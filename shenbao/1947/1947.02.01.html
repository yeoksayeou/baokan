<h3>卅六年度總預算案　立院全體會議通過　提出審查意見彙呈國府</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕卅六年度中央政府歲入歲出總預算案，經立院長時期縝密審查後，業於卅一日晨該院三一三次會議中通過。該案及立院所提具有建議性之審查意見，將一併彙呈國府。（審查意見全文見後）今晨立院會議由孫院長主席，有關各機關首長未列席，僅由各立根據五委會聯席審查會審查意見，及卅日質詢時各首長所作答覆，對歲入及歲出作審愼研討。歲出部門，尤其駢枝機關之裁撤，以省公帑各點，各立委咸有寳貴建議。收支差額，應如何籌補，審查時，亦殊重視。各立委咸盼政院能將穩定物便具體方案及各機關本年度施政計劃，送立院查考。全案於十一時許審查完畢，並予通過。</p>
<p>〔中央神南京卅一日電〕立法院發表對於中華民國三十六年度中央政府歲入歲出總預算案之審查意見如次：立法院對民國卅六年度中央政府歲入歲出總預算案之審查意見：</p>
<p>（一），歲入部份：（一）財政部主管各國家銀行及參有官股之其他銀行，所列盈餘收入，仍應分別再予酌增。（二）經濟部主管中國紡織公司所盈餘收入，增加過鉅，應就該公司內部機構人事嚴加調整，以撙節開支，不應再如前此所爲，迭决提高紗價，以致刺激一般物價。（三）接收敵僞財產租賃收入列數，與上年度相同，本年度物價上漲，應予酌增。（四）關於黃金外匯買賣，美軍剩餘物資及接收敵僞財產物資售價，應將詳細情形分別編製書面報吿送院參考。（五）凡卅六年度借入之外債，其實收及支配數額，均應折合國幣，列入總預算。（六）日本賠款數額龐大，應將本年度可能收入之賠款及物資，作價列入歲入部份，彌補預算差額。</p>
<p>駢枝機關應予裁撤擬訂方案穩定我的價</p>
<p>（二）歲出部份：（一）關於政權行使支出所列中央設計局，黨政工作考核委員會，及工作競賽推行委員會，均屬駢枝機關應予裁撤。（二）關於行政院主管所列最高經濟委員會，輸入設計專門委員會，輸入品管理處等機關，其組織多無法律根據，應予裁撤，將其業務分別劃歸主管機關辦理。（三）國防部之組織，過於龐大重複，應再予調整簡化，以節糜費，而增效能。（四）財政部所屬稅務，關務機構，組織複雜，亟應調整簡化，擬訂辦法送本院審議。（五）內政部主管之經費支出，最大部份均用於　政方面，對於戶政，民政，未能充分注意，應由主管部，就所列經費總額內，爲合理之調整。（六）糧食部應予裁撤，關於田賦之征收，仍交還財政部辦理，其軍糧之供應，仍交還國防部辦理。（七）善後救濟總署所辦之經常救濟事務，應移交社會部辦理。（八）僑務委員會所屬之法定機構，原爲僑務局，而非僑務處，故總預算中，該會所屬之第二項至第九項各單位，均應依法改正。</p>
<p>（三）其他：（一）本年度總預算收支差額之籌補方法，應由行政院提出法案，咨送本院審議，並應於最短期間，將穩定物價之具體方案，送本院查考。（二）本年度各機關之施政計劃，事業計劃，或營業計劃，在總預算中，均無詳細說明，致無從表現各部門之政策或中心工作，應由主管機關分別補送本院，以憑查考。（三）關於國營事業，應由各主管機關一律依法編造營業預算，送本院審議，本院迭有建議，亟應查照辦理。</p>
<h3>中加借款草案　完成立法手續　加將貸我加幣六千萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕中加借款合的草案，業經立院三十一日晨三一三次大會通過，完成立法手續。按該的係宋院長在加時與加總理在原則上談妥，細節則由加使劉師舜等協同與加財長商妥，根據合約，加政府將貸我加幣六千萬元，按年三釐計算，分三十年本息還淸，俾我購買加製貨物，其中二千五百萬元，購買我國原擬向加購買之互助物費及其他工業設備，其餘三千五百萬元，則購買我國所需之鐵路器材，船舶電訊器材等各種建設器材。</p>
<p>又立院通過該案時，以我國對外借款，往往事先未送立院審查，與法諸多未合，同時根據去歲審查總預算之決議，此類借款咸須於事先經立院審議，當決議，其他借款亦盼能照　加借款合約草案先例，先送立院。</p>
<h3>我進行借款　聞尙有四宗</h3>
<p>據外委會委長張肇元報吿，我國現與外國進行之借款，聞尙有四宗：（一）棉花借款三千三百萬美元。（二）鐵路器材借款一千六百萬美元。（三）電機器材借款八百八十萬美元。（四）船舶借款，數目不詳。</p>

<h3>陳立夫宴靑年黨</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕陳立夫卅一日晚就其寓邸，宴請靑年黨人士李璜，左舜生，余家菊，曾琦，劉東岩，楊永浚，劉泗英等進餐，前後並就改組政府事，交換意見，至九時始畢。記者於李璜氏登京滬夜車前，就詢其晤談內容，承吿：靑年黨認爲無論改組政府或參加國大，均係一本民主原則，而吾人之參加問題，首先必求得黨的自由，再及其他。</p>

<h3>政府將廣泛進行　政治與經濟改革　三中全會中將詳加討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳秘書長鐵城因病請假一月，來滬休養，現健康已有進步，日內即返京。昨對本報記者表示：國內戰亂擴大，誠至遺憾，惟政府已決定在治權達到之區或內，進行廣泛之政治經濟改革，具體方案將於三中全會中詳加討論後產生。在內亂不停之情形下，此爲一項艱難之工作，但只須執行時有勇氣決心與責任感，相信至少可完成一部份。論及美方最近之行動，吳氏謂：馬帥調停一年，因中共堅拒和平而無成，退出三人小組及軍調部乃必然之結果。惟此舉對於中美間歷史性之傳統友誼，並無影響。</p>

<h3>軍調部美方人員　需兩月始能撤竣　陸戰隊一部離塘沽反美</h3>

<h3>社論　如何推進出口貿易</h3>
<p>關於出口貿易，曾傳政府有特設機構，努力促進之議，出口各業，聞之極爲興奮，提議派員參加。我們認爲參加與否，尚屬次要，至於本問題的重要，却不僅出口各業應當興奮，便是其他各方面，與出口並無直接關係的，也應當興奮。</p>
<p>單從國際貿易，外匯資金，發展國產和維持國外市塲這幾點上觀察，本問題的重要性，已十分明顯。加上現行的通貨，己發展到非五千元，一萬元的票面，不够流通的地步，而海外僑匯，大部份，已橫溢到他方面去，所謂五億美金借款的前途究竟如何，又無從加以懸揣。在進口貨的結匯方面，雖一再從嚴審核，但據海關所製統計，各月入超的形勢，根本上並無變動。照此推論，則出口貿易的能否發展，實係整個的國家經濟問題，並不是出口商人的利害問題。</p>
<p>該會如何組織，所負的任務如何，現在還沒有正式宣佈。我們覺得茲事的確體大，願貢獻意見如下：</p>
<p>一，該會不可僅具諮詢的性質　現在應是行動的時候，不是討論的時候。議論多，成功少，決不足以饜一般人之期望。所以該會性質，應側重實施，不可限於議論。</p>
<p>二，該會不可僅具一般的行政性質　關於出口貿易，在一般的行政方面，無論布中央，在地方，並沒有不充分的感覺。假如增設一個專門的行政機構，無非在乎續上增多若干轉折，給商人們平添一個頂頭上司，實際上並無多大效用。所以通常行政性質的機構，我們認爲並不需要。</p>
<p>三，該會不可僅具輔導的性質　所謂輔導，即指技術的指導，消息的供給，運輸，保險，裝卸，及匯款等便利而言。在出口業尚在萌芽的時候，此等幫助，未嘗無相當價值。但要促進今日的出口貿易，此等幫助，顯然覺得不够。</p>
<p>總括地說起來，以上三端，皆不過是附帶的工作，切莫忘記了主要工作。主要工作伊何，即須直接担負起促進出口的任務來。</p>
<p>拿成例來說：凡由國家推進其出口貿易，其所採的手段，不外下列四種：（一）津貼，（二）收買，（三）免稅或减稅，（四）外匯或運輸等優待。現在出口稅己經全廢，第三點不成問題，其餘各點，何去何從，很值得研究。</p>
<p>假如採取第二點即收買政策，則（一四）兩點，便不生問題，其手續最爲簡單。而且收買生絲，業經施行有案，只須擴而充之，使包括到出口主要各品，則該會所負任　，己盡其大半。至於其他的便利，尚有幾點，如下：</p>
<p>一，收貿價格，不必悉受國外市價之拘束，生產者可以安心工作；</p>
<p>二，出售時，以該會對於此項物產，具有全部的控制權，對於條件之談判，自較為有利；</p>
<p>三，售貨所得資金，亳無走漏之弊；</p>
<p>四，由政府出面經營，在技術上，自比私人的力量爲優越。</p>
<p>不過上項計劃，如果付諸實施，却也有幾個信條，必須遵守。第一，不可以收益爲主義。政府辦理用口，其目的在推銷，其作用在救濟。至少在現階段中，應是無利可圖的生意。如錯會此意，處處從生意眼上着想，必將發生與預期相反的效果，大可不必多此一舉。第二，不可以剝削爲主義，即收買時，務須顧到生產者之血本是也。在高利貸壓迫，與出口停滯的兩重壓力下，如果扳起國孔，抑價收購，事實上，也許可以部份地做到，在貨借表上，並且易於討好。不過政府此次辦理出口，其主旨所在，當爲國人所共見。我們且不提藏富於民那類古話，但使業中人虧耗太多，望而生畏，便不是政府促進出口之初意。所以這個收買政策，如果確將採用的話，我們希望兼籌並顧，雙方爲出口前途，立下一個狠好的基礎。</p>

<h3>無錫以東廿一縣　本年農貸四百億　注重蠶絲漁業棉花三項</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州三十二日電〕中農行滙分仃農貨視察員周鴻文，三十一日在蘇答復本報記者，關於本年度農貸問題之詢問，茲綜合　　如次：本年度農貸，由滬分　管轄者計蘇省無錫以東廿一縣，爲蘇州，崑山，太倉，常熟，吳江，無錫，江陰，寳山，靑浦，松江，奉賢，南匯，川沙，南通，崇明，啓東，海門，上海縣等地，預擬計劃共四百億元，蘇州可獲廿五億，貸放性質注重於蠶絲漁業棉花三者，惟因款額極鉅，能否如數，尚須視總行資金情况而定。目前正開始辦理之農貸，已有多種，（一）春季蠶種抵押貸款，對象爲江浙兩省之蠶種塲，款額共廿億元，計每張蠶種可申請貸款二千元，月息小三分，淸償期限爲四月底。蘇省種塲有二分之一集中於滸　關，生產蠶種可卅萬餘張，故蘇州可單得貸放陸億餘元，該項貸款並不在蘇浙皖蠶桑貸款三百億元之額定內，目的純在維持種塲資金之週轉。（二）各種生產貨款，在四百億元未核定前，先由滬分行根據去年配額，暫定蘇州貸放四億元，計分甲，蠶戶貸款，包括催靑飼育等過程，每一蠶農飼種一張約可得三萬元。乙，製種貸款，根據生產成本，每張可貸六千元至八千元。丙，水利貸款，行總頃有口徑四吋八吋十二吋三種之　水機一批，農行準備調查，如合乎農村需要者，即可價購，以實物貸放。丁，肥料貸款，分化學及豆餅兩類，數量由農民團體申請決定，視實際需要核放實物。戊，養漁貸款。周氏末並告稱：際此政府對蠶絲政策尚未決定之時，蠶桑事業究竟應否扶植，雖不可知，而農民以養蠶爲副業，已有悠久歷史，我國蠶絲對外貿易，亦在國際市塲佔優勢，故目前農行計劃傾力支援蠶桑事業，惟對象不在購商而在蠶農本身，亦非此不足以言復興蠶桑也，希望今年各鄉蠶農，能自行組織，共同合作辦理乾繭運銷及繅絲工作，則農行可以儘量發放運銷及繅工貸款，希地方有識之士予以倡導。</p>

<h3>英政府召回駐華沙大使　英波關係益微妙</h3>
<p>英使館波籍女職員深夜遭逮捕</p>
<p>〔合社倫敦卅日電〕英外部發言人今夜宣稱：英駐波蘭大使彭丁克另有任用，短期內即頸召回。該發言人不欲以彭氏之調回，與英國對被蘭選舉之抗議併爲一談，僅謂彭氏已升遷。據悉，彭氏之調任不外下列諸因：（一）最近叛國案中，被告供出英大使曾接軍政機密情報；（二）波蘭選舉中政府派與反對派互相指責發生殺人事件，英國曾兩度向波籣政府抗議；（三）傳彭丁克聞曾於選舉後，與落選之農民黨領袖半柯拉齊克會晤。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華沙卅日電〕英國駐波蘭大使彭丁克，不久即將自華沙返國。按大使宣布返國係於英大使館情報佐理員瑪麗諾斯基夫人於昨深夜被捕後數小時。此一波蘭婦女，現年五十歲，被人控告有充任英大使館與波蘭地下組織聯絡官之嫌疑。據消息靈通人士談稱，此次被捕，實與格洛柯爾斯基事件有關。英大使對於此事，曾要求波蘭外部加以解釋，但迄未獲覆。據波籣外部發言人高各慈談稱，此事甚爲嚴重云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯支持波蘭　保有現行疆界　交成莫斯科會議爭執焦點</h3>
<p>〔路透神莫斯科三十日電〕權威方面稱：外長會議於三月間在莫斯科舉行時，蘇聯當要求保留小蘭目前之疆界，蘇聯報紙近亦屢有文字發表，闡述下屆外長會議所將討論之各項問題。如紅星報稱，英美政府屢圖干涉波蘭內政，意在使波蘭疆界作有利於德國之修正。該報繼舉出柏林及克里米亞會議議決恢復波蘭原有土地後對於波蘭之利益。如國防方面，目前德波疆界長四百公里，而根據凡爾賽條約則達一千九百公里之長，且德波新界係以河道爲界，而波籣在沿海可取得三大港及十四小港，使其有廣大之出海口。在領土方面，波蘭收回之土地達十萬另四千六百八十方公里，其中之四萊西亞，擁有廣大之天然資源。其他收復之土地，對於波蘭經濟之發展，亦莫不有重大貢獻。收復之耕地，將達一千四百八十二餘萬畝，可使缺乏土地之農民，不再有無地可耕之虞，且使國外遣歸之波籣每一家族，亦均可獲得相當之土地，不致再有過於擁擠之現象。該報最後復謂，波蘭人民皆知此等土地，若令德國再度佔有，將使波蘭屈服於英美及德國之責本主義之下，波蘭獨立之保持，實有賴於此等新土地之發展</p>
<h3>我對德奧和約　重申一貫主張　向四國政府建議兩點</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦卅日專電〕關於四外長代表討論對德奧和約事，中國政府於被邀請發表意見時，曾以節略分致英美蘇法政府，重申其一貫之主張，以爲根據波茨坦協定對歐洲各敵國和約之起草工作，雖山外長會議中曾經簽字於投降條款之會員國担任，但和會之召集以及一切有關和曾組織之程序問題，應由外長會議全體五個會員國事先協商決定。關於對奧條約，五强尤有協商必要，蓋波茨坦決議，根本未曾提及奧國也。聞中國政府提議：（一）對德奧和約應由聯合國中之有關各國，正式舉行一和會討諭之：（二）一切關於召開和會之程序問題，應由外長會議全體五個國家光行磋商決定。並聞中國政府表示，須俟此次程序問題獲得協議之後，始可提出有關德奧二約實質方面之意見，中國政府因此並未向四外長代表會議，作任何聲明或建議。</p>
<h3>奧代表申述　對和約願望　拒南領土要求</h3>

<p>四外次本日午後又討論德國問題，由捷克代表陳述意見稱：盟國必須嚴格管制德國，並以軍隊駐紮該國，直至其在軍事上，經濟上，及心理上均已解除軍備而後已。德國之統一，實頗爲危險，足以造成德奧之再度合併。在政治方面，捷代表團要求取消慕尼黑協定，至於經濟方面，則捷克要求恢復戰前情形，俾捷克能經由德國及在多瑙河·萊因河·與艾爾勃河上取得運輸及交通上之便利。</p>

<p>〔改造社東京卅一日電〕麥克阿瑟元帥今日下午三時下令禁止二月一日之全國大罷工。內務省繼即於四時通令全國地方長官，遵照麥帥命令，確保今後治安。麥帥聲明稱：余所以採取此項措置，乃爲防止公共福利遭受致命打擊，日本社會今日因戰敗而處於聯合國軍占領管制之下，其都市荒廢，其產業幾陷停頓，國民之大部分彷徨於飢餓錢上。罷工將破壤運輸與通信，阻止煤炭之移動，使產業活動陷於停頓的麻痺狀態，勢所難免，此事將使多數日人陷於災難之中，一如過去少數人驅使日人於戰爭之破壤。此事將陷聯合國於窘境，迫使其決定任由日本國民爲少數人陷於如此妄動之命運中，抑或犧牲聯合國自身缺乏之資源，而將必要以上之大量糧食及其他生活必需品無限制投入日本，以收拾事態。然余實不能要求聯合國人民負此重荷。余雖被迫採取此次非常措置，然此外對日本勞工爲達到正當目的而被賦與之行動自由，毫無加以限制之意。</p>

<h3>市府深夜緊張一幕　災戶消防員對質　一隊附撤職查辦　李壎查係誤扣可望保釋　今日續訪在塲美憲兵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火消防員凟職案，經五人調查委員會兩日之偵查，眞相已大白。市長曾就市府參事葛克信之報告，決定逐一扣押凟職人員，並由司法行政兩方面着手嚴予懲處。昨日重心已進入證人與消防員對質階段。上午則賡續調查。調查委員於九時齊集市府參事室，王垂慶並未應的前來，僅到王家三輪車夫阿福，賣橄欖長脚王萬本，武定路四九〇弄大餅店老闆李昌淸。阿福蹬言，並無新材料，對於二次大火發生於三樓之疑點，亦未說出詳細情形。王萬本與李昌淸對所詢各節，大抵諉稱不知，最可怪者，莫如日前指天發誓願充證人之王萬本，昨日一反常態，頻頻搖首以答矣。</p>
<p>昨日下午在市府會議室舉行之受害人與消防員對質，為全案澈查工作之最高潮，情緒緊張。據警局刑事處長稱：已扣凟職人員共七人，（昨均未及解地檢處）計：戴光榮（十一號），朱昌鶴（十七號），蔡治英（五八七號），尙志魁（三四〇號），黃寳琦（靜安寺區分隊長）李壎（區隊長），袁成鈞（一〇八號警士）。渠稱：戴光榮及尙志魁兩人，對於趁火打刧各點已在警局招供。惟十七號朱昌鶴供係銅匠，並不參加外勤，故渠懷疑或係廿七號，爲災主周企舫所錯認，唯周企舫則表示決不記錯，並謂對面當能指認。然於昨晚九時，調委會將扣押於警局中之嫌疑犯三人押解至市府，令周企舫指認時，發現頗多錯誤，彼指李壎爲十七號，指拘留所警士爲曾在火塲見過之戴平頂帽者，而對十七號朱昌鶴則稱不認得。李壎於陳述施救情形時，突然涕下，彼謂：本人赴火塲乃奉命收拾殘火，從未進入廿七號，於年初二早晨六時半即乘四九號車回區分隊，曾遇三九〇號警長，可由其作證。直至下午四時又奉葉科長命重趨火塲，其他時間始終留守隊部未會離去，一一三號警察當可爲余作證。至此，葛克信當表示李分隊長及十七號銅匠確係誤扣，應即交保釋出。督察處長張達因扣押之事，係奉市長之命，故兩人之釋放亦必須請命於市長。昨日因時間不及，未能保出，今日或可望交保釋放。</p>
<p>質詢時驚浪疊起</p>
<p>駕駛第一輛救火車到達火塲之靜安寺區區隊附朱慶瀾，於彼陳述完畢時，葛克信當即宣佈該區隊附朱慶瀾立即撤職查辦。彼謂：刻奉市長之命，該朱隊附負有總調度之職，責任重大，應即查辦。又於詢問楊樹浦分隊長周延丙時，周企舫從座上躍起指出，曾見該隊長又雲梯爬進廿七號三樓，未見爬出，恐或由隔壁走下。潘校長亦稱於火塲見過周隊長，致一時會塲空氣極爲緊張。結果因未獲得搜刦之且體證據，故朱予扣押。</p>
<p>又消防處長周兆祥，於出事後即着手澈查，官長隊員被訊問甚詳。昨日會末，葛克信曾請其公開發表，惟以時間不及（昨日質詢直至深夜十時始散），且調查工作尙未全部完畢，故須稍待數日。唯曾表示希望本案勿拖延時日，犯法者該辦則辦，該殺則殺，昨會並決定，自今日起在火塲設置意見箱，希望市民儘速提供證據及意見。調委會並定今日下午二時，續訪是日在塲協助施救之美軍憲兵。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕現扣押於警局拘留所之嫌疑人員七名，除李壎及朱昌鶴可能於今日奉市長之命交保釋放外，其餘五名，定今日送地檢處偵訊。又昨晨檢察官沈祖壽曾傳詢王雲甫及其家人。</p>
<h3>剷除敗類　市長致詞表示決心</h3>
<p>質詢於昨日下午三時假市府大禮堂開始舉行。除調查委員會五委員外，出席者有消防處處長周兆祥，警局刑事處長張師，監察使署張權，史繼良暨各報記者等，被傳之消防員十三人，首由吳市長致訓，略稱：對於這次西摩路大火，本人與宣局長所以特別重視之原因，希望全體消防隊員能够明白。本人深信多數消防人員都想把事情辦好，在敵僞時期有許多壤風氣，必須根絕，在今日消防員中，若仍有勒索打刧惡例存在，乃全體公務員之恥辱，爲政者自當查辦。我決非將全體消防負皆視爲罪犯，，我深信在你們中間，多數是奉公守法的，所以道次遭輿諭的攻擊者，乃係少數害羣之馬所帶累。爲了挽救整個消防隊的信譽起見，對此次失職人員必須加以嚴辦，深信這也必定是大家的意思。中國人往往吃了虧不敢說，待事過境遷後，即難求水落石出。此番組織調查委員會的目的亦在於此，希望各位亦能自動加以檢舉，不要把調查委員會看作審問機關，而趁此機會，剷除敗類。在公務員待遇無法提高之前，特定獎金辦法，凡特別勞力者，予以獎金以資鼓勵。深望各位自重，分明是非，海汰敗鷄，以保障消防隊之信譽。</p>
<p>吳市長詞畢，即告退出，質詢即行開始。到塲之高級消防員先行退出會堂，然後分別傳詢，由葛主任委員發問，然後由張處長及張參議員，侯區長等補充，列席之新聞記者亦特准發問，唯發言者甚少。調委於質詢時，語氣尚妥婉，主要之問題爲：何時接　警報？何時抵達大塲？水龍之分配情形？屬員之工作分配情形？言進入何屋？何時離去？及施救情形等。</p>
<h3>十三救火員被傳訊　強調並無失職情事</h3>
<p>昨日被傳訊者計有靜安寺區隊附　　瀾，新閘區隊附黃鍾秀，中央消防隊區隊附周悅寰，中央區　長徐立人，消防處第一科科長王文濤，消防處機械科長謝智庸　消防隊總隊長夏國樑，楊樹浦分隊長周延丙，虹口區分隊長强　林，及區隊附姜治經，宜昌路區隊附吳亦永，靜安區分隊長李　烈，中央區分隊長湯致羣等十三名。綜合其答辭內容，皆係報　富時努力撲救之情形，且强調消防人員並未有任何失職之處。　將其所答內容，分別誌之如下：</p>
<h3>趕到火塲第一車　朱龐大瀾詳述經過</h3>
<p>朱慶瀾（靜安寺區隊附）聲稱：接到警報時爲九時四十八分，立即準備出動，所乘之三五號救火車因天氣寒冷，曾一度踏不出來，開出後一路上頗爲順利，車子經過西摩路時，已見火勢甚旺，救火車係停於戈登路武定路口，最正確的時間約爲九時五十五分。係抵達火塲之第一輛，約過四分鐘後，水龍即行出水。向起火之四二五號撲救，經過半小時許，火頭已被控制，觀察當時之火勢係往橡膠廠方面延燒，即以苗子二根朝橡膠廠灌救。一根澆廿九號王家，另一則在火塲正面出水。時王家之木棚早已延燒，當時漂烟極大，以水龍將其衝散後曾見窗口胃白烟，且風向突然轉變，火頭向廿九號襲來，當即率領七六號消防員一名，隨帶苗子衝入廿九號施救，本人僅到二樓，即退出指揮其他工作人員。七六號消防員在王家內，待屋頂將坍時始引退，曾聞其聲調：一三樓實在站不住了。」至於當初未經使川搖梯原因，因廿五號車上無此設備，待新閘區第二輛救火車到達時，即借來施用。又消防員各人均隨帶小斧子一把，然均未見使用。</p>
<h3>黃鍾秀詳述經過　保證未入廿九號</h3>
<p>黃鍾秀（新閘區隊附）聲稱：　出動之時間已記不淸，祗記得僅較第一次警報遲五六分鐘，乘三三號車出發，停於武定路西摩路口。見火勢甚大，五家之木棚已焚燒，籬笆亦已坍下，半小時後熄滅，追隨身邊之五六人，保證未入廿九號，其他則難保。於第二次火起後，曾遇見美軍，彼等問：要帮忙否？答：要。美軍即以石塊擊破二樓窗戶上之玻璃，以便澆水。本人曾站於王家橱房頂層鉛皮上，以精子擊破二樓窗戶，以苗子澆水，至翌晨五時始行離開火塲，由楊樹浦分隊長周廷丙接班。</p>
<h3>壓住苗子　棄之逃命</h3>
<p>周悅寰（中央區隊附）聲稱：於十時五十五分接獲警報，乘三八號車，八分鐘後抵達火塲，停於江寗路東。到達時橡膠廠之火猶未息，王家三樓已坍，九十號及三六〇號曾隨本人進入王家二樓，二七八號及三四八號留守樓下，時電燈已告熄滅，未見有任何人出入，僅見有皮帶數根橫於地上。時二樓亦突告坍下，二七八號及二五〇號並當塲受傷帶，入之苗子被壓住無法抽出，即棄之逃命，現尚留於廿九號中之皮帶即是，離開火塲時間在翌晨五時左右。</p>
<h3>美軍兩人　協助澆水</h3>
<p>徐立人（中央區分隊長）聲稱：接到警報時爲十一時十五分，乘三一號車出發，八分鐘後抵達火塲，停於戈登路武定路口。時廿九號已無法進去，曾冒險衝入廿三號，發現施救亦已不及。即集中全力灌救廿一號，曾以鉗子將廿一號後門之大鎖毀壤開啓，但竟亦不能保，直至二樓坍下後始告退出，在三樓時曾見二美軍協助澆水。估計其進入廿一號當在吾等之前。</p>
<h3>王文濤說　房子不好</h3>
<p>王文濤（消防處第一科科長）聲稱：到達火塲時，已午夜一時二十分，全力灌救十五號及十號，事後檢討其蔓延主因，因雖各宅洋房之問均築有風火牆，但其問均有木架，互相穿通，火燄即藉此本架蔓延。該洋房建築之歷史，已達四十年之上，故缺點頗多，時式之房屋，當不致釀此大禍。當火勢熾盛時，曾使用洪水苗（即水力最大的苗）三至五只，火勢始告頓挫，大火高潮高過後，約於五時許離去。</p>
<p>謝智庸　（消防處機械科科長）聲稱；本人之任務不在救火而在留心車輛。曾通知通訊室電中央區　動車輛，並曾親赴火塲視察，僅聞六〇六號司機謂三十號車已壤，曾親赴察看之下，損壤者係水箱，但火塲中無法修理，然並不妨碍打水工作。</p>
<p>夏國樑　（消防處總隊長）聲稱：得到警報後，曾先後派出靜安寺區救火車　多輛，後因火勢旺盛，續派新閘區車四輛。曾親赴火塲，並試圖斫破屋頂鉛皮未果。於二十三日晨五時引退。事後，讀報章發表之種稱消防員失職行爲後，曾以二十年前之老友身份往國際飯店訪王雲甫，但王氏皆予否認。謂報章所載，絕無其事。</p>
<h3>周廷丙辯論結果　終認曾入廿七號</h3>
<p>周廷丙（楊樹浦分隊長）稱：於廿三日四時接到通知，赴火場接班時爲六時許，至下午一時離開，任務在於灌救殘火，曾分入廿九號，廿三號，十一號，五號救火，但廿七號一定沒有去過，因爲廿七魷無殘火。（後經廿七號災主周企舫，及西摩路國民小學校長潘文珍告以彼等曾目睹周廷丙以雲梯爬入廿七號，且當時廿七號火勢最大，周至此始予承認，但辯稱號碼弄不淸楚）。</p>
<h3>杜月笙楊虎　昨聯袂赴港</h3>
<p>地方協會會長杜月笙，遵醫囑於昨日乘法郵船前往得港休養，一俟滬市氣候轉暖，即行返滬。又海員特別黨部主委楊虎，慰問港奧一帶歸國海員及僑胞，與杜同輪赴港。</p>
<h3>強福林等叙述火景</h3>
<p>虹口區分隊長强福林聲稱：是日接報後係與區隊附姜治經於十二時二十分率同消防警士十一人乘三十二號帮浦車出動，抵達火塲後，車停於武定路上，皮帶則接於新閘路西摩路口之二〇九六號龍頭，時奉李區隊長命令灌救三號五號二撞市房，由姜隊附率領一九八，三三五，一四五號三警士隨琮苗子一根攀登五十五尺雲梯上屋，擬將屋頂鉛皮撬開向內灌水，本人則率警由五號入內，擬獎三層樓天花板打破，俾上下夾攻，詎至三樓後，室內已濃烟密佈，同時火勢已蔓延，不得已乃下樓，迨至下層時，二樓亦巳着火。時在屋頂灌救之一九八，一四五兩警士，因火焰冒出屋頂，到面部均被灼傷，處此情形下，惟有暫時撒離危險地區，而以「洪水苗子」與在塲之其他隊員採犄角之勢實季灌救，至翌晨五時許始奉命返隊。繼訊虹口區隊附姜治經，詞意大致相同。</p>
<h3>李承烈供　未曾救火</h3>
<p>靜安區分隊長李承烈聲稱；是日本人因接獲卅五號車油盡報告，故僅由　部送油赴火塲接濟，未參加救火。中央區分隊長湯致羣稱：因接三十一號三十八號兩救火車電話，要求再派車輛恊助，故於十二時廿分率同警士十三名乘四十六號率到塲，停於新閘路口，由區隊長指派工作，惟其時附近太平龍頭已爲先到者佔滿，故無法接水，直待至翌晨三時四十分回隊云。至此質訉完畢。</p>

<h3>參議會財政委會　舉行第九次會議　本年度市政建設捐　討論結果通過取消　送由議長核轉預算委會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本年度市政建設捐征收問題，有關市民負担甚大，但亦影饗市財政收人，故此案雖於市參議會第二次大會中曾一度討論，迄無結果，大會所決議者爲「待預算收支確定後，於必要時再行討論。」昨日下午三時，參議會財政委員會舉行第九次會議，當有董幹文。郭琳爽。勞敬修三參議員提議，史詠賡·沈鼎·王維　·顧葆羽等連署建議「預算委員會將三十六年度市政建設捐取銷，至於市府預算不足之數，請中央政府撥款補助，俾减輕市民負担。」常經討論甚久，通過取銷市政建設捐，一方面並通知預算會查照。</p>
<h3>請示中央補助　實如望梅止渴　谷局長請再予攷慮</h3>
<p>但據財政局谷局長春帆稱：征收卅六年度市政建設捐一案曾經市長提出，此項稅捐定爲的三百億元，爲市預算收入一主要項目，如取銷征收，關係重大，影饗市財政之深，莫過於此。務請再予攷慮。蓋向中央請求補助，實爲「望梅止渴」。谷局長並叙述請求之經驗，非常痛苦。本市收復以來，僅於去年四月間領到中央撥款六十億元，而新訂財政收支系統法頒布後，本年中央更無義務再予撥給。最近中央尚要上海支出六百億元之款項，更無法應付。實際上，征收市政建設捐對於市民負担並不可謂過大，計算目前征收最高數爲二十六年房屋租值之八十倍，若不收市政建設捐，則依法可將房捐增加，即重行估定房屋造價，則征收之數將爲戰前之八千倍或一萬倍。</p>
<h3>徐副議長表示　兼顧財政困難</h3>
<p>同時，徐副議長寄廎亦表示：當初市民反對市政建設捐，多數因不滿其冬季加倍。市財政收入困難亦應顧到，若不收市政建設捐，則勢必另征稅損，而車實上決不可能，則所少三百億元如何輛補，故建議暫緩有所決定，俟與預算委員會商討後再行決議。</p>
<p>最後對此案決議：「通過，送議長，副議長核轉預算委員會查照，如預算收支不能平衡，另由大會商討籌措辦法」。</p>
<p>惟對於卅五年度冬季房捐准財政局請求在中央新條例尚未頒布前，仍按秋季辦法征收。至房屋租值之估定，則仍按前工部局估定之標準，僅將倍數增加。</p>
<h3>酒菜業推代表　赴會請願</h3>
<p>本市酒菜業同業公會昨日下午推代表赴該會請願要求：（一）筵席稅起征點由五千元改爲一萬元（二）筵席稅由百分之十五减爲百分之十。（三）菜館有音樂跳舞設備而無舞女及營業性者准照筵席稅征收而勿按娛樂稅征收。（四）麵店筵席稅請豁免。當由王維駰參議員接見答覆稱：小組會議對大會決議案，不便推翻，僅能將請願各點提交大會考慮公決。</p>
<h3>市府單行法規　函請送會審核</h3>
<p>法規委會決議</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會法規委員會昨日下午三時在該會舉行第九决會議，決議案件計有：（一）函知市政府將各稱單行法規先行修正再送本會審查。（二）通知衛生局長及理髮業同業公會於下次會議派員列席說明後，俾審議理髮店規章。同樣請本市宰作業同業公會，鮮猪棧同業公會亦派員說明，以便審議各有關規章。</p>

<h3>輸血大王　業此已達十三年　供血三萬餘西西</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕愛里契賈可比，是一位專以輸血爲業的猶太人。在他十三年的輸血歷史中，他輸出了三萬六千立方公分的血液，眞可說是輸血大王了。</p>
<p>日前，他為聖心醫院中的一位俄籍病婦輸血，這已是他第九十六次輸血。現在，他正在家中休養。</p>
<p>上月初，他在半小時內，曾輸血兩次，並沒有感覺到任何不良反應，祗是需要營養豐富的食物而已。</p>
<p>一九二九年，在柏林，賈可比第一次輸血，爲了救治他的父親。但他的父親終於不救身死。不過，自此以後，買可比知這自己是O血型的人，可以爲任何一類血型的人輸血。四年以後，他就開始以轍血爲職業了。</p>
<p>到了一九一三年，希特勒當權，下令禁止以日耳曼「超人」的血液，輸入猶太人的血液中。德國的猶太人便自動組織了一個輸血機構，至一九三八年止，賈可比一共輸血六次。</p>
<p>不過，直到賈可比流亡到滬以後，他才單獨以輸血為生。</p>
<p>賈可比在德國的時候，本來是排字工人。但是，在上海，靠排字並不足維持他一家的生活，於是他就爲中華醫學會輸血。</p>
<p>自一九四一年三月以來，賈可比共輸血九十六次，包括各種國籍的病人，及宏恩，公濟和其他醫院。</p>
<p>九十六個人中，有一個人，曾遭受日憲兵隊的酷刑，倘不是買可比的輸血，便決沒有復生的希望了。</p>
<h3>招商局船舶修理所　開除工人起糾紛</h3>
<p>本市機廠街國營招商局第二船舶修理所，昨以縮小範圍爲由，在三百餘名工人中，開除工友八十六各，工人聞悉之下，甚感驚惶，當推代表吳信德等七人，懇請廠方收回成命未遂，發生糾紛，後赴一區造船業產業工會請求援助，該會已據情呈請社會局調解。</p>
<h3>碼關工人爭卸貨　軍警彈壓始息事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午五時左右，金陵東路外灘太古碼頭上有兩帮工人數十人，因爭奪工作，發生爭吵，一時形勢嚴重，幾釀成鬥毆，後經黃浦警局泰山警局及憲兵隊等出動警備車，派軍警到塲彈壓，始告無事。緣太古碼頭上下卸貨，戰前向由周瑞蓀一帮工人肩運，敵爲時期改由太古買辦陳義餘一帮工人包卸。勝利後，行政院曾有公事，准兩帮合作分担，但至去年五月十八日，市政府五令歸陳帮工人單獨工作，周帮工人因生活從此發生問題，曾壓次請願，未有結果，昨羣集碼頭上擬參加工作，因此發生糾紛。</p>
<h3>財局催報營業額　逾限將處以罰款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市卅五年秋季營業稅，財政局前經規定於二月五日爲申報營業額限期。現該項限期，迅將屆滿，聞財局方面決定，凡逾限仍未申報者，決依營業稅法第十七條之規定，處以罰款，並逕行決定其營業稅額。各稅商不得聲明不服。</p>
<h3>直接稅變通辦法　可申請可是賬核減</h3>
<p>上海直接稅局局長，已由團團威氏接在。聞財政部對於本市稅收，甚為重視，其卅四年度第一類營利專業所利得稅之未收部份，催促尤力，樓氏近正與各有關方面商談催繳及結束辦法。據市商會稅務專門委員會透露消息，前所議定之二百億預算，尚未足額，而各戶之因不勝負担申請查帳核减者，已有多起，應爲之核實减輕，其遭遇虧損，或尚未復業，未辦申報，致受稅局按資本估計征稅無力繳納者，亦應查明免繳，稅局方面可能即照此原則辦一結束。其並無上開各項困難，而延不繳稅者，稅局將依法嚴辦。又據稅局某負責人談稱，其依簡化稽征辦法估定稅額尚未　鐵者，除能證明其爲虧損或盒未營業者外，依法應先納百分之四十稅款，並同時檢具帳册，申請覆查，否則祗有移送法院，依法科處。又稱，國庫年度，將於二月十日屆滿，三十四年度之稅，萬難再延云。</p>
<h3>檢查旅館　改善辦法</h3>
<p>本市軍警當局向對旅館檢查，極爲認眞深恐不肖之徒，混雜其間，惟一般正當旅客，對於夜間檢查一點，均感有擾淸夢，咸望軍警當局，予以改善，市參議會正副議長潘公展。徐寄廎兩氏，昨特聯名致函淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾氏，請求對旅業之檢查，予以改善。該部接獲是項函件後，當予函復，略以改善旅業檢查，該部業已擬定辦法，一俟宣司令由京返滬批閱核准後，即予實施云。</p>

<p>趙局長並稱：對於行駛電車及製造自來水較他項公用事業用電特多者，仍暫不加收此項附加費，以免電車及自來水同時加價，增重市民負担。至於煤氣價格與煤斤加價，最有直接關係，自不能不隨同調整，其每度應加若干，正在審愼核議中。</p>

<h3>米市塲仍少正式交易　場外喊價繼續開展　雜糧油餅各市無不齊漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米糧到源益稀，市况依然時鬆暗緊，南北市到貨共僅一千八百石左右，市塲仍少正式交易，塲外粳米續漲三四千元，秈米及白元陰元均各漲二三千元，當局對此情形，極爲關切，社局繼續於南北兩市塲拋售　米六千七百五十包，米商納胃甚佳。該局決於今日在南北兩市塲拋售　米兩萬石，以抑漲風。</p>
<p>據社會局糧食科長吉明齋稱：本市存米並不缺乏，因所有糧食倉庫貯滿，更有向外租棧者。此次火價上漲，恐因時值新年，農人忙於度歲，故來源較少。加以受物價刺激，產地價高，鄉人亦多抱觀望態度。</p>
<p>本市米店菜有二千餘家，需要亦股。自開關以來，社會局已共拋出西貢米二萬二千五百五十包。計一月二十七日拋出一萬二千四百六十包。二十八日拋出三百二十包。二十九日拋出一百六十包。三十日拋出二千七百六十包。昨日拋出六千八百五十包。今後如有需要，社會局可隨時繼續拋售。吉科長並告記者稱：下星期內米價可告平穩。</p>
<p>昨日米價評議會會召開會議，但未有任何具體決議。米號業同業公會昨亦開會，決定將門售商之困難情形報告當局，並將請求市長，希當局除拋售西貢米外，對於田賦征實米亦能賣出一部份，以抑平市面。</p>
<p>又據傳大量暹羅緬甸洋米，正源源來華。由曼谷裝運之首批八千五百噸已於春節期內到滬，第二批於近日內亦可到達，當局已向暹羅緬甸訂購洋米十萬噸，並向越南以及其他各產米國家訂購洋米十四萬噸。</p>
<p>汕市消化略活，生油回漲三四千元，淸油菜油則少上落，生蔴油亦無波動，惟小車蔴油亦加三五千元，豆油仍少，豆餅厦門泉州動而不旺，但各物上漲，隨之加升三四百元，黄豆油廠猛吸，本街競納，飛漲三千元，紅糧久未見貨，酒坊需要甚貪，猛烈上漲，飛奔六七千元。生仁廣帮依然暢辦，飛黃騰達，暴漲七八千元，赤豆亦漲四五千元，菉豆堅定，芝蔴白蔴續升二三千元，黄蔴胃呆少神，麵粉異常活絡，再漲二三千元，麩皮早緊午懈，軋升三五百元，各糧一致狂漲不已。</p>
<h3>金鈔扶持得力　華股形勢尙穩</h3>
<p>華股昨尙穩定，金鈔之助力，得以支持不墮，晨開平穩，政治局勢雖吿惡劣，但以金市尙秀，經一〇五號一七八號來進，遞永紗即升至八二午後金市見俏，六三號八四號一七三號上塲即進而趨昂，中途雖盤，無奈金價有進無退，一八〇號一八五號一八六號一四五號等連袂有納，最後以高價結束，結果較前收計永紗美亞信和景福勤興華豐各升半成強，新光所升不多，遞交永紗信和華豐各漲半成強，美亞升一成，新光所升不多，冷股交易不多，並未變化，塲外各股，仍形平穩。</p>
<p>外股昨墾植在煤礦有利消息下，各方仍有搜收，以致續形向榮，餘均在穩定狀態下盤旋，結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐怡啤航業鋼業紙業均告微升，墾植升半成，業廣平平。</p>
<h3>公債平穩</h3>

<h3>張家口春節　連宵瑞雪兆豐年</h3>
<p>— 本報記者竭忠</p>
<p>廿一日張垣航訊</p>
<p>在人民心目中，國曆元旦是「公家」的年，掛國旗，貼春聯，開會慶祝，不過是應付「公家」而已，只有春節，才算眞正過年，年齡增長是從這一天來計算，一年的辛勞，要在過年中獲得補償與安慰，平常吃不上肉的人家，都要在今天吃頓「餃子」大年初一就是老牛老馬亦要休息一天。</p>
<p>春節　平淡沉默</p>
<p>張家口今年春節，是在平淡沉默中度過。連爆竹聲亦朱聽到。春節的前夕，陰雲密佈，雪花飛舞，大地披上銀色的外衣，街頭搖曳着幾　星火似的路燈，這情量比舞應裏專爲聖誕節而作的佈置，更顯的自然美麗，但街頭戒嚴提早到下午六時，良辰美量又有誰來欣賞？</p>
<p>前夜　處處哨崗</p>
<p>軍事當局爲了提高警覺，防範意外，當兵的人們遠在十八日就提前過了年，軍隊裏過年，大家都吃了一頓「餃子」。春節前夜，士兵們幾全體出動，戒備嚴密，如臨大敵，路上行人少，處處有哨崗，人們雖感到極大不便利，但爲了自身安全，又有什麽辦法？</p>
<p>機關　四不運動</p>
<p>各機關雖沒有明令放假，在「人情」與「習慣」上，不能不有一天「例假」休息。當局爲了推行節約，曾由有關機關倡導四不運動，即不送禮，不拜年，不宴客，不給壓歲錢。各機關首長又多領導屬員簽名力行，假定觸犯了四不運動，當事者的芳名就會在報紙上揭露，這一來讓許多「愛體面」的人，亦得到了充分口實。本來，在目前物價飛騰待遇微薄的窮公敎人員，「打腫了臉裝胖子」，實在太沒必要，節約的風尚與環境，總應當養成。</p>
<p>創痕　難於平復</p>
<p>察省人民回憶過去的一年，像是一塲惡夢，共軍的暴政，在人民的心實上，已留下不可平復的創痕！貨運不暢，商集不振，工商被破讓，千百人失業；交通被截斷，多少人不能還鄉，子女被裹走，骨肉不能團圓。「淸算」，「鬥爭」，苛征暴歛，把人民的生活推進飢寒困苦的邊緣，祟禮屠城，龍關血案，什麽力量能攫去這慘痛恐懼的回憶！</p>
<p>新年　新的希望</p>
<p>新年來了，帶來了新的希望。春節的早晨，雪停住了，太陽撕破，綿軟的基幕，給人間投下溫柔的陽光，人民亦露出了希望的微笑，把僅有的新裝穿上，那怕是僅有的一雙新鞋和一條腰帶，婦女們濃濃的塗上了一層脂粉，商號雖緊緊的閉上了大門，街頭的人熙熈攘，並不顯得冷落。公務人員相見，齊道聲：「過年好」！商民仍彈着「見面發財」的老調。</p>
<p>瑞雪　連夜飛降</p>
<p>這幾天，總是連夜降雪，亦許是瑞雪豐年的徵兆。一年來兵連禍結，人民再經不起天災荒學，尤其處在國共兩軍夾縫中的人民，大軍震集，直接增加人民的負担，互相封鎖，斷絕往來，城市沒有燃料食糧，鄉村沒有布疋及日用物資，直到今天人民才更親切的體騐到「沒有匯乏與沒有恐懼自由」的迫切。每個人都眼巴巴的渴望安定與和平，人民巳不能忍受戰爭的熬煎，農村經濟已瀕破產，當他們運生命都失掉保障的時候，總有一天，會伸出了憤怒的拳頭，向着好戰殘桑的共軍。</p>
<p>省府　主席就職</p>
<p>察省府主席傅作義與各委員廳長是在一月十五日宣誓就職，隨着春節以後，將有一次行政會議的召集，討論今年的施政方針，如何讓紙面上的文章變成行動。今天的察省，像是破落的家庭走向復興，滿目瘡痍，百政待舉，一切都需要明快與效率，我們催促着新察哈爾的實現！</p>
<p>過去的不幸，隨着殘年永遠逝去吧！春到人間，我們希望能給人民帶來安定和平的禮物，讓他們凄凉的心情，接受溫暖的潤澤。</p>
<h3>南國春雨</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>廿五日廣州航訊</p>
<p>大概因為國暦推行的時間尚短，而數千年沿用的農歷有了深長歷史的緣故吧，所以國曆的新年始終沒有農曆新年那樣熱鬧；就在廣州來看，新曆顯然是很平淡的便過去了，而這個農曆新年的降臨，是多麼的熟鬧而緊張啊！</p>
<p>細雨綿綿不減熱鬧</p>
<p>有人說：新曆年是「官」過的，舊曆年才是「民」過的；這話雖未必全是道理，但我們却不能不承認：惟有農曆新年才是普天同慶的大衆假日，因爲這幾天恐怕上至官員，下至百姓，都無不暫時放下他們的工作，而略爲休息吧！所以新春降臨，商店固然休息，學校也早已放寒假，機關裏雖然沒有明令放假，但自由行動的「黑市假」起碼也有幾天，就連「聯總」和「領事館」等外國人管理的機關也沒有例外，因此在春節幾天，雖然老天爺未免掃興，連日下着綿綿細雨，但街上却仍不减熱鬧；終日爆竹震天，人們在泥濘的道上，擠來擠去，有若干較繁盛的馬路，更擠得太洩不通；這熙來攘往的人們，都無不呈現着非常愉快的顏色，大槪大家都有着一個共同的希望，就時「今年勝似往年」吧。</p>
<p>不景氣中消費驚人</p>
<p>在這新春佳節裏，最使廣州人頭痛的，就是春雨綿綿，打破了那些淸雅人士作郊外春遊的計劃；，而各茶樓酒家又早已「歲晚收爐」，要到舊曆初四或初七始啓市；致使這一百二十多萬的市民，都大部份祗有　到娛樂塲所去尋求消遺。所以這幾天來，全市的戲院和舞應，都實在熱鬧案前；總計全市電影院有十四家，每日日夜放映五塲，和粵劇塲六家，日夜兩塲，幾乎每一塲都是人山人海，要買戲票實在比領救濟米還要困難；再說舞塲吧！在這幾天裏面，不管會跳不會跳的人，都歡喜到舞塲去趁趁熱鬧，連鄉下大姑娘也趁着這個新年機會去白相一下，在舞池內實在擠得運身也轉不過來；這裏雖然大小一共有三十多家舞塲，但每家都是一樣的擁擠。戲院和舞塲的老板，固然笑逐顏開，而貨腰孃子們也自然「大有收穫」了！有人統計道三天內的娛樂消費，祗戲院方面已達三億元以上，而三十多家的舞塲，直接和間接的消費，當更不止此數；在此百業凋敝的不景氣當中，而亦有此龐大的消費數字，實不可謂不驚人吧！</p>
<p>街車改觀氣象一新</p>
<p>廣州市面，隨着新年降臨誠然是添了不少新的氣象。最顯著的，要算是公共汽車一改舊觀；在剛光復時，為了維持市內交通，也曾因陋就簡的將載貨的卡車來改裝公共汽車，這些車廂委實太不像樣了，而且經過一年多，所有車廂大半破爛；最近市政當局似乎來過一番的改善，就在春節前後，已有大批的新型公共汽車在市上行走，同時路綫也在農歷除夕起，重新改編，使每一條馬路都幾乎有公共汽車經過，不像以前集中在一些繁盛的地方，這自然是很合理的，市民們也無不稱便。不過仍有美中不足的，就是馬路還是一樣坎坷不平，仍然未見修理得好，雖然換了好的車子，還是一樣眞得要命；尤其在這幾天來，春雨霏霏，路上泥濘盈尺，汽車過處，泥沫橫飛；還有這幾天那些淸道夫爲了休息過年，致路上一堆堆拉圾無人淸理，臭氣薰天，這眞是大煞風景了！</p>
<p>各界推行盛大運動</p>
<p>今年春節，廣州各界正積推行着一個盛大的運動，就是要求將廣州改爲特別市，這事情是與一百二十多萬市民有切身關係，所以這遝動終予大家莫大的興奮。本來廣州改爲特別市，所有條件都具備，然遲遲不能改的原因，就是因爲她是省會所在地；如果廣州改爲院轄市，那省府便要搬家，而廣東又沒有一個相當於江蘇的鎮江，或者四川的成都這樣市鎮，足以作爲省會的，於是這問題便被延擱下來。可是這使廣州的復興建設，又受到很大的阻碍，因爲廣州是省轄市，建設費異常支絀，目前如校舍的復建，馬路的修補，社會救濟的興辦，地方的淸潔，警務的整頓，市府均無法逐一舉辦，迫得向市民派捐，而增重市民的負祖；所以市參議會和數十個民衆社團，便發起了這個要求「改特」運動，並於農曆元且日聯合上電蔣主席要求，理由有以（一）廣州爲革命策源地，國父曾詳定爲特別市；（二）人口逾百萬，具有特別市的一切條件；（三）在地理曾爲南方重鎮，直接國際交通與貿易，同時政治經濟更具有特殊情形；（四）不能因　　　在地，而　　其他　　　　。</p>
<p>至於省府方面對於這個問題，則還沒有什麽表示；記者會訪民政廳長李揚敬氏，祗答謂「一切遵　中央法令辦理」。及最近得到的消息，這裏市參會的呈文，早已送達蔣主席核批，可能與瀋陽，長春，漢口等三市同時作一決定，大槪人命令不久便會下來，究竟廣州「改特」能否實現，相信不久便分曉了。</p>
<p>雨呈佳兆物有漲風</p>
<p>按農曆，今年是丁亥年，流年屬猪，照理今年過後，一切物價都還是不斷呈現上漲之勢，米價亦漲至每担八萬元；黃金外幣，還是激揚，在新年三天，黃金昇至四萬八至四萬九，港幣由一四〇〇至一四九〇，所以展望今年的一切物價，恐怕祗是有增無减，而今年生活困難的程度，亦不見得會遜於去年吧！不過，在這裏有一個聊以自慰的，就是今年春節雨量充足，據農家的看法，這是豐年的朕兆哩。</p>
<h3>元旦悲劇　「示衆」在太原</h3>
<p>— 李璧</p>
<p>三土太原航訊</p>
<p>奮鬥辭舊歲，復興迎新年。元旦日這天，在山西說是復興工作開始的一夭，在國家說是頒憲的時候，因此記者帶着快樂的心情在狹小街頭上瀏覽一週，雖北風襲人，但未感到寒意，這也許是太興奮的原故吧，五光十色的壁報和紅紅綠錄的標語，觸目皆是，解艷的國旗在家家戶戶的門前飄蕩飛舞着，商店的玻璃橱上，可看到：「慶祝元旦减價三天」的紅紙條，影劇院門口，也貼上了「慶祝憲法公佈，半價售票三夭」。在此慶祝聲中，悲劇源源發生，奇怪的是一天一幕，配合的很適當，第一幕是梟首示衆，第二幕是汽車肇禍，第三幕是姦殺慘案，其中最轟動的是第一案，現將經過情形簡報於下；</p>
<p>身首異處鮮血直流</p>
<p>元旦晚十時許，記者從電影院返家時，走至太原最熱鬧之地方—柳巷南口，忽立着幾個糾糾武裝的哨兵，並且是嚴禁通行，其實已聚集了人山人海，想走也走不過去，只聽人說：「這人眞倒霉，不好好過年，偏要逛妓院，結果腦袋搬家了，」記者聽後覺得很奇怪，逛妓院還犯死罪嗎？好容易乘着哨兵檔駕別人的時候，即迅速偷跑入人叢中，又費了九牛二虎之力，總算突入重圍，一眼瞧見的是：地下躺着一個沒腦袋屍身，一抬頭，呀，亨得利鐘表眼鏡行的門口電桿上，正有個人在掛人頭，頭下的血，尚在斷斷續續滴着，面目看不大淸楚，年齡不過廿餘歲，在細看屍身，好似大字形的橫陳街心，穿着一身灰棉新軍服，足登一雙日本式的皮絨靴，看情形頸上砍的決不止七八刀，肉皮向外縮回，看的人都帶着悲慘的面孔，經記者環視，未見有一人面帶笑容者。有幾位婦女將頭低下，以手絹拭眼淚。在此陰森的空氣中，雖然人不少，但是靜悄悄的，無一人高聲說話，有之，都是以極低之聲音交談着，究竟爲甚麽在今天殺人，誰也不知道，有人低聲說：「眞慘，臨死時還說，我僅看了一下，就殺我嗎」？</p>
<p>擾亂治安就地正法</p>
<p>翌日一早起來，再至柳巷探詢究竟，祗見人比昨晚多了好多倍，半條已堆滿了人，看情勢是無論如何不會再衝進去的，後來聽朋友說：「海十邊貼有佈告」記者又匆匆的跑到海十邊貼佈告處，果見團了一圈人，好在佈吿貼的並不低，只見上寫道：</p>
<p>「為佈吿事：查文明國家的國民遵守秩序，文明國家的軍隊，嚴守紀律，元且之夜，竟有輔重兵團張問政·票森槐二名，在羣衆娛樂之際，乘機破壤秩序，擾亂治安，經軍警扣獲，當即就地正法，以昭　戒，爾後凡有類此不法之行為，格殺鐵論，特此佈吿，一體週知，此佈。計開張問政，定襄人，廿五歲，輜重兵團中士，栗森槐，崞縣人，廿二歲，輜重兵團三營八運准尉特務長」。</p>
<p>頭懸巷口屍陳墻邊</p>
<p>記者這時才知道死者原來犯了破壤秩序擾亂治安罪，眞正該殺、殺一可以做百，可是還有一名殺在甚麽地方呢？有人說在四道巷，於是又跑到了四道巷。老達就看見人頭懸在頭道巷口的大門上，屍身陳列在墻邊，也是穿着新灰棉軍服，多半個後腦已經沒有了，頭下尚連着絮絮吊吊的小肉塊，地下有血跡一塊，記者不忍卒睹。返回時已快到十二點，不知爲甚麽竟沒人殮屍。</p>
<p>孫司令談處理經過</p>
<p>這裏記者將孫司令（前警備司令孫福麟）對幷市記者所談的處理經過，寫在下面：「昨爲元旦節，各機關率令放假三日，各街遊人甚衆，尤以娛樂塲所爲甚，昨日下午八時許，舊城街四通巷有身着灰服之軍人，約四十甚人，因與其他部隊在某妓院因事發生衝突，秩序頓形紊亂，形勢嚴重，軍警聞訊趕到，上前勸解，渠等非但不服制止，反而更餘，後保安司令部得悉，當即派官兵馳往彈堅，至時大部聞訊潛逃，常塲抓獲贛重兵團中士張問政及三營八速特務長票森槐二名，遂提押到部，經訊供認聚衆擾亂秩序不諱，依法判處死刑，經呈奉核准，就地　首示衆，以昭　戒，當時九時三十分將該犯等，分別押解至柳巷南口及四道巷口處決。</p>
<p>還有×報的幾句話，可知出事時之情形：一個買賣人低聲說：「昨天九點多鐘，兩個人追殺這個人，頭巳經砍了，身子還跑了幾步，然後跌倒」。衆人聽之昨舌。</p>
<p>志門失火殃及池魚</p>
<p>這個新聞於三日（二日休息）登載各報，某報因載有一輜重兵團四十餘人」之文字，故輜重兵團認爲與事實不符，特去函更正，時謂：本團聞出事後，於次日早九時，即派副官周德前往四道巷調查眞象，據報稱，經詢問附近街公所與商民並寳花堂老板姑娘等，均聲稱打架部份，雙方固各有三四十名，但均係着黃軍服者。本團係穿着灰棉軍衣，該等旣經「城門失火，殃及池魚」，又云敝團士兵四十餘人與某部互相毆打，均與事實不符。</p>
<h3>昆明沒有冬天？</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員徐繼濂</p>
<p>昆明十四日航訊</p>
<p>人們都說昆明是沒有冬天的，其實豈僅沒有冬天，何嘗又有夏季？所以不會汗出如瀋，火傘高張，同時也不用升起爐子，穿着厚厚的狐皮袍。在山城，天候確實沒有話說，夏天解得上是避暑勝地，冬天更爲畏寒無衣人們的樂園！</p>
<p>江南此日，該正是瑟手縮脚，升火衣裘的時候，然而昆明却還從不曾想起天寒衣單，說來眞敎人難於置信，這裏除了一早一晚寒凉一點，白天，身體結實的人是可以穿夾衣裳不覺得冷的。太腸一早就昇了起來，而且還是那樣溫煦暖人，沒有厭倦，不會偏袒，它是永遠柔和地照耀着山城！</p>
<p>氣候得天獨厚商塲面臨嚴冬</p>
<p>氣候雖是得天獨厚，無分寒暑，但，在人爲的世界裏，却正是億得一切都面臨着嚴冬的，而且，天候的溫暖熱烙不了一肚子酸辛的人們，其中表現得最爲凸出的，尤其是在生意塲上厮混的一羣。</p>
<p>昆明過去一向被稱爲冒險家的樂園，掘金者所擁有一塊肥沃的土地，只是好景不常，而今這一片樂土也嗜到了苦果的滋味，土基上是不能建築起鋼骨水泥的高樓的，以往一些投機者粉飾了一個講究的門面，拚命在外表上下功夫，時日一久，門面上的粉漆斑駁，終於要顯露出廬山眞面目，於是原形出來了，它不僅使危樓里的人振不起身子，連在外邊看熱鬧的人也倒抽了一口冷氣，想着：原來是道麽一幅醜惡的形相！</p>
<p>高利貸不景氣天天賒天天倒</p>
<p>高利貸首先遭了霉運，在昆明，「天天賒」的潛勢力是最大的，它掌握着小民們的生死大權，其普遍深入爲任何信用貸款所不及，以此「天天賒」便成爲了商業銀行最感頭疼的對頭，因爲「天天賒」對老百姓最方便，手續簡單，而且不消受銀行里小職員那一付難看的嘴臉，取付容易，以此賒社便有如雨後春笋地成立起來短短幾個月之間竟達百餘家之多，吸取存款的對象自然以小民爲絕多數，市當局想到日後危機堪虞，於是規定了許多管理的辦法，哪知還正在登記期中，賒社的「賒頭」們已經支持不住，紛紛拐款潛逃，這樣一來，造成了老百姓們的恐懼心理，乃先後退賒不納，賒頭們根本便短於資金，當初能够維持外表的原因，員全是依賴着二十四分的高利貸，東扯西拉，不致垮台，而今倒風旣起，總崩潰便開始了，此倒彼落，使昆明經濟陷入了深重的危機！</p>
<p>正義路要翻修近日樓感孤寂</p>
<p>不管市况如何不景，市面的繁榮工作總是必須對付一番的，正義路巍然屹立的三牌坊，也顧不了耆紳和篤信風水人們的反對，終於拆除了，近日樓頭論戰的壁報和標語已經一掃而光，四周牆壁都粉刷一新，過去那種七零八落，東一張，西一塊的情景，在一紙「整飭市容」的命令之下「雨過天靑」，冬天的近日樓也有點感到孤寂。</p>
<p>山城的路政是相當糟的，除了有一條平坦的太和街以外，其他都是崎嶇不平，行人不勝巔簸之苦，因之當局乃將重修正義路列爲本年度市政中心工作之一，目前已經開始與工，修築之期當在不遠，說來正義路實在也該改築一番，因爲連「有車階級」也隨時有着「覆車」的憂慮，遑論一些「跑街先生」？</p>
<p>裁員問題嚴重七十老翁自殺</p>
<p>提起裁員，滇垣這一次是做得相當澈底，自省府以至於各廳處各機關，都雷厲風行地「整肅」了一下，被裁人數都佔全數的三分之一左右，有的代爲安插，有的便是一裁了事，自然其間悲劇甚多，被裁的人正有着不盡的憂慮，面對着新年又是舊年，一家人都暍着西北風，這滋味也只有身歷其境的人才能體會，比如最近雲南測量局的一個技工，前淸宣統三年便投入該局，論時間不能算短，而且服務的成績也很好，可是終於被遺散了。孤另另的一個人，旣無妻室，又鮮十女，年紀已經七十歲，照想再拖過兩年也就差不多，但是肚子不答應他，終於吞服了四錢上好雲土，一命鳴呼，連喪葬後事都是生前的同事料理，這和悲慘的事實，正是山志冬天裏的插曲！</p>
<p>昆明溫暖的冬天又走到盡頭了，只是冷酷的現實緊壓着人們，當春天降臨大地時，人們只是以苦笑迎接着那一連串的日子！</p>
<p>更正　茲據外交部情報司稱：卅五年十二月二日本報所刋曼谷航訊「暹羅僑胞」文中提及官員勒索貪污，台僑這送一案受賄達遷幣一百萬餘　，及李大使忙於交際宴會而不交涉處理中　懸案等語，經查並無事實根據。復據遜羅中華商會函稱：該通訊中謂僑領因受僑胞攻擊與興論指摘，使自己掏荷包辦報紙云云，均屬無　。據此合亟更正。</p>
<h3>軍官總隊生活縮影</h3>
<p>軍官總隊，不僅在南昌，而且在全國享有着廣大的聲譽。其日常生活，頗爲豐富而具有興趣。（一）軍官總隊每早點名後舉行升旗，國旗於晨曦中緩緩上昇，正象徵中國前途之偉大與總隊蓬勃之朝氣。（二）軍官總隊利用駐地附近荒地，勤力開墾，完成菜圃，從事種植。（三）此乃日寇建築之野戰醫院，經軍官總隊修整後，利用作隊員宿舍。（四）敎官上課時之情形。　（本報特派員房滄浪攝）</p>

<h3>一個「志願兵」的傳奇</h3>
<p>— 王紀</p>
<p>啷啷啷……</p>
<p>汽輪的笛子每天不爽時地劃破這小鎭的寗寂，男女老少爭先恐後的從灶間裹，厕所上，或羊棚頭奔出來了，來看這從來很少見的「火輪船」。</p>
<p>從這個縣到那個縣，小鎭幸運地成了這麼一條孔道，使這羣近乎原始的人民得能廣廣眼界；或者，也有那麽幾個「上等人」沾沾牠的光。日子長久了，航船再抵擋不住這「火輪船」，船戶們開始妒忌了，在査問：</p>
<p>『這是誰的船，把個狹窄的河道全攪混了？』</p>
<p>原始的人民對這麼個「奄無用處」的「怪物」開始有點討厭了。</p>
<p>是誰的船呢？有一天在茶館酒樓上終於哄傳了開來。……</p>
<p>離鎭不滿五里的胡浦漾有條出名的嬾虫，爺是個烟鬼，原也有點「家私」，游擊隊拿他當過「財神爺」，沒榨出錢，給了個「犯國法」，槍斃了。兒子胡勝祥見爺這麼把份家產抽進烟斗去，又丟了命；走頭無路，也投靠游擊隊，拜過「寄爺」，結果少不了學上那副「游腔」：牽牛啦，割稻穗啦，還給日本人當過伙伕；「慘勝」之後，胡勝祥沒有「勝」掉那種作風，反而變本加厲，小鎭常常受他「侵損」。他自命爲「好漢」，小鎭的居民却送他一個不雅的頭物：小流氓。</p>
<p>徵兵來了。</p>
<p>徵兵的聲浪比徵糧更強烈地挑起小鎭的騷動。一保二丁啦；　密抽籤啦。……開油條店的停鍋了，磨豆腐的趁黑早走掉了，店舖子裏不大看得到年靑人，小　一天比一天在熄滅牠的生氣。</p>
<p>鎭公所，保辦公處，戶籍幹事們　炳了戶口册。……要申請　，儘繳了什麽什麽證件，走路　胸膛挺的怪起，衣襟上的什麽什麽證章亮晃晃地耀人眼。大多數走不掉又弄不到什麼什麽證件的好像今天裏埀死的蒼蠅，往希望裏掙扎，掙扎：請求五戶連保說是獨子吧，偏有個分居了幾年的哥哥還在；怕吿密，誰敢擔這個保？說是要負擔家庭嗎，保長說你的攤兒不是値上幾十萬？</p>
<p>抽韱日子近了，壯丁們像些待決的囚犯，『中了呢，我準備逃，誰願意去打內戰？呸，才鬼話。』</p>
<p>兵役督導員的言辭增添了壯丁們無限的憎恨。怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>一天傍晚，離開「密抽」不到一個星期吧，縣裏忽然來了道公事，說政府要募志願兵；佈告也出了：說「准予抵補應徵名額」，說「可予精神及物質上之援助」。</p>
<p>〔物質，哦，物質！〕</p>
<p>這扇門扉終於好不容易地給打開了。</p>
<p>召開了幾次「鎭民代表會」，鎭公所就分頭向各保長發出了「秘密」通知：每保募送二名，每個及齡壯丁必須繳納白米三斗</p>
<p>志願兵！志願兵！在分頭「發動」之後，馮保長就屬意於胡勝祥。</p>
<p>「當兵是最光榮的事，志願兵政府還有獎助。……」馮保長也學會了一派官腔，因爲按理，保長是可以緩役的。</p>
<p>「多少錢？一句話。再嚕噱就是王八！」胡勝祥爽朗地說。</p>
<p>「十五石米，鄰縣只十石。」</p>
<p>胡勝祥扁扁嘴，不層地走開了。</p>
<p>兩天過去，馮保長還是一愁英展；跟胡勝祥接觸了幾次，答允他國幣八十萬。</p>
<p>「志願兵」趕散了小鎭的愷感，「密抽」展期了。小鎭如限送出了十二名，爆竹，紙旗，由鎭公所分送「發動」也熱鬧了一下子。胡勝祥摸摸他的飽滿的袋袋，他似乎有了一個主意，跟一枚爆竹一齊笑出來。</p>
<p>進城了，胡勝祥被安排在新兵集中營。營長高德利接連二天在新兵身上用眼睛搜索了第三天，胡勝祥耐不住了，跑過去，用手拍拍他的肩膀：</p>
<p>「營長好像三年前在這裏領導過打游擊。」胡勝祥巴結地說，沒等高德利接嘴，又連下去：「只是那時候我不在營長手下。」「哦，你？」</p>
<p>「胡勝祥，報吿營長。」老練地：「我來當志願兵咧，營長，我……請你抽支烟，別見笑。」</p>
<p>一疊紙兒，營長高德利看得很淸楚。起初還裝出很不自然的樣子，隨即就鬆出了一陣淺笑。</p>
<p>「總算是老行伍啦。」胡勝祥進一步說：「小意思。哦，營長，開訓還得幾天吧，閒着，總得，總得，動勸腦筋。……」</p>
<p>胡勝祥的話越說越輕，最後把嘴凑近營長高德利微笑的臉。</p>
<p>第二天，集中營有了賭博，是胡勝祥領頭的。…………</p>
<p>在體格復檢正式入營之前，胡勝祥幸運地贏上了近二千萬。對於這筆鉅款，他開始躊躇了。他早有那麽一個假定，如今來啦。「我是爲了什麽來當兵的？」他自問了一句，摸摸那張口袋，他笑了。</p>
<p>「一角四的利息……當兵，才見鬼！」</p>
<p>他磨磨牙，　定了主意。</p>
<p>第四天，醫官來復檢體格，胡勝祥躺在稻堆裏肚痛，叫娘。營長高德利跟醫官說了幾句話，醫官拏聽筒去察騐了一番，點點頭走開了。——新兵開始集訓的一天，胡勝祥滿懷着充份的得意被「淘汰」出來了。</p>
<p>胡勝祥走在街頭有點飄飄然，他彷彿做了一塲大夢，他幾乎是用生命換來了這回夢醒。夢醒了，他想着那大筆的錢，那用危險換來的錢。………他決心用來洗刷掉生命上的汚垢。………嘟嘟嘟</p>
<p>從這個縣到那個縣，汽輪的笛子不爽時地每天劃破這小鎭的寗靜，男女老少從驚異到厭惡。現在，小鎭的居民却常常帶着羨慕的口吻跟在汽笛的後面：</p>
<p>「瞧，胡勝祥闊啦，火輪船的老闆！」（一九四六，一二，二五，深夜，杭州）</p>
<h3>夢外樓詩</h3>
<p>— 徐澄宇</p>
<p>偶上層臺倚夕陽，無邊烟柳正芒芒，龍蟠勢盡寒山在，牛首名存舊闕荒。幷畔孤蛩思後主，　中明鏡笑前梁；誰知才調縱横日，又見着公下武昌。</p>

<p>倦矣猶登最上棋，誰知樓外盡荒丘；連雲冠蓋槐宮夢，依水桑麻栗里愁；饑蟻觸鬚騰戰伐，哀蛩振羽委浮休；那堪更展淸秋節，獨向寒空一駐眸。</p>
<h3>巴黎聖母院　（鋼筆畫）</h3>
<p>— Meryon</p>
<h3>西子湖—桐窗雜憶</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>「欲把西湖比西子，淡粧濃抹總相宜」，這就是西湖之所以爲西湖了。但西湖，只好把它當做一個小公園來看，如果想在這裏得到一些崇高，偉大的情緒，是會失望的。西湖好像是一個美人，而不是英雄。我到西湖去了兩閃，第一次是春天八九點鐘，在湖岸上趁船，望見靑山和垂柳的確如醉如痴。西湖的水，淸而且淺。坐在划子上看一圈的景色，實在像離開了人間。在船上，可以看見水裏的魚蝦蘋藻，日光的波紋射在湖底，像皺紗的紋露。湖底的泥俗稱「香灰泥」，這是說明那泥的細而且鬆，如果人掉下去，實在會愈陷愈深，以至於沒頂，所以，決不能以爲湖水很淺而不會淹死人。划子在湖面上浮過，水被船頭衝開，成兩條水紋箭頭式向後面拖去，叧一條波紋是舟子的獎打出來的。小划子很多，這些波紋也很多，縱横錯雜在湖面上蛇似的蜿蜒，是賞心悅目的光景。四圍山色的倒影垂在湖心，也是動人的畫面，像東西擱在玻璃上，實相和假相，沒有區別，倒過來看也一樣，人如果平躺在地上，來看這上下一般的景紋，會疑心走到玻璃裏來了。傍晚在杭州湖岸上望西湖全景的側面，也有特殊滋味，夕陽染紅了山後的天，映紅了湖裏的水，這上面有一條綠色的帶，是水上的波紋，炊烟從球似的叢樹後面飄起來了，無數廟裹的鐘聲響起來了。</p>
<p>細雨濛濛中，在柳蔭下茅舍中，喝紹興酒，或者在水邊釣魚，很有隱逸的童味。到廟裘去和和尙談天，會羨慕出家人享盡了淸福。和女朋友在蘇堤白堤上散步，會想起才子佳人的故事，看農夫穿了簑衣在雨地裏走，感到「南宗畫」的雅味。到僧廟裏去吃毛竹筍和大芥菜，淸香的野味使你想做和尙。到杏花村去吃醉蝦和　魚，就想做幾首歪詩。至於到靈隱寺，岳王墳，蘇小墓，孤山，秋瑾，徐錫麟，武松的墳墓，想起許多性質不同，都已作古的人來。但西糊後來給近代文明破壞了。第二次我再到西湖，看見山上都造了洋房子，湖堤上走着汽車湖面上駛着汽艇，這是摹做西洋，可是西湖的樹木，花草，村舍，是道地中國的姿態，因此西湖，看起來不像從前那樣美了，西子變成學時髦的女子了，而最可惜的是，南屛山上的雷峰塔已經倒坍，那使西湖减色不少，要不是雷峰塔被夕陽照着，那麼紅地立在山上，是多好看呢？</p>
<h3>北國風沙一桐窗雜憶</h3>
<p>— 前人</p>
<p>為什麽中國北方的風沙是那麼厲害，而過黃河幾百里地，就沒有風沙了呢？是蒙古的沙漠的風，刮到這裏就止了嗎？土質也奇怪極，過了長江幾百里地，就是沙質的土地了。長城外面的風沙，不用提了。北平也有「無風三尺土，有雨一街泥」的俗語。塵土終年拂在人的身上，是應該的。所以，「撣子」這種用具，北方家家戶戶有，假使南方人一樣，用鷄毛帚子，實在不够味。人到天津，北平，走了火車，會有人拿「撣子」給你揮衣服，拍拍幾下，嚇了你一跳，而後向你要錢。這是一種乞討的方法，比僅說吉利話的乞丐，倒實在賣了些實力。這也可見北方的沙灰，有時時除去的必要。實在，人從街上走回來，臉上，身上，蒙着沙土了。而沙土最厲害的地方是開封，每年春天，是刮「黄風」的時候，風捲着沙，掩蓋了天空，塞滿了街市，日色無光，人在沙土中掙扎了。這些日子，人早晨醒來，會看見他已經被埋在沙裘，被子上，桌子上，蒙上很厚的沙土了。食物中帶些沙土，是沒法子除去的，沙就是空氣，空氣就是沙，空氣無孔不入，有什麼法子呢？</p>
<p>這沙是黄河裏的淤沙，被太陽晒乾了，被風刮着，向城裏不斷地吹來的。沙着地吹來，被城牆擋住，沙都積在城外，開封城外的沙丘，和城牆一般高，人要出城，很不必走城門，如果有人攻開封，是不攻自破的地方。其實，開封在眾事上沒有價値，因爲不能據守，徐州鄭州有了問題，開封的一切也早已解決了。所以，除了風沙，開封倒不是常經殺戳的地方。（三十五年十二月於四川樂山）</p>

<p>新寓言</p>
<h3>金木水火土</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>時間：丁亥元且</p>
<p>地點：武定路</p>
<p>人物：金，木，水，火，土。</p>
<p>序曲—歲次丁亥，金旺火盛，鑼鼓喧天聲中，黃金飛黃騰達，人心思「黃」。水亦不甘後人，天空陰霾密雨，一片昏天黑地。「木」躍躍思動，爲「火」所乘；煞時間「木」屋內冒出白烟，難爲了一片「乾凈」土，寸金地。</p>
<p>幕啓時，人聲嘈雜，火烟徐徐冒起，霪雨毛毛，爲「火」加油。</p>
<p>土木兩氏，燻得週身焦灼，運忙打個電話給水大哥：「喂，不得了啦！火大哥有意解決我們，請做好事，快來援救！此刻救星，非您莫屬」！</p>
<p>不要「打棚」</p>
<p>水，懶洋洋地，拿起了話筒：「喂，不要「打棚」好吧？人家過年初一呢」！</p>
<p>土：一無論如何，萬懇帮忙！一切我肚里有數」！</p>
<p>水：「什麼有數，空口白話，不是生意經！大年初一，別多嚕囌」！</p>
<p>木：「喂：萬事莫如救火急！一切過後再談如何？不得了，了不得，火花四處飛，慘啊！救命呀」！</p>
<p>水：「不要嘩啦曄啦！舊的不毁，新的不來。……大年初一，兄弟沒有空」！</p>
<p>一片救火聲中，向水大哥求救的電話，紛至沓來，由是他老人家又有意無意地雙手拿起了兩個話筒：</p>
<p>「什麽，在那里？什麼時候起火？爲何起火？姓什麼，叫什麼，門牌幾號」？……他一面和水氏弟兄們霎霎眼，一切妙計，盡在不言中。</p>
<p>烈燄飛騰，紅光四射；「火」笑了，「水」也笑了，一陣哈哈聲。</p>
<p>新春發財</p>
<p>凛凛威風，叫聲震地，水氏弟兄終於戎裝而至。領班的，迎忙與火神道賀新春發財後，連道：「不要緊！不要緊」！</p>
<p>來得不早不遲</p>
<p>水火略事寒喧後，火說：「老兄來得不早不遲，眞是恰到好處！別急，我正爲你們開出一條火路，這洋房不必拆，隔壁人家藏着「金」大哥，請他老人家出來說一句話，不就什麽都得啦」！</p>
<p>「是啊！對啊！大年初一，咱們道吃西北風長大的」？</p>
<p>金：（鎭定得意地）—「好，金八老爺在此，弟兄們酌辦吧」！</p>
<p>火向右面衝水往左面跑</p>
<p>千呼萬喚，不如「金八」一句話。水終於從皮帶中，牛步而出了。烈焰水花，相映成趣，水向天上噴，火向左右飛；接着，火向右面衝，水往左邊跑，澆呀，澆呀，澆得箱翻篋倒，百寳生翼，水到渠成，只見金物細軟，一切統統得救。</p>
<p>燒呀，燒呀，燒了十三鐘點，澆呀，澆呀，澆得滿載而歸！救　呀，救呀救得一片焦土！</p>
<h3>我們關切市府交響樂團！</h3>
<p>— 酉廷</p>
<p>我們反對解散！</p>
<p>久不聞上海市府交嚮樂團的聲音了。</p>
<p>陰曆年關以前，樂團曾經醞釀過「臘月薪給」問題，隨後就是「解散」了，「私人接辦」了等等的傳聞，同時，蘭心的例行演奏，也停頓下來。滬使珍惜上海音樂前途的我們，非常苦悶！</p>
<p>單就樂團所擁有的音樂圖書及曲譜而言（若干已經絕版）這一歷史逾六十載的中國唯一完備的交響樂團，實不容讓它陷于目前的狀態中。很慚愧地，這一份藝術財產，原是過去洋人經營的成績；我們接收回來，竟不能好好地運用。在梅百器時代，人家什麼都井井有條，經常地演奏着。雖然有人駡過，這批洋樂師待遇太優裕，但是梅百器自任指揮兼主任的時候，由於樂師們生活的安定，技藝日精，水準日高，對於我們的音樂文化，其功勞不可抹煞。</p>
<p>勿浪費機會</p>
<p>樂師們大都很老了，他們的經騐是右貴的，但人生是短促的，大部份樂師，行將達於吿休的年齡；故在樂團收回我們主辦的今日，第一件要務是利用這一可貴的基礎，不斷加進新生的中國演奏者，慢慢地使中國有一個中國人的交響樂團在上海。過去，租界時代，這一份藝術財產，由中國人出錢，由外國人堂權，是最可遺憾的，現在旣已收回，在文化上，不應浪費這一好機會，在國際觀感上，不應「坍台」！（脫離了外人的管理，便弄不好。）</p>
<p>當然，一切都爲了經費！但過去，市府每月不過貼二千萬元，演奏的收入解入市庫，不能謂得不償失！現在，爲了提高樂師待遇，每月預算要市府貼五千萬元。我想也還是値得的！只要不是管理失當，賬目不淸，政府對於這一筆文化投資，應該眼睛看遠一些！</p>
<p>這批樂師們，大多可以敎敎課，收收學生，不一定要靠樂團的職業爲職業的，因此，對於他們的待遇，不能太低；太低了，他們可能散人殆盡。何況音樂這玩意兒，生活太不安定了，便不能專心。梅百器時代，他們每　練習五次，我們　辦後，只有二三次，現在則不必說了。平心而論，他們也太苦了，每月只有卅萬元左右的薪給，除了馬戈林斯基（現任指揮），阿特勒（首席提琴）等首流角色，因兼課鐘點多，爲私人樂會伴奏忙，收入頗好以外，大部份的樂師，都還是終日勸於練習，不兼別職，而當局者却不能給他們以較安定的生活。</p>
<p>惶恐與焦灼</p>
<p>我方接辦以後，唯一好現象是：中國演奏員增多了，中國德衆也增多了，但曾幾何時，交響樂團竟有行將解散之說。這消息，對於飢渴於音樂藝術的我們，實不勝其愷恐與魚灼！</p>
<p>當市庫空盧，財政支絀的今日，我們不敢以交響樂團來小題大做，但由於一份天眞的珍惜藝術珍惜人才的心理，我們有理由請求政府：給我們以文明國家人民應有的權利——正當的音樂！</p>
<h3>當心日人老噱頭！</h3>
<p>— 華民</p>
<p>在報上看到我國對日輸出，仍將以鹽爲大宗一則，使我感到萬分恐怖。因爲據報載：我國去年輸日食鹽達三十萬噸，而日人除食用外，並將以製造成碱。</p>
<p>我們知道鹽是氮和鈉的化合物，把它電解，就可得到氮和金屬鈉，碱不過是電解過程中的副產品而已。鈉是很貴的金屬，氮使可製成那可怖的殺人利器氮氣彈。我們該不致這樣健忘吧，敵人曾利用它來屠戮我們忠勇的將士和無辜的人民。提起了它人人都會寒阻的。現在國際上雖已禁用，然而在工業上，氯依舊很有用。它有殺菌消毒的功用，它就是漂白粉中的主要成分。現在日本將廉價的原料—鹽，從我國收買了去；而將以製成高貴的工業成品，運來我國銷售。利權外溢，是不容忽視的！</p>
<p>戰前日本吸取我國金錢的方法，就是利用「原料中國，工業日本」的原則。他把我國的棉花運了去，織成了布再售給我國，弄得我國民窮財竭。現在他又在玩這套把戲了，希望大家留意，不要被他所欺，同時希望我們的大人先生們，也不要太「寬大爲懷」，太「大國民風度」才好。去年三十萬噸已被騙去了，難道一年年讓他欺騙下去不成？一個被稱爲「五强之一」的大國被一個戰敗了的三等國所欺，似乎太笑話了。</p>

<h3>市府交嚮樂團簡史</h3>
<p>— 索英</p>
<p>市府交嚮樂團前身爲工部局樂隊，創辦於一八八一年，與上海人有着六十餘載的友誼。其始也，名爲「上海公共樂隊」，由雷末賽首任指揮，樂師多自香港澳門請來，後來又自馬尼刺搜羅了一批人才。一九〇七年，新指揮柏古及歐籍樂師六人同時抵滬，內容逐漸充實。首次歐戰期間，因受時局動　影響，樂隊幾致解體。一九一九年名鋼琴手梅柏器周　過滬，因病滯留，乃被請爲工部局樂隊指揮，梅氏十七歲在維也納受獎，造詣極深；故其廿餘年對於上海交嚮樂隊的貢獻，爲滬人所共睹。梅不幸於去年八月三日在滬病逝，今日上海樂壇，莫不歎息無人可與梅柏器的修養比擬，他的死對今日上海這一交嚮樂團，乃爲無可補償的損失！</p>
<p>淪陷時間，樂隊曾被迫改名，勝利後由市府接收，主任一職，由華人擔任，但因經費困難，樂師生活不可與租界時代同日而語。現任主任爲華僑許綿淸，指揮馬戈林斯　。</p>

<h3>李玉茹無處安居</h3>
<p>— 石人</p>
<p>劇　寳塔姑娘李玉茹這幾天忙着找房子搬家，原住的九福里房子是屬於天蟾舞台的，李在黃金唱歲，住的問題早就該由黃金給她解決，可是不知道是因爲九福里的房子太舒服呢，還是黄金戲院不管李小姐的住宿？直到現在還沒有搬。天蟾舞台因爲要把那間屋子給瑛二庚住。限令玉茹在三天內非讓出不可。玉茹當然沒有賴在那兒的理由，可是于時又找不到合適的住處，這幾天可眞把她急壞了。</p>
<p>童芷苓在農歷元且起出演於南京中央大舞台，貼演紅樓二尤，盤絲洞等荀派本戲頗能叫座。芷苓上决去南京演戲住在中央飯店，那是南京旅館中設備最好的一家。不知是什麼意思這次她即被招待到一家叫百樂公寓小客棧裏去住，那家小客棧就在中央大舞台左邊的一條滿地都是汚水泥漿的狹弄中，是一所二層樓的老式建築物，裹面用板壁隔成一間一問鴿　式的小屋子。我們這位漂亮的童小姐便住在樓下一進門的地方的一問十二號房間裏，　化了個名中叫做梁文英，不知道是怕人知道呢，還是別有用意？</p>
<p>百代公司請余派鬚生陳大濩灌唱片，正在積極接洽中，百代方面擬以二千萬元之代價要求陳伶灌唱唱片十二面，並指定灌唱全本「沙橋餞別」及「大保國」二劇。而陳祗允灌六面，且不允灌全齣，結果如何，當在商榷中。</p>
<h3>影院的德政</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>影　從今天起，電影院票價都减低約一成左右，雖說所减無幾，當此百物高漲聲中，未始不是「德政」。其實影庭業及製片商也並不吃虧，因爲娛業損也相應减低了。</p>
<p>同樣一張影片，觀衆往往願黨在甲影院看，而不願到乙影院看。其間實有若干至理。電影院裏的環境，空氣，情調以至於銀幕，光綫，配音也影饗着那幾十分鐘內身心的享受，自然也應該是個重要的因素。事實上，這全在於影院當局的管理問題，要不了他　多少錢　，在後果上，分野却大了。譬如說「大華」吧，走到裏面，覺得怪燠曖的，跟春天一樣。現在煤價如此之貴，你總以爲「耗資葚鉅」了吧，其實每天却不遇甩了九元美金的燃料費。因此事情只在做與不做，辦法還是有的。凡事無不可作如是觀。</p>
<h3>交響樂團「解散」？</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>樂　市府交響樂團因經費問題，停頓演生已久，近日又盛傳主任將易人（傳將由音專戴校長粹倫　）及行將解散之說，記者昨訪該團，據說並不解散，新預算（每月五千萬元）正核請市長決定中，新預算如可批准，則樂師待遇每人可提高至每月五六十萬，指揮者百萬。該團鑒於外間傳聞紛紜，原決定明日勉强演奏室內業一次，但據昨晚消息，是項演奏又因指揮者抱恙，再吿展期。可見樂團問題，尙頗複雜。</p>
<p>無論如何，倘不幸樂團解散或者長期停頓，都將是上海藝術界極其不幸的事件！</p>

<h3>The 36th Annual Budget Passed by the Legislative Yuan in a Plenary Session; Review Opinions Compiled and Submitted to the National Government</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] The central government's annual revenue and expenditure budget for the 36th year, after careful and thorough review by the Legislative Yuan, was passed this morning at the 313th meeting of the Yuan. The proposal and the Legislative Yuan's suggestions and review opinions will be compiled and submitted to the National Government. (The full text of the review opinions will follow.) The Legislative Yuan's meeting this morning was chaired by President Sun. The heads of the various agencies were not present, and only the review opinions of the joint review committee of the five committees were considered, along with the responses made by the heads of agencies during the inquiries on the 30th, and a careful study of the revenue and expenditure was conducted. Regarding the expenditure section, especially the elimination of redundant organizations to save public funds, the legislators had valuable suggestions. How to make up for the revenue and expenditure deficit was also given special attention during the review. The legislators hoped that the Executive Yuan could submit concrete plans to stabilize commodity prices and the implementation plans of various agencies for this year to the Legislative Yuan for review. The entire case was reviewed and passed at around 11 o'clock.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Legislative Yuan issued the following review opinions on the central government's annual revenue and expenditure budget for the 36th year of the Republic of China: Review opinions of the Legislative Yuan on the central government's annual revenue and expenditure budget for the 36th year of the Republic of China:</p>
<p>(1) Revenue Section: (1) The profit income listed by various national banks and other banks with government shares under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance should be appropriately increased again. (2) The profit income of the China Textile Corporation under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has increased excessively. The internal organization and personnel of the company should be strictly adjusted to reduce expenses. It should not continue to raise yarn prices repeatedly as before, which stimulates general commodity prices. (3) The rental income from the received enemy and puppet properties is listed as the same as last year. Given the increase in commodity prices this year, it should be appropriately increased. (4) Detailed information on the sale prices of gold and foreign exchange, US military surplus materials, and received enemy and puppet property materials should be compiled separately in written reports and submitted to the Yuan for reference. (5) All foreign debts borrowed in the 36th year, the actual receipt and allocation amounts, should be converted into national currency and included in the general budget. (6) The amount of Japanese reparations is huge. The possible income of reparations and materials for this year should be priced and included in the revenue section to make up for the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Redundant Organizations Should Be Eliminated; Draft a Plan to Stabilize Commodity Prices</p>
<p>(2) Expenditure Section: (1) The Central Design Bureau, the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee, and the Work Competition Promotion Committee, which are listed under the expenditure for the exercise of political power, are all redundant organizations and should be eliminated. (2) The Supreme Economic Council, the Import Design Specialized Committee, the Import Management Office, and other organizations listed under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan have no legal basis for their organization and should be eliminated. Their businesses should be assigned to the competent authorities. (3) The organization of the Ministry of National Defense is too large and duplicated, and should be adjusted and simplified again to reduce waste and increase efficiency.

Moreover, recent Executive Yuan meetings and previous general meetings of this council have advocated for a liquidation of the commission's business. At this moment, in order to dispel public doubts and maintain the government's credibility, the investigation work can no longer be delayed."

<h3>Various Organizations in the Capital Send Telegrams: Support the Government's Statement, Hoping the Communists Repent and Stop the Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] More than ten public organizations in Nanjing, including the Municipal Council, Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, General Labor Union, Women's Association, Journalists Association, and Banking Association, have expressed their support for the Nationalist Government's statement regarding the CCP's rejection of peace talks. A telegram to the people of the whole country stated: "Central News Agency forwards to all newspapers nationwide and to the public of the whole country: More than a year has passed since the victory, but the war has not ceased. The Communist Party harbors malicious intentions, attempting to seize territory by force to satisfy its partisan desires. Our government, with forbearance and concern for the country, deeply knows that construction must be based on peace and national unity. For a year, the government has worked tirelessly, engaging in peaceful negotiations with the Communist Party, and has not hesitated to seek the realization of peaceful reunification in various ways. Allied General Marshall also traveled across the ocean at his own expense to mediate fairly. At that time, all parties unanimously agreed on the program for peaceful national construction, and the Communist Party also agreed to and signed the plan for troop reorganization. Even the fundamental law of the country had long been agreed upon in principle by the Political Consultative Conference. However, the Communist Party went back on its word, repeatedly breaking the armistice agreement known to the world, and constantly attacked the National Army, using peace talks to cover up its military and political conspiracies. When the war was unfavorable, it pretended to seek peace, and when its aggression was slightly expanded, it used the destruction of the constitution and the restoration of the military situation before January 13th of last year as bargaining chips to force concessions, eventually openly refusing mediation and closing the door to peace, attempting to subvert the government through military rebellion and plunge our country, which is waiting to be revived, into eternal destruction. This not only affects people's livelihoods and the economy but also harms the international standing. Reading the government's statement on the Communist Party's rejection of peace, we can see the government authorities' eagerness for peace and their painstaking efforts with forbearance. However, the Communist Party has become increasingly egregious, not hesitating to isolate itself from the people of the country, launching an all-out offensive to harm the country and the people, and destroying the hard-won fruits of victory in the war of resistance. The facts are all there and cannot be concealed by any sweet words. Our Republic of China is a country shared by all the people of the country, how can the Communist Party occupy it for its own partisan interests? Every inch of land is the territory of the country, how can local separatism be created? Any army should be under the command of the government, how can it be used as a tool for political strife? And the constitution formulated by the National Assembly is the fundamental law jointly discussed and decided by all parties in the country, and it cannot be torn up by the Communist Party alone. We are alarmed and terrified by the overall situation, and we unanimously advocate and telegram our support for the government's policy of peaceful national construction and the realization of democratic rule. We deeply hope that the Communist Party will repent, stop the rebellion, relieve the people from suffering, bring stability to the country, and realize peaceful reunification. Otherwise, if it insists on going its own way, it will be abandoned by the people of the whole country. Other opposition parties should also base their sincerity, deeply understand the government's intentions, and participate in the government to jointly manage and complete the construction of democratic constitutionalism and people's livelihood economy, so that the country and the nation can achieve prosperity, strength, and happiness. We also hope that people at home and abroad will express their consistent views, which will be fortunate for the country and fortunate for the nation.

<h3>Banknotes Stolen En Route from Hong Kong to Guangzhou: Central Bank Representatives Have Confirmed; Boxes Filled with Marble and Women's Clothing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 31st] According to a report in today's newspaper, thirty boxes of cash belonging to the Central Bank, worth 80 million yuan, were found to have been stolen when they arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong yesterday.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] In order to conserve foreign exchange, the government has listed paper as one of the restricted import items, and imports are subject to restrictions. Recently, newspapers in various places have often increased their size to compete with each other. The total amount of paper consumed last year was almost three times the pre-war import volume. If restrictions are not imposed early, the paper shortage will inevitably become more serious. It is learned that the Ministry of Publicity has formulated six temporary measures for reducing the size of newspapers in various places in order to conserve foreign exchange and reduce the paper shortage: (1) Newspapers in Shanghai and Nanjing that originally had more than three large sheets should be reduced to three large sheets, and the rest should be reduced to two and a half sheets, two sheets, and so on. Those that originally had less than two sheets can freely reduce their size. (2) The size of newspapers in other places should be limited to a maximum of two large sheets. Those that originally did not have two large sheets should not increase in size, and those that originally had more than one sheet can freely reduce their size. (3) Supplements may not be published except on National Day and the anniversary of the newspaper's founding. (4) The layout of advertisements and news in each newspaper should be economical in terms of space. (5) Newspapers in various places must begin to reduce their size according to the standards no later than February 16th. (6) The Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior will discuss and formulate restrictions on yellow publications. It is heard that the above temporary measures have been sent to the Newspaper Association in various places for compliance and implementation.</p>

<h3>Editorial: How to Promote Export Trade</h3>
<p>Regarding export trade, it has been reported that the government intends to establish a special agency to actively promote it. Various export industries are very excited about this and propose sending representatives to participate. We believe that whether to participate or not is secondary. However, the importance of this issue is not only something that various export industries should be excited about; other sectors that do not have a direct relationship with exports should also be excited.</p>
<p>The importance of this issue is already very clear from the perspectives of international trade, foreign exchange funds, the development of domestic products, and the maintenance of foreign markets. Furthermore, the current currency has developed to the point where banknotes with denominations of five thousand or ten thousand yuan are not enough for circulation. Most of the overseas remittances from overseas Chinese have overflowed to other areas, and the future of the so-called $500 million loan is uncertain. Although the settlement of foreign exchange for imported goods has been strictly reviewed repeatedly, according to the statistics compiled by the customs, the situation of monthly trade deficits has not fundamentally changed. Based on this reasoning, whether export trade can be developed is an overall national economic issue, not just a matter of the interests of exporters.</p>
<p>How the association will be organized and what its responsibilities will be have not yet been formally announced. We believe that this matter is indeed of great importance and would like to offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>1. The association should not only have an advisory nature. Now is the time for action, not discussion. Too much discussion and too little success will not satisfy the expectations of the general public. Therefore, the nature of the association should emphasize implementation, not just discussion.</p>
<p>2. The association should not only have a general administrative nature. Regarding export trade, in terms of general administration, whether at the central or local level, there is no feeling of inadequacy. If a specialized administrative institution is added, it would merely add some twists and turns and give merchants an additional boss, which would not be of much practical use. Therefore, we believe that an institution of a purely administrative nature is not necessary.</p>
<p>3. The association should not only have a guiding nature. The so-called guidance refers to technical guidance, the provision of information, and conveniences in transportation, insurance, loading, unloading, and remittances. When the export industry is still in its infancy, this type of assistance has considerable value. However, to promote today's export trade, this type of assistance is clearly insufficient.</p>
<p>In summary, the above three points are only supplementary tasks; do not forget the main task. What is the main task? It is to directly take on the task of promoting exports.</p>
<p>Taking examples from other countries, the methods adopted by countries to promote their export trade are no more than the following four types: (1) subsidies, (2) purchases, (3) tax exemptions or reductions, and (4) preferential treatment in foreign exchange or transportation. Now that export taxes have been completely abolished, the third point is not an issue. What to do with the remaining points is worth studying.</p>
<p>If the second point, the purchase policy, is adopted, then points (1) and (4) will not be a problem, and the procedure will be very simple. Moreover, the purchase of raw silk has already been implemented, and it only needs to be expanded to include the main export products. Then, the association will have fulfilled most of its responsibilities. As for other conveniences, there are a few points as follows:</p>
<p>1. The purchase price does not have to be completely bound by foreign market prices, and producers can work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>2. When selling goods, the association has full control over this type of product, which is more conducive to negotiations on terms.</p>
<p>3. There is no possibility of leakage of funds from sales proceeds.</p>
<p>4. Government operation is technically superior to private power.</p>
<p>However, if the above plan is implemented, there are also several creeds that must be observed. First, it cannot be profit-oriented. The purpose of the government in handling exports is to promote sales and provide relief. At least in the current stage, it should be a business with no profit to be made. If this intention is misunderstood and one thinks from a business perspective everywhere, it will have the opposite effect from what is expected, and it is not worth doing. Second, it cannot be exploitation-oriented, that is, when buying, one must take into account the producers' capital costs. Under the dual pressure of high interest rates and stagnant exports, if the state takes the lead and suppresses purchase prices, it may be possible to do it partially in reality and it is easy to please on the books. However, the main purpose of the government's handling of exports this time should be seen by the people. We will not mention ancient sayings such as "storing wealth among the people," but if people in the industry lose too much and become wary, it is not the government's original intention to promote exports. Therefore, if this purchase policy is indeed adopted, we hope that we can consider both sides comprehensively and lay a good foundation for the future of exports.</p>

<h3>Refugees in Northern Jiangsu Eager to Return Home; Relief Work Has Been Transferred to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>Detailed Rules for Land Disposal Determined on the Spot</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong believes that all counties in northern Jiangsu have been recovered, and the center of relief efforts has also been transferred to various counties. If the refugees in exile continue to stay in foreign lands, they will lose the opportunity to return home. Yesterday, he held a warrant and instructed the Zhenjiang Relief Station to inform the post-war relief associations in various counties to inform the refugees to return home by the end of this month.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] As various counties in the Jiangsu Province Pacification Zone are successively recovered, the land issue is the fundamental basis of governance. The provincial government has successively formulated various implementation methods. In order to conform to the provincial situation, it is based on the Central Government's promulgated Guidelines for Governance in the Pacification Zone, Measures for Land Disposal in the Pacification Zone, Measures for the Disposal of Urban Land and Buildings in the Pacification Zone, Implementation Procedures and Funding Standards for Land Disposal Measures in the Pacification Zone, Land Law and its relevant laws and regulations. The Jiangsu Province Pacification Zone Land Disposal Implementation Detailed Rules are comprehensively formulated again. All previous single regulations drafted in this province will be abolished to avoid confusion. The following are excerpts of the main points of the Implementation Detailed Rules passed by the 83rd Provincial Conference: (1) Conduct a universal survey of various situations of land allocation and production, and prepare registers for recording as a basis for promoting land policies. (2) Clear land rights, organize a general clearing of land rights, and issue land ownership certificates to land owners based on the survey and registration results as proof of management. Immediately compile registers of field taxes to coordinate with the collection of field taxes. (3) Register leases. All tenanted land shall be subject to the conclusion of a tenancy contract by both the landlord and the tenant for safekeeping, and shall be reported to the local township office for record. The content of a lease shall specify the rent amount, the time and method of rent payment, etc., and the township office shall prepare a register for recording to control the tenancy relationship. After the implementation of lease registration, if the landlord and tenant cancel the contract or enter into another lease, they shall still apply for registration with the township office and obtain the prescribed lease in order to improve the tenancy relationship and protect tenants. (4) Establish land rights. Based on the results of the universal survey and land rights clearing, determine the ownership of the original land owner and the cultivation rights of the current farmer, and then collect statistics on illegally distributed land, missing landlords, or land that cannot be restored to its original state, and the remaining land relinquished by large landlords, etc., and create a register for government collection. (5) Assess land prices. When collecting the Wang land mentioned in Item 4, the county government shall form a county evaluation committee with one representative each from the county magistrate, county council, agriculture and industry, chamber of commerce, middle peasant branch (sub-branch), court, landlord representative, and tenant representative from each district as members. The land price shall be assessed on a township basis. If the land price difference is too large, it shall be assessed by district. (6) Announce the collection. The land that has been illegally distributed, the landlords who are missing or cannot be restored to their original state, and the land relinquished by large landlords after persuasion shall be collected by the county government in accordance with the law. The price of the land collected shall be compensated with land bonds issued by the China Farmers Bank. The county government shall cooperate with the China Farmers Bank to be responsible for the issuance of land price compensation. (7) Allocate and release. The agricultural land collected shall be claimed by the current farmers at a price. If the current farmers are unwilling to claim it, it shall be preferentially distributed to the original tenants before the disturbances, or to demobilized soldiers and families of soldiers who fought against the Japanese with the ability to cultivate. The land claimed shall be issued a land claim certificate by the county government as proof of management, which will be exchanged for a land ownership certificate in the future. The price to be paid by all claimants shall be paid to the China Farmers Bank in agricultural products or converted into market prices over fifteen years, and the land claim certificate may be mortgaged to the China Farmers Bank. If the claimant neglects cultivation midway or rents out the land, the county government shall take it back and release it again. The land price already paid by the original claimant shall be refunded in full. (8) Guide operations. After the land is allocated and released, assistance shall be given to improve agricultural technology and to establish demonstration farms and cooperative undertakings in order to improve the economic lives of farmers.</p>
<h3>21 Counties East of Wuxi to Receive Agricultural Loans of 40 Billion This Year, Focusing on Silk, Fisheries, and Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 32nd Report] Zhou Hongwen, an agricultural product inspector from the Huifeng Sub-Branch of the China Farmers Bank, answered inquiries from our newspaper reporter in Suzhou on the 31st regarding agricultural loans for this year. The following is a summary: The agricultural loans for this year, which are under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Sub-Branch, include 21 counties east of Wuxi in Jiangsu Province, including Suzhou, Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, Wujiang, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Baoshan, Qingpu, Songjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Nantong, Chongming, Qidong, Haimen, Shanghai County and other places. The preliminary plan is for a total of 40 billion yuan. Suzhou can obtain 2.5 billion. The lending nature focuses on silk, fisheries, and cotton. However, because the amount is extremely large, whether it can be in full amount still depends on the capital situation of the head office. There are already many agricultural loans that are currently being processed. (1) Spring silkworm seed mortgage loans are for silkworm seed farms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The total amount is 2 billion yuan. Each silkworm seed can apply for a loan of 2,000 yuan, with a monthly interest of 0.3%, and the repayment deadline is the end of April. Half of the seed farms in Suzhou Province are concentrated in the Hushu Pass, and they can produce more than 300,000 silkworm seeds, so Suzhou can obtain more than 600 million yuan in loans alone. This loan is not within the quota of 30 billion yuan for silkworm and mulberry loans in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The purpose is purely to maintain the turnover of funds for the seed farms. (2) Various production loans. Before the 40 billion yuan is approved, the Shanghai Branch will temporarily determine that Suzhou will lend 400 million yuan based on last year's quota, which is divided into A. Silkworm farmer loans, including the processes of promoting green feeding, etc., and each silkworm farmer can obtain about 30,000 yuan for raising one silkworm. B. Seed production loans can be loaned 6,000 to 8,000 yuan per sheet based on production costs. C. Water conservancy loans. The head office has recently had a batch of water pumps with diameters of 4 inches, 8 inches, and 12 inches. The Agricultural Bank is preparing to investigate and can purchase them at a price if they meet the needs of rural areas and lend them in kind. D. Fertilizer loans are divided into chemical and soybean cake categories. The quantity is determined by the application of farmers' organizations and approved according to actual needs. E. Fish farming loan. Zhou also stated: "Now that the government's policy on silk has not yet been decided, it is unknown whether the silkworm and mulberry industry should be supported, but farmers have a long history of raising silkworms as a side business, and my country's silk foreign trade also occupies a dominant position in the international market, so the current Agricultural Bank plans to fully support the silkworm and mulberry industry, but the target is not purchasers but silkworm farmers themselves, and without this, it is not enough to talk about reviving silkworm and mulberry. I hope that this year's silkworm farmers in various townships can organize themselves and cooperate to handle the transportation and sale of dry cocoons and silk reeling, so that the Agricultural Bank can issue transportation and sale loans and silk reeling loans as much as possible. I hope that local people of insight will promote it."</p>
<h3>Suzhou and Wujiang Counties to Continue Rationing Rayon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 31st Report] The Suzhou Office of the Central Trust Bureau, under the order of the head office, began to be responsible for handling the allocation of rayon in Suzhou and Wujiang counties in November last year. The procedure is that each silk factory first applies to the office for the quantity required through the union's tabulation, and then the head office approves it before allocating it. The price is based on the Shanghai market price. According to statistics, by the end of December last year, 263 boxes had been allocated and sold. Now, 6,000 boxes of Japanese silk have arrived in January, of which Suzhou can allocate 80 boxes and Wujiang can allocate 60 boxes. In the future, regular allocation can be obtained every month.</p>

<h3>British Government Recalls Ambassador to Warsaw, Sino-British Relations Increasingly Delicate</h3>
<p>British Embassy's Polish Female Employee Arrested Late at Night</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 30th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson announced tonight that Sir Peng Dingke, the British Ambassador to Poland, has been reassigned and will be recalled shortly. The spokesperson did not want to link Peng's recall with Britain's protest against the Polish elections, only stating that Peng had been promoted. It is understood that Peng's transfer is due to the following reasons: (1) During a recent treason case, the defendant confessed that the British Ambassador had received confidential military and political intelligence; (2) During the Polish elections, the government and opposition factions accused each other of murder, and Britain protested to the Polish government twice; (3) It is rumored that Peng Dingke had met with Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, the leader of the defeated Peasant Party, after the elections.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 30th] Sir Peng Dingke, the British Ambassador to Poland, will soon return to his country from Warsaw. It is reported that the Ambassador's announcement of his return came several hours after Mrs. Marynoski, an intelligence assistant at the British Embassy, was arrested late last night. This 50-year-old Polish woman is accused of acting as a liaison between the British Embassy and Polish underground organizations. According to well-informed sources, this arrest is related to the Grocholski case. The British Ambassador has requested an explanation from the Polish Foreign Ministry regarding this matter, but has not yet received a response. According to Mr. Gocz, a spokesperson for the Polish Foreign Ministry, the matter is very serious.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Supports Poland Retaining Current Borders, Becomes Focus of Dispute at Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 30th] Authoritative sources say that when the Foreign Ministers' Conference is held in Moscow in March, the Soviet Union will demand that Poland retain its current borders. Soviet newspapers have recently published articles elaborating on the issues to be discussed at the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference. As the Red Star newspaper stated, the British and American governments have repeatedly attempted to interfere in Poland's internal affairs, intending to revise Poland's borders in favor of Germany. The newspaper then cited the benefits to Poland after the Berlin and Crimea conferences decided to restore Poland's original territory. For example, in terms of national defense, the current German-Polish border is 400 kilometers long, while according to the Treaty of Versailles, it reached 1,900 kilometers. Moreover, the new German-Polish border is defined by rivers, and Poland can obtain three major ports and fourteen minor ports along the coast, giving it broad access to the sea. In terms of territory, Poland has recovered 104,680 square kilometers of land, including Silesia, which possesses vast natural resources. The other recovered lands also make significant contributions to Poland's economic development. The recovered cultivated land will reach over 14.82 million acres, eliminating the concern that land-scarce farmers will have no land to cultivate, and ensuring that every Polish family repatriated from abroad can obtain a considerable amount of land, preventing overcrowding. The newspaper concluded that the Polish people know that if Germany were to reoccupy these lands, Poland would be subject to the capitalistic pressure of Britain, America, and Germany, and the preservation of Poland's independence depends on the development of these new lands.</p>
<h3>China Reiterates Consistent Position on German-Austrian Peace Treaties, Suggests Two Points to the Four Governments</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th dispatch] Regarding the discussion of the German-Austrian peace treaties by the representatives of the four Foreign Ministers, the Chinese government, when invited to express its views, sent notes to the British, American, Soviet, and French governments, reiterating its consistent position that, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the drafting of peace treaties with the European enemy states should be undertaken by the member states that signed the surrender terms in the Council of Foreign Ministers. However, the convening of the peace conference and all procedural issues related to the organization of the conference should be decided in advance through consultation by all five member states of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Regarding the Austrian treaty, it is especially necessary for the five powers to consult, as the Potsdam Resolution did not mention Austria at all. It is reported that the Chinese government proposed: (1) The German-Austrian peace treaties should be formally discussed at a peace conference held by the relevant countries within the United Nations; (2) All procedural issues regarding the convening of the peace conference should be consulted and decided upon by all five countries of the Council of Foreign Ministers. It is also reported that the Chinese government stated that it would submit its views on the substantive aspects of the German and Austrian treaties only after these procedural issues have been agreed upon. Therefore, the Chinese government did not make any statements or suggestions to the conference of the four Foreign Ministers' representatives.</p>
<h3>Austrian Representative States Desires for Peace Treaty, Rejects Southern Territorial Demands</h3>
<p>Czech Representative Presents Opinions on German Issues</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] The four Foreign Ministers' deputies continued their meeting today to discuss Austria's 60-page memorandum. First, the Austrian representative, Foreign Minister Gruber, presented his views, requesting that the Allied powers not impose excessive burdens on Austria, which would hinder its recovery. He stated that the Austrian peace treaty should aim for the following two goals: (1) to confirm Austria's separation from Germany; (2) to avoid imposing excessive burdens on Austria, which would hinder its recovery. Subsequently, the head of the Austrian delegation, Prime Minister Figl, spoke, solemnly confirming, in the name of the Austrian people, the declaration issued in April 1945, announcing Austria's separation from Germany and demanding the restoration of the 1937 borders. He stated that Carinthia was granted to Austria through a referendum as early as 1920, so Austria opposes any foreign demand to acquire Carinthia. Regarding the issue of reparations, Austria was the first to sacrifice under Nazi aggression, so the Allied occupying forces in Austria hope to withdraw as soon as possible. As for the property that Germany seized from Austria, it must be returned to its original owners, and the Allied property in Austria that was damaged in the war should also be the responsibility of Germany.</p>
<p>The four Foreign Ministers' deputies also discussed the German issue this afternoon. The Czech representative stated that the Allied powers must strictly control Germany and station troops in the country until it has been disarmed militarily, economically, and psychologically. The unification of Germany is quite dangerous and could lead to the re-merger of Germany and Austria. In the political aspect, the Czech delegation demanded the cancellation of the Munich Agreement. As for the economic aspect, the Czech Republic demanded the restoration of the pre-war situation so that it could obtain convenience in transportation and communication through Germany and on the Danube, Rhine, and Elbe rivers.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Orders Ban on General Strike, Japanese Labor Community's Pace is Disrupted</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 31st] General MacArthur issued an order at 3:00 PM today prohibiting the nationwide general strike scheduled for February 1. The Ministry of Home Affairs then issued a notice to local officials across the country at 4:00 PM, instructing them to comply with MacArthur's order and ensure public order in the future. MacArthur stated that he took this measure to prevent fatal damage to public welfare. Japanese society today is under the occupation and control of the Allied forces due to its defeat in the war, its cities are devastated, its industries are nearly at a standstill, and the majority of its people are teetering on the brink of starvation. A strike will inevitably disrupt transportation and communication, block the movement of coal, and paralyze industrial activity, which will plunge most Japanese people into disaster, just as a few people drove the Japanese into the devastation of war in the past. This will put the United Nations in a dilemma, forcing it to decide whether to allow the Japanese people to fall into such reckless actions at the hands of a few, or to sacrifice the United Nations' own scarce resources and invest an unlimited amount of food and other necessities into Japan beyond what is necessary to salvage the situation. However, I cannot ask the people of the United Nations to bear this heavy burden. Although I have been forced to take this extraordinary measure, I have no intention of restricting the freedom of action granted to Japanese workers to achieve legitimate goals.</p>

Most strangely, Wang Wanben, who had sworn to heaven to be a witness a few days ago, repeatedly shook his head in response yesterday.</p>
<p>The confrontation between victims and firefighters held in the Municipal Government conference room yesterday afternoon was the climax of the comprehensive investigation and was emotionally charged. According to the head of the police Criminal Division, a total of seven people had been detained for dereliction of duty (none of whom had been handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office as of yesterday). They are: Dai Guangrong (No. 11), Zhu Changhe (No. 17), Cai Zhiying (No. 587), Shang Zhikui (No. 340), Huang Baoqi (Captain of the Jing'an Temple District Squad), Li Xun (District Squad Leader), and Yuan Chengjun (Police Officer No. 108). He stated that Dai Guangrong and Shang Zhikui had confessed to looting during the fire at the police station. However, Zhu Changhe (No. 17) claimed to be a coppersmith and did not participate in outdoor duties, so he suspected that it might be Zhu Changhe (No. 27), whom the victim, Zhou Qifang, had mistaken. However, Zhou Qifang stated that he would definitely not misremember and said that he could identify the person face to face. However, at 9:00 PM last night, when the investigation committee escorted the three suspects detained at the police station to the Municipal Government for Zhou Qifang to identify, they found many errors. He identified Li Xun as No. 17, identified a police officer from the detention center as someone he had seen at the fire scene wearing a flat-topped hat, and claimed not to recognize Zhu Changhe (No. 17). When Li Xun described the rescue efforts, he suddenly burst into tears. He said that he had been ordered to go to the fire scene to clean up the remaining fire and had never entered No. 27. At 6:30 AM on the second day of the new year, he took the No. 49 vehicle back to the district squad and met Police Chief No. 390, who could testify to this. Until 4:00 PM, he was ordered by Section Chief Ye to return to the fire scene. At other times, he remained at the squad headquarters and never left. Police Officer No. 113 could testify for him. At this point, Ke Kexin indicated that District Squad Leader Li and the coppersmith No. 17 had indeed been wrongfully detained and should be released on bail immediately. Inspector General Zhang Da stated that the detention was ordered by the Mayor, so the release of the two also required the Mayor's approval. Because of time constraints yesterday, they could not be released on bail, but it is hoped that they can be released on bail today.</p>
<p>Surging Tides During Questioning</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, the Jing'an Temple District Squad Deputy who drove the first fire truck to arrive at the scene, was immediately announced by Ke Kexin to be removed from his position and investigated after he finished his statement. He said that he was acting on the Mayor's order, as Zhu Qinglan bore the responsibility of overall dispatch and should be investigated immediately. Furthermore, when questioning Zhou Yanbing, the captain of the Yangshupu District Squad, Zhou Qifang jumped up from his seat and pointed out that he had seen the captain climb into the third floor of No. 27 on a fire ladder and had not seen him climb out, fearing that he had left through the neighboring building. Principal Pan also stated that he had seen Captain Zhou at the fire scene, causing the atmosphere at the meeting to become extremely tense. As a result, because no concrete evidence of looting was obtained, Zhu was detained.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang immediately began a thorough investigation after the incident, and officers and team members were questioned in detail. At the end of yesterday's meeting, Ke Kexin asked him to make a public statement, but due to time constraints (yesterday's questioning lasted until 10:00 PM) and the fact that the investigation had not been fully completed, he had to wait a few days. However, he expressed the hope that the case would not be delayed, and that those who violated the law should be dealt with accordingly, and those who deserved to be killed should be killed. Yesterday's meeting also decided to set up opinion boxes at the fire scene starting today, hoping that citizens would provide evidence and opinions as soon as possible. The investigation committee also scheduled to continue interviewing the American military police who assisted in the rescue at the scene at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The seven suspects currently detained at the police detention center, except for Li Xun and Zhu Changhe, who may be released on bail today by order of the Mayor, will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning today. Furthermore, Prosecutor Shen Zushou summoned Wang Yunfu and his family yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Eradicating the Corrupt Elements: The Mayor Expresses His Determination in a Speech</h3>
<p>The questioning began at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Auditorium. In addition to the five members of the investigation committee, those present included Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang, Police Criminal Division Director Zhang Shi, Supervisory Envoy Zhang Quan, Shi Jiliang, and reporters from various newspapers. Thirteen firefighters were summoned. Mayor Wu gave a speech first, briefly stating that the reason why he and Director Xuan attached particular importance to the Seymour Road fire was that they hoped that all firefighters could understand. He deeply believed that most firefighters wanted to do a good job, and that many bad habits during the enemy-puppet period must be eradicated. If there were still cases of extortion and looting among today's firefighters, it would be a disgrace to all civil servants, and the government should investigate and deal with it. He was not treating all firefighters as criminals. He firmly believed that most of them were law-abiding, so those who were attacked by public opinion this time were implicated by a few bad apples. In order to save the reputation of the entire fire department, those who were negligent in their duties must be severely punished, and he believed that this was also everyone's intention. Chinese people often suffer losses and dare not speak up, and it is difficult to find out the truth after the fact. The purpose of organizing the investigation committee was also for this reason, and he hoped that everyone would also automatically report any wrongdoing and not regard the investigation committee as an interrogation organ, but take this opportunity to eradicate the corrupt elements. Before civil servants' salaries can be increased, a special bonus method will be established, and bonuses will be given to those who work particularly hard to encourage them. He hoped that everyone would value themselves, distinguish between right and wrong, and eliminate the bad apples to protect the reputation of the fire department.</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu finished his speech, he left, and the questioning began. The senior firefighters who arrived at the scene left the hall first, and then were questioned separately. Chairman Ge asked the questions, and then Director Zhang, Senator Zhang, and District Chief Hou supplemented them. Newspaper reporters present were also specially allowed to ask questions, but few spoke. During the questioning, the committee members' tone was still tactful, and the main questions were: When did you receive the alarm? When did you arrive at the scene? What was the distribution of water hoses? What was the distribution of work among your subordinates? Which building did you enter? When did you leave? And what was the rescue situation?</p>
<h3>Thirteen Firefighters Summoned: Emphasized That They Had Not Been Negligent in Their Duties</h3>
<p>Those summoned yesterday included Zhu Qinglan, Deputy of the Jing'an Temple District Squad, Huang Zhongxiu, Deputy of the Xinzha District Squad, Zhou Yuehuan, Deputy of the Central Fire Brigade District Squad, Xu Liren, Captain of the Central District, Wang Wentao, Section Chief of the First Section of the Fire Department, Xie Zhiyong, Section Chief of the Mechanical Section of the Fire Department, Xia Guoliang, Chief of the Fire Brigade, Zhou Yanbing, Captain of the Yangshupu District Squad, Qiang Fulin, Captain of the Hongkou District Squad, and Jiang Zhijing, Deputy of the District Squad, Wu Yiyong, Deputy of the Yichang Road District Squad, Li Cheng, Captain of the Jing'an District Squad, Tang Zhiqun, Captain of the Central District Squad, and thirteen others. Summarizing the content of their replies, they all described the situation of diligently fighting the fire upon receiving the alarm, and emphasized that the firefighters had not been negligent in any way. The content of their answers is recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>The First Vehicle to Arrive at the Fire Scene: Zhu Qinglan Describes the Process in Detail</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan (Deputy of the Jing'an Temple District Squad) stated that he received the alarm at 9:48 AM and immediately prepared to depart. The No. 35 fire truck he was riding in had trouble starting due to the cold weather. After starting, the journey was relatively smooth. When the truck passed Seymour Road, it already saw that the fire was very strong. The fire truck stopped at the intersection of Gordon Road and Wuding Road. The most accurate time was about 9:55 AM. It was the first vehicle to arrive at the scene. About four minutes later, the water hose began to spray water. It was directed at No. 425, where the fire started. After about half an hour, the fire was under control. Observing that the fire was spreading towards the rubber factory, he used two hoses to water the rubber factory. One hose watered the Wang family at No. 29, and the other sprayed water at the front of the fire scene. At that time, the Wang family's wooden shed had already been burning. There was a lot of smoke at that time. After dispersing it with the water hose, he saw white smoke from the window and the wind direction suddenly changed, and the fire headed toward No. 29. He immediately led a firefighter, No. 76, and rushed into No. 29 with a hose to put out the fire. He only went to the second floor and then withdrew to direct other workers. Firefighter No. 76 was inside the Wang family's house and only retreated when the roof was about to collapse. He heard him say: "The third floor is really impossible to stand on." As for the reason why the aerial ladder was not used at first, it was because the No. 25 truck did not have this equipment. It was borrowed from the second fire truck of the Xinzha District when it arrived and then used. Furthermore, each firefighter carried a small ax, but he did not see any of them being used.</p>
<h3>Huang Zhongxiu Describes the Process in Detail: Guarantees That He Did Not Enter No. 29</h3>
<p>Huang Zhongxiu (Deputy of the Xinzha District Squad) stated: He does not remember the time of departure clearly, but he only remembers that it was only five or six minutes later than the first alarm. He departed in the No. 33 vehicle and stopped at the intersection of Wuding Road and Seymour Road. He saw that the fire was very strong, and the wooden sheds of five houses had been burned, and the fences had also collapsed. It was extinguished half an hour later. The five or six people following him guaranteed that they did not enter No. 29, but he could not guarantee for others. After the second fire, he met American soldiers who asked: Do you need help? He replied: Yes. The American soldiers broke the glass on the second-floor window with stones to facilitate watering. He stood on the tinplate of the top floor of the Wang family's kitchen, broke the second-floor window with a awl, and watered with a hose. He left the fire scene at 5:00 AM the next morning and was relieved by Zhou Tingbing, the captain of the Yangshupu District Squad.</p>
<h3>Pressing Down on the Hose: Abandoned to Escape</h3>
<p>Zhou Yuehuan (Deputy of the Central District Squad) stated: He received the alarm at 10:55 AM, departed in the No. 38 vehicle, and arrived at the fire scene eight minutes later, stopping on the east side of Jiangning Road. When he arrived, the fire at the rubber factory had not yet been extinguished, and the third floor of the Wang family had collapsed. Nos. 90 and 360 had entered the second floor of the Wang family with him, and Nos. 278 and 348 stayed downstairs. At that time, the lights had been turned off, and he did not see anyone entering or leaving. He only saw several leather belts lying on the ground. Suddenly, the second floor also collapsed, and Nos. 278 and 250 were injured and carried away on the spot. The hose brought in was pressed down and could not be pulled out, so it was abandoned to escape. The leather belt now left in No. 29 is it. He left the fire scene around 5:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<h3>Two American Soldiers Assisted in Watering</h3>
<p>Xu Liren (Captain of the Central District Squad) stated: He received the alarm at 11:15 AM, departed in the No. 31 vehicle, and arrived at the fire scene eight minutes later, stopping at the intersection of Gordon Road and Wuding Road. At that time, it was impossible to enter No. 29. He risked rushing into No. 23, but found that it was too late to save it. He concentrated his efforts on watering No. 21. He broke the lock on the back door of No. 21 with pliers, but he still couldn't save it. He didn't withdraw until the second floor collapsed. He saw two American soldiers helping to water on the third floor, estimating that they entered No. 21 before they did.</p>
<h3>Wang Wentao Said: The House Was Not Good</h3>
<p>Wang Wentao (Section Chief of the First Section of the Fire Department) stated: He arrived at the fire scene at 1:20 AM and focused on watering Nos. 15 and 10. After the incident, he reviewed the main reasons for the spread, because although firewalls were built between the foreign houses, there were wooden frames running through them, and the flames spread through these frames. The history of the construction of the foreign houses was more than forty years, so there were many shortcomings. Modern houses would not cause such a disaster. When the fire was raging, he used three to five flood hoses (i.e., hoses with the greatest water force), and the fire was contained. He left around 5:00 AM after the peak of the fire.</p>
<p>Xie Zhiyong (Section Chief of the Mechanical Section of the Fire Department) stated: His task was not to put out the fire but to pay attention to the vehicles. He notified the communications room to call the central district to move the vehicles, and he personally went to the fire scene to inspect. He only heard the driver of No. 606 say that the No. 30 vehicle was broken. He went to inspect it himself, and the water tank was damaged, but it could not be repaired at the fire scene, but it did not hinder the water spraying work.</p>
<p>Xia Guoliang (Chief of the Fire Brigade) stated: After receiving the alarm, he first dispatched several fire trucks from the Jing'an Temple District, and later, due to the strong fire, he continued to dispatch four vehicles from the Xinzha District. He personally went to the fire scene and tried to cut through the tin roof but failed. He withdrew at 5:00 AM on the 23rd. Afterwards, after reading newspaper articles stating that firefighters had been negligent, he visited Wang Yunfu at the International Hotel as an old friend of twenty years, but Wang denied everything, saying that what was published in the newspapers was not true.</p>
<h3>After Arguing, Zhou Tingbing Finally Admitted That He Had Entered No. 27</h3>
<p>Zhou Tingbing (Captain of the Yangshupu District Squad) said: He received a notice at 4:00 AM on the 23rd and went to the fire scene to take over at about 6:00 AM. He left at 1:00 PM. His task was to put out the remaining fire. He entered Nos. 29, 23, 11, and 5 to put out the fire, but he definitely had not been to No. 27, because there was no remaining fire in No. 27. (After Zhou Qifang, the victim of No. 27, and Pan Wenzhen, the principal of Seymour Road National Primary School, told him that they had witnessed Zhou Tingbing climb into No. 27 on a ladder, and that the fire was at its greatest in No. 27 at that time, Zhou finally admitted, but argued that he could not clearly distinguish the numbers).</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng and Yang Hu Go to Hong Kong Together Yesterday</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng, president of the local association, followed his doctor's advice and took a French postal ship to Hong Kong yesterday to recuperate. He will return to Shanghai as soon as the climate in Shanghai warms up. Furthermore, Yang Hu, chairman of the Seamen's Special Party Department, went to Hong Kong on the same ship as Du to comfort returning seamen and overseas Chinese in the Hong Kong and Macau area.</p>
<h3>Qiang Fulin and Others Describe the Fire Scene</h3>
<p>Qiang Fulin, captain of the Hongkou District Squad, stated: After receiving the report that day, he and Deputy Jiang Zhijing led eleven firefighters in the No. 32 pumper truck at 12:20 PM. After arriving at the fire scene, the truck stopped on Wuding Road, and the leather belt was connected to the No. 2096 hydrant at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Seymour Road. He was ordered by District Squad Leader Li to water the Nos. 3, 5 and two residential houses. Deputy Jiang led the Nos. 198, 335, and 145 three police officers to climb onto the roof on a 55-foot ladder with a hose, intending to pry open the tin roof and water inside. He led the police officers into No. 5, intending to break the ceiling of the three-story building to attack from above and below. However, after reaching the third floor, the room was filled with thick smoke, and at the same time, the fire had spread. He had no choice but to go downstairs. By the time he reached the lower floor, the second floor was also on fire. At that time, the two police officers, Nos. 198 and 145, who were watering on the roof, had their faces burned by the flames coming out of the roof. Under this situation, he had to temporarily evacuate the dangerous area, and used a "flood hose" with other team members at the scene to water in a pincer movement, and only returned to the team at about 5:00 AM the next morning. He then questioned Jiang Zhijing, deputy of the Hongkou District Squad, whose words were largely the same.</p>
<h3>Li Chenglie Said: He Did Not Put Out the Fire</h3>
<p>Li Chenglie, captain of the Jing'an District Squad, stated: He only sent oil to the fire scene from the headquarters to replenish the No. 35 vehicle because he received a report that the No. 35 vehicle was out of oil, and did not participate in putting out the fire. Tang Zhiqun, captain of the Central District Squad, said: Because he received calls from the Nos. 31 and 38 fire trucks requesting to send more vehicles to help, he led thirteen police officers in the No. 46 vehicle to the scene at 12:20 PM, and stopped at the intersection of Xinzha Road, where the district squad leader assigned work, but at that time, the nearby Taiping hydrants had been occupied by those who arrived first, so they could not connect to the water, and only returned to the team at 3:40 AM the next morning. At this point, the questioning was completed.</p>

<h3>Finance Committee of the City Council Holds Ninth Meeting; Municipal Construction Donation for This Year Cancelled After Discussion; Submitted to the Speaker for Review and Transfer to the Budget Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The issue of collecting municipal construction donations for this year has a great impact on the burden of citizens, but it also affects the city's fiscal revenue. Therefore, although this case was discussed once at the Second General Assembly of the City Council, there was no result. The decision made by the General Assembly was "to discuss it again if necessary after the budget revenue and expenditure are determined." Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Finance Committee of the City Council held its ninth meeting. Senators Dong Ganwen, Guo Lingshuang, and Lao Jingxiu proposed, and Shi Yonggeng, Shen Ding, Wang Weiyin, and Gu Baoyu jointly suggested "that the Budget Committee cancel the municipal construction donation for the 36th year, and that the central government allocate funds to subsidize the city government's budget deficit in order to reduce the burden on citizens." After a long discussion, it was decided to cancel the municipal construction donation, and the Budget Committee was notified accordingly.</p>
<h3>Requesting Subsidies from the Central Government Is Like Quenching Thirst With Plums; Director Gu Asks for Further Consideration</h3>
<p>However, according to Director Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau, the case of collecting municipal construction donations for the 36th year was proposed by the Mayor. This tax was set at 30 billion yuan and is a major item in the city's budget revenue. If the collection is cancelled, it will have a major impact and affect the city's finances more than anything else. He must ask for further consideration. Requesting subsidies from the central government is like "quenching thirst with plums." Director Gu also described the experience of requesting subsidies, which was very painful. Since the city's recovery, it has only received 6 billion yuan in allocations from the central government in April last year, and after the promulgation of the newly revised Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, the central government has no obligation to allocate funds again this year. Recently, the central government still wants Shanghai to spend 60 billion yuan, which is even more impossible to meet. In fact, collecting municipal construction donations is not too much of a burden for citizens. The highest amount currently collected is 80 times the housing rental value of the 26th year. If municipal construction donations are not collected, the house tax can be increased according to law, that is, the housing price will be re-evaluated, and the amount collected will be 8,000 times or 10,000 times that of the pre-war period.</p>
<h3>Deputy Speaker Xu Indicates: Taking Into Account Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>At the same time, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing also indicated: In the beginning, most citizens opposed municipal construction donations because they were dissatisfied with the double increase in winter. The difficulty of the city's financial revenue should also be taken into account. If municipal construction donations are not collected, another tax will inevitably be levied, which is actually impossible. How can the missing 30 billion yuan be compensated? Therefore, it is suggested that a decision be postponed and a decision be made after discussing with the Budget Committee.</p>
<p>Finally, the case was decided: "Passed and sent to the Speaker and Deputy Speaker for review and transfer to the Budget Committee. If the budget revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, the General Assembly will discuss ways to raise funds."</p>
<p>However, it was approved that the winter housing tax for the 35th year should still be collected according to the autumn method before the central government's new regulations are promulgated, as requested by the Finance Bureau. As for the evaluation of housing rental value, it will still be based on the standards set by the former Works Department, and only the multiple will be increased.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Restaurant Industry Go to the Meeting to Petition</h3>
<p>Representatives of the restaurant industry association of this city went to the association yesterday afternoon to petition for: (1) Raising the starting point for the banquet tax from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. (2) Reducing the banquet tax from 15% to 10%. (3) Allowing restaurants with music and dance facilities but without dancers and commercial operations to be taxed according to the banquet tax instead of the entertainment tax. (4) Please exempt the banquet tax for noodle shops. Senator Wang Weiyin met and replied: The subcommittee is not in a position to overturn the resolutions of the general assembly and can only submit the various points of the petition to the general assembly for consideration and public decision.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Ordinances: Sent to the Meeting for Review</h3>
<p>Regulations Committee Resolution</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Regulations Committee of the City Council held its ninth meeting at the council yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The resolutions included: (1) Informing the Municipal Government to revise the various ordinances before submitting them to the council for review. (2) Notifying the Director of the Health Bureau and the Barber Industry Association to send representatives to the next meeting to explain the regulations for barber shops, so that they can be reviewed. Similarly, please also send representatives from the city's Slaughtering Industry Association and Fresh Pig Stall Association to explain so that relevant regulations can be reviewed.</p>

<h3>Blood Transfusion King: Has Been in This Business for Thirteen Years, Supplying More Than 30,000 CC of Blood</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Ali Che Jacobi is a Jewish man who specializes in blood transfusions. In his thirteen years of blood transfusion history, he has transfused 36,000 cubic centimeters of blood, truly making him a blood transfusion king.</p>
<p>A few days ago, he transfused blood for a Russian patient in the Sacred Heart Hospital, which was his ninety-sixth blood transfusion. He is now resting at home.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last month, he transfused blood twice in half an hour and did not feel any adverse reactions, only needing nutritious food.</p>
<p>In 1929, Jacobi transfused blood for the first time in Berlin to save his father. But his father eventually died despite the efforts. However, since then, Macobi has learned that he is blood type O and can transfuse blood for anyone with any blood type. Four years later, he began to work as a blood transfusion for a living.</p>
<p>In 1913, Hitler came to power and ordered a ban on the transfusion of the blood of the Germanic "superman" into the blood of Jews. The Jews in Germany automatically organized a blood transfusion organization. By 1938, Jacobi had transfused blood a total of six times.</p>
<p>However, it was not until Jacobi fled to Shanghai that he made a living solely by blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Jacobi was originally a typesetter in Germany. But in Shanghai, typesetting was not enough to support his family, so he transfused blood for the Chinese Medical Association.</p>
<p>Since March 1941, Jacobi has transfused blood a total of ninety-six times, including patients of various nationalities, as well as Hongen, Gongji, and other hospitals.</p>
<p>Of the ninety-six people, one person had been tortured by the Japanese military police. If it had not been for Macobi's blood transfusion, there would have been no hope of recovery.</p>
<h3>Disputes Arise Over the Dismissal of Workers at the China Merchants Bureau Shipbuilding Repair Plant</h3>
<p>The Second Shipbuilding Repair Plant of the State-owned China Merchants Bureau on Jichang Street in this city dismissed 86 workers from among more than 300 workers yesterday on the grounds of downsizing. The workers were very alarmed upon hearing this and elected seven representatives, including Wu Xinde, to plead with the factory to withdraw the order to no avail, resulting in a dispute. They then went to the Shipbuilding Industry Trade Union in District One to request assistance, and the union has reported the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.</p>
<h3>Dock Workers Dispute Loading Jobs; Military Police Suppress the Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday at around 5 PM, dozens of workers from two groups at the Swire Wharf on the Bund of Jinling East Road engaged in a dispute over jobs, escalating the situation and nearly leading to a brawl. After the Huangpu Police Bureau, Taishan Police Bureau, and the Military Police Corps dispatched patrol cars and sent military police to the scene to suppress the situation, order was restored. It is understood that before the war, loading and unloading at the Swire Wharf was handled by a group of workers led by Zhou Ruisun. During the enemy occupation, the work was contracted to a group of workers led by Chen Yiyu, a compradore for Swire. After the victory, the Executive Yuan issued an official document allowing the two groups to cooperate and share the work. However, on May 18th of last year, the municipal government ordered that only Chen's group could work, causing livelihood problems for Zhou's group. They had petitioned several times without result. Yesterday, they gathered at the wharf intending to participate in the work, which led to the dispute.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Urges Reporting of Business Volume; Fines Will Be Imposed for Late Filing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The deadline for reporting business tax revenue for the autumn of the 35th year of the Republic was previously set by the Finance Bureau as February 5th. As this deadline is rapidly approaching, it is reported that the Finance Bureau has decided to impose fines in accordance with Article 17 of the Business Tax Law on those who fail to report by the deadline, and to directly determine their business tax amount. Taxpayers are not allowed to appeal.</p>
<h3>Flexible Measures for Direct Tax; Application for Account Verification and Reduction Allowed</h3>
<p>The Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has been taken over by Mr. William Tweedie. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to tax revenue in this city, especially the uncollected portion of the Class One profit-seeking professional income tax for the 34th year of the Republic. Mr. Lou is currently discussing collection and closing methods with relevant parties. According to sources from the Tax Affairs Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the previously agreed-upon budget of 20 billion yuan has not yet been fully met, and many households have applied for account verification and reduction due to their inability to bear the burden. These requests should be verified and reduced accordingly. Those who have suffered losses or have not yet resumed business and have not filed returns, resulting in the tax bureau estimating and levying taxes based on capital and being unable to pay, should also be investigated and exempted. The tax bureau may adopt this principle to close the case. Those who do not have the above-mentioned difficulties but delay paying taxes will be severely dealt with according to the law. Furthermore, according to a responsible person at the tax bureau, those whose tax amounts are estimated according to simplified tax collection methods and have not yet been finalized must first pay 40% of the tax amount, and at the same time submit their account books to apply for a review, unless they can prove that they have suffered losses or have not yet operated. Otherwise, they will be transferred to the court for legal punishment. It was also stated that the national treasury year will end on February 10th, and it will be impossible to postpone the taxes for the 34th year of the Republic.</p>
<h3>Hotel Inspections; Improvement Measures</h3>
<p>The military and police authorities in this city have always been very serious about hotel inspections, fearing that unscrupulous individuals may be mixed in. However, ordinary travelers generally find the nighttime inspections disruptive to their sleep, and hope that the military and police authorities will improve the situation. Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiying, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council, jointly sent a letter to Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, yesterday, requesting improvements to the hotel inspections. After receiving the letter, the headquarters replied, stating that the headquarters had already drafted measures to improve hotel inspections and would implement them as soon as Commander Xuan returned from Nanjing and approved them.</p>

<h3>A "Trash" Person with an Evil Mind; Conspires with Accomplices to Extort Colleagues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 8:30 PM on the 20th of last month, five people claiming to be staff members of a certain organization suddenly came to the home of Lu Liansheng at 736 Fanhangdu Road in West Shanghai. They threatened Lu with guns, falsely accusing him of being suspected of instigating murder, and used the excuse of searching for weapons to seize 1.19 million legal tender. Not satisfied, they insisted on demanding five gold bars to settle the matter. After Lu repeatedly pleaded, they agreed to pay another 1 million yuan the next afternoon, but they did not show up. Later, the victim, Lu Liansheng, reported the case to the Jiangning Branch Bureau, which dispatched police to investigate. At 9 PM on the 23rd, the police officers in charge of the case traced the suspects to Room 239 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. There, a person claiming to be surnamed Yu, who worked at a military uniform factory, had rented the room. The officers entered and questioned him, and found suspicious evidence. They kept him under surveillance. Soon, someone from the Daxing Hotel on Hubei Road called the number and asked for Peng Xueliang. Seeing that the name did not match, they took him to the bureau for questioning, and he confessed the truth. According to his confession, his real name was Peng Xueliang, also known as "Trash." He worked at a military uniform factory and conspired with his colleagues Chen Zhiying and Lu Susheng, because Lu's family was wealthy. They colluded with Tang Min, Zhang Bin, Li Wanshan, Lin Jun, and Xu Zhimin, who were employed by a certain organization, and went to Lu's home to extort money. The branch bureau, based on his confession, arrested Xu Zhimin, Chen Zhiying, Lin Jun, and others at their addresses. Tang Min, Zhang Bin, and Li Wanshan are still at large and are currently being pursued.</p>

<h3>Many Disputes Over Pre-War Debts; Ministry of Justice Retrieves Files for Research</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Disputes over pre-war debts and the return of bank deposits have repeatedly occurred, such as the case between Chen Jilin and the Four Banks Savings Society, the racecourse bond case, the case between the Lu brothers and the Juxingcheng Bank regarding the repayment of zero-deposit lump-sum savings, and the case between Shen Haoming and others requesting the Zhongnan Bank to repay silver deposits with silver. The details were reported in this newspaper. In addition to the Juxingcheng case, where the court ordered repayment at 800 times the original amount due to the zero-deposit lump-sum nature of the account, the rest were ordered to be repaid at 1,000 times the original amount. However, after the Four Banks Savings Society and the Juxingcheng Bank appealed to the High Court, the 1,000-fold repayment was reduced to 800-fold, and the 800-fold repayment was reduced to 500-fold. Since this precedent has had a significant impact, the Ministry of Judicial Administration is conducting a thorough study of this issue and recently retrieved all the files and judgments from the Shanghai District Court regarding the case of Shen Haoming and others suing the Zhongnan Bank, requesting that their previous silver dollar deposits be repaid at the price of silver dollars or taels of silver.</p>

<h3>Apprentice Jokingly Pulls Down Pants; Quarrel Over Affection Leads to Fatal Scissors Throw</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Jiang Changle and Jiang Linsheng, apprentices at the Zhenfeng Underwear Factory on Jianguo East Road in this city, were joking and playing around during their free time after work on December 5th of last year. Several other fellow apprentices helped Jiang Linsheng pull down Jiang Changle's pants.

After his fellow apprentices bandaged him, he was sent to Nanyang Hospital the next day, but he died on the 7th due to excessive blood loss.

The defendant, Jiang Changle, testified that he was sixteen years old, born in the year of the Monkey, on December 20th, and confessed to throwing the scissors and accidentally hitting Jiang Linsheng. The public defender argued that the deceased was killed by the defendant's negligent injury, and that the defendant was still a minor, and asked the court to consider leniency in sentencing. The court announced that the verdict would be announced at 2 PM on February 5th, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Mother Greedy and Forces Daughter to Marry; Daughter Hangs Herself in Resentment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yan Wu, a 45-year-old woman from Yancheng, lived in a shantytown on Gonghe Road in Zhabei. She had a son named Guangde, 17, and a daughter named Sanbao, 20, who was beautiful. Because of poverty, Yan relied on washing clothes for a living. He Wenqiang, a 30-year-old soldier from Hubei in the General Logistics Department, often frequented Yan's house to have his clothes washed and developed affection for Sanbao, showing her courtesy. However, Sanbao was not interested in him and sternly refused. He then began to bribe her mother to win her over. Due to her greed, Yan agreed. On the 5th, Wenqiang came to the house and proposed marriage again, but Sanbao refused to comply, angering her mother, brother, and Wenqiang. Unexpectedly, the three of them tied up Sanbao and forced her to comply. Neighbors heard the commotion and came to release her. After suffering this humiliation, Sanbao became depressed. On the 24th, she took advantage of their inattention and hanged herself. Afterwards, her uncle, Wu Hengshun, reported the incident to the Zhabei Branch Bureau, which detained Yan Wu and others for questioning and transferred them to the Garrison Headquarters for further investigation yesterday.</p>

<h3>Verdict in Large-Scale Aerial Drug Trafficking Case; Zhu Qishan, Zhang Mingyuan, and Sun Zhicheng Sentenced to Death; Courtroom Filled with Cries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In September of last year, this city cracked down on a large-scale organized drug trafficking organization. After repeated trials by the District Court, the case against the seventeen defendants concluded on January 28th. The verdict was announced yesterday, with the main culprits Zhu Qishan, Zhang Mingyuan, and Sun Zhicheng each sentenced to death. This is the first death sentence handed down by the District Court this year.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the gallery of the First Criminal Court of the District Court was packed with family members of the defendants. The court was heavily guarded, with officers holding loaded pistols stationed around the perimeter, several times more than usual. Judge Shen Tianbao appeared solemn. After the seventeen defendants entered the courtroom, Judge Shen called their names one by one, and then paused briefly. The entire courtroom was silent, with the audience focusing intently on the court. Judge Shen slowly rose and read the main text of the judgment: "Zhu Qishan, Zhang Mingyuan, and Sun Zhicheng, for transporting drugs, are each sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights for life. Zhang Gengtian, for transporting drugs, is sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for life. Yan Dongfu, for assisting in transporting drugs, is sentenced to six years in prison and deprived of civil rights for six years. Song Zixin, Zhang Yiren, Zhang Li Bingkun, and Li Hongying, for transporting drugs, are each sentenced to twelve years in prison and deprived of civil rights for twelve years. Zhou Da, for selling drugs, is sentenced to twelve years in prison and deprived of civil rights for twelve years. Ma Xiangwu and Lu Xinquan are found not guilty. The public prosecution of Li Dingguo is not accepted (Li has hanged himself in prison). The morphine and gold bars are confiscated." In addition, the Nantong District Court, based on the confession of drug trafficker Su Suiliang, sent a document to the Shanghai District Court, which led to the seizure of Zhu Qishan and his wives for drug trafficking. This portion was also included in the judgment: "The public prosecution of Zhu Qishan is not accepted. Zhu Liu Wenlan (Zhu's wife) is sentenced to eight years in prison for intending to sell and possessing drugs. Zhu Decao (Zhu's wife) is sentenced to five years in prison for intending to sell and possessing drugs. Zhang Wenying (Zhu's niece) and Zhang Jianghou (maid) are found not guilty." The three main culprits' faces changed immediately upon hearing the death sentence, and a commotion erupted in the gallery. The court police and bailiffs shouted to stop them and temporarily restricted the audience's movements to prevent accidents. The convicts were immediately escorted back to the holding cell. The family members left the court, some wailing loudly, others crying out to the heavens. Only a few relatives and friends of Ma Xiangwu and Lu Xinquan stepped forward to shake their hands and congratulate them. The sentenced convicts were then escorted by court police to a jeep ten-wheeled prisoner transport vehicle parked outside the door, and sped towards Shanghai Prison, leaving behind a scene of weeping in the District Court.</p>
<h3>"Filial Son" Discovered During Traitor Trial; Claimed to Have Cut Flesh to Cure Parent, How Could He Recognize a Thief as His Father? Huang Heting and Jin Yuzhen Verdicts to Be Announced on February 7th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Heting, originally a rice merchant, was accused of serving as the head of the First Township of the Zhabei Puppet Autonomous Association, the captain of the Puppet Self-Defense Corps, the head of the Puppet First Joint Bao, the leader of the Puppet Zhabei District Grain Public Sale Office Group, the leader of the Puppet Datong Road Public Air Defense Self-Defense Corps, the leader of the Puppet Ailu Protection Corps, and the leader of the Puppet Youth League Branch. He was said to have frequently interacted with Japanese Navy Marine Corps Captain Naka Moto Gi Saburo and translator Kamidaiichi Yu and to have handled puppet baojia for the enemy, controlled food, and collected fees. He was tried in the High Court yesterday. The defendant argued, "I took up the puppet post because I was elected by the people of Zhabei. I am extremely filial to my mother and have cut flesh to make soup to treat her illness. How could I help the enemy and the puppets do evil?" The court ordered the trial to be concluded, and the verdict was set for February 7th.</p>
<p>In addition, Jin Yuzhen, who originally opened the Hefengchang Department Store on Wuma Road, was accused of knowing the leader of the Japanese Military Police Squad and secretly reporting information about our underground workers. A person named Jin Bohe, also known as Bai Leng and Qian Shujun, was appointed by the Military Statistics Bureau as an investigator in the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau to cover up his work. He was discovered by the defendant and reported to the Japanese Military Police, which led to Jin Bohe's arrest and torture. He was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. The defendant argued: "I am a legitimate businessman and have no dealings with the Japanese Military Police. Jin Bohe fabricated the charges out of spite because I refused to lend him money." The court announced that the trial was concluded because the witness, Jin Bohe, had repeatedly failed to appear, and the verdict was set for February 7th.</p>
<h3>Puppet Diplomat Claims Poverty; Jiang Daquan Awaits Sentencing</h3>

In May of the 33rd year of the Republic, he was introduced by a friend to the Puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a clerk. Later, he was selected to go to the Puppet Consulate in Busan, Korea, as an acting attache. The Puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs stopped issuing funds in the 34th year of the Republic, causing the staff of the Puppet Consulate to live in poverty even before the victory.

<h3>Qian Dagui's Wife Arrives from the Mainland; Requests Separation of Property to Maintain Their Livelihood</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Qian Dagui, the puppet Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, has been sentenced to death by the High Court.

<h3>Electricity Surcharge to be Implemented on the 15th of This Month; Restrictions on Electricity Use Expected to be Lifted from April</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported at a press conference yesterday: Because the Fuel Management Committee increased the price of allocated coal by 42,500 yuan per ton from February 1st, according to the method of coal surcharge on electricity prices, the Shanghai Electric Power Company and other companies were approved to increase the normal price by 42 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and the French Concession Water and Electricity Company was approved to increase the electricity price by 12 yuan per kilowatt-hour, which will be implemented from the meter reading date of February 15th. As a result, the electricity price in the former International Settlement area will increase from 120 yuan to 162 yuan per kilowatt-hour, the electricity price in the Zhabei area will increase from 156 yuan to 198 yuan per kilowatt-hour, the electricity price in the Nanshi and Pudong areas will increase from 150 yuan to 192 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and the electricity price in the former French Concession area will increase from 150 yuan to 162 yuan per kilowatt-hour. Restrictions on electricity use are expected to be lifted by April 1st at the latest. The reason why the surcharge increase is different between the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the French Concession Company is because the French Concession Company's own power generation is entirely oil-fired, and the impact is only on the portion purchased from the Shanghai Electric Power Company. If the price of oil changes in the future and the price per kilowatt-hour is adjusted, the fuel surcharge added by the French Concession Company may be slightly higher than that of other companies.</p>
<p>Director Zhao also stated: For public utilities such as trams and water supply, which use more electricity than other public utilities, this surcharge will not be temporarily applied to avoid simultaneous price increases for trams and water, which would increase the burden on citizens. As for the gas price, which has the most direct relationship with the coal price increase, it will inevitably be adjusted accordingly. The amount to be added per unit is currently being carefully reviewed.</p>
<h3>The Sole Survivor of the China National Aviation Corporation Accident Returns to Shanghai by Special Plane; the Lucky Child is Just Over One Year Old; Parents and Older Brother Perish; Cause of Accident Still Unclear</h3>

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Xiao's family reported Zhang Guanfu to the High Prosecutor's Office.

<h3>Social Services: Fourth Application Period Begins Immediately; Trachoma Prevention Campaign Launched Extensively</h3>
<p>All Teachers, Staff, and Students of Universities and Schools in the City Receive Free Treatment</p>
<p>The "Trachoma Prevention Campaign" jointly organized by this newspaper and the Relief Hospital at 547 Xizang South Road, has been in operation since August 26th of last year. More than 400 people have applied for treatment in the three previous rounds, all of whom were teachers and students of primary and secondary schools. Except for a few who stopped treatment due to long distances or other reasons, the rest have been treated and cured according to the hospital's doctors. However, due to limited spaces, many people have been unable to participate. Now, in order to provide a wide range of free treatment opportunities to young people in school, this newspaper has obtained the consent of Dr. Wang Juerong, director of the hospital, to start the fourth registration period on February 1st. Students and teachers of universities and schools with signs of trachoma should first apply to the social services department of this newspaper for registration. They can then use the voucher to go to the hospital for examination and treatment. Clinic hours are from 2:00 to 5:00 PM daily. The clinic is closed on Sundays. We hope that young students and educators will actively apply and not miss this opportunity!</p>
<p>Acknowledgment of Gift: We recently received from Mr. Chen Shutong a copy of "Records of Communist's Atrocities and Vinlations of the Cease Fire Ordersince January 13, 1946." We hereby express our gratitude. Library of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Admirable Morality: To the Editor: I recently lost my wallet on a Route 1 tram, containing cash, keys, national identification card, and other items. It was picked up by Mr. Feng Chunqi of the Xieli Coal Company on Huangjiaque Road, Xiaoximen, who took the trouble to travel a long distance to return it to me. In this era of moral decay, people like Mr. Feng are rare. What is commendable is that Mr. Feng was motivated entirely by morality and refused to accept any reward, even the tram fare. Therefore, I earnestly request that you publish a few words in your newspaper to let people know that even in Shanghai, which is full of evil, there are still people like Mr. Feng who uphold traditional virtues. With best wishes, Zhang Qigu.</p>

<h3>Little Formal Trading Still Occurs in the Rice Market; Open-Air Transactions Continue; Prices of Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The supply of rice and grain is becoming increasingly scarce, and the market situation remains seemingly loose but actually tight. Only about 1,800 shi of goods arrived in the northern and southern markets combined. There is still little formal trading in the market. Open-air japonica rice prices continue to rise by 3,000-4,000 yuan, while indica rice and Baiyuan and Yinyuan varieties each rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan. The authorities are extremely concerned about this situation, and the Bureau of Social Affairs continues to sell 6,750 bags of allocated rice in the northern and southern markets. Rice merchants are absorbing it well. The bureau has decided to sell 20,000 shi of allocated rice in the northern and southern markets today to suppress the rising trend.</p>
<p>According to Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, the city is not lacking in rice reserves, as all grain warehouses are full, and some have even rented additional storage space. The recent price increase is likely due to the fact that farmers are busy with New Year celebrations, resulting in fewer sources of supply. In addition, stimulated by rising prices, prices in the producing areas are high, and many villagers are taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>There are more than 2,000 rice shops in the city, and demand is also high. Since the opening of the port, the Bureau of Social Affairs has sold a total of 22,550 bags of Saigon rice, including 12,460 bags sold on January 27, 320 bags sold on the 28th, 160 bags sold on the 29th, 2,760 bags sold on the 30th, and 6,850 bags sold yesterday. If necessary, the Bureau of Social Affairs can continue to sell at any time. Chief Ji also told reporters that rice prices are expected to stabilize within the next week.</p>
<p>The Rice Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting yesterday, but no concrete decisions were made. The Rice Dealers Association also held a meeting yesterday, deciding to report the difficulties faced by retail merchants to the authorities and to request the mayor to sell part of the rice collected as agricultural tax in addition to selling Saigon rice in order to stabilize the market.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that a large amount of Siamese and Burmese foreign rice is flowing into China. The first batch of 8,500 tons shipped from Bangkok arrived in Shanghai during the Spring Festival, and the second batch is expected to arrive in the coming days. The authorities have ordered 100,000 tons of foreign rice from Siam and Burma and 140,000 tons of foreign rice from Vietnam and other rice-producing countries.</p>
<p>Sales in Shantou are slightly more active, with raw oil rebounding by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Clear oil and rapeseed oil have little fluctuation. Raw sesame oil also remains unchanged, but small-batch sesame oil also increases by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Soybean oil remains scarce. Soybean cake is moving in Xiamen and Quanzhou but is not strong, but prices of all commodities are rising, with a corresponding increase of 300-400 yuan. Soybean oil factories are aggressively buying soybeans, and the market is fiercely competitive, with prices skyrocketing by 3,000 yuan. Red sorghum has not been seen for a long time, and distilleries are eagerly demanding it, leading to a sharp price increase, soaring by 6,000-7,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Guangdong remain popular, with prices soaring by 7,000-8,000 yuan. Red beans also rise by 4,000-5,000 yuan. Green beans remain firm. Sesame seeds and white sesame seeds continue to rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Yellow sesame is sluggish. Flour is unusually active, rising another 2,000-3,000 yuan. Wheat bran is tight in the morning but relaxes in the afternoon, rising by 300-500 yuan. The prices of all grains are rising wildly.</p>

In the afternoon, the gold market was strong, and No. 63, No. 84, and No. 173 started to rise as soon as they entered the market. Although there was consolidation in the middle, gold prices continued to rise without retreat. No. 180, No. 185, No. 186, No. 145, and others joined in the buying spree, ending at high prices. As a result, Dieyong Yarn, Meiya, Sino, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Huafeng each rose by more than 0.5%, while XinGuang rose less.

However, they eventually hovered around the previous closing price. As a result, the prices of all bonds were similar to those of the previous day. About 1 million yuan was traded.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>Trading in the tea market remained stagnant yesterday. The reason is that holders are hoarding, while buyers are trying to suppress prices, so negotiations are difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion. It is understood that there is currently a considerable demand for Chinese tea in the United Kingdom and French Africa, especially green tea. Unfortunately, due to various reasons, export prospects are not optimistic, and local tea merchants are still working to find a way to revive the industry. However, whether they will succeed is difficult to predict in the short term.</p>

<h3>Market Dominated by Buying Sentiment; Yarn Prices Increase Across the Board; Textile Construction Company Opens 987 Bales</h3>

Other types of yarn also saw activity, resulting in a general increase of 50,000-80,000 yuan for 20-count yarn. Sixteen-count yarn was particularly popular due to frequent searches by towel factories and also rose by 50,000-70,000 yuan. Forty-two-count yarn, due to the supply of Sunlight double-strand thread from the Textile Construction Company, contracted and fell by 20,000-30,000 yuan, a situation contrary to that of 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company opened 987 bales of yarn yesterday, of which 778 bales were for manufacturers and 9 bales were for yarn dealers. All were allocated. There were a total of 600 applicants, of which 4012 were manufacturers and 199 were yarn dealers.</p>

<h3>Production of Flour Impossible Due to Excessively High Costs</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Five major flour mills in the city, Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Maoxin, and Yutong, previously faced difficulties in supplying 12,000 bags of rationed flour per day due to a shortage of raw materials. After consultation, it was agreed to maintain the supply until the end of January. That date expired yesterday. Whether to continue rationing from February is still under consideration by the mills. However, it is understood that the raw material shortage at the mills persists. An executive of one flour mill told reporters that when the foreign exchange was adjusted last autumn, wheat was priced at 15,000 yuan per dan and flour at 13,000 yuan per bag. Currently, wheat in the producing areas has reached 56,600 yuan per dan, while flour is still only 25,000 yuan per bag. The cost is excessively high, making production impossible. Therefore, the five flour mills jointly submitted a petition to Mayor Wu, proposing three solutions: (1) Expedite the import of foreign wheat so that the flour mills can continue production. (2) To maintain the food supply for the people, request the government to quickly allocate foreign flour to supply the market so that the mills can gradually purchase wheat from the producing areas. The flour produced from the new wheat should be priced separately according to the new cost. (3) The prices of wheat and flour in the wheat-producing areas should be linked to those in Shanghai to facilitate the purchase of raw materials and continue production.</p>
<p>Another flour industry giant told reporters that although the current production situation of the major flour mills in the city is extremely difficult, it is estimated that the mills' ability to supply rationed flour will not be a problem in the short term. However, the fundamental solution lies in increasing the supply of raw materials.</p>
<h3>US Demand for Tung Oil Is Very Strong; Guangzhou Exporters Reap Huge Profits</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 30th] Recently, US demand for tung oil has been very strong, and Guangzhou tung oil exporters have been reaping huge profits for several weeks. The US is demanding large quantities of tung oil because of a poor flaxseed harvest last year. Flaxseed oil can be used as a substitute for tung oil. For the past two months, tung oil has been the main export from Guangzhou, other exports being cinnamon, hog bristles, and feathers. Before the war, Guangdong often exported some raw silk, but the silk industry has not yet recovered.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Continues to Be Expensive</h3>

Low-grade Baoshan bituminous fine coal also requires 320,000-340,000 yuan. The import of white coal, foreign coal, Hongji, and Tongdeli lump coal is restricted by the Import Management Committee, which may affect the arrival of goods. The market situation is very strong. Jiaozuo lump coal has reached the 900,000 yuan mark, and Jiaozuo fine coal is following suit, with prices rising to 410,000-440,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Fabric Market Turns Weak; Textile Construction Company Sells 30,000 Bolts</h3>
<p>The market price of dark blue drill cloth has been rising steadily since the end of last year. Because the Textile Construction Company has not supplied high-grade gray cloth for several months, and stocks of fine cloths such as Five Fortunes AAA Color Balls have become depleted, dyeing factories are facing difficulties in production. It is understood that yesterday the Textile Construction Company sold about 30,000 bolts of Longtou fine cloth to dyeing factories at a price of 112,000 yuan. The trading of Longtou fine cloth was gradually seen in the cotton fabric market yesterday, which made it difficult for other low-grade gray cloths to improve. The initial bid for Blue Chicken fine cloth was 100,9750 yuan, but it later retreated to 100,900 yuan. Five Fortunes was 111,000 yuan. There was little change in drill cloth and raw cloth, but light-colored cloths continued to sell well.</p>

<h3>Fuel Management Committee's Coal Will Be Transported by National Ships</h3>
<p>Freight Rate Is 35,000 Yuan Per Ton</p>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee's coal has been transported by foreign ships. Because the contracts of various foreign ships will expire successively before the end of April, new contracts have been signed with the National and Private Shipping Association, totaling 70,000 tons, shared equally by the National and Private sectors.

<h3>Foreign Cotton Already Ordered But Not Settled - The Allocation Committee Finds It Difficult to Handle</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The fourth meeting of the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Import Control Board was held yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Central Bank. The attendees included Chairman Li Gan, Committee Members Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, and attendees Wang Qiyu, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Zhang Silu, and Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Division of the Textile Control Board. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

Regarding the foreign cotton that has been ordered but not settled, in terms of the orders of the factories belonging to the Six-District Cotton Spinning Association, it has reached more than 400,000 bales (of which only about 7,000 bales have been settled). The disposal of this portion of foreign cotton cannot be decided by the Allocation Committee. There were three opinions discussed yesterday: (1) If this batch of foreign cotton is ordered by the importer, it must be transferred to the yarn factory before it is qualified to apply for foreign exchange. (2) It was found that most of this batch of foreign cotton was ordered at high prices, about 40 cents per pound, while the current market price is about 30 cents, whether or not to supply foreign exchange at this price needs to be decided by the Central Bank. (3) If each factory wants to order new goods, they should first purchase this batch of foreign cotton.</p>
<h3>Rayon - Allocation Vouchers Not Received, Holders Take Advantage to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Silk Fabric Merchants Languishing in the Doldrums</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of rayon suddenly rose again in the market, mainly because silk weaving factories have gradually resumed production, but the 20th-period allocation vouchers have not yet been received and cannot be used. Therefore, some factories are absorbing rayon from the black market for emergency supplies, and the holders are taking the opportunity to raise prices. Compared with the previous day, the price increased by more than 150,000 yuan. No. 120 Toyo Rayon was traded at 620,000 yuan in the morning and was quoted at 650,000 yuan in the afternoon.

<h3>China Tanker Company Officially Established Today</h3>

It is jointly established by the China Petroleum Corporation and the China Merchants Bureau, with a total capital of 60 billion yuan. The chairman of the board is Weng Wenhao, and the vice-chairman is Xu Xueyu. Its internal organization is divided into five departments: General Affairs, Business, Navigation, Finance, and Chief Engineer's Office.

<h3>Export of Woven Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Silk Weaving Industry Comes to Shanghai Seeking Equal Treatment - Requesting Allocation of 400 Bundles of Raw Silk and 800 Cases of Rayon</p>
<p>The five agencies of Central, Transportation, China, China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and China Sericulture Corporation have established the Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee to support exports. They will first provide 1,400 bundles of raw silk and 2,400 cases of rayon to the Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Operation Company organized by the silk weaving industry to weave silk fabrics. A contract was signed a few days ago. The Export Guidance Committee now needs to understand whether the weaving machines of the contracting factories are suitable, whether the woven products meet the needs, and what their productivity is. It has decided to first send personnel to various weaving factories to conduct a thorough investigation and then make overall plans and allocate raw materials to each factory to avoid the woven products not meeting market needs. These investigators are being dispatched separately and will depart next week, with a deadline of one week to complete the investigation. There are currently 2,500 weaving machines in various factories under contract. If all of them can be used, the first phase can weave 80,000 bolts of silk fabrics for sale to India, Southeast Asia, and Europe, with a total value of more than 5 million US dollars.</p>

<h3>Zhangjiakou Spring Festival: Continuous Nightly Auspicious Snow Foretells a Bountiful Year</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Jie Zhong</p>
<p>Zhangyuan Air News, 21st</p>
<p>In the hearts of the people, the Gregorian New Year's Day is a "public" holiday, with national flags hung, spring couplets pasted, and meetings held for celebrations, but it is merely a formality for the "public." Only the Spring Festival is considered the true New Year, and one's age is counted from this day. The year's hard work is meant to be compensated and comforted during the New Year. Even families who normally cannot afford meat will eat "dumplings" on this day. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, even the old oxen and horses get a day of rest.</p>
<p>Spring Festival: Quiet and Silent</p>
<p>This year's Spring Festival in Zhangjiakou was spent in quiet silence. Not even the sound of firecrackers could be heard. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the sky was overcast with dense clouds, and snowflakes danced in the air, covering the earth in a silver coat. A few dim and sparse streetlights flickered on the streets. This scene, which was more elaborate and originally arranged for Christmas, appeared more natural and beautiful. However, with the curfew advanced to 6 PM, who was there to appreciate this wonderful scenery?</p>
<p>The Night Before: Guard Posts Everywhere</p>
<p>To raise vigilance and prevent accidents, the military authorities allowed their soldiers to celebrate the New Year as early as the 18th. The troops all ate a meal of "dumplings" for the New Year. On the eve of the Spring Festival, nearly all the soldiers were dispatched, with strict precautions taken, as if facing a formidable enemy. There were few pedestrians on the road, and guard posts were everywhere. Although people felt greatly inconvenienced, what choice did they have for their own safety?</p>
<p>Government Agencies: Four "No's" Campaign</p>
<p>Although government agencies did not explicitly declare a holiday, due to "human sentiment" and "custom," they could not help but have a "regular holiday" of one day to rest. To promote frugality, the relevant authorities initiated a four "no's" campaign: no gift-giving, no New Year's visits, no banquets, and no New Year's money. Leaders of various government agencies also led their subordinates in signing pledges to practice this campaign. It was stipulated that if anyone violated the four "no's," their name would be revealed in the newspaper. This provided ample excuse for many who "cared about face." Originally, it was truly unnecessary for the poor public school teachers, with soaring prices and meager salaries, to "pretend to be wealthy by slapping their faces until they swelled." The ethos and environment of frugality should always be cultivated.</p>
<p>Wounds: Difficult to Heal</p>
<p>The people of Chahar Province recall the past year as a nightmare. The atrocities of the Communist army have left irreparable wounds in the hearts of the people! Cargo transportation is obstructed, commerce is sluggish, industries are bankrupt, and thousands of people are unemployed. Traffic is cut off, and many people cannot return home. Children are abducted, and families cannot reunite. "Purges," "struggles," and harsh and tyrannical levies have pushed the people's lives to the brink of hunger and hardship. The massacre in Chongli and the bloodbath in Longguan—what force can erase these painful and terrifying memories?</p>
<p>New Year: New Hopes</p>
<p>The New Year has arrived, bringing new hopes. On the morning of the Spring Festival, the snow stopped, and the sun tore through the soft curtain, casting gentle sunlight upon the world. The people also showed smiles of hope, putting on their only new clothes—even if it was just a pair of new shoes and a belt. Women applied thick layers of makeup. Although the shops were tightly closed, the streets were bustling and did not seem deserted. Civil servants greeted each other with "Happy New Year!" Merchants still chanted the old tune of "May you prosper upon meeting!"</p>
<p>Auspicious Snow: Fell Continuously Overnight</p>
<p>These past few days, snow has always fallen overnight, perhaps a sign of an auspicious and bountiful year. In the past year, with continuous warfare, the people can no longer withstand natural disasters. Especially those living in the cracks between the Nationalist and Communist armies, the large-scale troop gatherings directly increase the burden on the people. Mutual blockades sever communication, with cities lacking fuel and food, and rural areas lacking cloth and daily necessities. Only today do the people more keenly experience the urgency of "freedom from want and freedom from fear." Everyone eagerly longs for stability and peace. The people can no longer endure the torment of war. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. When their very lives lose protection, one day they will clench their angry fists and turn against the Communist army, which loves war and harms the people.</p>
<p>Provincial Government: Chairman Inaugurated</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi, the chairman of Chahar Province, and the commissioners and directors of various departments were sworn into office on January 15th. Following the Spring Festival, an administrative conference will be convened to discuss this year's policy directions, and how to turn the words on paper into action. Today's Chahar Province is like a declining family heading towards revival, with scenes of devastation everywhere, and hundreds of policies waiting to be implemented. Everything requires swiftness and efficiency. We urge the realization of a new Chahar!</p>
<p>May the misfortunes of the past forever vanish with the passing year! With spring arriving in the world, we hope to bring the gifts of stability and peace to the people, allowing their desolate hearts to receive the warmth of nourishment.</p>
<h3>Southern Country's Spring Rain</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Guangzhou Air News, 25th</p>
<p>Perhaps because the Gregorian calendar has not been promoted for long, and the Lunar calendar, which has been used for thousands of years, has a long and deep history, the Gregorian New Year is never as lively as the Lunar New Year. In Guangzhou, the Gregorian calendar clearly passed very quietly, while the arrival of this Lunar New Year is so lively and intense!</p>
<p>Fine Rain Does Not Diminish the Merriment</p>
<p>Some say: The Gregorian New Year is celebrated by the "officials," while the Lunar New Year is celebrated by the "people." While this may not be entirely true, we cannot help but admit that only the Lunar New Year is a public holiday celebrated by all. Because during these few days, perhaps everyone from officials to commoners will temporarily put down their work and rest a bit! Therefore, with the arrival of the Lunar New Year, shops are closed, schools have already started their winter vacation, and although government agencies do not explicitly declare a holiday, there are at least a few days of "black market leave" for free activities. Even foreign-managed agencies like "UNRRA" and "consulates" are no exception. Therefore, although the heavens were rather disappointing during the Spring Festival days, with continuous drizzle, the streets were still lively. Firecrackers boomed all day long, and people squeezed through the muddy roads. Some of the more prosperous roads were even more packed. These bustling crowds all showed very cheerful expressions. Presumably, everyone had a common hope, which was "may this year be better than the last!"</p>
<p>Astonishing Consumption Amidst the Economic Downturn</p>
<p>During this joyful Spring Festival, what makes the people of Guangzhou most headache is the continuous spring rain, which ruined the plans of those refined individuals for spring outings in the suburbs. And various teahouses and restaurants have already "closed the furnace for the year" and will not reopen until the fourth or seventh day of the Lunar New Year. This has resulted in most of the more than 1.2 million citizens only being able to seek recreation at entertainment venues. Therefore, in these past few days, the city's theaters and dance halls have been truly lively. In total, there are fourteen cinemas in the city, showing five performances day and night, and six Cantonese opera theaters, with two performances day and night. Almost every performance is packed with people, and buying tickets is actually more difficult than receiving relief rice. Then there are the dance halls! During these few days, regardless of whether people can dance or not, they all like to go to the dance halls to join in the fun. Even young women from the countryside are taking this New Year's opportunity to have a good time, and the dance floors are so crowded that one cannot even turn around. Although there are more than thirty dance halls of various sizes, every one of them is equally crowded. The theater and dance hall owners are naturally beaming with joy, and the "waist-bending ladies" are naturally "reaping a great harvest"! Someone has estimated that the entertainment consumption within three days, just for the cinemas, has reached more than 300 million yuan, and the direct and indirect consumption of the more than thirty dance halls is certainly more than this figure. In this economic downturn where all industries are depressed, this huge consumption figure is truly astonishing!</p>
<p>Streetcars Transformed, A New Atmosphere</p>
<p>The streets of Guangzhou have indeed added a lot of new atmosphere with the arrival of the New Year. The most significant change is the public buses, which have been transformed. At the time of the restoration, in order to maintain urban traffic, cargo trucks were used to convert public buses, which was a makeshift solution. These cars were truly unsightly, and after more than a year, most of the cars were badly damaged. Recently, the municipal authorities seem to have made some improvements. Around the Spring Festival, a large number of new-model public buses have been running on the streets, and the routes have also been reorganized starting from Lunar New Year's Eve, so that almost every road has a public bus passing through it, unlike before when they were concentrated in some prosperous areas. This is naturally very reasonable, and the citizens are all praising the convenience. However, there are still some shortcomings, namely that the roads are still as bumpy and uneven as before, and have not been repaired. Even though good cars have been replaced, they are still truly deadly. Especially in these past few days, with the spring rain falling, the roads are full of mud, and mud splashes everywhere the cars pass. Also, these days, the street cleaners are resting for the New Year, resulting in piles of garbage on the roads that no one is cleaning up, and the stench is suffocating. This is truly a blight on the scenery!</p>
<p>All Sectors Promote a Grand Movement</p>
<p>This Spring Festival, all sectors of Guangzhou are actively promoting a grand movement, which is to request that Guangzhou be changed to a special municipality. This matter is closely related to the more than 1.2 million citizens, so this movement is giving everyone great excitement. Originally, Guangzhou meets all the conditions to be changed to a special municipality, but the reason for the long delay is that it is the location of the provincial capital. If Guangzhou is changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan, then the provincial government would have to move, and Guangdong does not have a town equivalent to Zhenjiang in Jiangsu or Chengdu in Sichuan that can serve as a provincial capital, so this problem has been delayed. However, this has greatly hindered Guangzhou's recovery and construction, because Guangzhou is a provincial-level city, and construction funds are extremely stretched. Currently, the city government is unable to undertake tasks such as the reconstruction of school buildings, the repair of roads, the establishment of social relief, local cleaning, and police reorganization, forcing it to levy donations from citizens, which increases the burden on citizens. Therefore, the City Council and dozens of civil organizations have launched this movement to request "change to a special municipality," and jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the first day of the Lunar New Year to make the request, with the following reasons: (1) Guangzhou is the birthplace of the revolution, and the Founding Father had planned it in detail as a special municipality; (2) The population exceeds one million, possessing all the conditions of a special municipality; (3) Geographically, it has been a major town in the South, with direct international transportation and trade, and at the same time, its politics and economy have special circumstances; (4) Cannot due to being the provincial site, and [prevent] other [developments].</p>
<p>As for the provincial government's view on this issue, there has been no expression; the reporter interviewed Civil Affairs Director Li Yangjing, who only answered "everything is handled in accordance with central government laws and regulations." And most recently have gotten news that the City Council's report has already been sent to Chairman Chiang for approval, and may be decided at the same time as the three cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Hankou. Presumably the order will be issued soon, and it will soon be known whether Guangzhou's "change to special" can be realized.</p>
<p>Rain Presents Good Omen, Prices are Rising</p>
<p>According to the Lunar calendar, this year is the year of Dinghai, the year of the Pig. In theory, after this year, all prices will continue to rise. The price of rice has also risen to 80,000 yuan per dan; gold and foreign currency are still soaring. In the three days of the New Year, gold rose to 48,000 to 49,000, and the Hong Kong dollar rose from 1,400 to 1,490. So looking ahead to all prices this year, I am afraid there will only be increases and no decreases, and the degree of difficulty in living this year will not be less than last year! However, there is one thing to be happy about, which is that this year's Spring Festival had ample rainfall. According to the farmers, this is a sign of a bountiful year.</p>
<h3>New Year's Day Tragedy: "Public Display" in Taiyuan</h3>
<p>— Li Bi</p>
<p>Santuo Taiyuan Air News</p>
<p>Strive to bid farewell to the old year, revive and welcome the new year. New Year's Day, in Shanxi, is said to be the day the revival work begins. In the country, it is said to be the time to promulgate the constitution. Therefore, with a happy mood, the reporter browsed the narrow streets for a week. Although the north wind was blowing, I did not feel cold. This may be because I was too excited. Colorful wall newspapers and red and green slogans were everywhere. Beautiful national flags fluttered in front of every household. On the glass windows of shops, one could see red paper strips that read: "Celebrating New Year's Day, prices reduced for three days." At the entrances of theaters, posters were also put up that read: "Celebrating the promulgation of the Constitution, half-price tickets for three days." Amidst this celebration, tragedies occurred one after another. What is strange is that one scene happened each day, and they were well coordinated. The first scene was the beheading for public display, the second scene was a car accident, and the third scene was a rape and murder case. Among them, the most sensational was the first case. The details of the situation are reported below:</p>
<p>Head Severed from Body, Fresh Blood Flowing</p>
<p>At about 10 PM on New Year's Day, when the reporter was returning home from the cinema, when I reached the most lively place in Taiyuan—the south entrance of Liuxiang, I suddenly saw several armed sentries standing there. Moreover, they were strictly prohibiting passage. In fact, a huge crowd had gathered, and it was impossible to walk past. I only heard people say: "This person is really unlucky. Instead of having a good New Year, he had to go to a brothel. As a result, his head was moved." The reporter was very surprised to hear this. Does visiting a brothel warrant the death penalty? I finally took advantage of the sentries blocking others to quickly sneak into the crowd, and it took a lot of effort to finally break through the encirclement. What I saw at a glance was: a headless corpse lying on the ground. When I looked up, oh my, on the electric pole at the entrance of the Hengdeli Watch and Eyeglasses Store, there was someone hanging a human head. The blood under the head was still dripping intermittently. The face was not very clear, and the age was no more than twenty. Looking closely at the corpse, it seemed to be lying in the shape of a large character in the heart of the street. It was wearing a new gray cotton military uniform, and a pair of Japanese-style leather velvet boots. Judging from the situation, the neck must have been cut more than seven or eight times. The skin was retracted outward. Those who saw it had tragic faces. After the reporter looked around, I did not see anyone with a smile on their face. Some women lowered their heads and wiped their tears with handkerchiefs. In this gloomy atmosphere, although there were many people, it was very quiet, and no one spoke loudly. If they did, they were all talking in extremely low voices. No one knew why someone was killed on this day. Someone whispered, "It's terrible. He said as he was dying, 'Am I being killed just for taking a look'?"</p>
<p>Disturbing the Peace, Executed on the Spot</p>
<p>When I got up early the next morning, I went to Liuxiang again to inquire about what had happened. I only saw many more people than the night before. Half of the alley was full of people, and it seemed that it would be impossible to squeeze in again. Later, I heard a friend say, "There's a notice posted at Hai Shibi." The reporter hurriedly ran to the place where the notice was posted at Hai Shibi. Indeed, there was a circle of people. Fortunately, the notice was not posted too low. I only saw the following written on it:</p>
<p>"For the purpose of this notice: It is known that citizens of civilized countries abide by order, and armies of civilized countries strictly observe discipline. On the night of New Year's Day, Zhang Wenzheng and Liao Senhuai, two members of the Auxiliary Heavy Brigade, took the opportunity to disrupt order and disturb the peace while the masses were enjoying themselves. They were apprehended by military police and executed on the spot to serve as a warning. Hereafter, any similar illegal acts will be punished with death. This notice is hereby given for all to know. Listing Zhang Wenzheng, a native of Dingxiang, 25 years old, sergeant of the Transport Brigade, Liao Senhuai, a native of Guoxian, 22 years old, Second Lieutenant Special Service Chief of the Third Battalion of the Transport Brigade."</p>
<p>Head Hanging at the Alley Entrance, Corpse Displayed by the Wall</p>
<p>The reporter realized at this time that the deceased had committed the crime of disrupting order and disturbing the peace, and truly deserved to be killed. Killing one can serve as a warning to a hundred. But where was the other person killed? Someone said in Sidao Alley, so I ran to Sidao Alley. There I saw the head hanging on the gate at the entrance of Toudao Alley, and the corpse displayed by the wall. It was also wearing a new gray cotton military uniform. Most of the back of the head was gone, with small pieces of flesh hanging down. There was a pool of blood on the ground. The reporter could not bear to look at it any longer. By the time I returned, it was almost 12 o'clock. I don't know why no one collected the body.</p>
<p>Commander Sun Talks About How It Was Handled</p>
<p>Here, the reporter will write down the process Commander Sun (former Garrison Commander Sun Fulin) talked about the process to the reporters of Bing City: "Yesterday was New Year's Day, and various agencies issued orders for a three-day holiday. There were many tourists on the streets, especially in entertainment venues. At about 8 PM yesterday, in Sitong Alley in the old city, there were about 40 soldiers in gray uniforms who had a conflict with other troops in a brothel. The order was suddenly disrupted, and the situation was serious. Military police rushed to the scene upon hearing the news to try and resolve it. Not only did they refuse to obey the ban, but they were even more unruly. Later, the Security Command learned of the incident and immediately sent officers and soldiers to arrest them. Most of them heard the news and fled. Zhang Wenzheng, a sergeant of the Ganzhong Brigade, and Liao Senhuai, a Special Service Chief of the Third Battalion, were arrested at the scene, and were escorted to the headquarters. After interrogation, they confessed to gathering to disrupt the peace without hesitation. They were sentenced to death according to the law. After submitting the report for approval, they were beheaded on the spot to serve as a warning. At that time, at 9:30 PM, the criminals were separately escorted to the south entrance of Liuxiang and the entrance of Sidao Alley for execution."</p>
<p>Here are a few words from the × newspaper, which show the situation at the time of the incident: A businessman said in a low voice, "Yesterday at around 9 o'clock, two people chased and killed this person. His head had already been cut off, but his body still ran a few steps before falling down." Everyone who heard it was amazed.</p>
<p>Zhimen's Fire Endangers the Fish in the Pond</p>
<p>This news was published in various newspapers on the 3rd (the 2nd was a day off). Because a certain newspaper carried the words "more than 40 people from a Transport Brigade," the Transport Brigade believed that it did not conform to the facts, so it sent a letter to correct it, saying: After hearing about the incident, this brigade sent Deputy Officer Zhou De to Sidao Alley to investigate the truth the next morning at 9 AM. According to the report, after asking the local street office and merchants, as well as the boss of Baohua Hall and the girls, they all claimed that both sides in the fight each had 30 to 40 people, but they were all wearing yellow military uniforms. This brigade was wearing gray cotton military uniforms. Since they were "the fish in the pond endangered by the fire at Zhimen," and it was said that more than 40 soldiers of this brigade fought with a certain unit, it did not conform to the facts.</p>
<h3>Is There No Winter in Kunming?</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xu Jilian</p>
<p>Kunming, 14th [of the month] Airmail</p>
<p>People all say that Kunming has no winter, but in reality, it doesn't even have summer, does it? Therefore, you won't sweat like crazy, with the sun blazing overhead, but at the same time, you don't need to light a stove or wear a thick fox fur robe. In this mountain city, the weather is truly wonderful. The summer can definitely be considered a summer resort, and the winter is even more a paradise for people who are afraid of the cold and have no warm clothing!</p>
<p>At this time of year in Jiangnan, people are probably shivering and pulling in their necks, lighting fires and putting on fur coats. However, in Kunming, people never even think of the cold or thin clothing. It's truly hard to believe. Here, except for a bit of chilliness in the early morning and late evening, during the day, a healthy person can wear a lined garment and not feel cold. The sun rises early in the morning, and it is still so warm and pleasant, never tiring, never showing favoritism. It shines gently on the mountain city forever!</p>
<p>Climate Naturally Blessed, Business Facing Harsh Winter</p>
<p>Although the climate is naturally blessed, without cold or heat, in the man-made world, everything is indeed facing a harsh winter. Moreover, the warm climate cannot melt the bitterness in people's hearts. The most prominent examples of this are the groups hustling and bustling in the business world.</p>
<p>Kunming was once known as a paradise for adventurers, a fertile land owned by gold diggers. However, good times don't last forever. Now, this paradise is also tasting the bitter fruit. A foundation of sand cannot support tall buildings of steel and cement. In the past, some speculators adorned a fancy facade, putting all their efforts into appearances. As time went on, the paint on the facade peeled off, and the true face of Mount Lu was finally revealed. Thus, the true form emerged. It not only made the people in the collapsing building unable to rise, but even the onlookers outside gasped, thinking: So this is what an ugly appearance looks like!</p>
<p>High-Interest Loans in Recession, Daily Credit Failing Daily</p>
<p>High-interest loans were the first to encounter bad luck. In Kunming, the potential power of "daily credit" is the greatest. It controls the life and death of ordinary people. Its prevalence and depth are unmatched by any credit loan. Therefore, "daily credit" has become the biggest headache for commercial banks, because "daily credit" is the most convenient for ordinary people, the procedures are simple, and they don't have to endure the ugly faces of the small clerks in the bank. Payment is easy, so credit associations have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, reaching more than a hundred in just a few months. The target of deposit absorption is naturally mostly ordinary people. The municipal authorities, thinking that a crisis was imminent, stipulated many management methods. But even while they were still in the registration period, the "credit heads" of the credit associations could no longer support themselves, and they absconded with the money. As a result, this caused fear among the ordinary people, who successively withdrew their credit, which was not accepted. The credit heads were fundamentally short of funds. The reason they were able to maintain appearances at the beginning was entirely dependent on the 24% high-interest loans, borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, preventing collapse. But now that the collapse has begun, the overall collapse has started. This collapse after collapse has plunged the Kunming economy into a deep crisis!</p>
<p>Zhengyi Road to Be Renovated, Near Day Tower Feels Lonely</p>
<p>Regardless of how bad the market situation is, the work of beautifying the city must always be addressed. The stately Three Archways of Zhengyi Road, regardless of the opposition from elders and people who believe in Feng Shui, was finally demolished. Recently, the wall posters and slogans of the debate at the Near Day Tower have all been swept away, and the surrounding walls have been freshly painted. The past chaotic scene, with one thing here and another there, under an order to "rectify the city appearance," has become "clear after the rain." The Near Day Tower in winter also feels a bit lonely.</p>
<p>The road administration of the mountain city is quite bad. Except for one flat Taihe Street, the others are all rugged and uneven, and pedestrians suffer from the discomfort of bumps. Therefore, the authorities have listed the major renovation of Zhengyi Road as one of the central tasks of this year's municipal administration. Work has already begun, and the renovation period should not be far away. It should be said that Zhengyi Road really should be rebuilt, because even the "car-owning class" is always worried about "overturning," let alone some "street runners"?</p>
<p>Serious Layoff Problem, Seventy-Year-Old Man Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Speaking of layoffs, Dianyuan has done it quite thoroughly this time. From the provincial government to various departments and agencies, they have all "reorganized" in a swift and decisive manner. The number of people laid off accounts for about one-third of the total. Some were reassigned, and some were simply laid off. Naturally, there were many tragedies in between. The laid-off people are facing endless worries. Facing the New Year, it is also the Old Year. The whole family is drinking the northwest wind. Only those who have personally experienced it can understand this feeling. For example, recently, a technician from the Yunnan Survey Bureau joined the bureau in the third year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty. In terms of time, it cannot be considered short, and the performance of the service is also very good, but he was finally dismissed. All alone, without a wife or children, he was already seventy years old. Thinking that he would be almost done after another two years, but his stomach did not agree, he finally swallowed four cents of high-quality Yunnan soil and died. Even the funeral arrangements were taken care of by his former colleagues. This tragic fact is an episode in the winter of the mountain city!</p>
<p>Kunming's warm winter is coming to an end again, but the cruel reality is pressing down on people. When spring comes to the earth, people only greet that series of days with a bitter smile!</p>
<p>Correction: According to the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the Bangkok Airmail "Overseas Chinese in Siam" published in this newspaper on December 2, 1946, it was mentioned that officials extorted and were corrupt, and the bribery in the case of Taiwanese overseas Chinese amounted to more than one million Qian coins, and that Ambassador Li was busy with social banquets and did not negotiate and handle pending cases, etc. After investigation, there is no factual basis. According to a letter from the Siam Chinese Chamber of Commerce: The communication said that the overseas Chinese leaders started newspapers at their own expense due to attacks from overseas Chinese and criticism in the media, all of which are untrue. Accordingly, we hereby urgently correct this.</p>

<h3>The Legend of a "Volunteer Soldier"</h3>
<p>— Wang Ji</p>
<p>Clang clang clang…</p>
<p>The whistle of the steamer tears through the tranquility of this small town every day without fail. Men, women, old and young, rush out from the kitchen, the toilet, or the sheepfold to see this rarely seen "fire wheel ship."</p>
<p>From this county to that county, the small town is fortunate enough to become such a thoroughfare, allowing this group of almost primitive people to broaden their horizons; or, there are also a few "upper-class people" who benefit from its light. As time goes on, the sailboats can no longer withstand this "fire wheel ship." The boatmen begin to feel jealous, asking:</p>
<p>"Whose ship is this that's stirring up the entire narrow waterway?"</p>
<p>The primitive people are starting to dislike this "useless" "monster."</p>
<p>Whose ship is it? One day, it finally spread in the teahouses and restaurants…</p>
<p>Less than five miles from the town, Hupu Creek has a famous lazy person. His father was an opium addict who originally had some "property." The guerrillas treated him as a "god of wealth." When they couldn't squeeze any money out of him, they gave him a "violation of national law" and executed him. His son, Hu Shengxiang, saw his father smoke away his family fortune into an opium pipe and lose his life. With nowhere to turn, he also joined the guerrillas, becoming a "godson." As a result, he inevitably learned that "vocal style": tending cattle, cutting rice ears, and even working as a cook for the Japanese. After a "bitter victory," Hu Shengxiang did not "win" away that style. Instead, it intensified. The small town often suffered his "infringement." He called himself a "hero," but the residents of the small town gave him an unrefined title: little gangster.</p>
<p>Conscription came.</p>
<p>The sound of conscription stirred up the small town even more intensely than the collection of grain. One man from every other household; secret drawing of lots… The people who ran the fried dough stick shops stopped cooking. The tofu makers ran away early in the dark. Young people were rarely seen in the shops. The vitality of the small town was extinguished day by day.</p>
<p>The town office, the district office, and the household registration clerks were correcting the household registers… To apply for an exemption, they handed over all sorts of certificates. When they walked, their chests were puffed out, and all sorts of badges on their clothes shone brightly. Most of those who couldn't get away and couldn't get all sorts of certificates seemed like flies that had died today, struggling towards hope, struggling: requesting a joint guarantee from five households, saying they were the only son, but there was an older brother who had been living separately for several years. Afraid of being reported, who would dare to provide this guarantee? Saying they had to support the family? The head of the district said, isn't your stall worth hundreds of thousands?</p>
<p>As the day for drawing lots approached, the draftees were like prisoners awaiting execution. "If I'm chosen, I'll prepare to escape. Who wants to fight in the civil war? Bah, that's just nonsense."</p>
<p>The words of the conscription supervisor added to the draftees' infinite hatred. What to do?</p>
<p>One evening, less than a week before the "secret drawing," the county suddenly issued an official notice, saying that the government wanted to recruit volunteer soldiers. A notice was also posted, saying "permission to offset the conscription quota," and saying "spiritual and material assistance can be given."</p>
<p>[Material, oh, material!]</p>
<p>This door was finally opened with great difficulty.</p>
<p>After several "town representative meetings" were held, the town office separately issued "secret" notices to each district head: two people must be recruited from each district. Each eligible draftee must pay three dou of white rice.</p>
<p>Volunteer soldiers! Volunteer soldiers! After the separate "mobilization," District Head Feng settled on Hu Shengxiang.</p>
<p>"Serving in the military is the most honorable thing. The government also provides rewards and assistance to volunteer soldiers…" District Head Feng also learned a bit of official jargon, because, in theory, the district head could be granted a deferment.</p>
<p>"How much money? Just one sentence. If you keep babbling, you're a bastard!" Hu Shengxiang said bluntly.</p>
<p>"Fifteen shi of rice. Neighboring counties are only ten shi."</p>
<p>Hu Shengxiang pursed his lips and walked away unwillingly.</p>
<p>Two days passed, and District Head Feng was still frowning. He contacted Hu Shengxiang several times and promised him 800,000 national currency.</p>
<p>The "volunteer soldier" dispelled the sense of misery in the small town. The "secret drawing" was postponed. The small town sent out twelve people as scheduled. Firecrackers and paper flags were distributed by the town office, making the "mobilization" lively for a while. Hu Shengxiang touched his full bag. He seemed to have an idea and laughed along with a firecracker.</p>
<p>He entered the city. Hu Shengxiang was assigned to the new recruit concentration camp. Camp Commander Gao Deli used his eyes to search the new recruits for two consecutive days. On the third day, Hu Shengxiang couldn't stand it anymore. He ran over and patted him on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"Camp Commander seems to have led guerrillas here three years ago." Hu Shengxiang flattered, without waiting for Gao Deli to respond, he continued: "It's just that I wasn't under Camp Commander's command at that time." "Oh, you?"</p>
<p>"Hu Shengxiang, reporting to Camp Commander." He said expertly: "I'm here to be a volunteer soldier, Camp Commander, I…please have a cigarette, don't laugh at me."</p>
<p>A stack of paper, Camp Commander Gao Deli saw very clearly. At first, he pretended to be very unnatural, and then he relaxed into a shallow smile.</p>
<p>"He's an old soldier after all." Hu Shengxiang said further: "It's just a little something. Oh, Camp Commander, it will take a few more days to start training, right? When I'm idle, I always have to, always have to, use my brain…</p>
<p>Hu Shengxiang's words became lighter and lighter. Finally, he brought his mouth close to Camp Commander Gao Deli's smiling face.</p>
<p>The next day, there was gambling in the concentration camp, led by Hu Shengxiang…</p>
<p>Before the physical examination and official enrollment, Hu Shengxiang was fortunate enough to win nearly 20 million. He began to hesitate about this huge sum of money. He had such a hypothesis early on, and now it came. "Why did I come to be a soldier?" He asked himself a question, touched the bag in his pocket, and smiled.</p>
<p>"A 14% interest…being a soldier, that's for ghosts!"</p>
<p>He grinded his teeth and made up his mind.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the medical officer came to re-examine the physical condition. Hu Shengxiang lay in the rice pile with a stomachache, calling for his mother. Camp Commander Gao Deli said a few words to the medical officer. The medical officer took the stethoscope to examine him and nodded and walked away. ——On the day the new recruits began training, Hu Shengxiang was "eliminated" with full satisfaction.</p>
<p>Hu Shengxiang walked down the street a little tipsy. He seemed to have had a big dream. He almost exchanged his life for this awakening. When he woke up, he thought about the large sum of money, the money exchanged for danger… He decided to use it to wash away the dirt of his life… Dududu</p>
<p>From this county to that county, the whistle of the steamer tears through the tranquility of this small town every day without fail. Men, women, old and young, go from surprise to disgust. Now, the residents of the small town often follow behind the steam whistle with an envious tone:</p>
<p>"Look, Hu Shengxiang is rich, the boss of the fire wheel ship!" (Late at night, December 25, 1946, Hangzhou)</p>
<h3>Dream Outside the Tower Poetry</h3>
<p>— Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>I occasionally climbed to the upper platform to lean on the setting sun, the endless mist and willows were shimmering, the dragon coiled power was exhausted, and the cold mountain remained, the name of the ox head remained, and the old ruins were desolate. Lonely crickets on the side of the boat missed the Later Lord, and the bright mirror in the middle laughed at the Former Liang; Who knew the days of talent and unrestrainedness, and saw the public go down to Wuchang.</p>
<p>The Double Ninth Festival in the Year of Bingxu</p>
<p>Tired and still climbing the highest chess, who knew the outside of the tower was full of desolate hills; the dream of the crowned locust palace connecting with the clouds, relying on the worries of mulberry and hemp in Luli by the water; Hungry ants touching their whiskers and soaring into war, sad crickets shaking their wings and abandoning themselves to rest; How could I bear to unfold the Qingqiu Festival, and stand alone in the cold sky for a moment.</p>

<h3>West Lake - Random Memories from a Window</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>"If you want to compare West Lake to Xizi, it is always suitable with light or heavy makeup." This is why West Lake is West Lake. But West Lake, it is better to treat it as a small park. If you want to get some lofty and great emotions here, you will be disappointed. West Lake is like a beauty, not a hero. I went to West Lake twice. The first time was at eight or nine in the morning in the spring. I took a boat on the shore of the lake and saw the green hills and weeping willows. I was indeed drunk and infatuated. The water of West Lake is clear and shallow. Sitting on the boat and looking at the scenery in a circle is like leaving the world. On the boat, you can see the fish, shrimp, duckweed, and algae in the water. The ripples of sunlight shine on the bottom of the lake, like the patterns of wrinkled gauze. The mud at the bottom of the lake is commonly known as "incense ash mud," which means that the mud is fine and loose. If a person falls in, they will indeed sink deeper and deeper until they are submerged, so you must not think that the lake water is shallow and you will not drown. The boat floats on the lake, the water is pushed open by the bow of the boat, forming two water patterns like arrowheads dragging behind. Another wave pattern is created by the boatman's oar. There are many small boats, and there are also many of these wave patterns, crisscrossing and winding on the lake like snakes, which is a pleasing sight. The reflections of the surrounding mountains hang in the heart of the lake, which is also a moving picture, like things placed on glass. There is no difference between the real and the fake, and it is the same to look at it upside down. If people lie flat on the ground to see these up-and-down scenery patterns, they will suspect that they have walked into the glass. In the evening, looking at the side of the panoramic view of West Lake on the shore of Hangzhou also has a special taste. The setting sun dyes the sky behind the mountains red, and reflects the water in the lake red. There is a green belt on top of this, which is the ripple of the water. Cooking smoke floats up from behind the ball-like clusters of trees, and the bells of countless temples ring.</p>
<p>Drinking Shaoxing wine in a thatched cottage under the willow shade in the drizzling rain, or fishing by the water, has a very hermit-like childlike taste. Going to the temple to chat with the monks will make you envy the monks enjoying all the blessings. Strolling with a girlfriend on the Su Causeway and the Bai Causeway will remind you of the stories of talented scholars and beautiful ladies. Watching the farmers walking in the rainy field in their straw raincoats, you will feel the elegance of the "Southern School Painting." Going to the monk's temple to eat bamboo shoots and large mustard greens, the fresh wild taste makes you want to be a monk. Going to Xinghua Village to eat drunken shrimp and perch fish, you want to write some crooked poems. As for going to Lingyin Temple, Yue Wang Tomb, Su Xiao Tomb, Gushan, Qiu Jin, Xu Xilin, and Wu Song's tomb, you will think of many people of different natures who have all passed away. But West Lake was later destroyed by modern civilization. The second time I went to West Lake, I saw that Western-style houses had been built on the mountains, and cars were running on the lake embankment, and speedboats were running on the lake. This is imitating the West, but the trees, flowers, plants, and villages of West Lake are genuine Chinese postures, so West Lake does not look as beautiful as before. Xizi has become a fashionable woman, and the most regrettable thing is that the Leifeng Pagoda on Nanping Mountain has collapsed, which has reduced the beauty of West Lake a lot. If it weren't for the Leifeng Pagoda being illuminated by the setting sun, how beautiful it would be to stand red on the mountain?</p>
<h3>Northern Wind and Sand - Random Memories from a Window</h3>
<p>— Previous Person</p>
<p>Why is the wind and sand in northern China so severe, but a few hundred miles across the Yellow River, there is no wind and sand? Is it that the wind from the Mongolian desert stops here? The soil is also extremely strange. A few hundred miles across the Yangtze River, the soil is sandy. The wind and sand outside the Great Wall, needless to say. There is also a saying in Beijing: "Three feet of dust without wind, a street of mud with rain." Dust should be brushed on people's bodies all year round. Therefore, the "duster" tool is available in every household in the north. If southerners are the same, using a chicken feather duster is not enough. When people arrive in Tianjin and Beijing and get off the train, someone will take a "duster" to wave your clothes and pat them a few times, scaring you, and then asking you for money. This is a method of begging. It is more practical than a beggar who only says auspicious words. This also shows that the sand and dust in the north must be removed from time to time. In fact, when people come back from the street, their faces and bodies are covered with sand and dust. And the most terrible place for sand and dust is Kaifeng. Every spring, it is the time when the "yellow wind" blows. The wind rolls up the sand, covering the sky and filling the streets. The sun is dark, and people struggle in the sand and dust. In these days, when people wake up in the morning, they will see that they have been buried in the sand quilt, on the quilt, on the table, covered with a thick layer of sand and dust. It is impossible to remove the sand and dust in the food. Sand is air, and air is sand. Air penetrates everywhere. What can you do?</p>
<p>This sand is the silt sand in the Yellow River. It is dried by the sun and blown by the wind, constantly blowing towards the city. The sand blows to the ground and is blocked by the city walls. The sand accumulates outside the city. The sand dunes outside Kaifeng are as high as the city walls. People don't have to walk through the city gates to leave the city. If someone attacks Kaifeng, it is a place that will be broken without attacking. In fact, Kaifeng has no value in many things because it cannot be defended. If there are problems in Xuzhou and Zhengzhou, everything in Kaifeng has long been resolved. Therefore, apart from wind and sand, Kaifeng is not a place that is often killed.

<p>New Fable</p>
<h3>Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Time: First month of the Dinghai year</p>
<p>Location: Wuding Road</p>
<p>Characters: Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth</p>
<p>Overture—In the Dinghai year, gold is prosperous and fire is strong. In the midst of loud gongs and drums, gold is soaring, and people are thinking about "gold." Water is also unwilling to lag behind. The sky is gloomy and rainy, a dark and chaotic scene. "Wood" is eager to move, taken advantage of by "Fire." Suddenly, white smoke emerges from the "wood" house, making it difficult for a piece of "clean" earth, inch of gold land.</p>
<p>When the curtain rises, there is a noisy crowd, fire and smoke slowly rise, drizzle falls, adding fuel to the "Fire."</p>
<p>The Earth and Wood clans are scorched all over, and they are busy making a phone call to Big Brother Water: "Hey, this is terrible! Brother Fire intends to get rid of us, please do a good deed and come to the rescue! At this moment, you are our only savior!"</p>
<p>Don't "Tease Me"</p>
<p>Water lazily picked up the phone: "Hey, don't "tease me", okay? It's the first day of the New Year!"</p>
<p>Earth: "No matter what, please help! I know everything in my heart!"</p>
<p>Water: "What know, empty words, not good business! First day of the New Year, don't be so long-winded!"</p>
<p>Wood: "Hey: Nothing is more urgent than putting out a fire! Can we talk about everything later? This is terrible, terrible, sparks are flying everywhere, it's tragic! Help!"</p>
<p>Water: "Don't be so loud and exaggerating! If the old is not destroyed, the new will not come. . . . First day of the New Year, brother is busy!"</p>
<p>In the midst of the sound of putting out the fire, phone calls asking Big Brother Water for help came one after another. He, intentionally or unintentionally, picked up two phones with both hands:</p>
<p>"What, where is it? When did the fire start? Why did the fire start? What is the last name, what is the first name, what is the street number?" . . . He blinked his eyes to the Water brothers, and all the clever plans were unspoken.</p>
<p>The flames flew high, and the red light shone everywhere; "Fire" laughed, and "Water" also laughed, a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>New Year's Wealth</p>
<p>With an awe-inspiring demeanor, the sound shook the ground, and the Water brothers finally arrived in military uniform. The leader busily congratulated the Fire God on the New Year's wealth, and then said: "It's okay! It's okay!"</p>
<p>Not Too Early, Not Too Late</p>
<p>After a brief exchange of greetings, Fire said: "Brother, you came not too early, not too late, it's really just right! Don't worry, I'm opening up a fire road for you, there's no need to tear down this foreign house, the neighbor is hiding Big Brother "Gold", please ask him to say a word, and then everything will be done!"</p>
<p>"That's right! That's right! First day of the New Year, do you want us to grow up drinking the northwest wind?"</p>
<p>Gold: (Calm and proud) - "Okay, Lord Gold Eight is here, brothers, please handle it!"</p>
<p>A thousand calls and ten thousand summons are not as good as one word from "Gold Eight." Water finally came out of the belt, walking slowly. The flames and water flowers contrasted each other, the water sprayed into the sky, and the fire flew left and right; then, the fire rushed to the right, and the water ran to the left, pouring, pouring, pouring until the boxes were overturned and the treasures grew wings, and everything was done. Only the gold objects and soft things were saved.</p>
<p>Burning, burning, burning for thirteen hours, pouring, pouring, pouring to a full load! Saving, saving, saving a scorched earth!</p>
<h3>Our Concerns about the Municipal Symphony Orchestra!</h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>We oppose disbandment!</p>
<p>We haven't heard from the Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra for a long time.</p>
<p>Before the Lunar New Year, the orchestra was brewing over the issue of "New Year's salaries," followed by rumors of "disbandment," "private takeover," and so on. At the same time, the routine performances at the Lyceum also came to a halt. We, who cherish the future of Shanghai's music, are very distressed!</p>
<p>Just considering the music books and scores owned by the orchestra (some of which are out of print), this only complete symphony orchestra in China, with a history of over sixty years, should not be allowed to fall into its current state. It is shameful that this artistic asset was originally the achievement of foreigners; we took it back, but we cannot use it well. In the Mei Baiqi era, everything was well-organized, and they performed regularly. Although some people criticized the foreign musicians for being too well-paid, when Mei Baiqi served as conductor and director, the stability of the musicians' lives, their improving skills, and their high standards contributed significantly to our musical culture, which cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Don't Waste the Opportunity</p>
<p>Most of the musicians are old, and their experience is valuable, but life is short. Most of the musicians are about to reach retirement age. Therefore, now that we have taken back the orchestra to be managed by us, the first priority is to use this valuable foundation to continuously add new Chinese performers, gradually creating a Chinese symphony orchestra in Shanghai. In the past, during the Concession era, it was regrettable that this artistic asset was funded by Chinese people but controlled by foreigners. Now that it has been taken back, we should not waste this good opportunity culturally, and we should not "lose face" internationally! (If we cannot manage it well after being free from foreign management.)</p>
<p>Of course, everything is for the sake of funding! In the past, the municipal government only subsidized 20 million yuan per month, and the revenue from performances was deposited into the municipal treasury, which cannot be said to be not worth it! Now, in order to improve the musicians' salaries, the municipal government needs to subsidize 50 million yuan per month in the budget. I think it is still worthwhile! As long as there is no mismanagement and the accounts are clear, the government should take a longer-term view of this cultural investment!</p>
<p>Most of these musicians can teach and take in students, and do not necessarily have to rely on the orchestra as their only profession. Therefore, their salaries cannot be too low; if they are too low, they may disperse completely. Moreover, music requires concentration when life is too unstable. In the Mei Baiqi era, they rehearsed five times a week. After we took over, it was only two or three times, and now it's unnecessary to mention it. In all fairness, they are suffering too much. Their monthly salary is only about 300,000 yuan. Except for top-tier figures such as Magolinsky (the current conductor) and Adler (the principal violin), whose income is quite good because they teach more classes and are busy accompanying private concerts, most of the musicians are still diligently practicing all day long and do not take on other jobs, but the authorities cannot give them a more stable life.</p>
<p>Fear and Anxiety</p>
<p>The only good phenomenon after we took over is that the number of Chinese performers has increased, and the number of Chinese audiences has also increased. But how long ago was it that there was talk of disbanding the symphony orchestra? This news is truly frightening and anxiety-inducing for us who are hungry for music and art!</p>
<p>In today's situation where the municipal treasury is empty and the finances are stretched, we dare not make a big deal out of the symphony orchestra. However, due to a genuine desire to cherish art and talent, we have reason to request the government: give us the rights that people in civilized countries should have - legitimate music!</p>
<h3>Beware of the Old Japanese Trick!</h3>
<p>— Hua Min</p>
<p>Seeing in the newspaper that our country's exports to Japan will still be dominated by salt made me feel extremely terrified. According to reports, our country exported 300,000 tons of salt to Japan last year, and the Japanese will use it to manufacture alkali in addition to consumption.</p>
<p>We know that salt is a compound of nitrogen and sodium. Electrolyzing it can yield nitrogen and metallic sodium, and alkali is just a byproduct of the electrolysis process. Sodium is a very expensive metal, and nitrogen can be made into that terrifying killing weapon, the nitrogen gas bomb. We shouldn't be so forgetful, right? The enemy used it to slaughter our loyal soldiers and innocent people. Mentioning it makes everyone shudder. Although it has been banned internationally, chlorine is still very useful in industry. It has the function of sterilization and disinfection, and it is the main ingredient in bleaching powder. Now, Japan is buying cheap raw materials - salt - from our country, and will use them to produce expensive industrial products to sell to our country. The outflow of rights and interests cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>Before the war, Japan's method of extracting money from our country was to use the principle of "raw materials from China, industry in Japan." They transported our cotton away, wove it into cloth, and then sold it back to our country, impoverishing our people. Now they are playing this trick again. I hope everyone will pay attention and not be deceived by them. At the same time, I hope our great gentlemen will not be too "magnanimous" or too "nationally minded." 300,000 tons were already tricked away last year. Can we let them deceive us year after year? It seems ridiculous for a major country called "one of the five powers" to be deceived by a defeated third-rate country.</p>

<h3>Water Melody</h3>
<p>— Sui</p>
<p>(Feeling moved by the frequent air disasters)</p>
<p>When will the good times come? Pushing open the window,</p>

<p>I don't know what year it is, And I lose sight again!</p>
<p>Which god is in charge of the year? Science is advanced,</p>
<p>I want to ride the wind and return, But why does this hatred still linger?</p>
<p>I also fear the bad weather, Perhaps heaven is jealous of things,</p>
<p>I can't help but feel cold inside: Fast, stable, and cheap,</p>
<p>Going through the air for a moment, This matter is difficult to complete!</p>
<p>Forever leaving the world! Still take a foreign car,</p>
<p>A thousand miles in just a few days!</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra</h3>
<p>— Suo Ying</p>
<p>The predecessor of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra was the Municipal Council Orchestra, founded in 1881, and has had a friendship with the people of Shanghai for more than sixty years. At the beginning, it was called the "Shanghai Public Band," and the first conductor was Lei Mo Sai. The musicians were mostly invited from Hong Kong and Macau, and later a group of talents was also recruited from Manila. In 1907, the new conductor Bai Gu and six European musicians arrived in Shanghai at the same time, and the content was gradually enriched. During the First World War, the orchestra almost disintegrated due to the influence of the current situation. In 1919, the famous pianist Mei Boqi passed through Shanghai and stayed due to illness. He was invited to be the conductor of the Municipal Council Orchestra. Mei received an award in Vienna at the age of seventeen and had profound attainments. Therefore, his contribution to the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra for more than 20 years was witnessed by the people of Shanghai. Unfortunately, Mei passed away in Shanghai on August 3 last year. Today, the Shanghai music scene is sighing that no one can compare with Mei Boqi's cultivation. His death is an irreplaceable loss to the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra today!</p>
<p>During the period of occupation, the orchestra was forced to change its name. After the victory, it was taken over by the municipal government, and the position of director was held by a Chinese, but due to financial difficulties, the musicians' lives were not comparable to those in the Concession era. The current director is the overseas Chinese Xu Mianqing, and the conductor is Magolinsky.</p>
<p>Weekend</p>
<h3>Li Yuru Has Nowhere to Live</h3>
<p>— Shi Ren</p>
<p>The Peking Opera actress Li Yuru, known for her role as the Pagoda Girl, has been busy looking for a house to move into these days. The house she originally lived in, in Jiufuli, belongs to the Tianchan Stage. When Li became a famous actress, the issue of her accommodation should have been resolved by Tianchan, but it is unknown whether it was because the house in Jiufuli was too comfortable, or whether Tianchan Theatre didn't care about Miss Li's accommodation? She still hasn't moved until now. The Tianchan Stage wants to give that house to Ying Ergeng to live in. Yuru is ordered to vacate it within three days. Of course, Yuru has no reason to stay there, but she can't find a suitable place to live at the moment, which has made her very anxious these days.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Lunar New Year, Tong Zhiling has been performing at the Central Grand Stage in Nanjing, performing Xun-style plays such as "Two You in Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Pan Si Dong," which have been quite popular. When Zhiling decided to go to Nanjing to perform, she lived in the Central Hotel, which is the best-equipped hotel in Nanjing. For some unknown reason, this time she was invited to live in a small inn called Baile Apartment. This small inn is located in a narrow lane on the left side of the Central Grand Stage, which is full of muddy sludge. It is an old-fashioned two-story building, with board walls dividing it into small pigeon-like rooms. Our beautiful Miss Tong lives in room number twelve on the ground floor, just inside the entrance, using a pseudonym called Liang Wenying. I don't know if it's because she's afraid of being recognized, or if she has other intentions?</p>
<p>EMI is actively negotiating with Yu-style laosheng Chen Dahuo to record records. EMI intends to ask Chen Ling to record twelve sides of records at a price of 20 million yuan, and specifies that he record the complete plays "Farewell at Shaqiao" and "Great Baoguo." However, Chen only agreed to record six sides and refused to record the entire play. The outcome is still under discussion.</p>
<h3>The Good Governance of Cinemas</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Film From today onwards, cinema ticket prices have been reduced by about 10%. Although the reduction is small, in these times of rising prices, it is not without its merits. In fact, cinema operators and film producers are not losing out, because the entertainment tax has also been reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>For the same film, audiences often prefer to watch it in Cinema A rather than Cinema B. There are some great reasons for this. The environment, air, atmosphere, and even the screen, lighting, and dubbing in the cinema also affect the physical and mental enjoyment within those few tens of minutes, and should naturally be an important factor. In fact, this all depends on the management of the cinema authorities, which does not cost them much money, but the difference in the consequences is huge. For example, take "Dahua" Cinema. When you walk inside, you feel strangely warm, like spring. Now that coal prices are so expensive, you might think that it "costs a lot," but in fact, it only costs nine US dollars in fuel per day. Therefore, the matter is only whether to do it or not, and there are still ways to do it. Everything can be viewed in this way.</p>
<h3>Symphony Orchestra "Disbanded"?</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Music The Municipal Symphony Orchestra has been suspended for a long time due to funding problems. Recently, there have been rumors that the director will be replaced (it is rumored that it will be the President Dai Cuilun of the Conservatory of Music) and that it will be disbanded. The reporter visited the orchestra yesterday and was told that it will not be disbanded. The new budget (50 million yuan per month) is being reviewed by the mayor. If the new budget is approved, the salary of each musician can be increased to 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per month, and the conductor's salary will be one million. In view of the widespread rumors, the orchestra originally decided to reluctantly perform a chamber concert once tomorrow, but according to news last night, the performance has been postponed again due to the conductor's illness. It can be seen that the orchestra's problems are quite complicated.</p>
<p>In any case, if the orchestra is unfortunately disbanded or suspended for a long time, it will be an extremely unfortunate event for the Shanghai art scene!</p>
