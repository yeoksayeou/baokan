<h3>撤駐華美軍問題</h3>
<p>衆院擬請馬帥報告</p>

<h3>調整外匯說不准　關於一切謠言均為無稽　財政部某負責官員談話</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京四日電〕財政部某負責官員今日絕對否認政府不久將調整外匯之說，並指斥關於國軍空竭，形將停止一切支付之謠言為「謠言」。</p>
<h3>軍調部解放之前　三方面人士均禮貌周全　連日接觸頻繁過從頗多</h3>
<p>〔本報北平四日電〕軍調部之撤退工作。將在廣大之計劃上徐徐進行。共產黨並未如一般所預期值怨尤拂袖而去，美方在延安之觀察組亦將在雙方同意之下，盡　延長其「觀察」時間，年來爭執激烈之三方人員，値此分手前夕，均禮貌周全，似皆於為將來留一餘地。記者默察軍調部動態，有下列跡象可尋：（一）　共產黨軍調部之撤除，呈空前之緘默，不僅葉劍英拒見任何中外記者，即其新聞處，對此亦拒絕批評。僅有日前某要員發表談話謂：美方退出後，國共兩方旣未明令取消，似應覓取另外方式決定軍調部之存廢，弦外之音頗堪玩味。今日記者訊共產黨發言人黃華，共產黨對此次美軍撤退是否滿意？黃答：此問題須由延安答覆。溯自美方宣佈退出軍調部後，共產黨方面即聲稱，延安將有聲明，而迄今延安並無隻字發表。延安予葉劍英之訓令，亦寥寥數語，未作任何批許。延安對此事之慎重，槪可想見。（二）共產黨人員之撤退，將不如一般預期及共產黨前所宣佈之迅速。共產黨新聞處長黃華，明日赴延安聯絡，但在延作一夜逗留即返。劇黃稱：美方飛機因尚須運送其自方及政府人員，故共產黨何日能開始撤退，何日撤竣，俱不可知。另悉：美軍在延安之軍事觀察組，亦將俟共產黨人員撤竣後，再作撤離之計。記者詢黃華：共方是否將挽留或對觀察組表示惜別之意？黃答：惜別亦為人情之常。（三）林日三方人員接觸頗繁，尤以共美兩方頗多過從。昨葉劍英曾偕參謀長薛子正·新聞處長黃華，探視微患感冒之吉倫將軍，明日葉劍英聞可能參加蔡文治之宴，葉並擬歡宴國美兩方人員及記者，空氣之諧和，亦為前所未有。</p>
<h3>一週戰況的綜合觀察</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕自中央拒絕政府和談建議後，其積極叛國行動，已盡人皆知，但其所持以叛國之實力，則日見衰　，最近共軍於　稱以暴力恢復三十五年一月十三日態勢後，進行大規模之攻勢，然無一處不被國軍擊潰，其結果非但毫無所獲，且蒙受最大損失。茲將本週內共軍竄犯　况，分述於後：</p>
<p>魯南方面</p>
<p>進犯魯南共軍陳毅部，號稱十餘萬，來勢凶猛，陷嶧縣，掠齊莊，更配合其誇大宣傳攻勢，一般不明眞相者，竟多為其炫惑，實則共軍對每一城鎭之攻略，無不付以極大代價，故自棗莊陷後，共軍已氣盡力竭。是時隴海東段國軍，均已部署就緒，郝鵬舉部亦於是時舉義反正，魯南共軍自知末日降臨，妄圖作困臨門。自一月三十一由蒙陰抽調兵力萬餘，兼程增援臨沂，同時集中主力於棗莊，郯城，臨沂中間地區，以防國軍反擊。本月一日以來，國軍節節推進，大規模殲減戰態勢已成，一般預料半月內即可得輝煌戰國。</p>
<p>豫東方面</p>
<p>共軍劉伯誠部，為章制徐州國軍策應魯南，一週來鑚隙向豫東突進，犯拓城，攻鹿邑，陷泰康，雖四處流竄，究以魯南陳毅部敗勢已定，於其整個局勢毫無補益，且碭山，小壩，野雞崗等處，共軍已全被逐退，汴徐間鐵路恢復通車，　·沛·蕭·碭一帶，有國軍勁旅助手，不但徐州外圍固若金湯，且共軍劉伯誠部亦頗有因分散兵力致被國軍各個　殲之危險。</p>
<p>華北方面</p>
<p>晋西向孝義反擊之國軍，於一月廿二日收復馬莊營，孝義村，蘇家營等據點後，侵陷孝義之共軍，已　動搖。同蒲綫上之南關鎭及其以西之汾西，均為國軍攻復。晋南·晋西已無大部共軍活動。河北，平津綫上魏家莊，安定兩軍站，曾被共軍一度攻陷，旋經國軍收復，現已恢復通車，且國軍已派有力部隊，沿綫清剿。今後平津交通，當可安全無虞。平漢北段共軍，以二萬餘兵力猛攻定縣，前仆後繼，死傷枕籍，定縣雖難於一月二十八日被共軍攻陷，惟其付出代價，遠非常人可想像。目前國軍刻正以圍剿之態勢，向前推進中。</p>
<p>東北方面</p>
<p>渡松花江南犯之共軍，本週已全被逐退，國軍於一月二十四日渡松花江追擊，曾到達五棵樹以東，及陶賴昭附近地區，嗣以任務完成，安返南岸。</p>
<p>綜觀週來全國各地之戰爭，無一處不為共軍所發動者，且其進行之規律，亦頗相似，即戰門進行初期，共軍以孤亂態勢，全力猛撲，國軍則穩紮穩打，故表面上初期戰門共軍似有所獲，但終因其所付代價太高，不旋踵而敗。</p>

<h3>黃華赴延安　外記者隨行</h3>
<p>〔本報北平四日電〕中共宣傳處長黃華，明日赴延安聯絡，政府方面派梁其果少尉同機赴延，取回政府在延安之電台。此外並有天主教新聞社記者歐橋迹，芝加哥太陽報記者，馬可根，及三三二航空隊一女記者前往採訪。</p>
<h3>滬市某工業家　談工業與和平</h3>
<p>內亂不停工業陷絕境</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪某著名工業家，詢以內亂對於工業之影響及對工商和平運動之看法。氏認為內亂不停，工業將陷於絕境。因在目前之環境下，煤礦被破壞，交通綫遭切斷，原則之供給，產品之推銷，在在均成問題。且因政治之原因，工潮極易發生，工價不合理上漲，使人視投資工業為畏途。關於和平運動事，氏告記者：目前尚在徵求會員階段中，具體之實際行動，雖有考慮，尚未決定。本市某報建議以罷市抗稅為手段，此為專對政府之壓力，而與共黨有利而無害，以此為調停之方法，實欠公平。將來可能實行者，為推派代表赴延安南京，分頭呼籲。又各發起人願愼重聲明者，即並無藉調處而參加政府之意。</p>
<p>〔中央社杭州三日電〕浙記者公會等十一民衆團體，二日通電響應浙省參議會擁護和平統一宣言。</p>
<h3>熊式輝離贛飛京</h3>

<h3>梁漱溟意態消極</h3>
<p>民盟將召開中常會</p>

<h3>蘇聯在新疆各地　建經濟勢力範圍　美霍華特系報發表論評</h3>

<h3>世界糧荒嚴重　中國面臨饑饉</h3>
<p>紐約時報籲請富裕國予以援助</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約三日專電〕紐約時報於檢討世界糧食情况一文中稱：一且聯總結束，其於歐亞兩洲之工作後，中國將爲面臨飢饉或饑荒之諸國家中情况最惡劣者，據該報駐二十個國家之記者報道，表示無論吾人於一年前曾希望獲得何種之改進，一切戰勝及戰敗國之飢饉，均需要較富裕之國家予以援助，俾免於災難。預測聯總結束後，奧·希·匈·義·波·南均將遭遇極大之困難，尤以中國爲甚。據各記者之報道，世界糧荒之造成，初因農具牲書之毀壞死亡，繼因去歲歐洲遭遇破紀錄之旱災，該報除指出國外援助之必要外，並指出極重要之事實，即極適當之糧食分配及管制物價之重要性。該文謂：「英·捷·波·南各國人民，均感受同等之困難，蓋各該國黑市之風，遍及全國，中國尤甚，幾未遭政府之嘗制。」並謂：「由於黑市所予富者之便利及肆無顧忌，糧食黑市已成爲一重要之政治因素，並顯然將繼續保持此種情况，直至最後正式供應恢復時爲止。南京紐約時報記者竇尊安之報道謂，聯總於三月卅一日左右停止以物資輸華後，中國本年之情況將較往常尤劣，後者據客觀之統計結果觀之，已應稱之爲飢饉矣。實尊安於指出我國之飢饉必將造成今年嚴重之災荒後，復例舉下列諸項糧荒前途堪慮之事實：（一）去歲正常秋收後所餘之存糧無多，食糧不足之區域，恐不克維持至新　收割時。（二）據我行總之估計，一九四七年殺之收獲爲三百萬噸，將在平均水準之下。（三）聯總計劃中之糧食，大部已運抵中國，且已分配。（四）安徽已發生飢荒情形，湖南，廣西，廣東等飢饉貧瘡地幣之糧食供應情况，已日趨危急。</p>
<h3>張發奎對記者談話　粵未逮補攻治犯　肅清走私必需收回港澳</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州四日電〕張主任發奎頃在行轅官舍舉行本年首次之記者招待會，報吿制憲經過觀感及粵緝私並治安情形，據稱：決定我國一切大計之憲法，已順利通過，此爲世界上最進步之民主憲法，亦爲民主政治之靈魂，今年爲憲政准備實施年，朝野上下必共同努力，尤其官應先守法，以爲民之榜樣，始克達成法治目的。至外傳此間曾逮捕政治犯，此全屬中傷之謠言，毫無根據者，自粵光復後，實從未逮捕政治犯。其次對緝私案件去年底發生特多，如海鷗艦及登陸艇走私等案，已分別解京辦理，其餘在地方上緝私工作已加强，走私之風已稍歛跡，但要澈底肅淸，恐除收回香港·澳門，實無他法。至治安問題，本人向極注意，計卅五年度剿匪戰績，統計擊斃六千餘人，傷三千餘人，投降自新者二千六百餘人。現尙有殘匪約一三六〇〇餘人，其中海南島佔六千人，餘分布於閩二粵邊境及東北江南路一帶，但如要澈底肅瀋匪患，必須地方行政機構健全，始能收效也。</p>

<h3>社論　由金潮想到農民</h3>
<p>最近兩天來上海的黃金外滙市塲，突起劇烈波動。關於黃金，月前投機家曾掀風作浪，金價趨高；中央銀行乃不斷以大量黃金拋出，市况因以轉趨平定。到了本月一日金市與外滙忽又激漲，自三九六·五，跳出四百萬大關，漲到四〇六，至本星期一續漲至四四二，截至寫稿時止，已漲至四百八十萬，頗有越過五百萬大關的趨勢。在同時期內，美滙黑市由七千到了昨日一度漲至九千。在金鈔狂漲的潮流中，又引起其它物價的波動，就棉紗而言，一一月一日棉紗市塲即爲買氣所範眾，紗價普遍上漲，到了第二天，漲風益熾，一日之內，紗價狂跳五六十萬，四十二支雙股綫復出五百萬大關，紗市前途依然有欣欣向榮之概。至於米價，這幾天內的變動亦很大。此種市塲上的劇烈波動，到現在還沒有歇止的跡象；此其影響所及，關係整個民族經濟的安危。我們不能不正視這稱經濟上的波動。</p>
<p>此次經濟上的波動之所由興起，依我們的觀察，似不得不追溯到不久以前所傳的流言，說是政府對於外滙，又將新有調整。當局對於此項謠傳，雖一再否認，其奈投機家不惟不因此而歛跡，却反而推波助瀾，掀風作浪。據本報一月一日所載消息，謂「美鈔黑市激漲，金價竟被帶高。」到了後來，金價抬高了之後，於是又影審到滙市，影響到其它的市價。在這期間，中央銀行雖曾以巨額生金拋出，却未能歇止金鈔的上漲。且其中有一部分投機家，鑒於中央銀行旣將大量黃金數度拋出，竟認爲其實力已不足控制黃金市塲，因而大顯身手，在此種混亂情形之下，聞中央銀行不得不一度將黃金的拋出，暫行停止；此其結果，於是又引起金價，外滙黑市，及其它一般市價的上漲。此種因素，起了相互交替作用之後，致使市塲迄未能回復寗靜。</p>
<p>對於目前這種市塲上的變動，我們認爲心理因素起着很大的作用。此次市塲上的波動，最初就由於謠言，因謠言的流傳，加上了投機家的掀風作浪，於是到了很兇險的境地，利用這稱不健全的心理而掀風作浪，固然是投機家一貫的技倆；但有這種不健全心理的存在，終竟是一種病態，這種不健全的心理是缺乏自信的一種表徵。在目今動盪的世界裏，我們首先要建立自信。所以對於此次市塲的波動，我們首先應該提出的，就是要恢復我們的自信，不要爲流傳的謠言所惑。謠言傳布的本身，原存有一種惡意的作用；我們如爲謠言所惑，論其終極，不但個人蒙受損失，且於民族國家亦有很重大的影響。</p>
<p>建立健全的心理固然是一般人民所應爲，但我們有不能不提出來一問的，就是數府對於黃金究竟採取什麼政策？拋售黃金似乎是中央銀行亦即政府的一貫政策，然而施行的結果，却依舊未能收抑平金價的實效。這其中究竟出了什麼毛病？去年五月初，金價起伏，中央銀行於三日內拋出始赤三千餘條，當時的金價盤旋於一百六七十萬之際，到了七月，已漲至一九七，至十二月又漲至三九〇。另據上海市政府所發表之統計，卅五年一月的金價如爲一〇〇，到七月已漲至二一四，是在六個月內，金價上漲達一百十四倍。所以中央銀行儘管有黃金的拋售，初未能遏止金價的上漲，此其結果，徒然造咸一般投機家或從事於黃金買賣的人以囤積黃金的機會，造成了此等人的發財。聞昨日中央銀行的配售黃金，就有若干配戶，將配給的黃金囤而不發，於是又促成了金價的上勝。所以在此金價波動之際，我們要問政府對於黃金究竟採取什麼政策？</p>
<p>不用說金價的狂漲，影響到一般物價，促成一般生活費用的上漲。今日中國的工商界已經到了極艱苦的境地，一般生活費用的提高，無疑地必然影響到他們。由於一般生活費用的提高必然影響到職工活指數的提高；面在今日，一船工資率以生活指數爲標準，是其影響所及，必然促使一般工資的提高，加軍了一般從事於工商者的担負。目下交通阻滯，商品的流通旣橫遭打擊；又値　價舶來品的侵襲，中國的工商界本已返亟可危，如果再加上此次由於金價的狂漲而引起的影響，論其終極，似必迫使一般工商業的崩潰。爲了挽救我們的民族經濟，我們決不能聽任這種狂潮讓它奔馳下去。</p>
<p>然而受影響最深的，還是占中國人民百分之八十以上的農民。昨日正是農民節，農民節爲農民訴苦是極自然的主題。可是不論二五減租也好，耕者有其田也好；農民目前所遭遇的最大困難，端在「穀賤傷農。」所謂「榖賤」，不一定是指榖而言，乃是指一般農產品價格的低落，使農民難乎爲生，迫使他們不得不放棄盤事生產。據本報昨日所載消息，中國蠶絲公司願以桑苗一千五百萬株贈予浙省，但浙省農民都以　價廉，無以爲利，不敢領植，可見農產品價格的低落，迫使農民放棄農事的生產。如果讓此種趨勢自然發展下去，那將使整個民族經濟的前途，不堪設想。如今我們又看見有由金價的波動而引起的一般物價的提高，而農產品的價格卻未能迫隨這種趨勢以上漲；此其結果，必然使一般製成品價格的提高，轉使一般農產品價格相對的下落。農產品的價格已經賤了，今又迫使其再下落，此其結果，自然使農民生活的更趨困苦。節屆農民，我們不必侈言什麼農村救濟，最迫切的實莫甚於求一般物價的穩定，求農產品價格的提高；必使農民對於從事農達有利可圖，然後中國的農產　有活潑復蘇之望。農業是我國的主要生產，徜若農業不能復蘇，則民族經濟的前途，何堪設想。</p>
<p>要之，此次金價的波動所關實在重大。我們除籲請國民必須建立健全的心理外，更望政府能闡明其政策，使金價及一般物價得以穩定。至於所傳金價及一般物價的波動，乃由於國內局勢的惡化，此尤不是申辦，我們願大家能够建立自信起來。</p>

<h3>管制原子能計劃　美力謀貫澈初衷　普遍裁軍願獲致解決方案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖四日電〕據今晨獲悉：美代表奧斯汀將出席本日開幕理會。奧斯汀事前曾保證美國將與任何其他國家同樣迅速解除軍備，但在列强在廢棄原子能之管制，締成總日和約及建立國際警察。奧斯汀將在今日之會議中，堅持原子武器應加以管制，並將指出美國對於此一問題，已工作六閱月之久。奧氏並將說明，對於如何禁止原子武器，及如何監視不得非法製造原子彈一節，如列强不能獲致協議，則普遍裁軍根本無望。奧氏並將慎重指出，聯合國組織之最大目的，在於集體安全，而集體安全之中心工作，即爲國際管制原子能。奧斯汀爲打開美蘇間關於裁軍計劃之僵局起見，將提出已與其他代表秘密討論就緒之三點折衷方案：（一）設立委員會以討論廢棄武器之詳細方法，尤以「集體毀滅」之武器爲甚；（二）安理會代表應決定「集體毀滅」武器之定義，並說明普遍裁軍與建立國際警察如何發生連帶關係；（三）此次安理會應開始討論美國禁止原子武器之計劃。大部份代表均慎重考慮此項計劃，英代表會岡出修正辦法，但尚待倫敦方面之最後訓令，蘇聯則諒必反對美國之計劃。</p>
<h3>製造原子炸彈秘密　蘇聯已獲重要情報　巴魯克向國會報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕聯合國原子能委會前任美代表巴魯克，聞曾在參院原子委會秘密會議宣稱，現有證據，可知蘇聯對於美國製造原子彈秘密，已探悉至某種程度，惟蘇聯對於所探得之秘密，尙未確知其意義及如何加以運用。先是，巴魯克曾在參院原子委會指責科學家不應使陸軍當局鑄成大錯，將一九四五年史密斯報吿書發表。巴魯克發言至此，委會即請旁聽人退出，關閉會議室門，繼續聆聽巴氏報吿，其內容，各委員均不得對外發表。惟聯合社記者從某委員處得知其梗概，並從另一委員處加以證實。巴魯克並在參院原子委會宣稱，由蘇聯代表在聯合國原子能管制委會提出之某種問題而觀，足見美國對於製造原子彈之關防已有洩漏。例如美方所用密碼，蘇聯顯已探得，惟由其代表言辭觀之，密碼意義尙未明悉。巴氏稱加拿大對於鎮原素亦有發現，蘇間諜曾有在加拿大被捕情事，由此可信蘇聯已自加拿大探得若干秘密。</p>

<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷三日電〕巴勒斯坦政府本晚向此間猶太協會提出揩詞嚴厲之最後通牒，令其於七天內與軍警合作逮捕極端份子。該通牒並未提及如果此項要求被拒絕以後，政府將採取伺種措旅。據尙未證實之消息，此項要求如被拒絕，則除英國向猶太極端份子採取積極之軍事行動，可能實施戒嚴令外，英國並將不承認猶太協曾之國際地位。同時英外相貝文及殖民大臣瓊斯曾在倫敦與猶協代表商談二小時半，官方對會談結果守口如瓶，但指出關於解決巴勒斯坦問題一點，雙方意見上之距離並未接近。傳猶太代表曾要求：（一）增加巴勒斯坦之猶太移民；（二）全面發展巴勒斯坦之資源，（三）在適當地區，即在有發展可能之地區，建立猶太國家。另悉，英政府與阿拉伯領袖將於四日繼續舉行會議，屆時貝文將吿知阿拉伯代表渠與猶太代表會談之詳情。</p>

<h3>動亂中的　巴勒斯坦</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>…昔日的聖地，竟成今日的黑暗世界…</p>
<p>最近巴勒斯坦的猶太極端派重又燃起恐怖行動的烽火，各地陷入極度混亂狀態。某新聞記者將目擊實情叙述如下：</p>
<p>在聖誕節和新年祝賀聲中，聖地巴勒斯坦克是黑暗世界。由於過去幾天內猶太恐怖黨綁架和暗殺英國人的種種暴行，許多英國兵雖在下班時刻也隨身携帶着武器。記者曾目睹百餘傘兵喝得酩酊大醉，揚着機關槍，接收耶路撒冷中心的郇山廣塲。行人倉皇奔避，以免池魚之殃。</p>
<p>以前英國兵對猶太人只是竊竊私議，飛短流長，現在索性在大庭廣衆之間公然加以侮辱了。夜總會和酒排間裏英國官員的反猶太論調是到處可聞的。偶爾也發生搗毀猶太商店玻璃窗和公共塲所侮辱猶太人的事情。</p>
<p>商店提高打烊　全國各地地商店和咖啡館每晚六時即行打烊。商店櫥窗和門口都裝置鋼板，以防玻璃被搗。英國人的這種反猶太情緒乃是猶太恐怖黨對英軍所施暴行的結果。英國兵僅把自己看做個人，而不是英國對巴政策的執行者。所以當一個猶太恐怖黨員謀斃一個英國兵時，其他的英國兵都有敵愾同仇之感，尤以退伍軍人爲甚，他們覺得不死於戰爭而死於聖地是不値得的。可是大多數的英國兵很能抑制他們的情緒，他們雖多發議論，但絕少行動。許多猶太人都承認道一點。</p>
<p>先是英國兵曾鞭撻一個搶刧銀行的猶太靑年，猶太恐怖黨遂於去年十二月廿九日將英國軍官一人士兵三人加以鞭　，以爲報復。新的恐怖行動便一發而不可收拾。後來恐怖黨又使用一種最新的武器——液體噴火器，對付英國人。當世界猶太民族主義者大會在瑞士巴塞爾舉行時，伊爾根黨曾暫時宣佈休戰，今則重又展開了對英戰鬥。</p>
<p>炸案時常發生　耶魯撒冷的炸彈爆發案傳遍整個聖地。英國當局下令一切軍隊須隨身佩帶武器，並只許兩人一組巡邏各處。英政府於三日對猶太恐怖黨發出最後通牒：倘恐怖行爲繼續存在，英政府將採取嚴厲措置，或將類似去年夏間大衛生旅社炸彈案發生後所採取的軍事管制及審禁。英國駐巴勒斯坦高級專員克銀漢中將匆匆前往倫敦，與殖民地大臣鍾思及參謀總長蒙高馬利商談戰略問題。英政府和猶太人雙方均信克氏此行乃要求政府准許其對猶太極端派發動全面軍事攻勢。</p>
<p>猶太人分兩派　倫敦的猶太協會發言人最近發表談話，對猶太極端派的行爲表示遺憾；他說：「英帝國並未受到伊爾根黨行爲的威脅，未來的猶太民族倒很可能受到威脅」。美國猶太民族主義者組織的創辦人惠斯從猶太民族主義者大會歸來時，不滿該組織的職務，指責大會對於巴勒斯坦的恐怖狀態並未考慮補救辦法。</p>
<p>英猶或能諒解　從此輩穩健的猶太人的反響推測，猶太恐怖黨暴行的目的，不但要和英國陸軍挑戰，同時也想破壞穩健派的妥協政策。但是倫敦的猶太民族主義者領袖繼續固執地想成立一項協定。猶太協會首領戈里昂和上屆世界猶太民族主義者大會主席希望慫恿英人改變巴勒斯坦的現狀，上月猶太人拒絕參加倫敦的巴勒斯坦會議，就是爲了這些「現狀」的存在。戈氏表示：目前雖暫時不能成立協議，但殖民部的一番善意，或能促成英國人和猶太人的合作和諒解。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦英軍全身武裝，沿鐵路綫巡邏，以防猶太人敷設地雷。</p>

<h3>參會接密告　西摩路大火案節外生枝　牽涉一批警士</h3>
<p>葛姓災戶另有重要證件提供　宣局長表示有廿餘人須傳訊</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路火災調查委員會主任委員葛克信·參議會代表張逎作等，定今日參觀消防處。今晨十時，在市府大禮堂集合，先由消防處長周兆祥就現時之防火設施略作報告後，再分赴各消防處參觀，對於工具設施，經濟分配，及人事制度等，與工部局時代之火警處制度相比較，以資作改進之措鏡。</p>
<p>發掘王家火塲工作，原定昨日動工，因人事未及準備，已改於今日下午二時開始。警局督察處長張達，江寗區副分局長汪啓麟，區民代表劉精懦，參議會區黨部代表邵永生等，昨午曾假小沙渡路蔡國樑保長寓所舉行會議，決定先向市府支款六十萬，雇小工十人發掘，由張處長領導，警察分局·保甲處·及王家各派代表到塲監督，發掘工作定於三日內完成。昨日張處長等曾赴火塲巡視，對於發掘之地點步驟及殘灰堆塲等均已加以決定。</p>
<p>參議會代表張逎作，昨得章士釗律師之介紹信，謂有災戶葛某，對於火災調查委員會有重要證件可提供。葛某昨曾趨訪張迺作，適張氏因事出外未遇，故究係何種證件，現尙不得而知，唯葛曾表示必爲一極有力之犯罪證明，詳細情形，今日可明底細。又張氏吿記者，彼昨日獲悉曾有被災居民，向市參議會告密，調火後三十分鐘，有二變察及巡官一名，到塲觀看，十二時後，忽有數十名警察到來，站立十分鐘，未得民衆同意，即擅進火塲。有人會目睹其中一名之號碼爲一八五〇號，另一名內着警服，外穿短大衣，西髮，皮屑黝黑，自火塲出來時，衣袋飽滿，得意洋洋，過一時半後，重返原地，均有趁火打刦之嫌疑。張氏已定今日向參議會打聽詳情後，加以追究。</p>
<p>收集資料·極爲豐富</p>
<p>火災調查委員會載至目前爲止，收集之資料極爲豐富，今後之工作，當在於根據現有綫索，續一加以追究。如王家之酒瓶，顏家之號衣，被劈之衣櫥等，均須逐一傳詢消防員，以發掘犯罪事實。昨擄請委會方面表示，該項工作，是否仍由調委會繼續擔任，則有待於市長之決定。</p>
<h3>根據報告書　尚有廿餘人涉嫌</h3>
<p>調委會主委葛克信，已將一部分調查報吿書，於昨晨送呈吳市長，吳市長當表示可先由宣局長過目，故經由宣局長審閱後已於昨午送呈吳市長。據調委會透露，宣局長根據此項報吿書，認爲尙有與此案有關之嫌疑犯廿餘人，須加以扣押，今日或須加以傳又警局方面關於此番大火案之報吿書，早已擬就，預定待市長審閱後，即可公開發表，昨日記者特走訪吳市長，市長表示警局之報吿書正在審閱之中，近日因忙於抑平米價事，尙未及完畢，詢以何日可以發表，據吳市長表示，似無發表之價値，因火災調查委員會中，即有警局之代表（督察處長張達）參加，則調委會之報吿，必較爲詳盡客觀而公正</p>
<p>調查會即將解散</p>
<p>記者詢以對本案有何感想，吳市長答稱；本案之必須澈查”求其水落石出而杜絕後患，乃本人與宜局長共具之決心，事情究應如何解決，尙有待於調委會之全部報吿，吳市長並稱：調委會於收集全部資料後，即吿解散，其尙須繼續進行之調查工作及案中之刑事部份，由警局接辦之。</p>
<h3>今日地檢處　傳訊五災戶</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕地檢處已定今日上午八時，傳訊本案災戶王雲甫，顏澤之，鄭載堅，唐瑞千，周企舫等五人，查詢被災經過，或與被押之五消防員對質。</p>

<p>密告人姓名暫不宣佈庭論改期再訊</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕林森西路大德里卅一號花壇中匿藏二萬兩雅片一案，裴元俊，周阿三，施兆光三嫌疑犯，昨日地院開庭審訊，據破獲該案之常熱分局調查報吿書中稱：上月十三日下午五時有三三九號警士向値日室報吿謂：有穿軍裝者七八人，人大德里卅一號，聲稱爲搜查雅片，經局中派人查得，此項軍人係港務整理委員會警務組長兼警備司令部待查處副處長鄭重爲因獲密報，檢舉大德里卅一號花壇中藏有大批烟土，故派人前往發掘。警局乃會同搜查，果於天井水門汀花壇下掘得以木箱裝盛之大量烟土，秤得共一千另五十八市斤。該屋主人裴元俊適外出未歸，遂帶裴妻何蘭君人局偵訊，並在廣東路榮吉里四號申康綢織廠發行所將裴元俊拘獲，又在愚園路好萊塢花園將花匠周阿三及大德里卅一號原業主施兆光一併拘押。昨日審訊時，據</p>
<h3>交通界之多事之秋　京滬車常州損壞　全綫誤點六小時　司機鎮靜幸未肇禍　旅客貨特均無損失</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬綫上行第十次頭二三等夜特快車，前晚九時五十分，由北站開出，昨晨二時二十七分，駛抵離滬一百六十七公里之常州站附近時，機車前輪突吿碎裂，所掛各軍受此影響，發生猛烈震動，幾吿出軌傾覆。幸賴司機鎭靜，運用得法，未肇禍端，旅客及貨物均無捐毀。</p>
<p>出事地點，適値京滬兩地之聞軌交通處，致京滬路交通受其影響，全部受阻，列車停頓達六小時之久。後經路局戚墅堰車廠，派救護車前往搶修，全綫交通於昨日八時許，已吿恢復。</p>
<p>機車損毀之處，係屬荒郊，該局警務處聞悉後，乃急調遣附近路警，趕往保護，以防萬一。</p>
<p>由於第十次車之阻塞，京滬綫交通一度中斷，各次車輛均告誤點，前晚由京來滬之第九及第十一次車，均各延誤約六小時。北站昨晨由滬駛京之第六及第八次早車，及由京來滬之第五及第七次早車，均各暫停一天。</p>
<p>京滬路局爲减輕客運擁擠起見，昨日午後二時，另行增開頭二三等臨時客快車一次，所有第六及第八次已售出之車票，概予通用。聞南京方面，亦曾於昨日下午二時，加開頭二三等臨時客車，以載昨晨第五，七次車，由京來滬之旅客。</p>
<p>昨日蘇錫等地客車，則仍照常行駛，並未中斷。</p>
<h3>臨時專車明起停駛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區路局前爲調整擁擠，曾於上月二十六日增開臨時專車，現因客貨運物已恢復原狀，路局已定自明日起，、將該項臨時專車停止行駛。</p>
<h3>兩公司客機　未奉復航令　旅客登記甚爲擁擠　預料復航之期不遠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央及中國兩航空公司何時能恢復客運尙無確訊。外傳中央航空公司已塞亦（通部命令於昨日復航一節，實屬不確。據該公司負責人稱，並未接到是項命令，故昨今兩日飛出班機中均無載客。惟預料復航之期當已不遠，因此次停航以來，空中交通停滯已有一週，旅客極感不便，前往公司預先登記客位者甚爲擁擠，如再長期停航，將來必倍增困難。</p>

<p>裴元俊　供稱：丹陽人，業綢廠及人造絲，住林森西路大德里卅一號，該處房屋係民國卅一年八月向施兆光購得，時價僞幣廿四萬元，由一家住用。天井中花壇原來就有，雅片從何而來根本未知，但於民國卅二年四五月間，曾倔花匠周阿三，在花壇中種値天竺子時，周發現黑色柏油狀硬化物數塊，惟當時不識爲何物，故未深究，並稱：周阿三曾先後來過二次。</p>

<h3>上海汽車多已逾兩萬輛</h3>

<h3>太古碼頭工作爭執　市長親自高處　諭令組審查會　工頭周瑞蓀出言不遜　當被扣押送警局偵查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕太古公司碼頭工人爭奪工作糾紛，昨日中午由吳市長召集該公司碼頭倉庫經理陳善餘，工頭周瑞蓀及辦理該案之社會局人員，在市府會議室調處。陳善餘聲稱其所指揮監督之工頭小工，均係向在該公司碼頭服務之人，並非新雇。周瑞蓀並非太古公司工頭，與該公司旣未訂立承攬契約，亦無倔　僅關係，</p>
<p>故周之自稱老工人，似屬非是。周瑞蓀則堅稱在該碼頭服務多年，今要求其手下之一百餘工人，仍進碼頭工作。吳市長當表示此事可由社會局派員會同太古公司，碼頭工會及周瑞蓀等，組織一委員會共同調查甄別此批工人，如確屬老工人，則予登記後，可由陳善餘錄用分配工作。如係新工人，自不在此例。調處時周瑞蓀忽發題外之言，聲稱「陳善餘因有金條，遂有人帮同說話」。吳市長聞霄，極爲震怒，當下令將局瑞蓀扣押，備文送警局偵查，令其提出確實證據，否則不予釋放。</p>
<p>按太古公司碼頭爭奪工作，爭執已久。社會局於卅五年一月廿七日批示，內有令陳周二人合作之語。同年二月九日行政院宋院長諭社會局手令，誠恐發生糾紛，影響到滬物資，令社會局轉飭陳周兩人共同負責，防止竊盜。關於合作一點，諭內曾有「將來陳周兩人究竟能否合作，係另一問題」云云。</p>
<p>審查工作　一無結果</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕太古碼頭工作爭執，經吳市長諭令兩方組特查會甄別工人後，昨日下午三時許，社會局派調解科曹德模，諸變均二人，會同黃浦分局股長凌興吟，太古代表毛君，假太古公司寫字間進行審查工作。黃浦分局並派徐建中，宋永芳兩巡官率警員多人，到塲警備。工頭方面陳善餘亦出席。周瑞蓀因在市府調處時，出言不遜，詆毀政府官員，被市長下令扣送警局偵查。故審查會中，周方由周呈祥，孫文甫，侯孟芳，賀長志等代表出席。審查時陳善餘與周方代表侯孟芳，又發生爭執。侯堅持須雙方合作工作，工人不能歸陳收用。陳認爲侯之意見，完全推翻市長調處之本意，致局方工人不肯受審查，至五時許無結果而散。據社會局曹諸兩君稱，對於審查方式，須再請示市長。今日長否繼續審查，尙不能確定。</p>
<h3>大通論船公司　新舊工人爭執</h3>

<h3>小兒「痧子」</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>咳嗆爲痴子應有之證候，如咳聲不多，每間若千分鐘作咳三四聲，咳而帶潤呼吸調和，不妨礙其睡眠者，於康健上决無影響，於痧子之前途，亦决不致發生變化。咳嗆之生理作用，在排除呼吸系之障礙物，藉咳聲之迸發，驅出於體外：痴子咳嗆，且有輔助疹子透達之功能，茍不十分劇烈，有益而無害，不必投止咳之劑以消滅之。如咳嗆頻作，咳又不潤，或則因多咳而致咽喉辣痛，聲音啞澀，或則因劇咳而致胃部震動，泛惡作吐，在情勢上似覺甚爲緊張，然疹子之透發，並不因此而發生變化，呼吸均勻，無短促喘急之狀者，調治得法，尙無大礙。若咳嗆而氣急鼻煽，痧後仍頻咳不已者，皆屬逆證，宜深加注意！</p>
<p>感冒足以致咳，故患痧子者，宜避風寒，然過於謹護，或以重被緊裏病兒，或於房中添置火爐，外熱內迫，喘而作咳者，所見亦甚多。濃烟迷漫，最易刺激氣道，加甚其咳嗆。常見居室之狹隘者，多人聚處，空氣已十分惡濁，入其室，往往頭暈欲嘔，若再薰以濃烟，病兒咳嗆之劇者，益不宜採用此法。習俗；家中有發痧子者，烹飪時「不起油鑊」，即所以避免油味之刺激，防止咳嗆之加增也。</p>
<p>痧子之發生，多以感冒爲誘因，兼患咳者，以葱頭數枚，　碎，煮簿粥飲之，旣可解除感冒，亦能助痧子之外達，一舉而兩得也。若因熱而咳者，大多面紅氣促，脈象洪數，痴疹則密集而鮮紅甚艷，可用淸凉飲料，蔗漿，梨汁，皆爲合宜，視其熱勢之程度，而定冷飲與溫服，如以杏仁加水搗爛，取汁和飲，尤佳。熱甚則燥，津液耗灼，故因燥而咳者，乾咳不潤，兼見舌質光絳，投以甘凉之蔗漿梨汁，尤爲相宜。咳而多痰者，以袪痰爲要，萊菔搗汁，加萎汁三五滴溫服，如患痴子之小兒，大便溏泄，用時宜愼，咳而多痰者，不可多食油膩，在痧子前期，油膩固當禁止，即痧子後期，疹點已回，食慾驟增，其咳而多痰者，油膩之品，仍當禁止。</p>
<h3>哮吼·氣喘</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>近時氣候寒冷，最習見之病症，往往爲傷風感冒之類。重者或爲頑固咳嗽症（西名慢性氣管炎）。或爲氣喘吼哮症（西名氣管支喘息），皆非短期流行狀態。其人往往常時患之，痛苦特甚，欲求治愈，必長期留心治法：因人而異；因地而異；因業而異。故治愈此等頑固病症者，其自身經騐，亦有高於普通醫士之上！</p>
<p>幼年　氣喘·哮吼·喘息·哮喘·喘滿·喘促·皆是症也。一部份由於遺傳而得之，一部份由於受寒·肺弱·感染而得之。遺傳者最習見：恒有兄弟姊妹數人，雖輕重各異皆有此症。亦有僅一人得之，亦有間一代而得之。大凡父母有此症者，對於幼兒最須防其受寒，如劇發一次，則年年冬季即易發生。又須防止特異的氣味感受，如過食鹹鹵則爲『鹹哮』，食大量甜糖則爲「糖哮」，突受油氣烟燻氣管即感不舒乃成爲『油哮』，或因灰屑塵羽貼着氣管而致之，此皆幼時借因發作之態，尤以鹹哮油吼爲最多！父母有喘症者，宜爲兒女切避之！但油吼塵吼小兒初時服麻黄細辛易即愈，鹹吼小兒在三年內用蝸半南瓜蒂桑螵蛸吳茱萸等即愈皆騐方也！</p>
<p>幼年時治之較易，其最緊要之條件：爲起居須持一定之寒暖，冬季不能出門外，室內氣候以平均六十五度爲標準。故初發之第一二年，實有令其在家課讀之必要，若發過三年以上，則易成終身疾患，治之便不易矣。</p>
<p>中年　中年患氣喘者，其誘因如何已可不問。其求治之道，莫要於預防及急治初發。何爲預防？在夏季購老　約十斤，加水少許，搗汁，瀝出黄液一盂，又用棉花浸吸姜汁，曝乾，再吸薑汁。如是三次，即以此黄色棉花平舖，製成小棉襖背心各一件，入秋後擇一穿着，溫暖特異，能使肺部禦寒防喘，極有效力，此係經騐多人之方法也。</p>
<p>一入秋間，最防第一次秋風起時寒風直中肺部，喘息最易發，凡在深秋或初冬應即延醫服黄茋附子泡姜諸藥劑·以爲預防之用·一經受寒，應立即服麻黄細辛之藥劑，愈速愈佳，因多延一天，則痰涎水液汹湧而生，流入肺部。痰涎愈多則喘息愈甚，痰涎入肺，則呼吸循行不暢，哮喘者乃用以助呼吸，又用以鼓動痰涎，成爲氣泡狀態而使易於吐出，故日間喘咳往往吐痰數滿盂者，初皆氣泡如薄痰，過一夜則鎭靜而盡化成水液矣</p>
<p>哮喘最忌空氣不調節，旣不宜居極暖火爐屋中，更不宜偶然出門行於風雨之中。吳鐵城氏患血壓及哮喘症，避居滬上，坐玻璃棚下曝日取暖，眞良策也，待至春暖病即易痊。</p>
<p>哮吼愈時，皆由『熱化』而愈。薄痰成爲厚　，淸白痰成爲膠黄痰，一咯而能豁然吐出者，即離愈期不遠。故進服溫熱性藥劑，最易促其痊愈。</p>
<p>陳克恢博士發明麻黄製爲麻黄素，名噪全世界，頗收一時之效，全世界以爲治療良劑，然仍無根治藥品，惟中藥麻黄與附片葶蔴同用·實有根治之可能！（一）每冬第一次發作時儘量用之，頗可痊愈，愈後絕對須在家調節溫度，避寒避風，以待春暖來臨。第二年冬季及深秋初冷時仍須在　調節溫度，此事雖事實上不易遵行，但當知此　如染身三五年，則年年冬季必發一月二月，實　終身逢冬抱病之盧也。第一（二）年冬季發作後，一至春暖，即須服藥調治，加速治盡痰暖喘促，以防遷延成爲慢性氣管病症，使夏秋有續發之虞。</p>
<p>老年　高年之輩，氣血較爲衰弱，陽氣薄弱，所謂火氣漸漸不濟，猶之機器中之『發火』部份力量較少，全身皆感陽氣不足，　運之能力減少，推行之能力較微，所進飲食水　，往往因不能溫運，而氣管喘息，水份停聚，醞釀成痰。此種『痰』水，其性屬冷，吐出爲蟹沫狀白色有泡，吐出不久，下沉者皆爲水液。不吐出時則聚於肺胃，黏連不化，久而久之，愈積愈多，痰質愈積愈堅，竟成塊壘，醫學上亦名之爲『痰飲』，伏於肺部，經久不消。肺部吐納，失其健全，終日痰聲漉漉，吐之綿綿不絕，待至冬令，北風一起，外界之冷寒感受，水份愈無溫運之能力，生痰更多。略感風邪，即起咳嗽，更以痰涎中阻，氣機阻逆，故而作喘作哮，喉間痰　漉漉如『拉鋸聲』，然日中痰塊猶在胃或肺之下部，如於夜間臥平，則痰飲平舖肺胃上口，氣機更見逼塞，氣喘更甚，哮吼令人不能合目竟至不可平臥。又因高年陽氣衰微，若其人腎部素虧者，則有腎不納氣之狀，氣喘時急促不可名狀，丹田之氣，全無攝納能力，一若能使人上氣不接下氣之形勢。其痛苦誠不堪言，凡年達四十以上，一至冬日多有是症，其病病情百類上述，其病病源皆陽氣衰微，溫運無能，身中無火故耳！</p>
<p>治此病症全在『壯火溫陽』之法，止喘潤肺化痰平咳，皆非治療此症之根本方法。秋季宜進溫補藥品藥劑約廿劑，或常服『附子炒米粉』，以附子粉二兩炒米粉（即平常之米炒焦硏粉）八兩，和勻。病輕者分三十天服完，病重者分十四日服完，均每日服一次，或乾服，或開水調服，皆收非常效騐！除少年痰火喘咳向有吐血者以外，老年哮喘常服此粉，效騐如神。　一至冬季，再進服『壯火溫陽』之藥劑，就醫診治，求其訂立此類藥方，可服附子肉桂泡姜麻黃　蔴之屬，始能根本治此。否則逐年病根深種，愈發愈重，甚非所宜，惟如無力就醫服藥者，則中有『金　腎氣丸』一味，每日服三錢，亦有效力。</p>
<h3>中國藥</h3>
<p>— 岑志良</p>
<p>世界科學昌明，中國藥物至今爲國人所樂用，且能用銷國外，不受時代之淘汰，即因藥物功效卓著，不尙淺膚捷功取效一時，又善治兼夾複雜之病，及多方面相反混合之症，亦無　作用及劇烈　質，植物品多於礦物品，適國人之體格，富國裕民增進健康，提倡中國藥，實中國人之責也！</p>
<h3>戒煙之後</h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>勝利以來，煙禁森嚴，一般染有嗜好者。莫不以從速戒除，免受處罰，而作新民。但戒除之後，體反强壯者固多；孱弱之體，因之而發生疾病亦不少。人民以健康爲第一，煙民亦不能例外視之鄙人不揣護陋，謹將戒煙後之調理法。謹貢數言，以供採擇。戒煙之人。如屬陽虧之體，戒除之後，必見神經衰弱。盜汗夢遺，善忘多慮，宜常戒慮就醫，服多種補劑及桂圓蓮心湯之類。如屬陰虛之體。戒除之後，必見怔忡不寗。便秘不調。四肢疲軟。涕淚交流等。亦須就醫調治，常服鷄蛋。紅茶紅棗作點。亦有陰陽兩虛及特種症狀。更宜以中藥調理爲穩妥。戒除後半載中，調理得法方無後患。一般戒煙人，戒煙後，以酒代煙，每日酩酊，當時亦能發胖，但神經日益褒弱，結果必至腹部見大，或上見氣喘，或下成脾泄。或轉爲腎臟病症水腫臌脹等症不可不防。戒煙諸君。宜各注意及之。</p>
<h3>濕溫初起</h3>
<p>— 陳志超</p>
<p>濕溫初起，皆因飲食不愼，勞頓受寒而誘起，身熱惡寒無汗，頭痛身重，胸痞胃鈍，四肢怠倦，口膩苔白，渴不多飲，脈濡數。此時濕溫雖已形成，尙屬輕淺，茍能調理得宜，不久即能平復。如遷移誤事，或治不得法，或調理不週，則病勢增進，必成大患。</p>
<p>濕溫而重篤者，大多爲中下階級之人，或恃其體力之强，不加注意，或困於經濟，無力調理服藥，寒熱纏身依然勞作，養　貽患者比比是也。</p>
<p>濕溫初起。用藿香正氣湯（藿香·川朴·半夏·佩蘭·蘇葉·白芷·砂仁·廣皮·炒六粬·赤茯苓）加連翹·滑石·冬瓜子·通草·其脘悶腹滿，便瀉溺赤，表症惡寒未已者。用桂枝·藿香·佩蘭·川朴·木香·檳榔·赤苓·猪苓·滑石·以兩解表裏之邪。</p>
<h3>痧疹痘癍辨別</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>皮　之證狀，除色澤而外，最要都爲斑疹與浮腫。在習慣上，凡皮　表面發生有顏色之病態，統稱爲疹。茲爲醒目計，不論密集或稀疏之紅點，（如痳痧猩紅熱。）及圖整成顆粒（如天痘水痘）者，屬之於疹，其隆成塊，如豆瓣如雲片者，屬之於斑，茲列舉於下：</p>
<p>痳痧　痳痧即痧子出疹時，其熱復升高，發疹之部位，最初現於耳翼之後部，及顏面，口唇周圍，亦極顯著，次由胸背腹而四肢，依次發現，初爲稀疏紅點，而無根暈，狀似蚤咬，漸次稠密而透澈，稍帶紫紅色。</p>
<p>猩紅熱　猩紅熱發疹之時，熱度亦重復升高，留戀四五日而始退，發疹之順序，由頸部胸部背部腹部而臀部，一二日間，蔓延全身，顏面較少，鼻上，唇頤等部則絕無，初發時，皮膚尙有空隙，半日或一日後，漸次互相運合，大腿及上膊內側，密集尤甚，細視之，祗見徵小之點狀，其較稀之處，尚可認辨，極絀小如針頭而隆起之疹，一片紅色，有如丹毒。</p>
<p>風痧　風痧之證狀甚輕微，發熱同時發疹，亦有一二日後發者，呈小點，皮色紅，比猩紅疹大，比麻痧疹小，稍圓，或卵圓形，不比麻痧之隆起，又不若　紅熱之密　，初起見於頭部，半日或一日間，則傳佈全身。</p>
<p>天痘　天痘發疹後，體溫同時下降，其疹始發於前額部，鼻　及耳，次及面，漸及於背部　　上肢腹部，最後見於下肢足部，其特異之點，則爲腋窩部不發疹，初由小疹而速變成豌豆大，面圓形，潤澤有光。</p>
<h3>國大歸來感言</h3>
<p>— 丁仲英</p>
<p>余出席南京國民大會，各方參觀，確知國立醫學院及藥學院如雨後春笋，其所備敎材，悉屬歐美，對於吾國藥物方劑，百無一也，夫病有地方病地帶病及國情習慣症象，對於國家固有技能及治療材料，不加採擇，使醫學院之敎材，毫無國家性成分，殊非宜也。</p>

<h3>本地實銷旺外埠售價高　金價再漲三十餘萬　美鈔跟進港票亦起漲風</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕烚赤昨央行供源復少，買氣更熾，現創高價，午後稍加控制，略有回隆，　開四四三萬至四四五萬，獲利浮多，乘機脫手，即告下游，退入四四〇萬內，低價曾退至四三五萬，而後仍呈掙扎，十時後，央行以四三九萬之價，配給一一〇〇條後，買風再告發動，四四〇萬關，四五〇萬關，不久即告穿出，供方更形束手，壓力絕無僅有，人心大起恐慌爭買更亟，午刻更穿出四七〇萬大關，午後即交曾哄高至四八一萬而後稍回，二時正，隔日交劃開出，央行即加控制，曾回低至四六二萬，但賣氣甚暫，復回好至四七六萬，而後梢定，結果較前收再漲三十一萬，飾金掛四十九萬，銀元亦升至四關，暗拆息價尙平，自一角半至一角八左右。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦激烈上激，美鈔暗盤百晨開之七千九至八千一起，扶搖直上午刻達八千五至八千八高價，午後金價雖有回低，鈔市却無甚變化，結果較前收再漲七百元，港票亦起激烈買風，籌碼不多，自一五五〇元左右，盤高至一七〇〇元，結果亦漲一八〇元，港電匯躍升至一六〇〇元外，印匯一九五〇元，英匯二五六〇〇元，均屬有求無供。</p>
<h3>金業方面之觀察</h3>
<p>前昨兩日黃金飛漲，記者特走訪，某金業領袖，叩詢原因，據談：日來金市漲風，純由於實銷暢旺所致。而以裝運至外運至外埠者，爲數尤夥。據估計：自農曆年關迄今，市面每日成交之金條，恒在三四千條之譜。此中除一千一二百條，係各銀樓門市兌出外，其他大部流向外埠各地。而此大額金條之供給，十九皆係來自中央銀行。惟央行前昨兩日，除上午所配之一千餘外，下午極少拋售。昨日下午且全部停止拋售，然市面需胃亟殷，價遂扶搖直上。今後趨勢，仍須視市面之需求，及央行之供應情形而轉變云。</p>
<h3>公債徵升</h3>
<p>公債昨略形活動，成交約一百萬元，統丙一八六〇元，六〇四室有供而降至一七六〇元，五五二室則進，最後在一八二〇元至一八五〇元間徘徊，結果較前收　甲乙　平，統丙升三十元，統丁軋高一百元，統戊亦升五十元</p>
<h3>糖價漲勢轉勁</h3>
<p>靑赤白俱見上展，漲一萬七八千元至三四千元不一，公會劃盤現貨中砂白爲十五萬二千元，直至十五萬八千元，下午十六萬五千元，棧單最高爲十五萬三千元，後爲十四萬九千元，二四粗白二十一萬元，四半車白二十二萬五千元，三半軍白十八萬五千元，至十九萬元，順德靑十萬零四五千元，汕提靑十萬零六七八千元，枝赤十二萬五千元，共成交千數包，與化白十六萬元至十五萬五千元，陳興赤十三萬五千元計三百餘簍，刁靑百數十包，十萬零五千元。</p>
<h3>茶市人心堅挺</h3>
<p>邇來茶葉市况，趨勢頻呈俏利，至其原因，厥爲黃金與物價，掀起鉅大波動，人心亦跟蹤見挺，執貨者售意，莫不比前倍堅，供應遂轉凋零，買戶方面，除各出口行賡續前來問訊外，本街各莊鑒於近日門市去化尙稱蟬聯，亦復萌添納之意，是以過程漸露粥少僧多，不敷需求之局面，做開交易，寥若晨星，售價方面，則鋒铓愈甚。</p>
<h3>京市金價　五十出關</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕京市黃金出價五十萬零四千，入價四十六萬六千，美鈔出價八千五，入價八千四。</p>
<h3>英銀價减抵</h3>
<p>法國新聞社倫敦三日電，官方頃宣佈純銀官價已自每兩五十五·五辨士抑低至四十四辨士，據消息靈通人士談稱：英國當局採取此種措施，其目的乃在使英國銀價接近紐約之銀價，英國在戰時曾依照租借法案向美國借貸大量白銀，必須在今後數年內歸還云。</p>
<h3>配售展期金價漲　絲綢無不乘風翔</h3>
<p>昨市金價猛跳，絲綢價亦跟隨上升，無一不見新高價，人造絲一二〇號東洋有光上午做到四百十五萬元，迄午喊二十萬元，下午又高十萬元，高山等上午做四百零五萬元，下午喉二十萬元，一五零號有光及七五半光竟喊到六百萬元，尙不肯脫手，昨因金價刺激，塲內人心異常振奮，更因中央信託局第二十一期配售展期以致乘機高抬扶搖直上，廠經因實銷有限市况比較緩和，C級喊價五百五十五萬元，D級五百五十萬元此上日喊大五萬至十萬元之左，干經五担討價四百二十萬元，另担討價四百萬元，成交寥寥無幾，綢貨受原料高漲影響，交易頗形活躍，故廠盤均已提高，美亞被面最大喊四十萬元，三十五萬元有成交，大誠格鑒縐一萬三千五百元，雜牌做二千五百元有交易，人絲被面大起五萬元，盛杭各貨，俱亦提高，盛貨每疋的漲起二三千元至五千元，杭貨每兩大二百元。</p>
<h3>央行貝總裁　昨奉召晋京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，於昨日中午十二時卅分奉召，匆匆於一時卅分晋京。同行有行政院經濟顯問羅傑士，及秘書盧定中等。此行任務未明，惟衆信輿穩定目前滬市經濟金融有關。</p>
<h3>輸出推廣委員會　改開預備會議</h3>
<p>正式成立之日期　待貝氏返滬決定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會原定昨日下午三時三十分，在中央銀行召開成立會議。旋以主委員祖詒臨時晋京，故暫改爲預備會議。到劉攻芸，林鳳苞，沈熙瑞，金士宣（交通部參事），馬保之（農林都司長），嚴家淦（台灣省財政處長），張似旅，及央行經濟顧問麥克等，討論至六時許散會。據悉：會中談話，着重如何與晨林交通兩部，取得合作。一方面增加輸出品之生產，一方面謀交通運輸問題之解決。至正式成立會議，尙待主委貝祖飴返滬後，方能決定云。</p>
<h3>食油聯配處　分區配售食油</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海食油聯配處，昨起開始辦理甫市，淸東，及郊區食油配售事宜。據估計：各配售區所魔這零售店，在四百家以上。每家仍配豆蔴油各一桶，每桶三百五十斤。總配售量約在三千担以上。配售價格，豆油每担十八萬元，蔴油每担十六萬五千元。今日配售手續，可望辦理竟事。又悉：昨日中央信託局曾平價拋售東北大豆二千担，故豆價止漲，油價亦趨穩定云。</p>
<h3>大量拋售嚴格監督後　米市已漸趨平定　超越限價商號均受警告　雜糧油餅市况亦漸疲軟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日食米價格高漲，社會局派員往各區視察，並在南北市塲監督交易，惟因一月十日之議價與黑市價格相去甚遠，且農曆新年後食米運滬者數量極微，故一般米商，皆特貨不放，徐社會局拋售之秈米外，塲內幾無交易，各米店多將白粳暗藏，不願供應，黑市價格仍盤旋於九萬關左右，販戶有乘高吐售者，價格已略見回跌，一般預料本市米價已達高峯，各產米區食米即將大批擁到，且中國糧食公司所撥大量國米，已由無錫起運，日內即將在本市拋售，故食米價格，日內可望回平云。</p>
<p>社會局昨繼續在市場拋出暹米三千四百三十包，及大豆八百餘包。並在各區查得超過議價之經售商號共達五十二家之多，由吉科長於下午五時携帶該項違反議價之經售商號名册，往市府請示市長，作何處置，事後吳市長吿記者稱：據米商聲述，該項白粳多係在暹米未拋售前，以黑市高價購進者，故情有可原，但已向彼等作最後一次警吿，自今日起，如再經查出有超過議價情形，定予嚴辦。</p>
<p>昨日米市南北共到五百四十餘石，社會局照常配售暹米，店胃冷淡，白元陰元回挫二三千元，場外粳米亦下跌四五千元，秈米仍少市價，粉市人心不振，略帶軟化，麩皮貨稀仍挺，再升五六百至千元，油市亦軟化，生油回小二三千元，豆油仍跌，菜油淸油廠方供源不斷，明定暗疲，豆餅受主甚稀，成交寥寥，市趨下游，黃豆因中糧公司配售東北大豆，頓形呆滯，回跌一二千元，杜豆平疲，蠶豆相仿，菉豆少神，苞米亦下降一二千元，惟紅糧貨少尙定，芝蔴浙方去胃活潑，價漲三四千元，生仁高定次削。</p>
<h3>華南帮收羅現貨　紗市復創新高價</h3>
<p>昨日紗市漲風仍熾，因粵價又吿上升，重磅雙馬現貨在華南帮收羅下，復創三百四十五萬之新高價，普通念支紗亦跟漲念萬，十六支紗尤爲俏利，現貨奇缺，價已駕乎念支之上，四十二支雙股綫有棉織廠布廠吸吶，狂升四十萬，人心挺秀，趨勢仍昂。</p>
<p>棉紡業鉅子談紗漲原因</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據棉紡業某領袖語記者：日來棉紗騰漲，分析原因：（一）係發行新版關金券，餘波未盡。（二）係各地紗價報漲，此中尤以香港一地爲最。據昨日香港來電，該地廿支特雙馬市價，已達五百六十萬元。而原有日本運港之棉紗，雖按議價配售，惟香港最近對棉織品之出口，業已開放。而南洋各地需要孔股，故棉織品輸出暢旺，港地棉紗，遂成供不應求。故又轉向廣州等地搜羅，華南各地棉紗價格，遂又吿普遍上漲。</p>
<h3>坯布飛升　色布挺秀</h3>
<p>布市自社會局棉布價格審議會調整價格後，益見瘋狂，昨市白坯根子異常緊俏，良以染織廠收購彌般，色布又以本街門市實銷旺動，各方搜求返力，全日間價格上升相差懸殊，復以各大紗廠之放出白坯額子大爲軋缺。紡建公司今日掛牌唯陽鶴及龍頭二等品二種，價爲十一萬八千元，但終未能饜衆人之望也。</p>
<h3>紗布南運限制　院令暫緩變更</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於輸往華南紗布管制出口，前市商會等以紗布旣已恢復自由賣買，乃函請紡管會要求取消南運限制，紡管會據情向行政院請示，茲悉政院批示，業已到滬，着令暫緩變更，故本月份紗布南運，該會仍照常辦理，將於本星期四例會核定後，即可通知廠商報運。</p>
<h3>嗶嘰京銷大暢</h3>
<p>六萬餘元一碼之美國藏靑嗶嘰，近來甚形暢銷，南京客帮頗有進胃，先後由建華轉運公司運去七八百碼，據云薄素嗶嘰開價太昂，一般顧客均改選斯料，本街諸西服裁縫帮有鹽於此，因之亦互有配進，造成同業中賣買驟轉暢盛，其他交易亦被帶上不少。</p>
<h3>煤市漲風未戢</h3>
<p>烟煤又創新價</p>
<p>煤市烟煤各貨供者微細，需者急迫，賣戶討價扶搖直上，成交價極爲紊亂，市塲雖數量謠傳，配煤即日核准，然終因遠水不救近火，市况愈形緊俏，白煤行市雖略呈平穩，趨勢亦極堅挺，唯柴炭因受平價煤球影響，市勢尙形平定。</p>
<h3>中國石油公司向英訂購原油</h3>
<p>中國石油公司近因國內石油原料缺乏，特向英國英伊石油公司訂購原油數百萬桶，每桶價値僅美金二元，第一批五千九百三十七噸，聞已裝載完竣，首途來滬，約於本月中旬即可到滬。該公司接得此批原油後，全部運往台灣煉油廠煉裝，除以大部份製成汽油外，其餘或製成煤油及柴油運銷各地。</p>
<h3>美國火油汽油即將大批運到</h3>

<h3>埠際隊在港第三戰　再受挫於港軍聯</h3>
<p>陣綫配置失當遭逢意外慘敗</p>
<p>〔香港航訊〕上海埠際足球隊第三次比賽，在銅鑼灣畔對抗香港海陸空軍聯隊時，因爲幷非假期，故參觀人數，遠不及正式埠際賽時擁擠。比賽於下午四時開幕，上海隊因隊長李義臣足傷未上陣，改由賈幼良代理隊長職，擇位時，軍聯擇守背山向海順風一方，勞勃斯托夫脚下起風雲，九十分鐘的賽程便開始角逐，軍聯人選一如預吿，上海隊因仍用鐔福楨當中堅，却使絕好的中堅大將宋靈聖，改串左輔，右翼竟臨時指用一無是處之卡洛列區而不用韓龍海，於是便有以下陣容</p>
<p>軍聯</p>
<p>飽維路</p>
<p>格林尼　阿伯拉罕</p>
<p>晏打臣　茄殊文　堪布路</p>
<p>福特　恤治　高路托　史荻蘭　赫基</p>
<p>上海</p>
<p>張邦綸</p>
<p>曼亞　吳祺祥</p>
<p>韓龍彼　鐔福楨　高保正</p>
<p>李壵　朱夢聖　勞勃斯托夫　卡洛列區　賈幼良</p>
<p>大出意外　此次上海隊因沙却孫錦順與嚴士鑫隨軍，實力上根本已打了折扣，再加上李義臣脚腫不能登塲，攻力自然受到影響，倘昨日仍用韓龍海和羅壽福當輔鋒，而用宋靈聖充正中衛，則攻守兩力或尙不致加昨日之不濟事，而輸與軍聯，要知現在香港軍聯人物，在看球人眼中，咸視爲尙有未及星島或南華單一隊之實力。昨日上海隊竟不能勝，無怪賽後衆口同聲，咸謂太出意料之外。</p>
<p>李壵首中　昨日的射球過程，是上海隊屢被急攻之後，於賽去八分鐘時，忽然一陣反攻，由宋靈聖得球欲射，詎出脚射偏，球斜滾向左方，被李垚切入，時勞勃斯托夫亦衝至剛掩在阿伯罕與飽維路之間，留得空隙，任李垚認門射入。</p>
<p>各一和局　再開賽軍聯又復大舉反攻，賽至十二分鐘時，由史荻闌近門斜射，球兒過人頭，横進滬門網右之內方，此球殊令張邦綸無法抵擋，上半時遂成一對一和局。</p>
<p>又失一球　下半時雙方互有攻守，軍聯並未如上半時之佔盡上風，距料賽至八分鐘時，赫基忽然得機，盤球入中央直進，鐔福楨苦追不及，眼看其迫近球門，射球入網，軍聯便以二對一佔勝。</p>
<p>罰十二碼　比時雙方俱只有硬打硬的演出，無甚美妙技術可見，直戰至差八分鐘完塲時，鐔福楨即被傍證搖旗指爲禁區內犯規十二碼球，由軍聯左後衛格林尼遠出主踢，一針見血，滬隊遂以一比三失敗終塲。</p>
<p>三記角球　昨日之最足令人注意者，厥爲甚少角球，計上半時雙方俱未踢過角球，下半時始見軍聯先負角球一記，滬隊兩記，全塲只有三記角球，由此可見雙方門前，均未嘗有若何大緊張之鏡頭。</p>
<h3>昨晚籃球聯賽　華聯大勝全黑隊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕二屆籃球聯賽，昨晚原有三塲，第二塲甲一組印第安棄權予華陽，故僅餘二塲。首幕女子組，强華輕取力隊，末塲華聯大勝全黑。戰况如下：</p>
<p>强華輕取力隊　首幕女子組强華逢力隊，力隊顧麗情首罰得分，惜僅曇花一現，强華曹曼麗，曹曼媞，黄峻三人鼎足三分天下，分數扶搖直上，首節以十比一佔先，前半時十四比一，强華佔光。易陣再戰，曹家班更見猖獗，力隊僅陳文琰罰入一分，第三節卅二比二。節力隊陳文琰一投一罰，扳回三分，結果强華以五十八比五大勝力隊。</p>
<p>華聯攻勢猛烈　壓軸大戰，華聯與全黑登塲角逐，全黑人馬賽前僅到塲五人，氣勢先敗。笛聲響後，包松岡首得罰中，全黑獲分之　張少鄉連擲帶罰突得三分，華聯全陣馬之一動，遂加緊攻勢。陣學崇二罰皆中，老包又梅開二度，全黑李祖德回敬一球，十比四華聯佔先。華聯張良雄再擲，全黑徐菊生巧中空心籃，華聯呼停，脫去絨衣，十足必勝之勢，進逼益緊。全黑阿張雖數度衝刺，奈獨木難支，前半時十四比廿五，華聯先導。</p>
<p>全黑一籌莫展　易陣交鋒，全黑陸大振趕來參戰，易出李祖德，然全黑自知不敵，戰來頗有玩戲情形，失球更加累累，華聯阿弟亦登塲，陳學崇暫退休。任相成梅開二度，阿弟更添錦上之花，四十一比十四，全黑一籌莫展。張少卿急中生智，旁敲側擊，連中二元，陳學崇再度臨陣，易出鬆懈之老包，氣燄遂盛極一時。李震中塲外吸烟，孔廣益微笑觀戰，天下定矣，最後四分鐘時，六十比卅，華聯得分，倍於全黑，最後結果，六十四比三十九。</p>
<h3>足球友誼賽　鐵路戰合羣</h3>

<h3>在青濟特快車中</h3>
<p>— 濟南二十四日航訊　本報特派員麗天</p>
<p>膠濟鐵路　全綫行（四）</p>
<p>由青島回濟南，記者所乘的是自本月六日起才加開的青濟直達特快車。此項特快，每天對開一次。九日晨七時廿五分，車開前，先在車內往來兜了一個圈子，發現此項特快的車廂乃係　　升格改造而成。以前的三等升格為二等，二等升格為頭等，車廂升了級，旅客降了格。可是就車內其他設置及招待之週到而言，比較兩路的金陵號和錢塘號，是在是有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>記者因為在青島停留的時間委實太短促，錯過了參觀路局所附設的國內第二大機廠—四方機廠的機會，補救的辦法，只得於車開後，請路局總務處周處長文欽介紹了同車的該局機務處潘處長世甯為記者補充說明了該廠的大概情形。</p>
<p>四方機廠　自造機車</p>
<p>據潘處長談：全國機廠中能自製機車（即火車頭）者，除潘陽機車製造廠外，就是這四方機廠。全廠共有機器九五〇架，技術工人一八〇〇名，內一三〇〇名係　有，五百人為後方復員回來的。在日人管理期間，曾一度停止製造，專事修理，我自於前年十一月接受後，因浦鎮，濟南，天津三修理廠担任津浦區鐵路修理業務已綽有餘裕，而四方機廠旣原有製造能力，加以敵方於交下時內中鋼鐵成品甚多，故決廣搜材料，從事創製，迄今已造成機車兩輛，第三輛則定於月內完工。如以資委會接取之潘陽機車製造廠不事修理僅事製造一年來僅完成機車一輛之情形觀之，則四方機廠之工作效率實高出多多。潘處長又談：當接受之初，任用日技術人員甚多，現已全部改用國人，足見沒有外國人，國人亦可單獨担負起重工業的製造任務來。</p>
<p>本年計劃　出品估計</p>
<p>該廠本年度計劃製造機車九輛，客車廿四輛，貨車二四〇輛，攻擊約需要三八〇億元。按照該廠現有設備，如材料及技術人員補足，每月僅機車一項，即可製五輛，一年為六十輛。如按目下全國鐵路共有機車一五〇〇輛計，每年即可補充廿五分之一。年來膠濟津浦路所用軍廂，多係西方廠該修而成。修路所用魚尾板，道釘等，亦係四方出品。</p>
<p>提早開車　當天即到</p>
<p>潘處長剛把四方機廠介紹終了，同車中，便有人問到濟南站開車時間，較之青島為何特別提前一時廿五分而于晨六時即開出，致使若干乘客為了戒嚴趕不上車。對于這點，周處長代為回答說：這完全是爲了顧到旅客的安全，因為靠近青島之城陽至高密一帶，共軍活動較烈，破路較多，所以自青島西開特快車定點時，不得不在天明以後的七時廿五分。同樣的，自濟東開車，爲了要于天黑前趕過城陽，于是濟南的開車時間，又不得不提早至天尚未明的上午六時。因為共軍目下在光天化日下尚不敢公開破路，而多利用黑夜行之。路局為顧及旅客便利，除已更改可于光一日購票定座外，也就是只有使濟南的旅客于上車時起個早，多辛苦一點了！周處長又說：青濟間共三九二公里，普通快車，要走兩天，和約十七小時，（晚間停開），現在特快車只走十三小時，當天可到，自然已比較進步得多了。</p>
<p>鋼軌被毀　當夜搶修</p>
<p>車于九時廿九分至膠縣，十時廿分至高密，都能如規定時間準時到達。但車至高密西二站的蔡家莊，原來規定不停的一個小站，突然倒停下來，並且停得特別久。我最初不明白，後來看到若干旅客已下車去，于是也就跟着下車。在這被破壞得找不到一所完整屋子的站上，站長正在訴說着停車的原委。原來就在這裏前面的塔爾堡，丈嶺及太保莊之間，於昨晚十一時後被千餘共軍炸燬了共軌五處，共四十九根，另有十米鋼橋一座，亦被炸燬。等到護路軍警聽到炸聲，馳往兜剿時，共軍已向鐵路以南的雙羊店逃走了！所毀鋼軌，路局于當夜即派工程車搶修完工。現在是因鋼橋尚未竣工，故不得不略事等待。</p>
<p>共軍做夢　圖覆快車</p>
<p>站長又說：共軍的原意本來就在顛覆這一列特別快車，但他這個企圖顯然是失敗了！</p>
<p>橋樑于十一時廿分才修竣，共軍使我們在車上多逗留了卅二分鐘。當列車駛經被破壞處時，我還看到許多被炸燬的鋼軌及鋼橋，支離破碎地棄置路旁。若干被毀的電桿磁瓶，在陽光反射下，尚不時發出零亂的閃耀。</p>
<p>路局困難　入不敷出</p>
<p>兩點十分，車過濰縣，根據統計，這裏以西出事較少，大家的心情也沒有上午那麼來得緊張了。在這期間，路局負責人又告訴我：路局目下實際的困難時（一）入不敷出：膠濟綫如欲完全恢復戰前狀態，至少尚需二五〇億。這筆錢那裏來？即就目下收支狀況言，每月都要透支卅億左右。（二）材料困難：無論是枕木，鋼軌，機車，以至電訊設備，沒一樣不缺乏。無錢固不談，就是有了錢也不易買。本路現共客車三五〇輛，貨車二千餘輛，目下尚勉可　用，但如津浦路修通後，可就成大問題了。</p>
<p>鐵路人才　極感缺乏</p>
<p>（三）人才缺乏：鐵路方面所需要的大部為專門技術人才，敵偽時代訓練的，都只知其一，尤其中下級幹部最缺乏，交大華業生又　不濟急，希望各大學能多設鐵道管理系或鐵道管理專修科。（四）根本的也是最大的困難，是共軍無止境　破路，「破壞容易建設難」，希望共軍要拿出些良心來，大家要以國計民生為專，修壞路實比建新路要吃力得多。</p>
<p>四方暢達　聯語幽默</p>
<p>火車終於晚八時四十分平安地到達濟南站。記者於步出車站時，目擊着路局為慶祝元旦所紥的松柏綵牌還沒有拆除，若干自青島初來旅客正在念着綵牌上面這副幽默的聯語：</p>
<p>空運陸行，四方暢達；</p>
<p>春回景好，萬物昭蘇。</p>
<h3>工商新趨勢　各國推進日用品</h3>
<p>— 廿六日萊汀航訊　本報特約記者王一之</p>
<p>俄國最新經濟政策，乃係推進日用消費品Consumers'Goods之生產量所謂日用消費品，即指人民所必需之衣食用具而言。預計一九四七廿之俄工業製造能力，可成五十萬張之床，四千噸（即四百萬公斤）之廚房器皿，値價二百五十兆洽慮布之木器，五百萬雙之滑雪鞋，二千三百萬雙男女不同之襪，一千三百五十萬雙之革履。統核全俄一百五十兆之人口，平均每十人之中，僅至一人可得新革履，羊毛及棉料之針織衫一千三百萬件，似亦每滿十人，僅可分得一件衣衫，聞必待至一九五〇年，俄國方可完成大規模之國有鞋襪工業，彼時可望造成二百四十兆雙之鞋，五百八十兆雙之男女襪，分配全國，才見裕如。現今一九四六年開始以逮一九五〇年之第四期「五年計劃」，特致力於食物及日用品各工業之擴張，但其發達進行，均不能如鋼鐵化學品諸工業之銳速，直至一九五〇年，恐尚不能恢復戰前原狀，蓋今俄國版與，已視一九四〇年加大不少，人口亦復激增，按照第四期五年計劃預定之步程，必其牲畜之繁殖，麥糧，棉花，亞麻（Flax）等農產品之收成，能使一九五〇年所可倖得之數，比照一九四〇年之元產額，各加若干成，原料無　，乃便多造，此則半由人事，半任天然，屆時是否如願以償，自非今日所能逆料。</p>

<p>復興工業　掃除恐慌</p>
<p>工業國自力完成之製造品其售價誠哉低廉，然苟從又一方面，作返映之觀察，人民旣忙於工業，每不　兼顧農耕，工業品價廉之國，其農產品之價　加昂，或其本國農產苦不足，動須仰求於海外，則在太平洋之年，如我地大民衆之中華，從事製造，工價雖比他國為廉，而為民食根本問題之五穀，或仍需購自他國，若被他國窺破此弱點，一且來源中絕，國內即苦飢荒，迨入戰爭之年，則國外交通，忽焉阻絕，偶缺非所必須之工業品，人民猶可以為生，獨農產則萬不可缺。天下無論若何荒與若何亂，農戶居鄉，總易足食，中國則萊飯布服，已慶飽暖之兼全，而苦力在大城市圖生存，乏食啼飢，却至慘痛。力農為百務之先，足食乃安民要策。中國地大民衆略如俄，國人茍言與工業，自以獎進「日用消費品」之製造為最有利，因此為國之大本，時時待添購，日日有銷塲，最不易發生失業恐慌，他如美容不可少之奢侈品，使人少年化之運動用具，以及　巧爭奇之　發明器材，盡可適應人類天性之需求起共友邦交換我方此不可少之保僑通商諸權益，使概由外洋　人，例如　式家庭所價備之無綫電廣播器，或　掃地拂灰兩　用之吸塵機，旣已購到一具，　經五年十年以上之長期，亦可不必再易　　，假令此等物悉由本國自造，則如上文所言新發明器材奢侈品或運動用具，不必時時添購，又不必日日有消場者，却最易因製造過多，隨時引起衆之恐慌。</p>
<p>細工美兿　急起直追</p>
<p>我國工業知識尚幼稚，何必冒此甚大之風險哉？予意我中國人民之尚忠勇，好和平，在歐洲各國中求之，又略似與世無爭之瑞士，中國人擅長雕刻，刺繡，瓷漆器，口玩等細工美藝，又絕類瑞士人質愛製鐘錶，及擅農事餘暇之木刻小玩藝。昔者日本奸商，窺破歐美各方歡迎中國貨之心理，以偽亂真，冒混牟利，思之可恨，言之可傷。而今冒名「中國製」之劣貨，在歐美各都市，幸告蕭清，我國永可自居不敗。立場之細工美藝，旣與歐美諸友邦機器製造之新發明新事物，毫無衝突，自宜急診此時，順勢直進，兼使與此細工美藝相關之海外商販，成為推廣國貨銷路之津梁，此則我中華隊個小國締商約交換對等權益之一種小小希望，簡而易行，輕而易舉者也。</p>
<p>安民要策　力農足食</p>
<p>其毗於西洋化者特大之投資，有如巴西之咖啡，古巴之糖，新嘉坡之橡膠，非無大利之可稱快一時，惟皆係單調農產（Mono-agriculture），偶遇他國農產突起之競爭，極易演成失業　本閑飢荒等慘劇。我國地大物博優於俄，而絕似歐洲之法，及美洲之合衆國，生路甚廣，自可不至因貪利而誤人入迷途。顧亭林有言曰：天下亂則民衆於城，天下治則民散於野，足食為安民要策，力農乃百務之先，國人如有現款，謀向海外求機器，自宜先取足以廣農利與與水利者，購之用之，次則取其足以加大農產，足以推進日用消費品工業之器而購之用之，如此進行，旣以充實國力，又便補裨民生，此諸侈言建立新工業者無選擇無計劃之歧路亡羊，不度德不量力之盲從逐鹿，至少當有十倍以上之把握，可斷言也。</p>

<h3>美政府要人　掛冠求去　造成嚴重問題</h3>
<p>— 溪譯自美國「新新聞週」雜誌</p>
<p>最近美國政府要員先後請求辭職者，頗不乏人：巴羅克和他的幹練的同僚已經辭去聯合國原子能委員會主席及委員職務；梅攸和史密斯已經辭去國際銀行總裁及副總裁；維南特已經辭去聯合國經濟社會理事會美方代表；貝爾納斯已辭去國務卿職務文契遜行將辭去副國務卿職務；李海海軍上將行將辭去美總統參謀長職務。</p>
<p>美國政府在過去數星期中已經失去了幾個才具超特的人材如魏耶特和濮爾德，而去年一年中更喪失了許多學騐俱富的青年。</p>
<p>這一大批人物的出走大大地削弱了公務的效率。偏狹的共和黨員對此不但不感到憂慮，反而覺得：（一）若干人因不信任杜魯門的前途而辭職；（二）政府行政部門　的退化將使一九四八年共和黨的前途更可樂觀。</p>
<p>艾契遜</p>
<p>不過當一個第一流人物下野時，尤其子啊不能覓得能力相埓的替身時，對於整個國家華竟是一種損失。如果大批第一流人物同事掛冠而去，那損失就更大了。其所造成的後果是國家行政效率低落，整個政府或若干部門可能因此而解體。國家有　趨退化的危險。</p>
<p>大批的政府要員相率辭去國際公職，的確造成很嚴重的問題。其中黨人也有幾位年事較高的政治家，其出任要職本來是暫時性質的；巴羅克·梅攸和李海等都屬於這一類的人物。他們去職以後，不容易找到適當的　任者。杜魯門總統至今沒有請到有責任的人士　　　出任國際銀行總裁。</p>
<p>巴羅克</p>
<p>代理國務卿支契生即將辭職一事，當爲美政府的又一重大損失。在國務卿貝爾納斯出席國際會議期間，他始終代行着國務卿職務。雖然權力有限，人手不夠，但艾氏竭力設法使國務卿團結一致，保持美國的一貫政策。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統時常以不能羅致第一流人物為苦，同時他對於已經得到的優秀人物似乎也不能竭力維繫。維耶特就是一個例子。他是一個智力和精力都很充沛的人物，他的辭職確是公家的一大損失。</p>
<p>在許多辭職的原因中，至少有一個因素美國國會可以而且應該加以矯正的。那便是薪俸的微薄。美國官俸去年雖曾提高過，但是和工商界領袖的薪俸比較起來，還很低微。多數第一流的政府要人，除非擁有私產，大都覺得担任國家公職有難以為　之苦。</p>
<h3>徘徊於美蘇之間的　今日之瑞典</h3>
<p>— （奚水譯自美國「生活」雜誌）</p>
<p>瑞典可以算得是全世界最美國化的一個國家了。這雖不是一種新的發展，但是瑞典美國化的傾向日甚一日，尤其在戰事結束以後，瑞典須大量仰結於進口的美貨。瑞典全部進口貨中，百分之三十來自美國，美國汽車在瑞典到處可以見到，大都是一九四六年式，也有一九四七年式的。</p>
<p>從戈登堡到各小市鎭和村莊，瑞士的每條大街都可以稱做美國的大街。首都斯德哥爾摩的商店裏充塞着美國貨，有些事在美國不易購得的。那裏有美國肥皂，保安剃刀和刀片，罐頭食物，食品雜貨，橡皮糖，無綫電，電燈泡，以及打火機，太陽眼鏡，自來水筆等日用品。其中若干種貨物須憑配給證購買，例如肥皂一塊。而且價格往往奇昂到使人不敢問津。一包普通的美國香烟售價二克羅諾又物質，約合美金七角。一隻美國無綫電的價格兩倍於美國的市價，一枝美國自來水筆價格要貴到兩倍以上。</p>
<p>在表面上瑞典似乎是美國化的，一般民意是極端親美的，但是瑞典政府正領導着全國向着蘇聯的政治路綫走法。瑞典政府最近和蘇聯締結一種貿易與信用貸款協定，有瑞典給於蘇聯十億克羅諾信用貸款，專為購買瑞典貨之用，瑞典民衆大都認為這是瑞典外交政策的一個嚴重的轉捩點。政府發言人儘管無論說：現已喪失德國市場的瑞典，為什麽不應和蘇聯往來貿易，像和西方民主國家一樣，可是瑞典人民亟欲知道：作為一個小國的瑞典為什麽要借給蘇聯十億克羅諾的鉅大貸款，和全國的財富比較起來，這是一個不堪負擔的數字，美國已經借給他的戰時盟友英國約四十億。但瑞典的人說：蘇聯並不是瑞典的盟國。在斯德哥爾摩的公園裏，正對着王宮前面建立着國王查理十二世的人像，他是瑞典的拿破崙，曾於十八世紀初　和俄國人打過仗。他一隻手按着劍柄，另一隻手高舉着。瑞典人曾告訴你，他的手是指向莫斯科的。</p>
<p>蘇瑞商約的後果是不難預料的。蘇聯的商人或政府代理人將和瑞典工業冢發生接觸，瑞典的工業，必須加以擴充，以便充分履行商約的條款。蘇聯代表已經在準備着移入斯德哥爾摩；蘇聯公使已經佔有富麗寬大的前日本使館。現任總理歐蘭德原為教育部長，本來並沒有升任現職的野心，不過現在旣經擔任了這職位，他是決心以大學教授的認眞的態度來負起他的責任。當然他不可能推翻他所已經承受下來的政策，但是筆者相信他將竭力使瑞典回復到「中庸之道」。</p>
<p>時事評述</p>
<h3>英國外交的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>從今年一月開始，英國的外交就顯示出活躍的姿態；一方面是英法同盟，經過法國前任內閣總理勃魯姆的訪問英倫之後，業已具體化，盟約不就即可簽字成立；另一方面是英蘇關係，在英國參謀長蒙帥作莫斯科之行後，顯已大見好轉，瑞士報紙並盛傳　，英蘇已成立秘密協定，劃分兩國在歐洲及近東的勢力範圍。在表面上看來，英國的外交似乎十分順利，且已獲得相當的成功；但是按之實際，英國外交家的苦悶。却與日俱深。</p>
<p>關於英法締結同盟，在英法兩國固然沒有問題，但是蘇聯的態度如何？却有重大的關係。在英法看來，英法盟約可以補充英蘇條約與法蘇條約的不足，並可促成英法蘇三角關係；和第一次大戰以前的英法協商相同；蘇聯自不致表示異議，但據蘇聯最近的表示，蘇聯對於英法締盟約意向，尚未能完全消除戒心。英國如何謀得蘇聯的諒解？仍有待英國外交當局的繼續努力。</p>
<p>其次關於英蘇關係，英國雖有取得蘇聯好感的誠意，但是在蘇聯方面，是否眞正願意與英國保持着親密關係？至少目前，還是一個嚴重的問題。例如蘇聯廣播電台於上月廿八日廣播塔斯社的消息，曾公然指摘英國現所探取對蘇聯政策，與英蘇盟約的精神，不　背道而馳。同時蘇聯報紙對於英軍留駐阿比西尼亞，又大肆攻擊，一時還不能具體化。而且此外我們還覺得，英國是外交界雖然老謀深算，但終不及蘇聯外交家的縱橫捭闔。</p>
<p>在最近一個月來，我們看得非常清楚，蘇聯對於英國的態度，確已有了　變，不像過去處處與英國為難，專門抓住了希臘問題伊朗問題以及西班牙問題，攻擊英國的外交政策危害世界和平。但是蘇聯對英態度的轉變，是否另有作用？確實是一個疑問。在這最近一月內，蘇聯對於對於美國的態度，依然如故，而且蘇聯宣傳攻勢處處以美國為對象，不是攻擊美國採取原子外交，就是大罵美國企圖　斷原子能。在這裏很可以看出一種微妙的作用，蘇聯對於英美顯已採取分化政策，在分量權衡，蘇聯對待美英已有親疏之分的趨勢。回想起大戰爆發之前，納粹德國的外交政策不是親英反法嗎？日本對英美政策，也不是親美疏英嗎？所以蘇聯的眞正意向何在？英國實在還有些把握不住！</p>
<p>此外，戰後英國最感棘手的巴勒斯坦問題，經過兩年來的紛擾，流血與恐怖，聖地現已成為黑暗的地獄，，局勢的嚴重，有增無減，使英國政府不得不令英國的婦孺撤退回國，同時在倫敦舉行的巴勒斯坦問題圓桌會議，不僅沒有解決巴勒斯坦問題的希望，而且猶太復國運動頭領，始終拒絕參加會議。。預料將來的結果，倫敦圓桌會議必蹈去年九月間的覆轍，，又將再告失敗，使英國不得不將此項問題訴諸聯合國大會了。</p>
<p>要之，道是英國外交當局的苦悶，同時也是戰後世界的煩惱。</p>
<h3>蘇聯的檢查制度　自古已然·於今為烈</h3>
<p>— 佐譯自美國Newsweek</p>
<p>遠在一八八五年，有一位叫做佐治肯南的美國作家，從西伯里亞遊歷蹄來，爲了一冊書名「西伯里亞與放逐制度」的巨著，書中對於供給他情報的許多人的姓名隻字不提，特在序言裏表明他的苦衷道：「這許多人我甚至連姓名也不敢提起。他們的品格和貢獻雖然値得紀念，値得崇敬，可是他們不幸生長於俄國，那裏的政府把坦白的意見認為，不可靠的事物，把革新的努力當做一種罪惡看待。」</p>
<p>凡遊歷過蘇聯的人，都知道這類古書所描述的基本特徵，至今還沒有改變。蘇聯對檢查制度所抱的嚴峻的態度始終沒有改變。他們對外籍新聞記者監視甚嚴，斷絕情報來源，使報導之搜　極感困難。官方對待外籍記者的粗暴態度，引起美國對蘇聯發生不愉快的印象。</p>
<p>蘇聯何以存在着這些情形呢？我的解釋如下：第一，蘇聯對檢查制度所抱的態度，不過是歐洲各國所抱一般態度之趨於極端者罷了。在英美兩國以外的各國，政府有統治人民思想的權力和責任，差不多是普遍的一種傳統觀念。就這方面而論，蘇聯共產黨革命算不得是一種革命。培育蘇聯革命精神的前　如費兒巴黑，赫爾森，巴可寗，培林斯基以至列寗和史達林，他們所領導的無非都是智識階級的革命。在他們的概念中，所謂「人民」不過是被支配着被領導着的烏合之衆而已。即使把馬克斯和恩格爾　入革命先烈華中，也不能絲毫改變這基本的蘇聯細想典型。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於外國人所懷的猜疑心理，祗是一種想保守秘密的傾向罷了，讀了歷史和遊記一類的書，竟不能斷定這種猜疑心理在蘇聯政府下比較在俄皇時代更強烈些。上文所提起的那位佐治肯南，若非事前在紐約美國地理協會中發表過演說，擁護俄國對待政治犯的方法，俄國當局決不能容許他在西伯里亞的放逐地從容遊歷的。</p>
<p>如果你以為這種猜疑祗限於莫斯科一地，那就錯誤了。原來這是一種普遍的現象。旅行家即使隨身携带莫斯科的護照，但到處仍會受着地方官吏的猜忌。</p>
<p>這種態度決不是史達林所特創的，在歷代的俄國人性格中早已孕育着了。所以，我們儘管勸告蘇聯當局改變此種態度，但是結果反增加了他們對我們的猜疑。</p>

<h3>韃峽</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰後，土耳其之百萬國防軍隊迄今未復員，更且加緊戒備各車略據點，其原因除其近鄰各國（如希臘·伊朗等）內政多故，頗多武裝衝突，恐受影響外，而其視作生命綫之韃峽，受強鄰覬覦為最大因素。</p>
<p>韃靼尼爾海峽（Dardanells）屬土耳其，為黑海各國出地中海之必經要道，素為國際間所重視，首次世界大戰時，土耳其因加入同盟國作戰失敗，協約國遂對土訂立洛桑條約，規定海峽兩岸不得配置要塞及軍隊，以後土耳其要求廢棄此項不平等條約，一九三六年再與英·法·蘇·日·希·南·羅·保等國在瑞士蒙德　簽訂公約，撤銷若干限制，但規定土耳其不得封鎖韃峽，土信守此約至今。自去年起，蘇聯　次對土提出照會，要求蘇土共管海峽，蘇此舉似欲摒棄蒙德　公約，關係各國當加反對，蓋蘇聯過於重視一己之安全與主權而侵犯他國之安全與主權故也。</p>
<p>第二次大戰後，英美蘇三強間關係始終未能充分協調，韃峽之新地位如何，未可逆料。英國曾提出召集蒙德　簽約各國會議，而以美國代替日本，俾商海峽前途之建議，　蘇聯政策最近已在蛻變，較前略趨溫和，但對海峽問題是否亦願妥協尚難斷言。</p>

<h3>託爾斯泰的晚年</h3>
<p>— 克同</p>
<p>俄國文豪託爾斯泰在世界文壇上有着光輝的成就和不朽的價値，這是衆所週知的。他在晚年思想上轉變很大。這轉變在「安娜·卡列尼娜」脫稿之前已漸露朕兆，到該書出版的一八七七年或七八十年代之交他開始感覺到一種內在的轉變，追求着比現實更眞誠的更有精神價値的生活，一直到他死時他還始終堅持着這種意圖。他和他妻多年愉快情愛的生涯因此轉變而終結。</p>
<p>在託翁思想轉變的初期，他然烈地探究正教的教義，想在教堂內找得思想的出路。他以爲宗教是一般民衆所信仰的。他或許可以從此使他更能認識民衆。但他的探究終成失望，他因此對正教又漸漸棄去。在這時期，他對於家庭是日形疏遠了，對於子女可以說絕不過問，偶然的衝動會使他對妻子厭惡。加以在四年之內，他述遭五件喪事。他對於生活的不滿和眞理的追求日形熱烈，我們讀過他的「懺悔錄」或其他著作，就知道他的追求無滿意的結果，時而有脫離家庭出走和自殺的企圖。他追求對於上帝的信仰，故時而去和包勃林斯基伯爵談論英國傳教師拉特期篤克的說教，時而訪摯友S.S.烏魯索夫商討正教會的信仰，時而和遊方的信士問題，時而向教士神父請益。然而沒有一個人物，沒有一項義理可以滿足他的願望，而使他復歸寗靜！在他自已精神頹喪萎謝之際，對現存的宗敎，文明的進步，科學，家庭及數百年人類進化所蓄積着的一種極端反抗抬起頭來。他內心所見者好像都屬於姦惡困苦之一面，而一切可喜可愛的事物都消滅無蹤了。</p>
<p>託翁雖於正敎及敎堂立於反對地位，但他承認耶穌的說教爲有價値的聖言，他以爲前者與後者實相矛盾。託翁對宗教的無謂的儀式最爲反對，他力求將福音書應用於實際的生活，我的信仰第四章基督說敎之誤解中說：「大概說來，人們對於差督的說教，有着種種不同的解釋，但是言辭中自然流露着的直接的與簡單的含義，却無人注意到，他循基督的教養，進而應用到實際的人生。託翁的說敎，最注意於個人的解放，希圖以各個的改悔來拆毀整個的惡社會。我的信仰第三章上帝的律條與人間的律條中說：「基督的律條總是使我感動和歡喜的。但是，在每一方面歷史的傳統與我現處的環境，自已的生活，另一種律條管轄着我們。這雖和我的天良及理智不能融洽，但與我的獸性倒是相介。我覺得假使我接受了基督的律條，我將與一般人異趣，將如督所斷定的那樣受人殘害爲人責難。但使假我接受了人間的律條，我可以爲一切人的贊成，可得到平靜安定的生活。種種神學上的微言奧義可供我引證，以賺得良心的安慰，亦如基督所說，我可以歡笑而快樂。我認識這種情形，因此不敢追究上帝的律條爲何物。我只把它曲解着，只　繼續其獸性的生活」。</p>
<p>一八八四年，託翁有一次想帶着一個田間工作的農婦私逃，和農民們同去閒拓新的生活，但終究未行。又有一次託翁爲了馬匹和他奏發生齟　，他檢點些隨身的物件，　上包爽，離家而行，自已稱說要到美洲去，再也不　回來，次日早晨四點鐘，他終於不忍而回家了。一八九七年託翁又立意要走。沒有一個人知道他的秘必，也寫下一封信給他妻，但到底那一次的計劃也未實現。由此可見，他晚年思想上的轉變，已使他與家庭間劃了一條不可挽救的鴻溝，一直到他去世。偉大的心靈要去追求眞理，其心切於愛情。</p>
<p>一八九一年及其後二年，託翁參加救濟災民的工作，起初他是如意了，但後來則猶以爲未足，他更想向着更進一步的自我犧性的行爲。一八九五年間，他最幼的兒子凡宜區加去世。這對於託翁是一個莫大的打擊。此後，他與家庭間最末的一節鎖練脫斷了，種下了一八九七年出走遠因（這次如上所述，沒有眞正出走）。凡宜區加死去以後，慢慢地長成的子女逐個結婚，相率離去，家庭顯得異常寂靜冷淡，託翁的健康亦呈不良的狀態，一九〇一年九月遵醫遷居南方克里米亞，在那裏居住十月，他的健康絕無進步，反而變本加厲了以後他離開人世，大概到另一世界去找尋眞理了罷。</p>
<h3>雲</h3>
<p>— 鄭昭</p>
<p>雲，詩人們放逐雲感的天國，農人門看作是春天孵芽的喜訊；航海的老舵手，偶面見洋面　來一朶雲，他會想着，該有一陣風吧，東風，南風，抑是西北風。</p>
<p>我愛雲，愛它像汹湧的波濤，力拔千鈞似的排山倒海而來，這氣魄是多麼雄偉。我愛雲，愛他是細想底美麗底千荀百巧的狀形，引起我的遐念產。我愛雲，不論是晴空澄碧，鑲上的朵朵白雲，也不論是夕陽黃昏，五彩鮮艷的雲。</p>
<p>雲的象徵是清新的，幻覺的，也是解脫的。仔細的看，仔細的想，它，可代表人生，人生就像雲。</p>
<p>雲的個性，是天眞的，無邪的，沒有虛偽和做作。它怨怒了，拉下陰沈刻版的臉，它快樂了，會伸伸腿，擺擺腰，頭枕在南山，脚擱在北谷。它也會跳獅舞，玩龍燈，高興時，來上一個康茄舞。</p>
<p>天宇是雲的家，雲是天宇的主宰·天宇沒有了雲，就沒有了變化，沒有風，雨，閃電，光光剩一個至高無上獨裁的太陽。然而，萬物會因之枯萎，人間就沒有哲學家，詩人，萬古不朽的史詩，轟烈哀泣的傳奇，宇宙雖不失色，但是已失去了靈魂。雲是偉大的雲是賜予人類享受的神。</p>
<p>挹鬰渚，可以得到安慰；樂觀者，可以發抒抱負；老年人，看了雲怡情，中年人看了雲達觀。小孩們看了雲，拍着小手，踏着脚，會叫着，唱着「雲伯伯，你的閃娘娘呢？」</p>
<p>雲有時風情初解，有時孤芳自賞，有時深夜幽泣，有時登高噓嘯。若少女，孤　，　士，逐巨，盡形像於風雲變化之中。</p>
<p>而我之愛雲，因爲雲像我的母親。彷彿與以溫曖。</p>
<h3>談詩片</h3>
<p>— 胡訥</p>
<p>詩不是綺麗的詞藻堆砌而成的，詩也不能以外形的漂亮而決定詩的優劣；好的詩，不是詞藻的綺麗，而是內容的豐富，充實，最要緊，詩不能和現實脫離。</p>
<p>所以，詩不是詩人個人心底呼喊，而是大衆生活的共嗚！</p>
<p>詩人是大衆的先知者，是光耀的明燈，能喚醒沉睡着的世人，能照亮不透明的現實。</p>
<p>詩，不是雅人的消遣品，詩，是現實的反光鏡。</p>
<p>詩是生命的泉源，詩能帶給人以勇氣。</p>

<p>揚州居民，家裏有了婚喪喜慶，前來討乞的很多，這和各地是一樣。在這討乞的羣體中，佔有特殊地位的，第一要數寒生，這使不是各地皆有了。這些寒生，以數目說，沒有其他喊老爺太太的人多。以資格說，又多是智識份子。更以服裝說，儘管鞋機不全，髮寗甚長，總還穿上一件長衫。穿畏衫，像無形的變成了寒生特有標識。至於多是智識份子，正好說明他們原也不是下賤之輩，却因行爲不檢，侖客至比。因比，其數目自然不多了。</p>
<p>他們之間，似乎有個無形組織。某家有喜事，某家有喪事，都調查得很淸楚，並且彼此都能知道。有人說，他們和專管送帖的所謂「傳事稟」，以及臨時巷人家帮忙的所謂「帮价」互通聲氣，想來是不錯的。他們到人家去，並非空手，總是帶一份薄禮。主人對於這份禮物，能退必退，還得重重的送一筆「敬使」的錢。這一筆「敬使」的錢，不論多少，他們總得要爭多嫌少，而對於一些暴發戶以及門第不甚淸白的，那就爭得格外厲害，如是不遂所欲，他們會在門口大聲急呼，揭發主人不願宣揚的隱私，藉以要挾。結果，多由賬房或帮价出來調停，加添幾文了事。不過，總還是欲取先予，比之空手討乞，自然高雅得多，因而寒生的地位，也就遠在一般乞丐之上了</p>
<p>寒生的家世過去都是很好的。他們的祖或父旣做過官，也發過財，他們在幼年時，誰不錦衣玉食，有的捐過官，頂戴花翎，坐過綠呢大轎。有的遠涉重洋，精通外語。更有的能詩善畫，吐屬風雅。可是他們却皆是癮君子，先是雅片，後是紅丸乃至白麵，便使他們終日的滯留在吞雲吐霧的世界中。到了一切財產變了雅片，紅丸以及白麵被自己服用盡了以後，於是便老着臉改業寒生了。</p>
<p>做寒生要論家世，自然不會大最的多起來，他們因爲過去門第很好，自不少身價還好的親故。因此，他們不但到那有婚喪喜慶的人家去變相的討乞，還進出各茶社，向親故們「吿帮」。「老姻長！小侄今天實在不能混了，請你老帮帮忙」，「　哥　小弟請　哥的安，今天無論如何請帮帮忙」！這類話，在過去我們會時常從茶社裏聽到。說話的就是寒生，站在桌子的一邊。那些「老姻長」以及「　哥」們被糾纏不淸，結果唯有破費，。就抗戰以前說，對乞丐可以祗給幾個銅子，而對他們至少也得要給兩角錢。等到他們嫌少爭多，計較多時，走了以後，老姻長們會搖頭嘆息：「唉！不學好的東西，把他祖上的險都丟盡了」！其實這班寒生們對於本身都沒有好的打算，還念到什麼祖上呢！祗是有一點，他們的話說得很文雅，如「君子固窮」「富貴於我如浮雲」……這都是口頭禪，藉此使得別人知道他們確係書香門第。倘使他們的祖上有知，也可慰情聊勝無了！</p>
<p>王逋的「蚓庵瑣話」上說：「明萬曆中天寗寺富僧物故，凡往弔者厚有贈貽，各曰程儀，司鄉鍾姓者效之。有諸生丘某者，形體類侏儒人稱之爲丘的篤，與死者素不相識，利其贈金，備禮往弔，句日數往。喪主訝而問曰：『先人存日，未嘗見公往來』？丘日：『死的肚裏自知』！聞者絕倒。自後民家婚喪，必往賀弔，出俟於門，遣僕入促，甚至索添錙銖，往返數次，廉恥掃地，丐者不如。丘死而傳其衣缽者皆故家子弟，潦倒無聊之徒，猶以斯文自居。至今此風不變。民間遇見此輩軏稱之爲丘的篤云。崑山有喪蟲亦此類」這裏所談的丘的篤，似乎比寒生要高雅些，因爲他還能有個僕役跟隨着。不過就是這些不甚高雅的寒生，在近十年來死去的已經很多。繼起的素質逐漸低落，什麼門第，什麼智識，再也難談，和一般的乞丐，看去已沒有什麼較大的距離了。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　159</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「海參崴……哈哈……海參崴早已是日本囊中之物了，那裏算得蘇聯的據點？」</p>
<p>「行，就說赤塔的話罷。」我催促鶴見說下去。</p>
<p>「赤塔旣是蘇聯鐵道最後據點，日人就把這個據點，當作對蘇第一秘密站的前站。而眞正活動的前站，乃是哈爾演，或稱濱江的那個地方。</p>
<p>「佈置方面如何？」</p>
<p>「那是軍事行動，，知雙方間諜活動的大戰塲；都在利用白俄。」</p>
<p>「這才八個秘密站之一哪，還有呢？」我有些怕他嚕囌了。</p>
<p>「哼……又是一個塔，名叫塔城；恐怕您更有些信不及，不是嗎？那是前站，正站却是我們貴國的迪化！支站是綏定。」</p>
<p>「好，我相信；還有呢？」</p>
<p>「這是對付蘇聯的。對付付美國的，正站在馬尼刺，前站遠在檀香山的希羅；對英有雪梨，香港，新嘉坡，加爾各答；對法或英法共同的是仰光和海防。因要凑成「八」的數目，所以香港和海防只算一個混合站，便衣和小綫派得相常多，主持人却只一名。」</p>
<p>「也許道就是萍子所謂一八的秘密？」」我給他把這一層揣則，作了一個小小結束。</p>
<p>「也許沒有這麼簡單吧。」</p>
<p>我們剛要繼續研究下去，忽地聽得門上響了兩下，門鈕一動，停了約莫一秒鐘工夫，門開處，只見「〇四」走了進來，手上拿着一密碼電訊：</p>
<p>「報吿，四點十二分收到。」</p>
<p>鶴見　通那張密碼，只溜了一眼，便向地上一據：</p>
<p>「混蛋！」鶴見似乎發了脾汽。我知道鶴見素來不肯如此任性，他的性情，雖不十分溫和，却能忍耐，從不如此疾顏厲色，尤其在手下們面前。這回想是在東京失敗，又被萍子經得無法解脫，竟把脾汽弄得暴躁起來。他這一叱喝，倒無關係，「〇四」還當自己說錯了鐘點，嚇得木呆呆地站在當地。</p>
<p>我剛想叫「〇四」退出，鶴見却又縱聲狂笑起來，一伸手拍了「〇四」肩頭一下，「好朋友，不關您的事，快去聽着點，怕還有電訊來。」邊說邊將「〇四」送到門外，還給他來了一個鞠躬。</p>
<p>我把電訊拾起一瞧，見是東京發來，照秘碼看，很簡單的寫着；</p>
<p>「支密，注意『八』，「〇五一三一。」</p>
<p>鶴見把我手中電訊拿過去，又瞧了一遍，瞧得那麼用力，好像那張電碼紙，藏着什麼特殊秘密似的：</p>
<p>「八……」鶴見把這個字重又沉着地念了一遍，「老大哥，我想這並非　電，定是「〇五」單獨發來的，也許是他個人，從本部探聽到的消息，認爲重要，所以特地通知我們，可又爲什慶如此簡單呢？」</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>指痕斑斑，罪證俱在。　趁火打劫之徒法綱難逃！</h3>
<p>……談「指紋」與破案……</p>
<p>在調查罪行時，指紋被認爲是最有力的佐證，最近西摩路大火調查委員會，也已在被劈衣櫥上發現了指印，認爲是最公正，也是最有把握的證據，預料這般爲非作歹之徒，頭顱難保！這裏且介紹給你一些關於指紋的常識：</p>
<p>許多人都以爲指紋可以代表一個人的個性，但指紋專家並不是命理專家，他只想在指紋中找尋犯罪的證據。不過，有經騐的指紋家，有時確能從指紋上，猜出其人的性別，身材，和一般性的職業。但其所根據的。也不過經騐而已。譬如：錢條約粗細，可以決定性別；皮膚的摺縐和瘢疤，可以決定年齡；整個紋形的大小，可以決定身材；至於職業，則某幾種工作的性質，確能在指紋上顯露出來。</p>
<p>指紋的分類</p>
<p>在美國聯邦偵查局中，存有一億零五十萬張指紋卡，足可代表六千萬人。而他們在接到某一指紋卡時，在三十六小時內，甚至幾分鐘內，就可決定他們的存案中，有沒有相同的一張。這看上去似乎不可能，但如果我們知道他們的分類方法，也就不覺驚奇了。</p>
<p>指紋的種類，一共祗有七種：釵形，弧形，尖弧形，螺形，中釵形，雙釵形，還有一種是由上面六種中兩秈或兩種以上合起來的形狀。最常見的是釵形，好似許多套在一起而向同一方向（普通向小指）灣曲的髮釵，次之爲螺形，由許多同心橢圓合成，或像鐘錶的發條。還有弧形，則其綫條中央凸起而向兩邊分開。</p>
<p>這採，分類工作就不難完成，先把所有的指紋卡，就其相似分爲若干組，每組再分若干小組，如是不斷地分，直至每一單位剩了幾十萬張時爲止。</p>
<p>但是每一單位中的指紋，並不絕對相同。因爲世界祗有一個人，有你一樣的指紋；而這個人就是你自已。</p>
<p>那末，怎樣區別相似的指紋呢？這就要案近乎細則的小地方，但雖是細則，却極重要。如果有八項細則與某一指紋吻合，且入項間之關係亦復相同，則身份證明在法律上已算成立，這些細則包括：指邊春狀綫，不規則圓圈，點子，枝叉形綫等。</p>
<p>所以，在法庭上，指紋家至少須備二張放大的指紋照；一張屬於受害者，一張得自犯罪塲所。每張上相同的細則，都用相同的數字，在旁邊註明。這樣，法呂祗須察看同樣數字的細則，是否相同，就可決定受審者是無辜，或有罪了。</p>
<p>造物的大智</p>
<p>至於爲什麼我們所接觸過的東西上，都會毫不費力地留下我們的指紋呢？那就不得不佩服萬能自然的大智了。</p>
<p>如果你細察一張放大的指紋照（或用手指醮了自粉，然後輕輕地揩去），你就能發現很多白色的點子，分佈在綫條上。這些點子就是汗腺的出口，從這裏面出來的汗液，正是天生的，最好的，手指上複雜橡皮印的打印水！更妙的是這些汗腺在神經緊張時，會加速分泌汗液，使所留指紋更爲淸晰，譬如說，在犯罪的時候！</p>
<p>但因汗液是無色的，所以指紋都不是用肉眼可以看得見的；必需用別的物質使它顯示出來，由於科學的進步，我們已有很多方法，用來顯示和保存指紋。</p>
<p>最普通的方法，是用粉質，在緊急的時候，幾乎任何細潔的粉類都可拿來一用，香粉，麵粉，香烟灰等都行，但要得到最好的効果，就要用特製的粉了。</p>
<p>碘的蒸氣，也常被使用，當結晶的碘受熱時，就有紫色的蒸氣產生，而這氣體遇着看不見的指紋時，便因化學反應而把指紋顯示出來；但所留的時問很短，必須立即攝入鏡頭。</p>
<p>攝取指紋的照相機很像普通大型照相機，在鏡頭前裝有一平頭圓錐形透鏡。攝取時，把這透鏡平的一頭貼住所欲攝的目的物，再撳下光圈就行了。當光圈開啓時，鏡箱中電池同時自動發光，使指紋分外淸晰。</p>
<p>指紋也可因需要而移走，透明的賽璐珞帶（上海也有出售），或薄的橡皮衣均可應用，用時把帶子均勻地貼在醮了粉的指紋上，然後輕輕地把帶子褐去，指紋就留在帶子上了。</p>
<p>普通犯罪塲所所得到的指紋，祗有幾個，但偵查局中所用的分類法是根據十個手指的，所以在聯邦偵查局或別的機構有時也不能決定一個或幾個指紋的主人，即使他在局中有了存案，除非他是巨匪大盜，那末局中才用另一種分類法，根據每一手指來分類。</p>
<p>人人留指印</p>
<p>所以，如果你有嫌疑犯和指紋，那就很容易決定指紋是不是屬於嫌疑犯，但若祗有指紋而沒有嫌疑犯，那你就不能找到犯罪的人了。</p>
<p>於是有人提義全世界每一個人都應捺指紋存案，如果這一旦質行了，那末在防禦罪行和間諜工作上，要便利得多了。（節譯十月號科學文摘）</p>

<p>去年元夜時，</p>
<p>勝利剛到手；</p>

<p>處處鷄尾酒。</p>
<p>今年元夜時，</p>

<h3>火樹銀花如昨歲，兵荒馬亂鬧元宵！</h3>
<p>— 蕭宂石</p>
<p>唐詩人道元夕詩云：「火樹銀花合，星橋鐵鎖開；暗鹿隨馬去，明月逐人來。遊妓皆穠李，行歌盡落梅；金吾不禁夜，玉漏草相催」！這首詩寫元宵盛况，有無限的旖旎風光，而環顧今日江南各地，在元宵晚上，張燈慶賀，仍將一如昨歲，羅鼓喧天，滿充着一種歌舞昇平異的氣象！</p>
<p>但我們看着江南以外的「烽火」，「砲花」，「兵荒馬亂」，噢着「火藥氣味」，一羣羣的流亡，到處飄萍，眞感到無限的「痛心」！正是：「火樹銀花如昨歲，兵荒馬亂鬧元宵」</p>
<h3>雞蛋直立與立春有關嗎？</h3>
<p>— 駿志</p>
<p>據這幾天報載：立春時鷄蛋能直立，一中國在美科學家將當衆表演云云。</p>
<p>在二日晚八時半（決不是立春時問）我在無意中講述這一件事，並且我拿一個朋友的話來證明——他曾經在去年立春時豎直二個鷄蛋——於是。賭博開始了。隔了五分鐘，一個鷄蛋開始在桌面上直立了。這啓了我的疑賓，但是事實擺明在限前。</p>
<p>這是怎麼一回事？回答是物理作用。大家總會知道物理上的話：「物體之重心之垂直錢在物體支面之內則不倒下，否則便倒下。」所以鷄蛋之能直立是恰巧適合以上之條件。「物體穩定之條件：一，重心低，重心愈低則物體愈穩定。二，支面廣；支面愈廣則物體愈穩定。」故鷄蛋直立之機會少（僅大小頭各一點。）由於支面狹小；大頭直立之機會多於小頭，是因爲重心高低的緣故。至於直立與季節，我想完全是無關的。</p>
<p>諸位賢明讀者不妨試試看，大概一定不會失望的！但不必定在立春的時候。</p>
<h3>看看人家·想想自己　春到人間話旅行</h3>
<p>— 忠祈</p>
<p>談美人假期旅行生活</p>
<p>一九四七年中，據專家估計，美國將有六千萬人舉行假期旅行，美國人願意消費大量的金錢於此種奢侈的旅行，今年的遊客用於運輸，食物，旅館，土產紀念品，攝影軟片，行李，衣服等各項的總數約一百萬萬元美金。十萬萬元用於增進各種交通工具的效用：鐵道，飛行綫，公路和航海綫都極共便利的通至各地；車輛，旅館，停車塲，海邊浴塲等都經過了修飾；處處破壞的和過時的設備都換上了最新的。</p>
<p>本年度旅行者駕駛私人汽水於公路上的將佔淤多數，使美國的公路更形擁擠，形形色色的汽車在廣闊的公路上排列成行，蔚爲奇觀。但是，當局却非常關切着他們的安全而發出警吿：「如果你的汽車沒有把握保持安全的話，留它在家裏吧。」</p>
<p>乘民航機的旅客也很多，新型的飛機着力於快速和容量DC－8型飛機就是適應這種需要所產生的，內部的設備高貴華麗，而且它有每小時三百哩的速率，節省旅客的時間。茶些航空公司備有夜航機，內有舒適座位和舖位，通風設備完全，光綫充足。</p>
<p>公共汽車解決了很多人的旅行困難，今年，數千輛的新式公共汽車加入服務，車身大且輕（鋁製），活動性極大。坐公共汽車的旅費很低，所以頗受一般人的歡迎，尤其是集團旅行者。</p>
<p>火車除了速率不及飛機外，兼有其他各類交通工日的長處，如車資低廉。宜於長距離旅行，發生意外事件的可能性極少等等。火車中的設備也極盡奢侈的能事，坐於車座內與家內的起居室相若，臥室媲美高等旅館，餐間服務雖普通飯店也不能及。</p>
<p>中國人的旅行，利用汽車（包括私人及公共汽車）似不可能，因公路設備不完善，沿途欠安全。飛機旅行因最近連續失事，已具戒心。火車旅行說來可憐，除京滬，滬杭兩路外（擁擠不堪），其餘的都給人「扒」得寸寸斷了。</p>
<p>春光明媚，烽烟處處，中國的人民，可想到旅行？</p>

On the morning of the 4th, the National Army entered Zaozhuang and is now coordinating with the National Army in Tancheng, Pixian, and Taierzhuang to gradually tighten the encirclement of the communist troops in southern Shandong. The communist troops are extremely panicked, and internal chaos is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 4th] Li Xiannian's communist troops have recently moved out of northern Hubei, launching an attack on eastern Hubei in an attempt to coordinate with Liu Bocheng's troops in southwestern Shandong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hefei, 4th] More than 20,000 of Liu Bocheng's communist troops launched a fierce attack on Boxian from Zhecheng in eastern Henan on the 1st. After the local militia fought all night, the city was captured at 1:00 AM on the 3rd. A unit of about 4,000 to 5,000 fled to Feihekou, appearing to continue eastward along both banks of the Wo River.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 4th] The front line in southern Shandong has turned into a stalemate. The National Army is continuing to deploy security operations in the northern suburbs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] (1) The communist troops are actively attempting to cut off transportation between Xuzhou and Bian. On the 3rd, they gathered three brigades and launched another attack between Liuhe and Xiaoba. After being severely attacked by the National Army, they were completely defeated. The National Army is now advancing towards Xiaoba. (2) Boxian in northern Anhui was besieged on the 3rd by the main force of the communist 6th Column and a part of the 7th Column, along with Zhang Taisheng, Wei Feng's 8,000 men. The National Army withdrew from the city that day. The communist troops then launched a fierce attack on areas west of Boxian, such as Ding Dazhuang, Weizhuang, and Qi Dasi, failing three times and suffering heavy casualties.

<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 4th] The National Army in Taierzhuang recovered Chahe, 35 li east of the city, at noon on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 4th] Shandong Province has gradually entered a state of full-scale war. The situation in southern Shandong has turned in favor of the National Army. The senior command of the communist troops in Linyi has entered the mountains. Linyi is almost an empty city. The communist troops in the vicinity are actively mobilizing their main force, and a decisive battle is not far off. Most counties in western Shandong have fallen into the hands of the communist troops. Fierce fighting is still ongoing near Heze. The number of communist troops around Jinan is gradually increasing. A large number of communist troops north of the Yancheng Railway are gathering at Dafuying, 18 li west of Qihe. A major battle near Qihe is feared to be unavoidable. The communist troops on the Jiaoji Railway are constantly destroying the railway, but it is still operating as usual. However, the communist troops on both sides are dispatching troops day and night, and the eve of a major battle has arrived. The National Army is making every effort to ensure the safety of Jinan, Qingdao, and the Jiaoji Railway. All parties have great confidence in General Wang Yaowu, so the people are very at peace. The situation in Yanzhou and Jining is stable.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 4th] In order to coordinate with the battle in southern Shandong, the National Army in central Shandong advanced to Maozizhuang and Xiaoyi, more than ten kilometers northeast of Laiwu, on the morning of the 4th, and had their first contact with 3,000 to 4,000 communist troops this year.

As of noon on the 4th, the National Army's vanguard had reached the outskirts of Laiwu.</p>
<h3>Our Strength is Solid in Baoding; The Communist Army's Offensive Is Unlikely to Succeed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 4th] (1) The Independent 8th Brigade of the communist troops, led by Wei Hongliang, who previously attacked Nandaran, south of Baoding, was defeated by our defending troops.

<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 4th] After the communist troops captured Dingxian, the railway between Xinle and Wangdu was once again completely destroyed. Today, the communist troops are constantly attacking Xushui, attempting to extend their reach and once again destroy the Pingbao transportation, isolating Baoding. People here are very concerned about the Pingbao transportation. According to responsible authorities, the National Army's strength in the Pingbao section is solid, and the communist troops are unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 4th] A locomotive was blown up by a mine between Xushui and Gucheng on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway this morning. The Pingbao train was temporarily transferred there. There were no changes in Shijiazhuang today.</p>
<h3>Sheng Shicai's Impeachment Case; Sent to the Ministry of National Defense for Review; Accomplices Will Be Sent to Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 4th] In Sheng Shicai's impeachment case, the Control Yuan believed that it involved too many people and should be submitted to the Disciplinary Committee and the Supreme Procuratorate at the same time. It is reported that the latest response has arrived. Sheng himself, as an active-duty military officer who has not retired, has been sent to the Ministry of National Defense for review. More than 20 other accomplices will be sent to the court for handling.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops on the Jinpu Railway; Attempt to Attack Cangxian</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 4th] (1) In the vicinity of Cangxian on the Jinpu Railway, a large number of communist troops have been besieging Cangxian for days. Four regiments have been discovered in Dahezhuang, ten li west of the city. Three thousand troops have arrived in Qijiawu Luzhuzhuang in the northeast. Three thousand troops have arrived in Xiaojizhen and Qilidian east of the city. More than fifty people have arrived in Gaotanzhen. (2) The railway near the Xibozizhan station on the Pingsui Railway was destroyed by the communist troops last night, and trains are still not running.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Once Occupied; Beining Railway Taizhen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 4th] Taizhen on the Beining Railway between Tianjin and Tangshan was besieged by communist troops last night. The town fell into the hands of the communist troops by 4:00 AM this morning. Around 8:00 AM, reinforcements arrived, and the communist troops retreated. The station is intact. More than 30 meters of the railway between Taizhen has been destroyed, but it has been quickly repaired. Train traffic between Beiping and Tianjin has returned to normal today. A unit of more than 3,000 communist troops who disrupted the Pingjin Railway is now in the area of Dongxigucheng and Hancheng southwest of Langfang.</p>
<h3>General He Yingqin and Ambassador Gu; Visited Marshall Together; He Said the Chinese Civil War Would Not Become Fierce</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun, and General He Yingqin, the Chinese representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, visited Secretary of State Marshall today. Reporters wanted to know if this visit had anything to do with Marshall's recent statement that he was giving up mediation. However, Gu and He insisted that this trip was only a courtesy visit and had nothing to do with international politics. General He Yingqin told reporters: He believes that after the United States withdraws personnel from the Executive Headquarters, the Chinese civil war will not become more intense as a result. He believes that the most intense period of the Chinese war was the battle of Changchun last year. He expressed doubts as to whether the subsequent civil war would be as intense as the "Battle of Changchun". He estimated that the current number of government troops is about 150 divisions, with a wartime maximum of 300 divisions, but their strength would not decrease since reorganization.</p>
<h3>Call a Four-Power Conference; Resolve the China Stalemate; Proposed by a US Congressman</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Congressman Mansfield, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, delivered a speech in the House today, calling on President Truman to convene a four-power conference to resolve the Chinese civil war. Mansfield proposed that Truman invite representatives from China, Britain, and the Soviet Union to jointly resolve the stalemate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party with the United States. Mansfield said: "This four-power conference, used to discuss the complex situation in China, may be able to formulate a solution to strengthen and unify the organization of China, to help China restore its position as one of the great powers. If world peace is to be maintained, then the stalemate in China must be resolved."</p>

<h3>The State Department is Considering; Lawsuits from American Businessmen in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The State Department recently stated that it is considering the complaints from American businessmen in China about China's suffocating import restrictions and commercial scandals. It is reported that American businessmen in China have also filed complaints with the US Treasury Department and asked for an investigation. American businessmen accuse China of discriminatory and favoritist behavior in implementing the new import control regulations, and of using political pressure to try to exclude American businessmen. The State Department is currently unwilling to say whether there are many such complaints, so the United States has to consider them. It is reported that the US Embassy in China is studying the scandals in the Chinese business community and investigating the complaints of American businessmen. The US Embassy is also closely watching the trend of the Chinese government's plan to nationalize industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Withdrawing US Troops from China; The House of Representatives Plans to Ask Marshal for a Report</h3>

<h3>The Adjustment of Foreign Exchange Is Not Allowed; All Rumors Are Groundless; Remarks by a Responsible Official of the Ministry of Finance</h3>

<h3>Before the Dissolution of the Executive Headquarters; All Three Parties Were Courteous and Thorough; Frequent Contacts and Interactions in Recent Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 4th] The withdrawal work of the Executive Headquarters will be carried out slowly on a broad plan. The Communist Party did not leave in a huff with resentment as generally expected. The US observation group in Yan'an will also extend its "observation" time as much as possible with the consent of both parties. The personnel of the three parties, who have been arguing fiercely for years, are all polite and thorough on the eve of their separation, as if they are leaving room for the future. The reporter silently observes the movements of the Executive Headquarters and finds the following signs: (1) The abolition of the Communist Party's Executive Headquarters is unprecedentedly silent. Not only did Ye Jianying refuse to meet any Chinese and foreign reporters, but its press office also refused to criticize it. Only a certain important person recently made a statement saying that after the US withdraws, since the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not explicitly announced its cancellation, it seems that another way should be found to decide the existence or abolition of the Executive Headquarters. The implication is quite worthy of consideration. Today, the reporter asked Huang Hua, the spokesman of the Communist Party, whether the Communist Party was satisfied with the withdrawal of the US military this time? Huang replied: This question must be answered by Yan'an. Since the US announced its withdrawal from the Executive Headquarters, the Communist Party has claimed that Yan'an will make a statement, but Yan'an has not published a single word so far. The instructions from Yan'an to Ye Jianying are also only a few words, without any approval. The caution of Yan'an on this matter can be imagined. (2) The withdrawal of Communist Party personnel will not be as rapid as generally expected and as previously announced by the Communist Party. Huang Hua, the director of the Communist Party's press office, will go to Yan'an for contact tomorrow, but will return after staying in Yan'an for one night. Huang said: Because US aircraft still need to transport their own personnel and government personnel, it is impossible to know when the Communist Party will be able to start withdrawing and when the withdrawal will be completed. It is also learned that the US military observation group in Yan'an will also make plans to withdraw after the Communist Party personnel have completed their withdrawal. The reporter asked Huang Hua: Will the Communist Party retain or express its regret for the observation group? Huang replied: Regret is also human nature. (3) There have been frequent contacts between the personnel of the three parties, especially between the Communist Party and the United States. Yesterday, Ye Jianying visited General Gillon, who was suffering from a slight cold, with Chief of Staff Xue Zizheng and Press Office Director Huang Hua. Tomorrow, Ye Jianying is likely to attend Cai Wenzhi's banquet. Ye also plans to host a banquet for the Kuomintang, the United States, and reporters. The harmony of the atmosphere is also unprecedented.</p>
<h3>A Comprehensive Observation of the War Situation This Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Since the Central Committee rejected the government's peace talks proposal, its active treasonous actions have been known to all. However, the strength it holds to betray the country is weakening day by day. Recently, the communist troops, after falsely claiming to restore the situation of January 13, 1946 by violence, launched a large-scale offensive, but they were defeated by the National Army everywhere. As a result, not only did they gain nothing, but they also suffered the greatest losses. The situation of the communist troops' intrusion this week is described as follows:</p>
<p>Southern Shandong</p>
<p>The communist troops under Chen Yi who attacked southern Shandong, claiming to be more than 100,000, came fiercely, captured Yixian, plundered Qizhuang, and cooperated with their exaggerated propaganda offensive. Many people who did not understand the truth were misled by them. In fact, the communist troops paid a great price for the capture of every city and town, so after Zaozhuang fell, the communist troops were exhausted. At this time, the National Army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway was all deployed, and Hao Pengju's troops also rose up and returned to righteousness at this time. The communist troops in southern Shandong knew that their end was coming and tried to trap themselves. Since January 31, more than 10,000 troops were transferred from Mengyin to reinforce Linyi at full speed. At the same time, they concentrated their main force in the middle area of Zaozhuang, Tancheng, and Linyi to prevent the National Army from counterattacking. Since the 1st of this month, the National Army has been advancing steadily, and a large-scale annihilation war situation has been formed. It is generally expected that a brilliant war country can be obtained within half a month.</p>
<p>Eastern Henan</p>
<p>The communist troops under Liu Bocheng, to coordinate with the National Army in Xuzhou and support southern Shandong, broke through into eastern Henan this week, attacking Tuocheng, attacking Luyi, and capturing Taikang. Although they roamed around, Chen Yi's defeat in southern Shandong was already determined, and it was of no benefit to his overall situation. Moreover, the communist troops in Dangshan, Xiaoba, Yejigang and other places have all been driven back, and the railway between Bian and Xu has resumed traffic. With the help of the elite troops of the National Army in the Dai, Pei, Xiao, and Dang area, not only is the periphery of Xuzhou as solid as a rock, but also the communist troops under Liu Bocheng are in danger of being annihilated by the National Army due to the dispersion of troops.</p>
<p>North China</p>
<p>The National Army, which counterattacked Xiaoyi in western Shanxi, recovered Majiaying, Xiaoyi Village, Sujiaying and other strongholds on January 22, and the communist troops that had invaded Xiaoyi have been shaken. Nanguan Town on the Tongpu Line and Fenxi to the west have been recaptured by the National Army. There are no major communist troops active in southern and western Shanxi. Weijiazhuang and Anding, two military stations on the Pingjin Line in Hebei, were once captured by the communist troops and then recovered by the National Army. Traffic has now resumed, and the National Army has dispatched powerful troops to clear them along the line. In the future, the traffic between Pingjin should be safe. The communist troops on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway used more than 20,000 troops to attack Dingxian fiercely. The communist troops continued to advance, and dead and wounded were everywhere. Although Dingxian was difficult to be captured by the communist troops on January 28, the price they paid was far beyond what ordinary people could imagine. At present, the National Army is advancing in an encirclement posture.</p>
<p>Northeast China</p>
<p>The communist troops who crossed the Songhua River and invaded the south have all been driven back this week. The National Army crossed the Songhua River to pursue them on January 24 and reached the area east of Wukeshu and near Taolaizhao. Later, after the task was completed, they returned safely to the south bank.</p>
<p>Looking at the wars in various parts of the country this week, none of them were launched by the communist troops, and the rules of their conduct are quite similar, that is, at the beginning of the battle, the communist troops attack fiercely with a chaotic posture, while the National Army is steady and steady, so on the surface, the communist troops seem to gain something in the initial battle, but in the end they fail because the price they pay is too high.</p>

<h3>An Industrialist in Shanghai; Talks about Industry and Peace</h3>
<p>Continuous Civil Strife Puts Industry in Dire Straits</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The reporter recently visited a famous industrialist to ask about the impact of civil strife on industry and his views on the industrial and commercial peace movement. He believes that if the civil strife does not stop, industry will fall into dire straits. Because in the current environment, coal mines are destroyed, transportation lines are cut off, and the supply of raw materials and the sales of products are all problematic. Moreover, due to political reasons, labor disputes are very likely to occur, and unreasonable increases in labor prices make people afraid to invest in industry. Regarding the peace movement, he told the reporter: It is currently in the stage of soliciting members, and concrete practical actions have been considered, but not yet decided. A certain newspaper in this city suggested using strikes and tax resistance as a means, which is a pressure specifically on the government and is only beneficial to the Communist Party, which is unfair as a method of mediation. What may be implemented in the future is to send representatives to Yan'an and Nanjing to appeal separately. Also, all the initiators are willing to solemnly declare that they have no intention of joining the government by mediating.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union is Building Economic Spheres of Influence in Various Parts of Xinjiang; Commentary Published by American Howard News Agency</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 3rd] The Howard News Agency published today that the Soviet Union is now quietly building its economic spheres of influence in various parts of Xinjiang Province, China. When the Chinese Communists and their comrades in the central territory launched propaganda to fiercely attack the US troops stationed in China, it diverted public opinion from paying attention to the new developments of the Soviet Union in Xinjiang. According to the Xinjiang News: (1) One-third of the land in northwestern Xinjiang along the Soviet border is already under the control of the East Turkestan People's Republic. (2) According to the agreement, the northwestern region is still a part of the entire Xinjiang Province, but the People's Republic has thoroughly implemented autonomy, formally prohibiting the National Government army from entering the area. (3) The National Government army is blocked 70 miles west of the provincial capital of Xinjiang. Work on the Soviet oil fields behind the "curtain" has also been suspended. (4) The Soviet Union's influence in this area is not military in nature, but economic and political in nature. Due to the poor management and neglect of the National Government, the Soviet Union has been able to extend its influence. (5) The Central Government has ignored the Xinjiang Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhizhong's repeated requests for political and economic assistance.</p>
<h3>The Sino-Philippine Treaty; Will Be Negotiated Soon</h3>

After the friendly treaty is ratified, the maritime and commercial treaties will begin to be negotiated.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Sumatra Suffer Losses; Our Government Protests to the Netherlands; Representatives of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Arrive in Nanjing to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 4th Broadcast: According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, regarding the significant losses of life and property suffered by overseas Chinese during the fighting between Indonesia and the Netherlands in southern Sumatra during the first five days of January, the Chinese government has lodged a serious protest with the Dutch government. It is reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has suggested to the Dutch and Indonesian authorities to establish safe zones and allow overseas Chinese to arm themselves for self-defense.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 4th] According to people close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese government has protested to the Dutch government regarding the losses suffered by overseas Chinese in Palembang, East India, and has suggested re-demarcating overseas Chinese safe zones and organizing overseas Chinese civil defense forces before the restoration of normal conditions, so that they can protect the safety zone with the assistance of the Dutch and East Indian armies. The Dutch and East Indian authorities should respect this safe zone and allow them to evacuate before taking military action. The Dutch authorities in Batavia have accepted China's suggestion and are currently negotiating to discuss its implementation. At the same time, Jiang Jiadong, the Chinese Consul General in the area, has protested to the authorities of the Republic of East India, requesting that they find ways to rescue overseas Chinese. It is reported that the authorities of East India have expressed their apologies and said that they are investigating the recent incidents encountered by overseas Chinese. According to people close to the Dutch Embassy here, the Dutch authorities in Batavia have given relief supplies worth 100,000 Dutch currency to the Overseas Chinese Red Cross Society to express sympathy for the losses suffered by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Luo Weiji and other five representatives of overseas Chinese petitioners in Vietnam arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 4th. After getting off the train, they went to the Central Party Headquarters and other agencies to petition. They will visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and other agencies in the coming days, and plan to meet with Chairman Chiang. According to them, what the overseas Chinese compatriots hope most at present is that the government can send high-ranking officials to Vietnam to express condolences and transport materials by air to provide relief. Evacuation is currently difficult to achieve, and neutral zones are not very useful. The government has allocated 2 million Vietnamese currency for relief funds, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has also allocated 50 million national currency.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] According to external sources, since the Chinese-Vietnamese district of Hanoi, Vietnam, has been surrounded by French troops, our Consul General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, has repeatedly contacted the French and Vietnamese authorities separately to find ways to evacuate overseas Chinese compatriots, so that they can move to the western district of Hanoi and the Vietnamese mainland to take refuge. At the same time, he has also requested the evacuation of Vietnamese people on behalf of Vietnam. The French side has also agreed. After the French and Vietnamese sides agreed, it was decided that the evacuation period would be from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM on January 15. Consul General Yuan personally presided over everything, and the British and American consuls also came to strengthen the safety guarantee for the evacuation of the people. As a result, a total of 7,800 Vietnamese people were evacuated out of the country, and about 200 overseas Chinese families who lived in the mainland or voluntarily evacuated to the mainland, and 600 people were evacuated to the western district. Because the overseas Chinese were observing for the first time, the number of evacuees was not large, but the evacuation order was good.</p>

<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 4th] The steamer "Xi'an" was burned down on the morning of the 4th. The ship caught fire in the middle of the hull. The ship was stored with some kerosene and gasoline, so the fire quickly spread to the entire ship, leaving only wreckage. According to eyewitnesses, most of the victims died of suffocation.

<h3>Wang Shusen Embezzlement Case; The Inside Story is Complex</h3>
<p>Wang's Elderly Father Receives Reporters</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] The embezzlement case of Wang Shusen, director of the Liaoning Office of the Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan, is confusing. The authorities of the office refused to give a definite answer to visiting reporters. In addition, Deputy Director Yu Mingzhou told a reporter from a Shenyang newspaper that although Wang's case involves other people, I am inconvenient to disclose it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Panyang, 4th] According to an informal statement from the Northeast Branch regarding Wang Shusen's family, the reason for demanding 2.1 million circulation coupons from Wang was to protect Wang, because Wang's wholesale of 100 bags of flour and 400 sets of clothes for refugees was unaccounted for, and it was intended to use this money to compensate. It is also reported that the branch has sent Wang's detained seal, gold ring, watch, etc. to the court. In addition, Wang Zhengshan, an investigator of the Liaoning Office, has fled due to the case. It seems that this case has been divided into two parts, one is Wang's embezzlement situation, and the other is the general public's attention to the process and unique twists and turns of the branch's arrest of Wang.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] Wang Shusen's elderly father, Wang Fengyang, told reporters on the 4th: If Wang is guilty of embezzlement, he is willing to be subject to legal sanctions. However, the branch detained Wang in Director Liu's mansion for as long as four days and extorted 2.1 million circulation coupons to seek private reconciliation. At the same time, Wang and Director Liu also have debt entanglements. This move is illegal and requests the public to uphold justice.</p>

<h3>World Food Shortage is Serious; China Faces Famine</h3>
<p>The New York Times Calls on Wealthy Countries to Provide Assistance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd Dispatch] The New York Times said in an article reviewing the world food situation: Once the United Nations ends its work in Europe and Asia, China will be the worst of the countries facing famine. According to reports from the newspaper's reporters in twenty countries, regardless of what improvements we had hoped to achieve a year ago, the famines in all victorious and defeated countries require assistance from wealthier countries to avoid disaster. It is predicted that Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Yugoslavia will all encounter great difficulties after the end of the United Nations, especially China. According to the reporters' reports, the world food shortage was initially caused by the destruction and death of agricultural tools and livestock, and then by the record-breaking drought in Europe last year. In addition to pointing out the necessity of foreign aid, the newspaper also pointed out the extremely important facts, namely the importance of proper food distribution and price controls. The article said: "The people of Britain, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia all feel the same difficulties, because the black market is rampant in these countries, especially in China, which has hardly been tasted by the government." And said: "Due to the convenience and recklessness of the black market for the rich, the food black market has become an important political factor, and will obviously continue to maintain this situation until the final formal supply is restored." Dou Zun'an, a reporter for the New York Times in Nanjing, reported that after the United Nations stops shipping materials to China around March 31, the situation in China this year will be even worse than usual, which, according to objective statistics, should already be called a famine. After Shi Zun'an pointed out that the famine in our country will inevitably cause a serious disaster this year, he listed the following facts that make the future of the food shortage worrying: (1) There is not much surplus of food left after the normal autumn harvest last year, and the areas with insufficient food may not be able to maintain it until the new harvest. (2) According to the estimate of our Executive Yuan, the harvest in 1947 will be 3 million tons, which will be below the average level. (3) Most of the food in the United Nations plan has been shipped to China and has been distributed. (4) A famine has occurred in Anhui, and the food supply situation in famine-stricken areas such as Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong is becoming increasingly critical.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui Speaks to Reporters: Guangdong Has Not Arrested Political Offenders; Taking Back Hong Kong and Macau is Necessary to Eliminate Smuggling</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Director Zhang Fakui recently held his first press conference of the year at his official residence in the Governor's Office. He reported on his observations on the constitution-making process, as well as the anti-smuggling and security situation in Guangdong. He stated: The constitution, which determines all major plans for our country, has been successfully passed. This is the most progressive democratic constitution in the world and the soul of democratic politics. This year is the year for preparing for the implementation of constitutional governance. Both the government and the public must work together, especially officials, who should take the lead in abiding by the law as an example to the people, in order to achieve the goal of rule of law. As for rumors circulating that political prisoners have been arrested here, these are completely malicious slanders and have no basis whatsoever. Since the restoration of Guangdong, no political prisoners have ever been arrested. Secondly, regarding smuggling cases, a particularly large number occurred at the end of last year, such as the smuggling cases involving the Haiou warship and landing craft. These have been forwarded to the capital for handling separately. The anti-smuggling work in other local areas has been strengthened, and the trend of smuggling has slightly subsided. However, to completely eliminate it, there is no other way but to take back Hong Kong and Macau. As for the issue of security, I have always paid close attention to it. According to statistics on bandit suppression achievements in the 35th year of the Republic (1946), over 6,000 people were killed, over 3,000 were wounded, and over 2,600 surrendered and reformed. Currently, there are still about 13,600 remaining bandits, of which 6,000 are on Hainan Island, and the rest are distributed along the Fujian-Guangdong border and the Jiangnan Road area in the northeast. However, to completely quell the bandit problem, sound local administrative organs are essential for effective results.</p>

<h3>The Wudu Man: Whether They Exist is Difficult to Determine; Wang Yongyan Plans a Fourth Excavation</h3>

Acting Director Wang Bingyan of the Gansu Science and Education Museum will go to Wudu to conduct a fourth excavation in the hope of making new discoveries.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Thinking of Farmers from the Gold Rush</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the gold and foreign exchange markets in Shanghai have experienced drastic fluctuations. Regarding gold, speculators stirred up trouble a month ago, causing the price of gold to rise. The Central Bank then continuously released large amounts of gold, and the market situation stabilized. However, on the 1st of this month, the gold and foreign exchange markets suddenly surged again, jumping out of the 3,965,000 range, crossing the 4,000,000 mark, and rising to 4,060,000. By Monday of this week, it continued to rise to 4,420,000. As of the time of writing, it has risen to 4,800,000, with a strong tendency to cross the 5,000,000 mark. During the same period, the black market exchange rate for U.S. dollars rose from 7,000 to 9,000 yesterday. In the tide of skyrocketing gold prices, it has also caused fluctuations in other commodity prices. Taking cotton yarn as an example, the cotton yarn market on November 1st was overwhelmed by buying pressure, and yarn prices rose across the board. On the second day, the upward trend intensified, and yarn prices jumped by 500,000 to 600,000 in a single day. The 42-count double-strand yarn returned to the 5,000,000 mark, and the future of the yarn market still seems to be thriving. As for rice prices, the changes in the past few days have also been significant. These drastic fluctuations in the market have not yet shown signs of stopping. The impact of this relates to the safety of the entire national economy. We cannot ignore these economic fluctuations.</p>
<p>The reason for the rise of these economic fluctuations, according to our observation, seems to be traceable to the rumors that were spread not long ago, saying that the government would have new adjustments for foreign exchange. Although the authorities have repeatedly denied these rumors, speculators have not only not stopped because of this, but have instead fueled the flames and stirred up trouble. According to a report in this newspaper on January 1st, "The black market exchange rate for U.S. dollars has skyrocketed, and the price of gold has been driven up." Later, after the price of gold was raised, it then affected the foreign exchange market and other market prices. During this period, although the Central Bank released a huge amount of gold, it failed to stop the rise in gold prices. Moreover, some speculators, seeing that the Central Bank had repeatedly released large amounts of gold, even believed that its strength was insufficient to control the gold market, and therefore showed off their skills. Under these chaotic circumstances, it was heard that the Central Bank had to temporarily suspend the release of gold; the result of this was that it caused another rise in gold prices, the black market exchange rate for foreign exchange, and other general market prices. After these factors played a mutually alternating role, the market has not been able to return to tranquility.</p>
<p>Regarding the current market fluctuations, we believe that psychological factors are playing a major role. The initial market fluctuations were due to rumors. The spread of rumors, coupled with the speculators stirring up trouble, brought things to a very dangerous state. Taking advantage of these unhealthy psychological conditions to stir up trouble is certainly a consistent trick of speculators; but the existence of this unhealthy psychology is ultimately a morbid state. This unhealthy psychology is a manifestation of a lack of self-confidence. In today's turbulent world, we must first establish self-confidence. Therefore, the first thing we should propose for this market fluctuation is to restore our self-confidence and not be misled by circulating rumors. The spread of rumors itself originally has a malicious effect; if we are misled by rumors, in the end, not only will individuals suffer losses, but the nation and country will also be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Establishing a healthy psychology is certainly what the general public should do, but we cannot help but ask: What policy is the government adopting for gold? Selling gold seems to be the consistent policy of the Central Bank, that is, the government, but the result of its implementation has still failed to effectively suppress the price of gold. What exactly went wrong in this? In early May of last year, when the price of gold fluctuated, the Central Bank released more than 3,000 bars of gold in three days. At that time, the price of gold hovered around 1,600,000 to 1,700,000. By July, it had risen to 1,970,000, and by December, it had risen to 3,900,000. According to statistics published by the Shanghai Municipal Government, if the price of gold in January of the 35th year of the Republic (1946) was 100, it had risen to 214 by July, which is an increase of 114 times in six months. Therefore, despite the Central Bank's gold sales, it initially failed to curb the rise in gold prices. As a result, it merely created opportunities for general speculators or those engaged in gold trading to hoard gold, causing these people to get rich. It is heard that some of the customers who were allocated gold by the Central Bank yesterday hoarded the allocated gold without releasing it, which further contributed to the rise in gold prices. Therefore, at this time of gold price fluctuations, we must ask what policy the government is adopting for gold.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the skyrocketing price of gold has affected general commodity prices and promoted the rise in general living expenses. Today, China's industrial and commercial sectors have reached an extremely difficult state, and the increase in general living expenses will undoubtedly affect them. Because the increase in general living expenses inevitably affects the increase in the cost of living index for employees; and today, the standard wage rate is based on the cost of living index, its impact will inevitably promote the increase in general wages, adding to the burden of those engaged in industry and commerce. Currently, traffic is obstructed, and the circulation of goods has been hit hard; moreover, we are facing the invasion of cheap imported goods. China's industrial and commercial sectors are already on the verge of danger. If we add the impact caused by the current skyrocketing price of gold, in the end, it seems certain to force the collapse of general industry and commerce. In order to save our national economy, we must not allow this frenzy to continue unchecked.</p>
<p>However, those who are most deeply affected are still the farmers who account for more than 80 percent of the Chinese people. Yesterday was Farmers' Day, and it is extremely natural for Farmers' Day to be a theme for farmers to complain about their hardships. However, regardless of rent reduction or land to the tiller, the biggest difficulty currently encountered by farmers lies in "cheap grain hurting farmers." The so-called "cheap grain" does not necessarily refer to grain, but refers to the low prices of general agricultural products, making it difficult for farmers to make a living, forcing them to abandon production. According to a report in this newspaper yesterday, the China Silk Company is willing to give 15 million mulberry seedlings to Zhejiang Province, but the farmers of Zhejiang Province believe that the price of silk is too low to make a profit and do not dare to plant them, which shows that the low prices of agricultural products are forcing farmers to abandon agricultural production. If we let this trend develop naturally, it will make the future of the entire national economy unimaginable. Now we see a general increase in commodity prices caused by the fluctuations in gold prices, but the prices of agricultural products have failed to follow this trend upward. As a result, the increase in the prices of general manufactured goods will turn to make the prices of general agricultural products relatively fall. The prices of agricultural products are already cheap, and now they are being forced to fall again, which will naturally make the lives of farmers even more difficult. On the occasion of Farmers' Day, we do not need to talk grandly about rural relief. What is most urgent is to seek the stability of general commodity prices and the increase in the prices of agricultural products; it must be made profitable for farmers to engage in agriculture before China's agricultural production can have hope of vigorous recovery. Agriculture is the main production of our country. If agriculture cannot recover, then what can be imagined for the future of the national economy?</p>
<p>In short, the volatility of the gold price is of great importance. In addition to urging the people to establish a sound mentality, we also hope that the government can clarify its policies so that the gold price and general commodity prices can be stabilized. As for the reported volatility of gold prices and general commodity prices, it is due to the deterioration of the domestic situation, which is especially not what Shen Bao wants. We hope that everyone can build up self-confidence.</p>

<h3>Treating the Root Cause and Relieving the Emergency Simultaneously: Zhejiang Seawalls are Safe from Tides; No Disaster Expected from Spring or Autumn Tides This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Chairman Shen returned to Hangzhou last night and went to Sibao and Wubao today to inspect the seawall project and visited the Pan En, the first ocean-going vessel on the Qiantang River. Since the spring tide is approaching and the seawall project depends entirely on Tangshan's stone transportation, Shen praised the ship highly.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou News] As the spring tide approaches, the residents along the Qiantang River are worried about the seawalls. This is because the Seawall Engineering Bureau has recently been preparing for permanent engineering projects, while the stone seawalls that have already collapsed have not yet been repaired. If the temporary earthen dikes are breached, there will be no materials to repair them in time. Therefore, they do not approve of the Seawall Engineering Bureau not doing the work of "1947" but being obsessed with the "work of 1951." This is truly not the right thing to do. This reporter made a special visit to Dr. Tang Zhenxu, Deputy Chief Engineer and Director of the Design Department of the Seawall Engineering Bureau. According to him, the preparation work for the permanent root-cause treatment plan is only one-sixteenth of this year's work; the important focus is still on temporary rescue engineering; next year, permanent repair engineering can be carried out, that is, replacing the earthen dikes with stone seawalls. The true root-cause treatment plan must wait two years before it can begin, and it will also take six years. Both the spring and autumn tides this year can be safely passed without causing disasters. As for the Qiantang River experimental research, there was a proposal to establish it at Zhejiang University, but the Water Conservancy Commission intends to establish it in Nanjing. For the convenience of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, it may be established in our bureau in Hangzhou.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently ordered various counties to say that in the future, special criminal cases related to smoking drugs, bandits, military service, and transportation equipment, all those who also deal with military law shall be accepted by the county government, etc., which has aroused suspicion among people from all walks of life. It is said that the Ministry's order once stipulated that except for active soldiers, the above-mentioned cases shall be handled by the judiciary. Then the question of the authority of the local court and the county government is quite thought-provoking. This reporter specially asked Dean Wang Jue of the Wu District Court on the 4th about this issue and received a statement that the question of whether special criminal cases belong exclusively to the military or include the general public and to which party they ultimately belong is also quite difficult to understand in this court. Therefore, it has been submitted to the Jiangsu Higher Court for explanation to the Ministry of Justice, but before receiving instructions, this court will still handle all special criminal cases belonging to the people in accordance with the previous order.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Trial Planted in Zhejiang Province, Yields Twice as High as Local Varieties</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Correspondent, 4th] The Jianying Agricultural Extension Institute trialed the planting of American cotton last year along the coast and on both sides of Hangzhou Bay. Reports indicate that it was extremely successful. For example, at the Yu Tao Cotton Farm, the yield of American cotton was twice that of local cotton, and the selling price was also a quarter higher.

<p>Editor: We are farmers from the countryside. The most urgent need for farmers is oxen. During the war, most of the oxen were taken away by the enemy and puppets or slaughtered. With the arrival of victory and rural recovery, the supply of oxen is lacking. It is urgent to cultivate calves. However, butchers are abandoning the fundamental for the trivial, purchasing small yellow calves aged three to five months at high prices to supply slaughterhouses for sale. With spring plowing imminent, the supply of oxen cannot meet the demand, which is a matter of great concern for rural production! We hope that the authorities will quickly issue a ban, and pay more attention to the cultivation of calves in particular to maintain agriculture. (A Country Bumpkin)</p>
<p>Residents of Chang'an Road Seek Safety</p>
<p>Editor: We live on Chang'an Road in the Zhabei Xinzha Bridge area. During the enemy-puppet period, there was a cotton military uniform factory, originally named "Management General Supervision Department Special Military Uniform Office." We don't know why it was not taken over or closed after the victory, but was changed to its current name, "United Flower Clothing Factory," which is a small factory. The equipment in the factory is extremely imperfect, especially the fire-fighting equipment is lacking, and the person in charge is a so-called "outsider," resulting in continuous fires in the factory. Neighboring residents have suffered a lot. Several times of negotiation have been ignored. A fire broke out again the other day (26th), and the fire was so intense that it could not be controlled, which has been reported in the newspapers. Fortunately, the firemen worked hard to extinguish the fire, so the property of the residents was spared. Chang'an Road is narrow, like a lane. Most of the houses on the road are old houses from before the war. If one house is in trouble, it will inevitably spread. Therefore, we especially ask for a corner of your newspaper to disclose this matter, hoping that the relevant authorities will investigate and correct it, so as to maintain the safety of our property.

<h3>Exorbitant Rent Increases in Remote Streets</h3>
<p>Editor: I live in Shudeli, Nanjing Street, behind the Shanghai Military Camp Police Station in the Nanshi district. The location is remote, and most of the residents are poor and struggling. Now the landlord is implementing a price increase, with rents increasing by 1,400 times. The municipal government has previously announced restrictions on arbitrary rent increases, and the Municipal Council also has discussions on restricting rent increases. Now, the landlord in that area violates the law and disregards the difficulties of the people. Please disclose this matter in your newspaper and urge the municipal authorities to effectively stop it.

<h3>Control of Atomic Energy Program, US Strives to Implement Original Intention, Universal Disarmament Hopes to Achieve Solution</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] According to information obtained this morning: US Representative Austin will attend today's opening meeting. Austin had previously assured that the United States would disarm as quickly as any other country, but only if the great powers abandoned control of atomic energy, concluded a general peace treaty, and established an international police force. Austin will insist at today's meeting that atomic weapons should be controlled and will point out that the United States has been working on this issue for six months. Mr. Austin will also explain that if the great powers cannot reach an agreement on how to ban atomic weapons and how to monitor and prevent the illegal manufacture of atomic bombs, then universal disarmament is fundamentally hopeless. Mr. Austin will also solemnly point out that the greatest purpose of the United Nations organization is collective security, and the core work of collective security is international control of atomic energy. In order to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union on the disarmament plan, Austin will propose a three-point compromise plan that has been secretly discussed with other representatives: (1) Establish a committee to discuss detailed methods for abandoning weapons, especially weapons of "collective destruction"; (2) Security Council representatives should determine the definition of weapons of "collective destruction" and explain how universal disarmament and the establishment of an international police force are related; (3) The Security Council should begin to discuss the US plan to ban atomic weapons at this meeting. Most representatives are carefully considering this plan, and the British representative will propose amendments, but the final instructions from London are still awaited. The Soviet Union is expected to oppose the US plan.</p>
<h3>Secrets of Manufacturing Atomic Bombs, Soviet Union Has Obtained Important Information, Baruch Reports to Congress</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Former US Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission Baruch reportedly stated at a secret meeting of the Senate Atomic Committee that there is evidence that the Soviet Union has learned to some extent about the secrets of the United States manufacturing atomic bombs, but the Soviet Union is not yet sure of the meaning of the secrets it has learned and how to use them. Previously, Baruch had accused scientists in the Senate Atomic Committee of not making a big mistake by publishing the Smith Report of 1945. At this point in Baruch's speech, the committee asked the audience to leave and closed the meeting room door to continue listening to Mr. Baruch's report. The content of the report may not be disclosed to the outside world by any member. However, an Associated Press reporter learned the outline from a member and confirmed it from another member. Baruch also stated in the Senate Atomic Committee that based on certain questions raised by the Soviet representative at the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission, it is evident that the US defense against the manufacture of atomic bombs has been leaked. For example, the cipher used by the US has obviously been learned by the Soviet Union, but judging from the words of its representatives, the meaning of the cipher is not yet clear. Mr. Baruch said that Canada also discovered primordial elements, and Soviet spies had been arrested in Canada, which shows that the Soviet Union had learned some secrets from Canada.</p>
<h3>Bevin Signs Five-Nation Peace Treaty</h3>

<h3>Economic System for the Ruhr Area, France Prepares Memorandum, Sent to Britain, America, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[France News Agency, Paris, 3rd] The French government sent a memorandum to the British, American, and Soviet ambassadors to France on the 1st of this month, clarifying its views on the future economic system of the Ruhr area. The memorandum is purely technical in nature and states that the Ruhr area should never again be an industrial base for German aggression. The resources of the Ruhr area should be used to promote the common interests of peaceful countries. Before the war, the coal production in the Ruhr area accounted for 90% of the country, the production of pig iron accounted for 72%, and the production of steel accounted for 74%. Therefore, its importance is very great. The implementation of a special economic system in the Ruhr area is necessary to achieve the following objectives: (1) Develop coal production to the maximum extent and ensure that coal distribution is determined according to needs. (2) The amount of Ruhr products enjoyed by Germany should be determined in the peace treaty. In short, the Ruhr area should be regarded as the common property of peaceful countries.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Opposes a Few Countries Dominating Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 4th] Canadian Prime Minister King stated in Parliament today that Canada is determined not to allow a very small number of countries to "rule" peace. We have fought to prevent two countries from ruling the world, so we are determined not to allow two or three countries or four or one country to rule peace. I hope the Big Four can seriously consider this.</p>

<h3>Atomic Energy Research in Various Countries, Our Country Also Has Uranium Ore Discovery</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] On the eve of the Security Council's renewed debate on universal disarmament and atomic control, the New York Herald Tribune commented that a total of 24 countries are directly related to atomic energy activities. The newspaper listed 11 countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, Britain, France, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, all of which have government-run research or development programs. There are 13 other countries with different domestic control situations, or have manufactured or stored uranium ore. These 13 countries are Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, India, Africa, Poland, Portugal, and South Africa. The Soviet Union has been researching atomic fission machines for several years. Canada produces large quantities of polonium. France is building an "atomic village" to concentrate research. The British government officially announced plans for five atomic research institutes, and its plan is only limited by scientists and raw materials. The largest research and development factory is in the United States. President Truman listed $443 million in the 1947-1948 budget related to atomic manufacturing. The Herald Tribune said that China has two uranium ore discoveries, one near Haicheng in southern Northeast China. During the war, Japan spent two years digging out two tons of uranium ore during its occupation. Personnel from the Northeast Economic Commission recently said in Shenyang that uranium ore is under government control, but they suspect that the reserves may not be very rich. According to scientist Li ShuHua, who announced in Shanghai last fall, the Academia Sinica plans to purchase an atomic fission machine from the United States for $250,000 to start researching atomic energy.</p>
<h3>Tumult in Palestine</h3>
<p>—Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Office</p>
<p>…The sacred land of the past has become today's world of darkness…</p>
<p>Recently, Jewish extremists in Palestine have reignited the flames of terror, plunging various regions into extreme chaos. A certain journalist recounts the witnessed reality as follows:</p>
<p>Amidst the Christmas and New Year greetings, the holy land of Palestine is a dark world. Due to the various atrocities committed by Jewish terrorist groups in recent days, including the kidnapping and assassination of British personnel, many British soldiers now carry weapons even when off duty. The reporter witnessed over a hundred paratroopers, heavily intoxicated, brandishing machine guns and taking over Zion Square in the center of Jerusalem. Pedestrians fled in panic to avoid becoming innocent victims.</p>
<p>Previously, British soldiers would only whisper and gossip about Jews in private, but now they openly insult them in public. Anti-Jewish rhetoric from British officials is ubiquitous in nightclubs and bars. Occasionally, there are also incidents of Jewish shop windows being smashed and Jews being insulted in public places.</p>
<p>Stores Close Early: Shops and cafes throughout the country now close as early as 6:00 PM every evening. Steel plates are installed on shop windows and doorways to prevent them from being smashed. This anti-Jewish sentiment among the British is a result of the violence perpetrated by Jewish terrorist groups against British forces. British soldiers see themselves as individuals, not as enforcers of British policy in Palestine. Therefore, when a Jewish terrorist kills a British soldier, other British soldiers feel a sense of shared animosity and vengeance, especially veterans who feel it is not worth dying in the holy land after surviving the war. However, most British soldiers are able to restrain their emotions, and while they talk a lot, they rarely take action. Many Jews acknowledge this point.</p>
<p>Initially, British soldiers flogged a young Jewish man who robbed a bank, so on December 29th of last year, Jewish terrorists retaliated by flogging one British officer and three soldiers. This sparked a new wave of uncontrollable terrorist activities. Later, the terrorist groups used a new weapon – liquid flamethrowers – against the British. While the World Zionist Congress was being held in Basel, Switzerland, the Irgun temporarily announced a ceasefire, but now they have resumed their fight against the British.</p>
<p>Bombings Occur Frequently: Bomb explosions in Jerusalem have spread throughout the holy land. British authorities have ordered all troops to carry weapons and to patrol in pairs. On the 3rd, the British government issued an ultimatum to Jewish terrorist groups: if acts of terror continue, the British government will take strict measures, such as the military control and strict curfews that were implemented after the bombing of the King David Hotel last summer. The British High Commissioner for Palestine, Lieutenant General Sir Alan Cunningham, hastily traveled to London to discuss strategy with Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones and Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Montgomery. Both the British government and the Jews believe that Cunningham's trip is to seek government permission to launch a full-scale military offensive against Jewish extremists.</p>
<p>Jews are Divided into Two Factions: A spokesman for the Jewish Agency in London recently issued a statement expressing regret for the actions of Jewish extremists, saying, "The British Empire is not threatened by the actions of the Irgun; the future Jewish nation is much more likely to be threatened." Dr. Stephen Wise, the founder of the Zionist Organization of America, returned from the Zionist Congress dissatisfied with his role in the organization, criticizing the Congress for not considering remedies for the state of terror in Palestine.</p>
<p>British and Jews May Reach Understanding: Judging from the reaction of these moderate Jews, the aim of Jewish terrorist atrocities is not only to challenge the British Army, but also to undermine the compromise policies of the moderates. However, Zionist leaders in London continue to stubbornly seek an agreement. The leader of the Jewish Agency, Goldmann, and the chairman of the previous World Zionist Congress hope to encourage the British to change the status quo in Palestine. The reason Jews refused to attend the London Palestine Conference last month was because of the existence of this "status quo." Goldmann stated that although an agreement cannot be reached for the time being, the goodwill of the Colonial Office may facilitate cooperation and understanding between the British and the Jews.</p>
<p>British troops in Palestine are fully armed, patrolling along the railway line to prevent Jews from laying mines.</p>

<h3>Attending Meeting Receiving Secret Report: Seymour Road Fire Case Takes Unexpected Turn; Involving a Group of Police Officers</h3>
<p>Victim, surnamed Ge, Has Important Evidence to Offer; Director Xuan Indicates That More Than 20 People Need to Be Summoned</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Seymour Road Fire Investigation Committee, Zhang Naizuo, representative of the Municipal Council, and others are scheduled to visit the Fire Department today. This morning at 10:00 AM, they will gather at the City Hall Auditorium, where Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang will briefly report on the current fire prevention facilities. Afterwards, they will visit various fire departments to compare the tool facilities, economic allocation, and personnel system with the fire alarm system during the Public Works Department era in order to serve as a reference for improvement measures.</p>
<p>The work to excavate the Wang Family Fire Site was originally scheduled to begin yesterday, but due to personnel not being ready, it has been changed to start at 2:00 PM today. Zhang Da, Director of the Police Bureau's Supervisory Office, Wang Qilin, Deputy Director of the Jiangning District Sub-bureau, Liu Jingnuo, representative of the District Residents, Shao Yongsheng, representative of the District Party Department of the Municipal Council, and others held a meeting at the residence of Ba長長 Cai Guoliang on Xiaoshadu Road yesterday afternoon and decided to first withdraw 600,000 from the city government to hire 10 laborers for excavation. Under the leadership of Director Zhang, representatives from the police sub-bureau, the Ba甲 Department, and the Wang family will be on site to supervise. The excavation work is scheduled to be completed within three days. Director Zhang and others inspected the fire site yesterday and have determined the excavation location, steps, and ash disposal area.</p>
<p>Zhang Naizuo, representative of the Municipal Council, received a letter of introduction from lawyer Zhang Shizhao yesterday, stating that a victim named Ge has important evidence to provide to the Fire Investigation Committee. Ge visited Zhang Naizuo yesterday, but Zhang was out on business, so the nature of the evidence is currently unknown. However, Ge indicated that it would be very powerful evidence of a crime. Details will be clear today. Zhang also told reporters that he learned yesterday that some victims had secretly reported to the Municipal Council that 30 minutes after the fire, two detectives and a patrol officer arrived to watch. After 12:00 AM, dozens of police officers suddenly arrived, stood for ten minutes, and then entered the fire site without the consent of the public. Some people witnessed one of them with the number 1850, and another wearing a police uniform under a short coat, with Western hair and dark skin. When they came out of the fire site, their pockets were full and they looked triumphant, returning to the scene an hour and a half later, suspected of taking advantage of the fire to loot. Zhang has decided to inquire about the details from the Municipal Council today and investigate further.</p>
<p>Collection of Data is Extremely Rich</p>
<p>The Fire Investigation Committee has collected extremely rich data to date. The work from now on will be to pursue the existing clues one by one. For example, the Wang family's wine bottles, the Yan family's uniform, and the split wardrobe will all require questioning firefighters one by one to uncover the facts of the crime. Yesterday, the committee indicated that whether this work will continue to be carried out by the Investigation Committee depends on the mayor's decision.</p>
<h3>According to the Report, More Than 20 People are Suspected</h3>
<p>Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Investigation Committee, submitted part of the investigation report to Mayor Wu yesterday morning. Mayor Wu indicated that Director Xuan could review it first, so after Director Xuan reviewed it, it was submitted to Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon. According to the Investigation Committee, Director Xuan believes that according to this report, there are still more than 20 suspects related to the case who need to be detained and may need to be summoned again today. The police bureau's report on the fire has long been drafted and is expected to be published after the mayor reviews it. Yesterday, reporters made a special visit to Mayor Wu. The mayor stated that the police bureau's report is still under review and has not been completed due to being busy with suppressing rice prices recently. When asked when it could be published, Mayor Wu indicated that it seemed to have no value for publication because the police bureau's representative (Zhang Da, Director of the Supervisory Office) participated in the Fire Investigation Committee, so the Investigation Committee's report must be more detailed, objective, and fair.</p>
<p>The Investigation Committee is About to Dissolve</p>
<p>When asked what his thoughts were on the case, Mayor Wu replied, "It is the joint determination of myself and Director Xuan to thoroughly investigate this case, seek the truth, and prevent future troubles. How things should be resolved still depends on the Investigation Committee's full report." Mayor Wu also stated that the Investigation Committee will dissolve after collecting all the data, and the police bureau will take over the investigative work that still needs to be carried out and the criminal aspects of the case.</p>
<h3>Today, the District Prosecutor's Office Summons Five Victims</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled to summon five victims of the case, Wang Yunfu, Yan Zezhi, Zheng Zaijian, Tang Ruichun, and Zhou Qifang, at 8:00 AM today to inquire about their experiences of being victims and possibly confront the five detained firefighters.</p>

<h3>Morphia King Ye Qinghe's Legacy of Poison? Hidden Opium Case in Flower Bed Opens for Trial; All Three Defendants Claim to Know Nothing About the Origins</h3>
<p>Informant's Name Temporarily Not Announced; Court Hearing Rescheduled for Further Inquiry</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Pei Yuanjun, Zhou Asan, and Shi Zhaoguang, the three suspects in the case of 20,000 taels of opium hidden in a flower bed at 31 Dade Lane, Linsen West Road, were tried in court yesterday. According to the investigation report from the Changshu Branch Bureau that cracked the case, on the 13th of last month, at 5:00 PM, police officer No. 339 reported to the duty room that seven or eight people in military uniforms had entered 31 Dade Lane, claiming to be searching for opium. The bureau sent people to investigate and found that these military personnel were Zheng Zhongwei, the police chief of the Port Management Committee and deputy director of the Garrison Command's Pending Disposal Office, who had received a secret report that a large quantity of opium was hidden in the flower bed at 31 Dade Lane, so he sent people to excavate. The police bureau then jointly searched and found a large amount of opium in wooden boxes under the cement flower bed in the courtyard, weighing a total of 1,058 catties. The owner of the house, Pei Yuanjun, was out and had not returned, so his wife, He Lanjun, was taken to the bureau for questioning. Pei Yuanjun was arrested at the Shenkang Silk Weaving Factory branch at 4 Rongji Lane, Guangdong Road, and the gardener Zhou Asan and Shi Zhaoguang, the original owner of 31 Dade Lane, were also arrested at Hollywood Garden, Yuyuan Road. During yesterday's trial, according to Pei Yuanjun's statement:</p>
<h3>The Eventful Autumn of the Transportation Industry; Beijing-Shanghai Train Damaged in Changzhou; The Entire Line is Delayed for Six Hours; Driver Remains Calm and Fortunately No Accident Occurs; No Loss to Passengers or Freight</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The No. 10 upbound night express train with first, second, and third class cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line departed from the North Station at 9:50 PM the night before last. At 2:27 AM yesterday morning, when it arrived near Changzhou Station, 167 kilometers from Shanghai, the front wheel of the locomotive suddenly broke. The cars attached were affected by this and experienced violent vibrations, almost derailing and overturning. Fortunately, the driver remained calm and handled the situation properly, and no accident occurred. There was no damage to passengers or goods.</p>
<p>The accident site happened to be in the middle of the Beijing-Shanghai double-track traffic area, causing the traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai line to be affected and completely blocked. The train was stopped for as long as six hours. Later, the Qishuyan Car Factory of the Railway Bureau sent a rescue train to rush to repair it, and the entire line's traffic was restored at around 8:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>The damaged area of the locomotive was in the wilderness. After the police department of the bureau heard about it, it urgently dispatched nearby railway police to rush to protect it in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Due to the obstruction of the No. 10 train, traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai line was once interrupted, and all trains were delayed. The No. 9 and No. 11 trains from Beijing to Shanghai the night before last were each delayed by about six hours. The No. 6 and No. 8 early trains from Shanghai to Beijing and the No. 5 and No. 7 early trains from Beijing to Shanghai at the North Station yesterday morning were temporarily suspended for one day.</p>
<p>In order to alleviate passenger congestion, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau opened an additional first, second, and third class temporary express train at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and all tickets already sold for the No. 6 and No. 8 trains were generally valid. It is heard that Nanjing also added a temporary first, second, and third class passenger train at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to carry passengers from Beijing to Shanghai on the No. 5 and No. 7 trains yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Yesterday, passenger trains in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places still operated normally and were not interrupted.</p>
<h3>Temporary Special Train to Cease Operation Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau previously added temporary special trains on the 26th of last month to adjust for congestion. Now, because passenger and freight transportation has returned to its original state, the Railway Bureau has decided to stop operating these temporary special trains starting tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Two Companies' Passenger Planes; Have Not Received Resumption Order; Passenger Registration is Very Congested; Expected Resumption is Not Far Off</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] There is still no confirmation on when Central and China Airlines will be able to resume passenger transportation. The rumor that Central Airlines has received an order from the Ministry of Communications to resume flights yesterday is not true. According to the person in charge of the company, no such order has been received, so no passengers have been carried on the flights that took off in the past two days. However, it is expected that the resumption period is not far off. Since the suspension this time, air transportation has been stagnant for a week, and passengers have been extremely inconvenienced. Those who go to the company to register for passenger seats in advance are very crowded. If the suspension continues for a long time, it will be even more difficult in the future.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the 4th Drama Festival; Decision on Eight Measures; Relief for Poor and Sick Artists</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] This month, the 15th is the 4th Drama Festival. The Municipal Cultural and Sports Committee, the Actors' Association, the Municipal Experimental Drama School, the Theater Commercial Association, the Shanghai Drama and Film Association, and other five groups held an expanded preparatory meeting for the 36th Drama Festival at the New Licha Hotel at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Representatives from Pan Gongzhan, Gu Yuxiu, Xiong Foxi, Tian Han, Hong Shen, the Education Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Garrison Command, the 23rd National Army and other representatives, as well as famous figures in the drama industry and reporters from various newspapers, more than 40 people in total, attended. Eight celebration measures were decided during the meeting, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) A celebration meeting and tea party will be held at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 15th. The location will be determined by the Preparatory Committee. (2) Negotiate with the theater authorities to offer half-price tickets for all daytime performances on that day, and ask the Finance Bureau to exempt taxes. The tax-exempted donations will be used to provide relief to poor and sick artists. (3) From 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the 14th, borrow the Tianchan Stage to hold various large-scale drama performances and grand concerts, organized by representatives from the five groups of the Preparatory Committee, the Entertainment Association, the representatives of the Cinema Commercial Association, and Hong Shen and eight others. (4) A youth cultural evening will be held at the YMCA on the evening of the 15th, hosted by the Municipal Cultural Committee, featuring drama lectures.

(7) Ask various bookstores in the city to hold special sales on that day, selling drama and film-related and other books at discounted prices. (8) Issue a declaration calling for peace.</p>
<p>Finally, it was decided that the five groups that convened the preparatory meeting, the Radio Broadcasting Association, the Cinema Commercial Association, representatives of the Entertainment Association, and Hong Shen and Tian Han would form a formal Preparatory Committee to handle various celebration matters.</p>
<p>Pei Yuanjun stated: He is from Danyang, engaged in silk factory and rayon business, living at 31 Dade Lane, Linsen West Road. The house there was purchased from Shi Zhaoguang in August of the 31st year of the Republic, with a price of 240,000 yuan in counterfeit currency, used by one family. The flower bed in the courtyard was originally there, and he did not know where the opium came from at all. However, during April and May of the 32nd year of the Republic, he had hired the gardener Zhou Asan to plant geraniums in the flower bed. Zhou discovered several pieces of black asphalt-like hard material, but he did not know what they were at the time, so he did not investigate further. He also stated that Zhou Asan had come twice before and after.</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoguang stated: He is 57 years old, engaged in architecture, living at 5 Lane 53, Anfu Road. On April 23rd of last year, he was detained for smoking opium and sentenced to three months of imprisonment. 31 Dade Lane was built at his own expense in the 18th year of the Republic. From January to April of the 19th year, it was rented to a Korean, and in August of the same year, it was rented to Ye Qinghe, known as the "Morphine King," who opened the National Pharmacy on Fourth Horse Road. Later, when a drug case occurred, he fled without a trace. The house was taken back for his own use. He lived there for one month in the 21st year of the Republic. In the 22nd year, it was rented to Wu Songgao of the Academia Sinica. After Wu vacated the lease, it was empty for half a year. Until June of the 31st year, it was sold to Pei Yuanjun. The flower bed in the house was built when the house was built and originally planted with two boxwoods. During his residence, he never discovered any opium or other items.</p>
<p>Zhou Asan stated: He is 47 years old, from Wuxi, engaged in gardening. The flower bed at 31 Dade Lane is three feet high and six feet in circumference. He was introduced to plant geraniums. At that time, a black hard block was excavated from the soil and handed over to Mr. Pei for identification. Because they both did not recognize it as opium, they thought it was waste, so they discarded it. The three all stated that they did not know where the opium in the flower bed came from. The gardener Zhou Asan even claimed that Yuanjun once discovered it, but ignored it because he did not recognize opium. The court then summoned Wang Ruihong, the judicial section chief of the Changshu Branch Bureau, to present the process of cracking the case. Wang stated: The details are all recorded in the investigation report. The first person to receive the secret report in this case was Deputy Director Zheng of the Inspection Office. The name of the informant cannot be announced temporarily.</p>
<h3>Number of Cars in Shanghai Exceeds 20,000</h3>
<p>The reason for the recent shortage of gasoline in the city is due to the increase in the number of new cars. According to the person in charge of the Public Works Bureau, as of the end of December last year, the number of cars in the city was more than 19,000, but as of yesterday, it had increased to 20,836 in January. Among them, there are 2,132 military cars, 1,986 military trucks, 10 military motorcycles, 8,074 private cars, 2,912 private trucks, 100 commercial cars, 2,568 commercial trucks, 1,855 motorcycles, and 199 test vehicles. In the recent month, more than 500 new cars have been shipped from abroad, some of which have not yet been licensed. The import of new cars recently is indeed more than last year.</p>
<p>In addition, the Customs will order its subordinates to pay attention to prevent the import of illegal new cars. All new cars with a value exceeding 2,000 US dollars and incomplete documents will still not be allowed to be imported.</p>
<h3>The Factory Guidance Office Will Investigate Factories</h3>
<p>Once the review and investigation of the outstanding cases previously applied for by various factories to the Shanghai District Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is completed, the office will begin to continue its original factory investigation work. The main parts are divided into production and equipment. Materials are collected separately, forms are compiled and submitted to the ministry, and important references are made to the Shanghai production industry to understand the actual production quantity of each industry and analyze its distribution needs. For factories lacking raw materials, they can claim the accurate estimated standard in advance. According to the factories, there are more than 9,000 units, including more than 40 associations. The ones that were investigated and completed last year have reached more than 3,000 copies.</p>
<p>The court believed that the case was complicated and evidence still needed to be investigated, so it ordered a postponement for further inquiry. Pei Yuanjun and Zhou Asan were returned to custody, and Shi Zhaoguang was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Year-End Bonus for Truck Workers Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The problem of the year-end bonus for truck workers has been delayed until now, and it has been resolved. Labor and management have signed a settlement record. The principles are: (1) The year-end bonus for the 35th year of the Republic will be decided on an individual basis depending on the profit and loss of each trucking company. (2) For those who have not yet paid the year-end bonus or have not yet resolved it, the industry association will be responsible for advising the management to pay it at its discretion.</p>
<h3>The Struggle for Work at Taikoo Wharf; The Mayor Personally Handles the Situation; Orders the Formation of a Review Committee; Foreman Zhou Ruisun Speaks Rudely; Immediately Detained and Sent to the Police Bureau for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The dispute over workers fighting for work at the Taikoo Company Wharf was mediated by Mayor Wu yesterday noon, who summoned Chen Shanyu, the manager of the Taikoo Company's wharf warehouse, Zhou Ruisun, the foreman, and the personnel of the Social Affairs Bureau who were handling the case to the city government conference room. Chen Shanyu claimed that the foremen and laborers under his command and supervision were all people who had been serving at the company's wharf, not newly hired. Zhou Ruisun is not a foreman of the Taikoo Company, and has neither entered into a contracting contract with the company nor established any hire relationship.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhou's claim to be an old worker seems to be incorrect. Zhou Ruisun insisted that he had served at the wharf for many years, and now he demanded that the more than one hundred workers under him still enter the wharf to work. Mayor Wu stated that the Social Affairs Bureau could send personnel to form a committee with the Taikoo Company, the Wharf Workers' Union, and Zhou Ruisun to jointly investigate and identify this group of workers. If they are indeed old workers, they will be registered and Chen Shanyu can employ and distribute work. If they are new workers, they will not be included in this case. Zhou Ruisun suddenly made an extraneous remark during the mediation, claiming that "Chen Shanyu has gold bars, so someone is helping him speak." Mayor Wu was extremely angry when he heard this, and immediately ordered Zhou Ruisun to be detained and sent to the police bureau for investigation, ordering him to produce solid evidence, otherwise he would not be released.</p>
<p>The struggle for work at the Taikoo Company Wharf has been in dispute for a long time. The Social Affairs Bureau issued an instruction on January 27th of the 35th year of the Republic, including a statement ordering Chen and Zhou to cooperate. On February 9th of the same year, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan issued a handwritten order to the Social Affairs Bureau, fearing that disputes would occur and affect Shanghai's materials, ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to transfer the order to Chen and Zhou to be jointly responsible for preventing theft. Regarding the point of cooperation, the instruction stated that "whether Chen and Zhou can cooperate in the future is another issue."</p>
<p>Review Work Yields No Results</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] After Mayor Wu ordered the two parties to form a special investigation committee to identify the workers in the Taikoo Wharf work dispute, Cao Demo and Zhu Bianjun of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Ling Xingyin, the section chief of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, and Mao Jun, the representative of Taikoo, conducted the review work at the Taikoo Company's office at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Huangpu Branch Bureau also sent two patrol officers, Xu Jianzhong and Song Yongfang, leading many police officers to the scene for security. Chen Shanyu, the foreman, also attended. Zhou Ruisun was detained and sent to the police bureau for investigation because he made rude remarks and slandered government officials during the mediation at the city government, so Zhou's party was represented by Zhou Chengxiang, Sun Wenfu, Hou Mengfang, and He Changzhi in the review meeting. Chen Shanyu and Hou Mengfang, the representative of Zhou's party, had another dispute during the review. Hou insisted that the two parties must cooperate in their work and the workers cannot be taken by Chen. Chen believed that Hou's opinion completely overturned the original intention of the mayor's mediation, causing the workers of the bureau not to be willing to accept the review, and it dispersed without results at around 5:00 PM. According to Cao and Zhu of the Social Affairs Bureau, the method of review must be instructed by the mayor again. Whether the review will continue today is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>New and Old Workers Dispute at Datong Shipping Company</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A large group of old workers, including Li Alin, gathered at the Datong Shipping Company on the Bund of Jinling Road at approximately 5:45 PM yesterday, demanding reinstatement. The new workers firmly refused, leading to a dispute. Hao Yunpeng, the group leader of the Datong Joint Transportation Office, arrived at the scene and took the eight leading figures, including Li Alin, to the police station for mediation.</p>
<h3>Disputes Arise Over Unpaid Wages; Rubber Factory Petitions to Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shenhe Rubber Factory previously petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs, proposing to suspend operations at its second factory. After summoning both labor and management to the bureau for questioning, it was learned that this action was not due to losses, but rather because the management was dissatisfied with a small number of workers who demanded payment of overdue wages. The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the management should not use the suspension of operations as a means of dealing with workers. If a few unscrupulous workers are deliberately causing trouble, the factory can petition the Bureau of Social Affairs for handling.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Wuxi Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 140 Binlang Road recently dismissed three workers, including Ma Bingyuan. The management only agreed to provide severance pay equivalent to fifteen days' wages, which the workers firmly refused. The conditions differed too greatly, and after unsuccessful mediation by the union, a petition has been submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs for handling.</p>
<h3>Demand Surges, Transportation Can't Keep Up; Gasoline Supply Disrupted Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The gasoline supply in the city has again become disrupted recently. Yesterday afternoon, the "Gu Pai" gasoline station even temporarily suspended sales. Various sectors have speculated about this situation. Some say it is related to rumors of an impending exchange rate adjustment, while others say it is because the city's oil reserves are depleted. However, according to inquiries by reporters to those in charge of various gasoline companies, they all claimed there was no relationship. The shortage at gas stations is purely due to the recent psychological effect on the general public, which has led to a surge in demand. Gas stations that usually supply 500 gallons per day are now often required to supply more than 1,000 gallons. Therefore, transportation cannot keep up, leading to shortages. This is purely a temporary phenomenon, and normal conditions will soon be restored.</p>
<h3>Grain Loan Case Scheduled for Trial; Can the Defendants Be Acquitted? This Trial Should Provide the Answer</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the indictment of the grain loan corruption case, the District Court held a hearing. After the New Year's amnesty decree was issued, various sectors speculated that the defendants in the case would be acquitted and released, or that the presiding judge might change the articles of indictment. The detained defendants, such as Wang Daren, also applied for bail, which was rejected by presiding judge Wu Xiangzu. It is now known that the District Court has scheduled another hearing for 9:30 AM on the 12th of this month, and subpoenas have been issued. Whether the defendants in the case can be acquitted and released will be revealed in this trial. Those summoned this time include the defendants Wan Molin, Wang Daren, Ren Xingyai, Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzao, Wu Rongsheng, Xing Zhigang, and Yang Jian. The witnesses are Zhu Yongming, Gu Yisheng, Chuan Changyu, Zhang Sheng, Yu Liangji, Zhang Chao, Xu Yuanshou, Zhu Shilu, Ren Yuzhen, Lu Linxun, Qi Songwen, and Shao Jigao.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Claims Robbery to Evade Debt</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A certain old woman reported a robbery to the Hongkou Sub-bureau around 7 PM the night before. She identified herself as Li Hai (62 years old, from Wuxi), residing at No. 9, Lane 321, Wuchang Road, Hongkou. She claimed that she had just returned home from Suzhou when she was ambushed by two robbers lying in wait at the entrance of the lane. They intercepted her, robbed her of a net bag containing three million yuan in legal tender, and tied her up with rope, throwing her to the ground. They also stuffed her mouth with newspapers to prevent her from calling for help. Later, a neighbor came out and helped her up and released her. She came to the bureau to request an investigation. Section Chief Shi, along with patrol officers Jiang Tianfu and Jiang Darren, went to the scene of the incident to investigate and discovered that her report was false. Under strict questioning, Li confessed the truth. She had previously borrowed money from others and traveled between the Beijing-Shanghai railway as a peddler, but she had lost everything. Creditors were demanding repayment, and she was unable to cope. She came up with the idea of falsely claiming she was going to Suzhou to borrow money on the afternoon before, but instead spent the night sleeping at the North Railway Station. She then returned to her residence, claiming she had been robbed, hoping to delay her creditors and find a way to repay them. The sub-bureau, due to her disruption of public order, has scheduled a report to the judicial authorities for review.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Specialized Tricycle Theft; Stolen Goods Stored at the Police Station Awaiting Collection</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shi Junrong, the head of the Criminal Division of the Hongkou Police Bureau, received a tip the night before that a tricycle thief named Chen Wenjian was hiding in a shack in Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. At approximately 2 PM yesterday, he dispatched patrol officer Gu Zhongshu to lead police to the address. Chen was out, so his wife, Wang Xiuying, was taken to the bureau for questioning. According to Wang's confession, four tricycles and a large number of spare parts were seized. The stolen tricycle numbers are 302, 16178, 2986, and 438. Owners of tricycle companies can go to the sub-bureau to claim them.</p>

<h3>Ash Pond Mistaken for Cesspool; Limestone Business Owner Detained; Investigator Suspected of False Reporting; Eight Senators Move to Investigate Strictly; Third District Public Works Management Office Responds that it was a Typographical Error</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Eight city senators, Xie Dahuang, Chen Boliang, Huang Bingquan, and others, have filed a temporary emergency motion requesting a thorough investigation into the alleged false reporting by a city Public Works Bureau investigator, which resulted in the infringement of a citizen's personal freedom. According to the report of Senator Xie and others: "According to Zhang Nairen, a representative of the residents of the Ninth District: There is an ash pond in front of the Jiankang Limestone Business at the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Huashan Road. The Public Works Bureau, based on the investigator's report, identified it as a cesspool placed on the street. The Changning District Police Sub-bureau detained Huang Tingsheng, the owner of the business, without asking the reason, and sentenced him to fourteen days of detention. After the district representative pleaded with the police bureau to send personnel to verify that it was not a cesspool, they still detained him for one day before releasing him because the Public Works Bureau had already issued a document. It is already strange that the investigator cannot distinguish between ash and feces, and even if it were feces placed on the street, it would be a matter of hygiene, why not notify the Health Bureau to investigate and ban it? It is suspected that they attempted to solicit bribes without success and used false accusations in retaliation. It is extremely necessary to conduct a thorough investigation to protect the personal freedom of the people."</p>
<p>After the Public Works Bureau's Third District Public Works Management Office investigated the case, it responded: "The Jiankang Brick and Ash Business at the intersection of Linsen West Road and Panyu Road had piled up brick materials and set up an ash pond on the sidewalk, obstructing traffic. We have repeatedly ordered them to move it, but they have not complied. We have often reported to the bureau and forwarded it to the two police headquarters, ordering the Changning Road Sub-bureau to ban it. Later, this office sent another letter to the Changning Road Sub-bureau for banning. Unexpectedly, the editor mistakenly wrote "ash pond" as "cesspool." However, the documents submitted to the bureau by this office and the main bureau, which were forwarded to the two police bureaus, all stated "ash pond," not "cesspool." Moreover, the document specified the intersection of Linsen West Road and Panyu Road, not the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Huashan Road, which shows that the investigators did not make any false reports. In addition to issuing a major demerit to the editor to show punishment, this office is not aware of the detention of the owner of the Jiankang Limestone Business at the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Huashan Road by the Changning Road Sub-bureau. We are reporting to request verification."</p>

<h3>City Council Reviews Budget, Inspects Various Bureaus and Offices of the Municipal Government</h3>

<h3>Finance Bureau Explains Again the Valuation Method for House Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the assessment standards for the autumn house tax and municipal construction tax in the 35th year, Director Gu of the Finance Bureau has repeatedly explained this at the Council meetings. Because some citizens are still unclear about the assessment method, they inquired with the City Council. After the Council inquired with Director Gu, Director Gu gave another explanation: The house tax and municipal construction tax in the autumn of the 235th year are calculated by multiplying the rental value determined in the 26th year after re-evaluation, not according to the actual rent or original assessed price at that time. The figures listed on the former Public Works Bureau's general tax ticket are actually the actual rental figures used by the former Public Works Bureau at that time, which is different from the assessed rental value based on by the Finance Bureau. The house tax and municipal construction tax for the winter of the 35th year will still be assessed and collected according to the autumn method.</p>

<h3>Pro-Enemy White Russian on Trial; Claims Someone Else Committed the Accused Crimes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] White Russian Baode Xidafu was tried at the High Court yesterday morning for aiding the enemy. The defendant once served as a police officer in the Harbin Police Bureau. After the "September 18th" Incident, he defected to the enemy and served as an informant in the enemy gendarmerie in Harbin. Later, he was detained by the enemy for excessive smuggling and extortion from the people. Before long, he took the opportunity to escape to Shanghai and worked in the criminal section of the enemy gendarmerie in the Broadway Building, specializing in the trial of arrested foreigners. Those who were poisoned by him are unknown. He also relied on the power of the enemy and puppet forces to embezzle the resources of metal merchants and engage in smuggling, repeatedly obtaining huge profits. In April of the 31st year, he led the enemy to extort from the Kepo Paint Factory and the Westerner Billy Yang in the Cathay Hotel, Ladu Road. In addition, he extorted money from gambling dens and private individuals on many occasions. The defendant denied all the crimes charged in the indictment, saying that the photos published in the newspapers were of his cousins and that the evildoer was another person with the same name. The court ordered that the case still needs to be investigated and postponed for retrial. The defendant requested to see his family and embraced and kissed his wife, talking briefly before the bailiff urged them to separate.</p>
<h3>Resumption Island Case Postponed and Ended; Executive Yuan Will Go to Guangdong Again for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Resumption Island mystery case has gone through several twists and turns in March. Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao personally visited the island three times to investigate. The case seems to be clear: there is no possibility of hiding gold in the bathtub, and the leakage of materials is indeed suspicious. Moreover, due to personnel friction, mutual infighting, and false accusations under assumed names, the mystery case has become more complicated, adding a lot of mystery. After the handwriting report from the Forensic Research Institute was replied to the District Prosecutor's Office, it was confirmed that "Bai Zhicai" in the secret report was Zheng Xinmin's pseudonym. The prosecutor also had a plan for the corruption part, and originally intended to close the case within days. However, Yu Loxing, the member of the Executive Yuan responsible for investigating the case, suddenly visited the prosecutor yesterday and requested a postponement of the closing of the case. It is said that the authorities of the Executive Yuan intend to go to Guangzhou again to investigate, because there are still important figures related to the case now in Guangzhou.</p>

<h3>A Coat and Two Pairs of Overshoes; Prostitute Duped by Clever Scam</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Lin Wenyuan brothel at No. 4, Fuxiang Lane, Guangxi Road, received a call the night before from a Shen-surnamed traveler in room 426 of the Oriental Hotel, requesting a prostitute to accompany him. The brothel sent two prostitutes, but both were rejected for their ordinary looks. Finally, Chen Aying (19 years old, from Taicang), who had not been in the business for long, was sent, and the Shen traveler was finally satisfied. He immediately paid 30,000 yuan for the night. After a night of pleasure, the Shen traveler, who claimed to be named Guo Bin, from Nanjing, and currently working in a military agency in Nanjing, said that because he was still single, he had been frequenting brothels for several years, hoping to find a partner. He said that after seeing her today, he wished to spend the rest of his life with her, and to show his sincerity, he agreed to buy her a fur coat first tomorrow. The woman believed him to be true. After getting up yesterday morning, they went out together. The woman was wearing a old and outdated Haihu velvet coat. However, with the thought that she was about to transform from a goddess into a military officer's wife, the woman was overjoyed that her old Haihu velvet coat would be renewed. When the couple arrived at the Kuifa Barber Shop at No. 396, Henan North Road, the traveler said again: "To try on new clothes, one must look radiant, so please have your hair permed first." The woman agreed. When the barber started using electric tongs, the Shen traveler suddenly took off the woman's Haihu velvet coat, saying that he would go to the fashion company first to choose a size with this old coat. At the same time, he instructed the shop apprentice to go with him. The woman still had no doubt. After the Shen traveler left, he and the apprentice went to the Baoshan Road Qiujiang Road No. 119 department store and bought two pairs of tall men's overshoes, priced at 150,000 yuan. When paying, he suddenly said to the store clerks: "Because I left in a hurry, I didn't bring cash. Can you send someone with this barber shop apprentice to my wife to get the money?" The store clerks, seeing that the visitor was calm and the apprentice was unaware of the inside story, returned to the store with the department store staff, and this highly skilled con artist took the Haihu velvet coat and two pairs of tall overshoes and calmly walked away. When the department store staff went to the barber shop to ask Chen for the overshoes payment, the scam was exposed. The enraged Chen reported to the North Railway Station Police Sub-bureau, requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>Children's "Sha Zi" (Measles)</h3>
<p>— You Xuezhou</p>
<p>Coughing and choking are symptoms that a child with measles should have. If the cough is not frequent, occurring every few minutes with three or four coughs, and the cough is moist with balanced breathing and does not interfere with sleep, it will definitely not affect their health and will not cause changes in the course of the measles. The physiological function of coughing and choking is to eliminate obstacles in the respiratory system, expelling them from the body through the outburst of coughing. Coughing and choking in children with measles also has the function of assisting the eruption of rashes. If it is not too severe, it is beneficial and not harmful, so there is no need to use cough suppressants to eliminate it. If the coughing and choking are frequent, and the cough is not moist, or if the throat is sore and painful due to excessive coughing, and the voice is hoarse, or if the stomach is shaken due to severe coughing, causing nausea and vomiting, the situation may seem very tense. However, the eruption of rashes does not change because of this, and if the breathing is even and there are no signs of shortness of breath or rapid breathing, there is still no major problem with proper treatment. If the coughing and choking are accompanied by rapid breathing and nasal flaring, and the coughing persists after the rashes have appeared, these are all adverse signs and should be carefully noted!</p>
<p>Colds can cause coughing, so children with measles should avoid wind and cold. However, excessive care, such as wrapping the sick child tightly in heavy bedding or placing a stove in the room, causing external heat to force inward, resulting in coughing due to panting, is also often seen. Dense smoke is most likely to irritate the respiratory tract and exacerbate coughing and choking. It is common to see that in cramped rooms, where many people gather, the air is already very foul. Entering such a room often causes dizziness and nausea. If dense smoke is used for fumigation, it is not advisable to use this method, especially for children with severe coughing and choking. According to customs, families with measles do not "heat the wok with oil" when cooking, in order to avoid the stimulation of oily fumes and prevent an increase in coughing and choking.</p>
<p>The occurrence of measles is often induced by colds. For those who also have a cough, boil a few scallions, crushed, into thin porridge and drink it. This can relieve the cold and also help the measles to erupt, achieving two things with one action. If the cough is caused by heat, most will have a red face and rapid breathing, and the measles rashes will be dense and bright red. Cooling drinks, such as sugarcane juice and pear juice, are suitable. The degree of coldness of the drink and whether to take it warm or cold should be determined based on the degree of heat. It is also good to grind almonds with water, extract the juice, and drink it. If the heat is severe, it will be dry, and the body fluids will be consumed, so those who cough due to dryness will have a dry, non-moist cough, and the tongue will be light red. It is especially suitable to give them sweet and cool sugarcane juice and pear juice. For those who cough with a lot of phlegm, the key is to dispel the phlegm. Grind radish into juice, add three to five drops of dried ginger juice, and take it warm. Be careful when using it for children with measles who have loose stools. Those who cough with a lot of phlegm should not eat too much oily food. In the early stages of measles, oily food should be prohibited. Even in the later stages of measles, when the rashes have subsided and the appetite has increased, oily foods should still be prohibited for those who cough with a lot of phlegm.</p>
<h3>Asthma and Wheezing</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>Recently, the cold weather has made the most common ailments colds and flu. Severe cases may be persistent coughs (chronic bronchitis in Western medicine) or asthma and wheezing (bronchial asthma in Western medicine). These are not short-term epidemics. Those afflicted often suffer from them and experience great pain. To seek a cure, they must pay attention to treatment methods over a long period, which vary from person to person, place to place, and profession to profession. Therefore, those who cure these stubborn ailments have experience superior to that of ordinary doctors!</p>
<p>Childhood asthma, wheezing, shortness of breath, and panting are all symptoms of the same condition. Some are inherited, and some are caused by cold, lung weakness, or infection. Inherited cases are the most common: often, several siblings, though with varying degrees of severity, all have the condition. Sometimes, only one sibling is affected, or it may skip a generation. In general, if parents have this condition, they must be most careful to prevent their children from catching a cold. If it breaks out once, it will easily occur every winter. They must also prevent specific odors from affecting them. Overeating salty foods can cause "salty asthma," and eating large amounts of sweets can cause "sweet asthma." Suddenly exposed to oily fumes can make the trachea uncomfortable, leading to "oily asthma," or it can be caused by ash, dust, or feathers sticking to the trachea. These are all patterns of attacks in childhood, with salty asthma and oily wheezing being the most common! Parents with asthma should carefully avoid these things for their children! But ephedra and asarum can easily cure oily asthma in children at the beginning, and dried snail, pumpkin stem, mantis ootheca, and evodia rutaecarpa can cure salty asthma in children within three years. These are all proven formulas!</p>
<p>It is easier to treat in childhood. The most important condition is that daily life must maintain a certain level of warmth. In winter, one cannot go outside, and the indoor climate should be kept at an average of 65 degrees. Therefore, it is necessary to have them study at home for the first one or two years of onset. If it has been more than three years, it is easy to become a lifelong condition, making it difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Middle Age. For middle-aged asthma sufferers, the cause may no longer be relevant. The most important thing to seek treatment is prevention and prompt treatment of the initial attack. What is prevention? In the summer, buy about ten pounds of old ginger, add a little water, mash it to extract the juice, and drain a bowl of yellow liquid. Then, use cotton to soak up the ginger juice, dry it in the sun, and soak up the ginger juice again. Do this three times, then spread the yellow cotton flat and make small cotton vests. Wear one of them in the fall. They are uniquely warm and can effectively protect the lungs from cold and prevent asthma. This is a method that many people have experienced.</p>
<p>When autumn arrives, be most careful to prevent cold winds from directly affecting the lungs when the first autumn wind rises. Asthma is most likely to occur. In late autumn or early winter, immediately consult a doctor and take astragalus membranaceus, aconite, and ginger preparations for prevention. Once you catch a cold, you should immediately take ephedra and asarum preparations. The sooner, the better, because if you delay for a day, phlegm and fluids will surge and flow into the lungs. The more phlegm there is, the worse the asthma will be. When phlegm enters the lungs, breathing is not smooth. Asthmatics use it to assist breathing and to agitate the phlegm, turning it into a bubble state so that it is easier to cough up. Therefore, asthmatic coughs during the day often produce several bowls full of phlegm, which are initially bubbles like thin phlegm, but become calm overnight and completely turn into liquid.</p>
<p>Asthma most fears unregulated air. It is not suitable to live in an extremely warm, stove-heated room, nor is it suitable to go out into the wind and rain occasionally. Wu Tiecheng suffered from high blood pressure and asthma and took refuge in Shanghai, sitting under a glass awning to bask in the sun and keep warm, which was a good strategy. When spring warms up, the disease is easily cured.</p>
<p>Asthma is cured when it is transformed by heat. Thin phlegm becomes thick phlegm, and clear white phlegm becomes sticky yellow phlegm. When it can be coughed up easily, the recovery period is not far off. Therefore, taking warm and hot medicines is most likely to promote recovery.</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Kehui's invention of ephedrine from ephedra made him famous worldwide and achieved a temporary effect. The whole world considered it a good treatment, but there is still no radical cure. However, using ephedra with aconite and lepidium seed in traditional Chinese medicine has the possibility of a radical cure! (1) Use it as much as possible during the first attack each winter, which can be cured. After recovery, it is absolutely necessary to regulate the temperature at home, avoid cold and wind, and wait for the arrival of spring. In the second winter and early autumn when it is cold, you still need to regulate the temperature at home. Although this is difficult to do in practice, you should know that if you get infected for three to five years, you will definitely get sick every winter for a month or two, which is truly a lifelong ailment. (2) After the attack in the first (second) winter, as soon as spring warms up, you must take medicine to regulate and accelerate the treatment of phlegm, warmth, and shortness of breath to prevent it from becoming a chronic bronchitis, so that there is a risk of recurrence in summer and autumn.</p>
<p>Elderly. The elderly are weaker in qi and blood, and their yang qi is weak. The so-called fire qi is gradually insufficient, just like the firing part of a machine has less power, and the whole body feels insufficient in yang qi. The ability to transport and transform is reduced, and the ability to promote is weaker. The food and water consumed often cannot be warmed and transported, leading to wheezing and accumulation of water in the trachea, brewing into phlegm. This kind of phlegm is cold in nature, and what is coughed up is white and foamy like crab roe. After coughing up, what sinks is all liquid. When not coughed up, it gathers in the lungs and stomach, sticking together and not dissolving. Over time, it accumulates more and more, and the phlegm becomes harder, eventually forming lumps, which are medically known as "phlegm-fluid," hidden in the lungs and not dissipating for a long time. The lungs lose their ability to breathe healthily, and there is a gurgling sound all day long, and the phlegm is coughed up continuously. When winter comes and the north wind rises, the cold from the outside makes it even less able to warm and transport water, producing even more phlegm. A slight cold will cause a cough, which is further obstructed by phlegm, causing the qi mechanism to be reversed, resulting in wheezing and asthma. The phlegm in the throat gurgles like a "sawing sound." However, during the day, the phlegm lump is still in the lower part of the stomach or lungs. If you lie flat at night, the phlegm-fluid spreads over the upper part of the lungs and stomach, and the qi mechanism is even more obstructed, making the asthma worse. Wheezing makes it impossible to close your eyes and even impossible to lie flat. In addition, due to the decline of yang qi in old age, if the person has a kidney deficiency, there will be a state of kidney not receiving qi. The shortness of breath during asthma is indescribable, and the qi in the dantian has no ability to absorb it, as if it makes the person unable to catch their breath. The suffering is truly unbearable. All people over forty years old often have this condition in winter. The symptoms are varied as described above, but the source of the disease is the decline of yang qi, the inability to warm and transport, and the lack of fire in the body!</p>
<p>The treatment for this disease lies entirely in the method of "strengthening the fire and warming the yang." Stopping wheezing, moistening the lungs, resolving phlegm, and calming cough are not the fundamental ways to treat this disease. In autumn, it is advisable to take about twenty doses of warm tonic medicines, or often take "aconite fried rice flour," with two taels of aconite powder and eight taels of fried rice flour (i.e., ordinary rice fried and ground into powder), mixed evenly. Those with mild conditions can take it in thirty days, and those with severe conditions can take it in fourteen days, once a day, either dry or mixed with warm water, all of which have very effective results! Except for teenagers with phlegm-fire coughs who have a history of hemoptysis, elderly asthma sufferers often take this powder, which has miraculous results. When winter comes, take "strengthening the fire and warming the yang" medicines again. Seek medical advice for the prescription of such medicines, which may include aconite, cinnamon, ginger, ephedra, and lepidium seed, in order to fundamentally treat this disease. Otherwise, the root of the disease will become deeply entrenched year by year, becoming more and more severe, which is not advisable. However, if one is unable to afford medical treatment and medicine, there is a prescription called "Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan," which is effective to take three qian every day.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>— Cen Zhiliang</p>
<p>Although science is flourishing in the world, Chinese medicine is still popular among the Chinese people and can be sold abroad, without being eliminated by the times. This is because the efficacy of the medicine is remarkable, and it does not pursue superficial and quick effects for a temporary solution. It is also good at treating combined and complex diseases, as well as multiple contradictory and mixed symptoms. It also has no side effects or drastic qualities. Plant products are more common than mineral products, which is suitable for the physique of the Chinese people. It enriches the country and benefits the people, improves health, and promoting Chinese medicine is the responsibility of the Chinese people!</p>
<h3>After Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>Since the victory, the ban on smoking has been strict. Most people who have addictions want to quit as soon as possible to avoid punishment and become new citizens. However, there are many people whose bodies become stronger after quitting, but there are also not a few people whose weak bodies develop diseases as a result. People take health as the first priority, and smokers are no exception. I am taking the liberty of offering a few words about the conditioning methods after quitting smoking for your consideration. People who quit smoking and have a yang deficiency will definitely see neurasthenia, night sweats, seminal emission, forgetfulness, and worry. They should often seek medical treatment and take various tonics and longan lotus seed soup. People who have a yin deficiency after quitting smoking will definitely see palpitations, restlessness, constipation, irregular periods, weakness of the limbs, and tearing. They should also seek medical treatment and conditioning, and often eat eggs, black tea, and red dates as snacks. There are also people with both yin and yang deficiencies and special symptoms. It is safer to use traditional Chinese medicine for conditioning. If you condition yourself properly within half a year after quitting, there will be no future troubles. In general, people who quit smoking replace smoking with alcohol, and get drunk every day. They can gain weight at the time, but the nerves become weaker day by day. As a result, the abdomen will become large, or shortness of breath will appear, or the spleen will leak, or it will turn into kidney disease, edema, and bloating. These symptoms cannot be prevented. People who quit smoking should pay attention to them.</p>
<h3>Early Stage of Damp-Warm Disease</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhichao</p>
<p>The early stage of damp-warm disease is all caused by careless diet, fatigue, and exposure to cold. The symptoms are fever, aversion to cold, no sweat, headache, heavy body, chest tightness, dull stomach, fatigue of the limbs, greasy mouth coating, white tongue coating, not much thirst, and soft and rapid pulse. At this time, the damp-warm disease has already formed, but it is still mild. If it can be conditioned properly, it will soon recover. If things are delayed or the treatment is not correct or the conditioning is not complete, the disease will progress and become a major problem.</p>
<p>Most of those with severe damp-warm disease are people from the middle and lower classes, who either rely on their physical strength and do not pay attention, or are trapped by economic difficulties and have no ability to condition and take medicine. They still work while suffering from cold and heat, which is common.</p>
<p>For the early stage of damp-warm disease, use Huoxiang Zhengqi Tang (Agastache rugosa, Magnolia officinalis, Pinellia ternata, Eupatorium fortunei, Perilla frutescens, Angelica dahurica, Amomum villosum, Citrus reticulata, Stir-fried Shen Qu, Poria cocos) plus Forsythia suspensa, Talcum, Benincasa hispida, and Akebia trifoliata. For those with fullness in the epigastrium and abdomen, loose stools, red urine, and aversion to cold that has not subsided, use Cinnamomum cassia, Agastache rugosa, Eupatorium fortunei, Magnolia officinalis, Aucklandia lappa, Areca catechu, Poria cocos, Polyporus umbellatus, and Talcum to resolve the evil in both the exterior and interior.</p>
<h3>Differentiation of Measles, Rubella, Smallpox, and Eruptions</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zanchen</p>
<p>The most important thing to note in the symptoms of skin rashes, apart from the color, is the difference between spots, eruptions and swelling. Conventionally, any pathological condition that occurs on the surface of the skin is collectively referred to as a rash. For clarity, any red spots, whether dense or sparse (such as in measles or scarlet fever), and anything that forms a granular particle (such as in smallpox or chickenpox), is classified as an eruption. Anything that is raised in lumps, like broad beans or cloud flakes, is classified as a spot. A list is given below:</p>
<p>Measles Measles, also known as Sha Zi, is when the fever rises again when the rash appears. The site where the rash appears is initially visible behind the earlobes and on the face, especially around the lips. Next, it appears on the chest, back, abdomen, and limbs in order. Initially, they are sparse red spots without a halo, looking like flea bites, gradually becoming dense and translucent, with a slightly purplish-red color.</p>
<p>Scarlet Fever When scarlet fever rashes appear, the fever also rises again, lingering for four or five days before receding. The order in which the rash appears is from the neck, chest, back, abdomen, and buttocks. It spreads throughout the body in one or two days, with less on the face and none on the nose, lips, or chin. Initially, there is still space between the skin, but after half a day or a day, they gradually merge together. The inner side of the thighs and upper arms is particularly dense. Upon close inspection, only tiny, dot-like eruptions are visible. In the less dense areas, one can still recognize tiny, needle-head-sized, raised eruptions, all red, like erysipelas.</p>
<p>Rubella The symptoms of rubella are very mild. The rash appears at the same time as the fever, or one or two days later. They appear as small dots, red in color, larger than scarlet fever rashes and smaller than measles rashes, slightly round or oval in shape. They are not as raised as measles rashes, nor as dense as scarlet fever. Initially, they are seen on the head, and in half a day or a day, they spread throughout the body.</p>
<p>Smallpox After the smallpox rash appears, the body temperature drops at the same time. The rash initially appears on the forehead, nose, and ears, followed by the face, gradually extending to the back, upper limbs, abdomen, and finally to the lower limbs and feet. A special feature is that no rash appears in the armpits. Initially, it starts as a small rash and quickly turns into a pea-sized, round, shiny, and glossy nodule.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Returning from the National Assembly</h3>
<p>— Ding Zhongying</p>
<p>I attended the National Assembly in Nanjing and visited various places. I know for certain that national medical colleges and pharmaceutical colleges are springing up like bamboo shoots after the rain. The teaching materials they are equipped with are all from Europe and America, and there is not a single item about our country's medicines and prescriptions. Diseases have local diseases, regional diseases, and national habit symptoms. It is inappropriate not to adopt the nation's inherent skills and therapeutic materials and to make the teaching materials of medical colleges have no national component.</p>

<h3>Strong Local Sales, High Prices Outside the Area, Gold Prices Rise Again by More Than 300,000, US Dollars Follow, Hong Kong Tickets Also Rise</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the Central Bank's supply of funds was reduced again, and the buying interest was even stronger, creating a high price. After noon, a slight control was added, and there was a slight recovery. The opening price was 4.43 million to 4.45 million. With many floating profits, they took the opportunity to sell and immediately reported downstream, retreating into 4.4 million, and the low price once retreated to 4.35 million. But then it still struggled. After 10 o'clock, after the Central Bank allocated 1,100 bars at a price of 4.39 million, the buying spree started again. The 4.4 million mark and the 4.5 million mark were soon broken. The supply side was even more helpless, and the pressure was unprecedented. People's hearts were greatly panicked, and the scramble to buy was even more urgent. At noon, the 4.7 million mark was broken, and the exchange once reached as high as 4.81 million before slightly falling back. At exactly 2 o'clock, the next-day delivery was opened, and the Central Bank immediately increased control, once falling as low as 4.62 million, but the selling interest was very temporary and returned to 4.76 million before stabilizing slightly. As a result, the closing price rose again by 310,000 compared to the previous one. Jewelry was listed at 490,000, and silver dollars also rose to the fourth level. The interest rate for hidden discounts was still flat, from about 1.5 to 1.8.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also rose sharply yesterday. The open market for US dollars opened at 7,900 to 8,000 in the morning, rising rapidly to a high price of 8,500 to 8,800 at noon. Although the price of gold fell slightly in the afternoon, the market for banknotes did not change much. As a result, the closing price rose by 700 yuan compared to the previous one. Hong Kong tickets also started a fierce buying spree. There were not many chips, and the price rose from around 1,550 yuan to 1,700 yuan. As a result, it also rose by 180 yuan. In addition to Hong Kong telegraphic transfers rising to 1,600 yuan, Indian remittances were 1,950 yuan, and British remittances were 25,600 yuan. All were in demand but not supplied.</p>
<h3>Observations on the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Over the past two days, gold prices have soared. This reporter made a special visit to a leader in the gold industry to inquire about the reasons. According to him, the recent surge in the gold market is solely due to robust actual sales, with a particularly large number of shipments to other locations, both domestically and abroad. It is estimated that since the Lunar New Year, the daily turnover of gold bars in the market has consistently been around three to four thousand bars. Among these, aside from the one to twelve hundred bars sold by various silver shops, the majority flows to various parts of the country. The supply of these large amounts of gold bars mostly comes from the Central Bank. However, in the past two days, the Central Bank has rarely sold gold in the afternoon, apart from the one thousand-plus allotted in the morning. Yesterday afternoon, all sales were halted. However, the market demand was extremely high, causing prices to skyrocket. The future trend will still depend on market demand and the supply situation from the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Show Slight Rise</h3>
<p>Public bonds showed some activity yesterday, with approximately one million yuan in transactions. Unified Bonds C traded at 1860 yuan, while the 604 series saw supply and fell to 1760 yuan. The 552 series advanced, fluctuating between 1820 yuan and 1850 yuan at the close, resulting in a comparison to the previous close of A and B flat, Unified Bond C up 30 yuan, Unified Bond D up 100 yuan, and Unified Bond E up 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Uptrend Gains Momentum</h3>
<p>Green, red, and white sugars all saw upward movement, with increases ranging from 17,000 to 34,000 yuan. The guild set the price for spot medium white sugar at 152,000 yuan, rising to 158,000 yuan and reaching 165,000 yuan in the afternoon. Warehouse receipts peaked at 153,000 yuan, later falling to 149,000 yuan. 24 Crude White was priced at 210,000 yuan, Four-and-a-Half Cart White at 225,000 yuan, Three-and-a-Half Army White at 185,000 to 190,000 yuan, Shunde Green at 100,450 yuan, Shantou Green at 100,678 yuan, and Branch Red at 125,000 yuan. A total of several thousand bags were traded, along with 300+ baskets of chemical white sugar at 160,000 to 155,000 yuan and several hundred bags of Diao Green at 100,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Sentiment Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Recently, the tea market has shown a frequently positive trend. The reason for this is the significant fluctuations in gold and commodity prices, which have caused market sentiment to strengthen. Holders of goods are even more reluctant to sell than before, leading to a decline in supply. On the buyer side, in addition to continued inquiries from various export firms, local shops, noting the sustained sales at their storefronts, are also showing interest in replenishing their stock. As a result, there is a growing situation of too many monks and not enough porridge, leading to insufficient supply. Transactions are sparse, like stars at dawn, and selling prices are becoming increasingly sharp.</p>
<h3>Gold Price in Nanjing Exceeds 500,000</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The asking price for gold in Nanjing is 500,400, and the bid price is 466,000. The asking price for U.S. dollars is 8,500, and the bid price is 8,400.</p>
<h3>Reduced Price of British Silver</h3>
<p>Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd. Officials have announced that the official price of pure silver has been reduced from 55.5 pence per ounce to 44 pence per ounce. According to well-informed sources, the purpose of this measure by British authorities is to bring British silver prices closer to those in New York. During the war, Britain borrowed a large amount of silver from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act, which must be repaid in the coming years.</p>
<h3>Allocation Extension Leads to Gold Price Hike, Silk Soars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold price soared, and silk prices followed, all reaching new highs. 120 Oriental Rayon with Luster traded at 4.15 million yuan in the morning, reaching 4.20 million yuan by noon, and another 100,000 yuan higher in the afternoon. Gaoshan and others traded at 4.05 million yuan in the morning and asked for 4.20 million yuan in the afternoon. 150 Luster and 75 Semi-Luster were even asking for 6 million yuan, refusing to sell. Yesterday, stimulated by the gold price, market sentiment was unusually excited. Furthermore, the Central Trust Bureau's extension of the 21st allocation period led to an opportunity to raise prices, soaring upwards. Due to limited actual sales, the factory-direct market was relatively calm. C-grade was asking for 5.55 million yuan, and D-grade 5.50 million yuan, roughly 50,000 to 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Gan Jing was offered at 4.2 million yuan for five bundles and 4 million yuan for another bundle. Very few transactions occurred. Silk goods were affected by the soaring raw material prices, and trading was quite active, so factory prices have all been raised. Meiya bedspreads were asking for as much as 400,000 yuan, with transactions at 350,000 yuan. Dachenge crepe sold for 13,500 yuan, and miscellaneous brands traded at 2,500 yuan. Artificial silk bedspreads rose sharply by 50,000 yuan. Sheng Hangzhou goods also increased, with Sheng goods rising by 2-3,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan per piece, and Hangzhou goods by 200 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>Central Bank President Bei Zuyi Summoned to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The President of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, was summoned yesterday at 12:30 pm and hastily departed for Nanjing at 1:30 pm. Accompanying him were Luo Jishi, Economic Advisor to the Executive Yuan, and Secretary Lu Dingzhong. The mission of this trip is unclear, but it is widely believed to be related to stabilizing the current economic and financial situation in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Committee Changes to Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>The Official Establishment Date Awaits Bei's Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Export Promotion Committee was originally scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Central Bank yesterday at 3:30 pm. However, due to the temporary departure of Committee Chairman Zu-yi to Nanjing, it was temporarily changed to a preparatory meeting. Liu Gongyun, Lin Fengbao, Shen Xirui, Jin Shixuan (Counselor of the Ministry of Transportation), Ma Baozhi (Director of Agriculture and Forestry), Yan Jia-gan (Director of Finance of Taiwan Province), Zhang Silv, and Central Bank Economic Advisor Mike, among others, attended and discussed until around 6 pm before adjourning. It is reported that the discussion focused on how to cooperate with the Ministries of Chen Lin Transportation to increase the production of export goods on the one hand and to solve transportation problems on the other. The official establishment meeting will be determined after Chairman Bei Zuyi returns to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Joint Distribution Office Distributes Edible Oil by District</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Distribution Office began handling the distribution of edible oil in the city, Pudong, and suburban areas yesterday. It is estimated that there are more than 400 retail stores in each distribution area. Each store is still allocated one barrel each of soybean oil and sesame oil, each barrel weighing 350 catties. The total allocation volume is estimated to be over 3,000 dan. The allocation price is 180,000 yuan per dan for soybean oil and 165,000 yuan per dan for sesame oil. It is hoped that the distribution procedures will be completed today. It is also learned that the Central Trust Bureau sold 2,000 dan of Northeastern soybeans at a flat price yesterday, so the soybean price stopped rising, and the oil price also tended to stabilize.</p>
<h3>After Large-Scale Sales and Strict Supervision, the Rice Market Has Gradually Stabilized. Businesses Exceeding the Price Limit Have Been Warned. The Market for Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Is Also Gradually Weakening.</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to the recent high rice prices, the Bureau of Social Affairs sent personnel to inspect various districts and supervise transactions in the north and south markets. However, because the negotiated price on January 10th was far from the black market price, and the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai after the Lunar New Year was extremely small, most rice merchants were reluctant to release their goods, except for the Xian rice sold by the Bureau of Social Affairs. There were almost no transactions in the market. Many rice shops secretly hoarded white japonica rice, unwilling to supply it. The black market price still hovered around 90,000 yuan. Some vendors, taking advantage of the high prices, sold their stocks, and the price has slightly declined. It is generally expected that the rice price in the city has reached its peak, and large quantities of rice from various rice-producing areas will soon arrive. Moreover, the large quantity of national rice allocated by the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation has been shipped from Wuxi and will soon be sold in the city, so the rice price is expected to return to normal in the coming days.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs continued to sell 3,430 bags of Siamese rice and over 800 bags of soybeans in the market. It also found that a total of 52 distributors in various districts had exceeded the negotiated price. Chief Ji of the Bureau brought the list of these distributors who violated the negotiated price to the Municipal Government at 5 pm to ask the Mayor what to do. Afterwards, Mayor Wu told reporters that, according to the rice merchants, the white japonica rice was mostly purchased at high black market prices before the Siamese rice was sold, so the situation was understandable. However, they have been given a final warning. From today onwards, if any further instances of exceeding the negotiated price are found, they will be severely dealt with.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the total rice arrival in the north and south markets was over 540 shi. The Bureau of Social Affairs continued to allocate Siamese rice as usual, but the stores were sluggish. White yuan and silver yuan fell back by 2-3,000 yuan. Japonica rice outside the market also fell by 4-5,000 yuan. The Xian rice supply remained small. Sentiment in the flour market was sluggish, with a slight softening. Wheat bran was scarce and still strong, rising another 5-600 to 1,000 yuan. The oil market also softened, with raw oil falling back by a small 2-3,000 yuan. Soybean oil continued to fall. Rapeseed oil and clear oil from factories had a constant supply source, and the situation was obviously weak. Soybean cake was extremely scarce, with very few transactions. The market trend was downwards. Due to the allocation of Northeastern soybeans by the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation, soybeans became stagnant and fell back by 1-2,000 yuan. Black soybeans were flat and weak, similar to broad beans. Mung beans lacked vitality, and corn also declined by 1-2,000 yuan. However, sorghum was scarce and still stable. Sesame from Zhejiang was actively sought after, and the price rose by 3-4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were strong, but secondary grades were reduced.</p>
<h3>Hua Nan Gang Collects Spot Goods, Yarn Market Reaches New High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market's upward trend continued. Due to rising prices in Guangdong, heavy-weight Double Horse spot goods reached a new high of 3.45 million yuan under the collection of Hua Nan Gang. Ordinary combed yarn also rose by 10,000 yuan. 16-count yarn was particularly popular, with spot goods extremely scarce, and prices exceeding 20-count yarn. 42-count double-strand thread was eagerly snapped up by cotton weaving and cloth factories, rising sharply by 400,000 yuan. Market sentiment was strong, and the trend remained upward.</p>
<p>A Cotton Textile Magnate Discusses Reasons for Yarn Price Increase</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to a leader in the cotton textile industry, the recent surge in cotton yarn prices can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) The aftermath of the issuance of new Customs Gold Unit banknotes has not subsided. (2) Yarn prices are rising in various regions, particularly in Hong Kong. According to a telegram from Hong Kong yesterday, the market price of 20-count special Double Horse yarn in that area has reached 5.6 million yuan. Although the cotton yarn originally shipped to Hong Kong from Japan is allocated at negotiated prices, Hong Kong has recently opened up exports of cotton textiles. Demand in Southeast Asia is strong, so cotton textile exports are booming, and cotton yarn in Hong Kong has become in short supply. Therefore, they are turning to Guangzhou and other places to collect, and cotton yarn prices in various parts of South China have generally risen again.</p>
<h3>Gray Fabric Soars, Printed Fabric Is Strong</h3>
<p>The cloth market has become increasingly frenzied since the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs' Cotton Fabric Price Review Committee adjusted prices. Yesterday, gray fabric was in extremely tight supply, mainly due to the dyeing and weaving factories' extensive purchases. Printed fabrics were also in strong demand due to brisk actual sales in local shops. All parties are trying to replenish stock. Throughout the day, the price increases varied significantly. Furthermore, the major yarn mills have greatly reduced the amount of gray fabric they release. Today, Fangjian Company listed only two types of Grade 2 products, Yanghe and Longtou, at a price of 118,000 yuan, but this ultimately failed to meet everyone's expectations.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on the Southern Transportation of Yarn and Cloth, Executive Yuan Orders Temporary Suspension of Change</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the controlled export of yarn and cloth to South China, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, arguing that yarn and cloth have already resumed free trading, sent a letter to the Textile Control Committee requesting the cancellation of the Southern transportation restrictions. The Textile Control Committee reported the situation to the Executive Yuan for instructions. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan's instructions have arrived in Shanghai, ordering a temporary suspension of the change. Therefore, the association will continue to handle the Southern transportation of yarn and cloth this month as usual and will notify manufacturers to report their shipments after the routine meeting this Thursday.</p>
<h3>Serge Sales Are Booming in Beijing</h3>
<p>American navy blue serge, priced at over 60,000 yuan per yard, has been selling very well recently. Merchants from Nanjing have been placing orders, and 7-800 yards have been transported through Jianhua Transport Company. It is said that the price of thin plain serge is too high, and general customers have switched to this material. Tailors in this street are aware of this, so they have also mutually distributed and purchased, resulting in a sudden surge in sales among industry peers. Other transactions have also been significantly boosted.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Uptrend Unabated</h3>
<p>Bituminous Coal Reaches New Price</p>
<p>The supply of various grades of bituminous coal in the coal market is scarce, while demand is urgent. Sellers are raising prices sharply, and transaction prices are extremely chaotic. Although there are rumors in the market that the allocation of coal will be approved soon, the long-distance water cannot quench the immediate thirst, and the market situation is becoming increasingly tight. Although the price of white coal is slightly stable, the trend is also very firm. However, due to the impact of flat-priced briquettes, the market situation for firewood and charcoal is relatively stable.</p>

<h3>Third Inter-Port Match in Hong Kong Ends in Another Defeat for the Shanghai Team Against the Hong Kong Armed Forces Team</h3>
<p>Improper Formation Configuration Leads to Unexpected and Disastrous Defeat</p>
<p>[Hong Kong Air Mail] In the third match of the Shanghai Inter-Port Football Team, facing the Hong Kong Army, Navy, and Air Force Joint Team at Causeway Bay, the number of spectators was far less crowded than at the official Inter-Port matches because it was not a holiday. The match began at 4:00 p.m. Because team captain Li Yichen was injured and unable to play, Jia Youliang took over as acting captain. When choosing positions, the Armed Forces team chose to defend the side facing the mountain and sea, with the wind at their backs. Roberts Toff kicked off, and the 90-minute match began. The Armed Forces team's lineup was as predicted. Because the Shanghai team still used Xin Fuzhen as center back, the excellent center back general Song Lingsheng was switched to left midfield, and the right wing was temporarily assigned to the useless Carlo Liequ instead of Han Longhai. Thus, the lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Armed Forces Team</p>
<p>Bao Weilu</p>
<p>Greenie Abraham</p>
<p>Anderson Queman Kanbu Road</p>
<p>Ford Shutge Gao Loto Stichland Hekie</p>
<p>Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Manya Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Han Longpi Xin Fuzhen Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Li Shi Zhu Mengsheng Roberts Toff Carlo Liequ Jia Youliang</p>
<p>A Great Surprise This time, because Sha Quexun Jin Shun and Yan Shixin were with the army, the Shanghai team's strength was fundamentally discounted. In addition, Li Yichen's swollen foot prevented him from playing, naturally affecting the offensive power. If Han Longhai and Luo Shoufu were still used as supporting forwards yesterday, and Song Lingsheng was used as the center back, then the offensive and defensive powers might not have been as ineffective as yesterday. To lose to the Armed Forces team, it should be known that the current members of the Hong Kong Armed Forces team are seen by football fans as not yet reaching the strength of a single team like Sing Tao or South China. Yesterday, the Shanghai team could not win, no wonder everyone said after the game that it was too unexpected.</p>
<p>Li Shi Scores First Yesterday's shooting process was that after the Shanghai team was repeatedly attacked, they suddenly launched a counterattack eight minutes into the game. Song Lingsheng got the ball and wanted to shoot, but he kicked off course, and the ball rolled diagonally to the left, where Li Yao cut in. Roberts Toff also rushed in, just covering between Abraham and Bao Weilu, leaving a gap for Li Yao to recognize and shoot in.</p>
<p>A Scoreless Tie After the restart, the Armed Forces team launched another major counterattack. Twelve minutes into the game, Stichland made a diagonal shot near the goal, and the ball went over people's heads and into the right side of the Shanghai goal. This ball was impossible for Zhang Banglun to resist, and the first half ended in a 1-1 tie.</p>
<p>Another Goal Lost In the second half, both sides had attacks and defenses, and the Armed Forces team did not dominate as much as in the first half. But eight minutes into the game, Hekie suddenly found an opportunity to dribble the ball into the center and straight in. Xin Fuzhen could not catch up, and watched him approach the goal and shoot into the net. The Armed Forces team took the lead 2-1.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick At that time, both sides only had hard-hitting performances, with no beautiful techniques to be seen. Until eight minutes before the end of the game, Xin Fuzhen was flagged by the linesman for a foul in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. The Armed Forces team's left back Greenie stepped forward to take the kick, and it was a bullseye. The Shanghai team lost 1-3 at the end of the game.</p>
<p>Three Corner Kicks What was most noteworthy yesterday was the very few corner kicks. It was calculated that neither side had kicked a corner kick in the first half. In the second half, the Armed Forces team had one corner kick first, and the Shanghai team had two. There were only three corner kicks in the whole game, which shows that neither side's goal was ever very tense.</p>
<h3>Last Night's Basketball League: Hwa Lien Beats All Blacks by a Landslide</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] There were originally three games in the second Basketball League last night. In the second game, the Group A Indian team forfeited to Hwa Yang, so only two games remained. In the first act, the women's group, Qiang Hua easily defeated the Li team. In the final act, Hwa Lien beat All Blacks by a landslide. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Qiang Hua Easily Defeats Li Team In the opening women's group match, Qiang Hua met the Li team. Gu Liqing of the Li team scored first with a free throw, but it was only a fleeting moment. Cao Manli, Cao Manti, and Huang Jun of Qiang Hua formed a three-legged power, and the score rose sharply. Qiang Hua took the lead 10-1 in the first quarter and 14-1 in the first half. After changing sides, the Cao family team became even more rampant. Chen Wenyan of the Li team only scored one point with a free throw, and the third quarter was 32-2. In the final quarter, Chen Wenyan of the Li team made one shot and one free throw to pull back three points. In the end, Qiang Hua won a landslide victory over the Li team with a score of 58-5.</p>
<p>Hwa Lien's Fierce Offense Hwa Lien and All Blacks took the stage for the final battle. Only five All Blacks players arrived before the game, losing momentum first. After the whistle sounded, Bao Songgang scored first with a free throw. Zhang Shaoqiang of the All Blacks scored three points with consecutive throws and free throws. Hwa Lien made a move with all of its team, and intensified its offensive. Chen Xuechong made two free throws, and Lao Bao scored again. Li Zude of All Blacks returned a goal, and Hwa Lien took the lead 10-4. Zhang Liangxiong of Hwa Lien threw again, Xu Jusheng of All Blacks skillfully scored a hollow basket, Hwa Lien called a timeout, took off his velvet coat, and showed a strong determination to win, and the pressure became tighter. Although Ah Zhang of the All Blacks sprinted several times, he was helpless to support the team alone. In the first half, Hwa Lien led 25-14.</p>
<p>All Blacks Was at a Loss After changing sides and exchanging blows, Lu Dazhen of All Blacks rushed to join the battle, replacing Li Zude. However, All Blacks knew they were no match and played somewhat playfully, losing more and more goals. Ah Di of Hwa Lien also came on stage, and Chen Xuechong temporarily retired. Ren Xiangcheng scored twice, and Ah Di added to the glory. At 41-14, All Blacks was at a loss. Zhang Shaoqing came up with an idea and attacked from the flanks, scoring two goals in a row. Chen Xuechong returned to the field again, replacing the lax Lao Bao, and his prestige reached its peak. Li Zhen smoked outside the field, and Kong Guangyi watched the game with a smile, and the victory was certain. In the last four minutes, Hwa Lien scored 60-30, doubling All Blacks' score. In the end, the result was 64-39.</p>

<h3>On the Qing-Ji Express Train</h3>
<p>— Jinan, 24th, Air Mail from Our Special Correspondent Li Tian</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway Fully Operational (4)</p>
<p>Returning from Qingdao to Jinan, the reporter took the Qing-Ji direct express train that was newly added starting from the 6th of this month. This express train runs once a day in each direction. At 7:25 a.m. on the 9th, before the train departed, I circled the car and discovered that this express car was remodeled and upgraded. The former third class was upgraded to second class, and the second class was upgraded to first class. The car was upgraded, but the passengers were downgraded. However, in terms of other facilities and hospitality on the car, it is better than the Jinling and Qiantang on both lines.</p>
<p>Because the reporter's stay in Qingdao was too short, I missed the opportunity to visit the Sifang Machine Factory, the second largest machine factory in the country attached to the railway bureau. The only way to make up for it was to ask Zhou Wenqin, director of the General Affairs Office of the Railway Bureau, to introduce Pan Shining, director of the Machinery Department of the bureau, who was on the same train, to explain the general situation of the factory to the reporter after the train departed.</p>

<p>According to Director Pan, among the machine factories in the country that can manufacture their own locomotives (i.e., train heads), in addition to the Panyang Locomotive Manufacturing Plant, there is also the Sifang Machine Factory. The factory has a total of 950 machines and 1,800 technical workers, of which 1,300 are originally present and 500 are returning from the rear. During the Japanese management period, manufacturing was once stopped and only repairs were done. After I took over in November of the year before last, because the three repair factories in Puzhen, Jinan, and Tianjin were more than capable of handling the repair work of the Jinpu Railway, and the Sifang Machine Factory originally had manufacturing capabilities, coupled with the fact that the enemy had many steel products left over when they handed it over, I decided to widely collect materials and engage in creation. To date, two locomotives have been manufactured, and the third is scheduled to be completed this month. If we look at the situation of the Panyang Locomotive Manufacturing Plant, which was taken over by the Resources Committee and only manufactures locomotives and does not repair them, only one locomotive has been completed in the past year, then the work efficiency of the Sifang Machine Factory is much higher. Director Pan also said: At the beginning of the takeover, many Japanese technical personnel were employed, but now they have all been replaced by Chinese, which shows that without foreigners, Chinese people can also independently undertake the manufacturing tasks of heavy industry.</p>
<p>This Year's Planned Output Estimate</p>
<p>The factory plans to manufacture nine locomotives, 24 passenger cars, and 240 freight cars this year, which will require approximately 38 billion yuan. According to the factory's existing equipment, if materials and technical personnel are replenished, it can manufacture five locomotives per month for the locomotives alone, or 60 per year. If we calculate based on the current 1,500 locomotives on the national railway, it can replenish one-twenty-fifth of them each year. In recent years, the military cars used on the Jiaoji Jinpu Railway have mostly been repaired by the Western Factory. The fishplates, spikes, etc. used for repairing roads are also produced by Sifang.</p>
<p>Departing Early, Arriving on the Same Day</p>
<p>Director Pan had just finished introducing the Sifang Machine Factory when someone on the train asked why the departure time from Jinan Station was specifically advanced by one hour and twenty-five minutes compared to Qingdao, departing at 6:00 a.m., causing some passengers to miss the train due to the curfew. Director Zhou replied on this point: This is entirely to take into account the safety of passengers, because the Communist army is more active and destroys more roads in the area near Qingdao from Chengyang to Gaomi. Therefore, when setting the time for the express train west from Qingdao, it had to be after dawn at 7:25 a.m. Similarly, in order to pass Chengyang before dark when departing from Jinan, the departure time from Jinan had to be advanced to 6:00 a.m. before dawn. Because the Communist army currently does not dare to openly destroy roads in broad daylight, and mostly does it at night. In order to facilitate passengers, in addition to changing the ability to purchase tickets and reserve seats one day in advance, the railway bureau can only make the passengers in Jinan get up early and work harder! Director Zhou also said: The distance between Qing and Ji is 392 kilometers. Ordinary express trains take two days and about 17 hours (stopping at night). Now, the express train only takes 13 hours and can arrive on the same day, which is naturally much more progressive.</p>
<p>Steel Rails Destroyed, Rushed to Repair That Night</p>
<p>The train arrived at Jiaoxian at 9:29 a.m. and Gaomi at 10:20 a.m., arriving on time as scheduled. However, when the train reached Caijiazhuang, a small station two stations west of Gaomi, which was originally not scheduled to stop, it suddenly stopped and stopped for a particularly long time. At first, I didn't understand, but then I saw some passengers had gotten off the train, so I followed them. At this station, which was so badly damaged that it was impossible to find a complete house, the stationmaster was telling the reason for the train's stop. It turned out that between Talbao, Zhangling, and Taibaozhuang in front of them, more than a thousand Communist troops had blown up five sections of the common rail and a total of 49 rails after 11:00 p.m. last night. In addition, a ten-meter steel bridge was also blown up. By the time the road protection army and police heard the explosion and rushed to encircle and suppress them, the Communist troops had fled to Shuangyangdian south of the railway! The railway bureau sent an engineering train to rush to repair the damaged steel rails that night and completed the work. Now, because the steel bridge has not yet been completed, we have to wait a little longer.</p>
<p>Communist Army Dreams of Overturning the Express Train</p>
<p>The stationmaster also said: The Communist army's original intention was to overturn this special express train, but his attempt was obviously a failure!</p>
<p>The bridge was not completed until 11:20 a.m., and the Communist army made us stay on the train for 32 minutes longer. When the train passed through the damaged area, I also saw many of the blown-up steel rails and steel bridges, broken and discarded by the roadside. Some of the destroyed telegraph pole porcelain bottles still occasionally emitted scattered flashes under the sunlight.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau's Difficulties, Expenses Exceed Income</p>
<p>At 2:10 p.m., the train passed Weixian. According to statistics, fewer incidents occur west of here, and everyone's mood was not as tense as in the morning. During this period, the person in charge of the railway bureau also told me: The current actual difficulties of the railway bureau are (1) Expenses exceed income: If the Jiaoji Line is to be fully restored to its pre-war state, it will still require at least 25 billion. Where will this money come from? Even in terms of the current income and expenditure situation, it is necessary to overdraw about 3 billion each month. (2) Material difficulties: Whether it is sleepers, steel rails, locomotives, or even telecommunications equipment, nothing is lacking. It is useless to talk about having no money, and even if you have money, it is not easy to buy. There are currently 350 passenger cars and more than 2,000 freight cars on this road, which are barely available for use at present, but if the Jinpu Road is repaired, it will become a big problem.</p>
<p>Extreme Lack of Railway Talent</p>
<p>(3) Lack of talent: Most of the railway's needs are for specialized technical talent. Those trained during the enemy and puppet era only know one thing. Especially, there is a shortage of middle and lower-level cadres. Jiao Tong University's graduates are also inadequate. It is hoped that various universities can set up more railway management departments or railway management specialized courses. (4) The fundamental and biggest difficulty is the endless destruction of roads by the Communist army. "Destruction is easy, construction is difficult." It is hoped that the Communist army will show some conscience and everyone will focus on the national economy and people's livelihood. Repairing damaged roads is actually more difficult than building new roads.</p>
<p>Smooth Transportation in All Directions, Humorous Couplet</p>
<p>The train finally arrived safely at Jinan Station at 8:40 p.m. When the reporter stepped out of the station, I saw that the pine and cypress archway built by the railway bureau to celebrate the New Year had not yet been dismantled. Some of the first-time passengers from Qingdao were reciting this humorous couplet on the archway:</p>
<p>Air transport and land travel, smooth transportation in all directions;</p>
<p>Spring returns with good scenery, all things are rejuvenated.</p>
<h3>New Trends in Industry and Commerce: Various Countries Promote Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wang Yizhi, Radio Dispatch from Leiden, 26th</p>
<p>The latest economic policy of Russia is to promote the production of Consumers' Goods for daily use. Daily use consumer goods refer to clothing, food, utensils, and other necessities for the people. It is estimated that the Russian industrial manufacturing capacity in 1947-20 can produce 500,000 beds, 4,000 tons (i.e., 4 million kilograms) of kitchen utensils, woodenware valued at 250 trillion chablis, 5 million pairs of ski shoes, 23 million pairs of socks for men and women, and 13.5 million pairs of leather shoes. Based on a total Russian population of 150 trillion, on average, only one out of every ten people can get new leather shoes, and only 13 million knitted wool and cotton shirts, which seems that only one garment can be distributed for every ten people. It is said that Russia will not be able to complete large-scale state-owned footwear and socks industries until 1950. At that time, it is expected that 240 trillion pairs of shoes and 580 trillion pairs of socks for men and women can be created for distribution across the country, which will finally be sufficient. The current fourth "Five-Year Plan," starting in 1946 and continuing to 1950, is particularly focused on expanding the food and daily necessities industries. However, their development cannot proceed as rapidly as the steel and chemical industries. It is feared that even by 1950, the pre-war state will not be restored, as the Russian territory is now much larger than it was in 1940, and the population has also increased dramatically. According to the planned pace of the fourth Five-Year Plan, the breeding of livestock, and the harvests of wheat, cotton, flax, and other agricultural products must achieve numbers in 1950 that exceed the original production volume of 1940 by a certain percentage. Without raw materials, more production will be difficult. This depends half on human effort and half on nature. Whether it will be fulfilled as desired by then is something that cannot be predicted today.</p>

<p>Reviving Industry, Eliminating Panic</p>
<p>The manufactured goods independently produced by industrial nations are indeed inexpensive. However, if we observe this from another perspective, we see that when people are busy with industry, they often fail to give equal attention to agriculture. In countries where industrial products are cheap, the prices of agricultural products become more expensive. Or, if their domestic agricultural production is insufficient and they have to rely on imports from overseas, then, in this Pacific era, a populous nation like China, even if labor costs are lower than in other countries, may still need to purchase grains, which are fundamental to the people's diet, from other countries. If other countries discover this weakness, and the source is cut off, the country will suffer famine. In wartime, overseas transportation can be suddenly interrupted. People can still survive without essential industrial products, but agricultural products are indispensable. No matter how desolate or chaotic the world may be, rural households can easily be self-sufficient. In China, rice and cloth already represent a fulfillment of both hunger and warmth. However, laborers in large cities struggle to survive, suffering the pain of hunger and starvation. Prioritizing agriculture is the first task of all, and sufficient food is the key to stabilizing the people. China is as vast and populous as Russia. If the people speak of industry, promoting the manufacture of "daily consumer goods" is most beneficial. These goods are the foundation of the country, always needing replenishment, and having a daily market, making it least likely to cause unemployment panic. Other things, such as indispensable luxury goods for beauty, sports equipment that makes people feel younger, and ingeniously designed and novel inventions, can all cater to the demands of human nature and be exchanged with friendly nations for our indispensable commercial rights. If these things are entirely made by foreigners, for example, a radio receiver that is essential in modern families, or a vacuum cleaner that can both sweep and dust, once purchased, there is no need to replace it for five or ten years or more. If these items were all made domestically, then, as mentioned above, new inventions, luxury goods, or sports equipment, which do not need to be replenished frequently and do not have a daily market, are most likely to cause public panic due to overproduction.</p>
<p>Fine Craftsmanship and Arts: Catching Up Quickly</p>
<p>Our country's industrial knowledge is still nascent, so why take such a great risk? I believe that the Chinese people value loyalty, bravery, and peace. Among the European countries, we are somewhat similar to Switzerland, which is free from worldly strife. The Chinese are skilled in fine craftsmanship and arts, such as carving, embroidery, porcelain, lacquerware, and trinkets, which is very similar to the Swiss who love to make watches and wood carvings during their agricultural leisure time. In the past, unscrupulous Japanese merchants, recognizing the psychology of European and American countries welcoming Chinese goods, used counterfeits to deceive and profit, which is hateful and regrettable. Now, inferior goods bearing the name "Made in China" are fortunately disappearing in European and American cities. Our country can always maintain its undefeated position in fine craftsmanship and arts. Since fine craftsmanship and arts do not conflict with the new inventions and innovations of machine manufacturing in friendly European and American nations, we should seize this moment and move forward, while making overseas merchants related to this fine craftsmanship and arts the bridge to expand the sales of domestic goods. This is a small hope for our Chinese team to negotiate commercial treaties and exchange equal rights with small countries, simple and easy to implement.</p>
<p>Stabilizing the People: Emphasizing Agriculture and Ensuring Food Sufficiency</p>
<p>Those with particularly large investments in Westernization, such as coffee in Brazil, sugar in Cuba, and rubber in Singapore, are not without great benefits that are pleasing for a time, but they are all mono-agriculture. When faced with sudden competition from other countries' agricultural products, it is very easy to lead to tragedies such as unemployment and famine. Our country is vast and rich in resources, superior to Russia, and very similar to France in Europe and the United States in America, with broad paths for survival, so we should not be misled by greed. Gu Tinglin said, "When the world is in chaos, the people gather in cities; when the world is at peace, the people disperse in the fields. Sufficient food is the key to stabilizing the people, and prioritizing agriculture is the first task of all." If the people have available funds and plan to seek machinery from overseas, they should first acquire those sufficient to expand agriculture and water conservancy for beneficial use. Then, they should acquire and use those that can increase agricultural production and promote the daily consumer goods industry. Proceeding in this way will both strengthen the country and benefit the people's livelihood. For those who extravagantly advocate establishing new industries without selection or planning, straying from the path, blindly following trends without considering their capabilities, there should be at least ten times more certainty to guarantee success.</p>

<h3>Key US Government Officials Resigning, Creating Serious Problems</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi from the American magazine "Newsweek"</p>
<p>Recently, quite a few key US government officials have requested resignations one after another: Baruch and his capable colleagues have resigned as Chairman and members of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission; Mayhew and Smith have resigned as President and Vice President of the International Bank; Vinant has resigned as the US representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council; Bernays has resigned from his position as Secretary of State, and Acheson is about to resign as Undersecretary of State; Admiral Leahy is about to resign as Chief of Staff to the US President.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, the US government has lost several exceptionally talented individuals such as Wyeth and Puder, and even more experienced young people were lost throughout the past year.</p>
<p>The departure of this large group of individuals has greatly weakened the efficiency of public service. Narrow-minded Republicans not only do not feel worried about this but instead believe: (1) that some people are resigning because they distrust Truman's prospects; (2) that the degradation of the government's administrative departments will make the prospects of the Republican Party in 1948 even more optimistic.</p>
<p>Acheson</p>
<p>However, when a first-rate person steps down, especially when a replacement with comparable ability cannot be found, it is ultimately a loss for the entire country. If a large number of first-rate people resign their positions at the same time, the loss is even greater. The consequences are low national administrative efficiency, and the entire government or certain departments may disintegrate as a result. The country is in danger of regressing.</p>
<p>The large number of government officials resigning from international public service indeed creates a very serious problem. Among them are also several older statesmen, whose appointments to key positions were originally temporary; Baruch, Mayhew, and Leahy all belong to this category of people. After their departure, it is not easy to find suitable successors. President Truman has not yet invited responsible individuals to serve as President of the International Bank.</p>
<p>Baruch</p>
<p>The imminent resignation of Acting Secretary of State Acheson will be another major loss for the US government. He has consistently acted as Secretary of State during Secretary of State Bernays' attendance at international conferences. Although his power was limited and his staff was insufficient, Acheson made every effort to keep the Secretary of State unified and maintain America's consistent policies.</p>
<p>President Truman often laments that he cannot recruit first-rate people, and at the same time, he does not seem to be able to make every effort to retain the excellent people he has already obtained. Wyeth is an example. He is an individual with great intelligence and energy, and his resignation is indeed a great loss to the public.</p>
<p>Among the many reasons for resignation, there is at least one factor that the US Congress can and should correct: the meager salaries. Although US government salaries were raised last year, they are still very low compared to the salaries of leaders in the business world. Most first-rate government officials, unless they possess private property, generally find it difficult to sustain themselves in public service.</p>
<h3>Sweden Today: Wavering Between the US and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— (Translated by Xishui from the American magazine "Life")</p>
<p>Sweden can be considered one of the most Americanized countries in the world. Although this is not a new development, the tendency of Sweden to become Americanized is increasing, especially after the end of the war, when Sweden must rely heavily on imports of American goods. Thirty percent of Sweden's total imports come from the United States. American cars can be seen everywhere in Sweden, mostly 1946 models, and some 1947 models.</p>
<p>From Gothenburg to small towns and villages, every main street in Switzerland can be called an American street. The stores in the capital, Stockholm, are filled with American goods, some of which are not easy to buy in the United States. There you can find American soap, safety razors and blades, canned food, groceries, gummy candies, radios, light bulbs, and daily necessities such as lighters, sunglasses, and fountain pens. Some of these goods must be purchased with ration coupons, such as a bar of soap. Moreover, prices are often so high that people dare not ask. A pack of ordinary American cigarettes costs two kronor, about 70 cents in US dollars. An American radio costs twice the market price in the United States, and an American fountain pen costs more than twice as much.</p>
<p>On the surface, Sweden seems Americanized, and public opinion is extremely pro-American, but the Swedish government is leading the country to follow the political line of the Soviet Union. The Swedish government recently concluded a trade and credit agreement with the Soviet Union, with Sweden granting the Soviet Union a 1 billion kronor credit loan specifically for the purchase of Swedish goods. The Swedish public generally believes that this is a serious turning point in Swedish foreign policy. Government spokesmen have repeatedly said: Why shouldn't Sweden, which has now lost the German market, trade with the Soviet Union as it does with Western democracies? However, the Swedish people eagerly want to know: Why should Sweden, as a small country, lend the Soviet Union a huge loan of 1 billion kronor? Compared with the national wealth, this is an unbearable figure. The United States has already lent its wartime ally, Britain, about 4 billion. But the Swedes say: The Soviet Union is not Sweden's ally. In Stockholm's park, opposite the Royal Palace, stands the statue of King Charles XII, Sweden's Napoleon, who fought against the Russians in the early eighteenth century. One hand rests on his sword hilt, the other is raised high. The Swedes will tell you that his hand is pointing towards Moscow.</p>
<p>The consequences of the Swedish-Soviet trade agreement are not difficult to predict. Soviet merchants or government representatives will come into contact with Swedish industrialists. Swedish industry must be expanded in order to fully fulfill the terms of the agreement. Soviet representatives are already preparing to move into Stockholm; the Soviet ambassador has already occupied the magnificent former Japanese embassy. The current Prime Minister Erlander was originally the Minister of Education and did not aspire to his current position, but now that he has assumed this position, he is determined to take his responsibility seriously with the attitude of a university professor. Of course, he cannot overturn the policies he has inherited, but I believe he will do his best to restore Sweden to the "middle way."</p>

<h3>The Torment of British Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, British diplomacy has shown an active posture. On the one hand, the Anglo-French alliance, after the visit of former French Prime Minister Blum to Britain, has been materialized, and the alliance treaty will soon be signed and established. On the other hand, Anglo-Soviet relations have shown great improvement after the visit of British Chief of Staff Montgomery to Moscow. Swiss newspapers have even widely reported that Britain and the Soviet Union have established a secret agreement to divide their spheres of influence in Europe and the Near East. On the surface, British diplomacy seems very smooth and has achieved considerable success. However, in reality, the torment of British diplomats is deepening day by day.</p>
<p>Regarding the Anglo-French alliance, there is no problem in Britain and France, but what is the attitude of the Soviet Union? This is of great importance. From the perspective of Britain and France, the Anglo-French alliance can supplement the deficiencies of the Anglo-Soviet treaty and the Franco-Soviet treaty and promote the Anglo-French-Soviet triangular relationship, similar to the Anglo-French Entente before World War I. The Soviet Union should not express any objections. However, according to recent statements by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has not been able to completely eliminate its suspicion of the Anglo-French alliance intention. How will Britain obtain the Soviet Union's understanding? This still requires continued efforts from the British diplomatic authorities.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding Anglo-Soviet relations, although Britain has the sincerity to gain the Soviet Union's goodwill, is the Soviet Union truly willing to maintain a close relationship with Britain? At least for now, this is still a serious question. For example, the Soviet radio station broadcast a TASS news report on the 28th of last month, openly accusing the British policy towards the Soviet Union of running counter to the spirit of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. At the same time, Soviet newspapers launched a large-scale attack on the British military presence in Abyssinia, and a concrete relationship still cannot be established. Moreover, we also feel that although British diplomacy is experienced and shrewd, it is ultimately inferior to the sophisticated maneuvering of Soviet diplomats.</p>
<p>In the past month, we have seen very clearly that the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain has indeed changed. It is not like in the past, where it made things difficult for Britain everywhere, specifically seizing on the Greek issue, the Iranian issue, and the Spanish issue to attack British foreign policy as endangering world peace. However, it is questionable whether the change in the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain has other purposes. In the past month, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the United States has remained the same. Moreover, the Soviet propaganda offensive has targeted the United States everywhere, either attacking the United States for adopting atomic diplomacy or scolding the United States for attempting to monopolize atomic energy. Here, we can see a subtle effect. The Soviet Union has clearly adopted a divisive policy towards Britain and the United States. In weighing the balance, the Soviet Union's treatment of the United States and Britain already has a tendency to differentiate between intimacy and distance. Recalling before the outbreak of World War II, wasn't Nazi Germany's foreign policy pro-British and anti-French? Wasn't Japan's policy towards Britain and the United States pro-American and anti-British? Therefore, what is the Soviet Union's true intention? Britain still cannot grasp it!</p>
<p>In addition, the most troublesome issue for Britain after the war, the Palestinian problem, after two years of turmoil, bloodshed, and terror, the Holy Land has now become a dark hell. The seriousness of the situation is increasing, forcing the British government to order British women and children to evacuate back home. At the same time, the round table conference on the Palestinian issue held in London not only has no hope of solving the Palestinian problem, but the leaders of the Zionist movement have consistently refused to participate in the meeting. It is expected that the future result will be that the London round table conference will repeat the failure of last September and will again end in failure, forcing Britain to refer this issue to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>In short, it is the torment of the British diplomatic authorities, and it is also the troubles of the post-war world.</p>
<h3>Soviet Censorship: Always Present in History, More Intense Today</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zuo from American Newsweek</p>
<p>As early as 1885, an American writer named George Kennan, after traveling from Siberia, wrote a monumental book entitled "Siberia and the Exile System." In the book, he did not mention the names of many people who provided him with information, specifically stating his difficulties in the preface: "I dare not even mention the names of these many people. Although their character and contributions are worthy of remembrance and respect, they unfortunately grew up in Russia, where the government regards frank opinions as unreliable things and regards innovative efforts as a crime."</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled to the Soviet Union knows that the basic characteristics described in these kinds of ancient books have not changed to this day. The Soviet Union's strict attitude towards censorship has never changed. They closely monitor foreign journalists and cut off sources of information, making it extremely difficult to gather news. The official's rude attitude towards foreign journalists has caused the United States to have an unpleasant impression of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Why do these situations exist in the Soviet Union? My explanation is as follows: First, the Soviet Union's attitude towards censorship is merely an extreme manifestation of the general attitude held by European countries. Outside of Britain and the United States, the idea that the government has the right and responsibility to control the thoughts of the people is almost a universal tradition. In this regard, the Soviet Communist revolution does not count as a revolution. The predecessors who nurtured the spirit of the Soviet revolution, such as Feuerbach, Herzen, Bakunin, Belinsky, and even Lenin and Stalin, led nothing more than revolutions of the intellectual class. In their conception, the so-called "people" are nothing more than a mob being dominated and led. Even if we include Marx and Engels among the revolutionary martyrs, it cannot change this basic typical Soviet thought in the slightest.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's suspicion of foreigners is nothing more than a tendency to keep secrets. After reading history and travelogues, one cannot conclude whether this suspicion is stronger under the Soviet government than in the Tsarist era. The George Kennan mentioned above, if he had not given a speech in the American Geographical Society in New York beforehand, supporting Russia's treatment of political prisoners, the Russian authorities would never have allowed him to travel freely in the Siberian exile lands.</p>
<p>If you think that this suspicion is limited to Moscow, you are mistaken. Originally, this is a universal phenomenon. Travelers, even if they carry Moscow passports, will still be suspected by local officials everywhere.</p>
<p>This attitude was by no means created by Stalin; it was already nurtured in the character of the Russian people in past generations. Therefore, although we advise the Soviet authorities to change this attitude, the result only increases their suspicion of us.</p>

<h3>Dardanelles</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>After World War II, Turkey's million-strong defense forces have not yet been demobilized and have even intensified their alert at various strategic locations. The reasons for this include the internal instability and frequent armed conflicts in neighboring countries (such as Greece and Iran), which Turkey fears will be affected, as well as the strong neighbor's coveting of the Dardanelles, which Turkey considers its lifeline, as the biggest factor.</p>
<p>The Dardanelles Strait, belonging to Turkey, is the only passage for countries on the Black Sea to reach the Mediterranean Sea, and has always been valued internationally. During World War I, Turkey joined the Central Powers and failed. The Allied Powers then signed the Treaty of Lausanne with Turkey, stipulating that no fortresses or troops could be stationed on both sides of the strait. Later, Turkey requested the abolition of this unequal treaty. In 1936, it signed a convention in Montreux, Switzerland, with Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Japan, Greece, South, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries, abolishing some restrictions, but stipulating that Turkey must not block the Dardanelles. Turkey has adhered to this agreement to this day. Since last year, the Soviet Union has repeatedly presented notes to Turkey, demanding that the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly manage the strait. This move by the Soviet Union seems to want to abandon the Montreux Convention, which the countries concerned should oppose, because the Soviet Union overemphasizes its own security and sovereignty and infringes on the security and sovereignty of other countries.</p>
<p>After World War II, the relationship between the three major powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, has never been fully coordinated. The new status of the Dardanelles is unpredictable. Britain has proposed convening a meeting of the countries that signed the Montreux Convention, replacing Japan with the United States, to discuss the future of the strait. The Soviet Union's policy has recently been changing, becoming slightly more moderate than before, but it is difficult to say whether it is willing to compromise on the issue of the strait.</p>

<h3>Tolstoy's Later Years</h3>
<p>— Ke Tong</p>
<p>It is well known that the Russian literary giant Tolstoy has achieved brilliant accomplishments and immortal value in the world literary scene. In his later years, his thinking underwent a great transformation. This transformation had already shown signs before "Anna Karenina" was finished. By 1877, when the book was published, or at the turn of the 1870s and 1880s, he began to feel an internal change, pursuing a life that was more sincere and had more spiritual value than reality. He persisted in this intention until his death. As a result, the many years of happy love and affection between him and his wife came to an end.</p>
<p>In the early stage of Tolstoy's ideological transformation, he vehemently explored the doctrines of Orthodox Christianity, hoping to find a way out of his thoughts within the church. He believed that religion was what the general public believed in. He might be able to better understand the people from this. However, his exploration ended in disappointment, and he gradually abandoned Orthodox Christianity. During this period, he became increasingly estranged from his family, and it could be said that he rarely cared about his children. Occasional impulses would make him disgusted with his wife. In addition, he suffered five bereavements within four years. His dissatisfaction with life and his pursuit of truth became increasingly intense. Reading his "Confessions" or other works, we know that his pursuit did not yield satisfactory results, and he sometimes had thoughts of leaving home and committing suicide. He pursued faith in God, so he sometimes went to talk with Count Bobrinsky about the teachings of the British missionary Radstock, sometimes visited his close friend S.S. Urusov to discuss the beliefs of the Orthodox Church, sometimes questioned itinerant believers, and sometimes sought advice from priests and clergymen. However, no person and no principle could satisfy his wishes and restore him to tranquility! As his own spirit declined and withered, an extreme resistance arose against the existing religion, the progress of civilization, science, the family, and the accumulation of hundreds of years of human evolution. What he saw in his heart seemed to belong to the evil and hardship, and all the joyful and lovely things disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Although Tolstoy stood in opposition to Orthodox Christianity and the church, he acknowledged that Jesus' teachings were valuable sacred words. He believed that the former contradicted the latter. Tolstoy most opposed the pointless rituals of religion. He strived to apply the Gospel to practical life. In Chapter 4 of "My Religion," "Misunderstanding of Christ's Teachings," he said: "Generally speaking, people have various different interpretations of Christ's teachings, but the direct and simple meaning naturally revealed in the words is ignored. He followed Christ's teachings and applied them to practical life. Tolstoy's teachings paid most attention to individual liberation, hoping to dismantle the entire evil society through individual repentance. In Chapter 3 of "My Religion," "God's Laws and Human Laws," he said: "Christ's laws always move and please me. However, in every aspect, historical traditions and my current environment, my own life, another kind of law governs us. Although this cannot be reconciled with my conscience and intellect, it is compatible with my bestiality. I feel that if I accept Christ's laws, I will be different from the general public, and I will be harmed and criticized as Christ predicted. But if I accept human laws, I can be approved by everyone and get a peaceful and stable life. Various theological subtleties can be cited by me to earn the comfort of my conscience, and as Christ said, I can laugh and be happy. I recognize this situation, so I dare not pursue what God's laws are. I only distort them and continue my bestial life."</p>
<p>In 1884, Tolstoy once wanted to elope with a field worker, a peasant woman, and go to open up a new life with the farmers, but in the end it did not happen. Another time, Tolstoy had a disagreement with his wife over horses. He checked some personal belongings, wrapped them in a package, and left home, claiming that he was going to America and would never come back. At four o'clock the next morning, he finally couldn't bear it and went home. In 1897, Tolstoy again decided to leave. No one knew his secret, and he wrote a letter to his wife, but in the end that plan was not realized either. From this, it can be seen that the change in his thinking in his later years had drawn an irreparable chasm between him and his family, until his death. A great soul goes to pursue the truth, and his heart is more eager than love.</p>
<p>In 1891 and the following two years, Tolstoy participated in the work of helping disaster victims. At first he was satisfied, but later he still thought it was not enough, and he wanted to move towards a more self-sacrificing behavior. In 1895, his youngest son, Vanechka, passed away. This was a great blow to Tolstoy. After that, the last link between him and his family broke, sowing the distant cause of his departure in 1897 (this time, as mentioned above, he did not really leave). After Vanechka's death, the children who had slowly grown up got married one by one and left. The family seemed extraordinarily quiet and indifferent, and Tolstoy's health also deteriorated. In September 1901, he moved to Crimea in the south on doctor's orders, where he lived for ten months. His health did not improve at all, but worsened. After that, he left the world, probably to find the truth in another world.</p>
<h3>Clouds</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhao</p>
<p>Clouds, the heaven where poets exile their emotions, farmers see as a joyful sign of spring budding; an old helmsman at sea, occasionally seeing a cloud coming from the ocean, will think that there should be a wind, an east wind, a south wind, or a northwest wind.</p>
<p>I love clouds, I love them like surging waves, coming with the force of a thousand pounds toppling mountains and overturning seas, how majestic this spirit is. I love clouds, I love their beautiful and ingenious shapes, evoking my reverie. I love clouds, whether it is a clear blue sky dotted with white clouds, or a colorful and bright cloud at sunset.</p>
<p>The symbol of clouds is refreshing, illusory, and also liberating. Look carefully, think carefully, it can represent life, life is like a cloud.</p>
<p>The personality of clouds is innocent, pure, without hypocrisy and pretension. When it is angry, it pulls down its gloomy and stereotyped face; when it is happy, it will stretch its legs, swing its waist, head resting on Nanshan Mountain, and feet resting on Beigu Valley. It will also dance lion dances, play dragon lanterns, and when it is happy, it will do a conga dance.</p>
<p>The sky is the home of clouds, and clouds are the master of the sky. Without clouds, the sky would have no changes, no wind, rain, lightning, only a supreme and dictatorial sun. However, all things will wither because of it, and there will be no philosophers, poets, immortal epics, or tragic and tearful legends in the world. Although the universe will not lose its color, it has lost its soul. Clouds are great, clouds are gods who bestow enjoyment on mankind.</p>
<p>The frustrated can get comfort; the optimistic can express their aspirations; the elderly can enjoy themselves when they look at the clouds, and the middle-aged can have a detached view of life when they look at the clouds. Children look at the clouds, clap their little hands, stomp their feet, and shout and sing, "Uncle Cloud, where is your Lightning Goddess?"</p>
<p>Clouds sometimes show their amorous feelings, sometimes appreciate their own beauty, sometimes weep in the deep night, and sometimes climb high and whistle. Like young girls, lonely widows, hermits, and giant beasts, all are shaped in the changes of the wind and clouds.</p>
<p>And I love clouds because clouds are like my mother. As if giving warmth.</p>
<h3>Talking About Poetry</h3>
<p>— Hu Ne</p>
<p>Poetry is not made up of beautiful words and phrases, and the quality of a poem cannot be determined by its external beauty; a good poem is not about the beauty of words, but about the richness and fulfillment of its content, and most importantly, poetry cannot be separated from reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, poetry is not the cry of a poet's heart, but the resonance of the lives of the masses!</p>
<p>Poets are the prophets of the masses, the bright lamps of glory, able to awaken the sleeping world and illuminate the opaque reality.</p>
<p>Poetry is not a pastime for refined people, poetry is a mirror of reality.</p>
<p>Poetry is the source of life, poetry can bring courage to people.</p>
<h3>Cold Scholar——Continuation of the Yangzhou Dream, Part Eight!</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>In Yangzhou, when residents have weddings, funerals, or celebrations, many beggars come to ask for alms, which is the same as in other places. Among these beggars, the cold scholar occupies a special position, which is not found everywhere. These cold scholars are not as numerous as other people who call themselves "masters" or "madams." In terms of qualifications, they are mostly intellectuals. Furthermore, in terms of clothing, even though their shoes and hats are incomplete and their hair is very long, they still wear a long gown. Wearing a gown seems to have invisibly become a unique symbol of the cold scholar. As for being mostly intellectuals, it just shows that they were not originally lowly people, but because of their improper behavior, they have fallen to this state. Therefore, their number is naturally not large.</p>
<p>Among them, there seems to be an invisible organization. They investigate clearly which family has a happy event and which family has a funeral, and they all know each other. Some people say that they collude with the so-called "messengers" who specialize in delivering invitations and the so-called "helpers" who temporarily help out in the neighborhood, which is probably true. When they go to people's homes, they don't go empty-handed, but always bring a small gift. The host will definitely return this gift if they can, and they also have to give a large sum of money as "respect money." Regardless of the amount of this "respect money," they always have to argue for more and dislike less, and they argue even more fiercely for some upstarts and those whose family background is not very clear. If they don't get what they want, they will shout loudly at the door, revealing the secrets that the host doesn't want to publicize, in order to blackmail them. As a result, the accountant or the helper usually comes out to mediate and add a few coins to settle the matter. However, it is always about giving before taking, which is naturally more elegant than begging empty-handed, so the status of the cold scholar is far above that of ordinary beggars.</p>
<p>The family background of the cold scholars used to be very good. Their ancestors or fathers had been officials and made fortunes. In their childhood, who didn't live in luxury? Some had donated officials, wore official hats and peacock feathers, and sat in green sedan chairs. Some had traveled overseas and were proficient in foreign languages. Still others could write poetry and paint, and their speech was elegant. However, they were all addicts, first to opium, then to red pills, and even to white powder, which made them stay in the world of inhaling smoke and exhaling mist all day long. When all their property was turned into opium, red pills, and white powder and consumed by themselves, they shamelessly changed their profession to become cold scholars.</p>
<p>Becoming a cold scholar requires a good family background, so their number will naturally not be very large. Because they used to have a very good family background, they naturally have many relatives and friends who are still doing well. Therefore, they not only go to the homes of people who have weddings, funerals, or celebrations to beg in disguise, but also go in and out of various teahouses to "ask for help" from relatives and friends. "Old in-law! This nephew really can't make it today, please help me!" "Brother! Little brother begs for brother's well-being, please help me today no matter what!" We used to often hear such words in teahouses. The one speaking was the cold scholar, standing on one side of the table. Those "old in-laws" and "brothers" were entangled, and the only result was to spend money. Before the War of Resistance, one could give a beggar only a few copper coins, but one had to give them at least twenty cents. When they complained about the small amount and argued for more, and after a long time of haggling, the old in-laws would shake their heads and sigh, "Alas! He doesn't learn good things, he has lost all the face of his ancestors!" In fact, these cold scholars have no good plans for themselves, let alone thinking about their ancestors! There is only one thing, their words are very elegant, such as "a gentleman is steadfast in poverty" and "wealth and honor are like floating clouds to me"... These are all clichés, used to let others know that they are indeed from a scholarly family. If their ancestors knew, it would be comforting to them!</p>
<p>Wang Bu's "Anecdotes from the Worm Hermitage" says: "During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, a wealthy monk of Tianning Temple passed away. Those who went to pay their respects were generously given gifts, each called 'travel expenses.' A man named Zhong from the local village imitated him. There was a scholar named Qiu, whose physique was like a dwarf. People called him Qiu the Stubborn. He was not acquainted with the deceased, but for the sake of the gift money, he prepared a gift and went to pay his respects, going several times a day. The bereaved family was surprised and asked, 'When the deceased was alive, I never saw you come and go?' Qiu said, 'The dead man knows it in his stomach!' Those who heard it burst into laughter. From then on, people always went to offer congratulations or condolences at weddings and funerals, waiting at the door and sending servants in to urge them, even demanding more money, going back and forth several times, losing all sense of shame, not as good as beggars. After Qiu died, those who inherited his mantle were all descendants of old families, aimless idlers, who still considered themselves gentlemen. This custom remains unchanged to this day. When the common people encounter these people, they call them Qiu the Stubborn. There are also funeral worms in Kunshan who are similar." The Qiu the Stubborn mentioned here seems to be more elegant than the cold scholars, because he still has a servant to follow him. However, it is these not very elegant cold scholars who have died a lot in the last ten years. The quality of those who have succeeded them has gradually declined. It is difficult to talk about family background or knowledge anymore, and there is no longer much distance between them and ordinary beggars.</p>
<h3>After the Snow (Photography)</h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 159</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Vladivostok...Haha...Vladivostok is already in Japan's bag, how could it be considered a Soviet stronghold?"</p>
<p>"Alright, then let's talk about Chita." I urged Tsurumi to continue.</p>
<p>"Since Chita is the last railway stronghold of the Soviet Union, the Japanese regard this stronghold as the forward station for the first secret station against the Soviet Union. And the real active forward station is Harbin, also known as Binjiang."</p>
<p>"How about the arrangements?"</p>
<p>"That's a military operation, a battlefield of great espionage warfare between the two sides; they are all using White Russians."</p>
<p>"This is only one of the eight secret stations, what else?" I was a little afraid of his rambling.</p>
<p>"Hmph...there's another city called Tacheng; I'm afraid you'll be even less inclined to believe it, isn't that right? That's the forward station, the main station is actually Dihua in your esteemed country! The branch station is Suiding."</p>
<p>"Okay, I believe you; what else?"</p>
<p>"This is to deal with the Soviet Union. To deal with the United States, the main station is in Manila, and the forward station is far away in Hilo, Honolulu; for England, there are Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Calcutta; for France or the joint Anglo-French, there are Rangoon and Haiphong. Because we need to make up the number 'eight,' Hong Kong and Haiphong are only counted as one mixed station, with a considerable number of plainclothes and small-line operatives, but only one person in charge."</p>
<p>"Maybe that's the 'one-eight' secret that Pingzi mentioned?" I made a small conclusion to this speculation.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's not that simple."</p>
<p>Just as we were about to continue our research, we suddenly heard two knocks on the door. The doorknob moved, stopped for about a second, and then the door opened. I saw "Zero Four" walking in, holding a coded telegram in his hand:</p>
<p>"Reporting, received at four twelve."</p>
<p>Tsurumi only glanced at the code, and then slammed it on the ground:</p>
<p>"Bastard!" Tsurumi seemed to be losing his temper. I knew that Tsurumi was not willing to be so willful. Although his temperament was not very gentle, he was tolerant and never showed such anger, especially in front of his subordinates. This time, he failed in Tokyo and was entangled by Pingzi in a way that he couldn't get rid of, and he became irritable. His scolding was irrelevant, and "Zero Four" thought that he had said the wrong time and stood there dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to tell "Zero Four" to leave, Tsurumi suddenly burst into laughter, reached out and patted "Zero Four" on the shoulder, "Good friend, it's not your fault, go and listen, I'm afraid there will be another telegram." As he spoke, he sent "Zero Four" out the door and even gave him a bow.</p>
<p>I picked up the telegram and took a look. It was sent from Tokyo, and according to the code, it was simply written:</p>
<p>"Support secretly, pay attention to 'eight,' 'Zero Five One Three One.'"</p>
<p>Tsurumi took the telegram from my hand and looked at it again, so hard that it seemed that the code paper hid some special secret:</p>
<p>"Eight..." Tsurumi read this word again calmly, "Old brother, I think this is not a telegram from headquarters, it must have been sent separately by 'Zero Five.' Maybe it's a message that he overheard from headquarters, and he thinks it's important, so he specially notified us, but why is it so simple?"</p>

<h3>Fingerprints Everywhere, Evidence Complete. Those Who Take Advantage of Disaster Will Not Escape the Law!</h3>
<p>……Talking About "Fingerprints" and Solving Cases……</p>
<p>In the investigation of crimes, fingerprints are considered the most powerful evidence. The recent Westmore Road fire investigation committee has also discovered fingerprints on the chopped wardrobe, which are considered the fairest and most reliable evidence. It is expected that these evildoers will not be able to save their heads! Here is some common knowledge about fingerprints:</p>
<p>Many people think that fingerprints can represent a person's personality, but fingerprint experts are not numerologists. They only want to find evidence of crime in fingerprints. However, experienced fingerprint experts can sometimes guess the person's gender, body shape, and general occupation from fingerprints. But what they are based on is only experience. For example: the thickness of the money strip can determine gender; the folds and scars of the skin can determine age; the size of the entire pattern can determine body shape; as for occupation, the nature of certain jobs can indeed be revealed on fingerprints.</p>
<p>Classification of Fingerprints</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation stores 105 million fingerprint cards, enough to represent 60 million people. And when they receive a fingerprint card, they can determine within 36 hours, even within a few minutes, whether there is an identical one in their files. This seems impossible, but if we know their classification methods, we will not be surprised.</p>
<p>There are only seven types of fingerprints: loop, arch, tented arch, whorl, central pocket loop, double loop, and a shape made up of two or more of the above six types. The most common is the loop, which looks like many hairpins nested together and bent in the same direction (usually towards the little finger). The next most common is the whorl, which is made up of many concentric ellipses, or like a clock spring. There is also the arch, whose lines are raised in the center and separated to both sides.</p>
<p>In this way, the classification work is not difficult to complete. First, divide all the fingerprint cards into several groups according to their similarity, and then divide each group into several subgroups, and so on, until only hundreds of thousands of cards are left in each unit.</p>
<p>But the fingerprints in each unit are not absolutely identical. Because there is only one person in the world who has the same fingerprints as you; and that person is yourself.</p>
<p>So, how do you distinguish similar fingerprints? This requires focusing on small details, but although they are small details, they are extremely important. If eight details match a certain fingerprint, and the relationship between the items is also the same, then the identity verification is considered legally established. These details include: the edge of the finger spring line, irregular circles, dots, branching lines, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, in court, fingerprint experts must prepare at least two enlarged fingerprint photos; one belongs to the victim, and one is obtained from the crime scene. The same details on each sheet are marked with the same numbers next to them. In this way, the law only needs to check whether the details with the same numbers are the same, and can determine whether the defendant is innocent or guilty.</p>
<p>The Great Wisdom of Creation</p>
<p>As for why we effortlessly leave our fingerprints on everything we touch, we have to admire the great wisdom of omnipotent nature.</p>
<p>If you carefully examine an enlarged fingerprint photo (or dip your finger in white powder and then gently wipe it off), you will find many white dots distributed on the lines. These dots are the openings of sweat glands, and the sweat secreted from them is the natural, best printing fluid for the complex rubber stamp on the finger! What is even more wonderful is that these sweat glands accelerate the secretion of sweat when the nerves are tense, making the fingerprints left behind clearer, for example, when committing a crime!</p>
<p>But because sweat is colorless, fingerprints cannot be seen with the naked eye; other substances must be used to display them. Thanks to scientific progress, we have many methods to display and preserve fingerprints.</p>
<p>The most common method is to use powder. In an emergency, almost any fine and clean powder can be used, such as face powder, flour, and cigarette ash. However, to get the best results, you need to use special powder.</p>
<p>Iodine vapor is also often used. When crystalline iodine is heated, it produces purple vapor, and when this gas encounters invisible fingerprints, it displays the fingerprints due to chemical reactions; but the time left is very short and must be immediately captured into the lens.</p>
<p>The camera for taking fingerprints is very similar to an ordinary large camera, with a flat-headed conical lens installed in front of the lens. When taking pictures, stick the flat end of this lens to the object you want to photograph, and then press the aperture. When the aperture is opened, the battery in the lens box automatically lights up at the same time, making the fingerprints particularly clear.</p>
<p>Fingerprints can also be removed as needed. Transparent cellophane tape (also sold in Shanghai) or thin rubber clothing can be used. When using, evenly stick the tape on the fingerprint dipped in powder, and then gently peel off the tape, and the fingerprint will remain on the tape.</p>
<p>The fingerprints obtained from ordinary crime scenes are only a few, but the classification method used by the investigation bureau is based on ten fingers, so the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other institutions sometimes cannot determine the owner of one or several fingerprints, even if he has a file in the bureau, unless he is a major bandit, then the bureau will use another classification method, classifying according to each finger.</p>
<p>Everyone Leaves Fingerprints</p>
<p>So, if you have a suspect and fingerprints, it is easy to determine whether the fingerprints belong to the suspect, but if you only have fingerprints and no suspect, then you cannot find the criminal.</p>
<p>So, someone suggested that everyone in the world should have their fingerprints taken and filed. If this is implemented, it would be much more convenient to defend against crime and espionage. (Excerpted from the October issue of Scientific Digest)</p>
<h3>Lantern Festival (Sheng Zha Zi)</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>Last year on the Lantern Festival,</p>
<p>Victory had just been won;</p>
<p>Returning from demobilization in a hurry,</p>
<p>Cocktails everywhere.</p>
<p>This year on the Lantern Festival,</p>
<p>Index at seventy-nine hundred;</p>
<p>Relief without proper follow-up,</p>
<p>People thinner than fried dough sticks!</p>
<h3>Fire Trees and Silver Flowers Like Last Year, Chaos and War Disturb the Lantern Festival!</h3>
<p>— Xiao Rongshi</p>
<p>The Tang poet said in a poem about the Lantern Festival: "Fire trees and silver flowers meet, the star bridge and iron locks open; dark deer follow horses, bright moon chases people. Courtesans are all lush plums, traveling singers all sing 'Fallen Plum'; the gold crows do not prohibit the night, and the jade drips urge each other"! This poem depicts the grand occasion of the Lantern Festival, with endless beautiful scenery. Looking around the Jiangnan region today, on the Lantern Festival night, the celebrations with lanterns will still be the same as last year, with loud drums and trumpets, filled with an atmosphere different from songs and dances!</p>
<p>But when we look at the "beacon fires," "cannon flowers," and "chaos and war" outside of Jiangnan, smelling the "smell of gunpowder," and seeing groups of refugees drifting everywhere, we feel infinite "heartache"! It is precisely: "Fire trees and silver flowers like last year, chaos and war disturb the Lantern Festival."</p>
<h3>Is the Standing of Eggs Related to the Beginning of Spring?</h3>
<p>— Junzhi</p>
<p>According to reports these past few days: eggs can stand upright at the beginning of spring, and a Chinese scientist in America will publicly demonstrate it, and so on.</p>
<p>At 8:30 PM on the second (definitely not the time of the beginning of spring), I mentioned this matter unintentionally, and I used a friend's words to prove it—he had stood two eggs upright last year at the beginning of spring—and thus. The betting began. Five minutes later, an egg began to stand upright on the table. This aroused my suspicion, but the fact was right before my eyes.</p>
<p>What is going on here? The answer is physics. Everyone should know the physics saying: "An object will not fall down if the vertical line from its center of gravity is within its supporting surface; otherwise, it will fall down." So, the ability of an egg to stand upright is precisely because it meets the above conditions. "Conditions for an object's stability: 1. Low center of gravity; the lower the center of gravity, the more stable the object. 2. Wide supporting surface; the wider the supporting surface, the more stable the object." Therefore, the chance of an egg standing upright is small (only at one point on the large end and one point on the small end) due to the narrow supporting surface; the chance of the large end standing upright is greater than the small end because of the height of the center of gravity. As for the upright standing and the season, I think it is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>You wise readers might as well try it; you will probably not be disappointed! But it doesn't necessarily have to be at the beginning of spring.</p>
<h3>Look at Others, Think of Ourselves: Talking About Travel as Spring Arrives</h3>
<p>— Zhongqi</p>
<p>Talking About the Holiday Travel Life of Americans</p>
<p>In 1947, experts estimate that 60 million Americans will take holiday trips. Americans are willing to spend large sums of money on this kind of luxury travel. This year, tourists will spend approximately 100 billion US dollars on transportation, food, lodging, souvenirs, film, luggage, clothing, and other items. One hundred billion dollars is used to improve the efficiency of various transportation means: railways, airlines, highways, and sea routes are all extremely conveniently connected to various places; vehicles, hotels, parking lots, seaside bathing areas, etc., have all been renovated; everywhere, damaged and outdated equipment has been replaced with the latest.</p>
<p>This year, the majority of travelers will be driving private cars on the highways, making America's highways even more crowded. Cars of all shapes and sizes are lined up in rows on the wide highways, forming a spectacular sight. However, the authorities are very concerned about their safety and have issued warnings: "If you are not confident that your car is safe, leave it at home."</p>
<p>There are also many passengers flying on commercial airlines. New types of aircraft are focusing on speed and capacity. The DC-8 aircraft is produced to meet this need. The interior is luxuriously equipped, and it has a speed of 300 miles per hour, saving passengers time. Some airlines have overnight flights with comfortable seats and berths, complete ventilation equipment, and ample lighting.</p>
<p>Buses solve the travel difficulties of many people. This year, thousands of new buses have been added to the service. The bodies are large and light (aluminum), and their mobility is extremely high. Bus fares are low, so they are very popular, especially among group travelers.</p>
<p>In addition to being slower than airplanes, trains have the advantages of all other modes of transportation, such as low fares, suitability for long-distance travel, and a very low probability of accidents. The equipment in the train is also as luxurious as possible. Sitting in the seat is like being in the living room at home, the bedrooms are comparable to high-end hotels, and the dining service is even better than ordinary restaurants.</p>
<p>It seems impossible for Chinese people to travel by car (including private and public buses) because the road infrastructure is not perfect and safety along the way is lacking. Air travel has become a cause for concern due to recent consecutive accidents. Train travel, sadly, except for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines (which are extremely crowded), the rest have been "looted" to the point of utter destruction.</p>
<p>With the spring sunshine bright and the flames of war everywhere, can the Chinese people even think about travel?</p>
<h3>Philosophical Musings</h3>

<p>You think it's the sun? True, our knowledge only goes that far.</p>
<p>The Moon</p>
<p>He should be ashamed of being praised; what brilliance does he have himself? He boasts of himself by borrowing the light of others, yet people are always willing to be deceived by him.</p>
