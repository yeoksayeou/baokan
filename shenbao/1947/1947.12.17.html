<h3>美國會核准援外案衆院撥款委會削減數額馬歇爾將加速進行援華</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處報盛頓十五日電〕國會十五日業已完成核准以五億九千七百萬元作爲對奧。中·法·義四國臨時援助之用。核准之法案，現僅待杜魯門總統之簽字，以便復興銀公司預付一億五千萬交予國務院，以協助獲得援助之國家。衆院多數黨領袖海洛克稱，撥款委員會將於星期二日提出撥款之法案，以供辯論。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕參院撥款委員會主席勃里奇十五日稱，渠將於十七日再度聽取魏德邁將軍關於援華之辯論，但該委員會是否接受魏德邁之長期訪華調查報告尚未能斷定。仝時，該委員會將聽取蒲立特，周以德及美對華政策協會主席魯斯夫人反其他萬務部官員之辯論。據勃氏稱，在該委會在決定推蔗援華緊急基金之前，將要求國務院關於援助中國政策之文告。　　〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：華盛頓訊，衆院撥款委員會，已向衆院提出一議案，其中將國會核准之對外援助經費，削减八千八百萬美元，並將陸軍部要求之國外佔領區聲用，削减二億六千萬美元以上。　委會並提出補充撥款議案，其中規定兩點：　以五億〇九百萬美元作爲緊急援助費用，換言之，較十五日國會核准對法·義·奧·中四國之救濟費用，少百分之十五，　以二億三千萬美元作爲德國，日本，朝鮮，奧國美軍佔領區軍政府之費用，較陸軍部原先提出之四億九千萬美元减少百分之五十三弱。該委會對救濟國外計劃之健全性，表示懷疑。撥款委會在所提之議案中，並未規定援助中國之經費，雖此項援助業經國會通過，目下正待社魯門總統簽字矣。該委會認爲以款項撥予中國，並不適當，其理由爲對華援助之辦法，尚無計劃提出。對法·義·奧三國之援助，該委會亦懷疑其能否發生確切效果。撥款委會所削减之八千八百萬美元中，六千六百萬元係自對法援助中削减，另有二千二百萬元，則自對養援助中削減。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：華盛頓訊，特雷均將軍今日在撥款委會中發表意見，對該會大事削减美陸軍要求之國外佔領經費，認爲不當，因此項經費對於維持國外佔領區之秩序與安定，實屬必要。〔中央社華盛頓十五日電〕此間官方人士相信：馬歇爾於倫敦會議陷於停頓後，十九日返華府時，將加速進行援華計劃。　　〔中央社華盛頓十五日電〕美參議員范登堡在參院稱，鑒於中國迄今所獲得援助之微乎其微，中國實「有充份權利享有」美國之援助。范氏並告參院稱，渠與「美官方對華之立塲，實難融洽一致」，渠繼稱，渠曾屢次要求對華採取「另種不同態度」，但渠並未說明其政策。范氏稱，兩院聯席委會中之參議員，如堅持删除衆院所通過援助方案中對華援助部份，此則爲參院方面之「雙層偏見」，而致可能引起「對吾人對華基本態度之誤解」。渠重復稱，對中國之門，已經開啟，兩院聯席委會中之諾議員，成不願將門關閉。參院外委會民主黨著名議員康納利指稱，馬歇爾不久將向國會提出援華方案。渠聲稱，聯總結束後，救濟基金之下，尚未撥出之一千八百萬美元，外加救濟方案下之三千萬美元，可使中國渡過今年年關。文訊，僉料國會於十九日閉幕前，將通過撥款法案。</p>

<h3>防止遊資作祟在改革幣制</h3>
<p>流動資金得不到正當的出路與歸宿，便一齊變成了遊資。遊資過多，無可運用，又一齊奔注於投機市塌，釀成了囤積居奇的狂熱，更以囤積居奇，利潤優厚，開支减省，手續簡單，致原有的生產資金，亦紛紛變成遊資，爭流入投機市塲。於是遊資愈多，投機愈烈，物價愈漲，生產愈萎縮，經濟界愈混亂。現在整個國民經濟的主要敵人，可說：無邊於所謂遊資。</p>
<p>早在抗戰期間，如何疏導遊炎，或吸收遊資這個論題，已絞盡了許多人的腦汁；自從頒行經濟緊急揹施與經濟改革方案以後，各方對於這個問題，益形重視，並且採行過許多對策。但成效終極微細；相反地，遊資作祟的威力，似有與日俱增之勢，其原因究竟安在？今試將各種可能的防止辦法，分別檢討一下，作爲懲前毖後的參考。</p>
<p>抽緊銀根過去曾屢次施行過，現正加緊施行着。如停止貸款，堵塞匯款，加強金融機構的檢查等，其嚴密與澈底，俱爲前此所未有。其暫時所可發生的作用，當然未可一筆抹煞。但以國家種種需要，行局差進以後，不能不漸漸地差出。加以工商業正當的用途，與埠際問貨物的流通，一切貸款與匯款，終不能混統地長此停頓，致妨礙經濟界的生機。其他姑置不論，即如年關伊邇，各業正紛紛鬧着所謂年賞。這筆支出，在規模大些的公司行廠，往往須數十億，乃至數百億。倘或一味過止，不予融通，爲問這個難關，工商界如何渦得去？所以抽緊銀根這手段，只好說是暫時的，治標的，並不能根本解決這遊資問題。</p>
<p>拋售物資拋出國有的物資來，收進市塲上的法幣，這辦法比較地切實。問題是在　法幣回籠以後，能否即予扣住，不再放出來！　所拋物資究有多少？能否源源不絕地拋售？拿過去拋售黃金這例子來看，這政策顯然失敗了。</p>
<p>發行公債　這原是國家吸收遊資的正當辦法。可惜在幣値低落，與利率過低的情勢下，人民感不到興趣。美金庫劵發行的成續，便是很好的例子。</p>
<p>獎勵儲蓄　其難以奏效的原因，與上項同。現在銀行存息，旣決定不予提高，此路可謂走不通。</p>
<p>出售國營事業　這也是最理想的一修出路。可惜出售辦法，延不解決，而就已經公佈的出售國營事業，採用發行股票方式，組織銀團經募辦法來看，凡較好的部分，多予保留，其未來的管理權，又顯然操在國家行局及官股手裏。一般資本家，對此興趣如何，大是問題。</p>
<p>取締私人在放　這就是取締地下錢莊與商號存款了。商號存款，本是民間通行的習價，在行莊存息過低，與行莊放款嚴密限制的時候，如非有意把工商業予以全部窒息，這本是行不通的辦法。何况內地較小的市鎭上，根本還沒有行莊。如果傎的做到商號不許收受存款，試問這些存款，敎他們放到那裹去？這些商號，又到那裏融通去？至於地下錢莊，旣是非法組織，自應予以查禁。但在澈底禁絕以後，亦只阻塞了遊資活動的一條途徑，而遊資還是無法吸收的。</p>
<p>導入生產專業這是大家所熱切盼望的一個目標。其實人之求利，猶水之就下，只要有利可圖，何須定要國家引導，始肯從事生產？所情目前生產的環境太壞了，各方面所予生產上有意無意的障礙，又太多了。國家空言獎掖的力量，遠不如實際上所遭障礙的偉大；旣成的生產事業，尚在力求解脫，或苦於無法解脫，又孰育避易就難，以自尋煩惱？所以這條辦法，始終只是一句好聽的話兒罷了。</p>
<p>提高生活水準　就是要人民增加消費，以减少民間的遊資，這顯然不是我國目前所可走得通的途徑。因爲物資太缺之了，國家正在提倡節約，推廣配給，以限止浪費。各地的窮民與難民又太多了，此等民衆，根本無資可餘，亟待各方救濟，以苟延殘喘。又何從增加其消費！</p>
<p>增抽所利得稅　這也是一條走不通的路。廠因是現行人民的負祖，已經太重了。曾聽得某工業家訴苦，稱：以上兩稅，已經要剝去其利得百分之七十以上，其他種種捐稅，還不在內。而房捐，營業稅，使用牌照稅，營業牌照稅，誤樂捐等，最近又已增加，或正在商議增加。豈可一味地殺鷄取卵，再增重一般人民的負担，社會的貧富，現在太不平均，一般所得稅的制度，又並沒有建樹得起來。有許多捐稅的負担，最後往往轉嫁到中下級的身上去。所以籍加稅以收回遊資，在目前，是不宜再辦，實際亦是辦不通的。</p>
<p>提高日用品價　其結果等於加稅，當然亦不相宜。而且現正力求抑平物價，以安定民生，斷沒有採取相反的道路之可能。縱使可能，亦只有在全面配給或極權政治的國家，其日用品的定價，方可由國家完全作主，目前我國，實談不到。</p>
<p>以上各項，或已辦而寡效，或來加以試騐，或在表面上雖未試辦，而實際上已部分實施，而其無救於遊炎之汜濫則一。可知傎要疎導遊資，或吸收遊資，不可不另籌對策。其最爲切實而有效的，我們認爲：仍應從改革幣制，穩定幣値入手。</p>
<p>幣値如能穩定，則物價自然隨之而穩定，而投機與囤積之風，亦不待嚴禁而自戢。他如儲蓄之增加，公債之發行，與地下錢莊之沒落，又爲勢所必然的結果。所以近頃所傳改革幣制的擬議，應是解決遊資問題的惟一辦法。如果借款成功，基金有着，便當急起直追，斷然實行，不宜再放過還個機會。良以遊資問題，即是整個的國家經濟問題，他若生產建設，交通，運輸等項，都不過其中的一目。經濟不穩定，一切建設，俱無從談起。本末先後之別，不可不認識淸楚。倘或放着可以改革的機會不去改革，一定要等到馬克，盧布，克洛林那樣地步，然後再以鉅大的析扣予以兌換。則其所公表的理由，無論如何動聽，民衆所受到的損失，未免太大了。蘇聯爲制止通貨膨脹起見，已實行幣制改革，從昨日起新盧布開始流通，其所採取改革幣制的辦法，實在値得我們參攷的。</p>

<p>麥克阿瑟表示　日不能再武裝</p>
<p>華府與東京之美方負責人士，對中美兩國合作以解決日本和約一節，現均抱有厚望。麥帥個人希望中國能承認日本爲亞洲之一部份之事實，爲兩國之利益計，必須保持友好之關係。麥帥並曾表示：「日本決不致再成爲一軍事强國，咸脅世界和平，日本已完全解除武裝，而將來和約中必須規定條文，使日本永遠再不能武裝。目前所需要者，爲亞洲各國間之合作，以爭取友誼及繁榮。」</p>

<p>范氏對大琉球島之未來地位，認爲「外交界人士均相信，此島將在聯合國托治制度下，移交美國管理，因西太平洋之和平，實依靠美國之實力維持，需要大琉球作爲基地之用。」至於合灣，則任何人均同意開羅會議官言中，指明台灣爲中國之領土，而所有之美國人，均認爲台灣於目前及將來，均爲中國領土之一部份，合灣人民之極大多數，均屬於中國之種族。</p>
<p>蘇聯在五年內　無法造原子彈</p>
<p>范氏承認美蘇兩强間之緊張局勢，但尙不致發生戰爭。渠稱：「美蘇之間，尚無發生大規模戰爭之危機，主要理由爲蘇聯現在尚缺乏必需之武器。蘇方可能在理論上已獲悉如何製造原十彈，但在其能建立必須之巨大電力廠之前，事賞上無法從事製造，而此事之做到，至少尚需五年至十年。同時蘇聯迄無値得一提之海軍，而俄人深知歷史上從無不獲取海權，而能取得大戰之勝利者。此外，蘇聯尚缺乏工業製迭能力，以生產大量飛機，汽車，及現代戰爭所需之數千種用品，故所有之第一流專家，均認爲至少在十年之內，美蘇間不致發生戰爭。」</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕四强外長會議，由於英美法反對蘇聯之要求提取德國生產物作爲賠償，顯然巳無打開僵局之可能，乃於十五日之曾議中，經馬歇爾之建議，宣告本屆會議之無定期休會。今日開會之初，莫洛托夫爲移轉對於賠償問題之注意起見，要求其他三外長同意討論「德國人民大會」要求外長會議准許聆取德代表團意見之請求，英美法均表示此一請求不能接受，於是乃由馬歇爾建議恢復討論賠償問題。馬歇爾稱：關於賠償問題，吾人顯然業已陷入基本的分歧意見。蘇聯要求對蘇賠償額一百億元，按一九三八年價値計算，若按時價計算當達一百五十億元，顯然與波茨坦協定有悖，就實際的經濟原理而言，亦爲不可能之事。在此等要求之下，祇有同意使德人民陷於奴役地位，及整個歐洲之復興遭受嚴重阻撓，始能使四强成立協議。再就對奧條約言，亦因蘇聯所要求之財產權及特權，遠超自由獨立奧國所能履行之程度，而使吾人不獲成功協議。蘇聯始終拒絕供給關於移運德賠償物費之重要且必需的情報，並拒絕同意交出藉賠償爲名片面奪取之德財產，蘇聯之手段，使德國無從在復興歐洲之任務中担任其職務，且使英美不得不大量資助德國西部，以維持其生存。不意蘇代表反責英美此等援助爲企圖利用德西部，作爲反對歐洲民全國及推行擴大政策之戰略慕地。須知吾人若停止此等援助，則英美區內之四十萬德人，不免陷於集體飢饉之命運，總之，蘇聯旣單獨堅決拒絕同意，就其他各點繼續開會討論，亦屬徒然無利。本人主張無定期延期討論。員文於詳細重申英國之立塲後，亦曰，「歷史將為吾人之證人，吾人今不得不懷疑外長會議長後是否能够解決歐洲及德國問題。」莫洛托夫於馬歇爾建議無定期延會後聲稱，貝文馬歇爾之行動，顯然同出一轍，兩人均未邀守議程，且均忽略蘇聯建議，而法代表團對於英美所言，亦從無異議，可見英美法已採取一致陣錢，反對對蘇聯賠償。關於延會之議，此乃又一片面方式之行動，若三國代表團同意無定期延會，蘇聯當然亦不得不同意。惟此事之責任，全在其他三國代表團，與蘇聯無干。</p>
<h3>東西呈分裂局面　德國成為外交戰最前綫　西德聯邦計劃可能實現</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十六日電〕外長會議之破裂，已使德國·歐洲與世界分爲兩半矣·當然會議之失敗，並未使戰時天下一家之理想完全破滅，然西方各國之代表均一致認爲東方與西方之關係已惡化至不能在短期內恢復矣。各國代表均不願預料會議之失敗，對世界將產生何稱影響，此後四國外長是否尚能再度集會，實屬疑問，目前分裂之德國已成爲「外交戰上之最前綫」。</p>
<p>僉信英美法三國目前雖不致立即有所行動，然四外長之不能獲致任何協議，必然將引起下列之發展：　法國可望同意爲經濟之目的，而將其德國佔領區統一於已經合併之英美佔區。　英美法三國將加速在政治上統一德西部之討論，可能成立一臨時西德政府。　美國特別爲美國會，對馬歇爾計劃之支持將突然增强。</p>
<p>〔聯合社弗朗克福十六日電〕美國觀察家今日預測，德西部即將開始成立一臨時國家或聯邦，此爲四外長會議破裂之直接後果。英美佔區德政治領袖頃已着手籌備，促其實現。西德兩大政黨即右冀基督民主黨與左翼社民黨代表今日在此開會，以起草組織政府具體方案，茶本工作可望因而決定。據基督民主黨某要員聲稱，由於倫敦外長會議破裂結果，吾人目前除向此方面進行外，無事可爲。西部德國經濟危機對於西歐關係恭重，吾人統一實屬必要。觀察家深信英美佔區德人民將奉命成立區際經濟會議，八州州長屆時料將提出西德統一方案，以組織有限制的中央政府。</p>
<h3>薩爾義會　批准對法協定</h3>

<h3>國際委會在巴黎成立　積極推進歐統一運動　會員包括英法波荷比等國籍</h3>
<p>〔路通社巴黎十五日電〕宣揚歐洲統一運動之四團體，業已組成「歐洲統一運動國際委員會」，以統一各團體宣揚該運動之步驟。此四團體乃法急進黨領袖國民議會議長赫里歐領導之「法國統一歐洲委員會」，英保守黨領袖邱吉爾領第之「歐洲合衆國運動」，前比利時總理范齊蘭領導之「歐洲合作獨立同盟」，及勃魯格曼領導之「歐洲聯邦運動同盟」。該國際委員會已於週末在巴黎成立，由邱吉爾才婿「歐洲合衆國運動」之森第斯任主席，前波蘭總理萍柯斯基之機要室主任代表「歐洲合作獨立同盟」之賴丁格任秘書長，計劃在兩星期內在倫敦及巴黎設立辦事處。參加該國際委員會者係前述四團體之代表，包括英法荷比瑞士波蘭等國籍。據該委員會主席森第斯表示：「日子一天一天的過去，歐洲統一的需要更呈迫切需要，此一新機構的成立，使我們得以共同動行，加强我們的呼籲效力加强我們所宣揚的遝動力量。」</p>
<h3>美國會反響力主重建西歐</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕由於倫敦外長會議之流歡，此間議會乃要求應有一較强之西德，並要求停止將德國工業品運往蘇聯。各議曾巨頭力促英美法應　獨負起重建西歐之責任，然蘇聯領袖如能改變其心腸，則蘇聯參加之門未閉。馬歇爾可望於十九日返此向杜魯門總統與人民報告倫敦會議之經過，屆時各議晨即將向之提出「此後應如何進行」之問題。范登堡對倫教會議之破裂，尚未立即發表評倫，然參議員康納利則指出世界不能永遠等待東方與西方之妥協。渠暗示現爲西方各國在其佔領區內，決定德奧未來命運之時矣。</p>
<p>參院外交關係委員會委員史密斯亦爲力主西德集團者之一。議員弗格遜稱，倫敦会議之失敗，使美國有重新考慮對蘇聯要求賠款問題立塲之必要。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京十五日電〕日本外交家兩人，今日在推進日本加入聯合國運動中，首先直接反對麥帥提議之聯合國代管日本計劃。兩人一爲前外長佐籐，一爲前駐敎廷公使原田。據稱代管制不適用於日本，就日本人而論，和約成立後如需管制機構，則與共受聯合國監督，寗取遠東委員會各國，兩人此項言論係在日本聯合國同志會寗備會記者招待會發表，該會定於十七日成立，藉以教育日本人關於該機構之目標。佐藤任會長，原田任秘書長，會員中有外交家及敎授等人。該會謀於和約簽訂後，迅速促成日本成爲聯合國會員國。佐籘稱，盟國對於日本履行管制政策倘若滿意，則日本加入聯合國機構可於兩三年內實現。依照新憲法，日本須依賴聯合國機構保護，甚至將受其管制。佐籐被認爲今日日本第一流外交家，現任參議院外交委員會主席。佐籐爲日本最後一任駐蘇聯大使，故亦被認爲日本之蘇聯通。原田曾在舊國際聯盟秘書處服務十九年之久。</p>
<h3>日本朝野人士反對經濟改革　使政治改革毫無作用</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕美前鋒諭壇報今於社論中評論日本之種　改革，指出政治改革與經濟改革之重要異點，日本他員對於政治改革立即接受，而對於經濟改良，則勉强「幾乎在美國刺刀威逼之下」同意。該報所以指出此異點者，蓋欲提議相信日本於一夕之問，已發生思想革命之人士也。該報謂：不但保守及頑固人士反對經濟改革，即自稱爲自由主義人士及社會主義者，亦莫不如此。日本議會近奉麥帥之命所通過關於商業及工業之立法即可佐證。此次立法在美軍總部努力範圍之外，極難實施，故經濟改革只能在紙上施行，其實際結果往往欠佳，最明顯之例證，即土地改革產業法，雖已通過，然自地主（彼等熟烈支持日本黷武主義）方面取得而交於農民之產業並不多。該報於結論中並謂：大部份日本官員所以顯然同意採行政治改革而反對經濟改革者，蓋彼等極端反對往日之日本（即黷武主義者半封建地主及從事壟斷之資本家聯合統治之日本）有任何傎正之改革。此等官員能接受麥帥擬議實行之政治改革，而在表面上佯爲合作，然彼等可以憑藉反對經濟改革而於暗中破壞，使政治改革毫無意義。彼等認明如無經濟改革相棘而行，則政洽改革毫無作用。</p>

<h3>法國在挽回狂瀾（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐巴黎通訊員　沂若</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>〔本報巴黎通訊」法國自從十月全國競選地方議員之後，政局形成三派鼎峙局面，戴高樂與共黨誓不兩立，共黨與現任內閣決不妥協，而內閣與戴高樂又不投緣，彼此勢均力敵，誰也不頗示弱，誰都不能統治全局。弄得人心惶惶，物價沸騰，法郞不穩，工潮怒起。賴馬迪四出找人繼承，有一月之久（自十月廿日起）交相對持，誰也打不開這個價局。</p>
<p>依照這次投票的結果看來，擁護戴高樂的最多，擁護共黨的次之，但票數並未减少，所以兩者成了勁敵，各不相下，彼此又均屬在野黨，都想推倒賴馬迪而代之，把賴馬迪擠在中間，反不易推倒了。賴馬迪利用這左右的不和諧，連合在朝的四個政黨，以抵抗左右兩面的政勢。這四個在朝黨是：每選每挫的社會黨，競選慘敗的民衆共和黨，一落千丈的社會急進黨，以及亳無聲色的共和獨立黨。這四黨造成的第三種組合，在議會裏可握有三百張票，維持賴馬迪的地位有餘，（反賴馬迪的共黨只有一百八十四票）因爲組新閣的信任案須經過議會絕對多數——三百〇九票——始能有效·賴馬迪就欠這九張票，所以他的力量顯得薄弱，正渡着同舟共濟的命運，稍一不愼，很容易垮下台來。</p>
<p>戴高樂初試競選，一試便小露鋒芒，當時驚動了英美，引起法國當局的不安，第三種組合遂急遽產生，以謀抵抗戴高樂帶來的獨裁空氣，又免得左右一旦正面接觸，會發生內戰的恐怖。這次競選的目的，係改換各地的地方議員及重灣市長，並未影響到議會的組織，所以戴高樂派在全國九十二省中，雖獲到五十二省的地方多數議席，而在議會的實力很有限，計選前只有九席，選前有三十餘議員自民衆共和黨跳出來，傾心於戴高樂，左翼聯盟有三十人取同樣態度，合起來才七十二席，在金體六百十八席中，起不了什麽大作用，所以日前戴高樂招待各國記者時，便把他想要改選議曾的主張拿出來，無奈他是處身於一個法治的國家裘，一個將軍的命令，並不能隨便指揮議會。恢法律規定，議員任期四年，尚須三年方屆期滿。依過去歷史看來，法國決不輕易解散議會，除非有特殊局面。八十年來，只解散過一次，不像英國的議會，任期雖定了七年，但難得有坐到期滿的，這是英法憲議制的絕大異點，一般公法家們，據以炫奇，謂英國行政高於立法權，法國立法高於行政權，言之津津有味，聽者茫然；實則，習慣勝於人力，我國武槽勝於文權；不也是歷史傳下來的嗎？</p>
<p>議會改選的問題只好緩議，可是三足鼎立的政局，確不容易支撑。在野的兩黨掀風作浪，在朝的實在窮於應付，這中流砥柱，總經不起驚浪駭濤。這就是目前法國政局的象徵。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>汹湧澎湃的工潮，就可以說明法國政局的險惡。先是：工資問題，從年初賴馬迪上台後，即予凍結，滿冀物價貶値政策實現，兩相調和，社會得以安定，且可欣欣向榮；那知行了三月，物價未能减下百分之三，又過了兩月，却上漲百分之十，而工資仍在凍結。總工會軟弱地提出一個生產獎勵金來作爲補救的辦法，竟未被採用，共黨乘機退出內閣，以保特其在勞工方面的力量。五六月間，工潮一度爆發，物價繼續上漲，賴馬迪允許到七月再調整工資，旋又推到十二月再說；倔全方面看不下去了，自動與勞方訂立一個勞資協定，共同決議增加工資百分之十一以上（小的工資可增至百分之四十二，俾符合每月八千法郎的最低生活費），詎政府接到這項協定後，猶獲寡斷，在八月，拖延了一個整月，終而又拒絕了。物價仍在不停地上漲，一直超渦年初的百分之四十，這時薪水階級實在喘不渦氣來了，總工會於日前提出「加薪百分之二十五」的要求，以符「每月一萬零八百法郞的最低生活費」，常然毫無反響，於是在十一月十九日淸晨，法國北部的十萬多煤礦工人都拒絕下地挖煤，馬賽十多萬的肩夫，再也不管起貨卸貨，巴黎的十萬多鐵工，訛也不去打鐵了，罷工的狂潮，同時在全國發動。賴馬迪受到一個很大的壓力，看着實在有些鎭壓不住，遂萌退志</p>
<p>自從十月的選舉後，在野的左右兩派，比在瑚諸黨共收的票數多得多，賴馬迪的咸望下降，已不容諱言。在朝的民衆共和黨，想挽回競選慘敗的傷痕，遂提出改組一個强有力的政府的呼聲，以代替軟弱無能的賴馬迪。首先掀起閣潮的，由該黨黨會代言人勒固爾去向大總統提出此意。左翼聯盟一向不贊成政府的「統制經濟」，早想換換口味，該盟的社會急進黨黨魁赫理歐，以國民大會議長的地位，滿想把緩和黨的黨員勒耨抬出來，換個新局面，以緩和左右的極端化，同時以其理財的本領，把法郞穩定住，物價或會平穩。當政的社會黨，雖然每選每挫，但總想左右逢源，弄些好處。賴馬迪雖然無才，但自視非我莫屬；八月間，社會黨代表大會在里昻集議時，已觀察到賴馬迪不大振作，會決定幾項新方針，無奈事過境遷，決而不行；該黨中央執行委員會於這次普選後，曾籌商對策，準備賴馬迪不支時，由雷翁繼任之，則閣揆仍由社會黨主持，不致落於外人手中。於是，雷翁與勒耨，儼然爲未來內閣的主人翁，立刻開始徵詢各黨的意見，互去訪問大總統，隨時報告經過。法國從此步入動盟不安的局勢，一直到了十一月十九日下午，不斷地探詢，不斷地謀出路，以打開難局，那知中午已發生一椿事。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>十一月十九日早晨：法國有三十萬工人開始罷工；中午，英美記者公會宴請社會黨秘書長謀勒，席問請其發表對法國內政的見解。據謂賴馬迪將不久於閣位，繼任者將爲雷翁。這一個有聲有色的霹雷，引起了政潮汹湧中的狂瀾：勒耨聽了，立刻終止其米竟的諮詢工作；議會裏的民衆共和黨大爲詫異；左翼聯盟認爲這樣的換湯不換藥的社會黨政府，無補於實際；最爲驚訝的却是社會黨議員，因爲他們旣還沒有得悉前一天的晚上（十八日），賴馬迪已在社會黨幹部碰到一個釘子，擁護他的政策者已成爲少數了，又不曉得謀勒米經他們的同意，便擅自發表了黨內的「秘密」，覺得實在不妥；尤其是賴馬迪本人，有些沉不住氣，一方面被人視爲尸位素餐，一方面又逕行穴告了他的終塲，氣忿之餘，終於當晚九時，親去大總統的面前，遞了辭呈，法國的閣潮便從比開始。</p>

<h3>食米今起全面配給　每戶一紙憑證購買</h3>
<p>社局令米號呈報交易數額作參考　津浦綫存糧中信局洋米趕運來滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市致當局以最近本市米價上漲，攸關民生至鉅，決自今日起實行全面配給制度，俾米價得以抑平。吳市長爲此並於昨日下午五時半，在市府大禮堂招待記者，報告四點：　最近米價突然上漲，市府爲體恤貧戶起見，第二期益戶配米決全市實行。本市共計三十區，現已寬行配米者有七區，其餘二十三區，決自十七日起，全部配給，總數爲十一萬餘擔。至於工廠工人配米制，仍予繼續辦理。　津浦路上有儲存雜糧七十餘萬組，交通部俞部長及興政院張院長已允於短期內趕運來滬。　京滬綫方面，兩路局長陳伯莊允每天爲上海運食米一萬餘石來滬。　中央信托局於本月底前，可有　羅米三十萬擔運滬，屆時本市食米配給量即可望增加。又市府方面爲控制米價起見，決依照棉紗拋售辦法，一面實行全面配給，一面大量拋售，俾米價得以抑平。</p>
<p>又據市府消息：市政常局決實行食米全面配給制，業令社會局依照公用局現行之汽油購油證辦法，每戶一紙，註明姓名住址，並編列號碼，憑證購買食米。地區及數量暫不限制，惟承買商號對購買者須憑證逐一記錄，俾作查考。待此辦法基礎確定後，再實行定量分配，計口授糧制。社會局於奉令後，業已積極籌備，責成各米號將過去三個月之粳米，釉米及糯米三項買賣石數及來源塡報，俾作參考。社會局他將分區召集各米號業負責人談話。</p>

<h3>引水管理權航政局接管　罷工引水員入公會　另訂徵收費用標準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海區引水管理權已於昨日起由海關移交與航政局接管，航政局特增設引水科，由黃錫疇任科長，惟實際工作則委託銅沙引水公會負責，該會設辦事處於福州路　利韓大樓四〇七室。</p>
<p>前因罷工而被海關吊銷執照之海關引水員二十二人，除一人已離開中國外，其餘外籍十九人，華籍兩人，均已加入銅沙引水公會，恢復工作，英中西人喬爾頓及華人朱哲兩人仍担任新公會正副業務經理之職。銅沙公會原有華籍引水十八人中，現有金月石·秦錚如·吉增幹·李雲衢等四人開始工作，尚有兩人資歷較差，獲得實習地位，其餘十二人或因已有其他職務，或因資歷不够，均尚未參加。至於海關臨時僱用之白俄引水留用至本年底爲止因此現有引水人員已較原來海關管理時增加，本市航運已可暢通無處。</p>
<p>引水費用之徵收，已由航政局另訂新標準，通知各船公司照付，其計算方法，甚爲複雜，大抵以一萬噸重船尾吃水廿六呎之輪船自銅沙引至上海，其費用爲五千四百萬元，此項標準並每星期視實際情形調整。引水員之收入係照每月公會收入之總數分攤，由於船售進出時有多寡，故其數額並不固定。外籍引水原有照官價結付之美金五百元則已取消，而一律以國幣支付，但在新訂收黃標準下，彼等進款仍可較以前增加約百分之二十。</p>

<h3>江南全面淸剿　蘇省王主席發表重要廣播演詞</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十四日訊〕蘇省王主席以江南全面淸剿開始發動，頃特對全省三千四百萬民衆及專員，縣市長各級文武人員發表其有重大意義之廣播演說。茲節要如玖：</p>
<p>我們這一次江南全面淸剿，是與共匪爭生存，爲要保障全體人民的安寗，爲要一勞逸，我們有極堅決的信心來完成這個任務。同時本省近鄰京畿，淸除共匪，屛障有都，更是我們江蘇人的責任。</p>
<p>現在把江南全面淸剿期中，我們的認識和任務，分別說明：各專員縣市長</p>
<p>各專員縣市長</p>
<p>各級文武人員們：</p>
<p>縣長在淸剿期間，要經常不斷的下鄉，分頭召集區鄉鎭保甲長會議，完成三事。（一）剿匪，（二）編組各種民衆自衛隊，（三）督糧：都要如限完成任務</p>
<p>縣與縣間，村鎭與村鎭問的聯防，要確實組成，經常會剿會哨。每一村鎭，均以以民衆自衛隊輪流担任盤查，巡邏，日夜守望，尤其黑夜及黃昏拂曉要格外注意，不可使匪通過，或秘密集合。各村應製備更鼓　鑼，每晚打更守望，如發現匪蹤，立刻要鳴鑼報警，羣起打匪，鄰村守望相助，會合兜剿，切勿任匪此剿彼竄。</p>
<p>各縣要重視民衆自衛組織的力量，依照中央頒發的民衆自衛隊組訓規程「并本人不離槍槍不離鄉就地選官就地籌糧」的原則，健全編組：甲，有待過的民衆自衛隊，爲，（一）縣常備自衛中隊：（二）鄉鎭常備自衛班；以現有槍枝及登記民槍儘量使用，其待遇經費由縣統　統支，歸縣長統一指揮，隨時主動機動搜剿散匪，要經常活動，不可過於制式。乙，不脫離生產的民衆自衛隊爲（一）甲種民衆自衛隊；（二）照甲種自衛隊編制的城區民衆自衛組織；凡全縣十八歲以上四十五歲以下的壯丁都應依照規定納入組織，除以編組常備隊班有餘的槍枝撥充使用外，再以大刀標槍手榴彈爲輔，人人手上都要有一武器，並訓練使用技術，分別担任盤查巡邏警衛救護輸送等任務，遇有匪警，尤應羣起合力對匪拚命，以有搶的民衆自衛隊作中心，人人奮力，使匪不能脫逃。</p>
<p>縣長要督同區鄕鎭保甲長，將全縣每一村莊挨戶淸查戶口，擠出潛伏的共匪，區鄕　保甲長及村民均負有檢舉之責，一一查明，以少數武力突擊搜補共匪潛伏份子，不但將共匪武力淸除，匪的黨政組織及特工人員一一要捕捉凈盡。</p>
<p>由縣以至區鄉鎭保甲，要有嚴密的諜報綱，經常偵察匪情，密報縣長及就近部隊，立予搜捕撲滅。</p>
<p>本省遵照六省淸剿檢討會議的決定，採用軍事體制，已宣佈江南為警備區，江北為綏靖區，所有徵治盜匪案件，一律　軍法審理，並目爲削平叛亂，因應剿匪緊急措施之必要，本人爲專員縣長負資任，對於剿獲之重要匪犯，具有緊急處置必要者，審訊明確報省，提經省府會議核定先予執行。其次要人犯，予以長期監禁管訓，以免爲匪作倀，影響治安，此項辦法已呈報中央並通令實行。我們要明白共匪是社會上的毒菌，是殺人放火的暴徒，如果放縱了匪，大多數善良民衆即要被匪殺害，對少數惡人的姑息，就是對多數好人的殘忍，所以不得不嚴刑峻法，微治盜匪，換言之，正是爲了整肅紀綱保障全體人民的生命財產，各縣必須堅持剿匪的決心，把共匪的毒菌拔得乾乾爭爭。同時遵照中央命令，嚴格執行，匪盜案件在未審結前，任何人概不得保釋。</p>
<p>本省分防各縣的保安部隊，水警人員，和各縣團警文武人員都應配合全面淸剿任務，努力緊張工作，尤其團警方面，負有保衛地方的責任，要抱定「有匪無我」﹁有我無匪」的決心，經常主　機動白日暗夜出動，帮助縣府清查戶口，並注重紀律，分防在外時，尤應秋毫無犯，自行整飭紀律，武力與民衆打成一片，才是傎正的民衆武力，方能得到民衆的協助和擁護。</p>
<p>各縣民意機關</p>
<p>和地方各界領袖們：</p>
<p>各位對於共匪的殘暴都一致痛恨，意志的堅强和認識的正確異常可欽可佩，於此全面淸剿期中，盼一致　起協助各級政府，完成動員　亂國策，並且要隨時隨地喚起民衆一致奮起和匪拚命。主席蔣在六省淸剿檢討會議中說過，對於剿匪需要的措施，必須努力貫澈，不可有任何阻礙，並面諭各省主席轉告各民意機構一致勞力協助完成此一偉大使命</p>
<p>各種因種剿匪需要的措施，如組織民衆自衛武力，團警公敎人員的待遇和服裝經費，架設電訊交通，辦理保甲戶籍，構築碉堡工事，都是很繁重很緊要的工作，沒有堅强的組織和努力，不能澈底肅淸共匪，確保社會安寗。目前地方財政艱窘，而剿匪措施刻不容緩，我們的民意機構利各界領袖，已深切明瞭　咱事實，并盼告訴全體民衆提高　匪爭生存的意議，出抗體戰時期的精神，有錢出錢，有力出力，全體民衆的力量，就是我們　銅　鐵壁。月前本人因徐州外　軍事緊張，飛徐與顧　司令面商　劃加強徐州城防工事，召集地方人士商議，很短的期間由　集了兩百億元的鉅數工款，由陸總部會同地方各界主持辦理，其工款大多數爲產業金融界所　納，以徐州迭經兵燹工商凋敝的社會，猶能集此鉅款，且民氣堅毅勇敢，實足佩許。尤盼江南社會人士，以此種精神，共謀協力，建立江南治安。</p>
<p>田糧賦稅，是合法的正供，尤其田糧一項，因配合戡亂需要，更需踴躍繳納，加緊征收，任何一個國家的人民都有完糧納稅的義務，共匪企圖阻撓糧政並破壞良善的租佃關係，陰謀煽動抗糧抗租，對地主富戶以沒收財產爲恫嚇，以遂其勒糧勒丁之陰謀，我們要認識共匪的詭計，共匪嫉視糧政役政的順利進行，正是我們所應該努力貫澈的；共匪以地主富戶作鬥爭對象，所以大戶尤該倡導完糧，方能協助剿匪任務的完成，自身的生命財產才有保障。</p>
<h3>鄕鎭保甲長　和全體民衆們</h3>
<p>鄉鎭保田長爲基層政治之基石。對轄境居民。應負責編查戶口，檢舉共匪潛伏份子，其有匪不報或不能於事前發覺任匪隱匿者，以庇匪治罪。</p>
<p>人民發現匪蹤，須立即密報該管鄉鎭保甲長，鄉鎭保甲長應立即密報縣府，并以突擊方式迅速搜捕解縣法辦。人民對其毗鄰潛區匪蹤者，須負責檢舉，如有匪不報，依照聯保運坐之規定，以庇匪治罪。</p>
<p>苜鼠兩端之自治基層人員，山縣逐一查察整汰，照匪治罪。</p>
<p>鄉鎭保甲長及人民不可爲匪掩護，如任匯征糧勒款，以及通匪，議匪，縱匪者，一經查明，照匪治罪。</p>

<p>所謂氣喘之「噴霧療法」，即　用一種或數種藥物，　水蒸氣之噴霧，使　之效用，直達患病者之氣管枝，而奏功能，　氣喘一刻不停之　作，實為氣管枝所起　　，此種噴霧療法，足以舒緩氣管枝之　　，而减少其發作，病狀乃大見輕減矣。</p>
<p>患氣喘症者每日宜施用噴霧療法二次，劇烈發作時。不妨多用數次，其效尤為顯著。</p>
<p>施噴霧療法時，將噴霧器對準患者口鼻，並用特製之面罩，蒙　頭部，使藥力直達氣管，關於噴霧時所用之藥物，宜隨病症之輕重及病原之不同，隨時酌用，因病而施，方顯效力，更宜細撿，若爲心臟性之氣喘，（即虛喘症），則不宜用此種噴霧療法，故病者宜先求醫診斷而後施用。</p>
<p>噴霧所用之器械，必須特製，尋常私人診所中，大都不備，因感其施術之麻煩，上海中醫院特備有此器，以隨時應病者之需要，予會用此治愈氣喘症多人，且有熟習之護士管理此事，故較爲穩妥也。</p>
<h3>婦女「傷寒症」</h3>
<p>— 沈仲理</p>
<p>婦女傷寒症，與男子原無所異，但多月經適來之候，因此變化多端，不可不辨，亟須診斷詳明，方不致誤，按傷寒症之名，乃通俗之稱，尚非正名，値此冬令而病傷寒，是謂冬溫，亦即西醫所謂之副傷寒是也，其初起之症象，發熱形寒，頭痛且暈，四肢痠軟，胸悶泛噁，舌白膩，脈濡數，如夾月信適臨，來而不多，色鮮或暗，兼有血塊，帶下甚多，腹痕不舒，甚則發熟不退，胸脅刺痛，用藥應予速解風寒，發汗退熱，佐入活血理氣之劃，當有效騐，倘熱度增高，則防熟入血室，而致神昏譫語，循衣摸床，則宜加入洩熟行血，開竅清神之劑，庶幾熟隨血散也。</p>
<p>有孕而病冬溫，身熱甚壯，得胎六七月者，應急用護胎之法，古法用井底泥途腹，今則可改用水袋　腹，或冷水毛巾均可，藥用瀉熟安胎，急進黃連石膏之劑。</p>
<p>産後病溫，輕者惡露色鮮夾紫，小腹　　，胸悶頭脹，重則惡露忽淨，神志昏慣，多有撮空之狀，甚爲駭人，初起用藥如當歸桃仁山甲生地川芎之品，重則投以犀角丹皮銀花連翹之品，並有發斑發疹者，最爲兇險，經騐禮富之醫師，對症施藥，當有出險入夷之望也。</p>
<h3>骨病概論龜背</h3>
<p>— 陶慕章</p>
<p>骨癆一症，童年患者較多，何以故，以幼年骨質柔脆，一經　傷，常時雖啼哭呼號，爲父母者，以爲偶然之傾跌，不爲介意，不知傷處一時不能驟復，久之則骨膜受損，化膿高突，而外皮無腫無痛，且此症潰後，東竄西走，遊擊之遊擊，漫無定所，故治骨癆與別科異，非以杜根之法，不能止其流竄之勢。</p>
<p>且也，此症潰後，變化尤多，膿水淸稀，如豆漿，如腐水，如日旣久，人身之精液，悉由此漏洩，而色　白，形容枯槁，午後肌熱，險象環生。</p>
<p>吾人之骨骼，猶房屋之鋼骨，至爲重要，母得傾倚，而脊骨猶房屋之正樑，更顯重要，龜背一症，西名脊椎炎，背脊微凸或腰背覆重，此症由虛勞得之，所謂結核性脊椎炎，以强健之人，飲食入胃，輸津四怖，四肢百骸，俱堅張有力，一病　　所有豐富之　液，佳好之營養，俱爲癆菌侵蝕殆盡，脊髓無由生，且也此種病菌深伏病所，初祗侵蝕骨隙，及至骨膜腐蝕已成　原之勢，故此症初起最宜注意，不可有絲毫忽略，如覺腰部微微　重，應即延良好之骨科，施以手術，一面授以相當之藥餌，強化病者之抵抗力，而尤重要者保護腐骨四周之好骨，母使蔓延，以治病如救火，火勢蔓延，燎原莫救，優良之救火員，往往推倒牆壁以壓平火勢，其理正同，共他梅毒性及外傷性之脊椎炎，自當施以應病療法，茲不復贅。</p>
<h3>冬令峻補品鹿茸</h3>
<p>— 胡光軒</p>
<p>鹿茸爲國藥著名補劑，習用已久，冬令尤為服此種補劑最適宜之時期，據研究此中含有名貴之鹿茸精，實為內分泌腺也。</p>
<p>鹿茸乃鹿角之初生者，含血而尙未成骨，如草之嫩芽，柔軟如茄子狀，出關東者最著名，大抵採葺太嫩則血氣未具，實力少，太老則血液乾枯而力薄，以長四五寸，形如分歧之馬鞍，端如瑪瑙紅玉，純係血液者曰血片，效力頂好，其次如蜂窩者者曰沙片，又次與骨毗連，同角相仿，效力最薄。</p>
<p>鹿茸乃竣補強壯藥，補精血，强筋骨，體質陽虛者最宜，若服食不善，一次驟服多量，或體質陰虛者；服之往往發生鼻血吐血，目赤頭暈等弊，宜由醫者審查其體質之宜否，更决定服食之多少，總以一次服少量，多服數日，最爲妥當也。</p>
<h3>十全大補膏</h3>
<p>— 陳志惠</p>
<p>中國藥物之效力，實勝於西藥，因其適宜於國人體質之故，補劑亦然，際此冬令，乃進補之良好時期，經濟充實者當以延醫處膏滋方，量其體質而配藥，最爲合宜，次焉者可購服十全大補膏，亦頗適官，概十全大補膏中備有補氣補血之藥，如人參，茯苓，白朮，甘草，當　，熟地，白芍，川　，黃　，肉桂，凡人氣血充足則身體壯健，如平時勞傷或思想過度，則形瘦體倦，耳鳴頭眩，諸處百損，此膏大補氣血，自有偉效也。</p>
<h3>孕婦之惡阻</h3>
<p>— 蔡柏春</p>
<p>婦女受孕後月餘，每發輕微之噁心嘔吐，此謂惡阻，乃屬生理的變象，輕者不須延醫治理，欲减少其發作，祗須注意調節飲食，以易消化而有營養者，而避免刺激性食品，尤以平常厭惡之食物，勿使接近，否則最易引起嘔吐，閒時可作種種消遣及談笑以遺忘之。</p>
<p>惟劇甚之惡阻，每見嘔噁漸趨劇烈，甚致逢飲必嘔，逢食必吐，即空腹時胃中無物可吐，嘔出黃水亦不止，口乾唇裂，頭痛失眠，不思飲食，缺少營養，延成重篤，有造成小產之危險，應當加以治療者也。</p>

<h3>當局凖備拋售大批食糧　米市漲風可望遏止　社會局調查米號存銷數量　違令不報者將予吊銷執照</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市因連朝天雨，昨到貨比較稀少，共七千五百七十六石五斗。白粳做價曾高翔至九十八萬新高蜂，結果以九十二萬收盤，較上日猶低落五千元。據社會局　　科長古明齊稱，今日可繼續回小，當局已備有大批各色米糧，於必要時可以向市塲拋售。一待天氣放晴，來源增裕，米價即可下落。</p>
<p>社會局前為防止商民　積糧食，及明瞭本市正確需要量，以使政府供應起見，時飭令全市各米號每月造表呈報進貨銷貨及存貨數量。全市向米號　同黨公會登記之會員共一千六百家，十月份與十一月份遵令造表具報者，約佔一表。社會局對違令不報者，初步擬予警告，如再　令，即予吊銷執照　分。</p>
<h3>雜糧銷路清淡</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧七千五百餘石，店方因價高，門市出手困難，納胃見懈。市况早漲午跌，結局粳米早薄稻中次反見軟化，軋次一二萬元，　元米亦平正。麵粉去化仍旺，價格步升。麩皮漲萬元。豆餅去胃轉淡，臨收急轉直下，降三五千元。黃豆客銷清淡，本街不貪，油廠不動，挫跌萬元。挫落二三萬元。豇豆交易仍呆，步削萬元。紅糧去化最為呆滯，竟少受主。苞米亦回跌一二萬元。生仁廣帮轉淡，本街看望，價低一二萬元，形勢不振。芝蔴天津停辦，油廠不動，續挫一二萬元。黑蔴胃呆少神。</p>
<h3>油市全面下降</h3>
<p>豆油廠方供應按連，回跌三五萬元。菜油芝蔴相繼挫跌五六萬元。淸油亦見疲二三萬元。生油則隴海來源雖接，蘇北到貨不弱，靑島及魯中，亦有到貨。長江略有見抵，供多於求，人心軟化，狂瀉十餘萬元。</p>
<h3>食糖實銷活潑</h3>
<p>昨糖市因實銷活潑，漲勢較緊。白糖升四五萬元至七萬許。靑赤糖升三五萬元不一，公會劃盤，二四粗白現貨大包一百三十三萬元，二〇台中砂白一百三十萬元，台赤價格相仿，號貨油提靑九十八萬元，新順德青九十七萬元，海南赤貨較次，九十八萬元，興化白袋裝高貨，一百三十萬元，簍裝一百二十四萬元，興赤一百十五萬五千元，刁靑九十四萬元。後另星又開九十六萬元，統共成交一千五百件之譜。聞白糖午後非正式交易，價稍回鬆。</p>
<h3>銀根緊迫客銷不暢　紗布市價均回跌　現棉因廠需甚殷脚地堅硬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况晨開减價略挺，旋以本客兩帮需求不暢，銀根步見緊迫，同業困於頭寸，頗多斬售，行情盤低。迨至收時，複製廠商乘低略有進取，市勢微回。但結果四十二支藍鳳細紗，較之上日仍續跌六十萬元，為四千八百四十萬。此外各支粗細紗價亦挫小一·二十萬至百萬不等。</p>
<p>棉布市况轉瀉</p>
<p>棉布市况初開平穏，旋因銀根益緊，迫於頭寸者頻加吐售，尤以山西帮賣出更多，塲內進戶稀少，市呈供過於求，行情直瀉，迨近收時，單帮客戶零星收吸，散戶乘低拖進，市勢轉定。結果十二磅龍頭等各檔細布一致回跌三·四·五萬元，嗶嘰直貢及漂布價亦下游三·五萬元，惟色布及士林布脚地尙堅。此外灰光斜洋傘廠進胃甚佳，行情做好萬元左右。</p>
<p>現棉走勢硬朗</p>
<p>昨日現棉走勢硬朗，日來因銀根緊急，賣買變方，交易半停半做，市况盤旋。惟因來源不旺，實銷不减，紗廠需要甚殷，故雖在銀根緊急中，改用棉紗掉花，展開交易。價格先平後堅，終以棉紗回軟，欲漲乏力。全日成交七百包，一五四〇担。送廠價做開洛陽五二九萬一千，大中集五一二萬五千。又掉廿支紗做開紗市五四〇担，掉紗一〇〇件。大中集一，一〇〇担，掉紗二〇〇件。共成交二〇〇包，一五四〇担棧交價做開紗市四五四萬七千，靈寳四九六萬，成交五〇〇包。籽花九四萬。</p>

<h3>絲綢一致挫落</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市續萬元，降，因配貨週四繳款，綢廠商毫無納胃，以致人心軟弱。一二〇號旭字一A有光上午開盤喊七百萬元，乏人過問，午降至六百萬元收盤。下午因銀根奇緊，求售更殷，行情節節下降，最後喴二百萬元賣出價，較上日低落六百萬元。期貨賣出價，在八千萬元左右。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>市况趨疲，昨日行情再見低落，因細廠均有配貨，以致交易　稀。上午高另担有幾担成交，價做九千萬元，有四五個期頭。下午再告低降，喊八千九百萬元，並無成交。CD等級，討價在九千一二百萬元之左，比上日降落二百萬元，千經亦趨下游，普通另担在六千八百萬元左右。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市升沉不一，眞絲被面華强貨開盤五百七十萬元有成交，旋因供求失衡，步步後退，最小跌至五百萬元。不乏乘低進補，乃告回堅，收市即期價做五百四十萬元。大誠貨五十五萬元，美亞貨七十萬元，人造絲貨因原料低落，且銀根奇緊，行情參差甚詎。華錦縐普通貨約在七萬元左右。</p>
<h3>紡調與民營紗廠　進一步交換意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會主委表良，於昨日下午四時許，邀約民營紗廠各首腦王啓字，唐星海，榮爾仁，劉靖基等四人談話。對花紗布管理之實施方案，曾作進一步之意見交換。袁氏並面囑王氏等轉知六區公會所屬會員紗廠，從速塡報各廠存棉量，需棉量，存紗量，以及棉紗產銷等各項統計資料，俾資存查核辦云。</p>
<h3>棉花攙水攙雜　花紗業希望切實取締</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國原有各省棉花檢騐受多年戰亂影響，紛紛裁撤。致年來各地產棉。攙水攙雜之惡風，又吿盛行。大好棉產，坐令人為暴殄，致品質日趨低落，殊屬可惜。花紗各關係方面，咸盼負責常局，從速恢復各地產收進處，巳積極與各省建設廳，籌備恢復各省檢驗機構。迄目前為止，各省業已成棉花檢驗所者，有江蘇，浙江，湖北，陜西，河南等五省。江蘇省棉花檢驗所，共所嘉定，浦東，通海三檢驗區，並在太蒼，寳山，常熟，周浦，海門等地設騐查站。浙江省檢驗所共分寗波蕭山二檢驗區，在餘姚設有騐查站。湖北省檢驗所共分襄樊，隨棗，荆沙，天　，鄂東等五檢驗區，並分在老河口，隨縣，監利，仙桃鎭等地設騐查站。陜西省檢驗所共分渭南，涇陽，朝邑，咸陽四檢驗區，分在華縣，三原，永樂，高陵等地設騐查站。河南省檢驗所設鄭州檢驗區，分在開封，商邱，新鄕等地設騐查站。預料檢驗工作積極展開後，各省產棉品質可望日益提高云。</p>
<p>又棉產收進處本年在全國各省推廣美棉良種，總數共達七三〇一五市担。黃河流域各省，以斯字棉居多。長江流域各省，以德字棉珂字棉居多。各省推廣改良種之担數，以江蘇佔首，共達一九五一一担。次為河南，共一七八六六担第三為湖北，共一四六一三担。其次均在六千担以下，最少為江西，僅一六八担。</p>
<h3>銀根空前奇緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨銀根空前緊聯，暗息高達二角七以上。若干商業行莊廠商感覺週轉困難。四行二局昨差進二二二六億，中央入四九六億　，大交換出七三億，外商入四一五億。小交換出二五六七億，中國入一二六五億，其他行局均一致差進。</p>
<h3>金管嚴查退票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金廠管理局，自上週成立後，即積極部盤展開工作。對行莊退票，及當日票據抵用兩事，尤極力注意取締。聞日前該退票情形，至入晚十時許始吿離去。致該日交換所各行莊頭寸，延至次晨三時許，始吿軋齊。</p>
<h3>俏勢不未能持久　華股後市轉疲</h3>
<p>華股昨情况飄忽，銀根之威脅加電，塲外查賬加緊，中途雖有小型股之刺激，一度轉俏，但永紗未能越過前日高峰，小股亦略見力竭，俏勢未能持久。</p>
<p>晨初以銀根奇緊，人心難振，上塲見低。永舷梯以四六一元及四七〇元開市，開後再跌至四五九元及四六四元。華豐及內衣漲到倅板，小股　股奇俏，人心一振，逐漸漲到即交四七三元，遞交四八六元高價。逢高有人了結，塲外息價開高至三角及三角四分，仍無人收貨，永紗終難有較長久之穏定，回降至四五一元及四五七元。此時小型股尙見秀色，小心穏健而略盤。近午迫降至四四八元及四五六元低價，而後以四五〇元及四五七元之價收市。永業忽漲達限度。結果較前收即交股華豐漲停後微回，再昂一成。閘北內衣漲停後有回，軋升少許。永業漲停，新華五和中興亦升一成弱。火柴跌半成，中紡升半成，永紗中法永公景綸商務榮豐微降。大通平平，餘咸小升。遞交股華豐景福尙平，永紗美亞微挫，新光信和微升。</p>
<p>後市一一二號二一九號一六〇號三六號六五號一九七號八號八三號脫手，美貸六千萬傳說又起，國行交換差進甚多，逐步迫降至即交四四七元，遞交四四八元。買戶漸多，塲外又復較塲內之遞交為高，三六號補空，回升至四五五元及四六五元左右。收前復疲，以四五四元及四五七元之價收市，結果較晨收即交股計中紡跌一成，勤興景綸降半成不到，中法永公平平，餘股升降俱微。淚交股華豐跌半成，永紗平平，餘均小挫。塲外各老股大生復好半成，餘均平穏。</p>
<h3>統債續漲　外股過程平淡</h3>
<p>公債昨賡續趨漲，成交約七百萬。五五五室五五二室均進，五〇〇室三六〇室則出。統丙晨開三三五〇〇元，商價三四五〇〇元，低價三二七〇〇元，而後形成盤局。較前收計甲乙升二千一，丙漲二千四，統丁升一千八，統戊好起一千二。</p>
<p>外股昨以業外刺激見疲，買戶觀　而吿餒敗。惟成交不多，過程平淡。怡紗自四二五〇〇〇元起，微降至四一〇〇〇〇元左右結束。較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐紙版鋼業電話各跌半成，怡啤航業電車祥泰自來火及橡皮股各跌一成，業廣微降。</p>
<h3>傳廠盤將提高　肥皂行情飛俏</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂市面，因傳黃祥茂廠盤提高至八十二萬元配售之說，塲內　戶活躍，各方納胃奇暢，行情飛俏，結果固本皂猛漲十三萬元，為一百十一萬元。箭刀皂升十二萬，為一百零八萬元。黃祥茂升十萬元，其他各皂，市亦堅挺。</p>
<h3>二十餘種鋼鐵　加成問題議定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局無證自備外匯到埠貨品審議會議會，昨舉行第八次會議，除紙張收購價格業已決定照起岸價加百分之五十五外，鋼鐵廿餘種加成問題均巳分別議定，俟明日與各進口商取得協議後，即可公佈。再配售合約格式，亦巳擬定，聞下次審議會將討論森林材五金之加成事項云。</p>
<h3>呢羢交易瑣碎　僅派力斯有成交</h3>
<p>呢羢票凖，昨來大部份仍多保持現狀，交易仍以零碎居多。頭寸緊張者，因年關將到，爭先出籠。反之，銀根鬆裕者，均有乘機吸進之意，但多限於派力斯凡立頂春花呢等。最近頭號派力斯每碼成交價為七十五萬元，二號七十萬元。</p>
<p>茶市昂俏</p>
<p>昨日茶市：交易依然缺乏寳際，緣因仍受陰雨密佈之影響。買戶賡續袖手帝觀，而執貨心思，反比隔日帶挺。且喊價迂迴微升，是以市氣較形昂俏。</p>

<h3>評話小識</h3>
<p>— 戴不凡</p>
<p>魯迅「中國小說史略」頁二三一（北新五版本）：『今古奇聞二十二卷，題「東璧山房主人編緝」，其所錄頗陵維，有醒世恒言之文四篇（十五貫戲言成大禍，陳多　生死夫妻，張淑兒巧智脫楊生，劉小官雌雄兄弟），別一篇為西湖佳話之梅嶼恨蹟，餘未詳所從出』這一節有兩點似可加以補正：</p>
<p>一·「今古奇聞」卷十七「吳保安酬知已忘家」共分一·二兩回，第一回說的是吳保的故事，第二回則叙六生事。「吳保安棄家贖友」，原出處是「古今小說」，「今古奇觀」中亦曾輯入，不過被「東　山房主人」改為「酬知已忘家」後，已經刪改了許多。這一點，或許是魯迅作書時的疏忽吧？</p>
<p>二·「奇聞」卷十五「士無行實財甘居下賤」，是抄改節錄「石點頭」第八卷「貪婪漢六院賣風流」的。「石點頭」中那位貪官名呌吾受陶，含義為做陶朱公；「奇聞」則名盍有之，亦有所隠。我曾校讀兩文，發覺其中不少語句是相同的。（文長，不錄），情節上亦大致相同，差別最大的地方是：吾受、愛陶開了妓院以後，有一位汪商來嫖六院，在各院題詩一首嘲笑報復，而「奇聞」則略去；吾愛陶之死是由於突然昏厥，寃鬼附身；蓋有之則由於盜案株運，被打屁股，加上兒女不肖行為，才氣得發昏而見鬼的。</p>
<p>「今古奇聞」二十二卷除了魯迅指出的五篇以外，現在又可多明白一篇又「半」的出處了。如果繼續去尋，或許還可以發現一些吧？</p>
<h3>詞的感覺</h3>
<p>— 王夢鷗</p>
<p>有些文學作品似是要求語言之具象化，往往在文名底組織上結集多量的名詞，有許多地方像在開列雜貨店的淸單，有的如同傢具的目錄。作者借用這具象化的物體名稱，有時確可簡化讀者接受作者平頂山托於語句裏的意象之過程。並且有時為　代表不同物象底名詞之適常地配合，會互相映現出另一種聯想的意象和感覺。</p>
<p>其實，這種作用在詩作中是更早被利用了。作者利用感覺底昇華以移情於詩的境界，不管其預期的詩境是如何高妙，但其立脚却脫不掉一般官能的經驗。換言之，作者要借詩作來導人入於超經騐的境界，有時就是托藉那一般經驗為其橋樑。比組紅的雨，這是超出我們底經騐的，而李賀有：『桃花亂落如紅雨』，這裏以桃花亂落底一般經騐來創造一種新的意象，又由這新的意象和一般經驗之互相映現出作者所預期底詩的境界。</p>
<p>這在我國詩學所討論底賦比興問題上，凡一句中用着「如」，「似」，「若」，等等字眼，大槪都是悜於「比」底範圍。如蘇軾的「故人各在天一角，相望落落如晨星」，落落的情形無以說明之，於是托藉一般經驗中對於晨星底堅覺來映現其詩的境界，而省去無數不必要且又不具體的描述。然而，這旣是借用具象的名詞以遂行其索物言情之詩作，有許多是可以省却「如」，「似」，「若」等等字眼的，比如白居易畫竹歌「西業七莖勁而健，省向天竺寺前石上見；東業八莖疎且寒，憶曾湘妃廟裏雨中看」。這裏作者所感覺以為勁健和疎寒兩種不同的竹底情態，要借一般的經驗表明之，於是有天竺寺前石上和湘妃廟裏雨中之具體的比况；儘管我們對於天竺寺和湘妃廟都沒有印象，但，寺廟與石上的竹和雨中的竹，總是一般經驗過的。有這立脚的經驗，就可以映現作者所輿勁健和疎寒的情態。</p>
<p>不過，這還是用具象的名詞以求達到抽象的意念之具象化，此外，有的本來是具象的東西而又以具象的名詞表出之，如傳玄的『美女一何麗，顔若芙蓉花』，這是利用一般經騐中的芙蓉花使其所謂美女更加具象化了；又如樂簡文的『十五頗有餘，日照杏梁初』，杜牧的『　　嫋嫋十三餘，豆蔻梢頭二月初』；這裏儘管我們對於杏梁，豆蔻沒有印象，但杏梁初日，二月花梢，由這種經驗所蘊畜着的感覺必然是一般的，故可從具象的名詞而導人作者之意中人感覺中。用植物名詞如此，用動物名詞亦如之。王安石的『駑駘自飽方爭路，覆　長飢不在閒』『衰根要路知難植，倦羽長年欲退飛』這裏敎人所經驗的是動物或植物，但所感覺的則是人，又有和這相反的，如陳去非茶花詩；「靑裙白面初相識，十月茶花路開」這是利用我們對於靑裙白面素淡女人的經驗而導入作者對於十月茶花感情。雖然這是以人比花和以花比人底作用相同，但由白面靑初所綴合的名詞還嫌不够具體，如白居易的梨花詩：「最傳孀閨少年婦，白妝素面碧紗初」。這是利用具象化的白妝，素面，碧紗裙等名詞之配合以救孀閨少婦之具象化，然後以這十分具象化的孀歸一種感覺來導引我們進入作者對於梨花底感情。這裏關於茶花的詩句，或即脫胎於梨花的詩句。但無論如何，梨花的詩句總較茶花的詩句更為平易近人，原因即在他底造象是立脚於更一般性的經驗上。</p>
<p>我們底想像，往往是拘限於經驗的範圍，沒有經驗，便很難於想象。有之亦祗是對於不同的個體之經驗底複合化而已。文學作品，用具象化的各個名詞之配合以求達到一種所謂超經驗的詩境或即循是之由。然而物體的名詞常隨時間空問底不同而差異，這裏的時空差異作用，會成為經驗的　滓，使經驗有時亦失却作用，如李商隠的「金蟬　鎖燒香入，玉虎牽絲汲井回」，金蟬玉虎是什麼？必待注解，必等拂去經驗的　滓而後才可以想像的。但是，如溫庭均的「澁浪浮　砌，晴陽上綵旂」，澁浪是什麼？若使我們對之毫無經驗，那它只是詩句中死的細胞。</p>
<p>然而上例　是利用具象的描寫以强調感覺的。較這更進一步，則是純粹利用名詞底堆砌而完成其感覺性的詩句，如李商隠隋宮詩「於今　草無螢，終古　楊有暮雅」，用腐草，螢火，　楊，暮雅來醖釀　墟的感覺以過到人事最為無常的感慨。但這些名詞仍不够獨立地應用，較這更進一步，如「　聲，茅店，月；人跡，板結橋，霜」。或「兩行燈下淚，一紙嶺南書」，或「梨花庭院，溶溶月；楊枊池塘，淡淡風」；之類詩句，則純是名詞之具象的排比，在每句都能獨立地發生一種複合的感覺。</p>
<p>陽光　謝紫</p>
<p>一個小孩子生了　病，昏昏沈沈的儘是唾；除了吃藥的時間以外，差不多都是迷朦不醒。這樣過了好幾天，在母親的焦急和自己的昏朦中過了好幾天，燒才退去，覺得清醒了。撇開一通串亂夢，或許也帶着一些夢的餘讀，睜開眼睛，他發現，或者說，記起那是個春天的早晨。太陽帶着氤氳的暖氣，從窗口透進來，這光輝被低　的窗幔反映成藍影；被小　的銅梗鑄成黃金；被母親披在襟上的手帕融成白雪。就在這三種色彩中，他開始注意母親的臉——幾天熬夜，母親有些憔悴了，但這憔悴遮不住她的靑春，更遮不住那種母受的光華。她入彿正在想，想着她的孩子，為什麼老是昏睡，為什麼不快點醒過來……可是猛回頭間，她發現孩子已經醒了，於是一　驚喜的微笑，罩在她臉上，俯下身來，用手撫摸他的額頭，並且問他話，可是這孩子一聲也不響，有些茫然，因為這時候，他心裏，他眼裏，只有一片幸福的陽光！</p>

<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>柯羅連科廿五年死祭</p>
<p>最近蘇聯的報紙上突然刋出一張柯羅連科？（Valimir　Korolenko）的照片，灰色鬍子，高額角，濃厚的頭髪向後梳，帶着仁愛的直透人心的目光。這照片是紀念彁羅連科廿五年死祭的。</p>
<p>莫斯科特為柯羅連舉行了一個嚴肅的紀念會。聽衆包括工人·學生·文學生·藝術家·科學家等。最初由作家戈爾巴朶夫演講。接着比爾齊可夫（Belchikov）敎授講到柯羅連科的生活和作品。演員阿克塞諾夫（Vsvolod　Aksenov）朗育柯羅連科日記的斷片。</p>
<p>柯羅連科的文學遺產彼保存在莫斯科則列寗國家圖需館裏。一九三八年作者的女兒獻出作者的手蹟給圖書館保存。一共收藏了六十八夾，其中有柯羅連科的親筆簽字·原稿·校樣，還有幾本「我同時代的故事」（Story　of　My　Contemporary）的修正稿本。這稿子是他一九〇六年開始寫作。一直寫到他死為止的。還有他那著名的小說「盲樂師」（The　Blind　Musician）的稿本。這本書我國也有張亞權和張聞天的兩種譯文。即在此書出版後，柯羅連科都還有修正。加添新的節段各種的訂正。</p>
<p>在收藏的原稿中，還有一篇不說「怪女郞」（Queer　Girl）這是寫强幹無畏的革命女性的，是他一八八〇年在獄中所寫，曾被沙皇手下所禁。一九〇五年以後方纔第一次出版。</p>
<p>因了這位小說家的死，致使他未能完成他的一本講到蒲加契夫（Emelyan　Pugahev）的書。這書題目呌做「反動的沙皇」（Insurgent　Tsar）手稿也藏在列寗圖書館裏，作者一八七九年到一九〇〇年間的劄記也收藏在這圖書館裏。</p>
<p>凑巧德爾曼（Ibram　Deman）所作的「柯羅連科傳」也已由莫斯科兒童文學出版局刋行了。柯羅連科是革命前　國文　名作家　後一人，又是七年代民主運動的　將，高藏基稱這位老大哥走的是「英雄的艱難的路」。他曾被監禁在維西尼伏羅次克（Vyshnevolotsk）政治犯監半裏和托波爾斯克（Tobolsk）的暗砲台裏。又時常被充到遙遠的地方去。甚至他成名以前，也常被密探跟隨，也常受審問，他雖是一位仁愛而又敏感的人和家，却常是沙皇的敵人。</p>
<p>遠爾曼曾經訪問過柯羅連科多次，對於他知道得很淸楚。像這樣完全而又通俗的傳記，還是他第一個寫。這部書　出他對於柯羅連科兒時和學生時代。</p>
<p>柯羅連科不到二十五歲就與別的學生們一同抗議學校當局帮同軍警搜查「政治上不可信任」的學生，因此第一次被遺戍，時為一八七六年。他最遠的遺戍是一八八一年到史羅波達·阿姆溝（Sloboda　Amgu）去，因為他拒飲忠誠於沙皇亞歷山大三世的祝酒。</p>
<p>達爾曼詳叙柯羅連科在西伯利亞的生活，說他做農夫和補鞋匠，一方面濃用藝術家說利的眼光硏究當地人民的生活。</p>
<p>關於西伯利亞生活的短篇小說集（「瑪加爾的夢」及其他）和「盲樂師」的出版是柯羅邊科一生中的大事。柯羅連科的作品中常說到他對於沙皇的憎恨，在法庭裏他替農民辦護。</p>
<p>達爾曼寫柯羅連科與柴霍甫，高爾基等人的友誼，也很詳細。書中　收有高爾基寫給柯羅連科的幾封信，可看出他對於這位老大哥的崇敬。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉動風</p>
<p>萍子的這句話，却刺傷了鶴見的尊嚴：「一個堂堂男子，竟需要一個女人來保護！」他想着這才恢復了被萍子一陣胡攪，因而失去了的知覺；認出了萍子的車，並不是送他上新綠大廈，却是往效外飛駛着；路燈影下，簡直看不到車，馬，行人。</p>
<p>「你上哪兒去，萍子？」鶴見抬起了一隻手，壓在萍子的玉臂上。</p>
<p>「送您上太淸神社去，大哥！」萍子的口氣，似乎是「理所當然」，而鶴見簡直是多此一問似的。</p>
<p>「不！」鶴見剛睡醒的獅子一般，搖起頭來一吼：「我並不需要上什麼社社……乾脆請你把我放下車去罷，中村，姐！」說着便加重了手臂上的力量，强制着轉動了架駛舵盤；以致車子跨出路綫，幾乎衝上了人行道。</p>
<p>「忍耐一點，大哥！」萍子輕舒皓腕，使了一個解數，把鶴見的手臂掙開，一面把舵盤扶正，車子於是重新上了行駛路綫，一面仍舊冷靜安祥地說：「您要是不相信，請您回身瞧瞧，我們來路上是什麼情形！」萍子雖得有這麼一次，說話不帶笑容。</p>
<p>鶴見這時，十分驚訝起來；他從沒有知道，這麼一位嬌枊弱的萍子，竟有這大腕力；輕輕一揮，竟把自己的手臂震開，力量雖說不猛，却有一股暗勁，無法抗拒的暗勁。可見前次初會，萍子在車中，手指傳訊，要求鶴見傳她柔術的話，簡直是開玩笑。（見第六章）。</p>
<p>第二件呌鶴見警訝的，因他聽見「來路上情形」的話，說得那樣愼重其事，果然回頭，從後面車窗看去；一時忘了尾座上還有人坐着擋住了視綫；當時雖沒看出後背，路上情形，倒是看見車尾上，除了「〇八」野猪之外，另有一個年輕女子坐着。那女子湊巧這時也正低頭在探看車內情形，—也許因為剛才車子幾乎衝上行人道的原故。在强烈的路燈光下，可以看出這女子面孔綳得緊緊地，好像含着怒意。然而却是一位鶴見從未見過的陌生女子。</p>
<p>更叫鶴見驚訝的，因他轉過頭來，探頭窗外，向車後瞧去，竟見這條路上，有一部敞蓬大車，在二百米右距離外，風馳電掣般，遙遙尾追着。車上坐着五六名大漢；因距雖太遠，雖然看不淸眉目，然而瞧那打份，一見就知道是些標準武士道</p>
<p>「嘿，究竟是誰哪？」鶴見自言自語似的喃着。</p>

<h3>说「人生在世」</h3>
<p>— 季庸</p>
<p>最近「觀察」上有吳世昌先生一文，論及近日大中學生作文之濫調，大致起首都是「時代的輪子……」，「自從抗戰以來」等語，恰如二十年前，中學生的開筆就是「人生在世」，「人生兩大之間」，吳氏稱此爲平日心理蓄積的反映云。</p>
<p>細想起來，即使能作這樣滥調，已算好了，因爲到底還有個「調」在。蜜際上今日中學生作文，開口便是「文法的錯誤」，還談得上什麼「格」「調」！有人發牢騷說，也许再這樣下去三十年，中國將沒有人會寫一篇通順的本國文字，此話確否，只好等三十年後再說，目下也無從懸斷，所以便不再杞憂。倒是先談談所謂濫調的由來吧。</p>
<p>說中學生作文濫調，其實是寃枉的，我們該從要人們的講演，談話，招待新聞託者等處看起。即使是業巳定了罪的貪汚犯，他就職時不也曾大聲極呼的喊要减輕人民負担嗎？對於肅淸囤積懲罰奸商取締走私更不得了，幾乎天天在報上可以有佔大量篇幅沒人要看也沒人要信的「高論」，這些試問不是「人生在世」是什麽？看作文的人見了「時代的輪子」固然頭痛，可是還得硬着頭皮往下看，老百姓則不負此種義務，他只是把報紙一拌，或是1拿報紙就翻「社會新聞」，注意張春帆雙槍盜空中結婚等等了。——小型報之發達，正亦爲此。</p>
<p>從前拿八股當敲門磚，門一開，磚就丟了。如今這些新興的八股却不是敲門磚，敲門得另憑別的有效工具，光是磚一定不成。那麼是什麽！原來是廣告，或曰烟幕彈，而北平話則名之曰「賣膏藥」。不過，廣告是「信不信由你，買不買也由你」，這是有充分自由的。八股却是强聒不舍，你不但得接受，而且還得說「頂好」。</p>
<p>一德從風，上有好者不必有甚焉者。偉人們是這般如此的在賣自己的膏藥，學生當然習而不自覺的把時代輸子轉個不停。然而這是將來的偉人呀，到了他們的時代到來，還不是永遠循環不已的賣那萬試萬靈而一點不靈的水膏藥嗎？</p>
<p>嗚呼！「人生在世……」</p>
<h3>與蕭伯納喫茶</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>百老匯舞台監督和演員摩里斯伊凡土（Maurice　Evans），爲了在美國上演蕭伯納的愛情喜劇「人與超人」，不久以前曾親自到英國拜訪蕭，洽談上演稅問題。蕭雖年高九十一，而仍精神奕奕，聲調中充滿力與美。與伊凡士縱談戲劇，演技，以及杜魯門與華萊士。伊几士返美以後，寫了一篇「與蕭翁喫茶記」，登在紐約前鋒論壇報的「本星期雜誌」上。</p>
<p>蕭伯納住在郝福德郡的阿約特聖勞倫斯，他印了一種路程單，專給來訪的客人用的。告訴你自何路離倫敦，經過甚麼地方向北直行，再左轉灣，穿過小路再右轉灣等等，上面寫着自倫敦到蕭宅需時一小時一刻鐘。伊几士手中緊緊地捏着這張單子，左轉右轉，轉得七葷八素，最後費了兩個半多鐘頭，才算到了。若不是看見來開門的那纖小的愛爾籣女僕溫暖的，歡迎的笑容，他幾乎要疑心，這條轉彎未角的路竟是蕭的惡作劇了。</p>
<p>經過蕭的秘書白契小姐傳話以後，他從書房走了出來，滿腮的白鬍子，刺硬如豪豬的毛刺。手中支着一根手杖。蕭的一對眼睛，是更深的凹進去了，但在濃聚的眉毛下，仍閃　着嘲　的光輝。他以往頭髮和鬍　上的紅色素，現在似乎都聚攏到鼻子上了。倒使他有點像他自稱的小丑。他的服裝，也仍舊表現出一種個性，舊的綠呢上裝，長過膝下的扎腿褲。</p>
<p>伊凡士隨了蕭走到客廳去，出乎他的意外，蕭住的這所房子很小，而且有點不大舒服的樣子。客廳中零亂地散放着一些古董和傢具，顯示出它們的主人是太忙了，並且深　奢侈。</p>
<p>愛爾蘭女僕端了茶來，蕭伯納的面前却放了一大杯奇異的飲料。這是一個寒冷，險雨的日子，伊凡士和蕭伯納靠近一座小的活動電爐烤火。從這一點上，正可以看出英國今日情况的艱困；即使如蕭翁這樣的人物，巳僅爲了年齡已高，才獲得特准，使用道樣一個小小的電爐。蕭工作的屋子，從前是燒得很暖然的，可是現在他也只能帶了這個小電爐去取暖，而他總是把電爐那樣靠近自己的身傍，管家婦常要担心那條蓋在他膝上的毯子會燒起來</p>
<p>「你要上演人與超人」，蕭突然地說。伊凡士沒防到這一着，吃了一驚，幾乎把手中的茶杯掉了下來。「好的，你可以演它，但是你得記住——你必須快點上演。這齣戲雖然一直是呌座的，可是我也不願意在總統競選年，在美國上演它。——你知道，競爭太厲害了。」</p>
<p>伊士几乘機問蕭對於一九四八年美國總統競選人的意見。</p>
<p>他說：「這很難說，杜魯門和艾德禮一樣，他們所做的成績，都比當初我們料想的好得多。不過，自從大戰以來，到英國來過的美國人，只有華萊士的談話，還不像村夫那樣平庸。」</p>
<p>伊士几覺得這是蕭想引起1番辯論的戰略，沒有接下去，就言歸正傳，問蕭對於上演稅的意見。</p>
<p>蕭翁坐在椅子上突然顯得緊張起來，帶着愛爾蘭口音說：「每個人都向戲院討大價錢，我五十年來沒有改變過自己的條件•而且它們是不可改變的。」（按：蕭翁所抽的上演稅，爲戲票百分之十五。）</p>
<p>對於上演他的戲，蕭翁發表了一句肯定的意見，他說：「現代的演員怕演我的戲。」</p>
<p>蕭的意思也許是指演員怕念他戲裏的台詞，因為蕭是用有韻的散文寫戲的，差不多就是詩了。</p>
<p>簽了合同以後，蕭光着頭，淋着雨送伊几士出來，充份顯露出這一代文豪的溫情。</p>
<h3>認眞</h3>
<p>— 乃紫</p>
<p>美國某小邑監獄，逃脫于犯，該處警察局長立將那個逃脫之犯所拍不同姿勢　煦相六張，寄與隣邑的警察局長。數小時後，他接着回電說：</p>
<p>「其中五犯已獲，預料歡小時內，第六名亦可就逮。」</p>
<h3>死活之間</h3>
<p>— 介丁</p>
<p>潮惠山莊這幾天鬧出了活人搶死人房子的悲慘局面來，成羣的難民闖進山莊去，把死人靈柩搬開而自己住下，爲數巳在一千人以上。於是有人以爲先人不安而大覺難民們之無理了。</p>
<p>照中國的舊倫理觀念，父母死了兒子要在荒山曠野之中伴着父母的墳「廬墓」三年，排棄一切活人事務來陪伴死人「睡覺」，死人之重於活人如此。就是今天，「父母奄穸未安」也可使兒女寢食不安無以爲「活」人的。一個人出生，父母盡了心把小孩養大就是，也可以把小孩打打罵罵出出自己的氣，對死人（包括自己死了的兒女）却不得有半分褻賣，必恭必敬，挺屍三日，大殮，伴靈哭七，棺木要上好，勘地點穴，破土入墓，以至祭祀冥慶……甚至有爲了喪事破費而傾家蕩產，而活人活不下去的。照這抓重視死人的程度看來，活人搶死人的房子當然是死罪不可恕了。</p>
<p>可是縱使人們這樣看重死人，這個世界還是活人的世界，在南京路上熙熙攘攘奔走寫字間交易所，擺攤告地狀，沿門求乞，都是活人，如果發見一個死人在行動那簡直是翻天覆地的大事了。</p>
<p>看鄕下的土地，尤其是城郊鎭陲，土饅頭佔據的地方極多，在城巿裏，會館山莊的房屋比貧難民却無以為生，露宿街頭，兒啼妻哭慘不忍睹，和死人的安逸比較，眞是莫大諷刺。</p>
<p>爲了活人活得像樣一點——至少也要有一個起碼的生存條件，富人應該把自己過度的奢侈捐棄一點來帮助窮人過活，何况是死人？</p>
<h3>漫話幌子</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>一個鄉間人，一旦突然踏進已然「現代化」的大都市，尤其是京滬等處，其所受新奇的感覺，欲不如劉姥姥之入大觀園那樣，是不可得的。最顯明的，諾如五顏六色的霓虹燈，一字長蛇的待車陣，「大减價」「大犧牲」之類的市招……都使他大有「山陰道上，應接不暇」之概。</p>
<p>尤其那些「大减價」之類的市招，繪着美女而異常誇大的廣告，對於1個鄉下人的引誘力的確是相當之大，也許使他不吝破囊，做上一次或二次三次的所謂　「阿木林」的。但是，「門檻」稍精一點的，就會了然那不過是商人們美麗的謊言，「幌子」而已。因爲，「逐什一之利」，乃是每一個商人的天經地義，誰也不會做「蝕本」賣買，誰也不肯眞的作「不顫血本」那樣「大犧牲」的傻瓜的。所以，打着「大减價」市招的，不過僅是那麼一回事罷了。這樣，「幌子」這一名詞，無形地在一般人的下意識里，也就成爲「製造誑言」的變相了。其實，那是相當寃枉的事情。</p>
<p>「幌子」是什麼？探本求源，誰都知道乃是商人們用以招待顫客，推銷貨物的工具。它的作用，絕不在一味誇大的廣告之下。在古老的時代，它却大多是用不扣不折的實物來標榜的。今天，在一些古老的商鎭或城市，這種以實物作幌子的作風，依然普遍的存在，尤其以北方的城鎭最普遍。可是，即使在已然現代化的大都會，其遣蹟也多少殘餘底存在着。譬如器皿店在門前掛着的實物若壺鍋之類，梳篦店簷前懸着的大木梳，以及鐘錶舖，鞋舖簷前懸掛的木製鐘面，靴圖等都是。這些實物和象徴化「幌子」，在認爲巳經落伍了的人看去，當然非常陳舊；可是，它的作用，仍然是會使顧客一目了然的。它的表面上雖然是默無一言，沒有說謊的廣告那樣來得天花亂墜，然而，它也不會招致受過廣告欺騙的人那麼憎厭！</p>
<p>但是，這種起源於商塲上開始應用的「幌子」，一旦泛濫到商塲以外的角落，也就成爲一種大不幸了。何况「撒誑」之風大盛的今日，「幌子」的妙用乃大大的增加了。又何怪「掛羊頭，賣狗肉」者之滔滔皆是乎？</p>
<h3>如此升官</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>唐穆宗爲太子時，聞李聽有良馬，求之不得，及即帝位，曰：「李聽不與朕馬，正直可知，是以可任。」遂拜爲將軍。明史三楊傳云：「楊溥爲相，其子來自石首，備言所過州縣官迎送饋遺之物，惟江陵知縣范理，頗不爲禮。溥異之，後　知其賢，即　知德安府，再擢貴州布政。或勸理宜致書謝，理曰：宰相爲朝廷用人，非私於理，何謝之有。後聞溥卒，乃祭而哭之，以謝知己。」此等與言得官，皆出於純生，毫無偏私，俱足爲後世法。其尤者，以彼不我與而我偏與之，求之古今中外，實罕有其匹，此所以爲難也，但此稱人生於今日，都有被目爲「　大」的可能。至南史宋　劉盡頤傳略云：「願性卑鄙，但爲孝武帝所狎，帝寵殷貴妃，妃　，旣葬，猶數與羣臣省妃墓，一日顧爲願曰：卿哭貴妃若悲，當加厚賞。　應聲號慟，撫　　踴，涕泗交流！上悅，以爲豫州刺史·」如此升官，眞別開生面！混帳無恥，集於一堂，求其國家太平，人民樂業，眞在做夢呢！</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第四章，　兩心相印　（一六）</p>
<p>這時僕歐己上第三道菜，綺紈一面用小刀，切着　上牛排，一面說道：「我認為女人就好似這牛排一樣，味美好供人宰割，你們男子便是操刀吃肉的人，可以任意選擇。」渚齋微微一笑，把頭搖一搖。綺紈道：「你不贊成我這話嗎？」渚齋道：「你把男人看得太狠了，不知男人也有男人的苦痛。男女結合，最重要的是彼此精神能得安慰，精神能安慰，才能彼此體諒，能體諒，愛情自然日見濃厚。就說我的太太吧，她長的好不好，姑不必提，衹以常識來說，什麼也不懂，腦筋裹祇知油鹽酒醬酷，說起話來俗不可耐，呌我如何能和她合得來。我對她衹有苦痛，精神上得不到一絲安慰。」綺紈笑道：「家裹有這麼賢德管家婆，使你無內顧之憂，你還不滿意嗎？」渚齋道：「這是五十年前的見解，不合時代性了。」綺紈聽了，向渚　　了一眼道：「俗語說巧婦常伴拙夫眠，你不是拙夫，她也不是巧婦，正好相反了」說着吃吃的笑起來，渚齋也不由陪她笑了。綺紈又道：「我剛才所說的，都是落伍的話，請你不要見怪！」渚齋道：「我才希望你不要見怪呢，我那位太太，昨晚在台下，不知輕重，隨口胡說八道，想小王媽一定當做笑話都告　你了，眞是沒辦法！」綺紈把兩眼一睜，現出很奇異的神色，說道：「你這話怎麼講？那能怪你—她知道我和你是什麼關係呀？」綺紈說了這一句，立覺這話太過分了，粉臉陡的一紅，一個頭低下去，低得幾乎到盤面上，輕輕一笑。渚　見她天眞的憨態，又聽她這樣甜蜜蜜的話，心花怒放，當時祗礙着僕歐送咖啡進來，不然眞要五體投地，感謝美人慧眼埀靑。一時吃過咖啡，綺紈道：「今天談話，覺得很痛快，現在時問還早，我們到那裹散步散步。」渚齋道：「這裘離中南海公園最近，要否我們到公園走走。」綺紈道：「那也好，中南海公園比較淸靜，我好久沒去了。」渚齋急要會賬，綺紈道：「你忙什麽？我已經付過了。」僕歐送上賬單，附上剩餘零錢，綺紈全賞給他，僕歐連連稱謝，代僱了車，二人同到中南海公園。這時已夕陽啣山，殘照漸匿，公園中暮靄四合，零落地幾盞電燈，微風過處，太液池中，立起幾道縐紋。沿岸疎林，蕭蕭飄下黃葉，打在二人身上。渚齋在綺紈臂上一撫道：「你衣服穿得這麼少，冷嗎？」</p>

<p>讀過「女兵十年」的人，都知道冰瑩是一位女英雄，英雄是豪邁的，但我以爲越是豪邁的英雄，會越感到寂寞。她說道：「像負重的駱駝，疲勞地在無休止的前進。」險戲的世路，滄桑的人事，生之煎迫使她變得寂寞了。她也說過：「想再到溫和的江南來，」但直到現在她還沒有來。是的，江南的天氣算溫和些，然而，在世路人事上，却是終年的酷寒呢！</p>
<h3>幸福家庭</h3>
<p>— 羅塔</p>
<p>「幸福的家庭都相似，不幸的家庭各有各的不幸」，這是托翁的安娜·卡倫妮娜一書中的第一句話。</p>
<p>那麽幸福的家庭是啥樣子呢？由於每日報紙裏的牛奶粉，魚肝油，絨毛綫，絲襪……的巨幅廣告的暗示再加上自己的幻想，構成了這麼一幀幸福的美滿家庭的圖畫：</p>
<p>季節最好在嚴冬，時間以晚上爲妙，因爲只有冬夜最易顯出一家的幸與不幸。</p>
<p>在一間收拾得十分整齊淸潔的房子裘的火爐前的兩張沙發椅中坐着爸爸和媽媽，爸爸斜靠在椅背上正出神看着當天晚報，媽媽則正襟危坐，很小心捲着一顆準備打背心或手套的絨綫球。她的前面站了一個十二三歲的姊姊，一大圈絨綫就套在這個女孩子張開的兩手中，只要看手間絨錢下埀的曲度，可知她也像普天下女孩子那樣的聰明，知道手要放鬆些，好讓一圈一圈的絨綫脫出，如果換了一個同年的男孩子就不行了，他必出死力把綫張得緊綳綳的，如提琴弦，或者如兩根電竿中的無數電綫。當然，在姊姊的背後有個比她少不了一兩歲的弟弟，他什麽都不會，只曉得騎在木馬上搖呀搖的。</p>
<p>門口有個三十開外的娘姨，正捧着牛奶，咖啡，或可可進來（這要看是誰家的廣告了），這個娘姨雖無傾城段國之貌，然而五官端正，眉目淸秀，衣服雖然算不得考究，但是從頭到脚都十分整潔。</p>
<p>這就是千篇一律幸福家庭的圖畫了。雖然有時這得稍嫌呆板，俗氣，然而它畢竟是幸福的，可羡慕的，我也極願意參加進去</p>
<p>但是，我希望這幀圖畫就這樣，千萬別動，一動可就糟了。不必說什麽原子彈落下，股票暴跌，銀行倒閉，都可以反這畫澈底破壞，只要那位坐着看報的爸爸不知怎的突然心血來潮，放下報紙，向進來的娘姨瞟了一眼或扮一個鬼臉，不巧給媽媽瞧見了，一手摔下絨綫球，直撲過去，衝得姊姊弟弟人仰馬翻，娘姨手裏的牛奶。咖啡　得滿身滿地………</p>
<p>你看，祇要這麽一來，一家的幸福就完了！「幸福的家庭都相似，不幸的家庭各有各的不幸。」這是一幅千篇一律的幸福家庭的圖畫的結束，一篇描寫無數種不幸家庭中的一種的小說的開端。</p>
<p>而「奧布浪斯家裘的一切混亂了，妻子發覺了丈夫……」也正是托爾斯泰小說的開頭。</p>
<h3>除舊更新</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>這一天說得高興，老張，老王，小孫連我1共四個人，從辦公室出來，一直到正興館去大嚼。臨行之前，我細細把卓上的東西收拾，應該放在身邊的東西，如小刀，自來水筆，錢夾，打火機等都放在袋裹，穿好大衣，從容出去。五時半以後的馬路上，擠滿了歸心如箭的一羣人流，我們在人叢中東竄西突，好容易穿過河南路，到達正興館。正興館漸漸地知道從淸潔入手了。從前來是油汚的桌子，默黑不堪的毛竹筷，屋顧欲落的房子……這一會去面目全非，佈置得乾乾淨凈。屋頂已經粉刷一淸，加上雪白的泥幔頂，日光燈代替了電燈，桌子上舖了雪白的檯布，毛竹筷早已屏除，改用假象牙筷。據說這種陳館子，光顧的常是一批特客以不得不勉求改進。</p>
<p>我們在酒醉飯飽之後同出來，又是安步當車的回轉寓所。坐定之後，正是想拿出筆來寫些什麼的時侯，對不起，方才一枝安放妥貼的自來水筆業告失蹤，就是摸穿所有身上的袋底，也找不出來。細細一想，一定是方才混亂人叢中被身手矯捷的摸竊黨拿去了。除了怪自己的不留神和那廝的手段高明以外，還有何說。一枝追隨了我有十年歷史的老派克，就這樣和他分離，　惱以外，還有神傷的成份。</p>
<p>不得已另外去買了一枝新的，仍屬「老派」，幸喜新筆之流利，勝於前筆。我欣然以革命者自居，「沒有破壞，何以建設」。現在我的筆被壞了。但總算另行「建設」了一枝新筆，自以為在這樣阮　羞澀的時候，居然有除舊佈新的精神，略有上海所謂「脫底」的作風，但究竟覺得自己選有「革命精神」，不禁沾沾自喜。惟毛病出在上館子　所謂「不家食吉」的古語，此刻應該撕破了。</p>

<h3>U.S. Congress Approves Foreign Aid Bill, House Appropriations Committee Reduces Amount, Marshall to Expedite Aid to China</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Agency Report, Washington, 15th] Congress has completed the approval of $597 million for temporary aid to Austria, China, France, and Italy. The approved bill now only awaits President Truman's signature, so that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation can prepay $150 million to the State Department to assist the aided countries. House Majority Leader Halleck said that the Appropriations Committee will present the appropriations bill on Tuesday for debate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges said on the 15th that he would again hear General Wedemeyer's arguments regarding aid to China on the 17th, but it is not yet certain whether the committee will accept Wedemeyer's long-term China survey report. At the same time, the committee will hear arguments from Bullitt, Chou I-te, and Mrs. Luce, chairman of the American China Policy Association, as well as other State Department officials. According to Bridges, the committee will request a statement from the State Department regarding its China aid policy before deciding whether to recommend an emergency fund for aid to China. [This newspaper's report] New York, 16th, broadcast: Washington report, the House Appropriations Committee has submitted a bill to the House that reduces the foreign aid funds approved by Congress by $88 million and the funds requested by the Army Department for overseas occupied areas by more than $260 million. The committee also proposed a supplementary appropriations bill, which stipulates two points: $500.9 million for emergency aid, which is 15% less than the relief funds approved by Congress on the 15th for France, Italy, Austria, and China; and $230 million for the U.S. military occupied areas of Germany, Japan, Korea, and Austria, which is a reduction of slightly less than 53% from the $490 million originally proposed by the Army Department. The committee expressed doubt about the soundness of the overseas relief plan. The appropriations committee did not stipulate funds for aid to China in the proposed bill, although this aid has been approved by Congress and is currently awaiting President Truman's signature. The committee believes that it is not appropriate to allocate funds to China because there is no plan for aid to China. The committee also doubts whether aid to France, Italy, and Austria can produce concrete results. Of the $88 million reduced by the appropriations committee, $66 million was reduced from aid to France and $22 million from aid to Austria.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] New York, 16th, broadcast: Washington report, General Clay expressed his opinion in the Appropriations Committee today, considering it inappropriate for the committee to greatly reduce the U.S. Army's requested funds for overseas occupation, as these funds are necessary to maintain order and stability in the overseas occupied areas. [Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] Officials here believe that after the London Conference is deadlocked, Marshall will expedite the China aid plan when he returns to Washington on the 19th. [Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] U.S. Senator Vandenberg said in the Senate that, given the meager amount of aid China has received to date, China "has full right to enjoy" U.S. aid. Vandenberg also told the Senate that his views and "the U.S. official stance on China are difficult to reconcile." He continued that he had repeatedly requested that a "different attitude" be adopted towards China, but he did not specify his policies. Vandenberg said that if senators on the joint committee insisted on deleting the China aid portion from the aid package passed by the House, this would be a "double prejudice" on the Senate side, which might cause a "misunderstanding of our basic attitude towards China." He reiterated that the door to China has been opened, and that some senators on the joint committee are unwilling to close the door. Senator Connally, a prominent Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pointed out that Marshall will soon submit a China aid plan to Congress. He claimed that the $18 million under the relief fund that has not yet been allocated after the end of the UNRRA, plus $30 million under the relief plan, can help China get through the end of this year. According to news reports, it is expected that Congress will pass the appropriations bill before adjourning on the 19th.</p>

Regarding the issue of strengthening local armed forces, Fu believes that it is very important, and pointed out that mobilizing the masses requires "unity of people's strength" rather than "organizing the masses," because "organizing the masses" is based on the government's requirements, and uniting people's strength is based on the people's wishes.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Zhengzhou, 16th] The advance troops of Chen Yi's bandit army, numbering more than 10,000, who disrupted the Zheng-Bian-Xu triangle area, have been attacked from both east and west by the elite National Army, cut into two sections, and isolated from each other, making it easy to annihilate them. After being repelled, the bandits who disturbed Xin Zheng are now attacking the county seat again, and a fierce battle is underway. [This newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The remnants of the 11th Column of Chen Yi's bandit army, which had fled from western Shandong to the Bian-dong Minfeng Station, have been defeated by the National Army. The remnants of the bandits fled towards Tongxu. The National Army not only sent a part to clear out the scattered bandits near Erfeng, but also sent a team to continue the pursuit and suppression. On the 15th, a unit of the National Army in eastern Henan fought fiercely with the remnants of the 8th Column of Chen Yi's bandits, who had fled south from western Shandong near Suixian, killing more than 2,000 officers and soldiers, including Zhou Changsheng, commander of the 24th Division of the bandits, and seizing a large number of spoils of war. The remnants of the bandits fled northwest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 16th] The battle to defend Lanfeng has reached its most intense stage by noon on the 16th. Because the communist bandits were frustrated in their attack, they repeatedly sent reinforcements, reaching a total of 20,000. Taking advantage of the dusty weather and the cold wind, they repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the city. Our defending troops used intense firepower to stop them. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, especially the fight for the station and the South Pass, which was even more tragic. More than 1,000 bandit corpses could be seen at the station in the suburbs of the city, and many of our soldiers outside the city also perished with their positions, which can be described as heroic. [Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th] The National Army held on to Xuchang with extraordinary courage and determination, causing a regiment of Chen Yi's bandits who had launched a fierce attack in the past two days to suffer setbacks without success. At the moment, although the bandits are using field artillery to bombard the west and south passes, the defending army is also returning fire with fierce artillery fire, so the bandits still cannot get close to the city walls.</p>
<h3>There Is No Fighting Near Xinyang, the Fighting in the Dabie Mountains Has Subsided Slightly Due to Continuous Rain and Snow, Interview with Xu Zuyi, Chief of Staff of the Jiujiang Command Headquarters</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hankou, 16th] General Xu Zuyi, Chief of Staff of the Jiujiang Command Headquarters, met with the reporter from this newspaper on behalf of Minister Bai at 3:00 pm today and said: Due to the continuous rain and snow, the communist bandits took the opportunity to escape, causing the bandit suppression military operations in the Dabie Mountain area to subside slightly. At the moment, the 1st, 3rd, and 6th Columns of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops are passing through Guangshan Beiqiao, and their advance troops have crossed the Huai River. As for the local communist troops under Li Xiannian and Huo Erzhu, numbering about 20,000, they have crossed west of the Pinghan Railway and are constantly disrupting the transportation line. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing them according to the three principles of "pursuit", "strangulation", and "repression". When asked about the traffic situation on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, Xu replied: The destroyed tracks south of Xinyang have been repaired. A batch of prisoners who came from that area recently will arrive in Wuhan within a few days. Rumors that fighting has occurred near Xinyang have been refuted. Finally, Xu had a "chat by the stove" with the reporter for about half an hour, appearing quite relaxed amidst his busy schedule. Also, Minister Bai spent the whole day today at his official residence handling important official business and meeting with Vice Director Sun Weiru of the headquarters.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji's Remains to be Encoffined Tomorrow; Chairman Sends Wu Siyu as Representative to Offer Condolences</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhang Ji, a member of the government committee and Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, passed away due to illness at his residence at midnight on the 15th. Upon hearing the news on the morning of the 16th, various parties went to offer condolences. Zhang's remains were washed and injected with preservatives before noon. In the afternoon, at 6:00 PM, the remains were moved from his residence to the Compilation Committee of Party History Materials of the Kuomintang. At 4:15 PM, the hearse and his family arrived at the committee. As the remains were moved out of the hearse and covered with the party flag, mournful music began to play, and snow fell, as if heaven and earth were mourning together. Soon after the memorial hall was arranged and filled with incense, this founding figure of the party and nation closed his eyes and passed away. Accompanying the remains were his two eldest daughters, both dressed in mourning clothes, weeping incessantly amidst the mournful music. Zhang was dressed in a black robe and mandarin jacket, his face still lifelike. Dai Chuanxian and Zhang Lisheng, members of the Central Executive Committee and the Control Yuan, were among the first to pay their respects, with Ding Weifen officiating. In addition to sending floral wreaths and sacrificial offerings, Chairman Jiang specifically sent Director Wu Siyu as his representative to offer condolences and express his sympathies to Zhang's two daughters. Duan Jianmin also went to offer condolences, immediately kneeling and wailing loudly upon entering the hall, filling the room with sorrow, which moved those who heard it to tears. Zhang's remains are scheduled to be encoffined at 11:00 AM on the 18th. His wife, Madam Cui Zhenhua, is currently in Peiping and a special plane has been arranged to bring her here.

<h3>Trade Policy Toward Japan Aims to Encourage Exports; Spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs Speaks</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated: "The trade policy toward Japan remains based on the principle of benefiting our national economy. The focus is on encouraging exports. Imports will be limited to goods that cannot be produced domestically and are urgently needed. The method will be barter trade, seeking a balance between imports and exports. The trade plans of all commercial representatives going to Japan have been strictly reviewed by the Trade Guidance Committee for Japan. Exportable goods, excluding those prohibited by import and export regulations, will be limited to the range of goods stipulated in the Outline for the Implementation of Measures for Organizing Business Representatives to Japan. All import and export goods not listed in the outline will not be allowed for import or export."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Preventing Speculative Capital from Wreaking Havoc Requires Currency Reform</h3>
<p>When liquid capital cannot find legitimate outlets or destinations, it collectively transforms into speculative capital. Excessive speculative capital, unable to find application, rushes en masse into speculative markets, fueling a frenzy of hoarding and speculation. Moreover, the high profits, reduced expenses, and simple procedures of hoarding and speculation cause existing production capital to transform into speculative capital, vying to flow into speculative markets. Consequently, speculative capital increases, speculation intensifies, prices soar, production shrinks, and the economy becomes chaotic. The primary enemy of the entire national economy now can be said to be the so-called speculative capital.</p>
<p>As early as the Anti-Japanese War, the topic of how to channel or absorb speculative capital had taxed the brains of many. Since the promulgation of emergency economic measures and economic reform plans, all parties have given increasing importance to this issue and have adopted many countermeasures. However, the results have been extremely limited. On the contrary, the power of speculative capital to wreak havoc seems to be increasing daily. What exactly is the reason for this? Now, let us examine various possible preventative measures separately as a reference for learning from past mistakes.</p>
<p>Tightening credit has been implemented repeatedly in the past and is currently being intensified. Measures such as halting loans, blocking remittances, and strengthening the inspection of financial institutions are unprecedented in their stringency and thoroughness. The temporary effect it can produce is certainly not to be dismissed. However, given the various needs of the nation, after financial institutions make adjustments, the tightening of credit cannot but be relaxed gradually. In addition, the legitimate uses of industry and commerce, and the inter-port flow of goods, mean that all loans and remittances cannot be uniformly and permanently halted, as this would hinder the vitality of the economy. Leaving aside other considerations, as the end of the year approaches, various industries are clamoring for so-called year-end bonuses. This expenditure often requires billions or even hundreds of billions for larger companies and factories. If we blindly prohibit it without providing financial assistance, how can the business community overcome this difficulty? Therefore, tightening credit can only be said to be a temporary, palliative measure that cannot fundamentally solve the problem of speculative capital.</p>
<p>Selling off goods, releasing state-owned goods to collect legal tender from the market, is a more practical method. The question is whether the legal tender, once returned, can be held and not released again! How much goods are being sold? Can they be sold continuously? Looking at the past example of selling gold, this policy has clearly failed.</p>
<p>Issuing public bonds is originally a legitimate way for the government to absorb speculative capital. Unfortunately, in the context of declining currency value and excessively low-interest rates, people do not feel interested. The performance of the issuance of US Treasury bonds is a good example.</p>
<p>Encouraging savings faces the same reasons for its ineffectiveness as the above. Now that the interest rate on bank deposits has been decided not to be increased, this avenue can be said to be blocked.</p>
<p>Selling state-owned enterprises is also the most ideal outlet. Unfortunately, the method of sale has been delayed in resolution. Based on the already announced plans to sell state-owned enterprises through the issuance of stocks and the organization of bank syndicates, the better parts are mostly reserved, and future management rights are clearly in the hands of state institutions and official shares. How much interest the general capitalists will have in this is a major question.</p>
<p>Banning private lending is banning underground banks and commercial firm deposits. Commercial firm deposits are a customary practice among the people. When institutional deposit rates are too low and institutional lending is strictly limited, it is an unworkable method unless there is an intention to completely stifle industry and commerce. Moreover, smaller towns in the interior simply do not have banks. If commercial firms are truly forbidden from accepting deposits, where are these deposits supposed to go? Where will these commercial firms go for financing? As for underground banks, as illegal organizations, they should be banned. However, even after completely eradicating them, this only blocks one avenue for speculative capital to operate, while still failing to absorb speculative capital.</p>
<p>Introducing specialized production is a goal everyone eagerly anticipates. In reality, people seek profit as water flows downhill. As long as there is profit to be made, why would they need the government to guide them before engaging in production? It is simply that the current production environment is too bad, and there are too many intentional or unintentional obstacles to production from all sides. The government's empty words of encouragement are far less powerful than the actual obstacles encountered. Established production enterprises are still struggling to extricate themselves, or suffering from the inability to do so. Who would avoid the easy and seek the difficult, inviting trouble for themselves? Therefore, this approach ultimately remains just a nice-sounding phrase.</p>
<p>Raising the standard of living, that is, increasing people's consumption to reduce private speculative capital, is clearly an avenue that our country cannot take at present. This is because there is a severe shortage of goods, and the government is promoting frugality and expanding rationing to limit waste. There are also too many poor people and refugees in various places. These people simply have no capital to spare and urgently need assistance from all sides to survive. How can they increase their consumption!</p>
<p>Increasing income tax is also a dead end. This is because the current tax burden on the people is already too heavy. I have heard one industrialist complain that these two taxes alone already take away more than 70% of their profits, not including other various taxes and levies. Furthermore, property tax, business tax, license plate tax, business license tax, and entertainment tax have recently been increased or are being discussed for increase. How can we blindly kill the chicken to get the eggs, further increasing the burden on the general public? The wealth distribution in society is currently too unequal, and a general income tax system has not been established. The burden of many taxes is ultimately shifted to the middle and lower classes. Therefore, it is inappropriate and practically impossible to use increased taxes to recover speculative capital at present.</p>
<p>Raising the price of daily necessities would be equivalent to increasing taxes, and is, of course, also inappropriate. Moreover, we are currently striving to suppress prices to stabilize people's livelihoods, and there is no possibility of taking the opposite path. Even if it were possible, only in countries with comprehensive rationing or totalitarian politics could the pricing of daily necessities be completely controlled by the state. This is unrealistic for our country at present.</p>
<p>The above measures have either been implemented with little effect, or have yet to be tested, or have been partially implemented in practice even if not tried on the surface, but all fail to alleviate the rampant spread of speculative capital. Therefore, if we truly want to channel or absorb speculative capital, we must devise alternative strategies. We believe that the most practical and effective approach is still to start with currency reform to stabilize the currency value.</p>
<p>If the currency value can be stabilized, then prices will naturally stabilize as well, and the wind of speculation and hoarding will subside without the need for strict prohibition. The increase in savings, the issuance of public bonds, and the decline of underground banks are all inevitable consequences. Therefore, the recent proposals for currency reform should be the only way to solve the problem of speculative capital. If loans are successfully secured and there is a fund, we should seize the opportunity and implement it decisively, without letting it slip away again. This is because the problem of speculative capital is the entire national economic problem. Other aspects such as production, construction, transportation, etc., are just parts of it. Without economic stability, all construction is out of the question. The distinction between fundamental and superficial priorities must be clearly recognized. If we let go of opportunities for reform, and wait until we reach the stage of the Mark, Ruble, or Coruna, and then exchange them at a massive discount, no matter how appealing the stated reasons are, the losses suffered by the people will be too great. The Soviet Union has implemented currency reform to curb inflation. The new Ruble began circulating yesterday. Their method of currency reform is worth our reference.</p>
<h3>Chu Xichun's Talk</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] After the Executive Yuan approved Chu Xichun as the Chairman of Hebei Province, Chu met with reporters, saying: "I have spent half my life in the military. It is a great honor to have the opportunity to serve my hometown at this time. Although we are in a period of turmoil, all policies in Hebei in the future will be aligned with military needs. In the future, Hebei will especially focus on organizing and training the people and winning over young people. Baoding is of great importance to the relationship between Peiping and Tianjin, and it must be defended. Based on my experience in defending Datong, Baoding, apart from needing more troops, will not be difficult to defend. The Hebei Provincial Government will still be located there." Chu is currently busy in Peiping deploying the lineup of the provincial government and will fly to Pan on the 18th to hand over.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chu Xichun is busy in Peiping today with personnel evaluations and visiting respected local figures in Hebei. It is rumored that the authorities intend to appoint Zhang Bojin, the current Deputy Mayor of Peiping, as the Director of Education, and Zheng Daoru as the Director of Finance.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Hebei Provincial Association held a board of directors meeting today. Zhang Yinwu proposed that four representatives should be sent to meet the newly appointed Chairman of Hebei, Chu Xichun, to suggest two points: 1. To be cautious about personnel matters. 2. To adopt key policies to adapt to the current extraordinary situation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Baoding, 16th] The Hebei administrative center has moved back to Baoding. Most of the provincial government personnel who remained in Peiping have returned south. Bunkers line the route between Peiping and Baoding, and heavily armed troops guard the line, with cavalry units searching the railway sides day and night to eliminate bandits.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits and the Soviet Union Sign Military Alliance, It is Said</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1)</p>
<p>The CCP has agreed to allow the Soviet Union priority rights to exploit mineral deposits and agreed to establish a "Sino-Soviet Trade Company" to exclude American influence in China. The Soviet Union has the right to temporarily station troops in Xinjiang and Northeast China. In the event of war, Xinjiang, Northeast China, northern Japan, northern Korea, and Inner Mongolia will be designated as the Far East theater of war, with the Soviet Red Army in charge of the supreme command. The CCP will be the deputy commander-in-chief and concurrently the commander-in-chief of the China theater. To establish a CCP air force, possibly incorporating it into the Sino-Soviet joint air force. The CCP is responsible for providing news related to China, the expansion of the CCP organization, and the Far East China Intelligence Bureau. If war breaks out in the Balkans and the Middle East, the CCP will send an expeditionary force of 100,000 to 200,000 troops and provide a workforce of one million people.</p>
<p>[United Press, This City] Well-informed sources have no knowledge of the mutual assistance agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the CCP, as reported by the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Daily. They said: "There is no way to immediately verify whether this news is accurate."</p>

<p>MacArthur States Japan Cannot Re-arm</p>
<p>American officials in Washington and Tokyo are now hopeful about Sino-American cooperation in resolving the Japanese peace treaty. MacArthur personally hopes that China can recognize Japan as a part of Asia and that friendly relations must be maintained for the benefit of both countries. MacArthur also stated: "Japan will never again become a military power, threatening world peace. Japan has been completely disarmed, and the future peace treaty must include provisions to prevent Japan from ever re-arming. What is needed now is cooperation among Asian countries to strive for friendship and prosperity."</p>
<p>America Needs Greater Ryukyu, No Ambition for Taiwan</p>
<p>Regarding the future status of the Greater Ryukyu Islands, Van believes that "diplomatic circles all believe that this island will be transferred to American administration under the United Nations trusteeship system, as the peace of the Western Pacific relies on American strength and requires the Greater Ryukyu Islands as a base." As for Taiwan, everyone agrees that the Cairo Conference's official statement specifies that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and all Americans believe that Taiwan is currently and will continue to be a part of Chinese territory. The vast majority of the people of Taiwan belong to the Chinese race.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Cannot Build Atomic Bomb in Five Years</p>
<p>Van admits to the tense situation between the United States and the Soviet Union, but it will not lead to war. He said: "There is no risk of a large-scale war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The main reason is that the Soviet Union currently lacks the necessary weapons. The Soviet Union may have theoretically learned how to make the atomic bomb, but it cannot actually engage in manufacturing until it can build the necessary large power plants, and this will take at least five to ten years. At the same time, the Soviet Union has no navy worth mentioning, and the Russians know that historically no one has ever won a major war without acquiring sea power. In addition, the Soviet Union lacks the industrial manufacturing capacity to produce large quantities of airplanes, automobiles, and the thousands of supplies needed for modern warfare. Therefore, all first-class experts believe that there will be no war between the United States and the Soviet Union for at least ten years."</p>
<h3>Central Executive Committee Passes Resolution to Organize Funeral Committee</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Central Government deeply mourns the passing of Mr. Zhang Puquan, a member of the National Government Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Central Supervisory Committee. The Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a special meeting on the morning of the 16th to discuss funeral arrangements. Chairman Yu Youren, while reporting on the details of Zhang's death, broke down in tears, and the entire meeting was filled with grief. In addition to requesting that the National Government issue an order to organize a funeral committee, it was also resolved that all standing committee members of the party's Executive and Supervisory Committees would participate as members of the funeral committee, with Yu Youren, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu serving as chairmen. Yu Zai, Xu Renru, Di Ying, Hong Lanyou, Wang Qijiang, Xu Jingzhi, Han Zhensheng, and Zhang Qingyuan were appointed as executive secretaries of the funeral committee to prepare for the funeral immediately.

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Criticizes Government, Chinese Embassy in US Expresses Dismay</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] The Chinese Embassy today issued a statement regarding Feng Yuxiang's criticism of Chairman Chiang and the Nanjing government, saying: "The Chinese Embassy is deeply dismayed to hear that Feng Yuxiang has issued a main article criticizing Chairman Chiang and the National Government, and opposing American aid to China. Feng, as an official of the government he criticizes, receives his official salary and has all his travel and inspection expenses in the United States provided by the government. Feng's claim that the Nanjing government has at least 200 propagandists stationed in the United States working solely to obtain loans and other aid is completely untrue. To the best of the Embassy's knowledge, there are no such propagandists in the United States."</p>
<h3>Draft Measures for Importing Raw Materials for Export Products Completed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Many of our country's export products require foreign raw materials. Since the government controlled imports, the limited import of raw materials has meant that products are only used domestically, greatly affecting exports. In order to solve this difficulty, the Export-Import Management Committee has drafted measures for importing raw materials for the manufacture of exportable goods, aiming to expand exports and earn foreign exchange. The draft was passed by the committee's fifth meeting. After the measures are implemented, various industries such as handicraft and light industry products such as straw hats, cotton fabrics, embroidery, enameled utensils, and thermos bottles can use these measures to import raw materials, process them, and export them for sale abroad. The government can use the current small foreign exchange expenditure to earn more foreign exchange income in the near future, and related agricultural and industrial producers can also use this to revive and prosper, benefiting both national economy and people's livelihood. The measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan, and the Yuan has convened relevant agencies to review them, making appropriate revisions to the original measures and ordering the Export Management Committee to announce and implement them, and submitting them to the National Government for record. A report was made at the 34th meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Inland China and Xinjiang Exchange Goods</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The exchange of goods between inland China and Xinjiang has now begun.

<h3>Meeting for Three Weeks Without Achievement: Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Breaks Down; U.S. and France Discuss West German Economic Merger; Molotov Hastily Flew Back to Moscow with Entourage Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: High-ranking sources with good connections in diplomatic circles stated that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall will hold a meeting with French Foreign Minister Bidault tonight to discuss the issue of the economic merger of West Germany. Marshall may present Bidault with a merger plan as a result of the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Bidault held a press conference today stating that in the near future, the U.K., U.S., and France will discuss ways to address the issue of West Germany and that a solution must be found. The U.S. delegation held a special meeting today to discuss the various issues arising from the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. Molotov and his entourage have left the U.K. today to return to their country. According to U.S. sources, the Four Foreign Ministers' representatives are scheduled to hold a meeting tomorrow to make a final effort on the Austrian treaty issue.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: French Foreign Minister Bidault held a press conference today, saying that the U.K., U.S., and France forming a West German government has not been considered, but hinted that the economic merger of the three occupation zones will generally be proposed. The U.S. delegation believes that the economic merger of West Germany is a necessary move, and then from economic unity, seek political unity.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: Berlin News, it is certain that Molotov has arrived in Berlin, and due to the inclement weather, he will probably spend the night in Berlin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Marshall, because the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in London was unsuccessful, will fly back to the country on Thursday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, due to the opposition of the U.K., U.S., and France to the Soviet Union's request to extract German production as compensation, apparently had no possibility of breaking the deadlock, and in the meeting on the 15th, at Marshall's suggestion, the conference was declared adjourned indefinitely. At the beginning of today's meeting, Molotov, in order to divert attention from the issue of compensation, requested that the other three foreign ministers agree to discuss the "German People's Congress" request that the Foreign Ministers' Conference allow them to listen to the opinions of the German delegation. The U.K., U.S., and France all stated that this request could not be accepted, so Marshall suggested resuming the discussion of the compensation issue. Marshall said: Regarding the compensation issue, we have obviously fallen into basic disagreements. The Soviet Union's demand for compensation of 10 billion yuan, calculated at 1938 prices, would reach 15 billion yuan at current prices, which is obviously contrary to the Potsdam Agreement and impossible in terms of practical economic principles. Under these demands, an agreement can only be reached if we agree to enslave the German people and seriously obstruct the recovery of the entire Europe. Regarding the Austrian treaty, it also failed to reach an agreement because the property rights and privileges required by the Soviet Union far exceeded what a free and independent Austria could fulfill. The Soviet Union has consistently refused to provide important and necessary information on the costs of transporting German reparations and has refused to agree to hand over German property unilaterally seized in the name of reparations. The Soviet Union's actions prevent Germany from playing its role in the task of rebuilding Europe and force the U.K. and the U.S. to heavily subsidize West Germany to maintain its survival. Unexpectedly, the Soviet representative accused the U.K. and the U.S. of attempting to use West Germany as a strategic base against European national unity and to promote expansionist policies. It should be known that if we stop this aid, the 400,000 Germans in the British and American zones will inevitably face collective starvation. In short, since the Soviet Union has unilaterally and firmly refused to agree, it would be futile and unprofitable to continue meetings to discuss other points. I advocate indefinite postponement of discussion. Bevin, after restating the United Kingdom's position in detail, also said, "History will be our witness. We must now doubt whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference can solve the problems of Europe and Germany after a long time." Molotov stated after Marshall's proposal for an indefinite postponement that Bevin Marshall's actions were obviously the same, both failed to invite the agenda, and both ignored the Soviet Union's suggestions, and the French delegation never objected to what the U.K. and the U.S. said, indicating that the U.K., U.S., and France had adopted a unified front to oppose reparations to the Soviet Union. Regarding the postponement proposal, this is another unilateral action. If the three delegations agree to an indefinite postponement, the Soviet Union will of course have to agree. However, the responsibility for this matter rests entirely with the other three delegations and has nothing to do with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>East and West Present a Divided Situation: Germany Becomes the Forefront of Diplomatic War; West German Federal Plan May Be Realized</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] The breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has divided Germany, Europe, and the world into two halves. Of course, the failure of the conference did not completely shatter the ideal of "one world" during the war. However, the representatives of the Western countries unanimously believed that the relationship between the East and the West had deteriorated to the point where it could not be restored in the short term. Representatives of all countries were unwilling to predict what impact the failure of the conference would have on the world. It is questionable whether the four foreign ministers will be able to meet again. The divided Germany has become the "forefront of diplomatic war".</p>
<p>It is believed that although the U.K., U.S., and France may not take immediate action, the failure of the four foreign ministers to reach any agreement will inevitably lead to the following developments: France is expected to agree to unify its German occupation zone with the already merged British and American zones for economic purposes. The U.K., U.S., and France will accelerate discussions on politically unifying West Germany, which may lead to the establishment of a provisional West German government. The U.S., especially the U.S. Congress, will suddenly increase its support for the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, 16th] An American observer predicted today that West Germany will soon begin to establish a provisional state or federation, which is a direct consequence of the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. German political leaders in the British and American zones have begun preparations to promote its realization. Representatives of the two major political parties in West Germany, the right-wing Christian Democratic Party and the left-wing Social Democratic Party, met here today to draft a concrete plan for organizing the government. It is expected that the task will be decided accordingly. According to a senior official of the Christian Democratic Party, as a result of the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, we have no choice but to proceed in this direction. The economic crisis in West Germany is important to relations in Western Europe, and our unity is necessary. Observers believe that the people of the British and American zones of Germany will be ordered to establish an inter-zonal economic conference, and the governors of the eight states are expected to submit a plan for the unification of West Germany to organize a limited central government.</p>
<h3>Saar Parliament Approves Agreement with France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] The Saar Parliament unanimously passed all the terms of the agreement established with France on the 15th. Only one Communist member voted against it.</p>
<h3>International Committee Established in Paris: Actively Promoting the European Unity Movement; Members Include British, French, Dutch, and Belgian Nationalities</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] Four organizations promoting the European unity movement have formed the "International Committee of the European Unity Movement" to unify the steps of each organization in promoting the movement. The four organizations are the "French Committee for a United Europe" led by French Radical Party leader and National Assembly Speaker Herriot, the "United Europe Movement" led by British Conservative Party leader Churchill, the "European Cooperation and Independence League" led by former Belgian Prime Minister van Zeeland, and the "European Federalist Movement League" led by Brugmans. The International Committee was established in Paris over the weekend, chaired by Churchill's son-in-law Sanders of the "United Europe Movement", and the chief of staff of former Polish Prime Minister Pincowski, Reidinger, representing the "European Cooperation and Independence League", served as secretary-general. It plans to set up offices in London and Paris within two weeks. The participants in the International Committee are representatives of the aforementioned four organizations, including British, French, Dutch, Belgian, Swiss, and Polish nationalities. According to Sanders, chairman of the committee: "As each day passes, the need for European unity becomes more urgent. The establishment of this new institution allows us to move together, strengthen the effectiveness of our appeal, and strengthen the power of the movement we are promoting."</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Responds Strongly, Advocating Reconstruction of Western Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Due to the unhappiness of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, Congress here demanded that there should be a stronger West Germany and that the transportation of German industrial products to the Soviet Union should be stopped. Congressional leaders urged the U.K., U.S., and France to take sole responsibility for rebuilding Western Europe, but the door for Soviet participation is not closed if Soviet leaders can change their minds. Marshall is expected to return here on the 19th to report to President Truman and the people on the London Conference, at which time Congress will ask him the question of "how should we proceed from now on". Vandenberg has not immediately commented on the breakdown of the London Conference, but Senator Connally pointed out that the world cannot wait forever for a compromise between East and West. He suggested that now is the time for the Western countries to decide the future destiny of Germany and Austria in their occupation zones.</p>
<p>Senator Smith, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is also one of the advocates of the West German group. Congressman Ferguson said that the failure of the London Conference makes it necessary for the United States to reconsider its position on the issue of Soviet reparations.</p>
<h3>Five Moderate Leftists Enter the Cabinet: The Italian Government Broadens Its Base; Assembling Forces to Resist Communist Forces</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 15th] It was officially announced here today that the Gasperi Cabinet has expanded its base, with Republican Party leader Bachiati and Right-wing Socialist Party leader Saragat joining the cabinet as deputy prime ministers, assisting Gasperi together with incumbent Deputy Prime Minister Ainoti. In addition, Republican Faccinetti is the Minister of Defense, Right-wing Socialist Dala Gona is the Minister of Post and Telecommunications, and Right-wing Socialist Trimmeloni is the Minister of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 15th] The five new members of the Italian cabinet were sworn in tonight. Prime Minister Gasperi praised the move as assembling forces to deal with the Communist opposition. Incumbent Foreign Minister Sforza originally promoted non-partisanship, and will now restore his Republican Party membership so that the two new parties of the government faction can each obtain a seat as Deputy Prime Minister and two seats as Minister, with the government faction's Christian Democratic Party giving up three seats to the two parties. The new coalition cabinet has a total of 283 votes in parliament.</p>
<h3>Stalin Returns to Soviet Capital from Black Sea</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 16th] It was learned today that Stalin has returned here from Saky Port on the Black Sea. Someone at a Moscow theater last Friday night personally saw him sitting in the audience watching a play. Stalin went to the port for vacation on September 9th by ship.</p>
<h3>I will attend the Small General Assembly next month: Jiang Tingfu will serve as representative concurrently; The Security Council will discuss the trusteeship of islands previously under Japanese control</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 15th] It was announced here today that China will be represented at the Small General Assembly by Jiang Tingfu, with Xu Shuxi as deputy representative. Jiang Tingfu's appointment as China's permanent representative to the Security Council has recently been confirmed by the Security Council, so Jiang now holds two positions concurrently. The Small General Assembly is scheduled to convene on January 5th next year. In addition to China, only Norway and Mexico have appointed their representatives. As for the Soviet Union, it has long expressed its opposition to this institution, so the six countries of the Slavic bloc will not participate in the meeting when the committee meets.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 15th, United Press] The United Nations is still discussing the issue of the Security Council's jurisdiction over the former Japanese trusteeship islands in the Pacific. The Security Council has appointed a committee of experts to study the draft proposal submitted by Australia to study the functions of the council. The Australian proposal gives the Trusteeship Council broad monitoring powers, as stipulated in the Charter, including improving the political, economic, social, and educational aspects of the residents of the islands.</p>
<h3>Soviet Obstruction of European Revival: Results Ultimately End in Failure</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 16th] U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin said in a speech to the American Farm Alliance today that the Soviet Union's propaganda campaign against the Marshall Plan for European revival has not only failed to damage it in the slightest, but has actually given it support. The recent strikes in France and Italy are part of the Soviet Union's anti-Marshall Plan movement, and the results have also ended in failure.</p>
<h3>U.S. Chief of Naval Operations: Nimitz Retires; Serves as Naval Advisor</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] It was officially announced here on the 15th that Admiral Nimitz, former commander of the Pacific Fleet during the war and current Chief of Naval Operations of the U.S. Navy, has retired after serving in the Navy for 42 years. Nimitz will reside in San Francisco and serve as a special advisor to Chief of Naval Operations Sullivan. Nimitz was born on February 24, 1885. From 1933 to 1935, he served as the captain of the U.S. cruiser Augusta, and then was promoted to assistant chief of the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy Department. In 1938, he was appointed as the commander of the first team of battleships in the Operations Department of the Navy Department. The following year, he served as the director of the Bureau of Navigation until December 1941, when he was appointed as the commander of the Pacific Fleet. In December 1944, he was promoted to five-star admiral of the Navy.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria and Albania Sign Mutual Assistance Pact: Soviet Troops Withdraw from Bulgaria</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: Sofia News, the Bulgarian government officially announced that Bulgaria and Albania have signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] Moscow Radio announced last night that the Soviet Union has completed the withdrawal of its troops stationed in Bulgaria in order to fulfill its treaty with the satellite states of Germany. At the same time, the U.S. military has also completed the withdrawal of its troops stationed in Italy. The Allied treaties with the four countries of Yi, Bao, Luo, and Xiong stipulate that Allied troops must withdraw from the countries within three months after the date of implementation of the treaty. The treaty came into effect on September 15, 1947. Regarding the treaty with Romania and Hungary, the Soviet Union may maintain its troops in these two countries to "protect" the transportation lines of its troops stationed in Austria.</p>
<h3>Eden to Visit Iran</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Conservative Party Deputy Leader Eden will visit Iran at the end of the month and inspect the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.</p>
<h3>Japan Attempts to Break Free from Control: Become a Member of the United Nations; Sato and Others Actually Sing Praises of Trusteeship Not Being Applicable</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Two Japanese diplomats today, in promoting Japan's joining the United Nations movement, first directly opposed MacArthur's proposed United Nations trusteeship plan for Japan. One is former Foreign Minister Sato and the other is former Minister to the Vatican Harada. It is said that trusteeship is not applicable to Japan. As far as the Japanese are concerned, if a control mechanism is needed after the establishment of the peace treaty, it is better to be jointly supervised by the Far Eastern Commission countries than to be jointly supervised by the United Nations. These remarks were made by the two at a press conference of the Japan United Nations Comrades Association Preparation Committee. The association is scheduled to be established on the 17th to educate the Japanese about the goals of the institution. Sato serves as the president and Harada serves as the secretary-general. Members include diplomats and professors. The association plans to quickly promote Japan's membership in the United Nations after the peace treaty is signed. Sato said that if the Allied countries are satisfied with Japan's implementation of the control policy, Japan's accession to the United Nations can be realized within two or three years. According to the new constitution, Japan must rely on the protection of the United Nations and even be subject to its control. Sato is recognized as the first-class diplomat in Japan today and is currently the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate. Sato was the last Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, so he is also considered to be Japan's Soviet Union expert. Harada served in the Secretariat of the old League of Nations for 19 years.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government and People Oppose Economic Reform: Making Political Reform Meaningless</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] The American Vanguard Forum commented on the various reforms in Japan in an editorial today, pointing out the important differences between political reform and economic reform. Japanese officials immediately accepted political reform, while economic reform was reluctantly agreed to "almost under the threat of American bayonets". The newspaper pointed out this difference in order to propose to those who believe that a revolution of thought has taken place in Japan overnight. The newspaper said: Not only conservative and stubborn people oppose economic reform, but also those who claim to be liberals and socialists. The legislation on commerce and industry passed by the Japanese parliament recently under MacArthur's order can prove this. This legislation is extremely difficult to implement outside the efforts of the U.S. military headquarters, so economic reform can only be implemented on paper, and the actual results are often poor. The most obvious example is the land reform industry law. Although it has been passed, the industry obtained from the landlords (who strongly support Japanese militarism) and handed over to the farmers is not much. The newspaper concluded by saying: The reason why most Japanese officials apparently agree to adopt political reform and oppose economic reform is that they are extremely opposed to any kind of reform of Japan in the past (that is, the Japan jointly ruled by militarists, semi-feudal landlords, and capitalists engaged in monopolies). These officials can accept the political reforms proposed and implemented by MacArthur and pretend to cooperate on the surface, but they can undermine them secretly by opposing economic reforms, making political reforms meaningless. They recognize that without economic reform, political reform is meaningless.</p>
<h3>Romanian Government Takes Over British Oil Company</h3>
<p>[United Press, Budapest, 15th] The Romanian government today took over two major oil companies in the country controlled by British people. The Romanian government also promulgated a decree, announcing this motive, and accusing the Royal Dutch Shell Company and Phoenix Oil and Transportation Company run by British people of "having malicious intentions, inefficient production, and stealing oil from the government's soil layers."</p>
<h3>France Struggles to Recover (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Our Paris Correspondent, Yi Ruo</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>[Our Paris Dispatch] Since the nationwide local elections in France in October, the political situation has formed a three-way standoff. De Gaulle and the Communists are irreconcilable; the Communists are unwilling to compromise with the current cabinet; and the cabinet and De Gaulle are not on good terms. Their strengths are evenly matched, and none is willing to show weakness, so none can control the overall situation. This has caused widespread anxiety, soaring prices, an unstable franc, and rising labor unrest. Ramadier searched everywhere for a successor for a month (since October 20th), and they remained in a stalemate, with no one able to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>Based on the results of this election, the supporters of De Gaulle are the most numerous, followed by the supporters of the Communists, but their vote count has not decreased, so the two have become formidable rivals, each unwilling to yield to the other. Both are in the opposition and want to overthrow Ramadier and replace him. However, with Ramadier squeezed in the middle, it is not easy to overthrow him. Ramadier is taking advantage of the discord between the left and the right to unite the four ruling parties to resist the political pressure from both sides. These four ruling parties are: the Socialist Party, which suffers defeats in every election; the Popular Republican Movement, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the election; the Social Radical Party, which has declined sharply; and the Republican Independent Party, which has no presence. This third combination formed by these four parties has more than 300 votes in parliament, which is enough to maintain Ramadier's position (the anti-Ramadier Communists only have 184 votes), because a vote of confidence in the new cabinet must pass an absolute majority in parliament—309 votes—to be effective. Ramadier is short of these nine votes, so his power appears weak and he is facing a shared fate of riding in the same boat. A slight carelessness could easily lead to his downfall.</p>
<p>De Gaulle's first attempt at electioneering showed a little promise, alarming the British and Americans and causing unease among the French authorities. The third combination was quickly formed to resist the dictatorial atmosphere brought by De Gaulle and to avoid the terror of a civil war that would occur if the left and right were to come into direct conflict. The purpose of this election was to replace local councilors and mayors in various regions and did not affect the organization of parliament. Therefore, although the De Gaulle faction won a majority of local seats in 52 of the 92 provinces nationwide, its strength in parliament is limited. Before the election, it only had nine seats. Before the election, more than thirty members jumped out of the Popular Republican Movement and favored De Gaulle, and the left-wing alliance had thirty people taking the same attitude, adding up to only seventy-two seats. In the total of six hundred and eighteen seats, it cannot play a significant role. Therefore, when De Gaulle hosted foreign journalists the other day, he brought out his proposal to re-elect the parliament. Unfortunately, he is in a country ruled by law, and a general's order cannot casually command the parliament. According to legal regulations, members of parliament have a four-year term, and three years must pass before the term expires. According to past history, France never easily dissolves parliament unless there is a special situation. In the past eighty years, it has only been dissolved once, unlike the British Parliament, whose term is set at seven years, but it is rare for it to sit until the end of its term. This is a huge difference between the British and French constitutional systems, and general jurists use this to show off, saying that British administration is higher than legislative power, and French legislative power is higher than administrative power. They speak with relish, while the listeners are at a loss. In fact, habit is better than human power, and our military power is better than civil power, isn't that also passed down from history?</p>
<p>The issue of re-electing the parliament can only be postponed, but the three-legged political situation is indeed not easy to support. The two parties in the opposition are stirring up trouble, and the ruling parties are really struggling to cope. This pillar in the middle cannot withstand the shocking waves. This is the symbol of the current French political situation.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The turbulent labor unrest can illustrate the precariousness of the French political situation. First, regarding the wage issue, since Ramadier took office at the beginning of the year, wages have been frozen, hoping that the devaluation policy would be realized and the two would be harmonized so that society could be stable and prosperous. Who knew that after three months, prices failed to decrease by three percent, and after another two months, they increased by ten percent, while wages remained frozen. The General Confederation of Labor weakly proposed a production bonus as a remedy, but it was not adopted. The Communist Party took the opportunity to withdraw from the cabinet to preserve its strength in the labor sector. In May and June, labor unrest broke out once. Prices continued to rise, and Ramadier allowed wages to be adjusted again in July, but then pushed it back to December. Jequier could not stand it any longer and automatically signed a labor-management agreement with the labor side, jointly resolving to increase wages by more than 11% (small wages can be increased to 42% to meet the minimum living cost of 8,000 francs per month). Who knew that after the government received this agreement, it was still hesitant and delayed for a whole month in August, and finally rejected it. Prices continued to rise, exceeding 40% of the beginning of the year. At this time, the salaried class was really out of breath. The General Confederation of Labor recently proposed a request to "increase wages by 25%" to meet the "minimum living cost of 10,800 francs per month," which of course had no response. So on the morning of November 19th, more than 100,000 coal miners in northern France refused to go down to mine coal, more than 100,000 dockworkers in Marseille no longer cared about loading and unloading goods, and more than 100,000 ironworkers in Paris did not go to forge iron. The wave of strikes was launched simultaneously across the country. Ramadier was under great pressure and saw that he really could not suppress it, so he began to retreat.</p>
<p>Since the election in October, the left and right wings in the opposition have received far more votes than all the parties in the ruling coalition. It is undeniable that Ramadier's prestige has declined. The ruling Popular Republican Movement wanted to recover from the wounds of the disastrous election and proposed to reorganize a strong government to replace the weak and incompetent Ramadier. The first to stir up the cabinet unrest was Le Cour, a spokesman for the party, who made this proposal to the President. The Left Wing Alliance has never approved of the government's "controlled economy" and has long wanted to change its taste. The leader of the alliance, Herriot, as the speaker of the National Assembly, wanted to bring out Le Noux, a member of the Moderate Party, to change the situation, to moderate the polarization of the left and right, and at the same time, with his financial management skills, stabilize the franc and perhaps stabilize prices. The ruling Socialist Party, although it suffers defeats in every election, always wants to be all things to all people and get some benefits. Although Ramadier is incompetent, he considers himself indispensable. In August, when the Socialist Party Congress gathered in Lyon, it was observed that Ramadier was not very energetic, and it decided on several new guidelines, but unfortunately, things have changed, and the decision was not implemented. After this general election, the Central Executive Committee of the party discussed countermeasures, preparing for Leon to succeed when Ramadier could not hold on, so that the premiership would still be hosted by the Socialist Party and would not fall into the hands of outsiders. Therefore, Leon and Le Noux seemed to be the masters of the future cabinet and immediately began to consult the opinions of various parties, visited the President, and reported the progress at any time. France has since entered a turbulent and uneasy situation, and until the afternoon of November 19th, it was constantly exploring and seeking a way out to break the deadlock. Who knew that something had happened at noon?</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The morning of November 19th: 300,000 workers in France began to strike. At noon, the Anglo-American Press Association hosted a banquet for the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Mollet, and asked him to express his views on French domestic affairs. It is said that Ramadier will soon leave his cabinet position, and his successor will be Leon. This thunderous statement caused a surge in the turbulent political situation. Upon hearing this, Le Noux immediately terminated his consultations. The Popular Republican Movement in Parliament was greatly surprised. The Left Wing Alliance believed that such a Socialist Party government, which only changed the soup but not the medicine, would not help the actual situation. The most surprised were the Socialist Party members, because they had not yet learned that the previous night (the 18th), Ramadier had encountered a snag in the Socialist Party cadre, and those who supported his policies had become a minority, and they did not know that Mollet had arbitrarily announced the "secret" of the party without their consent, which they felt was really inappropriate. Especially Ramadier himself, was somewhat unable to hold back his anger. On the one hand, he was regarded as a mere placeholder, and on the other hand, he was directly told of his end. Out of anger, he finally went to the President at 9 p.m. that night and submitted his resignation. The French cabinet unrest began from there.</p>

<h3>Rice Rationing Implemented Today Nationwide, Each Household Receives a Certificate for Purchase</h3>
<p>Social Bureau Orders Rice Shops to Report Transaction Amounts for Reference, Grain Stocked Along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and Central Trust Bureau's Foreign Rice Rushed to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] City officials believe that the recent rise in rice prices in the city is of great importance to the people's livelihood and have decided to implement a full rationing system from today onwards to suppress rice prices. To this end, Mayor Wu also hosted reporters in the City Hall auditorium at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, reporting four points: Due to the recent sudden rise in rice prices, the municipal government, in order to take care of poor households, has decided to implement the second phase of benefit rice distribution throughout the city. There are a total of 30 districts in the city, and 7 districts have already implemented rice distribution. The remaining 23 districts will all be rationed from the 17th, with a total of more than 110,000 dan. The rice distribution system for factory workers will continue to be implemented. There are more than 700,000 groups of miscellaneous grains stored on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications and President Zhang of the Executive Yuan have agreed to rush them to Shanghai in the short term. On the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, the two railway directors, Chen Bozhuang, have agreed to transport more than 10,000 shi of rice to Shanghai every day. The Central Trust Bureau will be able to transport 300,000 dan of 　Luo rice to Shanghai by the end of this month, at which time the amount of rice rationed in the city is expected to increase. In addition, in order to control rice prices, the municipal government has decided to implement a full rationing system and massively sell rice, similar to the cotton yarn disposal method, so as to suppress rice prices.</p>
<p>According to city government sources, the Municipal Standing Committee has decided to implement a full rice rationing system and has ordered the Social Bureau to follow the Public Utility Bureau's current method of issuing gasoline purchase certificates, with one certificate per household, stating the name and address and listing the number for purchasing rice. The area and quantity are not limited for the time being, but the purchasing merchants must record each purchaser one by one with the certificate for reference. After the foundation of this method is established, a quantitative distribution system will be implemented, with grain allocated according to the population. After receiving the order, the Social Bureau has been actively preparing and has instructed the rice shops to fill in the number of shi of japonica rice, indica rice, and glutinous rice sold and purchased in the past three months and their sources for reference. The Social Bureau will also convene responsible persons from each rice shop in each district for talks.</p>
<p>[Further News] Rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Tai Koo Company's Niuzhuang wheel, which transported 2,300 tons of rice from Manggok, arrived in Shanghai last Saturday and is currently being unloaded. The company's Nanchang wheel also transported 2,400 tons of rice from Bangkok and is expected to arrive today.</p>
<h3>Year-End Bonus Issue: Labor and Management Disagree, Representatives from the General Confederation of Labor and the Industrial Association Go to the Social Bureau to State Their Reasons</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Representatives from the General Confederation of Labor, Shui Xiangyun, Zhang Zhusan, Liang Yongzhang, Ye Xianggao, etc., went to the Social Bureau yesterday morning to state their opinions on the year-end bonus issue, requesting the implementation of the government's decision. They also said that if the management wants to issue the bonus in installments, they must obtain the consent of the labor side. When the representatives arrived at the bureau, it happened that representatives from the Industrial Association, Wu Yun Chu, Tian Heqing, Yan Yaoqiu, Ye Fu Kang, etc., also went to the Social Bureau to visit Director Wu for this issue. The Industrial Association believes that the year-end bonus is stipulated to be one month's salary in principle, and most factories are unable to bear it. Even if they can afford it, they are unable to pay it in one lump sum and must pay it in installments. At that time, Director Wu was receiving other visitors, so the representatives of both sides exchanged opinions in the reception room first. When Director Wu received them, they each stated their reasons. The representatives of the Industrial Association believe that the amount of the year-end bonus issued by each factory is too large, and the funds in the market may be insufficient. They wondered whether they could use the factory's products, discounted according to the wholesale price, as part of the bonus to be issued. Director Wu believes that this method is very good, but the products should only refer to the daily necessities needed by the workers. It will be submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion. In addition, the provision that workers must not strike or go slow during the process of handling year-end bonus disputes will also be submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion. Director Wu said that if the management is indeed in difficulty, labor and management can negotiate on their own and are not subject to the one-month salary restriction.</p>
<p>Wu Yun Chu, Tian Heji, and other five people from the Industrial Association also visited Mayor Wu yesterday and made a statement on the year-end bonus issue. The mayor was unable to meet with them because he was attending the 75th anniversary celebration of the China Merchants Bureau and agreed to go again today.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Leader Li Zhaohuan Talks About the Situation of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Li Zhaohuan, a Chinese leader in Boston, USA, has a long-standing reputation for running businesses in that city. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he called on patriotic Chinese in the United States to establish the New England Aid China Committee and spared no effort in donating. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Li contacted responsible persons in the US government and promoted the establishment of the US government's Training Committee for Chinese Technical Personnel, with more than 2,000 trainees. This time, the United States sent more than 100 business representatives to Japan to investigate, and Li was also among them, becoming the first Chinese to serve as a US business representative. Li recently went to Japan and passed through Shanghai, staying for a short time. A reporter interviewed him yesterday, and according to him: "Overseas Chinese have great potential in business in various places, but they still lack contact. Most overseas Chinese are willing to establish factories in the motherland and are willing to raise funds themselves to hire management and technical personnel. Overseas Chinese in the United States alone remitted 70 million US dollars last year, not including the travel vouchers and cash brought by returning overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia also remit a lot. However, under the current foreign management system, there are great difficulties in both overseas remittances and investment. I sincerely hope that the government can make reasonable amendments."</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, November 16] Yin Lansun and 12 other criminals involved in the major smuggling case involving collusion between officials and merchants at the Shanghai Customs House were escorted to Nanjing and transferred to the Capital District Court along with documents and stolen goods on the 16th. The handling prosecutor, Tian Jihou, opened the court at about 5 p.m. and conducted a strict interrogation on the most serious Lu Genji case for more than two hours. The key to solving this case was that Lu Genquan of Lu Genji contacted the staff of the Security Bureau after receiving the notice of bribery and used 1.46 billion legal currency as bait to lure them into the trap, and then tracked down the case. The distribution of the spoils in the Lu case was as follows: Yin Lansun (Director of the Import Permit Verification Section of the Jianghai Customs House) US$1,500. Yue Xinmin (Assistant) US$1,700, plus US$1,300 pocketed. Zhang Baohui (Assistant) US$1,500. Zhang Yuan (who used to work at the Customs House and was the Shanghai representative of Isha) US$2,000, plus intermediary merchant Mei Futang US$200 and 12.9 million legal currency. Zhang Gaozhen US$300 and 12.9 million legal currency, plus US$100 for expenses and US$100 pocketed. Shen Yanlu US$300 and 12.9 million legal currency for the first time, US$680 and 70 million legal currency for the second time, plus US$1,000 pocketed. Fang Maolin US$680, plus 200 million legal currency pocketed. Related person Mao Fengxiang intercepted 20 tons of galvanized iron, and Jiang Baoliang intercepted 10 tons of galvanized iron. The absconding reporting merchants Guo Ziming and Bu Jiazhen each received US$300 and 12.9 million legal currency. As for Mao Runxiang, Yang Shude, and Chen Lianggang, they only participated in running errands and did not share the spoils. It is learned that Mao Fengxiang stated in his original confession that when he contacted both parties, Lu Genquan complained that the foreign exchange used for purchasing 400 tons of galvanized iron cost 100 million yuan, which was obtained from the Bank of China, and the source was also problematic. He asked the court to investigate the case, which may lead to unexpected complications.</p>

<h3>Coal Merchant Kidnapped in Wuxi, Accomplices Arrested and Principal Culprit Identified</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yu Xingquan, 48 years old, from Wuxi, opened Heji Coal Shop at No. 725 Tanggu Road. Last month, Yu Ding, 10, was engaged in his hometown, and Yu and his wife returned to the Yu family home in Dongwan, Wuxi to host a banquet for guests. On the afternoon of the 14th, at 8 p.m., three robbers suddenly came, one holding a submachine gun and the other holding a revolver, posing as detectives and kidnapped Yu. In the darkness, they walked about five or six miles to a place. The robbers clapped their hands as a signal, and one person walked out of the shed to help escort Yu in, saying, "I am the leader of the Communist Economic Group." He said that Yu had 50 gold bars, which were essential. Yu replied that he did not have such a large amount of money and was locked in the shed. At about 11 a.m. the next day, the robbers finally agreed with Yu to take 100 million yuan. Yu gave a telephone number for Heji Coal Shop, and the robbers released him. The two parties agreed to use the words "Dangxi" as the code when collecting the money. The robbers then sent a person to accompany Yu on foot to Luoshe, took a car to his home in Wuxi, and safely returned to Shanghai on the 17th. At noon on the 20th, Yu received a call from the robbers, saying that they were in Room 76 of the Dahua Hotel on Ninghai East Road and ordered Yu to put a large amount of money into a sack and send it over. Yu personally carried 100 million yuan in cash, divided into two sacks, and sent it over. He met a thin robber, checked that everything was correct, shook hands and said goodbye. However, this case has been known to the North Railway Station Police Sub-bureau, knowing that a resident within its jurisdiction was kidnapped in another port, it immediately began to investigate. After more than ten days, it was learned that the accomplices were hiding in Room 1, 3rd Floor, No. 45 Julu Road. Sub-bureau Chief Ying Zhichun ordered Squad Leader Wang Shou and squad members Bei Bin, Chen Yifei, and Sun Shanggeng, 　Officer Zheng Jingren, and others to go to the scene and arrest four people, Zhang Heng, Lin Aizhen (a Metropolitan dancer), Liu Boliang, and Shen Juxing, and bring them back to the bureau for questioning. According to Zhang, he used to be a battalion commander of the guerrillas and once led military agencies to appease the bandits, but because he failed to complete his mission, he was detained by the authorities and released on the 14th of last month. Yu was a friend and after Yu was kidnapped, at the request of Yu's wife, he had tried to rescue him. Later, after investigating Liu and Shen, it was learned that the mastermind of the case was Feng Boming. Zhang sent a letter to Feng, which Liu and Shen took to 　to release him, so the bandits negotiated directly with the hostage and resolved the matter with 100 million yuan. Liu and Shen confessed to having helped run errands and received 9 million yuan. They also confessed that there were two guns, which Lin Aizhen brought from Shanghai to Wuxi, one hidden at the foot of Meiyuan Mountain and the other under Huiquan Mountain. Squad Leader Wang ordered squad member Chen Yifei, staff Tang Mubing, Liu Mingjia, Huang Weisheng, and Ding Fanglong to disguise themselves and go to Wuxi to retrieve them and bring them back to Shanghai for filing. The absconding mastermind, Feng Boming, is still being pursued.</p>

<h3>Doctor and Son Busted for Manufacturing Toxic Powder</h3>
<p>Secret Chamber Found Under Floorboards - Large Quantities of White Powder Raw Materials and Tools Seized - Unlawful Manager of Da Hu Pharmacy Also Arrested</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yang Jian, a native of Pudong, was secretly manufacturing white powder narcotics in a disguised Chinese medicine clinic on the fourth floor of No. 14 Huangpi South Road. The matter was discovered by the judicial section of the Songshan Police Sub-bureau, and officer Tan Delin, along with police chief Ma Jun, police officer Chen Junfeng, and others, went there at 1 a.m. on the 12th, feigning illness to seek medical treatment. Mr. Yang opened the door, and the police officers began their operation. They heard rustling sounds from inside a room, but the door was tightly closed. When questioned, Yang claimed that his wife, Xue Youzhen, was "relieving herself". The officers waited for a long time before the door opened, and Yang's wife looked visibly panicked. The officers searched the area and found a wide gap in the floorboards. They lifted it and saw a staircase leading down. Descending the stairs, they found two basins on the floor, containing twenty-two packages of white powder of varying sizes, as well as six taels, eight maces, and four and a half candareens of raw materials for manufacturing, placed on sieves and other tools. The officers took the narcotics, tools, and the Yang Jian couple to the bureau. After interrogation, they confessed that the raw materials for other narcotics were purchased by Yang's father, Hanqing, from Da Hu Pharmacy at No. 278 Fuzhou Road. Thereupon, another investigating officer arrested Yang's father and escorted him to Da Hu Pharmacy to purchase two pounds of the material. Subsequently, the pharmacy's manager, Huang Quifeng (a Ningbo native, 28 years old), was arrested, and eight pounds of the material were found and confiscated.

<h3>Guarantor Xiao Hanmin Detained</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Direct Taxation Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Finance stating that Huang, a Shanghai Municipal Councilor, reported that Liu Mancheng and Huang Ruizhi, auditors of the bureau, discovered discrepancies between the reported figures and the actual figures of goods in and out of the China-Europe Sugar Factory when they were sent to audit the factory. They then intimidated the factory with fines. Subsequently, the factory's accountant arranged for Liu and Huang to meet at Guanshengyuan, where they agreed on a bribe of 20 million yuan. Huang Zude, director of the bureau, ordered specialist Shao Weizu to investigate. According to the investigation report, although the defendants denied soliciting bribes, they delayed the audit report for five days against regulations, raising suspicions of malpractice. The bureau first dismissed Liu and Huang and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The two defendants repeatedly failed to appear in court, so the guarantors were summoned for questioning yesterday. Huang's guarantor, Chen Zubao, owner of Zhengda Printing Press, claimed that Huang had died of illness on November 21st, and presented a telegram as proof. The prosecutor was highly suspicious of this. Liu's guarantors were Zhao Xuetao and Xiao Hanmin. Zhao was released on bail, and Xiao was detained and given a deadline to produce the defendant Liu Mancheng before he could be released.</p>
<h3>Navigation Administration Takes Over Water Management Rights - Striking Pilots Join the Public Association - New Standards Set for Collection of Fees</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The water management rights for the Shanghai area were transferred from the Customs to the Navigation Administration yesterday. The Navigation Administration has established a Water Pilotage Section, headed by Huang Xichou. However, the actual work will be entrusted to the Tongsha Pilot Association, which has set up an office at Room 407, Li Han Building, Fuzhou Road.</p>
<p>The twenty-two Customs pilots who had their licenses revoked due to the strike, except for one who has left China, have all joined the Tongsha Pilot Association and resumed work. The remaining nineteen foreign pilots and two Chinese pilots. Englishman Chilton and Chinese Zhu Zhe remain as the chief and assistant managers of the new association. Among the original eighteen Chinese pilots in the Tongsha Pilot Association, Jin Yueshi, Qin Zhengru, Ji Zenggan, and Li Yunqu have begun work. Two others have less experience and have been granted internship positions. The remaining twelve have not yet participated due to other jobs or insufficient experience. As for the White Russian pilots temporarily employed by the Customs, they will be retained until the end of the year. Therefore, the current number of pilots has increased compared to when the Customs managed them, and shipping in the city can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>The collection of water pilotage fees has been revised by the Navigation Administration with new standards and has been notified to all shipping companies for payment. The calculation method is quite complicated. Roughly speaking, the fee for a 10,000-ton vessel with a draft of 26 feet traveling from Tongsha to Shanghai is 54 million yuan. This standard is adjusted every week based on actual conditions. The income of the pilots is based on a proportional sharing of the total monthly income of the association. The number of ships entering and leaving varies, so the amount is not fixed. The original US$500 previously paid to foreign pilots at the official rate has been cancelled, and all payments are made in national currency. However, under the new fee standards, their income is still expected to increase by about 20%.</p>

<h3>Sir Sassoon Donates 25 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of the Shanghai office of the National Panyang Textile Factory using the name of the Northeast Branch of the Resources Commission to privately transport a large quantity of dyes from Panyang to Shanghai is currently being tried in the local court. The details of the case are gradually becoming clear, involving Zhu Zemin, manager of the Panyang Textile Factory, Chen Keming, deputy manager, and Zhu Zemin's younger brother Zhu Tingyang (who works at the Material Supply Office of the Resources Commission's Northeast Branch). The Zhus colluded to use the seals of the Material Supply Office of the Resources Commission's Northeast Branch and Zhu Tingyang used the official letter of the branch to request the allocation of aircraft for transportation. On the 27th of last month, eight aircraft flew from Panyang to Peiping. At the Peiping Airport, one of the aircraft had a malfunction, unloading 43 barrels of dye. On the 28th, the aircraft flew to Nanking, and on the 29th, they arrived in Shanghai. Jiangwan Airport saw that the goods belonged to the Resources Commission and telegraphed the Shanghai office of the commission, which sent a vehicle to transport the goods. After hearing the news, the Shanghai office of the National Panyang Textile Factory panicked and sent its staff Chen Shanmin to negotiate the return of the goods, claiming that the dyes were transported to Shanghai for the purpose of opening the Shenjiang Textile Factory. The Shanghai office of the Resources Commission, seeing that they were using the Resources Commission's name for private gain and that the circumstances of malpractice were obvious, requested the police bureau to arrest Liu Tianhong and others and transfer them to the criminal division of the local court for trial. However, according to a letter from the Executive Yuan Air Transport Brigade, the brigade did not have any aircraft loading any goods in Qingyang, and the brigade's aircraft all took off and landed at Hongqiao Airport, so the so-called eight aircraft must belong to another aviation agency.</p>

<h3>Horse Dealer's Home Robbery and Resistance Case Solved - Three Thousand Strong Bandit with Devoted Followers Finally Captured</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] On the evening of the 21st of last month, around 6 p.m., a robbery occurred at the home of Mr. Ma Boluo, manager of the American Palm Olive Soap Company, at No. 326 Fan Yu Road. A total of six bandits came, and Director Shao of the Changmi Police Sub-bureau personally supervised section chief Shi Jieren, officer Wei Jinquan, and more than eighty police officers, militia police, and security police to surround the area and fight the bandits. One bandit (Wang A'er) was killed on the spot. After investigation, it was learned that the ringleader of this gang was Zhang Jipin, also known as Little Jipin, a native of Xinjiang, 42 years old, with more than three thousand followers under his command, and famous among the bandit parties. Knowing that Ma's residence contained a large amount of U.S. dollars and two five-carat diamond rings, he coveted the wealth. The day before, Zhang gathered his associates in the Wenmiao Garden to plan the robbery. The next afternoon, around 4 p.m., Zhang first arrived at a small teahouse nearby to wait. All the firearms were transported by the deceased bandit Wang A'er to the alley next door to Ma's residence, where they were distributed to the bandits. They took advantage of the return of Ma's second son, Ma Shiwei, from school at 6 p.m. to follow him into the house and carry out the robbery, leading to a major struggle. According to Wang A'er's fingerprints, the sub-bureau discovered that the bandit had committed two previous crimes</p>
<p>In the files, Wang's younger brother, Wang Zhaojing, resided at No. 200 Chengxing Lane, which was found to be No. 86 Dianchang Lane, Caojiadu, the address of Wang A'er's mother-in-law. After visiting and investigating, it was learned that Wang A'er's family resided at No. 27 Xindu Ferry, Zhongshan North Road. Wang's wife, Wang Liu Xiuzhen, was taken to the bureau for questioning. She stated that recently Li Jingguo, who lives at No. 18 Sanguantang Road in the South City, had come twice and was now working as a ticket collector at the Longmen Grand Theater.

When they moved to arrest them, they had already fled to Gaomiao in Pudong. The next day, the criminal Chen was captured and confessed that all the firearms were in Lv Jie's home. According to the confession, five Mauser pistols and box cannons were found. He also confessed that the six-inch Mauser pistol was robbed on October 4 when they robbed Ni Baochang's house at No. 7 Dexing Lane, Sanjiao Street, Lujiabang Road in the South City.

<p>Was extremely great. Director Shao Yuanbin of the sub-bureau, because the principal offender Zhang Jipin was at large, ordered section chief Shi to send police to investigate. It was learned that Zhang sometimes lived with his sister in Caojiadu, and sometimes at his concubine's place at No. 13 Ziti Road, Xiaonanmen. His legal wife lived in Panpu, a rural village in Cixi. On the 8th, section chief Shi led police chief Li Wenbin and officers Gu Kunqi and Wang Jianhua to travel there by boat, but they had already fled to Ningbo. The police followed them to Ningbo, and learned that they had returned to Shanghai. After returning to Shanghai, they learned that Zhang was staying in a certain room in the Mengyuan Hotel. They first arrested his follower Jin Heshang and took him to</p>
<p>The Hotel to Capture Him</p>
<p>Learned that Zhang had left. According to Jin Heshang, Zhang was trying to avoid arrest and did not want to stay in Shanghai for long, intending to flee to Hong Kong temporarily. He had asked Jin to tell his brother-in-law to collect money at his sister's house in Caojiadu at 1 p.m. on the 14th and send it to a pawnshop at No. 204 Lane, Wusong Road. Section chief Shi and officer Wei went there and finally arrested him. The criminal Zhang confessed to committing dozens of cases, which he could not remember all at once. Subsequently, a large number of stolen goods were recovered, including more than twenty taels of gold bars, jade rings, fox fur coats, gray back coats, etc. He is currently under strict interrogation.</p>
<h3>Lou Guowei Suspected of Embezzlement - Reported by Two Money Exchanges</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The District Procuratorate opened a court yesterday to investigate the case of former Direct Taxation Bureau Director Lou Guowei being accused of embezzlement. Chen Mingsheng, Li Zumian, Tang Qin, and Dai Yun, four staff members of the bureau, were summoned. Except for Dai Yun, who did not appear, the others attended the court to testify. The main focus of yesterday's interrogation was whether there were any malpractices in the bureau's collection of profit taxes for the 35th year and the liquidation of financial institutions. Since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, more than 300 banks and money exchanges in the city related to the enemy and puppet regimes were ordered to close. However, these institutions still needed to pay a large amount of back taxes, which were handled by the Direct Taxation Bureau. Several staff members of the bureau took the opportunity to nitpick and extort money. In the case of the Wuzhou and Jiu'an money exchanges, because negotiations failed, the tax payments were increased to more than 200 times the original amount. The managers of the two money exchanges, believing that the bureau was engaged in extortion and embezzlement, filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate against Lou Guowei, the former director of the bureau, and Wang Mingyi, the section chief. Chen Mingsheng and others who were summoned yesterday were involved in the case and were ordered to return after the interrogation.</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Suppression in Jiangnan - Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province Delivers Important Radio Address</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper from Zhenjiang on the 14th] With the commencement of the comprehensive suppression of bandits in Jiangnan, Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province has delivered a radio address of great significance to the 34 million people of the province, as well as the commissioners, county magistrates, and all levels of civil and military personnel. An excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>This comprehensive suppression in Jiangnan is a struggle for survival with the Communist bandits. It is to ensure the peace of all people and to achieve lasting tranquility. We have an extremely firm confidence in completing this task. At the same time, our province is adjacent to the capital, and eliminating the Communist bandits to protect the capital is our responsibility as people of Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Now, I will explain our understanding and tasks during the comprehensive suppression in Jiangnan separately: Commissioners, County Magistrates,</p>
<p>Commissioners, County Magistrates,</p>
<p>All levels of Civil and Military Personnel:</p>
<p>During the suppression period, the county magistrate must constantly go to the countryside to convene meetings of district, township, and baojia chiefs to complete three tasks: (1) suppressing bandits, (2) organizing various people's self-defense forces, and (3) supervising grain collection. All tasks must be completed within the time limit.</p>
<p>The joint defense between counties and between villages and towns must be effectively organized, with frequent joint patrols and guard duty. Every village and town must be guarded day and night by people's self-defense forces taking turns on duty. Special attention must be paid to the night, dusk, and dawn to prevent the bandits from passing through or gathering secretly. Each village should prepare watch drums and gongs for nightly patrols. If traces of bandits are discovered, the gongs must be sounded immediately to raise the alarm, and the people must rise up to fight the bandits. Neighboring villages must help each other and encircle the bandits to prevent them from escaping.</p>
<p>Each county must value the strength of the people's self-defense organizations. They should follow the "Regulations on the Organization and Training of People's Self-Defense Forces" issued by the central government, adhering to the principles of "soldiers not leaving their weapons, weapons not leaving the village, local officials selected locally, and local grain raised locally," to improve the organization: A. The existing people's self-defense forces should include: (1) county standing self-defense companies; (2) township standing self-defense squads. Existing firearms and registered civilian firearms should be used as much as possible, and their salaries and expenses should be uniformly allocated and directed by the county magistrate. They should actively and mobilely search and suppress scattered bandits, and should be active frequently, not excessively regimented. B. The people's self-defense forces that do not separate from production should include: (1) Class A people's self-defense forces; (2) urban people's self-defense organizations organized according to the Class A self-defense force system. All able-bodied men in the county between the ages of eighteen and forty-five should be included in the organization according to regulations. In addition to using the firearms allocated to the standing squads, they should also use broadswords, spears, and hand grenades as supplements. Everyone must have a weapon in hand and be trained in its use, taking on tasks such as patrol, guard, rescue, and transportation. In the event of a bandit alarm, they should rise up together to fight the bandits with all their might. With the people's self-defense forces with firearms as the center, everyone should work hard to prevent the bandits from escaping.</p>
<p>The county magistrate must supervise the district, township, and baojia chiefs to conduct a household-by-household census in every village in the county, squeezing out the lurking Communist bandits. District, township, and baojia chiefs and villagers are responsible for reporting. Each case must be thoroughly investigated, and a small number of armed forces should be used to launch surprise searches to capture the lurking Communist elements. Not only must the Communist bandits' armed forces be eliminated, but the bandits' party and government organizations and special agents must also be captured.</p>
<p>From the county to the district, township, and baojia, there must be a strict intelligence network to constantly detect bandit activity and secretly report it to the county magistrate and nearby troops for immediate search and annihilation.</p>
<p>Our province is following the decision of the Six-Province Suppression Review Meeting, adopting a military system, and has declared Jiangnan a garrison area and Jiangbei a pacification area. All cases of banditry will be tried by military law. Furthermore, in order to quell the rebellion and in response to the emergency measures necessary for suppressing bandits, I, as commissioner and county magistrate, am responsible for dealing with important bandits captured. If emergency measures are necessary, the case should be investigated clearly and reported to the province, and submitted to the provincial government for review and approval before execution. Secondary important criminals should be given long-term imprisonment and re-education to prevent them from aiding the bandits and affecting public security. This measure has been reported to the central government and circulated for implementation. We must understand that the Communist bandits are social germs and arsonist thugs. If the bandits are allowed to run rampant, the majority of good people will be killed by the bandits. Lenience towards a few evil people is cruelty towards the majority of good people, so we must use strict laws to suppress banditry. In other words, it is precisely for the purpose of rectifying discipline and protecting the lives and property of all people that each county must maintain its determination to suppress bandits and eradicate the Communist germs. At the same time, in accordance with the central government's order, strictly enforce that no one may be released on bail in banditry cases before the trial is concluded.</p>
<p>The security forces, river police, and all county corps police, civil and military personnel stationed in various counties of our province should cooperate with the comprehensive suppression mission and work hard and diligently. In particular, the corps police are responsible for protecting the local area and must have the determination of "either bandits or me" and "either me or no bandits". They should actively and mobilely move out day and night to help the county government clear the population. They should also pay attention to discipline and avoid violating the people when stationed outside. It is only by rectifying discipline and integrating the armed forces with the people that they can become a truly civilian force and gain the assistance and support of the people.</p>
<p>County Public Opinion Organizations</p>
<p>And Local Leaders from All Walks of Life:</p>
<p>Everyone hates the brutality of the Communist bandits, and your strong will and correct understanding are admirable. During this period of comprehensive suppression, I hope that everyone will work together to assist governments at all levels, complete the mobilization and fulfill the national policy of suppressing the bandits, and awaken the people at all times and in all places to rise up and fight the bandits. Chairman Chiang said at the Six-Province Suppression Review Meeting that measures needed for bandit suppression must be implemented and there can be no obstacles. He also instructed the governors of each province to tell all public opinion organizations to work together to complete this great mission.</p>
<p>Various measures needed for bandit suppression, such as organizing the people's self-defense forces, providing salaries and clothing expenses for the corps police and public school employees, setting up telecommunications and transportation, managing the baojia household registration system, and constructing bunkers, are all very heavy and important tasks. Without a strong organization and effort, the Communist bandits cannot be thoroughly eliminated and social tranquility ensured. At present, local finances are tight, but bandit suppression measures are urgently needed. Our public opinion organizations and leaders from all walks of life have deeply understood this reality, and I hope that you will tell all the people to raise the awareness of the struggle for survival against bandits, displaying the spirit of the War of Resistance, contributing money if you have money, and contributing effort if you have effort. The strength of all the people is our copper wall and iron wall. A month ago, I flew to Xuzhou because of the tense military situation outside of Xuzhou and personally discussed plans to strengthen the city's fortifications with Commander Gu. I convened a meeting of local people and quickly raised a huge sum of 20 billion yuan for construction, which was jointly managed by the Army Headquarters and local communities. Most of the construction funds were paid by the industrial and financial sectors. Although Xuzhou has suffered from repeated wars and the economy has declined, it was still able to raise this huge sum, and the people's morale is firm and courageous, which is truly commendable. I especially hope that people in Jiangnan society will use this spirit to work together to establish public security in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Field grains and taxes are legitimate public supplies. In particular, grain is needed to cooperate with the needs of the suppression of rebellion, so it is necessary to actively pay, speed up collection, as people of any country have the obligation to pay grain and taxes. The Communist bandits attempt to obstruct grain administration and undermine good landlord-tenant relations, conspiring to instigate resistance to grain and rent, intimidating landlords and wealthy households with confiscation of property in order to carry out their conspiracy to extort grain and labor. We must recognize the Communist bandits' tricks. The Communist bandits are jealous of the smooth progress of grain administration and labor administration, which is what we should strive to implement. The Communist bandits take landlords and wealthy households as targets of struggle, so large households should take the lead in paying grain in order to assist in the completion of the bandit suppression mission and ensure their own lives and property.</p>
<h3>Township and Village Chiefs and All Citizens</h3>
<p>Township and village chiefs are the cornerstone of grassroots politics. They are responsible for household registration of residents under their jurisdiction, reporting suspected communist elements, and will be punished as harboring bandits if they fail to report or discover them in advance and allow them to hide.</p>
<p>If the people discover traces of bandits, they must immediately report them secretly to the township and village chiefs, who should immediately report them to the county government and quickly search and arrest them for legal action by the county. The people must be responsible for reporting traces of bandits in adjacent hidden areas. Failure to report bandits will be punished as harboring bandits according to the regulations of joint guarantee and shared responsibility.</p>
<p>Grassroots personnel at both ends of the spectrum, in the mountains and counties, will be investigated and rectified one by one, and those found to be bandits will be punished as such.</p>
<p>Township and village chiefs and the people must not cover up for bandits. If they allow the collection of grain, extort money, communicate with bandits, discuss with bandits, or harbor bandits, they will be punished as bandits once verified.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said, "Using soldiers is not as good as using the people." For their own safety and to avoid being killed by a small number of communist bandits, the people should all strive to survive, firmly resolve to suppress bandits, participate in self-defense work, and fight to the death, refusing to coexist with communist bandits. All government measures to suppress bandits are based on the needs of the majority of the people. We must complete the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and make concerted efforts. As far as Jiangsu is concerned, since the restoration, I have been encouraging the entire province to "restore order, stabilize people's livelihood," and have repeatedly told the local elders and compatriots to be brave in self-defense and to seek regeneration through self-reliance. If the 34 million people of Jiangsu can work together with one heart, not only can they quell the chaos in Jiangsu, but also easily suppress the banditry throughout the country!</p>
<h3>Changshu Police Chief Embezzles Salaries, Assembly Sends Letter Requesting Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changshu, 15th] Since the opening of the fourth session of the first Changshu County Assembly on the 12th, after listening to reports on county government work and engaging in heated inquiries, more than 40 proposals were passed, and the meeting successfully closed on the 15th. Regarding the county magistrate's discussion on the issue of merging townships and towns, it was not passed after careful discussion.</p>
<p>Also: Police Chief Huang Cheng embezzled the salaries of 49 vacant police positions. After being revealed by Councilor Zhao (Mingjiong), Councilor Xu (Houyuan) and others expressed their opinions, and as a result, it was listed as a temporary motion and unanimously passed on the spot, with a letter sent to the county requesting an investigation. Further news: The local civil shipping industry association is fraught with shady dealings and has been ordered by the provincial government to rectify. It is now learned that the Food Administration has also received a secret report, the content of which is that Staff Officer Zhou of the First Garrison Branch of the Joint Logistics Department was ordered last month to come to Changshu to guard and transport 2,000 large packages of military grain to Shanghai, which were handed over to the civil shipping association. At that time, it was stated that each package would cost 11,000 yuan, which was contracted to Wang Longbao of the Xieyu Transport Company. However, after the goods were transported to Shanghai, only 5,000 yuan per package was received for transportation costs. The remaining 6,000 yuan was embezzled by Wu Zhemin and Shi Shengji, staff members of the association, amounting to nearly two-thirds. The director, Wang Ziqiang, covered it up and enjoyed the benefits. After the county office received the report, it attached great importance to it and has dispatched personnel to conduct a secret investigation and will deal with it impartially.</p>

<h3>False Claim of Recruiting Workers, Defrauding Villagers of Property, Major Swindler Xue Fubao Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 15th] In the area of Huazhuang Sihe Township in the southern countryside of this county, two people, a man and a woman, falsely claimed to be recruiting workers for a Shanghai factory and defrauded a large amount of money from the local villagers. More than 100 villagers were deceived one after another. The mastermind, Xue Fubao, from Yanqiao, 27 years old, used to work in a rubber overshoe factory in Shanghai. Because of his improper behavior, he was fired by the factory in April of this year. He returned to Wuxi and, after being idle for several months, Xue was extremely bored and came up with a whimsical idea to deceive the villagers in the countryside for a living. He happened to meet Zhou Panqi, a farmer from Xipengtou Village, Qianqiao, and they colluded with each other. Xue falsely claimed to be a foreman of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory in Shanghai and was ordered to come to Qianqiao to recruit 50 workers, with a monthly salary of 1.4 million yuan and free food and lodging. Zhou was moved by the news and fell into his trap. He immediately introduced Xue to others and volunteered to recruit dozens of people. He went to his home in Qianqiao and gathered 31 men and women from the same village that night, each paying 25,000 yuan as an introduction fee to Xue. The next day, Xue led them by car to Shanghai. Xue sent the villagers to a thatched shed near Xujiahui to stay temporarily, and then falsely claimed that he was going to the trade union to register. The crowd waited for a long time but he did not return. They went to the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory to inquire, and the factory replied that there was no such person. The crowd then realized that they had been deceived. However, they did not bring much money and wandered back to Wuxi, enduring great hardship. Recently, Xue and a woman deceived more than 80 men and women villagers in the southern countryside with the same trick, obtaining more than 8 million yuan. On the 14th of this month, a girl named Wang Gendi, who was one of the victims, happened to meet the major swindler on the road and dragged him to the criminal police team. On the 15th, he was transferred to the local prosecutor's office for legal action.</p>

<h3>Wu Yun Chu Donates Funds to Establish University Chemical Engineering Scholarship; Fifteen Universities Nationwide Participate; Sixty Students Apply and Pass</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Industrialist Wu Yun Chu has been engaged in industry for over thirty years, and has always been eager to help others and do good. In the Republic era, he pioneered the Poor Students Education Fund, which has cultivated scientific talent with remarkable results. In recent years, he has handed over all his shares in various businesses to the public, organizing the Yun Chu Asset Management Committee to use the profits for public welfare expenses, which was then reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Shanghai Local Court for record filing. Previously, the Management Committee resolved to establish the University Chemical Engineering Scholarship in the 36th year of the Republic era, aiming to encourage the revitalization of chemical engineering, which was felt to be difficult. However, despite the difficulties, the process continued without interruption, and it is expected that the pre-war state can be restored by 1950. Mr. Li also discussed the steps of this four-year plan with the Chinese Medical Association. Dr. Li is now traveling to the capital, Beijing, to consult with the central authorities, and then will fly to the United States from Shanghai to conduct inspections and raise funds for the Peking Union Medical College, as well as for technical talents and to subsidize poor students. It is stipulated that the scholarship will be granted only to support the research work of fourth-year students in universities and independent colleges. Experts were hired to form a review committee, and an announcement was issued in August of this year, and letters were sent to various universities for investigation and cooperation. By November 30th, the number of applicants was exceptionally high, so the original quota of 40 was increased to 60, and scholarships totaling 120 million yuan were awarded.

<h3>"The Therapeutic Effect of Nebulization Therapy for Asthma"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Guoshu</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital Provides Special Equipment for Patients' Use</p>
<p>In my previous article in this publication, "Phlegm-Fluid Asthma," I provided some instructions on the drug treatment of asthma. However, asthma is known to be stubborn and difficult to treat. In addition to drug therapy, it is also advisable to use nebulization therapy to assist it. This "nebulization therapy" is quite effective, so I am adding supplementary information to inform asthma sufferers.</p>
<p>The so-called "nebulization therapy" for asthma involves using one or several drugs in the form of water vapor spray, so that its effect directly reaches the patient's bronchial tubes and plays a functional role. The incessant work of asthma is actually caused by the bronchial tubes. This nebulization therapy is sufficient to relieve the tension of the bronchial tubes and reduce its attacks, and the symptoms are greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Patients with asthma should use nebulization therapy twice a day. During severe attacks, it is advisable to use it several times more, and its effect will be even more significant.</p>
<p>When administering nebulization therapy, aim the nebulizer at the patient's mouth and nose, and use a specially made mask to cover the head, so that the drug can directly reach the trachea. Regarding the drugs used during nebulization, they should be used according to the severity of the disease and the different causes of the disease, so that they can be effective. Care should be taken. If it is cardiac asthma (i.e., asthenic asthma), it is not advisable to use this nebulization therapy. Therefore, patients should first seek medical diagnosis before using it.</p>
<p>The equipment used for nebulization must be specially made, and most ordinary private clinics are not equipped with it. Because I feel that the procedure is troublesome, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital has specially prepared this equipment to meet the needs of patients at any time. I have used this to cure many cases of asthma, and there are experienced nurses to manage this matter, so it is more reliable.</p>
<h3>Women's "Typhoid Fever"</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhongli</p>
<p>Women's typhoid fever is no different from men's, but it often occurs when menstruation is about to arrive, so there are many changes, and it is important to distinguish them. It is necessary to make a detailed diagnosis so as not to be mistaken. The name typhoid fever is a common term, not the proper name. It is called winter warmth when it is contracted in winter, which is also what Western medicine calls paratyphoid fever. The initial symptoms include fever, chills, headache and dizziness, weakness in the limbs, chest tightness and nausea, white and greasy tongue coating, and a soft and rapid pulse. If it coincides with the arrival of menstruation, the menstruation is light, the color is bright or dark, and there are blood clots, excessive vaginal discharge, and abdominal discomfort. In severe cases, the fever does not subside and there is stabbing pain in the chest and ribs. Medication should be given to quickly relieve wind-cold, promote sweating to reduce fever, and add blood-activating and Qi-regulating drugs, which should be effective. If the fever increases, then prevent the fever from entering the blood chamber, which can lead to mental confusion and delirium, and groping of clothes and bed. In this case, it is appropriate to add drugs to clear heat and promote blood circulation, and open the orifices to clear the mind, so that the fever will dissipate with the blood.</p>
<p>If a pregnant woman contracts winter warmth and has a high fever, and the pregnancy is six or seven months along, emergency measures should be taken to protect the fetus. The ancient method was to apply well-bottom mud to the abdomen, but now it can be changed to using water bags or cold water towels. Prescribe heat-clearing and pregnancy-stabilizing drugs, and urgently administer Coptis and Gypsum.</p>
<p>In postpartum fever, mild cases have fresh and purplish lochia, lower abdominal pain, chest tightness and headache. Severe cases have sudden cessation of lochia, mental confusion, and often exhibit air-grasping behavior, which is very frightening. At the onset, medication such as Angelica, Peach Kernel, Pangolin Scales, Raw Rehmannia, and Ligusticum wallichii should be used. In severe cases, administer Rhinoceros Horn, Moutan Bark, Honeysuckle, and Forsythia. There are also cases of rashes and eruptions, which are the most dangerous. Experienced physicians who are well-versed in the classics should administer medication according to the symptoms, which can lead to hope of escaping danger.</p>
<h3>General Discussion of Bone Diseases: Hunchback</h3>
<p>— Tao Muzhang</p>
<p>Bone tuberculosis is more common in children. Why is this so? Because children's bones are soft and fragile, and if they are injured, although they cry and wail, parents think it is an accidental fall and do not pay attention. They do not know that the injured area cannot recover immediately, and over time, the periosteum is damaged, forming a pus-filled bulge. The skin appears without swelling or pain. Also, after this disease ulcerates, it spreads east and west, moving without a fixed location. Therefore, the treatment of bone tuberculosis is different from other departments. The method of blocking the root must be used to stop its spread.</p>
<p>Moreover, after this disease ulcerates, there are many changes. The pus is clear and thin, like soy milk, like rotten water. Over time, the body's essence leaks out through this, and the complexion becomes pale, the appearance becomes withered, and there is afternoon fever, creating a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Our bones are like the steel structure of a house, and are extremely important and should not be tilted. The spine is like the main beam of a house, and is even more important. Hunchback, known in Western medicine as vertebral inflammation, is characterized by a slightly protruding back or a heavy back. This disease is caused by deficiency and exhaustion, and is called tuberculous spondylitis. In strong people, food enters the stomach and is transported to all parts of the body. The limbs and bones are strong and powerful. Once the disease occurs, all the abundant fluids and good nutrition are eroded by tuberculosis bacteria. The spinal cord cannot be generated. Moreover, these bacteria lie dormant deep within the affected area, initially eroding the bone spaces. By the time the periosteum is eroded, the trend has become the original cause. Therefore, the onset of this disease requires the most attention and should not be ignored. If you feel a slight heaviness in the waist, you should immediately consult a good orthopedist for surgery, and at the same time prescribe appropriate medication to strengthen the patient's resistance. Most importantly, protect the good bones around the decayed bone to prevent it from spreading, because treating disease is like fighting a fire. If the fire spreads, it will be impossible to save. Good firefighters often push down walls to suppress the fire, and the principle is the same. For other syphilitic and traumatic spondylitis, appropriate treatments should be applied, which will not be repeated here.</p>
<h3>Velvet Antler: A Potent Winter Tonic</h3>
<p>— Hu Guangxuan</p>
<p>Velvet antler is a well-known tonic in traditional Chinese medicine, and has been used for a long time. Winter is the most suitable time to take this tonic. According to research, it contains valuable velvet antler essence, which is actually an endocrine gland.</p>
<p>Velvet antler is the nascent antler of a deer, containing blood and not yet ossified, like a tender bud of grass, soft like an eggplant. The most famous ones come from Guandong. Generally speaking, if it is picked too young, the blood and qi will not be complete, and the actual strength will be small. If it is too old, the blood will be dry and the strength will be weak. It should be about four or five inches long, shaped like a forked saddle, and the end should be like agate red jade. The one that is purely blood is called a blood slice, and it has the best effect. The next best is the one that looks like a honeycomb, called a sand slice. The one that is connected to the bone and resembles a horn has the weakest effect.</p>
<p>Velvet antler is a potent tonic and strengthening medicine. It nourishes essence and blood, and strengthens muscles and bones. It is most suitable for people with a yang deficiency constitution. If it is taken improperly, taking a large amount all at once, or if the constitution is yin deficient, it often causes nosebleeds, vomiting blood, red eyes, dizziness, and other problems. It is advisable for a doctor to examine the suitability of the constitution, and then determine the amount to be taken. It is best to take a small amount at a time, and take it for several days.</p>
<h3>Shi Quan Da Bu Gao (Ten-Ingredient Tonic Paste)</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhihui</p>
<p>The efficacy of Chinese medicine is actually better than Western medicine, because it is suitable for the constitution of Chinese people. This is also true for tonics. This winter season is a good time for tonics. Those who are economically well-off should seek medical attention and prescribe a paste tonic, which is best suited to their constitution. The next best option is to buy and take Shi Quan Da Bu Gao, which is also quite suitable. In general, Shi Quan Da Bu Gao contains qi-tonifying and blood-tonifying herbs, such as ginseng, poria, atractylodes, licorice, angelica, rehmannia, white peony, ligusticum, astragalus, and cinnamon. When a person's qi and blood are sufficient, the body is strong. If there is fatigue or excessive thinking, the person will be thin, tired, and have tinnitus and dizziness. This paste greatly replenishes qi and blood, and has great effect.</p>
<h3>Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy</h3>
<p>— Cai Bochun</p>
<p>After a woman becomes pregnant for more than a month, she often experiences mild nausea and vomiting. This is called morning sickness, and it is a physiological change. Mild cases do not require medical treatment. To reduce its occurrence, simply pay attention to regulating the diet, eating foods that are easy to digest and nutritious, and avoiding irritating foods. Especially avoid foods that are usually disliked, otherwise they will easily cause vomiting. At leisure, engage in various pastimes and conversations to forget about it.</p>
<p>However, in severe cases of morning sickness, the nausea and vomiting gradually become severe, and even vomit with every drink and every meal. Even when the stomach is empty and there is nothing to vomit, the vomiting of yellow fluid does not stop. The mouth is dry, the lips are cracked, there are headaches and insomnia, there is no appetite, there is a lack of nutrition, and it can develop into a serious illness, which can cause miscarriage. Treatment should be given.</p>

<h3>Authorities Prepare to Sell Large Quantities of Food; Rice Market Inflation Expected to Be Curtailed; Social Affairs Bureau Investigates Inventory and Sales Volume of Rice Shops; Failure to Report Will Result in License Revocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Due to the continuous rainy weather, the amount of rice arriving at the market yesterday was relatively scarce, totaling 7,576.5 shi. The price of white japonica rice once soared to a new high of 980,000, but ended at 920,000, still 5,000 yuan lower than the previous day. According to Gu Mingqi, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, the market may continue to decline slightly today. The authorities have prepared a large quantity of rice of various kinds, which can be sold to the market when necessary. Once the weather clears up and the supply increases, the price of rice will fall.</p>
<p>In order to prevent merchants from hoarding grain and to understand the city's accurate needs so that the government can supply it, the Social Affairs Bureau has previously ordered all rice shops in the city to submit monthly reports on their incoming, outgoing, and inventory quantities. A total of 1,600 members of the Rice Shop Guild are registered in the city. Approximately one report was submitted in October and November. The Social Affairs Bureau initially plans to issue warnings to those who fail to comply with the order. If they continue to disobey, their licenses will be revoked.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales of Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 7,500 shi of rice and other grains arrived in the north and south markets. Shopkeepers found it difficult to sell at the high prices, and their appetite waned. The market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. In the end, japonica rice softened after a brief increase, while medium-grain rice saw its gains offset, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Glutinous rice also remained stable. Flour sales remained strong, and prices continued to rise. Wheat bran rose by 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales weakened, and prices plummeted near the close, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Yellow soybean sales were sluggish, and local merchants were not interested, as oil factories remained inactive, causing prices to fall by 10,000 yuan, or even 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Cowpeas remained stagnant, falling by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum sales were the most sluggish, with few buyers. Corn also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw weaker sales, and local merchants were bearish, with prices falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Tianjin has stopped exporting sesame seeds, and oil factories are not active, causing prices to fall by another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Black sesame seed sales were slow.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Declines Across the Board</h3>
<p>Soybean oil factory supplies were normal, and prices fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil both fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Clear oil also weakened, falling by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Although the supply of raw oil from Longhai has resumed, the supply from northern Jiangsu is not weak. There are also arrivals from Qingdao and central Shandong. Arrivals from the Yangtze River have increased slightly, resulting in supply exceeding demand, market sentiment softening, and prices plunging by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Active Sales of Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw tighter gains due to active sales. White sugar rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, reaching as high as 70,000 yuan. Brown and red sugar rose by varying amounts of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. The guild's posted prices were: 24 coarse white sugar spot cargo (large bags) at 1.33 million yuan, 20 Taichung granulated white sugar at 1.3 million yuan, Taichung red sugar at similar prices, No. 98 million yuan for Hainan Red sugar, and 1.3 million yuan for bag-packed high-quality Xinghua white sugar, 1.24 million yuan for basket-packed, Xinghua red sugar at 1.155 million yuan, and 940,000 yuan for Diao Qing. Later, another Star opened at 960,000 yuan, with a total of 1,500 pieces traded. It was heard that in the afternoon's unofficial trading, the price of white sugar eased slightly.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit and Sluggish Sales; Yarn and Cloth Prices Both Fall; Raw Cotton Prices Remain Firm Due to Strong Demand from Factories</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened with a slight decline and then rebounded slightly. Subsequently, due to sluggish demand from both local and external buyers and increasingly tight credit conditions, many merchants, burdened by cash flow problems, sold off their holdings, causing the market to decline. Towards the close, fabric manufacturers made some purchases at lower prices, causing the market to recover slightly. However, the closing price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was still 600,000 yuan lower than the previous day, at 48.4 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also fell by small amounts ranging from 100,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Market Declines</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened calmly, but subsequently, due to increasingly tight credit conditions, those burdened by cash flow problems frequently sold off their holdings, especially Shanxi merchants. There were few buyers in the market, resulting in supply exceeding demand and prices plummeting. Near the close, individual customers made scattered purchases, and retail investors bought at lower prices, stabilizing the market. In the end, the prices of 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths all fell by 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 yuan. Twill, straight tribute cloth, and bleached cloth prices also fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. However, the prices of colored cloth and serge cloth remained firm. In addition, demand from gray cloth umbrella factories was strong, and prices rose by about 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Prices Remain Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday's raw cotton prices remained firm. In recent days, due to tight credit conditions, transactions were limited, and the market fluctuated. However, due to limited supply and continued sales, yarn factory demand was strong. Therefore, despite the tight credit conditions, cotton yarn was used to exchange for raw cotton to facilitate transactions. Prices initially remained stable and then rose, but ultimately lacked momentum due to the softening of cotton yarn prices. A total of 700 bales, or 1,540 dan, were traded. The price for delivery to factories was 5.291 million yuan for Luoyang and 5.125 million yuan for Dazhongji. In addition, 540 dan of 20-count yarn were used to exchange for raw cotton on the yarn market, and 100 pieces of yarn were traded. 1,100 dan of Dazhongji were exchanged for raw cotton, and 200 pieces of yarn were traded. A total of 200 bales, or 1,540 dan, were traded at the port delivery price of 4.547 million yuan for yarn and 4.96 million yuan for Lingbao. Cottonseeds were priced at 940,000 yuan.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Company Sells Cloth</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 10,200 bolts. There were a total of 256 purchase orders, including 10 from manufacturers, purchasing 400 bolts, and 246 from cloth merchants, purchasing 9,800 bolts.</p>
<h3>The Consistent Decline of Silk Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market continued its ten-thousand-yuan decline, due to the payment for allocated goods being due on Thursday. Silk merchants had no interest in acquiring these goods, leading to weakened confidence. In the morning, the "旭" (Xu) brand, number 120, series 1A glossy rayon, opened at seven million yuan, but attracted no interest, closing at six million yuan in the afternoon. In the afternoon, due to extremely tight credit conditions, sellers were even more eager to sell, and prices fell steadily. The final offer was two million yuan, six million yuan lower than the previous day. Futures sales were around eighty million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Conditions</p>
<p>Market conditions were weakening, and yesterday's prices saw another decline. Due to the allocation of goods to smaller factories, transactions were infrequent. In the morning, a few "另担" (ling dan) were sold at a price of ninety million yuan, with four or five futures contracts. In the afternoon, prices declined further, with offers at eighty-nine million yuan, but no transactions. CD grade rayon was offered at around ninety-one to ninety-two million yuan, two million yuan lower than the previous day. "千经" (Qian Jing) also trended downward, with ordinary "另担" at around sixty-eight million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday's market saw mixed ups and downs. "眞丝" (Zhen Si) silk quilt covers from 华强 (Hua Qiang) opened at five million seven hundred thousand yuan with some transactions, but due to an imbalance in supply and demand, prices gradually declined, falling to a minimum of five million yuan. Some took advantage of the low prices to buy, leading to a rebound, with the closing price for immediate delivery at five million four hundred thousand yuan. "大诚" (Da Cheng) goods were at fifty-five million yuan, and "美亚" (Mei Ya) goods were at seventy million yuan. Rayon goods saw erratic prices due to falling raw material prices and extremely tight credit conditions. Ordinary 华锦 (Hua Jin) crepe was around seventy thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Further Exchange of Opinions Between the Textile Adjustment Committee and Private Yarn Mills</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, 表良 (Biao Liang), invited four heads of private yarn mills, 王啓字 (Wang Qizi), 唐星海 (Tang Xinghai), 荣尔仁 (Rong Erren), and 刘靖基 (Liu Jingji), for discussions around 4 PM yesterday. They engaged in further exchanges of views on the implementation plan for the management of cotton yarn and cloth. Mr. 袁 (Yuan) also instructed Mr. 王 (Wang) and others to inform member yarn mills belonging to the Six District Associations to promptly submit statistical data on each factory's cotton inventory, cotton requirements, yarn inventory, and cotton yarn production and sales, for record and verification purposes.</p>
<h3>Hope for Effective Crackdown on Adulteration of Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The cotton inspection bureaus in various provinces, originally established in our country, have been abolished due to the impact of years of war. As a result, the bad practice of adulterating cotton with water has become prevalent in various cotton-producing areas in recent years. The excellent cotton production is being wasted by human actions, leading to a decline in quality, which is regrettable. Various stakeholders in the cotton yarn industry hope that the responsible authorities will promptly restore the revenue collection offices in various cotton-producing areas and are actively working with the construction departments of various provinces to prepare for the restoration of inspection agencies. So far, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces have established cotton inspection institutes. The Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Inspection Institute has three inspection districts in Jiading, Pudong, and Tonghai, and has set up inspection stations in Taicang, Baoshan, Changshu, Zhoupu, and Haimen. The Zhejiang Provincial Inspection Institute is divided into two inspection districts in Ningbo and Xiaoshan, and has an inspection station in Yuyao. The Hubei Provincial Inspection Institute is divided into five inspection districts in Xiangfan, Suizao, Jingsha, Tianmen, and Eastern Hubei, and has set up inspection stations in Laohekou, Suixian, Jianli, and Xiantao. The Shaanxi Provincial Inspection Institute is divided into four inspection districts in Weinan, Jingyang, Chaoyi, and Xianyang, and has set up inspection stations in Huaxian, Sanyuan, Yongle, and Gaoling. The Henan Provincial Inspection Institute has set up the Zhengzhou Inspection District and has set up inspection stations in Kaifeng, Shangqiu, and Xinxiang. It is expected that after the active launch of inspection work, the quality of cotton production in various provinces will improve day by day.</p>
<p>In addition, the Cotton Production Revenue Collection Office promoted American cotton varieties in various provinces throughout the country this year, totaling 73,015 market dan. In the provinces of the Yellow River basin, varieties starting with "斯" (Si) are the most common. In the provinces of the Yangtze River basin, varieties starting with "德" (De) and "珂" (Ke) are the most common. Among the provinces promoting improved varieties, Jiangsu ranks first, with a total of 19,511 dan. Henan ranks second with 17,866 dan, and Hubei ranks third with 14,613 dan. The rest are all below 6,000 dan, with Jiangxi having the least at only 168 dan.</p>
<h3>Unprecedentedly Tight Credit Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, credit conditions were unprecedentedly tight, with black market interest rates as high as two jiao and seven fen or more. Some commercial firms and manufacturers felt it difficult to manage their cash flow. Yesterday, the Four Banks and Two Bureaus had a net inflow of 222.6 billion, with the Central Bank receiving 49.6 billion. Large-scale exchanges resulted in an outflow of 7.3 billion, and foreign banks had an inflow of 41.5 billion. Small-scale exchanges resulted in an outflow of 256.7 billion, with Chinese banks receiving 126.5 billion. Other banks and bureaus all had net inflows.</p>
<h3>Strict Investigation of Returned Checks by the Financial Management Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since its establishment last week, the Municipal Gold Exchange Management Bureau has been actively launching its work. It is paying particular attention to cracking down on returned checks from firms and the use of checks for same-day transactions. It is reported that the situation with returned checks did not clear until around 10 PM. This caused the positions of various firms at the exchange to be settled as late as 3 AM the next morning.</p>
<h3>Short-Lived Positive Momentum; Hua Shares Turn Weak in the Aftermarket</h3>
<p>The situation for Hua shares yesterday was volatile. The threat of tight credit conditions increased, and the investigation of accounts outside the market intensified. Although there was a temporary rebound due to the stimulus of small-cap stocks, 永纱 (Yong Sha) failed to surpass its previous high, and small-cap stocks also showed signs of exhaustion, so the positive momentum was not sustainable.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, due to extremely tight credit conditions, confidence was difficult to boost, and the market opened lower. 永舷梯 (Yong Xuan Ti) opened at 461 yuan and 470 yuan, and then fell further to 459 yuan and 464 yuan. 华丰 (Hua Feng) and 内衣 (Nei Yi) rose to the limit, and small-cap stocks were surprisingly popular, boosting confidence. Prices gradually rose to a high of 473 yuan for immediate delivery and 486 yuan for deferred delivery. Some took profits at the high prices, and the interest rate outside the market opened as high as three jiao and three jiao four fen, but there were still no buyers. 永纱 (Yong Sha) ultimately failed to maintain a stable upward trend for long and fell back to 451 yuan and 457 yuan. At this time, small-cap stocks still showed some positive performance, moving cautiously and steadily. Near noon, prices were forced down to a low of 448 yuan and 456 yuan, and then closed at 450 yuan and 457 yuan. 永业 (Yong Ye) suddenly rose to the limit. As a result, 华丰 (Hua Feng), the immediate delivery share compared to the previous close, rose to the limit and then rebounded slightly, up another 10%. 闸北内衣 (Zhabei Nei Yi) rose to the limit and then rebounded, rising slightly. 永业 (Yong Ye) rose to the limit, while 新华 (Xin Hua), 五和 (Wu He), and 中兴 (Zhong Xing) also rose by slightly less than 10%. 火柴 (Huochai) fell by half a percentage point, 中纺 (Zhong Fang) rose by half a percentage point, and 永纱 (Yong Sha), 中法 (Zhong Fa), 永公 (Yong Gong), 景纶 (Jing Lun), 商務 (Shang Wu), and 荣丰 (Rong Feng) fell slightly. 大通 (Da Tong) was flat, and the rest rose slightly. For deferred delivery shares, 华丰 (Hua Feng) and 景福 (Jing Fu) were still flat, 永纱 (Yong Sha) and 美亚 (Mei Ya) fell slightly, and 新光 (Xin Guang) and 信和 (Xin He) rose slightly.</p>
<p>In the aftermarket, numbers 112, 219, 160, 36, 65, 197, 8, and 83 were dumped, and rumors of a US$60 million loan resurfaced. The national banks had a significant net inflow in the exchange, and prices gradually fell to 447 yuan for immediate delivery and 448 yuan for deferred delivery. The number of buyers gradually increased, and the off-market price was again higher than the on-market deferred delivery price. Number 36 covered its short position, rising back to around 455 yuan and 465 yuan. Before the close, prices weakened again, closing at 454 yuan and 457 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, 中纺 (Zhong Fang) fell by 10%, 勤兴 (Qin Xing) and 景纶 (Jing Lun) fell by less than half a percentage point, 中法 (Zhong Fa) and 永公 (Yong Gong) were flat, and the rise and fall of the remaining shares were slight. 华丰 (Hua Feng) fell by half a percentage point for tear delivery shares, 永纱 (Yong Sha) was flat, and the rest fell slightly. Off-market, old shares like 大生 (Da Sheng) rebounded by half a percentage point, and the rest were stable.</p>
<h3>Continued Rise in Unified Bonds; Foreign Shares Uneventful</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to trend upward yesterday, with approximately seven million yuan traded. Numbers 555 and 552 rose, while numbers 500 and 360 declined. Unified Class C opened at 33,500 yuan, peaked at 34,500 yuan, and bottomed at 32,700 yuan, and then formed a consolidation pattern. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B rose by 2,100, Class C rose by 2,400, Class D rose by 1,800, and Class E rose by 1,200.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign shares weakened due to non-business-related stimuli, and buyers were cautious and defeated. However, the trading volume was not large, and the process was uneventful. 怡纱 (Yi Sha) started at 425,000 yuan and fell slightly to around 410,000 yuan at the close. Compared to the previous close, 怡纱 (Yi Sha), 英联会 (Ying Lian Hui), 德丰 (De Feng), paper, steel, and telephone shares each fell by half a percentage point. 怡啤 (Yi Pi), shipping, tram, 祥泰 (Xiang Tai), 自来火 (Zi Lai Huo), and rubber shares each fell by 10%, and the advertising industry fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Increased Factory Prices; Soap Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the market for daily-use soaps, due to rumors that the Huang Xiangmao factory would increase its prices to 820,000 yuan for allocation, traders in the market were active, and demand from all parties was surprisingly strong, leading to soaring prices. As a result, 固本 (Gu Ben) soap surged by 130,000 yuan to 1,110,000 yuan. 箭刀 (Jian Dao) soap rose by 120,000 yuan to 1,080,000 yuan. Huang Xiangmao soap rose by 100,000 yuan, and other soaps were also firm.</p>
<h3>Agreed on Markup for More Than Twenty Kinds of Steel</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The meeting of the Review Committee on Goods Imported by the China Trust Bureau Using Self-Provided Foreign Exchange was held for the eighth time yesterday. In addition to the purchase price of paper, which has been decided to be 55% above the landed price, the markup issues for more than 20 kinds of steel have been separately agreed upon. After reaching an agreement with various importers tomorrow, it will be announced. The allocation contract format has also been drafted. It is reported that the next review meeting will discuss the markup issues for forest materials and hardware.</p>
<h3>Fragmented Woolen Fabric Transactions; Only Paris Fabric Had Transactions</h3>
<p>The prices for woolen fabrics mostly remained the same yesterday, and transactions were mostly fragmented. Those with tight positions rushed to sell due to the approaching New Year. Conversely, those with ample cash were looking to buy on the dips, but mostly limited to Paris, Van Lideing, and Chunhua fabrics. Recently, the transaction price for top-grade Paris fabric was 750,000 yuan per yard, and second-grade was 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Tea Market Trends Upward</p>
<p>Yesterday's tea market: Transactions remained lacking in actual volume, due to the continued impact of cloudy and rainy weather. Buyers continued to remain on the sidelines, while sellers' sentiments were firmer than the previous day. Furthermore, asking prices gradually increased, so the market sentiment was more bullish.</p>

<h3>A Little Knowledge of Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Dai Bufan</p>
<p>Lu Xun's "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction," page 231 (Beixin Fifth Edition): "Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times" in twenty-two volumes, titled "Edited by the Master of the East Wall Mountain Studio," contains Po Lingwei's work, including four articles from "Stories to Awaken the World" (Fifteen Strings of Cash: A Joke Turns into a Major Disaster; Chen Duo's Life and Death Marriage; Zhang Shu'er's Ingenious Escape from Yang Sheng; Liu Xiaoguan, Brothers and Sisters in Drag), another article is "The Mei Islet Regret" from "Tales of West Lake," the origins of the rest are not detailed. There are two points in this section that seem to require supplementation:</p>
<p>1. Volume 17 of "Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times," "Wu Baoan Repays His Benefactor by Forgetting His Family," is divided into two parts. The first part tells the story of Wu Bao, and the second part narrates the story of Liu Sheng. "Wu Baoan Abandons His Family to Redeem His Friend" originally comes from "Ancient and Modern Novels" and was also included in "Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times," but after being changed to "Repays His Benefactor by Forgetting His Family" by the "Master of the East Wall Mountain Studio," many parts were deleted and altered. This point may have been an oversight by Lu Xun when writing the book?</p>
<p>2. Volume 15 of "Strange Tales," "Scholars Without Integrity and Wealth Living Lowly," is an abridged adaptation of Volume 8 of "Stone Nodding," "A Greedy Man Sells Romance in Six Courtyards." In "Stone Nodding," the greedy official is named Wu Shoutao, meaning to become Tao Zhugong; in "Strange Tales," he is named He Youzhi, which also has a hidden meaning. I have read both texts and found that many sentences are the same (the text is long, not recorded). The plots are also roughly the same. The biggest difference is that after Wu Shoutao opened a brothel, a Wang merchant came to prostitute in the six courtyards and wrote a poem in each courtyard ridiculing and retaliating, while "Strange Tales" omits this; Wu Shoutao's death was due to a sudden fainting and possession by a vengeful spirit; Gai Youzhi's death was due to implication in a theft case, being beaten, and the unfilial behavior of his children, which made him faint and see ghosts.</p>
<p>In addition to the five articles pointed out by Lu Xun, we can now clearly identify the source of one more and "half" of the twenty-two volumes of "Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times." If we continue to search, perhaps we can find more?</p>
<h3>The Feeling of Ci Poetry</h3>
<p>— Wang Mengou</p>
<p>Some literary works seem to require the embodiment of language, often gathering a large number of nouns in the organization of the text, with many places like listing a grocery store's inventory, or like a furniture catalog. The author uses these embodied object names to simplify the process of the reader accepting the author's emotions expressed in the sentences. Furthermore, the appropriate coordination of nouns representing different objects will sometimes mutually reflect another associative image and feeling.</p>
<p>In fact, this effect was used earlier in poetry. The author uses the sublimation of feeling to transfer emotions to the realm of poetry. No matter how sublime the expected poetic realm is, its foundation cannot escape the experience of general senses. In other words, the author wants to use poetry to guide people into the realm of super-experience, and sometimes uses that general experience as a bridge. For example, "red rain" is beyond our experience, but Li He has: "Peach blossoms fall in disorder like red rain." Here, the general experience of peach blossoms falling in disorder is used to create a new image, and this new image and general experience mutually reflect the poetic realm expected by the author.</p>
<p>In the problem of "fu bi xing" (direct presentation, analogy, and allegory) discussed in Chinese poetics, any sentence that uses words such as "ru" (like), "si" (similar), "ruo" (as if), etc., roughly falls within the scope of "bi" (analogy). For example, Su Shi's "Old friends are each in a corner of the sky, looking at each other sparsely like morning stars." The sparse situation cannot be explained, so the general experience of the steadfastness of morning stars is used to reflect the realm of poetry and save countless unnecessary and non-specific descriptions. However, since this borrows embodied nouns to carry out the poetry of expressing emotions, many of the words such as "ru," "si," and "ruo" can be omitted. For example, Bai Juyi's "Song of Painting Bamboo": "The seven stalks on the west are strong and healthy, I remember seeing them on the rocks in front of the Tianzhu Temple; the eight stalks on the east are sparse and cold, I remember seeing them in the rain in the Xiangfei Temple." Here, the author's feelings of strength and health, and sparseness and coldness, two different states of bamboo, are to be expressed through general experience. Thus, there are concrete analogies of bamboo in front of the Tianzhu Temple on rocks and bamboo in the rain in the Xiangfei Temple. Even though we have no impression of the Tianzhu Temple and the Xiangfei Temple, temples and bamboo on rocks, and bamboo in the rain are always generally experienced. With this foundational experience, we can reflect the emotions of strength and health, and sparseness and coldness intended by the author.</p>
<p>However, this still uses embodied nouns to achieve the embodiment of abstract ideas. In addition, some things are originally embodied and are expressed with embodied nouns, such as Chuan Xuan's "The beauty is so beautiful, her face is like a lotus flower." This uses the lotus flower from general experience to make the beauty even more embodied. Also, such as Yue Jianwen's "Fifteen is somewhat more, the sun shines on the apricot beam for the first time," and Du Mu's "Graceful and slender, a little over thirteen, like a budding cardamom in the second month." Here, although we have no impression of the apricot beam and cardamom, the first sun on the apricot beam and the flower tips in the second month, the feelings contained in this kind of experience must be general. Therefore, we can be guided from embodied nouns into the author's intention and feeling. The same applies to using animal nouns as using plant nouns. Wang Anshi's "Clumsy horses, satisfied, vie for the road; overturned carts and hungry horses are not idle," and "Weak roots on the main road know it is difficult to plant, tired wings for many years want to fly away." Here, what people experience are animals or plants, but what they feel are people. There is also the opposite of this, such as Chen Qufei's "Camellia Flower Poem": "Green skirt and white face, first acquaintance, in the tenth month the camellia flower road opens." This uses our experience of women with simple and elegant green skirts and white faces to guide the author's emotions towards the camellia flower in the tenth month. Although this has the same effect as comparing people to flowers and comparing flowers to people, the nouns joined by "white face" and "green skirt" are still not concrete enough. Such as Bai Juyi's "Pear Blossom Poem": "Most told is a young widow in her boudoir, in white makeup, plain face, and green gauze skirt." This uses the coordination of embodied nouns such as white makeup, plain face, and green gauze skirt to save the embodiment of the widow, and then uses this very embodied feeling of a widow to guide us into the author's emotion towards the pear blossom. In this case, the lines about camellia flowers may be derived from the lines about pear blossoms. But in any case, the lines about pear blossoms are always more approachable because their creation is based on more general experience.</p>
<p>Our imagination is often limited to the scope of experience. Without experience, it is difficult to imagine. It is only a complex of experiences with different individuals. Literary works use the coordination of embodied nouns to achieve a so-called super-experience of poetic realm, or follow this reason. However, the nouns of objects often differ with time and space, and this space-time difference will become the sediment of experience, sometimes making experience lose its effect. Such as Li Shangyin's "Golden cicada lock burns incense to enter, jade tiger pulls silk to draw well water." What are golden cicada and jade tiger? We must wait for annotations and wait to sweep away the sediment of experience before we can imagine. But, such as Wen Tingyun's "Rough waves float on jasper steps, sunny sun shines on colorful flags," what are rough waves? If we have no experience of it, then it is just a dead cell in the poem.</p>
<p>However, the above examples are to use embodied description to emphasize feeling. A further step than this is to purely use the piling up of nouns to complete the sensory lines, such as Li Shangyin's "Sui Palace Poem": "Now the rotten grass has no fireflies, forever the deserted willows have evening crows," using rotten grass, fireflies, deserted willows, and evening crows to brew a feeling of ruins in order to convey the lament that human affairs are most impermanent. But these nouns are still not independent enough to be used. A further step than this is such as: "Lone sound, thatched cottage, moon; human tracks, frozen plank bridge, frost." Or "Two lines of tears under the lamp, a piece of Lingnan letter," or "Pear blossom courtyard, dissolving moon; willow pond, faint wind"; lines of this kind are purely a concrete arrangement of nouns, and each sentence can independently produce a complex feeling.</p>
<p>Sunshine and Xie Zi</p>
<p>A child fell ill, and was drowsy and spitting constantly. Except for the time to take medicine, he was almost always drowsy and unconscious. After several days of this, in his mother's anxiety and his own drowsiness, his fever finally subsided, and he felt awake. Casting aside a string of disordered dreams, perhaps also carrying some lingering traces of dreams, he opened his eyes and found, or rather, remembered that it was a spring morning. The sun, carrying a warm aura, shone in through the window. This radiance was reflected by the low-hanging curtains into blue shadows; was cast into gold by the small copper rods; was melted into white snow by the handkerchief his mother wore on her lapel. In these three colors, he began to pay attention to his mother's face--after several days of staying up all night, his mother was somewhat haggard, but this haggard could not hide her youth, even more so could it not hide the radiance of a mother's love. She seemed to be thinking, thinking about her child, why he was always drowsy, why he wouldn't wake up sooner... But suddenly turning her head, she found that her child was already awake, and so a hint of joyful smile covered her face. She leaned down, stroked his forehead with her hand, and asked him questions, but the child didn't say a word, somewhat blankly, because at this time, in his heart, in his eyes, there was only a patch of happy sunshine!</p>
<h3>Woodcuts of the Ming Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Jin Dong</p>
<p>The picture on the right is one of the "Water Margin Leaves," painted by Chen Hongshou (Laolian) of Zhuji, Ming Dynasty, and engraved by Huang Zili of Xin'an. This type of print was probably popular in the Ming Dynasty as illustrations for short plays, and the images attached to works such as the Water Margin and the Romance of the West Chamber are particularly excellent, not only accurate and vivid in composition, but also extremely exquisite and powerful in engraving technique. They are indeed an important period in the history of Chinese woodcut art. "Leaves" were tools for gambling since the Tang and Song Dynasties, and became "Ma Diao" after the Tianqi period of the Ming Dynasty. The upper end of the northern "leaves" still has the words "two hundred thousand guan," which is probably still the form of paper money.</p>
<h3>Describing Characters</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Mengwu</p>
<p>In describing characters, for me, the most important thing is to grasp the most characteristic subtle points, which can immediately make the character come alive. Long dialogues are unnecessary--three or two sentences of personalized words, a few typical words that fit the character and have muscle, are enough to succinctly bring out the character.--(Gladkov)</p>
<h3>Recent World Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Twenty-Fifth Death Anniversary of Korolenko</p>
<p>Recently, a photo of Vladimir Korolenko suddenly appeared in Soviet newspapers, with a gray beard, a high forehead, thick hair combed back, and kind eyes that penetrated people's hearts. This photo commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of Korolenko's death.</p>
<p>Moscow held a solemn memorial meeting for Korolenko. The audience included workers, students, writers, artists, and scientists. The meeting began with a speech by the writer Gorbachev. Then Professor Belchikov spoke about Korolenko's life and works. The actor Vsevolod Aksenov recited excerpts from Korolenko's diary.</p>
<p>Korolenko's literary heritage is preserved in the Lenin State Library in Moscow. In 1938, the author's daughter donated the author's manuscripts to the library for preservation. A total of sixty-eight volumes were collected, including Korolenko's autograph signatures, original manuscripts, proofs, and several corrected copies of "The Story of My Contemporary." He began writing this manuscript in 1906 and continued until his death. There is also a manuscript of his famous novel, "The Blind Musician." This book also has two Chinese translations by Zhang Yaquan and Zhang Wentian. Even after the publication of this book, Korolenko continued to revise it, adding new sections and various corrections.</p>
<p>Among the collected manuscripts, there is also an unprinted "Queer Girl," which is about strong and fearless revolutionary women. He wrote it in prison in 1880 and it was banned by the Tsar's men. It was not published for the first time until after 1905.</p>
<p>Due to this novelist's death, he was unable to complete his book about Emelyan Pugahev. The book is titled "Insurgent Tsar." The manuscript is also housed in the Lenin Library. The author's notes from 1879 to 1900 are also housed in this library.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Ibram Deman's "Biography of Korolenko" has also been published by the Moscow Children's Literature Publishing House. Korolenko was the last of the famous pre-revolutionary Russian writers and a leader of the democratic movement in the 1870s. Gao Zangji called this elder brother someone who walked "a heroic and difficult road." He was imprisoned in the Vyshnevolotsk political prisoner jail and the Tobolsk artillery tower. He was also often exiled to remote places. Even before he became famous, he was often followed by secret agents and often interrogated. Although he was a kind and sensitive person and family man, he was often an enemy of the Tsar.</p>
<p>Derman had visited Korolenko many times and knew him very well. He was the first to write such a complete and popular biography. This book reveals his knowledge of Korolenko's childhood and student days.</p>
<p>Before he was 25 years old, Korolenko and other students protested against the school authorities for assisting the military police in searching for "politically untrustworthy" students, and was therefore exiled for the first time in 1876. His farthest exile was to Sloboda Amgu in 1881, because he refused to drink a toast to Tsar Alexander III.</p>
<p>Dahlman details Korolenko's life in Siberia, saying that he worked as a farmer and shoemaker, while using the keen eyes of an artist to study the life of the local people.</p>
<p>The publication of a collection of short stories about life in Siberia ("Makar's Dream" and others) and "The Blind Musician" were major events in Korolenko's life. Korolenko's works often speak of his hatred for the Tsar, and in court he defended the peasants.</p>
<p>Dahlman writes in detail about Korolenko's friendship with Chekhov, Gorky, and others. The book includes several letters from Gorky to Korolenko, which show his respect for this elder brother.</p>
<h3>Continued Notes and Interpretations from Zhang Chao's "You Meng Ying"</h3>
<p>— Lü Lianggeng</p>
<p>Writing couplets together, discussing essays intimately, composing poems for the imperial court, and serving as envoys to tributary states are all the ultimate joys of life.</p>
<p>One more thing should especially be added: "Extensively viewing famous flowers."</p>
<p>For a military man not to engage in reckless battles is to possess the literary quality within military pursuits. For a scholar not to be pedantic is to possess the martial spirit within literary endeavors.</p>
<p>A soldier dying in battle, a scholar dying in remonstration—once turbid emotions surge, acting rashly, there's utterly nothing to be done.</p>
<p>Attain concentration through discipline; from concentration, attain attachment. Gradually approaching the natural state through effort; refining essence to transform it into energy; refining energy to transform it into spirit. What dregs or impurities could there be in purity and emptiness?</p>
<p>A grand and clear state of mind, yet expressed in simple language. The essence of an entire Buddhist scripture is exhausted in these few words.</p>
<p>Discipline oneself with an autumn air; handle affairs with a spring air.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Cai's poem says: "Having experienced the solemnity of autumn descending upon the world, daring to leave spring's warmth on the tip of my brush." It's precisely the opposite situation.</p>
<p>The style of poetry and prose is best when it possesses an autumn air. The style of lyrics and songs is best when it possesses a spring air.</p>
<p>It is even better to be able to blend both airs, expanding and contracting, yielding and controlling as desired. Only by possessing both styles and interweaving the two airs can one achieve the combined beauty of strength and tenderness.</p>
<p>It is best to view a woman's morning makeup after she has applied powder. (Continued sentence) It is best to view a woman's evening makeup before she removes it.</p>
<p>I wonder if in a previous life, during the Spring and Autumn period, I ever knew Xi Shi? During the Jin Dynasty, did I ever see Wei Jie? During the Yi Xi era, did I ever get drunk with Yuanming? During the Tianbao era, did I ever behold Tai Zhen? During the Yuanfeng reign, did I ever meet Dongpo? Throughout the ages, those longed for are not limited to these few. But these few are the most prominent. Therefore, I mention them to represent the rest.</p>
<p>Limitless infatuation, truly a heartrending utterance that moves even stubborn beings. Yet, "The same heart feels the same emotions for thousands of years." It is not necessary to meet face to face, nor to pour out one's heart with sincerity. Hearts have long resonated, and spirits have understood.</p>
<p>I also wonder if, during the Longqing and Wanli periods, I ever socialized with several courtesans in the myriad courtyards? Did Mei Gong, Bohu, Ruoshi, and the gentlemen of Chishui ever share laughter and conversation with me? In the vast universe, whom should I ask now?</p>
<p>The heart connects with the divine; why bother lamenting being born in different eras? The mind's fast is truly for the infatuated!</p>
<p>Flowers should not be seen as they fall. The moon should not be seen as it sinks. Beautiful women should not be seen as they decline.</p>
<p>Endless infatuation, limitless tenderness—truly the heartfelt expressions of a talented individual with piercing insight.</p>
<h3>### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Dongfeng</p>
<p>Pingzi's words, however, wounded Tsurumi's dignity: "A dignified man, actually needing a woman to protect him!" He thought, only then recovering from the confusion caused by Pingzi's antics, and regaining his senses; recognizing that Pingzi's car was not taking him to the New Green Building, but speeding towards the outskirts; under the streetlights, he could barely see cars, horses, or pedestrians.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, Pingzi?" Tsurumi raised a hand, pressing it on Pingzi's jade arm.</p>
<p>"Taking you to the Taisei Shrine, Big Brother!" Pingzi's tone seemed "a matter of course," as if Tsurumi's question was redundant.</p>
<p>"No!" Tsurumi, like a lion just awakened, shook his head and roared: "I don't need to go to any shrine... Just let me out of the car, Nakamura, Sister!" As he spoke, he increased the force on his arm, forcibly turning the steering wheel, causing the car to swerve off the road and almost onto the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Be patient, Big Brother!" Pingzi gently extended her fair wrist, using a maneuver to break free of Tsurumi's arm. She straightened the steering wheel, and the car returned to its path, while she still calmly and peacefully said: "If you don't believe me, please turn around and look at what it's like on the road we came from!" Pingzi, even in this instance, did not speak with a smile.</p>
<p>At this moment, Tsurumi was quite surprised; he never knew that such a delicate and graceful Pingzi had such great strength; with a light flick, she had actually shaken off his arm. Although the force wasn't fierce, it had a hidden strength, an irresistible hidden strength. It's clear that the previous time they first met, when Pingzi sent a message with her fingers in the car, asking Tsurumi to teach her jujutsu, it was simply a joke. (See Chapter Six).</p>
<p>The second thing that alarmed Tsurumi was that he heard the words "what it's like on the road we came from" spoken so seriously. He indeed turned his head and looked out the rear window; for a moment, he forgot that there was someone sitting on the back seat, blocking his view; although he didn't see his back, he saw on the rear of the car, besides the "08" boar, another young woman sitting. That woman happened to be looking down into the car at that moment—perhaps because the car had almost driven onto the sidewalk just now. Under the bright streetlights, it was clear that the woman's face was tightly drawn, as if holding back anger. However, she was a stranger whom Tsurumi had never seen before.</p>
<p>What surprised Tsurumi even more was that he turned his head, peered out the window, and looked behind the car; he saw a convertible car on this road, speeding after them from a distance of about two hundred meters. Five or six strong men were sitting in the car; although the distance was too far, and he couldn't see their features clearly, judging by their appearance, it was clear that they were standard samurai.</p>
<p>"Hey, who on earth are they?" Tsurumi muttered to himself.</p>

<p>Free Discussions</p>
<h3>On "Life in this World"</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Wu Shichang had an article on "Observation," discussing the clichés in compositions by middle school and college students, mostly beginning with phrases like "The wheels of time..." and "Since the War of Resistance..." It's just like twenty years ago, when middle school students would start with "Life in this world" and "Between the two great events of life." Mr. Wu calls this a reflection of accumulated psychological pressure.</p>
<p>Thinking about it carefully, even being able to produce such clichés is already good, because at least there's a "tune" to it. In reality, today's middle school student compositions start with "grammatical errors." What can we even talk about in terms of "style" or "tune"! Some people complain that perhaps if things continue like this for another thirty years, no one in China will be able to write a coherent sentence in their own language. Whether this is true or not, we'll have to wait and see in thirty years, but there's no way to know for sure right now, so I'll stop worrying about it. Instead, let's talk about the origins of these so-called clichés.</p>
<p>Saying that middle school student compositions are clichés is actually unfair. We should start by looking at the speeches, talks, and press conferences of important people. Even a convicted corrupt official, when taking office, loudly proclaimed the need to reduce the burden on the people, didn't he? It was even more incredible when it came to cracking down on hoarding, punishing unscrupulous merchants, and suppressing smuggling. Almost every day, there were "high-minded arguments" taking up large chunks of newspaper space that no one wanted to read and no one believed. Aren't these the same as "Life in this world"? The person reading the composition gets a headache when they see "the wheels of time," but they still have to grit their teeth and keep reading. Ordinary people, however, aren't obligated to do this. They just toss the newspaper aside, or pick it up and flip straight to the "social news," paying attention to stories about Zhang Chunfan, the double-gun bandit, getting married in the air, and so on. —The rise of small newspapers is precisely because of this.</p>
<p>In the past, people used the eight-legged essay as a stepping stone. Once the door was open, the brick was thrown away. Nowadays, these newly emerging eight-legged essays are not stepping stones. Opening the door requires other, more effective tools. Just the brick alone definitely won't work. So, what is it? It turns out to be advertising, or a smokescreen, or, as they say in Beijing, "selling ointment." However, advertising is "believe it or not, buy it or not, it's up to you." There's complete freedom. The eight-legged essay, however, is persistently insistent. You not only have to accept it, but you also have to say it's "absolutely the best."</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The grass bends to the wind." Those above like something, and those below must like it even more. The great men are selling their own ointment in this way, and students naturally and unconsciously keep turning the wheels of time. But these are the great men of the future. When their era comes, won't they be forever selling that same all-powerful but utterly ineffective water-based ointment in an endless cycle?</p>
<p>Alas! "Life in this world..."</p>
<h3>Having Tea with George Bernard Shaw</h3>
<p>— Daoxian</p>
<p>Maurice Evans, a Broadway stage director and actor, visited George Bernard Shaw in England not long ago to discuss royalties for staging Shaw's romantic comedy "Man and Superman" in the United States. Although Shaw was ninety-one years old, he was still energetic, his voice full of strength and beauty. He spoke at length with Evans about drama, acting, and Truman and Wallace. After returning to the United States, Evans wrote an article, "Having Tea with Shaw," which was published in the "This Week Magazine" section of the New York Herald Tribune.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw lived in Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire. He had printed a route map specifically for visiting guests. It told you which road to take from London, where to go north, then turn left, go through a small road, then turn right, and so on, stating that it would take an hour and a quarter to get to Shaw's house from London. Evans clutched this map tightly in his hand, turning left and right, getting completely disoriented, and finally took more than two and a half hours to arrive. If it hadn't been for the warm, welcoming smile of the small Irish maid who opened the door, he would have almost suspected that this twisting and turning road was one of Shaw's pranks.</p>
<p>After being announced by Shaw's secretary, Miss Patch, Shaw walked out of his study, his face covered with a white beard as stiff as porcupine quills. He was leaning on a cane. Shaw's eyes were deeply sunken, but under his thick eyebrows, they still flashed with a mocking light. The red pigment in his hair and beard seemed to have gathered on his nose now, making him look a bit like the clown he called himself. His clothing also still showed a kind of personality: an old green tweed jacket, knee-length breeches.</p>
<p>Evans followed Shaw to the living room. To his surprise, Shaw's house was small and a bit uncomfortable. The living room was cluttered with antiques and furniture, showing that its owner was too busy and deeply lacked extravagance.</p>
<p>The Irish maid brought in tea, but Shaw had a large cup of strange beverage in front of him. It was a cold, rainy day, and Evans and Shaw sat close to a small portable electric heater to warm themselves. From this, one can see the difficult situation in Britain today; even a figure like Shaw, only because of his old age, was granted special permission to use such a small electric heater. The room where Shaw worked used to be heated very warmly, but now he could only use this small electric heater to warm himself, and he always kept the heater so close to his side that the housekeeper often worried that the blanket on his lap would catch fire.</p>
<p>"You want to stage 'Man and Superman'," Shaw suddenly said. Evans was caught off guard and was so surprised that he almost dropped his teacup. "Good, you can perform it, but you have to remember—you must stage it quickly. Although this play has always been a hit, I don't want it to be staged in the United States during a presidential election year. —You know, the competition is too fierce."</p>
<p>Evans took the opportunity to ask Shaw for his opinion on the 1948 American presidential candidates.</p>
<p>He said, "It's hard to say. Truman and Attlee are the same. They have done much better than we initially expected. However, since the war, among the Americans who have come to Britain, only Wallace's conversations have not been as mediocre as a villager."</p>
<p>Evans felt that this was Shaw's strategy to provoke a debate, so he didn't continue. He got back to the topic and asked Shaw for his opinion on royalties.</p>
<p>Shaw suddenly seemed tense as he sat in his chair, saying with an Irish accent, "Everyone asks for a lot of money from the theater. I have not changed my conditions for fifty years, and they are unchangeable." (Note: Shaw's royalty rate is 15% of the ticket price.)</p>
<p>Regarding the staging of his plays, Shaw made a definitive statement: "Modern actors are afraid to perform my plays."</p>
<p>Shaw probably meant that actors are afraid to recite the lines in his plays, because Shaw writes his plays in rhyming prose, which is almost poetry.</p>
<p>After signing the contract, Shaw sent Evans off bareheaded in the rain, fully revealing the warmth of this literary giant.</p>
<h3>Seriousness</h3>
<p>— Naizi</p>
<p>A prisoner escaped from a jail in a certain small town in the United States. The local police chief immediately sent six photos of the escaped prisoner in different poses to the police chief of a neighboring town. A few hours later, he received a reply stating:</p>
<p>"Five of the escaped prisoners have been captured. Expected sixth prisoner can be apprehended within a few hours."</p>
<h3>Between Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Jieding</p>
<p>In the past few days, the Chao Hui Villa has seen a tragic scene of living people seizing houses from the dead. Groups of refugees broke into the villa, moved away the coffins of the dead, and moved in themselves, numbering over a thousand. As a result, some people thought that the ancestors were not at peace and felt that the refugees were unreasonable.</p>
<p>According to traditional Chinese ethical concepts, when parents died, sons were required to "live in a hut" for three years by their parents' graves in the wilderness, abandoning all affairs of the living to accompany the dead in "sleeping." The dead were so much more important than the living. Even today, the phrase "parents' burial has not yet been settled" can cause children to lose their appetite and sleep, making it impossible for them to "live" properly. When a person is born, the parents do their best to raise the child, and they can even hit and scold the child to vent their anger. But when it comes to the dead (including one's own dead children), there must be no disrespect. They must be respectful, lying in state for three days, put in a coffin, the burial site must be selected, and the grave must be dug, and there must be sacrifices and celebrations for the deceased... Some people even spend their entire fortune on funerals, leaving the living unable to survive. Judging from this degree of importance attached to the dead, it is certainly an unforgivable crime for the living to seize the houses of the dead.</p>
<p>But even if people value the dead so much, this world is still the world of the living. On Nanjing Road, people rushing around in offices and exchanges, setting up stalls, filing lawsuits, begging from door to door, are all living people. If a dead person were found moving, it would simply be a world-shattering event.</p>
<p>Looking at the land in the countryside, especially in the suburbs, the amount of land occupied by burial mounds is enormous. In the cities, the houses of associations and villas are better than those of the poor and destitute, who have nowhere to live, sleeping on the streets with crying children and wives, which is heartbreaking to see. Compared to the comfort of the dead, it is a great irony.</p>
<p>For the living to live a decent life—at least to have a basic condition for survival—the rich should give up some of their excessive luxury to help the poor survive, let alone the dead?</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk about Shop Signs</h3>
<p>— Yifeng</p>
<p>When a villager suddenly steps into a "modernized" metropolis, especially places like Beijing and Shanghai, the feeling of novelty they experience is no less than that of Granny Liu entering the Grand View Garden. The most obvious things, such as the colorful neon lights, the long queues of people waiting for buses, and the sales slogans like "Great Discounts" and "Big Sacrifices"... all give them the feeling of being "overwhelmed by the sights along the road."</p>
<p>Especially those sales slogans like "Great Discounts" and the extraordinarily exaggerated advertisements with beautiful women, the attraction to a villager is indeed quite large, perhaps leading them to reluctantly spend their money, becoming a so-called "bumpkin" once, twice, or three times. However, those who are a little more discerning will realize that these are nothing but the merchants' beautiful lies, just "shop signs." Because "pursuing a tenth of profit" is every merchant's natural law. No one will do business at a loss, and no one is willing to be a fool who truly makes a "big sacrifice" that "doesn't spare the capital." Therefore, those who display "Great Discounts" are just doing that sort of thing. In this way, the term "shop sign" unconsciously becomes a disguised way of "creating falsehoods" in the general public's subconscious. In reality, it's quite an unfair thing.</p>
<p>What is a "shop sign"? Tracing back to its origins, everyone knows that it's a tool used by merchants to attract customers and promote goods. Its role is absolutely not limited to advertisements that exaggerate to the extreme. In ancient times, it was mostly used to showcase the actual goods in an honest and straightforward manner. Today, in some old commercial towns and cities, this practice of using real objects as shop signs still exists, especially in the northern towns. However, even in the modernized metropolises, traces of it still remain. For example, utensil stores hanging actual objects like pots and pans in front of their doors, comb stores hanging large wooden combs on their eaves, and clock and watch stores and shoe stores hanging wooden clock faces and boot pictures on their eaves. These physical and symbolic "shop signs" are, of course, very old-fashioned in the eyes of those who think they are outdated; however, their role is still to make it clear to customers at a glance. Although it is silent on the surface, without flowery advertisements, it also won't incur the hatred of those who have been deceived by advertising!</p>
<p>However, once this "shop sign" that originated in the commercial field spreads to corners outside the commercial field, it becomes a great misfortune. Moreover, in today's world where the wind of "spreading falsehoods" is rampant, the wonderful use of "shop signs" has greatly increased. How can one not be surprised that those who "hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat" are everywhere?</p>
<h3>Getting Promoted Like This</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>When Emperor Muzong of Tang was the crown prince, he heard that Li Ting had a fine horse, but he couldn't get it. When he ascended the throne, he said, "Li Ting didn't give me his horse, so his integrity is clear and he can be trusted." He then appointed him as a general. The History of Ming Dynasty mentions that when Yang Pu was prime minister, his son came from Shishou and described the gifts and hospitality he received from the officials of the counties he passed through. Only Fan Li, the magistrate of Jiangling, was not very polite. Pu was surprised and later learned of his virtue. He was then appointed to be the prefect of De'an Prefecture and then promoted to the position of Chief Administrator of Guizhou. Someone advised Li to write a letter of thanks, but Li said, "The prime minister is using people for the court, not for personal reasons. What is there to thank?" Later, upon hearing of Pu's death, he held a sacrifice and mourned for him to thank him for understanding him. Such appointments, based on words and character, all came from purity and without any bias, and are all worthy of emulation by later generations. Especially the case of giving favor to those who don't give to me is rare throughout history, both at home and abroad, which is why it is so difficult. But if this were to happen today, it would likely be labeled as a "big deal". As for the South History: Biography of Liu Jinyi, it roughly says, "Yuan Xing was base and vulgar, but he was intimate with Emperor Xiaowu. The Emperor doted on Consort Yin, who died. After she was buried, he still visited her tomb with his ministers. One day, he turned to Yuan and said, 'If you cry for the late Consort Yin with sadness, I will reward you handsomely.' Xing immediately wailed loudly, stomping his feet and crying bitterly. The Emperor was pleased and made him the Governor of Yuzhou." Getting promoted like this is truly unprecedented! Absurdity and shamelessness gathered in one place. To seek national peace and the people's prosperity is truly a dream!</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Four, Two Hearts in Harmony (16)</p>
<p>At this moment, the waiter brought up the third course. Qi Wan cut the steak with a knife, saying, "I think women are like this steak, delicious and ready to be slaughtered. You men are the ones holding the knives, able to choose as you please." Zhu Zhai smiled slightly, shaking his head. Qi Wan asked, "You don't agree with what I said?" Zhu Zhai said, "You see men too harshly. You don't know that men also have their own sufferings. The most important thing in a relationship between men and women is that their spirits can be comforted. If their spirits can be comforted, they can understand each other. If they can understand each other, love will naturally grow stronger day by day. Take my wife, for example. I don't need to mention whether she's beautiful or not, but in terms of common sense, she doesn't understand anything. Her mind is only filled with oil, salt, wine, and soy sauce. What she says is unbearably vulgar. How can I get along with her? I only feel pain with her. I can't get a single bit of comfort in my spirit." Qi Wan laughed, "Having such a virtuous housekeeper at home allows you to have no worries about the inner affairs. Are you still not satisfied?" Zhu Zhai said, "That's the view from fifty years ago. It doesn't fit with the times anymore." Qi Wan listened, glancing at Zhu Zhai, saying, "As the saying goes, 'A clever woman often sleeps with a clumsy man.' You're not clumsy, and she's not clever. It's exactly the opposite." She laughed as she said this, and Zhu Zhai couldn't help but laugh with her. Qi Wan added, "What I just said was all outdated. Please don't take offense!" Zhu Zhai said, "I hope you don't take offense. My wife was at the show last night. She didn't know what was important and said nonsense. I'm sure Little Wang's mother told you everything as a joke. There's really nothing I can do!" Qi Wan's eyes widened, showing a very strange expression, saying, "What do you mean? How can I blame you—does she know what kind of relationship I have with you?" After saying this, Qi Wan immediately felt that her words were too much. Her face suddenly turned red, and she lowered her head almost to the plate, smiling softly. Seeing her innocent and adorable appearance, and hearing her sweet words, Zhu Zhai's heart blossomed. He was only hindered by the waiter bringing in the coffee. Otherwise, he would have prostrated himself to thank the beauty for her discerning eyes. After having coffee, Qi Wan said, "I felt very happy talking today. It's still early. Let's take a walk somewhere." Zhu Zhai said, "Zhongnanhai Park is the closest. Shall we go to the park?" Qi Wan said, "That's fine. Zhongnanhai Park is relatively quiet. I haven't been there in a long time." Zhu Zhai hurried to pay the bill, but Qi Wan said, "What are you busy with? I've already paid." The waiter brought the bill, along with the remaining change. Qi Wan gave it all to him as a tip. The waiter thanked her repeatedly and hailed a car for them. The two went together to Zhongnanhai Park. At this time, the sun was setting, and the remaining light gradually disappeared. Twilight gathered in the park. A few scattered electric lights cast a weak glow. A light breeze caused ripples to rise in the Taiye Pond. Along the shore, sparse trees rustled, with yellow leaves falling on them. Zhu Zhai stroked Qi Wan's arm and said, "You're wearing so little. Are you cold?"</p>
<h3>Xie Bingying's Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>Asking for wonders not separated by a green gauze curtain, scolding catkins transformed into purple border clouds; this female hero is particularly lonely, news comes from beyond the sky.</p>
<p>Those who have read "A Woman Soldier's Ten Years" know that Bingying is a female hero. Heroes are bold and unrestrained, but I think the more bold and unrestrained a hero is, the more lonely they will feel. She said, "Like a heavily loaded camel, tiredly marching forward without end." Treacherous roads in the world, vicissitudes of human affairs, the pressures of life have made her lonely. She also said, "I want to go to the gentle Jiangnan again," but she still hasn't come. Yes, the weather in Jiangnan is somewhat milder, but in terms of the roads of the world and human affairs, it is a year-round severe winter!</p>
<h3>A Happy Family</h3>
<p>— Luo Ta</p>
<p>"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This is the first sentence of Tolstoy's book, Anna Karenina.</p>
<p>So, what does a happy family look like? Prompted by the huge advertisements in the daily newspapers for milk powder, cod liver oil, wool yarn, silk stockings, and aided by my own imagination, I construct this picture of a happy and fulfilling family:</p>
<p>The best season is deep winter, and the best time is evening, because only winter nights most easily reveal a family's happiness or unhappiness.</p>
<p>In a neatly and cleanly arranged room, seated in two sofa chairs in front of a burning fireplace are the father and mother. The father leans back in his chair, intently reading the evening paper. The mother sits upright, carefully winding a ball of wool yarn, preparing to knit a vest or gloves. Standing in front of her is a daughter of about twelve or thirteen years old, a large loop of yarn stretched between her outstretched hands. Judging by the curvature of the yarn hanging down between her hands, it can be seen that she, like girls everywhere, is clever enough to know to relax her hands, allowing the yarn to slip off loop by loop. If it were a boy of the same age, it wouldn't work; he would put all his strength into stretching the yarn taut, like a violin string, or like the countless wires between two electrical poles. Of course, behind the sister is a younger brother, no more than a year or two younger than her. He knows nothing but to rock back and forth on his wooden horse.</p>
<p>At the doorway stands a nanny, in her early thirties, carrying in milk, coffee, or cocoa (depending on whose advertisement it is). This nanny, though not possessing the beauty to topple cities or states, has regular features and a refined appearance. Her clothes, while not elaborate, are neat and clean from head to toe.</p>
<p>This is the uniform picture of a happy family. Although it may sometimes seem a bit dull and trite, it is, after all, happy and enviable, and I would very much like to join in.</p>
<p>However, I hope this picture stays just as it is, and doesn't move at all, because if it does, things will go wrong. Needless to say, an atomic bomb falling, stocks plummeting, or a bank collapsing could completely destroy this picture. But even if the father, sitting and reading the newspaper, were to suddenly have a whim, put down the paper, and glance at the nanny entering the room or make a funny face, and the mother happened to see it, she might throw down the ball of yarn and pounce, knocking the sister and brother over, the nanny spilling milk and coffee all over the place...</p>
<p>You see, as soon as that happens, the family's happiness is over! "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This is the end of a uniform picture of a happy family, and the beginning of a novel describing one of countless kinds of unhappy families.</p>
<p>And "Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered that the husband..." is also the beginning of Tolstoy's novel.</p>
<h3>Getting Rid of the Old and Welcoming the New</h3>
<p>— Tong Tuo</p>
<p>This day, we were happily saying that Lao Zhang, Lao Wang, Xiao Sun, and myself, four people in total, left the office and went straight to Zhengxing Restaurant for a big meal. Before leaving, I carefully tidied up my desk, putting things that should be kept on my person, such as a small knife, fountain pen, wallet, and lighter, into my pockets. I put on my coat and left leisurely. After 5:30 p.m., the streets were filled with crowds of people eager to return home. We weaved our way through the crowds, finally making our way through Henan Road and arriving at Zhengxing Restaurant. Zhengxing Restaurant has gradually learned to focus on cleanliness. In the past, there were greasy tables, black and dirty bamboo chopsticks, and a dilapidated building... This time, the place was completely transformed, arranged cleanly. The roof had been freshly painted, with a snow-white ceiling. Fluorescent lights had replaced electric lights, and the tables were covered with snow-white tablecloths. Bamboo chopsticks had long been discarded and replaced with imitation ivory chopsticks. It is said that old restaurants like this are frequented by a special group of customers, so they had no choice but to improve.</p>
<p>After we were full of food and drink, we left together, walking leisurely back to our residences. After sitting down, it was time to take out my pen to write something, but alas, the fountain pen that I had carefully placed was gone. I searched all my pockets, but couldn't find it. After thinking carefully, it must have been taken by a nimble pickpocket in the chaotic crowd earlier. Besides blaming myself for not being careful and the thief's skill, what else can I say? My old Parker, which had been with me for ten years, was separated from me like this. Besides being annoyed, there was also a sense of loss.</p>
<p>Having no choice, I bought a new one, still a "Parker." Fortunately, the new pen flowed more smoothly than the old one. I gladly considered myself a revolutionary, "Without destruction, how can there be construction?" Now my pen has been destroyed, but at least I have "constructed" a new pen. I thought that in this shy time, I actually had the spirit of getting rid of the old and welcoming the new, with a bit of the Shanghai "tough" style, and I couldn't help but feel pleased with myself for having a "revolutionary spirit." However, the problem lies in going to restaurants; the ancient saying "it is not auspicious to eat away from home" should be torn up now.</p>

<p>Postal Q&amp;A</p>
<p>Received letters from readers of this newspaper, Mr. Wang Yimin of this city, Mr. Yu Ximu, Mr. Xu Gonglin of Kaifeng, and Mr. Ma Weicheng of Wuxian, inquiring about: Here are brief answers to the points raised.</p>
<p>(Answer) (A) For mail to Japan, only airmail and regular letters and postcards are allowed. Surface mail is delivered by ships sailing to Japan. It takes about two or three days to reach Japan from Shanghai, but the ship schedule is uncertain. (B) For airmail to Japan, this bureau seals and sends mail every Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday, and hands it over the next morning to Northwest Airlines and American Global Airlines for delivery on flights to Japan via the United States, which can arrive on the same day. (C) The minimum amount for a domestic money order is one hundred yuan. The exchange rate is divided into special exchange bureaus and ordinary exchange bureaus. In the Beijing-Shanghai area, special exchange bureaus are in Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujin, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places. When remitting money, ask the remitting post office for a money order application form to fill out, ask about the remittance fee, and pay the remittance and remittance fee together. There are no other procedures.</p>
<p>(A) For letters exceeding the initial weight, add 2,000 yuan in postage for every 20 centimeters. (B) Printed matter and books that can fit into the mailbox slot can be posted from the mailbox. (C) Postcards can be purchased at various branches.</p>
<p>Airmail to the United Kingdom takes about six to ten days to arrive. There are outgoing dispatches every day at 8:00 p.m. (registered mail is sealed and sent one hour earlier), which are handed over to flights to Hong Kong or Calcutta the next morning for delivery.</p>
<p>Sending printed matter or letters to Taiwan by airmail does require an additional 1,000 yuan. Due to recent postage changes, airmail within 20 centimeters is now 3,000 yuan, and printed matter within 100 centimeters is 2,000 yuan.</p>
