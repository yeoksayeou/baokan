<h3>南海的前哨　西沙羣島</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>這站在我國南端的西沙羣島，法國又在覬覦了。西沙羣島原是我國國土，當然不能任人染指。去年七月二十三日，菲律賓外長奎林諾聲明，謂該羣島近在巴拉旺島以西，擬將其併入菲律賓，我國曾一度與菲律賓發生爭執。行政院旋即令知粵省府接收，並知照台省公署協助之，至今年一月六日，中宣部長彭學沛氏發表：中國政府已由日本佔領中收回西沙羣島，詎意翌日法外交部聲明：認爲該羣島乃屬於越南者。自一九三三年起，法曾强行佔領團沙羣島，直至一九三九年被日佔領爲止，其實團沙羣島即是西沙羣島的一部份，今復採用昔日强詞奪理的故技，覬覦這西沙羣島，寳爲不智。</p>
<p>西沙羣島位於海南島之東南約一百五十浬，在北緯十五度四十六分至十七七度五分，東經一百十度十四分至一百十二度四十五分，正介乎越南和菲律賓之間。共有大小島嶼二十餘個，都是珊瑚礁所結成的，最大的島面積的數十平方里，最小的面積還不及一平方里的十分之一。這一羣散在海中的珊瑚礁，隨着潮水的起落而時隱時現，在航海上，認爲這裏是一個危險的區域，所以在一九〇八年我國海關曾建議在此建立燈塔，一九三〇年，國際氣象會議席上亦有人提議，由中國政府在西沙羣島成立氣象台，以利海上航行。、</p>
<p>西沙羣島在軍事上有重視的價値，當一九三八年日本佔領西沙羣島的企圖，當時日本曾於三二六號東亞情報（一九三九年四月二十五日）上發表，謂「尤其我國海軍當局，對已在西貢，廣州灣保有艦隊根據地之法國，若再領有此飛行根據地及潛艇寄泊所，其結果將使南中國海上列强的海軍勢力，展開新形勢，由於國防上的見地，自然十分重視這一件事」。從此看來，可見所關非細。、</p>
<p>莫小視了這孤立海外隨着潮汐浮沉的一羣小島，在經濟上又是一個很大的利源，島上地質，是砂石和烏糞，由烏糞化石結成的燐酸礦，是島上著名的物產。日本燐礦公司曾在此設局採掘，迄民國十八年受世界經濟不景氣影響而終止，烏糞之分佈，以林島爲最富，所佔面積的一，二九一，六〇〇平方公尺，儲藏量約有三二，九〇〇立方公尺，合計二十五萬噸。環繞島嶼四周的淺海中，尙有很多的水產品，像海參，蚌蛤，墨魚，巢蟹，珊瑚，玳瑁，海藻，海菜，海棉等等。海南島人前往捕魚者甚多，每年兩次，春初去則夏初返，秋末去則冬末返，春季多捕海龜，秋冬均捉蚌蛤，惜運輸不便，且無法乾製，故產量不多。</p>
<p>海國聞見錄云：「七洋洲凡往來南洋者必經之，其東北有長沙，石塘等礁，舟行宜愼」。所謂七洋洲者，就是西沙羣島，可知在明末淸初時，我國已有關於西沙羣島的記載，但在漢代，李伏波將軍早已到過這裹，一八五八年中法天津條約之附圖，更指明西沙羣島應列入我國版圖。我國海洋學家發表Data　on　the　Time　Repuired　for　the　Buildiog　of　Coral　Reefs一文中，說明在西沙羣島珊瑚礁下五英尺處，曾發現大量的「永樂通寳」銅幣。若照馬氏的推算，一英尺珊瑚礁的構成需要一百年，那末我國佔有珊瑚島，已經是五百年前的事了，這是一個很好的證明。</p>
<p>不過我國過去對於海外經營是不甚注意的，就是這羣島嶼的發現，依據推測，最先並不是朝廷的官吏，而是海濱的漁夫。但我國政府始終並未表示放棄，在淸末時還派了吳敬榮前往查勘，計劃開發，次年，水師提督李凖亦率軍隊進駐該島，縣旗鳴砲，證實爲中國的領土，這事遠在法人佔領團沙羣島之前十五年。自一九三二年法國擬佔領團沙羣島起，我國始終聲明西沙羣島是我國領土的一部份，而法國一九三三年佔領團沙羣島，一九三八年佔領西沙羣島，均未予承認，並向法政府提出抗議，何以法國在今日勝利之後，仍施昔時帝國主義的故技呢？</p>
<p>西沙羣島旣爲我國領土，勝利以後，當然仍應由我國　　，毫無疑義。這次法國的覬覦，我們自應據理力爭’但還得更進一步，從事於移極性的建設，建房屋，修港口，闢航綫，能够在國防上作爲我國南洋的前哨站，在經濟上，也可獲得不少的利源，不要因其荒蕪而忽略了他的價値，以免再有同樣的事件發生。</p>

<p>我國政治，向重用人，昔人謂爲政在人，當時固專爲人治而言，然徒法不能以自行，即在今日法治時代，任何法令制度，其推行運用，亦完全在乎人，如何能使事得共人，如何能使人盡其才，如何能提高人之品格，發揮人之能力，皆屬人事行政範圍以內之事，凡百事業，倘非人事健全，配合得當，則一切人·時·財·地·物無不浪費，是故一般政務之推行，及各項建設事業之發展，必以人事管理之能否健全爲其先決條件。我國人事制度建立未久，其效能尙未充分表見，一般工作之鬆懈，行政效率之低微，考核監督之未周，賞買進退之有失公允，在今日猶爲習見，固無庸諱言，故人事管理之應積極加强發揮功用，以期確立官制，而收選賢與能之效，實爲不容稍緩之工作。數年以來，政府三令五申，注意於此，增設人事機構，負責推行，並舉辦人事管理人員訓練班，先後已歷八期，結業人員約有三千人，要其目的，即在培養廣大而健全之人事中堅幹部，分佈於各級人事機構，以納人事於正軌，以促政治之進步。所望諸同志自念職　之重，努力研究，期爲國用，在班時務須各本見知”檢討得失，使現行人事制度，獲有更新之改進；離班之後，尤當堅貞自矢？恪恭遵行，任何機關之內，若有一人任用不得其當，黜陟不得其平，則司人事管理者均應引爲自身莫大之恥辱，庶敷衍表面不切實際之舊習克以革除，而循名責實正確有效之風氣從以養成，建國前途有利賴焉。</p>

<h3>社論　聽聽人民的呼聲！</h3>
<p>自政府所提恢復和談新方案被中共斷然拒絕之後，使我們老百姓眼前的一錢希望，也歸於泡影；同時又因民盟約堅持成見，其他政黨的觀望不前，致使改組政府，也一時不能實現了。再瞧瞧魯南蘇北，共軍攻勢，愈打愈烈；東北的共軍，也在那裏秣馬厲兵，躍躍欲試。這一切的一切，無不足以證明：中共絕無放棄其武力割據的企圖；仍欲以戰亂促成國內經濟的崩潰，而遂其奪取政權的野心。所以國內的烽火，不僅沒有撲滅的可能，而且眼前的軍事衝突，更有擴大爲全面戰亂的危機。但是今日的中國，是百年積弱的國家，經過八年的艱苦抗戰，早已精疲力盡，亟待休養生息，恢復國家的元氣，如何再能忍受內爭的浩刧？所以目前國內的局勢，不僅使全國老百姓痛心疾首，而且也爲友邦人士所關切。</p>
<p>上海市參議會鑒於國事的凶險，首先通電今國，勸吿雙方立即停職，恢復和談，改組政府，俾能積極進行實旗憲政的準備工作；前天上海一百七十三個同業公會，也嚮應市參議會，通電全國人民呼籲和平，昨日上海社會工商各界鉅子王曉籟等又發表宣言，籲請雙方立即就地停戰。這都是國內人民要求和平的呼聲。此在國際上，馬帥已返抵華府就　國務卿之職。刻正在與杜魯門總統曁民主共和黨的領袖會商，俾能採取兩黨一致的對華政策。就是自顧不暇的英國，對於中國目前的局勢，也表示非常的關切，上　院工黨議員林賓勛爲所發表之言論。主張干涉中國內政，雖爲林賽議員對於中國政情的一種錯誤見解，但是也可以反映出英國人士的如何關切中國政治。所以我們從國內的民意看到國際的與論，不雖證明中外人士，莫不盼望中國立即停戰恢復和談改組政府，俾能早日走上和平統一民主建國的康莊大道。</p>
<p>政府自國民大會完成制憲工作圓滿閉幕之後，即與各方面接洽，企圖使恢復和談與改組政府，雙管齊下，以期早日使國內化干戈爲玉帛，不僅接受靑年與民社兩黨的意見，而且對於，中共所堅持的兩項要求，也表示相當的讓步，擬就了一個恢復和談的新方案，並欲派遣張治中將軍携往延安談判，殊不料竟遭中共的斷然拒絕，將洞開着的和談之門完全關閉。這一事實，在我們老百姓眼中，看得非常淸楚，深知這次政府對於恢復和談，不但有十二分的誠意，而且具有絕大的決心；至於這次和談所以不能恢復，不能不由中共負責。因爲在我們老百姓的心目之中，對於國事的看法，實在非常簡單，我們所希望的，旣是和平統一民主建國、我們所要求的，當然就是立即停戰恢復和談。不問中共所提出的兩項條件是如何的合理，但是終覺得在恢復和談之前，即提出要求、就是根本沒有誠意的表示。「不誠無物」無誠意的和談，即使勉强恢復，對於我們老百姓所希望的與所要求的，也是毫無補益的。中共素以民主百詡，謂任何措置咸以民意爲依歸；但是爲什麼中共不能聽聽我們老百姓從良心上發出的呼籲呢？</p>
<p>至於我們老百姓爲什麼要這樣迫切呼籲和平呢？王曉籟等發表的宣言，其中有一段說：「全國人民都快要活不下去了，由於戰爭，成千成萬的同胞，繼續轉乎滿　；由於戰爭，交通阻隔，通貨不斷膨漲，人民失業，工商破產。因此，我們不能不沉痛地發出良心的呼聲，要求停止戰爭，要求恢復和平。」這幾句沉痛的傷心語，在中共看來，或者還以爲正是中共所求之而不得的。調人馬帥在離華之際發表聲明，曾率直指出中共的陰謀，乃在以戰爭促成國內經濟的崩潰，從而達到其奪取政權的目的。但是我們要正吿中共，這個「苦肉計」是萬萬行不得的，試問中共把全國四萬五千萬的人民都害死了，中共即使奪得政權，還有什麽用處？所以我們要勸吿中共，切不可以黨派的利益超過於國家民族的利益！即使要達成某種目的，也不能不擇手段。老實說，中共之有今日，並非由其武力所造成，而是靠了」部份人民的支撐，如果中共不顧人民的死活，執迷不悟，則無異於自絕於國人。一個脫離了人民的政黨，決不能站住脚跟的，更不會有遠大的前程。所以我們要勸吿中共，應從大處着眼，平心靜氣，聽聽全國人民的呼聲，他們所希望的，他們所要求的究底是什麽？</p>
<p>至於民盟方面，我們看了民盟二中全會政治報吿的全文，對於民盟約見解：「國家必先有和平，而後國家才能够有團結與統一；國家必先有團結與統一，而後才能實施憲政，實現民主。」不僅在原則上表示完全贊同，而且認爲此時此際，尤爲適當，應力求其實現。所可惜的，民盟約實際行爲，正與其見解，背道而馳。目下全國人民最迫切的要求——立即就地停戰，迅速恢復和談，這不是要求國家應先有和平嗎？但是在這次恢復和談的接洽中，民盟匪特堅持成見，未能盡其第三方面調處的職責，反而替違背民意的中共曲意解釋。實在令人百思不解。又民盟對於改組政府，也採取冷淡與不合作的態度，致使目前國內的僵局無法打開。民盟旣以　於民主精神自稱，並據其解釋所謂民主精神，第一是容認，第二是互讓，第三是妥協，但民盟爲什麽堅持成見不肯稱變呢？即以擁護政協決議而論，我們要老實告訴民盟，真正履行政協決議的還是政府，中共不過以此爲幌子吧了。所以民盟旣站在第三者的立議　，就應保持不偏不倚的態度，對於國事尤應明是非，分黑白，辯曲直，切不可以稍存成見。我們承認民盟是一個獨立自主的政團，所以至今還希望民盟能依照其見解，謀國家與與人民的福利。目前國家與人民最大的福利，就是立即停戰恢復和科，民盟應與全國同胞共同向着這個目標努力，運用全國與論的力量，以能促成和平統一民主的實現。</p>
<p>要之，目下國內的局勢實在太凶險了，一切的禍根都是在戰亂，如果聽其蔓延，不但人民活不下去，而且國家也有覆滅於內爭之虞，因此我們不得不出來，向中共垂涕而道，希望中共受了仝國人民良心的感召而能大澈大悟，立即放秦其武力割據的企圖，而使國內化十戈爲玉帛。同時我們又不得不大聲疾呼，向民盟呼籲，請其拋棄成見，改變方式，以求國內和平統一民主的實現。</p>

<h3>北平美兵強姦女生案　公審最後一幕　從辯論到宣判記詳</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕美兵暴行案廿一日開辯論庭，檢察官宣佈皮爾遜罪成的要證後，辯護人根據他所找出的似是而非的證據，企岡說明此事件爲「合姦」，但終被檢查官駁倒，未再提出新證據。廿一日上午十時開庭，辯論一小時十五分休息，下午一時續開，僅經檢查官反駁三十五分鐘，便吿終止。旁廳者多是舊人，僅何思源換成了張伯謹，司法行政部的參事倪徵澳和東吳大學法學院教務長鄂森也在昨趕到，今出席旁聽。這是最重要的一天，大家都很注意，庭上的法官們今天也稍現出緊張。</p>
<p>補呈證物　辯論開始前，被害人沈崇特別出席，補呈上遣漏未提出的肇事之夜所穿的深紅色的棉袍，並說明了前下端的若千破洞，是當日所無的，前呈上的短褲和大衣，也是在十三日經過了洗刷的。約十分鐘後，辯論開始，檢察官先問被吿，願不願申訴？被吿辯護人代答「不願」。庭上宣佈在檢察官申述被吿犯罪的根據後，被吿方面僅能一次辯護，否則須提新證據，才可重辯。</p>
<p>並未同意　檢察官當說明，說根據三日來傳訊證人的結果，證實了沈崇並未同意和美兵作非法的性交，中國證人七人，都曾目賭皮爾遜在柬單大操塲數度壓在沈崇身上，中外兩醫師的檢騐報吿，也證實了因皮爾遜强姦所致的數處傷痕，沈崇在二美兵的强暴下，確曾作種種掙扎求救，故可判斷，（一）皮爾遜蓄意強姦，第三項的姦非罪不能成立、第四第五兩項可與第二一兩項合併，（二）皮爾遜在法庭上被認出爲當晚肇事主犯，（三）中美兩方醫生蹬明了皮爾遜的陰莖曾插入被害人的險戶，</p>
<p>確曾掙扎　（四）被害人確曾在暴力下掙扎，由五個中國兵前往觀看，被一美兵拒走，和執有武器的中國兵也被抗拒，可證明沈崇的抵抗不可能有效。</p>
<p>辯護　至此。被吿辯護人要求休息十分鐘後，宣佈了事先擬就的辯護辭，他說被告和沈崇發生性交時間，行人在百人以上，而沈未呼喚，中國兵士七人往看，沈也未呼喚，性行爲達三小時，但臀部未有傷痕，由此可證明沈未抵抗，沈謂頸部曾被扼制，但頸部無傷，腿上傷痕乃首决檢查後十一天才發現，缺乏確實理由，沈若干次回答中，有「不知道」「不淸楚」話語，亦屬可疑，且事後並未向美軍値勤憲兵當面控吿曾遭强姦，次日由中美聯絡室電話通知爲强姦案事，可能長沈崇姐丈楊某的僞造計劃等等，「所以可證明沈係同意，强姦罪不能成立」。至此庭上宣佈休息午餐。</p>
<p>反駁　下午一時，由檢察官反駁（一）所謂沈未呼喊，不實，作證的中國兵曾三次聽見，扼住頸部不一定造成傷痕，沈則隨時有生命危險，（二）證人中的劉志平昭明等，都曾控吿爲强姦案，値班的歐道中將也曾聽見了「姦」字，並自認可能自「强姦」二字誤聽而來，（三）三小時的停留，係皮爾遜所迫，（四）三小時中僅有二次性行爲，時間不長，皮爾遜也在酒後，傷痕不多，乃屬可能，（五）說沈未脫手套是同意，勿寗說是未同意爲宜，（六）男性強姦，陰莖不一定受傷·檢察官及駁畢，庭上問過辯護人無旁證提出後，宣佈退庭。</p>
<p>宣判　舊歷元旦的早晨，美軍法庭宣佈了皮爾遜的强姦罪的成立，旁聽的人並未因過節而减少，大家相見，互道恭賀新禧之後，從新爲勝訴握手，祝賀了一番。十時開庭後，楊格中尉照例宣續了昨日記錄，繼之檢查官起立宣佈「起訴書中的五項罪」，其中第一項强姦罪已經構成，第二第四兩項下成立，第三第五兩項又包括於前兩項並且奉到了駐津美海軍陸戰隊第一師師長霍華德的電報，予以撤鎖。隨着把原文交給被吿辯護人，他用顫動的手接過去，和助手看過，呈交庭上後，暫時宣佈休息。法官退入法庭隔壁的休息室，請檢察官入內講話，少時出庭，庭長就正式宣吿「被吿皮爾遜威廉姆所犯的第一項强姦罪成立」。</p>
<p>皮遜表爾的情　皮爾遜的面皮雖不露出過度不安的表情，但他聽見終於現出前所未見的恐慌接受了這個宣吿，隨着法官步下去。庭上宣佈，犯罪部份須等到覆核批准後，才能定刑，而且依法此案今後就不再公開審訊，可即依法處理。到十點卅五分，此世人注意的美兵暴行案，完成了公審的部分。</p>
<p>胡打沉適破默　美軍法庭宣佈了皮爾遜的强姦罪行成立後，胡適打破了數日來旁聽的沉默，他說「我早說過，我相信美軍的法庭一定是公正的，現在證實了我的話」。胡校長對這個宣吿，和其他人一樣表示了滿意，檢察官並且對旁聽的我地院檢察官紀元說，我們的軍事法庭是否太麻煩，太瑣屑，祀答很詳細，很妥當，對於這位檢察官的公正態度，表示了滿意。關於賠償問題，沈父說還沒頭緒，不知何時才另案提出。這位始終嚴肅注意公審進行的沈劭，帶有微笑，提了曾作證據的大衣棉袍白褲，冒着雪和人們同出了美軍的法庭。</p>
<h3>西子湖上春消息</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>杭州訊</p>
<p>在全國普遍不景氣的情景下，三十五年的舊曆年關總算過去了。杭州——這人間的天堂，在舊曆年關時確也過了不少黯淡的日子。但是，去的已經去遠了，再也不必追溯，應該循着目前的路，去憧憬未來的遠景。</p>
<p>這幾天來，天堂已沒有窮酸相，許多店舖貼着紅紙元寳或是紅紙對聯之類大家休息三天，大家穿着新衣服，尤其是虔誠的善男信女舞，雖然在舊曆除夕和大年初一下着偌大的雨，但是阻不住他們的誠心，他們還爬上玉皇山燒香，有的在山上宿夜，有的撐着傘或是披着雨衣翻過許多山崗，到三天竺還願，也有在那裏宿</p>
<p>在鬧市中的城隍山，也是香烟鼎盛，許多人持着香燭要去懇求城隍菩蕯赦免他以往一年的罪惡，人類真是有「善根」的，他們許心爲「善」。但是財神廟裏也擠得水洩不通，他們企求着未來的一年能够財運亨通，能够多幾根金條，買一點房子。在離湖濱膺白路不遠的金華將軍廟，也是肩摩踵接，據說這位菩蕯靈得很，求什麽得什麽的，在求什麽不得什麽時，當然又是人們所謂「刧數」了。</p>
<p>連湖心亭裏的觀自在菩薩面前，也供着米粉做的元寳，素火腿，素蹄膀之類，原來凈素的「觀音菩蕯」也想葷食和發財了。</p>
<p>千元法幣黯然失色</p>
<p>拜年之風也特盛行，汽車行，三輪車，黃包車生意都特別好，南貨店裏的紅紙紮包年禮堆在櫃檯上讓顧客們選擇。大家希望送一點禮能够還萊一點禮，所以兩貨店裏也生意興隆。一些小販們在高抬價格「殺年豬」過後，又是來一個「元寳」賞，意思是多給一些錢給他們，就會瞬間在的元寶，人總是愛奉承的，這點錢自然也不吝惜，而况已越過了難過的年關。由上海帶來的二五〇元和五〇〇元的關金券活躍市上，許多一千元的法幣都黯然無色。有幾位闊老一張張數，「豁，豁，豁」的聲音叫人豔茨不止。</p>
<p>想盡方法尋找快樂</p>
<p>舞廳開禁十六天，又可盡情的陶醉，雖然淸茶賣到五千元一杯，但鈔票如廢紙，一片片飛又有什麽關係。各報還載有×浴室秘密跳舞，這都是想盡方法在尋快樂，娛樂塲所自然利市三倍了。</p>
<p>各機關團體自動放了假，蔬菜買不到，吃食店都對了爐，私人用的車伕都請假過年，許許多多胖胖的臉上都泛上紅潮，這是他們在×府用過了酒席。馬路上，人推着人，眞是紅男綠女，車接着車，眞是車水馬龍，長大的行列，每個人都堆着笑，也不可不笑，不得不笑，因爲「不笑了會終年愁苦的」。滿街劈拍的甩砲聲，這是兒童們的過年。這個舊曆年的魔力竟如此之大。爲什麼？是爲了中國是農村社會呀，這尤尤人的新年休息，可說都靠着農村社會的福呢？</p>
<p>風雨雪　絲絲春意</p>
<p>春節中，天堂下了雨，括了風，落了雪，據湖濱划子吿訴我們：「雖然立春還有幾天，但那雨連綿不斷，像春雨；那風，忽小忽大，沉沉地，是「直兒風」，像春風；那雪，飛着，飛着，綿軟而乏力，懶洋洋地，像春雪」。是的，天堂已有絲絲春意了。我爲了追尋春的消息，曾雇着划子，泛舟湖中，徒步白堤，蘇堤，細細的留意她的踪跡。</p>
<p>遠遠的一片山，山上的草已經開始嫩綠了。寳石山與初陽台的山巒已把枯黃的顏色塗上了淡緣的油彩。堤上落盡了尖畏葉子的柳樹，開始在抽出比米還小的新芽，遠望也呈着一抹青春地氣象。</p>
<p>小　洲，湖心亭，平湖秋月都已慢慢地掙開了眼，她們望着濛濛湖上的生意，微微地笑了笑，披起了輕紗，半樑地也蘇醒了過來。</p>
<p>野鴨羣，牠們已知道湖水開始溫暖了，這本來任牠們嬉戲的湖面將變成　人們的樂園，牠們這幾日聚會商談，如何到田間去刦食。但人們已在計議如何捕捉牠，以免傷害食糧，牠們的末日也快到了。</p>
<p>急忙忙　企待遊客</p>
<p>凈慈寺，虎跑寺，六和塔，靈隱寺，玉皇山寺都趕急把菩蕯開了光。打掃了佛殿，客房，雇用素齊的名廚以備春問來燒香的遊客享受。賣唸珠，手杖，布鞋，木魚的，都在大量向產處批購，以備遊客們帶回去作紀念、山核桃，香榧，九製橄欖、香糕都由商店大量批進，以備遊客們帶回去一點土產。香燭舖大量製造香燭，相信今年春天一定比去年鬧，因爲他們已虔誠的拜過菩蕯了。連各處名勝區的照相館，也在抖擻精神，努力凖備。有的裝璜一新，有的夢進很多材料。這忙忙碌碌的一羣都企望着今年春季能够做一筆好賣買，借着名勝的光，菩蕯　的光，發一發財。</p>
<p>得雪海醖釀得雪浪</p>
<p>臘梅已將殘落了，在中山公園內的幾校臘梅樹，已花黃滿地，顯得枝幹凋零。孤山的春梅，吐着靑豆一樣的苞，綘紅的顏色，令人喜愛。岳王墳前的幾枝，也放着嫩綠色的花苞，超山的香雪海，正在醞釀香雪浪的時候。她們都在吿訴人們，春的聲音已經在西子的跟前了。她想突然地來到，但西子已在冬眠裏醒過來了。</p>
<p>今應該比去年好吧？在天堂裏的人們，在春消息已傳來的時候，你在今年怎碟做？才能比去年好呢？</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕倫敦巴勒斯坦圓桌會議，定於廿七日復會。據悉，該會如若再告失敗，英外相貝文則準備聯合國大會至本年秋間舉行時，提出巴勒斯坦問題。據阿拉伯代表團代表宣稱，渠等將堅持其在圓桌會議上半期會議時所採取之立塲，對於任何計劃，除在巴勒斯坦設立阿拉伯獨立國外，均將予拒絕。阿拉伯代表團所願作之唯一讓步，乃爲允許猶太人佔多數之城市，取得自治，此在猶太復國遝動方面，則主張劃分巴勒斯坦，對於任何計劃，凡不規定設立猶太獨立國者，均拒絕予以接受。聞英內閣，對於問題之意見亦不一致，殖民大臣瓊斯主張劃分巴勒斯組，而外相貝文則深懼此舉，或將產生不良後果，故表示異議。</p>
<h3>英埃談判逆轉　將提請安理會解決　癥結仍在蘇丹問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社開羅廿五日電〕埃及某閣員今日在此披露，埃及內閣已決定將目前牽涉對英談判之事件，提請聯合國機構安全理事會決定。埃總理諾克拉奇星期一午後將在議院宣佈此事。聞埃及內閣係會議三小時後，通過上項決議，一致拒絕英方之最近建議，此項建議，有關英埃談判修改一九三六年同盟條約，撤除埃境英方軍事基地及解決英埃蘇丹將夾地位之問題，但目前尙未披露。某閣員又稱：埃及始終開放對英重新談判之門戶，但現在終已決定將此問題提交聯合國機構，而停止對英直接折衝。消息靈通人士稱：關於撤除埃境英方陸海軍及其設施問題，可於廿三年內獲得圓滿妥洽。惟整個問題，悉繫於蘇丹將來地位如何。埃及要求對此地區，單獨獲得完全主權，英方主張舉行公民投票，以決定蘇丹土人之願望，蘇丹領袖則欲取得獨立。</p>
<p>英方聲明</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅廿六日電〕今夜此間英大使館發表聲明日：據倫敦政界聲稱，英國與埃及關於蘇丹問題之談判，雖已臻極微妙之階段，但倫敦並未放棄仍可商得同意之希望。最近兩日中，英外相貝文曾兩次訪問駐倫敦埃及大使，駐開羅英大使亦曾與埃及總理諾克拉奇作長時間之會商，埃總理昨曾覲見埃王法羅克，就實際言，雙方之接觸現仍充分加以維持，力國覓求可令兩政府滿意之蘇丹方案，英國官方認爲談判門戶今仍開啓，開羅負責方面稱此談判業已決裂，因而引起之悲觀氣象，英官方並不謂然。聲明中又稱：除蘇丹問題外，兩政府對修正英埃條約之議，已完全同意。按兩政府對蘇丹問題之意見抵牾，實由對去秋貝文與當時埃總理西特奇在倫敦所草定之蘇丹協定解釋各異而起。</p>
<h3>英人指責波蘭行動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：獨立工黨秘書曁印度國大黨英國委員會秘書勃洛克威發表談話稱：聯合國對於波蘭政府驅逐西萊西亞德僑一事，倘視若無賭，則不復能譴責納粹份子。蓋即如波茨坦協定亦曾明白規定，此類行動應符合人道標準。按勃氏在第一次世界大戰時曾以「煽動反戰」罪被傳至法庭凡九决。當第二决世界大戰，渠曾印發有關獨立勞工運動之小册子。</p>

<h3>英蘇兩國關係　將進入新階段　貝文擬與蘇商討修改盟約　史達林所稱保留引起猜測</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿五日專電〕此間外交觀察家今預測自史達林接受貝文之重申英蘇盟約仍屬有效後，英蘇之關係可能進入一新階段。僉信貝文將藉三月間赴莫斯科出席四處長會議之便，與史達林商討有關修改條約之各種可能</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕英蘇兩國交換照會重申一九四二年英蘇同盟條約之效力後，英蘇合作又展開一廣大的新局面。莫斯科與倫敦兩地觀察家宣稱，此項條的之修正與擴大，或將奠定兩強合作之嶄新的基礎。史達林致貝文照會中，主張淘汰盟約中之軟弱條文，究何所指，英國方面正待繼續闡明。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕自英法兩國發表聯合公報，宣佈兩國即將締結盟約之後，英蘇兩國又曾迭次交換照會，英蘇關係，因此已見改善。此間外交界人士咸認爲英蘇關係之改善，定以加强艾德禮首相與貝文外相對內對外之地位。按在一年以前，英蘇關係緊張，美國方面亦認爲英蘇兩國間確有敵對之情緖存在。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕屋期日出版之倫敦各報對於史達林與英外相貝文交換之函件，雖認爲已一部分澄淸外交之空氣，但對於英蘇條約所謂「史太林之保留」，究屬何種性質，紛加猜度。觀察報外交訪員謂史達林之保留，可由以英蘇條約就蘇聯隨後與法國南斯拉夫捷克波蘭所訂之盟的相比較而知其用意所在。英蘇盟約僅於德國或其前衛星國之一攻擊蘇聯或英國時始發生效力，波蘇盟約則規定兩締的國應取一切可能之方法，消除德國或直接或用其他方式與德國聯合之任何國重作侵略之威脅，易言之，英蘇聯盟乃純粹保衛性質，波蘇聯盟則可釋爲並包括前次之戰爭。星期日時報外交訪員相信史達林之意認爲某種心理上之保留，或可在各國際塲合如地中海，韃靼海峽，最近如斯比資貝根引起政策之抵觸。</p>

<h3>對奧和約第一條草就　承認奧獨立自主　防德奧合併決定載入附錄　法對德問題將續提備忘錄</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七五日電〕四外長代表會議今日完成其對起草德奧和的第二星期之準備工作，條文僅草成一句，原文如何並未發表，但會中同意應承認奧地利之自由與獨立，此一原則在紐約四外長會議中早已商定。美代表克拉克以諷刺口吻曰，此一句條文爲「偉大之成就」。克氏將於廿七日會議中任主席，並擬加速議事。克拉克將添設專家委會多組分工合作，俾於三月十日莫斯科外長會議前，完成外長代表會議之工作。各代表原定今日開會聽取加拿大對德國和約之意見，但加政府表示不預備陳述意見，故會議臨時取消。</p>
<p>〔國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕四國外决本日討論關於防止德奧合併之措施，英代表發言稱，此種保證應列入特別附錄，直至奧國能在聯合國範圍內保證其自身之安全時而後已。美代表主張擬定一項方案，綜合盟國與聯合國對於奧國獨立所提供之保證，法代表贊成英代表之意見，此在蘇聯代表亦不反對將禁止德奧合併之措施列人附錄之中。</p>

<h3>美國務院官員　責蘇歪曲事實</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國務院官員今夜在此間無綫電播音中，指責蘇方指使在歐洲各國從事大規模宣傳活動，故意　瞞或歪曲報道美官員所發言論，並將美國生活，渲染成奇怪而紊亂之情形。國務院國際新聞處史東與賴埃斯曁羅京美國新聞處希亞三氏均稱：蘇方述及美國人恒指爲「籲武，侵略，豪富，驕奢與帝國主義之人民」。希亞稱：例爲羅馬尼亞境丙蘇方統制之宣傳機關，曾報道美國前國務卿貝爾納斯與參院外交委員會主席范登堡之言論，「幾乎已改變兩氏之原意。」范登堡於四大國巴黎和會之後曾有「蘇聯不欲戰爭」，「美國不欲戰急一等言，然羅國報紙僅戰「蘇聯不欲戰爭」字樣，「此非歪曲報道，簡直慘遭肢解。」貝爾納斯演詞述及撤回歐洲駐軍及多瑙河自由貿易原則各節，羅國報紙隻字不提云。頓埃斯稱：貝爾納斯在斯都加德演說，叙述波蘭未來邊界商題，共產黨控制之波蘭報紙與電台，根本未提隻字。</p>
<h3>越人低頭思故鄉　旅法越南工人急待遣送返國</h3>
<p>〔路透社馬賽廿五日電〕越南工人一萬二千名現急待當局遣送彼等返其故鄕，此可爲今日東方人對待西方最佳之例證，籍以可知東方並未爲西方所感動。此輩工人與歐洲文明接觸已約七年，而仍無留戀之意。彼等現分居法政府在各處所設之營房，其中最大之一所設於馬賽正東之瑪柴格鎭。</p>
<p>路透社訪員曾至該營巡禮，見營中寓有越人二千名，全營共分七隊，每隊有一代表或發言人，各代表皆透澈發表彼等之意見，據謂一九三九年與一九四。年法國共招募越南工人一萬四千名至法從事農田與森林等工作，雖經的定戰爭終止後立即遣送回越，但至今僅遣送二千人左右，法國當局所稱延遲遣送，實由輪舶缺乏之故，然最近數月中法國曾運兵數萬名前往遠東，其輪舶何來，可見其言不攻自破。</p>
<p>又曰：吾人前處法人管轄下，受奴隸之待遇，衣不蔽體，食不果腹，每日僅領工資佛郞二枚，今日所受之待遇，相當滿童，吾人在營中有充分之自由，可發表言論，並作政治活動，但不得作公開之示威。吾人所欲者，爲越南之完全獨立，不得稍打折扣，吾人曾目覩歐洲之民族與政治，但未見有甚可欽佩處，在技術上吾人仍須多所學習，惟吾人感覺力能創立自己生活之道，並自己之政治哲學。當戰爭期間，吾人曾聞許多的言，吾人相信大西洋憲章及盟國所吿吾人能進入新時代之其他言論。法政府戰時殊樂得吾人之勞工與士兵爲助，今則法英在戰爭困難下對殖民地民族所作之的言，似有反汗之意。</p>
<p>諸代表一再言及希望美國出而干涉，終止越南之戰爭，彼等視英國爲擁有殖民地之强國，故對越人之民族願望，不表同情。彼等對蘇聯與共產主義，顯頗關切，許多越人對於蘇聯應付其種族問題之狀態，殊爲感動。此輩越人留法愈久，則其意志必愈堅決，彼等他日返其故國，不致爲善意之使者。</p>

<h3>和平運動發起宣言</h3>
<p>和平運動發起宣言全文，及迄目前爲止，已簽名贊成之發起人名單如次：　八年抗戰勝利之後，我們本可和平統一，建設民主富强之國家，不幸國內兵禍繼續延長而且擴大。舉世共慶昇平，而我國的戰爭狀態還未停止。一個貧弱的國家流血十年，並且還在流血。我們不亡於日本的侵略，却將亡於自己的內爭。這是全國人民不勝痛心，也萬難長久忍受的。</p>
<p>全國人民都快要活不下去了。國家的地位也一天比一天低落了。由於戰爭，成千成萬的同胞繼續轉乎溝壑，散之四方。由於戰爭，交通阻隔，通貨不斷膨脹。於是農工失業，工商破產，其他各種職業者無不朝不保夕。於今社會解體，人心不安，不僅政治改革經濟建設無從談起，一切不正常不道德的事件勢將日益蔓延。戰爭如不停止，同歸於盡的慘禍就在眼前。如果我們再想到不久國際上就要討論對日和約，那時候，曾經爲和平而戰的中國，竟不能自保國內的和平，不僅合理的要求有被人拒絕之可能，也許還會受到意外的挫折。那就連抗戰的成果，國家的前程，也都要斷送乾淨。</p>
<p>全國人民都在譏餓綫和死亡綫上了。一切不幸的根源，都在戰爭。因此，我們不能不沉痛地發出良心的呼聲：要求停止無意義的戰爭，要求恢復和平和秩序。然後才能以統一團結的力量，完成民主建國的大業。我們對任何政治派別，均無成見，我們只要求不以武力解決爭執，而以談判實現和平。</p>
<p>這種和平呼籲，過去不止一次。而都不免遭到各種困難。然而我們實在活不下去了，我們已顧不得許多了。我們不願追溯旣往，也希望大家不算舊賬。谷以檢討別人者檢討自己，以寬恕自己者寬恕別人。我是只是垂涕而道，希望立刻化干戈爲玉帛，立刻停止戰爭，立刻恢復和談。我們都是有職業的人，決不願捲入目前政治糾紛的漩渦；我們只薪求天下太平，安居樂業。我們不能坐視工商百業民族命脈長此毀於內爭，不得不起來向各方急切呼　，還我和平；且將在此一呼　發出之後，　各方對於和平的　意，保留道義的批評之權。我們將不斷的呼　。一且和平實現，我們的這一運動即宣吿終止。</p>
<p>不停戰即是滅亡，唯和平才能建國。我們希望全國同胞，尤其是各職業界人士，一致起來，以全國與論的力量，全民良心的感召以及大公無私的精神和態度，促成和平，統一，民主的實現。國家復興，在此一舉。民族前途，實利賴之。謹此宣言。王曉籟·王世圻·王志稼·王善祥·王厚生·王慶餘·王敬修·王國賢·王瓊·方慶咸·田和卿·田仁甫·史鳳美·李登輝·李元吉·李晋候·李華卿·朱子餘·朱伯康·朱向榮·汪運生·沈慶坻·宋子强·何志新·　志·吳蘊初·吳恒儉·吳震球·吳邦藩·吳幹·周家聲·周孝伯·周曹裔·周靜寀·周佩寳·金潤庠·邵振璋·胡鄂公·胡伯翔·胡秋原·施叔侯·兪元芳·查璉·徐靜仁·秦潤卿·秦冰鈞·夏儀同·時壽彤·馬斯才·陳霆銳·陳滋堂·陳惠堂·陳志皋·陳振九·陶樂勤·曹志功·陸費鐸·許印源·郭紹儀·張光禹·莊智煥·梅伯平·葉景葵·端木愷·楊一之·壽景偉·壽墨卿·劉志方·劉釗·蔣漢文·樓丹父·諸伯鎔·鄭政·錢納水·錢夢渭·韓佐之·韓侍桁·蘇楚眞·胡曲園·嚴獨鶴·王劍鍔·周勤伯·葛傑臣·民國三十六年（一九四七）一月二十六日。</p>

<h3>確保海道旅客安全　交通部訂定　懸賞救護辦法　凡遇輪船失事時附近船伕漁戶應盡力撈救</h3>
<p>國內沿海及川江各地，每遇輪船失事時，兩岸停靠之木船駁子及漁戶，對落水旅客及船員，往往坐視不救，冀圖撈掠貨物。此次吳淞口芷江與華通輪猛撞時，亦發現有大批駁子搶奪行李貨物情事。交通部爲謀確保海道旅客安全起見，頃特訂定輪船業懸賞救護辦法，通令全國航政機關一切實執行：（一）輪船失事，除本輪及其她輪船船長救助及撈救，應照海商法規規定辦理外，附近木船船伕及漁戶人等，應盡力撈救，凡自水中救起生還旅客或船員一人，經證明屬實者，酬給國幣五萬元，撈出屍身一具，證明屬實者，酬給國幣三萬元，上項酬金，由失事輪船公司或行號支給之。（二）被救人或其家屬親友於前項獎金外，自願酬勞救護者，聽其自便，但施救人不得勒索。（三）輪船失事時，附近輪船船伕及漁戶人等不救助者，得由軍警或輪船護航隊强迫其施救，或逕取用其船隻，從事施救，事後均不給酬。（四）輪船失事時，遇有乘機掠取貨物行李，一經查獲，即送法院嚴辦。本市航政局業已奉令，切實辦理云。</p>

<h3>上星期一　紐約銀價慘跌</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿五日電〕上星期一（一月二十日）銀價每盎斯慘跌五·二五分，爲一九二〇年十二月八日以來最劇烈之挫跌，該日銀價亦暴跌五·二五分，係因某大公司實行跌價以吸引買戶所致。按歷史上銀價暴跌之最高紀錄爲一九二〇年六月七日之一〇·二五分自去年十二月上句銀價趨跌以來，柯達公司每年至少可節省三百萬元。同時白銀商要求取消値百抽五十之白銀交易利潤稅之聲浪後甚囂塵上。東方之消費者對於美國財部以每盎斯九〇·五分之價格收買國內白銀之法律，亦嘖有煩言。銀器製造商預料一九四七年之白銀產量將較一九四一年之記錄增加二倍以上，但即此數量亦不能應付戰時之定貨。</p>

<h3>北平金價猛漲　金店賠累不堪</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕此間金融界人士談：北平金價猛漲之結果，不少金店賠累不堪，舊歷元旦前逃匿之金店經理達十一人，舊歷正月初六開市，今日之暗盤爲五十六萬，一般心理認爲開市後，將升至六十六萬。據內行人談：此次猛漲而遠過滬價之原因有三，一爲巨額關金券，二爲飛機失事，滬機停駛，三爲某方在平一次購去四百條，因金價暴漲及戰火擴大，和談低沉，一般物價亦大受影響。平均較兩個星期前，各物上漲一倍或十分之六七不等，漲價最多者爲布匹云。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽新春第一戰　全黑遭巨人痛擊　綠林延長時間中克服V隊　女子組綠隊輕取強華</h3>
<p>二屆籃球聯賽，昨日下午五時半起，男女三塲，賡續在市體育館球塲角逐，因天時寒冷，觀衆未見擁擠。比賽結果，綠隊以四十五比十六勝强華，甲二部綠林與V隊戰成和局，延長時間，綠林險勝V隊，甲一部全黑烏合之衆，以十四比四十六遭互人痛擊。各賽戰情分誌於後：</p>
<p>綠隊女子大勝強華</p>
<p>首場女子組綠隊對強華登場，開賽後，綠隊黄明媛兩擲連中，以四比零領前，未幾綠隊王維珍犯規，强華曹曼麗罰入，黄明媛籃下托入，强華王竣遠射破籃，迨綠隊李蘊芝探中，以八比三佔先。强華奮發有爲，曹曼堤王竣二罰俱中，以五比八接近，奈綠隊棋高一着，第一節終了，綠隊以十四比五領前。第二節中，綠隊黄明媛首中，强華曹曼麗罰入，綠隊劉寳珍錦上添花，黄明媛連連鵠中，分數激增，强華呼暫停，仍無效果，上半時完畢，綠隊以三十比七佔絕大優勢。　易籃之後，交鋒不久，綠隊伍美矣犯規畢業，徐仁寳應補人塲，强華稍見振作，然綠隊後防嚴密，前鋒黄明媛等又銳不可當，第三節强華以十一比卅六落後。最後一節，强華曹曼麗籃下反身托進後，綠隊加緊進攻，成四十比十三。强華曹曼麗遠擲破籃，一時尙見活躍，奈綠隊監視，步步加緊，强華又難得展，迨鐘聲響處，綠隊以四十五比十六勝强華。</p>

<p>綠林據戰　延長得勝</p>
<p>次幕甲二V綠林對部隊登場，接觸後，V除王守理侵人犯規，綠林王介平罰中，以一比零開紀錄，未幾，綠林李景根兩罰連中，三比零佔先。V隊呼停，綠林以樂嘉洲趕到，易出李景根，綠林端賴罰球得分，未幾祝明星百步穿楊，籃下竄進，以五比七接近，莊逸凱射入，九比九迫成平手。綠林舒家義遠擲破籃，又以十一比九再度佔先，V隊呼停，以徐少明進塲，替出王念慈。綠林林少華亦加入戰國，樂嘉洲下野，上半時完畢，綠林以十五比九領前。</p>
<p>易籃再戰，V隊以吳詩鑑易出王守理，夏厲掉下莊逸榮，綠林原陣未動。接觸後，徐少明罰進，錄林葉雲山亦以一擲一罰回敬，成十八比十。V隊力圖挽回，果見祝明星鵠中，夏厲罰入，稍見起色，未幾祝明星梅開二度，舒家義罰球得點，十七比十九，比數漸接近。綠林見勢不佳，合力進製，又見抬頭。V隊再以王念慈易出夏厲，廿五比廿時，絲林華雲山五决犯規畢業，樂嘉洲入補。莊逸凱罰進，綠林舒家義亦以犯規被黜，易以李景根。祝明星罰入，比數成廿二比廿五，相差僅三分。法定時間吿終，各廿七和局。延長五分鐘，綠林樂嘉洲竄進，李景根罰入，樂嘉洲再度劉郞，以卅二比廿七前領，迨祝明星罰中，莊逸凱五决犯規出塲，王守理進補，樂嘉洲罰入，延長時間完畢，綠林以卅三比廿八吿捷。</p>

<p>壓軸戲，甲一部全黑相逢巨人，全黑以陶紹生，陸大振，徐菊生，何孝光，張少卿五將登塲。接觸後全黑徐菊生首開紀錄，巨人陶勃林基還以顏色，於是陶勃林　與徐菊生，投李報桃，此數五比八，巨人佔先。十四比八後巨人以鮑萊入塲，易出谷佛，N沙司金替出强杜萊，分數扶搖直上，全黑疲態畢露，上半時吿終，巨人以廿三比十領前。</p>
<p>易籃再戰，全黑以嚴又陵易出周智，巨人以谷佛更替浮尼克，分數成三十比十，巨人喧赫一時。全黑急以陸大振調出嚴又陵，巨人亦多更動，全黑以車輪應戰，依然無效，迨卅八比十後，全黑稍有所獲，巨人聲勢仍盛，結果巨人以四十六比十四，輕取全黑。巨人　犯分　全黑　犯分鮑萊　一　二　徐菊生　三五陶勃林基　一　十六　嚴又陵　〇〇浮尼克　〇十　陸大振　周智　一四簡沙司金〇　四　張少鄉　〇〇谷佛　一　七　瞿僑南　一二N沙司金　〇　三　陶紹生　〇〇强杜萊一　二　何孝先一一耶龍　一　二　三二共計五四六　共計九十四</p>
<h3>在成長中的中國新專　是一個理想的新聞學府</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>鐵血宰相俾斯麥說「要挽救歐洲和平，必須絞死一打新聞記者」，威廉第二也說：「我雖有精兵百萬，可惜沒有一張泰晤士報」，從這兩句話我們就可以曉得新聞的力量與重要，然而，綜觀新聞學的歷史，也不過近三十年的事，世界者名的密蘇里大學新聞學院，創於一九〇八年，哥倫比亞大學新聞學院一九一三年舉行奠基典禮，所以，新聞學至今還是一門最幼稚的科學。談到我國的新聞敎育，說來可憐，除燕京復旦外，幾乎沒有一校設立新聞系。最近，中央政大也正式添設了新聞系，然而憑着這兩三個大學新聞系畢業的學生，要應付未來新聞事業的發展與推動，實在是不够的。同時，八年來血的經騐吿訴我們，每一次大小戰役的各種新聞報導，無不有賴於新聞記者，而這些人才戰時是不能草草培植的。今天，我們勝利了，而且在走上建國途徑，由於過去的敎訓，由於現實的需要，中國必須有一個龐大的新聞學府，來造就新聞幹部，但事實並不如理想，物質條件的困難，人才的缺乏，敎育的落後，……等等，這些客觀環境的限制！當我們遙遙期待失望之餘，陰暗之角落裏突然現出微微的曙光，一座新出的新聞學府，隨着這新時代的需要誕生了，那就是今日正在成長中的中國新聞專科學校。</p>
<p>校長陳高傭先生，曾任復且大學敎投，也是中國十大名敎授之一，他以北方人豪爽的氣魄，團結了一些新聞界的朋友，更得到了敎育文化界人士的贊助，艱苦撑支了一副重祖子，決心在中國創辦一個理想的新聞學府。</p>
<p>「新專」敎授，全是海上名記者，市府新聞處處長朱虛白，祖任採訪學；前綫日報總主筆錢納水，担任編輯學；第三方面軍新聞處副處長魯莽，担任時事分析；武漢日報駐滬辦事處主任程仲文，担任社論學；曁南大學敎育系主任張耀翔，担任社會心理學；曁南大學敎授孫貴定，担任英文翻譯；申報副總輯王啓熙，卜少夫，主筆儲玉坤，分担採訪學，期刊編輯，及新聞學槪論。其他敎授，亦均爲國內新聞界知名之士。</p>
<p>該校隨抗戰勝利而創設，爲時已一年，研究科結束兩屆，畢業生近四百人，雖然都不是從事新聞，但大部已在報館服務，其散佈於京·滬·蘇·浙·贛·皖·閩五省各大小報館，任外勤記者與編輯不下百餘人，其他如在各通訊社工作者亦很多，而這些剛出校門的新聞戰士，雖是毛頭小伙子，他們幹的精神，工作的態度與熱誠，確博得了新聞界前輩的贊許，如第一屆畢業學生蔡益標，現任中央社記者，以一條新聞的採得，爲馮有眞先生贊賞，由實習記者立刻升爲正式記者，這些也許由於年靑，然學校基本敎育的影響亦不可抹煞。</p>
<p>目前該校學生共四班，本科分一上（分甲乙丙三組）一下二上，三班，硏究科一班（分甲乙兩組），全校學生約四百餘人，男生佔五分之四，女生佔五分之一。上課時間本科在白天，硏究科在晚間，學生水準，本科學生太半高中畢業，亦有少數大學肄業，或在外兼職與兼讀兩校。硏究科學生，皆係大學二年肄業，大學已畢業者，亦復不少，正在各界服務者頗多，允以現任各報記者與編輯爲衆，其次有醫生，律師，中學敎師，演員，復員靑年軍等。局外人若聞悉彼等份子複雜，一定感到良莠不齊，影響校風，其實，一個新聞從業人負應無所不知，包羅萬象，這許多不同份子聚在一起，正是爲未來工作接觸各階層社會的好機會，這一點，也是與別的學校不同之處。</p>
<p>學生的年齡最小祗十六歲，最大亦不過三十歲，從年齡上看，這些學生都還年靑，因此，除聽課外，他們在課餘很活躍，如壁報，演戲，組織球隊等。同時，校方爲鼓勵學生提高研究學術興趣起見，也曾舉行了英文中文演講競賽，文藝競賽，各班學生皆爭先恐後，踴躍參加，彼此各不相讓以決一雌雄。他們這種活潑天眞的神情，正象徵着中國新聞事業前途發展的樂觀。</p>
<p>除正規課程外，他們還有課外作業，如文藝習作，專訪特寫，中英文互譯，時事評論等，這些都是補助正課之不足。另外，還有小型的圖書館，規模雖不大，足够學生們常作精神食糧及參考資料，每當下課鈴一搖，或上課鈴未響，他們即蜂踴而至，大家都存着恐懼之心，拼命爭取時間，唯恐白白浪費那五分鐘或十分鐘。</p>
<p>他們的校舍，說來好笑，比不上一家大舞廳或電影院的面積，就是這麽一塊地方，你竟想不到會有數百靑年男女濟濟一堂的孜孜求學。</p>
<p>悠靜孤獨的亞爾培路南段，一條平坦光滑的柏油路上，全滬音樂演奏聖地逸園的對門，中法藥專校舍的東南角，一棟赭色半洋化的平房里，我們不可漠視，那裏有着大批未來的新戰聞士在成長羞，他們是繼娥與開拓新中國新聞事業的先鋒。</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>在一年一度開始的時候，預算的制定，可以說是數量重要的工作，因爲一個仔細擬訂的預算表，具有下列的利益：</p>
<p>（一）她可以使流動資金的運用，最合經濟之道，就是以最省的流動資金產生最大的工作效能。</p>
<p>（二）因爲由各部主管人員共同擬訂，可以避免不必要的損失和耗費。</p>
<p>（三）各部份的責任分明，響如說預算表中的製造費用是多少，等到實際製造的時候，突然超過預算，就可以硏究其所以然。</p>
<p>（四）一個詳盡的預算表，可以使各個部份嚴密合作起來。</p>
<p>（五）一個預算表中所列的各點，可以使主管人員一目了然，一個部份多用了錢就可以立時發現。</p>
<p>（六）有了預算，就可以和決算相核對，由此也可以顯出主管人員，眼光怎樣。</p>
<p>（七）預算表可以帮助主管人員考核推銷，製造和經濟調度的方針，是否合理。</p>
<p>（八）一個主管人員，有了預算，非要時常査核市面情形不可，因而可以規劃各種事業上必要的擴展。</p>
<p>（九）有了預算表，主管人員必須對於原料勞工和其他開支，力求節省，以期符合預算。</p>
<p>（十）有了預算表，可以有一個根據，對於以後各個年度都可以按照着實行。　按照目前的情形，因爲情形隨時在變更，預算的時期不能過長，可以定爲三個月或六個月。</p>
<h3>明日的生產者——自動工廠</h3>
<p>— 陳湘譯</p>
<p>想像一所潔凈而寬敞的工廠，在地板上無人工作，僅有九個技師在上面的高臺上踱着，留意着控制機。原料由輸送機運進去，經過一列機械之後，就放出製好且已包裝了的產品——無綫電，冰箱，自來水筆，牽引機，或者其他你想生產的東西。</p>
<p>這所明日的工廠與現在的工廠有所不同，正如一座水力電廠與舊式的用一排汽鍋和用人添煤的水汽發電廠有所不同。</p>
<p>近代的人在工廠的生產的地板上較其他地方爲無用。我們早已有了比眼睛看得更淸楚，比腦子計算得更可靠，比記憶記錄得更準確，和比手工作得更快且更好的機械，這些器具從不感到飢餓和疲勞。它們能够做一個工人所做的任何的事情，而且做得快，好，繼續不輟。</p>
<p>戰時人工缺乏此種制度萌芽</p>
<p>戰時的「繼續流動制度」（Continuous-flowsystem）使化學品，煤油，橡皮和原子彈原料成爲完全自動的生產。</p>
<p>完全的自動工廠需要三個機械單位的基本的表象：這些今天都已存在。第一，一定要有發出和接受通吿的器械。這種東西我們早已有許多了。例如：我們用光電池一看」以爲校勘之用；微音器和振動測量器找出壓力的差異，還有幾乎令人難以置信的計算精確的電子管計算機。</p>
<p>第二類基本的機械單位是一個電子的器械，能够接受通吿，並逐一轉達給對正確製造物品的機械的控制的機力。這種設備現在巳廣大的被應用着。</p>
<p>第三類基本的機械單位担任眞正的製造工作。它們的應用很廣，祖任着切割，定型集合和油漆人造物等工作。</p>
<p>在許多情形之下，工業界用自動機械做各種特殊化的工作。作者建議將一些這種機械聯合成一組，用以生產及配合一個完全的生產品。這種完全的生產機械將極可以應用，它的組成者能够容易的加以重新佈置，造成一個完全不同的効果。</p>
<p>機器人從事生產</p>
<p>對於自動的生產予以多方面的應用，我們建議一種我們所稱的「手臂機械」。基本的它由一個有關節的臂所合成，嵌在一個轉盤上。自由的一端裝置一個特握的固定物——緊握的掣子，虎頭鉗，或者磁石，視工作的性質而定。在底部是機械的構造使臂在樞軸上轉和彎曲，並移動持握的固定物，這種機械能像工人手臂一樣的動作，手的本身能在腕部旋轉。它的模型早已製成了。</p>
<p>假定我們要造某一部份，譬如說一個內部有縲絲以握住電話聽筒的微音器的銅圈。工作程序記錄在一張穿孔的捲筒紙上，利用紙上的孔，通訊給「工作機」：必須將生銅管製銅圈。一個通吿的單位，將紙孔所表示的意義，迻譯成電的衝動，傳達到「手臂」和「製造機械」。在製造過程中，紙孔能指揮在持握固定物上工具的變更。製成的銅圈在輸送帶上經過檢査機，如果有任何缺點便被拋棄，否則就輸送出來</p>
<p>自動工廠是由許多生產機械單位組成的。如同前面所敍述的一種，每一單位成一簡單部份，由一個中心的支配控制機（Control　panel）將之結合起來。</p>
<p>一個充分的利用這種自動機械的報織將與現在的大大不同，它將造成一個新的工業的秩序。每天生產二十四小時，工廠將大量的供給廉價的貨物。貨物的品質也將較佳，因在製造時，機械工作得更精密。</p>
<p>基本的機械單位的更迭能力使製造商不怕遭逢市塲的突然的變化。假如要製造異類的生產品，在控制機上有說明書，技師可以將生產單位從新裝置，然後繼續的工作便可重新開始了。</p>
<p>這種更迭的能力，使新產品問世得快些。在現在的工廠中，如實現新的計劃，製造商必須拆除他的大部份的機械，在時間與金錢方面都極不經濟。</p>
<p>新的工業革命　將使平民富有</p>
<p>在戰時，工業界在三年中製造了過去三十年更根本的新的產物。除非我們建立一種適於變動的機械生產的制度，我們不能迅速的獲得真正的新的汽車，火車，冰箱和住宅。</p>
<p>自動工廠可能造成暫時的失業的風浪。但是鉅額的利益是無此的。管理機械總比管理人好。到結了，這種新的機械唯有大量僱用和一個大量市塲才有價値。自動生產的發展需要有高等技能的技師和管理者。利用訓練的程序，較短的工作週期和其他的策謀，可以將過渡時期的震盪穩定下來。</p>
<p>自動生產制度的潛伏的知率，使每週工作二三天的理想可以實現。它的低廉的成本能够予工人以較高的工資，對消費者也有更大的價値。所以人類的生活水準一定要比現在高。新機器能够使工人永遠的從苦悶的，單調的勞動中解脫出來。</p>

<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>（四）雇用以後</p>
<p>在雇用了職工以後，那末一個企業組織，終希望他們能够安心做事，得到　進的機會，因此幾件事是應該注意的，第一點，就是考勤，在人事部分，應該備有考勤的記錄，通常工廠用木牌，在上工時收取木牌掛起來，或者用簽到的方法，最進步的是用打時間的鐘，每一個工人在上工退工時，都要在卡上打上時間，到了月終以前，交給人事部份去核對有沒有遲到早退的情形，在人事部分裏，最好，每一個職工有一張表格，格式如下：號碼姓名日期12345一月二月三月總共工作日數缺席日數出席百分比</p>
<p>在方格裏面，遇有遲到早退或請假情形，就用紅筆做一個記號，譬如AS代表病假，，AN代表無故缺席，ES代表因病早退，EN代表無故早退等因爲每一個職工，在假的時候，應該備就請假單，交工作部分簽字以後轉往人事部記錄起來。　在一般企業組織裏，都定有規則，凡一年之間，沒有請假的，有相當的獎賞，如加薪一個月等，對於缺席過多的人，也有扣除薪金等懲罰的條例。第二點要考慮到的是薪給和生活的情形，在企業組織方面着想，當然希望最低的代價雇用職工，是因爲工資低微，開支較省成本小較輕，但一方面應該爲職工着想，不能因爲節省開支，而不顧到生活程度，所以當生活程度高漲以後，應該自動增加，使職工可以安心工作，在開始雇用職工之後，使他們長時期的工作，也是很重要的，有許多企業組織，規定凡工作滿十年約有多少獎金可得，工作滿廿五年約有多少獎金可得。</p>
<p>第三點要考慮到的，是升調的問題，每一個人都是具有向上的心理的決沒有人會願意永久做低微的工作，所以當一個職工是勤勞的或者做了特殊的貢獻的時候，就應該給予金錢，或升級的獎勵，在升級或調動的時候，就要影響到人事部分所做的記錄，因此就應該由工作的主管部分用通知單的方式，送交人事部分使人事部份可以在記錄上加以更改。</p>

<h3>四川的山　　桐窗雜憶之一</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>常聽人說，「桂林山水甲天下」，我一直憧憬着廣西的山水，但直到現在沒有能夠去遊歷。有些朋友說，桂林山水這奇特，不過都是平地上聳立起來的石筍，形狀突元，所以出奇，如果當作畫面似的風景看，就乏味了。我是特別喜歡風景的一個人，所以，我前常喜歡「野外寫生」，近來常畫中國畫，也喜作山水。曾經，小時候看過許多山水古畫，使我悠然神往，想住在叢山峻嶺之中，聽着松壽，望着流水，是多麽幽靜的生活。這當然是一種想像，但我却從不懷疑，畫面上那樣的山水，並非眞實境界。這次，從西北到四川來，在路上，看見那些山水，格外相信，那些前人的名作，並非虛構了。誰說中國畫歷現實太遠呢？限於一條長條子的格式，而在那上面構出畫來，中國山水畫有這一種特長。四川這一帶的山水，最宜乎這樣的佈局。這可以證明中國從前的畫家，大都取材於自然界，並非依據成法，在紙上捏造天地，而一個畫家的遊歷名山大川，是最必要的修養。寫史記的司馬遷，幾乎遊遍了漢朝中國的本部，所以他的文章浩肆旁礴，為古文的宗師，那末，畫家中的關仝，馬遠之輩，又何嘗不是履行家。實在，四川這一帶的山，太使我戀戀不捨了，長松，翠柏，高峰，峻嶺，叢巒，壘崗，亂石，怪樹，瀑布，靑溪，白雲，朝霧，竹林，村舍，急流，狂喘，幽禽，野鳥，充塞在這一帶的山間，人在這裏而走，「如行在圖畫之中」，眞有這種情形。</p>
<p>我做夢也沒有想到四川來，感悟日本人，把我從西北逼到這裏，看到這許多山水，是我莫大的收穫，我沒有到過四川的全部，相信，在我走過的地區外，還有更好的山水，從地圖上看起來，中國的山脈，原來擠在西南這一帶。世界上山脈的聚結處，也在歐亞交界的地方。當初地球發冷的時候，特別在這一帶凝結起許多皺紋和　瘤，成了我們愛看的許多風景，而中國的版圖，也切到了這幽靜的一部，使我在本國的土地上，尋覓出許多畫材，這實在是一種幸福。</p>
<h3>新年</h3>
<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>砲聲沉寂幾天了。</p>
<p>火綫像是轉移到別的地方去，然而，火綱內的駱家村還是只有駱老頭自己。這是一位硬朗而又倔強的老漢，他十八歲時因為和家裏淘氣，在軍隊裏一混便是十幾年，他的足跡踏遍了西北與江南。張勳復辟一役，左手掛了彩，他回家來了。他改穿舊衣，重新荷起農具，安份的度着傳統的耕者生活。每在秋收無事，天寒夜長時，他格外受村鄰的愛戴；那間牛屋—他的臥房，中間有一團熊熊的火光，周圍擠滿了靑年人，孩子們，靜靜的，在辟拍的火聲中，傾聽他述說十幾年離奇古怪的遭逢。</p>
<p>「看吧，我們終歸會勝的。」</p>
<p>憑他的經騐他有充分的自信力，他的話總是肯定的。勝利果然到臨了，他買些香燭紙砲，敬天地，拜祖先，欣歡欲狂。但，半年後駱家村又打起仗來，這是他想像不到的！他大兒子當兵至今未回家，小兒子又給編組了去。駱家村在火綱內，什麼全給打得稀爛；山上駐了兵，無法進去，祇得呌老伴帶着媳婦孫兒到沒戰爭的地方去人。那老嫗經不起風霜饑餓，一月之後便死在路上。駱老頭得到這消息，他鬆下口裏的旱烟袋，垂着頭，輕輕太息一下：</p>
<p>「世道變了！」</p>
<p>中然心酸一陣，但他並不失望，他想：六十年一個甲子，變亂總有平復的時候。他活着依然很在勁兒。這村上固然只剩他一個人，他還是勤勤快快的過日子，他們可憐的幾畝地，都用手播種上小麥，已是綠油油的一片。其餘的—那廣大的地面全荒廢着迪倒使他感到無限的心傷。</p>
<p>「唏！」</p>
<p>他噓了一聲，旱烟袋又塞進嘴裏。</p>
<p>這天陽光很好，風沙小，室外不大冷，駱老頭像平素的晴天一樣，安閒的坐在門外石滾上取　。經騐告訴他，今天正是大年初一，他立刻站起來，將他噓了一聲，旱烟袋堅在石滾旁，握起破掃帶，把兩間歪斜的屋子掃得乾乾淨淨，又掃了一掃院子；洗過手臉，對着房內後牆上那張陳舊的「駱氏三代之神位」的葒紙簽恭敬的磕了三個頭，然後拍拍膝前的灰　，出了門，提着旱烟袋，蹲在門檻抽起來。</p>
<p>「我也算過了年了。」他自言自語着。</p>
<p>抽着烟，駱老頭展眼向郊外瞭望着，從村莊到村莊，房子，祇剩下一些傾圮的帶烟熏的山牆；樹木焦爛的立在地上，沒有人畜，聽不到犬吠鷄鳴，看不見一縷炊烟，無邊的灰黃色，極目蒼閔！轉眼看看駱家村，一樣的，什麼也沒有：他的屋子還是三個月前自己用樹枝亂草搭起來的。往年鬼子橫行時，兵一退大家全搬了回來，理墻蓋屋怪有心勁，現在呢，人一去更不回來了！這裏簡直成了荒草湖坡。他不懂這是什麼意思？為什麼破壞得比敵人佔領期間還厲害！人逃光了，地荒着，大家都沒有糧食喫！…………</p>
<p>「我不懂！」</p>
<p>從前鬼子呌他們修路，每回全村最多去上三二十人，敷衍敷衍。等到晚上，國軍破路的命令到達，沒老沒少，不分男女，扛起傢伙一窩蜂樣的全湧去扒路，天剛亮，大夥又一起喜皮笑臉的跑回家。這會兒世道變了，人都給攪擾得逃光了！……反正他十年八年不會死，到底怎麼一回事他還可以看得見。他希望着，希望總有一天駱家村能夠恢復原狀。</p>
<p>遠遠的，有一個藍色的人影移動着，駱老頭吃力的望着，他不大信任自已的眼睛，這地方會有誰來？待走近時，他看到那個穿着不相稱的藍棉袍的是他的大兒子，背着一個包袱，老遠的就喊：</p>
<p>「爸爸，爸爸！」</p>
<p>老人輕輕的答應一聲，對於兒子的歸來，他並不感十分興趣；他希望的是全村親鄰都能回來。一見面兒子便問道：</p>
<p>「他們呢？」</p>
<p>「回頭再說。」</p>
<p>兒子取出包裹裏的麵粉，豬肉和一瓶高梁酒，放在門後；父子兩人開始談起來，駱老頭先說到兒子離家後村上的情形。接着，大兒子說他已經正式升了班長，因為離家近，連長特許回家看看。他父親問他目前為什麼還在打仗，他回簽不出所以然來。談了半晌，駱老頭沒得到一點自己希望的事物；他轉了話題，要求大兒陪他做飯。</p>
<p>飯剛做好，小兒子也化了裝加到家。他帶了一些食鹽和兩條土造烟。父子三人坐在一起，吃着飯，他們唱完那一瓶高梁酒，小兒子如同對部下一般的，誇張的講着他們的日常生活，起初駱老頭聽得有趣味，及至小兒子一再重複說着，老人臉色漸漸現出一層厭煩，他不怏意的說：</p>
<p>「虧你生張好嘴巴！」</p>
<p>「什麼？……」</p>
<p>小兒子想還嘴，但祇說一聲什麼便住口了。駱老頭看看兩個兒子的眼臉；想到被澈底破壞了的村莊，荒廢的土地，餐風宿露逃難在外的親鄰；想到兄弟二人在第一綫，一個娘生的，同是他的兒子，却互相殘殺，針鋒相對，他不禁有些感嘆了：</p>
<p>「好內銷們都回來了，咱們好好的過這個年，以後誰也不許再出門了！」</p>
<p>老人說着走出房門，他腦海裏閃過一個可喜的遐想。小兒子朝着老人的背影說：</p>
<p>「老頑固！」</p>
<p>「拍」</p>
<p>大兒子有些看不過去，他忍不住，狠狠的在他弟弟的腦袋上扔一巴掌；那弟弟暴跳起來，指着他的哥哥：</p>
<p>「奴才，你以為我不敢和你鬥爭嗎？」</p>
<p>「混蛋！」</p>
<p>於是兄弟兩人扭成一團，邊打邊駡，駱老頭一脚踏進房門，摸摸鬍鬚，嚴厲的高聲嚷着：</p>
<p>「不要打，都跪下來！跪在祖先面前，平心靜氣想一想啊！……看看咱們的村莊，咱們的土地；想想咱們的親鄰吧！……再打，連自們這破陋的屋子也保不住了！……」</p>
<h3>茅屋</h3>
<p>— 華風</p>
<p>在這個荒涼的山谷裏，茅屋沉默地蹲在陡峭的山坡上，迎着太陽從峯頂昇起又落下，迎着每一個苦寒的風雨吹打的日子。</p>
<p>當春天姍姍地從山外翻越過來時，給予茅屋以最大喜悅的該是那條淙淙地唱着歌　從它脚下穿過的溪流了。秧歌，收歌，布榖島的啼喚應和着溪流日夜的狂嘯，一串洪亮的靑春底蠱惑的天籟便蕩漾在山谷裏。</p>
<p>是屬於遠祖的年代了，茅屋曾經過有一個光輝的蠍子那時它底主人擁有衆多的牲口，廣大的耕地，驚人的勞力和無數的農具，種籽，肥料………那時日子是熱鬧而忙碌的。</p>
<p>白天，它靜靜地躺在柔和的陽光下做着夢。晚上，當它底主人一個個從田野歸來時，它底寬暢的心上便洋溢着生命底歡呼。大家圍在一蓋森藍的油燈下檢討一天工作的成績，而牛犢們便在矮的茅棚低聲地澌炓着，山谷的夜雖然幽靜，但茅屋是不會感到寂寞的。</p>
<p>現在，春耕的季節雖然來臨，而屋却沒有音日那樣餘款了。因為它知道自己底主人已失去了所有的牲口農具和種籽。………望着那一片荒蕪的耕地，它簌簌地滴下悒　的眼淚。</p>
<h3>白畫像</h3>
<p>— 方棣克</p>
<p>方棣克（Van　Dyck1590－1641）是魯班斯最得意的珍上門人。十九歲就享了盛名，英王Cha．les．L，奉師命辦去英王，漫遊意大利，埋頭研究古代人家；又五年，果大成。三十三歲再應英王聘，為宮廷畫師，賜建皇宮式之畫室於台姆司河畔，製作甚多，代表有「耶穌下葬」，「英王祁爾斯　一世騎馬像」，「聖百代樂受難」等。此為二十歲之自畫像，至今仍在，可謂難得。（獅）</p>
<h3>漫談舞獅</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>每逢夏曆歲首，或是其他的紀念節期，廣東本地和粵僑所在的地方，多有「舞獅」的娛樂，舞獅固可以表示團結，又可以振刷精神，鼓樂的節奏有序，更令人們精神渙發。</p>
<p>舞獅的起源，無書可徴，有說是圖騰的遺跡，也有說是太古落時期出搬獲得勝利品的表示，是否屬實，無可稽考了。舞獅的組織，是由各鄉的祠堂，或武館，街坊等而來。在上海呢，多屬武館，如由什麼社什麼堂做基礎的。獅頭的構造，是用竹片紮輪廓，用紙糊成，塗油彩色，裝毛嵌鏡，耳眼口舌，都能活動。獅身用彩綢製成，尾裝長毛．獅的鬚眉，多屬白色，表示老獅。若果黑鬚黑眉，便是壯年獅中，出外遊行，便常遭遇到好事的鬥爭。所以獅子的鬍眉多用白，就是這個原故。但是有些鄕村或武館，自恃人多勢大，軍器充足，而用黑色眉鬚的獅子，到處挑皺的也有，不過別的獅子聞着它的行跡，住往閃進，不敢正面相偶，恐怕招川死非來，因為以前舞獅的常常借故尋仇鬧事，有時因為舞獅而弄到械鬥，但是這些陋習，近年來減少了。</p>
<p>舞腳是有他的技術·舞獅頭的循着鑼戲的節拍而動作，進退高低，左右蹲跳種種神態，舞獅尾的也同一動作，這非有嫺熟的武技，不能夠活動自如，動人視聽。</p>
<p>每一個獅子，配合的人，最要緊的舞獅頭，必有三四個人輪流換班，其次舞獅尾和準備採靑，上樓台等助手，一個戴着假面具手搖蒲扇作先導的，引人發笑。他如鼓手，鈸手，握手主持樂其。還有許多武士裝束，帶了刀槍，旗幟，錦標，籐盾等，旣助威勢，也是準備萬一的廝殺。說好一點的，是儀仗的配襯，下然，過於單調了。</p>
<p>獅子採靑，是最精彩的表演，在數丈高掛着生菜或其他錦標現款等，舞獅的在鼓樂喧鬧解中，依着法式，踏在竹竿上或人的膊上，或藤盾上，一層一層的上去，表演稱種動作，把兩眼拿着，跳下來在地上慢慢地齧吞，這種工夫，是要經過相常訓練的．一個獅頭有數十斤重，舞獅的旣要把它舞弄，又要使它的口開闊，跳躍護退，或遠或臥，或急或慢，一氣呵成，而不換班。所以舞獅是合作的表示，團結的象徽，如果彼此閒失了聯緊，那就黯然無色，沒精打彩的了。</p>
<h3>參加「作協」年會　南京去來</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>人們都在忙着回家過年的時候，我却像逃難似的擠上了京滬列車，以頭等客人的資格，總算在一節臥車廂的廁所門口，爭得了一席沙丁魚的地位。雖然，飽受車僮的侮辱和八小時饑飢渴；但我們都不在乎。因為這樣的場面，早在前年湘桂綫上體騐過了。況乎我們這次是着滿腔的熱望去參加「作協」的年會，並不是無目的地逃亡。</p>
<p>抵京後，我們沒有受到「隆重的」招待，他們沒有把我們當客，我們也沒有把他們當視為主；彼此享受在絕對自由的氣氛裏。於是，多年不見的老友們都得到了暢談的機會，這是我們亞京的最大收穫。</p>
<p>連下了半月濕雨的白下，今日突地放晴，沒有雲，沒有霧，也沒有太陽，蔚藍的天空，充滿着希望。「作協」年會就在這充滿着希望的氛圍巾揭幕。</p>
<p>會場佈置簡單，沒有總理像，也沒有黨國旗，所以開會也沒有「如儀」。主席是公推的，演講是自由的，選舉是民主的，提案是切實的，聚餐是愉快的，四五個鐘頭的會議，始終保持着旣嚴重而又輕鬆的情緒，一百五十多個會員，都沒有一個現出疲勞的表情。</p>
<p>學術演講有老向，余上沅，陳之佛，許健吾，邵洵美，等。</p>
<p>老向說：以往的文藝作品，可以略分三種形式。</p>
<p>（一）風箏式——淸高至上，與民間僅有一綫牽連。</p>
<p>（二）平行式——文藝是文藝，民間是民間，永遠平行，永不相交。</p>
<p>（三）循環式——作家與人民打成一片，向民間去取智慧。</p>
<p>並且他再三強調第三種形式，他說：我們要使其中外上下交流，城市與鄕村交流，國際與國際交流。散會後，我們都和他開玩笑，稱他為第三種文學作家。</p>
<p>提案很多，最先提出討論也最為大衆肖奮地通過的是上海代表提出的幾個。</p>
<p>（一）請求政府興辦文藝貸金。</p>
<p>（二）請求政府於各地建設文藝新村。</p>
<p>（三）請有關機關飭令出版機關，提高作家稿費。</p>
<p>（四）設文藝獎金，以資鼓勵靑年作家。</p>
<p>假若，我們提出的這些，都做到「義而決，決而行」的話，那末，「作協」可算不虛有其名了。</p>
<p>臨別，張道藩先生說：「作協」是絕對公開的團體，除去把文藝當作工具出賣而違害國家民族的「作家」拒絕入會外；凡埋頭苦幹的純文藝作家，都是我們的朋友，也是我們的會員。</p>
<p>我極同意。「文藝帶有政治性」這話，我不否認。文藝可以表現「政治」，作家可以批評「政治」；決不可附　於政治，做它的尾巴，換言之，倘若「文藝」失其獨立超然的地位，「作家」即變成了野心的「政客」。願我們純文藝的作者朋友，共同操守着這純潔的一點。「文藝」是絕對自由的，決不能把它當作做一架機器上的某一個齒輪，或某一顆螺絲釘。</p>

<h3>腦子越用越靈　懶惰者必短命　長生有術</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>八十二歲的歌德，還具有一種驚人的工作的能力，完成了他的鉅著「浮士德」。八十三歲逝仳的囂俄，始終工作，他充滿了生命和創作的能力。義大利名藝術家米開蘭基羅八十多歲，還努力於他的藝術。法國大畫家柯樂在他的八十大慶那一天繪了他的傑作之一。</p>
<p>探詢長壽的秘密的科學家們，會指出上面所提到的藝術家們從未停止創造的工作。「疲倦」，他們會吿訴你，「是對身體和精神都非常危險的。沒有一個簡單的懶惰的人會活得長，唯有終身忙碌的人才曾長壽。」</p>
<p>這個總括的結論是被德國紐司塔德市的「頭腦硏究院」的奧斯卡博士和烏特博士所證實，他們在與權威的英國的科學雜誌「自然」的一封通訊中，提起了這個。</p>
<p>「假如我們允許我們的腦子懶惰起來」，這兩位德國硏究家說，「我們是在替自已掘墳」。</p>
<p>腦細胞成寄生虫</p>
<p>我們的生命的限度決定於我們的腦細胞的狀况。假如它們被刺激，它們便會被增强，而我們便可以活到成熟的老年紀。假如偸工懶做，它們就退化，我們便活得比我們應享的壽命爲短，這是因爲我們的少用的腦子，已經成了祇吃不做的寄生虫。</p>
<p>在腦子中有好幾百種的細胞，每一種負責體內某一類的活動，聯合起來，它們動作得如同一個超優的總司令部，使得身體的機能安靜而有効率。</p>
<p>當我們三歲的時候，我們就取得我們的腦細胞的終生的一份；它們不能再生產它們自己。在童年時期取得的原始的細胞必須使之直接思想，動作，消化，生長和所有的其他的一個活的身體的複雜的程序。</p>
<p>假使一個細胞死了，我們便永遠的喪失了它；沒有東西代替它的位置。假如有少許死亡，可能對我們的個性或身體沒有顯著的影響。但是，如果整個的一羣死了，於是我們的某些部份便停止作用。所以，假如控制右腿的神經中樞死了，於是右腿就癱了。</p>
<p>烏特說：「長壽的秘訣是以一些工作級腦細胞去做，以增强它們。它們愛好活動並且因快迅而劇烈的思想而繁茂。假如它們從無數的神經擴張受到刺激，它們便能保持極佳的狀况，而你便能過一個有用的生命，遠超過六七十歲的壽命。</p>
<p>反過來說，假如你過一種遲鈍的生活，很少受刺激，腦細胞便少用。在全然的挫折之中，它們變得衰弱和未老先衰，促你死亡。</p>
<p>忙碌人腦筋健全</p>
<p>烏特他們，在他們的實騐室裏覺得：他們明確的建立了這個事實：忙碌的人發展强健而堅韌的腦細胞，這就是說：走向長壽之境。</p>
<p>「在特殊的活動的個人的養育中，」他們結論：「有一種逐漸的延遲正常的腦子的死亡的可能性」（譯自本年二月份「雜誌文摘」）</p>
<h3>吹</h3>
<p>— 王德雲</p>
<p>昨天，我買了一個洋泡泡回來，就高興地「吹」起來了。</p>
<p>我祗輕輕一「吹」，洋泡泡立刻大了許多，好像窮人暴發似的突然胖了起來，再一吹，又大了許多；再一吹，又大了許多許多。</p>
<p>「好呀！好呀！」妹妹拍手佩服我「吹」的本領。</p>
<p>我更自鳴得意了！於是繼續努力，大吹特吹，但母親「旁觀者淸」，不禁爲我揑了把汗，立刻大聲阻住我：「好了！不要吹了！要吹破了！」</p>
<p>說時晚，那時快，話剛出口，祇聽得「啪」的一響，氣球竟應聲而碎！</p>
<p>「完結了，可憐的大胖子！」我不禁歎了一口氣。但球的破碎却帶給了我更多的啓示！</p>
<h3>拜年</h3>
<p>— 索英</p>
<p>——應時打油——</p>
<p>勞命傷財是拜年，多少時間多少錢！只爲人人要面子，庸習陋規甚從前；大家都是「打打的」，何不免俗省「兩鈿」？</p>
<h3>春節話黃金</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>恭喜發財，元寶搭檯。</p>
<p>在陰歷新年，余鄕有「恭禧發財，元賽搭檯」的土語，以祝頌人家新春「鴻運高照」。</p>
<p>在戰前的黄金身價，尤其是「金元寳」，眞可說高貴得非凡，並不是普通人們都有的，但降至近數年來，阿貓阿狗，車夫娘姨，奶媽大姐，那一個不「黄金累累」？</p>
<p>俗諺說：「一兩黄金四兩福」，現在的人，所以都「福份」增高，不過道福份與我儕文化人無關，倒是給一般「用力」的勞工當先佔去！不是嗎？他們和她們身上佩的，手上戴的，黄葱葱，耀炫人目，好不羨煞人也！自新關金券問世，黄金問津者更多，逢此新年，買幾隻金戒，幾件金飾算不了一回事，即使買「金元寳」也不費吹灰之力，不料余鄕（閔行）「恭禧發財，元寳搭檯」之謂，却成了「預讖」！</p>
<p>所以黄金儘管「漲」，就可乘漲而「拋」，而「配」？</p>
<p>在新歲打開報章，就看見傳說：「將有黄金卅噸左右，由墨西哥運來」的消息，道倒是一件使人極觸目的新聞！</p>
<p>同時恐怕黄金不住地高漲，太刺激物價，所以在新歲兩天中，已「拋配」了數千兩，這正是爲發行了新關金券後的「顧慮」，但「漲」究屬「漲」了，不過使外表而漲得緩一些罷了！</p>
<p>「不斷黄金拋出來」，「不斷黄金海外來」，但終擋不住「漲勢」，在這情形之下，對平民生活的飛騰，莫怪更無法「壓低」，「一籌莫展」了！</p>
<p>在民間的黄金，一天多似一天，行見變成了「黄金國」矣！又那裏見得今天感到「困窮」？</p>
<p>但雖然「遍地黄金」，而「飢不得食」，「寒不得衣」，物價與金價得不到戰前的「比例」，仍是嚴重的事實！</p>
<h3>財神</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>您到那裏去？</p>
<p>「年初四」夜晚，家家戶戶，搶放砲竹，迎接財神；是的，這年頭，大家窮够了，誰不歡迎財神？</p>
<p>但是，財神您究到那家去呢？您所帶來的錢財，是否够分給這許許多多財迷呢？你是否根據灶君的報吿，讓「善良」的人，得到財呢？如果是這樣，我要忠吿您：灶君老爺在臘月廿四晚，接受了豐盛的祭禮，悄然上天，胡里胡塗亂奏一番，他顯然是受了賄賂的！眞正需要財神接濟的人家，恐怕根本就沒有錢買豐盛的禮物，孝敬灶老爺。</p>
<p>在一片砲竹聲中，財神，我祖心您：也被大戶人家的五光十色的祭禮迷惑了。要是這樣，恐怕丙戍歲决仍然是「富者愈富，窮者愈窮」！</p>
<p>財神！您到那家去？</p>
<h3>博物哲學</h3>
<p>— 木魚</p>
<p>他雖然張大了嘴，活像政治演說家，大有奧妙似的，實際上不過是白痴，沒有什麼政論的，——除非用棒槌去敲擊他的腦袋，可是也沒有什麽反應，不過回答你一個字：「擱！」</p>
<p>漏斗</p>
<p>借用他的嘴，呑東西到別人的肚子裏去，別人的肚子一吃飽，就把他丢開。</p>
<p>垃圾桶</p>
<p>縱然他本身很潔凈，可是他有這麼大的雅量來容納汚機，他本身遂很自然地成爲一切汚穢的代稱。</p>
<p>唯其是如此，以前銀樓裏的主顧，是體面縉紳之流，現在却轉變了風水，都是短打粗手組脚之輩，這一種的「轉變」，連神仙都算不到有這件事吧？這也是「畸形」的轉變！</p>

<h3>國法尊嚴，公不徇私；　楊森精神，大可效法！</h3>
<p>[</p>
<p>— 中毅</p>
<p>貴州省主席楊森之弟楊傳山，乘乃兄進京之日，假借乃兄名義偸運兩大卡車鴉片，事爲偵緝隊査出，立即電呈楊森，請示如何辦理，楊森覆電嚴辦，該楊傳山遂飲彈舉命矣。</p>
<p>這是一件希罕的新聞。處於只講人情不管國法的今日，竟然能够「大義滅親」毫不徇情，是値得大大宣揚的。</p>
<p>中國人的病根子就是善於「徇情」，施法凶人而異，治罪全看人情。表面似乎格於倫理觀念，實在忽略了「義』字，不但不能「大義滅親」，而且「大親滅義」。</p>
<p>話說回來，楊森這一「大義滅親」的舉動，是應該的！是必然的！本來並不希奇！可是在今日徇私的社會，的確是難能可貴，値得大書特書的。不但値得大書特書，而且値得政府傳電嘉慰。</p>
<p>楊主席雖然格於國法將他弟弟治罪，可是我想楊主席的心中一定很難過的。自己的弟弟死在自己的手中，在倫理上講自不免「殘忍」。可是國法終究是國法，人情是奈何不得的。</p>
<p>像這類情形太多了，我希望有無數楊森！</p>
<h3>恐怖世界</h3>
<p>— 高明桂</p>
<p>科學不斷地進步，殺人的新武器也日新月異層出不窮。第二次大戰吿終後，各國的科學家仍在埋首於新武器的硏究，可見這個世界的背面，依然潛伏着不可避免的戰禍。一月十七日紐約出版的「柯里爾斯」雜誌，載有考克脫奈所撰之一文稱：列密格勒理工大學的蘇聯科學家，正在設法硏究使太陽中足以致命的紫外綫，穿過地球大氣的「通隙」，立刻毁滅任何敵國。如果集中「紫外綫」的力量穿過「大氣」而照射至任何敵國則足以頃刻毁滅該國及其全部居民，其容易有如「摧枯拉朽」。</p>
<p>這種「太陽武器」如果硏究成功，其威脅世界和毁滅人類的力量，較之原子炸彈允有過之。在戰後局勢混亂，歐亞風雲迷離莫測的今日，聞之更足驚心動魄。科學致益人類固多，但禍害的力量更大，今日人類物質文明的享受，已臻於高峯，而生命的威脅，也愈益加重，「文明」和「野蠻」，其間實在並無什麼分野！</p>
<h3>死人眼珠</h3>

<p>納維達州里諾城三十一歲的天主敎敎士安特　德，十年前右自受槍傷失明，最近由外科醫生，將因謀殺里諾城中一婦女被處死刑的兇手屍體上的眼球，用手術裝入安特蒙德的右眼內，三十六小時之後，已能重見光明。醫生原定須經三星期後方可分曉此新手術是否成功，不料奏效如是之快。死後眼珠爲人借用的兇手，係於本月十日在納維達州的「煤氣刑室」內處死。</p>
<p>從前曾經有過這麽一個傳說：一個萬能的醫學博士，爲一個折斷右臂的殘廢者，接上一個已經死去的竊賊的手臂，一個心臟病的患者換上一顆獅子的心，手術都奏效了，而且天衣無縫，但過了幾天，那二個受他手術的人都去找他，那個接上了手臂的殘廢者說，他常常不自覺地去偸人家的東西，而那個心臟病的患者，自從換上了獅子心，一天到晚的只想吃人，那個醫學博士纏得無法，結果自殺而死。</p>
<p>現在那失明的天主敎士的右眼內裝上了一個殺人犯的「死人眼珠」，不知看起東西來，也有些異樣吾？</p>

<p>最近各地法院，大赦令到，正忙着辦理開釋手續，此次被赦者，爲數至衆，洪恩浩蕩，千古盛事，不過這一大批的人，久困鐵窗，與社會隔絕多年，開釋之後，無家可歸者，大有人在，躑躅在生疏的社會中，好像一羣迷途的羔羊，覓不出一條可走的自新之路，固然獲得了自由，却又失去了生存。本來生在這個年頭，「自由和生存』二者不易兼得，因此這批被開釋者，自請回獄者有之，再犯重返鐵窗者亦有之，諸如此類，層見疊出，形成社會上一個畢贅的新問題，不過在這個累贅的新問題中，就發現了「自由和生存』的比重。</p>

<h3>The Outpost of the South China Sea - The Xisha Islands</h3>
<p>— From Our Newspaper's Archives</p>
<p>France is once again coveting the Xisha Islands, which stand at our country's southern end. The Xisha Islands are originally our country's territory, so of course we cannot allow others to lay their hands on them. On July 23rd of last year, Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino declared that the islands were located near the west of Palawan Island and intended to incorporate them into the Philippines, which once caused a dispute between our country and the Philippines. The Executive Yuan immediately ordered the Guangdong Provincial Government to take over the islands, and notified the Taiwan Provincial Government to assist them. On January 6th of this year, Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda, announced that the Chinese government had recovered the Xisha Islands from Japanese occupation. Unexpectedly, the next day, the French Foreign Ministry declared that it considered the islands to belong to Vietnam. Since 1933, France had forcibly occupied the Spratly Islands until 1939 when they were occupied by Japan. In fact, the Spratly Islands are part of the Xisha Islands. Now they are adopting the same old trick of forcibly seizing territory, which is unwise to covet these Xisha Islands.</p>
<p>The Xisha Islands are located about 150 nautical miles southeast of Hainan Island, between 15 degrees 46 minutes and 17 degrees 5 minutes north latitude, and 110 degrees 14 minutes and 112 degrees 45 minutes east longitude, exactly between Vietnam and the Philippines. There are more than 20 islands of varying sizes, all formed by coral reefs. The largest island covers tens of square miles, while the smallest island is less than one-tenth of a square mile. This group of coral reefs scattered in the sea rises and falls with the tide, appearing and disappearing from time to time. In navigation, this is considered a dangerous area, so in 1908, our customs suggested building a lighthouse here. In 1930, someone also proposed at the International Meteorological Conference that the Chinese government establish a meteorological station in the Xisha Islands to facilitate maritime navigation.</p>
<p>The Xisha Islands have significant value in military terms. When Japan attempted to occupy the Xisha Islands in 1938, Japan published in the 326th East Asian Intelligence (April 25, 1939) that "especially for our naval authorities, if France, which already has fleet bases in Saigon and Guangzhou Bay, were to possess this flight base and submarine anchorage, the result would be a new situation in the naval power of the great powers in the South China Sea. From the perspective of national defense, this matter is naturally very important." From this, it can be seen that the matter is not minor.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate this group of small islands isolated overseas that float and sink with the tide. They are also a major source of economic benefit. The geology of the islands consists of sand and guano. The phosphate ore formed by fossilized guano is a famous product of the islands. The Japanese Phosphate Mining Company once set up a bureau here for mining, which ended in the 18th year of the Republic due to the impact of the global economic depression. The distribution of guano is richest on Lin Island, occupying an area of 1,291,600 square meters, with reserves of approximately 32,900 cubic meters, totaling 250,000 tons. There are also many aquatic products in the shallow seas surrounding the islands, such as sea cucumbers, clams, cuttlefish, coconut crabs, coral, hawksbill turtles, seaweed, kelp, sponges, etc. Many people from Hainan Island go fishing there, twice a year, leaving in early spring and returning in early summer, and leaving in late autumn and returning in late winter. Sea turtles are mostly caught in the spring, and clams are caught in both autumn and winter. Unfortunately, transportation is inconvenient, and there is no way to dry them, so production is not high.</p>
<p>Hai Guo Wen Jian Lu says: "Qiyangzhou must be passed by all those who travel to Nanyang. To its northeast are the Changsha and Shitang reefs, and ships should proceed with caution." The so-called Qiyangzhou is the Xisha Islands. It can be seen that in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, our country already had records of the Xisha Islands. But in the Han Dynasty, General Li Fubo had already been there. The attached map of the Sino-French Treaty of Tianjin in 1858 further specified that the Xisha Islands should be included in our country's territory. Our oceanographer published the article "Data on the Time Required for the Building of Coral Reefs," explaining that a large number of "Yongle Tongbao" copper coins were found five feet below the coral reefs in the Xisha Islands. According to Ma's estimation, it takes 100 years for one foot of coral reef to form, so our country has occupied the coral islands for 500 years. This is a good proof.</p>
<p>However, our country has not paid much attention to overseas operations in the past. Even the discovery of these islands, according to speculation, was not by officials of the imperial court, but by fishermen on the coast. But our government has never indicated that it would give up. In the late Qing Dynasty, Wu Jingrong was sent to investigate and plan for development. The following year, Naval Admiral Li Zhun also led troops to garrison the island, raising the county flag and firing cannons, confirming that it was Chinese territory. This was fifteen years before the French occupied the Spratly Islands. Since France intended to occupy the Spratly Islands in 1932, our country has always declared that the Xisha Islands are part of our territory, and the French occupation of the Spratly Islands in 1933 and the occupation of the Xisha Islands in 1938 have not been recognized, and protests have been lodged with the French government. Why is France still using the old tricks of imperialism after today's victory?</p>
<p>Since the Xisha Islands are our country's territory, after the victory, of course they should still be under our country's control without any doubt. We should, of course, argue on the basis of reason about this French desire, but we must also go a step further and engage in positive construction, building houses, repairing ports, and opening up shipping lanes. It can serve as our country's outpost in Nanyang in terms of national defense, and also generate considerable economic benefits. Do not neglect its value because it is desolate, so as to avoid the occurrence of similar incidents again.</p>

<h3>Central Training Corps Personnel Management Training Class Opens; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Attends and Delivers Instructions, Earnestly Encouraging Members to Work Hard and Endure Hardships</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Central Training Corps' Personnel Management Training Class for party, government, and military personnel has trained over three thousand graduates in its eight sessions since its establishment. The ninth session began classes on the 20th. The opening ceremony was held at the Central Training Corps Auditorium in Xiaolingwei at 10:00 AM on the 26th, with over fifty senior officers, including Dean Dai Chuanxian, and 304 trainees in attendance. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek attended the corps amidst heavy snowfall to deliver instructions, expressing his deep hope that all faculty and students will diligently study personnel administration techniques and establish a personnel system. Finally, he earnestly exhorted the students to work hard and endure hardships so that the personnel organization can become the driving force for building a personnel system, and then politics can be put on the right track. His words were sincere, and all listeners were excited. The ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM. The Chairman's instructions are as follows:</p>
<p>Our country's politics have always emphasized the use of talent. The ancients said that governance lies in people. At that time, this was specifically referring to governance by people. However, laws alone cannot implement themselves. Even in today's era of the rule of law, the implementation and application of any laws and systems completely depend on people. How to ensure that affairs are entrusted to the right people, how to enable people to fully use their talents, and how to improve people's character and develop their abilities all fall within the scope of personnel administration. In all undertakings, if personnel are not sound and properly coordinated, then all resources, time, finance, land, and materials will be wasted. Therefore, the promotion of general administration and the development of various construction projects must first depend on whether personnel management can be sound. Our country's personnel system has not been established for long, and its effectiveness has not yet been fully demonstrated. Lax work, low administrative efficiency, incomplete assessment and supervision, and unfair rewards and punishments are still common today. It is undeniable that personnel management should be actively strengthened to exert its function in order to establish an official system and achieve the effect of selecting the virtuous and capable. In recent years, the government has repeatedly emphasized this, established personnel organizations to take charge of the promotion, and held personnel management training classes, which have gone through eight sessions, with approximately 3,000 graduates. The purpose is to cultivate a large and sound core group of personnel cadres, distribute them to personnel organizations at all levels, put personnel on the right track, and promote political progress. I hope that all comrades will be mindful of the importance of their duties, study diligently, and strive to serve the country. While in class, you must examine your knowledge, review gains and losses, and improve the existing personnel system; after leaving class, you must be steadfast and conscientious in your duties. Within any organization, if one person is not properly appointed or unfairly dismissed, then the personnel manager should regard it as his own great shame, so that the old habits of perfunctory superficiality can be eliminated, and the atmosphere of seeking truth from facts and being accurate and effective can be cultivated, which will benefit the future of national construction.</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief for Refugees in the Pacification Zone Is Actively Underway</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The emergency relief work for refugees in the pacification zone has been underway after more than three months of effort by the Ministry of Social Affairs. In November of last year, the ministry, in conjunction with relevant agencies, organized the General Headquarters for Emergency Relief of Refugees in the Pacification Zone, responsible for overall coordination, liaison, supervision, and implementation. It dispatched supervisors to various regions to provide guidance and established sixteen teams in areas such as northern Jiangsu, two directly affiliated squadrons in eastern Anhui and southern Hebei, and sub-teams and county-level refugee emergency relief committees, depending on the size of the jurisdiction, to handle refugee emergency relief matters in their respective areas. The required emergency relief funds and supplies, including the six billion yuan allocated by the government, 500,000 catties of salt allocated by the Ministry of Finance, 20,000 tons of flour allocated by relief organizations, and 50,000 bundles of clothing, have been distributed to each team for overall distribution. New recovered counties and reorganized areas will be successively distributed after additional funds and supplies are transferred to the ministry. It is reported that from November of last year to the 22nd of this month, a total of 7.24 billion yuan has been allocated to various emergency relief zones.</p>
<h3>Changes in Provincial Boundaries in Northeast China Under Consideration</h3>

<h3>Heavy Snow Followed by Bitter Winds in Zhengzhou Affects Plugging Project; Breach Destroyed by Floodwaters Some Days Ago Has Been Repaired</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 26th] Following days of heavy snow, bitter winds in Zhengzhou have made it difficult to carry out the plugging project at the Huayuankou breach according to procedure. The wooden piles of the temporary bridge at the breach were washed away in five rows some days ago due to excessive water levels, but they have now been secured with wire. One thousand rolls of wire mesh for the riprap have recently been shipped from Shanghai. American advisor Mr. Todd returned here from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 24th. The plugging bureau plans to convene a meeting in the next few days to discuss the plugging project.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Regarding the Yellow River issue negotiated between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Shanghai, UNRRA is mediating. It is reported that both sides have made some concessions, with the government willing to make mutual concessions on the timing of water release, and the Communist Party willing to do so on plugging the breach. Currently, due to the winter season, the water is low and the river is dry, so no serious disaster is expected at present. However, the plugging project is urgent and cannot be delayed. Therefore, water release is inevitable. If a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached in the short term, the spring flood will cause serious disasters from both plugging the breach and releasing water.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 26th] The Yellow River water reached Luokou at 5:00 PM on the 26th and Chuanjiazhuang at 7:00 PM, with a depth of 7 cm and a width of over 50 meters. According to river workers, there will not be a major surge in the near future.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Talks About Impressions of Jiangxi Politics</h3>
<p>Building a New Jiangxi is Not Difficult</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 26th] Xiong Shihui told reporters his impressions of Jiangxi politics. He believes that Jiangxi is an area with abundant resources and rich agricultural products, which is sufficient to be the capital for building a new Jiangxi. Mr. Xiong also said: "Now that the great war is over and the destruction has passed, it is the special time for construction. However, during my return to Jiangxi this time, I saw barrenness everywhere in places like Nanxun, and the people looked emaciated. This situation fills me with grief. Today, the Jiangxi government should focus on agriculture, industry, and transportation as urgent priorities. It already has a new five-year construction plan, and I hope that the party, government, military groups, and the people will all work together for this great cause and not use their limited strength to fight and compete with each other, thereby canceling it out." Regarding construction funds, Jiangxi has abundant mineral resources, such as coal mines and the KVA project currently underway. If one is good at using and developing them, it is not difficult. Given the current economic situation of the central government, it has little power to assist local undertakings. We must strive for self-reliance and strive for foreign investment and the assistance of overseas Chinese capital. As long as we can guarantee the safety of foreign capital, it will not be difficult to absorb foreign assistance. Mr. Xiong also discussed the recent situation of industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China, saying: "Although the industrial and mining enterprises in various places have been damaged by the Communist army and transported by the Soviet Union, the foundation still exists and is sufficient for new talents to learn. If anyone is willing to go to Northeast China for internships in the future, I am willing to help them so that they can return to the province after completing their studies, which can solve a part of the problem of technical talents." Mr. Xiong also emphasized that in future governance, one should give to the people and not take from them again to alleviate the suffering of the people, and one should also assist the development of private enterprises in various ways to stabilize society and help promote Jiangxi's five-year construction plan. Mr. Xiong is scheduled to return to his ancestral home in Anyi on the 28th to sweep the tombs.</p>

<h3>Coal Shortage in Northeast China Remains, Transportation Semi-Paralyzed; Communist-Controlled Locomotives Use Firewood Instead of Coal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun Dispatch, 26th] The climate in Northeast China has been unusually cold in the past ten days, with daily temperatures averaging below -30 degrees Celsius, and the coal shortage remains, causing railway transportation in Northeast China to be in a semi-frozen state. Due to insufficient locomotive coal and the poor quality of the coal, passenger trains between Changchun and Shenyang, and Changchun and Yingkou often experience delays, with delays lasting up to ten hours or even a day and night. The passenger train from Changchun to Nankai this morning has not yet departed by late evening due to insufficient locomotive coal, which is unprecedented in Northeast China's railway transportation. As for the railway locomotives in the Communist-controlled areas of Northeast China, most use firewood instead of coal, and can only travel 20 to 30 li per hour. There are no heating pipes in the cars, and passengers are like sitting in a cold palace.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Hanoi Leave Dangerous Areas; French Government Allocates 5 Million Francs to Distribute to Our Refugees Crossing the Border; Losses Suffered by Overseas Chinese Will Be Separately Compensated by France in the Future</h3>

According to the recent agreement established between China and France, the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Tonkin and northern Vietnam should be protected by the French side. The French authorities have now taken various steps to quickly provide relief to Chinese refugees, such as establishing shelters in Hanoi and distributing food.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Listen to the People's Voices!</h3>
<p>Since the new peace talk proposal put forward by the government was resolutely rejected by the CCP, the glimmer of hope in the eyes of us ordinary people has also vanished. At the same time, due to the persistent prejudices of the Democratic League and the hesitant inaction of other political parties, the reorganization of the government cannot be realized for the time being. Looking again at southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, the Communist army's offensive is becoming more and more fierce. The Communist army in the Northeast is also sharpening its swords and preparing to try its strength. All of this is more than enough to prove that the CCP has absolutely no intention of abandoning its armed separatist regime. It still wants to use war to promote the collapse of the domestic economy and achieve its ambition to seize power. Therefore, the flames of war in the country not only have no possibility of being extinguished, but the current military conflicts are even more at risk of escalating into a full-scale war. However, today's China is a country that has been weak for a hundred years. After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, it is already exhausted and urgently needs to recuperate and restore its national vitality. How can it endure the catastrophe of internal strife again? Therefore, the current domestic situation not only makes the people of the whole country feel deeply distressed, but is also a matter of concern to friendly countries.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the danger of national affairs, first telegraphed the country, advising both parties to immediately stop their posts, resume peace talks, and reorganize the government, so as to actively carry out preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism. The 173 trade associations in Shanghai also responded to the Municipal Council the day before yesterday, telegraphing the people of the whole country to call for peace. Yesterday, Wang Xiaolai and other giants from all walks of society and industry and commerce in Shanghai issued a declaration, calling on both parties to immediately cease fighting on the spot. These are all calls for peace from the people of the country. Internationally, Marshal Ma has returned to Washington to take up the post of Secretary of State. He is currently consulting with President Truman and the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties so as to adopt a bipartisan policy towards China. Even the United Kingdom, which has no time to take care of itself, has expressed great concern about the current situation in China. The remarks made by Labor Party member of the Upper House, Lin Binxun, advocating intervention in China's internal affairs, although they are a wrong view of the Chinese political situation by Congressman Lindsay, can also reflect how British people are concerned about Chinese politics. Therefore, from the domestic public opinion, we see the international opinion. It proves that Chinese and foreign people all hope that China will immediately stop the war, resume peace talks, and reorganize the government, so as to embark on the road of peaceful reunification, democracy, and national construction as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Since the government completed the constitutional drafting work at the National Assembly and closed successfully, it has been in contact with all parties, trying to resume peace talks and reorganize the government simultaneously, in order to make the country resolve conflicts into friendship as soon as possible. It not only accepted the opinions of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, but also expressed considerable concessions to the two demands insisted upon by the CCP, and drafted a new plan for resuming peace talks, and wanted to send General Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an for negotiations, but unexpectedly it was resolutely rejected by the CCP, completely closing the door to peace talks that had been opened. This fact is very clear in the eyes of us ordinary people. We know that the government is not only very sincere about resuming peace talks this time, but also has great determination. As for why the peace talks cannot be resumed this time, the CCP must be responsible. Because in the minds of us ordinary people, our views on national affairs are very simple. What we hope for is peaceful reunification, democracy, and national construction. What we demand is of course an immediate ceasefire and resumption of peace talks. Regardless of how reasonable the two conditions put forward by the CCP are, we still feel that making demands before resuming peace talks is simply a manifestation of no sincerity. "Without sincerity, there is nothing." Even if peace talks without sincerity are reluctantly resumed, they will be of no benefit to what we ordinary people hope for and demand. The CCP has always boasted of democracy, saying that any measures are based on public opinion. But why can't the CCP listen to the appeals from our ordinary people's conscience?</p>
<p>As for why we ordinary people are so urgently calling for peace? A declaration issued by Wang Xiaolai and others said, "The people of the whole country are about to be unable to survive. Due to the war, tens of thousands of compatriots continue to be displaced. Due to the war, transportation is blocked, currency is constantly inflated, people are unemployed, and industry and commerce are bankrupt. Therefore, we cannot but painfully issue a call of conscience, demanding an end to the war and demanding a restoration of peace." In the eyes of the CCP, these painful words may even be what the CCP is seeking but cannot obtain. When Marshal Ma was leaving China, he issued a statement, frankly pointing out that the CCP's conspiracy was to promote the collapse of the domestic economy through war, so as to achieve its goal of seizing power. But we want to tell the CCP frankly that this "bitter trick" is absolutely impossible. May I ask, what is the use of the CCP even if it seizes power after killing all 450 million people in the country? Therefore, we want to advise the CCP not to put the interests of the party above the interests of the country and the nation! Even if it wants to achieve a certain goal, it cannot use any means. To be honest, the CCP's achievements today were not created by its military force, but by the support of a portion of the people. If the CCP disregards the lives and deaths of the people and remains obsessed, it will be tantamount to cutting itself off from the people of the country. A political party that has broken away from the people cannot stand its ground, let alone have a bright future. Therefore, we want to advise the CCP to take a broader view, calm down, and listen to the voices of the people of the whole country. What is it that they hope for and what is it that they demand?</p>
<p>As for the Democratic League, we have read the full text of the political report of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League, and we agree entirely with the Democratic League's views: "The country must first have peace, and then the country can have unity and reunification; the country must first have unity and reunification, and then it can implement constitutionalism and realize democracy." Not only do we express our complete agreement in principle, but we also believe that this is especially appropriate at this time and should strive for its realization. Unfortunately, the actual behavior of the Democratic League is contrary to its views. The most urgent demand of the people of the whole country at the moment is to immediately cease fighting on the spot and quickly resume peace talks. Isn't this a demand that the country should have peace first? However, in this resumption of peace talks, the Democratic League obstinately adhered to its prejudices and failed to fulfill its responsibilities as a third-party mediator. Instead, it deliberately interpreted the CCP's actions, which violated public opinion. It is really incomprehensible. Moreover, the Democratic League has also adopted a lukewarm and uncooperative attitude towards the reorganization of the government, making it impossible to break the current domestic deadlock. The Democratic League claims to be committed to the spirit of democracy and, according to its interpretation, the so-called spirit of democracy is first acceptance, second mutual concession, and third compromise. But why does the Democratic League insist on its prejudices and refuse to change? Even in terms of supporting the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, we must tell the Democratic League honestly that the government is the one that truly implements the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, while the CCP is only using it as a guise. Therefore, since the Democratic League stands in the position of a third party, it should maintain an impartial attitude. In national affairs, it should distinguish between right and wrong, black and white, and distinguish between right and wrong. It should not have any prejudices. We acknowledge that the Democratic League is an independent and autonomous political group, so we still hope that the Democratic League can act in accordance with its views and seek the welfare of the country and the people. The greatest welfare of the country and the people at present is to immediately stop the war and resume peace. The Democratic League should work with compatriots across the country towards this goal and use the power of national opinion to promote the realization of peaceful reunification and democracy.</p>
<p>In short, the current domestic situation is really too dangerous. The root of all misfortunes lies in the war. If we allow it to spread, not only will the people be unable to survive, but the country will also be in danger of being destroyed by internal strife. Therefore, we have to come out and say to the CCP with tears in our eyes, hoping that the CCP will be moved by the conscience of the people of the whole country and be able to wake up completely, immediately give up its attempt to separate by force, and make the country resolve conflicts into friendship. At the same time, we have to shout loudly and appeal to the Democratic League to abandon its prejudices and change its methods in order to realize domestic peace, unity, and democracy.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Is No Longer Paradise, Hundreds of Theft Cases Last Year, Spring Festival Heavy Snow, Thick Clouds, Prices of All Goods Rise</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch] According to the Hangzhou Municipal Police Department, the most serious aspect of public security in the city last year was theft cases. Statistically, there were 191 theft cases throughout the year, and there were also 25 cases solved in Hangzhou that were committed elsewhere, totaling 216 cases. There were 65 robbery cases, and 28 cases have been solved.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, 26th] It snowed again in Hangzhou on the 25th, and the sky was still covered with thick clouds on the 26th at noon. The prices of rice, meat, eggs, and vegetables have all risen. The People's Food Regulation Committee approved an increase of 3,000 yuan per stone for each stall. The official price of No. 1 rice per stone requires 65,000 yuan, and No. 4 rice also requires 58,000 yuan. Rice on the black market has exceeded 80,000. Gold prices are high and do not fall, 430,000 for refined gold, and 450,000 yuan for decorative gold.

<h3>Issue of Parole for Traitorous Criminals</h3>
<p>Explanation by President Sun of the Jiangsu High Court, Judicial Yuan's Explanation of the Doubts about Confiscating the Property of Traitors</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch, 26th] President Sun Honglin of the Jiangsu High Court gave a separate interview to this newspaper's reporter on the 26th and made some remarks on the issue of parole for traitorous criminals, saying: Parole is an original provision of the criminal law, the purpose of which is to decongest prisons. All criminals who have served more than half of their sentence can be granted parole as an exception, but there must be concrete evidence of repentance, and it is not limited to traitorous criminals. The procedures require an application from a prison official, which is submitted to the Ministry of Justice for approval before it can be implemented. There is no need to implement this provision in the prisons of this province at present.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch, 26th] The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that the confiscation of the property of traitors is doubtful in various provinces, cities, and counties. After the Judicial Yuan's unified interpretation of the laws and regulations, a telegram was sent to the Jiangsu High Court yesterday to inform them that the property mentioned in Article 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors refers to the property exclusively belonging to the traitor, and does not include the property of his brothers. If a traitor has several brothers and their property has not been divided, then the sealing and confiscation of the property should be limited to what belongs to the traitor, but the necessary living expenses for his family should still be retained.</p>

He said that the purpose of this inspection of Zhuji was to urge the engineering office to quickly nail the tracks in the Jinhua section, and it is planned to open it to traffic in March. The Executive Yuan allocated 450,000 sleepers, which are only enough for 30 kilometers, while the Zhuji-Jinhua section is 108 kilometers long, so it is still hoped that the Executive Yuan will assist. In terms of bridges, there is no problem with the contractors. As for the 65-pound rails laid between Hangzhou and Zhuji, it is planned to request the Executive Yuan to allocate 100 kilometers of 90-pound standard steel rails to replace them in order to ensure the safety of train operation.</p>

It was publicly auctioned on the 17th, but grain merchants did not bid due to the lack of a large amount of cash. Civil servants in general are complaining constantly.</p>
<h3>Former Nantong County Magistrate's Major Corruption Case Transferred to Wudi Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</h3>

<h3>Two "Tigers" of Fuli, One of Whom Was Captured</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Suxian dispatch] Wang Shiyunhui, a native of Jiagou District in our county, served as the head of the self-defense regiment of the Fuli Special Zone (directly under the puppet Huaihai Provincial Government) during the enemy and puppet period. His nephew Wang Fulun served as the battalion commander of the regiment and the leader of the plainclothes team of the enemy's Komatsu unit. They colluded with each other and acted as lackeys of the enemy. Countless families of our anti-Japanese personnel and civilians were victimized. Everyone was indignant. They were known as the two tigers of Fuli. After the victory, Wang Yunhui fled without a trace. Wang Fulun used a false name to enter the county training center for training in an attempt to escape. However, he was eventually detected by the victims Zhang Bingqian, Zhou Maocai, Ji Huairong, Wei Yongming, and Ji Shouming and reported to the judicial office. He was arrested on the 18th.

<h3>Ningbo is Planning to Build the Zhongzheng Bridge, Spanning the Yong River, A Massive Project</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Ningbo dispatch] The Xinjiang Bridge in our port is the only way for traffic between the north and south of the two rivers. Once the tide is rapid, ships passing under the bridge often collide and break their cables. Moreover, the cost of repairing the bridge is quite large every year. It is said that it is not easy to point out. The former county magistrate Chen Lin once initiated the construction of steel and cement imitating the Ling Bridge, but it was suspended due to the anti-Japanese war. It is a pity for those who heard about it. It is now known that the local celebrities Jin Tingsun, Zhou Dalie, and Jin believe that this bridge is related to the traffic of the Yong River, especially to the prosperity of the market, and it must be rebuilt. He discussed with local gentry, merchants, and heads of various agencies, and everyone agreed. He also estimated the source of funds. In addition to sending a letter to the Relief Administration to allocate steel and labor accounts, he also requested the Ministry of Communications to allow the Shanghai-Ningbo merchant ships and highway buses to collect an additional construction donation of 10% in order to complete it in two years, and the bridge was named Zhongzheng Bridge to commemorate the Chairman. The preparatory meeting will be convened at the beginning of the New Year to discuss the implementation.</p>

<h3>The Beiping American Soldier Rape of Female Student Case: The Final Act of Public Trial - A Detailed Account from Debate to Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping correspondent, dated the 24th] The American soldier assault case opened for debate on the 21st. After the prosecutor announced the key evidence proving Pearson's guilt, the defense, based on seemingly plausible evidence they had found, tried to argue that the incident was "consensual rape." However, they were ultimately refuted by the prosecutor and presented no new evidence. The court session began at 10:00 AM on the 21st, with a break after one hour and fifteen minutes. It resumed at 1:00 PM, concluding after only thirty-five minutes of rebuttal by the prosecutor. Most of those in the audience were the same faces, except that He Siyuan was replaced by Zhang Bojin. Ni Zheng'ao, a counselor from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and E Sen, the Dean of the Law School of Soochow University, also arrived yesterday and attended the hearing today. This was the most important day, and everyone paid close attention. The judges on the bench also appeared somewhat tense today.</p>
<p>Supplementary Evidence Presented: Before the debate began, the victim, Shen Chong, made a special appearance to present the deep red cotton robe she wore on the night of the incident, which she had previously omitted. She pointed out that several tears at the bottom were not there on that day. The shorts and coat she had submitted earlier had also been washed on the 13th. After about ten minutes, the debate began. The prosecutor first asked the defendant if he wished to make a statement. The defendant's lawyer answered on his behalf, "No." The court announced that after the prosecutor stated the basis for the defendant's crime, the defendant could only make one defense. Otherwise, new evidence had to be presented for a re-debate.</p>
<p>No Consent: The prosecutor explained that, based on the results of questioning witnesses over the past three days, it was confirmed that Shen Chong did not consent to illegal sexual intercourse with the American soldier. Seven Chinese witnesses testified that they saw Pearson pressing down on Shen Chong multiple times on the Jiantan Parade Ground. Medical reports from both Chinese and foreign doctors also confirmed multiple injuries caused by Pearson's rape. Shen Chong had indeed struggled and cried for help under the violence of the two American soldiers. Therefore, it could be judged that (1) Pearson intentionally raped; the third charge of indecent assault could not be established; the fourth and fifth charges could be merged with the second and first charges; (2) Pearson was identified in court as the main perpetrator of the incident that night; (3) Both Chinese and American doctors proved that Pearson's penis had penetrated the victim's vagina;</p>
<p>Indeed Struggled: (4) The victim did indeed struggle under violence. This was witnessed by five Chinese soldiers who were turned away by an American soldier, and the fact that Chinese soldiers with weapons were also resisted proves that Shen Chong's resistance could not have been effective.</p>
<p>Defense: At this point, the defendant's lawyer requested a ten-minute break, after which he announced his prepared defense. He said that the defendant and Shen Chong engaged in sexual intercourse in an area with over a hundred pedestrians, yet Shen did not call out. Seven Chinese soldiers watched, yet Shen did not call out. The sexual act lasted three hours, but there were no injuries to the buttocks. This proves that Shen did not resist. Shen claimed her neck was strangled, but there were no injuries to the neck. The bruises on her legs were only discovered eleven days after the initial examination, lacking concrete reasons. In several of Shen's responses, she used words like "I don't know" and "I'm not sure," which are also questionable. Furthermore, she did not report the rape to the American military police on duty. The case was only reported as a rape case the next day by the Sino-American Liaison Office via telephone, possibly a fabricated plan by Shen Chong's brother-in-law, Yang, etc. "Therefore, it can be proved that Shen consented, and the rape charge cannot be established." At this point, the court announced a lunch break.</p>
<p>Rebuttal: At 1:00 PM, the prosecutor rebutted: (1) The claim that Shen did not call out was false. The testifying Chinese soldiers heard it three times. Strangling the neck does not necessarily cause injury, and Shen's life was in danger at any moment. (2) Witnesses Liu Zhiping, Zhao Ming, etc., all reported it as a rape case. Lieutenant General O'Dowd, on duty, also heard the word "rape" and admitted that he might have misheard it from the word "rape." (3) The three-hour stay was forced by Pearson. (4) There were only two sexual acts in three hours, which was not a long time, and Pearson was also drunk, so it is possible that there were few injuries. (5) Saying that Shen not taking off her gloves meant consent is better interpreted as lack of consent. (6) Male rapists do not necessarily injure their penis. After the prosecutor finished his rebuttal and the court asked the defense if there was any other evidence to present, the court announced an adjournment.</p>
<p>Sentencing: On the morning of the Lunar New Year, the American military court announced the establishment of Pearson's rape charge. The number of people in the audience did not decrease due to the holiday. Upon seeing each other, they exchanged New Year greetings and shook hands to celebrate the victory. After the court session began at 10:00 AM, Lieutenant Young, as usual, continued the previous day's record. Then, the prosecutor stood up and announced the "five charges in the indictment," among which the first charge of rape was established, the second and fourth charges were established, and the third and fifth charges were included in the previous two. He also presented a telegram from Howard, the commander of the First Marine Division stationed in Tianjin, ordering their dismissal. He then handed the original text to the defendant's lawyer, who took it with trembling hands, looked it over with his assistant, and submitted it to the court before temporarily announcing a recess. The judges retired to the courtroom's adjacent waiting room and invited the prosecutor inside for a discussion. After a short time, they returned to the courtroom, and the presiding judge formally announced that "the first charge of rape against the defendant, William Pearson, is established."</p>
<p>Pearson's Expression: Although Pearson's face did not show excessive anxiety, he finally showed unprecedented panic upon hearing the announcement and accepted the verdict as the judge walked down. The court announced that the sentencing portion would have to wait for review and approval. Furthermore, according to law, the case would no longer be publicly tried and could be handled according to law. At 10:35 AM, the public trial portion of the American soldier assault case, which had attracted worldwide attention, was completed.</p>
<p>Hu Shi Breaks the Silence: After the American military court announced Pearson's guilt for rape, Hu Shi broke his silence after several days of attending the hearing. He said, "I said earlier that I believed the American military court would be just, and now my words have been proven." President Hu, like others, expressed satisfaction with this announcement. The prosecutor also said to Ji Yuan, the prosecutor from our local court who was in the audience, that our military court was perhaps too troublesome and trivial. Ji replied very carefully and appropriately, expressing satisfaction with the prosecutor's fair attitude. Regarding the issue of compensation, Shen's father said that he had no idea and did not know when he would file a separate case. Shen Shao, who had always been serious and attentive to the public trial, carried the coat, cotton robe, and white pants that had been used as evidence with a smile, braving the snow and leaving the American military court with the people.</p>
<h3>Spring News from West Lake</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch</p>
<p>Amidst the general economic downturn across the country, the Lunar New Year of the 35th year finally passed. Hangzhou—this paradise on earth—certainly experienced some somber days during the Lunar New Year. However, the past is gone and need not be revisited; we should follow the current path and look forward to the future.</p>
<p>In recent days, paradise has shed its impoverished appearance. Many shops display red paper ingots or red paper couplets, indicating a three-day rest for everyone. People wear new clothes, especially devout men and women, who, despite the heavy rain on Lunar New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year, could not be deterred from their sincerity. They still climbed Jade Emperor Mountain to burn incense, some staying overnight on the mountain, others holding umbrellas or wearing raincoats to cross many hills to fulfill their vows at Three Tianzhu. Some also stayed there.</p>
<p>In the bustling city, the City God Mountain is also filled with incense. Many people hold incense and candles to beg the City God Buddha to forgive their sins of the past year. Humanity truly has a "root of goodness," and they make vows for "goodness." However, the Temple of the God of Wealth is also packed, as people seek prosperity in the coming year, hoping for more gold bars and the ability to buy property. The General Jinhua Temple, not far from Hubin Yingbai Road, is also bustling, as it is said that this Buddha is very effective, granting whatever is requested. When requests are not granted, it is naturally what people call "destiny."</p>
<p>Even in the Lakeside Pavilion, offerings of rice flour ingots, vegetarian ham, and vegetarian trotters are placed before the Guanzizai Bodhisattva. It turns out that the purely vegetarian "Guan Yin Bodhisattva" also desires meat and wealth.</p>
<p>Thousand-Yuan Legal Tender Fades</p>
<p>The custom of New Year's visits is also prevalent. Car services, rickshaws, and hand-pulled rickshaws are doing particularly well. New Year's gift packages wrapped in red paper are piled on the counters of southern goods stores for customers to choose from. Everyone hopes that giving a little gift will bring back a little gift, so southern goods stores are also thriving. After raising prices and "slaughtering the New Year pig," some vendors are now giving a "yuanbao" reward, meaning that giving them a little extra money will instantly turn into a yuanbao. People always love flattery, so they are naturally not stingy with this little money, especially after having passed the difficult New Year season. The 250-yuan and 500-yuan gold yuan coupons brought from Shanghai are active in the market, and many thousand-yuan legal tenders have faded. Several wealthy old men count the bills one by one, and the sounds of "huo, huo, huo" make people envious.</p>
<p>Trying Every Way to Find Happiness</p>
<p>Dance halls, having been reopened for sixteen days, can be indulged in to one's heart's content. Although a cup of clear tea sells for 5,000 yuan, what does it matter when banknotes are like waste paper, flying away piece by piece? Newspapers also report on secret dances in bathhouses. These are all ways to find happiness, and entertainment venues are naturally three times more profitable.</p>
<p>Various agencies and organizations have automatically taken holidays. Vegetables are hard to find, food shops have closed their stoves, and private chauffeurs have taken leave for the New Year. Many plump faces are flushed red, as they have enjoyed feasts in the government offices. On the streets, people push against each other, truly a scene of red-dressed women and green-dressed men. Cars follow car, truly a bustling scene. The long lines of people are all smiling, or rather, they must smile, because "not smiling will bring sorrow throughout the year." The streets are filled with the crackling sound of firecrackers, which is the children's way of celebrating the New Year. The magic of this Lunar New Year is so great. Why? Because China is a rural society. This New Year's rest for everyone can be said to be thanks to the benefits of the rural society.</p>
<p>Wind, Rain, and Snow - A Hint of Spring</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, paradise experienced rain, wind, and snow. According to the boatmen on Hubin, "Although there are still a few days until the start of spring, the rain is continuous, like spring rain; the wind, sometimes gentle, sometimes strong, is heavy, like a 'zhi'er wind,' like a spring wind; the snow, flying and flying, is soft and weak, lazy, like spring snow." Yes, paradise already has a hint of spring. In order to find the news of spring, I hired a boat, sailed on the lake, and walked along Bai Causeway and Su Causeway, carefully observing its traces.</p>
<p>In the distance, a mountain range, the grass on the mountains has already begun to turn tender green. The mountains of Baoshi Mountain and the Chuyang Terrace have already painted the withered yellow color with light green oil paint. The willow trees on the embankment, having shed their pointed leaves, have begun to sprout new buds smaller than grains of rice, presenting a youthful atmosphere when viewed from afar.</p>
<p>Small islands, the Lakeside Pavilion, and Autumn Moon on the Calm Lake have all slowly opened their eyes. They looked at the vitality on the misty lake and smiled slightly, draped in light gauze, and half-dreamingly awakened.</p>
<p>The wild duck flocks, they already know that the lake water has begun to warm up. This lake, which was originally for them to play in, will become a paradise for people. These days, they are gathering to discuss how to steal food from the fields. But people are already planning how to capture them, in order to avoid harming the food supply, and their end is near.</p>
<p>Hurriedly Awaiting Tourists</p>
<p>Jingci Temple, Hupao Temple, Liuhe Pagoda, Lingyin Temple, and Jade Emperor Mountain Temple are all hastily opening their Buddhas for blessings. They have cleaned the Buddha halls and guest rooms, and hired famous vegetarian chefs to prepare for the enjoyment of tourists who come to burn incense in the spring. Shops selling prayer beads, walking sticks, cloth shoes, and wooden fish are all purchasing large quantities from the production areas in preparation for tourists to take back as souvenirs. Walnuts, Xiangfei, nine-flavored olives, and fragrant cakes are all being purchased in large quantities by the shops in preparation for tourists to take back some local products. Incense and candle shops are manufacturing incense and candles in large quantities, believing that this spring will definitely be busier than last year, because they have already devoutly worshiped the Buddhas. Even the photo studios in various scenic areas are also stirring up their spirits and working hard to prepare. Some have been newly decorated, and some have dreamed of importing many materials. This busy group is all looking forward to making a good deal this spring, taking advantage of the fame of the scenic spots and the light of the Buddhas to make a fortune.</p>
<p>Obtaining Snow Waves Brewed from Snow Seas</p>
<p>The wintersweet is already fading. The branches and trunks of several wintersweet trees in Zhongshan Park, with yellow flowers covering the ground, appear withered. The spring plum on Gushan is sprouting buds as green as soybeans, with a crimson color that is pleasing to the eye. Several branches in front of Yue Wang Tomb are also releasing tender green flower buds. The Fragrant Snow Sea of Chaoshan is brewing the moment of fragrant snow waves. They are all telling people that the sound of spring is already in front of West Lake. It wants to come suddenly, but West Lake has already awakened from its hibernation.</p>
<p>This year should be better than last year, right? For the people in paradise, when the news of spring has already arrived, how will you do this year to be better than last year?</p>

<h3>Arab Groups Insist on Their Position: Opposing the Partition of Palestine - London Round Table Conference Reopens Today - The Greater Syria Plan May Be Discussed at the Meeting</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, London, 25th] The Palestine Conference, which adjourned last October after more than three weeks of negotiations without reaching a result, will officially reconvene here on the 27th. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will lead the British delegation. Jewish representatives will refuse to attend, but Middle Eastern Arab countries, including Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Transjordan, and Yemen, will all send representatives.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] British Colonial Secretary Jones met with Hussein, Vice Chairman of the Palestine Arab Higher Committee, this morning to discuss matters. In fact, the Palestine Round Table Conference has already begun this morning. At the same time, it is generally acknowledged here that Britain will sooner or later support the organization of Greater Syria, so that Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Transjordan, and even the Arab part of Palestine will be incorporated. According to news received here, the King of Saudi Arabia plans to convene a meeting of all Arab countries in the near future to discuss this plan. It is rumored that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Faisal may be a candidate for the throne of Greater Syria, but this has been denied by well-informed Arab sources here. Furthermore, it is learned that the Arab representatives to the Palestine Round Table Conference rely on the support of all Arab countries to oppose the partition of Palestine and the continued influx of Jews, and demand the establishment of a provisional Palestinian government through democratic elections, and the establishment of an autonomous Palestinian state controlled by Arabs, guaranteeing the rights of the Jewish minority.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The London Palestine Round Table Conference is scheduled to reconvene on the 27th. It is reported that if the conference fails again, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations General Assembly when it is held in the autumn of this year. According to a representative of the Arab delegation, they will insist on the position they adopted during the first half of the Round Table Conference, and will reject any plan other than the establishment of an independent Arab state in Palestine. The only concession the Arab delegation is willing to make is to allow cities with a Jewish majority to obtain autonomy. The Zionist movement, on the other hand, advocates the partition of Palestine and refuses to accept any plan that does not stipulate the establishment of an independent Jewish state. It is heard that the British Cabinet also has differing opinions on the issue. Colonial Secretary Jones advocates the partition of Palestine, while Foreign Secretary Bevin fears that this move may have adverse consequences and expresses his dissent.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Reverse: Will Be Submitted to the Security Council for Resolution - The Sticking Point Remains the Sudan Issue</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Cairo, 25th] An Egyptian cabinet member disclosed here today that the Egyptian cabinet has decided to submit the current issues involving negotiations with Britain to the United Nations Security Council for decision. Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi will announce this matter in parliament on Monday afternoon. It is heard that the Egyptian cabinet passed the above resolution after a three-hour meeting, unanimously rejecting Britain's recent proposal. This proposal concerns the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations to revise the 1936 Treaty of Alliance, remove British military bases from Egyptian territory, and resolve the issue of the status of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, but it has not yet been disclosed. The cabinet member also said: Egypt has always kept the door open for renegotiations with Britain, but it has now finally decided to submit this issue to the United Nations and stop direct negotiations with Britain. Well-informed sources say that the issue of removing British land, sea, and air forces and their facilities from Egyptian territory can be satisfactorily resolved within 23 years. However, the entire issue hinges on the future status of Sudan. Egypt demands complete sovereignty over this region, while Britain advocates holding a plebiscite to determine the wishes of the Sudanese people. Sudanese leaders want to achieve independence.</p>
<p>British Statement</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Cairo, 26th] The British Embassy here issued a statement tonight: According to political circles in London, although negotiations between Britain and Egypt on the Sudan issue have reached an extremely delicate stage, London has not abandoned hope that an agreement can still be reached. In the past two days, British Foreign Secretary Bevin has visited the Egyptian ambassador to London twice, and the British ambassador to Cairo has also held long talks with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi. In fact, contact between the two sides is still being fully maintained, and both countries are seeking a Sudan plan that is satisfactory to both governments. British officials believe that the door to negotiations is still open today. British officials do not agree with the pessimistic atmosphere caused by the responsible parties in Cairo claiming that the negotiations have broken down. The statement also stated: Apart from the Sudan issue, the two governments have completely agreed on the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. The disagreement between the two governments on the Sudan issue stems from differing interpretations of the Sudan agreement drafted by Bevin and then-Egyptian Prime Minister Sidqi in London last autumn.</p>
<h3>British Criticize Polish Actions</h3>
<p>[Report from our agency] London, broadcasted on the 26th: Brockway, secretary of the Independent Labor Party and secretary of the British Committee of the Indian National Congress, made a speech stating that if the United Nations turns a blind eye to the Polish government's expulsion of German expatriates from Silesia, it will no longer be able to condemn the Nazis. Even the Potsdam Agreement clearly stipulated that such actions should meet humanitarian standards. It is noted that during World War I, Brockway was summoned to court nine times for the crime of "inciting anti-war sentiment." During World War II, he printed pamphlets on the independent labor movement.</p>
<h3>British Plane Crash</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] A "Dakota" type plane crashed at Croydon Airport today, killing ten passengers and two crew members.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Relations: Will Enter a New Phase - Bevin Plans to Discuss Amending the Alliance Treaty with the Soviets - Stalin's So-Called Reservations Arouse Speculation</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, London, 25th] Diplomatic observers here predict that Anglo-Soviet relations may enter a new phase since Stalin accepted Bevin's reaffirmation that the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty is still valid. It is believed that Bevin will take advantage of his trip to Moscow in March to attend the Four Powers Conference to discuss various possibilities regarding the amendment of the treaty with Stalin.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, London, 25th] After Britain and the Soviet Union exchanged notes reaffirming the validity of the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty, Anglo-Soviet cooperation has unfolded in a broad new situation. Observers in both Moscow and London declare that the amendment and expansion of this treaty may lay a brand new foundation for cooperation between the two powers. The British side is awaiting further clarification of what Stalin meant in his note to Bevin when he advocated eliminating the weak clauses in the alliance treaty.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Since Britain and France issued a joint communique announcing that the two countries were about to conclude an alliance treaty, Britain and the Soviet Union have also exchanged notes several times, and Anglo-Soviet relations have thus improved. Diplomatic circles here generally believe that the improvement of Anglo-Soviet relations will strengthen the domestic and foreign positions of Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin. It is noted that a year ago, Anglo-Soviet relations were strained, and the United States also believed that there was indeed a hostile sentiment between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 26th] London newspapers published today generally believe that the letters exchanged between Stalin and British Foreign Secretary Bevin have partly cleared the diplomatic air, but they are speculating about the nature of Stalin's so-called "reservations" regarding the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The diplomatic correspondent of the Observer said that Stalin's reservations can be understood by comparing the Anglo-Soviet treaty with the alliances subsequently concluded by the Soviet Union with France, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The Anglo-Soviet alliance is only effective if Germany or one of its former satellite countries attacks the Soviet Union or Britain. The Polish-Soviet alliance stipulates that the two contracting countries should take all possible measures to eliminate any threat of aggression from Germany or any country that directly or indirectly unites with Germany. In other words, the Anglo-Soviet alliance is purely defensive, while the Polish-Soviet alliance can be interpreted as including the previous war. The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times believes that Stalin's intention is to recognize that some kind of psychological reservation may arise from conflicts in various international arenas such as the Mediterranean, the Tatar Strait, and the policies recently caused by Spitzbergen.</p>
<p>Montgomery's Speech on His Impressions of Visiting the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] General Montgomery recently delivered a speech to the students of Sandhurst Military Academy, detailing his recent impressions of visiting the Soviet Union, stating that Marshal Stalin is an admirable figure, and that Marshal Stalin is currently in good health as usual. Differences in language are the main obstacle between Britain and the Soviet Union. In the future, students at Sandhurst Military Academy will be taught Russian. We need more officers who can speak Russian.</p>
<h3>The Netherlands Makes a Request: Modifying the Dutch-German Border</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, London, 25th] The Dutch government recently submitted a memorandum to the Council of Foreign Ministers' representatives, requesting the modification of six zones of the Dutch-German border from Aachen to Bentham. The memorandum cited geographical, historical, and economic reasons, stating that these modifications are particularly important for correcting the Dutch border.</p>
<h3>Greek Authorities Refuse Entry to Yugoslav Representatives</h3>
<p>[Report from our agency] London, broadcast on the 26th: Yugoslavia planned to send a delegation to Athens, but it has been rejected by the Greek authorities. A spokesperson for the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry recently made a statement on this matter, stating that the purpose of the Yugoslav delegation's visit to Greece was merely to assist the United Nations in conducting investigations into the Greek border disputes. The Greek authorities' refusal to allow the Yugoslav delegation to enter the country is tantamount to disrupting the work of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>The First Draft of the Austrian Treaty Completed - Acknowledging Austria's Independence and Sovereignty - The Decision to Prevent German-Austrian Unification is Recorded in the Appendix - France Will Continue to Submit Memoranda on the German Question</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 25th] The Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies today completed the second week of its preparatory work for drafting the German and Austrian peace treaties. Only one sentence of the treaty has been drafted, and its original text has not been released. However, it was agreed that Austria's freedom and independence should be recognized. This principle was already agreed upon at the New York Council of Foreign Ministers. The US representative, Clark, sarcastically said that this one sentence was a "great achievement." Clark will chair the meeting on the 27th and intends to expedite the proceedings. Clark will add several expert committees to divide the work and cooperate to complete the work of the Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies before the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 10th. The representatives were originally scheduled to meet today to hear Canada's views on the German peace treaty, but the Canadian government stated that it was not prepared to express its views, so the meeting was temporarily canceled.</p>
<p>[National News Agency London, 25th] The four foreign ministers decided today to discuss measures to prevent German-Austrian unification. The British representative stated that such guarantees should be included in a special appendix until Austria can guarantee its own security within the scope of the United Nations. The US representative advocated formulating a plan to integrate the guarantees provided by the Allied countries and the United Nations for Austria's independence. The French representative agreed with the British representative's opinion. The Soviet representative also did not object to including measures to prohibit German-Austrian unification in the appendix.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 25th] The main points of the two memoranda on the German question that the French government sent to the British, Soviet, and American governments last week were announced yesterday. According to semi-official sources here today, the French government will submit more memoranda before the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March, including the Ruhr, Rhineland, reparations, and other German issues. This memorandum will detail France's foreign policy towards Germany as the basis for the Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the German question.</p>

<h3>Italians Dissatisfied with the Peace Treaty - Rumors of Plans to Scuttle Ships</h3>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 25th] The French envoy delivered a formal document to the Italian Foreign Ministry today, formally requesting the Italian government to send one or more representatives to Paris next month to sign the peace treaty. [United Press, Taranto, Italy, 26th] The Italian peace treaty stipulates that the Italian fleet is limited to two old battleships, four cruisers and destroyers each, and other small boats, which has caused a strong reaction at this major Italian naval base. There is much talk about Italian sailors or generals scuttling ships rather than handing them over to the United Nations. According to naval sources, the United Nations promised Italy before the armistice on September 3, 1943, that if it joined the United Nations, it would be allowed to keep its fleet.</p>
<h3>The Dangerous Situation of the United States Requires Strong Diplomacy - Alone on a Prosperous Island in a Sea of Bitterness - Dulles's Wonderful Metaphor</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] Dulles, a foreign policy expert for the Republican Party, who accompanied the US peace delegation to Paris as an advisor, said in a speech to the National Republican Women's Association here today, "The United States now needs a strong foreign policy towards world affairs. We are now in a dangerous situation, on a prosperous island in a sea of bitterness. The tide of resentment is surging towards us, and we are in danger of being swallowed up."</p>
<h3>Relations Between the United States and Argentina Expected to Improve</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall met with the US Ambassador to Argentina, Messersmith, today. The official statement stated that Messersmith will soon return to his post. It is generally believed that US-Argentine relations will soon improve, and the long-delayed Western Hemisphere defense consultations will be held in Rio de Janeiro in March.</p>
<h3>US State Department Official Accuses the Soviet Union of Distorting Facts</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] A US State Department official tonight accused the Soviet Union of directing large-scale propaganda activities in various European countries, deliberately concealing or distorting the statements made by US officials, and exaggerating American life into a strange and chaotic situation in a radio broadcast here. Stone of the State Department's International Information Service, Ries, and Shia of the US Information Service in Rome all stated that the Soviet Union always refers to Americans as "warmongering, aggressive, wealthy, extravagant, and imperialist people." Shia said that, for example, the propaganda organs controlled by the Soviet Union in Romania reported the speeches of former US Secretary of State Byrnes and Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "almost changing the original meaning of the two men." Vandenberg said after the Four Power Paris Peace Conference, "The Soviet Union does not want war," and "The United States does not want war urgently," but Romanian newspapers only reported the words "The Soviet Union does not want war." "This is not a distortion of reporting, it is simply a brutal dismemberment." Byrnes's speech mentioned the withdrawal of troops stationed in Europe and the principle of free trade on the Danube River, but Romanian newspapers did not mention a word. Tonys said that Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart described the question of Poland's future borders, but the communist-controlled Polish newspapers and radio stations did not mention a word.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Longing for their Homeland - Vietnamese Workers in France Eager to be Repatriated</h3>
<p>[Reuters Marseilles, 25th] 12,000 Vietnamese workers are now urgently awaiting repatriation by the authorities. This may be the best example of how Easterners treat Westerners today, and it shows that the East has not been moved by the West. These workers have been in contact with European civilization for about seven years, and they still have no intention of staying. They are now living in camps set up by the French government in various places, one of the largest of which is located in the town of Machag, just east of Marseilles.</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter visited the camp and saw 2,000 Vietnamese living in the camp. The entire camp is divided into seven teams, each with a representative or spokesperson. Each representative thoroughly expressed their opinions, saying that between 1939 and 1940, France recruited 14,000 Vietnamese workers to France to work in agriculture and forestry, etc. Although it was stipulated that they would be sent back to Vietnam immediately after the end of the war, only about 2,000 people have been sent back so far. The French authorities claimed that the delay in repatriation was due to a lack of ships, but in recent months France has transported tens of thousands of troops to the Far East. Where did the ships come from? It can be seen that their words are self-defeating.</p>
<p>It also said: We used to be under French jurisdiction and were treated like slaves, without enough clothes to wear and enough food to eat. We only received two francs in wages per day. The treatment we receive today is quite satisfactory. We have full freedom in the camp to express our opinions and engage in political activities, but we are not allowed to hold public demonstrations. What we want is the complete independence of Vietnam, without any discounts. We have witnessed European nations and politics, but we have not seen anything admirable. Technically, we still need to learn a lot, but we feel capable of creating our own way of life and our own political philosophy. During the war, we heard many words. We believe in the Atlantic Charter and other statements by the Allies that told us that we could enter a new era. The French government was very happy to have our labor and soldiers to help during the war, but now the promises made by France and Britain to colonial nations under the difficulties of war seem to be turning back on their word.</p>
<p>The representatives repeatedly mentioned their hope that the United States would intervene to end the war in Vietnam. They see Britain as a powerful country with colonies, so they have no sympathy for the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people. They are quite concerned about the Soviet Union and communism. Many Vietnamese are particularly moved by the Soviet Union's handling of its ethnic problems. The longer these Vietnamese stay in France, the more determined their will will be. They will not be messengers of goodwill when they return to their homeland one day.</p>
<h3>US Officials Accuse the Soviet Union of Secretly Building Atomic Bomb Factories - US Plans Emergency Industrial Mobilization to Prevent Eventualities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 25th United Press] US Atomic Energy Commission Chairman McMahon said in a farewell speech when he retired that the Soviet Union is secretly building an atomic bomb factory in Siberia. After McMahon's retirement, Senator Hickenlooper succeeded him in his vacancy.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 25th] Robinson, head of the Wartime Army Service Group, said in an article published in the current issue of "American Magazine" that the United States is preparing an emergency industrial mobilization plan to cope with a possible third world war. Robinson said that think tanks from the Army, Navy, and private industry are drafting a secret plan for the entire industrial mobilization, so that American factories can be converted to wartime production in a flash. President Truman is closely supervising this plan. Military leaders fear that another world war is brewing, and the United States may be at a disadvantage. The United States has atomic bombs and does more harm than good. Atomic bombs may not even be used in future wars. The best way to achieve victory and avoid another war is only to make the American industrial war machine ready to cope with sudden changes at any time. The Army Department expects that atomic bombs will be completely banned in future wars. The fear of retaliation will prevent the belligerents from violating the promise to ban atomic bombs.</p>
<p>The United States Keeps Atomic Secrets</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] Former US intelligence chief Wilson has been appointed as a consultant to the Atomic Energy Commission to provide advice on any issues related to keeping atomic secrets.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 25th] Austin, the US Chief Representative to the United Nations organization, said here today to the New York State Bar Association that the United States intends to adhere to its international atomic energy control plan and is now trying to solve the difficulties of "atomic."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency New Delhi, 25th] Madras Province has announced a public safety law, and police have arrested 60 communist leaders in the province in the past two days.</p>
<p>[United Press New Delhi, 25th] The Indian Constituent Assembly adjourned today to give the Muslim League an opportunity to end its boycott and participate in the meeting, and then implement the drafting of the constitution. The next meeting will be held in April, after the Central Legislative Assembly reviews the budget. Before the adjournment, the Constituent Assembly elected various committees and reserved seats for the Muslim League and princely states.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Discusses the Situation in Vietnam</h3>
<p>French Troops Intensify Encirclement of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th] The French government met this afternoon under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Ramadier to review the situation in Vietnam. Chief of Staff of the Defense Guoin, Minister of the Army Floirat, Minister of the Colonies Moutet, and Minister of State De Menthon participated. The Prime Minister is scheduled to meet within days with Leclerc, Inspector General of the French Army Training in North Africa, who recently inspected Vietnam and will report everything to the Prime Minister. Minister of the Colonies Moutet declared after this morning's cabinet meeting that the military operations in Vietnam are progressing smoothly and are aimed at clearing the railway from Hanoi to Haiphong.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 26th] French military war reports yesterday stated: Hanoi continued to be the scene of fierce fighting. The Vietnamese army used houses as fortresses within a one-mile radius near the city center and filled the surrounding streets with obstacles to resist stubbornly. Although the French used paratroopers to drive them out, they have not succeeded. This is the only remaining defense zone of the Vietnamese army in Hanoi, and the resisting Vietnamese army is about 1,000 armed youths.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 25th] The French military headquarters here issued a communiqué at midnight today, stating that the French army in Hanoi is currently carrying out military operations to intensify the encirclement of areas inhabited by overseas Chinese and Annamese.

<h3>China's Exports to Southeast Asia - Sharp Decline in November Last Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Singapore, 25th] Official propaganda: Trade imports from China to Malaya declined sharply in November last year. In October, China's exports to Malaya ranked first among all countries, with a total value of 20.5 million Malayan dollars, while in November it dropped to 6.5 million. The main reason for this decline is the large reduction in imports of fabrics, cotton yarn, and finished garments from China. In October last year, the total value of the above-mentioned goods imported from China reached 10.05 million Malayan dollars, while in November it dropped to 900,000.</p>
<h3>Japan Brews a Major Strike - Negotiations Between the Government and Labor Representatives Yield No Results</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha Tokyo, 25th] The brewing nationwide labor strike in Japan reached a delicate stage today. Representatives from the National Public Service Employees Association, the National Communications Workers Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, the City Alliance, the National Financial Institutions Association, the Ministry of Finance Association, the Urban Labor Federation, Universities, Higher Specialized Schools, the National Teachers Association, the Communist Party, and the Socialist Party held an expanded struggle committee today to discuss and decide on the final attitude, focusing on (1) the attitude during the negotiations with Prime Minister Yoshida on the 25th, (2) the attitude of each union, and (3) holding a discussion with the Socialist and Communist parties. The representatives of each union expressed their determination to carry out a "democratic strike" on February 1st, regardless of any pressure or interference. Kato Kanju, a representative of the Socialist Party, and Tokuda Kyuichi, a representative of the Communist Party, expressed their support for the struggle of the national public service employees one after another.</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese government held direct negotiations with representatives of the National Public Service Employees Association on an equal footing this afternoon. Prime Minister Yoshida did not attend due to illness. State Ministers Shidehara, Uehara, Finance Minister Ishibashi, and Welfare Minister Kawai represented the government. The union side was attended by 25 people, including the chairmen of the struggle committees of each union unit. The discussion of the 13 demands put forward by the union side began at 4:00 pm. The union representative explained the reason for demanding higher wages, which is to improve the work spirit and strive to rebuild Japan. Welfare Minister Kawai said that if the union's demands are accepted, a huge budget of 40 billion yen would be required. Given the current financial situation, the government could hardly accept it.

The date of its departure has not yet been decided, but according to Lieutenant Colonel Santee, Chief of Staff of the division, the division will be transferred to Hawaii for reorganization.

<h3>German Nazi Remnants - Still Trying to Revive - Report of the European Problems Research Association</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 25th] The International Research Association for European Problems, composed of leaders from Britain, France, Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands, recently submitted a report to the prime ministers and foreign ministers of the Allied countries, explaining that the strength of a certain Nazi organization in Germany is increasing month by month. It is said that the Nazi Party has recovered from the initial shock of Germany's success or failure and is now quietly reorganizing in order to seize control of the democratic institutions supported by the Allied countries in order to revive its power. The report stated that this Nazi organization is commanded by old Nazi figures, foreign troublemakers, and German officers. One of them was released by General Clay, commander of the US military in Germany, under an amnesty order last July. The Nazi organization is currently only engaged in passive resistance, and its methods are as follows: (1) Obstructing the Nazi purge and trying to place its own people in important positions as much as possible. (2) Investigating the public and private lives of Germans and using agitation or intimidation to maintain nationalistic sentiment. (3) Disrupting the industrial and agricultural institutions controlled by the Allied countries, increasing their difficulties, and inducing the Allied countries to gradually return control to the Germans. The report continued: According to a thorough study of the situation, with the exception of a few Germans who seem to have sincere goodwill, the majority of the German people have never entered the democratic stage.</p>

<h3>District Chiefs Elections Begin Today - Mayor Wu and Others Will Personally Visit to Inspect and Guide - Expected to be Fully Elected Within Three Weeks</h3>
<p>The district chief elections in various districts of this city will begin today, starting with the first and second districts. The election method stipulates that district residents' representatives will be convened to vote. The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau will also send personnel to the election site to supervise. Mayor Wu, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau Zhang Xiaosong, and others will personally visit the election site to inspect and guide. This district chief election is an unprecedented initiative. The registered candidates have been reviewed and announced. In the past two days, various districts have launched election activities, and the atmosphere is quite enthusiastic. However, it is different from the previous election for municipal councilors, because the district chief election only involves contacting district residents' representatives. According to the person in charge of the Civil Affairs Bureau, in order to carefully supervise the election of district chiefs in various districts, the elections will not be held simultaneously in each district. It is planned to hold elections in one to two districts every day, which will be completed within three weeks.</p>
<p>In addition, the schedule for the election of district chiefs in Luwan District is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 30th of this month. The district has followed the regulations, compiled the register of voters, and posted it publicly at the district office five days before the election. In order to allow sufficient time for the election, the district residents' representative meeting and the district office have discussed and changed the time to 2:00 pm on the same day, borrowing the Aurora University on Chongqing South Road as the venue to begin the election.</p>
<p>[Another News] The Ministry of the Interior recently sent an urgent telegram to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering that district chiefs who are appointed may not concurrently serve as senators. An excerpt from the original telegram is as follows: "Inquiry about the case of appointing a district chief who may be elected and concurrently serve as a municipal senator. According to the instructions of the Executive Yuan, district chiefs and their subordinate staff who are appointed rather than elected by the people in provincial-level cities and directly-administered municipalities are all civil servants. According to the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Municipal Senate Election Regulations, their right to be elected is suspended, and they shall not be elected as senators."</p>

<h3>State-Operated China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Readjusts All Shipping Routes; Hai Xia Ship Trial Voyage to Bangkok; China-Philippines Route Changed to Hai Min Ship</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is striving to adjust all shipping routes in order to develop its business. Schedules were previously established for the Yangtze River route, but due to seasonal and environmental influences, sailings have not been able to follow the established schedule. Accurate schedules are generally expected when the river water rises. The North and South Ocean routes have also been repeatedly reorganized, but without effect due to various factors. Recently, the company has once again readjusted the schedules for all sea shipping routes. The details announced by the company are recorded below: Shanghai-Guangzhou route: Served by the Hai Sui ship, with a round trip every two weeks. Shanghai-Xiamen-Guangzhou route: Served by the Zhongkai and Hanmin ships, sailing opposite each other once a week. Shanghai-Shantou-Guangzhou route: Served by the Linsen and Peide ships, sailing opposite each other once a week. Shanghai-Wenzhou-Fuzhou route: The Hai Hu ship makes a round trip every two weeks. Shanghai-Keelung route: Served by the Hai Qian and Hai Su ships, sailing opposite each other every ten days. Shanghai-Kaohsiung-Hong Kong route: Served by the Hai Yue ship, once every three weeks (trial basis). Furthermore, the Hai Xia ship, previously assigned to the China-Philippines route, underwent repairs in Hong Kong for over two months. It completed repairs and returned to Shanghai on the 20th. Currently, it needs to go to Siam to load rice and is being reassigned to the China-Siam route, also calling at Shantou, Hong Kong, and Bangkok, with one sailing every three weeks. The first sailing to Bangkok is scheduled for the 29th, and passenger tickets will be sold to carry passengers and cargo. After this trial run, it will operate the China-Siam route on a long-term basis. The Hai Xia ship is beautifully equipped and has obtained a passenger license for ocean-going vessels from the British government, meeting modern standards for ocean-going vessels, and is therefore extremely safe and comfortable. The China-Philippines route will be served by the Hai Min ship, starting from Xiamen via Hong Kong to Little Luzon, scheduled for one sailing every two weeks. The Hai Min ship is currently berthed in Guangzhou Bay and will soon sail to Xiamen to begin operations.</p>
<p>North and South Ocean Routes Offer Intermodal Transport</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Tianjin route on the North Ocean line is served by the Qimei, Cai E, Huang Xing, Hai Han, and Hai Jin ships, with three sailings per week. The Shanghai-Qingdao route is served by the Hai Dian ship, once every ten days, also calling at Lianyungang on the return trip. The Shanghai-Qingdao-Tianjin route is served by the Hai Yong ship, once every two weeks. The Shanghai-Qinhuangdao-Huludao route is served by the Hai Kang ship, once every two weeks.

In addition, for intermodal transport on the North and South Ocean routes, goods transported between Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other places can be transported directly by the original ship without transshipment. In addition to the above-mentioned scheduled ships, the Zi Zhong, Deng Yu, Lin Ge, Hai Xiang, Hai Long, Hai Hang, Hai Zhe, Hai Gan, Hai E, Hai Chuan, Hai Ji, Hai Lu, and Zhi Xin ships are unscheduled vessels to supplement the North and South Ocean routes when cargo transport is congested.

<h3>Prominent Figures From All Walks of Life Call for Peace; Launch Signature Campaign for Peace Movement; Hope for National Support; Promote the Great Cause of Peaceful National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Xiaolai, Wu YunChu, and other individuals from the industrial, commercial, educational, legal, journalistic, and professional circles of this city, recognizing that domestic turmoil and war have continued to grow after the victory, leading to transportation obstruction, currency inflation, and the entire nation and people being on the verge of danger, have been compelled to issue a call of conscience, without any political bias, and have launched a signature campaign for a peace movement, calling for an immediate end to domestic turmoil and the realization of peace, in order to complete the great cause of democratic national reconstruction with united strength. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Wang and others specially hosted the local and foreign press at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Club to report on the initiation of the peace movement. Present were initiators Wang Xiaolai, Wu YunChu, Chen Tingrui, Shou Jingwei, Jin Runxiang, Hu Qiuyuan, Duanmu Kai, Chen Zhitang, and fifty to sixty reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers.</p>
<p>Strictly Impartial, Fair, and Unselfish</p>
<p>First, Mr. Wang Xiaolai gave a report, stating that the current peace movement initiated by people from the industrial, commercial, and professional circles, a portion of the names, has already been seen on the Declaration for the Peace Movement, including people from the industrial, commercial, legal, accounting, educational, financial, and journalistic circles. The motivation for the peace movement has been detailed in the declaration and need not be repeated. All initiators believe that peace is of paramount importance for the current domestic situation. Without peace, everything will be on the verge of collapse. Therefore, they have no choice but to make a call of conscience and launch a peace movement. Various industrial and commercial figures have been contacted and considered this matter many times before finally announcing it. This movement does not involve any political parties or government; it is initiated and participated in individually by people from the industrial, commercial, and professional circles, calling for peace, hoping to gain support from all sectors of the country, so as to gather strength and promote the great cause of peaceful national reconstruction. Therefore, the position of the peace movement is strictly impartial, fair, and unselfish. If people from the industrial, commercial, and professional circles agree with this movement, they can sign their names in support. Once the response expands, a peace movement conference will be established. In the future, they will continue to call for peace. Once peace is realized, this peace movement will be declared terminated.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Opinions from All Parties Submitted to the General Assembly for Discussion and Decision</p>
<p>After Mr. Wang finished speaking, the reporters raised several questions. Wang Xiaolai, Hu Qiuyuan, Chen Tingrui, Duanmu Kai, and others answered them separately. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The method of promoting the peace movement is currently integrating the opinions of all initiators, and then submitting them to the future general assembly for discussion and decision. (2) The peace movement does not intend to mediate as a new third party. (3) The preparatory committee for the peace movement initiators, and all rules, are currently being prepared and implemented. The peace movement has not specifically designated anyone to lead it. However, the initiators present today may take on some administrative responsibilities. (4) If the peace movement gains a response from the government and the CCP, it will have achieved a considerable purpose. As for the terms of the peace talks, the overall goal is to be fair and reasonable. (5) Laborers and others must also participate in the peace movement in their individual capacity. As for whether to send representatives to Nanjing or Yan'an to petition, it will be decided at the general assembly. The reception ended at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Peace Movement</h3>
<p>The full text of the Declaration of the Peace Movement and the list of initiators who have signed in support up to now are as follows: After eight years of victory in the War of Resistance, we could have peacefully unified and built a democratic and prosperous country. Unfortunately, domestic war has continued to prolong and expand. The world is celebrating peace, but our country's state of war has not yet ended. A poor and weak country has been bleeding for ten years, and is still bleeding. We will not perish from Japanese aggression, but we will perish from our own internal strife. This is a matter of great pain for the people of the whole country, and it is difficult to endure for long.</p>
<p>The people of the whole country are on the verge of not being able to survive. The status of the country is also declining day by day. Due to the war, tens of thousands of compatriots continue to fall into ditches and scattered in all directions. Due to the war, transportation is blocked, and currency continues to inflate. As a result, farmers and workers are unemployed, industrial and commercial businesses are bankrupt, and all other professionals are insecure. Today, society is disintegrating, and people are uneasy. Not only is political reform and economic construction out of the question, but all abnormal and immoral events will inevitably spread more and more. If the war does not stop, the tragedy of mutual destruction is at hand. If we think about how the international community will soon discuss the peace treaty with Japan, at that time, China, which fought for peace, will not be able to protect the peace within its borders, not only will the reasonable demands be rejected, but it may also suffer unexpected setbacks. Then, even the fruits of the War of Resistance and the future of the country will be completely ruined.</p>
<p>The people of the whole country are on the lines of starvation and death. The root of all misfortunes is war. Therefore, we cannot but painfully issue a call of conscience: to demand an end to meaningless war, to demand the restoration of peace and order. Only then can we complete the great cause of democratic national reconstruction with a unified and united force. We have no prejudice against any political parties. We only ask that disputes not be resolved by force, but that peace be achieved through negotiation.</p>
<p>This kind of call for peace has been made more than once in the past, and all have inevitably encountered various difficulties. However, we really cannot survive, and we can no longer care about so much. We are unwilling to trace the past, and we hope that everyone will not settle old scores. Instead of examining others, examine yourself, and forgive others as you forgive yourself. We are only weeping and saying, hoping to immediately turn swords into ploughshares, immediately stop the war, and immediately resume peace talks. We are all people with occupations and are determined not to be involved in the current vortex of political disputes; we only hope for peace in the world and to live and work in peace and contentment. We cannot sit idly by and watch industry, commerce, and the national lifeline continue to be destroyed by internal strife. We have to stand up and urgently call on all parties to return peace to us; and after this call is made, we will reserve the right to morally criticize the attitudes of all parties towards peace. We will continue to call. Once peace is realized, our movement will be declared terminated.</p>
<p>No ceasefire means destruction, only peace can build the country. We hope that all compatriots in the country, especially those in all walks of life, will unite, use the power of national opinion, the inspiration of national conscience, and the spirit and attitude of fairness and selflessness to promote the realization of peace, unity, and democracy. The revival of the country depends on this one action. The future of the nation depends on it. This is our declaration.

<h3>Ensure the Safety of Passengers at Sea; Ministry of Communications Orders Reward Measures for Rescue; All Boatmen and Fishermen Near Ship Accidents Must Do Their Utmost to Rescue</h3>
<p>In coastal and river areas throughout the country, whenever ship accidents occur, wooden boats, barges, and fishermen moored on both sides often watch the passengers and crew who have fallen into the water without helping, hoping to loot goods. During the collision between the Zhijiang and Huatong ships at the Wusongkou this time, it was also discovered that a large number of barges were robbing luggage and goods. In order to ensure the safety of passengers at sea, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated reward measures for the rescue of shipping accidents and ordered all maritime authorities in the country to implement them diligently: (1) In the event of a ship accident, in addition to the captain of the ship and other ships providing assistance and rescue in accordance with the provisions of maritime law, nearby wooden boatmen and fishermen must do their utmost to rescue. Anyone who rescues a surviving passenger or crew member from the water, after being proven true, will be rewarded with 50,000 yuan in national currency. Anyone who recovers a corpse, after being proven true, will be rewarded with 30,000 yuan in national currency. The above rewards will be paid by the shipping company or firm of the accident ship. (2) In addition to the aforementioned bonus, those rescued or their family members and relatives are free to reward those who provide assistance if they are willing, but the rescuers must not extort. (3) In the event of a ship accident, if nearby ship boatmen and fishermen do not provide assistance, the military police or the ship's escort team may force them to provide assistance or directly take their boats to provide assistance, without any reward after the event. (4) In the event of a ship accident, anyone who takes the opportunity to loot goods and luggage will be sent to court for strict handling once discovered. The local maritime affairs bureau has been ordered to implement this conscientiously.</p>
<h3>Two Robberies</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Lunar New Year, the first reports of robberies in the city occurred yesterday, totaling two cases. One occurred at around 5:00 AM, at the Wang Dayou incense and candle shop at No. 34 Fushan Tang Street, Nanshi. Three robbers first broke in through a hole in the wall, and then used guns to intimidate the shop, taking away 2.4 million yuan in legal tender, which was the money from the sale of incense and candles for the God of Wealth. Before leaving, they also grabbed the gold jewelry of the shop owner Xu Yinqiu and the shop assistant. The other occurred at 8:30 AM, at No. 2 Yuyuan Village, Yuyuan Road, where four robbers took away 105 US dollars, over one million yuan in legal tender, and clothing.</p>

<h3>Western Book Merchants Face Difficulties in Applying for Foreign Exchange; Dim Prospects for Business</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of import control measures, the import of Western books and magazines has been greatly reduced. Foreign bookstores in the city are complaining about business difficulties. Mr. Motiemo, the manager of the Sino-American Book Company, whose main business is selling textbooks and reference books, spoke to reporters yesterday about the situation in the book industry and believes that the future is hopeless. According to him, since the promulgation of the import control regulations, it has been extremely difficult to apply for foreign exchange for Western books, so new books have not been ordered for several months. The books currently being sold are all orders placed before the implementation of the controls. There are also many troubles and delays in settling foreign exchange for the book debts that should be paid for past orders, so **'s invoices have not been paid, which has a great impact on business operations. He urgently hopes that the government will amend the import control measures.</p>
<h3>Strange Guest's Terrifying New Year's Gift; Ambush Outside the Gate of Great China University Fails to Catch Blackmailer</h3>
<p>At the home of Ni Guanqun, a local businessman at No. 1 Sujiaojiao, Changning Road, at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, a man suddenly came to offer New Year's greetings, claiming to be surnamed Li, and carrying two boxes of gifts that looked like fruit. Ni happened to be out visiting for the New Year, and only his wife, Gendi, was at home. She went out to greet him, offered tea and cigarettes, and treated him cordially. After a while, the man surnamed Li said, "Since Mr. Ni is not at home, I will not stay long, please give him my regards," and then left. Soon after, Ni returned, and Gendi told him that a guest surnamed Li had visited and left two boxes of gifts. Ni thought for a long time and had no friends surnamed Li, which was very strange. After opening the two original gift boxes, one contained a bottle of nitric acid and a pair of scissors, and the other contained a letter. Upon opening it, it was a threatening letter, demanding a large sum of money from Ni and instructing him to meet at the gate of Great China University on the afternoon of the 25th to negotiate payment, otherwise there would be unfavorable consequences. Ni immediately took the "gifts" to the Changning Road Police Station to report the incident. The Second Division sent officers to go to the address with Ni on time. They waited for a long time in front of the school gate, but nothing was gained, and the investigation is still in progress.</p>
<h3>The Judicial Yuan Has a Unified Interpretation of the Issue of Paying Deed Tax During the Occupation; The Method of Assessing Standard Prices Should Be Abolished</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] During the occupation period in this city, the sale and purchase of real estate was all calculated in puppet currency under the control of the enemy puppets. After the victory, the issue of how to pay the deed tax has not been resolved. The Finance Bureau received a unified interpretation from the Judicial Yuan through the Ministry of Finance regarding the payment of puppet currency debts in the occupied areas: "For debts originally paid in puppet currency by the parties in the occupied areas, after the government stipulates the ratio of puppet currency to legal tender, the legal tender should be used to repay them according to this ratio, but it does not hinder the application of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Litigation after Restoration." Regarding deed tax, it should be handled in accordance with these regulations, and the previous regulations on assessing standard prices should be abolished. After receiving the telegram, the Finance Bureau has sent a document to the Land Administration Bureau to comply with it from now on.</p>

<h3>Huang Pang is Unhappy After Seeking Pleasure; Gathers a Crowd to Cause Trouble at a Brothel</h3>
<p>The Qianmeng Brothel on the upper floor of No. 9 Qunyu Lane, Shantou Road, was formerly the Qianmeng Guide Agency.

However, Huang Pang expressed dissatisfaction, threw the 30,000 yuan in cash on the account table, and left with his friends. After a while, he telephoned ** the younger sister to the Old Oriental Hotel.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Allocates Saigon Rice to Suppress Fluctuations in Post-New Year Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Rice Merchants to Discuss Procedures</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year holiday is over, and all markets have resumed trading today. Regarding food, although rice shops opened yesterday, prices remained uncertain as the market had not yet opened. Concerned about price fluctuations after the holiday, the authorities prepared in advance to allocate Saigon rice under their control at negotiated prices. On the afternoon of the 25th, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting with Hu Weigang, Chairman of the Rice Merchants' Association; Xu Songren and Cai Shengming, representatives of the South Market; and Yin Fuxiang and Hu Wenan, representatives of the North Market, to discuss the allocation of Saigon rice. Chief Clerk Ji Mingzhai presided over the meeting, discussing technical issues related to the allocation and procedures for payment and delivery. The allocation price was set at 63,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight) for the market and 70,000 yuan per dan for retail sales. According to the Municipal Government, the rice reserves under its control are extremely abundant. In the event of price fluctuations today, the Municipal Government will immediately allocate Saigon rice to suppress the price, so it is expected that rice prices will not fluctuate significantly.</p>

Yesterday, the spot price for White Sand Sugar was 134,000 to 135,000 yuan, with the difference from the previous low point being small.

<h3>Registration of Oil, Paper, and Rubber Imports Completed; Small-Scale Importers to be Eliminated</h3>
<p>The registration work of the Wheel Management Committee has gradually begun. Initially, merchants will be required to declare past import quantities, and banks will verify the accuracy of the figures to create reliable statistics. So far, statistics for oil, paper, and rubber have been completed. Efforts are being made to expedite the collection of statistics for American cotton. Once the statistics are completed, a committee meeting will be convened to determine quotas. However, it is reported that among the more than 4,000 applicants, over 1,000 may be eliminated due to their smaller business volumes. Applications from small businesses with a trade volume of less than US$1,000 in American cotton last year will not be considered. This will allow imports to be concentrated in a small number of large merchants and reduce unnecessary competition.</p>
<h3>New York Silver Prices Plunge Last Monday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 25th] Silver prices plummeted 5.25 cents per ounce last Monday (January 20th), the most severe drop since December 8, 1920. Silver prices also plunged 5.25 cents on that day due to a large company implementing price cuts to attract buyers. Historically, the highest record of a silver price plunge was 10.25 cents on June 7, 1920. Since silver prices began to decline last December, Kodak Company can save at least $3 million annually. At the same time, demands from silver merchants to abolish the 50% silver transaction profit tax have become increasingly vocal. Consumers in the East have also complained about the U.S. Treasury Department's law to buy domestic silver at a price of 90.5 cents per ounce. Silverware manufacturers expect silver production in 1947 to more than double the record in 1941, but even this amount will not be able to meet wartime orders.</p>

<h3>Opening Prices for Coal, Firewood, and Charcoal Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>In the coal market, opening prices for various types of bituminous coal have risen across the board. In terms of transactions, only small urgent needs have seen some trading, while the rest are temporarily observing the market. White coal from Jiaozuo is scarce, and demand is weak, so there has been no formal trading. Only Hongji lump coal is selling well due to the extreme cold weather, and various shops are actively purchasing it. Transactions are quite lively, with prices not differing much from the previous market. The opening prices for firewood and charcoal have been publicly discussed by the New Charcoal Merchants' Association of this city, but actual transactions are limited due to unfavorable winds affecting transportation from the producing areas. Therefore, large-scale transactions are rare. The opening prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Gold Prices in Beiping Soar; Gold Shops Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Financial circles here report that the sharp rise in gold prices in Beiping has caused significant losses for many gold shops. Eleven gold shop managers fled before the Lunar New Year. The unofficial market price today, the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, is 560,000 yuan, and it is generally believed that it will rise to 660,000 yuan after the market opens. Insiders say that there are three reasons for this sharp rise, which far exceeds the prices in Shanghai: first, large amounts of gold bond certificates; second, the plane crash and the suspension of flights to Shanghai; and third, a certain party purchased 400 bars of gold at once in Beiping. Due to the soaring gold prices and the expansion of the war, peace talks are faltering, and general commodity prices have also been greatly affected. On average, prices have risen by 60% to 100% compared to two weeks ago, with cloth seeing the largest price increases.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Strives to Restore the Cotton Textile Industry</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 26th] Hong Kong hopes to quickly restore its important position in supplying cotton products to overseas markets. Cotton textiles were Hong Kong's largest industry before the war.</p>
<p>The immediate result will be the employment of a large number of unemployed workers in cotton textile factories. Before the war, the cotton textile industry employed 70,000 workers, with an additional 50,000 engaged in supporting work.</p>
<p>Before the war, Hong Kong consumed 20,000 tons of cotton yarn annually to manufacture bedsheets, socks, sportswear, underwear, and more.</p>
<p>Countries that purchased cotton products from Hong Kong included Malaya, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, South Africa, British West Indies, French Vietnam, China, East Africa and West Africa, the Philippines, Borneo, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Salt Remains the Main Commodity in This Year's Barter Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>It is understood that salt will still be the main commodity in this year's barter trade with Japan. Imported goods will primarily be industrial and mining equipment. The method for purchasing salt this year is currently being discussed by the China Trust Bureau and the Salt Administration Bureau.</p>
<h3>Developing Overseas Markets for Silk Products: Silk Export Guidance Association Established; United Company to Manufacture Silk Fabrics for Export to the UK and Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Due to the low international prices of raw silk, which are insufficient to cover costs, exports of our raw silk have been halted for a long time, and our silk industry is in a state of great distress. In order to alleviate the difficulties of our raw silk and silk weaving industries, national financial institutions, initiated by the Central Bank, invited four organizations, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Trust Bureau, and the China Silk Corporation, to form the Shanghai Silk Export Guidance Association to find a suitable way out for the raw silk and silk weaving industries. The Association was formally established the other day, with Lin Fengbao, Director of the Central Bank, serving as the chairman and Wang Zijian, Deputy Chairman of the China Trust Bureau's Sales Association, serving as the vice-chairman. It is understood that the Association's main task is to process raw silk into silk fabrics and then export them to earn foreign exchange to offset import surpluses. The importance of its mission is self-evident. For the sake of convenience, the Association has also established a Business Management Office to be responsible for implementing all the tasks set within the Association. Wang Xingsu, Deputy Director of the Business Department of the China Silk Corporation, has been appointed as the director of the office and has actively started work. It has been decided to supply the raw silk and rayon purchased and stored by the China Trust Bureau to the silk weaving industry in stages for weaving various silk fabrics. In the first phase, 1,400 dan of factory silk and 2,400 boxes of rayon will be provided. The organizational structure of the Chinese silk weaving industry will be coordinated. After many consultations with the silk weaving industry, the Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Production and Marketing Joint Company was organized and signed a weaving contract with the Association. The Export Guidance Association will provide wages, and finished products that pass inspection will be processed once every Wednesday, with a monthly interest rate of 3%. It is understood that there are more than 5,000 silk weaving machines in this city. It has now been decided to use 2,500 machines for export weaving. The raw materials supplied in the first phase can be woven into 80,000 pieces of silk fabric, with more than ten varieties. After the finished products are made, they will be shipped by the Association to the UK, France, India, and Southeast Asia for sale, which is more cost-effective than exporting raw silk. Our endangered silk and silk weaving industries are all encouraged by this measure.</p>

<p>Netherlands Offers Free Tuition; Decision to be Made Within Four Months</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Air News] The Ministry of Education previously decided to recruit 1,200 self-funded students to study abroad.

In addition to issuing a statement a few days ago, it has also decided to petition the Municipal Education Bureau and the three organizations of the Municipal Council this morning.

<h3>Basketball League New Year's First Battle: Quanhei Soundly Defeated by Juren; Green Forest Overcomes V Team in Overtime; Green Team Easily Defeats Qianghua in Women's Group</h3>
<p>The second Basketball League continued yesterday from 5:30 PM with three men's and women's matches at the City Gymnasium court. Due to the cold weather, the audience was not crowded. The results of the matches were as follows: the Green Team defeated Qianghua 45-16, the Green Forest and V teams from Group B of the Men's Division tied, with Green Forest narrowly winning in overtime, and the disorganized Quanhei team from Group A of the Men's Division was soundly defeated by Juren 46-14. Details of each match are described below:</p>
<p>Green Team Women's Overwhelming Victory Over Qianghua</p>
<p>The first match featured the women's teams Green and Qianghua. After the start, Green's Huang Mingyuan scored two consecutive shots, taking a 4-0 lead. Soon after, Green's Wang Weizhen committed a foul, and Qianghua's Cao Manli scored a free throw. Huang Mingyuan scored under the basket, and Qianghua's Wang Jun scored a long shot, bringing the score to 8-3 in favor of Green. Qianghua made a spirited effort, with Cao Manli and Wang Jun each scoring two free throws, closing the gap to 5-8. However, the Green team was superior, and at the end of the first quarter, they led 14-5. In the second quarter, Green's Huang Mingyuan scored first, Qianghua's Cao Manli scored a free throw, Green's Liu Baozhen added to the score, and Huang Mingyuan scored repeatedly, increasing the score dramatically. Qianghua called a timeout, but it was ineffective. At the end of the first half, Green had a significant advantage at 30-7. After switching sides, shortly after the start, Green's Wu Meiyi fouled out, and Xu Renbao replaced her. Qianghua showed some improvement, but Green's defense was solid, and their forwards, including Huang Mingyuan, were unstoppable. In the third quarter, Qianghua trailed 11-36. In the last quarter, after Qianghua's Cao Manli made a reverse layup under the basket, the Green team intensified their offense, making the score 40-13. Qianghua's Cao Manli scored a long shot, showing some activity, but Green tightened their defense, making it difficult for Qianghua to develop their game. As the final buzzer sounded, the Green team won 45-16.</p>

<h3>The Growing China New Academy: An Ideal School of Journalism</h3>
<p>— Shengjie</p>
<p>Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, said, "To save the peace of Europe, we must hang a dozen journalists." Kaiser Wilhelm II also said, "Though I have a million soldiers, I lack a single Times." From these two sentences, we can understand the power and importance of journalism. However, the history of journalism is only about thirty years old. The world-renowned Missouri School of Journalism was founded in 1908, and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism held its groundbreaking ceremony in 1913. Therefore, journalism is still a very young science. Speaking of journalism education in our country, it is lamentable that, apart from Yanjing and Fudan, almost no school has established a journalism department. Recently, National Central University (Zhengda) has also formally added a journalism department. However, relying on the graduates of these two or three university journalism departments is simply not enough to meet the future development and promotion of journalism. At the same time, eight years of bloody experience tells us that every major and minor battle's news reports rely on journalists, and these talents cannot be cultivated hastily during wartime. Today, we have won victory and are embarking on the road to national reconstruction. Due to past lessons and present needs, China must have a large school of journalism to train journalistic cadres. But the reality is not ideal; the difficulty of material conditions, the lack of talent, the backwardness of education... and other objective environmental constraints! As we waited and waited in disappointment, a faint glimmer of dawn suddenly appeared in the dark corner. A newly established school of journalism was born with the needs of this new era. That is the China New Academy of Journalism that is growing today.</p>
<p>President Chen Gaoyong, formerly a professor at Fudan University and one of China's top ten famous professors, with the forthright spirit of a northerner, united some friends in the journalism community and gained the support of people in the education and cultural circles, arduously supporting a heavy burden, determined to establish an ideal school of journalism in China.</p>
<p>The "New Academy" professors are all famous reporters in Shanghai. Zhu Xubai, director of the Municipal Government Information Office, teaches Reporting; Qian Nashui, chief editor of the Frontline Daily, teaches Editing; Lu Mang, deputy director of the Information Office of the Third Front Army, teaches Current Affairs Analysis; Cheng Zhongwen, director of the Shanghai office of the Wuhan Daily, teaches Editorial Writing; Zhang Yaoxiang, director of the Education Department of Jinan University, teaches Social Psychology; Sun Guiding, professor at Jinan University, teaches English Translation; Wang Qixi, deputy editor of Shen Bao, and Bu Shaofu and Chu Yukun, columnists, share the responsibility of teaching Reporting, Periodical Editing, and Introduction to Journalism. Other professors are also well-known figures in the domestic journalism community.</p>
<p>The school was founded with the victory of the War of Resistance, and it has been a year since then. Two sessions of the Research Department have concluded, with nearly four hundred graduates. Although not all of them are engaged in journalism, most of them are already working in newspapers. They are scattered in various large and small newspapers in the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian, serving as field reporters and editors in no less than a hundred people. There are also many others working in various news agencies. Although these newly graduated journalistic warriors are just greenhorns, their spirit, work ethic, and enthusiasm have indeed won the praise of their journalistic seniors. For example, Cai Yibiao, a graduate of the first class, is now a reporter for the Central News Agency. He was praised by Mr. Feng Youzhen for obtaining a piece of news and was immediately promoted from a trainee reporter to a full reporter. This may be due to his youth, but the influence of the school's basic education cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Currently, the school has a total of four classes: one upper-level class (divided into three groups: A, B, and C), one lower-level class, two upper-level classes, and three classes in total for the undergraduate program, and one class (divided into two groups: A and B) for the research program. The entire school has about four hundred students, with males accounting for four-fifths and females accounting for one-fifth. Undergraduate classes are held during the day, and research classes are held in the evening. The academic level of the students varies. Most of the undergraduate students are high school graduates, with a few having attended university or working and studying at two schools concurrently. The research students are all sophomores or graduates of universities. Many are already working in various fields, mostly reporters and editors from various newspapers, followed by doctors, lawyers, middle school teachers, actors, and demobilized youth soldiers. Outsiders who hear about their diverse backgrounds may feel that the quality is uneven and that it affects the school's atmosphere. In fact, a person engaged in journalism should know everything and encompass everything. Having so many different types of people together is a good opportunity to connect with people from all walks of life in future work. This is also what distinguishes it from other schools.</p>
<p>The youngest student is only sixteen years old, and the oldest is no more than thirty years old. Judging from their age, these students are still young. Therefore, in addition to attending classes, they are very active in their spare time, such as putting up wall newspapers, performing plays, and organizing sports teams. At the same time, in order to encourage students to increase their interest in academic research, the school has also held English and Chinese speech contests and literary competitions. The students in each class competed to be the first to participate, eager to determine who would win. Their lively and innocent expressions symbolize optimism about the future development of China's journalism.</p>
<p>In addition to regular courses, they also have extracurricular assignments, such as literary exercises, special interviews, Chinese-English translation, and current affairs commentaries. These supplement the deficiencies of the regular courses. In addition, there is a small library. Although the scale is not large, it is enough for students to regularly use as spiritual food and reference materials. Whenever the end-of-class bell rings or the start-of-class bell has not yet rung, they swarm there, all with a sense of fear, desperately seizing time, fearing to waste those five or ten minutes.</p>
<p>Their school building, it's funny to say, is not as big as the area of ​​a large ballroom or cinema. In just this small place, you would never imagine that there would be hundreds of young men and women studying diligently.</p>
<p>In the quiet and secluded southern section of Avenue Albert, on a smooth asphalt road, opposite the Yiyuan, a sacred place for musical performances in Shanghai, in the southeast corner of the Chinese-French Pharmaceutical College campus, in a ochre, semi-Western-style bungalow, we must not ignore the fact that a large group of future news warriors are growing there. They are the pioneers who will inherit and develop the new Chinese journalism.</p>

<h3>Ten Major Uses of Budget Statements</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>At the start of each year, budget formulation can be said to be quantitatively important work because a carefully prepared budget statement has the following benefits:</p>
<p>(1) It can make the use of working capital most economical, that is, to generate the greatest work efficiency with the most economical working capital.</p>
<p>(2) Because it is jointly drafted by the heads of each department, unnecessary losses and waste can be avoided.</p>
<p>(3) The responsibilities of each part are clear. For example, if the manufacturing cost in the budget statement is a certain amount, and the actual manufacturing exceeds the budget, the reason can be investigated.</p>
<p>(4) A detailed budget statement can enable each department to cooperate closely.</p>
<p>(5) Each point listed in a budget statement can be clear to the heads of departments at a glance. Any overuse of funds in a certain department can be detected immediately.</p>
<p>(6) With a budget, it can be compared with the final accounts, which can also show how visionary the head of the department is.</p>
<p>(7) Budget statements can help heads of departments assess whether sales, manufacturing, and economic scheduling policies are reasonable.</p>
<p>(8) A head of department with a budget must constantly check market conditions, so he can plan necessary expansions in various undertakings.</p>
<p>(9) With a budget statement, heads of departments must strive to save on raw materials, labor, and other expenses in order to meet the budget.</p>
<p>(10) With a budget statement, there can be a basis for implementing it in future years. According to the current situation, because the situation is constantly changing, the budget period should not be too long and can be set for three or six months.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow's Producers: Automated Factories</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Xiang</p>
<p>Imagine a clean and spacious factory, with no one working on the floor, only nine technicians pacing on the upper platform, paying attention to the control machines. Raw materials are transported in by conveyor, and after passing through a series of machines, finished and packaged products are released: radios, refrigerators, fountain pens, tractors, or anything else you want to produce.</p>
<p>This factory of tomorrow differs from today's factories as much as a hydroelectric plant differs from an old-fashioned steam power plant using a row of boilers and people adding coal.</p>
<p>In modern times, people are less useful on the factory floor than anywhere else. We already have machines that see more clearly than the eye, calculate more reliably than the brain, record more accurately than memory, and work faster and better than hands. These devices never feel hungry or tired. They can do anything a worker can do, and do it quickly, well, and continuously.</p>
<p>Wartime Labor Shortages Spawned This System</p>
<p>The wartime "continuous-flow system" made the production of chemicals, kerosene, rubber, and atomic bomb materials completely automatic.</p>
<p>A completely automated factory needs three basic representations of mechanical units: these all exist today. First, there must be devices for sending and receiving announcements. We already have many of these. For example, we use photoelectric cells for proofreading; microphones and vibration meters find pressure differences; and there are electronic tube computers with almost unbelievable computational precision.</p>
<p>The second type of basic mechanical unit is an electronic device that can accept announcements and transmit them one by one to control the machinery for correctly manufacturing items. This equipment is now widely used.</p>
<p>The third type of basic mechanical unit is responsible for the real manufacturing work. Their applications are extensive, taking on the work of cutting, shaping, assembling, and painting artificial objects.</p>
<p>In many cases, industry uses automated machines for various specialized tasks. The author suggests linking some of these machines together into a group to produce and coordinate a complete product. This complete production machine will be extremely useful, and its components can be easily rearranged to create a completely different effect.</p>
<p>Robots Engage in Production</p>
<p>For more diverse applications of automated production, we recommend what we call "arm machines". Basically, it is composed of an articulated arm embedded in a turntable. The free end is equipped with a specially gripped fixture: a gripping pawl, vise, or magnet, depending on the nature of the work. At the bottom, the mechanical structure allows the arm to rotate and bend on the pivot and move the holding fixture. This machine can move like a worker's arm, and the hand itself can rotate at the wrist. Its model has already been made.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to make a part, say a copper ring with internal threads to hold the microphone of a telephone receiver. The work procedure is recorded on a perforated roll of paper, using the holes on the paper to communicate to the "working machine": raw copper tubing must be made into copper rings. A communication unit translates the meaning expressed by the paper holes into electrical impulses, which are transmitted to the "arm" and "manufacturing machine". During the manufacturing process, the paper holes can direct the change of tools on the holding fixture. The made copper rings pass through an inspection machine on a conveyor belt, and any defects are discarded, otherwise, they are conveyed out.</p>
<p>An automated factory is composed of many production mechanical units. As described earlier, each unit forms a simple part, which is combined by a central control panel.</p>
<p>An organization that fully utilizes this type of automated machinery will be very different from the present and will create a new industrial order. Producing twenty-four hours a day, the factory will provide large quantities of cheap goods. The quality of the goods will also be better because the machines work more precisely during manufacturing.</p>
<p>The alterability of the basic mechanical units makes the manufacturer unafraid of sudden changes in the market. If different kinds of products are to be manufactured, there are instructions on the control machine, and the technician can rearrange the production units and then the continuous work can begin again.</p>
<p>This alterability speeds up the introduction of new products. In today's factories, to implement new plans, manufacturers must dismantle most of their machinery, which is extremely uneconomical in terms of time and money.</p>
<p>A New Industrial Revolution Will Enrich the Common People</p>
<p>During the war, industry created more fundamental new products in three years than in the past thirty years. Unless we establish a system of mechanical production suitable for change, we cannot quickly obtain truly new cars, trains, refrigerators, and houses.</p>
<p>Automated factories may cause temporary waves of unemployment. But the huge benefits are unparalleled. Managing machines is always better than managing people. In the end, this new machinery only has value with mass employment and a mass market. The development of automated production requires highly skilled technicians and managers. Using training programs, shorter work cycles, and other strategies can stabilize the transitional shock.</p>
<p>The latent awareness of the automated production system makes the ideal of working two or three days a week achievable. Its low cost can give workers higher wages and also have greater value for consumers. Therefore, the standard of living for human beings must be higher than it is now. The new machines can forever liberate workers from tedious, monotonous labor.</p>

<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>(IV) After Employment</p>
<p>After employing workers, an enterprise organization ultimately hopes they can work with peace of mind and obtain opportunities for advancement. Therefore, several things should be noted. The first point is attendance. The personnel department should maintain attendance records. Factories commonly use wooden plaques, collecting the plaques when workers start and hanging them up, or use a sign-in method. The most advanced method is using a time clock. Every worker must punch in and out on a card at the start and end of work. Before the end of the month, these are submitted to the personnel department to check for lateness or early departures. Within the personnel department, it is best to have a form for each employee, with the following format: Number, Name, Date, 1 2 3 4 5, January, February, March, Total Working Days, Days Absent, Percentage of Attendance.</p>
<p>In the squares, any instances of lateness, early departure, or leave should be marked in red. For example, AS represents sick leave, AN represents unexcused absence, ES represents early departure due to illness, EN represents unexcused early departure, etc. Because every employee should submit a leave application form when taking leave, have it signed by the work department, and then forward it to the personnel department for recording. Generally, enterprise organizations have rules stipulating that those who have not taken any leave during the year receive a corresponding reward, such as a one-month salary bonus. There are also disciplinary regulations, such as deducting salary, for those with excessive absences. The second point to consider is salary and living conditions. From the perspective of the enterprise organization, of course, they hope to employ workers at the lowest cost because low wages mean lower expenses and lighter costs. However, they should also consider the workers' needs. They cannot disregard the standard of living in order to save expenses. Therefore, when the standard of living rises, salaries should be automatically increased to allow workers to work with peace of mind. It is also very important to ensure that employees work for a long time after they are initially hired. Many enterprise organizations stipulate that employees who have worked for ten years receive a certain bonus, and those who have worked for twenty-five years receive a certain bonus.</p>
<p>The third point to consider is the issue of promotions and transfers. Everyone has a desire to move up. No one wants to do low-level work forever. Therefore, when an employee is diligent or has made special contributions, they should be given monetary or grade-level rewards. When promoting or transferring employees, this will affect the records kept by the personnel department. Therefore, the responsible work department should send a notification form to the personnel department so that the personnel department can make changes to the records.</p>

<h3>四川的山　　桐窗雜憶之一</h3>
<p>The Mountains of Sichuan – Miscellaneous Memories from Tongchuang, Part 1</p>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>常聽人說，「桂林山水甲天下」，我一直憧憬着廣西的山水，但直到現在沒有能夠去遊歷。有些朋友說，桂林山水這奇特，不過都是平地上聳立起來的石筍，形狀突元，所以出奇，如果當作畫面似的風景看，就乏味了。我是特別喜歡風景的一個人，所以，我前常喜歡「野外寫生」，近來常畫中國畫，也喜作山水。曾經，小時候看過許多山水古畫，使我悠然神往，想住在叢山峻嶺之中，聽着松壽，望着流水，是多麽幽靜的生活。這當然是一種想像，但我却從不懷疑，畫面上那樣的山水，並非眞實境界。這次，從西北到四川來，在路上，看見那些山水，格外相信，那些前人的名作，並非虛構了。誰說中國畫歷現實太遠呢？限於一條長條子的格式，而在那上面構出畫來，中國山水畫有這一種特長。四川這一帶的山水，最宜乎這樣的佈局。這可以證明中國從前的畫家，大都取材於自然界，並非依據成法，在紙上捏造天地，而一個畫家的遊歷名山大川，是最必要的修養。寫史記的司馬遷，幾乎遊遍了漢朝中國的本部，所以他的文章浩肆旁礴，為古文的宗師，那末，畫家中的關仝，馬遠之輩，又何嘗不是履行家。實在，四川這一帶的山，太使我戀戀不捨了，長松，翠柏，高峰，峻嶺，叢巒，壘崗，亂石，怪樹，瀑布，靑溪，白雲，朝霧，竹林，村舍，急流，狂喘，幽禽，野鳥，充塞在這一帶的山間，人在這裏而走，「如行在圖畫之中」，眞有這種情形。</p>
<p>I often hear people say, "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world." I have always longed to visit the scenery of Guangxi, but I have not been able to travel there until now. Some friends say that the peculiarity of Guilin's scenery is that it is just stone bamboo shoots rising from the ground, with abrupt shapes, so it is surprising. If you look at it as a picture-like landscape, it is dull. I am a person who especially likes scenery. Therefore, I used to often like "plein air sketching," and recently I often paint Chinese paintings, and also like to create landscapes. I once saw many ancient landscape paintings when I was a child, which made me yearn for them. I wanted to live in the midst of mountains and ridges, listening to the pines and watching the flowing water, what a quiet life. This is of course an imagination, but I never doubted that the landscape in the paintings was not a real realm. This time, coming to Sichuan from the Northwest, on the road, seeing those landscapes, I especially believed that those famous works of the predecessors were not fictional. Who says that Chinese painting is too far from reality? Limited to the format of a long strip, and constructing a painting on it, Chinese landscape painting has this kind of special skill. The landscape of Sichuan is most suitable for such a layout. This proves that ancient Chinese painters mostly drew materials from nature, rather than creating the world on paper based on established methods. A painter's travel to famous mountains and rivers is the most necessary cultivation. Sima Qian, who wrote the Historical Records, almost traveled all over the mainland of the Han Dynasty, so his articles were vast and majestic, and he was the master of ancient prose. Then, the painters Guan Tong and Ma Yuan were not practitioners either. Indeed, the mountains in Sichuan make me so reluctant to leave. Tall pines, green cypresses, high peaks, steep ridges, clusters of peaks, stacked hills, chaotic rocks, strange trees, waterfalls, green streams, white clouds, morning mist, bamboo forests, villages, rushing streams, violent gasps, secluded birds, wild birds, fill the mountains in this area. Walking here, "as if walking in a picture," this is really the case.</p>
<p>我做夢也沒有想到四川來，感悟日本人，把我從西北逼到這裏，看到這許多山水，是我莫大的收穫，我沒有到過四川的全部，相信，在我走過的地區外，還有更好的山水，從地圖上看起來，中國的山脈，原來擠在西南這一帶。世界上山脈的聚結處，也在歐亞交界的地方。當初地球發冷的時候，特別在這一帶凝結起許多皺紋和　瘤，成了我們愛看的許多風景，而中國的版圖，也切到了這幽靜的一部，使我在本國的土地上，尋覓出許多畫材，這實在是一種幸福。</p>
<p>I never dreamed of coming to Sichuan. I am grateful to the Japanese for forcing me from the Northwest to here. Seeing so much scenery is my greatest gain. I have not been to all of Sichuan. I believe that there is better scenery outside the areas I have traveled. Looking at the map, China's mountains are originally crowded in the southwest. The gathering place of the world's mountains is also at the junction of Europe and Asia. When the earth cooled down in the beginning, many wrinkles and tumors condensed in this area, becoming many landscapes that we love to see, and the Chinese territory also cut to this quiet part, allowing me to find many painting materials in my own country, which is really a kind of happiness.</p>

<p>The sound of gunfire has been silent for several days.</p>
<p>火綫像是轉移到別的地方去，然而，火綱內的駱家村還是只有駱老頭自己。這是一位硬朗而又倔強的老漢，他十八歲時因為和家裏淘氣，在軍隊裏一混便是十幾年，他的足跡踏遍了西北與江南。張勳復辟一役，左手掛了彩，他回家來了。他改穿舊衣，重新荷起農具，安份的度着傳統的耕者生活。每在秋收無事，天寒夜長時，他格外受村鄰的愛戴；那間牛屋—他的臥房，中間有一團熊熊的火光，周圍擠滿了靑年人，孩子們，靜靜的，在辟拍的火聲中，傾聽他述說十幾年離奇古怪的遭逢。</p>
<p>The front line seems to have shifted to another place, but in Luojia Village within the fire zone, there is still only old man Luo himself. This is a tough and stubborn old man. When he was eighteen years old, he was naughty with his family, and he spent more than ten years in the army, his footprints all over the Northwest and Jiangnan. In the Zhang Xun restoration campaign, his left hand was injured, and he returned home. He changed into old clothes, picked up farming tools again, and lived a traditional farming life in peace. Every time after the autumn harvest, when there was nothing to do, when the weather was cold and the nights were long, he was especially loved by his neighbors; in that cowshed—his bedroom—there was a blazing fire in the middle, surrounded by young people and children, quietly listening to him tell about his bizarre experiences over the past ten years amidst the crackling sound of the fire.</p>
<p>「看吧，我們終歸會勝的。」</p>
<p>"Look, we will eventually win."</p>
<p>憑他的經騐他有充分的自信力，他的話總是肯定的。勝利果然到臨了，他買些香燭紙砲，敬天地，拜祖先，欣歡欲狂。但，半年後駱家村又打起仗來，這是他想像不到的！他大兒子當兵至今未回家，小兒子又給編組了去。駱家村在火綱內，什麼全給打得稀爛；山上駐了兵，無法進去，祇得呌老伴帶着媳婦孫兒到沒戰爭的地方去人。那老嫗經不起風霜饑餓，一月之後便死在路上。駱老頭得到這消息，他鬆下口裏的旱烟袋，垂着頭，輕輕太息一下：</p>
<p>Based on his experience, he had full confidence, and his words were always affirmative. Victory did come, and he bought some incense candles and paper firecrackers, respected the heavens and the earth, worshipped his ancestors, and was overjoyed. But, half a year later, Luojia Village started fighting again, which he couldn't imagine! His eldest son had been in the army and had not returned home, and his youngest son had been enlisted again. Luojia Village was in the fire zone, and everything was completely destroyed; soldiers were stationed on the mountain, so they couldn't go in, so they had to tell the old wife to take the daughter-in-law and grandchildren to a place where there was no war. The old woman couldn't stand the wind, frost, hunger, and starvation, and died on the road a month later. When old man Luo got the news, he loosened the dry tobacco pouch in his mouth, lowered his head, and sighed softly:</p>
<p>「世道變了！」</p>
<p>"The world has changed!"</p>
<p>中然心酸一陣，但他並不失望，他想：六十年一個甲子，變亂總有平復的時候。他活着依然很在勁兒。這村上固然只剩他一個人，他還是勤勤快快的過日子，他們可憐的幾畝地，都用手播種上小麥，已是綠油油的一片。其餘的—那廣大的地面全荒廢着迪倒使他感到無限的心傷。</p>
<p>He was saddened for a while, but he was not disappointed. He thought: sixty years is a cycle, and the chaos will always be calmed down. He is still very energetic in his life. Although he is the only one left in this village, he still lives diligently, and their poor few acres of land are all sown with wheat by hand, and it is already a green field. The rest—the vast area is completely deserted, which makes him feel infinitely heartbroken.</p>
<p>「唏！」</p>
<p>"Hee!"</p>
<p>他噓了一聲，旱烟袋又塞進嘴裏。</p>
<p>He hissed, and the dry tobacco pouch was stuffed back into his mouth.</p>
<p>這天陽光很好，風沙小，室外不大冷，駱老頭像平素的晴天一樣，安閒的坐在門外石滾上取　。經騐告訴他，今天正是大年初一，他立刻站起來，將他噓了一聲，旱烟袋堅在石滾旁，握起破掃帶，把兩間歪斜的屋子掃得乾乾淨淨，又掃了一掃院子；洗過手臉，對着房內後牆上那張陳舊的「駱氏三代之神位」的葒紙簽恭敬的磕了三個頭，然後拍拍膝前的灰　，出了門，提着旱烟袋，蹲在門檻抽起來。</p>
<p>The sun was very good that day, the wind and sand were small, and it was not very cold outside. Old man Luo, like on a normal sunny day, sat leisurely on the stone roller outside the door to get warm. Experience told him that today was the first day of the lunar new year, and he immediately stood up, hissed, placed the dry tobacco pouch next to the stone roller, grabbed the broken broom, swept the two crooked houses clean, and swept the yard again; washed his hands and face, and respectfully kowtowed three times to the old red paper sign of "The Spiritual Tablet of the Luo Family's Three Generations" on the back wall of the room, then patted the dust in front of his knees, went out the door, carried the dry tobacco pouch, and squatted on the threshold to smoke.</p>
<p>「我也算過了年了。」他自言自語着。</p>
<p>"I have also celebrated the new year." He said to himself.</p>
<p>抽着烟，駱老頭展眼向郊外瞭望着，從村莊到村莊，房子，祇剩下一些傾圮的帶烟熏的山牆；樹木焦爛的立在地上，沒有人畜，聽不到犬吠鷄鳴，看不見一縷炊烟，無邊的灰黃色，極目蒼閔！轉眼看看駱家村，一樣的，什麼也沒有：他的屋子還是三個月前自己用樹枝亂草搭起來的。往年鬼子橫行時，兵一退大家全搬了回來，理墻蓋屋怪有心勁，現在呢，人一去更不回來了！這裏簡直成了荒草湖坡。他不懂這是什麼意思？為什麼破壞得比敵人佔領期間還厲害！人逃光了，地荒着，大家都沒有糧食喫！…………</p>
<p>Smoking, old man Luo looked out at the countryside, from village to village, the houses, only some dilapidated gables with smoke stains remained; the trees stood charred on the ground, there were no people or animals, he couldn't hear dogs barking or chickens crowing, he couldn't see a wisp of smoke, the boundless gray-yellow color was desolate! Looking back at Luojia Village, it was the same, nothing was there: his house was still built by himself three months ago with branches and weeds. In the past, when the Japanese devils were rampant, everyone moved back as soon as the soldiers withdrew, and they were strangely motivated to repair the walls and build the houses. Now, people have left and never come back! This place has simply become a deserted grassy lake slope. He didn't understand what this meant? Why was the destruction more severe than during the enemy's occupation! People have all fled, the land is barren, and everyone has no food to eat! …………</p>
<p>「我不懂！」</p>
<p>"I don't understand!"</p>
<p>從前鬼子呌他們修路，每回全村最多去上三二十人，敷衍敷衍。等到晚上，國軍破路的命令到達，沒老沒少，不分男女，扛起傢伙一窩蜂樣的全湧去扒路，天剛亮，大夥又一起喜皮笑臉的跑回家。這會兒世道變了，人都給攪擾得逃光了！……反正他十年八年不會死，到底怎麼一回事他還可以看得見。他希望着，希望總有一天駱家村能夠恢復原狀。</p>
<p>In the past, when the Japanese devils told them to repair the road, at most thirty or twenty people from the whole village went to do it each time, just going through the motions. When the order from the national army to destroy the road arrived in the evening, young and old, regardless of men and women, carried their tools and rushed to dig up the road like a swarm of bees. At dawn, everyone ran home together with happy faces. Now the world has changed, and everyone has been disturbed and fled! … Anyway, he won't die in ten or eight years, and he can still see what's going on. He hoped, hoping that one day Luojia Village could return to its original state.</p>
<p>遠遠的，有一個藍色的人影移動着，駱老頭吃力的望着，他不大信任自已的眼睛，這地方會有誰來？待走近時，他看到那個穿着不相稱的藍棉袍的是他的大兒子，背着一個包袱，老遠的就喊：</p>
<p>In the distance, there was a blue figure moving. Old man Luo strained his eyes to look. He didn't quite trust his own eyes. Who would come to this place? When he got closer, he saw that the person wearing an ill-fitting blue cotton robe was his eldest son, carrying a bundle on his back, shouting from a distance:</p>
<p>「爸爸，爸爸！」</p>
<p>"Dad, Dad!"</p>
<p>老人輕輕的答應一聲，對於兒子的歸來，他並不感十分興趣；他希望的是全村親鄰都能回來。一見面兒子便問道：</p>
<p>The old man responded softly. He was not very interested in his son's return; he hoped that all the relatives and neighbors in the village could return. As soon as they met, the son asked:</p>
<p>「他們呢？」</p>
<p>"Where are they?"</p>
<p>「回頭再說。」</p>
<p>"We'll talk about it later."</p>
<p>兒子取出包裹裏的麵粉，豬肉和一瓶高梁酒，放在門後；父子兩人開始談起來，駱老頭先說到兒子離家後村上的情形。接着，大兒子說他已經正式升了班長，因為離家近，連長特許回家看看。他父親問他目前為什麼還在打仗，他回簽不出所以然來。談了半晌，駱老頭沒得到一點自己希望的事物；他轉了話題，要求大兒陪他做飯。</p>
<p>The son took out the flour, pork, and a bottle of sorghum wine from the package and placed them behind the door; the father and son began to talk. Old man Luo first talked about the situation in the village after his son left home. Then, the eldest son said that he had been officially promoted to squad leader, and because he was close to home, the company commander allowed him to come home to see. His father asked him why they were still fighting now, and he couldn't answer the reason. After talking for a long time, old man Luo didn't get any of the things he hoped for; he changed the subject and asked his eldest son to accompany him to cook.</p>
<p>飯剛做好，小兒子也化了裝加到家。他帶了一些食鹽和兩條土造烟。父子三人坐在一起，吃着飯，他們唱完那一瓶高梁酒，小兒子如同對部下一般的，誇張的講着他們的日常生活，起初駱老頭聽得有趣味，及至小兒子一再重複說着，老人臉色漸漸現出一層厭煩，他不怏意的說：</p>
<p>The meal was just cooked when the youngest son also came home in disguise. He brought some salt and two homemade cigarettes. The father and three sons sat together, eating, they finished that bottle of sorghum wine, and the youngest son, as if to his subordinates, exaggeratedly talked about their daily life. At first, old man Luo listened with interest, but as the youngest son repeatedly said it, the old man's face gradually showed a layer of boredom, and he said unhappily:</p>
<p>「虧你生張好嘴巴！」</p>
<p>"What a glib tongue you have!"</p>
<p>「什麼？……」</p>
<p>"What? …"</p>
<p>小兒子想還嘴，但祇說一聲什麼便住口了。駱老頭看看兩個兒子的眼臉；想到被澈底破壞了的村莊，荒廢的土地，餐風宿露逃難在外的親鄰；想到兄弟二人在第一綫，一個娘生的，同是他的兒子，却互相殘殺，針鋒相對，他不禁有些感嘆了：</p>
<p>The youngest son wanted to retort, but only said something and stopped. Old man Luo looked at the faces of his two sons; thinking of the thoroughly destroyed village, the barren land, the relatives and neighbors who were eating and sleeping in the open air and fleeing; thinking of the two brothers on the front line, born of the same mother, both his sons, but killing each other, facing each other tit-for-tat, he couldn't help but sigh:</p>
<p>「好內銷們都回來了，咱們好好的過這個年，以後誰也不許再出門了！」</p>
<p>"Good internal consumers have all returned, let's have a good new year, and no one is allowed to go out again in the future!"</p>
<p>老人說着走出房門，他腦海裏閃過一個可喜的遐想。小兒子朝着老人的背影說：</p>
<p>The old man said as he walked out of the room, a gratifying reverie flashed in his mind. The youngest son said to the old man's back:</p>
<p>「老頑固！」</p>
<p>"Old stubborn!"</p>
<p>「拍」</p>
<p>"Slap"</p>
<p>大兒子有些看不過去，他忍不住，狠狠的在他弟弟的腦袋上扔一巴掌；那弟弟暴跳起來，指着他的哥哥：</p>
<p>The eldest son couldn't stand it anymore, he couldn't help but slap his younger brother hard on the head; the younger brother jumped up and pointed at his brother:</p>
<p>「奴才，你以為我不敢和你鬥爭嗎？」</p>
<p>"Lackey, do you think I don't dare to fight you?"</p>
<p>「混蛋！」</p>
<p>"Bastard!"</p>
<p>於是兄弟兩人扭成一團，邊打邊駡，駱老頭一脚踏進房門，摸摸鬍鬚，嚴厲的高聲嚷着：</p>
<p>So the two brothers twisted into a ball, fighting and scolding, old man Luo stepped into the door, stroked his beard, and shouted sternly:</p>
<p>「不要打，都跪下來！跪在祖先面前，平心靜氣想一想啊！……看看咱們的村莊，咱們的土地；想想咱們的親鄰吧！……再打，連自們這破陋的屋子也保不住了！……」</p>
<p>"Don't fight, kneel down! Kneel in front of the ancestors, think calmly! … Look at our village, our land; think about our relatives and neighbors! … If you fight again, we won't even be able to keep this broken house! …"</p>
<h3>茅屋</h3>
<p>Thatched Cottage</p>
<p>— 華風</p>
<p>— Hua Feng</p>
<p>在這個荒涼的山谷裏，茅屋沉默地蹲在陡峭的山坡上，迎着太陽從峯頂昇起又落下，迎着每一個苦寒的風雨吹打的日子。</p>
<p>In this desolate valley, the thatched cottage silently squats on the steep hillside, facing the sun rising and falling from the peak, facing every day of bitter cold wind and rain.</p>
<p>當春天姍姍地從山外翻越過來時，給予茅屋以最大喜悅的該是那條淙淙地唱着歌　從它脚下穿過的溪流了。秧歌，收歌，布榖島的啼喚應和着溪流日夜的狂嘯，一串洪亮的靑春底蠱惑的天籟便蕩漾在山谷裏。</p>
<p>When spring slowly rolls over from outside the mountain, what should give the thatched cottage the greatest joy is the stream that sings and flows under its feet. The yangko song, the harvest song, and the cries of the cuckoo echo the stream's roaring day and night, and a string of loud, youthful, bewitching celestial music ripples in the valley.</p>
<p>是屬於遠祖的年代了，茅屋曾經過有一個光輝的蠍子那時它底主人擁有衆多的牲口，廣大的耕地，驚人的勞力和無數的農具，種籽，肥料………那時日子是熱鬧而忙碌的。</p>
<p>It belongs to the age of distant ancestors. The thatched cottage once had a glorious scorpion. At that time, its master had many livestock, vast cultivated land, amazing labor force, and countless farming tools, seeds, and fertilizers... At that time, life was lively and busy.</p>
<p>白天，它靜靜地躺在柔和的陽光下做着夢。晚上，當它底主人一個個從田野歸來時，它底寬暢的心上便洋溢着生命底歡呼。大家圍在一蓋森藍的油燈下檢討一天工作的成績，而牛犢們便在矮的茅棚低聲地澌炓着，山谷的夜雖然幽靜，但茅屋是不會感到寂寞的。</p>
<p>During the day, it quietly lies in the soft sunlight, dreaming. At night, when its masters return from the fields one by one, its spacious heart is filled with the cheers of life. Everyone gathers around a Gersaint blue oil lamp to review the results of the day's work, while the calves are quietly eating grass in the low shed. Although the night in the valley is quiet, the thatched cottage will not feel lonely.</p>
<p>現在，春耕的季節雖然來臨，而屋却沒有音日那樣餘款了。因為它知道自己底主人已失去了所有的牲口農具和種籽。………望着那一片荒蕪的耕地，它簌簌地滴下悒　的眼淚。</p>
<p>Now, although the spring plowing season has arrived, the house does not have as much balance as on the day of the sound. Because it knows that its master has lost all the livestock, farming tools, and seeds. … Looking at the desolate cultivated land, it dripped sad tears.</p>
<h3>白畫像</h3>
<p>Self-Portrait</p>
<p>— 方棣克</p>
<p>— Fang Dike</p>
<p>方棣克（Van　Dyck1590－1641）是魯班斯最得意的珍上門人。十九歲就享了盛名，英王Cha．les．L，奉師命辦去英王，漫遊意大利，埋頭研究古代人家；又五年，果大成。三十三歲再應英王聘，為宮廷畫師，賜建皇宮式之畫室於台姆司河畔，製作甚多，代表有「耶穌下葬」，「英王祁爾斯　一世騎馬像」，「聖百代樂受難」等。此為二十歲之自畫像，至今仍在，可謂難得。（獅）</p>
<p>Van Dyck (1590-1641) was Rubens' most proud and treasured disciple. He enjoyed great fame at the age of nineteen. King Charles I of England, ordered by his master, went to the English King, traveled in Italy, and immersed himself in the study of ancient people; after another five years, he achieved great success. At the age of thirty-three, he was again hired by the King of England as a court painter, and was granted a palace-style studio on the banks of the Thames River. He produced many works, including "The Entombment of Christ", "Equestrian Portrait of Charles I", "The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew", etc. This is a self-portrait at the age of twenty, which still exists today, which is very rare.

<h3>漫談舞獅</h3>
<p>A Casual Discussion on Lion Dance</p>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>每逢夏曆歲首，或是其他的紀念節期，廣東本地和粵僑所在的地方，多有「舞獅」的娛樂，舞獅固可以表示團結，又可以振刷精神，鼓樂的節奏有序，更令人們精神渙發。</p>
<p>Every Lunar New Year, or other commemorative festivals, in Guangdong and in places where Cantonese overseas Chinese reside, there is often the entertainment of "lion dance." Lion dance can express unity, can boost morale, and the rhythmic drum music is orderly, making people more energetic.</p>
<p>舞獅的起源，無書可徴，有說是圖騰的遺跡，也有說是太古落時期出搬獲得勝利品的表示，是否屬實，無可稽考了。舞獅的組織，是由各鄉的祠堂，或武館，街坊等而來。在上海呢，多屬武館，如由什麼社什麼堂做基礎的。獅頭的構造，是用竹片紮輪廓，用紙糊成，塗油彩色，裝毛嵌鏡，耳眼口舌，都能活動。獅身用彩綢製成，尾裝長毛．獅的鬚眉，多屬白色，表示老獅。若果黑鬚黑眉，便是壯年獅中，出外遊行，便常遭遇到好事的鬥爭。所以獅子的鬍眉多用白，就是這個原故。但是有些鄕村或武館，自恃人多勢大，軍器充足，而用黑色眉鬚的獅子，到處挑皺的也有，不過別的獅子聞着它的行跡，住往閃進，不敢正面相偶，恐怕招川死非來，因為以前舞獅的常常借故尋仇鬧事，有時因為舞獅而弄到械鬥，但是這些陋習，近年來減少了。</p>
<p>The origin of lion dance cannot be verified from books. Some say it is a relic of totemism, and some say it is a sign of obtaining victory products from primitive times. Whether it is true or not cannot be verified. The organization of lion dance comes from ancestral halls, martial arts halls, neighborhoods, etc. in various villages. In Shanghai, it mostly belongs to martial arts halls, such as those based on certain societies or halls. The structure of the lion's head is made of bamboo strips tied into an outline, pasted with paper, painted with oil colors, decorated with hair and inlaid with mirrors, and the ears, eyes, mouth, and tongue can all move. The lion's body is made of colored silk, and the tail is decorated with long hair. The lion's whiskers and eyebrows are mostly white, indicating an old lion. If the whiskers and eyebrows are black, it is a middle-aged lion. When traveling outside, it often encounters struggles from good people. Therefore, the lion's whiskers and eyebrows are mostly white for this reason. However, some villages or martial arts halls, relying on their large population and sufficient military equipment, also use lions with black eyebrows and whiskers to provoke disputes everywhere. However, other lions, smelling its tracks, usually flash in, not daring to meet it head-on, for fear of attracting death. Because in the past, lion dancers often used to seek revenge and cause trouble, sometimes leading to fights because of lion dance, but these bad habits have decreased in recent years.</p>
<p>舞腳是有他的技術·舞獅頭的循着鑼戲的節拍而動作，進退高低，左右蹲跳種種神態，舞獅尾的也同一動作，這非有嫺熟的武技，不能夠活動自如，動人視聽。</p>
<p>Dancing feet has its own skills. The lion's head dancer moves according to the rhythm of the gong opera, advancing and retreating, rising and falling, squatting and jumping left and right, and the lion's tail dancer does the same. Without skilled martial arts skills, it is impossible to move freely and be moving to the audience.</p>
<p>每一個獅子，配合的人，最要緊的舞獅頭，必有三四個人輪流換班，其次舞獅尾和準備採靑，上樓台等助手，一個戴着假面具手搖蒲扇作先導的，引人發笑。他如鼓手，鈸手，握手主持樂其。還有許多武士裝束，帶了刀槍，旗幟，錦標，籐盾等，旣助威勢，也是準備萬一的廝殺。說好一點的，是儀仗的配襯，下然，過於單調了。</p>
<p>For each lion, the most important thing is the people who cooperate. The lion's head dancer must have three or four people take turns. Secondly, there are assistants such as the lion's tail dancer and those who prepare to pick green vegetables, climb the stage, etc. A person wearing a mask and shaking a cattail fan leads the way, making people laugh. There are also drummers, cymbal players, and those who shake hands to host the music. There are also many samurai costumes, with knives, guns, flags, trophies, rattan shields, etc., which both help to increase the momentum and prepare for a possible fight. To put it nicely, it is the embellishment of the guard of honor, but of course it is too monotonous.</p>
<p>獅子採靑，是最精彩的表演，在數丈高掛着生菜或其他錦標現款等，舞獅的在鼓樂喧鬧解中，依着法式，踏在竹竿上或人的膊上，或藤盾上，一層一層的上去，表演稱種動作，把兩眼拿着，跳下來在地上慢慢地齧吞，這種工夫，是要經過相常訓練的．一個獅頭有數十斤重，舞獅的旣要把它舞弄，又要使它的口開闊，跳躍護退，或遠或臥，或急或慢，一氣呵成，而不換班。所以舞獅是合作的表示，團結的象徽，如果彼此閒失了聯緊，那就黯然無色，沒精打彩的了。</p>
<p>The lion picking green vegetables is the most exciting performance. Raw vegetables or other trophies and cash are hung several feet high. In the midst of the noisy drum music, the lion dancers, according to the style, step on bamboo poles or people's shoulders, or rattan shields, layer by layer, performing various actions, holding the two eyes, jumping down and slowly gnawing and swallowing on the ground. This kind of skill requires considerable training. A lion's head weighs dozens of pounds. The lion dancer must not only dance with it, but also make its mouth open wide, jump and retreat, far or lying down, fast or slow, all in one go, without changing shifts. Therefore, lion dance is a symbol of cooperation and unity. If the connection between each other is lost, it will be dull and lackluster.</p>
<h3>參加「作協」年會　南京去來</h3>

<h3>The More You Use Your Brain, The Smarter It Becomes. The Lazy Are Destined to Die Young. The Art of Longevity.</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Goethe, at eighty-two years old, still possessed an astonishing capacity for work, completing his masterpiece "Faust." The octogenarian Hugo consistently worked, brimming with vitality and creative energy. The renowned Italian artist Michelangelo, even in his eighties, diligently pursued his art. The great French painter Corot, on his eightieth birthday, painted one of his masterpieces.</p>
<p>Scientists exploring the secrets of longevity point out that the aforementioned artists never ceased their creative endeavors. "Fatigue," they will tell you, "is extremely dangerous for both the body and the mind. No mere lazy person will live long; only those who remain busy throughout their lives achieve longevity."</p>
<p>This comprehensive conclusion is confirmed by Dr. Oscar and Dr. Uter of the "Brain Research Institute" in Neustadt, Germany, who mentioned this in a communication with the authoritative British scientific magazine "Nature."</p>
<p>"If we allow our brains to become lazy," these two German researchers say, "we are digging our own graves."</p>
<p>Brain Cells Become Parasites</p>
<p>The limit of our lifespan is determined by the condition of our brain cells. If they are stimulated, they will be strengthened, and we can live to a ripe old age. If they are lazy and shirk work, they degenerate, and we live shorter lives than we should because our underused brains have become parasites that only eat and do not work.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of types of cells in the brain, each of which is responsible for a certain type of activity in the body. Together, they function like a superb headquarters, ensuring that the body's functions are quiet and efficient.</p>
<p>By the time we are three years old, we have acquired our lifetime supply of brain cells; they cannot reproduce themselves. The original cells acquired in childhood must directly facilitate thought, action, digestion, growth, and all the other complex processes of a living body.</p>
<p>If a cell dies, we lose it forever; nothing replaces it. If a few die, it may not have a significant impact on our personality or body. However, if an entire group dies, then certain parts of us cease to function. Thus, if the nerve center controlling the right leg dies, the right leg becomes paralyzed.</p>
<p>Uter said: "The secret to longevity is to use some working-class brain cells to strengthen them. They love activity and thrive on rapid and intense thought. If they are stimulated by countless nerve expansions, they can maintain excellent condition, and you can live a useful life far beyond the age of sixty or seventy."</p>
<p>Conversely, if you live a dull life with little stimulation, brain cells are used less. In complete frustration, they become weak and prematurely aged, hastening your death.</p>
<p>Busy People Have Healthy Brains</p>
<p>Uter and his colleagues, in their laboratories, have clearly established the fact that busy people develop strong and resilient brain cells, which means moving towards longevity.</p>
<p>"In the upbringing of individuals with special activities," they concluded, "there is a gradual possibility of delaying the normal death of the brain" (Translated from the February issue of "Reader's Digest").</p>
<h3>Bubbles</h3>
<p>— Wang Deyun</p>
<p>Yesterday, I bought a foreign bubble and happily started "blowing" it.</p>
<p>With just a light "blow," the foreign bubble immediately grew much larger, as if a poor person had suddenly become rich and fat. Another blow, and it grew even larger; another blow, and it grew much, much larger.</p>
<p>"Great! Great!" My younger sister clapped her hands, admiring my "blowing" skills.</p>
<p>I became even more self-satisfied! So I continued my efforts, blowing vigorously, but my mother, "a clear-sighted observer," couldn't help but worry for me, immediately shouting to stop me: "Okay! Don't blow anymore! It's going to burst!"</p>
<p>No sooner said than done, the words had just left her mouth when there was a "pop!" and the balloon burst on cue!</p>
<p>"It's over, poor fatso!" I couldn't help but sigh. But the bursting of the bubble brought me even more enlightenment!</p>
<h3>New Year's Greetings</h3>
<p>— Suo Ying</p>
<p>——Timely Doggerel——</p>
<p>Paying New Year's calls is tiring and wasteful, so much time, so much money! Just for everyone's sake of face, outdated customs are still followed from the past; everyone is just "going through the motions," why not abandon the custom and save "two coins"?</p>
<h3>Talking About Gold During the Spring Festival</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Congratulations on getting rich, gold ingots on display.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a saying during the Lunar New Year: "Congratulations on getting rich, gold ingots on display," to wish people good luck in the New Year.</p>
<p>Before the war, the value of gold, especially "gold ingots," was truly extraordinarily high, and not something that ordinary people possessed. But in recent years, every Tom, Dick, and Harry, rickshaw pullers, maids, nannies, and older sisters are all "laden with gold"?</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "An ounce of gold is worth four ounces of good fortune." The reason why people today have increased "good fortune" is that it has nothing to do with us intellectuals, but has been taken first by the general "laboring" workers! Isn't that so? What they and she wear and put on their hands is yellowish-green, dazzling, and enviable! Since the advent of the new Customs Gold Unit, even more people have inquired about gold. During this New Year, buying a few gold rings or gold jewelry is no big deal, and even buying "gold ingots" doesn't take much effort. Unexpectedly, my hometown's (Minhang) saying "Congratulations on getting rich, gold ingots on display" has become a "premonition"!</p>
<p>So gold, despite "rising," can be "sold" and "allocated" while it rises?</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper on the New Year, one sees the news that "about 30 tons of gold will be shipped from Mexico," which is indeed a striking news item!</p>
<p>At the same time, fearing that the price of gold will continue to rise, which is too stimulating for prices, several thousand taels have been "sold and allocated" in the first two days of the New Year. This is the "concern" after the issuance of the new Customs Gold Unit, but "rising" is still "rising," but it only makes the appearance rise more slowly!</p>
<p>"Constantly pouring out gold," "Constantly bringing gold from overseas," but ultimately unable to stop the "rising trend." In this situation, it is no wonder that the soaring cost of living for civilians cannot be "lowered" and is "at a loss"!</p>
<p>There is more and more gold in the hands of the people every day, and it will soon become a "golden country"! Where can one see today feeling "impoverished"?</p>
<p>But although "gold is everywhere," one "cannot eat when hungry" and "cannot wear clothes when cold." The fact that the price of goods and the price of gold do not have the "ratio" they had before the war is still a serious issue!</p>
<h3>God of Wealth</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>On the night of "the fourth day of the New Year," every household frantically sets off firecrackers to welcome the God of Wealth. Yes, everyone has been poor enough in this year, who doesn't welcome the God of Wealth?</p>
<p>But, God of Wealth, which house are you going to after all? Is the money you bring enough to distribute to these many wealth seekers? Do you give wealth to "good" people based on the Stove God's report? If that's the case, I must advise you: the Stove God received abundant offerings on the night of the twenty-fourth of the twelfth lunar month, quietly ascended to heaven, and played a confused tune. He was obviously bribed! The families that truly need the God of Wealth's assistance probably don't have the money to buy lavish gifts to honor the Stove God.</p>
<p>Amidst the sound of firecrackers, God of Wealth, I humbly ask you: don't be confused by the colorful offerings of wealthy families. If that's the case, I'm afraid the year of Bingxu will still be a case of "the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer"!</p>
<p>God of Wealth! Where are you going?</p>
<h3>Natural Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Muyu</p>
<p>Although he opens his mouth wide, like a political orator, as if he has great mysteries, in reality, he is just an idiot, with no political arguments to make—unless you hit his head with a stick, but there is no reaction, only answering you with one word: "Put!"</p>
<p>Funnel</p>
<p>Borrow his mouth to swallow things into other people's stomachs. Once other people's stomachs are full, they throw him away.</p>
<p>Trash can</p>
<p>Even though he himself is very clean, he has such a great capacity to accommodate filth, that he naturally becomes a synonym for all filth.</p>
<p>That being the case, in the past, the customers in silver shops were respectable gentry, but now the feng shui has changed, and they are all short-sleeved, rough-handed, and crude-footed types. This kind of "transformation" is something that even gods could not have predicted. This is also a "deformed" transformation!</p>

<h3>The Dignity of National Law, Impartiality in Public Affairs; Yang Sen's Spirit is Worth Emulating!</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>Yang Chuanshan, the younger brother of Guizhou Provincial Chairman Yang Sen, used his brother's name to smuggle two large trucks of opium while his brother was in Beijing. The matter was discovered by the detective team, who immediately telegraphed Yang Sen to ask for instructions on how to handle it. Yang Sen replied by telegram to handle it strictly. Yang Chuanshan then committed suicide by shooting himself.</p>
<p>This is a rare piece of news. In today's world where only human sentiment is valued and national law is disregarded, it is worthy of great praise that someone can "put righteousness above family" without showing favoritism.</p>
<p>The root of the Chinese problem is that they are good at "showing favoritism," applying the law differently to good and bad people, and judging crimes entirely based on human sentiment. On the surface, it seems to conform to ethical concepts, but in reality, it neglects the word "righteousness," not only failing to "put righteousness above family" but also "putting family above righteousness."</p>
<p>Having said that, Yang Sen's act of "putting righteousness above family" is what should be done! It is inevitable! It is not surprising in itself! But in today's society of favoritism, it is indeed commendable and worthy of great praise. Not only is it worthy of great praise, but it is also worthy of the government's telegram of commendation.</p>
<p>Although Chairman Yang sentenced his brother according to national law, I think Chairman Yang must be very sad in his heart. His own brother died at his own hands, which is inevitably "cruel" in terms of ethics. But national law is ultimately national law, and human sentiment cannot prevail.</p>
<p>There are too many cases like this, and I hope there are countless Yang Sens!</p>
<h3>The World of Terror</h3>
<p>— Gao Minggui</p>
<p>Science is constantly advancing, and new weapons of killing are emerging in an endless stream. After the end of World War II, scientists from various countries are still immersed in the research of new weapons, which shows that the back of this world still hides unavoidable war. The January 17th issue of the New York-published "Collier's" magazine contains an article written by Cocktone, which stated that Soviet scientists at the Remigrad Institute of Technology are trying to find a way to research a "gap" that allows the deadly ultraviolet rays in the sun to pass through the Earth's atmosphere, instantly destroying any enemy country. If the power of "ultraviolet rays" is concentrated to pass through the "atmosphere" and irradiate any enemy country, it would be enough to destroy the country and all its residents instantly, as easily as "sweeping away dead leaves."</p>
<p>If this "solar weapon" is successfully researched, its power to threaten the world and destroy mankind will be greater than that of the atomic bomb. In today's chaotic post-war situation, with the winds and clouds of Europe and Asia unpredictable, hearing this is even more shocking. Science benefits mankind a lot, but the power of harm is even greater. Today, mankind's enjoyment of material civilization has reached its peak, and the threat to life is also increasing. In reality, there is no distinction between "civilization" and "barbarism"!</p>
<h3>Dead Man's Eyeball</h3>
<p>— Wu Hong</p>
<p>Antimonde, a thirty-one-year-old Catholic priest in Reno, Nevada, lost his sight in his right eye ten years ago after being shot. Recently, a surgeon surgically implanted the eyeball from the body of a murderer who was executed for murdering a woman in Reno into Antimonde's right eye. Thirty-six hours later, he was able to see again. Doctors originally stipulated that it would take three weeks to determine whether the new surgery was successful, but the effect was so quick. The murderer, whose eyeball was borrowed after death, was executed in Nevada's "gas chamber" on the tenth of this month.</p>
<p>There used to be a legend: an omnipotent medical doctor reattached the arm of a dead thief to a cripple with a broken right arm and replaced the heart of a heart patient with a lion's heart. The surgeries were successful and seamless, but after a few days, the two people who had undergone surgery went to him. The cripple who had his arm reattached said that he often unconsciously went to steal other people's things, and the heart patient, since having a lion's heart, only wanted to eat people all day long. The medical doctor was so entangled that he committed suicide.</p>
<p>Now that a murderer's "dead man's eyeball" has been implanted in the right eye of the blind Catholic priest, I wonder if things look a little different?</p>
<p>After the Amnesty&gt;</p>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>Recently, the amnesty order has arrived at courts across the country, and they are busy handling release procedures. The number of people pardoned this time is large, a great act of grace, a glorious event for the ages. However, this large group of people has been trapped behind bars for many years, isolated from society. After being released, there are many who have no home to return to, wandering in an unfamiliar society like a flock of lost sheep, unable to find a path to self-renewal. Although they have gained freedom, they have lost their livelihood. Originally, in this day and age, "freedom and livelihood" are not easy to achieve at the same time. Therefore, among this group of people who have been released, some have asked to return to prison, and some have committed crimes again and returned to prison. Such cases are constantly emerging, forming a new and difficult social problem. However, within this cumbersome new problem, the relative importance of "freedom and livelihood" is revealed.</p>
