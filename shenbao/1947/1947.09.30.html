<h3>中國有權要求保證不再遭受日本侵害　美報同情我對日和約主張</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿八日電〕紐約前鋒論壇</p>
<p>報今著論籲請美人應予中國對未來對日和</p>
<p>約之主張，以更大之考慮。該報指出，在</p>
<p>制訂對日和約時，日本侵略中國之痛苦事</p>
<p>實，在中國人腦海中，實爲一可怖之忍受</p>
<p>，中國自有最高尚之理由，要求保證其不</p>
<p>再受日本之害。該社論之命題爲：「中國</p>
<p>與日本」。該報論稱：迄今爲止，一般對</p>
<p>美蘇兩國在分訂對日和約方面之爭執，極</p>
<p>爲重視，但美國國內對巾國方面所持之態</p>
<p>度，未嘗加以考慮。中國方面在公開表示</p>
<p>中，雖頗持重，但其對美國建議（此項建</p>
<p>議會獲大多數有關國教之同意）之不滿，</p>
<p>不下於蘇聯之不滿。美國·中國恐　未來</p>
<p>之對日和約可能使日本立即回覆其對東亞</p>
<p>之工業獨佔與軍事獨佔。職是之故，中國</p>
<p>之不願接受無强國否決權規定之任何和會</p>
<p>計劃，正與蘇聯之態度相同。該報又稱，</p>
<p>中國原曾提議先舉行中·英·蘇·美四强</p>
<p>初步對日和約會議，此將予中蘇兩國以否</p>
<p>決權（倘兩國採取共同行動）。目前似有</p>
<p>一種可能，即中國將加强其態度，而要求</p>
<p>每一强國（當然包括其本身在內）均享有</p>
<p>否決權。中國參政會駐委會參政員在其致</p>
<p>政府之報告中，建議上述方針，彼等並建</p>
<p>議；　廢止日本之「天皇制，」　日本</p>
<p>得維持其最低限度之生活水準，　　球羣</p>
<p>島及中國海外之其他島嶼，應交由中國託</p>
<p>管，及　盟國管制日本，至少應有三十年</p>
<p>。自整個言之，參政會駐委會之建議，似</p>
<p>嫌過份，但自日本侵略所加於中國之可怕</p>
<p>忍受而言，則其建議乃自然之結果。在制</p>
<p>訂對日和約時，吾人應記取中國方面實有</p>
<p>最高尚之理由，要求保證其不再爲日本所</p>
<p>害。在外表上，日本人之態度，雖似已有</p>
<p>改變，但在外表之後面，實際情形如何，</p>
<p>則不能確定。中國自有理由要求對於未來</p>
<p>安全之保證，此保證自非美國若干官員所</p>
<p>謂「日本人將於數代以內成爲和平人民」</p>
<p>之空言。</p>

<p>中韓貿易建議書，原文如下：</p>
<p>「爲建議嚴格管制中韓貿易，</p>

<p>以最近中韓貿易即將開放，中韓</p>

<h3>全國地政檢討會議開幕　蔣主席頒訓指示　認淸事實確切執行政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕全國地政檢討會議，廿九日晨在京勵志社禮堂舉行開幕禮，到王副</p>
<p>院長雲五，張部長厲生，蕭委員錚，及川席代表共百餘人。由李部長敬齋主席，領導行禮，並</p>
<p>致開會詞，略調：我國戰後土地問題，極爲重要，抗戰期中，全國地籍久經變動，亟待淸理，</p>
<p>本會主要使命在以科學方法，檢討抗戰期中地　與地權之變動，及戰後兩年來復員狀况，以實</p>
<p>現土地政策，加强土地生產，而完成耕者有其田之理想。繼由地政部主任秘書陳正　恭讀　蔣</p>
<p>主席對大會訓詞（見後），王副院長嗣即席指示兩點：　地方自治為實施憲政之基礎，而地籍</p>
<p>整理又爲地方自治之主要工作，此次大會應澈底檢討地政實施之現况，而　訂分期分區之步驟</p>
<p>：　地政工作應配合政府政策，及各有關機關之工作，相互協助共同推進，乃收事半功倍之效</p>
<p>。蕭委員錚繼致詞謂：經濟改革方案中，以擴大生產增進國家收入，以平衡國家預算，並擬成</p>
<p>立土地銀行，發行土地債券其目的在活潑金融，以達成土地之充分利用，而農　增產及農地農</p>
<p>有，爲政府旣定政策，希望大會汪意此點。蕭氏詞畢，即由上海市地政局長祝平，代表答詞後</p>
<p>，旋即禮成散會。下午三時舉行預備會及第一次會議。</p>
<p>蔣主席對全國地政檢討會議頒發訓詞如下：</p>
<p>土地乃生產三要素之一，我國</p>
<p>以農立國，人民多恃耕作爲生，</p>
<p>是以地權之分配與地力之使用如</p>
<p>何，實爲一切社會問題之　結，</p>
<p>歷代治亂興衰，幾無不與此有關</p>
<p>。國父倡導革命，首先主張平均</p>
<p>地權，其目的即在根本解決國內</p>
<p>土地問題，以實現民生均足之理</p>
<p>想，廿年來政府遵循遣敎，制爲</p>
<p>各種地政法規，期於日常行政之</p>
<p>中，潮收土地革命之效，祗以執</p>
<p>行强度不够，而社會傳統習慣不</p>
<p>易驟變，致續效未盡顯著，馴使</p>
<p>共匪得以據隙蹈瑕，藉口土地改</p>
<p>革，以遂其脅誘農民，毀壊農村</p>
<p>組織之陰謀，事之可痛，無逾於</p>
<p>此。吾人應深刻反省，認淸事實</p>
<p>，必土地政策，有確切之執行，</p>
<p>斯國家建設，方能奠不拔之基礎</p>
<p>。方今動員戡亂與準備行憲，齊</p>
<p>頭並進，亟應一面針對共匪詭倡</p>
<p>土地改革之悖亂行動，迅作正本</p>
<p>淸源之有效措施，以國結農村人</p>
<p>心，改善農民生活；一面完成地</p>
<p>方自治之基本工作，切實訓練農</p>
<p>民，行使四權，務使農民之政治</p>
<p>生活及經濟生活，均有正常健全</p>
<p>之發展，然從對於共匪陰謀，可</p>
<p>予以澈底之打撃。</p>
<p>我國各級地政機構本已普遍建</p>
<p>立，自政府容納各黨參加後，更</p>
<p>於行政院設置地政部，以加强地</p>
<p>政之推進。今當全國地政檢討會</p>
<p>議開幕之日，集中央與各地主管</p>
<p>地政人員於一堂，考査以往工作</p>
<p>之得失，群求今從努力之準繩，</p>
<p>意義極爲里大，尤以多數人員來</p>
<p>自綏靖省份，於實事實騐中，探</p>
<p>討問題之眞象，必多實貴貢獻。</p>
<p>惟地政措施，不外兩大目標：一</p>
<p>爲對於城市用地，應注重抑制土</p>
<p>地投機，取締不勞而獲，以照價</p>
<p>征稅漲價歸公爲手腕，實現市地</p>
<p>地權之平均；一爲對農村耕地，</p>
<p>應注重保障佃農扶植自耕農，以</p>
<p>漸次達到耕者有其田之目的，實</p>
<p>現農村地權之平均。近年政府對</p>
<p>於土地稅之舉辦，以及二五減租</p>
<p>之實行，僅爲兩大目標之初步工</p>
<p>作，如能推行盡利循序漸進，我</p>
<p>國土地問題，必可早日解決，尤</p>
<p>其對於綏靖區之土地行政，必須</p>
<p>根據旣定政策，恪遵現行法令，</p>
<p>堅定信念，請求技術，打破困難</p>
<p>，忠實執行，庶可遏止目前亂萌</p>
<p>樹立復興基礎。深望各同志盡其</p>
<p>所知，虛懐檢討，使地政業務圖</p>
<p>滿推進，革命使命得以　成，有</p>
<p>厚望焉。</p>

<p>部長兪飛鵬報吿卅六年度糧政工</p>
<p>作之籌劃與改進。兪氏首述軍公</p>
<p>民糧之籌劃情形稱：本年軍糧數</p>
<p>字，係根據軍隊人數標準而核定</p>
<p>，希望各部隊將來　能核實發給</p>
<p>，以免感到不敷。公糧一項，今</p>
<p>春京滬公敎人員已開始發給，連</p>
<p>少數民糧在內，月需卅萬石，平</p>
<p>津九月份起亦已辦理，月需麵粉</p>
<p>十五萬包，將來如情形允許，將</p>
<p>使此種配發範圍逐漸擴大。民食</p>
<p>方面，四聯總處購儲委員會本年</p>
<p>擬購麥五百萬石，稻一千萬石，</p>
<p>現已購得麥三百萬石，稻則委託</p>
<p>中國農民銀行購買，亦已購得五</p>
<p>百萬石，將來均擬作為調節民合</p>
<p>之用，同時，聯總擬以糧食廿萬</p>
<p>噸救濟我國沿海平民，惟我國亦</p>
<p>須撥發相當數額，此項計劃，我</p>
<p>國業已同意。兪氏總即報吿糧政</p>
<p>工作改進情形，計分經收，倉庫</p>
<p>，運輸·調配等項，逐一予以說</p>
<p>明，據稱：在經收方面，擬在交</p>
<p>通不便處民衆納糧可儘改繳法幣</p>
<p>，然後經收機關，可以此項經費</p>
<p>，向糧產區購買，以免民衆運送</p>
<p>上之各項困難，同時集體納糧亦</p>
<p>可使民衆獲得不少方便。現各地</p>
<p>倉庫均欠完善，該部擬積極建倉</p>
<p>，凡產糧之區，將設法籌建較大</p>
<p>規模之倉庫，亦須予以改善。至</p>
<p>於運輸，該部今後將隨時注意天</p>
<p>時、同時須乘農閒時，辦理運輸</p>
<p>工作。述及糧政積弊時，兪氏表</p>

<h3>苟非環境壓迫誰個願做舞女？　穗市舞孃千人集會呼籲延期執行禁舞　王孝英允代向政府請求</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿九日電〕此間全市舞女及舞業從業</p>
<p>人員，頃舉行大會，商討請求市府延期執行禁舞問</p>
<p>題。到會近千人，舞女均素妝淡沬，面有憂色。舞</p>
<p>女發言者，有黎莉莉·區紫燕·曹麗影·朱美莉·黃娉婷等</p>
<p>，一致謂：茍非環境壓迫，誰願做舞女？盼社會人士予以同</p>
<p>情，呼籲政府延期禁舞，免直接間接影響五千餘人，生活無</p>
<p>從解決。言時聲淚俱下，感動全場。立委王孝英，以粵婦女</p>
<p>職業促進會負資人資格出席該會，發言稱，跳舞爲高尙娛樂</p>
<p>，但在總動員令下，前方將士殺賊，後方民衆自應刻苦，故</p>
<p>禁舞事在必行；目前問題爲禁舞以後的救濟辦法，渠願代向</p>
<p>政府請求在不抵觸法令之下，延期執行禁舞令。各舞女均表</p>
<p>示感激。聞市常局對此問題已允予考慮，可能延期數月始執</p>
<p>行。</p>
<h3>華沙的記者招待會（續完）</h3>
<p>一位臨時翻譯員，替我每天</p>
<p>譯述重要新聞和言論，來波蘭</p>
<p>這幾天當中，三件大新聞，遮</p>
<p>蓋住所有的版面，社會黨清黨</p>
<p>，「愚蠢的」巴黎會議，和中</p>
<p>國內戰與魏德邁訪華，除了在</p>
<p>野的波蘭農民黨的機關報洛獨</p>
<p>瓦日報刋登路透，合衆，美聯</p>
<p>的中國戰訊以外，其餘都是刋</p>
<p>登淸一色的塔斯電訊。</p>
<p>許多波蘭知識份子，現在熟</p>
<p>中地關切着中國的局勢，他們</p>
<p>並不有興趣於中國的內政，而</p>
<p>是警覺着：中國的內亂，可能</p>
<p>引起另一次人類的大浩刧。</p>
<p>全歐洲現在有兩個城市，瘋</p>
<p>狂的議論着戰爭：一個是柏林</p>
<p>，另一個便是華沙。德國人講</p>
<p>戰爭，用未來的戰爭在安慰他</p>
<p>們自已，他們憧憬德意志可能</p>
<p>在下一次大戰中復活。波蘭人</p>
<p>講戰爭，却是一種激動，激動</p>
<p>又可以分做兩方面看，一種情</p>
<p>緒是想用戰爭來打開密雲不雨</p>
<p>的局面，另一種情緒是畏懼第</p>
<p>三次戰爭來臨時候，他們將遭</p>
<p>受不可思議的苦難。</p>
<p>海外奇談</p>
<p>有一支華沙市</p>
<p>事，我應該順</p>
<p>便提到：</p>
<p>一位波蘭籍的美國科學家，</p>
<p>在美國參與原子炸彈的硏究工</p>
<p>作，有一天，爲了探視親戚，</p>
<p>忽然回到了華沙，許多彼蘭友</p>
<p>好，圍着他講「海外奇談」，</p>
<p>最後終於講到了原子彈問題。</p>
<p>那位科學家大吹特吹美國原</p>
<p>子彈的威力，「廣島一顆炸彈</p>
<p>，死了六十五萬人，將來的戰</p>
<p>爭，就是原子彈戰爭！」</p>
<p>有位華沙朋友問：「如果像</p>
<p>倫敦那樣大的一座都市，要用</p>
<p>若干原子彈，總能够將它毀滅</p>
<p>？」</p>
<p>科學家沉吟了半　，拿起鉛</p>
<p>筆，從土地人口的分佈，工業</p>
<p>設備等等逐步計算，最後算出</p>
<p>了結果：「大約得用四顆原子</p>
<p>彈！」</p>
<p>那位靑年又問：「那末，像</p>
<p>法國這麼一個大國，要用若干</p>
<p>原子彈，　能將它的大城市，</p>
<p>大工業，交通命脈，完全摧毀</p>
<p>呢？」</p>
<p>科學家費了大力，算了很久</p>
<p>很久，說：「至少得十四顆原</p>
<p>子炸彈，可以將法國炸得抬不</p>
<p>起頭來！」</p>
<p>「那這究竟要多少原子炸彈</p>
<p>，纔能毀滅像蘇俄那樣一個更</p>
<p>廣大的國家呢？」</p>
<p>科學家毫不違疑地說：「一</p>
<p>百七十八顆！」</p>
<p>這段故事流傳在華沙，非常</p>
<p>普遍。事實上，就我在歐洲所</p>
<p>聽見的，已不止在華沙一處，</p>
<p>不過波蘭人特別敏感，特別喜</p>
<p>歡傳誦，而且講得有聲有色。</p>
<p>謠言製造着波蘭的恐懼，和</p>
<p>法國人同樣聰明的波蘭人，愈</p>
<p>聽多謠言，便愈感到他本身是</p>
<p>一個「悲劇」，他們雖然在「</p>
<p>鐵簾」背後，但他們並不像其</p>
<p>它的斯拉夫人一樣，迷信他們</p>
<p>的「領袖」會百戰百勝。</p>
<p>外紅裏白</p>
<p>就戰後的地理</p>
<p>環境說，波蘭</p>
<p>是鐵簾的前衛</p>
<p>。他們和英美容易接觸，容易</p>
<p>了解。就文化的觀點言，波蘭</p>
<p>人一向是西歐文化的有力播種</p>
<p>者，特別是法蘭西文化的忠實</p>
<p>實行者。</p>
<p>在華沙，幾乎每一個波蘭人</p>
<p>都會講法語，法語愈精通，顯</p>
<p>示他的社會地位愈祟高，路易</p>
<p>皇帝時代，法蘭西的宮庭禮節</p>
<p>，在巴黎已經不復再見了，但</p>
<p>是在波蘭，却深深地所謂高等</p>
<p>社會中留存着，沒有一側歐洲</p>
<p>國家的男人，會那樣認眞地吻</p>
<p>女賓的手，甚至在最貧窮的波</p>
<p>蘭人家中，都不能忽路那麼些</p>
<p>禮節。</p>
<p>打仗以前，波蘭的中小學校</p>
<p>都敎授法語，這是波蘭敎育部</p>
<p>規定的必修外國語。現在，公</p>
<p>立學校都在敎俄文，私立的「</p>
<p>英語夜校」風行一時，家庭敎</p>
<p>師授英語一點鐘，耍五百「紙</p>
<p>落堆」（波幣名稱），敎一點</p>
<p>法語，祇要二百。</p>
<p>德語在波蘭也是異常普遍，</p>
<p>那是因爲五年被征服的結果。</p>
<p>波蘭人的心目中，就文化一點</p>
<p>來說，他是小視俄羅斯，而尊</p>
<p>重西歐國家的。又因爲德意志</p>
<p>是它的世　，環境造成他需要</p>
<p>拉攏法蘭西，第一次歐洲以後</p>
<p>的波蘭復國運動，法國是一個</p>
<p>有力的支助者。</p>
<p>當今掌棉波蘭軍事命脈的國</p>
<p>防部長兼陸軍總司令謝米耳斯</p>
<p>基元帥，他就是一個標準的「</p>
<p>法國化」的人物，他從前在法</p>
<p>國軍官學校念書，後來參與畢</p>
<p>蘇斯基將軍領導的復國運動，</p>
<p>畢蘇斯基將軍的後期政權，親</p>
<p>近納粹法西斯，謝米耳斯基掛</p>
<p>冠而去，又重復回到法蘭西，</p>
<p>納粹佔領波蘭期間，謝米耳斯</p>
<p>基來往於法波之問，做「地下</p>
<p>運動」，後來方和蘇俄方面取</p>
<p>得聯絡。</p>
<p>現在進進出出於波蘭國防部</p>
<p>的，全是些戴紅星帽的俄羅斯</p>
<p>軍事顧問，也有人說：要面有</p>
<p>不少穿便服的化裝的俄國人的</p>
<p>在工作，但是，彼蘭人仍然相</p>
<p>信，謝米耳斯基本身是「外紅</p>
<p>裏自」，意思即是說，他的職</p>
<p>務不能不和俄國人打交道，然</p>
<p>而他的內心，是完全沒有「赤</p>
<p>化」了的。</p>
<p>我沒有去國防部訪問，我也</p>
<p>不知道這些是眞是假。外籍記</p>
<p>者們常常提出許多離奇的謠傳</p>
<p>，問葛羅蚩將軍，有一次，不</p>
<p>知那一位記者說：「華沙市上</p>
<p>，最近盛傳蘇俄也要召集一次</p>
<p>會議，和巴黎會議對抗，請問</p>
<p>到底是眞是假？」葛羅蚩將軍</p>
<p>非常聰明的回答說：吿訴你，</p>
<p>在歐洲大陸上，有一個謠言最</p>
<p>多的城市，這個城市就呌做華</p>
<p>沙！」（於布列斯特飯店）</p>

<h3>宋子文飛粵主政</h3>
<p>宋子文氏於木月十九日經行政院政務會議通</p>
<p>過任命爲粵省主席，已定今天飛粵履新；宋氏如</p>
<p>何展布其新猷，或當成竹在胸。聽說宋氏此行，</p>
<p>過了兩旬左右，行將軍蒞首都，屆時粵省政府人</p>
<p>事容有若干調整，以利省政革新之推行。</p>
<p>宋氏此次主粵，距其辭去行政院長職務，約</p>
<p>經半年。以宋氏過去在國民黨的歷史，爲國家從</p>
<p>政的經騐，和他果敢負責的辦事性格而論，又正</p>
<p>當「强仕之年」，此次重登政治無臺，原爲常事。</p>
<p>惟中外人土所以特別注目者，無非以爲宋氏以卸</p>
<p>任行政院長選任官之尊，何以竟願屈就簡任的省</p>
<p>主席。殊不知這種名位官階的觀念，決非革命黨</p>
<p>人心理所想到。「做大事，不必做大官」，早爲</p>
<p>國父寶貴的遺訓，宋氏固是一個拳拳服膺的信徒</p>
<p>。而况粵省爲宋氏桑梓之鄉，又當水災慘重之後</p>
<p>，加以走私猖獗，匪徒出沒，中樞旣寄以重望，</p>
<p>革命黨人豈能固作退休之想？宋氏能够服從政府</p>
<p>的命令，丟開了名位官階的「面子」俗念，投到</p>
<p>國家目前最需要他的地方去努力，實在是爲中國</p>
<p>政治開了一種新風氣·行政院張院畏最近說「人</p>
<p>才實邊」，宋氏此行，倒眞是「人才實邊」的第一</p>
<p>砲。</p>
<p>廣東爲革命策源地，宋氏又爲親炙革命導師</p>
<p>的一人。今天的廣束，正如孫副主席所說較北伐</p>
<p>時代退步已多，需要有才能有魄力而又深得中樞</p>
<p>倚畀的人如宋氏者，大刀闊斧、重幹一番革新的</p>
<p>事業。將來粵省人事調整之際，我們更盼望宋氏</p>
<p>能够因地制宜，大公無私的，爲廣東物色第一流</p>
<p>的人才，共同努力於地方政治的刷新。</p>
<p>爲了宋氏的主粵，我們也願乘此向中樞當局</p>
<p>貢獻一些意見：憲法上對中央與地方的權限，已</p>
<p>明定爲「均權」，省乃成爲高級地方自治組織，故</p>
<p>準備行憲的中樞當局，自應改變過去的觀念，提</p>
<p>高省政府的職權，讓一些有抱負有才能的主席，</p>
<p>可以督率他們的幹部，爲一個革新地方政治解除</p>
<p>人民痛苦的總目標而努力。中央但須督導考核，</p>
<p>而不必事事掣肘，使地方官有職無權，深威動輒</p>
<p>得咎之苦。共次，談到地方政治，軍民分治，文</p>
<p>人主政，近來幾已成爲耳熟能詳的爛調，但若干</p>
<p>省分的軍人主席，外間久傳或有更調，而中央迄</p>
<p>今尙在猶豫之中。此固爲時局的動盪，爲人選的</p>
<p>愼重，不得不然，但在非綏靖地區的省府，如能</p>
<p>本惟賢惟才之旨，物色文人主政，也未始不是與</p>
<p>民更始，一新耳目的辦法。</p>
<h3>全國地政會議的召開</h3>
<p>全國地政會議昨日揭幕於首都。此一會議之</p>
<p>召開，據地政部長李敬齋氏在開會辭中稱：「爲</p>
<p>我國破天荒之舉，亦爲地政部成立以來之第一次</p>
<p>會議」。　蔣主席重視地政，於此一會議召開之</p>
<p>日，特頒訓詞，對於此後地政之推行，多所指示</p>
<p>。我們對於全國地政會議的召開，感覺意義深長</p>
<p>，除祝會議成功，會後當局能厲行大會決議，實</p>
<p>行地政革新外，願再約略有所論列。</p>
<p>我國以農立國，垂數千年，土地問題便成爲</p>
<p>社會問題之根本。誠如主席所昭示：「歷代紛爭</p>
<p>，治亂興衰，無不與土地問題有關」。故國父</p>
<p>主張平均地權，確爲中國社會問題根本解決的辦</p>
<p>法。按照三民主義之土地政策，原有明確之指示</p>
<p>，一則曰平均地權，一則曰耕者有其地，其重心</p>
<p>在「均權」，有「有」：是則三民主義之土地政策不</p>
<p>在土地之立卽國有，或土地的社會化，而在維護</p>
<p>土地的私有制度，但爲公共利益計、政府得依法</p>
<p>對私有土地的使用予以限制。目前共匪騷擾農村</p>
<p>，政府則動員戡亂，可見安定民生，鞏固農村人</p>
<p>心，尤爲重要。所望我地政當局能恪遵國父遺</p>
<p>敎及此次地政會議主席所頒之訓詞，對三民主</p>
<p>義之土地政策爲忠實之推行，庶幾我飽經災難的</p>
<p>農民得以稍資喘息，農村建設，纔有光明的遠</p>
<p>景。</p>
<p>此次地政會議所可能討論到的範圍，當頗廣</p>
<p>泛。據報傳消息，會議提案，大要有：　設立土</p>
<p>地銀行，配合土地政策：　加强扶助自耕農；</p>
<p>開設集體農塲合作農塲等。由於對建制度在中國</p>
<p>消滅已久，大宗承襲之法不行，故在中國，實在</p>
<p>沒有眞止大地主的存在·我們所有的大地主，大</p>
<p>率爲憑藉勢力兼併而來，並非世襲，與戰前歐洲</p>
<p>日本的大地主相比較，不可同日而語。在東北以</p>
<p>及華北，自耕農的比例就很高。但因爲遺產的承</p>
<p>襲一分再分，自耕農耕地的面積也日益减少，因</p>
<p>而對農業生產，蒙上了一層極不利於機械耕耘的</p>
<p>陰影。我們希望此次地政會議，在扶助自耕農及</p>
<p>保障佃農方面，能有妥善可行的決策。</p>
<p>講到集體農塲，此原爲蘇聯實行五年計劃後</p>
<p>所推行的政策，其目的在剷除自耕農，以達到土</p>
<p>地國有或土地社會化的目的。論其精神，原與三</p>
<p>民主義的土地政策未必相容。至於合作農塲，其</p>
<p>性質與集體農塲殊異。我國目前多耕地面積極少</p>
<p>的自耕農，此項合作農塲制的採行，或正足以達</p>
<p>到加强扶助自耕農的目的。關於合作農塲制度，</p>
<p>究應如何　訂，始可推行盡利，尤望此次地政會</p>
<p>議能有愼密的研討。</p>
<p>關於金融方面，年來我政府對於農民土地經</p>
<p>濟實已相當注意，旣有中國農民銀行之設置，復</p>
<p>有中央合作金庫之創立，此外國家行局若中央信</p>
<p>託局等對於農業土地金融，亦首負責調劑。此際</p>
<p>是否應於原有系統之外。卽時別創土地銀行，當</p>
<p>有從長計議的必要。與其考慮尙未成熟，而卽另</p>
<p>立規模，似不如責成現有金融機關，改變眼光，</p>
<p>注其重點於農村土地之貸款，使農民資金得有融</p>
<p>通的機會。</p>
<p>此外，在地政方面，我們所應做的事正多，</p>
<p>極盼此次破天荒的地政會議，對於我國今後的地</p>
<p>政革新，能够樹立良好的基礎。</p>

<h3>杜魯門召集會議商援歐緊急措施　本年內估計亟需五億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿九日廣播：杜　門總統今日上午十時與國會領袖十一人及政府顧問六人開</p>
<p>會，會商美國能否不召開國會特別會議而以緊急援助給予歐洲各國之問題，抑平國內物價問題</p>
<p>亦將涉及。馬歇爾國務卿特自紐約趕返華府，俾就歐洲之嚴重糧食情形，陳述意見。據馬卿稱</p>
<p>：對於歐洲此種局勢，美國決不能袖手旁觀，務須年底以前，予以援助。據悉，杜魯門認爲此</p>
<p>項緊急費用，在未來四個月中，至少需款五億元。法義兩國，需要援助尤甚。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕杜魯門總統定今日標準時問下午三時，在白宮晤國會兩院領袖，</p>
<p>請彼等支持過渡性以及長期性之援歐計劃，並擬對國內之高物價及國外之飢荒展開雙面戰爭。</p>
<p>若杜魯門不能獲得國會領袖之合作，以實行即時性的援歐，則歐洲由於缺乏美元，糧食，及燃</p>
<p>料，不免愈近崩潰。馬歇爾國務卿已於昨夜自紐約趕回華府，會同商長哈立曼，農長安特森，</p>
<p>副國務卿洛維德，參加總統與國會領袖之談話。此次會談決定之問題將有下列數端：　國會領</p>
<p>袖將同意動用聯邦機構若進出口銀行及物品貸款銀團等之現右資金總額約五億元，以急救面臨</p>
<p>不能容忍的凍餒之諸國，尤其是義大利及法國乎？　國會領袖是否承認有召開國會特別會之必</p>
<p>要？　俟美國正式接受復興歐洲之任務後，意即今冬之緊急危機渡過以後，國會領袖對於馬歇</p>
<p>爾援歐計劃是否能予同樣的時別注意？　國會領袖是否將支持杜魯門之少浪費遝動，使現訂之</p>
<p>糧食出口目標不致再减？　國會領袖是否承認有經由立法程序，恢復政府之若干戰時特權，以</p>
<p>使今冬得以足量穀物，接濟歐洲之需要？</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕馬歇爾定今夜自紐約飛返此間，與杜魯門及國會兩黨領袖會商。</p>
<p>馬歇爾祗擬於廿九日在此間勾留一日，會後當夜即飛返紐約。馬歇爾前曾表示渠贊同召開國會</p>
<p>特會，預料渠將對國愈領袖呼籲。數日前馬歇爾在華府時，渠曾與杜魯門討論召開特會事，但</p>
<p>開總統仍不贊成採取此一辦法，聞杜魯門仍主張暫行等待，直至明年一月六日正式國會召開之</p>
<p>日。馬歇爾一再強調歐洲不能等待援歐計劃之發展，而需立即加以援助。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕無論杜魯門決定召開特別會議與否，而要求立即對國內物價及國</p>
<p>外救濟問題採取行政決定之壓力，已日見高漲。若干美國官員對根據馬歇爾計劃下之歐洲之「</p>
<p>自助」保證，皆採取觀望態度，彼等研究西歐國家所提出之報吿後稱：西歐國家之呼籲似在「</p>
<p>要求援助」，而並不在馬歇爾建議之「自助」。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾援歐計劃短期內不易實現　國會似難採取迅速行動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國會對於馬歇爾計劃作迅速</p>
<p>決定性行動之希望，已吿减少。據目前預測，即使特別國會</p>
<p>召開，亦非至十二月不能開會，而立法手續亦非至明年四月</p>
<p>不能完成。若干專家認爲歐洲所提建議雖具有合理之計劃，</p>
<p>但杜魯門及國務院欲說服國會，謂歐洲具有嚴軍危機，而必</p>
<p>須在歐洲能推行自助能力前，予以最大限度之援助，其事頗</p>
<p>爲困難。</p>
<p>十六國經濟會議之報吿恰發表</p>
<p>於國際多事之一週，其顯著特徽</p>
<p>，可得而言者，有下列數事：</p>
<p>美官方深悉在馬歇爾計劃能充分</p>
<p>考慮前，對歐洲彌補短缺之援助</p>
<p>，刻不容緩；　關於召開特別國</p>
<p>會問題，若干高級官員躊躇不決</p>
<p>；　維辛斯基之演說，引起美國</p>
<p>與論發生各種不同程度之混亂與</p>
<p>憤概；　在十六國會議之報吿發</p>
<p>表後，兩院議員採取極爲小心之</p>
<p>態度。美國專家對十六國報吿書</p>
<p>中提供事實之鑑定，業已感覺困</p>
<p>難，以該報告之草擬，乃以籠統</p>
<p>廣大地區爲其根據，而非詳細正</p>
<p>確分析某數國家或某一區域也。</p>
<p>美國對該報吿料將就下列各項</p>
<p>，作冗長之辯論：　美國援助達</p>
<p>該報吿所要求之程度，是否將使</p>
<p>美國負祖過重。　是否有其他方</p>
<p>法，可以代替政府貸款，例如恢</p>
<p>復大規模之私人投資等。　西歐</p>
<p>自力更生計劃，如不將若干更東</p>
<p>之國家，如波蘭，捷克等包括在</p>
<p>內，是否適宜。　美國援歐計劃</p>
<p>，是否必須以送禮之形式出之，</p>
<p>抑有其他代替方法，可資商討。</p>
<h3>康納利等反對召開國會特會</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕杜</p>
<p>魯門總統定明日召開重要會議，</p>
<p>參院民主黨領袖康納利與魯加斯</p>
<p>二人亦在被邀之列，彼等對於召</p>
<p>開國會特別會議一節，詔爲無此</p>
<p>必要。魯氏今日稱，目前國會如</p>
<p>果舉行特別會議，恐不致有何成</p>
<p>就。康氏則稱，國會特別會議盼</p>
<p>能避免舉行；除馬歇爾計劃外，</p>
<p>有何要事須待討論，余無所悉。</p>
<h3>裴柏主張擴大援歐計劃範圍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕衆</p>
<p>議員裴柏雖否認渠與華萊士之外</p>
<p>交政策已吿破裂，然又保證無條</p>
<p>件支持馬歇爾計劃，復興非共產</p>
<p>主義之西歐。裴柏稱：西歐國家</p>
<p>交與美國之報吿書中，並無渠所</p>
<p>深懼之政治意義在內，渠將贊同</p>
<p>此一計劃，但渠堅持將該計劃之</p>
<p>範圍擴大至包括在蘇聯領導下之</p>
<p>東部歐洲在內。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿九日廣播：成功湖訊：希臘副總理兼外</p>
<p>長蔡爾達里斯，今日在聯大政治委員會發表演說，提出警吿</p>
<p>稱，有南保阿三國對希臘之攻擊不予停止，則美國援希三億</p>
<p>元以反抗共產主義之計劃，勢將失敗。蔡氏並就葛羅米柯對</p>
<p>希臘政府所作之攻擊，提出答覆，認爲企圖使歐洲東西分裂</p>
<p>者，並非希臘，實係其北鄰三國云。</p>
<p>蔡爾達里斯認爲希臘間題，爲一極嚴重之問題，其能否獲</p>
<p>致合理解決，有關聯合國機構之整個前途。蔡氏否認希臘正</p>
<p>在發動另一次戰爭，對南保阿三國之資助希臘游擊隊，攻擊</p>
<p>不遺餘力，並要求聯合國採取行動，加以制止。渠認爲英美</p>

<h3>電車工人違法罷工市長宣佈處置辦法　延不復工者無條件解僱</h3>
<p>「本報訊」吳市長爲電車工人罷工事，昨日午後五時特在市府會議室招待記者，發表市政當局對</p>
<p>此事之態度及處置辦法四項；　煽動罷工者，按總動員法令，予以嚴懲。　罷工期內，工資不發。</p>
<p>攔阻開車者，由警備司令部警察局派員當埸立予逮捕，以妨害交通，危害公衆安全論罪，並得依</p>
<p>軍法嚴辦。　必要時，並將飭令社會局將延不復工者名單抄錄，作自動　職論，而予無條件解　，</p>
<p>由　於駕駛之失業工人　補。</p>
<p>市長首謂：英法商兩電車公司工人罷工，都未罷合法手續，且觸犯勞工法與總動員法令。此衆受</p>
<p>愚之工人，　係受共匪利用。工人　詞謂生活指數與實際不符，實際上指數均係按據科學方法編製</p>
<p>，日與總工會所得數字，　相符合，足證其之準確性。總工會前會通告各會員，若有疑賓，　可向</p>
<p>工會質詢，乃今不依合法順序請求，遽爾罷工，　係奸匪之揭亂行為。市長未並謂：希望善良工人</p>
<p>，勿聽信搗亂者之　言，而作無謂犧牲。</p>
<p>攔車抗捕者格殺勿論</p>
<p>「中央社訊」警局　局長叔平吿記者，英商電</p>
<p>車工人，昨已開始復工。法商電車工人之科紛，</p>
<p>今日亦可獲解決。惟昨日發現有若干不肖之徒沿途攔軍，企圖阻止復工，繼續擯大事態，業已分令</p>
<p>各分局嚴加注意，如續發現欄車者，立即予以逮捕法辦，若彼等企圖武力抗拒，當塲格殺勿論。</p>
<h3>英商電車恢復行駛　社局訓令母中奸計工會議決立即復工</h3>
<p>「本報訊」英商電車昨午後起已絡續恢復行</p>
<p>駛，今日可望全部復工。但法商電車及公共汽</p>
<p>車昨日仍未駛出，故市內大部份公共交通仍祗</p>
<p>賴市公用局公共汽車維持，各站搭客倍覺擁擠</p>
<p>。且昨日適値中秋節，市民來往忙碌，三輪車</p>
<p>及人力車遂莫不利市百倍。</p>
<p>昨晨英商匯山車廠之七路·八路·十路及十</p>
<p>一路四綫卅六輛車，變通辦法，</p>
<p>專駛八路及十路，共出動卅三輛</p>
<p>，按時開出。靜安寺車廠因職工</p>
<p>罷工，有軌無軌各綫均吿停頓。</p>
<p>社會局於上午有訓令一件送達英</p>
<p>商電車產業工會，內稱：「査電</p>
<p>軍公共汽車等事業關係公衆交通</p>
<p>，本不許任意停業，値此國家總</p>
<p>動員期內尤不得擅自罷工怠工，</p>
<p>迭經明令飭遵在案。該工會平時</p>
<p>行動尙屬循良，在此非常時期，</p>
<p>自應努力工作以維護大衆之利益</p>
<p>。據報該會一部份工人竟於昨日</p>
<p>無故龍工，以生活費指數不準確</p>
<p>之藉口，但亦並未經由該工會依</p>
<p>法甲請本局核辦，顯係有人從中</p>
<p>煽動，故意擾亂。査生活費指數</p>
<p>係由市政府調査編製辦理，向極</p>
<p>審愼，且每次公佈之前，均邀集</p>
<p>有關各機關派員共同審査以昭核</p>
<p>實，事屬技術性質，均有數字可</p>
<p>據，斷無任意增損之可能。况代</p>
<p>表全市工人之總工會亦於本月中</p>
<p>另行編查，其編製之數字與市政</p>
<p>府所統計者大致相同，尤可見本</p>
<p>市生活費指數絕對準確。仰該工</p>
<p>會本此意旨，剴切曉論並督導全</p>
<p>體曾員即日復工照常工作，母中</p>
<p>奸人之狡計，致妨礙公衆之交通</p>
<p>，是爲至要。</p>
<p>工人接訓令　開緊急會議</p>
<p>工會</p>
<p>奉令後</p>
<p>即將此</p>
<p>一訓令</p>
<p>全文於車廠前公吿週知，並附稱</p>
<p>，「査此次不幸事件，本會事前</p>
<p>事後均未得悉，顯係假藉名義者</p>
<p>有作用之行動，希我會員一體遵</p>

<p>常工作，毋得遠背。如有理由原</p>
<p>委，可向本會申述，當爲轉行請</p>
<p>核，切勿受他人之利用爲要」。</p>
<p>工會並於晨十時半在會所召開第</p>
<p>二十三次理監事緊急會議，決議</p>
<p>：由工會立即發動開車復工行動</p>
<p>，如有車輛中途被阻，請軍警隨</p>
<p>車保護。至於本月份生活指數不</p>
<p>準確事由工會呈請當局修正之。</p>
<p>職工雖値過節召集不易，但在工</p>
<p>會勸導下，到午十二時半即首光</p>
<p>有二路有軌電車數輛開出，之後</p>
<p>絡續有開出，迄晚靜安車廠有軌</p>
<p>無軌各綫恢復行駛者，計二路二</p>
<p>十輛，二十路二十輛，二十四路</p>
<p>七輛，三路三輛。據工會方面表</p>
<p>示，今日可能全部恢復行駛。</p>

<h3>水祥雲談話釋指數疑賓</h3>
<p>英商電車公司工人藉口對九月</p>
<p>份生活指數發生懐疑，致有停工</p>
<p>情事，總工會水理事長昨發表談</p>
<p>話如下：「是項指數雖由市府硏</p>
<p>究室主編，但本會亦於本月起托</p>
<p>各工會調査物價，送交本會另行</p>
<p>編製，所得數字與此次市府所編</p>
<p>定之數字大致相同。其原因本月</p>
<p>物價中如自粳雖大漲，但工人食</p>
<p>米以秈米爲標準，秈米價格本月</p>
<p>仍在卅萬左右，且由政府配售每</p>
<p>人二斗，以二十四萬元作價，煤</p>
<p>球市價雖逾八萬，但政府配售每</p>
<p>人一担，價爲二萬八千元，貪糖</p>
<p>雖亦飛漲，但政府配售每人一斤</p>
<p>，均與市價相差甚巨，生活指數</p>
<p>中上項數項主要物品均依配價計</p>
<p>算，外界不明內情，致起疑處。</p>
<p>各工會如有疑義，儘可向本曾査</p>
<p>詢編製材料內容，當能證明此事</p>
<p>之無誤」云。</p>

<p>緣該工程處工務組，會以由行</p>
<p>政院善後救濟總署購得竹節鋼，</p>
<p>交換亞洲實業公司機器四部，其</p>
<p>交換行爲，有逾本身職權範圍，</p>
<p>且購料公文，係空白帶滬，隨時</p>
<p>任意塡寫，請購數量不盡實在，</p>
<p>購到後含糊提取，交換價値，按</p>
<p>諸行總報價，尤使路局方面蒙受</p>
<p>莫大損失，其預謀套購，勾串舞</p>
<p>弊情形，顯然可見。　糾舉南匯</p>
<p>縣長徐泉疏忽失職，鄉長朱雲軒</p>
<p>擅自募捐案，該南匯縣遠北鄕鄕</p>
<p>長朱雲軒，經募捐款，多未經報</p>
<p>縣核准，且利利利用職權妄用武力，</p>

<p>事要求賠償部份移民庭。判決理由主旨有四：　被吿雖</p>
<p>稱其手槍爲人所奪，致彈發擊斃</p>
<p>劉李二人，但被吿並不能指出何</p>
<p>人奪槍。　所稱被告若無槍在手</p>
<p>，早被　毀之六七工人擊倒。但</p>
<p>查被告並未受傷，足見被告持槍</p>
<p>在手。　吿訴人劉李氏及錢海龍</p>
<p>高宏業等一致攻擊被吿先發一槍</p>
<p>，打倒劉集麟，再發一槍，打倒</p>
<p>李鎮，見到未死，後補一槍，足</p>
<p>證被告犯罪事實。　廠中工人均</p>
<p>從手，被告為防衛計，衹須開朝</p>
<p>天搶恐嚇，已足達到防衛目的。</p>
<p>在庭旁聽之中紡工人百餘人聞判</p>
<p>，均表示佘敬成被「冤枉」，聚</p>
<p>集地院廣場，手執小旗，在壁上</p>
<p>貼標語，並用粉筆寫口號，歷久</p>
<p>不散，要求判佘無罪，佘後由法</p>
<p>警由後門押解出院，至提籃橋監</p>
<p>獄執行。中紡各工人聞訊，仍堅</p>
<p>持不離，至五時許，始經市參議</p>

<h3>申報「助學金」徵募最後一天</h3>
<p>昨天</p>
<p>是農曆</p>
<p>中秋節</p>
<p>，讀者</p>
<p>們一定</p>
<p>會盡情的歡樂了一天罷但但是，在偌大的都市裏面，無數</p>
<p>的窮苦靑年正在爲他們的學業苦惱，不少的家長正在爲子</p>
<p>弟的學費着急。當然，他們是不會有優閑的心情去賞月，</p>
<p>同時也不會有多餘的金錢去吃月餅的。</p>
<p>親愛的續者，假使你們能够節省一點糜　，捐一些錢給</p>
<p>「讀者助學金」，也許一個快要遭受到失學厄運的靑年，</p>
<p>會因此得到續學的機會罷！</p>

<p>讀者們乘最後的機會，對淸寒的學生多給一點援助，使「</p>
<p>讀者助學金」有一個完滿的結束。</p>
<h3>節約競送禮中秋偏無月</h3>
<p>「本報訊」昨爲舊曆中</p>
<p>秋佳節，各機關學校均未</p>
<p>放假，銀錢業亦照常營業</p>
<p>，銀根奇緊，票據交換數</p>
<p>額空前激增，證券市場貼</p>
<p>息二角五分至二角八分。</p>
<p>然而各方雖在此節約聲中</p>
<p>，對餽贈送禮奮習，仍未</p>
<p>能廢除，月餅鷄鴨之銷路</p>
<p>旣佳，蔬菜魚肉等更因需</p>
<p>要激增，價格亦較平時增</p>
<p>高多多。交通方面因電車</p>
<p>尙未全部復工，三輪車及</p>
<p>人力車乘機抬價，馬路上</p>
<p>但見各軍相接，宛似長龍</p>
<p>。仰望夭空，竟日密雲不</p>
<p>雨，迄夜未見皓月露面。</p>
<p>家家依然競燒香斗，燃放</p>
<p>爆竹如儀，在颯爽晚風中</p>
<p>，度此無月之團圓節焉。</p>

<h3>參會申述理由四點請重行考慮禁舞令</h3>
<p>函送市府呈報政院核示</p>
<p>「大報訊</p>
<p>」市參議會</p>
<p>此次大會對</p>
<p>於禁舞問題</p>
<p>，曾決議「</p>
<p>由本會申敍</p>
<p>理由，請中</p>
<p>央重行考慮</p>
<p>禁舞明令，</p>
<p>本市對此項</p>
<p>明令，請市</p>
<p>政府暫　執</p>
<p>行。」該會</p>
<p>已於昨日將</p>
<p>此項決議案</p>
<p>辦理完畢，</p>
<p>函送市府，</p>
<p>並呈報政院</p>
<p>核示。其申</p>
<p>敍理由略稱</p>
<p>，「　中央爲期達成戡亂建國之任務</p>
<p>，號召全國國民厲行節約，辭嚴義正</p>
<p>，本會代表全市市民，無不竭誠擁運</p>
<p>，其各項實施辦法，亦已勉盡協助推</p>
<p>行之力。惟於禁止營業性舞場營業一</p>
<p>端，經再四攷慮，實感未盡妥善。人</p>
<p>民於不　背法律　　以內得自由選擇</p>
<p>職業及營業，此爲訓政時期約法賦予</p>
<p>人民之自由，亦民主國家國民應享之</p>
<p>基本權利，除非有妨害公共利益者，</p>
<p>國家始得以法律限制或禁止之。</p>
<p>向無禁止規定</p>
<p>舞場營業，</p>
<p>由來已久，</p>
<p>僅見動府有管理及課稅之立法，向無</p>
<p>明文禁止之規定，足見尙非妨害公共</p>
<p>利益之營業。若以已經公布亟待實施</p>
<p>之中華民國憲法而論，則對私人合法</p>
<p>之營業，更無若何拘束，故禁舞命令</p>
<p>似不免限制人民合法營業之自由。</p>
<p>舞蹈爲世界各文明國認爲正常娛樂之</p>
<p>一種，故無論爲社會交際或國際聯歡</p>
<p>，茶舞或餐舞之舉行，習以爲常，中</p>
<p>央初亦無禁絕茶舞或餐舞之規定。是</p>
<p>則跳舞原則上並未禁止，惟獨禁止營</p>
<p>業性舞場而已。</p>
<p>舞場無碍節約</p>
<p>設若以營業</p>
<p>性舞塲為不</p>
<p>節約而加以取締，則就本市而論，營</p>
<p>業舞塲三十家之　，其所消耗者，茶</p>
<p>水菓點而已，視有餐舞設備之酒樓菜</p>
<p>館，消耗孰多。設若以營業性舞塲備</p>
<p>有舞女爲未妥，則舞女以勞務換取報</p>
<p>酬，旣於物資未增其消耗，更與節約</p>
<p>本義，並無關涉。而社會上　背　約</p>
<p>，擾亂經濟，妨碍風化，影饗秩序之</p>
<p>不良現象，遠勝於舞塲者，更不知凡</p>
<p>幾，亦尙未見政府之嚴予取締。故禁</p>
<p>舞命令之於節約原旨，未免有舍本逐</p>
<p>未之嫌。</p>
<p>徒增失業羣衆</p>
<p>本市營業</p>
<p>性舞場三十</p>
<p>家之譜，從業人員多至數萬人，有一</p>
<p>間接恃爲生活者何止二十萬人，直接</p>
<p>一且盡行禁止營業，立即使二十萬人</p>
<p>陷於失業與　饉慘怖情况之中，將予</p>
<p>社會安定以極大之威脅。戡亂期間，</p>
<p>後方之安定，其重耍宜不亞於前方之</p>
<p>作戰，深恐禁止營業性舞堪以後。節</p>
<p>約遝動未必能全收效果，而徒使社會</p>
<p>陡增失業　衆，治安或受影響，將有</p>
<p>治絲益紊之慮。</p>
<p>辦法仍感難行</p>
<p>本會擁護</p>
<p>國策，未敢</p>
<p>後人，而牧大多數市民之意見，轉</p>
<p>於政府，尤爲職責所在。至若市府所</p>
<p>訂分期禁止之辦法，雖較爲緩和，然</p>
<p>經詳盡商討之後，仍感窒礙難行之處</p>
<p>尚多。揆之憲法，中央地方　採均權</p>
<p>，由中央立法　執行者，類多動關國</p>
<p>家大計，宜涉全國一致之事。列舉項</p>
<p>目，規定範圍，以吾國幅員之廣大，</p>
<p>風俗之各殊，若舞塲一類，應禁與否</p>
<p>，與其由中樞作硬性之規定，不如由</p>
<p>地方制宜之措置」云云。</p>

<p>，以供市民游憇之所一案，今日下午</p>
<p>大會第七次會議中，將由參議員多人</p>
<p>提請付諸討論。記者爲此事特走訪某</p>
<p>法律專家，徵詢其對於征用該園改爲</p>
<p>公園法律上有無根據，承其答復如下</p>
<p>：（問）私人花園能否征用。（答）</p>
<p>國家因公用事業及公共衛生　其他由</p>
<p>政府與辦以公共利益為目的之事眾</p>
<p>依土地法第二○八條第三，第四，第</p>
<p>九各款之規定，得征收私有土地。（</p>
<p>問）征收之地價法律上應如何規定。</p>
<p>（答）已依法規定地價者，依法定地</p>
<p>價，土地法第二三九條各款規定甚篇</p>
<p>明白。（問）現時該愛　園法定地價</p>
<p>爲若干。（答）本　萬一畝。</p>
<h3>愛儷園　捐地建造圖書館　房產一時無法出售建築經費尚成問題</h3>
<p>「本報訊」頃據哈同洋行發言人語記者稱：</p>
<p>上次市參議會曾有決議案，擬租借愛　圖開關</p>
<p>爲公園，當時經遣產繼承人婉言拒絕，嗣後迭</p>
<p>次與市府商談結果，哈同洋行有意將愛　園沿</p>
<p>福煦路之基地十五畝捐戲市府，並在該地基上建造圖書館，經費</p>
<p>將在慈善基金內撥付，蓋哈同夫人羅迦陸逝世時，會指定小花園</p>
<p>慈德里。慈和里二處房地產約廿</p>
<p>畝作為慈善事業基金，俟該二處</p>
<p>房地產出售後，始可將所得價款</p>
<p>之一部份動工興建岡書館。惟自</p>
<p>勝利復員以來，哈同洋行所有之</p>
<p>全部房地產即被停止辦理登記，</p>
<p>過戶，換發權利書狀等手續，迄</p>
<p>今仍在凍結狀態中，故無法出售</p>
<p>。尙有南京路五福弄地產約二畝</p>
<p>七分餘，亦撥捐獻中國政府。又</p>
<p>謂：目前哈同洋行經濟十分拮据</p>
<p>，房租僅按戰前金額三千二百四</p>
<p>十倍收取，而捐稅繁多，負担甚</p>
<p>重，繩迦陵夫人義子義女遺產繼</p>
<p>承人，多至二十餘戶，皆依此爲</p>
<p>生，且尙有民國二十四年間爲究</p>
<p>納英國政府遺產稅而所負之債務</p>
<p>，當時値法帶二千數百萬元，此</p>
<p>巨大債務至今未了，言下表示不</p>
<p>勝感慨。</p>

<h3>寗波需要新建設</h3>
<p>「本報寗波廿七日訊」寗波是浙江最大的商埠，也是東南沿海一個最大的呑吐口；每天有海</p>
<p>輪和上海往來，把海產的魚鮮，土產的笋，漆，和竹器等運銷出去，帶回各種工　製成品。它</p>
<p>是最初和西人通商的五口之一，有百餘年的商業歷史，人口達七十多萬。在工業方面，也有很</p>
<p>好的輕工業基礎，有紡紗，麵粉，　頭等大小三，四十家工廠，供應浙東各地的民生日用品。</p>
<p>抗戰以後，元氣雖然减了不少，人口祇剩了五十餘萬，往來上海寗波間的海輪從七絏减到三艘</p>
<p>，顯明地表示了商業的衰頽；工業方面，就拿寗波最大的和豊紗廠來說：錠子從戰前的二萬六</p>
<p>千枚减到現在的六千枚，祇用四百個工人，每大出十四件二十支的粗紗，銷經溫，合一帶去織</p>
<p>土布。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但在工商業普遍蕭</p>
<p>條的現狀下，舞波畢竟還是一個</p>
<p>有生氣的商業城市，而且地方當</p>
<p>局亦頗致力於城市的欣欣向榮，</p>
<p>今年春天，記者過兩去溪口的時</p>
<p>候，寗波還顯得很破敗，表面上</p>
<p>看不出復元的成續來；而半年之</p>
<p>後的今日，記者重到寗波，第</p>
<p>一個新的印象就是通路大半修平</p>
<p>了，</p>
<p>重要幹道</p>
<p>都重鋪了柏油</p>
<p>，東街路兩旁</p>
<p>還植了梧桐，那樣子就比上海的</p>
<p>飛路還要氣魄大些。他們所以</p>
<p>能够這樣大規模的修，是因爲沿</p>
<p>路的店家都願意捐數十萬元出來</p>
<p>做經費。這在杭州，就很難辦到</p>
<p>；從此我們也可看出寗波人的經</p>
<p>濟狀况是比較好的。而且寗波還</p>
<p>有公娼，後市。蒼水街一帶的妓</p>
<p>院營業比戰前好，旅館裏，茶館</p>
<p>裏，茶房總備有一頭，二等的「</p>
<p>名花」表，電話出差，非常便當</p>
<p>。巨商豪富，擺一桌花酒，一來</p>
<p>就是三百萬，毫無吝色—寗彼</p>
<p>，你能說它不景氣嗎？</p>
<p>但是撕開這層豪華的裝飾，我</p>
<p>們來看看它底內層，却也無法藥</p>
<p>觀，一個寗波的同業吿訴我，戰</p>
<p>前寗波的商店都有很多的存貨儲</p>
<p>藏在堆棧中，現在都祗能裝飾裝</p>
<p>飾店面了，有些迎橱窗都裝不滿</p>
<p>呢！這就說明了商人內裏的空虛</p>
<p>。有一位縣參議員在參議會裏大</p>
<p>聲疾呼的說：「今天公務員罷工</p>
<p>，明天糞夫搗亂，這正表明了社</p>
<p>會的浮動不安」！而這，也正表</p>
<p>明了一般市民的經濟生活的困苦</p>
<p>，陳佑華縣長曾很愼重地對記者</p>
<p>說；「寗波的民性樸實無華，勤</p>
<p>儉耐勞」。這固然是寗波人起家</p>
<p>的「法寳」，亦是寗波市上娛樂</p>
<p>塲所稀少，街上找不到咖啡店，</p>
<p>茶館的原因之一；但經濟的因素</p>
<p>，恐怕也是重要的原因哩。而寗</p>
<p>波乞丐之多，也正表明了社會經</p>
<p>濟的不景氣。</p>
<p>漁業中心</p>
<p>寗波的漁市，是儼然成為全省</p>
<p>的。浙江漁區</p>
<p>的四大產品—</p>
<p>大，小黃魚，烏賊和帶魚，—及</p>
<p>其他海產，都是以寗波和沈家門</p>
<p>爲集中地的。在寗波，百分之七</p>
<p>十的漁產是運到上海再轉銷大江</p>
<p>南北各地；百分之十由內河運往</p>
<p>餘姚，紹與，而百分之二十留本</p>
<p>埠供應市民。除了漁產，寗波的</p>
<p>糧食本來也是出口的。但記者到</p>
<p>寗波時，剛頒布了禁令，因爲今</p>
<p>秋畢，虫成災，據縣府統計，各</p>
<p>鄉晚稻的損失量，數達百分之七</p>
<p>十，多至百分之九十。因此除了</p>
<p>缺糧的鄰縣特別通融外，一槪禁</p>
<p>止了。不過泰豐麵粉廠日產麵粉</p>
<p>百包，在華北交通未便，商運阻</p>
<p>梗的狀態下，都大量的運銷上海</p>
<p>去了，這是戰後始有的現象。</p>
<p>說到公用事業，寗波人是常常</p>
<p>引以自豪的。事實上確實也辦得</p>
<p>不錯，譬如說，寗波電力很足，</p>
<p>電話很靈，雖是人工接綫的，但</p>
<p>比上海的自動電話還要靈快，很</p>
<p>爽氣。祗是飲水始終太糟，終</p>
<p>是鹹的。不久，將試辦市區公共</p>
<p>汽車由鄞穿公司試辦江東至西郊</p>
<p>一段；貫通江東和江北兩區的新</p>
<p>江橋，也正設法興修加固，我深</p>
<p>深地希望寗波人更積極地發揮他</p>
<p>們傳統的「勤儉克苦」的精神，</p>
<p>把寗波向更現代化的路上推去。</p>
<p>因爲寗彼沒有房荒，住屋不用項</p>
<p>費，租金也比杭州低，店屋的頂</p>
<p>費最多不過數千萬；而市區治安</p>
<p>甚佳，是一個可以</p>
<p>安居樂業</p>
<p>的地方，有</p>
<p>一部份地方士</p>
<p>紳很想開發東區的東錢湖，把一</p>
<p>個鄕村姑娘裝飾得麼登樣兒，傳</p>
<p>能與杭州的西子爭姸，以繁榮市</p>
<p>面。其實，我覺得一個城市應有</p>
<p>其自已底特色，百餘年來，寗波</p>
<p>已有相當的工商業基礎，將來杭</p>
<p>永鐵路築成、扈杭甬鐵路全部灰</p>
<p>復，地處海陸交通要紐，其繁榮</p>
<p>固指日可得，何勞去建設離城太</p>
<p>遠的風景區？目前應該注意的，</p>
<p>倒在學術文化方面，不要使將來</p>
<p>的寗波有太多的銅臭氣，而在精</p>
<p>神生活方面，顯得空虛。博物</p>
<p>館，岡書館都已毀壊無存；名滿</p>
<p>天下的「天一閣」，亦空有珍本</p>
<p>書籍，藏而不用；高工，浙東，</p>
<p>正始等中等專校校舍損毀，至今</p>
<p>未能恢復；在在都表明文化方面</p>
<p>需要大建設。而這種需要，是和</p>
<p>修路，闢公共汽軍同樣的重要的</p>
<p>。（記者黃行天）</p>

<h3>中國腸衣工業概況　工商輔導處調査</h3>
<p>一　槪述</p>
<p>中國腸衣輸出，遠在遜淸末葉。初</p>
<p>由俄人在華北天津一帶收買，運鎖國</p>
<p>外。德人繼而採辦，分別在滬漢等埠</p>
<p>設立工塲，加工醃製。嗣後採購範圍</p>
<p>日廣，銷路亦日見擴充，英美法等各</p>
<p>國商人亦接踵而起。國人遂兢相仿製</p>
<p>，自設工塲，一時頗呈蓬勃氣象。惟</p>
<p>富時國人對於輸出業務不見諳熟，又</p>
<p>以難獲國外對手，故製成之腸衣，均</p>
<p>轉售於外商洋行。價款以國內通用貨</p>
<p>幣交付，原無易取外匯可言。自國內</p>
<p>經營直接輸出之公司行號設立後，腸</p>
<p>衣對外貿易，始漸形重要，而外商之</p>
<p>經營腸衣　務者逐漸減少，近則僅佔</p>
<p>十分之一二而已。</p>
<p>二　腸衣種類</p>
<p>賜衣可分猪腸，牛腸，羊腸三種。</p>
<p>猪羊腸衣用鹽醃製後，裝入木桶出口</p>
<p>。牛陽衣則須晒乾後，用胡椒粉洒裝</p>
<p>於附有鉛皮之木箱內出口。牛羊腸衣</p>
<p>出產數量不多，猪腸衣較爲遍警，佔</p>
<p>腸衣出口之大宗。通常所　腸，多指</p>
<p>猪腸衣而言。猪腸衣之集中醃製及出</p>
<p>口地區，爲上海，漢口，重慶，天津</p>
<p>，靑島，烟台等埠。</p>
<p>三　猪暘之品質</p>
<p>猪腸以花色小者爲優，（花色即圓</p>
<p>徑）按尺碼標準，普通分爲大種。自</p>
<p>二十四粍起至三十六粍止，以二十四</p>
<p>耗至三十四粍爲小條，三十四耗至三</p>
<p>十六粍以上爲大條。小條爲上等花色</p>
<p>，大條爲下等花色。又品質與顏色亦</p>
<p>有關係，品質以無破爛者爲隹，顏色</p>
<p>以帶二紅色者爲最優，淡紅與粉白色</p>
<p>者次之，黃色黑色者爲長劣。上海四</p>
<p>郊，及京滬滬杭沿綫，皖南等各城鎭</p>
<p>所產之猪腸，品質甚佳，皮薄而凈，</p>
<p>口徑勻而細小，除色澤不及美國腸衣</p>
<p>自嫩外，其他方面，均爲世界各國所</p>
<p>稱羡。產自湘豫郡等省區之腸衣，大</p>
<p>都皮厚兼有花筋，東慶方面所產者，</p>
<p>均爲厚皮及有粗大花筋，品質較遜。</p>
<p>四　加工廠數</p>
<p>上海醃製腸衣工廠及腸衣作，已加</p>
<p>入同業公會者，計五十九家。就中腸</p>
<p>衣作佔四十一家，工廠佔十八家，內</p>
<p>有外商經營者五家。又工廠經營出口</p>
<p>業務者十一家，每廠工人，多者二十</p>
<p>餘人，少者十餘人。腸衣作工人每單</p>
<p>位約三四人，各廠及腸衣作工人人數</p>
<p>，常視加工旺淡而有增减。</p>
<p>五　加工數量</p>
<p>二十五年醃製腸衣約一萬桶，三十</p>
<p>五年約二千桶，三十六年上半年約一</p>
<p>千五百桶。</p>
<p>六　加工程序</p>
<p>上梅出口之豬腸，可分鹽乾兩種。</p>
<p>其來源可分鮮貨與毛貨兩種。茲分別</p>
<p>說明之，上海人口稠密，肉類之供求</p>
<p>，以猪肉爲大宗，每日各屠宰殺之猪</p>
<p>，其猪腸四分之三資與腸廠，以供製</p>
<p>迭腸衣。鮮腸入廠後，浸入水中，經</p>
<p>二十四小時取出，用畏方形之竹片刮</p>
<p>摩之。除去脂肪及其他夾雜物質，再</p>
<p>以淸水冲洗數次，使內外潔凈，然後</p>
<p>復浸入缸中，約歷二十四小時，直至</p>
<p>腸衣呈乳色或稍帶漢紅色時取出，漂</p>
<p>白晒乾，量其長度及其口徑，分別紮</p>
<p>裝。</p>
<p>鹽腸衣之長度，每副爲十三碼半，</p>
<p>至多不超過三條，紮在一起，和以精</p>
<p>鹽，至翌日用手結成一紮，放於平底</p>
<p>之竹籃中，各籃可容二百紮，將竹籃</p>
<p>堆起重壓之，使水分减少，易於裝桶</p>
<p>。每桶裝二五〇〇副，或一二五〇副</p>
<p>，而每　腸衣均加　精鹽，或更加入</p>
<p>鹽　，然後將桶加蓋釘牢，完成裝桶</p>
<p>手續。</p>
<p>毛貨之製法與鮮貨大同小異，惟由</p>
<p>各地如江蘇之如皋。泰興。南京。鎭</p>
<p>江。蘇州。常州。浙江之溫州。杭州</p>
<p>。蘭溪。紹興。安徽之蕪湖。蚌埠。</p>
<p>合肥。安慶。江西之九江。四川之重</p>
<p>慶裝運來滬之前，所用之監較劣，貨</p>
<p>組而帶黑色，問有攙入明　，以致腸</p>
<p>衣變色，不大爲腸衣商所歡迎。故運</p>
<p>滬後，仍須加工製造，方可裝桶出</p>
<p>口。</p>
<p>乾腸之製法與鹽腸相似，惟不用鹽</p>
<p>，刮凈漂白後，即行晒乾，然後壓扁</p>
<p>，分別長度口徑，裝入木箱，以備輸</p>
<p>出。</p>
<p>牛腸亦可分鹽乾兩種，先將牛之小</p>
<p>腸大腸漫於淸水中，約二十四小時，</p>
<p>然後洗刮，盡除脂肪，及其他組織，</p>
<p>再以淸水冲洗潔凈，然後沒入多量之</p>
<p>淸水中，越日再行刮洗，將腸衣吹賬</p>
<p>，以檢察有無穿破之處，見有破損者</p>
<p>，即予淘汰，將完好者晒乾後，用胡</p>
<p>椒數洒壓扁，每副約長二十米達，十</p>
<p>副成一紮，裝入鉛皮木箱中，每箱約</p>
<p>二十紮，鹽牛腸之製法，與鹽豬腸相</p>
<p>同。</p>
<p>羊腸衣祗用監製，其製法與鹽猪腸</p>
<p>相似，其包裝情形，每桶五○○把，</p>
<p>每把三副，每副至多六條，其長度約</p>
<p>三十四碼。</p>
<p>七　輸出數量</p>
<p>戰前腸衣每年輸出總數量，約一萬</p>
<p>桶左右，由上海輸出者約四千五百桶</p>
<p>，漢口重廢輸出者約三千五百桶，天</p>
<p>津靑島輸出者約共二千桶，其國外市</p>
<p>場分配情形如左：</p>
<p>北歐各國（包括德。荷。比。</p>
<p>彼。匈。捷。丹。挪。瑞。瑞士等</p>
<p>）年約六千桶，</p>
<p>２　地中海沿岸各國（包括法。義</p>
<p>。西及巴爾幹各國）年約一千五百桶</p>
<p>３　英國及其屬地（包括南菲）年</p>
<p>約五百桶，</p>
<p>４　美國年約二千桶。</p>
<p>勝利後至三十五年底止，全國　出</p>
<p>總數約計二千桶，內百分之六十均為</p>
<p>戰前存貨，百分之四十係於勝利後向</p>
<p>各地搜　加工製造者，就中　往美國</p>
<p>者約一千三百桶，運往歐洲者約七百</p>
<p>桶。</p>
<p>八　目前困離</p>
<p>三十四年秋季勝利以後，國外售價</p>
<p>，原甚低落，惟尙能勉敷成本。本年</p>
<p>度因外滙匯率關係，輸出一桶，　累</p>
<p>最高會　百分之四十。近以華南走私</p>
<p>猖獗，素無腸衣出口之香港，今亦隱</p>
<p>爲腸衣出口之中心，因之國外售價更</p>
<p>一落千丈。如美國方面本年春季每把</p>
<p>（每把兩副計長二十七碼）售價約美</p>
<p>金九角，今竟低至三角三分。瑞士方</p>
<p>面亦自每副一元八角餘之瑞士法郎，</p>
<p>逐跌至七角餘，影響　出亟钜。至成</p>
<p>本方面，因鹽稅增加，每桶增加成本</p>
<p>約七十餘萬元，其他各項開支，亦以</p>
<p>一般工價物價高漲，均見增加，出口</p>
<p>愈見困難。又目前猪腸價格，向以猪</p>
<p>肉爲價準。往年腸衣之收價，每副（</p>
<p>長十三　半）約當於鮮肉一斤之市價</p>
<p>，鄕郊肉價比較通商都會爲低，猪腸</p>
<p>價格自　較賤，因之鄕人均樂予收購</p>
<p>。鮮腸販運於都會，售與腸廠醃製出</p>
<p>口，今則肉價已高一萬數千元，而鮮</p>
<p>腸每副之價格，尙不及五千元，且因</p>
<p>運輸等種種困難，鄕人皆不願販運，</p>
<p>或在當地售作肥料，或以之充作食料</p>
<p>。倘不提高收購價格，則腸廠加工數</p>
<p>量無法增加，且至日形減少矣。</p>

<h3>論醫學人才</h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>目前最流行的一句話，說：「腐體殺人」，「見死不救</p>
<p>」。但，平心靜氣的思索一下，我們的醫院確實是對「救人</p>
<p>」工作是沒有效率，實際上，整個國家都感科學醫人才缺乏</p>
<p>，這不僅是醫院單方面的問題，而是國家常前的一個嚴重問</p>
<p>題。</p>
<p>我們爲什麽會感到科學醫的人</p>
<p>才缺乏呢？此中因果很多，一言</p>
<p>難盡，但最根本的，是醫政，醫</p>
<p>敎沒有上軌道，同時，社會上更</p>
<p>沒有形成培養科學醫人才的環境</p>
<p>，就因為這，多少天才不能一日</p>
<p>千里，多少公醫不能施展懷抱，</p>
<p>多少有用的醫生，廢棄於無用之</p>
<p>地，這個因素若不改變，則民族</p>
<p>健康無由改造，公醫事業亦無法</p>
<p>推進，科學醫的前途，也絕對沒</p>
<p>有希望，因此，科學醫人才增加</p>
<p>，實在是國家盛衰，民族健康的</p>
<p>根本問題，我們必須予以澈底的</p>
<p>探討和客觀的硏究，我們知道，</p>
<p>事業的發展與人才有關，而人才</p>
<p>多半又是培養成功的，國際培植</p>
<p>有方，人才當然輩出，提携以時</p>
<p>，故俊傑蔚起，孔子日，「十室</p>
<p>之邑，必有忠信」，今日我國科</p>
<p>學醫的消沉，並非無人材，而實</p>
<p>爲人才未得其用。　總理曾云，</p>
<p>「人盡其才」，並云及「培養有</p>
<p>道則天無枉生之才，鼓勵以方，</p>
<p>則野無抑　之士，任使得法，則</p>
<p>朝無　進之徒」，這眞是千古良</p>
<p>言，治世良方，可惜，現我醫界</p>
<p>都重偶像，資歷，而輕視才能，</p>
<p>致英俊之才多被埋沒，這就是培</p>
<p>養未盡其道，自醫藥商業化後，</p>
<p>重奔　營，忽視機能，致醫德倫</p>
<p>亡，醫療作風亦日趨墮落，這就</p>
<p>是鼓勵無方，再說罷，醫界同仁</p>
<p>，多重私情派系，致力量常相對</p>
<p>消，這就是任使不得其法，像這</p>
<p>樣的醫政醫敎，怎談得上培養有</p>
<p>道？</p>
<p>談到我們的衛生行政，皆重</p>
<p>私情而　大義，或成同鄉同學的</p>
<p>集團，進退以私，舉措皆誤，像</p>
<p>這樣的唯知派系，不問賢愚，致</p>
<p>使有志於公醫者，皆懷五日京兆</p>
<p>之心，結果，醫者皆無盡忠職守</p>
<p>之志。於是，在公醫機關服務者</p>
<p>，僅爲解決生活。而對病者則毫</p>
<p>無休戚之感，加以各人利害衝突</p>
<p>。學校系統的鬥爭，環境牽掣，</p>
<p>彼此攻擊，結果，禍延病胞。這</p>
<p>種分崩離析的局面，形成社會人</p>
<p>士指責，千夫所指皆日科學醫爲</p>
<p>庸醫，公立醫院爲殺人屠塲，譽</p>
<p>論批評，怨聲載道。像這樣的慘</p>
<p>痛敎訓，實不忍言，若我醫界人</p>
<p>士再不改弦易轍，則公醫事業勢</p>
<p>必同歸於盡。</p>
<p>現在的趨勢皆為金錢所左右</p>
<p>，致高尚的仁心仁術的醫，亦不</p>
<p>得不奔競鑽營。阿諛奉承，推諉</p>
<p>卸責，奴顏　膝，脅肩　笑，這</p>
<p>也就是我們醫藥官僚化所造成的</p>
<p>積極，亦為我科學醫的害群之馬</p>
<p>，科學醫界有此小人，必至服</p>
<p>務無熱誠，醫療必不能盡人意，</p>
<p>朦蔽病人爲能事，像這樣，對</p>
<p>公對私均十分危險，古語云，君</p>
<p>子小人，物以類聚，若我醫界今</p>
<p>後仍重奔競　營，喜逢迎阿諛，</p>
<p>則良醫公醫，必將明哲以保身，</p>
<p>而貪墨庸醫者流，則必將　　而</p>
<p>倖進，像這樣，我國科學醫根本</p>
<p>不會有希望，因此，我們應鳴鼓</p>
<p>而攻之。</p>
<p>我們知道，崇拜偶像，重視</p>
<p>資歷，在承平盛世，食油其本身</p>
<p>之價值：但，在此，　亂建國之</p>
<p>初，則似乎不可過於重視，今日</p>
<p>何日？乃國家多事之秋，民族健</p>
<p>康低落之日，若公立醫療，徒擁</p>
<p>虛名，不能綜　名實，爲民謀福</p>
<p>，則天下後世，永爲民族罪人。</p>
<p>我國自有衛生機構以來，自中樞</p>
<p>至省市各衛生達官顯貴，對於衛</p>
<p>政好壞，各有千秋，所可惜者，</p>
<p>即我國自經歷史上的抗戰，而衛</p>
<p>生，醫藥，具未能陶籌新進傑出</p>
<p>的人才，是不是真的無良材，抑</p>
<p>當局未善加提拔而授以大任呢？</p>
<p>抗戰八載，各加衛生工作靑年，</p>
<p>轉瞬年逾不惑，內中恐有不少耿</p>
<p>耿精忠之士，妙手回春之材，茍</p>
<p>能利用其長，提攜以進，授以大</p>
<p>任，藉養其望，假以權力，以重</p>
<p>其威，則此中亦必有可以「遣大</p>

<h3>從生理衛生觀點談改良器皿蓋子百之</h3>
<p>— 百之</p>
<p>我們盛食物的碗盆罐　節杯</p>
<p>等種種器皿，爲什麽要有蓋子？</p>
<p>不消說，目的是保障食物的清靜</p>
<p>，阻止塵埃和種種不潔物的侵入</p>
<p>。但時代不同，智識開展，所謂</p>
<p>不潔物的觀念和種類，也跟着有</p>
<p>點變改。而前代所計設的種種蓋</p>
<p>子的式樣，在今日也跟着有點不</p>
<p>適實用，而有改良之必要。</p>
<p>現在先講不潔物的種類；盛</p>
<p>在樽碗等器中之食物上，所能侵</p>
<p>入的不潔物照從前時代人們的心</p>
<p>目中所有，不過是　上落下的灰</p>
<p>塵，大風吹來的灰沙，至於</p>
<p>的聚食，並不以為不潔。一揮手</p>
<p>把蠅蚋趕走，照樣把這食物拿起</p>
<p>來，裝入口腔裏，嚥下肚子裏，</p>
<p>不算什麽一回事。現在可不行了</p>
<p>，知道　　有攜帶傷寒霍亂痢疾</p>
<p>等種種病菌的危險。因爲蠅蚋最</p>
<p>喜歡逐　合　，傷寒病人的大小</p>
<p>便，霍亂病人的吐瀉物，痢疾病</p>
<p>人後門貨，都有狠豐富病菌，蠅</p>
<p>蚋狠喜歡在那裏開聚餐食，一到</p>
<p>那裏，他們的足上，翅膀和嘴邊</p>
<p>，就有許多病菌汙染着。他們帶</p>
<p>了許多病菌，飛翔來到筵席上，</p>
<p>好像轟炸機滿載了炸彈，飛翔來</p>
<p>到我們的頭上一樣。他所光降的</p>
<p>地點，就有許多病菌汙染這地點</p>
<p>，他走一步，汙染一步，走兩步</p>
<p>，汙染兩步，好像潘妃的步步金</p>
<p>蓮，印着芳蹤。若降落在飲食物</p>
<p>上，就汙染飲食物，爬在器皿上</p>
<p>，就汙染器皿，停在桌子上，就</p>
<p>汙染桌面。我常常堪見他們喜歡</p>
<p>降落到杯皿的口緣上，停了一停</p>
<p>，喜歡沿著日　，團團去兜一個</p>
<p>圈子。好像守城的兵士，在城牆</p>
<p>上套圈子一樣。於是乎這隻杯皿</p>
<p>的口緣，就被他們汙染了。尤其</p>
<p>是蒼蠅，吃飽了穢物以後，翔集</p>
<p>於潔淨的地點，喜歡吐出一點穢</p>
<p>物，點　這潔淨的地點，夏季，</p>
<p>清白的衣服上，往往無端有了一</p>
<p>個汙點，這就是蒼蠅所吐出的汙</p>
<p>物。古人只曉得蠅能够點汙潔白</p>
<p>，而對於飲食，從來沒有說蒼蠅</p>
<p>點　的話。所以　　能夠造成飲</p>
<p>食物的不潔，是古人腦中所沒有</p>
<p>注意的。</p>
<p>還有感胃病人的口鼻分泌物</p>
<p>，結核病人的痰，尤其是喉頭結</p>
<p>核病人的痰，都有許多病原菌涵</p>
<p>泳其中。一經咳漱　唾，就隨著</p>
<p>細微水滴，飛揚空中，落到飲食</p>
<p>物上，和杯皿卓十上，也會汙染</p>
<p>飲食物和杯皿和桌面。這種不潔</p>
<p>物，也是古人腦子裏所沒有注意</p>
<p>的。</p>
<p>現在我把盛食物的器皿的蓋</p>
<p>日常所容易看見的用岡來表示一</p>
<p>二再加以批評，其他可以例推。</p>
<p>圖上所畫的這種蓋子，</p>
<p>最是普通，盛飯盛小菜的碗蓋，</p>
<p>都是這樣。這是最不合理想的蓋</p>
<p>。牠把碗的口緣，露出在外面。</p>
<p>什麼不潔物，都狠容易汙染着。</p>
<p>不論灰塵風沙蠅蚋，和嚏咳的飛</p>
<p>沫，都可落下。而且這種蓋子，</p>
<p>他的背，却穹窿起來，倘若有流</p>
<p>質的不潔物，落下到蓋背上，或</p>
<p>碗口內緣，就可以直接流入碗中</p>
<p>，汙染飲食物。即使把流質不潔</p>
<p>物除外不講，而被蒼蠅　咳等所</p>
<p>汙染在碗口　的不潔物，在蓋子</p>
<p>揭開的時候，不潔物也會落到碗</p>
<p>裏去。假如碗裏面盛了羹湯等等</p>
<p>流質的飲料，端起來或用獎匙去</p>
<p>挽牠的時候，流質動　起來，也</p>
<p>要逆上到　　的區域，而被　染</p>
<p>。幷且我們往往把嘴湊在碗的口</p>
<p>碗口緣的　染區域，到人的嘴裡</p>
<p>去，不潔物就跟著侵入我們身體</p>
<p>腸去了。</p>
<p>這種蓋子，常常在茶杯上</p>
<p>看見，比第一稱好得多。不潔物</p>
<p>不會汚染到杯的口緣去，也不會</p>
<p>直接侵入到杯裏面去。用我們的</p>
<p>嘴湊在杯的口綠去飲茶，亦沒有</p>
<p>什麼危險。但是有一件很要注意</p>
<p>的事！就是這種蓋子，揭起來的</p>
<p>時候，不可隨便把蓋子放在桌面</p>
<p>上，必須翻轉來，把蓋的背面接</p>
<p>觸到桌面上，敎牠仰腹而臥。因</p>
<p>爲桌面上，是難保沒有不潔物汚</p>
<p>染着，若不把蓋子翻轉來放在桌</p>
<p>上，那末蓋子的腹面，就接觸桌</p>
<p>面，就有汚染的可能。軍新再去</p>
<p>蓋上杯子的時候，就會汚染到杯</p>
<p>的口緣，和杯中的飲料。</p>
<p>這種蓋子最好，外面的不</p>
<p>潔物，旣不會侵入皿綠和皿裏的</p>
<p>飲食物，而揭開來，可以任意放</p>
<p>在桌上。即使蓋的口緣被桌面上</p>
<p>不潔物汚染了，好在牠是罩在皿</p>
<p>的外面，不會傳播到皿的內面去</p>
<p>，我們用做純粹培養細菌的培養</p>
<p>皿，就是採用這種方式。我以爲</p>
<p>各種盛飲食物的器皿，最好一律</p>
<p>採用這個方式，　幾乎飲食物的</p>
<p>到安全清潔的保障。尤其是夏秋</p>
<p>之交，霍亂痢疾及其他急性胃腸</p>
<p>病流行的時候，很要當心。</p>
<h3>讀醫雜記　（一）色盲者的新用途</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>我們醫師替人檢査體格的時候，總要檢定那人有沒有色盲症。如果有色盲症呢</p>
<p>那末這種色盲者多半是不會錄取的了，因爲色盲者不能鑑別紅色與綠色，這對於</p>
<p>公事方面往往可以發生許多麻煩的。至於關係父通管理方面呢，那些色盲者更是</p>
<p>要不得的了。可是在這第二次的世界大戰中美國的軍部居然大事徵求這批色盲者</p>
<p>，而且都把他們安插在飛機方面。這眞是一種奇聞怪事。但是說穿了一點不奇，</p>
<p>因爲那批色盲者雖然不能區別紅色和綠色，可是他們對於天然的顏色和僞裝的顏</p>
<p>色，具有强度的鑑別力，無論是一種城市或軍事要地，只要有僞裝的設施，他們</p>
<p>馬上就可以辨別出來。德國的城市僞裝術非常巧妙，英美的飛機師常常受愚，可</p>
<p>是自從僱用色盲者之後，馬上就可以區別出偽裝地帶，結果德國的城市因此就大</p>
<p>大地被摧毀了。現在的世界雖然不能說是和平抑或有戰爭，可是色盲者暫時只有</p>
<p>失業了。</p>
<p>不過，因爲色盲者是善於鑑別色素的層次的</p>
<p>，也許他們將來也可以發展他們的鑑別力去鑑別</p>
<p>古畫的眞假吧。</p>
<p>磺　胺劑治療沙眼新法。</p>
<p>我們老早都曉得沙眼可以內服消治能片，或</p>
<p>其他　　胺劑，有許多雜誌老早就報告過牠的許</p>
<p>多功效。可是因爲它的毒性太大，不但刺激腸胃</p>
<p>而且也破壞紅血球太厲害，所以有許多醫師總是</p>
<p>猶豫不敢試用。有些醫師想把磺　胺劑做成油膏</p>
<p>直接敷在沙眼患處，可是因它的刺激性太大，往</p>
<p>往痛楚非凡，而且往往也會使兩眼皮浮腫起來，</p>
<p>所以眼科醫師們也不敢用牠。現在經過多次的研</p>
<p>究之後，知道用百分之十二的磺　胺油膏可以减</p>
<p>少許多刺激。假使在敷用此種藥膏之前先用百分</p>
<p>之三的硼酸水洗滌患處，那末就更加無碍了。</p>
<h3>百日咳之重要性及其療法</h3>
<p>— 壽梧靑</p>
<p>目下咳嗽盛行，里弄小孩，患者甚多，內中除傷風感冒</p>
<p>而外，百日咳患者，不在少數。按百日咳或　　　咳，因其</p>
<p>咳時，必有黏　濃厚之痰液，一似　　（家鳥名）之口涎，</p>
<p>由口腔吐出。或名天哮咳，因其咳嗽頻劇時上氣不接下氣，</p>
<p>向天伸頸，作深長之呼吸，以解其沉嗽喘息時之困扼。</p>
<p>百日咳爲小兒傳染病之一，</p>
<p>未感染之成人，亦易息之。學校</p>
<p>，團體，托兒所，影戲館，公園</p>
<p>，里巷，均爲本病傳染之場合，</p>
<p>而家庭之間，尤為本病密切之交</p>
<p>換所。故一家之內，恒有兄弟姊</p>
<p>妹三四人，同時患病者，咳聲如</p>
<p>雷，珠聯不絕，且病期頗久，擾</p>
<p>人淸夢，　爲父母所厭忌。</p>
<p>百日咳富有傳染性，其病源</p>
<p>爲百日咳桿菌，由咳嗽時噴射而</p>
<p>出之痰沫所傳染。患病小兒與健</p>
<p>康小兒，相距四尺周圍，概有傳</p>
<p>染之可能。自病菌侵入至發病初</p>
<p>期，約爲一二禮拜之久，其病狀</p>
<p>可分為三期。</p>
<p>第一期，小兒有咳嗽如傷風</p>
<p>，喉紅，鼻流泗，微熟或無熱，</p>
<p>，胃口如常，全身無特別徵狀，</p>
<p>爲期約二禮拜。（未完）</p>

<h3>沙漠動物的習性</h3>
<p>— 觀潮</p>
<p>沙漢原是不毛之地，旣少水源，又無樹木，僅有稀疎的</p>
<p>灌木或野草來點經這平沙千里，一望無際的境界。那末動物</p>
<p>旣然需要水分，亦需要食料，沙漠當然不是動物生活的適當</p>
<p>地方，換言之，動物很難生活於沙漢區域。可是實際上沙漠</p>
<p>裏的動物，並不如我們所想像的那麼單純，那麽稀少。</p>
<p>要解釋這種事實，我們試從</p>
<p>沙漠植物的一般性質說起。沙漢</p>
<p>植物的特殊之點有二：凡生長於</p>
<p>沙漢的植物，大概莖幹非常矮小</p>
<p>，葉面减少，甚至葉身整個地退</p>
<p>化，難以辨別，最普通的成爲針</p>
<p>刺，如仙人掌類的多刺，就是很</p>
<p>好例子。這種特別性狀，當然是</p>
<p>因土內水分缺乏而植物要减少蒸</p>
<p>發量的結果。除此以後，我們尤</p>
<p>須注意沙漢植物的特殊分佈。一</p>
<p>切沙漠植物，決不像草原區域那</p>
<p>樣綠草成萬，也不像森林區域那</p>
<p>樣枝葉蓬　，不見天日，在往彼</p>
<p>此散生於沙石之間，一若星羅棋</p>
<p>布。這樣寥落的分佈，不一定因</p>
<p>爲沙漠裏地下水分佈不勻的關係</p>
<p>，換言之，地面上植物所存在部</p>
<p>分，並不一定表示地下有水，反</p>
<p>言之，地面上沒有植物，並非表</p>
<p>示地下無水。我們要知道沙漠權</p>
<p>物的地上部分雖減返，但其根系</p>
<p>往往果常發達，在地下向各方伸</p>
<p>展，達到相當距離，以吸收水分</p>
<p>。好些灌木，在牠們植物體的組</p>
<p>織內，貯藏着多量水分，如仙人</p>
<p>掌科植物，貯水特別豐富。這些</p>
<p>貯水植物，就牠們本身來說，是</p>
<p>滿足生理的需要，可是人類或動</p>
<p>物，往往利肌爲沙漢裏唯一水源</p>
<p>除了這些貯水灌木之外，在</p>
<p>終年不雨或僅微雨或數年一兩的</p>
<p>沙漠地方，往往有主活極　的植</p>
<p>物。這些植物常雨水充足時，就</p>
<p>很快地生長出來，開花結實。在</p>
<p>短期內完成其生活史。當天乾時</p>
<p>，就會枯萎留下地下的部分，將</p>
<p>來一過下雨又能生長出來。這些</p>
<p>植物大概有肉質的葉子和肉質的</p>
<p>果實。因其壽命極短，生長極快</p>
<p>，所以不像那些灌木呈散生的情</p>
<p>况。</p>
<p>上述植物，有牠們適應特殊</p>
<p>環境的方法，所以生長相當良好</p>
<p>，分佈也相當豐富，是動物唯一</p>
<p>的食料和水的供給。還有若干動</p>
<p>物往往不必飲水，僅賴道些食料</p>
<p>內的水分和擬集在這些食料上的</p>
<p>露滴。那些嚙齒類紅頸鹿（Gaz</p>
<p>elle）或許多昆虫和其他無脊椎動</p>
<p>物，大概都是如此。</p>
<p>少數沙漠地方，常完全幹燥</p>
<p>，完全缺乏泉水或水穴，那稀有</p>
<p>的雨或僅小區域的雨，有時造成</p>
<p>暫時河流，但僅能維特數小時或</p>
<p>數日之久。有些大沙漠四面有高</p>
<p>山環繞，那河流的水往往能流到</p>
<p>相當距離，滲入沙中。這些滲入</p>
<p>沙內的水，祗有植物能够把她吸</p>
<p>上來，或由人　井取之，來供給</p>
<p>那些需要飲水的動物或需要多量</p>
<p>水分的動物。不過這些水源，並</p>
<p>不是長期和永久的，僅限於一個</p>
<p>時期。所以凡需要較多水分的動</p>
<p>物，必須有其特殊的適應習性，</p>
<p>始能存在。許多動物能够貯水於</p>
<p>體內，當有水源的時候，就飲多</p>
<p>量的水，可以維持相當的時日。</p>
<p>如我們習見的駱駝，能貯水於胃</p>
<p>的組織內，這是很好的例十。駱</p>
<p>在非洲阿拉伯和蒙古的沙漠裏</p>
<p>很普通，那蒙古種背有雙峯，其</p>
<p>他的僅有單峯。都是沙漢裏最主</p>
<p>要的運輸工具。有時牠們的主人</p>
<p>，還賴以供給乳水，充長期旅行</p>
<p>的食糧。此外許多爬蟲類生活於</p>
<p>沙漢中，也能貯藏水分於各器官</p>
<p>或體腔內。如加羅雷多（Colora</p>
<p>do）的沙漢裘有種烏龜，能生活</p>
<p>於極乾燥的地方，往往有時敵水</p>
<p>源六十哩處仍能存在的可說是她</p>
<p>能生活於他種動物所不能生活的</p>
<p>地方有些四脚蛇體內也能貯多量</p>
<p>的水分。土人常把牠們作飲料，</p>
<p>所以是乾燥地方的重要水源。還</p>
<p>有娃類勸物，普通的需要濕潤的</p>
<p>空氣和有水的棲所，因牠們的卵</p>
<p>和蝌蚪，須在水裏生長·不過有</p>
<p>種澳洲的穴蛙（Chiroleptes）和</p>
<p>普通的不同，能够貯水於體腔內</p>
<p>，掘穴而居，由蛙體發散的水分</p>
<p>，造成穴內的濕潤的空氣。土人</p>
<p>往往以比得到飲料。（未完）</p>

<h3>火箭的燃料</h3>
<p>— 愷</p>
<p>火箭的燃料，有兩大類：固</p>
<p>體燃料及液體燃料。前者不外一</p>
<p>般無烟火藥，不大容易控制，而</p>
<p>且需要極大的燃燒室；用於火箭</p>
<p>，頗不適宜。因此目下火箭燃料</p>
<p>的研究，都向液體燃料方面發展</p>
<p>。當然，大家認爲最理想的原動</p>
<p>力—原子能也是火箭最好的燃料</p>
<p>，不過距離實際應用尚嫌遙遠，</p>
<p>暫且按下不談。所以本文專介紹</p>
<p>些火箭的液體燃料。</p>
<p>在沒有談到正文以前，先說</p>
<p>什麽是火煎最適宜的燃料。我們</p>
<p>曉得火箭的運動是由於氣體以極</p>
<p>高的速度向後噴射而產生的反作</p>
<p>用。根據牛頓力學定律，火箭受</p>
<p>到的力：F　MC，M是單位時</p>
<p>間易噴出的氣體的質量，而C是</p>
<p>氣體噴出的速度。但是一個火箭</p>
<p>所帶的燃料有限，所以燃料的好</p>
<p>壞就決定於此燃料所發生的氣體</p>
<p>的噴射速度。同時我們更應知道</p>
<p>火箭的燃燒室溫度高達華氏六千</p>
<p>度。在這種高溫之下，許多情形</p>
<p>以及化學變化，都和平常大不相</p>
<p>同。許多知識，我們必須重新學</p>
<p>習。</p>
<p>舉個例說，在常溫時，液體</p>
<p>氣和汽油一同燃燒，比較液體氣</p>
<p>和酒精所能產生的效力大。但是</p>
<p>，在火箭燃燒室的高溫中，却是</p>
<p>相反。所以德國的V——2火箭，</p>
<p>就採用後面的兩種燃料了。</p>
<p>在高溫度時更有分解作用（</p>
<p>Dissociation）發生，這阻礙了</p>
<p>燃料的燃燒，燃燒不得充分，也</p>
<p>就影響了氣體的壓力以及噴射速</p>
<p>度，聲如酒精等含着氧，碳，氫</p>
<p>氣的化合物在華氏六千度時發生</p>
<p>氣體，依照計算及實騐的結果，</p>
<p>最高只有每秒八千呎的速度，道</p>
<p>速度當然不能滿足我們的要求。</p>
<p>針對着這現象，美國的科學家們</p>
<p>利用了有較高結合性的液體氫和</p>
<p>液體氧，果然，這使噴射速度增</p>
<p>加到每秒一萬二千呎，但又根據</p>
<p>普通化學的知識，我們知道氧和</p>
<p>氟有　項强大的結合力，他們在</p>
<p>暗處低溫也能迅速地合成氫氟酸</p>
<p>（HF），在高溫也不易分開，</p>
<p>科學家們想到了他，相信如果用</p>
<p>液體　和氣做燃料，一定可以得</p>
<p>到更好的結果，同時還有一個因</p>
<p>素，使液體的　和氫，比氣和氫</p>
<p>更適宜做火箭的燃料，這就是比</p>
<p>重。</p>
<p>火箭有　龐大的體積，其中</p>
<p>燃料佔有了四分之三，所以爲了</p>
<p>經濟地位，携帶比重較高的燃料</p>
<p>比較週宜，由這原則，我們計算</p>
<p>一下：</p>
<p>每一份氣要和氫二份合成一</p>
<p>份的水，而氧的原子量是一六氫</p>
<p>一，所以如用液體氫和液體　做</p>
<p>燃料，則携帶的氣重比氫重，應</p>
<p>爲入比一，同樣若用液體氟和液</p>
<p>體氫做燃料，則氟重比氫車是九</p>
<p>比一，大家都知道氣是最輕的，</p>
<p>因此液體氟和氫是較重的燃料，</p>
<p>也就是如用液體氟和液體氣作燃</p>
<p>料，可以使火箭的體積縮小不少</p>
<p>，這是我們最希望的。</p>
<p>不過，因難的地方是氟不大</p>
<p>容易析出，這需要克服，現在的</p>
<p>美國的科學家就正孜孜於研究這</p>
<p>個問題了。</p>
<h3>攀木魚和射水魚</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>在印度地方出產着這二種奇怪的魚——魚和射水</p>
<p>魚。</p>
<p>木魚的胸口生着一對堅硬的鰭，籍着這對鰭交錯的</p>
<p>運動起來，就能够以穩固的姿熊逐節逐節爬登上樹去。</p>
<p>這種魚不但能够在垂在水面上的樹幹問爬來爬去，就</p>
<p>是離水面相隔很遠的地方，也能够依靠着那一對變相的</p>
<p>涉行過去。</p>
<p>射水魚和　木魚的身體同樣大小，是一種淡水魚，牠</p>
<p>有一種氣力能使口同喉頭縮攏和脹開，尋常縮擺時口中含</p>
<p>滿了水，在岸邊巡游着，一見枝葉上有蒼蠅在逍遙自在地</p>
<p>作日光浴着，牠便立刻把嘴露出水面，念脹着口，將水噴</p>
<p>射上去。</p>
<p>牠的嘴就像一柄水　，乘人不備之時，猛的將水直射</p>
<p>過去，而牠的狙擊本領是種高强的，所以除非不給牠瞧見</p>
<p>，如給牠瞧見是沒有一個能倖免的。</p>
<p>射水魚的體形扁平，如同一隻小盤，頭部呈三角形·</p>
<p>牠具有敏銳的眼力。强大的狙擊力，有時能够把張在離水</p>
<p>面數尺高的蜘蛛網上的蜘蛛，也射落下來。</p>
<p>植物小品</p>
<h3>牽牛花</h3>
<p>— 加令</p>
<p>牽牛不是名花，又沒有誘人</p>
<p>的芬香，向來不受人們的重視。</p>
<p>但是如果細心觀賞，不難發見她</p>
<p>的美點——具有整齊美的喇叭花</p>
<p>冠，永遠左旋的藤蔓，體態極</p>
<p>巧，宋朝的詩人邵雍甚愛牽牛，</p>
<p>「主人凝佇看，長是廢朝眼。」</p>
<p>他秋天淸晨即起，欣賞　氣中帶</p>
<p>着露珠的牽牛花。</p>
<p>除風毒利小便</p>
<p>通稱牽牛爲喇叭花，其實萬</p>
<p>蘿，紫茉莉都具有喇叭花。爲什</p>
<p>麼被稱爲牽牛呢？據本草：「此</p>
<p>藥始出，田野人牽牛謝　，故以</p>
<p>名焉。」牽牛的種子具有用價</p>
<p>値，在中藥　作爲驅除風毒，利</p>
<p>導小便之用。</p>
<p>秋來難得花成染，閒引牽牛</p>
<p>上短</p>
<p>一根長而靭的藤蔓是牽牛的</p>
<p>特色，利用它可以做許多有趣的</p>
<p>玩意：把種子播在長形的炭　裏</p>
<p>，不久便　便全要，從不整齊的</p>
<p>簍中開出鮮美的花來，富有古</p>
<p>雅的風味。假使我們在地上種一</p>
<p>行牽牛，每株都用一根　讓它</p>
<p>援上來，不久便可長成一副天然</p>
<p>的鮮花彩簾。</p>
<p>爲什麽老是左旋</p>
<p>牽牛的藤永遠是左旋的，（</p>
<p>反時針方向）我們沒有方法可以</p>
<p>使它右旋。</p>
<p>牠的向左旋當然是因爲靠近</p>
<p>支持物接觸的一面生長較外面爲</p>
<p>遲緩的緣故。旣然有向左旋的牽</p>
<p>牛，那麽向右旋也有同樣的可能</p>
<p>性，爲什麼我們永遠找本到一株</p>
<p>右旋的呢？難道左旋比右旋好嗎</p>
<p>？那祗有造物者知曉了。</p>
<p>牽牛是單年生的植物，種子</p>
<p>落完後，莖葉漸漸枯槁，　在籬</p>
<p>笆上的藤也漸漸腐敗，脆裂而歸</p>
<p>於消減。所幸的，種子已經留下</p>
<p>，明年秋風曉霧中，又能舒展她</p>
<p>的美姿了。</p>

<h3>最有利的投資　科學研究</h3>
<p>— 尼甫</p>
<p>我們很容易猜想到像美國這樣一個工</p>
<p>業發達的國家，最有利的投資必定是在發</p>
<p>展工業；否則因爲牠是一個所調金元帝國</p>
<p>，開採金礦該是最有利了。事實上則不盡</p>
<p>然，在美國最有利的投資竟是在研究如何</p>
<p>得到更多的和優良的猪種，穀類或別的農</p>
<p>產品。據美國農業部農業研究委員會主席</p>
<p>蘭巴特博士（Dr·W·V·Lambrt）宣</p>
<p>佈：政府耗費在研究增進產品和改良品種</p>
<p>等等農業計劃方面的金錢，現在已經得到</p>
<p>了一百倍的報酬。</p>
<p>近幾十年來，用於很少幾個農業問題</p>
<p>的科學硏究費用，不過數千萬美元，而所</p>
<p>得的報償却將近二十五萬萬美元了。這裏</p>
<p>面尚不包括田地方面的收入。</p>
<p>茲將蘭巴特氏所宣稱關于農業硏究方</p>
<p>面的幾項記錄列舉如下：</p>
<p>雜交玉蜀黍（Hybrid　Com）——用去</p>
<p>一千萬美元的硏究費，經過了三十年的期</p>
<p>間，現在每年增加收入七萬五千美元。</p>
<p>DDT——僅耗去五萬美元硏究費。母</p>
<p>牛被施用DDT後可避免牛蠅的整刺，而</p>
<p>得到更精良的產品，因此每年可得到一千</p>
<p>萬美元的利益，這數字甚至於還要增到一</p>
<p>萬萬美元。</p>
<p>Phenothiazine——這種化學藥品可以</p>
<p>消減家畜體內的寄生蟲，所耗研究費用僅</p>
<p>一萬美元，而農夫却因家帝的飼料減少和</p>
<p>迅速成長，每年取回一千萬美元。</p>
<p>其他農業研究「每年的收益」包括硏</p>
<p>究各種穀類及糖之收成防腐的方法，每年</p>
<p>可因此收人十萬萬美元。再由於日漸經驗</p>
<p>所得的改進，每年可增加收入五萬萬美</p>
<p>元。</p>
<p>蘭巴特博士指出農業科學已經對人類</p>
<p>的生存貢獻極大，它曾找出如何大量生產</p>
<p>般尼西林（Peniclilin）的方法，而且正</p>
<p>向着如何供給人類營養的前途上邁進。</p>
<p>目前國際情勢，日益緊張。筆者以爲</p>
<p>如果美國釣科學家們，能以硏究原子能的</p>
<p>結果，使原子能成爲世界上一切動力的來</p>
<p>源，則其對美國本身的利益，對全世界人</p>
<p>類的幸福，當更千百倍超越農業科學硏究</p>
<p>的貢獻。可是若僅僅致力於戰減人類的原</p>
<p>子彈和毒菌的製造，則雖同時大量的生產</p>
<p>般尼西林，設法供給人類的營養，又有何</p>
<p>用？同爲科學研究，其關係人類的幸福及</p>
<p>禍害，僅繫於科學家一念之差。科學家們</p>
<p>，應知所從事矣！</p>
<p>末了，最有利的投資，在美國已證明</p>
<p>了是科學研究，我們中國的企業家該曉得</p>
<p>鑑了。</p>

<h3>National Army in Jiaodong Searches Mountain Areas, Recovers Baishui and Wendai in Shaanxi and Henan; Remnant Bandits Crossing Longhai Railway Continue to Flee</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in the county on the 29th] The focus of the Jiaodong war is still developing in the Juchiya Mountain area, 20 kilometers southeast of Qixia. After the National Army recovered the key points at the foot of the mountain, Tangjiabo, Liujiagou, and Shandongtou, they are now advancing fiercely towards the heart of the area in separate routes. In addition, two other attacking units of the National Army are currently continuing to advance from Qixia towards Yantai and from Huangxian towards Penglai. The resistance encountered by these two routes is minimal. The main purpose of the National Army is to discover landmines buried by the Communist bandits along the way and remove other obstacles. Therefore, the progress has not been as rapid as generally imagined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The National Army in Qixia, Jiaodong, is currently conducting a thorough search in the Juchiya Mountain area in the southeast, and has controlled all the key passes. It is reported that there are numerous small-scale armories of the Communist bandits in the area, which is known as the Jiaodong ammunition supply base.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 29th] The National Army in Jiaodong is approaching the suburbs of Qishan City and is engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in its southwest area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 29th] In the Henan-Hubei border area, the National Army advancing southward from Hengchuan defeated parts of the bandit's Second, Third, and Sixth Columns at Xiayagang (7 kilometers southeast of Chongchuan). The remnant bandits retreated to the east and west areas of Shuanglun River (15 kilometers southeast of Guangshan). The National Army is currently pursuing them victoriously.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] The bandits who had been entrenched in Baishui County suffered heavy casualties after days of fierce attacks by the National Army. They were finally attacked by the National Army and entered the city on the evening of the 27th, and the remnant bandits fled in all directions to the suburbs.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Our troops counterattacking along the railway from Tongguan launched an attack on the bandits with overwhelming force. The bandit army suffered heavy casualties and fled eastward in a panic. Our army recaptured Taodi Town on the afternoon of the 28th. In addition, the bandit army entrenched in Sanyaosi was also defeated and fled after our sweep. The commander of the bandit's 55th Division was killed in battle. Currently, there are no traces of bandits in the Weinan area. Detailed battle results are being investigated.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A unit of the Communist 12th Brigade, consisting of more than 2,000 bandits entrenched south of Tongguan, has been wiped out after days of cleaning up, with more than half of them killed or wounded. The remaining troops were unable to hold out and have been fleeing towards Dayukou (south of Gedizhen) since the 27th. We are pursuing them closely.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Kaifeng, 28th] Bandits from Yiyang and the ancient city of southern Shaanxi sneaked into the suburbs of Lushi last night, gathering more than 30,000 people, with unclear intentions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 29th] The Communist bandits lurking in Yichuan and Dengfeng fled in separate groups. Currently, there are no traces of bandits in Yichuan and Dengfeng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th] The Communist bandits who fled south across the Longhai Railway in western Shandong were divided into two groups on the morning of the 29th, one in the area southwest of Xiayi and the other between Qi County and Tongxu. A small number fled towards Taikang. Although these two groups of bandits have the numbers of four columns, their total number is only over 10,000, and they do not dare to make direct contact with the National Army. They only flee through gaps and disturb the local area, but they are suffering heavy losses due to the attacks of local militias everywhere.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Yanzhou, 29th] The main force of Chen Yi's remnant troops, consisting of eight columns, who had gathered in southwestern Shandong, with the exception of two columns that are still lingering in the central areas of Dingtao, Juye, Caoxian, and Shanxian counties, have all fled south across the Longhai Railway to the areas north of Yongcheng, Zhecheng, and Taikang. The National Army is pursuing them in separate routes.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Xuzhou, 29th] After the remnant bandits in western Shandong crossed the Longhai Railway, they continued to flee eastward towards Xikou (northwest of Suxian) and Wazikou (southwest of Xuzhou) on the afternoon of the 29th, with the intention of crossing the Jinpu Railway and fleeing to northern Jiangsu. The bandits are short of food and ammunition, and are deserting along the way.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Kaifeng, 28th] A unit of Chen Yi's troops, consisting of more than 2,000 people, arrived in the suburbs of Tongxu at 6:00 PM on the 28th and is engaged in fierce fighting with the local militia. Another unit of more than 2,000 people captured Weishi on the evening of the 28th and continued westward, arriving at Xindian, 45 li southeast of Kaifeng, at 7:00 PM. They are still moving westward in succession. Our city imposed a curfew in advance on the evening of the 26th. In addition, the First, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Eighty-Fourth Columns of bandits, totaling about twelve brigades, have all fled south across the Longhai Railway. More than 3,000 bandits in the southeast of the flooded area have arrived in the vicinity of Ningqiu and Xiangcheng. The National Army is preventing and blocking them.</p>
<h3>Pingbao Section Reopens to Traffic; Strengthened Joint Transportation Inside and Outside Shanhaiguan on the Beining Railway; Changshen Section of the China Changchun Railway Fully Connected</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Baoding, 29th] The Pingbao section of the Pinghan Railway reopened to traffic on the 29th. Five hundred trucks each heading north from Baoding departed at 9:00 AM, and the train heading south from Ping arrived in Baoding at 5:00 PM in the afternoon, transporting a large amount of coal, and prices in Baoding have returned to normal. It is reported that the Hebei military and political authorities have prepared countermeasures to protect the railway, mobilizing villagers and local militias along the railway to jointly maintain it, and increasing the deployment of troops to garrison Gaobeidian and Baoding, patrolling and guarding day and night, in order to smash the bandits' attempts to sabotage the railway.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Joint transportation inside and outside Shanhaiguan can now be strengthened. Xie Zhen, deputy director of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, recently arrived in Ping and reached an agreement with the Pingjin Railway Bureau to increase the number of direct military trains. In addition to the existing 301st and 302nd trains, two more direct express trains between Tianjin and Shenyang will be added. The 303rd and 304th trains will both be kept overnight in Jin County, and the existing 49th and 50th ordinary passenger trains that currently run between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan will be extended to Jinzhou and renamed as the 341st and 342nd trains, which can arrive on the same day.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Tianjin, 29th] In order to cut off traffic inside and outside Shanhaiguan, the Communist bandits have recently become more active in sabotaging the Beining Railway. On the evening of the 28th, a military train hit a mine near Chadian, causing four cars to overturn and being attacked by the Communist bandits, resulting in several hours of fierce fighting before the bandit army retreated.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, 29th] Chen Shungeng, director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, told reporters of this newspaper that he was summoned to Beijing by Minister Yu and has received the full support of the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry has agreed to allocate all the necessary funds and materials. The section from Yanzhou to Taian can be completed and open to traffic before the Double Ten Festival if there are no accidents. As for the Yanzhou-Jining line, due to the larger scale of some bridge projects, it will take longer, but it will definitely be open to traffic by the end of the year at the latest. As for the Jinzhang section of the Jiaoji Railway, due to difficulties in transporting materials, only road surface repairs can be carried out for the time being. It will be necessary to wait for the opening of the Yanzhou-Jining section of the Jinpu Railway before materials from outside can be transported. Therefore, it is estimated that the restoration time will be in March of next spring.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] The emergency repair project of the temporary railway bridge on the Dongliao River has been largely completed, and it is expected that a test run can be carried out within one or two days. The Changshen section is now fully connected.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 29th] The railway near Xingcheng between Jin and Ning on the Beining Railway was sabotaged by the Communist bandits. Passenger and freight trains heading west from Panxi only traveled to Jinxi on the 29th.</p>

<h3>Remnant Bandits Disturb Tongyang Line; Passenger Ships Robbed in Taihai</h3>
<p>The mopping-up battle in Hongze Lake is nearing its end</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Huai'an, 29th] Remnant bandits are disturbing the Tongyang Line, threatening travelers. Passenger ships in Taihai were robbed by bandits on horseback at Qingping Port at dusk on the 28th, and five passengers and sailors were captured.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Huaiyin, 28th] The mopping-up battle on the east side of Hongze Lake is nearing its end. With the cooperation of the National Army's naval forces, troops landed at Yingjiaji and Zhangjiaji on the west bank of Zheng Ying Lake, and attacked from the north and south with the elite troops that had just descended from Gaoliangjian. In the past two days, the bandits' casualties have been more than 500. Troops advancing south from Yilin are currently arriving near Qinggou Dang, and have begun to blockade the bandits in the lake.</p>
<h3>Flights on the Pingzheng-Hankou-Guangdong Route to Commence on October 1st</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Beiping, 29th] The Central Aviation Corporation's Pingzheng-Hankou-Guangdong air route has been scheduled to begin flying on October 1st. Registration has now begun, and most travelers who have already registered are those flying to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioners and County Magistrates in Western Zhejiang Hold Pacification Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] Since the bandits sneaked into Ningguo on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui and fierce fighting broke out, western Zhejiang has suddenly become tense. Although the 29th was the Mid-Autumn Festival, Chairman Shen still summoned special commissioners, county magistrates, and garrisoned troops in western Zhejiang to hold a pacification meeting, and gave instructions on appropriate measures. The meeting is scheduled to end on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Ten Assigned Japanese Warships Expected to Arrive in Qingdao Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] According to the Military News Agency, the fourth batch of ten assigned Japanese warships is expected to arrive outside Qingdao Port on the morning of the 30th. The Second Naval Base Command will send ships to guide them into the port, and a reception ceremony will be held on October 1st. Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing may personally preside over the event.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The National Government issued an order on the 29th: Appointing Navy Captains Ma Dejian and Yao Yu as representatives of the Republic of China for the assigned Japanese warships. This order is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>China Has the Right to Demand Guarantees Against Future Japanese Aggression; American Newspaper Sympathizes with Our Position on the Japanese Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] The New York Herald Tribune published an article today calling on Americans to give greater consideration to China's position on the future Japanese peace treaty. The newspaper pointed out that the painful fact of Japanese aggression against China is a terrible experience in the minds of the Chinese people, and China has the most noble reasons to demand guarantees that it will not be harmed by Japan again. The title of the editorial is "China and Japan." The newspaper stated: "Until now, the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Japan has generally been given great importance, but the attitude of the United States towards China has not been considered." Although China's public statements have been quite cautious, its dissatisfaction with the US proposal (which would be agreed to by most of the relevant countries) is no less than that of the Soviet Union. The United States and China fear that the future peace treaty with Japan may allow Japan to immediately restore its industrial and military monopoly over East Asia. For this reason, China's unwillingness to accept any peace conference plan that does not include the veto power of a major power is the same as the Soviet Union's attitude. The newspaper also stated that China had originally proposed holding a preliminary peace treaty conference with the four powers of China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States first, which would give China and the Soviet Union a veto power (if the two countries took joint action). Currently, there seems to be a possibility that China will strengthen its position and demand that each major power (including itself, of course) enjoys a veto power. Members of the Resident Committee of the Chinese Political Council, in their report to the government, suggested the above policy, and they also suggested: Abolish the Japanese "Emperor system," Japan should maintain its minimum standard of living, the Ryukyu Islands and other islands overseas of China should be placed under Chinese trusteeship, and the Allied powers should control Japan for at least thirty years. Overall, the recommendations of the Resident Committee of the Political Council seem to be excessive, but from the terrible experience that Japanese aggression has inflicted on China, its recommendations are a natural result. When formulating a peace treaty with Japan, we should remember that China has the noblest reasons to demand guarantees that it will not be harmed by Japan again. On the surface, the attitude of the Japanese seems to have changed, but it is impossible to determine what the actual situation is behind the surface. China has reason to demand guarantees for future security, which are not the empty words of some American officials that "the Japanese will become a peaceful people within a few generations."</p>
<h3>Amendments to the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators Officially Promulgated by the National Government; Election Supervisors for Overseas Chinese Electoral Districts Also Announced</h3>

<h3>Chairman of Suiyuan Sells Horses to Relieve Disaster Victims in Yimeng</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Gui Sui, 28th]</p>
<p>Suiyuan Chairman Dong Qiwu considers the disaster situation in Yimeng to be serious, and the people are starving every day. He specially sold two of his personal steeds at a price to relieve the disaster. It is said that these two steeds had followed Dong in battles in the provinces of Shanxi and Suiyuan, participating in the War of Resistance against Japan and various campaigns to suppress the rebellion. They were very precious, and Dong usually cherished them very much.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Flies to Guangdong to Assume New Post; Luo Zhuoying Bids Farewell to the Guangzhou Press</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The newly appointed Chairman of Guangdong Province, Song Ziwen, is scheduled to take a plane from Shanghai to Guangzhou at 11:00 AM today to assume office. It is said that the personnel of the Guangdong Provincial Government will not be changed for the time being. Song will go to Beijing to report on his work in two weeks.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] Chairman Luo Zhuoying recently held a cocktail party to bid farewell to reporters. He said: During his two years in charge of Guangdong, all facilities have not achieved the expected results. In the past, governance focused on public security, food, and transportation. However, due to continuous disasters and poor harvests, the food problem has not been fundamentally resolved, and food shortages cannot be avoided. Industrial construction, if there is no concrete plan, cannot guide tourism and absorb foreign exchange. Therefore, a five-year construction plan was specially drawn up last autumn to strive to develop the economy, stabilize society, and then seek to popularize education and clarify politics. Other projects such as water conservancy projects have also been implemented one after another. However, due to the banditry that has not been cleared, financial fluctuations, and successive floods, the suffering of the people cannot be alleviated, which is really regrettable. Luo finally said: "The moon is bright in Zhuhai, and the white clouds are unharmed. How dare I say that I am leaving perfectly. However, I believe that two years have not been wasted. The country has many problems, and the future is still difficult. After I leave, I will still follow the righteousness of admiring my homeland and seek happiness for my compatriots." He also expressed his gratitude to the press for their assistance over the past two years, with infinite reluctance in his words.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan's Talk Meeting Suggests Requesting Control of Sino-Korean Trade to Prevent a Crisis of Disguised Sino-Japanese Trade</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 29th]</p>
<p>The Supervisory Yuan held a talk meeting on the morning of the 29th. The attending supervisors included Wan Can, Wang Xinling, Li Xiaoting, Yu Shude, Wang Guanwu, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Shuhui, Ma Yaonan, Zhang Lu, Liu Tu, etc. The meeting decided to submit two proposals, one regarding the appointment of Song Ziwen as the head of Guangdong, and the other regarding the Sino-Korean trade case. The former was submitted to President Yu Youren for presentation to the National Government. The latter advocated strict control of Sino-Korean trade to avoid it becoming a disguised Sino-Japanese trade. After the attending supervisors signed their names, they will be transferred to be submitted. The original text of the suggestion on Sino-Korean trade passed by the Supervisory Yuan's talk meeting is as follows:</p>
<p>"For the matter of suggesting strict control of Sino-Korean trade to prevent the crisis of disguised Sino-Japanese trade, I humbly believe that recently Sino-Korean trade is about to open. China and South Korea are originally brotherly countries, and the independence and freedom of South Korea are even our country's established national policy. This is originally beneficial to both countries to promote true friendship and determine its early realization. However, Korea and Japan are neighboring countries. If Sino-Korean trade is not strictly controlled, then due to the current special circumstances, in the future, the materials that our country imports from South Korea may be transferred to Japan for use by Japan. At the same time, Japanese materials that our country does not need, which are enough to harm our national industry and national economy, may also be transferred into the country from South Korea. This should be revised and strictly controlled in advance by the departments in charge, paying attention to each other's needs on the one hand, and identifying the original place of production and the final place of sale of the materials, so as to prevent problems before they occur."</p>

<h3>National Land Administration Review Conference Opens; Chairman Chiang Issues Instructions; Recognize Facts and Implement Policies Accurately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The National Land Administration Review Conference was held in the morning of the 29th at the Lixing Society Auditorium in Nanjing. More than a hundred representatives attended, including Vice President Wang Yun-wu, Minister Zhang Lisheng, Commissioner Xiao Zheng, and representatives from various provinces. Minister Li Jingzhai presided over the ceremony and delivered the opening speech, stating briefly: Post-war land issues in our country are extremely important. During the war, land registration across the country had undergone prolonged changes and urgently needed to be cleared up. The main mission of this conference is to use scientific methods to review changes in land ownership and land rights during the war and the recovery situation in the past two years after the war, to implement land policies, strengthen land production, and achieve the ideal of "land to the tiller." Subsequently, Chen Zheng, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Land Administration, read aloud Chairman Chiang's instructions to the conference (see below). Vice President Wang then gave two points of instructions: Local autonomy is the foundation for implementing constitutional government, and land registration is the main task of local autonomy. This conference should thoroughly review the current situation of land administration implementation and formulate phased and regional steps. Land administration work should be coordinated with government policies and the work of relevant agencies, assisting each other to promote progress, to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Commissioner Xiao Zheng then delivered a speech stating that the economic reform plan aims to expand production, increase national income, and balance the national budget, and it is planned to establish a land bank and issue land bonds to revitalize finance, fully utilize land, and increase agricultural production and "land to the tiller" are established government policies, hoping the conference will pay attention to this point. After Xiao's speech, Zhu Ping, the director of the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau, delivered a reply on behalf of the attendees, and the ceremony was adjourned. A preparatory meeting and the first official session were held at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's instructions to the National Land Administration Review Conference are as follows:</p>
<p>Land is one of the three essential elements of production. Our country</p>
<p>is founded on agriculture, and most people rely on farming for a living.</p>
<p>Therefore, the distribution of land rights and the use of land resources</p>
<p>are the crux of all social problems.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the rise and fall of dynasties have been inextricably linked to this.</p>
<p>The Founding Father advocated revolution and first proposed equalizing</p>
<p>land ownership, with the aim of fundamentally solving the domestic</p>
<p>land problem and realizing the ideal of equal prosperity for all.</p>
<p>For the past twenty years, the government has followed his teachings</p>
<p>and formulated various land administration laws and regulations, hoping</p>
<p>to achieve the effects of a land revolution in daily administration.</p>
<p>However, due to insufficient enforcement and the difficulty in rapidly</p>
<p>changing traditional social customs, the continued effects have not been</p>
<p>fully realized, allowing the Communists to exploit the loopholes, using</p>
<p>land reform as an excuse to carry out their conspiracy of coercing</p>
<p>farmers and destroying rural organizations. There is no greater</p>
<p>cause for regret than this. We must deeply reflect, recognize the facts,</p>
<p>and ensure that land policies are implemented accurately. Only then</p>
<p>can the foundation of national construction be firmly established.</p>
<p>At present, mobilizing to suppress the rebellion and preparing for</p>
<p>constitutional government are progressing simultaneously. We must</p>
<p>promptly take effective measures to address the Communists'</p>
<p>perverse land reform actions, uniting rural people, improving farmers'</p>
<p>lives; and complete the basic work of local self-government,</p>
<p>truly training farmers to exercise their four rights, ensuring</p>
<p>the normal and sound development of farmers' political and economic</p>
<p>lives, thereby thoroughly defeating the Communists' conspiracy.</p>
<p>Our country's land administration agencies at all levels have already been</p>
<p>widely established. After the government accommodated the participation</p>
<p>of various parties, the Ministry of Land Administration was established</p>
<p>under the Executive Yuan to strengthen the promotion of land</p>
<p>administration. Today, as the National Land Administration Review</p>
<p>Conference opens, bringing together the heads of land administration</p>
<p>agencies from the central government and various regions, examining the</p>
<p>gains and losses of past work, and collectively seeking guidelines for</p>
<p>future efforts, the significance is extremely important. In particular,</p>
<p>most of the personnel come from pacification provinces, exploring the</p>
<p>true nature of problems through factual experience, and will surely</p>
<p>make valuable contributions.</p>
<p>However, land administration measures have two major goals: one is</p>
<p>to focus on curbing land speculation and eliminating unearned gains</p>
<p>for urban land use, using taxation based on assessed value and the</p>
<p>return of increased value to the public as means to achieve equality</p>
<p>in urban land ownership; the other is to focus on protecting tenant</p>
<p>farmers and supporting owner-cultivators for rural cultivated land, to</p>
<p>gradually achieve the goal of "land to the tiller," realizing equality</p>
<p>in rural land ownership. In recent years, the government's implementation</p>
<p>of land tax and the "25% rent reduction" are only preliminary steps</p>
<p>towards these two major goals. If these can be promoted thoroughly</p>
<p>and progressively, our country's land problem will surely be solved</p>
<p>soon. In particular, land administration in the pacification areas must</p>
<p>be based on established policies, strictly adhere to current laws and</p>
<p>regulations, uphold firm beliefs, seek technical support, overcome</p>
<p>difficulties, and faithfully implement them, so as to curb the current</p>
<p>turmoil and establish a foundation for revival. I deeply hope that all</p>
<p>comrades will contribute their knowledge, humbly review, and fully</p>
<p>promote land administration work, so that the revolutionary mission</p>
<p>can be accomplished. Great expectations are placed upon you.</p>

<h3>Kuomintang Central Memorial Week; Yu Feipeng Reports on Grain Administration; Preparing for Improvement of Military, Public, and Civilian Grain Storage and Transportation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Kuomintang Central Party</p>
<p>Headquarters held the weekly Memorial Ceremony to Dr. Sun Yat-sen</p>
<p>at 9:00 AM on the 29th in the main hall of the headquarters.</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Ji led the ceremony, followed by a report by</p>
<p>Minister of Food Yu Feipeng on the planning and improvement of</p>
<p>grain administration work for the 36th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Yu began by describing the planning situation for military, public,</p>
<p>and civilian grain, stating: This year's military grain figures are</p>
<p>based on the standard number of troops, and it is hoped that the</p>
<p>units will be able to issue them accurately in the future to avoid</p>
<p>feeling insufficient. For public grain, distribution to public</p>
<p>employees in Nanjing and Shanghai has already begun this spring,</p>
<p>requiring 300,000 dan per month, including a small amount of civilian</p>
<p>grain. It has also been implemented in Tianjin and Peiping since</p>
<p>September, requiring 150,000 bags of flour per month. If the</p>
<p>situation permits in the future, the scope of distribution will be</p>
<p>gradually expanded. For civilian food, the Purchasing and Storage</p>
<p>Committee of the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</p>
<p>(UNRRA) plans to purchase 5 million dan of wheat and 10 million dan of</p>
<p>rice this year. It has already purchased 3 million dan of wheat, and</p>
<p>the purchase of rice is entrusted to the Farmers Bank of China, which</p>
<p>has also purchased 5 million dan, all of which will be used to regulate</p>
<p>civilian prices. At the same time, UNRRA plans to use 200,000 tons</p>
<p>of grain to provide relief to civilians along the coast of our country,</p>
<p>but our country must also allocate a corresponding amount. Our</p>
<p>country has already agreed to this plan. Yu then reported on the</p>
<p>improvements in grain administration work, divided into collection,</p>
<p>warehousing, transportation, and allocation, explaining each in detail.</p>
<p>He stated: In terms of collection, it is planned that in areas with</p>
<p>inconvenient transportation, the public can pay grain taxes in legal</p>
<p>tender as much as possible. Then the collection agency can use this</p>
<p>fund to purchase from grain-producing areas, avoiding the various</p>
<p>difficulties of transportation for the public. At the same time,</p>
<p>collective grain payment can also bring many conveniences to the</p>
<p>public. The current warehouses in various places are not perfect, and</p>
<p>the ministry plans to actively build warehouses. In all grain-producing</p>
<p>areas, it will try to build larger-scale warehouses and improve them.</p>
<p>As for transportation, the ministry will pay attention to the weather</p>
<p>at all times and carry out transportation work during the agricultural</p>
<p>slack season. When mentioning the accumulated malpractices in grain</p>
<p>administration, Yu expressed that in the future, careful selection</p>
<p>of personnel and strengthened supervision can avoid the occurrence of</p>
<p>fraud. Once illegal activities are discovered, they will be severely dealt</p>
<p>with.</p>

<p>formally replied yesterday, disapproving the request and expressing</p>
<p>their retention. According to sources close to Director-General Huo</p>
<p>who spoke to reporters, Huo is actually overwhelmed by official</p>
<p>duties and physically unable to continue, and will request resignation</p>
<p>again, with a very firm intention.</p>
<p>[Further Report] Zheng Daoru, Deputy Director-General of the</p>
<p>Relief Administration, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 27th,</p>
<p>went to the office yesterday to handle official business, and returned</p>
<p>to Nanjing in the evening to attend this morning's Executive Yuan</p>
<p>meeting. He told reporters yesterday that his visit was purely to</p>
<p>handle official business and denied "acting as Director-General."</p>
<p>According to Zheng, as far as he knows, Director-General Huo's</p>
<p>request for resignation was purely due to being overwhelmed by official</p>
<p>duties and illness. The external rumors that it was due to the</p>
<p>impeachment by the Control Yuan are absolutely untrue. The</p>
<p>Executive Yuan has now formally retained him. Regarding Deputy</p>
<p>Director-General Li Zhuomin, the Executive Yuan has imposed a suspension,</p>
<p>not "removal" or "dismissal." According to the regulations, after a</p>
<p>suspension, he can be reinstated if the Judicial Yuan's investigation</p>
<p>finds no criminal evidence. Therefore, there is currently no successor</p>
<p>to Li. Li's salary has now been suspended, but if he is reinstated,</p>
<p>it will be paid retroactively.</p>

<h3>Who Would Want to Be a Dancer Unless Pressured by Circumstances? Thousands of Guangzhou Dancers Gather to Appeal for Postponement of the Dance Ban; Wang Xiaoying Agrees to Request on Their Behalf from the Government</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] All the dancers and dance industry</p>
<p>workers in the city recently held a meeting to discuss requesting the</p>
<p>municipal government to postpone the implementation of the dance ban.</p>
<p>Nearly a thousand people attended, and the dancers were all lightly made</p>
<p>up and had worried expressions. The dancers who spoke included Li Lili,</p>
<p>Qu Ziyan, Cao Liying, Zhu Meili, Huang Pingting, and others, all of</p>
<p>whom said: Who would want to be a dancer unless pressured by</p>
<p>circumstances? They hoped that people in society would sympathize with</p>
<p>them and called on the government to postpone the dance ban to avoid</p>
<p>directly or indirectly affecting more than 5,000 people, whose livelihoods</p>
<p>would have no way to be solved. Their voices were tearful, moving the</p>
<p>entire audience. Legislative Member Wang Xiaoying, attending the</p>
<p>meeting as the person in charge of the Guangdong Women's Occupational</p>
<p>Promotion Association, spoke, saying that dancing is a noble form of</p>
<p>entertainment, but under the general mobilization order, soldiers at</p>
<p>the front are killing enemies, and people in the rear should live</p>
<p>frugally. Therefore, the dance ban is imperative. The current problem</p>
<p>is the relief measures after the dance ban. She is willing to request</p>
<p>from the government, under the condition that it does not conflict</p>
<p>with the laws and regulations, to postpone the implementation of the</p>
<p>dance ban. The dancers all expressed their gratitude. It is heard</p>
<p>that the Municipal Government is considering this issue and may postpone</p>
<p>the implementation for several months.</p>
<h3>Press Conference in Warsaw (Continued)</h3>
<p>A temporary translator translates important news and opinions</p>
<p>for me every day. During these few days in Poland, three major</p>
<p>news items covered all the pages: the purge of the Socialist Party,</p>
<p>the "foolish" Paris Conference, and the Chinese Civil War and</p>
<p>Wedemeyer's visit to China. Except for the Poland Peasant Party's</p>
<p>organ, the "Lok Duvar" newspaper publishing Reuters, Associated Press,</p>
<p>United Press's Chinese war news, the rest were all publishing</p>
<p>the same TASS news.</p>
<p>Many Polish intellectuals are now closely concerned about the</p>
<p>situation in China. They are not interested in China's internal</p>
<p>affairs, but are wary that the chaos in China may trigger another</p>
<p>major catastrophe for humanity.</p>
<p>There are currently two cities in Europe that are frantically</p>
<p>discussing war: one is Berlin, and the other is Warsaw. Germans talk</p>
<p>about war, using the future war to comfort themselves. They dream</p>
<p>that Germany might be resurrected in the next great war. Poles talk</p>
<p>about war, but with a kind of excitement. Excitement can be seen in</p>
<p>two ways. One emotion is the desire to use war to break open the</p>
<p>gloomy situation, and the other emotion is the fear that when the</p>
<p>Third World War comes, they will suffer unimaginable hardships.</p>
<p>Overseas Anecdotes</p>
<p>There is a Warsaw city</p>
<p>matter that I should</p>
<p>mention:</p>
<p>A Polish-American scientist,</p>
<p>participated in the research work</p>
<p>of the atomic bomb in the United States.</p>
<p>One day, to visit relatives,</p>
<p>suddenly returned to Warsaw, many Bielan friends</p>
<p>surrounded him to talk about "overseas anecdotes,"</p>
<p>Finally, he talked about the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The scientist boasted about the power of the American atomic</p>
<p>bomb: "The Hiroshima bomb,</p>
<p>650,000 people died. The future war,</p>
<p>is the atomic bomb war!"</p>
<p>A Warsaw friend asked: "If a</p>
<p>city as big as London, how many</p>
<p>atomic bombs would it take to destroy it?"</p>
<p>The scientist pondered for a while, picked up a pencil,</p>
<p>and gradually calculated from the distribution of land</p>
<p>population, industrial</p>
<p>equipment, and so on. Finally calculated</p>
<p>the result: "It takes about four atomic</p>
<p>bombs!"</p>
<p>The young man asked again: "Then, like</p>
<p>such a large country as France, how many</p>
<p>atomic bombs would be needed to</p>
<p>completely destroy its major cities,</p>
<p>major industries, and transportation lifelines?"</p>
<p>The scientist spent a lot of effort and calculated for a long time.</p>
<p>for a long time, saying: "It takes at least fourteen atomic</p>
<p>bombs, to make France unable to lift</p>
<p>its head!"</p>
<p>"Then how many atomic bombs</p>
<p>would it take to destroy a</p>
<p>larger country like Soviet Russia?"</p>
<p>The scientist said without hesitation: "One</p>
<p>hundred and seventy-eight bombs!"</p>
<p>This story is circulating in Warsaw, very</p>
<p>universally. In fact, what I have</p>
<p>heard in Europe is not just in Warsaw.</p>
<p>However, Poles are particularly sensitive and particularly like</p>
<p>to spread the story, and tell it vividly.</p>
<p>Rumors are creating fear in Poland, and</p>
<p>Poles, who are as smart as the French, are</p>
<p>becoming more and more aware that they are</p>
<p>a "tragedy."</p>
<p>Behind the "Iron Curtain", they are not like</p>
<p>other Slavs, who believe in their</p>
<p>"leader" as invincible.</p>
<p>Red Outside, White Inside</p>
<p>In terms of post-war geography, Poland</p>
<p>is the vanguard of the Iron Curtain. They</p>
<p>are easy to contact with the UK and the US, easy</p>
<p>to understand. From a cultural point of view, Poles</p>
<p>have always been a powerful seed</p>
<p>of Western European culture, especially a faithful</p>
<p>practitioner of French culture.</p>
<p>In Warsaw, almost every Pole</p>
<p>can speak French. The more proficient in French,</p>
<p>the more exalted his social status. In the Louis</p>
<p>era, the French court etiquette</p>
<p>, is no longer seen in Paris, but</p>
<p>is deeply rooted in Poland, in the so-called high</p>
<p>society. No European</p>
<p>country's men would kiss</p>
<p>female guests' hands so seriously. Even in the poorest Polish</p>
<p>homes, you can't ignore those</p>
<p>etiquettes.</p>
<p>Before the war, Polish primary and secondary schools</p>
<p>taught French. This is the Polish Ministry of Education</p>
<p>required foreign language. Now, public</p>
<p>schools are teaching Russian. Private</p>
<p>"English night schools" are all the rage. Family</p>
<p>tutors charge 500 "paper"</p>
<p>(Polish currency name) per hour to teach English, teaching</p>
<p>French only costs two hundred.</p>
<p>German is also unusually common in Poland,</p>
<p>which is the result of five years of conquest.</p>
<p>In the minds of Poles, in terms of culture,</p>
<p>they look down on Russia and respect</p>
<p>Western European countries. Because Germany</p>
<p>is its enemy, the environment created the need for them to</p>
<p>court France. After the First World War,</p>
<p>France was a</p>
<p>strong supporter of the Polish restoration movement.</p>
<p>Marshal Siemierski, the Minister of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, who currently holds the military lifeline of Poland,</p>
<p>is a standard "French"</p>
<p>character. He used to study at the French military school,</p>
<p>and later participated in the restoration movement led by</p>
<p>General Piłsudski.</p>
<p>In the later period of General Piłsudski's regime, he was close to</p>
<p>Nazi fascism. Siemierski</p>
<p>went into seclusion and returned to France.</p>
<p>During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Siemierski</p>
<p>travelled between France and Poland, doing "underground</p>
<p>movements," and later made contact with the Soviet Russian side.</p>
<p>Now, entering and exiting the Polish Ministry of National Defense</p>
<p>are all Russian</p>
<p>military advisers wearing red star hats. Some people also say: There are</p>
<p>many plainclothes disguised Russians</p>
<p>working. However, the Bielan people still believe</p>
<p>that Siemierski himself is "red outside,</p>
<p>white inside," meaning that his</p>
<p>duty requires him to deal with the Russians, but</p>
<p>his heart is completely "un-Red."</p>
<p>I didn't visit the Ministry of National Defense, and I</p>
<p>don't know if these are true or false. Foreign journalists</p>
<p>often ask many bizarre rumors</p>
<p>, to General Grotocz. Once,</p>
<p>I don't know which reporter said: "It's recently been rumored in the city of Warsaw</p>
<p>that the Soviet Russia is also going to convene a</p>
<p>conference, to confront the Paris Conference. Is this</p>
<p>true or false?" General Grotocz</p>
<p>very cleverly replied: "Tell you,</p>
<p>there is one city with the most rumors in Europe</p>
<p>, and this city is called Warsaw!" (At the Bristol Hotel)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Flies to Guangdong to Take Office</h3>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen's appointment as Chairman of Guangdong Province was approved by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Meeting on the 19th of this month. He is scheduled to fly to Guangdong today to assume his new post. How Mr. Song will implement his new plans is presumably already well thought out. It is said that after spending about twenty days in Guangdong, Mr. Song will come to the capital city as a general. At that time, there may be some adjustments in the personnel of the Guangdong Provincial Government to facilitate the promotion of provincial governance reforms.</p>
<p>Mr. Song's current tenure in Guangdong comes approximately six months after he resigned from the position of President of the Executive Yuan. Given Mr. Song's past history in the Kuomintang, his experience in national politics, and his decisive and responsible work style, coupled with being at the prime of his career, it is only natural for him to return to the political stage.</p>
<p>However, what has particularly drawn the attention of Chinese and foreign individuals is why Mr. Song, having resigned from the prestigious position of President of the Executive Yuan (an appointed position), would willingly take on the lower-ranked position of Provincial Chairman (a simplified appointment). Little do they know that such notions of position and rank are definitely not what revolutionaries think. "To do great things, one does not need to be a high-ranking official" was a valuable teaching of the Father of the Nation, and Mr. Song is a devout follower. Moreover, Guangdong Province is Mr. Song's hometown, and it has suffered severe flooding, rampant smuggling, and the presence of bandits. With the central government placing great hope on him, how could a revolutionary entertain the idea of retirement? Mr. Song's ability to obey the government's orders, abandoning the superficial concept of "face" associated with position and rank, and dedicating himself to the place where the nation currently needs him most is truly setting a new trend in Chinese politics. Zhang, the President of the Executive Yuan, recently said "Talent should be applied to frontier regions." Mr. Song's current mission is truly the first shot in "Talent should be applied to frontier regions."</p>
<p>Guangdong is the cradle of the revolution, and Mr. Song is a person who has been personally taught by the revolutionary mentor. The current Guangdong, as Vice Chairman Sun stated, has regressed significantly compared to the era of the Northern Expedition. It needs someone with talent, courage, and the deep trust of the central government, like Mr. Song, to boldly and resolutely carry out a reform endeavor. When the Guangdong provincial personnel are adjusted in the future, we further hope that Mr. Song will be able to select first-class talents for Guangdong, taking into account local conditions and acting with impartiality, to jointly strive for the renewal of local politics.</p>
<p>In light of Mr. Song's governance of Guangdong, we would also like to take this opportunity to offer some suggestions to the central authorities: The constitution clearly stipulates the powers of the central and local governments as "balanced," with provinces becoming high-level local autonomous organizations. Therefore, the central authorities preparing to implement the constitution should change their past conceptions, enhance the powers of the provincial governments, and allow ambitious and talented chairmen to lead their cadres and strive for the overall goal of reforming local politics and relieving the suffering of the people. The central government should only supervise and evaluate, without interfering in everything, so that local officials are not rendered powerless despite having a title, and constantly fear making mistakes. Secondly, when discussing local politics, the separation of military and civilian affairs and the governance by civilians has become a well-worn and familiar phrase. However, the outside world has long rumored that the military chairmen of some provinces may be replaced, but the central government is still hesitating. This is certainly due to the turbulence of the situation and the careful selection of candidates, which is unavoidable. However, in provincial governments that are not in pacification areas, selecting civilian officials to govern, based on the principle of appointing the wise and talented, may well be a way to make a fresh start and refresh the people's perception.</p>
<h3>Convening of the National Land Administration Conference</h3>
<p>The National Land Administration Conference opened in the capital yesterday. According to Land Administration Minister Li Jingzhai in his opening address, the convening of this conference is "an unprecedented event in our country and the first conference since the establishment of the Ministry of Land Administration." President Chiang attached great importance to land administration. On the day of the conference's opening, he issued a special instruction, giving many instructions for the future promotion of land administration. We feel that the convening of the National Land Administration Conference is of profound significance. In addition to wishing the conference success and hoping that the authorities can vigorously implement the resolutions of the conference after it concludes, so as to carry out land administration reform, we would like to offer some further comments.</p>
<p>Our country has been based on agriculture for thousands of years, and the land problem has become the root of social problems. As President Chiang stated, "The disputes, governance, chaos, rise, and fall of dynasties are all related to the land problem." Therefore, the Father of the Nation's advocacy of equal land rights is indeed a fundamental solution to China's social problems. The land policy of the Three Principles of the People originally had clear instructions, one being equal land rights and the other being land to the tiller, with the focus on "equal rights" and "ownership." Thus, the land policy of the Three Principles of the People does not involve the immediate nationalization of land or the socialization of land, but rather the maintenance of the private ownership system of land. However, for the sake of public interests, the government may legally restrict the use of privately owned land. Currently, the communist bandits are harassing the countryside, and the government is mobilizing to quell the rebellion. It can be seen that stabilizing the people's livelihood and consolidating the morale of the rural population are particularly important. It is hoped that our land administration authorities will strictly adhere to the teachings of the Father of the Nation and the instructions issued by the chairman of this land administration conference, so as to faithfully promote the land policy of the Three Principles of the People, so that our farmers, who have suffered greatly, can have a chance to catch their breath, and rural construction will have a bright future.</p>
<p>The scope that may be discussed at this land administration conference is likely to be quite broad. According to reports, the proposals for the conference roughly include: Establishing a land bank to coordinate with land policy; strengthening assistance to owner-farmers; opening collective farms and cooperative farms, etc. Because the system of primogeniture has long been extinct in China, and the law of inheritance in large proportions is not followed, there are really no true large landlords in China. Most of our large landlords are based on the power they have seized through annexation, rather than inheritance. Compared with the large landlords in Europe and Japan before the war, they are not the same. In the Northeast and North China, the proportion of owner-farmers is very high. However, because inheritance of property is divided and subdivided again and again, the area of farmland owned by owner-farmers is also decreasing, thus casting a shadow on agricultural production that is extremely unfavorable to mechanized farming. We hope that this land administration conference can have proper and feasible decisions on assisting owner-farmers and protecting tenant farmers.</p>
<p>Speaking of collective farms, this was originally a policy implemented by the Soviet Union after implementing its five-year plan, the purpose of which was to eliminate owner-farmers in order to achieve land nationalization or land socialization. In terms of its spirit, it may not be compatible with the land policy of the Three Principles of the People. As for cooperative farms, their nature is quite different from that of collective farms. Our country currently has many owner-farmers with very little cultivated land. The adoption of this cooperative farm system may well be sufficient to achieve the goal of strengthening assistance to owner-farmers. How exactly the cooperative farm system should be formulated in order to promote it to its fullest advantage is something that we especially hope this land administration conference will carefully study.</p>
<p>Regarding finance, in recent years our government has paid considerable attention to the land economy of farmers. There is already the establishment of the Farmers Bank of China and the creation of the Central Cooperative Treasury. In addition, state-owned banks and bureaus, such as the Central Trust Bureau, are also primarily responsible for coordinating agricultural land finance. At this time, whether a separate land bank should be created immediately outside of the existing system needs to be considered at length. Rather than considering something that is not yet mature and immediately establishing a large-scale organization, it seems better to instruct existing financial institutions to change their perspective and focus on lending for rural land, so that farmers have access to financing opportunities.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many things we should do in terms of land administration. We sincerely hope that this unprecedented land administration conference can lay a good foundation for the future land administration reform of our country.</p>

<h3>Truman Calls Meeting to Discuss Emergency Measures for Aid to Europe; Estimated Need of $500 Million This Year</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] New York, 29th (Broadcast): President Truman met with eleven Congressional leaders and six government advisors at 10:00 AM today to discuss whether emergency aid could be given to European countries without convening a special session of Congress. The issue of controlling domestic prices will also be involved. Secretary of State Marshall returned from New York to Washington specifically to present his views on the serious food situation in Europe. According to Secretary Marshall, the United States cannot stand idly by in the face of this situation in Europe and must provide assistance before the end of the year. It is understood that Truman believes that this emergency expenditure will require at least $500 million in the next four months. France and Italy are in particular need of assistance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] President Truman is scheduled to meet with leaders of both houses of Congress at the White House at 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time today to ask for their support for transitional and long-term aid plans for Europe, and intends to launch a two-pronged war against high domestic prices and foreign famine. If Truman cannot obtain the cooperation of Congressional leaders to implement immediate aid to Europe, Europe may be close to collapse due to the lack of dollars, food, and fuel. Secretary of State Marshall returned to Washington from New York last night to join Secretary of Commerce Harriman, Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, and Undersecretary of State Lovett in attending the talks between the President and Congressional leaders. The issues to be decided at this meeting will include the following: Will Congressional leaders agree to use the existing funds of federal agencies, such as the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation, totaling approximately $500 million, to urgently assist countries facing intolerable cold and hunger, especially Italy and France? Do Congressional leaders recognize the need to convene a special session of Congress? After the United States officially accepts the mission of revitalizing Europe, that is, after the emergency crisis this winter is over, will Congressional leaders give the same special attention to the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe? Will Congressional leaders support Truman's waste reduction campaign to prevent further reductions in the current food export targets? Will Congressional leaders recognize the need to restore some of the government's wartime privileges through legislation to ensure that a sufficient amount of grain can be supplied to Europe this winter?</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Marshall is scheduled to fly back here from New York tonight to consult with Truman and leaders of both parties in Congress. Marshall only plans to stay here for one day on the 29th, and will fly back to New York the same night after the meeting. Marshall has previously stated that he is in favor of convening a special session of Congress, and it is expected that he will appeal to Congressional leaders. A few days ago, when Marshall was in Washington, he discussed the convening of a special session with Truman, but the President still did not agree to adopt this approach. It is said that Truman still advocates waiting until the formal convening of Congress on January 6th next year. Marshall has repeatedly emphasized that Europe cannot wait for the development of the aid to Europe plan and needs to be assisted immediately.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Regardless of whether Truman decides to convene a special session or not, the pressure to take administrative decisions immediately on domestic prices and foreign relief issues has been increasing daily. Some American officials are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the "self-help" guarantees of Europe under the Marshall Plan. After studying the reports submitted by Western European countries, they stated that the appeals of Western European countries seem to be "asking for assistance," rather than the "self-help" proposed by Marshall.</p>
<h3>Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe Not Easy to Implement in the Short Term; Congress Seems Unlikely to Take Swift Action</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The hope of the United States Congress taking swift and decisive action on the Marshall Plan has diminished. According to current forecasts, even if a special session of Congress is convened, it will not be possible to convene until December, and legislative procedures will not be completed until April next year. Some experts believe that although the recommendations made by Europe have a reasonable plan, it will be difficult for Truman and the State Department to convince Congress that Europe has a serious military crisis and must be given maximum assistance before Europe can promote its ability to help itself.</p>
<p>The report of the sixteen-nation economic conference was published just in time</p>
<p>in a week of international turmoil. The obvious features</p>
<p>can be said to be the following:</p>
<p>US officials are well aware that before the Marshall Plan can be fully</p>
<p>considered, the assistance to Europe to make up for shortages</p>
<p>cannot be delayed; some senior officials are hesitant about</p>
<p>the issue of convening a special session of Congress;</p>
<p>Vishinsky's speech caused various degrees of confusion and</p>
<p>resentment in American public opinion; after the report</p>
<p>of the sixteen-nation conference was released, members of both houses</p>
<p>took a very cautious attitude. American experts are already</p>
<p>finding it difficult to verify the facts provided in the sixteen-nation report,</p>
<p>as the report was drafted on the basis of broad</p>
<p>general regions rather than detailed and accurate analysis of a few countries or a certain region.</p>
<p>The United States is expected to have lengthy debates</p>
<p>on the following aspects of the report: Will US assistance</p>
<p>at the level requested in the report place too heavy a burden</p>
<p>on the United States? Are there other methods</p>
<p>that can replace government loans, such as restoring</p>
<p>large-scale private investment? Is the Western European</p>
<p>self-reliance plan appropriate if it does not include some of the more easterly</p>
<p>countries, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia? Is</p>
<p>the US aid to Europe plan necessarily to be given in the form of a gift,</p>
<p>or are there other alternative methods that can be discussed?</p>
<h3>Connally and Others Oppose Convening a Special Session of Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] President Truman is scheduled to convene an important meeting tomorrow. Senate Democratic leaders Connally and Lucas are also among those invited. They stated that there is no need to convene a special session of Congress. Lucas said today that if Congress holds a special session at the moment, it may not achieve anything. Connally said that he hoped that a special session of Congress could be avoided. He said that he did not know what important matters needed to be discussed other than the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Pepper Advocates Expanding the Scope of the Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Although Representative Pepper denied that his diplomatic policy had broken down with Wallace, he also guaranteed unconditional support for the Marshall Plan to revitalize non-communist Western Europe. Pepper said that the report submitted by Western European countries to the United States did not contain the political implications that he had feared. He would support this plan, but he insisted on expanding the scope of the plan to include Eastern Europe under the leadership of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Arab Countries to Hold General Strike Tomorrow to Protest Partition of Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th] The Palestinian Arab community, at the call of the Arab Higher Committee, is scheduled to hold a general strike and market strike on October 3 to protest the partition plan for Palestine. Arab leaders will send telegrams to leaders of various countries and well-known organizations, and speeches will be delivered at prayer meetings. It is heard that Hussein, the Muslim leader of Jerusalem, who is currently in Egypt, has sent a message to the Arab Committee, asking the Arabs not to take violent action.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Baghdad, 29th] Iraqi political parties will launch a nationwide demonstration and strike on October 3 at the request of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee.</p>

<h3>East-West Split Widens, French Diplomacy at a Crossroads: Revival of Germany Must Not Impede French Security</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] If the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in London in November does not reach an agreement on the future status of Germany, then cooperation between France and the United Kingdom and the United States to organize Western Europe, especially Western Germany, will become more active. Official French spokespersons have so far denied that there will be any changes in French foreign policy. Technically speaking, this statement is indeed factual. However, France's position on the German question is that a four-power agreement should resolve the German question, taking into account its own minimum security needs. However, in the context of the widening East-West split, France's intermediate position has undergone some changes, at least behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If the November Foreign Ministers Conference fails to reach a four-power agreement and the United Kingdom and the United States decide to proceed with establishing a peacetime basis for West Germany regardless of the Soviet Union, then France will undoubtedly participate with the United Kingdom and the United States. If that happens, two problems will arise, one domestic and one concerning relations with the United Kingdom and the United States. Domestically, participating with the United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably provoke opposition from the Communist Party, but if France can obtain some quid pro quo, it may be possible to appease some domestic sentiment.</p>

<h3>Tram Workers Stage Illegal Strike, Mayor Announces Measures: Those Who Delay Resumption of Work Will Be Dismissed Unconditionally</h3>
<p>"Reported by this newspaper" Mayor Wu, regarding the tram workers' strike, specially invited reporters to the City Hall conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday to announce the Municipal Government's attitude and four measures for dealing with this matter: Those who incite the strike will be severely punished according to the National General Mobilization Law. Wages will not be paid during the strike period. Those who obstruct the driving of trams will be immediately arrested on the spot by personnel dispatched from the Garrison Command and Police Bureau, on charges of obstructing traffic and endangering public safety, and may be dealt with severely according to military law. If necessary, the Social Affairs Bureau will be ordered to copy the list of those who delay resuming work and treat them as voluntarily resigning their positions, and dismiss them unconditionally, to be replaced by unemployed workers capable of driving trams.</p>
<p>The Mayor first stated: The workers' strikes of both the British and French tram companies did not follow legal procedures and violated the Labor Law and the National General Mobilization Law. These workers, who have been deceived, are being used by communist bandits. The workers' claim that the cost of living index does not match reality is unfounded. In fact, the indices are compiled according to scientific methods, and the figures obtained by the General Labor Union are completely consistent, which proves their accuracy. The General Labor Union previously notified all members that if they had any doubts, they could inquire with the union. Now, instead of making requests according to legal procedures, they have abruptly gone on strike, which is a disruptive act by treacherous bandits. The Mayor also stated: He hopes that good workers will not listen to the rumors of troublemakers and make unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>Those Who Obstruct Trams and Resist Arrest Will Be Shot Without Mercy</p>
<p>"Central News Agency" Police Chief Superintendent Shu Ping told reporters that the British tram workers had already begun to resume work yesterday. The complications involving the French tram workers can also be resolved today. However, it was discovered yesterday that some unscrupulous individuals were obstructing trams along the way, attempting to prevent the resumption of work and continue to create major incidents. He has ordered all branches to pay close attention. If anyone continues to obstruct trams, they will be immediately arrested and prosecuted. If they attempt to resist with force, they will be shot on the spot without mercy.</p>
<h3>British Tramcars Resume Service: Social Bureau Instructs "Do Not Fall for the Enemy's Tricks," Union Resolves to Resume Work Immediately</h3>
<p>"Reported by this newspaper" British tramcars have gradually resumed service since yesterday afternoon, and it is hoped that all will resume work today. However, French tramcars and public buses did not run yesterday, so the majority of public transportation in the city still relied on the City Public Utility Bureau's public buses. Passengers at each station felt doubly crowded. Moreover, yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and citizens were busy going back and forth, so rickshaws and pedicabs were all making a profit a hundredfold.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, 36 tramcars on lines 7, 8, 10, and 11 from the British Hui Shan Depot, adopted a workaround, running only lines 8 and 10, with a total of 33 tramcars dispatched, departing on time. The Jing'an Temple Depot's streetcar and trackless trolley lines were all suspended due to the workers' strike.</p>
<p>The Social Bureau sent an instruction to the British Tram Industry Union in the morning, stating: "Upon investigation, the tram and public bus industries are related to public transportation, and it is not permitted to suspend operations arbitrarily. Especially during this period of national general mobilization, it is even less permissible to strike or slack off without authorization, as has been repeatedly ordered. The union's actions have generally been law-abiding. In this extraordinary period, it should strive to work hard to maintain the interests of the public. It is reported that some workers in the union went on strike without cause yesterday, using the inaccurate cost of living index as an excuse, but they did not apply to the bureau for verification through the union in accordance with the law. It is clear that someone is inciting them to deliberately disrupt the situation. The cost of living index is investigated, compiled, and managed by the Municipal Government, and it has always been extremely cautious. Before each announcement, representatives from relevant agencies are invited to jointly review it to ensure accuracy. The matter is technical in nature, and there are numerical bases, so there is no possibility of arbitrary increase or decrease. Moreover, the General Labor Union, representing all workers in the city, also conducted its own investigation and compilation this month. The figures compiled by the General Labor Union are roughly the same as those compiled by the Municipal Government, which further shows that the city's cost of living index is absolutely accurate. The union should use this understanding to carefully explain and supervise all members to resume work and continue working as usual today, and not fall for the enemy's cunning tricks that obstruct public transportation. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Workers Receive Instructions, Hold Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the union immediately posted the full text of the instruction in front of the tram depot for public knowledge, and added, "Upon investigation, the union was not aware of this unfortunate incident beforehand or afterward. It is clear that actions were taken by someone acting under a false name. We hope that all members will abide by the instructions of the Social Bureau and the agency in charge and resume normal work immediately, and do not violate them. If there are reasons for complaint, you can appeal to the union, which will forward them for verification. Do not be used by others."</p>
<p>The union also convened the 23rd emergency meeting of the board of directors and supervisors at the union office at 10:30 AM, resolving that the union would immediately launch a campaign to resume tram operations. If any tramcars are obstructed en route, please have the military police protect them. As for the inaccurate cost of living index for this month, the union will petition the authorities to amend it.</p>
<p>Although it was difficult to gather workers because of the festival, under the union's persuasion, several tramcars on line 2 were the first to depart at 12:30 PM. Afterwards, more trams departed continuously. By evening, lines 2, 20, 24, and 3 of the Jing'an Temple Depot's streetcar and trackless trolley lines had resumed service, with 20 tramcars on line 2, 20 on line 20, 7 on line 24, and 3 on line 3. According to the union, it is possible that all lines will resume service today.</p>
<p>After the city's trams were suspended, the city's public buses became extremely crowded.</p>

<h3>Shui Xiangyun Discusses to Resolve Doubts About the Index</h3>
<p>The workers of the British Tram Company expressed doubts about the cost of living index for September, leading to a work stoppage. General Labor Union President Shui Xiangyun issued the following statement yesterday: "Although this index is compiled by the Municipal Government Research Office, the union has also entrusted various unions to investigate commodity prices and submit them to the union for separate compilation, starting this month. The figures obtained are roughly the same as the figures compiled by the Municipal Government this time. The reason is that although the price of japonica rice has risen sharply this month, workers use indica rice as a standard for food rice, and the price of indica rice this month is still around 300,000 yuan. Moreover, the government distributes 2 dou per person, priced at 240,000 yuan. Although the market price of briquettes exceeds 80,000 yuan, the government distributes 1 dan per person, priced at 28,000 yuan. Although granulated sugar has also skyrocketed, the government distributes 1 jin per person. There is a huge difference between the allocated price and the market price. The above-mentioned major items in the cost of living index are all calculated based on the allocated price. Outsiders do not understand the inside story, which leads to doubts. If various unions have any doubts, they can inquire with the union about the content of the compiled materials, which can prove that this matter is accurate."</p>

<h3>Yu Jingcheng Sentenced to Imprisonment, Workers Gather to Protest Injustice</h3>
<p>"Reported by this newspaper" The case of Yu Jingcheng, Chairman of the Union of the 12th Factory of China Textile, murdering Liu Meilin and Li Zhen, workers of the factory, was tried and concluded by Judge Lian Zhenbang of the Third Criminal Court of the District Court. The sentence was pronounced at 3:00 PM yesterday. The main text: Yu Jingcheng is guilty of murder and is sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Qian Meilong, Ren Tingzhong, and Wang Yansheng are jointly guilty of intentionally inflicting bodily harm and are each sentenced to seven months of imprisonment. One Ma Pai pistol and nine bullets are confiscated. The civil claim for compensation is transferred to the Immigration Court. The main points of the reasons for the judgment are four: Although the defendant claimed that his pistol was seized by someone, causing the bullet to be fired and killing Liu and Li, the defendant could not point out who seized the pistol. The claim that if the defendant did not have a gun in hand, he would have been beaten down by the six or seven workers is not valid. However, an investigation revealed that the defendant was not injured, which shows that the defendant had a gun in hand. The plaintiffs, Liu and Li's family, Qian Hailong, Gao Hongye, and others, unanimously attacked the defendant for firing a shot first, knocking down Liu Jilin, and then firing a shot, knocking down Li Zhen. Seeing that they were not dead, he added another shot, which proves the defendant's criminal facts. The workers in the factory were all unarmed, so for the defendant's self-defense, he only needed to fire a shot into the sky to threaten them, which was enough to achieve the purpose of self-defense.</p>
<p>More than a hundred workers from China Textile who were listening in the court expressed that Yu Jingcheng was "wronged." They gathered in the District Court Square, holding small flags, posting slogans on the walls, and writing slogans with chalk, refusing to disperse for a long time, demanding that Yu be acquitted. Yu was later escorted out of the court through the back door by bailiffs to be executed at the Tilanqiao Prison. The workers from China Textile, upon hearing the news, still insisted on not leaving. It was not until around 5:00 PM that Councilor Fan Cai arrived at the scene to persuade them to return to the factory.</p>

<h3>Manager of Zhengtai Company Detained While Handling US Dollar Exchange</h3>
<p>"Reported by this newspaper" The Bureau of Public Safety's Economic Section detected that Zhengtai Company, located on the third floor of 293 Hankou Road, was engaged in large-scale black market trading of US dollars. Yesterday morning, Section Chief Xu dispatched Team Leader Jing Qinghai, along with officers Lin Zhangsen, Peng Changrong, Yang Guoxian, and others, carrying a check, to pose as customers. They contacted Yang Wenzhang, the manager of the company. As a result, they completed a transaction of US$6,500. Just as they were about to settle the transaction, the police officers revealed their identities and detained Yang. They also searched the premises and found a total of US$7,115, which they took to the bureau along with Yang. According to Yang, the US dollars were shipped to Shanghai by Li Tongyun, the manager of Yixingxiang in Qingdao, and entrusted to him for sale. The police bureau, believing that the case was clear, confiscated all of the seized US dollars, and the suspect was temporarily released on bail.</p>
<h3>A Fatal Injection for Scabies: Doctor Claims Patient's Weakness Was to Blame</h3>
<p>"Our News" Doctor Huang Ke-fang</p>
<p>is accused of negligent homicide,</p>
<p>and the trial opened yesterday in the Criminal Court of the District Court.</p>
<p>It began with Yang Lu-chuan, who was employed by the police</p>
<p>department. On June 17th, at approximately 7:00 PM, he and</p>
<p>his friend Zhang You-qing drove in a motorcycle from Zhang's residence on Zhongzheng East Road</p>
<p>to the clinic of the accused, Huang</p>
<p>Ke-fang, at 346 Yunnan Road, seeking treatment for a scabies</p>
<p>condition. Huang, noting that the disease had been treated multiple times, did not examine him</p>
<p>but immediately ordered his assistant Zhang Zheng-feng to inject 6.5 cc of medication</p>
<p>in a single shot. Unexpectedly, Yang reacted severely. In less than five</p>
<p>minutes, his limbs turned cold. He passed away from heart failure at 9:27 AM the following morning. The Old</p>
<p>Branch Bureau arrested Huang and handed him over to the District Court. According to Huang's</p>
<p>testimony: he and the victim had a friendly relationship,</p>
<p>and this incident was due to the victim's excessive weakness.</p>
<p>The victim's family is demanding compensation of</p>
<p>one hundred million yuan, which the accused claims he cannot afford.</p>
<p>The court ordered that the criminal part be retried on the sixth of next month,</p>
<p>while the civil part was to allow both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court.</p>
<h3>*Shen Bao*'s "Scholarship Fund" Recruitment Ends Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday</p>
<p>was the</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>, and readers</p>
<p>must have</p>
<p>enjoyed a</p>
<p>day of celebration. However, in the vast city, countless</p>
<p>poor young people are agonizing over their studies, and many parents are worried about their</p>
<p>children's tuition. Of course, they will not have the leisure to enjoy the moon,</p>
<p>nor will they have extra money to eat mooncakes.</p>
<p>Dear readers, if you can save a little extravagance and donate some money to</p>
<p>the "Reader Scholarship Fund," perhaps a young person on the verge of being deprived of education</p>
<p>will have the opportunity to continue their studies!</p>
<p>Today is the last day for the "Reader Scholarship Fund" to collect donations. We hope</p>
<p>that readers will seize this last opportunity to give more assistance to needy students, so that the</p>
<p>"Reader Scholarship Fund" can come to a perfect end.</p>
<h3>Frugality in Gift-Giving, but No Moon on Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>"Our News" Yesterday was the traditional</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival. All agencies and schools did not</p>
<p>take a holiday. The banking industry also operated as usual.</p>
<p>Money was extremely tight, and the amount of exchanged checks</p>
<p>increased dramatically. The stock market interest rate was 25 to 28 cents.</p>
<p>However, despite the calls for frugality,</p>
<p>the practice of giving gifts was not</p>
<p>eliminated. The sales of mooncakes and chickens and ducks</p>
<p>were good, and the demand for vegetables, fish, and meat</p>
<p>increased even more, causing prices to rise</p>
<p>considerably higher than usual. In terms of transportation, because streetcars</p>
<p>have not fully resumed operation, pedicabs and</p>
<p>rickshaws took the opportunity to raise prices. The roads</p>
<p>were filled with people, resembling long dragons.</p>
<p>Looking up at the sky, it was overcast all day</p>
<p>without rain, and the bright moon did not appear at night.</p>
<p>Families still competed to burn incense and light</p>
<p>firecrackers as usual, spending this moonless reunion festival</p>
<p>in the refreshing evening breeze.</p>
<h3>Drug Den Cracked Down on Maken Road</h3>
<p>Multiple Chinese and Foreign Customers Arrested</p>
<p>"Our News" On the 26th,</p>
<p>Criminal Police Chief Zhang</p>
<p>Zhang of the North Sichuan Road Police</p>
<p>Station received a tip that</p>
<p>inside No. 37 Maken Road,</p>
<p>some people were consuming drugs and injecting morphine. After Director Wu instructed</p>
<p>an undercover investigation, which confirmed the report, Inspector Li Hua-xuan led officers to the address</p>
<p>for a search, accompanied by the Baojia chief. As a result, they apprehended</p>
<p>Jiang Ji-gen, Jiang Yu-yu, Zhu Gen-fa, and Shen Yu-zhang. In</p>

<p>Wang Yong-gui, and a Canadian foreigner, Frank Ners. A</p>
<p>morphine injection needle and five pills were found on Frank's person.</p>
<p>At this point, all the perpetrators, along with the Baojia</p>
<p>chief, were verified without error, and taken to the bureau with the evidence for interrogation.</p>
<p>According to Jiang Ji-gen, the drugs were purchased from the old street area of Xinwen Road. The investigating</p>
<p>officer took the suspect to No. 15 Wende Li, Xinchang Bridge, where he identified Shi Chang-yuan, and six small packages of drugs were found on his person. He claimed</p>
<p>they were bought from Han Quan-fa, so Han Quan-fa was also arrested, as well as Shi Chang-fa,</p>
<p>who was sitting in the same room, for questioning. Finally, the foreigner Frank</p>
<p>Ners claimed that he came for an evening meal and wine,</p>
<p>and firmly denied any drug use. However, Yao Shen</p>
<p>testified that she personally witnessed him injecting morphine,</p>
<p>and the foreigner lowered his head in silence. As a result of the preliminary hearing,</p>
<p>Jiang Ji-gen, Zhu Gen-fa, Shi Chang-yuan, and Han Quan-fa</p>
<p>were all sent directly to the District Court for special criminal investigation.</p>
<p>As for the remaining foreigner Frank Ners, Shen Yu-zhang,</p>
<p>Wang Yong-gui, Yao Chen, Jiang Yu-yu,</p>
<p>and Quan-fa, were sent to the police hospital for examination</p>
<p>and then processed.</p>

<p>39 years old, from Ningbo, and confiscated over one million yuan in stolen money.</p>
<p>They took him to the bureau for interrogation. He confessed that at 8:30 AM that morning, he and the fugitive surnamed Lu, at</p>

<p>robbed a man's and woman's watch each, a gold ring,</p>

<p>female servants, stuffing their mouths with cotton. They looted at will, and before leaving, they threatened</p>
<p>the victim's family, forbidding them from reporting to the police. The gold pendant, etc., had been sold by Xu and Lu</p>
<p>to Fang Zi-jin Gold and Silver Shop on Huade Road for 6.5 million. Later,</p>

<h3>Four Reasons for Participation: Requesting Reconsideration of the Dance Ban</h3>
<p>A Letter Sent to the City Government for Submission to the Executive Yuan for Approval</p>
<p>"Big News" The</p>
<p>City Council</p>
<p>at this general</p>
<p>meeting made a</p>
<p>resolution on the</p>
<p>dance ban issue:</p>
<p>"The Council will state</p>
<p>the reasons and ask the</p>
<p>Central Government to reconsider</p>
<p>the clear ban on dancing,</p>
<p>and this city requests the</p>
<p>City Government to temporarily suspend</p>
<p>implementation." The Council</p>
<p>has completed</p>
<p>this resolution</p>
<p>yesterday,</p>
<p>sending it to the City Government,</p>
<p>and reporting it to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>for approval. The stated</p>
<p>reasons are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"In order to achieve the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country,</p>
<p>the Central Government called on the national people to practice thrift, which is solemn and righteous.</p>
<p>The Council, representing the citizens of the entire city, is sincerely supporting</p>
<p>it, and all the implementation measures have been tried to help promote it. However,</p>
<p>regarding the prohibition of commercial dance halls, after careful consideration,</p>
<p>it is felt that it is not entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>People have the freedom to choose</p>
<p>occupations and businesses without violating the law. This is the freedom</p>
<p>granted to the people by the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage, and it is also a basic</p>
<p>right that citizens of democratic countries should enjoy. Unless it harms the public interest,</p>
<p>the state may restrict or prohibit it by law.</p>
<p>There has never been a prohibition</p>
<p>on the operation of dance halls.</p>
<p>It has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Only the government has legislation to manage and tax them, and there has never been</p>
<p>an express prohibition, which shows that it is not a business that harms the public</p>
<p>interest. If we consider the Constitution of the Republic of China, which has been promulgated and is urgently</p>
<p>to be implemented, there is no restriction on the legal business of private individuals, so the dance ban seems to limit the freedom of people to engage in legal</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>Dancing is considered a normal entertainment</p>
<p>by all civilized countries in the world, so whether it is for social or international celebrations,</p>
<p>tea dances or dinner dances are common.</p>
<p>The Central Government initially had no prohibition on tea dances or dinner dances.</p>
<p>In that case, dancing is not prohibited in principle, only commercial</p>
<p>dance halls are prohibited.</p>
<p>Dance halls do not hinder thrift</p>
<p>If we take commercial</p>
<p>dance halls as</p>
<p>extravagant and ban them, then in this city, among the</p>
<p>thirty commercial dance halls, what they consume is only</p>
<p>tea, water, fruits, and snacks. Compared to restaurants and eateries with dinner dance facilities,</p>
<p>which consumes more? If we consider that commercial dance halls have</p>
<p>dance hostesses, then the dance hostesses exchange labor for compensation.</p>
<p>Since it does not increase the consumption of materials, it has nothing to do with the meaning of thrift.</p>
<p>And there are far more bad phenomena in society that violate thrift,</p>
<p>disrupt the economy, hinder public morals, and affect order than in dance halls.</p>
<p>Yet, the government has not strictly banned them. Therefore, the dance ban is</p>
<p>too much like abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the trivial in terms of its original intention of thrift.</p>
<p>Unnecessarily Increases the Unemployed</p>
<p>There are thirty</p>
<p>commercial dance halls</p>
<p>in this city, with as many as tens of thousands of employees, and no less than 200,000 people depend on them indirectly for a living.</p>
<p>If they are all banned from operating at once, it will immediately put 200,000 people in a state of unemployment</p>
<p>and starvation, posing a great threat to social stability. During the suppression of the rebellion,</p>
<p>the stability of the rear is no less important than the war on the front lines.</p>
<p>I am deeply afraid that the dance halls will be prohibited in the future. Thrift movements may not fully achieve the desired results, but will only</p>
<p>suddenly increase the number of unemployed people in society, and social security may be affected.</p>
<p>There is a concern that it may make things more complicated.</p>
<p>The Measures Are Still Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>The Council supports</p>
<p>national policy and does not</p>
<p>dare to fall behind, and it is the duty to convey the opinions of the majority of citizens</p>
<p>to the government. As for the phased prohibition measures formulated by the City Government, although they are more lenient, after detailed discussions,</p>
<p>there are still many difficulties and obstacles. According to the Constitution,</p>
<p>the central and local governments should adopt a system of balanced powers.</p>
<p>Those legislated and implemented by the central government are mostly related to national plans and involve matters of national unity. Listing the items and specifying the scope,</p>
<p>given the vastness of our country and the diversity of customs,</p>
<p>for dance halls and other similar types, whether they should be prohibited or not,</p>
<p>it is better to have local authorities take appropriate measures than to have the central government make rigid regulations."</p>
<h3>Assembly Continues to Discuss the Hardoon Garden Case</h3>
<p>"Our News" The City Council's</p>
<p>fourth general assembly will continue to hold its seventh meeting this afternoon</p>
<p>to discuss various important proposals. This</p>
<p>morning, the Council's Public Works Committee</p>
<p>will hold a subcommittee meeting to review</p>
<p>measures for purchasing gasoline.</p>
<p>"Another News" Zhang Nai-zuo, Ma Jun-shuo,</p>
<p>Tao Bai-chuan, and other sixty-odd councilors</p>
<p>jointly proposed that the assembly approve the requisition</p>
<p>of Hardoon Garden on Nanjing West Road as a permanent park for the city</p>
<p>for citizens to relax and play. This afternoon,</p>
<p>at the assembly's seventh meeting, many councilors will propose</p>
<p>that it be put to discussion. The reporter specially visited a</p>
<p>legal expert for this matter, and asked his opinion</p>
<p>on whether the requisition of the garden as a</p>
<p>park has a legal basis. He replied as follows:</p>
<p>(Q) Can private gardens be requisitioned? (A)</p>
<p>The state may requisition privately owned land for public utilities and public health</p>
<p>or other matters where the government co-operates for the purpose of public interest,</p>
<p>in accordance with Articles 208, Section 3, 4, and 9 of the Land Law. (</p>
<p>Q) How should the price of the requisitioned land be determined legally?</p>
<p>(A) For land with legally determined prices, the legally determined</p>
<p>price shall be used. The provisions of Article 239 of the Land Law are very</p>
<p>clear. (Q) What is the legally determined price</p>
<p>of Hardoon Garden at present? (A) 10,000 yuan per mu.</p>
<h3>Hardoon Garden Donating Land to Build a Library Property Cannot Be Sold Temporarily Construction Funds Still a Problem</h3>
<p>"Our News" Recently, a spokesperson for Hardoon &amp; Co. told a reporter:</p>
<p>The City Council previously passed a resolution to lease Hardoon Garden</p>
<p>to open it as a park. At that time, the heirs of the estate politely declined.</p>
<p>Subsequently, after repeated discussions with the City Government, Hardoon &amp; Co. intends to donate 15 mu of land along</p>
<p>Fuxu Road in Hardoon Garden to the City Government, and to build a library on the land. The funds</p>
<p>will be allocated from the charity fund. When Mrs. Hardoon, Luo Jialu, passed away, she designated about 20 mu of real estate in Xiaohuayuan,</p>
<p>Cideri and Cihe Li as a charitable fund. Only after these two properties</p>
<p>are sold can a portion of the proceeds be used to start building</p>
<p>the library. However, since</p>
<p>the victory and repatriation, all real estate owned by Hardoon &amp; Co. has been suspended from registration,</p>
<p>transfer, and reissue of property rights certificates, and is still frozen. Therefore, it cannot be sold.</p>
<p>Also, about 2.7 mu of land in Wufu Lane, Nanjing Road, is also donated to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>It is also said that Hardoon &amp; Co.'s current financial situation is very tight.</p>
<p>Rent is only collected at 3,240 times the pre-war amount, but taxes are numerous and the burden is very</p>
<p>heavy. The adopted sons and daughters of Mrs. Luo Jialing, the heirs of the estate, number more than twenty, all of whom depend on this for a living.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is still debt incurred in 1935 to pay the UK government's inheritance tax, which was valued at 2.8 million yuan at the time.</p>
<p>This huge debt has not been settled to this day, which is expressed with a sense of deep emotion.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Needs New Construction</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper, Ningbo, 27th dispatch" Ningbo is the largest commercial port in Zhejiang, and also the largest import and export port on the southeast coast; Every day, sea</p>
<p>vessels travel to and from Shanghai, transporting seafood, local specialties such as bamboo shoots, lacquer, and bamboo products, and bringing back various industrial manufactured goods. It</p>
<p>was one of the five ports originally opened to trade with Westerners, and has a commercial history of over a hundred years, with a population of over 700,000. In terms of industry, it also has a very</p>
<p>good light industrial base, with thirty or forty large and small factories such as spinning, flour, and head, supplying daily necessities to various places in eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>After the Anti-Japanese War, its vitality has decreased a lot. The population has only 500,000 left, and the number of sea vessels traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo has decreased from seven to three,</p>
<p>clearly indicating the decline of commerce; in terms of industry, take Ningbo's largest He Feng Spinning Mill as an example: the number of spindles has decreased from 26,000 before the war to the current 6,000, employing only 400 workers, producing fourteen pieces of 20-count coarse yarn per day, and selling it to Wenzhou and Hefei to weave</p>
<p>homespun cloth.</p>
<p>Although this is the case, in the current situation of universal economic recession,</p>
<p>Ningbo is still a vibrant</p>
<p>commercial city, and the local</p>
<p>authorities are also quite committed to making the city prosperous.</p>
<p>This spring, when the reporter passed by Xikou,</p>
<p>Ningbo still looked very dilapidated.</p>
<p>It was not apparent that there was any recovery;</p>
<p>but six months later, when the reporter returned to Ningbo, the</p>
<p>first new impression was that most of the roads had been leveled.</p>
<p>The main thoroughfares</p>
<p>have been repaved with asphalt.</p>
<p>Tung trees have also been planted</p>
<p>on both sides of East Street, making it even grander than Shanghai's</p>
<p>Fei Road. The reason why they</p>
<p>were able to carry out such a large-scale repair is that the</p>
<p>shops along the road were willing to donate hundreds of thousands of yuan</p>
<p>to cover the expenses. This would be difficult to do in Hangzhou;</p>
<p>from this, we can also see that the economic</p>
<p>situation of the people in Ningbo is relatively good. Moreover, Ningbo</p>
<p>also has public prostitutes and back alleys. The brothels</p>
<p>in the Cangshui Street area are doing better than before the war. In the hotels and tea houses,</p>
<p>the waiter always has a list of first and second-class "</p>
<p>famous flowers" available, and house calls by phone are very convenient.</p>
<p>Wealthy merchants and tycoons spend three million yuan</p>
<p>on a table of flower wine, without any stinginess—Ningbo</p>
<p>, can you say it's not doing well?</p>
<p>But tearing open this layer of luxurious decoration,</p>
<p>and looking at its inner layer, we can't be optimistic.</p>
<p>A fellow businessman from Ningbo told me that before the war,</p>
<p>shops in Ningbo had a lot of inventory stored in warehouses,</p>
<p>but now they can only decorate the storefronts.</p>
<p>Some of the display windows are not even full!</p>
<p>This shows the emptiness within the merchants.</p>
<p>A county councilor shouted loudly in the council: "Today, civil servants are on strike,</p>
<p>tomorrow, the dung collectors are making trouble. This clearly shows the</p>
<p>instability of society"! And this also shows</p>
<p>the economic difficulties of the general public.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Chen Youhua said to the reporter very seriously: "The people of Ningbo are simple and unadorned, diligent</p>
<p>and thrifty." This is certainly the "magic weapon" for the people of Ningbo to start a business, and it is also the reason why there are</p>
<p>few entertainment venues in Ningbo City and no coffee shops</p>
<p>or tea houses on the streets; but economic factors</p>
<p>are probably also an important reason. The number of beggars in Ningbo</p>
<p>also clearly shows the economic recession in society.</p>
<p>Fishing Center</p>
<p>Ningbo's fish market has essentially become the center of the entire province. Zhejiang's fishing areas</p>
<p>Four major products -</p>
<p>large and small yellow croaker, squid and ribbonfish - and</p>
<p>other seafood are concentrated in Ningbo and Shenjiamen.</p>
<p>In Ningbo, 70% of the fish products are transported to Shanghai and then sold to various parts of the country; 10% are transported to</p>
<p>Yuyao and Shaoxing via inland rivers, and 20% are retained in the</p>
<p>city to supply the citizens. In addition to fish products, Ningbo's</p>
<p>grain was originally also exported. But when the reporter arrived in Ningbo, a ban had just been issued, because there had been</p>
<p>insect plagues this autumn. According to the county government's statistics, the loss of late rice in each</p>
<p>township reached 70%, as much as 90%. Therefore, except for special concessions for neighboring counties lacking grain, exports</p>
<p>were completely prohibited. However, Taifeng Flour Mill produces 100 bags of flour per day, and under the</p>
<p>circumstances that traffic in North China is inconvenient and commercial transportation is blocked, large quantities are transported to Shanghai. This is a phenomenon that has only occurred after the war.</p>
<p>Speaking of public utilities, Ningbo people often</p>
<p>take pride in them. In fact, they are indeed doing</p>
<p>well. For example, Ningbo has sufficient electricity,</p>
<p>and the telephone service is very reliable. Although it is manually connected, it is</p>
<p>more reliable and faster than Shanghai's automatic telephone.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the drinking water is always</p>
<p>too bad and always salty. Soon, a trial run of urban public</p>
<p>buses will be carried out by the Yin Chuan Company on the section from Jiangdong to the western suburbs; the new</p>
<p>Jiang Bridge, which connects the Jiangdong and Jiangbei districts, is also being worked on for repair and reinforcement. I deeply</p>
<p>hope that the people of Ningbo will more actively exert their traditional spirit of "diligence, thrift and hard work"</p>
<p>to push Ningbo towards a more modern path.</p>
<p>Because Ningbo does not have a housing shortage, housing does not require a premium, and rent is also lower than in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The premium for shop houses is at most tens of millions; and the public security in the city</p>
<p>is very good, making it a place where people can</p>
<p>live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Some local gentry</p>
<p>want to develop the Dongqian Lake in the eastern district, decorating a</p>
<p>country girl in a fashionable manner, hoping</p>
<p>to compete with Hangzhou's West Lake to beautify the city.</p>
<p>In fact, I think a city should have</p>
<p>its own characteristics. For over a hundred years, Ningbo</p>
<p>has had a considerable industrial and commercial foundation. In the future, when the Hangyong Railway is built and the</p>
<p>entire Huhangyong Railway is restored,</p>
<p>it will be located at the transportation hub by sea and land, and its prosperity is sure to come soon. Why bother to build</p>
<p>a scenic area too far from the city? Currently, the focus should be</p>
<p>on academic culture, so that future</p>
<p>Ningbo will not have too much money-grubbing and</p>
<p>appear empty in its spiritual life. Museums</p>
<p>and libraries have been destroyed and no longer exist; the world-famous "Tianyi Pavilion"</p>
<p>also has rare books, but they are hidden and not used;</p>
<p>the school buildings of Advanced Industrial School, Eastern Zhejiang,</p>
<p>Zhengshi and other secondary schools have been damaged and have not yet been restored; all this indicates</p>
<p>that there is a need for major construction in culture. And this kind of need</p>
<p>is as important as repairing roads and opening public motor vehicles.</p>

<h3>Publication of the Complete Collection of Financial Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The government promulgated numerous financial laws and regulations before and during the war. Among them, many have been revised or become outdated, causing inconvenience for people to search and consult. Recently, the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, recognizing this issue, organized and compiled a "Complete Collection of Financial Laws and Regulations," which was published by the Commercial Press. It includes over three hundred wartime laws and regulations, and all currently effective financial laws and regulations are listed. It is available in both hardcover and paperback editions, it is said.</p>
<h3>General Overview of China's Sausage Casing Industry - Survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Department</h3>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The export of Chinese sausage casings dates back to the late Qing Dynasty. Initially, Russians bought them in the Tianjin area of North China and shipped them abroad. Germans then began purchasing them, establishing factories in cities such as Shanghai and Hankou to process and cure them. Later, the scope of procurement widened daily, and sales also expanded. Merchants from countries like Britain, the United States, and France also followed suit. Chinese people then competed to imitate them, setting up their own factories, presenting a vigorous scene for a time. However, since Chinese businessmen were unfamiliar with export business and found it difficult to find foreign counterparts, the finished sausage casings were all resold to foreign firms. Payments were made in domestic currency, so there was no way to easily obtain foreign exchange. After the establishment of domestic companies engaged in direct export, foreign trade in sausage casings gradually became important, and the business of foreign firms involved in sausage casings gradually decreased, recently accounting for only one or two tenths.</p>
<p>II. Types of Sausage Casings</p>
<p>Sausage casings can be divided into three types: pork casings, beef casings, and sheep casings. Pork and sheep casings are cured with salt and then packed in wooden barrels for export. Beef casings must be dried in the sun and sprinkled with pepper powder before being packed in wooden boxes with lead lining for export. The production quantity of beef and sheep casings is not large, while pork casings are more common and account for the majority of sausage casing exports. The term "sausage casing" usually refers to pork casings. The areas where pork casings are concentrated for curing and export are Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other ports.</p>
<p>III. Quality of Pork Casings</p>
<p>The finer the color of pork casings (i.e., the diameter), the better. According to size standards, they are generally divided into large and small. From 24 mm to 36 mm, 24 mm to 34 mm are considered small strips, and 34 mm to 36 mm and above are considered large strips. Small strips are the superior grade, and large strips are the inferior grade. Quality and color are also related. The best quality is those without damage, and the best color is reddish. Light red and pinkish-white are next best, while yellow and black are the worst. Pork casings produced in the suburbs of Shanghai, along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, and in southern Anhui are of very good quality. They are thin-skinned and clean, and the diameter is even and small. Except for the color, which is not as tender as American sausage casings, other aspects are admired by countries around the world. Sausage casings produced in provinces such as Hunan and Henan are mostly thick-skinned and have sinews, while those produced in the east are thick-skinned and have coarse sinews, so the quality is inferior.</p>
<p>IV. Number of Processing Factories</p>
<p>There are 59 sausage casing curing factories and workshops in Shanghai that have joined the trade association. Among them, 41 are workshops and 18 are factories, including 5 foreign-owned factories. Eleven factories are engaged in export business. Each factory has a workforce ranging from over 20 to over 10 workers. Each sausage casing workshop employs about three to four workers. The number of workers in each factory and workshop varies depending on the peak and off seasons.</p>
<p>V. Processing Volume</p>
<p>About 10,000 barrels of sausage casings were cured in the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], about 2,000 barrels in the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], and about 1,500 barrels in the first half of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947].</p>
<p>VI. Processing Procedures</p>
<p>Pork casings exported from Shanghai can be divided into two types: salted and dried. The sources can be divided into two types: fresh and raw. The details are as follows: Shanghai has a dense population, and pork accounts for the majority of meat supply and demand. Three-quarters of the pig intestines slaughtered daily are given to sausage casing factories for processing into sausage casings. After the fresh intestines enter the factory, they are soaked in water for 24 hours and then removed. They are scraped with a rectangular bamboo piece to remove fat and other impurities, and then rinsed several times with clean water to make them clean inside and out. Then they are soaked in a vat again for about 24 hours until the casing is milky or slightly reddish. They are then taken out, bleached, and dried. The length and diameter are measured, and they are tied up separately.</p>
<p>The length of each salted casing is 13.5 yards, and at most three strips are tied together. Fine salt is added. The next day, they are tied into bundles by hand and placed in a flat-bottomed bamboo basket. Each basket can hold 200 bundles. The bamboo baskets are stacked and pressed heavily to reduce moisture and make it easier to pack into barrels. Each barrel contains 2,500 or 1,250 bundles, and fine salt or more saltpeter is added to each casing. Then the barrel is covered, nailed firmly, and the barrel packing procedure is completed.</p>
<p>The method of making raw goods is similar to that of fresh goods, but the salt used before they are shipped to Shanghai from places such as Rugao, Taixing, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou in Jiangsu, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, Lanxi, Shaoxing in Zhejiang, Wuhu, Bengbu, Hefei, Anqing in Anhui, Jiujiang in Jiangxi, and Chongqing in Sichuan, is of poor quality. The goods are rough and black, and some are mixed with alum, which discolors the casings and is not very popular with sausage casing merchants. Therefore, after being shipped to Shanghai, they must be further processed before being packed into barrels for export.</p>
<p>The method of making dried casings is similar to that of salted casings, but no salt is used. After scraping and bleaching, they are dried in the sun, then flattened, and sorted by length and diameter for packing into wooden boxes for export.</p>
<p>Beef casings can also be divided into two types: salted and dried. First, the small and large intestines of cattle are soaked in clear water for about 24 hours. Then they are washed and scraped to remove all fat and other tissues, and then rinsed clean with clear water. Then they are submerged in a large amount of clear water. The next day, they are scraped and washed again. The casings are inflated to check for breaks. Damaged ones are eliminated, and the intact ones are dried in the sun. Pepper powder is sprinkled, and they are flattened. Each casing is about 20 meters long, and ten casings are tied together and packed into a lead-lined wooden box, about 20 bundles per box. The method of making salted beef casings is the same as that of salted pork casings.</p>
<p>Sheep casings are only made with salt. The method is similar to that of salted pork casings. The packaging is 500 bundles per barrel, with 3 casings per bundle, and up to 6 strips per casing. The length is about 34 yards.</p>
<p>VII. Export Volume</p>
<p>Before the war, the total annual export volume of sausage casings was about 10,000 barrels, with about 4,500 barrels exported from Shanghai, about 3,500 barrels exported from Hankou and Chongqing, and about 2,000 barrels exported from Tianjin and Qingdao. The distribution of overseas markets is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Northern European countries (including Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Czech Republic, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, etc.) about 6,000 barrels per year.</p>
<p>2. Mediterranean countries (including France, Italy, Spain, and Balkan countries) about 1,500 barrels per year.</p>
<p>3. The United Kingdom and its territories (including South Africa) about 500 barrels per year.</p>
<p>4. The United States about 2,000 barrels per year.</p>
<p>From the victory to the end of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], the total export volume of the country was about 2,000 barrels, of which 60% were pre-war inventories and 40% were those collected and processed after the victory. Among them, about 1,300 barrels were shipped to the United States and about 700 barrels were shipped to Europe.</p>
<p>VIII. Current Difficulties</p>
<p>After the victory in the autumn of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], overseas selling prices were originally very low, but they could barely cover costs. This year, due to foreign exchange rates, exporting a barrel incurs a maximum loss of 40%. Recently, due to rampant smuggling in South China, Hong Kong, which previously had no sausage casing exports, is now secretly the center of sausage casing exports, resulting in a further decline in overseas selling prices. For example, in the United States, the price per bundle (two casings, 27 yards long) was about 90 US cents in the spring of this year, but is now as low as 33 US cents. In Switzerland, the price has also fallen from over 1.8 Swiss francs per casing to just over 70 cents, which has a huge impact on exports. On the cost side, due to increased salt taxes, the cost per barrel has increased by about 700,000 yuan. Other expenses have also increased due to the general rise in labor and commodity prices, making exports increasingly difficult. In addition, the price of pig intestines is currently based on the price of pork. In the past, the purchase price of sausage casings per casing (13.5 yards long) was equivalent to the market price of one catty of fresh meat. The price of meat in rural areas was lower than in commercial cities, so the price of pig intestines was naturally cheaper, so the villagers were happy to buy them. Fresh intestines were transported to cities, sold to sausage casing factories for curing and export. Now, the price of meat has risen to over 10,000 yuan, while the price of fresh intestines per casing is still less than 5,000 yuan. Moreover, due to transportation and other difficulties, villagers are unwilling to transport them, or sell them locally as fertilizer, or use them as food. If the purchase price is not increased, the processing volume of sausage casing factories cannot be increased and will decrease day by day.</p>

<h3>On Medical Talents</h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>The most popular saying nowadays is, "Incompetent doctors kill people," and "Failing to rescue the dying." But, thinking calmly, our hospitals are indeed inefficient in "saving people." In fact, the entire country feels the lack of scientific medical talents. This is not just a problem for hospitals, but a serious problem facing the country.</p>
<p>Why do we feel a lack of scientific medical talent? There are many reasons for this, and it is difficult to explain in a few words. But the most fundamental reason is that medical administration and medical education are not on the right track. At the same time, society has not formed an environment for cultivating scientific medical talent. Because of this, many geniuses cannot advance rapidly, many public health doctors cannot realize their ambitions, and many useful doctors are abandoned in useless places. If this factor is not changed, the health of the nation cannot be transformed, public health undertakings cannot be promoted, and the future of scientific medicine has absolutely no hope. Therefore, increasing scientific medical talent is a fundamental issue for the prosperity of the country and the health of the nation. We must conduct a thorough exploration and objective research. We know that the development of a career is related to talent, and talent is mostly cultivated successfully. International cultivation is effective, and talents are naturally born in large numbers. Promotion is timely, so outstanding individuals emerge. Confucius said, "In a village of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy people." Today, the decline of scientific medicine in our country is not because there is no talent, but because talent is not being used properly. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "Everyone should be given their due," and also said, "If cultivation is done right, then Heaven will not waste talent; if encouragement is proper, then the wild will not suppress talent; if employment is lawful, then the court will not have mediocre officials." These are truly excellent words and good strategies for governing the world. Unfortunately, the current medical community emphasizes idols and qualifications, while neglecting talent, resulting in the burying of many outstanding talents. This is because cultivation is not being done properly. After the commercialization of medicine, there is an emphasis on making money and neglecting function, resulting in the loss of medical ethics and the degradation of medical practices. This is because encouragement is improper. Furthermore, colleagues in the medical community often prioritize personal relationships and factions, resulting in a relative weakening of strength. This is because employment is not lawful. How can we talk about proper cultivation with such medical administration and medical education?</p>
<p>Speaking of our health administration, it prioritizes personal relationships and neglects righteousness, or forms groups of fellow villagers and classmates, advancing and retreating based on personal interests, and all actions are wrong. Such people only know factions and do not ask about virtue or stupidity, causing those with aspirations for public health to have the mindset of short-term officials. As a result, doctors have no ambition to be loyal to their duties. Therefore, those who serve in public health agencies are only solving their livelihood, and have no empathy for patients. In addition, there are conflicts of interest among individuals. Struggles in the school system, environmental constraints, and mutual attacks result in harm to patients. This fragmented situation leads to social criticism. Everyone points the finger at scientific medicine as being incompetent doctors, and public hospitals as being murderous slaughterhouses. Criticism and complaints are everywhere. Such a painful lesson is unbearable to speak of. If people in our medical community do not change course, then public health undertakings will inevitably perish together.</p>
<p>The current trend is all influenced by money, so even doctors with noble benevolence and medical skills have to strive for profit, flatter, shirk responsibility, be servile, and smile obsequiously. This is also the passivity caused by the bureaucratization of our medicine, and it is a scourge of our scientific medicine. The scientific medical community has such villains, which will inevitably lead to a lack of enthusiasm for service, and medical treatment will not be satisfactory, and misleading patients will be their forte. Like this, it is very dangerous for both public and private. As the old saying goes, like attracts like. If our medical community continues to emphasize striving for profit and welcomes flattery and adulation, then good doctors and public health doctors will inevitably protect themselves wisely, while greedy and mediocre doctors will certainly seek undeserved advancement. Like this, scientific medicine in our country will not have hope at all. Therefore, we should denounce them loudly.</p>
<p>We know that worshiping idols and emphasizing qualifications may have its own value in peaceful and prosperous times. But, at the beginning of this turbulent national construction, it seems that we should not overemphasize them. What day is today? It is a time of national crisis and low national health. If public medical care only possesses empty fame and cannot match the name with reality and seek happiness for the people, then the people of the world will forever be sinners of the nation. Since our country has had health institutions, from the central to the provincial and municipal health officials, each has their own merits regarding the quality of health administration. What is regrettable is that our country has undergone the historical War of Resistance, and health and medicine have failed to nurture new and outstanding talents. Is it really that there are no good talents, or is it that the authorities have not properly promoted and entrusted them with important tasks? The young people who joined the health work during the eight years of the War of Resistance are now over forty years old. Among them, there may be many with loyalty and ingenuity, and the skills to bring the dying back to life. If we can use their strengths, promote them, entrust them with important tasks, give them hope, and grant them power to increase their prestige, then there must be those among them who can "send out great talents to overcome difficulties" and establish a long-term foundation. The power of British, American, and Soviet medicine today is due to the strong economic and scientific foundations of their countries, and the biggest factor is the abundance of new talents. In the future, if scientific medicine is to develop, first of all, we must reverse the declining medical ethics, emphasize integrity, and then the path of villains will be eliminated, and if we choose the virtuous and capable, then there will be no abandoned talents in the wild. This is what Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Everyone should be given their due," with the heart of serving the world, opening the path to selecting the virtuous and capable, so that scientific medicine can be brought back to life.</p>
<h3>Talking About Improving Utensil Lids from a Physiological Hygiene Perspective</h3>
<p>— Baizhi</p>
<p>Why do we need lids for bowls, pots, jars, cups, and other utensils for holding food? Needless to say, the purpose is to ensure the cleanliness of the food and prevent the intrusion of dust and various unclean substances. But times are different, knowledge has expanded, and the concepts and types of so-called unclean substances have also changed somewhat. And the various lid styles designed by previous generations are now somewhat unsuitable for practical use, and there is a need for improvement.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the types of unclean substances first. According to the minds of people in previous times, the unclean substances that could invade food in jars, bowls, and other utensils were nothing more than dust falling from above and sand blown by strong winds. As for flies gathering and eating, it was not considered unclean. A wave of the hand to drive away flies and gnats, and then picking up the food and putting it into the mouth and swallowing it into the stomach was no big deal. Now, that's not okay. We know that flies and gnats carry the danger of spreading typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and various other germs. Because flies and gnats like to gather and eat feces. The feces of typhoid patients, the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients, and the stool of dysentery patients all have a rich abundance of germs. Flies and gnats are very fond of having a banquet there. Once they are there, their feet, wings, and mouths are contaminated with many germs. They carry many germs and fly to the banquet, like bombers loaded with bombs, flying over our heads. The places they land on are contaminated with many germs. They take one step and contaminate one step, take two steps and contaminate two steps, like Pan Fei's lotus feet, leaving fragrant footprints. If they land on food and drink, they contaminate the food and drink. If they crawl on utensils, they contaminate the utensils. If they stop on the table, they contaminate the table. I often see them liking to land on the edge of cups and dishes, stop for a moment, and like to circle around the rim. Like soldiers guarding the city, circling on the city wall. As a result, the rim of this cup or dish is contaminated by them. Especially flies, after eating their fill of filth, swarm to clean places, and like to spit out a little filth, and spot this clean place. In summer, white clothes often have a stain for no reason. This is the filth spit out by flies. Ancient people only knew that flies could stain white clothes, but they never said that flies stained food and drink. Therefore, the fact that flies and gnats can cause food and drink to be unclean was not noticed in the minds of ancient people.</p>
<p>There are also the nasal secretions of people with stomach problems, and the phlegm of people with tuberculosis, especially the phlegm of people with laryngeal tuberculosis, all of which contain many pathogens. Once they are coughed and spat out, they fly in the air with tiny droplets and fall on food and drink, cups, dishes, and tables, which will also contaminate food and drink, cups, dishes, and tables. This kind of unclean substance was also not noticed in the minds of ancient people.</p>
<p>Now I will criticize the kinds of lids of the utensils holding food that are commonly seen every day, using diagrams to illustrate them, and then other types can be inferred by analogy.</p>
<p>The lid shown in the picture is the most common. The lids for bowls of rice and side dishes are all like this. This is the most unreasonable lid. It leaves the rim of the bowl exposed. All kinds of unclean substances can easily contaminate it. Whether it is dust, sand, flies and gnats, or sneeze and cough droplets, they can all fall on it. Moreover, this lid has a domed back. If liquid unclean substances fall on the back of the lid or the inner edge of the bowl, they can directly flow into the bowl and contaminate the food and drink. Even if we exclude liquid unclean substances, the unclean substances that are contaminated on the rim of the bowl by flies and coughs will also fall into the bowl when the lid is opened. If the bowl contains liquid drinks such as soup, when we pick it up or use a spoon to stir it, the liquid will also move upwards to the contaminated area and be contaminated. Moreover, we often put our mouths to the rim of the bowl, to the contaminated area of the rim, and the unclean substances will enter our bodies and intestines.</p>
<p>This kind of lid is often seen on teacups, and it is much better than the first type. Unclean substances will not contaminate the rim of the cup, nor will they directly enter the cup. There is also no danger in drinking tea with our mouths to the rim of the cup. But there is one very important thing to note! That is, when this kind of lid is lifted, you must not put the lid on the table casually, you must turn it over, and make the back of the lid touch the table, and teach it to lie on its back. Because the surface of the table is difficult to protect without contamination of unclean things, if you do not turn the lid over and put it on the table, then the belly side of the lid will touch the table, and there will be the possibility of pollution. When you go to cover the cup again, it will contaminate the rim of the cup and the drink in the cup.</p>
<p>This kind of lid is the best. The unclean objects on the outside will neither invade the rim of the dish and the drink food in the dish, nor can it be opened and placed arbitrarily on the table. Even if the rim of the lid is contaminated by unclean objects on the table, fortunately it covers the outside of the dish and will not spread to the inside of the dish. We use this method to do pure culture of bacteria. I think all kinds of utensils for holding food should be made with this type, almost to ensure the safety and cleanliness of food and drink. Especially at the turn of summer and autumn, when cholera, dysentery and other acute gastrointestinal diseases are prevalent, you have to be very careful.</p>
<h3>Reading Medical Notes (1) New Uses for Color Blind People</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>When we doctors examine people's physiques, we always have to check whether that person has color blindness. If there is color blindness, then most of these color blind people will not be admitted, because color blind people cannot distinguish between red and green, which can often cause many problems in public affairs. As for traffic management, those color blind people are even more inadmissible. However, in this Second World War, the US military actually massively recruited this group of color blind people and placed them in the aviation field. This is truly a strange thing. But to be blunt, it is not strange at all, because although that group of color blind people cannot distinguish between red and green, they have a strong ability to distinguish between natural colors and camouflaged colors, whether it is a city or a military stronghold, as long as there are camouflaged facilities, they can immediately distinguish them. Germany's city camouflage techniques were very clever, and British and American pilots were often fooled, but since employing color blind people, they can immediately distinguish the camouflaged areas, and as a result, German cities were greatly destroyed. Although the world today cannot be said to be peaceful or at war, color blind people are temporarily unemployed.</p>
<p>However, because color blind people are good at identifying the levels of pigments, perhaps they will be able to develop their ability to identify the authenticity of ancient paintings in the future.</p>
<p>A New Method of Treating Trachoma with Sulfa Drugs.</p>
<p>We have long known that trachoma can be treated internally with Sulfanilamide tablets or other sulfa drugs. Many magazines have long reported its many effects. But because its toxicity is too high, it not only irritates the stomach and intestines, but also destroys red blood cells too severely, so many doctors are always hesitant to try it. Some doctors want to make sulfanilamide into an ointment and apply it directly to the affected area of trachoma, but because of its excessive irritant properties, it is often extremely painful, and often causes the eyelids to swell, so ophthalmologists dare not use it either. Now, after many studies, we know that using 12% sulfanilamide ointment can reduce many irritations. If you wash the affected area with 3% boric acid water before applying this ointment, then it will be even more harmless.</p>
<h3>The Importance and Treatment of Whooping Cough</h3>
<p>— Shou Wuqing</p>
<p>Currently, coughing is prevalent, and there are many child sufferers in the neighborhoods. Among them, besides colds and flu, there are quite a few whooping cough patients. Whooping cough is also known as "百日咳 or 癨咳" because when coughing, there is always thick, sticky phlegm, resembling the saliva of a domestic bird, expelled from the mouth. It's also called "天哮咳" because during frequent and severe coughing, the patient gasps for air, stretches their neck upwards, and takes a deep, long breath to relieve the distress of persistent coughing and wheezing.</p>
<p>Whooping cough is one of the infectious diseases of children, and uninfected adults are also susceptible. Schools, organizations, nurseries, cinemas, parks, and neighborhoods are all places where the disease can spread, and homes are particularly close-knit exchange points for the disease. Therefore, within a family, it is common for three or four siblings to suffer from the disease at the same time. Their coughs sound like thunder, continuous and uninterrupted, and the illness lasts for quite a long time, disturbing people's peaceful sleep, and causing parents to dislike it.</p>
<p>Whooping cough is highly contagious. The source of the disease is the whooping cough bacillus, which is transmitted through the droplets ejected during coughing. Healthy children within a four-foot radius of infected children are generally at risk of infection. From the time the bacteria enter the body to the initial onset of the disease, it takes about one to two weeks. The symptoms can be divided into three stages.</p>
<p>The first stage involves symptoms like a cold, such as coughing, a red throat, a runny nose, a slight fever or no fever, a normal appetite, and no special systemic symptoms, lasting for about two weeks. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Habits of Desert Animals</h3>
<p>— Guanchao</p>
<p>Deserts are barren lands, with little water and no trees, only sparse shrubs or weeds dotting the vast expanse of sand. Animals need water and food, so deserts are not suitable places for animal life. In other words, it is difficult for animals to live in desert regions. However, in reality, the animals in the desert are not as simple or as rare as we imagine.</p>
<p>To explain this phenomenon, let's start with the general characteristics of desert plants. Desert plants have two special features: plants that grow in the desert generally have very short stems and trunks, reduced leaf surfaces, or even completely degenerate leaves, making them difficult to identify. The most common form is thorns, such as the many thorns of cacti, which is a good example. This special characteristic is naturally the result of the lack of water in the soil and the plant's need to reduce evaporation. In addition, we must pay attention to the special distribution of desert plants. Desert plants are never like the green grass of the grasslands or the dense foliage of the forests, obscuring the sky. Instead, they are scattered among the sand and stones, like stars scattered across the sky. This sparse distribution is not necessarily due to the uneven distribution of underground water in the desert. In other words, the existence of plants on the surface does not necessarily indicate the presence of water underground. Conversely, the absence of plants on the surface does not necessarily indicate the absence of water underground. We must understand that although the above-ground parts of desert plants are reduced, their root systems are often very developed, extending in all directions underground to a considerable distance to absorb water. Many shrubs store large amounts of water within their plant tissues, such as cacti, which are particularly rich in water storage. These water-storing plants satisfy their own physiological needs, but humans or animals often rely on them as the only source of water in the desert.</p>
<p>Besides these water-storing shrubs, in desert areas that do not rain for years or only have slight rain once or twice a year, there are often plants with extremely short lifespans. These plants grow quickly, flower, and bear fruit when there is sufficient rain. They complete their life cycle in a short period of time. When it is dry, they wither, leaving the underground parts, which can grow again when it rains. These plants generally have fleshy leaves and fleshy fruits. Because of their short lifespan and rapid growth, they do not exhibit the scattered distribution of shrubs.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned plants have methods to adapt to their special environment, so they grow quite well and are distributed relatively abundantly, providing the only food and water supply for animals. There are also some animals that do not need to drink water, relying only on the water content of their food and the dew that collects on it. Rodents like the red-necked gazelle, or many insects and other invertebrates, are probably like this.</p>
<p>A few desert areas are completely dry and completely lack springs or water holes. The rare rain, or only rain in small areas, sometimes creates temporary rivers, but they only last for a few hours or days. Some large deserts are surrounded by high mountains, and the water from the rivers can often flow a considerable distance and seep into the sand. This water that seeps into the sand can only be absorbed by plants or drawn by people from wells to supply water to animals that need to drink or need a lot of water. However, these water sources are not long-term or permanent, only limited to a certain period. Therefore, animals that need more water must have special adaptive habits to survive. Many animals can store water in their bodies. When there is a water source, they drink a lot of water, which can last for a considerable period of time. For example, the camel, which we are familiar with, can store water in the tissues of its stomach. This is a good example. Camels are very common in the deserts of Africa, Arabia, and Mongolia. The Mongolian species have two humps, while the others have only one. They are the most important means of transportation in the desert. Sometimes their owners rely on them to supply milk and water as food for long journeys. In addition, many reptiles that live in the desert can also store water in their organs or body cavities. For example, the desert tortoise in Colorado can live in extremely dry places, sometimes existing sixty miles from a water source. It can be said that they can live in places where other animals cannot live. Some lizards can also store large amounts of water in their bodies. Locals often use them as drinking water, so they are an important source of water in dry areas. There are also amphibians that generally need humid air and watery habitats because their eggs and tadpoles must grow in water. However, the Australian water-holding frog (Chiroleptes) is different from ordinary frogs. It can store water in its body cavity and live in burrows. The water emitted by the frog's body creates humid air in the burrow. Locals often obtain drinking water from them. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Minor Inventions</h3>
<p>— Zhao Nan</p>
<p>Machine for Washing Fish</p>
<p>A new type of scaling machine weighing four and a half tons can clean ten large fish per minute. The fish are placed in the machine and automatically pass through five pairs of rotating brushes to scrape off the scales, and then pass through a narrow slit, and the fish are cleaned. Small fish washing machines are being manufactured competitively by various factories.</p>
<p>Airborne Typewriter</p>
<p>American Bell Telephone Co. recently designed an airborne typewriter weighing only thirty-five pounds. In addition to a sophisticated standard typewriter, this airborne typewriter also has a switching management machine. The switching management machine converts the code into audio frequency, so it can be transmitted using the existing radio equipment on the aircraft. The receiver on the ground then converts the audio frequency back into a code, creating electrical impulse, which is then typed directly and identically on a corresponding typewriter.</p>
<p>Fluorescent Vacuum Needle</p>
<p>The total number of molecules in a unit volume can be indicated by the color displayed on the fluorescent screen of the fluorescent vacuum needle. This instrument is twelve inches long, wide, and four and a half inches high, and can immediately indicate the working condition of the vacuum mechanism.</p>
<p>Five-in-One Tachometer</p>
<p>An instrument that measures the speed of rotation of a wheel is called a tachometer. A new type of tachometer can measure the speeds of five different rotating machines. The rotational speed ranges from one to five thousand r.p.m. (revolutions per second) and can be read directly.</p>
<p>Radar "Policeman"</p>
<p>If a car's speed exceeds the prescribed rate, it will be punished. A new instrument, based on the principle of radar, can immediately indicate whether the speeding car in front has exceeded the prescribed rate, with a very accurate degree of accuracy, with only a two percent error. The instrument weighs forty-five pounds and requires only a six-volt storage battery or a one-hundred-and-twenty-volt alternating current to control it.</p>
<p>New Magnet</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has invented a new magnetic alloy that is said to be able to hold three hundred times its weight in iron blocks. It is tentatively named Magnet Gold 627, and it is extracted from oil wells more than four thousand nine hundred feet deep.</p>
<p>All-Steel Motor</p>
<p>American Elliott Co. recently manufactured an all-steel welded large motor that is not only extremely strong but also very refined and compact, reducing one-tenth of the weight and one-quarter of the volume. The efficiency of the cooling equipment is also extremely high. The bracket and body of the all-steel motor are coated with stainless steel, which is bright.</p>
<p>Leakage Control Device for Underground Metals</p>
<p>According to recent studies, corrosion of underground metals is caused by electrolysis due to the passage of current. To prevent this corrosion, a new design is about to be completed. At the same time, if there is a leakage of electricity on the wire, it is often dangerous. This new instrument, including sensitive current and voltage components, can allow the leakage to escape without danger.</p>
<h3>Rocket Fuel</h3>
<p>— Kai</p>
<p>There are two main types of rocket fuel: solid fuel and liquid fuel. The former is nothing more than ordinary smokeless gunpowder, which is not easy to control and requires a very large combustion chamber, making it unsuitable for rockets. Therefore, current research on rocket fuel is focused on liquid fuel. Of course, everyone believes that the most ideal driving force—atomic energy—is also the best fuel for rockets, but it is still far from practical application, so let's not discuss it for now. Therefore, this article will focus on introducing some liquid fuels for rockets.</p>
<p>Before getting to the main topic, let's first talk about what is the most suitable fuel for rockets. We know that the movement of a rocket is due to the reaction force generated by the gas being ejected backward at extremely high speeds. According to Newton's laws of mechanics, the force on the rocket is: F = MC, where M is the mass of the gas ejected per unit time, and C is the speed at which the gas is ejected. However, a rocket has a limited amount of fuel, so the quality of the fuel depends on the speed at which the gas is ejected from the fuel. At the same time, we should also know that the temperature of the rocket's combustion chamber reaches as high as six thousand degrees Fahrenheit. Under this high temperature, many situations and chemical changes are very different from normal. We must relearn many things.</p>
<p>For example, at room temperature, the power produced by burning liquid oxygen and gasoline together is greater than that of liquid oxygen and alcohol. However, in the high temperature of the rocket's combustion chamber, the opposite is true. Therefore, the German V-2 rocket used the latter two fuels.</p>
<p>At high temperatures, decomposition (Dissociation) occurs, which hinders the combustion of the fuel. If the combustion is not complete, it will affect the pressure and ejection speed of the gas. Compounds containing oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen, such as alcohol, generate gas at six thousand degrees Fahrenheit. According to calculations and experimental results, the maximum speed is only eight thousand feet per second, which of course cannot meet our requirements.</p>
<p>Targeting this phenomenon, American scientists used liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, which have higher binding power. Sure enough, this increased the ejection speed to twelve thousand feet per second. However, according to common chemical knowledge, we know that oxygen and fluorine have a strong binding force. They can quickly synthesize hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the dark at low temperatures, and they are not easily separated at high temperatures. Scientists thought of it, believing that if liquid fluorine and hydrogen were used as fuel, better results could be obtained. At the same time, there is another factor that makes liquid fluorine and hydrogen more suitable as rocket fuel than oxygen and hydrogen, which is specific gravity.</p>
<p>Rockets have a huge volume, of which fuel accounts for three-quarters, so for economic reasons, it is more appropriate to carry fuel with a higher specific gravity. Based on this principle, we can calculate:</p>
<p>Each part of oxygen must be combined with two parts of hydrogen to synthesize one part of water, and the atomic weight of oxygen is sixteen, while hydrogen is one, so if liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are used as fuel, then the weight of the oxygen carried is heavier than hydrogen, which should be eight to one. Similarly, if liquid fluorine and liquid hydrogen are used as fuel, then the fluorine is nine times heavier than hydrogen. Everyone knows that oxygen is the lightest, so liquid fluorine and hydrogen are heavier fuels, that is, if liquid fluorine and liquid oxygen are used as fuel, the volume of the rocket can be reduced a lot, which is what we most hope for.</p>
<p>However, the difficult part is that fluorine is not easily extracted, which needs to be overcome. American scientists are currently working hard to study this issue.</p>
<h3>Climbing Perch and Archerfish</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>These two strange fish – climbing perch and archerfish – are produced in India.</p>
<p>The climbing perch has a pair of hard fins on its chest. By moving these fins in an alternating motion, it can climb up trees step by step in a stable posture. This fish can not only climb back and forth on tree trunks hanging over the water, but also rely on that pair of transformed fins to wade across areas far from the water surface.</p>
<p>The archerfish is about the same size as the climbing perch and is a freshwater fish. It has a force that allows it to contract and expand its mouth and throat. It usually swims along the shore with its mouth full of water. When it sees a fly basking in the sun on the branches and leaves, it immediately exposes its mouth to the surface of the water and, with its mouth swollen, shoots the water upwards.</p>
<p>Its mouth is like a water gun, and it shoots the water straight out when people are unprepared. Its sniping skills are so high that unless it doesn't see you, no one can escape if it does see you.</p>
<p>The archerfish has a flat body, like a small plate, and a triangular head. It has sharp eyesight and a powerful sniping force, and can sometimes shoot down spiders that are stretched on cobwebs several feet above the water.</p>

<h3>Morning Glory</h3>
<p>— Jialing</p>
<p>The morning glory is not a famous flower, and it has no alluring fragrance, so it has never been valued by people. However, if you observe it carefully, it is not difficult to find its beauty - the neat trumpet-shaped corolla, the ever-leftward winding vines, and the extremely clever posture. Shao Yong, a poet of the Song Dynasty, loved the morning glory very much, "The host凝伫looks, always ignoring court duties". He would get up early in the autumn morning to admire the morning glories with dewdrops in the clear air.</p>
<p>Eliminate Wind Toxins and Promote Urination</p>
<p>The morning glory is commonly called the trumpet flower, but in fact, the万萝 and purple jasmine also have trumpet flowers. Why is it called morning glory? According to the 本草 (herbology book): "This medicine first appeared, and the farmers thanked the deities for leading the cattle, so it was named after it." The seeds of the morning glory have medicinal value, and in traditional Chinese medicine, they are used to dispel wind toxins and promote urination.</p>
<p>Autumn is a rare time for flowers to bloom, leisurely guiding the morning glory up the short wall.</p>
<p>A long and tough vine is the characteristic of the morning glory. You can use it to make many interesting things: sow the seeds in a long charcoal basket, and soon the entire basket will be covered with luxuriant growth, with beautiful flowers blooming from the messy basket, full of antique charm. If we plant a row of morning glories on the ground, and use a stick for each plant to climb, it will soon grow into a natural fresh flower curtain.</p>
<p>Why Always Rotate Leftward</p>
<p>The vine of the morning glory always rotates leftward (counterclockwise). We have no way to make it rotate rightward.</p>
<p>Its leftward rotation is of course because the growth on the side of the vine that is closest to the supporting object is slower than the growth on the outside. Since there is a leftward-rotating morning glory, then a rightward-rotating one is also possible. Why can't we ever find a rightward-rotating one? Is it that leftward rotation is better than rightward rotation? Only the creator knows.</p>
<p>The morning glory is an annual plant. After the seeds have fallen, the stems and leaves gradually wither, and the vines on the fence gradually rot, becoming brittle and disappearing. Fortunately, the seeds have been left behind, and next year in the autumn wind and dawn mist, it can once again display its beautiful姿.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward to the Scientific World (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gangren</p>
<p>Perhaps small transmitters, transmitters, and receivers will be as lightweight and sophisticated as today's pens, allowing people to carry them around, saving a lot of gasoline, shoes, and postage, conveniently communicating with each other, and saving the most precious time.</p>
<p>In the realm of biological chemistry, industry will have greater achievements. Humans lacking protein will eat a kind of "steak" that is (discovered by Auhensen Busch). Is the nutritious food we feed livestock a product of wood waste? And will our descendants drink drinking water containing fluorine and obtain teeth that will never decay?</p>
<p>The greatest success, perhaps the most exciting work in science in the future, is to use the "photosynthetic effect" to absorb the energy sent by the sun to the earth to produce sugars, starches, proteins, and fats, and other essential human needs.</p>
<p>Perhaps those scientists who are working hard, such as Dr. Eugene Rabinowitch of the University of Illinois, will bring various new foods to mankind and create a brilliant new era for this world that is often short of supplies!</p>
<p>In short, mankind is gradually becoming the master of nature!</p>
<h3>The Most Profitable Investment: Scientific Research</h3>
<p>— Nifu</p>
<p>We can easily guess that the most profitable investment in an industrialized country like the United States must be in the development of industry; otherwise, because it is a so-called monetary empire, mining gold mines should be the most profitable. In fact, this is not the case. In the United States, the most profitable investment is actually in research on how to obtain more and better breeds of pigs, grains, or other agricultural products. According to Dr. W. V. Lambrt, Chairman of the Agricultural Research Committee of the US Department of Agriculture, the money the government spends on research to improve products and improve varieties in agricultural programs has now received a hundredfold return.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the scientific research expenses used for a few agricultural problems are only tens of millions of dollars, but the return obtained is nearly 25 billion US dollars. This does not include income from fields.</p>
<p>Here are some records declared by Mr. Lambert regarding agricultural research:</p>
<p>Hybrid Com - spent 10 million US dollars in research, and after a period of 30 years, now the annual income has increased by 75 million US dollars.</p>
<p>DDT - Only spent 50,000 US dollars in research. After cows are treated with DDT, they can avoid the sting of cow flies and obtain better products, so they can get 10 million US dollars of profit every year, and this number will even increase to 100 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Phenothiazine - This chemical medicine can eliminate parasites in livestock. The research cost is only 10,000 US dollars, but farmers can save on livestock feed and grow faster, and they can get back 10 million US dollars every year.</p>
<p>Other agricultural research "annual income" includes research on various grains and sugar harvests and preservation methods, which can therefore generate 100 million US dollars per year. Furthermore, due to gradual experience gained from improvements, the annual income can be increased by 500 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Dr. Lambert pointed out that agricultural science has made great contributions to human survival. It has found a way to produce Peniclilin in large quantities and is moving towards the future of how to provide nutrition to mankind.</p>
<p>At present, the international situation is becoming increasingly tense. The author believes that if American scientists can use the results of research on atomic energy to make atomic energy the source of all power in the world, then its benefits to the United States itself and the happiness of all mankind will be a thousand times greater than the contribution of agricultural science research. However, if we only devote ourselves to the manufacture of atomic bombs and toxic bacteria that reduce human warfare, then what is the use of producing large quantities of Penicillin and trying to supply human nutrition at the same time? The relationship between scientific research and human happiness and harm depends only on the difference in the thoughts of scientists. Scientists should know what to engage in!</p>
<p>Finally, the most profitable investment has been proven to be scientific research in the United States. Our Chinese entrepreneurs should know this for reference.</p>

<h3>New Student Deferment Measures: Reply from the Civil Affairs Office</h3>
<p>Re: Your Department's letter of September 12th, stating that university freshmen who have been admitted have obtained certificates for applying for deferment reasons, and various levels of personnel have made things difficult for them when they presented their certificates to the district Baojia offices for processing. Please order each district to comply and handle the matter in order to maintain their studies, etc.</p>
<p>Upon approval, it is found that university freshmen who have been admitted, such as those who have registered and are studying at school, may submit a certificate of study at the school and apply directly to this office for deferment. There is no need for the district Baojia to review and approve the application. The preceding paragraphs of the letter are hereby replied to, in the hope that you will investigate and act accordingly!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>To: Social Services Department of the Shenbao Newspaper Editorial Department</p>
<p>From: Civil Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government. September.</p>
<p>The more income, the heavier the tax</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I work in a certain wharf warehouse, and the treatment is harsh. Until last month, due to repeated negotiations, it was calculated according to the cost of living index, but when the salary was paid, 4.5% of the salary income tax was deducted, that is, 45,000 yuan was deducted for every million yuan. Now I have the following two points, and I hope you will answer them in detail, I look forward to it very much.</p>
<p>What is the government's stipulated salary income tax that should be levied?</p>
<p>Are the tax rates the same for high and low base salaries?</p>
<p>(My monthly salary is 60 yuan, calculated according to the workers' index)</p>
<p>Sincerely, Zhang Zizhong</p>
<p>[This answer] The salary income tax stipulated by the government is levied separately according to the amount of total income. According to the income tax rate of the second frequency A item of the income tax, the income between 800,000 yuan and 1.1 million yuan should be calculated at a tax rate of 10%. If 45,000 yuan is deducted for every million yuan, there is nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>The tax amount levied is calculated according to the total salary income, not according to the level of the base salary. The more income, the greater the tax burden.</p>
