<p>〔本報徐州廿九日電〕魯中各路國軍會師蔡陰後，國軍已可以絕對優勢地位控制沂蒙山區矣。蒙陰國軍廿九日繼續掃蕩四週地區之零星共軍，積極加强綏靖工作並撫輯洗亡，受共軍蹂躪壓迫達七年之蒙陰民衆，一日被國軍解放，重睹人日，男女老幼，莫不歡忭欲狂，故均自動協助國軍搶修公路，編組保甲，確立治安</p>

<h3>物價會今續商米糧問題　棉紗仍採取價辦法　京滬公用事業酌加補貼費</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕全國經濟委會物價委會廿九日下午三時召開第五次會議，强　主席，谷正綱，徐堪，兪鴻鈞，王雲五，吳國楨，張嘉激，沈怡等均出席，首由京市社會局長謝徵孚報吿京市公敎人員實物配售情形，並由糧次龐松舟，滬市長吳國楨報吿京滬兩地糧價及糧食供應情形，王雲五，張嘉激，曁中紡代表吳味經報吿滬市棉紗配售情形，旋討論米棉及公用事業之貼補諸案，經決議各案如次：（一）棉紗仍採限價辦法，每件決定以四百六十萬爲限價，政府收購時不計利，仍以四百六十萬爲準。（二）京滬公用事業仍按三四兩月份補貼辦法，酌加數額。（三）米糧問題討論未獲結果，其中關於學生公來問題，仍由市府曁學校當局商討妥善辦法，充分供給。</p>

<h3>遠東委會五五開會　討論賠百分率　美要求各國表明意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日電〕此間本日獲悉：遠東委員會將於五月五日舉行會議，企圖對日本賠償之百分率，獲致協議。據權威方面消息：美國於過去數週內，曾力謀使委員中十一國家代表，聲明其國家所希望之賠償百分率，並依個人意見，說明其他國家應得之百分率。美國由於麥帥之一再敦促，對賠償問題，作最後決定，刻已要求各國表明意見，俾打開目前僵局。外交觀察家，對未來會議之結果，並不十分樂觀，彼等私謂：對美國及中國等其他國家之賠償要求，仍毫不讓步，當不能獲致最後協議。外交人士謂：美國刻願准許每一國家保留其境內所有日人資產，唯是項資產必須自其最後要求中扣除之。如五月五日開始之會議，結果仍成僵局，則美國可向麥帥發出臨時指令，命其對要求賠償國家分配額外之初步賠償，一如最近命令麥帥分配百分之三十之現有資產，予中菲荷英四國。</p>

<h3>遠東委會我代表團顧問　楊雲竹今日赴美　昨與記者暢談對日各事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕遠東委員會我國代表團公使銜兼顧問楊雲竹氏，於二十六日抵滬後，突經主席電召返京，有所指示。楊氏業於前晚再度來滬，定今日搭戈登將軍號輪首途赴美。行前接見記者稱：此次赴美，爲期在一年左右，過日本時，當與我國駐日代表團方面會商，搜集必要資料，以備遠東委員會荆會時應用。我國處理日本問題時，重心在東京及華府，今後將致力於兩地間之密切聯繫。</p>
<p>日本賠償問題</p>
<p>關於日本賠償問題，楊氏認爲我國當前有兩項重要工作，一爲首批拆遷物資之運用，此批物資僅有四十八萬噸，但已需運費四千億國幣，另加數千萬美元以配購零件，得之不易，應思如何加以最大之利用。二爲對於日本總賠償問題之解決，應先作研究，定一詳盡之計劃。在三十四年倫　外長會議時，王外長即提出兩項原則：（一）我國應得最大之百分率，（二）我國應有優先受償權。當時英美熱烈贊成，法蘇亦無異言。故在總賠償計劃執行時，我國居於有利之地位。至於最近美方主張我國獲得臨時賠償之百分之四十五一節，楊氏謂官方尙未獲正式報吿，此事恐需馬歇爾國務卿回國後處理。在莫斯科開會之前，我方原希望美蘇妥協，使歐洲賠償問題得順利完成，作爲日本賠償方式之雲本，今則事與願違，以現狀卜之，日本賠償問題之全部解決，恐將需時兩年。</p>
<p>生產水準問題</p>
<p>生產論及決定日本之生產水準永準一節，楊氏指出問題生產水準有兩種：一爲「平時經濟水準」，亦即日本未來恢復之最高限度，此則盟國對日委員會已決定為採取一九三一年至一九三四年之平均數字。二爲「工業生產水準」，此則指實施賠償時保證維持之數字，亦即日本現存之最大生產能力，此則尙未決定，一切有商討之餘地</p>
<p>和約簽訂問題</p>
<p>至於對日和約之簽訂，麥帥總部已有人提出，我國現時應積極準備，爭取主動，並及早準備草約。和約何日能前，大部視歐洲局勢爲轉移，而訂立和約之程序，是否先解決解除武裝問題賠償問題後再訂，亦未作決定，凡此均爲今後遠東委員會討論主要課題。</p>

<h3>社論　世界和平的途徑</h3>
<p>——讀馬歇爾國務卿的演辭之後——</p>
<p>美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥自莫斯科返國後，卽於廿八日向全國人民發表廣播演說，報吿這次莫斯科外長會議的經過，使美國人民個個都能獲得一個正確的認識。美國政界及外交界人士，在莫斯科會議閉幕之後，咸以其所得的消息，均係通訊社及報紙所報導的新聞，故對於莫斯科外長會議的成敗，不願加以評論，而非俟至馬歇爾國務卿返國報告後，是不能作結論的。其實在我們也有同樣的成覺，現在聽了馬歇爾國務卿的長篇演說，更可以明瞭莫斯科會議失敗的癥結所在了。</p>
<p>我們綜合馬歇爾國務卿的演說，其要點有下列各項：（一）莫斯科外長會議的失收，由於蘇聯利用外長會議煽動人民的熱情與偏見，而不訴諸理智與諒解，有以致之。（二）所謂德國問題，分析言之，有下列五項問題：（一）德國中央政府的權限問題；（二）德國經濟制度之性質及其與歐洲各國之關係：（三）德國賠償問題之性質及其範圍；（四）德國之邊界問題；（五）起草對德和約之程序及其批准之方式。（三）美國對於關係重大之原則，所以不能妥協者，乃因不願「爲協定而成立協定」。（四）史丹林元帥於四月十五日曾向其表示，莫斯科會議所討論之主要問題，例如解除武裝，政治組織，賠償，曁經濟統一等問題，均可能成立妥協；但在此際，尙有忍耐之必要，務須避免悲觀。（五）馬帥竭誠希望史丹林所表示之見解爲正確，蘇聯代表出席下次國際會議卽能充分表現其合作精神。</p>
<p>由此可知，馬帥雖亦承認莫斯科外長會議的失敗，但在他的內心中仍熾燒着希望的火炬，一方面希望蘇聯在下次國際會議能充分表現其合作精神，使得各國意見不同的主要問題，均能獲得妥協；另一方面則又要求美國人民應採取團結一致的行動，以完成美國對於世界所負的任務。如果美蘇雙方均能如馬歇爾國務卿的理想，則不難撥開籠罩在兩國天際的疑雲慘霧而透露出和平民主的陽光來。所以馬帥的演說，不僅說明了當前世界的局勢，而且也指出了一條走向世界和平的途徑。我們不論從那一個角度去覜察世界的大勢，對於馬帥的賢明睿知的指示，終是非常重視，而應加以研究的。</p>
<p>在今日的世界上，可以說沒有一個人不企求和平！不渴望和平！只是對於締造世界和平所當採取的方法與途徑，各不相同而已。例如美蘇雙方，誰不要和平！但是兩國所走的途徑，不啻是背道而馳。蘇聯要求擴大其所謂「安全地區」，欲在其四週樹立「鐵幕」；另成一個世界；此在美國則要保持原子能的秘密及散遍世界各處的軍事基地，並欲以金元爲其外交的後盾，造成其防制全能主義擴張勢力的共同陣綫。因此雙方對於任何問題的意見，無往而不背道而馳。我們舍此不論，卽以美國本國而言，在美國國內不論何人，誰不渴望和平早日實現；但是對於如何贏得和平？意見也就不盡相同，在彼此之間，均有相當的距離。例如杜魯門總統於四月五日向民主黨大會發表演說稱：『美國對於締造世界和平責無旁貸；故對於各國人民之自由遭受危險者，均應負有援助之責，又爲負起此項責任起見，美國必須保有充分之軍事力量，使世界各國相信，美國決意依照其責任行事。』杜魯門總統的意見，當可目爲美國政策的基礎；最近美國在國際的一切活動，均以此爲準繩。其次是反對美國政策最爲激烈的華萊士，最近週遊歐洲各國，到處發表演說，雖然也說及美國人民渴望和平的迫切。但是他堅決反對杜魯門主義，竟稱杜魯門總統的援助希土計劃，足以招致世界的分裂，促成第三次大戰的爆發。他卞張與蘇聯諒解，要求政府貸款於蘇聯，協助其建設社會主義國家。此外，還有一位共和黨的總統候選人史泰森，週遊歐洲十六國後返國談稱：「美國若能保持强大並能採取有利於世界朴國之政策，則世界和平祗少可能維持三十年。」這是史泰森考察歐陸的結論，這三種意見，可以代表美國三方面的見解，但是美國締造世界和平，究底走那一條途徑呢？</p>
<p>我們在聽了馬歇爾國務卿的廣播演說之後，對於美國將來所採取的對歐政策，可以分析得出下面幾個新的動向。（一）美國將積極援助希土兩國：（二）充分利用魯爾區與西里西亞區之資源，藉以穩定歐洲經濟，使歐陸亦成爲一個經濟單位；（三）對於德國繼續加以管制，使其成爲一和平民主的國家；（四）統一德國西部，英美佔領區在經濟上合併之後，又復在政治上實行合併，並歡迎法國亦能參加；（五）爭取法國的支持，戴高樂派已在法國境內發起法國人民團結運動，顯係受美國此種政策的鼓勵。</p>
<p>美國採取這種政策，能否促進歐洲的和平？誰也不能予以肯定的答覆，就是美國總統杜魯門和國務卿馬歇爾，也不一定會有十二分的把握。不過我們相信，世界各國的人民這樣迫切渴望和平，全人類的願望終必能有實現的一天。馬帥要求美國人民了解其他各國的見解，俾使這些錯綜複雜的問題，均能獲得具體而確切的斛決；實在是美國走向世界和平的唯一的途徑。反之，我們對於蘇聯，沒有別的苛求，但願她也能像美國一樣，將一切國際問題，均訴諸良心與理智，使偏見與狂熱，無由產生，則任何困難的問題，也就不難迎刃面解了。</p>
<p>要之，我們這樣的期待若美蘇兩國，都能走向世界和平的途徑。漁管處長宣佈保送辦法</p>

<h3>馬歇爾發表廣播　闡明美所持立塲　外長會議失敗咎在蘇聯　名達林曾告馬卿謂妥協係屬可能</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕國務卿馬歇爾頃譴責蘇聯使莫斯科會議趨於失敗，但亦透露史達林認爲對各項重要對德問題有獲致妥協之可能。馬歇爾在其向全國之廣播演說報吿莫斯科會議之經過情形時稱：余於四月十五日赴克里姆林宮與史達林進行會談，當時史達林曾率直以爲此次會議不能獲得「重要成就」。蘇聯代表團不但使此次會議不能商獲成議，且利用之爲宣傳　見與感情用事之塲所，而不覓取理智與諒解。盟國間之鴻溝，今已明白呈在眼前。美國乃爲「協議而協議」，故對各項重大原則，不予妥協。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日向全國廣播，報告革期科會議經過，歷半小時，據謂，四外長會議對於重大問題，雖未能成立協議，但對於促成將來最後解決之成就，可能較實感者爲大。各項重大齟齬首次全盤托出，此際已切實明瞭，故將來重開談判時，對於解決之道，可有正確之認識。莫斯科會議未能成立協議，自吾人觀之，實由於蘇聯堅持其各項提案之故。依照此種提案，德國應設立中央集權政府，對整個國家取得絕對統治權，惟因地少人衆並須以其生產之一大部份，賠償蘇聯，此在經濟上必無以自存。蘇聯代表團並以另一方式，對奧地利作同樣要求。自美國代表團觀之，此種企圖不僅使美國陪累無窮，且可促成德國與歐洲生活之惡化，而使獨裁與鬥爭乘時而起。莫斯科方面宣傳感情用事，抹煞理智與諒解。蘇聯代表幽對於波茨坦及其他協定之指責與解釋，與衆所週知之事實或美國代表團實際所知者，大相逕庭。吾人對於大原則，不能委曲求全，務須以誠意了解彼此不能同意之處。馬氏報吿渠與史達林會談內容稱：史帥嘗謂，莫斯科會議僅爲解決歐洲和約之「斥堠部隊前哨接觸」。馬氏並稱，以往對其他問題發生之種種爭執，照例大家精疲力竭之後，即認識妥協之必要。此次會議殆無重大成就之可能，史氏以爲各項重大問題，如解除德國武裝，德國政治機構，賠償與經濟統一之類，均有妥協之可能，故有忍耐之必要，不可遽爾悲觀。余誠心希望史氏見解之正確，其中暗示蘇聯代表團在將來會議中將出以更大之合作精神。但吾人不能漠視時間的因素。歐洲之復興，已遠較預料者爲遲緩。分裂之力量益形顯明。羣醫在臨床診斷之時，病人情勢已日益沉重。故余以爲某種行動不能等待筋疲力盡後而始妥協。新的問題正在產生，任何足以應付此種迫切問題之行動，必須立即採取。馬氏結論稱：「今日世界大局與美國所處地位，使美國人民有一致行動之責任。」馬氏對於共和黨參議院外交委員會主席范登堡與民主黨前參院外交委負會王席康奈萊一致領導促成援助然土法案通過，加以讚揚，認為華盛頓之目標一致，渠在莫斯科折衝獲益無窮。</p>
<h3>莫斯科外長會議結束後　美國政策愈堅定　當能獲得歐洲非共產國家擁護</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿八日電〕美國自莫斯科外長會議後，其歐洲政策已淸晰規定，得未曾有。美國代表團希望此一政策能獲全歐洲非共產主義各民族之擁護。要點如下：（一）杜魯門總統宣布援助希臘與土耳其。蘇聯方面斥之爲美國帝國主義。美英法及若干小國在莫斯科之外交家均謂此舉足徵美國對於共產主義意向之鄭重，及美方願意旣言且行。（二）國際利用魯爾與西里西亞等地資源之權利，美國認係歐洲經濟之基本需要。國務卿爲歇爾曾數度主張由一歐洲經濟委員會擔托設法統一歐洲經濟工作。（三）馬歇爾對四國條約之聲明。其原擬草約語調雖求綏和，以免開罪蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，但馬氏無異謂不問有無四國條約，美國擬管制德國多年。（四）民主定義。在討論德國政治問題時，馬氏曾聲明美國贊成民主與個人自由。其手下多數顧問認爲此係美蘇衝突中心問題之一。（五）美國屢次企圖博取法國之擁護，頗著成效。美國欲使法國在對蘇衝突時明白加入西方國家集團，此種願望可於美方對於薩爾，德國煤斤等問題之態度中見之。（六）整個對德國政策自解除軍備演變爲着重再建和平德國，而不苛球賠償。美國堅持德國須能自給，並製造貨物以供全歐洲之需。以上所述乃新近發展之美國政策要點，是否能受德國各小鄰邦歡迎，尙待分曉。美國政策之發展頗涉困難與糾紛，在美國代表團內部亦多激烈論辯。其最者名者即杜爾斯及其「泛歐洲」路綫與克萊及其「德國爲主」路綫間之衝突。由於英法二國柔弱，不能保持其歐洲領袖地位，歐陸權力政治已縮小爲美蘇關係問題。美國關係由「善鄰」變成「強鄰」。美國態度到達如是程度，即美國人民莫不需要友誼合作但感覺非藉武力對付武力無法獲得。故如奧地利和約條款之類逐字均生爭執，蓋因各方互不信任對方具有誠意履行義務也。</p>
<h3>史泰遜談話　謂美應保持強大</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿八日電〕美國共和黨總統候選人史泰遜在歐洲十六國考察之後，頃返抵此間，向報界發表談話稱：美國若能保持强大，且能採取有利于各國之人道政策，則和平至少能維持三十年。惟美國必須避免一切政府剝削重要工業之政策。生產若能增加，生活水準自可抬高，此事唯有私人企業所能造成，而非政府所能促成者也。至於渠與史達林元帥會晤情形，史泰遜拒不發表任何意見。僅謂在談話時曾將談話紀錄在案，擬將用英俄兩文，同時發表。</p>
<h3>眞理報評論</h3>
<p>謂外長會議頗有成就</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：蘇聯「眞理報」撰論，指稱莫斯科外長會議獲有成就，並對外國報紙宣吿會議失敗之論調，嚴調駁斥。該社論謂此次會議獲致多種重要之協議，且闡明各國對德國問題之眞正立塲，實爲一種成功。莫斯科會議可謂已奠定德國問題解決之基礎云。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾廣播演說　多數議員均予攢揚</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕民主黨領袖巴克萊對馬歇爾今日之報吿，譽之爲「渠所發現有關莫斯科會議情形之最坦白與最有意義之節要」。此可視爲國會方面對其報吿最初反響之基調。巴克萊又稱：「就予之意見觀之，馬歇爾以罕有之能力與鎭定，擁護美國之立塲。」其他民主共和兩黨之參衆議員，亦一致響應巴克萊之聲明，一致同意認爲馬歇爾對莫斯科四强會議，作一次有意義詳盡之報吿。惟頃曾批評美行政常局援助希土計劃之參議員裴柏稱；「馬歇爾之報吿，已問明如吾人欲使現存在於美蘇之間之歧見解決有所進展，則吾人雙方應以一種妥協精神，從事解決此一問題。吾人不能片斷地加以解決」云。</p>
<h3>清算租借債務　美蘇明日談判</h3>

<h3>美衆院外委會主席伊頓　直率指責蘇政略　朝鮮局勢與希土兩國完全相同</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕衆院外交委員會主席伊頓本日談稱：希臘與土耳其如遭傾覆，則伊朗與其他阿拉伯國家亦不能避免同樣情形，繼之者尙有阿富汗·印度·及中國。果爾，則一億四千萬之美國人民將對抗廿萬萬受「消滅吾人爲目的之思想」所煽動之人民。伊頓坦白說明援助希土二國之計劃乃用以阻止共產主義，自其根源—蘇聯—向各處傳播。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕衆院外交委員會主席伊頓今日在衆院法制委員會中稱，吾人在朝鮮所面臨之局勢，與在希臘及土耳其完全相同。該國不但分成美蘇兩部，且有共產哲學滲入美國區，余誠不知如何可避免與蘇聯之嚴重衝突云。</p>
<h3>華萊士招待記者</h3>
<p>說明對內外政策意見</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕華萊士預爲組織一「和平的黨」留一洞開之門戶，以便推選其爲一九四八年總統競選之候選人。在其自歐返國後之第一次正式新聞招待會中，華氏辯護其在美國未對外作戰時，有權發表言論，反對杜魯門之外交政策。渠稱，維持世界和平之方法，乃貸與外國犂鋤與曳引車而非軍火。在長歷一小時之新聞招待會中，華萊士涉及範圍廣汎之國內外問題其意見約如有下述：（一）美國在一九四八年將有一次商業蕭條，「但並非一嚴重者」。美國非至其資金眞正開始堆積如山，而外國耗盡其美元時，不致遭遇嚴重經濟蕭條。（二）蘇聯恐懼美國眞有一重大之經濟挫折，此或爲蘇聯拒絕參加世界銀行及其他國際經濟活動之原因。（三）美國指定大量款項，購買軍火輸出國外，實較在國內開墾農地及其他計劃爲易。華萊士稱，渠不擬再作國外之遊，但渠曾被邀請赴荷比希捷智利及阿根廷等國。渠又稱，並未有人邀請渠往訪蘇聯云。</p>

<h3>報告莫斯科會議經過　馬歇爾演辭全文</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今晚向全國發表廣播演講，概述最近結束之莫斯科外長會議所面臨之各項問題與結果。演辭全文如下：</p>
<p>今晚我希望能把莫斯科外長會議所討論的各種問題的基本性質，使人完全明瞭。</p>
<p>這一次會議是討論我們所在爭取的和平的心臟。這次會議是討論歐洲的重要中心—德國和奧國，這裘是一個有很多受過技術訓練的人口的區域，有很大的資源和工廠，這裏近來前後曾有二次幾乎使世界瀕於浩刦。在莫斯科談判中，所有會議中關於義大利和巴爾幹條約的一切很顯明的異議，都被提出來，而實際上仍未獲得解決</p>
<p>概括的談論和模稜兩可的方案並不能處理那些和我們未來文明有直接關係的難題。爲了處理這種難題，我們必須具體解決各種極端複雜的問題，諸如有關疆界，生產並管制萬千人民生活必需品等的問題。報紙和無錢電的報導已使諸位熟悉外長會的日常活動，我毋庸多說，以免重複。然而由於我們所考慮的三大問題的性質至爲錯綜複雜，我遂有詳儘報吿的必要，以抒述我在議席上對於各項問題之所見。　我們在莫斯科城應對奧和約和防德協定的希望誠有實現的可能。至於對德和約及其有關問題（多爲現行之德國問題）我們曾希望獲致原則上之協議，俾使我們的代表在他們於下次會議舉行前所進行的工作中有所遵循。　在這種廣播中，實際討論外長會懸而未決的種種問題，誠是不可能的。我願喚使人們矚目於若干基本問題，這種問題一旦解決，其他異見亦可望隨之消弭。</p>
<p>歐洲煤斤供應影響至為深遠</p>
<p>煤斤問題—會議上不但要顧到某些問題在幾個月內對歐洲人民立即產生的影響，而且要顧到問題的複雜性。舉一個例來說，全歡洲更切需要更多的煤斤，以供應工廠，公用事業，鐵路，家庭的需要。但是盟國許多的煤礦無法開採，除非那些損壞的煤礦，採煤機械，鐵路交通以及其他設備工具都完全復員。這些復員工作需要更多的鋼鐵，而更多的鋼鐵又反過來需要更多的煤斤來製造它。因此，我們必須記住一點：當必要的復員工作正在進行的時候，盟國鄰邦在最近的將來所可能獲得的煤斤量必然减少。</p>
<p>煤斤量的减少，其結果就使勞工方面，失業人數逐漸增加，物資方面，生產的振興曠日持久。這些物資原可以輸出贏利，用以購買糧食和生活必需品的，因此，生產的不振成爲煤礦復員工作必有的後果。這種現象，使法國深受影響。於是煤斤問題的解決便成誠法國一項嚴重的難題。但在德國方面，除了美國的貸款以外，她必須利用煤斤從事生產然後將產品輸出，換取必要糧食的進口。因此，其他各國，如英，蘇等也都受到直接影響，只是程度上不同而已。</p>
<p>德國問題談判牽涉世界和平</p>
<p>而且，和鋼鐵生產有着直接關係的煤斤問題，背後是德國重工業基礎的重要問題，這個問題，以後可能再度成爲對世界和平的一種威脅。我引述這一個例子，來說明這些談判中所牽涉的種種複雜情形。</p>
<p>德國—柏林的盟國管制會提出在目前德國軍政府之下有關政治·軍事·經濟和財政情形的許多問題的詳細報吿。關於這些問題，各外長曾考慮到德國臨時政治機構的形式和範圍，以及籌備對德和約應循的程序。</p>
<p>德國問題的談判不但牽涉歐洲和世界的安全，而且涉及整個歐洲的繁榮。我們的使命原爲討論一種長期條約的條件，但同時我們面臨着各種對歐洲貧苦人民具有重要關係的直接問題，他們正在呼求援助，呼求煤斤，糧食和大多數生活必需品，他們多半痛恨造成這種災難情形的德國。這些問題對於英美人民，也有重要的關係，他們（英美人民）不能繼續爲德國解囊，拿出數萬萬元來，因爲目前沒有採取措施，迅速終止這種撥款。</p>
<p>我所關注的嚴重而且基本的德國問題不外乎：（一）德國中央政府的權限；（二）德國的經濟性質及其與歐陸各國的關係；（三）賠償的範圍及性質；（四）德國的疆界；（五）所有對德作戰國家參與擬定並簽訂對德和約之方式問題，　（待續）</p>

<p>昨日伏渡艦死難官兵家屬四十五人，清晨即齊集地院等候開庭。刑二庭鐘推事升座後，官兵家屬即列隊入庭據旁聽席前排靜坐。另有本市法學院生數十人亦來聽審，一時法庭極形擁擠。</p>
<p>戴儒林供·肇事經過</p>
<p>庭上首提被吿戴儒林，據供：四十二歲，福建籍，係海閩輪船長，任職僅三月，以前曾任其他海輪船長。海閩輪最高航行速率爲每小時十三浬，三月十九日午夜零時發生互撞時之速率爲九浬半。零時零分海面一片漆黑，風浪甚大，在輪左發現一白燈。零時七分又見一綠燈，知有船駛近。海閩輸即拉汽笛一聲，並立即開倒車。但已不及避讓，發生互撞，但未有鉅大震盪，當時亦未知有船艦沉失。至此庭上轉詢證人海閩輪二副吳侃，據稱：該日輪値夜班，零時發現前面白燈後，船長即上甲板探視。互撞時約略見伏波艦向右角駛去。撞後戴船長即命停船，令我打燈號，並用無綫電與伏波艦呼應詢問，但無回音。停船約十餘分鐘後仍一無動靜，乃緩緩行駛搜尋，約一小時後始聞呼救聲，用探海燈探照，發現焦德孝後，即將船駛近。因一時風浪兇猛，施救近二小時，始將焦救起。繼訊海閩輪大副吳念祖，據稱：互撞時已入睡，驚醒後上甲板觀着，遇船長，命檢查本輪受創情形，餘無所見。餘如海閩輪舵工等人所供證詞，大致與前二人無甚差異</p>
<p>焦德孝稱·艦沉甚速</p>
<p>惟據伏波艦上唯一得救之焦德孝陳述：任艦上輪機長，現年三十一歲，互撞發生時已入睡，被巨聲驚醒，艦身震盪極大，知己出事，即披衣上甲板，見有七十餘人齊集甲板上，艦長正指揮拍發緊急呼救電，及用燈光打信號給海閩輪。一面凖備救生艇，救生帶，浮筒等逃生　具。不料艦沉甚速，約二三分鐘即已沉沒，本人亦隨艦下水，因有救生帶，復浮至海面，拉着一浮筒。其時浮於海面官兵爲數極衆，但聞一片凄　呼救聲，但眼見海閩輪仍繼續前駛，與風浪掙扎約近一小時，始見有船駛近，乃設法接近，至被救上船時，已昏迷不知人事矣。</p>
<p>旁聽席上·一片泣聲</p>
<p>焦德教供述時，勞聽席上死難官兵家屬中傳出一片抽咽聲，法警即上前勸止，鍾推事又訊海閩輪，乘客鄭國榮，據稱：出事時已睡覺，但覺船身仍在行走，惟方面不辨，隔十分鐘仍不見任何動靜，當時乘客皆議論紛紛，因在下艙未見戴儒林行動如何。至午夜二時許發現焦德孝在海中，遂由船上水手施救，將其拖起。再訊戴儒林據稱：互撞後照航海規則應先檢查本輪有無沉沒危險，故停駛約十分鐘，同時令二副用燈光及無綫電擬與伏波通訊，但並無回音，因衝撞前，本輪係開倒車，而伏波艦仍未停駛，故本輪停駛後與伏波艦距離實已甚遠。本輪於檢查畢後，即徇伏波艦航路緩緩行駛尋覓，因此得以發現焦德孝。</p>
<p>夜黑長高·施救困難</p>
<p>庭上追詢何以救焦德孝如此費時，是否存心不良，企岡滅口。戴答稱：於昏黑之大海中救人，不比陸上，且輪船行駛時，風浪更大，雖不溺斃，亦有被浪濤擊斃可能，故必須特別小心，此事航海專家可以解釋。又訊救焦德孝上船之海閩輪水手馬富根稱：因見海中僅焦一人，故未放救生艇，曾拋救生圈五次。其時風浪險惡，施救困難，第五次拋圈始吿成功。其餘證人供詞亦無何新發現。退庭後戴還押途上，死難官兵家屬老幼婦孺全體上前將戴包圍，號美呌駡，一片雜亂，要求償命，經法警努力騙散，戴始脫圍入獄。</p>

<h3>工資物價脫節過遠　勞工問題專家主張　指數應予恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於生活指數解凍問題，社會局即將於日內召開會議加以研究。惟解凍指數因有碍政府法令，該會或將就其他途徑另覓妥善辦法，改善受物價高壓下之工人生活，建議中央採納。記者昨日曾往訪某勞工問題專家，探詢對此問題之意見。渠表示絕對主張解凍。蓋當初政府下令凍結時，聲明將一面盡力抑平物價，惟證之數月來事實，當今物價與一月份之指數脫節過遠，如此而再欲長此凍結，置職工生活於不顧，實太不公平。如言爲欲維特政府威信，則至少亦應以其他方法從速補救。工人至今所以引起反感者，乃因物價之驟然狂跳，心理上不平所致。假如物價係逐步上漲，工人恐不致有多大不滿。以往各方曾研討究係物價刺激工資，抑係工資刺激物價。證之工人生活指數凍結後物價仍瘋狂上漲，當可判明工資並未刺激物價。惟現今假如工人之生活指數一旦解凍，自一月份七千九百餘倍驟然恢復至目前四月份之適當倍數，是否將刺激物價之上漲，事前亦須加以愼重考慮。總之目前無諭解凍指數抑或不解凍而另想辦法，對職工之生活問題應從速加以注意。否則工人生活不能維持，糾紛必將層出不窮。</p>
<p>評斷會研究補救辦法　擬增日用品計算種數</p>
<p>〔又訊〕〕社會局長吳開先上次晋京，對指數解凍問題，曾向行政院張院長及社會部谷部長有所請示，頃已手諭上海市勞資評斷委員會各專門委員，組小組會研究之。該小組會定五月三日會議，決將研究所得，擬具辦法，呈請最高當局採納施行，在不違背政府經濟方案原則下，覓取物價飛漲時之補救辦法。聞專門委員方面主張差額金除原有之米·煤·油·糖·鹽·布六種外，將生活指數中之其餘各種之日常必需品，予以增加，俾職業工人與產業工人得以維持目前之最低生活云。</p>
<h3>破獲竊車黨　為一韓人主持數月犯案十次　探員喬裝購車客　南陽橋畔獲人贓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警備部第四稽查大隊，近接獲密報，謂本中現有一國際性之刦車黨組織，負責人爲一韓國靑年名李一平，手下擁有竊掖高明之黨羽十餘名，十時西裝革履，出入交際塲所，乘人不備，專事竊盜吉普車及各種車輛爲業。經多方偵查，始於本月廿五日獲得綫索，惟該組織相當嚴密，殊難着手，經商討結果，先行籌款七百萬元，並海幹員化裝前往該團對外接洽大三元茶室，以代客購買吉普車爲由，與對方名金允澤者一再談判，最後以三千萬元一輛談妥，並爲表示信用起見，先付七百萬元定銀，約於廿七日晚比時在南陽橋西藏南路口貨款兩交。屆期由稽查大隊預派大批人員在南陽橋一帶預伏。守候至十時許，果有一俄人駕駛之國滬第一八五二三號夫軍用吉普車到來，車上除俄人外，尙有接洽人韓人金允澤，崔鐘泰及另一俄人，遂一併逮捕。經帶隊偵訊，該二俄人供稱，一名古列立梯（住公平路二二二弄五十八號），一名納利斯，所駕車輛方由蒲石路十川層樓美軍停車塲竊來，惟彼等堅不吐露負責人及同黨地點，僅謂彼等業此已有數月，所竊車輛約計十部，均係隨盜盜賣，其中一輛於二月前售於平凉路三星車行，得款亦早已分化殆盡云云。該隊據供後，當即馳往三星車行，將該行經理錢榮生拘捕。經偵訊後，已供認收贓不諱。現該隊除將上項人犯先予移送警備部稽查處核辦外，一面仍派員繼續偵查，務使所有同黨一網打盡。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華僑鉅子胡文虎之子胡好，現爲星島球隊之主持人，當星島隊征滬消息在報上刋出後，有一商人名閔振漢，即具狀地院控吿胡好。據稱：民國卅四年九月，胡好由港至渝時，向其購買薄荷腦五箱，給付上海商業儲蓄銀行重慶支行支票三張，振業銀行支票二張，合計票款九百八十七萬元，成交後第二日胡即趁飛機出國。隔三日後至銀行領款，不料均遭退票，乃急至一心花園飯店找尋，知已出國，經電胡文虎交涉，亦未得結果，不得已具狀重慶地院控吿，經缺席審理，判胡好罰金九萬元，並淸償票款及利息，然胡好一去不歸，且行蹤不明，無從執行。現因知星島足球隊來滬，胡好料必隨隊來此，故請求地院迅即拘押，命償還前款。地院受狀後，向星島隊票傳胡好，但此次胡本人並未隨隊來滬，地院對此案亦仍無法執行。</p>
<h3>社會服務　申報館與救濟醫院　合辦防治沙眼概況</h3>
<p>歷時八月施診六千次治愈四百餘人</p>
<p>沙眼一疾，在我國傳怖甚廣，想者佔全人口百分之七十以上，其中尤以靑年男女爲最多。查沙限之初期患者，往往不易覺察，故時被忽視，及至病根已深，療治每難致效，如是輾轉傳染，遂成星火燎原之勢。小則妨害個人之健康與事業，大則國家民族亦蒙其害矣。本館有鑒於斯，爰於去年八月一日起與本市西藏南路救濟醫院聯合舉辦「沙眼防治運動」，迄今歷九閱月，雖不敢妄想從此根絕斯疾，亦所以喚起國人之注意，願一般靑年對此有所警惕耳！　此項防治運動自去年八月一日開始以來，已歷五屆，申請檢治人數迄三月三十一日爲止，共計五九四人，其中以中學生爲最多，大學小學生次之，敎職員又次這，平均每人療治十次，前後已達六千次以上。根據該院綜合統計，申請檢治者以患第二期沙眼爲最多，共得二百四十一人，第一期患者次之，得一百四十二人，其他三四期不過十數人而已。</p>
<p>至於醫療工作，皆由該院諸醫師議務任，藥品如硝酸銀·硫酸銀·黃汞軟膏等，皆由該院免費供給，其中九人且經手術割治，均由該院眼科孫元明醫師義務施行，不取分文。根據該院統計，經治療痊愈者約占百分之七十左右，距離預定計劃猶相去遠甚，今後當益加惕勵，以期獲致更大之效果，對各界熱心人士之贊助，表示無限之謝忱。</p>

<h3>羅斯福盃賽　中美兩隊今夜再戰</h3>
<p>羅斯福盃中美籃球賽日前在市體育館展幕，結果中華下馬施威，奪得勝利，今日午後七時半，仍在原處作第二次比賽，裁判鄭志芳，金作陶，如中華再捷，即獲得該杯，否則將於後白三度決戰，以定王座誰屬，門票售樓上五千及樓下八千，收入撥充慈善經費，軍警亦須購票入場，長期劵停用。五時起開始售票，六時開放大門，由格致童軍及軍憲維持秩序，賽前請吳市長到塲頒發市長杯甲組大銀杯，蓋甲組錦標隊美海軍哥倫市短期內即將離滬，特予提前給獎也。</p>
<p>中華健兒於第一仗中，充分發揮優越之技術以及合作之功夫，賴同心協力，卒能擊破美軍之防禦而奏凱歌，陣容支配，相當得體，以華聯爲王，輔以劉福善及馬燦希，牡丹綠葉，相得益彰，今日如蔡演雄足傷痊愈，不妨出爲一試，中華旣勝首仗，今晚得失，更覺重要，望諸將再接再厲戮力以赴，連二取美軍，奪獲該杯　美軍以哥倫布爲代表，故不但戰力可畏，合作亦天衣無縫，愛許具熟練之賽藝，投籃百發百中，球迷一致譽爲最危險人物。而勃洛瑞，約翰遜等，亦智勇兼備，上駟之材，揭幕戰美軍旣飲恨敗挫，今日再度相逢，必謀報復，預卜屆時與我中華隊定有更緊張劇烈之競爭，一塲血戰勢所難免，兩隊陣容如下：</p>

<h3>島上球事闌珊　南華士氣不振</h3>
<p>足球聯賽，已到季末，各塲戰事大都無關重要。廿六日（週六）甲組三塲舉行，三華隊出師只有中華勝仗，南華，東方喪師。</p>
<p>南華塲上，東方先以二比零敗於爹云隊，南華上陣，又以三比二給空軍打走，南華陣容雖不完整，但空軍亦非勁旅，所敗者，士氣不振，無話可說！　只有中華在香港會塲戰勝頑旅金兵四二營，精神可嘉，比數是三對零。</p>
<p>此次星島征滬，該隊主將「神腿」馮景祥，因起部積血未淸，爲準備領軍遠遊英國，愼重調養，故未有付滬隨師督戰。現星鳥已榮膺本年度雙料冠軍，刻定五月四日舉行頒獎戰由甩島對聯隊。</p>
<h3>香港人看越南隊　認為作風太野蠻</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕越南足球隊，在港最後一戰，廿四日對華聯，因爲華隊的主力星島有上海之行，未能派員效力，排陣未符理想。</p>
<p>開賽的時候，華聯乘順風之利，劉榮光趁　軍中踢入一隻，石金罰十二碼中的，以二比零佔先前半時。</p>
<p>易地再戰，越方轉得風勢，配合他們的速度，竟於五分鐘內扳回三球，反敗爲勝，往後越方再攻進兩球，華聯亦得一隻，成五比三，越方得最後勝利。</p>
<p>總觀越南四戰，勝敗各半，成績不弱。香港人一般觀感，認爲全隊野蠻作風太濃，最後一戰中，黎文牙竟動手毆打謝錦河，體育精神絕對不佳，身爲客隊，不應作如是演出。</p>
<p>日來細雨飄飄，影響球事進行，越南籃球隊到港後，自勝大中華一仗，即賽期屢誤，廿五日始能在加山繼續舉行第二幕，對手是中靑隊，觀衆寥寥，門票僅售出十一張。</p>
<p>是戰中靑只得五將臨塲，鍾志强，辛仲堅又短於氣，越隊本應奪得勝利，但却以卅九比卅八敗北，便人失望。</p>
<h3>全市運動會　五月十五日報名截止　男女五千人　參加健身操</h3>

<h3>社會局昨雖提高拋價　白粳限價並未變更</h3>
<p>食油麵粉雜糧等一致騰漲</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市情形，仍未見好轉，一般米號雖仍照常開門，但大多無米供應。有者亦爲紅秈及碎米，白粳大多只能從黑市中求之。當局對每日拋米九千包，而市上米店無貨供應現象，深爲注意。深恐有不法米商從中玩弄花樣，現正派員密查中。關於今後整個米市供銷及產區價格等問題，待吳市長出席全國物價會議，於今晨返滬後，當可有統盤決定。　昨南北兩市塲共到貨二一四〇石。白粳交易未有做開。社曾局昨拋出白米及暹邏米共九千包，價十四萬七千元，較以前之十三萬五千五百元，亦提高一萬一千五百元。其原因據糧食科長吉明齋稱：係因市府令米商將門售限價十六萬八千元再予降低未果，乃將拋價提高，而門售限價則仍爲十六萬八千元。</p>
<p>昨日麵粉油雜糧等一致上漲。本廠豆油五十五萬元，漲起一萬五千元。靑島吉桶生油五十八萬元，較昨漲三萬元。凈生油五十三萬元，漲三萬元。洋粉十一萬七千元，漲一萬元。本粉八萬一千五百元，漲二千五百元。麩皮六萬三千元，漲起三千五百元。靑島生仁三十萬元，漲一萬元，大連靑豆十六萬元，漲四千元。大連元豆十六萬三千元至十七萬元，漲五千元左右。寗波揀白蠶豆十九萬五千元，漲五千元。</p>
<p>又訊：油市到不敵銷，異常倘俐，登峯造極，漲勢甚銳，猛漲二三萬元。午時油高業公會由經濟監察組組長王仲靑，面囑理事長張超，設法平定油價。</p>
<p>又訊：市府專門委員黃家駒，昨會同社會局視察武逸民，於虹口一帶調查各米號銷售情形，一般均極良好。使有少數米號均未立帳册，至無從稽核，聞將呈報核辦云。</p>
<h3>掉期近銀根緊　華股多頭出籠</h3>
<p>華股昨掉期迫近，銀根見緊，業中多頭不願再負擔貼價損失，頗有出籠，但業外游資仍有滲入，雜股尙堅，過程穩健。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>時人心尙穩，勤興漲停，二二四號二二三號九七號一八三號逢高有售，遞永紗開後自五一三〇元降爲四九四〇元。一九〇號一〇二號一四號一四一號七八號二二號均進，中絲由一三三號，九福由八五號，景綸由六一號等掛高至漲停，新亞由八四號三二號紛紛掛紅，永紗乃升至五〇五〇元，略起掙扎，八五號一四二號六一號八五號九四號七六號來進，遞美亞亦迫停板，九九號一六〇號一二號九四號一二九號一四號再進，美亞現貨又停，永紗遂漲到五一六〇元。八號一六〇號七八號一一七號一五二號九四號一四五號紛售，四五號等則售現永紗，近午浮多潰散，遞永紗迫低至四九〇〇元內低價結束。統益跌至限度。結果較前收計勤興漲停，信和微挫，永紗華豐永公新光跌半成，景福新華跌一成，中法微升，美亞漲停後有回，軋升一成不到。遞交計永紗信和新光微降，永公華豐跌半成，景福跌半成强，美亞漲停後有回，漲半成强。冷股榮豐火柴漲停後有回，計前者升半成弱，後者漲一成不到，統益跌停，景綸中絲九福新亞均吿漲停，大跌一成，內衣國貨各降半成，五和微升，餘均微降。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>因夜報載有證交否認取銷遞交，及申電回縮之說，人心見好。遞永紗開高至五〇〇〇元，一二六號二三一號買進，勤興九福景綸新亞中絲均告漲停，自五〇三〇元有二〇五號一八五號二二三號八號一四四號九四號一六〇號等賣出，步降至四八七〇元。一五三號二三二號九四號二三一號一三號一八六號乘低有納，升爲五〇〇〇元。三六號一一七號七六號一三一號乘高再賣，美亞火柴亦吿漲停，無甚影響，永紗有套賣供售，而復迫低至四八七〇元左右。此後形成盤局，九七號有進，一八〇號一九〇號則出，無甚特變。新光由二〇四號獨力購買，形勢轉堅。結果較前收計勤興漲停，永紗景福新華各跌半成，信和新光華豐微降，永公平，美亞漲停後有回，軋升半成强，中法小升。遞交計永紗華豐信和永公微降，美亞漲停，新光平，景福跌半成，冷股計九福中絲景綸五和新亞漲停，榮豐漲停後有回，統益跌停後微回，中紡平，餘微挫及跌半成左右，塲外各股均吿再漲</p>
<h3>新買活動　統債驟漲</h3>
<p>公債昨有新買參加，成交驟增加至一千萬左右。五〇三室及潤德有納，散多稍加了結。統丙晨開一四三〇〇元，自一四一〇〇元起盤升至一六六〇〇元而後稍定。結果較前收計甲乙祗升五百元，丙漲二千元，丁升一千三，戊漲二千元。</p>
<h3>外股盤旋</h3>
<p>外股昨盤旋而已，各方出入不一，廣幫中人先出後進，銀行幫及北幫有進，證劵幫有出，怡紗晨開六〇五〇〇元，自六一〇〇〇元起盤低至五九〇〇〇元關口結果。結果較前收計怡啤電話開平各跌半成，會德豐微升，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>證交否認　停做遞交</h3>
<p>證券交易所發言人昨日語記者，外傳該所將停止遞交之說，完全不確，據稱遞交係事前呈請核准，截止目前，並未接得有關停止遞交之任何命令，關於開拍美金債劵一事，交所當局表示極爲歡迎，早經在二樓闢有交易塲所，並已有四十餘家經紀人，將來正式開拍，經紀人必可增加，總之開拍美金債劵，一切凖備均已就緒，一旦當局有命，隨時即可實行云。</p>
<h3>棉紗運港</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今午太古公司盛京輪，自滬駛港，除裝雜貨一千五百餘件外，又有棉紗一千二百十件，該紗聞係香港英政府向中紡公司所配購。</p>
<h3>紗價挺俏</h3>
<p>昨日紗市初開平穩，嗣有散戶吸胃甚强，客幫見低添辦，去化一暢，市價即由徘徊而轉昂。各紗號均以當局限令出淸存紗之期將屆，故交易甚爲暢達，成交七百餘包，行情四十二支與二十支紗軋升二三十萬元，十六支紗則升降互見。</p>
<h3>棉布漲風未戢</h3>
<p>昨日棉布交易仍盛，塲上做開仍以現貨較夥，蓋出口船位有餘，客帮補購不寂。十二磅龍頭細布曾做高至三十六萬六千元，最後價爲四千元。五福細布二十四萬九千元有成交，最後做高至二十五萬二千元。四君子金印元嗶嘰棧單價喊二十三萬五千元，買戶吸進不少。北帮客人則吸收現貨，染廠家以售出色布購進二十支無牌細布，價由二十一萬元步升至二十一萬六千元。漂布本街有納胃甚健，做價續昂。其他色布及士林布仍平穩。昨紡建照例開售布疋，二十支特細布仍爲十五萬九千元，挨號配給，三A彩球細布二十一萬八千元，限於廠家請購，四君子元嗶嘰金印爲二十三萬三千元。</p>
<h3>絲綢交易稀少</h3>
<p>昨市絲綢市况頗沉靜，交易極稀。人造絲一二〇號天橋開盤四百五十萬元，最大價爲六百萬元，收盤做五百八十萬元。下午稍疲，最後喊五百五十萬元，結果與上日價軋平。七五號金鷄半光喊價竟到二千四百萬元，惟乏人過問。廠經昨市甚靜，交易寥寥。E字等級做價二千萬元，餘乏成交。綢市昨陷停頓狀態中，因價過高，買戶却步。大誠格子髪縐現貨做三萬四千五百元，單子貨未做，其餘喊價均站定未更。</p>
<h3>聯總運華棉花　總數達十一萬包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：聯總抵滬之棉花，總數迄已達十一萬包。尙有三萬五千包，亦已裝船來華。以上數額，已無問題。目前正在接洽運華之棉花，尙有十八萬包至廿萬包云。</p>
<h3>麵粉業要求政府　迅速解決原料供應</h3>
<p>採購小麥貸款業已暫停動用</p>
<p>麵粉業公會負責人昨吿記者稱：我國小麥供應，以往在此靑黃不接時期，皆由洋麥維持各廠開工。現產地存量甚少，洋麥尙無進口消息，致國內小麥市塲具有二大特徵，即價格特別高昂，供應時期意外久遠。國際麥產本年豐收，中信局購料處業經由國際糧食會議向阿根廷訂購小麥十萬噸，談判積極進行中，最近期內當有決定。近日國際市場小麥與麵粉價格比例以一比一·五二爲準，國內昨日無錫麥價每磅二一二〇元，粉價每磅一八八〇元，二者價格一比一·三二，較國外市場規定標準爲低，更因目前一。五包本粉，可換秈米一石，致使麵粉廠經營爲難，已不僅上海一地爲然，新麥登塲，尙須二月，在此期本市供應，亟待解決，各廠以種種原因，對當局採購小麥貸款，業已暫停動用，現各廠所祈求於政府者，並非增加合法利潤，而係原料問題，吳市長此次出席全國物價會議，將予提出討論，今後配售可能全由糧部供應，如是則配額將再度核减云。</p>
<h3>杭州米市枯竭</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿九日電〕杭市米潮澎湃，前經糧食評議會法定，白米以十六萬元一担，廿八日硤石米價趨跌，廿九日杭郊湖墅糙米突漲至廿二萬元，杭市米業又吿無市，籮筐見底。</p>
<h3>天津糧食價狂漲</h3>
<p>〔本報天津廿九日電〕津糧價連日在漲，今日造驚人紀錄，計壽豐通粉每小袋十五萬元，稻米零售每斤三千元，玉米麵每斤一千元，街談巷議，盡對糧價問題吁嘆</p>
<h3>食糖一致上展</h3>
<p>昨糖市以現貨日薄，趨勢續緊，如秘魯細砂初升一萬元後又升一二萬元，已出四十大關。其他白糖亦隨高土糖一致上展，汕提青二十六萬五千元，黃崗靑廿六萬元，順德靑廿五萬元，刁靑廿四萬四五千元。興化白袋莊三十七萬元，簍莊三十六萬元。興赤廿六七萬元，海南赤廿二萬五千元至廿三萬五千元，升百分之十不一。</p>
<h3>外銷茶平疲</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市買戶依然非巧不取，而賣方受成本關係，不忍再度削小，是以雙方談判之結果，又趨優持。全市祗由汪裕泰及午昌茶葉公司，對於三十五年三幫中祁門稍加染指外，餘均寂寞。價格方面則徘徊如故。至於各種內銷茶，去化亦乏憂額，過程平靜非凡。惟去年度白琳紅茶，營口幫之胃納突佳，交易復活，迄收市止共計成交一千餘箱，價每担自十七萬元至廿二萬元不等，形勢在進出平衡下，一致站住。又訊：邇來杭州各路之新龍井，到貨旣多，品質則日見蒼老，同業互做價頻下游，然人心不衰，市氣仍明跌暗平。</p>
<h3>火油售價挺升</h3>
<p>火油市價，近以公司配貨稀少，致經理行號現貨供售吿缺，聞棧單價一部份經售店有以散裝每桶四十六萬元收進，加鐵聽每以一萬八千元，故聽油售價頓吿挺升，昨日聽油已達七萬元云。</p>
<h3>桂圓荔枝俱貴</h3>
<p>雜路桂圓因乏到軋缺，市勢再緊。昨號方有小數開出，又升一成弱。普通陳元肉亦破百萬大關，蘭竹枝升一二成。</p>
<h3>全國紡織協會　明日舉行年會</h3>
<p>全國紡織事業協會第十二次年會，將於明日（五月一日）在逸園召開，各地代表現已報到，所提各案，正由會中分組審核中，該協會經數度集議後，協會本身亦擬就提案三件，（一）反對日本棉紡製成品輸華，（二）增產國棉，（三）改善管制辦法。準備提經大會通過後，呈中樞當局，作爲全國紡織業之建議云。</p>
<h3>戶口糖五一開始　每斤訂價二千一百元</h3>
<p>本市計口配糖，五月一日起，正式恢復。配售辦法，與上次相同。市社會局已指定南貨店三百七十餘家，負責供應，每人每月限購一斤。購糖證由保田人員按戶發給，各南貨店將糖購出後，即憑購糖證與台糖公司結帳。此次糖價每斤定爲二千一百元，台糖公司售與各南貨店每斤則爲一千七百二十五元，各南貨店可獲三百七十五元之利潤。全市人口計有三百五十萬人，本期可配出三百五十萬斤。</p>
<h3>財次徐柏園申述　四聯總處貸款概況</h3>
<p>總數約八千至一萬億元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部次長徐柏園，昨在聯合徵信所招待記者席上，曾就各報社提出之問題，作廣泛之答覆，茲分誌其大要如次：</p>
<p>（甲）關於四聯總處業已核辦貸款之種類及其數額，徐氏就記憶所及，共述十一種及其大致之貸款額：（一）國營工礦事業貸款，約二千億元。（二）民營工礦事業貸款，約一千億元。（三）交通事業貸款，一千五百億元。（四）公用事業貸款，五百億元。（五）出口貿易物資貸款，總數約在二千億元之譜。（六）媒礦貸款，總額在二百億元左右。（七）糧食工業貸款，總額約三百億元。（八）農貸，總額約在三千億元以上。（九）地方政府財務貸款，總額自二百五十億至三百億元。（十）文化敎育事業貸款，總額約三四百億元。（十一）鹽貸，總額約在二千億元之譜。</p>
<p>（乙）以上所述各種已核貸之貸款總額，約在八千億元至一萬億之譜。四聯總處過去核放之各種貸款，到期後大多均能如期淸償。比較顯著之呆帳僅一筆，即勝利時後方民族工業界因物價普跌時所申貸之款項，迄仍轉期延未淸償。</p>
<p>（丙）上年核貸之生產貸款案件，其貸款現已收回四分之一。查該項貸款，大部均將到期。四聯總處規定貸款期限爲三個月者，得申請展期一個月。貸款期限爲六個月者，不得再由請展期。</p>
<p>（丁）四聯總處上年核准之貸款案件，共計一千八百餘起，本年已核准者將滿六百起。</p>
<p>（戊）四聯總處與中央銀行貼放委員會之工作方針，並不衝突。蓋四聯總處負責各行局核發貸款頭寸之調度，而國行貼放委會則負責一般市塲頭寸之調度，故兩者之工作，係互爲表裏，互爲扶助。</p>
<p>（已）解決物價問題之首着，仍應從抑低利息入手，同時應制止投機，能如是，則中央銀行始能以充份資金，供應生產事業，使生產事業趨於活潑化。</p>
<h3>上海市銀樓業　同業公會成立</h3>
<p>上海市銀樓業同業公會，昨假市商會大禮堂，召開成立大會，出席會員代表百餘人，市黨部代表周濂澤，社會局代表封廣甲，市商會代表嚴　　等列席指導，大會開始，行禮列儀後，主席團即分別報吿籌組經過，繼即討論通過銀樓業營業日規，並選舉理監事，結果吳彭年，裘云艮，陳德彰，姚桂卿，孫介俊，王敬初等十一人當選爲理事，馮淸庵，李翼孫，趙恩波等三人當選爲監事，同時復推選吳彭年，裘云艮，陳德彰三人爲常務理事，吳彭年爲理事長，最後，會員臨時緊急動議，主張向中樞當局再度請願，要求更改已頒之處理銀樓業辦法，或以後銀樓業之飾金原料，由國行配給，經全體通過，旋即散會。</p>
<h3>海關辦公時間　五月一日起更改</h3>
<p>〔本報訊訊〕江海關頃公吿：自本年五月一日起至六月底止除星期日及例假日外改訂辦公時間爲每日上午八時至十二時下午二時至六時云。</p>
<h3>聯合徴信所　昨招待報界</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合徵信所經理刁民仁，昨爲使各界明瞭該所目前工作情况起見，特在該所招待本市新聞界。刁氏即席報吿該所係由中中交農四行聯合辦事總處理事會決議設立，於民國三十四年三月，在重慶正式成立，以調查工礦貿易交通金融各業情形，培植工商信用，促進其互助合作爲宗旨。勝利後，於卅四年十一月，將總所遷滬，現設外灘中國銀行大廈九樓，並在河南路三〇三號設立發行所。該所內部現分總務，調查，新聞，英文四組。迄目前爲止，已分在北平，天津，南京，南昌，漢口，重慶，設立分所。廣州分所，正籌設中，滬，京，漢，渝，平，津各分所，且均已發刋徵信新聞云。</p>
<h3>過去三個月內　滬港桐油輸出統計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本年一二三月份上海及香港兩地輸出於世界各地之桐油總額，已達二〇一六八·六〇噸（每噸合二二四〇磅。）此中特以一月份之輸出量尤多，其後逐月遞减。聞自三月下旬起，即因桐油國內外市價發生倒掛，無法輸出。美國市價，自每磅三角八分，逐步回跌至三角以內。正常價格，最多不過三角四分。再查歐美各國，戰後對桐油之消費量，均急遽遞减。以美國言，戰前每月消費量，月需五午噸，現僅月需二千五百噸，且戰後美國，已習用桐油之代用品，無形又减少桐油之需要量。而三個月每月輸美之桐汕量，均在四五千噸以上。是以國外市價，一時無法振作。茲將三月來上海香港兩地桐油輸往國外之數量，分誌如次：（單位噸）</p>
<p>一四噸，歐洲計一九〇四噸，英國計二五五〇噸，一二三月份上海香港兩地輸出世界會地之總額計二〇一六九噸。</p>

<h3>延安的「馬奇諾」　陜北散記（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者羣華</p>
<p>延安十六日快訊</p>
<p>自和談破裂，周恩來匆匆回延，毛澤東召開擴大幹部軍事緊急會議，周氏大放厥辭，吶喊「擴大解放戰爭」，中共早已於去年十一月十五日下總動員令及疏散令，積極備戰，各縣壯丁，一律編隊，其稍有訓練身體健壯者，或編爲菸幹隊，或擴補獨立敎導等旅團，至其年事稍長，或認爲不大可靠者，則編爲自衛隊，担架隊，及運輸隊等，基幹隊以上，一律配備較優武器，自衛隊以下，武器較差，但已做到全部壯丁十九都武裝起來了的程度。機關幹部則除武裝之外，並加緊防空敎育，尤其對傘兵的防禦戰，每天都要實地講解演習。三月初旬以後，情勢緊張，幾乎無日不上山對空警戒，如臨大敵一樣。同時積極增兵，陳賡·蕭勁光等部，均紛紛從曾冀豫方面回調，最後，賀龍亦率部動王，總共調集兵力，連民兵在內，共有三師十三旅十四獨立團十個支隊，合共達十六萬餘人，並且成立了保衛邊區動員委員會，於三月初召開羣衆大會，宣佈緊急動員，號召堅決「保衛延安」，所有老弱均移後方，陝甘寗邊區政府遷至安寨，中共中央遷瓦　堡，眷屬及食糧物資——特別是大烟土——則運儲於保安。其決心背城一戰，圖誘國軍深入在延安外圍，以完成其保衛戰，可謂已嘔盡心血了。</p>
<p>此外，還實施了普遍的堅壁清野工作，在延安以南地區，所有足供國車軍需之用的糧食牲畜等，均搬移一空，人民被脅迫撤走，傢具器物，則爲它的部隊用以燒飯，或改作担架。所以，國軍初到，十室九空，民衆的痛苦，實非筆墨可以形容。這雖然給國軍以困難，而中共之失敗却於此註定了。</p>
<p>延安之迅速光復，雖然是攻其不備的出奇制勝戰略的成功，但中共是老於運動戰的，爲什麽老不能轉敗爲勝，敗得這樣慘呢？陝北這樣有利的地理條件，中共又是擅作內綫戰的，如果只是軍事部署上的一個錯誤，中共絕對可以在發覺以後很快就改變過來，何况毛澤東朱德的計劃根本毫無退出陝北之意，反而企圖在延安附近殲減國軍的主力，但事實的發展，中共敗得連脚都收不住，反擊也一次都沒有，這究竟是什麼道理呢？</p>
<p>從人民與投誠人員的訴述裏，我們已經發覺，延安的被光復，三分之二是中共自身政治上的「搞錯」了所致。軍事的失措，不過是推波助瀾罷了。</p>
<p>中共一向是以政治指導軍事，以政治條件決定軍事的戰略與戰術的，這次戰略戰術的錯誤運用，自然也不能例外，毛澤東心裏毫無疑義的對他生聚敎訓了十三年的陝北羣衆，和他倚爲心腹的一二〇師，三五八旅，三五九旅等所謂生產部隊的忠實與革命熱情，是絕對認爲成熟了的，他根據這些估計，在政治上當然確信在羣衆的堅決協同作戰下，絕對可以使國軍之進攻延安，一如過去江西的進剿一樣，要隨處遭敵，隨處被暗算，而終於在所謂革命軍民的聯合反擊下歸於毀滅的。投誠，不抗抵，潰散，是決不會有的事，防綫與僻險區的情形，國軍更不會知曉，所以他們退出延安時，一點都沒有破壞，他們實在堅決相信，延安決不會失守，即或暫時失守，也會很快就收復的，因而他們才有誘「敵」深入，企岡在延安附近殲滅國軍的計劃，那知他們完全弄錯了。</p>
<p>在他們的鴉片經濟政策之下，幹部肥了，對革命惶惑了。那些農民出身的老幹部，心境那有毛澤東那樣老練透澈，十數年的艱苦鬥爭，得到了些什麼？於是大胆貪汚了，有了幾個密而不宣的錢——烟土·黃金。動搖了，但又不能決然摔掉組織關係，如是由矛盾而踟蹰，由踟蹰而註定了被圍投誠，被俘自新。這次專門種烟的生產部隊三五八，三五九兩旅，被俘的特別多，敗得也特別慘——朱德就是爲此而大哭——便是明顯的證明。</p>
<p>人民呢？對種鴉片自然不能承認是革命的生產，對它的佔據土地，不能生產正糧，則是十分討紙，而鬥地掠糧，給地交人　壯丁），雖然有些人得到了一些利益，但要付出一條命，結無數冤仇，做多少虧心事，則保守的農民，內心裏總是有一種說不出的矛盾。</p>
<p>此外，無條件的親蘇反美，把反美和親蘇生硬的和愛國聯接起來，把割據的「山大王」作法和「民主」等量齊觀，把戰亂與和平揉成一塊，把勝利寄望於毫無把握的蘇聯的援助，這也是其幹部與羣衆所最疑慮的，直接間接都影響它的戰鬥力和動員的強度。</p>
<p>此次共軍三五八·三五九兩旅主力部隊被全部摧毀，俘虜竟達一萬三千餘人，整個軍心，不免草木皆兵，因之國軍乘勝挺進，所向無敵。自然，沒有國軍將士的英勇奮鬥，沒有胡長官與盛參謀長的奇謀神算，出其不意的堅決取道險地，向宜用延長和洛川延安兩綫之間地區猛進，迂廻合擊，摧毀大小勞山的馬奇諾，也是不行的。</p>
<p>說句老實話，撤退是有計劃的，放棄却是沒有的事。這就是說毛澤東他們沒有根本撤出陝北之意向，撤退只是避免轟炸損失和誘「敵」深入的戰鬥程序之一，只是表明他們以延安爲口袋，準備在延安附近展開慘烈的殲滅戰之決心而已。</p>
<p>這是一件怪耐人尋味的事：延安的建築，除了楊家陵中央大禮堂後面圖的藏書樓燒掉以外，其餘都毫無破損。毛澤東等中共要人的住宅·牀舖·桌椅·圍屛。沙發以及霄橱等，都沒搬走，只是把牀上舖的，沙發上的彈簧和套布，圍屛上的襯布，書架上的書籍等拿走而已，爲什麼延安不堅壁淸野一下呢？留給胡宗南將軍享用，討個人情嗎？道除了退出時的過於倉皇以外，再沒有更好的解釋。</p>
<p>延安的攻守戰，最初是中共方面先動手的，先動手的中共部隊，大部都自晋綏方面回調而來，旣預備撤退，何必千里迢迢調來，再說，陝北這塊地區，戰略地位實極重要，胡宗南將軍的數十萬大兵，數年來便被它牽制住，在地理形勢上又是「進可以攻，退可以守」，而且是山西方面的屏障，毛澤東决不會這樣傻，把這塊具有極大戰略意義的「陝甘寗邊區」拱手鑲人，讓胡宗南來咬自已。爲什麼又被追得收不住晦，連廣播電台·印刷機·鉛字等貴重而切需的東西都扳掉呢？以及保安的兵工廠爲何不預先搬走呢？有計劃的放棄和撤退是這樣的嗎？</p>
<p>賀龍及其參謀長所發之作字第十四號通報，指示共軍要死守延安是千眞萬確的事實，大小勞山之戰，共軍被殲滅四個團，其死拚也可知。毛澤東直到十七日才撤退，朱德則於延安失陷前幾小時才含淚北去，這些都證明着延安之有計劃放棄云云，是沒有的事，而被打得抱頭鼠竄，則是百分之百的事實。</p>
<p>陳長官招待記者之神情　（特派員江暮雲攝寄）</p>
<h3>陳儀長官　與記者們話別</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>台灣廿三日航訊</p>
<p>四月廿二日的政院例會，決定了陳儀長官離開了台灣，離開了光復第一任的長官的交椅。</p>
<p>記者很奮興地向新聞室張延哲沈雲龍兩主任建議，希望長官能給記者們一次談話，他倆很高興的答應轉陳，就這樣決定了我們和陳儀長官的「話別」。</p>
<p>推行新政策　反動勢力強大</p>
<p>廿四日下午三時，台北賓館出現了御赭色西裝，鬢髮蒼白，滿臉紅暈的老人的影子，他仍是那樣健步，兩目出神的向記者們招呼。他點着頭說，台幣一對四十決定了，這是好容易和中央爭得來的結果。</p>
<p>同行中都願意傾聽他治台一年半來的感想，他說：「客觀的看法是有好多還沒有做到，這有許多原因，因爲環境關係，現在還不好說。」</p>
<p>他帶着深度的隱痛，引用歷史的史實來說明反動勢力的滋長。他列舉歷史傳統的秦，漢，宋各代，在推行新政策時，例須遭有的大反動，雖然這種新政策結果還是在推行。他指出有三抓人，其一是有作爲的改變時代環境的前進人物；其二是壞人，權奸；其三是大多數不好不壞，不作聲，寫寫漂亮文章說漂亮話的，這種人在二千年來歷史的傳統裏不打緊，因爲循環的；可是現在就不行，要寬大，要進步。他更以英國爲例，說明多數民衆具有力量。而蘇聯政府就可以控制。在中國，一種爲大多數人民謀福利的政策，不一定能得到大多數人民的擁護，可是與少數特殊階級的地主士大夫們發生利害衝突時，這種反動勢力的力量却相當大，也無法防止它。所以他堅毅地認定要求進步不怕猜疑，妬忌，要養成不怕犧牲的精神，同時要輿論界支持。</p>
<p>兩件新工作　願獻給新主席</p>
<p>長官治台有理想，有憧憬。對於幹部們應該做的工作表示滿意。去年度省財政虧空，放下一筆大資產，新主席來，財政可不必擔心事。對於公營事業，專賣，貿易，他只是說：「不做，財政可不得了，工廠不冒烟，學校不開門，六百多件水利工程就無法做，而人民的捐稅也擔負不了。」他以「看起來緊，實在不能不做」的苦衷未闡明外界對「經濟尺度緊政治尺度寬」的批評。</p>
<p>下半年度有兩件事是打算在他治台的計劃裏的，首先是從海外和內地歸來十萬六千人中佔二分之一的失業者，决計給他們以工程隊的編制，從事於建設工作，其次是失學的小孩，給他們以吃飯的本領。他主張義務敎育要九年，三年相同於初中程度，畢業後可以在各個職業部門裏找到職業，這個計劃，顯然遭到頓挫，但他願意供獻給新主席實施。</p>
<p>他更坦白地說，應付日本時代的御用紳士，皇民會份子，壞的洗氓，和走私一樣，沒有辦法。中國沒有法律可以作爲從嚴處罰或放逐火燒島的根據；送進法院，至多拘押二三個月便釋放了，這種不能切合事實的法理，只有迫使大家不做事，馬馬乎乎，在這一個環境下要求進步，要求改革政治是困難的。</p>
<p>對新聞界　自認犯老毛病</p>
<p>席間記者們所最關心的是自己切身的事。長官强調地說：他信仰自由，一年半來支持着言論集會出版的自由，一切講自由，結果發生了二二八大亂子，這種脫節的自由，應趕快改變彌補。重視新聞界，新聞界也要自重，他更肯定說明要責成一個宣傳機構來單獨負起全般的宣傳重任是困難的，必得要全體協力，多方面的注意，而且要集中起來大規模做，多做建設工作，不存領袖慾，爲大家服務。</p>
<p>中央社葉主任，以長官治閩時對新聞界的能度，要求他回憶來台時所說「先儘量採納與情」的話，予以再檢討。他說：「我　是犯了老毛病。」接着是：「在福建當時，許多人不能諒解我，離開以後却在懷念我，這在個人團無得失，而在國家却是損失。」</p>
<p>在他的憧憬裏，深信這中國的領土的台灣底前途是光明的。他愛護台灣，更愛護善良的大多數的台灣同胞。輿論對於堅苦自守的研究實騐工作者，要給予精神的安慰。盲目的指摘貪汚腐敗，只有更增加心緒的不寗。在他一生中，不怕困難，不怕寃枉，更不知灰心，者番離台，其積極精神正和離開時一樣。</p>
<p>長官公署　將成歷史陳跡</p>
<p>並時，長官和記者們在本報的攝影鏡頭完畢後一一握手吿別，我們看着他堅毅沉着賢明結實的背影在大雨滂沱中離去。每個人都在預計着在一二週後新省主席來時將隨之而消逝的「長官公署」和「長官」的稱謂，陳儀長官也將在這時暫時離開台灣。</p>
<p>長官的面影，風格是否將像治閩時一樣給人們以回憶以愛戴呢？在他的政治生命中是否以治合一年半的事實作爲主要的評價呢？其所堅持執行的經濟政策是成功，是失敗？而二二八事變是否是他個人和幹部們所能担負的過咎呢？……在這些問題裏，記者所能得到的答案，祇是在政局動盪國家未能獲致統一的現在，以刻苦自勵忠於國族的有理想的行政工作者，在實施與大多數人有利益的政策時，因爲不能防止反動勢力的波浪，不能獲得大多數人的擁護，而首先被犧牲了。其代價是：給後來者和國家以嚴厲的敎訓。</p>
<p>顯然的，在他有血有淚的談話裏，其痛苦更甚於所表露的心聲。記者們將目送陳儀長官匆匆離去，更將歡迎狹新抱負以來的新主席底蒞臨；眞是有感慨，有惋惜，有熱望！</p>
<p>台灣省的政治總樞紐長官公署，即將改為省政府。（特派員江暮雲寄）</p>

<h3>市內交通請整數事</h3>
<p>編輯先生；宜昌路西蘇州路各一段工廠林立，交通衝要，而通路破壞，高低不平，一經天雨，積潦成潭，泥漿四濺，嵮波不堪。在曩時有十九路，及廿一路無軌電車，行駛三洋涇橋與戈登路底造幣廠橋間，自日寇進佔租界後，爲收括物資，竟將電綫拆除，光復迄今時逾年半，迄未見電車公司舖設恢復，至目下搭車，必須至長壽路江寗路口或大自鳴鐘，居民工友，往返跋涉，莫不嘖嘖怨尤，爰請市政當局，除將道路趕速修整外，並飭英商電車公司設法恢復，或添駛公共汽軍，以利交通，實爲德便。（魯景淸）</p>
<p>又一函：吳淞路底虬江路口，日前有閘北水電公司修理自來水管，所有之石子路面，被破壞後，未復原狀，來往車輛時虞傾覆，祈賢明當局即速派員勘修，以利民行。（獨廉）</p>
<h3>請禁學校門前擺攤</h3>
<p>攤版生活的淸苦是人所共知的，尤其是去年因遭當局之取締而引起巨大的風波，更博得了大衆的同情，然攤販擺攤之所在地，當以適當之塲所而不妨礙觀瞻者爲限，若在學校門前擺攤，那非但不是適當的塲所，並且有礙觀瞻，茲將其理由概述於下：</p>
<p>學校是施敎育的機關，絕對不能使學生義成浪費的習慣，有少數學校門禁不嚴，學生進出自由，而其門前設有零食攤子，無與是鼓勵學生浪費金錢，亂買零食極不衛生，此與敎育本旨適得其反。且有些不良的攤子，竟含有賭博的意義一般莘莘學子們，一下了課，都圍聚在這些攤子傍，把金錢孤注一擲，上課時則無心聽講，一心只在這種攤子上，貽害學子，殊非淺鮮，本人身歷其境，故知之綦詳，若一旦有外賓參觀學校，見其門前列有攤子亦甚有礙觀瞻也，是以深望警局嚴禁攤販在學校門擺攤，並望學校當局在上課時間內禁止學生自由出入，以重校風，並使學生養成良好節儉的習慣。（張宗禮）</p>
<h3>滿街乞丐應請注意</h3>
<p>本市最近發現大批「乞丐」，且多壯年人和小孩，北方口音，三三二二，手提猢猴，喇叭竹笙挨戶乞討，一批走去，不到廿分鐘又是一批，川洗不息，散處各街道上。以前乞丐在南京路及外灘黃浦區一帶，除紅廟左近可說絕對沒有，可是最近二月來却不然，此項乞丐，在南京路外灘一帶，會推開大商號，寫字間之門，邊吹邊討，觀瞻所擊，治安市容，均雖聽而不顧，希望當局注意及之。（黃海濤）</p>
<h3>搶救紹興失學兒童</h3>
<p>編者先生：我越淪陷的時候敵僞微暴歛，十室九空及勝利來臨，而這整個農村，已如枯敗的草木，元氣一時恢復不轉來，談到敎育，經費先無法籌措，雖然縣政府規定，每保要辦一所小學，然而等于具文，就是有的勉强辦了起來，多數的家長，都因爲出不起學費，買不起書本，任小輩荒廢學業。</p>
<p>誰都知道，兒童是下一代的主人翁，無論國和家，都寄予一分希望，要達到這希望，非敎育他們不可，現在我紹許多許多學齡兒童，都因爲經濟關係而受不到敎育，將來他們如何能够担當這國家主人翁的責任，所以我寫這封信，希望社會賢達來發起，籌募些基金，在農村辦幾所義務小學，這是造福我越兒童，也就是造福未來的社會和國家。（何仲謀）</p>

<h3>臯橋</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>陟彼北邙兮，噫！顧瞻帝京兮，噫！宮闕崔　兮，噫！民之劬勞兮，噫！遼遼未央，兮噫！</p>
<p>這就是梁鴻的立噫詩，古今無二的至文，一種澈骨凄楚的長嘆息。當時梁鴻東出關，過洛陽，作這首詩。「肅宗——後漢章帝——聞而悲之，求鴻不得。」因爲梁鴻已經和他的夫人孟光，推着一部小車子，一逕南下，走着泰伯虞仲的舊路綫，到了蘇州，他到蘇州以後，就住在皋橋，那橋是皋伯通的房子。這一對夫婦，以勞力白給，「賃春」，寄居在皋家廡下。這樣，章帝又到那裏找人呢。又不知道經過多久。因爲這一對夫婦，相敬如賓，孟光舉桉齊眉。有一天給皋伯通看見，聳然驚異，以爲必非平常人。他一詢問，明白了底細，　大加敬禮。皋橋這一地名，便流傳到如今。</p>
<p>舉桉齋眉是一個極有名的事故。桉是盛食器，搬食物上來，並不隨手擱下，却鄭重其事地擺好，彷彿當着尊貴的賓客似的。這就是舉桉齋眉的原義。因爲按通常寫作案，便誤會作八仙桌；於是孟光弄成力大無窮，可以一手把桌子舉起來了。然而這一笑話也是古已有之，早成了歷史了。</p>
<p>從　門入城，沿馬路向東行，不到一里地，有一道洋灰的平橋，過橋是公共汽車站，橋頭有電料行水菓店之類。那形式恰恰是現代都市裏最常見的東西，然而那是千九百年前隱者和詩人的故迹，那就是皋橋。蘇州是全國惟一保存古老地名的城市。如葑鬥，胥門，要離坊，虎邱之類，遠的到兩千五百年。皋橋還不算頂占老的，當然現在早已面目全非了。然而孔融不是說過嗎「雖無老成人，尙有典型。太史公不是說過嗎，「高山仰止，景行行止。雖不能至，而心嚮往之。」留了幾個地名，豈不是還可以令後人仰景嚮往。發生無限想像嗎。</p>
<p>皋橋正値閶門西街，步盡這條小街就是桃花塢西口。閶門西街那一帶是早上的菜市，我差不多有一半的日子提着菜籃到　橋附近，也往往走橋上過。以前聽人口說，以爲是高橋，漠不注意。近來纔知道是皋橋，究竟也還是少讀書。事後想起來，廋信的哀江南賦，「下亭飄泊，高橋覊旅」兩句正寫作「高」橋。這以後我再打那橋上經過，便有着異樣的感想，洋灰鐵欄的橋面，上面走着汽車，無綫電收音機終日噴着粗俗的歌聲。底下是一條骯　不大流動的水。就在這地方，千九百年前，有隱逸大德曾終生活過，以他們的生活表示一種極其高遠的理想。這一種行逕，表面上似乎是消極的，却在我國文化上造成無比的影響。</p>
<p>章帝時候，後漢國力正盛，班超揚威西域，政治也還淸明。祗是歷史家却看出那時候已經造成一些不良的趨勢。梁鴻的五噫，到底是從政治的遠見，抑或從另外一種基本的見解發出感慨來的？似以後者更近實情。這一首詩，語氣頗爲微婉，還不如賈誼劉向的奏疏來得激昂。然而那情緒是是很悲凉的，尤其首末兩句。北邙山是什麽地方呢？那是自古以來達官貴人埋骨的地方。今日正卒受着崔巍的宮闕，也許明天就要到北邙山去與陳死人爲伍了。而人民的勞苦却並不消滅，還是一代又一代繼續下去。章帝到底不失英明，這　「聞而悲之。」</p>
<p>但帝王和隱逸究竟在兩個完全不同的世界裏。縱然心頭怦怦然跳動了一次，却無法改贊過來，梁鴻也知道，所以悄悄地走了，以行動表示他的理想。所以這一首詩，不止對政治的控訴而已，乃是根本反對政治。旣有帝京，便不能不造成崔巍的宮闕，使不能不壓迫人民，奪取其所有。人民的劬勞，使永無終止之日。則這一首詩的涵義，正和伯夷的西山歌相等，又遠比賈劉來得激烈而澈底了。</p>
<p>隱逸是我國政治上一種特殊而又偉大的理想。許由務光一流人物難不可考，伯夷叔齊却彰彩著明。「以暴易暴兮，不知其非矣。」是澈底反對政治的。無論桀紂之暴，湯武之仁，但一涉及政治，便都是一樣的東西，所謂以至仁伐至不仁者，在夷齊眼中，以另外一種更高的襟準來評判，仍然是一例的暴。此後如荷篠丈人，抱　灌園，楚狂接與，長沮桀溺一班人物，就是孔子也不能菲薄他們。祗是慨嘆地說：「天下有道，丘不與易也。」</p>
<p>我不知道政治究竟是不是人類最高的境界，如亞里士多德所說人爲政治的動物者，也許這祗是一種過渡的方法，人類或者終於會走到一種完全不需要政治的境界。這是太大了的問題，目前無從談起，一時的事實是：我們無從離開政治，而政治又每每發生缺點，甚至造成罪惡。從歷史上看，政治究竟能不能功過相抵的這一筆帳眞是無從結算。所以我國便產生了兩種偉大的政治理想。一種是不擾民，所謂政簡刑淸，疏網闊目，把政治的範圍畫量縮小，孔子「導之以德，齊之以禮」的理論也是限制政治活動的。又一種則爲隱逸思想，否認政治底至高無上。舉過不大確切的譬喩來說，好像是史汀生的不承認主義。儘管你閙得轟轟烈烈。我德是不理會。儘管你得到成功，我總認作暴力，則那種成功總得不到堅實的基礎，始終是一時的。看來這像是消極，却是從根底上毁滅了對方的基礎。</p>
<p>就因爲這樣，我國直到元代異族統治時纔發生絕對專制。隱逸之存在，使帝王消失了最高無上的地位，祗能取得一種相對的地位。千九百年前，處在遼遠的江南荒僻地方有兩個勞工，寄居在人家的雜院子裏，（那時候沒有自己的住屋的人等於今日沒有屋住在街頭流浪的人）靠額上流汗來混飯吃，但他們的地位却和帝王相等，他們的力量也和帝王相等。有了這一類人，我國古代的帝王纔不敢爲所欲爲。從政的人們，也不以服事帝王爲最大目的。不事王侯，又何止一種個人底高尙？這是一種澈底的反抗和控訴。</p>
<p>然而到了千九百年後的今日，皋橋這一地名，或者祗對於怱忽忙忙上下公共汽車的人有着意義罷。每天每天，橋上流水似的車輛與橋下的流水各不相于地走着，沒有誰會對於這樣一座太平常了白橋發生任何聯想罷？在這時候，也許祗有少數人對於政治不會有或多或少的不滿足罷。則我們，在這一個時代的人，究竟應該學孔子那樣，以爲「鳥獸不可與同羣，吾非斯人之徒而誰與？」因之無論這個世界好壞與否，總得去分担一分責任，因以分享一分權利呢？還是，步隱逸者的後塵，斷然放棄一切享受而作澈底的控訴呢？這是要取決於各人自己的，不可强求。但有一點却是確定的：即，旣取一分享受，便當担一分責任，却不可以祗取享受，於是站在旁邊說風凉話</p>
<p>我幾乎有一半的日子都提着菜籃子在皋橋近邊走，每當提了一滿籃芥菜春筍，黄魚鹽　之類，覺得手臂有一點吃力的時候，便想到恐怕會爲梁鴻所笑。我住在桃花塢，便旣無唐伯虎那樣的才學，更無他那樣的資力，因此不敢放誕風流。也沒有梁鴻那樣的氣力，可以靠額上流汗來糊口；因此也不敢以隱逸自居，還得在人羣裏面混日子。想起「畏首畏尾，身其餘幾」的話來，不禁好笑。因此連牢騷也不敢發，袛有偶有暇時，放下了紙筆的時候，也不禁曼聲吟滿五噫，而懷着悠遠的遐想。</p>
<h3>山水</h3>
<p>— 張之阿</p>
<h3>「孽海花」的續作者</h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>東亞病夫曾孟樸的名著「孼海花」小說，雖其本身終沒有完卷，但是早已就有了兩種緻作。茲據「晚淸小說史」內說：「一爲陸士　「新孼海花」（改良小說社，一九一〇），一爲包天笑「碧血慕」（小說林），一不稱，一未完。』而今又有了「續孼海花」一種，則是燕谷老人在抗戰期間，由其故鄕常熟避難至滬後所作。</p>
<p>其實我說過，若論「孼海花」的續作者，而在東亞病夫就是頭一個，因爲他後來在修改本的序內說，那本書的造意人是「愛自由者」金松岑，而且起首四五回，其原稿亦是金先做好了的，至於這在東亞病夫的一生，雖則從事寫作經過了二十多年，但到了最後，依其原來計劃且已擬定六十回全目，却只寫出了半數，而其餘的則已隨他逝去而永埋沒了。因又惜在「愛自由者」今逝去，雖是遲於東亞病夫之死十二年，而他卒未爲續作，有續作者則是燕谷老人張隱南。</p>
<p>至於燕谷老人的續作，到底如何呢？是否按照東亞病夫的原來計劃而續其未完的部分呢？因我至今還未看到了他的作品，固無從斷言。現在，我只想把這位燕谷老人來略爲一述，可說他也確是有資格爲「孽海花」的續作者。</p>
<p>燕谷老人亦是常熟的宿儒，姓張名鴻字隱南，與東亞病夫年相若，而爲總角交。到了晚年，又同居城內，時相過往，以詩酒唱和；，而張之所居燕谷園與曾之所居虛霧居，亦同具泉石花木之勝。不待言，以張對於「孼海花」書中的人物和故事，也都很熟悉，甚至於即寫作的計劃，在他亦多所與聞。</p>
<p>當東亞病夫逝世的前一年，即民國二十三年春，因東南五省舉行交通展覽會，將常熟縣亦調入風景區，乃令其整理名勝古　。時該縣縣長周衡，奉令之後，　召集地方紳士，然　進行，當經決定組織常熟縣整理名勝委員會，並雄定周縣長爲委員長（周旋辭職，由　桓繼任縣長），張隱南爲副委員長，而張復被推爲遊　指南編輯人之一，以此已可知其在地方上的聲望。</p>
<p>再說燕谷老人的詩文，亦略舉一二，以資管窺。時「虞山遊覽指南」是由潘稼孫主編，他亦爲題兩絕云：</p>
<p>「十里虞山生面開，林泉指點仗淸才；高情無異寒山上，夫婦搜嚴剔石來。」</p>

<p>其文如「環翠小築額跋」，到去年五月，我於戰後到常熟去與友遊公園，小憇環翠小築中，見其木刻尙完好存在。此文如左：</p>

<h3>談地方戲</h3>
<p>— 董每戡</p>
<p>崑曲到淸朝專登大雅之堂，而不能入所謂俗耳，但一切眞正的藝術該爲大衆所理解所接受，崑曲已遠離這基礎的條件，它的命運也就此決定了。到淸乾隆年間所謂各地的土戲便應運起來奪取了崑腔的地位，這時的人將崑腔稱爲「雅部」，其他均歸入「花部」了。而那些有錢的鹽商們就　養着兩部的戲子備隨時娛樂，例如「揚州畫舫錄」就如是記載：</p>
<p>「兩淮鹽務，例蓄花雅兩部，以備大戲。雅部即崑腔；花部爲京腔，秦腔，弋陽腔，梆子腔，羅羅腔，二簧調，統謂之亂彈」。</p>
<p>花部諸腔實際上不是新生出來的，有些腔調如弋陽腔在崑腔未出世前就流行過，在絕響時期有一支還保存在北方，以直隸的高陽爲立足點就變成高腔了，還有其他腔也是明朝早已有之的。</p>
<p>曲律：一數十年來又有弋陽義島靑陽樂平徽州諸腔出」。</p>
<p>魏良輔這話實足證明。當然，所謂花部勃興，量初還是秦腔，囉囉調，弋陽腔佔勢力，乾隆初年出的「夢中緣傳奇」序文中說：</p>
<p>「長安（指京師）之梨園稱盛……而所好惟　聲，囉（囉夕調），弋（弋陽腔），厭聽吳騷（指崑曲），聞歌崑曲，輒鬨然散去」。</p>
<p>由這些話可證明當時民衆厭「雅部」而喜「花部」的實情。皇帝脚下多貴族士大夫已到這種地步，他處更必然的愛花部諸腔，在南方一帶尤其徽州的優伶稱雄，徽班中雖也有他腔戲，但以徽調爲主，淸高宗南巡就聽過了南方的花部諸腔，大致很滿意，到乾隆五十五年微班也就進京了</p>
<p>「夢華瑣簿」：「三慶……乾隆五十五年庚戍，高宗八旬之萬壽節，入都祝釐，時稱三慶徽，是徽班之鼻祖」。</p>
<p>這祝釐不過是借口實乘機罷了。實則他們知道皇帝歡喜他們的演藝，就此發展到京師去，居然在短期之間就盛起來。到嘉慶時，成立了五部，計有三慶，四喜，和春，春台，三和等五個班子。當然，名雖爲徵班，優人的籍貫不一定全是徽州人，各處都有。在腔調方面到京都後便起變化，收衆腔之長，大家都兼習他　如京腔秦腔崑腔了，這五班以四大班爲最有名，且各有各的特長，據「金台殘淚記」所載，大致是：</p>
<p>「四喜」名曰「曲子」，因原擅長崑曲。</p>
<p>「三慶」名曰「軸子」，專演新排時事，連台大戲。</p>
<p>「和春」名曰「把子」，專演三國水滸等武戲。</p>
<p>「春台」名曰「孩子」，係孩兒班，故名。</p>
<p>當時各班除出演堂會外，就在戲園裏演，據說「戲莊演劇必徵班，戲園之大者如廣德樓，廣和樓，慶樂園，三慶圍，亦必以徽班爲主，下此則徽班，小班，西班，相雜適均」。</p>
<p>這些戲劇能在淸代大盛而特盛，自然有它的原因：一因高宗屢次南巡調査民情，施政便得到致治的方法—剛柔兼施；不止戲劇，文學的燦爛期也被造或。二因商業資本愈發達，都市中需要娛樂的人愈增多。三因士大夫階層的變態，心理發達，戲子利用士大夫的權勢金錢，士大夫玩弄戲子的色藝了。四因喜新厭舊爲人之常情，况舊腔已不能娛人耳目。花部諸腔因此四種原因而盛，但戲劇藝術的價値也因此而　低。</p>
<p>一直到咸豐年間，徽班中出了安徽人程長庚，不止藝術高乎儕輩，而且在行政上也有能力，舊班子的好班規差不多都是他立的。他是皮黄戲界的「大老板」，工老生戲，唱做工夫，一時無四。和他齊名的只有張二奎余三勝二人，鼎足而三。但自乾隆至道光，都捧且角，自長庚出，始把惡潮流轉變，此功實不可滅沒。　他後又有譚鑫培，也是一位可推許的優人。然而小市民好藝術之心究不及好色，後來仍以且角</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　409</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「物以類聚，人以羣分」。通常，如要斷定這一羣人，是那一類，是什麽一羣；正的，邪的，良的，莠的，有志的，墮落的，祗要首先聽他們的言談，再逐一觀察一下各人的　　行動，譬如化學上的定性分析，最少可以確定一個九成。這是說其地其時有些不相宜，否則簡直可以確定一個十成之十。</p>
<p>這裏的一羣，以年齡而論，數到李明居長，然也不過三十歲邊沿。其次是守一，二十八歲正；再其次就要數到鶴見和正岩，兩人都是二十六七。最年靑的却是那位韓國志士，據說只有二十一歲。</p>
<p>論到體格儀表，五個人中，要推守一第一。據說他從前在日本留學的當口，日本女子都趕着稱他「美雄神」：五個人中，也算他身量最高，大約五呎九吋左右，站在一般西人之中，決定體格，誰也不敢把矮瘦兩字加在他身上。他的身材雖然這麽高，全部體格却又發展得那樣勻亭，與身量的高度，十分配合；南方笑人瘦長的「電木竿」北方山東唷鍋餅式「鐵塔」，「彪形大漢」，等等形容詞，却不能拿來描寫他。他長得那股恰合理想的標準體格。</p>
<p>再要提到武功方面；舊式的，他是覺厂老人最得意的子弟，自從五六歲開功，就一切納入正軌；鍊過悠本的內外功，拳母，又從專家練過達摩掌，蝦蟆功，搶拿乎，以及錯骨分筋的小玩藝。至於新式西洋拳擊，鬥劍，競走，跳擲，在他只是兒戲。槍擊，他練到「聽驟中的」，不僅不用瞄準，簡直可以不勞視覺。學歷方面，他拿過日本一等電機工程學位，又有二年的無綫電工廠實習。因爲一切素養都好，加之天性溫和，所以言談行動，以漂亮，而又是那們儒雅沉着。</p>
<p>至於韓方這位靑年志士，也是事亭一表，秀麗壯實，我用秀麗二字，也正因他長得實在像一位嬌好女子。然而聽說他的性格，却此炸彈還猛烈，同時還精於刺探技能。一切舉動，倒是大部分韓人一樣的樸吶。</p>
<p>（這裏筆者始終沒有提到這位韓國志士的姓名，十分愧恨；却有兩個原因：一，鶴見當日對我叙述這一次會集人物的時候，他旣未曾說到姓名，我也疎忽，忘記追問。現在雖想問他，他跑到那們荒　的所在去了，又是那等消沉，即令寫信去問，恐怕也無結果。</p>
<p>二，到上海之後，我曾經遇見過兩位韓籍同學，從前也是韓國革命同志，曾經向他們探聽過這位少年姓名，據說像這位少年同志一般年紀，一般像貌的，共有好幾位，却一位一位在上海淪陷中，都因地下工作中而流血犧牲了。有的姓金，有的姓閔，有的……等等。當日那位老革命領袖，又早已病逝，更是無法根詢。</p>
<h3>狄更斯演說</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>有一次，英國名小說家狄再斯在曼徹斯透舉行演講，竭力攻豐當時社會盛行着的「淺學可危論」（A　Little　Learning　is　dengerous）。</p>
<p>他大聲地講道：「房屋和田地雖然給不了他們，可是，學識還是可以給一點房屋和田地以外的東西。」</p>
<h3>伊與我沙白的手</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>英儲君伊麗沙白公主的誕辰，是四月廿一日，她今年才廿一歲，在英國熱烈舉行成年慶祝禮的時候，她向全國廣播她最優美的演講了。</p>
<p>這位廿一歲的未來女王，不但有會演講的口，而且有會勞動的手，時代究竟不同了，她不復以高量的　　玉手自豪，像中國古代詩人歌頌那些貴族女人的手，說什麽「手如柔　，膚如凝脂」了。</p>
<p>她的手是怎樣的呢？據其報的特寫中說：</p>
<p>「……她晚上睡在宮內，白天在油和機器中工作，她最喜歡把指甲弄髒了，手上塗滿油，給她的朋友翁勞動的成績。……」</p>
<p>這雖然有些近於自我宣揚與矜誌，但她的　識是不錯的。當馬丁艾德禮（英國首相艾德總的兒子）在上海灘畔的海船上，伸出一隻擦地板以後的做髒的手，和中國記者握手時，說；「我的手太勝了！」這兩件事，顯然有交相輝映的越味二個是首相的兒子，一個是即將繼承王位的公主，他們都以勞動的髒手自豪，這較之一般男人以白凈的手指爲高貴，一般女人以塗紅指甲油爲美麗的情形比起來，逈然不同了。</p>
<p>無論機械發明到什麼程度，人們的勞働的手始終都是有甲的，胼手胝足，不只是我們祖先的事，也將是我們後代的事，「手工業」雖然落伍了，但勞働的手永久是有用的。假如你只愛你的一雙嬌嫩的手，給愛人撫摸，給貴賓握　而已，什麽應幹的事都「袖手旁觀」起來，那將來必弄到　論什麽　都「束手無策」甚至「束手待斃」爲止。</p>
<p>英國工黨執政以後，雖高貴如儲君伊麗沙白公主的手，也一難而爲以勞動自矜的有　有油（不是指甲油）的手了，這象徵了英國的新生，英國的進步。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>重振道德</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>何應欽將軍在紐約對聯合社記者發表渠所擬議之制止中國內戰計劃。主張重振道德，以道德的力量給予國家以新的準繩。被謂：澈底根絕中共之惟一方法，厥在由國府策動改革，爭取共軍控制區之民心。聯合社記者以何氏向爲職業軍人，今竟出此論調，殊屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>其實，無論國際間怎樣勾心鬥角，無論强權政治怎樣梟張全球，誰都知道戰爭的味兒不是好玩的，戰爭更不能解決任何一個紛爭的問題。第一次大戰之後，繼之有第二次大戰，方今和會尙在進行，而第三次大戰已有隱憂，這就說明了戰爭並不能帶來眞正的和平！</p>
<p>何應欽將軍主張重振道德以消弭內戰，衡之於國際戰爭亦同。道德二字之意義何氏雖未作說明，然我信必基於互諒，互重，互助之一種信念；是建設的，進化的一種社會力。惟有如此準繩，人心才能不墜，人慾亦不致於横流崩決。</p>
<p>在理性沉倫的今日，我們提起道德二字也許有入認爲迂腐之論。然如沒有道德的準繩，大家都爲私利打算，我們的社會怎有澄淸之日。今日我們國內到處有貪官，汚吏，奸商，盜匪，姦殺，詐騙等人事，不就說明了我們的社會道德已淪喪殆盡？</p>
<p>歷經八年的抗戰，我們物質的破毁，固然損失深重；但我們國民道德的敗壞，影響到我們的建國進程，也許比物質的損失更加重大！</p>
<p>所以重建道德的力量，實在是我們復興國族主要的因素，一個民族的盛衰，就要看他能否有應適於時代的一種社會道德。日本戰敗了，但日本人在被管制之下都能刻苦熬忍，努力復國。他們這一種「刻苦」「熬忍」的精神，就是他們目前的一種道德準繩了。</p>
<p>不過以道德振奮人心，維繫民信，這要在於一般先覺的份子篤行不茍，蔚然成風。故中國今日的官吏以及敎育文化界人士，如何整肅工作，努力自愛，更爲發輝道德之力的要着。</p>
<h3>觀球雜錄</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>星島和漢城會師於逸國，我們幾個人雖算不得球迷，但興高采烈的趕去，預備觀戰。預料觀衆一定擁擠，所以匆匆地吃了午飯就出發。却不料票子就發生了問題；沒有那麼股勁兒去「軋」，只得求之於黑市，「五千賣六千」，覺得多出千把塊不値什法，並非「忍痛」的掬出錢來換到了門票。（紙張是黄色的。及進得大門後，發現有的人持着白色紙張的票子，不知爲什麽同一時間的門票還要分色）。</p>
<p>擠進了園門，問題越來越大了：人！到處是人！看台上不必說，連屋頂上，樹上，甚至球塲內都有人。球員來了無法開球，出動憲兵義警還無法維持秩序，一位憲兵的頭並中了一流磚」而掛了彩。</p>
<p>好容易理出了個球塲，但開球後沒有幾分鐘，球失踪了。人團是擁來擠去，一看「苗頭」不對，連忙相偕退出逸園。W常常想入非非，他第一個發起議論來：</p>
<p>「奴性！憲兵義警勸吿不生效力；要是憲兵或義警態度欠溫和些，必致打起架來。刺刀前面誰敢撒野？奴性！一百個奴性！」</p>
<p>H是最愛面子的人，對於W的意見顯然不表贊同，於是反問W說：</p>
<p>「你不是中國人？這樣的就說中國人是奴性的？——不過，這樣太沒有面子了了：看球跑到塲內去看，放爆竹，　嚷，無秩序，呌外國朋友　了怪不好意思的。」等他一連串說話吿一段落時，我插嘴說：</p>
<p>「無限止出售門門票，至少是無預計的出售門票，怕也不大對吧？你們不要儘說奴性和面子。」</p>
<p>「那裏！」W盛氣凌人地說：「極可能是有計劃的搗蛋，有票也擠，無票也擠，還擠到塲中去讓賽不成球！」</p>
<p>M也開口了：</p>
<p>「你說搗蛋，證據何在？原因何在？」</p>
<p>「搗蛋就是搗蛋，還不是很明顯的事實嗎？難道你不在塲？你沒有看見？」</p>
<p>究竟是怎麽一回事呢？讓它作爲懸案吧！</p>
<h3>天使</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>甲男：尊夫人是怎麼樣一位人物？</p>
<p>乙男：啊，她是一位天使，眞是一位天使。</p>
<p>甲男：唔，你比我幸福得多了。我的太太至今還活着呢。</p>
<h3>聽交響樂演奏記</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>四月廿七日蘭心的市府音樂會，不到五點鐘，已經客滿了。有好些因沒有票退了出去，有少數人擠到後合去了。</p>
<p>開顯是貝多芬芬Coriolano序曲。一開始便是重音，和霎時的休止，這聲音好像在一閃一閃地，把全塲的聽衆都聽得緊張起來。多芬的作品，處處顯得偉大，有火一般地熱烈。</p>
<p>接着勒斯比基Resspighi的組曲：這是與前面的序曲是完全不同的。</p>
<p>第三個節目是莫札爾德交饗曲第卅九首，莫氏是古典派的代表者，現在一般新派的人都說他太陳舊了。但是莫民的作品，在你第一次聽的時候，決不覺得新　，而聽了數十遍也不致於說聽厭了，這便是莫氏的特點。</p>
<p>在休息之後是愛爾格Elgar悲歌，弦樂合奏的。愛氏是近代英國很著名的作曲家，但是這支曲調，却平凡得很。</p>
<p>最後兩支曲子都是格林哥爾Crainger的作品，先是一個由愛爾蘭調改編的，是用弦樂和兩個法國號角合奏的。這支曲子眞是非常好聽的，使人非常容易接受。末了一曲也是格氏作品——牧者之呼聲，短而暢快。在台下不斷掌聲裏，重奏了一次，有同樣的精彩。</p>
<p>全隊人員演奏得都不錯，成績以弦樂部份最好，吹樂器中有一兩個還是從前工部局的隊員，反而不怎麽　。但無論如何，這種成績是已經很了不得。希望下一次（五月十一日）的演奏，更要比這一次精彩。我們等待着指揮阿利國敎授的訓練，當然不會使我們失望的，他一定會使得我們覺得一次比一次滿童。</p>
<h3>嗎啡</h3>
<p>— 馬進</p>
<p>四月十二日，招待局蔡鍔輪自津抵滬，由數女客行囊中抄獲嗎啡八大包，計重七十七兩四錢，約値三億元之鉅。</p>
<p>這條新聞大大地震顫了我底靈魂，更使我想起當年敵人對華毒化政策的殘酷與徹底；勝利之來欲兩年，天津竟還是製毒販毒的總窟，夫復何言？</p>
<p>北方俗呼嗎啡爲白粉，凡敵騎竄擾過的地方，就有白粉，淪陷期間，冀晋一帶雖山村僻壤之區，茶烟小店之經營或有　如，面白粉生意必不能少、蓋一以需要切，二以牟利　也。是故大河廣漠之　，家不計貧富，人不分男女，即十餘　小兒女亦多有嗜毒成　者，其害之烈，其　之深，可知矣。</p>
<p>七七以前，天津日租界即爲毒品製銷的大本營，日鮮浪人主其事，戰時藉軍部勞力爲掩護，斯業益形猖獗，白粉的原料是　片，當民國三十年前後，晋察綏諸省曾受日僞密令廣植烟苗，未知勝利後絕跡否耶？</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>
<p>成都現有兩個話劇塲。沙利文劇塲正演姚克編的「楚　　」。中國藝術劇　則演「狂歡之夜」。另一說，中國勝利劇　即將以遊擊姿態，演出夏衍編的「芳草天涯』。</p>
<p>王西彥仍在福州編福州時報　　刋一文藝」，最近有　向滬地友人約稿，對於稿費一項，　特別聲明在前，　是一低得可憐」云。</p>
<p>成都文協於五四文藝節，已　　會員叙養，並改選理事。</p>
<h3>談隱逸</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>這是一則嘲笑和尙的故事：</p>
<p>「吳園次（綺）遊廣州，有僧大汕者，日伺候督撫將軍諸監司之門，一日向吳自述酬應雜遲，不堪苦擾。吳笑應之曰：　旣苦之，何不出家？」（王士禎一香祖筆記」）</p>
<p>和尙原有幾等：一等是臨陣脫逃的人生戰塲上的「逃兵」；一等是「和尙不娶妻，小和尙從何處來」？却又終於有人送到廟裏來的小和尙，自幼至長，不知「家」爲何物，更不知「出家」爲何事；又一等則是由居士而出世，貌似慣世嫉俗，其實却是「雅」的犧牲者；最後一等則是自命詩僧之流，六根淸凈，風姿傲然，而有時也深欲列名於候補官名單內，厠身於達官貴人的後門裏，「翩然一集雲中燕，飛來飛去宰相衙。」</p>
<p>楊誠齋詩云；「袈裟未著言多事，著了袈裟事更多」。我不知道那位大汕和尙應列入第幾等。——「何不出家」乎！「出」過一次的了。</p>
<p>眞正的隱者不如是。</p>
<p>朱晦庵說：「隱者都是帶性負氣之人為之，如陶　，欲有為而不得者也。」這話實在道盡了眞正的隱者的心事。帶性負氣的屈原，雖欲隱而耐不下心，終於沉入了汨羅江；欲隱的蔡邕在「我能族人」一語下立刻屈膝，隱不成了；陶淵明雖比較淡泊，可是也不免「刑天舞千戚」，而自誇「猛志固常在」的。有人說：</p>
<p>「陶潛之在晋末，是和孔融于漢末稽康于魏末略同，又是將近易代的時候。但他沒有什麼康慨激昂的表示，於是便博得田園詩人的名稱，但陶集里有述酒一篇，是說當時爲政治的。……由此可見陶潛總不能超脫塵世，而且，子朝政還是留心，也不能忘掉死，這是他詩文中時時提起的。」</p>
<p>正因爲這樣，陶潛雖做不成矯情者眼中的「雅人」，却還不失其溫厚的人性，——是一個平凡的人。眞正的隱者就應該是這樣：「宜于朝則朝，宜于野則野。」旣不虛飾，自無矯情，不能兼善天下，自無妨獨善其身。</p>
<p>焦循說得好：</p>
<p>「人不可隱，不能隱，亦無所謂隱，有周公孔子之學而不仕，乃可以隱稱：然有周公孔子之學，則必不隱，許由，巢父，沮溺之流，自負其孤子之性，自知不能益人家國，托迹于山溪林莽以藏其抽，故吟詠風月則有餘，立異矯世，苦節獨立則有餘，出而操天下之柄則不足。……是故耕而食，鑿而飲，分也。……宜子朝則朝，宜于野則野，聖人之藏，所以待用也。無可用之具而自託于隱，悖也。」</p>
<p>這話，對於今之大汕和尙之流，應該是一味上好的淸醒劑吧。</p>
<h3>書荒</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>報載：山西書荒嚴重，並謂敵僞時期的課本尙在　論。勝利已近二年，這種情形似乎應予終止。</p>
<p>不要說印刷條件落在人後的山西，就拿上海來說，目前小學敎科書印刷方面的缺點已很多：錯字，缺筆，糢糊，不一而足。旣有害於小學生的目力，復增多小學生寫錯字的機會。在印刷條件相當優越的上海，這些缺點本不應有，不知爲了什麼還讓這些缺點保存下去？難道還沒到一改除缺點的時機嗎？</p>
<p>誰也不會否認　本敎育的重要，但與基本敎育直接發生關係的工具（最起碼的工具）尙弄不好，遑論其他？</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「老祝是賣足力氣了！」張昌點頭播腦地說：「今兒他中飯也沒有回來吃，一定又在那裏釘着那個什麽交通處長想辦法！」</p>
<p>屋子裏的人不很樂觀地面面相覷着。</p>
<p>老祝已經認眞地奔走了快一個月了！——就爲要借一輛或二輛卡車。可是留在這危城裏的人已經一天一天的少了，而愈是留着後走的人的心便愈狠，簡直可以說不論黨政軍商學工，祗　手裏有車子的都成了叱咤風雲，目空一切的大人物，都成了現實主義的最忠實信徒。什麽國家，什麽親戚，什麼朋友，誰都不放在心上。大家的心目中，祗有自己，祗有貨，祗有鈔票。——一張張立刻可以化的鈔票。支票也不成！</p>
<p>敵人快打過來了，誰去抵擋？怎樣抵擋。再追過來我們怎麼辦？逃西藏？逃　馬拉亞山？……自始至終，這城裏就沒有人考慮過。好像抗戰根本是別人的事，他們祗管一件事——逃難！</p>
<p>危城！那裏是危城啊？應該說「愚人之城」才是名符其實！</p>
<p>愚人的一羣議論了半天車子的問題，忽然又有人提到了中孚公司的總經理徐紹明和他那位威名素著的唱大鼓出身的山東太太。</p>
<p>「那個女人眞　！」張昌天眞地說：「憑她那樣潑辣凶悍的性格，倒有很好的音樂天才。昨兒我和老陳他們走過徐家門口，聽裏面有人彈吉他，彈得挺好的。後來在東江碰到胡太太，說她也會拉小提琴，可惜……」</p>
<p>「可惜嫁了徐結明，不然你跟妙做朋友。是不是？」有人立刻插嘴出來打趣。</p>
<p>「那小張就倒霉了！」盧前也不禁破顏一笑。「耳朶大概一個禮拜至少得撕破兩次，口琴也吹不成了！」</p>
<p>張昌把眼睛婁一霎，做了個鬼臉。</p>
<p>「我才不愛她咧！」頓了一頓，他又改換了一種口氣說：「跟胡太太比，那她就差得太遠了！胡太太不但長得好看，性格文靜，而且可以說是一個沒有變質的標準的藝人！」（五八）</p>

<h3>Significance of the Executive Yuan Reorganization is to Trial the Responsibility System, Zhang Qun's Address at the Political Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, stated at the first Political Affairs Meeting on the morning of the 29th that the significance of this reorganization of the Executive Yuan is to trial the Executive Yuan's responsibility system, and that the Executive Yuan should be collectively responsible hereafter. The collective resignation of all the incumbent ministers and heads of departments of the Executive Yuan this time, plus the new appointments, is an example of expressing this spirit. The discussion of the Executive Yuan's Rules of Procedure then began. Regarding Article 6, which concerns matters that should be decided by the Executive Yuan's meeting, various committee members spoke one after another. As a result, the majority believed that the rules were established based on Article 26 of the National Government Organization Law and did not need to be amended; however, an explanation was added to the resolution, which was passed without objection. Then the discussion of various proposals continued. After the discussion, Zhang Qun gave another brief speech, the main points of which are as follows: First, it is hoped that the various ministries and commissions will improve administrative efficiency, and it is announced that the time for receiving official business will be from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM for meeting with senior officials within the Executive Yuan, from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM for various ministries and commissions to discuss official business, and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM for various provinces and cities to discuss official business, excluding meeting times. The remaining time will be spent reading official documents and not receiving guests in order to save time and improve efficiency. Second, in the future, review meetings will be held with various ministries and commissions at another fixed time each week to exchange opinions in the form of a meeting report. Third, in the future, unimportant proposals do not need to be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion, and the Executive Yuan meeting should focus on the decision of important policies. Fourth, in the future, national budget proposals should all be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion so that everyone can understand them and be jointly responsible; although the President of the Executive Yuan has the power to handle the payment of funds for the promulgation of emergency orders, special attention should be paid to them, and it is best to complete the legal bill first.</p>

<h3>Object of National Government Chairman's Responsibility, Constitutional Government Conference Enthusiastically Discusses, Elects Five Committee Members to Participate in Comfort Mission</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The Standing Committee of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association held its first meeting at 3:00 PM on the 29th to discuss the key case submitted by the Research Committee that the Chairman of the National Government should be responsible to the National Assembly. Chairman Sun Ke, more than 30 committee members attended. In addition to reporting matters, the following cases were discussed and passed: (1) Work plans of the Research, Investigation, and Propaganda Committees, with matters requiring processing by the Standing Committee. (2) The case that the Chairman of the National Government should be responsible to the National Assembly for the Constitution. The discussion lasted a long time, and the committee members expressed their opinions very enthusiastically. Ren Zhuoxuan and Sun Mujia repeatedly spoke, emphasizing that although the current government is not elected, it is a government preparing to implement the constitution, so the Chairman of the National Government should be responsible to the National Assembly. However, Sun Ke explained that the National Assembly for the Constitution seems to be limited by time, because in fact, the elected president is produced after the National Assembly for the Constitution. If it is only limited to the National Assembly for the Constitution, then the president's responsibility during this transition period will have no object. Therefore, the two words "for the Constitution" should be deleted. It was then passed and submitted to the joint meeting for decision before advising the government. Following the passage of (3) Rotating committee members to go to various places to carry out propaganda, dispatched in batches from May 15, submitted to the joint meeting for decision. (4) Decided to participate in the military comfort mission organized by the Executive Yuan. (5) Elected five committee members to participate in the Central Military Comfort Mission. (6) Organized an investigation team to go to Taiwan and the Northeast provinces and cities for investigation. (7) Reprinted a single copy of the constitution and established a periodic publication to elaborate on the constitution and other cases. In addition, there were five temporary proposals, the main ones being "Vocational representatives should use the number of people in each place as a ratio to facilitate the election of vocational groups", and to send them to the Legislative Yuan for processing as soon as possible, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Deng Xihou Arrives in Beijing to Visit the Chairman and Report on Sichuan Politics</h3>

The reporter visited him at 5:00 PM and he gave the following statement: "I left Nanjing two years before the Republic of China and it has been 38 years since then. Now I am summoned to Beijing, and the separation has been reunited. The mountains and rivers are still the same, and everything is full of new atmosphere, and I feel very happy in my heart. The Sichuan and Kang areas are currently very stable, and all important policies are being implemented smoothly. Since President Zhang went to Chengdu last time and convened a security meeting to launch a total suppression of bandits, the giant bandits Shuai Pengzhang and Yin Luozi, who have plagued southern Sichuan for many years, have been killed one after another. The defense of northeastern Sichuan is also very solid. The economic construction of Sichuan has long been the focus of attention of the people of the country. Since the central government has designated Sichuan as an experimental province, the Sichuan Provincial Five-Year Construction Plan has also been approved and is now being actively promoted, such as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Dujiangyan Hydropower Project, and we are working hard to see its early completion. The only problem is that Sichuan's financial resources are limited. In order to achieve complete completion, we must rely on collective wisdom and efforts. In the future, we will ask the central government for instructions and step up the handling. During the War of Resistance, many people from various provinces came to Sichuan and made many contributions to Sichuan's economic and cultural undertakings. I hope that they will be supported and guided at any time in the future so that they can be successful!" Deng is scheduled to meet with Minister Bai Chongxi at 6:00 PM tonight and visit President Zhang Qun at 9:00 PM to discuss various issues related to Sichuan's politics, and will also visit Chairman Chiang to report on the military and political situation in Sichuan in the coming days.</p>

(2) Subsidies for public utilities in Beijing and Shanghai will still follow the subsidy method of March and April, with an appropriate increase in the amount. (3) No results were obtained from the discussion of the rice and grain issue. Regarding the student public rice issue, the municipal government and school authorities will discuss and find appropriate solutions to ensure adequate supply.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] It is learned that in addition to deciding on the distribution of public rice for students, the Price Committee has also decided that newspapers can enjoy the benefit of distribution. That is, all organizations with a large number of employees can follow suit. The reason is to avoid direct purchases from the market and stimulate prices. It is also learned that the purchase of military rice can be done in cities in the future. Therefore, it is observed that rice prices can be stabilized after this measure. It is also learned that the standard for increasing subsidies for public utilities in Shanghai is to appropriately increase coal, transportation, and other industries by 10%. Beijing remains the same.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The Price Committee is scheduled to hold another meeting at 10 AM on the 30th to discuss the rice and grain issue. Wu Guozhen and others will return to Shanghai after the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 29th] The Suzhou rice market is even more chaotic today. Although the black market has risen to 220,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), some rice shops are still refusing to sell retail. At around 8 AM, Xie Yuan Rice Shop on Daoqian Street was surrounded and questioned by over a hundred people for insisting on refusing to sell rice. Fortunately, the local police station intervened appropriately, preventing a disturbance.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Discusses Principles of Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Chen Lifu, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, told reporters on the 29th that the principles for stabilizing prices are approximately the following two points: (1) Increase production to equalize supply, and the government should provide low-interest loans, ensuring that the recipients are producers, rather than allowing the loans to flow into hoarding raw materials, creating the opposite result. (2) Avoid all actions that stimulate prices. For example, the recent issuance of 10,000-yuan banknotes will not actually affect prices, but merchants are using this as an excuse to stir up trouble. Therefore, I believe it is best to avoid all facts that could stimulate price increases.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Meets on May 5th Discussing Percentage of Reparations US Demands that All Countries State Their Opinions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] It was learned here today that the Far Eastern Commission will hold a meeting on May 5th, attempting to reach an agreement on the percentage of Japanese reparations. According to authoritative sources, the United States has been striving in the past few weeks to have the representatives of the eleven countries on the committee state the percentage of reparations their country hopes for, and express their opinions on the percentage that other countries should receive. Due to General MacArthur's repeated urging, the United States has made a final decision on the reparations issue and has now asked all countries to state their opinions in order to break the current deadlock. Diplomatic observers are not very optimistic about the outcome of future meetings. They privately say that if they do not compromise on the reparations demands of the United States, China, and other countries, a final agreement cannot be reached. Diplomats said that the United States is now willing to allow each country to retain all Japanese assets within its borders, but these assets must be deducted from their final demands. If the meeting starting on May 5th still results in a deadlock, the United States can issue interim instructions to General MacArthur, ordering him to distribute additional preliminary reparations to the countries demanding reparations, just as it recently ordered General MacArthur to distribute 30% of existing assets to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The Reparations Subcommittee of the Far Eastern Commission discussed procedural issues today. A spokesman for the committee said that the reparations issue was not involved. The next meeting is scheduled for next week.</p>

<h3>Peace Conference with Japan May be Convened Next Spring</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 29th] Related sources report: The peace conference with Japan is expected to be convened next spring. The London Four Foreign Ministers Conference in November this year will discuss the issue of convening the peace conference.

The investigation period has been extended to the end of August.</p>
<h3>Philippines Opposes Overseas Chinese Returning to the Philippines Immigration Bureau Insists Most Strongly</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 29th] According to authoritative sources today, the reason why 7,600 Chinese people who lived in the Philippines before their jobs are being prevented from re-entering the islands is due to the opposition of the Philippine government. (Note: These Chinese people were transported back to China from the Philippines by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in 1945 as displaced persons.) It is said that the Director of the Immigration Bureau, Fabre, is the main figure opposing the return of Chinese people to the Philippines. He believes that the large number of Chinese coming to the Philippines is not in line with the current immigration policy and will increase economic difficulties. He also listed various reasons such as the severity of housing and food problems, the surge in living expenses, and the increase in unemployment.</p>
<h3>Advisor to Chinese Delegation to Far Eastern Commission Yang Yunzhu to Depart for the United States Today Conversed Freely with Reporters Yesterday About Various Matters Concerning Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yang Yunzhu, Minister-level Advisor to the Chinese Delegation to the Far Eastern Commission, arrived in Shanghai on the 26th and was suddenly summoned back to Nanjing by the Chairman for instructions. Mr. Yang returned to Shanghai the night before last and is scheduled to depart for the United States today on the General Gordon. Before his departure, he met with reporters and said that he will be in the United States for about a year. When passing through Japan, he will consult with the Chinese delegation to Japan to collect the necessary information for use during the Far Eastern Commission's meetings. The focus of China's handling of the Japanese issue is in Tokyo and Washington, D.C., and he will work to strengthen the close ties between the two places.</p>
<p>Japanese Reparations Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese reparations issue, Mr. Yang believes that China currently has two important tasks: one is the utilization of the first batch of relocated materials. This batch of materials is only 480,000 tons, but it already requires 400 billion national currency in transportation costs, plus tens of millions of US dollars to purchase parts. It is not easy to obtain, so we should think about how to maximize its use. The second is to solve the problem of Japan's total reparations, which should be studied first and a detailed plan should be established. At the London Foreign Ministers Conference in the 34th year of the Republic (1945), Foreign Minister Wang Jingwei proposed two principles: (1) China should obtain the largest percentage, and (2) China should have priority in compensation. At that time, the United Kingdom and the United States warmly supported it, and France and the Soviet Union had no different opinions. Therefore, China is in an advantageous position when implementing the total reparations plan. As for the recent US proposal that China receive 45% of the temporary reparations, Mr. Yang said that the official has not yet received a formal report, and this matter may need to be handled after Secretary of State Marshall returns to the United States. Before the meeting in Moscow, China originally hoped that the United States and the Soviet Union would compromise so that the European reparations issue could be completed smoothly, as a basis for the Japanese reparations method. Now things have gone awry, and judging from the current situation, the complete resolution of the Japanese reparations issue may take two years.</p>
<p>Production Level Issue</p>
<p>When discussing the issue of determining Japan's production level, Mr. Yang pointed out that there are two types of production levels: one is the "peacetime economic level," which is the maximum limit for Japan's future recovery. The Allied Council for Japan has decided to adopt the average figures from 1931 to 1934. The second is the "industrial production level," which refers to the figure guaranteed to be maintained during the implementation of reparations, that is, Japan's existing maximum production capacity. This has not yet been decided, and everything is open for discussion.</p>
<p>Peace Treaty Signing Issue</p>
<p>As for the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, someone in General MacArthur's headquarters has suggested that China should actively prepare now, strive for initiative, and prepare a draft treaty as early as possible. When the peace treaty can be signed depends largely on the shift in the European situation. Whether the procedure for concluding the peace treaty is to first resolve the issues of demilitarization and reparations before signing it has not been decided. All of these are the main topics for future discussions by the Far Eastern Commission.</p>

<h3>Fisheries Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities Demand Prevention of Japanese Fishing Boats from Intruding Urge the Navy to Send Ships to Patrol the Coast</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 29th] Fifteen fisheries representatives from Zhejiang, Fujian, Taiwan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Liaoning, Guangdong, and Beijing-Shanghai provinces and cities appealed today to the Navy to send ships to patrol the coast to prevent Japanese fishing boats from intruding into Chinese waters, and requested the removal of floating mines, the suppression of pirates, and the organization of patrol teams to protect fishing boats.

<h3>United States Donates Large Number of Warships Helping to Build Our Navy Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui Talks to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, told reporters on the morning of the 29th that the United States' donation of 271 warships to us is sufficient to promote the success of the construction of our new navy. The naval authorities have not yet received formal notification from the US regarding this matter, but they believe that it will soon be learned through diplomatic channels. The United States' donation of warships to China was decided last year and is a confirmed case. Our entire past training plan was formulated in preparation for receiving the ships. When the first batch of US warships can arrive is still unknown until formal notification is received. In terms of preparation work, the main one is naval training. Currently, we have about 600 naval personnel in the United Kingdom, and there are also a considerable number in the United States. The most important naval school in China is the Qingdao Training Corps. The equipment there is excellent. The first batch of ship receiving personnel has graduated from training, and training will continue in the future. The greatest need in China at present is for mid- and lower-level officers, especially junior officers and non-commissioned officers. After the US warships arrive in China, some of the old ships will be scrapped so that the original personnel can be transferred to serve on the new ships. In addition, the authorities are also paying special attention to naval treatment and welfare. Equally important as training is port management. The authorities are actively carrying this out. The Qingdao harbor has good construction. The Zuoying naval defense remains to be completed. The Hainan Island base is also being planned. Gui concluded by saying: Although the construction of the navy is not without difficulties, the future is very promising. When asked about the recent situation of the Xisha Islands, Gui replied that he had recently sent people to the islands and brought many mobile houses to strengthen the arrangements.</p>

As for the losses of the newspapers, Gao Tiejun, a provincial senator from Wuhu, is responsible for requesting compensation from the authorities. The three newspapers were satisfied and resumed publication on the 25th.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>

<h3>Editorial The Path to World Peace</h3>
<p>——After Reading Secretary of State Marshall's Speech——</p>
<p>After returning to the United States from Moscow, Secretary of State Marshall delivered a broadcast speech to the people of the country on the 28th, reporting on the proceedings of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, so that every American could gain a correct understanding. After the close of the Moscow Conference, American political and diplomatic figures, relying on the news reported by news agencies and newspapers, were unwilling to comment on the success or failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference until Secretary of State Marshall returned home to report. In fact, we have the same feeling. Now, after listening to Secretary of State Marshall's long speech, we can better understand the crux of the failure of the Moscow Conference.</p>
<p>We summarize Secretary of State Marshall's speech, and its main points are as follows: (1) The failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was due to the Soviet Union's use of the Foreign Ministers Conference to incite popular enthusiasm and prejudice, rather than appealing to reason and understanding. (2) The so-called German question can be analyzed into the following five issues: (1) the scope of authority of the German central government; (2) the nature of the German economic system and its relationship with European countries; (3) the nature and scope of German reparations; (4) the German border issue; (5) the procedure for drafting the German peace treaty and the manner of its approval. (3) The reason why the United States cannot compromise on issues of great importance is because it does not want to "establish an agreement for the sake of an agreement." (4) On April 15, Marshal Stalin told him that the main issues discussed at the Moscow Conference, such as disarmament, political organization, reparations, and economic unification, could all be compromised; but at this time, there was still a need for patience and to avoid pessimism. (5) Marshal Marshall sincerely hopes that the views expressed by Stalin are correct, and that the Soviet representatives will fully demonstrate their spirit of cooperation when attending the next international conference.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that although Marshal Marshall also acknowledged the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the torch of hope is still burning in his heart. On the one hand, he hopes that the Soviet Union can fully demonstrate its spirit of cooperation at the next international conference, so that the main issues on which countries have different opinions can be compromised; on the other hand, he asks the American people to take united action to fulfill the tasks that the United States bears to the world. If both the United States and the Soviet Union can realize Secretary of State Marshall's ideals, it will not be difficult to dispel the clouds and mists shrouding the skies of the two countries and reveal the sunlight of peace and democracy. Therefore, Marshal Marshall's speech not only explained the current world situation but also pointed out a path to world peace. No matter from which angle we observe the general trend of the world, we attach great importance to and should study Marshal Marshall's wise and insightful instructions.</p>
<p>In today's world, it can be said that there is no one who does not seek peace! No one who does not desire peace! It's just that the methods and paths to be taken to create world peace vary. For example, between the United States and the Soviet Union, who does not want peace! But the paths taken by the two countries are running in opposite directions. The Soviet Union seeks to expand its so-called "security zone" and wants to erect an "iron curtain" around it, creating another world; while the United States wants to maintain the secret of atomic energy and the military bases scattered throughout the world, and wants to use gold and money as the backing of its diplomacy to create a common front to prevent the expansion of totalitarian forces. Therefore, the opinions of both sides on any issue always run in opposite directions. Leaving this aside, even within the United States itself, who does not long for peace to be realized as soon as possible; but opinions on how to win peace are not entirely the same, and there are considerable distances between them. For example, President Truman said in a speech to the Democratic National Convention on April 5: "The United States has an unshirkable responsibility to create world peace; therefore, it should bear the responsibility of assisting the freedom of people of all countries when they are in danger. In order to fulfill this responsibility, the United States must maintain sufficient military strength to make all countries in the world believe that the United States is determined to act in accordance with its responsibilities." President Truman's views can be regarded as the foundation of American policy; and all recent American activities in the international arena are based on this as a guideline. The second is Wallace, who has been the most vocal opponent of American policy, and has recently traveled to European countries, giving speeches everywhere. Although he also spoke of the urgency of the American people's desire for peace, he firmly opposes the Truman Doctrine, and even claims that President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey plan is enough to lead to the division of the world and the outbreak of World War III. He advocates understanding with the Soviet Union and requests the government to lend money to the Soviet Union to help it build a socialist country. In addition, there is also a Republican presidential candidate, Stetson, who, after touring sixteen European countries, returned home and said: "If the United States can remain strong and adopt policies that are conducive to world powers, then world peace can be maintained for at least thirty years." This is Stetson's conclusion after inspecting the European continent. These three opinions can represent the views of three aspects of the United States, but which path will the United States ultimately take to create world peace?</p>
<p>After listening to Secretary of State Marshall's broadcast speech, we can analyze and derive the following new trends in the European policy that the United States will adopt in the future. (1) The United States will actively assist Greece and Turkey; (2) Fully utilize the resources of the Ruhr and Silesia regions to stabilize the European economy, so that the European continent will also become an economic unit; (3) Continue to control Germany to make it a peaceful and democratic country; (4) Unify western Germany. After the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones, they will be politically merged, and France is welcome to participate; (5) Strive for French support. The de Gaulle faction has launched the French People's Union movement in France, which is obviously encouraged by this American policy.</p>
<p>Can the United States adopt this policy to promote peace in Europe? No one can give a definite answer, and even President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall of the United States are not sure. However, we believe that the people of all countries in the world are so eager for peace that the wishes of all mankind will eventually be realized one day. Marshal Marshall asked the American people to understand the views of other countries so that these complex and intricate problems can be solved concretely and definitively, which is the only path for the United States to move towards world peace. Conversely, we have no other excessive demands on the Soviet Union, but we hope that it can also be like the United States, appealing to conscience and reason on all international issues, so that prejudice and fanaticism cannot arise, and any difficult problems will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>In short, we expect that both the United States and the Soviet Union can take the path to world peace. The Director of the Fisheries Administration Announces Guarantee Measures</p>

<h3>Marshall Delivers Broadcast Elaborating U.S. Position Failure of Foreign Ministers' Conference Attributed to the Soviet Union Stalin Reportedly Told Marshall That Compromise Was Possible</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 28th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall recently condemned the Soviet Union for causing the Moscow Conference to fail, but also revealed that Stalin believed that compromise was possible on important issues concerning Germany. In his broadcast speech to the nation reporting on the proceedings of the Moscow Conference, Marshall said: On April 15, I went to the Kremlin for talks with Stalin, and Stalin frankly believed that this conference could not achieve "major achievements." The Soviet delegation not only failed to reach an agreement at the conference but also used it as a forum to promote prejudices and emotional impulses instead of seeking reason and understanding. The divide between the Allies is now clearly in sight. The United States is "agreeing for the sake of agreement," so it will not compromise on major principles.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 21st Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall broadcasted to the nation today, reporting on the course of the 革期科 conference, lasting half an hour. It is said that although the four foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on major issues, their achievements in promoting the final settlement in the future may be greater than those actually felt. Various major disagreements were fully exposed for the first time and are now clearly understood. Therefore, when negotiations are reopened in the future, there may be a correct understanding of the solution. The failure of the Moscow Conference to reach an agreement, in our view, is due to the Soviet Union's insistence on its various proposals. According to this proposal, Germany should establish a centralized government and obtain absolute control over the entire country, but because it is small in land and densely populated, and must use a large part of its production to compensate the Soviet Union, it will inevitably be economically unsustainable. The Soviet delegation also made the same request to Austria in another way. From the perspective of the American delegation, this attempt not only made the United States endlessly lose money, but also promoted the deterioration of German and European life, allowing dictatorship and struggle to take advantage of the situation. Moscow promotes emotionalism and erases reason and understanding. The accusations and interpretations of the Soviet representatives regarding the Potsdam and other agreements are very different from the facts known to the public or the actual knowledge of the American delegation. We cannot compromise on major principles and must sincerely understand where we disagree with each other. Marshall reported on the content of his meeting with Stalin, saying: Stalin once said that the Moscow Conference was merely a "reconnaissance unit's forward contact" for resolving the European peace treaty. Marshall also said that in the past, disputes over other issues would usually lead everyone to exhaustion, and then they would recognize the necessity of compromise. This conference has hardly any possibility of major achievements. Stalin believes that major issues, such as the disarmament of Germany, the German political organization, compensation, and economic unification, are all possible to compromise, so there is a need for patience and no need to be pessimistic. I sincerely hope that Stalin's views are correct, which implies that the Soviet delegation will show greater cooperation in future conferences. But we cannot ignore the time factor. The revival of Europe is far behind schedule. The forces of division are becoming increasingly apparent. When the doctors are making a clinical diagnosis, the patient's condition is getting worse. Therefore, I believe that certain actions cannot wait until after exhaustion to compromise. New problems are emerging, and any action to address these urgent problems must be taken immediately. Marshall concluded: "The current world situation and the position of the United States make the American people responsible for unified action." Marshall praised Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg and Democratic former Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wang Xixi Connally for jointly leading the passage of the Aid to Turkey Act, believing that Washington's goals were consistent, and that his negotiations in Moscow were very rewarding.</p>
<h3>After the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference U.S. Policy Becomes More Determined It Can Gain the Support of Non-Communist Countries in Europe</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Moscow, 28th Dispatch] Since the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, the United States' European policy has been clearly defined as unprecedented. The American delegation hopes that this policy can gain the support of all non-communist nations in Europe. The main points are as follows: (1) President Truman announced aid to Greece and Turkey. The Soviet side denounced it as American imperialism. Diplomats from the United States, Britain, France, and some small countries outside Moscow said that this move shows the seriousness of the United States' intentions toward communism and the willingness of the United States to act on its words. (2) The international right to utilize the resources of the Ruhr and Silesia areas is recognized by the United States as a basic need of the European economy. Secretary of State Marshall has repeatedly advocated that a European Economic Committee be entrusted with the task of unifying European economic work. (3) Marshall's statement on the Four-Power Treaty. Although the tone of the draft was intended to be conciliatory to avoid offending Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Marshall was no different than saying that regardless of whether there is a Four-Power Treaty, the United States intends to control Germany for many years. (4) Definition of democracy. In discussing the German political issue, Marshall stated that the United States supports democracy and individual freedom. Most of his advisors believe that this is one of the central issues of the U.S.-Soviet conflict. (5) The United States has repeatedly tried to win France's support and has been quite successful. The United States wants to make France clearly join the Western bloc in the conflict with the Soviet Union. This desire can be seen in the U.S. attitude towards the Saar, German coal mines, and other issues. (6) The entire policy towards Germany has evolved from demilitarization to focusing on rebuilding a peaceful Germany without demanding reparations. The United States insists that Germany must be self-sufficient and manufacture goods for the needs of all of Europe. The above are the main points of the newly developed American policy. It remains to be seen whether it will be welcomed by Germany's small neighbors. The development of American policy involves many difficulties and disputes, and there are many fierce debates within the American delegation. The most famous are the conflict between Dulles and his "Pan-European" line and Clay and his "Germany first" line. Due to the weakness of Britain and France, which cannot maintain their leading positions in Europe, European power politics has been reduced to a matter of U.S.-Soviet relations. The U.S. relationship has changed from "good neighbor" to "strong neighbor." The U.S. attitude has reached such a degree that the American people need friendship and cooperation, but they feel that they cannot obtain it without confronting force with force. Therefore, even the wording of the Austrian peace treaty is disputed, because all parties do not trust that the other party has the sincerity to fulfill its obligations.</p>
<h3>Stetson's Remarks That the U.S. Should Remain Strong</h3>
<p>[French News Agency New York, 28th Dispatch] American Republican presidential candidate Stetson recently returned here after inspecting sixteen European countries and gave a speech to the press, saying: If the United States can remain strong and adopt humanitarian policies that benefit all countries, then peace can be maintained for at least thirty years. However, the United States must avoid all government policies of exploiting important industries. If production can be increased, the standard of living can be raised. This can only be achieved by private enterprise, not by the government. As for his meeting with Marshal Stalin, Stetson refused to express any opinions, only saying that he had recorded the conversation during the talk and plans to publish it simultaneously in both English and Russian.</p>
<h3>Pravda Commentary</h3>
<p>Said that the Foreign Ministers' Conference Achieved Much</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 29th Broadcast: The Soviet "Pravda" wrote an article claiming that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference had achieved much and sternly refuted foreign newspapers' claims that the conference had failed. The editorial said that the conference reached many important agreements and clarified the true positions of the countries on the German issue, which was a success. The Moscow Conference can be said to have laid the foundation for resolving the German issue.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Broadcast Speech Most Members Praised It</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th Dispatch] Democratic leader Barkley praised Marshall's report today as "the most candid and meaningful summary of the Moscow Conference that he has discovered." This can be seen as the basic tone of the initial response of Congress to his report. Barkley also said: "In my opinion, Marshall has defended the position of the United States with rare ability and composure." Other Democratic and Republican senators and representatives unanimously responded to Barkley's statement and agreed that Marshall made a meaningful and detailed report on the Moscow Four-Power Conference. However, Senator Pepper, who had recently criticized the U.S. administration's aid to Turkey plan, said: "Marshall's report has asked clearly that if we want to make progress in resolving the differences that exist between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, then we should both engage in resolving this issue in a spirit of compromise. We cannot solve it piecemeal."</p>
<h3>Clearing Lend-Lease Debts U.S. and Soviet Union to Negotiate Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 28th Dispatch] Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Novikov has informed the State Department that he is prepared to begin negotiations with the United States to resolve lend-lease debts. The State Department has recommended that negotiations begin on May 1 and are expected to last for several weeks.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton Directly Accuses Soviet Politics The Situation in Korea Is Exactly the Same as in Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 28th Dispatch] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said today: If Greece and Turkey are overthrown, then Iran and other Arab countries cannot avoid the same situation, followed by Afghanistan, India, and China. In that case, 140 million American people will confront 2 billion people incited by "ideas aimed at eliminating us." Eaton frankly stated that the plan to aid Greece and Turkey is to prevent communism from spreading from its source - the Soviet Union - to all parts.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 28th Dispatch] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said today in the House Judiciary Committee that the situation we are facing in Korea is exactly the same as in Greece and Turkey. The country is not only divided into two parts by the U.S. and the Soviet Union but also has communist philosophy penetrating the American zone. I sincerely do not know how to avoid serious conflict with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Wallace Receives Reporters</h3>
<p>Explaining Opinions on Domestic and Foreign Policies</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th Dispatch] Wallace has left an open door for the organization of a "Party of Peace" in order to nominate him as a candidate in the 1948 presidential election. In his first formal press conference since returning from Europe, Wallace defended his right to express his views in opposition to Truman's foreign policy while the United States was not at war abroad. He said that the way to maintain world peace is to lend foreign countries plows and tractors rather than munitions. In the hour-long press conference, Wallace touched on a wide range of domestic and foreign issues, and his opinions were roughly as follows: (1) The United States will have a commercial recession in 1948, "but not a serious one." The United States will not encounter a serious economic recession until its funds really begin to pile up like mountains and foreign countries run out of their dollars. (2) The Soviet Union fears that the United States will have a major economic setback, which may be the reason why the Soviet Union refused to participate in the World Bank and other international economic activities. (3) It is easier for the United States to allocate large sums of money to purchase munitions for export abroad than to cultivate farmland and other projects at home. Wallace said that he does not intend to travel abroad again, but he has been invited to the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Chile, and Argentina. He also said that no one had invited him to visit the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Siam to Request Land Concession from Vietnam Along the Border</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 28th] The French-Siamese Dispute Mediation Committee is about to meet. It is reported that Siam plans to request the concession of some land along the Vietnamese border. The committee was established in accordance with the Franco-Siamese Agreement of November 1948 and includes representatives from France, Siam, and neutral countries, specifically to discuss the existing territorial issues between Siam and Vietnam. Siam has already returned some land in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia that it occupied during the war with the help of Japan. Therefore, the French delegation will no longer make any demands. The Siamese delegation, however, requests to obtain some land near the mouth of the Mekong River on the border of Laos. The committee will also discuss the issue of damage to French public and private property by Siam and its compensation. A report should be submitted within six months of the meeting.</p>
<h3>White Rice Retains Vitamins Through New Method</h3>
<p>American Scientists Invent New Method</p>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, 28th] According to reliable sources in the local business community, several American scientists have invented a method to increase the amount of vitamins in rice, even after it has been milled white, while still maintaining its original texture.</p>
<h3>Conservative Forces Strong in Japanese Parliament; Socialist Party Striving for Compromise; Movements of Neutral Factions Attract Great Attention</h3>
<p>[Asia East Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The executive committee of the Japanese Socialist Party in Tokyo convened a meeting on the 28th to discuss the fundamental policy and attitude towards the political situation. After further discussion at the central standing committee meeting on May 3rd and the central executive committee meeting on May 10th, it will be announced all at once. It is reported that leading figures of the party, such as Katayama and Nishio, as well as most members of the party, support the following opinions: (1) The attitude of opposition to the Liberal Party adopted by party members before the election should be abandoned, and the responsibility for the next cabinet should be assumed; (2) The next cabinet should exclude the Communist Party and form a coalition cabinet of the Socialist, Liberal, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties; (3) Katayama should be the prime minister; (4) Regarding policy and cabinet member issues, the Socialist Party should make the maximum possible concessions and not adopt an attitude that would lead to the failure to form a cabinet or return to being an opposition party; Persuade left-wing members of the party to cooperate in helping Katayama form a cabinet.</p>
<p>[Asia East Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno met with Prime Minister Yoshida on the 28th. It is reported that Ohno's attitude was very firm. He believes that the Liberal Party is not much different from the Socialist Party in this general election. If it cooperates with the Democratic Party, conservative forces can still hold more than half of the seats in the parliament, so it should not easily entrust the government to the Socialist Party. Ohno also believes that about ten of the elected candidates who are independent or belong to small parties will join the Liberal Party soon, so it can still surpass the Socialist Party and become the largest party. If Ohno is right, the movements of the elected candidates who are independent or belong to small parties are worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Fourth General Election to be Held Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] Japan is holding four elections in April. Tomorrow is the last of these elections. Voters will vote to elect approximately 156,000 local councilors, including the councilors of the 46 counties, the 204 prefectures, and the villages and towns. Observers predict that the lower-level administrative structure will be completely changed because "undesirable elements" have been purged and are no longer allowed to hold public office.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminals Fantasize, Claim China Initiated the War</h3>
<p>Defendant Hatano Unwilling to Speak</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 29th] At their defense today, defendants Hideki Tojo and 24 others at the International Tribunal claimed that the threat of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's acts of aggression against Japanese residents in China prompted the Japanese army to station troops in China, leading to the "China Incident." The court immediately prohibited the defense. Presiding Judge Webb stated, "If the Chinese Communists or other Chinese people did indeed attack Japanese residents, it was because they anticipated the actions of the Japanese army."</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The Far East International Military Tribunal opened today. A witness for the defense, Hatano, was called to testify about the activities of the Chinese Communist Party, but the witness refused to speak. He was sent home without success. The defendants all claim that Hatano is an important witness in the "China Incident," but he has repeatedly declined to testify. This morning, he was subpoenaed and brought to court by American military police, but he still pretended to be mute.</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Returns to London; Emphasizes Patience in Building Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 29th (Broadcast): Bevin returned here by plane today and made a statement, saying: Regarding the pursuit of peace, the British people must be patient. We are not working for the present; we are working for the next hundred generations. Looking ahead, I am neither blindly optimistic nor pessimistic. The world has suffered from the ravages of war for six years, and the work of reconstruction will not be easy. Whether the Foreign Ministers' conference to be held in London in November will be more successful than the Moscow conference, I dare not predict at this time. When I left England, I thought that a peace treaty with Austria could be concluded, making Austria an independent country, but in fact, no agreement was reached. However, a committee has been established, and the date of the treaty is not far off.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Berlin, 28th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived here by train from Moscow at 3:15 PM today. After getting off the train, he went directly to the city with Marshal Douglas, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Germany, to hold talks with Sir Paganham, the new British Minister to Germany, and other senior British officials. Foreign Secretary Bevin will stay at Marshal Douglas's residence and is scheduled to fly back to London tomorrow.</p>
<p>Bidault Returns Home</p>

France's interests have been respected. We have also brought back some coal." (Referring to the Anglo-French coal agreement).</p>
<h3>Report on the Moscow Conference; Full Text of Marshall's Speech</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall delivered a radio address to the nation tonight, outlining the various issues and results of the recently concluded Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The full text of the speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Tonight, I hope to make the basic nature of the various issues discussed at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference completely clear to everyone.</p>
<p>This conference is discussing the heart of the peace that we are striving for. This conference is discussing the important centers of Europe—Germany and Austria. This is a region with many technically trained people, with great resources and factories. This is a region that has twice nearly brought the world to destruction. In the negotiations in Moscow, all the obvious disagreements regarding the Italian and Balkan treaties were raised, but in fact, they have not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>General discussions and ambiguous plans cannot deal with the difficulties that have a direct relationship with our future civilization. In order to deal with such difficulties, we must specifically solve various extremely complex issues, such as issues related to borders, production, and the control of the necessities of life for millions of people. Newspaper and radio reports have familiarized you with the daily activities of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. I need not say more, lest I repeat myself. However, due to the extremely complex nature of the three major issues we considered, I find it necessary to give a detailed report to describe my views on the various issues from my seat. Our hopes for a peace treaty with Austria and a German defense agreement in Moscow may be realized. As for the peace treaty with Germany and related issues (mostly current German issues), we had hoped to reach an agreement in principle so that our representatives would have something to follow in their work before the next meeting is held. In this broadcast, it is impossible to actually discuss the various issues that remain unresolved at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. I would like to draw people's attention to some basic issues, which, once resolved, may lead to the elimination of other disagreements.</p>
<p>The European Coal Supply Has a Far-Reaching Impact</p>
<p>Coal issue—the conference must not only consider the immediate impact of certain issues on the people of Europe in a few months, but also the complexity of the issues. To give an example, all of Europe needs more coal to supply factories, public utilities, railways, and households. However, many of the Allied coal mines cannot be mined unless those damaged coal mines, coal mining machinery, railway transport, and other equipment and tools are fully restored. These restoration works require more steel, and more steel in turn requires more coal to manufacture it. Therefore, we must remember one point: while the necessary restoration work is underway, the amount of coal that Allied neighboring countries may obtain in the near future will inevitably decrease.</p>
<p>The reduction in the amount of coal will gradually increase the number of unemployed in terms of labor and prolong the revitalization of production in terms of materials. These materials could have been exported for profit to purchase food and necessities. Therefore, the sluggishness of production has become an inevitable consequence of coal mine restoration work. This phenomenon has deeply affected France. Therefore, solving the coal issue has become a serious difficulty for France. However, in Germany, in addition to American loans, it must use coal for production and then export the products in exchange for the import of necessary food. Therefore, other countries, such as Britain and the Soviet Union, are also directly affected, but to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Negotiations on the German Issue Involve World Peace</p>
<p>Moreover, the coal issue, which is directly related to steel production, is underpinned by the important issue of the German heavy industrial base, which may become a threat to world peace again in the future. I cite this example to illustrate the various complex situations involved in these negotiations.</p>
<p>Germany—The Allied Control Council in Berlin submitted detailed reports on the political, military, economic, and financial situation under the current German military government. Regarding these issues, the foreign ministers considered the form and scope of the German provisional political institutions and the procedures to be followed in preparing the peace treaty with Germany.</p>
<p>Negotiations on the German issue not only involve the security of Europe and the world, but also the prosperity of the entire Europe. Our mission was to discuss the conditions of a long-term treaty, but at the same time, we are faced with various direct issues of great importance to the poor people of Europe, who are crying out for help, for coal, food, and most of the necessities of life. Most of them hate Germany, which caused this disaster. These issues are also of great importance to the people of Britain and the United States, who cannot continue to foot the bill for Germany, taking out hundreds of millions of dollars, because no measures have been taken to quickly end this appropriation.</p>
<p>The serious and fundamental German issues that concern me are: (1) the authority of the German central government; (2) the economic nature of Germany and its relationship with European countries; (3) the scope and nature of compensation; (4) the borders of Germany; (5) the issue of how all countries that fought against Germany should participate in drafting and signing the peace treaty with Germany.

<h3>Fubo Warship Tragedy Trial Begins; Relatives of the Deceased Surround Dai Ruling; Crying and Cursing, Demanding Compensation; Defendant Claims to Have Searched for Surviving Officers and Soldiers After the Collision; Order to Wait for Inspection of the Haimin Ship Before Further Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the sinking tragedy of the Fubo gunboat, the District Prosecutor's Office investigated and determined that the Haimin ship failed to make efforts to rescue the officers and soldiers of the Fubo warship after the collision, resulting in the death of 130 sailors at the bottom of the sea. The captain of the Haimin ship, Dai Ruling, was prosecuted on suspicion of murder. The case was initially heard in the Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Zhong Xianda yesterday morning at 9:30. In addition to questioning the defendant Dai Ruling, Jiao Dexiao (the only survivor of the Fubo warship), Wu Nianzu, Wu Kan (chief and second officers of the Haimin ship), Lang Fuxiang, Liu Fenfa, Ma Fugen, Zheng Jiaren, Zheng Guorong, Li Xiuming, Sun Junhua, Luo Qian, and others were summoned to testify. The court adjourned at noon, and Judge Zhong ordered that the two parties be convened to inspect the Haimin ship at 9:00 AM on May 6, and then schedule another trial. It was also decided that the District Court would jointly inspect the ship with the defendant's lawyer, Wei Wenda, Jiao Dexiao, and two representatives from the Naval Department.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 45 relatives of the officers and soldiers who died in the Fubo warship gathered at the District Court early in the morning to wait for the court to open. After Judge Zhong of Criminal Court II took his seat, the relatives of the officers and soldiers lined up and sat quietly in the front row of the audience. Dozens of students from the local law school also came to attend the hearing, and the courtroom was extremely crowded for a time.</p>
<p>Dai Ruling's Testimony: The Course of the Incident</p>
<p>Defendant Dai Ruling was first brought to the court. He testified that he was 42 years old, from Fujian Province, and was the captain of the Haimin ship. He had only been in the position for three months and had previously served as the captain of other ocean liners. The maximum sailing speed of the Haimin ship was 13 knots per hour, and the speed at the time of the collision at midnight on March 19 was 9.5 knots. At 0:00, the sea was completely dark, and the wind and waves were very high. A white light was discovered on the left side of the ship. At 0:07, a green light was seen, indicating that a ship was approaching. The Haimin ship immediately sounded the whistle once and immediately reversed the engine. However, it was too late to avoid the collision, but there was no major shock. At that time, it was not known that a ship had sunk. At this point, the court turned to question the second officer of the Haimin ship, Wu Kan, who testified that he was on the night shift that day. After discovering the white light in front at 0:00, the captain went to the deck to investigate. At the time of the collision, he roughly saw the Fubo warship sailing to the right corner. After the collision, Captain Dai immediately ordered the ship to stop, ordered me to send light signals, and used wireless radio to respond to the Fubo warship, but there was no response. After stopping the ship for about ten minutes and still receiving no response, they slowly sailed to search. About an hour later, they heard cries for help. They used a searchlight to search the sea and discovered Jiao Dexiao. They immediately steered the ship closer. Due to the strong wind and waves at the time, it took nearly two hours to rescue Jiao. Then the chief officer of the Haimin ship, Wu Nianzu, was questioned. He testified that he was asleep at the time of the collision. He was awakened and went to the deck to observe. He met the captain, who ordered him to check the damage to the ship. He saw nothing else. The testimonies of the helmsman and other crew members of the Haimin ship were roughly the same as those of the previous two.</p>
<p>Jiao Dexiao Claims: The Ship Sank Very Quickly</p>
<p>However, according to Jiao Dexiao, the only survivor of the Fubo warship, who was the chief engineer on the ship and is now 31 years old, he was asleep at the time of the collision. He was awakened by a loud noise, and the ship's body shook violently. Knowing that something had happened, he put on his clothes and went to the deck. He saw more than 70 people gathered on the deck, and the captain was directing the sending of emergency distress calls and using lights to send signals to the Haimin ship. They were also preparing lifeboats, life vests, buoys, and other escape equipment. Unexpectedly, the ship sank very quickly, sinking in about two or three minutes. I also went into the water with the ship. Because I had a life vest, I floated to the surface and grabbed a buoy. At that time, there were many officers and soldiers floating on the surface of the sea, and I heard cries for help. However, I saw the Haimin ship continuing to sail forward. After struggling with the wind and waves for nearly an hour, I saw a ship approaching, so I tried to get closer. By the time I was rescued on the ship, I was unconscious and unaware of anything.</p>
<p>A Sound of Sobbing in the Audience</p>
<p>When Jiao Dexiao testified, a sound of sobbing came from the relatives of the deceased officers and soldiers in the audience. The bailiffs immediately stepped forward to stop them. Judge Zhong then questioned Zheng Guorong, a passenger on the Haimin ship, who testified that he was asleep at the time of the incident, but he felt the ship was still moving, but he could not distinguish the direction. After ten minutes, he still did not see any movement. At that time, the passengers were all talking about it, because they were in the lower cabin and did not see what Dai Ruling was doing. At about 2:00 AM, they discovered Jiao Dexiao in the sea, and the sailors on the ship rescued him and pulled him up. Dai Ruling was questioned again. He testified that after the collision, according to the rules of navigation, he should first check whether the ship was in danger of sinking, so he stopped sailing for about ten minutes. At the same time, he ordered the second officer to use lights and wireless radio to try to contact the Fubo warship, but there was no response. Because the ship was reversing before the collision, and the Fubo warship had not stopped sailing, the distance between the ship and the Fubo warship was actually very far after the ship stopped. After the ship was inspected, it slowly sailed along the Fubo warship's route to search, so it was able to discover Jiao Dexiao.</p>
<p>Dark Night, High Waves, Difficult Rescue</p>
<p>The court inquired why it took so long to rescue Jiao Dexiao and whether he had any malicious intentions and was trying to silence him. Dai replied that rescuing people in the dark sea is not the same as on land. Moreover, when the ship is sailing, the wind and waves are even greater. Even if they are not drowned, they may be killed by the waves. Therefore, they must be especially careful. This can be explained by maritime experts. The court also questioned Ma Fugen, the sailor on the Haimin ship who rescued Jiao Dexiao, who testified that because he only saw Jiao alone in the sea, he did not launch a lifeboat and threw a lifebuoy five times. At that time, the wind and waves were treacherous, and rescue was difficult. The fifth time the lifebuoy was thrown, it was successful. The testimonies of the other witnesses did not have any new discoveries. After the court adjourned, when Dai was being escorted back to prison, the relatives of the deceased officers and soldiers, young and old, men and women, all rushed forward to surround Dai, crying and cursing in a chaotic scene, demanding compensation. After the bailiffs worked hard to disperse them, Dai was able to escape and enter the prison.</p>

<h3>Why Steal When You Own Property? Late-Night Theft Revealed While Hiring a Car: A Series of Crimes Committed by One Person</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The famous thief Quan Shiwen, also known as Little Shanghai and Langtou, is 25 years old, from Shanghai, skilled in martial arts, as light as a swallow, and able to scale walls and jump over obstacles at a height of two or three zhang. He owns a Western-style house at No. 5 Quanjiazhai on Ouyang Road in Pudong. At midnight on the 21st, he stole twelve large electric fans and six oscillating fans from No. 15, Lane 237, Duolun Road. Afterwards, he hired a Chariot Car from the Sichuan North Road and Dixiwei Road intersection to transport the electric fans to Wu Changgao's house in Caopeng, North Station. At that time, because he did not have the money to pay the fare, he gave one of the electric fans to the driver as payment. When the driver drove back to the car company and took out the electric fan, it happened to be seen by the police officers of the Sichuan Road Police Station's patrol team. Because it was midnight, they asked the driver sternly where the electric fan came from in the car, and he confessed the truth.</p>
<p>After the police officers reported to Deputy Bureau Chief Zeng, he immediately ordered Wu Zhenlong, the head of the criminal section, to supervise inspectors Liu Zhaonian, police chief Ren Hou, Gu Wenyue, and police officers Shen Changqi and Li Zhiming to go to the aforementioned location in the Caopeng and arrest Wu Changgao for interrogation. According to his confession, the electric fans belonged to Quan Shiwen and he did not know where they were stolen from. At first, he wanted to store them at Yu's house, but he refused. Quan then tried to move them elsewhere. He also made an appointment to come to Yu's residence again at noon the next day. After the Wu Section Chief took the confession, he sent officers to wait there. When Quan arrived as scheduled, he was arrested and brought to the bureau for questioning. He directly admitted to committing numerous crimes: (1) No. 15, Lane 237, Duolun Road. (2) Wang Genlin's house at No. 3, Xiang'an Lane, Bao'an Road. (3) No. 99, Lane 202, Duolun Road. (4) No. 4, Lane 1377, Dixiwei Road. (5) Xu Yun's house at No. 6, Lane 705, the same road. (6) Zhang Aiping's house at No. 6, Lane 137, the same road. In the above six houses, he stole bicycles, radios, electric fans, etc., worth more than 200 million yuan. They were all sold and squandered. However, he denied having accomplices and insisted that all the crimes were committed by him alone. The stolen goods that have been retrieved by the branch bureau include six bicycles, four men's and women's overcoats, three five-tube radios, three raincoats, one air gun, and a batch of woolen cloth worth about 50 million yuan. The owners have claimed the goods. The interrogation has now been completed, and it is planned to transfer the case to the judicial authorities for trial soon.</p>

<h3>Unfilial Son: Attempting to Rape Stepmother: Owner of a Tea Garden Detained</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Du Qunfa, 25 years old, the owner of the Fuxing Tea Garden at No. 1640 Changning Road, Zhoujiaqiao, western Shanghai, was spoiled and raised and was extravagant. Du's father died early, leaving behind a wife and a concubine. The wife, Xu, is 54 years old, and the concubine, Zhang, is only 27 years old. Du Qunfa is the legitimate son and often harbored improper thoughts about his stepmother. On the 20th of this month, he tried to rape his stepmother.

<h3>The Androgynous Person Has Great Supernatural Powers: Sensational in Peiping Ten Years Ago: Imprisoned and Almost Killed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "androgynous person" Shen Junru, reported by our newspaper yesterday, has been transferred to the local prosecutor's office by the police station and has been detained for investigation. However, according to investigations by reporters from various sources, the perpetrator is the one who caused a sensation in Peiping ten years ago, luring the concubine of a certain important person and being arrested by the then Mayor of Peiping, Zhang Xueliang. It was originally planned to be punished by law, but in the end, because the "demon" had great magic power, it was finally dealt with by deportation. When the perpetrator was in custody, they still liked to wear men's clothing. After being severely reprimanded by the guards, they began to correct their attire, but their every move had lost the nature of a woman. As for the crimes committed in Peiping, they were roughly the same as those committed in this city. Therefore, there were many wives of dignitaries in Peiping who had contact with this "demon." At that time, they were known as "Fifth Master." After the demon was deported, they once lived in seclusion in Hangzhou. Unexpectedly, shortly after the victory, they sneaked into Shanghai, revived their business, and used their special skills to seduce respectable women. In the end, they were arrested again. In addition to the three victims who were arrested at the same time, it is heard that they are also involved with the concubine of a certain celebrity and the former concubine of a certain vice minister. It is said that the perpetrator once married a man surnamed He as a concubine in Peiping and even had a son. Later, due to emotional breakdown, they separated. Since then, they have engaged in licentious and shameless activities.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Unlicensed Buildings: Expanding the Construction Ban Area for Shantytowns</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The meeting to crack down on illegal buildings in this city was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the conference room of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, chaired by Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau. The matters decided upon for discussion are as follows: (1) It was decided to restore the patrol car team in early May, cooperating with the police bureau and the public works bureau, to patrol various districts, advise new shantytowns to demolish, and individually crack down on existing shantytowns. (2) Unlicensed buildings in this city will be investigated and cracked down on. (3) When the nature of the use of a house changes (such as from a residence to a school or institution), the Public Works Bureau must be notified, and a permit must be reapplied for. Attention should be paid to public safety facilities. (4) Expand the construction ban area for shantytowns in this city. In addition to the original designated old British and French concessions, Hongkou, and areas within ten meters of major routes where shantytowns are not allowed to be built, it will be extended to Qujiang Road, from the urban area of Nanshi to the east to the Huangpu River. (5) Various illegal buildings at the entrances of lanes must be strictly restricted. According to Zhou Zhaoxiang, the director of the fire department, they, whether directly or indirectly, are sufficient to endanger the safety of all residents in the lane. (6) Recently, fires have been frequent in this city. It is necessary to ensure that fire prevention knowledge penetrates the people. It was decided that the civil affairs office will instruct various baojia to promote and disseminate it.</p>
<h3>Wage-Price Disconnect Too Far: Labor Problem Experts Advocate: Index Should Be Restored</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting within days to study the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index. However, because unfreezing the index may hinder government orders, the association may seek other ways to find appropriate solutions to improve the lives of workers under the high pressure of prices and recommend that the central government adopt them. A reporter visited a labor problem expert yesterday to inquire about their opinion on this issue. They expressed absolute support for unfreezing. When the government initially ordered the freeze, it stated that it would do its best to suppress prices. However, as evidenced by the facts in recent months, today's prices are far too disconnected from the index in January. If we want to continue freezing it for a long time and disregard the lives of employees, it is really too unfair. If it is said that it is to maintain the government's prestige, then at least other methods should be used to remedy the situation as soon as possible. The reason why workers are causing resentment now is because of the sudden and wild jump in prices, causing psychological imbalance. If prices had risen gradually, workers would probably not have been so dissatisfied. In the past, various parties have discussed whether prices stimulate wages or wages stimulate prices. The fact that prices continued to rise wildly after the freezing of the workers' cost of living index can prove that wages did not stimulate prices. However, now, if the workers' cost of living index is unfrozen and suddenly restored from more than 7,900 times in January to the appropriate multiples in April, whether this will stimulate price increases should also be carefully considered beforehand. In short, regardless of whether to unfreeze the index or find other ways without unfreezing it, attention should be paid to the living problems of employees as soon as possible. Otherwise, if workers' lives cannot be maintained, disputes will inevitably continue to emerge.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Committee Studies Remedial Measures: Plans to Increase the Number of Daily Necessities Calculated</h3>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Last time, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to Nanjing and requested instructions on the issue of unfreezing the index from Zhang, the President of the Executive Yuan, and Gu, the Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs. He has now instructed the various expert members of the Shanghai Labor-Capital Evaluation Committee to form a subcommittee to study it. The subcommittee is scheduled to meet on May 3rd and will formulate measures based on the results of the study and submit them to the highest authorities for adoption and implementation, seeking remedial measures in the event of soaring prices without violating the principles of the government's economic plan. It is heard that the expert members advocate that, in addition to the original six types of rice, coal, oil, sugar, salt, and cloth for differential allowances, various other daily necessities in the cost of living index should be increased, so that professional workers and industrial workers can maintain their current minimum living standards.</p>
<h3>Busting a Car Theft Gang: Led by a Korean, Committing Ten Crimes Over Several Months: Detectives Disguised as Car Buyers: Arresting People and Recovering Stolen Goods Near Nanyang Bridge</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fourth Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters recently received a tip-off that there is an international car theft gang organization in this city, led by a young Korean man named Li Yiping. He has more than ten accomplices who are skilled at stealing and robbing. They wear Western suits, enter and exit social venues, and specialize in stealing jeeps and various vehicles when people are unprepared. After multiple investigations, a lead was obtained on the 25th of this month. However, the organization is quite strict and difficult to deal with. After discussions, it was decided to raise 7 million yuan first and send officers in disguise to the Dashanyuan teahouse, which is contacted by the gang, under the pretext of buying jeeps on behalf of customers. Negotiations were held repeatedly with a man named Jin Yunze. Finally, a price of 30 million yuan per vehicle was agreed upon. To show good faith, a deposit of 7 million yuan was paid first, and it was agreed to exchange goods and money at the intersection of Nanyang Bridge and Xizang South Road that evening on the 27th. On the due date, the Inspection Brigade dispatched a large number of personnel to lie in ambush in the Nanyang Bridge area in advance. At about 10:00 PM, a military jeep with the license plate number 18523 of the First United States Military Forces in Shanghai, driven by a Russian, arrived. In addition to the Russian, there were also the contact person, the Korean Jin Yunze, Cui Zhongtai, and another Russian, who were all arrested. After being interrogated, the two Russians confessed that one was named Gu Lie Liti (residing at No. 58, Lane 222, Gongping Road) and the other was named Nalis. The vehicle they were driving had just been stolen from the US military parking lot at the Shichuan Building on Pushi Road. However, they stubbornly refused to reveal the location of the leader and accomplices, only saying that they had been doing this for several months and had stolen about ten vehicles, all of which were sold immediately. One of the vehicles was sold to the Sanxing Car Company on Pingliang Road two months ago, and the proceeds had already been squandered. After the team received the confession, they immediately rushed to the Sanxing Car Company and arrested the manager, Qian Rongsheng. After interrogation, he admitted to receiving stolen goods. In addition to transferring the above-mentioned criminals to the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters for verification, the team is still sending personnel to continue the investigation to ensure that all accomplices are brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Bill Dispute: Hu Hao Accused</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Hu Hao, son of the overseas Chinese tycoon Hu Wenhu, and currently the director of the Sing Tao Football Team, was sued in the district court by a merchant named Min Zhenhan after news of the Sing Tao team's expedition to Shanghai was published in the newspapers. According to the complaint, in September of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), when Hu Hao was in Chongqing from Hong Kong, he purchased five boxes of menthol from Min Zhenhan, paying with three checks from the Chongqing branch of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and two checks from the Zhenye Bank, totaling 9.87 million yuan. The day after the transaction, Hu Hao took a plane and left the country. Three days later, when Min Zhenhan went to the bank to cash the checks, he was surprised to find that they had all been dishonored. He urgently went to the Yixin Garden Hotel to look for Hu Hao, only to find out that he had already left the country. He contacted Hu Wenhu via telegram for negotiations, but without result. Unable to do anything else, he filed a lawsuit in the Chongqing District Court. After a trial in absentia, Hu Hao was fined 90,000 yuan and ordered to pay back the amount of the checks plus interest. However, Hu Hao never returned and his whereabouts were unknown, making enforcement impossible. Now, upon learning that the Sing Tao Football Team was coming to Shanghai, it was assumed that Hu Hao would accompany the team, so a request was made to the district court for immediate detention and an order to repay the previous debt. After receiving the complaint, the district court summoned Hu Hao through the Sing Tao team, but Hu himself did not accompany the team to Shanghai this time, and the district court still has no way to enforce the judgment.</p>
<h3>Social Service: Shen Bao Newspaper and Relief Hospital Jointly Organize Prevention and Treatment of Trachoma - An Overview</h3>
<p>Six Thousand Consultations Conducted Over Eight Months, More Than Four Hundred People Cured</p>
<p>Trachoma is a disease that is very widespread in our country, affecting an estimated 70% or more of the entire population, especially young men and women. Early-stage trachoma is often not easily detected, and therefore often ignored. By the time the root of the disease is deep, treatment is often difficult to achieve satisfactory results. This leads to further transmission, like a spark igniting a prairie fire. At best it affects personal health and career, but at worst it harms the nation and the people. With this in mind, our newspaper, in conjunction with the Relief Hospital on South Tibet Road in this city, launched a "Trachoma Prevention and Treatment Campaign" starting on August 1st of last year. Now, nine months later, although we do not presume to eradicate this disease completely, we hope to draw the attention of the people, and hope that young people will be vigilant about this disease! Since this prevention and treatment campaign began on August 1st of last year, it has undergone five phases. As of March 31st, the number of people applying for examination and treatment totaled 594, most of whom were middle school students, followed by university and elementary school students, and then teachers and staff. On average, each person received ten treatments, totaling more than six thousand treatments. According to the hospital's comprehensive statistics, most of those who applied for examination and treatment had stage two trachoma, totaling 241 people. Stage one patients were the second most numerous, with 142 people. The other stages three and four were only a dozen or so people.</p>
<p>As for the medical work, it was all the responsibility of the hospital's doctors. Medicines such as silver nitrate, silver sulfate, and yellow mercury ointment were all provided free of charge by the hospital. Among them, nine people underwent surgical treatment, which was performed voluntarily by Dr. Sun Yuanming of the hospital's ophthalmology department, without charging a single penny. According to the hospital's statistics, about 70% of those treated have recovered, which is still far from the planned goals. In the future, we will increase our efforts to achieve greater results and express our sincere gratitude to the enthusiastic people from all walks of life for their support.</p>

<h3>Tsinghua's 36th Anniversary Celebration: Alumni in Shanghai Celebrated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the 36th anniversary of Tsinghua University. The Tsinghua Alumni Association in this city held a grand celebration at the 4th floor of the Bank of China, attended by more than 600 alumni. The scene was extremely lively. Around 6 o'clock, the dinner began. Many alumni had been separated for more than ten years. Once they reunited in one hall, they could not help but feel emotional, both sad and happy. Tang Xinghai and Lu Meiseng, classmates from the class of 1920, were in high spirits and took the lead in cheering. Thereupon, cheers arose one after another, like thunder. The class of 1909 was the earliest class, and all three classmates in Shanghai attended. Amid the enthusiastic applause of the audience, they also linked arms and cheered three times. Because yesterday was the first anniversary of Tsinghua's return to Beiping, the significance was different from the past, and the alumni's joy was even greater than in previous years. The association originally invited Mayor Wu and former President Weng Yongni to give speeches last night, but both Mr. Wu and Mr. Weng were unable to attend due to official business in Beijing. Therefore, Wang Zuliang, the president of the association this year, delivered a speech, sincerely encouraging the alumni to maintain the spirit of Tsinghua and to manage affairs with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, only knowing how to fulfill their duties and not knowing how to perfunctorily cope. Because of this, the struggles of the alumni in society have always been like the lone battle of classmate Sun Liren in those years. Although the fighting spirit has not been lost, the sacrifices are often extremely heavy. Therefore, in the future, we must strengthen unity and close cooperation to exert a greater force. We do not want to seek personal gain, we only seek to work together to be loyal to the country. We firmly believe that the unity of Tsinghua alumni, the exertion of strength, will surely make the country's future more brilliant. Wang then suggested that Shanghai alumni raise 100,000,000 yuan to build an "Alumni Hall" in the alma mater. Alumni Tang Xinghai, Xi Lun, and others immediately responded and were willing to assist in the grand event. Next, the Chinese Orchestra, led by Professor Wei Zhongle, performed Chinese music. This once-a-year celebration was announced to have ended in the sound of lively music.</p>

<h3>Xingdao Easily Defeats Jewish Team, Result 8-1, Victory Described Lightly</h3>
<p>Hong Kong's Xingdao expeditionary force played its second match in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5 PM against the Jewish team at the Yi Guo Stadium. Over ten thousand spectators attended, and the police and constabulary worked hard to maintain excellent order. The match resulted in an easy 8-1 victory for Xingdao over the Jewish team.</p>
<p>The referee was Liang Guansong, the linesmen were 　Feng　 and Carlo Li District. Xingdao presented 　　, and the match began immediately. The Jewish team initially adopted an offensive strategy, but it was blocked by Xu Jingcheng. Liu Songsheng obtained the ball and passed it far forward. He Yingfen attempted a shot in front of the Jewish goal, but McNitty lightly caught it. Zhu Yongqiang attacked again, but was offside. At six minutes, "Little Three Son" Cao Qiuting had his first corner kick, which was also caught by McNitty. The Jewish players seized the opportunity to attack twice. Fu En received assistance from Demanya and made a close-range attack, but unfortunately, it went out of bounds. Shortly after, Koppstein also attempted a shot, but to no avail. Fu En and Kebitsky encircled the Xingdao goal, but fortunately, Hou Rongsheng saved the day, defusing the danger. This was the peak of the Jewish attack within the first quarter of an hour after the start of the match.</p>

<p>At sixteen minutes, Xingdao launched an all-out attack. Zhu Yongqiang broke through an opening and shot powerfully, but McNitty risked everything and tackled Zhu Yongqiang at his feet, like Zhao Yun saving A Dou. At seventeen minutes, Xue Pansiting committed a foul in the penalty area, causing a major penalty. Zhang Jinhai took the penalty kick, but McNitty dived sideways to save it. The two sides fought fiercely until the twenty-first minute. Koppstein committed a foul by colliding with a player 25 yards from the goal. Zhu Yongqiang took the free kick, and Zou Wenzhi headed the ball across. McNitty missed the catch, and He Yingfen seized the opportunity to catch up and push the ball into the net, making it 1-0. The away team opened the scoring, and their morale was high, creating dangerous situations in front of the Jewish goal. At twenty-five minutes, Zhang Jinhai went in alone and scored again, making it 2-0. However, Cao Qiuting was already offside when the Jewish team conceded this goal, but the referee did not notice it. After that, the Jewish players experienced a psychological breakdown, resulting in a disorganized formation, which Xingdao took advantage of. By the thirtieth minute, Zhang Jinhai scored another goal, making it 3-0. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Jewish player Stan En passed the ball to Fu En in the center, who shot powerfully, but Zhu Zhaoheng's movements were clumsy, allowing them to pull back one goal, making it 3-1. Shortly after, Xu Jingcheng injured his ankle and left the field. Feng Kunsheng replaced him, and exchanged positions with Jinzai. The first half then ended.</p>
<p>After the break, the two teams switched sides and resumed the match. Taking advantage of the momentum from the first half, Xingdao launched an all-out attack. Cao Qiuting single-handedly broke into the Jewish territory. At a critical moment, McNitty bravely punched the ball out, but it landed at Zhang Jinhai's feet. Zhang Jinhai took the opportunity to shoot powerfully. McNitty thought he was offside and did not try to block the shot, so the ball rolled into the net. The referee ruled it as a goal, making it 4-1. At five minutes, Jewish main player Demanya was injured and left the field, and Fuli Lun entered the field. Xingdao took advantage of their weakness and launched a five-pronged attack, but they couldn't break through. The two sides fought fiercely until the thirty-first minute when He Yingfen successfully launched another sneak attack, making it 5-1. At the last minute, Cao Qiuting went in alone and succeeded immediately, making it 6-1. At thirty-five minutes, Li Zhaorong and Xue Pansiting collided, and the foreign soldier was injured. They had to play with ten men, creating numerous loopholes. At forty-three minutes, Tang Nasi caused a penalty. Zhu Yongqiang scored with one kick, making it 7-1. Three minutes before the end of the match, Li Zhaorong scored again, making it 8-1. Shortly after, the whistle blew, and Xingdao won a major victory over the Jewish team with a score of 8-1.</p>
<h3>Yanjing University Sports Meet Scheduled for May 10th</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Beijing dispatch on the 29th] Yanjing University has scheduled its sports meet for May 10th. It is reported that alumni from the school in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin will come to Beijing to participate that day. The school's provost, Situ Leideng, may also return to the school at that time.</p>
<h3>Football Association Refuses to Share the Spoils, Referee Angrily Refuses to Officiate</h3>
<p>The members of the Football Referees Association did not appear to serve as referees in yesterday's match between Xingdao and Youben, causing suspicion from all circles. Tan Jing, the chairman of the association, made the following statement regarding this matter: "Four weeks ago, our association contacted the Football Committee regarding subsidies for our association. Several members of the Football Committee agreed to bring it up for discussion, but it was shelved. The committee clearly lacks sincerity in cooperating with our association. Therefore, before Xingdao's first appearance, we notified the committee that our association would no longer assign members to serve Xingdao's matches. However, for the match between Xingdao and Hancheng, Association Secretary-General Shao Rugan, Football Committee Chairman Da Qizhao, Committee Member Wang Xinheng, and Secretary-General Zhou Jiaqi discussed with me before the match and promised to raise the issue in the committee meeting. To take the overall situation into consideration, we still sent our members to attend. Unexpectedly, the issue was not brought up for discussion at the committee meeting on the 27th. Therefore, after yesterday afternoon's general meeting of all members of our association, we decided to no longer cooperate with the Football Committee and have already sent a letter to notify the committee. However, there are two points that should be solemnly stated: (1) The current stalemate is purely due to the Football Committee's lack of sincerity in cooperating with our association, and the subsidy is secondary. (2) The unfinished order of this season's league and the Mayor's Cup was handled by our association members who were hired by the committee, and they will still attend to see it through. In addition, we will refuse to cooperate with all other competitions organized by the Football Committee."</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Cup Game, China and U.S. Teams Battle Again Tonight</h3>
<p>The Roosevelt Cup China-U.S. basketball game opened at the city stadium the other day. As a result, China defeated the U.S. and won the victory. The second match will be held at the same venue again at 7:30 PM tonight. Zheng Zhifang and Jin Zuotao will be the referees. If China wins again, they will win the cup; otherwise, a third decisive battle will be held the following day to determine who will be the champion. Tickets are sold for 5,000 for the upper level and 8,000 for the lower level, and the proceeds will be used for charitable expenses. Military police must also purchase tickets to enter, and long-term passes are suspended. Ticket sales will begin at 5 PM, and the doors will open at 6 PM. The Gezhi Boy Scouts and military police will maintain order. Before the game, Mayor Wu will be invited to present the Mayor's Cup Class A silver cup because the Class A championship team, the U.S. Navy's Columbus, will be leaving Shanghai shortly, so the award is being given in advance.</p>
<p>In the first match, the Chinese athletes fully demonstrated their superior skills and teamwork. Relying on their concerted efforts, they were able to break through the U.S. military's defense and achieve victory. The lineup arrangement was quite appropriate. With Hualian as the king, supplemented by Liu Fushan and Ma Canxi, the peony and green leaves complemented each other. If Cai Yanxiong's foot injury is healed today, he may as well try to play. Now that China has won the first match, tonight's gains and losses are even more important. It is hoped that the generals will continue to work hard and strive to win two consecutive victories against the U.S. military and win the cup. The U.S. military is represented by Columbus, so not only is its combat power formidable, but its cooperation is also seamless. Ash possesses skilled game skills, and his shots are accurate. The fans unanimously praised him as the most dangerous person. Players such as Bloary and Johnson are also intelligent and courageous, and are top-notch talents. Since the U.S. military lost in the opening battle, they will definitely seek revenge when they meet again today. It is predicted that there will be an even more intense and fierce competition with our Chinese team at that time. A bloody battle is inevitable. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Chinese Team) Li Zhenzhong (Captain), Kong Guangyi, Bao Songyuan, Ren Xiangcheng, He Lide, Wu Chengzhang, Yang Weicong, Yao Wenyi, Ma Canxi, Zhu Mingxing, Chen Xuechong, Chen Qingjiang, Cai Yanxiong, Liu Fushan.</p>
<p>(U.S. Team) Bloary, Big Johnson, Little Johnson, Ash, Polavete, Oberang, Bonat, Qu Linghuo, Cobb, Bock, Xiong Luoning, Lesmi, Koenig, Langen.</p>
<h3>Football Affairs on the Island are Languid, South China's Morale is Depressed</h3>
<p>The football league has reached the end of the season, and most of the battles are unimportant. Three Class A matches were held on the 26th (Saturday), and only China won, while South China and Eastern lost.</p>
<p>On the South China field, Eastern first lost to the Deyun team 2-0. South China then played and was defeated by the Air Force 3-2. Although South China's lineup was incomplete, the Air Force was not a strong team either. The reason for the loss was depressed morale, and there is nothing to say! Only China defeated the stubborn British 42nd Battalion at the Hong Kong venue, which is commendable. The score was three to zero.</p>
<p>For Xingdao's expedition to Shanghai, the team's main player, "Magic Leg" Feng Jingxiang, did not go to Shanghai to supervise the battle because he had an accumulation of blood and needed to recuperate in order to prepare to lead the army on a long trip to England. Xingdao has now won this year's double championship. The awards ceremony will be held on May 4th, with the champion playing against the league team.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong People Think the Vietnamese Team's Style is Too Barbaric</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Hong Kong airmail] In the Vietnamese football team's last match in Hong Kong, they played against Hualian on the 24th. Because Hualian's main force, Xingdao, had a trip to Shanghai, they were unable to send players, and the lineup was not ideal.</p>
<p>At the start of the match, Hualian took advantage of the wind and Liu Rongguang kicked one into the army. Shi Jin scored a penalty, taking the lead with a score of 2-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Switching sides, the Vietnamese team gained the wind and, combined with their speed, they scored three goals in five minutes, turning defeat into victory. Afterwards, the Vietnamese team scored two more goals, and Hualian also scored one, making it 5-3, with the Vietnamese team winning the final victory.</p>
<p>Overall, the Vietnamese team's four matches were half wins and half losses, which is not a bad result. The general impression of Hong Kong people is that the whole team's barbaric style is too strong. In the last match, Li Wenya even laid his hands on Xie Jinhe, which is absolutely not in the spirit of sports. As a visiting team, they should not have performed in such a way.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been light rain, which has affected the progress of football events. After the Vietnamese basketball team arrived in Hong Kong, the schedule has been repeatedly delayed since their victory over Da Zhonghua. The second act was only able to continue at Jiaoshan on the 25th. The opponent was the Zhongqing team. There were few spectators, and only eleven tickets were sold.</p>
<p>In this battle, Zhongqing only had five players on the field, and Zhong Zhiqiang and Xin Zhongjian were also short of breath. The Vietnamese team should have won the victory, but they lost 39-38, which was disappointing.</p>

<h3>Although the Social Affairs Bureau Raised the Dumping Price Yesterday, the Limit Price of White Rice Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>The Prices of Edible Oil, Flour, Grains, etc. All Rise Together</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The rice market situation has not improved. Although general rice shops are still open as usual, most of them have no rice to supply. Those that do have mostly sell red Xian and broken rice. White rice can mostly only be found on the black market. The authorities are paying close attention to the phenomenon that 9,000 bags of rice are dumped daily, but the rice shops in the market have no goods to supply. They are deeply concerned that unscrupulous rice merchants are playing tricks and are currently sending personnel to secretly investigate. Regarding the overall supply and sales of the rice market and the price in the production areas, a comprehensive decision can be made after Mayor Wu attends the National Price Conference and returns to Shanghai this morning. A total of 2,140 stones arrived at the north and south markets yesterday. No transactions were made in white rice. The Social Affairs Bureau dumped a total of 9,000 bags of white rice and Siamese rice yesterday, at a price of 147,000 yuan, which is 11,500 yuan higher than the previous 135,500 yuan. According to Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the Food Section, the reason for this is that the municipal government's order for rice merchants to reduce the door sales limit price of 168,000 yuan was unsuccessful, so the dumping price was increased, while the door sales limit price remained at 168,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of flour, oil, grains, etc. all rose together. The price of soybean oil from this factory was 550,000 yuan, up 15,000 yuan. The price of Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil was 580,000 yuan, up 30,000 yuan from yesterday. The price of pure raw oil was 530,000 yuan, up 30,000 yuan. The price of agar was 117,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. The price of local flour was 81,500 yuan, up 2,500 yuan. The price of bran was 63,000 yuan, up 3,500 yuan. The price of Qingdao raw peanuts was 300,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. The price of Dalian green beans was 160,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. The price of Dalian Yuan beans was 163,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan, up about 5,000 yuan. The price of Ningbo picked white broad beans was 195,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the oil market could not keep up with sales and was extremely profitable. The soaring trend was very sharp, with prices rising sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. At noon, Wang Zhongqing, the leader of the economic supervision group of the Oil High Industry Association, instructed Zhang Chao, the chairman of the board of directors, to find a way to stabilize oil prices.</p>
<p>Also, Huang Jiaju, a specialist commissioner of the municipal government, and Wu Yimin, an inspector from the Social Affairs Bureau, investigated the sales situation of various rice shops in the Hongkou area yesterday. The general situation was very good. It was said that a few rice shops did not keep accounts, so there was no way to audit them, and it was heard that a report will be submitted for verification and handling.</p>
<h3>As the Deferred Settlement Draws Near and Credit Tightens, Bullish Traders in Chinese Stocks Emerge</h3>
<p>As the deferred settlement of Chinese stocks approached yesterday, credit tightened. Bullish traders in the industry were unwilling to bear the premium loss again and mostly emerged, but some outside capital still infiltrated, and miscellaneous stocks remained firm. The process was stable.</p>

The prices of underwear and domestic goods each fell by half a percent, Wuhe slightly rose, and the rest slightly fell.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>Because the evening newspaper reported that the Stock Exchange denied the cancellation of deferred settlement and the shrinking of Shen Dian, people's hearts improved. The price of Di Yong Yarn opened high at 5,000 yuan. Numbers 126 and 231 bought in. Qinxing, Jiufu, Jinglun, Xin Ya, and Zhongsi all rose to the limit. Number 205, 185, 223, 8, 144, 94, and 160 sold out from 5,030 yuan, and the price gradually fell to 4,870 yuan. Numbers 153, 232, 94, 231, 13, and 186 took in at low prices and rose to 5,000 yuan. Numbers 36, 117, 76, and 131 sold again at high prices. The price of Meiya Match also rose to the limit, without much impact. Yong Yarn was sold in sets and then forced down to around 4,870 yuan. After that, a range-bound pattern formed. Number 97 bought in, and numbers 180 and 190 sold out, without much special change.

<h3>The Stock Exchange Denies Stopping Deferred Settlement</h3>

It is claimed that deferred settlement was submitted for approval in advance, and so far, no order to stop deferred settlement has been received. Regarding the auction of U.S. dollar bonds, the Exchange authorities expressed a warm welcome. They have already opened a trading place on the second floor, and more than 40 brokers are available. In the future, when the auction officially opens, the number of brokers will definitely increase. In short, all preparations for the auction of U.S. dollar bonds are ready. Once the authorities order it, it can be implemented at any time.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Shipped to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Taikoo Company's Shengjing Wheel sailed from Shanghai to Hong Kong this afternoon. In addition to loading more than 1,500 pieces of groceries, there were also 1,210 pieces of cotton yarn. It is said that the yarn was purchased by the British government in Hong Kong from the China Textile Company.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The yarn market opened flat yesterday. Later, scattered households had a very strong appetite, and the guest brokers saw the low price and added to their purchases. The destocking was smooth, and the market price immediately turned from hovering to rising. Various yarn companies traded vigorously because the period for the authorities to order the clearing of existing yarn was about to expire. More than 700 bales were traded. The prices of 42-count and 20-count yarn rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, while the prices of 16-count yarn saw mixed gains and losses.</p>
<h3>The Rising Wind of Cotton Cloth Has Not Been Restrained</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth trading was still brisk yesterday. The market was still mainly trading spot goods. The export berths were sufficient, and the guest brokers' replenishment purchases were not quiet. 12-pound leading brand fine cloth was priced as high as 366,000 yuan.

<h3>UNRRA Transports Cotton to China, Totaling 110,000 Bales</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the total number of cotton bales that the UNRRA has arrived in Shanghai has reached 110,000 bales. There are still 35,000 bales that have been loaded onto ships to China. There are no problems with the above amount. It is currently in negotiations to transport 180,000 to 200,000 more bales of cotton to China.</p>
<h3>Flour Industry Requests Government to Quickly Resolve Raw Material Supply</h3>
<p>Wheat Purchasing Loans Have Been Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the flour industry association told reporters: In the past, during this lean season, our country's wheat supply relied on imported wheat to keep factories running. Now, the stock in the producing areas is very small, and there is no news of imported wheat, resulting in two major characteristics in the domestic wheat market: exceptionally high prices and an unexpectedly long supply period. This year's international wheat production is a bumper harvest. The purchasing department of the China Trust Bureau has ordered 100,000 tons of wheat from Argentina through the International Grain Conference, and negotiations are actively underway, with a decision expected in the near future. Recently, the price ratio of wheat to flour in the international market has been 1:1.52. Yesterday, the price of Wuxi wheat in China was 2120 yuan per pound, and the price of flour was 1880 yuan per pound, a ratio of 1:1.32, which is lower than the standard in the foreign market. Moreover, currently 1.5 bags of flour can be exchanged for one shi of Xian rice, making it difficult for flour mills to operate. This is not just a problem in Shanghai. The new wheat will not be available for another two months, and the supply in this city urgently needs to be resolved. For various reasons, factories have temporarily suspended using the wheat purchasing loans from the authorities. What the factories are now requesting from the government is not to increase legal profits, but the problem of raw materials. Mayor Wu will raise this for discussion at the upcoming national price conference. In the future, the allocation may be entirely supplied by the Ministry of Food. If so, the quota will be reduced again.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Rice Market Exhausted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 29th Telegram] The Hangzhou rice market is surging. The Food Review Council has legally set the price of white rice at 160,000 yuan per dan. On the 28th, the price of Xiashi rice tended to fall. On the 29th, the price of coarse rice in the suburbs of Hangzhou suddenly rose to 220,000 yuan. The Hangzhou rice market is again without rice, and the baskets are empty.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Grain Prices Soar</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tianjin 29th Telegram] Grain prices in Tianjin have been rising continuously for several days, setting an alarming record today. Shoufeng flour is 150,000 yuan per small bag, retail rice is 3,000 yuan per jin, and corn flour is 1,000 yuan per jin. People in the streets and lanes are sighing about the grain price problem.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten due to the scarcity of spot goods. Peruvian fine sand initially rose by 10,000 yuan, then by 120,000 yuan, already exceeding the 400,000 yuan mark. Other white sugars also rose across the board following the rise of local sugar. Shantou Qing was 265,000 yuan, Huanggang Qing was 260,000 yuan, Shunde Qing was 250,000 yuan, and Diao Qing was 244,500 yuan. Xinghua white bagged was 370,000 yuan, and louvered was 360,000 yuan. Xing red was 267,000 yuan, and Hainan red was 225,000 yuan to 235,000 yuan, an increase of 10% or so.</p>
<h3>Export Tea Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, buyers in the foreign tea market were still selective, while sellers, due to cost considerations, were unwilling to reduce prices further. As a result, the outcome of negotiations between the two parties tended to be a stalemate. Only Wang Yutai and Wu Chang Tea Company slightly touched the Qi Men tea from the third batch of the 35th year, while the rest were quiet. Prices remained unchanged. The sales of various domestic teas were also lackluster, and the process was unusually calm. However, the Yingkou gang suddenly showed a good appetite for last year's Bailin black tea, and trading revived. By the close of the market, more than 1,000 boxes had been traded, with prices ranging from 170,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan per dan. With the situation in balance, the price remained stable. Also, new Longjing tea from various routes in Hangzhou has arrived in large quantities recently, but the quality is deteriorating day by day. Competitors are frequently lowering prices, but confidence remains, and the market atmosphere is still ostensibly falling but secretly stable.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Price Increases</h3>
<p>The price of kerosene has recently risen sharply due to the scarcity of company allocations, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in the manager's offices. It is said that some dealers have received bulk kerosene at a price of 460,000 yuan per barrel, plus 18,000 yuan for the iron can. Therefore, the selling price of canned kerosene has suddenly increased, reaching 70,000 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Longan and Lychee Are Both Expensive</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of new arrivals of miscellaneous longan, the market situation is tightening again. A small number of lots were opened yesterday, and the price rose by slightly less than 10%. The price of ordinary dried longan also broke the one million yuan mark, and the price of Lanzhu lychee rose by 10% to 20%.</p>
<h3>National Textile Association to Hold Annual Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The 12th annual meeting of the National Textile Industry Association will be held tomorrow (May 1st) at Yi Garden. Representatives from various regions have already registered, and the proposals submitted are being reviewed in groups by the meeting. After several discussions, the association itself also plans to submit three proposals: (1) Oppose the import of Japanese cotton textile products to China, (2) Increase the production of domestic cotton, and (3) Improve regulatory measures. These proposals will be submitted to the central authorities after being passed by the general assembly as recommendations for the national textile industry.</p>
<h3>Rationed Sugar Starts May 1st, Priced at 2,100 Yuan Per Jin</h3>
<p>The rationing of sugar in this city will officially resume on May 1st. The rationing method is the same as last time. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has designated more than 370 Southern goods stores to be responsible for the supply, with each person limited to one jin per month. Sugar purchase certificates will be issued to each household by the Bao Tian staff. After the Southern goods stores purchase the sugar, they will settle accounts with the Taiwan Sugar Company based on the purchase certificates. The price of sugar this time is set at 2,100 yuan per jin, and the Taiwan Sugar Company sells it to the Southern goods stores at 1,725 yuan per jin, allowing the Southern goods stores to earn a profit of 375 yuan. The city has a population of 3.5 million people, and 3.5 million jin will be rationed this time.</p>
<h3>Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan Elaborates on the Loan Situation of the Four Joint Offices</h3>
<p>Total Amount Approximately 800 Billion to 1 Trillion Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan made extensive replies to questions raised by various newspapers at a press conference hosted by the United Credit Information Center yesterday. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the types and amounts of loans that have been approved by the Four Joint Offices, Mr. Xu, to the best of his memory, mentioned eleven types and their approximate loan amounts: (1) Loans for state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, approximately 200 billion yuan. (2) Loans for private industrial and mining enterprises, approximately 100 billion yuan. (3) Loans for transportation enterprises, 150 billion yuan. (4) Loans for public utility enterprises, 50 billion yuan. (5) Loans for export trade materials, the total amount is approximately 200 billion yuan. (6) Coal mine loans, the total amount is approximately 20 billion yuan. (7) Grain industry loans, the total amount is approximately 30 billion yuan. (8) Agricultural loans, the total amount is approximately 300 billion yuan or more. (9) Loans for local government finances, the total amount is from 25 billion to 30 billion yuan. (10) Loans for cultural and educational enterprises, the total amount is approximately 30 to 40 billion yuan. (11) Salt loans, the total amount is approximately 200 billion yuan.</p>
<p>(B) The total amount of the various loans mentioned above that have been approved is approximately 800 billion yuan to 1 trillion yuan. Most of the various loans that have been approved and released by the Four Joint Offices in the past have been repaid on time. The only significant bad debt is a loan applied for by the national industrial and commercial circles in the rear after the victory due to the general decline in prices, which has not yet been repaid and has been extended.</p>
<p>(C) One-quarter of the production loans approved last year have now been recovered. It is found that most of these loans are about to mature. The Four Joint Offices stipulate that loans with a term of three months can be extended for one month. Loans with a term of six months cannot be extended again.</p>
<p>(D) A total of more than 1,800 loan applications were approved by the Four Joint Offices last year, and nearly 600 have been approved this year.</p>
<p>(E) The working principles of the Four Joint Offices and the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee do not conflict. The Four Joint Offices are responsible for the allocation of funds for loans issued by various banks and bureaus, while the National Bank Rediscount Committee is responsible for the allocation of funds in the general market. Therefore, the work of the two is complementary and mutually supportive.</p>
<p>(F) The first step in solving the price problem is still to reduce interest rates, and at the same time, speculation should be stopped. If this can be done, the Central Bank can supply sufficient funds to productive enterprises, making productive enterprises more active.</p>

<h3>Shanghai and Hong Kong Tung Oil Export Statistics for the Past Three Months</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that the total amount of tung oil exported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to various parts of the world in January, February, and March of this year has reached 20,168.60 tons (each ton is equal to 2,240 pounds). Among them, the export volume in January was particularly large, and then decreased month by month. It is reported that since the end of March, due to the inverted domestic and foreign market prices of tung oil, it has been impossible to export. The US market price has gradually fallen from 38 cents per pound to less than 30 cents. The normal price is no more than 34 cents at most. Furthermore, the consumption of tung oil in various European and American countries has decreased sharply after the war. Taking the United States as an example, the monthly consumption before the war was 5,000 tons per month, but now it is only 2,500 tons per month. Moreover, after the war, the United States has become accustomed to using tung oil substitutes, which has invisibly reduced the demand for tung oil. However, the monthly amount of tung oil exported to the United States in the three months has been more than 4,000 to 5,000 tons. Therefore, the overseas market price cannot be boosted for a while. The quantities of tung oil exported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to foreign countries in the past three months are listed as follows (unit: ton):</p>
<p>14 tons, Europe a total of 1904 tons, the United Kingdom a total of 2550 tons, and the total amount of exports from Shanghai and Hong Kong to the world in January, February, and March was 20,169 tons.</p>

<h3>Yan'an's "Maginot Line" - Notes from Northern Shaanxi (4)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Qun Hua</p>
<p>Yan'an, 16th Quick Report</p>
<p>Since the breakdown of peace talks, Zhou Enlai hurriedly returned to Yan'an. Mao Zedong convened an enlarged military emergency meeting of cadres. Zhou made a grand speech, shouting "Expand the War of Liberation." The CCP had already issued a general mobilization order and an evacuation order on November 15th of last year, actively preparing for war. The able-bodied men in each county were all formed into teams. Those who were slightly trained and physically strong were either formed into smoke-drying teams or expanded into independent teaching brigades. Those who were older or considered unreliable were formed into self-defense teams, stretcher teams, and transportation teams. The core teams and above were all equipped with better weapons. The self-defense teams and below were equipped with inferior weapons, but it has been achieved to the extent that all able-bodied men have been armed. In addition to being armed, the cadres of the organs were also intensifying air defense education, especially the defense against paratroopers, which was explained and rehearsed practically every day. After early March, the situation became tense, and there was almost no day that they did not go up the mountain to be on air alert, as if facing a formidable enemy. At the same time, they actively increased their troops. Chen Geng, Xiao Jinguang, and other units were successively transferred back from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area. Finally, He Long also moved his troops. In total, they mobilized troops, including militiamen, with a total of three divisions, thirteen brigades, fourteen independent regiments, and ten detachments, totaling more than 160,000 people. They also established a Border Region Defense Mobilization Committee and convened a mass meeting in early March to announce an emergency mobilization, calling for resolutely "Defending Yan'an." All the old and weak were moved to the rear, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government moved to Anzhai, and the CCP Central Committee moved to Wayaobao. The families and food supplies—especially opium—were transported and stored in Bao'an. Their determination to fight with their backs to the city and attempt to lure the National Army deep into the outer areas of Yan'an in order to complete their defense war can be said to have been poured out with all their efforts.</p>
<p>In addition, a widespread policy of clearing the fields and fortifying the walls was implemented. In the area south of Yan'an, all grains and livestock that could be used for the National Army's military needs were moved away. The people were coerced to evacuate, and their furniture and utensils were used by their troops to cook or were converted into stretchers. Therefore, when the National Army first arrived, nine out of ten houses were empty, and the suffering of the people was beyond description. Although this caused difficulties for the National Army, the CCP's failure was doomed here.</p>
<p>Although the rapid recovery of Yan'an was a success of a surprising and decisive strategy of attacking its unpreparedness, the CCP is experienced in mobile warfare. Why could it not turn defeat into victory and lose so miserably? Northern Shaanxi has such favorable geographical conditions, and the CCP is good at internal warfare. If it was just a mistake in military deployment, the CCP could definitely change it quickly after discovering it. Moreover, Mao Zedong and Zhu De had no intention of withdrawing from Northern Shaanxi at all. Instead, they attempted to annihilate the main force of the National Army near Yan'an. However, in the actual development, the CCP lost so badly that it could not stop its feet, and there was not even a single counterattack. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>From the accounts of the people and those who surrendered, we have already discovered that the recapture of Yan'an was two-thirds due to the CCP's own political "mistakes." Military mistakes were only the catalysts.</p>
<p>The CCP has always guided military affairs with politics and determined military strategy and tactics based on political conditions. This time, the erroneous application of strategy and tactics was no exception. Mao Zedong had no doubt in his mind about the loyalty and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses in Northern Shaanxi, whom he had nurtured and taught for thirteen years, and the so-called production troops of the 120th Division, the 358th Brigade, and the 359th Brigade, whom he regarded as confidants. He firmly believed that, based on these estimates, in politics, he could definitely ensure that the National Army's attack on Yan'an, like the previous encirclement and suppression in Jiangxi, would encounter enemies everywhere, be ambushed everywhere, and eventually be destroyed under the joint counterattack of the so-called revolutionary soldiers and civilians. Surrender, non-resistance, and collapse would never happen. The National Army would not know the situation of the defense lines and remote dangerous areas. Therefore, when they withdrew from Yan'an, they did not destroy anything. They firmly believed that Yan'an would never be lost, or even if it was temporarily lost, it would be recovered quickly. Therefore, they had a plan to lure the "enemy" deep and attempt to annihilate the National Army near Yan'an. But they were completely wrong.</p>
<p>Under their opium economic policy, the cadres became rich and became confused about the revolution. How could those old cadres from peasant backgrounds have the same experience and insight as Mao Zedong? What did they get after more than ten years of arduous struggle? So they boldly embezzled and had some secret money—opium and gold. They wavered, but could not decisively break off organizational ties. Thus, they were contradictory and hesitant, and their encirclement, surrender, and capture were doomed. This time, the 358th and 359th Brigades, the production troops specializing in planting opium, had a particularly large number of captives and lost particularly miserably—Zhu De cried loudly because of this—which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>What about the people? They naturally cannot recognize the planting of opium as revolutionary production, and they are very disgusted with its occupation of land and failure to produce staple foods. Although some people have gained some benefits from fighting landlords and seizing grain and giving land to people (conscription), they have to pay a life, make countless enemies, and do countless things against their conscience. The conservative peasants always have an unspeakable contradiction in their hearts.</p>
<p>In addition, unconditional pro-Soviet and anti-Americanism, forcibly linking anti-Americanism and pro-Sovietism with patriotism, equating the separatist "mountain king" practice with "democracy," mixing war and peace together, and pinning hopes for victory on unreliable Soviet aid are also the most doubtful things for its cadres and the masses, which directly and indirectly affect its combat effectiveness and the intensity of mobilization.</p>
<p>This time, the main forces of the Communist Army's 358th and 359th Brigades were completely destroyed, and the number of prisoners reached more than 13,000. The entire military was inevitably panic-stricken, so the National Army took advantage of the victory and advanced, invincible. Of course, without the heroic struggle of the National Army soldiers, without the ingenious strategy of Chief Hu and Chief of Staff Sheng, and the resolute advance through dangerous terrain, unexpectedly, to the area between the Yichuan-Yanhe and Luochuan-Yan'an lines, encircling and annihilating the Maginot Line of Da and Xiao Laushan, it would not have been possible.</p>
<p>To be honest, the retreat was planned, but the abandonment was not. That is to say, Mao Zedong and his colleagues had no intention of fundamentally withdrawing from Northern Shaanxi. The retreat was only one of the combat procedures to avoid bombing losses and lure the "enemy" deep. It only showed their determination to use Yan'an as a pocket and prepare to launch a fierce annihilation war near Yan'an.</p>
<p>This is a strange and thought-provoking thing: except for the library behind the central auditorium of Yangjialing, the rest of the buildings in Yan'an were not damaged at all. The residences, beds, tables, screens, sofas, and cabinets of Mao Zedong and other important CCP figures were not moved away. Only the bedding on the beds, the springs and covers on the sofas, the lining cloth on the screens, and the books on the bookshelves were taken away. Why didn't Yan'an clear the fields and fortify the walls? Was it left for General Hu Zongnan to enjoy, to curry favor? There is no better explanation than the hurried retreat.</p>
<p>The offensive and defensive battle of Yan'an was first started by the CCP. Most of the CCP troops that started the battle were transferred back from the Shanxi-Suiyuan area. Since they were prepared to retreat, why did they have to transfer them from thousands of miles away? Furthermore, the strategic position of the Northern Shaanxi area is extremely important. General Hu Zongnan's hundreds of thousands of troops have been constrained by it for many years. In terms of geographical situation, it is "easy to attack and easy to defend" and it is a barrier to Shanxi. Mao Zedong would never be so stupid as to present this "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" with great strategic significance with both hands and let Hu Zongnan bite himself. Why was he chased so badly that he couldn't stop himself, and even took away valuable and necessary things such as broadcasting stations, printing presses, and printing types? And why didn't the arsenal in Bao'an move away in advance? Is this what a planned abandonment and retreat looks like?</p>
<p>He Long and his chief of staff issued the Zuo Zi No. 14 circular, instructing the Communist Army to defend Yan'an to the death, which is an indisputable fact. In the Battle of Da and Xiao Laushan, four regiments of the Communist Army were annihilated, which also shows their desperate fight. Mao Zedong did not retreat until the 17th, and Zhu De tearfully went north a few hours before the fall of Yan'an. All of these prove that the so-called planned abandonment of Yan'an is not the case, but being beaten to the point of fleeing in panic is 100% true.</p>

<h3>Chief Executive Chen Yi's Farewell to Reporters</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Taiwan, 23rd Dispatch</p>
<p>At the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on April 22nd, it was decided that Chief Executive Chen Yi would leave Taiwan, relinquishing the position of the first chief executive after its restoration.</p>
<p>The reporters enthusiastically suggested to the two directors of the newsroom, Zhang Yanzhe and Shen Yunlong, that the Chief Executive should grant the reporters a conversation. They gladly agreed to forward the request, and thus our "farewell conversation" with Chief Executive Chen Yi was arranged.</p>
<p>Implementing New Policies, Powerful Reactionary Forces</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. on the 24th, the figure of an old man with auburn-colored suit, temples gray, and face flushed appeared at the Taipei Guest House. He still walked with vigor, greeting the reporters with gleaming eyes. He nodded, saying that the exchange rate of 40 New Taiwan Dollars to 1 Old Taiwan Dollar had been decided, a result he had obtained with great difficulty from the central government.</p>
<p>The reporters were eager to hear his reflections on his year and a half governing Taiwan. He said, "Objectively speaking, many things have not been accomplished. There are many reasons for this, due to environmental factors, which are not easy to discuss now."</p>
<p>With deep-seated pain, he cited historical facts to illustrate the growth of reactionary forces. He listed examples from the Qin, Han, and Song dynasties, noting that the implementation of new policies invariably encountered strong opposition. Although these new policies eventually succeeded. He pointed out that three types of people are targeted: first, progressive figures who strive to change the environment; second, bad people and treacherous officials; and third, the majority who are neither good nor bad, silent, writing beautiful articles and saying beautiful things. These people have been insignificant in the historical tradition of the past two thousand years because of the cyclical nature of history. However, this is no longer acceptable today; we need leniency and progress. He further used England as an example to illustrate the power of the majority of the people, while the Soviet government can control its population. In China, a policy that benefits the majority of the people may not necessarily gain their support. However, when it conflicts with the interests of a small number of special classes of landlords and gentry, the power of these reactionary forces is considerable, and it is impossible to prevent them. Therefore, he firmly believes that progress requires fearlessness of suspicion and jealousy, cultivating a spirit of fearlessness of sacrifice, and the support of public opinion.</p>
<p>Two New Tasks, Willing to Dedicate to the New Chairman</p>
<p>The Chief Executive had ideals and aspirations for governing Taiwan and expressed satisfaction with the work that the cadres should do. The provincial finance suffered a deficit last year, but a large asset was left behind. The new chairman need not worry about finance. Regarding public enterprises, monopolies, and trade, he simply said, "If we don't do it, the finance will be terrible, factories won't be smoking, schools won't be open, and over six hundred water conservancy projects cannot be done, and the people's taxes will not be bearable." He did not elaborate on the external criticism of "tight economic control and loose political control," stating his dilemma as "it looks tight, but it really can't not be done."</p>
<p>Two things were planned for the second half of the year in his governance plan for Taiwan. First, of the 106,000 people returning from overseas and the mainland, half are unemployed, and he was determined to give them engineering team status to engage in construction work. Second, for children who are out of school, give them the skills to make a living. He advocated nine years of compulsory education, three years equivalent to junior high school level, and after graduation, they can find jobs in various professional sectors. This plan was obviously thwarted, but he is willing to dedicate it to the new chairman for implementation.</p>
<p>He also frankly stated that dealing with the pro-Japanese gentry, members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, bad ruffians, and smuggling is impossible. China has no laws that can serve as the basis for strict punishment or banishment to Green Island. Sending them to court would result in a detention of two or three months at most, and then they would be released. This kind of jurisprudence that does not fit the facts only forces everyone not to do things seriously. It is difficult to demand progress and political reform in this environment.</p>
<p>Regarding the Press, Self-Recognized Old Habits</p>
<p>The most concerned reporters at the meeting were their own personal matters. The Chief Executive emphasized: he believes in freedom, and for a year and a half, he has supported the freedom of speech, assembly, and publication. He talked about freedom, and as a result, the 228 incident occurred. This kind of detached freedom should be changed and compensated as soon as possible. He attaches importance to the press, and the press should also respect itself. He further affirmed that it is difficult to assign a propaganda agency to take sole responsibility for the overall propaganda task. It is necessary for everyone to cooperate, pay attention to many aspects, concentrate on doing it on a large scale, do more construction work, not harbor leadership desires, and serve everyone.</p>
<p>Director Ye of the Central News Agency, based on the Chief Executive's attitude towards the press when he governed Fujian, asked him to recall what he said when he came to Taiwan, "Try to adopt it according to the situation," and re-examine it. He said, "I made the old mistake." Then: "In Fujian at that time, many people could not understand me, but after I left, they missed me. This is not a gain or loss for individuals or groups, but a loss for the country."</p>
<p>In his vision, he firmly believes that the future of Taiwan, this Chinese territory, is bright. He loves Taiwan and cares for the vast majority of kind Taiwanese compatriots. Public opinion should give spiritual comfort to those who are hard-working researchers and experimenters. Blindly accusing corruption only increases uneasiness. Throughout his life, he is not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of grievances, and does not know discouragement. This time leaving Taiwan, his active spirit is the same as when he came.</p>
<p>Chief Executive's Office, Will Become a Historical Relic</p>
<p>At the same time, after the Chief Executive and the reporters finished taking pictures in front of this newspaper's camera, they shook hands and said goodbye one by one. We watched his resolute, calm, wise, and solid back leaving in the pouring rain. Everyone is anticipating the disappearance of the "Chief Executive's Office" and the title of "Chief Executive" in one or two weeks when the new Provincial Chairman arrives. Chief Executive Chen Yi will also temporarily leave Taiwan at this time.</p>
<p>Will the Chief Executive's face and style give people memories and love like when he governed Fujian? Will the fact of governing Hebei for a year and a half be used as the main evaluation in his political life? Is the economic policy that he insisted on implementing a success or a failure? And is the 228 incident the fault of him and his cadres alone? ... In these questions, the answer that the reporter can get is that in the current situation of political turmoil and the country's failure to achieve unity, an administrative worker with ideals who is diligent, self-motivated, and loyal to the nation, when implementing policies that benefit the majority of people, is first sacrificed because he cannot prevent the waves of reactionary forces and cannot win the support of the majority of people. The price is: giving later comers and the country a severe lesson.</p>
<p>Obviously, in his bloody and tearful conversation, his pain is greater than the feelings he expressed. The reporters will watch Chief Executive Chen Yi leave in a hurry, and will also welcome the arrival of the new chairman with new aspirations. It is truly full of emotion, regret, and hope!</p>
<p>The Chief Executive's Office, the political hub of Taiwan Province, will soon be changed to the Provincial Government. (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)</p>

<h3>Please Round Off Fares for City Transportation</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: The sections of Yichang Road and West Suzhou Road are densely packed with factories, and the traffic is important. However, the roads are damaged and uneven. After it rains, puddles form, and mud splashes everywhere, making it unbearable. In the past, there were Route 19 and Route 21 trolleybuses running between Sanyangjing Bridge and the Mint Bridge at the bottom of Gordon Road. After the Japanese invaders occupied the concession, they dismantled the electric wires in order to collect materials. More than a year and a half has passed since the restoration, but the tram company has not yet restored the lines. Currently, to catch a bus, one must go to the intersection of Changshou Road and Jiangning Road or the Big Bell, which is a hardship for residents and workers traveling back and forth. Therefore, I request the municipal authorities to repair the roads as soon as possible and order the British tram company to find a way to restore the lines or add public buses to facilitate transportation, which would be a great convenience. (Lu Jingqing)</p>
<p>Another Letter: At the intersection of Wusong Road and Qiujiang Road, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company repaired water pipes a few days ago. The stone road surface was damaged and has not been restored. Passing vehicles are often in danger of overturning. I implore the wise authorities to send personnel to survey and repair it as soon as possible to benefit the people's travel. (Du Lian)</p>
<h3>Please Prohibit Stalls in Front of Schools</h3>
<p>The hardship of hawker life is well known, especially the great uproar caused by the authorities' crackdown last year, which won the sympathy of the public. However, the location of hawker stalls should be in appropriate places that do not hinder the scenery. If stalls are set up in front of schools, it is not only an inappropriate place but also detrimental to the scenery. The reasons are summarized below:</p>
<p>Schools are institutions for education and should not encourage students to develop wasteful habits. Some schools do not have strict access control, and students can enter and exit freely. If there are snack stalls in front of the school, it is tantamount to encouraging students to waste money and buy unsanitary snacks, which is contrary to the purpose of education. Moreover, some bad stalls even contain the meaning of gambling. The students all gather around these stalls after class, betting their money on them. During class, they have no intention of listening to lectures, and their minds are only on these stalls, which is harmful to the students. I have personally experienced it, so I know the details very well. If foreign guests visit the school and see stalls in front of the school, it will also be detrimental to the scenery. Therefore, I deeply hope that the police will strictly prohibit stalls from setting up stalls in front of schools and hope that the school authorities will prohibit students from entering and leaving freely during class time to emphasize the school spirit and cultivate good and thrifty habits for students. (Zhang Zongli)</p>
<h3>Attention Should Be Paid to Beggars on the Streets</h3>
<p>Recently, a large number of "beggars" have been discovered in this city, mostly adults and children, with northern accents. In groups of three or two, they carry monkeys and play suonas and bamboo flutes, begging from door to door. As one group leaves, another group arrives within twenty minutes, flowing incessantly and scattered on various streets. In the past, beggars were only seen in the vicinity of the Red Temple, except in the Nanjing Road and Bund Huangpu areas. However, this has changed in the past two months. These beggars push open the doors of large businesses and offices in the Nanjing Road and Bund areas, begging while playing instruments, ignoring the scenery and public order. I hope the authorities will pay attention to this. (Huang Haitao)</p>
<h3>Rescue Out-of-School Children in Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: When Yue was occupied, the enemy and puppets were extremely violent. After the victory, the entire countryside was like withered grass and trees, and its vitality could not be restored for a while. Speaking of education, there is no way to raise funds first. Although the county government stipulates that each Bao should run a primary school, it is equivalent to a mere formality. Even if some are reluctantly set up, most parents cannot afford tuition fees or buy books, allowing their children to waste their studies.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that children are the masters of the next generation, and both the country and the family place a hope on them. To achieve this hope, they must be educated. Now, many, many school-age children in Shaoxing are unable to receive education due to economic reasons. How will they be able to assume the responsibility of the master of the country in the future? Therefore, I am writing this letter hoping that social elites will initiate and raise some funds to run several compulsory primary schools in rural areas. This will benefit the children of Yue, which will also benefit the future society and the country. (He Zhongmou)</p>

<h3>Gao Bridge</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>Ascend that Northern Mound, alas! Gaze upon the Imperial Capital, alas! The palaces are magnificent, alas! The toils of the people, alas! Boundless and endless, alas!</p>
<p>This is Liang Hong's Lament Poem, a superlative piece of writing unmatched in ancient and modern times, a kind of bone-chilling, desolate long sigh. At that time, Liang Hong went east out of the pass, passed through Luoyang, and wrote this poem. "Emperor Suzong—Emperor Zhang of the Later Han—heard it and was saddened, but could not find Hong." Because Liang Hong and his wife, Meng Guang, were already pushing a small cart southward along the old route of Taibo and Yu Zhong, and had arrived in Suzhou. After arriving in Suzhou, he lived at Gao Bridge, which was Gao Botong's house. This couple, giving their labor for free, "rented spring," residing under the eaves of the Gao family. In this way, where could Emperor Zhang find him? And I don't know how long it took. Because this couple respected each other as guests, and Meng Guang raised the tray to her forehead. One day, Gao Botong saw it and was shocked, thinking that they must not be ordinary people. After inquiring, he understood the situation and showed great respect. The place name Gao Bridge has been passed down to this day.</p>
<p>Raising the tray to the forehead is a very famous incident. The tray is a food container. When bringing food, one does not casually put it down, but solemnly places it, as if in front of honored guests. This is the original meaning of raising the tray to the forehead. Because it is usually written as "desk," it is misunderstood as the Eight Immortals table. Thus, Meng Guang is made to be incredibly strong, able to lift the table with one hand. However, this joke has been around since ancient times and has long become history.</p>
<p>Entering the city from the Chang Gate, heading east along the road for less than half a kilometer, there is a cement flat bridge. Crossing the bridge is the bus stop. There are electrical shops and fruit shops at the head of the bridge. The form is exactly the most common thing in modern cities, but it is the trace of hermits and poets of 1900 years ago. That is Gao Bridge. Suzhou is the only city in the country that preserves ancient place names. Such as Feng Dou, Xu Gate, Yao Li Fang, Tiger Hill, etc., dating back to 2,500 years. Gao Bridge is not the oldest, of course it has long been unrecognizable now. However, didn't Kong Rong say, "Although there are no old people, there are still models." Didn't the Grand Historian say, "High mountains are looked up to, and great conduct is followed. Although one cannot reach it, one's heart yearns for it." Leaving a few place names, can't it still make future generations look up to, admire, and yearn for it? Does it not give rise to endless imagination?</p>
<p>Gao Bridge is located on West Chang Gate Street. Walking to the end of this small street is the west entrance of Peach Blossom Dock. The area of West Chang Gate Street is a vegetable market in the morning. I take a vegetable basket to the vicinity of Gao Bridge almost half of the days, and I often walk across the bridge. I used to hear people say it was High Bridge and didn't pay much attention to it. Recently, I learned that it was Gao Bridge, which shows how little I read. Afterwards, thinking about it, in Yu Xin's Lament for the South, the two lines "Drifting at the Lower Pavilion, traveling at the High Bridge" are written as "High" Bridge. After that, when I passed the bridge again, I had a different feeling. On the cement railing bridge, cars were driving, and radio receivers were constantly blasting vulgar songs. Underneath is a dirty, stagnant water. In this place, 1900 years ago, a great hermit lived his life, using his life to express an extremely lofty ideal. This kind of behavior, on the surface, seems to be passive, but it has created an unparalleled influence on our culture.</p>
<p>At the time of Emperor Zhang, the Later Han Dynasty was at its peak, Ban Chao was demonstrating his power in the Western Regions, and the politics were still clean. However, historians saw that some bad trends had already been created at that time. Did Liang Hong's Five Litanies come from political foresight, or from a different kind of fundamental insight? The latter seems closer to reality. The tone of this poem is quite subtle, not as激昂 as Jia Yi and Liu Xiang's memorials. However, the emotion is very sad, especially the first and last two sentences. What is Northern Mound? It is the place where high officials and dignitaries have been buried since ancient times. Today, the soldiers are enjoying the magnificent palaces, but perhaps tomorrow they will go to the Northern Mound to be with the dead. And the people's toil does not disappear, but continues from generation to generation. Emperor Zhang was ultimately wise, and "heard it and was saddened."</p>
<p>But emperors and hermits are ultimately in two completely different worlds. Even if his heart beat once, he could not change it. Liang Hong also knew this, so he left quietly, expressing his ideals through action. Therefore, this poem is not only an accusation against politics, but a fundamental opposition to politics. If there is an imperial capital, it cannot but create magnificent palaces, and it cannot but oppress the people and seize their possessions. The people's toil will never end. Then the meaning of this poem is equal to the Western Mountain Song of Boyi, and even more fierce and thorough than Jia and Liu.</p>
<p>Hermitage is a special and great ideal in our country's politics. Figures like Xu You and Wu Guang are difficult to verify, but Boyi and Shuqi are clearly彰彩 and prominent. "Using violence to replace violence, without knowing it is wrong" is a thorough opposition to politics. Regardless of the violence of Jie and Zhou, or the benevolence of Tang and Wu, once politics is involved, it is all the same thing. What is called using extreme benevolence to attack extreme unbenevolence is still a case of violence in the eyes of Yi and Qi, judged by another higher standard. After this, figures like the Hoeing Old Man, Holding the Whip and Watering the Garden, the Madman of Chu Jie Yu, and Chang Ju Jie Ni, even Confucius could not disparage them. He only lamented: "If the world were orderly, I would not change places with you."</p>
<p>I don't know if politics is ultimately the highest realm of mankind. As Aristotle said, man is a political animal. Perhaps this is just a transitional method. Mankind may eventually reach a realm where politics is not needed at all. This is too big a problem to discuss at present. The current fact is: we cannot leave politics, and politics often has shortcomings, even creating evils. Looking at history, it is really impossible to settle the account of whether politics can offset its merits and demerits. Therefore, our country has produced two great political ideals. One is not to disturb the people, the so-called simple government and clear punishment, loose net and wide meshes, reducing the scope of politics. Confucius's theory of "guiding them with virtue and aligning them with rituals" also limits political activities. The other is the idea of hermitage, denying the supreme importance of politics. To use a not-so-accurate metaphor, it is like Stimson's non-recognition doctrine. No matter how轟轟烈烈 you make a fuss, I will ignore it. Even if you succeed, I will always recognize it as violence, then that kind of success will not get a solid foundation and will always be temporary. It seems like this is passive, but it fundamentally destroys the opponent's foundation.</p>
<p>Because of this, our country did not have absolute autocracy until the Yuan Dynasty, when foreign races ruled. The existence of hermitage caused the emperor to lose his supreme position and only obtain a relative position. Nineteen hundred years ago, in the remote and desolate Jiangnan, there were two laborers living in other people's miscellaneous courtyards (people without their own houses at that time were equal to people without houses living on the streets today), earning a living by sweating on their foreheads. But their status was equal to that of the emperor, and their power was equal to that of the emperor. With these kinds of people, the ancient emperors of our country did not dare to do whatever they wanted. People in politics also did not take serving the emperor as their greatest goal. Not serving kings and lords is not only a kind of personal highness. It is a thorough resistance and accusation.</p>
<p>However, in the present day, 1900 years later, the place name Gao Bridge may only have meaning for people who are hurrying on and off buses. Every day, the vehicles on the bridge and the water under the bridge flow separately, and no one will have any associations with such an ordinary white bridge? At this time, perhaps only a few people will not have more or less dissatisfaction with politics. Then, should we, people of this era, learn from Confucius, who thought, "Birds and beasts cannot be associated with, who should I associate with if not with these people?" Therefore, regardless of whether this world is good or bad, we must share a part of the responsibility and share a part of the rights? Or, follow in the footsteps of hermits, resolutely give up all enjoyment and make a thorough accusation? This is to be decided by each person and cannot be forced. But one thing is certain: that is, since you choose to share the enjoyment, you should bear a part of the responsibility, but you cannot just take the enjoyment and then stand aside and say sarcastic remarks.</p>
<p>I take a vegetable basket near Gao Bridge almost half of the days. Whenever I carry a full basket of mustard greens, bamboo shoots, yellow croaker, salted mackerel, etc., and feel that my arm is a little tired, I think that Liang Hong would probably laugh at me. I live in Peach Blossom Dock, but I have neither the talent of Tang Bohu nor his financial resources, so I dare not be unrestrained and romantic. Nor do I have the strength of Liang Hong to earn a living by sweating on my forehead. Therefore, I dare not regard myself as a hermit and must live among the people. Thinking of the words "fearing the head and fearing the tail, the body has little left," I can't help but laugh. Therefore, I don't dare to complain. Only when I occasionally have free time and put down my pen and paper, I can't help but chant the Five Litanies in a long voice and cherish distant reveries.</p>

<h3>The Sequel Writer of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea"</h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>Although the famous novel "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" by Zeng Mengpu, known as the Sick Man of East Asia, was never completed by himself, there had already been two versions made to continue it. According to the "History of Late Qing Dynasty Novels," these were: "One by Lu Shi'e, 'New Flower in a Sinful Sea' (published by the Reformed Novel Society, 1910), and one by Bao Tianxiao, 'Green Blood and Evening Mist' (published in 'Novel Forest'). One was not named, and one was unfinished." Now, there is another "Sequel to A Flower in a Sinful Sea," which was written by Yan Gu Laoren after he fled from his hometown of Changshu to Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>In fact, I have said that the first sequel writer of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" was none other than the Sick Man of East Asia himself. This is because he said in the preface to the revised edition that the book's creator was "Lover of Freedom" Jin Songcen, and that the first four or five chapters were originally drafted by Jin. As for the Sick Man of East Asia, although he engaged in writing for more than twenty years, in the end, according to his original plan and the complete list of sixty chapters he had drawn up, he only wrote half, and the rest was buried with his death. It is also a pity that "Lover of Freedom" has now passed away, twelve years after the death of the Sick Man of East Asia, and he never wrote a sequel. The sequel writer is Yan Gu Laoren, Zhang Yin'nan.</p>
<p>As for Yan Gu Laoren's sequel, what is it like? Does it continue the unfinished part according to the original plan of the Sick Man of East Asia? Because I have not yet seen his work, I cannot say for sure. Now, I just want to briefly describe this Yan Gu Laoren, who can be said to be qualified to be the sequel writer of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea."</p>
<p>Yan Gu Laoren is also a respected Confucian scholar from Changshu, named Zhang Hong, with the courtesy name Yin'nan. He was about the same age as the Sick Man of East Asia and a childhood friend. In their later years, they lived in the same city, visiting each other from time to time, composing and singing poems together. Zhang's residence, Yan Gu Garden, and Zeng's residence, Xu Wu Ju, both had the beauty of springs, rocks, flowers, and trees. Needless to say, Zhang was very familiar with the characters and stories in "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," and even participated in the writing plan.</p>
<p>In the year before the death of the Sick Man of East Asia, in the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), because the five southeastern provinces held a transportation exhibition, Changshu County was also included in the scenic area, and he was ordered to organize famous scenic spots and ancient sites. At that time, the county magistrate of the county, Zhou Heng, summoned local gentry after receiving the order, and then proceeded. It was decided to organize the Changshu County Organizing Committee for Scenic Spots, and Zhou County Magistrate was appointed as the chairman (Zhou resigned, and Huan Ji succeeded as county magistrate), Zhang Yin'nan was the vice chairman, and Zhang was also recommended as one of the editors of the tourist guide. This shows his reputation in the local area.</p>
<p>Let me also mention a few examples of Yan Gu Laoren's poems and essays, to get a glimpse. At that time, the "Yushan Tourist Guide" was edited by Pan Jiason, and he also wrote two quatrains for it:</p>
<p>"The ten-mile Yushan has a fresh look, the forests and springs are pointed out by a clear talent; the lofty sentiment is no different from Hanshan, the couple searched meticulously and picked stones."</p>
<p>"The mountain light of Yuling is like a mat, and the waves of Shanghu are as white as silver; it is a pity that such a good secluded place may be invaded by vile people."</p>
<p>His essay, such as the "Inscription for the Huan Cui Small Abode," I went to Changshu with friends last May after the war to visit the park, and rested in the Huan Cui Small Abode, and saw that its wood carvings were still well preserved. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Yushan is beautiful, and there is a park in it, close to the steep blue, embracing the green of the forest, the setting sun sends the rosy clouds, and a slight sound is heard; the morning sun fans the harmony, and from time to time the fragrance of grass is teased. There are two or three people, next to the towering oaks, sparse shade through the smoke, the empty window stores the moon, leaning on the railing to offer the flute, and the Oriole's charming voice harmonizes; playing chess, competing with the ants for the road. Occupying the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains, providing friends with clear talk, initiating a good name, inscribed on the plaque, saying: Huan Cui Small Abode, entrusting me with a note to leave fingerprints. Not relying on the remnants of the past, but borrowing the eternal fragrant box, just to stay the elders, and to wave their words."</p>
<p>In the past, Lu Shi'e and Bao Tianxiao, who wrote sequels to "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," were also famous novelists. The "History of Late Qing Dynasty Novels" also has records of their works.</p>

<h3>Talking About Local Opera</h3>
<p>— Dong Meikan</p>
<p>Kunqu Opera ascended to the hall of high culture during the Qing Dynasty and could not enter the so-called vulgar ear. However, all true art should be understood and accepted by the public. Kunqu Opera had already moved away from this basic condition, and its fate was thus decided. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the so-called local operas of various regions rose up to seize the position of Kunqu Opera. At this time, people called Kunqu Opera the "elegant troupe," and all others were classified as "flower troupes." Those wealthy salt merchants hired actors from both troupes to provide entertainment at any time. For example, the "Record of Pleasure Boats in Yangzhou" records:</p>
<p>"The salt affairs of Lianghuai always kept both flower and elegant troupes to prepare for grand operas. The elegant troupe is Kunqu Opera; the flower troupe is Beijing Opera, Qin Opera, Yiyang Opera, Bangzi Opera, Luoluo Opera, and Erhuang Tune, collectively called Luan Tan."</p>
<p>The various tunes of the flower troupe were not actually newly created. Some tunes, such as Yiyang Opera, were popular before Kunqu Opera came into being. During the period of silence, one branch was preserved in the north, and it became Gaoqiang Opera based in Gaoyang, Zhili. There are also other tunes that existed as early as the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Qu Lu: "In recent decades, there have been various tunes from Yiyang, Yidao, Qingyang, Leping, and Huizhou."</p>
<p>Wei Liangfu's words are sufficient to prove this. Of course, the so-called rise of the flower troupe was initially dominated by Qin Opera, Luoluo Tune, and Yiyang Opera. The preface to the "Legend of the Dream in the Dream," which came out in the early Qianlong period, says:</p>
<p>"The pear orchard in Chang'an (referring to the capital) is said to be prosperous… and what they like is only the sound of the Qin Opera, Luoluo Tune, and Yiyang Tune, and they hate listening to Wu Sao (referring to Kunqu Opera). When they hear Kunqu Opera, they disperse in a commotion."</p>
<p>These words prove the fact that the public at that time disliked the "elegant troupe" and liked the "flower troupe." The emperor's feet were mostly nobles and scholar-officials. It had reached this point, and other places must inevitably love the various tunes of the flower troupe, especially the actors from Huizhou in the south. Although there were other operas in the Huizhou troupe, they were mainly Huizhou tunes. Emperor Gaozong of Qing had listened to the various tunes of the flower troupe in the south during his southern tours, and was generally satisfied. In the 55th year of Qianlong (1790), the Huizhou troupe also entered Beijing.</p>
<p>"Dreamy Gossip Records": "Sanqing… In the gengxu year of the 55th year of Qianlong, Gaozong's 80th birthday, they entered the capital to celebrate. At that time, they were called the Sanqing Huizhou troupe, which was the ancestor of the Huizhou troupes."</p>
<p>This celebration was just an excuse to take the opportunity. In fact, they knew that the emperor liked their performances, so they developed to the capital and flourished in a short period of time. By the Jiaqing period, five troupes had been established, including Sanqing, Sixi, Hechun, Chuntai, and Sanhe. Of course, although the names were Huizhou troupes, the actors were not necessarily all from Huizhou. They were from all over the place. In terms of tunes, they changed after arriving in the capital, absorbing the strengths of various tunes. Everyone also learned other tunes such as Beijing Opera, Qin Opera, and Kunqu Opera. Among these five troupes, the four major troupes were the most famous, and each had its own characteristics. According to the "Records of Residual Tears in Jintai," they were roughly:</p>
<p>"Sixi" was called "Quzi" because it originally specialized in Kunqu Opera.</p>
<p>"Sanqing" was called "Zhouzi" and specialized in performing newly arranged contemporary events and continuous operas.</p>
<p>"Hechun" was called "Bazi" and specialized in performing martial arts operas such as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the Water Margin.</p>
<p>"Chuntai" was called "Haizi" because it was a children's troupe.</p>
<p>At that time, in addition to performing in halls, the troupes also performed in theaters. It is said that "theaters that perform operas must hire a Huizhou troupe. The larger theaters such as Guangdelou, Guanghelou, Qingleyuan, and Sanqingwei must also be dominated by Huizhou troupes. After this, the Huizhou troupe, the small troupe, and the Western troupe are mixed and suitable."</p>
<p>The fact that these dramas could flourish in the Qing Dynasty naturally had its reasons: First, Emperor Gaozong repeatedly toured the south to investigate the people's sentiments, and he obtained methods of governance—combining leniency and strictness; not only drama, but also the period of brilliant literature was created. Second, as commercial capital became more developed, the number of people in the city who needed entertainment increased. Third, because of the changes in the scholar-official class, psychological development, the actors used the power and money of the scholar-officials, and the scholar-officials played with the actors' beauty. Fourth, because it is human nature to like the new and dislike the old, and the old tunes can no longer entertain people's ears and eyes. The various tunes of the flower troupe flourished for these four reasons, but the value of dramatic art was also lowered as a result.</p>
<p>Until the Xianfeng period, Cheng Changgeng, a native of Anhui, emerged from the Huizhou troupe. Not only was his art superior to his peers, but he was also capable in administration. The good troupe rules of the old troupe were almost all established by him. He was the "big boss" of the Pihuang Opera world, specializing in old male roles, and his singing and acting skills were unmatched at the time. Only Zhang Erkui and Yu Sansheng, who were equally famous as him, stood shoulder to shoulder with him. However, from Qianlong to Daoguang, they were all praised and mocked. Since Changgeng's emergence, he has reversed the evil trend, and this achievement should not be erased. After him, there was Tan Xinpei, who was also a worthy actor. However, the hearts of the petty bourgeoisie for art are not as good as their lust for women. Later, they still mocked and mocked.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 409</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Birds of a feather flock together, and people gather in groups." Usually, if you want to determine what kind of group a group of people is, whether it is positive, evil, good, bad, ambitious, or decadent, you only need to first listen to their words and then observe each person's attitude and actions, like a qualitative analysis in chemistry, you can at least determine 90% of it. This is to say that it is somewhat inappropriate for the place and time, otherwise it can simply determine 100% of it.</p>
<p>In this group, in terms of age, Li Ming is the eldest, but he is only on the edge of thirty years old. The next is Shouyi, who is exactly twenty-eight years old; then there are Tsurumi and Masa'iwa, both of whom are twenty-six or seven. The youngest is the Korean patriot, who is said to be only twenty-one years old.</p>
<p>Speaking of physique and appearance, Shouyi is the best among the five. It is said that when he was studying in Japan, Japanese women rushed to call him "Beautiful Male God." Among the five, he is also the tallest, about five feet nine inches, standing among ordinary Westerners, and when it comes to physique, no one dares to add the words short and thin to him. Although his figure is so tall, his entire physique has developed so evenly, and it matches the height of his body very well; southern people laugh at thin and long people as "electric wooden poles," and northern Shandong people laugh at flat cake-like "iron towers" and "burly men," etc., but these adjectives cannot be used to describe him. He has that appropriately ideal standard physique.</p>
<p>Speaking of martial arts; in the old style, he is the most proud disciple of Old Man Juechang, and since he started practicing at the age of five or six, he has been on the right track; he has practiced both internal and external skills of Yoben, boxing mothers, and has also practiced Dharma Palm, Toad Gong, Snatching, and the small tricks of dislocating bones and dividing tendons from experts. As for modern Western boxing, fencing, racing, throwing, and throwing, they are just child's play to him. As for shooting, he practiced to the point where he could "hit the target every time," not only without aiming, but also without visual effort. In terms of education, he has a first-class electrical engineering degree from Japan, and two years of practical experience in a radio factory. Because all his qualities are good, and he is naturally gentle, his words and actions are beautiful, and he is so elegant and calm.</p>
<p>As for this young patriot from Korea, he is also well-proportioned and handsome and sturdy. I use the word handsome because he really looks like a delicate woman. However, it is said that his character is more violent than a bomb, and at the same time, he is also proficient in espionage skills. All his actions are mostly simple and honest like most Koreans.</p>
<p>(Here, the author never mentioned the name of this Korean patriot, which is very regrettable; but there are two reasons: First, when Tsurumi narrated the characters of this gathering to me that day, he did not mention the name, and I neglected to ask. Although I want to ask him now, he has run to such a barren place, and he is so decadent, even if I write to ask, I am afraid there will be no result.</p>
<p>Second, after arriving in Shanghai, I met two Korean classmates who were also former Korean revolutionary comrades. I once inquired from them about the name of this young man. It is said that there were several people of the same age and appearance as this young comrade, but one by one, they bled and sacrificed in the underground work during the fall of Shanghai. Some were named Kim, some were named Min, some…etc. The old revolutionary leader on that day had already died of illness, and it was even more impossible to ask about it.)</p>
<h3>Dickens' Speech</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>Once, the famous British novelist Dickens gave a speech in Manchester, vigorously attacking the "A Little Learning is Dangerous" theory that was prevalent in society at that time.</p>
<p>He said loudly: "Although houses and land cannot be given to them, knowledge can still give something besides houses and land."</p>
<h3>Elizabeth's Hand</h3>
<p>— Youjin</p>
<p>The birthday of Princess Elizabeth, the heir to the British throne, is April 21. She is only 21 years old this year. When the UK held a grand coming-of-age celebration, she broadcast her most beautiful speech to the nation.</p>
<p>This 21-year-old future queen not only has a mouth that can give speeches, but also has hands that can work. After all, times have changed. She no longer prides herself on her noble and jade-like hands, like the ancient Chinese poets who praised the hands of those aristocratic women, saying something like "hands like soft reeds, skin like solidified fat."</p>
<p>What are her hands like? According to a feature article in the report:</p>
<p>"…She sleeps in the palace at night and works in oil and machines during the day. She likes to get her nails dirty and her hands covered in oil, showing off the achievements of her labor to her friends…."</p>
<p>Although this is somewhat close to self-promotion and showing off, her knowledge is correct. When Martin Attlee (the son of British Prime Minister Attlee) stretched out a dirty hand after wiping the floor on a seagoing vessel on the Bund of Shanghai and shook hands with a Chinese reporter, he said; "My hand is too victorious!" These two things clearly have the flavor of mutual reflection. One is the son of the prime minister, and the other is the princess who will inherit the throne. They are both proud of their dirty hands of labor. Compared with the general man who regards fair fingers as noble, and the general woman who regards red nail polish as beautiful, it is completely different.</p>
<p>No matter how far mechanical inventions go, people's working hands will always be valuable. Hard work is not just a matter for our ancestors, it will also be a matter for our descendants. Although "handicrafts" are outdated, working hands are permanently useful. If you only love your delicate hands, let your lover stroke them, and let your distinguished guests shake them, and you "stand by with your hands in your sleeves" for everything you should do, then in the future you will inevitably end up with "nothing to do" no matter what you discuss, or even "waiting for death with your hands tied."</p>
<p>After the British Labor Party came to power, even the hands of Princess Elizabeth, as noble as the heir to the throne, were inevitably those that were proud of labor and had grease on them (not nail polish). This symbolizes the rebirth of Britain and the progress of Britain.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Revitalizing Morality</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>General He Yingqin gave an interview to the United Press in New York on his proposed plan to stop the Chinese civil war. He advocated revitalizing morality to give the country a new standard of morality. He was quoted as saying: "The only way to completely eradicate the Communist Party is for the National Government to promote reform and win the hearts of the people in the Communist-controlled areas." The United Press reporter said that He was a professional soldier, but now he has come up with this argument, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>In fact, no matter how intrigue there is between countries, no matter how rampant power politics are in the world, everyone knows that the taste of war is not fun, and war cannot solve any dispute. After the First World War, it was followed by the Second World War. The peace conference is still in progress, and there are hidden worries about the Third World War. This shows that war cannot bring true peace!</p>
<p>General He Yingqin advocates revitalizing morality to eliminate the civil war, which is the same as in international wars. Although He has not explained the meaning of the word morality, I believe it must be based on a belief of mutual understanding, mutual respect, and mutual assistance; it is a constructive and evolutionary social force. Only with such a standard can people's hearts not fall, and human desires will not flow and collapse.</p>
<p>In today's world of reason's decline, we may think that raising the word morality is a pedantic theory. However, if there is no moral standard, everyone is planning for their own self-interest, how can our society have a day of purification? Today, our country is full of corrupt officials, corrupt clerks, unscrupulous merchants, bandits, rape, fraud, and other personnel matters, which does not explain that the morality of our society has been lost?</p>
<p>After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our material destruction has certainly caused heavy losses; but the corruption of our national morality has affected our national construction process, which may be more significant than material losses!</p>
<p>Therefore, rebuilding the power of morality is really the main factor for our national revival. The rise and fall of a nation depends on whether it can have a social morality that is appropriate for the times. Japan was defeated, but the Japanese people can endure hardships and strive to rebuild their country under control. This spirit of "hard work" and "endurance" is their current moral standard.</p>
<p>However, in order to revitalize people's hearts with morality and maintain the people's trust, it is necessary for the generally enlightened people to practice it faithfully and form a habit. Therefore, how the officials and people in the education and cultural circles in China today rectify their work and strive to love themselves is even more important for exerting the power of morality.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Watching Football</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>Sing Tao and Han City met at Yiguo, and although a few of us cannot be considered football fans, we went excitedly to watch the game. Expecting the audience to be crowded, we hurriedly ate lunch and set off. But unexpectedly, there was a problem with the tickets; we did not have the strength to "squeeze," so we had to ask the black market for help. "5,000 sold for 6,000." We felt that it was not worth spending a thousand yuan more, and it was not "painful" to take out the money to exchange for the tickets. (The paper is yellow. When we entered the gate, we found that some people were holding tickets with white paper. I don't know why the tickets for the same time were divided into colors).</p>
<p>Squeezing through the park gate, the problem became more and more serious: people! There were people everywhere! Not to mention the stands, even the roofs, trees, and even the football field were full of people. The players came and could not kick off, and even the military police could not maintain order. A military policeman's head was hit by a "stray brick" and was injured.</p>
<p>It was easy to clear a football field, but after a few minutes of kickoff, the ball disappeared. The crowd was pushing and shoving. Seeing that the "situation" was not right, we hurriedly withdrew from Yiyuan together. W often fantasizes, and he was the first to start discussing:</p>
<p>"Servility! The military police's advice is not effective; if the military police's attitude is not gentle, there will be a fight. Who dares to be wild in front of a bayonet? Servility! A hundred points of servility!"</p>
<p>H is the most face-conscious person, and he obviously does not agree with W's opinion, so he asks W in return:</p>
<p>"Are you not Chinese? Is that how you say Chinese people are servile? ——However, this is too embarrassing: watching the ball and running to the field to watch, setting off firecrackers, shouting, disorder, I'm sorry to foreign friends." When he finished speaking in a series, I interjected:</p>
<p>"Selling unlimited tickets, at least selling tickets without prediction, may not be right? Don't just talk about servility and face."</p>
<p>"Where!" W said aggressively: "It is very likely that there is a planned sabotage. You squeeze in with tickets, and you squeeze in without tickets, and you still squeeze into the field to make the game impossible!"</p>
<p>M also opened his mouth:</p>
<p>"You say sabotage, where is the evidence? What is the reason?"</p>
<p>"Sabotage is sabotage, isn't it a very obvious fact? Weren't you at the stadium? Didn't you see it?"</p>
<p>What exactly is going on? Let it be a mystery!</p>
<h3>Angel</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Man A: What kind of person is your wife?</p>
<p>Man B: Ah, she is an angel, really an angel.</p>
<p>Man A: Well, you are much happier than me. My wife is still alive.</p>
<h3>A Record of Listening to a Symphony Orchestra Performance</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>On April 27, the Municipal Government Concert in Lanxin was full before 5 o'clock. Many people left because they did not have tickets, and a few people squeezed to the back.</p>
<p>The opening was Beethoven's Coriolan Overture. At the beginning, there was a heavy tone and a momentary pause. This sound seemed to be flashing, making the entire audience tense. Beethoven's works are always great and fiery.</p>
<p>Next was Resspighi's Suite: This is completely different from the previous overture.</p>
<p>The third program was Mozart's Symphony No. 39. Mozart is the representative of the classical school, and now most new school people say he is too old-fashioned. However, Mozart's works never feel novel the first time you listen to them, and you will not get tired of listening to them dozens of times. This is Mozart's characteristic.</p>
<p>After the break was Elgar's Elegy, a string ensemble. Elgar is a very famous modern British composer, but this tune is very ordinary.</p>
<p>The last two pieces were both by Grainger. The first was an arrangement of an Irish tune, which was played by a string and two French horns. This tune was really very good and very easy to accept. The last piece was also Grainger's work - Shepherd's Call, short and pleasant. Under the constant applause of the audience, it was repeated once, with the same brilliance.</p>
<p>All the team members played well, and the string section performed the best. One or two of the wind instrument players were former Municipal Council members, but they were not very good. But in any case, this achievement is already very remarkable. I hope that the next performance (May 11) will be even more exciting than this one. We are waiting for the training of Professor Arlic, and of course he will not disappoint us. He will definitely make us feel more satisfied each time.</p>
<h3>Morphine</h3>
<p>— Ma Jin</p>
<p>On April 12, the Cai E ship of the Reception Bureau arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin. Eight large bags of morphine were seized from the luggage of several female passengers, weighing 77.4 taels, worth about 300 million yuan.</p>
<p>This news greatly shocked my soul, and made me think of the enemy's cruel and thorough drug policy against China. The victory has been coming for almost two years, and Tianjin is still the main den for manufacturing and selling drugs. What else can be said?</p>
<p>In the north, morphine is commonly called white powder. Wherever the enemy cavalry passed, there was white powder. During the occupation, even in the remote mountain villages of Hebei and Shanxi, the operation of tea and smoke shops may have been normal, but the white powder business must not be lacking, because it is in great demand and highly profitable. Therefore, in the vast areas of the Yellow River, no matter how poor or rich the family, no matter how men or women, even children of more than ten years old are addicted to drugs. The intensity of the harm and the depth of the poison can be imagined.</p>
<p>Before the July 7th Incident, the Japanese concession in Tianjin was the main base for the production and sale of drugs. Japanese and Korean ronin were in charge of it. During the war, they used the labor of the military to cover up their activities, and this industry became more rampant. The raw material for white powder is opium. Around 1940, the provinces of Jin, Cha, and Sui received secret orders from the Japanese puppets to plant poppy seedlings on a large scale. I don't know if they have disappeared after the victory?</p>
<h3>Arts and Literature Scene</h3>
<p>Chengdu currently has two theaters. The Sullivan Theater is currently performing "Chu Ge," written by Yao Ke. The China Art Theater is performing "Carnival Night." Another report says that the China Victory Theater will soon stage "Fragrant Grass on the Horizon," written by Xia Yan, in a guerrilla-style performance.</p>
<p>Wang Xiyan is still in Fuzhou, editing the "Literary Arts" section of the Fuzhou Times. Recently, he asked friends in Shanghai for submissions. He specifically stated upfront regarding the payment, "It is pitifully low."</p>
<p>The Chengdu Literary Association held a gathering for members on the May Fourth Literary Day and re-elected the board of directors.</p>
<h3>On Reclusion</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>Here is a story mocking a monk:</p>
<p>"Wu Yuanci (Qi) traveled to Guangzhou. There was a monk named Da Shan who waited daily at the doors of the Governor-General, Generals, and various judicial commissioners. One day, he complained to Wu that social engagements were numerous and annoying, making him suffer greatly. Wu smiled and replied, 'Since you suffer so much, why not become a monk?'" ("Notes from Yixiang Ancestor" by Wang Shizhen)</p>
<p>There are several types of monks: One type is the "deserter" from the battlefield of life; another type is, "If monks don't marry, where do young monks come from?" Yet young monks are eventually sent to the temple, from childhood to adulthood, never knowing what "home" is, let alone what "becoming a monk" means; yet another type emerges from lay practitioners, appearing world-weary and cynical, but in reality, they are victims of "refinement"; the last type are those who style themselves as poet-monks, with six senses purified and an arrogant demeanor, yet sometimes deeply desiring to be listed on the candidate official list, sneaking through the back door of powerful officials, "Like a swallow gathering in the clouds, flying to and from the prime minister's yamen."</p>
<p>Yang Chengzhai's poem says: "Before donning the cassock, there are many matters to discuss; after donning the cassock, there are even more matters." I don't know which category the monk Da Shan should be placed in. — "Why not become a monk!" He has "left" once already.</p>
<p>True hermits are not like this.</p>
<p>Zhu Hui'an said: "Hermits are all people with strong personalities and grievances, like Tao Yuanming, who wanted to achieve something but couldn't." This truly speaks to the inner thoughts of true hermits. Qu Yuan, with his strong personality and grievances, couldn't bear to truly seclude himself and eventually drowned in the Miluo River; Cai Yong, who wanted to seclude himself, immediately knelt under the phrase "I can implicate your clan," unable to hide; although Tao Yuanming was relatively detached, he couldn't avoid "Xingtian wielding a thousand axes," and boasting that his "fierce ambition is always present." Someone said:</p>
<p>"Tao Qian in the late Jin Dynasty was similar to Kong Rong in the late Han Dynasty and Ji Kang in the late Wei Dynasty, all close to the time of dynastic change. But he did not express any vehement emotions, thus earning the name of a pastoral poet. However, there is a poem in Tao's collection called 'Describing Wine,' which discusses the politics of the time... From this, it can be seen that Tao Qian could not transcend the mortal world, and he was still concerned about court affairs and could not forget death, which he frequently mentioned in his poems."</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, Tao Qian, though unable to become the "refined person" in the eyes of affected individuals, still retained his warm humanity—a common person. A true hermit should be like this: "Fit for the court, then serve the court; fit for the wilderness, then live in the wilderness." Without hypocrisy, there is no affectation. Unable to benefit the world, one can at least preserve one's own integrity.</p>
<p>Jiao Xun said it well:</p>
<p>"People cannot hide, cannot truly hide, and there is no such thing as hiding. One who has the learning of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius but does not serve can be called a recluse; however, one who has the learning of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius will certainly not hide. People like Xu You, Chao Fu, and Ju Ni claimed to be of isolated nature, knowing that they could not benefit the country or the people, so they hid in the mountains and forests to conceal their talents. Therefore, they have an abundance of poetic expression about the wind and the moon, and an abundance of unconventional behavior to criticize the world and maintain their independence, but they are insufficient to hold the reins of the world... Therefore, tilling the land for food and digging wells for drink is a matter of allocation... Fit for the court, then serve the court; fit for the wilderness, then live in the wilderness. The sage's hiding is to wait for the time to be used. To claim seclusion without the means to be useful is absurd."</p>
<p>This should be a good sobering agent for the likes of Monk Da Shan today.</p>
<h3>Book Famine</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>Reports state: Shanxi is experiencing a severe book famine, and even textbooks from the enemy-puppet period are still in circulation. Victory has been nearly two years, and this situation seems to need to be ended.</p>
<p>Leaving aside Shanxi, where printing conditions lag behind, even in Shanghai, there are many shortcomings in the current printing of elementary school textbooks: misprints, missing strokes, blurriness, and inconsistencies are abundant. These not only harm the eyesight of elementary school students but also increase their chances of writing words incorrectly. In Shanghai, where printing conditions are quite superior, these shortcomings should not exist. I wonder why these shortcomings are still allowed to persist? Has the time for rectifying these shortcomings not yet arrived?</p>
<p>No one would deny the importance of basic education, but if the tools (the most basic tools) directly related to basic education are not done well, what about the rest?</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Crisis</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Old Zhu is giving it his all!" Zhang Chang nodded and wagged his head, saying, "He didn't even come back for lunch today. He must be there again, badgering that transportation director for a solution!"</p>
<p>The people in the room looked at each other with little optimism.</p>
<p>Old Zhu has been earnestly running around for almost a month!—all to borrow one or two trucks. But the number of people remaining in this city in crisis is dwindling day by day, and the more those who remain behind linger, the more ruthless their hearts become. It can be said that whether they are party members, government officials, military personnel, businessmen, scholars, or workers, those who have vehicles in their hands have become influential figures who look down on everyone, the most loyal believers in realism. National interests, relatives, friends—no one cares about anything. Everyone's minds are filled with only themselves, only goods, only cash—cash that can be converted immediately. Checks won't do!</p>
<p>The enemy is about to attack. Who will resist? How will they resist? What will we do if they chase us? Escape to Tibet? Escape to the Himalayas?... From beginning to end, no one in this city has considered it. It's as if the War of Resistance is someone else's business, and they only care about one thing—escaping!</p>
<p>A city in crisis! It's not really a city in crisis, is it? It should be called "City of Fools" to be truly fitting!</p>
<p>After half a day of discussing the problem of vehicles, the group of fools suddenly brought up Xu Shaoming, the general manager of Zhongfu Company, and his famously assertive Shandong wife, who came from a drum-singing background.</p>
<p>"That woman is really something!" Zhang Chang said naively, "With her bold and fierce personality, she actually has a great talent for music. Yesterday, Old Chen and I passed by the Xu's house and heard someone playing the guitar inside, playing it very well. Later, I ran into Mrs. Hu in Dongjiang, who said that she also plays the violin, but unfortunately..."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, she married Xu Jieming, otherwise you could become friends with her. Right?" someone immediately interjected jokingly.</p>
<p>"Then Xiao Zhang would be out of luck!" Lu Qian couldn't help but break into a smile. "Your ears would probably be torn at least twice a week, and you wouldn't be able to play the harmonica anymore!"</p>
<p>Zhang Chang squinted his eyes and made a face.</p>
<p>"I don't like her at all!" After a pause, he changed his tone and said, "Compared to Mrs. Hu, she is far inferior! Mrs. Hu is not only beautiful and has a gentle personality, but she can also be said to be a standard artist who hasn't deteriorated!" (58)</p>
