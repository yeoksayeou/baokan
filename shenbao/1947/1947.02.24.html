<p>〔中央社吉林廿三日電〕東北壯麗山河間，物產之富，種類之繁，品質之優，不獨為國內各地所不及，實亦世界地理上所僅有。森林，礦物，農產，漁牧，所在都有，且無不豐盛，而巨川大山，更有珍異特產，馳名遐邇，長白及興安諸系山脈中，多猞猁，玄狐，紫貂等獸，其皮毛極為世人珍視；至名貴之藥材，為人參，鹿茸，哈馬油等，更遍銷南北，為無上之補劑，其中哈馬油為採集山泉中青蛙剝製而成，其肉滿含油質，白如象脂，尤為珍異。松花江中，則魚產極豐，鯉魚，魚，　魚，鱸魚，重唇魚，及各種淡水流魚，雖在冬季擊冰打魚，亦每綱皆滿，而白魚·鯉魚，尤美名遠播，遜清時為進貢之物，現之來吉林觀光者，亦無不飽啖盛讚而去。松江下游之深水中，且產珍珠，清庭并曾設官專管此事，但頻年烽煙遍地，人民流徙，凡百生業，均已零落凋敝，珍貴皮毛，除舊藏外，久已絕跡市場，如貂皮　　價格雖至八十萬元（均為東北流通券以下同。）亦難購得，人參，老山參，每錢一萬八千元，圓參（即人工種植者）一千五百元，鹿茸每兩一萬五千元，中等九千元，普通七千元，惟野參野鹿多產於現在共軍控制下之山地，來源奇缺，故市場圓參較多，而烏拉街及吉林週圍各農村，有養鹿人家甚多，鹿茸來源尚　。哈馬油之主要產地，為樺甸，蛟河，磐石等陰濕山地，現每年可獲蛙約一百萬只，每百只可出油一斤，每斤價格七千元。松花江魚產，單吉林省境，過去每年在千萬斤以上，以此為生者，約達萬人，且有漁業組織，但目前均為零星捕售，并無統計。刻吉林省建設廳正計劃於小興滿發電廠旁之蓄水池等處，作大規模之捕打與增殖。魚價最低者一百元，白魚最高為三百元，珍珠產於合江省之寗錦一帶，尚未收復，人民疲於奔命，恐已不暇探採矣。俗云「吉林三寳」者，人參，貂皮外，尚有所謂烏拉草，此實一種山野遍生之植物，乾後職長柔軟，以之填於革製之鞋內，即成為「烏拉鞋」保暖防濕，人民均賴以度過冰天雪地之冬季。</p>
<h3>蘇報被搗毀案　雙方各執一詞</h3>
<p>蘇教廳今派員澈查</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕本邑蘇報被蘇省中女師學生搗毀問題，王省主席特電縣府切實調解，并對學生失於理智控制之情感衝動，甚表遺憾，深盼今後學生情緒能化干戈為祥和。惟今日縣府派員調查時，雙方均各執一詞，在蘇報則認為新聞旣已數度更正，學生更提啟事道歉及交出記者之要求，實逾出版法之範圍，而當尚未拒絕正進行商討時，即藉眾搗毀器材紙張，顯為有計劃之行動。在兩校學生則認為愛護校譽，理所當然，縱行動失當，亦不能視為過意，故此案大約須由省黨部與教廳直接研討，始可圓滿解決。現教廳已定二十四日派員來蘇，澈查真相。</p>

<h3>要徵收財產稅嗎？</h3>
<p>人國直接稅務會議，在其開闢新稅源之項目中，聞有徵收一次財產稅之議，議案內容如何，我們尚未寓目。通過與否，通過以後，政府是否核準施行，亦尚在不可知之數。</p>
<p>現在財政極芳困難，不得不時時增發鈔票，以資彌補，致造成通貨膨脹，高物價與高工資等不安定的現象。為緩和或中止此等現象起見，改用增稅等其他辦法以資替代，在理論上自元可非議。惟徵收一次財產稅，這辦法流弊太大，執行太難，實有慎重檢討之必要。</p>
<p>第一，是太沒有基礎，就是說：課稅的對象，太散漫，太籠統，沒有完備的材料可資依據。動產姑不論，卽就不動產而論，比較最易着手的，無過於房屋與地產。誰都知道：現在最不利，和最吃虧的，莫過於房主。他們的種種捐稅，是不斷地在增加着，而他們的收入—房租，卻受了種種的限制，甚至限制到不够開支，談不到收益，以至建築事業完全停頓，房荒嚴重，各地皆然。在這種狀態下，如果無情地，再加上一次大剝削，請問是否合理？是否公平？</p>
<p>土地原有田賦，軍興以來，又加上無數若干的附徵與攤派。一般農民，早已覺得苛政如虎，無路可走。以至荒廢日　多，農村激劇地衰落。中央深知其苦，所以勝利以後，便馬上明令，　免田賦一年，又迭次通令，嚴禁攤派。事實上雖無大效，卻也可以反證：他們的負担，實已到了無可再增的地步了。何況兵燹之後，有許多縣份，國籍散失，一時還無法整理，不得不用申報或畝捐等生吞活剝的手段來，橫徵暴斂，暫濟一時之急。又豈可雪上加霜，再來一次不合理的聚斂，來增加他們的負担與痛苦？</p>
<p>拿上海和南京這些大都市來看，有的是豪商大賈，達官貴人。從他們那些財產上，抽一次稅，來權濟國用，好像是多取不虐，很合情理。無奈他們的財產，多半是金條，鑽石，外幣，古董，字畫細軟等貴重品，實際上很易隱匿，很難調查。聽說：遺產稅自從開征以來，成績很平常。連幾個著名豪富的人家，也無法征到相當的稅額。就可知財稅稅實在不易辦理，尤其是動產部份，斷不能符合一般人的預期。萬一不顧事實，斷然實行，又無非是無權無勢的中下階級，遭到一次大殃罷了。</p>
<p>第二，是技術豐拙劣，就是說：徵收的手段太不高明。這裏且舉主席的話來證明。十六日，他的談話裏，有下面這句話：</p>
<p>故所得稅與各項直接稅之徵收，未克顯著成效。現在應不求計算之精密，反致曠日持久，而應採迅捷有效之徵收方法。如因此而使個人負擔，容有加重之處，則為一致擁護政府，…而一致予以遵行。</p>
<p>現行的所得稅與各項直接稅。是推行已久，早樹基礎的，還不免曠日持久，未著成效。何況財產稅是新稅，毫無基礎，其範圍之廣泛，與內容之複雜，又遠非所得稅等可比。卽使人民為一致擁護政府，寗願個人負擔，容有加重之處，我們相信，照現在的人事與機構，仍未必能收迅捷有效的功效。</p>
<p>談到租稅，總是愈有基礎的愈好。緃使理論上或者欠缺些，但以行之已久，相沿成習，其不合理的部份，也以我們認為開闢新稅。總不如整頓舊稅，而整頓舊稅，尤以補偏救敝，為最重要，現行的所得稅與各項直接稅，旣然計算未密，曠日太久，未必顯著成效，那麼，對症發藥，自然應從此等處下手為宜。這個責任，在辦理直接稅的人員，可稱是無可傍貸的。放着可以整頓，和應該整頓的現成稅收不談，而挖空心思，另覓曠日持久，和不易計算的新對象來求增加收入，未免太不上算罷。</p>

<h3>修改盟約正式談判前　英蘇謀經濟諒解　兩國現行關係有改善希望</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿二日電〕據接近英外部方面今日吿合衆社稱：蘇聯曾提議在與英國修改盟約前，先行對兩國間還世界之安全需要，獲致全部諒解與先締結一經濟協定。據英方消息，蘇方曾提議稱，兩國問之未來關係，乃不能與海外交通，將來之原料獲得，世界商業，以及所調未獨立領土等事不相關涉也。又聞，蘇聯除願與英繼續保持一九四二年所締結之政治同盟外，又表示願與英國調整經濟關係。英外交專家相信，蘇聯現已有明確之微象，願與英獲得全部之經濟諒解，以為政治同盟公約之補充。蘇聯深盼英國予以大量之機器及其他生產工具，以交換蓋聯之原料。英蘇貿易談判在若干時以前業己進行，但由於雙方供應及所需要之商品甚感困難而吿擱淺。蘇聯需要英國五金工具，引擎，紡織機器，馬逹，鍋爐，起重機，及其他重工業器材。在去年十二月英國雖將其所需之貨物，列表送交蘇聯，其中木材佔重要地位。英商務大臣克利浦斯雖表示未來英蘇貿易，能有充分擴充之希望，蘇駐英貿易代表團業已返國會商。上週莫斯科電台用英語廣播稱，英蘇兩國問之戰後經濟合作極且希望，並聲明蘇維埃制度並不對任何外國之經濟關係造成貿易壁壘。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約廿二日專電〕馬歇爾就任國務卿以來，今在普林斯敦大學首次發表公開演辭稱：美國之領導性協助，為甚多國家之恢復和平及民主進展中所不可少者。美國人對國際事務之態度，誠有嚴重之缺點，渠稱，吾人已停止戰爭，然尙無眞正之和平。在國內吾人正處於戰時經濟與和平經濟之過渡狀態中，在歐洲及亞洲各處仍有　荒，各强國之關係正在變動狀態中。吾人尙須自混亂中獲得秩序，和平亦尙待爭取，然此事能有幾何成就，大都將視美國人民而定。其他各國俱已在經濟金融及物質上感到筋疲力盡。馬氏要求美國人民在考慮國際局勢時，應更注意歷史之遠景。渠抨擊旁觀態度，故尤其要求年靑人對歷史應有眞正之瞭解，常發展對世界秩序及安全之責任感。馬氏在演辭中，提及中國時，僅為表白上决渠係在中國慶祝華盛頓誕辰者。</p>
<h3>美託管計劃　英蘇仍持異議</h3>

<h3>德境蘇軍佔領區　旅行漫記</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>作者和友好二人，由一位蘇聯籍擲導伴同着，在蘇聯控制下的德國境內作了一次一千英里的旅行。我們曾經訪問各階層的德國民衆，內</p>
<p>有政治家，產業工人，敎師，主婦，農民，報館主筆，市長和牧師。我們曾經和蘇聯軍政府官員，宣傳家和士兵們談話。</p>
<p>兩個基本問題</p>
<p>作者心目中存着兩個基本問題：第一，為什麼大多數的德國人都認為蘇聯統治下的生活是混亂而悲苦的？第二，蘇聯在德國的基木政策是什麼？</p>
<p>關於第一個問題的答案是不容易得到的。我們從柏林到德萊斯登一路所經過的地方似乎很平靜，很肥沃。每一塊土地都是開墾過的。在沒有受過炸彈洗禮的工業區裏，機器都開動着，烟囪裏都冒着濃烟。</p>
<p>糧食供應情形</p>
<p>糧食情况怎麼樣呢？試執一德人而問之，他一定馬上拿出他的配給證來。很奇怪的，這裏的糧食配給額比較盟軍佔領下的德國其他各地更為豐多—德國人對於這一個惠實好像和我們同隊的漫不經意。</p>
<p>然而蘇聯佔領區內的民衆非但沒右營養充足的表現，反而都現出憔悴飢餓的模樣。美國佔領區內肥碩的德國人雖不多觀，可是在這裏欲我到一個體重及格的德國人，確實異常困難。</p>
<p>這是因為在蘇聯佔領區內，黑市差不多完全不存在的。在美國控制下的區域裏，凡是有錢的人都可以從墨市裏得到額外的糧食，然而在蘇聯佔領區內，人們祇能靠配給的東西來維持生計。</p>
<p>德人何以反蘇</p>
<p>旅行家們看到這裏的秩序井然的情形，對於多數德國人反蘇情緒，似乎覺得有些蹊巧而且不合情理。是不是由於紅軍的行為粗暴而使然？和我談過話的德國人—內有作者的舊兩二人，當然不致對我說謊的—一致承認蘇聯佔領軍的行為是頗令人滿意的。</p>
<p>難道德國人是長懼蘇聯的肅淸納粹勢力的措置？實際上蘇聯在這方面所採取的政策並沒有美國當局所採取的那麼嚴峻。在美國佔領區內，凡屬納粹黨員一概不能担任重要的職位。但是居蘇聯佔領區內，所有以前的納粹黨員，除了幾個大官以外，只要和蘇聯人廝混在一起，他們的身份是極容易被遺忘了的。</p>
<p>雖然有此種種事實，而德國人還是仇恨蘇聯人，推原其故，或許是受着德國宣傳部長戈培爾的宣傳的影響吧。現在居住在英美佔領區內的德國人，以前聽慣了「俄國人是殺人不眨眼的惡魔」的宣傳，認為生活在蘇聯轄區內是一件非常可怕的事。</p>
<p>反之，在大多數德國人的心目中，覺得英美人是和善，奢侈，而多少帶些滑稽色彩的人物。因此住在蘇聯佔領區內的德國人義慕着住在英美區內的同胞，覺得他們是生活優裕而且閒情逸致的。</p>
<p>這許多誤解和誤會的產生，蘇聯人自己當然也不能辭其咎的。他們即使沒有什麼隱秘的地方，也往往故作玄秘，令人懷疑。現在這種猜疑的目光集中在蘇聯的寵兒社會統一黨身上—那是由德國社會黨和共產黨合併而成的政黨。</p>
<p>蘇方文化活動</p>
<p>蘇聯政策在文化活動方面是特別顯著的。蘇聯當局竭力主持並鼓舞佔領區內德國人的文化生活—那文化並不是「普羅」式的文藝，而是德國的自由主義的文化。</p>
<p>在我們所參觀過的許多公立學校校裏，也找不出一些馬克斯主養的迹象來。據琴那大學校長佐克教授吿訴我們，蘇聯當局儘量給他種種帮助，但並不干涉他的計劃。</p>
<p>蘇聯人縱然充滿了反德情緒，然而對於德國政冶和文化問題似乎異常關切，這一事實在西方國家的人看來，雖非驚人，似乎有些難於索解。他們的用意究竟何在？近來盛傳蘇德將締結同盟以控歐洲的謠言，是否有幾分眞實？</p>
<p>蘇聨對德態度</p>
<p>蘇聯的計劃，局外人當然無從得知。但無論那計劃怎樣，目前對於蘇德結成集團的恐瞿似乎是很牽强的。蘇聯此刻顯然在竭力加強德國左冀陣綫的實力，然而對於德國共產黨並不當作「同志」或「同盟」看待，只是當作協助佔領軍當局處理行政事務的助手看待。</p>
<p>一般德國人的見解是：與其和蘇聯駢肩作戰，無寗帮英美毀滅蘇聯，故一般蘇聯人對於聯合德國對美宣戰的見解，必一笑置之。因為蘇聯人雖然嫌恨德國人，倒並不討厭美國人，同時對於美國國內的反蘇情緒似乎也漢不關心似的。</p>
<p>德國人認為美蘇之間遲早要發生戰爭的，因此德國人見到美國人和蘇聯人怡然相處的情形便覺得驚奇·但居住在德國的美國人則認為德國人的那種見解是可笑的。他們覺得：撇開政治不談，美國人和蘇聯人之間原無什麼仇恨存在，彼此何必要發生交惡或相打呢？</p>
<p>德國曾遭戰爭洗禮也區之破壞情形，此皆受希魔長略狂之賜</p>

<h3>具有七十五年歷史的　徐家匯天文臺</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕徐家匯天文台，是中國最早研究天文氣象的地方，也是中國現代科學的發源地。遠在三百餘年前，明末徐光啓與利瑪寳湯若望交游甚密，介紹西洋天文曆算至中國，地點即在徐家匯。那時徐家匯還僅是小小的一個村洛。</p>
<p>主要工作</p>
<p>徐家匯大文台，發軔於淸同治十一年（一八七二年），迄今已七十五年了。當時上海開埠，市况繁榮，進出的船隻日多。往往因颶風爲災，慘遭滅頂。其時上海萬國商團，請求天主敎神父Dechevrens設立觀象台，來作預測氣象的工作，神父便允許了，但以電報局免費拍發電報爲條件，經電政當局允准，遠東的新式天文台，即在其時誕生。</p>
<p>氣象預測，為徐家匯天文臺的主要工作，對航海界曾有極大的貢獻。在已往六七十年中，每年沿海不知發生了多少次的颶風，因大文台的警報工作，使無數船隻，得免於難。他們和其他五十餘個氣象台，測候所經常聯路，將每天所探測的氣象紀錄，分四决向外報吿。同時每天從各處收到的氣象報吿，有二百餘份，和海洋中的商船軍艦，也隨時互通聲氣，遇到颶風吹近上海時，天文台派神父到外濰的信號塔上守候，答覆船長們的詢問，至颶風到埠，即發警報，在外灘能很淸晰地聽到。</p>
<p>研究地磁地震</p>
<p>徐家匯天文台，又從事於地磁和地震的研究，六七十年來地磁變遷的紀錄，那裏都保存着。光緒三十年，上海開始行駛電車，地磁研究，頗有妨碍，於是遷至崑山縣境的陸家浜。那裏有精密的儀器和熟練的工作人員。民國十一年，政府和日本科學家合祚的沿海地磁調查，所用的儀器和技術人員，都是由徐家匯天文台供給的。地震部迄今仍在徐家匯，備有新儀器，像維希脫式水平動儀，加利津式垂直儀等，都很精密，在世界地震界，佔着重要地位。</p>
<p>標準時計</p>
<p>標準時計，也是徐家匯天文台工作的一部門，那裏有兩架新式的計時器，安置在地審中，保持一定溫度和氣壓，每天錯誤，不會超過百分之一秒，至正午十二時和晚上九時，用無綫電播送標準時間，道時港內船隻，便可以糾正他們船上的鐘點。國際天文協會曾指定三處地方，作爲標準時計處，徐家匯天文台乃其中之一，他們除記錄和報吿時刻以外，還做研究工作，道是從民國十五年開始的。</p>
<p>佘山的設備</p>
<p>眞正的天文研究工作，却在距離上海十五哩的佘山，表面有四十公分徑的赤道儀，經常用來觀察天象。在過去，曾從望遠鏡裏攝取太陽黑點，憑了一萬多張照片，來決定一萬四千個星球的位置，又曾研究過一千二百個星座的現象，木星擾亂其他行星的軌道。計算至百决以上。佘山的天文設備，十分豐富精美，而工作成績，因爲日積月累，也有很好的表現。</p>
<p>巡廻工作</p>
<p>徐家匯天文臺的工作，除徐家匯的氣象預測，時計，和地震研究，及佘山的天文觀察，陸家浜的地磁試騐外，又做各地巡廻工作。曾有幾次至內地旅行，在長江上游，測繪地圖五十四幅，決定五十個城市的方位。沿海各地的燈塔，也常去巡視，檢查儀器的準確性。</p>
<p>最近政府爲維護主權起見，令飭徐家匯天文台，停止天氣預告和氣象廣播的工作。這有七十五年歷史的氣象工作，將與外界人士吿別。但他們的工作並不中止，不過不對外公開而已。本來主持徐家匯天文合氣象工作的意籌神父龍相全，早受上海氣象台之聘，今後徐家匯天文台，對於上海氣象台，仍會畫力協助。</p>

<h3>高院看守所　賽如大公寓　六樓高廈設備完善　未決漢奸悉數多入</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院看守所所址原係美軍軍事法庭，新近由高院向美軍接收，始吿成立。所長由高院推事陳振聲兼任，下設所官一，分設總務，警衛，作業三課，醫務，敎務兩室。三月一日起，忠監中漢奸未決犯五〇一人，將悉數移入該所覉押。該所爲六層樓之鋼骨水泥巨大建築，轟立於上海監獄內之西北角，佔地極廣。入內有自動電梯，五樓有橡皮間，上下四壁均均用厚橡皮砌成，以防犯人觸壁自殺，及覉押患有精神病者之用。三樓有絞刑間，入內陰森之氣，不寒而慄，架上有巨繩三根，行刑時將繩捨於犯人頸際，面覆黑布，立於活動板上，將機關扳動，板即落下，人亦懸空，一瞬間即畢命，落於最下一層，由小門將屍體運出。囚房有單人房間，又有可容四五犯人之大房間，裝有固定舖位，抽水馬桶，寫字　構等，少數因室尚有衣　設備，室內陽光充足，諸如盥洗窒，洗浴間，應有盡有，驟社之，有如一設備完善之大公寓。所旁草坪一方，其中雜種蔬菜，鄧為樂逆鴻志伏法之地。該所內尚有印度看守Bar　Sinsh名，能操滬話，據稱已在監獄股務三十餘年。此屋建築於民國二十年左右，惟該所對於奮理國人囚犯，是否需要外籍看守，値得考慮，故對此印人之留用問題，尚在　究中。</p>

<p>吾國所產狼尾，爲製造毛筆之主要原料，近因皮毛輸出商，將國外並不需要之狼尾連同狼皮一併輸出，以致原料缺乏，勢不得不再向國外採購，使此由中國輸出之狼尾重行輸入，其間輾轉旣費時間，價格又見昂貴，影響吾國文化事業之發展甚大。本市筆墨業商業同業公會，乃於昨日召開常務委員會，議決：（一）請求皮毛輸出商勿將狼尾作無益之輸出，（二）請不就政府禁止狼尾輸出，（三）請求各界人士一致主張以維文化。</p>

<h3>教部封自費留學　慎重發給出國護照</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日訊〕自上年七月間，教育部舉辦公私費留學生考試以來，我國學生前往美，英等國留學者日衆，惟外傳有甚多學生，未經考試亦能取得護照，放洋留學，以致程度參差，良莠不齊，外間頗有訾議，記者特為此事走訪教育部負責人，承答稱：政府於抗戰勝利後，開放留學政策，舉辦公私費留學考試，社會上對此即有兩種不同意見：一以國家復興建設，需材孔殷，應多考選學生，前往國外深造，培養人材，其標準不妨將款，一以留學生必須學有根柢，出國後始能有所造就，且為節省國家外匯其標準亟應從嚴，甚有主張不必有大學畢業限制，亦不應舉辦自費留學考試者。上述兩說，各具見地。而戰後我國之復興建設，在在需人，實屬不容諱言之事實，故本部自奉准恢復舉辦公私費留學考試，即提高取錄之標準，從嚴選派。且鑒於美國自戰後復員以來，個大學學生，極為擁擠，為避免我國學生在外虛擲光陰，浪費金錢，故規定考取之自費生，必須取得國外大學入學證後方准函請外交部頒發護照。自辦理以來，審核綦嚴，從未寬假。至外傳有未經依照本部規定取得出國護照者，則與本部無涉，因可向外交部請頒護照者，不僅本部而已。記者又詢以政府近有停發留學生護照之說，是否屬實，該負責人答稱：本部辦理公私費留學考試，係按照規定辦理，但行政院如有新的規定，本部奉令後自當照辦。</p>

<h3>上海市卅五年教育統計提要</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>過去一年間，上海市各級教育，較之抗戰前，勝利後，在數量上均有突飛猛晋之趨勢，蓋公立學校復員，已次第完成，私立學校亦逐漸開展，識字教育在分期推進，以全市人口之增減情形論，則學生數字之激增，實有驚人之記錄：</p>
<p>全市鳥瞰</p>
<p>項目　戰前（廿六年六月）　勝利後（卅四年十二月）　現在（卅五年十二月）　现在比戰前增加的百分比　現在比勝利後增加的百分比</p>
<p>校數　一、二二七　一、二〇八　一、三七八　增三、三　增十四、一</p>
<p>學生數　二四三、七四四　二五〇、四五四　四二五、一六二　增七四、四七　增六九、七五</p>
<p>社教機關數　一、三七八　一九四　二七〇　減八〇、四　增三九、二</p>
<p>學生數及參加人數　一、二五、七五六　二五四、一二六　三七八、八五八　減六七、二　增四九、一</p>
<p>學校總數增加百分之十四·一，而學生總數增加百分之六九·七五，可以說明上海市教育事業之漸臻經濟化，尤以國民學校大部分實行二部制後，各校學生容量大為增加。至於各級學校各階段的增加情形，詳見後表。</p>
<p>全市各級學校以立別言，公立和市立學校佔百分之二三·三，（市立以外之公立僅佔百分之一·一）私立學校佔百分之七六·七，市立教機關佔百分之六一·五，私立佔百分之三八·五，足見上海學校教育大半尚由私人辦理，此為亟待解決之嚴重問題。惟從公私立學校學生數論，其所佔之百分比情形，略較前者為優異，亦足見公立和市立的學校規模較大，容量較多，私立學校甚多，為設備簡陋，校舍狹小者。</p>
<p>（二）初等教育情形</p>
<p>全市初等學校一·一一六校，學生三一七·七六二人，其戰前戰後和現在的增加情形如下：</p>
<p>項目　戰前（廿六年六月）　勝利後（卅四年十二月）　現在（卅五年十二月）　現在比戰前增加百分比　現在比戰後增加百分比</p>
<p>校數　一、〇四〇　九三五　一、二六　增七、三　增十九、三</p>
<p>學生數　一八八·一七七　一七五、八七四　三一七、七六二　增六八、八　增八〇、七</p>
<p>學生數字從一八八·一七七增至三一七·七六二人，增加百分之六十八以上，其中尤堪注意者，即為市私立的學生數字已見趨平衡，而以市立小學容量推測，則倘能增設現有市立之一倍學校數，則國民教育完全由政府辦理的目標，便可實現。</p>
<p>項目　學校數　百分比　學生數　百分比</p>
<p>公立　二　〇、一　九三九　〇、三</p>
<p>市立　二八二　二五、三　二三七、九三九　四三、四</p>
<p>私立　八三二　七四、六　一七八、八八四　五六、三</p>
<p>共計　一、一一六　一〇〇、〇　三一七、七六二　一〇〇、〇</p>
<p>全市學齡兒童（六歲至十二歲），根據民政出卅五年十月份的人口統計，分析結果，為四二五·九九五人，在學兒童，已佔百分之七二·八以上，尚有一〇八、二四三個學童未入學，參看上海市一年內的初等學校學生數增加的趨勢觀察，此十萬八千餘的失學兒童，再一年有六個月，便可全數入學，假定每學級以五十人計算，則须添加二一六五級，亦可使全數學童入學。</p>
<p>（三）中等教育情形</p>
<p>就中等教育言，全市中等學校二二三校，學生七九·二七九人，其戰前戰後和現在的增減情形如下：</p>
<p>項目　戰前　勝利後　現在　現在比戰前﹪　現在比勝利後﹪</p>
<p>校數　一五三　二四一　二二三　增四五·八　增九·五</p>
<p>學生數　四三·六六六　五九·八四二　七九·二七九　增八一·六　增二四·五</p>
<p>在淪陷期間，中等學校紛紛設立，校數頓增勝利後經教育局加以整頓後，略形減少，至現在為止，較戰前增百分之四五·八，學生數較戰前增百分之八一·六，再從公私立別上推究，則市立中學無論校數與學生數均不如市立初等學校所佔之百分比遠甚。</p>
<p>項目　校數　百分比　學生數　百分比</p>
<p>公立　三　一·四　二·二三八　二·九</p>
<p>市立　一一　九·四　一一·二八四　一四·二</p>
<p>私立　二二三　一〇〇·〇　七九·二七九　一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>（四）高等教育情形</p>
<p>專科以上學校在此一年內，因在滬之國立學校大都復員完成，因此增加甚多，至卅五年十二月止，市內專科以上學校卅九校，學生二八·一二一人，按民政處人口統計，全市受高等教育者為七〇·二六七人，　則上海市在學之高教學生應佔百分之四〇·一，其戰前戰後和現在的增减情形及立别比較如下：</p>
<p>項目　戰前　勝利後　現在　現在比戰前﹪　現在比勝利後﹪</p>
<p>校數　三四　三二　三九　增一四·七　增二一·九</p>
<p>學生數　一一·九〇一　一四·七五六　二八·一三一　增一三·七　增九一·九</p>
<p>立別比較：</p>
<p>項目　校數　百分比　學生數　百分比</p>
<p>公立　一〇　二五·六　一一·七一九　四一·七</p>
<p>市立　三　七·七　五一五　一·八</p>
<p>私立　二六　六六·七　一五·八八七　五六·五</p>
<p>共計　三九　一〇〇·〇　二八·一二一　一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>（五）社會教育情形</p>
<p>上海市社教機關二七一所，學校式佔百分之八五·四，一般式佔百分之一四·六，在學的民衆五二·六五九人，參加一般社教機關活動者每月有三二六·一九九人，兩項合計約佔全市總人口十分之一弱。茲將其公私立情形比較如下：</p>
<p>項目　機關數　百分比　學生數及參加人數　百分比</p>
<p>市立　一六六　六一·五　三四〇·一八〇　八九·七</p>
<p>私立　一〇四　三八·五　三八·六七八　一〇·三</p>
<p>共計　二七〇　一〇〇·〇　三七八·八五八　一〇〇·〇</p>

<p>各一平手</p>
<p>比賽於二時三刻開始，裁判吳守衡，巡邊員樂秀榮，陳吉祥蘇聯開球，即遭阻回，不久捲土重來，勞勃司托夫中路擺渡，左翼高洛諾夫舉足力射，蘇聯首破網窠，時距開賽僅三分鐘。東華反攻，三分鐘後，韓龍海得幼良傳　，回敬一球，扳成平手。</p>
<p>東華佔先</p>
<p>「外甥」陳明哲力射，成野球逸去，蘇聯捷林考夫遙送，劳勃司托夫　上一頂，亦告斜出，不久蘇聯環攻東華之門，幸鐔福楨解圍，東華李垚單槍匹馬，功虧一簣，孫錦順一射，亦為鮑賽維區操住，直至廿六分鐘時，龍海直入，騙過谷托夫，拉起一腳，低射入左角，東華以二比一後來居上。上半時旋即告結束。</p>
<p>又成各二</p>
<p>易門再戰，破陣重圍，蘇聯軍容，略有調動，東華依舊原班人馬，番將協力反攻，二分鐘內，卡普司汀右邊掃射，邦綸未防此　，球竄入網，乃成各二平局。東華心有不甘，大舉撻伐，五分鐘時，幼良近門一腳，惜用力太輕，被蘇聯門將抱住。</p>
<p>七戰七勝</p>
<p>未幾龍海施出絕技，立建奇功，東華復以三比二超出。十八分鐘時，李垚左角得球，輕挑傳中，竟告破網，成四比二，奠定勝局。此後雙方互有攻守，均無成就，直至終場，東華以四比二敗蘇聯，造七戰七勝偉績。</p>

<p>雪白遠非敵手</p>
<p>再戰聲裏，綠隊珍寶仍左右逢源，獲分累累，雪白張秀麗錢夢月雖有所獲，但得不償失，三節結束，綠隊四十八雪白二十三。末節雪白大見振作，秀麗夢月連獲數分，五十對二十七時，綠隊伍美英犯規畢業，楊文鵑入代，不就時間告終，綠隊以五十四比三是敗雪白，榮膺女足錦標，戰績錄下。</p>

<h3>日繭運華　頗有成功希望</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關方面消息：關於日繭運華之交涉，近因美國市場上絲價跌落，盟軍總部對此事之能度已有轉變，提出之價格亦較合理，如再繼續磋商，頗有成功希望。據有資格人士吿記者：日本未來絲業之再起，必以席捲南洋市塲為其發展之目標，我國絲業界必須在政府支持之下，同心協力，保衛在南洋之市塲。國絲因水土之關係，染色特勻，為東南亞人士所愛用，必須保持優點，再作改進。如國絲能有南洋之廣大市塲，世界其他地區之銷路即使放棄，亦無關係。</p>
<h3>大批少布運粵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局漢民輪，前日自滬駛廣州，除裝去生仁一千九百餘包，豆餅一千三百塊，肥田粉八百包，豆子四百五十餘包，及雜貨三千五百餘件外，並有棉紗一千一百四十餘件，疋頭一千零四十餘件。該項紗布均係商人所辦者，為去年十月政府禁運紗布往閣粵後，首批所裝之鉅數。前傳紗布南運開禁，迄無確息，客帮方面亟盼此舉能早日實行</p>
<h3>五千元新鈔　央行今日發行　央行今日發行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行為應事實需要，及便利鉅額款項收解起見，頃已決定於今日起，發行五千元票面新鈔券一種。該項新鈔券，分由中央印製廠及大業公司兩家承印。圖案設色，均稱精良，且均屬凹凸版。各界如有需要，可向該行發行局申請兌換云</p>
<h3>證券消息　外股上塲尚須當時期　公債亦無可以開拍之說</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自政府頒行新經濟方案，取締金鈔買賣後，市塲游資，已有向證券市塲集中之趨勢。據某關係方面表示：此實為游資最正常之出路。將來國營生產事眾發歸民營，大致不外乎發行股示。深望證券市塲，能充份發揮其功能，逹成海資資金化，資金證券化之目的云。</p>
<p>又記者為外股上市事，昨特趨訪本市證券交易所某負責人，據談：外股上市之事，各關係外國公司，曾迭决與蹬交當局洽談。惟近以各外國公司正陸續辦理增資事宜，故須俟其先向其本國政府，完成法律登記手續，再經我國主管機關認可後，其股票方可登塲交易，故渠認為尙須相當時期。至公債之開拍，證交前已奉財部令飭：「暫緩開拍」，迄亦未有變更訓令到達，故短時間內，當亦無開拍之可能云。</p>
<h3>中日兩國漁區　函應予以劃分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：有關當局對我國將來漁業之發展，大致已有原則上之決定。我國沿海在地理結構上，係屬世界上良好之魚產區，但成羣之大魚不多，故事實上將以合灣為漁業主要根據地，向西南太平洋發展。惟因環境及設備關係，日本之漁業如不能加以適當之限制，我國一時尙難與之競爭。而日本之漁船可能時時侵入我領海，故有關方面於未來國際會議中，將建議劃分中日兩國在西太平洋之漁區。</p>
<h3>進出口商行　公會決改組</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口商行，在公會成立時僅數百家，至目前已增至一千四百家，故公會方面，決定改組，俾內部組織更趨完整健全。聞該會將於四月一日，召開會員大會，討論改組事宜。目前該公會中各小組委會，因公會決定改組，故業務多已停頓。</p>
<h3>美國採取強硬政策　干涉金鈔投機交易</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿二日電）據此問金銀業中人稱：中國政府最近明令禁止黃金及美鈔自由買賣，或係因美方干涉而出此。美政府現對國內及國外支持資金與美鈔投機之指施，採取更强礦政策。金銀業中人相信外國政府獲得私人方面之消息，謂美政府對於黃金美鈔之投嚴擬加干涉。據擊測：墨西哥停正黃金出口，至少亦係受華盛頓方面之暗示，其他拉丁美洲政府大概亦巳得到此項暗示。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕美商務部頃發表報告稱：一月份出口金條合計二·九一七·〇〇〇盎斯（按上年十二月份為三·三〇二·〇〇〇盎斯，上年一月份三·〇〇〇盎斯。）一月份進口金條計二·三七九·〇〇〇盎斯，（按上年十二月份為一·四四六·〇〇〇盎斯，上年一月份無）。上述三個時期內出口白銀各為二·七四一、〇〇〇盎斯，六·九〇一·〇〇〇盎斯，及二八·七八五·〇〇〇盎斯。又進口白銀各為七·四五一·〇〇〇盎斯，四·〇一〇·〇〇〇盎斯，及九〇九·〇〇〇盎斯。一月份美國貨幣用金增加二一九·四八九·〇〇〇元變為二〇·七四九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，聯邦準備銀行存金自一九六年。〇〇〇·〇〇〇元减少三，六三二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，雙為三·六三二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>

<p>本市配給範粉，加因粉廠原料不濟，商定先由當局負責半月，以　補空檔，同時由各廠貸款收購小麥製粉供應，現收購之麥，將於本星期開始應製，故福新等五廠亦於今日開始先將存紛接替供應配給，價格仍為每包三萬元。惟據粉廠方面透露，配粉價格該業巴向當局提出調整之要求，蓋此次小麥收購，每担為七萬餘元，故麵粉成本每包遠五萬元以上，聞此事將於下月初即可決定。</p>

<h3>萬寶山事件幫兇主犯　脚夫出身　古董　十六年前東北一紅人　郝二爺在吉林獄中</h3>
<p>— 長春十二日航訊　本報駐瀋記者趙展</p>
<p>在寂寞的長春，難得有動人的新聞，像萬寶山事件主犯郝永德在十九日首决公審案，不但轟動長春，也吸行費全國人民的視綫。</p>
<p>這件事，閃爍在中日關係的痛史上，成為中華民族的污點。它是十六年前朝鮮排華運動的導火綫，是九一八的前奏曲，也就是埋藏在東北的第二次世界大戰的火種。</p>
<p>記者於昨日往吉林第一監獄探一訪造成萬賓山事件主犯郝永德，承典獄長允予引見，把他由監房引到典獄長的辦公室。郝永德脚帶重鐐，行動尙不困難，遠遠的先向我們行九十度的鞠躬禮。此人高大身材，背徵駝、長臉寬額，花白鬍鬚，有三寸長，今年七十三歲，還是雙目發光，精神甚佳。身着靑布棉褲棉襖，未穿棉枹，幷無畏寒之態。典獄長請他就坐，向記者介紹，他又起來鞠了一躬。</p>
<p>大夢初醒　情養尷尬</p>
<p>十六年前的萬寳山事件，在他的記憶中大的己被冲淡了顏色，經記者追問，他才如大夢初醒，精神有些尷尬起來，略思片刻設：「我不認字，是莊稼人，那年種地的事，去回家允許去耕種，當時的馬縣長和警察局長，都許可的，於是便約了屯子裏的人去種，到了那裏，人家不讓耕種，便不種了，縣政府判我坐了六個月的監，咱是莊稼人，什麼也不知道，後來，他們說，打起仗來了，實在沒有打仗，也沒有朝鮮人，我又不識字，犯不上和日本人勾結，誰能害咱的國家呢……」。</p>
<p>像這橡轟動一時的血案，他竟然輕描淡寫的說得不算什麼了不得的事，而對於下述事實，他竟然佯稱不知。</p>
<p>重大血案　輕描淡寫</p>
<p>事實是：民國廿年春天，吉林省令准少數韓僑入境種稻，他受長春縣萬寳山村已死之地主張延堂（又名張鴻賓）蕭雨春（蕭增秀）等之慫恿，以銀幣三千元，金鐲兩付，賄通縣長馬仲援（尙在世），尤其所請，勾結韓人沈運澤等，組織長農稻田公司，以長春七馬路韓僑人民會之大陸商會為公司社址，幷勾串當　區長曹彥士為地東保證人，將張延堂等十二戶所有之馬家哨口附近官荒屯等處生荒熟地五百餘垧，（一垧合十畝，）以長農稻田公司名義承租，於同年四月十六日立有租契，租期為十年，繼有違反一九〇九年九月四日間島協約「不准韓人住居及租地」之旨趣，將前開生荒熟地五百餘坰轉租韓人種稻，惟以種槄須引伊通河之水，而該地與伊通河間之距離，有二十餘里之遙，會託鄒春耀等疏通租用，未蒙該地主之允許，竟以取得該中間地引水權，以開發其稻田圖獲不法利益為目的，利用縣府違法之許可及日韓人之勢力，以該地與伊通河中間之地為當然拥溝引水之地，不顧該中間土地地主孫永清等之允許與否，擅與韓人成立契的，公然從各處招聚未入籍之韓僑一百八十八人到該處居住，於同年五月一日即強行掛溝，以致意起被掘地主孫永淸等之反對，申訴中國官憲出而驅逐，此時日本方露出猙獰面目，於同年六月四日，由日太領事館派出警察，持槍到該處保護韓僑，以後日方繼續派警，我方人民因交步無效，於同年七月一日乃聚衆平溝，而日本領事館所派之警察官等，竟向我民衆開槍，雖未受傷，而我民衆不得不因而撤退。</p>
<p>挖溝鋸樹　築壩種稻</p>
<p>同時，日方為擴大宣傳，以致臨成朝鮮境內發生排華之重大修案，結果萬寳山馬家哨口之韓僑，仍於日警持槍保護之下挖溝鋸樹，築　種種，致使各地主不能反抗，共計劃溝長約廿里寬一丈九尺深七尺，挖出兩岸之土佔用民田三丈，共佔有被害人係水淸等廿九戶，所有良田廿坰零一畝及荒田十三响零七分為修　使用，幷砍伐被害人孫永清等柳俾，共計面積數丈之遠，因河中堵　，被書良田百餘垧，及已種稻田廿餘垧。直至同年九月問，尙未完全解決。</p>
<p>兒子留學東洋　大女嫁給日人</p>
<p>記者知道：詢問他當年的事，他不會吐露事實，便轉而詢其家世。他說是天津人，來東北已經五十三年了，原是脚行（搬運夫）起家，有要，有一子兩女，兒子在日本「帝大」念過書，大女兒嫁給日人。記者分廳人說：他本來是開妓館，女兒不是他親生的，而是兩個長得漂亮的妓女，他是首先運用美人計來勾結日本人。</p>
<p>收藏古董　全部沒收</p>
<p>他以脚行出身，居然積致巨富了！</p>
<p>記者又問起他經官方沒收的珍貴古玩之類，是從那兒來的？他回答說：因年輕時候就喜歡古玩古瓷，日久攻買而來。他又說；日本投降後，共產黨把他抓去了兩次：一次押在雙城子，一次押往哈十兩濱，向他要錢，他沒有拿出一個鋼板來，他設他實在是沒有錢。</p>
<p>這位偽滿時代有名的一郝二爺」，原來就是中國下層社會的流氓，他所住長春七馬路，附近都是韓僑，諱僑長之加鬼神，日人也很器重他。在日本處心積慮侵路中國，韓人趁火打刦，中國受苦受難之秋。「郝二爺」便利敵人，錢書同胞，謂為招致外禍的一個罪魁，誰會說一個「不」字。</p>
<h3>星洲澎湃　工潮　日俘變成寶貝</h3>
<p>— 星加坡二日航訊　本報南洋旅行記者求艾</p>
<p>遠東第一軍港，南洋第一大埠的星洲，現在是溝渠不通，　水積　，臭氣冲天了。從二月一日起，除私家事外，靠公共交通工具出入的人又要步行了。馬來半島的火車的决數天天减少，夜車早已經停開了。聽明的讀者，習到這地方，不用說巳經知道星洲被工潮龍　着，點氣也吐不出來。</p>
<p>市政局　七部門</p>
<p>去冬十二月一有五名吉寗寗名華工，給市政局主席一封呈文，要求主應於兩星期內（即一月十日以前）答覆，否則將由有關之各工聯會採取適當之動作。工人們提出二十條件，其中主要的條件是：普通勞工，照現定薪金加一倍；每逢星期日假期，薪金照發，每星期日開工，則應發加倍之薪金；補發三年半佔領期問之新金；凡勞工由市政局辭職或被撤職者，即應發給其工作時間應得之優慷金；應儘早供給有水電之適當房屋與勞工居住，每兩名獨身同住一房，每一家眷佔用兩房；凡勞工無宿會供應者，應每月發給十元津貼金。</p>
<p>一月八日，主席答覆請願書，除說各代表們沒有禮貌外，特建議請願人應本身申請註册或加入正式之工聯會，並提出在任何時間可與市政局各委員認為滿意的代表各部門工友利益之工聯會共同磋商？磋商之後，市政局才給他們詳細答覆。</p>
<p>十三日，各工聯會臨時秘書致市政局一封信，大意說各工聯合會準備共同對論工人的苦况，而達到互相諒解，並非擬進行威脅或無議貌，對於主席之答應準備討論他們的苦境，表示喜悅。</p>
<p>次日，市政局主席在回信裏邀請各工友注意，於十二月廿八日當原來之請爾書呈上之時，只有一位華人工友前來，於一月十一日晋見之時，並無華人代表到塲。又說，如各位可保證各位之工聯會為正當組成，而且各位註册之申請書巳在職工會註册官討論之下，則本人與市府議員可詳細答覆各位之二十條件，但目前仍須仔細研究，未便遞爾答覆。</p>
<p>十九日那福氏以市政局工友七個工聯會永久中執會秘書名義，致函市政局，大意稅市局生席使用外交規避方法。規在雖延長往返函件磋商，也沒有多大用處，所以迫得作最後一次通訊，要求於一月分日下午五時以前答覆，否則委會將實行罷工。在按照和平方式進行罷工期中，當局不可以下列方法打擊罷工。（一）僱用日本戰俘以代替工人；（三）僱用屬於敵對工聯會的工人；（三）取消罷工者的米牌；（四）收回工人之宿舍；（五）以警察千涉工友的和平集會；（六）罷工期間停薪。</p>
<p>現在罷工巳經多日，雙方僵持不下，要滿意解決，恐怕還需相當時間。</p>
<p>電車煤礦　工潮繼起</p>
<p>市政局七部門的工友罷工，已經使星洲的行政當局感覺頭痛，但是，一波未平，一波又起，電車工潮一觸即發·工友限寶方於兩日內完全答覆，否則即一致實行罷工。</p>
<p>電車工潮以背景比較複雜。原來電車工友分為三種：（一）司機；（二）售票員；（三）檢查員。有一决售粟員舞弊，給檢查員打罵。售票員不服，連絡司機們共同向經理控訴，最重要的條件，是要求檢查員向售票員道歉。經理因為公司組織和地位關係，拒絕這種要求，售察員和司機們懷恨在心，所以這次勞賣談判決裂後，勢方議決，資方必須圓滿接受工人之十五項條件，否則即將實行能工</p>
<p>星洲的工潮沒有解決，馬來亞的煤炭工潮已經起來。據吉隆坡確息，馬來亞只有足供十天應用的煤炭。眼如馬來亞煤炭公司下蘭於二月八日以前恢復生產相當煤量，各種公共事業如電力及火車將致全部停頓。</p>
<p>馬來聯邦礦商會已請求政府從速向外輸入煤炭，並稱取有效步驟，以恢復煤炭生產。礦商方面對於政府因煤荒而採取之藪格限制用電，深為憂處，因此將使錫礦過去獲得政府行款，以使早日復與的事情，　　　　　　有。</p>
<p>日戰俘派用專</p>
<p>自罷工以來，工人到處請人捐助生沽費，要求警察不要干涉，這一點已經做到，但政府却運用一種法賓，以日本戰俘來代替工人。目前星洲市區內的淸潔衛生的工作，全是日本戰俘代勞。日本戰俘上身是赤裸裸的，有的鼻子上蒙着衛生罩，他們很和順地晉人家倒垃圾。有人給他們一兩支香烟，他們稱道不置，滿口「阿里阿多』。至於吉隆坡，最近已有二百多各日本俘虜，被調至煤炭山服務。道個數日日內還會漸次增加。政府為維持煤炭生產，已決定請外來勞工服務。</p>
<p>前途危機　及早解決</p>
<p>平心而論，自世界大戰結束後，到處都不平靜。遠東紛亂，歐洲也紛亂。中國不安，南洋也不安。過去十七月間，星洲政府以全力雜持金融，屬行配給，撲減黑市，使物價天天下跌，這種努力是可　佩的。但是，目前星洲的物價至少比較戰前高漲兩三倍至五六倍不等，工人們的薪水並沒有比例地增加，他們生活痛苦，騷牢滿腹，一經　動！工潮一乏不可收抬。去年年底，星洲的商店有二百多家關門—打破紀錄—現在生意也很平淡。星洲政府要獨善其身，恐怕不大容易</p>
<p>至於僱用日俘中以代工人，這是權宜的處置，星洲政府並不可以這辦法為得當。工潮如遲遲不能解決，工人為衣食所迫，挺而走險，那種危險是不堪設想的吧。</p>

<h3>臺灣的公路　吸收內地遊客·流露瑞士氣息</h3>
<p>— 臺北八日航訊·本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>到台灣來的渡海各，沒一個不感到交通旣　利又舒適，尤其是公路，坐在寬敞的座位上，眺覽著海島的景色，沒有像上海軋電車那樣困迫的情形。台灣，畢竟還保持着她的恬靜。安謐。</p>
<p>主席夫婦去年到台省，在到基隆去的高級路面上，四十分鐘間。劈面駛過八輛新式的公共汽車，他頻點清頭、他目覩了接收以後交通加速度的進展，表示欣慰。</p>
<p>基北綫上　十分鐘一班</p>
<p>沒有到過臺灣的，決不會設想到海導卻有那樣廣大的交通綱。從蓋隆到台北，目前主要的客運，全賴公路，自晨至晚，每隔十分鐘就有一輛堪以容納三十二個人的車輛駛開去，道是一條從港口到省都的交通孔道、在寬敝的油光的洋灰路面上，以七十喁的速率往返載運着旅客。</p>
<p>茲隆，它已決定為華南的轉運港，沒有「水老鼠」，出貨快，有倉惲，運費廉，美國的貨運將以此為據點，分送香港，廣州各地，　隆的被重視，已可看到台省被繁榮的近景，這條二九·八公哩的路綫，它決不會沒落，只會勃興！</p>
<p>通車里程　一千餘公里</p>
<p>記者記取光復初時公路又通，全省僅有二四九公里通着車，每月行駛六萬車公里，目前全長一千餘公里的環島綫，都已通車，目前通車里程對逹到一千一百十五公里，平均每日行駛一三·三四六·六車公里。這是本省公路交通的空前進步。</p>
<p>台省在交通方面，堪以稱公約是公路綫的密度，遠較國內任何一省為大。全省除鄉村公路外，已經元成的幹綫及支綫，違五千餘公里，照全省三萬六千方里計算，平均每七方里約有一公里弱，這是台灣的優良的交通基礎。</p>
<p>白手成家　建設的模範</p>
<p>去年八月一日成立的公路局，因為接收時車輛奇缺，來源困難，修復不易，給予該局以莫大的困難，結果終於向台銀借款分批向美國訂購了新車底盤三百輛，陸續的配合起來，現在有新舊車一一二輛，行駛全島。</p>
<p>華局長籌嵩對記者說，本省公路里程密，蒸礎好，但公路局幾乎是白手成家，政府沒一個錢，不得不向銀行借，現在就是以每天的盈餘逐月償還，這是公營事業的便利。據悉三月間還有一批可容四十二人的新車三十八輛運到，加人行駛，這將是旅行者的一個喜訊！</p>
<p>女售票員　揩油送法院</p>
<p>維持公路父通的各段站塲，全部有員工六九三人，內中有一二一的司機，他們都有嫻熱的技術，最高的待遇是每月底薪一百元，津貼二干元，另有里程工資二千二百元。公路局都　有女售票員，都是本省的少女，她們每月能掙五十元，（二十倍又給）另加津貼和動勞獎金的二千元。</p>
<p>客運每天可收入三十六萬元，據悉揩油風氣，也已開始流到了海島，但公路局對這個食小利的舉措，是繩之以法的。已經有幾個售票員因售票揩油而被送選了法院。</p>
<p>環島通車　富瑞士氣息</p>
<p>公路局現在正籌辦貨運，以短途運輸為主，以補鐵路的不足。尤其是內地需要的燃煤每月需運六萬噸，現在省內的運輸不足，僅能運送三分之二。目前維持省內貨運的，是由官商合辦的七家汽車貨運公司經營，有貨車四八八輛，承運着土產，如木材，青菜，藥材等。</p>
<p>在計劃實現環島幹綫通車逹成每月行駛一百萬車公里（每日三萬車公里）以外，該局積極與鐵道峯辦環島旅行聯運，這是藉臺灣的氣候風景招攬遊客的措施，交通各部門現均在這個目標下努力着。</p>
<p>台灣，最近將流露出瑞士的氣息。</p>
<p>交通行政　比日本人好</p>
<p>記者寓居北投，離省都一二·四公里，早晚搭乘着採取靑天白日滿地紅為標給的新福特車，單程十三元，以二十分鐘的時間，從溫泉區帶到工作的市區，人們都說車子輕快靈便舒適，都在不忍回憶在上海搭乘那樣堆區像沙丁魚，遲綏得像蝸牛的交通工具。的確，公路局以空前進展的寨實答復了懷疑內地工作人員能力的疑間。</p>
<p>台胞們都笑着設：公路交通辦得此日本人好。而在旅客方面，也維持着日本人排隊的方式依次購票，秩序并然，這種生活形態，在揚葉日本精神之點，也是值得考慮的。</p>

<h3>淮陰　蘇北政治重心</h3>
<p>— 本報淮陰四日訊　泰縣記者凌松壽</p>
<p>「韓信誠」，「袴下橋」，作爲一個二千多年以前的一位偉大人物的故鄉，兼且是濱海數百里「淮鹽」的集散地的淮陰。在記者的想像中，是一座樸實而富庶的城市。</p>
<p>可是這一個幻想，被面前的現實打破了。現在的淮陰，已不是一座如想像中的那樣古樸，而是空虛的，貧乏的繁榮。</p>
<h3>寂寞的運河</h3>
<p>在城北的中山路和城東的中正路上，你可以看到許許多多的高樓大厦——其中包括銀行，飯店，旅館……及其他。一堆堆的糖果攤，擺在街頭，花花綠綠地在誘引着人們的注視力。綢布店的玻璃橱中，陳設着最入時的衣料。玻璃雨衣，玻璃皮包，在百貨商店中也可以找到。</p>
<p>可是，假如你獖到淮陰的裏層去看看，你將會驚異這遝河畔的重鎭，竟然就這樣地沒落下去了</p>
<p>淮陰八年來的敵偽搜刮，和一　年間共軍的破壞，使這一座城市展開牠命運上最困苦的一頁。本來是「淮靈」的一個唯一的集散地，現在因爲運鹽河的不通，和演海產鹽區的荏苻未靖，所以淮陰的食鹽還要仰給於揚州和皖北的供給。</p>
<h3>省政府設辦處　不啻打了補血針</h3>
<p>爲了配合蘇北局面的開展，江蘇省政府在淮陰設了辦公處。這對淮陰的繁榮上，宛如注射了一針補血針程度。不說別的，現在在淮陰設置的黨，政，軍，團，以及其他法團會社的分支機構，就有五百多個單位。縣政府爲了應付這般機構的來來往往，你結束，他開辦，已經是精疲力竭。最近中央銀行分行，和高等法院分院就爲了屋子問題起了爭執，要請縣政府解決。縣長縐着眉頭說：「一個是國家最高的金融機構，一個是法政機關，請問，我好說誰的不是？」</p>
<p>大刦之後的淮陰，已經是乾枯了的淮陰。現在，且拿出證據來</p>
<h3>牛搶光　以人力耕田</h3>
<p>淮陰全縣能耕種的土地，計有一〇七四三五七畝，因土質關係，稻的產量是零，其餘糧食出產的比率如下：麥佔百分之五十，豆子佔百分之二十，雜糧佔百分之一十，其他佔百分之十。而現在行政力量能控制的不到百分之六十。（全縣境能控制的地區佔百分之八十五。）直到現在爲止，淮陰之食糧還要仰給於外埠。</p>
<p>這些田畝是不是都是能耕種的呢？那又大成問題。記者在一家理髮店中，聽理髮匠吿訴我：他的家在洪澤湖邊，那邊附近的田，每年夏天以後，都要受洪水的威脅，運氣好的，第一期農作物（冬天下種的）收割好了，水才到，運氣不好的，乾脆浴沒，顆粒無剩。就以收到的而論，收成都已大减，已往每畝田能有五六斗出產的，現在只有一二斗了。最嚴生而可慮的問題，鄕村中經過共軍的蹂躪後，人跑散，牛搶光，（共軍運輸工具缺乏，大半搶民問的耕牛去利用。）去年竟有以人力來耕田的，想不到農事工具一向落後的中國農村，還要倒退到原始的步驟上去。至於運河水災，自從導淮人海之後本未可以安心了，却不料共軍在臨退的當兒，決堤洩憤，阻礙國軍推進。道一個缺口有一百五十公尺長，能淹沒的田畝有三千五百餘畝，冲去食糧四千餘石。連合其他損失，估計的達國幣一〇一五七五〇〇〇元。淮陰城收復後，隨即加以搶修。</p>
<h3>縣財政寄窘　共軍公糧派用塲</h3>
<p>在這種性况之下，縣財政的困難自處不言而喻。自治稅損自從去年十一月十五日開征，每月僅能有八百餘萬元的收入——其中沒有房指在內。房捐今年開始征收，預計這一季可以征足二千萬元，但是開始沒有好久，就來了問題。房捐征收的多少以房產的價値爲準，於是奸巧之徒，不免利用時機，大施伎倆，弄得老百姓叫苦連天，記者在浴室中親眼看到一位保長與另外一個人講斤頭。記者曾以房捐問題詢之黃縣長，黃縣長對我這樣說：「我也不大淸楚，大槪總是　上面的章程辦理吧」爲了不要辜負收復區人民對政府的期望，爲了不要辜負政府對收復區人民的德意，記者願意提出來希望有攔方面能够注意注意這些不太小的事件。</p>
<p>縣政府窮，窮得連共軍丟下來的公糧都派了用塲。共軍丟下的小麥九〇一二四斤，玉蜀黍二〇七〇〇斤，就用以充作全縣一百二十六名警察的伙食。</p>
<p>地方報待辦　敎育界可憐</p>
<p>說來眞敎你不陰以一個軍政要城，到今日爲止，還沒一張地方報紙。人們聽消息，除了道聽塗說而外，只有等待五六天前從上海來的報紙。報紙不能出版的原因，除去經濟上的爲難而外，聽說還有其他種種的困難。直到記者離開淮陰時，據關係方面稱：一切問題都已解決，機件鉛字也已運來，不日可以刊行問世了。</p>
<p>至於敎育呢，更是可憐。全縣小學有一百三十四級，敎師一百人，學生四千四百人。中學一所也沒有，蘇寗分署會撥了賬粉六千袋給縣政府，以三千袋舉辦縣立中學，三千袋舉辦縣立醫院。雪白的麵粉袋，記者看見很整齊地堆在縣政府的大禮堂中。據說縣立中學可以於下個學期開學，縣立醫院也可於短期內成立。</p>
<h3>收復區行政問題　人財丙項最困難</h3>
<p>前面曾提到鎭保長和房捐的問題，記者與第七區紀專員毓智談到了這一方面。紀專員說：「收復區行政上最感困難的除去錢而外，便是人的問題。而這兩種因素，又是相反相成。地方上能做事的，經過戰亂之後，死的死了，落水的落水了，還有被共軍强迫地帶走的，流亡在外埠的人，只要能够生活，誰還想早點趕回來受罪？以致今日在地方上做事的，僅是淘汰下來的一批，（常然，其中好人也有，壞人也有。）但是，處於今日的局面下，你明知道他行罵不檢或是效率太差，而你想另外再去找一批人來，那簡直是不可能。固爲人來的事，總不能枴腹從公，你沒有報酬給他，使他生活安定。在這種情况下，有人才還不容易羅致，何况沒有人？」紀專員是黃埔三期畢業生，戎馬半生，爲人挺豪爽，這一段話，的確揭出了當前收復區行政上最嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>王廳長公璵是蘇北灌雲縣人，對記者列舉了推進蘇北收復區行政工作的要點六項。即：（一）解決經濟與人才之困難，（二）人治與法治並重，（三）認識困難，克服困難，（四）確保治安，（五）接收良心，（六）認淸現實，把握機會。此外，王廳長並向記者談到了蘇北的土地問題，他的意見是：「蘇北人稠地狹，平均下來，每個農民僅能有四畝田，如何能在不妨礙農民的生活條件下，來順利地推行土地的改革，是一件値得注意的事。要之，其唯一的要點，則在能因時地制宜，把握住這千載一時的機會。」</p>
<p>徐州綏靖公署副主任李吉甫將軍，是一位百戰沙塲的名將，這次，爲了就近指揮，李將軍特坐鎭淮陰。承他在百忙之中與記者作了幾分鐘的談話，向記者稱：「蘇北殘匪，肅淸工作，有賴於民衆自衛武力的早日完成。民衆自衛武力完成時，則匪類必然肅淸，地方秩序也隨之而安定。」李將軍最後說「無論怎樣，政府總必須使收復區的民衆有飯吃」。當此朔風怒號，霜雪交加之際，李將軍這兩句話，將帶來無限的熟力給予收復區的老百姓！</p>

<h3>黨德失學青年呼籲</h3>
<p>我是湘西常德城一個十八歲的失學靑年，自日人侵略我國，獸蹄所及，靑年皆受到了失學的厄運。民卅二年冬，常德城也遭了同樣的蹂躪，才受着中學敎育的我，亦被捲入了失學的漩渦。我國抗戰八年，全民幸賴蔣主席領導，終於獲得勝利了。世界戰爭雖經解決，但我國我創鉅痛深之餘，這副復興建設的沉重擔子，壓在我們靑年的肩頭。可是共黨不肯放下屠刀，復興建設到處遭受阻撓，我們雖抱極堅强的意志，負起創造新中國的使侖，却獲不到一些出路。因此我們來一個呼籲，要求共黨不要再用武力奪取政權，還軍於國，讓國民政府積極從事復興建設，使一大羣失學失業靑年，獲得出路。否則共黨便是叛國行爲，是人民的公敵啊！（常德靑年楊三林）</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>桐花寒節憶平陵</h3>
<p>— 魯莽</p>
<p>這幾天正是江南「桐花寒」的季節，比殘冬臘月還冷。屋子裏生不起火，出門沒有皮衣，又不時襲來使人「心冷」的消息，豈但蕭瑟，戰慄不已！</p>
<p>讀春秋，忽然看到王平陵兄的大作，不禁感慨萬千而又悠然神往。人情常向熱處流，即文人也便如此，在我們這邊的各種標榜上，已不提到「王平陵」三個字了，這位有三十年文壇歷史，苦鬥一生的人物。但也好，平陵兄正僻居山城，自求多福，並不願跟銅筋鐵骨的好漢們赤膊肉搏，而是過着無牽無掛，無爭無求的生涯。</p>
<p>重慶，這遠遠的山城，在我的筆底下，是煩囂醜惡的，讀過「重慶八年」的江南朋友，恐怕不會有什麼好感，但是看了平兄陵「美麗的山城」，連我也覺得悠然神往。這是由於社會變動的關係，正如一個村姑，布衣靑絲，有她本來的風姿，一旦改裝，往往庸俗不堪，重慶作爲戰時首都時，萬流競進，忠奸並列，小小山城，擁擠不堪，自然有許多看不慣的人，看不慣的事；復員以後，又自必返璞歸眞，退居原位。然而我們這裏却萬頭叢簇，摩肩擦背，因爲又屬於被爭之市，被爭之朝，更顯得煩　醜惡，頭昏腦脹了。平陵兄在思念故鄉中逗起美麗的回憶，因此提到「春秋佳日，紅杏花開，綠楊啼鳥；西湖畫紡，玄武靑蓮，樓霞紅葉，鄧尉臘梅，」而艷羨還鄉者的幸福。我是還鄉最早的一個人，不但又以夾在爭奪名利的人叢中爲苦，而且一年半來，未嘗領略棲霞紅葉，鄧尉臘梅，玄武靑蓮，乃至六橋三竺的勝景，爲什麼呢？「勝利」以來，不但絕無承平的景象，而且戰亂紛紛，民不聊生，便無此閑情逸緻，遊山玩水的資斧，江南雖好，又何異塞外？還鄉雖早，更了無意義。因此深感旣有今日，何必當初。「何必當初」之感，我在前年的「春秋」上，早已感過，只是現在嗟嘆益甚，感喟益深罷了，不滿現狀，便多回憶，戰前的一切，現在想來，固屬處處可愛，事事可貴，即戰時重慶的一切，也比現在差强人意，不像現在這樣的無一是處，難怪不以重慶爲可愛的我，現在又與平陵同調，十分愛慕重慶了。重慶四郊的景物，平陵兄已說過，不再贅述，但我一想起平陵所住的南山，那又不能不重複一提：</p>
<p>我們在長江邊上，或是市丙高處，總看見南面的一排大山，峯巒起伏，蒼翠欲滴，老君洞一帶的高大樹木，以及廟宇浮圖，處處引人人勝。我住在浮圖閣下足足四年，工作繁忙而生活簡單，精神感到疲勞時，便駐足壩上，注視流水悠悠的長江。視綫越過長江，再凝神遠眺南山：天期氣淸時，浮圖廟宇歷歷可數，霧中，層峯隱約在望；月夜，濛濛中知有仙境在前，便更想起二十年相交的好友。他住在「半山」的「李莊」，茅舍三　，窗明几凈，北望都門，不被名利所動，時時守着布衣的崗位。抗戰初期還常常進城參與文化界的集會，後來這些集會也少見他的踪跡了。他祗在半山讀書作文，的確，王平陵是沒有什麼野心企圖，與仳無爭，與人無忤的文人。有人認爲王平陵無用，缺乏鬥爭的精神，那完全是戴着有色眼鏡的看法，王平陵具有傳統的中國文人的精神，何必東施效顰，動轍鬥爭？工平陵更不想以文藝爲進入仕途的敲門磚，不像有些人斤斤冀獲得社會賢達的職銜。無可吾認，王平陵在當年是替政治出過力的，但當時不過是一種美意，並無企圖，力出過了便算了，人家沒有答謝他，他亦沒有介意，現在五十幾歲的年齡，由於體力精神，以及看破紅塵，再替政治服務的美意也沒有了，許多人還在催他下山，他是不會再下山了的，他說過：「今年新春，多承江南朋友萬里寄書，探問歸期，那一片殷勤的盛意，縱能挑逗我的遐，但引領東望，不知人間何世，還是在高高的山城，靜觀正在演變的世態。」平陵，　超乎物外，潔身自好，終老山城，除非朋友們不相信我的話。</p>
<p>桐花寒節，苦憶故人，草此聊　蕪箋，並博進珊兄一笑。</p>
<h3>愛情即生命</h3>
<p>— 陳因譯</p>
<p>十九世紀的時候，有一位皇帝作了一個敎育測騐，他想試試看一個小孩如果不去敎他，他將說什麼話——是古代語，是拉丁語，是希臘語，還是自己的方言。</p>
<p>他便收養了一些初生的孤兒，叫保姆們用心撫養着，但有一個命令是不准她們在嬰兒而而說話或表示任何情感。結果這些嬰兒早早地便都死了，據說道是因爲「他們得不到育養人的溫憲和愛撫是不能活的。」</p>
<h3>白象</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>六年前我曾經送過一隻小白象給一個朋友，那時自己還只是不解風情的孩子，雖然感情是聖潔的，而我却沒懂得那點可貴的感悄。年華隨着歲月增長了，如今對那年少的夢寐反到覺得可愛而珍惜起來。最近我却常常懷念着那隻小白象，懷是懷念一個遠離的戀人。</p>
<p>每當黃昏的夕陽在窗前搖曳的時候，每當我貪有落日的胭脂艷紅的時候，回憶總誘我步入故舊的庭院，讓我摸撫着金色的溫暖……</p>
<p>是初夏的時光，初夏的陽光正輕盈的照耀着窗外的綠葉，室內一片幽淸。在一個靜謐的午後，我作了一次別前的拜訪。——這次的會晤成爲我記憶中一枚晶瑩的貝珠，明亮的，淸晰的，這是我生活册頁上的一條夢痕，將留存到我生命的末日。</p>
<p>那難忘的午後，輕輕的，我懷有少年輕愁的情緒，走進葱翠的庭院，步上白石的台階，綠紗窗裏我看到了嫣然的笑，悠閒的氛圍裏使我忘却了煩憂，忘却了那點借別的輕愁，兩個年輕的孩子就像那掛在窗前的，綠絲籠中一對黃色的小雀，喁喁的，喁喁的談着，笑着，談得那麼多，那麼遠，忘情了明天將有一隻就要飛出去的。也許正是少年不識愁滋味的時候，沒有記起明天就是別離的日子，也沒想到關山將阻隔了我們，更沒了解別離將在生命中塗上一抹凄惘，不可填補的永恒的空虛……</p>
<p>悄悄的，時光從我們絮絮的話語單逸出，而自已依舊是漠然的。當晚霞落上窗口的時候，雖然有無盡的依依，但是誰又能留得住誰呢？也只有欵然而別了！朋友以一本「貴族之家」給我做記憶的箱籠，——那冊綠色的書，深深的潛藏了太多的縈思，而當時我沒領悟到這些。——走出了小園的重門我又走回去，我讓一隻小白象——玲瓏的飾墜做了我朋友的侍者。</p>
<p>後來有人問起我白象的象徵時，我的純潔使我感到些微的羞感，心的奔馳，我隱瞞了愛戀的感情，我佯說我不懂。從此白象成了我困惑的秘密，爲什麼那時不擒住易逝的靑春，和隱秘的感悄呢？六年了，許多風雨和晴晦，許多笑顏和眼淚，我承受了太多的風塵，生活讓我學會了隱藏和僞飾，也讓我懂得珍重年少的澀情！</p>
<p>別離使我們的距離遠了，而歲月使我們心的距離更遠，我沒有巫杖可使我招回教盈的靑春，也不能喚回那失落的夢寐，是智　令我國　自己的感悄嗎？抑是愚味？而今我惦記着那隻小白象，是當我駕着記憶的羽翮飛回那葱翠的庭院時。而今我有淡淡的悒鬱，我有淡淡的懷憂，我將會因思念的憔悴而哭泣嗎？……</p>
<p>現在，我時常想起那隻小白象了，我想起賦與的感情，六年來，我的小白象是否做了我忠實的使者？是否依然平安的被藏在那　細的小厘子裏呢？</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　182</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>可是近衛就那樣肯聽鶴見的話？這一着也在我們意料之中。所以鶴見同時還得密電靑木長老，請他注意華北這一個未來的慘劇。並且請他迅速挽救這一大刦，替日本軍人，也可留些名譽。這兩通密電，統由駐東京的「〇十二」負責。</p>
<p>同時，我們預算近衛的指令，也許不會來得這們快，所以除了鶴見本人那封假傳的「聖旨」之外，又呌「〇十二」再米一道「聖旨」直接發給松井，必需在九時左右達到，作爲鶴見私人密電的印證。這們一來，不由得松井不相信，也更不由得仙不照令實行。</p>
<p>本來日本軍部的組織，極其嚴密，參謀本部的機精，尤其緊湊，憑着什麼，就能讓鶴見這麼小小的人物，如此任意施爲；要發電就發電，要僞造命令就偽造命令？</p>
<p>這一點，我們用不着過事疑慮。也不能太看輕了鸛見這個小小的秘密組織。鶴見的這個組織雖小，在報吿秘密消息上，却扼住着日本特務工作的咽喉。雖然不能把握全部的報吿，但百分之若千分，總可以抓在手裏。况且我們計劃的這一套，正是應用近衛那種虛偽心理佈置的，事前事　，不僅難得發覺些微痕跡，就算他本人，得到了一些些影響，却因這件指令的內容，很合他的意旨，也許不願追究；還要認爲「先得我心」哩。</p>
<p>况且，我們埋伏善靑木長老的一股潛力，近衛遲早必要發出「攻心爲上」這道命令；所差也就只在「時間」一點上。照我們理想，這個時間上的差別，最多也不過七八十個鐘頭罷了。這幾個鐘頭相差的小事，在「〇十二」手中，極其容易彌縫。日本自從對大陸發動侵略戰以來，一日二十四小時，明電密碼，一秒鐘也不曾停歇過，誰有這麼空閒，來校對這樣一點差別？</p>
<p>觀見單身出伐，一面探聽敵悄，一面還要應松井的的，去尋覓吳鼎元，順便還得偵查一下，他們究竟拘禁了多少所調「不穩份子」；被拘禁的究竟是哪一類的人物；拘禁的地點，及看守力的厚薄，也得察看明白，以便突擊。</p>
<p>以上這一步驟，必須在十時以前完畢。第二個步驟，即計劃的主要點—突聲—，預計十時半左右動手，十二時左右完成。突擊目標，第一即解放明暗兩種被拘禁的「不穩份十」，第二即示威。但不主張過分流血，以免激動敵寇的獸性在，破壞了苦心進備的「假傳聖旨」作用。</p>
<p>突擊的進退方式，完全依照耀羣的修正提議：一，原定的指揮組，因須减去敵方集中攻擊目標，改作零星指導站，每站一人，設在來去的要路口，用各式化裝作爲擁蔽，如夜市小販，車夫，乞丐，巡魯，等；進時指點去路，退時指點歸路。</p>
<p>二，行動組不用大隊人馬，改爲狙擊單位，每單位三人，用三角斥堠遞進方式進擊或撤退；單位多寡，根據鶴見偵察所得的報吿來規定。</p>
<p>三，掩護隊原定十隊以上的汽車手提機槍隊，在行動中心的外圍佈防，以備掩護行動隊的進擊及安全撤退。這一點，耀羣認爲目標太顯，雖有强進强退的示威作用，但刺戟性太大，或許要引起敵寇大規模的搜索；我們的隊伍和車子，不難脫身，可是一經敵寇的大隊搜索，全城仍舊要鬧得馬仰人翻，鷄犬不寧了。</p>
<p>耀羣的提議，乃用「倒掛剌」小組方式，每二人爲一組。行動小組如被追擊，倒掛刺小組則在敵後狙擊，作爲「牢製」掩護。這種小組，埋伏的地段，必須是際暗的活衛街口，分開左右兩邊潛伏不致受人包圍。撤退仍舊可用汽車，却是四面散置。沿路當然佈置着指遵哨崗，以便指引進退。</p>
<p>其他各種突擊的佈置，如哨探，口號，符記，崗位，接應，掩護，突變措置，效果偵察，等等，仍舊遵照　君的計劃。</p>
<h3>小說的禁黜</h3>
<p>— 振之</p>
<p>清代小說的禁　，從一六五二年到一八六八年的二百十多年問，先後共有十次之多。這十次是：（一）順治九年（一六五二）；（二）康熙四十八年（一七〇九）；（三）康熙五十三年（一七一四）；（四）乾隆元年（一七三六）；（五）嘉慶七年（一八〇二）；（六）嘉慶十五年（一八一〇）；（七）嘉慶十八年（一八一三）—以上均見俞正變「癸已存稿」卷九；康熙五十三年的一次，又見劉廷璣「在圈雜志」卷二——（八）道光十四年（一八三四），見鄧之誠「骨董瑣記」卷三；（九）道光二十四年（一八四四），見道光刊「勸毀淫書徵信錄」；（十）同治七年（一八六八），見同治「江蘇省例」。這十决的禁黜，前八次是由淸庭的論旨，後二次由地方當局所主持。道光二十四年的一次，是浙江士紳張鑑等呈請，附有書目一百二十種。同治七年一次，則由江蘇巡撫丁日昌發起，書目先後兩批，查禁的小說共一百五十四種，是以道光的書目做根據，另外又增加了三十四種（又附淫詞唱太書目一百十種）。</p>
<p>但小說的禁黜，並非從淸代開始，明代中葉已經做過一决。「日知錄之餘」卷十二「禁小說」條引一實錄」說：</p>
<p>「正統七年二月辛未，國子監祭酒李時勉言：近有俗儒，假託怪異之事，飾以無根之言，如「剪燈新話』之類。不惟市井輕浮之徒，爭相誦習；至於經生儒士，多舍正學不講，日夜記憶，以資談論。若不嚴禁，恐邪說異端，日新月盛。惑亂人心。乞敎禮部行文內外衙門及提爾學校，僉事御史幷按察司官，巡歷去處。凡遇此等書籍，即令焚毀。有印賣及蔽習者，問罪如律。庶俾人知正道，不爲邪妄所惑。從之。」</p>
<p>按正統七年壬戍，是西歷一四四二年。早於順治九年，的二百十年左右。所引的「寔錄」，似是「正統實錄」，手中無「大明實錄」，未能一檢這項原典。</p>
<p>這次所禁的小說，所知道的也只「剪燈新話」一種。明初，中葉通俗小說還不十分發達，嘉靖以後纔日趨繁盛；初中葉所流傳的大抵是傳奇文的一類。這類小說上承唐人傳奇的餘波，近受元宋梅洞「嬬紅記」等影響，流風日甚；及至瞿佑「剪燈錄」，「剪燈新話」，李禎「剪燈餘話」出世以後，更變本加厲，倣效的也接踵而起，如趙弼「效　集」，周禮「秉燭淸談」，邱濬「鍾情廢集」，盧梅湖「懷春雅集」等，到嘉靖，萬層問和通俗小說並肩而行。正統間查禁的「剪燈新話」，就是這類「才情小說」的代表者。</p>
<p>明淸小說的禁黜，略如上面所說。但元代有無查禁的事呢？按「元史」卷一百五「刑法志」第五十三，刑法（四）禁令說：</p>
<p>「諸民間子弟，不務生業，輙於城市坊鎭，演唱詞話，敎習雜戲，聚衆淫謔，並禁治之。」</p>
<p>這禁止的是演唱詞話，不是禁黜小說的書籍，兩者是逈然有別的。就現在所知，還沒有足够的文獻能說明元代也有禁黜小說的事。</p>

<h3>借債的哲學</h3>
<p>— 氣樓主人</p>
<p>有一位大學敎授講窮人的做人之道，他說第一要勤於理髮，第二要竭力避免借債。前者我沒有十分遵行，後者我却的確是十分「竭力」了的。</p>
<p>自然，對少數不會以借錢敬而遠「我」並且輕視「我」的人，我是有時要借錢的，有時僅僅爲了手頭要寬裕一下，我也曾向朋友借過錢。這些朋友了解我，他們的友誼並不築在「錢」字上面，借錢在他們眞是看作友情之中應有的事，因而有時我問他們借，有時他們也向我借，借了也一定還。</p>
<p>至於另外有一些人，他們彷彿一看見我就預料我要向他們通商似的，處處在經濟上與我劃出鴻溝，隨時隨地怕我看見他們兩張以上的鈔票，對於道樣的人，我就依照老師所說的話，絕不開口向他們要求一點通財之誼，因爲他們所看見我的祗是一個「窮」字，沒有一個「急」字，那怕我有天大的急需，在他們看來祗是窮相而已。他們是救急不救窮的。</p>
<p>當避難在鄉的時候，我曾經身陷在一個窘境裏面。那時與我同避鄉間的富戶很多，在混亂的局勢之中，日夜有搶刦發生，我雖窮困，却有城裏人的身份，因而隨時也有被覬覦的可能。某日當着若干地病流氓之類的面，我不能不使一點手腕，說我日子難過，要向某某人借錢去了，這某某人有勢有錢，他是不會有人敢去動手的。</p>
<p>過了幾天，我偶而逛到他那邊去看一個朋友。他一看見我，連臉色都變了。我立刻知道了他的心思，覺得非向他解釋一下不可。我吿訴他我　决說借錢的話（這時候他的臉色更難看了），無非是使用陳平退盜的妙計而已。此話一說，他的臉上眞像雨過天靑一樣，立刻堆出由衷的笑容，這是我在他臉上從來沒有見到的興高彩烈的神氣。</p>
<p>老師說不要向人借錢的哲學，這是最好的例證。你看不向人借錢，可以使人家多麼快活！</p>
<h3>小遊丁湖湖城隍山</h3>
<p>— 梅山</p>
<p>來到杭州，將近一年，早已就知道城隍山〔吳山〕的熱鬧，可終未能光顧，近來物價高漲，心境更加惶悚，木身職務，又在半停頓的狀態中，胸膈間老覺有一股悶氣，就於午後帶着一顆沉重的心悄，踽踽獨行，逛到了城隍山。</p>
<p>由淸和坊大井巷進去，就是入山頭門，踏上一層層碎磚舖的山徑，走到了城隍·太歲·和老東獄等廟，烟霧迷漫，香火絲繞，弄得那些崢嶸惡像黑頭黑腦，更覺可怖，城隍廟前一片廣塲，可以憑眺全市，鱗决房屋對着一泓湖水，整個的天堂景像，瞭如指掌。</p>
<p>再過去是三忠祠和七七紀念壇。壇內豎着「火牛刦」三字石碑一座，據解是爲紀念敵寇侵略者。「火牛」就是代表「丁丑」年，可是將牠位置在抗禦洪楊的三忠祠旁。總覺有點不倫不類。</p>
<p>山上唯一的特色，除了廟宇破舊，烟火鼎盛外，要算卜筮星相家之多了。杭州號稱「佛國」「天堂」，這也許就是「天堂」中的活神仙。</p>
<p>這年頭，的確眞呌人祗有「問蒼天」「信鬼神」他們大概也就抓住了這一點，在拼命的賣弄玄虛，大談哲理，對準了你「升官發財」的僥倖心理，高論他們的一套妻·財·子·祿。我一處一處仔細看過，顧客中雖多是中年以上的生意人，不用說那是在新正問「財」，但也儘有那穿着皮毛大衣的儼然貴婦，和洋裝畢挺軍服整齊神氣活現的靑年們，聽他們揣骨，摸手，來判斷你終身榮苦。</p>
<p>帶來一顆沉重心情，回去却同樣的迷惘，「天堂」不能與塵世　離，當然也只見這批問卜的人，在問財求色了。</p>
<h3>筆記與學生　授敎</h3>
<p>— 念茲</p>
<p>因爲有事搭乘徐家匯的二路電車，至呂班路上來二位像生意人模樣的人，他們從天氣哈哈扯到中國的敎育問題，又由中國的敎育問題縮小談到中國的敎授。在下身爲學生，當然立即聚精會神，洗耳恭聽。</p>
<p>一頭戴羅宋帽的說：「啊呀老兄！你不要以爲敎授難當，其實拆穿了說眞是一文不值——，簡直是架留聲機。今年捧着道本筆記一字不改的抄在黑板上，明年還是照樣拷貝，後年當然不會例外的如法泡製……。過了若干年，人家已經發明了一套新的理論，而那位大敎授還是將一貫的老調灌輸給學生。學生連上課都懶得去，只曉得借上一班的筆記來死啃。本來是一門有研究性的科目，現在變成像私墊裹『三字經』一樣的死東西了。聽說有一個大學開了一門名爲「近世物理的科目』，顧名思義，它一定包含着近世最進步的理論，上了幾課以後，一位好事的學生，在各方調查之下，發覺抄下來的筆記眞是那敎授求學時代所收藏着的東西，如果要標以年月，那已經有二十七年歷史的古董了。我可以斷定，再隔二十七年，只要這位敎授不告老還鄉，他的唯一法寳，一定還是這本一字不改的筆記，眞是寃曲了這『近世」兩字……。」</p>
<p>另外一位有着深度近視眼的，笑着說：「哈哈！他們有着大道理的，譬如有人問你剛才所提到的敎授，爲何近世物理找不出一些『近』的蹤跡？那他一定會帶美議諷的口吻說：所謂近世物理者，不過是從原有的舊　　　所推演出來的新理論而已，　　是一樣的，你們只夠資格　　　礎……。」</p>
<p>戴羅宋帽的忽然不耐煩了，大聲說：「算啦算！敎學生死哨書也罷，擺大架子也罷，總之是學生倒霉。老實說：能夠講授一本倒退二十七年的老筆記已經算媽媽虎虎了，疑問的是他那木筆記或許已經是數十年的祖傳了。」</p>
<h3>投稿人</h3>
<p>— 果華</p>
<p>有一位先生寄了許多幽默故事給一家報館，後來編輯先生寫了一封信給他：</p>
<p>「親愛的先生：你的稿件我們收到了。有些笑話我們曾經見過，有些笑話我們至今還看不出來。」</p>
<h3>燕語鶯歌消人悉　—衰敗潦倒鳥集之二</h3>
<p>— 朱光</p>
<p>在滬戰前，甚至十二月八日太平洋戰爭之前，外洋進口的珍奇禽獸原也不在少數。比較名貴的飛禽大抵都來自遇邏，安南，馬來亞，荷屬東印度，南洋，以及南北美洲，而以香港爲其總彙。此外日本來的亦復不少。據那位鳥行的老　說：安南暹邏一帶料哥，因爲生性靈巧，在短期內可以學會各種方言。其在語言上的「天才」，實遠較拙於辭令的人類爲高。國產的百哥，天質伶俐者，亦能學取簡單的語言，不過這些所謂「名種」最近來不僅沒有進口，就連國內（如山東河北等產地）也很少運來。難怪那位老闆感慨地說：「眼前來貨之少，簡直不及戰前百分之一」了。</p>
<p>佈下羅綱　鳥類的捕捉方法，倒也頗爲有趣，除了生性馴良的如芙蓉，綉眼之類大抵都出於拾卵孵之外，有所謂「天羅地網」，（用巨大的活動網羅）。有所謂「高黏棒」，捕捉麻雀之類，大抵都用二三丈高的棒杆，上着膠質的漿水，伸棒兜黏。有所謂「踏籠」，這是一種結構非常精巧的活動籠子，中間放着作爲誘致其同類的「停鳥」，下層置有活動窗口四扇，專捉小型的鳥類，下端裝着大型的活動踏板二方，這是專爲蛟大的飛禽如「百哥」「盡眉」之類而設的陷阱，浙江杭紹一帶，又有所謂「連環籠子」那是因爲活動踏板能作自動的迎續性的陷阱作用而命名的。上述種種，大抵都是國內獵鳥者經常施用的手工業式的捕鳥方法，至於南洋與國外，那就不得而知了。</p>
<p>此外也有採用麻醉術的法以白米浸入烈性酒液中，放在預置的空場上作爲引餌，鳥類一經下嚥，便爾醉昏，聽憑擺佈，但這只能說是原始的土法子了。</p>
<p>一般玩鳥者的興趣，除了對它們外形如羽毛色澤「身段」軀幹等的愛好之外，主要的是欣賞這些小動物的振翅抖翼的小動作和它們清脆悅耳的叫鳴聲。熱中於鳥癖者，莫不以偶爾一次的「大叫」爲快事。俗語說燕語鶯歌消人愁，大槪就是指這一種境地。所謂「大呌」，據說是鳥類在興高采烈得意忘形時的高聲大笑，至呢喃啾囀之音，祗是人類的喁喁私語，那便不足稱道了。</p>
<p>體貼入微　就爲的要博取這些「媚人」的動作與「悅耳」的「大呌」，玩鳥者對他們飼養着的鳥兒，莫不作體貼入微，愛護備至，其小心翼翼鞠躬盡瘁的態度，委實遠在侍候生身父母之上，祗少也該不在照顧其最最得寵的愛妾之下。他們處心積慮地爲這些小動物安排飲食冷暖，箟梳沐浴，乃至不惜從各個角落，趕到跑馬廳畔，一言樓上，參加鳥集茶會，爲他們心愛的費貝兒覓取夥伴，免除其獨處籠中的落寞寡歡之苦。在跑馬廳畔，好些提鳥籠的朋友，都是由曹家渡，徐家匯，楊樹浦趕來的，更遠還有來自浦東和漕河涇等上海郊區的呢！</p>
<p>根據非正式的統計，大牴北方人喜歡玩武鳥，南方人則喜歡養文鳥，蓋亦兩地民性使然也。至於名貴的鳥稀如紅嘴綠身的　哥以及其他歐美與南洋的珍禽，通常都是達官豪富的大戶人家作爲他們富麗堂皇擺設或裝飾之用的，以愛好的程度論，那當然與上述那些嗜鳥成癖的朋友不可同日而語了。</p>
<h3>「四川風土畫」：戴大草帽的四川女兒。</h3>
<h3>收緊空聨語</h3>
<p>— 春</p>
<p>前天在報上看見金息侯輓小名旦李世芳的聯云：「自天降禍」「萬世流芳」的渾然可愛，不禁想起了詩人徐志摩乘機失事時，某君輓以聯云：「一飛冲天，三人同命」，「五體投地，四大皆空」允爲確切。又王長春晚徐聯云：「四大竟皆空，下瞰塵褒畫芻狗」。「浮生眞若夢，上窮碧落即黃泉」，則更感慨系之矣。</p>

<h3>再論「郎心如鐵」</h3>
<p>— 嗎博良</p>
<p>煤氣燈搖晃的空曠的古屋裏，灰茫茫的霧掩過來，再散不開了，結成那麼的陰暗，陰暗是沉鬱的，處處有一聲悶住的呼呌，陰冷的爐邊，凝固的黑影，潮濕的街道，寂靜的堂韓，旋轉的樓梯，屋背的履音，壁畫裏的人也　着謀殺的眼光。是這種詭秘的氛圍，顯出一個弱女子的驚惶，孤單，神經刺激，也是這種氛圍使人覺得嫁夫如此，直令女子寒心了。在　造濃都的色澤這層說起來，導演喬治寇格無疑是成功的，繼「茶花女」「鑄情」「小婦人」以後他又立下了一個新的里程碑。因爲看過「情海妒潮」「狂戀」，我們覺得夫婦之間謀殺案的心理故事，原來並無意義，如今更成爲老套了，「郞心如鐵」的超特完全由於導演的處置於演員的演技。以靈活的鏡頭，喬治寇格一直描寫到靜默的高潮，他沒有像一般導演那樣正面拍出爭鬥，保存文藝氣息的述貫，他總明地廠用音響略過打架塲面，但是此外他不知何故連高潮的發展也一筆勾消，以致結局是急轉直下了。</p>
<p>最可觀的還是殷格　曼的演技，這是每位電影觀衆必須一看的，老實說，「卡薩布蘭加」「聖瑪利亞的鐘聲」中殷格　少有建樹，「情海妒潮」且無成就，這還是第一次她讓我們看到她技藝的無敵，難怪她以此獲得一九四四金像獎，也難怪她自以此片爲得意之作了。以前看「女人面孔」，深覺瓊克勞馥的沉毅，不可多得，現在始知殷格蘭比她還多一份曼妙溫婉，最近看「風流種十」，覺得奧麗觀哈佛　了解中年商界婦女，扮演三種年齡的心景無不逼眞，後半部哭罷當着合尚子爵以手捧臉，純然出乎靈性，令人叫絕，但說到奧麗薇整個演技，自已總像難下定論；而股格麗褒曼在此却是令人奄不遲疑加以歡呼的，她不但將鉀經過度刺激童致衰弱成症的人的心理逐步刻劃入微，表達出恍恍惚惚乏弱如夢如癥的悄况，鑒琴時的翻翔起舞，樓吻時鵝頸的手臂，交出畫輻後樓梯哀求時失望的手勢，那種政作都有非常燆捷壟逸的和諧美，如一支低乘的花，台詞也唸得徐疾皆有節律，有些明星可以追到她的深刻，但往往顧此失彼，不能齊全。因此，我敢說，股格　　曼這一决已經把「居禮夫人」的葛麗亞嘉葉打倒了，</p>
<p>我忘不了片中「夏季最後的玫瑰」一曲，美好的少女俱是玫瑰，但躡玉踐花的人卻是夏天以後的秋天，玫瑰遇不得和天，一過乙衰殘了。「郎心如鐵」的實拉幸好沒有過了秋天，猶在夏季一吐嬝後的芬芳。</p>

<h3>Great Battle in Central Shandong Lasted Three Days and Nights; National Army Making a Strong Counterattack; Situation North of Jiaoji Railway Improving</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 23rd] The great battle in central Shandong, around Laiwu, Tushikou, and south of Boshan, has lasted three days and nights. Chen Yi personally led 150,000 communist troops, consisting of thirteen divisions, six garrison brigades, eight independent regiments, and local forces, to launch a full-scale attack on the National Army. The National Army, personally directed by Wang Yaowu and commanded at the front by Li Xianzhou, engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat, unprecedented in scale. Casualties were extremely heavy, with fighting continuing fiercely as of noon on the 23rd. The Qing Shikan Pass south of Boshan is a key objective, with smoke screens and artillery fire filling the sky, visible even from Boshan city. The communists apparently aim to seize the Zibo mining area after the fierce battle at Laiwu. The National Army is sending reinforcements, strengthening its position, and expects to repel the communist forces within days. In eastern Shandong, at Shahe Town and Huibu in Laiyang County, the National Army's Huang Shu division fought fiercely against the encircling communist forces for five days and nights, and had driven them back by the 23rd. In recent days, communist troop movements around Jinan and elsewhere have been extremely busy, with constant harassing attacks on the National Army. A full-scale war in Shandong appears imminent. The Jiaoji Railway's Mashang Station is now safe, and traffic between Jinan and Zhangdian, as well as between Zhangdian and Boshan, has resumed.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] The communist attempt to attack the Jiaoji Railway from both the north and south in Shandong has failed. Chen Yi's remaining forces, numbering seventy to eighty thousand, have been launching relentless attacks northward from Laiwu and Tushikou towards the Jiaoji Railway. The National Army is putting up a staunch defense, and had routed the communist forces between Tushikou and Qing Shikan Pass by the 23rd. The main force of Chen Yi's remaining troops has now moved from Sishui to areas west of Laiwu. More than ten thousand communist troops in Zhangqiu destroyed the railway near Mingshui on the night of the 22nd, and the National Army is currently driving them away. The communist 11th Division, with more than eight thousand troops, infiltrated Jinling Town east of Zhangdian from Boxing and Gaoyuan northwest of Linzi on the 22nd to sabotage the railway, but has been driven back by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 23rd] The communist forces attacking from Boshan split into two groups on the morning of the 23rd. One group attacked Black Mountain, seven kilometers southeast of Boshan, while the other attacked Xijiao, the location of the largest coal mine in the Zibo district, seven kilometers east of Boshan. After a valiant defense by the National Army, neither group had made headway by evening. Furthermore, the communist Fourth and Ninth Divisions and the Second Garrison Brigade, gathered around Taohua and Qing Shikan Pass, about nine kilometers west of Boshan, attempted to attack Boshan from the west, but the National Army is on alert. The communist forces attacking Shahe Town, after being repulsed by the National Army, received reinforcements of three regiments from Gaowang Mountain, twenty kilometers south of Laiyang, on the evening of the 22nd, and fierce fighting is again underway.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] The great battle in Jiaodong is in full swing. A portion of the National Army that broke out of Laiyang County has joined up with National Army reinforcements along the Jiaoji Railway, and is attacking the communist forces along the Jinling Town line east of Zhangdian. The fighting north of the railway is extremely fierce, and it is expected that the situation in the area will improve in two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] According to transportation sources, the Jiaoji Railway has been damaged in approximately thirty locations by the communist forces. Many sleepers have been burned, and the rails have sustained significant damage. The communist forces are currently damaging the rails by placing small, yellow explosive charges at the rail joints and detonating them.

<p>Corpse Mountains Outside Laiwu City; Boshan and Mingshui Remain Safe</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 23rd] The focus of the war has shifted to central Shandong, with the Laiwu offensive and defensive battle as its core. Chen Yi personally led over 150,000 troops from thirteen divisions, six garrison brigades, and eight independent regiments, attacking the triangular area between Laiwu, Boshan, and Mingshui. Nearly half of these forces were used to attack Laiwu, indicating Chen Yi's obvious intention to concentrate superior forces, gain the initiative, and strike at the National Army field forces heading south from Lai and Tai, in order to secure his base area in the Yimeng Mountains. However, Commander Wang Yaowu, who is directing this campaign, anticipated this early on. Before the communist forces launched their offensive, he shortened the battle lines and concentrated his forces near Laiwu, dealing the communist forces a major blow and initiating a large-scale battle, the largest since the Battle of Xuzhou. Since the evening of the 20th, the battle has raged for three days and nights. The communist forces employed the inhumane flesh-shield tactics of the Middle Ages, launching wave after wave of dense attacks. Laiwu city was once in grave danger, but thanks to the personal command of Vice Commander Li Xianzhou, one of Shandong's famous "Three Lis," who calmly maintained control, the situation had stabilized by noon on the 23rd, although it remained tense. The communist forces have suffered heavy casualties over the past three days, with mountains of corpses outside Laiwu city, creating a sea of blood. At Tushikou, a key town north of Laiwu, the National Army, with a small number of troops, resisted over twenty thousand superior communist forces. Although the southwestern part of the town was breached by the communist forces, the northeast corner is still firmly held by the National Army. Overall, the National Army is resisting communist forces several times its size with limited forces. Although it has also suffered losses, all sides have unconditional trust in General Wang Yaowu's outstanding leadership and firmly believe that he will be able to overcome the current difficult situation, linking up with the National Army in southern and northwestern Shandong to deal a decisive blow to the communist forces in eastern Shandong. The calm and normal state of affairs in Jinan and central Shandong, which has not been shaken by the blockade of the Jiaoji Railway and the city becoming an isolated island, is the most powerful evidence of this.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] Chen Yi's communist forces in southern Shandong have retreated into the Yimeng Mountains, using the Mount Meng area, covered in Masson pine, as their base. Their strength is no more than fifty thousand. A portion, thirty thousand, has infiltrated central Shandong, while the communist forces that have invaded the area east of Zhangdian along the Jiaoji Railway also number thirty thousand.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 22nd] The National Army at Qingshi Bridge, Dazhai, and Heiyu west of Boshan, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, withdrew to more favorable positions on the morning of the 22nd to continue fighting due to overwhelming enemy numbers.

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 23rd] Communist forces have been spotted twenty li northwest of Jiutai. It is speculated that the communist forces may be planning a larger-scale operation. Fierce fighting is expected in Chengzi Street and Jiutai.

Communist fortifications have been built at key locations along the north bank of the Songhua River, covered with snow and branches. Heavy communist forces are stationed in the area from Shushu County and Tuanshanzi to Xiushuidianzi and are continuously gathering troops along the banks of the Songhua River, apparently with the intention of invading the south at an opportune moment.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is reported that communist forces in the area north of Huadian are currently attacking Hengdaogou and Jinshazigou with a force of approximately five thousand. A portion has infiltrated the Yimianpo railway southeast of Shuangcheng Town. The National Army is currently dispersing to suppress them. Several hundred communist troops are carrying out raids in the area of Fulongquan and Sanshengyu. Since the 18th, two communist brigades have launched a fierce attack on Guzi Mountain and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. The communist forces have announced that they will mobilize twenty regiments to launch another offensive in the area between Yongji and Dehui. The communist forces that have infiltrated south of the river amount to eight regiments.</p>
<h3>Passenger Transport Resumes Between Kaifeng and Minquan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] The repair work on the Bianxu and Xuhai sections of the Longhai Railway is underway. Under the personal supervision of Deputy Director Wu Shi'en, who rushed to Xuzhou, the daredevil repair teams are working day and night to overcome the difficulty of insufficient sleepers using the "seven instead of twelve" method, an economical approach that saves labor, materials, and money, and is unprecedented in the history of Chinese transportation. The repair work on the Xuhai section is also proceeding smoothly and is expected to reach the Grand Canal within a week. However, the full restoration of the Xuhai section is not expected until June of this year due to extensive damage to the steel rails.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 23rd] Passenger and freight transport on the Bianqiu (Kaifeng-Shangqiu) section of the Longhai Railway has been suspended since the communist forces harassed and damaged the line.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd] After the cessation of gold trading, the market in Chengdu was quiet for a time. In the last two days, black market trading has been detected again.

<h3>An Economic Expert Discusses the Price of Xincao Currency</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] After the price of gold was changed to 480,000 and the price of U.S. dollars was changed to 12,000 yuan, some people believed that the price of gold was too low, which would put some people who bought gold with their hard-earned income for fear that the legal currency would continue to depreciate at a disadvantage. When reporters asked an economic expert about this, they were told that changing the gold price to 480,000 was related to changing the exchange rate to 12,000 yuan. Although this number is very different from the past 7 to 8 million, gold is ultimately a luxury and not a daily necessity. Those who hold a small amount of gold will not endanger their livelihoods even if they suffer losses. The government's purpose is to crack down on large households, so it cannot be blamed for improper government measures. After the U.S. dollar is changed to 12,000 yuan, the import of foreign goods can be slightly reduced. Other countries have also adopted this policy.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Imports of Hemp and Hemp Bags</h3>

At a price of one U.S. dollar per bag, the import quota is at most just over 1.2 million bags, which is not enough to meet the national needs.</p>
<h3>Joint Supervision Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd] Liu Houwu, the Joint Supervision Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, recently issued a written statement on the incident in which Feng Chenggong, manager of the Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank, refused inspection, detailing the circumstances of the incident. The statement cited Feng's reasons for refusing inspection: "The Central Bank is a national bank and has a major mission. Unless a formal letter is first notified and the bank requests instructions from the headquarters, it does not dare to expose any situation within the bank without authorization." In his statement, Liu pointed out the illegal aspects of Feng's case and said: According to the regulations, it is permissible to notify the police to enforce the blockade, but fearing that it would affect other public financial businesses, he sent a telegram to the Supervisory Yuan for instructions in order to be cautious. Yesterday, he received a telegram from the bank saying that if there are any inquiries in the future, it is hoped that a formal letter will be prepared and that the facts will be answered truthfully. However, many days have passed and the situation has changed. Even if another investigation is carried out, it is difficult to obtain the truth. He has submitted another report to the Supervisory Yuan for instructions.</p>
<h3>Collecting Information on the Dalian and Lüshun Issue: Foreign Minister Wang Departs Beiping for Shenyang, Will Return to Nanjing After a Three-Day Stay in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 23rd] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 24th to collect information on the Chinese Changchun Railway and the Dalian and Lüshun issue. There are rumors here that Wang will go to Moscow, and that the Soviet Union will send people to the Northeast to negotiate with Wang. According to someone, these two statements are unreliable.

The speaker, when discussing the Chinese Changchun Railway, stated: According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, two three-person committees were established: one to handle the valuation of the Chinese Changchun Railway, and the other to draft detailed rules and regulations. However, no formal meeting has been held to date. Of the three representatives sent by China, it is said that two went to the Northeast for inspection and held informal meetings with the three Soviet representatives. However, because there were only two people and one was missing, and the materials and documents were also incomplete, the results were not satisfactory. The two people have been dismissed, and no one has been sent again yet.</p>

When the reporter inquired about the issue of attending the North China Pacification Area Political Conference, Bai laughed and replied that whether he would go had not yet been decided.

<h3>Beiping Municipal Government Actively Preparing to Supply Daily Necessities to Public Servants and Teachers; Executive Yuan Has Given Instructions on Three Major Principles</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Director Xie Huishou of the Social Affairs Bureau recently told reporters: The municipal government is now actively preparing to supply the daily necessities of more than 100,000 public servants and teachers in the capital in the shortest possible time. The Executive Yuan has given instructions on three major principles for this measure: (1) Common problems of the supplied agencies shall be managed by the Executive Yuan; (2) General problems between material supply agencies and sales agencies shall be managed by the municipal government; (3) Individual problems between material supply agencies and sales agencies shall be the individual responsibility of the supply agencies. According to these three major principles, the municipal government will only handle general administrative and daily affairs. It will not handle the issuance of vouchers or the distribution of funds and materials, and the division of powers and responsibilities is very clear. As for the distribution method, cooperatives will be fully utilized, and several stores will be specially contracted through trade associations to become sales stores. In this way, every public servant and teacher can be conveniently located near their residence to purchase the inexpensive supplies they need, without the cumbersome procedures of the past rationing system. The government does not need to add a large number of personnel, saving expenses. This is truly an advanced method derived from experience.</p>
<h3>Anti-Chinese Sentiment in the Philippines Intensifies; Immigration Director Drafts Notice; More Than 6,000 Overseas Chinese Will Have Difficulty Returning to the Philippines</h3>

Approximately 6,580 overseas Chinese are affected by this notice, and the other foreigners affected are approximately only 100 Spaniards.</p>

<h3>International Emergency Food Committee Allocates Siamese Rice to Our Country</h3>
<p>We Will Send Ships to Collect It Ourselves</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 21st] According to Xiao Songqin, our representative to the Siamese Rice and Food Joint Committee, only 3,000 tons of the 25,000 tons of Siamese rice allocated to China by the International Emergency Food Committee for the first half of this year can currently be obtained. The main reason is that the transportation situation is poor, which has delayed the rice being sent to Bangkok for milling. It is learned that 16,400 tons of the 30,000 tons of rice originally scheduled to be distributed to China in the second half of this year were later allocated to Malaya, India, and other parts of Southeast Asia for some reason. This rice will be returned to our country around March of this year, but since UNRRA is now reluctant to be responsible for transportation, it may be transported by our country sending ships to collect it itself.</p>

<h3>Simplification of Procedures for Reporting Compensation for Wounded and Deceased Officers and Soldiers; Standards for Special Compensation to Be Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] In order to simplify and clarify the procedures for reporting compensation for wounded and deceased officers and soldiers in various units, without the need for repeated transfers, so that the officers and soldiers can receive compensation benefits as soon as possible, the central government has specially stipulated that the units in charge of reporting compensation cases should instruct the relevant units to follow the following methods: A. For the Army: (1) The division and independent regiment/battalion units will be the reporting units, without the need for transfers or separate filings. However, compensation cases for personnel of colonel rank and above will be transferred by a higher-level agency. (2) Higher-level command units above the army will compile and handle compensation cases for their subordinate units. (3) Compensation cases for officers and soldiers of security teams will be reported by the Provincial Security Command. (4) Compensation cases for officers and soldiers of conscription agencies will be reported by the Provincial Military Management District. (5) Compensation cases for officers and soldiers of units under the fortress command will be reported by the respective fortress commands. B. Compensation cases for wounded and deceased naval officers and soldiers will be reported by the Naval Headquarters. C. Compensation cases for wounded and deceased air force officers and soldiers will be reported by the Air Force Headquarters. D.

All applications for compensation for the wounded, deceased, or missing (captured) officers and soldiers of the above units and agencies should be sent directly to the Fuxu Office of the Joint Logistics Headquarters for prompt review and approval. For those who have already submitted applications for compensation, a list should be compiled and registered, distinguishing between those that have been approved and those that have not. If a compensation application form has been submitted but no reply has been received for a long time, the date and document number of the registration should be used to request expedited processing without submitting another application form to avoid duplication. It is also learned that, in view of the recent general increase in prices, in order to take care of the living conditions of the families of wounded and deceased officers and soldiers, the authorities have obtained approval from Chairman Chiang to increase the standards for special compensation for division and regimental commanders, with 30 million yuan for division commanders and deputy division commanders killed in action, 20 million yuan for brigade commanders and deputy brigade commanders, and 10 million yuan for regimental commanders. The standards for other ranks are also under review.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Treasures Are Rare in the World</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 23rd] The richness, variety, and quality of the products in the magnificent mountains and rivers of Northeast China are unmatched not only in other parts of the country but also in the world geographically. Forests, minerals, agricultural products, and fisheries are all abundant. The great rivers and mountains also have unique and rare products that are famous far and wide. The Changbai and Xing'an mountain ranges are home to lynx, black foxes, sables, and other animals, whose fur is highly valued by people around the world. The precious medicinal materials, such as ginseng, deer antlers, and frog oil, are sold throughout the country and are unparalleled tonics. Among them, frog oil is made from frogs collected from mountain springs. Its flesh is full of oil and white as ivory, making it particularly rare. The Songhua River is extremely rich in fish, including carp, bream, mandarin fish, perch, and various freshwater fish. Even in winter, when fishing through the ice, every net is full. Whitefish and carp are especially famous and were tributes during the Qing Dynasty. Tourists who come to Jilin now all enjoy them and praise them. Pearls are also produced in the deep waters of the lower reaches of the Songhua River. The Qing court even established an official to manage this. However, due to years of war and displacement, all industries have declined. Rare furs, except for old stocks, have long disappeared from the market. Although the price of sable fur has reached 800,000 yuan (all in Northeastern circulating currency), it is still difficult to buy. Old mountain ginseng costs 18,000 yuan per mace, cultivated ginseng costs 1,500 yuan, deer antlers cost 15,000 yuan per tael for high quality, 9,000 yuan for medium quality, and 7,000 yuan for ordinary quality. However, wild ginseng and wild deer are mostly produced in the mountainous areas controlled by the Communist army, and the supply is extremely scarce. Therefore, there is more cultivated ginseng on the market. Many farmers in Wula Street and the surrounding villages of Jilin raise deer, so the supply of deer antlers is still available. The main production areas of frog oil are the humid mountainous areas of Huadian, Jiaohe, and Panshi. Currently, about 1 million frogs can be harvested each year, with each 100 frogs yielding one catty of oil, priced at 7,000 yuan per catty. The fish production in the Songhua River, in Jilin Province alone, used to be over 10 million catties per year, supporting about 10,000 people. There were also fishing organizations, but now they are all scattered and sold without statistics. The Jilin Provincial Construction Department is planning to carry out large-scale fishing and breeding in reservoirs next to the Xiaoxingman Power Plant. The lowest price for fish is 100 yuan, and the highest price for whitefish is 300 yuan. Pearls are produced in Ningjin, Heilongjiang Province, which has not yet been recovered. The people are struggling to survive and probably have no time to explore. As the saying goes, the "Three Treasures of Jilin" are ginseng, sable fur, and Wula grass. This is actually a wild plant that grows everywhere. After drying, it is long and soft and is used to fill leather shoes, making "Wula shoes" that keep warm and prevent moisture. People rely on it to get through the icy and snowy winters.</p>
<h3>Case of the Destruction of the Suzhou News: Each Side Holds Its Own View</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Education Department Will Send Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] Regarding the issue of the Suzhou News being destroyed by students from the Suzhou Provincial Women's Normal School, Provincial Chairman Wang telegraphed the county government to earnestly mediate and expressed his regret for the students' emotional impulsiveness due to a lack of rational control. He deeply hoped that the students' emotions could be transformed from conflict to harmony in the future. However, during the investigation by the county government today, both sides held their own views. The Suzhou News believed that the news had been corrected several times, and the students' request for an apology and the surrender of the reporter exceeded the scope of the publication law. When the matter was still under discussion and had not been rejected, the students destroyed equipment and paper, which was clearly a planned action. The students from the two schools believed that protecting the school's reputation was a matter of course, and even if the actions were inappropriate, they should not be regarded as excessive. Therefore, this case will probably have to be directly discussed by the provincial party headquarters and the education department before it can be resolved satisfactorily. The education department has decided to send personnel to Suzhou on the 24th to thoroughly investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>Haining Jue-Character Seawall to Be Repaired with Concrete</h3>

<p>It is heard that the National Direct Taxation Conference, in its project of opening up new tax sources, has discussed the levy of a one-time property tax. We have not yet seen the contents of the proposal. Whether it will be passed or not, and whether the government will approve its implementation after it is passed, are still unknown.</p>
<p>At present, finance is extremely difficult, and banknotes have to be issued from time to time to make up for the deficit, resulting in unstable phenomena such as currency inflation, high prices, and high wages. In order to alleviate or stop these phenomena, it is theoretically indisputable to use other methods such as increasing taxes to replace them. However, the levy of a one-time property tax has too many drawbacks and is too difficult to implement, so it is necessary to carefully review it.</p>
<p>First, there is too little basis, that is to say: the targets of taxation are too scattered and too general, and there is no complete material to rely on. Not to mention movable property, even immovable property is easier to handle, no more than houses and real estate. Everyone knows that now the most unfavorable and the most disadvantaged are the landlords. Their various taxes are constantly increasing, while their income - rent - is subject to various restrictions, even to the point that it is not enough to cover expenses, let alone profit, so that the construction industry has completely stopped and the housing shortage is serious everywhere. In this state, if a large exploitation is added ruthlessly, is it reasonable? Is it fair?</p>
<p>The land originally had land tax, and since the military uprising, countless surcharges and apportionments have been added. The general farmers have long felt that harsh government is like a tiger, and there is no way to go. As a result, the wasteland is increasing day by day, and the countryside is drastically declining. The central government knows its suffering, so after the victory, it immediately ordered the exemption of land tax for one year, and repeatedly issued orders strictly prohibiting apportionments. Although it has not been very effective in practice, it can also prove that their burden has really reached the point where it cannot be increased. What's more, after the war, many counties have lost their nationality and cannot be sorted out for a while. They have to use rough and ready methods such as declaration or mu donation to levy taxes arbitrarily to temporarily relieve the urgent need. How can we add insult to injury and come up with another unreasonable accumulation to increase their burden and pain?</p>
<p>Taking large cities such as Shanghai and Nanjing as examples, there are many wealthy merchants and dignitaries. It seems reasonable and reasonable to take a one-time tax from their property to help the country's needs. Unfortunately, most of their property is gold bars, diamonds, foreign currency, antiques, calligraphy and painting, and other valuables, which are actually very easy to hide and very difficult to investigate. It is said that the estate tax has been very ordinary since it was levied. Even the families of several well-known rich people cannot collect a considerable amount of tax. It can be seen that the property tax is really difficult to handle, especially the movable property part, which cannot meet the expectations of the general public. In case we disregard the facts and resolutely implement it, it is nothing more than a great disaster for the powerless and unpowerful lower classes.</p>
<p>Second, the technique is too clumsy, that is to say: the means of collection is not high enough. Let me quote the chairman's words to prove this. In his speech on the 16th, there is the following sentence:</p>
<p>Therefore, the collection of income tax and various direct taxes has not achieved significant results. Now we should not seek precision in calculation, but instead lead to prolonged days, and we should adopt a swift and effective collection method. If this causes individuals to bear the burden, there may be an increase, then they will unanimously support the government,... and unanimously abide by it.</p>
<p>The current income tax and various direct taxes have been promoted for a long time and have already established a foundation. However, it is inevitable that they will be protracted and ineffective. What's more, the property tax is a new tax with no foundation at all. Its scope is extensive, and its content is complex, far from being comparable to income tax. Even if the people unanimously support the government and are willing to bear the burden, there may be an increase. We believe that, according to the current personnel and institutions, we may still not be able to achieve swift and effective results.</p>
<p>When it comes to taxes, the more basic the better. Even if there is a lack in theory, but it has been practiced for a long time and has become a habit. The unreasonable parts are also what we think of as opening up new taxes. It is always better to rectify the old taxes, and the most important thing in rectifying the old taxes is to remedy the deficiencies. Since the current income tax and various direct taxes are calculated inaccurately, take too long, and are not significantly effective, then the right medicine should naturally be used to solve the problem. This responsibility is irrefutable for those who handle direct taxes. It is too uneconomical to leave aside the existing taxes that can be rectified and should be rectified, and to rack our brains to find new objects that are protracted and difficult to calculate to increase revenue.</p>

<h3>Before Formal Negotiations on Amending the Alliance, Britain and the Soviet Union Seek Economic Understanding; Hope for Improvement in Current Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] According to sources close to the British Foreign Office, the Soviet Union has proposed reaching a full understanding of the world's security needs and concluding an economic agreement before amending the alliance with Britain. According to British sources, the Soviet side has proposed that the future relations between the two countries cannot be unrelated to overseas transportation, future access to raw materials, world trade, and so-called non-independent territories. It is also heard that, in addition to being willing to continue to maintain the political alliance concluded in 1942 with Britain, the Soviet Union has also expressed its willingness to adjust economic relations with Britain. British foreign affairs experts believe that the Soviet Union now has a clear sign that it is willing to obtain a full economic understanding with Britain to supplement the political alliance treaty. The Soviet Union deeply hopes that Britain will provide a large number of machines and other means of production in exchange for raw materials from the Soviet Union. Trade talks between Britain and the Soviet Union have been going on for some time, but have been stranded due to difficulties in the goods supplied and needed by both sides. The Soviet Union needs British hardware, engines, textile machinery, motors, boilers, cranes, and other heavy industrial equipment. Last December, Britain submitted a list of goods it needed to the Soviet Union, with timber occupying an important position. Although British Minister of Commerce Cripps expressed his hope that future British-Soviet trade could be fully expanded, the Soviet trade delegation to Britain has returned home for consultations. Last week, Moscow Radio broadcast in English that there is great hope for post-war economic cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, and declared that the Soviet system does not create trade barriers for any foreign economic relations.</p>
<h3>Marshall Talks About the International Situation: The World Is Still Restless and There Is No Real Peace; He Encourages the People to Work Hard to Take on Leadership Responsibilities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] Since taking office as Secretary of State, Marshall delivered his first public speech at Princeton University today, saying that the United States' leading assistance is indispensable for the restoration of peace and democratic progress in many countries. The attitude of Americans towards international affairs has serious shortcomings. He said that we have stopped the war, but there is still no real peace. At home, we are in a transition from a wartime economy to a peaceful economy. In Europe and Asia, there is still famine, and the relations between the great powers are changing. We still need to obtain order from chaos, and peace is still to be won, but how much this can be achieved will largely depend on the American people. Other countries are exhausted economically, financially, and materially. Marshall asked the American people to pay more attention to the historical perspective when considering the international situation. He criticized the bystander attitude and especially asked young people to have a real understanding of history and to develop a sense of responsibility for world order and security. When Marshall mentioned China in his speech, he only expressed his decision to celebrate Washington's birthday in China.</p>
<h3>US Trusteeship Plan: Britain and the Soviet Union Still Disagree</h3>
<p>Security Council Scheduled to Discuss the Matter the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] Informed sources said today that the United States, encountering opposition from Britain and the Soviet Union, does not intend to demand immediate acceptance of the United Nations' trusteeship plan for the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. US Representative Austin is prepared to leave the plan on the Security Council's agenda once it is submitted. However, the United States will clearly state its intention to remain on the islands. When the Security Council meets on the 25th, the United States will request that the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands be designated as military strategic areas under US administration. Britain has indicated that it will reiterate its opposition. London believes that such a step is absolutely impossible in law until the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The Soviet Union's opposition is also focused on the time factor.</p>
<h3>Pravda Comments on the Moscow Conference: Expresses Optimism About the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] Today's Pravda international commentary column commented on the upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference and expressed optimism about the future of the conference.

<h3>British Communist Party Advocates Reorganizing the Labour Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] British Communist Party Secretary-General Barrett said in his opening speech at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party today that he advocated reorganizing the Labour government to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union and said that Britain does not need a coalition government, and the Labour Party can do this work.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] The British Communist Party held a conference today and passed a motion at the closing session opposing the British King and Queen's tour to South Africa, believing that this move is tantamount to protecting Smith's government, and Smith is one of those who encroach on personal freedom and oppress non-Europeans. Another motion calls for Britain to withdraw from Greece.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of housing in Britain after the war, the government had to rush to manufacture a large number of mobile gold houses to meet the needs of the people. The picture shows the 10,000th mobile gold house handed over to the tenants by the government. (British News Service)</p>

<h3>Snow Returns to London, Fuel Crisis Worsens</h3>
<p>[London, Feb. 22nd dispatch from the Associated Press] The British government announced tonight: Snow has returned to London, threatening the British gas industry and potentially making it unsustainable. It has ordered gas companies to reduce gas consumption by 10 percent. A spokesman for the Fuel and Power Department, Mr. Nott-Bower, warned gas users: The adverse weather is extremely difficult to manage, and household gas reductions and restrictions on household electricity use may be implemented next week. Forty coal ships are blocked by wind at ports along the northeast coast, and coal reserves at major gas plants have been reduced to dangerous levels. Long lines of coal trains are blocked by snow in the north and South Wales and cannot run, with snow depths reaching 14 inches in some places. The restoration of power to factories in the central region next Monday after the blackout will increase the industrial burden on gas plants. The situation will be extremely serious in the next 48 hours. The government has ordered gas companies to reduce coal use by 10 percent, effective for ten weeks, continuing until May 2nd. According to a report from an official of the British Mineworkers' Union, thousands of miners are willing to work extra hours on Sundays.</p>

<h3>British and American Occupation Authorities in Germany Arrest a Large Number of Nazis</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, Feb. 23rd broadcast: British and American authorities today arrested a large number of Nazis in their respective occupation zones in Germany, including ten who are notorious remnants of the Nazi party. It is said that in the past few months, these Nazis have been constantly active, with the aim of spreading Nazi propaganda and restoring political power. They have declared five goals: (1) to prevent the dismantling of German factories for reparations; (2) to release imprisoned Nazis; (3) to completely prevent German coal from being shipped out of Germany; (4) to halt the socialization of Germany's major industries; (5) to support the movement to return East Prussia and Silesia to Germany.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of the Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany</h3>
<p>— Special translation by this newspaper's translation department</p>
<p>The author and a friend, accompanied by a Soviet guide, made a thousand-mile trip through German territory under Soviet control. We visited German people from all walks of life, including</p>
<p>politicians, industrial workers, teachers, housewives, farmers, newspaper editors, mayors, and pastors. We spoke with Soviet military government officials, propagandists, and soldiers.</p>
<p>Two Basic Questions</p>
<p>The author had two basic questions in mind: First, why do most Germans think that life under Soviet rule is chaotic and miserable? Second, what is the Soviet Union's basic policy in Germany?</p>
<p>The answer to the first question is not easy to obtain. The area we passed through from Berlin to Dresden seemed very peaceful and fertile. Every piece of land was cultivated. In the industrial areas that had not been bombed, the machines were running and the chimneys were smoking.</p>
<p>Food Supply Situation</p>
<p>What about the food situation? Try grabbing a German and asking him, and he will immediately pull out his ration card. Strangely enough, the food ration here is more generous than in other parts of Germany occupied by the Allies—the Germans seem as nonchalant about this benefit as our team.</p>
<p>However, the people in the Soviet occupation zone not only do not show signs of being well-nourished, but instead appear haggard and hungry. While there are not many plump Germans in the American occupation zone, it is extremely difficult to find a German of acceptable weight here.</p>
<p>This is because in the Soviet occupation zone, the black market is almost completely non-existent. In the area under American control, anyone with money can get extra food from the black market, but in the Soviet occupation zone, people can only rely on what is rationed to them to make a living.</p>
<p>Why Do Germans Oppose the Soviets</p>
<p>The travelers, seeing the orderly situation here, seem to find the anti-Soviet sentiment of most Germans somewhat strange and unreasonable. Is it because of the Red Army's brutal behavior? The Germans I spoke with—including two old friends of the author, who certainly would not lie to me—unanimously admitted that the behavior of the Soviet occupation army was quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Germans are long afraid of the Soviet measures to eliminate Nazi forces? In fact, the policies adopted by the Soviet Union in this regard are not as severe as those adopted by the American authorities. In the American occupation zone, all Nazi party members are barred from holding important positions. But in the Soviet occupation zone, all former Nazi party members, except for a few high officials, can easily have their identities forgotten as long as they mingle with the Soviets.</p>
<p>Despite all these facts, the Germans still hate the Soviets, perhaps due to the influence of the propaganda of German Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Germans now living in the British and American occupation zones, who used to be accustomed to the propaganda that "the Russians are demons who kill without blinking an eye," think that living in the Soviet zone is a very terrible thing.</p>
<p>Conversely, in the minds of most Germans, the British and Americans are seen as kind, extravagant, and somewhat comical figures. Therefore, the Germans living in the Soviet occupation zone envy their compatriots living in the British and American zones, thinking that they are living affluent and leisurely lives.</p>
<p>The Soviets themselves cannot be excused from the creation of these many misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Even if they have nothing to hide, they often deliberately act mysteriously, causing suspicion. Now this suspicious gaze is focused on the Soviet Union's favorite, the Socialist Unity Party—a political party formed by the merger of the German Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Soviet Cultural Activities</p>
<p>Soviet policy is particularly evident in cultural activities. The Soviet authorities strive to preside over and encourage the cultural life of the Germans in the occupation zone—that culture is not "proletarian" literature and art, but German liberal culture.</p>
<p>In the many public schools we visited, we could not find any traces of Marxism. According to Professor Zock, the president of the University of Jena, the Soviet authorities gave him all kinds of assistance but did not interfere with his plans.</p>
<p>Even though the Soviets are full of anti-German sentiment, their apparent concern for German political and cultural issues seems, while not surprising, somewhat difficult to understand for people in Western countries. What exactly is their intention? Is there any truth to the recent rumors that the Soviet Union and Germany will form an alliance to control Europe?</p>
<p>Soviet Attitude Towards Germany</p>
<p>Outsiders of course have no way of knowing the Soviet Union's plans. But no matter what the plan is, the current fear of a Soviet-German bloc seems very far-fetched. The Soviet Union is currently apparently working hard to strengthen the strength of the German left wing, but it does not regard the German Communist Party as "comrades" or "allies," but only as assistants to the occupation authorities in handling administrative affairs.</p>
<p>The general German view is: Rather than fight side by side with the Soviet Union, it would be better to help the British and Americans destroy the Soviet Union. Therefore, the general Soviet view of uniting with Germany to declare war on the United States must be dismissed with a smile. Because although the Soviets hate the Germans, they do not dislike the Americans, and at the same time seem not to care much about the anti-Soviet sentiment in the United States.</p>
<p>The Germans think that war will break out sooner or later between the United States and the Soviet Union, so the Germans are surprised to see the Americans and Soviets getting along so well. But the Americans living in Germany think that the Germans' view is ridiculous. They feel that: Leaving politics aside, there is no hatred between Americans and Soviets, so why should they have animosity or fight each other?</p>
<p>Germany has suffered the ravages of war and the destruction of the area, all thanks to Hitler's long-term strategy of madness</p>

<h3>Using Loans to Buy Gold: Four United General Office Uncovers Three Companies; General and Deputy Managers of Zhengtai, Da Zhonghua, and Shenghua Factories Summoned by Military Law Department of the Garrison Command</h3>
<p>Three companies, Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Da Zhonghua Paper Mill, and Shenghua Pharmaceutical Factory, have been found to be engaged in gold speculation using production loans. After being investigated by the Four United General Office, they were handed over to the Garrison Command by the supervisory committee for handling. The military law department of the Garrison Command summoned the general manager and deputy manager of each factory at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday and will transfer them to the court for handling within days. The three factories used part of their production loans to purchase gold, which is clearly contrary to the original intention of production loans. However, it was found that the three factories purchased a total of 140 gold bars, which is only a "fly" in the entire financial turmoil.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Although yesterday was a Sunday holiday, the Economic Supervision Group continued to thoroughly investigate the gold rush. It is reported that more than 30 major players who bought and sold gold during the gold rush have been uncovered by the supervision group using the method of peeling cocoons and extracting silk, checking the accounts of banks and money houses. Among them are gauze companies, private banks, and individuals. Although they may not all be the instigators of speculation and manipulation, their buying and selling without physical gold is illegal. The most important point is that the supervision group has apparently discovered traces of collusion between officials and businessmen. These figures who collude and work together for evil are also the real "tigers," and the supervision group is determined to "fight the tigers." Therefore, it has secretly submitted a report to Chairman Chiang. The Economic Supervision Group cannot announce anything until it receives approval.</p>
<h3>Summoning Manager of Tongfengyu Gold Shop to Inquire About Allotment Process</h3>
<p>It is also learned that 60 to 70 percent of the gold released by the Central Bank after February 1st was allocated by Tongfengyu Gold Shop. Yesterday, Supervisory Committee member He Hanwen, accompanied by Yu Chao, leader of the Economic Supervision Group, and Xu Youzuo, questioned Zhan Liansheng, manager of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, at the Orient Hotel supervisory committee residence, inquiring in detail about the allotment process.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Seeks to Stabilize People's Livelihood by Forming Price Review Council; Once Assessed, Shops May Not Change Prices Without Authorization</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has now decided to establish a "Price Review Council" in accordance with the economic emergency measures plan and instructions issued by the central government. The organization of the Review Council will consist of one chief secretary and seven to eleven members. The position of chief secretary will be concurrently held by Director Wu Kaixian, and the candidates for each member will be selected by the council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, and various industrial and commercial guilds, and will be hired by the Social Affairs Bureau. The powers of the council are to review the selling prices of essential daily necessities for the people's livelihood. The review method is to calculate the cost of the goods, including manufacturing costs or the original purchase price, as well as interest (not exceeding the loan interest rate agreed upon by the local banking industry), taxes, transportation costs, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance, and other expenses. Appropriate legal profits will be added separately. Once the prices of various goods are agreed upon, each shop must mark the assessed selling price. Before the Price Review Council re-evaluates the prices, they may not exceed the limit without authorization. The council is currently actively preparing and is expected to be formally established in early March.</p>
<h3>Train Tickets to Increase in Price Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>It is reported that railway passenger and freight rates will increase on March 1st, with the increase multiplier being 50 to 100 percent.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Railway Bureau will adjust the baggage fee for passengers starting tomorrow. The fee for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines will be 6,000 yuan per ticket, and the fee for the Songhu line will be 3,000 yuan per ticket. The fee for live baggage carried by passengers will be 30,000 yuan per ticket.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities in This City Request Price Adjustments</h3>
<p>Many public utilities have recently requested price increases from the Public Utilities Bureau, citing increased costs and inability to maintain operations. Public buses and trams (trolleys and trolleybuses) of British and French companies in this city will all increase in price starting next month. It is said that the multiplier will be 100 percent of the original fare, with public buses costing 400 to 1,400 yuan and trams costing 400 to 1,000 yuan. It is also said that the Public Utilities Bureau has already agreed in principle. As for other common fees such as water, telephone, and gas, they are also under negotiation with the Public Utilities Bureau, and prices will be adjusted soon.

<h3>Import Restrictions on Newspapers Too Strict: Newspaper Industry Urgently Appeals, Demanding Relaxation of Quotas, Sending Representatives to Petition Minister Peng</h3>
<p>The government has announced the total quota for imported paper goods, and has also specified import quotas for various types of paper. Among them, the newspaper quota is very low. If paper is imported according to the specified quota and used to supply the national newspaper and publishing industries, it will be far from sufficient. Not only will the national publishing industry be affected, but the entire culture will be on the verge of collapse. The newspaper industry in this city feels that the situation is serious. Therefore, the Newspaper Industry Association convened a meeting a few days ago and decided to send representatives to Beijing to make an urgent appeal to the Ministry of Propaganda. They were scheduled to go to Beijing by the morning train today. Yesterday, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department came to Shanghai. Upon hearing the news, representatives of the association, including Li Zikuan, brought a petition to Mr. Peng in the afternoon, personally describing the suffering of newspapers, which, after being ordered to reduce pages, could not withstand further major blows. They earnestly requested Mr. Peng to immediately consult with the Executive Yuan to relax the national newspaper import quota so that the newspaper industry could continue to survive. At the same time, they also hoped that the government would investigate the paper merchants' import situation, prevent hoarding and speculation, and investigate the Russian paper that was recently imported without settlement of foreign exchange, so that each newspaper could purchase it at a fair price. Mr. Peng promised to immediately transfer the matter to the Ministry of Finance and other relevant agencies for review and resolution to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Donation Report Reader Consultation Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Coughing Up Blood</p>
<p>He Zhuyan asks: I have never had lung disease. I coughed for a month due to a cold, and then did strenuous exercise. A few days later, I found blood in my sputum. After an X-ray examination of my lungs, I found a hidden coin-shaped trace. I took Codeine and calcium lactate, and the cough stopped, but blood still comes out from time to time. I would like to ask what special medicine can stop the bleeding? Is this symptom tuberculosis?</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD] According to the symptoms described in the letter, it is feared that it is early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. Artificial pneumothorax should be performed immediately. Hemostatics such as Coagulen and cough suppressants such as Codeine can be used.</p>

<h3>The Xujiahui Observatory, with 75 Years of History</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The Xujiahui Observatory is the earliest place in China to study astronomy and meteorology, and it is also the origin of modern science in China. As early as more than 300 years ago, Xu Guangqi of the late Ming Dynasty had close contacts with Matteo Ricci and Tang Ruowang, introducing Western astronomy and calendar calculations to China, at Xujiahui. At that time, Xujiahui was just a small village.</p>
<p>Main Work</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory was founded in the eleventh year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (1872) and has been in existence for 75 years. At that time, Shanghai was opened as a port and the city was prosperous. The number of ships entering and leaving was increasing day by day. Hurricanes often caused disasters, resulting in tragic deaths. At that time, the Shanghai International Chamber of Commerce requested Father Dechevrens of the Catholic Church to set up an observatory to forecast the weather. The priest agreed, but on the condition that the telegraph bureau send telegrams free of charge. After the approval of the telegraph administration, the new-style observatory in the Far East was born at that time.</p>
<p>Weather forecasting is the main work of the Xujiahui Observatory and has made great contributions to the maritime community. In the past six or seventy years, countless hurricanes have occurred along the coast every year. The observatory's warning work has saved countless ships from disaster. They regularly connect with more than 50 other weather stations and observatories and report the weather records detected every day in four resolutions. At the same time, more than 200 weather reports are received from various places every day, and merchant ships and warships in the ocean also communicate with each other at any time. When a hurricane blows close to Shanghai, the observatory sends priests to wait on the signal tower on the outer beach to answer the inquiries of the captains. When the hurricane arrives in port, it issues a warning that can be heard very clearly on the Bund.</p>
<p>Research on Geomagnetism and Earthquakes</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory is also engaged in the study of geomagnetism and earthquakes. The records of geomagnetic changes over the past six or seventy years are all preserved there. In the 30th year of Guangxu, Shanghai began to run trams, and geomagnetic research was greatly hindered. Therefore, it was moved to Lujiabang in Kunshan County. There are sophisticated instruments and skilled workers there. In the 11th year of the Republic of China, the instruments and technicians used in the coastal geomagnetic survey jointly conducted by the government and Japanese scientists were all supplied by the Xujiahui Observatory. The Earthquake Department is still in Xujiahui, equipped with new instruments, such as the Vesic-style horizontal seismograph and the Galitzin-style vertical seismograph, which are very precise and occupy an important position in the world's earthquake community.</p>
<p>Standard Clock</p>
<p>The standard clock is also a department of the Xujiahui Observatory's work. There are two new-style chronometers installed in the basement, keeping a certain temperature and pressure. The daily error does not exceed one-hundredth of a second. At 12:00 noon and 9:00 PM, the standard time is broadcast by radio. At that time, the ships in the port can correct the time on their ships. The International Astronomical Association has designated three places as standard clock stations, and the Xujiahui Observatory is one of them. In addition to recording and reporting time, they also do research work, which started in the 15th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Sheshan's Equipment</p>
<p>Real astronomical research work is carried out on Sheshan, 15 miles from Shanghai. There is an equatorial mount with a diameter of 40 cm, which is often used to observe celestial phenomena. In the past, sunspots were photographed from telescopes. With more than 10,000 photos, the positions of 14,000 stars were determined, and the phenomena of 1,200 constellations and the Jupiter's disturbance of the orbits of other planets were studied. Calculations are more than a hundred resolutions. Sheshan's astronomical equipment is very rich and exquisite, and the work results have been well-presented because of years of accumulation.</p>
<p>Patrol Work</p>
<p>In addition to the Xujiahui weather forecast, time, earthquake research, Sheshan astronomical observation, and Lujiabang geomagnetic experiment, the work of the Xujiahui Observatory also includes patrol work in various places. Several trips were made to the interior to survey and map 54 maps in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, determining the orientation of 50 cities. The lighthouses in various coastal areas are also often inspected to check the accuracy of the instruments.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to safeguard sovereignty, the government ordered the Xujiahui Observatory to stop weather forecasts and meteorological broadcasts. This 75-year-old meteorological work will bid farewell to the outside world. However, their work will not stop, but it will not be made public. Father Long Xiangquan, who originally presided over the Xujiahui Astronomical Meteorology Work, has long been hired by the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory. In the future, the Xujiahui Observatory will still assist the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory with its power.</p>

<h3>Ma Chao Visited the Garden to Appreciate Goldfish</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Minister of Agriculture and Industry Ma Chaojun arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The purpose of this trip was to investigate the agricultural and industrial enterprises in Shanghai and develop domestic agricultural and industrial issues. Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Xi Guansheng and Lin Ruiai, a specialist from the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry, Ma Shaotang and others, he went to the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing to visit. He was guided around the farm by fellow villagers Zheng Xingbo, Liu Ling, and Xi Zaijian, and entered "Fish Swimming in the Sky" to view famous goldfish varieties. Wu Jiren, the person in charge of the fish department, told him that he planned to transport a large number of goldfish to the United States this year for sale. Mr. Ma instructed that the names, varieties, crosses, and breeding methods of various goldfish should be written in detail, then translated into Western languages, and then shipped, because the people there are not yet familiar with Chinese goldfish. Mr. Ma also said: The government can also help this endeavor to succeed. Mr. Ma then visited the factory and praised the various facilities of the factory after its restoration. Mr. Ma also told reporters that he would stay in Shanghai for three or four more days.</p>
<h3>High Court Detention Center: Like a Large Apartment, a Six-Story Building with Complete Facilities, All Undecided Traitors Enter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The site of the High Court Detention Center was originally a U.S. military tribunal. It was recently taken over by the High Court from the U.S. military, and thus established. The director is concurrently held by High Court Judge Chen Zhensheng. Underneath are one prison official, and three sections for General Affairs, Security, and Operations, as well as two offices for Medical Affairs and Education. Starting March 1st, 501 undecided traitor prisoners from the Loyal Supervision Center will be transferred to this facility for detention. The center is a massive six-story steel-concrete structure, towering in the northwest corner of Shanghai Prison, occupying a vast area. Inside, there are automatic elevators. The fifth floor has a rubber room, where all four walls are lined with thick rubber to prevent prisoners from committing suicide by hitting the walls and for detaining those with mental illnesses. The third floor has a gallows room, filled with a chilling atmosphere that sends shivers down one's spine. On the frame are three large ropes. During executions, the rope is placed around the prisoner's neck, the face is covered with black cloth, and the prisoner stands on a trapdoor. When the mechanism is triggered, the trapdoor falls, and the person is suspended in the air, dying instantly. The body falls to the lowest level and is transported out through a small door. The prison cells include single rooms and large rooms that can accommodate four or five prisoners. They are equipped with fixed bunks, flush toilets, and writing desks. A few rooms even have wardrobe facilities. The rooms have ample sunlight, and there are plenty of washrooms and bathrooms. At first glance, it resembles a well-equipped large apartment. Beside the center is a lawn where vegetables are grown, and it is also where the traitor Deng Weile Ni Hongzhi was executed. The center also has an Indian guard named Bar Sinsh, who can speak Shanghainese. It is said that he has worked in the prison for over thirty years. The building was constructed around 1931. However, whether foreign guards are needed for managing Chinese prisoners in the center is worth considering. Therefore, the issue of retaining this Indian person is still under investigation.</p>

<p>Wolf tails, produced in our country, are the main raw material for making writing brushes. Recently, due to fur exporters exporting wolf tails, which are not needed abroad, along with wolf skins, raw materials have become scarce. This forces us to repurchase them from foreign countries, causing the wolf tails exported from China to be re-imported. The repeated transfers waste time and increase prices, greatly affecting the development of our country's cultural enterprises. The Pen and Ink Trade Association of this city held a standing committee meeting yesterday and resolved: (1) to request fur exporters not to export wolf tails wastefully; (2) to request the government to prohibit the export of wolf tails; (3) to request people from all walks of life to advocate together to maintain culture.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Strictly Controls Self-Funded Study Abroad, Carefully Issues Passports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 20th Dispatch] Since the Ministry of Education held public and private funded student abroad examinations last July, the number of Chinese students going to study in the United States, Britain, and other countries has increased significantly. However, there are rumors that many students who have not passed the examinations are still able to obtain passports and go abroad for study, leading to varying levels of competence and mixed quality. There has been some criticism from the outside. A reporter specifically visited a person in charge at the Ministry of Education regarding this matter, and received the following response: After the government's victory in the War of Resistance, it opened up the study abroad policy and held public and private funded study abroad examinations. Society has had two different opinions on this: one is that national rejuvenation and construction require urgent talent, so more students should be selected to go abroad for further study and cultivate talent, and the standards should be relaxed. The other is that students must have a solid foundation in their studies before going abroad to be able to achieve something, and that the standards should be strict in order to save national foreign exchange. Some even advocate that there should be no university graduation restrictions, and that self-funded study abroad examinations should not be held. Both of the above arguments have their own merits. However, it is an undeniable fact that China's post-war rejuvenation and construction requires people everywhere. Therefore, since the Ministry was approved to resume holding public and private funded study abroad examinations, it has raised the standards for admission and strictly selected candidates. Furthermore, in view of the fact that American universities have been extremely crowded with students since the post-war recovery, in order to avoid Chinese students wasting time and money abroad, it is stipulated that self-funded students who have passed the examination must obtain an admission certificate from a foreign university before being allowed to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue a passport. Since the implementation, the review has been very strict and has never been lenient. As for the rumors that there are people who have not obtained passports for going abroad in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, that is not related to the Ministry, because the Ministry is not the only department that can request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue passports. The reporter also asked whether the government's recent suspension of issuing student passports was true. The person in charge replied that the Ministry handles public and private funded study abroad examinations in accordance with regulations, but if the Executive Yuan has new regulations, the Ministry will follow them after receiving orders.</p>
<h3>Zhengda University Faculty Association Urges Students to Resume Classes</h3>

<h3>Summary of Shanghai City's Education Statistics for 1946</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Over the past year, education at all levels in Shanghai has shown a trend of rapid progress compared to before the War of Resistance and after the victory. The restoration of public schools has been gradually completed, private schools are also gradually developing, and literacy education is being promoted in stages. Considering the population changes in the city, the surge in the number of students is truly astonishing:</p>
<p>City Overview</p>
<p>Item Before the War (June 1937) After the Victory (December 1945) Now (December 1946) Percentage Increase Now Compared to Before the War Percentage Increase Now Compared to After the Victory</p>
<p>Number of Schools 1,227 1,208 1,378 Increase of 3.3 Increase of 14.1</p>
<p>Number of Students 243,744 250,454 425,162 Increase of 74.47 Increase of 69.75</p>
<p>Number of Social Education Institutions 1,378 194 270 Decrease of 80.4 Increase of 39.2</p>
<p>Number of Students and Participants 125,756 254,126 378,858 Decrease of 67.2 Increase of 49.1</p>
<p>The total number of schools increased by 14.1%, while the total number of students increased by 69.75%, which shows that Shanghai's education is becoming more economical. In particular, after most of the national schools implemented a two-shift system, the student capacity of each school greatly increased. The details of the increase in each level of school are shown in the table below.</p>
<p>In terms of the nature of all levels of schools in the city, public and municipal schools account for 23.3% (public schools other than municipal schools account for only 1.1%), private schools account for 76.7%, municipal education institutions account for 61.5%, and private institutions account for 38.5%, which shows that most of Shanghai's school education is still run by private individuals. This is a serious problem that needs to be solved urgently. However, in terms of the number of students in public and private schools, the percentage they occupy is slightly better than the former, which also shows that public and municipal schools are larger in scale and have more capacity, while many private schools are poorly equipped and have small school buildings.</p>
<p>(2) Situation of Primary Education</p>
<p>There are 1,116 primary schools in the city, with 317,762 students. The increase before the war, after the victory, and now is as follows:</p>
<p>Item Before the War (June 1937) After the Victory (December 1945) Now (December 1946) Percentage Increase Now Compared to Before the War Percentage Increase Now Compared to After the Victory</p>
<p>Number of Schools 1,040 935 1,116 Increase of 7.3 Increase of 19.3</p>
<p>Number of Students 188,177 175,874 317,762 Increase of 68.8 Increase of 80.7</p>
<p>The number of students increased from 188,177 to 317,762, an increase of more than 68%. What is particularly noteworthy is that the number of students in municipal and private schools has become more balanced. Based on the capacity of municipal elementary schools, if the number of existing municipal schools could be doubled, the goal of having the government completely run national education could be achieved.</p>
<p>Item Number of Schools Percentage Number of Students Percentage</p>
<p>Public 2 0.1 939 0.3</p>
<p>Municipal 282 25.3 137,939 43.4</p>
<p>Private 832 74.6 178,884 56.3</p>
<p>Total 1,116 100.0 317,762 100.0</p>
<p>According to the population statistics of the Civil Affairs Bureau in October 1946, the number of school-age children (6 to 12 years old) in the city is 425,995. The number of children in school already accounts for more than 72.8%, and there are still 108,243 children who have not enrolled. Observing the trend of the increase in the number of primary school students in Shanghai in one year, these more than 108,000 out-of-school children can all enroll in another year and six months. Assuming that each class has 50 people, then 2,165 classes need to be added to enable all school-age children to enroll.</p>
<p>(3) Situation of Secondary Education</p>
<p>Regarding secondary education, there are 223 secondary schools in the city, with 79,279 students. The increase or decrease before the war, after the victory, and now is as follows:</p>
<p>Item Before the War After the Victory Now Percentage Increase Now Compared to Before the War Percentage Increase Now Compared to After the Victory</p>
<p>Number of Schools 153 241 223 Increase of 45.8 Decrease of 9.5</p>
<p>Number of Students 43,666 59,842 79,279 Increase of 81.6 Increase of 24.5</p>
<p>During the occupation period, many secondary schools were established, and the number of schools suddenly increased. After the Education Bureau reorganized them after the victory, they decreased slightly. As of now, the number of schools has increased by 45.8% compared to before the war, and the number of students has increased by 81.6% compared to before the war. Further investigating from the perspective of public and private schools, the percentage of municipal middle schools, regardless of the number of schools or students, is far lower than that of municipal elementary schools.</p>
<p>Item Number of Schools Percentage Number of Students Percentage</p>
<p>Public 3 1.4 2,238 2.9</p>
<p>Municipal 11 9.4 11,284 14.2</p>
<p>Private 209 89.2 65,757 82.9</p>
<p>Total 223 100.0 79,279 100.0</p>
<p>(4) Situation of Higher Education</p>
<p>The number of schools above the junior college level has increased significantly in this year, because most of the national schools in Shanghai have completed their restoration. As of December 1946, there are 39 schools above the junior college level in the city, with 28,121 students. According to the population statistics of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the number of people in the city receiving higher education is 70,267. Therefore, students receiving higher education in Shanghai should account for 40.1%. The increase or decrease before the war, after the victory, and now, as well as the comparison by ownership, are as follows:</p>
<p>Item Before the War After the Victory Now Percentage Increase Now Compared to Before the War Percentage Increase Now Compared to After the Victory</p>
<p>Number of Schools 34 32 39 Increase of 14.7 Increase of 21.9</p>
<p>Number of Students 11,901 14,756 28,131 Increase of 136.7 Increase of 91.9</p>
<p>Comparison by Ownership:</p>
<p>Item Number of Schools Percentage Number of Students Percentage</p>
<p>Public 10 25.6 11,719 41.7</p>
<p>Municipal 3 7.7 515 1.8</p>
<p>Private 26 66.7 15,887 56.5</p>
<p>Total 39 100.0 28,121 100.0</p>
<p>(5) Situation of Social Education</p>
<p>There are 271 social education institutions in Shanghai, of which school-type institutions account for 85.4% and general-type institutions account for 14.6%. There are 52,659 people studying in them, and 326,199 people participate in the activities of general social education institutions each month. The two items combined account for slightly less than one-tenth of the total population of the city. The comparison between public and private institutions is as follows:</p>
<p>Item Number of Institutions Percentage Number of Students and Participants Percentage</p>
<p>Municipal 166 61.5 340,180 89.7</p>
<p>Private 104 38.5 38,678 10.3</p>
<p>Total 270 100.0 378,858 100.0</p>
<h3>Confident of Winning the Group A Championship, Donghua Wins Seven Games Out of Seven, Defeats the Soviet Union 4-2, 15,000 Fans Packed Yiyuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Spring has arrived, the weather is sunny and warm, and the long-deserted Yiyuan was once again very lively yesterday. Fans jostled shoulder to shoulder, competing to watch Donghua defeat the Soviet Union. The Group A champions, with seven wins out of seven, resulted in a 4-2 victory, with Donghua leading 2-1 in the first half. Han Longhai showed his skills and scored three goals. According to statistics, there were more than 15,000 fans yesterday, the first major event since the New Year.</p>
<p>One Goal Each, a Tie</p>
<p>The match started at 2:45 PM, with Wu Shouheng as the referee and Le Xiurong and Chen Jixiang as the linesmen. The Soviet Union kicked off, but was immediately blocked back. Soon, they came back again, and Robert Stov made a pass in the middle, and Gao Luonuo on the left wing shot hard, and the Soviet Union broke the net first, only three minutes after the start of the game. Donghua counterattacked, and three minutes later, Han Longhai received a pass from Youliang and returned a goal, tying the score.</p>
<p>Donghua Takes the Lead</p>
<p>"Nephew" Chen Mingzhe shot hard, and the ball went astray. The Soviet Union's Jielinkov sent it far, and Robert Stov headed it, but it also went out obliquely. Soon, the Soviet Union attacked Donghua's goal, but fortunately Tan Fuzhen cleared the ball. Donghua's Li Yao made a solo effort, but failed. Sun Jinshun's shot was also caught by Bo Saweiqu. Until the 26th minute, Longhai went straight in, tricked Gutov, and kicked up, shooting low into the left corner. Donghua took the lead 2-1. The first half soon ended.</p>
<p>Another Tie, Two Goals Each</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, breaking through the encirclement, the Soviet Union's military appearance was slightly adjusted, and Donghua was still the original team. The barbarian general worked together to counterattack. Within two minutes, Kapustin swept from the right side, and Bang Lun did not prevent this shot, and the ball窜窜 entered the net, resulting in a 2-2 tie. Donghua was unwilling and launched a large-scale attack. In the fifth minute, Youliang took a shot near the goal, but it was too weak and was caught by the Soviet goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Seven Wins Out of Seven</p>
<p>Before long, Longhai showed his superb skills and made a great contribution. Donghua regained the lead 3-2. In the 18th minute, Li Yao got the ball on the left corner and gently crossed it, and it broke the net, making it 4-2, securing the victory. After that, both sides had attacks and defenses, but none were successful. Until the end, Donghua defeated the Soviet Union 4-2, creating a great record of seven wins out of seven.</p>

<h3>Fragments from the Yiyuan</h3>
<p>The Siberian cold wave has frozen the people of Shanghai stiff. Yesterday, the weather was surprisingly clear, with a gentle breeze and bright sunshine, perfect weather for playing and watching soccer. Inside the Yiyuan field, crowds of men and women watched Donghua win their seventh straight game, beaming with joy.</p>
<p>Basketball teams came to Shanghai, leaving the Shanghai basketball team in a state of defeat. The Municipal Gymnasium has become deserted. The Shanghai team has been away for two or three weeks for the inter-port soccer competition. The Shanghai soccer team has been torn apart and lacks vitality. Shanghai fans are itching for soccer. No wonder they rushed to be the first yesterday, as they have been estranged from this for a long time.</p>
<p>Donghua has won seven straight games and still has one game against the Soviet Union and two games against Youyou. It seems that the Group A championship is within reach.</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, who is very popular in Hong Kong and praised by the "King of Soccer," did not have the opportunity to perform as goalkeeper yesterday, with only one good save.</p>
<p>Han Longhai scored three goals alone, stealing the spotlight. Sun Jinshun became lazy, and Jia Youliang also did not have any outstanding points.</p>
<p>The Soviet center, also the center of the Shanghai inter-port team, the little blond Robert Stov, was restrained by Donghua. Although under surveillance, he was still "good."</p>
<p>The Soviet left winger, Golonov, was well-received and received much attention. (English)</p>

<h3>The Gold Shop Industry General Assembly Passed Three Key Points for Saving the Industry; Requesting the Government to Revoke Restrictions and Allow the Sale of Gold Jewelry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai gold shop industry held an emergency general membership meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 2:00 PM yesterday. Present were Feng Guangjia, a specialist from the Bureau of Social Affairs, Yan Esheng, a secretary from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, representatives from various gold shops in the city, and representatives from gold shops in Nanjing, Wuxi, Nantong, Kunshan, Shaoxing, and other places, totaling about 400 people. Yao Lianfang of Lao Qiutianbao Gold Shop served as chairman. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing (Xin Qiutianbin), Chen Depeng (Wuhua), Zhang Jingle (Lao Baocheng), Qiu Yunliang (Lao Tianbao), Yu Yongsui (Baocheng), and Chen Ziqing (Xing Qiongqing) were elected as the seven-member presidium. Then, Feng Guangjia, a specialist from the Bureau of Social Affairs, gave a speech, stating that the purpose of the gold shop industry's general membership meeting was to discuss the business problems of the entire gold shop industry, and he hoped that the representatives could engage in research and discussion through legal procedures and steps. Then, Yan Esheng gave a speech, stating that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce expressed great sympathy for the situation of the gold shop industry and was willing to assist. According to general perception, the purchase of gold jewelry was originally a disguised form of savings. After the sale of gold jewelry was prohibited, the surplus funds of the general middle and lower classes would either be wasted or turned to the hoarding of daily necessities, which would cause price fluctuations and contradict the government's policies. At present, the government has no way to deal with those who hold gold bars and ingots, but it makes such regulations for gold shops that are engaged in legitimate business, which cannot be said to be fair. And whether changing gold jewelry to silver jewelry is feasible in the general habits of our country is also quite a problem. After Mr. Yan's speech, Yan Chunrong, chairman of the Nanjing Gold Shop Industry Association, gave a speech, meaning that the regulation on the 16th of this month prohibiting all gold transactions was tantamount to an indefinite sentence for the gold shop industry, and the regulation on the 21st that gold shops were only allowed to sell but not buy was tantamount to sentencing the gold shop industry to death. After Mr. Yan's speech, the discussion on organizing a committee to save the industry was held, and three points were passed: (1) Organize a temporary committee to save the industry. (2) Invite the committee to unite representatives from various places to carry out the work together. (3) Authorize the committee to handle the work of saving the industry under three major principles. The three principles are: (1) Request the government to revoke the regulations on time-limited registration, time-limited sales, and mandatory exchange for national currency. (2) Allow the gold shop industry to engage in the business of collecting, processing, and selling gold jewelry. (3) Request the government to allow the gold shop industry to apply to the Central Bank for allocation to meet demand. Then, the general assembly elected the members of the committee to save the industry. In addition to the seven members of the presidium as ex officio members, Ge Zhenxin (Yang Qinghe), Shen Zenglin (Fang Jiuling), Zhao Enbo (Lao Tianbin), Qiu Zhaonian (Shikang), and Wu Pengnian (Baocheng) were elected as members. The committee to save the industry was established on the same day to study ways to save the industry, and the meeting was adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Another News] Representatives of the gold shop industry in Yangtai and Zhenjiang, northern Jiangsu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. All the staff of the Ningbo industry also sent a telegram in response, and two representatives will arrive today or tomorrow. Director Deng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Specialist Tang of the Ministry of Social Affairs are in Shanghai on official business, and the joint petition delegation of labor and management representatives of the gold shop industry plans to visit the Municipal Chamber of Commerce today to submit a petition.</p>

<h3>Japanese Silk Cocoon Transport to China Shows Promise of Success</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to sources, regarding the negotiations on transporting Japanese silk cocoons to China, the Allied Headquarters' attitude towards this matter has changed recently due to the drop in silk prices in the US market, and the proposed price is also more reasonable. If negotiations continue, there is a good chance of success. According to qualified people who told reporters: The resurgence of Japan's silk industry in the future must take sweeping the Southeast Asian market as its development goal. China's silk industry must work together with the support of the government to protect the market in Southeast Asia. National silk has a unique dyeing property due to soil and water conditions, which is loved by people in Southeast Asia. We must maintain its advantages and make further improvements. If national silk can have a vast market in Southeast Asia, it does not matter even if we give up sales in other parts of the world.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Yarn and Cloth Transported to Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hanmin ship sailed from Shanghai to Guangzhou the day before yesterday. In addition to shipping more than 1,900 packages of raw peanuts, 1,300 pieces of bean cake, 800 packages of fertilizer powder, more than 450 packages of beans, and more than 3,500 pieces of general merchandise, there were also more than 1,140 pieces of cotton yarn and more than 1,040 pieces of piece goods. The yarn and cloth were all handled by merchants and were the first large shipment since the government banned the transport of yarn and cloth to Guangdong last October. It was previously reported that the ban on transporting yarn and cloth to the south would be lifted, but there has been no definite news. The Hakka community is eagerly awaiting the implementation of this measure as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Central Bank to Issue 5,000 Yuan New Banknotes Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank has recently decided to issue a new 5,000 yuan banknote starting today to meet actual needs and facilitate the settlement of large amounts of money. The new banknotes are printed by the Central Printing Factory and Daye Company. The designs and colors are excellent and are all intaglio prints. If needed, people can apply to the bank's issuing bureau for exchange.</p>
<h3>Securities News: Listing of Foreign Stocks Still Requires Some Time; No Plans to Auction Public Bonds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the government promulgated the new economic plan and banned the trading of gold and foreign currency, market idle funds have tended to concentrate in the securities market. According to a related source: This is actually the most normal outlet for idle funds. In the future, state-owned production enterprises will be returned to private operation, and it will generally be nothing more than issuing shares. It is hoped that the securities market can fully exert its functions and achieve the goal of monetizing assets and securitizing funds.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the listing of foreign stocks, the reporter specially visited a responsible person from the Municipal Securities Exchange yesterday. According to him: The foreign companies concerned have repeatedly discussed the listing of foreign stocks with the stock exchange authorities. However, recently, the foreign companies are successively handling capital increases, so they must wait until they have completed the legal registration procedures with their home governments and then be approved by our country's competent authorities before their stocks can be traded on the market. Therefore, he believes that it will still take some time. As for the auction of public bonds, the stock exchange previously received an order from the Ministry of Finance to "postpone the auction," and there has been no change in the instruction. Therefore, it is unlikely that an auction will be held in the short term.</p>
<h3>China and Japan Should Delimit Fishing Zones</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is reported that the relevant authorities have generally made a decision in principle on the future development of China's fishery. In terms of geographical structure, China's coastal areas are among the best fish-producing areas in the world, but there are not many large schools of fish. Therefore, in fact, Taiwan will be the main base for fishery and will develop towards the Southwest Pacific. However, due to environmental and equipment reasons, if Japan's fishery cannot be properly restricted, it will be difficult for China to compete with it for a while. And Japanese fishing boats may invade our territorial waters from time to time. Therefore, the relevant authorities will suggest delimiting the fishing zones of China and Japan in the Western Pacific at future international conferences.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Merchants' Association Decides to Reorganize</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] There were only several hundred import and export merchants in the city when the association was established, but it has increased to 1,400 at present. Therefore, the association has decided to reorganize to make the internal organization more complete and sound. It is reported that the association will hold a general membership meeting on April 1 to discuss the reorganization. At present, the various small committees of the association have mostly suspended their business due to the association's decision to reorganize.</p>
<h3>United States Adopts Tough Policy to Interfere with Gold and Foreign Currency Speculation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd] According to people in the gold and silver industry here: The Chinese government's recent explicit ban on the free trading of gold and US dollars may have been caused by US interference. The US government is now adopting a stronger policy against domestic and foreign actions that support funding and speculation in US dollars. People in the gold and silver industry believe that foreign governments have received private information that the US government is planning to strictly interfere with gold and US dollars. It is speculated that Mexico's cessation of gold exports was at least hinted at by Washington, and other Latin American governments have probably also received this hint.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The US Department of Commerce recently released a report stating that exports of gold bars in January totaled 2,917,000 ounces (compared to 3,302,000 ounces in December of last year and 3,000,000 ounces in January of last year). Imports of gold bars in January totaled 2,379,000 ounces (compared to 1,446,000 ounces in December of last year and none in January of last year). Exports of silver in the above three periods were 2,741,000 ounces, 6,901,000 ounces, and 28,785,000 ounces, respectively. Imports of silver were 7,451,000 ounces, 4,010,000 ounces, and 909,000 ounces, respectively. US monetary gold increased by 219,489,000 yuan in January to become 20,749,000,000 yuan. Gold reserves in the Federal Reserve Bank decreased by 3,632,000,000 yuan from 196,000,000 yuan to 3,632,000,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Request Adjustment of Rationing Prices</h3>
<p>The rationing of flour in the city is suffering because flour mills are short on raw materials. It has been agreed that the authorities will be responsible for half a month first to fill the gap. At the same time, the factories will borrow money to purchase wheat for milling and supply. The purchased wheat will start to be milled and supplied this week. Therefore, Fuxin and the other five factories will also start to take over the supply of rationing flour today. The price will remain at 30,000 yuan per bag. However, according to flour mills, the industry has submitted a request to the authorities to adjust the rationing price, because the purchase price of wheat is more than 70,000 yuan per dan, so the cost of flour is more than 50,000 yuan per bag. It is said that this matter will be decided at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Flannel Sales Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Flannel sales were quite brisk yesterday. Local customers are continuing to purchase. Medium gray colors are especially active. Incoming herringbone cloth is selling for 140,000 to 150,000 yuan per yard, and plain cloth is selling for 95,000 to 100,500 yuan. Local factory goods, such as Zhongfang, Zhanghua, and Zhenfeng brands, are mostly selling for more than 60,000 yuan and up to 80,000 yuan. Spring tweed that is slightly presentable is mostly selling for 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per yard. Summer tweed merchants are shouting high prices without any standard due to source and environmental factors.</p>
<h3>French Imports of Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>12,000 Kilograms in January</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] In January of this year, France imported a total of 28,400 kilograms of silk cocoons, valued at 13,153,000 francs, compared to 24,600 kilograms in December of last year, valued at 9,399,000 francs. All of the silk cocoons imported in January were exported from Italy, while most of the silk cocoons in December were exported from Persia. In addition, France exported 55,900 kilograms of silk in January, of which 19,200 kilograms were exported from Japan and 21,000 kilograms were exported from China.</p>
<h3>England Plans to Promote International Wool Trade</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] In order to study and exchange information and to promote closer ties in wool trade between countries around the world, the British government is initiating the establishment of an international wool research group and is inquiring with the governments invited to attend this year's international wool conference about their opinions on the establishment of the group. Our government has also received the above notice, and it is said that the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Agriculture are jointly discussing policy.</p>
<h3>Northeast National Goods Exhibition: Manufacturers Can Apply; State Banks and Bureaus Export Documentary Credit: Total Amount is 500 Million Northeast Circulation Vouchers</h3>
<p>The Northeast Economic Commission has scheduled to hold a Northeast National Goods Mobile Exhibition in April of this year and is seeking participation from national goods manufacturers within the customs. The Four Joint Offices has specially approved the method for state banks and bureaus to provide export documentary credit for national goods participating in the exhibition. It is reported that manufacturers who wish to participate in the exhibition of national goods can apply to the China, Communications, Farmers, and China Trust Banks for export documentary credit. The total amount of export documentary credit is 500 million Northeast circulation vouchers, with a limit of 20 million circulation vouchers per household. Converted to national currency, the goods will be mortgaged at 70% of the Shanghai market price for a term of 30 days. The interest rate will be negotiated and reported by the handling banks. The documentary credit procedure will be for the representative bank to issue a credit purchase certificate to the Northeast Mobile National Goods Exhibition of the Economic Commission, which will be sent to the Shanghai China National Goods Joint Operation Company for delivery to the manufacturers participating in the exhibition. The manufacturers will sign drafts within the limit per household and submit them to Shanghai for payment. The method of repayment is that after the mortgaged goods arrive in Shenyang, they will be changed to cash mortgage. During the exhibition period, the proceeds will be collected by personnel sent by the bank. Goods that have not been repaid will be purchased by the Materials Adjustment Committee.</p>

<h3>Accomplices and Masterminds of the Wanbaoshan Incident: A Porter's Rise – The Antiquarian – A Red Figure in the Northeast Sixteen Years Ago – "Second Master" Hao in Jilin Prison</h3>
<p>— Changchun, 12th (Airmail Dispatch) – Our Correspondent in Shenyang, Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>In the desolate Changchun, a stirring news event is rare. The case of Hao Yongde, the mastermind behind the Wanbaoshan Incident, being publicly tried for the first time on the 19th, not only caused a sensation in Changchun but also drew the attention of people across the nation.</p>
<p>This event, shimmering in the painful history of Sino-Japanese relations, has become a stain on the Chinese nation. It was the fuse for the anti-Chinese movement in Korea sixteen years ago, a prelude to the September 18th Incident, and a buried spark of the Second World War in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited Hao Yongde, the mastermind of the Wanbaoshan Incident, at Jilin First Prison. With the warden's permission, he was brought from his cell to the warden's office. Hao Yongde wore heavy shackles but moved without much difficulty, bowing deeply to us from afar. He is tall and sturdy, with a slightly hunched back, a long face, a broad forehead, and a three-inch-long, grizzled beard. At seventy-three years old, his eyes still gleam brightly, and his spirit is excellent. He was dressed in a blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers, without a cotton-padded waistcoat, showing no signs of being afraid of the cold. The warden invited him to sit down and introduced him to the reporter. He stood up again and bowed.</p>
<p>A Rude Awakening – A Slightly Embarrassing Situation</p>
<p>Sixteen years after the Wanbaoshan Incident, the major details had faded in his memory. After being questioned by the reporter, he seemed to have been rudely awakened, appearing somewhat embarrassed. He paused for a moment and said, "I am illiterate, a farmer. That year, regarding the land cultivation, I went back home and was allowed to cultivate the land. The then County Magistrate Ma and the police chief both approved it. So, I gathered people from the village to cultivate the land. When we got there, they wouldn't allow us to cultivate it, so we didn't. The county government sentenced me to six months in prison. We are farmers; we don't know anything. Later, they said a war had started, but there was no war, and there were no Koreans. I am illiterate and would never collude with the Japanese. Who would harm our country...?"</p>
<p>Such a sensational and bloody incident was dismissed by him as if it were nothing significant, while he pretended to be unaware of the following facts.</p>
<p>Major Bloodshed – Casually Dismissed</p>
<p>The facts are: In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Jilin Provincial Government permitted a small number of Korean immigrants to enter the country to cultivate rice. He was incited by the deceased local strongman Zhang Yantang (also known as Zhang Hongbin) and Xiao Yuchun (Xiao Zengxiu) of Wanbaoshan Village, Changchun County. He used three thousand silver dollars and two gold bracelets to bribe County Magistrate Ma Zhongyuan (still alive). At his behest, he colluded with Korean individuals such as Shen Yunze to organize the Changnong Rice Field Company, using the Mainland Business Association of the Korean Residents' Association on Qima Road, Changchun, as the company's address. He also colluded with the local district chief, Cao Yanshi, as the guarantor, leasing over five hundred qing (one qing equals ten mu) of uncultivated and cultivated land near Majiashao and Guanhua Village owned by Zhang Yantang and twelve other households to the Changnong Rice Field Company. A lease was signed on April 16th of the same year, with a term of ten years, violating the spirit of the Gando Convention between Japan and China on September 4, 1909, which "prohibited Koreans from residing and leasing land." He then subleased the aforementioned five hundred qing of uncultivated and cultivated land to Koreans for rice cultivation. However, rice cultivation required water from the Yitong River, and the distance between the land and the Yitong River was over twenty li. They entrusted Zou Chunyao and others to dredge and lease land, but they did not obtain the permission of the local landowners. With the aim of obtaining the right to draw water from the intermediate land and developing their rice fields for illegal profits, they used the county government's illegal permission and the influence of the Japanese and Koreans, considering the land between their fields and the Yitong River as the natural site for a canal. Disregarding the permission of the landowners of the intermediate land, such as Sun Yongqing, they openly gathered 188 unregistered Korean residents to live there. On May 1st of the same year, they forcibly dug the canal, leading to opposition from the landowners whose land was being dug, such as Sun Yongqing, who appealed to Chinese officials to expel them. At this time, the Japanese revealed their true colors. On June 4th of the same year, the Japanese Consulate in Taonan dispatched police, armed with guns, to protect the Korean residents. The Japanese continued to send police, and our people, unable to reason effectively, gathered on July 1st to fill in the canal. The police officers dispatched by the Japanese consulate opened fire on our people, although no one was injured. Our people had no choice but to retreat.</p>
<p>Digging Canals, Sawing Trees, Building Dams, Planting Rice</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese expanded their propaganda, leading to a major anti-Chinese incident in the border region of Korea. As a result, the Korean residents of Wanbaoshan Majiashao, under the protection of Japanese police with guns, continued to dig canals, saw trees, and build dams, preventing the landowners from resisting. They planned a canal about twenty li long, nine feet wide, and seven feet deep, using the excavated soil to occupy nine feet of the people's fields on both sides, occupying a total of over twenty-nine households, including the victim Xi Shuiqing. They took over twenty qing and one mu of fertile land and thirteen qing and seven fen of wasteland for canal construction. They also felled willows belonging to the victims, such as Sun Yongqing, covering an area of several zhang. Because of the damming of the river, over a hundred qing of fertile land and over twenty qing of planted rice fields were flooded. The issue remained unresolved until September of the same year.</p>
<p>Son Studying in Japan, Eldest Daughter Married to a Japanese</p>
<p>The reporter knew that he wouldn't reveal the truth about the events of that year if asked directly, so he shifted the topic to his family background. He said he was from Tianjin and had been in the Northeast for fifty-three years. He started as a porter and has one son and two daughters. His son studied at the "Imperial University" in Japan, and his eldest daughter is married to a Japanese. Someone told the reporter in private that he used to run a brothel. His daughters are not his biological children but two beautiful prostitutes. He first used a "beauty trap" to collude with the Japanese.</p>
<p>Antique Collection – All Confiscated</p>
<p>He rose from a porter to amass a fortune!</p>
<p>The reporter then asked about the valuable antiques confiscated by the authorities. Where did they come from? He replied that he had always liked antiques and porcelain since he was young, and he bought them over time. He also said that after Japan's surrender, the Communists arrested him twice: once in Shuangchengpu and once in Harbin, demanding money. He didn't give them a single copper plate. He said he really had no money.</p>
<p>This famous "Second Master Hao" of the puppet Manchukuo era was originally a rogue from the lower rungs of Chinese society. He lived on Qima Road in Changchun, near where the Koreans lived. He was an ardent believer in ghosts and spirits, and the Japanese also valued him. At a time when Japan was plotting to invade China, and the Koreans were taking advantage of the chaos, the Chinese were suffering. "Second Master Hao" aided the enemy, harmed his compatriots, and was considered a major culprit in attracting foreign disasters. No one would say "no."</p>
<h3>Singapore's Surging Labor Strikes: Japanese Prisoners of War Become Treasures</h3>
<p>— Singapore, 2nd (Airmail Dispatch) – Our Traveling Correspondent in Nanyang, Qiu Ai</p>
<p>Singapore, the premier naval port of the Far East and the largest port in Nanyang, now has blocked drains, stagnant water, and a stench in the air. Starting from February 1st, anyone relying on public transportation, except for private matters, will have to walk. The number of trains on the Malayan Peninsula is decreasing daily, and night trains have already been suspended. Astute readers, upon reaching this point, will undoubtedly realize that Singapore is being strangled by labor unrest and cannot even breathe.</p>
<p>Seven Departments of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Last December, five Chinese laborers from the Municipal Council submitted a petition to the chairman, requesting a response within two weeks (i.e., before January 10th). Otherwise, relevant labor unions would take appropriate action. The workers presented twenty demands, the main ones being: ordinary laborers should receive double their current salary; salaries should be paid for Sundays and holidays, and work on Sundays should be paid at double the rate; back pay should be given for the three and a half years of the occupation period; any laborer who resigns or is dismissed by the Municipal Council should be given a generous severance payment based on their length of service; suitable housing with water and electricity should be provided to laborers as soon as possible, with two single people sharing a room and each family occupying two rooms; and any laborer without housing provided should receive a monthly allowance of ten dollars.</p>
<p>On January 8th, the chairman responded to the petition, stating that the representatives were impolite. He suggested that the petitioners should register or join a formal labor union and offered to discuss the matter with any labor union representing the interests of workers in various departments that the Municipal Council members deemed satisfactory. Only after such discussions would the Municipal Council give them a detailed response.</p>
<p>On the 13th, the interim secretary of the labor unions sent a letter to the Municipal Council, stating that the labor unions were prepared to jointly discuss the workers' grievances to reach a mutual understanding and did not intend to threaten or be disrespectful. They expressed joy at the chairman's willingness to discuss their plight.</p>
<p>The next day, the chairman of the Municipal Council replied, reminding the workers that only one Chinese worker had appeared when the original petition was submitted on December 28th, and no Chinese representatives were present when he was visited on January 11th. He added that if the labor unions could guarantee that they were properly formed and their registration applications were under consideration by the Registrar of Trade Unions, he and the city councilors could give a detailed response to their twenty demands. However, the matter still required careful study, and he could not provide an immediate answer.</p>
<p>On the 19th, Nafu, in his capacity as the permanent secretary of the seven labor unions of the Municipal Council, sent a letter to the Municipal Council, accusing the council chairman of using diplomatic evasions. He stated that extending the exchange of letters would be futile, so they were compelled to send a final communication, demanding a response before 5:00 PM on January, failing which the committee would implement a strike. During the strike, which would be conducted peacefully, the authorities were prohibited from using the following methods to undermine the strike: (1) employing Japanese prisoners of war to replace workers; (2) employing workers belonging to hostile labor unions; (3) canceling the strikers' rice rations; (4) reclaiming the workers' dormitories; (5) using the police to interfere with the workers' peaceful assembly; and (6) suspending salaries during the strike.</p>
<p>The strike has been ongoing for several days, and the two sides are deadlocked. A satisfactory resolution is likely to take considerable time.</p>
<p>Tram and Coal Mine Labor Strikes Follow</p>
<p>The strike by workers from seven departments of the Municipal Council has already given the Singapore administrative authorities a headache, but just as one wave subsides, another rises. A tram workers' strike is imminent. The workers have given the management two days to fully respond, failing which they will unanimously implement a strike.</p>
<p>The tram workers' strike has a more complex background. Tram workers are divided into three categories: (1) drivers; (2) ticket sellers; (3) inspectors. It was decided that a ticket seller was cheating and was beaten by an inspector. The ticket seller was dissatisfied and contacted the drivers to jointly file a complaint with the manager. The most important condition was that the inspector should apologize to the ticket seller. The manager, due to the company's organization and position, refused this request. The ticket sellers and drivers harbored resentment, so after the recent labor negotiations broke down, they decided that the management must fully accept the workers' fifteen conditions, failing which they would implement a strike.</p>
<p>While the labor unrest in Singapore remains unresolved, a coal mine strike has erupted in Malaya. According to reliable sources in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya has only enough coal to last for ten days. Unless the Malaya Coal Company resumes production of a significant amount of coal by February 8th, various public services, such as electricity and trains, will be completely suspended.</p>
<p>The Federated Malay States Mining Association has requested that the government promptly import coal and take effective steps to restore coal production. The mining sector is deeply concerned about the government's strict restrictions on electricity use due to the coal shortage, which will affect the tin mines that have previously received government loans to facilitate their early recovery.</p>
<p>Employing Japanese Prisoners of War</p>
<p>Since the strike began, workers have been asking people everywhere to donate living expenses and demanding that the police not interfere, which has been achieved. However, the government is using a new tactic, employing Japanese prisoners of war to replace the workers. Currently, the cleaning and sanitation work in the Singapore city center is being done entirely by Japanese prisoners of war. The Japanese prisoners of war are naked from the waist up, some wearing sanitary masks over their noses. They are very cooperative in taking out the trash for people. When someone gives them a cigarette or two, they are endlessly grateful, repeatedly saying "Arigato." As for Kuala Lumpur, over two hundred Japanese prisoners of war have recently been transferred to work at the coal mines. This number will gradually increase in the coming days. The government has decided to hire foreign labor to maintain coal production.</p>
<p>A Crisis Ahead – Resolve It Early</p>
<p>In all fairness, the world has been turbulent since the end of World War II. The Far East is in chaos, and Europe is also in chaos. China is not at peace, and neither is Nanyang. Over the past seventeen months, the Singapore government has devoted its full efforts to stabilizing the financial situation, implementing rationing, and suppressing the black market, causing prices to fall daily. This effort is commendable. However, current prices in Singapore are at least two to three times higher, or even five to six times higher, than before the war. Workers' salaries have not increased proportionately. They are suffering, filled with grievances, and once stirred up, the labor unrest will be unstoppable. At the end of last year, over two hundred stores in Singapore closed—breaking a record—and business is now very slow. It will likely be difficult for the Singapore government to remain unaffected.</p>
<p>As for employing Japanese prisoners of war to replace workers, this is a temporary measure. The Singapore government should not consider this method appropriate. If the labor unrest cannot be resolved quickly, workers, driven by the need for food and clothing, may resort to desperate measures. The danger is unimaginable.</p>

<h3>Taiwan's Highways: Absorbing Mainland Tourists, Revealing Swiss Atmosphere</h3>
<p>— Taipei, 8th Dispatch via Airmail · Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun for This Newspaper</p>
<p>Every visitor from across the sea to Taiwan feels that the transportation is both convenient and comfortable. Especially the highways. Sitting in spacious seats, gazing at the island's scenery, there's none of the cramped feeling of riding a tram in Shanghai. Taiwan, after all, still maintains its tranquility and peace.</p>
<p>The Chairman and his wife visited Taiwan last year. On the high-quality road to Keelung, eight new-style public buses sped past in forty minutes. He nodded frequently, witnessing the accelerated progress of transportation after the takeover, and expressed his satisfaction.</p>
<p>Keelung-Taipei Line: A Bus Every Ten Minutes</p>
<p>Those who haven't been to Taiwan would never imagine that the island possesses such an extensive transportation network. From Keelung to Taipei, the main passenger transport relies entirely on highways. From morning till night, every ten minutes a vehicle capable of accommodating thirty-two people departs, truly a transportation artery from the port to the provincial capital. On the wide, glossy cement road, passengers are carried back and forth at a speed of seventy kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>Keelung has been designated as a transshipment port for South China. Without "water rats," shipments are fast, warehouses are plentiful, and freight is cheap. American freight will use this as a base to distribute goods to Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The importance attached to Keelung indicates the near-term prosperity of Taiwan Province. This 29.8-kilometer route will not decline; it will only flourish!</p>
<p>Mileage in Operation: Over One Thousand Kilometers</p>
<p>The reporter remembers that at the beginning of the restoration, only 249 kilometers of highways were open to traffic throughout the province, with a monthly mileage of 60,000 vehicle kilometers. Currently, the entire island's ring road, totaling over 1,000 kilometers, is open to traffic. The current mileage in operation reaches 1,115 kilometers, with an average daily mileage of 13,346.6 vehicle kilometers. This is unprecedented progress in highway transportation in this province.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, Taiwan Province can be said to have a highway density far greater than any other province in the country. Besides rural roads, the main and branch lines that have been completed total over 5,000 kilometers. Calculating over the province's 36,000 square li, there is an average of slightly less than one kilometer per seven square li. This is Taiwan's excellent transportation foundation.</p>
<p>Building from Scratch: A Model of Construction</p>
<p>The Highway Bureau, established on August 1st of last year, faced immense difficulties because of the severe shortage of vehicles at the time of the takeover, the difficulty in finding sources, and the difficulty in repairing them. As a result, it finally borrowed money from the Bank of Taiwan and ordered 300 new vehicle chassis from the United States in batches. These were gradually assembled. Now there are 112 new and old vehicles operating throughout the island.</p>
<p>Director Hua Chousong told the reporter that this province has a dense highway network and a good foundation, but the Highway Bureau almost started from scratch. The government didn't provide a single penny, so they had to borrow from the bank. Now, they are repaying the loan monthly with the daily surplus, which is the convenience of a public enterprise. It is understood that another batch of thirty-eight new vehicles capable of accommodating forty-two people will arrive in March and be put into operation. This will be good news for travelers!</p>
<p>Female Ticket Sellers: Skimming Sent to Court</p>
<p>The various stations maintaining highway transportation employ a total of 693 people, including 121 drivers, all of whom have skilled techniques. The highest salary is a base salary of 100 yuan per month, a subsidy of 2,000 yuan, and a mileage wage of 2,200 yuan. The Highway Bureau employs female ticket sellers, all local Taiwanese girls. They earn 50 yuan per month (twenty times the previous amount), plus a subsidy and a labor bonus of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Passenger transport can generate a daily income of 360,000 yuan. It is understood that the practice of skimming has also begun to spread to the island, but the Highway Bureau takes legal action against this petty theft. Several ticket sellers have already been sent to court for skimming ticket sales.</p>
<p>Island-Wide Traffic: Rich in Swiss Atmosphere</p>
<p>The Highway Bureau is now preparing to handle freight transport, mainly for short distances, to supplement the railways' shortcomings. In particular, the mainland needs 60,000 tons of coal every month, but the province's internal transportation is insufficient, only able to transport two-thirds of that amount. Currently, the province's freight transport is maintained by seven jointly operated public-private trucking companies, with 488 trucks, carrying local products such as timber, vegetables, and medicinal materials.</p>
<p>In addition to planning to achieve one million vehicle kilometers per month (30,000 vehicle kilometers per day) on the island's main line, the bureau is actively working with the railway to organize joint island-wide travel transportation. This is a measure to attract tourists by leveraging Taiwan's climate and scenery. All transportation departments are now working towards this goal.</p>
<p>Taiwan will soon exude the atmosphere of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Transportation Administration: Better Than the Japanese</p>
<p>The reporter resides in Beitou, 12.4 kilometers from the provincial capital. Morning and evening, he rides the new Ford cars, marked with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Whole Earth Red flag, costing thirteen yuan one way. In twenty minutes, they transport him from the hot spring area to the working city area. People say the cars are light, agile, and comfortable, and they can't bear to recall riding in Shanghai's transportation, packed like sardines and slow as snails. Indeed, the Highway Bureau has answered the doubts about the abilities of mainland personnel with unprecedented progress.</p>
<p>Taiwanese people laugh and say: Highway transportation is better than what the Japanese did. Passengers also maintain the Japanese practice of queuing up to buy tickets in order, and the order is maintained. This way of life, in inheriting the spirit of the Japanese, is also worthy of consideration.</p>

<h3>Huaiyin: Political Center of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Huaiyin for this Newspaper, 4th · Reporter Ling Songshou from Taixian</p>
<p>"Han Xin City," "Crotch Bridge," as the hometown of a great figure more than two thousand years ago, and also the distribution center of "Huai Salt" hundreds of miles along the coast, Huaiyin, in the reporter's imagination, is a simple and wealthy city.</p>
<p>But this fantasy was shattered by the reality before me. The current Huaiyin is no longer as simple as imagined, but a hollow, impoverished prosperity.</p>
<h3>Lonely Grand Canal</h3>
<p>On Zhongshan Road in the north of the city and Zhongzheng Road in the east, you can see many tall buildings—including banks, hotels, inns… and others. Piles of candy stalls are placed on the streets, attracting people's attention with their colorfulness. The most fashionable clothing materials are displayed in the glass cabinets of silk shops. Glass raincoats and glass leather bags can also be found in department stores.</p>
<p>But, if you venture into the inner layers of Huaiyin to take a look, you will be surprised that this important town on the riverbank has fallen into such a state.</p>
<p>Huaiyin's eight years of enemy and puppet plundering, and one year of destruction by the Communist army, have opened the most difficult page in this city's fate. Originally the only distribution center of "Huai Salt," now, because the salt transport canal is blocked, and the coastal salt-producing areas are still unstable, Huaiyin's salt supply still depends on Yangzhou and northern Anhui.</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Office: Like Giving a Blood Transfusion</h3>
<p>To cooperate with the development of the situation in northern Jiangsu, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has set up an office in Huaiyin. This is like injecting a shot of blood transfusion into Huaiyin's prosperity. To say nothing else, there are now more than five hundred party, government, military, group, and other legal entity branch organizations established in Huaiyin. The county government is already exhausted trying to cope with these organizations coming and going, some closing and others opening. Recently, a branch of the Central Bank and a branch of the High Court had a dispute over housing and asked the county government to resolve it. The county magistrate frowned and said: "One is the country's highest financial institution, and the other is a legal and political organ. May I ask, how can I say who is wrong?"</p>
<p>Huaiyin after the great calamity is already a dried-up Huaiyin. Now, let's bring out the evidence.</p>
<h3>Cattle Snatched Away: Tilling the Land with Human Labor</h3>
<p>The total area of cultivatable land in Huaiyin County is 1,074,357 mu. Due to the soil quality, the rice yield is zero. The ratio of other grain production is as follows: wheat accounts for 50%, beans account for 20%, miscellaneous grains account for 10%, and others account for 10%. And now the administrative power can control less than 60% (the area that can be controlled in the whole county accounts for 85%). Until now, Huaiyin's food supply still depends on other ports.</p>
<p>Are all these fields able to be cultivated? That is a big question. In a barber shop, I heard the barber tell me: his home is by Hongze Lake. The fields near there are threatened by floods every summer. If you're lucky, the first season of crops (planted in winter) is harvested before the water arrives. If you're unlucky, it's simply submerged, with nothing left. Even in terms of what is harvested, the yields have been greatly reduced. In the past, each mu of land could produce five or six dou, but now it only produces one or two dou. The most serious and worrying problem is that after the villages were ravaged by the Communist army, people scattered and cattle were snatched away (the Communist army lacked transportation and mostly snatched the people's cattle for use). Last year, they even tilled the land with human labor. Unexpectedly, Chinese agriculture, which has always been backward in agricultural tools, has to regress to primitive steps. As for the Grand Canal floods, after the diversion of the Huai River into the sea, people should have been able to rest assured. But unexpectedly, the Communist army breached the dikes to vent their anger when they were about to retreat, hindering the National Army's advance. That breach was 150 meters long and could flood more than 3,500 mu of fields, washing away more than 4,000 shi of grain. Combined with other losses, the estimated amount reached 101,575,000 yuan in national currency. After the recovery of Huaiyin City, repairs were immediately carried out.</p>
<h3>County Finances Extremely Tight: Communist Army Public Grain Used</h3>
<p>Under these circumstances, the difficulty of the county's finances is self-evident. Since the autonomous tax was levied on November 15th last year, it has only been able to generate more than 8 million yuan in revenue each month—not including house taxes. House taxes started to be levied this year, and it is expected that 20 million yuan can be collected this quarter, but problems arose not long after it started. The amount of house tax collected is based on the value of the property, so cunning people inevitably take advantage of the opportunity to use tricks, causing the common people to complain endlessly. I personally saw a Baochang bargaining with another person in a bathroom. I asked County Magistrate Huang about the house tax issue, and County Magistrate Huang said to me: "I don't know very clearly either, probably it's always done according to the regulations from above." In order not to disappoint the people in the recovered areas' expectations of the government, and in order not to disappoint the government's virtue towards the people in the recovered areas, I would like to bring this up in the hope that the relevant parties can pay attention to these not-so-small incidents.</p>
<p>The county government is poor, so poor that even the public grain left behind by the Communist army has been used. 90,124 jin of wheat and 20,700 jin of corn left behind by the Communist army were used to provide meals for the county's 126 policemen.</p>
<p>Local Newspaper Pending: Educational Circles Pitiful</p>
<p>It's really unbelievable that a military and political stronghold still doesn't have a local newspaper to this day. To hear the news, apart from hearsay, people can only wait for newspapers from Shanghai that arrived five or six days ago. The reason why the newspaper cannot be published is that, in addition to economic difficulties, it is said that there are various other difficulties. Until I left Huaiyin, according to relevant parties, all the problems have been resolved, and the machine parts and lead type have been transported in, and it will be published soon.</p>
<p>As for education, it is even more pitiful. There are 134 elementary school classes, 100 teachers, and 4,400 students in the county. There is not a single middle school. The Su Ning branch office allocated 6,000 bags of flour to the county government, with 3,000 bags to run a county-run middle school and 3,000 bags to run a county-run hospital. I saw the snow-white flour bags neatly stacked in the county government's auditorium. It is said that the county-run middle school may open next semester, and the county-run hospital may also be established in the short term.</p>
<h3>Administrative Problems in Recovered Areas: People and Wealth Most Difficult</h3>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned the Zhen Baochang and the house tax issue. I talked to Ji Zhuanyuan Yuzhi of the seventh district about this. Ji Zhuanyuan said: "The most difficult thing administratively in the recovered areas, apart from money, is the problem of people. And these two factors are mutually reinforcing. Those who can do things locally, after the war, those who died, those who fell into the water, and those who were forcibly taken away by the Communist army, those who are living in other ports, as long as they can live, who wants to rush back to suffer? As a result, those who are doing things locally today are just a group of eliminated people (of course, there are good people and bad people among them). But, under today's situation, you know that he is not strict in his behavior or his efficiency is too poor, and if you want to find another group of people to replace him, it is simply impossible. Because the matter of people always cannot be fulfilled for public benefit, you do not have compensation to give him to stabilize his life. Under these circumstances, it is not easy to gather talents, let alone without people?" Ji Zhuanyuan is a graduate of the third class of Whampoa Military Academy. He has spent half his life in the military, and is quite forthright. This passage indeed reveals the most serious problems in the current administration of the recovered areas.</p>
<p>Director Wang Gongyu of the Department is a native of Guanyun County in northern Jiangsu. He listed six key points for promoting administrative work in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu to the reporter, namely: (1) solving the economic and talent difficulties, (2) emphasizing both rule by man and rule by law, (3) recognizing difficulties and overcoming difficulties, (4) ensuring public security, (5) accepting conscience, (6) recognizing reality and seizing opportunities. In addition, Director Wang also talked to the reporter about the land problem in northern Jiangsu. His opinion is: "Northern Jiangsu is densely populated and land is scarce. On average, each farmer can only have four mu of land. How can we smoothly promote land reform without hindering the farmers' living conditions? This is a matter worthy of attention. In short, the only key point is to be able to adapt to local conditions and seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."</p>
<p>General Li Jifu, Deputy Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, is a famous general who has fought in a hundred battles. This time, in order to command from nearby, General Li specially stationed in Huaiyin. He took the time out of his busy schedule to have a few minutes of conversation with the reporter, and said to the reporter: "The work of suppressing the remaining bandits in northern Jiangsu depends on the early completion of the people's self-defense force. When the people's self-defense force is completed, the bandits will inevitably be suppressed, and local order will be stabilized accordingly." General Li finally said, "In any case, the government must ensure that the people in the recovered areas have food to eat." At this time of biting north wind and freezing frost and snow, General Li's two sentences will bring infinite warmth to the people in the recovered areas!</p>

<h3>Appeal from Lost Students in Changde, Hunan</h3>
<p>I am an eighteen-year-old student who has lost his education in Changde City, Xiangxi. Since the Japanese invaded our country, the youth in the areas invaded have suffered the misfortune of losing their education. In the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), Changde City suffered the same ravages. I, who was only receiving middle school education, was also drawn into the whirlpool of losing my education. Our country fought for eight years, and the whole people relied on the leadership of Chairman Chiang to finally achieve victory. Although the world war has been resolved, after the great trauma and deep pain of our country, the heavy burden of reconstruction and construction is pressing on the shoulders of our youth. However, the Communist Party refuses to lay down its butcher knife, and reconstruction and construction are being hindered everywhere. Although we hold a very strong will to shoulder the mission of creating a new China, we cannot obtain any way out. Therefore, we make an appeal, asking the Communist Party not to use force to seize power again, but to return the army to the country, so that the National Government can actively engage in reconstruction and construction, so that a large group of students who have lost their education and unemployment can obtain a way out. Otherwise, the Communist Party is an act of treason and a public enemy of the people! (Youth Yang Sanlin from Changde)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Remembering Pingling on the Cold Day of Tung Flowers</h3>
<p>— Lumaang</p>
<p>These days are exactly the season of "Cold Tung Flowers" in Jiangnan, even colder than the end of winter. We can't make a fire in the house, we don't have leather clothes when we go out, and from time to time we are hit by news that makes us "feel cold". It is not only bleak, but trembling!</p>
<p>Reading "Spring and Autumn," I suddenly saw Mr. Wang Pingling's masterpiece, and I couldn't help but feel emotional and yearning. Human feelings often flow towards warmth, and so do literati. In the various banners on our side, the three words "Wang Pingling" are no longer mentioned. This man has thirty years of literary history and has struggled all his life. But that's okay, Mr. Pingling is living in seclusion in a mountain city, seeking his own happiness, and does not want to engage in bare-knuckle fights with heroes with bronze muscles and iron bones, but lives a life without worries, without strife, and without demands.</p>
<p>Chongqing, this distant mountain city, is noisy and ugly in my writing. Friends from Jiangnan who have read "Eight Years in Chongqing" probably won't have any good feelings, but after reading Mr. Pingling's "Beautiful Mountain City," even I feel yearning. This is due to social changes. Just like a village girl, dressed in plain clothes, has her original style, but once she changes her clothes, she is often vulgar and unbearable. When Chongqing was the wartime capital, all kinds of people competed to enter, and the loyal and treacherous were juxtaposed. The small mountain city was crowded and unbearable, and naturally there were many people and things that people couldn't stand. After the return to peace, it must naturally return to its original position. However, we here are crowded with people, rubbing shoulders, because it also belongs to the city being competed for, the dynasty being competed for, and it is even more noisy and ugly, and our heads are dizzy. Mr. Pingling evokes beautiful memories in his thoughts of his hometown, and therefore mentions "good days in spring and autumn, apricot flowers blooming, green willows and birds singing; West Lake painting boats, Xuanwu green lotuses, Louxia red leaves, Deng Wei wax plums," and envies the happiness of those who return home. I am one of the first people to return home, not only suffering from being squeezed in the crowd of people competing for fame and fortune, but also for a year and a half, I have never appreciated the beautiful scenery of Qixia red leaves, Deng Wei wax plums, Xuanwu green lotuses, and even the six bridges and three temples. Why? Since "Victory," not only has there been no peaceful scene, but wars have been frequent and people have been living in poverty, so there is no leisurely mood to enjoy the mountains and rivers, and no money to do so. Although Jiangnan is good, how is it different from outside the Great Wall? Although returning home is early, it is even more meaningless. Therefore, I deeply feel that since there is today, why did we have it in the first place. I already felt the feeling of "Why did we have it in the first place" in last year's "Spring and Autumn", but now I sigh even more and feel even deeper. Dissatisfied with the status quo, I recall more. Everything before the war now seems to be lovely and precious everywhere. Even everything in Chongqing during the war is more satisfactory than now. It is not as bad as it is now, no wonder I, who did not think Chongqing was lovely, now have the same feelings as Pingling and admire Chongqing very much. Mr. Pingling has already said the scenery in the suburbs of Chongqing, so I won't repeat it, but when I think of the Nanshan where Pingling lives, I can't help but mention it again:</p>
<p>On the banks of the Yangtze River, or at a high point in the city, we always see a row of mountains in the south, with undulating peaks and lush greenery. The tall trees around Lao Jun Cave, as well as the temples and pagodas, are all attractive. I lived under the Futu Pavilion for a full four years, working hard and living a simple life. When I felt mentally tired, I would stop on the dam and watch the long Yangtze River flowing slowly. My line of sight crossed the Yangtze River, and then I stared at Nanshan in the distance: when the weather was clear, the Futu temples could be counted one by one, in the fog, the layers of peaks were faintly visible; on moonlit nights, I knew there was a fairyland in front in the hazy sky, and I thought of my good friend of twenty years even more. He lives in "Lizhuang" in the "mid-mountain", with three thatched cottages, bright windows and clean tables, looking north at the capital, not moved by fame and fortune, always guarding his position in cloth clothes. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, he often went to the city to participate in gatherings of the cultural world, but later these gatherings rarely saw his trace. He only reads books and writes essays in the mid-mountain. Indeed, Wang Pingling is a literati without any ambition or attempt, without any dispute, and without offending anyone. Some people think that Wang Pingling is useless and lacks the spirit of struggle, which is completely a colored view. Wang Pingling has the spirit of a traditional Chinese literati, why imitate Dong Shi and fight at every turn? Geng Pingling doesn't want to use literature and art as a stepping stone to enter officialdom, unlike some people who try to obtain the title of social worthy. It is undeniable that Wang Pingling did contribute to politics in those years, but at that time it was just a good intention, without any attempt. He has contributed his efforts and that's it. People didn't thank him, and he didn't mind. Now that he is in his fifties, due to physical and mental strength, and having seen through the world, he no longer has the good intention of serving politics. Many people are still urging him to come down the mountain, but he will not come down the mountain again. He said: "This year's New Year, I am very grateful to my friends in Jiangnan for sending letters from thousands of miles away, asking about the date of return. That piece of earnest kindness can tease my thoughts, but looking east, I don't know what era it is in the world, or I will stay in the high mountain city and watch the changing world." Pingling, beyond things, keeps himself clean and loves himself, and will end his life in the mountain city, unless his friends don't believe what I say.</p>
<p>On the cold day of tung flowers, I miss my old friend bitterly, and I write this casual and humble letter to make Mr. Jinshan smile.</p>
<h3>Love is Life</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, an emperor conducted an educational experiment. He wanted to see what words a child would say if he was not taught – was it an ancient language, Latin, Greek, or his own dialect.</p>
<p>So he adopted some newborn orphans and told the nannies to take good care of them, but with one order: they were not allowed to speak or express any emotion to the babies. As a result, these babies died early. It is said that it was because "they could not live without the warmth and affection of their caregivers."</p>
<h3>White Elephant</h3>
<p>— Sudan</p>
<p>Six years ago, I once gave a small white elephant to a friend. At that time, I was just a boy who did not understand romance. Although the feelings were pure, I did not understand that precious emotion. As the years went by, I now find those youthful dreams lovely and cherish them. Recently, I often miss that small white elephant, like longing for a distant lover.</p>
<p>Whenever the evening sunset sways in front of the window, whenever I greedily enjoy the rouge red of the setting sun, memories always entice me to step into the old courtyard, allowing me to caress the golden warmth...</p>
<p>It was early summer, and the early summer sunlight was gently shining on the green leaves outside the window, creating a serene atmosphere indoors. One quiet afternoon, I paid a farewell visit. - This meeting became a crystal pearl in my memory, bright and clear. It is a dream trace on the pages of my life, which will remain until the end of my life.</p>
<p>That unforgettable afternoon, lightly, with the melancholy of a young man, I walked into the lush green courtyard, climbed the white stone steps, and saw a charming smile through the green gauze window. The leisurely atmosphere made me forget my worries, forget the slight melancholy of farewell. The two young children were like a pair of small yellow sparrows in a green silk cage hanging in front of the window, murmuring, murmuring, talking, laughing, talking so much, so far, forgetting that one would fly away tomorrow. Perhaps it was precisely because it was a time when youth did not know the taste of sorrow, not remembering that tomorrow would be a day of parting, nor thinking that mountains and rivers would separate us, let alone understanding that parting would paint a desolate, irreplaceable, eternal emptiness in life...</p>
<p>Quietly, time slipped away from our rambling words, and I was still indifferent. When the sunset fell on the window, although there was endless reluctance, who could keep whom? There was only a gentle farewell! My friend gave me a copy of "A Nest of Gentlefolk" as a memory box - that green book deeply concealed too much lingering thought, which I did not realize at the time. - Walking out of the small garden's heavy doors, I walked back, and I let a small white elephant - a delicate ornament - be my friend's attendant.</p>
<p>Later, when someone asked me about the symbolism of the white elephant, my purity made me feel a slight sense of shame. My heart raced, and I concealed my feelings of love. I pretended that I didn't understand. Since then, the white elephant has become my confusing secret. Why didn't I capture the fleeting youth and hidden emotions at that time? Six years have passed, many storms and clear skies, many smiles and tears. I have endured too much worldly dust. Life has taught me to hide and disguise, and it has also taught me to cherish the youthful infatuation!</p>
<p>Parting has made our distance far, and years have made the distance between our hearts even farther. I have no magic wand to summon back the delicate youth, nor can I recall the lost dreams. Was it wisdom that made me suppress my emotions? Or was it foolishness? Now I think of that little white elephant, it is when I fly back to that lush green courtyard on the wings of memory. Now I have a faint melancholy, I have a faint worry, will I cry because of the withering of longing?...</p>
<p>Now, I often think of that small white elephant. I think of the feelings I gave it. For six years, has my small white elephant been my faithful messenger? Is it still safely hidden in that delicate little closet?</p>

<h3>To Mr. Zheng Wuchang on His Birthday</h3>
<p>— Shi Liang</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Wuchang celebrated his 54th birthday, and his students in Shanghai held a get-together celebration at the Ningbo Road Qianzhuang Club. I was also fortunate to be among them. During the banquet, classmate Wang Ruonan showed me a poem he had written for the birthday celebration. After reading it, not wanting to be left behind, I quickly composed two poems, expressing my respect. I do not care about the quality of my work.</p>
<p>The Southern Star shines, the Big Dipper hangs high,</p>
<p>From ancient times, great virtue enjoys a long life.</p>
<p>Painting and calligraphy make a name for the world,</p>
<p>A model teacher in the literary world of a generation.</p>
<p>Four seats of orchids are connected like jade shoots,</p>
<p>Peach and plum blossoms fill the walls, intoxicated at the jade banquet,</p>
<p>Let us jointly wish for boundless longevity,</p>
<p>The poem borrows the first chapter of the Book of Odes.</p>
<p>The Huangpu River encircles, the moon hangs bright,</p>
<p>The Eastern Sea's auspicious spirit records extended years.</p>
<p>Sesame fields and Shang Mountains add benevolence and longevity,</p>
<p>Clear moon and gentle breeze compare to ancient sages.</p>
<p>Gladly, the Cheng Gate allows one to stand in the snow,</p>
<p>It is right to celebrate the opening of the Sea House banquet,</p>
<p>Next year, when we meet again to offer birthday wishes,</p>
<p>I will wildly capture three hundred poems.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 182</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>But was Konoe willing to listen to Tsurumi's words just like that? This move was also within our expectations. Therefore, Tsurumi also had to send a secret telegram to Elder Aoki, asking him to pay attention to this future tragedy in North China. And asking him to quickly save this great calamity, to leave some reputation for the Japanese soldiers. These two secret telegrams were all handled by "012" stationed in Tokyo.</p>
<p>At the same time, we anticipated that Konoe's instructions might not come so quickly, so in addition to Tsurumi's own falsely transmitted "imperial edict", we also asked "012" to send another "imperial edict" directly to Matsui, which had to arrive around nine o'clock, as proof of Tsurumi's private telegram. In this way, Matsui could not help but believe it, and even more could not help but carry out the order.</p>
<p>Originally, the organization of the Japanese military was extremely strict, and the ingenuity of the General Staff Headquarters was especially tight. How could Tsurumi, such a small figure, be allowed to act so arbitrarily; to send telegrams as he pleased, and to forge orders as he pleased?</p>
<p>We don't need to worry too much about this point. Nor can we underestimate Tsurumi's small secret organization. Although Tsurumi's organization is small, it holds the throat of Japanese intelligence work in reporting secret information. Although it cannot grasp all the reports, it can always grasp a certain percentage. Moreover, the plan we designed was based on Konoe's hypocritical mentality. Before and after the event, it would be difficult to detect even the slightest trace. Even if he himself received some influence, because the content of this instruction was very much in line with his intentions, he might not want to investigate; he would even think that it "agreed with my heart".</p>
<p>Moreover, we have the potential of Elder Aoki buried. Sooner or later, Konoe will have to issue the order to "attack the heart is the best strategy"; the only difference is in the "time" point. According to our ideal, the difference in this time will be no more than seventy or eighty hours at most. This small matter of a few hours difference is extremely easy to make up for in the hands of "012". Since Japan launched the war of aggression against the mainland, twenty-four hours a day, clear telegrams and secret codes have never stopped for a second. Who has so much free time to check such a small difference?</p>
<p>Tsurumi went out alone, on the one hand, to inquire about the enemy's situation, and on the other hand, to respond to Matsui's request to find Wu Dingyuan. By the way, he also had to investigate how many so-called "unstable elements" they had detained; what kind of people were detained; the location of the detention, and the strength of the guards, also had to be investigated clearly in order to carry out a surprise attack.</p>
<p>The above steps must be completed before ten o'clock. The second step, the main point of the plan - the surprise attack - is expected to start around ten thirty and be completed around twelve o'clock. The first goal of the surprise attack is to liberate both the overt and covert detained "unstable elements", and the second is to demonstrate. But it does not advocate excessive bloodshed, so as not to stimulate the enemy's bestiality and destroy the hard-prepared "falsely transmitted imperial edict".</p>
<p>The method of attack and retreat is entirely in accordance with Yaoqun's revised proposal: 1. The original command team, because it must reduce the enemy's concentrated attack target, has been changed into a sporadic guidance station, one person per station, set up at the necessary intersections to and from, using various disguises as concealment, such as night market vendors, rickshaw pullers, beggars, patrolmen, etc.; pointing out the way forward when advancing, and pointing out the way back when retreating.</p>
<p>2. The action team does not use large troops, but changes to sniper units, three people per unit, using a triangular scouting post to advance or retreat; the number of units is determined according to the report obtained by Tsurumi's reconnaissance.</p>
<p>3. The original ten or more teams of the escort team, the car-mounted machine gun team, are deployed on the periphery of the action center to protect the attack and safe retreat of the action team. Yaoqun believes that this target is too obvious. Although it has the demonstration effect of strong advance and strong retreat, it is too stimulating, which may cause a large-scale search by the enemy; it is not difficult for our team and cars to escape, but once a large-scale search by the enemy, the whole city will still be turned upside down.</p>
<p>Yaoqun's proposal is to use the "inverted thorn" small group method, with two people as a group. If the action team is pursued, the inverted thorn small group will snipe behind the enemy, as a "reliable" cover. The area where this small group is ambushed must be a dark and lively street intersection, separated to the left and right to prevent being surrounded. The retreat can still use cars, but they are scattered in all directions. Of course, there are guiding sentry posts along the way to guide the advance and retreat.</p>
<p>Other various attack arrangements, such as sentries, slogans, symbols, positions, responses, cover, sudden changes, effect reconnaissance, etc., still follow Mr. Jian's plan.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Novels</h3>
<p>— Zhenzhi</p>
<p>The prohibition of novels in the Qing Dynasty, from 1652 to 1868, a period of more than 210 years, occurred a total of ten times. These ten times are: (1) Shunzhi 9th year (1652); (2) Kangxi 48th year (1709); (3) Kangxi 53rd year (1714); (4) Qianlong 1st year (1736); (5) Jiaqing 7th year (1802); (6) Jiaqing 15th year (1810); (7) Jiaqing 18th year (1813) - the above are all found in Yu Zhengxie's "Gui Yi Manuscript" Volume 9; the one in Kangxi 53rd year is also found in Liu Tingji's "Zaiyuan Miscellaneous Notes" Volume 2 - (8) Daoguang 14th year (1834), see Deng Zhicheng's "Gudong Suoji" Volume 3; (9) Daoguang 24th year (1844), see the Daoguang edition of "Quan Hui Yinshu Zhengxinlu"; (10) Tongzhi 7th year (1868), see the Tongzhi "Jiangsu Shengli". The first eight of these ten prohibitions were based on the Qing court's edicts, and the latter two were presided over by local authorities. The one in Daoguang 24th year was a petition from Zhang Jian and other gentry in Zhejiang, accompanied by a list of 120 books. The one in Tongzhi 7th year was initiated by Jiangsu Governor Ding Richang. The list of books was in two batches, and a total of 154 novels were banned. It was based on the list of books from Daoguang, with another 34 added (also attached was a list of 110 books of obscene lyrics and singing).</p>
<p>However, the prohibition of novels did not begin in the Qing Dynasty. It had already been done once in the middle of the Ming Dynasty. "Rizhilu Zhiyu" Volume 12, "Prohibition of Novels" quoted a "Shilu" saying:</p>
<p>"In the second month of the seventh year of Zhengtong, the Guozijian Jijiu Li Shinian said: Recently, there have been vulgar scholars who falsely claim strange events and embellish them with unfounded words, such as "Jian Deng Xin Hua" and the like. Not only do frivolous people in the market compete to recite and study them, but even classic scholars mostly abandon their studies and memorize them day and night for discussion. If they are not strictly prohibited, I fear that heretical and heterodox doctrines will become increasingly prevalent, confusing people's minds. I beg the Ministry of Rites to issue documents to all internal and external yamen and to the Tiel school, the Qian shi Yushi, and the Ancha si officers, who will patrol the places. Whenever they encounter such books, they should order them to be burned. Those who print and sell them or secretly study them will be punished according to the law. So that people will know the right way and not be confused by heresies."</p>
<p>According to the seventh year of Zhengtong Renxu, it is 1442 in the Western calendar. About 210 years earlier than the ninth year of Shunzhi. The quoted "Shilu" seems to be the "Zhengtong Shilu". I do not have the "Da Ming Shilu" at hand, so I cannot check this original text.</p>
<p>The only novel known to have been banned this time is "Jian Deng Xin Hua". In the early and middle Ming Dynasty, popular novels were not yet very developed, and they only became increasingly prosperous after the Jiajing period. The ones that circulated in the early and middle periods were mostly of the legendary literary type. This type of novel inherited the aftermath of Tang Dynasty legends, and was recently influenced by Yuan and Song Dynasty Meidong's "Rouhong Ji", and the trend became increasingly rampant. By the time Qu You's "Jian Deng Lu", "Jian Deng Xin Hua", and Li Zhen's "Jian Deng Yu Hua" were published, they intensified their efforts, and imitators followed one after another, such as Zhao Bi's "Xiaoxie Ji", Zhou Li's "Bingzhu Qingtan", Qiu Jun's "Zhongqing Feiji", Lu Meihu's "Huaichun Yaji", etc., which ran alongside popular novels in the Jiajing and Wanli periods. The "Jian Deng Xin Hua" banned in the Zhengtong period was a representative of this type of "talented and romantic novel".</p>
<p>The prohibition of novels in the Ming and Qing Dynasties is roughly as described above. But were there any prohibitions in the Yuan Dynasty? According to "Yuan Shi" Volume 105 "Xingfa Zhi" Fifty-third, Xingfa (4) Prohibitions says:</p>
<p>"All common people's children, not engaging in business, often sing lyrics and stories in cities and towns, teach miscellaneous plays, and gather crowds for licentious entertainment, all of which are prohibited and punished."</p>
<p>This prohibits the singing of lyrics and stories, not the banning of novel books. The two are completely different. As far as is known now, there is not enough literature to show that there was also a prohibition of novels in the Yuan Dynasty.</p>

<h3>The Philosophy of Borrowing Money</h3>
<p>— Qilou Zhuren</p>
<p>A university professor talked about the way of life for poor people. He said that the first thing is to be diligent in getting haircuts, and the second is to try to avoid borrowing money. I have not fully followed the former, but I have indeed been very "diligent" in the latter.</p>
<p>Naturally, I sometimes borrow money from the few people who will not distance "me" and despise "me" because of borrowing money. Sometimes I have borrowed money from friends just to make my hand more comfortable. These friends understand me, and their friendship is not built on the word "money". Borrowing money is really seen as something that should be in their friendship, so sometimes I ask them to borrow, and sometimes they borrow from me, and they will definitely pay back when they borrow.</p>
<p>As for some other people, they seem to expect me to negotiate with them as soon as they see me, and draw a clear line with me economically everywhere. They are always afraid of me seeing more than two banknotes, and for people who do so, I will never ask them for any financial friendship, as my teacher said, because what they see of me is just the word "poor", not the word "urgent". Even if I have a great need, in their eyes it is just a poor look. They are saviors in times of urgency, not saviors of poverty.</p>
<p>When I was hiding in the countryside, I was once in a difficult situation. At that time, there were many rich households hiding in the countryside with me. In the chaotic situation, robberies occurred day and night. Although I was poor, I had the identity of a city dweller, so there was always the possibility of being coveted. One day, in front of several local hooligans, I had to use a little trick, saying that I was having a hard time and was going to borrow money from someone. This someone had power and money, and no one would dare to touch him.</p>
<p>A few days later, I happened to stroll over to his place to see a friend. As soon as he saw me, his face changed. I immediately knew what he was thinking and felt that I had to explain it to him. I told him that I had resolutely said the word borrow money (his face looked even worse at this time), but I was just using Chen Ping's clever trick to repel thieves. As soon as these words were spoken, his face really seemed like a clear sky after rain, and he immediately piled on a heartfelt smile. This was a cheerful look that I had never seen on his face before.</p>
<p>The teacher's philosophy of not borrowing money from people is the best example of this. You see how happy it can make people not to borrow money!</p>
<h3>A Small Tour of Dinghu Lake, Lake City God Mountain</h3>
<p>— Meishan</p>
<p>I have been in Hangzhou for nearly a year, and I have long known about the liveliness of Chenghuang Mountain [Wu Mountain], but I have never been able to visit it. Recently, prices have soared, and my mood has become even more apprehensive. My job is also in a state of semi-suspension. I always feel a stuffy feeling in my chest, so in the afternoon, I took a heavy heart and walked alone to Chenghuang Mountain.</p>
<p>Going in from Qinghefang Dajing Alley is the entrance to the mountain. Stepping on the layers of brick-paved mountain paths, I walked to the Chenghuang, Taisui, and Lao Dongyue temples. Smoke filled the air, and incense swirled around, making those towering and evil images with black heads and brains even more terrifying. In front of the Chenghuang Temple is a large square, from which you can overlook the entire city. The scaled buildings face a lake, and the entire paradise scene is clearly visible.</p>
<p>Further on are the Three Martyrs Shrine and the July 7th Memorial Altar. Inside the altar stands a stone tablet with the three characters "Fire Ox Tribulation". It is said that it is to commemorate the invading enemies. "Fire Ox" represents the year "Ding Chou", but placing it next to the Three Martyrs Shrine, which resisted Hong Yang, always feels a bit inappropriate.</p>
<p>The only feature on the mountain, besides the dilapidated temples and the flourishing smoke, is the large number of fortune-tellers and astrologers. Hangzhou is known as the "Buddhist Kingdom" and "Paradise", and these may be the living gods in "Paradise".</p>
<p>In this day and age, people really only "ask the heavens" and "believe in ghosts and gods". They probably seized on this point, desperately flaunting their mystery and talking about philosophy, aiming at your lucky psychology of "getting promoted and making a fortune", and talking highly about their set of wife, wealth, son, and officialdom. I looked carefully at each place. Although most of the customers were middle-aged and older businessmen, needless to say, they were asking about "wealth" during the New Year, but there were also those who wore fur coats and looked like noble ladies, and young people in neat Western suits and military uniforms, full of energy, listening to them judging their bones and touching their hands to judge their lifelong honor and suffering.</p>
<p>I brought a heavy heart, but I returned with the same confusion. "Paradise" cannot be separated from the mortal world, and of course, I only saw this group of fortune-tellers asking about wealth and seeking beauty.</p>
<h3>Notes and Students - Teaching</h3>
<p>— Nianzi</p>
<p>Because I had something to do, I took the No. 2 tram from Xujiahui. Two people who looked like businessmen came up at Luban Road. They chatted from the weather to the problem of education in China, and from the problem of education in China, they narrowed down to the Chinese professors. As a student, I immediately concentrated and listened attentively.</p>
<p>One, wearing a Russian hat, said: "Ah, brother! Don't think professors are hard to be, but in fact, if you break it down, they are really worthless - simply a gramophone. This year, they hold a copy of notes and copy them on the blackboard without changing a word. Next year, they will copy the same way, and the year after, of course, they will do the same without exception... After a few years, people have already invented a new theory, and that great professor is still instilling the same old tune into the students. The students are even too lazy to go to class, and they only know how to borrow the notes from the previous class to cram. Originally, it was a subject with research potential, but now it has become a dead thing like the 'Three Character Classic' in a private school. I heard that a university opened a course called 'Modern Physics', which, as the name suggests, must contain the most advanced theories of modern times. After a few classes, a nosy student, after investigating in all directions, found that the notes copied down were really the things that the professor had collected during his student days. If you want to mark the year, it is already an antique with twenty-seven years of history. I can assert that in another twenty-seven years, as long as this professor does not retire and return to his hometown, his only magic weapon will definitely be this set of notes that has not changed a word, which is really wronging the word 'modern'..."</p>
<p>Another one with deep nearsightedness, said with a smile: "Haha! They have great principles, for example, if someone asks the professor you just mentioned, why can't some 'modern' traces be found in modern physics? Then he will definitely say with a mocking tone: The so-called modern physics is just a new theory derived from the original old ones. The principle is the same, you are only qualified to lay the foundation..."</p>
<p>The one wearing the Russian hat suddenly became impatient and said loudly: "Forget it! It's okay for students to recite books by rote, it's okay to put on airs, anyway, it's the students who are unlucky. To be honest: being able to teach an old set of notes that is twenty-seven years old is already considered so-so, the question is whether his set of notes is already a family heirloom of decades."</p>

<h3>The Whispering of Swallows and the Singing of Orioles Dissipate One's Sorrows — Two of a Series on Declining and Decadent Bird Markets</h3>
<p>— Zhu Guang</p>
<p>Before the war in Shanghai, even before the Pacific War on December 8th, the number of exotic and rare birds and beasts imported from overseas was quite substantial. The more prized birds generally came from Vietnam, Annam, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Southeast Asia, and North and South America, with Hong Kong as their main hub. There were also quite a few from Japan. According to the old-timer in the bird trade, "birds from areas around Annam and Siam, such as the Shrike, are naturally clever and can learn various dialects in a short period. Their 'genius' in language is actually far superior to that of humans, who are less eloquent." Domestic Mynas, if naturally intelligent, can also learn simple language, but these so-called "pedigree breeds" have not only ceased to be imported recently, but even domestic ones (from producing areas such as Shandong and Hebei) are rarely transported. No wonder the boss said with emotion: "The number of goods arriving now is simply less than one percent of what it was before the war."</p>
<p>Setting Up Nets and Traps: The methods of catching birds are quite interesting. Apart from naturally docile birds such as canaries and white-eyes, which are mostly raised from collected eggs, there are so-called "sky nets and earth nets" (using huge, movable nets). There are also so-called "high sticky poles," used to catch sparrows and the like, mostly with bamboo poles two or three stories high, topped with sticky glue, and the pole extended to scoop and stick. There are so-called "trap cages," which are very cleverly structured movable cages, with a "decoy bird" in the middle to attract others of its kind, and four movable windows on the lower level, specifically for catching small birds. The lower end is fitted with two large movable treadles, which are traps specifically designed for larger birds such as Mynas and Hwamei. In the Hangzhou and Shaoxing areas of Zhejiang, there are also so-called "interlocking cages," named because the movable treadles can create an automatic, continuous trapping effect. The above are mostly handicraft-style bird-catching methods frequently used by bird hunters in China. As for Southeast Asia and foreign countries, that is unknown.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a method of using anesthesia, soaking rice in strong liquor and placing it in open areas as bait. Once the birds swallow it, they become drunk and unconscious, at one's disposal, but this can only be said to be a primitive, local method.</p>
<p>The interests of bird enthusiasts, apart from their love for their appearance, such as the color of their feathers, their "figure," and their bodies, are mainly to appreciate the small movements of these small animals flapping their wings and their clear, melodious chirping. Those obsessed with birds invariably take the occasional "loud call" as a joy. As the saying goes, the whispering of swallows and the singing of orioles dissipate one's sorrows, which probably refers to this state. The so-called "loud call" is said to be the loud laughter of birds when they are elated and beside themselves with joy, while the murmuring and twittering sounds are merely human whispers, and are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Detailed Consideration: In order to elicit these "charming" actions and "pleasant" "loud calls," bird enthusiasts treat their birds with detailed consideration and utmost care. Their cautious and conscientious attitude is really far above serving their own parents, and at the very least should not be below taking care of their most favored concubines. They meticulously arrange food, drink, warmth, grooming, and bathing for these small animals, and even spare no effort to rush from all corners to the racecourse and the buildings, attending bird gatherings and tea parties to find partners for their beloved feathered friends, to relieve their loneliness and unhappiness in the cage. At the racecourse, many friends carrying birdcages come from Caojiadu, Xujiahui, and Yangshupu, and even further from Pudong and Caohejing and other suburban areas of Shanghai!</p>
<p>According to informal statistics, northerners generally like to play with "martial birds," while southerners like to raise "literary birds," which is probably due to the different temperaments of the people in the two regions. As for rare and precious birds such as the red-billed green-bodied parrots and other rare birds from Europe, America, and Southeast Asia, they are usually used by wealthy officials and wealthy families as decorations or ornaments for their magnificent furnishings. In terms of the degree of affection, they are certainly not comparable to those bird-obsessed friends mentioned above.</p>
<h3>"Sichuan Landscape Painting": Sichuan Daughter Wearing a Large Straw Hat.</h3>
<h3>Closing Empty Couplets</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>The other day I saw in the newspaper a couplet by Jin Xihou mourning the young actress Li Shifang, "Calamity from heaven," "Eternal fame," which was perfectly charming. I couldn't help but think of when the poet Xu Zhimo died in a plane crash, a certain gentleman mourned with the couplet: "Soared to heaven in one flight, three people shared the same fate," "Prostrated themselves on the ground, all four elements were empty," which was indeed accurate. Also, Wang Changchun's elegy for Xu, "All four elements are ultimately empty, looking down on the mortal world like straw dogs," "Floating life is truly like a dream, reaching the highest heaven and the lowest hell," was even more filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Movie Talk</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on "Gaslight"</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>In the spacious old house with flickering gaslights, a grey mist covered everything, unable to dissipate, forming such darkness. The darkness was heavy, with a muffled cry everywhere. By the icy hearth, solidified shadows, a damp street, a silent hall, a winding staircase, footsteps from the back of the house, and even the people in the murals glared with murderous eyes. It is this mysterious atmosphere that shows the panic, loneliness, and nervous stimulation of a weak woman, and it is also this atmosphere that makes one feel that marrying a husband like this is truly heartbreaking for a woman. In terms of creating a strong, dense color, director George Cukor is undoubtedly successful. After "Camille," "A Double Life," and "Little Women," he has established a new milestone. Because having seen "Suspicion" and "Gaslight," we feel that the psychological stories of murder cases between couples were originally meaningless and have now become clichés. The special excellence of "Gaslight" is entirely due to the director's handling and the actors' acting skills. With flexible camera work, George Cukor consistently depicts the silent climax. He does not film the struggle head-on like ordinary directors, preserving the literary atmosphere, and he always cleverly uses sound to skip the fighting scene. However, for some reason, he even eliminates the development of the climax, so that the ending takes a sudden turn.</p>
<p>The most remarkable is still Ingrid Bergman's acting, which every movie audience must see. To be honest, Ingrid Bergman made few achievements in "Casablanca" and "The Bells of St. Mary's," and even failed in "Suspicion." This is the first time she has shown us the invincibility of her skills. No wonder she won the 1944 Academy Award for this, and no wonder she considers this film her masterpiece. I used to think that Joan Crawford's determination in "A Woman's Face" was rare, but now I know that Ingrid Bergman has even more charm and gentleness. Recently, after watching "To Each His Own," I felt that Olivia de Havilland understood middle-aged business women, playing the mental state of three ages with great realism. In the second half, after crying, she held her face in her hands in front of the friar and the viscount, which was purely inspired and amazing. But when it comes to Olivia's overall acting, it always seems difficult to draw a conclusion. Ingrid Bergman here, however, makes people applaud without hesitation. She not only gradually and meticulously portrays the psychology of a person whose nerves have been overstimulated to the point of weakness, expressing the dazed, weak, dreamlike state, but also the fluttering dance when playing the piano, the goose-necked arms when kissing, the disappointed gestures when handing over the painting after asking for help on the stairs. These movements all have a very quick, flexible, and harmonious beauty, like a drooping flower. The lines are also read with rhythm, with both slowness and speed. Some stars can match her depth, but they often lose sight of one thing while focusing on another, unable to be complete. Therefore, I dare say that Ingrid Bergman has defeated Greer Garson in "Madame Curie" with this role.</p>
<p>I can't forget the song "The Last Rose of Summer" in the film. Beautiful girls are all roses, but the person who treads on the jade and tramples on the flowers is autumn after summer. Roses cannot withstand time, and once it passes, they wither. Fortunately, the Sheila in "Gaslight" did not pass autumn, but still exuded a fragrance after the summer.</p>
