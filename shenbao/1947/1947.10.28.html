<h3>外部與美使館雙方照會全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕中美救濟協定，廿七日下午四時在京簽訂，茲誌外部致美大使館及美使館覆我外部之照會如下：</p>
<p>外部美大使館照會　涇啓者，關於中美兩國政府代表本日簽訂之中華民國與美利堅合衆國關於美利堅合衆國救濟援助中國人民之協定第二條（丁）款，及第九條　項，雙方瞭解中國政府有權決定其武裝部　之數額及其供給該部隊使用之糧食及其他物齊之數量，自應完全承認，上述協定之核准，並不影　此項權利。但在另一方面，依照授權供給救濟援助之第八十屆國會所通過之第八十四號法案，無論何時，美國總統如認爲美國供給任何國家人民之救濟物資　或當地所產或自國外輸入之同樣物資，有過多數量用於幫助維持該國之　裝部隊情事，得終止美國救濟援助之供應。　於該數濟法案中此項規定，美國政　如認爲救濟物資或當地所產或自國外　入之同樣物資有過多數　用於　持在華之武裝部隊時，必需保留其終止輸送救濟物資前往中國之權，以上係貴我兩國政府之相互瞭解，並構成上述協定之一部份，相應照達，即希査照，並予以證實爲荷，本次長代理部務順向貴大使重表敬　。此致美利堅合衆國駐中華民國特命全　大使司徒雷登閣下，劉師舜，中華民國　六年十月廿七日。</p>

<h3>周以德即飛京　在平發言力主援華</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕美衆　査　告，在國會中殆成爲對華政策之重要參考；周氏主張：　援華援歐，同樣迫切，且援華所費代價較援歐爲少。　即使魏德邁報吿書不發表，至少其建議，　予發表，俾美人民明瞭何以需要援華？魏氏亦爲主張援華者，惟因在華時間較短，恐尙有欠明瞭處。　一部人人以中國政府「不民主」，故主　報援華，實則任何內戰國家，均不華保持民主，並免除其他弊端。此時若不援華，將來恐再想援華亦晚矣。　中國不安，朝　問題亦難解決。</p>

<h3>新疆局勢的新展望</h3>
<p>在報紙上最近所見到的關於新疆的消息，很遺　的，不能不說是相當矛盾。據聯合社南京廿二日電，謂新疆叛亂已死灰復燃·迪化北面二百五十哩之承化，已被伊寗叛軍佔領；同時，該社從伊寗傳來的報道，則謂伊寗方面正耍求完全　立，且準備用武力爭取。在道個時候，新疆籍府委鮑爾漢夫人適自迪化飛抵首都，向新聞記者談稱：「新疆一切平靜，安定如恒，並無外傳之混亂事件發生」。恰巧張治中將軍九月一日致伊寗阿合買提江之公開信，於同時時獲得答覆；伊方提出四點，作爲談判先決條件。此一答復，據府委鮑爾漢的談話，表示伊寗方面願意重開談判之門，對於新疆和平，深有裨益。究竟新疆情形如何，當爲國人所關心。我們綜合各方報道，以爲新疆局勢，縱尙未能完全回復安定，但叛亂情勢，亦未必有如外國通訊社所傳那樣的嚴重，而且就最近的趨勢看來，新疆局勢，也很可能好轉。</p>
<p>誠如府委鮑爾漢所言，伊寗方面答復的提出，表示談判可望重開，此對於新疆局勢的安定，實屬不無裨益。原來新疆的局勢，自經張治中將軍秉中央之決策，先後成立伊寗糾紛事件和解條款正文及附文以來，本已踏上新的途徑：其奈叛亂突起，省府副主席阿合買提江旣自立伊寗，阿山區專員烏斯滿又被逐承化。一時原可粗安之新疆局勢，至此血又吿破裂。如今烏斯滿收復阿山，伊寗方面的答復，却於此際提出，此實是一件使人足以尋味的事。</p>
<p>溯自三十三年冬伊寗事變後，該區形成半獨立局面。張治中將軍主張，一本開明寬容，却未能改變「分裂派」頑强的熊度。雖然其間有和平條款的簽訂，但和平並無保障，塔城阿山兩區終爲伊寗所侵，造成新疆邊境半壁的分裂。今年六月五日白塔山專件的發生，便是伊寗方面玩弄耆日吳三桂借兵伎倆，準備在新疆燃起滿天烽火，造成更大的分裂和紛亂。看幾月來的事實，政府對新疆問題的處理，有決心，有辦法，以及維哈各族的誠心內向，新疆人民反分裂情緒的高漲，「分裂派」的陰謀是失敗了。</p>
<p>收復阿山區的烏斯滿爲哈薩克族中毛尼喀族首領，在新疆有哈族民族英雄之稱·和平條款以後，鳥出任阿山區專員，因不滿「分裂派」活動，遂與伊寗不睦，全區卽被叛軍佔領，烏於無可奈何之境，乃率部退出白塔山，整飭精銳，立志收復承化，重見中華領土完整的光明。阿山地屬戈壁阿爾泰山系，與蘇蒙邊境接壤，自被叛軍攻陷後，伊塔阿鼎足有三，高揭「東土耳其斯坦」之旗。意圖特殊化，白塔山事件的爆發，是特殊化露骨發展的表喪；阿合買提江等的離開迪化，更爲「分裂化」不合作熊度的表現。張治中將軍曾警吿阿合買推江，希望返回迪化重開談判：麥斯武德主席決定以實現民主建設，爭取新疆各族人心。兩月來，新疆民選的熱烈，經濟建設的佈署，收　了極大前效果。伊寗人民不堪專制統治，紛紛走向迪化　阿山人民不滿橫征暴歛，級紛求援烏斯滿。値此時會，烏斯滿以不這血手段收復承化，重見阿山區光明，伊塔已　孤立命運，如不自　自覺歸來，必爲人民所棄，民族所厭，殆無</p>
<p>在　些情形下，我們看見有伊寗方面答覆公布。無論他們對於回復新疆的安定有無誠意，談判旣可希望重開，我們願新疆主政的當局如張治中將軍者，能够早日返任，對於我們西北的邊防能夠好好部署整頓一下。中國的對與新疆，本革命之三民主義，以協和各民族爲前提，這不能不說是我們的開明政策；就是國外的報紙，如紐約的前鋒論增報，亦以爲中國政府予該省以廣泛之自治，普通過幹練之張治中將軍舉行談判，實爲睿智寬大之措置。我們同時希望新疆各民族，特別是伊寗方面的當局，也能够抛棄成見，從若千國家的陰謀中超脫解放出來，來共謀新疆局勢的一新。</p>

<h3>國代聯誼會　上蔣主席書</h3>
<p>（上接一版）國民政府主席蔣鈞鑒，依照國民大會所決議之憲政實施準備程序，本年內須　辦大選，於十二月廿五日召開國民大會，實施憲政，自應如期辦理，以重大法，惟憲政實施首重大選必須合乎憲法及行憲法規各種規定，審愼將事，力求確切，昭示來茲，未可因限期迫促，祗求如期完成而　就事實，因陋就簡，忽略規定，致使憲政始基，置於沙漠之上，徒開選舉之惡例，而貽奸人之口實。茲據湖南·廣東·汕頭等省市代表發表書面意見，湖北·江西·四川·河南等省，亦有審愼辦理選舉之決議。洞察時艱，困難滋多，各地先後來京代表對此意見曾作多次之交換，總其要點，有如下述：　東北·華北現被共匪整踞滋擾，共計廿二省市，戰亂時期實難進行選舉，職業代表法律明定爲全國選舉，此等地區如因事勢困難，而採取遴　指定等辦法，則不惟剝奪一部選民權利，且將招各方之抨擊。如暫不舉辦，則不能　足準備程序第八條　額三分之二之規定，且所謂三分之二者，係全國同時進行，選　期中如有因故不能及時選出，但有三分之二以上之選出，即可開會，並非置三分之一於不　。單獨以三分么二選舉，即可開會，此種法理少認識，不能不愼重於事先，以免事後之糾紛。　北方各省遍地烽火，人民在流　死亡之中，北方各省地方秩序尙未恢復戰前狀態，本年內黃潦爲患，災區廣博，加以徵兵徵糧，負擔　東，平民生活痛苦不堪。此時辦理大選，中央地方所耗資費每一省市動需數百億或數十億。此種直接間接重負，必將影響金融，累及民生，爲社會所不能擔負。　勦匪戡亂，爲建國之先務，在此動員之時，自應集中一切力量，一鼓蕩平共匪，始可確立憲政基礎。値此人心惶惶，伏　潛滋，如因競選劇烈，引起社會糾紛，影響戡亂大計，必使親者痛而仇者快。　全國綏靖區城，面積非小，在表面上雖已安靖，而潛伏殘匪，隨處活躍，若在此等區域進行普選，反爲奸人所利用。　先辦安定之省區而緩辦匪區選舉，短期內勢難召開大會實施　　政，即不能實現政府還政於民之初心，而新舊代表新舊立監委員同時並存，尤容易引起　域之見，重演民國初年新舊國會之爭論，妨礙政治之統一。　動員戡亂之際，全國將士奔馳前方，爲國宣勞，在此戎馬倥　之中，無暇參加選業，使其無法行使其應享之權利，殊欠公允。　此次立法院規定各省市區立法委員名額，係以十六年至廿五年間各省市區所報戶口最多一年之數爲準，而戰後各地人口數目變動甚劇，未及情査，欲於倉卒數月之中，粗製濫造，手續不能完善，不惟不足以昭鄭重，口將引起各方責雖。　在短期內辦理全國選舉，事務上，技術上，皆難周到，徒辦各級政府之困難，即欲力求完善，而事實困難無法克服，決非上級一紙空文即可奏效。　本年國民大會召開日期，雖爲上屆大會所決定，但現在時勢已變，與去年開會所預期六個月內大局可以澄淸者不同。歷觀各國憲政之例，情於國基穩定之後，開始憲政，絕無在內亂未息之際，粉飾太平，促進選舉之事例，不宜膠柱　瑟，招刻舟求劍之　。再者各地辦理選舉，糾紛迭起，人心浮　，險象環生。長此影響所及，適足以阻礙憲政實施，動搖民主基礎，展望前途，殊堪把憂。綜上所述，或選民人數不確，或影響戡亂進行，或招致社會紛擾，若不力求切實解決，則本國長治久安之憲政，反成招致　亂，滋擾之　果，　國家以隱　，負國民之期望。代表等體察國情，盱衝時勢，認爲實施憲政之準備程序乃制憲國民大會所決定，非全體代表重新決議，任何機關不得變更，但就目前事實觀之，則有重行商討，愼重辦理選舉之必要。代表等思考再三，惟有呈請鈞座依法召開國民大會臨時會議，藉以奠定憲政基礎，促進民主政治實施，則國家前途實深利賴，臨電不勝迫切待命之至。</p>

<h3>外籍軍事家看東北戰局　美國援助緩不濟急</h3>
<p>（路透社南京廿七日電）此間外國軍事觀察家幾一致公認國軍在東北之局勢，實難爲助。據某一地位極高在華有十五年經驗之外國觀察家稱：縱使美國之援助，成爲事實，對於東北戰局亦極少即時性之影響。美國之援助，可以激發士氣，但不能贏得勝仗。美國假使於明日即決定以財政及軍事援助給予中國，而美國工業亦立即恢復戰時生產，但第一批子彈抵達東北國軍之槍膛以內，至少當在六個月以後。東北交通之殘缺，爲一決定性之因素，此乃國軍在東北所面臨之最大阻碍。余嘗見一百哩長之一段鐵路，從頭至尾悉遭破壞，政府官員承認鐵路枕木已無存底，在許多月內無補充之可能，在政府搶條乏鐵路上，枕木間之距離，恒達三碼以上，因此减少其載重量。目前冬季即將來臨，建設工作不久將全部陷於停頓，以言迄至目前爲止美國給予中國之軍事援助，在運至中國以前，均已被擱置太平洋之島嶼上，聽其腐朽，此皆由於新供應品之缺乏，供應來源，不正常之故。另一外國觀察家稱：共方所用太部份武器係日製，乃日人於戰時遣下者；至於訓練工作，則無疑的有蘇聯人員從事組織並訓練，此等人員先在俄國受訓，然後返賺東北，蒙共及韓共所用之戰時，可以證明前語之不　。另一外國觀察家述及美國以財政及軍專援助給予中國之可能性時，認爲美國之援助已屬不可進免？問題乃在中國政府是否能接受借款之條件。渠料王外長此次自美歸國，囊中必携有此等條件。述及共方東北發動之第六次攻勢時。渠料共軍有於冬季來臨前變動全力攻勢之意。</p>

<h3>中美救濟協定全文</h3>
<p>中華民國與美利堅合衆國關於美利堅合衆國救濟援助中國人民之協定。</p>
<p>茲因美利堅合衆國意欲對中國人民給予救濟援助，使其免受苦難，並得繼續切實努力，以求恢復元氣；</p>
<p>又因中國政府曾向美國政府請求救濟援助，並曾提供情報，使美國政府深信中國政府返需援助，以獲得中國人民生活之基本必需品；</p>
<p>又因美國國會曾以一九四七年五月三十一日第八十屆國會第八十四號法案，規定對於總統認爲確係需要此項援助國家之人民，而各該國家對於該項國會法案所需之救濟計劃，會作滿意保證者，供應救濟援助；</p>
<p>又因中國政府與美國政府均願確定關於處理及分配美國救濟物資之若干條件及瞭解，並規定兩國政府合作之一般辦法，以便適應中國人民之救濟需要；</p>
<p>中華民國政府由劉師舜爲代表，美利堅合衆國政府由司徒雷登爲代表，議定條款如左：</p>
<p>第一條　物資之供　應</p>
<p>（甲）給予援助之計劃，應包括各種類別與各種數量之物資，以及有關該項物資之取得，儲藏，輸送，船運等服務，由美國政府依照一九四七年五月三十一日第八十屆國會第八十四號法案，及其修正或補充之任何法案，於諮商中國政府後，隨時決定之。此項物資，應以若干生活基本必需品爲限，即糧貪，　藥用品，已製成及未製成之衣料，肥料，病虫　　劑，燃料及種子是。</p>
<p>（乙）除第三條另有規定外，美國政府對於依照本協定所供給之美國救濟物資與服務，將不作償付之請求，並無要求償付之勝利。</p>
<p>（丙）美國救濟物資之取得，儲藏，輸送及船巡赴華等服務，將由美國政府機關辦理，但經美國政府規定以他種方法，依照美國政府所規定之手續，辦理此等服務者，不在此限。所有美國救濟物資，除美國政府特准在美國境外取得者外，應在美國境內取得之。</p>

<h3>搜查封存　非抑平物價基策　商會呈請市府　保障合法營業　慎重檢查使各業得安定</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕上海市商會爲紙業所存報紙數量，僅及戰前百分之卅，並無囤積情事，請予平情處置，並保障合法營業事，電呈市政府，略稱：「近年物價一經波動，各方輒認爲致此之　結，在於存有貨囤積不售，而當局受輿論之責難，亦恒以搜查封存，爲抑平物價惟一之對策。良以物價騰責，有政治經濟諸種原因，成份複雜，未易處理，惟搜查囤積，則一紙公文，十數警吏，立可辦到‘，其事一經公佈，又可稍平輿論之責望，是以不暇研究其眞相如何，囤積之界說安在，凡規模稍大，存貨較多之商號，輒首受打擊。屬會以爲凡百商業，有批發發，有零售，除攤販性之流，或者每日隨脫手隨進貨之外，其餘即係門售商店，亦無不　進一批，分期銷售。至於進貨存貨或多或寡，則以資金之厚薄，銷售之旺淡而殊，原無一定數量，即法令亦無明文。年來國內國外，交通均不及戰前之便利，訂貨一批，均非刻期可到，而進口商品，每產限額，又復不同，且有逐漸减少之處，则稍留餘地，以免來源缺乏，靑黃不接時之恐慌，從民生立論，實亦有益而無損。戰後商人資力，遠較戰前爲薄弱，綜其手中存貨，就大體立論，必遠較戰前爲少。但戰前存貨雖多，並不干犯禁綱，現在則動輙得咎，豈眞法令今昔異殊，亦無非以物價關係，易爲衆矢之的而已。</p>

<h3>五迷四殺三獎　一個匪幹坦白供述</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日航訊〕最近，有曾任共匪山東省府奮西行署文敎科長的匪幹岳修網，因匪區近舉行一種所謂「複查」：「澈蘇淸洗幹部，淘汰地主出身的幹部，肅淸不穩份子，嚴整共黨陣營」，於是，不僅將岳修網在壽張同莊原籍的祖產鬥爭得一乾二凈，把他的父親抑起來，使全家十餘口陷於無衣無食，乞討爲生，並進而對「革命六年」的岳修綱本身，亦認爲「思想動搖」，欲加捕殺，岳因鑒於共匪過去所一再强調的「鬥爭合理合法，抗屬要照顧好」，已經成了一種具文，如今旣述革命老幹部的家也要被鬥爭，與其坐待捕殺，倒不如「來濟投誠」，「坦白個人失身罪過，聽候國法制裁」，來得有利於國家，亦較有益於自身了。　岳修綱在向此間綏靖區投誠時，對「解放區」內部一切設施，可謂「坦白」得畢露無遺，但其中記者認爲特別値得重視，而應予揭發的是：八路對於靑年所用的「迷魂湯」，亦即所謂「控制靑年術」，其術如下：</p>
<p>五迷　　官迷—「當八路即可坐高官一，以誘利祿黨心的靑年。　財迷—「幹八路有錢花」，過去有「虛布」，今天有的是「抗幣」或「北海票」。　色迷「幹八路有美妻」，八路專門訓練了大批婦女「以肉體作為革命的犧牲」來迷惑靑年。　地迷「耕者有其田」，「窮人大翻身」，誘致窮人入圈套。　書迷—翻印馬列書籍，以黨染純潔青年。</p>
<p>四殺　四殺：　地主殺—「地主就是罪惡」，殺無赦，同情地主者是「立塲不穩」，也得殺。　貪污殺—匪幹部之貪汚者殺。　叛變殺—「妥協就是投降」，「不革命就是敵人」，「動搖就是叛變」，殺無赦。　特務殺—右傾是「國特」，左傾是「托派」，殺無赦。</p>
<p>三獎　名醫獎—印有獎狀，分一等功臣，二等功臣，三等功臣，由幹部開會評定。　物質獎—有手巾，肥皂，牙刷，書籍之類。　升級—根據成績，評定升級資格。　據岳君說：此種五迷四殺三獎，實際上不外欺騙，威脅，殘暴，和利誘。而在後方不了解匪區實際內情的靑年，受了馬列書籍的誘惑，多如中古時代的殉道者一樣，不辭道遠，千山萬水，跋涉到「解放區」去。</p>
<p>結論　在他們的想像中，開始時復認為「解放區」是「天堂」，誰知道他們被騙路進了「解放區」後，會在莫須有的「妥協」「不革命」「動搖」甚至「國特」「托派」等罪名下，無辜地竟被送入了「天堂」呢？誰又知道多少靑年，並且是在共黨中已具有悠久歷史和功績的幹部，在此次「複查」中，會被縛上十字架，真的送入了「天堂」呢？　岳修綱在結束他對「解放區」內部的「坦白」的最後結論是：「中國共產黨，所走的路綫是「共產」，「共窮」，「共死」，真共到整個民族國家的毀滅以死。」（特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>美富商願捐助　世運選手乾糧</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿六日電〕「星期書報」今日戰稱：美國高商多人，自顧　款五萬物購　乾糧，以供明年出席世界運動會各航　國家選手之用。美商代表特洛林數週前已與此間世運籌備委員會要員進行晤談，尙未切實解決，現仍繼續　商中。英國與歐洲各國選手，如能在會前月餘獲得額外配給，競爭必更劇烈。同時，世運籌委會會長勃來在「星期時報」撰文評稱：一二胆怯之徒，認爲英國太窮，無法盡地主之誼如戰前然，故不宜承辦世運會，但各國嘉資來英，決非覓取指摘之資料，世運會乃全世界不應自秉之真正希望，常人共同了解之真正蒸　，即在此一人類交際與勞力場所。</p>

<h3>大戶斬售者多　華股初昂後疲</h3>
<p>華股昨晨穩午疲，交易零落，恍惚中業内大戶，忽現不安，頗多斬售者。掉期迫近，意與不無打擊，是以熱股未免小疲，雜股則榮辱並不一致，商務新亞漲達限度，但後者午後未有成交，前途恍惚。</p>
<p>晨初</p>
<p>以貸款消息未見　佈，而大鈔卻有立委之有利言論而見高，永　開後即升至三〇六元及三〇九元，旋回小至三〇二元及三〇四元，維拉高而至即交三〇九元，遞交三一二元高價。商務兩次掛漲停，加之外股見俏，尙有盤旋，塲外息價開一角六分半及二角一，仍屬　旅，後以有力售現永紗者，乃迫低至即交三〇〇元光景，遞交三〇二元。時外股挺進，近午升至三〇四元及元〇七元，午收爲三〇二元及三〇五元，各股除大通冷落少勁，獨跌甚多外，均見起色。結果較上週六，即交股計永紗信和美亞新光　與華豐新華華新榮豐中絲微升，國貨內衣　一成，景綸中紡升半成，新亞商務漲停，大通跌一成，景福中法統益平平，　安信誼小挫。遞交股動興平平，景福微降，餘均微升。</p>
<p>後市</p>
<p>上塲時散買聲　不壯而難持久，加之交易淸　，更難久持。開後由高而低，夜報載有中美救濟協定在京簽字之訊，尙無多大影響，惟業中大戶頗現煩燥，多奮售即交永紗，國行交換差進，三時後，步降至即交二九〇元，遞交二九四元低價。經拉上少許後，而以二九一元及二九五元之價收市。結果與晨收相較，即交股中除中紡跌半成外，餘者升沉甚　，　交股亦榮辱互見，塲外各老股漲起少許。</p>
<h3>統債續吿猛漲　外股升後有回</h3>
<p>公　昨證劵帮意興　豪，續吿猛漲，成交仍旺，達二千萬左右。統丙　開二一五〇〇元，低價二〇六〇〇元，高價選二九七〇〇元，而後稍定。結果較上週六計甲乙升四千二，統丙暴騰六千六，丁戊各漲三千五。</p>
<p>外股昨漲後有回，惟紙業因有一股半可掉換中國紙版股一股之訊，奇　突起，竟暴漲達四成之多。熱股榮辱互見，冷股則頗有軋漲者。怡紗晨開在二十萬關口，低價一九四〇〇〇元，高價創二〇四〇〇〇元。午刻因港申電回升至六元七而稍回。午後證劵　忽吿怯疲，回挫至一八九五〇〇元結束，紙業創六三〇〇〇元左右高峯，結果較上週六計紙業漲四成，祥　　植升一成，業　跌半成，怡　跌一成，英聯航業鋼　微升，怡紗會德　　挫。</p>
<h3>食米逐步見低　雜糧汕市均略挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬四千七百餘石，晚稻均已登塲，南路早薄　來貨漸湧，市化仍懈，人心不振，逐步低落。粳米回挫萬元，秈米亦然少神。自元疲挫，陰元來源驟增，銷路見呆，猛跌二三萬元。新早薄稻新粳狂跌二三萬。</p>
<p>麵粉波動甚烈，平市上漲，午時轉跌，形成　進疾退。　皮初堅後回，亦少上落。</p>
<p>豆餅交易　少，暫無　　。黃豆汕廠納胃冷懈，本街依然閒散，以到　稀少，市勢平定，惟杜黃則來貨漸多，　低萬元。　豆汕頭台灣選高納取，靑島亦有問津，高貨去化俏俐，轉漲二三萬元，中下亦升萬元。</p>
<p>豆來去兩稀，價無變化。　豆汕頭　進，趨勢挺站。赤豆彷彿，崇明新沙赤豆，昨日尙爲初見。紅糧散戶不動，回跌萬元。苞米北洋仍懈，　見萎　，下跌萬元。芝蔴油廠停辦，本街揀巧略進，回跌二萬元。生仁廣帮停辦，零化甚細，呆滯之極，狂瀉七八萬元。</p>
<p>油市供者衆多，求者稀寥，生豆汕均挫三五萬元。菜油亦跌五六萬元，蔴油跟跌三五萬元。</p>
<h3>棉紗議價又提高　二十支掛一八九〇萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會棉紗議價，昨又調整，廿支紗議價照原定議價又提高百分之五，每件掛一八九〇萬元。其他各支紗，仍按比例並察酌市况，分別酌定。</p>
<p>中國紡建公司，昨日循例售紗，共售各支紗一五二九件，合廿支紗二〇五七件，全部售予廠商，申請者共四九三戶。</p>
<p>紗價挺秀</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，交易頗冷落，嗣以紡調會配紗廿支紗又提高，人心先軟後堅，市氣挺秀。結果四二支藍鳳紗比週六步升四十萬，爲三千三百九十萬元</p>
<p>棉布回降</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開平庸，旋以納戶懈怠，採辦甚稀，結果十二磅各　細布回降一，二萬至三，四萬元。</p>
<p>現棉平穩</p>
<p>昨日現棉，市况平穩，價格無甚軒輊，交易尙旺，紗廠亦有進意，同業瓦有進出，全日成交一千三百包，又一百擔。定廠價做開山東脫力司三四七萬，歸德三八〇萬，太倉三〇六萬，成交五二〇包，一百擔。</p>
<h3>人造絲平疲　綢貨稍形挫輕</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上午行情，比上週末稍堅。一二〇號旭字有光即期做八千三百萬元，隔日期做四百萬元，午後因絲織業配貨價减低，故喊價漸吿下降，由三萬元最後降至七千九百萬元　出價，比上　六軋短一百萬元</p>
<p>廠經喊價未見鬆動，高零担即期價六千二百萬元有交易，干經喊價與上週末相仿。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市稍形疲軟，　絲被面大誠與華強貨，開市成交價在二千三百十萬元左右，收市隔日期做三十萬元。</p>
<h3>人造絲牌價　中信局決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局本月廿七日至下月一日人造絲牌價，　經決定如次：計東洋大富貴一A六〇八六萬元，二A五九六四萬元，三A五七八二萬元，四A五四七八萬元。天橋一A六〇五〇萬元，二A五九二八萬元，三A五七四六萬元，四A五四四四萬元。其他一A六〇一四萬元，二A五八九四萬元，三A五七一二萬元，四A五四一二萬元。</p>

<p>又訊：據悉，日人絲二千二百五十箱，已於昨日抵埠，中信局第四十五次配售絲織業，第三十次配售織帶業，亦於昨日開配，共核配人絲二百三十箱，各檔配　聞較上週均減低半成左右。</p>
<h3>綠茶買氣濃厚</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶外銷花色，並不活潑，本年度炒靑烘靑等綠茶，本街店莊及客帮各路，胃納仍貪，其他各茶需求者亦屬不惡，買氣依然濃郁。惟成交數量狹窄，行情則益覺錄鋩。</p>
<p>外銷陳茶　繼續標賣</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中信局所存之　額外銷陳茶，自絡　公開標　以來，雖已數次，迄目前爲止，尙有四千餘　左右，聞其中紅茶佔六半，茲定於本月卅繼續拍賣，故　來午昌新華等出口商，均前往　看茶樣。</p>
<p>食糖疲</p>
<p>昨繼市以業中銀根仍緊而買銷少動，價乃復跌。公會劃　三八期綫單二四粗白價爲一百〇二萬八千元至三萬元，現貨二〇中砂白較平，爲九十八萬元至九十六七萬元。午後非正式交易，二四組白已進百萬大關。</p>
<h3>棉紗配銷循序推進　棉紡公會保持緘默</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會某負責人昨談稱：棉紗聯合配銷辦法綱要，自全經會通過後，本會正積極按照旣定程序推行？配銷委員會委員人選，業已內定，俟召開紡調會委員會議核定後，配銷委會即可成立，同時草擬聯配實施細則云</p>
<p>六區棉紡公會昨日召開臨時會議，王啓宇主席。王氏即席轉達陳部長日前約晤時之意見，旋即進行討論，該會對討論內容，保持緘默。</p>
<h3>本年度外棉進口額　不得超過一百萬包</h3>
<p>〔華聯社南京二十七日電〕據悉：政府已決定木年度外棉進口限額，不得超過一百萬包，每包重量以美制爲標準，計重五百磅。全部外棉，總値據佔計結果，約値美金一億七千萬元。又央行亦曾與花旗銀行治妥，由該行學付美金四千萬元，購銷美棉二十三萬包，約定每月結匯十分之一，以十月爲期。</p>
<p>又訊，本市紡織業對於此事，認爲過於苟刻。蓋國產棉花供紡織用僅一千二百萬擔，僅龍供紡織業數月之用。且目前陝西河南蘇北等產棉區均有戰事發生，棉花之損失數量甚大。今僅以一百萬包外棉補充，事實上至年終時各廠將爲原料不足而無法生產云</p>

<p>敵產淸理工作，原訂本年底結束，惟標賣等工作，一時尙難辦竣，預計明年春間或可吿一段落。又九月份敵產變賣收入，繳入國庫者，共計一千億，仍超出政府預算一倍。</p>
<p>自備外匯到埠物資處理辦法公佈後，迄昨日爲止，仍無一家至該會辦理申請收購手續。而正式申請退回者，昨晨亦僅一家，退回之物，係小量之白報紙。</p>

<h3>申報與十大醫院聯合主辦　免費防勞X光檢查統計表　患活動性肺癆者占百分之一六·三</h3>
<p>本報與十大醫院聯合主辦之免費防癆X光肺部透視檢査，本年度曾舉辦兩期，業於六月底結束，申請者數逾萬人，其經指定日期及醫院後因故未去檢査者亦頗不乏其人，實際檢査人數計九千五百七十三人。承肺病中心診所代爲分析統計，其中有活動性肺癆者佔百分之一六·三。此百分率之高，誠出人意外，究其原因，實爲少數申請檢査者，固已自知其本身有肺癆嫌疑，欲藉檢査以求確定，故癆病之百分率因而增高。茲將分析與統計分誌於後：</p>
<p>（甲）肺癆程度</p>
<p>（乙）性別分類　　（丙）年齡分類</p>
<p>（丁）職業分類</p>
<p>綜觀上列統計，以二十歲至三十歲之階段，感染肺癆最多，四十歲以上危機較少，至檢査結果，患有心臟及其他病症者，計九十三人，占百分之一。心肺正常者，計七千九百二十人，占百分之八二·七。</p>

<h3>沉思</h3>
<p>— F.M.P.</p>
<p>情緖生活過於緊張，往往於身心有害。我們要享受真實，深切而恬的完美人生，便不能不運用一種平衡情緖的藝術——沉思。</p>
<p>沉思帶來的是怡悅安寗的心境，正如一個諦聽美妙的音樂，還視愉目的落霞，流憇靑翠的高山的人，在無意中所遇到的心境一樣。那是一稱驚訝而不操切，　慮而不伎求的態度。佛家所謂涅　（Mivana），伊壁　魯所謂怡靜（Atarixia），斯多亞派所謂「無煩惱」（Apathesia），莊子所謂坐忘，本來都是人生中可望而不可即的境界，在沉思中却能依稀接近。「游心虛靜之域，獨立萬物之表」，不正是沉思的寫照嗎？萬慮俱消，我見冥滅，不正是沉思的深趣嗎？斯實挪　曾說：「心如認識事物于永恒狀態中，也就參入永恒了」！永恒的感覺，正是心靈的無上事受。莊予所謂「天地與我幷生，萬物與我爲一」；孫綽天台山賦中所說的「渾萬象以冥觀，兀同體于自然」，也只是沉思的妙用，使心靈在永恒和廣漠的太空裏浮沉。</p>
<p>把沉思作爲一種人生藝術，不僅能給我們以安息，同時也能給我們以新生。專一而深入的沉思，是心靈的武裝，爲未來的工作而秣馬厲兵，養精蓄銳，使心力　健，活力洋溢。對於一切事物，在沉思的化學液裏，便能孕育出嶄新的價値　和朋銳的透視力。紛雜的回憶得到洗潔，粗糙的觀念得到琢磨；內在的心智，在沉思的肥　中，也能欣欣向榮，滋長不已！</p>
<p>但沉思可絕不意味着息交絕游，遺世獨立，與殘酷的現實脫離，與真切的經驗分手。相反地，是更進一步的深入現實，是更進一步的抓住經——由驗事物的表象透視到事物的本質，在整亂的現狀中看出牠們的右機關聯。使我們在平凡的生活泥沙裹，淘出眞理的金粒；在多樣的生活奇葩裏，採得趣味的蜜汁；在翻騰的人海風波裏，把穩行動的舵柄。實用主義哲學家威廉詹母士（William　James）曾說：「常常到幽靜的地方去，可以誘致透　的思維，而經常保持正確的觀點。作一番沉思，正像一個在人海中擠來擠去得不到出路的人，爬到南門上俯瞰整個人羣的趨勢，然後再下來照着正確的方向走」。這便是沉思的人生　實用價値。</p>
<p>文學，藝術，科學和哲學都得從沉思中創造，在沉思裏完成。劉勰的「文心雕能」有　思　：「文之思也，其神遺矣。故寂然凝　、思接千載，悄焉動容，視通萬里？吟詠之間，吐納珠玉之聲；　　之前，卷舒風雲之色。其思理之致乎？故思理爲妙，　與物遊」。想像的小鳥，奮　展翼，在沉思晴空裏，便如此作超絕時空、繽紛多姿的遨遊。而終至表現為光彩的藝術品。無論小說與詩篇，都必經沉思的培養而後可以開放爲燦爛的藝術之花！蘇聯偉大的小說家M蕭浴霍夫（靜靜的頓河底作者）最愛沉思，有一次他去釣魚、投下鈎絲以後，忽兩眼凝視水面，呆若木雞。如此沈　於思索竟達一個多鐘頭未　，　後趕緊回家，洋洋灑灑寫了一通宵。這可見小說家之需要深思了。詩，一班人或以為　乎熱烈，不尚潛思。但英國大詩人華滋渥斯却曾爲詩下定義道：「詩是甯靜中回憶出來的情緖」。壯麗的詩篇「失樂園」的作者密　頓，亦在沉思中完成他的詩章。　　大學卒業後，一直在他父觀由莊上整居了五年之久。他最初幾篇有名的詩，都是他漫步田間、游目聘懷，讓想像飛馳，　游思狂舞的結晶。其中有一篇以沉思（Il　Perserso）命題的詩，抒寫沉思妙趣，深得三味。其後雙目失明，他的偉大篇什，都是通過他心靈沉思的滌濾，口授其女兒筆錄的。</p>
<p>尼朵在「悲劇的起源」裹說藝術境界出兩種精神構成、一是夢（以日神亞波羅（Aplelo）象徵），一是醉（以酒神達阿尼蘇司（Dionysus）象徵），　前者是不盡的形象，一切造形藝術和圖　雕刻均屬之，後者是無比的毫情，一切動的剛性的藝術均屬之，如跳舞和音樂。尼采以爲這兩種精神　於一爐——深心的苦悶　鮮明的意象而呈現——便產生希臘悲據。尼采所謂夢的藝術正是沉思的藝術，心靈在遼廓的夢境裏，展現萬紫千紅明朗壯麗的形象，便構成沉酣博大的藝術；展現美麗悠雅溫柔多姿的形象，　構成如幽林曲　，如珠玉之　的藝術。深思是表現藝術，創造藝術的最好夢境。其實在醉的藝術中，也同樣有沉思的境界。在音樂中如員多芬的第三和第五交響曲，固然如「列缺霹靂，丘　搖崩」，令人「魂悸以魄動，驚起而長曉」；但他的第六交響曲則「　乎其如歡，邈乎如有思，　乎其如　，愁乎其如悲」，極溫柔委婉之致，正是如「一天雲錦，萬顆奔星」的沉思夢境</p>
<p>大畫家創造意象，沒有不躭于沉思的，在沉思中，便可以圓滿的觀照，完全的覺知，充分的想像。蘇東坡說畫竹當有成竹在雄。那就是說必在沉思裏浮現一偶「元氣充周，血脈條暢，痒疴呼吸，感觸神應」的意象，然後援筆操紙，一揮而就。元代大盡家黃子久終日只在荒山亂石，　木深　中坐，意態忽忽，人不測其寫何。又每往　中通海處，　急流轟浪；雖風雨驟至，水怪悲詫而不顧。他這樣在沉思裏體詠自然，圓融意象，所以他的畫便沉　變化，異造化同神奇。六朝時宗炳會論作　說：「萬趣融于神思」。匠心獨連的神思，正如奇妙的融爐，將宇宙的森羅萬象，陶冶變化，而幻現爲大女散花的奇景小同樣，在西洋。沉思也是藝術的妙諦。米開朗基羅（Michelangelo）曾說：「畫家不是用手而是用腦」。達文西（Leonatdo　da　Vinci）也曾寫道：「天才卓越的心靈，當其最不做外表工作時，最說于創造」！所以他作其傑作「末次的晚餐」時，坐在空白的油盡布前，癡呆不動者數日。因而大大地惹惱了命他作畫的寺中方丈，絮絮不休的責問道：「你要甚麽時候才工作」？他爲了報復這不息的困惱，不覺照了這貴人模樣　了尤達（Judas）的像。——美活動的精奧，乃在藝術家在如此沉靜的思慮中，構想足以表現心中主旨的圓滿意象。</p>
<p>科學哲學之需要沉思，實無庸　　。牛頓萬有引力的發現，是看見蘋果落地因而引起沉思；瓦特發明蒸汽機是看到熟水鍋的冲汽而開始構想；伏羅依德（Fcude）的潛意識學說也是目注水藻，游心沉思的收獲；現代的大科學家愛因斯坦更是終日沉思默想，他未成名時曾在瑞京國際專利局任特許證檢驗員，雖在辦公時間不許作私人工作，但他郤不時陷人極度的深思！愛迪生——這位空前的大發明家——也是常常沉思不已！他有一次排在大隊中領取東西，因爲他正沉思一個問題，等到輪到他問其姓名時，他竟瞠目不知所對！沉思得自己連姓名也忘了，其深沉可想而知。承先啓後的大哲學家康德，終其生沒有離開其出生地坎尼斯堡，在規律之生活中潛心沉思凡十五年之久，始完成其傑著「純粹理性批判」…………科學家和哲學家沉思的事例，真是太多了，我們無用多舉。事實上，科學和哲學如無沉思，則決不能有發現和發明。宇宙的萬象遷移，人生的變幻不測，社會的複雜無端，沒有發歸入裏，精細周遍的思維，又何能條分縷析，窺其究竟，朋其蘊奥，見其深廣？從而凝爲解　，發為學說以至肆彈應無　？</p>
<p>沉思是一種藝術，牠與曼思不同。沉思是追求客觀的真善美而暫時忘掉黏執的小我，有朗耀的光芒而無糾纏的情緖。是「萬物靜觀皆自得」，與程子所謂「鳳凰翔於千仞」的氣象。智　在沉思裏照映着光輝，有「月到天心處，風來水面時」，「珠懷澤自潤，玉孕山含蟬」的境界。同時經驗的總結也發閃出一匹照澈行動的光亮——和累斯沃爾坡爾說：「世界對那些思想的人是齣喜劇，對那些憑感情的人是　悲劇」。讓我們在沉思裏認識這喜劇的世界吧！</p>
<h3>辛克萊續寫鉅著</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>辛克業今年已經六十八歲了。他說：「我曾努力嘗試着想要改變世界。」第一個目標就是他父親所　營的酒精，當時他還在紐約學校事讀書。十四歲他考入紐約市立大學，並靠寫作生活。廿一歲時他結婚，非常貧困。從一九○一年到一九○六年，他寫了五本小說。「愛的巡禮」是他所寫的寓言，對於兩性問題有他自己的見解。他因傑作「屠塲」（The　Jungle）而著名。他已經出過六十幾本書，現在又出了八本藍納布德（Lanny　Budd）的冒險故事。第三本「龍　」（Dragon's　Tecth）獲得一九四三年的普利支獎金。最近所出的第八本名叫「總統的使命」（Presidential　Mission）他在　羅維亞（Monrovia）玫瑰園中早晨打字，三小時可打一千字到一千五百字。下午他就修正稿件。晚間他散步時，就思索後來的章節。他說：「現在我正在思索第九本的村料。」他正完成一本「巨人的力量」（AGiant's　Strength），道是一本關於原子彈之將來的戲劇。他說：「我相信社會化的工業沿着TVA綫發展是完全與自由民主的組織相符合的。沿着這條綫，我希望看見社會問題能得到解決」他的身體不高不矮，合乎平均的高度。眼睛是灰藍的，頭髮是灰色的。他的聲音很溫和。卓別麟很喜歡學他，因爲他「說話常帶着微笑。」</p>
<p>辛克萊是奇才。倘若他不是奇才，人家也就不會注意他了。有他一個，可以抵得普通的作家十歲個。他的　納布德系的小說鉅　自有他的讀者，銷舊十萬部是最少的。最近的這一本已銷到七十五萬部‘主人公南寗布德（Lanning　Prescoff　Budd）是大工業的承繼人，他生意做的很大華盛頓，倫敦，巴黎，柏林都有行銷經。他與　斯福做了朋友。總統希望有人能做特別危險的職業，他就找到藍納。藍納到納粹那兒去，得到許多軍事秘密，同時又做了一筆好生意。書中人物還有邱吉爾，赫斯，艾森霍華等。處景電動得很快，從海德花園變到唐寗街。</p>
<p>作者所寫的既是小說中活動的人物，又是歷史上的真實人物的還可以說是大胆的嘗試。</p>
<p>但「藍納布德小說」也有其失敗的地方。作者沒有神秘的力量使其小說可信，這一方面也許由於辛克萊缺乏創造力，一方面也許由於他寫得太快。辛克萊是個奇才，可惜他沒有時間好好地去訓練他的才能。他每年想寫一本書，因此常顯得不深刻。這也就是仲馬與斯坦達爾的分別。好在辛克萊不注重在藝術方面，與其注重形式，他是甯注意於內容的。</p>
<h3>作詩的條件</h3>
<p>— 東方蒙霧</p>
<p>蘇聯作家馬耶珂天斯基在「我怎樣寫作」一文裏，曾談到我們作詩的時候，有四個必需的條件，確可作爲一般詩作者的參考，故特抄錄如下：</p>
<p>一種唯有憑藉詩才能達到的社會任務的存在。所以詩必須有一種社會的「使命」。這兒就有一個常被忽略的，値得硏究的有趣的事情：那是詩人負起了那種社會的使命與實際地被給與的使命之間，並沒有多大的關聯。</p>
<p>對於你所代表的社會，你要有正確的知識，或者至少要有一種熱烈的情感；換句話說：你必要有堅決的態度　和確定的目標。</p>
<p>你必須有材料，詞　貯藏室，你心裏的貯藏室應該存貯着你必需的字　——各種明暢的，罕見的，新鮮的，簡鍊的，獨創的字　。</p>
<p>作詩的人須養成一種推敲字句的習憤。這種習慣完全是屬於個人的，而且要長年不斷的工作才能够養成。它包括普節，韵律，脚韵，想　，編排，風格，情節，詩尾，標題，佈局等等。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「可不是！那麽一點年紀，一宿之間……</p>
<p>「什麽？…點點年紀」？買沙夫聽我插口一問，臉上現出了一陣陰笑，可是一笑即收，似乎不願意我看見，接口說：</p>
<p>一我不渦是聽人說的。聽說這個殺人的「人妖」，年紀很輕，輕得叫人不敢相信，只有十五六歲；您想可能不可能？我的意思是說，這麽年輕的孩子，才十五六歲，就有即應一種不可思議的特殊能力，可以徒手殺人。聽說被他殺了的，每人都是一樣的　口，這個動作，好像是給他的同黨，留下一種什　秘密消息似的—那就是說，傷口的「同一性」，是一種階號，等到報上一發表，成是由大家把這消息傳開，他的同黨，—兩位伙伴—就可明白那是他所幹的工作，並且可以追踪探出他的所在地來」——買沙夫這麼分析着。</p>
<p>「這眞是有些神祕得不可思議」！我始終維持着一貫的態度，—裝佯　　：「真的有人看淸他只是一個十五六歲的孩子嗎」？　弟本來只有十二三歲我怕他也化了　，以這麽這問一句，翠性探聽一個明白。</p>
<p>「可也說不定，有幾個日本人，倒是承認他們所看見的「人妖」。是個年紀「不定的」；那個意思，是說好像年輕，又好像年齡很大」。買沙夫也有些恍惚似的</p>
<p>用兩種不同的聲調，把她和買沙夫的這一段對白，連說帶表情說到了這裏，剛剛　着小老虎問：「虎弟，當眞的被你幹掉了七八個嗎？」這句話還沒有完成，忽然門外傳來一陳梯他梯他的步聲。我們一聽。都知道是吳鼎元回來了；所以無形中把要說的話翦斷了。</p>
<p>鼎元因爲沒有恢復身體的健康，走起路來，好像兩條腿上　着鉛條似的，一步一拖。可是乍一進門，我們都注意到他臉上的神色十分緊張。</p>
<p>「消思可不大好！」鼎元一面脫去那件不倫不類的僧服，拉掉了頭上一些瑣瑣碎碎的神秘裝飾品，一面用很緊張的　口，這麼告訴我們。</p>
<p>在鼎一兀金家遭劫以前，他一直保特着英國式的紳士態度；行動有規律，說話有尺寸；精神雖然不怎麼飽滿，可也不怎麽萎靡。可要是拿他那時的姿態，與現在這付尊容比較一下，簡直是的後兩個人。現在的鼎元，不僅精神萎靡，簡直可以說十分的穨廢了。</p>
<h3>歷史的重演</h3>
<p>英國前首相　唐納先生有句名言：「欲范立政制、當以本國往事為衡；」所謂本國往事就指歷史。憲思就說政治是歷吏的蛻變，攪政治要從歷史體會治亂興亡之迹，　往而知今。</p>
<p>中華立國五千年之久，宗族，文化，風　自有其傳統，所以雖說歷史不會重演，但相類似相沿襄的地方很多，在不勝枚舉之中，我來舉出個最近的例子</p>
<p>民國三十四年八月，日本宣吿投降，我政府下一道命令，陳公博周佛海等　分任某某司令，一時輿論驚疑，那時我就相信政府諸公熟讀宋史，仿張邦昌封王故事，按宋高宗東京即位，張邦晶率　大政，高宗起先不加　責，封他爲同安郡王，五日一諸都堂，隨後被李綱上十　一疏，第一議就是　奸，張邦昌終於伏法，附逆諸人，相繼辯罪，政府爲防止僞組織割據反動，欲取故與，絕對是賢朋措施。至於張邦　雖受金對，仍不廢宋室位號，自稱「權政府」。汪兆銘摹仿前人，大胆的自對了所謂「國民政府代理主席」。</p>
<p>不提宋史也罷，提起宋史，實在觸目驚心，趙宋的天下，禍根祗於東北，第一期遼人侵略，第二期金人壓倒遼人，宋朝去了半壁江山，第三期元人崛起漠北，大好山河，淪陷幾及百年，奉勸同胞，動讀歷史，提高警覺！　魯氏</p>
<h3>紙上談蟹</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>蘇東坡詩：「空煩左手持新蟹，漫達東　嗅落英。」王安石詩：「海外珠　常入市，人間魚蟹不論錢。」唐寅詩：「地爐溢却松花酒，剛是溪頭拾蟹歸。」一年容易，　忽又過重陽，菊绽黃華，氣象變得蕭索。際此風淸天朗之秋，登高臨遠，痛飮茱萸。把酒持蟹，敲詩吟賞，未始不是三生樂事。目下烏靑大蟹雖早已擠擠於市塲間，無奈身價之昂，動輒萬金，委蟹令人有駭目怵耳之槪。一班靠死薪水來維持家計的朋友，終於祗能望「蟹」興嘆，徒呼負負而已。記得范石湖歸老田園後，有詩云：「無力買田聊種水。」交人下塲，往往會如此窮極無聊。目覩新蟹橫行，能不垂涎三尺？「買蟹」旣謂「無錢」，紙上何妨談說？望梅　餅，聊勝於無，因此我今天特地來寫些關於蟹的掌故。</p>
<p>據善於喫蟹者說：會喫的人，在未喫之前是一隻囫國的蟹，把蟹肉喫掉後，依蕉能裝拚成一隻囫園的蟹形，毫不勉强。這種工夫，就非得積數十年喫蟹經臉而加以鍛鍊不可。一般人喫蟹往往蟹殼和蟹肉嚼成一　糟。</p>
<p>蟹可說是害蟲的一種，在某個時期內情形更烈。平江紀事：「大德丁未，吳中蟹危如蝗。平田皆滿，稱殺蕩盡。」此種蟹又各　蟹，對於農作物非常不利。</p>
<p>關於描寫蟹的書卷，宋代傳肱曾作蟹　。高似孫會作蟹略，把蟹的視概，說得非常詳盡。</p>
<p>一般人喫蟹，約分：煮蟹，浸蟹，焞蟹，　蟹，　蟹，蜜蟹等。比較特別些的，洛陽人喜喫炒蟹，安徽人喜喫醋蟹，江西人喜　糟蟹，從前　燭高最喜喫　蟹，唐明皇喜喫練蟹。</p>
<p>荀子說：「蟹六跪而二　，」實際上是　誤的。我們可從沒見過八足的蟹。祗有漢武帝時，善苑國貫一蟹，長九尺，有百足四　。因名百足蟹，（見洞其記）但這是例外而特殊的，普通蟹　是八跪二螯。</p>
<p>最小之蟹名曰　，大如貨錢。（見廣志）又蟹：「明越溪　石穴中，亦出小蟹。其色赤而堅，俗呼爲石蟹。」蘇軾詩：「溪邊石蟹小如錢，喜見輪　赤玉盤。」所詠即此。</p>
<p>蟹肉果然鮮，蟹黃　脂尤覺肥美，根據蟹的生理，雄蟹含有蟹脂，相當於哺乳類的精要，雌蟹含有蟹黃，相當於哺乳類的卵巢。</p>
<p>蟹最怕游弱，吻類相感志云：「落蟹怕　，」說林也載：「今大霧中蟹多　者。」</p>
<p>木　子一名木蟹（見本草）其實眞正的木蟹是沒有的。</p>
<p>蟹也能飛翔，粤志：「飛蟹小者如錢，大者倍之，從海面飛越數尺，以螯為　」。</p>
<p>諺謂：「蝦　蟹　。一雖是預言，但蝦背傴僂，象工　荒。蟹身橫行，象徵戰亂，不無理由。</p>
<h3>太平天國三個女將</h3>
<p>— 湘若</p>
<p>「女兵」在中國並不是近代才有的事，但是提出女兵　一個名詞却的確是民十五北伐時才在「從軍日記」的作者—謝冰瑩女土　下出現的，這里我　為從軍人營的女兵們介紹三位太平天國的女將：</p>
<p>洪宣　傳：「金田起事，凡佔上帝會者，皆舉室以從。軍中婦女宣　部勒之，編爲軍，自稱元帥，朝貴每臨戰，宣嬌　騎馬，率大脚婦，服五色衣出隊爲掩護且能使火器，無　發，長沙之役，朝貴戰死，宣嬌代將其衆，得不潰」。（見太平天國野史卷十八）</p>
<p>蕭三娘傳：「太平軍中有蕭三娘，號女元帥，或云朝貴妹。年二十餘歲，長身猿臂，能於馬上指揮其衆，且能左右射。太平二年克鎮江時，當盔女兵數百登城，勇敢過男軍，當者無不拔糜」。（同上卷二十）</p>
<p>楊二姑傳：「楊二姑係轉王楊輔淸之妹，勇敢果決，勝於男子。……每遇戰陣，二姑輒以黃巾裏頭，繫大紅戰裙，與其夫並　而出，衝鋒陷陣，人莫能敵。又能於馬上擲刀刺人，百發百中。中者無不立倒。……自稱爲飛刀神手」。（同上卷頁三十九）</p>
<p>而且我們從王子二月三十日（時在永安）天王詔（見天命詔旨咨）中：「男將女將盡持刀，現身着衣僅替換。同心放胆同殺妖，金寳包袱在所緩。……男着龍袍女插花，各做忠臣勞汗馬」看來，更可知這些女將們和男子同立戰功地位是絕對平等的呢。</p>
<h3>尹文端公</h3>
<p>— 季明</p>
<p>淸人小傳之一</p>
<p>袁子才詩文集中，　言及尹相國，即女端公是也。子才平生愛臧否人物，獨於文端公無微詞，一則重師生之誼，一則尹公德操亦無可背　處，今試就正史所輯，傳其大節於次：</p>
<p>公名　善，遼元長，本姓章佳，滿洲鑲黃旗人。父尹泰觀世宗，問：「有子仕乎」？曰：「第五子尹　善　順天鄕試。」帝曰：「當令見我」。後公成進士，引見，帝喜曰：「汝即尹泰子耶？果大器也。」由是受知於世宗（維正）高宗（乾隆）兩朝，凡一督雲賞，三督川陜，四督兩江，任封疆大吏垂三十餘年，晚年，召入閣，兼管兵部事務，上書房總師傳，乾隆三十六年卒。</p>
<p>公貌白暂，少　　，　願大口，聲淸　　聞，遍體紅斑，鮮如珠砂，　褐五年，即任封張，年纔三十餘耳，嘗一月問，兼　將軍，提餐，巡撫，河漕，監政，上下兩江學政等官九印，而公判決恢然無餘牘，稍暇猶與諸生論文課詩，聞者駭服。</p>
<p>公恢宏大度，獎掖後進如不及。時袁子才　居　隨園，適當公兩江之任，故詩酒酬和，幾無處日，于才得享山林之樂，兼獲遠名者，公推戰之力居多，蓋淸代滿員，能以器識文章顯著如公者一二人而已。</p>
<h3>太陽的福氣</h3>
<p>— 起元</p>
<p>一九三三年　春間，蕭伯納來遊上海，正當春雨初　，太陽從黑塞間探出來的時候。於是便有人討好似的對他說：</p>
<p>「蕭先生，你福無真大，可以在上海看見太陽。」</p>
<p>他却不假思索，隨口回答道：「不，這是太陽的福氣，可以在上海　見蕭伯納。</p>
<h3>老與閑</h3>
<p>— 朱梅</p>
<p>我們中國過去的家庭教育是提倡，鼓勵裝老，一個才不過三五歲的小孩就得把他裝得來文質彬彬，有時道貌岸然，甚至老氣橫秋，不然便顯不出是有教養的書香子弟。年紀稍大一點，便以不做事—閑—爲光榮，做事就彷彿有點可恥，因爲閑得起的人才表明他是祖宗有德。似北平的提烏籠，蘇州的坐茶館，就是那種典型的最高表現。但是，話又得說回來，做官却叉是例外。這些情形，高鼻子綠眼睛的看法就稍稍不同。記得艾登被發表作外交部長的時候，那時他大約四十三歲罷，記者們都稱呼他作年靑的外交家。在我們大中國人看來，四十三歲的人，已够老了，有許多在自咦已到入暮之年了。要是六十歲還在作事就會有人笑他老運不濟，自己聽了後也彷彿覺得是一條勞苦命似的，因爲我們變了中國人就得閑才對。儘管美國人在三十六年度製造三七年式的汽車，反正我們的命好，有錢就可買來坐，自己何必用腦子，便宜都是我們佔。高鼻子綠眼睛以做事忙爲光榮，不做事到認爲是恥，他們眞是傻瓜。在倫敦也好，在巴黎也好，上班時候溜馬路的男人很少，焉路上以娘兒們最多。男人都在作工，除非他失了業，或者有專非要他溜馬路不可，我們中國的都市呢，無論在什麽時候總可看見滿街是男人溜着，要不然就睡在床上，十二點才起來，上等一點的使是養養魚，種種花，或者打打麻雀，那股子開勁實在令人　了佩服他有修養。彷彿聽誰說過，世界上如果每個人都做四個鐘頭的工，生產方面的工，就可以使每個人豐衣足食，這話想來不無道理。比如以上海一市來說，有近五百萬人口，這五百萬人口中眞正在生產的有百分之幾？可以說有限得很，如果這些閑人們都從事生產事業，能產生的東西有多少？以此類推及於全國，要每個中顯人豐衣足食不是一件很難的事，要使人幸福必須使得每個人愛工作，人一有了工作當然就不會閑，人一不閑便會覺得自己年靑和有用了。</p>
<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國小姐的敎育</p>
<p>毫無疑義的，美國的敎育是世界上最發達的，美國的女子敎育更是世界上最發達的，在第二次世界大戰期內，美國敎育給女子獨占了，男女兼收的大學裏，找不出幾個男生。男子都當兵去了，因爲男生奇缺，在大學裏非常吃香。我住在德士省的聖馬哥斯，那兒有一所德士師範大學，約摸有二千多學生，其中男性不足二十人，因此這粥粥羣雌，都想得此二十　男子而甘心，鬧得不可開交，這種現象，足以反映女子敎育之發達。美國女子在家庭地位與男子相等，所以受敎育的機會也是均等，從小學而中學，都由父母擔任　育費，一部分女子在由學時代已開始做工，找些零用錢，利用課餘擔擔家庭保姆，代人打字，常女招待，戲院收票員，相接員、雜誌推銷員；一進大學便多數是半工半讀。她們一方面當小學敎員或女招待之類，一方面在大學裏上課，生活相當勤勞，決沒有坐定心了專門求學的，所以美國女人的父母，在經濟方面的責任是並不是無限的，有些女子反而把工作所入，提出一部分貼補家用，大學女生很少　乎向父母要錢的。省立大學全期學費不過二多元，一個現代女性連這二十多元的學費都沒有本領轉回來，那她根本就不配做美國人。我的許多女同學，　利用暑假做工，可以維　半年　　一年的生活，她們並不希罕男友的經濟帮助，男朋友在經濟上的限度，至多是請吃飯　　　　，要有了特殊交情，才可貽贈衣飾，所以笑國女子不輕易呌男朋友買衣服，除非是訂了婚或同居了的。美國女子把敎育列爲生活之一環，而並不把敎育視作謀生工具，因爲大學裏　多七八十歲的老太太，她們並不在外謀生，也沒有進修以增加謀生技能的企圖，可是她們　攻攻上學，她們的成績比不上背年人，根本她們不重視學分，也不陶醉於學位，　　之年，縱值得了博士學位，也不好帶進棺材，她們把學校作爲修養人格之地，　教育有延年益壽之功，同時　　感到年紀大了，知識難免陳腐。得聽聽靑年敎授的高論，最後輩交換交換意見，惟有潔樣，才能跟着大時代前進，所以美國的老太婆知道中國的蔣委員畏是誰，中國的老太婆就不很知道　魯門是何許人了，要使中國女子敎育發達，還得開放學校的大門，中國有許多靑年女子因為經濟力量不够，被　於學校之外，七八十歲的老太　更不得其門而入，如果有一個老太　　了拐杖走進任何大學的敎室去　戀，怕不被校長敎授及同學們　出校門，就是：「像你這把年紀，不在家裏抱孫子，還到這里來討苦吃嗎？」</p>

<h3>The US and China Sign an Agreement in Nanjing to Enhance Friendship and Provide Relief - Materials Obtained</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on the 27th that the governments of China and the United States signed an agreement in Nanjing today stipulating that food and other forms of relief assistance will be provided to the Chinese people under the US Foreign Relief Program. Dr. Liu Shih-shun, Political Vice Minister and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed on behalf of China, and Ambassador John Leighton Stuart signed on behalf of the United States. The US Foreign Relief Program is designed to alleviate the suffering of people in countries devastated by war. The agreement signed today reaffirms the strong feelings of mutual friendship and sympathy between the two peoples and is another expression of the continued concern of the American people for the welfare of the Chinese people. The signing ceremony was held at 4:00 PM on the 27th in the reception room on the second floor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. On a long table adorned with purple miscellaneous flowers, covered with a white tablecloth and topped with a glass plate, were arranged a complete set of celadon stationery and two copies of the agreement, sealed with wax and tied with tricolored ribbons. Vice Minister Liu Shih-shun and Ambassador Stuart, attended by Chief of Protocol Ling Chi-han, Director of the American Affairs Department Tian Lin, Assistant Chen Shih-tsai, Assistant Wang Hsiao-hsi of the Treaty Department, Financial Attaché Adler of the US Embassy, Deputy Attaché Blin Giji, and Attaché Ander Pei, sat down and signed the agreement, affixing their names in both Chinese and English to the end of the Chinese version. A few minutes later, the signing was completed, and the two shook hands and chatted happily. Vice Minister Liu expressed his deep gratitude for the US's kindness in providing relief to Chinese refugees, and believed that it would enhance the friendship between the two countries. Ambassador Stuart humbly said that the assistance provided was insignificant, but that it would help promote the traditional friendship between China and the US. Finally, all the Chinese and American officials present took a group photo to commemorate the occasion, and the ceremony was declared complete. (See the main points of the agreement in this newspaper on the 18th, and the full text in the second page of today's newspaper.)</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] Although the exact figures for the relief supplies in the Sino-US Relief Agreement have not been announced, according to official sources, China will receive an estimated $30 million worth of grain, medicine, textiles, fertilizers, vaccines, fuel, and seeds. Stacking and transportation costs will be borne by the US side. The Chinese government and other organizations will be responsible for distributing the aid to people of all walks of life, regardless of race, religion, or political belief.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Exchange of Notes Between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US Embassy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The Sino-US Relief Agreement was signed in Beijing at 4:00 PM on the 27th. The notes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the US Embassy and the US Embassy's reply to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs are recorded below:</p>
<p>Note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the US Embassy: I am writing regarding Article 2 (d) and Article 9, item (a) of the Agreement between the Republic of China and the United States of America concerning relief assistance from the United States of America to the Chinese people, signed today by representatives of the governments of China and the United States. Both parties understand that the Chinese government has the right to determine the size of its armed forces and the quantity of food and other materials used to supply those forces, and this should be fully recognized. The ratification of the above agreement does not affect this right. However, in accordance with Public Law 84 passed by the 80th Congress authorizing the provision of relief assistance, the President of the United States may terminate the supply of American relief assistance at any time if he believes that an excessive amount of relief materials supplied by the United States to the people of any country, or similar materials produced locally or imported from abroad, are being used to help maintain that country's armed forces. Due to this provision in the relief bill, the US government must reserve the right to terminate the shipment of relief supplies to China if it believes that an excessive amount of relief materials, or similar materials produced locally or imported from abroad, are being used to maintain the armed forces in China. The above is the mutual understanding between our two governments and constitutes part of the aforementioned agreement. I am writing to inform you accordingly and hope you will confirm this. The Acting Minister presents his highest respects to His Excellency John Leighton Stuart, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of China. Liu Shih-shun, October 27, 1947, Republic of China.</p>
<p>Note from the US Embassy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: I am writing in response to your Excellency's note of October 27 of this year, which reads: "(Full text as above, omitted)". Accordingly, I am pleased to confirm that the understanding described in the aforementioned note has now been accepted by the Government of the United States of America and constitutes a part of the agreement signed today. I am writing to inform you accordingly. The Ambassador presents his highest respects to His Excellency Liu, Acting Minister of Political Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. John Leighton Stuart, October 27, 1947.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Arrives in Beijing Via Shanghai - Plans to Immediately Meet with Chairman Chiang to Report on the Trip - Gained a Deep Understanding of the Current Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh returned to the capital on the evening of the 27th. Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, Hang Liwu, Gan Naiguang, Luo Jialun, Liu Shih-shun, Ye Gongchao, Mrs. Wang, and other senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Chinese and foreign reporters, totaling more than 60 people, all went to the airport to welcome him. It was initially rumored that Wang would arrive at 5:30 PM, but after Captain Fu En of the Yi Brigade inquired by telegram to Shanghai, the news was confirmed, so many welcomers made two trips to the airport, and some waited more than three hours. Wang's special China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane, the "Skyhawk 132," landed at 8:05 PM, by which time it was already dusk. The airport lighting equipment shone directly on the aircraft door. Wang, wearing a gray pinstripe suit and a dark coat, stepped out of the cabin, his face full of travel dust, but his expression cheerful. After stepping off the stairs and accepting a group photo from reporters, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers one by one. As he was leaving, he was surrounded by reporters. He initially said, "Slow down." He then described the situation of his trip to Japan, briefly stating: "During his four days in Japan, he had long talks with MacArthur and representatives of the Allied mission in Japan, senior members of our mission in Japan, and Japanese Prime Minister Katayama and Foreign Minister Hida. He personally gained a deep understanding of the current situation in Japan, and believes that some of the reports in the general newspapers regarding the situation in Japan, especially the reports on MacArthur's achievements, do not fully correspond to the facts." As for his discussions with the White House and his overall impressions of the trip, he declined to answer, saying: "Regarding matters in the United States, I do not wish to speak of them briefly." He said that he would talk to reporters in detail as soon as possible, so that this important matter could be made public to the people of the country. Wang said in response to reporters that he planned to immediately meet with the Chairman to report on the trip. Wang left Shanghai for the United States on September 9, leading our delegation to attend the second session of the United Nations General Assembly. During his time in the United States, he engaged in active independent diplomacy. His two proposals regarding the veto power and the Japanese peace treaty have attracted worldwide attention. The former has the potential to resolve disputes caused by the veto power and has been accepted by the General Assembly and referred to a committee for examination. The latter has a decisive impact on the convening and success of the Japanese peace conference and is already reflected in the facts. Both proposals have been strongly supported by people from all walks of life and public opinion in the country, who believe that Wang's trip was a great success.</p>
<h3>A Fifteen-Minute Confidential Talk with Zhang Jia'ao in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Foreign Minister Wang took a Northwest Airlines special plane from Tokyo yesterday at 11:30 AM (Tokyo time) to return to China. Due to wind conditions, he did not arrive at Longhua Airport in this city until 6:15 PM. Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials who returned to China with Foreign Minister Wang included Director Hu Qingyu and Secretary-General Guo Lu. Director Zhang Yuanzhang stayed in the United States due to illness. Many people from all walks of life went to the airport to welcome him, including Hu Shih, Zhang Jia'ao, Shen Zonglian, Chen Guolian, Gao Lingbai, and Zhuang Yuling. Foreign Minister Wang told reporters: "All the questions have been answered in detail in Tokyo. What I can say is that the current Japanese government is indeed working hard to democratize the country. What happens in the future depends on the Japanese peace treaty." Regarding the Allied supervision of Japan after the treaty is concluded, Wang said that it was not convenient to answer. "As for insisting on the veto power in the peace conference, it is our country's established policy. Our country has put forward a plan for this matter and is waiting for the final reply from the United States and the Soviet Union. As for whether there has been any recent change in the US policy towards China, this must be said by the US side itself, and I am not in a position to speak for them. However, the recent reports in American newspapers about China are clearly different from the past." Foreign Minister Wang took the special Skyhawk plane sent by the Chairman to welcome him back to Beijing at 6:35 PM that evening. Before leaving, he had a confidential talk with President Zhang Jia'ao in the center of the airport for as long as fifteen minutes.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yide Flies to Beijing Immediately - Advocates for Aid to China in His Speech in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 27th] US Congressman Zhou Yide's report is becoming an important reference for China policy in Congress. Zhou argues that aid to China is as urgent as aid to Europe, and that aid to China costs less than aid to Europe. Even if the Wedemeyer Report is not published, at least its recommendations should be published so that the American people understand why aid to China is needed. Wedemeyer also advocates for aid to China, but because he spent less time in China, he may not be clear about everything. Some people believe that the Chinese government is "undemocratic," so they oppose aid to China. In fact, no country in a civil war can maintain democracy and eliminate other ills. If we do not aid China now, it may be too late to aid China in the future. If China is unstable, the Korean problem will also be difficult to solve.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Members' Association Writes to the Chairman - Requests the Convening of a Provisional National Assembly - Advocates for Careful Handling of Elections and Efforts to Suppress Disorder</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The National Assembly Members' Association, dissatisfied with the current elections, previously had a proposal to ask the government to convene a provisional National Assembly. Recently, on the morning of the 27th, they presented Chairman Chiang with a letter stating their opinions. At the same time, they hosted reporters at 5:00 PM on the 27th to announce the contents of the letter to the Chairman.

They replied that convening a provisional National Assembly was the government's prerogative. According to the constitution, this request should be made with the joint signature of two-fifths of the representatives. There are now 617 people who have signed their names, asking the government to convene this meeting. Other than that, there are no preparations. Someone then asked if the government disregarded everything and continued to proceed, would the association take further action? They replied that if the authorities disregarded everything, the association would consider further measures, or convene a meeting on its own, but the government should accept this suggestion. Finally, someone shouted that this predetermined list was a rape of public opinion and that everyone should stand up to protect the law.</p>

Chairman Da Paosheng first reported on the results of the recent talks between their nine members and central leaders, stating briefly that the central leaders attached great importance to the election of senators and promised to support them. However, the number of Kuomintang senators who were predetermined to be elected was less than one or two out of ten of the total number, which was quite regrettable. Finally, it was decided that: 1) the Central Committee should continue to support those who have been predetermined by the local association, 2) reasonable and fair remedies should continue to be made for those who have not been supported by the local association, 3) Mo Dehui, Jiang Yong, Zou Wenshan, Da Paosheng, and Shao Lizi were appointed to meet with the Chairman to report on the situation in various places, 4) in addition to the original nine members, additional personnel were assigned to contact them separately.</p>

The situation of this year's industry has improved, but complete recovery will still take time. My inspection did not have a fixed plan, and was entirely determined by the circumstances of time. I plan to visit Jiangxi in the near future, because Jiangxi Province is my hometown, and its mineral resources are also very important." Regarding the U.S.'s changing policy towards China, Peng believes it is natural, because the fundamental interests of China and the United States are consistent, and the two countries should cooperate closely. Taiwan Party Supervisory Commissioner Wu Shao also arrived in Shanghai on the same flight as Peng. He went to Beijing that night to report on his work.</p>

<h3>A New Outlook on the Situation in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the news about Xinjiang seen in the newspapers recently has been quite contradictory. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 22nd, the rebellion in Xinjiang has revived, and Chenghua, 250 miles north of Dihua, has been occupied by the Yining rebels. At the same time, the dispatch from Yining reported that the Yining side is demanding complete independence and is prepared to fight for it by force. At this time, Madam Bao Erhan, a government committee member from Xinjiang, happened to fly from Dihua to the capital, telling reporters that "everything in Xinjiang is peaceful and stable as always, and no chaotic events as rumored have occurred." Coincidentally, General Zhang Zhizhong's open letter of September 1 to Ahmetjan of Yining received a reply at the same time; the Yining side put forward four points as preconditions for negotiations. According to the government committee member Bao Erhan, this reply indicates that the Yining side is willing to reopen the door to negotiations, which is deeply beneficial to the peace of Xinjiang. The situation in Xinjiang is, after all, a matter of concern to the people of the country. Integrating reports from all sides, we believe that although the situation in Xinjiang may not have completely returned to stability, the rebellion may not be as serious as reported by foreign news agencies, and judging from the recent trend, the situation in Xinjiang is also likely to improve.</p>
<p>As Madam Bao Erhan said, the proposal of the Yining side to reply indicates that negotiations can be expected to reopen, which is indeed beneficial to the stability of the situation in Xinjiang. Originally, the situation in Xinjiang had embarked on a new path since General Zhang Zhizhong, following the central government's decision, successively established the main text and appendices of the agreement on reconciliation of the Yining dispute. However, the rebellion suddenly broke out, and the vice chairman of the provincial government, Ahmetjan, established himself in Yining, and Usman, the commissioner of the Ashan district, was expelled from Chenghua. For a time, the situation in Xinjiang, which could have been roughly stabilized, was once again fractured. Now that Usman has recovered Ashan, and the Yining side's reply has been put forward at this time, this is indeed something that makes people ponder.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the Yining Incident in the winter of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], the area formed a semi-independent situation. General Zhang Zhizhong advocated an enlightened and tolerant approach, but failed to change the stubborn attitude of the "splittists." Although a peace agreement was signed in the interim, peace was not guaranteed, and the Tacheng and Ashan regions were eventually invaded by Yining, causing a split in half of Xinjiang's border. The Baitashan Incident on June 5 this year was the Yining side playing the trick of Wu Sangui borrowing troops from the Qi people [Manchu], preparing to ignite flames all over Xinjiang and create greater division and chaos. Looking at the facts of the past few months, the government's handling of the Xinjiang issue has determination and methods, as well as the sincerity of the Uyghur and other ethnic groups to look inward, and the rising anti-separation sentiment of the Xinjiang people. The conspiracy of the "splittists" has failed.</p>
<p>Usman, who recovered the Ashan region, is the leader of the Maoniqa tribe of the Kazakhs and is known as a national hero of the Kazakhs in Xinjiang. After the peace agreement, Wu took office as the commissioner of the Ashan region. Because he was dissatisfied with the activities of the "splittists," he became estranged from Yining. The entire region was occupied by the rebels, and Wu, in a helpless situation, led his troops to withdraw from Baitashan, reorganized his elite troops, and vowed to recover Chenghua and see the light of the integrity of Chinese territory again. Ashan belongs to the Gobi Altai mountain range and borders the Soviet-Mongolian border. Since being captured by the rebels, Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan have stood as a tripod, raising the flag of "East Turkestan." The intention of special status, the outbreak of the Baitashan Incident, is a blatant expression of the development of special status; the departure of Ahmetjan and others from Dihua is an expression of a "separatist" non-cooperative attitude. General Zhang Zhizhong once warned Ahmetjan, hoping that he would return to Dihua to reopen negotiations; Chairman Mesut decided to realize democratic construction and win the hearts of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In the past two months, the enthusiastic popular elections in Xinjiang and the deployment of economic construction have achieved great results. The people of Yining could not bear the autocratic rule and went to Dihua one after another. The people of Ashan were dissatisfied with the exorbitant taxes and levies and asked Usman for help one after another. At this time, Usman recovered Chenghua by unconventional means, and the Ashan area was seen again in the light. If Yining and Tacheng do not consciously return, they will be abandoned by the people and disgusted by the nation.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, we saw the announcement of the Yining side's reply. Regardless of whether they have sincerity in restoring the stability of Xinjiang, since negotiations can be expected to reopen, we hope that the authorities in charge of Xinjiang, such as General Zhang Zhizhong, can return to office as soon as possible and make good deployments and rectifications for our northwestern border defense. China's treatment of Xinjiang is based on the Three Principles of the People of the revolution, with the harmony of all ethnic groups as the premise, which cannot but be said to be our enlightened policy; even foreign newspapers, such as the New York Herald Tribune, also believe that the Chinese government's granting of extensive autonomy to the province and the holding of negotiations by the experienced and capable General Zhang Zhizhong are wise and generous measures. At the same time, we hope that all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, especially the authorities on the Yining side, can also abandon their prejudices, transcend and liberate themselves from the conspiracy of certain countries, and jointly seek a new look for the situation in Xinjiang.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Members' Association Submits Letter to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: In accordance with the procedures for the preparation for the implementation of constitutional government resolved by the National Assembly, a general election must be held this year, and the National Assembly must be convened on December 25 to implement constitutional government. It should be handled as scheduled to uphold the major law. However, the implementation of constitutional government places the greatest emphasis on the general election, which must comply with the Constitution and various regulations on the implementation of constitutional government. The matter should be handled carefully, and efforts should be made to ensure accuracy, to show future generations, and it should not be completed on schedule just because the deadline is approaching, or settle for the facts, make do with what is available, ignore the regulations, and place the foundation of constitutional government on the desert, merely opening up bad precedents for elections and providing excuses for villains. According to written opinions expressed by representatives from Hunan, Guangdong, Shantou and other provinces and cities, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Henan and other provinces also have resolutions to handle the election carefully. Understanding the difficult times, there are many difficulties. Representatives from various places who have come to Beijing one after another have exchanged opinions on this many times. The main points are as follows: The Northeast and North China are now occupied and disturbed by communist bandits, totaling 22 provinces and cities. It is difficult to conduct elections during wartime. The law clearly stipulates that professional representatives are elected nationwide. If these areas adopt methods such as selection and designation due to difficulties, it will not only deprive some voters of their rights, but also invite criticism from all parties. If it is not held temporarily, it will not meet the two-thirds of the required number stipulated in Article 8 of the preparatory procedures. Moreover, the so-called two-thirds means that the whole country is proceeding at the same time. If there are some areas that cannot be elected in time during the election period due to some reason, but more than two-thirds have been elected, the meeting can be held. It does not mean that one-third is not considered. It is necessary to be cautious in advance about the lack of understanding of this kind of legal principle that a meeting can be held by electing only two-thirds, so as to avoid disputes afterwards. The flames of war are everywhere in the northern provinces, and the people are in the midst of displacement and death. The local order in the northern provinces has not yet returned to the pre-war state. This year, floods are rampant, the disaster areas are vast, and the burden of conscription and food requisition is heavy, and the lives of civilians are miserable. At this time, the cost of holding a general election by the central and local governments will amount to hundreds of billions or tens of billions in each province and city. This kind of direct and indirect heavy burden will inevitably affect finance and drag down people's livelihood, which cannot be borne by the society. Suppressing bandits and suppressing rebellion is the primary task of nation-building. At this time of mobilization, all forces should be concentrated to wipe out the communist bandits in one fell swoop, so as to establish the foundation of constitutional government. At this time of panic and potential dangers, if intense competition leads to social disputes and affects the great plan of suppressing rebellion, it will only make relatives sad and enemies happy. The area of the national pacification zone is not small. Although it is stable on the surface, hidden remnants of bandits are active everywhere. If general elections are held in these areas, they will be used by villains. If elections are held in stable provinces and districts first and bandit areas are delayed, it will be difficult to convene a conference and implement constitutional government in the short term. That is, the original intention of the government to return power to the people cannot be realized, and the coexistence of new and old representatives, new and old legislative and supervisory committee members will easily cause regional views and repeat the disputes between the new and old parliaments in the early years of the Republic, hindering the unification of politics. During the mobilization to suppress the rebellion, the soldiers all over the country are running to the front to serve the country. In the midst of this military urgency, they have no time to participate in the election, making it impossible for them to exercise their rights, which is unfair. The number of legislative committee members stipulated by the Legislative Yuan this time is based on the maximum number of households reported by various provinces and cities between the 16th and 25th years of the Republic [1927-1936], and the population numbers in various places after the war have changed greatly. It has not been investigated in detail, and it is intended to produce rough and shoddy products in a few months in a hurry. The procedures cannot be perfect. Not only is it not enough to show seriousness, but it will also arouse accusations from all parties. In a short period of time, it is difficult to be thorough in all aspects of the national election in terms of affairs and technology. It only causes difficulties for governments at all levels. Even if we want to strive for perfection, the actual difficulties cannot be overcome, and it is impossible for a piece of paper from the higher authorities to take effect. Although the date of the National Assembly this year was decided by the previous session of the Assembly, the current situation has changed, which is different from what was expected at the meeting last year that the overall situation could be clarified within six months. Looking at the examples of constitutional government in various countries, constitutional government is started after the foundation of the country is stable. There is no example of promoting elections in order to gloss over peace while internal chaos has not subsided. It is not appropriate to cling to stereotypes and invite criticism. Moreover, disputes have arisen in various places where elections are held, and people's minds are agitated, and dangers are everywhere. The impact of this over time is enough to hinder the implementation of constitutional government and shake the foundation of democracy. Looking to the future, it is very worrying. To sum up, either the number of voters is inaccurate, or it affects the progress of suppressing the rebellion, or it causes social disturbances. If we do not strive for a practical solution, the constitutional government of our country, which has long been stable and peaceful, will become the result of inviting chaos and disturbing the country, hiding the country's shortcomings and betraying the people's expectations. The representatives and others, considering the national conditions and considering the current situation, believe that the preparatory procedures for the implementation of constitutional government were decided by the Constitutional National Assembly, and no organization may change it without a re-resolution by all the representatives. However, judging from the current facts, it is necessary to discuss again and handle the election carefully. After thinking again and again, the representatives and others have no choice but to request your permission to convene a temporary meeting of the National Assembly in accordance with the law, so as to lay the foundation for constitutional government and promote the implementation of democratic politics, which will be deeply beneficial to the future of the country.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Improving Election Affairs</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) The current party nomination and designated voting methods violate the spirit of the Constitution and request that the central government adopt a free competition method. The list of candidates submitted by the provinces and counties should be re-examined by the central government for comparison. Personnel participating in the meeting shall absolutely not run for election. Non-actual practitioners shall not participate in vocational group elections. The Association hosted reporters in Beijing on the 27th. In addition to reporting the above opinions, representatives from various units "such as Jiangxi, Anhui, and others" cited many examples of election scandals in their respective provinces.</p>
<h3>Foreign Military Experts View the Situation in Northeast China; US Aid Is Too Little, Too Late</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Nanjing, 27th) Foreign military observers here almost unanimously agree that the situation of the National Army in Northeast China is difficult to help. According to a foreign observer in a very high position with fifteen years of experience in China, even if US aid becomes a reality, it will have very little immediate impact on the war situation in Northeast China. US aid can boost morale, but it cannot win battles. Even if the United States decides tomorrow to provide financial and military assistance to China, and US industry immediately resumes wartime production, the first batch of bullets will arrive in the guns of the National Army in Northeast China at least six months later. The destruction of transportation in the Northeast is a decisive factor, which is the biggest obstacle facing the National Army in the Northeast. I have seen a section of railway a hundred miles long, destroyed from beginning to end. Government officials admit that there are no more railroad ties left, and there is no possibility of replenishment for many months. On the railways that the government is rushing to repair, the distance between the railroad ties is often more than three yards, thereby reducing its carrying capacity. Now that winter is approaching, construction work will soon come to a complete standstill. As far as the military aid that the United States has given to China so far, it has all been shelved on the islands of the Pacific before being transported to China, allowing it to rot, all due to the lack of new supplies and the abnormal source of supply. Another foreign observer said: Most of the weapons used by the Communist Party are made in Japan, left by the Japanese during the war; as for training, there is no doubt that Soviet personnel are engaged in organization and training. These personnel are first trained in Russia, and then return to the Northeast. The weapons used by the Mongolian Communists and Korean Communists during the war can prove that the previous words are not wrong. Another foreign observer said when referring to the possibility of the United States providing financial and military assistance to China, believing that US assistance is inevitable? The question is whether the Chinese government can accept the terms of the loan. He expects that Foreign Minister Wang will bring these terms with him when he returns from the United States this time. Referring to the sixth offensive launched by the Communist Party in Northeast China, he expects that the Communist Army intends to launch a full-scale offensive before the arrival of winter.</p>
<h3>The Deeds of the People of Jilin and Changchun Fighting Against Bandits Are Laudable and Tragic; The Li Family, the First Household in Karen Northeast, Only Five of More Than Seventy People Survive</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th) Since the bandit atmosphere invaded the Jilin and Changchun areas, many laudable and tragic deeds of the people fighting against bandits have been left on the fertile land south of the Songhua River. With a painful mood, the reporter reports to the people of the country one of the most tragic and heroic facts: On the 17th of this month, after the bandit army infiltrated Karen Station on the Jilin-Changchun Road, another group of about 100 people attacked Xiaozizu Village, six miles northeast of Karen, attempting to steal grain and horses. More than 30 young men from the Li family compound, the first household in the village, resisted the bandits with dilapidated weapons. (According to reports, villages in Northeast China had self-defense weapons before September 18, and shortly after September 18, they also used them to resist the Japanese invaders.) They fought fiercely with the bandits for two hours, killing dozens of bandits. At that time, the bandit reinforcements brought two mortars to support them, and the village was captured. Only five of the Li family compound, consisting of more than 70 men, women, and children, survived, and the rest were brutally killed. More than 20 women and children were tied to trees in the courtyard and stabbed to death with bayonets. The tragic scene is unbearable to hear.</p>
<h3>It Has Snowed in Rehe Province, But Refugee Children Are Still Naked</h3>

Wei will stay in Shanghai for a few days before going to Beijing to report to Chairman Chiang on his inspection.</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Kang Provincial Inspector Suggests Improving Commodity Tax Measures</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th) Zeng Dao, Sichuan-Kang Provincial Inspector, suggested that the Ministry of Finance change the commodity tax adjustment tax rate and tax application methods. The main points are as follows: The number of times and dates of commodity tax rate adjustments each year do not need to be fixed, and should be decided temporarily depending on price changes, so as to avoid merchants pre-reporting taxes. After the merchant fills out the commodity tax tax declaration application, it is necessary to verify the type of goods and pay the tax to issue a certificate. When necessary, personnel can be sent to verify the goods. If it is found that the merchant has pre-reported taxes or is inaccurate, bonuses can be given appropriately to encourage them. Add two columns in the commodity tax tax application form, the person who checks the goods and the person who reviews it, and the person must be stamped after verification, so that the responsibility can be pursued in case of questions.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Sino-American Relief Agreement</h3>

<p>(E) Normally, the funds accruing from the sale of United States relief materials will not be used to reimburse the Government of China for local expenses, including charges for unloading and other port charges, incident to the handling, inland transportation, and distribution of United States relief materials. The United States representatives are willing, however, to consider with the Government of China the use of these funds for meeting extraordinary expenses in order to avoid imposing an undue burden on the Government of China.</p>

<p>(A) The Government of China will exert every possible effort to obtain the greatest possible production and collection of indigenous supplies for relief purposes.</p>
<p>(B) The Government of China undertakes that it will not adopt any measures which will decrease the local supply of any article of the character described in this Agreement or impede the sale or delivery of, or payment for, such article, and thereby increase the relief burden.</p>
<p>(C) The Government of China will keep the United States representatives currently informed regarding plans and measures adopted for the accomplishment of such purposes.</p>
<p>(D) The Government of China recognizes that it has already taken and is taking, to the extent practicable, necessary economic measures to reduce its need for relief and to prepare for its future reconstruction. (Continued on Page 5)</p>

<h3>The Ramadier Cabinet Faces a Critical Moment; The French Provisional Assembly Convenes Today; De Gaulle Declares and Demands Dissolution of the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: Paris News: General De Gaulle today demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Ramadier. When the French National Assembly meets tomorrow, the fate of the French Cabinet will be finally determined.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: Paris News: When the French National Assembly meets tomorrow, Prime Minister Ramadier will do everything in his power to maintain the status of the current cabinet. The French Prime Minister believes that neither left-leaning nor right-leaning is good for the country and the people.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: Paris News: General De Gaulle today advocated dissolving the National Assembly and holding general elections. The Communist Party immediately launched attacks, believing that this was an attempt to establish a "reactionary dictatorship" in France. Communist Party spokesman Pondan declared that De Gaulle's statement aimed to seize personal power and was contrary to the interests of the French people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] After the victory of General De Gaulle's French People's Rally in the municipal elections was further consolidated by the results of the second round of voting on Sunday, he demanded today that the National Assembly be dissolved immediately and that new elections be held. He issued a televised declaration today, demanding an amendment to the constitution. He stated that the Communist Party had lost the support of one-seventh of its voters and that the French People's Rally had received more votes in all districts than the combined votes of other parties. He argued that the municipal elections were the best opportunity to express national public opinion. His declaration stated, "The results of the second round of voting in the municipal districts have shown that out of 500 municipal districts, a total of 2,000 city councilors have been elected, half of whom are candidates from moderate or right-wing parties, while the Communist Party received only 13% of the votes. The French People's Rally has achieved considerable success. As the leader of the alliance, I hereby announce to the whole country that the reconstruction of the country requires the immediate dissolution of the parliament. Without this, I solemnly declare that the promulgation and implementation of the new constitution is essential." In view of De Gaulle's declaration, the French government expects drastic changes soon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] With the cabinet crisis imminent and railway and postal workers threatening strikes, the results of Sunday's municipal elections were fiercely debated today.

<h3>Soviet Proposal to Condemn "War Mongers" Certain to Be Rejected; Australian-Canadian-French Jointly Propose Amendment</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: Lake Success News: Today, in order to ease the deadlock, the Polish representative suddenly proposed an amendment to the "War Mongers" case, arguing that the General Assembly should condemn war mongers, but not list those in the United States, Greece, and Turkey who are suspected of inciting war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 27th] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to formally vote on the Soviet Union's proposal to punish war mongers today, which is the Soviet Union's main proposal at this General Assembly session. It is widely believed that it has no hope of passing and is unlikely to gain support from countries outside the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 27th] Australia, Canada, and France today withdrew their previous resolutions from the Political Committee and put forward a joint resolution condemning all forms of propaganda aimed at inciting, or potentially inciting or encouraging, threats to peace, breaches of peace, or acts of aggression, and calling on member states to use all available means of propaganda to promote friendly relations between countries and encourage anti-war propaganda.

<h3>The Italian Political Situation Gradually Becomes Clear; An Anti-Communist Bloc Forms a Strong Front</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 26th] The actual establishment of the Cominform in Belgrade has clarified the position of the Italian Communist Party and strengthened the anti-communist views of the Italian people. The dividing line between pro-communist and anti-communist parties has become increasingly clear. The Italian Communist Party can now express that "whoever is not with me is against me." The right-wing Socialist Party led by Saragat and the Italian Republican Party, although they had previously voted with the Communist Party against the post-war government, have now been listed as anti-communist. Italy has only one religion, Catholicism, but the number of political parties is as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. In the 1946 Constituent Assembly elections, as many as 36 parties participated in the elections, but to date, many have died young or been absorbed by other parties. Political figures predict that the announcement of the establishment of the Cominform will promote the elimination of small parties and the formation of a strong anti-communist bloc.</p>
<h3>European Recovery Program Needs $20 Billion; US Government Hopes It Will Not Be Cut; Says "International Charity" Is Unlikely to Last</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] It is learned that after President Truman convenes the special session of Congress on November 17, the government believes that the main problems can be summarized into three points: The Marshall Plan will cost the United States $20 billion between 1948 and 1950, and the government believes that this amount cannot be reduced. Another simple "international charity" will have very little and unsustainable results.</p>
<p>Those who implement this plan must have a broad mind to plan where to purchase reconstruction materials, from wheat to steel, and how to distribute them. If Congress believes that US loans must be used to buy American goods, there will be a big dispute. Otherwise, Europe should be strengthened to resist what Truman calls "collective pressure" and to strengthen US national defense.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] A Moscow Radio commentator said: The implementation of the Marshall Plan will place countries with coal and metals under the direct monopoly of German economic power. The Soviet Union will use all its strength to prevent the Marshall Plan from being implemented.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: Lake Success News: Indian Representative Pillai today strongly urged the Security Council to take active action to resolve the Indonesian-Dutch dispute and accused the Dutch government of disregarding the Security Council's ceasefire order.

<p>Report Provided by Our Military Observation Group</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Singapore, 27th] According to the report submitted to the Nanjing government by the Chinese military observation group of the six-nation consular investigation team on the Indonesian ceasefire, thousands of overseas Chinese were brutally killed by Indonesian radical elements during the Indonesian war, and there are currently more than 30,000 overseas Chinese refugees displaced, with about 500 people unaccounted for. Property losses are incalculable. Although the Indonesian government has repeatedly stated that it will fully protect them, it has not been effective. Half of the anti-Chinese sentiment in Indonesia is due to Japanese instigation and half is due to Dutch tactics.</p>

When a reporter asked if he was worried about being driven out by force, General Clay laughed and said: "I do not believe that force will be used to drive us out of Berlin at this time. We will not shy away from possible obstacles and difficulties and will remain here." In a general review of Germany and related issues, Clay stated: "Next year will be a year of decisions, and the next six months are extremely important. If we can help with the recovery of Europe, the situation will definitely ease by June or July next year." Clay hopes that the London conference on November 25th will be able to reach concrete decisions regarding the German issue; he forcefully stated: "The time when we could solve this problem has passed." He frankly declared: "What we are doing is merely maintaining the status quo. Any aid to Europe is an investment in the survival of the American way of life.

<h3>Searching and Sealing are Not Fundamental Policies to Suppress Prices; Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Municipal Government to Protect Legitimate Business Operations and Exercise Prudent Inspections to Stabilize All Industries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, regarding the quantity of newspapers stored by the paper industry, which is only 30% of the pre-war level and does not constitute hoarding, petitions the Municipal Government to handle the matter fairly and protect legitimate business operations. The petition states: "In recent years, whenever prices fluctuate, various parties always believe that the reason for this is that there are hoarded goods not being sold. The authorities, under the pressure of public opinion, invariably resort to searching and sealing as the only countermeasure to suppress prices. In reality, rising prices have various political and economic causes, and their composition is complex and difficult to handle. However, searching for hoarding can be accomplished with a single official document and a dozen police officers. Once the matter is announced, it can slightly appease the demands of public opinion. Therefore, without investigating the truth or the definition of hoarding, any business with a slightly larger scale and more inventory is always the first to be hit. The Chamber believes that all businesses, whether wholesale or retail, except for vendors who sell and replenish their goods daily, must purchase a batch of goods and sell them in installments. As for the quantity of goods purchased and stored, it varies depending on the amount of capital and the volume of sales. There is no fixed quantity, and the law does not specify any. In recent years, domestic and foreign transportation has not been as convenient as it was before the war, and batches of goods ordered cannot arrive on schedule. Imported goods also have different quotas, and there are gradual reductions. Therefore, leaving some leeway to avoid shortages and panic when the supply is running low is actually beneficial and harmless from the perspective of people's livelihood. The financial strength of merchants after the war is far weaker than it was before the war. Considering the inventory in their hands, on the whole, it must be far less than it was before the war. However, although there was a lot of inventory before the war, it did not violate any prohibitions. Now, people are easily blamed. Is it really that the laws are different now than they were in the past? It is nothing more than that the relationship between prices makes it easy to become the target of public criticism.</p>
<p>The Chamber believes that this relationship is not limited to the paper industry. It is natural that businesses must have inventory. If businesses are ordered to sell all their goods immediately after purchasing them, regardless of the quantity, it would only allow those with financial strength to buy everything up, without helping to stabilize the livelihoods of the common people. The Chamber believes that at this time of economic hardship, if we want to seek relief, we must identify the source of the illness, just like a doctor treating a patient. If the diagnosis is not accurate and medicines are administered indiscriminately, the harm will precede the benefit. Searching and sealing are definitely not the fundamental policy to suppress prices. Moreover, considering that the current inventory of newspapers in the industry is only 30% of the pre-war level, in all fairness, it cannot be said that they are hoarding. Otherwise, if this precedent is set, all industries must not have any overnight inventory to be considered legitimate business operations. Then, where will the sold-out goods be replenished? This is a very obvious matter. The Municipal Government's understanding of the difficulties of businesses must be appreciated. Therefore, this special petition is submitted, hoping that the Municipal Government will review it, handle it fairly, and quickly order the police station to unseal the inventory, return the account books, protect legitimate business operations, and implement inspections cautiously so that all industries can be stabilized and the market will not be disturbed. Would that not be the fortune of that industry alone?"</p>

According to Chen's confession, a part of the paper belongs to Li Kunquan, the manager of the Jiukang Paper Company in this city, and most of it is stored by Li Kunlin, the manager of the Dakang Paper Company.

<h3>Cotton Textile Workers' Ten Demands; Capitalists Agree in Principle</h3>
<p>(This newspaper news) The industrial workers of the cotton textile industry in this city submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting the capitalists to improve ten welfare facilities: Payment of wages for power outage days. Maternity allowance for female workers. Job security, workers shall not be dismissed without reason. Welfare funds and schools for children of workers. Convening factory meetings.

The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a discussion meeting between labor and capital on the 30th of this month to discuss the implementation details of each welfare measure.</p>
<h3>There is No Difference in the Use of Radio Frequencies; Yu Bingjian's Statement</h3>
<p>Yu Bingjian, representing the Telecommunications Bureau, issued a statement yesterday regarding the joint appeal by eight privately-owned radio stations in this city, including Huozhong Bi, to the City Council for the fair use of frequencies. The statement elaborated on the frequency allocation process for radio stations in this city, stating that as of the present time, a total of 21 radio stations have been approved, with two stations sharing one frequency. According to the regulations issued by the Ministry, there are a total of twelve frequencies. Except for the eleven frequencies that should be issued to the 21 approved radio stations, there is only one frequency of 1000 K.C. that remains unused. Among the 21 approved stations, the Xin Yun, Wen Xie, and Da Mei stations were approved only in August and September of this year. Therefore, the Xin Yun station, which was the 19th station to be approved, was given 880KC and broadcasts every other day, sharing it with the Wen Xie station, which was the 20th station to be approved. The Da Mei station, which was the 21st station to be approved, was given 760K.C. and also broadcasts every other day. It is only that the Wen Xie station declared to the bureau that it needed to delay its broadcast for a few days due to equipment arrangement, so the industry mistakenly believed that Da Mei and Xin Yun had been approved to use a single frequency exclusively. In fact, these two stations should still broadcast every other day, just like the other eighteen radio stations, with two stations sharing one frequency, with no difference.</p>
<h3>Zhu Boquan Makes Seven Points in Response to Retrial</h3>

<h3>Major Corruption Case Involving Ribbed Steel; Cha Liang Suspected of Being Arrested and Sent to the District Procuratorate, Released on Bail</h3>
<p>(This newspaper news) Cha Liangchou, the team leader of the Pinghan Railway Shanghai Office, Luoming section, who was suspected of being involved in a major corruption case involving more than one billion yuan of ribbed steel in the Pinghan Railway Shanghai Office, was arrested by the police departments of the two railway bureaus. He was transferred to the District Procuratorate the day before yesterday. Because it was a Sunday, the duty prosecutor briefly questioned him and temporarily remanded him in custody. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Lu Zhennan questioned Cha and informed him that he was released on bail pending further investigation of the evidence of Cha's corruption. It is reported that Cha is accused of taking advantage of his position this spring to exchange more than 7,000 jin of ribbed steel bars, worth more than one billion yuan, used to repair the Pinghan Railway for four motors with a merchant, with a value of over one hundred million yuan. The matter was detected by the 7th Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Command, which conducted a secret investigation and reported the situation to its superiors.

<h3>Chen Boquan Issues Statement on Railway Bureau's Rice Purchase Incident</h3>
<p>(This newspaper news) The rice purchase incident by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration in Nanjing at the time attracted considerable attention from all walks of life in Shanghai and Nanjing. After Director Chen Boquan of the bureau reported the detailed process to the Ministry of Transportation, the matter was put to rest. However, recently, there have been many criticisms of the case from the outside world. Chen issued a special statement yesterday, stating: "On the 16th of this month, I accompanied Deputy Director Hou or Hua to Nanjing to inspect the construction of the new Xiaguan Railway Station. When planning the third-class passenger waiting room, Guo Shaohou, the chairman of the Nanjing Transportation Industry Association, and Director Ren Bendao and two others came to strongly urge me to inspect Meitan Port. We originally wanted to go, so we told them to go ahead. When we arrived at Meitan Port, we saw that the grain was piled up on the riverbank, outside the cargo space, with more than 6,000 tons. Originally, cars could only be dispatched after the goods arrived at the cargo space, but I felt that these were the blood and sweat of the farmers, the wealth of the country, and could not be left to be exposed to the wind and rain, so I ordered the transportation department to dispatch cars immediately to transport them out in response to Director Guo's request. But at the same time, I also asked Director Guo to agree to two things: Although it is currently the autumn harvest season and grain is congested, before I have transported the grain on the shore, please do not unload ships for the time being, otherwise the limited military skins cannot cope with the endless source. Our employees are very poor, please help, ask the grain merchants to buy some cheap grain for our employees to eat, and explain that Nanjing General Station Chief Zhang Wenhuan and five senior officials and supervisors of the Railway Bureau in Nanjing, including Lu Bureau and the supervisors in Nanjing, are responsible for the negotiation between the Railway Bureau and Guo. Director Guo was very generous and readily agreed. That night I returned to Shanghai. Two days later, Mayor Wu of Shanghai called and said that the price of grain in Shanghai was soaring, please help the municipal government to quickly transport the grain waiting for shipment on the riverbank to Shanghai. So, within five days, a total of 7,280 tons were transported to Shanghai. At the same time, I called Zhang Wenhuan, the General Station Chief in Nanjing, Fan Ti伤, the chief of the locomotive section, Zhang Jinshan, the director of the locomotive depot, Ye Zuo　, the chief of the engineering section, and Zhang Qifa, the general supervisor, to solicit the opinions of all the employees of the Nanjing station on how many shi of rice they needed, and showed everyone the samples of rice and agreed on the price. After consultation, it was decided to have 2,600 shi, in order to make the numbers uniform. Later, it was decided to be 3,000 shi. On the one hand, General Station Chief Zhang proceeded to purchase it, on the other hand, the internal accounting office was afraid that Mo Jie福 would consult with Auditor Deng because, according to auditing regulations, large-scale purchases must be done by bidding, but Auditor Guo knew that it was for the welfare of the employees, it could not be delayed, and it was purchased at a low price, so he immediately agreed to pay and handed the payment voucher to Zhang, Fan, and Ye for joint safekeeping so that they could pay as they purchased. General Station Chief Zhang agreed on the price of 460,000 yuan per dan and purchased 500 shi. The Nanjing Xinmin Evening News issued incorrect news, changing 500 shi to 500 tons, and pointing the facts of purchasing rice for the employees to hoarding, connecting several days There are several newspapers published　　news, actually intentional slander, stories of slander. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications　has long called to instruct us to continue to purchase rice for the welfare of the employees. In addition to following the instructions, we have also strictly investigated the manufacturers in preparation for pursuing the decision."</p>

Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, told reporters yesterday: "The generator of the United Electric Power Company was originally intended to purchase the machines compensated by Japan to our government. Now, because the United States has suggested that the Japanese power equipment should be the final allocated compensation material, and whether the compensated machine is suitable is still a problem, the two 50,000 kilowatt generators of the United Company may be purchased from abroad." Director Zhao also said: "He is studying whether the arbitration of the contract has a sovereign issue. This issue is not simple, it may be a legal issue, a technical issue, or a valuation issue, so arbitration is necessary. The arbitrator must be impartial, so we have asked the president of the International Court of Justice to introduce a person to act as an arbitrator in a private capacity, which will not harm sovereignty. As for the contract, it is because there is a foreign loan relationship, so foreigners want to use the contract as a guarantee."</p>

<h3>Eighty-Year-Old Grandfather Cradles Infant, Frail Brother Dies from Illness Due to Drought, Father Served as Puppet Official and Property Confiscated, Knowledgeable Young Girl Mingles in Brothels, Luo Junbi Covers Her Face and Sobingly Narrates Her Tragic Life Experience</h3>
<p>(Our report) On the evening of the 25th of this month, the Songshan Road Police Precinct arrested a private prostitute in the Great World. The next day, she was taken to the General Bureau's Moral Guidance Section. Because of her gentle demeanor, unlike a common prostitute, the section chief, Bao Tianyi, personally interrogated her. The woman initially refused to tell the truth, but after repeated gentle inquiries, the woman began to wail, revealing a tragic life experience, which was extremely sad.</p>
<p>The woman is a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, 23 years old, named Luo Junbi, and lives at No. 9 Yinxiang Road, Jiangwan. Her father served as the director of the Finance Bureau and the director of the Opium Prohibition Bureau in Wuhan during the fall of Chongqing. After the victory, he was sentenced to seven years for treason, and all of his property was confiscated. Luo also has an eighty-year-old grandfather and a frail brother named Luo Ming, who has contracted tertiary tuberculosis, and whose spouse died early, leaving behind a three-year-old child. After this drastic change, the lives of the four generations were completely dependent on others, so they wandered from place to place, came to Shanghai by roundabout routes, and tried every means to work as a telegraph operator at the Ministry of National Defense's radio station, using meager income to support the family. Unexpectedly, she was recently ordered to be transferred to . At that time, Luo's grandfather was bedridden, and it was difficult for the elderly, the weak, and the infant to follow her north. After thinking it over and over again, she resigned with great pain. Although she was in Shanghai, she still had many mouths to feed, so she jumped into the fire pit and secretly worked as a prostitute, hoping to support the whole family and pay for medical expenses with her body. Unexpectedly, fate was fickle, and she was arrested after only a month.</p>
<p>After Miss Luo was arrested, her brother, Luo Ming, forcibly supported his illness and wrote to the police局: "My sister was originally a knowledgeable woman. Why did she go astray? It was really forced by social circumstances. Since my sister was arrested," my grandfather was so worried that he could not get up and passed away. There was nothing to bury him.承普山莊施棺成禮, and I扶病得一家庭教席, I know that I cannot bear the troubles and I will not be able to support myself. I hope that the authorities will give me the last chance to repent and give me sympathy so that my family can be reunited."</p>
<p>After receiving this letter, the police Moral Guidance Section was deeply moved. Because Miss Luo was not comparable to ordinary prostitutes, it specially presented a request for leniency and release, and hoped that people from the community would provide sympathy and effective assistance so that this weak woman would not repeat her past actions.</p>

<h3>Five "Mihun" (Bewilderment), Four "Kill" (Extermination), Three "Reward" (Inducement): A Communist Cadre's Candid Confession</h3>
<p>[Jinan, 22nd (Air Mail)] Recently, Yue Xiuwang, a Communist cadre who once served as the head of the Culture and Education Section of the Communist Bandit Shandong Provincial Government's Fenxi Administrative Office, because of a so-called "re-examination" recently held in the bandit area: "thoroughly investigate and purge cadres, eliminate cadres from landlord backgrounds, eliminate unstable elements, and rectify the Communist Party's ranks," as a result, not only was Yue Xiuwang's ancestral property in his hometown of Shouzhang Tongzhuang fought to the point of complete destitution, but his father was also suppressed, causing his entire family of more than ten people to fall into a state of being without clothing or food, begging for a living. Furthermore, Yue Xiuwang himself, who had "revolved for six years," was also deemed to have "wavering thoughts" and was about to be arrested and killed. Yue, in light of the Communist bandits' past repeated emphasis on "struggle being reasonable and legal, and family members must be taken care of," had already become a mere formality. Now, even the families of veteran revolutionary cadres are being struggled against. Rather than waiting to be arrested and killed, it would be better to "come to Jinan and surrender," "frankly confess personal sins, and await the punishment of national law," which would be more beneficial to the country and to oneself. When Yue Xiuwang surrendered to the Pacification District here, he "frankly" revealed everything about the internal facilities of the "Liberated Area." However, the reporter believes that the following is particularly worthy of attention and should be exposed: the "Mihuntang" (bewildering potion), also known as the "youth control technique," used by the Eighth Route Army on young people, is as follows:</p>
<p>Five "Mihun" (Bewilderment): Officiousness – "Joining the Eighth Route Army will lead to high office," to lure young people who covet fame and fortune. Greed – "Serving in the Eighth Route Army means money to spend." In the past, there was "virtual cloth," but today there are "Anti-Japanese currency" or "North Sea banknotes." Lust – "Serving in the Eighth Route Army means beautiful wives." The Eighth Route Army specially trains a large number of women to "use their bodies as a sacrifice for the revolution" to bewilder young people. Land – "The tillers own their land," "The poor turn over a new leaf," luring the poor into a trap. Books – Reprinting Marxist-Leninist books to contaminate pure young people.</p>
<p>Four "Kill" (Extermination): Landlord Kill – "Landlords are evil," kill without pardon. Those who sympathize with landlords are "unstable in their stance" and must also be killed. Corruption Kill – Communist cadres who are corrupt must be killed. Betrayal Kill – "Compromise means surrender," "Not revolutionary means enemy," "Wavering means betrayal," kill without pardon. Spy Kill – Right-leaning means "Nationalist spy," left-leaning means "Trotskyist," kill without pardon.</p>
<p>Three "Reward" (Inducement): Honorary Reward – Printed certificates of merit, divided into first-class heroes, second-class heroes, and third-class heroes, determined by cadres' meetings. Material Reward – Items such as towels, soap, toothbrushes, and books. Promotion – Based on performance, determine promotion qualifications. According to Mr. Yue, these five "Mihun," four "Kill," and three "Reward" are, in fact, nothing more than deception, intimidation, brutality, and bribery. Young people in the rear who do not understand the actual internal situation of the bandit area are lured by Marxist-Leninist books and, like martyrs in the Middle Ages, travel long distances and brave countless mountains and rivers to the "Liberated Area."</p>
<p>Conclusion: In their imagination, they initially believed that the "Liberated Area" was "heaven." Who knew that after being tricked into entering the "Liberated Area," they would be innocently sent to "heaven" under groundless charges such as "compromise," "not revolutionary," "wavering," or even "Nationalist spy" and "Trotskyist"? Who knew how many young people, and even cadres with a long history and merit in the Communist Party, would be tied to the cross and truly sent to "heaven" in this "re-examination"? Yue Xiuwang concluded his "frank confession" about the internal affairs of the "Liberated Area" by saying: "The path taken by the Chinese Communist Party is one of "communism," "common poverty," and "common death," truly leading to the destruction of the entire nation and state by death."

<h3>Communist Bandit Rampages in Changzhou Rural Areas</h3>
<p>[Wujin, 26th] After the Double Ninth Festival, the Changzhou countryside is in the midst of harvesting rice and the autumn harvest season. In order to sabotage our collection of field taxes and disrupt local public security, the bandit army has launched its "grain grabbing movement" and has also carried out brutal massacres in the countryside, especially in the seventh and eighth districts. After the entire Nanjing militia detachment in the seventh district was disarmed and killed by the bandits, their momentum became even more rampant.

<h3>Shen Bao and Ten Major Hospitals Jointly Organize Free Tuberculosis X-Ray Examination Statistics Table: 16.3% of Those Suffering from Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>The free tuberculosis X-ray lung fluoroscopy jointly organized by this newspaper and ten major hospitals was held in two phases this year, and ended at the end of June. The number of applicants exceeded 10,000, and quite a few people did not go for examination after specifying the date and hospital for various reasons. The actual number of people examined was 9,573. The Lung Disease Center Clinic was entrusted to analyze the statistics, and 16.3% of them had active pulmonary tuberculosis. The high percentage is truly unexpected. The reason is that a small number of applicants already knew that they had suspected tuberculosis and wanted to use the examination to determine it, so the percentage of tuberculosis increased. The analysis and statistics are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Degree of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>(B) Gender Classification (C) Age Classification</p>
<p>(D) Occupational Classification</p>
<p>Looking at the above statistics, the 20-30 year old stage is the most infected with tuberculosis, and the crisis is less after 40 years old. The examination results showed that 93 people suffered from heart disease and other diseases, accounting for 1%. 7,920 people had normal cardiopulmonary function, accounting for 82.7%.</p>

<h3>Contemplation</h3>
<p>— F.M.P.</p>
<p>Excessive tension in emotional life is often harmful to body and mind. If we want to enjoy a real, deep, and peaceful perfect life, we must use an art of balancing emotions - contemplation.</p>
<p>Contemplation brings a pleasant and peaceful state of mind, just like a person who listens to beautiful music, views the pleasant sunset, or rests on the verdant high mountains, and encounters a state of mind unintentionally. It is an attitude of surprise without being hasty, consideration without being demanding. Nirvana, as the Buddhists call it, Ataraxia, as Epicurus called it, "No worries" (Apathesia), as the Stoics called it, and Sitting in Oblivion, as Zhuangzi called it, are originally realms in life that can be hoped for but not reached. But in contemplation, we can vaguely approach them. "Wandering in the realm of emptiness and stillness, standing alone beyond all things," is not this a portrayal of contemplation? The disappearance of all thoughts, the extinction of self-view, is not this the deep interest of contemplation? Spinoza once said: "When the mind knows things in an eternal state, it also participates in eternity"! The feeling of eternity is the supreme experience of the soul. Zhuangzi's so-called "Heaven and earth and I were born together, and all things and I are one"; Sun Chuo's line in his "Ode to Tiantai Mountain," "Mixing all phenomena for a dark view, being unified with nature," is just the wonderful use of contemplation, allowing the soul to float and sink in the eternal and vast space.</p>
<p>Treating contemplation as an art of life can not only give us rest, but also give us new life. Focused and in-depth contemplation is the arming of the soul, preparing for future work, nourishing energy, and making mental strength strong and vitality overflowing. For all things, in the chemical liquid of contemplation, we can breed new values and sharp perspectives. Confused memories are cleansed, and rough ideas are polished. The inner intellect can also thrive and grow in the fertile soil of contemplation!</p>
<p>However, contemplation does not mean isolating oneself from others, detaching oneself from the world, breaking away from cruel reality, and parting ways with genuine experience. On the contrary, it is a further deepening of reality, a further grasping of experience - seeing through the appearance of things to their essence, and seeing their organic connections in the chaotic status quo. It allows us to pan out the golden grains of truth in the mud and sand of ordinary life; to pick the honey juice of interest in the diverse wonders of life; and to hold steady the rudder of action in the turbulent waves of the human sea. The pragmatist philosopher William James once said: "Going to a quiet place often can induce insightful thinking and always maintain the correct point of view. A period of contemplation is like a person who is squeezed in the human sea and cannot find a way out, climbing to the South Gate to overlook the trend of the entire crowd, and then coming down to walk in the correct direction." This is the practical value of contemplation in life.</p>
<p>Literature, art, science, and philosophy are all created from contemplation and completed in contemplation. Liu Xie's "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" has the saying: "The mind of writing, its spirit is lost. Therefore, in silent contemplation, the mind connects to thousands of years, quietly moved, the sight penetrates thousands of miles? Between chanting, the sound of pearls and jade is uttered; before the ..., the color of wind and clouds is unfolded. Is its thinking profound? Therefore, thinking is wonderful, traveling with things." The little bird of imagination, spreading its wings, in the clear sky of contemplation, takes such a transcendent, colorful journey. And ultimately expressed as a brilliant work of art. Whether it is a novel or a poem, it must be cultivated through contemplation before it can bloom into a brilliant flower of art! The great Soviet novelist M. Sholokhov (author of "And Quiet Flows the Don") loved contemplation the most. Once he went fishing, and after casting his hook, he suddenly stared at the surface of the water, as still as a wooden chicken. He was so immersed in thought that he did not move for more than an hour, and then he hurried home and wrote all night long. This shows the need for novelists to think deeply. Poetry, some people may think, is about enthusiasm and does not value deep thought. But the great English poet Wordsworth once defined poetry as "emotion recollected in tranquility." Milton, the author of the magnificent poem "Paradise Lost," also completed his poem in contemplation. After graduating from Cambridge University, he lived in his father's manor for five years. His first few famous poems were the crystallization of his wandering in the fields, wandering his eyes and mind, letting his imagination fly, and letting his thoughts dance wildly. One of them, a poem titled Contemplation (Il Perserso), expresses the wonderful interest of contemplation and deeply understands its essence. Later, he became blind, and his great poems were all filtered through his mind's contemplation and dictated to his daughter for recording.</p>
<p>Nietzsche, in "The Birth of Tragedy," said that the artistic realm is composed of two spirits: one is dream (symbolized by the sun god Apollo), and the other is intoxication (symbolized by the wine god Dionysus). The former is an endless image, and all plastic arts and sculpture belong to it; the latter is incomparable heroism, and all dynamic and rigid arts belong to it, such as dancing and music. Nietzsche believed that these two spirits were combined in one furnace - the deep inner pain and the vivid image - and thus produced Greek tragedy. What Nietzsche called the art of dream is precisely the art of contemplation. In the vast dreamland, the mind displays a colorful, clear, magnificent image, which constitutes a profound and broad art; it displays a beautiful, elegant, gentle, and graceful image, which constitutes an art like a secluded forest, like pearls and jade. Deep thought is the best dreamland for expressing art and creating art. In fact, there is also a realm of contemplation in the art of intoxication. In music, such as Beethoven's Third and Fifth Symphonies, it is indeed like "lightning and thunder, hills and mountains shaking," making people "soul tremble and spirit move, startled and awake all night"; but his Sixth Symphony is "happy, thoughtful, sad, and sorrowful," extremely gentle and subtle, precisely a dreamlike realm of contemplation like "a day of brocade clouds, ten thousand stars rushing."</p>
<p>Great painters who create images cannot help but indulge in contemplation. In contemplation, they can fully observe, fully perceive, and fully imagine. Su Dongpo said that when painting bamboo, one should have bamboo in one's chest. That is to say, one must have an image in one's contemplation that is "full of vitality, smooth blood, itching and breathing, and responsive to touch," and then pick up a brush and paper and complete it in one stroke. Huang Zijiu, a great painter of the Yuan Dynasty, spent all day sitting in desolate mountains and rocks, in deep forests, with a trance-like expression, and people could not guess what he was writing. He also often went to the sea where the tides flowed through, where the rapids roared and surged; even if the wind and rain were sudden, the water monsters would not care. He embodied and chanted nature in contemplation, and integrated images, so his paintings were deep and changed, creating the same magic as nature. Zong Bing of the Six Dynasties said in his "Preface to Painting": "All interests are integrated into the divine thought." The divine thought that is uniquely connected to the ingenious mind is like a wonderful melting furnace, which tempers and changes the myriad phenomena of the universe, and transforms them into the wonderful scenery of a goddess scattering flowers. Similarly, in the West, contemplation is also the key to art. Michelangelo once said: "The painter does not use his hands but his brain." Leonardo da Vinci also wrote: "The mind of genius is most likely to create when it is least doing external work"! Therefore, when he created his masterpiece "The Last Supper," he sat in front of the blank canvas, dazed and motionless for several days. This greatly annoyed the abbot of the temple who ordered him to paint, and he asked endlessly: "When are you going to work"? In order to retaliate against this incessant annoyance, he unconsciously modeled Judas's image after this nobleman. The essence of beautiful activity lies in the artist's conceiving a complete image in such quiet consideration that can express the main purpose in his heart.</p>
<p>The need for science and philosophy to contemplate is self-evident. Newton's discovery of the law of universal gravitation was caused by seeing an apple fall, which led to contemplation; Watt's invention of the steam engine was caused by seeing steam boiling in a pot, which led to conception; Freud's theory of the subconscious was also the harvest of watching algae and contemplating in the heart; the great modern scientist Einstein was also constantly contemplating and thinking silently. Before he became famous, he worked as a patent examiner in the Swiss Federal Patent Office. Although he was not allowed to do private work during office hours, he often fell into extreme deep thought! Edison - this unprecedented great inventor - was also often contemplating! Once, he was in line to receive something, because he was contemplating a problem. When it was his turn and he was asked his name, he was stunned and did not know what to say! It can be imagined how deep his contemplation was that he even forgot his own name. Kant, the great philosopher who carried on the past and opened up the future, never left his birthplace of Königsberg in his life. He devoted himself to contemplation in a life of regularity for fifteen years before completing his masterpiece "Critique of Pure Reason"... There are too many examples of scientists and philosophers contemplating, and we need not give many more. In fact, without contemplation, science and philosophy can never have discovery and invention. The migration of the universe's phenomena, the unpredictable changes of life, the complexity and randomness of society - without returning to the source, without detailed and comprehensive thinking, how can we analyze them, peek into their secrets, and see their depth and breadth? And then condense them into solutions, develop them into theories, and respond to all things without error?</p>
<p>Contemplation is an art that is different from daydreaming. Contemplation is the pursuit of objective truth, goodness, and beauty while temporarily forgetting the clinging little self. It has a bright light and no entangled emotions. It is "all things are quietly observed and are naturally obtained," and it has the aura of Cheng Zi's so-called "Phoenix flying in the sky," with the atmosphere of "the moon is in the center of the sky, the wind comes to the surface of the water," and "pearls nourish themselves, and jade conceives cicadas in the mountains." At the same time, the summary of experience also flashes a light that illuminates action - as Leigh Hunt said: "The world is a comedy to those who think, a tragedy to those who feel." Let us recognize this comedic world in contemplation!</p>
<h3>Sinclair Continues to Write His Great Work</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Sinclair is already sixty-eight years old this year. He said, "I have been trying to change the world." The first goal was the alcohol business his father was running when he was studying at a school in New York. At the age of fourteen, he entered the City College of New York and made a living by writing. At the age of twenty-one, he married and was very poor. From 1901 to 1906, he wrote five novels. "Love's Pilgrimage" is a fable he wrote, which has his own views on gender issues. He is famous for his masterpiece "The Jungle." He has published more than sixty books, and now he has published eight adventure stories of Lanny Budd. The third book, "Dragon's Teeth," won the Pulitzer Prize in 1943. His most recent eighth book is called "Presidential Mission." He types in the rose garden of Monrovia in the morning, typing one thousand to fifteen hundred words in three hours. In the afternoon, he revises the manuscript. In the evening, when he takes a walk, he thinks about the later chapters. He said, "Now I am thinking about the material for the ninth book." He is finishing a book called "A Giant's Strength," which is a drama about the future of the atomic bomb. He said, "I believe that socialized industry developing along the TVA line is completely in line with free and democratic organizations. Along this line, I hope to see social problems solved." His body is neither tall nor short, meeting the average height. His eyes are gray-blue, and his hair is gray. His voice is very gentle. Charlie Chaplin likes to imitate him because he "always smiles when he speaks."</p>
<p>Sinclair is a genius. If he weren't a genius, people wouldn't pay attention to him. One of him can be worth ten ordinary writers. His Lanny Budd series of novels naturally have his readers, and selling 100,000 copies is the minimum. This latest one has sold 750,000 copies. The protagonist, Lanning Prescoff Budd, is the heir to a large industry, and he does a lot of business, with marketing offices in Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin. He becomes friends with Roosevelt. The president wants someone to do a particularly dangerous job, and he finds Lanny. Lanny goes to the Nazis, gets many military secrets, and also makes a good deal. Characters in the book also include Churchill, Hess, Eisenhower, etc. The scenes change very quickly, from Hyde Park to Downing Street.</p>
<p>The author's writing of both fictional characters and real historical figures in the novel can be said to be a bold attempt.</p>
<p>But the "Lanny Budd Novels" also have their failures. The author does not have the mysterious power to make his novels believable. This may be due to Sinclair's lack of creativity, or it may be because he writes too quickly. Sinclair is a genius, but unfortunately, he does not have the time to properly train his talents. He wants to write a book every year, so he often seems not profound. This is the difference between Dumas and Stendhal. Fortunately, Sinclair does not focus on art, and he pays more attention to content than to form.</p>
<h3>Conditions for Writing Poetry</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Mengwu</p>
<p>The Soviet writer Mayakovsky, in his article "How I Write," talked about the four necessary conditions for us to write poetry, which can indeed be used as a reference for general poets, so I have copied them as follows:</p>
<p>The existence of a social task that can only be achieved by poetry. Therefore, poetry must have a social "mission." Here is an interesting thing that is often overlooked and worth studying: that is, there is not much connection between the social mission that the poet undertakes and the mission that is actually given.</p>
<p>For the society you represent, you must have correct knowledge, or at least a passionate feeling; in other words, you must have a firm attitude and a clear goal.</p>
<p>You must have materials, a vocabulary storage room. The storage room in your heart should store the words you need - all kinds of clear, rare, fresh, concise, and original words.</p>
<p>Poets must develop the habit of polishing words and sentences. This habit is entirely personal and can only be developed through years of continuous work. It includes prose, rhythm, rhyme, imagery, arrangement, style, plot, poetry tail, title, layout, etc.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Isn't that right! Such a young age, overnight..."</p>
<p>"What?... Young age"? When Baisaifu heard me interject and ask, a sinister smile appeared on his face, but the smile disappeared immediately, as if he didn't want me to see it. He continued:</p>
<p>"I just heard people say it. I heard that this murderous 'fairy' is very young, so young that people dare not believe it, only fifteen or sixteen years old; do you think it's possible? What I mean is that such a young child, only fifteen or sixteen years old, has an incredible special ability to kill people with his bare hands. I heard that everyone he killed had the same wound, this action seems to be leaving a secret message for his accomplices - that is to say, the 'identity' of the wound is a code, and when it is published in the newspaper, everyone will spread the message, and his accomplices - two partners - will be able to understand that it is his work, and they can track down his location." - Baisaifu analyzed it this way.</p>
<p>"This is really a bit mysterious and incredible"! I always maintained a consistent attitude - pretending to be stunned: "Has anyone really seen clearly that he is just a fifteen or sixteen-year-old child"? I'm only twelve or thirteen years old, I'm afraid he's also changed, so I asked this question to find out clearly.</p>
<p>"It's hard to say, but some Japanese do admit that the 'fairy' they saw was of an 'uncertain' age; that means that he seems young, but also seems very old". Baisaifu also seemed a bit恍惚</p>
<p>Using two different tones, she and Baisaifu said this dialogue with expressions, and just asked Little Tiger: "Tiger, did you really kill seven or eight of them?" Before this sentence was finished, a series of footsteps came from outside the door. We all knew it was Wu Dingyuan coming back, so we unconsciously cut off what we were going to say.</p>
<p>Because Dingyuan had not recovered his health, he walked as if his legs were tied with lead bars, dragging one step after another. But as soon as he entered the door, we all noticed the very nervous look on his face.</p>
<p>"The news is not good!" Dingyuan took off the incongruous monk's robe and pulled off some trivial and mysterious ornaments on his head, and told us in a very nervous tone.</p>
<p>Before Dingyuan's gold store was robbed, he had always maintained a British gentleman's attitude; his actions were regular, and his words were measured; although he was not very energetic, he was not very decadent either. But if you compare his appearance at that time with his current appearance, they are simply two different people. Now Dingyuan is not only decadent, but simply can be said to be very颓废.</p>
<h3>The Reenactment of History</h3>
<p>Former British Prime Minister McDonald had a famous saying: "If you want to establish a political system, you should use the past of your own country as a measure." The so-called past of your own country refers to history. Counselor Xun said that politics is the transformation of history, and that to do politics, one must understand the traces of governance, chaos, prosperity, and decline from history, and know the present from the past.</p>
<p>China has been established for 5,000 years. The clan, culture, and customs have their own traditions, so although history does not repeat itself, there are many similar and inherited places. Among the countless examples, I will give the most recent example.</p>
<p>In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China, Japan announced its surrender. Our government issued an order appointing Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and others as commanders. For a time, public opinion was surprised and suspicious. At that time, I believed that the government officials had read the history of the Song Dynasty and imitated the story of Zhang Bangchang being crowned king. According to the Song Gaozong's enthronement in Tokyo, Zhang Bangjing led the government. Gaozong initially did not blame him and made him the King of Tongan County. Five days later, he went to the Dudu Hall. Then Li Gang presented a memorial with ten accusations, the first of which was accusing traitors. Zhang Bangchang finally surrendered to the law. All those who had rebelled confessed their crimes one after another. In order to prevent the puppet organization from splitting and rebelling, the government wanted to take and give it, which was definitely a virtuous measure. Although Zhang Bangchang was accepted by the Jin Dynasty, he still did not abolish the title of the Song Dynasty and called himself the "provisional government." Wang Zhaoming imitated his predecessors and boldly called himself the "Acting Chairman of the National Government."</p>
<p>It's better not to mention the history of the Song Dynasty. Mentioning the history of the Song Dynasty is really shocking. The disaster of the Song Dynasty originated in the Northeast. In the first phase, the Liao people invaded. In the second phase, the Jin people overwhelmed the Liao people, and the Song Dynasty lost half of its territory. In the third phase, the Yuan people rose in the north of the desert, and the great mountains and rivers fell for nearly a hundred years. I advise my compatriots to read history and raise their vigilance! Lu Shi</p>
<h3>On Crabs (A Paper Discussion)</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>Su Dongpo's poem: "It's a vain bother holding the new crab in my left hand, idly smelling the fallen blossoms." Wang Anshi's poem: "Overseas pearls often enter the market, human fish and crabs are not worth money." Tang Yin's poem: "The earth stove overflows with pine flower wine, just returning from picking crabs by the stream." A year passes easily, and again it's almost the Double Ninth Festival, chrysanthemums bloom with yellow brilliance, the atmosphere becomes desolate. In this clear and bright autumn weather, climbing high and looking far, drinking heartily with dogwood, holding wine and crabs, composing poetry and appreciating the scenery, is truly a pleasure of three lifetimes. At present, dark green large crabs are already crowding the market, but their high prices, often costing a fortune, make people astonished. A group of friends who rely on fixed salaries to maintain their families can only sigh with longing for crabs, lamenting their misfortune. I remember Fan Shi-hu, after returning to his old age in the countryside, had a poem: "Unable to afford fields, I just plant water." Befriending people in the marketplace often leads to such extreme boredom. Seeing new crabs scuttling about, how can one not drool? Since "buying crabs" is said to be "without money," why not discuss them on paper? Dreaming of plums and drawing cakes is better than nothing, so today I will write about the lore of crabs.</p>
<p>According to those skilled at eating crabs: those who know how to eat them, before eating, it is a complete crab, and after eating the crab meat, they can still assemble it into a complete crab shape without difficulty. This skill requires decades of crab-eating experience and training. Ordinary people who eat crabs often chew the crab shell and meat into a mess.</p>
<p>Crabs can be said to be a type of pest, and the situation is even worse at certain times. The Pingjiang Chronicle states: "In the Dingwei year of the Dade era, crabs in Wu were as dangerous as locusts. The fields were full, and they were all killed and swept away." These types of crabs are also called field crabs, and are very harmful to crops.</p>
<p>Regarding books describing crabs, Song Dynasty Chuan Gong once wrote "Crab Spectrum." Gao Si-sun compiled "Crab Treatise," describing the appearance of crabs in great detail.</p>
<p>Generally, people eat crabs in various ways: boiled crabs, marinated crabs, stewed crabs, fried crabs, steamed crabs, honey crabs, etc. Some more special methods include: people in Luoyang like to eat stir-fried crabs, people in Anhui like to eat vinegar crabs, people in Jiangxi like to eat pickled crabs, and previously Lu Zhu-gao loved to eat wine-drenched crabs, and Emperor Tang Minghuang liked to eat seasoned crabs.</p>
<p>Xunzi said: "Crabs have six knees and two claws," which is actually a mistake. We have never seen crabs with eight legs. Only during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the kingdom of Shanyuan presented a crab that was nine feet long and had a hundred legs and four pincers. It was named the hundred-legged crab (see "Dongming Ji"), but this was an exception and special case. Ordinary crabs have eight knees and two claws.</p>
<p>The smallest crab is called "peng," and is the size of a coin (see "Guang Zhi"). Also, "bright Yue Stream hidden stone caves, also produce small crabs. Their color is red and hard, and are commonly called stone crabs." Su Shi's poem: "Stone crabs by the stream are as small as coins, glad to see the round, red jade plate," refers to this.</p>
<p>Crab meat is indeed fresh, and crab roe is particularly fatty and delicious. According to crab physiology, male crabs contain crab fat, equivalent to mammalian essence, and female crabs contain crab roe, equivalent to mammalian ovaries.</p>
<p>Crabs are most afraid of swimming weakly. "Wulei Xianggan Zhi" says: "Dead crabs fear fog," and "Shuo Yuan" also says: "Today, many crabs are covered in fog."</p>
<p>The wooden crab is also called the tree crab (see "Ben Cao"). In fact, there is no true wooden crab.</p>
<p>Crabs can also fly. The Yue Chronicle says: "Flying crabs are as small as coins, and larger ones are twice the size. They fly across the sea surface several feet, using their claws as wings."</p>
<p>The proverb says: "Shrimp arch, crab crawl." Although this is a prediction, the arched back of a shrimp symbolizes neglect of work, and the crab's sideways movement symbolizes war and chaos, which is not without reason.</p>
<h3>Three Female Generals of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ruo</p>
<p>"Female soldiers" are not a recent phenomenon in China, but the term "female soldiers" was indeed coined during the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic by Xie Bingying, the author of "Diary of a Soldier." Here, I will introduce three female generals of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to the female soldiers in the military camp:</p>
<p>Hong Xuanjiao: "During the Jintian Uprising, all those who believed in the God Worshipping Society followed with their families. The women in the army were managed by Hong Xuanjiao, organized into armies, and she called herself a marshal. Whenever the aristocratic leaders faced battle, Hong Xuanjiao rode on horseback, leading the large-footed women, wearing five-colored clothes to form a protective screen, and she was skilled in using firearms. During the battle of Changsha, the aristocratic leaders were killed in battle, and Hong Xuanjiao took command of their troops, preventing them from collapsing" (See "Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," Volume 18).</p>
<p>Xiao Sanniang: "Among the Taiping army was Xiao Sanniang, known as the female marshal, or perhaps the sister of Chao Gui. She was over twenty years old, tall and with long arms, able to command her troops on horseback, and capable of shooting with both hands. When the Taiping army conquered Zhenjiang in the second year, she led hundreds of female soldiers to climb the city walls, more brave than the male soldiers, and none could withstand them" (Ibid., Volume 20).</p>
<p>Yang Ergu: "Yang Ergu was the sister of Prince Yang Fuqing, brave and decisive, surpassing men. ... Whenever encountering battles, Ergu would tie a yellow scarf around her head, wear a bright red battle skirt, and go out with her husband, charging into battle, and no one could match her. She could also throw knives to stab people on horseback, with perfect accuracy. Those hit would fall instantly. ... She called herself the 'Flying Knife Divine Hand'" (Ibid., page 39).</p>
<p>Moreover, from the Heavenly King's edict (see "Edict of the Mandate of Heaven") on the 30th day of the second month (during the time in Yong'an): "Male generals and female generals all hold knives, only changing clothes when appearing. Together with one heart, boldly kill the demons, and the gold and treasure are secondary. ... Men wear dragon robes and women wear flowers, all are loyal ministers and meritorious servants." It can be seen that these female generals and men stood equally in battle merit and status.</p>
<h3>Yin Wengong</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>One of the Biographies of Qing People</p>
<p>In Yuan Zicai's poetry and prose collection, he often mentions Minister Yin, namely Wengong. Zicai loved to criticize people throughout his life, but he had no harsh words for Wengong, partly because he valued the relationship between teacher and student, and partly because Yin Gong's morals were impeccable. Now, I will excerpt from the official history to convey his important virtues:</p>
<p>Gong's name was Zhishan, with the courtesy name Yuanzhang, originally from the Zhangjia clan, a Manchu of the Bordered Yellow Banner. His father, Yin Tai, asked Emperor Shizong, "Will my son serve in office?" He replied, "My fifth son, Yin Zhishan, passed the Shuntian provincial examination." The Emperor said, "He should be made to see me." Later, Gong became a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) and was presented to the Emperor, who was pleased and said, "Are you Yin Tai's son? Truly a great talent!" From then on, he was known to Emperor Shizong (Yongzheng) and Emperor Gaozong (Qianlong). He served as governor-general of Yun-Gui once, Sichuan-Shaanxi three times, and Liangjiang four times, holding high office for over thirty years. In his later years, he was summoned into the cabinet, concurrently managing the affairs of the Ministry of War and serving as the chief instructor of the Imperial Study. He died in the thirty-sixth year of Qianlong's reign.</p>
<p>Gong had a fair complexion, was introverted in his youth, had a large mouth, a clear and loud voice, and his entire body was covered with red spots, as bright as cinnabar. At the age of thirty, after five years in mourning garb, he was appointed governor-general. Once, in a single month, he concurrently held nine seals, including the general, lieutenant general, governor, river transport, surveillance commissioner, and academic director of the upper and lower Liangjiang provinces. Yet Gong's judgments were swiftly made without backlog. During his spare time, he would discuss essays and poems with the students, which astonished and impressed those who heard it.</p>
<p>Gong had a generous and magnanimous demeanor, and was eager to promote young talents. At that time, Yuan Zicai was living in Suiyuan, which happened to be within Gong's jurisdiction as governor-general of Liangjiang. Therefore, they exchanged poems and wines almost every day. Zicai's ability to enjoy the pleasures of mountain forests and gain widespread fame was largely due to Gong's promotion. In the Qing Dynasty, only a handful of Manchu officials were as distinguished in talent and literary ability as Gong.</p>
<h3>The Blessing of the Sun</h3>
<p>— Qiyuan</p>
<p>In the spring of 1933, George Bernard Shaw visited Shanghai, just as the spring rain had stopped and the sun was peeking out from the black clouds. So someone, trying to please him, said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Shaw, you are truly blessed to be able to see the sun in Shanghai."</p>
<p>But without hesitation, he replied, "No, it is the sun's blessing to be able to see George Bernard Shaw in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Old Age and Leisure</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese family education promoted and encouraged pretending to be old. A child of only three or five years old had to pretend to be refined and courteous, sometimes solemn and dignified, even prematurely aged, otherwise they wouldn't appear to be well-educated children from scholarly families. When they got a little older, they took pride in doing nothing – being idle – and considered it shameful to work, because only those who could afford to be idle showed that their ancestors were virtuous. The tea houses in Beijing and Suzhou are typical examples of this. However, it must be said that being an official was an exception. People with high noses and green eyes have slightly different views on these situations. I remember when Anthony Eden was appointed Foreign Secretary, he was about forty-three years old, and reporters called him a young diplomat. In the eyes of us Chinese, a forty-three-year-old person is old enough, and many feel that they are in the twilight years of their life. If someone is still working at sixty, people will laugh at them for having bad luck in their old age, and they will feel like they have a hard life, because we Chinese should be idle. Although Americans manufacture 1937 models of cars in 1936, we are lucky, we can buy them if we have money, why bother using our brains, we always get the advantage. People with high noses and green eyes take pride in being busy with work and consider it shameful to be idle. They are really fools. In London or Paris, there are very few men strolling on the streets during work hours, and most of the people on the roads are women. Men are all working, unless they are unemployed or have a special reason to be on the streets. In our Chinese cities, you can always see men strolling on the streets at any time, or they are sleeping in bed, only getting up at noon. The better ones raise fish, grow flowers, or play mahjong, and their level of leisure is truly admirable. It seems that someone once said that if everyone in the world worked four hours a day in production, everyone would have enough food and clothing. This makes sense. Take Shanghai as an example, with nearly five million people. What percentage of these five million people are actually involved in production? It can be said that it is very limited. If these idle people were engaged in production, how much could they produce? Extrapolating this to the whole country, it would not be difficult to provide enough food and clothing for every Chinese person. To make people happy, everyone must love to work. Once people have work, they will not be idle. When people are not idle, they will feel young and useful.</p>
<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Miss America's Education</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, American education is the most developed in the world, and American women's education is even more developed. During World War II, American education was dominated by women. In co-educational universities, it was hard to find male students. Men had all gone to war, so male students were very popular in universities. I lived in San Marcos, Texas, where there is a Texas State Teachers College with about 2,000 students, of which less than twenty were male. Therefore, these swarms of females all desired to obtain these twenty-odd men and were willing to do anything, causing quite a stir. This phenomenon is enough to reflect the development of women's education. American women have equal status with men in the family, so they also have equal opportunities for education. From elementary school to high school, tuition fees are paid by parents. Some women start working during their school years to earn pocket money, working as babysitters, typists, waitresses, theater ticket takers, receptionists, and magazine salespersons in their spare time. Once they enter university, most are working part-time while studying. They work as elementary school teachers or waitresses, while attending classes at the university. Their lives are quite diligent, and there are definitely none who can sit down and study full-time. Therefore, the economic responsibility of American women's parents is not unlimited. Some women even contribute part of their income to supplement the family. University students rarely ask their parents for money. The tuition fee for a state university for the entire period is only twenty-odd dollars. A modern woman who is unable to earn back even this twenty-odd dollar tuition fee is simply not fit to be an American. Many of my female classmates use summer vacations to work, which can maintain half a year to a year of living expenses. They do not expect economic help from their boyfriends. The economic limits of a boyfriend are, at most, treating them to dinner. Only with a special relationship can they give gifts of clothing. Therefore, American women do not easily ask their boyfriends to buy clothes unless they are engaged or cohabiting. American women regard education as a part of life and do not see it as a tool for making a living. Because there are many old ladies in their seventies and eighties in the university, they do not work outside and have no intention of further study to improve their livelihood skills, but they are keen to study. Their grades are not as good as those of young people. They don't value academic credits at all, nor are they intoxicated with degrees. Even if they get a doctorate at such an old age, they cannot bring it into the coffin. They take the school as a place to cultivate personality. They believe that education has the effect of prolonging life, and at the same time, they feel that as they get older, their knowledge inevitably becomes outdated. They listen to the high-level discussions of young professors and exchange opinions with the younger generation. Only in this way can they keep up with the progress of the times. Therefore, American old ladies know who the Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is, while Chinese old ladies don't know who Truman is. To develop Chinese women's education, we must also open the doors of schools. Many young Chinese women are excluded from schools because they lack the economic means, and old ladies in their seventies and eighties are even more unable to enter. If an old lady with a cane walked into any university classroom to study, I'm afraid she would be driven out of the school by the president, professors, and students, who would say, "At your age, shouldn't you be at home taking care of your grandchildren? Why come here to suffer?"</p>
