<h3>外蒙騎兵侵入新疆　蘇機不斷參加轟炸　我外交當局決提出抗議</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化九日電〕據此間軍事當局接阿山區專員阿斯滿及白塔山駐軍報稱：本月五日午，外蒙騎兵一營，配合軍用汽車多輛携帶輕重武器，向我白塔山駐軍進攻，當時並有蘇聯標　飛機四架臨空掩護，投彈掃射。我軍民頗有死傷，現外蒙騎兵已深入國境六百華里，我軍正奮力阻止前進。按白塔山在新疆奇台東北三百五十餘華里，阿斯滿專員原駐承化，自本年二月起，歷受某方之武力壓迫，節節退讓，四月中旬退抵白塔山。</p>
<p>〔中央社迪化十日電〕白塔山戰事仍繼續進行中，蘇聯標誌飛機，仍不斷分批轟炸我陣地。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕半官人士十日聲稱，大隊外蒙軍在蘇聯軍用機四架掩護下，本月五日開始進攻中國西北部，現已深入二百哩之遙，軍用機向中國城鎮轟炸掃射，民衆死傷頗多。首都各報新疆訪員紛紛來電報告外蒙軍進侵詳情。一說外蒙騎·步·砲兵已侵入新疆。國防部發言人對此傳說，拒不置評。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕據悉：關於外蒙古軍隊侵入我新疆界及漆有蘇聯標幟之飛機參加轟炸一事，我外交當局將於十一日提出抗議，聞抗議書可能於十一日下午送交蘇聯大使彼特羅夫轉交外蒙古共和國政府。我抗議書之送交蘇方轉與外蒙政府，係由於我國雖已承認外蒙之獨立，但兩國間尚未派外交使節之故。據此間當局接獲消息：外蒙軍隊侵入新疆，係在四月中旬，而現時蒙軍侵入我國境界之深度達六百華里，迄最近五日午蒙軍再度開始進攻，並有蘇聯飛機四架參加，我防軍宋希濂部以守土有責，已予抵抗，戰事正在白塔山一帶進行中，按蒙軍侵入我新疆境內，此爲第三次。</p>
<p>（按：十日倫敦廣播，亦報道外蒙軍侵新疆之消息。）</p>
<h3>行政院第七次會通過　國大不另建會堂　檳榔嶼港決設立領事館</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕行政院第七次會議，十日上午九時舉行，張院長主席，外交·國防報告外，決議各案擇載如次：甲，報告事項：（一）交部民用航空局航空站組織規程案，（二）特任郭懺爲聯勤總司令，黃鎭球爲參謀次長案，（三）派李榦爲出席聯合國經濟曁社會理事會亞洲及遠東經濟委員會第二代表案。乙，討論事項：（一）國民大會堂工程案，決議就原有國民大會堂拆去主席台後，房間向後延伸會塲面積，不另新建會塲，（二）江蘇等三省卅六年度總預算案，決議通過。（三）聯合國各組織及人員，在華應享受之特權及豁免辦法案，決議通過。（四）縣市參議會在地方自治未完成前，對於縣市財政監督辦法案，決議修正通過。（五）有關監察委員選舉之案件，在中央應由何機關辦理　，決議由內政部辦理。（六）設立　　港領事館案，決議通過。（七）外交部　將駐金山總領事改爲簡任官等案，決議通過。（八）張家口設市案，決議通過。丙，任免事項：（一）派顧毓瑔兼全國經濟委會副秘書長。（二）任命崔敬伯爲河北省政府委員。（三）寗夏省政府委員李鈵　請辭職，應予免職，任命張濟美爲寗夏省政府委員。（四）國防部陸軍中將次長林蔚，晋加上將銜。（五）任命林可勝兼國防醫學院院長。（六）任命董文琦爲東北水利工程總局局長。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕行政院十日開會，決定以外交使節特權賦予聯合國機構駐華代表，助理，顧問，專家及秘書人員等，不受中國法庭管轄，豁免所得稅，初入中國時私人財產免徵關稅，且可享受交通便利。聯合國駐華各機關並具有信函，不受政府檢查，收發密電，財產免徵直接稅，收發印刷文件時，免徵關稅等特權。</p>
<h3>民社黨新舊派　均作積極活動</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕民社黨之分裂，似已無可避免，張君勱現已決心整理黨務，並將開除梁秋水，萬武（國社十發起人之一）之黨籍，並派出大批人員，赴各地活動。反對派之革新委會，亦決定於下月召開民社黨全國代表大會，並派出若干人員，分赴各地區爭取黨員同情。梁秋水今已自滬搭輪返北平，日內赴津，保聯絡。廬廣聲不日亦將來平與梁秋水同往東北，伍憲子刻猶舉棋不定，將來可能與革新會合流，亦可能脫離民社，重樹「憲政黨」旗幟。伍氏本擬返港，因在野某鉅公挽留在滬觀望大局，行期有待。梁秋水返平後，即接見記者，暢述調處黨內糾紛失敗經過，並稱民社黨革新會爲真正「王麻子剪刀」，因國社黨共有十發起人，除徐勦，王搏沙，胡石靖故去，陳博生，張東蓀脫黨，劉玉書以漢奸在押外，尚餘四發起人，張君勱方面僅有彼自己一人，革新會尚擁有三人，即本人與萬武，湯薌銘。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港十日電〕蔡廷鍇頃以民盟負責人章伯鈞發表談話中，涉及其代表民主促進會加入民盟，今特函華僑日報更正謂，彼個人及民主促進會，並未加入民盟，並謂，近有不肖之徒，造謠生事，假借促進會或彼個人名義，組織民軍等，應由當局予以法律制裁。</p>
<h3>憲政會研究委會　舉行召集人會議</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕憲政實施促進會研究委員會，十日上午十時於國大會堂二樓舉行召集人會議，到委員賀揚靈等，由劉振東主席，經交換意見後，旋即討論各委員提案，末並決定該會第三次會議召集日期，定於聯席會議前一是舉行。</p>
<h3>英王明日誕辰　主席特電致賀</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕外交界息：本月十二日爲英王生辰，蔣主席已去電致賀。</p>
<h3>菲律濱排華巨魁　沙禿數典忘祖　祖父爲華人今竟領導排華</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺十日電〕菲律賓排華同盟之存在與活動，業經證實。該同盟主席沙禿，頃向中央社記者坦白承認，此褊狹國家主義排外性之機構，係由其領導。記者詢以中菲友好條約，今已簽訂多日，排華同盟，是否與友好之精神相悖？何以迄今尚無解散趨勢？沙禿答稱：排華同盟，刻在「表面上」仍繼續存在與活動，該同盟係於兩年前組成，其目的純在保護菲國人民之權益，尤以欲保障菲人之經濟利益，而有該項組織之產生，刻會員已達千人，惟吾人既非排斥中國或全部中國人民，而僅爲保障本身權益，故排華同盟一詞，或不甚適宜，吾人當思有更正之。記者係於菲參議院討論有關僑胞法案時與沙禿晤談者，此身長六尺，而面色灰白有如烟鬼之排華巨魁，現已年逾六旬，出任「梭隆」時僅一年（菲人稱議員爲Solon，賢者之意），然提出之法案，行將近百，因之有賜以「一日一案議員」之頭銜者，而沙禿則反以此爲榮。彼所提各法案，以排外性者居多，且以此而獲得一部選民之無條件擁護。沙禿與記者談話時，常作奸笑，其額上之皺紋，足以說明其欺詐犯罪流亡等不名譽之經歷。據僑界消息：沙禿原爲無業流氓，幼年犯強姦罪逃港，因受當地流氓之欺凌，致種下恨惡華人之心理，後以賄賂方式，結束姦案，而以排外立塲獲選爲議員。至其在菲島淪陷期間所爲何事，則已不可考矣。據沙禿自稱：彼定本月杪國會休會時，週遊世界，並將赴中國之首都南京一行。我駐馬尼刺總領事館業界以免費簽證。在京擬作二三日之勾留，可能時或將晋謁蔣主席。記者詢以「晋謁蔣主席何爲？」沙禿答稱：「致敬而已，余固敬重蔣主席也」。沙禿自承彼祖父爲中國人，並告記者謂：妻已逝世，但遺有子二女一，均業律師。</p>

<p>〔本報太原十日電〕晋南，晋西現正收麥，共軍集中全力搶割東運太岳區，臨汾局勢因之暫告鬆弛。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原十日電〕據頃自王台逃并難民稱：共軍近在該縣第三區之石佛寺，設立手榴彈製造廠，將窟頭一帶炭塲全部侵佔，刻正積極搜集鋼鐵等軍火原料，並決定銷毀具有歷史之顯通寺　殿銅塲，並稱：朱德現潛居台懷鎭寺內，不時集合討論保衛晋冀察邊區根據地，爲死灰復燃之圖，渠等並在五台倡行所謂「全面澈底政治清算」，亦名「除黑點」，凡曾與政府有關人士及其眷屬，均在「清算」之列。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十日電〕保綏署軍事首腦集北平，孫連仲留平，冀東綏靖區司令侯鏡如昨抵平，上官副主任明可來平，冀軍事有新配置，孫連仲稱：共軍爲配合東北攻勢，在北寗綫津榆段發動之攻勢，已被國軍擊破。</p>
<p>〔本報保定十日電〕滄縣情勢趨穏，犯十二戶共軍，昨晚被擊後撤，保定週邊共軍集結中，平保綫一部國軍南調增防。北寗沿綫仍不靖，唐山外圍續有共軍　踞，開平附近共軍亦正趕築工事，共軍有加強滋擾北寗路，並進犯唐山企圖。</p>
<h3>豫省救濟難胞</h3>
<p>分別予以急賑及收容</p>
<p>〔中央社鄭州九日電〕豫北形勢近雖鬆弛，但大批難胞續由封邱延津等縣轉道南來。目前留鄭難民在施粥廠就食者，約五千人，另有四千餘人，正由急救難民會辦理遣送附近各縣寄養，或介紹工作中。離散孤兒，已由豫省社會處急賑大隊收容。冀南難胞散居鄭，汴，新鄉，郾城者約萬餘人，社會處正與綏靖區急賑大隊會商救濟，即以中央前專案撥給之三億元發放急賑。魯南難胞經豫北來鄭者，共約四百人，省府亦已向中央請求撥發特款救濟。安陽城內需要食糧之人民，共計三十萬，省方已將籌購食糧五百噸中之半數，在廿日內以空運投擲城內。因共軍攻犯豫北，而使二十餘所學校　學學生共一萬餘人，南下鄭汴者約佔半數，其中二千餘人即可在最近復課，餘均自願投入青年軍，但彼等希望當局能以過去優先辦理，准於在一年後恢復學業。安陽學生五千餘人，省方決定空運南來。至豫北籍之在鄭汴求學學生，連同最近由豫北來鄭學生二千餘人請求公費救濟。上述難胞學生之救濟，中央已准撥十五億元，省方已由田糧款項及豫南急賑款項中挪用十三億元。蔣主席及行總准予撥發之麫粉一千噸，豫分署俟奉令後即發放。</p>

<h3>參政會和平建議　遭共黨新華社污蔑詆毀</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕自參政會電中共呼籲和平，並請共黨籍參政員即日蒞京參加大會，恢復和談，一般人莫不予以寄望，但爲時已久，迄無回響，本月五日，新華社廣播該社社論，題爲：「破車不能再開」，對參政會一番謀取和平之苦心，冷加污蔑詆毀，指該會爲「反動份子佔絕大多數的，共產黨人所從未參加的國民參政會，雖有極少數真心希望和平的人亦缺少經騐，故不能對這次參政會懷抱幻想」，該社又誣：「國民參政會的真面目，爲狂熱的擁護內戰，是一個呼籲戰爭的機關，人們絕對不能，也不應相信它的什麼和平呼籲」。並譏辱參政會誠意表示之「請中共參政員來京出席，共策國是」，「請中共速派代表來京，與政府雙方無條件恢復和談」，「請該會主席團及駐會委員會，本此次大會決議之精神，於最短期間促成和平之實現」等，爲「兩碗豆腐，就是豆腐兩碗」，該社評論參政會此次大會精神，請政府再度聲明政治解決，就是請政府「迅增大軍清剿共匪」，故其結論稱：「參政會的和平建議，不幸簡直是個爛釵子美人」。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南十日電〕十日共軍繼續由膠濟綫以北及黃河北岸向鐵路南回竄，大部已到沂蒙山區附近。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十日電〕魯境新的大戰，已如箭在弦上，有一觸即發之勢，前渡河接收新兵之共軍，除有一部留駐桓台，章邱一帶外，其餘俱回竄膠濟路以南，迄十日仍繼續移動中。共軍月初以來，前所發動之協助居民大規模搶麥運動已告完成，並規定每戶按口配給糧食三個月，餘悉由共軍保管。居民對此既不敢怒，更不敢言，自豫北回竄黃河以北壽張一帶之劉伯誠部，又揚言將渡河竄擾魯西南國軍側背，國軍已嚴陣以待。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十日電〕魯南收復莒縣國軍，十日績向城郊搜剿，並連克煤窰·石灰窰等據點，當有共軍區長率地方民兵二百餘向國軍投誠，民衆夾道歡呼，情緒倍極熱烈。又向沂水西南玉皇山高崗子之綫掃蕩之國軍，十日在玉皇山殲共軍二百餘人。又共軍第三·四·六·八·四個縱隊，集結博山·淄川地區，加緊戒備。又魯東日照共軍，連日將物資往諸城搬運。</p>

<h3>陳嘉庚表示　未參加政黨</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡九日電〕陳嘉庚今日於中央社記者詢其關於羅隆　所發表之聲明時，否認渠爲民主同盟之主要人物。渠稱，當孫總理首次訪問馬來亞之時，曾邀渠加入同盟會，而自茲以後，渠即未加入任何政黨，此後陳氏於返華興學時，其同僚多紛紛加入若干政黨，渠則因對政治無興趣，故始終未參加任何政黨。</p>

<h3>經會繼牘討論經濟措施　糧食配售即實行　徵收財產稅交小組研究</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕全國經委會工作已進入具體而切實階段．該會十日午從開會時，對糧食，貼補等間題，成作實際研討。關於出售國營事業問題，會中讀加討鑰，原則上已有決定，惟因茲事體大，加以各機關清單尚未提出，決仍請張嘉　，翁文灝，　桐孫等詳加研究，並整理文字，俾於下次曾中提出。關於糧食配售問題，　食中詳密研究結果，今後四個月內，各大都市民食決可無處。座十月份以後，糧食來源亦芷籌搆中，相信不致有多大間題。當間原定先在九大都市配售，現順京，滬，平，津人口稠密，需糧較股，決先實施，配　對象友如何使真正平民公教人員感能沾其利等問題，會中亦曾詳加檢討。另一為會中重視之問題為貼補政策，原則上，貼補將逐漸減少，現在高潮具體開列名單，俾研究何者應停止貼補，何者應減少，何者應將其盈錄繳付國庫。此外，在節流方面，若干機關預算列入而仍未成立者，應停止設立，辦理無成效者，亦將研討何者應效，何者應縮。至一般所關心之一次財產稅問題，財部所擬之課征方案，會中亦曾加以討論，亦因技術上尚有須加研討之處，交財政小組　　研究，俟會中決定後，再交產院完成立法程序，予以實施。其他新稅之開閘或舊稅之整理，皆有關列詳細數字之必要，亦交該組研究。總這，在開源節流方面，該會正作技術性之具體檢討，俾明暸下半年度總收支情形，以為他日未雨　　之計。該會今日係於下午三時許開會，由張　生席，出席翁文灝，谷正倫，俞鴻鈞等二十餘人，至下午八時　始散。下星期一將再開四次會，各小組亦將於週內鑼續開會。</p>

<h3>美開放日對外貿易事　我當局極為重視　滬工商界認出口貿易將受威脅</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕財政經濟負責方面對美國開放日本對外貿易事極重視。又據熟悉商塲情形者談：各地早已有廠價日貨發現，若干且係以他國公司出品為名而實際係日木製造之商品，此事殊堪重視。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國務院及陸軍部宣佈美將於木年八月十五日起，開放日本對外貿易後，此間進出口貿易界，認為開放時期過早，結果又將造成日本為我國際質易之競爭者。該方而指出：我國之出口物资，如紗布·生絲·草帽·鈕子·洋傘柄·鱼产品等，均將遭受劇烈之威脅。目前我國以時局不靖，地方多難，生產未能納入正軌，而日本在盟軍之管制下，生產逐步復原。幣制安定，工資尤為　　，故在生產條件方面言，實足為我之嚴重威脅。故甚望我國商務代表團赴日時，應據理力爭，促請盟軍加嚴管制。</p>
<p>又據紡識界某鉅子語記者︰日本棉紡業，刻已恢複至三百萬錠之譜，此數已足敷全國衣著，而尚有餘額外銷。惟盟軍以紡織業為日本最易恢復之輕工業，且易於易取外匯，故有准於本年內增開至六百萬錠之說。果達此數，則南洋方面之紗布市塲，我又將遭受日貨劇烈之競爭。而尤足懲者，即豐界機器廠，在戰時迄未受損，對紗錠機器之生產，恢復殊速。果盟軍管制鬆懈，聽任發展，則日本紡織事業，前途殊未可漠視。憔依目前趨勢言，日本紡織業，在短期內，尚不致予我以重大威脅，而嚴重性則尚潛伏於其前途之發展云。</p>
<h3>晉省早後喜雨</h3>
<p>〔本報太原十日電〕晉京今春苦旱，迄今麥苗猶遍野，最佳之處，收成減半，秋不已誤下種，太原區八日九日突雨，間息細雨兩日夜，十日綿綿普降，迄午已得二寸，氣候儼如深秋，透雨之象已成，人民皆大歡喜，準備耕種，惟可赶種者，僅短期成熟之黍谷，　麥，玉蜀黍等，已無滿收之望。</p>
<h3>日冀先訂定匯率　藏相商相對麥帥措施猶表不滿</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十日電〕此間人士頃談稱：麥帥決定於日本投降二週年紀念日（八月十五日）開放日本對外私人貿易關係事，實可視為戰爭結東後日本之最重大事件。此輩人士對此雖引為滿意，但亦深知在日本確實恢復對外貿易關係之前，尚有種種問題須待解決。藏相矢野頃加以評曰：此則先須規定日元之匯率，否則日本商人對外通商時難免發生困難。日本對外貿易協會會長中嘉亦強調先須解決匯率間題，并提出恢復日本國際貿易之條件有二：（一）輸入原料，尤其是棉花，羊毛，橡皮，鐵皮等物；（二）解決賠價問題，俾使日本工業界可以利用留存之設備，進行生產計劃。日本金融界人士則調麥帥之決議雖不無缺點，但亦足使日本之將來經濟獲得光明之前途，早日擭得和平云、</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十日電〕商工相水谷十日發表談話稱：「日本即可迎接外國之貿易代表團，不勝感謝。惟日本之貿易，仍將在聯合之管制下進行，且對外匯率一時尚未能決定，誠美中不足，故即使恢復貿易，僅祗為代表團與貿易廳之問進行之質易而己」。</p>
<p>私人初步交易將為物物交換</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕按照陸軍部與國務院聯合宣佈：「私人貿易商與日本製造商交易者，將由麥帥總部評價專家對貿易貨物，決定公允價格。」則私人貿易商與日本之初步交易，大半將為物物交換，而以原料換取日本之手工藝品及絲織綢緞。麥帥總部與日方官員均預料私人商業在開始期內，不過將刺激美日政府現巳進行之有限制出口貿易，至於日本大量製造出口品，因原料匱乏，貽償辦法未定，及國內經濟調整不善等原因，尚不可能。例如大孤工業區各廠現已開工者，不足全部工作能力百分之二十五，其主因乃在商界對賠償辦法，猶豫未決，且煤斤，滑油與電力俱感缺乏。據麥帥總部官員寬見：私人貿易商（初步以四百人為限）赴日，當可使目前出口　稍增，預料彼等將指導日本製造適合美國人所好之絲織品及藝術品，以代目前一般日商所造式樣陳舊之出品，玆將鼓動日人多造陶器等物品。</p>
<p>澳洲政府要求增加澳商名額</p>
<p>八月十五日以後准許赴日之私人貿易代表，係由各國分派，澳洲政府反響極為迅速，已宣布將請麥帥總部增加洲洲商人代表名額，其原因為澳洲之「地理位置」關係及戰前對日貿易額頗廣大。</p>
<h3>粵各地雨成災　粵漢路英德大橋被沖毀　惠陽水深數尺商業停頓</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十日電〕粵各地旬來露雨，致各江潦水暴漲，災情慘重，為廿年來所罕見，水陸交通均受影饗。粵漢路英德大橋被沖毀橋墩五個，故粵漢車又告中止北上。東北兩江水勢最列，最高惠州水位達一二·〇公尺，右龍亦高至一一·五〇公尺，沿江兩岸俱成澤國，惠陽城內水深三四尺，商業停頓。農作物損失尤鉅，被淹良田達數萬畝。築成未久之罵鞍國，因新土未堅，被衝微口干餘丈，慈威閘亦被衝破，附近村民集合二千餘人，竭力搶救，惟險勢未減，此間水利局已派出大批人員，赴各地督導搶修堤圍工程。幸十日起天已放晴，江永漲度已緩。</p>
<h3>日本內閣通過　緊急經濟措施　內容須待盟總同意</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京九日電〕日本內閣本日通過關於恢復出口貿易之緊急經濟措施。會中並對討論過去二年來總部控制下出入口計劃所發生之不平衡狀態，最近瀕于危機之可能性。又六七兩日，與經濟安定本都長官和田博雄會晤擬定緊急經濟計劇之各經濟部門首長，強調日本需要改革經濟，生產可輸出之貨品，以償付必要之輸入品。緊急經濟措施之詳細。上週片山哲曾稱：緊急經濟計劃，主要仰賴民眾之支持。內閣方面人士今夜復稱：內閣之執行本日通過之措施，頗賴勞工之擁護。商工相水谷長三郎於閣議後談稱：政府並不認為共產黨有領導工會阻撓勞工對此項措施支持之力量，內閣經濟計劃可反映日本政府為求挽救當前局勢之努力，蓋美人己漸怨恨為日人購買食糧，並已不欲再供原斜。片山內閣希望假藉以下之方法，即採集足敷工業使用之煤，制止黑市，穩定國內經濟，制止通貨膨脹，吸收有聯緊之工會人物，而奠定恢復出口工業之基礎。丙闖人士承認解決經濟問題，並非完全國內之車，在可以開始生產大量出口貨之前，自國外輸入原料，亦屬必需。緊急經濟措施間接強調日本現在情勢以及簽訂和約後問題問之關係，且贊成麥帥之論調，即日本已準備簽訂和約，故應　速簽訂本日通過之經濟方案。一般雖反映社會主義背景，暨則為與民主黨這妥協，蓋該黨除國家管制基本之煤礦業外，極力反對工業之社會主義化也。至於設立新出口工業之目標，在目前對於任何日本政府，不論其政治理想如何，均屬自然之舉。</p>

<h3>豈可再鼓勵日本！</h3>
<p>美國合眾社華盛幀九日電稱，美國務院已正式宣佈，開放日本對外貿易，自八月十五日起，外商代表四百人，即可前往日本，恢複私人貿易；並得直接與日本廠商無限制接觸。這一個電訊的傳來，雖來我們意料之中；但是在對日和會尚未召鬨日本賠償問題猶未解決少前，即開放日本對外貿易，無論從那一個角度去觀察，終覺得此舉未免言之過早了。</p>
<p>美國為了加速日本經濟復興及減輕美國納稅人的負擔起見，欲開放日本的對外貿易，由來已久。上月初遠東委員會即表示希望，能於本年七月間開放日本民間對外貿易，並曾徵詢中菲兩國政府對於此一問題的意見：同時英美兩國貿易代表團，又復先後赴日實地考察，現在終於不顧中菲兩國的反對，而決定自八月十五日起恢復日本對外貿易；這個重要的措置，不論為遠東的和平計，或是為美國本身的利益計，美國實有重加考盧的必要。</p>
<p>菲律濱政府反對開放日本對外貿易，早已有嚴正的表示，不過非國政府的觀點，僅偏於賠償問題方面，他們認為開放日本對外貿易之後，使日本獲得一恢復工業生產的機會，日本便可以此為藉口，要求保留日本的工業設備，從而影響及日本對菲國賠償物資的給付。至於我國反對開放日本對外貿易的理由，除了菲國的見解而外，我們並認為在盟國對日和約未簽訂與日本賠償問題未解決之前，絕不能容許日本與外國恢復私人貿易的。因為日本在戰前是一個高度工業化的國家：日本的進口貿易，以糧食·棉花·羊毛等物為大宗；而其出口貿易，則以棉織品生絲茶時等為大宗；不僅獨佔了南洋一帶的市塲；而且在世界商品市塲上，也佔據著一個非常重要的地位。尤其是日本的綿織物一項，在世界市塲上，向為英美的勁敵。所以開放日本對外貿易，不僅足以妨害我國紡織工業的成長，而且英美在市塲上又將害我國紡織工業的成長，而且英美在市場上又將遭遇到一個勁敵了。</p>
<p>最近數月以來，戰敗的日本，又在那裏蠢蠢思動，業已昭然若揭的了。亦軍備方面，日本曾要求盟國給予「小量軍力」；在領士方面，日本企圖與美國共同託管硫球　島，並希望在台灣取得特別移民權；在經濟方面，日本人所提出的要求，更是不一而足。其中最重要的一項，莫過於日本要求減少充作賠償的工業設備。據新亞社東京九日電訊，日本政府對於賠償問題，在表面上表現極端順從，但在實際上則利用種種方法，企圖減低賠償的負擔。社會黨摟已組成一個「賠償對策委員會」，且已決定三項原則，（一）在麥帥總部已指定之賠償工廠之中，調查並研究其有關復興日本產業之機器，縱屬一座機械，或一所工塲，亦應具體向麥帥提出理由，申請發還日本。（二）在麥帥總部已指定之賠償工場中，調查並研究其有關維持國民最低生活之設備，應向麥帥申請發還日本。（三）盡量向社會說明前兩項之實際情形，以喚起一般人民的注意。</p>
<p>由此可知，日本的處心積慮了。日本對待美國的一言一動，頗似我國歷史上「勾踐之事夫差」的故事。美國尤許開放日本對外貿易，不啻予日人以一大鼓勵，所以我們不能不向美國當局大聲疾呼，美國須知姑息足以養奸，一味的寬大，勢必自誤誤人，共結果所屆，不僅美國在太平洋上的安全，將遭受威脅，而且整個的遠東，也將無和平安定可言了。杜漸防微，美國對待日本，不可不慎，切勿上日本人的當，珍珠港事件的教訓，是永遠不可忘懷的。即以經濟的觀點而論，開放日本的對外貿易，固可減輕美國納稅人對日本的負担，但是促成日本經濟復興之後，日本的侵略野心，勢必死灰復燃；屈時美國又將如何應付？不是又要成為一嚴重間題了嗎？所以我們要求美國當局，放大眼光，正視現實，切勿貪小失大。我們竭誠盼望美國當局，為遠東和平計，同時也為本身利益計，對於開放日本對外貿易一事，能量加　慮！造成不能再鼓勵日本了。</p>
<p>要之，日本對外貿易若真開放，則在不久的將來，「價廉物美的東徉貨」，又將泛濫於世界市塲上了。戰敗國笑逐顏開，戰勝國反而愁眉不展，這真是一個可怕的對照。我們固須據理力爭，要求美國放大眼光，重行　慮其態度，將開放日本對外貿易的日期，延至對日和會閉幕之後；但是最重要的，還在我國本身，但願全國上下對於當前的局勢，即能切實反省，努力革新，提高警覺，隨時防範日本侵路思想的再生！</p>

<h3>增強西半球各國合作　杜魯門訪加拿大　加國可能參與援助歐洲</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統今夜乘專車離此，赴加拿大之渥太華作三日之友好訪問。總統夫人，女公子，白宮人員及美國與外國駐美記者四十餘人隨行。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統定今夜（上海時間星期二上午）自此間乘火車赴加拿大，作爲期三日之正式訪問。渠在加拿大時，預料可使美國與加拿大間之談判，獲得新的力量。此項談判結果或可使加拿大參加馬歇爾國務卿援助歐洲之「大陸計劃」。權威方面透露：美國及加拿大官員已曾就加拿大日趨嚴重的美元問題，討論解決辦法。該一問題之嚴重，殊不亞於許多歐洲國家所面臨之同一問題。杜魯門總統此去與加總理金氏會晤時，將就前項問題，作更進一步之討論，而美加戰時爲解決原料及生產問題所從事之合作，可能亦將予以恢復。加拿大目前對美國之貿易，亦如許多歐洲國家之輸入超過輸出。同時加拿大對英·法·荷·比及中國之貸款用罄以後，加拿大可能存有大宗外國所急需之小麥牛肉等供應品，而外國則以缺乏財力不能購買。另一方面加拿大所需煤斤油類及其他必需品，完全倚賴美國之輸入，然以加拿大缺乏美元，遂亦無能支付此等必需物品之輸入。某一專家表示：加拿大　不能繼續如前此之一方面以賒欠方式售物與歐洲，而一方面則以付現方式向美國購買。解決加拿大此一困難地位之辦法之一，即爲恢復戰時「海德公園協定」之某種方式，即由加拿大將其多餘之小麥木材牛肉等以低於美國國內市價之價格售與美國，以供出口，輸往歐洲需要之國家，此舉可以立即解決加拿大之美元問題，並可同時與美國合作，以進行對歐洲國家之大規模善後救濟計劃。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處本埠訊〕美國「呼聲電台」將於六月十二日下午六時半至七時（上海夏季時間）向中國廣播杜魯門總統對渥太華加拿大國會聯席會議之演辭。此項節目代替「吾人所愛之音樂」英語定期節目，可向下列各電台收聽：週率一五二五〇，一五一五〇，一一七九〇，一一七三〇，九六五〇，九四九〇。</p>
<h3>奧總理嚴正聲明　決不受共黨操縱　馬卿贊同歐洲聯邦計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社維也納九日電〕奧總理費格爾九日在舉行人民黨臨時會議後發表正式公告，否認渠有聯絡共黨或有辭職之意。並謂，「總理僅在奧國人民以最大多數要求其辭職之時，方才辭職，新選舉之舉行亦僅在奧大利民主共和國之憲法要求此舉時，或奧國大多數人民決定舉行投票時方始舉行」。按曾受莫斯科訓練之奧共黨領袖費歇爾前曾告訪員稱總理在最近與渠會談時，曾向渠表示，總理願擴大政府，容納更多之共產黨員，否則在舉行新選舉期際即提出辭呈。費格爾在公告中繼稱：在過去十二個月內，費歇爾曾不斷企圖與總理進行私人談話，最後總理允於六月五日舉行會談。但出於總理意外，費歇爾越出私人談話範圍之外，竟提起目前國策問題。費格爾總理繼稱，於是並未進行談判，亦未有決定，因此渠認爲並無向政府中社會黨員通知談話經過情形之理由。據美軍權威方面表示，奧經理此舉之目的，乃顯露在共黨能攫得奧國政權之前，（如同匈牙利政變）奧國共黨力量之薄弱而已。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕據今日透露：國務卿馬歇爾對歐洲聯邦原則，業已予以有條件之擁護。據國會方面可靠消息稱，馬歇爾關於參議員佛爾柏萊脫所提議案，曾致函參院外委會主席范登堡，該提案乃贊同歐洲聯邦，首次見諸國會紀錄者。馬歇爾函中稱，雖渠對歐洲聯邦主張，極表同情，但渠認爲任何國會所通過之議案，應附有序言，說明美國對任何形式之聯邦皆無成見。又據某外交家之消息稱：美國對共黨企圖強迫改組奧國政府之舉，皆加拒絕。渠稱，來自維也納此項消息，似爲共黨企圖擴張其在中東歐勢力之一部份，如在匈牙利所實行者然。惟維也納之情勢，與布達佩斯大不相同，因奧京之佔領，由英美法蘇四國共同參加，而非蘇聯單獨擔任，如在匈之情形然。渠又指出此情形不獨就維也納市爲然，并且全國亦復如此。</p>
<h3>蒲立德敦促美英法　組織歐洲民主聯盟　並揭破蘇聯對歐洲用心</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕前美國駐蘇聯大使蒲立德今夜在喬治城大學發表演說，促美英法三國應乘蘇聯尚未侵佔整個歐洲大陸之際，速即組織歐洲民主聯盟，並曰，惟有美國之軍力可以防止紅軍之佔領全歐。蒲氏謂每一歐人均知歐洲尚存之民主國家如不能團結一致，以實行互防，則此等國家將一一被蘇聯併吞。美國政府若能勸使英法政府與其共同設立歐洲民主聯盟，使具有民主制度及尊重人權法案之各國，包括德國之各邦在內，均得加入此一聯盟，始能恢復歐洲民主國人民之信任及希望。蘇聯領袖今決不敢向美國或美國之友人發動戰爭，良以彼等深知目前美國之實力遠在蘇聯及其附屬國之上，然彼等於相信其自身之實力勝於我方時，即將從事進攻。今日所能防止史達林之令紅軍佔領全歐者，惟美國武力所佔之優勢及原子炸彈耳。</p>
<h3>奧匈邊界　並不緊張</h3>
<p>〔路透社奧匈邊界九日電〕近日盛傳奧匈邊界貝拉東湖一帶，已由匈當局加緊戒備措施，然記者在邊界二十哩長之一綫上視察結果，並未發見特殊之戒備措施。布達佩斯之政治危機，對於匈牙利之農村似無甚影響。據奧國之邊界官員稱，奧匈農民每日仍照常越界往來，記者在邊界視察時，亦未見有大批難民擁入等特殊之現象。</p>
<h3>華萊士評論　匈保政局</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新澤西州紐瓦克城九日電〕　國前任商務部長華萊士本日向報界談稱：匈保兩國最近所發生之事件，乃杜魯門主義之直接後果。英美兩國已因杜魯門主義而有其希臘與土耳其兩國，蘇聯自亦應有其匈牙利及保加利亞兩國云。</p>
<h3>美政府對蘇抗議書　馬卿作最後審查　贊同設委會調查匈政變原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：國務卿馬歇爾於參加佛吉尼亞軍官學院畢業典禮後歸來，親自處理美國對匈政變應採之步驟，最後決定對蘇抗議照會之措辭。該項照會草案曾經各級政府機關傳閱，並已得英外部之同意。據官方表示，照會中並無威嚇口氣，萬一復文不能認爲滿意，美國將以本案向聯合國提出。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕國務大臣麥克尼爾在國會答議員問稱：蘇國當就匈牙利新政府之行動而施以判斷，英政府希望匈牙利政府之更動，不致因此脫離議會民主政治之原則，若有任何此等發展，即不免嚴重影響英國與匈牙利之關係。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦九日電〕關於匈牙利最近發生之政變，美國擬照會盟國管制匈牙利委員會蘇代表史維利杜夫表示抗議，其副本一份業已送達英外部。據消息靈通人士稱，英外部於接得此一副本之後，當即以覆文送達美國務院，表示英國贊成設英美蘇三強委員會，負責調查造成匈政變之各種事件。外傳匈前總理那基擬組織流亡政府，倫敦方面對於此說並無所聞云。此外，英外部方面對於保加利亞國內所發生之事件，亦正密切予以注意，保國反對黨領袖貝特柯夫被捕之後，曾引起英美兩國之強硬抗議，但保總理狄米特洛夫則斥責此項抗議爲「干涉保國之內政」。英官方人士認爲保總理之聲明不合情合理，並謂英美兩國有權監督保國是否遵守民主政治之基本法律，良以保國曾提供諾言，決計遵守此種法律故也云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社匈京九日電〕盟國管制匈牙利　　　　代理主席史維利杜夫，今日向美軍事代表團長致關簡短照會，對於美國要求給予小資產　前秘書長柯伐克斯。供詞副本一節，表示拒絕。英國要求供給副本亦已於上週被蘇方拒絕。</p>
<h3>法政府正式宣布　修正薩爾區界綫　英美兩國可望予以支持</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕法當局今日宣布：法國因經濟上之理由，已修正薩爾區邊界將薩爾堡城暫時列入法國領土，以待對德和約之簽字。法方已以正式照會分致德境佔領區其他三國當局，謂法國已將界綫自薩爾堡與特勒凡附近若干村莊向東南移動，舊界綫則將特勒凡區與其貿易區域切斷。邊界修正所影響之德國領土，均在德境法佔領區之內。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十日電〕關於解決薩爾區疆界一事，法國昨日已將其工業區面積自一千七百九十萬哩減爲一千五百七十六方哩，人口自八十八萬減爲八十五萬二千人。按該區一九一九年時之面積一千二百另四方哩，人口爲七十八萬八千人。</p>
<p>（法國新聞社巴黎九日電）官方頃宣佈：「薩爾馬克」今後爲將爲薩爾區之新幣制，目前流通之德國馬克將以一對一之比率收回，而以「薩爾馬克」代替。據消息靈通人士稱，此項措施之目的，乃在爲薩爾區在經濟上與法國合併有所準備，絕不改變薩爾區在法理上之地位。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕此間外交觀察家相信，英國今已準備接受法政府最近建議之薩爾新界，並擬在他日討論德國疆界時予以支持。美政府對此事態度如何，現尚不知，料英政府在確悉美國之態度前，尚不致公然表示同意法國之新要求。</p>
<h3>美國重視沖繩島　將使該島成爲前哨基地</h3>
<p>〔合衆社沖繩島二日電〕（遲到）在沖繩島之美國人，僉認美國關於沖繩島之詳細計劃，應於最近之將來，加以宣佈，以便使美國將該島改建爲西太平洋重要基地計劃，能獲進行。在此間之美人，一致相信美以三萬五千人死傷代價所獲得之沖繩區，將保留於美國佔領之下，但渠等力持，如美國在西太平洋之軍事地位欲加保持，則有從速改建軍事基地之必要。如遠東事件能如計劃進行，美國明年初將與日本簽署和約。該約預料將正式承認美國保有沖繩島，並規定將在日美軍大部分及其器材，包括數百架飛機在內，立即撤退。衆信麥帥及其僚屬將提議大部分美國軍隊，特別是空軍部隊，應撤往沖繩島，該島與關島，今後將被視爲遠東方面之美國重要基地。使沖繩島能具有規模，足供駐紮十萬至二十萬兵力之用，自需要大宗金錢與長期時間，並須從速進行。據此間意見，美軍自日本撤退，在以後十二個月中即將開始，已屬毫無疑問。如此項軍隊撤往沖繩島者，則應供給渠等以永久住　。若干部隊已自菲律濱移來該島，並有更多之部隊，亦可能開往。由於該島多颶風之故，營房建築必須堅固。故此間美人之意見，認爲目前最需要者，乃立即決定該島之政治前途，以及大規模開發該島計劃。此可使沖繩島能與關島并駕齊驅，作爲美國民主政治在西太平洋之前哨云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖十日電〕中國出席聯合國機構副代表夏晋麟，今日率先堅決反對蘇聯所提各大國家供撥同數士兵，軍艦，飛機，以組成世界　備軍之建議。據稱，不可期望中國供撥與美英兩國同數之航空母艦，戰艦及長程轟炸機，法國亦然，況以航空母艦言，蘇聯自身亦成問題云。預料今日午後討論時，英代表　總幹將附和中國，堅持各國必須「比較的」供撥軍力。並將　　立刻建立世界　備軍。</p>

<h3>勃萊頓遺缺　由亞摩繼任</h3>
<p>亞氏係美前駐西大使</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統頃任命亞摩氏爲負責拉丁美洲事務之助理國務卿，以繼辭職之勃萊頓。亞氏於一九三九至一九四四年間曾任美國駐阿根廷大使，一九四四年十二月出任駐西班牙大使，在該國任職一年始返美。渠對拉丁美洲事務，經騐甚爲豐富。自美國政府對拉丁美洲鄰邦之政策進入迅速發展之新階段後，前此已有建議由美國武裝整個西半球，主張對阿根廷貝隆政府採取強硬態度者之勃萊頓助理國務卿之辭職，以及美駐阿根廷大使梅瑟史密斯於完成與阿根廷新政權之接近後，即行退休等步驟，而亞摩之出任助理國務卿，乃其最近之發展。</p>

<h3>蔣夫人參觀善牧會　一羣無吿的女孩子　得到精神上的溫暖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一個孟夏而具有秋意的下午，卻帶予了溫暖的春天給一百三十個孤苦無吿的女孩兒。昨天下午五時，蔣夫人由天主教福利委員會總幹事明德司鐸及本報主筆葉秋原夫婦的陪同，參觀了衡山路底的善收會旣不完全是一所女學校又不是一所孤兒院。這是一所專收孤苦無告的不幸的女孩兒的塲所。那里有未成年的女孩兒，有曾經滄海，墮落風塵的人物。這善牧會在各修女辛苦的支持下，使一部份無告的人，得到了溫暖，早已感動蔣夫人。所以這次蔣夫人雖則為了醫治牙疾來滬，也抽出時間去作了一次參觀。</p>
<p>夫人昨天在醫生的診所間裏出來，便去衡山路參觀這所善牧會。不用說，各修女早已在門口候駕了。善牧會是一個國際的組織，它在上海的會長是美國人，現在美國；此外，還有從美國，加拿大，南美洲，法國及菲列賓來的修女。她們國的彷　是一種「托　尼」的生活，經常在各處求乞來撫養這些無告的人，以無上愉快的心情，歡迎這位貴賓的蒞止。她們唱着歌；夫人以慈母的心情，對於她們作了簡短的訓話，要她們師事耶穌，服務人羣，多作祈禱；又和她們個則作懇切的談話。她們的天真感動了夫人。當修女伴引夫人作各部門的參觀時，連廚房也看到了。夫人對於廚房的整潔，尤特別感到興趣，認為這是修女們教導的有方。</p>
<p>所以當修女們在客堂以茶點款待夫人時，夫人便慷慨地捐助了二十袋米給她們；還答應送糖果及肉類給她們。這僅是物質方面的；夫人能夠在留滬的短促期內去看她們，這纔是給她們的精神上的溫暖。夫人在善收會裏逗留一個鐘頭，纔離開她們；然而這一個鐘頭卻溫暖了一百幾十個人的心。</p>
<h3>工人生活　理應改善　對恢復抗戰前底薪　總工會認為無理由　反對統一指數折扣辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市總工會歷史長水祥雲，昨對本報記者談話：認為自生活指數解凍後，各工業同業公會與公業協會到處請願，要求恢復民國二十五年工資作為底數及照上一個月指數發給本月份薪金二點，均無理由。蓋民國二十五年時，工人昌僅二三角錢一天，所過均為非人生活，抗戰勝利後之今日，豈不容許工人生活稍微改善？照上月指數給薪一點，更屬違反中央意旨。且解凍辦法中規定工廠眞有虧損時，勞資得自行洽商，將指數再打折扣。工人對此並未表示反對，因工人對自己廠中盈虧情形最為清楚，絕不願自己工廠虧蝕閉歇，而使本身陷於失業。水氏稱：日前在京訪晤社會部谷部長，昨日會晤經濟部陳部長，兩部長皆表示中央決不變更巳定政策，各工廠如有困難，儘可以個別協議。水氏復強調稱：總工會絕對反對各工業統一指數折扣辦法。並謂：目前工業不能振興之原因甚多，工業界應從大處着眼，請求政府解決困難，如原料進口，解除外貨傾銷，工商貸款等等，不必在工資上斤斤計較云。</p>

<p>南市魯班路九昌織綢廠一百餘職工，要求五月份工資依照指數二萬三千五百倍發給，廠房祗允依一萬四千八百倍發，工人於前日起開始絕食，社會局正派員調解中。梵皇渡路強華染織廠工人要求將工資調整為底薪制依生活指數發給不遂，又因五月份之工資及六月份之飯金廠方至今未見發下，工人乃於前日亦開始絕食。三區絲織業公會於昨日推派代表至總工會陳述經過。</p>

<h3>維護業餘體育　國際業餘體協大會　否決變更業餘規則</h3>

<p>裁判吳伯鈺，經核對出場球員學籍證後，擇地開賽，大夏先行開球，且佔順風之利，奈球藝相差殊遠，第一局前半約翰以十一比八佔先，易地後，約翰得風力之助，益見兇猛，終以廿一比十二結束，大夏失去首局。</p>

<h3>紗布輸往漢口　申請審核簡則　經部暫予撤銷　弱運紗布廠商登記今截止</h3>

<p>又該會辦理紗布北運核准廠商登記事宜。迄昨日　，已有廠商三百餘家，前往領取登記卡。今為領取登記卡最後之一日，昨起該會則將以限額分別通知各廠商云</p>
<p>〔又訊〕華南河北及東北各。岸紗布轉運，仍照原定辦法理云。</p>
<h3>紗銷動　棉布閒散</h3>
<p>昨棉紗市况，以銀根稍鬢，本街買戶見低吸收，粵漢兩帮相繼進取，喊價先平後升。四二支藍　由一千二百十萬盤高至四十萬元，比上日回升二十萬元。廿支特雙馬亦高至八百四十五萬元，軋漲十五萬元。雙馬紗亦好二十萬元。其餘十六支十支卅二支等粗細紗市亦均趨秀</p>
<p>昨日棉布市氣閑散，聞客地價格仍係倒懸，客帮納意懈怠，塲中散戶拋售。更逢紡建公司供售，籌碼充沛，致十二磅細布喊價高後即低，結果五福振中王龍等牌上升二千至五千元，陽鶴及無牌下挫一二千元，全日市勢惟漂布及跳鯉元光斜，本街與製傘廠微有添辦，價好二三千元至二萬元不一。元布及藍布市盤趨鬆，士林布站定。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售布一七九九〇疋，被單五〇條。此中廠商申請共七戶，布九六〇疋。布號甲請單五〇五張，布一七〇三〇疋，被單五〇條。</p>
<h3>人絲行情堅穩　廠經綢貨交易少</h3>
<p>昨巿人造絲上午行情堅穩，一二〇號旭字有光一千八百萬元開盤後，屹然未動，最大曾喊過八百二十萬元。下午因各方喊賣聲多，且股市報小，故人心更虛，遂致不支下降，一度在八九十萬元間盤旋。最後卒以八百六十萬元收盤，較上日計短四十萬元。東洋等貨均隨之同吿挫落，七五號金鷄半光仍喊二千五百萬元，不過乏人過問。</p>
<p>昨市廠經交易甚稀，實銷方面去胃甚微，故喊價日趨軟弱，高勻度五担頭昨日未聞做開，只有高級另担有六七包成交，B級貨價做二千四百五十萬元，C字貨二十萬元，D級貨四百萬元，干經另担，亦有一二包交易，價做一千七百五十萬元。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨因原料價疲而呈下降，美亞被面喊九百四十萬元未成交。華强被面喊八百九十萬元賣出，還價八十萬元未成交。大誠格子　縐聞巿做三萬四千二百元，中途一百元有成交，最後做聞四千元，隔日期喊四千三百元賣出價，盛貨電力紡等均小去一二萬元。冲電力紡高檔廿九萬元，次者廿十萬元，入絲華錦縐一萬六千五百元係高檔貨，人絲羽紗一萬六千元稍有交易，因市上現貨甚缺，故尙能維特上日原盤。</p>
<h3>採取樣繭　訂定辦法</h3>
<p>農經兩部蠶絲產銷協導委員會，鑒於近日各地收繭已成尾聲，明日即可全部辦理結束，其第二部手續則為採取樣繭問題，業經訂定辦法，遵照辦理。</p>
<h3>統債外股平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨統丙晨開七八〇〇元，自七四〇〇元盤高至八一〇〇元，最後在前收價左右盤旋。散戶先進後出，四〇八室稍納，成交不下六百萬元。結果較前收計甲乙戊各升二百元，統丙平平，丁種漲三百元。</p>
<p>外股昨過程平穩，怡紗晨開五四〇〇〇元，高價達六〇〇〇〇元，後以港申電報升至十五元一，漸趨平和，證券帶稍納，洋行帶收進，廣帮仍吸航業而出怡紗。結果與前收相較，計鋼業微降，會德豐漲半成，怡紗英聯航業業展微升。</p>
<h3>市塲傳說紛紜　華股跌多於漲</h3>
<p>華股昨中途雖有回漲，但以人心脆弱，臨收仍形不支。消息紛紜，屍幻莫測，價高時有助買流言，疲落時又傳利空消息，以致過程十分飄忽，乍升乍降。不易捉摸，交易依然不多，結果則跌多於漲。　晨開時以報載中美貸款呼解又高，而隔前國行差進甚巨，人心不板，僅有少數有開盤成交。遞永紗開低較多，開後六三號八五號七三號一二三號一四三號二二三號一一七號復　到五三三〇元，即交永紗則止於五三二〇元低價。二三一號九一號六〇號二三五號二一一號八九號二三四號一五五號一六號趁低進至五六八〇元。一五二號一八六號一六〇號二〇六號一四八號賣出，又退至五四五〇元。經一五二號二二三號一二號之補進，而升至五六五〇元，三六號一〇五號一四一號七六號一三四號一一七號尙來了結。遞永紗再跌至五四〇〇元內，一〇四號九七號一一二號一五七號一三四號三二號八三號二三二號六五號二二四號均進，二三一號一〇四號並進現永紗。</p>
<p>十一時十分，傳某派翻多，及美券證金有通融可能之訊，遞永紗回升至五八二〇元，二〇三號二三六號一五四號一五三號一五五號七六號二一八號　到五六〇〇元內，二二三號一六號趁低來進，近午再吿盤上，曾　度漲到五七八〇元。一〇六號七六號一五七號一四二號六八號一三一號等　袂了結，臨收時浮多急於了結，於是又有貸款方案，日內即可備得協議之說，遞永紗步降至五五〇〇元光景，而後稍定。　收後遞永紗喊低至五四五〇元以下，結果較前收計信和永公漲半成强，新光微升。永紗　　景福勤興中法新　微降，火柴亦然。中絲中紡統益平平，新亞榮豐商務麗安微升，內衣景綸五和跌半成强。遞交各股計勤興平平，永公微升，永紗信和微降，華豐新光景福各跌半成弱，場外各老股榮辱俱微。</p>
<p>又訊二美亞綢廠增資後之新服，定本月十二日（星期四）起，恢復賣買，以一萬股為成交單位。</p>
<h3>食米店胃仍呆　市勢南疲北堅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市因受風雨影響，各蒂貨船被阻於途，故昨日到貨略稀。計南市登記四〇一〇石，北市一六二五石，市上進出散戶較多，銷路平庸，店胃仍呆。市勢南疲北堅，高白粳南市做四十萬元，北市三十八萬五千元。薄稻南市三十九萬五千元，北市四十萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：米市近因黃梅時間熟性之期，去化呆滯，內地步降，消化不振，勢難生色。主要原困為四川開縈，漢口難糧東運，江西不日開放，皖米來申貨湧，至米價直接函跌者，銀根緊迫，亦不無關係。</p>
<p>油市以新案子登場，四鄕食油消化見减，靑鳥營口續有到源，漸漸下降，麫粉雖然大跌，但廠方目光，新麫粉將來十萬必須進關，故小麥麫紛再　下游。且蘇北運輸已通，江北產麥亦為蘇省大宗，日後來貨必湧，故對於民食無虞，洋米尙不在預算之中。</p>
<h3>大批洋秈　裝運來滬</h3>
<p>招商局海辰輪，已難仰光載運中信局訂購之秈米七千餘噸來滬，約二十日可抵埠。又該局本月底將派遣海玄綸由滬直放仰光，裝運中信局秈米九千餘噸來滬。</p>
<h3>出口包裝材料　可以准許進口　不許流入市塲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會第十三次例會，於昨日上午十時舉行。到陳光甫，劉攻芸，伍嗣達，陳雋人，慮作孚（童少生代），列席馬格，白益恩等，由陳光甫主席，討論通過要案二起，尙待呈准全國經委會後施行。茲探誌兩案如次：（一）通過太會秘書處組織規程及預算案。（二）通過出口貨所需包裝材料之特許進口辦法。聞該項包裝材料，不屬輸管會限額分配之列。惟規定出口商申請准許進口前，須保證不使該項材料流入市場，作為商品買賣。聞該案係馬格所提出。</p>
<h3>自備外匯輸入羊毛　輸管會將予通融　但以四月十七日前申請者為限</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：輸管會限額分配處日前主持人選更動，內部工作，一切仍照常，亦無其他人事更動。聞該處一二兩季所發表之各項限額，均感不敷需用，惟其中尤以羊毛，紙類，本　，橡膠等限額，不敷程度更甚。該處現對羊毛進口商之自備外匯，而業於本年四月十七日前，申請准許輸入羊毛者，正設法使之通融進口。惟該日以後之由請，因格於當局規定，則無法辦理。橡膠限額之分配間題，昨日該處曾召開橡膠廠商諮詢小組會，洽談一過，結果廠商方面，仍未能自行核定配額，議請該處參照第一季限額分配情形分配之。按第一季橡膠限額，為美金一百十萬元，分一配結果，原料七十萬元，車胎三十萬元，廢橡膠及其他橡膠製品各五萬元。至第二季限額，已增為美金二百萬元云。</p>

<h3>鐵牛犂土　曳引機半小時耕完兩畝田　平土機有禆於新農村建設</h3>
<p>— 杭州七日快訊　本報持派員儱裕生　到餘杭去</p>
<p>兩個月以前，行總浙江分署從總署赛潑來了曳引机與平士機，兩個月以後，這曳引机已在統屬餘杭縣荒蕪了的土地上開始工作，引動了浙江各方人士的興輕。前台遵行政長官壩儀，浙省政府主席沈鴻烈·浙江大學·之江大學，青年會會員，新聞同業都曾去參觀過。他們一致對這科學的　業的機械表示識佩，記者承浙江分署署長孫曉機氏之邀，在烈日當空的初夏天氣，向餘杭的路上前去。餘杭，是杭州的鄰縣，我曾去過兩次，一次是在戰時，正是準備迎敵。一次是在卅五年七月，正是在復員的途程中，那時，去餘杭路上，滿眼荒蕪，一堆堆的斷垣殘壁，顯得凄凉殘敗。原先的系林萬頃，變成了夢軍沒脛。這一次，是在勝利後的第二年，沿途，還看不出有復蘇的氣象。沒有增添一幢新的房屋，沒有看見新墾的一大片的土地。</p>
<p>將到餘杭，車子停在公路旁邊，那裏有兩所流動金屋，用籬笆隔成了一方院洛，門口掛着兩塊招脾：一塊是浙江分署的曳引機駕駛修理訓練班，一塊是餘杭縣的集體農塲。首先，參觀了流動金屋的設備，其次再看曳引機與平土機。所謂曳引機（原名Tractor）。是用引擎拖帶使用各種農具的機器，它的本身是一個汽車頭，背後可以掛帶犁刀犁土，鐵扒扒土，鐮刀割實。這個機器是福特廠出品，是弗格森（Ferguson）所製造的。像這種機器，遠在第一次世界大戰後美國已經使用了。第一次大戰後，美國把這種機器輸到蘇聯，蘇聯根據這種機器使用後的缺點，加以硏究改良，再由美國研究改良，始成為現在這種樣式。本來這稱機器在犂土的時候，如果碰見一塊大石頭，犂不動，車子就頭輕尾重、會翻轉過來，甚至把駕駛的人壓死，規在好了，他發明了一種機構，在駕駛的人坐位右邊，置着兩顆鐵鈕，只消用兩指一接，這重達數百磅的犂刀就撓起來，不致爲巨石所絆倒了。在機器的後面，可以拖掛兩柄犂刀</p>
<p>工作新姿</p>
<p>我們參觀時，運來的十架曳引機都在荒蕪的地土上工作，有的在機後僅掛一把犂刀，一個掛刀的長鐵條撓了起來，好像牛的尾巴，所以一般農民都稱之爲鐵牛。鐵牛犂土很深，足有一尺多深入土內，翻過來後還可以把它扒鬆，然後播種施肥。這種機器不能挿秧，因爲挿秧的時候田裏有水，不能行動。但如果在灌水以前還沒有挿秧的時候，這些鍼牛却可以盡到翻耕的責任。收穫的時候，田裏乾了，這些鐵牛也可以盡到收割的責任。這鐵牛在民十七年由浙大農學院購來兩架使用過，因爲修理上發生困難，使用不得其法，就此擱着不用了。現在「鐵牛」的一切修理機件俱備，並且還有打鐵的設備，這個打鐵設備也是從美國來的，是用手搖動一鐵風爐，風即呼呼而出，不必像中國樣的用勁抽風箱了。同時打鐵時的錘頭，也可以因爲你需要的農具而各異，不必像中國樣的老是用一二種錘頭了。</p>
<p>另外一種是平土機，（原名Bulldoger）是專門用爲壓平和潮平泥土用的對於耕地上使用的機會比較少，而對於建設新的農村底用處就大了，這種平土機在修築道路的時候也是適用的。</p>
<p>鼓勵採用</p>
<p>我尋問農胞，　於曳引機使用的興趣，有一位說：「這隻鐵牛眞好極了，半個鐘點就可以耕好兩畝出。」我再問離流動金屋不遠正在舉鋤工作的一個農胞覺得這種耕地法有否缺點，他嘆息着說：「這種耕地好是好了，但我還是自已用手耕懇的，因爲機器墾耕的土地，據說鄉公所要還糧，花好二斗一畝，花壞一斗一畝算來，還不如用人工　耕比較合算。像這樣兩畝土地，要二十工，每工三升米，每升米市價三千五百元，要二十一萬元，但因爲是懇荒，三年內可以不必還租。」</p>
<p>由此，我們却找到了中國農業不進步的　結，我們以農立國，於今數千年，衝遭是用着人與牛力，絕不想用機器，也不硏究機器，甚至不歡迎機器，這個原因就是因爲我們的蕪層政治不曉得如何去推進它，反而去戕害它！我們中國的一些農具與製造農具的方法原理，原和近代的西洋進步農具沒有什麽兩樣，所差者就是沒有進一步的硏究，誰不讓他們硏究，誰阻止了新的方法輸入農村，這就該由基層政治負責了。像餘杭那樣的機器耕犁的方法，我們正該如何鼓勵農胞們使用啊！怎可徵收額外的糧款呢？並且行總又不要地方政府一個錢的。</p>
<p>集體農場</p>
<p>有一位同去的行總高級職員說：「我們到餘杭，縣政府召開了一個會，我們問鄉下有沒有合作社之類的組織，那裏曉得合作社不在鄉下，我們勢望他們組織集體農塲，但把荒了的土地，東一塊西一塊的零碎支配着，使工作上感着很不順利。」合作社是要深入農村的，我們知道餘杭一定有合作社的組織爲怎麽合作社反而生產不出來了呢？</p>
<p>人才訓練</p>
<p>行總訴分舉現在正加緊訓練使用興修理曳引機的人才。這裏受訓的有十個人，都是大學程度，有四個是浙大農院畢業的，三個是英大畢業的，一個是金　實騐農業職業學校園林科畢業的，還有兩位是浙大沒有畢業的，他們管理這機械，僅供　宿，沒有待遇，過着鄉村艱苦的生活。在這世風漸下人們歡喜享樂時候，他們以一種創造的精神深入農村，實在値得憨佩的，我們看到他們辛勤的工作，在荒蕪了的土地上開墾，覺得欣喜愉快，沈得在前途茫茫灰色一片的時候，顯現着一絲曙光，因爲他們緊荒了一千多畝土地了。</p>
<h3>從僑匯上看　閩僑在海外經濟動態</h3>
<p>— 福州七日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>陽光照耀之處，皆有華僑足跡，外國人常以這句話極譽中國，國人也賞以此自豪。可是，海外僑胞究竟有多少，因中國是一個不着統計的國家，一向就缺乏精確的數目。記者在此間養以此微詢臨國的僑領或翻關有關僑　的資料書籍，所得比較可靠的統計，包括南洋各地，歐，美，非，澳，日，韓，準全部僑胞有一千三萬餘、人（其中南洋各地僑胞佔七百四十餘萬人）福建籍佔總數三分之一。於此可見閩僑在華僑中之地位。</p>
<p>福建這個地方，因為地理構造狀態的特異，有過一長時期和中原隔絕着，而倾向於海外的關係，構成中國海洋商業文化系統一環。閩僑移　海外，始於秦漢，盛於唐宋，最先到达的地方即是荒蕪未開墾的南洋，南洋人稱華僑為唐人，紐約有唐人街，這些都是當時盛大移民的遺跡。到了明初，三保太監鄭和下南洋，傳說當時閩人隨其南移的很多，一時蔚爲風氣。當時廣州與泉州已闢爲商埠，與諸番互市，帆船如織，有定期之南洋班船。經過了數世紀努力的結果，閩僑在南洋開拓了廣大的生存空間，掌握雄厚的經濟勢力，每年鹿大數月的僑匯，無異給國庫增加了不少國際收入。</p>
<p>閩僑下南洋　經濟原因居多</p>
<p>福建境內山嶺盤結，平原地域僅佔全省面積百分之五—十，日耕地不及三千市畝。像養着一千三百餘萬的人口，「去之者衆，食之者寡」，每年米糧大量入口，因此，福建人口因耕地短少而顯得相對的過剩，經濟原因迫使閩胞「帶了一個水產，一身衣服，一襲草蓆，一把扁担」之外別無長物遠涉南洋，十九世紀有名的沙勞越新福州（原名詩誣）開墾運動，就是福州人前往開闢的，新加坡通柔佛的鐵橋也是閩僑胼手胝足建立起來的。閩僑對南洋的繁榮有過不朽的業績。</p>
<p>遠渡重洋，萬里迢迢的航程，必須要勇敢體强的人才能支持，所以，到南洋去的大半是壯年漢，通嘗在十六歲至三十五歲之間，閩僑中以海澄，漳州，泉州，同安，南安，惠安，厦門，霜淸，古田各縣爲多，晋江之石獅，南安之詩山，海澄之丘楊則爲最大之僑鄉。</p>
<p>閩僑職業　工商金融為主</p>
<p>閩僑在南洋奮門的「社會階梯」，一般的都是由雇工，走販，夥計，小店主而至大商人，他們以勞力作資本，作事勤講，行爲端正勝人所不能任，逐漸滲透入南洋各行業的活動，經過長期含茹如苦的生活，奠定了他們的經濟基礎。南洋各地三百餘萬閩橋所經營的業務以工商金融爲主，惟亦因地而畢。大槪英屬馬來亞以經營樹膠，錫，椰子，黃梨，金融，土產貿易爲主，其中新加坡精製之紋膠在南洋享有盛譽，經營此業者幾全爲閩省永春人。此外，椰油與錫幾乎都是爲閔僑所經營，霸佔了南洋市塲。荷屬東印度閩僑以營石汕，樹膠，茶，糖，咖啡，錫，椰油爲主，爪哇以製精爲多，蘇門答臘則漁農並重，荷印已故之糠大王黃仲涵氏即爲閩人。法屬安南閩僑以從事碾米，藥材，棉業，樹膠園爲主，閩僑在安南雖爲數無多，然在商業中很佔地位。還　以米，錫，樹膠爲主。菲律賓的閩僑大半是業零售商，以米，木材及化裝品爲主。一個外國人的估計全菲四分之三的商業信用是操在閩僑手上，在一九三三年，他們在菲律賓的投費總額即達一萬萬英元之鉅。閩僑在南洋所營的企業。著者如僅嘉庚的樹膠廠，胡文虎的永安堂，黃奕住的酒精廠，其次的企業組織機則不勝枚舉，閩僑實是佔據了南洋的「經濟寳座」。</p>
<p>龐大僑匯　增強外匯準備</p>
<p>通常國際投資，必先有一項「資本支出」，而後始有「企業利潤收入」可言。而華僑在海外建立的企業投資，其資本是勞力的累積，對於祖國實際並沒有支出，反而付鉅額的國際收入，僑匯對於國家經濟的作用，實在比獎勵掛口意義還天，因爲前者只是勞力的付出。戰前，每年僑匯的數目相當龐大，對彌補祖國入超的貢獻，有不可　滅的功續。根據民國廿三年比較可靠的統計，包括任何方式之僑機及僑胞親自携帶回國之財物（損款在內）每年達二十萬萬之鉅（官方或團家銀行的僑匯僅能佔及上述十分之一）。以比數字看，可知閩僑在海外所擁有的經濟地位。</p>
<p>太平洋戰起，僑匯乃吿斷絕，閩僑在南的經濟力量受到很大的約屬。</p>
<p>勝利初期。閩僑因復員伊始及格於僑居地政府對於匯款嚴格的限制，僑匯仍未暢旺，迄至去年四月，閩僑始逐漸與家鄉親屬取得聯絡，僑匯於焉恢復，綜合閩省省僑務處與閩省郵政管理局的統計，自去年四月到去年底止，閩省所收之僑匯總數在八十億以上，除郵管局經匯卅五億外，以廈門中興銀行所縣匯的數額爲多，今年一至二月根據中國銀行的報吿，經收僑機約十二億。據僑界人士估計，經過國家行局的僑匯僅佔實際僑匯十之一二，僑匯大多數是經過民信局劃匯，蓋該局匯費低於國家行局殊多，如加上大批僑胞回國親自帶同之各種有價證劵與財物，則可知勝利以來之僑匯，數目仍然組當可觀。閩南的僑民且流行着一種迷信，每寄一封家書，都得附寄若千款子，否則便認爲不吉利，似此零星的僑匯尤其無法估計。</p>
<p>運用僑資　原創造新環增多</p>
<p>華僑在此次戰爭中所受的敎訓至深，加上土著民族的排華，使華僑改變了「黃金南洋」的觀念，自勝利以還，據此間僑務機關的統計，歸國閩僑數在五萬人以上，出國者綜計不及一萬五千人，於此可見閩僑對祖國已逐漸增强其向心力，這是吸收僑資的良好機會，閩僑資本之流回福　，對於閩省鉅額入超現狀之改善與地方社會經濟之繁華具有決定之作用。低是，僑資之內流必須造成運用僑資可能性之環境，否則，僑資即使內流也未必有助於地方建設，如閩南比較富庶的僑鄉因大最的資金無所洩。近來盛行迎神養會動亂　農千百萬金，爭奇門富，無稍吝色，或則以資金移作高利貸，加重了農村的危機。而對於企業的投資，則絕少興趣。這次以胡交虎爲首的閩僑組設福建經濟建公司，察其情勢，尙歪能邀得各地僑胞的熱烈輕應，因此，募股的進度迂緩，據記者與此間僑領接觸的結果，似乎閩僑回國投資感到政府不能提供有利的條件而有所顧慮，如經濟目標不確定，交通條件不具備，缺乏適當的保障與便利等等。</p>
<p>作爲中國革命之母的華僑具有優良的革命傳統，如黃花崗七十二烈士中福建志士大半是僑居南洋的，他們愛祖國比國內人來得切，他們的財力也的確比國內人强，抗戰時期，華僑在人力與財力上踴躍輸將，給抗戰助力很大，今後建國的事業，同樣的不能缺少這股雄厚的經濟力量。</p>
<h3>滇南十日　箇舊錫業展望</h3>
<p>— 昆明二日航訊　本報特派員　徐繼濂</p>
<p>我國產錫區。首搜南舊箇，餘如廣西富川賀縣，河池。南丹，　白，湖南之江華。臨武，宜單，柳縣，常寗，桂陽，江西之大便，南康，贛縣，廣東之電白，揭陽，及海南島，新疆之庫庫車舊井附近等處雖各有產量，但均不及簡舊遠甚。</p>
<p>來源為花崗岩　位於高原頂部</p>
<p>被稱寫中國錫都的箇舊，開化甚選，元代以前的歷史已無從稽考，它位於　省南部，鎭越鐵路之西，拔海一千八百公尺，除產錫而外，他如生活必需品及廠區所用之材料，無不　給於外地，因有「燒柴不見樹，吃米不見糠」之　。正以其如此，箇舊乃形成爲五方雜處之地，人人唯利是岡，所謂「偏重銀錢　土，不聞恭儉溫良」，正可以作爲最好的寫照。</p>
<p>摘舊錫　的發源可以分爲三大支：第一支源於建水所屬之判山，蜿蜒南下至箇舊之老陽山，綿互數百里，直至紅河江岸爲止。第二支由乍甸連結向東來，以至簡舊老陰山止。第三花源出藏自麒麟山一帶，結瓦房冲，破山椿，松樹脚及古山等廠區，面積百餘方里。</p>
<p>關於錫脈分佈情形，也有專家曾經作過調査，謂箇舊錫質來源爲花崗岩，多位於高原之頂部，礦區附近多爲石灰岩分佈之區，主要礦區則多在高原之東部，以老廠·馬拉格及瓦房冲三區經藏最富，老廠面積最廣，可分為黃茅山，耗子廟，漱子街，花扎口，銀峒及老銀廠六小區。</p>
<p>雲南錫鑛開採　始於元明兩代</p>
<p>雲南錫礦開採的歷史，從來便沒有詳確的記載，不過滇錫的發現，大槪逮在漢朝，元明兩代或有開採，至淸季中葉，錫價上漲，及光緒廿三年年滇越鐵路通車後，廠情乃得日趨旺盛。洎乎民國以來，辦廠者風起雲湧。廠務愈形發達。</p>
<p>惜乎好景不常，箇舊的興旺沒有持續了長遠的時候，首先是戰爭的迫害，使得工作和生產大大地打了一個折扣，而交通上的阻塞，更使得運銷和出口方面有了問題，比方外來的器材和機械，便無法進入到這一個區域裏來，天天在喊着運用新法，可是科學的生產方法不能離開機器的使用，笨重的東西遷不來，再說外匯的申請輾凍需時，是生產方面所必要的器材，每每買不到手，如此而能求得生產方法的改良，殆爲一件天大的難事！</p>
<p>三年復興計劃　環境阻撓太多</p>
<p>雲南錫業公司也曾擬訂過三年復興計劃，設計是非常週到的，但實行上的困難可又有多少？公司方面願意儘量使用機器，而且願多多與廠商合作，以朮整個錫業的復興，只是事實上有許多想不到的阻撓，使得他們前信心大大地打了折扣，而且由於廠商的猜忌與嫉妒心理，更使得計劃不能原利地實行，錫業公司在三年計劃中，預備加設箇舊至老廠畏達十公里的空中索道。因爲如此才眞能做到省時省力的地步，每日可以運送礦砂五百至一千噸，其次須使小龍遷發電所趕快成立，跟着洗鍊的問題便解決了，最後便是　錫廠煆冶砂礦的加強計劃，務期能達到日練三百到五百　止的。</p>
<p>計劃若果不能實行。常常會成爲嚴空泛的盧文，箇舊錫業復興計劃，便不幸遇上了這份境地，一直到現在，還未能實現計劃中的一小部份，主其事者需頭歏息說：「環境如此，困難重重，又能有什麼好辦法能打開目前的僵局？」說也當真，個人的力量是多麽渺小！</p>
<p>我們也曾說過：箇舊除了錫而外，是個什麽也不能生產的地方，正惟其如此，箇舊的錫業如果不能復興，則不止影響到閩南人民的生計，整個雲南何嘗又不是一個鉅大的損失？範圍再擴大一點，在中國的出口貿易說來，也未始不無影響，因此，許多人都關心到商舊錫業的前途。</p>
<p>一席座談會議　討論箇錫前途</p>
<p>承錫業州公司對我們這記者參觀團的重視，他們特別邀集了當地有關人士，舉行了一個很有意義的座談會，大家都提供了許多意見，對箇錫前途，每個人都寄予了熱忱的希望。縣參議會議長黃元直，是個精明强幹的老年人，他提起了嗓子，指陳了當前箇舊錫業的危機，當然，金屬礰的開採，沒有大量的資本是無濟於事的，而目前箇舊錫礦開採的根本問題正是缺乏資本，以此他們向四聯總處呼籲，從速舉辦錫貸，千呼萬喚只是批准了一十五億元，這在箇舊錫商們看來。一個有限的數目，而且還分期借發，似乎是杯水車薪，遠水也救不了近火，黃議長大聲疾呼，需要大最的貨款？呂協理更具體地說：政府能夠低利貨放，且能繼續貸款三年，則以後年產一萬噸大錫可無問題，現正請求貨款數增爲一百五十億元，這次貸款之能否成功，也即是中國錫業能否復興·以及將來能否在世界市塲上取得一席地位之一大重要關鍵。</p>

<p>西安的西南郊灃河沿岸，在古代是非常繁榮的，久居長安的人，提起「八水繞城」，及周代文王的靈台，幾乎是盡人皆知。據說在周秦年代，這河流都是近郊漕運，不知在這河邊，演出過多少舊事。後來那些工程漸漸的又煙沒了，當年的黎華舊夢，變成了亢旱的悲哀，祖先的勝事，只成了美麗的回憶。但是現在却已改變了，舊的河渠上建起了新工程。</p>
<p>關中八惠之一</p>
<p>灃惠渠由秦渡鎭起，向東北流，經過了六年的修築，費去了四一六·八〇三·六八九·八四元的鉅款，它使本市西北郊的農田二十三萬畝，變成了水田。它有一座砌石流水大壩，長達一三三·二七公尺，高及二·一公尺，有兩座大小閥，共計七斗，這工程和渭惠等渠比起，也許幷不算偉大，但是它是在抗戰期中開始修築的，民國三十年九月，正是國遝艱難，民生困苦，敵我隔河對峙，獄至緊張，在這種情况下，展開巨工，這種精神，令人即慕，値得讚美。當時物價昇漲甚烈，正如今日，灃裏渠的黃用全係農行貨款，因手續繁複，預算常常不數。到三十三年貸款曾一度停止，後經迭次電請中央，卒底於成。使這秦漢舊　的居民再慶豐收，昆明太乙池畔再見流水。灃惠渠原是李儀社先生計劃的「關中八惠」之一，原來以爲二年內即可吿成，誰知因抗戰關係，延到近六年左右。灃惠渠的工程和中國抗戰時期的苦難相同，它的建築是中國新生紀念碑之一。</p>
<p>水車井將失效</p>
<p>記者上月間曾前往參觀灃惠渠放水典禮，只見剪彩之後，水閘上升了，激流從閘下奔騰而出，水花迸濺，軍樂徐徐奏起了，鞭砲炸開了，農民笑了，燃烈的黨聲拍起來。無數的紙花，大把的玫塊從台上扔到水中，紅花淸水，美麗極了。鄉民自動請的「大戲」，也開了鑼，一個老百姓吿訴記者說：「假若今年年成好，會更熱閙，雛知莊稼今年聘（壞）列！」接着他又吿訴記者，田禾壞了「官款」太重，日子怎過呀……等。他們在等待救濟。記進問他對水渠的觀感，他說：「我在大劉村，河西呢，吃不上利，今日這是「光」熱鬧里！」今年鄉間的災荒、確是値得注意。</p>
<p>走在古遍上，曾欣賞過許多水車井。一個朋友說：「這些再遲三四年全部失去效用了！」車上的人們默然同意；記者默默地親像着，在三四年後，這裏繁榮到什麽樣子。</p>

<h3>讀譚延闓詩集</h3>
<p>— 蕭藻</p>
<p>我很愛譚延關先生的詩，因爲他的詩富有唐大的風味，和學宋詩的一派尖新生硬的氣象，廻然不同。</p>
<p>他有一首桔桿詩：</p>
<p>「隨人俯仰非無謂，贏淸得泉滿漢陰：</p>
<p>園叟不知灌漑力，漫疑機事有機心。」</p>
<p>這的確有一種雍容的風度。灌漑力，是一切力量的主要機體，桔桿雖有「機事」。但絕對沒有「機心」。今日國事的所以不能滿人意處，首先要怪有機心的人在作崇，桔桿之所以龍「贏得淸泉滿漢陰」者，便在他雖有機事而無機心。譚先生是只注意於灌溉力的，水到渠成，自然而不爲害，我佩服他的雍容雅度，但這是那些國叟們所不能瞭解的。</p>
<p>這首詩句法，其實也有所本。葉少蘊「石林詩話」云：「舊中書南廳壁間，有晏元獻題詠上竿妓一詩：「百尺竿頭嬝嬝身，足騰跟掛駭旁人。漢陰有叟君知否！抱麥區區亦未貧」。當時固必有謂文潞公在樞府，嘗一日遇中書，與荆公行至題下，持遲留誦詩久之，亦未能無意也。荆公他日復題一篇於詩後云：「賜也能言未識眞，誤將心許漢陰人。桔桿俯仰何妨至，抱幾區區老此身。」</p>
<p>這二首和譚公的詩，同用一個典故，句法也有些類似，但題材和意境各有不同。元獻，荆公，和譚公的身分，是一般的，但氣象各殊，我倒寗喜譚公的這一首「桔桿」，而有「靑出於藍」之感。</p>
<p>集中詩有關係史事最巨者，如。</p>
<p>「戲贈俄羅斯人歸國。</p>
<p>別時常比會時多，異地相逢一瞬過。</p>
<p>惟有當頭南海月，送君直到莫斯科。」</p>
<p>這是指的當時鮑羅廷諸人而言，此心「明明如月」，譚公固不禁「憂從中來」耳。</p>
<p>又「推鋒」一律云：</p>
<p>「推鋒直進嗟何益，密計周防智已　。</p>
<p>載鬼弧眞張復脫，汚人塵起更無端。</p>
<p>瞻烏未識飛誰止，困獸方知鬥亦難。</p>
<p>莫謂浮雲能暫蔽，肯將明月事輕彈。」</p>
<p>這首律詩更明顯地對於當時局面發生的一種慨歎，稍稍明瞭當時政局的人，是不難索解的，我知這些詩作，必定是將來極珍貴的史料。</p>
<p>北伐成功之後，譚公所作，頗露欣慰之情者，如「端午口占」云：</p>
<p>「幾手嶺外過端午，誰料江天對舉觴：</p>
<p>碌碌因人有今日，遲遲中道</p>
<p>感周行。</p>
<p>一身多役忘家食，萬骨成功弔國觴：</p>
<p>佳節不愗鞦事少，捷書行報入遼陽。」</p>
<p>譚公假如尙在，眼見今日東北的戰事，不知尚能留得這一分歡情否？</p>
<p>又如「己已元日」云：</p>
<p>老來重見太平春，家國雍熙又此辰：</p>
<p>海內早知同樂歲，天涯無復未歸人。</p>
<p>含飴正喜親加膝，止酒無傷漸入層：</p>
<p>多少兒時梨棗事，不妨團坐說年新。」</p>
<p>從這裏可以見到他晚年家庭中的樂趣。但這是指小輩而言，他的夫人却先死了的，每年三月三日及七月望日，必有悼亡之作，語摯情眞，亦非尋常詩人所可及。錄其中數首，以見一斑。</p>
<p>「月滿秋淸似往年，又看兒女拜樽前；</p>
<p>魂歸冥漢君知否？老去心情轉濯然。</p>
<p>隙影已嗟來日少，風花猶是昔時妍；</p>
<p>轉輪萬刧終相見，何用微塵戀一天。」</p>
<p>「房權猶是當時舊，事往人亡劇可哀；</p>
<p>閔默自傷年荏苒，殷勤還記影徘徊。</p>
<p>明燈笑語情如昨，寒雨凄冷夢不來；</p>
<p>歸旋今齊訴湘水，知余歌枕懷城限。」</p>
<p>「高樓月上正相望，老去心情獨自傷：</p>
<p>久病不辭泉路近，初秋才覺萬衣凉。</p>
<p>也知齊奠空多事，省識人天共一光：</p>
<p>妄念刻除今已盡，此身何必判存亡。」</p>
<p>這較之悼亡詩最有名的元　（微之）數律，亦略無愧色，元　有「今日俸錢過十萬，與君營奠且營實」等傖俗不堪之語，猶不及「也知齋奠空多事，省識人天共一光」的超脫。譚公自奔走革命以後，不甚顧家，悼亡後獨居以迄於歿，故有「妄念　除」之句，這比諸同僚中晚年多置妾腰的，是大有逕庭了。</p>
<p>他的詩淡雅眞實，出於至情，眞如近人丁叔雅所云：「爲有眞情工慨歎，删除綺語變風騷，」讀之可以看人伉　之　。</p>
<p>譯公是道地的儒家，以「親親而仁民」爲無上的信條，試再讀他的「與中口占」云：</p>
<p>「多少蒼生淚欲傾，路人猶自說歡迎：</p>
<p>傷心掩耳南安道，怕聽窮擔爆竹聲。」</p>
<p>這「怕窮爆竹聲」的心情，是痛苦的，可惜只知逢迎他的地方官吏不能瞭解。</p>
<p>本文因範輻關係，只能略引其近體、長　古風，不克一一評述。</p>
<h3>詩瑣談</h3>
<p>— 鏗鏘</p>
<p>詩是實騐室裏的酒精燈，人的生活是放在試管裏的　片，藉着詩的熱力，人的生活可以像碘片一樣的昇華。</p>
<h3>俗語時</h3>
<p>— 白淵</p>
<p>淸代乾隆嘉慶間集俗諺爲對聯的風氣頗盛，周宗泰「更豈有此理」卷三，有「俗語集」一百八十四聯，張南莊」何典」，落魄道人「常言道」二書，也搜錄不少。輯成專書的，有王有光（觀國）「吳下諺聯」四卷（嘉慶庚辰刊本），錄一百四十九聯。甚至學人文集中，也有這類諺聯，像張文虎「舒藝室雜著」（收舒藝室全集」中）的「俗語集對」，便是一例。</p>
<p>又有集俗諺爲詩的，是集對聯的引伸，擴大，如「更豈有此理」卷三「俗語有」，集詩二十二首。首小序說：</p>
<p>「土普到處都有，而吾吳爲尤甚。畫永無聊，偶與小兒輩戲集古謠俗諺，連綴成詩。雖文不雅馴，今知識者笑；然所稱古老造言者，其中頗有意味，耐人尋繹。爰錄而存之，以供詩社談笑之資，工拙所不計也。後俗題評，意亦仿此。」所謂『頗有意味，耐人尋繹，。「也不過是門面話」其實只是文字游戲的一端而已。可注意的不是它的文學價値，而是文獻價値，足以說明這風氣的消長。二十二首中可觀的只有幾首，如遺病云：</p>
<p>「自家有病自家知，心病還將心藥醫。得放手時且放手，失便宜處是便宜。」</p>
<p>又詠錢云：</p>
<p>「東手接來西手去，別時容易見時難；一錢逼死英雄漢，　多少旁人冷眼看。」</p>
<p>這二首集俗諺頗自然，富有諧趣。　括俗語，是俳文一大特色。</p>
<p>集俗諺爲詩的風氣，到道光咸豐間，仍舊很盛，且有集成專書的，如邵懿辰「輯杭諺詩」。詩凡一百三十七首，光緒刊本，白棉紙印，書品頗精潔。書末有邵熙恩識語：</p>
<p>「此先叔位西公居恒游戲之作也。公少登賢書，由薇省八直樞密。才藻敏捷，判答如流。凡議論時事，慷慨直言絕無阿附，故都下咸嘖嘖稱之。嗣因乞歸，杜門嘯傲，日惟讀古文詞自娛。間以餘暇，集成五言杭諺詩一百三十七首，一時戚黨爭抄，雖婦孺亦樂吟誦。巧思綺合，起迄處每寓至理名言，不專以屬對爲工也。粤逆辛西之變，公殉於鄉；著作等身，竟罹劫火。……乙亥秋，恩奉差入都，於同鄉友家覓得此本，三復流連，覺公之談笑詼諧，宛富如昨，亟借歸手錄，留爲家實。……自宜付之手民，以供同好。……」</p>
<p>按邵懿辰字位西，仁和人，道光二十一年中特試，官中書舍人，歷刑部員外郎；後供職河工，被議，歸杭州，咸豐十一年殉難死。著有：「尙書大義」，佚；「儀禮通論」及「忱行錄」，有傳本。潘祖蔭等又輯錄其詩爲「蕙西先生遺稿」（計五十六首），收入「滂喜篇叢書」中。</p>
<p>邵詩一百餘首，較周宗泰之作多了六倍。但每首無題目，又用冷僻諺語不加注釋，是其缺點。其可取的如：</p>
<p>「雨落天留客，時襄鬼弄人。敲門提犯夜，引火自燒身。老虎吞蝴蝶，田鷄服惰民。三升三合命，撲手沒蓬麼。」</p>
<p>又如：「窮漢受罪畢，先生尋館忙。娶妻先看舅，有奶便爲娘。嫖賭吃着考，麻鬚黑胖長。打頭不應腦，姨呌百花香。」</p>
<p>又：</p>
<p>「所問非所答，可遇不可求。未歸三尺土，更上一層樓。寡慾多男子，未老先白頭。成人不自在，做鬼也風流。」</p>
<p>單看確是對仗工穩，但連綴成詩，殊有「莫明其土地堂」之感，或是文士之作較俗士終隔着一層？</p>
<p>此外，還有「吳諺詩鈔」一種。著者王璋，字欽喬，蘇州人，度曲家王季烈之叔，據王季烈跋謂曾七試省　未售，殆亦落魄者流。所錄計五律二百二十餘首，七言律絕各數十首，五律以韻分先後，七言都有題目。鉛字排印本一册。首羅亭祝君　序及王璋自序，均題辛酉，乃呈國十年也。似即入民國後所作，故不取。所以涉及這書的目的，乃在指出：此風迄今未泯也。邵懿辰杭州人周，宗泰，王璋蘇州人，這或是蘇杭文學的特色歟？</p>
<p>輯錄諺語以忠實記錄爲上，能保存牠的本來而目；但這學問上的事，前人殊乏客觀態度。葉為對聯，經過輯者剪裁，至聯合諺聯爲詩，已是末流了。惟前人能留意於俗事，俗物，已屬難能可貴。</p>
<h3>詩語</h3>

聽講，那便無多大關係了。　　在金元社會制度下，父子的名份雖存，道德的面目全非。有錢家庭的放縱兒女，與貧窮的家庭壓憎兒女同樣的使親子的關係脫出「愛」的軋迹。逆倫之　，就在於此。　　在新舊道德的過程中，我們慨嘆「道德淪亡」「人心不古，」這都是多餘的。影譚「迎春曲」  無邊　　「迎春曲」這是一部現實題材的作品，它並不以「色情」「間諜」來誘惑觀衆。這是近來放映的許多國產片中，難能可貴之作。　　作者用樸實無華的筆調，寫出了平民區裏一舊人的生活，在這一幢房子裏住有畫家·音樂家·詩人·私娼·小版·紫婦·風燭殘年的老婦人，以及放高利貸的二房東雌老虎，他們被人欺壓，被人凌辱，也有剝削着別人的人，總之作者用素描的筆調，勾劃出了現社會的一角，這一羣被欺壓被凌辱而生活在寒流裏的人們，正是今天那些受難者的寫照，他們掙扎在生活樣上，響往於溫暖和煦的日子。可是作者並沒有告訴他們寒流什麽時候可以過去，春天又以怎樣才能來臨，他祇讓他們等待着最多是去迎接。——事實上這樣是非常消極的。　　顯然作者的重心，是放在三個藝術家的身上，再配上那個私娼，以構成這個故事。但是這三個藝術家的生活圈子太狹小了，他們沒有去接觸更多的現實，別人也不懂得他們所習用的那些「言辭」，可以說不了解他們，連他們自已也承認這是知識份子的悲哀、其實這並不是知識份子的悲哀，而是這三個鑽在小圈子生活裏「藝術家」的悲哀這三個人中，音樂家在幹着洋琴鬼的職業，詩人在到處兜售他的詩集而只有那個畫家，幻想着創造偉大的作品，沒有真實的生活，除了最後，看到他在牆上為那個病中的私娼畫了一片葉子之外，其他就沒有幹過什麽了，在故事中間這個人物是佔着最重要位子的。此外那個私娼，雖然失去了丈夫孩子，但她並無家庭負担，靠自己解決一假人的生活，在她與三個藝術家相識後，竟會在生活上毫無變化，而三個人也沒有替她安排另外一種生活，——連僅使是提出意見都沒有，這說明了這個私娼的自甘墮落呢，還是對於別人的被凌辱漢不關心？人與人　之間關切，不能只是一些空洞的熟情，必須有具體的事實。　　至少現在看起來，這倆私娼是意識上走向於墮落的。　　雖然這個劇本有着這些缺點，但它在目前依然是一部較好的作品。警如攤販阿發的　子被沒收，以至出賣自己的血去換得生活代價，風燭殘年的老婦人，夢想着出征八年的兒子歸來。這些都是深刻而動人的。　　演員中，胡楓的私娼與范萊的阿發演得最佳，自然而生動，金燄的演技極穩健，但缺少了一點內在的心理創造，裴冲的角色較討好，也看得出他的努力。　　以導演成績來說，這部戲要比吳永剛過去任何一部戲的成績爲佳。電車漲價有感  徐芹　　電車·公共汽車已於九日紀漲價了。這件事，對一部份迫於生計的人，至少亦不能否認是種威脅。　　照理說來，自生活指數解凍後，電車，公共汽車漲價，是必然的事；而且，這所漲的微乎其妙的數目，有人認爲不足成爲問題。可是，這雖是理由，但他們却忘了那些處在另一種環境中的人。　　物漲新加，在许多机关，大概都是如此．然而，仔細想想，便知道有許多地方，則不然了。譬如一些規模狹小的店家，他們那裏店員的薪水，根本不會依照「生活指數」而提高。再次，便是一部份私小敎員，他們的薪水，蛟之前者，如同一轍。所以，電車公共汽車漲價，爲數固小，對於他們實在是很大的刺激。　　筆者身爲清高之職，在生活指數木曾解凍以前，薪俸爲數可憐，（因迫於路遠，天天以電車代步；除去車資所餘，已寥寥無幾）。然在目前，此數仍原封不動。現在，電車·公共汽車漲價了，看樣子，連電車。公共汽車亦要坐不起了！嘿，我不知道這究竟是可悲的呢，還是可嘆的。危城記  秦瘦鷗　　這時候又快到下午三四點鐘了，祝兆年在極度疲乏之餘，稍稍假寐了一會，可是心裏想着車子，想着緋緋，想着蘭，很快的立刻又自己驚醒了過來；他睜開倦眼，第一就忙着打量躺在自己臂灣裏的緋緋。他發覺這孩子似乎在喘大氣，臉色也蒼白了許多，眼睛顯得毫无神采的像離了水的魚。　　「緋緋，你要喝水嗎？累不累」？他低聲問。　　「頭痛、祝伯伯，緋緋頭痛」。她撅着小嘴，眼淚汪在的说　　雖然對帶領小孩子毫無經騐的老祝，也早就意料到像這樣的旅行決不是一個八歲的孩子所能耐受的，她的體力根本就抵抗不住这樣的疲勞和火车上敎他怎麽辦呢？　　他憂形於色地又在緋緋臉上注視了一下。　　緋绯的兩眼已經閉起來了，似乎想睡覺，但有些心神億躁，一時還睡不熟。　　「緋緋，現在覺得好一些嗎」？　　「要喝水，祝伯伯，有水嗎」？她焦急地問，兩片嘴唇上顯得非常的乾燥，儘用她自己的舌尖不住的在舐。　　祝兆年像餓狼似的睜大了一雙眸子，烱烱地向他四周的人羣中骏看，同時高聲地向大家間。「那一位行行好事？我這孩子病了！急着要喝水，誰肯分一杯來，要多少錢都给！謝謝你們！她祇有八歲咧…………」！　　喊了一會，好容易有一個中年婦人答應了，可是她責在也沒有水，——车上簡直沒有一個人再有一滴水——她只從一手巾包裏取出了吃剩的半顆怪酸澀的土生的梨兒來，鄭重地交给旁人，讓他們轉輾遞給老祝；但他一瞧那已經去了皮的黑膩的梨肉，心裏又眞害怕，不敢喂給緋緋吃。後來他想不出再好的方法，祗得先用自己的牙齒把外邊的肉啃掉了一層，然後再一小塊一小塊的咬下來，給緋緋咀嚼；可是這種土梨的滋味實在太酸了，緋緋只嘲了三塊，便用手推開，不肯再吃了。初夏云景  子愷</p>

<h3>Outer Mongolian Cavalry Invades Xinjiang; Soviet Aircraft Continuously Participate in Bombing; Our Diplomatic Authorities Resolve to Protest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 9th] According to reports received by the military authorities here from Asman, commissioner of the Altai region, and the garrison stationed at Baitashan: At noon on the 5th of this month, a battalion of Outer Mongolian cavalry, along with multiple military vehicles carrying light and heavy weapons, attacked our garrison stationed at Baitashan. At the time, four aircraft with Soviet markings provided aerial cover, dropping bombs and strafing. Our soldiers and civilians suffered casualties. The Outer Mongolian cavalry has now penetrated 600 li into our territory, and our troops are valiantly attempting to halt their advance. Baitashan is located 350 li northeast of Qitai, Xinjiang. Commissioner Asman was originally stationed in Chenghua, but since February of this year, he has been subjected to armed pressure from a certain party, retreating step by step, and finally retreating to Baitashan in mid-April.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 10th] The battle at Baitashan is still ongoing. Aircraft with Soviet markings continue to bomb our positions in multiple waves.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Semi-official sources stated on the 10th that a large force of Outer Mongolian troops, under the cover of four Soviet military aircraft, began attacking northwestern China on the 5th of this month and have now penetrated 200 miles inland. The military aircraft have been bombing and strafing Chinese towns, causing numerous civilian casualties. Correspondents from various newspapers in the capital are sending telegrams reporting details of the Outer Mongolian invasion. One report stated that Outer Mongolian cavalry, infantry, and artillery have already invaded Xinjiang. The spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense declined to comment on these reports.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is learned that regarding the invasion of our Xinjiang border by Outer Mongolian troops and the participation in the bombing by aircraft bearing Soviet markings, our diplomatic authorities will issue a protest on the 11th. It is said that the protest note may be delivered to Soviet Ambassador Petrov on the afternoon of the 11th for transmission to the government of the Outer Mongolian Republic. Our protest note is being delivered to the Soviet side for transmission to the Outer Mongolian government because, although our country has recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia, the two countries have not yet exchanged diplomatic envoys. According to information received by the authorities here, the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops began in mid-April, and the current depth of the Mongolian troops' incursion into our territory has reached 600 li. Most recently, at noon on the 5th, the Mongolian troops launched another attack, with four Soviet aircraft participating. Our defense forces, under the command of Song Xilian, are responsible for defending the territory and have resisted, with fighting ongoing in the Baitashan area. This is the third time Mongolian troops have invaded our territory in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>(Note: London radio also reported on the 10th the news of the Outer Mongolian army invading Xinjiang.)</p>

<h3>Both Old and New Factions of the Democratic Socialist Party Are Actively Engaging in Activities</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The split of the Democratic Socialist Party seems unavoidable. Zhang Junmai has now resolved to reorganize the party affairs and will expel Liang Qiushui and Wan Wu (one of the ten founders of the National Socialist Party) from the party. He has also dispatched a large number of personnel to various locations to engage in activities. The Innovation Committee of the opposition faction has also decided to convene a national congress of the Democratic Socialist Party next month and has dispatched a number of personnel to various regions to win the sympathy of party members. Liang Qiushui has already returned to Beiping from Shanghai by boat and will go to Tianjin within days to maintain contact. Lu Guangsheng will also come to Beiping soon to go to the Northeast with Liang Qiushui. Wu Xianzi is currently undecided and may merge with the Innovation Committee in the future, or may break away from the Democratic Socialist Party and re-establish the banner of the "Constitutional Government Party." Wu originally intended to return to Hong Kong, but a certain prominent figure in the opposition persuaded him to stay in Shanghai to observe the overall situation, so the date of his departure is yet to be determined. After Liang Qiushui returned to Beiping, he met with reporters and spoke frankly about the failure to mediate the internal disputes within the party, and called the Innovation Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party the real "Wang Mazi Scissors," because the National Socialist Party had a total of ten founders. Excluding Xu Qiao, Wang Bosha, and Hu Shijing who have passed away, Chen Bosheng and Zhang Dongshen who have left the party, and Liu Yushu who is detained as a traitor, there are still four founders remaining. Zhang Junmai's side only has himself, while the Innovation Committee still has three, namely himself, Wan Wu, and Tang Xiangming.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 10th] Cai Tingkai recently stated that Zhang Bojun, the person in charge of the Democratic League, made remarks involving his joining the Democratic League on behalf of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. He has now sent a letter to the Overseas Chinese Daily to correct this, stating that neither he personally nor the China Association for Promoting Democracy have joined the Democratic League. He also stated that recently, unscrupulous elements have been spreading rumors and creating trouble, organizing militias in the name of the Association or himself personally, and that the authorities should impose legal sanctions on them.</p>
<h3>The Research Committee of the Constitutional Government Association Holds a Convener Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Research Committee of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association held a convener meeting at 10:00 AM on the 10th on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. Committee members He Yangling and others attended. Liu Zhendong presided over the meeting. After exchanging opinions, they immediately discussed the proposals of the various committee members, and at the end decided that the third meeting of the association would be convened one day before the joint meeting.</p>
<h3>The King of England's Birthday Tomorrow; The Chairman Sends a Special Telegram of Congratulations</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] News from diplomatic circles: The 12th of this month is the King of England's birthday, and Chairman Chiang has sent a telegram of congratulations.</p>
<h3>The Chief Instigator of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in the Philippines, Sha Tu, Ignores His Ancestry; His Grandfather Was Chinese, Yet He Now Leads Anti-Chinese Activities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 10th] The existence and activities of the Anti-Chinese Alliance in the Philippines have been confirmed. Sha Tu, the chairman of the alliance, frankly admitted to a Central News Agency reporter that this narrow-minded nationalist and xenophobic organization is led by him. When asked by the reporter whether the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty, which has been signed for many days, is contrary to the spirit of friendship and why there is still no sign of the alliance disbanding, Sha Tu replied: The Anti-Chinese Alliance is still continuing to exist and operate "on the surface." The alliance was formed two years ago, and its purpose is purely to protect the rights and interests of the Filipino people, especially to protect the economic interests of Filipinos, and that is why the organization was created. It now has thousands of members, but since we are not excluding China or all Chinese people, but only protecting our own rights and interests, the term Anti-Chinese Alliance may not be very appropriate, and we should consider correcting it. The reporter met with Sha Tu during the Philippine Senate's discussion of the bill related to overseas Chinese. This anti-Chinese ringleader, who is six feet tall and has a pale face like an opium addict, is now over sixty years old. He has only been in office as a "Solon" (Filipinos call congressmen "Solon," meaning wise men) for one year, but he has put forward nearly a hundred bills, hence the title "one-bill-a-day congressman." Sha Tu, on the other hand, is proud of this. Most of the bills he has put forward are xenophobic, and he has gained the unconditional support of a section of voters because of this. When Sha Tu spoke with reporters, he often smirked, and the wrinkles on his forehead were enough to show his dishonorable experiences of fraud, crime, and exile. According to news from the overseas Chinese community, Sha Tu was originally an unemployed rogue. He escaped to Hong Kong after committing rape in his youth. He developed a hatred for the Chinese people because of being bullied by local gangsters. Later, he used bribery to end the rape case and was elected as a congressman based on his xenophobic stance. As for what he did during the occupation of the Philippine Islands, it is no longer possible to verify. According to Sha Tu himself, he will travel around the world when Congress adjourns at the end of this month and will visit the Chinese capital, Nanjing. The Chinese Consulate General in Manila will issue a free visa. He plans to stay in Nanjing for two or three days and may visit Chairman Chiang when possible. When asked by the reporter, "What is the purpose of visiting Chairman Chiang?" Sha Tu replied, "Just to pay my respects. I admire Chairman Chiang." Sha Tu admitted that his grandfather was Chinese and told the reporter that his wife had passed away, but she left behind two sons and one daughter, all of whom are lawyers.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Distributes Rewards to Commend the An'yang Garrison; The National Army in Northern Shaanxi Recovers Bao'an City</h3>

<h3>Relief for Refugees in Henan Province</h3>
<p>Providing Emergency Relief and Shelter Separately</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] Although the situation in northern Henan has recently eased, a large number of refugees continue to arrive from Fengqiu, Yanjin, and other counties. Currently, about 5,000 refugees are receiving food at the porridge distribution centers in Zhengzhou, and more than 4,000 others are being sent by the Emergency Refugee Relief Association to nearby counties for foster care or job placement. Dispersed orphans have been taken in by the Emergency Relief Brigade of the Henan Provincial Department of Social Affairs. There are about 10,000 refugees from southern Hebei scattered in Zhengzhou, Bianliang, Xinxiang, and Yancheng. The Department of Social Affairs is consulting with the Pacification Zone Emergency Relief Brigade on relief efforts, and 300 million yuan previously allocated by the Central Government for special projects will be distributed as emergency relief. The Provincial Government has also requested special funds from the Central Government to provide relief to about 400 refugees from southern Shandong who came to Zhengzhou via northern Henan. There is a total of 300,000 people inside An'yang City who need food. The province has already transported half of the 500 tons of food it plans to purchase by air to the city within 20 days. Because of the Communist army's attacks on northern Henan, more than 10,000 students from more than 20 schools have come south to Zhengzhou and Bianliang, and about half of them will be able to resume classes soon. The rest have volunteered to join the Youth Army, but they hope that the authorities can give them priority in the past and allow them to resume their studies in one year. The province has decided to airlift more than 5,000 students from An'yang to the south. As for the students from northern Henan who are studying in Zhengzhou and Bianliang, together with the 2,000 or more students who have recently come to Zhengzhou from northern Henan, they are requesting public funding for relief. The Central Government has approved an allocation of 1.5 billion yuan for the relief of the above-mentioned refugee students. The province has diverted 1.3 billion yuan from the land and food funds and the emergency relief funds for southern Henan. The 1,000 tons of flour approved by Chairman Chiang and the Executive Yuan will be distributed by the Henan branch as soon as it receives the order.</p>

<h3>The People's Political Council's Peace Proposals Are Slandered and Defamed by the Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Since the People's Political Council sent a telegram to the Chinese Communist Party calling for peace and inviting the Communist Party members of the People's Political Council to come to Nanjing immediately to participate in the meeting and resume peace talks, everyone has placed their hopes on it. However, a long time has passed and there has been no response. On the 5th of this month, the Xinhua News Agency broadcast its editorial, titled "The Broken Cart Cannot Be Driven Again," coldly slandering and defaming the People's Political Council's painstaking efforts to seek peace, pointing out that the council is "dominated by reactionary elements and has never been attended by communists. Even a very small number of people who sincerely hope for peace lack experience, so there is no reason to have any illusions about this People's Political Council." The agency also falsely accused that "the true face of the People's Political Council is a fanatical supporter of the civil war, an organ that calls for war, and people must never, and should not, believe its so-called peace calls." It also ridiculed the People's Political Council's sincere expression of "inviting the CCP members of the People's Political Council to come to Beijing to attend the meeting and jointly plan the national affairs," "requesting the CCP to send representatives to Beijing as soon as possible to unconditionally resume peace talks with the government," and "requesting the presidium and resident committee of the council to promote the realization of peace in the shortest possible time in the spirit of the resolutions of this conference" as "two bowls of tofu, that is, two bowls of tofu." The agency commented on the spirit of the People's Political Council's conference, requesting the government to declare a political solution again, that is, requesting the government to "quickly increase its troops to suppress the communist bandits," so its conclusion was that "the People's Political Council's peace proposal is unfortunately simply a rotten hairpin for a beauty."</p>

The National Army is on high alert.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] The National Army, which recovered Ju County in southern Shandong, continued to search and suppress the suburbs on the 10th and successively captured strongholds such as coal kilns and lime kilns.

<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 9th] When Chen Jiageng was asked by a Central News Agency reporter today about the statement made by Luo Longji, he denied that he was a major figure in the Democratic League. He said that when President Sun first visited Malaya, he invited him to join the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League), and since then, he has not joined any political party. Afterwards, when Chen returned to China to promote education, many of his colleagues joined various political parties, but he has never joined any political party because he is not interested in politics.</p>
<h3>The Rumor of Postponing the General Election This Autumn Has Been Denied by Director Dong of the Information Bureau</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Information Bureau, today denied reports that the general election, scheduled for August, will be postponed until next year, and that there are revisions to the constitutional implementation plan to convene the next National Assembly on Christmas.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the Executive Yuan's passage this morning of the plan to renovate the National Assembly Hall to increase the number of seats is sufficient proof that the above-mentioned reports are inaccurate.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It seems that the general election this autumn will be postponed due to practical difficulties. There have been rumors from all sides, even saying that it will be postponed for more than a year. A reporter from this newspaper made a special trip to visit Minister Zhang Lisheng of the Ministry of Interior on the 10th to ask for an explanation. According to Zhang, "I have not yet heard the news of this postponement. In fact, there are still half a year before the National Assembly session, and the election matters can definitely be completed within four months." He did not give a definite answer as to whether it would be postponed. As for other rumors that the general election may be postponed, the question is, if it needs to be postponed, in what form will it be done?</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] According to related sources, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have abandoned their demands for quota ratios in the upcoming general election, and the government has allowed the two parties to submit candidates to the various election offices in advance.</p>
<h3>Major War Brewing in the Northeast; National Army in Wula Street Makes Strategic Retreat; Yingkou and Andong Have Become More Stable</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] There is a new coordination in the fighting in North China and outside the Guan, and strong reinforcements are pouring out of the Guan.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] In the Northeast war situation, apart from local contacts in recent days, the general situation has been relatively quiet. It is reported that the Communist army is deploying on the periphery of Sipingjie, preparing for a major war, and the National Army is on alert at the outposts on the periphery of Siping. In addition, a part of the Communist army in southern Liaoning took the opportunity to capture Ximu City, 80 miles southeast of Haicheng on the southern section of the Changchun Railway, on the 9th. Because it poses a great threat to Haicheng and Anshan, the National Army is launching a counterattack. In addition, the port of Yingkou was previously avoided by many ships due to rumors, but it has now stabilized. A China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship docked at the port in the afternoon of the 9th, and more ships are coming.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Andong, 10th] Andong Province, as the adjacent war zone, was once frightened by the Communist army's intrusion into the south bank of the Songhua River, but the war situation has improved in recent days, and the people here have regained their stability. Shops in the city have resumed business one after another, and there are no signs of skyrocketing prices.</p>
<p>The Changchun Railway is Severely Destroyed; Two-Thirds of Traffic is Blocked</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] Since the Communist army destroyed the Changchun Railway everywhere, two-thirds of the railway has been blocked. Currently, it only connects to Xiongyue in the south and Zhonggu, north of Tieling, in the north, a total length of 290 kilometers. The extent of the losses cannot be estimated. Bridges in the lost areas have been mostly destroyed, and the restoration of the Dongliao River Bridge is particularly difficult.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The Jilin Railway Bureau under the Ministry of Communications has 489 kilometers of railways under its jurisdiction, including Jichang, Changtao, Jidun, and Jihai, which have been repeatedly destroyed by the Communist army in recent years. According to statistics from the Railway Repair Engineering Corps of the bureau, 67 bridges were destroyed, totaling 113 spans and a length of 1,300 meters.

<h3>Discussions on Economic Measures at the Economic Commission Meeting Continue; Grain Rationing to Be Implemented Immediately; Property Tax Collection to Be Studied by a Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 10th] The work of the National Economic Commission has entered a concrete and practical stage. At the meeting this afternoon on the 10th, actual discussions were held on issues such as food and subsidies. Regarding the sale of state-owned enterprises, the meeting conducted in-depth discussions and has reached a decision in principle. However, due to the magnitude of the matter and the fact that lists from various agencies have not yet been submitted, it was decided to request Zhang Jia'ao, Weng Wenhao, and Qian Zisun to conduct further research and organize the text for presentation at the next meeting. Regarding the grain rationing issue, after detailed research, it was determined that the food supply for major cities will be secure for the next four months. Plans are also underway for the grain supply beyond October, and it is believed that there will not be major problems. It was originally planned to implement rationing in the nine major cities first. However, given the dense populations of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin and their higher demand for grain, it was decided to implement it there first. The meeting also conducted a detailed review of issues such as how to ensure that the true common people and public servants benefit from the rationing. Another issue that the meeting emphasized was the subsidy policy. In principle, subsidies will be gradually reduced. A detailed list of current subsidies will be compiled to study which should be discontinued, which should be reduced, and which should have their profits turned over to the national treasury. In addition, regarding cost-cutting, the establishment of some agencies that were budgeted for but not yet established should be stopped, and those with ineffective operations will also be studied to determine which should be abolished and which should be downsized. As for the one-time property tax issue that is of general concern, the collection plan drafted by the Ministry of Finance was also discussed at the meeting. However, because there were still technical aspects that needed to be studied, it was handed over to the fiscal subcommittee for further research. After a decision is made by the meeting, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan to complete the legislative process and then implemented. Other issues such as the opening of new taxes or the reorganization of old taxes all require detailed figures and have also been submitted to the subcommittee for research. In general, the commission is conducting technical and concrete reviews on both revenue enhancement and cost-cutting to understand the overall income and expenditure situation for the second half of the year, in order to plan for future contingencies. The meeting today was held at approximately 3:00 PM, chaired by Zhang Jia'ao. More than 20 people attended, including Weng Wenhao, Gu Zhenglun, and Yu Hongjun. The meeting adjourned at approximately 8:00 PM. The fourth meeting will be held again next Monday, and the subcommittees will also continue to meet within the week.</p>
<p>In addition, the issue of workers' dependents was also discussed in detail at the Economic Commission meeting on the 10th. The meeting noted that the profit and loss situations of various factories differ, and the base salaries of workers also vary. Some workers do not even have a base salary. If a uniform regulation were to be made, it would be difficult to satisfy all parties. Many opinions were expressed at the meeting, hoping that labor and management could coordinate, share the hardships, understand and accommodate each other, and work together to find a solution. If an agreement cannot be reached, it is hoped that they can listen to the arbitration of the local social bureaus.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] To cooperate with the emergency economic measures plan, the authorities have decided to sell the part of the China Grain Corporation's capital that was invested by the Ministry of Food to private businesses by issuing stocks. The measures have been drafted by the Ministry of Food and will be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Opens Trade to Japan; Our Authorities Take It Very Seriously; Shanghai Business Circles Believe Export Trade Will Be Threatened</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 10th] The financial and economic authorities are taking the U.S. opening of foreign trade to Japan very seriously. According to those familiar with the market situation, Japanese goods at factory prices have already been discovered in various places. Some are even products manufactured in Japan under the names of other countries' companies. This matter deserves serious attention.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the U.S. State Department and the Department of the Army announced that the U.S. would open foreign trade to Japan starting August 15th of this year, import and export trade circles here believe that the opening date is too early, and the result will be that Japan will become a competitor to us in international trade again. It was pointed out that our country's export goods, such as cotton cloth, raw silk, straw hats, buttons, umbrella handles, and fish products, will all suffer severe threats. Currently, our country is facing unrest, and there are many local difficulties. Production has not yet been put on the right track, while Japan, under the control of the Allied forces, is gradually restoring production. The currency system is stable, and wages are even lower, so in terms of production conditions, it poses a serious threat to us. Therefore, it is hoped that when our country's commercial delegation goes to Japan, it should argue on the basis of reason and urge the Allied forces to tighten control.</p>
<p>According to a textile industry magnate, Japan's cotton textile industry has now recovered to about three million spindles. This number is enough to meet the national clothing needs, and there is still a surplus for export. However, the Allied forces consider the textile industry to be the easiest light industry for Japan to restore and easy to obtain foreign exchange, so there is a saying that they will be allowed to increase to six million spindles this year. If this number is reached, our yarn market in Southeast Asia will again suffer severe competition from Japanese goods. What is even more worrying is that the Fengjie Machinery Factory was not damaged during the war, and the recovery of the production of spindle machines is very rapid. If the Allied forces relax control and allow them to develop, the future of Japan's textile industry cannot be ignored. According to the current trend, Japan's textile industry will not pose a major threat to us in the short term, but the seriousness lies in its future development.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Province Welcomes Rain After Prolonged Drought</h3>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Correspondent, 10th] Shanxi has suffered from a severe drought this spring. Wheat seedlings can still be seen everywhere in the fields. In the best areas, the harvest will be reduced by half. If it does not rain, the autumn planting will be delayed. In the Taiyuan area, there was a sudden rain on the 8th and 9th, with intermittent drizzle for two days and nights. A steady rain has been falling since the 10th, and it has already reached two inches by noon. The weather is like late autumn, and it seems to be a thorough rain. The people are all very happy and are preparing to cultivate. However, only short-term maturing millet, buckwheat, and corn can be planted, and there is no hope of a full harvest.</p>
<h3>Japan Hopes to Set Exchange Rates First; Finance Minister Still Expresses Dissatisfaction with MacArthur's Measures</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 10th] It is said here that MacArthur's decision to open Japan's private foreign trade relations on the second anniversary of Japan's surrender (August 15th) can be regarded as the most important event for Japan after the end of the war. Although these people are satisfied with this, they are also well aware that there are still various problems to be solved before Japan can truly restore foreign trade relations. Finance Minister Yano recently commented: "First of all, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen must be set, otherwise Japanese merchants will inevitably encounter difficulties when trading with foreign countries." Naka Kaoru, chairman of the Japan Foreign Trade Association, also emphasized the need to solve the exchange rate issue first and proposed two conditions for restoring Japan's international trade: (1) import raw materials, especially cotton, wool, rubber, and iron sheets; (2) solve the compensation issue so that the Japanese industrial community can use the remaining equipment to carry out production plans. People in the Japanese financial community believe that although MacArthur's decision is not without its shortcomings, it is enough to give Japan's future economy a bright future and achieve peace as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani said in a statement on the 10th: "Japan can welcome foreign trade delegations and is very grateful. However, Japan's trade will still be conducted under the control of the Allies, and the foreign exchange rate has not yet been determined, which is not perfect. Therefore, even if trade is restored, it will only be trade between the delegation and the Trade Agency."</p>
<p>Initial Private Transactions Will Be Barter</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] According to a joint announcement by the Department of the Army and the State Department: "Private traders who trade with Japanese manufacturers will have the trade goods evaluated by experts from MacArthur's headquarters to determine a fair price." Therefore, the initial transactions between private traders and Japan will mostly be barter, with raw materials exchanged for Japanese handicrafts and silk fabrics. MacArthur's headquarters and Japanese officials expect that private commerce will, in the initial stage, only stimulate the limited export trade that the U.S. and Japanese governments are currently conducting. As for Japan's large-scale manufacturing of export goods, it is still impossible due to the lack of raw materials, the undetermined method of compensation, and the poor domestic economic adjustment. For example, less than 25 percent of the factories in the Osaka industrial area that are currently in operation are operating at full capacity. The main reason is that the business community is hesitant about the compensation method, and there is a lack of coal, lubricating oil, and electricity. According to MacArthur's headquarters officials, allowing private traders (initially limited to 400 people) to go to Japan will slightly increase current exports. It is expected that they will guide the Japanese to manufacture silk fabrics and works of art that suit American tastes, instead of the outdated products that Japanese merchants generally make. They will encourage the Japanese to make more pottery and other items.</p>
<p>Australian Government Requests Increase in Number of Australian Merchants</p>
<p>The private trade representatives who are allowed to go to Japan after August 15 are assigned by various countries. The Australian government reacted very quickly and has announced that it will ask MacArthur's headquarters to increase the number of merchant representatives from Australia, because of Australia's "geographical location" and the large amount of pre-war trade with Japan.</p>
<h3>Flooding in Various Parts of Guangdong Province; The Yingde Bridge on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Was Destroyed; Commerce in Huiyang Is at a Standstill Due to Several Feet of Water</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 10th] Continuous rain in various parts of Guangdong Province has caused rivers to swell, causing severe disasters that are rare in the past 20 years. Both land and water transportation have been affected. Five piers of the Yingde Bridge on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway were destroyed, so the Guangdong-Hankou train has again stopped heading north. The water level of the Northeast and East Rivers is the highest, with the highest water level in Huizhou reaching 12.0 meters, and the Right River also reaching 11.50 meters. Both sides of the river have become swamps, and the water depth in Huiyang City is three to four feet, and commerce has stopped. The loss of crops is even greater, with tens of thousands of acres of good land being flooded. The Mating Post, which was built not long ago, was eroded due to the new soil not being strong, and the breach was more than a thousand feet. The Cixi Gate was also broken, and more than 2,000 nearby villagers gathered and tried their best to rescue it, but the dangerous situation has not diminished. The local Water Conservancy Bureau has sent a large number of people to various places to supervise the emergency repair of the embankment project. Fortunately, the sky has cleared since the 10th, and the rise of the rivers has slowed down.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Passes Emergency Economic Measures; Content Subject to Allied Approval</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Japanese Cabinet today passed emergency economic measures regarding the restoration of export trade. The meeting also discussed the imbalance in import and export plans under the control of the headquarters over the past two years and the possibility of a crisis in the near future. On the 6th and 7th, the heads of various economic departments who met with Hiroo Wada, Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, to formulate emergency economic plans, emphasized that Japan needs to reform its economy and produce goods that can be exported to pay for necessary imports. The details of the emergency economic measures are still unknown. Last week, Tetsu Katayama said that the emergency economic plan mainly relies on the support of the people. Cabinet officials said tonight that the cabinet's implementation of the measures passed today relies heavily on the support of labor. Minister of Commerce and Industry Changzaburo Mizutani said after the cabinet meeting that the government does not believe that the Communist Party has the power to lead the labor unions to obstruct the labor's support for this measure. The cabinet's economic plan can reflect the Japanese government's efforts to save the current situation, because the Americans have gradually resented buying food for the Japanese and do not want to supply raw materials any longer. The Katayama Cabinet hopes to lay the foundation for the recovery of export industries by collecting enough coal for industrial use, stopping the black market, stabilizing the domestic economy, stopping inflation, and absorbing union figures with connections. Officials admit that solving economic problems is not entirely a domestic matter, and it is necessary to import raw materials from abroad before large quantities of export goods can be produced. The emergency economic measures indirectly emphasize the relationship between Japan's current situation and the issues after the signing of the peace treaty and support MacArthur's argument that Japan is ready to sign the peace treaty, so the economic plan passed today should be signed as soon as possible. Although it generally reflects a socialist background, it is a compromise with the Democratic Party, which strongly opposes the socialization of industry except for state control of basic coal mining. As for the goal of establishing new export industries, it is a natural move for any Japanese government at present, regardless of its political ideals.</p>

<h3>The Dutch Detained Chinese Merchant Ships; Agreed to Compensate 500,000 Currency</h3>
<p>Relevant Chinese Merchants Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 10th] Lee Guangqian, President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, said that the six ships of goods of Singaporean Chinese merchants that were previously detained by the Dutch authorities in Indonesia have now been proposed by the Dutch to pay 500,000 Malayan dollars as compensation. However, the amount of compensation requested by the Chinese merchants is 4 million dollars, and the difference is so great that it is not expected to be accepted by the Chinese merchants. The Dutch proposal arrived late yesterday and stated that it would compensate with goods instead of money and promised to establish a trade system between Indonesia and Singapore.

<h3>How Can We Encourage Japan Again!</h3>
<p>Washington, D.C., June 9th, United Press: The U.S. State Department has formally announced the opening of foreign trade with Japan. Starting August 15th, 400 foreign business representatives will be allowed to travel to Japan to resume private trade and will be able to contact Japanese manufacturers directly without restrictions. The transmission of this cable, although within our expectations, still feels premature to open foreign trade with Japan before a peace treaty is convened and before the issue of Japanese reparations is resolved, regardless of the angle from which it is observed.</p>
<p>The U.S. has long desired to open foreign trade with Japan in order to accelerate Japan's economic recovery and reduce the burden on American taxpayers. At the beginning of last month, the Far Eastern Commission expressed its hope to open private foreign trade with Japan in July of this year and consulted the governments of China and the Philippines on this issue. At the same time, trade delegations from both Britain and the United States visited Japan to conduct on-site inspections. Now, finally, despite the opposition of China and the Philippines, it has been decided to resume foreign trade with Japan starting August 15th. Whether for the sake of peace in the Far East or for the benefit of the United States itself, the United States must reconsider this important measure.</p>
<p>The Philippine government has already expressed its strong opposition to the opening of foreign trade with Japan. However, the Philippine government's view is only focused on the issue of reparations. They believe that after opening foreign trade with Japan, Japan will have the opportunity to restore industrial production, and Japan can use this as an excuse to demand the preservation of Japanese industrial equipment, thereby affecting the payment of reparations to the Philippines. As for our country's reasons for opposing the opening of foreign trade with Japan, in addition to the views of the Philippines, we also believe that before the Allied Powers sign a peace treaty with Japan and before the issue of Japanese reparations is resolved, Japan must not be allowed to resume private trade with foreign countries. Because Japan was a highly industrialized country before the war: Japan's import trade was mainly food, cotton, wool, and other items; and its export trade was mainly cotton textiles, raw silk, and tea. It not only monopolized the markets in Southeast Asia but also occupied a very important position in the global commodity market. In particular, Japanese cotton textiles have always been strong rivals to Britain and the United States in the world market. Therefore, opening foreign trade with Japan will not only hinder the growth of our country's textile industry, but Britain and the United States will also encounter a strong rival in the market, and damage the growth of our country's textile industry.</p>
<p>In recent months, the defeated Japan has been stirring again, and it has already become clear. In terms of military preparations, Japan has requested the Allied Powers to grant "a small amount of military force"; in terms of territory, Japan has attempted to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States and hopes to obtain special immigration rights in Taiwan; in terms of economy, the demands put forward by the Japanese are even more numerous. The most important of these is Japan's request to reduce the industrial equipment used for reparations. According to a June 9th report from the New Asia News Agency in Tokyo, the Japanese government appears to be extremely compliant with the issue of reparations on the surface, but in reality, it is using various methods to try to reduce the burden of reparations. The Socialist Party has formed a "Reparations Countermeasures Committee" and has decided on three principles: (1) Among the reparations factories designated by MacArthur's headquarters, investigate and study the machines related to the revitalization of Japanese industry, and even if it is a single machine or a factory, reasons should be given to MacArthur to apply for its return to Japan. (2) Among the reparations factories designated by MacArthur's headquarters, investigate and study the equipment related to maintaining the minimum living standards of the people, and apply to MacArthur for its return to Japan. (3) Explain the actual situation of the first two items to the public as much as possible to arouse the attention of the general public.</p>
<p>From this, we can see Japan's deliberate planning. Japan's every move towards the United States is quite similar to the story of "Goujian serving Fucha" in our country's history. The United States allowing the opening of foreign trade with Japan is no less than giving the Japanese a great encouragement. Therefore, we must loudly appeal to the U.S. authorities: the United States must know that leniency can breed evil, and indiscriminate generosity will inevitably harm oneself and others. The final result will not only threaten the safety of the United States in the Pacific but also cause the entire Far East to have no peace and stability. Prevention is better than cure. The United States must be cautious in dealing with Japan and must not be fooled by the Japanese. The lesson of the Pearl Harbor incident should never be forgotten. Even from an economic point of view, opening foreign trade with Japan can indeed reduce the burden on American taxpayers in supporting Japan, but after promoting Japan's economic recovery, Japan's aggressive ambitions will inevitably be revived. How will the United States deal with it then? Will it not become a serious issue again? Therefore, we ask the U.S. authorities to broaden their horizons, face reality, and not be penny-wise and pound-foolish. We sincerely hope that the U.S. authorities, for the sake of peace in the Far East and for their own benefit, will reconsider the matter of opening foreign trade with Japan! Creating a situation where Japan can no longer be encouraged.</p>
<p>In short, if Japan's foreign trade is truly opened, then in the near future, "cheap and high-quality Oriental goods" will flood the world market again. The defeated countries are smiling, while the victorious countries are frowning. This is truly a terrifying contrast. We must firmly argue our case, demanding that the United States broaden its horizons and reconsider its attitude, postponing the date of opening foreign trade with Japan until after the closing of the peace treaty with Japan. But the most important thing is our own country. We hope that the entire nation will seriously reflect on the current situation, work hard to reform, raise vigilance, and always guard against the rebirth of Japan's aggressive ideology!</p>

<h3>Strengthening Cooperation Among Western Hemisphere Nations; Truman Visits Canada; Canada May Participate in Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Washington, June 9th] President Truman left here tonight by special train for a three-day goodwill visit to Ottawa, Canada. The First Lady, daughter, White House staff, and over forty American and foreign journalists accompanied him.</p>
<p>[Report from Reuters, Washington, June 9th] President Truman is scheduled to leave here by train for Canada tonight (Tuesday morning, Shanghai time) for a three-day official visit. It is expected that his time in Canada will give new impetus to negotiations between the United States and Canada. The outcome of these negotiations may enable Canada to participate in Secretary of State Marshall's "Continental Plan" to aid Europe. Authoritative sources revealed: U.S. and Canadian officials have already discussed solutions to Canada's increasingly serious dollar problem. The seriousness of this problem is no less than that faced by many European countries. President Truman will hold further discussions on the aforementioned issues when he meets with Canadian Prime Minister King, and the wartime cooperation between the U.S. and Canada to solve raw material and production problems may also be restored. Canada's trade with the U.S. is currently in a similar situation to that of many European countries, with imports exceeding exports. At the same time, after Canada's loans to Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and China are exhausted, Canada may have a large supply of wheat, beef, and other commodities urgently needed by foreign countries, but foreign countries lack the financial resources to purchase them. On the other hand, Canada relies entirely on imports from the United States for coal, oil, and other necessities, but because Canada lacks dollars, it is unable to pay for the import of these necessities. One expert stated: Canada cannot continue to sell goods to Europe on credit while buying from the United States on a cash basis. One solution to Canada's difficult situation is to restore some form of the wartime "Hyde Park Agreement," where Canada would sell its surplus wheat, timber, beef, etc. to the United States at prices lower than domestic market prices for export to countries in Europe in need. This would immediately solve Canada's dollar problem and would also allow it to cooperate with the United States in carrying out a large-scale relief plan for European countries.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service Local Report] The U.S. "Voice of America" will broadcast President Truman's speech to the joint session of the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa to China on June 12th from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM (Shanghai Summer Time). This program will replace the regular English program "The Music We Love" and can be heard on the following stations: frequencies 15250, 15150, 11790, 11730, 9650, 9490.</p>
<h3>Austrian Chancellor Makes Solemn Statement; Determined Not to Be Manipulated by the Communist Party; Secretary Marshall Approves of the European Federation Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from United Press, Vienna, June 9th] Austrian Chancellor Figl issued a formal announcement after holding an emergency meeting of the People's Party, denying that he had contacted the Communist Party or intended to resign. He stated, "The Chancellor will only resign when the Austrian people demand his resignation by a large majority, and new elections will only be held when the constitution of the Democratic Republic of Austria requires it, or when the majority of the Austrian people decide to hold a vote." Fischer, the Moscow-trained leader of the Austrian Communist Party, had previously told reporters that the Chancellor had indicated to him during a recent meeting that the Chancellor was willing to expand the government to include more Communist Party members, or else he would resign during the new elections. Figl continued in the announcement: In the past twelve months, Fischer has constantly attempted to hold private talks with the Chancellor. Finally, the Chancellor agreed to hold a meeting on June 5th. However, to the Chancellor's surprise, Fischer went beyond the scope of private talks and raised current national policy issues. Chancellor Figl continued, "Therefore, no negotiations took place, and no decisions were made. Therefore, he did not think there was any reason to inform the Socialist Party members in the government of the contents of the talks." According to U.S. military authorities, the purpose of the Austrian manager's actions is to reveal the weakness of the Austrian Communist Party before the Communist Party can seize Austrian power (as in the Hungarian coup).</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, Washington, June 10th] It was revealed today that Secretary of State Marshall has given conditional support to the principle of a European Federation. According to reliable sources in Congress, Marshall sent a letter to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, regarding Senator Fulbright's proposed bill, which supports a European Federation, the first time it has been seen in the congressional record. In his letter, Marshall stated that although he strongly sympathized with the European Federation proposal, he believed that any bill passed by Congress should include a preamble stating that the United States had no preconceived notions about any form of federation. According to a diplomat's message: The United States has rejected the Communist Party's attempt to forcibly reorganize the Austrian government. He said that the news from Vienna seems to be part of the Communist Party's attempt to expand its power in Central and Eastern Europe, as was implemented in Hungary. However, the situation in Vienna is very different from that in Budapest, because the occupation of the Austrian capital is jointly participated in by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, rather than being undertaken by the Soviet Union alone, as was the case in Hungary. He also pointed out that this situation is not only true for the city of Vienna, but also for the entire country.</p>
<h3>Bullitt Urges U.S., Britain, and France to Organize a European Democratic League and Exposes the Soviet Union's Intentions Towards Europe</h3>
<p>[Report from Reuters, Washington, June 9th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Bullitt, gave a speech at Georgetown University tonight, urging the U.S., Britain, and France to quickly organize a European Democratic League before the Soviet Union occupies the entire European continent, and said that only U.S. military power can prevent the Red Army from occupying all of Europe. Bullitt said that every European knows that if the remaining democratic countries in Europe cannot unite to implement mutual defense, then these countries will be annexed by the Soviet Union one by one. If the U.S. government can persuade the British and French governments to jointly establish a European Democratic League with it, so that all countries with democratic systems and respect for the Bill of Rights, including the states of Germany, can join this league, then the trust and hope of the people of European democratic countries can be restored. Soviet leaders would never dare to launch a war against the United States or its friends, because they know that the current strength of the United States is far greater than that of the Soviet Union and its affiliated countries. However, they will launch an attack when they believe that their own strength is greater than ours. Today, what can prevent Stalin from ordering the Red Army to occupy all of Europe is only the superiority of U.S. military force and the atomic bomb.</p>
<h3>The Austro-Hungarian Border is Not Tense</h3>
<p>[Report from Reuters, Austro-Hungarian Border, June 9th] It has recently been rumored that the Hungarian authorities have tightened security measures around Lake Neusiedl on the Austro-Hungarian border. However, after the reporter inspected a 20-mile stretch of the border, no special security measures were found.

According to Austrian border officials, Austrian and Hungarian farmers are still crossing the border as usual every day. When the reporter inspected the border, he did not see any special phenomena such as a large number of refugees pouring in.</p>
<h3>Wallace Comments on the Political Situation in Hungary and Bulgaria</h3>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, Newark, New Jersey, June 9th] Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace told reporters today that the recent events in Hungary and Bulgaria are a direct consequence of the Truman Doctrine. Britain and the United States have already gained Greece and Turkey because of the Truman Doctrine, and the Soviet Union should also have Hungary and Bulgaria.</p>
<h3>Secretary Marshall is Making the Final Review of the U.S. Government's Protest to the Soviet Union; Agrees to Establish a Committee to Investigate the Causes of the Hungarian Coup</h3>
<p>[News from our office] San Francisco, June 10th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall returned after attending the graduation ceremony of the Virginia Military Institute and personally handled the steps the United States should take in response to the Hungarian coup, and finally decided on the wording of the protest note to the Soviet Union. The draft of the note has been circulated among various government agencies and has been agreed to by the British Foreign Office. According to officials, the note does not contain any threatening tone. If the reply is not considered satisfactory, the United States will raise the case with the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Report from Reuters, London, June 9th] Minister of State McNeil stated in Parliament in response to a question from a member of Parliament that the Soviet Union should be judged on the actions of the new government of Hungary. The British government hopes that the change in the Hungarian government will not lead to a departure from the principles of parliamentary democracy. If there is any such development, it will inevitably seriously affect the relationship between Britain and Hungary.</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, London, June 9th] Regarding the recent coup in Hungary, the United States intends to send a note to the Soviet representative to the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, Sviridov, to express its protest. A copy of the note has been sent to the British Foreign Office. According to well-informed sources, after receiving the copy, the British Foreign Office immediately sent a reply to the U.S. State Department, stating that Britain agrees to establish a tripartite committee consisting of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to investigate the various events that caused the Hungarian coup. It is rumored that former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy intends to form a government in exile. London has not heard of this. In addition, the British Foreign Office is also closely monitoring the events that have occurred in Bulgaria. After the arrest of Bulgarian opposition leader Petkov, strong protests from the U.S. and Britain were aroused, but Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov condemned the protests as "interference in Bulgaria's internal affairs." British officials believe that the Bulgarian Prime Minister's statement is unreasonable and that Britain and the United States have the right to supervise whether Bulgaria is complying with the basic laws of democracy, because Bulgaria has made a promise to comply with such laws.</p>
<p>[Report from Associated Press, Hungary, June 9th] Sviridov, the acting chairman of the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, sent a brief note to the head of the U.S. military delegation today, rejecting the U.S. request to provide a copy of the testimony of Kovács, the former Secretary-General of the Smallholders Party. The British request for a copy was also rejected by the Soviet side last week.</p>
<h3>The French Government Formally Announces the Revision of the Saar Region Boundary; Britain and the United States are Expected to Support It</h3>
<p>[Report from Associated Press, Paris, June 10th] French authorities announced today that France has revised the boundary of the Saar region for economic reasons, temporarily including the city of Saarlouis into French territory pending the signing of a peace treaty with Germany. The French side has sent a formal note to the authorities of the other three countries in the German occupation zone, stating that France has moved the boundary line southeastward from Saarlouis and several villages near Treves, and the old boundary line will cut off the Treves area from its trade area. The German territory affected by the boundary revision is all within the French occupation zone in Germany.</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, Paris, June 10th] Regarding the resolution of the Saar region's boundary, France has reduced the area of its industrial zone from 17.9 million miles to 15.76 million square miles and the population from 880,000 to 852,000. The area of the region in 1919 was 1,204 square miles, and the population was 788,000.</p>
<p>(Agence France-Presse, Paris, June 9th) Officials recently announced that "Saar Mark" will henceforth be the new currency system of the Saar region. The currently circulating German Mark will be withdrawn at a ratio of one to one and replaced with "Saar Marks." According to well-informed sources, the purpose of this measure is to prepare the Saar region for economic integration with France, without changing the Saar region's legal status.</p>
<p>[Report from Reuters, London, June 9th] Diplomatic observers here believe that Britain is now prepared to accept the French government's recently proposed new boundary for the Saar and intends to support it in future discussions on German boundaries. It is not yet known what the U.S. government's attitude towards this matter is. It is expected that the British government will not publicly express its agreement with France's new demands before it is certain of the U.S. attitude.</p>
<h3>The United States Values Okinawa; Will Make the Island an Outpost Base</h3>
<p>[Report from United Press, Okinawa, June 2nd] (Delayed) Americans on Okinawa believe that the United States should announce its detailed plans for Okinawa in the near future, so that the U.S. plan to rebuild the island into an important base in the Western Pacific can be carried out. Americans here unanimously believe that Okinawa, which the U.S. obtained at the cost of 35,000 deaths and injuries, will remain under U.S. occupation. However, they insist that if the U.S. military position in the Western Pacific is to be maintained, it is necessary to rebuild the military base as soon as possible. If events in the Far East proceed as planned, the U.S. will sign a peace treaty with Japan early next year. The treaty is expected to formally recognize U.S. possession of Okinawa and stipulate that most of the U.S. military and its equipment in Japan, including hundreds of aircraft, be withdrawn immediately. It is believed that MacArthur and his staff will propose that most of the U.S. troops, especially the air force, should be withdrawn to Okinawa. The island, along with Guam, will henceforth be regarded as important U.S. bases in the Far East. In order for Okinawa to be large enough to accommodate 100,000 to 200,000 troops, a large amount of money and a long period of time will be required, and it must be carried out as soon as possible. According to opinions here, there is no doubt that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan will begin in the next twelve months. If these troops are withdrawn to Okinawa, they should be provided with permanent housing. Some troops have been transferred to the island from the Philippines, and more troops may be transferred. Due to the frequent typhoons on the island, the barracks must be sturdily built. Therefore, Americans here believe that the most urgent need now is to immediately decide on the political future of the island and a large-scale development plan for the island. This can enable Okinawa to stand alongside Guam as an outpost of U.S. democracy in the Western Pacific.</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] The Chinese Deputy Representative to the United Nations, Mr. Hsia Chin-lin, today took the lead in firmly opposing the Soviet proposal that major nations provide equal numbers of soldiers, warships, and aircraft to form a world standby force.

Moreover, the Soviet Union itself has issues with aircraft carriers. It is expected that during this afternoon's discussion, the British representative will echo China's position, insisting that countries must contribute military strength "comparatively" and that a world standby force should not be established immediately.</p>

Mr. Armour served as U.S. Ambassador to Argentina from 1939 to 1944, and as Ambassador to Spain from December 1944, returning to the U.S. after one year in that post. He is highly experienced in Latin American affairs.

<h3>Fifty Crew and Passengers of the Dafeng Wheel Missing, Presumed Dead; More Than 170 Survivors Transported to Shanghai and Nantong; Director of Maritime Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Inspect Scene of Accident Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Dafeng wheel of the Dafeng Shipping Bureau sank due to an accident caused by wind near the Liuhou Estuary late at night on the 9th. The matter has already been noted in yesterday's newspaper. According to the person in charge of the Dafeng wheel Bureau, the wheel had a total of 46 employees, approximately 14 tea servers, 93 passengers with tickets for merchant ships, and 72 passengers who bought tickets after boarding the wheel, for a total of approximately 225 people. The China Oil Wheel Company's number 128 wheel and the Shanshui wheel rescued 132 people. Furthermore, the Xiangli Shipping Company's Xiangli seagoing wheel rescued 29 people (7 of whom were crew members). These 29 people have already been sent to Nantong Ren port by the Xiangli wheel. Also, an unknown number of sand wheels rescued more than 10 people. A total of more than 170 people have been rescued, so as of now, there are still approximately 50 people whose whereabouts are unknown. The complete list of survivors has been copied by the Dafeng wheel Bureau and posted at the entrance of the Bureau. Some of the passengers were transferred to Nantong by the Dafeng Bureau through the Baofeng and Jiangkang wheels last night. All wheel tickets and meals were borne by the Bureau. Yesterday, from dawn to dusk, relatives of the passengers of the Dafeng wheel went to the agency to inquire one after another. Those who saw their names on the list were all overjoyed. The Dafeng Shipping Bureau only has this one wheel, and it was not insured beforehand, so it declared bankruptcy after this accident. Regarding the passengers and crew members who have not yet been rescued and are missing, the company requested the Maritime Affairs Bureau to ask the Executive Yuan Water Transport Brigade to dispatch a tug-barge wheel to wait, but there was still nothing to be gained until last night. Today, it will continue to send the landing craft Shenhua wheel to the scene of the accident to search for survivors.</p>
<p>Yongzhang Wheel Acts Righteously and Does Its Best to Help</p>
<p>According to Dafeng crew members who spoke to reporters, if it hadn't been for the China Oil Wheel Company's Yongzhang wheel, the number of deaths would have reached more than 100. The Yongzhang wheel used various methods to rescue those who fell into the water, and its spirit of righteousness is truly admirable. It is heard that the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Shipping Guild have telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to report the Dafeng wheel's accident and the Yongzhang wheel's spirit of righteousness. As for the list of the deceased, it is still being investigated.</p>

<h3>Typhoon Passes Into the Sea: Weather Expected to Improve Within Days</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Previously, Shanghai was affected by the eastward advance of the low-pressure system in Hunan and Guizhou, which was obstructed by the high-pressure systems in North Korea and southern Japan, resulting in strong winds and heavy rain. Yesterday, the low-pressure system crossed Shanghai and entered North Korea and Japan. The torrential rain in Shanghai has stopped, but the wind force was still strong in the morning. Because there is a new high-pressure system to the northwest, following the low-pressure system, the Force 8 typhoon from the day before yesterday entered the sea, and a Force 4 wind took advantage of the situation and entered, but by the afternoon the high-pressure system had also crossed Shanghai. The weather is expected to improve within days. The Shanghai Meteorological Observatory's weather forecast is as follows:</p>

<p>Suit to Confirm Lease of Property Sold After Being Declared Enemy or Puppet Property Should Be Dismissed: Judicial Yuan Issues Unified Interpretation</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In Shanghai, some houses that were enemy or puppet property were confiscated by the government. However, because a third party had obtained the right to lease before the victory, this third party was affected after the confiscation, resulting in many disputes. Regarding this issue, the City Council had previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to transfer it to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. According to the Judicial Yuan's unified interpretation of the Law Conference, "Enemy or puppet property that has been confiscated and sold by auction by the auction agency, and the person who won the auction thereby obtains ownership, this right is actually originally acquired, and it is not based on the transfer of ownership from the original enemy or puppet property owner. Therefore, Article 423 of the Civil Code does not apply. If the original tenant files a lawsuit in court to confirm the continued validity of the original lease agreement, it should be considered unreasonable and rejected." (Note: Article 423 of the Civil Code states: "The lessor shall deliver the leased object to the lessee in a state suitable for the agreed-upon use and enjoyment, and shall maintain the state suitable for the agreed-upon use and enjoyment during the term of the lease relationship.")</p>

Now that I am employed by the Municipal Government, I can receive instruction from time to time. I know that my talent and knowledge are not shallow, and I will do my best in everything. All administrative policies of the Municipal Government should be based on the Mayor's intentions, and as a staff member, I will definitely act in accordance with the Mayor's instructions."

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, she returned to Shanghai and lived in Shanghai Art College, making a living by _painting. She went to Beiping in November of the same year, because Beiping's scenery is good, and I study landscape painting, so I went to Beiping to find good painting materials. She returned to Shanghai at the end of autumn in the 32nd year, and went to Tianjin, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other places in the 33rd year, all for painting. The indictment in court stated that she _ _ Chu Min_ was her father, and she knew the Japanese naval reporting minister Matsushima and Shiota, and supplied information to the enemy to question her. Answer: "That's not the case. I have always been in the occupied area. How could I know our military intelligence?" At this point, the court presented the Hankou City Police Department's reply to the defendant for review, which stated in part: "According to general rumors, Li has had a lot of interaction with Japanese people, but no concrete evidence can be provided." The defendant said: "Since there is no concrete evidence, how can you say that I am a traitor? I am an educated person who has received art education. Please give me legal protection from this kind of insult without facts."

<h3>Two Japanese War Criminals Tried for Abusing Allied Nationals; Hua Men and Eight Others Appear in Court to Testify; Defendants Deny and Are Ambiguous</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Japanese war criminals Odera Satoshi, former warden of the Allied Prisoner of War Camp on Haifang Road in Shanghai, and Honda Osamu, chief of general affairs, were given a preliminary hearing yesterday by the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. Eight British and American people who had been severely abused in the camp, including Hua Men, the former inspector of the Public Works Bureau, testified in court yesterday. It is said that after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese regarded the Allied nationals in Shanghai as prisoners of war and concentrated them in the Haifang Road camp, which was managed by Odera Satoshi and others. The amount of food for the 300 prisoners in the camp was only equal to the food for 30 guards. The prison had no cold protection equipment, and the winter temperature was often below zero. The hospital where sick prisoners lived was located near the storage of munitions, without regard to danger. During air raids, they were not concerned about the safety of prisoners and were not allowed to take refuge. The clothes and food sent to the prisoners by the International Red Cross were often confiscated and embezzled. Some prisoners were beaten. Various abuses were countless. In July 1945, all the overseas Chinese were transported to Fengtai, Hebei, and Odera Satoshi and others were still responsible for management. Sick and elderly prisoners could not be exempted from the transfer. The vehicles were crowded during the journey, and they stood continuously for more than ninety-six hours. The equipment and food in the Fengtai camp were even more unhygienic, so their health was greatly damaged. When questioned by the court, both defendants denied giving the prisoners less food. Regarding the confiscation of items sent by the Red Cross, they only admitted that they had refused to accept it once because they did not recognize the person sending the items. The others were also ambiguous. The case will be retried at a later date.</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Visits the Good Shepherd Convent: A Group of Helpless Girls Receive Spiritual Warmth</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It was an early summer afternoon with a touch of autumn, yet it brought the warmth of spring to one hundred and thirty orphaned and helpless girls. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by the General Secretary of the Catholic Welfare Committee, Father Mindrebo, and Mr. and Mrs. Ye Qiuyuan, the chief writer of this newspaper, visited the Good Shepherd Convent at the end of Hengshan Road. It is not entirely a girls' school nor an orphanage. It is a place specifically for the reception of unfortunate, orphaned, and helpless girls. There are underage girls, as well as women who have experienced life's hardships and fallen into prostitution. Thanks to the hard work of the nuns at the Good Shepherd Convent, some of these helpless people have received warmth, which has long moved Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, despite coming to Shanghai to treat a dental ailment, she took the time to make a visit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after leaving the doctor's clinic, Madame Chiang went to the Good Shepherd Convent on Hengshan Road. Needless to say, the nuns were already waiting at the door. The Good Shepherd Convent is an international organization, and its president in Shanghai is an American, currently in the United States. In addition, there are nuns from the United States, Canada, South America, France, and the Philippines. Their national style of life is one of "seeking alms," constantly begging in various places to support these helpless people. They welcomed this distinguished guest with utmost joy. They sang songs; Madame Chiang, with a motherly heart, gave them a brief address, urging them to learn from Jesus, serve the community, and pray more. She also had earnest conversations with them individually. Their innocence touched Madame Chiang. As the nuns accompanied Madame Chiang on a tour of the various departments, they even saw the kitchen. Madame Chiang was particularly interested in the cleanliness of the kitchen, believing it was due to the nuns' excellent teaching.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the nuns entertained Madame Chiang with tea and snacks in the reception room, Madame Chiang generously donated twenty bags of rice to them and promised to send them sweets and meat. This was only in terms of material support; the fact that Madame Chiang was able to visit them during her short stay in Shanghai was what gave them spiritual warmth. Madame Chiang stayed at the Good Shepherd Convent for an hour before leaving; however, that one hour warmed the hearts of a hundred and thirty people.</p>
<h3>Workers' Lives Should Be Improved: The General Labor Union Believes There Is No Reason to Restore Pre-War Salaries and Opposes the Uniform Discount Method for the Index</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Shui Xiangyun, the long-standing chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, spoke to our newspaper reporter yesterday, stating that since the cost of living index was unfrozen, various industrial trade associations and public utility associations have been petitioning everywhere, requesting that the wages of 1936 be restored as the base and that the current month's salary be paid according to the previous month's index, both of which are unreasonable. In 1936, workers earned only twenty or thirty cents a day, and their lives were inhuman. After the victory of the War of Resistance, how can workers not be allowed to improve their lives slightly? Paying salaries according to the previous month's index is even more in violation of the central government's intentions. Moreover, the unfreezing method stipulates that if factories are genuinely losing money, labor and management can negotiate to discount the index further. Workers have not expressed opposition to this, because workers are most aware of the profits and losses of their own factories and absolutely do not want their factories to close down and put themselves out of work. Mr. Shui said: Recently, he met with Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs in Nanjing, and yesterday he met with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Both ministers stated that the central government would never change its established policies, and factories with difficulties could negotiate individually. Mr. Shui further emphasized that the General Labor Union absolutely opposes the uniform index discount method for various industries. He said that there are many reasons why industry cannot be revitalized at present, and the industrial sector should focus on the big picture and request the government to solve difficulties such as raw material imports, lifting the dumping of foreign goods, industrial and commercial loans, etc., rather than haggling over wages.</p>
<h3>Index Dispute: Workers at a Liangjia Factory Stage Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the cost of living index was unfrozen, labor-management disputes have been continuous, and the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation work has been very busy. More than twenty factories in the printed silk industry previously had workers on strike, but they have now accepted advice and resumed work yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately summoned them for mediation. The dispute at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory was resolved the night before last. The factory's 15% allowance issued last year will be canceled from May, and May's salary will be paid at 23,500 times the index. The balance will be paid off before June 17th. The factory will resume operations, and the workers will return to work. In the silk weaving industry, Huanqiu, Xinfu, Wanchang, Yuandong, and four other factories are still slowing down work, while the rest have resumed work.</p>
<p>More than one hundred employees of the Jiuchang Silk Weaving Factory on Luban Road in the South City are demanding that their May wages be paid according to the index of 23,500 times, but the factory only agreed to 14,800 times. The workers started a hunger strike the day before yesterday, and the Social Affairs Bureau is sending personnel to mediate. Workers at the Qianghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Fanhuangdu Road demanded that their wages be adjusted to a base salary system based on the cost of living index, but they were unsuccessful. Moreover, the factory has not yet paid their May wages and June meal allowances, so the workers also started a hunger strike the day before yesterday. The Silk Weaving Industry Association of the Third District sent representatives to the General Labor Union yesterday to report the situation.</p>
<p>Unemployed workers at the Printing Department of the Zhonghua Book Company requested reinstatement of their jobs. The mediation was assisted by Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. The two sides did not reach an agreement and decided to talk again on the 12th.</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the 36th Anniversary of the Merchant Corps Comrades Association</h3>
<p>Gathering at the Hu She on the 15th</p>
<p>During the Xinhai Revolution, the Shanghai Merchant Corps participated in the encirclement of the Jiangnan Arsenal by the people’s army, capturing it in one fell swoop, thereby liberating Shanghai. Subsequently, a portion of the corps members participated in the attack on Nanjing, and then followed the army on the Northern Expedition, handling rear logistics work between Pukou and Xuzhou. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the corps members returned to their posts and continued their business. Unexpectedly, Yuan Shikai later usurped the country and, fearing the Merchant Corps as revolutionary elements, ordered his henchman Zheng Ruicheng, the Shanghai Garrison Commander, to forcibly disband it, and it disappeared. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the corps members, filled with joy, recalled the past and sought out old comrades. On June 16th of last year, they held a dinner gathering at the Cui Xiu Hall in the City God Temple and discussed organizing the Shanghai Merchant Corps Comrades Association for the Restoration of Shanghai during the Xinhai Revolution. More than 240 corps members attended, mostly elderly men. Participants at the time also included revolutionary elder Mr. Yu (President of the Senate) and Mr. Pan (Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council). Now, the council of the association has decided to hold the 36th anniversary commemoration meeting at the Hu She on Guizhou Road from 1:00 PM on the 15th of this month. Distinguished guests from the government and the public will be invited to a convivial meal, and a public memorial ceremony will be held for the late Governor Chen Qimei, who first visited the capital after the restoration of Shanghai, and the martyrs who died in the war. A special publication will be printed, briefly recording the facts of the restoration of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Upholding Amateur Sports International Amateur Athletic Association Congress Rejects Changes to Amateur Rules</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 9th] The amateur sports rules for the Olympic Games in London next year will not be changed. The International Amateur Athletic Association held a special meeting here today, attended by representatives from twenty-three countries, to discuss the issue of compensation for athletes' loss of time. As a result, it was decided to submit the case to the next congress held after the Olympic Games next year for reconsideration. The conveners of today's meeting were Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Iceland. The purpose was to determine that athletes could receive appropriate compensation for the time lost due to participation in competitions. However, after intense debate and opposition from American representative Avery Brundage, president of the American Olympic Association, the motion was submitted to the next congress in 1948 for reconsideration by a vote of twenty-nine to seventeen. Brundage refused to accept the position of vice president of the congress and protested against the convening of this congress. Brundage stated that this meeting was convened to discuss the issue of athlete compensation, which is completely illegal, violates the amateur rules, and will shake the foundation of the association. Congress President Sir Burghley stated that the amateur rules cannot be changed and must continue to be followed. The Dutch representative proposed that athletes participating in world, European, or international championships who are solely responsible for family living expenses may receive compensation not exceeding one pound or its equivalent value. The Swedish representative agreed to revise the rules so that some athletes could not sacrifice time due to economic reasons, so that everyone would have the opportunity to participate in sports competitions, which would be extremely fair. Brundage countered that this motion was completely illegal and stated that because representatives from South America, Central America, Asia, and the Far East did not participate, this issue should be left to the next congress for discussion. It was then put to a vote and passed for discussion at the next congress.</p>
<h3>Soviet Participation Issue</h3>
<p>The congress also approved Burma and Lebanon as members, while Iran, Jamaica, and Korea still need to fulfill certain conditions and comply with them. Regarding the Soviet Union issue, President Burghley stated that the membership application has been received, but procedures still need to be completed before approval. Some Soviet youth athletes have participated in professional competitions due to a misunderstanding of the true meaning of amateur rules. They should now be given the opportunity to participate in the Olympic Games. The Soviet Union's membership issue was approved and authorized to the board for decision.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Sales Move Cotton Cloth Sluggish</h3>

The maximum had been bid for 8.2 million. In the afternoon, because there were more asking prices from all parties and the stock market reported small, people's hearts became more empty, so it was unsustainable and declined, once hovering between 800,000 and 900,000. Finally, it closed at 8.6 million, a decrease of 400,000 compared to the previous day. Dongyang and other goods also fell along with it. 75-count Golden Chicken semi-gloss was still bid for 25 million, but no one asked about it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were very few factory-sourced transactions in the market, and the actual sales aspect was very slight, so the asking price trended weaker day by day.

Only six or seven packages of high-grade separately sourced silk were transacted, B-grade goods were priced at 24.5 million, C-grade goods were 200,000, D-grade goods were 4 million, and one or two packages of dried separately sourced silk were also transacted, priced at 17.5 million.</p>

Huaqiang quilt covers were bid at 8.9 million and sold, with a counter-offer of 800,000 but not transacted. It was heard that Dacheng plaid crepe sold for 34,200, and 100 in transit was transacted.

<h3>Market Rumors Abound, Chinese Stocks Fall More Than Rise</h3>
<p>Although Chinese stocks rebounded midway yesterday, due to fragile investor sentiment, they remained weak towards the close. Rumors were rampant, and the situation was unpredictable. When prices were high, there were rumors to encourage buying, and when they were low, negative news spread, causing the market to fluctuate wildly, rising and falling abruptly. It was difficult to grasp the trend, and trading volume remained low. As a result, declines outnumbered gains. At the opening this morning, the market rose briefly due to reports of a Sino-American loan agreement, but the large disparity with the previous day's National Bank quotes made investors nervous, and only a few transactions occurred. Deh Yong Yarn opened significantly lower. After the opening, No. 63, No. 85, No. 73, No. 123, No. 143, No. 223, and No. 117 recovered to 5330 yuan, but transactions in spot Deh Yong Yarn stopped at a low price of 5320 yuan.

No. 152, No. 186, No. 160, No. 206, and No. 148 were sold off, causing the price to fall back to 5450 yuan. With the replenishment from No. 152, No. 223, and No. 12, the price rose to 5650 yuan. No. 36, No. 105, No. 141, No. 76, No. 134, and No. 117 were settled. Deh Yong Yarn then fell again to below 5400 yuan. No. 104, No. 97, No. 112, No. 157, No. 134, No. 32, No. 83, No. 232, No. 65, and No. 224 all bought in. No. 231 and No. 104 even purchased spot Deh Yong Yarn.</p>
<p>At 11:10 AM, rumors circulated that a certain faction was turning bullish, and that the U.S. Securities Finance Corporation might offer financing. Deh Yong Yarn rebounded to 5820 yuan. No. 203, No. 236, No. 154, No. 153, No. 155, No. 76, and No. 218 reached within 5600 yuan. No. 223 and No. 16 took advantage of the low prices to buy in. Around noon, the market rose again, once rising to 5780 yuan. No. 106, No. 76, No. 157, No. 142, No. 68, and No. 131 settled their positions. Before the close, bullish traders were eager to settle, and there were rumors that a loan agreement would be reached soon.

<p>It is also reported that the new shares of the Second America Silk Factory after the capital increase will resume trading from the 12th of this month (Thursday), with 10,000 shares as a trading unit.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops Remain Stagnant, Market Weak in the South, Firm in the North</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to the impact of wind and rain, cargo ships were delayed en route, so yesterday's arrivals were slightly scarce. According to statistics, 4,010 shi arrived in the south market and 1,625 shi in the north market. There were more retail buyers and sellers in the market, but sales were mediocre, and the rice shops remained stagnant. The market was weak in the south and firm in the north. High-quality white japonica rice was priced at 400,000 yuan in the south market and 385,000 yuan in the north market. Early rice was priced at 395,000 yuan in the south market and 400,000 yuan in the north market.</p>
<p>Further reports: The rice market has been sluggish recently due to the approaching plum rain season. Prices in the interior are declining, and consumption is weak, making it difficult for the market to improve. The main reasons are that Sichuan is opening up, grain from Hankou is difficult to transport east, Jiangxi will open soon, and rice from Anhui is flooding into Shanghai, directly causing rice prices to fall. The tight money supply is also a factor.</p>
<p>The oil market has new cases emerging. Cooking oil consumption in the countryside has decreased. Green Bird and Yingkou continue to have sources of supply, gradually declining. Although flour has fallen sharply, manufacturers expect that 100,000 units of new flour must be imported in the future, so wheat flour continues to fall. Moreover, transportation in northern Jiangsu has resumed, and wheat production in northern Jiangsu is also a major component of Jiangsu Province. Future supplies are bound to flood in, so there is no concern about food shortages. Foreign rice is not included in the budget.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Foreign Indica Rice Being Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chen ship has already loaded over 7,000 tons of indica rice purchased by the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) in Rangoon for shipment to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive around the 20th. Furthermore, the company will dispatch the Hai Xuan ship from Shanghai directly to Rangoon at the end of this month to load over 9,000 tons of CNRRA indica rice for shipment to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Export Control Committee to Accommodate the Import of Wool with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, But Limited to Applicants Before April 17th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is learned that the head of the Quota Allocation Department of the Export Control Committee has recently been replaced, but internal operations are still proceeding as usual, and there are no other personnel changes. It is reported that the various quotas announced by the department for the first and second quarters are generally felt to be insufficient, especially for wool, paper, raw materials, and rubber. The extent of the shortage is even greater. The department is currently trying to accommodate wool importers who have self-provided foreign exchange and have applied for permission to import wool before April 17th of this year. However, applications after that date cannot be processed due to the regulations of the authorities. Regarding the allocation of rubber quotas, the department convened a rubber manufacturer consultation group meeting yesterday to discuss the issue. As a result, the manufacturers still failed to determine the allocation on their own and requested the department to allocate the quotas based on the first quarter allocation situation.

<h3>Cigarettes Apparently Firm, Actually Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market situation: At the opening, the market continued to be firm and high, and the number of resales in the market decreased. Demand from other merchants was higher, and the prices of various goods were raised across the board. Ten Large British cigarettes once rose to 6.7 million yuan. At the close, the footing was not solid, and sales occurred when the price fell back to 6.55 million yuan. Old Knife was 5.55 million yuan, Five Flowers was 4.45 million yuan, Beauty was 38,500 yuan, and Da Nan Wei was 90,000 yuan, all with supplies available.</p>
<p>The market softened further in the afternoon. In addition, the China Tobacco Company opened a distribution of 20 Quanlu cigarettes at a price of 12,000 yuan, Shuangfu cigarettes at 18,000 yuan per carton, Tianka cigarettes at two cases of Type A and one case of Type B, indicating ample supply. This tightened the financial resources of other merchants, and the market stagnated. As a result, the price of ten Large British cigarettes fell back to 6.58 million yuan, Old Knife was 5.535 million yuan, and Five Flowers was 4.43 million yuan. Compared with the previous day, Large British still rose by 230,000 yuan, Old Knife rose by 185,000 yuan, and Five Flowers rose by 180,000 yuan. The overall trend throughout the day was that only the Quanlu and Shuangfu brands fell more due to the distribution of goods, while most other cigarettes tended to be firm.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for daily necessities such as soap and matches saw an increase in prices due to the diligent replenishment of stocks and demand from local stores. In the end, the price of Gubben soap was 378,000 yuan per case, a continued increase of 8,000 yuan. Huang Xiangmao and Sunlight soap also rose by 15,000 yuan. Matches: Beauty was 2.63 million yuan, an increase of 30,000 yuan. New Phoenix rose by 50,000 yuan, New Brand Da Hua rose by 20,000 yuan, and the remaining brands were stable.</p>

<h3>Industry and Commerce Guidance Office Strengthens Investigation and Statistical Work</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the new Minister of Economic Affairs came to Shanghai for inspection, it was decided to strengthen the work of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, especially investigation and statistics. The Director of Statistics of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will come to Shanghai frequently in the future to coordinate with the Guidance Office. It is possible that the Ministry will transfer additional staff to Shanghai to increase manpower. It is learned that since the implementation of raw material rationing for imports, manufacturers have been assisting in the investigation work.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Tobacco Shipped from Hankou to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang An ship shipped over 3,000 bales of cotton and over 2,000 pieces of tobacco leaves from Hankou. The cotton was purchased and loaded by China Textile. In addition, the Hai Hu ship sailed directly from Shanghai to Shantou yesterday, carrying 2,800 pieces of peanut cake, 20,700 pieces of soybean cake, 110 pieces of textiles, and 25 pieces of cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>Local Timber Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The fir market remains soft, as inventories are still abundant. Improvement is unlikely before the holiday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Textile Thread Industry Association Established</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the Shanghai Textile Thread Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. More than 100 members attended, and Jiang Zaihua, Zhu Fuhai, Xie Qingbai, and 12 others were elected as directors. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Photoengraving Industry Association Appeals for Import of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The second quarter import quota has been announced by the Export Control Committee and is currently being allocated in detail. The photoengraving industry in Shanghai, due to a shortage of photographic materials and the Export Control Committee's refusal to allow imports, has appealed to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to request a solution from the Export Control Committee.</p>
<p>It is stated that there are 33 photoengraving factories in the city. Most of the equipment is outdated and rudimentary, making it difficult to reach standard levels. The main products are still comparable to foreign goods, but copper plates are significantly inferior to foreign products. Before the war, the industry could produce 2 million inches of plates per month, one-quarter of which was supplied to newspapers, one-quarter to the printing industry, and half to bookstores. Currently, the industry produces only 100,000 inches per month, only for newspapers and the printing industry. Based on the current situation, the industry needs 40 tons of zinc plate raw materials, 60 tons of copper plate raw materials, and various other materials such as sodium nitrate, iodine tablets, and film adhesives, all of which must be supplied by imports. It is hoped that the government can provide exchange settlement convenience. For those that have already been imported, it is hoped that the government will immediately settle the exchange. As for photographic materials, China is currently unable to manufacture them, and they must be ordered from foreign countries. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will allow the import of these materials within the quota.</p>
<h3>Liu Qingyi and Others Establish Huachang Silk Company</h3>
<p>China's entire silk industry rarely has large-scale organizations that handle both reeling and weaving. In the state-owned sector, there is only China Silk Company. In the private sector, there is also only China Silk Company. It is learned that Liu Qingyi, a leading figure in the Shanghai silk weaving industry, in view of this, has invited Zhuang Shuhao, Qu Yongzhong, Cai Xintao, Lin Xinnan, and other leading figures in the financial and silk weaving industries to raise 500 million yuan to establish Huachang Silk Company. Zhuang Shuhao was elected as chairman, and Cai Xintao, Qu Yongzhong, and Lin Xinnan were elected as standing directors. Liu Qingyi also serves as general manager. The general management office is located at 210 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai, and the factory is located in Ximen, Wuxi. The factory site is spacious, covering an area of five mu. The equipment is complete and equipped with 140 of the latest rotary reeling machines and Maoye-style silkworm raising machines, comparable in scale to China Silk Company. It also raised funds to set up purchasing stations in the silkworm producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to purchase over 1,000 dan of improved silkworm cocoons as raw materials for reeling high-quality raw silk. It also hired famous technicians to train workers in new technologies to achieve the goal of high quality and quantity. It is scheduled to start work in mid-month.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceuticals Weak and Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a violent wind and rain, and the market was quiet. In addition, with the approaching yellow calendar period, firms were releasing inventory, leading to a weak downstream market. However, foreign and Guang goods were quite firm due to exchange rate factors. Few visited the market yesterday.</p>
<h3>Government Will Provide Maximum Subsidies to Exporters to Break the Stalemate in Export Trade</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the emergence of a black market for foreign exchange, and the increasing divergence between the black market rate and the official exchange rate, export trade prices have gradually become incompatible, and recently have completely stalled. On the one hand, the government still needs to supply importers with foreign exchange at the official rate to import foreign goods. This has led to an increasing trade deficit and its contradictory procedures. In order to remedy this defect, Chinese import and export circles have advocated the implementation of an import and export linkage system. Foreign companies, on the other hand, mostly advocate restoring a free foreign exchange trading system. However, according to reliable sources, the authorities have carefully considered both suggestions and ultimately feel that there are difficulties in implementation. As a transitional measure, on the export side, the government will provide maximum subsidies to exporters, accept requests from exporters, and purchase export goods from the government, and then plan to centrally export them in order to break the current stalemate in export trade. At the same time, on the import side, the government will increase a certain amount of tax based on the nature and type of each imported product in order to compensate for the losses suffered by export trade.</p>

<h3>Iron Ox Plows the Soil: Tractor Completes Plowing Two Mu of Land in Half an Hour; Leveling Machine Benefits New Rural Construction</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 7th Quick Dispatch—Our Newspaper Dispatches Correspondent Rong Yusheng to Yuhang</p>
<p>Two months ago, the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) received tractors and leveling machines from the headquarters. Two months later, these tractors have already begun working on the barren land belonging to Yuhang County, arousing the interest of people from all walks of life in Zhejiang. Ba Yi, the Chief Executive Officer of the Taiwan Executive Office; Shen Honglie, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government; Zhejiang University; Zhijiang University; YMCA members; and colleagues from the press have all visited. They unanimously expressed their admiration for these scientific and industrial machines. At the invitation of Sun Xiaoji, the director of the Zhejiang Branch of CRRRA, the reporter set off towards Yuhang on a hot early summer day. Yuhang is a neighboring county of Hangzhou, and I have been there twice before. Once was during the war, when we were preparing to defend against the enemy. The other time was in July of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), during the recovery process. At that time, the road to Yuhang was filled with desolation, piles of broken walls and ruins, appearing desolate and dilapidated. The original vast forests had become swamps up to one's knees. This time, it was the second year after the victory, and along the way, there were still no signs of recovery. No new houses had been added, and no large areas of newly cultivated land were seen.</p>
<p>Approaching Yuhang, the car stopped beside the highway, where there were two mobile metal houses, separated by a fence into a courtyard. Two signs were hanging at the entrance: one read "Tractor Driving and Repair Training Class of the Zhejiang Branch" and the other read "Collective Farm of Yuhang County." First, we visited the equipment in the mobile metal houses, and then we looked at the tractor and leveling machine. The so-called tractor (originally named "Tractor") is a machine that uses an engine to tow various agricultural implements. Its body is like a car head, and it can be equipped with plows to plow the soil, iron rakes to rake the soil, and sickles to harvest crops. This machine is produced by Ford and manufactured by Ferguson. Similar machines were already in use in the United States long after the First World War. After the First World War, the United States exported this machine to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, based on the shortcomings of this machine after use, conducted research and improvements, and then the United States researched and improved it again, resulting in the current style. Originally, when this machine plowed the soil, if it encountered a large stone that it could not plow, the front of the car would become light and the rear would become heavy, causing it to overturn and even crush the driver to death. Now it is improved. He invented a mechanism. Two iron buttons are placed on the right side of the driver's seat. Just tap them with two fingers, and the plow, weighing several hundred pounds, will lift up, preventing it from being tripped by a large stone. Two plows can be towed behind the machine.</p>
<p>New Look of Work</p>
<p>When we visited, the ten tractors that had been transported were all working on the barren land. Some had only one plow attached to the rear, and a long iron bar for attaching the plow was raised, like a cow's tail, so the general farmers called it the Iron Ox. The Iron Ox plows very deep, more than a foot deep into the soil. After turning it over, it can also be raked loose, and then sown and fertilized. This machine cannot transplant seedlings because there is water in the fields when transplanting seedlings, and it cannot move. But if the seedlings have not been transplanted before irrigation, these Iron Oxen can fulfill the responsibility of plowing. At harvest time, when the fields are dry, these Iron Oxen can also fulfill the responsibility of harvesting. In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University purchased two of these machines and used them, but because of difficulties in repairing them and improper use, they were put aside and not used. Now all the repair parts for the "Iron Ox" are available, and there are also blacksmithing facilities. This blacksmithing facility also came from the United States. It uses a hand-cranked iron furnace, and the wind blows out, eliminating the need to use bellows like in China. At the same time, the hammer used in blacksmithing can also vary depending on the agricultural implements you need, unlike in China, where only one or two types of hammers are always used.</p>
<p>Another type is the leveling machine (originally named "Bulldozer"), which is specially used for pressing and leveling wet soil. It is used less often on cultivated land, but it is very useful for building new rural areas. This leveling machine is also suitable for building roads.</p>
<p>Encouraging Adoption</p>
<p>I asked the farmers about their interest in using tractors. One said, "This Iron Ox is really great. It can plow two mu of land in half an hour." I then asked a farmer who was working with a hoe not far from the mobile metal house if he thought there were any shortcomings in this method of cultivation. He sighed and said, "This method of cultivation is good, but I still use my own hands to cultivate because it is said that for the land cultivated by machine, the township office has to pay grain, two dou per mu if it is cultivated well and one dou per mu if it is cultivated poorly. It is still more cost-effective to cultivate by hand. Like this two mu of land, it takes twenty workdays, each workday is three sheng of rice, and each sheng of rice costs 3,500 yuan, which amounts to 210,000 yuan. But because it is wasteland reclamation, rent does not have to be paid for three years."</p>
<p>From this, we have found the crux of China's agricultural stagnation. We are a nation established on agriculture, and for thousands of years, we have been using human and animal power. We never think of using machines, nor do we study machines, and we even do not welcome machines. The reason for this is that our grassroots politics do not know how to promote it, but instead harm it! The principles of some of our Chinese agricultural implements and methods of manufacturing agricultural implements are not much different from those of modern Western advanced agricultural implements. The only difference is that there is no further research. Whoever does not let them research, whoever prevents new methods from being introduced into the countryside, this should be the responsibility of grassroots politics. We should encourage farmers to use methods of machine plowing like those in Yuhang! How can we levy extra grain payments? And the CRRRA does not want a penny from the local government.</p>
<p>Collective Farm</p>
<p>A senior staff member of the CRRRA who went with us said, "When we arrived in Yuhang, the county government convened a meeting. We asked if there were any organizations like cooperatives in the countryside. Who knew that the cooperatives were not in the countryside. We hoped that they would organize collective farms, but the barren land was distributed in fragmented pieces, making the work very difficult." Cooperatives need to penetrate into the countryside. We know that Yuhang must have cooperative organizations. Why can't the cooperatives produce results?</p>
<p>Talent Training</p>
<p>The CRRRA branch is now stepping up the training of talents in the use and repair of tractors. There are ten people being trained here, all with university degrees. Four are graduates of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, three are graduates of Yinda University, one is a graduate of the Horticulture Department of Jinling Experimental Agricultural Vocational School, and there are also two who did not graduate from Zhejiang University. They manage these machines, only provided with lodging, without salary, living a hard life in the countryside. In this era of declining morals and people's fondness for enjoyment, they delve into the countryside with a spirit of creation, which is truly admirable. We are delighted and happy to see them working hard and reclaiming barren land. In a time when the future seems bleak and gray, a glimmer of dawn is emerging because they have reclaimed more than a thousand mu of land.</p>
<h3>Seeing the Economic Trends of Overseas Minnanese from Remittances</h3>
<p>— Fuzhou, 7th Special Dispatch—Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu</p>
<p>Wherever the sun shines, there are footprints of overseas Chinese. Foreigners often use this sentence to highly praise China, and Chinese people also take pride in it. However, exactly how many overseas Chinese there are, China, being a country that does not keep statistics, has always lacked precise numbers. The reporter here humbly inquired from overseas Chinese leaders in neighboring countries or consulted relevant books and materials on overseas Chinese affairs. The more reliable statistics obtained, including various parts of Southeast Asia, Europe, America, Africa, Australia, Japan, and Korea, estimate that the total number of overseas Chinese is over 13 million (of which overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia account for more than 7.4 million). People from Fujian province account for one-third of the total. From this, the position of the Minnanese in the overseas Chinese community can be seen.</p>
<p>Fujian, because of the uniqueness of its geographical structure, had a long period of isolation from the Central Plains and a tendency towards overseas relations, forming a link in China's maritime commercial culture system. The Minnanese began migrating overseas in the Qin and Han dynasties, flourished in the Tang and Song dynasties. The first places they arrived at were the barren and undeveloped areas of Southeast Asia. Southeast Asians call overseas Chinese "Tang people," and New York has Chinatown. These are all remnants of the great migrations of that time. In the early Ming Dynasty, the Three Treasure Eunuch Zheng He sailed to Southeast Asia. Legend has it that many Minnanese followed him southward at that time, creating a trend for a time. At that time, Guangzhou and Quanzhou had already been opened as commercial ports for trade with various foreign countries, and sailing ships were as dense as weaving, with regular Southeast Asia ships. As a result of centuries of effort, the Minnanese have opened up a vast living space in Southeast Asia and have mastered considerable economic power. The remittances, which amount to a large sum of money every year, are tantamount to increasing the country's foreign exchange income.</p>
<p>Economic Reasons Predominate for Minnanese Going to Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Within Fujian, mountains are intertwined, and plains only account for 5-10% of the province's area, with less than 3,000 mu of arable land. With a population of more than 13 million, "there are many who leave and few who eat," and a large amount of rice and grain is imported every year. Therefore, the population of Fujian appears relatively excessive due to the shortage of arable land. Economic reasons force the Minnanese to "take an aquatic product, a set of clothes, a grass mat, and a carrying pole" and nothing else, and travel far to Southeast Asia. The famous New Fuzhou (originally named Sibu) reclamation movement in Sarawak in the 19th century was opened up by the people of Fuzhou. The iron bridge connecting Singapore to Johor was also built by the hard work of the Minnanese. The Minnanese have made immortal achievements in the prosperity of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The long voyage across the ocean requires brave and strong people to endure. Therefore, most of those who go to Southeast Asia are adults, usually between the ages of sixteen and thirty-five. Among the Minnanese, Haicheng, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Tongan, Nan'an, Hui'an, Xiamen, Shuangqing, and Gutian counties are the most numerous. Shishi in Jinjiang, Shishan in Nan'an, and Qiuyang in Haicheng are the largest overseas Chinese villages.</p>
<p>Minnanese Occupations are Mainly in Industry, Commerce, and Finance</p>
<p>The "social ladder" of the Minnanese in Southeast Asia is generally from workers, peddlers, shop assistants, and small shop owners to big businessmen. They use labor as capital, work diligently, and behave correctly, surpassing others in what they can do. They gradually infiltrate into the activities of various industries in Southeast Asia, and after a long period of hardship, they lay the foundation for their economic foundation. The businesses operated by more than 3 million Minnanese in various parts of Southeast Asia are mainly in industry, commerce, and finance, but they also vary depending on the location. Generally speaking, British Malaya focuses on the management of rubber, tin, coconut, pineapple, finance, and local product trade. Among them, the refined crepe rubber of Singapore enjoys a high reputation in Southeast Asia, and almost all of the operators of this industry are from Yongchun, Fujian Province. In addition, coconut oil and tin are almost all operated by the Minnanese, monopolizing the Southeast Asian market. The Minnanese in the Dutch East Indies mainly operate in petroleum, rubber, tea, sugar, coffee, tin, and coconut oil. Java is mainly engaged in manufacturing refined sugar, while Sumatra emphasizes both fishing and agriculture. The late sugar king Huang Zhonghan of Dutch Indonesia was a Minnanese. The Minnanese in French Indochina are mainly engaged in rice milling, medicinal materials, cotton industry, and rubber plantations. Although there are not many Minnanese in Indochina, they occupy a very important position in commerce. Vietnam is still mainly based on rice, tin, and rubber. Most of the Minnanese in the Philippines are retail merchants, mainly dealing in rice, timber, and cosmetics. One foreigner estimates that three-quarters of the commercial credit in the entire Philippines is controlled by the Minnanese. In 1933, their total investment in the Philippines reached 100 million British yuan. The enterprises operated by the Minnanese in Southeast Asia include rubber factories such as Chen Jiageng's, Yong An Tang of Hu Wenhu, alcohol factories of Huang Yizhu, and countless other business organizations. The Minnanese really occupy the "economic throne" of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Huge Remittances Strengthen Foreign Exchange Reserves</p>
<p>Usually, international investment must first have a "capital expenditure" before there can be "business profit income." However, the capital of the enterprises established by overseas Chinese overseas is the accumulation of labor, and there is no actual expenditure for the motherland. Instead, it pays huge amounts of international income. The role of remittances in the national economy is even greater than the significance of encouraging exports because the former is only the payment of labor. Before the war, the amount of remittances every year was quite large, and its contribution to making up for the motherland's import surplus was indispensable. According to relatively reliable statistics in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), including any form of remittance and the property (including donations) brought back to the country by overseas Chinese themselves, the annual amount reached 200 million yuan (the remittances of official or group banks only accounted for about one-tenth of the above). From this figure, we can see the economic status of the Minnanese overseas.</p>
<p>When the Pacific War broke out, remittances were cut off, and the economic strength of the Minnanese in the south was greatly restricted.</p>
<p>In the early days of victory, because the Minnanese were just beginning to recover and were restricted by the strict restrictions of the governments of their places of residence on remittances, remittances were still not smooth. Until April of last year, the Minnanese gradually established contact with their relatives in their hometown, and remittances were restored. According to the statistics of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and the Fujian Provincial Postal Administration, from April to the end of last year, the total amount of remittances received in Fujian Province was more than 8 billion yuan. In addition to the 3.5 billion yuan remitted through the Postal Administration, the amount remitted by the Xiamen Zhongxing Bank was the largest. According to the China Bank report in January and February of this year, the remittances received were approximately 1.2 billion yuan. According to people in the overseas Chinese community, remittances through national banks only account for one or two-tenths of the actual remittances. Most of the remittances are remitted through private remittance agencies because the remittance fees of these agencies are much lower than those of national banks. If we add the various valuable securities and property brought back to the country by a large number of overseas Chinese themselves, we can see that the number of remittances since the victory is still quite considerable. There is also a superstition popular among the overseas Chinese in southern Fujian that every time they send a family letter, they have to attach some money, otherwise, it is considered unlucky. Such sporadic remittances are especially impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>Using Overseas Chinese Capital to Create New Environments and Increase Profits</p>
<p>The lessons learned by overseas Chinese in this war were profound. In addition, the discrimination of indigenous ethnic groups against Chinese has changed the overseas Chinese's concept of "Golden Southeast Asia." Since the victory, according to the statistics of the overseas Chinese affairs agencies here, the number of Minnanese returning to the country is more than 50,000, and the total number of those going abroad is less than 15,000. From this, it can be seen that the Minnanese have gradually increased their centripetal force towards the motherland. This is a good opportunity to absorb overseas Chinese capital. The inflow of overseas Chinese capital into Fujian has a decisive effect on improving the current situation of Fujian's huge import surplus and the prosperity of the local social economy. However, the inflow of overseas Chinese capital must create an environment for the possibility of using overseas Chinese capital; otherwise, even if overseas Chinese capital flows in, it may not help local construction. For example, the relatively wealthy overseas Chinese villages in southern Fujian have a large amount of funds that have nowhere to go. Recently, it has been popular to welcome gods and raise money to build ancestral halls, spending millions of yuan, competing for novelty and wealth, without the slightest stinginess, or using funds to move to high-interest loans, aggravating the rural crisis. There is very little interest in business investment. This time, the Minnanese, led by Hu Wenhu, formed the Fujian Economic Construction Company. Looking at the situation, they are still unable to invite an enthusiastic response from overseas Chinese in various places. Therefore, the progress of raising funds is slow. According to the results of the reporter's contact with the overseas Chinese leaders here, it seems that overseas Chinese feel that the government cannot provide favorable conditions for returning to the country to invest and have concerns, such as uncertain economic goals, the lack of transportation conditions, and the lack of appropriate guarantees and convenience.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese, as the mother of the Chinese revolution, have an excellent revolutionary tradition. For example, most of the Fujian patriots among the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang lived in Southeast Asia. They love their motherland more than the people in the country, and their financial resources are indeed stronger than those of the people in the country. During the Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese actively contributed in manpower and financial resources, giving great help to the Anti-Japanese War. In the future, the cause of national construction will also need this strong economic force.</p>
<h3>Ten Days in Southern Yunnan: Prospects for Gejiu Tin Industry</h3>
<p>— Kunming, 2nd Air Dispatch—Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Xu Jilian</p>
<p>The main tin producing area in our country is Gejiu in southern Yunnan. Others include Fuchuan and He County in Guangxi, Hechi, Nandan, Debai, Jianghua in Hunan, Linwu, Yidan, Liuxian, Changning, Guiyang, Dabian, Nankang, Ganxian in Jiangxi, Dianbai, Jieyang in Guangdong, Hainan Island, and areas near Kukeqe in Xinjiang. Although each has its own output, none of them are as far as Gejiu.</p>
<p>Source is Granite, Located on Top of Plateau</p>
<p>Gejiu, known as the Tin Capital of China, was developed very late. The history before the Yuan Dynasty is no longer traceable. It is located in the southern part of Yunnan Province, west of the Zhenyue Railway, 1,800 meters above sea level. Except for tin, all other necessities of life and materials used in the factory area are supplied from other places. Therefore, there is a saying that "burning firewood without seeing trees, eating rice without seeing bran." Precisely because of this, Gejiu has become a place where people from all directions gather, and everyone only cares about profit. The so-called "emphasizing money and despising virtue, not hearing of courtesy, frugality, gentleness, and goodness" can be used as the best portrayal.</p>
<p>The origin of Gejiu tin can be divided into three main branches: The first branch originates from Panshan, which belongs to Jianshui, winds south to Laoyang Mountain in Gejiu, extending for hundreds of miles until it reaches the Honghe River bank. The second branch connects from Zhadian eastward to Laoyin Mountain in Gejiu. The third flower originates from the Qilin Mountain area in Tibet, connecting Wafangchong, Poshanchun, Songshujiao, and Gushan factory areas, covering an area of more than a hundred square miles.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of tin veins, some experts have also conducted investigations, stating that the source of Gejiu tin is granite, mostly located on the top of the plateau. The area near the mining area is mostly distributed with limestone, and the main mining areas are mostly in the eastern part of the plateau, with the Laochang, Malage, and Wafangchong areas being the richest. Laochang has the largest area and can be divided into six small areas: Huangmaoshan, Haozimiao, Shuzijie, Huazhakou, Yindong, and Laoyinchang.</p>
<p>Mining of Yunnan Tin Ore Began in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties</p>
<p>The history of tin mining in Yunnan has never been recorded in detail. However, the discovery of Yunnan tin probably dates back to the Han Dynasty. There may have been mining in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. By the middle of the Qing Dynasty, the price of tin rose, and after the opening of the Dianyue Railway in the 23rd year of Guangxu (1897), the factory situation gradually became prosperous. Since the Republic of China, those who run factories have sprung up like mushrooms. The factory affairs are becoming more and more developed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, good times do not last long. The prosperity of Gejiu did not last long. First, the persecution of war caused a great discount in work and production, and the blockage of transportation caused problems in transportation and export. For example, foreign equipment and machinery could not enter this area. People are shouting about using new methods every day, but scientific production methods cannot be separated from the use of machines. Heavy things cannot be moved in. Furthermore, the application for foreign exchange takes a long time, so it is often impossible to buy the necessary equipment for production. How can one seek improvement in production methods in this way? It is simply a matter of great difficulty!</p>
<p>Three-Year Revival Plan, Too Many Obstacles in the Environment</p>
<p>The Yunnan Tin Industry Company also formulated a three-year revival plan. The design was very thoughtful, but how many difficulties were there in implementation? The company is willing to use machines as much as possible and is willing to cooperate with manufacturers to promote the revival of the entire tin industry. However, in fact, there are many unexpected obstacles that greatly discount their confidence. Moreover, due to the suspicion and jealousy of the manufacturers, the plan cannot be implemented smoothly. In the three-year plan, the Tin Industry Company plans to add an aerial cableway of ten kilometers from Gejiu to Laochang to achieve time-saving and labor-saving results. It can transport 500 to 1,000 tons of ore per day. Secondly, the Xiaolongtan Power Plant must be established as soon as possible, and then the problem of refining will be solved. Finally, there is the plan to strengthen the smelting of ore in tin factories, aiming to reach 300 to 500 tons per day.</p>
<p>If the plan cannot be implemented, it will often become an empty slogan. The Gejiu tin industry revival plan unfortunately encountered this situation. Until now, it has not been able to realize even a small part of the plan. The person in charge sighed and said, "The environment is like this, and there are many difficulties. What good way can be used to break the current deadlock?" Indeed, the power of the individual is so small!</p>
<p>We have also said that Gejiu, apart from tin, is a place where nothing else can be produced. Precisely because of this, if the tin industry in Gejiu cannot be revived, it will not only affect the livelihoods of the people in southern Yunnan but also be a huge loss to the entire Yunnan. Expanding the scope further, it may not be without impact on China's export trade. Therefore, many people are concerned about the future of the Gejiu tin industry.</p>
<p>A Seminar to Discuss the Future of Gejiu Tin</p>
<p>The Tin Industry Company attached great importance to our journalist visiting group. They specially invited local related personnel to hold a very meaningful seminar. Everyone provided many opinions, and everyone had fervent hopes for the future of Gejiu tin. Huang Yuanzhi, the Speaker of the County Council, is a shrewd and capable elderly man. He raised his voice and pointed out the current crisis of the Gejiu tin industry. Of course, the mining of metal mines cannot be done without a large amount of capital, and the fundamental problem of the current Gejiu tin mining is the lack of capital. Therefore, they appealed to the Four Joint Offices to organize tin loans as soon as possible. After thousands of calls, only 1.5 billion yuan was approved, which is a limited number in the eyes of Gejiu tin merchants. Moreover, it is issued in installments, which seems to be a drop in the bucket, and the distant water cannot save the near fire. Speaker Huang shouted loudly, what is needed is the most abundant goods? Executive Manager Lu said more specifically: If the government can provide low-interest loans and continue to lend for three years, there will be no problem in producing 10,000 tons of tin per year. Now, they are requesting that the loan amount be increased to 15 billion yuan. Whether this loan can be successful is a major key to whether China's tin industry can be revived and whether it can gain a place in the world market in the future.</p>
<h3>Poetry</h3>
<p>— Shen Xianyuan] A poet who can create poems that span the universe is not a conjurer who turns a startled horse into a dragon steed, but one who controls the dragon steed with his own wisdom, making its hooves, which rise to chase the wind, gallop like cloud-piercing feathered arrows. It is most tragic for a person to merely envy or be jealous of others' good fortune in obtaining such a fine steed, while forgetting to hone his own horsemanship.  Inscribed on Zhang Daqian's Painting for Zhu Danlin's Fiftieth Birthday  Shen Yinmo  Green branches and red leaves in the clear autumn sky, I walk with a new plan, leaning on my staff; Could it be that I know my errors like Qu Boyu, or perhaps I meet Yuanming under the pines.  Impromptu Verse for Zhang Daqian's Portrait of Danlin by Yaguang  Shen Yinmo  The scenery south of the mountains is ever new, See him reciting poetry at ease; Entrust the inspired brush to bearded Zhang, A branch of red tree reveals a rich spirit.  Flying Waterfall at Stone Trough  Yu Jianhua  Mount Tiantai spans hundreds of miles, with countless peaks, but the most important is the Stone Beam Flying Waterfall. Above the precipice, a waterfall plunges down, asking where it comes from; above the waterfall, a stone beam spans horizontally, about fifteen feet long, just wide enough for a foot. Travelers are often frightened and daunted, looking on with awe.  Drinking by A. Cowley Translated by Zhen Qin  The parched earth swallows the rainwater, and still opens its mouth for more; The trees drink water from the soil, drink without end, and so remain ever fresh; The ocean (one might think: the ocean has little need to drink) sucks up ten thousand rivers, full to overflowing. The hurried sun (as can be seen from its drunken, fiery face) drinks the seawater deeply; when it is drunk dry, the moon and stars come to drink the sun: they dance and drink in their own light. They drink and make merry all night long. In nature, nothing is purely sour, yet everywhere is eternal health. Well then, pour a cup full and high! Fill all the cups—please tell me, if everyone else can drink, why can't I! Tell me why? You moralists! [A. Cowley (1618-1667), an English poet and Doctor of Medicine. Dr. Johnson's "Lives of the Poets" begins with Cowley. Though little known to later generations, Macy's "The Story of World Literature" (translated by Hu Zhongchi, Kaiming Press) holds him in high esteem. This poem "Drinking" is one of the author's masterpieces, its bold style comparable to Liu Ling's "Ode to the Virtue of Wine" in our country. --Translator]  Night of June by Victor Hugo Translated by Zuo Hong In summer, when the day has just passed, the flower-covered plain spreads a intoxicating fragrance afar; He closes his eyes, half-closing his ears to the clamorous sounds, he is only in a hazy sleep. The stars are extraordinarily bright and clean, the shadows more beautiful; A vague dawn dyes the semi-circular sky; And that warm and ashen-grey dawn, waiting for its time, The whole night seems to linger in the lower reaches of the sky. (Written in 1839)  An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 531 Ye Jingfeng "That way of putting it is also possible..." I searched through my barren mind, trying to find a simple way to explain to him "...Do you understand the words 'premonition'?" I asked Tsurumi. "I understand the general meaning, but not the specialized definition." "Everyone has premonitions. The formation of this premonition is originally the result of what science calls the 'law of cause and effect.' For example, if you aim a stone at someone's glass window, you can certainly guess the result that will occur. But for us humans, human affairs are extremely complex, and every action inevitably sows a 'cause,' but there are too many of these causes thrown out, and the time distance from cause to effect is sometimes too long, a week, a month, or even ten years, and you have long forgotten the shadow of this 'cause'; of course, you don't know that this 'effect' will eventually come about. Although you have forgotten the shadow, there is an internal function that always remembers it for you, and that is your 'subconscious.' This subconscious sometimes reminds you in your sleep, sometimes in broad daylight, or when you are sober, it warns you 'The cause you planted at such and such a time and place is now about to bear fruit!' This is 'premonition'..." "But this premonition, this kind of warning, ordinary people, especially those who are poor and indulgent, will absolutely not be aware of it. Only those who are pure of heart and have few desires can sense a little. But experts who have cultivated mental unity can have premonitions. So I say that Pingzi's words are also possible..." "As for what novels call 'a sudden impulse,' 'heart pounding' and other expressions indicating that misfortune is about to befall, it's just that some of them are exaggerated and too mythologized. However, it cannot be said that it is completely untrue. Fortunately, in the newspapers and magazines published today, there are often reports of this kind of fact, as long as you pay attention a little, you can collect a lot of evidence with basis..." "Okay, old brother, let me come and visit you as a teacher when I have time in the future, and study with you... Now there is another question, stuck in my heart, what do you think—what do you say is the effect of this trick I played in Shanghai this time?" "This is like when Jiang Gan crossed the river that day, and Cao Cao fell for the trick, which can only deceive for a short time... I think as early as a week, and as late as a month, these Japanese troops will be restless again. You think, their situation at this time is like horses being fed and weapons being sharpened, like an arrow on the string, how can they delay for long?" "There is one more thing, until now, so many heroes and talents in Shanghai, including the Elder Jue of the Bai Ren Manor and the think tank, no one has interpreted the meaning of that strange character '0915,' you...?" "This has nothing to do with wisdom or learning. The day before yesterday, I received a report from Zheng Yan about your affairs in Shanghai, and I told Mr. W about this mystery of '0915' at the time, but I didn't get an explanation. Last night, their captain Dai came back, and everyone mentioned this matter again, and Mr. Dai was also confused, but his Western secretary, Mr. Ma, suddenly thought that he had read a paper in a Western magazine, and only then did he know that '0915' meant 9:15 AM. In the time terminology of the European and American armies, the twenty-four hours of a day and night are recorded without distinguishing between AM and PM: 9 AM is '09,' and 9 PM is '18'." "Ah, I understand, so that strange note originally called us to go to the Hua Mao Hotel at a quarter past nine... Wasn't Pingzi coincidentally rushing there at ten past nine, and accidentally fell into Matsu's trap..." Tsurumi had just said this when the big guy "04" rushed in in a panic, saying that Mr. W upstairs had received two top-secret telegrams from Panyang and Yaoqun, asking us to go upstairs to talk... (End of this chapter)  The Fake Braid (Part Two) Feng Zikai I cut my braid when I was fifteen years old, and I have seen fake braids. In front of people under the age of forty (those over forty must have forgotten), I can boast a little. This is a braid made of false hair, attached to the back of the hat. When the hat is worn, it is impossible to tell the truth from the false. But never take off your hat. There are two kinds of people who wear fake braids: one is people who have returned from foreign countries, and the other is people who have had their braids cut off for adultery. Fake foreign devils belong to the first kind. When I was a child, there were both kinds of people in my hometown. Belonging to the first kind was Mr. Yu in the elementary school. He was hired from another village to teach English and singing. He had studied in Japan and cut off his braid. After returning to China, people would point and laugh at him on the street, and people would often shout "Wife of a foreigner!" behind his back. Therefore, he wore a fake braid to avoid trouble. At that time, "Xiangyang" soap had just appeared in my hometown, and people would put it in a bag and hang it on their lapels as a perfume sachet. But Mr. Yu actually used Xiangyang soap to wash his feet. This matter was widely spread throughout the town, and everyone thought that this person was "not good for anything." Most likely, his braid had been cut off for stealing a wife, and it was not necessarily cut off because of studying abroad. Sure enough, he was soon unwelcome in Shimenwan, packed his bags, and dragged his fake braid to another village. Belonging to the second kind was Rotten Dirty Er. He was a hooligan in my hometown, and his name came from the saying "remove the rotten dirty." One can imagine what kind of person he was. Rotten Dirty Er was a philanderer with a married woman. The woman was beaten badly by her husband and tried to commit suicide. The husband and the people in the area caught Rotten Dirty Er, stripped both him and the dead body naked, tied them together with ropes, and locked them in an empty room. This was during the hot summer weather. When they were released after three days, Rotten Dirty Er had not died, but his whole body was covered with rotten flesh and maggots, and he was also missing a braid. Rotten Dirty Er wore a fake braid because he was afraid of hindering his wrongdoing. He wore a hat even in summer. There was another person named Zhong Qinghe, who was also a hooligan, so he was on good terms with Rotten Dirty Er. The two often teased each other. When Rotten Dirty Er saw Zhong Qinghe, he would greet him loudly in public: "Qinghe, have you eaten yet?" But when he said this, he would pinch his nose and pronounce the two words "Qinghe" as "eat dirt," so the whole sentence would become: "Eat dirt (in my hometown, calling poop dirt) have you eaten yet!" Everyone would laugh. Qinghe would endure this ridicule without saying a word, then rush over and lift his hat, taking the fake braid off with it. Everyone would laugh again. Qinghe wanted to throw the hat and braid onto the roof, and Rotten Dirty Er would kneel down and beg for forgiveness. Only then would the play end. This is very similar to the material in Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q." Now, because of answering the question about fake braids, I have been able to relive my childhood dreams. Written on June 5, 1947 in Hangzhou. Free Talk Hangzhou Should Learn from Switzerland Dongliu Hangzhou has long been known as "China's Little Switzerland." This is not without reason. In terms of the way it attracts tourists and the prosperity of the market due to the large consumption of tourists, the two are quite similar. In March and April, the spring sunshine is beautiful, and the West Lake is at its peak. The number of tourists is indeed unmatched by other scenic spots. This spring, I myself was quite distressed by entertaining guests, spending time and money was a minor matter, but accompanying guests to repeatedly tour "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" and the like was not interesting after all. Any famous scenic spot, if it once has the obligation to be "must-see", the feeling of disgust reflected in the hearts of these tourists can be imagined. Hangzhou attracts so many tourists, spends a lot of their money, and even wins the reputation of "being good at creating cucumber tricks". In theory, Hangzhou's public welfare undertakings should be comparable to the village of Altdorf at the foot of Mount Klausen in the Swiss scenic area, but it is not. In Hangzhou, the only ones who benefit from tourists are temples, nunneries, hotels, restaurants, tea houses, small shops selling local products, beggars..., the general public can only cry out in pain due to the price wave caused by tourists. In addition, the city government's tax revenue has increased a little, which is also a good phenomenon. But then let's see what the situation is like in the Swiss village of Altdorf? The following is Mr. Xiao Qian's report: More than 300 years ago, a major black plague broke out in southern Germany. People died everywhere in Altdorf. So the villagers made a wish to heaven, saying that every ten years the whole village must perform a season of cautionary religious plays. At first, this move was purely religious, like Mount Miaofeng and Mount Putuo, but because world tourists gathered from all over the world every time this drama festival was held, this devout move inevitably became tainted with commercial color. Wood carvings had a world market, and hotels attracted tourists, but the income from the drama festival was always used exclusively for public welfare. This once-a-decade event built hospitals, schools, and swimming pools for Altdorf. At this point in the report, I seem to hear Mr. Xiao Qian sigh, saying: "There is still one that is better than our Hangzhou. This medieval village retains its original simplicity and beauty. There are no villas for important people - at least no houses that look like villas for important people. All the buildings are harmonious and appropriate." There are many people in the world who enjoy the beautiful and happy lives of Bai Letian and Su Dongpo. I grew up in Hangzhou since I was a child, so naturally I would never ignore the scenery in front of me. However, in addition to appreciating and viewing, Hangzhou should also have its own characteristics. Due to the beauty of the West Lake, it attracts many tourists every year and imports a large amount of legal tender, making the Hangzhou market appear very "prosperous" once a year. However, this situation does not last long, and tourist consumption only helps a portion of the "favored ones." Like Switzerland, it is impossible to propose taking some of it to run public utilities. In Hangzhou, just like other parts of China, the villas of the nobles and the beggars sleeping in the open air are in direct proportion. Seeing a corner of red tiles and a white wall peeking out from the excellent scenic spot always makes people feel uncomfortable. Why? It is because of the bloody and non-universal prosperity hidden behind the villa. As a scenic spot, Hangzhou is beautiful and quiet, but we hope that most Hangzhou people should make good use of the income from the incense season and put more effort into public welfare, so that Hangzhou will not only become a beautiful scenic spot, but also the center of academic culture in Southeast China.  Supporting Good People Mengping It is reported that Shanghai celebrities established the Shanghai Social Security Promotion Association in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Its purpose is to "uphold justice, support good people, in order to achieve political integrity, economic prosperity, social security, and national prosperity, so that everyone has work to do, food to eat, freedom, and happiness, and there is no unemployment, no hunger, no plunder, and no terror." The purpose of this association is aimed at reality and can be said to be an unprecedented example for various other associations. High officials and nobles have said these words and shouted these voices, which shows the seriousness of today's social situation. We ordinary people are really leaping with joy and celebrating the future of the country. Good people serve with sincerity and will not deceive or be opportunistic. Good people will abide by the law and will not be greedy or plunder. In today's society, good people dare not speak, are unwilling to speak, and do not want to speak. Speaking directly is afraid of offending people, and speaking directly is useless. Tigers and lions cannot move their hair. As a result, some are silent, some eat their fill all day long, and some struggle with hunger. The country and society are left to evolve on their own. Mr. Pan Gongzhan believes that "the urgent work today is to purify politics and transform society," and I feel the same. But those in power must have the determination, must have the revolutionary spirit, restrain the capital of powerful families, and save the economic crisis. The Shanghai Social Security Promotion Association was born at this time, and we give it unlimited sympathy and expectations.  Looking at Modern Morality from the Case of Filicide Tang Shan Recently, a case of filicide occurred in the capital: a son stabbed his biological father to death with his own hands. The reason was that the father did not allow the son to have promiscuous relationships with girlfriends. If this had happened in the previous dynasty, not only would the murderer have been punished by the law, but even the local officials would not have escaped responsibility. Now, this is just a piece of news in the newspaper. Although it is news, it seems to be valued by people. The news has been expanded and framed, and special dispatches and communications have been reported together. What is the reason for the importance? The focus is still on "filicide." Recently, we have often seen reports in the newspapers of sons beating their fathers, fathers stealing their daughters-in-law, and even mothers and sons committing incest. People with a conscience have to sigh that the world is going downhill from a moral point of view. Really, if such relationships are not distinguished and everything is messed up, what kind of human society will it become? Some people feel that to save China, morality must be saved first. Without the revitalization of morality, no crisis can be overcome. This may be reasonable, but it cannot help the facts. It has not seen through the essence of the problem. In modern times, the relationship between parents and children is mixed and sparse to the point of hatred. Why has the moral code of ethics fallen to this point? This is naturally not a problem of morality itself. Times have changed, and moral concepts have naturally changed with them. Morality is an abstract thing, and the social behavior and economic conditions support this concept. Moral concepts are different under feudal societies and democratic societies; moral standards of the bourgeoisie and the common people are also different. This explains that morality has temporality. Let's talk about this case of filicide. Because Boss Jin was engaged in construction projects, his family was very rich. He only knew about his business relations and took a laissez-faire attitude towards his son. The young Jin boy lived comfortably and did not care about anything. The moral basis between them was established on the relationship of money. This is like the two parties of labor and capital, each standing against each other for the interests of the class. Now the father suddenly feels that this kind of "credit loan" will be shaken, and he wants him to obtain a solid guarantee; but the other party happens to be an empty-headed expert, so the rupture is inevitable. Some people say: The rebellious son is a middle school student. The occurrence of this kind of filicide can also be said to be the bankruptcy of moral education. But you have to know that young Jin boy was not originally studying. He was a student who only cared about paying fees. The current morality of the education sector is only this kind of monetary relationship. You have paid the fee and registered, and you are considered a student of this school. As for you having promiscuous relationships with girlfriends outside and not going to lectures, that does not matter much. Under the system of money-based society, although the name of father and son exists, the face of morality is completely different. The indulgence of children in rich families and the oppression of children in poor families both cause the relationship between parents and children to deviate from the path of "love." The disaster of filicide lies in this. In the process of the new and old morality, we sigh "the demise of morality" and "the hearts of the people are not as good as they used to be," which is all superfluous.  Film Talk "Welcoming Spring Melody" Wubian "Welcoming Spring Melody" is a work with realistic themes. It does not tempt the audience with "pornography" or "espionage." This is a rare work among the many domestic films recently released. The author writes about the life of an old person in a commoner district with simple and unadorned brushstrokes. In this building live painters, musicians, poets, prostitutes, young shop assistants, purple women, old women on their deathbeds, and the loan sharking landlady. They are bullied and humiliated, and there are also people who exploit others. In short, the author uses a sketch-like style to outline a corner of the current society. This group of people who are bullied, humiliated, and living in the cold current is a true reflection of today's sufferers. They struggle in life and yearn for warm and sunny days. However, the author did not tell them when the cold current could pass, or how spring could come. He only let them wait and, at most, welcome it. In fact, this is very passive. Obviously, the author's focus is on the three artists, plus the prostitute, to form this story. But the living circles of these three artists are too narrow. They do not come into contact with more reality, and others do not understand the "words" they are accustomed to using. It can be said that they do not understand them, and even they themselves admit that this is the sorrow of intellectuals. In fact, this is not the sorrow of intellectuals, but the sorrow of these three "artists" who live in small circles. Among these three people, the musician is doing the job of a foreign instrument ghost, the poet is hawking his poetry collection everywhere, and only the painter is fantasizing about creating great works. Without real life, apart from finally seeing him painting a leaf on the wall for the prostitute who is sick, he has done nothing else. This character occupies the most important position in the story. In addition, although the prostitute has lost her husband and children, she has no family burden and relies on herself to solve the life of one person. After she meets the three artists, there is no change in her life, and none of the three people arrange another kind of life for her - not even offering suggestions. Does this show that the prostitute is resigned to her fate, or that she is unconcerned about the humiliation of others? The concern between people cannot be just some empty platitudes, there must be concrete facts. At least now it seems that this prostitute is consciously moving towards depravity. Although this script has these shortcomings, it is still a better work at present. For example, the cart of the street vendor Ah Fa is confiscated, and he even sells his own blood to exchange for the cost of living. The old woman on her deathbed dreams of her son who has been on the expedition for eight years returning. These are all profound and moving. Among the actors, Hu Feng's prostitute and Fan Lai's Ah Fa are the best, natural and vivid. Jin Yan's acting skills are extremely stable, but he lacks a little inner psychological creation. Pei Chong's role is more pleasing, and his efforts can also be seen. In terms of directing achievements, this play is better than any of Wu Yonggang's past plays.  Thoughts on the Tram Fare Increase Xu Qin The tram and bus fares have been increased on the ninth of this month. This matter, for a part of people who are forced by livelihood, at least it cannot be denied that it is a kind of threat. In principle, since the cost of living index has been unfrozen, it is inevitable that the tram and bus fares will increase; moreover, some people think that the small amount of the increase is not a problem. However, although this is the reason, they have forgotten those who are in another kind of environment. The prices of things increase, and the salaries are added, probably in many institutions, it is probably like this. However, if you think about it carefully, you will know that there are many places where this is not the case. For example, in some small-scale shops, the salaries of their employees will not be increased according to the "cost of living index" at all. Again, it is a part of private elementary school teachers, their salaries, compared to the former, are exactly the same. Therefore, the increase in tram and bus fares, although small in number, is actually a great stimulus for them. As a person in a clean and noble position, before the cost of living index was unfrozen, the salary was pitifully small (because I am forced to travel far, I take the tram every day; after deducting the fare, there is very little left). However, at present, this number remains unchanged. Now that the tram and bus fares have increased, it seems that even the tram and bus will not be able to afford it! Hey, I don't know if this is sad or regrettable.  Record of a City in Crisis Qin Shouou It was almost three or four o'clock in the afternoon again. After being extremely exhausted, Zhu Zhaonian took a short nap, but thinking about the car, thinking about Feifei, thinking about Lan, he quickly woke himself up again; he opened his tired eyes and immediately busied himself with looking at Feifei, who was lying in his arms. He found that the child seemed to be breathing heavily, her face was also much paler, and her eyes looked lifeless like a fish out of water. "Feifei, do you want to drink water? Are you tired?" he asked in a low voice. "Headache, Uncle Zhu, Feifei has a headache." She pouted, tears welling up in her eyes. Although the old Zhu, who had no experience in taking care of children, had long expected that such a trip would not be tolerated by an eight-year-old child, her physical strength could not resist such fatigue and what should he do about the train? He looked worriedly at Feifei's face again. Feifei's eyes were already closed, as if she wanted to sleep, but she was a little irritable and could not fall asleep for a while. "Feifei, do you feel better now?" "Want to drink water, Uncle Zhu, is there any water?" she asked anxiously, her two lips were very dry, and she kept licking them with her tongue. Zhu Zhaonian opened his eyes wide like a hungry wolf, and looked sharply at the crowd around him, while loudly asking everyone. "Which one of you will do a good deed? My child is sick! She is in urgent need of water, who is willing to share a cup, I will give you as much money as you want! Thank you! She is only eight years old...!" After shouting for a while, a middle-aged woman finally agreed, but she really didn't have any water - there was simply no one on the car who had a drop of water - she only took out half a strange, sour and astringent native pear from a handkerchief bag, and solemnly handed it to the people next to her, letting them pass it to the old Zhu; but when he saw the black and greasy pear flesh that had already been peeled, he was really scared in his heart and dared not feed it to Feifei. Later, he couldn't think of a better way, so he had to use his own teeth to gnaw off a layer of the outer flesh first, and then bite off small pieces to let Feifei chew; but the taste of this native pear was really too sour, Feifei only tasted three pieces, and then pushed it away with her hand, refusing to eat any more.

<h3>Old Canals, New Projects</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Xi'an, Second Day of the Month. Our Reporter, Zhang Xianzhou</p>
<p>The area along the Feng River in the southwestern suburbs of Xi'an was very prosperous in ancient times. People who have lived in Chang'an for a long time almost all know about the "Eight Rivers Encircling the City" and King Wen of the Zhou Dynasty's Lingtai (Spirit Terrace). It is said that during the Zhou and Qin dynasties, these rivers were used for canal transportation in the suburbs, and countless historical events must have unfolded along their banks. Later, those projects gradually faded away, and the old dream of the people became the sorrow of drought. The glorious achievements of our ancestors became mere beautiful memories. However, things have now changed, and new projects have been built on the old canals.</p>
<p>One of the Eight Benefits of Guanzhong</p>
<p>The Fenghui Canal starts from Qindu Town and flows northeast. After six years of construction, it cost a huge sum of 416,803,689.84 yuan, transforming 230,000 mu of farmland in the northwestern suburbs of the city into paddy fields. It has a stone-built flow dam, 133.27 meters long and 2.1 meters high, and two large and small sluice gates, totaling seven dou. Compared with canals like the Weihui Canal, this project may not seem grand, but it was started during the Anti-Japanese War. September of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) was a time of national hardship, economic distress, and tense confrontation between the enemy and us across the river. To undertake such a huge project under these circumstances is admirable and worthy of praise. At that time, prices were rising sharply, just like today. The funds for the Fenghui Canal were entirely loans from the Agricultural Bank, but the procedures were complicated, and the budget was often exceeded. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the loans were once suspended, but after repeated telegrams to the central government, it was finally completed. This allowed the residents of this ancient Qin and Han land to celebrate another harvest, and the water to be seen again at the edge of Taiyi Pool in Kunming. The Fenghui Canal was originally one of the "Eight Benefits of Guanzhong" planned by Mr. Li Yishe. It was originally expected to be completed in two years, but due to the Anti-Japanese War, it was delayed for nearly six years. The construction of the Fenghui Canal is similar to the suffering during the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, and its construction is one of the monuments to China's rebirth.</p>
<p>Waterwheels Will Become Obsolete</p>
<p>The reporter visited the Fenghui Canal's water release ceremony last month. After the ribbon-cutting, the sluice gates were raised, and the rapids rushed out from under the gates, splashing water. Military music slowly began to play, firecrackers exploded, the farmers smiled, and enthusiastic applause burst out. Countless paper flowers and handfuls of roses were thrown from the stage into the water, with red flowers and clear water, it was extremely beautiful. The "grand opera" that the villagers automatically hired also started. An old man told the reporter: "If this year's harvest is good, it will be even more lively, who knew that the crops would be damaged this year!" Then he told the reporter that the crops were bad and the "government loans" were too heavy, how could they live... and so on. They are waiting for relief. The reporter asked him about his views on the canal, he said: "I am from Daliu Village, west of the river, and cannot benefit from it. Today, this is just 'empty' excitement!" This year's rural famine is indeed worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Walking on the ancient trails, I had admired many waterwheels. A friend said: "These will all become obsolete in three or four years!" The people in the car silently agreed; the reporter silently imagined, what will prosperity be like here in three or four years.</p>

<h3>Reading Tan Yankai's Collected Poems</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zao</p>
<p>I love Mr. Tan Yankai's poems because they have a Tang-like style, which is completely different from the sharp, new, and rigid atmosphere of the Song poetry school.</p>
<p>He has a poem about a seesaw:</p>
<p>"Submitting to others is not meaningless, gaining clear springs fills the Hanyin;</p>
<p>The old gardener does not know the irrigation power, suspecting scheming when there is only the machine."</p>
<p>This indeed has a graceful demeanor. Irrigation power is the main body of all forces. Although the seesaw has "scheming machinery," it absolutely has no "scheming mind." The reason why today's national affairs cannot satisfy people is primarily due to the sabotage of people with scheming minds. The reason why the seesaw can "gain clear springs to fill Hanyin" is that although it has machinery, it has no scheming mind. Mr. Tan only pays attention to irrigation power, and when the water comes, the canal is naturally formed, which is natural and not harmful. I admire his gracefulness, but this cannot be understood by those old countrymen.</p>
<p>The sentence structure of this poem is also based on something. Ye Shaoyun's "Shilin Poetry Talk" says: "On the wall of the South Hall of the old Secretariat, there was a poem by Yan Yuanxian about a prostitute on a pole: 'Balancing on a hundred-foot pole with a graceful body, feet kicking and hanging, startling onlookers. Does the old man of Hanyin know? Embracing wheat with difficulty, but not poor'. At that time, it was inevitable that someone would say that Duke Wen of Lu was in the Secretariat, once meeting with Jinggong at the Secretariat, walking to the inscription and lingering for a long time, he could not have been unintentional. Jinggong wrote another poem after the poem one day: 'Ci can speak but does not know the truth, mistakenly promises his heart to the Hanyin man. It does not matter how much the seesaw bends and stretches, embracing a few areas of wheat, growing old in this body'."</p>
<p>These two poems and Tan Gong's poem use the same allusion, and the sentence structures are somewhat similar, but the themes and artistic conceptions are different. Yuanxian, Jinggong, and Tan Gong's identities are similar, but their atmospheres are different. I prefer Tan Gong's "Seesaw," and feel it "surpasses its predecessor."</p>
<p>Among the poems in the collection, the one most related to historical events is:</p>
<p>"A Farewell Gift to a Russian Returning Home</p>
<p>Farewells are always more numerous than meetings, a fleeting encounter in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Only the bright moon hanging overhead, sends you all the way to Moscow."</p>
<p>This refers to people like Borodin at that time. This heart is "as bright as the moon," and Tan Gong could not help but "worry comes from within."</p>
<p>Also, the poem "Pushing the Vanguard" says:</p>
<p>"Alas, what is the benefit of pushing forward, careful planning and defense, wisdom is already exhausted.</p>
<p>The ghost carriage truly rises and falls again, the dust of slander rises even more groundlessly.</p>
<p>The dark crow does not know who stops its flight, the trapped beast knows that fighting is difficult.</p>
<p>Do not say that floating clouds can temporarily obscure, who would lightly trifle with the bright moon."</p>
<p>This poem is even more obviously a sigh about the situation at that time. Anyone who understands the political situation at that time will not find it difficult to understand. I know that these poems will definitely be extremely valuable historical materials in the future.</p>
<p>After the success of the Northern Expedition, Tan Gong's works revealed a sense of joy, such as "Impromptu on the Dragon Boat Festival":</p>
<p>"Spending the Dragon Boat Festival beyond the Five Ridges, who would have expected to raise a glass to the river and sky:</p>
<p>Because of others' efforts, we have today, slowly in the middle</p>
<p>Feeling Zhou's journey.</p>
<p>One person serves many tasks, forgetting family meals, ten thousand bones succeed, mourning the country with wine:</p>
<p>It is good that the festival is not extravagant, few autumn events, good news is reported to Liaoyang."</p>
<p>If Tan Gong were still alive, seeing today's war in the Northeast, I wonder if he could still retain this joy?</p>
<p>Also, such as "New Year's Day of the Year of Ji Si":</p>
<p>"Old age sees the spring of peace again, the family and the country are harmonious again at this time:</p>
<p>The country has long known that we share happy years, there are no more unreturned people at the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>Enjoying the joy of grandchildren on the knees, abstaining from alcohol does not hurt the gradual entry into the level:</p>
<p>How many childhood pears and dates, it does not hurt to sit together and talk about the new year."</p>
<p>From this, we can see the joy of his family in his later years. But this refers to the younger generation, his wife died first. Every year on the third day of the third month and the fifteenth day of the seventh month, there must be works mourning her, the words are sincere and true, which ordinary poets cannot match. Record a few of them to see a glimpse.</p>
<p>"The moon is full and the autumn is clear as in past years, again seeing children worship before the wine;</p>
<p>Does your soul return to the underworld, the old mood turns more transparent.</p>
<p>I already sigh that the gaps of time mean few days, the wind and flowers are still as beautiful as in the past;</p>
<p>The wheel of ten thousand kalpas will eventually meet, why should a tiny dust cling to one day."</p>
<p>"The room is still as old as it was then, the past is gone and the person is gone, how sad;</p>
<p>Silently grieving for the passing years, diligently remembering the lingering shadows.</p>
<p>Bright lights and laughter, emotions like yesterday, cold rain and desolation, dreams do not come;</p>
<p>Now I am going to appeal to the Xiang River, knowing that my singing pillow is limited by the city."</p>
<p>"The moon on the high building is looking at each other, the old mood is sadly lonely:</p>
<p>Protracted illness does not avoid the nearness of the underworld, only in early autumn do I feel the coolness of ten thousand clothes.</p>
<p>I also know that the fasting and memorial services are just unnecessary, understanding that people and heaven share one light:</p>
<p>Delusional thoughts have been completely removed, why must this body determine existence or death."</p>
<p>This is not inferior to Yuan Wei's (Wei Zhi) most famous elegies, Yuan Wei has such vulgar words as "Today's salary exceeds one hundred thousand, I will use it to build a memorial for you," which is not as transcendent as "I also know that the fasting and memorial services are just unnecessary, understanding that people and heaven share one light." Tan Gong did not care much for his family after running around for the revolution. He lived alone after mourning his wife until his death, so he had the sentence "delusional thoughts removed," which is very different from those colleagues who took many concubines in their later years.</p>
<p>His poems are elegant and true, arising from the deepest emotions, truly as Mr. Ding Shuya said in recent times: "Because there is true emotion, I sigh with emotion, deleting flowery language, transforming into elegance," reading it can be seen that people are loyal to their spouse.</p>
<p>Gong is a true Confucian, taking "loving one's relatives and being benevolent to the people" as the supreme creed. Let us read his "Impromptu with Zhong":</p>
<p>"How many people's tears are about to overflow, passers-by still say welcome:</p>
<p>Heartbreaking to cover my ears on the road to Nan'an, fearing to hear the sound of firecrackers from poor burdens."</p>
<p>The feeling of "fearing the sound of firecrackers from the poor" is painful. It is a pity that the local officials who only knew how to flatter him could not understand.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, this article can only briefly quote his recent works, long poems, and ancient styles, and cannot comment on them one by one.</p>
<h3>Poetic Jottings</h3>
<p>— Kengqiang</p>
<p>Poetry is the alcohol lamp in the laboratory, and human life is the tablet placed in the test tube. Through the heat of poetry, human life can sublimate like an iodine tablet.</p>
<h3>Colloquial Sayings of the Time</h3>
<p>— Bai Yuan</p>
<p>During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, there was a strong trend of collecting colloquial proverbs into couplets. Zhou Zongtai's "More Outrageous Than This" volume three, has "Collection of Proverbs" one hundred and eighty-four couplets, Zhang Nanzhuang's "What a Story," and the wandering Taoist's "Common Sayings" two books, also collected many. The one that was compiled into a special book was Wang Youguang's (Guanguo) "Wu Xia Proverb Couplets" four volumes (Jiaqing Gengchen printed edition), recording one hundred and forty-nine couplets. Even in the collections of scholars' literary works, there are such proverb couplets, such as Zhang Wenhu's "Miscellaneous Writings from the Shuyi Studio" (collected in "Complete Works from the Shuyi Studio")'s "Collection of Proverb Couplets," which is one example.</p>
<p>There was also the practice of collecting colloquial proverbs into poems, which was an extension and expansion of collecting couplets, such as "More Outrageous Than This" volume three "Colloquial Proverbs," collecting twenty-two poems. The preface to the first one says:</p>
<p>"Colloquialisms are everywhere, but they are especially prevalent in our Wu region. Painting is always boring, and I occasionally play with children, collecting ancient ballads and colloquial proverbs, linking them together to form poems. Although the writing is not elegant or docile, knowledgeable people laugh; however, what the old people say, there is quite some meaning in it, worth pondering. Therefore, I record and preserve them, to provide material for poetry society talks and laughs, regardless of skill or clumsiness. The so-called 'quite some meaning, worth pondering,' is also just a formality; it is actually just one end of a word game. What is noteworthy is not its literary value, but its documentary value, which is enough to explain the ebb and flow of this trend. Of the twenty-two poems, only a few are worth seeing, such as the one about illness:</p>
<p>'One knows one's own illness, heart disease should be treated with heart medicine. Let go when you can let go, losing a bargain is a bargain'."</p>
<p>And the poem about money says:</p>
<p>"East hand receives, west hand goes, easy to part, difficult to meet; a penny can kill a hero, how many bystanders watch with cold eyes."</p>
<p>These two collect colloquial proverbs quite naturally, with a lot of humor. Collecting colloquial sayings is a major feature of Paiban literature.</p>
<p>The trend of collecting colloquial proverbs into poems was still very strong during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods, and there were even special books compiled, such as Shao Yichen's "Collection of Hangzhou Proverb Poems." The poems consist of one hundred and thirty-seven songs, published in the Guangxu period, printed on white cotton paper, and the book quality is quite exquisite. At the end of the book is Shao Xi'en's inscription:</p>
<p>"This is a playful work by my late uncle, Wei Xi Gong. The Duke ascended to the virtuous books at a young age, from the Wei Province to the Eight Direct Secretariats. His talent was quick and agile, and his answers flowed like a stream. Whenever he discussed current affairs, he spoke frankly and never flattered, so the capital praised him highly. Later, because he asked to return home, he closed his door and chanted, only reading ancient texts to amuse himself every day. In his spare time, he compiled one hundred and thirty-seven five-character Hangzhou proverb poems, and the clan parties competed to copy them, and even women and children enjoyed reciting them. The ingenious thoughts are intricately combined, and the starting and ending points often contain profound truths and famous sayings, not just for the sake of matching pairs. During the Xinyou Rebellion of the Yue bandits, the Duke died in his hometown; his works were voluminous, but they were all lost in the fire. ... In the autumn of Yi Hai, En was sent to the capital and found this book at a fellow villager's house. He reviewed it repeatedly, and felt that the Duke's jokes and humor were as rich as yesterday. He quickly borrowed it and copied it by hand, keeping it as a family treasure. ... It should be entrusted to the hand of the people, to provide for the enjoyment of like-minded people. ..."</p>
<p>According to Shao Yichen's word is Wei Xi, Renhe native, Jinshi in the special examination in the twenty-first year of Daoguang, an official in the Zhongshu Sheren, and later an official in the Criminal Department Yuanwailang; later, he worked on the He River project, was impeached, returned to Hangzhou, and died in the Xianfeng eleventh year. His works include: "Shangshu Dayi," lost; "Yili Tonglun" and "Chenxing Lu," with transmitted editions. Pan Zuyin and others also compiled his poems into "Manuscripts of Mr. Huixi" (totaling fifty-six poems), included in the "Pangxi Pian Series."</p>
<p>Shao's poems, numbering over one hundred, were six times more than those of Zhou Zongtai. However, the lack of titles for each poem and the use of obscure proverbs without annotations are its shortcomings. Those that are commendable include:</p>
<p>"Rain falls, heaven keeps guests, time and again ghosts play with people. Knocking on the door breaks the night, setting fire to oneself. The tiger swallows the butterfly, the lazy man serves the people. Three liters, three he, fate, clap hands, no awning."</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>"Poor man suffers for a long time, the teacher is busy looking for a job. Marry a wife, first look at the mother-in-law, whoever has milk is the mother. Gambling eats up the examination, hemp whiskers are black, fat, and long. Hitting the head doesn't respond to the brain, auntie calls a hundred flowers fragrant."</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>"What is asked is not what is answered, can be met but not sought. Not yet returned to three feet of earth, climb another floor. Few desires, many sons, white hair before old age. Adults are not at ease, being a ghost is also romantic."</p>
<p>Looking at them alone, they are indeed neatly matched, but linking them into poems gives a "vague feeling," perhaps the work of a scholar is always separated by a layer from that of a commoner?</p>
<p>In addition, there is also "Wu Proverb Poetry Manuscript," one type. The author, Wang Zhang, Zi Qiao, Suzhou native, uncle of musician Wang Jilie. According to Wang Jilie's postscript, he tried the provincial examination seven times unsuccessfully, probably also a wandering person. The recorded verses include more than two hundred and twenty five-character poems, and several dozen seven-character poems with titles. A volume of lead-printed edition. The first Luoting Zhu Junyu's preface and Wang Zhang's self-preface are both titled Xinyou, which is the tenth year of the Republic of China. It seems that it was made after the entry into the Republic of China, so it is not taken. The purpose of involving this book is to point out: this trend has not died out to this day. Shao Yichen, Hangzhou native Zhou, Zongtai, and Wang Zhang, Suzhou natives, is this perhaps a characteristic of Suzhou and Hangzhou literature?</p>
<p>Collecting proverbs focuses on faithful recording, being able to preserve its original appearance; but in this academic matter, the predecessors lacked an objective attitude. Using them for couplets, after the compiler's cutting and trimming, to the point of combining proverb couplets into poems, it is already a decline. However, it is commendable that the predecessors could pay attention to common affairs and common things.</p>
