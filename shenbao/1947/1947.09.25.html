<h3>自務外匯入口貨物　處理辦法原則確定　待政院臨時會通過施行</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京廿四日電〕自備外匯入口貨物處理辦法，前經政務會議詳予討論後，廿四日政院復召集有關機關舉行特種審査小組會討論，當經確定數項原則，交廿七日臨時政務會議討論，通過後即付實施，茲誌此原則要點如次：　自政府公布國人在國外存款自動申報辦法後，自備外匯即必須向國行自動申報，辦理轉賬手續，經此手續後，通過國行之准許，即可購買入口物資，其未向國行申報之自備外匯，一律不准使用，如此，政府即可控制全部外匯。　關係滬海關凍結之自備外滙入口貨物，原則上予以解凍，惟列在禁止入口之奢侈品如汽車，口紅等，一律不准入口，其他特准入口之物資，視其情節之輕重，課以重稅後，再准其入口。今日之會，係由財長俞鴻鈞主持，　對滬海關凍結之自備外匯入口貨物之總値提出報吿，謂僅四千美元，外傳一億美元說不確，且其中百分之七十以上均係未列名機器。新聞紙。肥料。藥品及　片等工業原料，其課稅標準，財部已擬定為百分之五十至百分之百。按今日會中所研討者，係因根據管理進出口貿易辦法第九條之規定「進口商未經領得　入許可證以前，不得向國外洽辦訂購貨品手續」，而進口商自備外匯逕在國外訂貨進口者，究應如何處理，乃作如上之決定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據靑年黨人士表示：「開放地方政權之商談，迄在南京進行，靑年黨對於廳長，專員，縣長，中學校長等職位，曾有要求提出，但外傳要求某有主席之說，恐非確訊。至於要求之名額與範圍，過去曾有「三：一：一」之協議。此原則應不僅適川於中央，亦當適用於地方。惟開放地方政權與提出大選候選人名單，為兩件事，故要求不遂而拒提名單之說，實不足信。」</p>

<h3>美記者旅行山東　揭破中國共產黨之謎</h3>
<p>美國斯克里浦霍華德系報紙記者牛頓（W．sH．Newton）於九月九日自山東　縣發出通訊，描寫共匪區域最近情况之一斑。茲譯錄其原文如下：</p>
<p>「訪問受戰禍損害中國許多爭奪的城市及戰區，與士兵百姓們談談，使我們可以揭破幾種關於中國共產黨以及關於中國國民政府之謎了。</p>
<p>「第一種謎：以為共產黨大概頗受中國普通百姓，窮苦農夫與村民所愛戴。但事實上則是：就山東有境而論，共產黨不單為富者所非常懼怕，同時亦為窮人所非常懼怕。</p>
<p>「舉例言之，過去六個月內被共產黨所佔據的益都（Yitu），在被佔期內所有的商業都停止了，所有的店舖都關門了，敎會學校與醫院都被封閉，大批的百姓逃亡他鄉。這種情形，在臨　（Linchu）以及其他的許多村莊都是如此！</p>
<p>「第二種謎！以為共產黨軍隊是「人民的軍隊」，意思說這是管通的農夫對國民政府的反抗。我曾與許多在臨　一役中被國民黨所俘獲的共產黨俘　談話，幾乎沒有一個人懂得「共產主義」的意義，他們大多數都是受强迫加入，強迫作戰。其中少數本來是國民黨的士兵在以前戰事中被俘，而被强迫來與政府作戰的。</p>
<p>「第三種謎：以為共產黨在他們所控制的區域內允許任何限度的宗敎自由。這祗有在那少數有外國傳敎士的城巿裏才有這種例外，因為他們可能把情形報吿出去的。但即使在道種例子之下，宗敎禮　亦受阻礙，中國牧師則被迫害侮辱。</p>
<p>「中國長老會與浸禮會的牧師，常被指控是「美國的間諜」而驅逐出境。天主敎徒，一般說來，尤受迫害。</p>
<p>舉例說，在（Chinchik）地方，共產黨衝到天主敎堂裏，把一切有價値的東西都拿走了，給那德國神父約値美金五分的賠償損害。在（Changchia）地方，中國長老會的牧師被迫逃亡，他們的家庭被從容摧毀。</p>
<p>共產黨的政治指導員在（Changtuan）地方搜集長老會牧師所分發的聖經，把它們焚燬。在（Shawo）地方的共產黨企圖强迫長老會牧師命令敎堂中敎士出席共產黨的集會；他拒絕了。濰縣一區內共有五十所長老會敎堂，祗有四所——那是在國民黨區域內——還可以自由做禮拜。</p>

<p>「第四種謎：以為那大有招徠意味的士地改革計劃已贏得了農民對共產黨的傾向。有幾次共產黨沒收地主的士地分配給農民，那是事實，但接着來的，共產黨就把實稅加在他們頭上，徵用所有的收成來飼養共產黨的軍隊，並且壓迫那些接受土地的農夫加入軍隊。</p>

<p>「國民黨軍隊在過境時亦向農村微稅，確是事實。這似乎是戰爭雙方的殘忍的必需。不過在山東省內，至少，當共產黨奪得一城時，百姓都逃亡了，而常國民黨收復時，則百姓又同來了。</p>

<h3>厭戰·逃亡·悲觀·鬆懈　陳毅匪部之悲慘命運　在「政委」報吿中暴露無遺</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕共匪陳毅部第三縱隊「政委」汪大年，向陳所作「軍中一般思想狀况」及對作戰態度等之報吿，全文二千餘字，被我第五飾於　城附近鹵獲，該報吿充分表現對陳毅之不滿及士氣消沉悲觀之現象，逃兵記載亦甚多，此實一匪軍　好之「宣傳品」也。茲略誌如後：　日常生活以行軍時間為多，而到處遇水，故人皆爛足，且缺糧，常以生　　子充飢。　逃亡士兵為多，第十縱隊自魯中至　魯豫後，統計即有二千人，故現在己經縮編。　思想狀况，三縱驗自濟寗戰鬥失敗後，因有五個連全軍覆沒，七個連全部傷亡了，所以作戰後，具體反映的有四種情緖：（甲）埋怨：上下左右普遍埋怨陳軍長，怨其主觀主義，團級幹部認為本係一極好之殲滅戰，但上級未掌握好，同時怨彈藥不足，指揮不良；怨政工人員吹牛皮因動員時係說只要包圍，不一定打到城裏，說是七十二師殘部最多兩個團，只有三門砲，一門還是放不響的。（乙）悲觀：大部份士兵不吃飯，到處找老鄉，看見家裏人傷亡了就號淘痛哭，或終日死睡，有的哭着說：「只賸我一個了！」有些老戰士就大吃大喝，對反攻不信我們能騰利，他們說消滅了廿六師，又來了二十六師，他們說消減了七十二師又來了七十二師，某某永遠也打不了，所以他們都大批逃亡，八師二十二團一夜走了三十個，個別特務份子就乘機活動了，提着機槍逃跑。（丙）鬆懈；幹部對逃亡違法等問題均置之不理，一個排長說，當個排長帶三二個兵，行軍時一小節，眞不起勁；廿七團有一政治敎官楊洪輝，大哭大時，不問工作。（丁）等待整師。以上四種情緒很普遍，一般思想都很混亂，尤其是表現於有傾情緒，有人說「打不死跑死，跑不死餓死」，卅四團四通有十三個俘虜，有組織的帶了五枝槍逃跑，其中二人是黨員。有人說：「反攻反攻丟了山東」！三縱隊因後面被人窮追，自稱「逃亡縱隊」；第卅二團紀律更壞，打駡地方幹部，亂要糧草，民伕强買東西，强拉牲口，分別强姦等等。據賴少其說，紀律太壞，政治工作沒辦法，宣傳工作做完了，現在只有用　頭來維持。又有人說，陳軍長千算萬算，就是糧食沒算，沒鞋子走路。最後提出兩點要求：　明確戰略方針，　補充休整。末署名「職　大年，九月十三日」。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>論大學敎育十年計劃</h3>
<p>— 胡先骕</p>
<p>北京大學校長胡適日前發表其向當局所建議之十年敎育計劃，頗引起各方之注意。國府委員鄒魯關心中山大學，故曾致胡氏一封公開信，詢問其所云之中大係中央大學抑中山大學。南開大學敎務長陳序經，對於胡氐主張完全取消留學外國，表示異議。其他敎育界人士著論討論此問題者，亦大有人在。可見此問題為國內各界所重視；故筆者亦欲發表個人之意見以與國人商榷之。</p>
<p>胡氏主張在兩個五年內政府特別培植北大，淸華，浙大，武大，中大五個國立大學，其意未嘗不是。此五校固然可稱為國內第一流大學，但若謂僅有此五校値得政府特別培植，則此語尙有商作之餘地。如交通大學數十年來為國內最有名之工科大學，圖書機械設備均甚充裕，其在學術之地位不在北大等五校之下；交大豈不値得政府特別培植乎？中山大學過去在國立各大學中規模最大，圖書議器最為充足，其農學院醫學院均頗有名，而陳煥　敎授所主持之農林植物硏究所久已蜚聲國際，為硏究中國　物分類學一最有名機關，其標本圖書之多，僅次於靜生生物調査所，胡氏所稱之五大學皆非其匹也。惜自一般而言，紀律稍嫌鬆懈，學術空氣不甚濃厚，而在此次抗戰中，圖書　本損失殆盡。然此乃紀念孫中山先生大學，規模既大，過去亦有光榮之歷史，政府尤宜積極加以整頓，特別培植，使成為南中國之第一流學府者也。竊謂除此七個大學政府宣特別培植外，同時尙須加意培植若干大學，如師大，東北，復且，曁南，同濟，四川，中正，南開，廈門，湖南等十校，取過去有長久歷史，或有素負盛名之學院。在第一個十年計劃內政府或無力對此十校特別培植，但亦必須充實其師資與圖書設備，使達到歐美一般大學水準。至於台灣大學，本有充實之圖書設備，但須充實其師資，使能保存其在日人管理時代之水準即足矣。此外，其他大學，則只有在第二個十年計劃中始能顧及。然中國潛力極大，苟政治上軌道，工業化在進展中，則國力增長至速，或者不待十年，不但政府可以改進共他大學，尙可增設甚多之新大學。蘇聯建國於今不過二十年，其國內已有大學七百八十餘個，硏究所千餘個，我國豈與之相去永久如是之遠？果爾，將何以建國？更何論於所謂之迎頭趕上乎？</p>
<p>復次，談十年大學敎育計劃，切勿漢視研究機關。胡氏謂大學喝稀飯，研究機關寗不喝稀飯？中央研究院為國內最高之硏究機關，其經費已不裕。北平研究院之經費窘迫，尤匪夷所思。其他公私立研究機關，亦莫不在窘鄉。大學經費本自龐大，在最近將來，必不能設立大規模之研究所，必也儘可能擴充現有之公私硏究機關而使之與大學密切聯繫，使之在其專門研究範圍之內，指導大學硏究院之學生，則大學可得最佳之高級導師，且可利用研究所之圖畫設備標本，而不必自行置備，在硏究所方面亦可使研究與敎育不脫節，而能為國家培植本機關所擅長硏究之科學之人才，而免去才難之歎，則雙方交受其益矣。此層過去未會做到，今則中央硏究院各所方有與中央大學合作之議，此後政府亟宜鼓勵此種兩利之合作也。</p>
<p>至於目前之留學政策，殊未盡善。大批公費私費學生，在國內準備既未充分，甚几外國語之準備均不定，僅圖往國外鍍金，不惜耗費大量外匯，殊屬不智。然絕對禁止留學，使學生不能獲得國內大學所不能領導之硏究之機會，以完成其個人求學之目的，與適應國家之需要，亦非長策。竊以為不妨對於留學加以更嚴格之限制。公私留學生名額减去目前所有者三分之二，規定惟大學敎授講師助敎或硏究所人員方能出國研究；再規定使各第一流大學及各公私硏究機關儘速充實硏究設備，招收較多之硏究生，學成後即使之應國家博士考試，必須得有博士學位之後，始可派往外國著名大學留學一二年，則所造就者確為第一流學者，而不致虛糜公私財富矣。</p>
<p>大學敎育在抗戰時期頗失常軌。今抗戰結東已及二年而尙未加以整頓，殊屬非是。今憲法規定以國家總預算百分之十五為敎育科學文化經費，自三十七年度起即須實行。一方面增加大量經費，一方面减少留學經費三分之二，則儘可以充實各大學與各研究機關，使之可以積極改進，則大學興公私各研究機關皆可不喝粥而完成其任務，中國學術自能獨立矣。</p>
<h3>台公佈兩辦法制止擾亂金融　赴粵閩旅客限携法幣五十萬</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿四日電〕台省府對面臨之金融問題，特公佈兩項辦法，此係魏道明赴京前決定者。聞另有辦法一種，尙須商請財部之同意後，始可發表。公佈之兩項辦法，一為自財部規定對自內地携帶法幣前往閩粵口岸每人不得超過五十萬，否則沒收後，一般商人多由上海携帶法幣來台，再套取圖利，以致最近台省方面竟發生法幣黑市兌換賣買，擾亂金融，台省當局決定嚴厲制止，在台省各口開始檢査前往閩粵旅客所携法幣之數額，倘超過五十萬元者，超過數沒收。另一辦法則為禁止凡經營銀錢業之公私商號，再行經營存放款及匯兌等業務，尤其對於經營法幣與台幣之匯兌，及兌換業務之公私商號，決予嚴禁。</p>

<p>（本報訊）紐約廿四日廣播：成功湖訊，託管委員會今日上午十一時開會，由紐西蘭代表貝倫特生任主席，白俄羅斯代表希米哥夫被選為副主席，海地代表杜辛維爾被選為發言人。經濟委員會由桑泰克魯士任主席，荷蘭代表柏蒂恩被選為副主席，捷克代表亨克被選為發言人。</p>
<p>（中央社弗營辛草地廿三日電）聯合國大會，今日通渦指導委會所提出之議程後，現已完成其組織階段之工作。自明日起，大會將遷往成功湖，開始實際工作，而將以議程上之六十一項議題，分交六委會及兩特設委會作實際討論。今日會議經整日之愼密討論後，決議通過臨時議程上之各項議題。所通過之各項議題中，除希臘及對義和約問題外　　均未經任何爭辯，即獲順利通過。此外，大會以廿九票對十一票通過設立專門處理巴勒斯坦間題之特委會案，　權者六票。大會在表決議程問題前，會先後聆聽聯合國秘書長賴依演說（見昨電），賴氏之特別呼　猶在耳際，而蘇代表維辛新基與美代表奧斯汀，即為大會議程中列入希臘朝解及對義和約聞題之是否合法一點，又展開舌戰。維氏認為解決朝鮮獨立問題，乃有關各大國之責任，而非聯合國所應討論者。維氏將朝鮮問題之陷入僵局，歸咎於美國時，美代表奧斯汀亦不甘示弱，立即起立答　。我國代表蔣廷敝，在支持美方意見時，重申我國對朝鮮獨立之立塲（此項立塲曾由我代表顧維竣在大會中表明）。表決對羲和約問題是否應列入大會討論之議程時，我國放棄投票，投票反對之國家中，有阿比西尼亞及蘇聯集團諸國。美國在對上述問題作含有實騐性之初步表決中，雖然獲得勝利，惟月下尙不能決定是否即為美國在此次對蘇外交戰中，已獲眞正勝利，蓋截至目前為止，聯合國大會之討論，尙僅及程序問題也。</p>
<h3>杜魯門召集閣議　關於糧食情形聲明今日可發表　克萊頓等奉召回國報告</h3>
<p>（本報訊）舊金山廿四日廣播：杜魯門總統今日召集特別內閣曾議，討論官方所謂「一般之糧食情形」。衆料內閣曾議將討論西歐請求援助問題，及其對美國內物價之可能影響。據白宮新聞秘書稱：杜魯門總統之聲明，今晚不發表，可能在明日發表，蓋總統已定明日召開新聞會議也。</p>
<p>（路透社華盛頓廿三日電）杜魯門總統今日再度接見農長安特遜，準備渠所將發表關於美國對於世界糧食問題應盡責任之聲明。權威方面謂總統此一聲明內容，將包括下列數點：　指出本年世界穀物供應不足之額將達四至五百萬噸，世界人民已遭飢饉威脅。　要求制止芝加哥殼物市塲之投機風浪，以防刺激糧價，免使缺乏美元之歐洲國家再受打擊。　呼籲農民停止以穀飼畜，並囑人民自動减少肉類消費。　宣佈暫定减少出口一億蒲式耳，以减少對芝加哥市場之刺激。同時聲明一俟市塲趨於穩定，當再提高出口數量。　建議於國會核准撥款後，以營十　價値較高而價格亦較高之過剩糧食，如乾菓，食糖等輸出，以補减少輸出之　物。關係方面預料總統不致要求使政府得有强迫征購糧食之權，惟外國官員多認此一辦法為應付世界糧荒之唯一解決辦法。」</p>
<p>（聯合社華盛頓廿四日電）國務卿馬歇爾為加緊應付歐洲危機起見，今日電召副國務卿克萊頓及駐英大使陶格拉斯蹄國，報吿巴黎經濟會議經過詳情。二人可望於下星期內到京。西歐十六國所擬美國援助方案已於昨夜由「英王信差」送至此　，今晨提交國務院，國務院　　　局審査工作至少須一星期，始能決定美國對其結論是否同意。</p>
<h3>英國令禁　反猶運動　瓊斯抵達紐約</h3>
<p>（本報訊）倫敦廿四日廣播：英政府深恐目前之反猶遝動，將造成「極惡劣之局勢」，故已下令營察禁止人民在公共塲所發表演說，攻擊猶人。至於不攻擊猶人而僅支持法西斯觀念之演述者，英政府則不加干涉。凡致詞斥駡猶人者，將由密警加以注意，再由國家提起公訴。彼等之罪各為「煽動暴行」。</p>
<p>（路透社紐約廿三日電）英殖民大臣　斯，今夜自倫敎抵此，將向聯大發表英國之巴勒斯坦政策。</p>
<h3>聯大韓觀察員　抨擊維辛斯基</h3>
<p>要求蘇聯撤退北韓駐軍</p>
<p>（聯合社紐約廿三日電）聯大朝鮮觀察員殷露易今日就蘇聯代表維辛斯基之演說發表聲明稱，「在國際史上，重要之外長演說有如此矛盾者，自希特勒以來，莫此為甚。維辛斯基君强力主張外國軍隊應一律退出非敵性國領土，然則蘇聯何不為天下倡，撤退其駐北鮮之軍隊乎？馬歇爾君以朝鮮問題列人大會議程，自屬有理。唯有世界輿論之力及各國代表理智的決議，能使朝鮮成爲自由民主之國，以供獻於亞洲之和平。」</p>
<h3>蘇聯在庫頁島　拘留韓人四萬</h3>
<p>（聯合社漢城廿四日電）朝鮮靑年一名化名退出庫頁島，今日到此。據稱，該島現仍拘有朝鮮人四萬名，蘇聯當局以「朝鮮尙未有政府」為藉口，不應予以遺送回國。其中百分之六十係量朝鮮南部人。</p>
<h3>美國資源豐富　足供歐洲需要　調查委員會完成報告書</h3>
<p>（合衆社華盛頓廿四日電）此間廿四日獲悉：杜魯門總統於六月間設置之特別委員會　將於木週末向總統提供調査報吿，該報吿顯示美國如能作「若干調整」，實具有足供歐洲依馬歇爾計劃所需要之大部份資源。此委員會由內長克魯格主持，報吿內容着重美國經濟之伸縮性，能適應如第二次世界大戰之嚴重要求。</p>
<p>一般觀察：馬歇爾計劃乃一運串試騐之又一次，此類試驗在過去並不成功。總統設立該委員會，專供調査美國資源及其與歐洲建設需要間之關係，並準備一平衡表。委員曾經三月之　張工作，報吿業己完成。就美國之資源而言，馬歇爾計劃所需求之責任，可以順利完成。惟報告中警告，如欲應付歐洲之估計，則若干稀有物資之代替及分配方面之調整刻不容緩。權威人士稱：此報告指出小麥，　類，煤斤，鋼鐵，氮氣，肥料及若干種工業設備，在今後數年間將吿稀少。熟悉報吿之官員稱：報吿書出謂設無自動或政府强制之分派，恐無法達到某數種出口水準。但稱：「如有必要之調整，報告無令人沮喪之處。」克魯格報吿將應付歐洲需求品之最後決定權及建議權，交付由商業部長哈里曼主持之另一總統委員會。</p>
<h3>貝特柯夫處死事　英美譴責保政府</h3>
<p>（路透社華盛頓廿三日電）美政府今日宣稱：世界與論，認保政府之處決貝特柯夫，顯示其不願尊重公理之最低原則，及人類之基本機利。國務院於此發表之聲明，指出貝特柯夫案審判之時問及方式，以其保政府之其他壓制措施，顯示共黨操縱之祖國陣綫黨政府，意圖消滅一切反對勢力，而鞏國其極權政府。</p>
<p>（合衆社倫敦廿三日電）此間外交界方面稱，英國認為貝特柯夫之被處死刑，乃「遠反歐洲之文明」。英外相貝文曾與其顧問　商，是否向保政府提出正式抗議。傳貝文對此事極為重視。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾計劃實現有待　英準備自力更生　擬就應付危機最後計劃</h3>
<p>（路透社倫敎廿四日電）權威方而　　：英國克服經濟危機之前後計劃，需要在今後十五個月內，生產價値十七億鎊之出口物品，並決定在不達目的前，決不減　緊縮政策。英政府預定於一九四八年年底，得以補足入超六億鎊。</p>
<p>其計劃具有五大要點，即：　减少輸入，　减少國外支出，　增加出口，　築中資源於主要工業，　增加英國及殖民地農產。英國入超總額雖為六億鎊，然對美元區之入超則為八億鎊，此蓋英國對非美元區之國，前此曾有出超之故。入超之　補方法有二：　减少輸入約二億鎊，　至明年仲夏增加輸出三億七千萬鎊，至明年年底增加輸出五億七千萬鎊，較一九三八年之水準各增加百分之四十及六十，此僅克服當前經濟危機之目標，欲使恢復繁榮水準，當需增加出口至戰前之百分之一百七十五，此則須至一九四九年始克完成。英國之一切計劃，係以不獲馬歇爾計劃下之援助為估計標準。為維持過渡期間之需要起見，英國當不得不動用其黃金準備金，或請國際貨幣基金會撥款墊付。</p>
<h3>緬血案開審</h3>
<p>（路透社仰光廿四日電）緬內閣血案十大嫌疑兇犯，包括前總理鄔沙，今日開始在仰光受審</p>
<h3>美元恐慌日趨嚴重　法向美呼籲援助　傅將被迫停購美國物資</h3>
<p>（合衆社華盛頓廿三日電）據外交界可靠方面稱：法國業己向美國提出一連串要求，如遭拒絕，則將使馬歇爾計劃倒退六個月。傳法駐美大使龐萊曾以下列二事通知美風：　法國將於十月下旬起停止在美購買物資，此乃美元缺乏之必然後果；按法國現僅向美國購買汕脂，麵粉，煤。　除非覓得一辦法能將上項物品繼續　往法國，否則法國煤斤　　將减少百分之三十以上，蓋工人無足够之糧食飽腹也。</p>
<h3>法國關切　德境情形</h3>
<p>（合衆社巴黎廿三日電）法外交部方面稱：十六國對馬歇爾計劃所提報吿能否成功，繫於西德是否包括於歐洲經濟之內，及美國之關稅政策如何而定。「除非美國門戶須對歐洲貨物開放，否則歐洲經濟復興即將無望」。法外部發言人又稱：在本年年底以前，對西德全部之經濟組織，列強顯然必須獲取協議，否則馬歇爾計劃將遭嚴重打擊。</p>
<h3>國際銀行　無款援歐</h3>
<p>擬再向美國推銷債券</p>
<p>（聯合　華盛頓廿三日電）國際復興銀行副總裁賈納今日宣稱，西歐十六國經濟復興四年計劃，共需英金二百廿四憶美元，雖規定其中馬歇爾計劃項下，由美政府資助一百九十三億美元，另由世界銀行借貸卅一億美元，惟該行目下僅有五億美元左右，可供借貸之用。為補救計，唯有再向美國投資人推銷債券。故在事實上，歐洲復興所需之費須全部出於美國投資人。惟該行發行債券不欲專為歐洲。</p>
<h3>義紡織工人　實行總罷工</h3>
<p>政府在議會中受挫</p>
<p>（本報訊）倫敦廿四日廣播：義大利紡織工業之全都技術人員，實标總罷工，紡織工人如無技術人員之指導，勢將被迫停止工作，故在數日之內可能釀成重大危機，而使五十五萬人無工可做。該項罷工係獲共黨控制之義大利勞工聯合會之支持者。</p>

<h3>片山內閣沐猴而冠　吉田茂之調侃</h3>
<p>（新亞社東京廿四日電）國會開會在即，片山內閣由於與黨及反對黨對經濟力築中排除法案及石炭國管法案之猛烈攻擊，勢將遭遇空前之困難，尤以自由黨總裁前目相吉田，抨擊政府，不譴餘力。吉田在北海道之某次演說中，曾公然稱片山內閣為「犬猴雜處之家庭」。吉田認為目前　有組織一黨而單純之內閣，始能應付和會，渡過歷史上最艱苦之旅程，但社會黨決不能担負此使命云。</p>
<h3>平沼騏一郞受審</h3>
<p>（中央社東京二十四日電）軍事法庭今日為前日首相平沼騏一郞案進行辯護。被吿方面提出美前駐日大使格魯之證管，然為審判長魏勃拒絕。魏氏稱：格魯大使之聲明，純屬個人意見，而法庭所獲之事實，較格魯在當時所知者為多。魏氏峻然曰：「法庭不擬再廳閣下之意見。」至此辯論始畢，而格魯聲明終遭拒絕。</p>

<h3>參議員質詢五局敎育成衆矢之的　今日四次會議討論提案</h3>
<p>（本報訊）昨日上午市參議會社會，工務，敎育，財政，警政各委員會曾在該會分別舉行小組會議　　　查提案。下午參議會四次大會舉行第三次會議，各參議員對公用，敎育，衛生，工務，地地政之施政有熱烈質詢，歷時二小時半。尙有不及口頭提出者，則改書面詢問，然後由地政局祝平局長，工務局趙祖康局長，公用局趙曾　局長先後答覆。至衛生及敎育兩局長之答復，因開會時間已過，延至今日下午舉行。</p>
<p>參議員昨對敎育局之質詢特多，龐京周報吿一事實，謂私校收費仍有超過標準者。敎局命各校作預算表給敎局審査，以示經濟公開，而學校當局竟將　設名目之表格分發各家長，徵求同意後蓋章寄回。有家長表示不滿擬作批評者，則子弟每苦苦哀求家長稱：「若不蓋章同意，學校裏要扣我分數」，於是家長亦即含糊蓋章云云。此種情形不但有害家長，且影響子弟敎育至鉅，使彼等自幼即學成欺騙違法行為，實堪痛心。未知敎育當局有否注意？</p>
<p>周濂澤稱，老靶子路一市立師範專校虛報學生名額，有詐欺貪汚罪嫌，敎局何不飭査？張志韓，謝大荒，謂市立師範專校附中將務本女中房屋破壞，損失達一億元以上，堂堂敎育機關有此野　行動，應請嚴辦。路式導稱：楊樹浦為獻校祝壽捐款六七億，現成立四學校，均在里弄內，其中兩房子乃由私立改組，此種情形實違反祝壽原旨。鍾玉良謂國民小學為何不能開除惡劣學生？對不良敎員又何以不能調動？趙仰雄大聲疾呼請掃除文盲，以减少社曾種種不良情形。</p>
<p>蔣紀周說：國民小學有許多設在里弄內，且上課時間在淸早或晚上，既礙學生健康，且白天　仕家中或在馬路上遊蕩，如此敎育，豈可樂觀？又校長人選是否公平合理？</p>
<p>尊師獻金作何用途</p>
<p>陳　問：去年上半年市校尊師金一億元作何用途？又看發還進修金，中學僅得半數，小學尙未還，是否擬繼續發還？姜豪請在老閘區設市立學校。候　任請在新　設學校。　德超謂　前市校學費因名目紫多，較私校更多，有浦東市校學生因無法繳費，被　棄校外，當局應予設法。</p>
<p>關於衛生局者，候　人謂同仁輔元堂屍體放在路旁，影響衛生，請即飭查取締。張中原希望市立醫院先收病人再索費用。范守淵請制止外界利用醫生名義，亂做廣吿，騙取金錢。又對馬路上垃圾糞便汚水，請衛生局設法淸除。</p>
<h3>緊張的一幕　汽車加油不均力爭限額配售</h3>
<p>公用方面質詢：參議員對於汽車加油之管理不良，紛紛表示不不滿。費樹聲尤力主限額配售，引起一緊張塲面。費構，汽車加油常遇加不到之苦，油站送油又不準時，於是黃牛黨乘機囤積。有次親眼看見一卡車購油時，蹬上記着每日加四千或五十加侖，而運照規定憑證去加敎加侖者亦不易得到，試問既有卡證，因何</p>
<p>趙局長解釋謂：困難問題甚多，現公用局共發證約一萬六千張，加油站祗四十九處，運油車亦少，大家都去加，即造成不及應付現象。其實油量不缺，謂參議會勸導市民毋庸驚慌。但加油站舞弊情形確有，經調査後已有油站被封閉。又會請油公司撤換油站主皆人。局方現正儘量設法改善辦法，昨已通知油公司以後規定大卡車每日最多祗可加十五加侖，汽車每日五加侖。費氏對局長答復認為不滿，堅請按其需要分別規定卡車及汽車每月用量，不得多加，以防囤積。趙局長即表示加汕問題複雜，願與費參議員詳細商討將意見提經濟檢査會報。費氐堅持其主張要請局長接受，後由徐副議長發表意見，請局長將費參議員建議提經濟檢査曾報向討，此案始　。</p>
<h3>公用事業漲價　押爲何亦漲</h3>
<p>費　　又問：公用事業漲價，押　為何亦漲價？趙局長答：押櫃現均名保證金，其加價乃由中央規定，但市府為减輕市民負担，前特邀集各公司當局舉行會議定一變通辦法，規定一年內至多祗可調整二次，如有超過，本局可予處理。費氏請局長代上海市民呈請中央取銷保證金制度，趙局長當即表示希望參議會正式動議，則公用局決可轉達。</p>
<h3>其故安在任用日員</h3>
<p>又陳伯良質詢：　公用局交通公司為何仍用日籍技術人員？二百六十元底薪是何根據？　交流公司法律顧問宋允惠何能兼任委員並兼籌備副主任？宋有何經驗？律師是否可做公務負？其四百三十元底薪及津貼根據何在？　會計主任經驗如何？原定底薪二百十元，爲何要給四百元？　章名　主任住屋一切費用何能由公家給付？</p>
<h3>因爲·人才·缺乏</h3>
<p>趙局長即逐一答覆：　日籍技術人員現有二名，乃經交通部核准者。該兩人現在　劍郊外無望電車，因我技術人才缺乏，政府以寬大胸懷任用之，亦似蘇聯之任用德人。　法律顧問因係需要，渠乃幫忙籌備，實際名義仍為顧問·其津貼等乃所給公費。　會計主任底薪原由市府核定二百八十元，因其能力很高，故請市府增至四百元。　章主任現居住屋乃公司宿舍，宿舍內一切設備當由公家供給。</p>
<h3>今日議程</h3>
<p>（本報訊）今日上午九時起，參會自治·衛生·預決算，法規，地政各委員會在參議會舉行小組會議，審査提案。公用組於十一時在招商局舉行。下午三時則開第四次會議，先由衛生局張局長，敎育局李代局長答覆質詢，繼即討論提案。</p>
<h3>土地登記證半年內辦完</h3>
<p>地政方面，質詢較少，王國賢等問，土地登記證遲不發給，何故？祝局長謂：土地登記已收到者十四萬七千，其中十二萬四千已審査，發證八萬四千，尙在審査者一萬二千餘。其中有須補手續者，有產權來源未査淸者，有產證遣失者，有未贖回產權者，有係逆產及有糾紛者，故未發證，在本年內決辦理完妥。</p>
<h3>馬路多洞何不勤修　浦東大道緣何不修　下柏油是否利用</h3>
<p>工務方面質詢，多數問馬路上洞穴為伺如此多？何以不多加條補？趙祖康局長答稱：修理道路材料飛漲，經費有限，故僅能將主要這路先修。陳培德，張志韓均問浦東大道為何至今不修。</p>
<p>答：巳計劃先修上南鐵路至東溝一段十七公里。至越江大橋，計劃已擬定，決建隧道式，但開工時期尙朱成熟。姜豪問剷下柏油是否利用？答：均全部利用，絕不浪費。侯雋人，張志韓皆謂蘇州河已成臭水浜，問題嚴重。答：已向　浦局交涉，儘量疏通。</p>

<h3>銀樓業大會複業尚有待</h3>
<p>（本報訊）自當局規定銀樓業復業辦法後，銀樓業公會為硏討有關復業之各項問題，昨在市商會大禮堂召開全體會員大會，並請社會局處長顧炳元蒞會解釋收兌飾金應行遵守事項七點：　金飾兌出之價格，依據中央銀行掛牌金價，酌加營業費用百分之四十，及合法利潤百分之二十，並得另加工資，惟一律不准掛牌。　金飾收進之價格，得視收件之作品，酌量補貼其工資，惟不得任意增高。　收進以金飾爲限，絕對不准收購金條　製金飾。　兌出亦以金飾為限，絕對不得以金飾熔條出售，兌出之金飾，每件不得超過二市兩。　金飾之收進取兌出，均應分別在　冊及發票上將費用逐一載明，以　積核。　如遇市面遇於波動，必須該訂價格時，應由公會函由社會局核准。　銀樓業全體理監事應以身作則，並監督所屬各會員間，應互相監視，如有違反上項情事，並應負責檢舉。旋共同討論自行禁止黑市賣買辦法，至復業問題，因營業上之實際困難尙待與當局再作商洽，且當局准許復業之命令尙未到達，故復業期恐尙有待。</p>
<p>兌付辦法</p>
<p>尚待核定</p>
<p>昨日市府奉財政部命令，對於上海銀樓金價兌付辦法，須呈由政院核定始准施行。市府已備文呈請政院核准備案，社會局並已轉知銀樓業同業公會知照矣。</p>

<h3>榆林路大紗廠房產　中信局處理經過詳情</h3>
<p>（本報訊〕自參政會駐委會提淸澈査中信局賤賣敵產後，記者頃自有關方面，獲悉此事之經過情形如下：</p>
<p>關於榆林路之　產，該處基地方原係業主陳仁濤向德德堂買受，該，約定租期至民四十二年底為止。期滿房屋歸於地主。迨民三十年一月廿二日，一大銀公司又將地上權　　與公火紗廠，該廠亦未能將房屋收回作偽工房，仍山原租戶居住。勝利後仍維持原狀，事實上完全由上海漁市塲及其他民戶居下，並無空屋。前紡管會於接收後，曾有公函致中信局，謂各戶即時遷讓，事實上不可能，但如承認既成事實，分戶出租，亦有未便。時適地主陳仁　　將合同內所存剩餘租期七年有餘之地上權，出資購回；經前敵　　業處理局審核，以上開地上權之存　期間既僅七年餘，現有房　中紡又不能使用，區區租金，無　爾庫。同時全部房屋結構，不適宜作工塲，且離公大紗廠達一哩之遙，無需與公大合併處理，因准由地主一次繳價，將地上權購回，但因各屋均有住戶，故原主所購回者，僅為收益續而非使用權、其應繳之價即七年餘之租金，扣除業主應負担之開支。租金之計算，經派員實地調査，三十四年七月每幢房屋之月租為偽幣三千元。一般統計，本年之房租約為民國三十四年之四倍。故榆林里每幢月租應為一萬二千元，每年為十四萬四千元，一百廿八幢　租共計一千八百四十三萬二千元，除扣經租開支百分之廿五外，房主純益為每年一千三百八十二萬四千元。如將七年租金一次付給，按年息七厘計算，應為七四，四五六，○六四元。按年息七厘，較黑市低二十倍，故淸理處對預扣之利息，顯已抑低。且照民三十四年之金價計算，當時每十兩折合偽幣六百二十萬元，勝利後最高黑市金價，亦遠在此數之上，足證前項房租照三十四年七月份偽幣數字四倍計算，顯未估低。常時命地主一次繳價結案，對於國庫收入無拱。又此項數字之決定，尙在劉攻芸局長任內，而由現任吳任滄局</p>
<p>關於一般敵偽產業之處理，敵偽房地產均為原始接收機關，如第三方面軍司令部，軍統局，上海市政府，德僑管理委員會及其他最初來滬之接收機關，然後再移交中信局。移交時均居住有人，現尙因無法騰空，致出售及應付政府機關需要，均感困難。居住者均按月付使用費，亦有機關及部隊拒交情形，均經該局呈報核辦。所有住戶情形及處理名册，曾於木月初交送來滬之監察委員。</p>
<p>關於暗收頂費一節，該局送交監委之又件中，建議請行政院考慮先行騰空佔住之人，以利標售，倘能如此辦埋，果有經辦人員暗頂等情，必可因出錢頂進者之申訴，而眞相大白。</p>
<p>關於產繼淸理加速辦理事，中信局以逆產斜紛較多，由法院裁定，案定後可迅速處理或發還業主云。</p>

<h3>電力職工遵令全體恢復工作</h3>
<p>吳局長希望循良工友·認清共匪陰謀無受惑</p>
<p>（中央社）上海電力公司全體職工於昨午接奉社會局限令，即刻復工命令後，下午三時，所有楊薄浦斐倫路等各廠及公司職工，已全都恢復工作。</p>
<p>昨晨該公司職工全部仍均到廠，除發電部門照常工作外其餘職工均未工作，致成意工狀態，社會局特命令電力公司產業工會，限令即刻復工，否則准許公司當局無條件開除不工作工人，幷解散該產業工會，是項命令送　後，所有職工已全體恢復工作。據社會局勞工處處長沈鼎語記者：電力公司被捕之吳可文等六人，均係反動有據經政府逮捕者，當不能與其他情形可比擬，更不能擅自罷工請願，且今（即昨）日怠工決定，係二十三日晚在社　局請願時，由理事會決定者，故顯係少數人操縱煽動，値此總動員時期，決不容許有煽動怠工罷工情形發生云。</p>
<p>（中央社）社會局長吳開先氏昨對警察局在富通印刷所捕獲電力公司工會內之共匪份子張仲之·吳可文等六人事發表談話云：一去年一月。本人接事之時，電力公司工人適在全部怠工之中，至二月十二日，局方召集勞資雙方，簽訂和解筆錄，其中有一條為「工會允向社會局及公司書面保證，以後如有勞資爭　事件，在調解或仲裁期問，依法決無怠工罷工行為。」乃一年以來，工潮迭起，且動輒怠工，其為不遵協定，昭然若揭。本人始終尊重勞工，對該公司工人屢次破壞諾言，無不曲加寬容，盡力調處。不意經此次警局發覺之後，始知該廠工潮之舉起，實係此少數共匪把持工會，作有計劃之破壞，顯見共匪在滬，欲使工業破產，工人失業，造成社會不安，陷於混亂，其後果將不堪設想。政府對於此種危害社會生存及人民生活之共匪份子，斷不姑息，定常採取嚴厲處置，余信大多數勞工及電力公司工人，均為安分循良之工友，徒以有少數陰謀份子，從中鼓動把持，致中其計。今者事實既明，深盼諸工友認淸共匪險謀，幸勿受其　惑，而附和盲從，遭致自身之失　痛苦。</p>

<p>搜得勾結共匪證件</p>
<p>（中央社）此次軍警機關出動逮捕本市潛伏共匪份子，先後捕獲吳可文等十三名，並搜獲彼等與共匪之往來文件計有十餘件，昨據各該機關發表彼寧與共匪勾結之證件如下：　中國共產黨中央委員會發佈紀念「七七」十週年對時局口號。　中共二十週年感言。　中國勞動協會，上海工人協會，上海職業界協會，上海機製國貨工廠工聯誼會，上海市中區各業職工人掖保障委員曾，滬東區工人民主促進會，滬西各廠職工聯誼會，卅六年八月三日所發「上海職工團體為揭破「總動員令」陰謀聯合宣言」。　蘇州人力軍罷工總動員。　工潮特輯。及　九月十日指示等共計十二件。</p>

<h3>張羣在東北談三寶</h3>
<p>（本報瀋陽廿一日航訊）張舉飛來了，他對東北表示出特別的情深，他在學生時代，在日本社會黨人白輝家中，見到邊川博士一篇論文，題為「日本在滿　的的權利」，常時即為東北的安全隱憂。他對權陽市民說：我們東北有三寶：人參，貂皮，烏拉草。現在這三賓在那裏呢？</p>
<p>國家也有三寳，那就是土地，人民，主權，而現在土地人民還沒有究全收復，主權也沒有完整，還有什麽寳貝在自己的懷抱裏呢？他提出了很深刻的問體，中央決定切執行東北工業化的國策。他在三天之內，願意多看，多聽，多講，與東北人士共同澈底了解東北的現實環境。張氏自稱是中央與地方的橋樑，他代表巾央完全信賴陳兼主任，完全與東北民衆息相關地　念與愛撫。</p>
<p>張氏對記者談話，態度誠懇坦白，毫無保留，像記者的老朋友一樣，他掩飾不住對東北的熱情，他說：光緒三十三年第一次來東北，為了轉道日本贖書，民國十八年第二次來東北，請張學良與中央合作，現在是第二次來東北，他本想「九一八」趕到，因參加中央集會，運了一天。「九一八」使他</p>
<p>對歷史的回憶</p>
<p>感到興趣，也感到沉痛！他說：九一八改變了中國的歷史，而且引起第二次世界大戰，歷史證明，東北的安危，不僅關係國家的生存，與世界安全相關，收復東北，建設東北，保障國家獨立自由的國策，永久不變。他提出中國古代政治哲學的兩句名言：「民為邦本，本固邦寗」，昭示東北同胞，以「祟法務實」四字，勉勵東北同胞，做新人，勵行新生活，造成新風氣，負起新使命。</p>
<p>當東北局面正從舊的階段轉變為新階段的過程中，張羣到東北來可說是一件大事。他帶給東北人民的希冀與欣慰　够多。他恐怕是民國以來</p>
<p>第一個到東北</p>
<p>的行政院長。陳誠兼主東北軍政以米，只看見雷厲風行的整風運動，取消東北特殊化問題，尙在幕後策劃，怎樣進行，中央保持愼重。此次張羣首次表示他對東北幣制的意見：改革東北幣制問題，中央還沒有考慮，因為當初為安定東北經濟，才發行流通券，今日要考慮改變，首先要考慮這個問題。張氏在這一問題上表示的意見，正是取消東北特殊化問題的最好的測驗。（記者趙展）</p>

<h3>Principles for Handling Imported Goods Purchased with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Finalized; Awaiting Approval and Implementation by the Executive Yuan's Provisional Meeting</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] The handling measures for imported goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange were previously discussed in detail at the Executive Yuan meeting. On the 24th, the Executive Yuan convened a special review subcommittee meeting involving relevant agencies. Several principles were finalized, to be submitted for discussion at the provisional Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th. Implementation will follow approval. The key points of these principles are as follows: After the government announces the regulations for the automatic declaration of overseas deposits by citizens, self-provided foreign exchange must be automatically declared to the national banks and transfer procedures completed. Following this procedure and with the approval of the national banks, imported goods can be purchased. Self-provided foreign exchange that has not been declared to the national banks will not be permitted for use. In this way, the government can control all foreign exchange. In principle, the self-provided foreign exchange used for imported goods frozen by the Shanghai Customs will be unfrozen. However, luxury items on the import ban list, such as automobiles and lipsticks, will not be allowed to be imported. Other materials specially permitted for import will be subject to heavy taxation based on the severity of the circumstances before being allowed to be imported. The meeting today was chaired by Finance Minister Yu Hung-chun. A report on the total value of the self-provided foreign exchange used for imported goods frozen by the Shanghai Customs was presented, stating that it was only US$4 million, refuting the rumor of US$100 million. Furthermore, over 70% of these goods were unlisted items such as machinery, newsprint, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, and raw materials for the film industry. The Ministry of Finance has proposed a tax rate of 50% to 100%. The discussions at today's meeting were based on the provisions of Article 9 of the "Regulations for the Management of Import and Export Trade," which states that "importers must not engage in ordering goods from abroad before obtaining an import permit." Therefore, a decision was made on how to handle importers who directly order goods from abroad using self-provided foreign exchange, as described above.</p>
<h3>Increased Allocation of Compensation Materials to Private Institutions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] It is reported that the compensation materials allocated to private institutions have been increased from the original 32,000 tons to 120,000 tons. The detailed allocation method will be decided at a meeting in the near future.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] The Compensation Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 24th to discuss increasing the amount of compensation materials allocated to private institutions. Chairman Wang Yun-wu presided over the meeting, with Gan Nai-guang, Qin Fen, and others in attendance. During the meeting, it was noted that the originally requested 480,000 tons might not be fully met due to the adoption of a lottery method. Due to the reduction in the total amount, the originally determined allocations to various units, especially the materials allocated to private factories, would be reduced. It was deemed necessary to allocate a portion of the materials to be distributed to various government agencies. The meeting decided that the Review Committee should convene the Ministry of Transportation, the National Resources Commission, the Ministry of National Defense, and other agencies to jointly discuss this matter.</p>
<h3>President Zhang Inspects the Shijingshan Steel and Power Plant Yesterday and Listens to Work Reports from Hebei and Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] President Zhang Qun attended the morning meeting of the Beiping Municipal Government at 7:45 AM on the 24th. In his address to the municipal government personnel, he stated that Beiping is not only a historical city where culture and civilization converge but also the spiritual capital of the Chinese people today. However, due to the people of Beiping's historical habit of stability, they tend to be somewhat passive. He encouraged everyone to strive for legalism and pragmatism, and to promote public virtue. "Legalism" means knowing and abiding by the law, while "pragmatism" means speaking truthfully, doing practical work, and having a sincere and down-to-earth approach. Revitalizing morale and promoting public virtue is the shared responsibility of officials and the public. The New Life Movement advocated by President Chiang Kai-shek in the past is a shortcut to promoting public virtue. Recently, the government has promulgated austerity measures, aiming to use government orders to supervise the implementation of the New Life Movement. The municipal government, as the executor of government orders, bears an even greater responsibility. He hoped that the municipal government personnel would encourage each other and work together to achieve the goal of building Beiping. After the address, accompanied by Director Li Zongren of the Executive Yuan, Vice Chairman Sun Yueqi of the National Resources Commission, and Political Commissioner Peng Xuepei, he went to the North China Iron and Steel Plant of the National Resources Commission and the power plant of the North Hebei Electric Power Company in Shijingshan, west of Beiping, at 9:00 AM for inspection. Director Zhu Yulun of the steel plant and General Manager Bao Guobin of the North Hebei Electric Power Company led the tour and explained the internal organization. President Zhang inquired extensively about the reconstruction work of the two plants and promised to consider ways to solve the various difficulties. He returned to the city at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. From 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, he listened to work reports from the Hebei Provincial Government and the Beiping Municipal Government. At 7:30 PM in the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Director Li. On the 24th, he inspected Yenching University and Tsinghua University in the morning, and attended a welcome reception organized by various agencies and organizations in the afternoon. After the meeting, he planned to host professors from colleges and universities. He will leave Beiping for Tianjin on the 26th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 24th] President Zhang attended the work report meeting of the municipal government at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 24th. Director Zeng of the Bureau of Education presented plans to President Zhang regarding the relief of out-of-school youth, improving teachers' salaries, increasing funding, and repairing school buildings.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Huang Xian-guang, Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, stated at a press conference on the 24th in response to reporters' questions: "President Zhang's current tour of the north aims to inspect and inquire about the suffering of the people, and to examine whether local governments are thoroughly implementing national policies and government orders and whether their work is coordinated. He will also inspect industrial and mining enterprises. President Zhang himself has explained the purpose. However, President Zhang's trip to the Northeast before going to Beiping and Tianjin indicates the government's special emphasis on the Northeast, as the Northeast is the most precious and cherished part of our entire territory."</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guihua, 24th] President Zhang may come to Suiyuan in the future, and preparations for his welcome are underway here.</p>
<h3>Military and Official Supervisory Group Sends Letter to President Zhang Requesting Assistance in Rectification Work</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 24th] The members of the Military and Official Supervisory Group visited President Zhang this morning but did not meet him. They then sent a letter to President Zhang, explaining the group's past work and requesting Zhang's active assistance in the group's work. They requested that the measures for improving military discipline and rectification previously submitted to the central government be implemented and requested instructions for judicial organs to strictly handle the cases already investigated by the group.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Hosts Banquet for Provincial and Municipal Leaders in Shenyang Official Residence</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Changchun, 24th] Chen Cheng convened a meeting with provincial and municipal leaders of the unrecovered areas in Shenyang at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of advancing offices to areas close to the unrecovered territories. Several agencies in Changchun are already seeking sites for offices.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Shenyang, 24th] After the resignation of Changchun Mayor Zhao Jun, Sun Gui-ji, the current mayor of Lushun, has been internally designated as his replacement and will be officially announced soon. At 6:00 PM on the 24th, Chen Cheng hosted a banquet at his official residence for the leaders of nine provinces and two cities to discuss matters.</p>
<h3>Nomination of Candidates; Various Parties Consult Separately</h3>
<p>Youth Party Denies Conditional Nomination</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] The three-party consultation on the nomination of candidates by political parties did not take place on the 24th. The Democratic and Youth Parties have been holding internal meetings every night for several days to discuss the nomination issue. Kuomintang members are scheduled to meet at Sun Ke's residence on the 25th to discuss the matter, with a follow-up meeting on the 26th.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] According to Youth Party sources: "Negotiations on opening up local government positions are still ongoing in Nanjing. The Youth Party has made requests for positions such as department heads, commissioners, county magistrates, and middle school principals. However, the rumor of demanding a chairman position is likely untrue. As for the number and scope of requests, there was a past agreement of '3:1:1.' This principle should apply not only to the central government but also to local governments. However, opening up local government positions and submitting a list of candidates for the general election are two separate matters. Therefore, the claim that the list was rejected due to unmet demands is not credible."</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guihua, 23rd] In the election of Mongol banners and Chinese people, the central government allows the right to vote but not the right to be elected. It is reported that there are 200,000 Chinese people in the seven banners of the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan, while there are only 20,000 Mongol people. The Chinese people in each banner are brewing a boycott of the election.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Government Committee Member Bao Erhan, accompanied by Director Zhang Zhizhong, along with Yimin, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department, visited the President at 5:30 PM on the 23rd to report on the recent situation in Xinjiang Province. The President stated that the entire country is currently focusing all efforts on implementing the suppression of the rebellion. Once this task is completed, he will do his best to assist in the completion of Xinjiang's construction plan. The President also stated that education and health in Xinjiang Province today are extremely important. He has personally instructed the relevant authorities to immediately send people to Xinjiang to establish a well-equipped and comprehensive hospital and a university. Bao and his party left at 6:00 PM. According to Bao, Xinjiang Province's five-year plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3>Zhang Fakui Arrives in Hong Kong</h3>

<h3>President Summons Han Zhongshi</h3>

<h3>The Work of the British Friends Service Unit in China</h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London, 24th] Mr. Johnstone recently published an article, "The Work of the Friends Service Unit," which provides a detailed review of British aid organizations in China. The article states: "With the global war having ended, the emergency situation in China caused by the war has been partially alleviated. Consequently, the Friends Ambulance Unit in China ended in March 1946. After a meeting to continue the project of this organization until the autumn of 1946, the 'Friends Service Unit to China' was formally established. Its organization is similar to the Friends Ambulance Unit, and its members share the same views on peace and war as members of the Quaker Church. It is also a volunteer organization. Each member must have language training and receive a stipend for separate use, and must work in the field for at least two years. Currently, the unit's work has three major categories: medical relief, post-war reconstruction, and training and education. A type of black fever is prevalent in North China, which is transmitted by sandflies and can cause fever and death in malnourished people within one to two weeks. The Service Unit is working independently in a part of Henan Province. A diagnostic team consisting of one British public health physician and two experimental technicians travels from village to village in the area to identify patients, followed by a treatment team that provides patients with the necessary injections. The purpose of this work is to systematically eliminate black fever from a large area, so that there is no fear of sandflies spreading it. Other medical work is carried out in small hospitals, supplemented by a relief program that includes the establishment of kindergartens and people's education classes, the distribution of milk to children, and some preliminary hygiene, the promotion of cooperative enterprises such as cotton planting, flour milling, oil pressing, and sawmilling, and the gradual teaching of new varieties of plants and animals and improved breeding methods. Regarding its third category of work, two projects have been implemented for several months. One is a medical mechanical training school, with courses in basic hospital engineering and maintenance, water supply, plumbing, and sanitation, and protection of generators and electric light lines. The other is the provision of two members to teach at Shanghai University, one national and one church-run, to provide opportunities for mutual contact with the Shanghai Friends Service Center."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Donation of Assets; Key Directors of the Construction Bank to Hold Discussion Meeting Tomorrow</h3>

It is reported that the key directors of the company are Qian Xin-zhi, Zhang Jia-ao, Chen Guangfu, Li Fu-sun, and Ye Fu-xiao.</p>
<h3>Shamian Concession in Guangzhou to be Developed as Cultural District; Municipal Government Establishes Cultural Committee for Planning</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guangzhou, 24th] The Guangzhou Shamian Concession, which we have recovered, has a tranquil construction and beautiful scenery. The Guangzhou Municipal Government has decided to designate the area as a Guangzhou cultural district and has established a Cultural Affairs Committee to be responsible for designing, reviewing, awarding, and managing public cultural undertakings and funds. All public assets in Shamian are allocated to the Cultural Committee for management, and all proceeds are allocated to the cultural undertaking fund. A large-scale scientific research center, library, theater, cultural apartments, etc. will be established within it. All cultural institutions in the city can request the allocation of building sites.</p>
<p>United Press Correction: In the United Press Chinese manuscript of the 23rd, a New York dispatch of the 22nd reported that the Christian Methodist Church announced that "President Chiang has donated his land and houses in Chongqing to the church for use as a school and orphanage, covering an area of over 10,000 mu." The character "万" (ten thousand) was a transcription error of "百" (hundred).</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Instructs Three Principles for Restoring Trade with Korea; First Ascertain Attitudes of US and South Korea, Then Formulate Detailed Measures</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Regarding the restoration of trade with Korea, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission previously received repeated joint petitions from representatives of overseas Chinese in Korea, including Zhou Shen-jiu. The Commission has successively sent letters to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant agencies for handling. The Executive Yuan has now issued a telegram approving the following three principles: 1. It is indeed necessary to consider opening up Sino-Korean trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should first ascertain the attitudes and policies of both the United States and South Korea within a set period, and then formulate detailed measures for navigation and trade to adapt to the situation. 2. All goods belonging to overseas Chinese in Korea that have been detained and fall under the category of temporarily suspended imports should be released upon payment of supplementary taxes. 3. Before the official opening of Sino-Korean trade, overseas Chinese in Korea who continue to apply for importing goods in the future, except for those listed as prohibited imports, should be allowed to declare customs and pay taxes for release. Exports will be temporarily suspended. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has forwarded these measures to major overseas Chinese organizations in Korea for their information. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that, standing from the perspective of the interests of overseas Chinese, the ban on Sino-Korean trade should be lifted as soon as possible, and regular relations should be restored.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] According to personnel from the Industry Group of the Allied General Headquarters in Japan, seven Japanese-made locomotives, forty-two freight cars, and two boilers will be shipped to China in the near future. Another twenty locomotives are under construction and are expected to be completed between December and March next year. Part of the former has been packaged and will be shipped to China by sea within a few days. However, due to the fact that China and Japan have not yet agreed on the final price of the railway equipment, the loading may be delayed. This railway equipment includes seven locomotives of two different types, ten flatbed freight cars, and thirty-two other types of freight cars. The former Chinese representative in Tokyo went to inspect these vehicles and found that their quality was inferior to the points listed in the Chinese specifications. According to headquarters personnel, all shortcomings have now been corrected one by one according to Chinese suggestions. The other twenty locomotives under construction are part of the 300 locomotives and 3,000 freight cars that China and Japan negotiated and ordered a year ago. According to the production plan, Japan will be able to produce five locomotives per month from December to March next year.</p>

<h3>American Reporter Travels in Shandong and Reveals the Mysteries of the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>American Scripps-Howard newspaper reporter W. H. Newton sent a dispatch from Shandong County on September 9, describing a glimpse of the recent situation in the Communist-controlled areas. The original text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>"Visiting many contested cities and war zones damaged by war in China, and talking to soldiers and ordinary people, allows us to uncover several mysteries about the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese National Government.</p>
<p>"The first mystery: the assumption that the Communist Party is probably very popular with ordinary Chinese people, poor farmers and villagers. But the fact is: as far as the territory in Shandong is concerned, the Communist Party is not only greatly feared by the rich, but also greatly feared by the poor.</p>
<p>"For example, Yidu, which was occupied by the Communist Party for the past six months, saw all commercial activity cease, all shops close, and church schools and hospitals sealed off during the occupation. A large number of people fled elsewhere. This situation is the same in Linchu and many other villages!</p>
<p>"The second mystery! The assumption that the Communist Party army is the "people's army," meaning that it is the common farmer's resistance to the National Government. I have spoken to many Communist prisoners of war captured by the Kuomintang in the Battle of Linchu, and almost none of them understand the meaning of "communism." Most of them were forced to join and forced to fight. A small number of them were originally Kuomintang soldiers who were captured in previous battles and forced to fight against the government.</p>
<p>"The third mystery: the assumption that the Communist Party allows any degree of religious freedom in the areas they control. This is only the exception in those few cities with foreign missionaries, because they may report the situation. But even in these cases, religious rituals are hindered and Chinese pastors are persecuted and humiliated.</p>
<p>"Chinese Presbyterian and Baptist pastors are often accused of being "American spies" and deported. Catholics, in general, are particularly persecuted.</p>
<p>"For example, in Chinchik, the Communist Party stormed into a Catholic church, took away everything of value, and compensated the German priest about five US cents for the damage. In Changchia, the Chinese Presbyterian pastor was forced to flee and their homes were destroyed at will.</p>
<p>"Communist political instructors in Changtuan collected Bibles distributed by the Presbyterian pastor and burned them. In Shawo, the Communist Party tried to force the Presbyterian pastor to order the church's clergy to attend Communist Party meetings; he refused. Of the fifty Presbyterian churches in the Weixian area, only four—those in the Kuomintang area—can still worship freely.</p>
<p>"In all the villages and towns in northern Shandong Province, Christian pastors have been imprisoned by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>"The fourth mystery: the assumption that the attractive land reform plan has won the farmers' inclination towards the Communist Party. It is true that the Communist Party confiscated the land of the landlords and distributed it to the farmers on several occasions, but then, the Communist Party imposed heavy taxes on them, requisitioned all the harvests to feed the Communist Party's army, and forced the farmers who accepted the land to join the army.</p>
<p>"There is little respect for political freedom and human rights anywhere in China, and in the Communist Party areas, there is absolutely no respect for political freedom and human rights, except occasionally in some "show places" that allow foreigners to visit.</p>
<p>"Although the Communist Party leaders are completely ruthless in pursuing their political goals, they are generally less traditional in their corrupt practices than the officials of the National Government. However, there are obvious exceptions to this criticism of National Government officials.</p>
<p>"One of the exceptions is Major General Chang Tien-tso, Commissioner of the Eighth Administrative District of Shandong. General Chang is 40 years old, a tall and cheerful figure. With the entire Eighth Administrative District under Communist Party control, General Chang organized a cooperative relief committee, chartered airplanes, brought in supplies, and transported out local products. Merchants transporting goods out of the territory are taxed according to the value of the goods, and the proceeds are used to maintain the lives of the millions of refugees who have fled from the Communist Party army.</p>
<p>"He organized a school for middle-aged women to teach them hygiene and basic medical knowledge. He collected textbooks and opened rural primary schools in the district. He obtained DDT to kill pests in the countryside. The Communist Party has never been able to step into the villages he manages. The Jiaoji Railway, which passes through his area, has never been sabotaged by Communist guerrillas; it is the only remaining section that can still operate daily, about 40 kilometers.</p>
<p>"It is true that the Kuomintang army also levies taxes on the villages when passing through. This seems to be a cruel necessity for both sides of the war. However, in Shandong Province, at least, when the Communist Party captures a city, the people flee, and when the Kuomintang recovers it, the people return.</p>
<p>"The Communist Party's propaganda often sounds very good, but this is the reality!"</p>
<h3>Preliminary Agreement Reached Between China and the United States for $30 Million in Relief Supplies; 50,000 Tons of British Bridge Equipment Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: The draft agreement on U.S. aid supplies to China has been under continuous discussion by representatives from the Ministry and the U.S. Embassy for several days and has reached a preliminary agreement. Both parties are requesting government approval. According to the agreement, the U.S. intends to provide China with relief in the form of food, medicines, seeds, and fertilizers, totaling approximately $30 million, with food accounting for the largest portion.</p>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 24th] When the current restoration plan is fully realized, 98% of China's telecommunications equipment will be supplied by the United Kingdom. Equipment such as telephones, telegraph transmitters, and broadcasting equipment will almost entirely come from the UK. The reporting machines and broadcasting equipment include facilities to reach all parts of the world, as well as equipment solely for local communication business. The above equipment was ordered from the United Kingdom through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration after China considered and determined that British equipment was the best. The British industry has so far undertaken to deliver a large number of Chinese orders.</p>
<p>The assistance that the United Kingdom is supplying to China for reconstruction is not limited to telecommunications equipment. The UK is currently shipping 50,000 tons of bridge equipment to China, which is equivalent to 80% of China's total needs. Simultaneously shipped to China with the bridge equipment are two complete railway repair plants, encompassing everything from square sheds to tools, sufficient to handle the heaviest fire. In addition, there is a large batch of smaller tools capable of establishing 78 automobile repair shops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] When reporters inquired with General Wedemeyer about his reported recommendation to President Truman that economic assistance to China be utilized under strict U.S. supervision, Wedemeyer replied that he was not at liberty to discuss the matter before his report was published. He stated that he had spoken with Secretary of State Marshall for two hours yesterday when the Secretary returned to Washington to confer with the President and senior officials. Wedemeyer continued, saying that he would meet with President Truman on the 25th. It is understood that only a summary of Wedemeyer's report will be released, and the full text will not be published.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 23rd] Former Undersecretary of State Welles wrote in the commentary column edited by Zhang Sheng in the New York Herald Tribune, stating that the Wedemeyer fact-finding mission to China was a serious mistake. Welles stated that the CCP had called the Wedemeyer mission to China a clear demonstration of American interference in China's sovereign affairs. A dangerous rift has now occurred between Washington and Nanjing. This is the result of the Wedemeyer investigation mission to China. Welles also pointed out significant errors made by the United States in Greece, the Paris Conference, and Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] World Bank Vice President Garner stated today that while the World Bank considers the economic recovery of Europe as its most important work, it is also eager to assist Latin America, Asia, and other countries. When Garner met with reporters today, he mentioned the equalization loan issue that the Chinese government had previously expressed interest in. He said that while the Bank has the right to make such loans, he could not answer reporters' questions about what actions the Bank would take regarding applications thereafter. Garner also stated that the Bank's actions would be coordinated with those of the U.S. Congress.</p>

<h3>Deng Wenyi Reports on Recent Military Affairs: Communist Bandits in Jiaodong Can Be Cleared Within Ten Days; Liu Bandit Already Encircled and Not Difficult to Eliminate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, attended a press conference held by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan at 5:00 PM on the 24th, reporting on military affairs, providing explanations on the Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Chen Yi, and Jiaodong fronts, one by one. The Fifth Column under Liu Bocheng's command has lost more than half of its strength. After suffering heavy losses, the 1st and 7th Columns merged and are now fleeing in small groups. This unit has suffered significant ammunition losses in Guangshan and Luotian. Initially, the unit possessed 5,000 oxcarts of ammunition, but now less than half remains. Chen Geng's unit crossed the Henan River southward, originally intending to join with the northward fleeing Liu Bocheng unit, but immediately after crossing the river, it was intercepted by the National Army, preventing it from advancing. It is currently in the area east of Shanzhou and has suffered heavy losses. The 1st, 4th, and 8th Columns under Chen Yi's command crossed from western Shandong, while another unit crossed the river northward from the Jiaoji Railway. The total strength of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns is no more than 40,000 men. They have lost more than half of their strength in the past two weeks. The National Army troops on the Longhai Railway have been reinforced and should not pose a problem. The Political Committee of the Third Column sent a report to Chen Yi, detailing their reluctance to fight and the lack of ammunition and food, and calling themselves the "Escapee Column," which reveals the general morale of the army. In the Jiaodong region, the National Army is intensifying its offensive, led by Xu Shiyou of the Ninth Column. We are now less than 60 kilometers from Yantai, so the Communist bandits in the Jiaodong area can be cleared within ten days. In this way, the Communist bandits have had their retreat cut off, and the bandits south of the Yellow River will also find it difficult to escape their fate of annihilation. Director Deng generally reported on city and town gains and losses from September 15th to 21st, stating: Guangji fell on the 15th, and we captured Qishui; Huangmei fell on the 16th, and we captured Yingshan; the situation in Qianshan and Susong was unclear on the 17th, and we captured Huangmei and Guangji; Guangshan and Luotian fell on the 18th, and we captured Liuan and Shucheng; on the 20th, we captured Huangshan, Guangshan, and Luotian; on the 21st, we captured Lujiang (in Anhui province); Shangcheng was relieved on the 22nd, and the situation in Gushi was unclear. The bandits have gathered 6,000 to 7,000 troops in the area between Guangshan, Jingfu, and Shangcheng. There are no large bandit forces between the Luotian highway and railway. Currently, the Liu bandit is encircled by the National Army on all sides, making it not difficult to eliminate them in the near future.</p>
<h3>War-Weariness, Desertion, Pessimism, and Laxity: The Tragic Fate of Chen Yi's Bandit Troops Exposed Without a Trace in the "Political Commissar" Report</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The "Political Commissar" of the Third Column of Chen Yi's Communist Bandit troops, Wang Danian, submitted a report to Chen on the "General Ideological Situation in the Army" and attitudes towards combat, consisting of over 2,000 characters in full. It was captured by our Fifth Division near Yucheng. The report fully expresses dissatisfaction with Chen Yi and phenomena of morale decline and pessimism. Records of desertions are also numerous. This is truly a "propaganda item" of a bandit army in decline. Here are some notes: Daily life consists mostly of marching, and water is encountered everywhere, so everyone has rotten feet, and there is a lack of food, often subsisting on raw sweet potatoes. There are many deserting soldiers. Since the Tenth Column went from central Shandong to the Yu-Lu area, statistics show that there have been 2,000 deserters, so it has now been downsized. Regarding the ideological situation, since the Third Column failed in the Jinning battle, due to the annihilation of five companies and the complete injury or death of seven companies, the concrete reflections after the battle include four kinds of emotions: (A) Complaining: There is widespread complaining up, down, left, and right about Commander Chen, resenting his subjectivism. Cadres at the regimental level believe that it was originally an excellent annihilation battle, but the higher-ups did not handle it well. At the same time, they complain about insufficient ammunition and poor command; they resent the political workers for boasting because during mobilization they said that as long as we surround the city, we don't necessarily have to fight into it, saying that the remnants of the 72nd Division were at most two regiments, with only three cannons, one of which couldn't even fire. (B) Pessimism: Most soldiers don't eat and look for villagers everywhere. When they see family members injured or killed, they wail and cry, or sleep like the dead all day long. Some cry and say, "Only I am left!" Some veteran soldiers eat and drink heavily, and they don't believe we can win the counteroffensive. They say that after we eliminate the 26th Division, another 26th Division comes, and after we eliminate the 72nd Division, another 72nd Division comes, so something can never be accomplished, and they are deserting in large numbers. Thirty men from the 22nd Regiment of the Eighth Division left overnight, and individual special agents took the opportunity to act, carrying machine guns and running away. (C) Laxity: Cadres ignore problems such as desertion and violations of the law. A platoon leader said that being a platoon leader and leading thirty-two soldiers on a march, he really doesn't feel like it; Yang Honghui, a political instructor in the 27th Regiment, cries loudly and doesn't ask about work. (D) Waiting for reorganization. The above four emotions are very common, and general thinking is very confused, especially expressing inclined emotions. Some people say, "If you can't beat them to death, run them to death; if you can't run them to death, starve them to death." Thirty-four members of the Fourth Company captured from the 30th Regiment organized a group and ran away with five guns, two of whom were party members. Someone said, "Counterattack, counterattack, we lost Shandong!" The Third Column calls itself the "Escapee Column" because they are being chased closely from behind; discipline in the 32nd Regiment is even worse, hitting and scolding local cadres, demanding food, civilian laborers are forced to buy things and are forced to pull livestock, and there are separate rapes, etc. According to Lai Shaoqi, discipline is too bad, there is no way to do political work, propaganda work is finished, and now we can only use heads to maintain it. Others say that Commander Chen calculated everything, but didn't calculate food and shoes for walking. Finally, he makes two requests: A clear strategic policy and Replenishment and rest. Not signed "Your Officer, Da Nian, September 13."</p>
<h3>Hefei Order Returns to Normal</h3>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Ten-Year Plan for University Education</h3>
<p>— Hu Xiansu</p>
<p>Hu Shi, President of Peking University, recently published his proposed ten-year education plan to the authorities, which has attracted attention from all parties. Zou Lu, a member of the National Government, concerned about Sun Yat-sen University, sent an open letter to Hu, inquiring whether the Sun Yat-sen University he mentioned was referring to National Central University or Sun Yat-sen University. Chen Xujing, Dean of Studies at Nankai University, expressed disagreement with Hu's proposal to completely abolish studying abroad. There are also many other people in the education field who have written articles discussing this issue. It can be seen that this issue is valued by all sectors of the country; therefore, I also want to express my personal opinions to discuss with the people of the country.</p>
<p>Hu's proposal that the government should specially cultivate the five national universities of Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Wuhan University, and Central University within two five-year periods is not unreasonable. These five schools can indeed be called the best universities in the country, but to say that only these five schools are worthy of special cultivation by the government, there is room for discussion. For example, Jiaotong University has been the most famous engineering university in the country for decades, and its library and mechanical equipment are very abundant. Its academic status is no less than that of the five universities such as Peking University; isn't Jiaotong University worthy of special cultivation by the government? Sun Yat-sen University used to be the largest in scale among the national universities, with the most abundant library equipment. Its College of Agriculture and College of Medicine are quite famous, and the Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Botany, presided over by Professor Chen Huan, has long been internationally renowned as the most famous institution for studying Chinese plant taxonomy. The number of its specimens and books is second only to the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute, which the five universities mentioned by Hu cannot match. Unfortunately, generally speaking, the discipline is slightly lax, and the academic atmosphere is not very strong, and in this war of resistance, the books and specimens were almost completely lost. However, this is a university commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen, with a large scale and a glorious history in the past. The government should actively reorganize it and cultivate it specially, making it the first-class university in southern China. I believe that in addition to these seven universities that the government declares to cultivate specially, it must also pay attention to cultivating several other universities, such as Normal University, Northeast University, Fudan University, Jinan University, Tongji University, Sichuan University, Zhongzheng University, Nankai University, Xiamen University, and Hunan University, taking those with a long history or colleges with a long-standing reputation in the past. In the first ten-year plan, the government may not have the power to cultivate these ten schools especially, but it must also enrich their teachers and library equipment to bring them up to the general level of European and American universities. As for Taiwan University, it has substantial library equipment, but it must enrich its teachers so that it can maintain its level during the Japanese management period. In addition, other universities can only be taken care of in the second ten-year plan. However, China has great potential. If politics is on track and industrialization is in progress, then national power will grow rapidly. Perhaps in less than ten years, not only will the government be able to improve other universities, but it can also add many new universities. The Soviet Union has been established for only twenty years, and there are more than 780 universities and more than 1,000 research institutes in its country. How can China be so far away from it forever? If so, how can we build a country? What about the so-called catching up?</p>
<p>Secondly, when talking about the ten-year university education plan, don't neglect research institutions. Hu said that universities drink thin porridge, wouldn't research institutions drink thin porridge? The Academia Sinica is the highest research institution in the country, and its funding is not abundant. The funding of the Peiping Research Institute is tight, which is even more unimaginable. Other public and private research institutions are also in a difficult situation. University funding is inherently large. In the near future, it will not be possible to establish large-scale research institutes. It is necessary to expand existing public and private research institutions as much as possible and link them closely with universities, so that within their specialized research scope, they can guide the students of university research institutes, so that universities can obtain the best senior mentors and can use the picture equipment and specimens of the research institutes without having to prepare them themselves. On the research institute side, it can also ensure that research and education are not separated, and can cultivate talents in the science that this institution specializes in research, avoiding the lament of talent shortage, so that both parties can benefit from it. This layer has not been achieved in the past. Now, the various institutes of the Academia Sinica have a proposal to cooperate with Central University. In the future, the government should actively encourage this kind of mutually beneficial cooperation.</p>
<p>As for the current policy on studying abroad, it is not perfect. A large number of public and private students are not fully prepared in the country, and even the preparation of foreign languages is not certain. They only plan to go abroad for gilding, wasting a lot of foreign exchange, which is unwise. However, absolutely prohibiting studying abroad, preventing students from obtaining the opportunity to conduct research that domestic universities cannot lead, in order to complete their personal learning goals and adapt to the needs of the country, is not a long-term solution. I think it is okay to impose stricter restrictions on studying abroad. Reduce the quota of public and private students by two-thirds of the current number, and stipulate that only university professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, or research institute personnel can go abroad for research; and then stipulate that the top-tier universities and public and private research institutions should enrich research equipment as soon as possible, recruit more research students, and after they have completed their studies, even let them take the national doctoral examination. Only after they have obtained a doctorate can they be sent to famous foreign universities to study for one or two years, so that those who are cultivated are truly first-class scholars and will not waste public and private wealth.</p>
<p>University education was quite abnormal during the Anti-Japanese War. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been over for two years, it has not been reorganized, which is not right. The current constitution stipulates that 15% of the total national budget should be used for education, science, and culture, which must be implemented from the 37th year. On the one hand, increase a large amount of funding, and on the other hand, reduce the funding for studying abroad by two-thirds, so that universities and research institutions can be enriched as much as possible, so that they can actively improve. Then universities and public and private research institutions can complete their tasks without drinking porridge, and Chinese academics can be independent.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Announces Two Measures to Stop Disrupting Finance; Passengers to Guangdong and Fujian Limited to Carrying 500,000 Legal Tender</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] The Taiwan Provincial Government has announced two measures regarding the financial problems it faces. This was decided before Wei Daoming went to Beijing. It is heard that there is another measure that can only be published after consulting with the Ministry of Finance. The two measures announced are: first, the Ministry of Finance stipulates that each person carrying legal tender from the mainland to the ports of Fujian and Guangdong shall not exceed 500,000; otherwise, it will be confiscated. Many merchants carry legal tender from Shanghai to Taiwan and then make profits by arbitrage, resulting in illegal black market exchange of legal tender in Taiwan Province recently, disrupting finance. The Taiwan authorities have decided to strictly stop this and have begun to inspect the amount of legal tender carried by passengers to Fujian and Guangdong at various ports in Taiwan Province. If it exceeds 500,000 yuan, the excess amount will be confiscated. The second measure is to prohibit all public and private firms engaged in the silver and money industry from engaging in deposit and loan and remittance businesses, especially public and private firms engaged in the remittance and exchange business of legal tender and Taiwan dollars, which will be strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3>Liang Huasheng, Pan Yukun, and Others Return to Changchun Together from Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 24th] Liang Huasheng, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, Pan Yukun, Commander of the New First Army, and Li Hong, Commander of the 38th Division, flew back to Changchun together today. They have a firm belief in the security of the Jilin-Changchun area. According to their talk with our reporter: The autumn harvest is approaching, and small groups of Communist bandits are coming out to loot grain. The National Army has made arrangements to protect the autumn harvest and strive to reduce losses for farmers. The National Army's assault teams are used in coordination with strategic maneuvers, accumulating small victories into large victories, and the results are quite large. Recently, sporadic bandits in northern Changchun are purely harassing and are not worth worrying about. The safety of Changchun and the Changchun-Jilin traffic can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] The re-trial of Pan Yugui, a major traitor in North China, took place at the Capital High Court at 2:30 PM on the 24th.

The inside was just about managing hygiene and night watchmen. Did you issue a notice to arrest communists and Central Government personnel?

(Answer) I did not know at the time. Is there any evidence of rescuing underground workers? (Answer) Only based on conscience, there is no evidence. Why did you protect the four major cultural relics? Is there any evidence? (Answer) 1. The Ancient Relics Exhibition Hall, 2. The Palace Museum, 3. The Beijing Library, 4.

<h3>UN General Assembly Passes All Agenda Items - Committees Begin Work - Elect Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons Respectively</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) New York, 24th Broadcast: Success Lake Dispatch: The Trusteeship Council met at 11:00 AM this morning. The meeting was chaired by Berendsen of New Zealand, and Shmygov of Belarus was elected as Vice-Chairperson. Dousinville of Haiti was elected as spokesperson. The Economic Committee was chaired by Santa Cruz, and Bertien of the Netherlands was elected as Vice-Chairperson. Henk of Czechoslovakia was elected as spokesperson.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 23rd Dispatch) The United Nations General Assembly has now completed its organizational phase after passing the agenda proposed by the Steering Committee today. From tomorrow onwards, the General Assembly will move to Success Lake and begin its actual work, dividing the 61 items on the agenda among the six committees and two ad hoc committees for substantive discussion. After a full day of careful discussion, today's meeting resolved to pass all the items on the provisional agenda. Among the items passed, except for the Greek and Italian peace treaty issues, all were passed smoothly without any debate. In addition, the General Assembly passed the proposal to establish a special committee to handle the Palestine issue with 29 votes to 11, with 6 abstentions. Before voting on the agenda items, the General Assembly first listened to a speech by UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie (see yesterday's dispatch). The special appeal of Lie was still ringing in their ears when Soviet Representative Vyshinsky and US Representative Austin engaged in a verbal battle over the legitimacy of including the Greek and Italian peace treaty issues on the General Assembly's agenda. Vyshinsky argued that resolving the issue of Korean independence was the responsibility of the major powers, not something the United Nations should discuss. When Vyshinsky blamed the United States for the deadlock in the Korean issue, US Representative Austin immediately stood up to refute him. Chinese Representative Jiang Tingfu, in supporting the US position, reiterated China's position on Korean independence (this position had been stated by our Representative Gu Weijun at the General Assembly). When voting on whether the Italian peace treaty issue should be included on the General Assembly's agenda, China abstained. Among the countries that voted against were Abyssinia and the Soviet bloc countries. Although the United States won an initial experimental vote on the above issue, it is still unclear whether this is a true victory for the United States in this diplomatic battle against the Soviet Union, as the discussions in the United Nations General Assembly have so far only been on procedural issues.</p>
<h3>Truman Calls Cabinet Meeting - Statement on Food Situation May Be Issued Today - Clayton and Others Summoned Home to Report</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) San Francisco, 24th Broadcast: President Truman convened a special cabinet meeting today to discuss what officials called "the general food situation." It is expected that the cabinet meeting will discuss the issue of Western Europe's request for assistance and its potential impact on domestic prices in the United States. According to the White House press secretary, President Truman's statement will not be issued tonight and may be issued tomorrow, as the President has scheduled a press conference for tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 23rd Dispatch) President Truman met with Agriculture Secretary Anderson again today to prepare the statement he will issue regarding the responsibility of the United States for the world food problem. Authoritative sources said that the content of the President's statement will include the following points: Pointing out that the shortfall in world grain supplies this year will reach four to five million tons, and the people of the world are threatened by famine. Calling for a halt to speculative waves in the Chicago grain market to prevent stimulating grain prices and prevent European countries lacking dollars from being hit again. Calling on farmers to stop feeding grain to livestock and urging people to voluntarily reduce meat consumption. Announcing a temporary reduction of 100 million bushels in exports to reduce the stimulation of the Chicago market. At the same time, stating that once the market stabilizes, the export quantity will be increased again. Suggesting that after Congress approves the appropriation, the export of surplus food with higher nutritional value and higher prices, such as dried fruits and sugar, should be used to compensate for the reduction in the export of grains. Related parties expect that the President will not demand that the government have the power to forcibly requisition grain, but many foreign officials believe that this is the only solution to cope with the world food shortage.</p>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch) Secretary of State Marshall, in order to intensify efforts to cope with the European crisis, telegraphed Undersecretary of State Clayton and Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas today to report on the details of the Paris Economic Conference.

The State Department's work of reviewing the plan will take at least a week before it can decide whether the United States agrees with its conclusions.</p>
<h3>UK Orders Ban on Anti-Semitic Movement - Jones Arrives in New York</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) London, 24th Broadcast: The British government, deeply concerned that the current anti-Semitic movement will create "an extremely bad situation," has ordered the police to prohibit people from making speeches attacking Jews in public places. As for speakers who do not attack Jews but only support fascist ideas, the British government will not interfere.

<h3>UN General Assembly Korean Observer - Criticizes Vyshinsky</h3>
<p>Demands Soviet Union Withdraw Troops from North Korea</p>
<p>(United Press, New York, 23rd Dispatch) UN General Assembly Korean Observer Yin Luyi issued a statement today on the speech by Soviet Representative Vyshinsky, saying, "In international history, there has been no speech by an important foreign minister that is so contradictory since Hitler. Mr. Vyshinsky strongly advocates that foreign troops should withdraw from the territory of non-enemy countries, so why does the Soviet Union not take the lead and withdraw its troops stationed in North Korea? Mr. Marshall is justified in placing the Korean issue on the agenda of the General Assembly. Only the power of world public opinion and the rational decisions of representatives of various countries can make Korea a free and democratic country, contributing to peace in Asia."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Detains 40,000 Koreans on Sakhalin Island</h3>
<p>(United Press, Seoul, 24th Dispatch) A Korean youth who used a pseudonym to leave Sakhalin Island arrived here today. It is said that 40,000 Koreans are still being detained on the island.

<h3>United States Has Abundant Resources - Sufficient to Meet European Needs - Investigative Committee Completes Report</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch) It was learned here on the 24th that the special committee established by President Truman in June will provide the President with an investigation report at the end of this week. The report shows that the United States, if it can make "some adjustments," actually has most of the resources needed by Europe under the Marshall Plan. The committee, chaired by Interior Secretary Krug, focused on the flexibility of the US economy to adapt to the severe requirements of the Second World War.</p>
<p>General Observation: The Marshall Plan is another round of experiments, which have not been successful in the past. The President established the committee to investigate US resources and their relationship to European reconstruction needs, and to prepare a balance sheet. The committee has completed the report after three months of intense work. In terms of US resources, the responsibilities required by the Marshall Plan can be successfully completed. However, the report warns that adjustments in the substitution and distribution of certain rare materials are urgently needed to meet European estimates. Authoritative sources said that the report pointed out that wheat, grains, coal, steel, nitrogen, fertilizers, and certain types of industrial equipment will be scarce in the next few years. Officials familiar with the report said that the report stated that without automatic or government-mandated allocations, it may not be possible to reach certain export levels. But it said, "If the necessary adjustments are made, the report has no discouraging aspects." The Krug report handed over the final decision-making power and recommendations on meeting European needs to another presidential committee chaired by Commerce Secretary Harriman.</p>
<h3>British and American Condemnation of Bulgarian Government for Execution of Petkov</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 23rd Dispatch) The US government declared today that world opinion believes that the Bulgarian government's execution of Petkov shows its unwillingness to respect the lowest principles of justice and the basic rights of mankind. The statement issued by the State Department pointed out that the timing and manner of Petkov's trial, as well as other repressive measures by the Bulgarian government, show that the Fatherland Front party government controlled by the Communist Party intends to eliminate all opposition forces and consolidate its totalitarian government.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 23rd Dispatch) Diplomatic circles here said that Britain believes that Petkov's execution is "far from European civilization." British Foreign Secretary Bevin consulted with his advisors on whether to lodge a formal protest with the Bulgarian government. It is reported that Bevin attaches great importance to this matter.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Marshall Plan Awaits - Britain Prepares for Self-Reliance - Plans to Develop Final Plan to Cope with Crisis</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch) Authoritative sources said that Britain's plan to overcome the economic crisis requires the production of export goods worth £1.7 billion in the next 15 months, and the government has decided not to reduce austerity measures until this goal is achieved. The British government expects to be able to make up for the £600 million trade deficit by the end of 1948.</p>
<p>The plan has five main points: Reduce imports, Reduce overseas spending, Increase exports, Consolidate resources in key industries, Increase agricultural production in Britain and its colonies. Although the total trade deficit of the UK is £600 million, the trade deficit with the dollar area is £800 million, which is because the UK has previously had a trade surplus with countries outside the dollar area. There are two ways to make up for the trade deficit: Reduce imports by about £200 million, Increase exports by £370 million by mid-next year, and increase exports by £570 million by the end of next year, increasing by 40% and 60% respectively compared to the 1938 level. This is only the goal of overcoming the current economic crisis. To restore prosperity, exports must be increased to 175% of pre-war levels, which will only be achieved by 1949. All of Britain's plans are based on the assumption that it will not receive aid under the Marshall Plan. To maintain the needs of the transition period, Britain will have to use its gold reserves or request funds from the International Monetary Fund to cover the expenses.</p>

<h3>Dollar Panic Increasingly Serious - France Appeals to US for Assistance - France Will Be Forced to Stop Buying US Goods</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch) According to reliable diplomatic sources, France has made a series of requests to the United States. If rejected, it will set back the Marshall Plan by six months. It is reported that the French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, informed the US that: France will stop buying goods in the United States from late October onwards, which is an inevitable consequence of the lack of dollars; currently, France is only buying fats, flour, and coal from the United States. Unless a way can be found to continue shipping the above items to France, French coal production will be reduced by more than 30%, as workers will not have enough food to eat.</p>
<h3>France Concerned About Situation in Germany</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Paris, 23rd Dispatch) The French Foreign Ministry said that the success of the 16-nation report on the Marshall Plan depends on whether West Germany is included in the European economy and what the US tariff policy is. "Unless the US doors must be open to European goods, European economic recovery will be hopeless." A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry also said that an agreement on the entire economic organization of West Germany must be reached by the great powers before the end of this year, otherwise the Marshall Plan will be seriously hit.</p>
<h3>International Bank Has No Funds to Aid Europe</h3>
<p>Plans to Resell Bonds to the United States</p>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Vice President Garner announced today that the four-year plan for the economic recovery of the sixteen Western European countries requires a total of US$22.4 billion. Although it is stipulated that under the Marshall Plan, the US government will provide US$19.3 billion in funding, and the World Bank will lend US$3.1 billion, the bank currently only has about US$500 million available for lending. To remedy the situation, the only option is to resell bonds to US investors. Therefore, in fact, all the costs required for European recovery must come from US investors. However, the bank does not want to issue bonds exclusively for Europe.</p>
<h3>Italian Textile Workers Stage General Strike</h3>
<p>Government Suffers Setback in Parliament</p>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) London, 24th Broadcast: All technical personnel in the Italian textile industry are staging a general strike.

<p>(Associated Press, Rome, 23rd Dispatch) The Gasperi government's proposal to amend the constitution in parliament was met with strong opposition from the left, and ultimately suffered a setback by 57 votes.

<h3>Katayama Cabinet is Incompetent - Yoshida Shigeru's Jibe</h3>
<p>(New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch) With the opening of the Diet imminent, the Katayama cabinet will encounter unprecedented difficulties due to the fierce attacks of the party and opposition parties on the Economic Power Concentration Exclusion Act and the Coal National Control Act. In particular, Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party and former Prime Minister, has spared no effort in criticizing the government. In a speech in Hokkaido, Yoshida openly called the Katayama cabinet "a family where dogs and monkeys live together." Yoshida believes that only a single-party and pure cabinet can cope with the peace conference and overcome the most difficult journey in history, but the Socialist Party can never shoulder this mission.</p>
<h3>Hiranuma Kiichirō on Trial</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Dispatch) The military tribunal conducted a defense for the case of former Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichirō today.

<h3>Senators Question the Five Bureaus; Education Becomes the Target of Public Criticism; Four Meetings Held Today to Discuss Proposals</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) Yesterday morning, the Social Affairs, Public Works, Education, Finance, and Police Committees of the Municipal Senate held subcommittee meetings to review proposals. In the afternoon, the fourth plenary session of the Senate held its third meeting. Senators enthusiastically questioned the administration of public utilities, education, sanitation, public works, and land administration for two and a half hours. Those who could not raise their questions orally submitted them in writing, and then Bureau Chief Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau, Bureau Chief Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, and Bureau Chief Zhao Zeng of the Public Utilities Bureau answered the questions one after another. The replies from the heads of the Sanitation and Education Bureaus were postponed to this afternoon due to the late hour.</p>
<p>Senators had especially numerous questions for the Education Bureau yesterday. Pang Jingzhou reported a fact, saying that some private schools still charged fees exceeding the standards. The Education Bureau ordered each school to submit a budget to the Education Bureau for review to show financial transparency, but the school authorities actually distributed forms with set items to each parent to solicit their consent and then have them stamped and returned. Some parents expressed dissatisfaction and intended to criticize, but their children begged their parents, saying, "If you don't stamp your consent, I will lose points at school." So the parents stamped their consent vaguely. This situation is not only harmful to parents but also greatly affects the education of children, making them learn to deceive and break the law from a young age, which is truly heartbreaking. Does the Education Bureau pay attention to this?</p>
<p>Zhou Lianze said that the Municipal Normal School on Lao Bazi Road falsely reported the number of students and is suspected of fraud and corruption. Why doesn't the Education Bureau order an investigation? Zhang Zhihan and Xie Dahuang said that the attached middle school of the Municipal Normal School destroyed the building of Wuben Girls' Middle School, causing losses of more than 100 million yuan. A formal educational institution has such savage behavior and should be severely punished. Lu Shidao said: The Yangshupu district donated 600 to 700 million for school celebrations for the birthday, and now four schools have been established, all in the alleys. Two of the schools were reorganized from private schools. This situation violates the original purpose of the birthday celebration. Zhong Yuliang asked why elementary schools cannot expel bad students? And why can't incompetent teachers be transferred? Zhao Yangxiong loudly called for the elimination of illiteracy to reduce various social problems.</p>
<p>Jiang Jizhou said: Many elementary schools are located in alleys, and classes are held in the early morning or evening, which is detrimental to the health of students. Furthermore, they wander around at home or on the streets during the day. How can we be optimistic about such education? Also, is the selection of principals fair and reasonable?</p>
<p>What is the Use of Teachers' Appreciation Money?</p>
<p>Chen asked: What was the use of the 100 million yuan teachers' appreciation fund collected by the municipal schools in the first half of last year? Also, seeing that only half of the refresher course fees have been refunded to middle schools, and elementary schools have not yet been refunded, is it planned to continue the refund? Jiang Hao asked for the establishment of a municipal school in the Old Zhabei district. Hou asked for the establishment of a school in the new district. said that the tuition fees of the former municipal schools were even higher than those of private schools due to too many items. Some students in the Pudong municipal schools were abandoned outside the school because they could not pay the fees. The authorities should find a way to solve this.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sanitation Bureau, Hou said that the corpses of Tongren and Fuyuantang were placed on the roadside, affecting sanitation. Please order an immediate investigation and ban. Zhang Zhongyuan hopes that municipal hospitals will admit patients first and then ask for fees. Fan Shouyuan asked to stop outsiders from using doctors' names to make advertisements and deceive people of money. Also, please ask the Sanitation Bureau to find a way to clean up the garbage, feces, and sewage on the roads.</p>
<h3>A Tense Scene: Uneven Gas Distribution for Cars; Efforts to Strive for Quota Rationing</h3>
<p>Questions Regarding Public Utilities: Senators expressed dissatisfaction with the poor management of gasoline distribution for cars. Fei Shusheng especially advocated quota rationing, which caused a tense scene. Fei complained that it is often difficult to get gas for cars, and gas stations do not deliver gas on time. As a result, scalpers take the opportunity to hoard. Once he personally saw a truck record 4,000 or 50 gallons of gasoline added every day, but it is not easy to get gallons for those who go to add gas with a license according to the regulations. If there are cards and licenses, why...</p>
<p>Bureau Chief Zhao explained: There are many difficult problems. The Public Utilities Bureau has issued about 16,000 licenses, but there are only 49 gas stations and few oil tankers. Everyone goes to add gas, which creates a situation that cannot be handled. In fact, there is no shortage of oil. He asked the Senate to advise citizens not to panic. However, there are indeed cases of fraud at gas stations. After investigation, some gas stations have been closed. He will also ask the oil company to replace the owners of the gas stations. The bureau is currently trying to improve the method. It has notified the oil company that large trucks can only add a maximum of 15 gallons per day and cars 5 gallons per day in the future. Fei was dissatisfied with the Director's reply and insisted that the monthly consumption of trucks and cars should be stipulated separately according to their needs to prevent hoarding. Director Zhao immediately stated that the problem of adding gas is complicated and is willing to discuss the opinions with Senator Fei in detail and submit them to the Economic Inspection Committee for reporting. Fei insisted on his suggestion and asked the Bureau Chief to accept it. Later, Deputy Speaker Xu expressed his opinion and asked the Bureau Chief to submit Senator Fei's suggestion to the Economic Inspection Committee for discussion. This case then .</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Price Increase; Why Does the Deposit Also Increase?</h3>
<p>Fei also asked: Public utilities prices have increased, why has the deposit also increased? Director Zhao replied: The deposits are now called security deposits. The price increase is stipulated by the central government, but in order to reduce the burden on citizens, the municipal government specially invited the authorities of various companies to hold a meeting to set a flexible method, stipulating that at most two adjustments can be made within one year. If there are more, this bureau can handle it. Fei asked the director to submit a request to the central government on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai to abolish the security deposit system. Director Zhao immediately stated that he hoped that the Senate would make a formal motion so that the Public Utilities Bureau could definitely convey it.</p>
<h3>Why is He Still Employing Japanese Staff?</h3>
<p>Chen Boliang also questioned: Why is the Public Utilities Bureau's Transportation Company still employing Japanese technicians? What is the basis for the base salary of 260 yuan? How can Song Yunhui, the legal advisor of the Exchange Company, also serve as a committee member and deputy director of the preparation? What experience does Song have? Can a lawyer work as a public official? What is the basis for his base salary of 430 yuan and subsidies? What is the experience of the accounting director? The original base salary was set at 210 yuan, why should it be given 400 yuan? Why are all the expenses of Director Zhang Ming's housing paid for by the government?</p>
<h3>Because of a Lack of "Talent"</h3>
<p>Director Zhao immediately replied one by one: There are currently two Japanese technicians, who have been approved by the Ministry of Communications. The two are now on the electric tram outside Jianjiao because we lack technical talents. The government employs them with a broad mind, just like the Soviet Union employed Germans. The legal advisor is needed, and he is helping with the preparation. His actual title is still advisor, and his subsidies are public funds. The base salary of the accounting director was originally approved by the municipal government at 280 yuan. Because of his high ability, the municipal government was asked to increase it to 400 yuan. The house where Director Zhang lives is a company dormitory, and all the equipment in the dormitory should be provided by the government.</p>

<h3>Why are there so many holes in the road? Why are they not repaired diligently? Why is the Pudong Avenue not repaired? Is the asphalt removed being utilized?</h3>
<p>Regarding questions related to the Public Works Bureau, most people asked why there are so many holes in the road? Why not add more repairs? Bureau Chief Zhao Zukang replied that the price of road repair materials has skyrocketed, and funds are limited, so only the main roads can be repaired first. Chen Peide and Zhang Zhihan both asked why the Pudong Avenue has not been repaired so far.</p>
<p>Answer: It is planned to repair the 17-kilometer section from the Shangnan Railway to Donggou first.

<h3>The Silverware Industry Association's General Assembly; Business Resumption Still Pending</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) Since the authorities stipulated the methods for the silverware industry to resume business, the Silverware Industry Association convened a general meeting of all members in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to discuss various issues related to the resumption of business, and invited Gu Bingyuan, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to attend the meeting to explain seven points that should be observed when purchasing and selling gold ornaments: The price of gold ornaments sold should be based on the gold price listed by the Central Bank, plus 40% for operating expenses and 20% for legal profits, and an additional labor cost may be added, but all prices are not allowed to be listed. The purchase price of gold ornaments may be appropriately subsidized for their labor costs depending on the work, but it must not be arbitrarily increased. Purchases are limited to gold ornaments, and the purchase of gold bars or gold ornaments is absolutely prohibited. Sales are also limited to gold ornaments, and it is absolutely forbidden to sell gold ornaments in melted bars. Each piece of gold ornament sold must not exceed two market taels. Purchases and sales of gold ornaments should be recorded separately on the books and invoices, and the expenses should be clearly stated one by one for verification. If the market fluctuates and the price must be revised, the association should write to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. All directors and supervisors of the silverware industry should set an example, supervise their members, and supervise each other. If there is any violation of the above matters, they should be responsible for reporting it. Then, they jointly discussed methods to prohibit black market trading. As for the issue of resuming business, because the actual difficulties in operation still need to be discussed with the authorities, and the order from the authorities allowing the resumption of business has not yet arrived, the resumption period may still be pending.</p>
<p>Payment Methods</p>
<p>Still Pending Approval</p>

<h3>The China Trust Bureau's Handling of the Large Yarn Factory Property on Yulin Road; Detailed Account</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) Since the Committee of Resident Members of the Senate raised the issue of investigating the China Trust Bureau's sale of enemy property at a low price, this reporter recently learned the details of the matter from relevant parties as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the property on Yulin Road, the land was originally purchased by the owner, Chen Rentao, from the Dede Hall, and it was agreed that the lease term would be until the end of the 42nd year of the Republic of China. Upon expiration, the house would belong to the landowner. On January 22nd of the 30th year of the Republic of China, a large silver company transferred the surface rights to the Gonghuo Yarn Factory, but the factory was unable to recover the house for use as a workshop and still lived in the original tenants. After the victory, the original situation was maintained. In fact, it was completely occupied by the Shanghai Fish Market and other civilians, and there were no vacant houses. After the Textile Management Committee took over, it sent an official letter to the China Trust Bureau, stating that it was impossible for the households to move out immediately, but it was also inconvenient to rent the houses by household if the established fact was recognized. At that time, the landowner, Chen Rentao, used funds to repurchase the remaining seven years of surface rights stipulated in the contract. After review by the former Enemy Property Processing Bureau, since the term of the above-mentioned surface rights was only more than seven years, the current houses could not be used by Zhongfang, and the small amount of rent could not be In addition, the entire house structure was not suitable for use as a factory, and it was one mile away from the Gongda Yarn Factory, so there was no need to merge and handle it with Gongda. Therefore, the landowner was allowed to pay the price at once to repurchase the surface rights, but since all the houses were occupied, what the original owner repurchased was only the right to income and not the right to use. The price to be paid was the rent for the remaining seven years, deducting the expenses to be borne by the owner. The calculation of the rent was based on a field survey. The monthly rent for each house in July of the 34th year of the Republic of China was 3,000 yuan in puppet currency. Generally speaking, the rent this year is about four times that of the 34th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, the monthly rent for each house in Yulinli should be 12,000 yuan, which is 144,000 yuan per year. The total rent for 128 houses is 18,432,000 yuan. After deducting 25% for management expenses, the owner's net profit is 13,824,000 yuan per year. If the seven-year rent is paid at once, calculated at an annual interest rate of 7%, it should be 74,456,064 yuan. At an annual interest rate of 7%, which is 20 times lower than the black market, the interest deducted by the cleaning office is obviously suppressed. Moreover, according to the gold price in the 34th year of the Republic of China, each ten taels was converted into 6.2 million yuan in puppet currency at that time. The highest black market gold price after the victory was far above this number, which is enough to prove that the above-mentioned rent was calculated at four times the number of puppet currency in July of the 34th year of the Republic of China, which was obviously not underestimated. Changshi ordered the landowner to settle the case by paying the price at once, which was beneficial to the national treasury. In addition, the decision on this number was still during the tenure of Director Liu Gongyun, and was made by the current Director Wu Rencang</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of general enemy and puppet properties, enemy and puppet real estate were originally received by the original receiving agencies, such as the Headquarters of the Third Front Army, the Military Statistics Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee, and other receiving agencies that first came to Shanghai, and then transferred them to the China Trust Bureau. There were people living in the houses when they were transferred, and it is still difficult to vacate them, making sales and meeting the needs of government agencies difficult. Residents pay usage fees on a monthly basis, and there are also cases where agencies and troops refuse to pay. The bureau has reported these situations for approval. All information on residents and processing registers was submitted to the supervisory committee that came to Shanghai in early May.</p>
<p>Regarding the secret collection of transfer fees, the bureau suggested in another document submitted to the supervisory committee that the Executive Yuan should consider first vacating the occupants to facilitate bidding. If this can be done, the truth can be revealed through the complaints of those who paid to transfer the property.</p>
<p>Regarding the accelerated handling of property inheritance claims, the China Trust Bureau stated that there are many disputes over illegal properties, which are ruled by the court. After the case is settled, it can be handled quickly or returned to the owner.</p>
<h3>Gold and Paper Money Black Market Still Rampant; Two More Agencies Raided Yesterday; Evidence Seized from Guotai Silver Firm and Dechang Money Shop; Economic Section Chief Says Comprehensive Crackdown Will Occur Shortly</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The Economic Section of the Police Bureau recently learned that Guotai Silver Firm at 479 Sichuan Middle Road in this city, although seemingly closed on the surface, is actually the nerve center of the city's gold and paper money black market. It moves hundreds of taels of gold and thousands of US dollars in and out every day. In order to avoid attracting attention, it uses 329 Yongyuanli, Tianjin Road, Jiangxi Road as the transaction agency for gold and paper money transactions after they are completed. Thus, without making a sound, Section Chief Xu dispatched team leader Chen Cheng, along with officers Si Yunkui, Liang Heting, Yang Guocheng and others to Jiangxi Road for investigation at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. As a result, six large gold bars and more than fifty small bars were seized, totaling 112 taels, eight maces and nine fen, as well as 22 and a half gold pounds, and many evidences such as account books and checkbooks were seized, and Si Rongxin, the stock accountant of Bian Tai Bank, and Sun Yuxin, an employee, and three others were arrested at the scene. However, Manager Wang Kewen and Shen Boping had already heard the news and fled beforehand. After the case was brought to the bureau for interrogation yesterday, in addition to temporarily releasing the three suspects on bail, the summons was also issued to the manager of the firm. As for the seized gold, it will be handed over to the Central Bank for safekeeping pending disposal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the section also raided Dechang Money Shop at 268 Daming Road for the crime of buying and selling US dollars. 116 US dollars and 292 US gold coins of various sizes were seized at the scene. The person in charge of the shop, Lü Zisheng, was brought to the bureau for interrogation. According to Xu Youzuo, the chief of the Economic Section, the gold and paper money black market has been rampant recently, and the section has great confidence in completely eradicating it in the short term.</p>

<p>(Our Newspaper) At around 11:00 AM on the 23rd, two young women, Li Xiazhen and Wang Baoji, were riding in a rickshaw in Zhangjiangzha, Pudong, when a bandit pulled out a box cannon while passing Qiujiazhai in Tangqiao and took away four gold rings and one gold bracelet.

<h3>Seven Years of Heartbreak Leads to Reunion and Estrangement: A Lonely Female Teacher Ends Her Life in a Lake</h3>
<p>(This Newspaper) Prosecutor Lu Zhennan of the District Prosecutor's Office went to the morgue on Changde Road yesterday to examine the body of a woman who committed suicide. It is reported that her name was Zhang Xin'en, also known as Fengying, 28 years old, a former teacher who was currently unemployed. She was of a lonely background and resided at the home of a friend surnamed Liu at No. 109, Dongzhao Lane, Sigaota Road. Seven years ago, Zhang was in love with a young engineer named Liang Mingke, and they were very close. Later, they separated due to the outbreak of war. After the victory, Liang and Zhang reunited in Shanghai, but Liang already had a wife and children. Although they still associated from time to time, Zhang pursued Liang intensely. At this time, Liang had already expressed his coldness. On Sunday, the 21st of this month, Zhang waited all day for Liang to go out, but he never arrived. Zhang, being unemployed and impoverished, and also suffering from Liang's indifference, became weary of life. On the night before last, around 9 pm, wearing a red floral print short shirt and pants, she secretly entered Zhongzheng Park and committed suicide by throwing herself into the lake. She was discovered and rescued by gardener Tang Jinming, who reported to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, which sent her to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for emergency treatment.

After examination by the prosecutor, it was determined that she had drowned. Since Zhang had no family, the Zhabei Evangelistic Society took her body for burial.</p>
<h3>Electrical Workers Obey Orders and Resume Work</h3>
<p>Director Wu Hopes that Well-Behaved Workers Will Recognize the Communist Bandit Conspiracy and Not Be Deceived</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) After receiving a limited order from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon, all employees of the Shanghai Electric Power Company immediately resumed work. At 3 pm, all factory and company employees at Yangpu, Buren Road, and other locations had resumed work.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, all employees of the company still went to the factory. Except for the power generation department, which continued to work as usual, the remaining employees did not work, resulting in a state of intentional slow-down. The Social Affairs Bureau specifically ordered the Electric Power Company Industrial Union to immediately resume work, otherwise, the company authorities would be allowed to unconditionally dismiss non-working workers and dissolve the industrial union. After the order was delivered, all employees fully resumed work. According to Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Affairs Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the six people arrested from the Electric Power Company, including Wu Kewen, were arrested by the government for having solid evidence of reactionary activities. They cannot be compared to other situations, and they cannot arbitrarily strike or petition. Moreover, the decision to slow down work today (i.e., yesterday) was made by the board of directors during a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau on the evening of the 23rd. Therefore, it is clear that a small number of people are manipulating and inciting. During this period of general mobilization, incitement to slow down work or strike will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, made a statement yesterday regarding the arrest by the police of communist bandits, including Zhang Zhongzhi and Wu Kewen, within the Electric Power Company Union at the Futong Printing House. He said: Last January, when I took office, the workers of the Electric Power Company were in the midst of a complete work slowdown. On February 12, the bureau convened labor and management to sign a settlement record, which included a clause stating that "the union promises to provide a written guarantee to the Social Affairs Bureau and the company that if there are any labor-management disputes in the future, there will be no work slowdowns or strikes during the mediation or arbitration period, in accordance with the law." However, labor unrest has occurred repeatedly over the past year, and work slowdowns have occurred at every turn, making it clear that they have not complied with the agreement. I have always respected labor and have repeatedly shown tolerance and made every effort to mediate when the workers of the company have broken their promises. It was only after this incident was discovered by the police that I realized that the labor unrest in the factory was actually a planned act of sabotage by a small number of communist bandits who were holding the union hostage. It is clear that the communist bandits in Shanghai want to bankrupt industry, cause workers to lose their jobs, create social unrest, and plunge the city into chaos, and the consequences will be dire. The government will not condone such communist bandits who endanger the survival of society and the lives of the people, and will take strict measures. I believe that the majority of laborers and workers of the Electric Power Company are law-abiding and well-behaved workers who have been manipulated and incited by a small number of conspirators, causing them to fall into their trap. Now that the facts are clear, I sincerely hope that all workers will recognize the sinister schemes of the communist bandits and not be deceived or blindly follow them, leading to their own loss and suffering.</p>
<p>Announcement from Commander Xuan</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, met with reporters yesterday afternoon and stated: The conspiracy of communist bandit special agents to carry out sabotage of the Shanghai Electric Power Company has been crushed.

<h3>Zhang Qun Talks About the Three Treasures in the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Shenyang Dispatch from this Newspaper, 21st) Zhang Qun has flown here. He has shown a special affection for the Northeast. During his student days, he saw a thesis by Dr. Bianchuan at the home of Mr. Baihui, a member of the Japanese Socialist Party, entitled "Japan's Rights in Manchuria," and immediately felt concerned about the safety of the Northeast. He said to the citizens of Shenyang: "We have three treasures in the Northeast: ginseng, sable fur, and Ula grass. Where are these three treasures now?"</p>
<p>"A nation also has three treasures: land, people, and sovereignty. Now, the land and people have not been fully recovered, and sovereignty is not complete. What treasures are still in our embrace?" He raised a very profound question: The central government has decided to resolutely implement the national policy of industrializing the Northeast. Within three days, he is willing to see more, listen more, speak more, and thoroughly understand the real environment of the Northeast with the people of the Northeast. Mr. Zhang claimed to be a bridge between the central and local governments. He represents the Central Committee's complete trust in Director Chen Cheng and is completely connected to the concerns and affection of the people of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang spoke to reporters with a sincere and frank attitude, without reservation, like an old friend of the reporters. He could not hide his enthusiasm for the Northeast. He said: "I first came to the Northeast in 1907 to pass through Japan to redeem books. I came to the Northeast for the second time in 1929 to ask Zhang Xueliang to cooperate with the central government. This is now the third time I have come to the Northeast. I originally wanted to arrive on September 18, but I was delayed by attending a central meeting." The "September 18th Incident" made him</p>
<p>Interested in historical memories</p>
<p>And also felt heavy hearted! He said: "The September 18th Incident changed the history of China and triggered World War II. History proves that the safety of the Northeast is not only related to the survival of the country but also related to world security. The national policy of recovering the Northeast, building the Northeast, and guaranteeing national independence and freedom will never change." He put forward two famous quotes from ancient Chinese political philosophy: "The people are the foundation of the nation, and when the foundation is strong, the nation is stable," and urged the people of the Northeast to encourage the people of the Northeast with the four words "Advocate Law and Seek Truth," to be new people, to practice new life, to create a new atmosphere, and to shoulder new missions.</p>
<p>At a time when the situation in the Northeast is transitioning from an old stage to a new stage, Zhang Qun's arrival in the Northeast can be said to be a major event. He has brought the people of the Northeast</p>
<p>Enough hope and comfort.</p>
<p>He is probably the first Premier of the Republic of China to come to the Northeast. Chen Cheng, concurrently in charge of the Northeast military and political affairs, only saw the swift and decisive rectification movement, and the issue of canceling the special status of the Northeast is still being planned behind the scenes. How to proceed, the central government maintains caution. This time, Zhang Qun first expressed his opinion on the Northeast currency system: The central government has not considered the issue of reforming the Northeast currency system because it was originally issued to stabilize the Northeast economy. Today, if we want to consider changing it, we must first consider this issue. Zhang's opinion on this issue is the best test for canceling the special status of the Northeast.

<h3>Haining Merchants and Residents Build Tidal Viewing Sheds</h3>
<p>(Haining Dispatch from this Newspaper, 22nd) The "Haining Tide" has a long history. Once the autumn flood arrives, the "Orphan Soul Tide" and the "Sea King Tide" will arrive together. According to legend, the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month is the "Tide's Birthday." When the tide comes, it is like a stack, like a chain, with a rumbling sound that never stops. The momentum is like ten thousand horses galloping, shaking the earth and overturning the sky, collapsing mountains and overturning the sea, rushing mightily, jumping beads and surging froth, it is an amazing spectacle. The tide season this year has passed, but because the collapse of the Nansha River (located across the river from the Haining Dike) has intensified, the sea sand has poured into the outside of the Haining Dike. Over time, the beach has extended far overseas by ten miles. During the Orphan Soul Tide (the middle of the seventh lunar month), there is no tide to watch at the Haining Dike. The water only rises a few feet outside the beach. Recently, salt farmers have begun to build thatched huts on the beach. The place where the angry waves used to crash is now becoming a large-scale performance venue.</p>
<p>In the area of ​​Babu (near Chenwengang), the tide is still fierce. After the autumn flood began, the seawall was eroded by the waves and collapsed again, a few hundred steps away from Qibu City and the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. Farmers who planted sandy land have dismantled their houses and moved their belongings one after another. The Seawall Engineering Bureau has now tendered for the construction of cement-mixed steel concrete seawalls in the area, and temporary merchants have started building tidal-viewing sheds. Although the tide does not have its former grandeur when it comes, it is expected that the grand occasion will not be weaker than the Haining Dike at that time.</p>
<h3>Nansha Autumn Tide Can Be Passed Safely</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou Dispatch from this Newspaper, 24th) The Nansha River collapse has formed a peninsula at Toupeng. After a week of active rescue work by the Engineering Office of the Dike Engineering Bureau, stone revetments loaded with wooden cages have been very effective. The autumn tide may be passed safely. After a long-term consolidation and repair for three or four months this winter, the spring tide next year can be prepared for without worry.</p>

<h3>Details of the Capture of a Cheng County Self-Defense Team Member for Colluding with Bandits by the Military Police</h3>
<p>(Jiangyin Dispatch from this Newspaper, 23rd) Siyang Bridge, Matown, which is under the jurisdiction of the county, is close to Toushan, Xijing. The Ninth Company of the Third Battalion of the Sixteenth Regiment of the Military Police is stationed there to prevent bandits. At about 10 am on the 20th, Company Commander Xu Shaohua sent six plainclothes personnel to the Beizhu Town Self-Defense Team to arrest team member Wu Sanbao on suspicion of colluding with bandits. Because no prior notice had been given and there were no official documents when they went to arrest him, they were stopped by the self-defense team members. After the six people returned to the company, more than twenty military police came and confiscated one Carl Ping gun, one Type 38 machine gun, and eleven rifles from the team. Town Mayor Xi Yutang, Instructor Liu Peng, and Wu Sanbao and other seven people were arrested. At noon, after receiving the report, County Magistrate Xu immediately spoke on the phone with Xu, the Commander of Xici Bridge, asking about the cause and effect, and put forward three points: If Wu Sanbao has indeed committed a crime, the military police can take him away for investigation, and the county government should be informed by letter of Wu Sanbao's crime and the interrogation situation. All the confiscated guns from the self-defense team should be returned. If they must be taken away, a receipt should be given. If the town mayor and instructor of Beizhu are suspected of a crime, please notify the county government with official documents to take them into custody, and temporarily release them. Xu, the Commander, released the town mayor in the evening, and the confiscated guns have not yet been returned, but a receipt was given. At midnight, Mayor Xi rushed to the county government to report the incident to County Magistrate Xu, and the defense of Beizhu was temporarily taken over by the Qingyang Police Bureau. County Magistrate Xu also reported to the Wuxi Headquarters, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate the true situation and await handling.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, after the Wuxi Headquarters sent Staff Officer Chen and Zhang, Section Chief of the County Government, to investigate the case, both parties established a mediation record. Instructor Liu and others have been released. Wu Sanbao was not released because he was suspected of being a bandit. The weapons have been submitted to the superiors. They will be returned after Staff Officer Chen's negotiations. As for the issue of responsibility, it will be reported to the competent officer for review and handling.</p>

<h3>Fourteen Deaths in Xi'an Township, Qingpu County: Wanted Criminal Xue Chengde Attempts to Escape by Crossing a River: Dies After Being Rescued</h3>
<p>The 14 deaths in Xi'an County, which shocked Quanzhen during the Chongqing siege, were caused by the township chief Wu Shixian and the village chief Yu Kaosheng.

<h3>High Rice Prices and Low Salt Prices: Salt Farmers Reluctant to Hand Over Salt: Salt Administration Adopts New Measures</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou Dispatch from this Newspaper, 23rd) The issue of salt prices in the Yuyao Salt Field was previously decided by the Ministry of Social Affairs to be based on the principle of one dan of rice per thousand stones of salt, according to the current negotiated price. However, since August, the Salt Field Administration has gone back on its word and restored the assessed price system, which is below the standard, resulting in salt farmers being reluctant to hand over salt. Recently, the price of rice has been rising daily, and the price of salt has been low at 28,000 yuan, and payments are in arrears, resulting in even less salt being handed over. The Salt Administration has therefore taken emergency new measures to force the handover of salt, and the salt farmers who were arrested have not yet been released.</p>
<p>(Yuyao Dispatch from this Newspaper, 22nd) The issue of salt prices in the Yuyao Anjiao Salt Field has not been resolved reasonably. It is learned that after salt farmer Yao Rensheng was detained, thousands of salt farmers from the eastern and western districts gathered at Wan Song An in Anjiao from yesterday morning to evening to discuss countermeasures and sent more than ten representatives to the field administration to demand the release of the arrested salt farmers, but without result. The situation is still at a stalemate.</p>

<h3>National Textile Industry Production Conference Opens Today; Vice Minister Liu Briefs Reporters on the Conference's Mission Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Reported by our newspaper) The National Textile Industry Production Conference is scheduled to open at 9:00 AM this morning at the City Chamber of Commerce. The conference will last for three days and will be chaired by Chen Qitian. As of yesterday, more than sixty proposals had been received, mainly focusing on production and reconstruction. The Ministry of Economic Affairs also has a proposal for a five-year plan to develop the textile industry. The conference schedule is as follows: The opening ceremony will be held in the morning, with addresses. In the afternoon, the conference will feature reports from relevant agencies such as the Central Bank, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Textile Adjustment Committee, and the Export Control Committee, as well as representatives from the Textile Construction Company and private factories. Group review meetings will be held on the second day in both the morning and afternoon. The conference will continue on the third day with a general meeting to pass proposals before closing.</p>
<p>(Another report) The Preparatory Committee for the Textile Production Conference hosted a press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Liu Siying, the committee's chairman. He stated that the development of national industry must start with the textile industry, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs attaches great importance to this, which is why this production conference is being held. It will bring together leaders from industry, commerce, and finance to synthesize opinions from all sides and create a plan for implementation. China's textile industry has a history of sixty years and has achieved remarkable results. If it can be expanded and developed, it can not only solve the clothing problem but also raise living standards and create full employment. According to the industrial plan and the chairman's instructions, China should have 12 million spindles and 300,000 looms. However, China currently has only 4 million spindles (3.5 million in operation) and 68,000 looms. It cannot be self-sufficient, let alone export. It is hoped that this conference will gather opinions from all parties on improving production technology, cultivating talent, reducing costs, improving product quality, and coordinating labor and management, so that state-owned and private factories can closely cooperate and work together. He then discussed the work of the Textile Adjustment Committee, stating that its goals are twofold: one is to concentrate yarn and cloth resources to stabilize prices, and the other is to strive for fair allocation of cotton yarn, with distribution prices referring to cost and market conditions, and to strive for reasonable and flexible pricing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a buying spree was strongly revived for Chinese stocks. Initially, there was some panic, and there was a prolonged sluggishness. After 11:20 AM, stimulated by the Hong Kong exchange rate and the reduction of margin requirements, buying pressure arose, and short sellers wavered. Stock No. 224 turned bullish, and at the same time, made advances towards Xinyi. Therefore, the price increases were immediately astounding, and blue-chip stocks sharply increased.</p>
<p>Morning Session</p>
<p>Opening in the morning, all stocks rose due to the influence of the high off-exchange prices of the previous evening. Everyone was somewhat wary. Cantonese merchants were particularly eager to sell, and many unloaded their holdings. Deyong Yarn and spot Deyong Yarn immediately declined after opening. After 10:30 AM, off-exchange interest rates opened high at 2 jiao 1 fen and 2 jiao 5.5 fen, and rumors of traditional cloth production caused the price to fall to 239 yuan for immediate delivery and 240 yuan for deferred delivery. Spot Deyong Yarn and deferred Deyong Yarn were bought at lower prices, rising back to 242 yuan and 244 yuan, respectively. After 11:15 AM, bulls were unable to support the price, and it was forced down again to a low of 238 yuan for immediate delivery and 240 yuan for deferred delivery.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, within ten minutes, the spread with Hong Kong greatly narrowed, and there was also talk that margin requirements would be reduced to 30% collateral and 20% cash. Buying was strong, and in addition to short covering, there was also much buying from speculators. All stocks sharply rose. Near the close, spot Deyong Yarn rose to a high of 268 yuan, and deferred Deyong Yarn to 270 yuan. After the close, the asking price was confused. As a result, compared to the previous close for spot stocks, Xinyi rose by 10%, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinguang, China France, Rongfeng, and Wuhe rose by 5%, Jingfu, Neiyi, Huafeng, China Silk, and Commercial Press slightly increased, Xinhua and Huaxin fell by 5%, and Qinxing Cement, Match, and Zhabei Conscription decreased. For deferred stocks, Jingfu slightly increased, and Yong Yarn, Meiya, Huazhou, and Qinxing rose by 5%, while Xinyi rose by 10%.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session</p>
<p>Evening newspapers reported that margin requirements would be reduced to 30%, which improved market sentiment. Spot stocks opened high, with Yong Yarn rising to 275 yuan. Due to heavy buying, the price of Xinyi rose to the limit. However, Cantonese merchants and those who had profited frequently sold, lowering the price to 269 yuan. Later, it rose again to 274 yuan, and those who profited sold off their holdings. Although there was support from the state-owned banks and Stock No. 224, Yong Yarn was forced down to close at 265 yuan. The remaining stocks also retreated.</p>
<p>As a result, compared to the morning close for spot stocks, Yong Yarn, Hengfeng, and Zhabei Cement slightly decreased, Xinyi rallied after a sharp rise and closed higher, with Meiya, Lianyi, and Commercial Press experiencing small gains, Huafeng, Zhongfang, Match, and Huaxin rising by 5%, Qinxing, Xinhua, and Jinglun rising by about 15%, China France remaining flat, and Rongzheng falling by 5%. For deferred stocks, there was only trading in the first half of the day, and trading was suspended in the afternoon. The situation for various old stocks off-exchange was stable.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Sluggish; Foreign Stocks Slightly Recover</h3>
<p>Government bonds were even weaker yesterday, with a turnover of only 2 million. The process was extremely sluggish. Unified Class C agricultural bonds opened at 2,200 yuan, fell to a low of 11,900 yuan, and closed around 12,700 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Classes A and B remained flat, Unified Class C rose by 600 yuan, Class D rose by 100 yuan, and Unified Class E fell by 210 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were slightly higher after being popular yesterday. After the securities firms intervened, the market rapidly advanced. Banks, trading firms, and Xiangchang merchants all bought. It was rumored that the Hong Kong Telegraph spread was greatly reduced, but Reuters still reported 10.02 yuan. Yisha Nong opened at 102,000 yuan and rose from 101,500 yuan to 112,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell back to close at 107,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha rose slightly less than 5%, Xiangtai remained flat, Steel Industry and Telephone slightly decreased, and the remaining stocks slightly increased.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Surge and Retreat Quickly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 13,500 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. In the early market, japonica and indica rice prices uniformly rose by over 20,000 yuan. However, as supplies poured in, merchants became less enthusiastic, and the market situation quickly reversed, resulting in a rapid surge and retreat. Superior-quality rice rose by 10,000 yuan, while medium- and lower-quality rice remained flat. There were few new arrivals of Baiyuan rice.</p>
<p>Flour allocation prices remained the same, and market sales were sluggish. Foreign flour sharply increased by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while unified and factory flour rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bran was slightly active due to out-of-town merchants, and rural sales also inquired, with demand exceeding supply. The market rose rapidly, continuing its frenzy by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.

Green tea varieties still saw interest, but lacked large-scale transactions. The trend, due to limited inventory, was for sellers to ask for high prices, maintaining stability. According to industry insiders, local exporters are planning to promote the export of last year's and this year's green tea to North Africa. Success in this endeavor would provide significant support.</p>

<h3>First Redemption of US Dollar Bonds; Drawing to Be Held at the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office This Morning</h3>
<p>(Reported by our newspaper) The first lottery for the redemption of the 36th Year US Dollar Bonds is scheduled to be held publicly at 10:00 AM this morning on the fourth floor of 74 Dianchi Road in the city at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance. Chen Bingzhang, director of the Ministry of Finance's Public Debt Department, has arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and will preside over the lottery on behalf of Minister Yu.</p>
<p>Director Chen told reporters that the entire fund for the 36th Year US Dollar Bonds and short-term treasury bills has been fully allocated by the Ministry of Finance. According to the regulations for the issuance of gold bonds, the redemption period for US Dollar Bonds is set at ten years. Starting from the date of issuance, a lottery will be held every six months to redeem one-twentieth of the bonds each time. The winning bonds will be redeemed exclusively by the Bank of China for US dollar drafts, which can be freely used by the holders. The redemption period for short-term treasury bills is set at three years. Starting from the date of issuance, one-sixth of the bonds will be redeemed every six months without a lottery. The redemption will be jointly handled by the Central Bank and its branches with foreign exchange operations (a total of 19 locations). Payment will be made in legal tender based on the foreign exchange market price at the designated banks at the time of redemption. The first redemption date has been set for September 30th of this year. It is reported that from April 7th, when the US Dollar Bonds were first offered, to August 25th, a total of US$21,957,350 had been sold nationwide, with Shanghai accounting for US$19.58 million.

<h3>People's Food Association Establishes Storage and Transportation Office; Rice Merchants Request Amendment of Regulations</h3>
<p>In order to regulate rice supply in the city, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau plans to establish a Rice Storage and Transportation Office under the People's Food Adjustment Committee, which will be responsible for storing, transporting, and selling food in the city, with rice merchants participating. Rice merchants recently held a meeting of directors and supervisors and concluded that the authorities' conditions were too harsh and would affect the business of rice merchants. They have requested Director Wu to amend the implementation regulations. Rice merchants reportedly also have little interest in the proposal for a rice joint venture company co-managed by officials and merchants.</p>
<h3>Announcement of New Gold Prices by Ministry of Finance Deemed Untrue</h3>
<p>Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th: The Executive Yuan's News Bureau issued a statement on the 24th saying that the evening newspapers reported that the Ministry of Finance had ordered the announcement of gold prices in Nanjing and Shanghai this afternoon, or tomorrow morning if it was impossible to announce it today. According to a person in charge at the Ministry of Finance, this information is completely untrue and there is no such matter.</p>
<p>(Reported by our newspaper) A report stated that the Ministry of Finance would announce new gold prices on the afternoon of the 24th or this morning (the 25th), and it was also rumored that the government would amend regulations on import and export controls. According to a person in charge at the National Bank, there is no basis for the claim that the Ministry of Finance will announce new gold prices. As for amending regulations on import and export controls, that is also unfounded. However, the Executive Yuan is currently reviewing the regulations for processing imported goods registered in Shanghai, and the aforementioned rumor of amending regulations on import and export controls is likely a misunderstanding of this fact.</p>

<h3>New York China Institute Dinner; Marshall Attends and Speaks, Hoping to Raise Funds in the US to Support Chinese Culture and Education</h3>
<p>(United Press, New York, 23rd) Secretary of State Marshall has returned here after meeting with President Truman in Washington and deciding on strategies for various major issues. Today, he attended a dinner at the New York China Institute and delivered a speech. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie was also present. Marshall said that he hopes to raise funds in the United States to support education and culture in China. During his previous time in China, he saw that various facilities were extremely poor, making it impossible to carry out education and cultural undertakings. Besides the poverty of the Chinese people, this was the most heartbreaking thing. Foreign Minister Wang praised the work of the China Institute, saying that it is a non-profit organization with no political affiliations, solely handling scholarships and other funds for Chinese students in the United States on behalf of the Chinese and American governments. This kind of cultural and educational work is extremely important for Sino-American relations and should be promoted.</p>

<h3>New President of Tongji University, Ding Wenyuan, Arrives at the School to Take Office; Slogans Welcoming Him are Posted in All Departments</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ding Wenyuan, the newly appointed president of National Tongji University, has visited the school several times since his appointment was approved by the Executive Yuan. He officially took office at the school yesterday morning. All departments and affiliated hospitals of the school posted slogans, expressing "Welcome Mr. Ding to preside over the school affairs and build a new Tongji." After arriving at the school yesterday, Ding immediately discussed the future promotion of school affairs with the heads of various departments. The Student Union summarized the hopes of all students for President Ding and provided written suggestions. Representatives were sent to visit Ding to present the details, and they were answered separately. The representatives were all satisfied. Ding received reporters from this newspaper and gave his first speech after taking office: Tongji University has a history of 40 years, and its equipment is relatively complete. Many alumni serve in "military engineering" and "military medicine," and have achieved considerable results. The school has moved several times during the war and suffered great losses during the restoration period. In the future, we will try our best to replenish it. The life of professors is difficult and cannot maintain the minimum living standard of a family, and we will also try our best to improve it and strengthen its lineup. Secondly, I hope that students should especially abide by school discipline in order to seek the stability of the school. Under this principle, the spirit of academic freedom should be fully developed, and there should be mutual trust between the school and students. Students can frankly state any reasonable suggestions or requests to the school, and the school will be happy to adopt them. Ding finally said: The school's existing property and permanent address have not yet been determined. At present, the departments and units are scattered in many places, which is very inconvenient. He has asked the Ministry of Education to decide as soon as possible so that it can start leaving the school as soon as possible to build Tongji into a major international university. It is reported that Ding is the younger brother of the late geologist Ding Wenjiang. He graduated from Tongji Medical College and the University of Frankfurt in Germany. He has served as a lecturer at the University of Frankfurt in Germany and the deputy director of the affiliated Chinese College, a senator of the Executive Yuan, a counselor of the Examination Yuan, a counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Germany, the former president of Tongji University, a professor at Central University, and a specialist commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
