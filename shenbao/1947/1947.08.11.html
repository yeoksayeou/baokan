<h3>魏使晉謁主席長談　今赴台灣蒐集資料　即來滬與中美商界接觸</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕魏德邁十日上午十時謁蔣主席於黃埔路官邸，此爲特使自北方返京後與主席首次晤面，長談四小時，並共進午餐。所談內容不悉，惟衆信關於華北·東北局勢之現况與展望，必爲主要話題之一，蓋據使團某人員稱，魏等一行對中國不幸之北方印象至深。魏氏本人亦認為如北方獲得安定，工業建設有發展機會，中國殊不應有嚴重之經濟問題。午後魏氏與其顧問開會，並硏討華北東北旅中收集之資料。下午五時魏氏及司使相偕赴金陵大學之籟三　修堂作禮拜，司使衣白西服，魏氏衣藏靑上裝，白褲，兩人坐於右前方靠近風琴處，默然參加祈禱，傾聽講道，並與衆同唱聖詩，至下午六時禮畢後，談笑登車歸去。入晚，魏氏復至寗海路五號與美軍顧問團長魯克斯將軍共膳。魏氏一行除續幹事赫欽上校仍留京外，將於十一日飛台攷察，並定十三日飛滬，再與中美商界接觸，十五日飛穗，停一日或二日即返　對在華所得資料作全盤之整理，以爲擬報吿之準備，然後飛日轉韓。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十日電〕副主席孫科氏頃稱，魏特使對在中國所得之資料，並不十分滿意。孫氏在與合衆社記者君霍伯特單獨會見時談稱：魏德邁發現中國局勢較預料者爲惡劣。特使並對政府解決當前問題之若干努力，頗多非議。孫氏拒絕透露渠與特使所作之機密談話，惟稱渠個人感覺魏使所得似爲「各事均非百分之一百上軌道」。孫氏又稱：「當然吾人亦知此點，吾人如同特使，明瞭中國面臨甚多棘手之問題。渠正竭力搜集儘多之報道，俾能對局勢下一判斷。</p>
<p>孫氏稱，渠與魏德邁長談後，以爲特使對未來中國政府尙未有一決定。孫氏相信魏氏將來帶歸美國之報吿，具有極大的作用」。孫氏又稱：「無論如何，共黨正力圖擴充及堅守，惟現時政府擬加防守各綫，固若金湯」。渠指出共軍可能發展成較目下更大之威脅，又稱：共軍尙夠不上正規車之標準。孫氏相信，共軍有時採取恐怖手段，並驅使不願意作戰之人民作戰。記者問孫氏是否有確據可證明華方所稱蘇聯援助中共各節，孫氏答稱，蘇聯船隻正往來大連烟台之間，彼等必有所爲，彼等此舉必非在娛耳目也。</p>
<p>關於魏氏台灣之行，孫氏稱，若將戰前日人高度生產與接收後之經濟作一對比，顯屬不當。孫氏以爲日人應對台煻减產負責，蓋日本於戰時改蔗田爲稻田，以供三島食糧，况美國空製又破壞若干工廠，且地肥已吿枯竭，亟需施肥。政府接受台灣時，發覺情形惡劣，今後台灣恢復原狀，需時頗久，惟政府將勉力爲之。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十。電〕民主同盟發言人羅隆基，否認報紙所傳民盟已向魏使提出備意錄，要求美國停止援華之說。</p>
<h3>維護旅大主權完整　我考慮適當措置　美報抨擊蘇聯獨佔大連</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕關於美國將就蘇軍强佔大通再提抗議之事，我方對此極爲注意。據悉，外部對旅大之收回，盼之彌切，亦正考慮於一適當時機作進一步措置，以維護我領土主權之完整。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約九日電」此間所有報紙中，僅有斯克利浦斯霍　華德系之紐約世界電訊報及赫斯特系之美國人報兩家，顯著登載蘇聯禁止美國船隻駛入大連消息，而撰論批評此事者，僅爲世界電訊報而已。紐約時報及前鋒論壞報，均將此項消息登載於內頁，紐約時報之標題，爲「美國屈服於蘇聯在大連所宣佈之禁令」，前鋒論壇報之標題，則爲「美國差船禁止駛入鮮聯所擁有之大連一，世界電訊報社論稱，蘇聯以任意解釋中蘇條約，而在大連保有軍爭控制，以迄對日和約簽訂時爲止。蘇聯如根據此種理論，而僅拒絕簽訂對日和約，則可在該地繼續保有永久之控制。世界電訊報並指稱，在中蘇條約內，蘇聯曾同意支持蔣主席所領導下之國民政府，然蘇聯現則公開支持國民政府敵人之中國共產黨，刻並利用大連作爲彼等之作戰基地。技首先報道蘇聯禁止美國船雙駛人大連消息者，係斯克利浦斯·霍華德報系記者牛敦之上海電訊，內稱，自本年三月以來，未帶武裝之美國海軍差船，即曾被禁止駛人大連。此項消息嗣後得美國務院方面之證實，國務院現正考慮向蘇聯提出另一較強硬之抗議。據五先所發表之　　稱，此項抗議或將類似本年一月間送達莫斯科及南京之同一照會，惟措詞方面，將較爲有力也。</p>
<h3>孫副主席來滬</h3>
<p>張君勱離滬赴牯嶺</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕孫副主席十日晚十一時快車赴滬。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕民社黨主席張君勱，十日晨在滬乘輪赴潯，轉牯嶺避著，預定半月後返滬。</p>
<h3>台灣練兵事宜　尙在籌劃階段</h3>
<p>陸軍軍官學校仍設蓉</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕據消息靈通方面稱：中國國防部在台灣練兵事宜，美國陸軍顧問團將以顧問地位參與，惟此事尙在籌劃階段，須經由中美兩國政府核准。中國方面將由陸軍副總司令孫立人主持其事，俾所練新兵均成現代化師團。惟據可靠方面稱：魏特使台灣之行，與此事並無關係，認爲不在其調查範圍之內。美國陸軍顧問團對於練兵計劃，並不表示意見。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕據軍聞社訊：中央陸軍軍官學校由陸軍總部接管，該部已派員與國防部第五廳商洽，聞該校暫不遷移，仍在成都辦理。</p>
<h3>雷震談中日貿易</h3>
<p>嚴加管制對我無不利</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕政務委負亞東協曾理事雷震氏，昨就開放中日貿易問題發表意見稱：「在目前情况下，恢復中日貿易，吾人殊無過慮之必要，因政府旣決定對中日貿易作嚴格這管制，輸入日貨若非我國所需，自難獲得進口之許可。同時輸日之商品，亦將考慮是吾應予輸出，以及日本方面有無購買之需要。至於將來貿易之方式，其性質將與「以貨易貨」相仿。凡擬購買一定數量之日貨者，必需輸出同等價值之國貨」。</p>
<h3>彭學沛抵西安</h3>
<p>〔中央社西安十日電〕政委彭學沛十日土午十時由蘭飛抵西安，彭在此稍作勾留即返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社蘭州九日電〕政委彭學沛氏九日午自永登到達蘭垣。彭氏稱，西北雖貧，但前途大有可爲。最要者爲政治的安定。我們必須努力戡亂，急起直追，以求改進。繼對新疆情勢，作一槪括說明謂，目前並不若想像之嚴重，其對北塔山事件，則表緘默，僅謂：在迪盤桓五日後，即乘車赴北塔山實地考察，並在山上住留一日，所獲資料，俟回京後方可發表。彭氏日內即返首都，寗夏之行聞已作罷。</p>
<h3>滿洲里密山國境界標　被蘇迫移十五里　外蒙聲明我將予以駁斥</h3>
<p>〔本報長春十日電〕據軍方接獲情報，興安省之滿洲里及合江省之密山地方中蘇國境界標，被蘇人强迫移入我國境十五里，當地民衆至表憤慨。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕茶外交權威語記者，十日報　　合社九日莫斯科電，外蒙政府外交部發表公報稱，中國政府縱容軍隊七次攻入蒙境等情、純屬其一貫詭誣之辭，我政府日內將有正式聲明，予以駁斥。至該公報末提及之疆界綫問題，誠屬最近爭持之起因，然蘇蒙地圖之是否可靠，大成問題。週前我駐印大使羅家倫在德里所作之談話，至堪注意，是項談話提供之證據，使吾人猛醒於淸季之往事，我在黑龍江以北外與安嶺間之大幅疆土，即係由於帝俄移植界石，　　事實而喪失者。外蒙此種對北塔山事件詭辯之藉口，不過爲拙劣之抄襲，吾人已洞悉其奸，當不能由之隨心所欲也。</p>
<h3>回敎徒朝聖地的意義</h3>
<p>— 伍特公</p>
<p>每年一度由各省回敎促組成的朝聖團，必在本市乘船前往他們的目的地—麥加（回敎徒稱為滿克）。往年朝聖　經過首都到達本市時，只有敎胞予以招待，外界從未有人跟他們接觸，所以來去都是無聲無　的。而本年却和往年大不相同，各人由本省出發之前，即由當局和航空公司接治，豫留飛機客位，到了苜都聚集後，曾經蔣主席召見慰勞，並由各方面分日款待。最近該團到達本市，復由吳市長接見，潘　長代戈參議會舉行茶會，表示歡迎，而各報外勤記者亦多往該國暫駐所（老西門內小桃園回敎堂）訪問一切，寫成文章，刋於報端，因此乃引起一般讀者的熱烈注意。</p>
<p>政府何以本年一反前態，特別重視朝聖團，而予以種種便利，這自然有一種原因。按回敎徒極注得朝聖一舉，因為這是回敎古蘭經中所載的主要敎條之一。但此舉隊個人的信仰和宗敎的意義個，尙含有國民外交和國際政治的關係。我國回敎同胞為　居全國的共有五千萬人以上，西北邊陲各省却佔多數，而團結力非常堅靱。所缺憾的，邊陲各省一般國民敎育水準太低，而交通又極不便，回敎信徒大多數不識國文，再加僻處一方，見議　陋，以致頭腦簡單，國家觀念薄弱，很易受疆外野心者的誘惑。往來新疆省的朝聖者，在北疆的多假道蘇聯，在南疆的多假道印度：其他甘肅寗夏，靑海數省的，也有走大草地，繞道西藏前往者。我國回敎徒出國，不由本國外交部簽發護照，這不但在國際上常常招致不良的影響，且給抱侵略主義的外人以更易分化離間的機會。這對於國家，確含有一種潛在的危險性。</p>
<p>最不幸的是去年新疆和其他各省所組成的朝聖團，共有七十餘人，到了本市後，因還都關係，以致外匯護照及交通工具等都未能及時辦妥，而錯過了朝覲日期，於是該團團員不得不失望而返故鄕。試想他們花費巨款，跋涉長途，到了乘船出發點，仍不能償其終身所抱的宏願，這對於政府，常然將因誤會而造成不良的印象。不但他們如此，即國內的和僑居海外的敎胞，當時也都引爲巨憾。這件事對於回敎影饗尙小，對於政府影饗却大，因爲每年一度的朝聖典禮，參加者有全世界四十餘國的回敎徒，其中頗多要人學者，彼此同一信仰，志同道合，誼若兄弟，這在國民外交上很有關係。去年朝聖者大集團中獨缺中國一國，因此大衆對於我國政府發生種種疑問，且不免界有惡感。</p>
<p>本年朝聖日期將屆，首都中國回敎協會（理事長爲國防部長白崇稍將軍）有鑒於去年的過失，特發起組機朝聖團，豫先籌備一切。並經西北行營主任張治中將軍致電中央，促請贊助。最後由蒙藏委員等請蔣主席核定本年朝聖團以四十人爲限，每人得照官價購買英金外匯一百八十鎊，以充前赴目齣地的旅費。當該國由京來滬時，復由外交部。中國回敎協會，天山學會派員護送，並替他們辦妥出國的一切手續。更因朝聖者中有新疆維吾爾族數人，言語不通，由中央組織部派譯員兩人，以充舌人。這次招待的周到，爲歷來所未有，朝聖團當然萬分感激，日後達到目的地及將來回到故鄕時，自將宣揚政府的德音，而把去年的　惡洗滌一淨。（下文轉入第二版）</p>
<h3>北平硏究院鐳學所　開始硏究原子能　嚴濟慈談蘇聯已能製造原子彈　飛碟飛盤說乃庸人自擾</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕國　北平研究院電學研究所長嚴濟慈氏抵京，下榻中央研究院，與記者談下列四項問題：（一）我國研究原子能之現狀。（二）蘇聯能否製造原子彈。（三）原子能應用於一般工業之可能性。（四）所謂「飛碟」之出現，吾人應作何種看怯。嚴氏稱：（一）我國原子能之硏究，現方開始，以言北平硏究院鋪學硏究所仝人，現均集中其精力於此一專題，副院長李書華氏，對此亦有相當心得，蓋學術各部門，彼此間之關係，至爲密切，故目前物理學家無不涉獵及原子能問題也。所方之人材與設備，尙有待積極充實研究工作，始能有計劃地展開，研究員錢三強，在法國發現原子核新分裂法，物理學權威若利歐等，均推祟備至，所方亦未促請其返國，蓋國內之研究設備，自不能如歐洲各研究所完善也。（二）蘇聯目前己能製造原子彈，殆無疑義。如蘇聯果尙不能製造，則吾人實不能理解、原子能之研究，自一九三九年以後，各國始保守秘密，彼時德·法·美·蘇·英均已獲有相當成果矣。科學家不必交換實騐報吿，而實際上自能互相發明，美方投擲於廣易之原子彈，其性能與威力，不啻給予蘇聯科學家一種鼓勵或刺激，時至今日，已閱二年，蘇聯始能造原子彈，實不足爲奇。蘇聯之政治制度，便於集中人力物力作此一專門實騐，備本心與警覺性，亦促使彼等從事原子彈之製造也。至若法國，科學亦甚昌明，吾人則未必敢斷言其已能製造原子彈，因政治制度，經濟制度及其他條件，與蘇聯逈異也。（三）原子能將來必能應用於一般工業，原十能專家，刻正向此方面作各種試騐，惟問題並不如此簡單，即使就純粹科學之立塲言，原子能已可應用於工業，而其是否即予實施，有視乎企業家以及當時政治制度·經濟制度之決定。（四）「飛碟」之出現，係人類恐懼心理之不自覺底顯露，自原子彈發明以來，人類無不自危，</p>
<h3>陳總長視察開原　東北行轅進行擴大組織瀋陽長春龍江將設綏署</h3>

<p>〔本報瀋陽十日電〕陳誠總長十日上午九時由鄭洞國，周輔成陪赴開原視察，當日返瀋。</p>
<p>〔合衆肚北平十日電〕瀋陽電稱：參謀總長陳誠將軍，已親自布置防備東北共單在秋季之第穴次亦即最强烈之攻勢。陳氏正忙於主持軍事曾議，如共軍再度進攻，可能親自指揮戰事，國軍在吉林頗有進展，並已渡松花江突入共軍區域，惟自四辜街撤退之共軍並未遠遁，現正重行結集於四平及靠近長春一帶</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽十日電〕東北共軍將來發動第六次攻勢，國軍之勝敗足以決定全國軍事之命運。中國消息靈通方面稱：此爲參謀總長陳誠日前突然到此並與魏德邁特使作竟夕談之主題。東北軍事當局己作堅決應開之準備，此間軍事。政治將從事一元化，由陳總長為最高長官，而以東北保安司令鄭洞國爲副。一俟華北副事吿一段落，山東方面並將調軍來此增防。軍政一元化實爲補救已住缺點之要着。惟全盤機構仍甚薄弱，須強有力者主持其事，始足應付共軍未來攻勢。東北全燒目下戰事沉寂，此間亦平靜異常，僅於夜間遙聞郊外試砲聲而已，宣禁時間亦已自第夜十時延至十一時三十分開始。惟一切生活仍未脫嚴肅氣象。</p>

<p>〔本報太原十日電〕共匪僭號中華蘇維埃人民共和國，重要文件及對外宣傳已改稱，定在綏德西馬蹄溝設所謂中共中央西北辦事處，晋西俘獲共匪幹部供稱：匪現在鬥爭方式，爲殺死地主，打倒自耕農，已赤貧之地主士紳，雖供匪驅使，最後亦必殺害。和順，遼縣共匪强制婦女赤足，規定誰穿襪子鬥爭誰。</p>

<h3>社論　美國人民的警覺</h3>
<p>美國新聞週報最近發表了一篇社論，主張由美蘇兩國直接進行談判，以解決兩國在世界各處所發生的爭執。其所持的理由是：『如果要避免世界再發生戰爭，則唯有由美蘇兩國直接進行談判之一途。蘇聯有某種企圖與野心：在朝鮮，奧地利，德國所發生的問題，都是次要的，不過是整個問題的一部份而已，但是主要的問題，乃在美蘇兩國在這個世界上將怎樣和平相處？』至於直接談判的方式，則該報要求國務卿馬歇爾，范登堡，與貝爾納斯三人，組織一代表團，前往莫斯科，與史丹林會晤，共同討論一個全盤計劃，以調整美蘇兩國的關係。我們知道新聞週報在美國是最有力量的保守刋物，忽在此際提出美蘇直接進行談判的建議，實可視爲美國人民的警覺。不僅可以說明美蘇關係已演變到山窮水盡的地步；而且也足以證明，今日世界局勢的嚴重。</p>
<p>自第二次大戰結束迄今，正是兩個整整的年頭，兩年來國際政治的演變，不僅已將戰時世人所憧憬的理想境界，完全破碎，變成了鏡花水月；就是與戰後世人所期待的，也不啻南轅北轍。我們面對着這危機四伏的世界，無不表示失望；尤共是美國的朝野，對於今後世局的演進，莫不抱着無限的杞憂。新聞週報編輯大衛勞倫斯突然提出美蘇直接進行談判的建議，這就是美國輿論界對蘇態度轉變的先聲。我們研究發生這種轉變的原因，實由於下列各項因素所促成的：</p>
<p>第一，英怯兩國美元恐慌的表而化，加深了歐洲經濟的危機，勢將威脅及美國的出口貿易，本年六七兩月的對　貿易，早已呈現出江河日下的現象，長此每况愈下，可能引起美國一九四八年的經濟恐慌。而這種經濟恐慌的來襲，可謂美國朝野所一致恐懼的，故在尙未來到之前，美國不能不竭智盡能，設法挽救歐洲各國的經濟危機</p>
<p>第二，杜魯門主義與馬歇爾計劃，由於蘇聯的堅決反對，始終不肯妥協，均將宣告失敗。杜魯門主義的眞義，乃在美國運用其金元外交，協助世界弱小國家，以防制蘇聯勢力的侵入：但是美國援助希土兩國的結果，促成了匃保羅三國的政變，使歐洲劃分爲東西兩個歐洲，更爲明顯；但是束歐與中歐，在蘇聯控制之下，工業復興却有明顯的進展，對於美國威望，不啻是一。大打擊；反之，在西歐各國，由於英怯兩國發生美元恐慌，造成非常嚴重的經濟危機。馬歇爾國務卿看到這種情形，爲避免歐洲的分化起見，乃提出援助歐洲經濟復興的計劃，但是巴黎會講的結果，不僅蘇聯拒不參加，而且凡爲蘇聯所控制的各國，均不願接受美國有條件的援助。英怯雖欲單獨進行，但是兩國經濟危機日益嚴重，對於馬歇爾的援歐計劃，又無異是一大打擊。</p>
<p>第三，美國在杜魯門主義的號召之下，雖不斷向蘇聯行施壓力，但已遭遇到蘇聯强烈的反抗；蘇聯對於任何重要的問題，無不行使其所有的否決權，使美蘇兩國陷於相持的狀態下，不僅歐洲的問題無法解決；就是遠東的僵局，也不能打開。例如對德問題，因為莫斯科三國外長會議的不歡而散，使對德和約未能商獲成議，美國乃轉變目的，企圖先行建設德國，原欲提高德國的生產水準，詎意又遭到法國的堅決反對，法國如果不能壓制左派的意見，則法國的反對將更爲强列。再如對日問題，美國主張召開對日和約初步會議，蘇聯已表示拒絕，美國卽使摒棄蘇聯於會外，單獨進行，但是在美國與其他國家之間，也將有別種問題發生。目下中·英·菲·澳。加等國對於美國的對日政策，大半已表示不能完全滿意</p>
<p>所以，今日之美國，面臨着這樣嚴重的世界危機，實在應該深思熟慮，採取一勞永逸利人利己的賢明政策，俾使戰後世界安然渡過這一重難關：否則聽任大局自然發展下去，不設法挽救：則其結局，終將威脅及美國的和平與繁榮。</p>
<h3>蘇對封閉大連港</h3>
<p>美國新聞處日昨頒發消息，謂美國國務院業已證實蘇聯曾於本年三月間，通知美國當局，謂大連已成爲封鎖港，由軍隊加以管理；故自三月以來，美國海軍船隻卽不復進入大連。這一個消息發表之後，美國各報對此，均非常重視，且已表示憤慨，其中有世界電訊報，駁斥蘇方所持的理由稱：『蘇聯恣意曲解中蘇友好協定，謂在對日和約未簽訂之前，蘇聯對於大連卽可永久保持其在軍事上的控制權；準此而論，蘇聯僅需拒不簽字對日和約，卽可永遠控制大連矣。』同時據合衆社的報導，美國國務院對於蘇聯的非法行爲，也非常憤慨，擬於最短期內向蘇聯政府提出抗議。</p>
<p>關於大連問題，美國政府曾於本年一月三日，同時訓令駐中蘇兩國大使館，照會中蘇兩國政府，要兩國迅速實施中蘇條約關於大連的協定，俾大連在中國政府管理之下，恢復正常態。中國對於接收大連問題，也早已一再與蘇聯交涉，無如蘇聯採取延宕政策，一再敷衍，迄無交還中國的誠意。不論在法理上或有情義上，蘇聯均無拒不將大連交還中國的理由。論理在中蘇友好條約簽字之後，蘇聯就應該把大連交還中國的，但是蘇聯堅持着大連仍在對日交戰狀態之下，非至對日和約簽字之後，蘇聯不能將大連移交中國，這種强辭奪理的說法，實在不值得一辯，幾乎使人懷疑蘇聯外交當局連一點國際公理的常識也沒有了。所以蘇聯的居心何在？明眼人一望可知？不必細說了。大連市長龍學遂於本年二月間，曾在京向記者談接收大連問題稱：『最近市府派人赴大連視察，市內有中共軍四五萬人，蘇軍未駐在市內；故接收問題全在共軍，如僅派少數人前往，卽不能接收；如派軍隊協同前往，則勢必與共軍發生衝突。』</p>
<p>美國對於大連問題，雖然早已注意及此：但是一紙照會，如不繼以外交行動，是決不會發生效力的：而且蘇聯於三月間卽已封閉大連，當時美國爲何噤若寒蟬？至今始予以發表呢？所以遠東局勢發展到今天的地步，美國外交的坐誤事機，不得不負相當的責任：我們但望美國當局從此改變作風，任何事情，均須當機立斷。所謂「杜微防漸」，決不可坐誤時機的！</p>

<p>現在國外的回敎，大有蓬勃復興之象。阿拉伯大同盟早吿成立，印度巴基斯坦自治領近也誕生，埃及希望造成尼羅河流城的統一，正和英國相爭持，印度尼西亞共和國（回敎徒佔全體人民百分之九十以上）抱焦土政策，誓死和荷蘭決戰，土耳其在這次世界大戰中介於兩大强之間，始終保持中立，而爲地中海的屏障，大有助於聯合國，甚至非洲怯屬的摩洛哥也有要求獨立的運動，潮流激盪，勢難遏止。我國的回敎也許會發生感應，而有新運動。同時外方勢力復向邊省的回敎徒作政治性的誘引，新疆省界外蘇聯境內現在已有六個回族小共和國，計有回敎徒三千萬人。他們物質的建設，文化的程度，和生活的標準，都高出新疆省內的回族。這種吸引力眞可駭人。竊願政府當局高瞻遠疆，早定方略，今後對於國內的回敎徒，促進他們的文化事業，增進他們的一切福利。如這次所予朝聖團的優異待遇，無形中定可收到很大的效果。希望今後經濟好轉，外匯弛鬆，每年由政府組織很大的朝聖團，而早迎他們到京，作相當時期的留駐，涎請學者，每日向他們宣講國外大勢的大要，國內政治的情形，以及開民的賣任等等並許他們提出關於回敎的建議，而供政府採納，這樣定可造成回敎徒對政府齣極大向心力。</p>
<p>這次朝聖團共四十人，新疆省的佔過半數，內有女性一人·年齡最高者爲新疆艾不都拉大毛拉，七十九歲，六十以上者十九人。年齡最低者爲新疆省阿布都熱希特，才十六歲。其中聲望最高者，略舉數人如下：</p>
<p>（一）上述的艾不部拉大毛拉，是新疆喀什區人，維吾爾族，學識淵博，年高德劭，極爲當地敎胞所祟仰，民族觀念也很堅强。本年已是他一生中的第二次朝觀，麥斯武德主席特撥專機，將他由伊犂接到迪化，然後直飛首都。</p>
<p>（二）　乃則爾大阿衝，（即大敎長）是新疆迪化區人，維吾兒族，現年七十三歲，歷充新　省府委員，政務委員等要職，盡忠職守，品學兼優，潔得一般敎胞的敬仰和愛戴，現任迪化區敎長。</p>
<p>（三）穆罕默據阿里，是新疆島孜別克族，現年六十五歲，精通阿拉伯文，尤善讀法，前後曾留駐近東各國十餘年。現應靑海馬主席之聘爲西寗大敎長。」</p>
<p>朝聖團現定本年十三日乘船前赴香港，改乘藍烟囱公司輪船向紅海演準德進發，那是阿拉伯的門戶。登陸之後，將改乘長途汽車直達麥加，稍作休息，然後參加朝觀盛典。</p>
<p>連日本市各報多載有訪問朝聖團的紀事，因一方面口述，一方面筆錄，頗多不符事實之處，回敎徒讀了，多爲　　。筆者身爲回敎徒，所知較確，爲求潮實起見，略寫數行，貢獻給非回敎齣讀者。</p>
<p>回敎有四個主要的敎條，稱爲四柱：即（一）禮拜，每日自黎明至初夜，向眞主禮拜五次，都有一定的時刻，且大家須聚在敎堂中共同舉行。（二）守齋，每年在回曆的九月須守齋一月，自黎明起，絕對不進飲食。至日落時開齋，即可照常吃飯。（三）天課，凡積蓄金錢滿若干數額者，每年須以四十分之一周濟貧困，稱爲天課。其他物產亦有天課，但捐率較低。（四）朝觀，一生須至麥加朝覲一式，財力不足，或身有疾病者可免。每種各有意義，因限於篇幅，不能詳述。今只就朝覲一舉路爲一述。</p>
<p>朝觀，阿拉伯人譯音爲「哈治」，我國的回敎徒相傳稱爲「朝哈治」，讀別成爲「朝漢志」。漢志是省名，麥加便是該省的首府。這次用了「朝聖團」這個名辭，頗引起許多誤會，以爲所朝的乃樓哈默德聖人的墳墓，其實穆聖葬在默底納，距離麥加有相當的路程。朝覲者財力富裕的，或順便前往瞻仰，但不在朝覲禮節之內。，所謂「朝聖」，實際乃是朝聖地—麥加。因爲麥加有古聖的遺蹟，並且是回敎的發祥地，所以稱爲聖地。那古蹟是一座古建築，阿拉伯人稱爲「克而白」，我國回敎徒稱爲天房。據古蘭經說，眞主曾命古聖易卜臘欣（即舊約創世紀中的亞伯拉罕）父子修建道座古室，而成世界第一拜主之所。還有兩座小山，一名賽法，一名麥爾瓦，相距約四二〇公尺，穆聖始祖易司馬儀由他母親抱持第一次入阿拉伯進至兩小山之間時，所携革　中的水全經飲盡，於是他的母親乃環繞兩小山，覓取水泉，終乃覔得，使母子得以止渴，而免在炎陽之下渴死。天房和兩小山在回敎建立以前，早爲衆所尊敬的聖蹟。</p>
<p>朝覲者都須在回曆十二月初七日以前趕到麥加，即沐浴潔身，改穿戒衣。戒衣是白布兩幅，並不縫紉，裹住全身，頭上並不戴帽，平時所穿的服裝，以及一切飾品，都須卸除。女子且不得用化粧品。因爲朝覲是表示願棄絕塵世一切浮華，而以身心獻給眞主之意。朝覲者先至克而白即天房環繞七周，並吻嵌在牆上的小黑石一方，表示敬愛眞主的衷誠。（二）在天房圈內行簡短的禮拜後，即奔走於上述的兩小山之間，表示堅忍之意。初七日全體聚集，聽講朝覲的意義，初八日正式禮節開始，全體進至密那山谷（距麥加北約六哩）度夜。至初九日進至更北約五哩的阿爾怯平原和阿爾法山，紀念亞丹夫婦分散後重行會合。初十日爲宰牲節，每一朝觀者都在密那山谷宰牲一頭，象徵己身願為眞主犧牲，所宰之牲都散給附近貧民，並擲石子七個，表示拒惡之意。於是禮吿完成，便可卸去戒衣，改穿平時服裝。此後可住兩三日，即啓程返里。</p>
<p>爲了這一些禮節，不惜冒風塵行萬里，而且本年我國農曆六月，正值齋月，每夭自朝至暮，忍着飢渴，而在朝覲的長征途中。再，麥加適在熱帶，天氣非常炎熱，在行禮的幾天中，禿着頭，奔走於烈陽之下，以七八十歲的老者，竞能忍受這種辛苦，這種敬主的熱誠，堅忍的毅力，可算得世無匹敵了。</p>
<p>所以在各國語文中凡「萬衆傾向之地」或「信仰，政策，偉業等等的發源地」都以「麥加」一詞爲喻。（完）</p>

<h3>工黨內部意見不能一致　英政府面臨危機　鋼鐵國營問題最受重視　工黨議員今舉行特會作秘密檢討</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕工黨今已面臨　政兩年來內部分裂最嚴重之威脅。艾德禮及其閣員，今已遭遇左右兩派之反對。右派之保守黨及自由黨已結成鄂合陣綫，反對工黨所要求之指導人力之緊急權力，而在左派方面工黨內部之一部份黨員，已表示較去年反對貝文外交政策時更堅強之抗議。工黨議員約四百人定於星期一開會，將就三項問題向艾德禮及其顴間提出質問，即要求裁减更多之兵員，採取更有力之設計，使集中全國人力及物力於生產工業，而　重要者即爲要求政府充分實行工黨之鋼鐵國營計劃。衛生部大臣培文最近又以左實領導者之身份出現，渠嘗明白表示絕對反對就鋼鐵業國營之計劃有所讓步，而報紙所傳渠於不達目的時不惜辭職之說，至今尙未由培氏加以否認。鋼鐵業國營之問題逐漸已成政府就肚食生義政策之執行，從事讓步，或更趨急進之指示標誌，因此工黨後座議員對於此一問題，極席重視。政府就鋼鐵業國營計劃所採之任何決義，勢將影響應付經濟危機方案之整個途徑。政府首要閣員中在工黨內部意見分歧之情形下，尙能保持其聲譽者，唯商務大臣兼經濟設計負責者克里浦斯一人。左翼份子責外相貝文為反對裁減兵員最力之一人，而樞密大臣莫里遜則被指為遲延實行鋼鐵國營計劃之負責者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕艾德禮首相今日被保守黨指為覓取「全面極權」，處理英國經濟危機。同時，工黨內部對於政府之國營計調，亦發生新爭執。聞一部份閣員反對在此經濟危險時代實行鋼鐵國營計劃，爰有國會工黨議員特別秘密會議之召集。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十日電〕據外交界可靠方面訊，英國工黨政府將在在月之內撤退駐義大利及希臘之英國軍隊，以挽回英國經濟危機。該方面稱：據非官方估計，英國駐義軍隊約在一萬至一萬五千人之間，英國將不論對義和約是不吸時實行，將予以撤退。左派自由份子曾向工黨政府加施壓力，促其撤退駐希軍隊，按英駐希軍隊現已减少至五千餘人。又訊：艾德禮首相定十日下午八時一刻向全國廣播，要求全國在此經濟期中舊動工作。</p>
<h3>英美法三國將舉行會議　檢討德工業水凖　但並不影響英美魯爾煤產會議</h3>
<p>〔路透肚華盛頓九日電〕馬歇爾國務卿業已表示同意迅即舉行英法美三國會議，以討論德國工業水準及煤斤問題。馬歇爾此項決定，已由美國駐怯大使於今日吿知法國政府，同時並以副本一份交英國駐華盛頓代辦巴爾　。</p>
<p>馬卿致怯政府之照會有云：「美國政府準備同意不稍遲延即行召開美英法三國代表會議，討論重訂德國工業水準之計劃，傅使該計劃最後由英美政府採用以前，得以參酌怯國之意見，並就該計劃之目標，予以研究及解釋。關於魯爾煤礦之經理及管制，美國政府亦準備與英法兩國政府接受並討論怯國之意見。關於舉行德國工業水準及魯爾煤礦經理及管制問題討倫之建議，即將知照法國政府」。國務院發言人謂：此一會議之日期及地點隨後將予宣布，與會代表，不致為內閣閣員，但盼法政府不久能激高級專家來華盛頓。渠並聲明召開三國會議之計劃，並不妨礙定於星期二舉行之英美魯爾煤產會議。馬歇爾之照會，表示業已接受法國就英美所議定德國工業水準計劃所提之抗議。馬卿承認業已接獲怯大使龐奈交來之法國照會，其中聲明法國政府對於德國問題重視。渠並透露業於七月二十一日照會巴黎，允在法國政府得有合理之機會以表示其意見前，暫緩宣布德國工業計劃，彼時馬歇爾曾謖渠正與貝文外相就此一問題交換意見而貝文則答以英政府正在考慮此一整個問題，由此可見馬歇爾今日致怯國之照會，係得英政府之完全同意。國務院發言人復謂：目前尙無使法國參加下週二之英美魯爾煤產會議。</p>
<h3>美影片商希望國務院協助　迫使英改變徵稅政策</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕據悉：好萊塢英國影片商代表將晤國務院官員，使國務院得以支持影片商之立塲，迫使英國政府改變徵收影片所得稅百分之七十五之政策，觀察家相信美國電影業協會會長瓊斯登昨日宣布之禁運緊急措施，意在恐嚇英國，迫其改變原意。禁運令之延長，對於美國電影業，爲一重大之打擎，將不得不使好萊塢之製片工作大爲减少，而僅事製造賤值之影片。</p>
<h3>奧斯汀主張　不得濫用否權</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十日電〕聯合國美首席代表奧斯汀今日廣播稱：聯合國無需改變憲章，亦可解決各項世界問題。奧氏深信憲章不必修改，然認爲憲軍並非爲一靜止之工具，而爲一活動之有機體。渠稱吾人所欲了結之主要事　，偶在這德方面。此非否決權之運用問題，而爲否決權之濫用問題，故網際倫理水準必須予以促進及提高。另一聯合國美代表杜勒斯最近曾要求减少安理會之五張否決權。一般認爲今日奧氏之聲明，更進一步表示美國或將在未來聯合國大會中建議修正五强否決權之運用，然不顧眞正修改憲軍。杜氏曾表示否決權不應用於行政事務上。</p>

<h3>踉蹌擁擠絡繹不絕　郵政大樓形形色色</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕烈日當空，綠色的郵政大棋也似乎面對蘇州河喘着氣。</p>
<p>在這大樓裏面，寄信的人都拿着一封信穿俊似地找尋着自己有關的窗洞，窗洞裏面郵員們在不住地揩抹着汗珠…………。</p>
<p>阿彌陀佛　你碰不得</p>
<p>突然，一位和尙擠進了「掛號」的窗口，在大袈裟中鄭重地拿出了一部密封整潔的方形紙包。</p>
<p>「大和尙，這包裹是什麼書？」窗洞內的女戰員親切地問他。</p>
<p>和尙雙手合十：「這是小僧沐手敬書的正楷金剛經，我要掛號寄到……」女職員要爲他接過來過磅決定郵資了，和尙立刻縮回紙包，搖幌着腦袋，「阿彌陀佛，你磁不得！」結果一個男性職員用毛巾拭净了變手，恭敬地收受了這部郵件。</p>
<p>四字濃黑十萬火急</p>
<p>在和尙滿意地轉身離開以後，隔　「快信」窗口跟跟蹌蹌地跑來一個鄕下佬模樣的人，手裏拿着的信一個角落被燒焦了，上面還插着兩根顫巍巍的鷄毛，他惶急而又焦慮的向窗內說：</p>
<p>『這是一封要緊的信，務必請你用「鷄毛報」寄出去！』</p>
<p>郵員們爲他那封信背上濃黑的「十萬火急」四個大字所感動了，他懇擊地解釋現在已沒有傳驛遞郵的「鷄毛報」，但是有一日千里的航空信。他宛轉地向這位鄕下人保證郵局能在最快的時間內把這封信送到目的地。</p>
<p>咫尺天涯愛人何處</p>
<p>一封從廣西恭城發來的信，封面寫着不完全的地址：「上海二四二四號劉裕祥」。還有一位楊先生發出的也許是情書吧。大槪是作書時情緒太緊張了，信封上祇甜蜜而懵懵地放着「本市賀杏蓮小姐」幾個大字。天涯咫尺，到那裏去導這些先生小姐去呢？於是這些郵件統統被檢入郵局地下室的一個角落。陰暗森冷，一具具的長方木盒，陳列着不知多少從遼遠的地方跋涉過重山深水的信件。這裏面也許有來自關中的芳馨的吻痕，也許有溫暖的慰藉，有焦急的期待，也有迫切的申訴；現在都由郵員們分担起它們重逢的命運！</p>
<p>一字之誤四方探投</p>
<p>因爲一封信上一個字的錯誤，郵局便要在七條中正路，五條中山路的「東南西北中」五個方向中流徙轉戌；或是要到「越界築路」區內，在三種路名，四種門牌中去發掘；或是要在上海兩條同名的寗波路，黃河路……去探詢；但是垂危絕望的郵件很多終於得救。</p>
<p>光怪陸離一批賊贜</p>
<p>郵局內也有一所規模很大齣舊貨攤，這些舊貨的米源，雖然不是私貨，但的確是賊贓。　手們在市區內得手之後，除了錢鈔外，其餘向例都是慷慨地乏進郵簡的。所以支票，鑰匙，身分證……每天源源不絕地流進了綠色的招領櫃，使郵局內平添了許多光怪陸離，琳瑯滿目的新的「舊貨」。有一位來自四川的向　華小姐，大約也慘遭了偷兒一摸，所以這裏就放着很多她與愛人的情意纏綿的照片。</p>
<p>綠色意義　竹報平安</p>
<p>有一位本市某大商行齣老司務，一天突然搬了幾十封信件來寄發，職員仔細翻閱，發覺這些信的發出日期都是半月以前的，問他這當中的綠故，纔知道被他放在家裏忘記了兩星期之久了。郵員們苦笑着說：「假使收信的人不知道其中究竟，我們的趕班郵筒，行動郵局車，以及一番改進郵政的苦心，都將被他輕輕的抹煞了。」</p>
<p>據說交部俞部長曾經覺得代表中國郵政的綠色太深，囑須改淡。當初郵傳事業的採用綠色，原是根據「竹報平安」一語而來，綠竹旣是象徹平安，那麼今後在淡綠光輝下的郵政，當可更加年靑地爲謀取公衆便利而求進步了。</p>
<p>出售郵票之郵局女職員　（本報攝）</p>
<p>逸園怪聲四起　三分鐘選出「國際小姐」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕所謂「一九四七年國際小姐」選舉舞會，終於在昨日灤夜在逸園舉行。參加選舉者計有七女性，包括國籍僅二，除二人爲中國籍外，餘皆爲俄籍。分列爲一號，二號，三號，四號六號，九號，十六號。最後據宣布：四號（張雨靑）以八千一百票當選第一名，三號（柳雲）以六千票當選第二名六號（俄籍）以四百票當選，第三名。</p>
<p>「國際小姐」之選舉，事前曾在大街小巷遍貼廣吿招紙，原定本月七日舉行，後臨時延期至昨日，然迄昨晚十」時，尙屬音訊杳然，似事前一無準備。直至十一時餘，麥克風傳出報告，謂「選舉國際小姐開始，請參加者到台上來」，競選者均忸怩良久，然後由一俄籍男子名彼得羅夫者，個別攙至音樂台前，報明號碼及姓名後，仍由彼得羅夫相扶，在舞池周圍走一圈子。參加競選者，均衣便裝，中以一名安琪兒之俄籍婦人顏色最爲鮮艷，彼衣粉紅色麻布西服，邊綠鑲以白邊，惟以其年舉較大，令人有不相稱之感覺。「國際小姐」在舞池中繞圈而行時，姿態各不相同，走路之姿勢，當以六號最爲老練，惜其體較胖，且足微跛耳。</p>
<p>「國際小姐」之選舉，約歷一刻鐘即吿完成。蒞會之觀衆，以「儀式」草率，不免失望，五時言論紛紛，怪聲四起，旋即一哄而散。</p>
<p>記者昨詢逸園負責人，選舉「國際小姐」究係何人主持。據稱，係一俄人以二十世紀戲院協曾名義借該園塲址舉行，與逸園當局無關。詢以當日選舉票之收入總額數字，則稱尙無法估計。惟據其所公佈「國際小姐」前三名之票數總額一八一〇〇票計，（每票售五萬元），則一夜之收入，巳達九億〇五百萬元矣。</p>

<h3>宓錫寵播講　拉丁美洲華僑生活</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座中華自由電台，舉辦第十九次星期日特別廣播，請駐拉丁美洲尼加拿瓜國前領事宓錫寵（見國）播講：「拉丁美洲華僑槪况」，宓氏現調任菲律賓納卯城領事，渠出使拉丁美洲華二十年，茲紀錄其演詞大意如下：</p>
<p>西班牙遺風猶在</p>
<p>拉丁美洲就地區言之，北自墨西哥經中美洲，南至阿根廷，連同位居於加利比海之古巴·海地·多密尼根，共計二十國。除海地用法文及巴西用葡葡牙文外，其餘十八國之言語文字，皆以西班牙文爲主。西班牙之遺風迄今尙在。在此區域之中，地藏甚富，天賦亦厚。輸出以咖啡爲最大宗，其他如古巴之禟，秘魯之棉，墨西哥之白銀，尼加拿瓜之黃金，在國際上亦有相當重要地位·華僑在拉丁美洲已有八十餘年之歷史，以粵籍僑民爲最多。華僑人數在古巴有十萬餘人，在秘魯約近一萬人，在其他各國或二三千人，或四五千人不等。華僑之戰業種類甚夥，大都以經營小本商業爲主，但從事晨業者亦多，並有相當成效。</p>
<p>戰前之種種限制</p>
<p>在此次大戰以前，日本僑民之在秘魯者，有六萬人，在巴西者有四十八萬人，但因日本當時為世界強國之一，拉丁美洲各國政府對於日僑入境完全自由，惟對我國人民則有種種限制。往往在其移民律上載有禁止入境字樣，對於已入境之華僑，在居留手續上，在一般業務上，加以苛待。如最低資本額之規定，少於定額者，不得開始營業。如商店地點之限制，一般商店非先經政府核准，不得自由遷移，其欲由熱鬧街道遷入邊僻地區則可，若欲由冷靜地段遷入中心市區則不可。如保工條例之訂立，舉凡外僑工商各業之職工人員，必須以所在國之人民充當之，其比例或爲百分之七十五，或爲百分之八十。如華僑敎育所受壓迫，除援例向當地政府立案外，華僑學校校長必須以其本國人充當之，敎授漢文時間，在有些國家，每星期不得超過六小時。</p>
<p>對祖國素具熱忱</p>
<p>總之，拉丁美洲之華僑人數，雖然不多，資本雖然不厚，事業雖然不大，然對祖國素具熟忱，在抗戰八年中，更能爲國努力宣傅，出錢出力。對於各種捐款，如醫藥捐，棉衣捐，草鞋捐，航空救國捐，莫不踴躍輸將。對於國幣公債，美金公債，以及節約儲券等，亦能大量購買，並依照政府憲旨，以大國民之風度，隨時隨地協助使領各館，實現國民外交之工作。</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，伙國駐紮拉丁美洲各使領館，遵照中央抗戰建國政策，向駐在國政府訂立友好條約者，有古巴·多密尼根·阿斯大黎加·阿根廷·厄瓜多等國，不獨在原則上完全平等，即對於兩締約國人民入境問題，亦多改善之處。</p>
<p>增設使領館多處</p>
<p>我國政府為增進邦交，及保護僑民起見，在過去數年中，在拉丁美洲增設使領館多處，目前計有駐墨西哥·阿根廷·巴西·智利·秘魯等大使館，及駐古巴·多密尼根·巴拿馬·哥倫比亞·委納瑞拉·哥斯大黎加·厄瓜多等公使館，添設總領事館，領事館·亦不在少數。</p>
<p>查聯合國爲目前維持世界和平之唯一機構，拉丁美洲之二十國，皆爲聯合國之會員國，在大會中有相當之力量，亦有相當之表決權，各國政府加以重視，因理所當然。</p>
<h3>特別廣播節目</h3>

<h3>周佛海表兄唐健侯被訴　歷任偽職　囤積是務</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕湖南人唐健侯，係周逆佛海表兄。周擻叛國時，曾在南京組織偽中報社爲宣傳機關，唐於廿九年入該社印刷部（亦名新中印刷公司）充任經理，嗣調升中報社經理，直至勝利爲止。平時以投機囤積爲務，曾一度出長偽蚌埠禁烟局長，經前蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局函送高檢處偵查，首都高檢處亦因據邱忠德吿發，移送併案辦理。該案經高檢處偵查後，以唐服務偽中報社，先後担任印刷部經理，中報社經理，據邱忠德　吿發，及前敵偽產業處理局派員調查報吿，事實已極明顯。高院復提訊偽中報肚副社長金雄白，供陳屬實。至唐出任偽蚌埠禁烟局長，由邱忠德吿發，情詞歷歷，自堪置信，而被吿平時囤積是務，復於處理局調查文件敍述明瞭，核其行爲，顯有懲治漢奸條例第三條，第二條第一項第一款之罪嫌，爰依特種刑事訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二三〇條第二項提起公訴。</p>

<h3>堅守臨朐完成大捷的　第八軍軍長李彌</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員邵償之五日靑島訊〕臨朐大捷，第八軍李彌所部堅苦卓絕，固守臨朐，達成任務，觀察家以爲臨朐之挺，爲山東的四辜街之役。主席曾頒電嘉獎該軍軍長李彌，李字炳仁，雲南寳山人，現年四十歲，中央軍校第四期畢樂，會任徘，連，營，　長，十六七年即効命疆塲，參加北伐，並曾任政治工作。在江西剿匪時期，擔任縣政工作，對地方行政頗多建樹。抗戰軍　，復恢復其戎馬生活，任旅長，副師長等職，嗣在鄂西六戰區司令長官陳誠領導下作戰，所率部隊，即現已馳譽全國之榮譽第一師，當時任該師師長。李氏因　著戰功，提升爲第八軍副軍長兼湖南洪江師管區司令，作整訓部隊工作。滇緬軍事吃緊時，該軍奉令馳往增援，造成著名的「松山大捷」，中外重視，此後即調升爲軍長，以迄於令。</p>
<p>李氏自奉甚儉，而體恤部下，全軍上下一心，得力於李氏平素薰陶。李氏在朱培德將軍部下任團長時，曾發生一事，陳辭修將軍一日奉密令，將朱部繳械改編，李氏獲悉此訊，即將全團人馬帶往南昌行營，親謁委員長報吿，謂渠係委員長學生，受其敎育：「革命軍人不繳械不投降」，因此，將部隊帶來，請委員長派員點騐接收，委員長當予慰勉。此亦可見李氏性格一斑。</p>

<p>各校意見</p>
<p>立信潘序倫稱：該校下學期擬收學費一五〇萬元，敎授待遇向係依國立學校調整，如收費過低，中途不能增收學費，敎授待遇即不能調整，學生方面，私校學生成績並不低劣，故應盡量設置獎學金俾淸寒學生得以就學。滬江林卓然稱：該校學費擬在一五〇萬至二百萬元之間酌收。大夏歐元懷稱：學費高，學生家長不能負担，學生减少，學費低，學校辦理困難，敎授待遇無法調整，故須在二者兼顧之下，謀致合理解決。聖約翰凃羽卿稱：該校與之江東吳兩校，已作初步決定，學費擬收一二〇萬元，雜費三十萬元，較上學期增加三倍。之江王裕凱引用市敎育局顧局長目前關於學費問題之發表談話，敎員待遇及學校收費，應以米價爲標準。上海法政學院郭孝先稱：該校上學期獲獎學金學生佔全校總人數四分之一，如各校獎學金名額增加，當有助於上述各項問題之解決。上法褚鳳儀稱：希望暫不作硬性規定。</p>
<p>討論結果</p>
<p>數經詳細討論，結果決定：（一）在學生家長負担能力及教授應有合理待遇之雙重兼顧下，作初步決定：各校下學期學雜費最低爲一四〇萬元，最高不得超過二百萬元。（二）各校助學金名額：全免不得少於百分之十，半免不得少於百分之二十。（三）成立永久性之助學金委員會，推進勸募工作，推定復旦，立信，大同，聖約翰，滬江，美專，同濟，同德醫學院，光華，交大等十一校爲委員，由復旦召集，籌劃具體進行辦法。關於敎授待遇問題，暫未作決定。</p>

<h3>故都敎育的危難</h3>
<p>— 本報駐平記者宋紹柏</p>
<p>讀書和敎書者成了當前不易救濟的問題</p>
<p>國家危難，逐日加深，敎育問題也就更形嚴重。今日談敎育，大家幾乎已無暇顧及制度，師資，設備，每日困惱着先生學生的僅剩了生活問題。先生敎書，張口是爲了吃飯，學生投考學校，其選擇目標，已不是學校的好壞，而是花錢多少的問題了。這種情形，在北平允其顯著。</p>
<p>北平學生的失學問題，在今年著期看來，更使人擔憂，過去學生失學的主要原因，是學校少，學生多，有些學生想讀書，而因得不到學校失學了。今天的情形，已經不同，學校少固然還是迫人失學的原因，主要的還是原已得到學校而且是讀得起書的學生，今天也一批批失學了。普遍的失業，戰區的擴大，正使這種情形，有加無减，與日俱增。談起來人們就說：「一家人吃飯還無着落，　還念得？」大家都相讓自已的念過兩天書的子弟找個事做，這樣同時還加重着失業的恐慌。</p>
<p>過去考得了國立院校的學生，因爲有公費大部還可維持，而今根據敎育部的命令，從卅六年度起，對於升入大一的學生，公費取消，改成了獎學金。依照這辦法，可享公費（獎學金）的已由百分之八十降低到百分之廿五，（這裏還有成績操行等限制）據統計，所謂淸寒學生，幾乎佔了全體學生的百分之九十，原來都指望了公費，今則將有百分之六十以上的學生要失學。這對於今年升入大一的學生。，緊在是一個嚴重的打擊。爲此北平各國立大學先修班學生組成了「爭取繼續大學公費制度聯合會」，要求敎育部維持原來辦法。他們認爲今天國家旣恢復了戰時體制，論理因戰時而設立的公費，也不應取消。此外敎部規定的三分之一學分不及格，即停發公費，對於一部功課不好的學生也是致命打擊，經交涉，淸華已允許這種學生可以享受半公費，北大尙無反應。</p>
<p>家在共區斷絕經濟來源的學生，正日漸增多，這些學生除去少數讀國立大學而取得公費者以外，他們幾乎只有失學了，有的謀職業，謀不得職業的，只好回家去。他們認爲政府口口聲聲爭取靑年而不爲這些靑年學生解決問題，是大大的失策。現在一些誓死不回共區的學生，也組織了同學會，要學取與邊疆學生軍人復員學生同等的待遇。自費學生有的要在入學以前，必須先覓得可以繳納飯費的保證（如清華），否則就拒絕入學。</p>
<p>私立大學，下學期的學費，至少爲五六十萬元，除去少數有資產的當家子弟，加上每月的飯費，那眞不是一個普通家庭所能擔負的。有的就正在利用暑假作苦工，如同素以量族學校見稱的燕京，正有不少學生爲學校拆牆拔軍，以獲取每小時二千元的代價。另有少數學生得到國際基督敎學生救濟會的自助工作，每天六小時，一個月五十萬元作些文職工作。有的自組補習學校、臨時收幾個學費。想不來辦法的一部私立大學學生，有的就不惜降低年級，去投考國立大學新生，期圖省些　費，這次北大，淸華，南開，三校聯合招生，就發現了不少這種學歷。三校總共也收容不了二千人，而僅北平考區的總報名數就有五千多，希望讀免費的學校又豈是容易的？那些落第的學生有幾人讀得起私立大學，眞是間題。</p>
<p>中學生的困難情形尤其嚴重，因爲縱然考上了市立中學，少出幾個學費，飯費却必須自已拿。爲了市立中學學費少（三萬五萬），便都來投考。今年北平的市立高中，共錄取了九八六人，初中錄取了一·二三〇人，投老的却有二五·七八六人，平均十四個人取一個，剩下的二萬三千多人，有多少讀得起學費四五十萬元的私立中學？而且一部分私立中學，學飯費要入學時一總繳齊，省得打麻煩，但有幾個家庭能一次籌得出一二百萬元爲可讀可不讀的子弟繳費？</p>
<p>另根據平市敎育局的報吿，北平六至十二歲的失學兒童，達學齡兒意的百分之四十，這些失學兒童的日常工作就是欲煤渣賣報，作童工。敎育局上學期計劃暑期後以卅億元增校增班，但敎育部沒有批准。</p>
<p>前兩天清華學生金承義爲恐喪失公費，怨恨敎授判分不及格，憤而出刀行刺敎授的事，正是這嚴重問題的一國悲慘的說明，</p>
<p>先生方面，同樣呈現了排擠的現象，若千市立中學，爲了人浮於事，一批批先生校長被擠掉，繼之者是互相揭露陰私，令人哭笑不得。東北的仗打到一楊糊塗的時候，敎授們紛紛逃進關來，爲吃飯問題，大家也不能不　營一下，院長主任們不惜降格以求，若干人又被擠掉了。能在國外想個辦法的人，正競相謀求出國，在國外講學應當今夏回國的敎授，又多不願回來。前幾天各國立院校敎授，曾聯名給胡適一封信，請胡爲他們的待遇再向政府想想辦法，胡適是否就想得出呢？這固然不是一個簡單問題。</p>

<p>該隊爲檢討南征軍實力，於三日（週日）約海軍隊會戰加山　，海軍隊在義賽時，曾擊敗華聯，故日昨之戰，吸引球迷不少，球賽在風雨中開始，南華由李應堂親自督師，上半時凈勝三球，建功約是錦河，石金，碩友。下半時；育德出塲，德祺退休，「小李」大有父風，獨射兩球，海軍亦扳回一隻，成五對一終塲。是日南華排陣：</p>

<h3>江灣市體育塲　接收又生障礙　建築損壞幾乎無法下手　滿住新兵蓋上臨時房屋</h3>
<p>上海市立體育塲江灣本塲，勝利後由聯合勤務總司令部借用，原定本年六月底全部交還，以便修理，籌辦第七屆全國運動會，但因故未能實現，旋經一再交涉，始由聯勤總司令部命令上海港口司令部即行交還，體育塲亦奉命接管，爲磋商交接手續起見，體育塲塲長蔣湘靑曾於本月四五兩日往訪港口司令部軍械處賀處長壽麟洽談，結果尙稱美滿。經洽談後，港口司令部即於七日準備交還。蔣塲長爲求交接之手續迅速實現計，又於八日上午九時，偕同賀處長徐副處長等，暨聯勤部第二軍械補給庫陳庫長美年，再往江灣查勘整個塲地，及建築物，並協商交接具體辦法。當作下列協議：（一）被炸毀一半之市體育塲，經雙方換文後，即可於本月十五日左右先辦交換手續。（二）上海市體育館，市游泳池，及其他建築物，陸續交還。（三）炸毀部份尙有多量危險品，被壓於底層，由市政府函請聯動總部工程署派工兵協助淸除。該塲現實情况，約述如下：</p>
<p>滿目瘡痍</p>
<p>除市運動塲部份外，其他各建築物，就現狀言，決非兩三個月內所能出讓，市體育館之　層交叉地板，早被敵兵全部拆除，內部亦相當損壞，四周之下水道，均已不通，每經大雨，館內即積水甚深。市游泳池之池身與房屋，情形更差，機器房雖尙大致完好，但有一打水機，已失去一蓋。市運動塲內部之田徑塲，已相當於西四南各省之山地，如欲找尋跑道，須發掘數尺之深，若干土丘與亂石，有高達六七尺之者，大部平面，已爲石子，鐵片，與零亂之水泥銅骨所籠罩，野草　生，樹木茂盛。至已炸毀之半團，如欲重建，五六年內恐少希望。即以清除言，所費亦將駭人聽聞，蓋斷斷讀纔之鋼骨水泥塊，決非人力所能移動，舉目四顧，幾乎無法下手。最感棘乎者，被壓於底層之危險品，尙有相當噸數，若由普通工程人員淸除，非再度發生爆炸不可，如由工兵負責淸除，則似宜於接收之前爲之，否則勢必將來無人負責。</p>
<p>新兵擠滿</p>
<p>市體育塲未炸毀之牟關，所有房屋，確已出淸，但已作爲新兵招待處，目前住有三千人，遍走廊亦皆擠滿，此項新兵，走一批來一批，據稱日內尙有七千人陸續到達。新兵招待委員會　於全部房屋之已插足無地，特又在田賽塲上搭蓋臨時房屋，以便容納，刻正興工中，同時並擬以市游泳池路加修理，作爲新兵沐浴之所。據蔣塲長稱：市運動塲之接收，已無問題，但無所得，且速前往接收之職工，亦須多搭臨時房屋，始有容身之地。蔣已將上項情形，面陳敎育局李副局長，（顧局長在台灣講學）並轉向市政府請示。良以被炸毀部份，已得補償十億元，且已由工務局具領，足敷發掘跑這，整頓田賽塲，舖蓋草皮及若千零星修理之需。</p>

<h3>絲織業昨開會員大會　討論人絲配售問題</h3>
<p>決議對中央信託局提出四項要求</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四區絲織工業同業公曾臨時曾員大會，於昨日上午九時起，在市商會大禮堂舉行。到市社會局代表周濂澤，市商會代表潘士浩，工商輔導處代表陳悟皆，工業協會代表田和卿，及該會會員三百餘單位，代表三百餘人。蘇州·杭州·盛澤·各地絲織廠，亦均派代表出席。大會由蔡听濤担任主席，延至中午十二時，始吿結束。</p>
<p>昨日會議重心，集中討論中信局之人造絲配售問題。會議過程，各會員情緒殊爲激烈。良以絲織廠處茲時艱中，原料供應，極感困難。以中信局配售之人造絲爲例，配源即時吿中國，使各廠不得不求諸黑市。即以該局配量最多時言，亦不足該　需要量五分之一。茲者配價又提高至與黑市相等，蓋使各廠感覺舉步總艱。而目前各廠產品滯銷價呆，一方面工繳等費，又不得不經常支出。各廠對繼續維持開工問題，感感消極。然一面方面以各廠僱用工人頗衆，爲維持工人之生活問題，關廠當非常局所許可，各廠深感進退維谷。</p>
<p>昨日會議塲中，各廠代表，咸表無意繼續經營，情緒激昂，幸市商會潘士浩等剴切勸導，空氣始轉綏和。旋對中信局之人造絲配售問題，討論一過，獲得決議案四點：</p>
<p>大會決議四項要求</p>
<p>（一）要求中信局遵照國定利潤額，決定人造絲配價。按國定一般利潤，均爲照實際成本，（據悉：中信局人造絲每箱成本價，爲美金一百九十元）。加合法利澗百分之</p>
<p>（二）如中信局認爲絲織業有低價配進‘高價黑市售出之嫌，則可以代織方式，將原料發配予絲織業，由該業代織成品，然後予以收購，該業僅收合法之工繳費用</p>
<p>（三）要求中信局組織人造絲配售委員會，該會構成人選，除中信局外，應包括市政府。市商會。工業協會，及絲織業公會等代表，俾公開處理人造絲配售問題。</p>
<p>（四）要求中信局改善人造絲配售辦法。中信局目前配售辦法，於每週一上午十時決定配額後，十一時即需繳款，四五日後方可取到棧單，待出貨到手，至少需時一週。茲請改善爲付款後即取棧單出貨，免因貨款拆息耗損，增加成本。</p>
<p>推定代表晉謁市長</p>
<p>最後並推定蔡昕濟劉慶一等十人爲代表，於今日上午十時，應吳市長之召，赴市府晋謁，俾便面陳一切云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據悉：中信局本週人造絲之配價，經該局於上週六召集各主管處人員會商一過，業已參照上週市况，決定每箱爲二千二百卅萬元云。</p>
<h3>中信局舉辦　食油增產貸欵　包括大豆芝蔴菜籽四類</h3>
<p>中信局爲謀推動食汕增產，以配合總動員令方案，已根據四聯總處，於上屆理事會中通過實物貸款方式，於上週問召集有關行局，及榨油業等機關，作初步交換意見後，咸認四聯總處原則旣定，實施細則當可依之推尋、應迅速擬訂辦理，由該局與第三區植物汕鍊製業共同商訂，定於週二（十二日）將全部決定發表。此次食油增產貸款，包括大豆·花生·芝蔴，菜籽，四類原料，於收購工作進行上，作統籌辦理，並將兼及製成品之儲運工作，故於今後國內生產消費上裨益甚鉅。</p>
<p>增加產量</p>
<p>最近數日，本市食油供應情形，以種種原因，漲風迭起，現中植汕廠己自靑島遝滬豆汕三〇〇〇桶，正待估值，以便拋售。該廠並奉經濟部令，每月增產食汕二萬担，至中信局於上月間　交榨油業各廠二三〇〇噸大豆，以代製方式榨製完畢。上週又在滬起卸大豆三七〇〇噸，擬趁合約簽訂後，委由各廢代製，通前次合併共爲六〇〇〇噸，手續費或可較上次每担二萬元增加百分之五十。</p>
<p>原料豐收</p>
<p>本年榨油原料，各方估計可下豐收，故中信局目前正審計國內各類榨油原料之產量，於顧及本國需要之外，備作定量輸出。頃據榨油業有資　人士之估計，客歲東北大豆產量達一二二，六〇〇，〇〇〇斛，關內各地共計一六六，六〇〇，〇〇〇斛，本年各地除因戰事殃及遭受損失外，皆可擬收。</p>
<p>出口困難</p>
<p>東九省商人，曾載貨數批，分別運往歐洲各國及蘇聯，惟以伙國政治局勢不靖，交通困難，大豆產銷，未能恢復正軌，故銷僑數量爲額不多。目前伙國出；業，仍欲恢復戰前正常狀態，困難重重。據一般估計，我國年內在國軍控制區內之大豆輸出量，恐不致超過七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇至八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸以上，即使東九省恢復全面和平後，我國關內對大豆需要甚切，輸往國外數量，除非產量有顯著的增加，否則亦不致選到戰前的水準云。</p>
<h3>大批黃金運澳門　在馬尼刺截獲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺十日電〕據聞菲律濱財政部偵緝人員，昨日阻止黃金二萬五千盎斯（值一百二十七萬九千美元），自馬尼刺用飛機運往澳門。此間各出口商雖握外國資令管理局之黃金出口許可證，但菲國財長高特諾宣布，此種許可證已於七月十八日失效。各商行請求延長黃金出口許可證，均被高氏拒絕，以服從國際貨幣基金團之規定，即黃金賣買不得高於每盎斯三十五美元。</p>
<p>目前澳門金價每盎斯在五十一美元以上，故走私者趨之若驚。黃金自澳門流入中國黑市。菲內閣最近會議，討論黃金問題，高特諾重申菲國在國際貨幣協定下之義務。總統秘書亞倍羅稱，菲國正在華盛頓調查美國財長史尼特最近聲明之用意，史氏曾謂美國並不反對加革大入口之黃金再度出口以供提煉云。</p>
<h3>柴油業函全經　請寬放柴油限額</h3>
<p>輸管會第三期限額中因柴油實感缺乏，故限額獨增加七十餘萬元美金，以求柴油能普遍供應，黑市不致再生。過去民營工業所需柴汕，尙可向各汕公司設法採購，而近數月來，因來源减少，各汕公司拒絕出售，民營工業爲維持生存計，不得不求諸黑市，而黑市價格較限價竟高出四倍餘，政府原允許第三期限額中增加七十餘餘萬美金。增加數字過少，現柴汕業己函全國經濟委員會，請求寬放增加。</p>
<h3>製造衛生材料用品　技術上已無問題　外貨競爭入口似應予禁止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處統計：衛生材料之製品，大別之有橡皮膚藥棉紗布綢帶等種。吾國十年前大都仰給舶來品，民國廿四年信誼　廠創之橡皮膏廠，民國廿六年新亞衛生材料廠成立專製星牌據皮膏，以上兩廠每月各產一五〇〇〇卷，（每卷十二時五碼）以上，民國廿八年新亞復擴充範圍，增添織布脫脂漂白設備，製造脫脂紗布藥棉綢帶等。其他有天平大通惠生新華快樂等廠，製造藥棉紗布。抗戰期間，後方衡生材料之供應，多由本市轉一遍香港滇　路及浙東運入內地，勝利以來，因美貨救濟品剩餘物資等衛生材料大量來華，該業因製造成本較大，無法競爭，以致營業大受影響。</p>
<p>目前製造橡皮膏者，計有信誼新亞天平諸華廠。製造紗布者，則有新　大通惠生等廠。製造藥棉者，則有大通惠生新亞新華快樂等廠家。除藥棉之外，橡皮膏紗布之現在產量距最大產量甚遠，少者　二三成。補導處認爲術生材料之製造，技術上已無問題，且設備簡單，如有需要時，極易增產。國內旣能充分供應，外貨之入口似應予禁止。</p>
<h3>國行派兩稽核　監核巴川正和淸理</h3>
<p>昨據國行某負責人稱：本市巴川正和兩分行停止交換後，財政部已依據金融管制辦怯，吊銷該兩行營業執照。同時幷由財部電囑國行稽核處，監督該兩行淸理。國行奉令後，已於十日派定沈俞兩稽核，分赴以上兩行，辦理淸理事宜。</p>
<p>關於兩行負責總額，共的一百五十億元，包括普通在款，及同業拆放在內。共淸理程序，將先撥還督通存款，然後淸理同業拆放，預計此項工作，可於兩月以內竣事。</p>
<p>又稱：該兩行之上海以外總分行，則仍照常繼續營業，近來上海銀根鬆動，該兩行淸理，對本市市面，幷無影響云。</p>
<h3>國藥疲挫</h3>
<p>市况，多數疲乏不振，惟川幣。津幣各貨尙堅，洋廣貨一度爲匪水關係。而吿上漲，廣本香，到過十二萬元。而漢口與上海相較，幾乎相差一半，於是向漢”去辦。本埠藥店，門市冷落，以致銷路更形缺乏，而廣木香今已跌進十萬元大關，甚至叫八萬元，印木香亦被帶小。泰昌　，銷令將過，跌至二萬八千元。砂米跌至三萬二千元·而成交極少，人心極虛。</p>
<h3>港橡膠貿易</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十日電〕港橡膠貿易空前逢勃，上半年輸入生　二四一，三〇〇擔，輸出一五九，八〇〇撥，入口橡膠來自馬來亞及荷屬，出口方面，除運美五千擔外，其餘十五萬擔則運往我國。</p>
<h3>我國亟應開拓　絲織品南美市塲　大可取日本原有地位而代之</h3>
<p>戰後美國，已成為世界產絲國家競爭市塲，而日絲運美，存底頗豐，美國尼龍產量驚人，在在均足爲中國生絲外銷勁敵，致造成生絲在美供過於求市價慘跌諸現象，伙國蠶絲界對此問題極爲注意。蓋今春生絲，預計將由政府收鱗，可達一四·〇〇〇關擔，而秋蠶又發種催靑在即，如許物資將來抑作外銷打算，或計劃製成　　，再行輸出，蠶絲產銷協導委員會，及絲織品外銷協導委會，均會預計及此，而謀妥善政策。</p>
<p>茲悉：關係方面近會接南美洲絲業界有資格人士方面報吿，略稱：該地市塲中華人士，對此太爲疏忽，其原因以路途遙遠，一向缺少直接聯繫，經常訂貨，均由美國轉遞郵包，非二三月不可，船運更非數月不達。然若謀擴廣國貨發展，仍有不少良好機會；其理由為（一）南美諸邦在第二次世界大戰時，幷未受遭遇損失，反之且因戰時貿易增進，吸收之外匯甚歷，購買力增强。（二）戰前日貨在該地傾銷，獲有相當地位，現時喜用日貨心理，幷未完全消滅。尤以絲减品及謁緞爲甚，在此英國生絲銷路不振時期，大可改弦易轍，另關門徑，將生絲製成品，向該地傾銷，以代替日本原有地位。</p>
<p>根據上列因素，我國人士未免疏忽，致目前積極向該地拓展市塲，反操諸英·法義諸商人之手。其推銷方怯，甚至以中國貨字樣號召，或稱日本貨混淆，甚少直稱歐洲出品。雖銷路未盡合理想，但其市塲引人重視，由此可知。</p>
<p>該方人士之報吿，幷建議改良方怯，促使伙國速向南美洲組織考察團，携帶成品，除主要絲織綢緞外，並携瓷器，漆器，繼花品，等前往，以喚起該處人士注意，而恢復愛好中華貨物之興趨。此外不妨仿效義大利，向該地推銷綢緞方式，即心成品　去，以作展覽，結果該貨完全銷傾，且可免去進口稅云。</p>
<h3>棉織品二百餘種　明日運銷南洋</h3>
<p>中國棉織業產銷聯營全司，爲積極推廣南洋貿易十起見，特於前晚召開重要聯席會議，討論關於對南洋轍出問題。當議決：（一）經巳審查合格可以外銷之各種出品，計二百六十八種，先將每種提出若干打，定明日（十二）由該公司自行裝運一批前往南洋各地。（二）派陳有軍代表該公司，即赴南洋接治推銷事宜。（三）向政府有關機關，請求連撥原料與貸款，俾該公司所屬各廠，能早日從事生產外銷之成品。</p>
<p>又悉：南洋各地華僑進口商，聞該公司成立後，紛紛函電　洽。最近該處擬先後派遣代表來滬，正式與該公司洽商訂貨。幷悉：菲列濱進口商會代表主席，不日將來滬云。</p>
<h3>收購三批菜籽　預估一百億元</h3>
<p>中央信託局對江浙皖採購菜籽，增加菜油生產，其第一第二批陸續到滬者，裁至九日止，共約十萬擔，包括平湖區約三萬擔，蕪湖二萬五千擔，蘇州四萬擔、全額總計約共二百五十億元。該局爲代政府把握多量民食必需日用品計，除向以上三區繼續採購賸餘菜籽外，並將朱家角列入收購區，預計第三批採勝總金額約一百億元。該項工作究成後，對採購事宜將暫吿一段落云。</p>
<h3>受茶銷停滯影響　福州花茶陷絕境</h3>
<p>〔中央社福州八日電〕一福州名產花茶，現正值產製之時，但因最近茶銷停滯，茶商無意培製，賴以生活之十餘萬茶農花農及茶工，均陷絕境。</p>
<p>按福州花茶，戰前每年有大量輸出，銷售東北華北各省，佔全國內銷茶業之首位。據統計，民廿二年福州輸出花茶總額達十四萬餘損，價値六千餘萬地，戰時產銷低落，花農咸除花株，改種糧食，茶廠商紛紛倒閉，昔日花白如雪，數里聞香，及「茶號林立運舟如織」之盛况，已成歷史陳跡。</p>
<p>勝利後，花茶市塲復見活躍，去年各茶號又相趕製，圖博厚利，惟去年度各種香花，總產量僅七千餘担，競購結果，花價飛漲，故花茶成本突增。另因華北共匪作亂影響，銷路遂吿停滯。</p>
<p>據調查，福州以香花蕭製茶葉，乃近百年事。初有長樂人，自廣州携帶茉莉花種回鄉栽植，以其花色淸白，香味濃郁，專供觀賣及婦女裝飾。</p>
<p>至淸咸豐年間，有北平汪正大商號運鼻烟至長樂，發現首茉莉花　後香味甚佳，長樂帮茶商，乃以茉莉花葉茶，銷路大增。古田帮茶商，繼之效怯，花茶製造業，乃日盛，致香花供不應求。福州各鄕農民，見其有利，亦紛紛栽種，更因福州交通便利，貿易發達，茶號逐漸集中，由是成爲花茶之主要產地。</p>
<p>嗣後茶號復自行採用各種香花，試薰茶葉，經認定柚花，珠蘭，木蘭，玉蘭，水梔，玳瑁等，均可薰製，惟用首茉莉珠蘭黨製者，售價較優。　茶分「　」與「提」兩種，「　」係節去殘花後，加焙烘，「提」則節去後不加烘焙，　之次數愈多，則花香深入茶中，泡水後，香味芬芳撲鼻，沁人肺腑。</p>
<h3>杭市茶業衰落　茶行數家已停業</h3>
<p>〔本報九日杭州訊〕杭今庚茶市因銷化軟弱，重利難負，且貨物稅迭次加重，殊乏進展，本市因營業清稀，申報停業者，己有聯裴茶行·德大鑫茶行·同泰祥杭州分公司·翁啓泰茶行·吳永泰茶莊等數家。</p>
<h3>國庫局遷京</h3>

<h3>馬褲呢開價平</h3>
<p>呢羢門市零銷及定製衣着，昨仍形淸談，客帮則頗有蠕動之態·董　貨紛紛　令，秋冬貨已相　上市。眞實呢及嗶　，自上週四川長沙西安帮採辦後、行情好起不少，昨市依然堅挺。馬褲呢及駝斯錦，近茶會上亦皆互有談判，而其開價遠較眞實呢爲便宜。（按通去馬褲呢無價與　　相並，有時且超過之。）寄碼喊沽不到五十萬元，究其原因，係受麥爾登大衣單袍之風行，致馬褲呢駝斯錦大衣。實銷銳减。</p>
<h3>行政院正式公佈　營業稅法施行細則</h3>
<p>行政院正式公佈營業稅法實行細則共三十一條、負責征收營業稅之機關爲市政府及縣政府，凡政府機關與人民合辦之商業機構，亦須同樣繳納，征收期限規定爲每年三　底六月底九月底及十二月底四次。茲誌其全文如次。</p>

<h3>中國現代女作家小說專輯　「無題集」序</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>嚴格地講，中國現代眞正在文藝上有建樹有成就的作家，就不多，而女作家更是鳳毛鱗角！如果以數目字來計算，「五四」迄今，不過三數十位，然尙有不少巳輟筆者。論文章，各有千秋，在中國文項上是都有其輝煌歷史的。這些女作家，於中國新文藝思潮演變的階段裏，也都有着劃時代的表現。我們可以簡略地分期列舉一下：「五四」前後，女作家極爲踴躍，如冰心·　昌英·馮沅君·蘇雪林·黃臚隱·陳衡哲·林徵音。凌淑華。方令孺·睦晶淸·陸小曼。沉櫻等，均爲當時反對建的新典文藝大將。「九一八」前後前進女作家丁玲·白薇·吳似鴻·景宋·謝冰瑩·蕭紅等勇敢地爲反帝國主義的革命文藝的鬥爭，煊赫一時。到了「七七」前後，安娥·鳳子·王瑩·白朗·草明·葛琴·羅洪·楊絳等，熱烈地參加了民族抗戰的國防文藝。自然，這每一時代的女作家，（我只是憑記憶舉出這些女作家名字，遺漏或所不免，但絕非故意如此。）其表現並不僅限於那個時代，除了少數死亡和改行職筆齣以外，這些女作家還是跟着時代在繼續地貢獻着。</p>
<p>中國原是一切落後的國家，中國婦女界更是落後中的落後！由於中國婦女一向被肚會忽視的傳統觀念，女作家不能例外地也被忽視了。但根據上面簡略的統計，中國現代女作家人數上雖少，寫作精神上並不稍遜於男作家，所以是值得我們頌揚的。爲了中國文壇忽視女作家的表現·甚而存在的原故，因此關於女作家的作品，歷來很少有系統的介紹與蒐集。偶而有些選集和評論一類的書籍出版，也都顯得不夠完善，嚴正客觀。晨光圖書公司鑒於此點，覺得從「五四」到抗戰勝利的今日，似乎已吿一大段落，應該把這不算短的近三十年來新舊女作家的最新作品，比較有系統地蒐集起來，使讀者可以從這些作品裏面，窺見她們隨着文藝思潮演變的進步與趨勢！於是委托了我來編緝這本集子。</p>
<p>然而，值今中國政治經濟混亂，造成了社會的不安定，文化的荒蕪。特別是文藝！文藝作家受着物質精神的變層壓迫，寫不出好文章，也更談不上從事文藝復興的活動。因此，文藝凋零，是所必然；實爲近三十年來所未有。所以，在這期間，辦一個文藝刋物已經困難，而欲辦一個較專門性的文藝刋物，則允其困難！</p>
<p>記得家璧先生（本書發行者）最初，和我談起擬出版「中國現代女作家小說專輯」的時候，還遠在今年的春二月。爲了和家璧的友誼；爲了這件工作的歷史意義？雖明知其艱巨，仍勉力承當。苜先，僅聯絡谷女作家，就費了九牛二虎之力，因爲她們都散居在國內外各地。通訊網建立以後，便分頭約稿，指定請她們每人爲這集子十寫一篇小說。幸而承她們都很友情地應允了，（少數因病或因事忙未及交卷。）但集稿却化了幾個月的時間。儘管如此，這集子終竟是編成了。</p>
<p>講到這集子的內容，用不着我來多所贅述，讀者自有公論。不過我需要吿訴讀者的，這集子裏面的每篇文章都是非常珍貴的。冰心女士多年不創作小說了，這次從日本返國，又赴日本，不顧旅途勞頓，不避溽暑炎熱，揮汗爲撰「無題」，其文筆幹練，意境卓越，誠屬難得之作。馮沅君女士二十載未嘗寫小說，今破例寫「倒下了這一個互人」，雖短而精，雖簡而工！寰昌英女士亦久未著小銳，近抱病完成了「牛」，蘇雪林女士在百忙中寫「黃山齊在金陵獄」，二人之文字均較綺麗，技巧也極純熟，究竟不愧出自前輩之手。陳小曼女士輟寫廿年，近特爲執筆「女兒刼」，描繪生動，且細膩。陸晶淸女士自英倫寄來異國情調的「河邊公寓」，王瑩女士自紐約寄來追溯往事的「別後」，以及沈櫻女士的倫理之作「洋娃娃」，都是近年來讀者所不易見到的傑作；因爲她們三位也已經很久很久沒有執過筆了。此外冰瑩女士的「離婚」，鳳子女士的「連像」，羅洪女士的「劊子手」，篇篇均爲力作，且皆有獨到之處！至於我自己的〔落葉無限愁」，叨陪末座，不過充塞篇幅而已，不敢妄稱作家，但願追隨各位先進，學習不懈，待小成於來日耳。</p>
<p>為了尙欲繼續編成散文，詩歌，戲劇各築，所以此次所約女作家並不普遍。同時，在這集子裏已經寫過的女作家，下次依然還要請她們參加。譬如謝冰心女士·馮沅君女士、蘇雪林女士，陸晶淸女土等能寫小說也能寫詩，在詩歌集內就少不了她們。袁昌英女士，王瑩女士等能寫小說也能寫戲劇。在戲劇集內就少不了她們·沈櫻女士·冰瑩女士·陸小受女士。鳳子女士。羅洪女士等能寫小說也能寫散文，在散文集內就少不了她們。總之，伙是希望全體女作家們來共同完成這四本篆子。只是由於交通關係，像丁玲女士的作品這次便無法得到，這實在是一個很大的遺憾，不過以後我還是要進行試試看。</p>
<p>關於這集子的編輯方式，依百光圖書公司的意思，仿照歐英出版家作風，每篇作品之前附印作者照片與手迹，這樣作或不無有人要妄加毀謗，其實，不過是爲了加强勝史價值，和給予讀者以較深刻的印象罷了。而且還附戰每位作者的小傳，此乃便於讀者對於每位女作家的研究，如果有人硬要誤解爲招搖關騙，那也只好隨他去了。反正我是問心無愧的。</p>
<p>最後，感謝爲這集子撰稿的諸位好友！祝你們永遠筆健，永遠爲中國開放出最燦爛的文藝之花！（卅六年八月一日夜深於海上）（附註：無題集晨光圖書公司印行，九月出版）</p>
<h3>舊詞新話</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>王靜安先生云：「社會之習慣，殺許多善人；文學上之習慣，殺許多天才。』，此語雖覺大胆，然仔細思量，頗帶幾分甘苦自知的辛酸味。人類是一種服從習慣的動物，此魯迅先生所謂『連搬桌綺板櫈都要流血』之意。這移用在文學創作上，就是拘泥——泥古與泥今，同樣是服從於旣成的法則。</p>
<p>柳書卿詞，因爲多用俚語，便被當時的文人輕視，其輕視的結果，刦不能抹煞『有井水處皆歌柳詞」，於是連執當時文壇牛耳的蘇學士也不禁問門客：『我詞何如柳七？』</p>
<p>然而，眞正的天才是不會被壓殺的，「楊柳岸曉風殘月」不只流傳，而且是北宋詞人　運用白話的中流砥柱。</p>
<p>「時髦」也許是好的，但是別犯上趨時的毛病，標新立異雖然有時顯得孤鄙，可是比起與世浮沉的文學家來，仍然有點可愛。</p>
<p>蘇學士的門客說得好：「柳詞宣十七八女郎，紅牙板，唱「楊柳岸曉風殘月」；學士詞宜關西大漢，銅琶鐵板，唱「大江東去」！』，正說明蘇自爲蘇，柳自為柳，不必劃一格式，「非我族類，其心必異」也。</p>
<p>所以，天才不但能利用形式，改造形式，而且可以突破形式的枷鎖；庸才則反是。</p>
<p>元遺山論詩絕句曰：「池塘春草謝家專，萬古千秋五字新；傳語閉門陳正字，可憐無補費精神。』，靜安先生謂『夢窗玉田輩，當不樂此語」，以此占之，南宋詞固遜於北宋，雖格調殊懸，而手眼亦覺塵下，天下畫仕女者甚多，然只費曉棋，仇十洲聲名藉甚，不在功力而要皆在乎神悟。小謝『澄江靜如練』為千古絕唱，雖太白續之為『愛道澄江靜如練，令人長憶謝玄暉」反成狗尾；朱慶餘之『妝罷低聲問夫婿，畫眉深淺入時無，』，女兒情態躍然紙上，然歐陽永叔易爲「………去來窗下笑相扶，愛道畫眉深淺入時無。』便覺故意　作。太白永叔，詩詞燿煉千古，偶一趨步，也成東施。</p>
<p>新詩中亦有此感覺，巴爾芒詩：</p>
<p>『我之所以活着，</p>
<p>就是為了愛太陽——』</p>
<p>效顰者多如過江這　，然無一不令人感覺遜色，其理亦在此</p>
<p>白石夢窗詞過於雕飾，便易失其自然之美，其「暗香」，「疎影」二開，實爲林和靖『疎影橫斜水淸淺，暗香浮動月昏黃。』之衍義而已，作詞發中作畫，『疏處能馳馬，密處不能插針。」，和靖詩已密不容針，雖懸諸國門求易一字不可，邊論舖陳細道？</p>
<p>余生平最愛東塗西抹，惟至采石磯靑蓮墓不留一字，何故？有感於『來的去的寫兩行，魯班門前掉大斧』也；退之讚靑運工部有「靑蜓石柱」之議，若寫下來豈不成爲「孫行者到此一遊』？最多也不過在別人掌心裏留下點騷氣而已，這又何苦？</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭的約翰·克利斯朶夫第一卷裏，約翰的祖父爲一不知名的音樂家，他在一生落魄之際，忽然得到一個音樂天才的孫兒，其樂可知，然仍不免偸偸地在約翰的樂意裏添上了一個音符，認爲裏面也有了自己的心血而暗自欣慰。寫文章不除這種心理，將永無自已。</p>
<p>靑運登黃鶴樓，見崔灝「昔人已乘黃鶴去』句，大為歎賞，終日「眼前有景道不得，崔灝題詩在上頭。』。自知之明必須要有，一味矜誇，便是吳白菜爛豆芽秀才。</p>
<p>近人詩多寫「贈友」，「遊記」，惟不能推陳出新獨具己見，只知帮凑成詠，直是在自家臉上畫花鼻子，愈顯其醜態；「落月滿屋梁，猶疑照顏色。』，情深語摯，千古絕響；『氣蒸雲夢澤，波撼岳陽城。』，洞庭千里盡入筆下；……言念及此，不如放下禿筆，多讀讀古人詩，直到眞有話想說時，再如黃正則之：「我手寫我口，彼豈能拘牽……」，雖不入高人雅土之眼，何妨學學板橋寫兩首道情，自吟自賞？</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　369</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「這兒，　哪！……糧羣和小老虎路進了旅舍，正往裏走着，忽地聽得招　的人，在身後這一麼喊着。</p>
<p>二人一回頭，看見招待站在大門內一間屋子門口，直挺挺地，表示二人應當先上道間屋子裏去。這是新漆的花色。耀羣沒有知道，也只得邀着小老虎，返身回走。</p>
<p>「旅客御註册處」，壓子門上縣着一塊小木牌，牌上漆着這幾個字。</p>
<p>「哪裏來的？」一個戴着眼鏡乾　騷的老傢伙，坐在一張案桌後面，端着審問囚犯的神氣，瞧著耀羣和小老虎，語音有些日本腔調。案桌上放着一大疊印成表册一類的簿十。看樣十每一册頁上有許多項目，必須塡　，要是每一册每一買每一項這們問着，這麼塡寫下去，至少也得好幾十分鐘。</p>
<p>就算龍羣耐性好，也明瞭情形　　，也知道這是在鐵蹄踐踏下生活着的一種方式；但是經過三十多小時慢車的　播，一直在緊張的低氣壓下支持着，這時認爲已經到了可以暫時喘息的站頭，却不料忽然又來了這麼陰森森地一套，縱令她想再委屈些，忍受下去，恐怕那過分緊張的心情，也不由得要發生抗拒的反應了。</p>
<p>整個的小老虎蘭直可說是一隻猛烈炸彈的化身。沿路，在這三十多小時的行程上，眼見的，耳總的，有許多形形色色的刺戟性撞擊，可以觸發他的爆炸性，可是都給繼羣控制着，把他的爆炸程度健量的减低；他本人自己，也有一個甜美的幻想，和一個秘密使命的高壓，帮他控制着自己的火性。但這眼）面前這一個鐘頭，確然有些一叫他君嚥不下去。</p>
<p>這時這隻猛烈性的炸彈，似乎已經受了最大的撞擊，已經到了爆裂的尖頂了。假設這時耀羣對準那個發問的老傢伙一瞪眼，或是一聲冷笑，或是發出一種隨便什麼抵抗性的小動作，毫無疑問，小老虎必是一躍而前……</p>
<p>可是這一躍而前的後果如何呢？耀羣和小老虎憑着他們的機智和勇武，也許可能一走了之；可以連夜趕到老寨，却要曉得這時的瀋陽，是倭軍的第二大後防，「遠征軍」的大本營，妖魔邪氣，都籠縮在這一國之中，勢必有一個嚴密週到的禁衛佈置；表面雖則冷靜，然而愈是冷靜，潛伏的機構，愈是險惡可怕。</p>
<p>就算耀羣小老虎能夠脫身，這家旅舍也是不了。那個老傢伙，在這旅舍裏辦情旅客註册的事，不過是總機構上齣一根觸鬚，如要動了這根觸　，整個佈置，自然牽動；這家旅舍，是個出事的中心，就說運這兩個旅客，連姓名都不曾知道，這出事的地點，按日寇素常的陰險橫蠻個性來說，勢必遭到牽連。那封鎖，搜查，誣坐，嫌疑，等等無理性的動作，勢必要一步一步，逐步演出。隨便統計一下，這旅會的職司，速那亳不相干的旅客在內，至少也有幾十人，要遭到無妄的飛災。正應了俗語說的「城門失火，殃及池魚。」</p>

<h3>科學家該說話了！</h3>
<p>— 劉咸</p>
<p>這次杜魯門總統派特使魏德邁將軍來華考察，下車伊始，即發表談話，說此來任務，是採訪事實，蒐集材料，徵詢意見，以便携　華府，作爲美國重定對華，甚或遠東。政策的參考。旬餘以來，魏將軍一行，不辭跋涉將歷訪京，滬，平，瀋，臂，漢，渝，粵，台灣等地，與吾國朝野各界接觸頻繁·據稱已獲得許多珍貴報導和資料，而吾國工商金融各界，和政府各部門，均先後提供有關政治，外交，軍事，交通，經濟各種報吿，各黨各派，亦發表了一些改善政治的意見魏氏周諮博訪，不厭求詳，虛心聽取，不　己見，務使大衆意見，眞正輿論，無保留的提出，無顧忌的發揮，這是很開明的做法，很民主的表現。</p>
<p>在這各方面紛紛提供意見的時候，我們所引爲遺憾的，就是直到現在，還不曾聽到科學界的呼聲，還不曾見到有炎橋的科學家發表一些有關科學的意見。我們不是希望美國援助嗎？難道說我們這些支離被碎，貧乏萎弱的科學事萊，不正是需要實際的幫助嗎？再說到國計民生的改善，建國大業的推進，那一門少得了科學？現在美國旣有援助中國復興的計劃，科學當然要佔重要的部分。况且美國是一個科學很發達的國家，人人都知道科學的重要，我們科學界的意見，定能獲得美國人的重視。我們應該實事求是，斟酌國情，趁着這個良好的機會，提供一些中國建設科學的意見和計劃，以作魏將軍的參老，時不我待，稍縱即逝，我以爲全國科學機關，科學團體，以及科學家個人，都該說話了！</p>
<h3>測騐說謊的科學方法</h3>
<p>— 梁木</p>
<p>近年來科學家發明了幾種測騐說謊的機器，試騐的成績，很是驚人。關於各種機器，報章雜誌多有登載，外國機器商行，多有出售，且不說他。現在讓伙們談一談關於這個問題的一些有趣的故事。</p>
<p>古代野聲人，就知道用謊話騙人。但是那時候還沒有好的方法來測驗一個人所說的話是不是謊話。除了不慣於騙人的人，當所說的話被人家發覺了話不對題的時候，會面紅耳赤，張口結舌，手足無措言語支離，這樣人們就立刻看出他是說謊了。若習慣說謊善於騙人的人，不但面不改色，而且還能自圓其說，使人更加相信，不知道受騙。平常人說謊話的時候，就令能面不改色，身體的內部却也起很多的變化，如同血液循環的加念，因而面紅耳赤，呼吸急迫，還有口中發乾等等現象。所以中國古代審判罪犯，有一種特別的方法，就是問話的時候，使這個罪犯嚼一口米飯，然後叫他吐出來，看看是不是比平常要乾些。若是比平常乾些，就證明他說的話是謊話，一定是犯了罪。還有一種迷信的人，他說了謊話不承認的時候，若叫他對天，對燈，或對廟裏的隅偶發誓，他必驚慌失色，現出不敢發誓的樣子，道就可以證明他是說謊騙人了。</p>
<p>古來人對於測騐說謊，還有用心理方法的。關於心理方法，有一個很有趣的故事。這個故事，就是有一個印度王子，他用一種很聰明的方法，從好多嫌疑犯裏找出眞正的罪犯來。他的方法是把這些嫌疑犯都關在一個屋子裏，叫他們面向着牆立着，把手放在背後，然後吿訴他們說隔壁房間裏有一匹神驢，犯了罪的人若是把他的尾巴一拉，他就會大呌起來。犯罪的人挨着次序每個人都去把驢的尾巴拉一把，然後回到原來的地位，背着手立着。結果每個人都拉過了驢尾巴，而這個驢子並沒有呌。這個王子就過來呌他們每個人把手都伸出來。他一看立刻就知道那一個是眞正的罪犯。原來呌他們去拉驢尾巴的時候，這個印度王子把這個驢子的尾巴上抹了一些黑顏色，沒有犯罪的人每人都拉得兩手漆黑，惟有那眞正的罪犯手上一點黑色也沒有。原來這是他的心理作用。他知道自己犯了罪，怕一拉驢尾巴，那驢便呌起來，而被王子知道他是罪犯，所以他不敢去拉·那個印度王子就是利用這種心理，和他們的迷信，把這個罪犯測騐出來了。</p>
<p>古時的人頭腦簡單，迷信鬼神，可以用心理或迷信的方法來測騐他們。現在的人旣不迷信而又有機智，這種方法就不　了所以近來科學家研究如何利用科學方法來測騐說謊，發明了幾種機器，試騐齣成績很不懷。如果這種機器測騐的時候，萬無一失，而能普遍採用，未必不是司法界審判罪犯的一種很大的貢獻。關於測騐說謊的機器，在歐洲從二三百年以前，就有人研究過，不過近幾十年來才有科學的機器和算得住的試騐。</p>
<p>在一九二二年美國哈佛大學，心理學試驗室馬斯敦氏（William　Moutom　Marton）開始研究。他做了好多回的試騐，結果，無論什麼人在說謊的時候，他身體上都發生變化，最顯著的就是血壓增高。一九一四年在奧國格來茲（Graz）地方有本　西（Vittorio　Bennussie）氏，發明了一種測騐說謊的方法。他所根據的原理，是一個人說謊的時候，他的呼吸必然加快，這種的加快可以很準確的量出來。三年後玻耳提氏（Harold　Burtt）在哈佛大學的試騐室中，又把本鈕西的方法改進了。一九二一年拉森博士（Dr．John　Lasson）在美國加利福尼亞和著名的罪犯學家，弗而莫氏（August　Vollnies）合作研究，發明了一種測騐說謊的機器叫做Erlanger　Spygmomanometer並且試騐過很多罪犯，和嫌疑犯，試驗的結果亦很準確。在一九二五年司丹佛大學紀勒耳的，（L．Keeler）發明了一架機器叫做Polygraph。紀勒耳在一九三〇年作了美國西北大學罪犯學的敎授，爲世界著名的罪犯學家了。這機器，也是測騐一個人說謊話的時候，的血壓和呼吸的變化。到現在這種機器已經很普遍被人採用了。現在同類機器當中若用的得當，成績最可靠的，就是這種機器了。（一）</p>

<h3>猛烈的液體炸藥</h3>
<p>— 白吿</p>
<p>雖然在這原子時代有了原子炸彈以後，還須要什麼其他的炸藥呢？可是並不原子炸彈到底那有幾國能製造，這是一個疑。所以筆者這襄所講的液體炸藥，也是一個新奇的知識。</p>
<p>美國巴羅（LesterP.Barlow）和他的同事霍爾得勒（R.G.Holderer）發明了一種液體軍碳炸藥，這種炸藥是有一種叫做「各來埋土」（Glimite）的新式液體碳氣炸藥，其毀滅力實堪驚人，能使一個以爆發點爲中心，而以一千呎爲半徑的圓區內，所有人物和畜牲同歸於盡·</p>
<p>我們曾經請來了幾位新聞記者，參觀這種炸藥製炸彈在擲出後所發生的結果。他們爲證明這種炸彈不受火和震動的影饗起見，曾將炸彈燃燒，將槍彈射入炸彈·更將它們從一種迫擊砲中，射至五百英尺的空中，並且使之衝擊着一張鋼板上，又　跳三百呎，結果均不發生爆炸，據巴羅君說，這種爆炸物係將碳和其他秘物質吸收於液態氣中而成，它的炸力非至飽和後隔卅小時決不退化。液態氣炸藥已應用多時，但是這種液體氣碳炸藥因非常猛烈的壓力之故，具有一種更大的毀滅本領。這種炸藥更有一個優點。即製費低廉。據說每磅僅需美元四元半。</p>
<h3>戰時蘇聯地理學者之總動員</h3>

<p>蘇聯地理硏究所對于此一新區域之硏究，着重于工業開發，交通建設與都市設計三項要點。阿拉木圖原爲中亞草原之村落，今已建設成爲哈薩克共和國之百府，其地即爲蘇聯與新疆國際交通之聯運站，實中亞細亞之一新國際接觸都市。</p>
<p>一九四一年以前，哈薩克之地理，爲地球上是少記述之區域，而今要爲世界區域地理研究最縝密之地理單位。不但其地之地理研究爲學術上之新猷，在科學應用方面，創立「區城設計」　工作，尤爲地理研究方法上最高之成就。一九四三年十一月哈匯克共和國舉行二十五週年紀念會時，蘇聯地理研究所特展覽其學術成績之一部分，哈薩克共和國之經營規模，與其苜府阿拉木圖新都市之建立，立即表現實際事業之成就，地理研究工作，爲近代區城設計之　矢，發人深省。</p>
<p>中亞細亞之地理研究，除哈薩克外，更從事於其昆連區域之調查·如南之吉爾吉斯北部，北之鄂木斯克，車里亞賓斯克，吉爾干·同時對于阿爾泰山區及汾甘納低地·亦均有貢獻。圖可門共和國境內之地理，則由莫斯科大學之經濟地理學系負責研究，三年來與蘇聯科學院之地理研究所配合分工，成績亦斐然可觀。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰未爆發前，蘇聯地理研究所即己從事內流窪地之研究工作，曾設法利用裏海之水力以灌注於其旁之喀喇吉斯低地，並開發其地之鐵礦及硫化物資源。一九四三年以後戰局好轉，蘇聯地理研究所之中心工作，乃轉而注重頓內次盆地及莫斯科附近中央工業區之復興工作。</p>
<p>蘇聯地理學家之辛勤貢獻，戰時裨益于戰略戰術方面便利良多，遂極爲軍事當局所重視，乃正式成立軍事地理研究會，常以專門軍事間題，邀請地理學家共同商討，發表意見，時派軍事專家參加新區域之地理考察工作，並於全國各級重事學校設立地理學講座，普及軍事地理教育，其重硯戰時地理學研究之成就，可以想見。</p>
<p>凡上所述，因尙未盡蘇聯地理學家戰時之全部工作，如參加極地之地理研究，亦致力良多。勝利以後，由戰時工作轉入平時工作，蘇聯地理學方面，仍將從純粹科學之立塲，以研究自然地理與壓史地理上之問題，此乃最近蘇聯科學院地理研究所所長格里葛里夫之立論。（完）</p>

<h3>Wei's Envoy Calls on Chairman Chiang for Extensive Talks; Now Going to Taiwan to Gather Information; Will Come to Shanghai to Contact Sino-American Business Circles</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 10th] Wei Te-mai called on Chairman Chiang at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 10:00 AM on the 10th. This was the envoy's first meeting with the Chairman since returning to Nanjing from the north. They talked for four hours and had lunch together. The content of the talks is not known, but it is widely believed that the current situation and prospects in North China and the Northeast must have been one of the main topics. According to a member of the mission, Wei and his party were deeply impressed by the unfortunate situation in northern China. Wei himself also believes that if the North achieves stability and industrial construction has opportunities for development, China should not have serious economic problems. In the afternoon, Wei held a meeting with his advisors and discussed the information collected during their trip to North China and the Northeast. At 5:00 PM, Wei and the Minister went to the Lai San Xiu Hall of Jinling University for worship. The Minister wore a white suit, and Wei wore a navy blue jacket and white pants. They sat in the front right corner near the organ, silently participating in prayer, listening to the sermon, and singing hymns with the congregation. After the service ended at 6:00 PM, they laughed and talked as they boarded the car and left. In the evening, Wei went to No. 5 Ninghai Road again to dine with General Lucas, head of the US military advisory group. Wei and his party, except for Colonel He Qin, the secretary, who remained in Nanjing, will fly to Taiwan on the 11th for inspection, and are scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 13th to contact Sino-American business circles again. On the 15th, they will fly to Guangzhou, stay for one or two days, and then return to fully organize the information obtained in China in preparation for their report, before flying to Japan and then to Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Vice President Sun Ke recently stated that Special Envoy Wei is not entirely satisfied with the information he has obtained in China. In an exclusive interview with United Press reporter Mr. Jun Hobart, Sun said: Wei Te-mai found the situation in China to be worse than expected. The envoy also criticized some of the government's efforts to solve the current problems. Sun declined to reveal the confidential talks he had with the special envoy, but said that his personal feeling was that what Wei had obtained seemed to be "everything is not 100% on track." Sun added: "Of course, we also know this. Like the special envoy, we understand that China is facing many difficult problems. He is trying his best to collect as much information as possible so that he can make a judgment on the situation.</p>
<p>Sun said that after a long talk with Wei Te-mai, he believed that the special envoy had not yet made a decision on the future Chinese government. Sun believes that Wei's report to the United States in the future will have a great effect." Sun added: "In any case, the Communists are trying to expand and hold on, but the current government intends to strengthen its defense lines, as solid as gold." He pointed out that the Communist army may develop into a greater threat than it is now, and said: The Communist army is not up to the standard of a regular army. Sun believes that the Communist army sometimes uses terrorist tactics and forces unwilling people to fight. When asked by reporters if he had concrete evidence to prove the various points claimed by the Chinese side that the Soviet Union was aiding the Chinese Communists, Sun replied that Soviet ships were traveling between Dalian and Yantai, and they must have something to do. Their actions were definitely not for amusement.</p>
<p>Regarding Wei's trip to Taiwan, Sun said that it would be inappropriate to compare the high production of the Japanese before the war with the economy after the takeover. Sun believes that the Japanese should be held responsible for the decline in sugar production in Taiwan, because Japan converted sugarcane fields into rice paddies during the war to supply food to the three islands, and US air raids also destroyed some factories, and the land fertility has been exhausted and urgently needs fertilization. When the government took over Taiwan, it found the situation to be dire. It will take a long time for Taiwan to return to its original state in the future, but the government will do its best.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 10th] Luo Longji, a spokesman for the Democratic League, denied the newspaper reports that the Democratic League had submitted a memorandum to Envoy Wei requesting the United States to stop aid to China.</p>
<h3>To Safeguard the Completeness of Sovereignty Over Lushun and Dalian, We Are Considering Appropriate Measures; American Newspapers Criticize the Soviet Union's Exclusive Occupation of Dalian</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 10th] We are paying close attention to the United States' renewed protest against the Soviet military's forceful occupation of Datong. It is reported that the outside world hopes for the recovery of Lushun and Dalian, and is also considering taking further measures at an appropriate time to safeguard the completeness of our territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] Among all the newspapers here, only the New York World-Telegram of the Scripps-Howard chain and the American newspaper of the Hearst chain prominently published the news that the Soviet Union prohibited American ships from entering Dalian, and only the World-Telegram wrote a commentary criticizing the matter. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune both published the news on the inside pages. The New York Times' headline was "The United States Succumbs to the Soviet Union's Announced Ban in Dalian," and the New York Herald Tribune's headline was "American Ships Prohibited from Entering Dalian Owned by the Soviet Union." An editorial in the World-Telegram stated that the Soviet Union arbitrarily interpreted the Sino-Soviet Treaty and retained military control in Dalian until the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. If the Soviet Union refuses to sign a peace treaty with Japan based on this theory, it can continue to retain permanent control of the area. The World-Telegram also pointed out that in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union agreed to support the National Government led by Chairman Chiang, but the Soviet Union is now openly supporting the Chinese Communist Party, the enemy of the National Government, and is using Dalian as their operational base. The first to report the news that the Soviet Union prohibited American ships from entering Dalian was Scripps-Howard reporter Newton's Shanghai dispatch, which stated that unarmed American naval ships had been prohibited from entering Dalian since March of this year. The news was later confirmed by the US State Department, which is now considering submitting another stronger protest to the Soviet Union. According to the information released by the US military, this protest may be similar to the same note sent to Moscow and Nanjing in January of this year, but the wording will be stronger.</p>
<h3>Vice President Sun Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhang Junmai Leaves Shanghai for Guling</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Vice President Sun took the express train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our City News] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, took a boat to Xun from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th and transferred to Guling to escape the heat, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in half a month.</p>
<h3>Matters Related to Military Training in Taiwan Are Still in the Planning Stage</h3>
<p>The Army Military Academy Is Still Located in Chengdu</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] According to informed sources: Regarding the matters of military training in Taiwan by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, the US Army Advisory Group will participate as advisors, but this matter is still in the planning stage and must be approved by the governments of China and the United States. The Chinese side will be chaired by Sun Liren, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, so that the newly trained soldiers can become modernized divisions. However, according to reliable sources, Wei's trip to Taiwan has nothing to do with this matter and is considered not to be within the scope of his investigation. The US Army Advisory Group did not express its opinion on the military training plan.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 10th] According to the Military News Agency: The Central Army Military Academy has been taken over by the Army Headquarters, and the headquarters has sent personnel to discuss with the Fifth Department of the Ministry of National Defense. It is reported that the school will not be relocated for the time being and will still be run in Chengdu.</p>
<h3>Lei Zhen Talks About Sino-Japanese Trade</h3>
<p>Strict Control Will Not Be Unfavorable to Us</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Lei Zhen, a member of the Political Affairs Committee and Director of the East Asian Association, expressed his opinion yesterday on the issue of opening up Sino-Japanese trade, saying: "Under the current circumstances, we do not need to worry too much about restoring Sino-Japanese trade, because the government has decided to strictly control Sino-Japanese trade. If the imported Japanese goods are not needed by our country, it will be difficult to obtain an import permit. At the same time, the commodities exported to Japan will also consider whether we should export them, and whether the Japanese side needs to purchase them. As for the future mode of trade, its nature will be similar to "barter trade." Anyone who intends to purchase a certain quantity of Japanese goods must export national goods of equal value."</p>
<h3>Peng Xuepei Arrives in Xi'an</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 10th] Peng Xuepei of the Political Affairs Committee arrived in Xi'an from Lanzhou at 10:00 AM on the 10th. Peng will stay here briefly and then return to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 9th] Peng Xuepei of the Political Affairs Committee arrived at Lanzhou from Yongdeng at noon on the 9th. Peng said that although the Northwest is poor, it has a great future. The most important thing is political stability. We must work hard to suppress the rebellion, catch up quickly, and seek improvement. Then, he gave a general explanation of the situation in Xinjiang, saying that the current situation is not as serious as imagined. He remained silent on the Beitashan incident, only saying: After staying in Dihua for five days, he took a car to Beitashan for on-site inspection and stayed on the mountain for one day. The information obtained will be released after returning to Nanjing. Peng will return to the capital in the coming days, and the trip to Ningxia is said to have been cancelled.</p>
<h3>The National Boundary Markers in Manchuria and Mishan Were Forced to Be Moved Fifteen Li by the Soviets; Outer Mongolia's Statement Will Be Refuted by Us</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 10th] According to intelligence received by the military, the Sino-Soviet national boundary markers in Manchuria and Mishan in Xing'an Province were forcibly moved 15 li into our territory by the Soviets, and the local people are very angry.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 10th] A tea diplomacy authority told reporters that according to the Moscow dispatch of the United Press on the 9th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Outer Mongolian government issued a communique stating that the Chinese government condoned its troops invading the Mongolian territory seven times, etc., which was purely their consistent false accusation. Our government will issue a formal statement in the coming days to refute it. As for the boundary line issue mentioned at the end of the communique, it is indeed the cause of the recent dispute, but whether the Soviet-Mongolian map is reliable is a big question. The speech made by Luo Jialun, our ambassador to India, in Delhi a week ago is very noteworthy. The evidence provided in the speech makes us keenly aware of the past events in the late Qing Dynasty. The large tracts of land outside the Anling Mountains north of Heilongjiang were lost due to the fact that the Imperial Russia transplanted boundary stones. Outer Mongolia's pretext for sophistry on the Beitashan incident is nothing but a clumsy plagiarism. We have already seen through its deceit and will not allow it to do whatever it wants.</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Pilgrimage Site for Muslims</h3>
<p>— Wu Tegong</p>
<p>Every year, the pilgrimage groups organized by Muslims from various provinces must take a boat from this city to their destination—Mecca (called Mank by Muslims). In previous years, when the pilgrimages passed through the capital to this city, only the co-religionists entertained them, and no one from the outside world contacted them, so they came and went silently. But this year is very different from previous years. Before everyone set off from their province, they were treated by the local authorities and airlines, who reserved airplane seats. After gathering in the capital, they were summoned and comforted by Chairman Chiang, and entertained by various parties on separate days. Recently, when the group arrived in this city, they were received by Mayor Wu, and Chairman Pan of the City Council held a tea party on behalf of the council to express their welcome. Many field reporters from various newspapers also visited the group's temporary residence (Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Laoximen) to interview everything, wrote articles, and published them in the newspapers, which aroused the enthusiastic attention of the general readers.</p>
<p>Why does the government particularly value the pilgrimage group this year, contrary to its previous attitude, and provide them with various conveniences? There must be a reason for this. Muslims attach great importance to the pilgrimage, because this is one of the main doctrines recorded in the Muslim Quran. However, this act contains not only personal faith and religious significance, but also the relationship of national diplomacy and international politics. There are more than 50 million Muslim compatriots in our country, most of whom live in the northwestern border provinces, and their unity is very strong. Unfortunately, the general national education level in the border provinces is too low, and the transportation is very inconvenient. Most Muslim believers do not know the national language, and they are located in remote areas, and their vision is limited, so they are simple-minded and have a weak national concept, and they are easily tempted by ambitious people outside the border. Pilgrims traveling to Xinjiang Province mostly pass through the Soviet Union in northern Xinjiang, and mostly pass through India in southern Xinjiang: others in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces also take the grassland route and detour through Tibet. When Muslims in our country go abroad, they do not have passports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of their own country. This not only often causes bad effects internationally, but also gives foreigners who hold aggressive doctrines an easier opportunity to divide and alienate. This does contain a potential danger to the country.</p>
<p>The most unfortunate thing is that last year's pilgrimage group, composed of Xinjiang and other provinces, had more than 70 people. After arriving in this city, due to the relationship of returning to the capital, foreign exchange passports and transportation could not be processed in time, and they missed the pilgrimage date. Therefore, the members of the group had to return to their hometowns in disappointment. Just imagine that they spent a lot of money and traveled long distances, but they still could not fulfill their lifelong aspirations when they arrived at the departure point by boat. This will naturally cause a bad impression on the government due to misunderstandings. Not only them, but also the co-religionists in the country and overseas at that time also regarded it as a great regret. This matter has little effect on Muslims, but it has a great effect on the government, because the annual pilgrimage ceremony is attended by Muslims from more than 40 countries around the world, many of whom are important people and scholars. They share the same belief, have the same aspirations, and are as close as brothers. This is very important in national diplomacy. China was the only country missing from the large group of pilgrims last year, so the public had all kinds of questions about our government, and they could not help but have a bad feeling.</p>
<p>The pilgrimage date this year is approaching, and the China Islamic Association in the capital (Chairman is General Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense) has initiated the organization of a pilgrimage group in view of the mistakes of last year, and has prepared everything in advance. Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, also telegraphed the central government to request assistance. Finally, the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee and others asked Chairman Chiang to approve that the pilgrimage group this year be limited to 40 people, and each person would be allowed to purchase 180 pounds of British gold foreign exchange at the official price to cover the travel expenses to the destination. When the group came to Shanghai from Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the China Islamic Association, and the Tianshan Society sent personnel to escort them and help them complete all the procedures for going abroad. Moreover, because there were several Uyghurs from Xinjiang in the pilgrimage, who could not speak the language, the Central Organization Department sent two translators to serve as interpreters. The hospitality this time was unprecedented, and the pilgrimage group was of course very grateful. When they reach their destination in the future and return to their hometowns in the future, they will naturally publicize the government's benevolence and wash away the bad things of last year.

<h3>The Radium Institute of the Peking Research Institute Begins to Study Atomic Energy; Yan Jici Talks About the Soviet Union's Ability to Manufacture Atomic Bombs; The Saying of Flying Saucers and Flying Discs Is Just Worrying Unnecessarily</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Director of the Electrical Research Institute of the Peking Research Institute, Mr. Yan Jici, arrived in Nanjing and stayed at the Academia Sinica. He talked with reporters about the following four questions: (1) The current status of atomic energy research in our country. (2) Whether the Soviet Union can manufacture atomic bombs. (3) The possibility of applying atomic energy to general industries. (4) What kind of attitude should we take to the appearance of so-called "flying saucers." Mr. Yan said: (1) The study of atomic energy in our country has just begun. As far as the colleagues of the Radium Institute of the Peking Research Institute are concerned, they are now focusing their energy on this topic. Deputy Director Li Shuhua also has considerable knowledge of this. The relationship between the various academic departments is very close, so physicists are now involved in atomic energy issues. The institute's personnel and equipment still need to be actively enriched so that research work can be carried out in a planned manner. Researcher Qian Sanqiang discovered a new method of atomic nucleus fission in France, and atomic physics authority Joliot and others praised it highly. The institute did not urge him to return to the country, because the domestic research equipment is certainly not as perfect as the research institutes in Europe. (2) There is no doubt that the Soviet Union can now manufacture atomic bombs. If the Soviet Union cannot manufacture them, then we cannot understand. The research on atomic energy has been kept secret by various countries since 1939. At that time, Germany, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain had all achieved considerable results. Scientists do not need to exchange experimental reports, and in fact, they can invent each other. The performance and power of the atomic bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima is nothing less than an encouragement or stimulus to Soviet scientists. Today, two years have passed, and it is not surprising that the Soviet Union can manufacture atomic bombs. The Soviet Union's political system is conducive to concentrating manpower and material resources to carry out this specialized experiment, and their original intention and vigilance also prompted them to engage in the manufacture of atomic bombs. As for France, science is also very prosperous, but we may not dare to assert that it can manufacture atomic bombs, because the political system, economic system and other conditions are very different from those of the Soviet Union. (3) Atomic energy will certainly be applied to general industries in the future. Atomic energy experts are currently conducting various experiments in this area, but the problem is not so simple. Even from the perspective of pure science, atomic energy can be applied to industry, but whether it is implemented depends on the decision of entrepreneurs and the political system and economic system at the time. (4) The appearance of "flying saucers" is an unconscious manifestation of human fear. Since the invention of the atomic bomb, all mankind has been in danger.</p>
<h3>Chief Chen Inspects Kaiyuan; The Northeast Headquarters Expands Its Organization; The Commander's Offices Will Be Set Up in Shenyang, Changchun, and Longjiang</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 10th] The expansion of the organization of the Northeast Headquarters is actively underway. It is reported that the Headquarters will set up three Pacification Commander's Offices, namely Shenyang, Changchun, and Longjiang. The candidate for the Director of Longjiang is Ma Zhanshan, and the others are not yet known.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 10th] Chief Chen Cheng, accompanied by Zheng Dongguo and Zhou Fucheng, went to Kaiyuan for inspection at 9:00 AM on the 10th and returned to Shenyang on the same day.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 10th] Shenyang electric report: Chief of Staff General Chen Cheng has personally arranged to defend against the most intense offensive of the Northeast Communists in the autumn. Chen is busy presiding over military conferences. If the Communist army attacks again, he may personally command the battle. The National Army has made considerable progress in Jilin and has crossed the Songhua River into the Communist army area. However, the Communist army that withdrew from Siguping has not escaped far and is now re-gathering in Siping and near Changchun.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 10th] The victory or defeat of the National Army in the sixth offensive launched by the Northeast Communist Army in the future is enough to determine the fate of the national military. Informed sources in China said that this was the theme of the sudden arrival of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng a few days ago and his evening talk with Special Envoy Wei Te-mai. The Northeast military authorities have made resolute preparations for the offensive. The military and political affairs here will be unified under the command of Chief Chen, with Zheng Dongguo, Commander of the Northeast Security, as his deputy. Once the affairs in North China come to an end, troops will be transferred from Shandong to strengthen the defense here. The unification of the military and political affairs is an essential step to remedy the existing shortcomings. However, the overall mechanism is still very weak, and it must be presided over by a strong person to cope with the future offensive of the Communist army. The war in the Northeast is currently silent, and it is unusually peaceful here. Only the sound of artillery testing can be heard remotely in the suburbs at night. The curfew time has also been extended from 10:00 PM to 11:30 PM. However, all life is still serious.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Sun Liren, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, arrived in Beiping by plane from Shanghai at 1:30 PM on the 10th. On the 11th and 12th, he will fly to Changchun to participate in the memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the New First Army held in Changchun on August 13th.</p>
<h3>Military and Political Conference Held in Beiping to Discuss Ways to Simplify the Organization</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 10th] The Beiping Headquarters held military and political conferences on the evening of the 9th and the morning of the 10th, presided over by Li Zongren. Participants included the newly appointed Deputy Director Wu Qiwei, Chief of Staff Xu Qiming, Sun Lianzhong, Director of the Baoding Pacification Office and Chairman of Hebei Province, Deputy Directors Chen Jicheng and Song Kentang, Liu Duoquan, Chairman of Rehe Province, and Fu Zuoyi, Director of the Zhangyuan Pacification Office and Chairman of Chahar Province, who rushed over at 7:00 PM last night. Zhu Ke participated late, and had a long private conversation with Li Zongren until late at night. It is said that Fu returned to Zhangyuan by plane at 3:00 PM on the 10th. The Beiping Headquarters continued to hold a meeting on the morning of the 10th, presided over by Chief Secretary Xiao Yishan. Participants included Shi Delin, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Government, Song Kentang, Deputy Director of the Baoding Pacification Office, Deng Jiyu, Secretary-General of the Beiping Municipal Government, Liang Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Government, Li Teng, Director of the Zhangyuan Pacification Office in Beiping, and Su Ting, Director of the Education Department of the Suiyuan Provincial Government. At the leaders' meeting last night, the division of powers between the headquarters and the pacification offices was discussed in detail, and it was decided to strengthen the supervisory power of the headquarters. At the same time, research was also conducted on the coordination of military and political affairs and the simplification of the organization, and five principles were determined. On the morning of the 10th, the chiefs of staff of the provinces and cities continued to study the specific ways to simplify the organization and rectify financial problems. It is reported that Li Zongren received instructions from the highest authorities in Nanjing to adjust and simplify the military and political organizations in the north.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th] Director Fu Zuoyi returned to Zhangyuan by official plane from Beiping at 4:40 PM on the 10th.</p>
<h3>The Communist Bandits Are Obviously Traitorous; Usurping the Title of the Chinese Soviet People's Republic; Cadres Are Being "Purged" and Fleeing One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 10th] The Communist bandits are usurping the title of the Chinese Soviet People's Republic, and important documents and foreign propaganda have been changed accordingly. The so-called Northwest Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will be set up in Ximatigou, Suide. Communist bandit cadres captured in western Shanxi confessed: The bandits' current method of struggle is to kill landlords and overthrow owner-peasants. Even landlords and gentry who are impoverished and driven by the bandits will eventually be killed. In Heshun and Liaoxian, the Communist bandits force women to go barefoot and stipulate that whoever wears socks will be struggled against.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The Communist bandits in northern Songjiang have clearly announced their betrayal of the motherland and ordered the people in northern Songjiang to tear up the flag of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth and change to the Soviet flag. This was compared to the news obtained by a certain agency in the interim listening to the Harbin Xinhua News Agency radio station. The Communist bandits held a meeting of the pseudo-Northeast Administrative Committee in Harbin on August 1. Bandit leaders Lin Feng, Lu Zhengcao, Chen Yun, Zhang Xueji, Tang Kai, and Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China, who had just returned to Harbin from North Korea, attended the meeting. They decided to arm the "liberated areas," arm the people's spirit, and arm the people's property, and expand the military recruitment movement. After the meeting, they telegraphed the Soviet Union to thank them for their "many aids." The decision to change the national flag was also included. Previously, in the Siping campaign, the "Labor Hero" badge captured by the National Army from the Communist bandits was painted with the Soviet Red Star and the sickle and hammer.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th] The Communist bandits' "purge" has affected cadres. It is reported that in Guoxian, northern Shanxi, no less than hundreds of middle and lower-level cadres of the Communist bandits have been purged by their superiors. One Liu, a villager of Nanmai, had been running a cooperative for the bandits in Jingle for ten years. Because he had accumulated a little wealth, he was coveted by his superiors, who used the name of poverty to launch a purge struggle against him. Recently, he committed suicide out of anger because he could not bear the humiliation, which caused uneasiness among the middle and lower-level cadres of the bandits, who fled one after another. Fearing that their fragile lives could not last until tomorrow morning, they became suspicious, and "flying saucers" and "airplanes" filled the sky. As for whether it was originally a meteorite or some kind of aircraft, it is not important. What is reflected here is the most important significance of human fear. Finally, Mr. Yan elaborated on whether the United Nations should control Japan's research on atomic energy. Mr. Yan believes that even if Japan is given full freedom to research atomic energy, Japan does not have to bury itself in research. The national character of the country values practicality most, and scientists will concentrate their efforts to study some more urgent problems. Also, their narrow-mindedness may often turn their thoughts to retaliating against the United States in the future, but they may not plan to retaliate with atomic bombs.</p>
<h3>Mongol Bandits Invade on Two Routes, Attempting to Attack Tumurtay</h3>
<p>Yulin Airfield Has Been Recovered</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Suiyuan, 9th] On the morning of the 8th, Mongol bandits attacked Gehuasizhao, 20 miles northeast of Tumurtay, in two routes. They have been driven by the National Army to a location two miles southeast of Gehuasizhao, and are now awaiting subsequent troops, with a major offensive planned against Tumurtay Heqigang. Also, they launched an attack from Honggeertu on the National Army, and the Mongol bandits were repelled at Wayaogou. Uleji Aosuer burned Shangdu Tunken Township and then fled to Shang Wangfu.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Gui Sui, 9th] Today, there is no change in the situation at Qing Shuihe, Youwang. Three hundred bandits were discovered 20 miles south of Zuoyun City on the evening of the 7th, and they set fire to five villages before fleeing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 10th] On the 5th, Communist bandit Wang Zhen led five brigades and briefly occupied the airfield outside the south gate of Yulin, causing damage. Now the garrison in Yulin has counterattacked and recovered the airfield, and aircraft can now land.</p>
<h3>Jilin's Defense Capabilities Strengthened, Hada Bay Airfield Completed</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Changchun, 10th] Military News Agency reports: The Jilin Hada Bay Airfield, which began construction one month ago, has now been completed and a completion ceremony was held on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 10th] Liang Huasheng, Chairman of Jilin Province, told reporters in a firm tone: "Jilin's defense capabilities have been greatly strengthened. Before the completion of the Communist bandits' sixth offensive, our army can launch an attack at any time." The Jilin Changyi Volunteer Army has been formed under widespread military education, with a strength of over 50,000 people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 10th] Communist bandits in the northern Jilin area seem to be reinforcing for a counterattack, and small battles are occurring everywhere. However, the bandits are all new recruits and are defeated with a single blow. The bandit troops in Fengkou Tun, Xiaoguang Tun and other places have all been severely attacked by the National Army and fled back.</p>

<h3>Black Communist Aircraft Attack Qingdao, Possibly Flying from Lushun-Dalian, Plains War in Shandong Province Underway</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Well-informed sources here do not deny the report of Communist aircraft bombing Qingdao, and said: Communist aircraft attacks are not the first. Before this, Linyi, Tengxian, and other places have been attacked. The Communist army has concentrated more than 160 aircraft in Lushun-Dalian, which were received from the Japanese by a certain party. Also, Xin Yourui, Director of the Air Defense Department of the Air Force Headquarters (not the Army Headquarters), has been ordered to inspect the national air defense, and a group of more than ten people has arrived in Beiping. According to a Beiping dispatch reported here on the 10th, "Qingdao Airport was attacked by black aircraft, and four bombs landed at the airport, which did not explode and caused no damage. It is estimated that it may be Communist aircraft flying from Lushun-Dalian, or it may be for propaganda purposes. Officials claim that there is absolutely no problem with the air defense in North China, and even if aircraft from outside the Communist bandits attack, they will be repelled."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Chairman Sun Dao stated that he had not heard of the strange aircraft bombing Qingdao Airport on the 9th as reported in Chinese newspapers. Also, the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense confirmed on the afternoon of the 10th that an unidentified black aircraft bombed Qingdao Airport on the 9th. The spokesperson initially said he had no information, but then agreed to investigate the details. He later said that the incident did occur, but he had not yet learned the details. Another neutral military source here, who should have known about this matter, claimed that he had no knowledge of the Qingdao bombing.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Jinan, 10th] The situation of the National Army in Shandong is gradually developing. In the past week, about 5,500 square kilometers of land have been recovered, totaling 52,000 square kilometers, with 85,000 square kilometers still in the hands of the Communists. The mountain warfare has ended, and the plains war is now underway. The remnants of six columns and seven thousand troops of the Communist bandits who collapsed in the mountainous area have retreated to the area north of the Jiaoji Railway and south of the Xiaoqing River, around Linzi, Guangrao, Shangao, Yuanyi, and Zhangdian, where they are being reorganized. The wounded soldiers, factories, and machinery have been transported to the north bank of the Yellow River. The Zichuan and Boshan mining areas have been without electricity for many days, and the machinery seems to have been transported away. In the area west of the Grand Canal in western Shandong and south of the Yellow River, there are about 40,000 remnants of Chen Yi's troops and about 50,000 remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops. The National Army is now besieging them from the east, west, and south, reaching four kilometers east of Yuncheng and seven kilometers south of Liangshan. The western front has also reached Liuzhuang, coordinating with the air force for a fierce attack. It is expected that the Communist bandits in western Shandong can be largely annihilated after the next battle.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] The National Army, advancing northwest from Jinxiang in western Shandong, formally recovered Juye at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. On the 10th, they continued to mop up the remnants of Liu Bocheng's 23rd Column and Independent Brigade in the suburbs. The National Army stationed on the south bank of the Yellow River ferry at Juancheng on the afternoon of the 9th, and more than 3,000 remnant bandits fled south from Shiwulipu, with the National Army in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] The main force of the Communist bandits led by Liu Bocheng, whose retreat route was cut off and who fled south to harass, was surrounded by the National Army in the Dingtao, Huixian, and Chengwu areas on the 9th, becoming increasingly distressed. There was some bandit activity near the Neihuang-Yejigang station on the Longhai Railway on the 9th, but it was cleared by the local garrison, and the road remained as safe as usual.</p>

<h3>Jakarta Chinese General Association Issues Appeal, Curbing Indonesian Military Atrocities, Overseas Chinese in Java and Other Places Are Being Massacred</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jakarta, 9th] This Jakarta Chinese General Association broadcast today, asking the world's press, the Chairman and members of the United Nations, and people's organizations around the world to work together to stop the atrocities of the Indonesian military in Java and Sumatra, who are killing overseas Chinese. [[United Press, Batavia, 9th] Hong Yuan (transliteration), Chairman of the Chinese General Association, a Chinese overseas group in the Dutch East Indies, broadcast today that the withdrawal of Dutch troops from the occupied areas of Java and Sumatra would lead to the slaughter of thousands of overseas Chinese by Indonesians, and asked the United Nations to urge the Indonesian government to release the thousands of overseas Chinese who have been captured by Indonesia. Hong had previously telegraphed the Security Council to take immediate steps to protect the minorities in the Indonesian Republic. It is estimated that there are now about two million overseas Chinese in the East Indies. Since the outbreak of the Dutch-Indonesian war, Dutch and Chinese officials have reported the killing of overseas Chinese by Indonesians from time to time. According to Hong, since the Japanese surrender, overseas Chinese have often been murdered, robbed, despised, and exploited by Indonesians. A year ago, 1,831 overseas Chinese were killed in Tanggerang. Since the recent outbreak of war, many overseas Chinese have been killed in Sumatra, where sixty overseas Chinese were locked in a house and burned alive, and some children were beheaded in Malang, Java. The Indonesian Republic in Java and Sumatra has often proven unable to control its troops, and the lives and property of overseas Chinese are still threatened. He asked the United Nations not to make a hasty decision on the Indonesian issue before listening to the statements of the overseas Chinese, and demanded that Indonesia compensate the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Grievous Sight, A Set of Photos Showing the Inhumanity of the Indonesian Military</h3>

Other photos showed unimaginable heinous acts. At least five of them could not be identified by their relatives. One of the victims was wearing a red dress when he was killed, and the genitals of several male victims were also cut off. A husband and wife died embracing each other.

<h3>Yingde Bridge Train Plunges into River Tragedy, Guangdong Provincial Assembly Releases Investigation Report, Estimated Deaths at Over 200</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] After the tragedy of the train plunging into the river at Yingde Bridge on the Yuehan Railway on July 14, people in society paid great attention to the responsibility and the number of deaths. In order to understand the truth, the Provincial Assembly and the Journalists Association, the Architects Association, and other groups formed an investigation team to Yingde. The investigation has now been completed, and its report was officially released by the Provincial Assembly, determining that the cause of the accident was indeed the bridge breaking and the train falling. Regarding the number of passengers and casualties, the report stated that the total number of passengers should be more than 400. The number of safe people and the number of injured reported by the Railway Bureau are still based, but the number of deaths is only calculated based on the number of recovered dead bodies, which is not accurate. According to the injured, the village chief of Nangang, and the residents of local boatmen and Niuweishan, more than a hundred corpses and broken limbs floated down the river afterward. The estimated number of deaths is often more than 200. The report finally pointed out that the railway's engineering equipment is incomplete. Due to the urgent post-war recovery, limited by time and material difficulties, everything was done simply, the vehicles were used for too long, and the telecommunications equipment was insufficient. The Ministry of Communications must seek remedies immediately and improve them quickly to ensure the safety of passengers and goods. The report also strongly condemned the illegal behavior of the garrison troops when the train fell into the river, and believed that the Railway Bureau, the garrison troops, and the local government were all responsible for the case.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Alertness of the American People</h3>
<p>The American magazine *Newsweek* recently published an editorial advocating direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union to resolve the disputes between the two countries around the world. The reasoning was: "If we are to avoid another world war, the only way is for the United States and the Soviet Union to negotiate directly. The Soviet Union has certain intentions and ambitions. The problems in Korea, Austria, and Germany are secondary, just part of the overall problem. But the main problem is how the United States and the Soviet Union will coexist peacefully in this world?" As for the method of direct negotiation, the magazine called on Secretary of State Marshall, Vandenberg, and Byrnes to form a delegation to meet with Stalin in Moscow to discuss a comprehensive plan to adjust the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. We know that *Newsweek* is the most powerful conservative publication in the United States. The suggestion of direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union at this moment can be regarded as the alertness of the American people. It not only shows that the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has evolved to the point of exhaustion, but also proves the seriousness of the world situation today.</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, it has been exactly two full years. The evolution of international politics in the past two years has not only completely shattered the ideal world that people yearned for during the war, turning it into a mirage, but it is also completely different from what people expected after the war. We are all disappointed in the face of this crisis-ridden world. In particular, the American government and the public are worried about the evolution of the world situation in the future. *Newsweek*'s editor David Lawrence suddenly proposed the suggestion of direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. This is the precursor to a change in the attitude of American public opinion towards the Soviet Union. Our research into the reasons for this change is due to the following factors:</p>
<p>First, the surfacing of the dollar panic in Britain and France has deepened the European economic crisis, which will threaten US exports. The trade situation in June and July of this year has already shown a downward trend. If this continues to deteriorate, it may cause an economic panic in the United States in 1948. The arrival of this economic panic can be said to be unanimously feared by the American government and the public. Therefore, before it arrives, the United States must do everything possible to try to save the economic crisis in European countries.</p>
<p>Second, Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan are both doomed to failure due to the Soviet Union's resolute opposition and unwillingness to compromise. The true meaning of the Truman Doctrine is that the United States uses its dollar diplomacy to assist weak countries in the world to prevent the intrusion of Soviet forces. However, the result of American aid to Greece and Turkey has promoted the coup d'état in Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland, making the division of Europe into Eastern and Western Europe more obvious. However, Eastern and Central Europe, under the control of the Soviet Union, have made significant progress in industrial recovery, which is a major blow to the prestige of the United States. On the contrary, in Western European countries, due to the dollar panic in Britain and France, a very serious economic crisis has been created. Secretary of State Marshall saw this situation and, in order to avoid the division of Europe, proposed a plan to aid European economic recovery. However, the result of the Paris conference was that not only did the Soviet Union refuse to participate, but also all countries controlled by the Soviet Union were unwilling to accept American aid with conditions. Although Britain and France want to proceed alone, the economic crisis in the two countries is becoming increasingly serious, which is another major blow to Marshall's aid to Europe plan.</p>
<p>Third, although the United States has continuously exerted pressure on the Soviet Union under the banner of the Truman Doctrine, it has encountered strong resistance from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union exercises its veto power on any important issue, causing the United States and the Soviet Union to fall into a stalemate. Not only can the problem of Europe not be resolved, but also the deadlock in the Far East cannot be broken. For example, on the German issue, because the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference ended unhappily, the German peace treaty failed to be negotiated. The United States then changed its goal and attempted to build Germany first, originally wanting to raise Germany's production level, but it was met with strong opposition from France. If France cannot suppress the opinions of the left wing, then France's opposition will be even stronger. Another example is the Japanese issue. The United States advocated convening a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty. The Soviet Union has expressed its refusal. Even if the United States abandons the Soviet Union and proceeds alone, other problems will arise between the United States and other countries. At present, China, Britain, the Philippines, Australia, Canada, and other countries have mostly expressed that they are not completely satisfied with the US policy toward Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, the United States today is facing such a serious world crisis and should think deeply, adopt a wise policy that will benefit both itself and others once and for all, so that the post-war world can safely overcome this major difficulty. Otherwise, if it allows the overall situation to develop naturally without trying to save it, the ending will eventually threaten the peace and prosperity of the United States.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Closes the Port of Dalian</h3>
<p>The US Information Service yesterday issued a message saying that the US State Department has confirmed that the Soviet Union notified the US authorities in March of this year that Dalian had become a closed port under military administration. Therefore, since March, US naval vessels have no longer entered Dalian. After this news was released, the American newspapers attached great importance to it and expressed indignation. Among them, the *World Telegram* refuted the Soviet Union's reasoning, saying: "The Soviet Union arbitrarily distorts the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, claiming that before the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, the Soviet Union can permanently maintain its military control over Dalian. According to this, the Soviet Union only needs to refuse to sign the Japanese peace treaty, and it can control Dalian forever." At the same time, according to the Associated Press, the US State Department is also very indignant at the Soviet Union's illegal behavior and plans to protest to the Soviet government in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Regarding the Dalian issue, the US government issued instructions to the embassies in China and the Soviet Union on January 3 of this year, notifying the governments of China and the Soviet Union to quickly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty on Dalian so that Dalian could resume normal status under the administration of the Chinese government. China has also repeatedly negotiated with the Soviet Union on the issue of receiving Dalian. However, the Soviet Union has adopted a delaying policy, repeatedly perfunctory, and has no sincerity in returning Dalian to China. Whether in terms of legal principles or in terms of affection and righteousness, the Soviet Union has no reason to refuse to return Dalian to China. In theory, after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, the Soviet Union should have returned Dalian to China. However, the Soviet Union insisted that Dalian was still in a state of war with Japan and that the Soviet Union could not transfer Dalian to China until after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty. This unreasonable argument is really not worth arguing, and it almost makes people suspect that the Soviet Union's foreign affairs authorities do not even have a little common sense of international justice. So what is the Soviet Union's intention? Clear-sighted people can see it at a glance? There is no need to elaborate. Dalian Mayor Long Xuesui told reporters in Beijing in February of this year about the issue of receiving Dalian, saying: "Recently, the municipal government sent people to Dalian for inspection. There are 40,000 to 50,000 CCP troops in the city, and the Soviet army is not stationed in the city. Therefore, the issue of receiving Dalian depends entirely on the CCP army. If only a few people are sent, they cannot be received. If troops are sent to cooperate, a conflict with the CCP army will inevitably occur."</p>
<p>Although the United States has long paid attention to the Dalian issue, a note will not be effective if it is not followed by diplomatic action. Moreover, the Soviet Union closed Dalian in March. Why did the United States remain silent at that time? Why is it only being released now? Therefore, the United States must bear considerable responsibility for the development of the situation in the Far East to this day due to its diplomatic inaction. We only hope that the US authorities will change their style from now on and make decisive decisions on everything. The so-called "preventing problems before they arise" must never miss the opportunity!</p>
<h3>The Significance of Muslim Pilgrimage Sites</h3>
<p>(Continued from the first page)</p>
<p>At present, Islam abroad has a vigorous revival. The Arab League has long been established, and the autonomous territories of India and Pakistan have recently been born. Egypt hopes to create the unity of the Nile River basin and is competing with Britain. The Republic of Indonesia (Muslims account for more than 90% of the total population) holds a scorched earth policy and is determined to fight the Netherlands to the death. Turkey, in this World War, remained neutral between the two great powers and served as a barrier to the Mediterranean, greatly assisting the United Nations. Even Morocco in French Africa has a movement for independence. The trend is turbulent and difficult to contain. The Islam in our country may have a response and a new movement. At the same time, foreign forces are politically enticing the Muslims in the border provinces. There are now six small Muslim republics in the Soviet Union outside Xinjiang Province, with a total of 30 million Muslims. Their material construction, cultural level, and living standards are all higher than those of the Muslims in Xinjiang Province. This kind of attraction is really frightening. I hope that the government authorities will have a broad vision and set policies early, promote their cultural undertakings, and increase all their welfare for the domestic Muslims in the future. For example, the excellent treatment given to the pilgrimage group this time will undoubtedly receive great results. It is hoped that the economy will improve in the future, foreign exchange will be relaxed, and a large pilgrimage group will be organized by the government every year, and they will be welcomed to Beijing early to stay for a considerable period of time. Scholars should be invited to explain to them the general situation of foreign countries, the situation of domestic politics, and the responsibilities of the people every day, and they should be allowed to put forward suggestions on Islam, which will be adopted by the government. This will definitely create a great centripetal force for Muslims towards the government.</p>
<p>This time, the pilgrimage group has a total of 40 people, more than half of whom are from Xinjiang Province, including one female. The oldest is Xinjiang Aibudula Da Mullah, 79 years old, and 19 people are over 60 years old. The youngest is Xinjiang Abudurexit, only 16 years old. Among them, the most prestigious people are briefly listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The above-mentioned Aibudula Da Mullah is from Kashi District, Xinjiang, of Uyghur ethnicity, knowledgeable and respected, and highly admired by the local co-religionists. His national concept is also very strong. This year is his second pilgrimage in his life. Chairman Maisut specially allocated a special plane to take him from Ili to Dihua, and then fly directly to the capital.</p>
<p>(2) Naizeer Da Achong (ie, Da Imam) is from Dihua District, Xinjiang, of Uyghur ethnicity, 73 years old this year. He has served as a member of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, a member of the Political Affairs Committee, and other important positions. He is loyal to his duties, has excellent character and academics, and is respected and loved by the general co-religionists. He is currently the Imam of Dihua District.</p>
<p>(3) Muhammad Ali is from Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang, 65 years old this year, proficient in Arabic, especially good at reading the scriptures. He has stayed in various countries in the Near East for more than ten years. He is currently hired by Chairman Ma of Qinghai as the Da Imam of Xining."</p>
<p>The pilgrimage group is scheduled to take a boat to Hong Kong on the 13th of this year, change to a Blue Funnel Line ship to sail to Jeddah on the Red Sea, which is the gateway to Arabia. After landing, they will take a long-distance bus to Mecca, rest for a while, and then participate in the pilgrimage ceremony.</p>
<p>The newspapers in Tokyo have also published articles about the pilgrimage group. Because it is dictated on the one hand and recorded on the other, there are many discrepancies with the facts, which are often read by Muslims with dissatisfaction. As a Muslim, the author knows more accurately, and in order to seek the truth, I have written a few lines to contribute to non-Muslim readers.</p>
<p>Islam has four main teachings, called the Four Pillars: (1) Prayer: From dawn to early night every day, pray to God five times, at fixed times, and everyone must gather in the mosque to hold it together. (2) Fasting: In the ninth month of the Islamic calendar every year, you must fast for a month, starting at dawn, and absolutely not eating or drinking. Break the fast at sunset, and you can eat as usual. (3) Zakat: Those who have accumulated money to a certain amount must give one-fortieth of it to the poor every year, called Zakat. Other products also have Zakat, but the donation rate is lower. (4) Pilgrimage: You must go to Mecca for pilgrimage once in your life. Those who do not have enough financial resources or are sick can be exempted. Each has its own meaning, but due to space limitations, it cannot be described in detail. Now I will only describe the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Pilgrimage, translated from Arabic as "Hajj", is traditionally called "Chao Hajj" by Muslims in our country, which is read as "Chao Han Zhi". Han Zhi is the name of the province, and Mecca is the capital of the province. The use of the term "pilgrimage group" this time has caused many misunderstandings, thinking that what is being visited is the tomb of the Prophet Muhammad. In fact, the Prophet is buried in Medina, which is quite a distance from Mecca. Pilgrims who are wealthy may go to visit by the way, but it is not within the etiquette of the pilgrimage. The so-called "pilgrimage" is actually a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. Because Mecca has the relics of ancient saints and is the birthplace of Islam, it is called the holy city. The ancient site is an ancient building, called "Kaaba" by Arabs and "Heavenly House" by Muslims in our country. According to the Quran, God ordered the ancient saint Ibrahim (ie, Abraham in the Old Testament Genesis) and his son to build the ancient room, which became the first place in the world to worship the Lord. There are also two small mountains, one called Safa and the other called Marwa, about 420 meters apart. When the Prophet Muhammad's ancestor Isma'il was held by his mother and entered Arabia for the first time, and reached between the two small mountains, the water in the leather bag he was carrying was completely drunk, so his mother circled the two small mountains to find water, and finally found it, so that the mother and son could quench their thirst and avoid dying of thirst under the scorching sun. The Heavenly House and the two small mountains had long been revered as holy sites before the establishment of Islam.</p>
<p>Pilgrims must arrive in Mecca before the seventh day of the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, that is, bathe and cleanse themselves, and change into the clothes of abstinence. The clothes of abstinence are two pieces of white cloth, not sewn, wrapped around the whole body, and no hat is worn on the head. The clothes usually worn, as well as all ornaments, must be removed. Women must not use cosmetics. Because pilgrimage means to abandon all the superficiality of the world and dedicate oneself to God. Pilgrims first go to the Kaaba, that is, the Heavenly House, and circle it seven times, and kiss a small black stone inlaid on the wall to show their sincerity in loving God. (2) After performing a short prayer in the Heavenly House, they run between the two small mountains mentioned above to express their perseverance. On the seventh day, everyone gathers to listen to the meaning of the pilgrimage. On the eighth day, the official ceremony begins, and everyone enters the Mina Valley (about six miles north of Mecca) to spend the night. On the ninth day, they advance to the Arafat Plain and Mount Arafat, about five miles further north, to commemorate the reunion of Adam and Eve after they were separated. The tenth day is Eid al-Adha. Each pilgrim slaughters an animal in the Mina Valley, symbolizing their willingness to sacrifice themselves for God. The slaughtered animals are distributed to the nearby poor, and seven stones are thrown to express their rejection of evil. Then the ceremony is completed, and the clothes of abstinence can be removed and the usual clothes can be changed. After that, you can stay for two or three days, and then set off back home.</p>
<p>For these etiquettes, they do not hesitate to travel thousands of miles through the dust, and this year, the sixth month of the Chinese lunar calendar is the month of Ramadan, and they endure hunger and thirst every day from morning to evening on the long journey of pilgrimage. Moreover, Mecca is located in the tropics, and the weather is very hot. During the few days of the ceremony, they walk bareheaded under the scorching sun. Old people in their seventies and eighties can endure this kind of hardship. Their enthusiasm for respecting God and their perseverance can be regarded as unparalleled in the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the languages of various countries, the term "Mecca" is used as a metaphor for "a place to which all people are inclined" or "the birthplace of faith, policies, great undertakings, etc." (End)</p>

<h3>The Labour Party's Internal Opinions Cannot Be Unanimous: The British Government Faces a Crisis; The Issue of Steel Nationalization Is the Most Important; Labour MPs Will Hold a Special Meeting Today for Secret Review</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The Labour Party is now facing the most serious threat of internal division in its two years in power. Attlee and his cabinet are now facing opposition from both the left and right wings. The right-wing Conservative Party and Liberal Party have formed a united front to oppose the emergency powers to guide manpower requested by the Labour Party. On the left, some members of the Labour Party have expressed stronger protests than last year when they opposed Bevin's foreign policy. About 400 Labour MPs are scheduled to meet on Monday to question Attlee and his advisors on three issues: demanding more troop reductions, adopting a more powerful design to concentrate national manpower and resources on production industries, and most importantly, demanding that the government fully implement the Labour Party's steel nationalization plan. Minister of Health Bevin has recently emerged as the leader of the left wing. He has made it clear that he is absolutely opposed to any concessions on the steel nationalization plan, and the newspaper report that he would resign if he did not achieve his goal has not been denied by Bevin to this day. The issue of steel nationalization has gradually become an indication of whether the government will make concessions in the implementation of its livelihood policy or move more aggressively. Therefore, Labour backbenchers attach great importance to this issue. Any decision made by the government on the steel nationalization plan will affect the entire approach to coping with the economic crisis. Among the key government ministers, only Commerce Secretary and Economic Design Officer Cripps has maintained his reputation in the face of the division of opinions within the Labour Party. The left wing accuses Foreign Secretary Bevin of being one of the strongest opponents of troop reductions, and Privy Council President Morrison is accused of delaying the implementation of the steel nationalization plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] Prime Minister Attlee was accused by the Conservative Party today of seeking "totalitarianism" in dealing with the British economic crisis. At the same time, new disputes have arisen within the Labour Party over the government's nationalization plan. It is heard that some cabinet members are opposed to implementing the steel nationalization plan in this time of economic danger, so a special secret meeting of Labour MPs has been convened.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 10th] According to reliable diplomatic sources, the British Labour government will withdraw British troops stationed in Italy and Greece within a month to save the British economic crisis. The source said: According to unofficial estimates, there are about 10,000 to 15,000 British troops stationed in Italy, and Britain will withdraw them regardless of whether the peace treaty with Italy is absorbed or implemented. Left-wing liberals have put pressure on the Labour government to withdraw troops stationed in Greece, and the number of British troops stationed in Greece has now been reduced to more than 5,000. It is also reported that Prime Minister Attlee is scheduled to broadcast to the nation at 8:15 pm on the 10th, asking the nation to work hard during this economic period.</p>
<h3>Britain, the United States, and France Will Hold a Meeting to Review the German Industrial Standard, but It Will Not Affect the British-American Ruhr Coal Production Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall has agreed to hold a meeting of Britain, France, and the United States as soon as possible to discuss the German industrial standard and the coal issue. Marshall's decision was informed to the French government by the US Ambassador to Britain today, and a copy was given to Ballantyne, the British Chargé d'Affaires in Washington.</p>
<p>Marshall's note to the French government said: "The United States government is prepared to agree to convene a meeting of representatives of the United States, Britain, and France without delay to discuss the plan to revise the German industrial standard, so that the French opinion can be taken into account before the plan is finally adopted by the British and American governments, and to study and explain the goal of the plan. Regarding the management and control of the Ruhr coal mine, the United States government is also prepared to accept and discuss the French government's opinion with the governments of Britain and France. The French government will be notified of the suggestion to hold discussions on the German industrial standard and the management and control of the Ruhr coal mine." A State Department spokesman said: The date and location of this meeting will be announced later. The representatives attending the meeting will not be cabinet members, but it is hoped that the French government can soon send senior experts to Washington. He also stated that the plan to convene a three-nation meeting will not hinder the British-American Ruhr coal production meeting scheduled for Tuesday. Marshall's note indicated that he had accepted France's protest against the German industrial standard plan agreed upon by Britain and the United States. Marshall acknowledged that he had received a note from French Ambassador Bonnet, in which he stated that the French government attached great importance to the German issue. He also revealed that he had informed Paris on July 21 that he would postpone the announcement of the German industrial plan until the French government had a reasonable opportunity to express its opinion. At that time, Marshall had said that he was exchanging opinions with Foreign Secretary Bevin on this issue, and Bevin replied that the British government was considering the entire issue. From this, it can be seen that Marshall's note to France today has the complete agreement of the British government. A State Department spokesman added: There are currently no plans to include France in next Tuesday's British-American Ruhr coal production meeting.</p>
<h3>American Film Merchants Hope the State Department Will Assist in Forcing Britain to Change Its Tax Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] It is reported that representatives of Hollywood British film merchants will meet with State Department officials so that the State Department can support the film merchants' position and force the British government to change its policy of levying 75% of film income tax. Observers believe that the emergency embargo measures announced by Johnston, President of the Motion Picture Association of America, yesterday are intended to intimidate Britain and force it to change its original intention. The extension of the embargo is a major blow to the American film industry, and it will have to greatly reduce the production of Hollywood and only produce cheap films.</p>
<h3>Austin Advocates That the Veto Power Must Not Be Abused</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Austin, the US chief representative to the United Nations, broadcast today that the United Nations does not need to change its charter to solve various world problems. Austin is convinced that the charter does not need to be amended, but believes that the charter is not a static tool, but an active organism. He said that the main thing we want to end is in this respect. This is not a question of the use of the veto power, but a question of the abuse of the veto power, so the level of Internet ethics must be promoted and raised. Another US representative to the United Nations, Dulles, recently requested a reduction in the five veto powers of the Security Council. It is generally believed that Austin's statement today further indicates that the United States may propose amending the use of the five veto powers at the future United Nations General Assembly, but regardless of the actual amendment of the charter. Dulles once stated that the veto power should not be used for administrative affairs.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Is Invited to Visit France at the End of the Month</h3>

<h3>Statement from the Republic of Indonesia: Willing to Accept Mediation by the U.S. and Australia; Sends Note to the Security Council Accusing the Netherlands of Violating the Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Radio Yogyakarta broadcasted a letter from Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir to Australian Prime Minister Chifley, expressing gratitude and accepting Australia's willingness to participate in mediating the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The statement declared that the Indonesian government fully accepts the Australian government's proposal to participate in the Security Council's efforts to achieve a fair resolution of the Indonesian-Dutch dispute. The joint U.S.-Australian proposal for mediating the Indonesian dispute was put forward in the Security Council meeting last night.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 9th] The Republic of Indonesia sent a note to the Security Council stating that the Netherlands continues to engage in military activities with the aim of expanding its territory. Therefore, Republican troops have been forced to undertake pacification and defensive movements. Supported by aircraft and artillery, Dutch forces have occupied Huakir, approximately two miles south of Malang in East Java, and are attacking in several other locations. The Dutch forces violated the ceasefire order between August 1st and 8th, taking hostile actions intended to undermine the Republic of Indonesia's efforts to maintain a ceasefire. Therefore, it was necessary to carry out pacification and defensive movements in several locations to counter Dutch aggression and safeguard the Republic's position.</p>
<h3>Dutch Aggression More Thorough Than Japanese; Sjahrir Arrives in U.S. to Speak</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 9th] Former Prime Minister Sjahrir, Plenipotentiary Representative of the Republic of Indonesia, told reporters today that the recent Dutch offensive is more thorough than the Japanese invasion. This is a thorough, planned, and thoroughly executed real war. He also pointed out that Dutch forces used flamethrowers and heavy weapons, but could not specify where they were used. Sjahrir added that his arrival in New York was to make contact with the Indian and Australian delegations, who have already raised the Indonesian issue in the Security Council. Sjahrir said: "My government has already suggested that the Security Council immediately send a commission to Indonesia to determine whether both sides are adhering to the ceasefire order. The current dispute in Indonesia began with the Netherlands failing to fulfill its treaty obligations. We accept the U.S. mediation proposal because we believe the U.S. recognizes this as part of the Security Council's planned actions. We sincerely hope that the Security Council can appoint countries such as India and Australia, together with the U.S., to implement the measures deemed necessary by the Council." Sjahrir continued, saying that the Republic of Indonesia has retreated to the point before the Linggadjati Agreement was established and will demand the establishment of a sovereign state encompassing all of Indonesia, not merely the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. Sjahrir also stated that he does not intend to speak with representatives of the Dutch delegation to the United Nations. When reporters asked about his policy in future negotiations with the Netherlands, he said that if the Indonesian people can achieve independence in 1949, their goal can be achieved, and during the transition period, the Republic of Indonesia should have the right to normal existence.</p>

A memorandum has been submitted to U.S. Ambassador to Greece, MacVeagh, detailing Greece's current dual problems: combating insurgents and post-war reconstruction. The memorandum states that guerrilla forces are very active and constantly receiving supplies from the north.

<h3>Nehru Sympathizes with Indonesia; Reaffirms Asian "Monroe Doctrine"</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] Indian Interim Government Foreign Minister Nehru declared here: "We must clearly state that we will never tolerate foreign troops operating within Asian territory. The governance of India has given some foreign countries an excuse to govern smaller, weaker nations in Asia. Some small countries, because of their location on the route from England to Asia, have come under British control. These countries will gradually escape the clutches of imperialism. The Netherlands has no right to retain troops or military power in Indonesia. I am, in principle, opposed to the troops of one country stationed in another country. The Netherlands, which was unable to protect itself a few years ago, should not have the right to become an imperialist power again. The success of the Indonesian people depends on their own strength."</p>
<h3>Germ Warfare Horrifying; Even Worse Than Atomic Warfare</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] If another world war were to occur and germ weapons were used, eleven pounds of diphtheria toxin could wipe out the entire population of the United States, estimated at 140 million. This terrifying prediction was published by Harvard University botany professor Sherman in an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Discussing the terrifying possibilities of future germ warfare, he stated that in addition to rust fungus being used to destroy grain crops, cholera, dysentery, plague, and other bacteria would be used to spread disease. A third type, diphtheria toxin and other similar toxins produced by bacteria, would be even more lethal than atomic bombs. Predicting the horrors of germ warfare, he concluded that humans, as organic organisms dependent on other organisms for sustenance, can be destroyed biologically, along with their food.</p>
<h3>Wildfire in California Burns Over Ten Thousand Acres; 4,000-Year-Old Trees Threatened</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 9th] Several wildfires have recently broken out in California forests. It is reported that 3,000 people are currently working to extinguish the flames.

None of the fires are yet under control.</p>
<h3>Committee for European Economic Cooperation Drafts Report Outline</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 9th] After three and a half weeks of intense work, the outline of the report on the state of European resources and needs, drafted by the sixteen-nation Committee for European Economic Cooperation, will soon be clear. Most of the figures and information required to complete this report have been collected, and the remainder will arrive shortly. The members have intensified their work in compiling it. Officials are unwilling to make predictions about the future economic shape of Europe, as this largely depends on Germany's future industrial level. The Cooperation Committee can only roughly estimate the potential contribution of German steel supplies to the European economy. The final decision must be made by another body. In addition, an event that could assist the work of the Cooperation Committee and help alleviate the world's dollar shortage is the establishment of a rational monetary system in Germany, enabling Germany to pay for its imports. This event is also not within the purview of the Cooperation Committee. The Cooperation Committee is currently studying the possibility of making the currencies of the sixteen countries freely convertible. Germany's lack of a currency for external use will be a serious obstacle to this task.</p>

<h3>Reynolds Bomb Completes Round-the-World Flight</h3>
<p>Audun's Flying Speed is Fast, but Miss White is Born Even Faster</p>
<p>[United Press, Anchorage, Alaska, 10th] American solo round-the-world pilot Audun continued flying from Tokyo. After a non-stop flight of eleven hours and seventeen minutes, he safely landed at this airport. He then flew to Chicago at 8:47 a.m. standard time (5:47 a.m. Shanghai time) this morning. Since departing from Chicago, Audun has flown over 16,500 miles, taking 61 hours and 30 minutes, with an average speed of over 300 miles per hour. There are still 3,000 miles from here back to Chicago, which will take at least ten hours to reach. Audun hopes to break Post's 136-hour round-the-world flight record in half the time. It is likely he will be unable to fulfill this. However, he seems to have a good chance of breaking his own record of 78 hours and 55 minutes for a round-the-world flight in April this year.</p>
<p>Audun predicted before continuing his flight from here this morning, "I will arrive in Chicago between 11:00 a.m. and noon on Sunday (around 6:00 a.m. on the 11th in Shanghai and Hong Kong time)". Audun's physical strength seems to be very good, but he said, "I am extremely tired."</p>

Audun had taken Bruce to Hollywood so that Bruce could take care of his wife's delivery. Audun had wagered a case of soda, saying that he could complete his round-the-world flight before the child was born. Miss White was born as Audun arrived in Tokyo.</p>

<h3>First Batch of Soviet Overseas Chinese Board Ship to Return Home; Looking Back with Sighs; Reluctant to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report by this newspaper] There are a total of more than 20,000 Soviet overseas Chinese in this city, many of whom have had drifting lives and years of wandering, and have been running bars, cafes, and other businesses in Shanghai for more than ten years. Recently, the Soviet Union has been attracting overseas Chinese to return home in batches. The repatriation ship Ilyitch arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Yesterday, the first batch of Soviet overseas Chinese to board the ship numbered more than 1,000, half of whom were women. It is said that many had been unemployed for a long time. There were also some senior businessmen who had accumulated assets in Shanghai and voluntarily boarded the ship to return home.</p>
<p>The Ilyitch was originally a German oil tanker. After the war, it was classified as a reparations ship and incorporated into the Soviet Union, with a deadweight tonnage of 15,000 tons. The ship departed from Shanghai at 5:00 p.m. yesterday and sailed directly to Vladivostok. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai within a week to continue the repatriation work. There are still about 4,000 Soviet overseas Chinese here waiting for the ship to return home.</p>
<p>Among the first batch of Soviet overseas Chinese repatriated yesterday were Sfilov, who had served as chairman of the Shanghai Soviet Overseas Chinese Association and the Soviet Overseas Chinese Club for many years, Wan Ning, a representative of the Soviet Overseas Chinese community, Taylor, and others. They have been in China for a long time and seemed quite saddened by this evacuation. In addition, most of the women and children changed into new clothes and waved farewell to those seeing them off on the pier from the railing. The people on the ship and the pier gazed at each other in the hot sun, silently, and the situation was very desolate. The meals on the ship were simple. At lunch, each person had only a black bread and a small amount of vegetarian dishes. When eating, the elderly often looked back at the Huangpu River and sighed. Other young people sat silently with their chins in their hands. When reporters inquired about the past struggles of staying in Shanghai and how they would live after returning home, they smiled and did not answer, only frequently expressing their reluctance to leave.</p>

<h3>Staggering, Crowded, and Endless: A Cross-Section of Life at the Post Office Building</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Under the blazing sun, the green postal flag seemed to be panting as it faced the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Inside this building, people sending letters were holding letters and anxiously searching for the window that could help them, and behind the windows, postal workers were constantly wiping sweat from their brows...</p>
<p>Amitabha, You Mustn't Touch It!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a monk squeezed into the "Registered Mail" window, solemnly pulling out a neatly sealed square package from his cassock.</p>
<p>"Great monk, what book is in this package?" the female postal worker inside the window asked kindly.</p>
<p>The monk put his hands together, palms touching: "This is a copy of the Diamond Sutra that this humble monk respectfully transcribed after washing my hands. I want to register it and send it to..." The female employee was about to take it to weigh it and determine the postage, but the monk immediately pulled back the package, shaking his head. "Amitabha, you mustn't touch it!" As a result, a male employee wiped his hands clean with a towel and respectfully accepted the mail item.</p>
<p>Four Words, Bold and Black: Urgent!</p>
<p>After the monk left contentedly, a man who looked like a country bumpkin came staggering up to the "Express Mail" window. He had a letter in his hand, one corner of which was charred, and two trembling chicken feathers were stuck on it. He anxiously and worriedly said to the window:</p>
<p>"This is an important letter. Please be sure to send it by 'Chicken Feather Express'!"</p>
<p>The postal workers were touched by the four large, black characters "Ten Thousand Fire Urgency" on his letter. They earnestly explained that there was no longer a "Chicken Feather Express" for postal delivery, but there was airmail that could travel a thousand miles a day. He gently assured the country man that the post office would deliver the letter to its destination as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Lovers at Opposite Ends of the Earth: Where is the Beloved?</p>
<p>A letter from Gongcheng, Guangxi, had an incomplete address on the envelope: "Liu Yuxiang, No. 2424, Shanghai." There was also a letter from a Mr. Yang, perhaps a love letter. Probably because he was too nervous when writing it, the envelope only had the sweet and vague words "Miss He Xinglian, this city." Though the distance is near, it feels so far, where can these gentlemen and ladies be guided to? So these mails were all checked into a corner of the post office basement. Dark and cold, rows of rectangular wooden boxes display countless letters that have trekked over mountains and deep waters from faraway places. Inside there may be fragrant kisses from Guan Zhong, or warm comfort, anxious anticipation, or urgent appeals; now the postal workers share the fate of their reunion!</p>
<p>One Word Mistake, Searching in All Directions</p>
<p>Because of a one-word error on a letter, the post office must wander and search in the five directions of "East, South, West, North, and Center" of the seven Zhongzheng Roads and five Zhongshan Roads; or go to the "Extra-Settlement Roads" area to excavate among three road names and four house numbers; or go to Shanghai's two same-named Ningbo Roads, Huanghe Roads… to inquire; but many letters that were in critical despair are finally rescued.</p>
<p>A Bizarre Batch of Stolen Goods</p>
<p>There is also a large-scale second-hand stall in the post office. Although the source of these second-hand goods is not private property, it is indeed stolen goods. Thieves, after succeeding in the city, generously shove everything except money into the post box, as usual. So checks, keys, ID cards... flow steadily into the green lost-and-found counter every day, adding many bizarre and dazzling new "second-hand goods" to the post office. A Miss Xiang Hua from Sichuan was probably also a victim of pickpockets, so there are many photos of her and her lover here, filled with tender affection.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Green: Bamboo Announces Peace</p>
<p>An old accountant from a large Shanghai firm suddenly brought dozens of letters to post one day. The staff carefully read them and found that the dates on these letters were all from half a month ago. When asked about the reason, they learned that he had left them at home and forgotten about them for two weeks. The postal workers smiled wryly and said, "If the recipients don't know the truth, our express mailboxes, mobile post office vehicles, and all the hard work to improve the postal service will be lightly erased by him."</p>
<p>It is said that Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications once felt that the green color representing Chinese postal service was too dark and instructed it to be changed to a lighter shade. The use of green in the postal service was originally based on the phrase "Bamboo Announces Peace." Since green bamboo symbolizes peace, the postal service under the light green glow can be even more youthful in seeking progress for the convenience of the public.</p>

<p>Strange Noises from Yiyuan, "Miss International" Selected in Three Minutes</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The so-called "1947 Miss International" election dance party was finally held last night at Yiyuan. There were seven female candidates participating, representing only two nationalities. Besides the two Chinese candidates, the rest were Russian. They were listed as numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 16. Finally, it was announced that No. 4 (Zhang Yuqing) was elected first place with 8,100 votes, No. 3 (Liu Yun) was elected second place with 6,000 votes, and No. 6 (Russian nationality) was elected third place with 400 votes.</p>
<p>Advertisements for the "Miss International" election had been plastered all over the streets. It was originally scheduled to be held on the 7th of this month, but was temporarily postponed to yesterday. However, as of 10 p.m. last night, there was still no news, seemingly without any prior preparation. It was not until after 11 p.m. that the microphone announced, "The election of Miss International is about to begin, please those participating come to the stage." The contestants were coy for a long time, and then a Russian man named Petrov individually escorted them to the music stage, announced their number and name, and then Petrov supported them to walk a circle around the dance floor. The contestants were all dressed in casual clothes, with the most colorful being an Russian woman named Angel. She wore a pink linen suit trimmed with white edges, but her age made her seem unsuited. When "Miss International" walked around the dance floor, their postures were different. The most experienced walking posture was No. 6, but it was a pity that she was relatively fat and slightly limped.</p>
<p>The "Miss International" election was completed in about fifteen minutes. The audience who came to the meeting were inevitably disappointed by the perfunctory "ceremony". At five o'clock, there were a lot of opinions, strange noises were everywhere, and they dispersed in a rush.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter asked the person in charge of Yiyuan who was in charge of electing "Miss International". It was said that a Russian borrowed the venue in the name of the Twentieth Century Theater Association, which had nothing to do with the Yiyuan authorities. When asked about the total revenue of the election tickets on that day, it was said that it was still impossible to estimate. However, according to the total number of votes for the top three "Miss International" announced, which was 18,100 votes (each ticket sold for 50,000 yuan), the revenue for one night reached 905 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Liangjiang Swimming Pool: An Undersea Wrongful Death, Printing Plant Employee Drowns, the Number Thirteen is Indeed Unlucky</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiangwan Liangjiang Swimming Pool was crowded with swimmers yesterday due to the weekend holiday. A tragic drowning occurred at noon amidst the chaos. The deceased was named Lin Zongtang, 27 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, currently employed at the Central Printing Plant. Due to poor swimming skills, he unfortunately drowned. It was not discovered at first until his colleagues searched for him without success, and then someone familiar with water properties dived to the bottom of the pool and found him. By the time he was rescued from the water, his jaw was already clenched and his face was purple. It was estimated that he had been underwater for at least half an hour. Although he was given first aid and rushed to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment, he was unable to be resuscitated due to being submerged for too long. Afterwards, according to his colleagues, "There were thirteen of us here this time. At that time, we had a premonition that thirteen was an unlucky number, and now it has unfortunately come true."</p>
<h3>Zhu Qingsheng Released After Serving Sentence and Attempting Suicide</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Zhu Qingsheng theft case was previously sentenced to four months imprisonment by the District Court. He was not released after his sentence was completed, which led Zhu to attempt suicide in prison. It was previously reported that the District Prosecutor's Office had not sent the release warrant. According to investigation, it was because the case file was in the District Court and the District Prosecutor's Office was not aware of it. Therefore, it was not the responsibility of that office. It is also heard that Zhu Qingsheng was released from prison a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Mi Xichong Broadcasts on Life of Overseas Chinese in Latin America</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] This newspaper held its nineteenth special Sunday broadcast at the China Free Radio Station yesterday, inviting Mi Xichong (Guo Jian), former consul to Nicaragua in Latin America, to broadcast: "Overview of Overseas Chinese in Latin America." Mr. Mi has now been transferred to Davao City, Philippines. He has served in Latin America for twenty years. The main points of his speech are recorded below:</p>
<p>Spanish Legacy Remains</p>
<p>Latin America, geographically speaking, extends from Mexico in the north through Central America to Argentina in the south, together with Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, totaling twenty countries. Except for Haiti using French and Brazil using Portuguese, the language and writing of the other eighteen countries are mainly in Spanish. The Spanish legacy still remains today. This area is rich in resources and natural endowments. Coffee is the largest export, and other exports such as sugar from Cuba, cotton from Peru, silver from Mexico, and gold from Nicaragua also have considerable importance internationally. Overseas Chinese have been in Latin America for more than eighty years, with the largest number being Cantonese. There are more than 100,000 Overseas Chinese in Cuba, nearly 10,000 in Peru, and 2,000-3,000 or 4,000-5,000 in other countries. Overseas Chinese are engaged in many types of businesses, mostly small businesses, but there are also many engaged in farming with considerable success.</p>
<p>Various Restrictions Before the War</p>
<p>Before this war, there were 60,000 Japanese residents in Peru and 480,000 in Brazil. However, because Japan was one of the world's powers at that time, the governments of Latin American countries had complete freedom of entry for Japanese residents, but there were various restrictions on Chinese people. Their immigration laws often contained words prohibiting entry, and Overseas Chinese who had already entered were treated harshly in terms of residency procedures and general business. For example, the minimum capital requirement: those with less than the set amount were not allowed to start a business. For example, restrictions on store locations: general stores must not be freely moved without prior government approval. They can move from lively streets to remote areas, but they cannot move from quiet areas to the central city. For example, the enactment of the labor protection regulations: all employees of foreign-owned industrial and commercial enterprises must be citizens of the country in which they are located, with a ratio of either 75% or 80%. For example, the oppression suffered by Overseas Chinese education: in addition to registering with the local government as usual, the principal of an Overseas Chinese school must be a citizen of that country, and the time for teaching Chinese in some countries must not exceed six hours per week.</p>
<p>Always Enthusiastic About the Motherland</p>
<p>In short, although the number of Overseas Chinese in Latin America is not large, the capital is not large, and the business is not large, they are always enthusiastic about the motherland. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, they were able to work hard to promote the country and contribute money and effort. They enthusiastically contributed to various donations, such as medical donations, cotton clothing donations, straw shoe donations, and aviation salvation donations. They also purchased a large number of national currency public bonds, US dollar public bonds, and savings bonds, and followed the government's constitution and decree, assisting embassies and consulates at any time and anywhere with the demeanor of a great citizen to realize the work of people's diplomacy.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the embassies and consulates stationed in Latin America, in accordance with the central government's policy of resisting Japan and building the country, signed friendly treaties with the governments of the countries in which they were stationed, including Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Argentina, and Ecuador. Not only were they completely equal in principle, but there were also many improvements in the issue of entry for the people of the two contracting countries.</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Embassies and Consulates in Many Places</p>
<p>In order to enhance diplomatic relations and protect Overseas Chinese, the government has increased the number of embassies and consulates in Latin America in the past few years. Currently, there are embassies in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, and legations in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. The number of newly established consulates general and consulates is also not small.</p>
<p>The United Nations is currently the only organization for maintaining world peace. The twenty countries of Latin America are all member states of the United Nations and have considerable power and voting rights in the General Assembly, which are valued by various governments, as a matter of course.</p>

<h3>Zhou Fohai's Cousin Tang Jianhou Sued for Serving in Puppet Government Posts and Hoarding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tang Jianhou from Hunan is the cousin of the traitor Zhou Fohai. When Zhou betrayed the country, he organized the puppet Zhongbao News Agency in Nanjing as a propaganda organ. Tang joined the printing department of the agency (also known as the Xinzhong Printing Company) in 1940 as manager, and was later promoted to manager of the Zhongbao News Agency until the victory. Usually engaged in speculative hoarding, he once served as the puppet Bengbu Anti-Smoking Bureau director. The former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau sent a letter to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The Capital High Prosecutor's Office also transferred the case for joint handling based on Qiu Zhongde's accusation. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, it was found that Tang had served in the puppet Zhongbao News Agency, successively serving as the manager of the printing department and the manager of the Zhongbao News Agency. Based on Qiu Zhongde's accusation and the investigation report by the staff of the former Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, the facts are very clear. The High Court re-examined Jin Xiongbo, the deputy director of the puppet Zhongbao News Agency, who confessed that it was true. As for Tang's appointment as the director of the puppet Bengbu Anti-Smoking Bureau, Qiu Zhongde's accusation was detailed and credible. The defendant usually hoarded goods, and the description in the Handling Bureau's investigation documents was clear. His actions clearly constituted the crime of Article 3 and Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Procedure Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Lin Lan'an, the puppet Shanghai Education Bureau Director, was recently prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office.</p>

<h3>Li Mi, Commander of the Eighth Army, Who Tenaciously Defended Linqu and Completed a Great Victory</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Shao Changzhi from Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] In the great victory at Linqu, the troops under Li Mi of the Eighth Army were tenacious and unyielding, firmly defending Linqu and accomplishing their mission. Observers believe that the steadfast defense of Linqu was like the battle of Sipingjie in Shandong. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a telegram commending Li Mi, the army commander. Li's given name is Bingren. He is a native of Baoshan, Yunnan. He is currently 40 years old. He graduated from the fourth term of the Central Military Academy. He has served as platoon, company, and battalion commander. He joined the military and the Northern Expedition in 1927. He also served in political work. During the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, he was in charge of county administration and made many achievements in local administration. During the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to his military life and served as a brigade commander and deputy division commander. Later, he fought under the leadership of Chen Cheng, commander-in-chief of the Sixth War Area in western Hubei. The troops he led were the Honorary First Division, which is now famous throughout the country. At that time, he was the division commander of that division. Li was promoted to deputy army commander of the Eighth Army and commander of the Hongjiang Division Management District in Hunan due to his outstanding military achievements, where he worked to reorganize the troops. When the military situation in Yunnan and Burma became tense, the army was ordered to rush to reinforce it, resulting in the famous "Songshan Victory", which was valued by China and foreign countries. After that, he was promoted to army commander until today.</p>
<p>Li is very frugal in his personal life, and he is considerate of his subordinates. The whole army is of one heart and mind, thanks to Li's usual edification. When Li was a regimental commander under General Zhu Peide, an incident occurred. One day, General Chen Cheng received a secret order to disarm and reorganize Zhu's troops. Li learned of this news and took all the regimental troops to the Nanchang Camp to personally report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, saying that he was a student of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and was educated by him: "Revolutionary soldiers do not disarm or surrender." Therefore, he brought the troops here and asked Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to send someone to inspect and take over. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave him comfort. This also shows a glimpse of Li's personality.</p>

<h3>Flood Area Locust Suppression: Failure to Suppress Within Three Weeks Will Inevitably Extend to Neighboring Counties</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Wang Shoumei, Kaifeng, 7th] The Henan Locust Control Association reported, according to Team Leader He Jun, that the locust situation in the flood area is as follows: (A) Lian Temple area: in a 3,000 square li area, locations such as Gucheng, Jinqiao, Binwanggang, and Zhengqiao have a density of 40 to 120 locusts per square foot. (B) Xihua area: in a 1,850 square li area, locations such as Songgang, Huodangcheng, Zhangzhuang Dongdongqiao, Qinghe, Yidao, Lugang, and Zaokou have 100 locusts per square foot. (C) Honghua Ji area: in a 1,500 square li area, locations such as Liucheng, Pangang, and Nanliang have a density of 40 to 100 locusts per square foot. The most severely affected area is 6,350 square li, the moderately affected area is 3,650 square li, totaling 10,000 square li. The situation is very serious. Currently, over 50 locust control personnel are being dispatched, and approximately 150,000 civilians are being mobilized to actively control the locusts using methods such as pesticides, torn cloth bait, ditch digging, and encirclement. From July 17th to 25th, over 40,000 jin of locust nymphs were exchanged for flour, and pesticide bait and liquid were sprayed, ditches were dug, and locusts were beaten, killing an estimated 4 million jin. However, the environment in the flood area is extremely unfavorable, making the work very difficult. The locust nymphs in the flood area are in the second, third, fourth, and fifth instars. Under the principles of a permissive environment and smooth work, most can be suppressed within three weeks; otherwise, locust control personnel will be unable to enter the area. If they become flying locusts in the future, the damage to neighboring counties will be difficult to avoid. It is reported that the provincial government has urgently telegraphed various locations in the flood area, urging them to be on strict alert in order to thoroughly eliminate the locusts and prevent the harm from spreading.</p>
<p>Li Zhengang, special supervisor of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Chen Jiaxiang, technician; Guo Erpu, chief supervisor; Qiu Shibang, special commissioner; Guo Shouzhu, special commissioner; Gao Wenbin, special commissioner; and six others went to the flood area to supervise locust control and inspect the locust nymph activity. They have now returned to Bian after completing their official duties. According to them, over 700,000 jin of autumn locusts have already been collected in the flood area. However, the locust situation is still raging. In addition to the over 40 personnel sent to the area by the Henan Locust Control Committee, efforts are currently being made to capture and kill them. They are also working with various units of the Flood Area Administrative Headquarters to intensify efforts using all available locust control materials. If the environment changes favorably, the autumn locusts can all be eliminated, preventing a widespread disaster.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Military District Commander Prevents Abuses in Conscription</h3>

The most severely affected areas include Gaoqiao Town, Wangluo Town, Yingqiao Town, Huayu Township, and Yaocheng Township, covering an area of 138,864 mu. This is the most severe disaster since the Republic of China. At the same time, continuous rain caused the Ying and Ru rivers to flood, inundating the autumn crops. Moreover, the disaster-stricken areas are all tobacco-producing areas. Tobacco is the main agricultural product of Xiangcheng, and the people rely on it for their livelihoods. Now, faced with this enormous disaster, the livelihoods of the people in the entire county are on the verge of collapse. The County Council, County Party Department, Youth Corps, and County Government have attached disaster photos and detailed reports and submitted them to the Provincial Government, Provincial Council, and relevant agencies, requesting tax reductions and emergency relief.</p>

<h3>To Prevent Food Shortages and Rice Riots, Zhejiang Provincial Government Formulates Purchase and Sale Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 10th] Zhejiang Province is a grain-deficient area. Last year and this spring, food shortages led to rice riots. In order to prevent food shortages and rice riots from recurring, the provincial government has formulated a province-wide food purchase and sale plan, which has been approved by the central government. This year, it has decided to provide 70 billion in grain loans and 20 billion in collateralized loans to store 300,000 shi of grain and control food supplies. Food will be distributed in a unified manner to grain-deficient counties. If necessary, quotas will be implemented to avoid unfortunate incidents such as rice grabs.</p>

<h3>Hefei Gunshots, Wishing for a Bountiful Harvest</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch] The rice-producing areas of over thirty counties in central and eastern Anhui have recently received special blessings. During the flowering season, they were baked by high heat, growing vigorously as if pulled up by hand, and a harvest is expected that will be no less than last year's. Currently, the early rice in the polder fields is being harvested one after another, and the upland fields can also be harvested widely within two weeks. The price of rice has fallen from nearly 300,000 per shi to 200,000, and in some villages, it has fallen to 140,000 to 150,000. In recent nights, the suburbs of Hefei have been filled with the sound of crackling gunfire, as dense as a string of pearls. Many residents in the city were startled awake from their sleep, not understanding what was happening. After investigation, it was learned that it was the rural areas competing to fire earthen guns to celebrate the green signs of a bountiful harvest, and only then did they understand and smile.</p>

<h3>Tuition and Fees for Specialized Schools and Above in this City Have Been Initially Decided: Highest at 2 Million, Lowest at 1.4 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Federation of Specialized Schools and Above held its 11th regular meeting at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Attendees included Fudan President Zhang Yi, Jiaotong University's Wang Zhizhuo, Tongji's Xi Fan, Daxia's Ou Yuanhuai, St. John's Tu Yuqing, Shanghai Jiang's Lin Zhuoran, Zhijiang's Wang Yukai, Shanghai Law School's Zhu Fengyi, Lixin Accounting School's Pan Xulun, Shanghai Conservatory of Music's Dai Cuilun, Aurora University's Hu Wenyao, Shanghai Medical College's Gu Jingyi, Tongde Medical College's Gu Yuqi, Southeast Medical College's Chen Chongchen, Sino-French Pharmaceutical College's Wu Yuwan, Datong's Hu Dunfu, National Defense Medical College's Zhang Jian, Wuxi National College's Tang Wenzhi, Shanghai College of Political Science and Law's Guo Xiaoxian, China Vocational School of Industry and Commerce's Shen Sizhuang, Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts' Liu Haisu, Chengming College of Arts and Sciences' Jiang Weiqiao, Municipal Vocational College's Yang Shuyi, China New College's Chen Gaoyong, Guanghua's Shen Jinguo, and Shanghai Dental College's Situ Bo, and twenty others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang Yi first reported that a letter was sent to the Shanghai Poor Student Aid Committee to raise funds, and a reply has been received indicating agreement and a commitment to do its best to allocate funds. (2) Guanghua University previously proposed sending a letter to the Municipal Government to exempt various schools from property donations and municipal construction donations. This letter was sent at the end of last month. Immediately afterwards, discussion began on important issues such as tuition fees, professor salaries, and student aid fundraising for the next semester. Representatives from various private schools reported on the tuition fees and professor salaries in their respective schools.</p>
<p>Schools' Opinions</p>
<p>Lixin's Pan Xulun stated that the school plans to charge 1.5 million in tuition next semester. Professor salaries have always been adjusted according to national schools. If the tuition fee is too low, it will not be possible to increase tuition fees midway, and professor salaries cannot be adjusted. As for students, the academic performance of private school students is not inferior. Therefore, scholarships should be set up as much as possible so that poor students can study. Shanghai Jiang's Lin Zhuoran stated that the school plans to charge tuition fees between 1.5 million and 2 million. Daxia's Ou Yuanhuai stated that high tuition fees mean that students' parents cannot afford them, and the number of students decreases. Low tuition fees mean that schools have difficulty operating, and professor salaries cannot be adjusted. Therefore, a reasonable solution must be found that takes both into account. St. John's Tu Yuqing stated that his school, Zhijiang, and Soochow have made preliminary decisions to charge 1.2 million for tuition and 300,000 for miscellaneous fees, a threefold increase compared to last semester. Zhijiang's Wang Yukai cited Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau's current speech on the issue of tuition fees, stating that teacher salaries and school fees should be based on rice prices. Shanghai College of Political Science and Law's Guo Xiaoxian stated that students who received scholarships in the school last semester accounted for a quarter of the total number of students in the school. If the number of scholarships in each school increases, it will help solve the above problems. Shanghai Law School's Chu Fengyi stated that he hoped to refrain from making rigid regulations for the time being.</p>
<p>Discussion Results</p>
<p>After several detailed discussions, the following was decided: (1) Taking into account both the affordability of students' parents and the reasonable salaries that professors should have, a preliminary decision was made: the minimum tuition fee for each school next semester is 1.4 million, and the maximum must not exceed 2 million. (2) The number of scholarships in each school: full exemptions must not be less than 10%, and half exemptions must not be less than 20%. (3) A permanent scholarship committee will be established to promote fundraising work. Fudan, Lixin, Datong, St. John's, Shanghai Jiang's, Academy of Fine Arts, Tongji, Tongde Medical College, Guanghua, and Jiaotong University were designated as members, and Fudan will convene them to plan concrete implementation measures. No decision was made on the issue of professor salaries for the time being.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The committee held a first meeting discussing concrete fundraising methods on the afternoon of the thirteenth.</p>
<h3>Wuhan University's Architecture and Medical College to be Conducted in Cooperation with UNRRA Commissioners: Entire Project to Take Five Years to Complete</h3>

<h3>Taiwan Education Agency Unifies Printing and Sales of Textbooks</h3>
<p>Shanghai Booksellers Express Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] The Taiwan Provincial Department of Education has recently established a Textbook Supply Committee to centrally plan the printing and distribution of textbooks. The committee entrusted the Provincial Education Association to sell the textbooks at the lowest cost, cutting out middlemen and merchants, in order to reduce the burden on students. 2.5 million copies of textbooks in various subjects have been printed, but this is still not enough to meet the actual needs.</p>
<p>[Our City Dispatch] There are five Shanghai booksellers that have set up branches in Taiwan, including Zhengzhong, Kaiming, Children, Duli, and Shengli. Recently, Zhonghua and Commercial Press have also set up distribution centers in Taiwan, intending to work for the culture of Taiwan Province. However, since the province was reorganized into a provincial government, most of the controls have been abolished. Now, the unified sale of textbooks, which are related to freedom of publication, is akin to competing with booksellers for profit. Shanghai booksellers have expressed dissatisfaction. The only solution is for the branches of various companies that are working hard for the culture of Taiwan Province to completely withdraw from Taiwan Province to avoid being said to be engaged in business.</p>

<h3>The Predicament of Education in the Former Capital</h3>
<p>— Our Ping-based Correspondent Song Shaobo</p>
<p>Reading and teaching have become difficult problems to remedy at present.</p>
<p>As the national crisis deepens daily, the education problem becomes even more severe. Today, when discussing education, everyone barely has time to consider the system, faculty, and facilities. The only things that trouble teachers and students daily are their livelihoods. Teachers teach to earn a living, and students apply to schools, choosing their targets not based on the quality of the school, but on how much it costs. This situation is particularly evident in Beiping.</p>
<p>The problem of Beiping students being unable to attend school seems even more worrying this year. In the past, the main reason students could not attend school was that there were few schools and many students. Some students wanted to study but couldn't because they couldn't get into a school. The situation today is different. While the scarcity of schools is still a reason for students being unable to attend, the main problem is that students who already had access to schools and could afford to study are now dropping out in batches. Widespread unemployment and the expansion of war zones are only exacerbating this situation, increasing daily. When people talk about it, they say, "We can barely feed the family, how can we afford to study?" Everyone wants their children who have had some schooling to find work, which further intensifies the panic about unemployment.</p>
<p>In the past, students who were admitted to national colleges and universities could mostly sustain themselves because of public funding. However, according to the Ministry of Education's order, starting in the 36th year (1947), public funding for incoming freshmen has been canceled and replaced with scholarships. According to this method, the percentage of students eligible for public funding (scholarships) has been reduced from 80% to 25% (and there are also restrictions on academic performance and conduct). According to statistics, so-called poor students account for almost 90% of the total student population. They had all originally relied on public funding, but now more than 60% of them will have to drop out of school. This is a serious blow to this year's incoming freshmen. To this end, the preparatory class students of various national universities in Beiping have formed a "Joint Association to Fight for the Continuation of the Public Funding System for Universities" to demand that the Ministry of Education maintain the original method. They believe that since the country has restored the wartime system, logically, the public funding established during wartime should not be canceled. In addition, the Ministry of Education stipulates that public funding will be suspended for those who fail one-third of their credits, which is also a fatal blow to some students who are not doing well in some subjects. After negotiation, Tsinghua University has allowed such students to enjoy half public funding, but Peking University has not yet responded.</p>
<p>The number of students whose families are in communist areas and have had their economic resources cut off is increasing daily. These students, except for a few who study at national universities and receive public funding, have almost no choice but to drop out of school. Some seek employment, but if they cannot find employment, they have to go home. They believe that the government's lip service to winning over young people without solving the problems of these young students is a major blunder. Now, some students who are determined not to return to the communist areas have also organized student associations to seek the same treatment as students in border areas and demobilized soldiers. Some self-funded students must find a guarantor who can pay their meal fees before they can enroll (such as at Tsinghua University), otherwise, they will be refused admission.</p>
<p>The tuition fees for private universities next semester are at least 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Besides the few wealthy children, plus the monthly meal fees, it is really not something that an ordinary family can afford. Some are taking advantage of the summer vacation to do hard labor. For example, at Yenching University, which is known as a school for the elite, many students are dismantling walls and removing military equipment for the school to earn 2,000 yuan per hour. A few other students have received self-help work from the International Christian Student Relief Association, working six hours a day and earning 500,000 yuan a month doing clerical work. Some have formed their own tutoring schools and temporarily collect some tuition fees. Some students at private universities who cannot find a solution do not hesitate to lower their grade level and apply to national university freshmen to save some money. This time, the joint enrollment of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University found many such cases. The three schools can only accommodate 2,000 people in total, and the total number of applicants in the Beiping examination area alone is more than 5,000. How easy is it to hope to attend a free school? How many of those who fail the exam can afford to attend private universities? It's a real question.</p>
<p>The situation for middle school students is even more difficult because even if they are admitted to municipal middle schools and pay a few tuition fees, they must pay for their own meals. Because the tuition fees for municipal middle schools are low (30,000 to 50,000 yuan), everyone comes to apply. This year, Beiping's municipal high schools admitted a total of 986 people, and junior high schools admitted 1,230 people, but there were 25,786 applicants, an average of one out of fourteen being admitted. How many of the remaining 23,000 can afford to attend private middle schools with tuition fees of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan? Moreover, some private middle schools require tuition and meal fees to be paid in full at the time of enrollment to avoid trouble, but how many families can raise 1 to 2 million yuan at once to pay for children who may or may not be able to study?</p>
<p>According to the report from the Ping Municipal Education Bureau, 40% of Beiping's children aged 6 to 12 are out of school. The daily work of these out-of-school children is to pick coal cinders and sell newspapers, working as child laborers. The Education Bureau planned to increase schools and classes by 3 billion yuan after the summer vacation last semester, but the Ministry of Education did not approve it.</p>
<p>The incident a few days ago in which Jin Chengyi, a Tsinghua University student, stabbed a professor out of resentment for failing his grade for fear of losing public funding, is a tragic illustration of this serious problem.</p>
<p>On the teacher's side, the phenomenon of exclusion is also present. In some municipal middle schools, because there are too many personnel, batches of teachers and principals are being squeezed out. What follows is mutual exposure of scandals, which is both laughable and infuriating. When the war in the Northeast reached a confused state, professors fled to the south. To solve the problem of eating, everyone had to manage. Deans and directors did not hesitate to lower their positions, and several people were squeezed out again. Those who can find a way abroad are competing to seek opportunities to go abroad. Professors who should have returned to China this summer after lecturing abroad are mostly unwilling to return. A few days ago, professors from various national colleges and universities jointly wrote a letter to Hu Shi, asking Hu to think of ways to improve their treatment with the government. Can Hu Shi come up with a solution? This is certainly not a simple question.</p>

<h3>South China Holds Pre-Departure Ceremony: Defeats Navy 5-1; Little Li Huitang Scores Two Goals in the Second Half</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Airmail] The two football teams are preparing for tours, and the preparations have reached a mature stage. The team will depart on the 18th of this month, and the destinations will be Annam, Rangoon, and Manila. They are scheduled to return to Hong Kong before September to participate in the league. Li Huitang and his "true successor" - Li Ziyu De, are both participating in the expedition. The personnel are generally finalized as follows:</p>
<p>Leader: Chen Jingtao, Secretary She Meide, Captain Ji Chongtang, Players: (Goalkeeper) Tan Jun'gan, (Defenders) Zeng Zhongyun, Li Guowei, Lin Rushun, (Midfielders) Liu Rongguang, Kong Qingyu, Xie Jinhong, Luo Weiquan, (Forwards) Li Huitang, Li Deqi, Li Shuoyou, Li Yude, Xie Jinhe, Chen Dehui, Zhuo Shijin.</p>
<p>In order to review the strength of the Southern Expedition team, they arranged a match with the Navy team at Jiashan on the 3rd (Sunday). The Navy team had defeated China United in a charity match, so yesterday's match attracted many fans. The match started in the rain. South China was personally supervised by Li Yingtang, and won by three goals in the first half, with the credit going to Jinhe, Shijin, and Shuoyou. In the second half, Yude came on and Deqi retired. "Little Li" showed great promise, scoring two goals alone. The Navy also pulled one back, making it 5-1 at the end of the match. South China's lineup that day:</p>
<p>Translator Jun Gan</p>
<p>Lin Rushun Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan Xie Jinhong Kong Qingyu</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou Zhuo Shijin Li Huitang Li Yongde (down) Li De (up) Xie Jinhe</p>
<p>Overall, Jun Gan's goalkeeping has not returned to its original form and is not a good general. Left-back Lin Rushun is even less worthy of mention. The midfield line can defend, but the assist is not enough. It is not easy to cooperate with a frontline that lacks energy to compete for the ball in midfield. If they encounter a strong team, it is not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Obstacles to the Reception of the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium: The Building is So Damaged That It is Almost Impossible to Start; Barracks are Covered with New Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Municipal Stadium in Shanghai was borrowed by the Joint Logistics Headquarters after the victory. It was originally scheduled to be completely returned by the end of June this year for repairs to prepare for the 7th National Games. However, it failed to materialize for some reason. After repeated negotiations, the Joint Logistics Headquarters ordered the Shanghai Port Headquarters to return it immediately, and the stadium was ordered to take over. In order to discuss the handover procedures, Stadium Director Jiang Xiangqing visited Director He Shoulin of the Ordnance Department of the Port Headquarters on the 4th and 5th of this month. The results were satisfactory. After the negotiation, the Port Headquarters prepared to return it on the 7th. In order to expedite the handover procedures, Director Jiang, together with Director He, Deputy Director Xu, and Chen Meinian, the warehouse director of the Second Ordnance Supply Depot of the Joint Logistics Department, visited Jiangwan again at 9 am on the 8th to survey the entire site and buildings and to discuss specific handover methods. The following agreement was reached: (1) The municipal stadium, which was half destroyed by bombing, can be exchanged around the 15th of this month after the two parties exchange documents. (2) The Shanghai Municipal Stadium, the Municipal Swimming Pool, and other buildings will be returned successively. (3) There are still a large number of dangerous goods in the destroyed area that are pressed at the bottom. The municipal government should send a letter to the Engineering Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters to send sappers to assist in the removal. The current situation of the stadium is described below:</p>
<p>Everywhere Devastated</p>
<p>Except for the municipal stadium, the other buildings are currently in a state that cannot be transferred within two or three months. The first floor of the Shanghai Municipal Stadium has been completely dismantled by enemy soldiers, and the interior has also been severely damaged. The sewers around the building are all blocked, and the inside of the stadium is flooded after every heavy rain. The condition of the swimming pool and buildings is even worse. Although the machine room is still largely intact, one of the water pumps has lost its cover. The track and field inside the municipal stadium is equivalent to the mountainous areas of the western and southern provinces. If you want to find the track, you have to dig several feet deep. Some of the mounds and rocks are six or seven feet high. Most of the plane has been covered by gravel, iron sheets, and scattered cement bones. Weeds grow wildly, and trees are lush. As for the half that has been bombed, there is little hope of rebuilding it in five or six years. Even the cost of clearing it will be staggering, because the steel and cement blocks of broken bricks cannot be moved by manpower. Looking around, it is almost impossible to start. The most troublesome thing is that there are still a considerable number of tons of dangerous goods pressed at the bottom. If they are cleared by ordinary engineering personnel, there will be another explosion. If the sappers are responsible for clearing them, it seems appropriate to do so before the takeover, otherwise, no one will be responsible in the future.</p>
<p>Full of New Recruits</p>
<p>All the houses in the undamaged part of the municipal stadium have been cleared, but they have been used as reception centers for new recruits. Currently, there are 3,000 people living there, and the corridors are also crowded. According to reports, batches of new recruits are arriving, and it is said that another 7,000 people will arrive successively in the coming days. The New Recruit Reception Committee, because there is no place to put its feet in all the houses, has built temporary houses on the field for accommodation. Construction is currently underway, and it is also planned to repair the road of the municipal swimming pool and use it as a place for new recruits to bathe. According to Director Jiang, the reception of the municipal stadium is no longer a problem, but there is nothing to be gained, and the staff who go to the reception as soon as possible also need to build more temporary houses to have a place to stay. Jiang has reported the above situation to Deputy Director Li of the Education Bureau (Director Gu is lecturing in Taiwan) and has asked the municipal government for instructions. The compensation for the bombed part has been 1 billion yuan, and it has been collected by the Public Works Bureau, which is enough to excavate the runway, renovate the field, lay turf, and carry out some sporadic repairs.</p>

<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Holds General Meeting of Members Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Artificial Silk Allocation</h3>
<p>Resolution to Submit Four Demands to the Central Trust Bureau</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association held a temporary general meeting of members in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning. Zhou Lianze, a representative of the Municipal Social Bureau, Pan Shihao, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chen Wujie, a representative of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, Tian Heqing, a representative of the Industrial Association, and representatives of more than 300 member units of the association attended. Silk weaving factories from Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shengze also sent representatives to attend. Cai Tingtao served as the chairman of the meeting, which lasted until 12 noon.</p>
<p>The focus of yesterday's meeting was to discuss the issue of artificial silk allocation by the Central Trust Bureau (CTB). During the meeting, the emotions of the members were very intense. Silk weaving factories are currently facing difficult times, and the supply of raw materials is extremely difficult. Taking the artificial silk allocated by the CTB as an example, the allocation source has been announced, forcing the factories to resort to the black market. Even when the CTB allocated the most, it was less than one-fifth of the industry's needs. Now the allocation price has been raised to be equal to the black market price, making the factories feel that every step is difficult. At present, the products of the factories are slow-selling and the prices are stagnant. On the one hand, labor costs and other expenses have to be paid regularly. The factories feel negative about the issue of continuing to maintain operations. However, on the other hand, because the factories employ a large number of workers, closing down is not permissible in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers. The factories feel that they are in a dilemma.</p>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, the representatives of the factories expressed their unwillingness to continue operating and their emotions were high. Fortunately, Pan Shihao of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others earnestly persuaded them, and the atmosphere began to ease. After a discussion on the issue of artificial silk allocation by the CTB, four resolutions were obtained:</p>
<p>The General Assembly Resolved Four Requests</p>
<p>(1) Request the CTB to determine the allocation price of artificial silk in accordance with the nationally stipulated profit margin. According to the nationally stipulated general profit, it should be based on the actual cost (it is reported that the cost price of each box of artificial silk at the CTB is 190 US dollars) plus a legal profit percentage.</p>
<p>(2) If the CTB believes that the silk weaving industry has the suspicion of allocating at low prices and selling at high prices on the black market, it can allocate the raw materials to the silk weaving industry in a 代织 (contract weaving) manner, have the industry 代织 finished products, and then purchase them. The industry only charges legal labor costs.</p>
<p>(3) Request the CTB to organize an artificial silk allocation committee. The members of the committee should include representatives from the municipal government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and the Silk Weaving Industry Association in addition to the CTB, so as to openly handle the issue of artificial silk allocation.</p>
<p>(4) Request the CTB to improve the artificial silk allocation method. The current allocation method of the CTB is that after determining the quota at 10 am every Monday, the payment must be made at 11 am, and the storage order can be obtained four or five days later. It takes at least one week for the goods to arrive. Please improve it so that the storage order can be obtained and the goods can be shipped immediately after payment, so as to avoid cost increase due to interest loss on payment.</p>
<p>Elected Representatives to Visit the Mayor</p>
<p>Finally, Cai Xiji, Liu Qingyi, and others were elected as representatives to go to the Municipal Government at 10 am today in response to Mayor Wu's invitation in order to personally present everything.</p>
<p>[Further News] It is reported that the allocation price of artificial silk for this week by the CTB has been determined by the bureau after consulting with the heads of various departments last Saturday, referring to the market conditions of last week, to be 22.3 million yuan per box.</p>
<h3>CTB Organizes Loans for Increased Edible Oil Production, Including Four Types: Soybeans, Sesame, Rapeseed</h3>
<p>In order to promote the increased production of edible oil and to cooperate with the general mobilization order plan, the CTB has, according to the 四联总处 (Four Joint Offices), through the material loan method passed in the last board meeting, summoned the relevant lines局 (bureaus) and oil pressing industry institutions last week to exchange preliminary opinions. It was generally agreed that since the principles of the Four Joint Offices have been established, the implementation rules should be followed and implemented quickly. The CTB and the Third District Plant Oil Refining Industry will jointly discuss and decide on all the details to be released on Tuesday (the 12th). This edible oil production increase loan includes four types of raw materials: soybeans, peanuts, sesame, and rapeseed. The procurement work will be carried out in a unified manner, and the storage and transportation of finished products will also be considered. Therefore, it will be of great benefit to domestic production and consumption in the future.</p>
<p>Increase Production</p>
<p>Recently, the supply of edible oil in the city has been rising due to various reasons. Now the Zhongzhi Oil Factory has shipped 3,000 barrels of soybean oil from Qingdao to Shanghai, which are being valued for sale. The factory has also been ordered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to increase the production of edible oil by 20,000 dan per month. The CTB delivered 2,300 tons of soybeans to the oil pressing factories last month, which were refined in 代制 (contract processing) manner. Last week, another 3,700 tons of soybeans were unloaded in Shanghai, and it is planned to entrust each factory to refine them in a 代制 manner after the contract is signed. Combining with the previous 6,000 tons in total, the handling fee may be increased by 50% from the previous 20,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Abundant Raw Materials</p>
<p>This year's oil pressing raw materials are estimated to be abundant by all parties. Therefore, the CTB is currently auditing the output of various types of oil pressing raw materials in China. In addition to considering domestic needs, it is prepared for quantitative export. According to the estimates of knowledgeable people in the oil pressing industry, the soybean output in the Northeast last year reached 122,600,000 hu, and the output in various parts of Guan Nei (areas inside the passes) totaled 166,600,000 hu. This year, except for the losses caused by the war, all parts of the country can be expected to harvest.</p>
<p>Export Difficulties</p>
<p>Merchants from the Eastern Nine Provinces have shipped several batches of goods to various European countries and the Soviet Union. However, due to the unstable political situation and transportation difficulties in the Allied countries, the production and sales of soybeans have not been able to return to normal, so the number of overseas sales is not large. At present, Allied countries want to restore the normal state before the war, but there are many difficulties. According to general estimates, the amount of soybean exports from China within the areas controlled by the National Army this year will not exceed 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 tons. Even after the restoration of full peace in the Eastern Nine Provinces, the demand for soybeans in Guan Nei in China is very high. Unless there is a significant increase in production, the amount of soybeans exported abroad will not reach the pre-war level.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Gold Seized En Route to Macau in Manila</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila, 10th] It is reported that Philippine Treasury Department detectives yesterday prevented 25,000 ounces of gold (worth US$1,279,000) from being transported from Manila to Macau by air. Although local exporters held gold export permits from the Foreign Exchange Control Administration, Philippine Finance Minister Goteano announced that these permits expired on July 18. All applications from merchants to extend the gold export permits were rejected by Goteano in order to comply with the International Monetary Fund's regulations, which stipulate that gold sales must not exceed US$35 per ounce.</p>
<p>Currently, the price of gold in Macau is above US$51 per ounce, attracting smugglers like moths to a flame. Gold flows from Macau into the Chinese black market. At a recent cabinet meeting, the Philippine cabinet discussed the gold issue, and Goteano reiterated the Philippines' obligations under international monetary agreements. Presidential Secretary Abejero stated that the Philippines is investigating in Washington the intention of U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder's recent statement, in which Snyder said that the U.S. does not oppose the re-export of gold imported into Canada for refining.</p>
<h3>Diesel Oil Industry Writes to the National Economic Commission, Requesting Relaxation of Diesel Oil Quota</h3>
<p>Due to the perceived shortage of diesel oil in the third-period quota of the Transport Control Commission, the quota was uniquely increased by more than 7 million US dollars in order to ensure a universal supply of diesel oil and prevent the resurgence of the black market. In the past, privately-owned industries could procure the diesel fuel they needed from various oil companies, but in recent months, due to reduced supply, oil companies have refused to sell. To survive, private industries have been forced to turn to the black market, where prices are more than four times the controlled price. The government originally approved an increase of more than 7 million US dollars in the third-period quota. The amount of the increase is too small, and the diesel oil industry has now written to the National Economic Commission, requesting a greater increase.</p>
<h3>Production of Sanitary Materials and Supplies - No Technical Problems; Imports Should Apparently Be Prohibited Due to Foreign Competition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to statistics from the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, sanitary materials can be broadly classified into rubber plasters, cotton gauze, cloth tape, and other types. Ten years ago, our country mostly relied on imported goods. In 1935, the Xinyi Factory established a rubber plaster factory. In 1937, the Xin Ya Sanitary Material Factory was established to specialize in the production of Xing brand rubber plaster. The above two factories each produce 15,000 rolls per month (each roll 12 x 5 yards). In 1939, Xin Ya expanded its scope, adding weaving, degreasing, and bleaching equipment to manufacture degreased gauze, cotton, cloth tape, and the like. Other factories, such as Tianping, Datong, Huisheng, Xinhua, and Kuaile, manufacture cotton and gauze. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the supply of sanitary materials to the rear was mostly transported from this city via Hong Kong, the Yunnan-Burma Road, and eastern Zhejiang into the interior. Since the victory, the industry has been greatly affected by large quantities of American relief goods and surplus sanitary materials coming into China, as the domestic manufacturing costs are too high for effective competition.</p>
<p>Currently, the manufacturers of rubber plasters include Xinyi, Xin Ya, Tianping, and other factories. Those who manufacture gauze include Xin Ya, Datong, Huisheng, and other factories. The manufacturers of cotton include Datong, Huisheng, Xin Ya, Xinhua, Kuaile, and other factories. Except for cotton, the current production volume of rubber plasters and gauze is far from the maximum production volume, some as low as 20-30%. The Guidance Office believes that the manufacturing of sanitary materials no longer has technical problems and that the equipment is simple, making it very easy to increase production when needed. Since domestic products can be adequately supplied, imports should apparently be prohibited.</p>
<h3>National Bank Dispatches Two Auditors to Supervise the Liquidation of Ba Chuan and Zheng He</h3>
<p>According to a responsible person from the National Bank yesterday, after the Shanghai branches of Ba Chuan and Zheng He stopped exchanging currency, the Ministry of Finance revoked the business licenses of both banks in accordance with the Financial Control Measures. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the National Bank's Auditing Department, instructing them to supervise the liquidation of the two banks. After receiving the order, the National Bank appointed auditors Shen and Yu on the 10th to proceed to the above two banks to handle the liquidation matters.</p>
<p>The total amount of liabilities for the two banks is 15 billion yuan, including ordinary deposits and interbank lending. The liquidation process will first repay the normal deposits, and then liquidate interbank lending. It is expected that this work can be completed within two months.</p>
<p>It was also stated that the branches of the two banks outside of Shanghai will continue to operate as usual. Recently, the money supply in Shanghai has eased, so the liquidation of the two banks will not affect the local market.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Weak and Depressed</h3>
<p>Market conditions are mostly weak and sluggish, except for Sichuan currency and Tianjin currency, which remain firm. Imported and Guangdong goods once rose due to bandit-related disturbances. Guangdong benzoin reached 120,000 yuan. Compared with Hankou, the price difference with Shanghai is almost half, so people are going to Hankou to buy it. Sales in local pharmacies are sluggish, leading to a further lack of sales. Guangdong Costus Root has now fallen below the 100,000 yuan mark, even quoted at 80,000 yuan, and Indian Costus Root has also been affected. Taichang musk, nearing the expiration of its sales order, has fallen to 28,000 yuan. Sandalwood rice has fallen to 32,000 yuan, with very few transactions, and confidence is very weak.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Rubber Trade</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 10th] The Hong Kong rubber trade is experiencing unprecedented prosperity. In the first half of the year, 241,300 piculs of raw rubber were imported and 159,800 piculs were exported. The imported rubber came from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. On the export side, except for 5,000 piculs shipped to the United States, the remaining 150,000 piculs were shipped to our country.</p>
<h3>Our Country Should Urgently Develop the South American Market for Silk Fabrics and Can Largely Replace Japan's Original Position</h3>
<p>Since the war, the United States has become a competitive market for silk-producing countries around the world. Japanese silk shipments to the United States have substantial inventories, and the production volume of American nylon is astonishing. All of these factors make China's raw silk face strong competitors for export, resulting in an oversupply of raw silk in the United States and a sharp drop in market prices. The silk industry in our country is paying close attention to this issue. It is estimated that the government will purchase 14,000 dan of raw silk this spring, and autumn silkworms are about to be hatched. The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee and the Silk Fabric Export Coordination Committee are both anticipating these materials will be used for export or manufactured into satins for re-export, and are devising appropriate policies.</p>
<p>It is reported that related parties recently received reports from qualified individuals in the South American silk industry, stating that Chinese businesses are too negligent in this area. The reason for this is the long distance and the lack of direct contact. Regular orders are often relayed through the United States by mail, which takes no less than two or three months, and shipping takes even longer. However, there are still many good opportunities to expand the development of domestic goods, for the following reasons: (1) South American countries did not suffer losses during World War II. On the contrary, they absorbed a lot of foreign exchange due to increased wartime trade, and their purchasing power has increased. (2) Before the war, Japanese goods were dumped in the region and gained a considerable position. The preference for Japanese goods has not completely disappeared, especially for silk products and satins. In this period of sluggish sales of British raw silk, it is possible to change course, open new avenues, and dump silk finished products in the region to replace Japan's original position.</p>
<p>Based on the above factors, our country has been negligent, so the active expansion of the market in the region is being handled by British, French, and Italian merchants. Their marketing methods even use the "Chinese goods" label or refer to them as mixed Japanese goods, rarely directly stating they are European products. Although sales are not entirely satisfactory, the market is attracting attention, as can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The person reporting also suggested improving the approach by urging our country to quickly organize an inspection tour to South America, bringing finished products, in addition to the main silk fabrics and satins, as well as porcelain, lacquerware, and embroidery, to attract the attention of the people there and restore the trend of loving Chinese goods. In addition, it may be worthwhile to imitate Italy's approach to selling silk satin in the region, that is, send finished products to the region for exhibition. As a result, the goods were completely sold out, and import taxes were avoided.</p>
<h3>More Than 200 Types of Cotton Fabrics to Be Shipped to Southeast Asia Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Textile Production and Sales Joint Corporation, in order to actively promote trade in Southeast Asia, convened an important joint meeting the other night to discuss issues related to exports to Southeast Asia. It was decided that: (1) 268 types of products that have been reviewed and approved for export will be selected, and a number of dozens of each type will be shipped by the company itself to various parts of Southeast Asia tomorrow (12th). (2) Chen Youjun will be appointed to represent the company and will go to Southeast Asia immediately to handle sales matters. (3) The company will request relevant government agencies to provide raw materials and loans so that the factories affiliated with the company can start producing export products as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is also learned that overseas Chinese importers in Southeast Asia have been sending letters and telegrams to inquire about the establishment of the company. Recently, they plan to send representatives to Shanghai one after another to formally negotiate and place orders with the company. It is also learned that the chairman of the Philippine Importers Association will be coming to Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Three Batches of Rapeseed, Estimated at 10 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau's purchase of rapeseed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to increase rapeseed oil production, of which the first and second batches have arrived in Shanghai one after another, totaled approximately 100,000 dan by the 9th, including approximately 30,000 dan from the Pinghu area, 25,000 dan from Wuhu, and 40,000 dan from Suzhou. The total amount is approximately 25 billion yuan. In order to help the government secure a large quantity of essential daily necessities, in addition to continuing to purchase the remaining rapeseed from the above three regions, the bureau will also include Zhujiajiao in the purchase area, and it is estimated that the total amount for the third batch of purchases will be approximately 10 billion yuan. After this work is completed, the purchase will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Scented Tea in Dire Straits Due to Stagnant Tea Sales</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th] Fuzhou's famous scented tea is currently in the production season, but due to the recent stagnation of tea sales, tea merchants are unwilling to cultivate it, and more than 100,000 tea farmers, flower farmers, and tea workers who depend on it for their livelihoods are in dire straits.</p>
<p>Fuzhou scented tea used to have a large export volume before the war, and sales to the northeastern and northern provinces accounted for the largest share of domestic tea sales. According to statistics, in 1933, Fuzhou's total export value of scented tea reached more than 140,000 piculs, worth more than 60 million yuan. Production and sales declined during the war, and flower farmers removed flower plants and switched to growing grain, and tea merchants went bankrupt. The former prosperity of "flowers as white as snow, fragrance spreading for miles, and tea shops lining the streets with boats like weaving shuttles" has become a historical trace.</p>
<p>After the victory, the scented tea market became active again, and last year tea shops rushed to produce it, hoping to make a huge profit. However, the total output of various scented flowers last year was only more than 7,000 dan. As a result of competitive purchasing, flower prices soared, so the cost of scented tea suddenly increased. In addition, the turmoil caused by the Communist bandits in North China affected sales, which stagnated.</p>
<p>According to investigations, the use of scented flowers to process tea leaves in Fuzhou has been going on for nearly a hundred years. Initially, people from Changle brought jasmine flower seeds back to their hometown from Guangzhou, and planted them for their pure white color and rich fragrance, exclusively for viewing and selling and for women's decoration.</p>
<p>During the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty, a merchant from Beijing, Wang Zhengda, brought snuff to Changle and discovered that jasmine flowers had an excellent aftertaste. Tea merchants in Changle then used jasmine flower tea, and sales increased significantly. Tea merchants from Gutian followed suit, and the scented tea manufacturing industry became increasingly popular, leading to a shortage of scented flowers. Farmers in various villages in Fuzhou saw the benefits and planted them one after another. Moreover, due to Fuzhou's convenient transportation and developed trade, tea shops gradually concentrated, making it the main producing area of scented tea.</p>
<p>Subsequently, tea shops began to use various scented flowers to try scenting tea leaves, and it was determined that pomelo flowers, pearl orchids, magnolias, jade orchids, water gardenias, and hawksbill flowers could all be used for scenting, but those made with jasmine and pearl orchid were sold at a better price. Scented tea is divided into two types: "熏" (xun, smoked) and "提" (ti, infused). "熏" refers to removing the residual flowers and then roasting it again, while "提" refers to removing the flowers without roasting. The more times it is smoked, the deeper the flower fragrance penetrates into the tea. After brewing, the fragrance is fragrant and refreshing.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Tea Industry Declines; Several Tea Shops Have Closed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou Dispatch, 9th] Hangzhou's tea market this year is weak in sales and difficult to bear the heavy profits. Moreover, the commodity tax has been repeatedly increased, making it difficult to make progress. Due to sparse business in the city, several companies have announced their closure, including Lian Pei Tea Shop, Deda Xin Tea Shop, Tongtai Xiang Hangzhou Branch, Weng Qitai Tea Shop, and Wu Yongtai Tea Zhuang.</p>
<h3>National Treasury Bureau Moves to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The head office of the Central Bank has been ordered to move to Nanjing to work. The National Treasury Bureau was the first to move. The first batch of staff from the bureau moved to Nanjing to work on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of this month, bringing their office supplies. The director of the bureau, Xiong, and the deputy director, Yu Zhuang, have already gone to Nanjing ahead of schedule, and have established more than 500 sections in Nanjing, including revenue and expenditure accounting, remittance, and documents. The remaining parts are also actively preparing.</p>
<h3>Riding Breeches Cloth Offered at Low Prices</h3>
<p>The retail sale and custom tailoring of woolen fabrics were still quiet yesterday. However, jobbers showed some activity. Old goods were being cleared, and autumn and winter goods were successively put on the market. The prices of "Zhenshi" (genuine) woolen cloth and broadcloth have improved a lot since buyers from Sichuan, Changsha, and Xi'an procured them last week, and the market remained firm yesterday. Riding breeches cloth and camel cashmere were also discussed at recent tea gatherings, and their prices were far cheaper than Zhenshi woolen cloth. (In the past, riding breeches cloth was priced alongside Zhenshi woolen cloth, and sometimes even exceeded it.) Consignment sales were quoted at less than 500,000 yuan. The reason for this is that the popularity of Melton overcoats and long robes has led to a sharp decrease in the actual sales of riding breeches cloth and camel cashmere overcoats.</p>

<h3>U.S. Wood Oil Consumption Soars</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 8th] According to Logan, president of the Pinghe Vegetable Oil Company, a major U.S. tung oil importer, U.S. tung oil consumption has soared, with the amount of tung oil used to make paint currently reaching 7 million pounds per month. The consumption of tung oil for a whole year before the war was only 12 million pounds. According to the Department of Commerce, the value of tung oil loaded and unloaded at various wharves in San Francisco this year is more than US$5.1 million, which is more than the total imports for the entire year of 1946.</p>

<h3>Chinese Modern Women Writers' Novel Collection - Preface to "Untitled Collection"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, there are not many truly accomplished writers in modern China's literary and artistic circles, and even fewer female writers! If we count the numbers, there have been only a few dozen since the May Fourth Movement. Moreover, many have already stopped writing. In terms of writing, each has its own merits, and all have their own glorious history in Chinese literature. These female writers have also made epoch-making contributions during the evolution of new literary and artistic trends in China. We can briefly list them in periods: Around the May Fourth Movement, female writers were very active, such as Bing Xin, Yuan Changying, Feng Yuanjun, Su Xuelin, Huang Luyin, Chen Hengzhe, Lin Huiyin, Ling Shuhua, Fang Lingru, Mu Jingqing, Lu Xiaoman, and Shen Ying, all of whom were major figures in opposing the old and establishing new literary and artistic standards at the time. Before and after the September 18th Incident, progressive female writers such as Ding Ling, Bai Wei, Wu Sihong, Jing Song, Xie Bingying, and Xiao Hong bravely fought for revolutionary literature against imperialism, achieving great fame for a time. Around the July 7th Incident, An E, Feng Zi, Wang Ying, Bai Lang, Cao Ming, Ge Qin, Luo Hong, Yang Jiang, and others enthusiastically participated in national defense literature for the War of Resistance Against Japan. Naturally, the performances of female writers in each era (I am just listing these female writers' names from memory, omissions are unavoidable, but certainly not intentional) were not limited to that era. Except for a few who died or changed careers, these female writers continued to contribute with the times.</p>
<p>China was originally a backward country in all aspects, and the Chinese women's community was even more backward! Due to the traditional view that Chinese women have always been neglected by society, female writers were also neglected without exception. However, according to the brief statistics above, although there are few modern Chinese female writers in number, they are not inferior to male writers in writing spirit, so they are worthy of our praise. Due to the neglect of female writers in the Chinese literary world and even the reasons for their existence, there has rarely been a systematic introduction and collection of works by female writers. Occasionally, some selected collections and critical books are published, but they all seem imperfect, lacking in rigor and objectivity. Recognizing this point, Chenguang Bookstore Company felt that from the May Fourth Movement to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan today, it seemed to have come to a major conclusion. It was necessary to collect the latest works of new and old female writers over these nearly thirty years in a relatively systematic way, so that readers could glimpse their progress and trends with the evolution of literary and artistic trends! Therefore, they entrusted me to compile this collection.</p>
<p>However, China's current political and economic chaos has created social instability and cultural desolation, especially in literature and art! Literary and artistic writers are under pressure from changes in material and spiritual conditions, unable to write good articles, and even less able to engage in literary and artistic revival activities. Therefore, the decline of literature and art is inevitable; it is unprecedented in the past thirty years. Therefore, during this period, it is already difficult to run a literary and artistic publication, and it is even more difficult to run a more specialized literary and artistic publication!</p>
<p>I remember when Mr. Jia Bi (the publisher of this book) first talked to me about the plan to publish "Chinese Modern Women Writers' Novel Collection," it was still in February of this year. For the sake of friendship with Jia Bi, and for the historical significance of this work, I reluctantly accepted the task despite knowing its difficulty. First of all, contacting the female writers alone took a great deal of effort, because they were scattered all over the country and abroad. After establishing a communication network, we separately solicited manuscripts, specifically asking each of them to write a novel for this collection. Fortunately, they all agreed very kindly (a few did not submit their manuscripts due to illness or busyness). However, it took several months to collect the manuscripts. Despite this, the collection was finally compiled.</p>
<p>As for the content of this collection, there is no need for me to elaborate on it, readers will have their own fair judgment. However, what I need to tell the readers is that every article in this collection is very precious. Ms. Bing Xin has not created novels for many years. This time, after returning to China from Japan, she went to Japan again, regardless of the fatigue of the journey, avoiding the sultry heat, and wrote "Untitled" in sweat. Her writing is concise, and her artistic conception is outstanding, which is truly a rare work. Ms. Feng Yuanjun has not written novels for twenty years. Now she made an exception to write "This One Fallen," which is short and exquisite, simple and skillful! Ms. Yuan Changying has also not written for a long time, but recently completed "Ox" while ill. Ms. Su Xuelin wrote "Huangshan Qi in Jinling Prison" in her busy schedule. The words of the two are more beautiful, and the skills are also very pure, worthy of being from the hands of predecessors. Ms. Chen Xiaoman stopped writing for twenty years, but recently specially wrote "Daughter's Calamity," depicting vividly and delicately. Ms. Lu Jingqing sent the exotic "Riverside Apartment" from England, Ms. Wang Ying sent the retrospective "After Parting" from New York, and Ms. Shen Ying's ethical work "Doll" are all masterpieces that readers have not easily seen in recent years; because the three of them have not held a pen for a long time. In addition, Ms. Bingying's "Divorce," Ms. Fengzi's "Linked Portraits," and Ms. Luo Hong's "Executioner" are all powerful works, each with unique features! As for my own [Boundless Sorrow of Falling Leaves], I am just at the bottom, filling the space. I dare not call myself a writer, but I hope to follow the lead of all the predecessors, learn tirelessly, and achieve a small success in the future.</p>
<p>In order to continue compiling prose, poetry, and drama collections, the female writers invited this time were not widespread. At the same time, the female writers who have already written in this collection will still be invited to participate next time. For example, Ms. Xie Bingxin, Ms. Feng Yuanjun, Ms. Su Xuelin, and Ms. Lu Jingqing can write novels and poems, so they will be indispensable in the poetry collection. Ms. Yuan Changying, Ms. Wang Ying, and others can write novels and dramas, so they will be indispensable in the drama collection. Ms. Shen Ying, Ms. Bingying, Ms. Lu Xiaoman, Ms. Fengzi, and Ms. Luo Hong can write novels and prose, so they will be indispensable in the prose collection. In short, I hope that all the female writers will jointly complete these four volumes. It's just that due to transportation relations, Ms. Ding Ling's work could not be obtained this time, which is really a great regret, but I will still try in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the editing method of this collection, according to the idea of ​​Baiguang Bookstore Company, imitating the style of European and American publishers, a photo and handwriting of the author are printed before each work. This may not be without someone who wants to slander, but in fact, it is only to strengthen the historical value and give readers a deeper impression. Moreover, a short biography of each author is attached, which is convenient for readers to study each female writer. If someone insists on misunderstanding it as a swindle, then so be it. Anyway, my conscience is clear.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you to all my friends who contributed to this collection! I wish you all forever write well, and forever open up the most brilliant literary and artistic flowers for China! (Late night on the sea, August 1, 1947) (Note: The Untitled Collection is published by Chenguang Bookstore Company and will be published in September)</p>
<h3>Old Words, New Talk</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jing'an said: "The habits of society kill many good people; the habits of literature kill many geniuses." Although this statement feels bold, after careful consideration, it has a bit of bittersweet self-awareness. Humans are a kind of animal that obeys habits, which is what Mr. Lu Xun meant by "even moving table legs and benches requires bloodshed." This application in literary creation is adherence - adherence to the past and adherence to the present, both are obeying established rules.</p>
<p>Liu Shuqing's lyrics were despised by the literati of the time because they used a lot of colloquialisms. The result of this contempt could not erase the fact that "where there is well water, there is Liu's lyrics." So even Su Xue, who held the reins of the literary world at the time, couldn't help but ask his disciples: "How are my lyrics compared to Liu Qi?"</p>
<p>However, true genius cannot be suppressed. "The willow bank, the morning breeze, and the waning moon" not only spread, but also became the mainstay of Northern Song lyricists using vernacular.</p>
<p>"Fashion" may be good, but don't make the mistake of being trendy. Although novelty sometimes seems isolated and humble, it is still a bit more adorable than a literary figure who floats with the world.</p>
<p>Su Xue's disciples said it well: "Liu's lyrics are suitable for seventeen or eighteen-year-old girls, with red ivory clappers, singing 'The willow bank, the morning breeze, and the waning moon'; Xue's lyrics are suitable for strong men from Guanxi, with copper clappers and iron boards, singing 'The great river flows eastward'!", which illustrates that Su is Su, and Liu is Liu, there is no need to unify the format, "those who are not of my race must have different hearts."</p>
<p>Therefore, genius can not only use form, transform form, but also break through the shackles of form; mediocrity is the opposite.</p>
<p>Yuan Yishan's quatrain on poetry said: "The pond spring grass is a special skill of the Xie family, ten thousand ages and a thousand autumns, the five characters are new; tell Chen Zhengzi, who closes the door, it is a pity to waste his spirit without making up for it." Jing'an said that "the Mengchuang and Yutian generations will not be happy with this sentence." Taking this as a divination, the Southern Song lyrics are indeed inferior to the Northern Song lyrics. Although the style is very different, the hand and eye also feel dusty. There are many painters of beautiful women in the world, but only Fei Xiaoqi and Qiu Shizhou are famous. It is not about skill but about divine understanding. Xiao Xie's "The clear river is as quiet as silk" is a masterpiece of all time. Although Taibai continued it with "Love Dao, the clear river is as quiet as silk, which makes people remember Xie Xuanhui for a long time," it became a dog's tail; Zhu Qingyu's "After dressing up, she asks her husband in a low voice, whether the eyebrows are deep or shallow, in time." The daughter's love is vividly on paper, but Ouyang Yongshu easily changed it to ".........When she comes and goes, she helps each other under the window and loves Dao's eyebrows, deep or shallow, are in time." Then she feels deliberately contrived. Taibai Yongshu, poetry and lyrics are shining for thousands of years, and even a step towards the trend will become Dong Shi.</p>
<p>There is also this feeling in new poems. Balmang's poem:</p>
<p>"The reason why I live</p>
<p>is to love the sun——"</p>
<p>There are as many imitators as the Jiangzhe, but none of them are as inferior as they feel. The reason is also here.</p>
<p>Baishi Mengchuang's lyrics are too ornate, so it is easy to lose its natural beauty. Its "Dark Fragrance" and "Sparse Shadow" are actually derivations of Lin Hejing's "Sparse shadows cross the shallow clear water, and dark fragrance floats in the dim moon." Writing lyrics is like painting, "sparse places can gallop horses, and dense places cannot insert needles." Hejing's poems are already so dense that needles cannot be inserted, and even if they are hung on the national gate, it is impossible to change a word. How can we talk about detailed details?</p>
<p>I love to scribble the most in my life, but I don't leave a word when I go to Qinglian's tomb in Caishiji. Why? I feel that "those who come and go write two lines, and lose the big axe in front of Lu Ban's door"; Tui praises Qing Yun Gongbu for having the "Qing Ting Stone Pillar" proposal. If I write it down, wouldn't it become "Sun Xingzhe travels here"? At most, it will only leave a bit of coquettishness in other people's palms. Why bother?</p>
<p>In Romain Rolland's "Jean-Christophe" Volume 1, Jean's grandfather was an unknown musician. In his life of depression, he suddenly got a musical genius grandson. The joy is conceivable, but he still couldn't help but secretly add a note to Jean's music, thinking that there was also his own effort in it and secretly feeling relieved. If you don't eliminate this kind of psychology when writing articles, you will never have yourself.</p>
<p>Qing Yun ascended the Yellow Crane Tower and greatly admired Cui Hao's sentence "The ancients have taken the Yellow Crane to go." All day long, "There is a scenery in front of me that I can't say, and Cui Hao wrote a poem on the top." Self-knowledge must be there. Flattery is like a scholar of rotten bean sprouts in Wu Baicai.</p>
<p>Modern people write a lot of poems about "giving to friends" and "travel notes", but they can't innovate and have their own opinions. They only know how to put together a song, which is like drawing a flower nose on their own face, making it look even uglier; "The falling moon fills the beams of the house, and I still suspect that it shines on my face." The affection is deep and the words are sincere, a masterpiece of all time; "The Qi steams Yunmengze, and the waves shake Yueyang City." The thousands of miles of Dongting Lake are all under the pen; ...... Thinking of this, it is better to put down the bald pen and read more ancient poems until you really have something to say, and then, like Huang Zhengze, "I write with my mouth, how can he restrain me...", even if it doesn't catch the eye of high-ranking elegant scholars, why not learn from Banqiao and write two Daqing songs, sing and enjoy yourself?</p>
<h3>Reed Goose</h3>

<h3>Water Dragon Chant</h3>
<p>— Xu Bangda</p>
<p>Celebrating the Fiftieth Birthday of Layman Dingshan</p>
<p>Looking at the high-rise building from a distance, an old man with a turban talks eloquently (in 1939, you set up a seat in Dingshan, with dozens of disciples, often welding late at night and talking tirelessly.); residual emotions are carried, millenniums are pressed to the beat, inner family singing and dancing; silk and satin good nights, flying cups and drunken moon; still composing now (you are good at music, the gathering of skirts and shoes in Dingshan Hall, the red ivory singing pipes, often until late at night). Leading the deep banquet, black silk red sleeves, how elegant, astonishing the parrot. Are the flags and banners of the strong years still there? The old military参前语 (Xu Shiying sent you to Japan as a secretary, and Zhang Zhizhong stationed troops in Shanghai and sent you as a staff officer, but you refused.) Vermilion gate willow courtyard, late night lights; lingering on the Jiang Road. Weary eyes are dispelled, returning clouds are stretched, how many national affairs (since returning from Dian and Shu, the Hangzhou Municipal Government hired you as the director of the local history museum, but you also refused, and became more dedicated to poetry and painting. People called you Mr. Dingshan). A date to sing in Lantian, in the bamboo forest of Cuo Garden, let's go boating together (you have another property on the lake, and you once invited me to the trap, which is seen in poetry).</p>
<h3>Water Dragon Chant</h3>
<p>— Chen Dingshan</p>
<p>Responding to Xin Yuansheng's Gift</p>
<p>Yuan Long is not a hero, thirty years of lakes and seas dissipated his heroic spirit; looking at the scenery in the high autumn, how many lines of wild geese are worth sending? The south province writes in the air, the east mountain affairs are gone, there are still guest plays; where is the mournful zither, under the cherry trees, empty with prostitutes. Betting on the flag pavilion under the sun is over, singing Yangguan's setting sun has no end; Pu Qingmu is green, how many setting sun flying rides in the middle of the view; the trap west of the lake is drawn· the turban is alone; the water grass Xiaosi, the remaining emerald ink in the world, the Songxi sends dreams, and the wine is titled　.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 369</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Here, hey!... Liang Qun and Little Tiger Lu entered the hostel, and were walking in when they suddenly heard the person calling them shouting behind them.</p>
<p>The two turned around and saw the receptionist standing in the doorway of a room inside the gate, standing upright, indicating that the two should go to the room first. This is the color of the new paint. Yaoqun didn't know, so he had to invite Little Tiger to turn back and walk back.</p>
<p>"Traveler Registration Office", a small wooden sign hung on the door, with these words painted on the sign.</p>
<p>"Where are you from?" An old fellow with glasses, sitting behind a desk, looked at Yaoqun and Little Tiger with the air of interrogating prisoners, his voice a bit Japanese-accented. On the desk was a large stack of booklets printed in the form of a list. It seemed that each page of each booklet had many items that had to be filled in. If each page of each booklet was asked like this, it would take at least several tens of minutes to fill in.</p>
<p>Even if Longqun had good patience, understood the situation, and knew that this was a way of life under the trampling of iron hooves; but after more than thirty hours of slow car journeys, and having been supporting herself under tense low pressure, she thought that she had reached a station where she could take a temporary breather, but unexpectedly, such a gloomy set came again. Even if she wanted to be more wronged and endure it, I am afraid that the overly tense mood would inevitably have a rebellious reaction.</p>
<p>The whole Little Tiger Lan can be said to be the embodiment of a violent bomb. Along the way, in this journey of more than thirty hours, there were many stimulating impacts that could trigger his explosiveness, but they were all controlled by Jiqun, reducing the amount of his explosion; he himself also had a sweet fantasy and a high pressure of a secret mission to help him control his fire. But this (eye) in front of him was indeed something that he couldn't swallow.</p>
<p>At this time, this violent bomb seemed to have suffered the greatest impact and had reached the sharp peak of explosion. Suppose that Yaoqun glared at the old fellow who asked the question at this time, or gave a sneer, or made any resistive small movement, there is no doubt that Little Tiger must have jumped forward...</p>
<p>But what would be the consequences of this leap forward? Yaoqun and Little Tiger, relying on their wit and bravery, may be able to get away with it; they can rush to the old village overnight, but you must know that at this time, Shenyang is the second largest rear defense of the Japanese army, the headquarters of the "Expeditionary Force", and all the demons and evil spirits are gathered in this country. There must be a strict and thorough security arrangement; although the surface is calm, the more calm it is, the more sinister and terrible the hidden institutions are.</p>
<p>Even if Yaoqun Little Tiger can escape, this hostel is finished. The old fellow who is in charge of registering travelers in this hostel is just a tentacle drawn from the central agency. If this tentacle is moved, the entire arrangement will naturally be affected; this hostel is the center of the accident. Let's say that these two travelers, whose names are not even known, the place where the accident occurred, according to the usual insidious and brutal personality of the Japanese devils, will inevitably be implicated. That blockade, search, false accusation, suspicion, and other unreasonable actions will inevitably be staged step by step. According to a casual estimate, there are at least dozens of people in the hostel's duties, including the innocent travelers, who will suffer innocent disasters. It really corresponds to the saying that "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the pond are affected."</p>

<h3>Scientists Should Speak Up!</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<p>This time, President Truman sent special envoy General Wedemeyer to China to conduct inspections. As soon as he got off the car, he made a statement saying that the task of this trip was to interview facts, collect materials, and solicit opinions, so that he could bring them to Washington as a reference for the United States to redefine its policy towards China, or even the Far East. In the past ten days, General Wei and his party have visited Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Shen, Bi, Han, Chongqing, Guangdong, Taiwan and other places, and have had frequent contact with all walks of life in our country. It is said that they have obtained many valuable reports and materials. Our country's industrial, commercial, and financial circles, and government departments, have successively provided various reports on politics, diplomacy, military affairs, transportation, and economy. Various parties have also published some opinions on improving politics. Wei has consulted extensively, is tireless in seeking details, and listens with an open mind. He does not express his own opinions, and strives to make the public's opinions and true public opinion put forward without reservation and played without scruples. This is a very enlightened approach and a very democratic expression.</p>
<p>At a time when all parties are offering opinions, what we regret is that until now, we have not heard the voice of the scientific community, and we have not seen any scientists from Yanqiao express some opinions on science. Are we not hoping for American aid? Is it difficult to say that our fragmented, poor, and weak scientific undertakings are not in need of practical help? Furthermore, in terms of improving the national economy and people's livelihood and promoting the great cause of nation-building, which field can do without science? Now that the United States has a plan to assist China's revival, science must occupy an important part. Moreover, the United States is a country with a very developed science, and everyone knows the importance of science. The opinions of our scientific community will definitely be valued by the Americans. We should seek truth from facts, consider the national conditions, and take advantage of this good opportunity to provide some opinions and plans for China's construction of science, so as to be a reference for General Wei. Time waits for no one, and it will be gone in a flash. I think that all scientific institutions, scientific groups, and individual scientists across the country should speak up!</p>
<h3>The Scientific Method of Detecting Lies</h3>
<p>— Liang Mu</p>
<p>In recent years, scientists have invented several machines to detect lies, and the results of the experiments are quite astonishing. Various newspapers and magazines have published articles about these machines, and many foreign machinery companies sell them, so let's not dwell on that. Now, let's talk about some interesting stories related to this issue.</p>
<p>Ancient savages knew how to deceive people with lies. However, at that time, there were no good methods to test whether a person's words were lies. Except for those who were not accustomed to lying, when their words were discovered to be inconsistent, they would blush, stammer, be at a loss, and speak incoherently. In such cases, people could immediately see that they were lying. However, those who were accustomed to lying and good at deceiving not only remained composed but could also justify themselves, making people believe them even more, unaware of being deceived. When ordinary people lie, even if they can remain composed, many internal changes occur in their bodies, such as an increased blood circulation, leading to blushing, rapid breathing, and a dry mouth, among other phenomena. Therefore, in ancient China, there was a special method for judging criminals: during questioning, the criminal was made to chew a mouthful of rice, and then asked to spit it out to see if it was drier than usual. If it was drier than usual, it proved that the person was lying and must have committed a crime. There were also some superstitious people who, when they told a lie and did not admit it, if asked to swear to heaven, to a lamp, or to the idols in a temple, would panic, turn pale, and show that they dared not swear, proving that they were lying and deceiving.</p>
<p>In ancient times, people also used psychological methods to detect lies. There is a very interesting story about psychological methods. This story is about an Indian prince who used a very clever method to find the real criminal from among many suspects. His method was to confine these suspects in a room, make them stand facing the wall with their hands behind their backs, and then tell them that there was a sacred donkey in the next room. If the person who committed the crime pulled its tail, it would bray loudly. Each person, in turn, went to pull the donkey's tail and then returned to their original position, standing with their hands behind their backs. As a result, everyone pulled the donkey's tail, but the donkey did not bray. Then the prince came over and asked everyone to stretch out their hands. He immediately knew who the real criminal was. It turned out that when he asked them to pull the donkey's tail, the Indian prince had smeared some black color on the donkey's tail. Everyone who was innocent had their hands covered in black, except for the real criminal, who had no black on his hands at all. This was because of his psychological reaction. He knew he had committed the crime and was afraid that if he pulled the donkey's tail, the donkey would bray and the prince would know he was the criminal, so he dared not pull it. The Indian prince used this psychology and their superstition to identify the criminal.</p>
<p>In ancient times, people had simple minds and were superstitious about ghosts and gods, so psychological or superstitious methods could be used to detect them. Nowadays, people are neither superstitious nor unintelligent, so this method is no longer effective. Therefore, scientists have recently been researching how to use scientific methods to detect lies and have invented several machines. The results of the experiments are very promising. If these machines are foolproof and can be widely adopted, it may be a great contribution to the judicial system in judging criminals. In Europe, people have been researching machines to detect lies for two or three hundred years, but only in recent decades have there been scientific machines and reliable experiments.</p>
<p>In 1922, William Moulton Marston of the Psychology Laboratory at Harvard University in the United States began his research. He conducted many experiments, and as a result, he found that whenever someone lied, their body underwent changes, the most obvious of which was an increase in blood pressure. In 1914, Vittorio Benussi in Graz, Austria, invented a method for detecting lies. The principle he based it on was that when a person lies, their breathing inevitably speeds up, and this acceleration can be measured very accurately. Three years later, Harold Burtt improved Benussi's method in the laboratory at Harvard University. In 1921, Dr. John Larson, in collaboration with the famous criminologist August Vollmer in California, USA, invented a machine for detecting lies called the Erlanger Sphygmomanometer and experimented on many criminals and suspects. The results of the experiments were also very accurate. In 1925, L. Keeler of Stanford University invented a machine called the Polygraph. Keeler became a professor of criminology at Northwestern University in the United States in 1930 and was a world-renowned criminologist. This machine also measures changes in blood pressure and breathing when a person lies. This type of machine is now widely used. Among similar machines, if used properly, this machine is the most reliable. (1)</p>

<h3>Powerful Liquid Explosive</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>Although we are in the atomic age and have atomic bombs, do we still need other explosives? It is questionable how many countries can actually manufacture atomic bombs. Therefore, the liquid explosive I am talking about here is also a novel piece of knowledge.</p>
<p>Lester P. Barlow and his colleague R. G. Holderer have invented a liquid carbon explosive. This explosive is a new type of liquid carbon gas explosive called "Glimite," and its destructive power is truly astonishing. It can cause all people and animals within a circular area with a radius of one thousand feet, centered on the point of explosion, to perish together.</p>
<p>We invited several journalists to observe the results of bombing with this explosive. To prove that this bomb is not affected by fire and vibration, they burned the bombs, shot bullets into the bombs, and fired them from a mortar to a height of five hundred feet, causing them to impact a steel plate and bounce three hundred feet. None of these actions resulted in an explosion. According to Barlow, this explosive is made by absorbing carbon and other secret substances into liquid gas, and its explosive force will not degrade until it is saturated and left for thirty hours. Liquid gas explosives have been used for a long time, but this liquid gas carbon explosive has a greater destructive power due to its extremely high pressure. Another advantage of this explosive is its low production cost. It is said that it costs only four and a half US dollars per pound.</p>
<h3>The Total Mobilization of Soviet Geographers During the War</h3>
<p>— Yan Deyi</p>
<p>The completion of the new map of Kazakhstan is a crystallization of this great work. Various maps with scales of 1:1,000,000 to 1:5,000,000 have been surveyed and drawn. Data on resource surveys have been compiled into a new geographical circle of Kazakhstan, which will soon be printed. This kind of practical investigation of original data is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>The Soviet Geographical Research Institute's research on this new region focuses on three key points: industrial development, transportation construction, and urban design. Almaty, originally a village in the Central Asian grasslands, has now been built into the capital of the Kazakh Republic. Its location is a joint transportation station for international traffic between the Soviet Union and Xinjiang, making it a new international contact city in Central Asia.</p>
<p>Before 1941, the geography of Kazakhstan was one of the least documented areas on Earth. Now, it is becoming the most meticulously studied geographical unit in regional geographical research in the world. Not only is its geographical research an innovation in academia, but in terms of scientific application, the creation of "regional design" work is the highest achievement in geographical research methods. When the Kazakh Republic held its 25th anniversary celebration in November 1943, the Soviet Geographical Research Institute specially exhibited a portion of its academic achievements. The scale of operation of the Kazakh Republic and the establishment of its capital, Almaty, immediately demonstrated the achievements of practical undertakings. Geographical research work is a pioneer in modern regional design, which is thought-provoking.</p>
<p>In addition to Kazakhstan, geographical research in Central Asia is also being carried out in its adjacent areas, such as northern Kyrgyzstan in the south, and Omsk, Chelyabinsk, and Kurgan in the north. At the same time, it has also made contributions to the Altai Mountains and the Fergana Valley. The geography within the territory of the Turkmen Republic is the responsibility of the Department of Economic Geography of Moscow University. For the past three years, it has been working in cooperation with the Geographical Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the results are also considerable.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of World War II, the Soviet Geographical Research Institute was already engaged in the study of inland depression areas. It had attempted to utilize the water power of the Caspian Sea to irrigate the adjacent Kara-Bogaz-Gol depression and develop its iron ore and sulfide resources. After 1943, as the war situation improved, the central work of the Soviet Geographical Research Institute shifted to focusing on the reconstruction work of the Donets Basin and the central industrial area near Moscow.</p>
<p>The diligent contributions of Soviet geographers greatly benefited strategic and tactical aspects during the war, and were highly valued by the military authorities. A military geographical research association was formally established, and geographers were often invited to discuss specialized military issues and express their opinions. Military experts were sent to participate in geographical expeditions to new areas, and geography lectures were established in military schools at all levels across the country to popularize military geographical education. The emphasis on wartime geographical research achievements can be imagined.</p>
<p>The above is not an exhaustive account of all the wartime work of Soviet geographers, as they also devoted much effort to participating in geographical research in the polar regions. After the victory, shifting from wartime work to peacetime work, the Soviet geographical field will continue to study problems in physical geography and historical geography from a purely scientific standpoint. This is the recent view of Grigoriev, the director of the Geographical Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. (End)</p>
