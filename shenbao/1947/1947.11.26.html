<h3>杜威促緊急援華　呼籲美探兩洋防共政策</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐約廿四日電〕紐約州長杜威廿四日向政府呼籲探取一兩洋防共外交政策，據稱：僅一億渺小緊急援助之數，即能救一自由之中國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿四日電〕共和黨紐約州長杜威，今夜在壽倫比亞大學法學院畢業生同學會議會席上致辭稱：以對華政策變輪，美國政府已告破產，茍不援助中國，則其四億五千完自由人民可能落入共產黨之手。美國及其他反對獨裁各國，目下正受各種方法之攻擊，僅未開戰而已。共產黨征服世界控制尚除之自由民族，在其中最大之中國進展尤速。原來之「冷戰」，在歐洲己變成「熟戰」，在中國卻更熟正得手。在此危急之世界，吾人必須有所作爲，如謂吾人於戰勝之侯，顧將勝利之果拱手讓人，聽任各國自由民族陷於經濟經亂，接受蘇聯控制，殊屬不可思義。惟西歐二億七千五百萬人如屬重要，則中國四億五千萬人由余視之，亦極重要。總統於上星期一向國會提川之鑒急援助方案，發無變字提及中國，余聞之大爲失望，此在失去自由中國間不容髮之危機中，完全不重想像。</p>
<p>杜氏主張以美金七千五百萬元至一億之作爲對華緊急援助，列入現在國會討論之對歐臨時救濟法案。對華援助原已憂議於三四年中，每年助以二億五千萬元，維持中國之經濟生命，俾得從事與共。太平洋方面陸軍剩除物資，亦應運華接濟。杜氏亦承認中國現政府容有不能令人滿意之處，惟謂該政府亦站在人類自由方面與吾人共同奮鬥，對付殘酷之獨裁主義。杜氏最後稱：中國如陷落，亞洲全部即不保，屆時西歐及南北美洲勢必在舉世皆敵之環境中域立無援。</p>

<h3>亞洲人民的呼喚！</h3>
<p>——評菲總統及我國代表之演說——</p>
<p>聯合國亞洲暨遠柬經濟委員會，已於廿四日在非律濱碧瑤舉行第二屆大會，中·英·美·蘇·法·荷·菲·暹·印·澳十國代表，均已聯袂抵菲；聯合國社會經濟委員會副秘書長沃文，亦特地自美赴菲，主持開幕儀式，菲總統羅哈斯以地主的資格，首向各國代表政歡迎辭，籲請各國切勿忽略亞洲與遠束，並嚴正表示亞洲人民應獲得國際援助，以建立健全之工業，從而促進全人類之幸福與繁榮。旋卽由大會主席卽我國代表蔣廷黻致詞，力言亞洲經濟問題之重要，認此爲一切問題之根本；根除貧困之基本原因，尤爲亞洲各國之當前務急。同時又指出在亞洲一區域內，任何一國不能因其他國家之貧困而獲利，但任何一國之繁榮，則足使其他各國咸受其益。羅蔣二氏的演說，實可視爲亞洲人民的共同呼聲。値得富有國家的重視，尤其是對於援歐援亞舉棋不定的美國應該特別注意這亞洲人民從心的深處發出來的呼喚！</p>
<p>遠東經濟委員會設立的要旨，雖然偏重於經濟方面，不是一種帶有政治作用的國際會議，其任務僅在：　增加亞洲暨遠東區域內各國的生產能力：　提高亞洲暨遠東區域內各國人民的生活程度：　謀取亞洲暨遠東區域內各國的經濟合作以及此區域與世界其他區域的經濟合作。但其最終的作用，決不限於經濟的一方面，而在政治上亦有共非常重要的影響。因爲在今日的世界上，政治與經濟已經分不開，政治的安定，往往有賴於經濟間題的解決；反之，經濟的穩定，也有賴於政治的開明與進步：所以我們對於遠東經濟委員會所負的任務，始終認爲是非常重大的。回顧遠東經濟委員會在滬召開第一屆大會時，我國朝野就予以莫大的注視，惟第一屆大會的性質，係屬一種預備會議，僅在研究亞洲曁遠東各國於戰時所受的經濟損失，以提供建議如何恢復各該國的經濟情形，從而建立各國間正常的經濟關係，如此而已；至於如何始能使各國從經濟復興中求得安定？怎樣促進遠東各國間的經濟合作謀得遠東的繁榮？又如何加强遠東區域與世界其他區域的經濟聯繫？這些都是此次遠東經濟會議的主要課題。所以我們對於這次會議的期待特別大。</p>
<p>今日之亞洲暨遠東各國，在大戰之後莫不瘡痍滿目，元氣大傷，到處充滿了可悲的慘象，亞洲人民的愁眉苦臉，不用描摹，就可以想像得知的。十國的代表現正在菲島碧瑤，無異置身於亞洲的愁城之中，不論是眼睛所看到的，或是耳朵所聽到的，無一不是亞洲人民困苦顚沛的情形。現在遠凍經濟委員會，旣以促進各國經濟合作從而謀取各國的繁榮爲自任，自然最重要的事情乃在十國代表能够正視亞洲的現實，對症下藥，提供切實有效的建議，俾使亞洲暨遠東各國均能早日脫離苦海，而步入復興繁榮的境界。我們並非不重視理論與計劃，但是我們終覺得任何高談闊論而不切實際的建議，都是無補於亞洲暨遠東各國的實際的。所以我們不得不大膽率直指出，在今日滿目蕭條的亞洲曁遠東區域，欲言經濟復興與繁榮而得不到富强國家的全力援助，則任何完善的計劃，都無異於紙上談兵，決不會產生良好的結果。這是一種客觀的事實，非主觀的見解所能左右，我們並不是存心耍亞洲暨遠東各國依賴富有國家的經濟援助，但是殘酷的戰爭毁滅了亞洲曁遠東各國的物質條件，使他們不得不需要外來的援助。</p>
<p>我們相信美國負責當局，對於戰後的世界各國，不論是歐洲的國家或者是亞洲的國家，早就有同樣的認識。杜魯門總統於今年四五月間，看到歐洲各國經濟危急的情形，爲使其不致陷於崩潰起見，特向國會提出一種經濟援助歐洲各國的計劃：後來文因為國會的遲遲不決，而歐洲各國的經濟情形，每况愈下，使杜魯門總統不得不召開國會特別會諸，俾使馬歇爾國務卿的緊急援歐計劃，得以早日通過，得以早日實施，得以早日减輕歐洲人民的痛苦，美國這種慷慨爲懷的精神，固然値得我的欽佩與讚揚，但是美國當局對於亞洲的經濟情形，明知也非常危念，其程度甚至超過歐洲，亞洲人民在饑餓綫上掙扎呻吟的，較之歐洲人民，不知要多出百倍千倍，但是美國當局仍舊熟視無睹，依然無動於中，迄今尙未議及經濟援助亞洲的計劃。美國朝野或者可以「歐洲第一」的理論來解說，但是我們要奉吿美國的朝野，美國國內繁榮的基礎，旣完全建立在海外市塲上，就得明白，美國經濟決無「天下皆貧唯我獨富」的道理。亞洲各國長此在困苦中掙扎，美國若不及時予以經濟的援助，則亞洲各國的生產力旣無法增加，人民的生活水準也就不能提高，奢談國際經濟合作，無異於癡人說夢話，遠東經濟委員會卽使不時開會，通過許多好聽的計劃，也是徒勞無益的，決不會解決遠東的經濟問題的</p>
<p>要之，今日貧苦的亞洲各國所迫切需要的，不是空空洞洞的計劃，更不是外交家的美麗動聽的高談闊論，而是物質的援助與技術的合作，先使她們休養生息，恢復元氣，然後始能再進一步，謀取產業的工業現代化，共謀世界經濟的安定與繁榮，這個任務固然要聯合國機構盡其極大的努力，俾能完成；但是我們終希望美國的政治外交家放大眼光，不忽視亞洲各國的重要性，而能將援歐計劃擴大至亞洲？共謀歐亞的復興，這幾天來，美國共和黨令袖，到處向人民演說，莫不以援亞援華爲言，足見亞洲人民的呼喚，不僅已獲得美國人民的同情，而且已引起美國若干政治家的共鳴了。但願美國當局特別重視亞洲人民的呼喚！蔣主席廿三日檢閱赴京露營之滬中正中學童軍（勵志社攝）</p>

<h3>外長會議和尙未決定　貝文主持揭幕禮　開會前夕充滿洽空氣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：四國外長會議第六屆會鐵，今日下午三時半（格林威治時間，上海時間下午十一時半）在此間蘭凱斯特大厦揭幕，由英外相貝文下特揭幕禮。此次會議之首要任務，乃在討論對總奧和約問題，英美兩國似欲採取較温和之態度，以謀減輕東西間之激烈爭執。會議須首先解決者，厥爲議程問題，蓋四强外長代表　欲就此一問題獲致協議而未獲成功者也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕「歐洲命還」所繫之外長會議，於今日開幕，美國務卿馬歇爾到達會塲時，羣衆歡聲雷動，馬氏偕隨員蒞會最早，精神甚爲愉快。渠向記者稱，「目前渠極有信心」。莫洛托夫亦受翠衆歡呼，貝文與皮杜爾幾同時到達，并肩步入會塲。記者未能在會塲旁聽，第一次會議詳情尙待發表。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：四國外長先後蒞塲後，德境英美蘇佔區之軍事長官，即羅勃森將軍，克萊將軍與索柯洛夫斯基元帥亦逐一到塲。克萊御便服，克氏之政治顧問墨飛偕來。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕英官方今日宣稱，只文外相昨夜與蘇外長莫洛托夫晤談甚歡，雙方均承認四國外長會歲之一致，匪特對於德奧，即對於世界前途，關係亦極重大。貝文將照旣定方針拉攏美蘇，其態度自將較美國務卿馬歇爾爲和緩，貝文昨夜亦　訪馬氏晤談。會塲四周已加警戒備，所有閑雜人等概受嚴密監視或受盤問。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕貝文外相於廿四日夜晤馬歇爾及莫洛托夫，企圖解決關於外長會議程之困難。皮杜爾外長昨抵倫敦後，立即加入會談，會議之範　程序及時期，迄猶未能爲外人所知，由於外長代表之未能議定外長會之議程，故外長會議將在沒有談程的狀態下舉行。議程雖未定，然外長會之任務，當爲　決定德國是否將繼續在四强管制下治理，或任其在政治上或經濟上裂成兩國；　外長會如果失敗，防止歐洲分裂之加深，並調整諸强間之關係，　決定於對奧和約訂立後是否給予奧國獨立與主權。德國問題之　結在於蘇聯之要求提取德國西部之生產作爲賠償，及蘇聯之要求共管魯爾。奧國問題之癥結，則在奧境德國資產問題。觀察家相信諸强就奧境德資產事互相讓步，並非不可能，故料倫敦會議至少能簽訂　奧和約。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕就開會前數小時內情緒觀之，美國務卿馬歇爾與英外相貝文仍極反對蘇聯關於德國之政治經濟及賠償等要求。法外長皮杜爾以國內　　不安，處境困難，美代表團方面猜疑法國共黨故意與之爲難。法代表國方面則謂，皮氏擬使法國政策與英美一致，靜待蘇外長莫洛托夫採取何種主動，以謀本屆會議獲致若干切實結果。會議陣容因之成爲三對一之局面，與莫斯科會議如出一轍。</p>
<h3>美蘇關係前途　各方表關切</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿五日廣播：聯合國大會即將結東，各國代表在整理行裝之際，對美蘇關係前途，均表示悲觀。樂觀者之離求，無　在賭局中之不易發現傳敎士。少數樂觀者，均集中其注意力於倫敎外長會，彼等以爲馬歇爾國務卿將不顧胡佛與貝爾納斯之勸吿，而努力與蘇聯覓致協議。美國人民對於美蘇前途，表示極大之關切，美醫藥協會主席包滋憂心如焚，建議每一美國城市，應立即準備原子彈戰爭，採取步驟，保證受原子傷者可獲醫藥上之治撩。世界猶太公會主席威斯　請杜魯門總統，史達林與艾德禮立即舉行三強會議，並明白宣佈第三次大戰決不致發生。</p>
<h3>德記者在倫敦採訪會塲新聞</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕世界各國新聞記者，攝影員及無綫電廣播員，在四外長會議採訪消息者約共一百人，其中且有德國記者，此爲戰後第一次。</p>
<h3>對德問題安全第一　法國立場仍不變　魯爾國際化與德國脫離</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿四日電〕法國在倫敦會議中，或將要求在德國聯邦分櫂制度下，實行政治統一，提出四大條件：　德國務須受嚴厲監視，使其永不復爲法國之威脅。　法國務須確保其自魯爾區域獲得充分煤斤之供給，以使先於德國完成復興。今春莫斯科會議時，法國與英美成立之伸縮協定，已遠不能滿足法國之要求。　重要煤礦所在之薩爾流域，務須併入法國經濟範圍內。法國已在沿薩爾及德國邊界設立關卡，並以法郞代替舊薩爾馬克。　德工業中心之　爾流域及萊因河西岸，務須與德國本部脫離，魯爾區域務須國際化。萊因區應由盟國軍隊佔據指導其自成一國。</p>
<p>皮杜爾及其顧問曾集中於魯爾問題，認爲此乃德國之兵工廠，法國欲獲充分安全，必須以此作爲看守點。法國主張長期監視德國，並贊成美國所提之四十年解除德武裝計劃。法國準備反對蘇聯突然提出全面及立即撤退佔領軍之要求，認爲軍隊之留駐，若非爲取得德國人和平允諾之唯一方法，至少亦爲最妥當之方法。</p>
<h3>奧外長談話</h3>
<p>外國在奧境財產應受奧法律管轄</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕奧外長葛魯勃在倫敦向記者發表談話稱，奧政府決不同意不具和平解決可能性或使奧國無從對本國經濟行使主權之條約。莫斯科外長會議所設之四强對奧條約委員會在維也納開會後，對於各要點業已瞭如指掌，蘇聯所提之建議中有四點，與奧國政府之基本態度相左，即　蘇聯接收奧境德資金，並不同時接收附屬於德資金之債務及其他義務；　蘇聯所接收之德資產，以後不得由奧收歸國營；　奧政府不得阻止德產學息之移轉於蘇聯；　履行關於德產之協定發生爭執時，由奧政府與該關係國直接談判。葛氏聲明奧政府之基本態度，乃爲外國在奧一切財產，應受奧國法律管轄。</p>
<p>〔聯合社維也納廿四日電〕奧總統倫納今日發表宣言，促請締結對奧和約，並撤退國境十萬佔領軍。據稱，奧地利旣不希望亦不願意成爲國際關係之焦點。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統向國會報告　救濟法案基金分配情形　我國得二千七百七十萬美元</h3>
<p>〔國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門總統本日向國會報吿：自本年七月卅日國會撥付美國對外救濟計劃之款項三億三千二百萬美元以來，截至十月底爲止，預算案中餘款僅二千四百七十六萬六千八百八十六美元。截至十月份爲止，業經批准之支出，包括成本，保險費，與水脚，開列如下：奧國：八八·六三九·一四六美元；中國：二七·七〇〇·〇〇〇美元；希臘：三八·七三一·七四七美元；義大利：一二一·二九六·六七八美元；特里雅斯特：九·七六五·九四三美元；國際兒意緊急基金：一千五百萬美元；志願救濟會運輸基金：五百萬美元；行政經費（國務院）：六十萬美元；公民糧食委員會：五十萬美元。</p>
<h3>法新閣不斷召開會議　商遏阻工潮對策　全國交通已陷麻痹狀態</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿五日電〕許曼新閣定於廿六日晨舉行內閣全體會議，決定經濟與政治之政策，制止蔓延全國牽涉百萬工人之工潮。政府於商定方案後，將立即接見全國總工會代表團，該會曾要求許曼總理與以「最早接見之機會」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿五日電〕共黨領導下一百二十餘萬工人之罷工，幾使法國工業全部停頓。而新發生之交通工人罷工，頗有使法國與外界隔絕之處。在總工會命令究全罷工時，已有局部之電話工人等在罷工中。鐵路工人之罷工迫使火車停駛，船舶之行駛亦以至最低限度，蓋各港口均遭共黨封閉。煤礦以及最重要之各項工業均已停頓。巴黎等各地冬雨緊驟，更加深法國不安與悲慘之情緒。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿四日電〕法國罷工工人今日已達一百萬名，許曼總理已決定採取强有力之辦法防止工潮擴大，同時對於工人要求亦準備作可能之讓步，至於以何法應付工潮，則政府方面尙未宣布。或問政府是否將接收鐵路及其他罷工工業，據答稱，或有可能。政府方面並謂許曼總理或可接受龍工工人要求，將工資最低數自每月七千法郞增至一萬零八百法郞，惟須以立即復工爲條件。但共產黨操縱之總工會要求立即增加工資百分之廿五，以待談判調整工資，則絕難允准。</p>
<h3>英兵上書蘇外長請釋回留蘇妻兒</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫教廿四日電〕戰時娶俄女爲妻之英兵十二人今日在民間發起「上書莫洛托夫」運動，欲使蘇聯放彼等之妻兒來英。各該兵士昨日曾携小册一本，前往大使館，留下小册而去，因莫洛托夫約期會晤，以便說明英兵之妻子何以不發給出境護照。同時，英外次梅休在下院中答復問話稱，蘇聯企圖德境英佔領區蘇聯公民與孤兒不遺散爲口實，扣留英兵妻子，實屬不常。本屆聯大會通過准許棄門及巴基斯坦參加聯全國，圖為棄門代表團，左起第四人為首席代表阿白杜拉親王。</p>

<p>康納爾遜將升任總長</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：華盛頓訊，白宮今日宜布，郵政總長漢尼根提出辭呈，業已照准，總統將任命第一副總長康納爾遜繼任總長。</p>
<h3>史泰孫競選　發表政治主張</h3>
<p>維持自由經濟避免戰爭</p>
<p>〔合衆社密華基廿四日電〕史泰遜廿四日正式公開進行其一九四八年共和黨總統競選運動，並攻擊共和黨中其他有被推選爲總統候選人之人物，渠攻擊紐約州長杜威之沉默，並宣有渠本人担任總統時，願實現兩項最高目標：　對人對已獲得逐漸改善之生活，避免畸形繁榮與經濟凋敝，竭力維持自由經濟；　爲美人及全人類獲得更大之個人自由，避免第三次大戰之悲劇。史氏稱：渠如出任總統，渠將經常對各國聲明，各國不必恐懼美國侵略，但各國如犯侵略行動，則渠等殊有恐懼美國對抗行動之理由，吾人決不對任何國家施行綏靖政策。</p>
<h3>赫爾利　竸選參議員</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新墨西哥州聖太菲廿四日電〕美國前駐華大使赫爾利今日宣稱，渠在相當時間內，將宣佈其爲共和黨提名之新墨西哥州參議員候選人，以興民主黨之哈區對抗。赫氏在上次大選時，曾由共和黨提名候選，但爲民主黨參議員謙夫所敗。</p>
<h3>美國發糧援助遠東勃列廳斯認為太少</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿四日合衆電〕美參院撥款委員會主席勒列奇斯稱：該委員會尙不知國務院於撥糧緩和中國，印度，及亞洲其他國家　饉問題所作之建議如何。吾人迄今所運往各該國之糧食，倘與運往歐洲者相較，其數實甚微。</p>
<h3>解散日財閥新方案　美國突請展期討論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕今日據官方消息，美國已請十一國遠東委員會展期討論第二步解散日本財閥方案。此頭方案原係數星期前美國所提出，其內容迄未實布，嗣悉，美國擬加以修正，俾減輕其分量。遠東委員會今日開會時，美代表即聲明國務院對於此案措辭及若干技術方面擬略加修正，應請暫緩討論。數星期以來，美國對日經濟政策。屢受美國一部份商界批評，認爲解散日本財閥之舉足以促成日本實行社會主義，且使日本商業情形對於其本國及與日木經商之外國均蒙不利。</p>
<h3>日閣遭重大打擊　工礦委會推翻煤礦法案　政府三與黨責自由黨無理取鬧</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿五日電〕片山哲內閣廿五日下午已遭初次打擊，因其煤礦國家管制法案在向議會提出討論前，即爲工礦委會所推翻也。該委會今日下午集會時，到委員廿九人，僅九人投贊成票。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿五日電〕日社會，民主，及國協三然，因自由黨多方搗亂下，議會陷入混亂狀態，亟謀予以有力之反擊，乃於昨晚發表緊急發明，將此次政潮之責任完全推於自由黨。</p>
<p>聲明略謂：近兩三日來，自由黨在國會巾，遇事均無理取鬧，有意妨礙議會之進行，完全不顧民主主義國會應有之精神。政府三與黨曾作最大之讓步，並已盡最大之努力，煤礦國營案亦已於廿四日之會議上提川最後之妥協案，但仍被自由黨拒絕，國會議事，因而陷於停頓狀態。似此情形，三與黨實已無可奈何，特將是非公諸國人云。</p>
<p>衆院議長避不見面</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿五日電〕衆院全會廿四日晚七時五十五分於宛如暴風雨之怒號中開會，坐於議長席上者爲民主黨出身之田中萬逸副議長，而未見成爲問題人物之松岡駒吉議長之踪跡。自由黨有先準備提出不信任議長案，而民主黨則爭欲先提出信任議長案，政府黨及在野黨之間，發生劇烈爭執，至八時五十分尙未能發見妥協之餘地，會議始終未入正軌，而呈國會開會以來空前之混亂狀態。</p>
<h3>松井罪行證據確鑿</h3>

<p>〔巾央社東京廿五日專電〕據國際軍事法庭今傍午所提出之證件，被控應負「南京大屠殺」案罪犯之松井石根，於一九四一年會著當有煽動性之論文數篇，力主在美國未準備就緒之前、對美開戰。據稱，此前任日本華中派這軍軍令之戰犯松井，曾出力阻止一九四一年美日談判之成功。法庭提出論文數篇，　示松井曾指明美英暨若干「民主國家」爲日本當前之敵國。松井於論文中並稱，「余絕對反對與美國作任何妥協」。又稱：「企圖解決對華戰爭」為荒誕之錯誤。松井於其一九四一年七月間之論文中稱：如美國於短期內對德宣戰，則日本應履行其對三戰同盟條約之義務，毅然起而宣戰。総井論文又稱：美國「旣無準備，亦無力　，從事兩面作戰。」美國之眞正意圖，乃在「欺騙日本」延長談判，俾可獲得準備作戰之時間</p>
<h3>美蘇貿易大致平衡</h3>
<p>蘇物資輸美者較多</p>
<p>〔美國新開處華盛頓廿四日電〕根據商務部之數字今年第三季問之美蘇貿易，大致已達平衡。美國輸出至蘇聯者價値二千三百萬元，美國自蘇聯輸人者則爲二千七百萬元。輸入物品中大部爲皮貨，鉻及鎂礦，烟草，及棉花除毛器，至於輸出方面則主要爲各種機器及金屬製成品。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿四日電〕在表決聖地前途第一次試驗投票中，聯合國今日否決阿拉伯所提由國際法庭決定聯合國是否有合法權力決定巴勒斯坦將來之要求。自此次投票後，將再有一連串之投票，以表決無數之動議及補充提案，藉使巴勒斯坦委會能將最後決定提交大會。阿拉伯提案第一部份以廿五票對十八票否決，十一國棄權。阿提案尙有一部份，係要求國際法庭除決定聯合國是否有權力決定外，更應判定聯合國有否能力推行分治案，此一部份以二十票對廿一票被否決，十三國棄權。委員會又以十七票對十四票，廿五國棄欄，通過阿拉伯建議，要求各國召歸所屬之猶太難民及遣散人衆，並協助彼等安居樂業。其後委員會以十八對十八票，廿二票棄權，否決阿拉伯所提設立特委會決定會負國吸收猶太難民等人數之建議。委員會再以廿九對十二票，十四國棄權，擊敗阿拉伯提議立即產生「單一獨立」巴勒斯坦國家之建議。</p>

<h3>雁過衡陽　抗戰紀念城　南北分水嶺</h3>
<p>（本報衡陽廿日航訊）我國古詩中有「雁過衡陽」之句，凡到過衡陽的人，都能實感到這時句的眞切味。原來衡陽是湘南的一個古城，自古以衡陽作爲中國南北的分水嶺，雁是寒帶的飛禽，常秋天來時，北方的鴻雁到南方來尋食，飛到衡陽就中止了。所以衡陽南門的一座土邱，名之爲「雁廻峯」。雖然此說是不可靠的，因爲北雁南飛，並不見得就祗到衡陽爲止。然而，以氣候來說，這裘確近似南中國的氣候，衡陽沒有秋，三個晴天穿單衣，三個雨天穿棉衣。住慣東南沿海省份的人，對於衡陽的氣候是感到有點反常的。</p>
<p>在戰時暴發起來</p>
<p>衡陽在戰前並不爲人所注意，粵漢路通車後，衡陽才漸漸繁榮起來，戰時這裏因爲是公路的交叉點，湘桂路通軍後，這裏又是終點，所以商務特別發達，一時有「戰時漢口」之目，變成了冒險家的樂風。小小的衡陽，有着八十萬以上的人口，市塲擴張到舊衡陽城區十里外的地區，不僅是湖南唯一的城市，也是戰時後方唯一的商塲，衡陽在戰時的地位，在國人心目中，並不亞於桂林·昆明·重慶。</p>
<p>又在戰時毁滅下去</p>
<p>衡陽在戰時成了暴發戶，可是也在戰時毁滅了。三十二年的湘桂戰中，衡陽演出了四十八天保衛戰的一幕，遭了強烈的砲火洗禮，她的損失較之戰時任何一個城市的犧牲都軍大，澈頭澈尾地被毀滅得一乾二凈，直接作戰的士兵，整個第十軍剩餘無幾，民伕葬身於槍林彈雨中的，達三千餘名，被敵人慘殺和間接因戰禍　病以致死亡者，數逾三十餘禺人，燒燬房屋四萬五千餘棟、摧毁大小工廠一百八十餘家，荒廢田土三十七萬餘畝，損失財產八千餘億元。勝利復員後，踏進衡陽市，幾疑置身廢墟。現在距光復已兩年餘了，衡陽還是顯着破碎支離，到處斷垣頽　，荒烟漫草。</p>
<p>一萬多頭顱的公墓</p>
<p>衡陽因爲有四十八天的保構戰，爲我抗戰史上寫下最光榮的一頁，所以命名爲抗戰紀念城。這座紀念城中，唯一的紀念品是湘桂路車站旁的第十軍陣亡將士公墓。這座公墓建築在張家山上，是當年守衡戰中一個整國，上自團長，下迄雜兵，僅餘一位團附受傷抬回城中未死，全部壯烈犧牲在那裏的所在。當敵人佔領衝陽後，這一整團的忠骸就地草草掩埋在戰壕裏。光復後的今年春季，十軍預十師師長葛先才將軍派員來衡檢收四郊忠骨，即就張家山建藥公墓。</p>
<p>公墓限於經費，修築簡陋，所殮埋的全部都是零碎的屍骨，並無一具完整的骨骸，以頭顱計，共一萬兩千餘其，現在墓穴雖合，但在周圍隔有氣洞，經氣洞向裏窺視，白骨櫐桑，淸晰可見。此一萬二千餘個頭骨的公墓，政府與地方都沒有重視它，當你前往憑弔的時候，荒山上的寂寥，凹眼塌鼻的頭顱，會引起你一聲長吁，甚至淌下辛酸的眼淚！</p>
<p>名實相符的紀念城</p>
<p>抗戰紀念城中，除掉張家山的一座公墓外，再也找不出第二個紀念品了。未到紀念城的人，以爲她必定是有整齊淸潔的馬路，現代化的建築，爲內地數一數二的模節城市。記者在未到這座紀念城時，也是作如此想，可是一到衡陽，這座紀念城却顯得是一個汚　混亂，屎葉橫流的所在。</p>
<p>光復後的衡陽，又過遇飢荒，所以恢復得特別遲緩，雖然已設了市，也有市政府，但是市政辦得一無成績，大街上是一堆一堆的磚石和汚泥堆，溝渠敝開，汚水墨黑，臭氣四溢，黃泥沙鋪的馬路，雨天泥濘沒脛，晴天飛　敝日，交通要衢，兩旁經常排列著一些破舊的卡車，寬闊的馬路變成僅能容納一人行走的小道，若干馬路，雨天匯水成池，人行道上拖人力車，汽車駛在衡陽街上，竟有水陸兩樓之形。大街上的新建築物，有些伸展到路邊，有些又退後一些，參差不齊，有如犬牙交錯，說明這座城市的建設，一切都在自由發展。</p>
<p>然而，這座紀念城是名符其實的，高貸的危牆，到處皆是，馬路上的磚石泥堆，有似巷戰時用的陣得物，這些早就應該淸除的而不淸除，無疑是和保存古跡似的把這此戰時遺留的殘物保存著，以使市民不忘抗戰之苦，同時吿訴初到這座紀念城來觀光的人，認識這裏是眞正名符其實的抗戰紀念城。</p>
<p>打風與無爲而治</p>
<p>湖南的民性強悍，尤以湖南湘西爲甚。衡陽在湘南，所以打風特盛。三句話不對，打了再說。衡陽的塊方政府，頗有老子的「無爲而治」的精神，從來對「打」的案子沒有嚴厲徵辦一次，因此大家以「打」爲解決一切糾紛的不二法門。從春天到現在，這裏「打」的事件不下百次，其中有變次打死了人，最近一次扶輸中學體育敎員楊大展裁判球賽被毆斃，市府迄猶未能緝獲凶手，在衡陽的人司空見慣，對此案並不認爲如何嚴　，可是長沙體育界非常憤激。前天招待長沙新聞界，宣稱準備集體絕食請願，如不達目的，決組敢死隊百人到衡陽來武力捉拿凶手，假使演成這樣的局面，衡陽將又有一塲熱烈的「打」戲演出哩。</p>
<p>衡陽是有前途的</p>
<p>儘管衡陽現在表現得如何的無秩序，但衡陽還是有前途的。衡陽是明末大儒船山先生的故鄉，是個禮義之邦，現在的敎育也還發達，地方風氣雖然有可議之處，但這裏還有些淳樸古風，只要好好兒誘導，她將比通都大邑要好。至於衡陽市塲的繁榮，前　更不可限量，衡陽得地理之優，有四遍八連德公路網，有西南兩條大動派的粵漢湘桂鐵路，湘江　河也在此匯流，湘南各地的農產品　以衡陽市塲爲集散地，衡陽有足够的繁榮條件。自從上海申新紗廠　定衡陽東陽渡爲分廠廠址，東陽渡的人口增加了，湘桂路加　修築，下月可以通軍，從市區到車站沿途，也已不是一個月前那樣冷落了。市民對新衡陽的一幅達景，竟由憧憬而漸見事實。有人喻衡陽將來是東方的支加哥，這不是空話，確有其可能性，試再過幾年，我們來瞧一瞧吧！（特派員黃潮如）武夷勝蹟</p>

<h3>從敎授的立塲談談「罷課」</h3>
<p>— 彬彬</p>
<p>近來學校「罷課」幾乎成了「照例文章」，「日行公事」，一波未平，一波又起，上不了幾堂課，一學期的光陰就虛度了。有的是爲呼應別處的不幸事件（如杭州于姓學生自殺），有的是爲解決本身間題（如北平及唐山的兩個學院之要求「復大」），有的爲政治，有的爲國際。當事人與與論界大都只注意於學生與敎育常局間，或者靑年們與政府當局問，而忽略了「敎授」的一方面。所以老彬就親歷之備形談一談。</p>
<p>三方面合議，構成學校三要素。課者「課」也顧名思義，學校爲講學之地，上課，下課，授課，習課，乃敎授與學生間最密切之事，亦就是每一學校之所以成爲學校之基本條件。然而向來一提「罷課」，只聽說當局忙，學生忙，而敎授則依違其間，若有若無。直至今年春夏問，北平師大及北洋平部爲改校問題，學生會與敎授們意見不同，始由敎授會議另行表示各自行動。北洋平部之敎授會，且曾提議凡學校大事有關全局者應以三方面之合議決定之，即　學校行政各常局，　敎授會，　學生會，原因是三方面爲學校構成「三要素」。學生會之所爲旣不以「自治」爲限，則敎授會之職責亦不能限於課程講業之例行事件，此其一。敎授是聘任是師位，原與職員之純屬行政系統者不同，對於學生，對於當局，都有其自身的立塲，此其二。從前的敎授，沒有特別組織，現在旣有「敎授會」，當然有意義，與學生會同等的關心全局之意義。</p>
<p>以上按理論固爲確切不移，即在事實亦非此不可，請言其故：</p>
<p>是事實，不是法律，不是理論。正常的上課，停課，放假等事，向由校常局行政部照章辦理，而敎授及學生均依從行之。今之特別的停課（罷課）上課（復課），其種操於學生會，只要議決，則敎室空空，校當局無法勉强，敎授們無課可上，不罷亦罷，完全是事實問題。</p>
<p>「罷課」有目的，而學生會與敎授會之目的未必相同，學生會如認爲目的已達，議決復課，則敎授會的權威，便有表現之餘地了。</p>
<p>學生「罷踝」，敎室有敎授而無學生，則敎授不得不罷，固也。學生「復課」，而敎授則「罷教」，使敎室中有學生而無敎授，則學生之復課，又從何而復？此非虛擬之詞，半年以來，北平某某大學已經有此實情。敎授們不贊成罷課而不得不罷時，有云「好吧，罷課由你，復課由我，等到你們議決復課時再說。」正所謂任何方面都有個「此路不通」，此之謂以「事實答復事實」。</p>
<p>以上所述，是紀實的，是理智的，結論是「敎授會」對於學校大事之表現，應與「學生會」同等。這樣，於學校常局有益，於學生會亦未嘗無益，於泛濫的罷課，有調整節制之效能，於正當的有意義的罷課，有合同協力增加敎率之妙用。（未完）</p>

<h3>港勝利盾足球賽　華聯首戰勝軍聯　華聯前鋒銳利三比二獲勝</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕香港華人足球聯會，為紀念大戰勝利，舉辦勝利盾，決定由棄聯，軍聯參與奪標，賽程採積分計算，勝一次得兩分，假使在兩戰中，一勝一和，便可保有勝利盾一年。趁着英公主大婚的吉日佳期（十一月二十日），勝利盾展開第一次爭奮戰，結果，銅　畔華聯打得勝鼓回，前半時先勝三對一，後半塲輸回一隻，於是一球之差，軍觀飲恨。</p>
<p>球季開始以後，洋兵爲陣容欠妥的原故，從未一伸懷抱，軍縣屢屢排出陣勢。都是守强攻弱，加以今年華隊人材鼎證，軍聯的低頭，是意料中事。</p>
<p>這一戰，軍聯得正前濟維路重出，攻勢挺銳，進攻比前活躍，是洋丘八本年來的傑作，其所以敗，原因是雙方雖有同等的守衛力，但華聯人更好的前鋒綫。</p>
<p>雙方的門將，都表演出色，因此負球不多，進球次序：軍聯蕭維路先射中柱彈入，一比零，華聯朱永强進兩隻，郭英祺取一球，這是前半時的記錄。下半場，最後一分鐘，軍聯基亞能乘余啓恩倒地救球，再射一記，三比二終塲。兩隊陣容排出。如下：</p>
<p>華聯隊</p>
<p>謝錦洪（東方）劉松生（傑志）何應芬（傑志）余啓恩（中華）　孔慶煜（中華）黎兆榮（傑志）朱永强（東方）</p>

<p>華股見新高價　臨收突起回風</p>
<p>華股昨倍形飄忽，證金間題雖操生殺大權，但以金融性物品之刺激又起，疲後易俏，中途永紗再創四二九元及四三二元新高價，臨收仍疲。</p>
<p>晨開時，因報戰復有不能减低證金之訊，永紗開低至四○二元，旋又退至三九四元及三九七元低價。匯票掛大，買戶見殷，竟漲到即交四二三元，遞交四二四元高價。於是逢高了結，與趁低維持者，互相掙扎，塲外息價開高至二角二分半及二角七，銀根見緊，屢次退入四一○元內。午收爲四一六元及四二○元。較前收即交股計永紗景福華豐大通中紡火柴永公信誼小升，中法華新勤興景綸跌半成，統益中興尙平，國貨升半成，信和美亞新光闡北榮豐中絲中泥新華內衣小挫。遞交股華豐平，新光低半成，景福永紗微升，信和美亞勤興徽降。</p>
<p>後市圈外金融性物品重又俏麗，是以夜報雖有政院對證金未加討論之訊，上場仍開高價。即交四二九元，邇交四三二元。入後國行交換情形，乍入乍出，人心不定。大戶三二號時資時買，市價遂形恍惚，在四二二元至四三○元間徘徊不定。散多恐慌，復有貨款消息，臨收資風忽起，跌到四○五元低價。二○二號一八六號維持，收市爲四○六元及四○八元。結果校晨收即交股計美亞新光景福各跌半成，勤興閘北統益華盟永公尙平，中紡大通國貨景倫小升，新亞升半成，餘均微挫。遞交股計美亞新光景福跌半成，餘均微降。塲外各老股銀行股文化股尙穩，餘均平定。</p>

<p>外股昨受業外刺激而仍堅，熱股再現高價。怡紗長開三二五○○○元，高價達三五五○○○兀，而後回落至三四○○○○元左右轉徊。廣帮洋行帮有買，錢兌業有供，證劵帮先出後進。橡皮股尙穩，雜股較有參差。結果較前收計電車升一成，英聯會懲盟業廣航業鋼業漲半成左右，詳泰墾植跌一成，怡紗微升，紙版怡啤電話均平。</p>

<p>棉布市况，晨開以銀根仍緊，兼蓬紡建開售之期，市上高碼不無充裕，隔夜浮多了吐不寂，行情由平下挫。午後因有客帮乘低價進取，並聞美匯掛高，棉紗又創高盤，市場人心頓形激昂，喊價亦見重揚。迨至最後，十二磅龍頭等各擋細布，比上日均軋漲三。四萬元，嗶幾商貢客胃甚爲香燥，回高二。三。四萬元，其他各布，脚地亦均呈堅硬。</p>

<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市真系被面，大戰與筆強貨開市在九日二十萬元左右，一度降退至九百萬元關內，旋因多方乘低收吸，迄敢市又升至九百五十萬元，與上日下午收市行情相仿。下午因原料高昂，人心益發興奮，最後竟升達三千○八十萬元新高價，不過其他各貨，仍因實效有限，雖為成本關係，一致提升，漲勢比較緩和。</p>

<h3>今年百老匯走紅的劇作家安特森</h3>
<p>— 美國新聞處</p>
<p>今年七月中，好萊塢開始攝製「洛林的貞德」（Joana　oLorrainc）的電影劇本。同時麥克斯。安特森的另一個劇本將在百老匯上演，可能造成欣賞他劇作的觀衆的最高紀錄，安特森所寫爲淤史上有興趣與富於詩情的人物的劇本，是一九四六年至四七年紐約戲劇季最顯著的舞台收穫。這不僅因英格麗褒曼將貞德這一角色演的神妙，也因爲劇本本身使安特森有了提出過去多年許多人所感受的問題的工具，這些問題是：人可以相信什麼？</p>
<p>安特森的答案是個人良知的信條，它反對二十世紀所流行的權力的肓目崇拜。</p>
<p>「洛林的貞德」是戲劇不一定當作娛樂或消遣，也可以用此探討哲學與宗敎問題的證明，同時戲依然一樣可能成功。安特森主張所有他的戲劇都應該是他對於舞台該如何運用這種想法的範例。如果他有話要說，有問題要提出，那末劇本該是他發表的工具。</p>
<p>安特森於一八八八年十二月十五日生於賓夕文尼亞洲的大西洋城，早年由於家庭一再遷徙，由賓州遷往俄亥俄與衣阿華西州，而最後在北達科他州久住，曾隨地讀書。</p>
<p>他曾拒絕父親要他獻宗身敎的主張，早年就嗜愛寫作，他讀北達科他大學時，曾在大叉口地方充任一家報館的門房與侍役，藉此半工半讀。一九一一年他獲得文學士學位，然後担任敎職。他發言直率，當他與學生們討論和平主義時，立刻與他們發生爭論，因爲其時這問題還並不流行。</p>
<p>安特森離北達科他後，即前往西部，担任了史丹福大學的講師，一面講英文一面進硏究班深造。他在一九一四年得史丹福大學博士學位，並接任南加利福尼亞州惠第爾大學敎授。</p>
<p>他的直言無忌又與他的上司發生齟齬，於是又重返北達科他担任新聞工作，一度担任大叉口「前鋒報」編輯，不久就西去舊金山任「紀事報」的卞筆。可是他的直率言論又使他陷於科紛，終於被勸另覓別的工作。後來六年他一直在紐約工作，先在新共和報，後後入紐約環球夜報與世界晨報。</p>
<p>一九二三年五月，他看過「尋覓一個作家的六個人物一這齣戲之後，自己也變成了劇作家。他寫成了「白色沙漠WiliteDesart）一劇。這劇本極得批評家好評，但是在一般人看來還不是成功作。</p>
<p>後安氏與斯達林斯相遇，合寫了一本他作品中比較成功的一個劇本「光榮價値幾何」（Whatprice　Glory），曾於一九二四年九月三日在級約上演。以後他又寫成若干劇本，但都不怎麽成功，直到他的「星期六的兒童」一劇在一九二七年一月間在紐約上價後，採極負時譽。</p>
<p>自後幾年是安氏多產的年份，曾先後有「你兩所房子」（Both　Your　Houses），「懸岩」High　Tor）等名作。</p>
<p>當戰事危機日趨嚴重時，安特森曾設法，將他反對法西斯生活方式的思想寫成劇本。他曾以投效西班牙共和黨的美國靑年的故事爲題材寫成「慢調」（KeyLargo）一劇，後又以法國淪陷區的納粹政權爲題材寫成「風中之燭」（Candle　in　the　Wind）一劇，都不算大成功。一直到一九四二年，他寫成了一個傑作，那是美國關於戰時美軍的第一個好劇本。話劇題名「聖馬克之夜」（The　Eveof　St　Mjork），故事相當簡單，寫一個投軍的鄕村少年，裏面有句話說「爲了使這裏成爲自由人的地方，我們要是第一批作戰，第一批犧牲的人。」最近「洛林的貞德」一劇更使他又成爲名列前茅的劇作家。</p>

<h3>從水滸說起——談文學的演變</h3>
<p>— 郁影</p>
<p>水滸傳的前身是「宣和遺事」之類的平話，執筆者不止一二人，一百另八將的故事似乎也是傳說各異，並無一定的家譜，由於幾百年來的演化，於是便成爲「水滸傳」。猶之乎荷馬的史詩，其人物故事的來源，都求之於民間。經過大衆的；傳筆寫，人物故事自必有所增删，但越增删也就越見精彩，高爾基在「個性的毀減」一文中說：</p>
<p>「奧賽羅，哈姆雷特……一切這些典型都是在莎士比亞之先就創造了的。西班牙人民唱「生活是一夢」是在凱爾德郞寫它之前，而摩爾人又在西班牙人之前。騎俠美德是在西萬提斯的「吉訶德先生」之前就被民間故事嘲　過的。而且同樣的挖苦，同樣的凄切；彌爾頓和似丁，米茨凱維支，歌德和席勒，當他們從民間的詩歌的深不可測的源泉獲得啓示之時，當他們獲得了集體創造的智慧之時，他們就飛翔到最高的境界。」</p>
<p>任何典型的造象，都不能由一二詩人憑空塑造。阿Ｑ活在未莊，也活在中國大衆的心目中。「水滸傳」中的英雄，地痞，官僚，無賴，也都曾活現於常時人民的限前，由當時的無名作家及彈唱家刻劃着，描繪着，越演變越典型化，越突出，道就是「強有力的源泉」孕育了這批典型人物的緣故，也就是高爾基所說：獲得了集體創造的智慧。「水滸傳「作者，「唐吉訶德」作者，「奧賽羅」作者的寫作技巧於是也飛翔到「最高的境界」。</p>
<p>「自身就是目的」，這是藝術至上主義者的口號，文學的目的是什麼呢？大家都已在「正名」之際說過了，積極的，它是要使人類生活向上；消極的，它可以針對破壊者，打撃那些阻碍社會生活正常發展的人們。文學是藝術各部門之一種，而藝術的效用是在帮助創造新的人類，帮助克服那束縛新人類生長的東西。我想，文學家最重要的使命，就是擴大生活經驗，搜索民間故事及傳說，加以宣揚演化，——這是極必要的。</p>
<p>文學描寫的對象時常因了社會的變動，會起一種質的變化，廟堂文學的對象是帝王的身邊瑣事，經院文學的對象則是一二先哲的玄談，自古迄今，演變到目前的以人羣生活爲文學描述的對象，實在是走過了許多曲曲折折的道路的。即以同一人物論，舊時代詩人手下的農民，是自然的奴隸，那典型便多半是猥縮，多難，飽經磨折的人物，今日詩人筆下的農民，就已另換了一付樣子。</p>
<p>對過去的文學，無論是古典主義的，浪漫主義的，自然主義的，那道路總是我們的先人踏出來的，而事實上步履也確由散漫，遲緩，而堅强奮發起來了。新的題材在人類生活中日益被發掘，新的作家也就有更新的寫作技巧與生活經驗，他們來自民間，也熟悉民間，因此他們更易於接受民間的文學題材。拉弗列茨基以爲使舊的題材變質，這便是現實主義的勝利，嘗說：「對於人民的驚嘆，對於人民的力量和才能的醉心，代替了以前對於自然的順從的和消極的期待，這種期待大多是表現了對於人類的缺乏信心和對於社會進展的悲觀主義的態度」。</p>
<p>這都是極爲客觀的說法，我們可以明白，水滸傳在明人手中，牠的結局是「平四寇」，英雄一變而爲官僚；一入帮閑文人手裏，牠的結局便成爲「蕩寇志」所載，英雄都給殺光了。——文學的主題及技巧，意識及內容，無不由於時代的演變而演變着的</p>
<p>鄕野篇</p>
<h3>微遠</h3>
<p>— 路亭</p>
<p>十多年前，小山脚下大路旁的路亭是完整無缺的：一座小亭，朝西方向的亭口有一道相當高的土牆。夏天，疲乏的路人們沿着土牆坐在石櫈上休息，西來的太陽是晒不上人身的；風，却可以輕輕的拂過。冬天，坐在亭子裏，有老婦人　着山芋供路人充　，野草火也烘暖了每個路人的心。</p>
<p>如今，災荒連年，人禍不絕，路亭不但已早倒坍了屛牆，也漏遍每個亭角。夏天，裏面有荒草，濕水：……冬天灌飽了一屋子的寒風……除了你而有一隻野島「哇」的一聲從裏面驚飛而出外，路人已不再在那裏歇脚了……</p>
<p>呵，路亭已失去它的凉爽，溫暖，於是它在荒亂的土地上變得孤獨。</p>

<h3>健壽有術　我人何爲枉死</h3>
<p>— 美國LAVERINLADER著</p>
<p>吾人對於使用之汽車，須時時加以檢查，以防損壊，但於自己身體，何以須待病後方始注意，方始延醫，不亦晚乎！</p>
<p>某君從未生病，平時亦嘗運動，乃在辦公室忽然昏厥，一星期後，竟辭塵世，亭年不滿五十，如此死亡，實太不値得！蓋一切慢性疾病，潛滋暗長，患者多不自覺，但據醫學統計，若每年施行體格檢査，早期發現，及時治療，本可不致死亡，大多數之死亡，俱爲一種不必要之犧牲。吾人或自以爲體力甚健，步履若飛，毫無病態，殊不知大多數之殺人絕症，於事前多無警吿，及一且發覺，已太遲矣！約約生命延長硏究院約翰醫師報吿，在一千例自以爲健康之商人，正在購置汽車或地產，然其中祗有一百十四人爲眞正健康者，其中之十六例則患病均已相當嚴車，因眞正之殺人病症，大多數人都不加注意，故在不知不覺間，不知猛烈殺死多少人。</p>
<p>吾人爲健康計，爲避免太不値得之死亡計，曷不每年施行一次體格檢査，在時間與精神上毫無損失，而獲益無窮。撿査之價値，在預防疾病，摘發潛伏，許多絕症，若及早發現，極易治愈，例證甚夥，至檢査費用，亦不爲多，化戔戔之費，而博得健壽，又何樂不爲？處此科學昌明時代，若再枉死，不亦冤乎！</p>
<p>據醫學上之統計，每年無數死於癌症或肺結核等之病人，若彼等能及早牢記一事，則彼等必可多活若干年，此何事，非靈騐無匹之最新神效藥，亦非神妙莫測之醫術，僅爲一年一度之體格檢査耳。</p>
<h3>何時施行檢察</h3>
<p>— 秦廷棫</p>
<p>凡正式醫師，匯令病家，施行健康檢査，傳澈底明瞭其病原因，縮短治療時間。</p>
<p>凡病家就醫之前，應先至各醫院或病理檢騐所，取得詳細報吿，呈諸醫師，則對症發藥，事半攻倍，早復健康，安定生產。</p>
<p>在結婚之前，應施行健康檢査，傳雙方明瞭健康狀况，不特對於第二代優生上，有莫大之關係，直接免去日後種種悲慘之果，此舉尤不可忽。</p>
<p>凡時患咳嗽感冒，體重减輕，全身倦怠，而不自知共原因者，或有咯血，及急性傳染病以後，俱應施行全身檢査，以預防病症之潛伏。</p>
<p>凡健康之人，每年應施行全身檢査，在大都市之人民，甚易傳染疾病，蓋疾病之侵襲，每不爲人覺，尤以年靑人最爲危險。方之海中水雷，須勤加掃除，一旦爆發，悔之無及矣。</p>
<p>以丁惠康博士之愆見，凡患慢性疾病，三星期以上而不愈者，應立即施行全身健康檢査，以免眙誤自身，失去治療之黃金時機，實爲轉弱求强之扭轉點。故醫家應予以正當之指導，即病家亦須澈底明瞭，蓋一分之預防，勝於十分之治療。語云，宜未雨而綢繆，母臨渴而掘井。「身體乃個人資力總結算」，保陣健康，發展事業，所關尤大。</p>
<h3>美國靑年入伍百分之三十不及格</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統一九四五年在國會提議二經濟績利法案。此權利爲每一美國公民所應賦有者，一爲得到適當醫華治療，與享受健康之權利。一爲預防疾病，得有充分之保障。在一九四五年四月一日約有五百萬自十八歲至三十七歲之登記者，受體格檢騐後，認爲不能服軍役者，約占百分之三十。被拒絕入伍之靑年，並非不能工作，實囚其疾病與缺陷，可能阻礙或減低工作效能，或減短壽命，故對於今後每一靑年之身體，疾病或缺點，設法及早防治，近世醫藥日趨昌明，科學進步，雖云迅速，而每年仍有無數人民，枉死於可能防治之疾病，較全期戰爭中死傷損失，尤有過之。吾人必須堅認國民之健康，係國家之事業，如何防止病症少傳染，如何推進國民身體健康，此種可能性之認識與獲得，方能得到同樣勝利云。</p>

<h3>丘八詩譚</h3>
<p>— 范瘦梧</p>
<p>在譚「丘八詩」之前，我們得明瞭所謂「丘八」也者，不僅局限於某些人——現在征兵制實行人人有當丘八的義務——在古代天子以至於庶民，只要他身經汗馬，帶甲疆塲，所謂「行伍出身」者，皆可當得起「丘八」的稱號，從這樣的分類法裏，我可武斷地說：「丘八詩」的開山祖師，當推漢高祖劉邦；他的代表作：「大風起兮雲飛揚，威加海內兮　故鄕，安得猛士兮守四方」？（大風謌）頗足獨步千古。項羽的：「力拔山兮氣蓋世，時不利兮雛不逝，戰不逝兮可奈何，處兮！處兮！奈若何」？問世雖在劉邦大風之前，然究嫌其英雄末路，兒女情深，悱惻纏綿，已失却了「丘八詩」的本來面目，故於「丘八詩」壇盟主的抉擇，只好舍項歸劉，忍痛割愛。</p>
<p>至若李陵蘇武之詩，曹氏父子之詠，相沿而下，風流儒將之能詩者，何可數計？無不鑪錘百煉，格律謹嚴，與「丘八詩」的格調，大相枘盤，故置而不論；漢唐而下，涉獵百家，獨有宋藝祖——趙匡胤。微時嘗作「日」詩云：欲出未出光辣撻，千山萬山如火發，須臾走向天上來，趕却殘星趕明月」。老粗口吻，甲士雄吟，允推「丘八詩」中上乘。餘若明太祖朱元璋詠菊詩云：「百花開時我不發，我若開時都唬煞，要與西風戰一塲，滿身穿就黃金甲」。氣骨傲岸，有「伐鼓樅金」之聲勢，即李杜重生，何能道其隻字，此「丘八詩」之所以獨有千秋耳。</p>
<p>至於淸代稗史所載：雍正時，滿人某爲大將軍，某次，外放兩江，在京袍澤設筵祖餞，席問主人紛投贈別之作，引得將軍時興勃發，索紙大書一詩云：「老子打馬下江南，江南小子笑連迎，識得咱老子，大加一橫就是天」！意思是自吹一人之下，萬人之上，；然滿紙腥膻，俗不可奈，流爲「丘八詩」巾之魔道矣！</p>

<h3>冬季談銀耳</h3>
<p>— 秀堂</p>
<p>秋去冬來，在報紙的廣吿欄上，招攬銀耳顧客的廣吿，又佔了顯著的地位。銀耳屬担子菌類木耳族，寄生於潤葉樹類之朽處，春秋時期之雨後，發生結實體，大者二三寸，形如人耳。</p>
<p>銀耳寄生之樹多爲靑杠樹，冬夏之交，由山販子租山，將樹砍伐，盡削枝葉，再將樹幹砍成數段，每段長約二尺，然後擇泥土肥潤而不潮濕之地依次豎立，至舊歷五六月，經環境與氣候之培養，樹皮上即生木耳，此時即可將木耳摘下，去其渣滓與破爛者，並剪去樹皮，再經淘洗，復選一次，即成純潔之木耳，然後用火烘乾，大致優貨（夏季產者）每重一斤者，烘乾後僅重一兩，秋貨重四斤，烘乾後才得一兩，陳山貨（即上年產者）重八斤烘乾後僅得一兩，銀耳之所以價昂，其因即在此。</p>
<p>貪銀耳者，多調以糖，據醫者言，調以冰糖，或調以白糖，其効用各異，調以冰糖而食，可以瀾肺，化腸，化毛，調以白糖而食，則可治紅白疾疫，那女陰虛及婦科各病。是故富貴人家，在冬季或以食銀耳爲滋補佳品，但據化學家的分析，銀耳的營養素並不高，其分析的結果如下：</p>
<p>含水化合物　68.01％</p>
<p>脂肪　3.12％</p>
<p>蛋白質　6.51％</p>
<p>灰分　5.51％</p>
<p>鈣　0.643％</p>
<p>磷　0.250％</p>
<p>鐵　0.0304％</p>
<p>銀耳的蛋白質含量甚低，顯然沒有供給蛋白質的價値，含水化合物成份雖多，但是食物中絕沒有缺少這種營養素的可能，所以我們不必拿重價的銀耳，來供給這種隨處可得着的含水化合物。銀耳所含的無機鹽可以說是很多，最豐富的是鈣，其次是磷，鐵，不過我們拿道種價昂的食品來供給這稱礦質的來源，未免太不經濟了。</p>
<h3>繡帶兒　兩闋</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>福州萊嬰風盛，前幾日發現野狗咬食活嬰，猶記本年初，南京城內亦有同樣慘事。因念全國各地，棄嬰之多，時見報載，難保不爲狗食，人自不見，見亦無人報導，其未知數字，倘能統計，定駭聽聞，眞使人有「斯世不知何世「之感，爰塡此調，　作哀悼——</p>
<p>記得在南京，野狗食遺嬰，不料福州城裏，同樣狗猙獰！小命豈該輕忍心太？，硬把犧牲！是何時代？親生骨肉，沒愛無情！</p>
<p>豈止福州城，到處有遺嬰，時見報章連載，數字計難淸！野狗餓牙爭，多可怕，慘絕啼聲！生當末世，食人畜類，白畫橫行！</p>
<h3>「牢獄」里外</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>牢獄，誰都知道是爲有罪的人而設的。</p>
<p>一個人從自由天地，走進狹窄的獄門、當然是一種不幸，一種災害，一種悲劇。一個從未進過牢獄的人，是不會體騐到牢獄之外天地的遼闊；也唯有進過牢獄的人，纔會懂得牢獄生活的辛酸。</p>
<p>時無今古，地無中外，「牢獄」畢竟是沒有不同的。</p>
<p>明末顧大章記載他的牢獄生活，謂：「一入詔獄，聲息俱遙聞，不能覿面，是即死也」。何玉章云：「在昭獄寫單索飲食於外，譬如祖宗之顯靈；家人送食，譬如子孫之祭享」。於是終於慨然的嘆道：「非久困於獄者，焉能作此描畫乎」？</p>
<p>英國大文豪壬爾德因男色案件，過了兩年牢獄生活，因而引起他對牢獄的沉痛咒詛。他說：「人類的牢監，個個都是川着恥的磚造成的，而圍着柵欄爲了恐怕基督看見人們怎樣把弟兄虐待」。又說：「牢獄的組織，是絕對地完全地錯誤的」。</p>
<p>事實又偏是如此，「有悲哀的地方，就是有神聖的地方」。人們從自由天地投進「不自由」的牢監，當然感到最痛苦，但痛苦未　不是一種啓示，人們靠了牠，纔能認識從前所沒有認識過的事物。</p>
<p>顧大章因爲一舟忤拂魏忠醫，被陷害入獄，結果終不免爲魏閹所搆害。但他的志節却愈挫愈堅，沒有向魏閹乞憐投降。</p>
<p>王爾德出獄之後，也自己承認這是他一生中間第二迴轉期，他竭盡心力，寫成了最後傑作「婁登監獄之歌」。人們公認這是他二年間在牢獄中迎接了人生的悲慘而殘酷的現實以後產生的作品，它是充滿着人道的感情。甚至將它拿來與但丁的地獄篇比美，而贊賞他爲「用英語著作的最優美的歌了」。</p>
<p>自然，世間決沒有人會用這些事實去鼓勵別人走進牢監；否則，除非是一個瘋子纔會這樣做。而且，歷來也不會有一個人自動地投進監牢，去「享受」那種人間地獄的痛苦。可是，時至今日，現實竟令人太可怕了，據滬上報載，號稱東方巴黎的上海，居然發生一窮途落魄靑年，於走頭無路之際，自投法院，堅請入獄的事。這豈僅是叫人可怕，不免也叫人陡興「人問何世」之感！</p>
<h3>人類的五大危險</h3>
<p>— 柴扉</p>
<p>哈佛大學天文台主任著名的雪普萊博士最近宣稱：人類文化正遭受强大的物理學與軟弱的社會學的威脅，抱頭而竄，幾無地自容。博士以幽默口吻更進而指陳人類的五大危險：「欲掌握現在與將來導引世界趨向滅亡的鬼才，絕滅慾望或再生能力的麻醉品；有閒而覺得無聊；勾心鬥爭迫使新戰爭爆發的超越武器；遍及世界各地的瘟疫。」</p>
<p>博士認爲要克服人類五大危險，應在聯合國科學文化委員會叔導下，訂立全球不分上下的普及敎育計劃，並以强力爲後盾，積極實施。雪普萊說：如果我們沒有辦法做到這一點，我們欲脫離鬼才的堂握唯一自救之道，只有將生下來即有天才特微的嬰兒，殺得乾乾凈凈</p>
<p>美國小姐</p>
<h3>美國小姐過生日</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>因爲女人的靑春特別寳貴，所以對於生日特別重視。美國物質文明超過任何國家，美國小姐對於過生日尤其不肯放鬆，她們在事先並不發帖子，却遇到熟人時便口頭通知，大抵總是說；「某月某日是我的生日，請你到我家裏來玩，「比較熟識的便問：「你打算送些什麽給我？」有時候她老實不各氣，指定你送她一隻粉盒或一支名貴鋼筆，甚至一隻手錶，一件銀狐大衣，那要看交情如何了。送手錶和銀狐大衣的限於肌膚之親的，如夫妻愛人等等，普通朋友送一張（Birtheday　Card）也就算盡了人情，送厚禮極少數，送卡片的佔多數，她把卡片黏貼在一本照相簿或廢紙簿（Scrap　Book）上，作為一種有意義的紀念物。父母對於女兒的生日，尤其是十七歲或二十歲的生日，有送寳石生日戒的，有送皮大衣的，有送鋼琴的更有送汽車的，你不要以爲送鋼琴和汽車是什麼了不得的事，鋼儘僅値美金二三百元。一九四七年型汽車約美金一千六七百元。</p>
<p>在生日的那天，特定生日餅（Cake）一大只，有人送來，便不必自備，餅上插了許多白蠟燭（Birthday），邀了許多親戚同學鄰居來開派對，吃（Cockail）（洋涇浜英語專家歸成鷄尾酒），按例諸位來賓圍生日餅而立，手裏拿着碟子，由美國小姐一口氣將所有的蠟燭吹滅，然後分食生日餅，餅吃過或者招待晚膳，或者祇備茶點，開派對跳舞，每個來實必須和常事人跳一次，以示人到禮到，往往跳得她兩脚酸痛，跳破幾雙玻璃絲襪也是常有之事。</p>
<p>中等家庭的小姐，過一次生日，可以收到許多的禮物，你說她們違背節約原則嗎？那眞是吹毛求疵的話。因爲禮物都是實用品，並不曾浪費，美國人決不送花節銀盾，也不借手於傭人，所以賞錢一項支出是沒有的。我認爲禮義　恥中的禮是很重要的，送禮當然也得包括在禮之中，否則打拱作揖了事，未免那種禮流於虛僞，虛僞便是無恥。簡約運動應限於實用的禮，而並非把體打倒，我們不健亡心的話，主席生辰也有人鑄造金像，這不是「禮」嗎？不過奸商們抬高物品的售價，政府應當予以制裁，但不要祇說不做，否則便請免開尊口（十）（六）</p>

<p>本報與人和·紅十字會第一醫院·尙賢·保黎等四醫院聯合！辦的「貧婦助產」運動，一切費用向由各合作醫院與本報平均負担，換句話說，就是每一個產婦所費的醫藥費用，醫院當局負担一半，本報也負担一半。隨着社會的需要，「貧婦助產」運動一天天的擴大起來，與我們合作的醫院，已經由「人和」一家增加到四家，但同時我們也而臨着一個迫切的問題——經費問題。本報的助產經費，一向由熟心的讀者源源捐助，但由於幣値的變遷，和醫療器材的不斷高漲，我們經常的爲預算不能平衡而担憂。幸　金華豐先生在我們感覺困難的時候，給予我們熱烈的鼓勵和支援，他慨然認捐每個月本報所應負担的助產費用。十月份「人和」與「尙　」二醫院經辦的助　費用是一二，五八七，五〇〇元，本館應付半數計六。二九三。七五〇元，此款已由金先生如數付來，由本關　球該兩院照收。至於保黎和紅十字會第一醫院的</p>

<h3>Internal Telegram to All Provincial Governments to Expedite Household Registration</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Ministry of Interior recently sent a telegram to all provincial governments stating that household registration work had been universally carried out in safe counties and cities in the 36th year, but the areas where communist bandits roamed and remote provinces and regions were unable to conduct it in a timely manner. Those that had been carried out were also affected by the mobilization for suppressing the rebellion and were unable to reach the ideal stage. The 37th year is a year of simultaneous bandit suppression and constitutional government, and a complete household registration book is necessary as a basis. All provincial administrative plans for the 37th year should still list household registration as the central task. Those who have not yet done so should speed up the process, and those who have already done so should find ways to improve it. The ministry also provided five key points, requesting implementation: Counties and cities that were recovered in the second half of the 36th year, and safe counties and cities that failed to complete registration in the 36th year due to various reasons, should complete household registration in the first half of the 37th year. Those recovered in the first half of the 37th year should complete household registration in the second half of the same year. Counties and cities that have completed household registration should continue to carry out various dynamic registrations. Under the principle of no missing households or people, special attention should be paid to the registration of births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. Lists of strong men and national soldiers in each county and city should be completed by April of the 37th year. Select one or two counties and cities with the best demonstration and competition results in the 36th year to conduct demonstrations, and where funds are sufficient, efforts should be made to adopt card registration. Continue to conduct competitions in accordance with the "Implementation Measures for the Household Registration Work Competition" promulgated by the ministry.</p>
<h3>Huangpu, Guangzhou Suburbs</h3>

<h3>Election Disputes in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 25th] In Lin Sen County, the ballot boxes from the Rongqiao and Shuangxiang polling stations were stolen by voters on the afternoon of the third day of the election, preventing other voters from casting their ballots, causing disputes.

The situation is very serious. The county party headquarters has repeatedly requested the provincial government to send security teams to suppress the violence.

<h3>Adjustment of District Assignments Needed for Legislative Yuan Candidates from Two Parties; Kuomintang Invites Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties for Further Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Regarding the list of Legislative Yuan candidates from political parties, the three parties are scheduled to meet at Sun Ke's residence at 10:00 AM on the 26th to discuss the matter. After the Kuomintang received the preliminary lists from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee's election guidance committee held a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 25th to discuss the matter. The two parties had nominated candidates for over 40 districts, but neither party had nominated candidates for certain districts. Therefore, assigning districts was very difficult, and the issue of the number of seats also needed to be agreed upon. The joint committee nominated Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and others to continue negotiating with the two parties on the 26th. It is also learned that after receiving the lists from the two parties, the Kuomintang had sent a joint letter to the two parties, signed by Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, and Chen Lifu, explaining the issue of duplication and requesting changes. Otherwise, the two parties would be allowed to freely compete in the same district. People from both parties found this difficult to resolve, so the list could not be submitted on the 25th.

<h3>Xu Fu-lin to Suggest Postponing Election of Control Yuan Members</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The central government originally scheduled the election of Control Yuan members from November 16 to December 10, but the regulations for the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties to participate in the provincial and municipal councils have not yet been officially promulgated by the National Government. As a result, the two parties have not been able to nominate candidates. Since Control Yuan members are elected by the councils, if the two parties cannot participate in the councils, they will not be able to participate in the election of Control Yuan members. Recognizing this, Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party told reporters on the 25th that he intends to suggest that the authorities extend the election deadline so that members of both parties can participate in the councils.</p>

<h3>Members of Legislative and Control Yuans and People's Political Council Jointly Visit Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Presenting Opinions on National Assembly General Election</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Six representatives of the Kuomintang from the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and People's Political Council jointly met with Chairman Chiang less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the National Assembly representative elections to express their dissatisfaction with the election process and concerns that it would harm the Kuomintang's reputation. It is reported that the Kuomintang candidates' registration method was quite unfair, regardless of their personal morality, knowledge, or qualifications. As long as they had a "backer" in the Central Party Headquarters, they had hope. On the contrary, current representatives of the Kuomintang in the Legislative Yuan and the People's Political Council were not included in the list of candidates because they did not have such a backer. If such malpractices are not corrected, they will have an extremely bad impact on the Kuomintang. After meeting with Chairman Chiang, a Kuomintang representative told reporters that the chairman promised to correct this during the nomination of candidates for the Legislative Yuan so that those with high moral character and prestige can be included.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Party Member Registration Extended for One Month</h3>

<h3>Dewey Urges Emergency Aid to China; Calls on U.S. to Explore Bipolar Containment Policy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 24th] New York Governor Dewey on the 4th called on the government to explore a bipartisan containment diplomatic policy, saying: Only a small amount of emergency aid of one hundred million could save a free China.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] Republican New York Governor Dewey, speaking tonight at a reunion of graduates of the Columbia University Law School, said: The US government has gone bankrupt by pivoting on China policy, and if China is not aided, its 450 million freedom-loving people may fall into Communist hands. The United States and other countries opposed to dictatorship are now under attack in various ways, but have not yet gone to war. The Communist conquest of the world controlling the freedom-loving nations, the largest of which is China, is progressing very quickly. The original "cold war" has turned into a "hot war" in Europe, and is getting even hotter and getting closer to hand in China. In this critical world, we must do something. It would be inconceivable for us to say that after winning the war, we will hand over the fruits of victory and allow free nations to fall into economic disarray and accept Soviet control. But if 275 million people in Western Europe are important, then in my view, the 450 million people in China are also extremely important. The President's emergency aid plan to Congress last Monday did not mention China at all, which was a great disappointment to me. This is completely unimaginable in the midst of a crisis that is about to lose a free China.</p>
<p>Dewey advocated including an emergency aid of US$75 million to $100 million to China in the temporary relief bill for Europe currently being discussed in Congress. Aid to China had been considered for three or four years, with annual aid of $250 million to maintain China's economic life so that it could engage with the Communists. Army surplus material from the Pacific should also be transported to China for relief. Dewey also acknowledged that the current government of China may have unsatisfactory aspects, but said that the government is also fighting alongside us on the side of human freedom against brutal dictatorship. Dewey concluded by saying that if China falls, all of Asia will be lost, and at that time Western Europe and North and South America will inevitably be helpless in an environment where the whole world is the enemy.</p>
<h3>Truman Did Not Mention Aid to China, Vandenberg Expresses Regret</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, revealed while speaking in the Senate on President Truman's proposed emergency aid bill to Europe that the State Department will soon submit a separate aid plan to China to Congress and expressed regret that the plan proposed by President Truman did not request aid to China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] Three Republican senators quickly expanded the United States' foreign aid program to include Asia. Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriation Subcommittee, warned that the emergency aid program to Europe should be consistent with needs elsewhere and that Asia should also be included. Senator Vandenberg said that post-war restoration plans should be extended to other countries, including those that have been disarmed for a long time. Senator Morse told the Senate that aiding the world, including the people of Europe and Asia, is the only hope, "We cannot focus all our attention on Europe and allow the Communists to encircle the Pacific. The situation in China is dire, and the law has failed. In order to expand international justice and protect national interests, it is necessary to aid the Far East countries. China, the Philippines, and Korea have shouldered the heavy burden of war when we were fully engaged in war in Europe and are in urgent need of aid today. The importance of the Soviet Union is the same in Europe and Asia, and it is time for the government to make clear its attitude towards Asia."</p>
<h3>Pakistan and New Zealand: ECOSOC Approves Membership; Allied Headquarters Suggests Japanese Economic Policy Not on Agenda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baguio, 25th] The Asian and Far Eastern Economic Commission met at 10:00 AM on the 25th and adjourned at 12:50 PM. The discussion mainly focused on the passage of the opening agenda. The meeting unanimously agreed to allow Pakistan to join as a member state. All member countries attached great importance to the recent political changes in the Far East, so the commission discussed the status of the Korean delegation at the beginning. The United Kingdom proposed to decide the status of the Korean delegation this afternoon and passed it with eight votes to zero. At the afternoon meeting, chaired by Jiang Tingfu, it was unanimously passed to request the United Nations Economic and Social Council to allow New Zealand to join the Far Eastern Economic Commission as a member state. It also allowed four auxiliary members, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Malaya (including the Malay Federation, Singapore, North Borneo, Brunei, and Sarawak) to attend the meeting, but without voting rights. The meeting on the 26th will consider the applications for auxiliary membership submitted by France for Cambodia and Laos.</p>
<h3>The Korean Representative's Attendance Issue: Soviet Opposition Rejected</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Baguio, 25th] The second conference of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, on the 25th, discussed the Soviet representative Mr. Stetsenko's proposal to exclude the issue of the commission's relationship with Korea from the agenda. The proposal was rejected by a vote of nine to two. The representative from Korea was not allowed to participate in the vote, pending a decision on whether the committee would recognize the new government of that country. Another Soviet proposal, which argued that the issue of the commission's relationship with a certain country's commissioner's office in Southeast Asia should be excluded from the agenda, was also rejected by the same vote. In addition, the Soviet proposal that the note from MacArthur's headquarters regarding Japan's economic policy should be excluded from the agenda was passed unanimously. Chairman Chiang Ting-fu then announced that the issue of inviting a representative from Korea to attend would remain on the agenda, but the committee could revise it at any time.</p>

<h3>The Call of the Asian People!</h3>
<p>-- Commenting on the speeches of the Philippine President and our Chinese Representative --</p>
<p>The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its second conference in Baguio, Philippines, on the 24th. Representatives from ten countries, including China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, India, and Australia, have all arrived in the Philippines. Mr. Vauven, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Social and Economic Council, also traveled from the United States to the Philippines to preside over the opening ceremony. Philippine President Roxas, in his capacity as host, first welcomed the representatives of various countries and called on all countries not to neglect Asia and the Far East. He solemnly stated that the people of Asia should receive international assistance to establish a sound industry, thereby promoting the happiness and prosperity of all mankind. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Conference, namely our Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu, delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of Asian economic problems, recognizing this as the root of all problems, and taking the eradication of the basic causes of poverty as the urgent task of Asian countries. At the same time, he pointed out that within the Asian region, no country can benefit from the poverty of other countries, but the prosperity of any country is enough to benefit all other countries. The speeches of Roxas and Chiang can be regarded as the common voice of the Asian people. They are worthy of attention from wealthy countries, especially the United States, which is hesitant to provide aid to Europe and Asia. They should pay special attention to this call from the depths of the hearts of the Asian people!</p>
<p>Although the main purpose of establishing the Economic Commission for the Far East is to focus on economic aspects and is not a kind of international conference with political functions, its task is only to: 1. Increase the production capacity of various countries in the Asia and Far East region: 2. Improve the living standards of the people of various countries in the Asia and Far East region: 3. Seek economic cooperation between countries in the Asia and Far East region and economic cooperation between this region and other regions of the world. But its ultimate role is not limited to the economic aspect, but also has a very important impact on politics. Because in today's world, politics and economics are inseparable. Political stability often depends on the resolution of economic problems; conversely, economic stability also depends on political openness and progress: Therefore, we have always believed that the tasks undertaken by the Economic Commission for the Far East are very important. Looking back at the first conference of the Economic Commission for the Far East held in Shanghai, our country's government and people paid great attention to it. However, the nature of the first conference was a preparatory meeting, which only studied the economic losses suffered by various countries in Asia and the Far East during the war, in order to provide suggestions on how to restore the economic situation of those countries, thereby establishing normal economic relations between countries, and that was all. As for how to enable countries to seek stability from economic recovery? How to promote economic cooperation between countries in the Far East to seek the prosperity of the Far East? And how to strengthen the economic ties between the Far East region and other regions of the world? These are the main topics of this Far East Economic Conference. Therefore, we have particularly high expectations for this meeting.</p>
<p>Today, the countries in Asia and the Far East are all devastated and severely damaged after the war. Everywhere is full of tragic scenes. The sad faces of the Asian people can be imagined without any description. The representatives of ten countries are now in Baguio, Philippines, no different from being in a city of sorrow in Asia. Whether it is what the eyes see or what the ears hear, all are the situations of hardship and distress of the Asian people. Now that the Far East Economic Commission is committed to promoting economic cooperation among countries and seeking the prosperity of all countries, the most important thing is naturally that the representatives of the ten countries can face the reality of Asia, prescribe the right medicine, and provide practical and effective suggestions, so that all countries in Asia and the Far East can get out of the sea of suffering and step into the realm of revival and prosperity as soon as possible. We do not underestimate theories and plans, but we always feel that any high-sounding but unrealistic suggestions will not help the actual situation of countries in Asia and the Far East. Therefore, we have to boldly and frankly point out that in today's Asia and the Far East region, which is full of desolation, if we want to talk about economic recovery and prosperity but cannot get the full assistance of wealthy and powerful countries, then any perfect plan is no different from empty talk on paper and will never produce good results. This is an objective fact that cannot be controlled by subjective opinions. We do not intend to make the countries in Asia and the Far East dependent on the economic assistance of wealthy countries, but the cruel war destroyed the material conditions of the countries in Asia and the Far East, making them in need of external assistance.</p>
<p>We believe that the responsible authorities in the United States have long had the same understanding of the situation of various countries in the world after the war, whether they are European countries or Asian countries. President Truman, seeing the economic crisis in European countries in April and May of this year, in order to prevent them from collapsing, specifically proposed to Congress a plan to provide economic assistance to European countries: Later, because Congress was hesitant to make a decision, and the economic situation of European countries was getting worse and worse, President Truman had to convene a special session of Congress so that Secretary of State Marshall's emergency aid plan for Europe could be passed as soon as possible, implemented as soon as possible, and alleviate the suffering of the European people as soon as possible. This generous spirit of the United States is worthy of our admiration and praise. However, the US authorities are well aware that the economic situation in Asia is also very critical, and its extent even exceeds that of Europe. The Asian people who are struggling and groaning on the hunger line are a hundred times or a thousand times more than the European people. However, the US authorities still turn a blind eye and remain indifferent. So far, there has been no discussion of a plan to provide economic assistance to Asia. The US government and the public may use the theory of "Europe First" to explain this, but we want to tell the US government and the public that since the foundation of the US domestic prosperity is completely based on overseas markets, they must understand that there is no such thing as "the world is poor but I am rich" in the US economy. If the countries in Asia continue to struggle in hardship for a long time, and the United States does not provide economic assistance in time, then the productivity of the countries in Asia will not be able to increase, and the living standards of the people will not be able to improve. To talk about international economic cooperation is like a fool talking in his sleep. Even if the Economic Commission for the Far East holds meetings from time to time and passes many nice-sounding plans, it will be in vain and will not solve the economic problems of the Far East.</p>
<p>In short, what the poor Asian countries urgently need today is not empty plans, nor is it the beautiful and moving speeches of diplomats, but material assistance and technical cooperation. First, let them recuperate and restore their vitality, and then they can take a further step to seek the industrial modernization of their industries and jointly seek the stability and prosperity of the world economy. This task requires the United Nations organization to make its greatest efforts to complete it; but we ultimately hope that the political diplomats of the United States will broaden their horizons, not ignore the importance of the countries of Asia, and be able to expand the aid plan for Europe to Asia? To jointly seek the revival of Europe and Asia. In recent days, the leaders of the US Republican Party have been giving speeches to the people everywhere, all talking about aiding Asia and China, which shows that the call of the Asian people has not only won the sympathy of the American people, but has also aroused the resonance of some American politicians. May the US authorities pay special attention to the call of the Asian people!

<h3>Vessels Looted by Japan to be Returned to China by the End of the Year; Two Factories to be Shipped at the Same Time</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] News on the 25th: Two Chinese factories and five ships (including a 10,000-ton oil tanker) looted by Japan during the war have recently been found in Japan and will be returned to China by the end of the year. In addition, four of the nine national treasures, including a valuable Han Dynasty Yellow Dragon Plate map version in 188 boxes, and 14,817 ancient books, will also be returned when transportation is convenient. Among the factories to be returned is the complete equipment of the Tianjin Sanjia Board Company, which was looted from Tianjin in 1944. There is also property from the Shanghai Parker Davis Pharmaceutical Factory. The company's machines include: one pill-making machine, one electric drying machine, four sugar-coating pots, one copper steam pot, one filter press, and six mixing wheels. The machines in the two factories are in good condition, except for a few lost parts. Among the five ships to be returned is the 10,000-ton oil tanker "Hainan," which was confiscated by our government near Hainan Island from Japanese property after Japan surrendered. The ship was temporarily used for the purpose of repatriating Japanese, and after repeated negotiations, the Allied Headquarters finally decided to return it to China. The ship is currently docked in Nagasaki and is no longer navigable. It is expected that our country will send a tugboat next month to tow it to Shanghai for repairs. The other four ships are: the 2,080-ton "Eldorado," the 1,946-ton "Mao Li," the 2,000-ton "Hai Wen," and the 1,000-ton "He Xing" (all four ship names are translated). The last two ships were sunk by the Japanese after the surrender, and a maritime survey team will be dispatched to investigate whether the two ships can be floated.</p>
<h3>Jilin Temporary Council Questions Provincial Affairs</h3>
<p>Resolution to Investigate the Reason for the Fall of Shijiazhuang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The Jilin Temporary Council continued its meeting on the morning of the 25th. After Jilin Provincial Government Secretary-General Zhang Aisong gave a general report on provincial affairs, council members raised questions one after another, focusing on thoroughly investigating corruption and seeking the development of provincial affairs. The main points are as follows: Several commissioners, directors, and county heads who were reported and removed from office for investigation have not had any results, and corrupt officials are still at large. Does the provincial authorities have the determination and plan to develop provincial affairs? How to ensure the safety of major strongholds such as Pingjinbao? The provincial government is nominally located in Baoding, but it actually operates in three places: Ping, Bao, and Fengtai, which disperses administrative efficiency. The day after Shijiazhuang fell, various departments of the provincial government moved to Ping, causing panic, and the Supervisory Council also took refuge in Beiping. There is no overall plan for the provincial government to mobilize to suppress the rebellion. Not only has it not prohibited apportionments, but it has intensified them. Simplification of institutions has not been implemented. A certain council member pointed out the situation of the provincial government's accounting director appointing personal friends, saying that his great aunt is his confidential commissioner and section chief, and his second aunt, Yin, and the commissioner's wife handle general affairs. In addition, there are also problems such as Tangshan refugees still sleeping in single clothes in this severe winter, and the administrative power of mining supervision. The questioning continued in the afternoon. After the provincial government secretary-general gave a general response, Civil Affairs Director Sun Zhenbang reported, emphasizing the achievements of local teams, saying that in terms of work style, it has been decided to designate the 11th commissioner district in the Pingjinbao triangle area as a model innovation area, pay attention to military force, and appoint county heads regardless of qualifications, only asking whether they are competent, and implement new methods to solve the land problem. The meeting also passed a resolution to send telegrams to Chairman Chiang and the soldiers who are suppressing the rebellion to express their respect. In addition, representatives of refugees who escaped from Shijiazhuang went to petition, and it was decided to discuss with the provincial government to allocate funds for relief and to thoroughly study the reasons for the fall of Shijiazhuang based on the refugees' reports.</p>
<h3>Jilin Provincial Government Allocates 50 Billion to Handle Post-Fall Affairs in Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Jilin Provincial Government Secretary-General reported at the Temporary Council that the Jilin Provincial Government has a plan to develop provincial affairs and will greatly increase local military force. In order to handle the post-fall affairs in Shijiazhuang, the provincial government has allocated 50 billion in emergency measures funds and another 1 billion to reserve grain for public students in Baoding for use in times of emergency.</p>
<h3>Ping-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises More Than Double, Prices Soar</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Today, the Shanghai exchange rate suddenly jumped more than double, generally exceeding 100 yuan. Yesterday, the opening price of each bank in the city was still more than 50 yuan. Today, as Tianjin reported a rise, the Ping market rose accordingly. The two sides agreed to trade at 80 yuan. From 11:00 to 12:00, Tianjin rose again, and the Ping market jumped to 100 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 110 yuan, more than double the price this morning. The Central Bank's Shanghai exchange rate of 45 yuan could not be maintained in the market. The sudden rise in the Shanghai exchange rate was due to the fact that the foreign exchange price of each bank in Shanghai was smaller than that of Pingjin. The price increase in Ping was too great in two days, and the gap with Shanghai was too large. For example, the price of naval ship flour was 470,000 in Ping, but only 262,000 in Shanghai, which encouraged a large flow of funds to the south. In addition, the prices in Ping are still soaring today. Some stores are shouting 500,000 for first-class local bagged flour, 9,400 for a catty of rice, 1.24 million for Wufu, and 56 million for 42-count yarn. The price of gold and US dollars has also risen sharply.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 25th] After the fall of the factory gate, prices in Tianjin suddenly rose. Recently, the situation has become even worse.

<h3>Measures for Grain Circulation Will Be Implemented Immediately in Six Provinces and Four Cities</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan has recently formulated measures for grain circulation and decided to implement them immediately in six provinces - Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan - and four cities - Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Chongqing. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: These measures are specifically formulated in accordance with the Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government for the Completion of the Mobilization to Suppress Rebellion for the management of grain circulation.</p>
<p>The area of implementation of these measures is temporarily limited to the six provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan in the Yangtze River basin and the four cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Chongqing.</p>
<p>The grain referred to in these measures includes four types: rice, wheat, and flour.</p>
<p>Article 2: Grain in the provinces along the Yangtze River should be freely circulated. Those who transport it out of the Yangtze River estuary must obtain approval from the Ministry of Food and be inspected by customs.</p>
<p>Article 3: For the transportation of grain out of the Yangtze River estuary, legal grain merchants should report the types and quantities of grain, the region of purchase to the final destination, and submit the grain merchant's license (or a photograph of the license). After obtaining approval from the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Food will notify the local government of the purchase location and inform the local Grain Association.</p>
<p>The maximum amount of grain that each grain merchant can report for transportation each time is limited to 5,000 shi of rice, 10,000 shi of grains, and 3,000 shi of wheat. However, they are not allowed to purchase the aforementioned approved grain for transportation in Shanghai and Nanjing. The merchant should report to the Ministry of Food for approval of the transportation permit before loading.</p>
<p>Article 5: The transport of flour out of the Yangtze River estuary from various provinces and cities along the Yangtze River will be subject to a quota system. The Ministry of Food will approve the quota each month. If a guild has been established, the Ministry of Food will comprehensively approve the quota based on the total production of the area, and the guild will allocate it proportionally to each factory that has started operation. A detailed list of the factory name, trademark (or brand name), allocation amount, and the destination of each factory should be submitted in five copies to the Ministry of Food for approval.</p>
<p>When legitimate grain merchants report the transportation of flour, they should purchase it from the factory within the allocation amount of each factory. The factory must not raise prices or sell it to brokers.</p>
<p>Article 4: Manufacturers of the Fourth District Flour Industry Association who have opened factories outside the implementation area are not subject to these measures.</p>
<p>Article 6: When the Ministry of Food receives the flour allocation list from the various district guilds, it should approve the transportation permit according to the factory, stating the flour trademark (or brand name), the amount of transportation, the origin and destination, and send the original list to the Ministry of Finance and directly notify the relevant customs for inspection.</p>
<p>Article 7: The transportation permit issued by the Ministry of Food is valid for one month from the date of issuance. Those who fail to ship the goods within the time limit will be deemed invalid.</p>
<p>Article 8: All government agencies that purchase grain in the implementation area to transport it out of the Yangtze River estuary should first report the types, quantities, and uses to the Ministry of Food for approval, and the Ministry of Food will designate the area for purchase.</p>
<p>Article 9: All ships carrying grain should check the transportation permit issued by the Ministry of Food to verify that the origin and destination and the type and quantity of grain are consistent. This transportation permit should be carried with the manifest (if it is flour, it must be accompanied by a tax payment certificate) for customs inspection and release.</p>
<p>Article 10: If the customs discovers grain that has been transported out of the Yangtze River estuary without the approval of the Ministry of Food, it will be treated as smuggling, handled in accordance with the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, and the seized grain will be handed over to the local grain authority for temporary storage.</p>
<p>Article 11: The Ministry of Food may organize a review committee to handle the review of reports for transportation. The organizational regulations will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Article 12: These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Has Not Yet Been Decided, Bevin Presides Over the Opening Ceremony, the Eve of the Conference is Full of Harmonious Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[News From Our Newspaper] London, 25th, Broadcast: The sixth session of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will be inaugurated here at Lancaster House at 3:30 PM today (Greenwich Time, 11:30 PM Shanghai Time), and the opening ceremony will be hosted by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. The primary task of this conference is to discuss the Austrian peace treaty. The United Kingdom and the United States seem to be adopting a more moderate attitude in order to reduce the fierce dispute between the East and West. The first issue to be resolved at the conference is the agenda issue, as the representatives of the four major powers have failed to reach an agreement on this issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference, which is related to the "Fate of Europe," opened today. When U.S. Secretary of State Marshall arrived at the venue, the crowd cheered. Mr. Marshall and his entourage arrived at the conference earliest and were in very good spirits. He told reporters, "I am very confident at the moment." Molotov was also cheered by the crowd. Bevin and Bidault arrived almost simultaneously and walked into the venue side by side. Reporters were not able to listen in at the venue, and the details of the first meeting are yet to be released.</p>
<p>[News From Our Newspaper] London, 25th, Broadcast: After the foreign ministers of the four countries arrived at the venue one after another, the military commanders of the British, American, and Soviet occupation zones in Germany, General Robertson, General Clay, and Marshal Sokolovsky, also arrived one by one. Clay was in casual clothes. Clay's political advisor, Murphy, accompanied him.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] British officials announced today that Foreign Secretary Bevin had a very pleasant meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last night. Both sides acknowledged that the unity of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is extremely important not only for Germany and Austria, but also for the future of the world. Bevin will follow the established policy of drawing the United States and the Soviet Union closer together, and his attitude will be more moderate than that of U.S. Secretary of State Marshall. Bevin also visited and met with Mr. Marshall last night. Security has been increased around the venue, and all idlers are subject to close surveillance or questioning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Marshall and Molotov on the night of the 24th in an attempt to resolve the difficulties regarding the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Foreign Minister Bidault immediately joined the talks after arriving in London yesterday. The scope, procedure, and timing of the conference are still unknown to outsiders. Because the foreign ministers' representatives have failed to agree on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held without an agenda. Although the agenda has not been set, the tasks of the Foreign Ministers' Conference should be to determine whether Germany will continue to be governed under the control of the four powers, or whether it will be split into two countries politically or economically; if the Foreign Ministers' Conference fails, to prevent the deepening of the division of Europe, to adjust the relations between the powers, and to determine whether to grant Austria independence and sovereignty after the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty. The crux of the German problem lies in the Soviet Union's request to extract production from Western Germany as compensation, and the Soviet Union's request to co-manage the Ruhr. The crux of the Austrian problem lies in the German assets in Austria. Observers believe that it is not impossible for the powers to make concessions to each other regarding German assets in Austria, so it is expected that the London Conference will at least be able to sign the Austrian peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] Judging from the mood in the hours before the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin are still strongly opposed to the Soviet Union's demands regarding Germany's political economy and compensation. French Foreign Minister Bidault is in a difficult situation due to domestic unrest. The U.S. delegation suspects that the French Communist Party is deliberately making things difficult for him. The French delegation said that Bidault intends to align French policy with that of the United Kingdom and the United States and wait to see what initiative Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will take in order to achieve some practical results at this conference. The composition of the conference has therefore become a three-to-one situation, just like the Moscow Conference.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Express Concern About the Future of US-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[News From Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 25th, Broadcast: As the United Nations General Assembly is about to end, representatives from various countries are expressing pessimism about the future of US-Soviet relations as they pack their bags. Optimists are as rare as missionaries are easy to find in a gambling game. A few optimists are focusing their attention on the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, believing that Secretary of State Marshall will ignore the advice of Hoover and Burnes and strive to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union. The American people are expressing great concern about the future of the United States and the Soviet Union. Dr. Bowles, chairman of the American Medical Association, is deeply worried and suggests that every American city should immediately prepare for atomic bomb warfare and take steps to ensure that those injured by atomic bombs can receive medical treatment. Rabbi Wise, chairman of the World Jewish Congress, asked President Truman, Stalin, and Attlee to immediately hold a three-power conference and clearly declare that a third world war will never happen.</p>
<h3>German Reporters Interview at the London Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] There are about 100 news reporters, photographers, and radio broadcasters from all over the world interviewing at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, including German reporters, which is the first time since the war.</p>
<h3>Safety First on the German Question, France's Position Remains Unchanged, Ruhr Internationalization Separated From Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] At the London Conference, France may request political unification under the German federal system, and put forward four major conditions: Germany must be strictly monitored to ensure that it will never again be a threat to France. France must ensure that it receives a sufficient supply of coal from the Ruhr area to complete its reconstruction before Germany. The flexible agreement established by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States at the Moscow Conference this spring is far from meeting France's requirements. The Saar region, where important coal mines are located, must be incorporated into the French economic sphere. France has set up customs checkpoints along the Saar and German borders and replaced the old Saar mark with the French franc. The industrial center of Germany, the Ruhr region, and the west bank of the Rhine River must be separated from the German mainland, and the Ruhr region must be internationalized. The Rhine region should be occupied by Allied forces to guide its self-determination.</p>
<p>Bidault and his advisors have focused on the Ruhr issue, believing that this is Germany's arsenal, and France must use this as a guard post in order to obtain sufficient security. France advocates long-term monitoring of Germany and supports the 40-year disarmament plan proposed by the United States. France is prepared to oppose the Soviet Union's sudden proposal for a comprehensive and immediate withdrawal of occupying forces, believing that the presence of troops is, if not the only way to obtain Germany's peaceful promise, at least the most appropriate way.</p>
<h3>Austrian Foreign Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>Foreign Property in Austria Should Be Subject to Austrian Law</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber told reporters in London that the Austrian government is determined not to agree to a treaty that does not have the possibility of a peaceful resolution or that makes it impossible for Austria to exercise sovereignty over its own economy. After the Four-Power Committee on the Austrian Treaty set up by the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference met in Vienna, it was already familiar with the main points. There are four points in the Soviet Union's proposal that are contrary to the basic attitude of the Austrian government, namely: the Soviet Union receives German funds in Austria and does not simultaneously receive the debts and other obligations attached to German funds; the German assets received by the Soviet Union must not be nationalized by Austria in the future; the Austrian government must not prevent the transfer of German property interest to the Soviet Union; when disputes arise in the implementation of the agreement on German property, the Austrian government should negotiate directly with the relevant country. Gruber stated that the basic attitude of the Austrian government is that all foreign property in Austria should be subject to Austrian law.</p>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 24th] Austrian President Renner issued a declaration today urging the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty and the withdrawal of 100,000 occupying troops from the country. It is said that Austria neither hopes nor wants to become the focus of international relations.</p>
<h3>President Truman Reports to Congress on the Distribution of Relief Bill Funds, China Receives US$27.7 Million</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 24th] President Truman reported to Congress today that since Congress allocated US$332 million for the U.S. foreign relief plan on July 30 of this year, as of the end of October, the remaining funds in the budget were only US$24,766,886. Expenditures approved as of October, including costs, insurance, and freight, are listed as follows: Austria: US$88,639,146; China: US$27,700,000; Greece: US$38,731,747; Italy: US$121,296,678; Trieste: US$9,765,943; International Children's Emergency Fund: US$15 million; Voluntary Relief Association Transportation Fund: US$5 million; Administrative Expenses (State Department): US$600,000; Citizens Food Committee: US$500,000.</p>
<h3>Frequent Meetings Held by the French Cabinet to Discuss Countermeasures Against Labor Unrest; National Transportation Paralyzed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The Schumann cabinet is scheduled to hold a full cabinet meeting on the morning of the 26th to decide on economic and political policies to stem the nationwide labor unrest involving millions of workers. After reaching an agreement, the government will immediately meet with a delegation from the General Confederation of Labor, which had requested Premier Schumann for "the earliest possible meeting."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] A strike by over 1.2 million workers under Communist leadership has brought almost all French industry to a standstill. The newly occurring strike of transportation workers is virtually isolating France from the outside world. Partial strikes by telephone workers and others were already underway when the General Confederation of Labor ordered a complete strike. The railway workers' strike has forced trains to stop running, and ship traffic has been reduced to a minimum, as all ports are blockaded by the Communists. Coal mines and most important industries have come to a halt. Winter rains in Paris and elsewhere have deepened the mood of unrest and misery in France.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] The number of striking workers in France has reached one million today. Premier Schumann has decided to take strong measures to prevent the expansion of labor unrest while also preparing to make possible concessions to the workers' demands. However, the government has not yet announced how it will deal with the labor unrest. When asked if the government would take over the railways and other striking industries, the answer was that it was possible. Government sources also said that Premier Schumann might accept the workers' demands to increase the minimum wage from 7,000 francs per month to 10,800 francs, but only on the condition of an immediate return to work.

<h3>New Plan to Dissolve Japanese Zaibatsu; US Suddenly Requests Extension for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] According to official sources today, the United States has requested the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission to extend the discussion on the second phase of the plan to dissolve the Japanese zaibatsu.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Suffers Major Blow; Committee on Industry and Mining Overturns Coal Mining Bill; Government and Three Parties Accuse Liberal Party of Making Trouble Unreasonably</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Katayama Cabinet suffered its first blow on the afternoon of the 25th when its Coal Mining National Control Bill was overturned by the Committee on Industry and Mining before it was even submitted to the parliament for discussion. At the committee meeting this afternoon, only nine of the 29 members present voted in favor.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The three parties of the Japanese Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties, finding that the Diet had fallen into chaos due to the Liberal Party's disruption, sought to counterattack strongly. Last night, they issued an emergency statement, placing the responsibility for the current political turmoil entirely on the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>The statement stated in part: In the past two or three days, the Liberal Party has been unreasonably disruptive in the Diet, deliberately hindering the proceedings of the Diet, completely disregarding the spirit of a democratic Diet. The government and the three parties have made the greatest concessions and have made the greatest efforts. The coal mining nationalization bill was also put forward at the meeting on the 24th as a final compromise, but it was still rejected by the Liberal Party, and the Diet's proceedings were thus brought to a standstill. In this situation, the three parties are truly helpless and are making the facts public to the people.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House Avoids Meeting</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The plenary session of the House of Representatives opened at 7:55 PM on the 24th amidst a storm of roaring, with Vice Speaker Tanaka Man-itsu, from the Democratic Party, sitting in the Speaker's chair, and no sign of Speaker Matsuoka Komakichi, who had become a problematic figure. The Liberal Party had prepared to submit a motion of no confidence in the Speaker, while the Democratic Party wanted to submit a motion of confidence in the Speaker first. A fierce dispute broke out between the government party and the opposition party. As of 8:50 PM, no room for compromise had been found, and the meeting never got on track, presenting an unprecedented state of chaos since the Diet opened.</p>
<h3>Evidence of Matsui's Crimes is Conclusive</h3>
<p>Far East Tribunal Presents Evidence</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th, Special Dispatch] According to the evidence presented by the International Military Tribunal this afternoon, Matsui Iwane, accused of being responsible for the "Nanjing Massacre," authored several inflammatory essays in 1941, advocating for war against the United States before it was ready. It is said that Matsui, the former commander of the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Force, worked to prevent the success of the US-Japan negotiations in 1941. The court presented several essays showing that Matsui identified the United States, Britain, and several "democratic countries" as Japan's current enemies. Matsui also stated in his essays, "I absolutely oppose any compromise with the United States." He also called "attempting to resolve the war against China" an absurd mistake. In his July 1941 essay, Matsui stated that if the United States declared war on Germany in the short term, Japan should fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact and resolutely declare war. Matsui's essay also stated that the United States was "neither prepared nor capable of engaging in two-front warfare." The true intention of the United States was to "deceive Japan" and prolong negotiations so that it could gain time to prepare for war.</p>

<h3>Humorous Invalid Ballots: "Su Wu the Great Baboon" Unclear Whom It Alludes To</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In this professional association election ballot counting, as of yesterday, only the Certified Public Accountants Association had no invalid ballots among the ten associations that had been counted, the rest had more or less invalid ballots. However, unlike the regional election ballots, which were invalidated due to writing errors, most of them were invalidated due to elegance or teasing. For example, one ballot in the industrial and mining association wrote "Celebrate Invalid Ballot," one ballot in the labor union wrote "Great Baboon," and one ballot in the bar association even had the words "Su Wu." There is no such name among the candidates, and it is unknown what its intention is. Others added the words "I vote" for so-and-so "one vote" on the candidate's name and attached fingerprints, which was too solemn and backfired. In the education association, Zhang Yi's vote was invalidated because he wrote "Zhang Yousan" (Zhang Yi's pseudonym).</p>

<h3>Speculators Run Rampant; Decision to Arrest and Severely Punish; Juvenile Police on Duty; Hope for Assistance from the Restaurant Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Police Commissioner Yu Shuping met with reporters from various newspapers at 5:00 PM yesterday and made a statement, stating that the recent price fluctuations in the city were purely caused by speculators running rampant.

<h3>Repeated Impersonation of Soldiers to Rob Car Drivers; Two Criminals Captured Inside the Great World, Confessing to the Stolen Goods at First Sight; Admitting to a Total of Fourteen Cases</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the 12th of this month until the night before last, there have been more than ten continuous cases in this city of impersonating soldiers to deceive and rob outbound cars, and to loot drivers' belongings. The police authorities attach great importance to this and have issued special orders to the branch bureaus to investigate and crack down. After receiving the order, Shi, the director of the Lao Zha branch bureau, ordered section chief Jiang Shangpei to take action. On the one hand, he instructed the organization of a special search team, selecting capable officers Zhang Kuilian and Song Shaomei as leaders, to cooperate with all criminal police, volunteer police, and section chief Chen Jun'gan, etc., to form eight teams. Section chief Jiang summoned the victimized drivers from various car companies to the bureau to inquire in detail about the appearance, clothing, and any secret marks of the car-robbing bandits. At around 6 PM on the 19th, the search team, accompanied by the victims, began work and set out to various restaurants, dance halls, theaters, brothels, coffee shops, amusement parks, and other public places. A portion of the officers took cars to the Great Western Road, Victory Road, and the southern city, Zhabei, Jiangwan sister suburbs, searching any uniformed people encountered by hiring taxis.</p>
<p>Being Stubborn and Still Trying to Evade</p>
<p>At 10:30 PM the night before last, the search team went to the Great World's Da Jing Ban boxing arena. Two spectators were carefully identified by the victimized drivers as undoubtedly the fierce bandits who robbed cars. The police were then instructed to secretly monitor them. Before long, the bandits discovered this and went up to the second floor, intending to sneak out. At that time, officers Cui Zhiliang and others intercepted them. The two bandits refused to comply, saying, "We are soldiers. You police have no right to deal with us. Besides, we have not committed any crimes, so why are you stopping us from passing?" Their attitude was stubborn, and they attempted to resist with guns several times. Fortunately, the police officers were prepared, and they could not carry out their plan. They were then escorted to the accounting room downstairs. On the one hand, military police were summoned to the scene. The military police confiscated a left-handed gun and seven bullets from them, and also found a flashlight pen, handkerchief, American dollar coins, etc. They were then all taken to the Lao Zha branch bureau for strict interrogation. According to the confession, one was named Lu Wenbin, using the alias Jiang Quanrui, also known as Lu Yun, 26 years old, from Haimen, impersonating the captain of the 9th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Regiment Management District; the other was Jiang Xianfang, 21 years old, from Ningbo, using the alias Wu Hao, impersonating the platoon leader of the 1st Platoon of the 9th Company. They both flatly denied the car robbery cases.</p>
<p>Lowering Their Heads in Silence, Directly Admitting Without Denial</p>
<p>Later, the victim recognized that the "Jackct" (jacket) they were wearing had blue paint on the back, and that the flashlight pen, handkerchief, and other items they were carrying were all stolen goods. The two criminals then lowered their heads in silence and directly admitted without denial that they had committed fourteen car robbery cases since November: On the 8th at 9 PM, they robbed Quan Yugen, a driver from the Haida Car Company on Zhongzheng Middle Road, of his wristwatch, wool sweater, and 100,000 yuan in legal tender. On the 9th at 7 PM, they robbed Ren Changqi, a driver from the Xiang Sheng Car Company, of 40,000 yuan in legal tender and a wristwatch.

At 11:10 PM on the 13th, they robbed Ji Zengxiang, a driver from the Qinlai Car Company, of a black woolen short overcoat and wool sweater. At 10:20 PM on the 15th, they robbed Chuan Sheng, a driver from the Xiang Sheng Company, of a wool sweater, wristwatch, and 280,000 yuan in legal tender.

They robbed Shao Jinhai, a driver from the China United Benefit Car Company on Huashan Road, of 110,000 yuan in cash. At about 5:10 PM on the 14th, they robbed Shen A'san, a driver from the Xiang Sheng Company, of 640,000 yuan, a wristwatch, a wool sweater, a wool vest, etc. At 7:45 PM on the 17th, they robbed Wang Genbao, a driver from the Antai Neng Company on Wusheng Road, of a wristwatch. At 11:25 PM on the 23rd, they robbed Du Meichang, a driver from the Xiang Sheng Company, of one dollar and forty cents in American currency. As for all the guns, bullets, and symbols, they confessed to having stolen them from the division headquarters one after another. Since the case involves impersonating soldiers, after the interrogation is completed, the matter will be reported to the garrison headquarters for further investigation. Two bandits who specialize in robbing outbound cars have been arrested. On the right is Lu Wenbin, and on the left is Jiang Xianfang. (Photo by this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Request for Price Increase by Tram and Bus Companies Not Approved; Decision to Be Made After Reviewing Next Month's Income and Expenditure</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Following the price increases for tap water, gas, electricity, and telephone services, the appeal for price adjustments from the city's tram and bus companies is also very urgent. The Public Utilities Bureau has rejected the request because their current situation does not warrant a serious loss, and instructed them to maintain the original price for the time being, hoping to compensate for the increase in passengers. Since the last price increase, the number of passengers on public vehicles has decreased sharply. The Public Utilities Bureau will review its income and expenditure in the first ten days of next month before making a decision on adjusting prices. If there are indeed economic difficulties, the issue of raising prices may be considered in the latter part of next month. According to the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, who told reporters yesterday: The formula for the automatic adjustment plan for public utility prices approved by the Executive Yuan has not yet arrived in Shanghai. The bureau has urged it twice by telegram, and it is estimated that it will be delivered in early next month. The Public Utilities Bureau will convene relevant agencies to discuss how to use it in a fair and reasonable manner.</p>

<h3>Delegation to Request Tax Exemption Resumes Appeal to Capital</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Preparatory Committee of the National Grain Federation, regarding the previous petition for exemption from grain tax, have not yet received a clear order from the central government to approve the exemption. They have only heard that the Ministry of Finance believes that this tax is related to local finances and has ordered provinces and cities to decide whether to exempt it based on their own circumstances. The association believes that if this becomes a reality, the differences in exemptions in various regions will affect the lives of the entire population, and the purpose of the petition will not be fully achieved. Therefore, the association has reconvened representatives from various regions and will travel to the capital again tonight, led by Mr. Wang Xiaolai, to petition again.</p>

<h3>Case of Two Telecommunications Bureau Students Killed and Injured in Car Accident; Both Drivers Do Not Admit to Manslaughter</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Hua Yuyin and Peng Fulan, two students from the Telecommunications Training Class of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, were walking on Qiujiang Road at 6 PM on the 18th of last month when the drivers of the Shanghai North Third Section Fire Brigade, Xi Jinquan, and the Relief Headquarters, Wu Shaoxin, were driving a fire truck and a truck, respectively, and racing each other on Qiujiang Road.

<h3>Yijing's Murder Case; District Court Continued Hearing Yesterday; Gu Weijun Denies Ever Going to the Wang's House</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Line Police Gu Weijun of the Xujiahui Police Bureau, who was accused of shooting and killing resident Wang Wanshun on the evening of June 23 this year, was secretly continued yesterday morning in the Criminal Court One of the District Court by Judge Xie Zhiying. First, Gu Weijun was brought up, and his testimony was the same as last time. Then, Tang, a police officer from the Xujiahui Police Sub-bureau, testified: At 2 AM on the 24th, he was ordered by the sub-bureau chief to go to Wang Wanshun's house, the scene of the incident, to investigate, and Gu Weijun guided him. Three bullet casings were found outside Wang's house, and no bullet strikes were found inside the door. He then returned to the bureau to report and handed over the bullet casings to the judicial section chief. Plainclothes policeman Huang Yiquan testified: After suppressing the riots at the Hongkou Theater on the evening of the 23rd, he escorted 1,000 troublemakers back to the sub-bureau. The sub-bureau chief led the way in front, and we escorted them in the rear. When we arrived near Wujiazhai, a young man chased after us and shouted, "My father has been beaten to death!" The sub-bureau chief asked who had beaten him, and he pointed to Gu and said, "It was him!" The sub-bureau chief took Gu's gun and inspected it, and found that three bullets were missing. He then ordered me to go to Wang's house to investigate. I went to Wang's house with a plainclothes policeman surnamed Li and saw an old man lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing. I immediately called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Just as I was closing the car door, people all around were noisy, and a dozen people came up and surrounded me. I was beaten on both my legs and back and slipped into the sun. I pulled out my self-defense gun and fired three shots into the sky. The crowd dispersed slightly, and I took a rickshaw and fled. Seeing that there were still several people chasing behind me, I fired three more warning shots, then two more shots for emphasis. After returning to the bureau to report, I went to the hospital for treatment, and I don't know anything else. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stood up and said: A bullet head was found inside the door of Wang's house and has been submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office and transferred to the District Court for inclusion in the file, which is sufficient to prove that Gu and others had fired shots inside the door. Questioning Gu Weijun, he still denied ever entering Wang's house, saying that "they dragged me in." The defendant's lawyer also said that the bullet head was .32 caliber, while the guns used by the Xujiahui sub-bureau were all .38 caliber, indicating that it was not related to the case. Finally, after Xu, Wang Wanshun's wife, and his son, Zhenxiong, testified, the court ruled that the case be retried on another date, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Geese Fly Past Hengyang - Anti-Japanese War Memorial City - Dividing Line Between North and South</h3>
<p>(Hengyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 20th) There is a line in ancient Chinese poetry that says, "Geese fly past Hengyang." Anyone who has been to Hengyang can truly feel the meaning of this line. Hengyang is an ancient city in southern Hunan, historically regarded as the dividing line between North and South China. Geese are birds of the cold regions. In autumn, the northern geese migrate south in search of food, stopping at Hengyang. Therefore, a small hill at the South Gate of Hengyang is named "Geese Returning Peak." Although this explanation may not be entirely reliable, as the northern geese do not necessarily stop only at Hengyang during their southward migration, the climate here is indeed similar to that of South China. Hengyang has no autumn; people wear light clothing on three sunny days and cotton-padded clothing on three rainy days. People accustomed to the climate of the southeastern coastal provinces find the climate in Hengyang somewhat abnormal.</p>
<p>Emerging During the War</p>
<p>Hengyang was not well-known before the war. It gradually prospered after the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was opened to traffic. During the war, it became a crossroads for highways, and after the Hunan-Guangxi Railway was opened to military traffic, it was the terminus. As a result, commerce flourished, and it was temporarily known as "Wartime Hankou," becoming a haven for adventurers. The small city of Hengyang had a population of over 800,000, and the market expanded to areas more than ten miles outside the old Hengyang city area. It was not only the only major city in Hunan, but also the only major commercial center in the rear during the war. Hengyang's status during the war in the minds of the Chinese people was no less than that of Guilin, Kunming, and Chongqing.</p>
<p>Also Being Destroyed During the War</p>
<p>Hengyang became a place of sudden wealth during the war, but it was also destroyed during the war. During the Hunan-Guangxi campaign in the thirty-second year of the Republic, Hengyang staged a 48-day defense, suffering intense artillery bombardment. Its losses were greater than those of any other city during the war, completely destroyed, leaving virtually nothing. Of the soldiers who directly fought, the entire Tenth Army had few remaining. More than 3,000 civilian laborers were buried in the hail of bullets, and over 300,000 people were either brutally killed by the enemy or died indirectly due to war-related diseases. More than 45,000 houses were burned, over 180 factories of various sizes were destroyed, over 370,000 mu of farmland were left uncultivated, and over 800 billion yuan worth of property was lost. After the victory and repatriation, entering Hengyang felt like entering a wasteland. Now, more than two years after the restoration, Hengyang still appears fragmented and dilapidated, with broken walls and weeds everywhere.</p>
<p>A Cemetery of Over 10,000 Heads</p>
<p>Because of the 48-day defense, Hengyang wrote the most glorious page in the history of our anti-Japanese war, and was thus named "Anti-Japanese War Memorial City." The only memorial in this memorial city is the Tenth Army Martyrs' Cemetery next to the Hunan-Guangxi Railway Station. This cemetery is built on Zhangjia Mountain, which was an entire regimental position during the battle of Hengyang. From the regimental commander down to the lowest-ranking soldiers, only one regimental adjutant was injured and carried back to the city alive. Everyone else heroically sacrificed themselves there. After the enemy occupied Chongyang, the loyal remains of this entire regiment were hastily buried in the trenches on the spot. In the spring of this year, after the restoration, General Ge Xiancai, commander of the Tenth Division of the Reserve Tenth Army, sent personnel to Hengyang to collect the loyal bones from the surrounding areas and built a cemetery on Zhangjia Mountain.</p>
<p>Due to limited funds, the cemetery is simple. All that is buried are fragmented remains, with not a single complete skeleton. Counting by skulls, there are more than 12,000. Although the tomb is closed, there are air vents around it. Peeking inside through the air vents, the white bones are clearly visible. This cemetery of over 12,000 skulls has not been valued by the government or local authorities. When you go to pay your respects, the desolation of the barren mountain and the sunken-eyed, collapsed-nosed skulls will evoke a long sigh, or even tears of sorrow!</p>
<p>A Memorial City That Lives Up to Its Name</p>
<p>Apart from the cemetery on Zhangjia Mountain, there is no other memorial in the Anti-Japanese War Memorial City. People who have not been to the memorial city assume that it must have neat and clean roads and modern buildings, making it one of the best model cities in the interior. Before arriving in this memorial city, the reporter also thought so, but upon arriving in Hengyang, the memorial city appeared to be a dirty and chaotic place with excrement everywhere.</p>
<p>Hengyang suffered another famine after the restoration, so its recovery has been particularly slow. Although it has established a municipality and has a municipal government, the municipal administration has achieved nothing. The main streets are full of piles of bricks and mud, the ditches are open, the sewage is black and foul, and the roads paved with yellow mud are muddy in the rain and dusty on sunny days. On the major thoroughfares, broken-down trucks are often parked on both sides, turning the wide roads into narrow paths that can only accommodate one person. On some roads, rain gathers into pools, and rickshaws run on the sidewalks. Cars driving on the streets of Hengyang have the appearance of amphibious vehicles. The new buildings on the main streets are uneven, some extending to the roadside and others set back, like jagged teeth, indicating that the construction of this city is all free-for-all.</p>
<p>However, this memorial city lives up to its name. High, dilapidated walls are everywhere, and the piles of bricks and mud on the roads resemble barricades used during street fighting. These things that should have been cleared long ago have not been cleared, undoubtedly preserving these war relics like preserving ancient relics, so that the citizens do not forget the suffering of the Anti-Japanese War. At the same time, it tells those who come to this memorial city for the first time that this is a truly worthy Anti-Japanese War Memorial City.</p>
<p>Fighting and Laissez-faire</p>
<p>The people of Hunan are strong, especially in western Hunan. Hengyang is in southern Hunan, so fighting is particularly prevalent. Three words disagree, fight first and talk later. The local government of Hengyang has the spirit of Lao Tzu's "laissez-faire," and has never strictly investigated a case of "fighting." Therefore, everyone regards "fighting" as the only way to resolve all disputes. From spring to now, there have been no less than a hundred incidents of "fighting" here, some of which have resulted in deaths. In the most recent incident, Yang Dazhan, a physical education teacher at Fushu Middle School, was beaten to death for refereeing a soccer game. The municipal government has still not been able to arrest the murderer. People in Hengyang are accustomed to this and do not think the case is particularly serious, but the sports community in Changsha is very angry. The day before yesterday, when entertaining the Changsha press, they declared that they were prepared to go on a collective hunger strike to petition. If they failed to achieve their goal, they would form a suicide squad of one hundred people to come to Hengyang to arrest the murderer by force. If such a situation were to develop, Hengyang would have another lively "fighting" performance.</p>
<p>Hengyang Has a Future</p>
<p>Despite how disorderly Hengyang appears now, Hengyang still has a future. Hengyang is the hometown of the great Confucian scholar Wang Chuanshan of the late Ming Dynasty. It is a land of propriety and righteousness, and education is still developed. Although there are questionable aspects to the local customs, there are still some simple and ancient traditions here. As long as it is properly guided, it will be better than large metropolitan cities. As for the prosperity of the Hengyang market, the prospects are even more unlimited. Hengyang has a geographical advantage, with a highway network extending in all directions, and the Guangdong-Hankou and Hunan-Guangxi railways, two major arteries in the southwest. The Xiangjiang and Ganhe rivers also converge here. Agricultural products from all over southern Hunan are gathered and distributed in the Hengyang market. Hengyang has sufficient conditions for prosperity. Since the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Factory has decided to locate its branch factory in Dongyangdu, Hengyang, the population of Dongyangdu has increased, and the Hunan-Guangxi Railway is being rebuilt and will be open to military traffic next month. The route from the city center to the station is no longer as deserted as it was a month ago. The citizens' vision of a prosperous New Hengyang is gradually turning from anticipation into reality. Some people compare Hengyang to the Chicago of the East in the future. This is not empty talk. It is indeed possible. Let's take a look in a few years! (Special Correspondent Huang Chao-ru) Scenic Spots of Wuyi</p>
<p>The picture above shows the scenery of Wuyi Mountain, located on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. The main peak is in Chong'an County, northwestern Fujian. Legend has it that the immortal Wuyi lived here, hence the name. The mountain range spans over a hundred li, with thirty-six peaks and seventy-two rocks. The famous "Wuyi Tea" has a clear and fragrant taste, and is popular both at home and abroad. Because the mountain is densely populated with fir trees, it is also known as the Fir Ridge Range.

<h3>Fuzhou "Flying Thief" - Numerous Cases Accumulated Over Three Years of Theft</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou on the 22nd) Theft cases have been occurring frequently in Fuzhou City in recent months, but have not been solved. The former Municipal Operations Bureau received a tip that a habitual thief named Zhang Jinhuo, from Linsen County, was skilled at climbing walls and moving quickly like a swallow. He did not engage in honest work, but lived as a "gentleman on the roof," and was likely related to the various theft cases in Fuzhou City. After receiving the information, the police station also received intelligence that the thief would be committing a theft in Hongtang Township, Linsen County within a few days. The police station immediately dispatched several undercover detectives to lie in wait. The thief was indeed active in the township the day before yesterday and was captured by the detectives. Unexpectedly, the thief was physically strong and kicked one of the detectives, knocking him down. Fortunately, the other detectives stepped forward to surround him and capture him. They put him on a ferry to cross the Minjiang River at Hongshan Bridge. The thief jumped into the water again and fled. The detectives also jumped into the water to pursue him. After fighting in the water for half an hour, they finally recaptured him and took him to the bureau. According to his confession, he has committed countless thefts in the urban area of Fuzhou and various towns in Linsen County over the past three years. Most of the theft cases in Fuzhou City in recent months were all committed by him. The stolen goods will be recovered according to his confession in the next few days.</p>

After returning to Zhenjiang, Wang urgently telegraphed the central government to request a large amount of emergency relief to help the disaster victims and inspire the people's morale in order to win back their hearts.</p>
<h3>Shenxi Shipping Joint Venture Salvages Sunken Ship in Huangdu</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 24th) The shipping of goods in the Shenxi area relies heavily on water transportation in addition to land transportation. However, a large Sichuan-style boat weighing over a hundred tons, loaded with white mud from Wuxi to Shanghai, accidentally hit a bridge pier while passing through the Huangdu Bridge on the evening of the 23rd and sank completely, blocking the bridge opening.

<h3>Food Control in Jinshan</h3>

The county government has forwarded the order for compliance. Also, it is reported that the collection of land tax in kind in the county has already begun.

<h3>Talking about "Strikes" from a Professor's Perspective</h3>
<p>— Binbin</p>
<p>Recently, school "strikes" have almost become a "routine," a "daily occurrence." One wave subsides, and another rises. Before a few classes can be held, an entire semester is wasted. Some are in response to unfortunate events elsewhere (such as the suicide of a student surnamed Yu in Hangzhou), some are to resolve internal issues (such as the demands for "reinstatement" of two colleges in Beiping and Tangshan), some are for political reasons, and some are for international reasons. Those directly involved and the public opinion circles mostly focus on the relationship between students and the education authorities, or between young people and the government, while neglecting the perspective of the "professors." Therefore, Lao Bin will discuss it based on his personal experience.</p>
<p>Three parties agree and form the three elements of a school. The word "ke" (課, class) implies that schools are places for lecturing. Attending class, finishing class, lecturing, and studying are the closest activities between professors and students, and they are the basic conditions for every school to be a school. However, whenever "strikes" are mentioned, we only hear about the authorities being busy and the students being busy, while the professors are ambivalent and seem to be irrelevant. It was not until the spring and summer of this year when the student union and the professors of the Beiping Normal University and Beiyang Pingmin College had different opinions on the school's reorganization that the professors' meeting separately expressed their respective actions. The professors' meeting of Beiyang Pingmin College even proposed that all major school matters related to the overall situation should be decided by the agreement of three parties, namely: 1. the school's administrative authorities; 2. the professors' meeting; 3. the student union. The reason is that the three parties constitute the "three elements" of the school. Since the actions of the student union are not limited to "autonomy," the responsibilities of the professors' meeting should also not be limited to routine events such as curriculum and lectures. This is one point. Professors are hired to teaching positions, which is different from the purely administrative system of staff. They have their own positions with respect to the students and the authorities. This is the second point. In the past, professors did not have special organizations, but now that there is a "professors' meeting," it certainly has meaning, with the same concern for the overall situation as the student union.</p>
<p>The above is theoretically accurate and irrefutable. In fact, it is also indispensable. Please allow me to explain why:</p>
<p>This is a matter of fact, not law or theory. Normal classes, suspensions, and holidays are handled by the school's administrative department in accordance with the rules, and professors and students comply with them. Today's special suspensions (strikes) and classes (resumptions) are controlled by the student union. As long as they make a resolution, the classrooms will be empty, the school authorities cannot force it, and the professors have no classes to teach, so they have no choice but to strike. This is entirely a matter of fact.</p>
<p>"Strikes" have purposes, but the purposes of the student union and the professors' meeting may not be the same. If the student union believes that the purpose has been achieved and resolves to resume classes, then the authority of the professors' meeting has room to be expressed.</p>
<p>If students "strike" and there are professors but no students in the classroom, then the professors have no choice but to strike. This is understandable. If students "resume classes" but the professors "strike," leaving students but no professors in the classroom, then how can the students resume classes? This is not a hypothetical situation. In the past six months, this has already happened at a certain university in Beiping. When professors do not agree with the strike but have no choice but to strike, they say, "Okay, you decide on the strike, I decide on the resumption. We'll talk when you resolve to resume classes." This is what is meant by "any party has a way to block the road," and it is what is meant by "responding to fact with fact."</p>
<p>The above is factual and rational. The conclusion is that the "professors' meeting" should have the same expression on major school matters as the "student union." This is beneficial to the school's administrative authorities, and it is not without benefit to the student union. It has the effect of adjusting and controlling rampant strikes, and it has the wonderful effect of jointly cooperating and increasing teaching efficiency for legitimate and meaningful strikes.

<p>Enthusiastic Participation in Badminton League</p>
<p>Registration for the Second Badminton League has been extended to 5:00 PM on the 28th. Domestic teams that have participated include Yucai B Team and Xiaoguang Middle School. The Foreigners' Sports Federation will have two or three teams participating. Other teams such as the American Public School, the Western Overseas Youth Association, and other groups have a large number of teams. The A Team of China will be the strongest domestic team in the A Group this season. The champion of the B Group last season, Maicai, must be promoted to the A Group, but the list has not yet been submitted. St. John's University has a strong lineup and will also participate in the A Group. Therefore, this year's league will definitely be more lively than last year's. The league is divided into four types: men's B, mixed men and women, and women's group. The men's B group uses a single round-robin system, and the men's A group, women's group, and mixed men and women's group all use a double round-robin system. Each match consists of three doubles matches (must indicate which group of doubles). Each doubles match is played in three games, and the first to score fifteen points wins. (This league does not use the "wide release" tie-breaking score). Each team must have at least two groups participating in each match, otherwise it will be considered a forfeit. Each game won is worth one point, and the team with the most points is judged to win or lose. The team with the most points is the winner of the group's championship.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Victory Shield Football Tournament: China United Wins First Battle Against Military United</h3>
<p>China United's Forward Line is Sharp, Winning 3-2</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The Hong Kong Chinese Football Association is holding the Victory Shield to commemorate the victory of the Great War. It was decided that the Abandoned United and Military United will participate in the championship. The competition will be scored on a point system, with two points for each win. If a team wins one and draws one in two matches, they can retain the Victory Shield for one year. Taking advantage of the auspicious occasion of the British Princess's wedding (November 20), the first battle for the Victory Shield began. As a result, China United won at Causeway Bay, leading 3-1 in the first half. Military United scored one goal in the second half, losing by one goal.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the season, foreign soldiers have never been able to stretch their arms due to the poor lineup. Military County has repeatedly deployed troops. They are always strong in defense and weak in attack. In addition, this year's Chinese team has a wealth of talent, so Military United's loss was expected.</p>
<p>In this battle, Military United got their starting forward, Ziviro, back, and the offensive was very sharp. The attack was more active than before, which is the best performance of the foreign hillbillies this year. The reason for the defeat is that although both sides have equal defensive strength, China United has a better forward line.</p>
<p>The goalkeepers on both sides performed well, so there were not many goals conceded. The order of goals: Military United's Ziviro first shot into the post and bounced in, 1-0. China United's Zhu Yongqiang scored two goals, and Guo Yingqi scored one goal. This is the record of the first half. In the second half, in the last minute, Military United's Kiaon took advantage of Yu Qien's fall to save the ball and shot again, ending the game 3-2. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>China United Team</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong (Oriental) Liu Songsheng (Kitchee) He Yingfen (Kitchee) Yu Qien (China) Kong Qingyu (China) Li Zhaorong (Kitchee) Zhu Yongqiang (Oriental)</p>

<h3>Purchasing Imported Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange: Details of the Review are Being Negotiated; "Simplicity" and "Speed" are the Principles for Purchasing Procedures</h3>
<p>(Our Report) After the establishment of the Review Committee for Handling Imported Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange by the China Trust Bureau, it was decided to handle imported goods with self-provided foreign exchange without permits prudently according to the two major principles of speed and simplicity. It is reported that the relevant associations such as import and export merchants in this city will, within one week, classify and evaluate the goods arriving at the port as soon as possible and submit detailed lists to the subcommittee of the Review Committee to provide opinions. After the subcommittee reviews them, if there are no problems, it can draft detailed review rules and submit them to the Review Committee's regular meeting for approval and implementation. If the procedures are handled smoothly, the detailed review rules can be reviewed and implemented within three weeks. After a meeting of sixteen units of import and export merchants and other associations in this city some days ago, representatives were appointed yesterday to report to the relevant authorities of the Import and Export Management Committee. Agreement has been reached on the following points: 1. The original regulations stipulated that imported goods with self-provided foreign exchange without permits that are not willing to apply for purchase should be re-exported within 60 days after the "Measures for Handling Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange" are announced. It is now changed to re-exporting within 60 days after the detailed review rules for goods with self-provided foreign exchange are announced. 2. Goods that have been registered for re-export after the promulgation of the handling measures can also be flexibly handled if they wish to cancel the registration for re-export. 3. If the cargo owner is a wholesaler and needs to re-wholesale to retail customers or small wholesalers in other places, and cannot provide the documents of direct users one by one, it is permissible for the local chamber of commerce or relevant trade association to provide the documents, and after verification, it will also be approved for priority purchase. The Import and Export Management Committee has also agreed to consider this.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks See New Highs, Sudden Rebound Before Closing</p>
<p>Chinese stocks fluctuated greatly yesterday. Although the margin issue held the power of life and death, the stimulus of financial commodities arose again. After being weak, they became popular. Zhongtu Yongsha set new highs of 429 yuan and 432 yuan midway, but weakened before closing.</p>
<p>At the opening in the morning, due to reports that there was no sign of reducing the margin, Yongsha opened low to 402 yuan, and then fell to low prices of 394 yuan and 397 yuan. Exchange rates hung high, and buyers were eager, pushing the price up to an immediate delivery price of 423 yuan and a deferred delivery price of 424 yuan. Therefore, those who closed out at high prices and those who maintained at low prices struggled with each other. The off-market interest rate opened high to 22.5 cents and 2.7 cents, and the money market tightened, repeatedly retreating to within 410 yuan. The closing price at noon was 416 yuan and 420 yuan.

<h3>Xu Baiyuan Flies to Hong Kong and Transfers to Guangzhou to Inspect Financial Affairs in South China</h3>
<p>Xu Baituan, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Four Allied Banks, in order to inspect the financial situation in South China and attend the economic construction conference convened by the Xingyuan, took a Civil Aviation flight to Hong Kong and transferred to Guangzhou on the morning of the 25th, accompanied by Mr. Zhu Shengquan, a commissioner of the Four Allied Banks, and his entourage. Since Song Ziwen took charge of Guangdong, he has seen that the financial resources in Guangdong and Guangxi are extremely abundant, but due to the situation, they have not been properly utilized, and the industry has declined instead, and foreign goods have flooded in. In order to cooperate with the national policy and develop the economy of South China, a specific construction plan is being prepared, and the construction of the Huangpu Port is one part of the plan. The implementation of this plan depends on the cooperation of finance. Therefore, the Executive Yuan designated Mr. Xu to go to Guangzhou. Before his departure, Mr. Xu told reporters: This trip may take a week. How to coordinate the financial aspects with the economic construction of South China in the future will depend on contact with all parties and research of relevant information before a specific plan can be determined based on the facts.</p>
<h3>Economic Authorities Announce Measures to Prevent Coal Hoarding; Factories are Limited to Two Months' Worth of Coal</h3>
<p>The economic authorities of this city, in view of the fact that the cold winter has arrived and coal is very important, and due to the hoarding and manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the market price has fluctuated greatly. Now, in order to prevent the hoarding and manipulation of coal in Shanghai and affect people's lives, a measure has been formulated and announced for implementation. All coal storage in this city, including bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and coke, shall be handled in accordance with the measures for cracking down on hoarding of daily necessities in extraordinary times, and shall also be handled in accordance with these measures. The amount of coal stored by factories is limited to two months' consumption. The amount of coal stored by coal merchants is limited to one month's business volume. However, those who purchase in large quantities from non-controlled mining areas may report to the Fuel Management Committee for approval to increase the amount of storage. The amount of coal stored in coal yards is limited to one month for depositors. If the time limit is exceeded and the excess amount is more than 100 tons, approval must be obtained. Except for coal merchants, coal yards, and those who really need coal, no one shall store coal. If anyone violates these measures and stores coal, or stores more than the limited amount, or fails to clear it out, the Fuel Committee will purchase it at the allocated price. For all coal purchased for violating these measures, 30% of the purchase price shall be deducted and used as a bonus for the investigators. If it is discovered due to a secret report, the bonus shall be divided equally between the secret informant and the handling personnel. These measures have been approved by the Shanghai Economic Inspection Committee and will be implemented from today. They will also be reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for filing by the Fuel Management Committee.</p>
<h3>Spirited Sentiment and Strong Buying Interest: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Rise in Unison; 20-count Coarse Yarn Jumps 2,800,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions saw strong interest from Tianjin merchants due to favorable reports from Tianjin. Merchants from Guangdong and Wuhan followed suit, further fueled by rising cloth prices. Market sentiment was high, and industry players were eager to buy. Sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, leading to a surge in the market. In particular, 20-count "Celestial Maiden Brand" yarn was highly sought after by merchants, with its price jumping 2,800,000 yuan from the previous day to 32,500,000 yuan. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn reached a high of 48,500,000 yuan, a rise of 2,500,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also continued to rise by 1,200,000 to 2,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened this morning with tight credit and the impending sale of Peng Textile products, resulting in ample high-grade cloth on the market. Overnight gains were quickly relinquished, and prices initially declined. However, in the afternoon, merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, and news of a rising US dollar exchange rate and soaring cotton yarn prices boosted market sentiment. Asking prices rose again. By the end of the day, 12-pound "Dragon Head" and other fine cloths rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Biji (coarse cotton cloth) and Shanggong (tribute cloth) were in high demand, rebounding by 20,000 to 40,000 yuan. Other cloths also showed firm footing.</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Becomes Popular</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market saw a relatively stable opening with strong supply and demand. In the afternoon, as cotton yarn prices surged, spinning mills increased their buying interest, and industry players rushed to replenish their stocks. The market turned firm, with asking prices rising by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan. Overall trading was active, with 1,800 bales changing hands. Prices for delivery to factories opened with Ling Shi at 5,250,000 to 5,456,000 yuan, De Zi cotton at 5,620,000 yuan, Shashi cotton at 5,373,000 yuan, 1/16 Midland cotton at 6,283,000 yuan, and Sanyu Town cotton at 4,877,000 yuan, with 1,100 bales traded.

<h3>Rayon First Firm, Then Weak; Mill-Made Silk Goods Continue to Hold Firm</h3>

<p>The market rose in the early session and continued to hold firm in the later session. Final asking prices for all grades were 40,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The morning transaction price for high-grade lots was 80,000,000 to 80,050,000 yuan, with afternoon transactions ranging from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 yuan. This was due to depleted stocks and the fact that many Wuxi silk mills were suspending operations due to a lack of raw materials, which greatly boosted market confidence.</p>
<p>Silk Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for silk quilt covers and "Dazhan" (big battle) and "Biqiang" (strong pen) goods opened around 9,200,000 yuan, briefly falling below 9,000,000 yuan. However, as various parties took advantage of the low prices to buy, the market rebounded to 9,500,000 yuan, similar to the closing price of the previous afternoon. In the afternoon, rising raw material prices further boosted market sentiment, and the market eventually reached a new high of 30,080,000 yuan. However, other goods saw limited actual demand, and although they rose in unison due to cost factors, the gains were relatively moderate.</p>
<h3>Textile Adjustment Committee Orders Relevant Institutions to Prepare for Implementation of Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee, following orders from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to implement the "Provisional Measures for Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution" soon, decided to issue an order today to the six regional cotton spinning guilds, nine replication industry guilds, and the China Peng Textile Company. The six regional cotton spinning guilds are required to prepare all relevant matters within ten days and submit a report. According to the "Provisional Measures for Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution," all cotton yarn produced by private spinning mills in the Shanghai region under the jurisdiction of the guilds, except for the cotton yarn submitted to the government for commissioned spinning, for export, and for the actual needs of self-weaving, will be handed over to the guilds' self-organized institutions for distribution. In addition to the measures, detailed yarn distribution methods can be formulated and reported to the Textile Adjustment Committee for approval. The nine replication industry guilds, including the Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry, Handmade Cotton Weaving Industry, Underwear Industry, Towel and Blanket Industry, Canvas Industry, Ribbon Industry, Handkerchief Industry, Camel Wool Industry, and the Fourth District Knitting Industry, are required to determine the minimum monthly cotton yarn allocation for each factory based on the equipment and yarn demand of their members within seven days and submit a distribution list to facilitate implementation. The contents of the order are as follows: "We have received from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs a copy of the "Provisional Measures for Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution," ordering immediate implementation. We should comply. In addition to a telegram, we are enclosing the original measures. Please investigate and prepare for relevant matters promptly and diligently. A report on the completion of preparations must be submitted within ten days (six regional guilds) or seven days (nine replication industry guilds) to facilitate the commencement of implementation."</p>
<p>The Six Regional Cotton Spinning Guilds are scheduled to hold a routine meeting of executive directors today.

The question of whether to convene a general membership meeting will also be raised for discussion at today's meeting.</p>
<h3>Import of Jute, Ramie, and Gold Thread Approved; Exchange Settlement Amounts Announced by Export Control Commission</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Export Control Commission announced yesterday that it has approved foreign exchange for the import of jute, ramie, and gold thread for several traders. After importing these raw materials, they can often be processed into finished products for export in eight months. The Export Control Commission stated that each portion of foreign exchange approved can recoup more than five times the amount in foreign exchange. The following merchants and amounts, having completed guarantees from designated banks, have been fully approved: For importers of gold thread, fourteen companies including Kunhe Huahang, Chifeng Huahang, Huitai Import and Export, Zhongfei Import and Export, Jianye Xingji Huahang, Yingmeng Huahang, Wanxiang Trading Company, Yichang Huahang, Ruihe Hang, Guo Xianji Trading Company, Fulong Huahang, Wanchun Import and Export, Dongchun Hang, and Hua Fu Trading Company have been approved to import 38,500 kilograms of gold thread, requiring a total of US$166,025 in foreign exchange. For importers of ramie, thirteen companies including Zhongfei Import and Export, Yu Ji Huahang, Zhanfeng Huahang, Jianye Yu Ji Huahang, Yingfeng Yehang, Kunhe Huahang, Wanxiang Trading Company, Maoli Huahang, Fulong Huahang, Wanchun Import and Export, Dongchun Hang, Ruihe Hang, and Huizhai Import and Export have been approved to import 845 bales of Soviet ramie, requiring a total of US$63,481 in foreign exchange.

<p>Foreign Exchange Earned from Exports to Be Sold to Designated Banks</p>
<p>[Our Report] In order to promote exports and earn foreign exchange, the Export Promotion Department of the Export and Import Control Commission previously approved a special project to pilot the import of raw materials for straw hats and embroidery. It was stipulated that exporters applying to import these raw materials must have their designated banks guarantee that all imported raw materials must be used to produce finished products for export. Based on current domestic and international market prices of raw materials and finished products, the foreign exchange earned from the export of finished products is estimated to be greater than five times the foreign exchange required for the import of raw materials. According to current regulations, the foreign exchange earned from the sale of finished products must be sold to designated banks. Reports that manufacturers applying to import raw materials are required to have banks guarantee that four-fifths of the foreign exchange earned from the finished products made from these raw materials will be settled with national banks are inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Aluminum Plant to Commence Operations Next Month</h3>
<p>The annual import quota for aluminum ingots is set at 5,000 tons. The current selling price is approximately US$350 per ton, requiring a total of US$1.75 million in foreign exchange. The Taiwan Aluminum Plant under the Resources Commission will commence operations in mid-December. Aluminum ore, the raw material for aluminum ingots, will be purchased from Southeast Asia. The plant estimates that it will need US$390,000 in foreign exchange to purchase the aluminum ore required to manufacture 5,000 tons of aluminum, which would save over a million US dollars in foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Declining Supply of Pig Lead; Tin Foil Industry Petitions for Allocation</h3>
<p>Since the tin foil industry in this city resumed operations in May of this year, the composition and quality of finished products have been continuously improved, making them comparable to imported products. However, among the various main raw materials for tin foil, the most severe shortage is pig lead. The supply of foreign lead produced in Canada and Mexico, as well as domestic lead from provinces such as North China and Yunnan, is decreasing, and black market prices are soaring. Compared to January of this year, prices have increased more than sixfold, compared to April they have increased fourfold, and compared to August they have increased two and a half times. Moreover, domestic transportation is not yet smooth, and the quantity of domestic lead transported from areas such as North Hebei and South Sichuan is gradually decreasing. The future supply of pig lead is a major concern. Therefore, the industry has petitioned the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office for a monthly allocation of pig lead raw materials required for the monthly production of 20,000 "jiao" of tin foil.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Investigates Reasons for Returned Checks</h3>
<p>Most Due to Insufficient Funds</p>
<p>In order to investigate the reasons for returned checks, the Ministry of Finance dispatched personnel on the 24th to conduct spot checks on five banks and firms with relatively good credit. The investigation revealed that the main reason for returned checks was insufficient funds. The Ministry of Finance is now paying attention to this issue and is drafting measures to deal with returned checks due to insufficient funds, vowing to impose strict sanctions.</p>
<p>According to information from the Audit Department of the National Bank, the Ministry of Finance has revised the measures regarding the inability to use checks on the same day and will implement them immediately upon receiving the order.</p>
<p>Commercial Briefs</p>

<p>The market for agricultural flue-cured tobacco was high, but then fell slightly. In the afternoon, buyers were active, and many high-priced transactions were made. As a result, 10-pack Great Britain cigarettes reached a high of 24.7 million yuan, a sharp increase of 1.4 million yuan from the previous day. "Old Knife" cigarettes also rose by 650,000 yuan. Other cigarettes also rebounded by 500 to 6,700 yuan, and packaged cigarettes also rose by 13,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The prices of daily necessities such as soap and Gu Ben brands have all rebounded by 10,000 to 33,000 yuan. "Beautiful" and "Phoenix" brand matches rose by 70,000 to 100,000 yuan. The market for fire and Western candles is also brisk.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>This Year's Hit Playwright on Broadway: Anderson</h3>
<p>— United States Information Service</p>
<p>In mid-July of this year, Hollywood began filming the screenplay for "Joan of Lorraine." At the same time, another play by Maxwell Anderson will be staged on Broadway, potentially setting a record for audiences appreciating his work. Anderson's play, written for characters with historical interest and poetic sentiment, is the most significant theatrical achievement of the 1946-47 New York theatrical season. This is not only because Ingrid Bergman portrays the character of Joan of Arc with brilliance, but also because the play itself provides Anderson with a tool to raise questions that many have felt for years: What can a person believe in?</p>
<p>Anderson's answer is a belief in personal conscience, which opposes the blind worship of power prevalent in the 20th century.</p>
<p>"Joan of Lorraine" proves that theater does not necessarily have to be entertainment or amusement; it can also be used to explore philosophical and religious issues, while still being successful. Anderson argues that all of his plays should be examples of his idea of how the stage should be used. If he has something to say, a question to raise, then the play should be his tool for expressing it.</p>
<p>Anderson was born on December 15, 1888, in Atlantic City, Pennsylvania. In his early years, his family moved repeatedly, from Pennsylvania to Ohio and Iowa in the west, and finally settled in North Dakota, where he studied locally.</p>
<p>He rejected his father's suggestion that he dedicate himself to the ministry. He loved writing from an early age. While studying at the University of North Dakota, he worked as a gatekeeper and attendant at a newspaper office in Grand Forks to support himself. In 1911, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree and then took on a teaching position. He spoke frankly, and when he discussed pacifism with his students, he immediately had arguments with them, because at that time, the issue was not yet popular.</p>
<p>After leaving North Dakota, Anderson went to the West and became a lecturer at Stanford University, where he taught English and pursued advanced studies as a research student. He obtained a doctorate from Stanford University in 1914 and took over as a professor at Whittier College in Southern California.</p>
<p>His outspokenness again led to disagreements with his superiors, so he returned to North Dakota to work in journalism, briefly serving as the editor of the Grand Forks "Herald." Soon after, he went west to San Francisco to work as a columnist for the "Chronicle." However, his frank remarks again caused trouble, and he was finally advised to find another job. For the next six years, he worked in New York, first at the New Republic, then at the New York Globe and Commercial Advertiser and the New York World.</p>
<p>In May 1923, after seeing "Six Characters in Search of an Author," he became a playwright himself. He wrote the play "White Desert." The play was highly praised by critics, but it was not considered a success by the general public.</p>
<p>Later, Anderson met Laurence Stallings and co-wrote one of his more successful plays, "What Price Glory," which premiered in New York on September 3, 1924. He then wrote several plays, but none were very successful until his play "Saturday's Children" premiered in New York in January 1927, receiving great acclaim.</p>
<p>The following years were a prolific period for Anderson, with famous works such as "Both Your Houses" and "High Tor."</p>
<p>As the crisis of war became increasingly serious, Anderson tried to write his ideas against the fascist way of life into plays. He wrote "Key Largo" based on the story of an American youth who joined the Spanish Republican Army, and then "Candle in the Wind" based on the Nazi regime in occupied France, neither of which was a great success. It was not until 1942 that he wrote a masterpiece, which was the first good American play about the US military during wartime. The play was titled "The Eve of St. Mark," and the story was quite simple, about a rural boy who enlisted in the army, with a line saying, "In order to make this a place for free men, we must be the first to fight, the first to sacrifice." Recently, the play "Joan of Lorraine" has made him a leading playwright once again.</p>

<p>"Yishan Miscellany" is not included in the New Tang paintings. Chen Zhensun of the Song dynasty said in "Annotations on the Book Records of Zhi Zhai" that it was written by Li Yishan Shangyin. Among them, there is a section called "Eyesore," which says: "Shouting commands under pine trees, shedding tears while looking at flowers, laying mats on moss, cutting down supporting willows, drying trousers under flowers, carrying heavy loads while enjoying spring, tying horses to stone bamboos, holding torches under the moon, a general walking on foot, building houses against mountains, referring to vegetables in orchards, raising chickens and ducks under flower trellises." Lu Xun said, "Although they are all common sayings and vulgar matters, they deeply penetrate the hidden aspects of worldly affairs."</p>
<h3>Feeling Inspired by Visiting the Chrysanthemums at Fuxing Park Again</h3>
<p>— Jin Gong</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>Visiting chrysanthemums on Fuxing Road, leisurely entering this garden, the yellow flowers competing in brilliance, one no longer hears the cries of monkeys (the monkeys in the zoo have long disappeared). The five colors are allowed to compete, a sound seems to want to speak; the old man frequently drags his cane, daring to take a leisurely pace without fear of trouble.</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>The sound surrounds the edge, people travel through the midst in a continuous stream; although the many flowers are viewed, only a few children are seen; after looking back, they are suddenly in front, walking west and turning east again; I know it is not a feast for the eyes, but I still shout endless joy.</p>
<p>Part Three</p>
<p>It is said that in the secluded clusters, new red and yellow embellishments are seen; people come to evaluate the faces of the chrysanthemums, the chrysanthemums laugh at the people looking at the flowers; Tao Yuanming has a noble integrity, fearing to bend his waist equal to his height; walking together, I carry my clever palm (the name of my young daughter), children are naturally innocent.</p>
<h3>Starting with Water Margin – Discussing the Evolution of Literature</h3>
<p>— Yu Ying</p>
<p>The predecessor of Water Margin was "Events of the Xuanhe Era" and similar vernacular tales. The author was not just one or two people, and the stories of the 108 heroes also seemed to have various versions with no definitive lineage. Due to centuries of evolution, it became "Water Margin." It is similar to Homer's epics, where the sources of the characters and stories are all found in folk tales. After being transmitted and written by the masses, the characters and stories will inevitably be added to or deleted, but the more additions and deletions, the more brilliant they become. Gorky said in "The Diminution of Personality":</p>
<p>"Othello, Hamlet... all these archetypes were created before Shakespeare. The Spanish people sang 'Life is a Dream' before Calderón wrote it, and the Moors were before the Spanish. The knight of virtue was mocked in folk tales before Cervantes' 'Don Quixote.' And with the same sarcasm, the same poignancy; Milton and Dryden, Mickiewicz, Goethe, and Schiller, when they received inspiration from the unfathomable source of folk poetry, when they gained the wisdom of collective creation, they soared to the highest realm."</p>
<p>No typical image can be shaped out of thin air by one or two poets. Ah Q lives in Weizhuang and also lives in the hearts of the Chinese masses. The heroes, thugs, officials, and rascals in "Water Margin" were also vivid before the eyes of the common people, engraved and depicted by the nameless writers and singers of that time, becoming more and more archetypal and prominent through evolution. This is why the "powerful source" gave birth to this group of archetypal characters, which is what Gorky said: gaining the wisdom of collective creation. The writing skills of the author of "Water Margin," the author of "Don Quixote," and the author of "Othello" also soared to the "highest realm."</p>
<p>"The end in itself" is the slogan of art-for-art's-sake advocates. What is the purpose of literature? Everyone has already said it during the "rectification of names." Positively, it is to make human life better; negatively, it can target destroyers and attack those who hinder the normal development of social life. Literature is one of the branches of art, and the effect of art is to help create new human beings and help overcome what binds the growth of new human beings. I think the most important mission of writers is to expand life experiences, search for folk tales and legends, and promote and evolve them - this is extremely necessary.</p>
<p>The objects depicted by literature often undergo a qualitative change due to social changes. The objects of temple literature are the trivial matters of emperors, and the objects of academic literature are the abstruse discussions of one or two ancient philosophers. From ancient times to the present, the evolution to the current focus on the lives of people as the object of literary description has indeed gone through many twists and turns. Even with the same character, the peasants in the hands of poets in the old era were slaves of nature, and the archetype was mostly a wretched, troubled, and battered character. Today, the peasants under the pen of poets have already taken on a different appearance.</p>
<p>As for past literature, whether classical, romantic, or naturalist, the road was always trod out by our ancestors, and in fact, the steps were indeed from scattered and slow to strong and striving. New themes are increasingly being discovered in human life, and new writers also have newer writing skills and life experiences. They come from the people, and they are also familiar with the people, so they are more likely to accept the literary themes of the people. Lafargue thought that making the old themes deteriorate was the victory of realism, and once said: "The amazement at the people, the intoxication with the power and talent of the people, has replaced the previous obedience to nature and passive expectations, which mostly expressed a lack of confidence in humanity and a pessimistic attitude towards social progress."</p>
<p>These are all extremely objective statements. We can understand that in the hands of the Ming people, the ending of Water Margin was "pacifying the four bandits," and the heroes were transformed into bureaucrats; once in the hands of hack writers, the ending became what was recorded in "Crushing the Bandits," and the heroes were all killed. —The themes and techniques, consciousness and content of literature all evolve with the evolution of the times.</p>
<p>Rural Chapter</p>
<h3>Faintly</h3>
<p>— Lu Ting</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, the roadside pavilion at the foot of the small mountain was complete and intact: a small pavilion with a relatively high earthen wall facing west at the pavilion entrance. In summer, weary travelers would sit on the stone benches along the earthen wall to rest, the setting sun would not shine on their bodies; the wind, however, could gently brush over them. In winter, sitting in the pavilion, an old woman would bake sweet potatoes to satisfy the hunger of passersby, and the bonfire would also warm the hearts of every traveler.</p>
<p>Today, with years of continuous disasters and endless man-made calamities, not only has the screen wall of the roadside pavilion long collapsed, but every corner of the pavilion also leaks. In summer, there is wild grass and stagnant water inside... In winter, a houseful of cold wind blows through... Apart from a wild bird "cawing" and startlingly flying out from inside, travelers no longer stop there to rest...</p>
<p>Ah, the roadside pavilion has lost its coolness and warmth, so it becomes lonely in the desolate land.</p>
<h3>Idle Waterwheel</h3>
<p>— Poem by Chen Chi, Woodcut by Bai Shao</p>
<p>The waterwheel is idle,</p>
<p>Dozing off.</p>
<p>The fields, like stiff corpses,</p>
<p>Are wretched beyond words.</p>
<p>The thatch on the roof is disheveled,</p>
<p>Whipped by the irrational wild wind.</p>
<p>The village sobs silently...</p>
<p>The kind waterwheel,</p>
<p>For years, laboring without reward,</p>
<p>Trembling,</p>
<p>Carefully holding the river water.</p>
<p>(Farmers see it as sweet as nectar...</p>
<p>One scoop,</p>
<p>One scoop.</p>
<p>Not even enough time to see the faces clearly,</p>
<p>Just hurriedly</p>
<p>Passing it on to the fields.</p>
<p>The waterwheel</p>
<p>Never complains of its bitter fate.</p>
<p>To quench the thirst of others,</p>
<p>The waterwheel doesn't mind hard work...</p>
<p>The waterwheel, today,</p>
<p>Our friend who has shared our hardships for so many years,</p>
<p>Is bored with idleness.</p>
<p>Since the third watch of the night when officials arrest people,</p>
<p>It has been for a long, long time,</p>
<p>Having lost the treading of its relative-like toes.</p>
<p>The waterwheel's lips</p>
<p>Are parched and dry,</p>
<p>Like a wet nurse who has no milk</p>
<p>Watching the child who needs milk.</p>
<p>The waterwheel is so sad,</p>
<p>It can't even cry out a tear.</p>
<p>The waterwheel</p>
<p>Is painfully silent.</p>
<p>Who has taken away</p>
<p>Its hoarse melody?</p>
<p>The waterwheel, like the village,</p>
<p>Is having a very long dream...</p>
<p>In these years of war and chaos,</p>
<p>One can't afford to walk with lanterns,</p>
<p>One can't rely on the old days.</p>
<p>And our farmers,</p>
<p>With a bundle and umbrella on their shoulders,</p>
<p>Go to the city to seek refuge with distant relatives.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth wear a mourning face.</p>
<p>The village whispers endless desolation.</p>
<p>The waterwheel, like an abandoned orphan,</p>
<p>Under the eaves of the thatched house,</p>
<p>Guards the suffering of the countryside...</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Everyone must have a strong physique. Prevention is the fundamental plan.</p>
<p>Jin Baoshan</p>
<p>As society evolves, there are more opportunities for human health to be robbed. In fact, most diseases can be prevented. Modern medicine's most important aspect is preventive medicine, with the goal of enabling all of us to enjoy the richest life and achieve true health.</p>
<p>Li Tingan</p>
<p>Seeking medical treatment when one is already sick is a last resort. The pain of medicine and surgery, as well as the loss of time and money, are secondary to the fact that disease is always our danger and threat. It is better to prepare for rain than to dig a well when thirsty!</p>
<p>Liu Ruiheng</p>
<p>"Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals must advance toward a public health system, so that everyone can enjoy medical care. This must be promoted." Considering the current society, simply popularizing health checkups can lead to early treatment, avoiding economic and health bankruptcy. This is an urgent task.</p>
<p>Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Speaking at the National Shanghai Medical College, he said: "The day when health checkups and disease insurance are popularized in our country will be the starting point for the success of the new medicine, and also the turning point for national health and revival." Eradicating the shame of being the "sick man of Asia" and clearing potential disease sources is all in this one effort. Early detection can shorten the treatment time from three to five years to only five or six months. How much time and money would it take to treat a severe patient? Therefore, the benefits of health checkups are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Hu Dingan</p>
<p>The short lifespan and high disease rate of the Chinese people, as well as the alarming infant mortality rate, make raising health standards an urgent requirement of the times. I hope the press will help promote the "important significance of health," and that the people will also fight for their health rights.</p>

<h3>The Door to Health</h3>
<p>Wilkie</p>
<p>The author of "One World" says: "Health is more important than everything."</p>
<p>Shen Bao</p>
<p>Editorial on the Development of the 26th Anti-Tuberculosis Movement: "The Hongqiao Sanatorium and the Health Bureau, with the assistance of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, are conducting X-ray tuberculosis screenings. Through scientific identification, diseases are prevented before they occur, and the effectiveness of treatment is increased. Tuberculosis infection is more dangerous for young people. Everyone knows to cherish their lives. Based on concrete evidence, we can promote public awareness of prevention and ensure public safety."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu</p>
<p>Modern education prioritizes health. Check physical condition and correct shortcomings.</p>
<p>Zhang Wei</p>
<p>Speaking at the press reception: "Regarding the health of employees, in order to ensure the health of reporters, health checkups must be conducted once a year to detect any diseases." This is the only way to guarantee health.</p>
<p>Wu Shaoqing</p>
<p>In countries with developed health education, everyone has a health checkup once a year. In China, this is not yet common, so diseases cannot be detected in their latent stages. If all hidden minor illnesses are identified,</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai</p>
<p>American public health is improving, and general health is improving. I gained eight pounds in thirty-six days in America.</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun</p>
<p>Improving the health of workers is an important condition for revitalizing industry.</p>
<p>Gu Qianlin</p>
<p>Emergency loans for illness to help the poor are a good and kind idea, deeply admirable. However, the prevalence of chronic diseases in society and their tragic consequences are a hundred times greater than acute diseases. Spending a small amount of money to achieve a supreme effect is to implement timely health checkups. Then any deadly diseases can be eliminated early.</p>
<h3>The Art of Healthy Longevity—Why Should We Die in Vain?</h3>
<p>— Written by Laverin Lader of the United States</p>
<p>We should always check the cars we use to prevent damage. But why do we only pay attention to our own bodies after we are sick, and only then seek medical help? Isn't it too late!</p>
<p>A certain gentleman never got sick and usually exercised. However, he suddenly fainted in the office and passed away a week later, at the young age of less than fifty. Such a death is truly not worth it! All chronic diseases grow slowly and insidiously, and patients are often unaware. However, according to medical statistics, if physical examinations are performed every year, early detection and timely treatment can prevent death. The vast majority of deaths are unnecessary sacrifices. We may think that we are very healthy, walking briskly, and have no signs of illness. However, most deadly diseases do not give any warning beforehand. By the time they are discovered, it is too late! Dr. John of the Life Extension Research Institute reported that among a thousand businessmen who thought they were healthy and were buying cars or real estate, only one hundred and fourteen were truly healthy. Sixteen of them had diseases that were already quite serious. Because most people do not pay attention to real deadly diseases, they unknowingly kill many people without realizing it.</p>
<p>For the sake of our health and to avoid unnecessary deaths, why not have a physical examination once a year? There is no loss in time or energy, and the benefits are endless. The value of examination lies in preventing disease and detecting latent conditions. Many deadly diseases are easily cured if detected early. There are many examples. The cost of examination is also not high. Why not spend a small amount of money to gain health and longevity? In this era of scientific prosperity, it would be unjust to die in vain!</p>
<p>According to medical statistics, countless patients die each year from cancer or tuberculosis. If they could only remember one thing early on, they would surely be able to live several more years. What is this thing? It is neither a miraculously effective new drug nor a mysterious medical technique, but merely an annual physical examination.</p>
<h3>When to Conduct Examinations</h3>
<p>— Qin Tingyu</p>
<p>All formal physicians should instruct patients to undergo health checkups to thoroughly understand the cause of their illness and shorten the treatment time.</p>
<p>Before seeking medical treatment, all patients should first go to various hospitals or pathological testing laboratories to obtain a detailed report and present it to the physician. This will ensure accurate medication and double the effectiveness, leading to early recovery and stable production.</p>
<p>Before marriage, a health checkup should be conducted to ensure that both parties understand their health status. This is not only of great importance for eugenics in the second generation but also directly avoids various tragic consequences in the future. This step should not be neglected.</p>
<p>Anyone who suffers from a persistent cough or cold, weight loss, or general fatigue without knowing the cause, or who has hemoptysis, or after an acute infectious disease, should undergo a full body examination to prevent the latency of the disease.</p>
<p>Healthy people should undergo a full body examination every year. People in large cities are easily infected with diseases. The onset of disease is often not noticed, especially by young people. Like water mines in the sea, they must be cleaned frequently. Once they explode, it is too late to regret.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Ding Huikang's view, anyone suffering from a chronic disease that does not improve after three weeks should immediately undergo a full body health examination to avoid delaying their own condition and losing the golden opportunity for treatment. This is the turning point for turning weakness into strength. Therefore, doctors should provide proper guidance, and patients must thoroughly understand that one point of prevention is better than ten points of treatment. As the saying goes, it is better to prepare for rain than to dig a well when thirsty. "The body is the summation of personal capital." Safeguarding health and developing a career are of paramount importance.</p>
<h3>30% of American Youths Fail Military Enlistment</h3>
<p>In 1945, President Truman proposed the Economic Bill of Rights to Congress. These rights should be vested in every American citizen: the right to receive appropriate medical care and enjoy health, and the right to be fully protected from disease. On April 1, 1945, approximately five million registrants between the ages of eighteen and thirty-seven were given physical examinations, and approximately 30% were deemed unfit for military service. The youths who were rejected for enlistment were not unable to work, but their diseases and defects could hinder or reduce work efficiency or shorten their lifespan. Therefore, methods should be sought to prevent and treat the diseases or defects of every young person as early as possible. Although modern medicine is rapidly developing and science is advancing rapidly, countless people still die each year from preventable diseases, which is more than the casualties in the entire war. We must firmly recognize that the health of the people is a national undertaking, and that how to prevent the spread of diseases and how to promote the physical health of the people are the only ways to achieve the same victory through the recognition and acquisition of such possibilities.</p>
<h3>Legislative Member Wu Wentian Suddenly Suffers Stroke and Dies</h3>
<p>(Shen Bao News) Legislative Member Wu Wentian had just returned to Suzhou from Shanghai on the 10th and went to rest at the Industry Bank. During dinner, he was still chatting with friends. However, after dinner, he suddenly suffered a stroke and became unconscious. He was treated by a doctor, but there was no hope of recovery. He passed away at 11:30, at the young age of only forty-four.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Wu devoted himself to the central government, if he had undergone a health checkup and taken early precautions, he would not have suddenly met this misfortune.</p>
<h3>Popularizing Health Checkups for the Service of Readers</h3>
<p>"Being without illness is a blessing in life; only when sick do we know health is a fairy." However, how can we ensure the health of the public? There is only one way: to popularize health checkups. The examinations at our hospital ensure that the public obtains an accurate and detailed report in the shortest possible time, not only understanding their individual health status but also eliminating the danger of latent diseases and obtaining the opportunity for early treatment, thereby ushering society into a healthy domain. In terms of fees, those who hold the examination certificate of this newspaper will only be charged 300,000 yuan, which is only one-tenth of the pre-war fee of 50 yuan. Our hospital aims to serve society, promote prevention, eradicate infection, and gather the rewards of science to seek happiness for the public. We sincerely hope that all parties will assist in completing this mission. (Checkups are available every day in the morning and afternoon, and regular checkups are available on Sunday mornings.)</p>
<h3>City Council Suggests National Assembly Guarantee People's Health</h3>
<p>City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Ji sent a telegram to the Nanjing National Assembly, suggesting that people's health be guaranteed. The general idea is that the strength or weakness of the people's bodies is related to the rise and fall of the nation. In the past century, domestic strife and foreign aggression have prevented politics from getting on track, and the national physique has become increasingly frail, and morale has declined. It is extremely shameful to be called the "sick man of Asia"! The people's lack of attention to hygiene has a profound impact on the survival of the nation. The crux of the problem is that the people are complacent and self-destructive. The state should urgently formulate a comprehensive and concrete policy, and guarantee that the people can enjoy all kinds of measures derived from science. This would be a model for modern democratic countries to seek welfare for the people. It is specifically recommended that the National Assembly add a clause in the constitution to guarantee the people's health, so as to strengthen the nation.</p>
<p>The strength or weakness of the people's bodies is related to the rise and fall of the nation.</p>
<p>Promoting hygiene and physical fitness depends on advocacy.</p>
<h3>Premarital Health Checkups—The Health Bureau is Thinking of the Next Generation of Young Citizens...</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of required physical examinations before marriage, Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei said that this measure is absolutely necessary. Zhang said: "In order to simplify procedures and facilitate citizens' checkups, we do not intend to designate hospitals. Any doctor registered and qualified by the Health Bureau can handle the matter and issue a certificate. This examination does not mean that marriage will be prohibited if the results are not satisfactory. If there are shortcomings, they can of course be corrected. Otherwise, the harm will be passed on to later generations. This is extremely important to the country and the nation! In short, this matter is worth promoting. To strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the race. A marriage physical examination is a prerequisite for strengthening the race."</p>
<h3>"Talents Unfulfilled"—Forever Makes Heroes' Sleeves Wet with Tears</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The late Dr. Yu Fengbin was a father's friend. He served as the president of the China Medical Association and the vice president of the Physicians' Association. He was familiar with public health and wrote books. Unfortunately, he passed away at the young age of forty-six. Dr. Niu Huisheng served as the president of the Orthopedic Hospital of Zhongshan Hospital and the president of the Chinese Medical Association. He devoted himself to medical affairs and spared no effort, but he passed away before the age of fifty. Dr. Jiang Fengzhi returned to China after World War I and founded Tongde Medical College. His students were all over the country, but he only lived to the age of forty-four. Alas! These three gentlemen are pioneers of our party. When I was a student, I admired the Physician's Code of Ethics compiled by Mr. Yu, which stated, "Formal physicians should promote medical knowledge and popularize public health." Mr. Yan Fqing said that Mr. Niu regretted that he could not devote more effort to public health when he was ill. I, a humble student, wrote it on my belt to remind myself and deeply sighed that the three gentlemen's talents were unfulfilled, which makes people have the feeling of "before the army could set out, the general died; forever, it makes heroes' sleeves wet with tears". Liang Rengong once said: the country is like a salt mountain, if the quality of salt changes, the mountain is still there, but it is just its name, and the country is in danger! Looking at the deterioration of our country's medicine, the decline of the nation, and the decline of national power in the past twenty years, it is almost directly proportional. Mr. Ren Gong's words are indeed not false. The people are the foundation of the country, and health is the driving force of the foundation. A foundation without power is just the name of the people, but there is no country. I am worried for the people of the country! The three gentlemen worked hard for medical affairs, were familiar with public health, and sought the happiness of patients day and night. Their ambitions and deeds were so great, but they neglected their personal health, which led to their inability to live long lives and fulfill their ambitions. What a pity! I think that if they could have undergone health checkups early in their busy lives, prevented things in advance, and eliminated the source of the disease, they could have lived a long life, and their contribution to society would have been unlimited. This is not only a loss to our medical community but also a loss to the country. Since the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people's livelihood has been difficult, and medical problems have become more and more serious. After visiting the United States again, I feel that improving national health is really urgent. If we want to achieve stability, we must start with individuals, from individuals to society, from families to the country. Like building a giant mansion, after the cornerstone is laid, we can build up layer by layer. The so-called "to strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the race, and to strengthen the people, we must start with our own health" means that everyone must strictly implement early examinations, obtain accurate diagnoses, and prevent problems before they occur, so as to achieve the goals of guaranteeing health, saving medical expenses, and stabilizing society. Health checkups are so important! All my countrymen should not treat these words lightly! If we promote it and implement universal examinations, we will eliminate latent disease sources and wash away the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia".</p>

<h3>Ballad of the Soldier Poet</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouwu</p>
<p>Before discussing "Soldier Poetry," we must understand that the term "soldier" is not limited to certain people—now that conscription is practiced, everyone has the obligation to be a soldier—in ancient times, from the emperor to the common people, as long as they had experienced battles and worn armor on the battlefield, those "from the ranks" could be called "soldiers." From this classification method, I can assert that the founding father of "Soldier Poetry" should be Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty, Liu Bang. His representative work, "The great wind rises, the clouds fly, my might extends over the land, returning to my hometown, how can I get brave warriors to guard the four quarters?" (Ode to the Great Wind), is quite sufficient to stand alone for thousands of years. Although Xiang Yu's "My strength plucked up the hills, my might overshadowed the world, but the time is against me, and the horse does not fare forth, and since the horse does not fare forth, what is to be done? O Yu, what is to be done?" appeared before Liu Bang's "Ode to the Great Wind," it ultimately suffered from its depiction of a hero's final days and his tender feelings, causing it to become melancholic and lingering, which had already lost the original face of "Soldier Poetry." Thus, in selecting the master of the "Soldier Poetry" altar, we have to abandon Xiang and return to Liu, and endure the pain of reluctantly parting.</p>
<p>As for the poetry of Li Ling and Su Wu, and the verses of the Cao family, father and sons, which followed, there are countless capable poets who are also refined and handsome generals. They are all tempered and polished hundreds of times, and their meter and structure are strict, which is very different from the style of "Soldier Poetry," so they are not discussed. From the Han and Tang Dynasties down, browsing through hundreds of schools, Song Taizu—Zhao Kuangyin—is unique. When he was unknown, he once composed a poem "Sun," saying, "Wanting to come out but not coming out, the light flickers, thousands of mountains and ten thousand mountains burn like fire. In a moment, it rushes to the sky, chasing away the remnant stars and chasing the bright moon." The tone of a rough fellow, the heroic chant of a soldier, is truly a superior work in "Soldier Poetry." As for Emperor Ming Taizu Zhu Yuanzhang's poem "Chrysanthemum," "When a hundred flowers bloom, I do not bloom; when I bloom, they are all frightened. I want to fight a battle with the west wind, and my whole body is clad in golden armor." Its imposing manner is arrogant and has the sound of "drumming and striking gold." Even if Li and Du were reborn, they could not say a word about it. This is why "Soldier Poetry" is unique for thousands of years.</p>
<p>As for the Qing Dynasty's unofficial history, it is recorded that during the Yongzheng period, a certain Manchu was a great general. Once, he was released to the two Jiangs, and his comrades in Beijing held a banquet to see him off. During the banquet, the hosts presented parting works, which inspired the general, who picked up a pen and wrote a poem: "I, the old man, ride a horse down to Jiangnan, the young men of Jiangnan laugh and welcome me. Knowing that I am the old man, add a horizontal stroke to make Heaven!" The meaning is to boast that he is below one person and above ten thousand people. However, the paper is full of fishy smell and vulgarity, which flows into the demonic path of "Soldier Poetry"!</p>
<h3>Looking at the Imperial Court</h3>
<p>— John</p>
<p>A few emperors under the age of ten.</p>
<p>In the past, emperors were the highest leaders of the country. The people's sufferings and the nation's safety were all in the hands of one person. This kind of position is not easy to assume unless they have extraordinary abilities. However, when we examine Chinese history, there were emperors who ascended the throne as children. It is simply an absurd joke to have yellow-haired kids who are still wet behind the ears become emperors who rule the entire country. Now, let's bring out the emperors from the Han Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty who were under the age of ten, so that everyone can have a laugh.</p>
<p>Emperor Zhao of the Western Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of eight, reigned for thirteen years, and died at the age of twenty-two.</p>
<p>Emperor Ping of the Western Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of nine, reigned for five years, and was poisoned by Wang Mang.</p>
<p>Emperor He of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of ten, reigned for seventeen years, and died at the age of twenty-seven.</p>
<p>Emperor Shang of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at one hundred days old, and only lived to be two years old.</p>
<p>Emperor Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of two, and only lived to be one or two years old.</p>
<p>Emperor Zhi of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of eight, reigned for one year, and was poisoned by Liang Ji.</p>
<p>Emperor Xian of the Eastern Han Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of nine and later abdicated to the Wei Dynasty (not voluntarily).</p>
<p>King Qi of Wei, ascended the throne at the age of nine and was later deposed by Sima Shi.</p>
<p>King Kuaiji of Wu, ascended the throne at the age of nine and committed suicide at the age of sixteen.</p>
<p>Emperor Cheng of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of five, reigned for seventeen years, and died at the age of twenty-two.</p>
<p>Emperor Mu of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of two, reigned for seventeen years, and died at the age of nineteen.</p>
<p>Emperor Shun of the Five Dynasties Song Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of seven, reigned for three years, and died at the age of ten.</p>
<p>Emperor Gaozong of the Northern Wei Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of two, reigned for fourteen years, and died at the age of sixteen.</p>
<p>Emperor Gaozu of the Northern Wei Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of four, and died at the age of thirty-two.</p>
<p>Emperor Xuanwu of the Northern Wei Dynasty, ascended the throne at the age of five, and died at the age of nineteen.</p>
<p>Emperor Jing of Zhou, ascended the throne at the age of eight and died at the age of nine.</p>

<h3>Talking about White Fungus in Winter</h3>
<p>— Xiutang</p>
<p>Autumn passes and winter comes. On the advertisement column of the newspaper, advertisements for soliciting white fungus customers occupy a prominent position again. White fungus belongs to the Auriculariales family of Basidiomycetes and parasitizes on the decaying parts of moist-leaved trees. After the rain in spring and autumn, fruiting bodies occur, the larger ones being two or three inches in size, shaped like human ears.</p>
<p>The trees parasitized by white fungus are mostly Qinglei trees. Between winter and summer, mountain peddlers rent mountains, cut down trees, and remove all branches and leaves. Then, the trunks are cut into sections, each about two feet long. Then, they are erected in order in a place where the soil is fertile but not humid. By the fifth and sixth months of the lunar calendar, after the cultivation of the environment and climate, wood ears grow on the tree bark. At this time, the wood ears can be picked, removing the dregs and broken ones, and cutting off the tree bark. After washing and re-selection, pure wood ears are obtained. Then, they are dried with fire. Generally, high-quality goods (those produced in summer) weigh only one or two taels after drying per catty. Autumn goods weigh four catties, and only one or two taels are obtained after drying. Chen Shan goods (i.e., those produced last year) weigh eight catties, and only one or two taels are obtained after drying. This is why white fungus is expensive.</p>
<p>Those who are fond of white fungus mostly season it with sugar. According to doctors, the effects of seasoning with rock sugar or with white sugar are different. Eating it with rock sugar can nourish the lungs, dissolve the intestines, dissolve hair, and eating it with white sugar can treat red and white dysentery, female yin deficiency, and various gynecological diseases. Therefore, wealthy families use eating white fungus as a tonic in winter. However, according to the analysis of chemists, the nutrients in white fungus are not high. The results of the analysis are as follows:</p>
<p>Carbohydrates 68.01%</p>
<p>Fat 3.12%</p>
<p>Protein 6.51%</p>
<p>Ash 5.51%</p>
<p>Calcium 0.643%</p>
<p>Phosphorus 0.250%</p>
<p>Iron 0.0304%</p>
<p>The protein content of white fungus is very low, and it obviously has no value in providing protein. Although the carbohydrate content is high, there is absolutely no possibility of lacking this nutrient in food. Therefore, we do not need to use expensive white fungus to provide this easily available carbohydrate. The inorganic salts contained in white fungus can be said to be very abundant, the most abundant being calcium, followed by phosphorus and iron. However, it is too uneconomical to use this expensive food to provide this source of minerals.</p>
<h3>Embroidery Belt Tunes - Two Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>In Fuzhou, the custom of abandoning infants is rampant. A few days ago, wild dogs were discovered eating live infants. I still remember that at the beginning of this year, a similar tragedy occurred in Nanjing. Considering the large number of abandoned infants across the country, often reported in newspapers, it's hard to guarantee they won't be eaten by dogs. People either don't see it, or even if they do, no one reports it. If the unknown number could be tallied, it would be shocking. It truly makes one feel, "What kind of world is this?" Therefore, I fill these lyrics as a lament—</p>
<p>Remember in Nanjing, wild dogs eating abandoned infants. Unexpectedly, in Fuzhou city, the dogs are equally fierce! Should small lives be so lightly, heartlessly sacrificed? What era is this? One's own flesh and blood, devoid of love and filled with cruelty!</p>
<p>It's not just Fuzhou city, abandoned infants are everywhere. Reports are often continuously published, the numbers difficult to clarify! Wild dogs, with hungry teeth, contend, how terrifying, a heartrending cry! Born in a decadent world, beasts that eat humans, roam freely in broad daylight!</p>
<h3>Inside and Outside the "Prison"</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that prisons are established for those who have committed crimes.</p>
<p>For a person to go from the free world into the narrow prison gates is, of course, a misfortune, a disaster, a tragedy. A person who has never been in prison cannot experience the vastness of the world outside the prison; only those who have been in prison can understand the hardships of prison life.</p>
<p>Whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad, "prisons" are ultimately no different.</p>
<p>Gu Dazhang of the late Ming Dynasty recorded his prison life, saying, "Once entering the imperial prison, all sounds and information are distant and cannot be seen face to face, which is as good as death." He Yu Zhang said, "In the imperial prison, writing a note to request food and drink from outside is like the manifestation of ancestors; family members delivering food is like descendants offering sacrifices." Thus, he finally sighed with emotion: "How can one make such a depiction if not confined to prison for a long time?"</p>
<p>The great English writer Oscar Wilde spent two years in prison for male homosexual acts, which led him to a painful curse of prisons. He said, "The prisons of humanity, each is built of bricks of shame, and surrounded by fences for fear that Christ might see how people mistreat their brothers." He also said, "The organization of prisons is absolutely and completely wrong."</p>
<p>Yet, the reality is precisely this: "Where there is sorrow, there is holiness." When people are thrown from the free world into the "unfree" prison, they naturally feel the greatest pain, but pain is not necessarily an enlightenment. People rely on it to recognize things they had not recognized before.</p>
<p>Gu Dazhang was framed and imprisoned for offending the eunuch Wei Zhongxian over a boat, and in the end, he could not avoid being harmed by Wei's clique. However, his integrity grew stronger with each setback, and he did not beg for mercy or surrender to Wei.</p>
<p>After Wilde was released from prison, he himself admitted that it was the second turning point in his life. He devoted all his energy to writing his last masterpiece, "The Ballad of Reading Gaol." People universally recognize that this work was produced after he encountered the miserable and cruel reality of life in prison for two years. It is filled with humanitarian sentiment and is even compared to Dante's Inferno and praised as "the most beautiful poem written in English."</p>
<p>Naturally, no one in the world would use these facts to encourage others to go to prison; otherwise, only a madman would do so. Moreover, throughout history, no one has voluntarily thrown themselves into prison to "enjoy" the suffering of that hell on earth. However, the reality is so terrifying today. According to a report in Shanghai, a young man in dire straits in Shanghai, known as the Paris of the East, actually went to the court and insisted on being imprisoned when he had no way out. This is not only frightening but also inevitably evokes a sense of "What kind of world is this!"</p>
<h3>The Five Great Dangers of Mankind</h3>
<p>— Chai Fei</p>
<p>Dr. Shapley, the director of the Harvard University Observatory, recently declared that human culture is suffering from the threat of powerful physics and weak sociology, fleeing in despair with almost nowhere to hide. With a humorous tone, Dr. Shapley further pointed out the five major dangers of mankind: "Geniuses who want to control the present and the future, guiding the world towards destruction; narcotics that extinguish desire or reproductive ability; having leisure and feeling bored; super-weapons that provoke new wars due to infighting; and epidemics spreading around the world."</p>
<p>Dr. Shapley believes that to overcome the five major dangers of mankind, a global universal education plan should be established under the guidance of the UNESCO, and it should be actively implemented with strong support. Shapley said: If we have no way to do this, the only way to save ourselves from the control of geniuses is to kill infants who are born with genius traits cleanly.</p>
<h3>Miss America</h3>
<h3>Miss America's Birthday</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Because a woman's youth is especially precious, she attaches particular importance to her birthday. American material civilization surpasses any other country, and Miss America is especially unwilling to let go of celebrating her birthday. She does not send out invitations in advance but verbally informs acquaintances when she encounters them, generally saying, "Such and such date is my birthday, please come to my house to play." If they are more familiar, they will ask: "What do you plan to give me?" Sometimes she is honest and not shy, specifying that you give her a powder compact or an expensive pen, or even a watch or a silver fox coat, depending on the relationship. Gifts of watches and silver fox coats are limited to those with intimate relationships, such as spouses, lovers, etc. Ordinary friends giving a (Birthday Card) is considered to have fulfilled their obligations. Giving generous gifts is very rare; giving cards is the majority. She pastes the cards in a photo album or scrapbook, as a meaningful souvenir. Parents give their daughters gemstone birthday rings, leather coats, pianos, or even cars for their birthdays, especially their seventeenth or twentieth birthdays. Don't think that giving pianos and cars is something amazing. Pianos are only worth two or three hundred US dollars. A 1947 model car costs about one thousand six or seven hundred US dollars.</p>
<p>On the day of the birthday, a specific birthday cake is prepared. If someone sends one, you don't need to prepare it yourself. Many birthday candles are inserted on the cake. Many relatives, classmates, and neighbors are invited to have a party, to eat (Cocktail) (Yangjingbang English experts translate as "chicken tail wine"). According to custom, all the guests stand around the birthday cake, holding plates. Miss America blows out all the candles in one breath, and then everyone shares the birthday cake. After the cake is eaten, either dinner is served, or only refreshments are provided. The party is held for dancing. Each guest must dance with the birthday girl once to show that they have arrived with a gift. Often, her feet become sore from dancing, and it is common for several pairs of silk stockings to be torn.</p>
<p>Misses from middle-class families can receive many gifts for their birthdays. Would you say they violate the principle of thrift? That would be nitpicking. Because the gifts are all practical items and are not wasted. Americans never send flower-patterned silver shields, nor do they rely on servants, so there is no expenditure on tips. I believe that propriety in the virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame is very important. Giving gifts should of course be included in propriety; otherwise, greeting with bows and hand gestures would make that kind of propriety become hypocrisy, and hypocrisy is shamelessness. Austerity movements should be limited to practical gifts, and not overthrowing the etiquette. If we don't forget the past, even the chairman's birthday will see people casting golden statues. Isn't this "propriety"? However, the government should sanction unscrupulous merchants who raise the prices of goods, but don't just talk and do nothing; otherwise, please remain silent. (10)(6)</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<p>Shen Bao, in partnership with Renhe Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Baoli Hospital, and Shangxian Relief Society Hospital, co-organizes assisted childbirth for poor women.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinhua Feng bears half the cost single-handedly, his enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<p>This newspaper, in partnership with Renhe, the First Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian, Baoli and other four hospitals, is conducting a "Poor Women Assisted Childbirth" movement. All expenses are borne equally by the cooperating hospitals and this newspaper. In other words, the medical expenses for each parturient woman are borne half by the hospital authorities and half by this newspaper. With the needs of society, the "Poor Women Assisted Childbirth" movement is expanding day by day, and the number of hospitals cooperating with us has increased from one, "Renhe," to four. But at the same time, we are also facing an urgent problem - the funding problem. The assisted childbirth funds of this newspaper have always been donated by enthusiastic readers. However, due to the changes in currency value and the continuous rise in medical equipment prices, we are constantly worried about the inability to balance the budget. Fortunately, Mr. Jinhua Feng gave us warm encouragement and support when we felt difficulties. He generously agreed to donate the assisted childbirth expenses that this newspaper should bear each month. The assisted childbirth expenses handled by the "Renhe" and "Shangxian" hospitals in October were 12,587,500 yuan. This museum should pay half of the amount, totaling 6,293,750 yuan. This amount has been paid in full by Mr. Jin, and the relevant officials have received it from the two hospitals. As for Baoli and the First Red Cross Hospital...</p>
<p>We believe that in this society, the number of people who sponsor the "Poor Women Assisted Childbirth" movement is definitely not limited to Mr. Jin. We respectfully and sincerely hope for the encouragement and donations of enthusiastic people so that countless poor parturient women and infants can receive safe protection.</p>
