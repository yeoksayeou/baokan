<p>（一）平衡財政穩定幣値：幣値是否穩定與銀行業之關係，最為重大，惟有穩定之幣制，方能使人民有儲蓋之心理，我銀行乃能發揮其集中運用社會資金之功能，然欲求穩定幣値，必先停止通貨膨脹，欲停止通貨膨脹，必當平衡財政始，願與政府及全國同胞協力促其實現。</p>
<p>（二）改進金融機構確定銀行體系：工商業金融系統與農業金融系統，必須確立，在工商業金融系統中，尤望積極加强中央銀行之效能，實踐「銀行之銀行」之任務，普遍辦理重點現與轉抵押，參加公開市塲，凡有裨工商各業之資金，或長期投資或短期運用，均應儘量通過一般銀行，而達於生產之途一徑，使得有充分之發展，其於一般行莊憑碼之調劑，尤須視其緩急，力求靈活，務臻安定。至於金融網之分佈，宜採分行制度，金融政策之施行，宜採分區管理制度，在農業金融系統中，又應分別畏短期資金，而各樹立强有力之中央機構，辦理土地抵押推廣抵利農貸，提倡農業票據之重貼現及農產品之轉質押，並推行信用合作，農業保險等，皆為當前要圖。</p>
<p>（三）撤除消極管制從事積極輔導：現行管制銀行辦法，其主要省有卅五年三月公布之「財政部管理銀行暫行辦法」及本年二月公布之「加強金融業務管理辦法」，其中關於銀行營業之範疇，資金之運用，分支行之設置等，束縛重重，直使銀行有跬步　行，動　得　之概，不特阻碍銀行之營業，抑且影響　業之發展，應請政府符各種　時管制法令，僅量撤除，以利金融，而便工商之發展。</p>
<p>（四）頒布新銀行法樹立永久規模：新銀行法草案，業經立法院數次審查，前未　市銀行公會之建議，原地多有採納，惟修正草案仍有不少硬性之規定，為使根本大法得以順利施行，務須多設富有彈性之條文，要以積極輔導為主旨，深望政府於正式制定之前，重予本會貢獻意見之機會。</p>
<p>（五）進同業聯議充裕生產資金：我銀行同業亦當力求自肅，增進同業問這聯　與合作，務向增加生產之途徑，推進投資與貸款，以與國家經濟建設計劃，相互配合</p>
<p>（六）提倡銀行學術劃一制度程式：外國銀行事業之所以日進千里，銀行學術之進步，為其主因之一，我國對於銀行學術之提倡，不客稍緩，蓋欲發展銀行業務必先整飭同人生活，喚起研究學術之興趣，其他如會計制度，契約單據等之劃一，亦宜速盡可能，促使實現。</p>
<p>（七）謀取各業合作博得社會同情：欲使銀行得盡最大效用，實賴社會經濟之活動，工商各業之營運，與銀行業務配合無貫，舉如工商業之生產運銷，其具體之計劃，翔實之報吿，議為銀行業實貴之指針，必要之參考，而社會人士，對於安定市面，能多予一分之合作，亦即於金融多得一分之裨益。</p>
<p>總之，本會之所以　求於政府及金融當局者，不外樹立國家信用，加强金融機構，克盡調劑資金之功能，引導銀行正當之出路；而我銀行同業雖在此難困情形之中，仍當一秉以往之精神，擁護國策，協力推進，不論環境之順逆，成就之大小，務於發展經濟，安定民生社會，盡其最大努力，完成其應負之使命，則我同業今日集百人之精力，殫精竭慮，孜孜以求者，方有良好之成績，表現於社會，此本會所竭誠願望，並望社會各界寄予深切之同情與合作者。殷憂啓聖，多難興邦，果能循此邁進，則我國經濟金融之發展，必有燦爛光明之一日，我國家民族之前途，實利賴之，謹此宣言。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>萬元劵的發行問題</h3>
<p>近來因物價上漲，交易所需的紙幣，跟着增加。因之市上現鈔收付，非常不便。各行莊廠商都須雇用額外人員，專做點數工作。一般市民，也感到非常麻煩。而且因點數不便，大家懶得點，因此發生了許多爭執。少數不道德的人故竟攙入小額票，以弋取不法利得，彼此相欺，信用大受影饗。最近銀行公會聯合會在南京舉行第一次大會。特地議決，請中央銀行發行萬元大票，不失為一件適合社會需要的決議。</p>
<p>中央銀行所以未發萬元券及不願多發五百元關金券的原因，祗是因為發行關金券時，投機家就造謠，說將刺激物價，乘機互相抬價。因此中央不無顧慮。其實軍興以來，物價始終在上漲之中。爾時，無萬元券，乃至無五千元券，一般物價，並不因此而穩定。因為物價的上漲，其原因雖多，其主要之點，要不外於物資缺乏，和通貨膨賬。券額增高，當然可以助長通貨的膨脹，但通貨膨脹，並不以提高券額為必要條件。換句話說：券額雖小，而發行增加，通貨依然可以膨賬。反之，發行適宜，不使過於浮濫，則券額雖高，亦未必卽是膨賬，從而一般物價，亦未必卽為帶高。可知物價與券額，實在是兩件事，不可混為一談。</p>
<p>此次在銀行公會聯合會會塲上，有一位廣東的代表說，華僑匯款均須送至內地，而地方不靖，運送鈔票不易，以致華僑匯款，大為减少。又說，現在街上鈔票有貼水至每百元差九元的。如果中央銀行再不發行大額券，則華僑匯款勢必以無法繳款而絕跡了。情形之嚴重，已至如此地步！</p>
<p>所以銀行公會聯合會的請求，實在是基於實際的需要。本來通貨是交易的媒介品。現以物價高漲，底盤加大，其所需要的媒介品，自然不能不連帶增多。譬如戰前米價，不過十元左右，而現已漲至十六七萬。所幸普通法幣的票面，大部份已屬一二千元。十餘疊的鈔票，雖未必能完全點數，尙可勉强應付。假如仍照戰前，以五元十元券支付，試思事實上之累贅為何如！恐怕許多交易，將以支付之困難，而陷於不可能的地步了。</p>
<p>所以為穩定物價起見，與其限制券額，不許牠提高，母寗在發行額上加以限制，來得切實而有效。况且五百元票面的關金券，實際上無異於萬元券，萬元券的發行和流通，可說是已成的事實，不是眞正的創舉。所以我們的要求是：（一）在新的萬元券發行以後，應把小額券儘量收回，加以銷燬，以减少其授受上的困難，（二）注意地域上的需供情形，勿使偏重在幾個遊資過剩的少數地點，致加深膨脹的程度。（三）以發行萬元券為便利流通，减少小額券的手段，勿視為彌補赤字財政的捷徑。</p>
<p>有人以為發鈔和財政，早已打成一片，上述第三點，恐不免近於理想。這種顧盧，確也値得重視。不過增加發行額，不一定要假逕於萬元票，就是說：萬元票不發行，也未必就是通貨停止膨脹，或可以阻止通貨膨脹。而且發行萬元券的建議，還是出於全國銀行公會聯合會。其動機當然在於通貨本身，決沒有財政上的意味在內。據當局表示，短期內確將發行。但也是為靈活交易，切合需要起見，所以就事論事，我們始終認為發行萬元券，是合於目前的需要的。</p>

<h3>奧國疆界問題提付討論　外長會議再臨試煉　奧境德資產定義猶未確定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播：美國務鄉馬歐爾今晚要求討論奧國疆界問題，四強外長巳予回意。按該問題包括南斯拉夫對卡林西亞南部之要求在內，比項要求蘇聯表示贊成，而西方列強則表示對。此一問題倘不能獲得解決，則對奧和約勢必宜吿擱淺。馬歇爾與貝文雖未正式宣佈結束會議，惟二人鑒於對德對奧和約均無成立協議希望，成亟欲提前返國，馬氏本日之提議，殆欲再作一次試騐，以證明某方之政策苟非澈底改變，會議決無進展可能。兩小時會議之結果，雖在上節上略有進展，但並無有價値之成就可言。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕四國外長今日討論對奧條約中之奧境德國資產問題，意見並未　接近，故料對興和約已決不能在莫斯科會議中完成或簽字。馬歇爾力圖成立妥協辦法，然悉遭莫洛托夫之拒絕。馬歇爾乃表示「就莫洛洛托夫君之意見觀，奧國似不應取得自由與獨立，其經濟及出口似應受外國之管制，余覺吾人問之意見，越談距離越遠矣。如果接受莫洛托夫關於德國資產之建議，則奧國將成外國統治下之傀儡國，美國決不簽訂造成此等狀態之條約」。貝文及皮杜爾均表示準備接受馬歇爾所提關於奧境德資產之妥協建議。貝文亦認苜要任務在確定奧境德資產之定義。具文謂無人否認蘇聯有自德國資產獲得賠償之權，然就莫洛托夫建議之制度觀，蘇聯所接受之財產可使蘇聯控制奧國之經流利益，若根據莫洛托夫計劃可以移轉之一切工廠，土地，森林均被視為與興國經濟脫離，則恐奧國經濟將無復興之望。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕馬歇爾關於對奧條約第三十五條德國資產問題所提之妥協建議，意在使利成立關於此一問題之協議，以使對奧倏約得在本屆草斯科會議中完成。馬歇爾之建議內容如下：（一）奧國應承認四强有根據波茨坦協定關於德國賠償之規定，處置奧境德國資產之權，奧國應採取一切必要之措施，以便利此等炎產之移轉於四强；（二）德國資產之定義，乃德國政府或德國人民於一九四五年五月八日以前所享有之財產權或權益，而此等財產權或權益係德國政府或人民於一九三八年三月十二日即取得所有權者，或經德國政府或人民於一九三八年三月十二日以後非以暴力或脅迫所取得者；（三）前項資達經移轉於四强後，仍應受粵國法律之管轄，但奧國政府於和約生效後之一定期間內不　將其收歸國營；（四）波茨坦協定中所稱之奧國東部區域係指奧境蘇聯佔領區及維也納城之蘇聯區而言。馬歇爾認為於確定德國資產之定義後，即可立即進行此等資產之處置。關於此一定義之諒解成立後，四强之每一政府當採取必要措施，令奧政府立即將奧國東部區域內之此等資產正式移轉於蘇聯。</p>
<h3>外長會議雖陷僵局成立協議尙未絕望</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十九日電〕史達林元帥新近會與美國務卿馬歇爾會談，今日據獲悉其談話範圍之消息靈通方面稱：四國外長會議目前雖陷僵局，但不應視為對德和約將來並無成立協議之望。關於史氏與央外相貝文及法外長畢杜爾之談話，已因史馬會談而使其推測更顯有力。兩人均能表示政治家風度，對於促進世界各國之諒解，係屬一種供獻。時問頗為重要，我人無不需要時間。目下前途雖似暗澹，可以毋庸悲觀，最後必能得有解決，或尙須經過一兩次會議方有發展。克里姆林宮對於獲致協議之可能性及美國外交政策之前途，確未表示悲觀。</p>
<h3>德境英美佔區加緊經濟統一</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播：據悉自四强會議形成僵局後，英美兩國將加緊勢力促成英美兩佔領區之有效合併。英美希望法國加人會作，使德國西部三佔領區在經濟上獲得統一，但法國參加之顉望甚微。由於魯爾及萊　等問題，法國與英美意見不合，故三佔領區之合併，恐難實現。</p>
<h3>英外務部接到南斯拉夫抗議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕英國外務部今日正式宣布接到南斯拉夫政府之照會，措辭激烈，內容指責英國佔領軍在奧地利南卡林西亞省對史洛文族人之恐怖分動，並列舉種種例證。此間官方對於此種指資表示懷疑，但決　加以調查。</p>
<h3>奧內閣總理　將前往莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社維也納十八日電〕官方頃宣佈：奧地利內關總理斐格爾，將於本月二十二日啓程前往莫斯科。</p>
<h3>劉鍇論託管制度　謂其基本目標與我國國策相符</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日電〕我外次劉肅（刻為聯合國託管理事會我國代表）今單獨接見中央社記者時謂：中國認為託管理事會之工作極為重要，蓋其工作包括使非自治之數百萬人民獲得政治經濟及社會進展。劉氏指出託管制度之基本目標。完全與我國父孫先生之主義及我政府之指導政策相符合。託管地帶民族之進步對全世界其他非獨立民族有重大影響。記者請劉氏檢討三月二十六日以還理事會之工作。渠答稱：各管理國雖注意保持其於各領土之權力，並畏懼理事會之不適當干涉，惟理事會各代表間已漸產生一目標相同之精神，管理國家與非管理國家間之界限，已不如早時之顯明。劉氏認為刻有一鼓勵吾人之跡象，耶各代表漸覺彼等係負資一種工作，即注意託管地民族之福利。劉氏論理事會前途謂：理事會之成功，端賴管理國及非管理國各代表間之合作，並需要興論之支持。記者詢以理事會對處理向理事會提交及申請之程序規則，此向為理事曾所極注意者。劉氏謂：關於申請之程序規則，已根據公平自由之基礎擬就。劉氏謂理事會迄今皆係從事草擬程序規則，渠謂此初步工作極重要，蓋託管制度之全部開展，受此規定之約束。</p>
<h3>安理會通過查團留希　蘇聯建議遭否决　美援助希圭計劃獲一重要勝利</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十八日電〕安全理事會十八日拒絕蘇聯之決議案，即授權聯合國監督美國援助希臘一議。此乃美國獲得主要勝利及安理會擁護杜魯門建議援助希土計劃之謂也。先是安理會亦拒絕波蘭所提禁止美國之援助希臘，作為「政治武器」之建議，其意乃對蘇聯決議之修正，但亦主張授權聯合國監督美國之援助計劃。聯合國繼即決定成立一巴爾幹常設委員會，以監視越界及其他糾紛。此係美國所建議，由十一個安理會代表組織而成之。但蘇聯代表葛羅米柯極力反對，並聲言在表決時，渠將使用否決權。結果以九對〇票加以通過。蘇聯與波蘭拒絕投票，至此葛羅米柯即要求應儘速辯論其授權聯合國監督美國援助希臘一致之決議。美方當即聲稱，余可不必使用否決權反對蘇聯之建議，蓋現已有足够之國家反對蘇聯之提議，故無需美國使用否決權也。另悉，日內瓦之聯合國巴爾幹調查委員會現正在草擬希臘疆界糾紛事實之報吿。據該委員會秘書藍特上校透露稱，有關調查之某項文件已吿失蹤云。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾指責政府　並黍華萊士為共產黨</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕英國之戰時首相邱吉爾，今日在此間擁護保守黨者之民衆大會中演說，謂英國現正被　入破產，帝國巳被斷送，而印度更被無恥地拋業。渠批評政府之財政政策，謂社會黨政府，惟憑美國之佈施以生存，然獲　美國之借款，則浪費濫用，此項借款，祇應用於復興　後　國工業，始為合理。關於華萊士最近之訪英，邱吉爾稱華氏為共產黨，而缺乏解釋其目標之勇氣。邱古爾表示渠對利用友邦之招待以誹謗本國之人，殊不能忍耐。　認對蘇政策，應以實力為基礎，樹立榮譽的友誼，決不可綏靖以示弱。英國在外交方面應明白表示決不容離間英美間之關係，英國亦決不參加妨礙英語民族團結之任何行動。</p>
<h3>華萊士在瑞演說再指責好戰份子</h3>
<p>〔合衆社瑞典京城十八日電〕華萊士今日在此間瑞典京城大學公開集會中發表演說稱：美蘇二國人民皆念切需要和平，但不幸被宣傳所發炎，現有極多數之人以為世界仍是鼎分為三，資本主義，社會主義，共產主義各據一方，故吾人必須從事戰爭；此輩急進份子實為對全人類福利之罪犯。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕關於希臘左派聯合陣綫，邀請華萊士前往希臘聘問一事，頃悉：華氏業已婉辭，並謂將在最短期內返國云。</p>
<h3>遠東委員會確定日工農生產水準</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕遠東委員會頃宣佈，本會業已訓令麥帥立即依照一九三〇年及一九三四年日本工農業之生產永準，確定日本工農生產水準。本會相信此項水準，足以供給日本至一九五〇年為止之平時需要。若干重工業將減低至一九三〇至三四年之水準，但其他重要平時生產，則將抬高，良以一九三〇至三四年之生活水準，必須維持故也。</p>
<h3>對日和給細目美國正硏究中</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜頃在招待記者會上談稱：美國現續在硏究對日和約之詳細節目，進行已歷多時，但僅由國務院硏究其事，尙未與其他政府會同及此。至召開和會之期，則尙未定奪云。</p>
<h3>美內長克魯格主張　阿拉斯加設州　多數議員均表贊同</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕內政部長克魯格今日在衆院某小組委員會中力言阿拉斯加乃美國國防存亡所繫，且係未來對亞洲貿易之要樞，主張將該地改為州治。據稱，阿拉斯加之國防地位人盡皆知。吾人必須發展其農工商業以及各種職業俾支持陸海軍之防禦計劃。自舊金山經由阿留申羣島至日本之大圓形航空路綫，較諸取徑夏威夷羣島之舊道縮短約一千七百哩，前者或可成為通往日本與中國之主要空路。衆議員多人均贊成阿拉斯加設州，但稱美國在阿拉斯加建設適當防務不可操之過急。</p>
<h3>胡佛在參院外委會報吿　世界糧荒仍嚴重　救濟基金可望加速通過</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕參院外交委員會今日秘密聽取賑濟專家胡佛報吿世界明年將遭遇更大之糧食危局後，已籌備對三萬五千萬美元救濟基金，賑濟中國及歐洲五國一案，於本月二十二日採取行動。胡佛在該委員會報吿歐洲糧况完畢，出語報界稱，目前世界糧荒情形，明年將更嚴重，因歐洲先遇酷寒，後遭水災，且聯合國家拆散軸心國軍火工業，已摧毀可用以製造肥料之工廠云。</p>
<h3>日參議員選舉定今日起舉行</h3>
<p>預料保守派必獲勝利</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕日本選民將於明日選舉參議員二百五十名，左派候選人將努力競選，企圖打破保守黨所佔多數，但觀保守黨在新近地方選舉曾獲絕大勝利，則在本屆談會選舉中必仍可保持多數。按照新憲法，參議院係日本議會之上院，其功用在對衆議院維持制衡作用。衆議員定本月二十五日選舉。</p>
<h3>八國米糧會議下月在印舉行</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十八日電〕據悉：主要產米及食米之八國，將於五月十五日於印度南部特拉凡科爾之特拉凡得琅舉行會議，受聯合國農業及糧食組織邀請參加此項會議之國家為中，法（代表越南），印，荷（代表爪哇及東印度），美（代表日本及朝鮮），英（代表緬甸，錫關，馬來），暹羅及菲律賓等八國。會期四週，將討論如何增加米之產量及其他與米有關之經濟問題。</p>

<h3>推銷廣遠　破獲大規模偽藥機關　兩年來枉死者不知多少　主犯落綱抄出大宗原料</h3>
<p>最近市上僞藥充斥，影響市民健康至鉅。當局對此極爲注意。最近警備部稽査處第三稽査大除長張漢光接獲密報，飭由幹員尙武，周吉，張麟祥等偵査，於前日淸晨六時，以購藥爲由，得到僞藥證據，當於威海衛路四百號捕獲主犯高其龍，又在成都路永康里過街樓捕獲專負僞藥推銷之張良珠，兩地抄獲大批業已包裝完竣之僞藥及其原料等十餘大箱，此中以阿司匹靈，六〇六，及仁丹佔多數。據供，僞藥製造總機關說在蘇州，經營以來，歷時二載有餘，蘇州方面由馬姓負責製造藥品，上海方面則負包裝並推銷之責，偽造藥品計有拜耳藥廠出品之阿司匹靈，杜罵丁（嗎啡針），加當，新酒爾佛散，黑獅六〇六，信誼藥廠一天霖，科發大藥房沃古林，武田藥廠之皮膚病藥酒而膚，紅粒仁丹等十餘種，僞藥裝璜印刷，幾可亂眞，二年來遍銷京滬綫蘇州，無錫，常州，鎭江，南京，徐州，遠達華北北平，天津及東北各省。並據其自稱，僞造之沃古林眼藥水，曾有用此而致雙目失明，杜罵丁嗎啡針，病人用後五分鐘立即喪命者，其他僞藥，亦毫無藥劑成分，最近且擬擴大規模，鉅量製造云云。故此次若不破獲，後患將更不堪設想。一干人犯昨已移送稽査處偵訊，並正嚴緝其同黨（下圖爲高張兩犯及抄出之僞華·中國社）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案，犯有盜匪公共危險，竊盜等罪嫌之消防員二十三人，地院昨日開庭審理終結，定本月二十六日審判。</p>
<p>昨晨九時，梅爾和推事先提審盜匪罪嫌部份之尙志魁·李成鈞·戴光榮。蔡治英等四被吿，四人供詞與前無大差異，據證人消防處第一科科員萬聲鈞稱：本人曾於大火延燒時隨科長前往巡視，箱箱物件已被壓於坍牆下，似未曾動過。被吿辯護律師一致非難檢察官，認爲引用懲治盜匪條例不當。</p>
<p>傳訊證人多名</p>
<p>下午續審公共危險及竊盜罪嫌部份之黄寳琦。李　·朱慶欄等十九人，（其中周悅寰已病故），並傳到證人美軍消防隊長哥德門，新閘路美軍營站長巨可夫，消防處第一科科長王文濤，憲兵宋志鵬等多人。據哥德門稱：我於火災發生日午夜十二時十分到火塲，見有消防員十餘人在旁觀，至於是否輪流休息，則不得而知。我爲便於灌救起見，曾拔槍擊破窗上玻璃，惟中國消防員因何不擊破窗及擊穿屋頂施救，則不能明瞭其原因。巨可夫則稱：本人僅負責保護美軍營，對灌救時情形不甚淸楚。第二十三團憲兵宋志鵬稱：曾見若干消防員在對面裁縫店內談笑，又在火塲中見消防員吃糖果。並謂，拿東西的事是有的，但不能確指何人。</p>

<h3>關外新學府　長春大學</h3>
<p>— 本報瀋陽記者趙展</p>
<p>長大學生都很守紀律同，一般的東北學生都有守紀律的美德。</p>
<p>國立長春大學成立的歷史很短，在很短的期間所發生的問題倒很値得注意而長大的前途，正是注意東北敎育的人們所十分關切的。長大於去冬開學，現在正面臨一個荒蕪的春天。春意在靑年學子心理上的影饗非常深刻，怎樣開拓這春天的荒地，不僅是長大一校的問題，同時也是東北敎育界的大問題。</p>
<p>大學敎育思想問題，近幾年來特別引起社會人士的注意，許多學者與專家用心研究它。在東北，這一個問題尤其重要。東北靑年與關內靑年對政治的希望與衝動性是一致的，而感受現實的苦悶與煩惱，要比關內靑年敏感，也更富有危險性。一般說米，東北靑年的政治認識極爲膚淺，東北靑年的思想方向也需要積極的領導。以積極的方式去領導他們，並且鼓勵他們的自信心，是最聰明的辦法。卑棄他們，强制或放任，都是愚蠢的行爲。舉一個例子來說：去年長大校長黄今如先生晋京述職時，對記者談東北敎育問題，談到東北靑年受的「奴化」敎育最深刻。東北靑年聽了大爲不滿，長大的學生也在此間報紙的讀者投書欄中對「奴化」兩字怒吼起來。事實是事實，但語言却刺痛了東北靑年的愛國心，由此可以證明，日本在東北的敎育是一敗塗地。</p>
<p>長大六院二十三系的學生，二千餘人，現在集中在僞滿工業大學的舊址上課。宿舍是偽滿時日籍官員的住宅，相距不遠。長大原接收了不少房子，冬天因爲煤少，不得不集中在一起上課。春天他們可以修理所接收的一些少門無窗的房子，夏天就很愜意了。我去參觀他們的膳堂，那原來是僞滿工大的附屬工廠，所有的機器早搬了家，學生三餐高梁米，早上是稀飯，午餐晚餐每人有一碗白菜湯，油少得可憐，他們的生活是很苦的。淸寒學生與靑年軍復員學生佔百分之八十，他們都是公費生，自費生不渦是百分之廿。他們的登養與衣着，和戰時後方大學的學生一樣，表面上看來，他們穿的衣服雖不十分襤褸，但絕談不上整齊，有百分之八十的學生談不到家庭接濟。</p>
<p>書本與敎授，在長大都是問題。書本供應困難，除日文書籍外，根本沒有參考書，在敎學方面這是很繁重的工作。敎授之中兼職者很多，有些以執敎作副業，時常缺課。學生對此很不滿意，因爲學生求知慾甚迫切，覺得缺了一課堂，便是欠了他們一筆賬。都希望這一種現象能早日改善。敎授的方言也成了大間題，有一位湖南籍的哲學敎授，學生聽不懂他滿口的湖南話，幸而這位敎授是日本留學生，日本語說得很好，便改用日語講授，但非東北籍的靑年軍復員學生便　有辦法了。又因爲學生程度不齊，敎授方面只能向程度較低的學生看齊，因此經濟系三年級的學生還上簿記課程，程度較高的學生便覺枯燥乏味，文學院中有新聞學一科，聽講的人很擁擠，大槪因爲新聞學是較新鮮的東西，據說長大下學期要增設新聞系。</p>
<p>長大的學生都很守紀律，一般的東北學生都有守紀律的美德。在學校當局的管理方面，便强調紀律一點。靑年學生之需要紀律化，在東北是有其價値的，當今之國家社會，所給與靑年的精神刺激太多，其影響十分深刻，靑年學生感情雖然豐富，畢竟不太理智，如對學生的行爲不稍加約束，一任其放縱，不但影饗學生學業，對其身心及道德之敗壞更爲可怕。長大學生在守紀律方面，由一件事上可以看出來，他們現在上課的敎室與宿舍離開大禮堂約五里路遠，每星期一學生都自動跑去作紀念週，沒有人偸懶。學校當局對學生之約束較內地大學嚴格，學生並沒有覺得他們的自由被剝奪了。因爲他們已習慣了紀律的生活，並無不便之感。</p>
<p>因爲長大的份子包括偽滿十七個大學的學生，這一種組合內容非常複雜。封建意識仍然作祟，形戌了小集團的對立，甚至於公開鬧起來。在法學院選舉學生自治會主席時，曾一時大打出手，後來軍官學校派佔了上風。這一種派別之爭，對於學校的未來的紀律不無影響，到現在爲止，派別的鴻溝顯然存在，在學校說來，固屬不幸。無論如何，他們的自治會是組織起來了。</p>
<p>長大學生有儉樸作風，他們的物質生活很苦，但却能刻苦自立，奮勉向學，約有五分之一的學生是半工半讀。他們以如此好學的精神，來愛護這一個學校，長大的前途是光明的。四月十四日於長春。</p>

<h3>市長召米業代表談話　查出黑市立予嚴懲　市府拋米每石限十三萬五千元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長對於抑平本市米價問題，堅求澈底實現，異有極大信心。昨日上午九時，特召見本市米號業代表崔振華·楊潤會·胡成鋼·經售商査寳山·楊久慈，南市塲印福祥·胡文安，北市塲徐頌仁·蔡聲明等九人，晤談甚久。吳市長表示，現產米區價格巳趨降落，本市米價亦應回跌。望來商共體時艱，不得囤積投機。至於本市每日所需食米九千担，政府決以限價十三萬五千元配給拋售。若此後仍有黑市情事，一經査出，定予嚴懲不貸。</p>
<p>抑平米價　三大決策</p>
<p>吳市長於召見糧商後，接見記者談：平抑米價之決策三項：（一）本市抑平物價，自二月經濟緊急措施方案施行後，已從經濟政治二方面雙管齊下，米價上漲影響民生最鉅，市府繼續拋售白粳秈米，直至本市米價與產地平衡爲止。今日本市限價已略有提高，惟祗許下跌不許上漲，抑平至十四萬四千之目標，以與產地之十三萬元平衡。（二）抑平產地米價，自主席十三抵滬，命嚴令推行後，十五日中央即派幹員協同江蘇省政府着力執行，市府存米現有十三萬噸，計四十五萬包，且洋米及川米皆續有運到拋售無問題，短期米價一定下跌。（三）如有超過限價情事，當局已訂有取締辦法，定予嚴懲不貸。市府已電吿警局，違者即予拘捕。</p>
<p>偵查米號　抬高售價</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟偵察人員昨又查出歐陽路大新米號及義興米號高抬市價，並有團積嫌疑。大新米號曾於十八日下午四時，將白粳以十八萬元一石，洋秈以十七萬元一石之黑市價格出售。義興米號則將白粳喊高至每石二十萬元。昨晨警察局行政處第四科，將大新號賬房劉輔卿，及義興號經理劉永昌傳至局內詢問，並予拘押以做傚尤。</p>
<p>產地步跌　粳幣續瀉</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧三千六百餘石，配米續拋，內地步跌，店胃冷懈，市塲交易淸閒，轉成供過於求。粳秈米一致繼續猛跌萬元，自元陰元亦相繼回挫五千元。</p>
<p>麵粉實銷淸淡，再低一二千元，麩皮續削二千元，豆餅賣氣甚盛，猛跌二三千元。黄豆以油餅下游，去化不振，挫落三四千元。</p>
<p>油市疾退甚速，暴跌二三萬元。生仁去化呆滯之極，劇降二萬元。芝蔴隨各物下瀉萬元，紅糧跟跌二三千元，苞米納戶看望，小三四千元。惟彔豆貨稀形堅，蠶豆零化活潑，盤升二三千元。</p>
<p>食油因販遠商另售商油廠等，均會同油商業公會加强拋售平價油，並禁止食油類出口，壓力甚鉅，頓成慘跌之象。</p>
<h3>統債堅秀</h3>
<p>公債昨人心仍好，全國銀聯會有種種提案，且聞外埠法院判決之倍數更高，買氣漸動。統丙自晨初一三八〇〇元低價，返步盤上，最後升至一五〇〇〇元外結束，收後喊價續昂，結果較前收計各價均吿回漲一千餘元，成交約六百萬。</p>
<h3>外股平庸</h3>
<p>外股昨平庸而已，中途微現疲軟，黑市匯水之向榮，最後仍現穩健。怡紗自晨初四〇六〇〇元起，中途破入四〇〇〇〇元關，最後仍在關外徘徊，結果較前收計電話會德豐平平，紙業航業墾植業廣各升半成强，餘吿微漲。</p>
<h3>四行兩局匯款　滙率略加修正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市四行兩局匯往各地匯款匯率，自二十一日起，又略加修正。增加各區：廈門每千元收三十元（原爲二十五元），廣西區三十元（原爲十五元），長沙五五元（原爲三十元，衡陽五五元（原爲三十五元），湖南區其他各地五五元（原爲四〇元），河南區五五元（原爲三十五元），蕪湖十五元（原爲十元），漢口·武昌五〇元（原爲三十五元），沙市·宜昌五五元（原爲四〇元），湖北區其他各地五五元（原爲四〇元），南昌十元（原爲五元）。减低件區：靑島五元（原爲八元），重慶二元（原爲五元），四川區除重慶·成都·叙府·萬縣外，其他各地五元（原爲八元），雲南區二元（原爲五元）。又新添萬縣一處，匯率每千元八元。其他各地區，匯率仍照舊。</p>
<p>據悉：自匯往廣州。汕頭等地匯率一再高漲後，匯往兩地匯款，常多由廣西轉匯，故廣西區匯率亦吿提高。又近來以華中區新棉登塲，亟需資金採購。而各地交通不便如故，影響現鈔之調撥。故對華中各地匯率，亦吿提高。商業銀行對漢口長沙之匯率，均在八九十元之譜云。</p>

<h3>陝北散記（三）　延安以北</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張僊洲　八日自西安寄</p>
<p>陝北之戰，中共在他的「防衛戰」中，一直是在戰略上估計鉛了，延安之戰是這樣，延安附近及以北的瓦窰堡等地的戰役，也一直是這樣。</p>
<p>八日下午，第一戰區謝副參謀長底作戰報吿上這歲說：「在理想中，我們以爲延安之戰，共軍因陳發部由晉調至延用以西，距延安尙有八十——一百里路，延安已吿光復，所以這批生力軍沒跟上「保衛毛主席」，「大延安」就已經「失了。」我們以爲在延安以北，總怕難免要發生一塲惡戰。事實上，滿不是這回事，我軍還是順利的追擊。」</p>
<p>瓦窰堡周圍　佈置了重兵</p>
<p>在克復複延安之後，國軍作了三天的虛淸附近殘共的工作。二十四日開始前進。這時候，共軍的指揮部已移向瓦窰堡。在共軍的估計中，國軍會趁攻克延安之一股說氣，一定北攻瓦窰堡，所以在瓦窰堡周圍，布下了重兵，想在這一帶給進攻的國軍一點顏色看。據我們聽到的當時共軍警三旅四旅在蟠龍鎭，三五八旅在永平，敎導旅在永平以北，新八旅在瓦窰堡，新九旅在丹頭，譽一旅二旅在安定附近。當然，實際人數並沒有這麽多，但番號確是這些。從這裏看出，當時共軍對瓦窰堡的防衛，相當嚴密。同時宣稱，一要重回延安。」</p>
<p>攻克吳家寨　最精彩一幕</p>
<p>攻擊的開始，是先以少部分國軍，向北緩進，佯攻蟠能，永平一帶，事實上，以主力向延川進擊，同時，在延長以南，也有國軍配合由臨眞北進。二十七日攻至于谷驛，二十八日東進的部隊克復了延川，延長外圍的共軍殘衆，因腹背受敵，歸路已斷，倉皇潰散，延長也爲國軍攻克。三十日掃蕩延川延長附近。這時，共軍已由西調回兩個旅，東援淸澗·三十一日幾經激戰之後，共軍潰散，淸澗又吿攻克。</p>
<p>從延川到淸澗，再北去即是綏德，這是一條大路，正像洛川到延安一樣。所以在國軍攻入淸澗之後，共取乃以爲國軍已改變路綫，這一來是沿公路北進，作正面猛攻，所以又調回一批兵力，佈防在綏德以南，靜待國軍北上。但是國軍却迴襲瓦窰堡，並於四月三日予以克復。四日開始向東北追擊。同時，拿下了吳家寨，在那裏，把共軍的輜重俘獲了不少。重要者有廣播電台，汽車，新華印刷廠，紗廠……等。延安之戰以後，這一役應算是最精彩的一幕了。</p>
<p>「第二延安」可能是五台</p>
<p>國軍攻下延安之後，陝北共軍雖然氣餒，但未絕望，所以在那幾天當中，共軍每於一地易手以後，多向西北潰退，這一跡象是說明着延安雖「失」，但共軍對陝北尙未忘情，他們在待機反攻，所以「重回延安」不是虛張聲勢，而是有此力，有此意。</p>
<p>三月二十四至四月三日這十天，國軍的勝利（前進四二〇華里），改變了共軍的這種想法，據我在延安聽到的情報，說共軍主力在瓦窰堡易手之後，已開始向東退。同時，六日晚，共軍王震部以四個旅的番號，八個團的實力，在吳家南，永平以北，由西向東突擊。同時，瓦窰堡的共方守軍，也例外的是不向西北面向綏德方面潰退。從這兩件事上可以看出，共軍對陝北，可能不再固守，不付出主力。在必要時，主力東撤，留下些遊擊隊，再設法趁機復起，至於共軍的「第二延安」，應是何處，據共軍俘虜稱；「可能在山西五台。」</p>
<p>胡宗南將軍　談陝戰前途</p>
<p>陜北在短期內的戰爭，是怎樣發展的呢？記者會走詢許多高級人員，他們的意見，綜台起來，應該有兩點：第一，國軍的目的是在打破共軍的老巢，使共方了解政府的威力，並不想說要殺人若干以示衆。「戰爭的策略，打回人心者是上策，圍聚而殲滅者是下策。」（某高級長官語）我們判斷在陝北，不會有多大規模的戰爭，變方也不會犧牲更多的人。第二，國軍的戰略，將可能趨於正面團攻。在最近兩天，楡林的國軍可能南攻米脂，另一路克横山，下靖邊，可能和寗　罵部國軍會師，而後再向西南與延安北上國軍會師，這麽一來，國軍在陜北對共軍的三面包圍，就完成了，等不着縮緊包圍圈，恐怕淸澗和米脂兩地國單的鉗形，就會使共軍主力在打一二次猛戰，即抽身東波，留下一部份作抵抗，作游擊。</p>
<p>胡宗南將軍在七日晚的紀者招待會中說：「……我看在這個目底以前，綏德可以拿下來，在五月底以前，陜北全部即可以逐漸恢復。」那麽未來的一個半月，應該是陝北之戰之尾聲。（四，八，脫稿於西安。）</p>
<h3>新銀行法之特徴及其要義</h3>
<p>— 張肇元</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>我國銀行法，自民國二十年三月二十八日國民政府公布後至今已達十六年，迄未施行，惟儲蓄銀行法，自民國二十三年七月四日公布同日施行，至今雖有十二年餘之久，其中八年抗戰，社會經濟變化萬端，政府對於銀行之管制不得不隨時發布命令或訂立辨法，於是政府有顧此失彼之慮，銀行有無所適從之苦。民國三十四年八月戰事結束，經濟將趨平時狀態，立法院財政經濟兩委員會奉孫院長命，開始整理銀行法會，推張肇元，馬寅初，樓桐孫，陳長蘅，戴修駿，衛挺生，狄膺，劉通，李慶　，姚傳法，黄芸蘇，陳紫楓，簡貫三，李元白，劉不同，孫九錄等十六委員初步審査，並由張肇元爲召集人，着手起草，其中硏討多次，七易其稿，方於民國三十六年四月十二日經財政經濟兩委員會聯席會議決定，乃至立法院大會詳細討論，於同年四月十七日第三二二次院會經過一讀保留二讀程序矣。今就修正銀行法之動機，修正銀行法之原則，及修正銀行法之經過，分述於後：</p>
<p>修芷銀行法之動機，可分爲三：</p>
<p>（一）民國二十年三月二十八日公布之銀行法，迄未施行，與其謂爲修正舊銀行法，不如謂爲訂立新銀行法，方爲正確。十年以來，一切銀行管制，或以命令，或訂辦法，在戰時政治經濟動盪不安，因時制宜，人民忍受無怨，在平時一切漸趨安定，不能不有遵律明文規定爲政府與人民互相法循之準繩。</p>
<p>（二）舊銀行法旣未施行，儲蓄銀行法亦不合時宜，此外信託公司爲銀行之一種錢莊爲銀行初創以前已有數百年歷史之地方金融機構，外國銀行於不平等條約撤銷後，其法律上地位與前不同，均有明定於一法之必要。</p>
<p>（三）銀行爲百業之樞鈕，無論農工商及其他一切事業，乃至個人，均需金融機構助現其款項之收付與存欠，使生產與消費問血液之流通與活躍，所以銀行與其他各業息息相關，其在社會中之重要性，可以想見。欲求百業之進步，必先有穩妥健全循規蹈矩之金融機構，如此則銀行法之速定實爲必要。</p>
<p>修正銀行法之原則</p>
<p>修正銀行法原則，可分為十：</p>
<p>（一）除國家銀行及省縣銀行另有條例外，凡民營或政府與人民合營之銀行統轄於一法之中，依據管制金融事業之經騐及金融事業之需要，廣採博取，容納於一法之中，廓淸以前所有命令辦法，槪括要點，期埀久遠，簡單明瞭，求合現實，使銀行法以外別無曲解或變更銀行法眞意之補充條文。</p>
<p>（一）分銀行爲五種，各按其所屬種類，分別進行業務，享受權利及履行義務，其已經核准設立經營業務者，或准維現狀，或陸續改正，其呈請設立者必須嚴格遵守新銀行法，務期不久之將來，各稱銀行納入正軌，不容掛羊頭賈狗肉，共趨一途，影響平行之發展。</p>
<p>（三）增加法律彈性，避免削足適履，簡化政府干涉，勉勵自由發展，例如銀行資本，因幣値不定及各地經濟狀况不同，不予肯定，由中央主管官署將全國劃分區域，分別核定，（第十九條），銀行之保證準備金得以公債庫券公司債等抵充，俾政府與銀行兩得其便，（第四十八條，第五十七條，第六十七條等），政府之管制以區爲標準，並以一區之經濟金融貿况爲根據，同區之中，不容厚彼薄此，有所歧視。</p>
<p>（四）實事求是，杜絕虛僞掩飾，偏重輔導，剔除消極約束，査過去法令因時値非常，不能不以嚴格限制，頭痛治頭，脚痛治脚，於是銀行爲自身利害計，不得不陽奉陰道，避重就輕，始則少數嘗試取巧，繼則多數效尤，相習成風，最後行虛作僞，爲公開之秘密，異銀行重信之本旨背道而她，去弊反以助惡，顯遠立法之意，所以新銀行法一面放買業務上之目由發展，按共匯類，分別規定，例如放款以存款總額爲標準，（第二十九條至第五十一條，第五十二條，第六十一條至第六十三條，第七十一條至七十四條，第八十六條，第九士二條及第九十四條等），一面嚴厲取締假帳。（第四十三條及第七十九條等。）</p>
<p>（五）確定體系，適用全國，中央主管官署旣可將全國劃區分別核定資本，並可訂定某區　　銀行需資若千，某種銀行兼營其他銀行業務者，需資若干，（第十九條），復可視各地區經濟金融情形，禁止增設銀行或某種銀行，（第二十三條），例如我國幅員遼闊，經濟情形相去遠甚，適於東南者未必適於西北，通都大邑所過剩者，或爲邊地僻壤所迫切需要，新銀行法具有高度伸縮性，適應各地不同之環境，並調劑各地不同之供求。</p>
<p>（六）各種銀行，因業務性質之不同，分別規定。商業銀行首重靈活，實業銀行貴在穩定，儲蓄銀行旨在嚴格保障儲戶，信託公司必須切實履行信託契約，而錢莊則重其習慣，各種銀行均以重信求實爲根本原則，例如商業銀行不强其投資於實業，（第五十條），實業銀行非偏重於實業放款不可，（第五十八條及第六十條）專業銀行且提高其事業放款至百分之五十以上，儲蓄銀行及信託公司在一定條件下，令其負責人負連帶無限責任，（第七十七條及第八十八條）而錢莊之信用放款，提高至百分之五十以下。（第九十四條）。</p>
<p>（七）信託公司業務範圍之廣，原爲任何銀行所不及，信託公司亦望包羅萬象，無所不爲，舉凡銀行，信託，保險，公證，地產，股票，建築，法律，會計，以及人事上之生前死後，莫不欲盡量羅致，惟我國信託事業，正在萌芽，能吾有此强大胃納，固屬疑問，且對於律師，會計師，建築師等，須經考試方爲合格之業務，似未便爲信託公司應有之業務，有侵及自由職業之嫌，而第八十六條規定信託公司執行信託業務，涉及法律會計人事及其他不屬於財務之事項，應委託登記合格執行業務之律師會計師或其他專門技師爲之，實免除信託公司發生重大過失，亦保障信託人之利益妥全也。</p>
<p>（九）錢莊有悠久之歷史，相沿之習慣，及堅强之地方性，我國銀行尙未普遍全國之今日，城鎭鄉村不能不有錢莊以調劑地方金融，雖通都大邑之錢莊，不乏大於銀行者，以全國計，錢莊較小於銀行，實居多數，新銀行法准許錢莊之存在及設立，（第七章，）重視其地方習慣，（第九十三條，）並依其習慣，放寬信用放款之限額，（第九十四條，）除商業銀行業務外，得兼營營其他銀行業務，（第九十五條，）祗因其地方性重及各地錢業習慣頗多不同之處，限制分設，（第九十六條，）且於其資本合於銀行最低資本額時，應改稱爲銀行，（第九十三條第二項，）庶在相當時期後，我國經濟力强時，全國普設銀行，以錢莊爲歷史上名稱可矣。</p>
<p>（九）外國銀行之規定，不採英之寬縱主義，亦不採美之緊縮辦法，就我國自身立塲，經濟上需要，及外國銀行在我國境內將近百年之歷史，爲決定立法意旨之因素。我國需要外資助我建設爲旣定之經濟政策，而外資較多，利率較低，亦爲不可否認之事實，且我國對外貿易缺乏聯繫，辦理外匯，尙無聯珠式之機構，似不能不借重外國銀行，以拓展我國外貿易，並爲我國銀行分設國外之先導，故新銀行法准許外國銀行經營商業銀行業務，以利我對外貿易及實業銀行業務，以助我國內建設，（第一百零二條，）至其不得兼營儲蓄銀行或信託公司之業務，（第一百零三條，）及限　其所收定期存款，運用於我國境內，（第一百零五條，）爲極合理論之規定，絕無歧視之意思，第一百零一條，外國銀行可設之區域，與第二十二條意旨相同，尤合情理。</p>
<p>（十）銀行爲公司之一種，依公司法第十二條規定，公司分爲五種，即設立銀行，可就五種公司中擇一組織，而外國銀行亦即外國公司之一種，可按公司法外國公司之規定申請特許，所以銀行申請營業登記，外國銀行申請特許及銀行之其他登記，其程序與規費，準用公司法之規定，所以簡化登記手續，予中外銀行以便利也，銀行法爲公司法之特別法，故普通法旣有之規定，於此特別法中不　列焉。</p>
<p>以上十點，就其大者，故曰原則。此外條改與新增之處，及文字上推敲之結果，散見各條，恕不枚舉。關於銀行會計，在草案中原有若干條文，祗因商業會計法正在立法院審査中，不久當可通過公布，使全國商業會計有統一辦法，故新銀行法中亦不列焉</p>
<p>民國二十年三月二十八日公布之銀行法，旣未施行，民國二十三年七月四日公布施行之儲蓄銀行法與新銀行法之儲蓄銀行規定，大同小異，故無逐條比較之必要。實業銀行信託公司錢莊以及外國銀行，前無規定，今乃始創，尤無比較之對象，故亦從略。</p>
<p>修訂法律，最宜注意三點：（一）是否切合現實，可以推行順利。（二）是否放大伸縮，可以普及全國。（三）有否盡其投能，可以埀之久遠。筆者雖以年餘之光陰，詳細研究，殊無盡善盡美之把握，此次修訂銀行法，困難尤多，舉其大者，約有五點：</p>
<p>（一）抗戰期中，通貨膨賬，至今戰事結束，將達二年，幣値尙未穩定。以後如何更難揣測，且有若干地區，情形特殊，有地方通用之幣，故儿應定數字之處，不得不另求計算之標準。</p>
<p>（二）我國幅員遼闊，民情懸殊，經濟金融相差更甚，欲求一適合伶地共同之標準，勢不可能，且戰時情形固與早時不同，戰後情形亦未必與戰前類似，在此經濟變化劇烈之時期中，前者不足爲法，後者不易捉摸，而又不能憑空下筆，閉門造車。</p>
<p>（三）各方意見雖廣泛徴求，多不免以自身利害關係爲出發點，各有立塲，各有理由，見仁見智，使居中者難下斷語，而又不能以折中妥協爲盡其能事。</p>
<p>（四）我國錢莊歷史悠久，積習甚深，銀行事業歷史雖暫，複雜殊甚，發展之過程不同，管制欲求統一，遂匪易事，立法標準低，則顧此失彼，捉襟見肘，立法標準高，則規避取巧，有法難行，欲求不高不低，寬嚴適中，人人便於遵守，亦匪易事。</p>
<p>（五）平時立法，應以積種輔導獎勵，以代非常時期之消極限制約束，理所當然。然近年經營銀行業者，絕大多數固在經營其銀行業務，但亦不乏以銀行爲標榜，經營投機，操縱囤積居奇之流，積極轉導獎勵，反有利於此輩，而消極限制約束，不免有害正當之銀行業者，良莠不齊，皂白難分，於是輔導獎勵之中，仍不免有限制約束之跡。</p>
<p>以上困難，不易克服，所訂如是，權作嘗試，留爲後來賢達借鏡可突。</p>

<h3>拉飛爾的繪畫</h3>
<p>— 徐帆</p>
<p>有一天，正當拉飛爾作畫時，一悠遠道的朋友進來，望着這位藝術家的工作：「你畫得很有成績，拉飛爾…」他激情地說「我剛從佛羅稜斯回來，我多麼希望你能看到黎阿奴多的繪畫，這般的馬呀！他們的四足　着地，他們的髮蠶暴怒地震顫。我不否認派露琪奴是一個很好的畫家——但是，但是黎阿奴多的馬呀」！</p>
<p>拉飛爾悴然地丟開他身邊的畫筆。「到那兒去」？他的朋友問，拉飛爾情急地回答：到佛羅稜斯去」。</p>
<p>拉飛爾曾常常聽到關於佛羅稜斯的美好，派露琪奴也時常與學生提起住在那城市中的偉大藝術家，講述他們大理石的宮庭，描繪那可愛的園圈，與他們講關於大教堂裏，那比世界上任何建築物都來得美好的圓屋頂。拉飛爾的心中充滿了到美麗的佛羅稜斯的願望。</p>
<p>現在，他到了這美麗的城市了，他很快的被佛羅稜斯的偉大藝術家所熟悉與喜愛；他的美貌，他溫和的面容使他到任何一個地方熱熟識了許多朋友。他工作室內的美麗的畫得得了人的讚慕，其中有一幅呌「園圈的聖瑪利亞」是在佛羅稜斯畫的，現仍掛在巴黎的藝術陳列室。</p>
<p>佛羅稜斯是羅馬的大城市，它以美麗的繪畫和奇偉的建築為著名，其中有一座羅馬教皇的宮庭，呌伐的庚，它有一千多間房屋，許多房屋的牆上全畫有畫，羅馬教皇時時刻刻注意着有名的藝術家，為他們出訪。當拉飛爾二十五歲那年，接到從羅馬教皇發來的請帖，邀他到羅馬去作伐的庚宮內的一部份畫。</p>
<p>那羅馬後，拉飛爾第一步工作是畫羅馬教皇宮庭的壁畫，羅馬教皇非常喜歡拉飛漿　在那裏的工作，他決心讓他佈置整個伐的庚宮殿的大廳。</p>
<p>這殿內有許多派路琪奴與其他藝術家的畫，為了拉飛爾來畫，羅馬教皇令把這些畫全部弄走，拉飛爾聽到為了他工作而把他先生的畫弄走，心中感到非常不安，他請示羅馬教皇讓派路琪奴的畫留着，這些畫在羅馬仍可以見到。</p>
<p>有一幅「聖母坐像」在這畫中，我們看見小天使親愛地躺在母親的懷裏，如母親抱着自己的孩子一般，這畫全的情節，古代傳說中有一段很動人的記載。</p>
<p>拉飛爾的畫裏幾乎都有可愛的孩子，你看聖母坐像中的年青聖約翰·瑗，和西克斯丁教堂中之聖母圖的小安琪兒，這都告訴說這些驚人的畫中的安琪兒都是手屈一指。</p>
<p>還有拉飛爾的色彩，你注意看，它是十分溫和而又熱情充沛的，有如燦爛的日落時那種幾乎是幻想般的力量。他畫布上的顏色塗得薄而透明，他畫中的綫條有時看來要差些。</p>
<p>在羅馬，拉飛爾的作畫是驚人的，他像意大利時那些偉大的藝術家一樣成了名，有些人稱他為世界上最偉大的藝術家。在他的工作室裏擠滿了藝術家，他們希望能發掘到一些他畫的嚴密，這也告訴說拉飛爾是被這許多學生敬愛着，有些時候，就像這樣五十多個人和他一齊散步在街上，他們是十二萬分的喜歡接近這繪畫老師的。</p>
<p>你看到全部西克斯丁尼教堂之聖母圖，一定會感到非凡的美麗，那是拉飛爾聖母圖中最可愛的一幅，它存在德國，在德雷斯登附近的一間單獨的屋內掛着，當人們看到這上面的母親和天使時，他們的眼裏盈溢了淚水，大家不由地高舉起帽子，寂然無聲地走過去。這屋裏非常靜，就是最輕微的驚響也能夠聽見。</p>
<p>拉飛爾不幸於三十八歲時逝世，但他卻永遠地活在所有看過他畫的人們的心中，沒有誰再能看到另一個畫家的畫，有他的那麼被人喜愛，那麼動人與完美。</p>
<h3>題畫詩</h3>

<h3>詩二首</h3>
<p>— 翁</p>
<p>哭松岑詞丈</p>
<p>卻後蟲沙　　翠，又駕　獄失嶙峋；平生忤物由天忌，今日恩公祇夢親；老去輪　家國恨，窮時詞賦米　辛；西山楓落其吳歌歇，（丈數邀賞西山紅葉未果）猶念江干寂寞人。</p>
<p>風　出手老猶恢，野史亭花面面開；氣節空能辭　軒冕，幽憂只許臥蒿萊；人憐天意輕儒術，我為江山慘霸才；夜起哭公成窈窕，更無帷影照深杯。</p>

<h3>觀紅薇老人畫展</h3>
<p>— 陳閎慧仲陶</p>
<p>紅薇老人繪事研精，譽馳海內外，此次在滬舉行畫展，慧忝在發起之列，不可無一言。老人之畫，設色用筆，　古幽逸，最得宋畫之神。而其題畫之作，詩字俱妙，如蘆蟹云：「重陽新釀鬱金香，佳會持　　蟹黃，我欲倒筐聽郭索，旁行歸到水雲鄉。」紅鸚鵡吊鐘花云：「曉起開簾月未沉，曲廊　砌碧雲深；苑前莫訝霜鐘寂，烏語能傳梵隕音。」雙鴨菰蒲云：「三月江南景物殊，桃花水暖長新　；竹弓勸汝休輕射，鬥鴨臨風解自呼。」紅杜鵑花杜鵑烏云：「紅　青山愛此花，三春三月下三巴；催歸雙烏真饒舌，不是行人不憶家。」皆卓卓可傳。自來畫工筆花鳥者，最難於古逸之中，有生動之致。故活色生者，斯為絕詣。惟老子之畫，始足當之。老人及門弟子，無慮五千人；惟吳黃卓羣女士，能得其真傳。所作畫，靈秀超逸，高者幾可亂真。因論老人之藝事，特牽率書之。</p>
<h3>從古代美與近代美的特質　論新世紀藝術創造</h3>
<p>— 沈雁</p>
<p>文藝復興以後的根據個性自覺之近代文化以及近代藝術，是恰與古代完全相反的個性美的表現。近代人的生活信念與精神可謂就是尊重個性，換句話說，這是表示人代替神而為至上存在，並且隨着人間思想文化之發達，有了理想與美的轉換</p>
<p>不可諱言的，近代人的個性美較古代人的封建理想美自由的多；而且就是因這個緣故，近代社會比古代社會應該有較高的文化評價。再說在所有的意味上，近代人或近代社會文明的進步，或許簡直不能與古代相比，這也是不容懷疑的事實。可是反過來說，在文化進步的美名之下，陷於極度尊重個性，而引起思想分裂，在不知覺之間，失去對於神的崇敬，忘卻共同生活的歡喜，不關心民族理想美的追求，也是不可否認的事實。</p>
<p>古代有古代的理想和美，近代有近代的理想和美，這是因為社會條件各異，理所當然。因此古代的全體性之美，和近代的個性美，不典能同一並論，也是理所當然。是我們值得反省的問題。</p>
<p>古代美是在埃及的紀念碑構想，巴比倫的勇武象徵，希臘理想美的表現，這三個題目中有他獨自的發展，也就在這上面構成全體民族偉大的主題。將他們古代人的文化意志以「永遠的構成」形式表現在這形美術上。換言之，就是「民族藝術的創造」。可是同時他有他的缺點，就是是將個人及個性力量估量得過小的封建政治或專制政治的藝術生產，反之，近代美是以顯現個性為目的之官感性或自由性，為其特質，而且好像較着重織細的神經銳敏的感覺；且以有知性的藝術表現為其主體。尤其在印象派以後的近代美術，這種傾向越趨顯著。如在「光的祝祭」中充分表現個人生活快樂的近代派作家，可謂遠較粗剛勇武的古代藝術家文明的多。所以古代藝術是以國家或民族為背景放出他的光彩，近代藝術是以每個作家的優秀性放出他的光彩。</p>
<p>古代美近代美的問題，在其相對性的二大思潮中，包含着的重要意義，我們並不要急於結論。這問題的重要性是將古代美與近代美予以並立對照，而由這咎比較研究之結果，創造出可以裨益次一新時代的美的理想。我們必須發見古代通近代，近代通古代的路，而由這種古典美術和近代美術之調和中，創造出新世紀的藝術。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血401</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「是的，第一次只派出五人；傳到電話後，又加派了十人…沒有想到倒是驚動了閣下，實在抱歉！」老人第三次告罪了。</p>
<p>「電話？」鶴見表示驚異。</p>
<p>「是的，也是敝國裏的一位女同志，打電話報告的。」</p>
<p>「哦！」鶴見立時回想到了萬歲館的那個下去。</p>
<p>「那似說，我這電話是白打了呢。」鶴見增加了幾分失望，</p>
<p>「不然；」老人很肯定似的，「這倒給敝同志一個仁慈消息的機會—她在那裏，除了到館外借電話之外，館中電話，不能隨便使用—所以貴部下打電話去，我們也可聽到消息了。」</p>
<p>「老先生對於中村小姐的失踪，也有」</p>
<p>「不敢；」老人見鶴見開始轉變態度，似乎減少了幾分沉鬱；「一聽到這不幸的消息，我們已經發動了全部人力。可是到眼面前為止，還沒有得到一綫消息，唉！」</p>
<p>「很好」，鶴兒　出了隨身那本小記，把記事冊揚了一揚，微笑起來，「這上面的記載，大概已經老先生過目了。大部分是用密碼寫的，也許看不明白，至少有一部分可以看懂了。請記着：我的臨時辦事處是國際大旅社……」</p>
<p>「早已記下了」！老人也露出了一絲笑意，同時也表示不安，「不過只想知道一點關於閣下的身份和職務性質，所以冒昧了一下。可絕對沒有搜索閣下其他秘密的用意。無論如何，都得請閣下原諒，因敝團體的痛苦心境，……」　　「我很明白，也十二分同情，並且願意竭盡所有的薄力，同老先生合作」。鶴見陡然直立，握住了老人的手。</p>
<p>這是鶴見的意外收獲，也是老人的意外收獲。二人正在熱地握着手的當口，正若已經回到室內：</p>
<p>「隊長，萬歲館方面沒有消息，是倒有一個人在那裏等候隊長，堅執着要見隊長說話。國際大旅社方面，已經吩咐過了……」。</p>
<p>「很好，就請你上萬歲館辛苦一趟」，鶴見說着，立即搯出一張名牌，寫了兩句，交給正岩，「這代表我本人。請你斟酌來人情形，或是就地打發，或是帶到大旅社去見我」。</p>
<p>這時，室內的長方桌上，已經舖下酒和食品。</p>
<p>「為了表示誠意的抱歉，鄙人代表敝國，向二位敬一杯」。老人親自遞上了兩杯酒。</p>
<p>正岩乾了一杯勿勿別去。鶴見同老人密談了幾分鐘，由老人派了兩個部下，護送鶴見。</p>

<h3>甘地絕食</h3>
<p>— 阿林</p>
<p>就我記憶所及，甘地為印回衝突絕食已不止一次了，近日合眾社消息，他又將為　加拉鄉村的暴動一旦再度發生而絕食，記得在幾年前的一個次為全印獨立運動　發生衝突的絕食中，竟達二三十天之久，僅續開水果汁再延續一息，一般人都憂慮這初看起來骨瘦如柴像一點脂肪也沒有的老人會絕食而死。最後竟是一個奇蹟，這位老人終究絕食期滿而活了下來。然而已屆高年，今日生理上絕不允許他再一次絕食，怪不得消息傳來，印人增憂慮之感了。</p>
<p>從甘地，令人想到希臘的犬儒派，這苦慾主義者，是今日碩果僅存的人間道德標準了吧。他的尅制由不久前與後妻之女同床而益為表現，然而這終究是紡車時代的德行，真與他的紡車，他的觀念一樣，他的憲行是不能在現社會發生力量的。</p>
<p>甘地與印度獨立運動自不可分，然而與今日的印度，他卻有不小的距離。雖然，他的絕食與苦懲概見了他的全人格，然而這不足以濟當今之世。這所以為什麼運尼赫魯如今也祇能尊敬他而不能師承他，這隨他了。</p>
<p>一種自由的爭取，社會的革新，大概是不能祇當做觀念底地的變革行為的。對印回的衝突，自然也不會因甘地的絕食而告終止，我們願望孟加拉的暴動不成事實，不論怎樣，甘地的存在，在這世界裏還是人道與和平的象徵。</p>
<h3>阿特拉教授告別音樂會　—二十日在蘭心大戲院</h3>
<p>— 培林</p>
<p>著名小提琴專家阿特拉教授，最近要離上海返美京維也納去了。本市許多推崇他的音樂愛好者，將於本月二十日（星期日）下午五時半在蘭心大戲院聽到他最後一次的告別音樂會的機會。當晚的偉大節目，除了勃蘭姆斯的「奏鳴曲」和緬底魯遜的「競奏曲」外，包括撒遜，旗馬諾斯基，施高塔，撒拉撒第等名家的大曲。當然有一番盛大効果的。至於鋼琴伴奏，則由奧國名鋼琴家馬爾哥斯教授擔任。</p>
<p>四憶阿特拉教授遠在八年前的一九三九年，由納粹政權強壓下的維也納，逃避到上海來，經過了不少的艱難克苦，漸漸被上海的音樂界認識起來，終於被聘為上海工部局交響樂園的首席小提琴手兼任國立音樂院的小提琴主任教授。他過去常在交響樂園伴奏下，演奏過很多大競奏曲，充分表現了他技術的不凡。並且對於室內樂方面，更有特異的解釋。在此算長不長算短不短的八年當中，他的確把握了許多讚崇他的一羣聽眾，同時養成了一羣優秀的青年弟子。所以這次他突然決定回國，實在對於人材寥寥的中國音樂界，值得惋惜的一件事。我們相信這回的告別音樂會，在堪難形容的情緒下，一定可以收獲到意想不到的盛況和成功的，演奏會的門票，在蘭心大戲院，謀得利琴行同時發售。</p>
<h3>放拆息</h3>
<p>— 季水</p>
<p>據說：目前以放拆息為最得計，其實也不盡然。</p>
<p>我有位同事，他與我同姓，那時候，人家稱他為老周先生，呼我為小周，去年上半年，老周先生退伍了，領到退役金二百餘萬元，就和他的獨養子，卜居杭州，靠放拆息過日子，每個月可以收入三四十萬元，比部隊裏當連長還合算，所以因此他頗為安樂。</p>
<p>但是最近杭州友人寫信給我說：「老周先生又改行了，改跑單幫了，原因是自己要吃點煙，兒子要讀書，拆息雖然照放，收入雖然如舊，可是物價高級了；以屯貨色言，現在的二百萬元，已不及領到時的三分之一，所以老周先生慌了，趕快放棄「坐吃」的計劃，而敗行為「行吃」了</p>
<p>真的拆息雖然利厚，無如物價像大新公司裏的目標電梯，它向上滾，你向下跑，它的速度遠超過了你，你雖然跑出汗，卻還是在上面，有什麼辦法！</p>
<p>但是老周先生拆息夢已破了，待將來的單　夢又破了的時候，將又怎麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>信箱</p>
<h3>與首相兒子交朋友</h3>
<p>— 金傑</p>
<p>我是江海關港口岸警察署巡丁領班，在十三日夜奉令派在藍煙肉　　Calchas船上勤務，是日晨讀申報，知道首相子馬丁艾德里與我同船，我尋到幹事，要他與我介紹，結果咱們在他臥室會面，他是非常客氣，敬我一枝煙。他說：「你如何知道我的名字？」我便將本日的申報給她看。和馬丁共臥室的另外二個水手，　　我，見了馬丁艾總里的照像，定要這張報帶歸英國留作紀念，彼此就坐下談談。馬丁艾德里說：「每個人在年青時期，應該學習真正技能，則將來任船主，做事不難。昨天來船看我的中國記者不少，可是有幾位被船主不准給我接見，因為咱們年紀太輕了。」一直談到十一時許，他說：「下午咱們踢球，現在覺得疲倦極了。」我便拿出值班簿子請他簽名留念，他使用左手反　了他的名字，並說我希望下次再能見面，我便退出了他的臥室。我想咱們中國的青年，不該把自己身份看得太重，也應該學學馬丁艾德里學習一些專門的學術。</p>
<p>先生：我寫得太不好了，請你改正，附上他的簽字。此致自由談編輯先生台鑒</p>
<p>讀者金傑上　四月十六日</p>
<h3>罪惡的聲色</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>—從都市的流行歌曲想起</p>
<p>無論是白天或夜晚，我們經過一處鬧市，總可聽到那些流行歌曲在街頭繚繞。什麼「郎喲，郎喲！我的冤家：」什麼「快去找尋多情郎，」什麼「Oh　my　darling！愛我可是真情？」…總之，這些為人們所歌唱和歡喜的新歌，只是充滿了香艷與肉感，使人聽了飄飄然！</p>
<p>我有一個朋友打從上海過，在旅館裏住了三天。他回到鄉下去時對我說：「上海沒有什麼別的進步，只有廣告這一項卻頗發達。」</p>
<p>「這怎麼說呢？」我問。</p>
<p>「那可從這都市裏今日所表現的聲與色裏看出來。一切的聲色並不代表這都市裏的文化，只是作為一種廣告的招徠而已。」</p>
<p>一點也說得不錯，上海是沒有什麼進步的了，除了聲與色。舞場裏，商店裏，茶園裏唱的這些流行歌曲，裝的那些霓虹燈，水銀燈便是這都市裏聲與色的代表作，而這些聲色的創和與設計，也確是經了一番匠心，使這都市裏的人能落入他聲色之綱，沉醉了，永不要清醒過來！</p>
<p>聲色犬馬之樂，誰都會流連忘返的，何況喝茶，談天，嗑瓜子，聽說書之類是被譽為中國人傳統的藝術生活？然而我們要問，這種現實生活，是否便算是我們　一種文化創作？抑是否能富國強民甚至將來可以同化外族呢？如果不然末這樣歌唱下去，倖樂下去，我們又不怕有變聲失色的一天麼？</p>
<p>聲音的高昂與卑微顏色的刺激與和諧，是可以代表一個民族的生活狀況以及他的感情和思想。一支馬賽曲給法蘭西革命完成了勝利，而「毛毛雨」的進代，又不知使多少青年投江自殺了。所以成為了種藝術的生活，不是超於現實的造成一種只有私利的，忘我境界；而是肩負着時代的大　，具有着悲哀與快樂的兩重心情前進的。嚴肅工作的相對，並不就是荒淫無恥，這該是藝術家所明瞭的吧。去吧，那些靡靡的聲音！那些呌人沉醉的色澤！在這民族苦難的日子中，我們是要活在悲壯和肅穆的聲色裏，那能夠堅毅我們的人生的氣象。</p>
<h3>不變的心</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>醫生：「他的心活動得如何了」？</p>
<p>看護：「很好，很好」。</p>
<p>醫生：「怎樣樣」？</p>
<p>看護：「他已經兩次向我求愛過了」。</p>
<h3>加快速度</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>遊客（對借宿人家的司機）：「你別讓我的脫掉這班車啊」。</p>
<p>司機：「你放心好了，先生。太太說的，要是你搭不着這班車，她就要開我的差呢」。</p>
<h3>會賓樓有感　——懷念田壽昌</h3>
<p>— 林維中</p>
<p>上月十三日，那麼多朋友大為壽昌做生日，那麼多朋友和青年以及我們的親友們來參加那盛大的慶祝會，我是多麼感謝多麼高興。不過高興中間還是帶着無數的眼淚，甚至於看見在他坐認識的潘公展與唐三先生，我都沒有出去打一下招呼。俗話說：「小脚一雙，眼淚一缸」。我從民國十三年到現在，為他流的眼淚，真不知有多少缸了。</p>
<p>記得十六年前的一個秋天晚上，他用田明高，我用林慶貞的都是小時候的學名，發了一百張大紅帖子，在會賓樓請了十幾桌客，所有文化電影戲劇界的老朋友差不多都到了，嚴工上老先生說各地方言，柳亞子先生還做了詩，纔文，紅逗，胡萍女士和其他朋友唱歌的唱歌，唱戲的唱戲，總之那時候的會賓樓雖然比現在要熱鬧得多，但遠非今日可比。今日的會賓樓不要說明門面改換得油漆全新，就是人事也都變遷了。那時候是唐樓秋先生主持人，我們同去同歸；現在是洪深先生做總招待，席未散，即聽得他對壽昌說：「車子來了，老大，你同洪鎮先走」。我卻一個人，孤單單的一個人在那茫茫的黑夜裏回到我的寓所，不免思前想後。活到這麼年紀，弄得我自己都莫名其妙！</p>
<p>我時常自己問自己：什麼呌「人生」？我不過是做了一場空夢吧！</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>同年七月三日</p>
<p>樂羣社三〇六號客房的門上掛的牌子是劉先生，實際上是赤鼻子的中茶公司協理諸希農的行轅。</p>
<p>今天，這一間房的重要性簡直已不下於桂西路上的綏靖公署；從清早起，到十點鐘，已先後來了二十多起客人，還有十次以上的電話。諸老頭兒用着或軟，或硬，或客氣，或倨傲的種種不同的方式應付着，他自己也覺得格外偉大起來了。他的客人差不多全是為着商　　子來的，有的希望搭人，有的希望搭貨；除掉很少一兩個人拿着黎司令柏部長一類大闊人的信札，想用權勢硬壓之下，其餘的人都是準備下了錢，存心來挨他一下重的，只要他答應讓了們的貨或人可以上車，無論怎樣大的代價，他們都願意化。</p>
<p>諸老頭兒用手頻頻撫撲着自己那個赤紅的鼻子，真有些躊踟滿志了。</p>
<p>只是有一點使他覺得不能稱心如意的，那就是那些卡車的司機態度實在太惡劣；他已經和那個管車的陳隊長商量好，打算用一站歇一站的循環流轉的方法，把六輛卡車當十二輛甚至十八輛用，這樣　預算自己至少可以弄到一兩千　，可是那些司機好像也跟他一樣聰明，竟　此提出種種要求，使他感到應付為難。</p>
<p>他躺在牀邊的籐椅上，慢慢地喝着茶房才拿進來的第四瓶鮮橘水，眼睛望着窗外，心裏在盤算着怎樣換掉那個說話最　的司機。</p>
<p>牀上，靠裏邊，斜倚着很無聊的金　　；當老諸在和人家談　買的時候，她根本是沒有插言的機會的，想一個人走出去，又怕教老諸多疑，剩下來的一條路，就祇有靠在牀上，像泥　木塑一樣的坐着，或者偶然想想許多不相干的事。</p>
<p>壓子裏靜寂了僅僅五六分鐘，門又被一個新的來客推開了。</p>
<p>「啊！祝先生。」諸老頭兒和金愛麗幾乎同時這樣喊，金　　並且立刻　牀上站了起來，　協理的架子當然不同，祇陪着笑，運運點頭，並未親自站起來讓坐。</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 19th dispatch] The situation of the war in Shandong Province has now changed.

The National Army is still adopting a steady and solid approach, advancing into the mountainous areas with sweeping operations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 19th dispatch] In Southern Shandong and Central Shandong, the National Army has met in recent two days respectively at Cangzhuang Lake and Huandunbu between Ganyu and Tancheng, and at the western foot of the Yimeng Mountain area, and at Tang Village northeast of Zouxian.</p>

<h3>National Army Recovers Sixteen Counties in One Month; The War in Northern Shaanxi Nears its End; The "Three Treasures" No Longer Belong to the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th dispatch] In the war in Northern Shaanxi, since the National Army began its offensive on March 14th, it has recovered sixteen counties in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces in one month. These include twelve counties in Shaanxi: Fuxian, Ganquan, Yan'an, Anse, Yanyang, Yanchuan, Qingjian, Bao'an, Anding (Wabao), Hengshan, Dingbian, and Jingbian; three counties in Gansu: Qingyang, Huanxian, and Heshui; and one county in Ningxia: Yanchi. The total area of these counties is approximately 600,000 square li. The so-called "Three Treasures of the Border Region" of Mao Zedong—the Yanchang oil mines, the Yanchi salt fields, and the Gulin tobacco fields—are also no longer in their possession. The only areas where the remnants of the Communist army in Northern Shaanxi can breathe are parts of six counties: Suide, Mizhi, Jiaxian, Wubao, Shenmu, and Fugu. The war is nearing its end. Since the spring of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), when Mao Zhu and others led the remnants of the Communist army in their retreat from Jiangxi and fled into Northern Shaanxi, for thirteen years now, they have taken advantage of the Xi'an Incident and the War of Resistance against Japan to expand their army and territory, undermining unification. In Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, they have illegally occupied twenty-two counties (eighteen in Northern Shaanxi, one in Ningxia, and three in Eastern Gansu). Nearby areas have also been harassed by them from time to time. This time, the National Army launched a campaign to quell the rebellion, advancing steadily and solidly, pursuing and suppressing on one hand and pacifying on the other. The complete pacification should not be far off.</p>

Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Jun attended. Secretary-General Shao explained that the temporary meeting was convened at the proposal of five senators, including Wang Puhan.

Chairman Chiang specially designated Zhang Lisheng to come to the meeting today to explain. After finishing his speech, he asked Zhang Lisheng to report on the process of the government and various parties agreeing on the guiding principles of governance. Zhang first stated that he regretted that he had not been able to submit the guiding principles for discussion before they were announced, representing the government, and specifically stated that it was not the government's intention to ignore the status and authority of the Political Consultative Conference.

Zhang believed that the guiding principles were similar to the 36th year governing principles previously announced by the government in some respects, and more specific in some respects, such as the provisions for the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and local administration, which are based on the spirit of the Constitution, and hoped that all senators would support the government's measures to overcome the current difficulties.

<p>The First Batch of Japanese Reparations Obtained by Me to be Shipped Starting in Early June; Preliminary Results Obtained on Transportation Issues</p>
<p>[This City Report] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei specially telegraphed representatives of the shipping industry union in this city, Li Yunliang, Hu Shiyuan, Cheng Yuqi, Dong Haoyun, Zhong Shandao, and others, to Nanjing some days ago for consultations and instructions. The representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing their public duties. It is reported that after Minister Yu consulted with the representatives, he convened a transportation preparation meeting at the International Club at noon on the 18th, chaired by Vice Ministers of Transportation Tan Boyu and Ling Hongdong, and Director of the Navigation Administration Department Li Jinglu. In addition to representatives of the shipping industry, the attendees included Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, Director of the Japanese Reparations Committee Xue Zue, and various committee members, directors of various departments of the Ministry of Transportation stationed in Japan, and others. After a three-hour meeting, preliminary results were obtained on the transportation of reparations materials. It is learned that the first batch of reparations materials totals approximately 600,000 tons, mostly factories, machinery, including heavy industry and chemical industry equipment, and a floating dock, which is planned to be located in Wusong in this city to establish a central shipyard. The unloading of these reparations materials will be supervised on-site by personnel from the Resources Committee, the Ministry of National Defense, and other relevant agencies. Transportation matters will be managed by the Ministry of Transportation, which will organize a transportation committee to handle the priority procedures and various detailed methods. Ships will be dispatched by the Civil Aviation Maritime Transport United Operations Office and the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to jointly take responsibility for transportation, using chartering methods to ensure simplicity. After preparations are completed in the short term, representatives will be sent to Japan to inspect and deploy everything on-site, with shipping scheduled to begin in early June.</p>
<p>It is Rumored that Japanese Reparations Do Not Include Textile Machines</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Reporters learned from authoritative sources that the 30% interim reparations from Japan, which Washington ordered to be moved as soon as possible, do not include electric textile machines. Other reliable sources further predicted that even in the final reparations plan, Japan's textile industry would not be touched. However, the report has not yet been confirmed. If this report is true, it would be tantamount to accepting Strick's reparations plan. Regarding Japan's textile industry, Strick, who led the reparations investigation committee to Japan two months ago, told the local community upon arriving in Japan: "We do not advocate reducing Japan's textile industry." If the Japanese reparations plan does not include the textile industry (or reduces reparations in the textile industry), it would be a major blow to countries with underdeveloped heavy industries. These countries (including China and the Philippines) will likely feel fierce competition from Japan's future textile industry, as Japan's textiles will be exported to Sweden, the Dutch East Indies, the United States, Hong Kong, and various parts of Southeast Asia. The fact that Japanese reparations do not include the textile industry is an even greater blow to China and the Philippines, as the textile industries of both countries were destroyed during the Middle East occupation. Even the US textile industry feels threatened by Japan's textile industry. According to reports, the Allied policy of abolishing Japan's heavy industry and concentrating Japan's future economy on so-called light industry has caused increasing anxiety among people in the US textile industry.</p>

<h3>Philippines Refuses Re-Entry of 7,600 Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 19th] Regarding the request from Gaines, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the Philippines, to allow 7,600 Overseas Chinese who were deported from the Philippines in 1945 to re-enter the Philippines, Commissioner Valbuena of the Immigration Bureau recently submitted a memorandum to the Philippine government rejecting the request. The reasons given were: the deadline for the re-entry of the 7,600 Overseas Chinese has expired, so they no longer have the right to re-enter. Moreover, given the current housing, food, and unemployment situation in the Philippines, it is not appropriate to allow them to enter. The Immigration Bureau is aware of the current friendly relations between China and the Philippines, but during this period of Philippine reconstruction, normal procedures must be followed for the entry of foreigners to avoid exacerbating social and economic problems in the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Founding Congress of the National Banking Federation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Federation of Bank and Commercial Associations of the Republic of China issued the following declaration of establishment:</p>
<p>The Federation formally held its founding congress in the capital on April 15, 1947. Members from 35 bank and commercial associations from all over the country attended, representing 9,600 people. They traveled through difficulties and participated enthusiastically. After four days of meetings, 155 proposals were made. Retrospectively, although the Federation of Banking Associations was founded in 1920, it was reported in 1924 that it met once a year for five years. However, it has never been as extensive and profound as today's congress. This is an unprecedented event in China's financial industry and is sufficient to open a glorious page in China's economic history. During this congress, the representatives from all over the country showed a spirit of sincere unity and harmonious consultation, which is not only admired by our colleagues in the financial industry, but also sufficient to prompt the people of the whole country to pay serious attention. The far-reaching significance and great future of this are beyond words. Our country's bank and commercial associations have 35 units, representing 96 people, traveling through difficulties and participating enthusiastically. After four days of meetings, 155 proposals were made. Looking back, although the Federation of Banking Associations was founded in 1920, it was reported in 1924 that it met once a year for five years. However, it has never been as extensive and profound as today's congress. This is indeed an unprecedented event in China's financial industry and is sufficient to open a glorious page in China's economic history. During this congress, the representatives from all over the country showed a spirit of sincere unity and harmonious consultation, which is not only inspiring to our colleagues in the financial industry, but also sufficient to prompt the people of the whole country to pay serious attention. The far-reaching significance and great future of this are beyond words. Our country's banking industry has a history of 50 years since its inception. In these 50 years, the political and economic situation has been turbulent, and our industry has been fighting against a difficult environment every day. Finally, we have been able to overcome difficulties and achieve a rough scale, and have been able to make slight contributions to the promotion of national construction and the development of social economy. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, our industry followed the national policy under the leadership of the government, and spared no effort to assist the national finances and adjust the financing of all industries. This is especially gratifying and can be reported to the public. Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this association, we must carry on the past and open up the future. What we must do to assist the government in implementing economic reform plans, guiding industry and commerce, and increasing production in order to achieve the goal of national rejuvenation and construction is what our banking industry seeks day and night, and it is also the greatest goal of the establishment of this association. However, there are things that must be told to our public: China's economic crisis has reached its extreme. Production is in chaos, trade is stagnant, finances are overstretched, and inflation is rampant. The entire financial system has not been established, and banking regulations are heavily restricted. The relationship between the banking industry and the social economy is inseparable. Under such economic and financial conditions, it is difficult to expect the development of the banking industry. Since the military uprising, the economy has been abnormal, prices have risen daily, and the value of currency has fallen daily. Funds are concentrated in speculative markets, and production funds are often insufficient and have to resort to usury, resulting in high black market interest rates. Banks want to absorb capital at low interest rates and use it for legitimate purposes, but cannot. Banks are originally centers of capital. Today, social floating capital cannot be concentrated in banks, and with the depreciation of currency, the capital strength of banks is far from comparable to before the war. Whenever social floating capital is rampant and major fluctuations occur in the market, it is not something that general banks can control or be responsible for. However, wanting to rely solely on the capital strength of general banks to assist in the recovery and construction of the domestic economy is inevitable. Therefore, what this association wants to suggest to the government and financial authorities, and what it hopes from our solid industry, summarizes the opinions of representatives from all over the country, and there are several points:</p>
<p>(1) Balance Finances and Stabilize Currency Value: The relationship between currency value and the banking industry is most important. Only a stable currency system can make people have the psychology of storing, and our banks can give play to their function of concentrating and using social funds. However, to seek a stable currency value, we must first stop inflation, and to stop inflation, we must balance finances first. We are willing to cooperate with the government and the people of the whole country to promote its realization.</p>
<p>(2) Improve Financial Institutions and Establish a Banking System: The industrial and commercial financial system and the agricultural financial system must be established. In the industrial and commercial financial system, we especially hope to actively strengthen the effectiveness of the central bank, implement the task of "bank of banks," universally handle key loans and rediscounts, participate in the open market, and all funds that benefit industry and commerce, whether long-term investment or short-term use, should be passed through general banks as much as possible and reach the path of production, so that there can be full development. The adjustment of the deposit reserves of general banks should be based on the urgency and strive for flexibility to achieve stability. As for the distribution of the financial network, the branch system should be adopted, and the implementation of financial policies should adopt the regional management system. In the agricultural financial system, short-term funds should be distinguished, and strong central institutions should be established to handle land mortgages, promote low-interest agricultural loans, promote the rediscounting of agricultural bills and the rediscounting of agricultural products, and promote credit cooperation and agricultural insurance, which are all important current tasks.</p>
<p>(3) Remove Passive Controls and Engage in Active Guidance: The current methods of regulating banks mainly include the "Provisional Measures for the Financial Department to Manage Banks" promulgated in March 1946 and the "Measures to Strengthen the Management of Financial Business" promulgated in February this year. Among them, there are many restrictions on the scope of banking business, the use of funds, and the establishment of branches, which make banks have the feeling of moving with difficulty. Not only does it hinder the operation of banks, but it also affects the development of the industry. The government should remove various regulatory laws, remove them as much as possible, to benefit finance and facilitate the development of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>(4) Promulgate a New Banking Law and Establish a Permanent Scale: The draft of the new banking law has been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan several times. The suggestions of the former Shanghai Banking Association have been adopted in many places. However, the revised draft still has many rigid provisions. In order to make the fundamental law smoothly implemented, we must set up more flexible articles, mainly with active guidance as the purpose. We deeply hope that the government will give this association the opportunity to contribute its opinions again before formal formulation.</p>
<p>(5) Promote Inter-Industry Joint Discussions to Replenish Production Funds: Our banking industry colleagues should also strive for self-discipline, increase communication and cooperation among colleagues, and strive to increase production, promote investment and loans, and coordinate with the national economic construction plan.</p>
<p>(6) Promote Banking Academics and Standardize Systems and Procedures: The progress of foreign banking business is due to the progress of banking academics. The promotion of banking academics in our country cannot be delayed. If we want to develop banking business, we must first rectify the lives of colleagues and arouse the interest in research. Other standardization, such as accounting systems and contract documents, should also be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(7) Seek Cooperation from All Industries and Win Social Sympathy: If we want to make banks give their greatest effect, we must rely on social economic activities. The operation of industry, commerce, and various industries is closely related to banking business. For example, the production, transportation, and sales of industry and commerce, their specific plans, and detailed reports are valuable guidelines and necessary references for the banking industry. And the social people can give more cooperation to stabilize the market, and that is more benefit to finance.</p>
<p>In short, what this association seeks from the government and financial authorities is nothing more than to establish national credit, strengthen financial institutions, fulfill the function of regulating funds, and guide banks to a proper outlet. And our banking colleagues, even in this difficult situation, should still uphold their previous spirit, support national policies, and cooperate to promote them. No matter whether the environment is favorable or unfavorable, or the size of the achievements, we must make the greatest efforts to develop the economy, stabilize the people's livelihood, and complete the mission that we should bear. Then, what our colleagues are working hard for today will have good results and be shown to the society. This is what this association sincerely hopes, and hopes that all sectors of society will give deep sympathy and cooperation. Adversity inspires sagacity, and difficulties rejuvenate the country. If we can move forward along this path, then the development of China's economy and finance will have a bright and promising day, and the future of our country and nation will rely on it. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issue of Issuing 10,000 Yuan Notes</h3>
<p>Recently, due to rising prices, the amount of paper money needed for transactions has also increased. As a result, cash transactions in the market have become very inconvenient. All banks, firms, and manufacturers have had to hire extra staff to specifically count money. Ordinary citizens also find it very troublesome. Moreover, due to the inconvenience of counting, people are too lazy to count, leading to many disputes. A few unscrupulous individuals deliberately mix in small denomination notes to seek illegal gains, deceiving each other and greatly affecting trust. Recently, the Federation of Banking Associations held its first general meeting in Nanjing. It specifically resolved to request the Central Bank to issue 10,000-yuan notes, which is undoubtedly a resolution that meets the needs of society.</p>
<p>The reason why the Central Bank has not issued 10,000-yuan notes and is unwilling to issue more 500-yuan customs gold notes is simply because when customs gold notes were issued, speculators spread rumors saying that it would stimulate prices, taking the opportunity to raise prices. Therefore, the Central Bank has some concerns. In fact, since the start of the war, prices have been rising steadily. At that time, there were no 10,000-yuan notes, or even 5,000-yuan notes, but general prices did not stabilize as a result. Although there are many reasons for rising prices, the main points are nothing more than a shortage of materials and currency inflation. Increasing the denomination of notes can certainly contribute to currency inflation, but currency inflation does not necessarily require raising the denomination of notes. In other words, even if the denomination of notes is small, if the issuance is increased, the currency can still inflate. Conversely, if the issuance is appropriate and not excessive, even if the denomination of notes is high, it may not necessarily lead to inflation, and consequently, general prices may not necessarily be driven up. It can be seen that prices and note denominations are actually two separate things and should not be confused.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the Federation of Banking Associations, a representative from Guangdong said that remittances from overseas Chinese all have to be sent to the interior, but the local areas are not peaceful, and it is not easy to transport banknotes, resulting in a significant reduction in remittances from overseas Chinese. He also said that currently, the discount on banknotes on the street is as high as nine yuan per hundred yuan. If the Central Bank does not issue large denomination notes, remittances from overseas Chinese will inevitably disappear due to the inability to make payments. The severity of the situation has reached this point!</p>
<p>Therefore, the request of the Federation of Banking Associations is based on actual needs. Originally, currency is a medium of exchange. Now, with high prices and a larger base, the medium needed will naturally have to increase correspondingly. For example, before the war, the price of rice was only about ten yuan, but now it has risen to 160,000 or 170,000. Fortunately, the face value of ordinary legal tender notes is mostly one or two thousand yuan. Although a dozen stacks of banknotes may not be able to be fully counted, they can still barely cope. If we still used five-yuan or ten-yuan notes as before the war, imagine how cumbersome it would be in practice! I am afraid that many transactions would become impossible due to the difficulty of payment.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to stabilize prices, rather than restricting the denomination of notes and not allowing it to increase, it is more practical and effective to limit the amount of issuance. Moreover, the 500-yuan denomination customs gold note is practically equivalent to a 10,000-yuan note. The issuance and circulation of 10,000-yuan notes can be said to have become a reality, not a true innovation. Therefore, our requirements are: (1) After the new 10,000-yuan notes are issued, small denomination notes should be withdrawn and destroyed as much as possible to reduce the difficulty of accepting and giving them; (2) Pay attention to the regional supply and demand situation, and do not focus too much on a few places with excessive hot money, which would deepen the degree of inflation; (3) Use the issuance of 10,000-yuan notes as a means to facilitate circulation and reduce small denomination notes, and do not regard it as a shortcut to make up for the deficit in public finances.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the issuance of banknotes and public finances have long been intertwined, and the third point mentioned above may inevitably be close to ideal. This kind of concern is indeed worth paying attention to. However, increasing the amount of issuance does not necessarily have to be done through 10,000-yuan notes. That is to say, even if 10,000-yuan notes are not issued, it does not necessarily mean that currency inflation will stop, or that currency inflation can be prevented. Moreover, the suggestion to issue 10,000-yuan notes still comes from the National Federation of Banking Associations. Its motivation is of course in the currency itself, and there is absolutely no financial meaning in it. According to the authorities, it will indeed be issued in the short term. But it is also for the sake of flexible transactions and meeting needs. Therefore, judging the matter on its merits, we always believe that the issuance of 10,000-yuan notes meets the current needs.</p>

<h3>Austrian Border Issue Submitted for Discussion, Foreign Ministers' Conference Faces Another Test, Definition of German Assets in Austria Still Undetermined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 19th (Radio): U.S. Secretary of State Marshall requested this evening to discuss the Austrian border issue, and the four foreign ministers have agreed. This issue includes Yugoslavia's claim to southern Carinthia, which the Soviet Union has expressed support for, while the Western powers have expressed opposition. If this issue cannot be resolved, the Austrian peace treaty will inevitably be shelved. Although Marshall and Bevin have not officially announced the end of the conference, considering that there is no hope of reaching an agreement on both the German and Austrian peace treaties, they are eager to return home early. Marshall's proposal today is probably to make another test to prove that unless one party's policy is completely changed, the conference cannot make progress. Although there was slight progress on some issues as a result of the two-hour meeting, there was no achievement of any value.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] The four foreign ministers discussed the issue of German assets in Austrian territory in the Austrian treaty today, and their opinions have not approached, so it is expected that the Austrian peace treaty cannot be completed or signed at the Moscow conference. Marshall tried to establish a compromise, but was rejected by Molotov. Marshall then stated, "Judging from Mr. Molotov's opinion, Austria does not seem to be able to obtain freedom and independence, and its economy and exports seem to be subject to foreign control. I feel that our opinions are getting further and further apart. If Molotov's proposal regarding German assets is accepted, Austria will become a puppet state under foreign rule, and the United States will never sign a treaty that creates such a state." Bevin and Bidault both expressed their willingness to accept Marshall's compromise proposal regarding German assets in Austria. Bevin also recognized that the primary task is to determine the definition of German assets in Austria. Bevin said that no one denies that the Soviet Union has the right to obtain compensation from German assets, but judging from the system proposed by Molotov, the property accepted by the Soviet Union could allow the Soviet Union to control Austria's financial interests. If all factories, land, and forests that can be transferred according to Molotov's plan are considered to be detached from Austria's economy, then Austria's economy may have no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Marshall's compromise proposal on Article 35 of the Austrian Treaty regarding German assets is intended to establish an agreement on this issue so that the Austrian treaty can be completed at this Moscow conference. The content of Marshall's proposal is as follows: (1) Austria should recognize that the four powers have the right to dispose of German assets in Austria in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding German reparations, and Austria should take all necessary measures to facilitate the transfer of these assets to the four powers; (2) The definition of German assets is the property rights or interests enjoyed by the German government or German people before May 8, 1945, and these property rights or interests were acquired by the German government or people on March 12, 1938, or acquired by the German government or people after March 12, 1938, without violence or coercion; (3) After the aforementioned assets are transferred to the four powers, they should still be governed by Austrian law, but the Austrian government will not nationalize them within a certain period after the peace treaty comes into effect; (4) The eastern region of Austria referred to in the Potsdam Agreement refers to the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria and the Soviet zone of Vienna. Marshall believes that after the definition of German assets is determined, the disposal of these assets can be carried out immediately. After an understanding of this definition is established, each government of the four powers shall take necessary measures to immediately order the Austrian government to formally transfer these assets in the eastern region of Austria to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Although the Foreign Ministers' Conference is in a Stalemate, There is Still Hope for an Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 19th] Marshal Stalin recently met with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall. Today, according to well-informed sources on the scope of their talks, although the current four foreign ministers' conference is in a stalemate, it should not be regarded as there being no hope for a future agreement on the German peace treaty. The talks between Stalin and the foreign ministers Bevin and Bidault have been made more forceful by the Stalin-Marshall meeting. Both were able to show statesmanship and contribute to promoting understanding among the nations of the world. Time is important, and we all need time. Although the future seems bleak at the moment, there is no need to be pessimistic. A solution will eventually be found, or development may still require one or two more meetings. The Kremlin has not expressed pessimism about the possibility of reaching an agreement and the future of American foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Intensify Economic Unification in the German Occupation Zone</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 19th (Radio): It is reported that after the four-power conference reached a stalemate, Britain and the United States will intensify their efforts to promote the effective merger of the British and American occupation zones. Britain and the United States hope that France will join in the effort to unify the three western occupation zones of Germany economically, but the prospect of France's participation is slim. Due to issues such as the Ruhr and the Rhineland, France disagrees with Britain and the United States, so the merger of the three occupation zones may be difficult to achieve.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office Receives Protest from Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The British Foreign Office officially announced today that it has received a note from the Yugoslav government, which is strongly worded and accuses the British occupation forces of carrying out terrorist activities against the Slovenian people in the southern Carinthia province of Austria, and lists various examples. Officials here have expressed doubt about these accusations, but have decided to investigate them.</p>
<h3>Austrian Cabinet Prime Minister to Go to Moscow</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 18th] Officials have recently announced that Austrian Cabinet Prime Minister Figl will depart for Moscow on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Liu Kai Discusses the Trusteeship System, Says Its Basic Goals Are Consistent with China's National Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Kai (currently the Chinese representative to the United Nations Trusteeship Council) said in a solo interview with a Central News Agency reporter today that China believes the work of the Trusteeship Council is extremely important, as its work includes enabling millions of people in non-self-governing territories to achieve political, economic, and social progress. Liu pointed out that the basic goals of the trusteeship system are fully in line with the principles of Sun Yat-sen, the father of China, and the guiding policies of the Chinese government. The progress of the peoples in the trust territories has a significant impact on other non-independent peoples around the world. When asked by the reporter to review the work of the Council since March 26, he replied: Although the administering countries pay attention to maintaining their power in each territory and fear the inappropriate interference of the Council, the representatives of the Council have gradually developed a spirit of shared goals, and the boundary between the administering countries and the non-administering countries is not as clear as it was earlier. Liu believes that there is currently an encouraging sign that each representative is gradually realizing that they are responsible for a job, which is to pay attention to the welfare of the peoples of the trust territories. Liu discussed the future of the Council, saying that the success of the Council depends on the cooperation between the representatives of the administering countries and the non-administering countries, and also requires the support of public opinion. The reporter asked about the Council's rules of procedure for handling submissions and applications to the Council, which have always been a major concern for the Council. Liu said: The rules of procedure regarding applications have been drafted on the basis of fairness and freedom. Liu said that the Council has so far been engaged in drafting rules of procedure, and he said that this preliminary work is extremely important, as the entire development of the trusteeship system is bound by these regulations.</p>
<h3>Security Council Passes Fact-Finding Mission to Remain in Greece, Soviet Proposal Rejected, U.S. Aid Plan to Greece Wins an Important Victory</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] The Security Council rejected the Soviet resolution on the 18th, which authorized the United Nations to supervise U.S. aid to Greece. This is a major victory for the United States and an endorsement by the Security Council of Truman's proposal to aid Turkey and Greece. Earlier, the Security Council also rejected Poland's proposal to prohibit U.S. aid to Greece as a "political weapon," which was intended as an amendment to the Soviet resolution, but also advocated authorizing the United Nations to supervise the U.S. aid plan. The United Nations then decided to establish a permanent Balkan commission to monitor cross-border and other disputes. This was proposed by the United States and consists of eleven Security Council representatives. However, Soviet representative Gromyko strongly opposed it and stated that he would use his veto power during the vote. As a result, it was passed by a vote of nine to zero. The Soviet Union and Poland refused to vote. At this point, Gromyko demanded that the debate on his resolution to authorize the United Nations to supervise U.S. aid to Greece be expedited. The U.S. side immediately stated that it would not need to use its veto power to oppose the Soviet proposal, as there were already enough countries opposing the Soviet proposal, so there was no need for the United States to use its veto power. It is also learned that the United Nations Balkan Fact-Finding Commission in Geneva is currently drafting a report on the facts of the Greek border dispute. According to the secretary of the commission, Colonel Lant, a certain document related to the investigation has gone missing.</p>
<h3>Churchill Criticizes Government, Calls Wallace a Communist</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Britain's wartime Prime Minister Churchill spoke at a rally of Conservative supporters here today, saying that Britain is being led into bankruptcy, the empire has been forfeited, and India has been shamelessly abandoned. He criticized the government's fiscal policy, saying that the Socialist government is surviving solely on the alms of the United States, but the loans obtained from the United States are being wasted and abused. These loans should only be used to revive Britain's postwar industry, which would be reasonable. Regarding Wallace's recent visit to Britain, Churchill called Wallace a Communist and lacked the courage to explain his goals. Churchill said he could not tolerate those who used the hospitality of friendly countries to slander their own country. He believes that policy toward the Soviet Union should be based on strength, and establish honorable friendship, and should never be appeased to show weakness. In diplomacy, Britain should make it clear that it will never allow the relationship between Britain and the United States to be alienated, and Britain will never participate in any action that hinders the unity of English-speaking nations.</p>
<h3>Wallace Criticizes Warmongers Again in Speech in Sweden</h3>
<p>[United Press, Stockholm, 18th] Wallace said in a public meeting at the University of Stockholm here today that the people of the United States and the Soviet Union are both in dire need of peace, but unfortunately they are inflamed by propaganda. There are now a large number of people who believe that the world is still divided into three, with capitalism, socialism, and communism each occupying one side, so we must engage in war; these radicals are criminals against the welfare of all mankind.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Regarding the invitation from the Greek left-wing united front to Wallace to visit Greece, it is learned that Wallace has declined and said that he will return home in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Sets Japanese Industrial and Agricultural Production Levels</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] The Far Eastern Commission recently announced that it has instructed MacArthur to immediately determine Japanese industrial and agricultural production levels in accordance with the levels of Japanese industry and agriculture in 1930 and 1934. The Commission believes that these levels are sufficient to supply Japan's peacetime needs until 1950. Some heavy industries will be reduced to the levels of 1930-34, but other important peacetime production will be raised, because the living standards of 1930-34 must be maintained.</p>
<h3>The United States is Studying the Details of the Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson said at a press conference that the United States is continuing to study the detailed agenda of the peace treaty with Japan, and has been doing so for a long time, but it is only being studied by the State Department, and has not yet been done in conjunction with other governments. The date of convening the peace conference has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>U.S. Interior Secretary Krug Advocates Statehood for Alaska, Most Members of Congress Express Approval</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Interior Secretary Krug argued before a House subcommittee today that Alaska is crucial to U.S. national defense and is a key hub for future trade with Asia, advocating that the territory be made a state. It is said that Alaska's defense status is well known. We must develop its agriculture, industry, commerce, and various professions to support the defense plans of the army and navy. The great circle air route from San Francisco via the Aleutian Islands to Japan is about 1,700 miles shorter than the old route via the Hawaiian Islands, and the former may become the main air route to Japan and China. Many members of Congress agree with Alaska's statehood, but say that the United States should not rush to build proper defenses in Alaska.</p>
<h3>Hoover Reports to Senate Foreign Relations Committee that World Food Shortage Remains Serious, Relief Fund Expected to Be Approved Quickly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee secretly heard relief expert Hoover report today that the world will face a greater food crisis next year, it has prepared to take action on the $350 million relief fund to provide relief to China and five European countries on the 22nd of this month. After Hoover finished reporting on the food situation in Europe to the committee, he told the press that the current world food shortage situation will be more serious next year, because Europe first encountered severe cold, then suffered floods, and the Allied countries dismantled the Axis powers' armaments industries, which destroyed factories that could be used to produce fertilizer.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Councillors Election Scheduled to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>Conservatives Expected to Win</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Japanese voters will elect 250 members of the House of Councillors tomorrow. Left-wing candidates will work hard to compete, attempting to break the majority held by the Conservative Party, but considering that the Conservative Party won a great victory in the recent local elections, it will still be able to maintain a majority in this House of Councillors election. According to the new constitution, the House of Councillors is the upper house of the Japanese parliament, and its function is to maintain a check on the House of Representatives. Members of the House of Representatives are scheduled to be elected on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>Eight-Nation Rice Conference to Be Held in India Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] It is reported that the main rice-producing and rice-consuming countries will hold a conference in Travancore, southern India, on May 15, and the countries invited by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to participate in the conference are China, France (representing Vietnam), India, the Netherlands (representing Java and the East Indies), the United States (representing Japan and Korea), Britain (representing Burma, Ceylon, Malaya), Siam, and the Philippines.

<h3>Widespread Sales, Large-Scale Counterfeit Drug Organization Cracked, Number of Deaths from Past Two Years Unknown, Main Culprit Arrested, Large Quantity of Raw Materials Seized</h3>
<p>Recently, the market has been flooded with counterfeit drugs, which has greatly affected the health of citizens. The authorities are paying close attention to this. Recently, Zhang Hanguang, the chief of the Third Inspection Division of the Garrison Command Inspection Office, received a tip and ordered investigators Shang Wu, Zhou Ji, and Zhang Linxiang to investigate. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at six o'clock, on the pretext of buying medicine, they obtained evidence of counterfeit drugs, and arrested the main culprit Gao Qilong at 400 Weihaiwei Road, and Zhang Liangzhu, who was solely responsible for the sales of counterfeit drugs, at the cross-street building of Yongkangli, Chengdu Road. More than ten large boxes of counterfeit drugs that had already been packaged and their raw materials were seized from the two locations. Among them, aspirin, 606, and Ren Dan accounted for the majority. According to confessions, the main counterfeit drug manufacturing organization is said to be in Suzhou. It has been operating for more than two years. The Suzhou side is responsible for manufacturing the drugs, and the Shanghai side is responsible for packaging and sales. The counterfeit drugs include aspirin produced by Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, Dumartin (morphine injection), Cadang, Neo-Salvarsan, Black Lion 606, Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory's Tianlin, Ke Fa Drugstore's Wakulin, Takeda Pharmaceutical Factory's skin disease medicinal liquor Ertu-fu, Red Granule Ren Dan, and more than a dozen other kinds. The counterfeit drug packaging and printing are almost indistinguishable from the real ones. For two years, they have been sold extensively along the Beijing-Shanghai line in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and as far as Beiping, Tianjin, and the northeastern provinces in North China. According to their own claims, some people have gone blind after using the counterfeit Wakulin eye drops, and some patients have died immediately after using the Dumartin morphine injection. The other counterfeit drugs also have no medicinal ingredients. Recently, they even planned to expand the scale and manufacture them in large quantities. Therefore, if this were not cracked, the consequences would be even more unimaginable. All the suspects were transferred to the Inspection Office for interrogation yesterday, and their accomplices are being strictly pursued (the image below shows the two culprits Gao and Zhang and the seized counterfeit China News Agency)</p>
<h3>Ninth Resolution of the Operations and Capital Assessment Committee: Employees Should Receive Differential Subsidies Regardless of Peak or Off-Peak Season</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Labor-Capital Assessment Committee held its ninth meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the conference room of the Bureau of Social Affairs. Attendees included Cha Liangjian, Qian Naixin, Shui Xiangyun (representing the Zhang Zhu San Dynasty), Zhao Zengjue (representing Shen Baoquan), Tan Yulin, Wu YunChu, Zhang Wei, Dong Renguan, Xiao Zongjun, and Xuan Tiewu (representing Huang Dongsheng). Zhou Xuexiang and others were present as observers. Wu Kaixian served as chairman. The resolution supplemented the detailed rules for differential subsidy payments: (1) Employees should receive differential subsidies regardless of whether they have peak or off-peak months, but for workers with high mobility, the differential subsidies should be issued based on the number of working days, following the piecework method.</p>
<p>Supplementary Measures for Children's Differential Pay</p>
<p>(Children Workers: (A) Including those providing meals, such as apprentices, learners, and trainees, previously resolved to receive only cotton cloth and sugar, the quantity of which should also be calculated at one-third. (B) Differential amounts for trainees in various industries can be handled by analogy with the children worker method, but those whose work and compensation are the same as ordinary workers should not be regarded as equal to children workers, and their differential pay should not be reduced. (3) Shutdown: During the temporary shutdown period of each factory, those who receive maintenance fees according to the method of this committee shall handle the differential pay in the same way as wages. (4) Meals: (A) For those who have been provided meals by capital or have customarily deducted meal expenses to calculate base salaries, one-third of the rice, oil, salt, and coal in their differential pay is allowed to be deducted. (B) For those whose meals have been provided free of charge by the capital, the full amount of the differential pay shall be issued. (5) The differential pay for temporary workers may be issued based on the number of working days.</p>

<h3>The Seymour Road Fire Case</h3>
<p>Verdict on the 26th</p>
<p>The Parts of Robbery, Public Danger, and Theft Were Concluded Simultaneously Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The court yesterday opened a court session to hear the case of the Seymour Road fire, in which 23 firefighters were suspected of committing robbery, public danger, theft, and other crimes, and the verdict will be announced on the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Meier and Tuo first conducted a pre-trial hearing on Shang Zhikui, Li Chengjun, Dai Guangrong, Cai Zhiying, and other four defendants on charges of robbery. The statements of the four people were not much different from before. According to Wan Shengjun, a staff member of the first section of the fire department, who was a witness: I went to inspect with the section chief when the fire was spreading, and the boxes of items had been pressed under the collapsed wall and did not seem to have been moved. The defendant's defense lawyers unanimously criticized the prosecutor, believing that it was inappropriate to cite the provisions of the Regulations on the Punishment of Robbery.</p>
<p>Summoning Multiple Witnesses</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the hearing continued on the charges of public danger and theft against Huang Baoqi, Li Xuan, Zhu Qinglan, and other nineteen people (including Zhou Yuehuan who had died of illness), and the court summoned Godman, the captain of the American fire brigade, Jukefu, the station chief of the American military camp on Xinzha Road, Wang Wentao, the section chief of the first section of the fire department, Song Zhipeng, a military police officer, and many others as witnesses. According to Godman: I arrived at the fire scene at 12:10 AM on the day of the fire and saw more than a dozen firefighters watching from the side. As for whether they were taking turns resting, I don't know. For the convenience of firefighting, I broke the glass on the window with a gun, but I don't know why the Chinese firefighters did not break the window and pierce the roof to rescue. Jukefu said: I am only responsible for protecting the American military camp and I am not very clear about the situation during the firefighting. Song Zhipeng, a military police officer from the 23rd regiment, said: I saw some firefighters talking and laughing in the tailor shop across the street, and I also saw firefighters eating candy at the fire scene. He also said that there were things being taken, but he could not specifically point out who it was.</p>
<p>Denying Allowing It to Spread</p>
<p>The defendant Huang Baoqi stated: When the No. 30 car faucet entered the No. 29 garden, the smoke was very thick. In order to avoid touching the electric wires, I borrowed a fluorescent light for use. Later, I could not find the original owner to return it, so I temporarily kept it in the team. Zhu Qinglan and Li Xun both said that they tried their best to fight the fire and did not allow it to spread. The other defendants also denied stealing property. Later, Wang Wentao, the section chief of the fire department, was summoned as a witness to inquire about the cause of the fire and who was responsible for it. It is said that there was a wooden overpass in the alley connecting to No. 29, which was the biggest reason for the fire to lead to No. 29. The firefighters did try to tie the roof to fight the fire, but because the roofs of these houses were all covered with lead sheets, they could not be pierced. Since the fire could not rise, it spread everywhere, causing a major disaster. According to my observation, the firefighters were not at fault. The weather, the wind, and the unreasonable construction were the biggest reasons. Finally, the court ordered that Huang Shiqi, who was in custody, was allowed to pay a written guarantee of 20 million yuan, and the rest were handed over to the original guarantor, and the witnesses were ordered to return.</p>

<h3>Subsidized Housing</h3>
<p>Can Still Be Renewed</p>

<h3>Police Officer Injured Soldier Conflict Resolved</h3>
<p>Determining Responsibility and Ordering Separate Handling</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The conflict between police officers and injured soldiers that occurred at Pingliang Road, Meizhou Road, Yangshupu on the afternoon of the 6th of this month has been satisfactorily resolved after the Songhu Garrison Command sent personnel to investigate and handled it carefully with a fair attitude. The handling process and the telex from Commander Xuan to the 20th Rear Hospital of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, the Municipal Police Bureau, and the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police are recorded below; (1) Wang, Director of the 20th Rear Hospital: After investigation by our headquarters, the incident of the conflict between the custodian and the injured soldiers has been clarified and handled separately. In addition to the police officers who have ordered the police bureau to handle the dereliction of duty, and the medical expenses for the injured soldier Zhao Xingchang are allocated by our headquarters, it is also wrong for the injured soldiers to gather crowds to gamble, commit violence, and beat people. You should order the following to be handled: (1) Investigate and identify the ringleader who led the crowd to destroy the police station and the patrol pavilion and send him to the Department for handling according to law. (2) The accomplices of gambling and violence shall be punished separately by the court. (3) One pistol taken from the police officer must be investigated and handed over to the Department for return. In the future, you should strictly manage it to maintain discipline. Please report the handling situation as necessary. (2) Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau: It is known that the case has been investigated and clarified by our newspaper, and handled separately. In addition to the injured soldiers, another telegram will be sent to the 20th Rear Hospital for handling. Regarding the police officers, although banning gambling and implementing security is within the scope of their duties, according to the security situation at the time, it was not necessary to fire a gun to the extent necessary, but they hastily shot, causing stray bullets to injure people, and their defense was excessive, which is also undeniable, and should be discussed separately as follows: (1) Police officer Chen Lifang, No. 855, should be punished for shooting and injuring people due to excessive defense. (2) The police officer who fired the gun on Meizhou Road, and the commanding officer in charge at the time, were incompetent in commanding, and the chief of the police branch in charge failed to quell the chaos immediately, causing the incident, and should be discussed separately. (3) The family members of the passerby Sun Caisheng who was killed should be given preferential treatment. (4) The injured child Wang Zhenjia should be properly treated. You must handle and report separately. The injured police officers should also be treated as necessary. (3) Wu, Commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police: The area around Pingliang Road, Meizhou Road is remote, and hooligans and injured soldiers use each other to set up gambling stalls, which not only harms military discipline, but also affects public security. You should quickly work with the police branch in charge to ban them effectively. If they dare to resist, send them to the Department for handling according to law.</p>

<h3>Yang Ge's Smuggling of Weapons Case: Air Transport Team Received Secret Tip in Guangzhou, Telegraphed Shanghai to Alert and Seize; Xingzong Repeatedly Stated Yang's Status as Passenger</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The case of American pilot Yang Ge, who took a Xingzong Air Transport Corps plane from Guangzhou to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM and privately carried weapons, has been detained by the authorities in the Police Headquarters, and yesterday continued to investigate the inside story of his smuggling.</p>
<p>Reporters gathered reports from various sources, knowing that Yang Ge is 26 years old this year. He used to be a pilot for China Airlines. Later, he asked the company for leave. During the leave, Yang Ge was employed by the UN Transport Team as a pilot. This time, the UN provided the Xingzong Air Transport Corps with an airplane, which was transported from Honolulu to China. The plane was flown by Yang Ge after it arrived in China. However, according to regulations, the pilot should be sent back to his place of employment by the team. Therefore, after Yang Ge flew to Guangzhou from Honolulu, he was sent back to Shanghai by the Air Transport Corps. Yang Ge then flew to Shanghai from Guangzhou the morning before yesterday. One minute before the flight took off, the Guangzhou office of the team suddenly received a secret tip that someone had seen Yang disassembling a machine gun when he boarded the plane, along with more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and a left-handed pistol with more than 20 rounds of ammunition, and carried them into the plane. However, due to lack of time, he could not be detained at that time. Therefore, the office immediately notified the Shanghai office by radio at 9:15. After receiving the report, General Chen ordered Colonel Li, an officer of the Inspection Section of the team, to report to the US Consulate and send someone to search. However, the consulate stated that it did not want to advise, so it reported to the customs officers and police station at Longhua Airport. (According to the original schedule, the Air Transport Corps plane was supposed to take off and land at Hongqiao Airport, but it was stipulated that it must first fly to Nenghua Airport for customs inspection before it could fly to Hongqiao Airport for landing.)</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, Yang Ge arrived by plane, and the people in charge at the airport were ready to thoroughly search the plane. In Yang's luggage, they found a machine gun, a left-handed pistol, and 1,341 rounds of ammunition. The pistol had a license, but the machine gun had no proof of documents and was indeed smuggled. The police station detained Yang Ge.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Delancey Wash, a spokesperson for the Xingzong Air Transport Corps, repeatedly stated to reporters that "Yang Ge is not a pilot of the Air Transport Corps, but a pilot of the UN Transport Team. Yang Ge's trip from Guangzhou to Shanghai is entirely as an ordinary passenger."</p>
<p>Yang Ge to be Transferred to District Procuratorate Tomorrow</p>
<p>Yang Ge, a suspect in arms trafficking, was interrogated in detail yesterday by the Foreign Affairs Investigation Section of the Criminal Division of the Police Department.

<h3>Prodigal Son Steals, Seeks Death After Spending All the Money</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhu Gengxin, a young man from Ningbo with no occupation, resided at No. 26, Lane 569, Shaanxi South Road. On the 16th of last month, together with his friends Yao Zhengtai (a manager at Canada Flour Mill) and Zhang Jinrong (who runs a restaurant business), he went to the home of Mr. Weina Jian, the Russian manager of the Canada Flour Mill at No. 1, Lane 12, Yuzhou Lane, Nanjing West Road, and jointly stole 95 pieces of coffee-colored and dark green American glass leather wallets, worth 4 million yuan. They sold them to a used goods stall in the Republic of China for 3.2 million yuan. At 7 PM on the 19th of the same month, Zhu Gengxin's girlfriend, dancer Yu Wenzhen, divided the money equally in a rented room at No. 11, Yongqing Lane, Shunchang Road. At that time, Zhu and Zhang each received 1 million yuan, while Yao Zhengtai received 1.2 million yuan alone. On the other hand, Yao, after the theft, had reported the theft to the Lujiawan Police Station on the 18th of the same month on behalf of Mr. Weina Fu, the Russian manager of Canada Flour Mill, and requested an investigation. After investigation by the police, they learned that Zhu was a suspect and went to his home to arrest him but failed. According to Zhu's father, Gengxin used to work in the Green Field Restaurant and had committed theft and had been expelled. Who knew that Guangxin had spent all the money after getting it. On the first day of this month, he went to Suzhou and attempted suicide in a Suzhou hotel. After interrogation by the Wuxian Police Station, Zhu said: His father was the manager of the Green Field Restaurant and had a lot of property, but he was abused by his stepmother, so he came to Suzhou to commit suicide. At that time, policeman Lu Tingming persuaded him to stay, paid 89,000 yuan, and the two of them came to Shanghai on the 12th. At the entrance of Ningbo Merchants Hotel opposite the Great World, Zhu told Lu to wait a moment, pretending to go home to get the money, and never returned. Lu then returned to Suzhou to report. The Suzhou Police Station suspected Lu of being involved in Zhu's escape, so Lu was detained. When he committed suicide in Suzhou, the Wuxian Police Station notified his family by phone to pick him up. His father reported to the police station here and sent the police to Suzhou to meet and bring him back, which happened to be in the opposite direction of Zhu and police Lu's arrival in Shanghai. Later, the bureau learned that Zhu was hiding in the home of his cousin Gu Yinshu at No. 39, Lane 598, Dongyuhang Road, Hongkou, and was finally arrested on the morning of the 18th. Yao Zhengtai and Zhang Jinrong were also arrested and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation after the interrogation.</p>

<h3>Xingzong Fishing Boat Caught Fire, Exploded, and Sank; Two Engineers Burned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 9:30 AM yesterday, a gasoline boat of the Xingzong Fuxing Island Fisheries Management Office caught fire and exploded due to sparks from repairing the electric box igniting the gasoline tank. Although efforts were made to put out the fire, it eventually sank due to the excessive flames. At that time, two Chinese engineers were slightly injured.</p>
<p>Wang Renlin, director of the Fisheries Management Office, reported the detailed process to the authorities, stating that at 9:30 AM yesterday, the gasoline fishing boat No. 6624 of the office was repairing the electric box when a spark suddenly flew onto the gasoline stored in the machine room, causing an immediate explosion. At that time, nearby personnel quickly drove the surrounding boats away and used fire extinguishers to put out the fire. However, because the ship contained gasoline and other flammable materials, the fire could not be extinguished for a while. As a result, they could only tow it to the center of the Huangpu River and pour river water to sink it. At that time, two Chinese engineers who were setting up the electric box were burned, and their injuries were minor.</p>

Previously, it sent personnel to contact the Nanjing Education Bureau. Director Ma of the Education Bureau recently convened a meeting of principals of national schools in the city and invited Director Wu Yinyi of the Ministry of Education to attend and provide guidance, providing and discussing many opinions on improving school equipment and teaching, and making preparations.

<h3>Measures for Chinese Edition of American University Textbooks Not Yet Finalized</h3>
<p>Many of the textbooks used in universities in our country have always been American books. Since the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was agreed upon, our country can no longer reprint them as before, and due to foreign exchange restrictions, American books cannot come to China in large quantities, so domestic universities are suffering from a book shortage. Recently, a representative of the American McGraw-Hill Book Company was specially sent to China for inspection. The Ministry of Education had discussed with him to ask them to hand over the publication of Chinese editions to major Chinese publishing houses and agree on a contract. The representative of the company agreed to consider it. According to insiders: Chinese political institutions and the general public still need to develop respect for copyright and law-abiding habits. Recently, when the Ministry of Education dealt with the issue of national textbooks, it issued an order to interpret the copyright law and unilaterally changed the contract, and confiscated the copyright of various books. The matter was quite special. The company was worried about repeating the same mistake and was quite hesitant. It has now reported to the head office and is studying it in detail. It is said that it will make a request to ensure the copyright is guaranteed before signing a contract.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 19th] The Ministry of Education believes that the existing provincial education colleges are for cultivating social education personnel, not for cultivating teachers for secondary schools. Now provinces such as Shaanxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi have established normal junior colleges specializing in cultivating teachers for their own provinces.

<h3>New School in Guanwai, Changchun University</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Shenyang Reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>Changda students are very disciplined, and the general Northeastern students have the virtue of being disciplined.</p>
<p>The history of the establishment of National Changchun University is very short, and the problems that have occurred in a very short period are worth noting. The future of Changda is something that people who pay attention to Northeastern education are very concerned about. Changda opened in the winter of last year, and is now facing a barren spring. The impact of spring on the psychology of young students is very profound. How to develop this barren land in spring is not only a problem for Changda, but also a major problem for the Northeastern education community.</p>
<p>The issue of university education ideology has attracted special attention from people in society in recent years, and many scholars and experts have studied it with great care. In the Northeast, this issue is especially important. Northeastern youths and Guannei youths have the same hopes and impulses for politics, and their feelings of the bitterness and annoyance of reality are more sensitive and dangerous than those of Guannei youths. Generally speaking, Northeastern youths' political understanding is extremely superficial, and Northeastern youths' ideological direction also needs active leadership. The smartest way is to lead them in a positive way and encourage their self-confidence. Discarding them, coercing them, or letting them go are all foolish behaviors. To give an example: When Mr. Huang Jinru, President of Changda, reported on his work in Beijing last year, he talked to reporters about the problem of Northeastern education and said that the "enslaved" education received by Northeastern youths was the most profound. When Northeastern youths heard this, they were very dissatisfied, and Changda students also roared against the word "enslavement" in the readers' column of the newspaper here. The fact is the fact, but the language stung the patriotic heart of Northeastern youths. This proves that Japan's education in the Northeast was a complete failure.</p>
<p>The more than 2,000 students in Changda's six colleges and twenty-three departments are now concentrated in the old site of the puppet Manchukuo University of Technology for classes. The dormitories are the residences of Japanese officials during the puppet Manchukuo period, not far away. Changda originally took over a lot of houses, but in winter they had to concentrate together for classes because of the lack of coal. In the spring, they can repair some of the houses they have taken over that have few doors and no windows, and they will be very comfortable in the summer. I went to visit their dining hall, which was originally an affiliated factory of the puppet Manchukuo University of Technology. All the machines have long been moved, and the students eat sorghum rice for three meals. In the morning, it is porridge, and for lunch and dinner, each person has a bowl of cabbage soup, with very little oil. Their lives are very hard. Poor students and demobilized youths from the Youth Army account for 80%, and they are all publicly funded students. Self-funded students account for only 20%. Their dressing and clothing are the same as the students in the rear universities during the war. On the surface, although the clothes they wear are not very ragged, they are by no means tidy, and 80% of the students cannot talk about family support.</p>
<p>Books and professors are both problems in Changda. The supply of books is difficult. In addition to Japanese books, there are no reference books at all. This is a very heavy task in teaching. Many professors hold concurrent positions, and some treat teaching as a sideline, often missing classes. Students are very dissatisfied with this, because students' desire for knowledge is very urgent, and they feel that missing a class is a debt owed to them. They all hope that this phenomenon can be improved as soon as possible. The dialect of the professors has also become a major problem. A philosophy professor from Hunan, the students could not understand his full-mouthed Hunan dialect. Fortunately, this professor was a student in Japan and spoke Japanese very well, so he changed to lecturing in Japanese, but demobilized youths from the Youth Army who were not from the Northeast were helpless. Also, because the students' levels are uneven, the professors can only cater to the students with lower levels, so the students in the third grade of the Department of Economics are still taking bookkeeping courses, and the students with higher levels feel boring and tasteless. There is a Department of Journalism in the College of Arts, and the people who attend the lectures are very crowded, probably because journalism is a relatively new thing. It is said that Changda will add a Department of Journalism in the next semester.</p>
<p>Changda students are very disciplined, and the general Northeastern students have the virtue of being disciplined. In terms of the management of the school authorities, they emphasize discipline. The need for disciplinaryization of young students has its value in the Northeast. The country and society today give young people too much spiritual stimulation, and its impact is very profound. Although young students' emotions are rich, they are not very rational after all. If students' behavior is not restrained at all and they are allowed to indulge, it will not only affect students' studies, but also be terrible for the corruption of their physical and mental health and morality. In terms of Changda students' discipline, it can be seen from one thing that their classrooms and dormitories are about five miles away from the auditorium, and students automatically run there every Monday for commemorative weeks, and no one is lazy. The school authorities' restraints on students are stricter than those of universities in the interior, and the students do not feel that their freedom has been deprived. Because they are used to a disciplined life, they do not feel any inconvenience.</p>
<p>Because Changda's members include students from 17 universities in the puppet Manchukuo, the content of this combination is very complicated. Feudal consciousness is still at work, forming the opposition of small groups, and even openly causing trouble. When electing the chairman of the student union in the Law School, there was a big fight for a while, and later the officers' school faction prevailed. This kind of factional struggle will undoubtedly affect the future discipline of the school. So far, the gulf between factions clearly exists, which is unfortunate for the school. In any case, their student union has been organized.</p>
<p>Changda students have a thrifty style. Their material lives are very hard, but they can be self-reliant, study hard, and about one-fifth of the students are working and studying. They cherish this school with such a spirit of learning, and the future of Changda is bright. April 14 in Changchun.</p>

<h3>Mayor Summons Rice Industry Representatives for Talks; Strict Punishment for Black Market Activities; Municipal Government Sells Rice at a Limited Price of 135,000 Yuan per Stone</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Mayor Wu is determined to thoroughly realize the issue of suppressing and stabilizing rice prices in the city and has great confidence in this regard. At 9:00 AM yesterday, he specially summoned nine representatives of rice shops and merchants in the city, including Cui Zhenhua, Yang Runhui, Hu Chenggang, distributor Zha Baoshan, Yang Jiuzi, Yin Fuxiang and Hu Wenan from the Nanshi Market, and Xu Songren and Cai Shengming from the Beishi Market, for a lengthy discussion. Mayor Wu stated that prices in rice-producing areas are now trending downward, and rice prices in the city should also fall back. He hopes that the merchants will work together to overcome the difficulties of the times and not hoard or speculate. As for the 9,000 dan of rice required daily in the city, the government has decided to allocate and sell it at a limited price of 135,000 yuan. If there are still black market activities thereafter, once discovered, they will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<p>Three Major Decisions to Suppress Rice Prices</p>
<p>After meeting with the grain merchants, Mayor Wu met with reporters and spoke about three decisions to stabilize rice prices: (1) Since the implementation of the economic emergency measures in February to suppress and stabilize prices in the city, we have taken a two-pronged approach from both economic and political perspectives. The rise in rice prices has the greatest impact on people's livelihoods. The municipal government will continue to sell white japonica and indica rice until the rice price in the city is balanced with that of the producing areas. Today, the limited price in the city has been slightly increased, but only downwards and not upwards, suppressing it to the target of 144,000 to balance with the 130,000 in the producing areas. (2) Suppressing rice prices in the producing areas. Since Chairman Thirteen arrived in Shanghai and issued strict orders for implementation, on the 15th, the central government immediately dispatched officials to cooperate with the Jiangsu Provincial Government to vigorously implement it. The municipal government currently has 130,000 tons of rice in storage, totaling 450,000 bags, and foreign rice and Sichuan rice continue to be transported and sold without problems. Rice prices will definitely fall in the short term. (3) If there are any cases of exceeding the limited price, the authorities have established measures to crack down and will severely punish without leniency. The municipal government has telegraphed the police局 that violators will be arrested.</p>
<p>Investigating Rice Shops for Raising Prices</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Economic investigators yesterday again discovered that the Daxin Rice Shop on Ouyang Road and the Yixing Rice Shop were raising market prices and were suspected of hoarding. The Daxin Rice Shop sold white japonica rice at a black market price of 180,000 yuan per stone and foreign indica rice at 170,000 yuan per stone at 4:00 PM on the 18th. The Yixing Rice Shop raised the price of white japonica rice to 200,000 yuan per stone. Yesterday morning, the fourth section of the administrative department of the police局 summoned Liu Fuqing, the accountant of Daxin Rice Shop, and Liu Yongchang, the manager of Yixing Rice Shop, to the bureau for questioning and detained them as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Prices in Producing Areas Fall; Japonica Currency Continues to Plunge</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 3,600 shi of rice grain arrived in the north and south markets, and rice allocation continued to be sold. Prices in the interior fell, shops were cold and slack, the market was quiet, and the supply exceeded demand. Japonica and indica rice all continued to plummet by 10,000 yuan, and Ziyin and Yuanyin also fell back by 5,000 yuan successively.</p>
<p>Flour sales were sluggish, and prices fell by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wheat bran continued to be cut by 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were very strong, plummeting by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans, with oil cakes downstream, were sluggish and fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>

Sesame followed other items in falling by 10,000 yuan, red sorghum followed by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and corn was hoped for by households, but only by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Only mung beans were scarce and firm, and broad beans were lively, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil, due to merchants selling to distant merchants, oil factories, etc., and the oil industry association jointly strengthening the sale of parity oil and prohibiting the export of edible oil, the pressure was great, and it became a tragic plunge.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Firmly Strong</h3>
<p>The public bond market still felt good yesterday. The National Banking Association had various proposals, and it was heard that the multiple of court rulings in other ports was even higher, and the buying sentiment gradually moved. The unified C started at a low price of 13,800 yuan in the morning and returned to the market, finally rising to 15,000 yuan outside the market. The asking price continued to rise after closing, and as a result, each price reported rose by more than 1,000 yuan compared to the previous closing, with a turnover of about 6 million.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Mediocre</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were only mediocre yesterday, and a slight weakness appeared in the middle. The prosperity of the black market exchange rate finally showed stability. Yisha started at 40,600 yuan in the morning and broke into the 40,000 yuan level in the middle, finally hovering outside the level. As a result, the telephone association, Jardine Matheson, was flat compared to the previous closing. Paper, shipping, land reclamation, and Kwong each rose by half a percent, and the rest reported a slight increase.</p>

<p>It is reported that after the exchange rate for remittances to Guangzhou and Shantou has repeatedly risen, remittances to the two places are often remitted through Guangxi, so the exchange rate in Guangxi has also increased. In addition, recently, new cotton in Central China has entered the market and urgently needs funds for procurement. However, transportation is still inconvenient in various places, affecting the transfer of cash. Therefore, the exchange rate for various places in Central China has also increased. It is said that the exchange rate of commercial banks to Hankou and Changsha is in the range of 80 to 90 yuan.</p>

<h3>Export Tea Market Lacks Vitality</h3>
<p>Recently, the export tea market has not only failed to improve but has also continued to weaken. The reason is that most goods owners, aware that the new tea of this year is gradually approaching the picking and production season, are eager to sell off their old tea in order to acquire new tea. However, buyers are not eager to absorb it and are taking the opportunity to push down prices. Transactions are sporadic, and the market is difficult to improve. Recently, suppliers' willingness to sell has slightly rebounded, but purchasers are only taking advantage of opportunities to buy at low prices, so the trend remains stagnant and difficult to improve. The situation for various types of domestic tea remains similar to that of the previous day, as supply meets demand and sentiment lacks momentum.</p>
<h3>Hard Coal Dust Prices Surge</h3>
<p>High-grade hard coal dust, such as Kailuan dust, Keelung dust, and Fuxin dust, continues to sell well, and prices are rising again. Intermediate-grade hard coal dust, such as Polot dust and Fengcheng dust, and low-grade hard coal dust, such as Baoshan dust and Changshan dust, continue to arrive, and although prices have also risen, traders' willingness to buy is weaker, and transactions are average. Sales of briquettes in various coal shops have recently gradually increased, but prices in various factories remain the same. The market for white coal is thin in terms of both arrivals and inventory, and prices are firm. The market is quite strong. Firewood and charcoal lack momentum to rise, and prices remain mediocre.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from Northern Shaanxi (3): North of Yan'an</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhou, Sent from Xi'an on the 8th</p>
<p>In the battles of Northern Shaanxi, the Chinese Communists (CCP) have consistently miscalculated strategically in their "defensive war." This was the case in the Battle of Yan'an, as well as in the battles around Yan'an and in areas to the north, such as Wayao Fort.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 8th, Deputy Chief of Staff Xie of the First War Zone said in his operational report: "Ideally, we thought that in the Battle of Yan'an, because Chen Fa's troops were transferred from Jin (Shanxi) to the west of Yan'an, about 80-100 li away, Yan'an had already been liberated, so this fresh force did not catch up with 'defending Chairman Mao,' and 'Greater Yan'an' was already 'lost.'" We thought that north of Yan'an, a fierce battle would be inevitable. In fact, this was not the case at all, and our army continued to pursue smoothly."</p>
<p>Heavy Troops Deployed Around Wayao Fort</p>
<p>After recovering Yan'an, the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) spent three days clearing up the remnants of the CCP near the city. They began to advance on the 24th. At this time, the CCP's headquarters had moved to Wayao Fort. In the CCP's estimation, the NRA would take advantage of the momentum of capturing Yan'an and definitely attack Wayao Fort to the north. Therefore, heavy troops were deployed around Wayao Fort, intending to show the attacking NRA some resistance in this area. According to what we heard at the time, the CCP's 3rd Brigade and 4th Brigade of the police force were in Panlongzhen, the 358th Brigade was in Yongping, the Training Brigade was north of Yongping, the New 8th Brigade was in Wayao Fort, the New 9th Brigade was in Dantou, and the Honor 1st Brigade and 2nd Brigade were near Anding. Of course, the actual number of troops was not that many, but these were indeed the unit designations. From this, it can be seen that the CCP's defense of Wayao Fort was quite tight at the time. They also declared that they would return to Yan'an."</p>
<p>The Most Exciting Scene: Capturing Wujiazhai</p>
<p>The attack began with a small number of NRA troops slowly advancing north, feigning an attack on Panlong and Yongping. In fact, the main force advanced towards Yanchuan. At the same time, south of Yanchang, NRA troops also coordinated by advancing north from Linzhen. On the 27th, they captured Yuguyi, and on the 28th, the troops advancing east recovered Yanchuan. The remnants of the CCP outside Yanchang were attacked from both sides and had their retreat cut off, and they scattered in panic. Yanchang was also captured by the NRA. On the 30th, they cleared the area near Yanchuan and Yanchang. At this time, the CCP had transferred two brigades from the west to reinforce Jianjian to the east. After several fierce battles on the 31st, the CCP forces collapsed, and Jianjian was also captured.</p>
<p>From Yanchuan to Jianjian, it is Suide to the north, which is a main road, just like from Luochuan to Yan'an. Therefore, after the NRA entered Jianjian, the CCP assumed that the NRA had changed its route and would advance north along the highway, launching a frontal attack. Therefore, they transferred another batch of troops to deploy south of Suide, waiting for the NRA to advance north. However, the NRA turned around and attacked Wayao Fort, and captured it on April 3rd. On the 4th, they began to pursue northeast. At the same time, they captured Wujiazhai, where they captured a lot of the CCP's supplies. Important items included a radio station, automobiles, the Xinhua Printing Factory, a yarn factory, etc. After the Battle of Yan'an, this battle should be considered the most exciting scene.</p>
<p>"Second Yan'an" May Be Wutai Mountain</p>
<p>Although the CCP forces in Northern Shaanxi were discouraged after the NRA captured Yan'an, they did not lose hope. Therefore, in those few days, after the CCP lost a place, they mostly retreated to the northwest. This sign indicates that although Yan'an was "lost," the CCP had not forgotten about Northern Shaanxi. They were waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, so "returning to Yan'an" was not just a bluff, but they had the strength and intention to do so.</p>
<p>The NRA's victory during these ten days from March 24th to April 3rd (advancing 420 li) changed this idea of the CCP. According to intelligence I heard in Yan'an, after Wayao Fort changed hands, the main force of the CCP began to retreat east. At the same time, on the evening of the 6th, the CCP's Wang Zhen's troops, with the designations of four brigades and the actual strength of eight regiments, launched a surprise attack from west to east in Wujia South and north of Yongping. At the same time, the CCP's defending forces in Wayao Fort exceptionally did not retreat to the northwest towards Suide. From these two events, it can be seen that the CCP may no longer defend Northern Shaanxi stubbornly and not commit its main force. When necessary, the main force will withdraw east, leaving behind some guerrillas, and then try to take the opportunity to rise again. As for where the CCP's "Second Yan'an" should be, according to CCP prisoners of war: "It may be Wutai Mountain in Shanxi."</p>
<p>General Hu Zongnan on the Future of the Shaanxi War</p>
<p>How will the war in Northern Shaanxi develop in the short term? This reporter asked many senior officials, and their opinions can be summarized into two points: First, the NRA's purpose is to destroy the CCP's old nest, so that the CCP understands the power of the government, and does not want to kill a certain number of people to show the public. "In the strategy of war, winning back the hearts of the people is the best policy, and encircling and annihilating them is the worst policy." (Words of a senior official) We judge that there will not be a large-scale war in Northern Shaanxi, and neither side will sacrifice more people. Second, the NRA's strategy may tend to be a frontal attack. In the past two days, the NRA in Yulin may attack Mizhi to the south, and another route will capture Hengshan and then Jingbian, possibly joining forces with the NRA forces under Ning Ma, and then joining forces with the NRA forces advancing north from Yan'an to the southwest. In this way, the NRA's three-sided encirclement of the CCP in Northern Shaanxi will be completed. Before the encirclement can be tightened, it is feared that the pincers of Qingjian and Mizhi will force the main force of the CCP to fight one or two more fierce battles, and then withdraw east, leaving behind a part to resist and conduct guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>General Hu Zongnan said in a press conference on the evening of the 7th: "...I think that before this goal is achieved, Suide can be taken down, and by the end of May, all of Northern Shaanxi can be gradually recovered." Then the next month and a half should be the end of the war in Northern Shaanxi. (Completed in Xi'an on April 8th.)</p>
<h3>Characteristics and Essentials of the New Banking Law</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhaoyuan</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>China's Banking Law, promulgated by the National Government on March 28, 1931, has remained unimplemented for sixteen years. However, the Savings Bank Law, promulgated and implemented on July 4, 1934, has been in effect for over twelve years. During these years, including the eight years of the War of Resistance, the socio-economic landscape has undergone tremendous changes. The government's regulation of banks has inevitably involved the issuance of orders or the establishment of measures as needed. This has led to concerns about the government focusing on one aspect while neglecting others, and banks facing difficulties in adapting. In August 1945, with the end of the war, the economy was expected to transition to a peacetime state. Under the direction of President Sun, the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committees began to revise the Banking Law. Sixteen committee members, including Zhang Zhaoyuan, Ma Yinchu, Lou Tongsun, Chen Changheng, Dai Xiujun, Wei Tingsheng, Di Ying, Liu Tong, Li Qing, Yao Chuanfa, Huang Yunsu, Chen Zifeng, Jian Guansan, Li Yuanbai, Liu Butong, and Sun Jiulu, were appointed for the initial review. Zhang Zhaoyuan was designated as the convener to begin drafting. After multiple discussions and seven revisions, the draft was finalized at a joint meeting of the Finance and Economic Committees on April 12, 1947. It was then thoroughly discussed at the Legislative Yuan, passing the first reading with reservation for a second reading during the 322nd session on April 17 of the same year. The motivations, principles, and process of revising the Banking Law are detailed below:</p>
<p>There are three motivations for revising the Banking Law:</p>
<p>(1) The Banking Law promulgated on March 28, 1931, has never been implemented. It would be more accurate to consider this the enactment of a new banking law rather than a revision of the old one. For the past decade, all bank regulations have been implemented through orders or measures. During the turbulent political and economic conditions of wartime, these ad hoc arrangements were tolerated by the people. However, in peacetime, with increasing stability, there must be clear and legally defined regulations for both the government and the people to follow.</p>
<p>(2) The old Banking Law was never implemented, and the Savings Bank Law is also outdated. Furthermore, trust companies, which are a type of bank, and money shops (錢莊), which are local financial institutions with centuries of history predating modern banks, and the legal status of foreign banks following the abolition of unequal treaties, all need to be clearly defined in one law.</p>
<p>(3) Banks are the linchpin of all industries. Whether it is agriculture, industry, commerce, or any other business, or even individuals, they all rely on financial institutions to facilitate the receipt and payment of funds, ensuring the flow and activity of capital between production and consumption. Therefore, the importance of banks in society is evident. To achieve progress in all industries, it is essential to have sound and compliant financial institutions. Therefore, the swift enactment of a banking law is necessary.</p>
<p>Principles for Revising the Banking Law</p>
<p>There are ten principles for revising the Banking Law:</p>
<p>(1) Except for national banks and provincial and county banks, which are subject to separate regulations, all private or joint government-private banks are governed by a single law. Based on the experience of regulating financial businesses and the needs of the financial industry, the law broadly adopts and incorporates various elements, clarifying all previous orders and measures, summarizing key points, aiming for permanence, simplicity, and clarity, and seeking to align with reality. The goal is to ensure that there are no supplementary clauses outside the Banking Law that misinterpret or alter its true intent.</p>
<p>(2) Banks are divided into five types. Each type conducts its business, enjoys rights, and fulfills obligations according to its category. Those already approved to establish and operate can either maintain their current status or gradually make corrections. Those applying for establishment must strictly adhere to the new Banking Law, ensuring that in the near future, all types of banks are brought into compliance, preventing deceptive practices, and promoting parallel development.</p>
<p>(3) Increase legal flexibility to avoid Procrustean solutions, simplify government intervention, and encourage free development. For example, bank capital is not fixed due to fluctuating currency values and different economic conditions in various regions. The central regulatory authority will divide the country into regions and separately approve capital amounts (Article 19). Banks' guarantee reserves can be offset by government bonds, treasury bills, and corporate bonds, benefiting both the government and banks (Articles 48, 57, 67, etc.). Government regulation is based on regional standards, taking into account the economic and financial conditions of each region. Within the same region, there should be no preferential or discriminatory treatment.</p>
<p>(4) Be pragmatic, eliminate pretense, emphasize guidance, and remove passive restrictions. Past laws, due to extraordinary times, had to impose strict restrictions, addressing problems piecemeal. As a result, banks, for their own benefit, were forced to feign compliance, avoid important issues, and take the easy way out. Initially, a few attempted to exploit loopholes, but eventually, many followed suit, becoming a common practice. Ultimately, making false statements became an open secret, deviating from the fundamental principle of trustworthiness in banking. Instead of correcting abuses, it aided wrongdoing, contradicting the intention of the legislation. Therefore, the new Banking Law, on one hand, allows freedom of business development, specifying regulations according to each category, such as setting loan limits based on total deposits (Articles 29-51, 52, 61-63, 71-74, 86, 92, and 94). On the other hand, it strictly prohibits false accounting. (Articles 43 and 79, etc.)</p>
<p>(5) Establish a clear system applicable nationwide. The central regulatory authority can divide the country into regions and separately approve capital amounts, and also determine the required capital for each region and the amount needed for a certain type of bank to concurrently operate other banking businesses (Article 19). It can also prohibit the establishment of new banks or certain types of banks based on the economic and financial conditions of each region (Article 23). For example, China has a vast territory with significant differences in economic conditions. What is suitable for the southeast may not be suitable for the northwest. What is surplus in large metropolitan areas may be urgently needed in remote areas. The new Banking Law has a high degree of flexibility, adapting to different environments and adjusting the supply and demand in various regions.</p>
<p>(6) Different types of banks are subject to separate regulations based on the nature of their business. Commercial banks prioritize flexibility, industrial banks value stability, savings banks aim to strictly protect depositors, trust companies must faithfully fulfill trust agreements, and money shops (錢莊) emphasize their customs. All types of banks take credibility and realism as fundamental principles. For example, commercial banks are not forced to invest in industry (Article 50), industrial banks must prioritize industrial lending (Articles 58 and 60), specialized banks should increase their business loans to over 50%, savings banks and trust companies, under certain conditions, are required to hold their responsible persons jointly and severally liable with unlimited liability (Articles 77 and 88), and the credit loans of money shops (錢莊) are limited to below 50% (Article 94).</p>
<p>(7) The scope of business of trust companies is wider than that of any other bank. Trust companies also aspire to be all-encompassing and do everything, wanting to cover banking, trust, insurance, notarization, real estate, stocks, construction, law, accounting, and even matters relating to personnel before and after death. However, China's trust industry is still in its infancy, and it is questionable whether it has such a strong capacity. Furthermore, services that require qualification through examination, such as those of lawyers, accountants, and architects, do not seem to be appropriate for trust companies to provide, as they may encroach on free professions. Article 86 stipulates that when trust companies perform trust services involving legal, accounting, personnel, or other non-financial matters, they should engage registered and qualified lawyers, accountants, or other specialized technicians to perform them, which effectively avoids major negligence by trust companies and protects the interests of the trustors.</p>
<p>(9) Money shops (錢莊) have a long history, established customs, and strong local ties. In China today, where banks have not yet become widespread nationwide, towns and villages cannot do without money shops to regulate local finance. Although some money shops in large metropolitan areas are larger than banks, the majority of money shops nationwide are smaller than banks. The new Banking Law permits the existence and establishment of money shops (Chapter VII), emphasizes their local customs (Article 93), and relaxes the limits on credit loans according to their customs (Article 94). In addition to commercial banking business, they may also engage in other banking businesses (Article 95). However, due to their strong local ties and the significant differences in the customs of money shops in various regions, the establishment of branches is restricted (Article 96). Moreover, when their capital meets the minimum capital requirement for banks, they should be renamed as banks (Article 93, Paragraph 2). This is to ensure that, at a suitable time in the future, when China's economic strength is strong, banks will be established nationwide, and money shops will become a historical term.</p>
<p>(9) The regulations for foreign banks do not adopt the lenient approach of the UK or the restrictive measures of the US. They are based on China's own position, economic needs, and the nearly century-long history of foreign banks in China as factors in determining the legislative intent. China needs foreign investment to aid its construction as an established economic policy, and the fact that foreign capital is more abundant and interest rates are lower is undeniable. Furthermore, China lacks connections in foreign trade and does not yet have a linked organization for handling foreign exchange, so it seems necessary to rely on foreign banks to expand China's foreign trade and serve as a guide for Chinese banks to establish branches abroad. Therefore, the new Banking Law permits foreign banks to engage in commercial banking business to benefit China's foreign trade and industrial banking business to aid China's domestic construction (Article 102). However, they are not allowed to concurrently engage in savings bank or trust company business (Article 103), and their fixed-term deposits are limited to use within China (Article 105). These are extremely reasonable provisions and have no discriminatory intent. Article 101, which concerns the areas where foreign banks can be established, is consistent with the intent of Article 22 and is particularly reasonable.</p>
<p>(10) Banks are a type of company. According to Article 12 of the Company Law, companies are divided into five types. The establishment of a bank can choose one of the five types of companies to organize. Foreign banks are also a type of foreign company and can apply for special permission according to the regulations for foreign companies in the Company Law. Therefore, the procedures and fees for banks applying for business registration, foreign banks applying for special permission, and other registrations of banks shall be governed by the provisions of the Company Law. This simplifies the registration procedures and provides convenience to both Chinese and foreign banks. The Banking Law is a special law of the Company Law, so the provisions already existing in the general law are not listed in this special law.</p>
<p>The above ten points are the major ones and are therefore called principles. In addition, the revisions and additions to the articles, as well as the results of textual refinements, are scattered throughout the articles and will not be listed individually. Regarding bank accounting, there were originally some clauses in the draft, but because the Commercial Accounting Law is currently under review in the Legislative Yuan and is expected to be passed and promulgated soon, so that the national commercial accounting will have uniform measures, it is not listed in the new Banking Law either.</p>
<p>Since the Banking Law promulgated on March 28, 1931, has not been implemented, and the Savings Bank Law promulgated and implemented on July 4, 1934, is largely the same as the savings bank provisions of the new Banking Law, there is no need for a clause-by-clause comparison. Since there were no previous regulations for industrial banks, trust companies, money shops (錢莊), and foreign banks, this is the first time they have been created, so there is no object for comparison either, so they are also omitted.</p>
<p>When revising laws, three points should be paid attention to: (1) Whether it is in line with reality and can be promoted smoothly. (2) Whether it is flexible and extensible and can be popularized nationwide. (3) Whether it has fulfilled its potential and can be passed down for a long time. Although the author has studied it in detail for more than a year, there is no guarantee of perfection. There are many difficulties in this revision of the Banking Law, and the major ones are about five points:</p>
<p>(1) During the War of Resistance, there was currency inflation, and now, nearly two years after the end of the war, the currency value has not yet stabilized. It is even more difficult to predict what will happen in the future, and in some areas, the situation is special, with locally used currencies, so where a specific number should be determined, another standard of calculation has to be sought.</p>
<p>(2) China has a vast territory, with great differences in customs and even greater differences in economy and finance. It is impossible to find a common standard suitable for all regions. Moreover, the situation during the war is different from that in the early years, and the situation after the war may not be similar to that before the war. In this period of drastic economic changes, the former is not sufficient as a law, and the latter is difficult to grasp, but it is impossible to write out of thin air and close the door to build a cart.</p>
<p>(3) Although opinions from all parties are widely solicited, many are inevitably based on their own interests, with each having its own position and reasons. Different people have different views, making it difficult for the intermediary to make a decision, and it is not possible to do one's best by compromising and compromising.</p>
<p>(4) Money shops (錢莊) in China have a long history and deeply ingrained habits, while the history of banking is temporary but extremely complex. The process of development is different, and it is not easy to unify the regulations. If the legislative standard is low, one will lose sight of the other and be stretched thin. If the legislative standard is high, there will be evasion and trickery, and it will be difficult to implement the law. It is also not easy to find a standard that is not too high or too low, and that is moderately lenient and strict, so that everyone can easily abide by it.</p>
<p>(5) During peacetime legislation, it is natural to replace the passive restrictions and constraints of the extraordinary period with active guidance and incentives. However, in recent years, the vast majority of those engaged in the banking industry have been engaged in their banking business, but there are also those who use banks as a cover to engage in speculation, manipulation, and hoarding for profit. Actively guiding and rewarding them would be beneficial to this group, while passive restrictions and constraints would inevitably harm legitimate bankers. Good and bad are mixed, and it is difficult to distinguish between black and white. Therefore, in the guidance and incentives, there are still traces of restrictions and constraints.</p>
<p>The above difficulties are not easy to overcome, and the regulations are tentative and can be used as a reference for future sages.</p>

<h3>Raphael's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Xu Fan</p>
<p>One day, as Raphael was painting, a friend from afar came in and watched the artist's work. "You are making great progress in painting, Raphael..." he said passionately, "I have just returned from Florence, and I wish you could see Leonardo's paintings, especially the horses! Their four feet are firmly on the ground, and their manes tremble with anger. I do not deny that Perugino is a good painter—but, but Leonardo's horses!"</p>
<p>Raphael abruptly threw aside the brush beside him. "Go there?" his friend asked. Raphael replied eagerly, "Go to Florence!"</p>
<p>Raphael had often heard about the beauty of Florence. Perugino also often mentioned to his students the great artists living in that city, described their marble palaces, depicted the lovely gardens, and told them about the dome in the cathedral, which was more beautiful than any building in the world. Raphael's heart was filled with the desire to go to beautiful Florence.</p>
<p>Now, he had arrived in this beautiful city. He was quickly familiarized with and loved by the great artists of Florence. His beauty and gentle face made him quickly acquainted with many friends wherever he went. The beautiful paintings in his studio won people's admiration, among which a painting called "Saint Mary of the Garden" was painted in Florence and is still hanging in the art exhibition hall in Paris.</p>
<p>Florence is a large city in Rome, famous for its beautiful paintings and magnificent architecture. Among them is the palace of the Roman Pope, called the Vatican, which has more than a thousand rooms. Many of the rooms have paintings on the walls. The Roman Pope is always paying attention to famous artists and sending them out on visits. When Raphael was twenty-five years old, he received an invitation from the Roman Pope to go to Rome to paint part of the Vatican Palace.</p>
<p>After that, Raphael's first task was to paint frescoes in the Roman Pope's palace. The Roman Pope liked Raphael's work there very much. He decided to let him decorate the entire hall of the Vatican Palace.</p>
<p>There were many paintings by Perugino and other artists in this hall. In order for Raphael to paint, the Roman Pope ordered all these paintings to be removed. Raphael felt very uneasy when he heard that his teacher's paintings had been removed for his work. He asked the Roman Pope to keep Perugino's paintings, which can still be seen in Rome today.</p>
<p>There is a "Madonna Enthroned" In this painting, we see the little angel lying lovingly in his mother's arms, as if the mother is holding her own child. There is a very moving record in the ancient legend about the entire plot of this painting.</p>
<p>Almost all of Raphael's paintings have lovely children. Look at the young Saint John the Baptist in the Madonna Enthroned, and the little angels in the Sistine Madonna, all of which tell us that the angels in these amazing paintings are second to none.</p>
<p>Also, Raphael's colors, if you pay attention to them, are very gentle and full of enthusiasm, like the almost fantastic power of a brilliant sunset. The colors on his canvas are painted thinly and transparently, and the lines in his paintings sometimes seem to be a bit worse.</p>
<p>In Rome, Raphael's painting was amazing. He became famous like those great artists in Italy. Some people called him the greatest artist in the world. His studio was crowded with artists who hoped to discover some of the subtleties of his painting. This also tells us that Raphael was loved by these many students. Sometimes, there were as many as fifty people walking with him on the street. They were very happy to be close to this painting teacher.</p>
<p>When you see the entire Sistine Madonna, you will definitely feel its extraordinary beauty. It is the most adorable of Raphael's Madonnas. It exists in Germany, hanging in a separate room near Dresden. When people see the mother and angels on it, their eyes are filled with tears. Everyone raises their hats involuntarily and walks past silently. The room is very quiet, and even the slightest noise can be heard.</p>
<p>Raphael unfortunately passed away at the age of thirty-eight, but he will live forever in the hearts of all who have seen his paintings. No one will ever see another painter's paintings that are so loved, so moving, and so perfect.</p>
<h3>Inscriptions on Paintings</h3>
<p>— Hongwei Old Man</p>
<p>Mandarin Ducks and Peach Blossoms</p>
<p>Returning from fishing, rarely ask about the ferry, a fairyland surpassing the secular world, separated by clear dust. Peach blossoms reflect their shadows in the melting place, allowing graceful birds to occupy the beautiful spring.</p>
<p>Hibiscus and Secluded Bird</p>
<p>So much like heavy makeup looking in the mirror, a red shadow ripples in the clear waves. The secluded bird understands the taste of autumn, and the frost falls on the Wu River, yet it is not cold.</p>
<p>Peach Willows and Swallows</p>
<p>In the clear and new weather, the willow wind is light, and a branch of spring enters the small peach red. The swallows from faraway Bali in February seem to say that the scenery of Jiangnan is different.</p>
<p>Azaleas and Orchids</p>
<p>Flowers on the branches like snow, hear the cuckoo in the moonlight. The spiritual root is pure and exquisite, first competing with spring.</p>
<h3>Visiting Gu's Tomb on Qionglong Mountain</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Qionglong Mountain is thirty li southwest of Suzhou. The tomb of Gu Yong, the Prime Minister of the Three Kingdoms Wu, is here. The picture is a work of the author and Mr. Gu Yiqiao visiting the tomb and traveling. The lake and mountains are beautiful, and the brush and ink are vigorous and unrestrained. It is full of misty charm. — Editor's Note</p>
<h3>Two Poems</h3>
<p>— Weng</p>
<p>Mourning Scholar Songcen</p>
<p>After returning from the battlefield, the jade fragments are emerald, and driving to the underworld loses the rugged mountains; a lifetime of offending things is due to the heavens' jealousy, and today the benefactor can only dream of his relatives; growing old, the wheels turn and the hatred of the family and country, in poverty, the words and verses are sold for rice with difficulty; the maple leaves fall in the west mountain and his Wu song ceases, (the gentleman invited to enjoy the red leaves of the west mountain but failed) still thinking of the lonely people by the river.</p>
<p>The hands are skillful and the old are still restored, and the wild history pavilion flowers are blooming on all sides; the integrity can only resign from the official position, and the secluded sorrow can only lie among the weeds; people pity the heavens for belittling the Confucian arts, and I grieve for the country for the tragic talents; rising at night to cry for the gentleman, becomes faint and dim, and there is no curtain shadow to illuminate the deep cup.</p>
<p>General Junzuo of the Poetry Society is going to Lanzhou. Brother Hu Guigeng hosted a banquet to send him off at his residence Lu, and two scholars Xu Shiqi and Wu Zishen immediately made paintings as farewell gifts. Sing this and inscribe it.</p>
<p>Hearing that you will be going to a distant road, I set up a liquor to gather young and old for you. Poets and painters draw their brushes and ink, and a hundred-foot-tall stream falls toward the sky; below are tall pine trees embracing each other, and the empty pavilion is unmanned, and the wind is vast. Discussing the talent of the world, you are in high spirits, and the people in your eyes are not old. The western pass is desolate and the sick horse is nearing its natural lifespan. I want your strong brush to melt the barriers to comprehension. The envoy's tour is not yet finished, and I am drunk and my poems are suddenly completed and overturned.</p>
<h3>Viewing the Painting Exhibition of Old Man Hongwei</h3>
<p>— Chen Honghui Zhongtao</p>
<p>Old Man Hongwei's painting skills are meticulously refined, and his reputation spreads at home and abroad. This time, he held a painting exhibition in Shanghai. Hui humbly is in the ranks of the initiators, and it is impossible not to say a word. The old man's paintings, the setting colors and brushwork, are ancient and secluded, and he has obtained the spirit of Song paintings. And his works of inscription on paintings, both poetry and calligraphy are wonderful, such as reeds and crabs: "The newly brewed golden tulip wine for the Double Ninth Festival, a beautiful gathering to hold a goblet of crab roe, I want to overturn the basket and listen to the cracking sound, and travel sideways back to the water and cloud village." Red parrot hanging bellflower: "Opening the curtains at dawn, the moon has not yet set, the winding corridor is stacked with deep green clouds; do not be surprised that the frost bell in front of the garden is silent, the raven's words can convey the sound of the Brahma's fall." Double ducks and wild rice stems: "The scenery of Jiangnan in March is extraordinary, the peach blossom water is warm and grows new green; the bamboo bow advises you not to shoot lightly, the fighting ducks know how to call for themselves in the wind." Red azalea flowers and cuckoo birds: "The red cliffs and green mountains love this flower, go down to the three Bas in the third month of spring; the urging to return of the pair of crows is really verbose, it is not that the traveler does not miss home." All are excellent and can be passed down. Since ancient times, painters of meticulous flower and bird paintings have found it most difficult to have a lively charm in the ancient and secluded. Therefore, those who have a lively color are the ultimate in skill. Only the old master's paintings are sufficient to match it. The old man has no less than 5,000 disciples; only Miss Wu Huang Zhuoqun can obtain his true biography. Her paintings are delicate and otherworldly, and the high ones are almost indistinguishable from the real ones. Therefore, discussing the old man's artistic achievements, I have hastily written it.</p>
<h3>On the Characteristics of Ancient and Modern Beauty: Discussing Artistic Creation in the New Century</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>The modern culture and art following the Renaissance, based on individual self-awareness, represent the expression of individual beauty, which is entirely the opposite of antiquity. Modern people's beliefs and spirit can be said to be the respect for individuality. In other words, this indicates that humans replace gods as the supreme existence, and with the development of human thought and culture, there has been a transformation of ideals and beauty.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that modern people's individual beauty is much freer than the feudal ideal beauty of ancient people; and it is precisely for this reason that modern society should have a higher cultural evaluation than ancient society. Furthermore, in all senses, the progress of modern people or modern society's civilization may simply be incomparable to antiquity, which is also an undeniable fact. However, conversely, it is also an undeniable fact that under the beautiful name of cultural progress, people are caught in extreme respect for individuality, which leads to ideological fragmentation, unconsciously lose reverence for gods, forget the joy of communal life, and are unconcerned with the pursuit of national ideal beauty.</p>
<p>Ancient times had their ideals and beauty, and modern times have theirs. This is only natural because social conditions differ. Therefore, it is also only natural that the holistic beauty of antiquity and the individual beauty of modern times cannot be discussed in the same breath. This is an issue worthy of our reflection.</p>
<p>Ancient beauty, in the monumental concepts of Egypt, the symbols of valor in Babylon, and the expression of ideal beauty in Greece, had its own independent development in these three themes, and it was on this basis that the great themes of the entire nation were constructed. The cultural will of ancient people was expressed in these forms of art as "eternal compositions." In other words, it was the "creation of national art." However, it also had its shortcomings, namely, the art production of feudal or autocratic politics that underestimated individual and personal power. Conversely, modern beauty takes the manifestation of individuality as its goal, with sensitivity or freedom as its characteristics, and seems to emphasize delicate, keenly sensitive feelings, and takes intellectual artistic expression as its main body. Especially in modern art after Impressionism, this tendency has become increasingly prominent. Modern writers who fully express the joy of personal life in the "festival of light" can be said to be much more civilized than the crude and valiant ancient artists. Therefore, ancient art shines with the state or nation as its background, while modern art shines with the excellence of each writer.</p>
<p>The problem of ancient beauty and modern beauty, in their relative, two major ideological trends, contains important significance, and we should not rush to a conclusion. The importance of this problem lies in juxtaposing ancient beauty and modern beauty, and from the results of this comparative study, creating an ideal of beauty that can benefit the next new era. We must discover the path that leads from antiquity to modernity, and from modernity to antiquity, and from this harmony of classical art and modern art, create the art of the new century.</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of Wang Ge-yi's Pre-Exhibition, In Response to Ding'an's Verse</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>His talent is used to train people as if he can summon immortals, his family's three unique skills are known throughout the land; do not simply listen to the rain in empty mountains, you have already made yourself in Shandong. (Mr. Wang has lived in Shanghai for many years, focusing on painting and calligraphy, rarely involving himself in external affairs.)</p>
<p>The moonlit ground and cloud stairs are doubly cold, it is naturally difficult to write about Lü and Tian'an's women; plum blossoms and chrysanthemum shadows have been consulted throughout, let the ink flow freely in light washes. (He excels at painting plum blossoms and chrysanthemums.)</p>
<p>Gathering scattered anecdotes into one school, who will inherit the literary heritage of the Southeast? Having just washed away the chaotic state, I luckily take advantage of the wine being ripe when the brush becomes blunt. (Mr. Wang is a high-achieving student of Wu Changshuo.)</p>
<p>Lake and mountain are expansive, robbed from the lands of the three Wus, the older generation fills their chests with night rain and sink; luckily old friends are still everywhere I look, allowing only the richness of spring to be stored in my heart. (Those at the same table were Du Heying, Wu Changtian, Jian Huajing, and Shan Bainian.)</p>
<p>Two parts Liangfu, one part Sao, I personally received the words of the heavenly man in the azure sky. I refuse the worldly praises in狂言, why must I commit myself to Gao Tao? (Du He spoke about the art of living, inspiring this reflection.)</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 401</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Yes, only five people were initially dispatched; after receiving the phone call, ten more were added… I didn't expect to have disturbed you, sir, I am truly sorry!" The old man apologized for the third time.</p>
<p>"Phone call?" Tsurumi expressed surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes, it was also a female comrade from our country who reported it by phone."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Tsurumi immediately thought of that woman at the Banzai Mansion.</p>
<p>"Then it seems my phone call was for nothing." Tsurumi added a hint of disappointment.</p>
<p>"Not at all;" the old man said with certainty, "this gave our comrade a chance to deliver a merciful message—since she can only borrow a phone outside the mansion, the mansion's phone cannot be used casually—so when your subordinate called, we could also hear the news."</p>
<p>"The old gentleman also has concerns about Miss Nakamura's disappearance..."</p>
<p>"I dare not;" the old man saw that Tsurumi's attitude had begun to change, seemingly lessening his depression; "upon hearing this unfortunate news, we have already mobilized all our manpower. But until now, we have not received any information. Alas!"</p>
<p>"Very good," Tsurumi took out his notebook, waved it slightly, and smiled, "The records here have probably been reviewed by the old gentleman. Most of it is written in code, so it may be difficult to understand, but at least some of it can be understood. Please remember: My temporary office is the International Hotel…"</p>
<p>"I already have it memorized!" The old man also showed a hint of a smile, while also expressing unease, "I only wanted to know a little about your identity and the nature of your position, so I took the liberty. But there was absolutely no intention of searching for your other secrets. In any case, I must ask for your forgiveness, because of the painful state of mind of our group..."</p>
<p>"I understand very well, and I am twelve times sympathetic, and I am willing to do all I can to cooperate with the old gentleman." Tsurumi suddenly stood up straight and shook the old man's hand.</p>
<p>This was an unexpected gain for Tsurumi, and also an unexpected gain for the old man. Just as the two were warmly shaking hands, Masae had already returned to the room:</p>
<p>"Captain, there is no news from the Banzai Mansion, but there is a person waiting there for the Captain, insisting on speaking with the Captain. As for the International Hotel, I have already given the instructions…"</p>
<p>"Very good, please make a trip to the Banzai Mansion," Tsurumi said, immediately taking out a business card, writing two sentences, and handing it to Masae, "This represents me personally. Please consider the situation of the person who came, either dismiss them on the spot or bring them to the hotel to see me."</p>
<p>At this time, wine and food had already been laid out on the rectangular table in the room.</p>
<p>"To express our sincere apologies, on behalf of our country, I offer a toast to the two of you." The old man personally handed over two glasses of wine.</p>
<p>Masae drank a glass and hurriedly left. Tsurumi talked with the old man for a few minutes, and the old man sent two of his subordinates to escort Tsurumi.</p>

<h3>Gandhi's Fast</h3>
<p>— A Lin</p>
<p>As far as I can remember, Gandhi has fasted more than once for the Indo-Muslim conflict. According to a recent Associated Press report, he will fast again if riots occur again in the villages of 　Jialuo. I remember that in a fast that occurred several years ago because of conflicts in the All-India independence movement, it lasted as long as twenty or thirty days, barely continuing with only fruit juice. People generally worried that this old man, who at first glance was as thin as a rake and seemed to have no fat at all, would fast to death. In the end, it was a miracle that this old man ultimately lived through the end of his fast. However, already at an advanced age, his physical condition today absolutely does not allow him to fast again. No wonder the people of India feel increasingly worried when the news arrives.</p>
<p>From Gandhi, one is reminded of the Cynics of Greece. This ascetic is probably the only remaining standard of human morality in the world today. His restraint is further demonstrated by sleeping with his wife's daughter not long ago. However, this is ultimately a virtue from the spinning wheel era. Just like his spinning wheel and his concepts, his conduct cannot exert force in today's society.</p>
<p>Gandhi and the Indian independence movement are inseparable, but he is quite distant from today's India. Although his fasting and suffering show his whole personality, it is not enough to save the current world. That is why Nehru today can only respect him but not follow him, and it is up to him.</p>
<p>The pursuit of freedom and the reform of society probably cannot be done simply as ideological changes in behavior. The conflict between India and the Muslims will naturally not end because of Gandhi's fast. We hope that the riots in Bengal will not become a reality. No matter what, Gandhi's existence is still a symbol of humanity and peace in this world.</p>
<h3>Professor Arthur's Farewell Concert — On the 20th at the Lyceum Theatre</h3>
<p>— Pei Lin</p>
<p>The famous violin expert Professor Arthur is about to leave Shanghai and return to Vienna, in the United States. Many music lovers in this city who admire him will have the opportunity to hear his last farewell concert at the Lyceum Theatre this month on the 20th (Sunday) at 5:30 pm. The great program that evening, in addition to Brahms' "Sonata" and Mendelssohn's "Concerto," includes major works by famous musicians such as Saxe, Szymanowski, Shkota, and Sarasate. It will certainly have a grand effect. The piano accompaniment will be provided by the famous Austrian pianist Professor Marcos.</p>
<p>I remember that Professor Arthur fled to Shanghai eight years ago, in 1939, from Vienna, which was under the oppression of the Nazi regime. After experiencing many hardships, he was gradually recognized by the music community in Shanghai, and was finally hired as the principal violinist of the Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra and professor of violin at the National Conservatory of Music. In the past, he often performed many great concertos with the accompaniment of the symphony orchestra, fully demonstrating the extraordinary nature of his technique. He also has a unique interpretation of chamber music. During these eight years, which are neither long nor short, he has indeed captured a group of listeners who admire him, and at the same time trained a group of excellent young disciples. Therefore, his sudden decision to return home is truly a regrettable thing for the Chinese music community, which has few talents. We believe that this farewell concert, in indescribable emotions, will certainly reap unexpected grandeur and success. Tickets for the concert are on sale at the Lyceum Theatre and the Mottelee Music Store at the same time.</p>
<h3>Lending at High Interest Rates</h3>
<p>— Ji Shui</p>
<p>It is said that lending at high interest rates is currently the most profitable, but this is not entirely the case.</p>
<p>I had a colleague with the same surname as me. At that time, people called him Old Zhou, and me Little Zhou. In the first half of last year, Old Zhou retired and received a retirement bonus of more than two million yuan. He settled in Hangzhou with his only son and made a living by lending at high interest rates. He could earn three to four hundred thousand yuan each month, which was more cost-effective than being a company commander in the army, so he was quite comfortable.</p>
<p>But recently, a friend in Hangzhou wrote to me saying: "Old Zhou has changed careers again. He has become a smuggler. The reason is that he wants to smoke, and his son wants to study. Although the interest is still being charged and the income is still the same, prices have risen; in terms of hoarding goods, two million yuan now is less than one-third of what it was when he received it. So Old Zhou panicked and quickly abandoned his 'sitting and eating' plan, and changed to 'traveling and eating.'"</p>
<p>It is true that lending at high interest rates is profitable, but prices are like the target elevators in the Great World Company. It rolls upward, and you run downward. Its speed far exceeds yours. Even if you run until you sweat, you are still on it. What can you do!</p>
<p>But Old Zhou's dream of high interest rates has been shattered. When his dream of being a smuggler is also shattered in the future, what will he do then?</p>

<h3>Making Friends with the Prime Minister's Son</h3>
<p>— Jin Jie</p>
<p>I am a squad leader in the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department. On the night of the 13th, I was ordered to work on the Blue Funnel Line's Calchas ship. This morning, I read Shen Bao and learned that Prime Minister's son Martin Edley was on the same ship as me. I found the clerk and asked him to introduce me. As a result, we met in his bedroom. He was very polite and offered me a cigarette. He said, "How did you know my name?" I showed him today's Shen Bao. The other two sailors who shared the bedroom with Martin, upon seeing the Prime Minister艾's photo, insisted on taking this newspaper back to England as a souvenir. We sat down and talked. Martin Edley said, "Everyone should learn real skills in their youth, so it will not be difficult to be a ship owner in the future. Many Chinese reporters came to the ship to see me yesterday, but some were not allowed to meet me by the shipowner because we were too young." We talked until about 11 o'clock. He said, "We will play soccer this afternoon. I feel extremely tired now." I took out my duty book and asked him to sign it as a souvenir. He signed his name with his left hand, and said, "I hope to see you again next time." I then left his bedroom. I think our Chinese youths should not take their status too seriously and should also learn some specialized knowledge like Martin Edley.</p>
<p>Sir: I have written poorly. Please correct it, and I have attached his signature. Respectfully to the Free Talk Editor</p>

<h3>Sinful Pleasure</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>—Thoughts from the Popular Songs of the City</p>
<p>Whether it is day or night, when we pass through a bustling city, we can always hear those popular songs lingering on the streets. What "Darling, darling! My beloved enemy:" What "Hurry to find a passionate lover," What "Oh my darling! Is your love true?"... In short, these new songs that people sing and enjoy are only full of sensuality and carnality, making people feel lightheaded!</p>
<p>I have a friend who came from Shanghai and stayed in a hotel for three days. When he returned to the countryside, he said to me, "Shanghai has not made any other progress, except for advertising, which is quite developed."</p>
<p>"How do you say that?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That can be seen from the sound and color that is expressed in this city today. All the sounds and colors do not represent the culture of this city, but are only used as a way to attract advertisements."</p>
<p>That's right, Shanghai has not made any progress, except for sound and color. The popular songs sung in dance halls, shops, and teahouses, and the neon lights and mercury lights that are installed are the representative works of sound and color in this city. And the creation and design of these sounds and colors has indeed taken some ingenuity, so that the people in this city can fall into the net of his sounds and colors, become intoxicated, and never wake up!</p>
<p>Everyone will linger and forget to return to the pleasure of sound, color, dogs, and horses, not to mention that drinking tea, chatting, eating melon seeds, and listening to storytellers are praised as the traditional artistic life of the Chinese people? But we want to ask, is this kind of real life considered a cultural creation of ours? Or can it enrich the country and strengthen the people, and even assimilate foreigners in the future? If not, if we continue to sing and enjoy ourselves like this, are we not afraid of having a day when our voices change and our colors fade?</p>
<p>The high and low of sound, the stimulation and harmony of color, can represent the living conditions of a nation, as well as its emotions and thoughts. The Marseillaise has completed the victory for the French Revolution, and the "Drizzling Rain" era has caused many young people to commit suicide by throwing themselves into the river. Therefore, becoming a kind of artistic life is not about transcending reality to create a selfish, selfless state; but about shouldering the responsibilities of the era, and moving forward with both sorrow and joy. The opposite of serious work is not licentiousness. This should be understood by artists. Go away, those decadent sounds! Those colors that make people drunk! In these days of national suffering, we want to live in tragic and solemn sounds and colors, which can strengthen the atmosphere of our lives.</p>
<h3>Unchanging Heart</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Doctor: "How is his heart doing?"</p>
<p>Nurse: "Very good, very good."</p>
<p>Doctor: "How so?"</p>
<p>Nurse: "He has proposed to me twice already."</p>
<h3>Speed Up</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Tourist (to the driver of the family he is staying with): "Don't let me miss this bus."</p>
<p>Driver: "Don't worry, sir. Madam said that if you don't catch this bus, she will fire me."</p>
<h3>Reflections on Huibinlou — Remembering Tian Shouchang</h3>
<p>— Lin Weizhong</p>
<p>Last month, on the 13th, so many friends celebrated Shouchang's birthday, so many friends and young people, as well as our relatives and friends, came to participate in that grand celebration. I am so grateful and so happy. But in the midst of happiness, there are still countless tears. Even when I saw Mr. Pan Gongzhan and Mr. Tang San, whom he knew, I did not go out to greet them. As the saying goes: "A pair of small feet, a jar of tears." From the Republic of China year 13 to now, I don't know how many jars of tears I have shed for him.</p>
<p>I remember one autumn evening sixteen years ago, he used Tian Minggao, and I used Lin Qingzhen, which were both our childhood names. We sent out a hundred large red invitations and invited more than a dozen tables of guests at Huibinlou. Almost all the old friends in the cultural, film, and theater circles were there. Old Mr. Yan Gongshang spoke in various dialects, and Mr. Liu Yazi even wrote a poem. Ms. Cai Wen, Hong Dou, and Hu Ping, and other friends sang songs and performed plays. In short, although Huibinlou at that time was much more lively than it is now, it was far from comparable to today. Today's Huibinlou has not only changed its facade and been repainted completely, but the personnel have also changed. At that time, Mr. Tang Louqiu was the host, and we went and returned together. Now, Mr. Hong Shen is the chief greeter. Before the banquet was over, I heard him say to Shouchang, "The car is here, boss, you and Hong Zhen will leave first." I was alone, all alone, returning to my residence in the vast darkness, inevitably thinking back and forth. Living to this age, I have become incomprehensible to myself!</p>
<p>I often ask myself: What is called "life"? I'm just having an empty dream!</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>July 3rd of the Same Year</p>
<p>The nameplate on the door of Room 306 of the Lequn Society reads Mr. Liu, but in reality, it is the headquarters of Zhu Xinong, the red-nosed associate manager of the China Tea Company.</p>
<p>Today, the importance of this room is simply no less than that of the Pacification Commissioner's Office on Guixi Road. From early morning until 10 o'clock, more than twenty groups of guests have come one after another, and there have been more than ten phone calls. Old Zhu is using various methods, either soft, hard, polite, or arrogant, to deal with them, and he himself feels particularly great. His guests are almost all here for the sake of freight cars. Some hope to ride along with the people, others hope to ride along with the goods; except for very few one or two people who have letters from bigwigs like Commander Li and Minister Bai, wanting to use their power to force their way in, the rest are prepared to pay money and are determined to take a heavy hit from him. As long as he agrees to let their goods or people get on the truck, no matter how high the price, they are willing to pay.</p>
<p>Old Zhu keeps stroking his red nose, feeling quite complacent.</p>
<p>But there is one thing that makes him feel not so satisfied, and that is that the attitude of those truck drivers is really too bad. He has already discussed with Team Leader Chen, who is in charge of the trucks, and plans to use a method of circulating every other stop to use six trucks as twelve or even eighteen trucks. This way, he estimates that he can make at least one or two thousand yuan. But those drivers seem to be as clever as he is, and they have put forward various demands, making it difficult for him to cope.</p>
<p>He lay on the rattan chair by the bed, slowly drinking the fourth bottle of fresh orange juice that the waiter had just brought in, looking out the window, and thinking about how to replace the driver who spoke the rudest.</p>
<p>On the bed, leaning against the inside, was the very bored Jin Aili. When Old Zhu was talking to people about buying freight car shares, she had no chance to interrupt at all. She wanted to go out alone, but she was afraid of making Old Zhu suspicious. The only way left was to lean on the bed and sit like a clay sculpture, or occasionally think about many unrelated things.</p>
<p>The room had been quiet for only five or six minutes when the door was pushed open again by a new guest.</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Zhu." Old Zhu and Jin Aili shouted almost at the same time. Jin Aili even immediately stood up from the bed. The air of an associate manager is of course different. He only accompanied them with smiles, nodding repeatedly, without personally standing up to offer them a seat.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian was as usual, smiling slyly, and his mouth seemed to be holding a large piece of unfinished candy. (49)</p>
