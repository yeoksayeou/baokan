<h3>美眾院軍事小組委會　促迅速援助我國　並主早日對日簽訂和約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿一日廣播：華盛頓訊，美衆院軍事小組委會今日提出一報吿書，主張早日與日本簽訂和約，並希望在日本保留海軍根據地三處。該小組曾由共和黨議員柯爾率領遊歷世界各地。該報吿書中提出下列各點：　以更多與更迅速之援助給予中國政府。　派遣美國軍事代表團訓練希臘軍隊。　發展特魯克島作爲太平洋之一大海軍根據地。　加强關島之軍事設施。　保留琉球羣島作爲美國之軍略基地。　增加珍珠港之儲油量，俾在戰爭一旦發生之時，可供一年之用。該報吿中力促與日本簽訂和約，並在和約簽訂後，美軍即可自日本撤退。報吿中雖未直接指出蘇聯之名，但謂：苟任何一國表示反對，則美國可能採取單獨行動　惟在美軍撤退時，須由聯合國接管日本。該小組認爲日本係最使彼等滿意之地區，對美軍佔領當局之作爲與夫日本人之合作能度備致讀揚。渠等謹爲美國之注意力集中歐洲而忽視中國，實屬一「悲劇性之錯誤」。並促使杜魯門總統注意此點，主張以更多之軍需品及訓練人員給予中國政府。報吿書中承認中國政府有貪汚行爲，但較諸在中國成立一對美仇視之政府爲佳。苟中國落入共產主義之掌握，對美國不能無所影　，最後將使遠東太平洋各地均爲共產主義所吞沒。</p>
<h3>美報主軍火援華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿一日電〕紐約每日鏡報廿一日社評譴賣「自一九二四年起蘇聯支持中國內戰至今」，並支持甚至在對日作戰期內亦與中國政府作戰之中共軍隊。社評指出，羅斯福曾圖使蔣主席與中共永久聯合，杜魯門及馬歇爾「仍在德黑蘭。雅爾達及波茨坦之暗影下」，亦企圖造成合作。「蔣主席則予以拒絕，蓋渠明知中共與蘇聯勾結係祖國之奸賊，自一九二〇年後亦已如此，馬歇爾之調停幾乎毁滅中國，蓋調停造成美國鼓勵共產之影象，而加強中共之力量。吾人停運一切軍火往中國，而蘇聯繼續資助中共，同時，太平洋區大量軍備日益腐爛，如蔣主席能有此軍備，可以大有作爲——此乃合理實際之援助。然美國以千萬金元援助歐洲，對此則一字不提，或許因此種援助不費淺之故，或許因美國政府心目中之援外，乃使美國人民蒙受慘重之犧牲」</p>
<h3>沛縣棗莊收復　徐州昨起縮短戒嚴時間隴海路徐鄭段已無匪縱</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿一日電〕徐州外圍已恢復常態，廿一日起戒嚴時間縮短，自下午十時戒嚴次晨七時解嚴。隴海路徐鄭沿綫現已無匪蹤，國軍正掩護修路，並分路淸剿鐵路南北散匪。沛縣自衛隊廿日下午四時收復沛縣城，劉匪十一縱隊竄獲縣北陳莊。亭台集，金鄕城仍由國軍固守。陳毅一。三。六。從隊殘部竄永城渦陽中間地區，國軍正追剿中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕魯南進駐縣後，續向北追剿，國軍廿日午將裴山附近匪匪擊潰，並即攻克棗莊。</p>
<h3>主席書面答外記者問　世界和平工作艱钜　我籌備實施行憲已將完成</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿一日電〕蔣主席廿一日用書而答覆聯合社記者提出之問題構：欲謀世界和平，誠爲一最艱鉅之工作。余確信聯合國機構之成立，可以逐漸完成天下一家之人類最高理想，此爲廿世紀一個最重要之進步。几改善人類情形之任何事業，常然須經過許多艱苦試騐，聯合國謀致世界和平，在早期內遇到種種困難，化固不足爲怪。但余深信各會員國如能以整個世界幸福爲目標，而置本國利益於其下，則必能由互提諒解，互相努力，而使目前所有困難獲得最後解決。關於舉行大選準備實施憲政一事，主席宣稱：我人籌備此重大事件，已將完成，務須全國努力，在各方面加速進行。我人今日之任務，較諸戰時未見减輕，其環境之困難亦並不减少，但余誠意希望全體人民均將增加決心，以掃除妨害國家早日完成復興計劃之一切障礙。民主政治的基本條件即爲法治，當然，政府官吏之一切行動。皆應根據法律，但人民亦應學習習守法，惟有如此，民卞制度方有健全永久之茶礎。聯合社記者共提出五項問題，主席答覆其二，對餘者不願表示意見。</p>
<h3>遠東委會討論盟國賠償要求我促開和會建議尙未討論</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿日電〕遠東委會廿日舉行常會時，並未討論我國所提「請遠東委會十一會員國從速舉行對日和會初步會議」之建議案。據權威方面稱：遠東委會刻尙不宜討論中國之建議，今日會中所討論者，爲盟國向日本之賠償要求，日本工業標準等較爲專門之問題。據美國務院官員告記者稱：中國政府送致美方重申召開初步對日和會建議之照會，科仍在國務院「積極考慮中」。國務院迄今尙未答覆中國政府。</p>
<p>〔聯合社　協頓廿一日電〕今日據悉：此間各國人士誤認太平洋盟國對於日本賠償問題業在遠東委員會中陷於僵局一節，昨夜已因美國向該會提出賠償比例新方案而吿局部澄淸。美國同時籲請遠東委員會各委員轉請本國政府爲盟國共同幸福計，接受該項建議，藉以解除日本工商恭復興主要障礙。權威人士聲稱：若干國蒙表示願意接受美國新方案俾駐日佔領軍當局得能立即開始執行賠償工作。但新方案內容如何，現尙嚴守秘密，僅知中國所占百分比一向最高，今後殆有顯著消減。至於菲律賓本占賠償總數百分之十五。或將保持不變，此點菲律賓政府料可接受。此外，原來百分比總數約當日本賠償物資百分之二百，聞將修改爲百分之一百，遠東委員會並希望在一二星期內接獲關係各國政府之答復，庶幾屆時有所決定。</p>
<h3>京平各界慶祝第八屆防空節</h3>

<h3>法國向那里去？</h3>
<p>在美國國會正在召開特別會議，考應援歐緊急計劃的時候，默陸的局勢，却益趨動　不寗。法義兩國各地，均有罷工騷動情事的發生。在法國，賴瑪迪政府終於支持不住而遭到了傾擾，勃魯姆於是以社會黨的元老，復腐組閣之任。與追消息同時傳來的，還有法國總統召回十四萬新兵之命。在動盪不安的法國局勢下，法總統一面付勃魯姆以組閣之任，一面召回新兵爲必要的軍事措施，足見注國當前的局勢似乎確甚危急，此次勃魯姆以七十五歲的高齡，不辭勞瘁，重組新閣，其精神固至可佩；然其對於今後法國的局勢，能否收到安定的預期效果，要爲舉世人士所關心</p>
<p>法國局勢之所以日趨動盪，終致賴瑪迪內閣不能不吿解體，此中原因，本非單純。就直接的及最近的一面看，法國全國近爲澎湃的工潮所席捲，馬賽等地且曾演出罷工流血事件，賴瑪迪內閣窮於應付，於是不得不宣吿辭職。然而法國的工潮，與其說是雇主與雇員之間的爭執，實母寗說是一種政治鬥爭，其目的不僅在獲得較高的酬報和較好的待遇，實在與政府爲難，顯然是一種鬥爭的政治行動。此種運動的發生，多少爲「法國人民聯盟」在此次法國市選中贏得了空前大勝利的反應，共目的在各處發動變亂，使一般秩序陷於混亂，以企圖達成獲得政權的目的；卽此目的不能達成，至少亦可以造成一時的恐怖，徐圖發展。這顯然是一種有計劃的行動，無疑地，注國的共產黨是從中在策劃着的。</p>
<p>這一運動的產生，固與戴高樂所領導的「法國人民聯盟」在市選中的獲勝，不無關係。而「法國人民聯盟」之獲勝，又與法國共產黨不無關係。大戰以後，法國共產黨的聲勢益大，儼然以法國第一政黨自居；然而以皮杜爾外長爲領導的「人民共和運動」，亦以新政黨的姿態，出現於法國，爲人民所擁戴，形成了法國政治的左右兩翼。過去法國政局之所以能夠維持，便由於中間政黨如社會黨者，能夠運用時機，偏左偏右，以爲調劑。賴瑪迪內閣便是以中間政黨爲中心，而附以右翼的「人民共和運動」。然而在「人民共和運動」，因「法國人民聯盟」的勝利，已無復昔日廣大羣衆的今日，賴瑪迪內閣之必將遭遇難關，原爲意想中事。我們一考戴高樂所領導的「注國人民聯盟」之所以能夠在市選中獲得大勝，其直接原因，便由於法國並產黨的出賣祖國，加入了以「共產黨情報局」的姿態而出現的新的共產國際，甘爲莫斯科的御用政團。自一共產黨情報局一的宣言出，提高了法國人民的警覺，終由於此警覺，而使戴高樂所領導的政團在市選中獲得了勝利。法國人民爲了他們的祖國，將他們的希望寄托在戴高樂上。</p>
<p>戴高樂所領導的政團在市選中獲得了空前的勝利，使法國政局立刻改觀。外長皮社爾所領導的「人民共和運動」的廣大羣衆，固己多數更向右轉，加入到「法國人民聯盟」去了；就是向爲法國共產黨所控制，擁有會員六百萬的法國總工會也發生了分裂運動，轉而傾向「法國人民聯盟」。在今日，此一政團，無疑地，是受着多數注國人民擁戴的。戴高樂的剛愎自用，原爲法國人民所習知，但「注國人民聯盟」却代表一種新興的勢力，雖以戴高樂爲領袖，其中堅份子，多爲不滿於共產黨的前其淤黨員，如名作家馬爾拉就是。「法國人民聯盟」的勝利，表示法國政局向右轉的趨勢，愈益顯明。在這種情勢下，我們看見有勃魯姆的出而担常起組閣的重任。</p>
<p>勃魯姆如果組閣成功，無疑地，必將是一個過渡政府，問題是，過波到那裹？右翼的「法國人民聯盟」擁有　大的　眾是事實，明年國會改　可能獲得勝利，亦或在意計之中。但勃魯姆內閣是否將過渡給戴高樂，遝有待以後的事寶來證　。我們不會忘記當共產國際決定的組織「人民陣綫」的時候，勃後姆便是「人民陣綫」政府的曾領；他同共產黨原是有淵源的。目前法國的政局與昔日的不同，共產黨所處的地位亦不同，勃魯姆是否能改變他向來的態度，我門無從知悉。但據報載消息，勃魯姆之出組政府，似爲對擁有偉大潛勢力的「法國人民聯盟」的一種打擊。蓋所謂中間黨內部亦有兩派，一爲勃魯姆領導者，主張設立使戴高樂無法恢復秉政之政府；另一派則主張設立一過渡性之政府，以爲現政府與明年初戴高樂政府間之過渡機構，一度傳擬組閣而失敗，現傳爲勃魯姆內閣之副揆的萊諾，卽爲此派之領袖。如今勃魯姆旣出而組府，似乎不能不說是對「法國人民聯盟」的一種打擊。</p>
<p>要之，自戴高樂派在市選中獲勝後，法國政局虫的左右鬥爭，益　尖銳，已頻於內戰的邊緣。中間黨的勃魯姆以避免內戰出而組閣，究竟內戰是否避免了，抑反而加緊左右兩派的鬥爭，促成內戰，則有待於中間政黨特別是像勃魯姆這樣的人物的如何自處。我們願中間政黨真能發揮出調劑左右的作用來。</p>
<h3>朱家驊報吿敎育設施</h3>
<p>（上接一版）朱氏首述各地學潮漸趨平定，渠分析學潮起因，寶由於青年情緒不安，覆因遭受生活壓迫，乃致對現象煩悶。繼稱：復員以後，敎育首要工作，爲恢復戰前狀態，但因八年抗戰，國家損失重大，敎育復員，極感困難，例如：學校房屋缺乏，事寶上不易於短期恢復，加之學生人數倍增，各校容量更感不敷。朱氏　述及教職員待遇及學生公費，均己逐漸提高，毋如因物價液動影響，生活仍感艱困，現研究費已自最初之五百元增至百萬元，專科以上學校敎負底　最　高額，亦己提高至六百元，至學生公費原爲戰時臨時辦法，政院業已決定取消，並代之以獎學金，然原有公費生則仍予保留，政府爲顧全貧苦學生，復另設救濟金，籍以敎濟匪區青年學子。朱氏認爲，　書儀器之缺乏，亦爲敎育不安原因之一。渠稱：各校設備確實太差，敎部雖壓次請求外匯，爲各校添加設備，然爲數究屬有限，戰時美對我貨款，曾撥一部作爲學校購置之用，現所購物品，已陸續送到。此外，敎部並在英。美募書二三十萬册，內容雖不甚隹，但不無小補。又聯敎組織分配我國之書籍數百箱，其中有若干部大英百科全書，最近即可寄到。戰時被日本刻去之　書，現經查出者，均已運回。朱氏繼就國際文化合作救濟流亡學生及敎科書等問題，分別作一概括之報吿。渠最後稱：本學期開學以來，各校情形爲想像不到之安定，最近浙大稍有不安，仍係共黨造成，現于子三案己由法院宣判，當可吿一段落。朱氏强調敎育必須走上安定之路，蓋敎育爲百年大計，敎育不安，影響政治，時局不安，亦可影響敎育。</p>

<h3>法政局千鈞一髮勃魯姆斥黨危害民主要求採取中間主義路線</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦　一日廣播：巴黎訊，法國社會黨　宿勃魯姆於今日下午三時出　國民義會，精神　　，頗具自信心。渠將要求國民議會投信任藥。勃氏當即發表演說稱：國際共產主義已向法國民主政治公開宣戰。渠希望組織一新的中間性政府，團結全國愛好共和制度之人民，以防止左右兩派任何一方面之獨裁，並形成一「國際第三勢力」，籍以制止西方國家與蘇聯在世界各地之益趨分裂。吾人猶如若干歐洲國家，不願參加任何陣營，唯安定是求。法國之任務，乃在形成此種國際中間勢力，以减輕國際間之誤解與猜疑云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿一日電〕在全國七十餘萬工人罷工之下，法國局勢已置於極度緊張中，現舉世矚目於七十五歲之勃魯姆氏如何領導法國渡過此嚴重危機。勃魯姆二十一日已與各重要政治領袖開始談判企圖組織一强有力而又可被接受之政府。觀察者認爲勃氏成功與失敗之機會參半。二十日政府召十五萬後備軍人入伍，　認爲此乃政府決心以武力維持法律與程序，以及必要時以武力打擊罷工之表示。據各報戰：政府方面已獲悉共黨已動員全國黨員，以備可能在週末有所行動，此項報吿尙未經官方證實。然共黨確曾向民衆數發煽勸性之手册，號召「聯合與行動」，使共黨統治法國，並呼簽在各地「組織保衛共和，保衛工業農業與國家獨立之委員會」。共黨指稱勃魯姆爲戴高樂與「美帝國主義者」之「工具」。</p>

<h3>共黨鐵蹄下人民遲早掙脫鎖鏈胡佛暢論「兩個世界」</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿日電〕美前總統胡佛今夜在此間荷蘭協會年宴中發表演說稱，余不能不信共產黨鐵蹄下之人民遲早將掙脫其鎖鍊。一再淸黨實足證明共黨控制區城之不安情形。第五縱隊正在全世界活動，必須不斷加以對付。蘇聯及共產主義乃世界前途之巨大黑影。吾人現正分成兩個世界，其一保持無神主義，欲奴化人類，另一保持宗敎信仰，主張人類自由。西半球各國正昭示：自由企業乃增產之唯一途徑，今日僅有自由企業各國，可免飢寒之患。運往海外救濟歐亞全部物資中，百分之九十五來自自由企業國家之巨大生產。假令西半球亦順從東歐西歐之經濟的烏托邦，余敢調將無一噸麥物或煤塊運往國外。</p>

<h3>錫蘭獨立案英下院二讀辯論</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕下院今日二讀辯論錫蘭獨立法案。殖民部大臣瓊斯謂此一法案乃殖民史上重要的記程碑，使錫蘭人民可因此進入自治領之地位，取得充分之自治權，此案同時亦可表示英國與錫蘭人民間之互相信任及善意。瓊斯並曰，英國於一百年來，力圖在各殖民地建立完善的經濟基礎，以爲政治制度之所據，近年來民族思想蓬勃，英國則從事誘導此等思想入於建設性之途徑，助其負起對於本身事務更大的責任。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕馬歇爾今日行前會訪前國務卿貝爾納斯，談約一小時半，此事引起衆人揣測。蓋以貝氏曾主張蘇聯如繼續阻撓外長會議獲致協議，西方各國應與德國單獨締結和約。但馬氏是否贊成此種主張，無論其本人或其他官員均未明言。杜魯門總統曾親至機塲送別，祝其此去諸事順利。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二十日電〕外部發言人稱，皮杜爾外長下週一啓程赴倫敦參加週二開始舉行之外長會議時，携有關於德國之四點計劃，即　依聯邦基礎改組德國；　德國之經濟統一；　魯爾區眞正的管制；　薩爾之併入法國經濟制度。外部發言人認爲外界對於本屆外長會議過份悲觀，蓋此次會議之失敗，尙非必然之事。法國不擬犧牲歐洲安全之絕對需要，因此當堅持前述之四點。法國並將建議設專家委會，以調査於完成重建德國之經濟統一後，如何可使提取賠償物資與平衡德國國際收支不致衝突。法國堅決反對爲提取賠償而提高德國之工業水準，換言之，即法國決不重賠償而忽略歐洲之安全。</p>
<h3>奥油廠被沒收事蘇拒絕英美抗議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十日電〕外交部今日宣稱：美英兩國前對蘇聯沒收奥地利羅堡煉油廠及其設備作爲賠償一節，提出抗議，已遭蘇聯政府拒絕，此事或將提交下週外長會議討論。羅堡煉油廠在奥地利規模最大，係英美投資合營，一九三八年德奥合併後，爲德方佔據，嗣經蘇聯沒收，認爲該項油田乃德商所有，視作德國財產處理。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦分治新方案英聲明拒絕接受反對逐步移轉政權辦法</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖三十日電〕英政府於今日拒絕聯大巴勒斯坦委會分治小組建議之於渦渡時期將巴勒斯坦行政交聯合國委員會負責之議。英代表賈德幹吿巴勒斯坦委會稱，過渡期內英國旣尙握有委治之權，故英政府不允在巴勒斯坦有雙重的當局。平時縱在案定政局之下，政機之重複，尙且爲危險之現象，在巴勒斯坦顯然將有嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>故英政府不得不鄭重聲明，在英國繼續握有委治　之期間，英政府當堅持在巴勒斯坦由其行使不可分的管制權。賈德幹復聲明，英政府不能等待安理會之撤銷其在巴勒斯坦之委治，英政府不能接受小組會建議之自委治常局至臨時政府委員會之逐步移轉政權辦法，而巴勒斯坦當局亦不允在其控制區內有任何足以促赴動亂之活動。賈德幹並聲明英國準備參加執行得爲猶阿同時接受之解決辦法的程度，前已由英殖民大臣瓊斯詳爲釋明。賈德幹述畢，會義席上分治小組之各委員均呈驚愕之態，蓋賈氏之聲明顯然業已推翻分治小組所擬之若干重要計劃。分治小組主席波蘭之普魯辛斯基立即建議改期舉行會議，以便各代表得請示本國政府，旋即決定改期星期一下午繼續開會。</p>

<h3>國代選舉第一日　投票約五六十萬　全市投票秩序多良好</h3>
<h3>市長投票選舉議長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞吳市長於昨晨入時二十分，親赴常熟區第四投票听（肇光中學）投票選舉潘公展議長爲國大代表。</p>
<p>﹝本報訊〕昨日淸晨八時，全市各工廠汽笛長嗚，我國歷史上首次國大代表投票，於焉開始。投票分別在二百六十個投票所進行，市民均能度沉靜，依法選舉，並未影響其日常生活。各候選人在此決定時機，仍努力爭取票數，宣傳車輛沿途疾馳，精緻印刷品大量奉送，形成大選中之顯著景象。各投票所開始工作之時間並不一致，人口築中之地區自八時起即有人陸續投票，地點較僻靜者至九時許尙門庭冷落。至昨晚七時，選舉事務所已接獲各報吿，投票者以郊區較爲踴躍，龍華區投票選民在二萬人以上。市區投票反不如理想之衆多，推測其原因，大致因昨日非假期，大部市民均坐辦公室，無暇投票，今明兩日投票人數可能激增。據有關人員於午後四時許巡視區域投票後估計：昨日投票所最高有四千票，最低亦達一千票，估計投票者當佔選民總數二成左右，約爲五六十萬人。各投票地點均有相當警衛，全日除少數地區略有糾紛外，餘均秩序井然。</p>
<p>潘議長昨晨十時二十分，偕夫人廣冠玉女士，親往海格路中央攝影廠之靜安區第七投票所參加投票，出示選舉權證後，經管理員核對應在古拔路第六投票所投票，潘氏當又偕夫人改赴第六投票所，蓋章領取選票，於十時三十五分完成投票手續。選票上，潘氏與夫人供親筆書明「金振玉」三字。</p>
<h3>區民要求補領選證敎員身畔搜出空票</h3>
<p>昨日選舉中發生秩序問題者，約有下列各地：　北四川路第十七區於上午九時半左右，有未領得選舉權證之選民三百餘人，包圍區公所，要求補領。旋由區公所辦事人員出面洽商，由選民中推出代表傅長淸孫文炳說明理由，略謂該區第二十保，第八保，第十四保，及第十六保均未發足，保甲長事先旣未通知領票，而居民前往領票時，如屬知識程度較低者，亦往往不得要領，故耍求明瞭發票實際情形，並補發選舉權證。至十一時許副區長邱希聖來區公所，說明因選民領票不熱心而引起之種種困難，並允將選民代表之意見轉陳民政局。此事至午後即獲解決，由選民自携本人之國民身份證補領選舉權證。　北站第五投票所於上午十一時，忽有一年僅十二三之幼童闖入，高呼擁護顧錦藻爲國大代表。警員以其破壊秩序，囑令退出。此時人業中忽有一虹口天雯小學之樓姓教員出而干涉整察行動，警士以其形跡可疑，加以盤問搜査，當在身畔搜出空白選舉票七十二張之多，均爲向學生卷屬處設法取得者。因有背選舉法規，已送警局訊辦。　新涇第四投票所，於午後三時半，因秩序不佳，曾暫停投票半小時，至四時起恢復？</p>
<h3>民政局解釋　選舉　權證　問題</h3>
<p>其他投票所中，亦不乏因選民領不到選舉權證，而與保幹事發生爭執之事端。選民指責保中故意不發選舉權證，而保幹事則謂選民往往並不自帶私章至保辦公處領取，保辦公處又祗有幹事一人，自不能爲保內數百戶分送選舉權證。惟據民政局方面解釋，則謂民投票，分區域與職業兩種，分區保之戶口，如其屬於工商敎育及自由職業各界之人士，其選舉權證應向各該團體領取，在區保方面當先別除，一面重複投票之流弊。至於戶口或因移入未滿六個月，尙未向保甲塡報或未曾領取身份證，自亦不能塡發選舉權證，此亦爲各保甲領發選舉權證較少之一原因云。</p>
<h3>潘議長希望市府出佈告　機關廠校今日放假半天　市民對選舉冷漠有幾種原因</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊〕昨日一般投票情形，大體秧序良好，惟中外觀察家均有市民不免對選舉似形冷漠之感。其原因半田於此爲中國破天荒之全國普選，人民尙未習慣，半田於戰後生活艱困，物價高漲，人民忙於應付柴米油鹽，致少政治興趣。且選舉期限原有三天，昨爲第一日，而又未放假，大多數有職業之市民勢難分身前往投票。預料今日果期六卞午及明日星期日上午或可更見踴躍。聞潘議畏將向吳市長建議，今日星期六下下下下午佈吿各機關學校工廠放假半天，便利選民投票，（民主先進國家，大選時均放假），並將明日（廿三）星期日之投票截止期，延長至下午六時止，不知能獲市長之准許否。</p>
<h3>用公開合法手續投票　才是上海市民的光榮　議長在參議會電台廣播演講</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊〕市參議會潘議長，於昨晨特由京趕返本市，參加投票。上午十時半潘氏偕同夫人唐冠玉女士共赴富民路古拔公寓投票所投票。旋即赴市參議會電合作廣播演講，略稱：「各位同胞：今日爲中國國民行使其主人資格的選舉權的一天，不但上海市在今天舉行，全國各地亦正在熱烈地舉行。上海是全國的經濟文化中中中心，國際觀瞻所繁，希望上海市民對於這次選舉，一定要有美滿的表現。現在有三點意思向全市同胞說明：</p>
<p>希望都能親自投票　本市所有市民，凡是年滿二十歲，在本市居住滿六個月以上而取得戶籍的市民，都有選舉權，大家應該憑選舉權證，在今天起到二十三日中午止，這三天之內，隨時到規定的投票所去投票，不可放棄，亦不要規避。因爲選舉是國家主人的權利，但也是我們的責任。假定上海市有二百萬選民，則除了因病或其他迫不得已的情形，不能去投票的人而外，希望都能够親自去投他自己享有權利的一票。</p>
<p>方式應該絕對自由　在這三天內，選民舉行投票，方式應該是絕對自由公開，而且合法的；換言之，要在自由公開合法的手續之下投票，才是上海市民的光榮。我們不願看到有超越法律範圍以外的事情發生，更不願聽到有任何人用威脅的手段來挾持我們的選民或剝奪選民的選舉權。我們耍鼓勵所有候選人用公開光明的方法與合法的手段來競選，爭取市民的信任。假使選民不會寫字，只要你能報吿你所要選舉的人的姓名，儘可請人代書；設或代書人不肯代寫，或勸你放棄，或不照你的意思來寫，這都是不可以的。</p>
<p>絕不放棄自己權利　對次選舉，希望上海市能在各黨派和社會賢達公開的競選之下，收穫良好的成果。有包括了各方面的優良的國大代表，才能代表國民說要說的話，代表國民監督政府，保障憲法，選舉理想的大總統，使政府今後一切措施，的確走上民主的大道。國家在這新潮流中，一定要走上民主大道，從地方基層做起，才能成爲現代國家，永久保持其榮譽。我們希望政治消明，人民幸福，國家富强康樂，一定要大家重視這一次選舉，絕不放棄自己的權利！兄弟今晨特從南京趕回上海，目的就是來投我日己應投的一票。因爲這是一件十分鄭重的事情，假使大家以爲少他的一票不要緊，則投票所將門可羅雀，選舉的結果一定不能美滿，也就是表示市民不能熱心於國家大事，還不够做國家主人的資格。這不是一件很羞恥事情嗎？所以各位要明白選舉權輿各人的生命和財產一樣，應該是極其珍貴的。」</p>
<p>滬光戲院簡短演說潘氏講畢，即接獲嵩山區某市民來電話詢問選舉權證未能領到情形，當時即在廣播電台順便予以解釋。</p>

<h3>「黑貨」在貴州兩月間查獲運毒犯達一百五十八人</h3>
<p>〔本報貴陽十二日訊〕過去在四川的時候，就聞名貴州的「酸烟」，來筑兩月，究竟「酸烟」是什麼，還是說法不一。抗戰期中，在貴陽挺有名的是「鼎貨」，這「鼎貨」是什麼，我到知道，可是恕我未便隨說。一句話，抗戰期中，國家民族是那樣受苦難，禁烟案子交付軍法審判，動輒就是坐牢，槍弊，砍腦袋，貴州尙且有人敢以生命作賭注，去吸。運。售。種，何况勝利而從，禁烟案子已經移到　君子們公頌之爲「放生池」的法院去審判，生逢這種盛世，倘不大肆吸，運，售，種，那纔眞會彼犬下的壞君子們笑爲一等大優瓜哩！</p>
<h3>收購陳土製藥</h3>
<p>難迫說，貴州沒有推行禁政工作嗎？是又不然。我們中華民國遠在一八四○年還　「大淸帝國」的時候，就開始批行禁政了，一百零六年的禁烟歷史，不可謂不長，因禁烟而遭受的無比損失，不可謂不大，可惜禁者自禁，而吸者自吸，甚至禁民不禁官，禁你不禁我，禁的人就是犯的人，發財是目的，禁烟是手段，要不然，在抗戰期中，何以有「鼎貨」的傳戊？本年三月，何以有省參歲員詢問政府，爲什麽要把鴉片陳土五六百兩照官價收入賣送給私人製藥的事情發生呢！</p>
<p>我們根據官家文戲吧，本年三月舉行的省參議會，在省主席所作的施政報吿中，關於肅淸烟毒部份談到：「本省烟苗，年來査難甚嚴，莠民偸種區域，逐年减少，去年爲提前　淸烟毒起見，徑擬具「肅淸烟毒計劃」通令實施，並於去年九月嚴令各專員縣長澈底査　，十一月復派禁烟督察人員分往各區縣督同實地査勘。」結果如何呢！「除安龍，沿河，長順，册亨，畢節等五縣有極少數僻遠地區倫種，均立即鐘除外，其他各縣並無烟苗發現。」這是貴州省的禁種計劃與實施情形。</p>
<h3>運烟設館概況</h3>
<p>繼又談到運售烟毒及開設烟館的情形：「運售烟毒及開設烟館，仍飭由各縣市政府谷級警察機關會同憲兵隨時嚴密査緝」，所獲成果怎樣？「計自三十五年元月至十二月，共計查獲烟土五千四百八十一兩，烟　六兩一錢，烟灰一百三十七兩一錢，假土一千三百七十八兩五錢，（貴陽市警察局所破獲喻資訓等販運烟土四百二十四斤在外）又三十五年「六三」禁烟節各　焚燬烟具，共計烟槍二百九十一枝，烟燈三百一十七盞，共他　件二千七百零八件。」楊主席是一個「不吸紙姻不飮酒」的信徒，作事硬幹，究全軍人作風，他卞黔三年，對於政令推行，凡認爲必須貫澈到底者，常常有一句口頭語：「這件事，打仗都要得，我一定要幹。「他對於鴉片烟從小就憎恨，從軍從政，無不與鴉片爲敵，可是今日之貴州，仍是黑流洶湧，可見禁政之不易澈底推行了。</p>
<h3>黑流洶湧主因</h3>
<p>據記者調査與探詢結果，略有以下數因：　烟毒獲利，除了搶人綁票而外，任何經營趕不上鴉片烟生意，泯不長法的貪利之徒，密肯以生命作賭注，也不願與鴉片烟絕緣。　自從勝利而後，烟案由軍法審判移歸法院辦理，法院事事要講人證物　法律條文，一般與鴉片發生關係的人，無不認爲從此有了生路。　抗戰期中，政府頒佈的「禁烟禁毒治罪暫行條例」，雖會雷厲風行，勝利之後，或許政府認爲原條例洽罪太輕，遂予明令廢止，但新訂的又未與廢止的同時頒佈，遂使一般無知鄉民或者陳年老槍，誤會爲政府放業烟禁，不然，「治罪」條例何以廢止！　繼後頒行的「禁烟禁毒治罪條例」，其中所定的罰金最高額，爲一萬元，又使一般不明法令的無知鄉民與陳年老槍，不知道犯了烟禁有時會遭受自由刑與財產刑的「並科」治罪的，誤會爲只要照繳罰金最高額一萬元，即可依舊吞雲吐霧，樂而忘憂了。　貴州這地方，與鴉片烟有多年姻綠，加以鄰近各省如滇。桂。川。湘等省，對於鴉片烟也是極有興趣的地方，不但輸入源源不絕，且在犬牙交錯地方，互相競種，從未示弱，多年的風氣養成了他們認爲「不算犯法」的觀念。隨便那似地方，總有一些特殊勢力的人，這等人見超然於法律範圍之外的，可以任意吸，運，售，種，政府投鼠忌器，不便「過份」澈底，於是風行　偃，效尤日多。烟毒之難禁，難絕，難推行，豈徒貴州一省才如是？</p>
<h3>烟帮浩浩蕩蕩</h3>
<p>貴州省的鴉片烟運輸綫，主流是從雲南入口，雲南的鴉片，一般人稱爲「南土」，據說過　的程度，僅次於印度的「老人頭」而已。其次是貴州西南部，本省人稱爲盤江八屬的興仁，興義，以至安龍，興事，望漢。興義縣據說舊名「黃草壩」，那一帶地方所出的鴉片烟，一般人稱爲「壩土」，當然遠不如「南土」的色香味了。無論「南土」或「　土」，大抵都是沿滇黔公路而來貴陽，再由貴陽分散到東邊去湘西，北邊去川東。這條路上，隨車的，步行的，問關越卡的，眞是浩浩蕩蕩，生意興隆得很。老實說，在雲南和貴州西路一帶，據說，家中暗藏幾担鴉片烟，簡直不算希奇。</p>
<h3>獲利一倍有餘</h3>
<p>現在昆明的「南土」時價，每兩「纔」三十萬元左右，而且貨眞秤足，買賣大的客人，賣衆還可設法保送出境，只要到了貴陽，「南土」便可獲利一倍有多，（貴陽時價每兩七十萬元左右）體積不大，又無氣味，隨身携帶，極爲方便。所以貴陽南郊外三橋車站的「查緝烟毒聯合檢査所」，自開始嚴密査緝之日起，即自八月二十三日起至十月二十三日止，爲時不過兩月，他們就接接連連破獲運毒男女犯一百五十八名，査獲烟土三百一十七斤又二百五十八兩五錢。聽說湖南的芷江方面，最近査獲由貴陽去的烟土一批，竟達八百餘斤之多，數字之大，多麼驚人！</p>
<p>這批男女烟犯走私的技巧，眞是愈來愈新奇，普通用衣袋明目張胆的方式，大搖大擺若無其事的走過檢査站，這類烟犯多半是一些似軍人非軍人的傢伙幹的。</p>
<h3>女人騎馬走私</h3>
<p>至於女人們常用的一套，是「騎馬走私」挾帶在月經帶裏去撞關。有的是把烟土用油皮包好後，放在似乎不要緊的　子襄，或孩子們的貼肉衣服以及屎尿布內。如果是大宗走私，逃不了要藏在車胎，座廂，頂棚，油桶，或者　層皮箱裏面。也有利用不受檢査的大面子，混跡其問，安全穩妥的把大量烟土帶到目的地去。還有許多女烟犯，她們一身豪華，妝飾入時，儼然貴族夫人，大家閨秀，　打扮作掩飾，用各種巧妙手腕，機敏拔術，帶着大批烟土漏過檢査網，如此神出鬼沒，莫測高深，使檢査者被騙一時或者感到棘手，讓她們過去。</p>
<p>食夫殉財，古有明訓，年來貴州省當局先後地殺過不少的烟犯，現在遠關閉在牢獄裏的烟犯，全省就不知多少，可是利之所在，衆必趨之，這年頭，生活難過，存僥倖心理的人太多了，不從政治清明，經濟繁榮，分配合理的根本辦法上謀解決，「禁絕年」，將被視爲禁烟宣傳的一種工作進度吧！（劉孟痴）</p>

<p>〔本報福州十五日訊〕福建順昌老虎噬人，爲患甚烈，經省硏究院技士楊洋溢前往殲除，曾誌前訊。茲該楊君已自昌返榕，暢談其打虎經過，極盡恐怖與艱險，宛如一部新編「打虎傳」，茲據實詳述之。近半年來，順昌全縣陷於虎患的恐怖中，不特四鄉吿警，甚至縣城也有隨時被襲可能。鄕人上山伐樹，成爲虎下寃魂者，爲數累累，虎能翻山越嶺，此流彼竄，各鄕皆有虎跡馴至耗噩頻傳，全縣人心惶惶，不可終日，乃出重金向榕徵聘打虎英雄，楊君奮勇應徵，携獵槍一枝，獲狗一頭，獵燈一盞，可謂</p>
<h3>單槍匹狗</h3>
<p>深入虎穴，楊君於六月十九日抵縣，由縣人導往虎患中心區域的元坑鄕，翌晨即行出發尋虎，曾在深山　林中發現老虎吃人的血跡，腥氣薰人，細爲檢視，草間佈存有人體碎骨與殘餘肌腸，闕狀至慘，賴獵狗之嗅覺　機敏，沿山偵察孽獸踪跡，未有結果。此後按日深入於高山峻嶺，於麟峋亂石，荆棘　生中，匍匐前進，其驚險之處，不亞於「泰山得實」之鏡頭。爲了急於除害，常常守候至天明。如是者　五十日，因爲長明的</p>
<h3>餐風飮露</h3>
<p>日　兩淋，夜間時受野蚊的襲擊，睡眠不足，飮食困難，楊君罹患瘧疾，惟仍勉强支持，日夕盼望與虎相見，似乎一己生死皆置度外。迄至八月八日，是一個炎熱的天氣，楊君因發瘧初愈，四肢無力，精神倦怠，正在苦悶發惱之際，忽接元坑鄕附近鄭坊鄉公所的通知，云該鄕大明山上刻有樵夫一入被噬，催即往　，楊君喜出望外，即攜槍率狗，由八個樵夫引導向目的地進發，沿途山勢陡險，林深草茂，樵夫不敢同往，楊君按槍督狗疾步前進，未行百公尺，發現地下有殷紅之血跡，即</p>
<h3>追踪血跡</h3>
<p>行不六十公尺，果在杉樹下發現一肢體雜陳之屍骸，自腿至膝，自頸至頭，皮肉均已　有，衣服被撕粉碎，死者兩目猶露萬分弊駭之光芒，野蠅　　吸吮腥血，在此深林密　黯然無光的背景襯托下，顯得人世間無可描摹的恐怖情景。此時，楊君以虎去必未遠，即令其　狗速回元坑鄕，渠即攀登樹頂，屛息靜候，無何夕陽西沉，仍未見孽獸踪跡，時楊君腹中　　作響，即出其携帶之乾糧充饑，甫　食間，突聞</p>
<h3>高崗虎嘯</h3>
<p>聲。厲而稅，有如馬嘶，山谷震動。楊君急握槍準備放射，不一刻，此爲害人類罪孽昭著之猛虎於樹隙瞞跚而來，只聞砰然一響，彈離槍口，直貫虎胸，再發二槍，虎始僵臥於血泊中，孽命了結。楊君乃朝空發一彈，報訊呼援，奈附近鄉人無懂此獵人信號者，只好疾步下山，呼鄕人六名，前來抬虎，此訊一出，一傳十，十傳百，傳遍全縣，羣情鼓舞。</p>
<h3>死難家屬</h3>
<p>以大仇得報，欣慰不置。翌日，虎屍抬抵縣城，各機關公務員及民衆爭先睹看，該縣上洋導報發佈號外，各機關首長舉杯歡宴，民衆演戲慶祝，其熱烈之情況，爲百年來所僅見。該縣人士爲紀念楊君之豐功偉績，鑄製金牌，籌建紀念碑，並以其事陵宣付縣誌。（特派記者陳正予）</p>

<h3>復旦三千餘師生　瞻拜李登輝遺容　顏惠慶邵力子均云致詞公布揚備極哀榮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕復且大學前校長李登輝博士之遺體，昨日下午二時在膠州路萬國殯儀館，依照基督敎儀式入殮。遺柩定於今日下午三時，安葬於八字橋長老會公墓。昨日儀堂滿佈各界奠送之花圈及挽聯，博士遺體覆以籃底黃字之綢製「復且」校徽，遺容外露。中外各界名流及敎育界人士，邵力子，王憲惠，顏惠慶，黎照寰，錢新之，江一平，奚玉書，端木世，程中行，胡健中，歐元懷，司徒博，徐羽卿，林卓然，及復旦大學，附中，實中師生校友三千餘人，自晨至暮，川流膽拜遺容，備極哀榮。復且現任校長章益，前任校長吳隋軒，文學院長吳　甫，新聞系主任陳望道等，均整日在側招待。下午三時，在謝頌羔等牧師主持下，爲李氏祈禱祝福。旋由顏惠慶博士報吿李氏略歷，顏博士以與李氏「認識早，交情深」之資格，沉痛致詞稱：「余相信不久將有一盛大追悼會舉行，對騰飛先生一生行狀，當另作報吿，今日先略言數點」。李氏生爲華僑，中國備受外國侵凌，李氏目繫心傷，幼年即立志返回祖國，從事敎育，藉以喚醒同胞，發奮圖强，復至美國留學，返國後與曾（國藩）李（鴻章）相談下，決定在國內創辦大學，以期造就廣大之人才。待後李氏與余等加入中華基督敎靑年會。李氏後另創辦中國環球學生會，藉以喚醒靑年人之愛國思想。僅此二端，可見李氏在國內創辦大學之決心。」顏博士譽李氏爲我國數十年來僅有二十餘留學生中道德學問造詣最高者之一人。顏氏復稱：「中國大學校畏中，故北大校長蔡孑民，故聖約翰大學校長上方濟，燕京敎務長司徒雷登，南開校長張伯苓，及故　且校長李登輝，皆係終身從　教育，尤以司徒及卜芳濟兩氏，爲我國敎育，畢生致力，均値得吾人敬佩不忘。」顏博士末稱：「有人以李氏爲余介紹予復且創辦人馬相伯先生爲復且校長者，果爾，余實深慶復且　一「好校長」，且興有榮焉」。次由前晚由京專程來滬之南京復且同學會代表都力子致詞。邵氏以李師之遽然逝世，澯感悲痛。渠引申數語稱：「余之一生，得力於馬相伯，蔡孒民，及李登輝三先生者殊多。相伯先生爲天主敎徒，登輝先生爲基督敎徒，二者同出一源，而民先生則深信美學，三氏共點均以愛國愛民爲職志。敎育家之目的，即在爲國爲民，惟因認識不同，或不能盡合時代之精神及當前之需要。而三氏之領導吾人，則極爲正確。李氏初則主張維新，「九一八」時主張團結　侮，抗戰勝利後，雖在病中對國事仍殷股不忘，此種爲國爲民之熱忱，吾人不論作何職業，均應引爲楷模。詞畢，宣讀各方唁電，末由李氏家屬致謝至下令五時入殮。</p>

<h3>徹底配合國策控制金融四聯分處即將改組　由九個單位合組國行兼主任委員</h3>
<p>滬市未全國金融重心，勝利以後，市場風波迭起。政府當局，雖會設法遏止，但以種種關係，未能如逾期之利息那個。最近四聯總處，爲徹底配合國策，控制上海金融，決將上海分處改組。擴大內部機構，加强職權範圍。該處原係四行兩局一庫及四聯總處各派代表一人爲委員，中國銀行代表兼主任委員，四聯總處代表兼副主任委員。此次改組以後，財政部亦代表參加，共計九個單位，委員九人，主任委員一職，將改由中央銀行代表兼任，副主委仍由四聯總處代表負責。國行總裁張嘉璈氏，則以理事資格負指揮督導之責。內部分三組辦事，第一組黨管業務，第二組掌管貼放，第三組管情檢査。三兩組，大致爲原有業務，改組後當特別加强。第三組係屬新職掌，舉凡存匯款，轉抵押轉押匯重貼現各種貸款，均將切實攷核，配合金融管制。組織及辦法，四聯總電正積極擬定中，最近期內即可實現。</p>
<h3>一片喊買聲音中華股滿堂紅</h3>
<p>華股昨除聯華信誼外，滿堂見紅。永紗信和均有貼價做開，全經會通過减低證金，屈伏多時之冷股，脫穎而出，漲勢且超過熱股。晨開</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>即因報載全經會業已通過減低證金而見俏俐，永紗自三七五元，及三八八元開後，先由三六號等進至三七九元及三九○元，三二號等脫手，二一三號出即交，塲外有廣帮脫手，而迫降至即交三七二元，遞交三八三元低價。一三○號等紛購，內衣首先由一八一號掛漲停，雜股突有大量搜羅者，國貨中紡信和五和永公景綸均掛漲停，美亞現遞均由大衆爭吸而告漲停，而永紗漲到即交三九三元，遞交四○二元·二六號等脫手，一三六號出即交，塲外息價開一角九分半，及二角四，曾回降至二八三元及二九三元·四等再進而升至四○○元外，中興輸船亦掛漲停板。一○五號等脫手，尙多掙扎，終以一五二號等力進之下，買氣仍熾，勤與新光遞景福掛漲停，臨收永紗漲到即交三九三元，遞交四〇八元高價，而後以三九○元及四○四元收市。結果較前收即交股計信誼小升，永紗升半成，華新閘北大通中絲華豐火柴升一成，景福中法新華永公景綸統益榮豐漲一成半，美亞中舫新光國貨五和中泥勤興內衣漲停。遞交股永紗升半成，新光漲二成，華豐升成半，美亞好一成，除均漲停。</p>
<p>後市</p>
<p>乘週末關係，買氣更爲有　無恐，除上場時有一○五號等逢高略出，而退至四○五元及四一○元，五四號等進至即交四一四元漲限，及遞交四二二元。七六號等逢高有出，八九號等賣即交，國行交換差進，而退至四○八元及四一六元。此時全塲一片買風，美亞景福永公信和內衣新光動興中紡中法國貨中泥搪瓷中絲火柴榮豐閘北大通五和統益新亞華新中興新華次第掛紅，圈外黑市又昂，買氣易被掀起。一六九號等爭購，三時後即交永紗首先由一九○號，掛漲停板繼而遞永紗亦吿漲停。臨收時現遞均有貼價二三元成交，結果除信誼聯華外，現遞各股一致漲停，傷外各老股文化股及銀行股再跳一成强，餘均有買少賣。</p>
<h3>統債上漲外股盤升</h3>
<p>公債昨起漲風，五○三室賣出，五○○室等買進，成交增至一千萬。統丙晨開二三一○○元，自二一二○○元盤高至二五五○○元。最後在二四六○○元左右徘徊，較前收計甲乙升二千元，丙漲二千一，丁種亦升一千三，統戊亦好起一千五。</p>
<p>外股昨先時曾因證券帮退還老巢而稍疲，國外黑市又起漲風，港申電縮至四元有零，證券帮錢兌業有出，洋商及廣帮則進。怡紗晨開三一○○○○元，自低價二九八○○○元起，盤升至三四五○○〇元高價結束。結果較前收計各熱股普遍漲起一成至一成半不等，各冷股及橡皮股一片買風。</p>
<h3>黃金走私　澳門爲集散地</h3>
<p>據澳門息，在馬尼拉以公價買得黃金找尋善價而估之黃金商，已使澳門成爲一重要站。前時運來遠東市傷之金，彼等認爲此係最有希望之市塲。平均每週有兩飛機運金來澳門兩次。黃金路錢，係由香港轉來澳門。因本年七月香港政府徇國際貨幣基金之要求，禁止黃金入口。此問商人稱：此等黃金之最後目的地爲中國，由走私者偸運入境云。</p>
<h3>食米上落細</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬九一千七百餘石，市况先漲後跌，猛一進疾退，結果粳秈米均少上落。白陰元亦少出入。麵粉雜牌粉來貨接連，市化平定，無錫回小，隨之挫落三四千元。麩皮跟跌三四千元。</p>
<p>黃豆因油餅俱跌，廠方納胃轉懈，客帮亦然稀少，回跌三萬元，社豆猛挫二三萬元。</p>
<p>菉豆供求兩少，貨主堅挺，提高一二萬元。赤豆成交不多，略升萬元。豇豆平平之格，蠶豆另化尚股，步　萬元。</p>
<p>紅糧北幫停辦，猛跌二萬餘元。苞米北洋續動，依然牢立。芝蔴天津收吸，南洋問津，市形倘俐，挺升一二萬元。生仁廣帮重見猛吸收飛　三五萬元。豆餅　低三五千元。</p>
<p>油市一片賣出聲中，各油均見暴跌不已，生油挫落五六萬元，菜油蔴油淸油相繼挫跌三五萬元，豆油猛落十萬元。</p>
<h3>內銷茶看好</h3>
<p>內銷茶去化旺盛，情勢迄未稍冷，前途一致看好。至於外銷花色，連日供應本亦凋零，而昨市又因開放非洲華茶市塲之孟傳，復吿甚　塵上，故持貨者扳守之意，愈見盛熾，出口商企圖低價進取，更呈泡影，是以交易再度下游。</p>
<h3>游資泛濫銀根鬆弛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕游資泛濫，物復飛　，當局努方抽緊銀根，平抑漲風，惟銀根仍鬆。昨日四行兩局差進四一八億，國行差進七○七億，大交換行莊差出五九四億，洋商銀行進進四一八億，小交換行莊差出二四二億。中行差出五一億，交通差出二八三億，中農差出五○億，中信局差進一五四億，郵匯局差出二一億，合作金庫差出三五億。</p>
<h3>四季限額已核定張總裁返滬公佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據可靠方面消息：輸出入管委員會兼主委張嘉　，出席全經會公畢，將於今明日携經全經會決議之四季限額數字返滬公布，並悉：四季限額爲美金五千三百三十九萬三千元，棉款二千萬美元，並不在內。按上季限額總數爲六千七百八十七萬三千美元，表而上雖較四季爲多，然其中包括二千萬美元棉款，而四季限額與棉款劃開，故實較上季增加五百五十二萬美元。</p>
<p>據本市工業界領袖昨日接見記者，發表對於第四季限額之觀感稱：政府因外匯基金微薄，故一再减少限額之輸入。然以第三季情形而言，原料進口與工業所需要之距離仍遠，今政府又再度减少四季限頗進口，其中距離更爲遙遠，然政府實亦有其不得已之苦衷云。</p>
<h3>工商申請貼放貸款行荘取手續費太多</h3>
<p>據中央銀行秘書處範圍言談稱，該行自實行貼放貸款以來，發覺經手擔保之商舉行莊居中所取之手續費太多。按理各工商業向商業銀行申請抵押貸款，由商業銀行再將該項抵押品轉抵押與國行，國行與百分之七十或八十之貸款，商榮銀行再加百分之二十貧出，工商業貧得百分之百貴族後，即可運用。而今之商業銀行因思大量控制存款，故其本身非但無款貸出，並將向商業銀行轉抵押所貸得之款項，尙規定提出若干存於該行，實際上工商業貸得數字無幾。在通貨膨脹之今日，尙盼各商業銀行多替國家之工商業作想，應盡量將游資導往生產途徑。類如此等情形，實有改良之必要云。</p>
<h3>逃港游資約計竟達二億元之</h3>
<p>關於游資逃港數字，據財政界估計：足達港幣二億元之鉅。此等財主，則以華中及華北一帶富豪居多。存貯本港各銀行之存款，亦達七千萬港幣以上，實際上尙不止此數。因游資逃港方式，甚爲巧妙，故正式統計，至爲困難，在港積聚之逃資，若干係從事於物資搜購，準備於適當時期運入內地，以求利潤。此種投資，所佔數字甚大，約達數千萬元港幣。其他炒買地皮，或設廠製造出品者，亦大有人在，但佔極少數而已。至金融投機，亦爲游資出路之一。二</p>
<h3>議價再行提高面紗瘋狂上漲　廿支紗竄出三千萬大關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕棉紗議價又吿猛升，紡調會議價小組，昨戰決廿支標準紗提高爲三千五百五十萬元，較前激增二百四十萬元。其他谷檔紗價亦均按比例增加，該會除甲組照常配售外，停頓已久之乙組（紗號）亦已恢復配售，昨日售出棉紗總數，爲數極鉅。</p>
<p>又訊：紗布市塲昨行情極度混亂，市價瘋狂上升，市塲內一片漲聲，廿支標準紗已竄出三千萬元大關，超過新議價五百餘萬元之譜。龍頭細布布亦已超出一百三十萬元關，當局對此極端注意。市塲均遍佈經濟警察，嚴密監視，今日更將加緊澈査。</p>
<p>又訊：昨四十二支藍色鳳細紗，最後以四千七百五十萬高價結束，比上日續漲一百萬元。二十支雙馬紗亦升五，七十萬元，其餘各支粗細紗一致榮多辱少。</p>
<p>細布疾升　棉布市况，晨開因隔日紡建統配，號家每戶配得龍頭細布四十疋，市上籌碼頗充，納胃懈怠，交易甚淸，行情一度疲軟。但塲外實力派見價低不乏搜吸，更以紡建紗價提高，布市乃跟踵上揚。結果十二磅龍頭細布比上日狂漲六萬元，每疋爲一百卅二萬元，其餘各檔細市亦再吿躍升五，六萬元，其他各布均見步秀自一萬至四五萬元不一。</p>
<p>現棉續升　昨日現棉市况，趨勢仍堅，人心奇昂，紗廠頻有納胃，散多扒吸，市價再度飛揚，塲上求多供少，價格較上日再漲起三十萬至四十萬不等，成交一八○○包，二五○担。送廠價做開：靈寳五三七萬三千至五五八萬，漢細四七九萬五千至四八三萬六千，沙市四九六萬，德字棉五五四萬，改良美種棉五五四萬，成交九三○包，二五○担。棧交價做開：漢細四六七萬至四八七萬七千，冲沙四九六萬，涇陽新貨五四六萬，火機三二六萬五千，成交八七○包，局浦籽花八○萬</p>
<h3>進出口商反對出口簽證辦法</h3>
<p>輸出入管理委員會非限額分配處，最近計劃舉辦出口簽證辦法，本市進出口商反對頗烈。其理由謂　國產品各種物資運銷出口，價格方面，各商均默不宣揚。因此有關出口之秘密，出口簽證實行後，對此項秘密勢必全部公開無遺。　目前一部份無法出口之物資，可設法隱匿少數外匯，售諸黑市，藉以彌補虧蝕。故現尙有零星之物資可以出口，若實行出口簽證後，外匯自無法隱匿。售預計出口，亦因此可能减少百分之四十。出口停頓之情形將更烈。　實行出口簽證，即變相之初步實施管制出口，在鼓勵出口聲中，對出口再加管制，非但不能收獲良好結果，反之，足以刺激國人疲於出口。縱觀目前之形勢，出口簽證，必需暫緩實施云。</p>

<h3>配煤張家不確</h3>
<p>據悉：京滬廠商爲使冬季用煤無慮，前前前曾加緊自非管制區採購自運。棗莊方面之烟煤二萬多噸，已由津莊鐵路運來京滬。現路局方面正加派車輛協助，前傳配煤將行漲價，現因來源甚多，燃管會決定維持原　。以期人心　定云。</p>

<h3>中信收購秋絲全部充作外銷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局本年度收購秋將，目前已收達六千五百餘担，距原計劃一萬四千六百担仍遠。該項已收購秋絲將全部充作外銷，其中三千担已運銷印度緬甸等地，餘數亦陸續運銷中。</p>
<h3>呢絨上游</h3>
<p>呢絨標準行情，邇因天冷銷路活潑，大多數復趨上游。麥而登大衣呢制服呢，長毛駝斯錦馬褲呢，花呢宣維華達，中厚　嘰平厚呢等。莫不暢銷，明暗見秀。裏　類如法西　，黑炭　，絲光羽紗，袖　綢，紗背　花洋布等，成交亦暢，零批估價，均因原料及整理費用資關係，悉見昂挺。絲光羽紗最見旺銷，頭號每碼喊　七萬五千元，二號六萬七八千元，三號六萬元，紗　　八萬五千元至十萬元，袖　　售七萬五千千元至九萬元，花洋布五萬元左右。法西襯二萬五千元至三萬元、黑炭襯四萬起至六萬元止。</p>
<h3>人造絲疲途徘徊　市價比上日軋小一百萬元</h3>
<p>人造絲所日中信局配售絲織榮已在申請中，故雖有其他物價飛翔刺激，仍不脫疲軟形象。一二○○號一A旭字有光，上午一度降至九千九百萬元，後又升至一億○三三百萬元之間，午後再挫至一百萬元有成交。最後復稍回好，喊二百萬元賣出，終比上日軋小一百萬元。</p>
<p>廠絲</p>
<p>昨市行情平穩，因市價提高後，各方均存觀望，交易極稀。五相有單子貨喊價俱無一更動，高另担略有做開，價仍爲七百萬至八百萬元。千經昨市見昂，特上另祖已達六千萬元左右，普通另祖，亦喊至五千五百萬元。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市除被面及格瑩縐均係踢皮球交易而飛揚外，其他各貨，因實銷甚淡，所漲無幾。大誠與華强眞絲被面開市八百九十萬元有成交，買多於賣，步步高翔，中問不乏乘高拋售，一度小回。終因股市開盤見好，迄收市高至九百廿五萬元即期價，下午又因紗布等均吿挺升，人心振奮。最後做價，竟漲至三千○廿五萬元，比上上日漲百七十萬元。大誠格子　縐，十一萬五千元，比上日大五千元。捲菸稅又將調整</p>

<h3>藝壇的沉悶</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>戰後藝術空氣的沉悶，文壇的衰頹，寥落，多數人因爲事不關已，不肯多加思索，好像也祇能提出一個懶惰的理由，設是物價高漲，生活艱困，有以使然。這在從事文藝工作的人們，總以爲不是那麼簡單，他們彷彿都有滿腹的苦悶，急待發洩；而又苦於發洩不出來。</p>
<p>我們倘不願讓這種沉悶的局面，永遠拖延下去；就是說，我們必須撥開籠罩在藝術家們心頭的愁　，使能恢復戰時興奮熱烈的情緒，努力爲建設富强康樂的新中國，甚至是重建新世界而寫作，就應該平心靜氣，先來澈底檢討一番藝壇沉悶的原因。</p>
<p>變殘敗不堪的世界，好似似一隻渡過大風暴的破船，滿船待救的生命，此時還拋在驚風駭浪裏，眼巴巴地坐視另一個大風暴在沉悶的低氣壓下將醖釀成熟，設不幸而爆發，就祗有同備於盡。絕望的陰影，淹沒了希望的太陽，少數人的愚魯，自私，野　……正加緊爲人類復製可悲的浩刦，要他們回復到淸醒的理知，又要白白地浪費成千成萬的生命和不可計數的生活資源了。這在藝術家們的想像中，實已預知，且能運用熟練的技巧，亳不誇張的描繪出這一幅凄慘的圖畫多但大家並沒有這樣做。第二次的世界大殘殺，雖然縮减了全人口的總比率，但人類的野心是不會死減的；當此刻又有人企圖發展自己的野心時，而可憐的人類，惑於野心家們所發出的新穎又動人的口號，好像願意視死如歸一般，這是人性的大悲刦—是人類情願發揮弱點所鑄成的浩刦！極少數的藝術家們祗有自愧渺小，自慚無能，自知乏力的低沉的聲音，喊不醒人類的迷夢，而更加沉默了！</p>
<p>平心而論，藝術家們際此全人類的休戚將決於俄頃的關頭，是決不應該保特沉默的！我們不要以爲積極展開今天的文藝工作，無救於人類的厄運，先自灰心喪志，放下自己的武器，陷於悲悶的沉淵在二次大戰中爭取勝利的最重要的因素，是科學家發明的原子彈，而爭取勝利的和平，和平的建設，應該是敎育家思想家科學家共同的努力，尤其是藝術家們把握着全人類「求生存，愛和平」的主題，盡量呼　，努力寫出的偉大的作品。我們倘能冷眼靜觀，時時拆穿野心家們的圈套，揭開他們散佈的烟幕，他們爲要能够站得住，立得穩，可以在某種名義下擒取「蚩蚩者氓」的盲從，祇有時刻變換好聽的口號；而總是徒勞無益，極難如願。這在有形無形中便能延遲大風　的到來，至少可以在大風暴侵　的頃刻，有力地抵擋一陣，讓他們尙有反省的空隙。他們在權衡輕重，熟審利害之後，也許能縮小自已的　　，立刻適可而止，懸崖勒馬吧？因爲那些野心家的一念之轉——適轉與順轉，是決定人類休戚的寒暑表，而決定寒暑表昇降的溫度，到今天爲止，廣大的人民似乎還沒有多大的力量，老實說，藝術家們的工作，總是一個重要的因素。這樣說，當和平的航船拋了錨，擱淺在半途的今天，我們的藝術工作者怎麽可以不自振拔，長此沉默呢！現實的一切，是水不能使渴求這步的藝術家們感到滿足的；但亦無須悲觀，不必失望，適足反證我們的工作，需要加緊努力，倒是千　萬確的事實。基於此義，我們與共不滿現實，還不如先對自己不滿，再作客觀的自我檢討，找到正確的方向，勇往邁進。那就是毅然記然接受全人類「求生存，愛和平」的要求，勞力推進自己的工作，努力推進和平的航程，努力推送滿船待救的生命，渡到和平幸福的彼岸！</p>
<h3>讀詩偶記</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>讀書人作詩，每多沿　，不知書者，反多出已意。劉邦大風歌，項羽垓下歌，斛律金敕勤歌，皆能發自然之妙。漢武帝秋風歌，韓愈琴操，詞雖較工，然皆涉於　擬，未若三者之出自性情矣。</p>
<p>王績詩：「眼看人盡醉，何忍獨爲醒！」此出楚辭，屈原日：「衆人皆醉我獨醒。」阮卓詩：「相忘自有樂，莊惠豈能知？」此出南華經，「惠子日：爾非魚，安知魚之樂耶？曰：爾非我，安各大我不知魚之樂耶？」王阮兩詩，善於翻案。子美曰：「明年此會知誰健，醉把茱　仔細看。」劉浚詩：「不用茱萸仔細看，管取明年各强健。」古詩云：「胡馬依北風，越鳥巢南枝。」范雲詩：「越島憎北樹，胡馬畏風。」此雖翻案，殊見拙而無味。</p>
<p>律對千支，貴在虛用。如溫庭筠詩：「風捲蓬根屯戊己，月移松影守庚申；」謝榛詩：「半嶺餐霞延甲子，孤燈照夜守庚申，「均極工穩。若許渾詩：「年長每勞推甲十，夜寒初共守庚申，」則實對千支，殊欠渾厚矣。按守庚申典出自西陽　俎。愛日齋　鈔載：徐貿詩：「豐年甲子春無雨，良夜庚由夏足眠；」劍南詩：「處處喜晴春甲子，家家築室越庚申；」積雨恐防春甲子，燈昏慚守夜庚申。」苕溪漁隱云：「雨天逢甲子，夜坐守庚申。」均以千支入對者。</p>
<p>詩中不避「龜」字。蘇較和桃花源詩：「重龜亦最吸，杞狗亦夜吠；」包　秋日園林詩：「鳥　新罅栗，龜上半欹建，」均躋上乘。而東坡又喜拈用爲韻，如「綠荷深處有遊龜」，「縮頸夜眠如凍龜」，「欲將齒髮鬥蛇龜」，「　父盡携龜」等是。庾信詠荷詩：「若有千年蔡，須巢但見隨，」梁簡文納凉詩：「遊魚吹水沫，神　上荷心；」元鎭芳樹詩：「淸池養神龜。」蔡雖大龜，然以蔡字入詩，反不若龜字之明爽也。</p>
<p>「人烟隔水靜，鬼火照沙塞，」此四溟山人憶雁門詩句也。詩中火言寒者罕見。庾信詩：「絡　無機織，流　帶火寒；」吳激詩：「浩渺渚田熟，靑螢漁火寒」下句均奇，惜所對不解四溟山人聯，似較　吳爲工矣。</p>
<h3>霜楓</h3>
<p>— 季珂</p>
<p>你脫下了綠色的外套的孩子，你紅了雙雙頰睡在秋天的林野裏的美麗的姑娘，你眞使我醉心了，我怎樣才能告訴你我的心情呢！</p>
<p>你可還記得你的母親，她給你在耳邊掛滿了珠寳，白色的半圓形的殊寳，在溫暖的季節裏，她給你籌備了這一批嫁妝。道還記得，那時，我常坐在你的身傍，談一册可愛的詩章；你綠色的外套給我遮蔽炎陽的强光，常我抬頭偸看你的美麗時，你却也望我一下使我害羞。偶而在假日，你也肯講遠古的神話給我聽，我便想永遠不離開你，聽你的聲音。</p>
<p>但是，在寒月寗靜地凝視着你的一個夜晚，我聽不到那些出色的音樂家爲你歡愉的歌聲。夜鷹在哀嗚，他吿訴我，你害着急病，然而，沒有一隻醫生的手，可以知悉你的病症。你的呻吟再也不能使我度過這夜的溪流了。寒風調弄你，狡猾的笑聲，使我嫉妒的心再也不能忍受了。我要披一身月光來看你，用我鋼勁的臂膀阻擋他們的去路。可我的胸中已滿悲哀而凄凉了。</p>
<p>你像一個將死的處女，命定的溫柔的忍受，沒有一句怨言，不發怒，慘淡的嘴唇上有着微笑。你不見到深深的堵墓嗎嗎，你的姿態上的紫紅的光輝閃　　，今天你在這裏活着，明天卻不再生存了。甜蜜的可悲的日子；夢着的眼睛的　媚；說着永遠的你的美麗與我可親。我愛你，然而，你生命的奢侈的傾頹，卻使我悲哀。</p>
<p>當東方招呼我火紅的光亮的一個淸長我懐着滿腔的悲哀來拾你的殘紅。西風將你從地上抱起，却又無力地將你放下。你眞像載有太多的憂傷。我從他們的懐裏搶下了你，挾在我愛　的詩章</p>
<h3>失眠音樂會</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>波波波！都都都！波！……</p>
<p>新出世的八氣缸別克眞好頑皮，老是亂叫亂嚷，深夜中一路上，還是波波波地時過來，都都都地嚷過去。奉命禁止它呌鬧的夜勤的巡捕，也只好：「哼！」冷笑一聲，聊以解嘲，送它遠去。……波波波！都！……</p>
<p>肺病患者的乾咳嗽，肆無忌憚，不顧一切，橫暴地從窒悶的胸膛中，從乾燥的嘴吧裏衝出來，橫掃過燈光慘淡，寂無人的街心，跳到你的窗前，重重地叩打着玻璃。</p>
<p>初冬未曉的純空中，淸脆的好喉嚨，一聲聲：</p>
<p>「白糖年糕！……重糖年糕！……」</p>
<p>一串水晶球似的，從這邊街頭潑到那邊街梢。</p>
<p>用着這樣嘹亮的男高音包裝起來的年糕，已够叫人埀涎三尺了，何况又是重糖的，白糖的，甜蜜蜜的！</p>
<h3>語林</h3>
<p>— 愷公</p>
<p>「語林」晉產和中河東處士斐啓撰，　　漢魏以來士林言語對答之可稱者。詎以記謝安語不實，爲安所詆，書遂隆。「世說新語」詆篇曾略及此事。其文字體例亦略與世說相似。「太平御覽」三八九錄其遺文一則云「王子猷嘗暫寄人空宅住，使令種竹。或問暫住何煩爾？　咏良久，直指竹日：「何可一日無此君」」後人所謂「不可居無竹」者，　出此。裏。　有我的詩，才會懂得你，使你的哀怨化爲新生的力量。農人們在你的病體上蒐集你的遺產，白色的果實，隨着一陣陣歡笑和鈎刀的聲音落下。他們歡愉，他們感謝你的恩惠；他們感謝你爲了他們犧牲。然而，他們從沒有爲你的美麗歌誦呀！祗有我，這癡情的孩子，還憧憬着你的光華。</p>
<h3>春光堂近詩</h3>
<p>— 陳樹人</p>
<p>林森公園小遊同大塊</p>
<p>市園偏覺愛秋光，霜葉渲紅菊綻黃；不是畫家容大塊，更誰同我「評章。</p>
<p>偕若文散步市園偶感</p>
<p>壯遊峻嶽登新陸（廿年前曾共登落山磯），赴難空郊寄古渝；偕隱只今藏鬧市，吾儕樂土徧寰區。</p>
<p>通衢晚步</p>
<p>向晚姑舒散第身，回車千百颶街塵；不知疾駛飛馳客，可似徐行安步人？</p>
<p>喜食螃蟹</p>
<p>江南秋到又持螯，酒綠花黃興更高；詩畫卅年行脚健，今朝酬得十分勞！</p>
<p>園坐漫興</p>
<p>着處都令起遠思，人生可有小林時？夕陽沒後秋光歛，疏柳殘槐尙弄姿。</p>
<p>重遊虹口公園偕若文</p>
<p>池亭橋榭未全荒，也得重來坐夕陽；却喜白頭人尙健，淸茶幾盞話滄桑。</p>
<p>重九雅集冠生園</p>
<p>市中縱有三層閣，眼底都無盈尺丘；似此登高堪發噱，惟茲勝會屬名流；　　撲地非塵俗，詩書逢塲即雅幽。得向艱時謀一醉，巳將佳節盡情酬。</p>
<p>秋深</p>
<p>市居何事閉重門，小院秋深靜不喧；勿謂新來無意緒，夕陽黃葉好消魂。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「您意見怎麽樣？」聽了小老虎的報吿之後，我想探聽　羣的意見。</p>
<p>「要車，確得我去說一聲。」　羣這時　起了眉尖，低頭沉吟，好做挑動了滿腹的心事似的。</p>
<p>「不是要車的意思，」我補充着：「幾部汽車，我還可以辦得來……我是問您，咱們這裏應該怎麼佈置；誰去誰不去？被矮子們圈禁了的人怎麽辦？　然不能扔下他們。……還有買沙夫一方面，咱們也得有一番應付不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「這一切都好辦，我　　話，也可以暫且擱下；買沙夫這塊料，也可以不煩心思……只是我在想……」　羣說到這裘，忽然頓住了。面容上竟漸次褪了顏色，好像精神上或身體上，忽然感覺到很大的一陣痛楚似的。</p>
<p>「您想怎麽樣？」我聽她話裏有話，不禁惶恐起來，有些捉不準耀羣的心思。</p>
<p>「起了幾位同志，都交給我好了，我還有點辦法。」剛醒過來的鼎元，這時忽然插口說話了。</p>
<p>「那當然好，可是我希望您也跟我們一路上北平去才好。」我應着界元說着；可是這時，我的全副心事，都築中在　　那種模校的態度上，於是重又問着　羣；「您當然得上天津去一趙，因鶴見忽然這麼大規模地動員，必是事情十二分重大。您……」</p>
<p>「我嗎？」耀羣只進出了這兩個字，忽地掉下了一串大眼淚珠來。我正不知道要說什麽才好，只見錐羣用手掩住了臉面，倐地起身，往後屋子裏面去了。</p>
<p>傍晚，約定的時刻一到，我們大家都　備上車的當口，人人都齊，却只看不見耀羣和小老虎二人的影子。躭着無限麻煩和危險，我們呆候了一刻鐘模樣，耀羣和小老虎仍就未見踪跡。我心下雖也有些明白，他們兩人，何以無端不知去向，但也無法挽救，只好發令動身。（第九章完）</p>

<h3>酸齊妙曲</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>余日前曾以每句有一「春」字之雙卿妙詞，介紹於讀者，茲復想起酸齊亦有每句用「春」字之曲，曲雖甚短，風趣特佳，爲再錄之於次：</p>
<p>酸齊嘗赴所親宴，座客有以「淸江引」請賦，且限「金木水火土「五字冠於每句之首，時正立春，又須各用「春」字，酸齊即席　云：「金銀影搖春燕斜，木　生春葉，水塘春始波，火候春初熟，土牛兒載將春去也。」座客皆爲絕倒。</p>
<p>按酸齊畏吾人，爲可　海涯之孫，父名震只　，遂以實爲氏，自名小　石海　，　　　，又號　花道人。明寗獸王權太和正者　評其詞如天馬脫　，則其詞之美可知也。酸齋生而神彩秀異，齊力絕人，年七二三時，即好勇　門，當使健兒　三惡馬疾馳，已持　而立待，馬至，騰身上之，越一而騎三，運　生風，觀者辟易。及長，折節讀盡，仁宗朝，拜翰林學士，忽　然嘆曰：一辭　居卑，普賢所尙，」乃稱疾辭居江南，　　錢塘市中，　姓名，易冠服，人無　者。觀此，酸痛非特允文允武，亦紅腹　外人也。</p>
<h3>競選解頣錄</h3>
<p>— 魏風江</p>
<p>競選須有技巧，最要緊的當然是吹。或口吹，或筆吹，或自吹，或人吹。我國人尙穩健，故競選時以筆吹或人吹爲主，歐美人喜冒險，故哉選者以自吹並口吹者爲多。</p>
<p>冒險者成功易而失敗亦易，因爲當你口若縣河，興高采烈的時侯，潛伏着的反對者也許會突然給你一個　刺，你如不能從容應變，予打擊者以打擊，那你的聽衆就會在你神色慌張的當兒一哄而散，從此你再也不能號召，也永無獲選的希望了。</p>
<p>某次一位老者在競選國會議員的時候，率直而感慨地開始他的演辭：「主席先生，我是活得够了……」一語未畢，即有一人在座上直呌道：「聽罷，他活得够了　」全塲哄然大笑，老者默獸地坐下去，氣得　　也發抖了。</p>
<p>另有一個競選者用　　而沉重的語氣數說着他的許多改革主張：</p>
<p>「我們需要土地里芳Iandreform我們需要居住里芳House　reform我們需要保險里芳Insurance　reform我們需要…………」「羅芳Chloroform」一個聽衆接下去這樣說着。這麻醉藥一字眞的把道位演說者迷住，他呆若木雞了。</p>
<p>機警的競選者決不會被人輕易地擊下去。一位因嗜酒而面色變成緋紅的競選者，正當結束一篇有力的演說時，突有一個聽衆高聲問道：「喂，波納爾，我問你，你的面色何以會變得這樣紅？，」波納爾毫不慌張地回答道：「鄹是因爲看到你的臉皮太厚，听以我　顏了。」</p>
<p>「聽不到，聽不到。」一個總衆老是這樣嚷着。台上的競選者於是裝出詫異的樣子，說道：</p>
<p>「難道像你這樣長的耳朶，還會聽不到我的話嗎？」於是全塲的頭都轉過去看那呌嚷者的耳朶，他不再呌嚷了。</p>
<p>一個參加市長競選的候選人，在演說的時候，對當前市政略予攻擊。一個反對者向他呌道：</p>
<p>「你說這裏有許多失業者，這話是不可靠的。我的姊姊想在此找一兩個鋸木頭的人，始終找不到」。演說者迅速地回答道：「我不相信你的話是眞的，除非我親自會見了令姊。」</p>
<p>從前英國自由黨領袖勞合喬治是一位雄辯家。有一次一個婦女打斷了他的演說：</p>
<p>「喬治，假使我是你的老婆，我一定要毒死你」。勞合喬治回答道：「夫人，假使你是我的太太，我一定甘願吞　食你的毒藥。」</p>
<p>叉有一次，他與一個阻擾他說話的人開了一次大玩笑。那個人高聲問道：「喬治先生，你還記得你的祖父是一個　車夫嗎？」勞合喬治沉思了一會兒說道：「各位先生，請原諒我。車子　已經忘記了，可是我發現那　子居然還活着。」言時以目光注視那個發問的人。對於這樣的人你有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>在一個婦女大會中，一位女士在她的演辭達到最重要的關頭時，問她的聽衆：「什麽才是我們解放的結果呢？」她發間後環視四周，靜候答覆。這可激怒了位站在塲角的男子，他是來會塲上等他妻子回家去的，他高聲回答道：「我知道」。講台上的女士輕蔑地說道：「你們聽，那個禿項的矮子說他能回答我們的問題。請他說說看。」</p>
<p>「冷了的飯菜和衣服破碎的孩子」是那個矮子的回答。</p>
<p>邱吉爾的夫人，有一次爲她丈夫遊說。她遇見一個工人，請他帮忙。「不」，那工人回答道：「我不打算投一個要睡到中飯邊才起身的人的票。」邱吉爾夫人道：「決沒有這樣的事，我是他的夫人，你應當相信我。」那工人道：「夫人，你是那樣的美麗，使我更信我的話是實在了」</p>
<p>十九世紀英國有一個政治家麥考來，他在愛丁堡有過這樣一件事。一天晚上，他與他的競選者同站在一個台上。突然有一個聽衆把一隻死貓丢在他身上。那人馬上起來道　，說是錯丢在他身上的。麥考來說道：「好，我希望你打算丟我而錯丢在別人身上。</p>
<h3>戰時新郎</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>許多美國的戰時新娘，紛紛地隨他們的夫婿返國了。其中有一個和其他的新娘性別不同，他是一個男子，他和一個美軍女護土結了婚，就隨了他妻子入了美國籍。他是一個與衆不同的戰時新娘——戰時新郞。</p>
<p>洛卡德是一各比利時派往德國的聯絡官，偶然被汽車撞傷了，臥在美軍醫院中，因此認識了軍中女護士凱塞林。他病愈之後，被比軍解職了，於是在紐綸堡美國軍部中充當一名文職人員，那時他們倆訂了婚。</p>
<p>結婚必須要得到美軍總部的批准，那不像女兒向父母請求一般的簡易。洛卡德　就了五份的履歷，向美軍總部申請結婚。兩個月後，批文下來了，他們兩人的結合，並無違反美軍的規定，可以准許結婚。洛卡德想早些取得美國國　，所以再到領事館去詢問。過了四個月才得到回音，說是照美國法律二七一條的規定，可以作爲戰時新娘，獲得美國的國籍。</p>
<p>洛卡德拿了領事館的信，到美軍總部去辦理必需的手續。困難的問題發生了，軍事條例中沒有男性的戰事新娘的。結果以凱塞林配偶的名義，將申請書送進去。六個星期後，美軍總部承認洛卡德是一佩職時新娘，並附來一份表格，調查他的過去情形，現在有沒有懐孕？幾個月了？這事使那個畢性的戰時新娘，弄得啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>後來洛卡德又接到通知，呌他到戰時新娘組去登記。那裏是軍人眷屬的宿舍，全都是女人和孩子，祗有他一個是男人，但他目前的地位，祗可遷居進去。管理員指定他住在第十一號，到了那裏，却不能進去，管理第十一號的軍　說：那裏旣沒有房閒，又沒有床位，因爲那裏祗有軍人可住。他雖是一個准軍人，可是他現在不過是一個軍人的配偶。又到了第十號，可是那裏都是女人。</p>
<p>這個特　的新娘，把管理人員難住了，勉强在第九號一個尉官的床上睡一晚。第二天，把那尉官的床讓了出來給他。他們兩在餐　裏吃飯，凱塞林照値付款，洛卡德却不必付錢，因爲他是戰時新娘，是政府的新客，可以憑戰時新娘　進餐的。</p>
<p>洛卡德盼望了好久，終於和許多戰時新娘一同返國了。當他上船的時候，又受到阻攔，因爲他旣非軍人，又不是軍人的眷屬。但主管人員是知道的，仍把他送上了船。那時甲板上，走　　，却被海陸軍人佔據了。照例他可以到頭等艙裏去，因爲那裏是戰時新娘的艙位，可是他是一個男的戰時新娘呀。於上讓出了一間船員的房間，充　男性的戰時新娘的艙位</p>
<p>這個唯一的戰時新郞，　在戰時新娘羣中，抵達了他的新祖國。因爲他性別的差異，遭了許多麻煩，　了無　美話。　等到了美國以後，他所收到的通知函件，信封上總是寫着「洛卡德夫人」，哪裏知道他不是新娘，而是一個道地的新郎呢。</p>
<h3>選舉意中人</h3>
<p>— 孑予</p>
<p>台北游彌堅市長說：「選舉國大代表，一如選擇郞君，必須選出意中人」。</p>
<p>郞才女貌，天成佳耦。選郞無才，終身遺憾。但才有內外的分別，「面子」上「一表人才」，私底下說不定是「　花枕頭」；「滿肚皮」「鈴　經綸」，臉兒上或者會「黑漆一國」。選擇意中人倘只「以貌取人」，那就「失之子羽」！</p>
<p>再說現下一般「好逑君子」，頗有手腕。當他未獲眞個消魂」以前，往往言甘如蜜，情深如海。大有「要他東，不敢朝一些兒西」的湊趣。但你切勿眞的以爲可「仰望終身」，須知道有人在騙你上手。</p>
<p>如果選舉國代，眞如女子選取意中人的話，那末請勿「河漢吾言」。</p>
<p>美國小姐</p>
<h3>美國小姐的宗教觀</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>宗敎國家的人民，不一定就完全信仰宗敎，反之，大多數的人利用宗敎儀式作爲社交手段。美國習慣每星期日上午九時至十時做禮拜，居民拖男帶女換了簇新的衣服，打扮得齊齊整整，平時赤脚的鄉下佬也穿起壽頭壽腦的西裝，打起領結，假充斯文地去做禮拜，在敎堂中可以晤見許多難得見面的親戚朋友和鄉鄰，從噓寒問暖的應　話，一直可以談到交易買賣的生意經，靑年男女，尤其把做禮拜視作結交異性朋友的好機會，表面上是規規矩矩，暗地裏是男愛女貪，平時不大碰頭的小情人，趁禮拜之便，約一是時間，在星期日下午，可以一淘玩個痛快。美國女子除少數捨身從事傅敎者外，多數對於宗敎並無深切認識，她們根本弄不淸舊敎新敎中的分門別類，系統百出，你問她爲什麼要進這一個敎堂而不去另一個敎堂，她也說不出所以然來。還有許多人是跟了人家走路，人家到什麼敎堂，她也到什麽教堂，有些女子因爲有嘹亮的歌喉，初人請去唱讚美詩，她根本把唱讚美詩看做出風頭的好機會，少不得每星期表演一番。</p>
<p>在教堂中有許多向不相識的靑年男女，因爲坐在一起或跑在一起，便互相鍾情起來，有情人終成眷屬，耶穌自有道理。</p>
<p>丹佛有一位華僑軍官便是在敎化中認識了當地一位獨生金髮女郞，不到三個月，就舉行婚禮，小夫婦倆常常伴同新娘的父母到軍官俱樂部吃飯，因此我和他們也都認識，這位華僑軍官連汽車沒有一部，而那位金髮女郞可算得是一位天仙化人，在美國女性中少有的美麗。</p>
<p>丹佛大學硏究院的Public　Speaking別　出一個「中美通婚」的題目，諸位　　博士辯得面紅耳赤，我竭力贊成通婚，美國的男人反對通婚，美國女人年輕的贊成通婚，年老的反對通婚，老實說，年老的美國女人根本就沒有人要，任她去反對吧！（十）（四）</p>

<h3>饑饉的德國</h3>
<p>— 石譯</p>
<p>一個只有十四歲的靑年，使僅是爲了他父親偸吃家里的隔宿之糧，他便欲圖害他自己的父親，這種逆倫的事情，無非是受痛苦，飢餓，儈惡所指示而發生的，相同的事情，在德國正在流行着。</p>
<p>還有一個例子，有一個少婦，她失戀後寫了一封信給報紙的記者，她想請記者吿訴她關於離婚的手續，至於其失戀的理由，那是只因爲她的丈夫在某天的半夜里偷偷摸摸地起身，把第二天的配給糧食吃完了。</p>
<p>於是那報紙的記者便寫信給這少婦說：</p>
<p>「請你忘掉離婚這二個字，下次妳只要食樹里加上一口鎖，那就萬無一失了。這是個通病，有幾千幾百位婦女，她們都爲了這種類似的事情感到苦惱。同時，這也並不是我們男子所情願做的事，實在是沒有辦法想呀！不過，這也是妳的責任，妳爲什麼不預先提防，不把食物平均分配給家人吃呢？」</p>
<p>這位十四歲的靑年，現在是求學於基督敎主辦的商業學校。一般熱心於福利事業者都如此想，如果將他留在家里同他父親再一起居住是很危險的事，因爲他是這樣地痛憎着他的父親。有一天，（事情發生的一天），他孩子氣地對囘學說：「我偸了一片麵包，以那片麵包換來了這包毒藥，以道包毒藥，我將要去害死我的父親。」他的同學把此事吿訴了他們的敎師，教師因爲不忍這天眞的孩子受法律制裁，乃呌校工去請了幾位福利工作者來。據這幾位福利工作者的調查結果，其主因不過是他父親將他應有的配給食糧吃掉了。</p>
<h3>瓶隱</h3>

<h3>談少年警察</h3>
<p>— 堇</p>
<p>今天報上登載了一節消息，說是少年警察到飯店裏去檢查酒菜的時候，因了客人的笑談而「成儀盡失」，執行任務極感困難。</p>
<p>我們知道，少年警察原是流落在街頭的一羣；我們也知道，少年警察的執行職務，應該和普通警察一樣上不應受人輕視，更不應被人因「身世」而取笑。但是，就已發生的事情來看，我們眞不敢想像那些吃客是以怎樣的態度來對待少年警察。</p>
<p>試想：一羣日常以蘿　乾作菜（引某報語）的少年警察，走進那些繁華的宴會處去工作，還要受那吃客的渺視的笑　，該使他們有怎樣的感覺！</p>
<p>本來，四百萬一席的酒宴在某一部人心中根本不以爲意；「我有錢，你管我的！」少年警察的檢查，他們正嗤嗤以鼻，覺得眞是一種「新奇」的玩意，何必加以理睬？</p>
<p>爲了使某些人不能太高興，爲了使節約令能　利　行，願少年警察們不怕笑　，爲公衆服務；更　當局能予少年警察以適當的權力，來處理那些　法的事件。我們認爲少年警察應有最低限度的「威嚴」＿即：人格的　嚴。　（上）「處處聞啼鳥」中之歐陽莎菲與張琬　（下）「釵頭觀」中陳蕙芝與逆子平</p>

<h3>National Universal Suffrage Constitution Founding Hundreds of Millions of People Seriously Vote, Madame Chiang Votes for People's Socialist Party Figure</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The National Assembly election commenced simultaneously across the country on the 21st. Apart from those still in areas disturbed by communist rebellion, hundreds of millions of compatriots are experiencing their first lesson in practical democratic education amidst excitement and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Voting for the general election began on the 21st. From early morning, national flags were flying everywhere in the capital. The polling stations were more lively than usual. Today is the voting day for women's organizations. Women's groups in the capital are fully mobilized, lining up at various polling stations, waiting to cast their votes. The Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, along with the Police Chief Han Wenhuan and election officials, are making separate rounds to inspect the polling stations. Foreign reporters are particularly interested, going in groups to observe. Madame Chiang arrived at the Yunhuaqiao Elementary School polling station on Zhujiang Road at 11:09 a.m. Before writing her ballot, she carefully consulted the list of candidates. In the end, she voted for Ms. Wang Yongde and left after personally placing the ballot in the box. Chinese and foreign reporters took many photos. It is noted that Wang Yongde is a member of the People's Socialist Party and a candidate from women's organizations. Those present were very impressed by Madame Chiang's spirit of transcending party affiliations. Also, the capital is now filled with the fervor of the election, with slogans and leaflets in novel and colorful designs. The 22nd is the voting day for professional organizations, and the 23rd is for regional elections.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The National Assembly elections in Beiping are being held in separate districts. At 8 a.m., a whistle sounded from Jingshan, and radio stations and broadcasting vehicles were also deployed. This morning, the weather was cold and gloomy, and citizens' voting was not very enthusiastic. At 9 a.m., He Siyuan and his wife went to the Xishiku polling station with their citizen identification cards from the 14th Bao. The most enthusiastic voting in the city was at the special polling station for the Railway Workers' Union at Xiagongfu, where more than 500 people had voted by noon. Among the regional polling stations, the Youth Center's first polling station was the best arranged, with dozens of people voting there by noon. At the Fifth District Gospel Church's first polling station, 59 people had voted by noon. The candidates, Xu Huidong, Bu Qingmao, and Xu Du, used cars to pick up and drop off voters.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The list of Legislative Yuan candidates nominated by political parties has not yet been submitted to the Election Headquarters. The Election Headquarters sent letters to the three parties on the 21st urging them to nominate candidates. It is reported that as of the evening of the 21st, the lists of the People's Socialist Party and the Youth Party were still under negotiation. The current deadlock lies in the People's Socialist Party's insistence on an equal number of nominations as the Youth Party, while the Youth Party is demanding 20 more nominations than the People's Socialist Party, hence the delay in the final decision.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Youth Party had previously submitted a list of candidates for the Supervising Committee nominated by political parties, and the People's Socialist Party had also agreed on a list in Shanghai, but it had not yet been submitted. It was learned on the 20th that the lists of both parties were still under consideration. It is reported that the Youth Party's submitted list was returned on the evening of the 21st.</p>

<h3>Zeng Qi Discusses His Impressions of Universal Suffrage: Madame Chiang Demonstrates True Democratic Spirit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The 21st was the first day of national universal suffrage voting. Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Youth Party, concerned about the election administration, personally went to various voting districts at 10 a.m. to observe the voting situation of the voters. He distributed the ten reasons for implementing constitutionalism, which he had written, to the election workers. Zeng said of his impressions of voting: It is rare to have this situation in the initial trial of universal suffrage. He believes that the enthusiasm will be even greater in the second universal suffrage six years later. Because today is the voting day for women's organizations, Zeng said that women are voting so enthusiastically, and the future of Chinese women's participation in politics is very promising. When Zeng was at the Wangjiang Road Elementary School polling station, he learned that Madame Chiang voted for Ms. Wang Yongde of the People's Socialist Party, and believed that Madame Chiang's non-partisan approach was a true democratic spirit.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Military Subcommittee Urges Prompt Assistance to China and Advocates Early Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 21st Broadcast: Washington News, the U.S. House Military Subcommittee submitted a report today advocating an early peace treaty with Japan and hoping to retain three naval bases in Japan. The subcommittee was led by Republican Congressman Cole on a tour of the world. The report put forward the following points: Provide more and faster assistance to the Chinese government. Send a U.S. military delegation to train Greek troops. Develop Truk Island as a large naval base in the Pacific. Strengthen military facilities on Guam. Retain the Ryukyu Islands as a U.S. strategic base. Increase oil storage in Pearl Harbor so that it can be used for one year in the event of war. The report strongly urges a peace treaty with Japan, and the U.S. military can withdraw from Japan after the treaty is signed. Although the report does not directly name the Soviet Union, it says that if any country expresses opposition, the United States may take unilateral action, but the United Nations must take over Japan when the U.S. military withdraws. The subcommittee believes that Japan is the most satisfactory region for them, and they praise the actions of the U.S. occupation authorities and the cooperative attitude of the Japanese. They believe that it is a "tragic mistake" for the United States to focus its attention on Europe and ignore China. They also urge President Truman to pay attention to this point, advocating giving the Chinese government more military supplies and training personnel. The report acknowledges that the Chinese government has corruption, but it is better than establishing a government in China that is hostile to the United States. If China falls into the hands of communism, it will inevitably affect the United States, and ultimately, the entire Far East and Pacific will be swallowed up by communism.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Advocates Military Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 21st] The New York Daily Mirror editorial on the 21st condemned "the Soviet Union's support for the Chinese civil war since 1924" and supported the Communist troops who even fought against the Chinese government during the war against Japan. The editorial pointed out that Roosevelt had tried to permanently unite Chairman Chiang with the CCP, and Truman and Marshall "are still in the shadows of Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam," also trying to create cooperation. "Chairman Chiang refused, because he knew that the CCP's collusion with the Soviet Union was a traitor to the motherland, and it has been so since 1920. Marshall's mediation almost destroyed China, because the mediation created the image of the United States encouraging communism, and strengthened the CCP's power. We stopped shipping all military supplies to China, while the Soviet Union continued to fund the CCP. At the same time, a large amount of military equipment in the Pacific region is increasingly decaying. If Chairman Chiang had this military equipment, he could do a lot - this is reasonable and practical assistance. However, the United States provides tens of millions of dollars to Europe, and does not mention this at all, perhaps because this kind of assistance does not cost much, or perhaps because the U.S. government's idea of foreign aid is to make the American people suffer heavy sacrifices."</p>
<h3>Peixian and Zaozhuang Recovered, Xuzhou Shortens Curfew Hours From Yesterday, No More Communist Bandits on the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou Section of the Longhai Railway</h3>

<h3>Chairman Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters in Writing: The Work of World Peace is Arduous, Our Preparation for Implementing Constitutionalism is Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang answered questions from United Press reporters in writing on the 21st: Seeking world peace is truly the most arduous task. I firmly believe that the establishment of the United Nations can gradually achieve the highest ideal of mankind, a global family. This is the most important progress of the 20th century. Any undertaking to improve the human condition must naturally undergo many difficult trials. It is not surprising that the United Nations encountered various difficulties in its early efforts to achieve world peace. But I deeply believe that if all member states can aim at the happiness of the entire world and place their national interests below it, then they will be able to mutually understand and work together to achieve a final solution to all current difficulties. Regarding the preparation for the general election and the implementation of constitutionalism, the Chairman declared: Our preparation for this major event is nearing completion, and the entire country must work hard to accelerate progress in all aspects. Our task today is no less than during wartime, and the difficulty of the environment has not diminished, but I sincerely hope that all the people will increase their determination to remove all obstacles that hinder the country from completing its reconstruction plan as soon as possible. The basic condition of democracy is the rule of law. Of course, all actions of government officials should be based on law, but the people should also learn to abide by the law. Only in this way can the democratic system have a sound and lasting foundation. The United Press reporter asked a total of five questions, and the Chairman answered two of them, and was unwilling to express opinions on the others.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Discusses Allied Reparations Claims, Our Proposal to Convene a Peace Conference Has Not Yet Been Discussed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The Far Eastern Commission did not discuss China's proposal to "request the eleven member states of the Far Eastern Commission to promptly hold a preliminary meeting for a peace conference with Japan" at its regular meeting on the 20th. According to authoritative sources, it is not appropriate for the Far Eastern Commission to discuss China's proposal at this time. What was discussed at today's meeting were more specialized issues such as the Allied reparations claims against Japan and Japanese industrial standards. According to a U.S. State Department official who told reporters, the Chinese government's note to the U.S. side reiterating its proposal to convene a preliminary peace conference with Japan is still under "active consideration" by the State Department. The State Department has not yet responded to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] It was learned today that the misconception among people in various countries here that the Allied powers in the Pacific were deadlocked on the issue of reparations from Japan was partially clarified last night due to the United States' new proposal on the proportion of reparations to the Commission. The United States also urged members of the Far Eastern Commission to request their governments to accept the proposal for the common happiness of the Allied powers, so as to remove the main obstacles to the recovery of Japanese industry and commerce. Authoritative sources claim that some countries have expressed their willingness to accept the new U.S. proposal so that the occupying authorities in Japan can immediately begin to implement the reparations work. However, the content of the new proposal is still kept strictly confidential. It is only known that China's share has always been the highest, and it will be significantly reduced in the future. As for the Philippines, its original share of 15% of the total reparations may remain unchanged, which the Philippine government is expected to accept. In addition, the original total percentage was about 200% of the value of Japanese reparations, which is said to be revised to 100%. The Far Eastern Commission also hopes to receive responses from the governments of the countries concerned in one or two weeks, so that a decision can be made at that time.</p>

<h3>Councillors of the Participating Political Council Suggest the Government Should Quickly Win Back Hearts and Minds: Property Tax Should First Be Levied on Senior Officials and the Wealthy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Councilor Wu Dunwu and others proposed at the meeting of the Resident Committee of the Political Council on the 21st that the government should quickly find ways to win back the hearts and minds of the people in order to quell the rebellion and build the country. It was resolved to send it to the government for practical consideration. The measures proposed in the case are: Quickly implement property tax, and first levy it on the property of senior military and political officials and people of status from all walks of life. Summon the children of senior military and political officials and leaders from all walks of life to join the military to quell the rebellion. Punish corrupt senior officials (especially those local military personnel who extort and embezzle, living like princes). Resolve to stabilize prices and severely punish national profiteers. Reduce the people's burden and abolish compulsory requisition and borrowing for a considerable period. Handle elections with caution and strictly prohibit manipulation, fraud, and bribery. As for the two cases proposed by Xue Mingjian and others to request the government to reward coal production and allocate all sales revenue to mine owners, and to request the government to save the crisis in the machine manufacturing industry, both were resolved to be submitted to a group for review. In addition, the case proposed by Yao Tingfang and others to request the central government to publicly commend the local teams of Zhenping, Neixiang, Zhechuan, Dengxian, and Nanyang counties in Henan to encourage morale and benefit the suppression of bandits was resolved to be submitted to the government for prompt handling. Also, the case proposed by Gan Jiaping and others to request the government to transfer the area north of Jiujiang, which originally belonged to Jiangxi, to the jurisdiction of Jiangxi to comply with public sentiment was resolved to be submitted to the government for handling.</p>

<h3>More Than 10,000 Communist Bandits Fled in the Battle of Yulin, Mi Xia's Corps Enters the City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 20th] The National Army from Ningxia aiding Yulin entered the city today, and the Communist bandits withdrew to the southeast.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yulin, 20th] There are no more bandits within forty miles of the outer park of Yulin. The remnants of the bandits in Sancha Bay and Beitaishan, after being pursued and suppressed by the National Army, were forced to flee towards the southeast.</p>

<h3>Where is France Going?</h3>
<p>While the US Congress is holding a special session to consider emergency aid plans for Europe, the situation in Europe, particularly in Germany, is becoming increasingly unstable. Strikes and disturbances are occurring in various parts of both France and Italy. In France, the Ramadier government finally succumbed and was overthrown, and Blum, a veteran of the Socialist Party, resumed the task of forming a cabinet. Simultaneously with this news, there came the order from the French president to recall 140,000 new soldiers. Amidst the turbulent situation in France, the fact that the French president entrusted Blum with forming a cabinet while also recalling new soldiers as a necessary military measure, is sufficient to show that the current situation in France seems indeed very critical. Blum's willingness to shoulder the burden of reorganizing a new cabinet at the age of seventy-five is admirable, but whether his efforts will achieve the desired stability for the future of France is a matter of concern for the world.</p>
<p>The reason why the situation in France has become increasingly turbulent, eventually leading to the collapse of the Ramadier cabinet, is not a simple one. From the direct and immediate perspective, France has been swept by a surging wave of labor unrest. Strikes resulting in bloodshed have occurred in places like Marseille, and the Ramadier cabinet, overwhelmed in dealing with the situation, had no choice but to announce its resignation. However, the labor unrest in France is less a dispute between employers and employees, and more accurately described as a political struggle. Its purpose is not merely to obtain higher wages and better treatment, but to deliberately create difficulties for the government. This is clearly a political action of struggle. The occurrence of this movement is, to some extent, a reaction to the unprecedented victory of the "Rally of the French People" in the recent French municipal elections. Its purpose is to incite unrest in various places, plunging general order into chaos, in an attempt to achieve the goal of seizing power. Even if this goal cannot be achieved, it can at least create temporary terror to facilitate future development. This is clearly a planned action, and undoubtedly, the Communist Party of France is behind it.</p>
<p>The emergence of this movement is certainly related to the victory of the "Rally of the French People" led by de Gaulle in the municipal elections. And the victory of the "Rally of the French People" is also related to the Communist Party of France. After the war, the influence of the Communist Party of France grew, and it seemed to regard itself as the number one political party in France. However, the "Popular Republican Movement" led by Foreign Minister Bidault also emerged in France as a new political party, enjoying popular support, and forming the left and right wings of French politics. The reason why the French political situation was able to be maintained in the past was because middle-ground parties, such as the Socialist Party, were able to seize opportunities, leaning left or right, to mediate. The Ramadier cabinet was centered on middle-ground parties, supplemented by the right-wing "Popular Republican Movement." However, with the "Popular Republican Movement" having lost the vast support of the masses it once had to the victory of the "Rally of the French People", it was expected that the Ramadier cabinet would inevitably encounter difficulties. If we consider the reason why the "Rally of the French People" led by de Gaulle was able to achieve a great victory in the municipal elections, the direct cause was that the French Communist Party had betrayed its country by joining the new Communist International, appearing in the guise of the "Communist Information Bureau," and willingly becoming a tool of Moscow. Since the declaration of the "Communist Information Bureau," the vigilance of the French people has been raised, and ultimately this vigilance has allowed the political group led by de Gaulle to achieve victory in the municipal elections. The French people, for the sake of their country, have placed their hopes on de Gaulle.</p>
<p>The unprecedented victory of the political group led by de Gaulle in the municipal elections immediately changed the French political landscape. The vast supporters of the "Popular Republican Movement" led by Foreign Minister Bidault have mostly shifted further to the right, joining the "Rally of the French People." Even the General Confederation of Labor of France, which has been controlled by the Communist Party of France and has six million members, has experienced a split, turning towards the "Rally of the French People." Today, this political group is undoubtedly supported by the majority of the French people. De Gaulle's stubbornness and self-will has been known to the French people, but the "Rally of the French People" represents a newly emerging force. Although de Gaulle is the leader, the core members are mostly former Communist Party members who are dissatisfied with the Communist Party, such as the famous writer Malraux. The victory of the "Rally of the French People" indicates that the trend of French politics shifting to the right is becoming increasingly clear. In this situation, we see Blum emerge and take on the heavy responsibility of forming a cabinet.</p>
<p>If Blum succeeds in forming a cabinet, it will undoubtedly be a transitional government. The question is, a transition to where? The fact that the right-wing "Rally of the French People" has great support is a fact, and it is expected that it may win the parliamentary elections next year. But whether the Blum cabinet will transition to de Gaulle remains to be seen. We should not forget that when the Communist International decided to organize the "Popular Front," Blum was the former leader of the "Popular Front" government; he had close ties with the Communist Party. The current political situation in France is different from the past, and the position of the Communist Party is also different. We have no way of knowing whether Blum can change his past attitude. But according to news reports, Blum's coming out to form a government seems to be a blow to the "Rally of the French People," which has great potential power. It is said that there are two factions within the so-called middle parties, one led by Blum, which advocates establishing a government that would make it impossible for de Gaulle to regain power; the other advocates establishing a transitional government, as a transitional mechanism between the current government and the de Gaulle government in early next year. Reynaud, who was once rumored to be forming a cabinet but failed, and is now rumored to be the deputy prime minister of the Blum cabinet, is the leader of this faction. Now that Blum has come out to form a government, it seems that it cannot be said that this is not a blow to the "Rally of the French People."</p>
<p>In short, since the de Gaulle faction won in the municipal elections, the left-right struggle within the French political situation has become increasingly acute, bordering on civil war. Blum, from the middle party, emerged to form a cabinet in order to avoid civil war. Whether civil war has been avoided, or whether it has instead intensified the struggle between the left and right factions, promoting civil war, depends on how the middle parties, especially a figure like Blum, conduct themselves. We hope that the middle parties can truly play a role in mediating between the left and right.</p>
<h3>Chu Chia-hua Reports on Educational Facilities</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Mr. Chu first stated that student unrest in various places is gradually subsiding. He analyzed that the causes of the student unrest were due to the youth's unease and also due to the pressure of life, which led to their frustration with the phenomena. He then stated that after the restoration, the primary task of education is to restore the pre-war state, but due to the heavy losses of the eight-year war of resistance, educational restoration is extremely difficult. For example, the lack of school buildings makes it difficult to restore them in the short term. In addition, the number of students has doubled, making the capacity of each school even more insufficient. Mr. Chu also stated that the salaries of faculty and staff and the public expenses of students have been gradually increased. However, due to the impact of fluctuating prices, life is still difficult. The research funding has increased from the initial five hundred yuan to one million yuan. The highest amount for college and university professors has also been increased to six hundred yuan. The student public expense was originally a temporary wartime measure, and the Executive Yuan has decided to cancel it and replace it with scholarships, but the original public expense students will still be retained. In order to take care of poor students, the government has also established a relief fund to assist young students in bandit areas. Mr. Chu believes that the lack of books and instruments is also one of the causes of educational unrest. He stated that the equipment in each school is indeed too poor. Although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly requested foreign exchange to add equipment to each school, the number is still limited. During the war, the United States allocated part of its loan to our country for schools to purchase equipment. The purchased goods have been delivered one after another. In addition, the Ministry of Education has also raised two or three hundred thousand volumes of books in England and the United States. Although the content is not very good, it is better than nothing. Furthermore, the United Nations Educational Organization has distributed hundreds of boxes of books to our country, including several sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which will be shipped soon. The books that were taken away by the Japanese during the war have now been found and transported back. Mr. Chu then gave a general report on international cultural cooperation, relief for refugee students, and textbooks. He finally stated that since the beginning of this semester, the situation in each school has been unexpectedly stable. Recently, there has been slight unrest at Zhejiang University, which is still caused by the Communists. The Yu Zisan case has now been sentenced by the court and should be coming to an end. Mr. Chu emphasized that education must take a stable path, because education is a century-long plan. Educational unrest affects politics, and political unrest can also affect education.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Factories and Mines Will Be Armed for Protection</h3>
<p>Sun Yuez-chi Flies to Comfort Employees</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's Peiping dispatch on the 21st) Factories and mines of the National Resources Commission in the Northeast and North China will not be moved elsewhere. The National Resources Commission will also consult with the military headquarters to arm strategic resource outposts to maintain production. Sun Yuez-chi, the deputy director of the National Resources Commission, told reporters that the suppression of the rebellion is different from the period of the War of Resistance. Today, there is no clear and absolute front and rear. The government also does not have the financial resources to dismantle and relocate these factories and mines elsewhere. Moreover, with the scarcity of resources in Jiangnan, it is not suitable to use large-scale industrial and mining machinery from the Northeast and North China. Mr. Sun continued that the National Resources Commission has implemented a policy of stubborn production. For example, after the fall of the Zibo Coal Mine in Shandong, employees were transferred to Qingdao and Jinan to await orders. When the mine was recovered, the employees returned on foot.

<h3>Relief for Northeastern Farmers, Workers and Youths: Various Departments Have Organized Programs</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanking, 21st) The Northeast Relief Association, headed by Madame Chiang, requested the Four Joint Offices, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education to organize agricultural loans, industrial loans, and distribute fertilizers, seeds, agricultural and industrial equipment, and establish university preparatory classes and temporary primary schools in order to provide relief for Northeastern farmers, workers and youths who have lost their schooling. It is reported that after receiving the association's request, the various agencies have organized programs within their respective jurisdictions.

<h3>Difficulties in Transporting Shaanxi Cotton Remain Numerous</h3>
<p>Transportation Issues Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 21st) The transportation of Shaanxi cotton is still facing numerous difficulties. The main problem is transportation. Air transport is not practically possible, and the Yu-Xi Highway cannot be repaired in the short term. The route from Xi'an via Hanzhong and down the Han River to the east has recently been blocked due to the Communist bandits disturbing the mountains. As for the route via the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway to Chongqing and then shipped out, not only is the route too long, but there are also limited vehicles. According to the person in charge of the Xi'an office of the China Textile Corporation, the office does not plan to purchase a large amount of Shaanxi cotton in the short term due to a lack of cash. More than 100,000 dan of cotton remain here waiting to be transported. Of the cotton that was transported out via the Longhai Railway three months ago, in addition to a portion lost in western Henan, most of it is still stranded in Xuzhou and has not yet been transported.</p>

<h3>Philippine Supreme Court Rules That Foreigners Cannot Own Land</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Are Most Affected</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 21st) The Philippine Supreme Court recently ruled by a vote of six to four that foreigners may not purchase land for residential use in the Philippines. According to the original provisions of the Philippine Constitution, foreigners may not purchase farmland or forests, but there is no explicit provision regarding ordinary land. However, the Ministry of Justice previously announced that foreigners who purchase ordinary land may register with the Land Registry, which is tantamount to acknowledging that foreigners have the right to purchase land. Today's ruling has made the Ministry of Justice's notification invalid. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court stated that the farmland and forests (public farmland) mentioned in the Constitution should also include "ordinary land for residential use." Foreigners have no right to purchase land at all. Foreigners in the Philippines are only residing temporarily. If they wish to reside permanently in the Philippines, they can obtain Philippine citizenship according to law and do not need to maintain their foreign status. The Supreme Court's ruling has greatly affected overseas Chinese. However, American nationals can still freely purchase all types of land in the Philippines and have the right to develop it due to the protection of the "Equal Rights" clause.</p>

<h3>In the Legal and Political Arena, A Matter of Life and Death, Blum Criticizes Party for Endangering Democracy, Demands Adoption of Centrist Path</h3>
<p>[Report by this Newspaper] London, [Day] Broadcast: Paris Dispatch, French Socialist [Name] Blum attended the National Assembly at 3:00 PM today, in high spirits and with great confidence. He will demand a vote of confidence from the National Assembly. Blum immediately delivered a speech stating: International Communism has openly declared war on French democratic politics. He hopes to organize a new centrist government, unite all people in the country who love the republican system, prevent dictatorship from either the left or right wing, and form an "international third force" to stop the increasing division between Western countries and the Soviet Union around the world. Like some European countries, we do not want to join any camp, but only seek stability. France's task is to form this kind of international centrist force to reduce international misunderstandings and suspicions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st Dispatch] With more than 700,000 workers on strike nationwide, the situation in France is extremely tense. The world is now watching how 75-year-old Blum will lead France through this serious crisis. Blum began negotiations with key political leaders on the 21st, attempting to form a strong and acceptable government. Observers believe that Blum's chances of success and failure are equal. The government's call-up of 150,000 reservists on the 20th is seen as an expression of the government's determination to maintain law and order by force, and to strike at strikers by force if necessary. According to various reports, the government has learned that the Communist Party has mobilized party members across the country in preparation for possible actions on the weekend. This report has not been officially confirmed. However, the Communist Party has indeed distributed a number of inflammatory manuals to the public, calling for "unity and action" to bring the Communist Party to rule France, and calling for the "establishment of committees to defend the Republic, defend industry, agriculture, and national independence" in various places. The Communist Party referred to Blum as a "tool" of de Gaulle and "American imperialists."</p>
<h3>Bloodshed in Italian Riots Continues, Cabinet Reorganization Talks in Progress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 21st Dispatch] It was learned today that following the strike in the Puglia region of southeastern Italy, bloody clashes occurred yesterday, resulting in three or four more deaths and at least thirteen injuries. Traffic was cut off at the scene. The most serious dispute occurred in Salentina, south of Brindisi in Lecce province.

A general strike was called in Bari, a major port on the Adriatic Sea, and in Taranto.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 20th Dispatch] The Italian left is attempting to overthrow the Gasperi cabinet by exploiting strikes and chaos. The rioting situation has slightly eased today, with no new incidents of bombings or assassinations. At the same time, Prime Minister Gasperi continued negotiations with moderate leaders of the left wing in an effort to broaden the base of the government. According to evening newspapers, most members of the anti-communist faction of the Socialist Party are in favor of joining the cabinet, and the position of Deputy Prime Minister may be held by the faction's leader, Saragat. Communist leader Togliatti attacked the Prime Minister in the party's newspaper, treating him as Mussolini. According to him, although Gasperi is not leading Italy back to fascism, he is leading the country back to reactionism.</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Policy Reaches Decisive Stage Next Summer</h3>
<p>Stettinius Calls on US to Maintain Strength</p>
<p>[United Press, St. Petersburg, Florida, 20th Dispatch] Republican presidential candidate Stettinius declared last night that after the Communist Party suffered setbacks in France and Italy, Soviet foreign policy will reach a decisive stage next summer.

<h3>Under the Communist Iron Heel, People Will Eventually Break Free from Chains, Hoover Discusses "Two Worlds"</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 20th Dispatch] Former US President Hoover delivered a speech at the annual banquet of the Netherlands Society here tonight, stating that he cannot help but believe that the people under the communist iron heel will eventually break free from their chains. Repeated purges are sufficient proof of the unrest in the communist-controlled areas. The fifth column is active all over the world and must be constantly dealt with. The Soviet Union and communism are a huge shadow over the future of the world. We are now divided into two worlds, one maintaining atheism and wanting to enslave humanity, the other maintaining religious faith and advocating human freedom. The countries of the Western Hemisphere are showing that free enterprise is the only way to increase production. Today, only countries with free enterprise can avoid hunger and cold. Of all the materials shipped overseas to relieve Europe and Asia, 95% comes from the massive production of free enterprise countries. If the Western Hemisphere also followed the economic utopia of Eastern and Western Europe, I dare say that not a ton of wheat or a lump of coal would be shipped abroad.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seattle, 20th Dispatch] Famous explorer and scientist Stevens declared today that the number of people colonized by the Soviet Union near the Arctic Ocean is many times greater than the white population of Alaska. The Soviet authorities plan to design and build several industrial cities there. One was completed during the war and now has 40,000 residents. The Soviet Union's expansion to the Arctic Circle is not kept secret, and is recorded in scientific journals. This colonization aims to build a self-sufficient society in order to absorb more people for migration, but it is also the best preparation for wartime.</p>

In recent years, national ideas have flourished, and Britain has been guiding these ideas into constructive paths, helping them to take on greater responsibility for their own affairs.</p>

To date, a total of about 600 representatives from 40 countries have registered, and there are many obstacles ahead.

<h3>Marshall Arrives in London, Emphasizes Reiteration of Demand for Merger of Saar Region</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall arrived here in London from Washington today to prepare for next week's Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Marshall reiterated that his position was not pessimistic, but did not make any other comments.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th Dispatch] Marshall visited former Secretary of State Byrnes before his departure today, talking for about an hour and a half, which aroused speculation. This is because Byrnes had advocated that if the Soviet Union continued to obstruct the Foreign Ministers Conference from reaching an agreement, the Western countries should conclude a separate peace treaty with Germany. But whether Marshall agreed with this view was not made clear by himself or other officials. President Truman personally went to the airport to see him off, wishing him all the best on his trip.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that when Foreign Minister Bidault leaves for London next Monday to attend the Foreign Ministers Conference that begins on Tuesday, he will bring a four-point plan regarding Germany, namely: 1. Reorganize Germany on a federal basis; 2. Economic unification of Germany; 3. Genuine control of the Ruhr area; 4. The merger of Saar into the French economic system. The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the outside world is too pessimistic about this Foreign Ministers Conference, as the failure of this conference is not inevitable. France does not intend to sacrifice the absolute need for European security, and will therefore insist on the aforementioned four points. France will also propose the establishment of an expert committee to investigate how, after the completion of the reconstruction of Germany's economic unification, the extraction of reparations and the balancing of Germany's international balance of payments can be prevented from conflicting. France is firmly opposed to raising Germany's industrial level for the purpose of extracting reparations. In other words, France will never prioritize reparations over the security of Europe.</p>

The matter may be submitted to the Foreign Ministers Conference next week for discussion. The Lobau refinery is the largest in Austria and was jointly invested in by Britain and the United States. It was occupied by the German side after the German-Austrian merger in 1938, and was subsequently confiscated by the Soviet Union, which considered the oil field to be German-owned and treated it as German property.</p>

According to Sandler, he is one of Sweden's representatives to the UN General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Sends Note to Iran Protesting Destruction of Oil Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 21st Dispatch] The Soviet government has notified Iran that the cancellation of the 1946 oil agreement with the Soviet Union is an anti-Soviet action, and the Iranian government bears full responsibility for it. The note was presented to the Iranian government by Soviet Ambassador to Tehran Sakikov. Diplomatic circles in London believe that this matter "has a serious impact on the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, which has little hope of success," and said that this is one of the Soviet Union's diplomatic pressures.</p>

<h3>The Rampant Communist Forces in the Far East Require US Restraint: Senator Magnuson's Plea</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 20th] Democratic Senator Magnuson told reporters today that while he supports President Truman's aid-to-Europe plan, measures should also be taken to prevent the spread of communism in the Far East.

<h3>Next Year's UN General Assembly to Be Held in Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] The United Nations General Assembly recently approved the UN budget by a vote of 37 to 0, including $1,047,875 to support holding the General Assembly outside the United States, thus ensuring a meeting in Europe. Ten countries abstained, including China, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Syria, and six Slavic nations. British Foreign Office Minister McNeil declared that he would no longer insist on a two-thirds majority vote but still opposed the excessive size of the budget; China also adopted the same position. Due to the change in attitude of China and the United Kingdom, the budget was passed. After consultation with Secretary-General Lie, the nine-nation committee will select a venue for the conference in Europe, possibly Paris or Geneva.  The joint proposal by Brazil, Belgium, Cuba, and Denmark was rejected as it failed to secure a majority vote with 31 in favor, 19 against, and six abstentions.</p>
<h3>Austrian Currency Reform</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 21st] The Austrian government's anti-inflation law, which stipulates that three schilling banknotes (old currency) be exchanged for one schilling banknote (new currency), has sparked protests from trade unions across the country, especially in the southern provinces. The Communist Central Committee has ordered its members to unite and resist this act of robbing the people. Strikes and protest rallies have been occurring in various places, especially in factories controlled by the Russians. It is said that the Soviet authorities allow personnel in the enterprises they control to fully redeem their old schilling banknotes for new ones. The Ministry of Interior today ordered that shops which close down to avoid selling goods will never be allowed to reopen or will be fined 50,000 schillings, and people who refuse to accept schillings will be sentenced to five years in prison or fined 500,000 schillings.</p>
<h3>New Partition Plan for Palestine: British Statement Refuses to Accept, Opposes Gradual Transfer of Power</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] The British government today rejected the proposal by the United Nations General Assembly's Palestine Committee's subcommittee on partition to entrust the administration of Palestine to a United Nations committee during the transition period. British representative Cadogan told the Palestine Committee that since Britain still holds the mandate during the transition period, the British government would not allow a dual authority in Palestine. Even under normal, stable political conditions, the duplication of political mechanisms would be a dangerous phenomenon, and in Palestine, it would obviously have serious consequences.</p>
<p>Therefore, the British government must solemnly declare that for as long as Britain continues to hold the mandate, the British government will insist on exercising indivisible control in Palestine. Cadogan further stated that the British government could not wait for the Security Council to revoke its mandate in Palestine. The British government could not accept the subcommittee's recommendation for a gradual transfer of power from the mandatory authority to a provisional government committee, and the Palestinian authorities would not allow any activities within their control areas that could incite unrest. Cadogan also stated the extent to which Britain is prepared to participate in the implementation of a settlement acceptable to both Jewish and Arab parties, which had been detailed by British Colonial Secretary Jones. After Cadogan finished speaking, the members of the partition subcommittee on the committee were shocked because Cadogan's statement had clearly overturned several important plans proposed by the partition subcommittee. The chairman of the partition subcommittee, Poland's Pruszyński, immediately suggested adjourning the meeting so that each representative could consult their respective governments, and it was decided to resume the meeting next Monday afternoon.</p>
<h3>South Africa and India Dispute: UN General Assembly Rejects Indian Proposal</h3>

<h3>Japanese Military Intelligence Chief Defends Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>

<h3>All-Out Brawl in Japanese House of Representatives; Coal Mine Nationalization Bill Passed Despite Unresolved Disputes Within Industry and Mining Committee</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st]  The plenary session of the Japanese House of Representatives today was extremely tense due to the vote on the coal mine nationalization bill, with all members of both the ruling party and the opposition party in attendance. The opposition party suddenly disregarded the rules of the Diet's opening time, rushing to enter the venue in order to control advantageous seats and pre-emptively set up positions, causing great disorder. As a result, the Liberal Party was not allowed to vote. The vote tally was 170 in favor and 72 against. The Liberal Party protested against the unfair treatment.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 21st]  Members of the Japanese House of Representatives engaged in a fistfight on the floor for forty minutes yesterday, with members of the government party, the Communist Party, the opposition, and parliamentary guards joining in, but no injuries were reported. Initially, some members claimed that there was not a sufficient quorum and refused to start the meeting. Speaker Komakichi Matsuoka checked the number of attendees, announced that there was a quorum, and ordered the full text of the coal mining bill to be read, which caused the commotion, followed by fistfights. After forty minutes, leaders of each party ordered those involved to retreat to the sidelines.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st]  After the adjournment of the House Industry and Mining Committee on the 21st, the 16 opposition committee members convened again and proposed a motion of no confidence against Committee Chairman Ushiro Ito, which was passed. Those who supported the motion based their arguments on the Diet Law, which stipulates that the committee chairman has the right to convene and adjourn meetings, and did not recognize the committee resolution after Ito announced the adjournment. The Cabinet Secretariat has not yet issued any opinion.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Election Day One: Approximately 5-600,000 Votes Cast, Voting Order Mostly Good Throughout the City</h3>
<h3>Mayor Votes to Elect Speaker</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 8:20 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu personally went to the fourth polling station in Changshu District (Zhaoguang Middle School) to vote for Speaker Pan Gongzhan as a National Assembly representative.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 8 AM yesterday morning, whistles blared from factories throughout the city, marking the start of the first National Assembly representative election in our nation's history. Voting took place in 260 polling stations. Citizens were able to maintain calm and vote in accordance with the law, without affecting their daily lives. The candidates continued to work hard to win votes at this critical time, with campaign vehicles speeding along the streets and elaborately printed materials being distributed in large quantities, forming a prominent sight during the election. The starting times varied at the various polling stations. Areas with high population density had people voting continuously from 8 AM onwards, while locations that were more secluded remained deserted until after 9 AM. By 7 PM last night, the election office had received reports from various locations, indicating that voter participation was more enthusiastic in the suburbs, with the Longhua District having over 20,000 voters. Voter turnout in the city was not as high as expected. The likely reason is that yesterday was not a holiday, and most citizens were at the office and did not have time to vote. Voter numbers may increase significantly in the next two days. According to relevant personnel who inspected the voting areas at around 4 PM yesterday, the highest number of votes cast at a polling station was 4,000, and the lowest was 1,000. It is estimated that voters accounted for about 20% of the total electorate, which is about 5-600,000 people. There was considerable security at each polling station, and the order was generally well maintained throughout the day, except for minor disputes in a few areas.</p>
<p>At 10:20 AM yesterday morning, Speaker Pan and his wife, Ms. Guang Guanyu, went to the seventh polling station in Jing'an District at the Central Photographic Factory on Haige Road to vote. After presenting his electoral right certificate, the administrator verified that he should vote at the sixth polling station on Guba Road. Mr. Pan then went to the sixth polling station with his wife, stamped and obtained ballots, and completed the voting process at 10:35 AM. On the ballots, Mr. Pan and his wife personally wrote "Jin Zhenyu".</p>
<h3>District Residents Request Supplementary Election Certificates; Teacher Found with Blank Ballots</h3>
<p>During yesterday's election, order problems occurred in the following locations: Around 9:30 AM, over 300 voters who had not received their electoral right certificates surrounded the district office in the 17th District of North Sichuan Road, requesting supplementary certificates. The district office staff then came forward to negotiate, and representatives from the voters, Fu Changqing and Sun Wenbing, explained the reasons, stating that the 20th Bao, 8th Bao, 14th Bao, and 16th Bao of the district had not fully issued the certificates. The Baojia heads had not notified residents to pick up their certificates in advance, and when residents went to pick up the certificates, those with lower levels of education often could not get them. They requested clarification on the actual situation of the certificate issuance and the reissue of electoral right certificates. Around 11 AM, Deputy District Head Qiu Xisheng came to the district office and explained the various difficulties caused by the lack of enthusiasm among voters in picking up their certificates, and promised to forward the voters' representatives' opinions to the Civil Affairs Bureau. This matter was resolved in the afternoon, with voters bringing their national ID cards to obtain supplementary electoral right certificates. At the fifth polling station in North Station, at 11 AM, a child of only 12 or 13 years old suddenly broke in, loudly supporting Gu Jinzao as a National Assembly representative. The police ordered him to leave for disrupting order. At this time, a teacher surnamed Lou from Tianwen Elementary School in Hongkou intervened in the police's actions. The police, suspicious of his behavior, questioned and searched him, and found as many as 72 blank ballots on him, which he had obtained from the students' families. Because he violated the election regulations, he has been sent to the police station for investigation. At the fourth polling station in Xin Jing, at 3:30 PM, voting was temporarily suspended for half an hour due to poor order, and resumed at 4 PM.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Bureau Explains Electoral Right Certificate Issues</h3>
<p>In other polling stations, there were also instances of voters disputing with Bao secretaries because they could not obtain their electoral right certificates. Voters accused the Bao of deliberately not issuing electoral right certificates, while Bao secretaries said that voters often did not bring their personal seals to the Bao office to pick up the certificates, and the Bao office only had one secretary, who could not deliver electoral right certificates to hundreds of households in the Bao. However, according to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the election is divided into regional and occupational categories. If the household registration of a regional Bao belongs to people in the industrial, commercial, educational, and freelance professions, their electoral right certificates should be obtained from the respective organizations. The district Bao should first exclude these to avoid the malpractice of double voting. As for households that have moved in for less than six months, have not registered with the Baojia, or have not obtained ID cards, they will naturally not be able to fill out and issue electoral right certificates. This is also one of the reasons why the number of electoral right certificates issued by each Baojia is relatively small.</p>
<h3>Speaker Pan Hopes City Government Will Issue a Proclamation: Agencies, Factories, and Schools to Have Half-Day Holiday Today, Several Reasons for Citizen Apathy Towards Elections</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday's voting situation was generally in good order, but both Chinese and foreign observers felt that citizens seemed somewhat indifferent to the election. One reason may be that this is the first nationwide general election in China's history, and people are not yet accustomed to it. Another reason may be that life is difficult after the war, and prices are high, so people are busy dealing with daily necessities and have little political interest. Moreover, the election period originally lasted three days. Yesterday was the first day, and there was no holiday, so most citizens with jobs found it difficult to find time to vote. It is expected that today, Saturday afternoon, and tomorrow morning, Sunday, may see more enthusiastic participation. It is rumored that Speaker Pan will suggest to Mayor Wu that a proclamation be issued this afternoon, Saturday, to grant a half-day holiday to all agencies, schools, and factories to facilitate voters casting their ballots (as democratic advanced countries usually have holidays during elections), and that the voting deadline for tomorrow (23rd), Sunday, be extended to 6 PM. It is unknown whether the mayor will approve this.</p>
<h3>Voting Through Open and Legal Procedures Is the Glory of Shanghai Citizens: Speaker's Broadcast Speech at the City Council Radio Station</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan rushed back to the city from Beijing yesterday morning to participate in the vote. At 10:30 AM, Mr. Pan and his wife, Ms. Tang Guanyu, went to the polling station at the Fumin Road Guba Apartment to vote. He then went to the City Council Radio Station to broadcast a speech, stating: "Fellow citizens: Today is the day when the Chinese people exercise their electoral rights as masters of the country. Not only is Shanghai holding the election today, but it is also being held enthusiastically throughout the country. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country, attracting international attention. I hope that Shanghai citizens will make a wonderful showing in this election. I would like to explain three points to all fellow citizens:</p>
<p>I hope everyone will vote in person. All citizens of this city who are 20 years of age or older, who have resided in this city for more than six months, and who have obtained household registration have the right to vote. Everyone should use their electoral right certificates to go to the designated polling stations at any time during these three days, from today to noon on the 23rd. Do not give up or avoid it. Because voting is the right of the master of the country, but it is also our responsibility. Assuming that there are two million voters in Shanghai, except for those who cannot vote due to illness or other unavoidable circumstances, I hope that everyone can personally cast the vote to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>The method should be absolutely free. During these three days, the method by which voters vote should be absolutely free, open, and legal. In other words, voting under free, open, and legal procedures is the glory of Shanghai citizens. We do not want to see anything happen that exceeds the scope of the law, and we do not want to hear of anyone using threatening means to hold our voters hostage or deprive voters of their right to vote. We want to encourage all candidates to use open, aboveboard methods and legal means to campaign and win the trust of citizens. If a voter cannot write, as long as you report the name of the person you want to elect, you can ask someone to write it for you; If the scribe refuses to write it for you, or persuades you to give up, or does not write it according to your wishes, this is not allowed.</p>
<p>Never Give Up Your Rights. For the election, I hope that Shanghai can reap good results under the open competition of various parties and social elites, with excellent National Assembly representatives that include all aspects, who can speak for the people, supervise the government on behalf of the people, protect the constitution, and elect an ideal president, so that all future measures of the government can truly embark on the road of democracy. The country must embark on the road of democracy in this new trend, starting from the local grassroots, to become a modern country and permanently maintain its honor. We hope that politics will be clear, the people will be happy, and the country will be prosperous and peaceful. Everyone must pay attention to this election and never give up their rights! I rushed back to Shanghai from Nanjing this morning for the purpose of casting my own vote. Because this is a very serious matter, if everyone thinks that missing his/her vote does not matter, then the polling stations will be deserted, the results of the election will certainly not be satisfactory, and it will also indicate that citizens are not enthusiastic about national affairs and are not qualified to be masters of the country. Isn't this a very shameful thing? So everyone must understand that the right to vote is as precious as one's life and property."</p>
<p>Brief Speech at the Hukwang Theater. After Mr. Pan's speech, he received a phone call from a citizen in Songshan District asking about the situation of not receiving the electoral right certificate, and he explained it on the radio station.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Mr. Pan gave a five-minute public speech to the audience at the Hukwang Theater at 4:30 PM yesterday to encourage citizens to vote enthusiastically. It was originally scheduled for him to give a speech at the Golden Grand Theater at 9 PM yesterday evening, but it was canceled due to other important business.</p>
<h3>Unified Allocation of Gasoline, Decision to Form a Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In this city, in addition to the rational allocation of gasoline for automobile use being the responsibility of the Public Utilities Bureau, there has been no competent authority to rationally allocate gasoline for industrial use or other purposes. In view of the need for gasoline among citizens and the difficulty in applying for it, Mayor Wu has decided to establish the Shanghai Gasoline Review Committee in the shortest possible time, with representatives from relevant agencies serving as committee members. In addition to overseeing gasoline for heavy use, agencies in need can submit applications to the committee, which will be handled fairly after review by the committee. It is learned that Mayor Wu has telephoned Zhang Jiaao, the president of the Central Bank, to discuss everything. In the future, the city's gasoline will be handled by the committee in a unified manner.</p>
<h3>New Prices for Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone to Be Implemented Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The price adjustments for the four major public utilities in this city, namely tap water, electricity, gas, and telephone, have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be implemented from today. The new prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Tap Water: 5,200 yuan per cubic meter for the British and French companies. 6,280 yuan per cubic meter for the Mainland, Zhabei, and Pudong companies.</p>
<p>Electricity: 4,650 yuan per kilowatt-hour for the Shanghai and Huxi power companies. 5,725 yuan per kilowatt-hour for the French Electricity Company. 5,980 yuan per kilowatt-hour for the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. 5,975 yuan per kilowatt-hour for the Chinese and Pudong power companies.</p>

<p>The above rates will be implemented from meter readings on November 22nd. The City Government hopes that this rate adjustment will be maintained until the end of this year. The impact on trams, buses, ferries, etc. is small and will not be adjusted.</p>
<h3>Lighting Candles, Writing Ballots; Professional Groups Enthusiastic About Electing National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The election of National Assembly representatives from professional groups proceeded very enthusiastically yesterday. Due to the sound organization of the various groups, the atmosphere during the voting was enthusiastic and the order was well-maintained. Except for a portion of the workers in the labor unions, the rest were able to write their own ballots. The situation at the various polling stations varied slightly due to the different number of voters. Among the various freelance professions, the Chinese Physicians Association only had over 1,800 eligible voters, so the third polling station at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association was particularly deserted yesterday. The pharmacists' (students') association only had three candidates, Shi Zhifu, Chen Pu, and others, so the voting situation was very calm. As the lawyers' association had a more uniform level of education, the order at the second polling station on Gongbo South Road was excellent. As for the women's group elections, at the first polling station for national women's groups at the Yuyuan Road Yuyuan Cafe, a total of four groups participated in the election, including the Chinese Women's Political Research Association, the Women's Welfare Mutual Aid Society, the Women's Gongming Society, and the Women's Home Economics Research Association. By last night, over 10,000 voters had completed their voting. Local women's groups such as the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association and the Shanghai Women's Association had over 4,000 people participating in the voting at the Changshu District Office on Baojian Road yesterday. More people voted for Tian Shujun there. The Women's Construction Association also had over 3,000 people participating in the voting at the fifth polling station on Changning Road. Most of them voted for Zhang Hongwei there. In the above locations, candles were lit and lamps were set up temporarily after dark to allow voters to write their ballots. Before 6 PM, voters were still coming in an endless stream, and it is expected to be even more enthusiastic today.</p>
<h3>Campaigning Becomes Increasingly Intense</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday was the first day of the National Assembly representative election in this city, and the candidates' campaigning became increasingly enthusiastic and intense. The election platforms announced by the candidates and the candidates supported by the various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Jin Zhenyu frankly announced her election platform yesterday: Promote free education for women and break the concept of valuing men over women.

<h3>Half an Hour of Gunfire in Western Shanghai – Major Melee – One Thief Killed – Mr. 馬伯樂 Fortunately Suffers No Loss – Family Greatly Frightened</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At approximately 5:40 PM yesterday afternoon, at the garden villa located at 150 Fanyu Road in Western Shanghai, the home of Mr. 馬伯樂, manager of the Palm Olive Soap Factory, eight or nine bandits suddenly arrived. Several bandits stood guard outside the gate, while the rest entered the house, first closing the iron gate, then binding the masters and servants with ropes, forbidding them from making any noise. At that moment, a patrol team from the Changning Road Police Sub-Bureau passed by and noticed several individuals standing outside the gate who clearly were not of good character. They went forward to investigate, but the individuals immediately opened fire, resisting arrest. The patrol police also drew their weapons and returned fire, while simultaneously telephoning the sub-bureau to report the situation. Sub-Bureau Chief Shao Yuanbin personally led Section Chief Shi Jieren, officers Wei Jinquan, Gu Kunqi, and a large number of uniformed police and volunteer police in police vehicles, rushing to surround and capture the bandits. The bandits, positioned inside, fired downwards from a high vantage point using both automatic and semi-automatic rifles, spraying bullets like beads. Chief Shao immediately ordered his officers to scatter and return fire from a distance. The two sides fought for about half an hour, exchanging more than fifty shots. As a result, one bandit, approximately thirty years old and dressed in work clothes, was struck twice in the back of the head and fell dead on the ground. A semi-automatic rifle and one bullet were found next to him. The remaining bandits all escaped through the back door. The corpse of the dead bandit was later transported to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, then transferred to the coroner's office for examination. Afterwards, police officers recovered six or seven 8-inch Mauser bullets in the vicinity, which were taken back to the bureau and filed. As for the 馬伯樂 residence, they were fortunate to not have any property stolen, but the fright they experienced was beyond description.</p>

<h3>"Black Goods" in Guizhou: 158 Drug Traffickers Apprehended in Two Months</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Correspondent in Guiyang, 12th] When I was in Sichuan, I heard of Guizhou's "Sour Smoke." After arriving in Guiyang for two months, I still haven't figured out what "Sour Smoke" is, as there are conflicting accounts. During the War of Resistance, "Ding Goods" were quite famous in Guiyang. I know what "Ding Goods" are, but I'm afraid I can't speak about them. In short, during the War of Resistance, when the nation and its people suffered so much, drug prohibition cases were handed over to military tribunals, and people were routinely imprisoned, shot, or beheaded. Yet, people in Guizhou still dared to bet their lives on smoking, transporting, selling, and growing opium. Now that victory has been achieved and drug prohibition cases are being transferred to the courts, which the gentlemen praise as "release ponds," in this glorious age, if people don't indulge in smoking, transporting, selling, and growing opium, then those so-called gentlemen under that "B" will laugh at them as the biggest fools!</p>
<h3>Purchasing Rotten Soil for Medicine</h3>
<p>Don't tell me that Guizhou isn't implementing drug prohibition? That's not true. Our Republic of China started implementing drug prohibition as early as 1840, when it was still the "Great Qing Empire." One hundred and six years of drug prohibition history is certainly not short, and the immense losses suffered due to drug prohibition are certainly not small. Unfortunately, those who prohibited did so while those who smoked continued to smoke. The prohibitions didn't apply to officials, only to the common people. The aim was to make money, and prohibition was just a means. Otherwise, why was there talk of "Ding Goods" during the War of Resistance? Why did a provincial assemblyman question the government in March about why it was purchasing five or six hundred taels of opium-containing soil at the official price and selling it to private individuals to make medicine!</p>
<p>Let's rely on official reports. At the provincial assembly meeting held in March, the provincial chairman's policy report discussed the eradication of drug use, stating: "Our province has strictly investigated and suppressed opium seedlings in recent years. The area of clandestine cultivation by rogue elements has decreased year by year. Last year, to advance the eradication of drug use, we drafted the 'Plan for Eradicating Drug Use' and issued a notice for its implementation. In September of last year, we strictly ordered all commissioners and county chiefs to thoroughly investigate, and in November we sent drug prohibition supervisors to various districts and counties to jointly conduct on-site inspections." What were the results? "Except for a very small number of remote areas in Anlong, Yanhe, Changshun, Ceheng, and Bijie counties, where clandestine cultivation existed, which were immediately destroyed, no opium seedlings were found in any other counties." This is Guizhou Province's plan for prohibiting cultivation and its implementation.</p>
<h3>Overview of Drug Transport and Opium Dens</h3>
<p>The report went on to discuss the transport and sale of drugs and the establishment of opium dens: "The transport and sale of drugs and the establishment of opium dens are still being strictly investigated and suppressed by county and municipal governments and police agencies in conjunction with military police." What were the results? "From January to December of the 35th year of the Republic, a total of 5,481 taels of raw opium, 6 taels and 1 qian of opium paste, 137 taels and 1 qian of opium ash, and 1,378 taels and 5 qian of fake opium were seized (excluding the 424 catties of opium seized from Yu Zixun and others by the Guiyang Municipal Police Bureau). Also, on the '63' Drug Prohibition Day in the 35th year, various agencies burned a total of 291 opium pipes, 317 opium lamps, and 2,708 other items." Chairman Yang is a believer who "doesn't smoke or drink." He is a straightforward person with a military style. During his three years in Guizhou, he often used the phrase, "This matter is worth fighting for, I must do it!" for any policy that he considered essential to implement. He has hated opium since he was a child. Whether in the military or in politics, he has always been an enemy of opium. However, today's Guizhou is still awash in a black tide, showing that drug prohibition is not easy to thoroughly implement.</p>
<h3>Main Causes of the Black Tide</h3>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation and inquiries, the main reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>The profits from drugs are greater than any other business except kidnapping. Lawless profiteers are willing to risk their lives and refuse to sever ties with opium. Since the victory, drug cases have been transferred from military tribunals to the courts. The courts require evidence and legal provisions for everything, and those involved with opium generally believe that they now have a way out.</p>
<p>Although the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Use" promulgated by the government during the War of Resistance were vigorously enforced, after the victory, the government may have felt that the penalties in the original regulations were too lenient, and therefore explicitly abolished them. However, the newly drafted regulations were not promulgated at the same time as the abolition, leading the ignorant people and veteran drug users to mistakenly believe that the government had abandoned drug prohibition. Otherwise, why would the "Punishment" regulations be abolished!</p>
<p>The subsequent "Regulations for Punishing Drug Use" set the maximum fine at 10,000 yuan, leading the ignorant people and veteran drug users who were unaware that violating drug prohibition could result in both imprisonment and fines to mistakenly believe that as long as they paid the maximum fine of 10,000 yuan, they could continue to smoke and forget their worries.</p>
<p>Guizhou has a long history with opium. In addition, neighboring provinces such as Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan are also very interested in opium. Not only is the supply endless, but they also compete with each other to grow opium in areas where their borders intersect, never showing weakness. Years of tradition have fostered the belief that "it's not illegal." In every area, there are always some people with special power who see themselves as being above the law and can smoke, transport, sell, and grow opium at will. The government is hesitant to be too thorough for fear of causing a greater disturbance, so drug use flourishes and there are more and more imitators. Is the difficulty of prohibiting, eliminating, and promoting drug prohibition unique to Guizhou?</p>
<h3>The Vast Opium Gang</h3>
<p>The main route for transporting opium into Guizhou is from Yunnan. Opium from Yunnan is generally called "Southern Soil." It is said that its potency is second only to India's "Old Man's Head." The second source is southwestern Guizhou, the eight counties of Panjiang, including Xingren and Xingyi, as well as Anlong, Xingshi, and Wangmo. It is said that Xingyi County was formerly known as "Huangcaoba." The opium produced in that area is generally called "Ba Soil," which is of course far inferior to "Southern Soil" in color, aroma, and taste. Whether it is "Southern Soil" or "Ba Soil," it generally comes to Guiyang along the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway and then is distributed from Guiyang to Xiangxi in the east and eastern Sichuan in the north. Along this route, people traveling by car or on foot, passing through checkpoints, are truly numerous and the business is booming. To be honest, in the Yunnan and western Guizhou areas, it is said that it is not uncommon for households to secretly store several dan of opium.</p>
<h3>More Than Double the Profit</h3>
<p>The current market price of "Southern Soil" in Kunming is "only" around 300,000 yuan per tael, and the goods are genuine and the weight is accurate. For large customers, the seller can even arrange for it to be smuggled out of the country. As soon as it arrives in Guiyang, "Southern Soil" can more than double in price (the market price in Guiyang is around 700,000 yuan per tael). It is small in size, has no odor, and is very convenient to carry. Therefore, the "Joint Inspection Station for Suppressing Drug Use" at the Sanqiao Station outside Guiyang's southern suburbs has been strictly investigating since it began operating on August 23rd. In just two months, from August 23rd to October 23rd, they have continuously apprehended 158 male and female drug traffickers and seized 317 catties and 258 taels and 5 qian of opium. It is said that Zhijiang in Hunan recently seized a batch of opium coming from Guiyang that weighed over 800 catties! What an astonishingly large number!</p>
<p>These male and female drug traffickers are becoming increasingly inventive in their smuggling techniques. The common method of openly and boldly walking through the checkpoint with drugs in their pockets is mostly done by men who appear to be soldiers but aren't.</p>
<h3>Women Smuggle on Horseback</h3>
<p>As for the women, they often use the method of "smuggling on horseback," concealing drugs in their menstrual belts and trying to pass through the checkpoint. Some wrap the opium in oilskin and place it in seemingly unimportant baskets or in children's clothes or diapers. For large-scale smuggling, they inevitably hide it in tires, seats, roofs, oil drums, or double-layered suitcases. Some take advantage of not being inspected and safely transport large quantities of opium to their destination. There are also many female drug traffickers who dress luxuriously and elegantly, as if they were noble ladies or daughters of wealthy families. They use this attire as camouflage and use various clever tricks and agile skills to carry large quantities of opium past the inspection net. They are so elusive and unpredictable that inspectors are deceived or feel overwhelmed and let them pass.</p>
<p>Sacrificing husbands for wealth is a classic warning. In recent years, Guizhou Province authorities have executed many drug traffickers, and there are countless drug traffickers currently imprisoned throughout the province. However, where there is profit, people will flock to it. These days, life is difficult, and too many people have a gambler's mentality. Unless the problem is solved by fundamentally improving politics, promoting economic prosperity, and ensuring equitable distribution, the "Drug Prohibition Year" will be seen as just another stage in the drug prohibition campaign!

<h3>Changshu Imposes Emergency Martial Law for Three Days; Heavy Troops Stationed at Key Points Along the River</h3>
<p>[Report from our Changshu Office, 19th] In order to consolidate its defenses, the Changshu Security Bureau has imposed a three-day emergency martial law starting from the 19th. Security at the city gates has been strengthened, and spot checks will be conducted at any time. The curfew has been moved earlier, from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning.

It has also been learned that water and land transportation will be controlled during the martial law period. Those who take the opportunity to disrupt public order will be killed without pardon, and those who create rumors will be immediately arrested. Furthermore, it is reported that County Magistrate Zhang went to the Shazhou District's Twelve Forts yesterday to preside over the joint defense meeting of the three counties. At the request of the Sha Tian Management Committee of Seven Forts, he went to Seven Forts for inspection together with Jiangyin County Magistrate Xu and others.</p>

If township Bao Tian personnel are found to have colluded with bandits, they will be executed immediately upon verification.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Soldier Suffering from Mental Illness Unauthorizedly Started a Train at the Meichi Station; Shou Honghan Transferred to the Hangzhou District Procuratorate for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 20th] On the afternoon of the 17th, when a Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway passenger train arrived from Shangrao to Hangzhou and the driver got off to rest at Meichi Station, a man named Shou Honghan suddenly broke into the engine room and started the machine, driving the train directly north. There were more than five hundred passengers in each carriage, and the order was in chaos for a while. The personnel in the station were also very frightened. They urgently notified the police department to raise the red warning flag light at Xingshan Station, but it was also ineffective. Fortunately, there was no branching or oncoming traffic on that section of the railway, so a major disaster was avoided. Later, the passenger train stopped half a kilometer away from Linpu Station. The police department then pursued, captured, and detained Shou, and transferred him to the Hangzhou District Procuratorate for interrogation on the 19th. According to his confession, he is an unemployed soldier and seems to be suffering from mental illness. Whether Shou's actions have any other purpose is still under investigation by the relevant authorities.</p>

<h3>Tiger-Fighting Hero Delves Deep into the Tiger's Lair; Eradicates Tiger Plague Single-Handedly in the Mountains of Shunchang for Fifty Days</h3>
<p>[Report from our Fuzhou Office, 15th] Tigers in Shunchang, Fujian, devour people, causing great suffering, as reported earlier by Yang Yangyi, a technician from the Provincial Research Institute who went to eliminate them. Now, Mr. Yang has returned to Rong from Chang, talking freely about his tiger-fighting experience, which is extremely terrifying and dangerous, just like a newly compiled "Tiger-Fighting Biography." The details are described truthfully as follows. In the past half year, the entire county of Shunchang has been in the terror of the tiger plague. Not only are the four rural villages alarmed, but even the county seat may be attacked at any time. Villagers who go up the mountain to cut trees have become innocent souls under the tiger's paws. The tigers can cross mountains and ridges, moving from here to there, and tiger tracks can be found in all the villages, leading to frequent bad news, and the whole county is in panic all day long. Therefore, a large sum of money was offered to recruit a tiger-fighting hero from Rong. Mr. Yang bravely responded to the recruitment, carrying a hunting gun and a dog, and a hunting lamp, which can be described as</p>
<h3>Single-Handed and with a Dog</h3>
<p>delving deep into the tiger's lair. Mr. Yang arrived in the county on June 19th and was led by a county man to Yuankeng Township, the central area of the tiger plague. The next morning, he set off to look for tigers. He found traces of tigers eating people in the deep mountains and forests, with a fishy smell that was overwhelming. After careful inspection, there were scattered human bones and remaining muscles and intestines scattered among the grass, the state was extremely tragic. Relying on the dog's sense of smell and alertness, he scouted the tracks of the evil beast along the mountain, but without results. After that, he went deep into the high mountains and ridges every day, crawling forward among the rugged rocks and thorny bushes. The thrilling scenes are no less than the scenes in "Tarzan." In order to urgently eliminate the scourge, he often waited until dawn. For fifty days, because of the</p>
<h3>Constant Exposure to the Elements</h3>
<p>he was rained on day and night, and suffered from the attacks of wild mosquitoes at night, lacking sleep and having difficulty eating. Mr. Yang suffered from malaria, but he still struggled to persevere, hoping to meet the tiger day and night, as if he had put his own life and death out of his mind. Until August 8th, on a hot day, Mr. Yang was feeling weak and tired due to the recent recovery from malaria, and was feeling depressed and annoyed when he suddenly received a notice from the Zhengfang Township Office near Yuankeng Township, saying that a woodcutter had been devoured on Daming Mountain in that township, urging him to go immediately. Mr. Yang was overjoyed and immediately took his gun and dog, and led by eight woodcutters, set off towards the destination. The mountains were steep and dangerous along the way, and the forest was deep and lush. The woodcutters dared not go with him. Mr. Yang pressed his gun and urged the dog to move forward quickly. Before he had gone a hundred meters, he found bright red bloodstains on the ground, and immediately</p>
<h3>Followed the Bloodstains</h3>
<p>for no more than sixty meters, and indeed found a corpse mixed with limbs under a fir tree. The skin and flesh from the legs to the knees and from the neck to the head had all been eaten away, and the clothes were torn to pieces. The eyes of the dead still revealed a look of extreme shock. Wild flies were greedily sucking the fishy blood. Against the backdrop of this deep forest and dim light, it was an indescribable scene of terror in the world. At this time, Mr. Yang thought that the tiger must not have gone far, so he ordered his dog to return to Yuankeng Township quickly. He immediately climbed to the top of a tree, held his breath and waited quietly. Before long, the setting sun was sinking in the west, but he still did not see any trace of the evil beast. At this time, Mr. Yang's stomach</p>
<h3>Growled on the High Ridge</h3>
<p>and he took out the dry food he had brought to fill his stomach. As soon as he finished eating, he suddenly heard the sound of a</p>
<h3>Roaring Tiger on the High Ridge.</h3>
<p>The sound was sharp and loud, like a horse neighing, and the valleys trembled. Mr. Yang quickly gripped his gun, ready to fire. In a moment, this fierce tiger, whose sins against humanity were obvious, came staggering through the gaps in the trees. There was a loud bang, and a bullet left the muzzle and went straight into the tiger's chest. He fired two more shots, and the tiger finally lay stiff in a pool of blood, its evil life ended. Mr. Yang then fired a shot into the air to signal for help. Unfortunately, none of the villagers nearby understood the hunter's signal, so he had to hurry down the mountain and call six villagers to come and carry the tiger. As soon as this news came out, it spread throughout the county, and the people were encouraged.</p>
<h3>The Families of the Deceased</h3>
<p>were greatly relieved that their great revenge had been avenged. The next day, the tiger's corpse was carried to the county seat, and civil servants and the public from all agencies rushed to see it. The local Shangyang newspaper issued an extra, and the heads of the various agencies raised their glasses in celebration, and the public performed plays to celebrate. The enthusiasm was unprecedented in a century. In order to commemorate Mr. Yang's great achievements, people in the county cast gold medals, planned to build a monument, and reported his deeds in the county chronicles.

<h3>More than Three Thousand Teachers and Students of Fudan University Pay Their Respects to the Remains of Li Denghui; Yan Huiqing and Shao Lizi Both Gave Speeches; Announcement of the Funeral Arrangements, Extremely Solemn</h3>
<p>[Report from our Office] The remains of Dr. Li Denghui, former president of Fudan University, were placed in a coffin yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Wanguo Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road, according to Christian rites. The coffin is scheduled to be buried at 3:00 PM this afternoon at the Presbyterian Cemetery on Bazibridge. Yesterday, the hall was filled with wreaths and elegiac couplets sent by people from all walks of life. The remains of the doctor were covered with the Fudan school badge made of silk with a blue background and yellow characters, and the remains were exposed. Celebrities and educators from all walks of life at home and abroad, Shao Lizi, Wang Xianhui, Yan Huiqing, Li Zhaohuan, Qian Xinzhi, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Duanmu Shi, Cheng Zhongxing, Hu Jianzhong, Ou Yuanhuai, Situ Bo, Xu Yuqing, Lin Zhuoran, and more than three thousand teachers, students, and alumni from Fudan University, the affiliated high school, and the experimental middle school, paid their respects to the remains from morning to night, extremely solemn. The current president of Fudan, Zhang Yi, the former president, Wu Suixuan, the dean of the Faculty of Arts, Wu, the director of the Journalism Department, Chen Wangdao, and others were on hand all day to greet them. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the pastors, including Xie Songgao, presided over prayers and blessings for Li. Then, Dr. Yan Huiqing reported a brief history of Li. Dr. Yan, in his capacity as someone who "knew Li early and had a deep friendship," said sadly, "I believe that a grand memorial service will be held soon, and a report will be made on the life and deeds of Mr. Tengfei. Today, I will briefly mention a few points." Li was born as an overseas Chinese. China was subjected to foreign aggression, and Li was deeply saddened. In his childhood, he made up his mind to return to the motherland and engage in education, in order to awaken his compatriots and strive for self-improvement. He then went to study in the United States. After returning to China, he discussed with Zeng (Guofan) and Li (Hongzhang) and decided to establish a university in the country, in order to train a large number of talents. Later, Li and others joined the Chinese Christian Youth Association. Li later founded the Chinese Global Student Association, in order to awaken the patriotic thoughts of young people. These two points alone show Li's determination to establish a university in China." Dr. Yan praised Li as one of the few students who have returned from studying abroad in the past few decades with the highest moral and academic achievements. Yan also said, "Among the university presidents in China, Cai Jiemin, the president of Peking University, Shang Fangji, the president of St. John's University, Stuart Leiden, the dean of Yanjing University, Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, and Li Denghui, the late president of Fudan, all dedicated their lives to education. In particular, Stuart and Bu Fangji, who devoted their lives to education in our country, are all worthy of our respect and remembrance." Yan concluded, "Some people say that Li was introduced to Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the founder of Fudan, by me to be the president of Fudan. If so, I am deeply grateful to Fudan for having such a 'good president', and I am honored." Then, Shao Lizi, the representative of the Nanjing Fudan Alumni Association, who came to Shanghai from Beijing the night before, delivered a speech. Shao was deeply saddened by the sudden death of his teacher, Li. He expanded on a few words, saying, "My life has benefited greatly from Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Cai Jiemin, and Li Denghui. Mr. Xiangbo was a Catholic, Mr. Denghui was a Christian, and the two came from the same source, while Mr. Min deeply believed in aesthetics. All three shared the same goal of loving the country and the people. The purpose of educators is to serve the country and the people, but because of different understandings, they may not fully meet the spirit of the times and the current needs. However, the leadership of the three of us is extremely correct. Li first advocated reform, and during the 'September 18th' incident, he advocated unity. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, even while ill, he was still concerned about national affairs. This kind of enthusiasm for the country and the people should be a model for us, no matter what profession we are in." After the speech, the condolences from all sides were read out, and finally the Li family expressed their thanks until the order was given to place the remains in the coffin at five o'clock.</p>
<p>Also: Mr. Shao Lizi was busy with public affairs and could not attend the funeral. He took a military plane back to Beijing last night.</p>

<h3>In Thorough Coordination with National Policy to Control Finance, Four-Bank Branch to be Reorganized Soon, Combining Nine Units to Form a National Bank with Concurrent Chairman</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the national financial center. After the victory, market disturbances have occurred repeatedly. Although the government has tried to stop it, it has not been able to do so due to various relationships, such as interest rates that are overdue. Recently, the Four-Bank Joint Office, in order to thoroughly coordinate with national policy and control Shanghai's finance, has decided to reorganize the Shanghai branch, expand its internal structure, and strengthen its scope of authority. The office was originally composed of representatives from the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, One Treasury, and the Four-Bank Joint Office, with one representative from each institution serving as a committee member. The representative from the Bank of China served concurrently as the chairman, and the representative from the Four-Bank Joint Office served concurrently as the vice-chairman. After this reorganization, the Ministry of Finance will also participate as a representative, for a total of nine units and nine committee members. The position of chairman will be changed to be held concurrently by a representative from the Central Bank, while the vice-chairman will still be responsible to the representative from the Four-Bank Joint Office. Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, the president of the National Bank, will be responsible for command and supervision in his capacity as a director. Internally, there are three groups handling affairs. The first group is in charge of party affairs, the second group is in charge of lending, and the third group is in charge of investigation and inspection. These three groups are roughly the original business, but they will be particularly strengthened after the reorganization. The third group is a new function, and all deposits, remittances, mortgages, re-mortgages, re-discounts, and various loans will be carefully examined to comply with financial controls. The organization and measures are being actively drafted by the Four-Bank Joint Office and will be implemented in the near future.</p>
<h3>An Outcry to Buy: China Stocks are All Red</h3>
<p>Except for Lianhua and Xinyi, all China stocks were up yesterday. Yongsha and Xinhe both opened below price. After the National Economic Council passed the reduction of margin requirements, the cold stocks that had been dormant for a long time emerged, and the gains even exceeded those of the hot stocks.</p>
<p>The rise was caused by reports that the National Economic Council had passed the reduction of margin requirements. Yongsha started from 375 yuan and then 388 yuan. After No. 36 and others entered to 379 yuan and 390 yuan, No. 32 and others sold, and No. 213 immediately delivered. Some Guang merchants sold outside the market, forcing the price down to 372 yuan for immediate delivery and 383 yuan for deferred delivery. No. 130 and others bought enthusiastically. Domestic goods such as Zhongfang, Xinhe, Wuhe, Yonggong, Jinglun all hit their limit up. Meiya's spot and deferred stocks were eagerly absorbed by the public and also hit their limit up. Yongsha rose to 393 yuan for immediate delivery and 402 yuan for deferred delivery. No. 26 and others sold, and No. 136 immediately delivered. Outside the market, the interest rate opened at 1.95 fen and 2.4 fen, once falling back to 2.83 yuan and 2.93 yuan. No. 4 and others re-entered and rose to over 400 yuan. Zhongxing Shipping also hit its limit up. No. 105 and others sold, still struggling, but under the vigorous entry of No. 152 and others, the buying sentiment remained strong. Qinxin and Xinguang deferred Jingfu also hit their limit up. At the close, Yongsha rose to a high of 393 yuan for immediate delivery and 408 yuan for deferred delivery, and then closed at 390 yuan and 404 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price of spot stocks, Xinyi rose slightly, Yongsha rose by half, Huaxin, Zhabei, Datong, Zhongsihua, and Huafeng matches rose by 10%, Jingfu, Zhongfa, Xinhua, Yonggong, Jinglun, Tongyi, and Rongfeng rose by 15%, and Meiya, Zhongfang, Xinguang, National Goods, Wuhe, Zhongni, Qinxing, and domestic clothing hit their limit up. Deferred stocks Yongsha rose by half, Xinguang rose by 20%, Huafeng rose by half, and Meiya had a good 10%, all hitting their limit up.</p>
<p>Market Outlook</p>
<p>Due to the weekend effect, the buying sentiment was even stronger. Except for No. 105 and others slightly selling high at the beginning of the session, the price fell back to 405 yuan and 410 yuan. No. 54 and others entered, rising to the limit of 414 yuan for immediate delivery and 422 yuan for deferred delivery. No. 76 and others sold high, No. 89 and others sold immediate delivery. The National Bank's exchange rate improved, and the price fell back to 408 yuan and 416 yuan. At this time, there was a buying frenzy throughout the market. Meiya, Jingfu, Yonggong, Xinhe, domestic clothing, Xinguang, Dongxing, Zhongfang, China, National Goods, Zhongni, enamel, Zhongsi, matches, Rongfeng, Zhabei, Datong, Wuhe, Tongyi, Xinya, Huaxin, Zhongxing, Xinhua rose in succession. The black market outside the circle was also expensive, and the buying sentiment was easily stirred up. No. 169 and others scrambled to buy. After 3:00 PM, Yongsha for immediate delivery was first at No. 190, hitting the limit up, and then Yongsha for deferred delivery also announced limit up. Near the close, both spot and deferred were traded at a discount of 23 yuan. As a result, except for Xinyi and Lianhua, all spot and deferred stocks hit their limit up. Old stocks, cultural stocks, and bank stocks outside the exchange jumped another 10%, and the remaining stocks had few sellers.</p>
<h3>United Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Increase</h3>
<p>Government bonds rose yesterday, with Room 503 selling and Room 500 et al. buying, and the transaction volume increased to 10 million. United Bond C opened at 23,100 yuan, rising from a low of 21,200 yuan to a high of 25,500 yuan. Finally, it hovered around 24,600 yuan, which was 2,000 yuan higher than the previous closing for A and B, 2,100 yuan higher for C, 1,300 yuan higher for D, and 1,500 yuan higher for E.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were slightly weak at first due to the return of securities brokers to their old nest. The black market abroad rose again, and the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate narrowed to 4 yuan. Securities brokers and money changers sold, while foreign firms and Guang merchants bought. Yisha opened at 310,000 yuan, rising from a low of 298,000 yuan to a high of 345,000 yuan at the close. As a result, the popular stocks generally rose by 10% to 15% compared to the previous closing, and there was a buying frenzy for the cold stocks and rubber stocks.</p>
<h3>Gold Smuggling: Macau as Distribution Center</h3>
<p>According to Macau sources, gold merchants who buy gold in Manila at public prices and seek good prices have made Macau an important station. They consider the Far East market to be the most promising market for gold brought to the Far East market. On average, two planes transport gold to Macau twice a week. Gold is routed through Hong Kong to Macau. This is because the Hong Kong government, at the request of the International Monetary Fund, banned gold imports in July of this year. These merchants said that the final destination of this gold is China, and it is smuggled into the country by smugglers.</p>
<h3>Small Fluctuations in Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving in the north and south markets was more than 19,170 shi. The market first rose and then fell, advancing quickly and then retreating quickly. As a result, there was little fluctuation in both japonica and indica rice. White shade yuan also had little movement. The market for flour and miscellaneous brands of flour was stable due to continuous arrivals, and Wuxi fell slightly, subsequently decreasing by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybeans fell by 30,000 yuan because both oil cake and bean cake fell, and the factory's acceptance became slack. The same was true for merchant gangs, which were rare. Community beans fell sharply by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of green beans were both low. Holders were firm, raising the price by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Red beans were not traded much, and rose slightly by 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas were priced flat, broad beans were separately priced, up 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sorghum northern gangs stopped operating, and the price fell sharply by more than 20,000 yuan. Corn continued to move in the north, remaining strong. Sesame seeds were being acquired by Tianjin, and inquiries were being made in the Nanyang region. The market was active, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were strongly re-absorbed by the Guang gangs, soaring by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Bean cake was low by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In a market with a chorus of selling, all oils fell sharply. Raw oil fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil, sesame oil, and light oil fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Soybean oil fell sharply by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Domestic Tea Outlook Good</h3>
<p>The domestic sales of tea are strong, and the situation has not cooled down. The future is unanimously optimistic. As for export patterns, supply has been dwindling in recent days, and yesterday the market was again disturbed by the rumors of the opening of the African Chinese tea market, so the intention of holders to defend the price became even more strong. Exporters tried to buy at a low price, but it was even more of a pipe dream, so trading declined again.</p>
<h3>Excess Liquidity, Loose Credit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] With excess liquidity and soaring prices, the authorities are working hard to tighten credit and stabilize the price increase, but credit remains loose. Yesterday, the difference between the Four Banks and Two Bureaus was 41.8 billion, the difference at the National Bank was 70.7 billion, the difference at the Big Exchange was 59.4 billion, the difference at the foreign bank was 41.8 billion, and the difference at the Small Exchange was 24.2 billion. The difference at the Bank of China was 5.1 billion, the difference at the Transportation Bank was 28.3 billion, the difference at the Agricultural Bank was 5.0 billion, the difference at the China Trust Bureau was 15.4 billion, the difference at the Postal Remittance Bureau was 2.1 billion, and the difference at the Cooperative Treasury was 3.5 billion.</p>
<h3>Quarterly Quota Has Been Approved, President Zhang to Return to Shanghai to Announce</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to reliable sources: Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Import and Export Control Commission, will return to Shanghai today or tomorrow after attending the National Economic Council meeting, carrying the quarterly quota numbers approved by the National Economic Council for announcement. It is also learned that the quarterly quota is US$53,393,000, and the US$20 million for cotton is not included. The total amount of the previous quarter's quota was US$67,873,000, which seems to be more than the fourth quarter. However, it included US$20 million for cotton, and the fourth quarter's quota is separate from the cotton funds, so it is actually an increase of US$5,520,000 compared to the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaders of the city's industrial circles met with reporters and expressed their views on the fourth quarter's quota, saying that the government has repeatedly reduced the import quota due to the meager foreign exchange reserves. However, judging from the situation in the third quarter, the distance between the import of raw materials and the needs of industry is still far away. Now that the government has once again reduced the fourth quarter's import quota, the distance is even more remote. However, the government also has its own difficulties.</p>
<h3>Banks and Firms Charge Too Much Handling Fee for Discount Loans</h3>
<p>According to the Secretariat of the Central Bank, since the implementation of discount loans, it has been discovered that the banks and firms acting as guarantors charge too much in handling fees. In theory, industrial and commercial enterprises apply to commercial banks for mortgage loans, and the commercial banks then re-mortgage the collateral to the National Bank. The National Bank provides 70% or 80% of the loan, and the commercial banks then add another 20%, so that industrial and commercial enterprises can use the full 100%. However, today's commercial banks, in order to control deposits in large quantities, not only have no funds to lend themselves, but also stipulate that some of the funds borrowed from commercial banks for re-mortgaging must be deposited in the bank. In reality, industrial and commercial enterprises obtain very little. In today's inflationary environment, it is hoped that commercial banks will think more about the country's industrial and commercial enterprises and try to guide floating capital into production channels as much as possible. Situations like this really need to be improved.</p>
<h3>It is Estimated That the Floating Capital Escaping to Hong Kong Reaches 200 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Regarding the amount of floating capital fleeing to Hong Kong, financial circles estimate that it has reached 200 million Hong Kong dollars. These wealthy people are mostly from the Central and North China regions. The deposits in Hong Kong banks have reached more than 70 million Hong Kong dollars, but in reality the number is higher. Because the methods of escaping floating capital to Hong Kong are very clever, it is very difficult to get an official statistic. Some of the escaped capital accumulated in Hong Kong is used to purchase goods, preparing to transport them to the mainland at the appropriate time to seek profits. This type of investment accounts for a large proportion, about tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars. Others who speculate in land or set up factories to manufacture products are also numerous, but they account for a very small number. As for financial speculation, it is also one of the outlets for floating capital.</p>
<h3>The Negotiation Price is Increased Again, the Price of Yarn Rises Madly, 20-Count Yarn Surpasses the 30 Million Mark</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The negotiated price of cotton yarn has risen sharply again. The negotiation team of the Textile Adjustment Conference yesterday decided to increase the price of 20-count standard yarn to 35.5 million yuan, an increase of 2.4 million yuan compared to the previous price. The prices of other grades of yarn have also increased proportionally. In addition to the usual allocation of Grade A yarn, the conference has also resumed the allocation of Grade B (yarn count) yarn, which had been suspended for a long time. The total amount of cotton yarn sold yesterday was extremely large.</p>
<p>Another report: The yarn and cloth market was extremely chaotic yesterday, with prices rising madly. The market was filled with calls for price increases. The price of 20-count standard yarn has already surpassed the 30 million yuan mark, exceeding the new negotiated price by more than 5 million yuan. The price of Longtou fine cloth has also exceeded the 1.3 million yuan mark. The authorities are paying close attention to this situation. Economic police are stationed throughout the market, closely monitoring it, and will intensify their investigation today.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, 42-count blue Phoenix fine yarn ended at a high price of 47.5 million yuan, continuing to rise by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn also rose by 570,000 yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn generally increased rather than decreased.</p>
<p>Fine Cloth Rises Rapidly: The cotton cloth market opened in the morning due to the unified allocation of textiles by the Textile Construction Company the day before. Each household was allocated 40 pieces of Longtou fine cloth. There were ample chips on the market, and sellers were lax, resulting in clear transactions and a temporary weakening of the market. However, powerful buyers outside the market saw that prices were low and actively bought up the cloth. Furthermore, as the price of Textile Construction yarn increased, the cloth market followed suit. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose sharply by 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day, with each piece costing 1.32 million yuan. The prices of other grades of fine cloth also increased by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths also increased by varying amounts, ranging from 10,000 to 45,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Continues to Rise: Yesterday's spot cotton market remained firm, with high market sentiment. Yarn factories frequently purchased cotton, and retail buyers actively bought up cotton. Market prices soared again, with demand exceeding supply. Prices rose by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions amounted to 1,800 bales, or 250 dan. Prices for factory delivery were: Lingbao, 5.373 million to 5.58 million yuan; Han fine cotton, 4.795 million to 4.836 million yuan; Shashi, 4.96 million yuan; Dezi cotton, 5.54 million yuan; and improved American cotton, 5.54 million yuan. Transactions amounted to 930 bales, or 250 dan. Prices for wharf delivery were: Han fine cotton, 4.67 million to 4.877 million yuan; Chongsha, 4.96 million yuan; Jingyang new goods, 5.46 million yuan; and Huoji, 3.265 million yuan. Transactions amounted to 870 bales. Bureau Pu seed cotton, 800,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Importers and Exporters Oppose Export Visa Measures</h3>
<p>The Non-Quota Allocation Office of the Export and Import Management Committee recently planned to implement export visa measures. Importers and exporters in this city strongly oppose this plan. Their reasons are as follows: The prices of various domestic products for export are kept secret by all merchants. Therefore, the implementation of export visas will inevitably reveal all export secrets. Currently, some goods that cannot be exported can be sold on the black market by concealing a small amount of foreign exchange to make up for losses. Therefore, there are still some sporadic goods that can be exported. If export visas are implemented, foreign exchange cannot be concealed. It is estimated that exports may decrease by 40%. The situation of export stagnation will become even more severe. Implementing export visas is a disguised preliminary implementation of export controls. Adding controls to exports while encouraging exports will not only fail to achieve good results but will also stimulate domestic exporters to become exhausted. Looking at the current situation, the implementation of export visas must be postponed.</p>

<h3>The News That Coal Prices Will Rise Again Is Incorrect</h3>
<p>It is learned that manufacturers in Beijing and Shanghai, in order to ensure the supply of coal for the winter, have been stepping up purchases and transportation from non-controlled areas. More than 20,000 tons of bituminous coal from Zaozhuang have already been transported to Beijing and Shanghai via the Jinzhuang Railway. The Railway Bureau is currently dispatching more vehicles to assist. The previous rumor that coal prices would rise again is now incorrect because of the abundant supply. The Fuel Management Committee has decided to maintain the original price to stabilize public sentiment.</p>
<h3>The Decision to Establish a Preparatory Office for Participation in the Milan Exhibition</h3>
<p>Italy has invited our country to participate in the Milan International Exhibition to be held on April 13th next year. After our envoy to Italy, Mr. Xue Guangqian, returned to the country and contacted government officials and industrial and commercial leaders, it was generally agreed that this is the first international exhibition held in Europe after the war. It is a good opportunity for our manufacturers to promote their goods and compete for the European market, and we should participate. Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened the China National Import and Export Trade Association, the Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association, and the China National Goods United Company to initially exchange opinions and decided to establish a preparatory committee. Concrete measures will be discussed separately at a later date with government agencies, industrial and commercial organizations, financial institutions, and enthusiastic manufacturers. Those in the industrial and commercial sectors who are interested in this matter can contact the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for details.</p>
<h3>China Trust Purchases All Autumn Silk for Export</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] China Trust has purchased more than 6,500 dan of autumn silk this year, which is far from the original plan of 14,600 dan. All of the purchased autumn silk will be used for export. Among them, 3,000 dan have been transported to India, Burma, and other places, and the remaining quantity is also being transported successively.</p>
<h3>Upstream for Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The standard market for woolen fabrics is tending upward due to the lively sales caused by the cold weather. Melton overcoating, uniform fabric, long-haired camel cashmere, cavalry twill, fancy suiting, medium-thick serge, and thick plain fabric are all selling well, with obvious and hidden increases in prices. Lining materials such as French serge, black charcoal serge, mercerized feather yarn, sleeve twill, yarn-backed flower cloth, etc., are also selling well. Wholesale and retail prices have all increased due to the cost of raw materials and finishing. Mercerized feather yarn is the most popular, with the top grade priced at 75,000 yuan per yard, the second grade at 67,000 to 68,000 yuan, and the third grade at 60,000 yuan. Yarn-backed flower cloth is priced at 85,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, sleeve twill is priced at 75,000 yuan to 90,000 yuan, and flower cloth is around 50,000 yuan. French serge is priced at 25,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan, and black charcoal serge is priced at 40,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Lingers in a Weak State, Market Price Drops by One Million Yuan Compared to the Previous Day</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon silk fabrics is still being applied for. Therefore, despite the stimulus of soaring prices of other commodities, rayon remains weak. 1200-count 1A Asahi bright rayon once fell to 99 million yuan in the morning and then rose to between 103 and 3 million yuan. It then fell again in the afternoon, with transactions at 1 million yuan. Finally, it recovered slightly, with a selling price of 2 million yuan, which was 1 million yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Filature Silk</p>
<p>The market was stable yesterday. Because the market price has increased, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions are extremely rare. The asking prices for five-phase individual lot goods remained unchanged, and transactions for high-grade individual lots were slightly active, with the price still at 7 million to 8 million yuan. The market for Qianjing silk was bullish yesterday, with special top-grade individual ancestors reaching about 60 million yuan, and ordinary individual ancestors also asking for 55 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Except for quilt covers and checkered crepe, which were traded speculatively and soaring in price, other goods in the market rose very little yesterday due to weak actual sales. Dacheng and Huaqiang genuine silk quilt covers opened at 8.9 million yuan, with more buyers than sellers, and prices rose steadily. Some people sold at high prices, causing a slight correction.

<p>The market for cigarettes in this city has been fluctuating again recently. It is reported that the Goods Tax Bureau will adjust the fourth phase of the first cigarette tax amount starting next week.

Any amount exceeding one-fourth of the market price will be taxed according to grade. It is reported that the minimum increase this time is 25%, such as (Four O'Clock Brand), and the maximum increase is 400%, (such as Big Red Luck) brand. Those with an increase of 50% are less, (such as Kletensky), and those with an increase of about 100% are more, such as Big Cannon Tower, White Gate, and Big Bank. The average adjusted new tax amount is about 100.6% higher (October was 83%).</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Dullness of the Art World</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>The dull atmosphere of the art world after the war, the decline and desolation of the literary world, most people are unwilling to think too much about it because it is not their business. They seem to only offer a lazy reason: high prices and difficult living conditions. For those engaged in literary and artistic work, it is not that simple. They seem to have a belly full of frustration, eager to vent; but struggling to do so.</p>
<p>If we are unwilling to let this dull situation drag on forever; that is to say, we must dispel the sorrow shrouding the hearts of artists, so that they can restore the excited and enthusiastic emotions of wartime and strive to write for the construction of a prosperous, strong, and happy new China, and even the reconstruction of a new world, then we should calmly and thoroughly examine the causes of the dullness of the art world.</p>
<p>The war-torn and dilapidated world is like a broken ship that has weathered a great storm, with a ship full of lives waiting to be saved. At this time, it is still thrown into the stormy waves, helplessly watching another great storm brewing under a dull low pressure. If it unfortunately erupts, it will only be destroyed together. The shadow of despair has submerged the sun of hope, and the foolishness, selfishness, and ambition of a few... are stepping up the reproduction of a tragic catastrophe for mankind, and asking them to return to clear reason will waste thousands of lives and countless living resources. This is already foreseen in the imagination of artists, and they can use skillful techniques to depict this tragic picture without exaggeration, but everyone has not done so. Although the Second World War reduced the total proportion of the entire population, the ambition of mankind will not die. When someone is trying to develop their own ambition at this moment, and the pitiful human beings are confused by the novel and moving slogans issued by the ambitious, it seems that they are willing to regard death as home. This is the great tragedy of human nature—a catastrophe caused by human beings willing to exploit their weaknesses! A very small number of artists only have a low voice of self-pity, self-shame, and self-knowledge that cannot wake up the dream of mankind, and become even more silent!</p>
<p>In all fairness, artists should never remain silent at this juncture when the fate of all mankind is about to be decided in an instant! We should not think that actively unfolding today's literary and artistic work cannot save mankind's doom. We should first lose heart and put down our weapons and fall into the abyss of sorrow. The most important factor in winning victory in the Second World War was the atomic bomb invented by scientists, and striving for the peace of victory, and the construction of peace, should be the joint efforts of educators, thinkers, and scientists, especially artists who grasp the theme of "seeking survival and loving peace" of all mankind, and try to shout and strive to write great works. If we can observe coldly and quietly, and constantly expose the traps of the ambitious and uncover the smoke screen they spread, in order to be able to stand firm and stand firm, they can seize the blind obedience of "Chi Chi Zhe Min" under a certain name, and only constantly change the nice slogans; but it is always in vain and extremely difficult to achieve their wishes. This can delay the arrival of the great storm in both tangible and intangible ways, and at least can effectively resist for a while at the moment of the great storm's invasion, allowing them to have a gap for reflection. After weighing the pros and cons and thoroughly reviewing the gains and losses, maybe they can reduce their ambition immediately and stop in time? Because the one-time turn of those ambitious people—whether it is a right turn or a smooth turn—is the thermometer that determines the fate of mankind, and as of today, the vast people do not seem to have much power to determine the temperature of the thermometer's rise and fall. To be honest, the work of artists is always an important factor. In this way, when the ship of peace has dropped anchor and run aground halfway today, how can our art workers not wake up and remain silent for a long time! Everything in reality is not enough to satisfy the artists who are thirsting for this. But there is no need to be pessimistic or disappointed. It is enough to prove that our work needs to be intensified, which is indeed a certain fact. Based on this meaning, instead of being dissatisfied with reality together with us, it is better to be dissatisfied with ourselves first, then conduct an objective self-examination, find the correct direction, and move forward bravely. That is to resolutely and clearly accept the requirements of all mankind to "seek survival and love peace," work hard to promote their own work, and strive to promote the journey of peace, and strive to send the ship full of lives waiting to be saved to the peaceful and happy shore!</p>
<h3>Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Scholars who write poetry often follow stereotypes, while those who do not know books often come up with their own ideas. Liu Bang's "Song of the Great Wind," Xiang Yu's "Song of Gaixia," and Hulu Jin's "Song of Chichin" can all express the subtlety of nature. Emperor Wu of Han's "Song of the Autumn Wind" and Han Yu's "Qin Cao," although the lyrics are more elaborate, are all involved in imitation and are not as expressive of temperament as the first three.</p>
<p>Wang Ji's poem: "Seeing people all drunk, how can I bear to be sober alone!" This comes from Chu Ci. Qu Yuan said: "Everyone is drunk, but I am sober alone." Ruan Zhuo's poem: "Forgetting each other is naturally happy, how can Zhuang and Hui know?" This comes from Nanhua Jing. "Huizi said: You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of fish? Said: You are not me, how do you know that I do not know the joy of fish?" Wang and Ruan's two poems are good at overturning the case. Zimei said: "Next year, who will be healthy at this meeting, drunk, I will carefully look at the dogwood." Liu Jun's poem: "No need to look at the dogwood carefully, I will take it next year to be strong." The ancient poem says: "The Hu horse relies on the north wind, and the Yue bird nests on the south branch." Fan Yun's poem: "Yue Island hates the north tree, and the Hu horse fears the wind." Although this overturns the case, it seems clumsy and tasteless.</p>
<p>The rhythm should be in thousands of branches, and the nobility lies in the virtual use. For example, Wen Tingyun's poem: "The wind rolls the roots of the artemisia, and it stores itself in the E and Ji, and the moon moves the shadows of the pine trees to guard the Geng and Shen;" Xie Zhen's poem: "Half-mountain meals extend the Jiazi, and the lonely lamp illuminates the night to guard the Gengshen," are extremely stable. If Xu Hun's poem: "Every year is long and laborious to push the Jiazi, and the cold night first shares the Gengshen," then the actual pair is in thousands of branches, and it is particularly lacking in thickness. According to the "Ai Ri Zhai Cong Chao," Xu Mao's poem: "The year of abundance of Jiazi, the spring is without rain, and the good night of Gengyou, the summer is enough to sleep;" Jiannan's poem: "Everywhere is happy to see a clear spring Jiazi, and every family builds a room to cross Gengshen; there is a fear of heavy rain in the spring Jiazi, and the dim light is ashamed to guard the night Gengshen." "Tiaoxi Yuyin" said: "Meet Jiazi on a rainy day and sit at night to guard Gengshen." All use the millennium tree to enter the pair.</p>
<p>"Turtle" is not avoided in poetry. Su Jiaohe's "Peach Blossom Spring Poem": "The heavy turtle is also the most sucking, and the Qi dog also barks at night;" Bao Shu's "Autumn Garden Forest Poem": "The bird pecked at the new gap in the chestnut, and the turtle half lay on the building," are all in the upper class. And Dongpo also likes to use it as a rhyme, such as "There are swimming turtles in the depths of the green lotus," "Shrinking its neck to sleep at night like a frozen turtle," "Wanting to fight the snakes and turtles with its teeth and hair," and "The fathers all carry turtles" and so on. Yu Xin's poem on lotus flowers: "If there is a thousand-year-old Cai, I must nest but see it with me," Liang Jianwen's poem on cooling: "Swimming fish blow water foam, and the gods in the heart of the lotus;" Yuan Zhen's poem on fragrant trees: "Clear pond raises the god turtle." Although Cai is a big turtle, it is not as clear and refreshing as the turtle character to enter poetry with the Cai character.</p>
<p>"People's smoke is quiet across the water, and the ghost fire shines on the sand plug," This is the poem of the Four Ming Mountain people remembering Yanmen. It is rare to say that the fire is cold in poetry. Yu Xin's poem: "The silkworm has no machine weaving, and the flowing fire brings coldness;" Wu Ji's poem: "Vast Zhu Tian is ripe, and the green fire is cold," the following sentence is strange, but it is a pity that the poem is not as good as the Four Ming Mountain people's poem, which seems to be more industrial than Wu.</p>
<h3>Frost Maple</h3>
<p>— Ji Ke</p>
<p>You took off your green coat, child, you reddened your cheeks, beautiful girl sleeping in the autumn forest, you really make me intoxicated, how can I tell you my mood!</p>
<p>Do you still remember your mother, she gave you jewels all over your ears, white semicircular jewels, in the warm season, she prepared this dowry for you. Dao still remembers, at that time, I often sat beside you, talking about a lovely chapter of poetry; your green coat sheltered me from the strong light of the sun, and when I often raised my head to steal a look at your beauty, you would also look at me once to make me shy. Occasionally on holidays, you would also be willing to tell me ancient myths, and I would want to never leave you and listen to your voice.</p>
<p>But, on a night when I was quietly gazing at you in the cold moon, I couldn't hear those excellent musicians singing for your joy. The night hawk was wailing, he told me that you were suffering from an acute illness, but there was no doctor's hand that could know your symptoms. Your moans can no longer make me cross the stream that night. The cold wind teased you, and the cunning laughter made my jealous heart unbearable. I want to wear a moonlight to see you, and use my steel arms to block their way. But my heart is full of sorrow and desolation.</p>
<p>You are like a dying virgin, destined to endure gently, without a word of complaint, not angry, with a smile on your pale lips. Don't you see the deep tomb, the purple-red brilliance on your posture flashes, today you live here, but tomorrow you will no longer exist. Sweet and tragic days; enchanting eyes dreaming; talking about your eternal beauty and my kindness. I love you, but the extravagant decay of your life makes me sad.</p>
<p>When the east calls me to the fiery light of a clear day, I pick up your remaining red with a heart full of sorrow. The west wind picks you up from the ground, but drops you weakly. You really look like you carry too much sorrow. I snatched you from their arms and put you in my beloved chapter of poetry</p>
<h3>Insomnia Concert</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>Bo Bo Bo! Du Du Du! Bo!…</p>
<p>The newly born eight-cylinder Buick is really naughty, always yelling and shouting randomly. On the road at night, it still goes over time with a wave and shouts in the past with a burst. The night shift patrolman who was ordered to prohibit it from barking could only: "Humph!" Give a cold laugh to tease, and send it away. …Bo Bo Bo! Du!…</p>
<p>The dry cough of a lung patient, wantonly, recklessly, violently rushes out of the suffocating chest and the dry mouth, sweeps across the dimly lit, deserted street center, jumps to your window, and knocks heavily on the glass.</p>
<p>In the pure sky before dawn in early winter, a clear and good throat, a voice:</p>
<p>"White sugar rice cake!… Heavy sugar rice cake!…"</p>
<p>A string of crystal balls is poured from this street to that street.</p>
<p>The rice cake packed in such a sonorous tenor has been enough to make people drool three feet, let alone it is a heavy sugar, white sugar, sweet!</p>
<h3>Words from the Forest</h3>
<p>— Kai Gong</p>
<p>"Words from the Forest" was compiled by Fei Qi, a hermit from Hezhong Hedong in Jin Dynasty, which is worthy of mentioning in the words and answers of the scholars since the Han and Wei Dynasties. However, because the record of Xie An's words was untrue, it was criticized by An, and the book was dismissed. "Shi Shuo Xin Yu" briefly mentioned this matter in the derogatory article. Its writing style is also slightly similar to "Shi Shuo". "Taiping Yulan" 389 recorded a relic of it, saying that "Wang Ziyou once temporarily lived in an empty house of someone else and ordered them to plant bamboo. Or asked why bother to live temporarily? Yong pointed to the bamboo and said: "How can I live without this gentleman for a day?"" Later generations called "You can't live without bamboo," which came out of this. There will only understand you, so that your sorrow will be transformed into a new force. Farmers collect your legacy on your sick body, and white fruits fall with bursts of laughter and the sound of hooks. They are happy, they thank you for your kindness; they thank you for sacrificing for them. However, they have never sung for your beauty! Only I, this infatuated child, am still looking forward to your glory.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"What's your opinion?" After hearing Little Tiger's report, I wanted to sound out Yaoqun's opinion.</p>
<p>"To get a car, I really need to say something." Yaoqun at this time wrinkled her brow, head bowed in contemplation, as if she had stirred up a bellyful of thoughts.</p>
<p>"It's not about getting a car," I added, "I can still manage to get a few cars... I'm asking you, how should we arrange things here; who goes and who doesn't? What about the people imprisoned by the dwarfs? We certainly can't abandon them... Also, regarding buying supplies, we need to have a response, right?"</p>
<p>"All of this is easy to handle, if I speak, it can also be put aside for the moment; this matter of buying supplies, you also don't need to bother thinking about... it's just that I'm thinking..." Yaoqun said to this point, suddenly stopped. Her complexion gradually paled, as if she suddenly felt a great pain in her spirit or body.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking?" I heard her words have a meaning, couldn't help but panic, a little uncertain about Yaoqun's thoughts.</p>
<p>"Get a few comrades, leave them all to me, I still have a little way." Dingyuan, who had just woken up, suddenly interjected at this time.</p>
<p>"That's of course good, but I hope you also go to Beiping with us all the way." I responded to Dingyuan, but at this time, all my thoughts were focused on Yaoqun's strange attitude, so I asked Yaoqun again; "You definitely have to go to Tianjin, because Tsurumi suddenly mobilizing on such a large scale, the matter must be extremely important. You..."</p>
<p>"Me?" Yaoqun only got out these two words, suddenly shedding a string of large tears. I didn't know what to say, only saw Yaoqun cover her face with her hands, suddenly getting up and going to the back room.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the agreed time arrived, we were all getting ready to get into the car, everyone was present, but couldn't see Yaoqun and Little Tiger's shadows. Bearing endless trouble and danger, we waited for about a quarter of an hour, Yaoqun and Little Tiger still hadn't appeared. Although I somewhat understood in my heart why they had inexplicably disappeared, there was nothing I could do, so I could only give the order to depart. (End of Chapter Nine)</p>
<h3>Guanyin (Copy of Huang Binhong's Painting)</h3>
<p>— Li Dinglong</p>
<h3>Sour and Clever Tunes</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>I previously introduced to readers the wonderful words of Shuang Qing, in which each sentence had a "spring" character. Now I also recall that Suan Qi also has a tune in which each sentence uses a "spring" character. Although the tune is very short, the style is particularly good, so I will record it again below:</p>
<p>Suan Qi once went to a feast of relatives, and a guest asked him to compose a "Qingjiang Yin," and limited the use of the five elements "gold, wood, water, fire, earth" as the first character of each sentence, and since it was the beginning of spring, it was also necessary to use the character "spring" in each sentence. Suan Qi immediately said on the spot: "Gold and silver shadows shake spring swallows slant, wood shoots and spring leaves grow, water pond spring begins to ripple, fire heat spring is initially ripe, earth ox carries spring away." All the guests burst into laughter.</p>
<p>According to Suan Qi's personal name, he was a grandson of Ke Haiya, his father's name was Zhenzhike, so he took Shi as his surname, named himself Xiao Shishihai, and was also known as Suanhua Daoren. Ming Ning Shouwang Quan Taihe Zheng also commented that his words were like a heavenly horse breaking free from its reins, so the beauty of his words can be known. Suan Zhai was born with a divine and outstanding appearance, and his strength surpassed others. At the age of seventy-two or three, he loved Yongmen. When he made strong men ride three evil horses at full speed, he held a waiting there, and when the horse arrived, he jumped on it, crossed one and rode three, operating the wind, and the spectators were moved. When he grew up, he devoted himself to reading and exhausted them. In the reign of Renzong, he was appointed Hanlin Academician, and suddenly sighed: "A word of resignation is humble, which is what Puxian advocates," so he claimed illness and resigned to live in Jiangnan, in the Qiantang market, his name was , his clothes were changed, and no one knew him. Seeing this, Suan Tong was not only proficient in both civil and military affairs, but also a foreign person.</p>
<h3>Election Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Wei Fengjiang</p>
<p>Elections must have skills, and the most important thing is of course to brag. Either by mouth, or by pen, either self-bragging, or people bragging. The Chinese are stable, so during elections, they mainly rely on writing or people bragging, while Europeans and Americans like to take risks, so candidates mostly rely on self-bragging and speaking.</p>
<p>Adventurers are easy to succeed and easy to fail, because when you are talking enthusiastically, the lurking opponents may suddenly give you a stab, and if you can't calmly respond and strike the attacker, then your audience will disperse in your panicked expression, and from then on you will never be able to summon them again, and there will be no hope of being elected.</p>
<p>Once, an old man began his speech when running for Congress, frankly and emotionally: "Mr. Chairman, I have lived enough..." Before he finished speaking, someone in the audience shouted: "Stop, he has lived enough!" The whole audience roared with laughter, and the old man sat down silently, his body trembling with anger.</p>
<p>Another candidate used a serious and heavy tone to recount his many reform proposals:</p>
<p>"We need land reform Iandreform, we need housing reform Housereform, we need insurance reform Insurancereform, we need..." "Chloroform Luo Fang" a listener continued like this. This anesthetic really mesmerized the speaker, and he stood there like a wooden chicken.</p>
<p>A shrewd candidate will never be easily defeated. A candidate whose face had turned red due to alcoholism was just finishing a powerful speech when a listener suddenly asked loudly: "Hey, Bonar, I ask you, why has your face turned so red?" Bonar replied without慌乱: "It's because I saw your face is too thick, so I blushed."</p>
<p>"Can't hear, can't hear." A crowd always shouted like this. The candidate on the stage then pretended to be surprised and said:</p>
<p>"Could it be that with ears as long as yours, you can't hear what I'm saying?" So the whole audience turned to look at the ears of the shouter, and he stopped shouting.</p>
<p>A candidate running for mayor attacked the current city government slightly in his speech. An opponent shouted at him:</p>
<p>"It's not reliable that you say there are many unemployed people here. My sister wants to find one or two people to saw wood here, but she can't find them." The speaker quickly replied: "I don't believe what you said is true, unless I personally meet your sister."</p>
<p>Lloyd George, the former leader of the British Liberal Party, was an orator. Once, a woman interrupted his speech:</p>
<p>"George, if I were your wife, I would definitely poison you." Lloyd George replied: "Madam, if you were my wife, I would be willing to swallow your poison."</p>
<p>Once, he had a big joke with someone who was preventing him from speaking. That person asked loudly: "Mr. George, do you still remember that your grandfather was a carriage driver?" Lloyd George pondered for a while and said: "Gentlemen, please forgive me. I have forgotten the carriage, but I found that the carriage driver is still alive." He looked at the questioner as he spoke. What can you do with such a person?</p>
<p>At a women's conference, a lady asked her audience when her speech reached the most important juncture: "What is the result of our liberation?" She looked around after asking and waited for an answer. This infuriated a man standing in the corner, who had come to the meeting to wait for his wife to go home. He answered loudly: "I know." The lady on the stage said contemptuously: "Listen, that bald-headed dwarf says he can answer our question. Please tell us."</p>
<p>"Cold meals and children with tattered clothes" was the dwarf's answer.</p>
<p>Churchill's wife once canvassed for her husband. She met a worker and asked him for help. "No," the worker replied: "I don't intend to vote for someone who sleeps until noon." Mrs. Churchill said: "There is no such thing, I am his wife, you should believe me." The worker said: "Madam, you are so beautiful that I believe my words are true."</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, there was a politician in England named Macaulay, who had such an incident in Edinburgh. One night, he and his candidate stood on the same stage. Suddenly, a listener threw a dead cat at him. That person immediately got up and said that it was thrown at him by mistake. Macaulay said, "Okay, I hope you were going to throw it at me but accidentally threw it at someone else.</p>
<h3>Wartime Groom</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>Many American war brides have returned to their home countries with their husbands. One of them is different from the other brides in gender. He is a man. He married a U.S. Army nurse and became a U.S. citizen with his wife. He is a wartime bride who is different from the others – a wartime groom.</p>
<p>Lockard was a Belgian liaison officer sent to Germany. He was accidentally injured in a car accident and was lying in a U.S. Army hospital. Therefore, he met Katherine, an army nurse. After he recovered, he was dismissed from the Belgian army, so he worked as a clerical worker in the U.S. military headquarters in Nuremberg. At that time, they got engaged.</p>
<p>Marriage must be approved by the U.S. military headquarters, which is not as simple as a daughter asking her parents. Lockard then filled out five resumes and applied to the U.S. military headquarters for marriage. Two months later, the approval document came down. Their marriage did not violate the regulations of the U.S. military and could be allowed. Lockard wanted to obtain U.S. citizenship as soon as possible, so he went to the consulate to inquire again. Four months later, he received a reply saying that according to Article 271 of the U.S. law, he could obtain U.S. citizenship as a war bride.</p>
<p>Lockard took the letter from the consulate to the U.S. military headquarters to handle the necessary procedures. Difficult problems arose. There were no male war brides in the military regulations. As a result, the application was sent in the name of Katherine's spouse. Six weeks later, the U.S. military headquarters recognized Lockard as a wartime bride and attached a form to investigate his past situation. Is he pregnant now? How many months? This made the male wartime bride who was used to laughed or cried.</p>
<p>Later, Lockard received a notice asking him to register with the wartime bride group. It was a dormitory for military families, all of whom were women and children, and he was the only man, but his current status was only allowed to move in. The administrator assigned him to No. 11, but he couldn't get in when he got there. The military officer in charge of No. 11 said: There were no rooms or beds there, because only soldiers could live there. Although he was a quasi-soldier, he was now only the spouse of a soldier. He also went to No. 10, but there were all women there.</p>
<p>This special bride stumped the administrators and reluctantly slept on the bed of a lieutenant in No. 9 for one night. The next day, he gave up the lieutenant's bed to him. They ate in the restaurant, Katherine paid for her food, but Lockard didn't have to pay, because he was a wartime bride, a new guest of the government, and could eat with a wartime bride's coupon.</p>
<p>Lockard waited for a long time and finally returned home with many war brides. When he boarded the ship, he was stopped again, because he was neither a soldier nor a military family member. But the person in charge knew it and still sent him on the ship. At that time, the deck was empty, but it was occupied by naval and army personnel. According to the rules, he could go to the first-class cabin, because that was the war brides' cabin, but he was a male war bride. So a crew member's room was vacated to serve as the cabin for the male wartime bride.</p>
<p>This only wartime groom arrived in his new country among the wartime brides. Because of the difference in his gender, he suffered a lot of trouble, and there were no words to describe it. After arriving in the United States, the notices he received always had "Mrs. Lockard" written on the envelope. How did they know that he was not a bride, but a real groom.</p>
<h3>Choosing Your Ideal Man</h3>
<p>— Jieyu</p>
<p>Taipei Mayor You Mijian said: "Electing National Assembly representatives is like choosing a good husband. You must choose the one you have in mind."</p>
<p>Talented men and beautiful women are a match made in heaven. It is a lifelong regret to choose a husband without talent. But talents have internal and external distinctions. On the "face," he is "outstanding in appearance," but in private, he may be "a fancy pillow." With a "bellyful" of "exquisite strategies," he may have a "dark face." If you only "judge people by their appearance" when choosing your ideal man, you will "lose Ziyu"!</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the current "eligible bachelors" are quite skilled. Before he has truly captured your soul, his words are often as sweet as honey and his love as deep as the sea. He is very eager to please you, "not daring to go a little west when asked to go east." But don't really think that you can "rely on him for life." You must know that some people are tricking you into getting involved.</p>
<p>If electing National Assembly representatives is really like a woman choosing her ideal man, then please don't "ignore my words."</p>

<h3>Miss America's Religious Views</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>People in religious countries do not necessarily completely believe in religion. On the contrary, most people use religious rituals as a means of socializing. In the United States, it is customary to go to church from 9:00 to 10:00 am every Sunday. Residents bring their children, change into new clothes, and dress neatly. Rural people who are usually barefoot also put on old-fashioned suits, tie ties, and pretend to be civilized to go to church. In the church, you can meet many relatives, friends, and neighbors who are hard to meet. From the greetings, you can talk about business. Young men and women, especially, regard going to church as a good opportunity to make friends of the opposite sex. On the surface, they are well-behaved, but in secret, men and women are greedy for love. Young lovers who don't often meet can take advantage of the church service to make an appointment and have a good time on Sunday afternoon. Most American women, except for a few who devote themselves to missionary work, do not have a deep understanding of religion. They simply cannot understand the various categories and systems in the Old Church and the New Church. If you ask her why she goes to this church instead of another church, she cannot tell you why. There are also many people who follow others. She goes to whatever church others go to. Some women have loud voices and are initially invited to sing hymns. She simply regards singing hymns as a good opportunity to show off and inevitably performs every week.</p>
<p>In churches, many young men and women who do not know each other fall in love with each other because they sit together or run together. Lovers eventually become married, and Jesus has his reasons.</p>
<p>A Chinese officer in Denver met a local only golden-haired girl in church. In less than three months, they held a wedding. The young couple often accompanied the bride's parents to eat at the officers' club, so I also knew them. This Chinese officer didn't even have a car, but the golden-haired girl could be regarded as a fairy, and she was a rare beauty among American women.</p>
<p>The Public Speaking Institute of the University of Denver separately came up with the topic of "Sino-American Intermarriage." The doctors argued with red faces. I strongly advocated intermarriage. American men opposed intermarriage. Young American women advocated intermarriage. Old American women opposed intermarriage. To be honest, no one wants old American women at all. Let them oppose it!

<h3>Reader Consulting Legal Questions and Answers</h3>
<h3>The Suffering of Ordinary People in the Housing Shortage</h3>
<h3>Second Landlord Transfers for Profit</h3>
<h3>Big Landlord Extorts Huge Sums of Money</h3>
<p>Editor: I have several legal questions. I beg for answers. A second landlord, Mr. Tian, without the permission of the landlord, subdivided the rented house and transferred it to others. He himself then moved to another place. Can the landlord terminate the contract and take back the house? Assuming that after the contract is terminated, the three tenants currently living in the house will spend a huge amount of transfer fees and sign a transfer contract with the second landlord, is this contract valid? Or can they continue to live only by signing a contract with the landlord? The three tenants intend to directly sign a contract with the landlord and pay rent in order to obtain legitimate rental rights. However, the landlord is deliberately delaying and attempting to extort a huge transfer fee, otherwise they will not sign a contract and order them to move out immediately. Can the three tenants sue the court to confirm their legitimate rental rights and continue to live? Since the landlord has terminated the lease, the three tenants are preparing to pay the rent directly to the landlord, but the landlord refuses to accept the rent, saying that the transfer procedures have not been completed. Can the three tenants pay on behalf of the landlord using the landlord's account name? [Answer by Lawyer Ya Xia] Can terminate the lease on the grounds of completely subletting and owing rent. If you have not signed another lease contract with the owner, then you must vacate the house. There is no rental relationship between the three tenants and the landlord, so there is no way to confirm it. There is no rental relationship, so there is no rent problem. I think saving is useless.</p>
<p>Sincerely ask for a job One Teacher: Thank you for your instructions and hard work. I read the words "Young people can work hard and will have a future. You must not become negative due to unemployment," which made my heart suddenly surge with enthusiasm and courage. How can I keep working hard! I have received secondary education and love literature. Recently, I became unemployed and wandered in Shanghai. In today's high prices, I have no relatives and my life cannot be sustained. Looking forward to the future, it is really bleak. I am now willing to work as an apprentice in a cultural organization, regardless of salary. I hope that people in the community will sympathize and help, and I will never forget it. I respectfully send An Zhang Rongbang (Correspondence address: No. 483, Henan Middle Road)</p>
<h3>Famine in Germany</h3>
<p>— Translated by Shi</p>
<p>A young man who is only fourteen years old, just because his father secretly ate the overnight food at home, he wanted to harm his own father. This unethical thing happened because of the pain, hunger, and hatred. The same thing is happening in Germany.</p>
<p>Another example is that a young woman wrote a letter to a newspaper reporter after she was heartbroken. She wanted to ask the reporter to tell her about the divorce procedures. As for the reason for her heartbreak, it was only because her husband secretly got up in the middle of the night one day and ate all the ration for the next day.</p>
<p>So the newspaper reporter wrote a letter to the young woman saying:</p>
<p>"Please forget the word divorce. Next time, just put a lock on the tree so that there will be no loss. This is a common problem. Thousands of women are troubled by similar things. At the same time, this is not what we men want to do. There is really no way to think about it! However, this is also your responsibility. Why didn't you take precautions in advance and not distribute the food equally to your family?"</p>
<p>This fourteen-year-old youth is now studying at a commercial school run by Christians. In general, welfare workers think so. If he is kept at home to live with his father again, it is very dangerous, because he hates his father so much. One day, (the day the incident happened), he childishly said to Hui School: "I stole a piece of bread, and exchanged that piece of bread for this package of poison. With the package of poison, I am going to kill my father." His classmates told their teacher about this, and the teacher, because he could not bear the innocent child being punished by law, asked the school workers to invite a few welfare workers. According to the results of the investigation by these welfare workers, the main reason was that his father ate the food that he should have been rationed.</p>
<h3>Bottled Seclusion</h3>
<p>— Liuyun</p>
<p>Qi Biaojia's Yushan Note records: "In the past, Shentu Youya, who released clouds and springs, often carried a bottle and jumped into the bottle from time to time, known as 'bottled seclusion'." In today's Shanghai, where the housing shortage is serious, I hate that Shentu's art has not been passed down. Otherwise, as long as everyone has a bottle, this serious housing shortage will no longer be a housing shortage.</p>
<h3>Talking About Juvenile Police</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Today, the newspaper published a piece of news saying that when the juvenile police went to the restaurant to inspect the wine and dishes, they "lost their manners" due to the laughter of the guests, and it was extremely difficult to perform their duties.</p>
<p>We know that juvenile police were originally a group of people wandering the streets; we also know that juvenile police should not be despised by others when performing their duties, and should not be ridiculed by others because of their "background". However, judging from what has happened, we really can't imagine what kind of attitude those diners had towards the juvenile police.</p>
<p>Just imagine: a group of juvenile police who usually use preserved radishes as dishes (quoting a certain newspaper) walk into those prosperous banquet places to work, and are still scorned and laughed at by the diners. How should they feel?</p>
<p>Originally, a banquet costing four million dollars was not taken seriously by some people. "I have money, what's it to you!" They sneered at the inspection of the juvenile police, thinking it was a "novel" thing, why bother to pay attention to it?</p>
<p>In order to prevent some people from being too happy, and in order to make the thrift order successfully implemented, I hope that the juvenile police will not be afraid of ridicule and serve the public; and I hope that the authorities can give the juvenile police appropriate power to deal with those illegal incidents. We believe that juvenile police should have a minimum of "dignity" _ that is: personal dignity.
