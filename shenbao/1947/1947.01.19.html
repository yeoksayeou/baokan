<h3>延安拒絕和談使者　政府今日發表聲明　改組問題照原計劃進行</h3>
<p>主席定今晚宴三方代表</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕蔣主席定十九晚宴政府政協代表孫科、張羣等及民社、靑年兩黨在京重要人土。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕共黨對政府所提議派員赴延安商談事，已有復電到京。十八日上午十時半，王炳南往訪司使，口頭傳達此項答覆，略謂：「中共仍堅持解散國大及恢復一月十三日軍事形勢兩點為和談之基礎，如政府不能接受此兩點，則政府亦不必派員赴延安，如可能接受，則共黨可即派員來京與政府進行商談。」王語畢旋即辭出。據聞：司使當時並未作何表示，下午五時半司使應蔣主席電召前往官邸，並即以王所吿之兩項意見予以轉達，至下午六時半返美使館。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕政府對延安拒絕和談事，十九日將發表重要聲明。據悉其內容，大致為：（一）檢討過去一年來和談經過。（二）公布此次恢復和談之四點新方案。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕和談新方案內容，據聞僅分四項原則：（一）和談方式，由政府派員赴延，或共產黨派員來京，其形式採圓桌會議，或其他方式；（二）立即停戰；（三）整軍及恢復交通，均照以前協議；（四）地方政權問題，雙方協商解決。</p>
<p>〔本報甫京十八日電〕政府改組問題，仍與和談均在同時進行中，各方所提意見亦甚多，今日孫寓集會時，雖未提出討論，但會後據孫氏語記者，和談雖因共產黨之拒絕而有波折，惟決不影響改組政府。</p>
<h3>民社青年兩黨表示　中共不應再提條件</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕孫科，陳立夫，邵力子，張厲生，王世杰，張羣，吳鼎昌張治中，雷震與民社黨張君勱，伍戀子，蔣均田，萬仞千，徐傳霖，靑年黨曾琦，左舜生等十六人，十八日下午五時就孫科寓舉行會議，對時局交換意見，因共產黨對政府派員赴延安己表示拒絕，當即討論閃一步驟。民社靑年兩黨人士先後發言，認為政府已表示希望和談重開，中共責不應再提何種先決條件，不啻關閉和平之門，政府代表亦僉表同意，認為政府誠意希望和談重開，今中共如再堅持兩條件，使政府無法考慮，則戰火之再燃，將為中共所引起，至下午九時三刻始散。據孫院長答覆記者詢問稱：政府對中共之答覆，日內將有重要表示，十九日當再舉行會議，交換意見，並謁主席報吿。又雷震談稱：政府對此事表示態度時，所提和談新方案內容，可能同時公布。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕政府所提和談新方案，十八日續在孫寓集會中提出討論，除在滬時已由雷震與各黨接觸交換意見外，本日曾再度愼重討論，略加修正。</p>
<h3>中共負責人談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕據新一華社延安十七日廣播，中共中央某負責人答新華社記者訽問，關一於商談和平事，竟完全表示拒絕一，幷對蔣主席及馬歇爾特使任意一侮蔑。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕據新華社延安十七日電，新華社記者，十七日訪問共產黨中央某負責人，詢以蔣介石是否有派代表來延之事？其目的何在？共產黨中央某負責人答稱：「十六日晨蔣介石經過司徒雷登通知南京共產黨發言人王炳南，說是要派張治中來延商談和平，但這完全是欺騙作用。蔣介石對於共產黨所提兩項最低限度要求「取消偽憲及恢復去年一月十三日軍事位置」旣然置之不理，就證明道所謂「和談」完全是欺騙。蔣介石的企圖，是要在侵佔解放區一百六十五個城，十七萬九千平方公里土地，但是打了敗仗，被人民解放軍殲滅了五十三個旅之後，求得休恩時間，鞏固已佔地方，補充軍隊，重新進攻，為了這個目的，他現在需要「和談」了。如果去年一月馬歇爾與蔣介石代表張羣親手簽字的停戰協定，可以被蔣介石撕毀乾爭，而馬歇爾則主持片面援蔣，發動內戰，則在現在又由一個美國人介紹一個姓張的來開所謂「和談」，試問有何辦法證明其不是欺騙。張治中氏本人，亦曾於去年三月二十七日代表將介石簽定了東北停戰協定，但是僅僅五天，就被蔣介石撕毀，在東北大打起來。此次再來談判，試問有何辦法證明談成的任何東西不被蔣介石在幾天之後加以撕毀。如果去年一月由蔣介石主持的政治協商會議的決議，可以由蔣介石撕毀乾淨，敢於另集非法「國大」，製造僞憲，保障獨裁，試問有何辦法證明現在的一所謂「和談」有一絲一毫的眞實一性，以此種種，我們對於現在喧一嚷的所謂「和談」，完全喪失信任，院非蔣介石取消偽憲及恢復去年一月十三日軍事位置，便無法證明他不是欺騙。因此，要開談判，必須實現這兩個條件，共產黨及全國人民，均不願再受欺騙了」。</p>
<h3>張申府論和談</h3>
<p>中共此時不應提條件</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕民盟代表張申府原定十八日飛平，以天氣惡劣作罷。自中共覆電公布後，記者曾訽張意見，張稱：中共不應於此時提出條件，美應共同商談，至於此兩點政府在原則上應予同意，但在實行上則應共同討論。張對改組政府表示應（一）有決心，（二）重民主精神，（三）要求國家進步，軍事上則可成立中立區，由第三者維持治安，對和談各問題，張表示仍願與政府人士接解。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟章伯鈞氏昨對記者稱：民盟是否參加和談，須視國共兩方意見能否接近而定，蓋若國共意見依然南轅北轍，民盟即使參加亦無裨益，渠認為和談能否恢復，繫於國共雙方之誠意如何，並否認張申府之赴京係負有任務。此外，張東蓀氏日內赴京，亦係料理私務。</p>
<h3>民社黨代表抵京　張君勱將提供和談意見　張羣雷震聯袂晋竭主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕雷震偕民社黨張君勱，任何傅霖，伍　子，蔣仞千，孫寳毅，蔣勻田等十八日晨抵京。雷下車後即於九時許與張舉聯袂晋謁主席，報吿滬上治商經過，並吿以民社，靑年兩黨人士業已被邀抵京，願共同參與商洽恢復和談與改組政府諸事。雷辭出後，即掛孫科寓邸，報吿一切。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕民社黨在京全體人士，十八日上午十二時在張君勱寓舉行會議，討論對政府所提和談新方案之意見，張君勱等均係應主席之召來京，張日內即將謁主席，提供意見。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕留滬各黨派代表陸續晋京，促進恢復和談。民社黨張君勱等一行八人，十八日晨抵京。渠等此來，對恢復和談滿懷期望，但不知中共業已公然拒絕政府派張治中赴延商談。據楊浚　吿記者稱：渠等十八日晨由滬搭車來京時，尙未聞此訊，渠因未閱及中共電文內客，不欲有所批評，但稱：願此來能與各方共同促成恢復和談。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕可靠方面消息：張君勱氏此次晋京，完全為最高當局誠意邀請之結果，聞張氏晋京前對友人表示，希望能於陰曆年關前返滬。又民社黨黨內人士希望將來和談正式重開時，張氏能經常代表出席，而不主張由他人代替，以求發言能正確代表民社黨之產塲。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨北方代表胡海門，梁秋水，本定昨日搭機飛平，因售票延誤，改於今日成行。此次言震離滬時，曾堅邀同章晋京，惟兩氏因北方黨務亟待整頓，故未同往。據聞：民社黨在北方之活動，遍及華北及東北，勝利後會吸收新份子，訓練工作亟待開展。又北方之黨員目擊人民遭受戰禍，故期望實現國內和平之心，較之常人為切。</p>
<h3>馬帥明返華府　當日宣誓就職</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十八日廣播，白宮頃宣佈：馬歇爾將軍下週一晨返華府，同日宣誓就職，即與杜魯門商談重要國事。開馬帥已辭去軍職，此後將以文官身份為國效勞。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十八日電〕今後美方調停工之發展，須待馬帥與杜魯門會晤後所決定之美國對華新政策而定。</p>
<p>觀察家預料美國對華政策不外下列三點：</p>
<p>（一）對中國時局演進採取放任態度，並無固定政策。</p>
<p>（二）完全置身事外。</p>
<p>（三）協助中國政府之政策，但須停止內戰，立即改組政府，以證明足以接受美方之協助。</p>
<p>此三項政策皆不能令人滿意，以馬歇爾之聲明觀之，美國似最有採取第三項政策之可能。</p>
<h3>馬帥行館闢謠</h3>
<p>拒絕蘇使參加調停說</p>
<p>某報所載完全無一根據</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十八日電〕馬歇爾將軍行館發言人今日宣稱，新民報昨日所載馬歇爾特使曾三次拒絕蘇聯駐華大使彼得洛夫願出而襄助調解國共紛爭之說，「完全無根據」。該報並謂，周恩來自滬回京恢復商　　，蔣主席即有台灣之行，係出馬歇爾勸吿，以便留有商談之餘地，亦屬不確，實則蔣主席台灣之行，月餘前即已決定，屬歇爾曾勸其稍留，至少有時間與周恩來在京一晤。</p>
<h3>國防部召開　法規整理會</h3>
<p>首次大會通過議程</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國防部十八日下午三時召開法規整理委會成立大會，由林次長蔚，劉司長孝元主持，計參加單位有海總部，陸總部，空總部，聯勤總部，軍職人事司，文職人事司，第一廳，第四廳，軍法庭，慰兵司令部，保安局，民事局，史料局等，本日會議聞係通過大會議程</p>
<h3>各種選舉法規</h3>
<p>王　惠吳尙鷹研究中</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕有關憲法之各種選舉法規，正由王寵惠及立院吳秘長尙鷹等作初步研究中，一俟在原則上有所決定後，立院專門委會即可作進一步研究</p>
<h3>西康人士請願團　要求撤換劉文輝</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕西康在京人士請願團，以該省軍民衡突日趨嚴重，十八日晟再赴國府請願，當由許局長靜芝接見，並允將該團所提撤換劉文輝及其所部兩項請求轉陳最高當局。該團旋又赴政院，國防部等機關請願，並於中午招待記者，報吿實情。</p>
<h3>接收大連問題</h3>
<p>傳蘇向我提出二要求</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京十八日電〕據接近外交部人士稱：中蘇二國政府代表，目前並不在進行關於中國長春鐵路之談判，惟長春鐵路問題與接收大連一事迫不相同，後者實無需進行談判。同時，報載蘇聯政府近會就大連問題向中國政府提出下述二項要求：（一）中國政府應承認蘇聯可取得敵偽財產，即蘇軍開入東北時所接收者，（二）日本佔領時所控制之中國長春鐵路，其管理權應交予蘇</p>
<h3>水豐電廠鴨綠江堰堤　蘇同意由我接防　水豐發電報產權我與韓國交涉中</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕蘇方同意我軍於廿日正式接防水豐水力發電廠鴨綠江上在我國境內之堰堤水豐發電所產權交涉，亦由資源委員會東北電力局與韓國方面直接進行，聞談判已臻且體化，該水力發電廠之產權及附帶利益，依照民國廿六年朝鮮與偽滿所訂合約，應由雙方各佔一半，該廠發電機原有七具，每具可發電十萬瓩，共七十萬瓩。日本投降後或被拆遷或被破壞，現僅存發電機三具，可發電卅萬瓩。按偽滿資產應歸我國所有之原則，我國應有該廠產權及發電量之一半。技現存備計算，輸送我國應用之電力，應為十五萬瓩，惟目下韓國電力雖極充沛，但其北部當局，僅其他電力三千瓩供我國安東之用，此二千瓩尙須以糧食布匹等物資作為交換，在東北工業生產積極推展需用電力至為殷切之現狀下，此次交涉倘能獲得合理之解決，寳對東北工業復一興有極大之貢獻。</p>
<h3>隨同生父出庭對質　沈崇女士悽然淚下　一聲「就是他」主犯驚惶失色</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十八日電〕美國駐華海軍陸戰隊第一師軍事法庭，公審美丘在本市東單操塲暴行一案，十八日上午九時繼續審判，午十二時十分完畢，下午一時半至三時十分續審，法庭人員除書記官較昨日少一人外，全體軍法官等均出席，傍聽者胡適，何思源”左明徹，孟昭楹，紀元，李士彤，趙鳳喈，張述先，呂寳東，沈劭，楊振淸及中外記者共十餘人。沈崇係於十時十分由其父陪同步入法庭，着灰皮大衣，燙髮，面色蒼白，精神似感疲憊。於二小時之審訊中，不時流淚，審訊吿畢，即行離去。胡適於審沈半途退席，何思源則始終坐於旁聽席上，對審訊情形極為注意。</p>
<p>楊格中尉報告筆錄　繼續審訊雙方證人</p>
<p>開庭復，首由檢察官助理楊格中尉報吿昨日審訊筆錄。繼即陸續審訊證人。</p>
<p>（一）張英傑（警察局事科員）供述，去年十二月二十四日晚値勤時，乘巡邏軍第二號巡邏，晚十一時許在東單為第一號巡邏車上警官截住，報吿美兵强奸沈崇小姐，彼下巡邏車時，為晚十一時三十分左右。是時見一號車右邊立一女郎，大衣上有土，面上亦有土，頭髮零亂有土，美兵大衣未扣，有土，唇上有血痕，彼即送美兵及沈小姐至美國海軍陸戰隊憲兵司令部，美兵坐於巡邏車前排右方，沈坐後排，其間有一美國憲兵及張本人，上車時，美丘欲扶沈，沈拒之。約夜一時（二十五日晨一時）抵美海軍憲兵部時，沈之姐丈楊君趕去談話十餘分鐘，旋又帶沈赴美國陸軍憲兵司令部，後即赴警察局，報告外事科孟科員，其後又赴警察醫院，首經值班醫官檢查約十五分鐘，繼經該院王院長詳細檢查，在院中停留約四小時。檢騐畢，又帶返警局，由孟科員詳詢沈小姐，錄有口供及指印，廿五日上午八時送至沈之姐丈住處。</p>
<p>（二）賈克伍長（美國海軍憲兵司令部士丘在中美聯絡室服務），法官令其指認被告，確認後彼稱：彼乃肇事之日收押被告者。</p>
<p>沈女自喻如鼠遇貓　掙扎再三氣力全無</p>
<p>（三）沈崇（被害人），首遵檢察官囑，於兩度環視法庭後，指出被告皮爾遜。旋供至廿四日止，來平方廿四天，住姐夫家，未婚，以前亦未曾結婚，在平入學費用，由父供給。來平前父親給五十萬元，抵平後沈父先後匯伊一次五十萬，一次一百萬元，均存放銀行中，不能說英語，但懂一點。繼叙當日被強姦之可怕情形，去年十二月二十四晚去看電影，由王府井南口向東，在平安影院對面路邊樹林旁，突有兩美兵將彼架走，一握左手，並手攬伊腰，另則握右手，樓伊勃子，伊呌喊「救命」時，美兵即以手掩伊之口，兩美兵先架至南大地南牆邊，強姦一次，是時發現手電光一次。強姦後，美兵拉伊向東，仍在南牆根下，又發現手電光，此次又擬強姦，因有手電光搜尋，故此次強姦未遂，繼拉彼至東大地空房，伊曾脫身逃出，然旋即被美兵抓住，同時滑入一溝中，但未跌倒，亦未跪覆。其後又被美兵拖至空房東北，該時黑暗看不見哈德門大街，當又被美兵强姦一次。沈供至此，又回述在南牆根時發現伊被脫下之褲子因係白色，乃拾起搖動求救，「喊呌時，被美兵用手將口掩塞」。當美兵在此處（南牆根）强姦時，另一美兵曾帮忙，腿上傷痕想係當時為美兵所損害，但該美兵旋即他去。彼時，曾又經掙扎喊呌，沈小姐比喻，謂此事就如鼠為貓捕獲，雖掙扎至再，終至氣力全無，復又被美兵拉至東大地空房，實已置生死於度外。此時，勃子被搯，不能再喊，其後又在東大地空房強姦時，忽有兩人以槍喝令美兵起來，彼三人似有爭鬥，此時，人愈來愈多。至檢察官又詢來平前情形，據供：年十九歲，民廿六年至卅五年在滬，在日本佔領時期，從未與外國兵社交，此事發生後，身上·腿上及下身均有傷痕。</p>
<p>嗣由被吿辯護人詰詢，詰詢中途，審判長根據軍法第二八二條宣布沈小姐對於有關當日以後事實之詢問，如有損及本身名譽利益者，可不答覆。沈對辯護人謂詢之供詞，為第一次被同意而完全在暴力下之性交？答曰：「在驚惶之下，不能知首」，當審沈中途，庭長曾宣稱，旁聽女賓，可自動退庭，其後即詰詢被姦時諸種情形，極為詳盡，極為詳審達二小時，至十二時十分休息，沈返寓。</p>
<p>醫師檢騐沈女傷痕　處女膜上有新裂口</p>
<p>午後一時卅分續審，（一）王和成（警察醫院院長兼主治醫師）供稱：係日本京都大學醫學博士，在該院已有一年二個月，廿五日上午二時卅分，對沈小姐檢騐後，始知其為沈崇，檢騐結果為：陰道下方處女膜上有一新鮮裂口，為·四四糎之磨傷，又於一月三日檢騐，發現（一）膝蓋組有二三糎寬一糎長之裂傷，成為血痂。（二）左小腿中部，有綠豆大之血痂，內圓外尖。被吿辯護人根據彼於廿五日對警局之檢騐報吿之第五段，評斷「是否被强姦尙難決定」一點，詰詢甚嚴，據供：許斷上係根據陰戶內無精蟲，故不能決定，最後，檢察官提出「强力致成或强暴力量致成創傷或同意創傷是否相同」一語詰詢，又補充謂：至暴力之解釋為加於精神上之威脅，王供其肉體劃傷大致相同。</p>
<p>（二）楊格中尉（檢察官助理）供，肇事日之天氣，氣候為無風，晚路黑暗。今日審畢，已至三時十分，審判長宣布廿日上午九時繼續公審。</p>
<p>沈女陳述歷歷如繪　美兵暴行全盤托出</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕沈崇，年十九歲，面色慘白，黃髪，外罩灰鼠大衣，淡肉色襪，外軍紅襪套，淡綠皮鞋。訊問姓名，籍貫後，起訴法官即問「請你指出被吿來」，沈即自左向右，看至右方盡處，見皮爾遜坐被吿席上，當即指出，二次指出後，法官再使沈近前指出，沈即近前針指皮爾遜，說「就是他」。皮恐懼萬分，法官乃令皮起立，確認後，沈即應問答，嗣法官即令沈述說當時受害情形，沈述說甚詳，必要處完全說出，歷歷如繪。若千言詞皆為一少女所不欲言者，而為證實皮爾遜之暴行，皆全盤托出。沈女士並答覆法官及被吿辯護人詢問有數點：（一）美兵夫給錢，（二）與任何外國人從無交際，（三）美兵數次暴行，均為强制，（四）一美兵曾出精，大衣後部濕一塊，生殖器曾入內，（五）膝部傷痕乃掙扎時所創，（六）最初被架，知美兵行為不良，但不識為强姦，（七）從示同意其强姦，且始終處於强暴下，（八）美兵是否醉，不知，（九）彼架走後神志即失措。</p>
<p>檢騐基師供詞不當　平市長等頓足搔髮</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕北平警察醫院主任醫師王和成，為日本京都帝大醫學博士渠今下午受訊時，說明渠於廿五晨一時餘，曾騐得沈女處女膜中心下部有一新破痕，長為零點四生地，子宮無大變化，其他正常。九天後，又騐得膝部有三指寬之擦傷，左腿下部正中有豆大血班，外園內尖，處女膜之破裂，應為非正常而强力的性交所致。沈崇曾吿其被强姦，但未發現陰戶內有精虫，故只能斷定曾受强暴的推入，而不能斷定為强姦，其後被告辯護人曾再三追問，經三次強姦與普通性交所致之傷痕是否相同，王似始終未弄淸「强暴」之意義，而謂强暴所致之裂痕應大普通則小，最復起訴法官則令譯員寫出渠之訊問示王，謂「強暴」與「普通」所致傷痕能否有別，王再詳詢所謂「强暴是僅指肉體的抑加於精神的」，乃再解釋包括因强暴而使神志失去抵抗，王始稱：此兩者所致傷痕無別，起訴法官提出此問題，曾遭被告辯護人反對，經引出法典辯護人始無言。辯護人曾提出依王和成說明檢騐沈女處女膜情况，能否認定沈女先此是否處女，當被起訴法官指係越範而反對未果。王之所答，措詞及醫學常識頗為旁聽之何市長思源及其他關心者所指摘。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕美兵強姦北大女生沈崇案，十八日續公審，上下午訊五證人，主要者為沈崇與事後檢騐醫師北平警察醫院主任醫師王和成，沈崇供詞詳盡而有條理，王和成則緊張嚴肅，起訴法官與被告辯護人為訊問事數度引證法律辭典，結果多為起訴法官勝利。旁聽者仍為昨日諸人，因王和成供詞不當，平市長何思源，沈女之父及旁聽之中國檢查官紀元與沈崇二法律顧問頓足搔髮，坐立不寗，除被害辯護人盡力找隙外，法官等態度相當公正，間有因翻譯不符，則以書面出示證人，中國旁聽人無不為此國際官司捏一把汗，十九日星期，廿日　　美方醫師及其他人。</p>

<h3>蔡勁軍對記者報告　瓊島施政狀况　治安問題最為嚴重</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十八日電〕粵省委兼省府瓊崖辦公處主任蔡勁軍，頃拾待記者，報吿海南島施政狀况。據稱：海南島目前最嚴重者當為治安問題，近經省府派六個保安團駐瓊，積極淸剿，同時加强地方基層組織，計已築成凋堡四八六座，尙有百餘座不日可成，並借發各縣輕重機槍二百餘挺，步槍萬餘枝，現巳成立十九個自衛大隊，尚有二五七個自衛班及加緊訓練幹部，實行政治動員。目前最收效者，為淸匪救鄉委會，地方士紳父老皆能踴躍下鄉工作，現第一期淸剿計劃已如期掃蕩完成，第二期正開始，預計短期內可將全島士匪　淸。至建設方面，資委會錢委員長昌照曾飛瓊視察，並計劃開發？惟先決問題，除治安外，必先求交通暢達，糧食能自給自足。光復後，瓊島公路受破壞大半，現經一再搶修，已全綫可通，同時並舉辦農田水利及合作事業，以增加農村生產。瓊崖資源甚豐，尤以漁鹽糖業易於經營發展，且與國民經濟關係至大，望國人踴躍移民投資，由於本島治安好轉，近蒞南洋各地歸僑，已有多批，過去數月統計僑匯約廿億元，本月已增加至五十億一元。蔡氏末稱：瓊島孤懸海外，實際情形國人每多隔閔，且土匪自慘敗後，專事謠言攻勢，且疑惑人心，如最近在京謠傳瓊崖米價每担廿萬元，其實本島九十月間因暴風洪水影響，米價曾一度高至九萬元，經平抑後，即已銳降。現全島米價最高為海口，每百市斤亦僅四萬元左右。至糧食統籌，政府與地方人土已先事綢繆，可保無虞云。</p>

<h3>青年團舉辦總甄核　發表告全體團員書</h3>
<p>〔中央對南京十七日電〕三民主義青年團中央幹事會，已決定自本月十五日起，舉辦全體　　總甄核，並將遞派常務　事，分赴各省　　導，以期　　辦理，如　完成。為使全體團員，　　總甄核意義起購見，特發表告全體團員書，　　四項要旨，　起全體團員之共同　　。茲錄全書原交於次：</p>
<p>本團全體同志們：</p>
<p>本團成立的目的，在集中國民革命新的力量，以求抗戰建國的成功，與三民主義之具體實現，在抗戰期問，我全體同志在偉大的團長領導之下，精誠團結，英勇奮鬥，用能鼓舞全國革命青年，統一意志，集中力量，為我神聖的民族抗戰，竭盡忠貞，以爭取最後的勝利。今勝利已逾一年，和平統一之障碍，尙未澈底掃除，三民主義之具體實現，允須加倍努力。本國第二次全國代表大會集會，值時檢討當前革命形勢，及今後團的任務，咸認整肅革命陳容，加强組織力量，實為今後革命所必需，爰經遵奉團長指示並一致決議，舉辦團員總甄核，第二屆中央幹事會成立以後，覆經愼密　議決定甄核辦法，簽　團長　　，茲需舉辦伊始，為揭數　，以　其　。</p>
<p>（一）整肅革命陣容　加強民國力量</p>
<p>這次本團舉辦團員總甄核，其意義有二：一為甄閱團的力量：十年以來，全　靑年在偉大的團長感召之下，踴躍參加本國，以効力於神聖的民族抗戰，陣容甚壯，貢獻亦大，但因發展迅速，而種種缺點，在所不免，如團籍不確實，基層組織不健全，團員與團之關係不嚴密，因而會令不能完全貫澈，任務難期如限達成；為矯正此種缺點，必需舉行團員總甄核，切實淸釐團籍，淘汰不忠實不守紀律的份子，加強組織的嚴密性，如軍隊然。欲其能達成作戰任務，必須注意校閱與點騐。故此次舉辦團員總甄核，即在健全本身檢閱力量，期能担負革命建國之任務。二為適應民主憲政的要求：本團二全大會以後，國家正步入憲政實施階段，現在國民大會，已經圓滿完成制憲工作，民主憲法，亦經政府明令公佈，本團今後任務在以民主　　，　　　　，主要　　政大會，參加建團工作。本團同志，應知民主憲政之　　，為多數取決，故　體之奮鬥，重於個人之奮鬥，如組織不健全，紀律不嚴明，　步　　期一致，力量無由發　。　　　甄核之又一意義，即欲集結革命青年於一個堅強組織之下，依民主方式，從事公　競爭，積極參加各級民意機關之　舉，由取得羣衆信任，進而為羣衆服務，由　　本團革命主張，進而發展眞正民權，　固憲政基礎。</p>
<p>（二）鞏固革命領導　掃除建國障礙</p>
<p>五十年國民革命，　本黨　領　，而本團之成立，實為國民革命新的力量之產生，當前破壞國民革命之反動勢力，一為武裝暴力集團的擁兵割據，破壞軍令政令統一，使本黨五十年來，為統一與民主而奮〔之偉大事業，受其威脅，一為貪官汚更，土毫劣紳，以及買辦奸商，肆其無厭之慾，煽揚物價，剝削自肥，造成人民與政府之距離。此兩大反動勢力，使中國政治紛擾落後，社會秩序紊亂不堪，此驪惡現象如不澈底銷除，則建國工作，無由推動，而欲銷除建國障礙，首當鞏固革命領導，澈底實行民權民生主義，使民族主義所獲得之成功，更有深厚不拔之基礎，以貫澈三民主義革命建國之理想。（下文轉入第三版）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>法國政局與英法締盟</h3>
<p>法國國民大會與參議院於十六日在凡爾賽宮舉行聯席會議，選舉法蘭西第四共和國總統，社會黨領袖歐禮和以四五二票的絕對多數獲選，具有臨時政府性質的勃魯姆內閣，即依照法國新憲法的規定，向歐禮和總統提出總辭呈，歐禮和以其功成身退，乃予以接受，並任命社會黨要人賴馬迪埃為內閣總理；賴氏奉命後，即與各黨派領袖會晤，着手進行組織新內閣事宜，並曾訪晤行將卸任之內閣總理勃魯姆曁前任內閣總理兼外長比杜爾，有所商談，尤為各方所重視，預料新內閣在各黨派的合力支持之下，不日即可成立，將使戰後法國臨時政體吿一段落，從此法國政治也就可走民主憲政的正軌了。</p>
<p>勃魯姆內閣自成立至辭職。恰巧是一個月，為時雖暫，但在這一個月內的政績，超過任何一屆的內閣，對內而言，戰後的法國，可謂多難的國家，尤其在金融經濟方面，千孔百瘡，使人民的生活，困苦到極點，政府當局若不能大刀闊斧，敢作敢為，是無法解決當前的經濟困難的；但自勃魯姆總理組閣吿成之後，憑其過去從政的經驗及其在政治上的智慧，就致力於抑低物價的工作，一方面命令全國商人，將批發及零售的價格，一律减低百分之五，另一方面又勸阻工人公務員要求增加工資及薪給，務使每一個法國人的生活，從此都能逐漸安定下來。勃魯姆實施這個抑低物價的政策，雖然也遭週到許多困難與障礙，但是實施的結果，却令人滿意，在法國政治史上是罕有的成績。</p>
<p>其次在外交上，勃魯姆總理曾親自赴英訪問，與英國首相艾德禮會晤，曾就英法兩國對於德國問題所當採取的政策，澈底交換意見，當即獲得雙方的諒解，而使彼此不同的意見，也漸趨於一致。英國允許將魯爾區英軍佔領區內的煤斤儘量供給法國，以救法國的眉急，這不能不說是勃魯姆總理在外交上的一大成就。同時此行對於英法締盟，又安排下一個良好的始基，聞起草盟約將在巴黎倫敦同時舉行，不久就可以成立了，對於今後歐洲局勢的發展，也有着極大的影響。</p>
<p>勃魯姆上次出任艱鉅，係應各方面的愛戴與擁護，同時為國家民族的前途計，在此危機四伏的時候，也不得不出任艱鉅，再為國家效勞。一個月來，對於內政外交，均有所建樹，可以說己完成任務，替繼任者開了一個良好的起點。功成身退，不再為國操勞，也是應該的；何况勃魯姆年老孱弱，對於國家的重任，實在不能勝任；所以勃魯姆的辭職，原在意料之中。現旣由賴馬迪埃繼任，組閣自無問題，但其今後的施政方針，不論其性質如何？必將繼續勃魯姆內閣的內政外交，一方面在國內繼續努力，以抑低國內的物價，務使民生得以安定；另一方面在外交上，則將與英國進行談話，以完成英法同盟條約，務使法國眞能成為英蘇之間的橋樑。</p>
<p>關於英法同盟約傳就，遠在去年的新春，國際上就充滿這種流言，當時法國臨時總統兼內閣總理顧盎曾公開發表演說：「法國必須設法成立英法同盟，作為法蘇同盟約補充，假如因為有這兩種的同盟條約，而能進一步締結英法蘇三國條約，那末最好也沒有了。」接着法國社會黨舉行全體大會，發表吿法國民衆書也說，「法國應與英國簽訂與法蘇同盟條約的類似性質的條約，藉以增强英法兩國人民在政治上經濟上之合作。」由此可知，英法締盟是法國社會黨的一貫政策，在社會黨要人賴馬迪埃執政下的法國，與英國締盟，是不會成問題的。</p>
<p>英法締盟約目的，乃在防制德國再事侵略，從而保障和平與安全。嚴格說來，英法締盟足以增進歐洲的和平；緣因戰後英法對於德國問題的意見，頗多背道而馳的地方，經過此次締盟談判之後，必能煥然氷釋，對於刻在倫敦舉行的四國外决會議以及三月問將在莫斯科召開的四國外長會議，討論對德奧和的必有莫大的裨益。但是在另一方面，我們不能不祖心蘇聯的誤會，若把英法同盟認為反蘇的西歐集團，則歐洲勢將分裂為東西兩個歐洲，觀於蘇聯駐法大使鮑格莫洛夫的突然返國述職，可知蘇聯對於英法締盟，仍不免有所疑懼。我們認法國不僅須消除蘇聯對於英法同盟約誤會，而且還得促進英蘇關係，法國外交政策的成敗實繫於此。</p>

<h3>沭陽共軍倉卒敗退　城內房屋倖全　錢集戰况慘烈受災極重</h3>
<p>〔本報淮陰訊〕國軍於十日中午陰雨連綿之際，用迅雷不及掩耳之勢，一舉收復沭陽，共軍猝不及防，倉皇潰退，渡過沭河，向魯南方面奔竄。記者隨同孫省民廳長王公璵等乘孫寗分署淮險辦事處吉普卡於十一日午出發，馳赴戰地視察，迨至該縣南郊，已見民衆扶老携幼，歡迎道上，當由王廳長在車上起立、加以撫慰，宣達中央及省府德意，聽者灤爲感動，多喜極淚流，中一白髮老叟，更已泣不成聲迨經勸止，始悉叟陳姓，年逾古稀，生有二子，皆被共軍殺害，田被分了，屋被拆了，日食維艱，苟延殘喘，現在痛定思痛，故遂恍如嬰兒見母，悲從中來。</p>
<p>嗣即驅車入城，巡禮一週，城內房屋完整如故，爲之稍慰。殘酷共軍，竟能留此全璧拱手讓人，實亦奇蹟，常即擇一老者，詐加探詢，據云：「共軍內江劇烈，士無鬥志，已於放棄前夕，決定驅民出城，實行焦土政策，將全城付之一炬，所幸國軍進展神速，使其措手不及，稍緩須臾，即將不保，留此殘餘住所，以便棲止，悉受國軍之賜，殊屬意外幸事，共軍殊無人道，豈肯輕易放過，臨退時殺害良民達六七百人之多，現在城區六鄉鎭，約有三千餘戶，靑壯已被裏脅一空，僅剩老弱婦孺，宛轉呻吟於蹂躪摧殘之餘，重睹天日。」</p>
<p>一行十餘人踏進新安部隊師部大門，——偽第六行政區專員公署的一部份——房屋寬敞，師長張靈甫含笑出迎，一一握手爲禮，七區專員紀毓智呼以「勝利將軍」，張氏連稱；「不敢當，不敢當。」就坐後，即由社會部專員宋自新與王廳長商洽救濟辦法，決定請政治部派員，協同城區六鄉鎭長，先行調查戶口確數，每戶塡證一紙，按證發給賑款一萬元，並由蘇寗分署淮陰辦事處主任張通謨漏夜返淮，趕運麵粉，運到即再按戶發放麵粉一袋，以資急救，王廳長暫留該縣，督導縣政，籌劃興復，並協助辦理救濟事宜，惟迄晚該縣湯縣長曁縣府人員均仍未見到達。</p>
<p>歸途張主任告記者；沭陽火鎭錢集，面臨六塘河，共軍憑險死守，戰况慘烈，現該鎭上　舍爲墟，僅存一片瓦礫，前運去麵粉二百四十袋，豆粉一百二十袋，竟找不到一個救濟的對象，只有將麵粉暫存該鎭，託由附近地方人士導赴四鄉實地查放，於此可見該地災况一斑云。</p>

<h3>蘇州徵賦差額仍鉅　正努力解除癥結中</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州十八日電〕蘇田糧處十八日晨邀集新聞界，闡述征賦近况及匱乏之癥結所在，據副處長劉迪生氏謂：本縣賦糧己征起十四萬石，然距離四十萬石定額，仍懸殊極鉅，究其癥結，首在佃租糾紛問題，按全縣田額共一百八十萬畝，而管業田的佔十分之七，地主執於糧從租出之成見，須待收租後始能納賦，而佃農則藉口收成遜色，雖實施二五減租，仍屬因循觀望，致發生滯　現象，實爲糧政最大之困難，現縣府已成立佃租調解委會，冀謀業佃間之協調，正在切實執行中。次則圖正把持，意存中飽，亦爲重要癥結之一，據本處調查所知，田賦開征，迄今已屆兩月餘，而若干糧戶，竟有尚未奉到納糧通知單者，言之殊堪痛心，雖曾力求避免圖正之把持，終因全縣糧戶共達六十七萬名之多，苟全賴額定之十六名糧警分送通知單，事實誠不可能也。再次則前任工作太不緊張，以致貽誤時機，省令原定九月十五日須開征，卒延至十一月間始遵辦，現省限一月底必須徵足，遲則將受嚴懲，現本處已規定自十六日起一律加征滯納罰金。再前因供應軍糧國允納糧以稻米兼收為原則，惟因適應環境，業自十五日起純收稻穀，不收糙米。</p>

<h3>青年團舉辦總甄核　發表告全體團員書</h3>
<p>（上接第二版）</p>
<p>（三）確守職業崗位　參加基層建設</p>
<p>本團第一次全國代表大會時，團長曾發表手著之「中國之命運」一書，指示靑年應爲五項建設運動努力，並勗勉靑年做工程師，飛行員，邊疆屯墾員，小學敎師，鄉社自治員，此次二全大會，團長更剴切訓示我們，靑年應爲五項建設而努力，二全大會宣言，復明白揚示，我們今後的工作方向，要趨向於積極的建設，要從空洞的政治活動，轉向於社會基層服務工作，這種種啓示在喚起我們靑年同志的一個基本認識，認淸我國過去民權主義之不能實行，主要的是由於一般人的作官觀念作祟，民生主義之不能實行，主要的是由於一般人的發財觀念作祟，今後國家將走上民主憲政的新階段，本團組織與領導的方式亦應走上一個新階段，要使靑年依民主方式，從羣衆選舉中產生來參加實際政治，以堵塞個人鑽營作官的路，從而根絕不勞而獲之游民集團，要以民主力量保證民生主義之澈底實踐，以堵塞個人投機發財的路，從而根絕妨害社會經濟正常發展的游資勢力。我們靑年，要想使中國成爲一個現代化的國家，就必須人人立定決心，確定職業途徑，拿起工具，走入農塲，工廠，礦山，和研究室，從事實際生產技術工作，把我們的身心手腦，直接貢獻到建設國家的偉大事業上，這個偉大事業，將須經歷一段極艱苦的過程，我們在今日，尤須耐心拿起落後的工具，忍受職業崗位的微薄報酬，以奠立國家建設的初步基礎，爲了切實領導靑年走上職業生產的道路，我們所以必須舉辦一次團員總甄核，來檢查我們這個革命集團的份子，確定我們今後組織與領導的新途徑。</p>
<p>（四）樹立革命作風　完成甄核任務</p>
<p>本團三全大會栓討過去八年工作，認為我們的革命隊伍中，尚殘存着若干消極的份子，和敷衍的作風，因而减低了團的積極性，革命性，鬥爭性和政治性，這種缺點的存在，不是偶然的，必須發動一個全團的積極的自我批評，和相互批評的運動，才可以澈底糾正這種缺點，因此舉辦團員總甄核，就是一種積極的，廣泛的革命敎育作用，要以此來敎育我們的幹部和同志，勇敢的，自動的來糾正我們的缺點，使我們這個革命集團，能够不斷的進步，不斷的產生一般活潑潑的新力量。我們甄核的目標，就在加強團的革命力量，我們甄核的方法，就必須很客觀的，爲革命利益而努力，我們要本任務任怨和「視惡如仇」的精神，嚴格執行我們的甄核工作，無論幹部或團員，應深刻認識這個意義，競競業業，認眞辦理甄核，合格的團員，須重行宣誓，並舉行財產登記，以表示我們對主義對團長的忠誠，以及切實實行團結，爲國家盡忠，爲人民服務的決心。我們要建設國家，改革社會，必須先從改革自己做起，一個革命集團，要有勇氣正視一切現實的缺點，個個抱定最大決心，一秉至公，毫不徇情，時時加以料正，須知姑息足以養奸，去腐始能生新，我們要喚起全團上下的共同警覺，將一切落後的思想和行動，一切腐惡份子，澈底掃除，樹立一種革命的作風，以免我們這次團員總甄核</p>
<p>同志們：我們現在的革命環境，雖然險阻百出，反動勢力仍在盡其破壞阻撓之妄圖，但回想我們總理當年革命時環境的惡劣，較之今日實不知超過若干倍總理以不屈不撓的精神，終於消滅反動勢力，在辛亥年推翻滿淸政府，其後在中華革命黨時代，及十三年本黨改組的時候，總理均能適應時代環境的需要，整飭革命陣容，以領導國民革命事業，繼續前進，我們今日在英明偉大的團長領導之下，以繼續總理革命的意志，正當神聖的民族抗戰已獲勝利，民主憲法已經頒佈的時候，我們同志可以自信能够克服當前一切困難，消滅所有反動勢力，以澈底實行三民主義，完成革命建國的歷史任務。</p>

<h3>私校學費問題</h3>
<p>記者先生：最近私校增收學費問題引起許多人的討論。我們以爲這一個嚴重的敎育問題，決不能但憑意氣下斷語，更不能根據少數例證而將一般眞正辦學的私校當局們視作「一丘之貉」。</p>
<p>在普及敎育的原則下，我們希望全國的學齡兒童都有受敎育的機會。上海全市有學齡兒童四十五萬，平均以每校收容五百人計算，應該設立國民學校九百所。然而公校因限於經費只有二二七校，僅及四分之一，尚有四分之三的學齡兒童，不得不求安插於私校。萬一公校擠不下，私校又辦不成，大多數中產以下的家庭，侷處斗室，別無周轉餘地，他們那些活潑好動的子女們，勢將成羣結隊的流浪於街頭！</p>
<p>熟心敎育人士注意到私校學生的程度高下，連帶考慮到私校敎師的素質問題。許多私校校長爲了要聘需請優良的敎師，不得不提高敎師們的束脩，安定敎師們的生活。可是學費收入敵不過物價的騰踊，因此學期未了，便要籌措敎員「生津」的補貼，甚至本身的力量不够，還得求助於大衆。即如去年的「尊師運動」就以募集一尊師金」爲目標，當時固然受若干人士的指摘，但發起該運動的動機總不能算錯。我們絕對主張私校校長們在經濟公開原則下，儘量維持敎師的生活，提高其敎學的效率。換句話說，只要經濟公開，家長們增加多少學費，使敎師們安心執敎，循循善誘，直接受惠的還不是他們自己的子弟。這樣比較向陌生人募捐，捐到了錢塡飽敎師的肚皮後再來為自己子弟敎書，豈不漂亮多了麼？　憲法已頒佈了，人民該更有法律的保障，敎師亦該更有職業的保障。我們希望所有的私校當局都能够一秉至公約辦學，和敎戰員們同甘苦，爲國家的新生再敎育。我們絕不忍把高尚的「學府」，視同商店。希望主持「學府」的校長先生們亦不要因爲少數人的批評，而感到灰心和失望。我是貴報每日必讀的一個警察，上次閱到所載公務員待遇調整，七折八扣的警察包括一切費等在內，計十五萬五千元，當局諒解的原故，在舊曆年內，提早在本月十五日前提發一月份新金，給警察人員過年費用，但是至今所加的辦法各分局未收到通知命令，恐怕父是〇吧！假如先拿了一月份薪金過年費用，請問公正先生們，這區區之數，怎樣能够解決久窮的警察人員們經濟問題呢？過了舊曆年後，難道警察們就不過活了嗎？我家計有九口，父母將近六十歲了，弟妹還在求學的時代，可憐的妻子，領了三個小女孩子，我每月拿十萬一千五百元，在現今物價像氣球的飛昇的漲，我家中所有的東西當盡賣絕了！我們警察責任重大，保護人民生命及產財，而比不上一個小女孩在工廠內做工的待遇，他們有年賞，有勤工賞，有賞工，另外送一個月工錢，我們是人民表率，人民模範，我們是有智識的，不發一言，不罷崗，不怠崗，靜候當局來解決我們的困苦，公正先生們：給我們警察一個同情吧！（李耀祥）</p>
<p>省市劃界要速決定</p>
<p>滬市與蘇省劃界問題，爭持不決已歷一載，此次內政部派員會同省市雙方親臨察勘，允將問題從速解決，特將意見及願望，列陳於后：</p>
<p>（一）上海扼長江咽喉，處江南富庶之區，爲全國財富集中之地，其所備條件之優越，殊足助其發展成爲仳界一等都市，國父早鑒及此，因有大上海計劃之訂立民國十六年行政院並　訂滬市界址，以為發展之張本，今日自應依照原議，遵循先知先覺之指示，促使計劃早日完成，寗用遷延不決，致　發展。</p>
<p>（二）此次世界大戰，遠東原有巨埠，如馬尼刺東京大坂香港新加坡等處，悉遭嚴重破壤，恢復困難，而滬市受損最輕，復興最易，是以更有希望發展成爲世界一等都市，戰後全市人口已較戰前增加三分之一，實爲明證，且正繼續發展，前途不可限量，故對於市區範圍之擴大，實已迫不容緩，縱無　父上海計劃昭示於前，亦應以適應時勢之所需，予以合理之擴張。</p>
<p>（三）鄰境各縣以保持歷史關係爲藉口，將滬市應接管區域，拒下移交，顯為　狹而後不顧事實，且所謂歷史關係，初無一成不變之理，縱觀世界各國一等都市，無非逐漸擴大而成，故蘇省府以保持歷史關係爲理山，堅持成見將迫使滬市氷無與世界各大都市並駕齊驅之日，此不獨與滬市發展不利，復與整個國家利益有損，蘇省府自應以國家利益為重，放棄成見。</p>
<p>（四）省市雙方發生爭執之區域，以蘇省總面積而言，直如九牛之一毛，無損大體，而於滬市發展，則不可或缺，裨益殊巨，且隸省隸市，均屬中央，蘇省府實無堅持不放之必要。</p>
<p>（五）爭持各地之人民生活習慣，由於邇來交通建設，突飛猛進，早與滬市完全同化，而與原屬縣治反爲隔膜，故以人民生活習慣言，亦應擴大滬市範圍，以應自然情勢之所趨。</p>
<p>（六）以七寳一鎭而論，原隸上松靑三方管轄，致行政不能統一，數百年來，人民所受痛苦，罄竹難書，故更需調整隸屬親係整個劃入滬市，以求全鎭之統一。</p>
<p>（七）勝利以來，滬要七寳莘莊等處，所有保田組織，衛生機構，以及敎育事業等等，均已由滬市次第建立，如一旦仍令劃還蘇省，勢必又起紛擾，朝令暮改將使人民無所適從，爲維護政府威信計，亦不宜再行更變。</p>
<p>（八）過去省市雙方界綫至不明確，常易引起糾粉，如以民國十六年所定界址為標準，（西經小淶河為省市分界）則旣符以天然劃界綫為劃界之原則，並可使省市界址更臻整齊而明確，對於日後行政推行，裨益殊甚。</p>
<p>以上數端，除聯名再墾內政部飭省市兩万平日移交外乞予披露，以見興情。</p>
<p>祥德路修路要求</p>
<p>祥德路馬路之路面，向為煤竹路，十數年來，失於修理，復經十輪大卡車之往來紛紜，更形成大小窟洞，下雨之後，該路便成澤國，苦無下足之處，而居於該路之居民，多屬經商，不明手續，用特懇貴報刋出，俾達工務局予以興修，設若修築馬路之經費過大，可吾塡築行人道，即使略出經費，居民等亦所願童，轉瞬雨季即屆，並乞工務局，早日飭負辦理，是居民日夜之所盼望者也。（祥德路歐陽子輝）</p>

<h3>四外次草擬德和約　蘇聯提出四項建議　解決賠償問題將最感棘手　英法主張成立德中央政府</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕四國外次會議於本日午後開始草擬對德和約，首先確定各盟國政府列席陳述意見之次序，繼即討論四國外長分別授與其外次之訓令，尤其是關於程序問題之訓令。蘇聯代表古賽夫提出四項建議如下：</p>
<p>（一）確定和的草案之內容，俾提交莫斯科四國外長會議討論。（二）由四强與其他盟國進行會商。（三）凡曾積極參與對德戰爭之各國，均得參加和約之審議工作。（四）關於和的之最後起草，以及其在簽訂後之實施問題。各代表對於古賽夫所提之建議均表歡迎，但法國代表繆維爾則堅持盟國閱之合作，應更爲密切，俾避免錯誤與遷延。本日會議因蘇聯代表熊度緩和，故空氣頗爲樂觀，現定於二十日繼續討論對奧和的，廿一日討論對德和約。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕四外長代表德國問題會議聆取小國代表意見之時間表，已經重訂如下：澳大利亞一月廿三日，南斯拉夫廿四日，加拿大廿五日，波蘭廿七日，南菲廿八日，比利時廿九日。四强代表今日下午曾就下列問題加以分析以供討論：（一）外長會議所將採用之起草方案，（二）外長會議與盟國政府徵求意見之方法，（三）與盟國政府討論草案之方法，（四）起草最後階段之程序。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕英國方面今日預測蘇聯將向美國借欵五十億元，作爲減低對德賠償要求之代價。外長代表起草德奧和的時，殆以賠償問題爲最感棘手。據經濟學者雜誌稱，蘇聯曾要求德國賠償一百億美元，但於現時獲得半數，其經濟價値將遠較全數賠欵爲巨，</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十七日電〕英代表今日在四外决會議建議，即行討論組織德國臨時政府一事，俾在簽訂最後和約前，先成立關於管理德國之協讓，蘇代表古賽夫對此建議答稱：余未獲在四外次會議席上討論此項問題之權，應請提交莫斯科四國外長會議討論之。法代表暗示願先望四國成立德國中央政府之協議，然復與之簽訂最後和的，據悉，南斯拉夫所提奧境卡倫西亞一千二百方哩之領土要求，引起英美二國之驚異，蓋較預期之要求大出三倍故也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕四外長代表會議已決定奧國和的應明白規定不得與德國合併，各代表並已同意承認奧地利爲獨立國，但欲其保蹬民主政府，確保其人民應享受各種基本人權。對奧和的序文已或立協議，其內客對於奧地利不褒不貶，但的略敍述其歷史，指出其曾受德國控制，從而减輕其戰爭責任。各代表復議定奧條約主文應分政治·軍事及經濟等三章，政治章之草案應於下星期一交付討論，蘇代表表示蘇政府或不擬掛出奧條約之草的，當於討論他强所提之草的時隨時發表意見。各代表此外並決定不將一切文件交各小國傳閱，僅於某一國聲請閱覽時始交該國。至於邀請各小國陳述意見之請柬，的可於週末發出，何時邀其列席，當以電話通知其代表。</p>

<h3>義艦隊分配　載明和約則</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕國務院今日公布義和的之附則，首次透露義艦隊被分配之詳情。各艦名稱前此均嚴守秘密，深恐艦員知後故意加以破壞。權威方面相信，各艦名單係由紐約外長會之海軍委員會最後議成，該會尚須與四强政府磋商，以決定何艦應交四强中之何國。若此一問題不能由海委會或經由外交途徑獲得解決，可能再在莫斯科之四强外長會中討論。義和約之簽字將不受四强分配義艦之影響。根據該附則，義大利將喪失主力艦三艘·巡洋艦五艘。驅逐艦七艘·魚雷艇六艘•潛水艇八艘，及單桅小艦一艘。其餘之艦可由義國保留。喪失之主力艦三艘爲「凱撒」號·「義大利」號及「維多利亞凡尼多」號，喪失之巡洋艦爲「薩伏亞」號·「勃魯齊號」「加里波的」號·「蒙特古戈利」號·及「卡杜那」號。</p>

<h3>從一個英國人眼光中看盟國佔領下的日本（二）</h3>
<p>— 約翰·摩里斯原著　張德乾譯</p>
<p>（二）兩項任務</p>
<p>要估訂佔領第一年的成績，先得把佔領的宗旨弄個明白。照我看，佔領軍有兩項主要的任務。第一，就是所謂消滅日本的戰力，不論是現實的或是潛在的，以免她將來再爲我們的禍害。第二，是永遠消滅日本人擾亂世界和平的意志。自然，這兩項目的在某種意義下是相輔相成的，尤其是第二項爲許多別的問題的根源，顯然更爲重要。</p>
<p>軍事力量　不復存在</p>
<p>日本的軍事力量已經大部消毁，不足爲我們的威脅了，佔地數英畝的毁壞了的工廠足爲鋮證。而且現在的日本旣沒有陸軍也沒有海軍，她的商船也已經在戰爭結束以前，大部份被擊沉了。今日的日本似乎和第一次大戰結束後的德國差不多，但是在事實上却是不能够相比的。德國有數千英哩的陸地邊界，國內有充分的原料足以供應爲從事戰爭所必要的重工業，佔領一終止就不能够阻檔德國重整軍備。還有一層，在第一次大戰中德國工業資源的毁壞和混亂，照如今的標準看來，簡直是不足掛齒的；換一句話說，協約國雖然勝利了，德國的戰力却一點也沒有毀壞。</p>
<p>就今日的日本而論，她的國土已經削剩四個主要的互相毗連的島嶼，即所謂日本本土也者。她現在旣沒有陸軍也沒有海軍，太平洋上所有戰略基地都在盟國手中，盟國自然就容易控制日本國內的一切動態了。還有一層應當注意的，日本的重工業全仗輸入品。她本國所產的鐵很少，要製造高等的鋼是無用的，日本的煤也祗够家用。因此我們可以認爲，佔領日本的第一個目的（即毁滅日本的戰力），縱使尚未完成，也已經距完成不遠了。當然日本是不能够獲得必要的器材和設備來從事原子研究的。</p>
<p>我們現在再來談佔領日本的第二項更久遠更重要的任務。要在這兒評價此項任務的進展是有點困難的，因爲沒有一種適用的標準可以用來衡量此項任務的進展是快是慢。所以我祇想報告事實，讓讀者自己去下判斷。</p>
<p>思想頑固　難以改變</p>
<p>我這次在日本住了六個月，曾和幾百個日本人談話過，各種階級都有。我從沒有覺察到，他們有一絲認錯的意思。多數人的態度都和戰前一個樣子。有好幾次我簡直疑惑起來，這次戰爭究竟發生過沒有，因爲在日本社會的某種階層內（尤其是高級公務員），一提起這次戰爭就好像是有失儀態似的。然而多數日本人已經感覺到他們的失敗，同時却以爲他們領袖的過失並不在做得不對，而在做得不好。每一個人都在那兒談着新發現的民主政治，可是我從沒有碰到過一個日本人能給民主政治下個滿意的定義的。現在全國日本人都願意而且希望幹民主政治，同時多數日本人顯然祗是在那兒幹而已，在他們的思想中少有基本的改變。祗有在智識份子和學生中間，才有人眞的希望發生激劇的變化。</p>
<p>要毁滅日本的戰意，在我看來，根本是一個長期的敎育問題。但在詳細討論這一問題之前，我們必須先將牠的經濟和政治牽涉，大略叙述一番，因爲牠們對於整個敎育問題的解決是有直接關係的。</p>
<p>盟國一致　最關重要</p>
<p>我們似乎必須恢復日本的經濟至相當程度，以免她成爲盟國的一種負担。主要的困難在決定日本的工業應該如何改組，使牠不能再供戰爭之用。日本工業的組織必須以盟國和全世界的利益爲前提。在這方面我們已經有一點進展，但因世界一般局勢的不安定，和有關各國的顯然的利益衝突，此項進展已經受到阻碍。最顯著的例子是糧食政策和賠償問題。幾乎每一次在東京舉行的盟國會議都要發現幾種新的困難。要不是爲了三大强國和蘇聯之間所存在的根本不同的意識形態，這些困難多數是很容易解決的。</p>
<p>除開日益顯著的意識形態方面的衝突之外，還有比較不顯著的是在永久政治勢力方面的競爭。在這種競爭中，除開美國人以外都不能够順利進行，意識形態問題，在重整日本政治社會制度方面，甚至於更顯得重要。在此範圍內，最少眞實的進步，値得記載。日本在社會和政治方面的改組，必然地將依照着美國的型式發展，結果，別國的勢力就必須比例地减少了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕通濟輪船公司滬口（口岸）綫輪芷江號，於十七日九時，滿載乘客，由上海開出，於船抵吳淞口時，黑夜中與公益拖駁公司之華通號鐵駁相撞。芷江為木壳輪船，本已破舊，一經相撞，船身即吿破裂，逐漸下沉，而船上乘客裝有八百餘人之多，出事時呼喊求救，幸有吳淞口附近專事救生之小鐵船多艘趕抵失事地點，立即搶救。直至四時許共救獲七百餘名。據悉芷江輪下艙，尚有屍體數具，又據當塲目擊者云：該輪曾有男女旅客多人被擊落浦江，屍體逐浪而去，但確實之死亡人數，目前尚無法獲悉云。事後水警當局將芷江（通濟輪船公司）二副汪樂興，華通輪船主張晋聲兩人，一倂帶所偵訊。據汪樂興供稱：奉化人，住楊樹浦平凉路三九三弄四四號，芷江輪出口，載有旅客八百餘人，華通輪進口係一空船，當出事時，我曾拉回聲二聲，華通輪方面沒有桅燈懸掛，也不打回聲，且其兩邊均有鐵駁，不便避讓，故而失事云云。嗣據張晋聲稱：華通倫進口時，是依照規定，靠石硬行駛，因芷江輪要越過我船，所以被撞石腰部。芷江輪雖曾拉過汽笛，但因時間急促，故無法避讓云。</p>
<h3>孩童一名得慶更生</h3>
<p>又悉此次搭乘芷江輪之旅客，多係單幫，先後從船中氽出之物品甚多，計有軍毯一條，錫箔一袋，綢棉袍一件，布長衫一件，格子紡衫褲，破棉被三條，襪子數雙，小孩帽十九頂，被單一條，香烟五十三条，餅乾二聽，灰毯一條，木箱一只，小孩膠鞋一雙，便鞋一雙，法幣十萬元等。該項貨品暫存水上警察分駐所，移解分局存置。</p>
<p>又當營救至黎明四時左右，大都旅客已被救起。當時有一〇一四七號警士徐銀光，忽開該輪艙板有敲擊聲，遂用力踢去窗板，始發現內有十四五歲之童孩一名（姓氏不詳，泰興人）其時水已淹人其頭頸，命在片刻，於是設法救出，得慶更生。</p>
<p>又芷江輪之受傷乘客，送往中美醫院醫治者，計有重傷者二人，輕傷者五人。其中楊堰，田中南，曹蒼正，陳靜林，汪兆月等五人，經院方包紥後即出院。重傷之二人，一名蔡志林，未及抵院已氣絕身死。一名周海根，亦因傷勢過重，迄晚尚未脫離險境。據悉周年四十四歲，泰興人與死者蔡志林原屬親戚，此次同來滬地，係購辦年貨。前晚出事時，二人本已落水，旋為人打撈救起。然因飲水過度，且在打撈時遭鐵鈎傷，致蔡未及抵院已因傷重身死云。</p>
<h3>航政局長談話</h3>
<p>據上海航政局局長李孤帆談：芷江輪肇禍之責任問題，尚在調查中，唯航政局芷江輪載客之限度為三百五十七人，今聞該輪所裝乘客竟超過一倍以上，故遭此意外事件，通濟公司當局實應負全部責任，除派員會同該公司人員趕赴出事地點詳為調查外，已飭令公司當局將失事經過妥實報吿航政局，航政局亦已飭囑通濟公司妥為辦理善後，並於短期內，商討決定芷江輪死難乘客之撫卹及財物損失之賠償等問題。李氏又談稱，航政局對木壳航輪於開航前之檢查，本極嚴格，此次失事後，將更提高檢查之標準，同時對木壳輪之行駛亦將逐步予以取締，俾减少此種不幸事件之發生。</p>
<p>據悉：此次售票，全由寰球運輸公司代辦，通濟公司當局於事前並未知悉有如許之乘客，故此次出事之責任問題，寰球運輸公司亦難辭其咎。又昨日獲救之一部份乘客，業經通濟公司車送回滬，此批乘客當即至慈淑大樓通濟公司要求退票，致發生紛擾。</p>

<h3>買戶需求殷切　金價抑而復漲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨縱有央行壓力，無奈求戶十分擁擠，繼續蠢動，晨開即微挺至三七三萬有買，上場時尙費掙扎，三七五萬以上尙有壓力，而稍　　，迄十時後，央行以三七五萬之價，配給二七〇條，入後新買十分分殷切，央行暫取觀望，終於穿出三八〇萬大關外，見三八四萬高價，央行逢高再來供給，稍現掙扎，曾回降至三七六萬，但以實銷方面，繼續需用，午刻又回出三八一萬，午後逢週六更少變化，喊價仍在三八二萬左右，較前收漲起十二萬五，銀元猛昂一成，歲時關係，實銷暢旺，暗息銀根見緊，自一角半至二角不等。</p>
<p>外幣反見平庸，金市之助力，稍有拉上，美鈔暗市初六千四左右，後以金價拉高，午刻升至六六〇〇元，午後逢週六無甚變化，結果較前收漲一五〇元，港票仍乏榮辱，港匯昨升至一二三〇元及一二五〇元，印匯一五〇〇元至一五二〇元，英匯一九七〇〇元至一九八〇〇元，成交仍祇港匯略有做開，餘有行無市。</p>
<h3>場外貼價見增華股逐步拉高</h3>
<p>華股昨第十一期遞　交登塲，倍形不定，初低繼高，掉期貼息亦然，初時因金融帮興業等貼進而降至二十二元，合日息不過一角二，後以塲外大戶出現進遞，息價扶搖直上，達二角八之多，遞永紗頗有扳高，各小型股在零散游資，吸收下已下，均見上升，晨開見低，上塲時多空互有掉期而多盤，二三一號二二四號一九六號一六號二二號二二六號咸納，掉期見低，而升至遞交七六七元，現交七四〇元，一四號下時供給，九七號一六號一五二號一七二號一九六號亦賣規永紗，曾回落至開市價，一九八號七六號一四五號二〇號一八六號七八號等均進，　金市趨昂，塲外貼價見增，曾逐步拉高至即交七五〇元，遞交七九〇元高價，一四五號一二九號三〇號等賣出現永紗，始稍低降，近午轉盤，收後稍昂，套利貼價亦步升至永紗三七元貼出，信和十元貼出，各小股求者股切，均以高價結束，結果較前收計永紗美亞華豐微升，信和微降，景福勤興漲半成强，新光漲起百分之八，最爲生色，冷股永公漲半成，餘升降俱見，遞交計永紗美亞勤興華豐微升，新光漲一成弱，信和好半成，塲外各股除大生續在挺進中，餘者升降俱見。</p>
<p>外股昨僅一小時成交，十一時後，即因查帳之故而停頓，各股升降不一，結果較前收計各股升降俱微。</p>
<h3>債市沉寂</h3>
<p>公債昨更爲沈靜，成交稀微，統丙晨開二〇〇〇元，高價二一三〇元，低價一九八〇元最後仍在二一〇〇元至二一五〇元間徘徊，結果較前收計甲乙微降二十元，丙種升五十元，丁戊兩者尚平。</p>
<h3>紗布人絲市場　明日起休業　新春初六開紅盤</h3>
<p>近日本市工商業，因農歷年關結賬關係，市塲交易，已漸趨停頓，即有市，進出亦極少，據聞自下週一起，如紗，布，人絲，棉花等谷市塲，均已通告休業，至各業新春紅盤，本年須延至本月二十七號（農曆正月初六日）開做，因新正初五，適値星期日。</p>
<h3>年關食油需要　中植儘量配售</h3>
<p>吳市長爲解決本市年關食油需要，昨晨特召見國營中國植物油料廠經理李廷棟，廠長張德成，囑令負責年關本市食油供應量，該廠已允予維持，惟提出要求二項，（一）電力供應，要求寬放，以期增加生產，（二）運用資金，請予籌墊，吳市長已允設法，據李經理語記者，本市年關食油供應無虞匱乏，該廠將盡量配售云。</p>
<h3>捲烟漲勢蓬勃　增高三分之一</h3>
<p>年關密邇，轉瞬兩大過去，即爲新春廢曆元旦，捲烟銷路因各地幫販去路旺盛，與本地小囤戶吸收，至昨晨起一步千里，飛漲達三分之一，實爲歷來罕有現象。大英烟最高，大盤一度開至二百廿萬，英美捲烟亦大漲特漲，零售小店與攤版，莫不改易標籤，重劃售價，如廿支白錫包原售二千五百元，昨日午後即售三千五百元一包，十支老刀原售三百至三百五十元，昨竟喊售四百至四百五十元，聽頭貨更屬俏利，此均屬於廢曆新年將屆，工商準備休假，零售商阪乘機抬價，故掀漲風，以圖漁利。據業中人稱：烟廠生產攤擠，此種現象，一過年頭五天，必將回跌云云。</p>
<h3>銀行外幣存款賬戶　不得支取外幣</h3>
<p>記者頃向中央銀行外匯審核處探悉：該處爲加强管理外匯起見，日前特通知各指定經營外匯銀行，嗣後對於外幣存款賬戶，不得支取外幣，並不得彼此劃撥，又外幣賬戶存款，提取情形，並得隨時報告外匯審核處云。</p>
<h3>進出口同業公會　設立小組委會　央行函釋結匯辦法</h3>

<p>又訊，中央銀行外匯審核處，為結匯及信用狀間題，昨函覆進出口同業公會，略謂：查進口商因罷運停航或其他困難，致貨物不能啓運，經由指定銀行向本處申請將購貨信用狀展期者，本處無不斟酌其實際情形，儘量寬限，用符發展國際貿易，扶植正當商業之旨。惟信用狀之展期，與輸入許可證之核發，係屬兩事，自不能因領有許可證，而謂其信用狀必可展期也。又信用狀之開給慣例不可變更，業經規定，並實行已久，目前似尚無變改之必要，至於結匯辦法，可參照太會通函規定之手續辦理云。</p>
<h3>呢羢市面停頓</h3>
<p>昨週六亦即舊臘月二十七日，呢羢市面，大半均皆停頓，除門市舖外，零躉交易絕無僅有，賣買雙方，多忙於軋頭寸，預備波過年關，迎接新春，紅盤開後再做生意。對於將來市面，見仁見智，各有不同。據業中人云：外匯如不更動，金價如得穩定，呢羢當無特殊升降。</p>
<h3>行莊頭寸鬆　年關可穩度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據金融界消息：農曆年關，已逼在眉睫。各銀行錢莊頭寸之調度，大致均已告一段落。爲穩健自身之實力計，各行莊對已放之款，無不積極收回，以備農曆新年開關後，另行計劃貸放。職是之故，日來金融業內頭寸，頗爲鬆動。昨日票據交換所交換結果，四行二局，尚軋解各行莊頭寸共達一百餘億元之多。故依近日趨勢觀之，金融業可望穩渡年關。惟一般工商界，除已於事前獲得當局之生產貸款者外，大多均感頭寸緊逼，此緣各行莊收回舊欠所致。開關後，頭寸即可望鬆動云。</p>

<h3>米市實銷轉暢　雜糧交易稀少</h3>
<p>米市南北共到四千八九百石，歲暮已臨，大戶小家均須備糧過年，是以實銷轉暢，店方納胃甚殷，形成求過於供，南北粳米續漲二千元，白元市勢定立，陰元則忽上忽落，見挺千元，秈米仍少做開，雜糧賣買稀寥，生油售戶不多，胃納亦不暢，淸油無軒輊，惟麻油則逐步下降，續跌四千元，豆餅客帮續動，再加一二百元，麩皮站立，麵粉仍難生色，依然平正，赤豆市化俏利，狂漲三四千元，茶豆穩定，生仁挺秀，花生帶緊，餘糧未開，今日正式收盤，自明日起，市塲休業，至一月二十七日星期一照常開市交易。</p>

<p>昨日紗市已成尾聲，客帮乘廉吸辦，引起買風，致廿支紗續升二萬至八萬，以重磅貨漲最足，因有華南帮動辦也。普通輕磅廿支紗亦升二三萬，內地客帮頗有吸收，細紗及雙綫無甚上落，人心穩定聞紗業各號頭寸，皆安排就緒，穩渡年關矣。</p>
<h3>食糖進出口絡繹</h3>
<p>洋糖亦有五萬包運到</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕食糖進口絡續不斷，由廣東台灣運來者外，今又有洋糖到埠，怡和公司經理之，都倫（譯昔）號，自溫哥華來滬，除運來大批木料外，又有洋糖五萬一千九百八十包，昨日傍晚抵滬，現泊公和祥碼頭起卸。又近日運往天津之食糖亦不少，招商局海漢輪，昨午北駛，計裝食糖三千二百餘，茶葉一百六十餘箱，疋頭五百九十餘件，棉紗一百八十餘件，運往天津。</p>
<h3>印度茶葉　徵收出口稅</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里十七日電〕當局昨夜宣佈：自即日起徵收茶葉出口稅每磅兩安那（一安那等於十六分之一盧比）。</p>
<h3>日繭價格尙不確定　運華稅待證實</h3>
<p>據中蠶公司負責人對記者稱：關於日繭運華一事，該公司於上週前曾接奉行政院電令，盟軍方面可以日繭一百萬磅運華，惟每磅價爲美金二元七角半，該公司當即以四百斤繅折合算，再加各項開支估計，繅成每磅生絲之成本，達美金八元餘，但以目下美市塲華絲最高價每磅僅値美金七元，當即由該公司還價每磅爲美金二元五角，迄今尚未獲得回電，盟軍總部方面，能否同意，尚難預料，外傳日繭即可運華，尚待證實。</p>
<h3>肥皂再創新高價　日用品多已升騰</h3>
<p>日來各業，已因除夕將至，而頻於停市，肥皂日用品，厥爲最鬧熱之交易，固本肥皂，昨日午前，一度曾漲至每箱十二萬，零售每聯二千元，其他各牌，亦均因爭購而上升，午後稍回，今晨做價十萬〇五千元，剪刀十萬〇二千元，皂廠實貨，多以虧折過鉅，不肯放出，新廠盤須在一二星期後，方可開做，若干皂廠，業已年假停工，但亦有日夜趕製應市，以掉回原料者。日用各物，香烟，火柴，漲勢亦屬甚熾。南貨商業生涯鼎盛，布店將於一二日內封樹度歲。百貨食品商業，則多以年底前三日爲生意最繁之日，故精神抖擻，緊張萬分。若干時裝公司，則顯見淸冷，遇有主顧，必竭誠招徠。銀樓業人頭擠擠，應接不暇，若干銀樓，夜間照常營業，以滿足一般人之購金熱。</p>
<p>又訊，肥皂市價直綫上漲，據該業中人談：肥皂主要原料，如燒碱，純碱，本市存底枯薄，而外貨又因須待申請許可，方能進口，緩不濟急。卜內門洋行近雖已有千餘桶裝滬，惟許可證遲遲未發，故不能提出應市。二月前燒碱每桶尚祗六十萬元，刻已飛漲至三百萬元，牛油一項，本國產量不敷應用，戰前本須仰仗澳洲供給，茲亦無貨運到。故牛油每担之價格，亦自二月前之十萬元，遞漲至目前之二十萬元。椰子油情形，尚屬良好。然在一二月前，皂價平賤異常。廠家以高價之原料，製成肥皂後，賤價供售，虧蝕不貲，生產量遂普遍减少。茲者市價雖節節高漲，然以原料亦步漲甚烈，故生產結果，仍不能言利潤。且各廠廠盤價，亦不過市價八折之譜。據稱：現本市共有製皂同業四十餘家，業務範圍大小不一。前因受虧蝕影響，已有一部份同業停業，現存者亦大多縮小範圍。一般同業之開工率；約僅百分之五十。如全部開足，其產量足敷供應市面之需要。現聞該業正醞釀新廠盤，大致一二週內，可見分曉云。</p>
<h3>閩茶產銷前途　中央全力協助</h3>
<p>〔本報福州訊〕閩省茶葉向暢銷於國內外市塲，在國際貿易中佔極重要地位，近受外匯及運輸之影響，銷路停滯，去年本省茶商，虧折殊甚，同時因政府及晨民銀行未能及時舉放茶貸，茶晨因資金缺乏，產量銳减，且品質日下，向居閩省重要特產之茶葉，至此每况愈下，茲悉：經濟部近有卅六年度復興茶葉計劃之凖備，對於閩茶之產銷，製造方法，茶葉合作社之組織至表關切，將就資金及技術上協助閩茶之發展，以促進輸出貿易云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：四聯總處生產事業貸款臨時審核委員會，自開始工作以來，迄已核發貸款總額共達四百卅餘億元，獲得貸款廠務，的在二百家左右云。</p>
<h3>汽油供應　仍未正常</h3>
<p>本市汽油供應，因三大汽油公司之運船油尚未辦妥進口手續，被江海關禁止進口，以致發生汽油恐慌，截至昨日爲止，猶未好轉，中區若干加油站曾發生排隊加油情事，每車加油量暫以三加侖爲限，計價五千九百元，據亞細亞火油公司消息，進口手續日內即可辦妥，故此種現象，不久定可解決，至於外傳汽油售價即將提高一說，該公司已予否認。</p>
<h3>中央銀行將組織　絲織業輸出委會</h3>

<h3>本市麵粉廠　生產量大减</h3>
<p>本市麵粉廠，於近數月來，僅福新，早豐，華豐，　新，阜通等五大廠，照常工作，其餘小廠均在暫時停工狀態中，昨悉：本市全部麵粉生產量，去年十月份達一·二一三•六四〇袋，十一月減至四九四·三一〇袋，十二月（即上月）則又减至二一四•四九七袋，僅及十月份六分之一，至生產量减低之主要原因，由於下列數點，（一）小麥原料不敷，外洋小麥尚未運到，本麥成本高昂，致生產未能增加，（二）過去兩個月，由價格未調整，廠商難以獲利，减少生產，（三）受電力限制影響，基於上述原因，致生產量每月减少，惟最近麵粉議價，已由二萬元提高至二萬五千元，各廠均已在準備增加生產，逆料陰曆新年以後，產量當可增加云。</p>
<h3>茶市每況愈下</h3>
<p>邇來茶市：旣因臘鼓頻催，復以若干家出口行對於年內付裝法屬非洲一帶之抽珍珍眉等綠茶，尚在急趕中，是以問津之意，一瀉千丈，交易每况愈下，趨勢尤見寂寞。頃據業中人云：刻下法商水興洋行，續有躉額華茶，正和積極向海外磋商，如能順利進行，俟渡過陰歷年關後，恐有相當出口，至於各式內銷茶，趨勢仍極鬆弛。</p>
<h3>美國汽車工業　希望撤銷管制</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十六日電〕美國汽車工業期望出口限制雖下能完全撤銷、亦應有所緩和，該業發言人指稱，爲競爭關外市塲，英國卡車及一貨車製造廠商正將其產量一半之客車及所產三分之一之商車輸出國外，並信法國製造廠商亦將其卡車產量百分之七十作爲輸出之用，一九四六年英國汽車工業出口之數字，頗爲有利，計有一三五•〇〇〇輛客車，一九〇•〇〇〇貨車，及若干其他商車，運銷國外市塲，惟因政府管制，生產商無法將其卡車及貨車按其產額之比例作爲轍出，此種管制限制客車出口爲百分之六·三，而貨車輸出則以佔年產額百分之二〇·四爲限云。查美國製造之車輛運往海外者最高數量曾爲客車四五一•〇九五輛，貨車白八二•六六七輛云。</p>
<h3>中國銀行發表　去年僑匯總數　金額日見減少　原因端在匯率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行國外部僑匯組，已於昨日將去年一月份至十二月份之僑匯數字結出，列表如下：月份金額（國幣元）</p>
<p>一月　八七、二七三、二九八</p>
<p>二月　四二、六一一、二一七</p>
<p>三月　四、七四八、四九〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>四月　八、六一九、六〇九、九三〇</p>
<p>五月　六、七二、七六三、四五六</p>
<p>六月　五、七九〇、三三四、八三九</p>
<p>七月　四、〇六一、七二〇、二六一</p>
<p>八月　八、三〇〇、六一五</p>
<p>九月　七、二九一、一〇七、二三四</p>
<p>十月　七、二二、五〇一、二四二</p>
<p>十一月　四、七〇三、一一〇、〇一五</p>
<p>十二月　三、六七八、四四二</p>
<p>上表二一兩月份，因外匯官價未定，仍照以前二十元價計算，故表面數字甚小，如將補助全數量計入，應照原有數字，另加二十四倍計算。三月份起，二〇二〇新匯率公佈後，僑匯數字激增，至四月而達最高峯。四月份以後，又漸减，至八月份，匯率改爲三三五〇，數字又稍增加。八月份以後，匯率無變動，而美鈔黑布日俏，故僑匯數字，每月遞减，至十二月份竟降至三十六億餘元，如以美金計算，則十二月份與四月份間差額，竟超過三倍以上。據中行國外某負責人稱：此項驚人差額，蓋由逃避僑匯而一起。按照以往，僑匯數字而言，每月數字，不應有鉅大差額，而十二月份數字，往往較以前數月爲大，此番十二月份數字最小，且較以前數月相差遠甚，實堪注意。中國銀行曾檢討本身業務，據調查結果，中行辦理僑匯，在速率上，決不遜於外商銀行，故逃避僑匯原因，端爲美鈔官價與黑市間之鉅大差額。華僑匯款，多向香港集中，譬如中國銀行仰光分行，原係爲辦理僑匯而設立，但近月以來，該分行生意淸淡，形同虛設，目前我方已派大員赴港，切實調查此事，調查結果，不久常可明悉云。</p>

<p>女組登場</p>
<p>首塲女子組强華逢靑聯，靑聯孫鳳竹負傷參戰，故威力减少，强華演出頗爲卯上，首節靑聯僅以五比四佔先一分，第二節强華曹曼麗，屢有所獲，曾造成十平之局，後靑聯孫鳳竹，柳惠珊分頭建功，前半時始以十六比十佔先。休息過後，靑聯猖獗異常，小妹妹徐佩珍，孫鳳竹打來得心應手，強華究以經騐關係一落後，第三節乃以十七比廿六，屈居下風，末節雙方聲嘶力盡，所獲無幾，結果靑聯以卅二比廿二，旗開得勝。</p>
<p>胖子獲勝</p>
<p>次幕戰華陽甲戰培爾，一連年青力壯，生龍活虎，一邊大腹便便，有若泰山，戰來甚爲精彩，胖先生多以遠射空心籃得分，笛聲響後三分鐘，雙方各無所獲，華陽孫銘新，董忠義，方於中綫遠射鵠中，以四比〇領先，培爾沈被章連擲帶罰，胡惠昭四决竄入建功，胡惠凱奮起直追，奈華陽董忠義空心籃絕妙，前半時終，以十五比十八落後一球半。休息再戰，華陽董忠義首中二球，培爾沈被章奪回四分雙方混戰多時，華陽陳紹庭五决犯規畢業，培爾得機緊攻，造成廿四比廿五僅一分之差。迨胡惠昭，胡惠凱昆仲，相繼犯規出塲，聲勢爲之一挫，最後四分鐘時，遂以廿八比廿四落後。華陽以爲時不久，大傳其球，時間旣屆，胖隊以廿八比廿七，一分壓倒培爾。</p>

<p>壓軸大戰，華聯戰春茂，前者上屆盟主，後者係華南全班人馬，故戰來頗為精彩。唐寶堃接得中綫來球，反身送前，任相成飛身順勢托人，繼而寳堃遠射中的，四比〇華聯先聲奪人，春茂忙呼暫停，計議反攻，李賢政首建奇功，黃天烈二罰中的，劉善福遠功得手，八分鐘時春茂遂以八比五後來居上，華聯情急，包松圓，陳學崇述袂進攻，迎連中的，春茂曾三次呼暫停，前半時終以十二比十四，落後華聯一球。</p>
<p>華聯受挫</p>
<p>易陣再戰，春茂攻勢突緊，李賢政一托一罰，阿彪繼而得分，華聯包松圓雖扳回一城，劉善福。二擲一罰，春茂卒以廿二比十六，再度領前。華聯小張心猿意馬，兩次罰球俱未獲中，迨最後四分鐘時，華聯以廿七比三二落後。華聯沉着應戰，小張罰進，繼遠射建功，任相成再罰得點，僅以卅一比卅三落後一球，包松圓二罰中一，仍落後一分。情勢緊張已極，李震中塲外，緊縐眉頭，莫可穿何。包松圓再度托入，張良雄遠射建功，華聯苦戰，又佔先着，然春茂何涵夫，三元連中，天下遂定，張良雄遠射獲中，無補大局卅九比卅八，菴聯一分受挫。</p>

<h3>砂糖與殺蟲劑　台中最高度的生產紀錄</h3>
<p>— 本報駐台記者揚育</p>
<p>四日航訊</p>
<p>一部糖業史，足以寫盡了台灣的滄桑，這作爲台灣乃至　東最大的企業，已經在海島上有三百多年的歷史了。從荷蘭佔領台灣，經過鄭成功及淸代的統治與日本人的壓榨以迄於今日的光復，它始終使海島擁着它，在遠東的經濟上，站了一個非常重要的位置。</p>
<p>在日本人施行殖民地經營下的台灣糖業，被視爲極重要的一環利潤所在，下惜動用了全部力量依照派往世界各國調查糖業歸來的新渡戶博士的建議，對糖業致力改進，許多舊式的糖坊工塲在這個洪流裏多被犧牲了，代而起之的便是日本人在台灣的九個大規模壟斷糖業的公司，用新式的機械，創造了台灣糖業最高度的生產記錄。</p>
<p>糖業垂危苦難重重</p>
<p>經過一塲空前的戰爭，台灣的糖業也急劇地轉了一個角度，光復以後，資源委員會與長官公署合辦的糖業公司，從日本人的手中，接收了許多瘡痍滿目的工廠，到目前爲止，已有三十七個，其中有的已經修復開工，有的則因受損過重，還需要整頓一個時期才能開工，資源委員會錢委員長昌照，最近來台曾在參議會裏演講他說三十六年度製糖額可增至十萬噸，三年後陸續增加產量至一百萬噸。這在工廠本身說，似乎達到這個目標並非不可能，只是放眼看一看大地，却有許多苦難攤現在眼前。</p>
<p>日本統治時代，一切唯自國的利益是圖。不擇手段，台灣的糖業有如他們的生命源泉，握得一點也不放鬆，他們强迫農民種蔗，統制了米穀的價格，使它和甘蔗的代價相同，說得好聽點，一面是獎勵植蔗，一面保障價格，同眸還把食料和肥料以低廉的配給作誘餌，在這種雙管齊下的政策下，當然會獲致相當的結果，可是現在的農民却要這樣打算盤了：日本人在戰時徵去了這裏的人力和糧食，爲了要吃飽肚子，就不得不多種一點稱，何况甘蔗要十八個月才能收獲一次，而種稻一年可收二次乃至三决，閒空的時候還可以種些豆麥雜糧。在地主方面也是這樣想，現在政府似乎還有一個釜底抽薪的辦法，肥料—台灣土地的主要食糧，還下能趕快解決，雖然從善後救濟分署運來二十萬噸肥料中，糖業分到了五萬噸，可是質地不同，數量也不够，分配起來是有很大困難。</p>
<p>農貸雖在舉辦，每年六期，但直到第四期時，才勉強能付出第一期的款子，台糖公司的款子是向台灣銀行取的，可是預算要六萬萬元的台幣超過了台的發行額，這在經費上也是頗成問題的。</p>
<p>征實，對蔗農也是一個大威脅，他們要用很高的代價去另外買食米來完納。也無怪這些苦難迫得他們天天在呌怨訴苦。</p>
<p>每日產量兩千餘担</p>
<p>台中糖廠，是屬於台南虎尾台糖第一分公司的一個土廠，它的前身是「帝國製糖株式會社」，這個字樣在高聳入雲的大烟囱上，已被剝蝕得幾乎沒有法子可以辨別出來了，戰爭中這裏吃了三個炸彈，好得沒有炸在要處，所以今年五月一日正式接收過來以後，酒糖工塲就很快的修復了。至於製糖工塲因爲離開明年二月的開工期還遠，現在正在逐部淸理機器管子裏凝結住的糖渣，千百根管子要一根根拆下來檢查，這乎續是够麻煩的，該廠趙振堯跺長告訴記者，職工四百五十多人，現在多在廠中，一到甘蔗收穫開工，馬上就可以發揮最高的製糖效力，不過現在不是技術上的問題。最大原因還是農民不肯種蔗和肥料缺乏，拿民國卅四至卅五年的產量來說，合中糖廠的農塲，原料區的面積只有一萬三千七百餘畝（本來農塲，蔗作遍地，原料區一共有近四十五萬畝的面積，可是戰爭末期也給這裏帶來了厄運）產糖每甲約六萬斤，現在雖說已有三萬畝左右的田地，但甘蔗却瘦得可憐，往年可以製四個月的糖，現在只怕連一個月也製不滿，至於產量能否及得上以前一萬三千多畝的產量，還是一個疑問呢！</p>
<p>工塲的設備相當完善，機械的壓榨甘蔗能力，每日的一千五百噸，每天可產砂糖二千多擔。這樣看來，政府似乎應該趕快想一個對策要使田地裏的甘蔗不辜負這些高度的機械能力才好。</p>
<p>三種砂糖手續紛繁</p>
<p>雖然還沒有開工，但記者仍被領導着在修理中的工塲作了一次巡迴，並承他們告訴了我一步步的製糖手續，甘蔗收穫後，可以用廠營的火車自農場直運至工過磅後即以卸荷機卸裝於甘蔗運送機工，運送機的頂部有二組滾動刀，可以把甘蔗切斷，然後經壓碎後輸入匯榨機，經四組壓榨機壓榨，所得的蔗渣送至鍋爐室作燃料，一部份經壓裝後可以供製造紙漿，現在台灣人家庭中的天花板什九多是這種紙漿所做的蔗板。所得蔗汁，便用喞筒輸入加然器將溫度加至華氏七五—八〇度，而後放入亞硫酸作用槽並以十二度BX（Brix濃度）石灰水，及百分之七—八的二氧化硫同時通入，使蔗汁中的雜質及含色物除去，於是再送入加熱器加熱至華氏一〇五度後，在沉澱槽內使其雜質沈澱分離，這樣要經過兩次沈澱及篩濾，再將濾泥經壓濾器壓濾所得的濾餅，含有多量鈣磷及有機物，可以輸至農塲作肥料，所得十五度BX的澄淸汁即用喞筒送入有四重效用的蒸發器得到了五〇度BX的原料糖槳，再於糖漿亞硫酸器內通以二氧化硫再度漂白後，輸入眞空鍋內熬濃結晶品得九十四度BX的糖膏放入助晶器內使其充份結晶後，經糖膏拌和器，入分　　，醫　輿糖　分離，這時候所製成的　，就　爲一號砂糖，經過乾燥　之乾燥而包裝成製成品，至糖　約有八度〇BX，再經眞空　取熬濃至九十四度BX，使其結日經分　機而得二號砂糖及二號糖　，再經熬濃得至九十六度BX的結晶而成三號砂糖，所餘的三號糖實就可以用來製造酒精與酵母。</p>
<p>吃糖的人在嘴裏甜了一下就完了，可是有誰知道它的產生是有着這樣許多煩重的手續？</p>
<p>「滴了死」殺虫新劑</p>
<p>「滴了死」殺虫劑，是採自台灣特產的蒂利斯根中（DerrisBeuth），它的自然分布地是安南，暹羅，馬來等地，過去在馬來有這樣一句俗諺：「無Tuba即無野菜。」（Tuba即蒂利）可見蒂利斯的殺虫效力是早已被發掘了的，台中糖廠以前用來殺滅甘蔗的害虫，曾擁有四〇八甲的蒂利斯農塲，現在更製造溶液，稱爲「滴了死」的一種普遍殺虫　，「滴了死」中最王要的成份是毒性極强的羅提晨（Rotenou），百萬倍的溶液就可以毒死一條三尺多長的大鯉魚。以</p>
<p>蒂利期中可以提出蒂利斯精，那具有更可怕的毒性，以前亦曾由這裏製出後行銷至美國。</p>
<p>這　蒂利斯植物，種　在台中糖廠的農塲裏，平均一甲（十五畝）可收穫達二千斤左右，但是三年才能收穫一次來利用它含有足量的羅提農，因此人工相當昂貴，民間也有種植，台中糖廠每年也從他們手中以十五元一斤的代價加以搜羅。</p>
<p>製造「滴了死」的工塲中，有如下的機械設備：截斷機五具，空氣加熱裝置一具，熱氣乾燥一座，粉碎機四架，篩機二具，混合機架，蒸氣罐一具，製造的程序很簡單，我在那裏僅化費了半小時，就看到了它的成品，道裹每天能造五百多斤。</p>
<p>把蒂利斯粉混和了肥皂水，藥性更可耐久，台南州農會曾加以試騐，獲致了滿意的結果，有人將這種藥品帶到上海加以試騐，也證明殺虫力超過DDT這種道地的優良的國產殺虫劑，是很値得向國人介紹推薦的。</p>
<h3>河北教育現狀</h3>
<p>— 本報記者楊炳森</p>
<p>保定一月二日訊</p>
<p>記者日前訪冀省府敎育廳長賀翊新氏，詢以冀省敎育概况承不辭煩瑣，就河北敎育情形縱橫長談，經記者詳細記錄，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，本省敎育的可分爲四個階段：第一，抗戰發生後一年中間，本省原有敎育事業，遭日敵摧殘，可謂破壞時期。第二，從二十七年九月省政府回到河北，至廿九年一月，各項敎育，又能在省境內開展推進，可謂進展時期。第三，從二十九年二月以後，省敎育廳，寄居磷省工作，多偏重救濟方面，可謂救濟時期。第四，自卅二年以後至敵人投降，則注重復員工作準備，可謂復員準備時期。</p>
<p>進展路綫</p>
<p>日本在投降以前，敗勢以定，本省敎育復員工作，已開始進行，三十二年曾舉辦敎育復員人才登記，復員後之一年內，總計接收及恢復的學校，高等敎育有專科以上學校六校，公私立高初中等學校四十四，省縣立師範及簡師三十三，省立小學及幼稚園十四，省縣民衆敎育館二十九處，巡廻教學團四隊，學校數目較抗戰前，相差懸殊，學校設備和學生課業，亦遠不如戰前，因爲本省各縣，大部爲共黨盤據，戰火迄未停止，鐵路破壞，交通梗阻，推行敎育特別困難，但本省仍努力排除萬難，其主要工作：（一）加强學校訓導工作，各學校一律實行導師制，注重學生生活訓練和精神訓練，指導學生思想，糾正偏激觀念，幷實施軍事訓練將抗戰後中央新頒佈之各種訓導法規，印發各學校遵照辦理，敎育廳幷派視察員隨時隨地督導改善。（二）改訂課程實行甄審：冀省淪陷八年，各校課程，皆下合於中央規定，教材內容，更多違背三民主義精神，冀應接收各學校後，即督促各校加緊補習三民主義課程，無論在校學生或畢業生一律參加甄審。（三）救濟各校貧苦靑年；各校凡是家在匪區的學生，大多失掉救濟，省府即設法籌撥食糧，每人每月配發雜糧五十市斤，本年又請中央，撥款救濟之學生達七百五十人，暑期中幷舉辦夏令營三處，訓練學生達三千人。（四）推行國民敎育：凡政權所達到縣份，積極籌設國民學校據最近統計：中心國民學校已有三四八校，國民學校二三一八校，此外幷審查中等學校公民敎員及訓導人員資格，發動各界辦理民衆學校等各項敎育急務工作。</p>
<p>今後方針</p>
<p>今後冀省敎育方針首要配合黨政軍各部門之需要，繼續完成復員工作，惟目下因省政權向未順利開展，計劃逐漸隨治安圈之擴展，將全省各縣教育發達起來，澈底剷除一切反動勢力和敎育躍進中的障礙，在全國統一的敎育制度下，全力推進。其次即提高國民知識水準，冀省民衆抗戰後遭日寇及共軍蹂躪，知識貧乏，生活低落，殊爲國民之最大危機，以是目前特着重於國民教育，及生計敎育之發展，期使人民知識水準及生活水準提高，始克談到鄉村自治，鄉村建設。此外，再配合國家建設計劃，造就各項人材，我們的領袖在「中國之命運」一書中，擬定我國戰後十年建設計劃，需要各項技術人材達二百四十六萬多人，本省當配合此點，造就各項需要人材，完成我國偉大建設目的。還有我們河北人要發揚河北精神，燕趙多慷慨悲歌之士，具有用健質樸，重然諾，分辨邪正等特殊精神，歷史上的藺相如，楊椒山，孫承宗，顏習齋，都是河北的先賢，可以作我們的代表人物。</p>
<p>但河北淪陷後，人民普遍感受了敵奸的奴化和惡化敎育，民族正義和燕趙精神已漸消沉，現在要以敎育的力量加以發揮，務期每個學校成爲民族的堡壘，每個敎師都成爲民族的導師，每個學生成爲民族的鬥士，每個社會和每個集團，成爲民族的熔爐，如此河北才有希望，國家才能復興</p>
<h3>大地主負債累累　「丁半城」自殺</h3>
<p>濰縣的電炬，遠較濟南爲明亮。路燈照耀，如同白畫。幾條比較寬闊的街上，行人熙熙攘攘，尚　　蘭。織布業，水菓業，在這裏比較最繁榮發達。但據明瞭內情的人們告訴記者，情形也委實一年不如一年。號稱濰縣首富的丁叔言，於去年除夕因負債過重而服毒自殺，就是一最明顯的例證。</p>
<p>原來在戰前，丁叔言的地產本來逾萬頃，素有「丁半城」之稱。丁爲人生性磊落，豪俠仗義，詩詞字畫，俱臻上乘。靑年時曾遠遊東華，與胡適之。傳斯年等酬唱交遊，及壯，又獲選爲響省代表，周旋政壇。抗戰軍興後，參加游擊部隊，捐餉助糧，不遺餘力。及勝利後，因戰亂未已，負債債累累達四億元，日需付息百餘萬，雖尚擁有房產三四百處，地產五千餘畝，然因租收無着，變賣無方，終於除夕之夜，吞服雅片烟膏四兩自殺。識者謂：這不僅是丁氏個人的悲哀，同時也正是濰縣工商界及金融界形將陷入總崩潰的一個預兆。春節瞬將到臨，更不知有若干企業將隨着丁氏去世而陷入危機！</p>
<h3>膠濟路全綫行（二）　濰縣去來</h3>
<p>— 山東特派員麗天</p>
<p>本報十一日航訊</p>
<p>濰縣是魯東絕無僅有未被共軍解放的城池。從外表上，它幾乎還完全保留住純內地風光。由車站至進城的街道兩旁所排列著的平房中有許多是茅房，若干小客棧還都貼著紅紙字招在招攬著過往的旅客。尙沒有完全拓寬的街道所鋪的長方石板，由於年久失修，坎坷不平，使所有行旅和車輛於通過時倍感疲憊和艱辛。記者因下車時已在下午四時以後，時間上不允許對街頭景色多所瀏覽，而不得不匆促問首先拜會着此間最高軍事當局夏總司令楚中中將。</p>
<p>當記者抵達總部時，夏將軍適因事外出，乃先由唐參謀長孟壑代爲接談。唐於民國廿八年前後曾任長沙警察局局長，與記者原係舊識，我們首先交換了彼此別後的情况，繼續下來，他就告訴我，共軍內部的許多實際情形，共軍統治下民衆的困苦情形，共軍內的砲手全部及機關槍手一部皆爲日俘，共軍中並有××籍顧問，在去年十一月萊州之戰中我們就發現有許多日俘的屍體。</p>
<p>夏楚中將軍論乾塘取魚</p>
<p>談約半時，夏德司令回來了！這位一別五載以參加淞滬抗戰，一二三次長沙會戰及襄佐王佐民將軍完成湘西大捷的夏楚中將軍。所給記者的第一個印象，就是他較過去豐腴得多了。他帶着湖南鄉音首先詢問記者對於國是的看法，記者自然毫無疑問的答以「政治第一」。他對這點認爲全部同意，但他認爲中國今天的問題，仍是「三分軍事，七分政治」。繼續下來，他告訴記者：「共軍在軍事方面，是避免打硬仗，你來我往，你去我來，慣施襲擊，非佔得以衆出寡的優勢，有十足的把握，絕不輕舉妄動，所以我們的駐防部隊，偶一不愼，便會吃虧。在政治方面，他們每一個村莊都潛伏着少數中堅幹部，企圖達其配合軍事的要求。對於這，夏將軍的具體辦法是：國軍打共軍正規部隊是有絕對把握的，跟着就應該針對共軍的三種戰術，予以澈底的打擊。共軍好比魚，民衆乃是水，要捕盡魚蝦，最好是抽乾儲水，爭取民衆，組織民衆，使他不得藏身，等於乾塘取魚。我們在軍事開呢之餘，必須更注意政治，以對共黨之政治，共黨有救農會，我便組織救　　，來對付他。還鄉隊旣已還鄉，便失去了作用，必須運用這個　資，以一人聯結五人，再聯而爲廿五　。再聯而爲一百廿五人，集結起來，便成爲一個永遠安定的力量，這個力量，才是人民最基本的力量。」</p>
<p>夏將軍很健談，他滔滔不絕地提出一個結論，就是在收復　　該盡量多組織歸誠隊，開彼自新，避免斬殺。</p>

<h3>民事訴訟補充條件　第十二條影響社會論</h3>
<p>— 力羣</p>
<p>近因民事訴訟補充條例第十二條，有依原有效果顯失公平者法院應公平裁量爲增减給付等云之文，四行存款，有千倍還本之判例，使整個社會，人心惶惶，不能安定。滬上金融家法家經濟學者及名流政客，曾在某報談座發表意見，除稍涉偏見武斷者外，其平心討論者，大都本財政上法律上及銀行業務上之見地爲言，祗某君有關係農民之言而已。其實關係整個社會甚鉅，豈唯農民，而議者咸未能深察討論及此，誠足異也。</p>
<p>今之論者，莫不首及國債，私債千倍，國亦宜然。今國家雖窮，增一開支，固無大影響，不過使人民增些負擔已耳，是使不持有債票人爲持有人盡義務也，豈曰公允，又法幣鈔票，亦國家之債務，設人民藏有戰前之紙幣或關金券等，要求加倍調換近年之鈔票，可乎不可？</p>
<p>夫加倍還舊債之理由，以昔日物價低而今日漲也，若定戰前者應加，而戰後第一年，（即廿七年），物價反跌，至廿八年稍漲，以後逐年增長，十倍，數十倍，百倍，千倍，甚至數千倍，至敵人投降前夕而極矣，故必及於戰後歷年方爲公平，可無疑也。今欲照值效果以求公平，則必按物值之一種，依其年年之物價而計算之，則時間久吾物價多少之問，差別甚繁，而尤以銀行爲甚，彼其歷年之進出，不知其幾，歷年揭算將一併推翻，加還他人與向人增索，將多至不可理論，且勝利至今，物價又高漲不少矣，是否亦須照加，今日之倍貸，至明年如有上下，是否亦須按物計算，如物價見跌，是否可以减折還本，如曰今法爲舊債而設，以後一概不問，則是前者問效果而後者可不問，則其所謂公平者何在？若亦照物而計，則將陷於無窮之失。夫借貸無論今昔，其本位固是法幣而非物品，而還償則必按物値效果而不問本位，吾則法律必曰依其效果顯失公平，其擾亂金融爲何如耶？</p>
<p>夫銀行業務，隨存隨放，取些利潤而已，今一旦還人千倍，豈是適當，且銀行中亦有能力薄弱者，更將引起倒閉之事，則又牽動金融矣。</p>
<p>雖然，國債也，以國家之大，當然無問</p>
<p>題，銀行存款也，有銀行之富，</p>
<p>即使加倍還償，即使手續麻煩，除少數力薄小銀行外，似亦均可勉强應付，獨普通人民之間，關係整個社會之擾攘，乃足為深患也，而論者均不及此，可怪也歟！</p>
<p>尤其鄉村農民，關係至切，被其對像之債權，往往爲地方之士劣，如果加倍之律例具在，雖云法院可以量情出入，而加倍之風聲所及，欲壓迫良善者，則有辭矣，而窮而無告者，固將順受而奚說，行見小小數百元舊債，將見牽繫其牛羊收沒其田廬矣，故立法不可不愼也，又不獨農民爲然也。</p>
<p>今夫立足於社會之人，孰不有其債權與債務，國家當戰前美國收購白銀政策後，銀根極緊，致全國大不景氣工商業之淸理與夫私人日用之負債，不知其幾，復經敵國侵入之兵災。八年抗戰以來，物價高漲之壓迫，苟非爲大漢奸或通敵之大囤積家發國難財者，其平常安分人民，鮮不如水益深，如火益熱，坐吃山空，日益增其債量。即有稍能營工商，或略有技術可致用，或尚有剩餘之薄產，而小小境界，亦不過可以生活焉而已。國變以來，社會上此種人甚多數，謂其窮耶，尚能生活，或尚有地位，或且尚有薄產，謂其有耶，生活極爲勉強，此種人已最多，而不如彼者更多數，在債權人以幣値之低也，存可得可失之心，不欲加以逼迫，而債務人則反力圖節衣縮食，以爲淸償之備，蓋凡人而不至於無辦法，則未有不爲立身廉恥計也。雙方本可以和平誠懇之姿態而了結之，今也忽有加倍之律例，則債權者因倍數變微小爲鉅大之故，孰不欲興訟素逼，以獲此大宗之財利，將不惜殫精敝神以赴之，而舊欠之人豈能勝任，卒之訟逼之後，實際所獲，亦至有限，而所得者，亦不過一鉅大之空頭支票耳。在債務方面，本可以顧廉恥，圖了結，今突遭倍數訟累之橫加，則必封房屋拍傢具而不足，則必宣告破產，使老母愛妻失於養，雅子弱息失於學，廉恥名譽永不可復，慘何如也耶！使負債者，非因加倍而遭此境遇，雖慘矣，亦宜也。今法不加倍，本來無事，因法加倍而有此慘事，則立法者之過也。法律欲惜舊債權矣，而徒使敝神興訟所得無幾，懲舊欠人矣，而百倍千倍之而必使至於破產，至於家破人散，又何其忍也。夫其昔日之負債也，本不得已也。旣非是借款以囤貨，而法律竟以物値効果囤貨漲價之眼光目之，豈不過哉，且舊日爲債務人而同時稍有債權者有之，爲債權人而同時稍負債務者亦有之，於是乎在此法例之下，將到處爭訟索迫，本均可已而此時一牽百動，均不可已，則倍數激之也。行見整個社會紛擾不已矣，譬如靜水之中，忽投以巨彈，激浪浸溢，使旋渦中大小舟艇互相擊觸，卒之大者傷，而小者覆沒也。噫！　　亦太甚矣，諺曰：「天下本無事，庸人自擾之」，其斯之謂乎！</p>
<p>夫爲政教於國者，以安定民生爲上計，未聞以激擾民生爲得計者也。以敎民息爭崇讓，民風淳厚為根本，未聞者導之使爭訟洶洶為事者也。況今各國政治，莫不趨重於社會民生，先聖有不患，寡而患不均之訓。故爲法於國者，與其使有者增益，何如使乏者得蘇，此乃不平之平也。</p>
<p>且民之多爭，於國匪祥，余少讀嚴澤「天演論」，有泯其爭於內而後勝其爭於外之言，嘆爲至理名言，故孝公强秦，人民怯於私蘭，勇於公戰，周文興仁，虞田息訟讓畔，雖王霸之術不同，欲使民息爭於內而努力從公，一也。方今國家百端待興，須賴人民一心一德，羣策羣力以赴之。奈何多定法條激亂人心乎？傳曰：「聽訟，猶吾人也，必也使無訟乎」，方今法律民事有調解之庭本爲减訟息爭也，意至善焉。奈何今於此民事訴訟補充條例中，增此特然越出倫類之第十二條文，雖　意在公平，而不知反以激厲民間之爭訟，使整個社會爲之不安也，此眞立法者千盧之一大失也。雖司法界有時可以量情載斷而輕重之，然根本法律如此，則人民因此之爭訟，自不能已，將見此亦一是非，彼亦一是非，情萬不同，而判例下勝其判例，亦終難合乎物值効果之平，蓋其所謂効果之依據，實蔑視法幣本位而動搖之，變爲物値之隨時，幣耶物耶，人民無所適從。噫，哀哀窮黎，將訟不勝訟，擾不勝擾矣！故欲挽救斯失，非司法界多造判例所能，惟有立法院將該第十二條文加以撤消，庶法帶自法幣，物值自物値，劃然條然而不混爲一談，則此等可已不已之爭訟自息，而不致增加社會之不寗矣。</p>
<p>近聞有建議最高當局擬修改法例爲增加複利者，斯於法幣地位不致動搖矣，但其所謂複利仍須合百倍數百倍以償，此爲整個社會不安影響，仍同上論。蓋一般人民之債務，往往因戰前不景氣與戰事以來生活高漲之壓迫，及今未蘇，焉能任此，明知不能勝任而强之，此亂之道也。至現存銀行能力較强，勝任與吾，則爲另一問題，非本論之重點。</p>
<p>余因論者觀點偏重銀行等等，無有顧及全社會紛擾之害者，故爲此論。（完）</p>

<h3>錦繡天堂特輯</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>「錦繡天堂」原名「齊格菲萬花筒」，是米高梅公司一九四五年八月份的出品。</p>
<p>米高梅公司的歌舞片，一貫有燦爛奪目的彩色，偉大新奇的佈景，「出水芙蓉」「璇宮琦夢」「平地靑雲」，無不如此，「錦繡夭堂」是更可期待的紅星大雜會。它的題材仍以美國哄動一時的齊格菲歌舞團的事略作爲中心，老闆佛朗滋，齊格菲一角依然由老牌明星威廉飽惠爾主演，這次是破例請其出山，以壯聲色，他是故金髮女郞琴哈羅的丈夫。片分十二幕短劇，歌舞滑稽，各由幾個大明星主演，拍攝費時三年，聘用攝影工作隊兩組，分拍道張綜合十七種和四十五景的個別塲面。另外請了七十五個女裁縫，爲各大明星及齊格菲女郞縫製華裝四百套。</p>
<p>演員俱屬米高梅的新興精說，薈萃一堂。舞王茀雷亞斯坦拔足助陣，主演「石灰屋的憂愁」，他於去年年底宣告退休，不再舞蹈，這次是僅賸的觀賞的機會，與他搭配的是米高梅新進舞星魯茜白蘭摩，她於一九四五年與茀雷合演五彩歌舞片「阿蘭達之賊」一片嶄露頭角，長相美艷，生活畫報特將其照片刋諸封面，且以全幅登載她的肥皂泡泡浴的照片，雀斑美人露茜鮑兒，「璇宮琦夢」的女主角，領銜此片Merry-Go-Round一塲的演出，露茜和一羣齊格菲女郞，騎着雪白俊馬輕歌熒舞，一片春色。「出水芙蓉」的浴裝美人伊漱慧蓮絲，在此有一塲新頴驚人的表演，穿着閃光的金銀色游泳衣，在水底跳巴蕾舞，花樣新鮮，眞是見所未見。巴蕾舞是人間最美妙的藝術，台上表演必須出神入化之鍛練，一到水底人被水力壓制，能作如此嬝娜之舞姿，說得上幻麗之極。「萬象歡騰」「七情花」「新栗娃栗姐」女主角凱薩玲葛蕾蓀，歌唱「美女」主題歌，她的歌喉另有風味，引人至深。米高梅的寵兒裘蒂迦綸，片中飾扮一個不勝記者探訪之煩的電影明星，她是美國近數年來十大賣座明星之一，始終不渝，有人担憂她長成少婦以後，歌舞沒有前途，「合家歡」却有好成績。「萬象歡騰」男角琪恩凱萊亦有精彩演出，他外貌的吸力在「聖誕節」中早有定評，舞藝從「封面女郞」「璇宮綺夢中可見一斑，茀雷亞斯坦退隱，喬治茂翻保守沉默的結果，琪恩凱萊便是覇主。「星光四射」裏的老瘟生維多摩亞，老牌反派明星愛德華亞諾和新興丑角雷史基爾分別串演滑稽劇。南美名歌手李娜馨，斐名美州，她的皮膚微黑，腔調與卡門密蘭黛却又不同，獨唱「愛情」「麗莎」兩支，比較溫婉。主演最佳的一段笑劇「請報號碼」的基南魏恩，地是米高梅紅小生范喬生的好朋友，影城著名人物，他的滑稽素受美國人仕稱譽，米高梅對彼相當重視。</p>
<p>本片導演馮遜敏尼里，是裘蒂迦綸的新夫婿，在米高梅以至好萊塢的新進導演羣中他是最有建樹的一人。「合家歡」中，會散後一對小戀人挑燈私語，電車上的花團錦簇的歌唱會，一點一滴都藏有溫馨的記憶，我們的行過的生命。一九四五年佳片之一的「時鐘」，重返銀幕的羅勃泰勒和凱薩玲赫本的近作「潛流」，是其光榮的里程碑，他是很有希望的導演。</p>

<h3>關於齊格菲</h3>
<p>— 伯寗</p>
<p>齊格菲的故事即是百老匯的故事，因爲他的一生事蹟渲染成美國歌舞史上最輝煌的一頁。</p>
<p>齊格菲的時代正是美國最奢糜的時代。那是歌舞女郞僅憑美貌便能換得大量酬報的時代，也是鑽石大王曾用十克拉的大鑽石用作衣服紐扣的時代。齊格菲最不把金錢常作一回事，今天來，明天去，連眉兒也不皺一　的。當他某次事業失敗，虧折達二百萬元的時代，他也不過對他的愛妻淺下經心地說了一聲：「我又垮了！」</p>
<p>目前美國電影歌舞界中，尚有不少知名之士是齊格菲的舊人，喜劇人才如埃第康泰，威爾羅傑士，瑪麗琳密，莉費爾士等都是他一手造就的。又如戰前紅極一時的女星佛琪尼亞勃羅斯，也是一個，此外，還發掘了不少傾國傾城豔麗絕世的歌女舞星。</p>
<p>齊格菲是個溫文有禮，談吐爾雅的好好先生，天性善良，略帶些迷信色彩。他是第一個將眞善美灌注入歌劇中去的人物。美人兒因他的選拔鼓吹而抬高了身價，他的豪奢偉大的「齊格菲歌舞」無疑地巷美麗歌舞界造成了劃時代的最高峯。</p>
<p>他歌舞團中的歌舞女郞全是經他精選的，名爲「齊格菲女郞」。這是他每一齣歌劇的焦點，他想盡種種方法求其盡　盡美。至於故事結構倒非所重視。</p>
<p>齊格菲歌舞團從一九××年創辦以後，若干年間，傑作衆多，不知哄動了多少觀衆。他的「三劍客」「羅薩麗」「畫舫緣」三齣歌劇在百老匯同時上演的當兒，簡直風魔了全美的男女。</p>
<p>齊格菲極隨便（因此不常守的）。很少笑容，以致他的朋友與屬下都在背後喚他「冷面人」。然而却極好客而熱情，有時慷慨地一次倍給人家十萬美金，竟不問問保證如何。</p>
<p>他最喜歡打電話發電報。除了鑑賞美女以外，大的這是他傾心喜愛的一樁事情了。</p>
<p>齊格菲是死了，百老匯的盛名也逐漸被好十來塢取而代之，可是齊格菲這三字却並未被時代的浪潮所湮沒，甚且好萊塢的製片家也不能忘情，一而再，再而三地掇拾他的事蹟或者豪華富麗的作風攝製影片。齊格菲畢竟是百老匯的奠基石！</p>
<h3>沒有故事結構</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>「錦繡天堂」有個大胆的特色，沒有故事結構。這是一部銀幕上的音樂歌舞偉構，一個節目緊接另一個節目，塲面豪奢華麗，色彩美艷奪目，然而放棄了故事結構。</p>
<p>因爲當年齊格菲歌舞國的演出，最不重視這一點，「錦繡天堂」爲了表示對齊格菲的忠實，也放棄了這一點。</p>

<h3>不用牽綫栩栩如生的　新型傀儡戲</h3>
<p>— 佐溪</p>
<p>在「錦繡天堂」中，銀幕上第一次出現一羣動作活潑，栩栩如生，沒有綫牽的傀儡。這些八吋長的侏儒，表現出電影所特有的生動的畫面，賽如生人。</p>
<p>這便是蒲寗的最新型傀儡戲。</p>
<p>電影觀衆將重見昔日齊格菲歌舞明星舞踊於銀幕之上。這些傀儡用一種富有彈性的秘密質料製造，因此它們的動作酷肖生人。當傀儡笑的時候，甚至口角都能現出笑渦來。爲了要顯示這些微妙的效果，還種舞蹈鏡頭每天只能拍攝七呎影片，銀幕上歷時一分鐘的「大腿舞」，拍攝影片時需費十五天。六個傀儡的不同的動作，須用五百個傀儡來表演。</p>
<p>蒲寗這一套獨一無二的本領，是從巴黎藝術界學來的。他從著名藝術家鮑德爾學習彫刻，一九二四年曾在故鄉芝加哥舉行個人展覽會。在「從早晨到午夜」這一傀儡戲中，開始其傀儡牽綫人的生涯。他第一次表演酷肖生人的傀儡戲，是在紐約世界博覽會石油展覽會中的一張短片裏面。一九四三年，他加入米高梅影片公司，拍攝「錦繡天堂」，經過了十三個月的苦幹，用他的傀儡編成了一部昔日齊格菲歌舞明星的小史。其中有埃第康泰唱歌，威爾羅傑士舞動着繩圈。</p>
<p>服裝和人物同樣重要。蒲寗的傀儡所穿的衣服，都是仿照原來的齊格菲服式特別設計的。甚至她們的頭髮經過特殊的梳理，她們的眉毛每天得鬈曲一次！</p>
<h3>錦繡天堂　形形色色</h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>「錦繡天堂」自始至終就浸沉在熱鬧的氣氛中。此片中齊格菲已死去，在天堂中過着舒適的生活，這角色由威廉飽惠爾來飾演，其他滑稽明星雷史基爾頓，維多毛爾，凱耐惠恩來代替了舊時代的惠爾羅吉士，里昂埃洛爾等。</p>
<p>歌舞方面，現在是由「舞聖」茀雷亞斯坦担任三塲，兩塲的舞伴是新星露茜勃麗瑪，還有一塲是與琪恩凱萊的蹕躂舞。舞步新穎，服裝奇特。此外是依莎威蓮絲的游泳，裘蒂迦綸和凱塞玲葛萊蓀的歌唱，闋闋悅耳動聽，令人神往，再加上露茜鮑兒的舞劇。眞是爭研鬥艷，美不勝收。</p>
<h3>萬花筒中的燦爛銀星　錦繡天堂四個天使</h3>
<p>— 琪</p>
<p>（一）露茜白麗梅（Lucille　Bremer）生在紐約州的亞姆斯透達，在十二歲的時候，就開始在菲里德　　的歌舞團中表演。十六歲時在紐約的雷電華城音樂大應中很得盛名，遂被米高梅公司所賞識，她首决在銀幕上出現是在合眾歡中當裘蒂迦倫的大姊。最近她常和舞王茀雷亞斯坦合作，新作有「Volanda　and　the　Thief」。在錦繡天堂中，亦是舞王的舞伴，身長五呎四吋，重一百十一磅，紅的頭髮，蔚藍的眼睛，喜歡散步，游泳及看電影。</p>
<p>（二）伊漱蕙運絲現在是全世界美國兵所歡喜的一個甜姐兒了。她是加州人。當她還下能講話的時候，她母親就己把她放在海灘上，讓海浪衝擊着她的身體，所以她有今日的游泳成就，她曾想參加奧林匹克之游泳競賽，但是因爲世界大戰的爆發，使她下得不放棄道個計劃。一九四〇年，在高中畢業後，就在一個售運動衣服的商店當女職員。同年夏天，她遇到了米高梅公司的監製人，得蒙賞識而簽訂合同，第一張作品是鴛鴦戲水，出水芙蓉是她最受人歡迎的一片，現在的「錦繡天堂」中她再度表演永底巴蕾舞。</p>
<p>（三）裘蒂迦倫的父母，是在一個音樂隊中服務的。三歲時她的父親就呌她在合上表演，後來就不斷的和二個姊姊一同表演。小時她立志要做律師。某一年夏天，在某地歌唱時，被一個米高梅公司的天才發掘者所發現，因爲她的歌聲太好了。第二天她就和狄安娜竇萍在“Every　SundayAfternoon”中出現。以後她就一帆順風，先後曾和米蓋羅納在哈代家庭迎續片中合演，最近的作品有萬象歡騰，合家歡，藝人儷影等。</p>
<p>（四）凱塞琳葛雷遜年靑美麗，而且有着婉轉悅耳的歌喉。自與米高梅簽訂合同後，曾受過三年極嚴格的訓練，無論聲樂，表情，化粧，姿熊等等，無不曾努力學習，然後脫穎而出，第一片便任柏士德納克導演的「七情花」中主角，一鳴驚人。在」錦繡天堂」中壓軸主唱「美女」，隱的可見對她的重視。</p>

<h3>由吳昌碩說到齊白石</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>日前，畫人齊白石南下，挾其作品，舉行畫朕，藝術界曾因此轟動一時。許多報章刋物，都有評述齊的作品。而在評述中，多必和吳昌碩並論，說是南吳北齊。固然，在中國近代畫史，吳齊各有他的相當地位，但是他們兩人的造詣，是各有不同，猶之乎梁啓超興章士釗，周樹人與郭浗若，文章各有各的風格，各有他的面目，未可同等觀的。</p>
<p>容我先來談談吳昌碩詩畫篆刻，謝玉岑說吳的創造精神，是：「生當前淸末年，詩値同光閩贛派洶湧之時，畫當山陰鴛湖風靡一時之際，書後安吳儀徵，刻印後西泠八家。」是的吳於此時却一無所染，絕不受他們的束縛，而能够獨闢蹊徑。有一天，胡公壽對吳說：「君的嗜畫似乎太遲了。」因爲吳習畫是在三十歲以後，當時任伯年在座，却跟着說：「胸中有才華，筆底有氣韻，遲些又有什麼關係！」楊見山也說：「畫不從畫出，而造基在詩文金石，積水厚力，能負大舟，是知參上乘禪的」。可見吳的作品，都具有古人所未有的境界意味，而自成一宗派，能學能變，先入後出，切合今之所謂創造眞諦的了。</p>
<p>以上所引的，是客觀的評述，吳本人的主觀怎機呢？吳的論畫詩有說，「墨氣脫手推碑同，蝌蚪老苔隸枝幹，能識者誰斯與邕！」又說：「謂是篆籀非丹靑。」又說：「螎扁幻作枝連蜷。」很鮮明的，吳是主張和實行用篆隸書法來繪畫的。吳論刻印有說：「贗古之病不可藥　紛陳鄧追遣踪。摩挲朝夕若有得，陳鄧外古仍無功。天下幾人學秦漢？但索形似成疲癃。……信刀所至意無必。恢恢遊刃殊從容。」又說：「鐵書直許秦丞相，陳鄧藩離擺脫來。」可以見到他不特寫石鼓文要改變了些原形，就是治印也要「自我作古」，而力空依傍。如作畫常題「師陳玉凡李復堂吳讓之張孟皋」，這是說明他的作畫是偶涉其趣，絕非全盤來仿效某一人的了。</p>
<p>吳對於他目己的寫詩有說：「吾詩自道性情，不知爲異，不知爲同。」他的朋友施旭臣叙他的詩是說：「……凡以自達其性情，不苟合於今亦不强希於古，所謂克自樹立者，其庶幾乎！」董其昌論書法說得好，「其始必與古人合，其後必與古人離。」合，是探求古人的規矩（法度），離呢，那是表現（發揮）自己的精神。吳的詩書畫刻印，從他的自白，我們可把黃山谷所說「隨人作計終後人，自成一家始逼眞」的兩句詩，很貼切的做了他的藝文絕對相對的註釋了。</p>
<p>吳的繪畫，松梅菊竹蘭石的較多，雜卉翎毛乘興間有所作，山水風格很高，中年以後却少繪作，人物最少寫。他的寫意花卉，用筆蒼健秀逸，雖略似徐靑藤陳白陽，而他的古拙深厚的氣韻，却上溯元宋，而至武梁祠畫像，變化神妙。他的構圖設色，眞如沈子培所說「胸蟠萬怪」的。用墨是乾濕並施，濃淡自然，淸妍沈鬱，深得古人所謂「潤含春雨，燥裂秋風」的妙旨，尤其是「垢中見淨，淨中藴垢」的地方，更下是僅懂塗抹的人能够領略個中的趣妙。他曾說；「畫宜膽大落筆，細心收拾」。若果作畫比之作文那就膽大落筆，即是迴旋篇法，細心收拾，即是追章琢句。故此，他的畫能在荒率中見精微，濃鬱中見淸遠，內蘊外表，似在畫中而又不在畫中。</p>
<p>齊白石的家世，是和吳昌碩不同階層，齊對古人的盡，最看不起的是四王（王時敏，王羣，王鑑，王原祁），最推崇的是石濤，而學習徐靑藤，八大。對於近人呢，只愛吳昌碩。齊有七絕詩云：「靑藤雪箇遠凡胎，老缶（吳昌碩的字）超奇出衆才。我欲九原爲走狗，（鄭板橋有印：：「靑藤門下走狗鄭變」）三家門下轉輪來。」可見齊對吳的欽服，居然把徐靑藤，八大山人，吳昌碩三人看做三位一體的老師了。</p>
<p>齊的作品，詩畫篆刻，與吳各有領域。他的自序詩草說：「時値炎夏，浹背汗流，綠蟻蒼蠅，共食野狐，穴鼠爲鄰。集中所存，大半直抒胸臆，何暇下筆千言，苦心錘鍊，學作獺祭魚」！他的悼詩絕句：「對酒高歌乞題贈，綠林豪傑又何人？「焚稿詩，「識字無多要作詩。」這些詩文都可以代表他的個性與風格。</p>
<p>此次齊來京滬，有人說齊是當今中國畫壇的唯一領袖。道句話除了齊的年紀外，在藝術上說似乎過甚其辭。但是同時有些人却批評齊的作品，是藝術叛徒，是野狐禪，而也未免黨同伐異，而是崇拜古人做偶像，硬拉人去做古人奴隸戕　創造的天才。老實說，在藝術上言吳昌碩，齊白石兩人都已跳出古人的束縛，發揮自己的技能。雖然吳齊的造詣有不同，成就也各異，可是他們已經是自闢蹊徑，各有他的面目，這是不可掩飾的事實。</p>
<p>藝人的生活行動有些是很特殊的，齊也不能例外而有他的怪僻。金息侯把他和吳佩孚，賽金花，列入燕山三怪之中，齊自己却與雪厂日厂三人，認爲是西城三怪，說是等於同光間的趙　叔德硯香們的西城八怪一樣。楊重子却以齊和張烏石，寄禪和尚，沈山人，爲湘潭四異人。無論怪也好，異也好，他的性情生活，都和普通人兩樣，他的藝術，自然也是特異的了。</p>
<p>齊的詩畫治印，都是自已　孳矻矻從刻苦中打出一條新路來，經過了幾十年的苦功，而成就了個人的獨特作品，下泯古，不趨時，純然是創作，這一點開創（革命）精神，是値得佩服的。雖然這些粗綫條，粗枝大葉，濃硃黑墨，跡近悍獷惡俗。可是我們要知道這就是齊的特點，也就是齊的作品不同於其他藝人的地方。我們要知道齊的出身是木匠，一個木匠而有如此的成就，能詩能憲，能書能治印，這當然不是一個尋常的人物。我們絕下能用士大夫的模型去範圍一個有天才有毅力有創造性的藝術家。和詩人丹第齊名的大畫家焦陀，是牧羊童，嶺南畫人高劍父原是藥材店學童，都不能妨礙他的藝術精進一樣。</p>
<p>在中國畫史上，吳齊本人都各有他的地位，這是沒有問題的了。不過，吳齊的作品，在他本人是成功的，但是此種成就，只在他的本人成就而已，所謂「得之者生，學之者死」。那麼，「世重其藝，我重其人」了。爲什麼呢？因爲學他們藝術的人，往往是勞而無功，多是失敗，不容易成就，最多也不過得其一點皮毛。個中奧妙，用不著怎樣的闡說，因爲各有他的天賦才能與思想，環境，造詣的不同，雖欲學之，也是徒然的啊。這一點，就是吳昌碩齊白石之所以區分，也是他們各有他的成就之原因吧。</p>
<h3>盆景談</h3>
<p>— 董叔瑜</p>
<p>盆景雖小道，然種類不一，佳搆難得。蓋除選材困難外，作者非特須熟識植物之個性，又須　備畫家游歷家，鑑賞家之各種修養，而有綜合的藝術天才，加以熟練之技術，始克有成。「盆景」爲總名，其屬於植物類爲美術盆栽及樹石盆景，屬於石類者爲盆石及山水盆景。</p>
<p>上述四者各有其特點，其美術盆栽重於栽植，園藝家有藝術修養者恒優爲之，除栽植改製維護之技術外，適當之材料與姿態之美好爲最要。扶桑人士提倡頗力，佳品甚多，有不惜多年心力加工栽培，始成一景者。美術盆栽大都以松柏及常靑植物爲主，取其觀賞之時期久長，古雅之樹椿允稱名貴。憑作者之技巧，加工改造，使其姿態紆迥屈折，或昂然挺拔，更須長期維護。望之精神奮發，蒼勁靑翠間有襯以小石補其景之不足，盆之形式或圓或方，高矮色澤瓷質，亦部與植物之形色相配合，方稱古茂可愛</p>
<p>樹石盆景爲立體之風景畫，擇與樹木像形而適合於盆栽之植物，配以小石，砌以土塊成雛型之山崗原野；或點綴小亭人物，而襯以綠茵，如碧之靑苔，作爲草原。木石人物務必比例確切，一草一木，亦位置適當；而色彩之配合允須淸雅脫俗。作者如無畫家意境，決難勝任。所用盆以淺爲宜。上述二者，乃以樹木爲主，而配以土石者也。</p>
<p>盆石爲盆景中之最單純者，亦即畫中之所謂淸供。即以石塊盛於淺水瓷盆中其石塊之求其格調高者極難，以天然形勝者最上，次者須略爲加工，就其氣勢細爲改琢；如遠山，如島形等，或取小景，於玲珊石隙是植菖蒲數莖，亦意態淸麗，趣味盎然，案頭相對，足以賞心悅目也。</p>
<p>山水盆景則意境遼闊，猶之巨幅山水之天然畫圖。此類製作以石爲主，石之稍具峯巒形態者，必先彫之琢之，使其意態相合；然後拼之凑之，以待相互砌合而成一景，若龐然巨塊者更難於施工，如全部彫琢失之自然，天趣毫無，而爲名符其實之假山矣。故一石之成先宜細細觀摩，勿忘勿助，草率施工後悔無及，石之本質各異，如沙積•樹積·木化石等，屬於質鬆者，其他英石·石許·火山石等，均性質堅硬，彫琢不善，顯有斧鑿，故須熟練石工及黏合等技巧；其外於石紋腠理，佈置草木，允須瞭然。而最要者爲全景之佈局，有寬曠之胸襟，而後有高超之章法。非似畫家作畫，胸懷奇景，可以隨意渲染。盆藝則拘於地位，限於物質，設局佈景，殊非易事。點綴適宜，不過火，不單調，輔以合式之材料，始有雄偉淸麗之作品。一盆臥游，悠然自得，風光之美，如直入宋元畫境，然佳作難得，可遇而不可求也。</p>
<p>綜上所述，乃各種盆景之大槪，此外尚有紙製盆景一稱，系利用廢紙及油靑混合物所揑成，再分別施以彩色，可以隨心所欲，其法盛於東瀛，專門製以作爲造園模型，不在本談範圍。</p>
<h3>談關良的近作</h3>
<p>— 倪貽德</p>
<p>破爛的舊卡車行駛在婉蜓陡峭的山道上是最容易拋錨的，常發動機發出了沉重低啞的嘶喊聲，再也無法前進了，司機和助手跳下車來耐性地修理的時候，乘客們焦躁地等着，是一種極難忍受的痛苦。但對於一個旅行的畫家，一個不論在什麼地方都能發現出美來的畫家，却是一個極好的機會。他往往在這種時候可以得到寳貴的收穫，採取到平時所不容易發現的畫材。</p>
<p>我猜想關良的最近的作品，有很多是在這種塲合裏產出來的。那便是一種深山大澤中的荒凉寂寥，而又帶點恐怖性的野趣。常住在江南平野的人們，無論如何也想像不到中國的西南西北的深山之中的情景。千重萬重的峻峭的山峯把你包圍在一個陰森的核心中；從千丈的峭壁下望，絕壑之底默默地流着冷冽的溪泉；在　密的森林之中，偶爾發現一間兩間山居的人家，永遠在度着被世遺忘的生活；茂草荆棘之中，像有惡獸猛虎的突然出現；有時成羣的驢馬大車呼嘯而過，打破了四山的岑寂，每一個公路的旅行者沒有不貪受著這種好奇的欣賞，而這種深山間的秘密現在却都收入在關良的畫面上。</p>
<p>一個聰明的畫家總愛好採取適合於自己表現的畫材，而那稱題材又影響到他表現技法，造成這一畫家的特殊作風。關良，他在中國畫壇是一位有特殊成就的人物，所以要了解他的作品，必須探求他的研究的路綫。關於這，我是知道一點的，他的作畫是從塞尚以後的現代繪畫的立塲出發。那便是放素了說明性　燥的橋寫，探求自然中色關的韻律，以明暗的關係來表示遠近的推移，用變形來强調物象的特徵，從色聲形的相互間的友撥和呼應來求得賽面的統一，由技法而達到無技法，避免一般的技法而追求特殊的技法。接着，他又發現了中國繪畫中的石濤一派的作品，是和現代的西洋繪畫有着不謀而合的地方。石濤以長年生活在山林中的體騐，領會了自然奧秘，以單純化的綫條和水墨的體律，表現出具有眞實感的山水聲，達到國畫少最高的境界，而和西洋現代繪畫有着共同之處。關良，他理解了這種圖畫上的神韻，巧妙地隔合在西洋畫之中，創造了他獨自的作風。</p>
<p>爲了適合於他的這種表現他開始了長途的行旅，從昆明出發，到了重慶，西行至成都，登靑城，峨嵋，折向西北，出劍門，越秦嶺，抵長安，登太乙，再向北而衹蘭州，再南返西安，沿隴海東行，攀華山之絕頂，出　關，登龍門，俯瞰黃河之勝，再返重慶，南下至貴陽，他的足跡，幾遍及抗戰時期大後方的全部地區，而也把這些地方的名山大川，勝迹奇景，描寫殆盡了。</p>
<p>復員以後，人們很難再有循着公路旅行中國內地的機會了。我想，凡是已經有過這種經騐的人，看到了他的作品，一定可以喚起當年經過深山大澤時的遼遠的回憶。而沒有去過的人，通過了他的藝術的表現，也可以領略到深藏在中國腹地的偉大奇險的自然境界。</p>
<h3>書法志奇</h3>
<p>— 顧肖虎</p>
<p>寳山張枕綠精研八法，草書尤為世重。筆者嚮往旣久，一昨造良晨好友社訪張氏，適逢張氏振臂寫聯，環集者多輩。筆者旣申索書之意，並竚作壁上觀。其所作聯，眞草隸篆行魏悉具，都出新句綴上款之名，載撰載書初不錄稿。</p>
<p>客有談及時人雙手寫草書者，張莞爾，命並聯紙於桌，復取一筆於筒，略事沾濡，遂亦雙腕並運。語人曰：「我有一閒章，文爲『非曰能之願學焉』也。」</p>
<p>讚歎集而興趣發，復命一聯，張易立桌左，側書上聯；其下聯則返原位而倒書之。又一聯竟飽蘸墨而閉目疾書，無有餘不盡之憾而神氣特勝。張擲筆笑稱，偶然游戲非常道。</p>
<p>旣而導客入一室，滿壁琳瑯，似與展覽之會。但言草書，逐字循規者我知其為章草，隸法草寫者我知其爲草隸，略可辯識者其殆小草，似顚似醉者狂草無疑。有屏四幅，草書之姿態又各殊。字字相聯繫，似走龍蛇而帶飛白，似柔無骨而隱韌勁，是何體歟？曰纏籐草也。筆筆相斷續，似竹之淸，似梗之挺，是何派歟？曰：折枝草也。運轉自如而八方力到者謂之運卦草。花飛葉舞而秀潤多嬌者謂之撇蘭草。似此勞人草草，庸詎草不恭！</p>
<p>綜其所作草書，幅軸尤恣　詭。經意處似歌慢舞，疎放處若掣電馳風，這有亂石鋪街，甚至點劃狼藉。有若干字意欲離行失伍，有若干字竟將辭紙冲飛。亦有一字據全行，遽一直到底以見神韻。或有某字重疊出，則各異其體以炫博能。匪特於草見才，直是以草爲戲！一微張加題之畫雜見壁間，其題山水云：『眞山眞水果然好，畫水畫山更秀奇。近處亭橋遠雲樹，一坡一草盡相宜。』題仕女云：『此是詩人畫，畫將畫意詩。眞眞呼欲出，默默寄相思。』皆有可觀。</p>
<h3>春意盎然</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>「以文會友，以友輔仁，」然後知「君子之交淡如水」的可</p>
<p>古詩：「古人結交須黃金，黃金不多交不深，縱令然諾暫相許？總是悠悠行路心！」引古證今，可謂「眼前寫照」！</p>
<p>但是我參加「文藝茶話會」之後，覺得：「風生四座，春意盎然！」揑筆桿的文藝之友，大家彬彬有禮，風雅宜人！晤言談笑，悠然品茗，沒有絲毫虛僞！也沒有絲毫俗氣！即揀座，也得選擇「閙中取靜！」力避塵囂！這也可見文友的孤傲和淸高！</p>
<p>「天涯此鄰來相聚，嶺上先開一枝春。」冬天裏的春天！在大家熱情的臉上，在大家熱情的襟袂，彼此親親熱熱的握手，彼此商量新知，推進藝術，男的女的，年靑的和年老的，濟濟蹌蹌，都流露出一股喜氣洋溢的熱情！來開拓文藝之花！來敦厚溫暖友情！這是我生平的幸運！也是我生平最感暢快的事！願「春意盎然」的文藝茶話會長春！</p>
<h3>安琪兒（顯聖圖之一部）</h3>
<p>— 李比</p>
<p>李比（Fihippo　Lippi　1406-1469）是當時寺院裏的一個畫僧。其作風旣有安基琍珂（F.Angelico）的叙情的詩意,又有馬薩西俄（Masaccio）的冷靜的寫實味道。尤其對於光的明暗的處理，形態的安排上，特別注意。此作爲廿七至三十歲所作，原畫現存意大利佛羅朗斯巴地寺中，爲美術史家列爲十五世紀末葉的代表作。（獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血155</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>外來的那些劍手，撤退的方向，正經過鶴見這邊席塲，所以跟鶴見鬥著的那個女子，和萍子兩人，也隨着大隊，一齊退走。別府這邊的劍士，虛應故事般的，跟在那外來的一帮人後面尾隨着，雖也一邊似乎追擊，一邊鼓噪，只不敢逼近，例像護送似的；只等那些劍乎退到牆邊，輪替着一部份上牆，一部斷後，然後一部份在牆上守護，一部份翻越牆外，最後牆上守護的，也一晃走了，這邊的人，才各人噓了一口氣，如釋重負似的，收刀入鞘，就算告了一個段落。</p>
<p>在虛張聲勢追擊外來劍士的時候，鶴見聽了萍子那兩句話，早已心下有些明白；不過因更看個究竟，所以跟在追擊的隊干後面，也隨聲鼓噪。好像不願讓那些外來的人手，從容撒退似的。後來看見來人都已越牆走光了，這才間着身邊的人，「牆那邊是什麼所在」？「爲什麼不追趕過去」？那人搖着頭說，「那是一座宗廟，佛威甚大。我們不能過去；首腦也不許我們過去」。</p>
<p>日本這個國家，是個莫明其妙的東西，矛盾得無以復加，一方而有人研究世界最新科學，一方面却是迷信極深；一方面雖是改進極速，差不多可以說是站在世界物質文明的最前綫上，而一面却是極端守舊頑固，所以直到今日，在若干地方，如有武士道械鬥起來，依舊可以看到數百年前，森林野寺，劍客激鬥的那種古風。在那種激鬥的塲合上，你要是用了新式手槍，電刀，等等器械，不必敵方恥笑，說你野蠻，就是目己一邊的人，也要因你而羞忿，甚至自殺。</p>
<p>「辛苦了，鶴見君！」有人在鶴見耳邊說了道麼一句，「相爺台駕，現在廳上候着。」</p>
<p>鶴見一聽聲音，立刻鞠躬答應「知道了；」心下知是想着，「這簡眞是唱戲，無聊的一齣武戲，且去聽這傢伙說些什麼。」</p>
<p>「鶴見君，今日的事，你是最淸楚的一人，還是最不淸楚的一人？」近　像上决一樣，擎着那副古劇化的架子，端端正正，盤腿坐在那隻矮脚床上；鶴見這次却也早已賜座，座位仍是那隻錦墊。電燈雖已恢復，這衷仍舊不用，却是點着許多日本原始式的四角和圓形吊燈，廳上一切，更顯得古代化。侍妾們，除了原有的那幾個外，又添了四個帶劍的女武士，一排的蹲在貼近那隻大屏風的脚下。</p>
<p>「……只敢說他們並不是專爲末職一人鬥劍來的……鶴見含忽的答應着。</p>
<p>「很對，」近衛似乎知道鶴見要說些什麼，「這是第三四次尋鬧了。他們認爲『八紘一宇』只限於現在的本土上，他們很滿意現狀，甚至維新以前的情狀；他們說高廳是一隻大象，「滿州」是一顆大炸彈；他們並不知道現世大局，下知道現世競爭的劇烈。因爲他們的首腦，曾經一度做過大臣，我沒有應用現代化的『手槍和炸彈』！……</p>

<h3>陰關難過聲中　銀行經理自白</h3>
<p>— 一得</p>
<p>銀行經理，一般的說，是何等値得人家羨慕的一種人物。不說別的，只要看電影，往往參入銀行家，作爲一種拜金者的偶像看。女人們追求他，順從他，社會上人恭維他，謟媚他。銀行經理似乎就是財神樣的代表人物，能够賺錢，能够用錢，記得抗戰時在陪都，銀行經理是爲一般女子所心折的對象，什麼簡任官，在她們滿不在乎，而是「銀行經理」先在神經上把她們征服了。曹愚的「日出」，不是也以銀行經理爲主角嗎？但是且讓我道苦經：</p>
<p>頭寸軋死</p>
<p>第一，軋頭寸苦。在從前，做銀行有季節性，頭寸的鬆緊有一定期，譬如茶季，絲季，棉期……只要事先準備好，到期是應付裕如的。但在今日做銀行業簡直天天在過年關，頭寸常常無從捉換，忽然的會鬆得放不出去，「爛」得痛心，又忽然的會緊得要命，竭力張羅，往往會弄到深夜還是下能「罷手」，急得人簡直要「上吊」。你總還記得成大銀號與建國銀行的故事，成大經理奔走羅掘了一個禮拜，結果還是上吊完事。你想在這一個禮拜中間，我過的是什麼日子，神經緊張得要昏暈，心裏跳躍得要破裂，東打躬，西作揖，受人家的奚落，看人家的嘴臉，精神上不能再忍受的痛苦與磨難，在常人是想像不到的，唯有銀行經理無法不嚐受之。道種情形，在小銀行最爲顯著，但現在就是各大銀行的經理也不能不吃這稱苦。</p>
<p>利息壓死</p>
<p>第二，做生意苦。銀行規定的存息是一分八，欠息一角三分半，業外的人沒有一個不說銀行的賺頭好。這眞是隔岸看火燒，不知內中人的慘苦。目前黑市利率即所謂高利貸者高至一角八乃至二角五，地下錢莊又活躍非常，有那個獃瓜會把錢送往銀行呆擱游資與銀行脫離關係已有多年歷史，而至今日爲尤甚。定期的更不必說，就是活期的也是絕無僅有。現在銀行所依靠的區區資金大多是零星散戶的活存餘額，這是受現鈔週轉不便之賜，一般商人非開個戶頭用本支票不可，於是今日存入五百萬，明日或甚至「當日抵用」四百九十萬，但總算有十萬餘額存在帳上，銀行就靠幾千乃至幾萬個十萬凑成一筆整數來週轉遝用，其內容的空虛以及運用的困難簡直像風中燭，沙上塔，實是經不起風浪與打擊的。</p>
<p>並且，在此僅僅零星的總和金額中，中央銀行必須提去十分之二作爲「存款準備金」，本身須提出十分之三作爲「提存準備金」，如此就提開了十分之五，可能動用的只有十分之五，以此十分之五的資金繩營貸放匯兌等業務，還要除去爛頭寸，倒帳等等可能發生的風險，想賺錢來支付借大的開銷與稅捐，豈是容易的事！</p>
<p>最頭痛是「當日抵用」，爲避免蝕去拆息，開戶時就要求當天解入支票，未待交換揭曉，須先准抵用，否則不開存戶。銀行為招攬存戶計，只得委屈求全。這個辦法風險大到不可限量。自己的頭寸給人家抵用去了，人家解入的票子一旦遇到退票，這筆款子如何可以追還？最近有某大銀行就發生這類事情，款子給人家抵用去了，人也逃之夭夭了。你想銀行生意何等難做。</p>
<p>第三，應付人苦。銀行經理辦事如不通融，人家就罵你古板，說是「朝南面孔」，乾脆下同你往來。如果做得太重人情，則吃虧的還是你自己。客人不懂手續，他總恨你多嚕囌，等到錢脫了手，一生問題，你的困難立即來了。討債的難，盡人皆知。特別在這個年頭，高利貸是公開的事實，但法院還是不保護你，你旣不能硬做，但也不可過分軟化，你想這個交涉又何等難辦，人事的應付是再痛苦也沒有的。逢到自己頭寸「缺單」的時候，那就是你倒楣的常兒，接二連三的打電話，一千聲一萬聲的求情道謝，但你要風，風不來，要雨，雨不到，如果平日應付得不週到，關係不密切，誰來管你的艱難，誰來救你的死活？此中微妙複雜，業外人如何體味得到？</p>
<p>所以，還是請你不要再恭維銀行經理吧。如果「伍員過關」是一齣最苦的戲，那末我每天唱的就是過關戲喲。你看，我的頭髮都急白了。</p>
<p>在這年代，我眞不知誰過的日子才是快樂的！</p>

<h3>在理髮室里　閒人　世間態　人間味</h3>
<p>昨天到理髮店裏去剪髮，見每個理髮師都招待得比往常殷動。爲什麼？我心裏奇怪着，剪完了，給我穿上了大衣後，一副笑臉，總是對着我。那種客氣能度，使我受寵若驚。當我在一疊萬元票子中抽了一半給他時，他微鞠了個躬，又是一臉笑容，說：「先生，從小年夜起理髮雙工呢？每年都是如此的，九千元够了」，哦！九千元，我心裏一戰，只得再慢呑呑的數了四張送到他手裏，正預備走，他對那同伴扮了個鬼臉，又拉了我的袖一下，輕輕地說：「先生，賞……」。對了，還沒有打賞呢？於是只得將這疊鈔票僅存的一張也給了他。自己以飛快的速度奔出了門口，險些給門碰了一個瘤，正想回去，一陣狂笑的聲音經過了我的耳膜傳到了心裏，他們明明在譏笑我，我氣悶極了！</p>
<p>我想信一萬元剃個取，十分之九的人都吃不消的，當我一模着頭上的髮時，立刻就有一付討厭的笑面出現，我又怒了，頭髮呀！頭髮呀！你不要再像貪官汚吏般的只管向上爬而不顧及你下面的人了，你這惡魔用普通機械是剪下盡殺不完的，但是，當心着，總有一天有種利器將你們剷光的，少去了你，也可减轉一重大大的累贅。</p>
<h3>討個吉利</h3>
<p>— 野草</p>
<p>從前富家都延有西席，款酬很厚，陰曆年關一到，西席先生心裏非常恐慌，因爲不知道下一年是否仍得蟬聯，所以年頭歲尾，特別要從很多小動作上討點吉利，而厭聞辭歇的信號</p>
<p>在某一個地方，有一位老先生，正是這個類型裏面的佼佼者，而且頑固不靈，迷信得一蹋糊塗。除夕之夜，老先生歲興蘭珊，翦燭就寢，睡前叮囑傭人，在他枕頭下面放了很多的「糕」餅。「這是什麼玩意？」傭人問。「（高）枕無憂啊！」老先生懷着鬼胎。接着睡下來了，老先生又命傭人在胸口安放一枚鷄一蛋」；「又是幹什麼？」『（但）放寬心！」老先生始終念念未忘於他的飯碗問題，自已就這樣以吉利話聊作解嘲。</p>
<p>守歲燭餘燼已殘，元旦來臨，老先生朦朧醒來，啊呀！胸口蛋不見了。急忙喊傭人。</p>
<p>「先生！滾蛋了！」傭人指着地板上狼藉淋漓的一攤，原來鷄蛋已下知在什麼時候被老光生翻身掉落地面了。</p>
<p>傭人原是無意冲口而出，而老先生認爲大下吉利，懊喪欲絕，無精打彩。</p>
<p>果然，東翁看西席昏頭昏腦，答非所問，下到年初五，就把他辭歇了。</p>
<h3>應時隨筆</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>在今年的歲尾年首，做老闆的十九感到頭寸欠缺，週轉不靈；可是一般工廠裏的工人，和中上人家的車夫娘姨大姐奶媽，他們和她們的囊中，都「麥克」「麥克」的相當豐潤。</p>
<p>譬如工廠裏的工人，他們的薪金，照生活指數計算的，平日苦吃苦用，收支情形比公務員好多，在這晨曆年尾又拿到了「雙薪」或「年賞」當然比較過得落。</p>
<p>至於「佣人」，在這歲尾年首，東家的應酬多忙，送年禮有着「回力」，達百分之二十的「佣金」，所以塲面越闊的人家，其收人也更可觀，到了新年裏，東家的親友上門拜年，送「蓮心湯」「元寳茶」，在中等的人家，佣人收入也很可觀，那富貴之家，更不必說了，這偌大的收入，雖然要勤勞望着整整的「一年」，但他們和她們在平時不愁衣食，很少額外的支出，所以在歲尾年首的季節，最是彼等「生財有道」的吉日了！</p>
<p>唯其是一般「工人」和「佣人」，所有歲尾年首的收入，是「可餘」之款，在戰前拿到鄉下去買田產，可是戰後却不然了，種田沒出息，所以有「放放拆息，但是近幾年來，物價飛騰，貨幣貶値，於是又轉移了眼光，有些囤國日用物品，而大多載却爭向銀樓兌取「金飾」，保持他們和她們的一年「心血」，不使私產隨着幣制的貶値而受到「損失」！</p>
<p>因之：上海的大小銀樓，生意興隆，尤其是在「新春」的半個月中，忙得不得開交，老闆夥計，帶着「新春的喜氣」，迎着這些主顧，莫以爲他們是小主顧，在出入的「利潤」，「份量」。聚沙成塔，眞是「好買賣」！所以在陰歷年關總結賬的時候，幾爿大銀樓的夥計，拿到的「花紅」，以「條子」計算，在今日之下，唯有銀樓，可以算是「天之驕子」，這是都由「通貨貶値」所給予的絕大機會！</p>
<p>在這新春，車夫娘姨……銀樓職員，皆大歡喜，而其他的各業，却十九在愁苦嘆窮呢！</p>
<h3>集體討債</h3>
<p>— 方文</p>
<p>年關緊迫，人欠欠人，照例都要淸了一下，因此前工部局華員千餘人，就在這急量殘年之中，舉行了兩决集體討債。</p>
<p>這筆舊債（儲蓄金，退職金，義老金，）債主多至數千人，時間又隔了八年抗戰，還牽上了些國際關係，以致討債年餘，迎對手方的債務人都沒有尋着，急得這數千債主，束手待斃，投江者有之，上吊者亦有之。</p>
<p>幸虧在日前第二次集體討債的時候，市長親自出馬，當衆說明，舊租界的產權債務，都已移交市府，親口承認市府爲債務人『寃有頭，債有主。』旣經尋到了債務人來，總算給數千債主，吃了一顆定心丸！</p>
<p>最後集體討債中的千餘債主，又當塲就公推了市長爲討債總代表，市長爲一市長，其地位原係債務人的代表，這樣一來，又變成債權人的代表了。這位身兼雙方代表的市長先生，一面要代表市府淸償這筆舊債，一面又要代表華員追討這筆舊債，似乎又要多做一次『三明治』了！</p>
<p>這筆舊債的債務人代表是市長，債權人的代表也是市長，將來還債的時候，手續上自可節便多多，等着吧！</p>

<h3>東北局勢的中心人物　熊式輝的二三事</h3>
<p>— 鈍父</p>
<p>東北行轅主任熊式輝自本月九日離瀋赴平，十一日晋京，向主席報告東北軍政情形，並對東北外交，尤其是大連問題的處置辦法，向中樞請示方針。這兩天，熊氏在首都接觸頻繁，非常忙碌。一方面，東北人士，正期待熊氏歸來後對當地有新的興革。</p>
<p>提起熊式輝，誰都知道他向任江西省主席，以「硬幹」「實幹」「快幹」而出名的。當時江西共軍盤據，官史貪汚，省政徬徨歧路，自熊氏主政，江西政治始上了軌道。據說當時這位熊主席常常穿了藍布長衫，到四鄉私行察訪，查見地方上有積弊惡習，輒予以斷然處置。有一個玉山縣的稽微主任侵呑捐款，被熊氏察悉後即行槍決。</p>
<p>熊氏本人兌江西人，治贛自有獨到之處。他出身是軍人，曾在日本進過軍校。抗戰勝利後，又奉命調長東北行轅，可見中樞倚畀之股。</p>
<p>凡曾經接觸過熊氏的人，或是讀過熊氏文章的人，一定知道熊氏雖然驍勇善戰，但實際上却是恂恂然如一學者。性嗜書畫，公餘即讀書作畫，理其風雅生活。記得舊時熊氏在滬遊龍華看桃花歸來，曾賦有七絕一首：</p>
<p>其隨身常携有佩文韻府，閒時從事推敲。每日淸晨，熊氏習劍的半小時，儒將風雅，令人折服。</p>
<p>『桃花如燒水如油，陌上春人鬥穀遊，最是龍華三月路，香塵初濫寺鐘樓。』</p>
<p>熊氏生平，有二件險事足記：一件是在北伐時率師追擊孫傳于芳於沂水，孤軍深入，幾瀕絕境；還有一件事，是某次熊氏乘機失事墮地，而熊氏却僥倖沒有和近來失事中航機的乘客同一命運，險透險透！</p>
<p>像熊氏這樣熟諳政治和外交而又精於詩畫的軍人，在中國實在是不大多見的。</p>

<h3>Yan'an Rejects Peace Envoys; Government to Issue Statement Today; Government Reorganization Proceeds as Planned</h3>
<p>Chairman to Host Banquet for Three Parties' Representatives Tonight</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to host a banquet on the evening of the 19th for government and Political Consultative Conference representatives such as Sun Ke and Zhang Qun, as well as important figures from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Communist Party has responded to the government's proposal to send representatives to Yan'an for negotiations, with a telegram arriving in Nanjing. At 10:30 AM on the 18th, Wang Bingnan visited the Special Envoy to verbally convey this reply, which roughly stated: "The CCP still insists on dissolving the National Assembly and restoring the military situation of January 13th as the basis for peace talks. If the government cannot accept these two points, then the government need not send representatives to Yan'an. If it is possible to accept them, then the CCP can immediately send representatives to Nanjing to conduct negotiations with the government." Wang finished speaking and then left. It is reported that the Special Envoy did not express any opinion at the time. At 5:30 PM, the Special Envoy responded to Chairman Chiang's telegram and went to the official residence, immediately relaying the two opinions Wang reported. He returned to the American Embassy at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding Yan'an's rejection of peace talks, the government will issue an important statement on the 19th. It is understood that the content will be roughly as follows: (1) Review of the peace talks over the past year. (2) Publication of the four-point new plan for restoring peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] It is reported that the new peace plan contains only four principles: (1) The method of peace talks will be for the government to send representatives to Yan'an or for the Communist Party to send representatives to Nanjing. The format will be a round table conference or other methods. (2) Immediate ceasefire. (3) Troop reorganization and restoration of transportation will be carried out according to previous agreements. (4) The issue of local government will be resolved through consultation between the two sides.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The issue of government reorganization is still proceeding simultaneously with the peace talks. There are many opinions from various parties. Although it was not raised for discussion at the Sun residence meeting today, Sun told reporters after the meeting that although the peace talks have been turbulent due to the Communist Party's rejection, it will not affect the reorganization of the government.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party and Youth Party Express: CCP Should Not Impose Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Zhang Qun, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Zhizhong, Lei Zhen, and Democratic Socialist Party members Zhang Junmai, Wu Lianzi, Jiang Juntian, Wan Renqian, Xu Chuanlin, and Youth Party members Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, and others, sixteen in total, held a meeting at Sun Ke's residence at 5:00 PM on the 18th to exchange opinions on the current situation. Because the Communist Party had already rejected the government's sending representatives to Yan'an, they immediately discussed the next steps. People from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party spoke successively, believing that the government has expressed its hope for the resumption of peace talks, and the CCP should not impose any preconditions, which is tantamount to closing the door to peace. Government representatives also expressed their agreement, believing that the government sincerely hopes that peace talks will resume. If the CCP insists on the two conditions, making it impossible for the government to consider them, then the resumption of the war will be caused by the CCP. The meeting adjourned at 9:45 PM. Premier Sun replied to reporters' inquiries, saying: The government will have an important statement on the CCP's reply in the coming days, and another meeting will be held on the 19th to exchange opinions and report to the Chairman. Lei Zhen also said: When the government expresses its attitude on this matter, the content of the new peace plan may be announced at the same time.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The new peace plan proposed by the government was further discussed at the Sun residence meeting on the 18th. In addition to the opinions exchanged between Lei Zhen and various parties in Shanghai, the plan was discussed carefully again today, with slight revisions.</p>
<h3>Statement by CCP Official</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to the New China News Agency broadcast from Yan'an on the 17th, a responsible person of the CCP Central Committee, in response to inquiries from the New China News Agency reporters, completely refused to discuss peace matters, and arbitrarily insulted Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 17th, a reporter from the New China News Agency interviewed a responsible person of the CCP Central Committee on the 17th, asking if Chiang Kai-shek would send representatives to Yan'an and what his purpose was. The responsible person of the CCP Central Committee replied: "On the morning of the 16th, Chiang Kai-shek, through Stuart, informed Wang Bingnan, the Communist Party spokesman in Nanjing, that he was sending Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to discuss peace, but this is completely a deceptive tactic. Chiang Kai-shek has ignored the two minimum demands proposed by the Communist Party, 'canceling the false constitution and restoring the military position of January 13th last year,' which proves that the so-called 'peace talks' are completely deceptive. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt is to occupy 165 cities and 179,000 square kilometers of land in the liberated areas, but after being defeated and having 53 brigades annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, he seeks a respite to consolidate the occupied areas, replenish the army, and re-attack. For this purpose, he now needs 'peace talks.' If the ceasefire agreement personally signed by Marshall and Chiang Kai-shek's representative Zhang Qun in January last year could be torn up cleanly by Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshall presided over unilateral aid to Chiang and launched a civil war, then what way is there to prove that it is not a deception when an American introduces a person named Zhang to open so-called 'peace talks'? Zhang Zhizhong himself also represented Jiang Jieshi in signing the Northeast Ceasefire Agreement on March 27th last year, but it was torn up by Chiang Kai-shek only five days later, and a major war broke out in the Northeast. What way is there to prove that anything negotiated this time will not be torn up by Chiang Kai-shek in a few days? If the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference presided over by Chiang Kai-shek in January last year could be torn up cleanly by Chiang Kai-shek, daring to convene an illegal 'National Assembly' and create a false constitution to guarantee dictatorship, what way is there to prove that the current so-called 'peace talks' have a shred of sincerity? Because of all this, we have completely lost trust in the currently clamored so-called 'peace talks.' Unless Chiang Kai-shek cancels the false constitution and restores the military position of January 13th last year, there is no way to prove that he is not deceiving. Therefore, to start negotiations, these two conditions must be met. The Communist Party and the people of the whole country are no longer willing to be deceived."</p>
<h3>Zhang Shenfu on Peace Talks</h3>
<p>CCP Should Not Impose Conditions at This Time</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Civil League representative Zhang Shenfu was originally scheduled to fly to Peiping on the 18th, but was canceled due to bad weather. After the CCP's reply was announced, reporters asked Zhang for his opinion. Zhang said: The CCP should not impose conditions at this time, and the United States should discuss them together. As for these two points, the government should agree in principle, but the implementation should be discussed together. Zhang expressed that the reorganization of the government should (1) have determination, (2) emphasize the spirit of democracy, and (3) demand national progress. Militarily, a neutral zone can be established, with a third party maintaining security. Regarding various issues of peace talks, Zhang expressed his willingness to continue to engage with government officials.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Civil League member Zhang Bojun told reporters yesterday that whether the Civil League will participate in the peace talks depends on whether the opinions of the KMT and CCP can be close. If the opinions of the KMT and CCP are still divergent, even if the Civil League participates, it will be of no benefit. He believes that whether peace talks can resume depends on the sincerity of both the KMT and CCP, and denies that Zhang Shenfu's trip to Beijing is carrying a mission. In addition, Zhang Dongsun's trip to Beijing these days is also to handle private affairs.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Representatives Arrive in Beijing; Zhang Junmai Will Provide Opinions on Peace Talks; Zhang Qun and Lei Zhen Jointly Pay Respects to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Lei Zhen, accompanied by Democratic Socialist Party members Zhang Junmai, Ren Hufulin, Wu Lianzi, Jiang Renqian, Sun Baoyi, Jiang Yuntian, and others, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 18th. After Lei got off the train, he and Zhang Jun immediately paid respects to the Chairman at around 9:00 AM, reporting on the business negotiations in Shanghai, and informing him that people from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party had been invited to Beijing to jointly participate in consultations on the resumption of peace talks and government reorganization. After Lei excused himself, he immediately called Sun Ke's residence to report everything.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] All the Democratic Socialist Party members in Beijing held a meeting at Zhang Junmai's residence at 12:00 AM on the 18th to discuss opinions on the new peace plan proposed by the government. Zhang Junmai and others were invited to Beijing by the Chairman, and Zhang will pay respects to the Chairman in the coming days to provide opinions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Representatives of various parties staying in Shanghai are successively going to Beijing to promote the resumption of peace talks. Zhang Junmai and his party of eight from the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 18th. They came here with great hope for the resumption of peace talks, but it is not known that the CCP has already publicly rejected the government's sending Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an for negotiations. Yang Jun told reporters: When they took the train from Shanghai to Beijing on the morning of the 18th, they had not yet heard this news. Because he had not read the content of the CCP telegram, he did not want to criticize it, but said: He hopes that this trip can jointly promote the resumption of peace talks with all parties.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Reliable sources say: Zhang Junmai's trip to Beijing this time is entirely the result of the sincere invitation of the highest authorities. It is heard that Zhang expressed to friends before going to Beijing that he hoped to return to Shanghai before the lunar New Year. In addition, people within the Democratic Socialist Party hope that when the peace talks officially resume in the future, Zhang can regularly represent and attend, and do not advocate that others replace him, so that his speech can accurately represent the position of the Democratic Socialist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Hu Haimen and Liang Qiushui, representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party in the North, were originally scheduled to fly to Peiping yesterday, but due to delays in ticketing, they changed it to today. When Yan Zhen left Shanghai this time, he strongly invited Zhang to go to Beijing with him, but the two did not go because party affairs in the North urgently need to be rectified. It is heard that the activities of the Democratic Socialist Party in the North cover North China and Northeast China. After the victory, they will absorb new members, and training work needs to be developed urgently. In addition, party members in the North have witnessed the people suffering from the ravages of war, so their desire for domestic peace is stronger than ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Marshall to Return to Washington, D.C.; Will Be Sworn in on the Same Day</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco 18th Broadcast, the White House recently announced: General Marshall will return to Washington next Monday morning, and will be sworn in on the same day, and will discuss important national affairs with Truman. Marshall has resigned from his military post, and will serve the country as a civilian official from now on.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 18th] The future development of the US mediation effort must await the new US policy toward China to be determined after Marshall meets with Truman.</p>
<p>Observers predict that the US policy toward China will be no more than the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) Take a laissez-faire attitude toward the evolution of the situation in China and have no fixed policy.</p>
<p>(2) Stay completely out of the matter.</p>
<p>(3) Assist the Chinese government's policy, but must stop the civil war and immediately reorganize the government to prove that it is sufficient to accept US assistance.</p>
<p>None of these three policies are satisfactory. Judging from Marshall's statement, the United States seems most likely to adopt the third policy.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Residence Refutes Rumors</h3>
<p>Rejects Claims that Soviet Ambassador Participated in Mediation</p>
<p>What Was Published in a Certain Newspaper Has Absolutely No Basis</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] A spokesman for General Marshall's residence announced today that the claim in the Xinmin Daily yesterday that Special Envoy Marshall had rejected Soviet Ambassador to China Petrov's willingness to assist in mediating the conflict between the KMT and the CCP three times is "completely unfounded." The newspaper also said that Zhou Enlai returned to Beijing from Shanghai to resume negotiations because Chairman Chiang's trip to Taiwan was due to Marshall's persuasion in order to leave room for negotiation. This is also inaccurate. In fact, Chairman Chiang's trip to Taiwan was decided more than a month ago. Marshall had persuaded him to stay a little longer, at least to have time to meet with Zhou Enlai in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Convenes Regulations Consolidation Committee</h3>
<p>First General Meeting Approves Agenda</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Ministry of National Defense convened the inaugural meeting of the Regulations Consolidation Committee at 3:00 PM on the 18th, presided over by Deputy Minister Lin Wei and Division Chief Liu Xiaoyuan. The participating units included the Naval Headquarters, Army Headquarters, Air Force Headquarters, Joint Logistics Headquarters, Military Personnel Division, Civilian Personnel Division, First Bureau, Fourth Bureau, Military Court, Comforting Troops Headquarters, Security Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and Historical Materials Bureau. It is reported that today's meeting passed the general meeting agenda.</p>
<h3>Various Election Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>Wang Chonghui and Wu Shangying are Studying Them</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Various election laws and regulations related to the Constitution are being preliminarily studied by Wang Chonghui and Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Wu Shangying. Once there is a decision in principle, the Legislative Yuan's special committee can conduct further research.</p>
<h3>Xikang Petition Delegation Demands the Replacement of Liu Wenhui</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Xikang people in Beijing petition delegation, due to the increasingly serious conflict between the military and civilians in the province, went to the National Government again on the 18th to petition. Director Xu Jingzhi received them and promised to forward the delegation's two requests to the highest authorities: to replace Liu Wenhui and his troops. The delegation then went to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and other agencies to petition, and hosted reporters at noon to report the facts.</p>
<h3>Receiving Dalian Issue</h3>
<p>Rumor Has It that the Soviet Union Made Two Demands to Us</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the representatives of the Chinese and Soviet governments are not currently conducting negotiations on the Chinese Changchun Railway, but the Changchun Railway issue is very different from the receipt of Dalian, the latter of which does not require negotiations. At the same time, it is reported that the Soviet government recently made the following two demands to the Chinese government regarding the Dalian issue: (1) The Chinese government should recognize that the Soviet Union can obtain enemy and puppet property, that is, what was received when the Soviet army entered Northeast China. (2) The management rights of the Chinese Changchun Railway, which was controlled by Japan during the occupation, should be handed over to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Supung Dam on Yalu River; Soviets Agree to Let Us Take Over Defense; Ownership of Supung Power Plant is Being Negotiated with South Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Soviet side agreed that our army will formally take over the dam on the Yalu River within our country's borders at the Supung Hydroelectric Power Plant on the 20th. Negotiations on the ownership of the Supung Power Plant are also being conducted directly by the Northeast Electric Power Bureau of the Resources Committee with the South Korean side. It is heard that negotiations have reached a concrete stage. According to the agreement signed between Korea and the Puppet Manchukuo in 1937, the ownership and related benefits of the hydroelectric power plant should be equally divided between the two parties. The power plant originally had seven generators, each capable of generating 100,000 kilowatts, for a total of 700,000 kilowatts. After Japan surrendered, some were dismantled or destroyed, and now there are only three generators left, which can generate 300,000 kilowatts. According to the principle that the assets of the Puppet Manchukuo should belong to our country, our country should have half of the power plant's ownership and power generation. According to existing calculations, the electricity to be transmitted to our country for application should be 150,000 kilowatts. However, although South Korea's electricity is extremely abundant, its northern authorities only provide other 3,000 kilowatts to our Andong for use. These 2,000 kilowatts must be exchanged for food, cloth, and other materials. Under the current situation where the vigorous promotion of industrial production in Northeast China requires electricity very urgently, if this negotiation can achieve a reasonable solution, it will make a great contribution to the revitalization of industry in Northeast China.</p>
<h3>Accompanying Her Father to Confront [Her Assailant] in Court: Ms. Shen Chong Sheds Tears, Uttering "That's Him!" Startling the Principal Offender</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 18th] The U.S. Marine Corps First Division military tribunal publicly tried the case of the atrocities committed by [U.S. Marine] Piertson at the Tungtan Drill Ground in this city. The trial resumed at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th, concluding at 12:10 p.m., and continued from 1:30 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. The court personnel included all military judges except for one fewer clerk than yesterday. Observers included Hu Shih, He Siyuan, Zuo Mingche, Meng Zhaoying, Ji Yuan, Li Shitong, Zhao Fengjie, Zhang Shuxian, Lü Baodong, Shen Shao, Yang Zhenqing, and over ten Chinese and foreign reporters. Shen Chong, accompanied by her father, entered the courtroom at 10:10 a.m., wearing a gray coat, with a perm, and a pale complexion, appearing tired. During the two-hour trial, she frequently shed tears. Hu Shih left midway through Shen's testimony, while He Siyuan remained in the audience throughout, paying close attention to the trial proceedings.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Young Reports on Transcripts; Examination of Witnesses Continues</p>
<p>Following the resumption of the court session, Assistant Prosecutor Lieutenant Young first reported on the trial transcripts from the previous day. Witnesses were then successively examined.</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Yingjie (officer from the Police Department's Affairs Section) testified that while on duty on the night of December 24th, he was patrolling in Patrol Car No. 2 when he was stopped by an officer from Patrol Car No. 1 at Tungtan at around 11:00 p.m., who reported that an American soldier had raped Miss Shen Chong. When he got out of the patrol car, it was around 11:30 p.m. At that time, he saw a young woman standing to the right of Car No. 1, with soil on her overcoat, face, and disheveled hair. The American soldier's overcoat was unbuttoned and covered in soil, and he had blood on his lips. He then escorted the American soldier and Miss Shen to the U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Headquarters. The American soldier sat in the front row of the patrol car on the right, while Shen sat in the back row, with an American military policeman and Zhang himself between them. When getting into the car, Piertson tried to help Shen, but she refused. At around 1:00 a.m. (morning of the 25th), when they arrived at the U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Headquarters, Shen's brother-in-law, Mr. Yang, arrived and spoke with them for over ten minutes. He then took Shen to the U.S. Army Military Police Headquarters, and later to the Police Department to report to Section Officer Meng from the Foreign Affairs Section. Afterwards, they went to the Police Hospital, where she was first examined by the attending physician for about fifteen minutes, followed by a detailed examination by Director Wang of the hospital, staying at the hospital for about four hours. After the examination, they returned to the police station, where Section Officer Meng questioned Miss Shen in detail, taking her statement and fingerprints. At 8:00 a.m. on the 25th, she was sent to her brother-in-law's residence.</p>
<p>(2) Corporal Kirkwood (U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Headquarters, serving in the Sino-American Liaison Office), the judge ordered him to identify the defendant. After confirming, he stated: he was the one who took the defendant into custody on the day of the incident.</p>
<p>Ms. Shen Likens Herself to a Mouse Encountering a Cat; Struggling Repeatedly, Exhausting All Her Strength</p>
<p>(3) Shen Chong (the victim), following the prosecutor's instructions, pointed out the defendant, Piertson, after looking around the courtroom twice. She then testified that she had been in Beiping for twenty-four days as of the 24th, staying at her brother-in-law's house. She was unmarried and had never been married before. Her tuition fees in Beiping were provided by her father. Before coming to Beiping, her father gave her 500,000 yuan. After arriving in Beiping, her father wired her 500,000 yuan and 1,000,000 yuan on two separate occasions, all deposited in the bank. She could not speak English, but understood a little. She then described the terrible circumstances of the rape on that day. On the evening of December 24th of last year, she went to see a movie. While walking east from the south entrance of Wangfujing, beside the wooded area on the side of the road opposite the Pingan Cinema, two American soldiers suddenly grabbed her, one holding her left hand and wrapping his arm around her waist, the other holding her right hand and wrapping his arm around her neck. When she shouted "Help!" the American soldier immediately covered her mouth with his hand. The two American soldiers first dragged her to the south wall of South Earth [Park], where they raped her once. At that time, she saw a flashlight beam once. After the rape, the American soldiers dragged her east, still along the south wall, and saw another flashlight beam. This time, they attempted to rape her again, but due to the flashlight search, this rape was unsuccessful. They then dragged her to the empty room in East Earth [Park]. She managed to escape, but was quickly caught by the American soldiers and slipped into a ditch, but did not fall down or kneel. Afterwards, she was dragged by the American soldiers to the northeast of the empty room. It was dark at that time, and she could not see Hatamen Street. She was then raped once more by the American soldiers. Shen testified to this point, then recounted that when she was at the base of the south wall, she discovered her pants had been taken off. Because they were white, she picked them up and waved them for help. "When shouting, the American soldier covered my mouth with his hand." When the American soldiers were raping her at this location (base of the south wall), another American soldier assisted. The scars on her legs were probably caused by the American soldiers at that time, but that American soldier soon left. At that time, she struggled and shouted again. Ms. Shen likened the incident to a mouse being caught by a cat, struggling repeatedly until she exhausted all her strength. She was then dragged by the American soldiers to the empty room in East Earth [Park], truly placing her life beyond consideration. At this time, her neck was choked, and she could no longer shout. Afterwards, when she was being raped again in the empty room in East Earth [Park], two people suddenly ordered the American soldiers to get up with guns. The three of them seemed to be fighting. At this time, more and more people arrived. When the prosecutor further inquired about her situation before coming to Beiping, she testified that she was nineteen years old and had been in Shanghai from 1937 to 1946. During the Japanese occupation, she never socialized with foreign soldiers. After this incident occurred, she had injuries on her body, legs, and lower body.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the defendant's defense attorney cross-examined her. Midway through the cross-examination, the presiding judge, based on Article 282 of the military law, announced that Miss Shen could refuse to answer any questions concerning facts after that day that might harm her reputation or interests. Shen said to the defense attorney regarding his question, "Was the statement given that the first intercourse was consensual and entirely under violence?" She replied, "In a state of panic, I cannot know the beginning." Midway through Shen's testimony, the presiding judge announced that female observers could voluntarily leave the courtroom. Subsequently, she was questioned about various circumstances during the rape in great detail for two hours, until the recess at 12:10 p.m., when Shen returned to her residence.</p>
<p>Doctor Examines Ms. Shen's Injuries; Fresh Tear Found on Hymen</p>
<p>The trial resumed at 1:30 p.m. (1) Wang Hecheng (Director and Attending Physician of the Police Hospital) testified that he was a Doctor of Medicine from Kyoto University in Japan and had been at the hospital for one year and two months. After examining Miss Shen at 2:30 a.m. on the 25th, he learned that she was Shen Chong. The examination result was: there was a fresh tear at the lower part of the hymen in the vagina, with an abrasion of 0.44 cm. Upon examination on January 3rd, he found (1) a laceration of 2-3 cm wide and 1 cm long on the knee joint, forming a scab. (2) In the middle of the left calf, there was a mung bean-sized scab, round on the inside and pointed on the outside. The defendant's defense attorney, based on paragraph 5 of his examination report to the police station on the 25th, which stated "It is difficult to determine whether she was raped," questioned him severely. According to his testimony, the judgment was based on the absence of sperm in the vagina, so it could not be determined. Finally, the prosecutor asked, "Are injuries caused by strong force or violent force the same as consensual injuries?" adding that the explanation of violence included mental threats. Wang testified that the physical abrasions were roughly the same.</p>
<p>(2) Lieutenant Young (Assistant Prosecutor) testified that the weather on the day of the incident was windless, and the roads were dark at night. Today's trial concluded at 3:10 p.m., and the presiding judge announced that the public trial would continue at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th.</p>
<p>Ms. Shen's Testimony Vivid and Detailed; American Soldier's Atrocities Fully Revealed</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th] Shen Chong, 19 years old, pale complexion, blonde hair, wearing a gray squirrel coat, light flesh-colored stockings, red foreign army sock garters, and light green leather shoes. After asking her name and origin, the prosecuting judge asked, "Please point out the defendant." Shen looked from left to right, to the far right, and saw Piertson sitting in the defendant's seat. She immediately pointed him out. After pointing him out twice, the judge asked Shen to come closer and point him out again. Shen went closer and pointed at Piertson, saying, "That's him." Piertson was extremely frightened. The judge then ordered Piertson to stand up to confirm. After confirmation, Shen answered questions. Subsequently, the judge ordered Shen to describe the circumstances of the harm she suffered at that time. Shen described in great detail, fully stating the necessary points, vividly. Many words were those that a young woman would not want to say, but to prove Piertson's atrocities, she revealed everything. Ms. Shen also answered several questions from the judge and the defendant's defense attorney: (1) The American soldier did not give her money. (2) She had never had any contact with any foreigners. (3) The American soldier's several atrocities were all forced. (4) One American soldier ejaculated, and a piece of the back of her coat was wet. His genitals had entered inside. (5) The scars on her knees were caused during the struggle. (6) When she was first seized, she knew the American soldier's behavior was bad, but did not know it was rape. (7) She never consented to the rape, and was always under violence. (8) She did not know if the American soldier was drunk. (9) Her mind was distraught after she was seized.</p>
<p>Hospital Director's Testimony Inappropriate; Beiping Mayor and Others Stamp Feet and Scratch Heads</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th] Wang Hecheng, Director of the Beiping Police Hospital and a Doctor of Medicine from Kyoto Imperial University in Japan, explained during his interrogation this afternoon that he had examined Shen's hymen at around 1:00 a.m. on the 25th and found a new rupture at the lower center, 0.4 cm long. There were no major changes in the uterus, and everything else was normal. Nine days later, he examined her again and found an abrasion three fingers wide on her knee, and a bean-sized blood spot in the center of the lower part of her left leg, round on the outside and pointed on the inside. The rupture of the hymen should be caused by abnormal and forceful intercourse. Shen Chong had told him that she had been raped, but no sperm were found in her vagina, so he could only determine that she had been subjected to forceful insertion, but could not determine that it was rape. Subsequently, the defendant's defense attorney repeatedly questioned whether the injuries caused by three rapes were the same as those caused by ordinary intercourse. Wang seemed to have never understood the meaning of "force," saying that the lacerations caused by force should be larger than ordinary ones, but the prosecuting judge then asked the translator to write out his question to show Wang, asking whether the injuries caused by "force" and "ordinary" could be distinguished. Wang then asked in detail whether "force" referred only to physical force or also to mental force. He then explained that it included the loss of resistance due to force. Wang then said that there was no difference in the injuries caused by the two. The prosecuting judge's raising of this question was opposed by the defendant's defense attorney, but after citing the legal code, the defense attorney was left speechless. The defense attorney had argued, based on Wang Hecheng's explanation of the condition of Shen's hymen, that it could not be determined whether Shen was a virgin before this. The prosecuting judge pointed out that it was beyond the scope [of the question] and objected unsuccessfully. Wang's answers, wording, and medical knowledge were criticized by Mayor He Siyuan of Beiping and other concerned parties in the audience.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th] The American soldier's rape of Peking University student Shen Chong case continued in public trial on the 18th. Five witnesses were questioned in the morning and afternoon, mainly Shen Chong and the examining physician, Wang Hecheng, Director of the Beiping Police Hospital. Shen Chong's testimony was detailed and orderly, while Wang Hecheng was nervous and serious. The prosecuting judge and the defendant's defense attorney repeatedly cited legal dictionaries during the questioning, and the prosecuting judge was mostly victorious. The audience was the same as yesterday. Because Wang Hecheng's testimony was inappropriate, Mayor He Siyuan of Beiping, Shen's father, and Chinese inspectors Ji Yuan and Shen Chong's two legal advisors in the audience stamped their feet and scratched their heads, restless. Apart from the victim's defense attorney trying his best to find loopholes, the judges' attitude was quite fair. Occasionally, when the translation was inaccurate, they showed the witness a written statement. The Chinese audience was all sweating for this international lawsuit. The 19th is a Sunday, and on the 20th, American doctors and others [will testify].</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Repeatedly Reinforced, Failing Repeatedly; National Army Steadfastly Defends Zaoyang with Blood; Chief of Staff Chen Arrives in Xuzhou to Inspect, Soldiers Inspired</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th] After the reserve soldiers of the Communist army in southern Shandong were increased, on the 16th and 17th, they launched a fierce attack on Zaoyang day and night. In western Shandong, to coordinate the Zaoyang operation, they fiercely attacked Yutai on the 16th. The battles have been extremely fierce in recent days. The Communist army has gathered more than 200,000 troops in southern and western Shandong, adopting a large-scale mobile warfare tactic, attempting to avoid strength and strike weakness, conducting fluid operations, and seeking opportunities to attack a single point with several times the superior force, nibbling away at the military strongholds on the periphery of Xuzhou to threaten Xuzhou. However, our military authorities have long been aware of their tricks and have made appropriate arrangements. If the Communist army insists on its own way, it will inevitably reap what it sows.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 18th] According to a general who arrived in Zhenjiang from Xuzhou, he told our reporter that the battle situation in southern Shandong and north of Xuzhou has now reached a decisive stage. The National Army will definitely be able to drive back the Communist army during the Spring Festival. Chief of Staff Chen's personal visit to Bian and Xuzhou to inspect and comfort the local military and civilians has greatly inspired the front-line soldiers. Chen arrived in Xuzhou from Zhengzhou at noon on the 17th. He originally planned to return to Nanjing on the same plane, but due to wind and other factors, he stayed in Xuzhou for a short time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 18th] Military news: After the National Army reinforcements to Lincao entered the positions one after another, the situation in Zaoyang has turned from danger to safety. Under the protection of the National Army, the coal mine workers in the area continue to work as usual. Most of the coal stored in the mines has already been transported out. Qicun, near Zaoyang, was rumored yesterday to have been recovered by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 18th] Military news: The Communist army infiltrated Yongcheng, attempting to break through Xiaoxian Yangshan and re-offend Huangkou, severing the connection between Longhai Bian and Xuzhou. This conspiracy has now been shattered. A certain unit of the National Army is currently counterattacking Yongcheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th] Last night, taking advantage of the wind and snow as cover, the Communist army bombarded the National Army in Yanzhuang with dozens of cannons, then repeatedly launched continuous charges with dense formations. The National Army calmly responded and defeated them all. Zaoyang remains unharmed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th] On the afternoon of the 18th, the National Army stationed in Xin'anzhen, east of the Longhai section between Xuzhou and Haizhou.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Retreat from South Bank of Songhua River; Jilin Battles Near End; Communist Troops South of Qitamu Cleared</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 18th] The Jilin battles are nearing their end. Only near Huapichang and Jiaowanzi on the Jilin-Changchun line are there still battles. Near Xiaofengman, the Communist army is attempting to destroy the power lines. The people of Yongji are reassured, as the 10th and 11th were the most tense days. Afterwards, the focus shifted to Jiutai Beimushi. There are no battles in the suburbs of Dehui. The troops occupying the railway stations south of the Songhua River have withdrawn beyond the station. The bridgehead north of the Songhua River Railway Bridge is still firmly defended by the National Army. The isolated troops are fighting hard, and the situation is precarious. However, although the Communist army is harassing, the northern bank of the Songhua River is rushing to build defensive fortifications, seemingly retreating. Fulongquan was captured by the Communist army a few days ago. There are no Communist troops near Nong'an. A large number of National Army reinforcements have changed the situation in the battle.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 18th] The Communist army on the north bank of the Songhua River has exhausted its strength in its southward movement. The Communist army in the triangle area of Bingji, Dehui, and Changchun has been surrounded by the National Army. The defeat of the Communist army is a foregone conclusion. There is much speculation here about the National Army's actions. It is rumored that two divisions of the National Army have crossed the river from Qianguoqi to outflank the Communist army in Wujia Station, Taolaizhao, and Wukeshu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 18th] Military news: The National Army recently began a counterattack against the main force of the Communist army in the Qitamu area. It has now cleared the Communist army in the area south of Qitamu. The Communist army is retreating north in disarray. There are still a few remnants of the Communist army southwest of Qitamu, and the National Army is searching for them. The National Army in Wulajie Dehui is also advancing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 18th] According to a military official here, after the Communist army was defeated in the Battle of Qitamu, the defense of Jilin has become more consolidated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] The Fengman Changchun power line was destroyed by the Communist army at around 2:00 a.m. on the 16th and has not yet been repaired. Currently, it relies solely on the small amount of thermal power transmitted from Xi'an and generated by the city's power plant to barely supply a few important military and government agencies and the water plant. Although the general public feels the distress of power and water shortages, the people are extremely calm. Military and police agencies have been particularly diligent in recent days, and security can be guaranteed everywhere.</p>

<h3>Express Train between Changchun and Yingkou to Run in Days</h3>
<p>Nearly 500 Kilometers</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] The "Asia" express train, which used to travel between Dalian and Harbin (a distance of 144 kilometers) at a speed of 11 hours during the enemy puppet period, will soon run on the China Chang Railroad, connecting the three provinces of Liaoning, Liaobei, and Jilin (Changchun and Yingkou). The total length of the line is 484 kilometers. This is the best and most frequent Chang-Ying direct express train performance after the restoration, which will facilitate it. During the enemy-puppet period, the train was named "Asia" because its maximum speed could reach 120 kilometers per hour, exceeding all railway locomotives in Asia. This train is a new-style streamlined locomotive of the (F8) type, with a locomotive head weighing 199 tons. It was damaged during the Soviet garrison period and has now been repaired by the railway machinery staff here, so it is named "Changchun." It test ran between Changchun and Shenyang earlier this month and went well.</p>
<h3>Guaranteed Postage Restored in Areas with Rail Access; Value-Declared Registered Letters Being Piloted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Guaranteed postage was mostly suspended due to the war. Now that the war is over and conditions in various places are gradually returning to normal, the post office has been ordered to first restore domestic guaranteed postage services in areas with rail access, including guaranteed letters, guaranteed boxes, or guaranteed parcels. In addition, the post office is piloting a type of domestic value-declared registered letter, with procedures simpler than guaranteed postage. In areas where transportation is inconvenient and guaranteed postage cannot be sent, or where the value is small and there is no need to send guaranteed postage, it can be sent as a value-declared registered letter for convenience. The maximum value for this value-declared registered letter is temporarily set at 50,000 yuan, with a value declaration fee of 10% in addition to the registered postage. In the event of loss or damage, the post office will compensate according to the provisions of the postal law based on the declared value of the contents, except for losses due to natural disasters, accidents, or other force majeure events. In the future, certificates, deeds, registered or unregistered checks, red tickets, blue tickets (postal money orders not included), and all other important documents and receipts can be sent as domestic guaranteed postage or domestic value-declared registered letters as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Siam Launches Another Large-Scale Anti-Chinese Campaign; Thugs Set Fire to Over 600 Shops of Overseas Chinese; Thousands Homeless with Alarming Property Losses</h3>

<h3>If Communist Troops in Northeast Stop Attacking, Changchun Radio Station Will Be Unsealed; Conversation with Person in Charge of Peiping Military Mediation Department</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] A person in charge of the Military Mediation Department made some explanations on the issue of the Communist Party radio station in Changchun being sealed: (1) Five divisions of Communist troops in Northeast China have crossed the Songhua River to invade, personally commanded by Lin Biao, with the aim of capturing Changchun and Jilin. (2) The Military Mediation Department in Changchun did not carry out mediation work a month ago, especially the Communist Party. Its personnel in various groups in the Northeast have also withdrawn, so the Communist Party has in fact abandoned mediation work. Its radio station in Changchun was likely to inform the Communist army during the large-scale offensive, so it was sealed. It will be unsealed as soon as the Communist army stops attacking.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th] The issue of the existence or abolition of the Military Mediation Department today is confusing. Today, Cai Wenzhi stated that although the Military Triad above the Military Mediation Department is no longer complete and has stalled, the Military Mediation Department still has its basis for existence. From the beginning when the Military Mediation Department was established, it was stipulated that its cancellation must be proposed by Chairman Chiang of the National Government or Chairman Mao of the Communist Party before it could be cancelled. So far, neither of these situations has occurred.</p>
<p>Ye Jianying Lodges Protest</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Today, Ye Jianying lodged a protest with Government Commissioner Zheng Jiemin and U.S. Commissioner Gillen regarding the closure of the Communist Party radio station in the Changchun branch. He stated that, according to the report of Major General Li Chuli of the Changchun Garrison Headquarters, on the 16th, officers of the Changchun Garrison Headquarters led more than a dozen officers and soldiers with loaded pistols into the Communist Party dormitory, forcibly seizing the radio station and parts and tools. The Communist Party personnel were also monitored. He continued: This kind of action destroys peace talks and strikes at the Executive Headquarters. I hereby lodge a serious protest with Commissioner Zhou and ask you to transfer this to the Changchun authorities to immediately return the radio station and restore work. In addition, I propose that the three commissioners convene a meeting to discuss punishing the perpetrators. Apart from this protest letter, the Communist Party has taken no other action. However, according to a certain Communist Party member, if the reply is not satisfactory, the Communist Party may consider withdrawing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 18th] U.S. representative to the Military Mediation Department, Lieutenant General Gillen, today authorized the CCP delegation to continue to use the radio freely, continuing to receive and send telegrams to Changchun in plain code. Gillen had lodged a protest with government representative Zheng Jiemin of the Military Mediation Department, but Zheng has not yet replied. Ye Jianying is now using the actions of the Changchun Executive Headquarters as an excuse, believing that the government intends to abolish the Military Mediation Department, and demanding that the U.S. and government representatives immediately convene a meeting to discuss all issues. Ye also submitted a tough memorandum to the U.S. and government representatives.</p>

<h3>Cai Jinjun Reports to Reporters on the Situation of Governance on Hainan Island, Security is the Most Serious Problem</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] Cai Jinjun, member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee and director of the Qiongyai Office of the Provincial Government, recently met with reporters to report on the situation of governance on Hainan Island. According to him, the most serious problem on Hainan Island at present is security. Recently, the provincial government dispatched six security regiments to be stationed in Qiong to actively suppress bandits. At the same time, it strengthened local grassroots organizations, building 486 blockhouses, with more than a hundred more to be completed soon. It also issued more than two hundred light and heavy machine guns and more than ten thousand rifles to various counties. Nineteen self-defense battalions have now been established, along with two hundred and fifty-seven self-defense teams, and the training of cadres is being intensified, and political mobilization is being implemented. The most effective measure at present is the Bandit Suppression and Village Rescue Committee, where local gentry and elders are enthusiastically working in the countryside. The first phase of the bandit suppression plan has been completed on schedule, and the second phase is starting now. It is expected that the bandits on the island will be cleared in a short period of time. As for construction, Chairman Qian Changzhao of the National Resources Commission flew to Qiong to inspect and plans to develop [resources]. However, the prerequisite, in addition to security, is to ensure smooth transportation and self-sufficiency in food. After the recovery, most of the highways on Qiong Island were damaged. After repeated repairs, the entire line is now passable. At the same time, agricultural water conservancy and cooperative enterprises are being organized to increase rural production. Qiongyai is rich in resources, especially fishing, salt, and sugar industries, which are easy to operate and develop, and are closely related to the national economy. It is hoped that people across the country will actively immigrate and invest. Due to the improvement of security on the island, many overseas Chinese from various parts of Southeast Asia have recently returned. According to statistics for the past few months, remittances from overseas Chinese are about 2 billion yuan, and this month it has increased to 5.1 billion yuan. Cai concluded by saying that Qiong Island is isolated overseas, and the actual situation is often unknown to people in the country. Moreover, after their disastrous defeat, the bandits specialize in spreading rumors to confuse people. For example, it was recently rumored in Nanjing that the price of rice in Qiongyai is 200,000 yuan per *dan*. In fact, the price of rice on the island once rose to 90,000 yuan in September and October due to typhoons and floods, but it has since fallen sharply after price controls were implemented. At present, the highest price of rice on the island is in Haikou, at only about 40,000 yuan per hundred *jin*. As for food planning, the government and local people have made preparations in advance, so there is no cause for concern, he said.</p>

<h3>The Youth League Holds General Verification and Issues a Letter to All Members</h3>
<p>[Central Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Central Executive Committee of the Three People's Principles Youth League has decided to hold a general verification of all members starting on the 15th of this month and will send standing members to various provinces to guide the process, so that it can be properly handled and completed as scheduled. In order to enable all members to understand the significance of the general verification, a letter to all members has been issued, highlighting four main points to arouse the common [effort] of all members. The original text of the entire letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To all comrades of our League:</p>
<p>The purpose of the establishment of our League is to gather new forces for the national revolution in order to achieve success in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and to concretely realize the Three People's Principles. During the War of Resistance, all our comrades, under the leadership of the great leader, united sincerely and fought bravely, which was able to inspire the revolutionary youth of the whole country, unify their will, concentrate their strength, and do their utmost for our sacred national War of Resistance in order to win the final victory. Now that more than a year has passed since the victory, the obstacles to peace and unity have not yet been completely eliminated, and the concrete realization of the Three People's Principles requires redoubled efforts. The Second National Congress of our League convened to review the current revolutionary situation and the tasks of the League in the future, and unanimously agreed that consolidating the revolutionary ranks and strengthening the organizational forces are essential for the revolution in the future. Therefore, following the instructions of the leader and with unanimous resolution, the general verification of League members was held. After the establishment of the Second Central Executive Committee, the verification methods were carefully discussed and decided upon, and signed by the leader. Now that the start of the event is required, in order to reveal the significance of it.</p>
<p>(1) Consolidate the Revolutionary Ranks and Strengthen the Forces of the Republic of China</p>
<p>This general verification of League members by our League has two meanings: One is to verify the strength of the League: Over the past ten years, all young people across the country, under the inspiration of the great leader, have enthusiastically joined our League to serve the sacred national War of Resistance. The ranks are very strong and the contributions are great, but due to rapid development, various shortcomings are inevitable, such as inaccurate League membership, unsound grassroots organizations, and the relationship between League members and the League is not strict. As a result, the meetings cannot be fully implemented and the tasks are difficult to complete as scheduled. In order to correct these shortcomings, it is necessary to conduct a general verification of League members, thoroughly clarify League membership, eliminate disloyal and undisciplined elements, and strengthen the tightness of the organization, just like the military. In order for it to be able to accomplish combat missions, attention must be paid to review and verification. Therefore, the purpose of this general verification of League members is to improve its own verification strength, so that it can shoulder the task of revolutionary national reconstruction. The second is to adapt to the requirements of democratic constitutionalism: After the Second National Congress of our League, the country is entering the stage of implementing constitutional government. The National Assembly has now successfully completed the task of constitution-making, and the democratic constitution has also been promulgated by the government. The task of our League in the future is to [ ] with democracy [ ], [ ], the main [ ] political meeting, and participate in the work of building the League. Comrades of our League should know that the essence of democratic constitutionalism is decided by the majority. Therefore, the struggle of the body is more important than the struggle of the individual. If the organization is not sound and the discipline is not strict, then [ ] steps [ ] will be consistent, and strength will have no way to [ ]. Another meaning of the [ ] verification is to gather revolutionary youths under a strong organization, engage in public [ ] competition in a democratic way, actively participate in the [ ] elections of people's representative bodies at all levels, gain the trust of the masses, and then serve the masses, by [ ] the revolutionary propositions of our League, and then develop genuine democracy, [ ] solid constitutional foundation.</p>
<p>(2) Consolidate Revolutionary Leadership and Eliminate Obstacles to National Reconstruction</p>
<p>The fifty years of the National Revolution [are led by] our Party [ ]. The establishment of our League is actually the generation of new forces for the National Revolution. The reactionary forces that are currently undermining the National Revolution are: One is the armed violence groups that hold onto troops and divide up territory, undermining the unity of military and political orders, threatening the great cause of our Party's fifty years of struggle for unity and democracy. The other is corrupt officials, local bullies and evil gentry, as well as comprador merchants, who indulge their insatiable desires, stir up prices, and exploit themselves, creating distance between the people and the government. These two major reactionary forces have made Chinese politics turbulent and backward, and social order chaotic. If these evil phenomena are not completely eliminated, then national reconstruction cannot be promoted. To eliminate the obstacles to national reconstruction, we must first consolidate the revolutionary leadership, thoroughly implement the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that the success achieved by the Principle of Nationalism has a deeper and more unshakable foundation, in order to implement the ideal of the Three People's Principles revolutionary national reconstruction.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>French Political Situation and Anglo-French Alliance</h3>
<p>The French National Assembly and Senate held a joint meeting on the 16th at the Palace of Versailles to elect the President of the French Fourth Republic. Socialist leader Vincent Auriol was elected with an absolute majority of 452 votes. The Blum cabinet, which had the nature of a provisional government, submitted its resignation to President Auriol in accordance with the provisions of the new French Constitution. Auriol accepted it because he had completed his mission successfully and appointed Socialist figure Paul Ramadier as Prime Minister. After Ramadier was ordered to do so, he met with leaders of various parties to begin organizing a new cabinet. He also visited the outgoing Prime Minister Blum and former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault for discussions, which were particularly valued by all parties. It is expected that the new cabinet will be established soon with the joint support of various parties, which will bring an end to the provisional political system in post-war France. From now on, French politics can embark on the right track of democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>The Blum cabinet lasted exactly one month from its formation to its resignation. Although it was a short time, its achievements in this one month exceeded those of any previous cabinet. Domestically, post-war France can be described as a country with many difficulties, especially in the financial and economic aspects, which were riddled with holes, making people's lives extremely difficult. If the government authorities could not make drastic moves and dare to act, it would be impossible to solve the current economic difficulties. However, since Prime Minister Blum formed the cabinet, relying on his past political experience and his political wisdom, he devoted himself to the work of suppressing prices. On the one hand, he ordered merchants across the country to reduce wholesale and retail prices by 5 percent across the board. On the other hand, he dissuaded workers and civil servants from demanding wage and salary increases, so that the lives of every French person could gradually stabilize from now on. Although Blum's implementation of this policy of suppressing prices also encountered many difficulties and obstacles, the results of its implementation were satisfactory, which is a rare achievement in French political history.</p>
<p>Secondly, in diplomacy, Prime Minister Blum personally visited England and met with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. The two thoroughly exchanged views on the policies that the UK and France should adopt on the German question, and immediately reached a consensus, which gradually brought their different opinions into alignment. Britain's permission to supply France with as much coal as possible from the British-occupied area of the Ruhr region to relieve France's immediate needs can only be said to be a major achievement of Prime Minister Blum in diplomacy. At the same time, this trip also laid a good foundation for the Anglo-French alliance. It is reported that the drafting of the treaty will be held simultaneously in Paris and London and will soon be established, which will also have a great impact on the future development of the European situation.</p>
<p>Blum took up the arduous task last time in response to the love and support of all parties. At the same time, for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, he had to take up the arduous task in this time of crisis and serve the country again. Over the past month, he has made achievements in both domestic and foreign affairs, and can be said to have completed his mission, opening a good starting point for his successor. It is also right to retire successfully and no longer worry about the country; moreover, Blum is old and frail, and he is really incompetent for the important task of the country; therefore, Blum's resignation was originally expected. Now that Ramadier has taken over, there is no problem in forming a cabinet, but his future policies, regardless of their nature, will continue the domestic and foreign policies of the Blum cabinet. On the one hand, he will continue to work hard domestically to suppress domestic prices, so that people's livelihood can be stabilized; on the other hand, in diplomacy, he will conduct talks with Britain to complete the Anglo-French alliance treaty, so that France can truly become a bridge between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>As for the rumors of the Anglo-French alliance treaty, as early as the Chinese New Year last year, the international community was full of such rumors. At that time, French Provisional President and Prime Minister Félix Gouin publicly delivered a speech: "France must find a way to establish an Anglo-French alliance as a supplement to the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty. If, because of these two alliance treaties, a tripartite treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can be further concluded, then that would be the best." Then, the French Socialist Party held a plenary meeting and issued a letter to the French people, which also said, "France should sign a treaty with Britain that is similar in nature to the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty, in order to enhance the political and economic cooperation between the people of Britain and France." From this, it can be seen that the Anglo-French alliance is a consistent policy of the French Socialist Party, and under the leadership of Paul Ramadier, a leading figure in the Socialist Party, the Anglo-French alliance will not be a problem.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Anglo-French alliance treaty is to prevent Germany from invading again, thereby safeguarding peace and security. Strictly speaking, the Anglo-French alliance is enough to enhance peace in Europe; the reason is that after the war, Britain and France had many conflicting opinions on the German question. After this alliance negotiation, it will surely be cleared up, which will be of great benefit to the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting currently being held in London and the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in Moscow in March to discuss the German-Austrian peace. However, on the other hand, we must not be wary of the Soviet Union's misunderstanding. If the Anglo-French alliance is regarded as an anti-Soviet Western European group, then Europe will be divided into two Europes, East and West. From the sudden return of Soviet Ambassador to France Aleksandr Bogomolov to Moscow for consultations, it can be seen that the Soviet Union still cannot avoid some concerns about the Anglo-French alliance. We believe that France must not only eliminate the Soviet Union's misunderstanding of the Anglo-French alliance treaty, but also promote Anglo-Soviet relations. The success or failure of French foreign policy depends on this.</p>

<h3>Corruption Case at Zhejiang Provincial Department of Transportation, Suspicion Remains High After Investigation, Supervisory Office Continues to Receive Accusations with Even Larger Scope</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] The sensational corruption case at the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Transportation in Hangzhou was also discussed by the Resident Committee of the Provincial Senate yesterday, and similar letters of accusation were received. The case has been investigated by the Zhejiang Supervisory Office. According to relevant sources, the investigation has revealed many suspicious circumstances of corruption. The most suspicious thing is that the monthly reimbursement reports of various departments of the department were not sent in the current month. Therefore, the prices of materials listed in the various ledgers may have the suspicion of underreporting and overreporting according to market prices. Regarding the Qiantang River Ferry, the management of materials and reimbursement were handled by one person, namely the accountant and cashier, which is not in accordance with the law, and there may be corrupt practices inside. Regarding the vehicles in operation, a vehicle daily report form should be filled out in accordance with the regulations, but the department did not comply, so the suspicion of private use of vehicles is very high. In terms of oil materials, the department's gas station has no clear records to compare the amount of oil received and the amount of oil used each month, which is a confusing mess. Zhang Xun, the investigator sent by the Supervisory Office, submitted a report yesterday on a part of the investigation results to Supervisory Commissioner Zhu Zongliang for review. Moreover, the Supervisory Office recently received an accusation that the department was even more involved in engineering corruption in Ningbo. The amount of corruption indicated in the original complaint is very large, and the case is more serious than the previous case. However, the Supervisory Office believes that the location of the case is far away in Ningbo, and corruption in engineering may not be detected without specialized talent. Therefore, no formal investigation has been conducted yet. For the sake of caution, experts will be hired to go to Ningbo together to investigate the truth. According to Supervisory Commissioner Zhu, speaking to this newspaper's reporter, although the above are two cases, they both involve the Department of Transportation, so they should be handled together. Therefore, the truth of the case must wait until the investigation of both cases is completed before it can be fully announced.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Hastily Retreat from Shuyang, Houses in the City Fortunately Spared, Qianji Battle Fierce, Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin News] On the 10th, amid continuous rain, the Nationalist army recovered Shuyang in one fell swoop with lightning speed. The communist troops were caught off guard, and retreated in panic, crossing the Shuyang River and fleeing towards southern Shandong. This reporter accompanied Director Sun of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Gongyu, and others on a jeep from the Huai River Insurance Office of the Sunning Branch to inspect the battlefield on the 11th at noon. When they reached the southern suburbs of the county, they saw the people supporting the old and the young, welcoming them on the road. Director Wang stood up in the car, comforted them, and conveyed the virtues of the central government and the provincial government. The listeners were deeply moved, and many were overjoyed and wept. An old man with white hair wept uncontrollably. After being persuaded to stop, it was learned that the old man's surname was Chen, over seventy years old, with two sons, who were both killed by the communist troops. The land was divided and the house was torn down. He could barely make a living. Now that the pain has subsided, he felt as if an infant had seen its mother, and grief came from within.</p>
<p>Later, the car drove into the city and inspected it for a week. The houses in the city were intact, which was somewhat comforting. It is a miracle that the cruel communist troops were able to leave this intact and hand it over to others. He immediately chose an old man to inquire. According to him, "The internal conflicts of the communist troops were fierce, and the soldiers had no fighting spirit. On the eve of the abandonment, they decided to drive the people out of the city and implement a scorched earth policy, setting the entire city on fire. Fortunately, the Nationalist army advanced rapidly, catching them off guard. If they had delayed for a moment, it would not have been preserved. We are grateful to the Nationalist army for leaving this remaining residence for us to live in. It was an unexpected stroke of luck. The communist troops are inhumane and would never let go easily. Before retreating, they killed as many as six or seven hundred good people. Now, in the six towns and townships in the urban area, there are about 3,000 households. The young and strong have been coerced away, leaving only the old, weak, women, and children, groaning in the aftermath of trampling and destruction, and seeing the light of day again."</p>
<p>A group of more than ten people stepped into the gate of the division headquarters of the New Security Army - part of the fake Sixth Administrative District Commissioner's Office - the houses were spacious, and Division Commander Zhang Lingfu greeted them with a smile, shaking hands with them one by one. District Commissioner Ji Yuzhi of the Seventh District called him "Victorious General." Zhang said repeatedly, "I dare not, I dare not." After sitting down, Song Zixin, the commissioner of the Social Affairs Department, discussed relief measures with Director Wang. It was decided that the Political Department should send personnel to assist the six town and township chiefs in the urban area to conduct a preliminary survey of the number of households, fill out a certificate for each household, and issue 10,000 yuan of relief money according to the certificate. Zhang Tongmo, director of the Huaiyin Office of the Suning Branch, rushed back to Huaiyin overnight to transport flour. The flour would be distributed to each household as a bag to provide emergency relief. Director Wang temporarily stayed in the county to supervise county affairs, plan for restoration, and assist in handling relief matters. However, as of late at night, County Magistrate Tang and the county government personnel had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>On the way back, Director Zhang told the reporter that Qianji, a town in Shuyang, faced the Liutang River. The communist troops relied on the danger to defend it to the death. The battle was fierce. Now the town is ruined, with only a pile of rubble left. The 240 bags of flour and 120 bags of soybean flour that were transported there could not find a relief recipient. Only the flour was temporarily stored in the town and entrusted to local people nearby to guide them to the four villages for on-site inspection and distribution. From this, the situation in the disaster area can be seen.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Government Applies for Emergency Industrial and Commercial Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Minhang News] Ni, the magistrate of Shanghai County, stated that various industrial and commercial sectors in the county have been affected by high-interest loans, resulting in sluggish business and frequent closures and liquidations. He has specifically requested the provincial government to forward the application to the Western United Relief Association for an emergency industrial and commercial loan to provide assistance. The process will involve the county government convening the County Chamber of Commerce and the Minhang Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank to form a syndicate and apply to the Western United Relief Association for the emergency industrial and commercial loan. The total loan amount is 30 million legal tender.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Arrests Two Individuals for Impersonating and Forcibly Selling Books and Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pinghu News] Recently, two individuals impersonating staff from the Shanghai China Cultural Supply Cooperative have been discovered in the county. They have been forcibly selling books and newspapers to various businesses and defrauding them of money, causing anger among the businesses. The Cultural Supply Cooperative recently sent a letter to the county government requesting the arrest of Shen Futang and Shen Daosheng, former employees who were dismissed, as they were selling books and newspapers in various counties and towns in the tenth district, damaging the cooperative's reputation. The county government then ordered the police to investigate and arrest them. They were captured in Xincang the day before yesterday and brought to Pinghu. They were transferred to the Judicial Office on the 16th for interrogation. However, according to Shen Futang, they are not former employees who were dismissed from the China Cultural Supply Cooperative.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Youths Discovered in Shengze Hongdou Village</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujiang News] Recently, six youths from northern Jiangsu were discovered begging from door to door in the Shengze Hongdou Village area, lingering and refusing to leave. The village self-defense force, suspecting their behavior, questioned them. They claimed to be from Pixian County in northern Jiangsu, but were evasive about other details. A search of their belongings revealed that they were all wearing grass-green lined clothing. One of them, Sun Maokai, was also found to be carrying five silver dollars and several pens and pencils. They were all sent to the district office. After questioning by District Chief Jiang, they were transferred to the Wujiang County Government for legal processing.</p>
<h3>Lieshan Coal Mine Resumes Operation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suxian News] The Lieshan Coal Mine, located near Suixi Town in this county, was first mined by local people using manual and animal labor in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), producing 100 tons of coal per day. In the fourth year of the Republic (1915), Ni Danchen took over the operation and purchased seven machines, increasing the daily output to 500 tons, and the business was thriving. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese took the machines away and destroyed the buildings. After the victory, the mine shafts were demolished by the Communist army, causing a severe coal shortage in various counties of northern Anhui. Now that the area has been recovered and the security situation has gradually stabilized, Zhang Zhengyao and others have raised 30 million yuan to resume operation in order to promote business and facilitate people's livelihood. The coal shortage in northern Anhui should be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>"Demolishing Embankments to Build Dams" Statement Inconsistent with Facts</h3>
<p>Wang Huzhen Explains the Truth</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th] Wang Huzhen, Deputy Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, told our reporter yesterday that the pilot construction of a tide-blocking dam at Chenwengang in Haining County is to prevent the powerful tidal surge in that area. The stones used were from the stones abandoned in the river by the own destroyed Shitang factory, and a part of the stone embankments that were about to collapse, and 10,000 cubic meters of stone embankment were mined from Xiaojianshan. Six Japanese-style ten-wheeled trucks were shipped from Shanghai and ten boats were hired to transport the stones for use in Chenwengang. Construction is scheduled to start on the 24th. The statement that embankments were being demolished to build dams is a misrepresentation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Tax Collection Shortfall Remains Significant - Efforts Underway to Resolve Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] The Suzhou Grain Tax Office invited the press on the morning of the 18th to explain the current status of tax collection and the root causes of the shortage. According to Deputy Director Liu Disheng, the county has collected 140,000 shi of grain, but this is still a very large gap from the quota of 400,000 shi. The main problem is the tenant-landlord dispute. The total area of farmland in the county is 1.8 million mu, of which 70% is managed by landlords. The landlords insist on the established view that the tax should be paid from the rent, and they will only pay the tax after collecting the rent. The tenants, on the other hand, claim that the harvest is poor and are still hesitant despite the implementation of the 25% rent reduction, resulting in a phenomenon of arrears. This is the biggest difficulty for the grain administration. The county government has now established a Tenant-Landlord Mediation Committee to seek coordination between landlords and tenants, which is currently being actively implemented. Another important problem is that the map and household heads are holding back, intending to embezzle the funds. According to investigations by this office, it has been more than two months since the start of the land tax collection, and some grain households have not even received the tax payment notice. This is truly regrettable. Although efforts have been made to prevent the map and household heads from holding back, it is impossible to rely solely on the sixteen grain police officers to distribute the notices, as there are a total of 670,000 grain households in the county. Furthermore, the previous administration was not urgent enough, resulting in missed opportunities. The provincial order originally stipulated that tax collection should begin on September 15th, but it was not followed until November. Now the province requires that the tax be collected in full by the end of January, or severe punishment will be imposed. This office has now stipulated that a late payment penalty will be added to all payments starting from the 16th. Also, due to the previous supply of military grain, the state allowed grain to be collected in both rice and paddy. However, in order to adapt to the environment, it has been purely collecting paddy since the 15th and not accepting brown rice.</p>
<h3>Developing Sanmen Bay</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Reclamation Company to Start First</p>
<p>[Zhenhai News] After the reclamation survey team jointly organized by the provincial government, Zhejiang Reclamation Company, Executive Yuan Zhejiang Office, and Farmers Bank returned from the survey, they unanimously agreed that developing Sanmen Bay is the most important reclamation project in Zhejiang Province and the only good policy to promote the prosperity of the Southeast. The reclaimable area of Sanmen Bay is more than 100,000 mu. The provincial government is currently drafting a report on the survey of the area, which will be submitted to the central government by Chairman Shen to request a large sum of money to start the development. Before receiving the central government's clear order to develop, the Zhejiang Reclamation Company will first develop one of the two areas in the Sanmen Bay reclamation area, Xiaowan Tang and Fenghuangshan Tang. Each of these two areas has an area of more than 3,000 mu. The Zhejiang Reclamation Company has decided to invest 100 million yuan to start construction in March this year.</p>
<h3>Station Manager Takes Over Car and Causes Accident</h3>
<p>Taking Human Life as a Game</p>
<p>Station Manager Takes Over Car and Causes Accident</p>
<p>Twenty-five Passengers Injured</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Haining News] At 1:50 PM on the 16th, a car heading from Ning to Chang'an, near Shaojiaqiao, had the Haining Station Manager Zheng Bengu inside. He seized the driver's seat, insisting on learning to drive the car. The driver and passengers tried to dissuade him to no avail. After two minutes, the car overturned into the pond. Fortunately, the river was shallow, so it did not sink completely, but the car was immersed in the water, and 25 male and female passengers were injured. They immediately negotiated with the station manager of the station. Police officers and the police were notified and immediately detained him. The station manager has now volunteered to pay for medical expenses and luggage losses, but he has not yet been released.</p>
<h3>Longyou Tax Bureau Chief Demands New Year's Gifts from Shops</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Longyou News] As the Lunar New Year season comes to an end, a certain Ye, the business tax section chief of the county tax bureau, privately demanded New Year's gifts from major shops in the city, threatening to increase taxes.

<h3>Executive Yuan Suning Branch's Work Plan for This Year - Zheng Tonghe's Report to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang News] Zheng Tonghe, Director of the Executive Yuan Suning Branch, invited reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai on the 14th to report on the branch's work plan for this year, which is divided into four areas: disaster relief, industrial relief, agricultural reclamation, social welfare:</p>
<p>Disaster Relief</p>
<p>In terms of disaster relief, since the successive recovery of the counties in northern Jiangsu, emergency relief work has been actively carried out. In addition to establishing an office in Huaiyin to handle relief affairs in various counties under Huai, working teams have also been added in Xinghua and Yancheng to handle emergency relief matters in each of these areas. In November and December of last year, about 6,000 tons of food were transported from Zhenjiang to Huaiyin, Huaian, Baoying, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Dongtai, Xinghua, and Taixian counties. 2,500 tons of flour and rice were directly transported from Shanghai to Taixian and Huaiyin Nantong and other counties. Recently, 1,000 tons of soybean flour have been directly transported from Shanghai to Haizhou and 500 tons of flour to Xuzhou for emergency relief. In January and February, a considerable amount of food will continue to be transported to Xuhai and Yanfu counties for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Industrial Relief</p>
<p>In the industrial relief sector, (1) the first phase of the Jiangnan Seawall Project has been fully completed, and the second phase of construction surveying has also been completed and is ready to start. The Yangtze River embankment restoration project has started in six counties: Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Jiangning, Liuhe, and Jiangpu. As of the end of December last year, 360,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. The Northern Jiangsu Canal Project is the responsibility of the Huai River Guidance Committee, and this office has sent engineering auditors to verify the progress of the project and issue public grain. So far, 2,500 cubic meters of stone and 80,000 cubic meters of earth have been extracted. Other projects are also being actively promoted. The Zhenwu Canal Project has been established by the local Zhenwu Canal Engineering Committee to take charge of promoting the project. This office has established the Zhenwu Canal Engineering Office to issue public grain and supervise the construction. Currently, 500 tons of industrial flour has been approved. The Shaoxiang River in Haizhou has begun dredging, and this office has subsidized 200 taels of industrial flour. (2) The provincial highway in Jiangnan has been decided to start construction by the Provincial Highway Bureau, and this office has allocated 350 tons of industrial flour, which has been used to extract stone materials in Kunshan, Wujin, and Zhenjiang. The provincial highway in northern Jiangsu has been decided to first repair the sections from the port to Taixian and from Xiannvmiao to Haian. The 200 tons of industrial flour required have been allocated first, and preparations are being made to start construction. (3) For the repair of primary school buildings, the first phase of subsidies was given to 56 schools, requiring 1,500 tons of flour and soybean flour each, which has already been issued. Each school has raised its own materials to cooperate in the construction. On average, 60% has been completed. The second phase of the plan to subsidize the repair of primary school buildings has also been determined, with 95 schools in Jiangnan and 86 schools in northern Jiangsu, for a total allocation of more than 3,000 tons of flour. The recipient schools in Jiangnan counties have been determined. The situation in northern Jiangsu counties is unclear after the war damage, and it is planned to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections before issuing the subsidies. (4) For the repair of public and private hospital buildings in this area, this office has successively allocated flour to assist, such as the Provincial Zhenjiang Hospital, Wujin Public Hospital, Huaiyin Public Hospital, Gaoyou Public Hospital, Renhui Hospital, Wuxi Public Hospital, Jurong Public Hospital, etc., which are all under construction and repair with flour allocated by this office. As for hospital beds and the necessary equipment and medicines, this branch has successively allocated 1,750 sets to each hospital, and the remaining beds will be allocated after they arrive.</p>
<p>Agricultural Reclamation</p>
<p>In the agricultural reclamation part, in order to facilitate cultivation and increase agricultural production, two types of plans have been drawn up. One is the rice-growing area, using water-drawing machines for irrigation and drainage to restore and increase production. The other is the Huanghuai flooded area, using tractors to restore cultivation and increase production. On the one hand, a request has been submitted to the head office to allocate 1,085 water-drawing machines and 100 tractors for this business. On the other hand, 12 agricultural machinery technicians have been assigned to various places to investigate the agricultural machinery and the environment for its use in order to actively promote it.</p>
<p>Social Welfare</p>
<p>The main businesses in the social welfare sector that are currently being organized include the establishment of sewing factories in Nanjing and Zhenjiang to select strong middle-aged women from the refugees to rush to make cotton clothes and transport them to the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu for distribution. 20,000 cotton clothes have already been made. Congee factories have been established in Zhenjiang, Taizhou, Rugao, Yangzhou, Huaiyin, Xuzhou, Nanjing, and other places, where this office allocates rice to cook porridge to help generally starving refugees. Children's nutrition stations have been established in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, and Taizhou, with a total of 37 stations, and about 15,000 children come to the stations to drink milk every day. Other activities, such as operating affordable cafeterias and assisting charitable organizations, are all being actively promoted according to the planned plan.</p>
<p>Visiting the Sewing Factory</p>
<p>[Zhenjiang News] Zheng Tonghe, Director of the Executive Yuan Suning Branch, hosted reporters in the auditorium of the branch at noon on the 14th to explain the general outline of the work for the 36th year in detail. At 2:00 PM, Wang Guang, director of the relief affairs group, invited reporters to visit the sewing factory organized by the group at the Windmill Mountain in Zhenjiang. The sewing factory is located at the former site of the Rongshi Girls' Middle School, with a beautiful environment and spacious buildings. It was prepared and arranged by the relief affairs group in late October last year and officially started construction on December 2nd. The interior is divided into five departments: cutting cloth room, machine sewing room, hand sewing room, bundling room, and cutting room. There are 27 American sewing machines, five cutting technicians are hired, and 83 female workers. The work is presided over by one administrator, and American experts provide occasional guidance. All the female workers are destitute or refugee women who have been carefully selected and hired. The daily wage is 2,500 yuan, the factory provides lunch every day, and supplements two bags of second-class flour every month. It is reported that the factory can produce more than 10,000 sets of cotton clothes and pants every month. Before the end of last year, 8,000 sets of cotton clothes and pants had been shipped out to provide relief to refugees in the Fuyang area of Huaiyin County.</p>
<h3>Additional Hometown-Return Special Train on the Pukou-Xuzhou Section of the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Mingguang News] In order to facilitate passengers returning home for the Lunar New Year, the Pukou-Xuzhou section of the Jinpu Railway is adding two special express trains every day from January 14th, running between Pukou and Xuzhou. The train departs from Pukou at 10:00 PM every night.</p>
<h3>Scope of Amnesty for Traitor Cases Limited to Harboring Crime and Concealing Illegal Assets - Explanation by Head of Jiangsu High Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] Prosecutor Li Shudong of the Jiangsu High Procuratorate went to the First Prison on the afternoon of the 18th to release a total of thirteen prisoners under amnesty. Our reporter specially visited the heads of the court and procuratorate to inquire about the nature of the crimes of the amnestied prisoners. We were told that those released today were all sentenced by the puppet court, which was declared invalid, and the sentences were retried and met the requirements of the amnesty ordinance. For those who have appealed and are still under trial but have not yet been sentenced, if they meet the amnesty requirements, they should be given a verdict of dismissal and then released. Regarding traitor cases, only those who have violated Article 6 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance for harboring traitors and Article 12 for concealing illegal assets can be pardoned. The rest have no hope of even a reduced sentence. The reporter then inquired with the High Court detention center about the possible number of releases. According to the person in charge, there are currently 200 county prisoners who have appealed on non-traitor charges who may be eligible for amnesty. However, due to the different crimes, a list must be prepared by category and submitted to the high court for approval before they can be released.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] The Wudi Procuratorate continued to pardon and release more than ten criminal offenders, such as opium injuries and family offenses, from the detention center on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Youth League Holds General Verification and Issues Letter to All Members</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 2)</p>
<p>(3) Firmly Uphold Occupational Positions and Participate in Grassroots Construction</p>
<p>During the First National Congress of the Youth League, the League Leader published his own book, "The Destiny of China," instructing young people to strive for the five construction movements and encouraging young people to become engineers, pilots, border reclamation workers, primary school teachers, and township self-government officials. At this Second National Congress, the League Leader further urged us to strive for the five constructions. The Second National Congress declaration also clearly stated that our future work direction should tend towards active construction and should shift from empty political activities to social grassroots service work. These inspirations are awakening a basic understanding among our young comrades: that the reason why our country's past democracy could not be implemented was mainly due to the prevailing concept of becoming officials, and the reason why the people's livelihood could not be implemented was mainly due to the prevailing concept of getting rich. In the future, the country will embark on a new stage of democratic constitutionalism, and the Youth League's organizational and leadership methods should also embark on a new stage, so that young people can participate in actual politics in a democratic way, generated from mass elections, to block the way for individuals to seek official positions, thereby eradicating the group of idlers who do not work for their gain. We must use democratic forces to ensure the thorough implementation of the principle of people's livelihood, to block the way for individuals to speculate and get rich, thereby eradicating the idle capital forces that hinder the normal development of the social economy. If we young people want to make China a modernized country, we must all be determined, determine our career path, pick up our tools, enter farms, factories, mines, and research rooms, engage in actual production and technical work, and directly contribute our bodies, minds, and hands to the great cause of building the country. This great cause will require a very difficult process. Today, we must patiently pick up backward tools, endure the meager rewards of our occupational positions, to lay the initial foundation for national construction. In order to effectively lead young people onto the path of occupational production, we must hold a general verification of League members to check the members of this revolutionary group and determine our new path for organization and leadership.</p>
<p>(4) Establish a Revolutionary Style and Complete the Verification Task</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Youth League reviewed the work of the past eight years and concluded that some passive elements and perfunctory styles still remained in our revolutionary ranks, thereby reducing the League's initiative, revolutionary nature, fighting spirit, and political nature. The existence of this shortcoming is not accidental and must be corrected thoroughly by launching an active self-criticism and mutual criticism movement throughout the League. Therefore, holding a general verification of League members is a kind of active and broad revolutionary education, using this to educate our cadres and comrades to bravely and automatically correct our shortcomings, so that our revolutionary group can continue to progress and constantly generate a lively new force. The goal of our verification is to strengthen the League's revolutionary force, and our verification method must be very objective, working for the benefit of the revolution. We must strictly implement our verification work with the spirit of being willing to do the task and "hating evil as an enemy." Whether cadres or League members, they should deeply recognize this meaning, be diligent and conscientious, and handle the verification carefully. Qualified League members must be re-sworn and register their property to show our loyalty to the ideology and the League Leader, as well as our determination to truly implement unity, serve the country faithfully, and serve the people. To build the country and reform society, we must first start by reforming ourselves. A revolutionary group must have the courage to face all the real shortcomings, and everyone must have the greatest determination, be impartial and unselfish, and correct them at all times. It must be known that tolerance can breed evil, and only by removing corruption can new life be generated. We must awaken the common vigilance of the entire League from top to bottom, thoroughly eliminate all backward thoughts and actions, and all corrupt elements, and establish a revolutionary style, so as to prevent our general verification of League members this time.</p>
<p>Comrades: Although our current revolutionary environment is full of dangers and obstacles, and reactionary forces are still trying to destroy and hinder us, when we recall the adversity of our Founding Father when he was carrying out the revolution, it was many times greater than today. With an indomitable spirit, the Founding Father finally eliminated the reactionary forces and overthrew the Manchu government in the Xinhai Revolution. Later, during the era of the Chinese Revolutionary Party and when the Party was reorganized in the thirteenth year, the Founding Father was able to adapt to the needs of the times and rectify the revolutionary ranks to lead the National Revolution forward. Today, under the wise and great leadership of the League Leader, to continue the revolutionary will of the Founding Father, at a time when the sacred national resistance war has won victory and the democratic constitution has been promulgated, we comrades can confidently overcome all current difficulties and eliminate all reactionary forces to thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People and complete the historical task of revolutionary nation-building.</p>
<p>Dear comrades, now is the best opportunity for us to give full play to our conscience and use the highest wisdom of openness and purity to redouble our efforts to improve the League's affairs. We should join hands, shoulder to shoulder, and actively participate in the general verification and move towards the great road of building the League and building the country. January 15, 36th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Private School Tuition Fee Problems</h3>
<p>Mr. Reporter: Recently, the issue of private schools increasing tuition fees has sparked much discussion. We believe that this is a serious educational problem and should not be judged solely on emotion, nor should all genuinely well-run private school authorities be regarded as "birds of a feather" based on a few isolated examples.</p>
<p>Under the principle of universal education, we hope that all school-age children in the country have the opportunity to receive education. There are 450,000 school-age children in Shanghai, and on average, each school can accommodate 500 students, so 900 national schools should be established. However, due to limited funding, public schools only number 227, accounting for only one-quarter of the need. The remaining three-quarters of school-age children have no choice but to seek placement in private schools. If public schools are overcrowded and private schools cannot operate, most families below the middle class, confined to small rooms with no room to maneuver, will see their lively and active children wandering the streets in groups!</p>
<p>Those familiar with education are aware of the varying levels of private school students and are also concerned about the quality of private school teachers. Many private school principals, in order to hire excellent teachers, have to increase the salaries of teachers to ensure their livelihood. However, tuition income cannot keep up with rising prices, so before the end of the semester, they have to raise funds to provide "living expenses" subsidies for teachers, and even when their own resources are insufficient, they have to seek help from the public. For example, last year's "Respect Teachers Movement" aimed to raise a "Respect Teachers Fund." Although it was criticized by some people at the time, the motivation behind the movement cannot be considered wrong. We absolutely advocate that private school principals, under the principle of economic transparency, do their best to maintain the teachers' living standards and improve their teaching efficiency. In other words, as long as the finances are transparent, how much more tuition the parents increase will allow the teachers to teach with peace of mind and patiently guide their children, and isn't it their own children who will directly benefit? This is much better than raising donations from strangers, using the money to fill the teachers' bellies, and then having them teach your children, isn't it? The Constitution has been promulgated, and the people should have more legal protection, and teachers should also have more job security. We hope that all private school authorities will be able to run schools fairly and share the joys and hardships with the teachers, and re-educate for the rebirth of the country. We absolutely cannot bear to regard the noble "academies" as shops. We hope that the principals who preside over the "academies" will not feel discouraged and disappointed because of the criticism of a few people. I am a police officer who reads your newspaper every day. Last time I read about the adjustment of civil servant salaries, the police, including all expenses, were discounted to 70% or 80%, totaling 155,000 yuan. The authorities understood the situation and, during the Lunar New Year, advanced January's new salary before the 15th of this month for the police officers' New Year expenses. However, so far, the various branches have not received notification orders regarding the increase. I'm afraid that's the case! If we take January's salary first for the New Year expenses, may I ask the fair gentlemen, how can this small amount solve the long-standing financial problems of the police officers? After the Lunar New Year, won't the police have to live? My family has nine members, my parents are almost sixty years old, my younger siblings are still in school, and my poor wife is taking care of three little girls. I earn 111,500 yuan per month. With the current prices soaring like balloons, everything in my house has been sold! We police officers have great responsibilities, protecting the lives and property of the people, and we are not even comparable to the treatment of a little girl working in a factory, who has year-end bonuses, attendance bonuses, and work bonuses, plus an extra month's salary. We are role models for the people, and we are knowledgeable. We do not speak, do not strike, do not slack off, and quietly wait for the authorities to solve our difficulties. Fair gentlemen, please give us police officers some sympathy! (Li Yaoxiang)</p>
<p>The Demarcation of Provinces and Municipalities Should Be Decided Quickly</p>
<p>The problem of demarcating the boundary between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province has been disputed for over a year. This time, the Ministry of Interior sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys with both the province and the city, promising to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The following opinions and wishes are presented:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai is the gateway to the Yangtze River, located in the prosperous region south of the Yangtze River, and is the center of wealth concentration in the country. Its superior conditions are sufficient to help it develop into a world-class metropolis. Dr. Sun Yat-sen foresaw this and formulated the Greater Shanghai Plan. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Executive Yuan also established the boundaries of Shanghai as the foundation for its development. Today, we should follow the original plan and follow the instructions of the visionary to promote the early completion of the plan, rather than delaying the development.</p>
<p>(2) In this World War, the major ports in the Far East, such as Manila, Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, and Singapore, have all suffered serious damage and are difficult to restore. Shanghai has suffered the least damage and is the easiest to recover, so it is more hopeful to develop into a world-class metropolis. The post-war population of the city has increased by one-third compared to before the war, which is clear evidence, and it is still continuing to develop, with unlimited prospects. Therefore, the expansion of the city's area is already urgent. Even without Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Shanghai Plan showing the way, it should be given reasonable expansion to meet the needs of the times.</p>
<p>(3) Neighboring counties, using the maintenance of historical relations as an excuse, refuse to transfer the areas that Shanghai should take over, which is obviously shortsighted and disregards the facts. Moreover, the so-called historical relations are not immutable. Looking at the world's first-class cities, they have all gradually expanded. Therefore, if the Jiangsu Provincial Government insists on its established ideas under the pretext of maintaining historical relations, it will force Shanghai to have no hope of keeping pace with the world's major cities. This is not only detrimental to the development of Shanghai, but also to the interests of the entire country. The Jiangsu Provincial Government should prioritize national interests and abandon its established ideas.</p>
<p>(4) The areas in dispute between the province and the city, in terms of the total area of Jiangsu Province, are like a drop in the bucket, which does not affect the overall situation, but it is indispensable to the development of Shanghai and is of great benefit. Moreover, both belonging to the province and belonging to the city are under the central government, so the Jiangsu Provincial Government has no need to insist on not letting go.</p>
<p>(5) The living habits of the people in the disputed areas have long been completely assimilated with Shanghai due to the rapid development of transportation, and they are alienated from the original county governments. Therefore, in terms of the people's living habits, the scope of Shanghai should also be expanded to meet the trend of natural circumstances.</p>
<p>(6) Taking Qibao Town as an example, it was originally under the jurisdiction of Shangsong and Qing counties, which led to the inability to unify administration. For hundreds of years, the suffering of the people has been countless. Therefore, it is even more necessary to adjust the affiliation and completely incorporate it into Shanghai to achieve the unity of the entire town.</p>
<p>(7) Since the victory, all the Baotian organizations, health institutions, and educational undertakings in Shanghai, Qibao, and Xinzhuang have been gradually established by Shanghai. If they are still ordered to be returned to Jiangsu Province, there will inevitably be disturbances again. Changes in orders will leave the people at a loss. In order to maintain the government's prestige, it should not be changed again.</p>
<p>(8) In the past, the boundary lines between the province and the city were unclear, which often caused disputes. If the boundary line set in the 16th year of the Republic of China is used as the standard (the Xiaolai River in the west is the boundary between the province and the city), it will not only conform to the principle of using natural boundary lines as the boundary demarcation, but also make the boundary lines between the province and the city more neat and clear, which will be of great benefit to the future implementation of administration.</p>
<p>In addition to jointly requesting the Ministry of Interior to order the provincial and municipal authorities to transfer the areas, we beg to disclose the above points to show the public's sentiments.</p>
<p>Request for Road Repair on Xiangde Road</p>
<p>The road surface of Xiangde Road has always been a coal and bamboo road. It has not been repaired for more than ten years, and it has been frequently traversed by ten-wheeled trucks, forming large and small potholes. After it rains, the road becomes a swamp, with no place to put your feet. Most of the residents living on the road are engaged in business and do not understand the procedures, so they specially request your newspaper to publish this, so that the Public Works Bureau can be informed and carry out repairs. If the cost of building the road is too high, the sidewalk can be filled in. Even if it costs a little money, the residents are willing to contribute. The rainy season is approaching soon, and we also beg the Public Works Bureau to order the authorities to handle it as soon as possible, which is what the residents are looking forward to day and night.

<h3>Vice Ministers of the Four Powers Draft the German Peace Treaty; The Soviet Union Proposes Four Suggestions; Resolving the Reparations Issue Will Be the Most Difficult; Britain and France Advocate Establishing a German Central Government</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] The vice ministers of the four powers began drafting the peace treaty with Germany this afternoon. First, they determined the order in which the governments of the Allied nations would be present to present their opinions. Then, they discussed the instructions given by the four foreign ministers to their vice ministers, especially the instructions on procedural matters. The Soviet representative, Gusev, proposed the following four suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Determine the content of the draft treaty for submission to the Moscow meeting of the four foreign ministers for discussion. (2) Consult with the other Allied nations. (3) All countries that actively participated in the war against Germany should be allowed to participate in the review of the peace treaty. (4) Regarding the final drafting of the peace treaty and its implementation after signing. The representatives welcomed Gusev's suggestions, but the French representative, M. de Merville, insisted that the cooperation of the Allied nations should be closer to avoid errors and delays. Today's meeting was quite optimistic due to the Soviet representative's relaxed attitude. It is now scheduled to continue discussing the Austrian peace treaty on the 20th and the German peace treaty on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The timetable for the four foreign ministers' representatives' meeting on the German issue to listen to the opinions of the representatives of small countries has been revised as follows: Australia, January 23rd; Yugoslavia, 24th; Canada, 25th; Poland, 27th; South Africa, 28th; Belgium, 29th. The representatives of the four powers analyzed the following issues this afternoon for discussion: (1) The drafting plan to be adopted by the foreign ministers' meeting, (2) The method of the foreign ministers' meeting to seek the opinions of the Allied governments, (3) The method of discussing the draft treaty with the Allied governments, (4) The procedure for the final stage of drafting.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] British sources predicted today that the Soviet Union will borrow $5 billion from the United States as a price for reducing its demands for reparations from Germany. The most difficult issue for the foreign ministers' representatives when drafting the German and Austrian peace treaties is the reparations issue. According to The Economist magazine, the Soviet Union has demanded $10 billion in reparations from Germany, but obtaining half of that amount now would be of greater economic value than obtaining the full amount.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] The British representative suggested at the four foreign ministers' meeting today that the organization of a temporary German government should be discussed immediately so that an agreement on the administration of Germany could be reached before the final peace treaty is signed. The Soviet representative, Gusev, replied to this suggestion: I do not have the authority to discuss this issue at the four vice ministers' meeting and should submit it to the Moscow meeting of the four foreign ministers for discussion. The French representative hinted that he would like the four powers to first reach an agreement on the establishment of a German central government, and then sign the final peace treaty with it. It is reported that Yugoslavia's demand for 1,200 square miles of territory in Austrian Carinthia surprised Britain and the United States because it was three times greater than expected.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] The four foreign ministers' representatives' meeting has decided that the Austrian peace treaty should clearly stipulate that it cannot be merged with Germany. The representatives have also agreed to recognize Austria as an independent country, but they want it to ensure a democratic government and ensure that its people enjoy various basic human rights. An agreement has been reached on the preamble to the Austrian peace treaty. Its content does not praise or criticize Austria, but briefly describes its history, pointing out that it was once controlled by Germany, thereby reducing its war responsibility. The representatives also agreed that the main text of the Austrian treaty should be divided into three chapters: political, military, and economic. The draft of the political chapter should be submitted for discussion next Monday. The Soviet representative stated that the Soviet government may not intend to issue a draft of the Austrian treaty and will express its opinions when discussing the drafts submitted by other powers. The representatives also decided not to circulate all documents to small countries, but only to provide them to a country when it requests to see them. As for the invitation to small countries to present their opinions, it can be sent out this weekend, and their representatives will be notified by telephone when they are invited to attend.</p>
<h3>Our Government Requests to Retain Due Rights in the German Peace Treaty</h3>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Meeting Announces Text of Five-Nation Peace Treaties; Byrnes Scheduled to Sign Tomorrow; Formal Signing Ceremony to Be Held in Paris Next Month</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The four foreign ministers' meeting announced today the final text of the first batch of peace treaties of World War II, namely the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. Its content (see this newspaper on October 15th of last year) is the same as that disclosed during the negotiations in Paris and New York and has no new features. Each peace treaty is printed in English, French, and Russian translations, totaling 781 pages.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Outgoing Secretary of State Byrnes is scheduled to sign the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania on Monday morning. This may be the last official business he conducts before handing over diplomatic affairs to Marshall. Incoming Secretary of State Marshall is still staying in Hawaii. Everything here has been arranged to prepare for his flight here at the end of this week. As soon as Byrnes signs the peace treaties, he will be sworn into office. The Finnish peace treaty does not require Byrnes' signature because the United States did not declare war on that country. After signing here, the peace treaties of each country must be sent to London and Moscow for signature by British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and then sent to Paris for signature by other relevant countries, and it is scheduled to be signed on February 10 by the five former enemy countries of Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Italian Fleet Specified in Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The State Department today announced the annexes to the Italian peace treaty, revealing for the first time the details of the distribution of the Italian fleet. The names of the ships had been kept secret to prevent the crew from deliberately sabotaging them. Authorities believe that the list of ships was finalized by the Naval Committee of the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference. The committee still needs to consult with the governments of the four powers to determine which ship should be handed over to which of the four powers. If this issue cannot be resolved by the Naval Committee or through diplomatic channels, it may be discussed again at the Moscow meeting of the four foreign ministers. The signing of the Italian peace treaty will not be affected by the distribution of Italian ships by the four powers. According to the annexes, Italy will lose three battleships, five cruisers, seven destroyers, six torpedo boats, eight submarines, and one sloop. The remaining ships can be retained by Italy. The three lost battleships are the "Caesar," "Italy," and "Vittorio Veneto." The lost cruisers are the "Savoy," "Brindisi," "Garibaldi," "Montecuccoli," and "Caduna."</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States to Issue Joint Announcement Raising German Industrial Standards; Taking Unified Action to Deal with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 17th] British and American occupation authorities stated today that they will issue a notice to Germans in the British and American occupation zones within days, stipulating that German industry should be allowed to exceed the previous four-power agreement so that Germany's economic center of gravity can be shifted from traditional heavy industry to light industry and textiles. This joint action by Britain and the United States is to deal with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had told representatives of the pro-Soviet German Socialist Party that the industry in the Soviet occupation zone would increase by 200% to 300%, that the Soviet occupation zone would stop dismantling factories as reparations, and that the current reparations for German products would also be reduced.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 18th] Soviet military commander in Berlin, Kotikov, today canceled the order for individual identity verification within Berlin. The previous order was intended to search for missing war criminals and soldiers who had not officially taken leave of absence. Kotikov explained the reason for this move, fearing that it would hinder Berlin's social activities this winter. However, it is widely believed that the real purpose of this move is to prevent the German police under the authority of the four powers from forcibly sending people from Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic states back to their countries.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, aboard the warship "Mount Olympus" in the Arctic Ocean, 17th] The reconnaissance team of the U.S. Navy Antarctic Expedition landed on the south side of Antarctic Ice Horn today to study strategies for overcoming ice ridges and opening a road to the Little America base. The group, including ice-breaking experts, was transported to Whale Bay by the icebreaker "Northwind," while three other ships anchored outside. The ice-breaking experts will study methods for filling the ice surface to facilitate the loading and unloading of two 7,000-ton cargo ships. The only convenience for the expedition team is that the surface of the ice rock is smooth, and the construction of supports will not be too difficult. It is now planned to set up tents on the ice rock to accommodate the engineering team. The expedition team may have to be trapped by the ice. At that time, the floating ice can solidify as hard as cement.</p>

<h3>American and French Rule of Law: Mrs. Roosevelt's Driver's License Revoked Without Complaint</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] Mrs. Roosevelt's driver's license has recently been revoked by the state of New York. She was involved in a car accident last August in which five people were injured, including herself. This incident proves that in the United States, even the former First Lady is not above the law. Mrs. Roosevelt has no complaints about the state government's decision. In her daily column, she stated that although she is familiar with driving, she has no intention of making any special requests. She believes that those who cause accidents while driving should accept the consequences.</p>

However, British officials believe that no action can be taken until after the general election in Burma in April of this year.</p>
<h3>Viewing Allied-Occupied Japan Through the Eyes of a Briton (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Original by John Morris, Translated by Zhang Deqian</p>
<p>(II) Two Tasks</p>
<p>To assess the achievements of the first year of the occupation, it is necessary to understand the purpose of the occupation. In my view, the occupation forces have two main tasks. First, to eliminate Japan's war potential, both real and potential, to prevent her from harming us again in the future. Second, to permanently eliminate the Japanese people's will to disrupt world peace. Naturally, these two objectives are complementary in a sense, especially the second, which is the root of many other problems and is obviously more important.</p>
<p>Military Power No Longer Exists</p>
<p>Japan's military power has been largely destroyed and is no longer a threat to us. Acres of ruined factories are evidence of this. Moreover, Japan now has neither an army nor a navy, and most of her merchant ships were sunk before the end of the war. Today's Japan seems similar to Germany after the end of World War I, but in fact, it is not comparable. Germany had thousands of miles of land borders and sufficient domestic raw materials to supply the heavy industries necessary for war. Once the occupation ended, nothing could stop Germany from rearming. Furthermore, the destruction and disruption of German industrial resources in World War I were insignificant by today's standards; in other words, although the Allies were victorious, Germany's war potential was not destroyed at all.</p>
<p>As for Japan today, her territory has been reduced to four main contiguous islands, the so-called Japanese mainland. She now has neither an army nor a navy, and all strategic bases in the Pacific are in the hands of the Allies, making it easy for the Allies to control all domestic activities in Japan. Another point to note is that Japan's heavy industry relies entirely on imports. She produces very little iron domestically, which is useless for manufacturing high-grade steel, and Japan's coal is only sufficient for domestic use. Therefore, we can believe that the first objective of the occupation of Japan (i.e., destroying Japan's war potential), even if not yet completed, is not far from completion. Of course, Japan will not be able to obtain the necessary materials and equipment to engage in atomic research.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the second, longer-term, and more important task of occupying Japan. It is somewhat difficult to assess the progress of this task here, because there is no suitable standard to measure whether the progress is fast or slow. So I just want to report the facts and let the readers make their own judgments.</p>
<p>Stubborn Mindset Difficult to Change</p>
<p>I lived in Japan for six months this time and spoke with hundreds of Japanese people from all walks of life. I never noticed that they had the slightest intention of admitting their mistakes. Most people's attitudes are the same as before the war. Several times I even wondered if this war had ever happened, because in certain strata of Japanese society (especially senior civil servants), mentioning the war seems to be a breach of etiquette. However, most Japanese people have realized their defeat, but at the same time, they believe that their leaders' fault was not in doing the wrong thing, but in not doing it well. Everyone is talking about the newly discovered democracy, but I have never met a Japanese person who can give a satisfactory definition of democracy. Now all Japanese people are willing and hope to engage in democracy, but most Japanese people are obviously just engaging in it, with little fundamental change in their thinking. Only among intellectuals and students are there people who truly hope for drastic changes.</p>
<p>To destroy Japan's war will, in my opinion, is fundamentally a long-term educational problem. But before discussing this issue in detail, we must first outline its economic and political implications, because they are directly related to the solution of the entire educational problem.</p>
<p>Allied Unity is of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>We seem to have to restore the Japanese economy to a considerable extent to prevent her from becoming a burden to the Allies. The main difficulty lies in deciding how Japan's industry should be reorganized so that it can no longer be used for war. The organization of Japanese industry must be based on the interests of the Allies and the world. We have made some progress in this area, but this progress has been hampered by the instability of the general world situation and the apparent conflicts of interest of the countries concerned. The most obvious examples are food policy and the issue of reparations. Almost every Allied conference held in Tokyo discovers several new difficulties. If it were not for the fundamentally different ideologies that exist between the three major powers and the Soviet Union, most of these difficulties would be easily resolved.</p>
<p>In addition to the increasingly obvious ideological conflicts, there is also a less obvious competition for permanent political influence. In this competition, only the Americans can proceed smoothly. Ideological issues are even more important in the reorganization of Japan's political and social system. Within this scope, the least real progress is worth recording. Japan's social and political reorganization will inevitably develop according to the American model, and as a result, the influence of other countries must be reduced proportionally.</p>

<h3>Collision at Wusong Estuary at Midnight: Zhi Jiang Sinks: Slight Casualties Among More Than 800 Passengers</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Zhi Jiang, a ship on the Shanghai route of the Tongji Shipping Company, departed from Shanghai at 9:00 p.m. on the 17th, fully loaded with passengers. When the ship arrived at the Wusong Estuary, it collided with the Hua Tong, an iron barge of the Gongyi Tugboat Company, in the dark. The Zhi Jiang was an old wooden-hulled ship. After the collision, the hull immediately ruptured and gradually sank. There were more than 800 passengers on board. At the time of the accident, people were shouting for help. Fortunately, many small iron boats specializing in rescue near the Wusong Estuary rushed to the scene of the accident and immediately carried out rescue operations. By about 4:00 a.m., more than 700 people had been rescued. It is reported that there were still several bodies in the lower hold of the Zhi Jiang. According to eyewitnesses at the scene, many male and female passengers were knocked into the Huangpu River, and their bodies were carried away by the waves. However, the exact number of deaths is currently unknown. After the incident, the water police authorities took Wang Lexing, the second mate of the Zhi Jiang (Tongji Shipping Company), and Zhang Jinsheng, the owner of the Hua Tong, into custody for questioning. According to Wang Lexing, a native of Fenghua who lives at No. 44, Lane 393, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, the Zhi Jiang was carrying more than 800 passengers. The Hua Tong was an empty ship entering the port. When the accident occurred, I pulled the horn twice, but the Hua Tong did not have a mast light and did not honk back. Moreover, there were iron barges on both sides, making it difficult to avoid the collision, so the accident occurred. Zhang Jinsheng claimed that the Hua Tong was entering the port according to regulations, sailing close to the stone embankment. Because the Zhi Jiang wanted to cross in front of my ship, it was hit in the middle. Although the Zhi Jiang had pulled its whistle, it was too late to avoid the collision.</p>
<h3>Child Rescued and Revived</h3>
<p>It is also learned that most of the passengers on the Zhi Jiang this time were small merchants. Many items were salvaged from the ship, including a military blanket, a bag of tin foil, a silk cotton robe, a cloth gown, checkered shirt and pants, three torn cotton quilts, several pairs of socks, nineteen children's hats, a bed sheet, fifty-three packs of cigarettes, two cans of biscuits, a gray blanket, a wooden box, a pair of children's rubber shoes, a pair of casual shoes, and 100,000 yuan in legal tender. These goods are temporarily stored at the water police substation and will be transferred to the branch office for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Also, during the rescue operation until about 4:00 a.m. at dawn, most of the passengers had been rescued. At that time, police officer Xu Yinguang, No. 10147, suddenly heard knocking sounds from the ship's hatch. He then kicked away the window board with force and discovered a child of fourteen or fifteen years old (surname unknown, from Taixing). At that time, the water had already submerged his head and neck, and his life was hanging by a thread. So he was rescued and revived.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the injured passengers of the Zhi Jiang were sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. There were two seriously injured and five slightly injured. Among them, Yang Yan, Tanaka Nan, Cao Cangzheng, Chen Jinglin, and Wang Zhaoyue were discharged from the hospital after being bandaged. One of the seriously injured, Cai Zhilin, died before reaching the hospital. The other, Zhou Haigen, was still in critical condition due to his injuries. It is reported that Zhou is forty-four years old and a native of Taixing. He and the deceased Cai Zhilin were originally relatives and came to Shanghai to purchase goods for the New Year. The two fell into the water when the accident happened the night before, and were rescued by people. However, due to drinking too much water and being injured by an iron hook during the rescue, Cai died of his injuries before reaching the hospital.</p>
<h3>Director of the Navigation Administration Speaks</h3>
<p>According to Li Gufan, Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration, the responsibility for the Zhi Jiang accident is still under investigation. However, the Navigation Administration's limit for the number of passengers on the Zhi Jiang was 357 people. It is now learned that the ship was carrying more than twice that number of passengers. Therefore, the Tongji Company authorities should bear full responsibility for this accident. In addition to sending personnel to the scene of the accident with the company's personnel to conduct a detailed investigation, the company authorities have been ordered to report the details of the accident to the Navigation Administration. The Navigation Administration has also ordered the Tongji Company to properly handle the aftermath and, in the short term, discuss and decide on the compensation for the dead and injured passengers of the Zhi Jiang and the loss of property. Li also said that the Navigation Administration has always been very strict in its inspection of wooden-hulled ships before sailing. After this accident, the inspection standards will be further raised, and the operation of wooden-hulled ships will be gradually banned to reduce the occurrence of such unfortunate incidents.</p>
<p>It is reported that the ticket sales this time were all handled by the Universal Transportation Company. The Tongji Company authorities did not know in advance that there were so many passengers. Therefore, the Universal Transportation Company is also responsible for the accident this time. Also, some of the passengers who were rescued yesterday have been sent back to Shanghai by the Tongji Company by car. These passengers immediately went to the Tongji Company in the Cishu Building to demand a refund of their tickets, causing disturbances.</p>
<h3>Rushing Home, a Huge Crowd at the North Station</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Lunar New Year is approaching, and people from other places who are living in Shanghai are busy going home for the New Year. The "North Station" is crowded with people and you can't even breathe. As soon as the train takes away a thousand, two thousand more passengers pour in. In recent days, the ticket office at the North Station has sold as many as 16,472 tickets for the Beijing-Shanghai line on the busiest day, and 6,099 tickets for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Adding in the tickets sold by the Sichuan North Road Business Office and the China Travel Service, there are a total of 30,000 tickets. Imagine 30,000 people crowding at the North Station to take the train, how can it not be crowded? There are also about 20,000 passengers coming to Shanghai from other places.</p>
<p>In order to enable workers' groups to return home, the Railway Bureau has added the Shanghai-Zhenjiang fourth-class train (ticket price is 3,000 yuan) and the Shanghai-Changzhou fourth-class train (ticket price is 2,500 yuan) since the 8th of this month. At the same time, all work units have added "double shifts" to meet urgent needs. Tong Shida, the general station master of the North Station, has been staying in the station every night recently. It is really not easy to spend the Lunar New Year in the North Station!</p>
<h3>Methods for Ordering Sleeper Tickets</h3>
<p>Also, since the continuous plane crashes, passengers have changed to taking trains one after another. Therefore, the sleeper cars on both lines are in great demand. The bureau has recently formulated methods for ordering sleeper tickets to show restrictions: (1) Central Committee members, ministers and officials of various ministries and commissions, and social elites. (2) Diplomatic envoys from various countries, senior military officials, and consular officials. (3) Leading officials of major state-owned institutions, leaders of industry, commerce, and academia in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai National Guard Training Planned by Civil Affairs Department; Preliminary Work to Survey Robust Men First</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the city, made a statement to the reporters of the East China News Agency yesterday regarding the issue of National Guard training in this city: It is said that the National Guard training in this city is the most basic task of cultivating military service and is completely different from the nature of conscription. The department is now planning and preparing to carry it out. However, the jurisdiction of the National Guard is also the responsibility of the Military Region Command. At present, the barracks of the department have not yet been selected, so the National Guard training is temporarily difficult to promote. The department plans to set up a military affairs section to handle the National Guard training. The person in charge must be a military expert who has received advanced military training. The candidates have not yet been determined. As for the preliminary work of training the National Guard, we will first start by surveying robust men. It is estimated that there are more than 1.4 million citizens in this city who are of the age of qualified robust men. All qualified robust men have the obligation to receive National Guard training. As for the starting time of the training work, it still needs to be summoned by the order of the Military Region Command. However, the difficulty is the difficulty in solving the training venue (i.e., the barracks), and the budget also needs to be reviewed and decided by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the training class for the Baojia personnel planned by the department was originally suspected of using the Zhengshi Middle School building. Now, as the school is preparing for the enrollment and opening of the next semester, the location of the class has become a problem and is currently in a high tide.</p>

<h3>Wives and Concubines Compete to Buy Diamond Rings, Husband Angered and Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Shao Guoliang, a 36-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 4, Lane 135, Jinling Middle Road, is known for his love of women. He has a wife and a concubine, living together in the same house. He has considerable savings and enjoys a wealthy life. Recently, as the end of the year approaches, his concubine requested that her husband buy her a diamond ring. The legal wife learned of this and also wanted one. As a result, quarrels erupted between the wife and concubine, even leading to physical altercations. Shao tried to mediate, but the two women argued even more fiercely. Shao Guoliang found himself in a dilemma and, out of anger, suddenly had thoughts of ending his life at 9:30 PM the day before yesterday. He ingested Lysol in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, his family discovered him and immediately hired a car to take him to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. He was resuscitated and survived. The police later learned of the incident and reported the case.</p>

<h3>Bearskin Coat, High Heels: Modern Girl Smokes Heroin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Taishan Police Precinct, along with several volunteer police officers, patrolled a room in the Anshang Hotel on Yunnan South Road, near the West Xinqiao Street, at around 10 PM the night before last. They found a modern girl wearing a white bearskin coat, fashionable perm, and high-heeled leather shoes, holding a package of morphine, about to smoke it. The volunteer police officers rushed in and apprehended her. She identified herself as Li Meili, 26 years old, from Suzhou. She used to dance at the Lido Ballroom. She recently came to Shanghai from Suzhou. She claimed that she obtained the heroin from a "little sister" at the kitchen shed at No. 32, Yinyu Lane, for her own use, because she suffers from stomach problems and cannot relieve the pain without smoking morphine. The volunteer police officers then went to the kitchen shed at No. 32, Yinyu Lane, Liulin Road, and apprehended a woman named Cao Lili, her lover Wang Changshan, and Cao's sister, Zhang Cao氏. Two packages of heroin were found on Wang. Along with more than ten suspects, including Zhong Xueli, they were all taken to the police station.

Li and the other three were sent to the court for trial, while the rest were released on bail.</p>
<h3>Pedicab Companies Seek New Licenses, City Government Thoroughly Investigates Illegal Activities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to traffic congestion in the city, the municipal government announced in May of last year that the issuance of new pedicab licenses would be suspended to gradually eliminate them. However, pedicab drivers, concerned about their livelihoods, repeatedly petitioned the municipal government and the Municipal Council for new licenses, without success. Now, the Vehicle Affairs Office of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has learned that the pedicab industry association in the city has been actively lobbying for new licenses and held an emergency meeting on the 17th at the Youning Automobile Company in the city. Representatives from various pedicab companies in the city attended. The person in charge reported on their activities, claiming that new licenses could be obtained if each company paid an "activity fee" of 10,000 yuan per license. It was also learned that the number of companies registered at the time and the number of licenses they were seeking were as follows: Fuji 60, Sanda 50, Lübao 60, International 20, Tianfei 200, Yongfeng 150, Rongguang 340, Samsung 150, Tongyi 400, Hexing 100, Yunzhen 100, Gongxing 100, Lisheng 150, Dadong 200, Daxin 200, Pingan 20, Employees' Cooperative 200, Youlian 200, Youning 200, Yunfei 200. A total of 2,770 licenses, requiring 25 million yuan for "activity fees." The municipal government is currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Unlicensed Automobiles: Strict Enforcement</p>
<p>Recently, unlicensed automobiles have often been seen traveling on the streets of the city. These vehicles were purchased from abroad and may only have foreign licenses or have already obtained domestic licenses, but the foreign licenses have not been removed. In addition to urging the traffic police to pay more attention, the Public Utilities Bureau specifically requests the public's assistance. If you encounter an automobile without a domestic license, immediately notify the nearby traffic police to stop it. If there are two license plates displayed at the same time, please record the number of the "foreign" license and directly notify the Military Affairs Office of the Public Utilities Bureau on Hankou Road. The office will then notify the vehicle owner based on the local license number and ask them to immediately remove the foreign license.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Municipal Rickshaw Industry Association sent a telegram yesterday to Mayor Wu and the Municipal Council, requesting that unlicensed pedicabs and rickshaws, as well as pedicabs and rickshaws from Baoshan and Jiading counties, be banned, and that the issuance of licenses for double-seated pedicabs be suspended to alleviate traffic congestion in the city.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Detained as Suspects in Murder of Nanny</h3>
<p>Jiang Yaocai, owner of a paper shop at No. 14, Lane 68, was the employer of the murdered Li Ma. The nanny Li Ma was found dead on the morning of the 11th of this month. The Taishan Police Precinct dispatched Zhang Jiayu and police officer Wang Dongwan to the scene to investigate. Two suspects, Dong A'chu and Sun A'er, have been detained in connection with the case. The deceased, Li Gao A'bao, 26 years old, from Gaoyou, Jiangbei, married Li Sang, also known as Youde, four years ago in their hometown. The couple came to Shanghai last May. Youde, now residing at No. 419, Yangzhou Road, is unemployed. Due to disagreements with the deceased, the deceased left home and worked as a nanny at Zhengtai Coal Company at the southern end of Jianguo East Road. Later, because of improper behavior, the deceased was dismissed. In December of last year, she was introduced by Sun A'er, a rickshaw puller for Dr. Huang Peixin at No. 38, Shuxiang Lane, Xinping Lane, Shunchang Road, to work as a nanny for the Jiang family.</p>
<p>After the murder, the Taishan Police Precinct dispatched officers to the Jiang family to investigate. They found that the deceased had indeed been strangled to death with a hemp rope. 188,700 legal tender, a pair of gold earrings, and a note with the words "Tong A'fu telephone 81216" were found in the deceased's pocket. There were no other clues to be found. The deceased slept every night in a small room under the staircase behind the living room. The doors in the front and back were tightly locked, so it was speculated that the murder took place late at night. According to Chai Huanchu, a resident of No. 15 next door, at around 7 PM, a man in his twenties wearing a felt hat and a yellow raincoat lightly knocked on the back door of No. 14 with his left index finger. When no one opened the door, he left. At around 8 PM, another man with short black hair and wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and pants was seen talking to the deceased.</p>
<p>The telephone number 81216 was traced to Bi Liangcai at No. 3, Lane 45, Taicang Road. When questioned, it was found that a rickshaw puller named Dong A'chu was out and had not returned home. Later, he was apprehended in front of the Huanqiu Dyeing and Weaving Factory on the road to the South City Police Department. Dong A'chu, 34 years old, from Gaoyou, stated that he knew the deceased through the introduction of Zhang A'bao, the nanny of Huang Jinpei's family. He had visited the Jiang family about four times, but vehemently denied having any improper relations with the deceased. He also went to the Jiang family at 8 PM on the 11th to ask if A'bao's new cotton robe had been made, and then left. He returned home to sleep at 11 PM and claimed to have no knowledge of the cause of the deceased's death. The original introducer, Sun A'er, 27 years old, from Gaoyou, residing at No. 3, Kangti Lane, Jianguo East Road, stated that he had known the deceased for some time and had visited her six times to inquire about her husband's whereabouts. He also went there at 7 PM on the 11th and left soon after to pull his rickshaw, returning home at 7:30 PM in the evening. He denied having any affair with the deceased and also did not know the cause of her death. The case was transferred to the prosecutor's office for further investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Tax Bureau Clarifies Handling of Estate Tax Violations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance previously submitted a request to the Direct Tax Administration for instructions on how to handle cases where estate tax payers violate Article 9 of the Estate Tax Law.</p>
<p>The Administration issued an order stating, "If the heirs of an estate have disposed of property without paying estate tax and without providing a guarantee, the court should be requested to seize the heirs' other undisposed property. If the heirs have no other property that can be seized, the court should be promptly requested to pursue the unpaid taxes rigorously to prevent evasion." The Bureau has instructed the relevant departments to comply and has notified its subordinates accordingly.</p>
<p>Car Collision on Middle Zheng West Road</p>

<h3>Garbage Trucks Transporting Vegetables: Health Bureau Actively Cracks Down, 16th Wharf Dispatches Investigators</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the matter of sanitation workers using garbage trucks to transport vegetables for profit, the Health Bureau has recently been actively investigating. Director Zhang and Director Qi of the Environmental Sanitation Department of the Health Bureau have been personally going to the vegetable markets around 16th Wharf at 3 AM every day to check for garbage trucks carrying vegetables. It is reported that one case was found some days ago, and the driver's license was revoked. The practice has reportedly disappeared in recent days, but the Health Bureau will continue to dispatch personnel to 16th Wharf for investigation to thoroughly eliminate it.</p>
<p>The practice of garbage trucks carrying vegetables stems from the poor living conditions of sanitation workers, who want to use public vehicles to profit. Director Qi told reporters yesterday that the basic salary of sanitation workers in the city is 35 yuan, which, multiplied by the civil servant's price index of 1,100 times, is approximately 38,500 yuan, plus a subsidy of 102,000 yuan, for a total monthly income of only 140,500 yuan. The more than 3,000 sanitation workers in the city are all struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<h3>Notorious Thief Released on Amnesty, Robs Movie Star's Home Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Xue Huaming, a notorious thief who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, was released after two amnesties. However, shortly after his release, he relapsed and, on December 6th of last year at 6 PM, together with two fugitive accomplices, falsely claimed to be reporters from the Mainland Publishing House and went to the home of movie star Fenghuang at No. 7, No. 150, Jianguo West Road. They gained entry under the pretext of an interview and then pulled out guns and threatened them not to make a sound. They then tied up the maid Wang Du氏 and Fenghuang's mother, Yan Guan氏, and proceeded to loot the house. They stole a gold bracelet, a diamond ring with four diamonds, two gold rings, and seven bed sheets, worth over one million yuan. Before leaving, they warned the victims not to call the police. Some days ago, the Laozha Patrol Team of the Police Precinct was checking pedestrians in front of the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road when Xue attempted to rob a store with a weapon. He was apprehended by the police officers, who found a Mauser pistol with eight bullets on his person. After being taken to the station for interrogation, he confessed to the previous robbery. The case will be investigated soon and transferred to the Garrison Command for trial according to law.</p>

<h3>Shen Shihhao Under Interrogation, Claims He Was Not An Enemy Agent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday interrogated Shen Shihhao, a suspected traitor. The defendant is a native of Ningbo. He is accused of having served as an inspector at the puppet Ning Shao Nitre Mine Bureau, a secret agent for the Ningbo enemy Gendarmerie, and a staff officer for the puppet Garrison Forces on Zhoushan Island. He was arrested by the Ningbo Police Bureau for selling handguns. The defendant claimed that he only worked as an inspector at the nitre mine for three months, did not serve as a secret agent for the enemy Gendarmerie, and did not serve as a staff officer for the puppet Garrison Forces on Zhoushan Island. He needed a pass at the time, so he asked Shen Ping, a staff officer in that unit, to make one for him, and he casually filled in the staff officer title. He claimed that the handgun was given to him by Zhou Ming. The court asked where Zhou Ming currently lived, but the defendant said he did not know. The court ordered a retrial at a later date and remanded the defendant in custody.</p>

<h3>Cigarette Factory Postpones Year-End Bonus, Workers Destroy Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Luxin Cigarette Factory at No. 1, Lane 124, Jianguo East Road, has over 800 male and female workers. Due to the large-scale dumping of American cigarettes, the factory's operations have been affected, and it is experiencing financial difficulties, so the workers' monthly wages are often not paid on time. On the 8th of this month, the workers demanded a year-end bonus from the factory, equivalent to one month's salary for each year of service. After mediation by the Social Bureau, the factory agreed to pay the bonus on the 15th, but it was postponed for two days. Then, on the 17th, it was said that it would be postponed again until noon on the 18th, and a notice was posted stating that if the bonus was not paid by that time, the factory would not be responsible for any accidents that occurred to the workers. This notice was jointly certified by Secretary Fan of the factory, Section Chief Bao of the Taishan Police Precinct's Judicial Section, and Mr. Sha of the Social Bureau. When noon arrived yesterday, the factory still had not paid the bonus, so the workers partially destroyed the office. The factory then reported to the Social Bureau, accusing the workers of damaging property and intending to cancel the year-end bonus. The workers refused, so they requested the Social Bureau to mediate again. Because the factory representative did not arrive, the discussion was postponed until today.</p>
<h3>Four Workers Arrested for Demanding Year-End Bonus at Sanxing Flour Mill</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Sanxing Flour Mill in the city has been transferred to new owners because the factory owner did not intend to continue operating it. The outer-class workers (those who transport flour on the docks) recently demanded maintenance fees and a year-end bonus from the factory. The factory refused, and the Social Bureau was asked to mediate. The Social Bureau ruled that the outer-class workers were not formal employees of the factory and therefore were not entitled to payment. Yesterday morning at 11 AM, 47 of the outer-class workers, along with the former factory owner, went to the Social Bureau and surrounded the Third Division, shouting and making a scene for three hours. Until 2 PM, the Taishan Police Precinct sent police to the scene and arrested foreman Yang Chunqing and workers Meng Dekuan, Ling Yuanqing, and Qian Zeyi. The rest scattered.</p>
<h3>Laid-off Workers Demand Reinstatement</h3>

Zhou and the others have repeatedly requested the factory to reinstate them, but without success. The Social Bureau is currently mediating the matter, and it is reported that the factory has agreed to give them priority in hiring.</p>
<h3>Dismissal at Royal Cafe Resolved After Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Royal Cafe on Jing'an Temple Road announced its closure due to sluggish business and inability to sustain operations. The 25 employees demanded severance pay from the employer.

(2) The employees' debts to the employer will be deducted from their severance pay. (3) The employer's debt to the employees for additional small accounts will be cleared by the end of the year.

<h3>Wulan Ting Critically Ill; Unable to Eat, Abdomen Swollen Like a Drum; Life Sustained by Plasma and Saline Solution Alone</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wulan Ting, who was released from prison on bail due to illness and is receiving treatment at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, has been unable to eat for the past two months due to intestinal obstruction, and his abdomen is swollen like a drum. His aged body is suffering greatly, and his condition has worsened. Mr. Wulan is staying in Room 18 of the hospital, under the exclusive care of nurse Zhang Jizhen. The hospital has repeatedly performed gastric lavage and administered plasma and saline solution over the past two days. When a reporter visited at 3:00 PM yesterday, the intravenous tube was still inserted in Mr. Wulan's mouth, and he was receiving the infusion. Mr. Wulan is unable to speak, has only a weak breath, his temperature fluctuates, and his pulse is also irregular. He has only drunk a small amount of Qiaozishui and chicken soup in the hospital for several days. The hospital firmly refuses family visits to avoid upsetting the patient. According to Dr. Chen Xixian of the hospital: Mr. Wulan is currently suffering from a gastrointestinal disorder or a malignant blood disease. Due to his old age and weakness, X-ray fluoroscopy cannot be used, making it difficult to determine the true nature of his condition. The plasma and saline solution being administered are emergency measures. When the reporter left the hospital, Dr. Chen added that Mr. Wulan's condition has reached a critical stage.</p>
<h3>Wu Suiren Tried Yesterday; Arrived in Court Ill and Expressed Deep Remorse</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wu Suiren, the former chief of the accounting section of the General Affairs Office of the Executive Yuan, abused his power to misappropriate 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for speculative profit. After the case was discovered, the District Prosecutor's Office detained Wu. After the prosecutor's investigation concluded, he was indicted on charges of directly or indirectly seeking profit from matters under his supervision or management, in accordance with Article 3, Section 6 of the Statute for the Punishment of Embezzlement. The case was initially tried at the District Court yesterday at 3:15 PM. After Judge Shao Renjie and the court clerk took their seats, the defendant Wu Suiren was brought in by bailiffs from the waiting room. Wu looked haggard and thin, wearing a gray Russian hat and a dark gray long cotton robe. His hands were trembling, indicating that he was indeed ill. Wu stated that he was 48 years old, from Anhui Province. He returned to Shanghai from Chongqing in May of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) and took the position of chief of the accounting section in August, responsible for staff salaries, remittances, and other matters. His official rank was originally recommended Grade 1, later changed to appointed. As for the huge sum of 2.7 billion yuan, it was a reimbursement from the Ministry of Finance for salaries paid in advance to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for September. It was remitted to the Central Bank in this city, and he alone collected it and transferred it to the account of the accounting section of the Executive Yuan at the Central Trust Bureau. When the funds arrived in Shanghai, he did not report it to his superiors and successively used 1.7 billion yuan, which was divided into batches and lent to two friends, Wu and Zhou, at interest rates ranging from 14% to 9%. After the incident, he returned all the principal and interest to the Executive Yuan and reported it orally and in writing to the Director and Secretary-General and admitted his guilt. He stated that the matter was purely a momentary mistake and asked the court for forgiveness, expressing deep remorse. Witness Wu Hongan testified that he had borrowed money from Wu Suiren, but only knew that the money belonged to Wu's friend and did not know it was public funds from the Executive Yuan. After the hearing concluded, the defendant's defense lawyer requested the court to grant bail, arguing that the defendant was suffering from illness due to malnutrition in prison. The court ordered that the case be rescheduled for further hearing, and that the defendant could receive medical treatment in prison. The request for bail was rejected, and Wu Suiren was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Entrusts This Column to Distribute Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Those who are extremely poor, unemployed, elderly, weak, or disabled are encouraged to apply promptly.</p>
<p>This column has recently been entrusted by the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA) to distribute several hundred sets of winter clothing. At this time of severe cold, there are many impoverished and distressed people. The number of hidden poor is countless. Compassion is innate in everyone. Therefore, the staff of this column believes that the distribution of winter clothing is urgent. We hope that readers will inform the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphaned children to apply promptly in accordance with the regulations to receive the clothing. The letter from the Shanghai Branch of the RRA and the distribution guidelines are recorded below:</p>
<p>"To the Editor: In order to widely distribute winter clothing, this branch previously sent a letter requesting your newspaper to assist in the distribution. We now understand that you have inquired about the distribution method and should follow the instructions. Therefore, we are enclosing a copy of the simplified rules for your reference. Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, January 17."</p>
<p>[Simplified Rules for Distributing Winter Clothing] (1) The winter clothing produced and distributed by this branch is limited to those who are extremely poor, unemployed, and in genuine need, with priority given to the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphaned children. (2) Needy students in schools will be distributed by the Student Relief Association. Homeless people on the streets will be taken in and distributed by the Winter Relief Association's shelters. Refugees in transit will be distributed directly by this branch. These are not included in the distribution by various delegated organizations. (3) When distributing winter clothing, delegated organizations should limit distribution to those residing in nearby areas and who have been verified to be in need. (4) When receiving winter clothing, recipients should present their citizen identification card, household registration certificate, or other proof of identification, and should provide a receipt. (5) After distributing winter clothing, delegated organizations should clearly state the recipient's circumstances of poverty and detailed address on the receipt. (6) The winter clothing produced and distributed by this branch this year is for use in this winter. Delegated organizations should make every effort to distribute them as early as possible so that they are timely and submit all receipts to this branch for record-keeping after distribution is complete. (7) The number of winter clothing produced and distributed by this branch is limited, so priority should be given to applications in the order they are received. If there are too many applications, the most urgent cases should be selected for distribution, or applications can be made to other delegated organizations. If the number of people is small, efforts should be made to borrow from other organizations.</p>
<h3>Thrift and Poverty Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain lady donated 120,000 yuan in legal tender (i.e., the anonymous donor in the donation report) to be used as relief funds for the Qíngxiá orphans, widows, and the poor. According to the lady, the funds were the proceeds from the Christmas celebrations of her and her sibling last year. Feeling compassion for the general orphans, widows, the elderly and weak, who are struggling in poverty, she decided to donate the money to charity. The lady's thrift and poverty relief are commendable. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society will respond and provide a lifeline for the poor!</p>

<h3>Strong Buyer Demand: Gold Prices Rise Again After Suppression</h3>
<p>Despite pressure from the Central Bank yesterday, the overwhelming demand from buyers caused gold prices to continue to rise. The market opened slightly higher at 3.73 million, but there was still resistance above 3.75 million. At 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 270 bars at a price of 3.75 million. Afterwards, new buyer demand was very strong, and the Central Bank temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Eventually, the price broke through the 3.8 million mark, reaching a high of 3.84 million. The Central Bank sold again at the high price, which caused a brief struggle and a drop back to 3.76 million. However, due to continued demand in the actual sales market, the price rebounded to 3.81 million at noon. In the afternoon, there was little change due to it being Saturday, and the quoted price remained around 3.82 million, an increase of 125,000 compared to the previous close. Silver dollars rose sharply by 10%. Due to the year-end season, actual sales were brisk, and the informal interest rate on silver tightened, ranging from 15% to 20%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were lackluster. The support from the gold market slightly boosted the value of U.S. dollars in the informal market, which initially traded around 6,400. Later, due to the increase in gold prices, it rose to 6,600 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, there was little change due to it being Saturday. The result was an increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars remained stagnant. The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars rose to 1,230 yuan and 1,250 yuan yesterday. The exchange rate for Indian rupees was 1,500 yuan to 1,520 yuan, and the exchange rate for British pounds was 19,700 yuan to 19,800 yuan. Only Hong Kong dollars saw some trading activity, while the others had quoted prices but no actual transactions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 11th installment of Chinese stocks was traded. The market was very volatile, initially low and then high. The swap premium was the same, initially falling to 22 yuan due to selling by Financial Helper and Xingye, with a daily interest rate of only 12%. Later, due to the appearance of large over-the-counter traders, the interest rate soared to as much as 28%. Delivery of Yung Shing Yarn increased considerably. Various small stocks all rose under the absorption of scattered speculative funds. The market opened low in the morning. During the session, both long and short positions swapped positions, and the long positions were more active. Stocks like 231, 224, 196, 16, 22, and 226 were all absorbed, and the swap premium decreased, rising to 767 yuan for delivery and 740 yuan for spot. Stock 14 was supplied when it went down, and stocks 97, 16, 152, 172, and 196 also sold Yung Shing Yarn, once falling back to the opening price. Stocks 198, 76, 145, 20, 186, and 78 all increased. As the gold market trended higher, the premium for over-the-counter trading increased, gradually rising to a high of 750 yuan for immediate delivery and 790 yuan for delivery. Stock 145, 129, and 30 sold spot Yung Shing Yarn, which slightly lowered the price. The market turned sideways near noon, and closed slightly higher. The arbitrage premium also gradually rose to a premium of 37 yuan for Yung Shing Yarn and 10 yuan for Sino-British. The demand for various small stocks was urgent, and they all ended at high prices. The result was a slight increase in Yung Shing Yarn, Mei Ya, and Hua Feng, and a slight decrease in Sino-British. Jingfu and Qin Xing rose by more than 50%, and Xin Guang rose by 8%, which was the most eye-catching. The cold stock Yung Gong rose by 50%. Other stocks saw both increases and decreases. Among the delivery stocks, Yung Shing Yarn, Mei Ya, Qin Xing, and Hua Feng rose slightly, Xin Guang rose by slightly less than 10%, and Sino-British rose by slightly less than 50%. In the over-the-counter market, except for Da Sheng, which continued to advance, the rest of the stocks saw both increases and decreases.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were traded for only one hour yesterday. After 11:00 AM, trading was suspended due to auditing. The stocks saw varying increases and decreases. The result was a slight increase or decrease in each stock compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>The bond market was even more stagnant yesterday, with very little trading. Unified Bond C opened at 2,000 yuan, with a high of 2,130 yuan and a low of 1,980 yuan. It ultimately fluctuated between 2,100 yuan and 2,150 yuan. The result was a slight decrease of 20 yuan for Type A and B bonds compared to the previous close, and an increase of 50 yuan for Type C bonds. Types D and E remained flat.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cloth, and Rayon Markets to Close Tomorrow; Reopen on the Sixth Day of the New Year</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the Lunar New Year closing of accounts, trading in the city's industries and commerce has gradually stagnated. Even when there is a market, there is very little activity. It is reported that starting next week, markets for commodities such as yarn, cloth, rayon, and cotton have all announced closures. The reopening of business for various industries will be delayed until the 27th of this month (the sixth day of the Lunar New Year) because the fifth day of the New Year falls on a Sunday.</p>
<h3>Meeting Year-End Cooking Oil Needs: China National Plant Oil Factory Distributes as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>In order to solve the year-end cooking oil needs of the city, Mayor Wu specially summoned Li Tingdong, manager of the state-owned China National Plant Oil Factory, and Zhang Decheng, the factory director, yesterday morning, instructing them to be responsible for the supply of cooking oil in the city during the year-end season. The factory has agreed to maintain the supply, but has requested two things: (1) a relaxation of the electricity supply in order to increase production, and (2) the provision of working capital. Mayor Wu has agreed to find a solution. According to Manager Li, there is no need to worry about a shortage of cooking oil in the city during the year-end season, and the factory will distribute as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Prices Soar: Increase by One-Third</h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, and the new Lunar New Year's Day is imminent, cigarette sales have skyrocketed. Due to strong demand from vendors in various regions and absorption by local small-scale hoarders, prices have soared by one-third since yesterday morning, a rare phenomenon in history. The highest price was for Great Britain cigarettes, with the wholesale price once reaching 2.2 million. British American Tobacco cigarettes also saw a significant increase in price. Retail shops and stalls have all changed their labels and revised their prices. For example, a pack of 20 white-tin cigarettes, which originally sold for 2,500 yuan, was selling for 3,500 yuan a pack yesterday afternoon. A pack of 10 Old Knife cigarettes, which originally sold for 300 to 350 yuan, was selling for 400 to 450 yuan. Top-of-the-line cigarettes were even more popular. This is all due to the fact that the Lunar New Year is approaching, businesses are preparing for holidays, and retailers are taking the opportunity to raise prices in order to profit. According to industry insiders, this phenomenon is due to the squeezed production of cigarette factories. This situation will reverse after the first five days of the new year.</p>
<h3>Banks' Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts May Not Withdraw Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>The reporter recently learned from the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank that, in order to strengthen the management of foreign exchange, the department recently notified all designated foreign exchange banks that foreign currency may not be withdrawn from foreign currency deposit accounts, nor may they be transferred between accounts. Furthermore, the circumstances of withdrawals from foreign currency accounts must be reported to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department at any time.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Association Establishes Subcommittees; Central Bank Explains Settlement Procedures</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Import and Export Association held a board meeting yesterday afternoon, passing resolutions to establish four committees: a Mediation Committee, an International Trade Committee, a Industry Regulation Research Committee, and a Tax Research Committee, and deciding on the following: (1) The members of each committee will be nominated by the board of directors of the association from among the member representatives, and will be appointed upon deliberation. (2) The board of directors may appoint members or non-members, experts, or experienced persons as committee members or guiding advisors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Central Bank Foreign Exchange Examination Department responded to the Import and Export Association's inquiry on the issues of settlement and letters of credit, stating: "Upon investigation, if an importer is unable to ship goods due to strikes, suspension of shipping, or other difficulties, and applies to this department through a designated bank to extend the letter of credit for the purchase of goods, this department will take into account the actual circumstances and grant as much leeway as possible, in line with the purpose of developing international trade and supporting legitimate business. However, the extension of the letter of credit and the issuance of the import permit are two separate matters. It cannot be said that the letter of credit can be extended simply because a permit has been obtained. Furthermore, the established practice for issuing letters of credit cannot be changed and has been in place for a long time, and there appears to be no need to change it at present. As for settlement procedures, the procedures stipulated in the circular from the association can be followed."</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Market Stalls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, was also the 27th day of the old lunar month, and the woolen fabric market was mostly stalled. Except for retail stores, there were almost no wholesale transactions. Both buyers and sellers were busy settling accounts, preparing to get through the year-end and welcome the New Year, and then resume business after the reopening. Opinions on the future market vary. According to industry insiders, if the exchange rate does not change and the gold price remains stable, there should be no significant increases or decreases in woolen fabric prices.</p>
<h3>Banks' Cash Position Loosens; Year-End Can Be Passed Stably</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to financial sources: the Lunar New Year is fast approaching. The cash position management of various banks and money houses has generally come to an end. In order to solidify their own strength, all banks and money houses are actively recovering loans that have been issued in order to prepare for lending plans after the Lunar New Year reopening. For this reason, the cash position within the financial industry has been quite loose recently. According to the results of the check clearing house yesterday, the four major banks and two bureaus cleared more than 10 billion yuan for various banks and money houses. Therefore, judging from recent trends, the financial industry is expected to pass the year-end stably. However, most general businesses, except those that have obtained production loans from the authorities in advance, feel that their cash position is tight, which is due to the banks and money houses recovering old debts. The cash position is expected to loosen after the reopening.</p>
<h3>Export Value of Silk, Tea, Tung Oil, Bristles, and Wool Was Only Over One Hundred Billion in the First Eleven Months of Last Year</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, in the first eleven months of last year, the main raw materials exported from our country were: 271,988 kilograms of tung oil, 52,629 kilograms of tea, 602,193 kilograms of raw silk, 4,184,305 kilograms of pig bristles, and 444,132 kilograms of wool, with a total value of 139,775,054,000 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Trade Deficit</h3>
<p>[Report from our Fuzhou correspondent on the 18th] Fuzhou's total import value last year was 45.3 billion, and the total export value was 32.1 billion. Special products accounted for 28 billion of the export value. The trade deficit reached a huge 13.1 billion.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Sales Improve; Grain Transactions Scarce</h3>
<p>4,890 shi of rice arrived from both the North and the South. As the end of the year approaches, both large households and small families need to prepare grain for the New Year, so sales have improved. Shops are actively stocking up, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply. Northern and Southern Japonica rice prices continue to rise by 2,000 yuan. White Yuan rice prices are stable, while Yin Yuan rice prices fluctuate, with an increase of 1,000 yuan. Indica rice is still traded little. Grain transactions are scarce. There are not many sellers of raw oil, and stock is also not selling well. Refined oil remains unchanged, but sesame oil is gradually declining, continuing to fall by 4,000 yuan. Soybean cake prices continue to rise by 100-200 yuan due to activity by visiting vendors. Wheat bran is stable, and flour remains lackluster, remaining fair. Red bean prices are brisk, rising sharply by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Tea beans are stable, raw peanuts are strong, and peanuts are tight. Other grains have not yet opened for trading. The market officially closes today and will be closed from tomorrow until the 27th of January, Monday, when trading will resume as usual.</p>
<h3>If a Cotton Mill's Cotton Inventory Is Less Than Two Months, An Emergency Application Can Be Made, But The Application Quantity Cannot Exceed Three Months</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Transportation and Control Board held its second meeting at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Committee members present included Chairman Li Gan, Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, Wang Qiyu, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, Zhang Silu, and Liu Wenteng, director of the Textile Control Board's Business Department. Chairman Li Gan presided over the meeting, which adjourned at 6:30 PM. There were three important motions: (1) to approve the draft organizational charter of the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee; (2) to discuss the cotton inventory statistics reported by the various cotton mills. However, the figures reported by various parties were quite inconsistent. Although they were cross-referenced for a long time, the task was not completed, so the entire allocation plan was not discussed; (3) If a factory's cotton inventory is less than two months, it can apply to purchase foreign cotton in advance. However, the application quantity cannot exceed three months. The Cotton Industry Association of the Sixth District is requested to notify its members to investigate. Those with less than two months of cotton inventory can make an emergency application. The Allocation Committee will discuss and approve the matter at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Sales Are Quite Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the yarn market. Visiting vendors took advantage of the cheap prices to buy, creating a buying frenzy. As a result, 20-count yarn continued to rise by 20,000 to 80,000, with the heaviest weight goods seeing the largest increase due to activity by vendors from South China. Ordinary light-weight 20-count yarn also rose by 20,000-30,000. Visiting vendors from inland areas have absorbed a significant amount. Fine yarn and double-ply yarn have not seen much fluctuation. People's minds are stable. It is reported that the cash positions of various yarn companies have been arranged, and they will pass the year-end stably.</p>
<h3>Sugar Import and Export Continuous</h3>
<p>Foreign Sugar Also Arrives, 50,000 Bags</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Sugar imports continue unabated. In addition to shipments from Guangdong and Taiwan, foreign sugar has now arrived. The "Dureen" (transliteration) vessel, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai from Vancouver, carrying a large quantity of timber and 51,980 bags of foreign sugar. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening and is currently docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading. Furthermore, a considerable amount of sugar has recently been shipped to Tianjin. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haihan" vessel sailed north yesterday afternoon, carrying an estimated 3,200 bags of sugar, over 160 boxes of tea, more than 590 pieces of piece goods, and over 180 pieces of cotton yarn to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Export Tax Levied on Indian Tea</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Authorities announced last night that an export tax of two annas per pound (one anna equals one-sixteenth of a rupee) would be levied on tea, effective immediately.</p>
<h3>Price of Japanese Silk Cocoons Still Uncertain; Tax on Shipments to China Awaits Confirmation</h3>
<p>According to a representative of the China Sericulture Corporation, the company received an order from the Executive Yuan sometime last week regarding the shipment of Japanese silk cocoons to China. Allied forces could ship one million pounds of Japanese silk cocoons to China at a price of US$2.75 per pound. The company immediately calculated the cost of reeling based on a conversion rate of 400 catties, plus various expenses, estimating the cost of producing one pound of raw silk at over US$8. However, given that the highest price for Chinese silk in the current US market is only US$7 per pound, the company immediately countered with a price of US$2.50 per pound. A response has not yet been received, and it is difficult to predict whether Allied Headquarters will agree. Rumors of the imminent arrival of Japanese silk cocoons in China remain to be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Hit New High; Many Daily Necessities Are Rising</h3>
<p>In recent days, various industries have been frequently closing down in anticipation of the upcoming New Year's Eve. The soap and daily necessities trade has been the most bustling. Yesterday morning, "Guben" brand soap once rose to 120,000 yuan per case, with retail prices reaching 2,000 yuan per bar. Other brands have also risen in price due to eager buying. Prices eased slightly in the afternoon, with prices quoted this morning at 100,500 yuan, and scissors at 100,200 yuan. Soap factories are reluctant to release actual goods due to excessive losses. New factory stocks will not be available for another week or two. Some soap factories have already closed for the New Year holiday, while others are working day and night to meet market demand and recoup raw material costs. Other daily necessities, such as cigarettes and matches, are also experiencing significant price increases. Businesses specializing in Southern goods are thriving, and fabric stores will be closing for the holiday within a day or two. Department stores and food businesses are gearing up for the three days before the end of the year, traditionally their busiest period. Some fashion companies, however, are experiencing a slowdown and are making every effort to attract customers. Jewelry stores are crowded with customers and struggling to keep up with demand. Some jewelry stores are staying open at night to satisfy the public's gold-buying frenzy.</p>
<p>Further reports indicate that soap prices are rising in a straight line. According to industry insiders, the main raw materials for soap, such as caustic soda and soda ash, are in short supply in the city, and foreign imports are delayed due to the need for permits. While Imperial Chemical Industries has recently shipped over a thousand barrels to Shanghai, import permits have been slow to arrive, preventing the goods from being released to the market. Two months ago, caustic soda was still priced at 600,000 yuan per barrel, but it has now skyrocketed to 3,000,000 yuan. Domestic production of tallow is insufficient, and before the war, China relied on Australia for supplies, but no shipments are currently arriving. As a result, the price of tallow per dan (approximately 50 kilograms) has risen from 100,000 yuan two months ago to the current price of 200,000 yuan. The situation with coconut oil is relatively good. However, soap prices were unusually low one or two months ago. Manufacturers produced soap from high-priced raw materials and sold it at low prices, incurring significant losses, which led to a general reduction in production. Although market prices are now rising steadily, raw material costs are increasing even faster, so production is still not profitable. Furthermore, factory stock prices are only about 80% of the market price. It is reported that there are currently over 40 soap manufacturers in Shanghai, with varying business scopes. Some manufacturers have already closed down due to losses, and most of those remaining have reduced their operations. The average operating rate of manufacturers is only about 50%. If all factories were operating at full capacity, their output would be sufficient to meet market demand. It is rumored that the industry is considering new factory stocks, which should become clear in a week or two.</p>
<h3>Central Government Fully Supports the Future Production and Sales of Fujian Tea</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou] Fujian tea has always sold well in domestic and foreign markets and occupies an extremely important position in international trade. Recently, due to the impact of foreign exchange and transportation, sales have stagnated, and Fujian tea merchants suffered significant losses last year. At the same time, the government and the Chenmin Bank failed to provide tea loans in a timely manner, and tea farmers, lacking funds, sharply reduced production, and the quality deteriorated. The tea industry, which had always been an important specialty product of Fujian Province, has steadily declined. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs is preparing a tea industry revival plan for the 36th year of the Republic (1947) and is greatly concerned about the production, sales, manufacturing methods, and organization of tea cooperatives in Fujian. It will provide financial and technical assistance to the development of Fujian tea to promote export trade.</p>
<h3>Small Statistics on Production Loans</h3>
<p>Over 40 Billion Already Approved; Approximately 200 Factories</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is reported that since the Provisional Review Committee for Production Business Loans of the Joint Treasury of Four Banks began its work, it has approved a total loan amount of over 43 billion yuan, benefiting approximately 200 factories.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Supply Still Not Normal</h3>
<p>The supply of gasoline in Shanghai has not improved as the import procedures for the tankers of the three major gasoline companies have not yet been completed, and the Jianghai Customs has prohibited their import, causing a gasoline panic. As of yesterday, the situation had not yet improved. Some gas stations in the central district experienced queues, and the amount of gasoline per vehicle was temporarily limited to three gallons, priced at 5,900 yuan. According to sources at Asiatic Petroleum Company, import procedures should be completed within days, so this situation should be resolved soon. As for rumors of an imminent increase in gasoline prices, the company has denied them.</p>
<h3>Central Bank to Organize a Silk Weaving Industry Export Committee</h3>
<p>In order to rescue the silk weaving and satin factories from their economic crisis, the Central Bank plans to organize a special silk weaving industry export committee, which will be formally established after the Lunar New Year. At the same time, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association has established a silk joint venture company to cooperate with the above policies. The special committee will purchase dried cocoons and hand them over to the joint venture company to weave silk, which will then be returned to the special committee for unified export. The special committee will provide direct loans to silk factories to facilitate the turnover of funds.</p>
<h3>Production of Flour Mills in Shanghai Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>In recent months, only five major flour mills in Shanghai, including Fuxin, Zaofeng, Huafeng, Weixin, and Futong, have been operating normally. The remaining smaller mills are temporarily closed. It was learned yesterday that the total flour production in Shanghai was 1,213,640 bags in October last year, which decreased to 494,310 bags in November, and further decreased to 214,497 bags in December (last month), only one-sixth of the October production. The main reasons for the decrease in production are as follows: (1) insufficient supply of wheat raw materials, foreign wheat has not yet arrived, and the cost of domestic wheat is high, which prevents increased production; (2) prices were not adjusted in the past two months, making it difficult for manufacturers to profit, thus reducing production; (3) production is affected by electricity restrictions. Due to the above reasons, production has decreased every month. However, the negotiated price of flour has recently increased from 20,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan, and all mills are preparing to increase production. It is expected that production will increase after the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Deteriorating</h3>
<p>Recently, the tea market has become increasingly quiet as the end of the year approaches and some export companies are still rushing to ship "Chou Zhen Zhen Mei" and other green teas to French Africa. Inquiries have plummeted, transactions have been declining, and the trend is particularly bleak. According to industry insiders, the French company Shui Xing Foreign Firm is still actively negotiating overseas for bulk Chinese tea. If these negotiations proceed smoothly, there may be considerable exports after the Lunar New Year. As for various types of tea for domestic sales, the trend remains very sluggish.</p>
<h3>US Automobile Industry Hopes to Abolish Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] The US automobile industry hopes that export restrictions, even if they cannot be completely abolished, should be eased. An industry spokesman pointed out that, in order to compete in the markets outside customs barriers, British truck and freight car manufacturers are exporting half of their passenger car production and one-third of their commercial vehicle production. It is also believed that French manufacturers are exporting 70% of their truck production. The export figures for the British automobile industry in 1946 were quite favorable, with 135,000 passenger cars, 190,000 freight cars, and a number of other commercial vehicles being sold in overseas markets. However, due to government controls, manufacturers are unable to export their trucks and freight cars in proportion to their production. These controls limit passenger car exports to 6.3% and truck exports to 20.4% of annual production. The highest number of vehicles manufactured in the US and shipped overseas was 451,095 passenger cars and 82,667 freight cars.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Announces Last Year's Remittances from Overseas Chinese: Amounts Decreasing Daily; Reason Lies in the Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Overseas Remittances Group of the International Department of the Bank of China completed the compilation of remittance figures from January to December of last year and listed them as follows: Month Amount (National Currency Yuan)</p>
<p>January 87,273,298</p>
<p>February 42,611,217</p>
<p>March 4,748,490,000</p>
<p>April 8,619,609,930</p>
<p>May 6,722,763,456</p>
<p>June 5,790,334,839</p>
<p>July 4,061,720,261</p>
<p>August 8,300,615</p>
<p>September 7,291,107,234</p>
<p>October 7,222,501,242</p>
<p>November 4,703,110,015</p>
<p>December 3,678,442</p>
<p>The figures for January and February are small because the official foreign exchange rate was not yet fixed and was still calculated at the previous rate of 20 yuan. If the full amount of subsidies is included, the original figures should be increased by a factor of 24. Starting in March, after the new exchange rate of 2020 was announced, remittances increased sharply, reaching their peak in April. After April, they gradually decreased. In August, when the exchange rate was changed to 3350, the figures increased slightly again. After August, the exchange rate did not change, but the black market for US dollars became increasingly active, so remittance figures decreased every month, falling to just over 3.6 billion yuan in December. In US dollar terms, the difference between December and April exceeded threefold. According to a person in charge of the Bank of China's International Department, this shocking difference is due to the evasion of remittances. According to past remittance figures, the monthly figures should not have significant differences, and the December figures are usually larger than the previous months. The fact that the December figures are the smallest and differ greatly from the previous months is noteworthy. The Bank of China has reviewed its own operations and found that its remittance processing speed is no less than that of foreign banks, so the reason for evading remittances is the large difference between the official and black market prices of US dollars. Remittances from overseas Chinese are mostly concentrated in Hong Kong. For example, the Bank of China's Rangoon branch was originally established to handle remittances, but in recent months, business has been slow, making it virtually useless. Currently, we have sent a senior official to Hong Kong to conduct a thorough investigation, and the results of the investigation will soon be clear.</p>
<h3>Provincial Banks in Shanghai to Establish a United Remittance Center</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate inter-provincial remittances to major ports across the country, provincial banks nationwide, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's instructions, will establish United Remittance Centers for National Provincial Banks in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. The United Remittance Center in Shanghai is being planned by the Standing Committee of the Provincial Banks in Shanghai. A symposium was held at the United Association of National Provincial Banks on Chengdu Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than a dozen people in charge of the Shanghai branches of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, the Hunan Provincial Bank, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank attended. The meeting elected representatives from the Guangdong, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Farmers Banks to study and formulate the United Remittance Center's remittance methods and elected the Guangdong Provincial Bank as the convener.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The issue of tuition fees for the next semester at private schools in Guangzhou is becoming increasingly serious.

Both parties have requested the Department of Education to increase or decrease the fees. Students have been taking collective action, stating that if negotiations fail, they will take concrete and effective countermeasures, believing that charging exorbitant tuition fees is equivalent to barring them from school. It is reported that some students have been forced to withdraw from school as a result.</p>

<p>Since its restoration, Zhengzhong Book Company's business has been expanding daily. Recently, in order to offer preferential treatment to authors, for both first and reprint editions, royalties are calculated based on the number of copies printed, regardless of actual sales, and paid in full after publication. Payments are made in three installments each year, at the end of April, August, and December.

<h3>Upset in Basketball League: Hualian Loses to Chunmao Team by One Point: 38 to 39</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In the second Basketball League, an upset occurred last night in Group A1. The defending champion Hualian team had an unfavorable start, losing its first battle by a single point to the Chunmao team, a reincarnation of Huanan, with a score of 38 to 39. In the first half, Hualian led by two points with a score of 14 to 12. In Group A2, Huayang defeated Peier by a single point, 28 to 27. The Qinglian team defeated Qianghua in the women's group, 32 to 22. The battle report is divided as follows.</p>
<p>Women's Group Takes the Stage</p>
<p>In the first match, the Qianghua women's team faced the Qinglian team. Sun Fengzhu of Qinglian participated despite an injury, reducing her power. Qianghua put on a spirited performance. In the first quarter, Qinglian led by only one point, 5 to 4. In the second quarter, Cao Manli of Qianghua scored repeatedly, creating a tie at 10. Later, Sun Fengzhu and Liu Huishan of Qinglian each scored, and Qinglian led by 16 to 10 at halftime. After the break, Qinglian was exceptionally rampant. Little sister Xu Peizhen and Sun Fengzhu played skillfully. Qianghua eventually fell behind due to experience, and trailed 17 to 26 in the third quarter. In the final quarter, both sides were exhausted and scored little. As a result, Qinglian won with a score of 32 to 22, achieving a successful start.</p>
<p>The Fatty Wins</p>
<p>In the second act, Huayang of Group A fought Peier. One side was young and energetic, full of vigor, while the other side was large-bellied, like Mount Tai. The battle was very exciting. The fat gentlemen scored mostly with long-range shots into the empty basket. Three minutes after the whistle, neither side had scored. Sun Mingxin and Dong Zhongyi of Huayang scored from the midline, taking a 4 to 0 lead. Shen Beizhang of Peier scored with a shot and a free throw, and Hu Huizhao quickly broke through to score. Hu Huikai rose to chase, but Dong Zhongyi of Huayang made a wonderful empty-basket shot. At the end of the first half, Peier trailed by one and a half points, 15 to 18. After the break, Dong Zhongyi of Huayang scored two goals first. Shen Beizhang of Peier recovered four points, and the two sides fought fiercely for a long time, with Huayang leading by only one point, 24 to 25. When the Hu Huizhao and Hu Huikai brothers were successively fouled out of the game, their momentum was suddenly diminished. In the last four minutes, they trailed 28 to 24. Huayang, thinking there was not much time left, passed the ball around. When time ran out, the fat team overwhelmed Peier with a score of 28 to 27, by one point.</p>
<p>The Final Battle</p>
<p>In the final battle, Hualian fought Chunmao. The former was the champion of the previous season, while the latter was the entire team of Huanan, so the battle was quite exciting. Tang Baokun received the ball from the midline and sent it forward, and Ren Xiangcheng flew to support him. Then, Baokun scored with a long-range shot, giving Hualian a 4-0 lead. Chunmao hurriedly called a timeout to discuss a counterattack. Li Xianzheng made the first contribution, Huang Tianlie made two free throws, and Liu Shanfu scored with a long-range shot. After eight minutes, Chunmao took the lead with 8 to 5. Hualian was anxious, and Bao Songyuan and Chen Xuechong launched an attack, connecting consecutively. Chunmao called three timeouts, and at the end of the first half, they trailed Hualian by one goal, 12 to 14.</p>
<p>Hualian Suffers a Defeat</p>
<p>Switching sides and fighting again, Chunmao's offensive suddenly tightened. Li Xianzheng scored with a push and a free throw, and A Biao then scored. Although Bao Songyuan of Hualian recovered a point, Liu Shanfu scored two throws and one free throw, and Chunmao took the lead again with 22 to 16. Xiao Zhang of Hualian was absent-minded and missed both free throws. By the last four minutes, Hualian trailed 27 to 32. Hualian calmly responded, Xiao Zhang made a free throw and then scored with a long-range shot, and Ren Xiangcheng scored another point on a free throw, trailing by only one goal, 31 to 33. Bao Songyuan made one of two free throws, still trailing by one point. The situation was extremely tense. Li Zhen frowned tightly outside the field, unable to find a solution. Bao Songyuan pushed in again, and Zhang Liangxiong scored with a long-range shot. Hualian fought hard and took the lead again, but He Hanfu of Chunmao scored three consecutive points, settling the matter. Zhang Liangxiong scored with a long-range shot, but it was too late to save the situation. Chunmao defeated Hualian by one point, 39 to 38.</p>

<h3>Sugar and Insecticides: The Highest Production Record in Taichung</h3>
<p>— Yang Yu, Our Correspondent in Taiwan</p>
<p>Air Mail on the 4th</p>
<p>A history of the sugar industry is enough to write about the vicissitudes of Taiwan. As the largest enterprise in Taiwan and even the Far East, it has been around for more than 300 years. From the Dutch occupation of Taiwan, through the rule of Zheng Chenggong and the Qing Dynasty, to the exploitation by the Japanese and the recovery of today, it has always kept the island with it, occupying a very important position in the economy of the Far East.</p>
<p>Under the colonial management of the Japanese, the sugar industry in Taiwan was regarded as a very important link and source of profit. They spared no effort to improve the sugar industry according to the suggestions of Dr. Nitobe, who was sent to various countries around the world to investigate the sugar industry. Many old-fashioned sugar mills and factories were sacrificed in this torrent, and were replaced by nine large-scale sugar monopoly companies established by the Japanese in Taiwan. They used new machinery to create the highest production record in the sugar industry in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Sugar Industry in Crisis, Full of Hardships</p>
<p>After an unprecedented war, Taiwan's sugar industry also took a sharp turn. After the restoration, the sugar company jointly operated by the Resources Committee and the Chief Executive's Office received many war-torn factories from the Japanese. To date, there are 37, some of which have been repaired and put into operation, while others have been too damaged and need to be reorganized for a period of time before they can be put into operation. Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, recently came to Taiwan and gave a speech in the Senate, saying that the sugar production in the 36th year could be increased to 100,000 tons, and the output would be gradually increased to 1 million tons in three years. For the factory itself, it seems not impossible to achieve this goal, but looking at the land, there are many hardships in front of us.</p>
<p>During the Japanese rule, everything was for the benefit of their own country. By unscrupulous means, the sugar industry in Taiwan was like their source of life, and they did not let go of it at all. They forced farmers to grow sugarcane and controlled the price of rice, making it the same as the price of sugarcane. To put it nicely, on the one hand, they encouraged sugarcane planting, and on the other hand, they guaranteed prices. At the same time, they also used cheap rations of food and fertilizer as bait. Under this two-pronged policy, considerable results were naturally achieved, but now the farmers have to make such a calculation: the Japanese conscripted the manpower and food here during the war, and in order to have enough to eat, they had to plant more rice. Moreover, sugarcane can only be harvested once every 18 months, while rice can be harvested twice or even three times a year, and some beans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains can be planted in spare time. The landlords also think this way. Now the government seems to have a way to draw water from the bottom of the pot. Fertilizer, the main food of Taiwan's land, cannot be solved quickly. Although the sugar industry has received 50,000 tons of fertilizer from the 200,000 tons of fertilizer shipped from the Relief Administration, the quality is different, the quantity is not enough, and the distribution is very difficult.</p>
<p>Although agricultural loans are being organized, six installments are paid each year, but it was not until the fourth installment that the first installment could be paid with difficulty. The money for the Taiwan Sugar Company is taken from the Bank of Taiwan, but the budget of 600 million Taiwan dollars exceeds the amount issued by Taiwan, which is also a problem in terms of funding.</p>
<p>The conscription of food is also a major threat to sugarcane farmers, who have to buy rice at a high price to complete the payment. No wonder these hardships force them to complain every day.</p>
<p>Daily Output of More Than 2,000 Dan</p>
<p>The Taichung Sugar Factory is a soil factory belonging to the first branch of the Tainan Huwei Taiwan Sugar Company. Its predecessor was the "Imperial Sugar Manufacturing Co., Ltd.". This word has been eroded on the towering chimney and is almost impossible to distinguish. During the war, three bombs were dropped here, but fortunately, they did not hit the key points. Therefore, after officially taking over on May 1 this year, the liquor and sugar factory was quickly repaired. As for the sugar manufacturing factory, because it is still far from the start-up period in February next year, it is now cleaning the sugar residue that has condensed in the pipes of the machine. Hundreds of pipes have to be dismantled and inspected one by one, which is quite troublesome. Zhao Zhenyao, the director of the factory, told reporters that there are more than 450 employees, most of whom are now in the factory. Once the sugarcane harvest starts, the highest sugar-making efficiency can be exerted immediately. However, the biggest reason is that farmers are unwilling to grow sugarcane and there is a lack of fertilizer. Taking the output from the 34th to 35th years of the Republic of China as an example, the area of the farmland of the Zhong Sugar Factory was only more than 13,700 mu (originally, the farmland and sugarcane crops were everywhere, and the raw material area had a total area of nearly 450,000 mu, but the end of the war also brought misfortune here). The sugar production was about 60,000 catties per Jia. Although there are now about 30,000 mu of land, the sugarcane is pitifully thin. In previous years, sugar could be produced for four months, but now I am afraid that it will not be produced for even a month. As for whether the output can reach the previous output of more than 13,700 mu, it is still a question!</p>
<p>The equipment of the factory is quite complete, and the mechanical crushing capacity of sugarcane is 1,500 tons per day, and more than 2,000 dan of sugar can be produced every day. In this way, the government seems to have to quickly come up with a countermeasure to make the sugarcane in the fields live up to these high mechanical capabilities.</p>
<p>Complicated Procedures for Three Kinds of Sugar</p>
<p>Although it has not yet started, the reporter was still led to tour the factory under repair and they told me the step-by-step sugar-making procedures. After the sugarcane is harvested, it can be transported directly from the farm to the factory by the factory's train, weighed, and then unloaded by the unloader to the sugarcane conveyor. There are two sets of rolling knives on the top of the conveyor, which can cut the sugarcane, and then crush it and input it into the converging press. After being pressed by four sets of presses, the obtained sugarcane dregs are sent to the boiler room for fuel, and a part of it can be pressed to make pulp. Now, most of the ceilings in Taiwanese homes are sugarcane boards made of this pulp. The obtained sugarcane juice is pumped into a heated device to increase the temperature to 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit, and then put into a sulfurous acid action tank and simultaneously infused with 12 degrees BX (Brix concentration) lime water and 7-8% sulfur dioxide to remove impurities and colored substances from the sugarcane juice. Then, it is sent to a heater and heated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit, and then the impurities are precipitated and separated in the sedimentation tank. This has to go through two precipitations and screenings, and then the filter mud is pressed by a filter press. The obtained filter cake contains a lot of calcium, phosphorus and organic matter, which can be transported to the farm for fertilizer. The obtained clarified juice of 15 degrees BX is pumped into an evaporator with four-fold effectiveness to obtain a raw sugar syrup of 50 degrees BX, and then bleached again with sulfur dioxide in the sugar syrup sulfurous acidifier, and then input into a vacuum pot to concentrate the crystal product to obtain a sugar paste of 94 degrees BX. After being placed in a crystallization aid to fully crystallize, it is stirred through a sugar paste mixer, and then separated from the sugar by a divider, and the sugar made at this time is called No. 1 sugar. After being dried and packaged into finished products, the sugar will have a sugar content of about 8 degrees BX, and then vacuumed and concentrated to 94 degrees BX, and then crystallized by a divider to obtain No. 2 sugar and No. 2 sugar. After being concentrated, the crystallization of 96 degrees BX will be obtained to form No. 3 sugar, and the remaining No. 3 sugar can be used to manufacture alcohol and yeast.</p>
<p>People who eat sugar are happy for a moment, but who knows that its production has so many cumbersome procedures?</p>
<p>"Died" a New Insecticide</p>
<p>"Died" insecticide is extracted from Derris Beuth, a specialty of Taiwan. Its natural distribution is in Annam, Siam, Malaysia, etc. In the past, there was a saying in Malaysia: "No Tuba, no vegetables." (Tuba means Derris) It can be seen that the insecticide effect of Derris has long been discovered. The Taichung Sugar Factory used to use it to kill sugarcane pests and once owned 408 Jia of Derris farms. Now it is manufacturing a solution called "Died", a common insecticide. The most important ingredient in "Died" is rotenone, which is extremely toxic. A solution of one million times can kill a carp that is more than three feet long.</p>
<p>Derris essence can be extracted from Derris, which is even more terrible in toxicity. It was also made here and sold to the United States.</p>
<p>This Derris plant is planted on the farm of the Taichung Sugar Factory. An average of 2,000 catties can be harvested from one Jia (15 mu), but it can only be harvested once every three years to use it to contain sufficient rotenone. Therefore, the labor cost is quite expensive. People also plant it privately, and the Taichung Sugar Factory also collects it from them every year at a price of 15 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>The factory that manufactures "Died" has the following mechanical equipment: five cutting machines, one air heating device, one hot air dryer, four pulverizers, two screening machines, a mixer stand, and a steam can. The manufacturing process is very simple. I only spent half an hour there and saw its finished product. The Tao can make more than 500 catties every day.</p>
<p>Mixing Derris powder with soapy water can make the medicinal properties more durable. The Tainan Prefecture Farmers' Association has tested it and achieved satisfactory results. Some people took this medicine to Shanghai for testing and also proved that its insecticidal power exceeds DDT. This authentic and excellent domestic insecticide is very worth introducing and recommending to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>The Current State of Education in Hebei</h3>
<p>— Yang Bingshen, Our Newspaper Reporter</p>
<p>Baoding, January 2nd Dispatch</p>
<p>This reporter recently visited He Yixin, the director of the Education Department of Hebei Province, to inquire about the general situation of education in Hebei Province. Director He kindly provided a detailed account, covering the entire spectrum of education in Hebei. After careful recording by this reporter, it is presented to our readers.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the education in this province can be divided into four stages: First, the year following the outbreak of the war was a period of destruction, during which the original educational undertakings in this province were devastated by the Japanese invaders. Second, from September of the 27th year [1938] when the provincial government returned to Hebei, to January of the 29th year [1940], various aspects of education were able to be developed and promoted within the province, which can be called a period of progress. Third, from February of the 29th year [1940] onwards, the Provincial Department of Education resided in the province of Lin and focused more on relief efforts, which can be called a period of relief. Fourth, from the 32nd year [1943] onwards until the enemy's surrender, the emphasis was on preparing for repatriation, which can be called a period of preparation for repatriation.</p>
<p>Progress Route</p>
<p>Before Japan surrendered, its defeat was certain. The repatriation work of education in this province had already begun. In the 32nd year [1943], a registration of educational repatriation talent was conducted. Within one year after repatriation, the total number of schools received and restored was six higher education institutions (universities and colleges), forty-four public and private senior and junior high schools, thirty-three provincial and county normal schools and short-term normal schools, fourteen provincial elementary schools and kindergartens, twenty-nine provincial and county public education centers, and four mobile teaching groups. The number of schools is vastly different from before the war. School facilities and student coursework are also far inferior to pre-war levels, because most counties in this province were occupied by the Communist Party, the flames of war have not ceased, railways were destroyed, and transportation was blocked, making it particularly difficult to promote education. However, this province is still striving to overcome all difficulties. The main tasks are: (1) Strengthening guidance work in schools. All schools uniformly implement a tutor system, focusing on students' life training and spiritual training, guiding students' thinking, correcting extremist ideas, and implementing military training. All kinds of guidance regulations newly promulgated by the central government after the war are printed and distributed to schools for compliance. The Education Department also sends inspectors to supervise and improve at any time and place. (2) Revising the curriculum and implementing screening. During the eight years of Hebei's occupation, the curriculum of each school was not in accordance with the central government's regulations, and the content of textbooks even more violated the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. After receiving each school, Hebei urged each school to intensify remedial education in the Three Principles of the People. All students in school or graduates participate in the screening. (3) Providing relief to poor young people in various schools. Most of the students in each school whose families were in communist areas have lost their relief. The provincial government immediately sought to allocate food, distributing 50 jin of miscellaneous grains per person per month. This year, the central government was requested to allocate funds to relieve 750 students. Three summer camps were held during the summer vacation, training up to 3,000 students. (4) Promoting national education. Wherever the government's power reaches the counties, actively prepare to establish national schools. According to recent statistics, there are already 348 central national schools and 2,318 national schools. In addition, the qualifications of civic education teachers and counselors in secondary schools are reviewed, and various sectors of society are mobilized to run people's schools and other urgent educational tasks.</p>
<p>Future Policy</p>
<p>In the future, the primary educational policy of Hebei Province is to cooperate with the needs of the Party, government, and military departments, and continue to complete the repatriation work. However, at present, because the provincial government's power has not been smoothly developed, the plan is to gradually develop education in all counties of the province as the security circle expands, thoroughly eradicate all reactionary forces and obstacles in the educational advancement, and fully promote education under the national unified education system. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the knowledge level of the people. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Hebei Province were ravaged by Japanese invaders and communist troops, and their knowledge was poor and their lives were degraded, which is the greatest crisis for the nation. Therefore, at present, special emphasis is placed on the development of national education and livelihood education, with the aim of improving the people's knowledge level and living standards, so that we can talk about rural autonomy and rural construction. In addition, in line with the national construction plan, we will train various talents. Our leader, in his book "China's Destiny," formulated a ten-year construction plan for our country after the war, which requires more than 2.46 million technical talents of various types. This province should cooperate with this point to train various required talents and complete the great construction goals of our country. Also, we people of Hebei must carry forward the spirit of Hebei. The people of Yan and Zhao are mostly generous and tragic, with special spirits such as being brave and simple, emphasizing promises, and distinguishing between right and wrong. Lin Xiangru, Yang Jiaoshan, Sun Chengzong, and Yan Xizhai in history are all predecessors of Hebei and can be our representatives.</p>
<p>However, after Hebei was occupied, the people universally felt the enslavement and degradation education of the enemy and traitors. National justice and the spirit of Yan and Zhao have gradually declined. Now we must use the power of education to develop them, striving for every school to become a national fortress, every teacher to become a national mentor, every student to become a national fighter, and every society and every group to become a national furnace. Only in this way can Hebei have hope, and the country can be revived.</p>
<h3>Landlord Drowning in Debt Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>The electric lights in Weixian are much brighter than those in Jinan. The street lights illuminate the streets like daytime. On several relatively wide streets, pedestrians are bustling and still selling orchids. The weaving and fruit industries are relatively prosperous and developed here. However, according to people who understand the inside story, the situation is indeed getting worse year by year. Ding Shuyan, known as the richest man in Weixian, committed suicide by poisoning himself last New Year's Eve due to excessive debt, which is the most obvious example.</p>
<p>Originally, before the war, Ding Shuyan's real estate exceeded 10,000 acres and was known as "Half of Weixian is Ding's." Ding was naturally magnanimous, heroic, and righteous, and his poetry, calligraphy, and paintings were all top-notch. In his youth, he traveled to Donghua and exchanged poems and interacted with Hu Shi and Chuan Sinian. When he grew up, he was elected as a representative of the province and engaged in political circles. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he joined the guerrilla forces, donating funds and food without reservation. After the victory, due to the endless war, his debts accumulated to 400 million yuan, and he needed to pay more than one million in interest every day. Although he still owned 300 to 400 houses and more than 5,000 acres of land, because the rent collection was hopeless and there was no way to sell them, he finally swallowed four ounces of opium paste and committed suicide on New Year's Eve. Insiders said: This is not only Ding's personal tragedy, but also a sign that the industrial, commercial, and financial circles of Weixian are about to collapse. The Spring Festival is coming soon, and I don't know how many companies will fall into crisis with Ding's death!</p>
<h3>Complete Line of Jiaoji Railway (II) Departure from Weixian</h3>
<p>— Litian, Special Correspondent in Shandong</p>
<p>This newspaper's dispatch on the 11th</p>
<p>Weixian is the only city in Eastern Shandong that has not been liberated by the Communist Army. On the surface, it almost completely retains its pure inland scenery. Many of the bungalows lined up on both sides of the street from the station to the city are thatched huts, and some small inns are still posting red paper signs to attract passing travelers. The rectangular stone slabs paved on the streets that have not been completely widened are uneven due to years of disrepair, making all travelers and vehicles feel tired and arduous when passing through. Since I got off the train after 4:00 p.m., the time did not allow me to browse the street scenery, so I had to rush to visit Xia Chuzhong, the commander-in-chief of the highest military authority here.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the headquarters, General Xia was out due to some business, so Chief of Staff Tang Menghe received me first. Tang served as the director of the Changsha Police Department around the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939] and was an old acquaintance of mine. We first exchanged our situations after parting, and then he told me many actual situations inside the Communist Army, the plight of the people under the Communist Army's rule, all the gunners and part of the machine gunners in the Communist Army are Japanese prisoners, and there are also advisors from ×× in the Communist Army. In the Battle of Laizhou in November last year, we found many corpses of Japanese prisoners.</p>
<p>General Xia Chuzhong on Draining Ponds to Catch Fish</p>
<p>After about half an hour of talking, Commander Xia returned! This is General Xia Chuzhong, who participated in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War five years ago, the first, second, and third Changsha battles, and assisted General Wang Zuomin in completing the Xiangxi victory. The first impression he gave me was that he was much plumper than before. With a Hunan accent, he first asked me about my views on national affairs. Naturally, I replied without hesitation that "politics comes first." He agreed with this point completely, but he believed that the problem in China today is still "three parts military and seven parts politics." Then he told me: "The Communist Army avoids fighting hard battles in the military. They go back and forth, coming and going, and are accustomed to launching attacks. Unless they can take advantage of their numbers and have full confidence, they will never act rashly. Therefore, our garrison troops will suffer if they are not careful. In politics, a small number of core cadres are lurking in every village, trying to meet the requirements of military coordination. For this, General Xia's specific method is: the National Army has absolute confidence in fighting the regular Communist Army. Then, we should thoroughly attack the three tactics of the Communist Army. The Communist Army is like fish, and the people are water. The best way to catch all the fish and shrimp is to drain the water and strive to win over the people, organize the people, and prevent them from hiding, which is equivalent to draining the pond to catch fish. While we are developing the military, we must pay more attention to politics to counter the politics of the Communist Party. The Communist Party has farmers' associations, so we will organize relief groups to deal with them. Since the returning team has returned to their hometown, it has lost its effect. We must use this resource to connect one person with five people, and then connect to twenty-five people. Then connect to one hundred and twenty-five people, gather them together, and they will become a permanently stable force. This force is the most basic force of the people."</p>
<p>General Xia was very talkative. He concluded that we should try to organize as many returning teams as possible in the recaptured areas to allow them to reform themselves and avoid killing them.</p>

<h3>Supplementary Conditions for Civil Litigation - Article 12 Impacts Society Theory</h3>
<p>— Li Qun</p>
<p>Recently, Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Litigation states that the court should fairly determine whether to increase or decrease payments if the original effect is obviously unfair. The Four Banks' deposit case, with a precedent of repaying the principal a thousandfold, has caused widespread panic and instability throughout society. Financial experts, legal scholars, economists, and prominent politicians in Shanghai have expressed their opinions in newspaper forums. Aside from those who were somewhat biased and arbitrary, most discussions focused on financial, legal, and banking perspectives. Only one gentleman mentioned the relationship to farmers. In fact, it has a significant impact on the entire society, not just farmers, yet those who discussed it failed to deeply examine this aspect, which is truly surprising.</p>
<p>Today's commentators all start with national debt, arguing that if private debts are repaid a thousandfold, the nation should do the same. They argue that even though the country is poor now, adding an expenditure would not have a major impact, merely increasing the burden on the people. This would force those who do not hold debt notes to fulfill obligations to those who do, which is hardly fair. Furthermore, legal tender banknotes are also the nation's debt. If people hold pre-war banknotes or customs gold units, can they demand to exchange them for recent banknotes at an increased rate?</p>
<p>The reason for repaying old debts at an increased rate is that prices were low in the past but have risen today. If it is decided that pre-war debts should be increased, what about the first year after the war (1938), when prices actually fell? Prices rose slightly in 1939 and then increased annually, ten times, dozens of times, hundreds of times, thousands of times, even several thousand times, reaching their peak on the eve of the enemy's surrender. Therefore, fairness must extend to all years after the war. If one wants to seek fairness by reflecting the value effect, then it must be calculated based on the annual price of a certain type of commodity. Over time, the question of how much prices have changed becomes very complex, especially for banks. Their annual inflows and outflows are numerous, and a retroactive calculation would overturn everything. Increasing repayments to others and increasing demands from others would become too numerous to rationally handle. Moreover, since the victory, prices have risen significantly again. Should this also be increased? If a loan is doubled today, and prices fluctuate next year, should it be calculated according to commodity prices? If prices fall, can the principal be reduced? If it is said that the current law is designed for old debts and will not be questioned in the future, then the effect is considered for the former but not the latter. Where is the so-called fairness in that? If it is also calculated according to commodities, it will lead to endless losses. Regardless of past or present, the unit of borrowing is legal tender, not commodities, but repayment must be based on the value effect, regardless of the unit. If the law states that the effect is obviously unfair, how will that disrupt the financial system?</p>
<p>Banks operate by accepting deposits and making loans, earning a small profit. Now, if they suddenly have to repay people a thousandfold, is that appropriate? Furthermore, some banks are financially weak, which will lead to bankruptcies, further disrupting the financial system.</p>
<p>Although, for national debt, the nation is large and there is naturally no problem. For bank deposits, the banks are wealthy,</p>
<p>Even if repayments are doubled, and even if the procedures are cumbersome, it seems that all can cope with it reluctantly except a few financially weak small banks. However, the disturbance among ordinary people concerns the entire society. All the commentators have not mentioned this, how strange it is!</p>
<p>Especially for farmers in rural areas, the relationship is extremely close. The creditors to whom they owe debts are often local bullies. If the law of doubling repayments exists, even if the court can make discretionary adjustments, the rumor of doubling repayments will provide an excuse for those who want to oppress the good. The poor and helpless will have no choice but to accept it silently. Soon, a small old debt of several hundred yuan will lead to the seizure of their cattle, sheep, and fields. Therefore, the legislation cannot be taken care of casually, and this is not only for farmers.</p>
<p>In today's society, who does not have both claims and debts? After the United States' silver purchase policy before the war, the money supply was extremely tight, leading to a national recession and bankruptcies of industrial and commercial businesses. The number of private debts for daily expenses is unknown. Furthermore, the country has suffered from war and invasion. Since the eight-year War of Resistance, the pressure of rising prices has been such that, unless they are major traitors or war profiteers who hoard goods, ordinary law-abiding people are increasingly in dire straits, living off their savings and increasing their debt. Even those who are able to run businesses or have skills that can be used, or who still have some remaining property, can barely make a living. Since the national crisis, there are many such people in society. If you say they are poor, they can still live or still have some status, or even still have some property. If you say they are rich, their lives are extremely difficult. There are already the most people of this kind, and there are even more who are not as good as them. From the perspective of the creditor, due to the low value of the currency, they have a "can gain or can lose" attitude, and do not want to add more pressure. The debtor, on the other hand, tries hard to economize in order to prepare for repayment, for anyone who is not completely helpless will be concerned about their integrity. Both sides can resolve things peacefully and sincerely. But now, suddenly, there is a law of doubling repayments. Because the multiplier effect turns small amounts into large amounts, who would not want to sue and aggressively collect in order to obtain this large amount of wealth? They will spare no effort to pursue it, but those who are in debt from before will not be able to cope. In the end, after being forced to litigate, the actual gains will be limited, and what they get will only be a large worthless check. On the debtor's side, they could have preserved their integrity and resolved things, but now they are suddenly burdened by the litigation resulting from the doubled amount. Their houses will be sealed and their furniture will be auctioned off, but it will not be enough. They will have to declare bankruptcy, causing their elderly mother and beloved wife to lose their support, and their children to lose their education. Their integrity and reputation will be permanently lost. How tragic is that! If the debtor had suffered this plight without the doubling of the debt, it would be tragic, but also appropriate. Now, if the law had not doubled the debt, nothing would have happened. If this tragedy occurs because the law doubles the debt, then it is the fault of the legislator. The law wants to cherish the old creditor's rights, but only makes them exhaust their energy to litigate and gain little. It wants to punish the old debtors, but it doubles or triples the debt and inevitably leads them to bankruptcy, even to the destruction of their families. How can they bear it? Their debts in the past were unavoidable. They did not borrow money to hoard goods, but the law treats them as if they did so with the aim to hoard goods and raise prices. Is that not excessive? Furthermore, some people who were debtors in the past also had some claims at the same time, and some people who were creditors also had some debts at the same time. Therefore, under this law, there will be lawsuits and demands everywhere. All can be stopped but the situation is changed beyond recognition, because the multiplier effect has intensified it. It is foreseeable that the entire society will be in turmoil. It is like throwing a huge bomb into still water, causing waves and overflows, causing large and small boats to collide with each other in the vortex, eventually injuring the large ones and capsizing the small ones. Alas! It is too much. As the saying goes, "There is nothing wrong in the world, but fools make trouble for themselves." Is this what it means?</p>
<p>Those who govern and teach the country consider stabilizing the people's livelihood to be the best policy. It has never been heard that agitating the people's livelihood is a good policy. Teaching the people to resolve disputes and promote concession is the foundation of pure social customs. It has never been heard that guiding them to engage in vigorous lawsuits is a good thing. Moreover, the politics of all countries today emphasize society and the people's livelihood. The ancient sages had the teaching of not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality. Therefore, for those who make laws for the country, rather than increasing the wealth of those who have, why not help those who lack to recover? This is the equality of inequality.</p>
<p>Moreover, the multitude of disputes among the people is not auspicious for the country. I read Yan Ze's "Evolution and Ethics" when I was young and was impressed by the saying that one must eliminate internal strife before winning external strife. Therefore, Duke Xiao of Qin made the people timid in private quarrels and brave in public battles, while King Wen of Zhou promoted benevolence and had the people cease litigation and concede land boundaries. Although the methods of hegemony were different, the goal was the same: to make the people cease internal strife and strive for the public good. At present, the country needs to revive everything and must rely on the people's unity of mind and effort, collective wisdom, and concerted effort. Why set so many laws to stir up the people's hearts? It is said, "Hearing lawsuits is like being a human, it is essential to make there be no lawsuits." Now there are courts of mediation in civil law to reduce lawsuits and resolve disputes. The intention is good. Why, in this supplementary regulation for civil litigation, add this particularly extraordinary Article 12, which, although intended to be fair, is unknowingly stirring up disputes among the people and making the entire society uneasy. This is truly a major mistake of the legislator. Although the judiciary can sometimes exercise discretion in making judgments and determining the severity of the situation, the fundamental law is such that the people will inevitably engage in disputes because of this. One case will be right, and another case will be wrong, the situations will be completely different, and it will be difficult for the case law to comply with the equality of the value effect. The so-called basis of effect is to disregard the legal tender standard and shake it, turning it into the commodity value at any time. Currency or commodities? The people have nowhere to go. Alas, alas, the poor masses will be unable to win lawsuits and will be unable to stop the disturbances! Therefore, to remedy this mistake, the judiciary's creation of more case law will not be able to achieve it. Only the Legislative Yuan can abolish Article 12, so that the law remains based on legal tender, and commodity values remain separate, clearly defined and not mixed together. This will eliminate such unnecessary disputes and will not increase social unrest.</p>
<p>I recently heard a suggestion that the highest authorities intend to amend the law to increase compound interest. This would not shake the status of legal tender, but the so-called compound interest would still have to be repaid at hundreds or thousands of times the original amount. This will have the same impact on social unrest as discussed above. The debts of the general public are often due to the pre-war recession and the pressure of rising living expenses since the war, and they have not yet recovered. How can they bear this? It is the way to disorder to force them when they know they cannot bear it. As for whether the existing banks have the ability to cope with this, it is another question and not the focus of this discussion.</p>
<p>I am writing this because the viewpoints of the commentators place too much emphasis on banks, etc., and do not consider the harm to the entire society. (End)</p>

<h3>Splendor in the Sky Special Edition</h3>
<p>— Ma Bolang</p>
<p>"Splendor in the Sky," originally titled "Ziegfeld Follies," was produced by MGM in August 1945.</p>
<p>MGM's musical films consistently feature dazzling colors, grand and innovative sets. "Bathing Beauty," "The Ziegfeld Girl," and "Yolanda and the Thief" are all like that. "Splendor in the Sky" is an even more anticipated gathering of red-hot stars. Its subject matter still centers on the stories of the sensational Ziegfeld Follies in America. The role of the boss, Florenz Ziegfeld, is once again played by the veteran star William Powell. This time, he was exceptionally invited to strengthen the cast. He is the husband of the late blonde bombshell Jean Harlow. The film is divided into twelve short skits, featuring songs, dances, and comedy, each starring several major stars. Filming took three years and employed two sets of photography teams to shoot a total of seventeen combined scenes and forty-five individual scenes. In addition, seventy-five female tailors were hired to sew four hundred gorgeous costumes for the major stars and Ziegfeld girls.</p>
<p>The cast is composed of MGM's rising stars, gathered together. The king of dance, Fred Astaire, lends his support, starring in "Limehouse Blues." He announced his retirement at the end of last year and will no longer dance. This is a rare opportunity to see him. His partner is MGM's new dance star, Lucille Bremer, who made her debut in the 1945 technicolor musical "Yolanda and the Thief." With her beautiful appearance, Life magazine featured her photo on the cover and published a full-page photo of her in a bubble bath. Red-haired beauty Lucille Ball, the star of "The Ziegfeld Girl," leads the performance in the "Merry-Go-Round" scene. Lucille and a group of Ziegfeld girls ride snow-white handsome horses, singing and dancing lightly, filled with spring. Esther Williams, the bathing beauty from "Bathing Beauty," has a novel and surprising performance here, wearing a sparkling gold and silver swimsuit, dancing ballet underwater. The patterns are new and never seen before. Ballet is the most wonderful art in the world. The stage performance must be transcendentally trained. Once underwater, the dancer is suppressed by the water. To be able to do such graceful dance moves is extremely dazzling. Kathryn Grayson, the female lead of "Thousands Cheer," "Ziegfeld Follies," and "Anchors Aweigh," sings the theme song "Beauty." Her singing voice has a different flavor and is deeply captivating. MGM's darling Judy Garland plays a movie star who is bothered by reporters. She is one of America's top ten box office stars in recent years and has remained consistently popular. Some worry that after she grows into a young woman, her songs and dances will not have a future, but "Meet Me in St. Louis" has good results. Gene Kelly, the male lead in "Thousands Cheer," also has a wonderful performance. His attractive appearance in "Christmas Holiday" has long been established. His dance skills can be seen in "Cover Girl" and "The Ziegfeld Girl." With Fred Astaire's retirement and George Murphy's conservative silence, Gene Kelly will be the boss. The old rogue Victor Moore from "Star Spangled Rhythm," veteran villain star Edward Arnold, and rising comedian Rags Ragland play comedic roles. Lina Romay, a famous singer from South America, is renowned in America. Her skin is slightly dark, and her tone is different from Carmen Miranda's, singing "Love" and "Liza," which are relatively gentle. Keenan Wynn, who starred in the best comedic skit "Number Please," is a good friend of MGM's red-hot young star Van Johnson. He is a famous figure in Hollywood, and his comedy is highly praised by Americans. MGM attaches great importance to him.</p>
<p>The film is directed by Vincente Minnelli, Judy Garland's new husband. Among MGM's and Hollywood's rising directors, he is one of the most accomplished. In "Meet Me in St. Louis," the secret whispers of a young couple after the meeting, and the singing concert with flower clusters on the streetcar, all hold warm memories, the life that we have lived through. "The Clock," one of the best films of 1945, and "Undercurrent," the recent work of Robert Taylor and Katharine Hepburn who returned to the screen, are his glorious milestones. He is a very promising director.</p>

<h3>About Ziegfeld</h3>
<p>— Bo Ning</p>
<p>The story of Ziegfeld is the story of Broadway because his life's work has been rendered into the most glorious page in the history of American song and dance.</p>
<p>Ziegfeld's era was the most extravagant era in America. It was an era when chorus girls could earn large rewards simply by virtue of their beauty, and it was also an era when diamond kings used ten-carat diamonds as buttons on their clothes. Ziegfeld never treated money as a serious matter. It came today, and it left tomorrow, without him even batting an eyelid. When he failed in a business venture and lost as much as two million dollars, he would only say to his beloved wife with a careless tone: "I've failed again!"</p>
<p>Currently, there are still many well-known people in the American film and dance industry who are former members of Ziegfeld's troupe. Comedy talents such as Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers, Marilyn Miller, and Lillee Fields were all created by him. Also, Virginia Bruce, a star who was extremely popular before the war, was one of them. In addition, he discovered many beautiful and charming showgirls.</p>
<p>Ziegfeld was a well-mannered and elegant gentleman, kind by nature, and slightly superstitious. He was the first person to infuse truth, goodness, and beauty into opera. Beauties elevated their status because of his selection and promotion, and his extravagant and grand "Ziegfeld Follies" undoubtedly created the highest peak in the beautiful song and dance world.</p>
<p>The chorus girls in his troupe were all carefully selected by him, and they were called "Ziegfeld Girls." This was the focus of each of his operas, and he tried every means to make them as perfect as possible. As for the structure of the story, it was not what he valued.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 19xx, the Ziegfeld Follies has produced many masterpieces over the years, which have stirred up countless audiences. His three operas, "The Three Musketeers," "Rosalie," and "Show Boat," were performed simultaneously on Broadway, which simply fascinated the men and women of the entire United States.</p>
<p>Ziegfeld was very casual (and therefore often unfaithful). He rarely smiled, so his friends and subordinates called him "Cold Face" behind his back. However, he was extremely hospitable and enthusiastic, sometimes generously giving people ten thousand US dollars at once, without even asking for any guarantees.</p>
<p>He loved making phone calls and sending telegrams the most. Besides appreciating beautiful women, this was another thing he loved.</p>
<p>Ziegfeld is dead, and Broadway's fame has gradually been replaced by Hollywood, but the name Ziegfeld has not been obliterated by the tides of the times. Even Hollywood filmmakers cannot forget him, repeatedly picking up his deeds or his extravagant style to make films. Ziegfeld is, after all, the cornerstone of Broadway!</p>
<h3>No Story Structure</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>"Splendor in the Sky" has a bold feature: no story structure. This is a magnificent musical and dance work on the screen, with one program following another, the scenes are extravagant and gorgeous, the colors are beautiful and dazzling, but the story structure has been abandoned.</p>
<p>Because the performance of the Ziegfeld Follies at that time did not attach the most importance to this point, "Splendor in the Sky" abandoned this point to express its loyalty to Ziegfeld.</p>

<h3>Lifelike New-Style Puppet Show Without Wires</h3>
<p>— Zuo Xi</p>
<p>In "Splendor in the Sky," a group of lively, lifelike puppets without wires appear on the screen for the first time. These eight-inch-long dwarfs show the vivid picture unique to movies, just like real people.</p>
<p>This is Burr Tillstrom's latest style of puppet show.</p>
<p>Movie audiences will see the former Ziegfeld Follies stars dancing on the screen again. These puppets are made of a secret material that is very elastic, so their movements closely resemble those of real people. When the puppets laugh, even the corners of their mouths can show dimples. In order to show these subtle effects, only seven feet of film can be shot each day for certain dance shots. The "Legs" dance, which lasts for one minute on the screen, takes fifteen days to shoot. Five hundred puppets are used to perform the different movements of the six puppets.</p>
<p>Tillstrom's unique skill was learned from the Parisian art world. He studied sculpture with the famous artist Bourdelle, and in 1924 he held a solo exhibition in his hometown of Chicago. He began his career as a puppet master in the puppet show "From Morning to Midnight." His first performance of a puppet show that closely resembled real people was in a short film at the Petroleum Exhibition at the New York World's Fair. In 1943, he joined MGM Studios to film "Splendor in the Sky." After thirteen months of hard work, he used his puppets to create a small history of the former Ziegfeld Follies stars. Among them, Eddie Cantor sings, and Will Rogers dances with ropes.</p>
<p>Costumes and characters are equally important. The clothes worn by Tillstrom's puppets are specially designed to imitate the original Ziegfeld costumes. Even their hair has been specially styled, and their eyebrows have to be curled every day!</p>
<h3>Splendor in the Sky - All Kinds of Colors</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>"Splendor in the Sky" is immersed in a lively atmosphere from beginning to end. In this film, Ziegfeld is dead and living a comfortable life in heaven. This role is played by William Powell, while other comedic stars Rags Ragland, Victor Moore, and Keenan Wynn replace the old-time Will Rogers, Leon Errol, etc.</p>
<p>In terms of song and dance, the "Dance Saint" Fred Astaire is now responsible for three scenes, two of which partner with the new star Lucille Bremer, and one is a tap dance with Gene Kelly. The dance steps are novel, and the costumes are unique. In addition, there is Esther Williams' swimming, Judy Garland and Kathryn Grayson's singing, each song is pleasing and fascinating, plus Lucille Ball's dance drama. It's really a competition of beauty, and the beauty is endless.</p>
<h3>The Brilliant Silver Stars in a Kaleidoscope: Four Angels of Splendid Paradise</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>(1) Lucille Bremer was born in Amityville, New York. At the age of twelve, she began performing in Billy Reed's dance troupe. At sixteen, she gained fame at Radio City Music Hall in New York, leading to her being appreciated by MGM. Her first appearance on the silver screen was as Judy Garland's older sister in "Meet Me in St. Louis." Recently, she has often collaborated with dance king Fred Astaire, with new works including "Yolanda and the Thief." In "Splendid Paradise," she is also the dance king's partner. She is five feet four inches tall, weighs 111 pounds, has red hair, and azure eyes. She enjoys walking, swimming, and watching movies.</p>
<p>(2) Esther Williams is now a sweetheart beloved by American soldiers worldwide. She is a Californian. When she was unable to speak, her mother would place her on the beach, letting the waves impact her body. This is why she has such swimming achievements today. She once wanted to participate in the Olympic swimming competition, but due to the outbreak of World War II, she had to abandon this plan. In 1940, after graduating from high school, she worked as a saleswoman in a sporting goods store. In the summer of the same year, she met a producer from MGM, who appreciated her and signed a contract. Her first work was "Bathing Beauty," and "Million Dollar Mermaid" is her most popular film. In the current "Splendid Paradise," she once again performs water ballet.</p>
<p>(3) Judy Garland's parents worked in a musical troupe. At the age of three, her father asked her to perform on stage. Later, she continuously performed with her two older sisters. As a child, she aspired to be a lawyer. One summer, while singing somewhere, she was discovered by a talent scout from MGM because her singing was so good. The next day, she appeared with Deanna Durbin in "Every Sunday Afternoon." Since then, she has had smooth sailing, successively co-starring with Mickey Rooney in the Hardy Family film series. Her recent works include "Ziegfeld Follies," "Till the Clouds Roll By," and "Words and Music."</p>
<p>(4) Kathryn Grayson is young, beautiful, and has a melodious singing voice. Since signing a contract with MGM, she has undergone three years of extremely rigorous training. Whether it is vocal music, expression, makeup, posture, etc., she has diligently studied everything before emerging. Her first film was as the lead in Pasternak's "Seven Sweethearts," creating a sensation. In "Splendid Paradise," she headlines with the song "Bella Signorina," which implicitly shows the importance placed on her.</p>

<h3>From Wu Changshuo to Qi Baishi</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>A few days ago, painter Qi Baishi went south, holding a painting exhibition with his works, which once caused a sensation in the art world. Many newspapers and periodicals have commented on Qi's works. In these commentaries, Wu Changshuo is often mentioned in comparison, referring to "Southern Wu and Northern Qi." Indeed, Wu and Qi each have their respective significant positions in the modern Chinese painting history. However, their accomplishments are different, just like Liang Qichao and Zhang Shizhao, Zhou Shuren and Guo Moruo, whose articles each have their own style and unique characteristics, and cannot be viewed in the same way.</p>
<p>Let me first talk about Wu Changshuo's poetry, painting, and seal carving. Xie Yucen said that Wu's creative spirit was: "Born in the late Qing Dynasty, his poetry coincided with the surge of the Tongguang Min-Gan schools; his painting coincided with the popularity of the Shanyin and Yuanhu styles; his calligraphy followed An Wu and Yi Zheng; and his seal carving followed the Eight Masters of Xiling." Indeed, Wu was untouched by all of these at that time, never restricted by them, and was able to pioneer his own path. One day, Hu Gongshou said to Wu: "Your interest in painting seems too late." Because Wu began to learn painting after the age of thirty. Ren Bonian, who was present at the time, followed by saying: "If one has talent in the heart and rhythm in the brush, what does it matter if it is late!" Yang Jianshan also said: "Painting does not come from painting, but is based on poetry, writing, and bronze inscriptions. Accumulating deep strength can carry a large boat, which means understanding the supreme Zen." It can be seen that Wu's works all have a realm and meaning that ancient people did not have, and form a unique genre. He is able to learn and change, entering first and then exiting, which fits the modern concept of the true essence of creation.</p>
<p>The above is an objective commentary. What about Wu's own subjective thoughts? Wu's painting poems say: "The ink escapes the hand, pushing the stele together; tadpole old moss, clerical branches and trunks. Who can recognize this, like with Yong!" He also said: "Saying it is seal script, not painting." And also said: "The scorpion changes into twisting branches." Clearly, Wu advocated and practiced using seal script and clerical script calligraphy to paint. Wu's comments on seal carving say: "The disease of counterfeiting the ancients cannot be cured; the traces of Deng are densely displayed and abandoned. Caressing day and night, if there is gain, outside of Chen and Deng, there is still no merit. How many people in the world learn from the Qin and Han dynasties? But seeking resemblance leads to fatigue... Believing that the knife reaches where the intention must be, leisurely and skillful, very comfortable." He also said: "The iron script is directly permitted by the Prime Minister of Qin, shaking off the shackles of Chen and Deng." It can be seen that he not only changed some of the original forms when writing the Stone Drum Inscriptions but also wanted to "create his own antiquity" when carving seals, striving not to rely on others. For example, when painting, he often inscribed "Learning from Chen Yu Fan, Li Fu Tang, Wu Rang Zhi, Zhang Meng Gao," which shows that his painting is only occasionally involved in their interests and is by no means a complete imitation of a certain person.</p>
<p>Regarding his own poetry writing, Wu said: "My poems express my own nature and feelings, without knowing whether they are different or the same." His friend Shi Xuchen described his poems as: "...All expressing his nature and feelings, not compromising with the present nor forcing himself to imitate the past, which is what is meant by being able to establish himself!" Dong Qichang spoke well of calligraphy, "In the beginning, it must be in accordance with the ancients, and later it must be separated from the ancients." Accordance is exploring the rules (techniques) of the ancients, while separation is expressing (displaying) one's own spirit. From Wu's own words about his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and seal carving, we can use Huang Shangu's two lines of poetry, "Following others' plans will always be behind others, creating one's own style is the beginning of approaching the truth," as a very appropriate explanation of his absolute and relative artistic writing.</p>
<p>Wu's paintings mostly feature pine, plum, chrysanthemum, bamboo, orchid, and stones. He occasionally creates miscellaneous flowers and birds. His landscape style is very high, but he rarely paints landscapes after middle age, and he paints the least portraits. His freehand flowers have vigorous and elegant brushstrokes, slightly resembling Xu Qing Teng and Chen Bai Yang. However, his ancient, simple, profound, and rich charm traces back to the Yuan and Song dynasties, and even to the Wu Liang Shrine portraits, with wonderful transformations. His composition and coloring are truly as Shen Zipei said, "Containing ten thousand strange things in his chest." His use of ink is both dry and wet, with natural shades, clear and refined, deeply understanding the ancient saying "Moist containing spring rain, dry cracked autumn wind," especially in places where "dirt shows purity, and purity contains dirt," which is not something that those who only know how to smear can comprehend the fun of. He once said, "Painting should be bold in the brushstrokes and careful in the finishing touches." If painting is compared to writing, then bold brushstrokes are equivalent to circulating the chapter, and careful finishing touches are equivalent to pursuing and refining the sentence. Therefore, his paintings can show precision in the wildness, clarity in the richness, and the inner meaning and outer appearance seem to be in the painting and yet not in the painting.</p>
<p>Qi Baishi's family background is of a different class than Wu Changshuo's. Of the ancients, Qi most despises the Four Wangs (Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Yuanqi), and most admires Shi Tao, while learning from Xu Qing Teng and Bada Shanren. Of the modern people, he only loves Wu Changshuo. Qi has a seven-character quatrain that says: "Qing Teng and Xue Ge are far from the mundane; Old Fu (Wu Changshuo's pseudonym) is extraordinarily talented. I want to be a running dog in the underworld (Zheng Banqiao has a seal: "Zheng Bian, the running dog under the Qing Teng door"), rotating under the doors of the three masters." It can be seen that Qi's admiration for Wu is such that he regards Xu Qing Teng, Bada Shanren, and Wu Changshuo as three-in-one teachers.</p>
<p>Qi's works, poetry, painting, and seal carving each have their own fields. His preface to his poems says: "When it is hot summer, sweat flows down the back, green ants and flies share wild foxes, and cave rats are neighbors. Most of what is stored in the collection directly expresses my feelings. I have no time to write thousands of words with a painful heart and hone myself, learning to write like a otter offering fish!" His mourning poems and quatrains: "Singing loudly to ask for inscriptions, who else are the heroes of the green forest?" Burning draft poems, "Not knowing many characters, but wanting to write poetry." These poems and essays can represent his personality and style.</p>
<p>This time Qi came to Beijing and Shanghai, some people said that Qi is the only leader in the Chinese painting world today. Besides Qi's age, this statement seems excessive in terms of art. But at the same time, some people criticized Qi's works as artistic traitors, wild fox Zen, and also avoided siding with the same party and attacking the different, and worshiped the ancients as idols, forcing people to be slaves to the ancients, hindering the genius of creation. Frankly speaking, in terms of art, both Wu Changshuo and Qi Baishi have jumped out of the shackles of the ancients and displayed their skills. Although Wu and Qi's accomplishments are different, their achievements are also different, but they have already pioneered their own paths and each has its own unique characteristics. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The lives and actions of artists are often very special. Qi is no exception and has his quirks. Jin Xihou listed him, Wu Peifu, and Sai Jinhua as the three eccentrics of Yanshan. Qi himself and Xuechang and Richang were considered the three eccentrics of Xicheng, saying that they were equal to the Eight Eccentrics of Xicheng, such as Zhao Zishu and Dexiang, during the Tongguang period. Yang Chongzi, however, regarded Qi, Zhang Wushi, Jichan Monk, and Shen Shanren as the four strange people of Xiangtan. Whether strange or different, his temperament and life are different from ordinary people, and his art is naturally special.</p>
<p>Qi's poetry, painting, and seal carving are all self-reliant, creating a new path from hard work. After decades of hard work, he has achieved his own unique works, neither erasing the past nor trending with the times, purely creative. This pioneering (revolutionary) spirit is admirable. Although these rough lines, crude branches and leaves, thick vermilion and black ink are close to rude and vulgar, we must know that this is Qi's characteristic, and it is also what makes Qi's works different from other artists. We must know that Qi's background is as a carpenter. A carpenter with such achievements, able to write poetry, paint, write calligraphy, and carve seals, is certainly not an ordinary person. We must never use the model of a scholar-official to confine a talented, persevering, and creative artist. Just as the painter Giotto, who was as famous as the poet Dante, was a shepherd boy, and Gao Jianfu, a painter from Lingnan, was originally an apprentice in a medicinal herb store, they could not hinder his artistic progress.</p>
<p>In the history of Chinese painting, both Wu and Qi have their own places, which is not a problem. However, Wu and Qi's works were successful in themselves, but this achievement only existed in themselves. As the saying goes, "Those who obtain it live, those who learn it die." Then, "The world values their art, and I value their people." Why? Because those who learn their art are often toiling without success, mostly failing, and not easily achieving anything. At most, they can only get a little superficial knowledge. There is no need to explain the mysteries, because each has his own talent, thoughts, environment, and different accomplishments. Even if they want to learn it, it is in vain. This is what distinguishes Wu Changshuo from Qi Baishi, and it is also the reason why they each have their own achievements.</p>
<h3>On Bonsai</h3>
<p>— Dong Shuyu</p>
<p>Although bonsai is a small art, the types are varied, and good compositions are hard to come by. In addition to the difficulty of selecting materials, the creator must not only be familiar with the personality of the plants, but also possess the cultivation of a painter, traveler, and connoisseur, and have a comprehensive artistic talent, coupled with skilled techniques, in order to be successful. "Bonsai" is a general term, and its botanical category includes artistic potted plants and tree-stone bonsai, and its stone category includes potted stones and landscape bonsai.</p>
<p>Each of the above four has its own characteristics. Artistic potted plants focus on planting, and horticulturalists with artistic cultivation are often good at it. In addition to planting, remodeling, and maintenance techniques, the appropriate materials and beautiful postures are the most important. The people of Fusang (Japan) have vigorously promoted it, and there are many fine works. Some people do not hesitate to spend years of effort to cultivate and cultivate, only to create a scene. Artistic potted plants are mostly based on pine, cypress, and evergreen plants, taking their long period of appreciation, and the ancient and elegant tree trunks are considered precious. With the artist's skills, processing and transformation are carried out to make the posture sinuous and twisted, or soaring and upright, and long-term maintenance is required. Looking at it, the spirit is invigorated, and small stones are added between the vigorous green to supplement the lack of scenery. The form of the basin, whether round or square, tall or short, color, and porcelain quality, should also be matched with the shape and color of the plant to be called ancient and lovely.</p>
<p>Tree-stone bonsai is a three-dimensional landscape painting, selecting plants that resemble trees and are suitable for bonsai, matching them with small stones, and building soil blocks into a prototype of mountains and plains; or embellishing them with small pavilions and figures, and lining them with green grass, such as green moss, as grassland. The proportions of trees, stones, and figures must be accurate, and the position of each grass and tree must be appropriate; and the color matching must be clear, elegant, and detached from vulgarity. The creator will not be competent if he does not have the artistic conception of a painter. The pots used should be shallow. The above two are mainly trees, with soil and stones as embellishments.</p>
<p>Potted stone is the simplest of the bonsai, and it is also the so-called Qing Gong in painting. That is, placing stone blocks in shallow water porcelain pots. It is extremely difficult to find stone blocks with high style. The most superior are those with natural shapes, followed by those that need to be slightly processed, and the momentum should be carefully reworked; such as distant mountains, such as island shapes, etc., or taking small scenes, planting a few irises in the gaps of the exquisite stones, which is also a clear and beautiful state and full of interest. Facing each other on the desk is enough to be pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Landscape bonsai has a broad artistic conception, like a natural painting of a huge landscape. This type of production is mainly based on stone. Those stones that have the shape of peaks and ridges must first be carved and cut to make their artistic conception match; then piece them together and put them together to form a scene. It is even more difficult to construct huge blocks. If all the carving is lost to nature, there is no natural interest, and it becomes a veritable rockery. Therefore, before a stone is completed, it should be carefully observed, neither forgetting nor helping, and it is too late to regret after rash construction. The nature of the stone is different, such as sand accumulation, tree accumulation, petrified wood, etc., which belong to loose quality. Other Ying stone, Shi Xu, volcanic stone, etc., are all hard in nature. If the carving is not good, there will be obvious axes, so it is necessary to be familiar with the techniques of stone workers and bonding. In addition to the texture of the stone, the arrangement of grass and trees must be clear. And the most important thing is the layout of the whole scene, with a broad mind, and then there will be a superb composition. It is not like a painter painting, with wonderful scenes in his heart, which can be rendered at will. Pot art is limited by location and limited by material. Setting up a scene is not easy. Embellishments are appropriate, not too much, not monotonous, and supplemented by suitable materials, there will be magnificent and beautiful works. Lying down and wandering in a pot, leisurely and contented, the beauty of the scenery is like directly entering the painting realm of the Song and Yuan dynasties, but fine works are hard to come by and can only be encountered but not sought.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of various bonsai. In addition, there is also a paper-made bonsai, which is made of waste paper and oil blue mixture, and then colored separately. It can be used at will. The method is popular in Dongying (Japan), specializing in making garden models, which is not within the scope of this discussion.</p>
<h3>Talking about Guan Liang's Recent Works</h3>
<p>— Ni Yide</p>
<p>A dilapidated old truck is most likely to break down when traveling on a winding and steep mountain road. The engine often emits a heavy, low, hoarse cry and can no longer move forward. When the driver and assistant jump out of the car and patiently repair it, the passengers wait anxiously, which is an extremely unbearable pain. But for a traveling painter, a painter who can discover beauty no matter where he is, it is an excellent opportunity. He can often get valuable harvests at this time and acquire painting materials that are not easy to find at ordinary times.</p>
<p>I guess that many of Guan Liang's recent works were produced in this kind of occasion. That is a kind of desolation and desolation in the deep mountains and big swamps, with a bit of terrifying wildness. People who often live in the plains of Jiangnan can't imagine the scenery in the deep mountains of southwest and northwest China. Thousands of towering peaks surround you in a gloomy core; looking down from thousands of feet of cliffs, the bottom of the ravine silently flows with cold streams; in the dense forest, you occasionally find one or two houses inhabited by mountain dwellers, who are always living a life forgotten by the world; in the lush grass and thorns, it seems that ferocious beasts and tigers suddenly appear; sometimes groups of donkeys, horses and large carts roar past, breaking the silence of the four mountains. Every traveler on the road enjoys this curious appreciation, and the secrets between these deep mountains are now all included in Guan Liang's paintings.</p>
<p>A clever painter always likes to adopt painting materials that are suitable for his own expression, and that kind of subject matter also affects his expression techniques, creating the painter's special style. Guan Liang, he is a person with special achievements in the Chinese painting world, so to understand his works, one must explore his research route. Regarding this, I know a little bit. His painting starts from the standpoint of modern painting after Cézanne. That is to abandon the explanatory and dry writing, explore the rhythm of color in nature, use the relationship of light and dark to express the transition of distance, use deformation to emphasize the characteristics of objects, and seek the unity of the competition surface from the mutual harmony and echo between color, sound and shape. To achieve no technique by technique, to avoid general techniques and pursue special techniques. Then, he discovered that the works of the Shitao school in Chinese painting have a place that coincides with modern Western painting. Shitao, with his years of experience living in the mountains and forests, understood the mysteries of nature, and expressed the sound of mountains and waters with a sense of reality with simplified lines and the body rhythm of ink, reaching the highest realm of Chinese painting, and having a commonality with Western modern painting. Guan Liang, he understood this kind of charm in the picture and cleverly isolated it in Western paintings, creating his own style.</p>
<p>In order to suit his kind of expression, he began a long journey, starting from Kunming, arriving in Chongqing, traveling west to Chengdu, climbing Qingcheng, Emei, turning to the northwest, exiting Jianmen, crossing the Qinling Mountains, arriving in Chang'an, climbing Taiyi, then heading north to Lanzhou, then returning south to Xi'an, traveling east along the Longhai Line, climbing the summit of Mount Hua, exiting Hangu Pass, climbing Longmen, overlooking the scenery of the Yellow River, and then returning to Chongqing and heading south to Guiyang. His footprints almost covered all areas of the Great Rear during the Anti-Japanese War, and he also described all the famous mountains, rivers, scenic spots and wonders of these places.</p>
<p>After the restoration, it is difficult for people to have the opportunity to travel inland China along the highway. I think, anyone who has had this kind of experience, when they see his works, will definitely be able to evoke distant memories of passing through deep mountains and big swamps. And people who have not been there can also appreciate the great and dangerous natural realm hidden in the interior of China through his artistic expression.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Gu Xiaohu</p>
<p>Zhang Zhenlu of Baoshan specializes in the Eight Methods, and his cursive script is especially valued by the world. The author has long admired him, and yesterday, accompanied by a friend from the literary society, visited Zhang's residence. It happened that Zhang was writing couplets with vigorous strokes, and many people were gathered around to watch. The author expressed his intention to request calligraphy and stood by to observe. The couplets he created included true script, cursive script, clerical script, seal script, running script, and Wei script, all with new sentences attached to the name of the inscription, composing and writing without a draft.</p>
<p>A guest mentioned that contemporary calligraphers write cursive script with both hands. Zhang smiled, placed the couplet paper on the table, took a brush from the holder, dipped it slightly, and then operated both wrists simultaneously. He said to the people, "I have a leisure seal with the inscription 'Not saying I can do it, but willing to learn it.'"</p>
<p>Admiration gathered, and interest sparked. He was asked to write another couplet. Zhang easily stood to the left of the table and wrote the upper couplet sideways; then he returned to his original position and wrote the lower couplet upside down. For another couplet, he dipped the brush fully in ink and wrote quickly with his eyes closed, without any regrets for not using up all the ink, and his spirit was particularly vibrant. Zhang threw down the brush and laughed, saying that this was just an occasional game and not the proper way.</p>
<p>Afterward, he led the guests into a room, full of beautiful things, like an exhibition. Regarding cursive script, he said that those who followed the rules word by word, he knew to be Zhang Cao (clerical cursive); those who wrote cursive script with clerical methods, he knew to be Cao Li (cursive clerical); those who could be slightly distinguished were probably Xiao Cao (small cursive); and those who seemed mad and drunk were undoubtedly Kuang Cao (wild cursive). There was a four-panel screen, and the postures of the cursive script were all different. The characters were connected to each other, like dragons and snakes with flying white, seemingly soft and boneless but with hidden toughness. What style was this? He said it was "Tangled Vine Cursive." The strokes were discontinuous, like the clarity of bamboo, like the uprightness of stems. What school was this? He said it was "Broken Branch Cursive." Those that moved freely and reached all directions were called "Divination Cursive." Those that were like flying flowers and dancing leaves, beautiful and charming, were called "Sweeping Orchid Cursive." It was like this kind of laborious cursive script, so how could the cursive script be disrespectful!</p>
<p>In summary, the cursive script he created was particularly unrestrained and strange. The intentional parts were like singing and slow dancing, and the unrestrained parts were like flashing lightning and galloping wind. There were chaotic stones paved on the street, and even the dots and strokes were in a mess. Some characters seemed to want to leave the line and desert the team, and some characters even seemed to rush off the paper and fly away. There was also a character that occupied the entire line, going straight to the end to show its charm. Or there was a certain character that was repeated, but each was different in style to show his broad abilities. It was not just showing talent in cursive script, but directly using cursive script as a game! A few paintings by Zhang, with inscriptions, were interspersed on the walls. His inscription on a landscape painting said: "Real mountains and real waters are indeed good, painting water and painting mountains are even more beautiful. The pavilions and bridges are near, and the clouds and trees are far, every slope and every grass are all suitable." His inscription on a figure painting said: "This is a poet's painting, painting the meaning of painting into poetry. The reality seems to be coming out, silently entrusting longing." All of these were worth seeing.</p>
<h3>Full of Spring</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>"Meeting friends through literature, and assisting benevolence with friends," then knowing that "the friendship of gentlemen is as light as water" is possible.</p>
<p>An ancient poem: "Ancient people made friends with gold, if there is not much gold, the friendship is not deep, even if promises are temporarily given? They are always just the hearts of passers-by!" Quoting the past to prove the present can be said to be "a snapshot of the present!"</p>
<p>But after I attended the "Literary Tea Party," I felt: "The wind generates in the four seats, full of spring!" Literary friends who wield pens are all polite, elegant, and pleasant! Talking and laughing, leisurely sipping tea, without the slightest hypocrisy! Nor the slightest vulgarity! Even when choosing a seat, one must choose "taking quietness in the midst of noise!" Avoiding the hustle and bustle! This also shows the aloofness and purity of literary friends!</p>
<p>"Neighbors from the ends of the earth come together, and a branch of spring blooms first on the ridge." Spring in winter! On everyone's enthusiastic faces, in everyone's enthusiastic sleeves, shaking hands warmly with each other, discussing new knowledge and promoting art, men and women, young and old, all showing an enthusiasm filled with joy! To open up the flowers of literature and art! To cultivate warm friendship! This is my life's fortune! It is also the most enjoyable thing in my life! May the literary tea party, "Full of Spring," last forever!</p>
<h3>Angel (Part of the Epiphany)</h3>
<p>— Li Bi</p>
<p>Li Bi (Filippo Lippi 1406-1469) was a painting monk in the temple at that time. His style has both the lyrical poetry of F. Angelico and the calm realism of Masaccio. He paid special attention to the treatment of light and shade and the arrangement of forms. This work was made between the ages of twenty-seven and thirty. The original painting is now in the Badi Temple in Florence, Italy, and is listed by art historians as a representative work of the late fifteenth century. (Lion)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 155</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The swordsmen from outside were retreating in the direction of Tsurumi's arena, so the woman fighting Tsurumi, and Pingzi, also retreated with the main group. The swordsmen from Beppu, pretending to respond, followed the group of outsiders, seemingly pursuing while making noise, but not daring to get close, as if escorting them. They waited until the swordsmen retreated to the wall, some taking turns to climb over it, some covering the rear, then a part guarded on the wall, and a part climbed over the wall. Finally, those guarding on the wall also quickly left, and the people here each sighed with relief, as if a great burden had been lifted, sheathed their swords, and considered it a concluded chapter.</p>
<p>While putting on a show of pursuing the foreign swordsmen, Tsurumi had already somewhat understood after hearing Pingzi's words. However, wanting to see the matter through, he followed behind the pursuing group, also making noise. It seemed he didn't want those outsiders to retreat leisurely. Later, seeing that the people had all climbed over the wall and left, he asked the people around him, "What is on the other side of the wall?" "Why don't we chase after them?" The person shook his head and said, "That is a temple, with great Buddhist power. We cannot go there; the leaders do not allow us to go there."</p>
<p>Japan, this nation, is an inexplicable thing, full of contradictions. On one hand, some people study the latest world science, while on the other hand, they are deeply superstitious. On one hand, they are improving extremely rapidly, almost standing on the front line of the world's material civilization, while on the other hand, they are extremely conservative and stubborn. Therefore, even today, in some places, if samurai engage in械鬥, one can still see the ancient style of sword fights in forests and wild temples from hundreds of years ago. In such arenas of激鬥, if you use modern pistols, electric knives, and other equipment, you won't just be ridiculed by the enemy for being barbaric, but even your own side will feel ashamed and indignant because of you, and even commit suicide.</p>
<p>"Well done, Tsurumi-kun!" someone said in Tsurumi's ear, "Prime Minister is waiting for you in the hall."</p>
<p>Upon hearing the voice, Tsurumi immediately bowed and replied, "Understood;" thinking in his heart, "This is simply a play, a boring martial drama, let's go listen to what this fellow has to say."</p>
<p>"Tsurumi-kun, are you the most clear or the most unclear person about today's events?" Konoe, like in an old drama, maintaining that stylized posture, sat properly cross-legged on the low-legged bed. Tsurumi had already been granted a seat this time, the seat still being that brocade cushion. Although the electric lights had been restored, they were still not used in the hall, instead, many original Japanese-style square and round hanging lanterns were lit, making everything in the hall appear more ancient. Besides the original few serving girls, four more sword-carrying female warriors had been added, squatting in a row close to the foot of the large screen.</p>
<p>"... I only dare say that they did not come to duel with this humble servant alone..." Tsurumi vaguely replied.</p>
<p>"Very true," Konoe seemed to know what Tsurumi was about to say, "This is the third or fourth time they have caused trouble. They believe that 'Eight Corners Under One Roof' is limited to the current mainland. They are very satisfied with the status quo, even the situation before the Restoration. They say the High Pavilion is a big elephant, and Manchuria is a big bomb. They do not know the current world situation, and do not know the intensity of current competition. Because their leader once served as a minister, I did not use modern 'pistols and bombs'!"...</p>

<h3>The Difficulty of the Yin Pass: A Bank Manager's Confession</h3>
<p>— Yide</p>
<p>A bank manager, generally speaking, is such an enviable figure. Not to mention anything else, just look at movies, where bankers are often portrayed as idols of money worship. Women pursue him, obey him, and people in society compliment and flatter him. A bank manager seems to be a representative figure of the God of Wealth, capable of making money and using money. I remember during the War of Resistance in the temporary capital, bank managers were the objects of infatuation for women. What simple officials, they didn't care about them at all, but the "bank manager" first conquered them in their minds. Cao Yu's "Sunrise," isn't it also centered around a bank manager? But let me tell you my troubles:</p>
<p>The Pressure of Headway</p>
<p>First, the pressure of balancing accounts is苦. In the past, banking had seasonality, and the tightness of headway had a fixed period, such as the tea season, silk season, cotton season... As long as you prepared in advance, you could cope with it easily when the time came. But doing banking today is like going through the New Year every day, with headway often impossible to grasp. Suddenly, it becomes so loose that you can't lend it out, "rotting" painfully, and then suddenly it becomes so tight that you have to scramble desperately, often working until late at night and still unable to "stop," so anxious that you almost want to "hang yourself." You must still remember the stories of Chen Da Silver Firm and Jian Guo Bank. The manager of Chen Da ran around digging for funds for a week, but in the end, he ended up hanging himself. You can imagine what days I went through during that week, my nerves so tense that I was about to faint, my heart pounding as if it would burst, bowing and scraping to people, looking at their faces, the mental pain and suffering that ordinary people cannot imagine, but only bank managers cannot avoid experiencing. This situation is most obvious in small banks, but now even the managers of major banks cannot avoid suffering this苦.</p>
<p>The Pressure of Interest Rates</p>
<p>Second, doing business is苦. The interest rate for deposits stipulated by the bank is 1.8% per month, and the interest rate for loans is 1.35% per month. No one outside the industry doesn't say that banks make good money. This is truly like watching a fire from across the river, unaware of the misery of the people inside. Currently, the black market interest rate, the so-called usury, is as high as 1.8% to 2.5% per month, and underground money houses are also very active. What fool would send money to the bank to leave it idle? The detachment of floating funds from banks has a long history, and it is even more so today. Term deposits are even less to be said, and even demand deposits are extremely rare. Now, the meager funds that banks rely on are mostly the demand deposit balances of scattered retail customers. This is thanks to the inconvenience of cash turnover. Generally, merchants must open an account to use checks. Thus, today they deposit five million, and tomorrow or even "use it on the same day" for four million nine hundred thousand, but there is still a balance of one hundred thousand in the account. The bank relies on thousands or even tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands to form a lump sum for turnover and use. Its internal emptiness and the difficulty of operation are like a candle in the wind, a tower on the sand, truly unable to withstand wind and waves and blows.</p>
<p>Furthermore, out of this meager total amount, the central bank must take 20% as a "deposit reserve," and the bank itself must set aside 30% as a "cash reserve." In this way, 50% is set aside, and only 50% can be used. Using this 50% of funds to operate lending, exchange, and other businesses, we also have to deduct the bad debts, defaults, and other possible risks. To make money to pay for huge expenses and taxes, how can it be easy!</p>
<p>The most headache is "same-day use." To avoid eating up the call money interest, we demand that the check be deposited on the same day when opening an account. Before the exchange is revealed, we must first allow the use of the funds, otherwise, we will not open a deposit account. This method is limitlessly risky. Our own headway has been used up by others, and once the check they deposited bounces, how can this money be recovered? Recently, a certain major bank had such a thing happen. The money was used up by others, and the person also disappeared. You can imagine how difficult it is to do banking.</p>
<p>Third, dealing with people is苦. If a bank manager doesn't accommodate, people will scold you for being rigid, saying you have a "south-facing face," and simply stop doing business with you. If you are too sentimental, you will still be the one who suffers. If the customer doesn't understand the procedures, they will always hate you for being verbose. Once the money is out of your hands, and a problem arises, your difficulties immediately come. The difficulty of collecting debts is known to everyone. Especially in this year, usury is a public fact, but the court still doesn't protect you. You can't be too forceful, but you can't be too soft either. You can imagine how difficult this negotiation is. Dealing with people is the most painful thing there is. When your own headway is "short," that is your unlucky moment. You make phone calls one after another, begging and thanking a thousand or ten thousand times. But if you want wind, the wind doesn't come, and if you want rain, the rain doesn't come. If you haven't dealt with people properly in the past, and your relationship isn't close, who will care about your difficulties, who will save your life? How can outsiders understand the subtleties and complexities of this?</p>
<p>Therefore, please don't compliment bank managers anymore. If "Wu Zixu Crossing the Pass" is the most painful play, then I am singing the play of crossing the pass every day. Look, my hair has turned white with worry.</p>
<p>In this era, I really don't know who is living a happy life!</p>

<h3>In the Barber Shop: Leisurely People, Worldly Attitudes, Human Flavors</h3>
<p>Yesterday I went to the barber shop for a haircut and saw that every barber was more attentive than usual. Why? I wondered. After the haircut, when they put my coat on, they had a smiling face, always facing me. That kind of politeness made me feel flattered. When I took out half of a stack of ten thousand yuan bills to give him, he bowed slightly, again with a smiling face, and said: "Sir, the haircut fee is doubled from the Small New Year's Eve? It's always like this every year, nine thousand yuan is enough." Oh! Nine thousand yuan, my heart trembled, and I had to slowly count four more bills and handed them to him, just as I was about to leave, he made a face at his companion, and then tugged at my sleeve, and said softly, "Sir, a tip..." Right, I haven't given a tip yet? So I had to give him the only remaining bill in this stack of banknotes. I ran out the door at a rapid pace, almost hitting my head on the door, and was about to go back, a burst of laughter passed through my eardrums and into my heart, they were clearly mocking me, I was extremely annoyed!</p>
<p>I believe that a haircut for ten thousand yuan is too much for nine out of ten people to bear, when I touch my head, an annoying smiling face appears immediately, I am angry again, hair! Hair! Don't be like corrupt officials who only care about climbing up and neglect the people below, this demon cannot be completely killed by ordinary machines, but beware, one day there will be a sharp weapon to cut you off, and without you, you can reduce a great burden.</p>
<h3>Seeking Good Luck</h3>
<p>— Ye Cao</p>
<p>In the past, wealthy families all hired private tutors, and the compensation was very generous. When the lunar New Year came, the private tutor felt very panicked, because they didn't know whether they would be re-hired next year, so at the turn of the year, they especially wanted to seek good luck from many small actions, and hated to hear signals of dismissal.</p>
<p>In a certain place, there was an old gentleman who was a leading figure in this type of person, and he was stubborn and superstitious. On New Year's Eve, the old gentleman was in a good mood, lit candles and went to bed, instructing the servant before going to sleep to put a lot of "cakes" under his pillow. "What is this thing?" the servant asked. "(High) pillow without worry!" The old gentleman had ulterior motives. Then he lay down, and the old gentleman ordered the servant to place a "chicken egg" on his chest; "What is that for?" "(But) relax!" The old gentleman always remembered his job problem, and used auspicious words to comfort himself.</p>
<p>The candle of keeping watch over the New Year burned to the end, and New Year's Day arrived. The old gentleman woke up groggily, ah! The egg on his chest was gone. He hurriedly called the servant.</p>
<p>"Sir! It's gone!" The servant pointed to a messy pool on the floor, it turned out that the chicken egg had fallen to the ground at some point when the old man turned over.</p>
<p>The servant originally blurted it out unintentionally, but the old gentleman thought it was very unlucky, and was extremely frustrated, lacking energy.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the master saw that the private tutor was dazed and answered irrelevantly, and dismissed him before the fifth day of the New Year.</p>
<h3>Occasional Notes</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>At the end of this year and the beginning of the new year, most bosses feel a shortage of funds and poor turnover; however, the pockets of workers in general factories, and the drivers, nannies, and maids of middle and upper class families, are quite well-off.</p>
<p>For example, the salaries of workers in factories are calculated according to the cost of living index. They live frugally on weekdays, and their income and expenditure situation is much better than that of civil servants. At the end of this lunar year, they also received "double pay" or "year-end bonus," so of course they are having a better time.</p>
<p>As for "servants," the masters are busy with social engagements and sending New Year's gifts, there is a "commission" of up to 20%, so the wider the circle of acquaintances, the more considerable the income. During the New Year, relatives and friends of the master come to pay New Year's greetings, and give "lotus seed soup" and "yuanbao tea." The income of servants in middle-class families is also very considerable, not to mention wealthy families. Although this huge income requires hard work for a whole "year," they don't worry about food and clothing at ordinary times, and there are very few additional expenses, so the end of the year and the beginning of the new year is the most auspicious time for them to "make money!"</p>
<p>The income of the general "workers" and "servants" at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year is "extra" money. Before the war, they took it to the countryside to buy land, but it is not the case after the war. Farming is not profitable, so some "lend it out for interest." However, in recent years, prices have soared and the currency has depreciated, so they have shifted their focus again. Some hoard daily necessities, while most are vying to exchange for "gold jewelry" in silver shops, to preserve their year's "hard work" and prevent private property from being "lost" due to currency devaluation!</p>
<p>Therefore: The business of large and small silver shops in Shanghai is booming, especially during the half month of the "New Year." The bosses and employees are extremely busy, welcoming these customers with "New Year's joy." Don't think that they are small customers, in terms of the "profit" and "weight" of transactions. Little by little, it really is a "good business"! Therefore, when the accounts are closed at the end of the lunar New Year, the "bonuses" received by the employees of several large silver shops are calculated in "strips" (gold bars). In today's world, only silver shops can be considered "heaven's darlings." This is a huge opportunity given by "currency devaluation!"</p>
<p>In this New Year, drivers, nannies... and silver shop employees are all delighted, while other industries are mostly worried, complaining, and lamenting poverty!</p>
<h3>Collective Debt Collection</h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>The end of the year is approaching, people owe each other debts, and as usual, they have to be cleared. Therefore, more than a thousand Chinese employees of the former 工部局 held two collective debt collections in this urgent and dying year.</p>
<p>This old debt (savings, retirement pay, pension money) has as many as thousands of creditors, and the time is separated by the eight years of the War of Resistance, and it is also entangled with some international relations, so that after more than a year of debt collection, the debtors on the opposite side have not been found, which has made these thousands of creditors anxious and waiting to die. Some have thrown themselves into the river, and some have hanged themselves.</p>
<p>Fortunately, during the second collective debt collection a few days ago, the mayor personally came forward and explained in public that the property rights and debts of the former concession had been transferred to the municipal government, and personally admitted that the municipal government was the debtor "with a grievance, there is a head, and with a debt, there is a master." After finding the debtor, it was finally a reassurance for thousands of creditors!</p>
<p>In the end, more than a thousand creditors in the collective debt collection publicly elected the mayor as the general representative for debt collection. The mayor is a mayor, and his position was originally the representative of the debtors. In this way, he became the representative of the creditors. This mayor, who holds both parties' representative positions, has to represent the municipal government to pay off this old debt on the one hand, and represent the Chinese employees to recover this old debt on the other hand, and seems to be doing another "sandwich"!</p>
<p>The representative of the debtors of this old debt is the mayor, and the representative of the creditors is also the mayor. In the future, when repaying the debt, the procedures can be greatly simplified. Let's wait!</p>
<h3>Philosophical Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Candle</p>
<p>It also melts its whole body's energy to give off light and heat. But when its energy is too abundant, and the light and heat it emits is always so little, it will quietly shed tears.</p>
<p>Cigarette Butt</p>
<p>It is most intimate with you, but you often abandon it so cruelly, sometimes even stepping on it, crushing it to pieces, losing the residual heat of life.</p>
<p>Firecracker</p>
<p>The fate of a lifetime is only to rise up for a moment, to make a sound, after which it no longer exists.</p>
<p>Fountain Pen</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily have to be full to be driven by you and work well. If it is completely empty, then it will give you a blank look and there will be no follow-up.</p>
<p>Drum</p>
<p>There is nothing inside the belly, but the sound is deafening when it speaks. A detestable thing!</p>
<p>Glasses</p>
<p>The most absurd thing we do is this, because our eyes can't see external things clearly, but we still want to put something on our eyes to cover them.</p>
<h3>The Central Figure in the Northeast Situation: Some Anecdotes about Xiong Shihui</h3>
<p>— Dunfu</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, the director of the Northeast 行辕, left Shenyang for Peiping on the 9th of this month, and went to Beijing on the 11th to report on the military and political situation in the Northeast to the Chairman, and to ask the Central Government for instructions on the handling of Northeast diplomacy, especially the Dalian issue. These two days, Xiong has been in frequent contact in the capital and is very busy. On the one hand, people in the Northeast are expecting Xiong to bring new improvements to the local area after his return.</p>
<p>Speaking of Xiong Shihui, everyone knows that he used to be the Chairman of Jiangxi Province, and was famous for his "hard work," "practical work," and "quick work." At that time, the 共軍 in Jiangxi was entrenched, the official history was corrupt, and the provincial administration was hesitating at a crossroads. Since Xiong took office, Jiangxi's politics began to get on track. It is said that at that time, this Chairman Xiong often wore a blue cloth gown and went to the countryside to secretly investigate, and if he found any long-standing malpractices, he would decisively deal with them. A certain Ji Wei director in Yushan County embezzled donations, and Xiong executed him immediately after discovering it.</p>
<p>Xiong himself is from Jiangxi, and he has his own unique way of governing Jiangxi. He was originally a soldier and had attended military school in Japan. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was ordered to be transferred to the Northeast 行辕, which shows the importance attached to him by the Central Government.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever come into contact with Xiong, or who has read Xiong's articles, must know that although Xiong is brave and good at fighting, he is actually a scholar. He loves books and paintings, and reads and paints in his spare time, pursuing his elegant life. I remember once when Xiong returned from a visit to Longhua in Shanghai to see the peach blossoms, he wrote a seven-character quatrain:</p>
<p>He always carries the Peiwun Rhyme Dictionary with him, and spends his free time studying it. Every morning, Xiong practices swordsmanship for half an hour, making him a Confucian general and admirable.</p>
<p>"Peach blossoms are like burning water and like oil, tourists fight in the valley, the most beautiful is the March road of Longhua, fragrant dust first floods the temple bell tower."</p>
<p>In Xiong's life, there are two dangerous things worth noting: one was when he led his troops to pursue Sun Chuanfang in Yishui during the Northern Expedition, and went deep into enemy territory, almost reaching a desperate situation; the other was when Xiong's plane crashed to the ground, but Xiong was lucky enough not to share the same fate as the passengers of the recently crashed China Aviation aircraft, extremely dangerous!</p>
<p>A soldier like Xiong, who is familiar with politics and diplomacy and also proficient in poetry and painting, is really rare in China.</p>
