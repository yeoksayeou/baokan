<h3>經濟緊急措施方案今提國防委會討論　俞財長談最近金潮因素</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕主席于十五日下午八時，在官邸召宴政府要員，于右任，宋子文，兪鴻鈞，王雲五等，均應邀前往。席間曾對當前經濟，政治各重要問題，談詢甚久，十時許始散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕十六日上午九時舉行之國防最高委員會，其主要討諭議題，爲王寵惠氏所起草之選舉法，及針對當前經濟之緊急揹置辦法。選舉法如經國防會通渦後，尙須送交立法院，完成立法程序。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕政府草擬之經濟緊急措施，經中央黨部經濟政策研究委會十五日上下午兩次討論，已全部擬定。當晚由宋院長呈蔣主席核示，可望於十六日下午四時國防委會臨時會中提出。至根本辦法則將從長計議，再予實施。經濟政策委會第一次會，十五日上午十時於中央黨部召開，出席宋子文，戴傳賢，徐堪，陳立夫，蕭錚，兪鴻鈞，劉健羣，賀衷寒，黃元彬，樓桐孫，李俊龍等。陳立夫主席，對金鈔及物價問題，曾作全盤檢討。多數僉認物價問題應作根本解決，不應專限於公敎人負或一二地點。首决會至一時許始散，下午四時繼續開會，仍由陳立夫主持，經二小時會議後，對經濟緊急措施，已有最後決定。</p>
<p>（本報南京十五日電〕政府將停止生產貸款，以防投機份子從中操縱。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕兪鴻鈞十五日晨出席立法院臨時會議，報吿此次金潮起因及政府爲應付此事所將採取之措施，據謂政府各部會日來正忙於草擬穩定金融，安定民生之整個方案，俾從積極消極方面管制物價，取締投機，以消除擾亂金融之各種因素。此一方案可望於十六日國防最高委會臨時會中提出公布。渠信，實施後市塲必可趨於穩定。兪氏謂，黃金政策應因時因地制宜，目前此一政策確有重加檢討必要。政府之實行黃金政策，其目的在吸收游資，以使法幣回寵，並以平定物價，金價與物價雖無關係，然對人心多少可有影響。過去一二年中國利用此種政策而吸收之游資，爲數殊不在少，惟至去年年底，由於下述二種原因，掀起金潮：</p>
<p>（一）上海若十工商發放福利金，每人各得二三百萬，游資驟增，爭購黃金，</p>
<p>（二）風傳央行存金空虛，而其根本原因則爲游資作祟。此爲整個經濟問題，在金融上之表現，欲謀解決，當不能專自金融着眼。整套方案正由財，糧，社，經等部草擬中，明日可提出。兪氏鄭重指出：央行現仍握有大量金鈔，足以應付市場需要；惟整個黃金政策，正在檢討中；因之，將來是否繼續大量拋售，仍待研討。司徒德請其宣布存金數目，並詢政府對作祟之游資。有否統計？兪謂，央行存金儘足應付市塲需要。至游資數額，則因其時時游動，無可稽考。惟政府對如何加以限制，使其不能自遠地集中上海，將採有效步驟。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕經决潘序倫十五日晨於立院說明當前經濟措施時，指出經濟情况若再因金潮而繼續惡化時，政府將被迫攷慮採取若干管制步驟，以使物價平定。戰時政府會於後方實施管制，對各地物價的束，實大有功。上海近事亦足證明管制對物價有良好影響，經部現正攷慮如何利用現尙有效之管制法令以防囤積居奇現象。潘氏認爲在此經濟非常時期，若再容忍過份，自由作風將使局勢更見惡化；惟我國幅員廣大，物資種類又多，管制工作若僅枝節着手，必難生效。</p>
<h3>台幣法幣比率　改为一對六十</h3>
<p>〔本報台北十四日電〕當局決於日內宣布：台幣與法幣新比率，爲一對六十元。熊式輝對記者稱</p>
<h3>接收大連哈市　正待政府命令</h3>
<p>態式輝對記者稱</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十四日電〕東北行贛熊主任式輝，十四日於行轅會議室接見記者廿餘人。對所詢各問題皆逐加答覆，關於接收大連哈爾濱中央交涉情形，熊氏答稱：大連哈爾濱兩市，並無何外交問題，不用再辦交涉；惟等待政府命令，可往接收。</p>
<p>問：共軍目前在東北到處竄擾，是否將有大規模蠶動？</p>
<p>答：就國軍實力來講，共軍在東北不能有何行動；惟最高當局對接收問題，希望儘量用政治方式解決。</p>
<p>問：主任對東北大豆輸出問題，如何主張？</p>
<p>答：大豆應大量出口，但因關內物價彼動，大豆發生巨大差價。本人希望由此種差價，獲得利潤，但不要刺激其他物價。記者繼問以行轅副主任人選，中央是否確定？熊氏稱，迄今中央尙未發表。最後記者就東北九省區界變更一說，加以詢問，熊氏稱，爲期尙早，擬俊九省全部接收後，將小部分犬牙交錯地方，予以調整。</p>
<h3>共軍渡松花江　其塔木再失陷</h3>
<p>〔本報長春十五日電〕松北共軍攻勢又起，松花江西岸之其塔木，昨又爲渡江共軍攻陷，以馬曳之扒犂廿餘具，大肆搶糧，並將當地警察所通信設備破壞。</p>
<p>〔本報長春十五日電〕九台東九十里之吳宣峒西莊，十三日有着雜色服裝之共軍侵入。</p>
<p>〔本報長春十五日電〕樺甸外圍盤踞共軍三萬餘人，有攻縣城企圖。</p>
<h3>配售日用品辦法　首先配予公役及其家屬　學生軍警等決另案辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕經濟部，糧食部等機關負責人，十五日下午三時續在經部開會，商討公敎人員日用品配售辦法。草案略加修改後，已全案通過。可能於十六日國防委會中提出。今日會議係由潘序倫主席，會中對公役日用品配售辦法中，亦曾加以討論。聞决定每一公役及其家屬，每月可得米五斗，煤一担，糖二斤，每半年藍布五丈，鹽四斤，油三斤；若能於國防會通過，亦將於三月一日起實施。其價格則以去年十二月底爲標準。又此次配售，暫以公敎人員爲限，學生軍警將另案辦理。生產運輸事業員工配售辦法，亦將予以研討。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾招待記者　檢討我經濟情況　謂幣値對農要影響較小</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕美國國務卿馬歇爾，在招待記者會中，曾就中國之經濟問題發表談話，內容如次：</p>
<p>「中國之幣制問題，早即陷於悲慘狀態中，目前益見嚴重。當本人初蒞華時，匯兌率爲一，六〇〇元法幣對美鈔一元。當時情形即已極爲嚴重，而目前尤甚。</p>
<p>在檢討中國幣制情形時，有一點値得考慮：中國大部份民衆均爲農民，其直接受幣制影響之程度，不若美國人民之甚。在上海。南京各地，情形極爲嚴重；但在農村方面，農民耕耘而食，其與經濟困難之關係，似不甚密切」。</p>
<p>記者詢諸馬歇爾，若中國禁止美鈔流通，則其對美國之進出口貿易，將有何種影響？馬歇爾認爲：各方面對此意見不一致，故殊難遽下斷論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕國務卿馬歇爾，今日招待記者時宣稱：國務院經濟顧問皆勸其不必干預此事。惟美政府是否應援助中國，如再援助則其性質如何，均未有所決定。至於何時可以實行援助，亦無表示。馬氏甫與參院外交委員會作目次會議。據稱：曾談及世界大部份之紛擾地點，並向委員會報吿，世界情形殊屬可危。外交委員會主席范登堡則稱、馬氏報告頗多，令人興奮之處。馬氏與委員會談話，的達小時半，但其詳情不願宣布。</p>
<p>美進出口銀行　否認貸款謠傳</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕美國進出口銀行今日否認上海方面華人所傳「美國政府將願以五億元放款早日貸與中國」之說。該銀行發言人稱：「就余所知，上海方面該一報告實毫無根據」。按美國進出口銀行，於一九四六年四月，曾劃出五億元，作爲他日可能的對華貸款，以助中國之復興計劃。該行乃美國政府所能命令貸款中國之唯一機構。據美政肘官員稱，國際復興銀行，在理論上雖亦可向華放款，但實際上殊不後能。</p>
<h3>徐向前之甥　張俊德投誠</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原十五日電〕中共冀南支隊衛生處文化敎育幹事張俊德，，係徐向前之甥，因洞悉共黨禍國陰謀，不甘同汚，毅然向政府自首投誠，並致函其舅，痛陳利害。</p>
<h3>方先覺被俘不確</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕記者頃以日前報載方先覺被俘一事，詢國防部有關方面，據稱：此乃謠傳，絕無其事。</p>
<h3>參政會駐委會　審查財經提案　商定原則明日再討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕參政會駐委會十五日晨九時舉行財政，經濟提案審查委會，出席傅斯年，錢公來，尹述賢，羅衡等十餘人，莫德惠主席，宣布該會接到有關財政經濟提案共九件，其中八件屬於黃金政策與穩定物價，一件屬於外匯，午前討論未畢，午後續開會，至三時許始畢，據聞商得結論整理後，將於十七日舉行之駐委會提出討論。茲錄兩重要提案及結論要點如次：（一）尹述賢等提請政府迅派公正人士，澈查黃金外匯之售價情形，以制止物價之高漲案，辦法如次：甲，請政府迅派社會公正人士或委託本會派員澈查黃金。外匯售買數字及澈查央行總裁貝祖貽有無舞弊情事。乙，凡屬囤積居奇及不正當之多購黃金。外匯商人，應以擾亂金融罪處以極刑，並沒收其財產。丙、請政府從新檢討黃金政策，在未訂　管制辦法以前，黃金外匯賣買一律停止。（二）達浦生等提抑平物價案，辦法如次：甲，禁止黃金買賣。乙，實行計劃經濟。內，實行征收財產稅，以增國庫收人。丁，請政府派員調查官僚資本營業究有若干，同時調查操縱金融，使黃金美鈔作祟者究係何人在各報公在。戊，金潮使物價突增七八倍以上，民間疾苦實况應呈報蔣主席。討論結果所得結論要點如次：（一）請政府切實規定黃金美鈔不得爲買賣媒介。（二）立即暫停黃金買賣。（三）如有以黃金外幣在國內定貨購房屋者，均處以擾亂金融罪。（四）外匯不得在市塲交易。（五）請政府交立院監院參政會三單位共同組織調查國，淸查外匯實情。（六）如查結果屬實，應嚴予懲處。</p>
<h3>立委正式建議政府　黃金國有外幣管制　立院下周會議邀宋院長列席</h3>
<p>黃金政策頗多質詢</p>
<p>本報南京十五日電〕立院十五日晨舉行臨時會，檢討黃金政策，孫院長主持，到立委七十餘人，兪鴻鈞潘序倫咸列席。諮詢會印各立委對政府所採黃金政策，咸猛加抨擊，僉認此一政策不唯不能使物價平抑，反引導百物上揚，應即停止。周一志指出黃金儲券扣成辦法不當，認此勢將使人民對政府失去信心，不智殊甚。至外匯調整事，兩月前早應實現，一再稽延，致僑匯紛紛逃港。最近實行之進出口貼補政策，實際受患者，亦非眞正生產者。陳顧遠抨擊政府僅帮助不正當之資本家牟利，助長官僚資本。政府歷次調整外匯，皆有內在原因。去歲中秋，因若干不正當商人難以獲節，乃調整外匯，使其渡過節關。結果金價自十八萬漲至廿八萬。在此緊急關頭，政府應採緊急措施，對政策作澈底的改變，俾爲國家留若千元氣。衛挺生謂，所謂黃金政策，根本不能成爲一種政策，其初意在平抑物價，而結果反引導物價上漲。本身即自相矛盾，實爲中外所未有。渠認爲政府捨正途而勿由，不從發公債着手，僅着眼發鈔票，致日絕生路。</p>
<p>匯率太低出口停滯</p>
<p>同時匯價又如此之低，致物品無法出口，而外貨又源源而來，工商不能存在，農村隨之凋敝，游資羣趨市塲。致掀起如此大波。司徒德認爲政府對游資總數若無統計，則繼續黃金政策，必難收效。據渠估計，上海專爲作黃金買賣而集中之游資，總數達九千萬萬。孫九錄指出，此次外匯貼補政策實施後，美鈔等於漲價百分七十五，金鈔隨之上漲，結果引起此次金潮。鍾天心等，對經部種種措施，亦表不滿，認爲經部僅注重提高物價而未採管制。政府高唱扶植民營工廠，而民營工廠無法生存，實爲親者所痛。陳長蘅等認爲政府爲應付此次金潮，聞將擬一緊急措施，此一辦法最好能先送立院審查。劉不同等所提黃金美鈔收歸國有案，今日會中曾予討論，決議送財政經濟委會審查。九人委會辭職已照准。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕立法院第三一四次會議，今上午九時至十二時，繼續舉行；檢討政府財政經濟政策，由孫院長主席，兪鴻鈞，潘序倫，應邀列席。兪氏答復質詢多起，於十時四十分退席。繼由潘决長對經濟情形作概括報吿。又答詢中紡公司盈餘及燃料管理委會近况歷一小時。最後孫院長宣佈定下星期四或星期五舉行一臨時會議，邀請宋院長列席，報吿財政經發設施。先是兪部長曾轉達立法院，宋氏決於兩週內親來立院就敎。各立委正搜集材料，準備實詢問題</p>
<p>兩大提案所具理由</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕立法委員劉不同，李慶塵，程元斟，簡貫三，陳海澄，陳紫楓，戴修駿，黃芸蘇等，臨時動議，提出下列兩案，當經議決，交財政經濟兩委會審查，原提案如下：</p>
<p>（一）由本院建議國防最高委會，飭政院下令封閉黃金市塲，停止黃金買賣，將黃金一律收歸國有案。其理由爲：—自實行法幣政策後，黃金與法幣根本脫離關係，政府利用黃全政策，收縮法幣數額，須在通貨停止膨脹之條件下，方能有效。現通貨膨脹旣不能停止，黃金政策已失效用。目下如仍繼續此種政策，從損失國家有用之黃金，供富有階級投機發財。2現下黃金與法幣雖無聯帶關係，但黃金價格高漲，仍能刺激物價，然黃金價格下落而不能使物價下落，此爲數月來之事實。邇來游資作祟，爭購黃金使金價飛騰而物價亦隨之上漲。如根本無黃金之交易，另用其他方法納游資於正軌，即無此種現象。黃金市塲封閉後，政府即宣佈黃金國有政策，禁止黃金出口，有黃金者可自動將黃金交於國家，國家予之以相當代價或以相當價格之公債票。</p>
<p>（二）由本院建議，國防最高委會，飭政院宣布外幣一律收歸國有，並施行計劃的對外貿易政策，其理由爲：</p>
<p>1外幣之買賣流弊與黃金政策相同，故應行停止，將外幣一律按相當價格收歸國有以後，外僑持有外幣，應到我央行兌換法幣，以遏止國內外幣買賣之投機而免刺激物價。</p>
<p>2我國現行管制外匯辦法，出口商所得之外匯，須按法價結售於央行，進口商須向中央銀行申請，但以法定價格太低，以致出口商損失太大，因而影響出口貿易。故現下政府又有對於出口商貼補百分之百的政策。但此辦法效果如何，姑不置論，然其影響使財富愈形集中分配愈形不均實非國家社會之　。</p>
<p>3進口商人以國內物價高漲進口貨物利益甚大雖有申請手續之限制，但爲牟利起見仍可走私或與串請機關勾結作弊，無法限止，故爲免除弊端計，進口貿易亦應採取計劃制度。</p>
<h3>國軍昨進駐臨沂　殘餘共軍已分三路潰逃　魯西方面同時收復定陶</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕國軍經四小時激戰後，已於十五日上午七時進駐魯南重鎭臨沂，共軍殘部向該城西北蒙陰，泗水潰逃。入城國軍一面安撫人民，一面　淸城中殘餘共軍，並派有力部隊跟踪追擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州十五日電〕共軍劉伯誠殘部續越定陶向鄆城方面敗退，國軍十五日下午收復定陶，並乘勝尾追，期在黃河南岸將其澈底解決。聞劉三日前率後方人員萬餘逃往黃河北岸之壽張。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十四日電〕防守臨沂正面之共軍解四。解九等師之主力，十四日已開始向臨沂東南山區撤退，贛楡境內現已無大股共軍竄擾。又由新寨南下之國軍，十四日已進蒙陰近郊</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十四日電〕魯中方面，進至新泰南鰲陽鎭附近國軍，因共軍大量增援，並以一部的五千由蒙陰北竄，企圖襲擊國軍側背，故該區戰事今仍在原地區進行中，濟南外圍則平靜如故。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南十五日電〕王耀武一手培植五虎將之二的李天霞，張靈甫兩師所部勁旅，於十五日上午十時已正式收復臨沂城。按臨沂爲中共第二支强大部隊新四軍之根據地，亦爲中共華東局僞山東省政府與山東軍區之所在地，亦即大江以北大河以南中共之軍事政治中心，其對中共之重要性，僅决於廷安，而超渦東北之佳木斯，亦即無異華東之延安。共軍在臨沂之敗，其意義之實大，影響之嚴重，不僅遠過於前此之失敗於蘇北及張家口，且遠過於去歲暮春之失敗於四平街及長春。臨沂被共軍盤踞已歷七年，今日重見天日，人民歡欣若狂。陳毅率殘部分三路向沂蒙山區潰逃，一路由蒙陰奔泗水，一路由梁邱投鄒縣，一路中費縣亦趨泗水揆其企圖，或將在魯南山地稍事整休，再越津浦路西竄，與劉伯誠合流。因沂蒙山區北麓已有王　武兵團堅阻，北去宣不可能也。陳毅所率之新四軍，原有六個基幹師，四個新編師，三個解放師，十個縱隊，據官方估計，其損失總數已有十六個旅，七個縱隊，六個團，約當總兵力</p>

<h3>對參加政府四機構　民社黨發表聲明　人員選定共為四十四名</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國民主社會黨為參加改組中之立法院，監察院，黨政實施促進會，參政會等四機構事，昨特發表聲明如下：本黨自參加政協以來所致力者，為求中國之和平與民主，良以不和平不統一，一切政治之設施，財政之整頓，均無從着手，迨後，談判停頓，政府宣佈召開國民大會之日期，第三方面復叙集南京，謀所以調解之道，其時烽烟滿地，捨先停戰外，不足以言和談，然一涉及停戰，則駐軍地點，地方政權等問題，又因之而起，於是因軍事而牽涉政治，政治復牽涉軍事，互相糾纏，無取已時；而中共對於國大之召開，既不同意原定日期，又不商洽另定日期，在此情形之下，政府既有意結束訓政，制定憲法，對於走上民主，自為接近一步，故本黨提名國大，參加制憲工作，以期奠定民主政治之基礎；迨憲法告成，國內烽烟，仍未少息，政府以距離行憲日期，尙有相當時日，其有關行憲問題如選舉法及其他法律之制定等，均非訓政時期之政府所能勝任，非待其他各黨派之參加與合作，不足以鏖全國人士之望，故決定改組政府，堅邀本黨提名參加；本黨處此交替時期，對於可能參加之工作，惟有本合作精神，共圖實現故參加立法院，與憲政實施促進會，自為義之所不容辭，監察院職務，對於過渡時期之政治，亦須有所糾正，參政會為戰時集思廣益之機構，各黨已久列席，所以參加之者，至此為止，期於納政治於民主與法治正軌！本黨幾經討論，認為既參加制憲，則對於行憲之準備工作，非參加不足以云盡查，故一致決議，參加改組中之立法院，監察院憲政實施促進會及參政會四機構，以求無負於漸次進入法治與人民望治之至意；至於担負決策與行政之責任，待之全國各黨一致飭力於和平民主之日（三十六年二月十五日）。」</p>

<p>昨晚八時，此間美記者特聯合於百老匯大樓設宴歡迎，並歡送霍氏等。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中國竟又遭侮辱！</h3>
<p>倫敦四國外次會議於十四日開會，討論中國應否為對德和會召集國一項問題，英，美，法三國代表，一致主張四強與中國均應為對德和會的召集國，惟蘇聯代表葛塞夫不顧英美法三國代表的反對，仍堅持其原來立場，始終不變，並重言聲明其理由稱：『唯有德國降書簽字國，卽英，美，法，蘇四強，始能認為對德和會之召集國』；致使四國外次會議對於此事未能商獲協議。</p>
<p>關於這一個問題，在紐約四國外長會議舉行最後一次會議，決定莫斯科外長會議程序的時候，美國國務卿貝爾納斯曾提出建議，主張邀請中國出席下次外長會議，參加對德和約的起草工作；但遭蘇聯外長莫洛托夫的堅決反對，因此這個建議乃成為國際間的懸案，不寗唯是，而且莫洛托夫外長甚至反對中國為對德和會的召集國之一。他所依據的理由是：波茨坦宣言規定，唯有簽字德國降書的國家，始能參加對德和約的起草工作。</p>
<p>蘇聯方面所持的理由，不論在法理上或再道義上，都是不能成立的。姑就法理而論，波茨坦宣言最重要的規定，乃在規定設立一個五國外長會議，負責商訂對歐洲六個敵國之和約，並提議解決由歐洲戰爭結束而發生之領土問題；而對於和約的起草工作，僅規定由外長會議中曾經簽字於降書的會員國担任而已，就是莫斯科三國外長共同宣言，也規定和約起草完竣之後，卽由外長會議召集二十一國和會，討論此項和約草案，並提出建議。準此而論，和約的起草工作，固應由簽字於降書的國家担任，但是討論和約草案的和會，應由五國外長會議五個會員國共和召集之。所以中國可以不參加對歐洲六個敵國和約的起草工作，但是起草和約的工作，僅是整個議程與程序中的一部份而已；整個議程與程序，自應由外長會議五個會員國加以決定，換言之，蘇聯因有理由拒絕中國參加和約的起草工作，但沒有理由反對中國為和會的召集國之一。</p>
<p>其次在道義上而論，德國是第二次世界大戰的罪魁禍首，應負這次大戰爆發的一切責任。中國雖以地理上的因素，未能直接參加對德戰爭，但在遠東孤軍奮鬥，與德國的盟國日本帝國主義者，作殊死戰，實替在歐洲戰場上作戰的盟國，分担了一部分極重大的負但，盟國的戰勝德國，中國的牽制日本，使其不能為德國的奧援，實有重大的貢獻。尤其使蘇聯，在大戰之中，德國在戰略上日夜所渴望的，就是日本的參加對蘇作戰，以收東西兩面夾擊之效，假定當時日本沒有中國的牽制，毫無顧忌地對蘇聯宣戰了，蘇聯在德日兩大勢力夾攻之下，究將造成何種悲慘的局勢，我們實在不敢想像。而今蘇聯竟忘了過去盟邦的貢獻，居然要反對中國為對德和會的召集國，無異對其昔日的盟邦在國際上的地位，橫加侮辱，在道義上又怎樣說法呢？</p>
<p>基於上述兩項理由，中國政府欲上月底被要列席倫敦外次會議發表意見時，曾以照會分別送違英美法蘇四國政府，重申其一貫的主張，並提出兩項建議：　對德奧和約應由聯合國之有關各國正式舉行一和會討論之：　一切關於召開和會程序問題，應由外長會議全體五個會員國，先行磋商決定。同時並說明理由：「根據波茨坦協定對歐洲敵國和約之起草工作，雖由外長會議中曾經簽字於降書之會員國担任，但和會之召集以及一切有關和會之組織之程序問題，應由外長會議全體五個會員國先行協商決定」。中國政府所提供的理由，可謂理直氣壯，實在無法可依駁斥，外次會議於十四日討論此一問題，英法代表也主張；一俟對德和約起草完竣之後，卽召集對德和會，加以討論，四強與中國應為此項和會的召集國。由此也可以看出，人同此心，心同此理，只要理由正常和充分，就不怕他人的強詞奪理的雄辯。現在蘇聯代表葛塞夫所說明的理由，仍是莫洛托夫在紐約外長會議時所發表的一套厥詞，顯無理由可言，是無庸駁斥的。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫與葛塞夫，均為蘇聯當代第一流外交家，匪特頭腦清楚，眼光犀利，而且對於任何事情均能洞若觀火；難道這一點事理也分辨不清嗎？他們究竟爲什麽要反對中國為和會的召集國之一呢？莫洛托夫爲什麽敢藐視中國至此地步？這些問題都值得我們痛切反省與警惕的！</p>
<p>我國於戰後所採取的外交政策，總算夠開明了。在任何國際會議中，一貫的採取不偏不倚的超然態度，遇到爭論不下的時候，常以排難解紛的調人自居，從中斡旋，一年半以來，對於促進國際合作與諒解，不知盡了多少力量，歷次國際會議的成功，得之於中國代表的力量，也不算少。可以說中國已盡了國際兩大集團間的橋樑的任務了。尤其對於蘇聯，力求其諒解與友好，為謀得蘇聯的友誼，曾作偉大的自我犧牲，中蘇同盟友好的條約的簽訂，更又証明中國對於蘇聯的眞誠！但是蘇聯外長究竟爲什麽要這樣侮辱中國的國際地位一至於此！我們眞覺難解。</p>
<p>我國在國際上遭受蘇聯的侮辱，已不祗這一次，例如去年七月間蘇聯曾拒絕中國為巴黎和會的召集國之一，當時雖也引起中國人民的反感，但爲了偵悉中蘇間的傳統友誼，忍耐又忍耐，始得沖淡：同時又經友邦英美的調解，在巴黎和會中乃得與英、美、法、蘇四國輪流担任主席，所以沒有引起兩國人民在感情上的破裂。但至今日，蘇聯代表故態復猛，無論蘇聯的意向如何，終不免要影響了中國四萬萬五千萬人民歷年來對蘇視睦的情緒。我們為偵悉中蘇間傳統的友誼起見，對於葛塞夫不顧英、美、法三國代表的反對，仍加持其原來主張，不惜侮辱中國的國際地位的論調不得不表示抗議。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社捷克京城十四日電〕關於法捷兩國即將舉行談判，締結同盟條約一事，頃由法國駐捷克大使德祥加以評論稱：，法捷兩國政府本日同時發表聲明，宣佈兩國將舉行談判，締結同盟條約，此舉實足以表示兩國在戰時均曾蒙受痛苦，爲其本身及世界之自由而作戰，而今彼此仍能互相尊重，並已決定在其歷史上消除一九三九年不幸一頁。從而與聯合國共同爲發展和平與世界繁榮而努力云。同時據擁克外長馬薩里克發表聲明稱：法捷兩國政府所發表之聯合公報，乃爲其本人及克萊門蒂斯在巴黎與法國領袖舉行會談之結果，法國爲德國之西隣，捷克則爲德國之東鄰，雙方對德和的之談判，自必極度表示關切，法　聯合公報在政治上上重要性，即存在於此一事實，對德和的必須保證對於德國之管制以及法捷兩國安全云。</p>
<h3>英法同盟　談判開始　英方似感淡漠</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕英法同盟之正式談判，已於今日開始，雙方曾正式交換草的。法方草的甫於今晨經法內閣通過，由法大使馬西格利於本日下午在英外交部遞交英代表哈維爵士。一般相信由於雙方所提草的意見差異甚少之故，談判之際當不致有何困難。法方草約，似欲將同盟關係擴大及於軍事方面，包括基地之共同使用，航空人員及電備之交換等。英國方面似不欲以英法盟約代行聯合國機構之任務。惟英官方若干人士則認目前與法締結軍事同盟，實較聯合國機構更能保障歐洲之和平。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十五日電〕英法兩國今日交換同盟條約草案，但據外交部方面表示，英國對於條約似感淡漠，至少在涉及德國部份為然。爭點或在魯爾間題，法國政治領袖請英方給予保障，英方認爲係要求魯爾煤礦英國欲將魯爾問題延至莫斯科外長會議以後，再行成立協議。巴黎方面，法政府發言人則稱，英法同盟條約，如在下月莫斯科會議以前簽字並不足奇。惟英法兩方迄未發表該約條文。</p>
<h3>「花朶戰爭」　英法海軍會同慶祝</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法國尼斯港十四日電〕英法驅逐艦各兩艘，今日午後護衛英國四萬五千噸主力艦「的克公爵」號駛抵維爾弗朗許灣，各該艦士兵將參加尼斯之狂歡節，尤其是海軍「花朶戰爭」紀念節。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西非法屬加隆勃朗加港十四日電〕英國國內艦隊第二隊，昨日駛抵此間，包括巡洋艦及驅逐艦各二艘。艦隊司令巴克常即拜訪摩洛哥區　國海軍司令巴育。</p>
<h3>東京越人未威</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十五日電〕僑居東京之越南人，獲得該地中國人，印尼及印度人之贊助，今日舉行示威遊行，反對法國人「企圖對越南重建其殖民地之帝國主義者之統治」。</p>

<h3>法國經濟困難　工潮風起雲湧　賴瑪迪總理謂「國事可慮」</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十四日電〕巴黎公務員連同警察今日罷工四小時，以致一切悉吿停頓。賴瑪迪總理向國民議會宣布「國事可慮，甚至法蘭西共和國亦屬可慮」。此間運輸及交通工人，郵務人員，各郃職員及其他公務人員，於下午舉行大規模示威遊行，經過凱旋門附近各街道，隊伍長達一哩，警察亦離開崗位，加入遊行。巴黎三十二家日報之打字及印刷工人則已先行罷工，致各報均未能出版。公務人員繼起罷工，實係一種示威行動，期達到每月加薪七千五百法郎之要求，政府方面則主張凡薪給較高者不能同樣增加。巴黎自動電話已吿停頓，地下火車與公共汽車亦皆不開，郵電交通全停。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十五日電〕大國　　員罷工，有身穿制服之交通警察參加在內，但此間政界及工會人士皆認爲此一風潮有平息之可能。蓋賴瑪迪埃總理向國民大會發表措詞强硬之呼籲後，公務員將不再舉行象徵罷工故也。據聞總理今已拒絕工會方面增加工資之要求，幷已闡明政府之決心將繼續推行勃魯姆內閣所發動之抑低物價政策。同時報業工潮仍在繼續中，等候物價與工資委員會之決議，但印刷工人工會幷不受共黨勢力之控制，故其工潮並無政治性質。</p>
<h3>菲律賓內戰　有解決希望</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺十五日電〕農民軍領袖泰魯克今日致函國會議員福那台，請向國會宣讀，要求立即停止剿伐，一俟憲兵停止進攻，農民軍準備解散。羅哈斯　統即招待報界加以答覆，謂農民問題不能零星解決，綏靖計畫當繼續進行。泰魯克如願來談，可保護其安全。政治觀察家以爲雙方突然有此表示，菲律賓內戰間題頗有解決希望。</p>
<h3>美國政府　貸款匈國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十五日廣播：美國政府宣佈續以一千五百萬美元貸與匈牙利，作爲購買剩餘物資之用，速同上次之借款，已共有三千萬元，其目的在增强匈牙利反共份子之信心與實力。</p>
<h3>總統親開電車羣衆歡聲雷動</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社墨西哥京城十五日電〕墨西哥總統艾里門開電車出遊，爲衆人共見，但並非每日如此，僅有一次，總統因欲明瞭市區電車行駛之情形，曾坐在電車月台上，行駛五百碼，沿途羣衆均報以歡呼之聲。</p>
<h3>美國務卿承認　世界局勢危急　出席參院委會報告外交　定下月初啟程赴莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十四日電〕美參院外委會本日舉行會議，事後據該會主席范登堡宣稱，馬歇爾國務卿曾就中國。南美·巴勒斯坦及歐洲局勢向外交委會發表聲明，該項聲明在若干方面頗足令人興奮。</p>
<p>〔路透州社華盛頓十四日電〕馬歇爾今日在參院外委會之秘密會議中，曾表示世界已處於極危急之局　中。馬歇爾於，後吿記者，除透露前語外，並謂在會議中曾論及世界大部份之糾紛點，巴勒斯坦問題即為其中之一點。此外關於莫斯科外長會之籌備亦曾論及。又據參院外委會主席范登堡稱，國務卿任職不久，確已頗有心得，渠之報吿殊具鼓勵性云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十四日電〕馬歇爾頃在記者招待會宣稱，本人將於三月五日至七日間乘坐飛機前往莫斯科，出席四外長會議，至於余之顧問人選尙未決定。</p>
<p>佔領經費</p>
<p>至於美國在其佔領各國之經費，本人反對予以减少，此等國家之人民倘若均在飢餓綫上掙扎，則美國勢將無法繼續現行之佔領工作，故國務院對於美軍所佔領各國人民之生活情形，均直接表示關切，吾人若將經費减少，殆將影響美國在國際上之地位。世界局勢雖極危急，但本人對於前途仍抱樂觀態度。</p>
<p>朝鮮問題</p>
<p>報載某蘇聯軍官曾致函漢城工人。敦促彼等一致起來反對朝鮮美當局，國務院現正等彼官方證實此項消息。　　對波關係</p>
<p>以言美國召回其駐波蘭大使蘭恩，此非美國與波蘭斷絕外交關係之謂，至於蘭恩大使在與國務院當局磋商之後，是否重返任所，本人在此未便加以說明。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦</p>
<p>關於英外相貝文決定將巴勒斯坦問題提交聯合國機構處理一事，余在此亦未便加以評論，余意有關各方現仍在倫敦進行會談。</p>
<p>希臘政局</p>
<p>以言希臘問題，深望希臘人民在任何黨派擁有軍隊之時期內團結一致，爲國效勞，美政府希望希臘內閣最近擴大基礎，足以象徴希臘爲應付將來，已不咎旣往，深望希臘政府能頒布大赦命令，並採取步驟，革新其行政。</p>
<h3>對德和會邀請國　蘇意拒我國列入　英美法拒絕南國對奧土地要求</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十四日合衆電〕蘇聯仍堅特中國不得列爲擬議中之德國和會邀請國之一。蘇方稱，僅「簽字於德國投降條款」之國家（即四强）始得爲邀請國。法代表今日已打破會議之和諧，蓋其拒絕考慮予德國以陳述對和約意見之機會。。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：美，英，法三國外决，不顧蘇聯外次之反對，拒絕南斯拉夫奧對土地要求。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：澳洲政府今日以備忘錄致達四强外次會議，建議為德國袒成與遠東委員會相似之設計團體，由戰敗德國之各交戰國參加，該項備忘錄反對「迅速」建立德國中央政府，因德國尙未蹬明已可實行民主也。</p>
<h3>華萊士見解　認美蘇關係緩和</h3>
<p>〔國新聞社捷克勃拉蒂斯拉伐城十四電〕此間斯洛伐新聞駐紐約訪員頃來電稱：美前任商務部長華萊士，本日接見本刊訪員發表談話，略謂，美蘇兩國間之現行關係，已不若去年夏間之緊張。余前此上書杜魯門總統，就外交關係陳述所見，對於澄淸當時局勢，不無裨益，而今馬歇爾元帥就任國務鄉之職，益使現行局勢大見緩利。以言明國在德國所採取之政策，美駐在東歐各國之使節，現均有與反動份子合作之傾向，以視德境之佔領當局，趨勢正復相同，四强若不改變此種態度，則德工業殆將有不能充分利用之虞。本人主張魯爾區應予國際化，至於德國其他各部應組織自由聯邦，余相信孤立主義現仍未消滅。</p>
<h3>范登堡論美蘇關係　……蘇聯對於美國在外交上表現之公正與親善，未加報答。</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕參院外委會主席范登堡今日在歇根州總商會發表演說，關蘇聯對於美國在外交上表現之公正與親善，未加報答。范氏此言，係指蘇聯對美國要求解決軍備租借賬目一事置之不理。</p>
<p>租借賬目</p>
<p>范氏並稱，在美蘇兩國之間樹立相互的公平與親善關係，吾人願切心爲之，惟吾人對於此種義務，鮮不實踐，蘇聯則不然。美國戰時租與蘇聯之軍備價値一百十三億美元，從未爲其價値甚巨而稍爲猶豫。但一年來蘇聯對於美國四次提議淸算帳目，完全置之不理。國務院關於租與蘇聯一百廿五艘商船之照會，蘇聯亦不理會，以上二者，不過其顯著者。余敢謂此種經騐，不能促進相互的親善與諒解。</p>
<p>和平願望</p>
<p>范登堡繼稱，美政府堅持蘇聯迅速答復美國照會，此舉不能認爲不友好行爲或有失尊嚴。蘇聯希望和平，與美國之希望和平，初無二致。美國惟求大公無私，偽吾人和平之代價，並深信聯合國保護下之和平，兩國交受其利。吾人對於聯合國應竭忱擁護，惟在證明其能維持和平之前，美國務必保持完全適當之國防。吾人當與蘇聯衷誠合作，以覓致普遍裁軍協定，蘇聯對他國亦應如此。吾人不能單獨裁軍，或僅信賴一紙協定，前車可鑒，不能再蹈覆轍。</p>
<p>原子管制</p>
<p>此一理論亦適用於原子能問題，原子能本身乃文明之威脅，美國保有原子能秘密之數年中，當覓致國際方案，担保在任何地點永遠禁止原子能用於破壞目標。吾人現正作此努力，此乃人類關係史上國際最大信心與善意之表演。吾人決不放棄原子秘密，直至整個地球消滅原子炸彈之威脅可以實現之日，及確保任何違約者迅速受某種懲處之日。</p>
<p>外長會議</p>
<p>未來莫斯科外長會議，或可在各方面促進美蘇諒解。關於此點，余更希望蘇聯遵守其請言，無限制允許美國報紙採訪會議消息，並無限制給予各種便利，此最爲方便且爲賢明云。</p>
<h3>蘇堅主締結公約　促美銷燬原子彈　葛羅米柯猛烈抨擊美方案</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十四日電〕安理會今晚舉行會議，蘇代表葛羅米柯堅主締結國際原子能公的，並抨擊美出席原子能委會前代表巴魯克所提出之計劃。其言略謂，巴魯克所提計劃，規定設立一原子能機構，與普遍裁軍委會互相獨立，殊不足取。安理會五常任理事團若對於原子能管制委會放棄其否決權，殆將使聯合國機構之基礎發生動搖。原子能委會對於管制原子能之建議，迄未意見一致，該委會旣未能遵守聯合國憲章，亦未遵守聯合國大會對於締結國際原子能公約所通過之決議案，國際原子能公約締結之後，可以便利聯合國機構之工作。但美國堅持巴魯克之計劃，致使該項公約不能成立，國際原子能公約之締結，並不干涉原子能之管制制度，要之，美國現正利用繼續製造原子彈，作爲向其他國家施行壓力之方法云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功能湖十日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯今日在安理會嚴厲指責美國繼續製造大規模毀滅武器，並稱，原子能仍被專用於製造武器，此種武器根本即爲侵略武器。美代表奧斯汀指葛氏之言論爲「少數派的報吿」，並謂待閱及葛氏之畫面修正案時，容再發表意見。葛氏稱，美國提案之修正工作，可以進行，但在眞正樹立任何管制之前，原子彈本身必須銷燬。</p>
<h3>南非兩姊妹　化作男子身</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南非開浦鎭十五日電〕此間有某姓姊妹兩人，一十七歲，一十五歲，新近施行手術後，已變爲兩兄弟矣。兩姊妹當初恨不生爲男兒，不期夢想居然實現，快慰莫名。此間醫學界對此手術均發生極大興趣。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦問題無法解決　英決向聯合國機構提出</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕貝文外相今日承認英國欲令猶太人與阿拉伯人接受妥協辦法，雖經長期努力，已告失敗。巴勒斯坦自阿倫培將軍時代以還，久為英國方面一個芒刺，大約將繼續由十萬英軍從事警備，並受現政府管理，以竺聯合國機構有所决定。惟英國今日方急於解决此問題，據外交部發言人表示，英政府或將請安全理事會召開聯合國大會特別會議，討論巴勒斯坦情形。英國雖曾擬具　緬獨立方案，並自埃及撒退駐軍，惟是否願提議永久退出巴勒斯坦，尙無切實表示。英政府是否將向聯合機構提出解決巴勒斯坦問題之特殊方案，或僅將一切提議之方案移交聯今國機構而並不另附建議，下星期一可在下院中宣布。</p>
<h3>英煤荒危局　似已有轉機</h3>

<p>〔聯合社倫教十四日電〕政府發言人今夜宣稱：現有跡象可見英國已戰勝煤荒危局，並已開始恢復工業生產，惟失業人數仍在擴大。艾德禮首相今日與九人緊急委員會討論局部恢復電流供給日期。美總統杜魯門願將美國船上所載煤斤接濟英國，艾德禮已婉辭謝絕，據答復杜氏稱：歐陸需煤孔亟，不下於英，吾人未便將接濟歐陸之煤，改道接濟英國。英國夫業人數已超過五百萬。</p>
<h3>美兩院聯委會　通過縮減預算</h3>
<p>個人所得稅减低二成</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕參衆兩院聯合預算委會，今日以五十票對二十二票之多數，通過將杜魯門總統提出之下財政年度三百七十五億美元預算案，削减六十億美元。同時並徇衆院預算委會主席諾森之提議，减低個人所得稅百分之二十。</p>
<h3>英國防預算</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕國防部長亞歷山大今日發表白皮書，估計一九四八年度英國軍隊需要男女士兵一百〇八萬七千人，除非國際局勢改善，又作別論。去年年底時，軍隊人數共爲一百四十二萬七千人。亞氏估計一九四七——四八財政年度國防支出總預算爲八億九千九百萬鎊，因計算方法之變更，而有上落。</p>

<h3>操縱金價名列黑單　搜集証據決予嚴懲　監察團組織人選決定　抽調數百軍警普查全市交易塲所</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉關於此次金鈔暴漲之原因，軍警當局連日在經濟專家兼名會計師某氏協助之下，調查銀行金號賬目結果，已作初步研究，認爲央行之停止暗拋爲促成投機之重要因素。</p>
<p>操縱金價名列黑單　搜集証據決予嚴懲　監察團組織人選決定　抽調數百軍警普查全市交易塲所</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟偵察網成立之前數日，警備部業已實際開始金潮案之調查工作，目前已吿一段落，據悉，二月一日以後央行拋出之黃金，十之八九爲奸商所套購，操縱金價，壟斷市塲。當局對操縱金似之奸商，業於昨晚擬具黑翠，今日起可望開始行動。　軍令部第二廳廳長鄭介民奉蔣主席令來滬會同警備司令宣鐵吾負責組織經濟監察團，實施緊急措置，昨日起已抽調軍警工作人員數百人，開始普查全市銀行·金號·米店·股市等交易塲所，並偵查監視有操縱嫌疑之人物，準備於查獲實據時，隨時出諸行動。昨日下午二時，軍政機關高級人員並再度在鄭介民寓邸集合討論經濟監察團組織人選，決定團長由宣司令兼任，團員五人，爲警察局行政處長方志超，警備司令部稽查處長陶一珊，市政府參事王新衡，憲兵廿三團團長吳光運及中紡公司季源溥，負責籌劃指揮。下設秘書處，李錚任主任秘書，姜頌平，徐幼祚，張亞民，王仲靑任秘書。至所設之三組：（一）金鈔偵查組，組長徐幼祚兼任。（二）糧食偵查組，王仲靑兼任。（三）紗布偵查組，張亞民兼任。</p>

<p>緊急處置辦法賷呈主席核閱</p>
<p>宣司令昨在警備部接見各報社記者，發表談話稱：「經濟監察團之組織及人事，已於本日下午二時與各有關首長會商決定，並通過緊急處置辦法。該項辦法定於今晚飭交本部副官處，派員送京呈主席核閱，在主席未核准以前，內容暫不公佈。惟經濟監察團對金鈔，糧食，及紗布之檢查工作當照常進行。」宣氏又稱：「關於不決商號或個人之懲辦，緊急處置辦法中，亦有明文規定，凡不法商號或個人，經查明有據者，除公佈其名單外，並歸軍事法庭審判，決予嚴辦。蓋主席令飭必須查明此次掀風作浪，製造漲風之不法商店，或個人名單。現本團已獲有一部份黑單，刻正從事搜集證據，與作進一步之調查中，俟查明，決予嚴懲不貸。宣氏希任界人士，對於不法商號或個人，力加檢舉，如以函件檢舉，可逕交淞滬警備司令部內經濟監察團，如口頭檢舉，可親至警備部該團秘書處報吿。本日爲星期日，明日起本團各組，當正式實施各種檢查。」</p>
<h3>參會社會財政聯席會議　討論金潮物價　歸納結論六點　潘議長晉京攜呈當局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會社會及財政兩委會，爲訂論抑平物價，制止黃余風潮，特於昨日下午舉行聯席會議，由徐副議長主席。潘議長特由京趕返，親臨主持，當晚又乘夜車晋京，出席國防會議。議長於席間報告此次在京商討黃金物價案經過，並稱：中央對於此次本市黃金在漲，物價飛騰，因事關重大，須愼重研究，故目前雖尙無具體表示，但必有重要措置辦法。</p>
<p>對於黃金一點，議長特報吿此次蔣主席曾埀詢上海黃金交易由何種機構經營等情形。嗣有參議員駱淸華徐永祚等提供意見，諾議長轉達中央者。聯席會議討論達三小時最後推駱淸華，徐永祚，嚴諤聲將各議員討論結果，歸納發表市參議會對此案之意見如下（此項意見，並請潘議長携京貢獻政府當局）：（一）此次金鈔在漲，起因雖有多端，而人謀不臧，無可諱言。益以投機操縱者之推波助瀾，遂成不可向邇之勢。現在中央已決定查究，希望能雷厲風行，澈底辦理，務期勿枉勿縱，並盼注重主要，勿稍苛擾。（二）黃金政策中央應重行考慮，愼重決定，以免因謠惑而引起人心之不安。同時對於美鈔，亦當有適宜之處置。（三）物價暴漲，純受金鈔風潮之波動，其本身實無漲價之理由，證以外埠物價低於滬市而益信。且市民購買能力薄弱，利息高昂，若抬價居奇，必將受不良之後果。務希商界人士，明瞭此點，萬勿隨波逐浪，盲從漲價，自眙伊戚，並盼市民出於鎭靜，勿事競購，則狂飆旣過，物價目平。（四）管制物價，爲態付非當局勢之紫急措施，惟事先必須有縝密之攷慮，詳盡之計劃，佐以强有力之機構，方能獲取成效，不再蹈過去失敗之覆轍。（五）配給制度，在原則上應表贊同，惟盼政府能把握充分之物資，庶實行時有足量定時之配給，能應付日用必需之生活，如決定先在京滬二地試行，先從公敎人員曁產業工人着手，推及全市市民，果辦理得宣，自可安定人心，增强效果。（六）管制物價，實行配給，俱爲分配物資之方法，而根本問題，尤在增加生產，充實物資，因之對於生產事業之獎進協助，仍爲當務之急。外傳此次金價狂漲，係去年獲得生產貸款者移購黃金所致，實非事實，深望政府仍本過去協助生產事業之初衷，估計工廠所能生產物資之數量及價値，作為發放貸款之依據，使生產量量加，物資供應無缺，物價自趨平穩。。</p>

<h3>吳市長方主委談話　對「二九慘案後援會」文字　淆混黑白予以駁斥</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕自勸工大樓事件發生後，本市各界均頗注意，吳市長亦，一再聲明必須嚴懲禍首及兇手，而昨日文匯報刊登「二九慘案後援會駁復吳國楨方治的談話」一文，所載多不重事實，而肆意誹謗，殆另有陰謀在。吳市長閱悉後，除責令該會更正外，並對各報記者發表談話，痛予駁斥，茲誌談話要點如后：（一）開會通知，只用「愛用國貨抵制美貨委員會」名義，油印分送各業工會，何以旣不書明地址，又不書明負責人，是否存心含糊，預光準備製法事件，推卸責任。（二）依照各民主國家法律或慣例，如蘇聯公衆集會，須先經政政府准，如英美須通知警察當局，依照我國法律，人民團體，亦須先向社會局請求登記，何以該會旣不依法登記，而且於開會時，亦不通知警局，是吾該會主持人自己認爲超過任何民主國家之法律，抑係蓄畜意製造案件，不願警察事先知悉。（三）開會通知內明白書明，「茲爲推行國貨，挽救工商業危機起見，」並未書明「茲爲推行國貨，抵制美貨，」以此向各業工會發出通知，請其「光臨指敎，」而開會時，據各業工會到會人報告，只唱「趕不走那美軍心不甘」等歌詞，與「推行國貨挽救工商業危機」，毫無關係，是否發出通知時，係蓄謀欺騙各業工會，使其踴躍參加，而開會時，故意文不對題，企圖刦持會塲，鼓動反美情緒。（四）會塲主席團究係如何推選，議程，就理言之，應以推行國貨，挽救工商業危機爲範圍，何以當時議程並不如此。旣請各業工會參加，何以對主席團及議程不徴求同意。此種辦法，是否民主，是否係少數人故意把持。（五）開會旣未通知警局，又不照其召集之目的進行，到會之一部份人士，又顯係受騙到塲。（此點已由各業工會代表向市府聲明）因此發生妨害秩序及傷害人命案件，其責任，於法於理應由開會召集人及主持人負責。（六）受騙之各業工會代表，旣已向市府請願澈查禍首兇手，且無辜之梁仁達身遭慘死，被傷者尙有多人，政府是否應予澈查追究。（七）再在文匯報發表文件之所謂「二九慘案後援會」，據文匯報吿知，並未註明地址及負責人，是否該會主持人又係依照所謂「愛用國貨抵制美貨委員會」之辦法，依樣葫蘆，故意淆混黑白，煽動挑撥，企圖重新製造事件。</p>
<p>又市黨部方主委發表談話，全文如下：「閱十五日文匯報有所謂「二九慘案後援會」駁復吳市長與本人談話一則，文詞閃爍，戾氣滿紙，煽動蠱惑，別具用心在我共軍禍國之際，上海居全國之中心，　國家之安危，當局與人民，無不苦心求治，而播弄是非者，則企圖加運社會之不安，遂其政爭之目的。此種聲明，太不値一答，惟死者梁君遭遇太慘，國家失一靑年，社會加一孀嫠，事之可慟，無過此者，誰爲爲之，孰令致之，是非公道，自有公論，國法始彰，何用狡辯。所謂「二九慘案後援會」之組織，未見法團參加，是否爲政治集團之運用，不得而知。若為同情　君而求代爲昭雪，則此種組織，第一必須尊重國民之立塲，不爲政爭利用，第二必須尊重法律之尊嚴，不雜主觀意見。今日中國邁進民主之時，人民集會結社，均有自由，即各政黨亦皆公開活動，遠非如共黨「解放區」之封鎖可比』本人對於此案，謹再一申意見，以作答復。（一）集會自由，本係民主鐵則，蔣主席亦一再申明，非任何人所能剝奪，亦非任何機關所能干涉，提倡國貨運動，儘可公開集會，乃先後三易會塲，旣無主席團，亦無主席（報紙所載），民主自由，如此神秘，用意安在。（二）查違警法規五十五條第六款之規定，聚衆集會必須通知警局，本市行之有年，即歐美民主國家，亦係如此，集會人安能不知，今不責以開會者　警，而責政府未能盡責，是非顚倒，莫過於此。（三）梁君爲提倡國貨而參加集會，爲會衆互毆而受傷致死，諒亦爲會議召集人之所痛心，然此召集人究係爲誰，　成此慘案之禍首爲誰，兇手又爲誰，政府負有保護人民之責，自當澈底查究，司法責在保障人權，更當依法懲兇。（四）梁案旣已移送法院？一切自應靜待法院處理，講自由者須重法律，談民主者更須重法紀，凡假借自由者，決非民主，而破壞法紀者，更非高唱民主者所應爲。以上所陳，係本人坦白之主張，誠意之忠吿，言盡於此，恕不再答。</p>

<h3>敎部擬利用暑期舉辦　僑敎師資講習會　招收二百學員分中小學二組</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕三十四年夏間，正當歐戰勝利結束之後，盟軍以全力對日作戰，南洋收復指日可待，敎育部爲配合勝利，發展僑敎，特在重慶靑木關舉辦第一期僑敎師資講習會，招收有志靑年，予以短期講習，俟南洋收復後即派赴南洋各地僑民中小學校服務。待講習完畢後，正値我國抗戰勝利，該會畢業學員八十餘人，大部均於去年一年中，介紹前往海外工作，成績極佳。惟近來海外僑校紛紛恢復設置，或創辦新校，師資需要，更爲迫切。雖國內有第一第二兩僑民師範，但海外中學師資目下仍無適當培養之機構。敎育部有鑒於此，擬舉辦第二期僑敎師資講習會，繼續儲備僑校師資，以應需要。聞此次招收二百學員，仍分中學敎師組與小學敎師組。除公開招考外，並得由中央各部會及師範學院保送。講習期間兩個月，供給膳宿及講義文旦等用費。講習期滿，成績及格者發給證書，以後得由敎育部隨時介紹至海外各地僑校服務。據悉：敎育部擬利用暑假期間，舉辦此種講習會，俾各校敎師可以參加，現已指定專員負責籌備。</p>

<h3>市敎局招商承辦　課桌椅　王其昌廠被拒絕投標　呈市參會請飭查眞相</h3>
<p>市敎育局款產股，最近招商承辦課桌椅，有循私不公前獲矛盾之情事，本市參議會接獲王其昌木器廠及上海校具公司具呈控訴要求飭查眞相。王其昌木器廠原呈略稱：「此次敎局招標承製課桌椅一萬副，商等自信深合投標資格，遂備具手續，並隨繳押標費法幣一百萬元，前往登記，而敎局亦認爲合格，准予參加，有投標通吿及標價單可證。詎意二月十二日商等準時前往投標，面被卓春記一家把持，施其鬼域伎倆，使商等拒絕參加，情實本甘。茲將其循私不公，前後矛盾，指摘如下：（一）投標者初爲十二家，繼經審定合格者九家，商等均係審定份子，迨至投標突然變卦，祗准四家，其故意使少數人操縱，得以牟利。（二）卓春記對於課桌椅標價每副爲國幣十一萬三千元，商等祗爲九萬一千六百元及十萬零六千五百元，有已塡之標價單，拒不接受，封存保留可證，兩較相差，爲每副二萬餘元，合計爲兩億餘元，其故意糜費巨額公款，用心所在，不難窺測。」又據上海校具公司原呈稱：「當時監標諸公堅稱，商所呈騐之社會局工商登記，係臨時收據。不是爲憑，拒絕參加，商雖申述理由，不但不予採納，竟云如有遠法等情，爾可提起控訴等語，查該日參加投標商合格者，共有九家之多，經一霎那間，祗准四家，其間向有營造聲譽之陸福順，大抱不平，嚴詞質問，窮辭以對，始准參加，開標結果，楊合記以十萬零四千元得標後，又改爲卓春記十一萬四千元承包。而商原定標價計每副九萬五千元，核與車春記之全部標價，相差達二億元以上。際此國家復興，在在需款，如此捨小而認大，顚倒事實，殊爲不解。」</p>

<p>姊妹作戰　紫隊勝紅</p>
<p>首幕賽女子組女靑紅紫姊妹作戰，裁判王亦樵，女靑紫平日訓練較多，射籃之準確性亦大，故戰來一路領先，結果以卅七比四輕取紅姊妹。笛聲響後，女靑紫錢楚屏首建奇功，紅隊吳民爵還以顏色，紫隊王務醴簡志光分別得分，六比二前導，紅隊秦元英緊迫不捨，一中再中，奈紫隊王務體左右逢源，錢楚屏錦上添花，首節遂以十二比六佔先。二節紅隊吳民爵獨挽狂瀾，所獲甚多，前半時結束，紅隊以十四比十六僅以一球之差落後。易陣再戰，女靑紫錢王陳三先鋒，鼎足天下，分數驟增，第三節十八比廿七，紅隊又漸落後。末節紫隊攻勢仍緊，錢楚屏滿塲飛奔。時問完畢，女靑紫以卅七比廿四輕取女靑紅。</p>

<h3>女籃球今晚有劇戰　綠隊女將逢青聯　甲一組鐵路京對全黑　甲二部晨友迎戰甲申</h3>
<p>女子籃球聯賽，今晚有精彩劇戰，常勝軍綠隊逢戰靑聯，下午五時半起，在市體育館。今日男女聯賽，共計三塲，首塲女子組綠隊逢靑聯，次幕甲二部晨友迎戰甲申，末塲甲一部鐵路京與全黑對壘。門票，仍售二千三千兩種。</p>
<p>女子組綠隊對靑聯，前者自出師以來，每戰皆捷，聲勢喧赫，有蟬聯錦標之把握，麾下將士，均屬歷戰沙塲，黃明媛李蘊芝劉珍寳，矯有游龍，探籃具絕大把握。王維珍吳愛運伍美矣，監守後防，固若金湯，合作純熟，攻守兼長，於滬上娘子軍中，首屈一指。雖隊員陳環治離滬赴京，實力方面，仍然堅强無比。靑聯爲後起中之佼佼者，邇來在兪菊廬督導下，球藝猛晋，楊堅東山再起，鬥力益增，該隊對錦標前途，亦於染指企圖，惜投籃好手孫鳳竹，已吿退隱，不無損失，預料今晚相遇，定有精彩演出。獲勝希望，則綠隊常較濃厚。</p>
<p>甲二部晨友對甲申之戰，晨友係靑年會本屆晨友盃籃球總亞軍，日前表演賽中，以混合隊名義，出戰晨友白，以一球半獲勝，可見其實力之一斑，加之小將王炳初，已病愈登塲，主將史久全由蘇趕來，而黃亦瑞，淩鵬，何增，鮑道惠，　其俠等，亦皆智足多謀，本屆出戰以來，屢挫强敵，氣勢旺盛。甲申在本屆聯意中，勝負參半，成績尙稱滿意，在夏澤人，陶瑩石，孫摩西，顏師魯，朱仲麟等協力下，攻守力量，均屬不弱。</p>
<p>甲一部鐵路京與全黑對壘，前者雖師出以來，連戰皆北，但作戰精神始終如一，合作亦見佳妙。全黑爲烏合之衆，但塺下諸將，均係昔日球壇知名之士，如讓少卿，徐菊生，李　德，陸大詼等，賈幼良亦已自港返滬，今　當可戎裝登爲，今日之戰，關係黃包裏，雙方全力求勝也。今日秩序錄下：</p>

<h3>籃球隊的新大陸　哥倫布實力可畏　汕隊表演精彩輸得服貼</h3>
<p>昨晚籃球聯賽壓軸戰，原係汕隊逢恩卡斯，恩卡斯因故請求改期，改由汕隊與美軍哥倫布隊作友請比賽，雙方戰來極爲精彩，散塲後球迷大呼過癮不止。</p>
<p>哥倫布係最近來滬之美海軍球隊，日前該隊負責人，曾隨海陸靑來市體育館觀戰，擬與各華隊舉行友誼比賽。該隊負責人稱：將在華駐留一月，球迷有福，鹽球隊新大陸，哥倫布已有發現。</p>
<p>哥倫布籃球隊實力頗爲雄厚，但以登塲參戰的來說，昨晚已有十六人，尙有三人未出陣，個個身高力火，戰來有海陸靑與巨人之所長，活潑與殺辣，兼而有之。旣無海陸靑之粗野，亦未有巨人動作之遲鈍。</p>
<p>哥倫布進攻的戰術，是以愛許與克洛密兩長人，立在敵籃下，伸手可觸籃圈，他人只好袖手旁觀。　昨晚汕隊表演，亦甚精彩，允以林維聽之遠攻，在一羣鐵塔似的人陣裏，連中四隻空心籃，眞是令人痛快的事。</p>
<p>汕隊昨日的敗，是光榮的敗，以哥倫布的實力來看，今日上海無出其右者。昨晚的得分差得很小的原因。那是番將特多，大調其兵將，以便各個都有露露身手的機會，然究竟是差點勁，被林維聰等，連連扳回十幾分，哥倫布老將一看，大勢不對，又以老班底出陳，然時不我待，勝的已是不多。</p>
<p>哥倫布球隊制服淺黃色，紫紅褲，班底是愛許（20），克洛寗（13），波薩克（4），泊勃爾（21），勃克（14），位置的分配是中鋒，看衛，左鋒，左衛與右鋒，而其中最利害的獲分之鑰，就是四號的波薩克。（德文）</p>

<h3>古井重波黃金美鈔米糧甫安定　統債忽狂跳一倍　由三千八百元拉高至七千五</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公債昨漲風更甚，法院既有判決，立委復有提議，存款之倍數償付　風聲又濃，統丙晨開四千元，即吿爭買，游資來覓出路，哄抬甚烈，三六〇室五五二室等亦進，雖有大戶若誠德五五〇室六〇四室等獲利出籠，亦難遏買風，遂步拉高至七五〇〇元結束，結果較前收竟吿加倍，甲乙丁戊亦加倍餘有，猛漲二千五至三千七不等，成交達千餘萬元。</p>
<p>又訊，日來金市沉寂，游資又轉向華股公債等發動攻勢。昨日公債在多方之角逐下，價格又吿飛黃騰達。據關係人士分析原因：一因昨日報載：立法院對公債一對一還本辦法，咸表不滿。二因逾期債票補付期限，已延期至本年三月底止。此外市塲又盛傳政府將發行建國金公債，則觀察在發行新債前，舊債勢必先期理楚，以維債信。一說官方資本，曾於去年底時，大批收購公債，俾設法要求政府加成還本。種種傳說，不一而定，統債終於在一片利多聲中，價格扶搖直上。</p>

<p>昨日米糧市况續趨下游，因自審議價提高後，各帮販戶聞訊，皆由郊外運到市區，二市塲來貨數量，急遽增加，總共到二千四百零六石五斗，的比上日增多三倍光景。計南市塲至二五〇五石，北市塲四九〇一·五石。市塲內久無貨樣之樣台上，昨市已能普遍見到，故供源轉多，各米店已能添補如常。兼之軍警當局，組織經濟偵察網，對於糧食方面專行密查囤積操縱之米蠶，故投機者毫無活動餘地，且深恐受罰，均暗中吐脫頗急，嚴重之局勢，至此已不復存在。交易漸趨明期化，形勢亦日見恢復正常。厚薄稻及秈米均一致再降五千元左右，陰變元亦跌萬元，惟高檔白粳仍少應市。</p>
<p>麵粉　重入疲境，因邇來廠配粉供應本銷，已不感缺乏，各零售店去胃懈淡，故交易絕少。初市賣戶充斥，利朗洋粉喊低爲七萬五千元，救統粉亦喊低三萬九千元，但均無受主，故貨主售價漸次退讓。利朗洋粉開低爲七萬三千六百元，救統粉亦低至三萬八千元，篩統二號粉四萬六千元，各牌粉約降低二三千元，有少數成交，其後滲勢仍呈有供少求，脚地允虛。救統粉的三萬七千元，篩統粉的四萬四千元。麩皮以奸商取巧，交易秘密，聞救署派員在塲打聽行情，僅大包連袋宿貨，做開價三萬一千五百元，形勢暗悄異常。大小包雖無交易，而價格均較上日堅挺一二千元，小麥乏交</p>
<p>食油　市勢不振，初市喊價與前市相仿，終以實銷動而不爽，加以各糧行情報疲聲中，人心見軟，客商喊價乃步退。簍生油由二十四萬五千元開盤，跌至廿四萬元。吉桶生油由廿七萬五千元，午收爲廿七萬元，計回低萬元，後市仍少問津者。豆油，崑山貨亦做低萬元，價爲廿九萬元，小車蔴油亦跌五千元，廠淸油廿四萬元，有成交。</p>
<p>雜糧　黃豆，本街零化尙活，前聞東北來貨尙需時日，故大連及天津貨做高一二千元，市况堅定。揀靑到頭稀少，步挺數千元。芝蔴呆定之勢，價乏軒輊，菉豆南洋客胃有納，續加三四千元。紅糧，苞米，酒精廠在市收購，價均上升一二千元，生仁銷化呆滯，市價回落一二萬元。豆餅早平後疲，投機份子消散，價軋軟五百元。</p>
<h3>配油問題　商討未獲結論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市食油廠商謝裕祥，李廷楝，周蔚伯，張超等，於昨日下午四時，往謁吳市長，對本市食油配售，及榨油原料之供應問題，有所商討，惟並未獲具結論。聞明日上午十時，將再度會商，以便討論如何由中信局源源供給平價原料，及維持食油生產之辦法云。</p>
<p>又訊，食油日來雖隨金鈔下跌，聯配處以產區成本增高，靑島生油每担漲爲廿五萬元，如按限價十七萬配出，所遭損失過大，在未合理調整以前，極難恢復配售。又中植廠昨日（十五日）配出棉油七百担，仍照限價十五萬五千元。</p>
<h3>洋米棉花　大批裝運來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美商福來輪船公司代理之「紐堡」號，由南美聖多斯埠，裝運洋米與棉花，的七八千噸來滬，預計本月二十日左右可以到埠。</p>
<p>雜糧肥料運粵</p>
<p>招商局海粵輪，前日自滬駛廣州灣。厦門，計裝豆子三百七十餘包，豆餅二萬五千一百五十塊，麵粉二千包，運往厦門。生仁一千五百五十餘包，生油八十八件運粵。又前日海滬輪駛粵，裝運棉紗一千件，生仁一千二百餘包，茶油二百三十件。</p>
<h3>糖價猛跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市以金價大跌隨之猛降，公會現貨，中砂白及生砂赤均小一二萬元，四牛車白小四五萬元，三半軍白小三四萬元，秘魯細砂小二萬元許，二四粗白棧單僅十九萬四千元至七千元。查台公司標價爲十九萬元，利潤亦屬有限。糖市至此瘋狂時期已過，漸入正常狀態。號貨亦降一二萬元，提可爲十三萬元，順德靑十二萬五千元，共成交百數十包。惟聞產價曾隨申市高翔，但經此挫跌以後，不免形成倒懸之局。</p>
<h3>茶市靜中帶堅</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，不脫靜中帶堅之局面，蓋因貨主續萌居奇扳售之心，致各方買氣雖仍迭茁，卒難隨心所欲，交易雖未許樂觀，而售價方面則異常悄硬。邇來蘇州帮對於茉莉香片，需求甚亟，刻下正擬向本市茶商索取茶樣，俾資選購。又訊：卅四年份祁門陳紅茶，汪裕泰茶號亦有問鼎之勢，目前已與安徽茶葉公司積極磋商。聞價格距離不遠，大致日內即有獲得成交之希望。</p>
<h3>紙類限額分配尙未決定　報館訂購儘先批准　數量列入本年限額以內</h3>
<p>紙張限額分配問題，輸入品管理委員會尙在愼重核辦中，因種類繁多，其用途均須詳細調查，故紙業進口商之資格，迄未核定，而限額之分配，更無法着手，頃悉該會正加緊辦理，本月內可全部解決，該會爲便利新聞事業之需要起見，各報館於去年十二月底前訂購之新聞紙，已儘先批准，許可輸入，此項批准之數量列入本年度限額以內，據输管會負責人談，此次紙張列入限額，其意在節省外匯，今後紙類之输人，決視全國之需要量而定云。</p>
<h3>銀樓交易清淡　拒絕收兌雜牌</h3>
<p>中央銀行昨雖照常配售，因金號無形停業，祗有極少數銀樓申請，爲數僅十五條、銀樓業昨仍照常開市營業，懸牌爲六十六萬元，並取消限購辦法，儘量供售，惟購金飾者，稀若晨星，交易極爲淸淡，而將金飾向其兌換者，除本牌外亦拒絕收兌，蓋各銀樓在當局整個穩定金融辦法未宣佈前，雅不願祖風險，遭損失，均抱觀望態度，以待時機云。</p>
<h3>棉布布況趨疲</h3>
<p>棉布市况，因週五紡建公司配售細布均照單購得，致市上現貨充斥，而染廠則納胃轉滯。昨又照例開售藍鷄白坯，價爲十四萬五千元，人心一致趨疲。各檔細布猛降一萬元至一萬五六千元，跳鯉漂布挫二萬元，深色士林美亭亦見回小萬元左右。</p>
<h3>金鈔風平浪靜</h3>
<p>烚赤昨央行雖配給不多，人心尙定，低後稍升，晨開在五九〇萬至六一〇萬，存多續有了結，曾低落至五八萬，即有實銷加以維持，而轉平穩，逐漸回好，十時後央行以六三〇萬之價，配給一五條，此後高價曾達六六〇萬，近午曾回落至六二〇萬，午刻在六三〇萬及六四〇萬間徘徊，午後逢週六無甚活動，喊價在六三〇萬左右，結果較前收微升，飾金掛六十六萬元，銀元再降少許，暗拆銀根見鬆，暗息不過一角半光景。</p>
<p>外幣昨甚平靜，美鈔晴盤在一萬二至一萬三間徘徊，自晨迄午，並無特變，午後逢週六，更無變化，結果較前收未分榮辱。港票稍低，港申電回升至四〇元之故，結果續降二百元。港匯二六五〇元，印匯三二五〇元，英匯四二四〇〇元，除港匯外，並無多大成交。</p>
<h3>中央銀行將商討　絲商歸還春貸問題</h3>
<p>自政府頒佈收購秋絲，由中央信託局開始主辦以來，各廠陸續交送者，截至本月四日止，計達一一八七担。包括秋絲入六二担，零烘繭絲三二五担。據估計全部秋絲連同零烘繭在內，總計的二千八百餘担，是則中信局所收購者懂及四分之一。至廠商遲遲送交原因，據悉：係中央銀行按照規定，凡春繭貸款尙未淸了者，須將繅成春絲按每担三百八十元送中信局收購，還淸春貸後，方可收購秋絲。廠商以現款歸還春貸則拒絕收受。</p>
<p>廠商意見　又據廠商意見如次：（一）收繭較多者，繅絲期間自必延長，在去年八九月以前繅成生絲，照每担三百八十萬元收購，尙不致虧本過甚。在以後繅成生絲，因繅工隨物價激增，再以利息負担，每担成本已達四百五十萬至五百餘萬元。如目前絲價低於三百八十萬元，則廠商祗有忍痛送購。爲避免政府麻煩計，不再另請加價。現市價超出三百八十萬元，廠商爲减少虧耗，似不能放棄機會。（二）資力薄弱廠商，因支付春繭貸款三成墊款，及保險與預付利息等，週轉不靈，受高利貸剝削，春絲虧本甚鉅，無法停工，被迫將繅成之絲出押或售去。如必需照三百八十萬元送購春絲歸還春貸，勢所難能。又悉：央行對此問題已深切注意，並定明日下午三時，召集第三區繅絲業公曾，及春繭貸款處各負責人開會討論，預料不難謀取合理途徑以解決云。</p>
<h3>核配會討論　民營紗廠存棉</h3>
<p>外棉核配會，除曾於上月按緊急申請，核配各國營紗廠及少數民營紗廠之購棉外，對大部民營紗廠之核配，因申報存棉及製表結算工作，迄昨日始行完竣，故該會將於今日召集會議，討論各民營紗廠存棉量及購棉之核配事宜，昨據該會負責人稱，目前各民營紗廠之存棉量，大部份至少均能維持二個月以上之生產，雖有少數工廠現棉即將枯竭，然爲數極微，且此次之審核尺度亦持寬大原則，對各廠依每月開工二十六天及現有錠數計算，至因停電而停工及若干已損壞之錠子均未予扣除。</p>
<h3>同業乘廉收進　紗市由疲轉堅</h3>
<p>昨日紗市始疲終堅，晨初因聞金市無形停頓，執貨者一時情虛，貶價傾售，特雙馬價挫至四百萬大關，紅魁星低見三百十萬，旋以同業乘廉收進，價復冉冉上揚，迄收盤，前者到四百四十萬，後者升至三百三十五萬，結果榮辱互見，大致與前日行市相彷</p>
<h3>棉紗品質低劣　紡管收購困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會收購棉紗，刻已有十餘家紗廠將棧單繳進。據該會負責人談稱：該會此次撿騐各廠紗樣，發覺其中對F及G兩級標準，均不及格。為顧全事實上之困難計，將來可能取消此項等級。又評定各紗廠紗樣等級，絕大部份均列入戊級，列入甲級者極少。按照規定，列入戊級之棉紗，其收購價須扣除百分之十，故該會深望各紗廠應力求改進棉紗品質云。</p>
<h3>新買斷加入　華股漲風仍熾</h3>
<p>華股昨以實力派手中之籌碼，迄無放出，新買仍不斷來進，空方再遭潰敗，漲風仍熾，晨開現交各股尙見續低，遞交登塲，突吿回漲，開後遂吿爭買，七八號二二四號一五二號一四五號二三二號一八一號一八八號均進，檯面帮猛抬，立吿上騰，華豐首先漲停，遞永紗漲到一六七五元，一〇五號九一號一五五號一三三號脫手而退至一六一〇元，二二四號出後即進，八五號二二號來進，升至一六六〇元，一七七號一四五號二二四號二〇四號一八六號尙售，而降至一六一〇元，十一時左右，大起徘徊，在一六一〇元及一六四〇元間盤旋不定，後以四號八五號一五五號一四號一八一號一五一號一一二號八四號九七號五七號均進，十一時半，買風大起，檯面帮力抬不已，而回漲到一七一五元，一八八號一八四號一八一號逢高急售，退至一六七〇元，九七號四號五七號一七號尙進，一二五號一二九號一九八號一〇六號一四五號一八八號一二號一五六號則賣，午刻遂自一七〇〇元外，再回落至一六七〇元左右掙扎，浮多十分擁擠，塲外貼息二角五分半以及三角不等，結果較前收計永紗景福升一成，華豐漲停，信和美亞新光勤興各升半成强，遞交計永紗升一成，華豐漲停，美亞新光信和各升半成強，冷股商務火柴升半成强，內衣國貨微降，水泥升成半，餘均微升，塲外各股中華世界平穩外，餘者各微升及升一成不等。</p>
<p>外股昨亦吿回升，各股極見穩定，結果較前收計鋼業英聯會德豐業廣紙業怡啤航業均吿微升，怡紗升起半成。</p>
<h3>行總代理廠商　向美訂購工礦材料</h3>
<p>行總爲救濟全國因戰事毀壞之工廠商店及發展國內工業起見，最近與美國洽商，訂到大批工礦器材，自來水，電廠設備用具及建築材料如水泥紅磚鋸木等，頃悉業由該署工礦委員會決定，擬即公開配售各需要商民，凡公營事業機關或經經濟部核准設立之工商公司，確受戰事損失而本身無力發展營業者，可向各地分署或中中交農四銀行及中信局郵儲局辦理申請手續，至於訂購材料分現貨與期貨兩種，現貨交款取貨，以美元爲單位，法幣可按中央銀行法定價格折算。期貨分三次付款，並由收款銀行承認法定息金（月息七厘），待交貨時一併計算云。</p>
<h3>桐油產地報漲　椰子油回瀉甚烈</h3>
<p>桐油市價每担又升二萬元，產地迭報漲訊，尤以湘漢方面，桐油之堅悄冠於全國，滬市足度桐油已無輸出可言，行商亦僅供內銷之用途，據業中人云，桐油產地報漲，滬市不易趨平。　椰子油昨市下瀉甚烈，每担做價爲五〇萬元，散戶售出者甚多，柏油以到貨不多，實銷未減，價站原盤，牛油市價雖張，每担四十八萬元，但無多量成交，零星交易，每祖最好者的爲四十五六萬元。</p>
<h3>紡建開售棉布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司，昨日循例售布，共售一〇五七〇疋。申購者計廠家十四戶，每戶最高申請額，爲六〇〇疋。號家八十六戶，每戶一包，計四十疋。配售之布疋中，計細布八九六〇疋，色布一六一〇疋云。</p>
<h3>華南紗價高　南運申請多</h3>
<p>第四期紗布南運定本月廿五日截止，過去數期中，紗之申請數量，較布爲多，此期申請者更多，據一般推測，華南一帶之紗價較本市爲高，故各商均爭運往該處銷售，舫管當局爲限制此項紗布大量運出，對審核方面仍按規定，嚴加處理云。</p>
<h3>京管理糧食　訂辦法五項</h3>
<p>南京航訊，京市糧價在漲，市府已飭社會局擬訂糧食業甲請配購食糧辦法，其內容如下：（一）糧商應按照平日營業狀况，塡具申請書，由該業同業公會核定其每日所需數量後，轉報市社會局，並向指定銀行繳款，向指定倉庫提糧，（二）配購糧食出售利潤，除購價加運費外，售米所得不得超過百分之六，售麵粉所得不得超過百分之五，。並應一律標價發售，（三）供應糧食之數量及糧食價格，由社會局會同糧食主管機關商定之，（四）糧商對米五斗或粉一包以上之購戶應將其姓名住址。詳細登記，以便抽查，（五）糧商配購之食米或粉，應隨購隨售，不得囤積或轉售，上項規定，已呈行政院核准及糧食部備案，如有違反（三）（四）（五）項者，聞將照非常時期違反糧食管理治罪條例處分云。</p>

<h3>中菲友好條約　半年來折衝樽俎的內幕</h3>
<p>— 馬尼刺四日航訊本報駐菲記者林申</p>
<p>菲島華僑在蒙受「中菲友好條約」恩澤之餘，當然立刻會回想到這條約的播種者前任菲島總領事段茂瀾博士。</p>
<p>中菲友好條約之發起，是在菲島光復後。段博士就任不久，因鑒於排華之風甚熾，爲一勞永逸計，急須成立兩國間之友好條約文件，以便有所依據，且菲島已吿獨立，爲華僑之生存與保隙計，中菲兩國間之條約更爲迫需。</p>
<p>播種者　段茂瀾博士</p>
<p>一九四五年十一月，段博士曾與美駐菲最高專員麥叻氏提出討論，其時菲島尙未獨立，外交事猶在美最高專員署內辦理，當即獲得麥助氏之贊同，允予協助，並向段博士建議：與當時菲總統奧斯敏邇氏正式商談，段博士乃向我國外交部請示，正値我國還部南京之秋，故久未得回音。</p>
<p>至一九四六年三月，外部電令段博士向菲方試談訂的事，段博士遵命前往，當即得菲前總統奧示敏邇氏及當時美菲當局所親織之外交委員會之贊成，然又値奧總統與現任總統羅哈斯競選正烈，條約事又暫爲躭擱。直至菲島獨立，現任羅哈斯總統就職。</p>
<p>一九四六年六月，我領館始接我外部以電報打來之全部條約文　，囑段博士加以研究，並斟酌向即將正式獨立之菲政府提出。段博士經一翻研究後，即將稿文全部提交菲總統羅哈斯。不久，菲島獨立，菲外交部成立，我政府派特使甘乃光及條約司長王化成等來菲觀禮，擬即乘機與菲方商談締的，然以甘氏在菲時間短速，並無具體之成就，故仍由段博士承辦，嗣後段陣士即與菲外長兼副總統基里諾氏數度磋商討論，至同年八月間，菲方始首决提出修正案，修正我方條約草稿如次：</p>
<p>菲首次提修正案</p>
<p>（甲）菲方要求加入者：</p>
<p>（一）締約國是主權國，有權頒布任何法律，另一締的國之僑居人民有專守之義務。（按：此項若被認可，菲政府此後如頒佈一法案，謂華僑不得經營零售商及批發商，即吾僑亦有遵守之務，此爲友好條約上所明文規定。）</p>
<p>（二）兩締的國不得用武力解決糾紛，而應以調解或仲裁解決之。</p>
<p>（三）締的國人民在另一締的國內，不得參加政治活動。</p>
<p>（四）締約國在作戰時，得徵召另締約國人民服兵役。</p>
<p>（五）菲共和國予美國之特權，中國不得享受。</p>
<p>（乙）菲方要求取消之數點：</p>
<p>（一）締約國人民在另一締的國內之身體財產之安全保障。</p>
<p>（二）關於司法事件及納稅義務之國民待遇。</p>
<p>（三）取消出入國境，旅行，居住的最惠國待遇，而遵照締結國內之法律。</p>
<p>（四）取消關于學校，敎堂，公墓等及取得繼承，轉移，處置動產與不動產的最惠國待遇。</p>
<p>我方提出修正案</p>
<p>以上所述菲方取消之第一第二項，當日由段博士與菲外長基里諾交涉，菲方應其所請，即予加入。段博士旋即乘機返京請示，三星期後返馬尼刺市向菲方提出我方之修正案，計下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）關於一國有主權頒布法律及兩締的國不應用武力解決糾紛之事，乃爲國際間所公認，現更有聯合國組織之規定，此點可不必在條約中說明。</p>
<p>（二）關於前此所提之「最惠國待遇」一則，吾國係採取對各國人民一律平等之主義，爲避免歧視計，應加入條文中，別無他意。</p>
<p>（三）關於締的國人民不得參與另一締約國內之政治活動，此乃當然之事，似無需列入。</p>
<p>（四）締的國之一國如參加戰事，而其戰事爲聯合國組織所禁止者，如另一締的國人民有服兵役之義務，即有違聯合國之意，故條的上不應有。且友好條約內通常不涉及徵兵之事。</p>
<p>（五）美國在菲之特權，中國承認不能同等享受，但對原條文作文字上之修改。</p>
<p>菲方接到以上之修正案後，久未答覆，後陳公使質平由美到達，公使館成立，至一九四六年，十月五日尙未有答覆，段博士以渠返國在即，特再走訪菲外長詳談修正案內容。隔三日，菲外長即將覆文送使館，內容除刪去締的國人民不得參與另一國之政治活動外，對我方所修正之數點仍相持不下。嗣後，段博士銜命赴英京就新職，遂將菲方之對案携歸，呈外部考慮，不久外部即訓令公使館囑照前意繼續進行磋商</p>
<p>再度磋商之結論</p>
<p>至十月二十七日，陳質平公使與菲外長兼副總統基里諾詳談，始得下列四結論：</p>
<p>（一）菲政府同意取消締的國有權頒布任何法律，另一締的國之國民有遵守之義務一則。（按：菲人在我國內之權益少”而我在菲之權益多，若菲國頒布不利我國國民之法律，我國亦頒布同樣不利菲國國民之法律與之抗拒，菲國實際上無影響。）</p>
<p>（二）菲同意加入最惠國待遇一項</p>
<p>（三）徵兵一項，菲方堅持不放。（按：菲民僑居吾國者，不過數百名音樂師，而我在菲僑民，人數達十餘萬。）　隔日，陳質平公使再與菲外長會見，再談徵兵問題，欲將「徵兵」二字改爲「志願兵」，爭辯達三小時之久，結果菲方仍未能請示·一連在京逗留四十天。至十二月十號，返馬尼拉市，翌日謁菲外長。經詳談後，好容易始有如下結果：</p>
<p>（一）菲方同意取消徵兵。</p>
<p>（二）關於美國在菲之特權，我方承認不能同等享受，但要求菲方如將此諸時權予美國以外之任何第三國，中國將同等享受之。</p>
<p>（三）「不能用武力解決糾紛」我方接受，並加人用外交方式調解或仲裁辦法解決之。</p>
<p>簽約前　一點小曲折</p>
<p>由此觀之，此時雙方意見，大體已趨於一致，是以雙方均準備簽約。可是菲方最後文稿遲遲未交出。至本年正月十日，始知菲方之所以未將最後文稿交出者，原來還有曲折。是日提出更改三點：</p>
<p>（一）中國如欲享受菲國予美國以外之第三國之特權，其條件與該第三國相同。（意謂設若英國人取得在菲之採礦權，係以允許菲人在英國領海內採魚爲附帶條件，即中國欲享受在菲之捕礦權，亦須允許菲人在中國海捕魚。）</p>
<p>（二）中國如以特權予在任何第三國，即菲國在同樣之條件下亦可享受之。意謂（若中國予美國以航空權，即菲人亦得享受。）</p>
<p>（三）本約之締的國之一方，如欲終止此的，應於一年前預先通知對方。</p>
<p>我外部　表示兩意見</p>
<p>公使館接獲此三項更改文後，電吿外部請示，外部遂訓令公使館向菲方表示下列二點意見：</p>
<p>（一）中國對任何國家一律平等，並無任何特權予任何國，故菲方最後一節之要求，不需加入。</p>
<p>（二）條約之終止，若如此規定，有效期間可能爲一年，如堅持需加入此項規定，即需加入固定有效時期爲十年或廿年。</p>
<p>中菲友好條約談判至此，自段博士以的稿提送羅哈斯總統時起，已歷時半載。主要之數項，雙方均已同意。餘下之問題僅屬小節問題，及文字上之修飾。故陳公使於本年正月之廿九日與菲外長會見後，遂產生「四人小組委員會」，菲方係其外次亞飛加氏（Africa）及法律專員瑪丹巴氏（Madamba）我方爲使館孫　奇與薛毓麒二秘書，以便對條文全文之文字上及小節上作最後之詳細研究，並決定一雙方所能同意之形式，以備二國全權代表簽字。　中菲友好條約半載以來談判經過，已如上述，而條約中之主要點亦即如上述。</p>
<p>此次爲了訂立中菲友好條約，代表我國參加談判者，爲前總領事段茂瀾博士，秘書薛毓麒。繼續努力而完成其事者，爲陳質平公使，孫碧奇，薛毓麒二秘書。　代表菲方參加談判者，爲菲外長兼副總統基里諾，外决亞飛加，法律專員瑪丹巴。</p>

<p>葉於二十年前在法成婚，所生兩子一女，均長大，其女且在學校任講師職。一家充裕，自身泰然若封翁，安享人間幸福，遠非國內『叉麻雀以耗光陰，忙奔競以希榮寵者』所能想望。</p>
<p>而督騐一切出品以應法方購求之朱先生，早歲出國之時已能畫，人物花卉山水之屬無不能。及抵法京，因佛郞漸昂，國幣外兌之價日以落，乃變計半學半工，一面進美術學院受課，一面即自設木器雕飾工塲。計其出品，名色繁多。</p>
<p>（一）雕花板，又名木板空雕。Panneaux　Sculptes（如第一圖板廚左右門上端兩塡心板，及第三圖榻床左右兩側面之床欄塡心板），（二）刻漆，須先在木器之上連漆十幾次，約有二分厚之時，乃在漆面施雕刻。</p>
<p>西人珍視　珂珞珉</p>
<p>（三）最足照示中國工藝特長之漆器，名曰雕綫，即福建漆，乃先上漆而後雕，著色，並細描，作Coromandel珂珞珉。傳說庚庚子拳　聯軍擾北平，掠取珍器寶物，滿載而西，軍艦行抵英領印度東部之珂珞珉海口，失事沈沒，隔一年餘，撈起水中物，一切皆毀敗，獨中國之漆器，尙見完好如初，西人珍視此類漆器，即加以珂珞珉之別名。凡木器之刷洋漆而施雕刻者，弊在怕熱，中國漆之又一優點爲耐熱，鬥而特受西方社會之歡迎。（四）刻綫Laque　Grave先上漆，後畫，再很離刻，亦中國所特有。（五）突起金色畫。Relier　en　or，（六）浮雕著色。Relief　en　Couleu以上兩端，大同小異。（七）金綫描畫Laqued'or，先上漆，後施金色畫，再後金色細描，（如第一圈左右兩廚門下方大半截之塡心板），（八）綴色畫Polychrome，中國所特有，分爲古與新，乃先上漆，後著已，再後金綫細描。（九）　嵌Incrustation先就板面深刻花紋或烏獸人物山水等形，而後塡入螺殻Nacre或石片pierre，此法在歐洲，不能製作而僅能修理。（如第二岡榻牀下方牀架之細工），其鏤嵌之成於日本者，則先上金，後嵌象牙或魚骨，日本人之雕綫漆器，師法中國福建漆，而又從事改善其製”輒爲中國而上之，綴色畫則波斯所爲，中國式大同小異，其有異於中國者，彼乃金畫又兼金底之細描，法國路易十五世暨十六世朝之古式木器，亦分『雕綫』『突起金描」「金綫描畫」『綴色畫』等門，聞均先由遠航東土之荷人，得諸中國效其法，法國極名貴之舊漆器，以在法國先成模型，送中國漆就之後，再送回歐者爲最上</p>
<p>法人模擬　中國畫</p>
<p>法人模仿中國畫，在歐就地仿製者次之，西方藝術之得力於近世海上交通，隱受響慕華風之影響者，磁器而外，似惟漆器，如有心人，搜集史材，輔以圖繪，輯爲中外木器雕飾之專著，其必不脛而走，引起國人挾藝以走天下之自信心，豈僅是裨益民生而補助國計已哉？</p>

<h3>打游擊與做流寇！</h3>
<p>舊曆年前，我們得着一個不幸消息，延安已正式拒絕和平使者重開談判，除非政府承認其先提兩條件，此後內戰將長期打下去。去年五月國軍打下長春，延安方面宣布，以後將打二十年游擊，去年十二月十九日文匯報所登周恩來談話：「中共將於六個月內破壞政府軍事攻勢，一年之內，中國整個政府與經濟機構將有重大改變。」國共兩軍能有決定性的解決，總比現在拖的局勢好，但是中國整個政府與經濟機構將有重大改樊，我們小百姓聽了，眞是恐怕得很。現在交通破壞，物價高漲，人民已經被壓得喘不過氣來，假使再擴大破壞，中國將成爲一種什麼局勢，眞是不堪想像。中共所謂改樊現狀，即是極端破壞，也就是打游擊的結果。在去年中共失去長春·承德·淮陰·荷澤·張家口·安東之後，雖然在蘇北魯南尙有激戰的尾聲，中共戰略，在大體上，已改爲打游擊性質，不與國軍作正面衝突，避實就虛，避强就弱，一竄數百里，或東或西，或南或北，飄忽無定，每到一處，除裏刦壯丁，掠取物資外，一切皆加以破壞，其情形，頗有似於明末之流寇。</p>
<p>自前年八月日本投降到現在，國共關係，談談打打，打打談談，邊打邊談，邊談邊打，至今已到全面決裂地步，政府仍擬派張治中往延安，重開和談，不料延安加以拒絕，此後將長期游擊下去。我們大家眞有點爲國家前途寒心！</p>
<p>當然中共有主義，有組織，絕對與流寇不同，不過其所行之政策，所取之手段，有傷於國家元氣，有害於人民生活，與流寇的影響，又有何別？游擊一直打下去，十年，二十年，中國不但在國際上失去五强之一的地位，恐怕要打入十八層地獄，永遠不得翻身了。所以我們大家希望，假使中共一定要打的話，不妨與國軍來一決定性的解決，不要像流寇東竄西竄，固執打游擊的戰衛，徒苦人民。同時我們又希望政府，堅定其政策，不要像明末政府對流寇之勦撫不定。我們小百姓，當然不要有戰爭，然而再長久拖下去，實在受不了，兩害之中取其輕，寗顧國共爭端在短期間，有一決定性的解決。同時我們大家十二分的熱望國共之間，有一奇蹟，突然的出現，兩黨携手合作，和衷共濟，以使國家踏上建設的路迹。（陳詒先）</p>

<h3>關良畫藝論</h3>
<p>— 史岩</p>
<p>關良先生是一位多才多藝的人：他是西畫作家，近年也好嘗試新的國畫；他又是小提琴的高手，醉心於着邦的夜曲；他對於國畫　有研究，能唱能演能湊，頗得箇中三昧；但其畢生精力的重心是集中在繪畫道創造之業上，他的藉藉之名亦在繪畫的成就上。他獻身於中國畫壇已有二十餘個的歷史，他在藝術上的造詣頗深，用我眼光來看，他已卓然成家了，不過現階級的作品，已與戰前劃然異趣，他已洞澈了藝術創造之眞諦，他已確立了他特殊的主張，他已決定了他應走的方向，所以他已產生了一種新的獨特的作風了。這是値得吾人注視的事，我曾膚淺的加以分析，關良先生今日的藝術有二大特徵：</p>
<p>（一）具有獨創精神——藝術是一種創造，非「再現」而是「表現」，將美的實景造成一種假象時，　拘泥自然的形態，祗求忠　　　摹對象的原狀，這便是「再現」。所謂「表現」，雖然也是把美的實景造成偽象，可是這偽象的形成，是用了作家的獨有的手法，並加入了作家的「個性」在內，使作品有了獨特的面目。換句話說：這便是所謂「獨特的精神」。眞正的藝術，非有此種富有創造性的獨創的要素不可，一個作家若缺乏自我表現的能力，但求形似，那就成了工匠。</p>
<p>關良先生的性情，溫厚雅逸，沉默寡言，言則低聲緩氣，頗有學者風度。他的近作，頗能與這種個性相一致。色調單純，富含淡雅明快的韻味；　觸簡練，頗有渾厚堅實的骨氣；取材更異於尋常，好作巴山蜀水占賢勝蹟，於是奇峯怪岩　溪巨流，均湧現於其腕底，形成中國山水盡那樣的境界；因此構圖亦　脫了西洋風景畫的窠臼，位置經營，亦類中國平遠山水畫的意境。故其作品，處處顯示不落常套，躍動着獨創的精神。</p>
<p>氏近作，除水彩油畫外，又好用國產的紙墨試作新的國畫。以寥寥的數筆，捕捉剎那的印象，表現動熊的人物。此種企圖亦相當成功。或謂這祇是墨戲而已，又或謂這似八大石濤，我今不加批判；惟其洗練的點綫，對比的彩色，表現複雜的時間性的動態，竟能活動紙面，此種獨特的表現技能，茍非功夫達到純化的境域，不得臻此。在這種，亦足窺見作者技巧出神入化及其獨創的精神了。</p>
<p>（二）富含民族色彩—民族性亦為藝術創作上不可缺乏一大要素。藝術家為一民族或一國家的一份子，其藝術當然是民族的產物，所以一件藝術品缺乏民族性的因素，就等亽失掉靈魂，一國的文化應有一國的特徵，一民族的藝術應有其獨自的面目；可是我國的西畫作家，能注意及此並能做到的，眞是鳳毛麟角。自西洋藝術隨了時代的潮流輸入中國以來，一般藝術工作者但知依樣葫蘆生呑知嚥，失却了民族的靈魂。他們不僅忽視文化是民族性的反映，不僅不知道中華民族精神的特色所在；他們進面摒棄中國舊有的一切，反對中國固有的藝術，認為是陳腐，是落後。第二次世界大戰的砲火，喚醒了各弱小民族的意識，紛紛揭起了民族解放的大　，但在中國，雖經八年的對日作戰，這種民族意識的覺醒程度，並不怎樣顯着，至少藝術界是還在半醒半睡的狀態中。論理藝術家是有着銳敏的感覺，此種意識的顯露，應該來得特別强烈而成為大時代的急先鋒。所幸少數頭腦清新的作家，他們已覺得盲學西洋不啻做了西洋文化侵略的走卒，已知道西畫的在國內這樣喧賓奪主取國畫地位而代之的情勢，是一種不正常的發展，長此以往，行將喪失中國固有的文化，並已明瞭吸收異域文化不應囫圇吞棗，而應細嚼之消化之，成為自己的營養，變成自己的血液，因而回心轉意，憑着潛在的民族意識，恢復了他本位上的努力，運用西華的基礎，改變作風來發揮民族精神的特質了。關良先生　風的轉變之原由，不一定如我所說。轉變的原因本不止一端，時代·年齡·思想·之類都有關係；但他的轉變的趨向，是回歸民族的懷抱，是站上本份的崗位，這是事實——可貴的事實。在他的畫面上，無論從取景佈局色調筆觸各方面來看，都充滿着恬靜淡泊超逸的情趣，物質材料儘管是西洋的，而其內在却洋溢中國的氣派，中國民族的一貫的精神。或以為此是受了西洋後期的印象派的感染，但是在他的畫面上並找不見塞尚果根或是馬蒂斯的面影。現今一般藝術欣賞家與西華作家仍保持着同一的步調一貫的主張，他們的立塲多是西洋，作家是注視西洋，摸學的西洋，欣賞者於欣賞國人的西畫時也好以西洋作家一比擬，這種失掉靈魂忘却祖國的看法，常激起我潛然的悲哀。由國難道一輩子跳不出模倣的桎梏！？難道永遠不會產生獨創的作家！？我覺得關氏的畫風是富有創作感，除以「中國民族性的顯露」一語加以釋外，其他的比喻頗屬牽强而無聊。</p>
<p>南宋趙希鵠會諭畫謂：</p>
<p>「胸中藏華萬卷，飽覽前代奇蹟，車轍馬跡半天下，方能下筆，是豈賤者之所能為事耶？」</p>
<p>數語，頗可玩味。關氏因好遊山玩水，故其胸襟開曠，下筆不凡，他的作品所以能卓然獨樹一種風格的緣故，大槪是得力於此的吧？</p>
<h3>韓安義的油畫</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>說也可憐，中國的新興藝術運動掀起已逾三十五年，而比較科學的油畫的技法，依然沒有很多人去注意與運用，而所謂中國藝術，確是沉滯於毛筆，水墨和宣紙一類的器材之上。固然，藝術的創造，並不單純地繫於器材，但器材的運用，畢竟會決定藝術的進步與停滯的。</p>
<p>油畫在西洋藝術上，因為它具有高度的表現效果，所以它是主要的藝術器材，也就是構成了主要的造型藝術的技法，不論在那一個國家，那一個作家，可能列為重要藝術品或代表作的，總是油畫。又因為它可以析成複雜的色相，在十九世紀下半期的印象主義運動，也就以油畫為它的主要器材，描表色光的變幻。</p>
<p>回顧吾國新興藝運動進程之中，油畫也曾風靡一時的，可是，抗戰以來，一般作家迫於物質與生活的威脅，油畫的製作與研究，幾乎全被國畫來替代。因為國畫可以換錢，解決生活，雖然有若干地方，作家是在迎合暴發戶的附庸風雅的心理，但藝術家的貧困也就得解圍了。</p>
<p>固然我們也可說：國畫是我國文化的優越傅統，研究國畫是一件良好的傾向。但歐美的科學物質生產，我們是趨之若鶩，為什麽受過科學洗禮的油華技法與器材，反而放棄不顧呢？</p>
<p>韓安義女士，是一位專心研究油的青年作家，在近五六年來的上海畫壇上相當活躍，作品曾陳列於廿九年的上海洋畫家聯展，卅年的現代畫展，以及去年兩次的上海美術作家協會展，勝利美展等。論其作風，只是走廿世紀初頭塞尚以後的一條正路。因之表現質感非常堅實，這幅「魚」便有特朗的新寫實的特徵。在她的許多風景畫上，往往可以感覺到洋溢着亨利·羅騒的稚拙的趣味。這就是主觀表現藝術的一種特異的傾向，也就是現代藝術一致的傾向。</p>
<p>現階段的中國藝術界，油畫研習者是如何的稀少，因之，像韓安義女士，始終致力於油畫之上，是一個藝術的虔誠者，我們是應該怎樣的促使她發展和長成。因為：中國新藝術的創造，油畫技法畢竟會成為主要的因素之一。</p>
<p>聽說：韓女士已在準備個展期中，我先為介紹使藝術的愛好者注意，也使她自己獲得一些小小的鼓勵。</p>

<h3>昔以鄭午昌山水合錦贈樓　佩蘭，經亂散失，回京後忽於荒肆得之，因索重題。</h3>
<p>— 錢智修</p>
<p>樓侯胸羅大九州，多情好事世莫鑄，平生愛山　愛畫，　衍廠弄皆琳球。我得午昌記行作，山石鄒廋山巒，為君新居張素壁，風生高屋寒颼颼。島夷犯順揮利矛，上京冀冀鹿豖遊，萬官盡作南飛鵲，君亦遂買西行舟。歸來四壁渺無物，但有塵綱買蛛蝥，君因重我更重畫，荒攤冷肆勞冥搜。眼明忽如逢故劍，心喜不减醉醇甌，信知物聚於所好，事有天助非人謀。我生寓物物不留，空禪早已忝牛頭，寒齊青氈亦何有，過眼但若浮雲浮。楚弓何必由我得，明珠况更非暗投，題詩報君鄭重意，但願金石交契永與此畫同千秋。</p>
<h3>答經宇丈步原韻</h3>
<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>殘山賸水話神州，一角馬家心與鑄，何意多情錢學士，實之勿失若琳球。烟雲過眼等閒事，謂可怡然養其幽，樓侯絕世有同好，每談丘壑風颼颼。障壁不嫌塗鴉拙，胡床相對恣臥遊，亂離文物賤於土，西狩東巡履覆舟。虜蹄踏處無完屋，所餘人骨與蛛蝥，春城重到深草木，何嗜尺素費窮搜。翰墨因緣或有定，得之喜甚酒盈甌。河山重新畫重返，是乃天助豈人謀。多君愛逾梁千尉，愧我手非顧虎頭，安得遊遊窮五岳，乘槎更逐四海浮。寫取奇異千萬幅，紛向高明壁上投，區區得失勞喜戚，交情紙上證千秋。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　166</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>W君在履行職務，和對部下執罰的行動上，心腸簡直比鋼鐵還硬，然而聽我念了這幾句，早已咬牙切齒，看樣子是憤恨極了，而眼睛上已起了一圈紅暈，這時却瞧着我，意思叫我把信念下去：</p>
<p>「據申君言，拙荆係偕長次二女，懸　自盡，恐遭禽獸蹂躪也，死得極其乾凈，可以略慰我心；蓋雖遭橫死，猶較愈於長辛店百餘清白婦女，被日寇輸姦，欲死不得者！申君又言，內子及二女，尸身負有槍傷數處，刀傷亦有數處，惟流血不多，想係傷在已死之後。敵獸何恨？乃必欲戮尸？豈恨未　其　獠，未快其獸慾也。聞二子死狀極慘，各負刀創數處，肢體亦被磔斷；指甲拳曲，留有斷髪布片，當係生前，捍衛骨肉，曾與賊惡鬥，賊眾，復擁利器，二子髫　弱齡，乃敢攖賊怒，亦早抱必死之志矣：幼女丁香，才八齡弱，申君謂其　衣幾被褫，小腹留有指抓痕，雙目哭睜，係驚悸過度致死，亦慘矣·全家七口，今孑然獨存，生亦何趣。數度自殺，為醫師護士解救，申君謂宜茍留殘喘，捐軀報國，國勝，則復仇有日去。語誠壯，惟弟痛遭此變，神志衰弱，心疾已成，何能躍馬殺賊？風聞賊已入城，與其坐以待斃，不如闖入賊營，以申君所借手槍，作孤注之擲，妻兒死而有知，必能助我多殺數賊。別矣吾兄，如佛說不妄，圖報當期諸來也。弟鼎元頓首。」</p>
<p>「唉！」四個人聽我念完這信，同聲歎息着。</p>
<p>歎息之後，我看了各人一眼，見他們的神情上都含缊着一腔怒火，一團忿恨，纔和着無限的悲切。這種感情的衝動，激蕩，把屋子裏的氛圍，造成了極度的低壓；沉默，沉默；沉默了不只三分鐘。</p>
<p>「快五點半了。」W君瞧着手錶，聲音有些沙啞。</p>
<p>「我贊成今晚突擊的計劃！」鶴見感覺神經緊張過度，有些疲倦，邊說邊揀了一張椅子，面對W君坐下，「不過…」他又沉思了一下，「不過我有一點小貢獻。從我的眼光看—當然我還沒有聽見老兄的突擊佈置—我認為雖是突擊，也不必過度冒險；過度冒險，犧牲必大。…」</p>
<p>「對得很！」W君不住的點頭。</p>
<p>「我想現在的城內和郊外，日軍的力量很厚實。根據午間的情報，國家的正規軍，十之七八，都移到長辛店以南；其餘十之二三，都被包圍，正在消耗。這，可以說明兩方面的實力情形。說得更澈底一點，我們這一部分的特務潛力，已經到了應當潛伏得更深更秘密的時期了！…」鶴見在暗示W君及其部下，自此開始，應當改為「地下工作」了。</p>
<p>「對得很！」W君表示他十分贊成鶴見的分析。我們幾個人都默然點着頭。</p>
<p>「這麽看來，突擊也沒有什麽不可以；可是更要顧慮到突擊的後果：譬如我們在突擊之後，如何善後。我生長在日本，也在日本軍隊裏混到了今年二十六七歲，知道日本軍人，尤其是現在這一帶的軍人，都是無賴的傢伙！…」</p>
<p>我們聽到這裏，不只是默許鶴見的話說得對，要不是怕破壞了這神聖的緊張，攪亂了鶴見的思想，簡直想拍手歡呼了。</p>

<h3>一篇流水帳　一九四六年　美國形形色色　長話短說</h3>
<p>— 夕拾譯自英文大美晚報</p>
<p>一九四六年美國的新聞人物是：礦工領袖路易士，前國務卿貝爾納斯，共和黨領袖塔虎脫，汽車大王小福特，劇作家奧尼爾，滑稽明星鮑伯霍勃，捧球健將德威廉士。</p>
<p>七位　新聞人物</p>
<p>路易士居於七個新聞人物這首，他的兩次領導煤礦工人大罷工，不僅影響每一個美國人的家庭，歐洲大部份的國家都受其影響。第一次大罷工是在四月，第二次大罷工是在十一月，兩次罷工都阻碍了美國的「復員」計劃，增加失業，使全國電和熱的使用不得不大大地節省。第一次罷工以聯邦政府接收煤礦而結束，第二次罷工法院判處路易士罰金一萬元，處工會罰金三百五十萬元，路易士於上訴期間命令工人復工，這兩次大罷工使路易士成為一九四六年美國的第一位新聞人物。</p>
<p>前國務卿貝爾納斯是第二位新聞人物。這一年來國際間大大小小的會議都由貝爾納斯代表美國出席。他是兩黨外交政策的發言人，華雷斯的去職更加强了貝爾納斯的威望。聯合國在倫敦和紐約所開的兩次會議，四國外長的兩次會謶，聯合國安全理事會會議，巴黎和會，貝爾納斯都居於最活躍的地位，使他成為第二位新聞人物。</p>
<p>第三位新聞人物是塔虎脫，他過去是共和黨的總統候選人，十一月間共和黨的勝利增加了他的重要性，他極可能是一九四八年共和黨的總統候選人，也極可能是美國的下一屆總統。他極力抨擊美國內政，主張政府應採取强硬的勞工政策，然而反對禁止罷工。</p>
<p>汽車大王小福特是老福特的孫兒，今年廿九歲，他的汽車廠在美國復員計劃中佔很重要的位置。他是一九四五年才開始握福特廠的大權，掌權以後曾經辭退幾個高級職員，一九四六年他的地位已極鞏固，成為美國實業界傑出的人物。</p>
<p>歐仁奧尼爾的劇本＂The　Icemen　Cometh＂寫於一九三九年，直到去年才在百老匯上演，是奧尼爾自一九三四年以來的第一個劇本，上演極為成功，滑稽劇人鮑伯霍勃和棒球健將德威廉士也是美國人所注意的新聞人物。</p>
<p>除了這些全國注意的大新聞之外，去年一年來美國還產生了許多有趣的小新聞：</p>
<p>大大小小　可笑事</p>
<p>正月裏，波玲的一個竊賊瞧見電車站上有一個老太婆挽着一個沉重飽滿的大皮包在等電車，趕忙上前大獻慇勤，要代老太婆挽皮包；等到皮包一到手，竊賊拔脚便跑，片刻間無影無踪。只是可惜他不知道皮包裏面裝着是老太婆正要拿去埋葬的一隻死狗。</p>
<p>二月裏，一個退伍兵士　到斯巴犬家鄉，想使家裏人驚奇一下，在半夜裏偷偷溜進屋內，跑進他父母的臥室，一面開電燈，面大聲喊道：「您們猜是誰來着？」床上兩個年青人把頭伸出來，咆哮着，站起身，原來是兩個陌生人，他的父母早已搬了家。</p>
<p>三月裏，支加哥一個女伶為了在一齣戲裏要在鋼琴上彈八個音符，不得不參加當地音樂師公會。加州的一個男子，為了一杯咖啡，不得不進醫院：因為咖啡太熱，他喝得太急，嗆咳了，把一副假齒震跌下來，割破了嘴唇，他吃了一驚，從椅子上跌下來，頭碰在檯角上，耳朶擦裂了一條縫。</p>
<p>四月裏，比博羅城的動物院不得不多裝許多鎭欄，因為遊園的人都喜歡用手撫弄關在籠裏的獅子。紐約州的一個惡作劇作家寄了許多信給許多人，說他自己有許多訓練過的猿猴出售，可以買來作僕役使用，居然有不少人覆信要購買。</p>
<p>五月裏，財政部要把一筆多餘的稅款廿二元還給一個水兵，一時大意，寄了一張五十五萬五千五百五十元五角五分的支票去。波士頓有兩個警察拼命追逐一個人，追了兩條街才發覺他們自己並不知道他們為什麽要追那個人，而那個被追逐的人也不知道何故被追逐。</p>
<p>六月裏，一個房東想迫他的房客遷讓，用斧頭把房子的屋頂劈開。一個乘客和電車司機吵嘴，跑到電車軌道上橫臥着肯起來。</p>
<p>七月裏，一個丈夫包了一架飛機，飛到奧里共地方，他妻子的娘家，擲下了一封用石頭繋着的信，信上說：「快點回家，許多東西待洗」。</p>
<p>鴨咬人　也是新聞</p>
<p>八月裏，有一個人被鴨咬了一口，他便帶了新聞記者去看那隻會咬人的鴨，那鴨再咬他一口。</p>
<p>九月裏，一個肉店夥計包好了一大塊鹹肉放在櫃台上，一個女太太和一個男顧客一同來搶，女太太搶着了，順手把鹹肉向那男顧客頭上重重的敲了一下，嘴裏說：＂Pleased　to　Meat　You＂！</p>
<p>十月裏，芝加哥一個樂隊銅鼓手很生氣，因為樂隊指揮發明了一種用機器敲的銅鼓，他也想盡方法，發明了一隻自動指揮棒。新傑斯州兩個越獄囚犯逃到公路上，很幸運地招呼停了一部汽車，趕快跳上去坐，可惜他們沒有注意到車上坐滿了獄卒。</p>
<p>十一月裏，一個扶着拐杖的人蹣跚地走進舊金山的一間酒吧間，喝了幾杯酒，付了錢回身就華的一個十一歲的孩子，一隻脚折斷，當他在床上亂滾的時候，竟把另外一令脚也弄斷了。</p>
<p>十二月裏，一個曼納地方的妻子訴請和她的丈夫離婚，因為她的丈夫患有慢性懶惰病，足有七年未曾起床。另外一個華盛頓地方的妻子也訴請離婚，原因是她的丈夫不許她奏流行歌曲的唱片。</p>
<p>這些新聞跟着一九四六年悄悄地逝去，其後便來了一九四七年。</p>

<p>許久未曾解決的問題，在從事研究企圖利用光綫以反抗潛艇的戰爭中，得到了新的報道。</p>
<p>在企圖尋覓抵抗德國潛艇的方法時，二個美國科學家發現在每一立方英吋的海水中存有一百五十萬個灰塵樣的微料，每個微料的直徑約有五十萬分之一英吋。這種微料能將日光反射至海面上。但是光綫反射至水面時已被濾過。水吸收了紅色及黃色的光綫，餘下的綠色，藍色與紫色的光綫，混合成靛青色的海水。</p>
<p>萬能的飛機L－13</p>
<p>軍用的通訊飛機很可以指為一種萬能的飛機。</p>
<p>裝置一種可以摺疉的翼子及可以調節的登陸輪子，它可以被一輛軍用車輛在不平的地上拖曳，或者拖上一輛貨車。用雪橇替代登陸的輪子，它可以在雪上降落。或者裝以浮子，它可以在港河的基地上發動。不用除掉推進機。它可以被另一飛機拖曳上升，像滑翔機一樣，然後再利用自己的動力。</p>
<p>它能够在二百三十尺由起飛，在每小時四十三哩半時能在二百廿七呎中着陸。全身是金屬的，機翼闊度四十尺半。它的命名是L－13.（譯自科學文摘二月號。）</p>

<p>「銷魂之夜」中，有男女主角备二人，蘇姆娜馥絲德是「歌塲魅影」的女主角露意絲亞勃之登的最新作品是「萬事如意」，男主角大衛白魯斯。我們最近在「彩鳳清歌」中見過，佛蘭支通更是大眾熱悉的人物，以他們四人來合作一部片子，成績應該不會使人失望。</p>
<p>這是一支音樂喜劇。馥絲德是以歌唱起家的，在本片中，她飾演一個咖啡館的職員，却又有着十分急切的「登台熱」。一心想上舞台，連店主的愛戀都不顧。後來她為了登台心切，竟趕往某著名戲院權威處，冒稱是她下堂妻所生的女兒，他明知是假，却又為她的美色所惑，深表愛戀，可是這位權威也有著他的愛人。眼看情人被碰，心有不甘，就設法找到了那位下堂妻，欲證明女兒是假的。偏是這下堂妻有所作用，以假作眞，那權威舊情復熾，又想重拾舊歡，可巧前者的現任丈夫又聞訊趕來。這情形就詹形複雜了。最後，自然是三對情人各成眷屬，馥絲德的登台夢也得以實現，好萊塢的影商們時常喜歡利用這一種錯綜複雜的關係，以製造笑料。這種佈置，若能運用得法，的確是可以增加不少喜劇功效的。</p>
<p>老牌滑稽裴司開登，也在本片中參加演出，一貫他的冷面作風。他飾演吃食店中的伙計，却生着一種不能「看見食品」的毛病。這裏面就可能鬧出不少笑話來了。</p>
<p>看膩了大腿表演，有一扯輕鬆的喜劇，也可以調劑一下精神。</p>

<h3>Economic Emergency Measures Plan to be Submitted to National Defense Committee Today for Discussion; Finance Minister Yu Discusses Recent Gold Rush Factors</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a dinner at his official residence at 8:00 PM on the 15th for key government officials, including Yu Yu-jen, T.V. Soong, O.K. Yui, and Wang Yun-wu, all of whom accepted the invitation. During the dinner, they discussed important economic and political issues at length, and the gathering adjourned around 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The main topics for discussion at the Supreme National Defense Committee meeting to be held at 9:00 AM on the 16th will be the election law drafted by Wang Chong-hui and emergency measures to address the current economic situation. If the election law is passed by the National Defense Committee, it will still need to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The government's drafted economic emergency measures have been finalized after two discussions by the Economic Policy Research Committee of the Central Party Headquarters on the 15th. That evening, Premier Soong presented them to Chairman Chiang for review, and they are expected to be submitted to the special session of the National Defense Committee at 4:00 PM on the 16th. Fundamental solutions will be considered at length and implemented later. The first meeting of the Economic Policy Committee was held at 10:00 AM on the 15th at the Central Party Headquarters, attended by T.V. Soong, Tai Chuan-hsien, Hsu Kan, Chen Lifu, Xiao Zheng, O.K. Yui, Liu Jianqun, He Zhonghan, Huang Yuanbin, Lou Tongsun, and Li Junlong. Chairman Chen Lifu made a comprehensive review of the gold speculation and price issues. The majority agreed that the price issue should be addressed fundamentally and not be limited to public educators or a few locations. The first meeting adjourned around 1:00 PM, and the meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, still chaired by Chen Lifu. After a two-hour meeting, a final decision was made on the economic emergency measures.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The government will stop production loans to prevent speculators from manipulating them.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Yu Hongjun attended a special session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th to report on the causes of the current gold rush and the measures the government will take to address it. He stated that various government departments have been busy drafting a comprehensive plan to stabilize the financial situation and secure the people's livelihood, to control prices and suppress speculation from both positive and negative aspects, in order to eliminate the various factors disrupting the financial situation. This plan is expected to be submitted and announced at the special session of the Supreme National Defense Committee on the 16th. He believes that the market will inevitably tend to stabilize after implementation. Yu stated that gold policies should be adapted to the times and circumstances, and that the current policy does need to be re-evaluated. The government's implementation of the gold policy aims to absorb floating capital, to restore confidence in the legal tender, and to stabilize prices. Although gold prices are not related to commodity prices, they can have some impact on people's confidence. In the past one or two years, China has used this policy to absorb a considerable amount of floating capital, but since the end of last year, a gold rush has been triggered due to the following two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Several Shanghai businesses distributed welfare funds, with each person receiving 2 to 3 million, which suddenly increased floating capital and led to a rush to buy gold.</p>
<p>(2) Rumors spread that the central bank's gold reserves were empty, but the fundamental reason was the machinations of floating capital. This is a manifestation of the overall economic problem in the financial sector. To solve it, one cannot focus solely on the financial aspect. The entire plan is being drafted by the Ministries of Finance, Food, Social Affairs, and Economics, and it can be submitted tomorrow. Yu solemnly pointed out that the central bank still holds a large amount of gold reserves, enough to meet market needs; however, the entire gold policy is under review; therefore, whether to continue to sell large quantities in the future is still under discussion. Situ Dede asked him to announce the amount of gold reserves and asked if the government had statistics on the floating capital. Yu said that the central bank's gold reserves are sufficient to meet market needs. As for the amount of floating capital, it cannot be verified because it is constantly moving. However, the government will take effective steps to limit it from concentrating in Shanghai from remote areas.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] After a resolution, Pan Xulun explained the current economic measures at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th, pointing out that if the economic situation continues to deteriorate due to the gold rush, the government will be forced to consider taking some regulatory steps to stabilize prices. During the war, the government implemented controls in the rear, which greatly contributed to the control of prices in various places. Recent events in Shanghai have also proven that controls have a good impact on prices. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is now considering how to use the existing valid regulatory laws to prevent hoarding and speculation. Pan believes that in this extraordinary economic period, tolerating excessive freedom will only worsen the situation; however, China has a vast territory and many types of materials, and regulatory work that only addresses minor issues will inevitably be ineffective.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Between Taiwan Currency and Legal Tender Changed to One to Sixty</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Office, 14th] The authorities have decided to announce within days that the new exchange rate between the Taiwan currency and the legal tender will be one to sixty yuan. Xiong Shihui told reporters.</p>
<h3>Receiving Dalian and Harbin, Awaiting Government Orders</h3>
<p>Xiong Shihui told reporters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Ganza Office, met with more than 20 reporters in the office's conference room on the 14th. He answered all the questions raised one by one. Regarding the central government's negotiations on receiving Dalian and Harbin, Xiong replied that there were no diplomatic issues regarding the two cities and there was no need to negotiate further; he was only awaiting government orders before proceeding to take over.</p>
<p>Q: The communist troops are currently harassing everywhere in the Northeast. Will there be large-scale movements?</p>
<p>A: In terms of the strength of the national army, the communist troops cannot take any action in the Northeast; however, the highest authorities hope to resolve the issue of reception through political means as much as possible.</p>
<p>Q: What is your opinion on the export of soybeans from the Northeast?</p>
<p>A: Soybeans should be exported in large quantities, but due to price fluctuations within the country, there is a huge price difference for soybeans. I hope to obtain profits from this price difference, but without stimulating other prices. Reporters continued to ask about the candidates for deputy director of the office. Has the central government made a decision? Xiong said that the central government has not yet announced it. Finally, reporters inquired about the changes to the boundaries of the nine provinces and regions in the Northeast. Xiong said that it was too early and that he intended to adjust the small, intertwined areas after all nine provinces had been taken over.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Cross the Songhua River; Qitamu Falls Again</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Office, 15th] The communist offensive north of the Songhua River has begun again. Qitamu, on the west bank of the Songhua River, was captured again yesterday by communist troops crossing the river. Using more than 20 horse-drawn carts, they looted grain and destroyed the local police station's communications equipment.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Office, 15th] On the 13th, communist troops in mixed uniforms invaded Xizhuang, Wuxuantong, ninety miles east of Jiutai.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Office, 15th] More than 30,000 communist troops are entrenched outside Huadian, with the intention of attacking the county seat.</p>
<h3>Measures for Rationing Daily Necessities; First Priority Given to Public Servants and Their Families; Students, Military Police, etc. to be Handled Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Responsible persons from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Food, and other agencies continued to meet at the Ministry of Economic Affairs at 3:00 PM on the 15th to discuss the rationing of daily necessities for public educators. After some minor revisions, the draft was fully approved. It may be submitted to the National Defense Committee on the 16th. Today's meeting was chaired by Pan Xulun, and the measures for rationing daily necessities for public servants were also discussed. It was reportedly decided that each public servant and their family can receive five dou of rice, one dan of coal, two catties of sugar, five zhang of blue cloth every six months, four catties of salt, and three catties of oil per month; if approved by the National Defense Committee, it will also be implemented from March 1st. The prices will be based on the end of December last year. Furthermore, this rationing is temporarily limited to public educators, and students and military police will be handled separately. The rationing measures for employees in production and transportation will also be studied.</p>
<h3>Marshall Hosts Reporters, Reviews China's Economic Situation, Says Currency Value Has Less Impact on Farmers</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 15th] US Secretary of State Marshall made a statement on China's economic problems at a press conference, as follows:</p>
<p>"China's currency system has long been in a dire state, and it is becoming increasingly serious. When I first came to China, the exchange rate was 1,600 legal tender to one US dollar. The situation was already extremely serious at that time, and it is even worse now.</p>
<p>When reviewing the state of China's currency system, one point is worth considering: the majority of the Chinese population are farmers, and they are not as directly affected by the currency system as the American people. The situation is extremely serious in Shanghai and Nanjing, but in rural areas, farmers cultivate and eat, and their relationship with economic difficulties does not seem to be very close."</p>
<p>A reporter asked Marshall what impact it would have on US import and export trade if China banned the circulation of US dollars. Marshall believes that opinions on this are inconsistent in all aspects, so it is difficult to make a hasty conclusion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Secretary of State Marshall announced today while hosting reporters that economic advisors at the State Department have advised him not to interfere with this matter. However, whether the US government should aid China, and if so, the nature of the aid, has not been decided. There is also no indication when aid can be implemented. Mr. Marshall just had a top-level meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is said that they discussed most of the troubled areas of the world and reported to the committee that the world situation is very dangerous. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said that Mr. Marshall's report was very informative and exciting. Mr. Marshall spoke with the committee for an hour and a half, but he did not want to announce the details.</p>
<p>US Export-Import Bank Denies Loan Rumors</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The US Export-Import Bank today denied rumors circulating among Chinese people in Shanghai that "the US government will be willing to lend 500 million early to China." A spokesman for the bank said, "As far as I know, that report from Shanghai has no basis whatsoever." In April 1946, the US Export-Import Bank allocated $500 million for possible future loans to China to aid in China's reconstruction plan. The bank is the only institution that the US government can order to lend to China. According to US political elbow officials, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, while theoretically able to lend to China, is practically unable to do so.</p>
<h3>Xu Xiangqian's Nephew, Zhang Junde, Defects</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th] Zhang Junde, a cultural and educational cadre in the Health Department of the CCP's Southern Hebei Detachment, is Xu Xiangqian's nephew. Realizing the Communist Party's conspiracy to bring disaster to the country and unwilling to be tainted, he resolutely surrendered to the government and wrote to his uncle, earnestly explaining the advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3>Report of Fang Xianjue's Capture is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] A reporter recently inquired with relevant departments of the Ministry of National Defense about the report of Fang Xianjue's capture. According to reports, this is a rumor and there is absolutely no such thing.</p>
<h3>Councilors Committee Reviews Financial and Economic Proposals; Principles Agreed Upon, to be Discussed Again Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Councilors Committee held a meeting of the Financial and Economic Proposal Review Committee at 9:00 AM on the 15th, attended by more than ten people including Fu Sinian, Qian Gonglai, Yin Shuxian, and Luo Heng. Chairman Mo Dehui announced that the committee had received a total of nine financial and economic proposals, eight of which related to gold policy and price stabilization, and one related to foreign exchange. The discussion was not completed in the morning and continued in the afternoon. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM. It is reported that after the conclusions were organized, they will be submitted to the Councilors Committee for discussion on the 17th. The main points of the two important proposals and conclusions are as follows: (1) Yin Shuxian and others requested the government to quickly dispatch impartial people to thoroughly investigate the selling price of gold and foreign exchange in order to stop the rise in prices. The method is as follows: A. Please ask the government to quickly dispatch socially impartial people or entrust this committee to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the numbers of gold and foreign exchange sales and investigate whether the central bank president, Bei Zuyi, has engaged in fraud. B. All merchants who hoard and speculate and improperly purchase large amounts of gold and foreign exchange should be punished with the death penalty for the crime of disrupting the financial system, and their property should be confiscated. C. Please ask the government to re-examine the gold policy and suspend all gold and foreign exchange trading until regulatory measures are formulated. (2) Da Pusheng and others proposed suppressing price increases. The method is as follows: A. Prohibit gold trading. B. Implement a planned economy. C. Implement the collection of property taxes to increase national revenue. D. Please ask the government to send personnel to investigate how much bureaucratic capital is operating and at the same time investigate who is manipulating the financial system to allow gold and US dollars to wreak havoc and publicize it in various newspapers. E. The gold rush has caused prices to suddenly increase by seven or eight times or more. The real situation of the people's suffering should be reported to Chairman Chiang. The main points of the conclusions obtained from the discussion are as follows: (1) Please ask the government to strictly stipulate that gold and US dollars must not be used as a medium of exchange. (2) Immediately suspend gold trading. (3) Those who use gold or foreign currency to order goods or purchase houses domestically should be punished for the crime of disrupting the financial system. (4) Foreign exchange must not be traded in the market. (5) Please ask the government to have the Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Councilors Committee jointly organize an investigation team to investigate the real situation of foreign exchange. (6) If the results of the investigation are true, they should be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Legislators Formally Recommend Government Nationalize Gold, Control Foreign Currency; Legislative Yuan to Invite Premier Soong to Attend Next Week's Meeting</h3>
<p>Many Questions on Gold Policy</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Legislative Yuan held a special meeting on the morning of the 15th to review the gold policy. President Sun Ke presided over the meeting, attended by more than 70 legislators, Yu Hongjun, and Pan Xulun. At the consultation meeting, each legislator severely criticized the government's gold policy, unanimously believing that this policy not only failed to stabilize prices but also led to an increase in the prices of all goods and should be stopped immediately. Zhou Yizhi pointed out that the method of deducting gold savings certificates was inappropriate, believing that this would cause the people to lose confidence in the government and was extremely unwise. As for the foreign exchange adjustment, it should have been implemented two months ago. Repeated delays caused overseas remittances to flee to Hong Kong. The recently implemented export subsidy policy actually harmed genuine producers. Chen Guyuan criticized the government for only helping unscrupulous capitalists to profit and for fueling bureaucratic capital. The government's previous adjustments to foreign exchange all had underlying reasons. Last Mid-Autumn Festival, because some unscrupulous merchants had difficulty obtaining festivals, they adjusted foreign exchange to help them get through the festival. As a result, the price of gold rose from 180,000 to 280,000. At this critical juncture, the government should take emergency measures to make a thorough change in its policies in order to save some vitality for the country. Wei Tingsheng said that the so-called gold policy cannot become a policy at all. Its initial intention was to stabilize prices, but the result was to lead to higher prices. It is inherently contradictory and unprecedented both domestically and internationally. He believes that the government abandoned the right path and did not start with issuing public bonds, but only focused on issuing banknotes, which led to a dead end.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Too Low, Exports Stagnant</p>
<p>At the same time, the exchange rate is so low that goods cannot be exported, and foreign goods are constantly coming in. Industry and commerce cannot survive, and the countryside is withering away. Floating capital is flocking to the market, causing such a big wave. Situ Dede believes that if the government has no statistics on the total amount of floating capital, it will be difficult to achieve results by continuing the gold policy. According to his estimate, the total amount of floating capital concentrated in Shanghai solely for gold trading is as high as 90 million. Sun Jiulu pointed out that after the implementation of this foreign exchange subsidy policy, the US dollar is equivalent to a 75% price increase, and the price of gold also rises, resulting in the current gold rush. Zhong Tianxin and others also expressed dissatisfaction with the various measures of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, believing that the Ministry only focused on raising prices and did not adopt controls. The government loudly advocated supporting private factories, but private factories could not survive, which was painful for relatives. Chen Changheng and others believed that in order to cope with this gold rush, the government was rumored to be drafting an emergency measure, which would be best if it could be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review first. The proposal of Liu Butong and others to nationalize gold and US dollars was discussed at today's meeting and it was decided to send it to the Finance and Economics Committee for review. The resignation of the nine-member committee has been approved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The 314th meeting of the Legislative Yuan continued from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM this morning, reviewing the government's financial and economic policies. President Sun Ke chaired the meeting, and Yu Hongjun and Pan Xulun were invited to attend. Yu answered many questions and left the meeting at 10:40 AM. Pan Juechang then gave an overview of the economic situation. He also answered questions about the profits of the China Textile Company and the recent situation of the Fuel Management Committee for an hour. Finally, President Sun announced that a special meeting would be held next Thursday or Friday, inviting Premier Soong to attend and report on financial and economic development facilities. Earlier, Minister Yu had conveyed to the Legislative Yuan that Mr. Soong had decided to come to the Legislative Yuan for instruction in two weeks. Legislators are collecting materials and preparing to ask questions.</p>
<p>Reasons for Two Major Proposals</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Legislators Liu Butong, Li Qingchen, Cheng Yuanzhen, Jian Guansan, Chen Haicheng, Chen Zifeng, Dai Xiujun, Huang Yunsu, and others submitted the following two proposals by temporary motion. After discussion, it was resolved to submit them to the Finance and Economics Committee for review. The original proposals are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It is recommended by this Yuan that the Supreme National Defense Committee order the Executive Yuan to close the gold market, stop gold trading, and nationalize all gold. The reasons are as follows: - Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, gold and legal tender have been completely separated. The government's use of the gold policy to reduce the amount of legal tender must be effective under the condition that currency inflation stops. Now that currency inflation cannot be stopped, the gold policy has lost its effectiveness. If this policy is continued at present, it will lose the country's useful gold and provide opportunities for wealthy classes to speculate and make money. 2 Although gold and legal tender have no associated relation at present, the rise in gold prices can still stimulate prices, but the fall in gold prices cannot make prices fall. This is the fact that these occured for several months. In recent times, the Floating capital has been causing trouble, competing to buy gold, causing the price of gold to skyrocket and prices to rise as well. If there is no gold transaction at all and other methods are used to bring Floating capital into the normal track, there will be no such phenomenon. After the gold market is closed, the government will announce a gold nationalization policy and prohibit gold exports. Those who have gold can automatically hand over the gold to the state, and the state will give it a corresponding price or government bond coupons at a corresponding price.</p>
<p>(2) It is recommended by this Yuan that the Supreme National Defense Committee order the Executive Yuan to announce that all foreign currencies should be nationalized and implement a planned foreign trade policy. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>1 The malpractice of buying and selling foreign currencies is the same as the gold policy, so it should be stopped. After nationalizing all foreign currencies at a corresponding price, foreign nationals holding foreign currencies should exchange them for legal tender at our central bank to curb speculation in domestic foreign currency trading and avoid stimulating prices.</p>
<p>2 The current method of controlling foreign exchange in our country is that exporters must sell the foreign exchange they earn to the central bank at a legal price, and importers must apply to the central bank. However, because the legal price is too low, exporters suffer too much losses, which affects export trade. Therefore, the government now has a policy of subsidizing exporters by 100%. However, regardless of the effect of this method, its impact is to make wealth more concentrated and the distribution more uneven, which is not beneficial to the country and society.</p>
<p>3 Importers can make huge profits from importing goods due to high domestic prices. Although there are restrictions on application procedures, for the purpose of profit-making, they can still smuggle or collude with application agencies to engage in fraud, which cannot be limited. Therefore, in order to eliminate malpractices, import trade should also adopt a planned system.</p>
<h3>National Army Enters Linyi Yesterday; Remnants of Communist Troops Flee in Three Routes; Nationalists Also Recovered Dingtao in Western Shandong at the Same Time</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] After four hours of fierce fighting, the National Army entered Linyi, an important town in southern Shandong, at 7:00 AM on the 15th. The remnants of the communist troops fled to Mengyin and Sishui in the northwest of the city. The National Army entering the city comforted the people while clearing the remnants of the communist troops in the city, and sent powerful troops to track and pursue them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The remnants of Liu Bocheng's communist troops continued to retreat across Dingtao towards Yuncheng. The National Army recovered Dingtao on the afternoon of the 15th and took advantage of the victory to pursue them, hoping to completely resolve them on the south bank of the Yellow River. It is said that Liu led more than 10,000 rear personnel to escape to Shouzhang on the north bank of the Yellow River three days ago.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 14th] The main force of the communist troops Xie Si and Xie Jiu divisions defending the front of Linyi began to retreat to the mountainous area southeast of Linyi on the 14th. There are no major communist troops harassing within Ganyu. Furthermore, the National Army moving south from Xinzhai entered the outskirts of Mengyin on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 14th] In central Shandong, the National Army advancing to near Aoyang Town south of Xintai was greatly reinforced by communist troops, and a part of 5,000 communist troops fled north from Mengyin, attempting to attack the flank of the National Army. Therefore, the battle in the area is still ongoing in the original area, while the outskirts of Jinan are as calm as ever.</p>
<p>National Army Enters the City; People Rejoice</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 15th] The elite troops of Li Tianxia and Zhang Lingfu, two of the five tiger generals personally cultivated by Wang Yaowu, formally recovered Linyi City at 10:00 AM on the 15th. Linyi is the base of the New Fourth Army, the second strongest force of the CCP, and also the location of the CCP's East China Bureau, the pseudo-Shandong Provincial Government, and the Shandong Military Region, that is, the CCP's military and political center north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River. Its importance to the CCP is second only to Yan'an and exceeds Jiamusi in the Northeast. It is also the Yan'an of East China. The defeat of the communist troops in Linyi is of great significance and has a serious impact, not only far exceeding the previous failures in northern Jiangsu and Zhangjiakou, but also far exceeding the failures in Siping Street and Changchun in the late spring of last year. Linyi has been occupied by communist troops for seven years. Today, when the city saw the light of day once again, the people rejoiced madly. Chen Yi led the remnants of the troops to flee in three routes to the Yimeng Mountains. One route fled from Mengyin to Sishui, one route rushed from Liangqiu to Zou County, and one route from Fei County also went to Sishui. According to his intentions, or will have a slightly rest and reorganize in the mountainous areas of southern Shandong, and then cross the Jinpu Railway to flee westward and join Liu Bocheng. Because Wang Yaowu's army group has firmly blocked the northern foot of the Yimeng Mountains, it is impossible to go north. Chen Yi's New Fourth Army originally had six basic divisions, four new divisions, three liberation divisions, and ten columns. According to official estimates, the total number of losses is 16 brigades, seven columns, and six regiments, which is about the total military force.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The center of the Beijing-Shanghai war has shifted from southern Shandong to northern Jiangsu. 100,000 communist troops are fiercely attacking Xinpu west of Haizhou. There is a major battle in the vicinity. When reporters asked the Ministry of National Defense spokesman about this, they were informed that this was completely untrue and was a communist rumor.</p>

<h3>Statement by the Democratic Socialist Party on Participation in Four Government Organizations; Total of 44 Personnel Selected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city report] Regarding the participation of the China Democratic Socialist Party in the reorganized Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Party and Government Implementation Promotion Association, and Political Council, the following statement was specially issued yesterday: Since the Party's participation in the Political Consultative Conference, it has been committed to seeking peace and democracy for China, because without peace and unity, all political facilities and financial rectification cannot be started. Later, when negotiations stalled, the government announced the date for convening the National Assembly, and the "third party" gathered in Nanjing again to seek mediation. At that time, the smoke of war filled the land, and nothing could be said about peace talks without first ceasing fire. However, once a ceasefire was involved, issues such as troop deployments and local government power would arise accordingly, thus military affairs involved political affairs, and political affairs involved military affairs again, entangled with each other endlessly; and the Chinese Communist Party did not agree to the original date for the convening of the National Assembly, nor did it negotiate another date. Under these circumstances, the government intends to end the period of political tutelage and formulate a constitution, which is a step closer to democracy. Therefore, the Party nominated candidates for the National Assembly to participate in the constitutional drafting work, in order to lay the foundation for democratic politics; when the constitution was completed, the smoke of war in the country still did not subside. The government believes that there is still considerable time before the date of constitutional implementation, and issues related to constitutional implementation, such as the formulation of election laws and other laws, are beyond the ability of the government during the period of political tutelage. It is necessary for the participation and cooperation of other parties to meet the expectations of people across the country. Therefore, it was decided to reorganize the government and firmly invite the Party to nominate participants; at this transitional period, the Party can only work with a spirit of cooperation to achieve the goal of participating in the Legislative Yuan and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, which is an inescapable duty. The duties of the Control Yuan also require some correction of the politics of the transitional period. The Political Council is an organization for collective wisdom during wartime, and various parties have long been present. Therefore, the purpose of participation is to bring politics onto the right track of democracy and the rule of law! After several discussions, the Party believes that since it participated in the constitutional drafting, participation in the preparatory work for constitutional implementation is necessary to fulfill its responsibilities. Therefore, it unanimously decided to participate in the reorganized Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, and Political Council to live up to the people's desire to gradually enter the rule of law and governance; as for bearing the responsibilities of decision-making and administration, it will wait until all parties in the country are unanimously committed to peace and democracy (February 15, 36th year).</p>
<p>[Also reported] The number of places for the Democratic Socialist Party to participate in the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Political Council, and Promotion Association was originally set at 34. Now, the number of participants in the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association has increased from 5 to 15. Therefore, the total number of participants from the Party in the four organizations has also increased to 44. According to Mr. Feng Jinbai of the Party, the list of the Party's participants in the four organizations, such as the Legislative Yuan, has been selected and finalized. Party members who should be elected far away in North China, the Americas, and other places have replied by telegram, and all participating personnel lists will be brought to Nanjing by Mr. Jiang Yuntian within days for submission to the government. As for the participating personnel, they will take office in Beijing as soon as the government announces their names.</p>
<p>[Also reported] Mr. Zhang Dongsun, Director of the Secretariat of the Democratic League, is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 19th on an American military plane to return to Yanjing University to continue teaching. His vacant position in the Democratic League will be temporarily filled by Mr. Huang Yanpei.</p>
<h3>American Journalist Delegation Arrives in Shanghai for Visit; Howard Believes the CCP Still Lacks Sincerity in Seeking Peace; The Group Scheduled to Fly to the Philippines and Return Home This Morning</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] Mr. Howard, a giant in the American newspaper industry, and nine other American newspaper leaders, at the invitation of the U.S. Army Department, toured various regions of the Pacific. Yesterday, they arrived in Shanghai by car from Beijing. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Howard and others visited Mayor Wu at 10:30 a.m. to conduct a wide-ranging review of the economic and political situation in Shanghai, and expressed their admiration for Mayor Wu's spirit of perseverance in promoting various municipal measures in difficult circumstances. At noon, Mr. Howard and others attended a luncheon hosted by the Western Journalists Association of this city at its clubhouse in the Broadway Building. In the afternoon, they attended a cocktail party hosted by U.S. Consul General Davis, where U.S. Commercial Counselor Corder, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Smith, and American Evening Post Chief Editor Gould reported on the political, economic, and security situation in China.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Howard's statement to this newspaper's reporter, the American public's opposition to the U.S. government's "softening" policy toward the Soviet Union has recently become more intense. Mr. Howard also said that the American public deeply feels that it may be very difficult to organize a coalition government in China under the current circumstances, and it is also difficult to find a reasonable solution for the transfer of Marshal Marshall. He also said that Marshal Marshall's recall to the country is a natural development in the political situation. According to Mr. Howard's personal observation, the CCP has failed to sincerely express its sincerity in the ceasefire negotiations, which has led to the stagnation of the peace talks. Chairman Chiang and the central government are often constrained by the agreements in the negotiations, which allows the CCP to take advantage of military opportunities.</p>
<p>At 8 p.m. last night, American journalists here jointly hosted a banquet at the Broadway Building to welcome and bid farewell to Mr. Howard and others.</p>
<p>Mr. Howard and others flew to Beijing from Japan the day before yesterday and met with Chairman Chiang in Beijing for an hour and a half to discuss the domestic and international situation in our country. Mr. Howard and others are scheduled to take a U.S. Army Department connecting flight to Manila at 8 a.m. this morning for sightseeing and will inspect Honolulu before returning to the United States.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders the Customs to Handle Through Navigation of the Qiantang River to the Sea; Setting up Markers to Facilitate Sea Imports and Exports</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Since the ocean liner Tang En broke through the cage gate shoals and first sailed into the Qiantang River, all parties have been very concerned about the passage of the Qiantang River waterway.

<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Xue Dubi, Chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, came to Hangzhou to inspect the seawalls and went to Haining today to inspect the key seawalls along the river. According to Mr. Xue's statement to this newspaper's reporter, the Qiantang River seawall is the second largest project in the country after the Yellow River, and it is closely related to the lives and property of the people in Jiangnan. Therefore, he urgently hopes to complete it as soon as possible. However, due to funding constraints, the implementation of the fundamental plan is still pending. If the country can be safe as soon as possible, the plan can also be realized earlier. China's construction industry needs 50 years of hard work to modernize. Currently, we can only endure and work hard. As for the transfer of the Seawall Bureau to the central government, the Executive Yuan's approval still belongs to the provincial government. However, the local financial resources are insufficient and must be subsidized by the central government. Therefore, he will go to Beijing with Pi Zuoqiong, Director of the Construction Department, tomorrow to negotiate with the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China Once Again Suffers Humiliation!</h3>
<p>The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting in London convened on the 14th to discuss whether China should be a convener of the peace conference with Germany. The representatives of Britain, the United States, and France unanimously advocated that the four major powers and China should all be conveners of the peace conference with Germany. However, the Soviet representative, Gusev, disregarded the opposition of the British, American, and French representatives, maintained his original stance, and reiterated his reason, stating: "Only the four major powers that signed the German instrument of surrender, namely Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, can be considered conveners of the peace conference with Germany." This resulted in the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting failing to reach an agreement on this matter.</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, during the final meeting of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting in New York to decide on the agenda of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes proposed inviting China to attend the next Foreign Ministers' meeting to participate in drafting the peace treaty with Germany. However, this suggestion was resolutely opposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, thus leaving the suggestion unresolved internationally. Moreover, Foreign Minister Molotov even opposed China being one of the conveners of the peace conference with Germany. The reason he gave was that the Potsdam Declaration stipulated that only countries that signed the German instrument of surrender could participate in drafting the peace treaty with Germany.</p>
<p>The reason given by the Soviet side is untenable, both legally and morally. Legally speaking, the most important provision of the Potsdam Declaration was to establish a Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Council to be responsible for negotiating peace treaties with the six enemy countries in Europe and proposing solutions to territorial issues arising from the end of the European war. It only stipulated that the drafting of the peace treaty should be carried out by member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council that had signed the instrument of surrender. Even the joint declaration of the three Foreign Ministers in Moscow stipulated that after the drafting of the peace treaty was completed, the Foreign Ministers' Council would convene a 21-nation peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaty and make recommendations. According to this, the drafting of the peace treaty should indeed be carried out by the countries that signed the instrument of surrender, but the peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaty should be convened jointly by the five member states of the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Council. Therefore, China may not participate in the drafting of the peace treaties with the six enemy countries in Europe, but the drafting of the peace treaties is only a part of the entire agenda and procedure. The entire agenda and procedure should be decided by the five member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council. In other words, the Soviet Union has reason to refuse China's participation in the drafting of the peace treaty, but it has no reason to oppose China being one of the conveners of the peace conference.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of morality, Germany was the main culprit of World War II and should be held fully responsible for the outbreak of the war. Although China, due to geographical factors, was unable to directly participate in the war against Germany, it fought alone in the Far East, engaging in a desperate struggle with Germany's ally, Japanese imperialism. In fact, it shared a very significant burden for the Allied countries fighting on the European battlefield. The Allied victory over Germany and China's containment of Japan, preventing it from supporting Germany, made a significant contribution. In particular, the Soviet Union, during the war, strategically yearned for Japan's participation in the war against the Soviet Union, so as to achieve a pincer attack from both the east and west. Assuming that Japan, without China's constraint, had declared war on the Soviet Union without any scruples, what tragic situation would have resulted for the Soviet Union under the combined attack of the two major powers of Germany and Japan? We dare not imagine it. Now, the Soviet Union has forgotten the contributions of its former allies and actually opposes China being a convener of the peace conference with Germany. This is tantamount to insulting the international status of its former allies. What is the moral justification for this?</p>
<p>Based on the above two reasons, when the Chinese government was invited to attend the London Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting at the end of last month to express its views, it sent notes to the governments of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, reiterating its consistent position and proposing two suggestions: The peace treaties with Germany and Austria should be discussed at a formal peace conference held by the relevant countries of the United Nations; all procedural issues regarding the convening of the peace conference should be discussed and decided upon in advance by all five member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council. At the same time, it explained the reason: "According to the Potsdam Agreement, the drafting of peace treaties with European enemy countries is to be carried out by member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council that have signed the instrument of surrender, but the convening of the peace conference and all procedural issues related to the organization of the peace conference should be decided upon in advance by all five member states of the Foreign Ministers' Council." The reasons provided by the Chinese government can be described as reasonable and forceful, and there is really no way to refute them. When the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed this issue on the 14th, the British and French representatives also advocated that after the drafting of the peace treaty with Germany is completed, a peace conference with Germany should be convened for discussion, and the four major powers and China should be the conveners of this peace conference. This also shows that people think alike. As long as the reasons are normal and sufficient, there is no need to fear the sophistry of others. The reasons given by the Soviet representative Gusev are still the same set of arguments that Molotov made at the New York Foreign Ministers' meeting, which are obviously unreasonable and do not need to be refuted.</p>
<p>Molotov and Gusev are both top-notch diplomats of the Soviet era. They are not only clear-headed and sharp-eyed, but also have a deep understanding of everything. Is it possible that they cannot distinguish such a simple matter? Why do they want to oppose China being one of the conveners of the peace conference? Why does Molotov dare to despise China to such an extent? These questions are worthy of our deep reflection and vigilance!</p>
<p>The foreign policy adopted by our country after the war can be considered enlightened enough. In any international conference, we have consistently adopted an impartial and detached attitude. When faced with irresolvable disputes, we often act as a mediator to resolve difficulties, and we have made countless efforts to promote international cooperation and understanding in the past year and a half. The success of previous international conferences has also benefited from the strength of the Chinese representatives. It can be said that China has fulfilled its role as a bridge between the two major international blocs. In particular, towards the Soviet Union, we have strived for its understanding and friendship. In order to gain the friendship of the Soviet Union, we have made great self-sacrifices. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance further proves China's sincerity towards the Soviet Union! But why does the Soviet Foreign Minister want to insult China's international status to such an extent? We really feel puzzled.</p>
<p>This is not the first time our country has been insulted by the Soviet Union internationally. For example, in July of last year, the Soviet Union refused China to be one of the conveners of the Paris Peace Conference. Although this also aroused resentment among the Chinese people at the time, in order to preserve the traditional friendship between China and the Soviet Union, we endured and endured, and finally managed to dilute it. At the same time, with the mediation of friendly countries such as Britain and the United States, we were able to take turns with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to serve as chairman in the Paris Peace Conference, so it did not cause a breakdown in the feelings between the two peoples. But today, the Soviet representative has relapsed into his old ways. Regardless of the Soviet Union's intentions, it will inevitably affect the friendly feelings that the 450 million Chinese people have had towards the Soviet Union for many years. For the sake of preserving the traditional friendship between China and the Soviet Union, we have to protest against Gusev's argument of disregarding the opposition of the British, American, and French representatives and insisting on his original position, even at the cost of insulting China's international status.</p>

<h3>Strictly Guard Against the Resurgence of German Aggression France and Czechoslovakia to Conclude Alliance Significance of this Move as Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting Approaches France and Poland Also to Conclude Cultural Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The French Foreign Ministry announced today that France is about to conclude alliances with Czechoslovakia and Poland. Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister Masaryk, who came to Paris to sign the treaty, had the opportunity to hold talks with the French Foreign Ministry and believed that since both governments are willing to assist in promoting European security and world recovery and prosperity, negotiations should be held immediately to implement the joint declaration of France and Czechoslovakia in August 1944. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that the new Franco-Czech treaty will reaffirm the validity of the previous treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries. The spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry also said that French Foreign Minister Bidault and Polish Foreign Minister Modzelewski have held talks on the conclusion of a Franco-Polish cultural agreement. When reporters asked the spokesman whether the French government wanted to unite with the Soviet Union in order to take concerted action at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' meeting, the spokesman solemnly stated that France had no intention of forming an axis with any country. France has no intention of forming a group to force other countries to accept its opinions on the German issue.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 14th] Regarding the upcoming negotiations between France and Czechoslovakia to conclude a treaty of alliance, French Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Dejean, commented that the simultaneous announcement by the governments of France and Czechoslovakia that they will hold negotiations to conclude a treaty of alliance is sufficient to show that both countries suffered during the war and fought for their own freedom and the freedom of the world. Now, they can still respect each other and have decided to eliminate the unfortunate page of 1939 in their history, and work together with the United Nations to develop peace and world prosperity. At the same time, Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister Masaryk issued a statement saying that the joint communique issued by the governments of France and Czechoslovakia was the result of his and Clementis's meetings with French leaders in Paris. France is Germany's western neighbor, and Czechoslovakia is Germany's eastern neighbor. Both sides will definitely express great concern over the negotiations on the German peace treaty. The political importance of the Franco-Czech joint communique lies in the fact that the German peace treaty must guarantee the control of Germany and the security of France and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Alliance Negotiations Begin British Side Seems Indifferent</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Formal negotiations for an Anglo-French alliance began today. Both sides formally exchanged drafts. The French draft was approved by the French cabinet this morning and delivered to British representative Sir Harvey by French Ambassador Massigli at the British Foreign Office this afternoon. It is generally believed that due to the few differences of opinion in the drafts proposed by both sides, there should not be any difficulties during the negotiations. The French draft seems to want to expand the alliance relationship to the military field, including the joint use of bases, the exchange of aviation personnel and equipment, etc. The British side does not seem to want to use the Anglo-French alliance treaty to replace the functions of the United Nations organization. However, some British officials believe that concluding a military alliance with France at present can better guarantee peace in Europe than the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] Britain and France exchanged draft alliance treaties today, but according to the Foreign Office, Britain seems indifferent to the treaty, at least in the part relating to Germany. The point of contention may be the Ruhr question. French political leaders asked the British side to give guarantees, and the British side believed that this was a request for the Ruhr coal mines. Britain wants to postpone the Ruhr question until after the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting before reaching an agreement. In Paris, a French government spokesman said that it would not be surprising if the Anglo-French alliance treaty were signed before the Moscow meeting next month. However, neither the British nor the French side has published the text of the treaty.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Port of Nice, France, 14th] Two British and two French destroyers escorted the British 45,000-ton battleship "Duke of York" into Villefranche Bay this afternoon.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Port of Garoupe, French West Africa, 14th] The Second Squadron of the British Home Fleet arrived here yesterday, including two cruisers and two destroyers. Fleet Commander Barker immediately visited Moroccan District Commander of the National Navy, Bayou.</p>

<h3>French Economic Difficulties Wave of Strikes Rages Premier Ramadier Says "State Affairs are Worrisome"</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] Civil servants in Paris, including the police, went on strike for four hours today, causing everything to come to a standstill. Premier Ramadier announced to the National Assembly that "state affairs are worrisome, and even the French Republic is worrisome." Transportation and communications workers, postal workers, various union officials, and other civil servants held a large-scale demonstration this afternoon, passing through the streets near the Arc de Triomphe. The procession was a mile long. The police also left their posts to join the march. Typesetting and printing workers from 32 daily newspapers in Paris had already gone on strike, so the newspapers were unable to publish. The civil servants' strike is a demonstration to achieve the demand for a monthly salary increase of 7,500 francs. The government argues that those with higher salaries cannot be increased by the same amount. Automatic telephones in Paris have stopped working, subway trains and buses are also not running, and postal and telecommunications traffic has completely stopped.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] Civil servants went on strike, including uniformed traffic police, but political and trade union figures here believe that this trend may subside. After Premier Ramadier made a strong appeal to the National Assembly, civil servants will no longer hold symbolic strikes. It is reported that the Premier has now rejected the trade union's demand for wage increases and has clarified the government's determination to continue to implement the Blum cabinet's policy of suppressing prices. At the same time, the newspaper industry strike is still continuing, waiting for the decision of the Price and Wage Commission. However, the printing workers' union is not controlled by communist forces, so its strike has no political nature.</p>
<h3>Philippine Civil War Hope for Resolution</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 15th] Peasant Army leader Taruc sent a letter to Congressman Fonacier today, asking to have it read to Congress, demanding an immediate cessation of the suppression. Once the military police stop their offensive, the Peasant Army is prepared to disband. President Roxas immediately answered the press, saying that the peasant problem cannot be solved piecemeal, and the pacification plan will continue. If Taruc wants to talk, his safety can be guaranteed. Political observers believe that with this sudden expression from both sides, there is hope for a resolution of the Philippine civil war.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Loans to Hungary</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 15th broadcast: The U.S. government announced that it will continue to lend Hungary $15 million for the purchase of surplus materials. Together with the previous loan, it now totals $30 million. The purpose is to enhance the confidence and strength of anti-communist elements in Hungary.</p>
<h3>President Drives Tram in Person, Crowd Cheers</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Mexico City, 15th] Mexican President Alemán drove a tram on a tour, which was seen by the public, but this is not a daily occurrence, only once. The President wanted to understand the tram operation in the city, so he sat on the platform of the tram and drove for 500 yards, and the crowd cheered along the way.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of State Admits World Situation is Critical Reports on Diplomacy Before Senate Committee Scheduled to Depart for Moscow at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a meeting today. Afterwards, Committee Chairman Vandenberg announced that Secretary of State Marshall had made a statement to the Foreign Relations Committee on the situations in China, South America, Palestine, and Europe. The statement was quite exciting in some respects.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Marshall said today at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the world is in an extremely critical situation. Marshall later told reporters that, in addition to revealing the previous statement, he had discussed most of the world's points of contention at the meeting, one of which was the Palestine issue. In addition, preparations for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting were also discussed. According to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, the Secretary of State has indeed gained a lot of experience in his short time in office, and his report is very encouraging.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] Marshall announced at a press conference that he will travel to Moscow by plane between March 5th and 7th to attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The selection of his advisors has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Occupation Expenses</p>
<p>As for the U.S. expenses in its occupied countries, I oppose reducing them. If the people of these countries are struggling on the brink of starvation, the U.S. will not be able to continue its current occupation work. Therefore, the State Department is directly concerned about the living conditions of the people in the countries occupied by the U.S. If we reduce expenses, it will likely affect the U.S.'s position internationally. Although the world situation is extremely critical, I am still optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Korean Issue</p>
<p>It is reported that a Soviet officer sent a letter to workers in Seoul, urging them to unite and oppose the U.S. authorities in Korea. The State Department is currently waiting for official confirmation of this news.</p>
<p>Relations with Poland</p>
<p>As for the U.S. recalling its ambassador to Poland, Lane, this does not mean that the U.S. is severing diplomatic relations with Poland. As for whether Ambassador Lane will return to his post after consulting with State Department officials, I am not in a position to say here.</p>
<p>Palestine</p>
<p>Regarding British Foreign Secretary Bevin's decision to submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations organization for handling, I am also not in a position to comment here. I believe that the relevant parties are still holding talks in London.</p>
<p>Greek Political Situation</p>
<p>Regarding the Greek issue, it is hoped that the Greek people will unite and serve the country during any period when any party has an army. The U.S. government hopes that the recent expansion of the Greek cabinet's base will symbolize that Greece has put the past behind it in order to cope with the future. It is hoped that the Greek government can issue an amnesty decree and take steps to reform its administration.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Intends to Reject Our Country's Inclusion as an Invited Country to the Peace Conference with Germany Britain, the United States, and France Reject Yugoslavia's Territorial Demands on Austria</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 14th, United Press] The Soviet Union still insists that China should not be included as one of the invited countries to the proposed German peace conference. The Soviet side stated that only countries that "signed the German surrender terms" (i.e., the four powers) may be invited countries. The French representative broke the harmony of the meeting today by refusing to consider giving Germany an opportunity to state its opinions on the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th broadcast: The foreign deputies of the United States, Britain, and France, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet deputy, rejected Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th broadcast: The Australian government today sent a memorandum to the Four-Power Deputies' Meeting, suggesting that Germany be established into a design group similar to the Far Eastern Commission, with the participation of all belligerent countries against defeated Germany. The memorandum opposes the "rapid" establishment of a German central government because Germany has not yet shown that it can implement democracy.</p>
<h3>Wallace's View Believes U.S.-Soviet Relations are Easing</h3>
<p>[National News Agency, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, 14th] This newspaper's Slovakian news correspondent in New York recently reported that former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace met with this newspaper's correspondent today and said that the current relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is not as tense as it was in the summer of last year. My previous letter to President Truman, in which I stated my views on diplomatic relations, was helpful in clarifying the situation at that time. Now, Marshal Marshall's assumption of the post of Secretary of State has greatly improved the current situation. Regarding the policy adopted by the U.S. in Germany, the U.S. envoys in Eastern European countries are now inclined to cooperate with reactionary elements. The tendency of the occupying authorities in Germany is the same. If the four powers do not change this attitude, then German industry may not be fully utilized. I advocate that the Ruhr region should be internationalized, and that other parts of Germany should be organized into free federations. I believe that isolationism has not yet disappeared.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg on U.S.-Soviet Relations ... The Soviet Union has not reciprocated the U.S.'s fairness and goodwill in diplomacy.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg gave a speech at the Michigan Chamber of Commerce today, stating that the Soviet Union has not reciprocated the U.S.'s fairness and goodwill in diplomacy. Vandenberg's statement refers to the Soviet Union's disregard for the U.S.'s request to resolve the Lend-Lease accounts.</p>
<p>Lend-Lease Accounts</p>
<p>Vandenberg also said that we are willing to wholeheartedly establish a relationship of mutual fairness and goodwill between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but we rarely fail to fulfill this obligation, while the Soviet Union does not. The value of the military equipment that the U.S. lent to the Soviet Union during the war was $11.3 billion, and we never hesitated because of its great value. But for a year, the Soviet Union has completely ignored the U.S.'s four proposals to settle the accounts. The State Department's note on the 125 merchant ships leased to the Soviet Union was also ignored by the Soviet Union. The above two are just the most obvious examples. I dare say that this kind of experience cannot promote mutual goodwill and understanding.</p>
<p>Desire for Peace</p>
<p>Vandenberg continued that the U.S. government insists that the Soviet Union quickly respond to the U.S. note, and this action cannot be regarded as an unfriendly act or a loss of dignity. The Soviet Union's desire for peace is no different from the U.S.'s desire for peace. The U.S. only seeks impartiality, and our price for peace is to deeply believe that peace under the protection of the United Nations will benefit both countries. We should wholeheartedly support the United Nations, but the U.S. must maintain complete and appropriate national defense before proving that it can maintain peace. We should sincerely cooperate with the Soviet Union to seek a universal disarmament agreement, and the Soviet Union should do the same with other countries. We cannot disarm alone, or rely solely on a piece of paper. Lessons from the past cannot be repeated.</p>
<p>Atomic Control</p>
<p>This theory also applies to the issue of atomic energy. Atomic energy itself is a threat to civilization. In the years that the U.S. has held the secret of atomic energy, we should seek an international plan to guarantee that atomic energy will never be used for destructive purposes in any place. We are currently making this effort, which is the greatest demonstration of international confidence and goodwill in the history of human relations. We will never give up the atomic secret until the day when the threat of atomic bombs can be eliminated from the entire earth, and ensure that any violator is promptly punished in some way.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers' Meeting</p>
<p>The upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers' Meeting may promote U.S.-Soviet understanding in all aspects. Regarding this point, I further hope that the Soviet Union will abide by its promise to allow U.S. newspapers to cover the news of the meeting without restriction and to provide various conveniences without restriction, which is the most convenient and wise.</p>
<h3>Su Jian Persists in Concluding a Convention, Urges the United States to Destroy Atomic Bombs, Gromyko Vigorously Criticizes the U.S. Proposal</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 14th] The Security Council held a meeting tonight, with Soviet representative Gromyko firmly advocating the conclusion of an international atomic energy convention and criticizing the plan proposed by former U.S. representative to the Atomic Energy Commission, Baruch. His remarks included that Baruch's plan, which stipulated the establishment of an atomic energy agency independent of the General Disarmament Commission, was undesirable. If the five permanent members of the Security Council were to relinquish their veto power over the Atomic Energy Control Commission, it would undermine the foundation of the United Nations. The Atomic Energy Commission has yet to reach a consensus on recommendations for the control of atomic energy. The Commission has failed to comply with the United Nations Charter and the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly on the conclusion of an international atomic energy convention. The conclusion of an international atomic energy convention would facilitate the work of the United Nations. However, the United States insists on Baruch's plan, preventing the convention from being established. The conclusion of an international atomic energy convention does not interfere with the atomic energy control system. In essence, the United States is currently using the continued manufacture of atomic bombs as a means of exerting pressure on other countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Soviet representative Gromyko today severely criticized the United States in the Security Council for continuing to manufacture weapons of mass destruction, and stated that atomic energy is still being exclusively used for the manufacture of weapons, which are fundamentally weapons of aggression. U.S. representative Austin referred to Gromyko's remarks as a "minority report" and said that he would reserve his comments until he had reviewed Gromyko's amendment. Gromyko stated that the revision of the U.S. proposal could proceed, but atomic bombs themselves must be destroyed before any control is truly established.</p>
<h3>Two Sisters in South Africa Transform into Men</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cape Town, South Africa, 15th] Two sisters here, aged seventeen and fifteen, have recently undergone surgery and have become two brothers. The two sisters initially regretted not being born as boys and were overjoyed that their dream had come true. The medical community here has shown great interest in this surgery.</p>
<h3>The Palestine Problem Cannot Be Resolved; Britain Decides to Submit It to United Nations Bodies</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Foreign Secretary Bevin admitted today that Britain's long-term efforts to get Jews and Arabs to accept a compromise have failed. Palestine has been a thorn in Britain's side since the time of General Allenby. Approximately 100,000 British troops will continue to be engaged in security and be governed by the current government until a decision is made by United Nations bodies. However, Britain is now eager to resolve this issue. According to a Foreign Office spokesperson, the British government may ask the Security Council to convene a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the situation in Palestine. Although Britain has drafted an independence plan for Burma and withdrawn troops stationed in Egypt, it has not yet clearly indicated whether it is willing to propose a permanent withdrawal from Palestine. Whether the British government will submit a special plan for resolving the Palestine problem to United Nations bodies, or simply hand over all proposed plans to United Nations bodies without attaching additional recommendations, will be announced in the House of Commons next Monday.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of the British Coal Shortage Seems to Have Taken a Turn for the Better</h3>
<p>Attlee Declines to Accept Aid from the U.S.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] London, 15th Broadcast: Hundreds of thousands of British miners and railway workers today voluntarily declared their willingness to transport coal for power and gas plants on holidays.

Prime Minister Attlee today discussed with the nine-member emergency committee the date for the partial restoration of electricity supply. U.S. President Truman offered to provide coal on American ships to Britain, but Attlee politely declined. He replied to Truman that the European continent needs coal just as urgently as Britain, and we cannot divert coal intended for Europe to Britain. The number of unemployed people in Britain has exceeded five million.</p>

At the same time, it also followed the proposal of Representative Norcen, chairman of the House Budget Committee, to reduce personal income tax by 20%.</p>
<h3>British Defense Budget</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Defense Minister Alexander released a white paper today estimating that the British armed forces will need 1,087,000 male and female soldiers in 1948, unless the international situation improves, subject to further consideration. At the end of last year, the number of troops totaled 1,427,000. Alexander estimates the total defense expenditure budget for the 1947-48 fiscal year at £899 million, subject to change due to changes in accounting methods.</p>

<h3>Manipulating Gold Prices Added to Blacklist; Evidence Collection to Ensure Severe Punishment; Personnel Decisions Made for the Supervisory Team; Hundreds of Military Police and Police Officers Assigned to Conduct a Comprehensive Survey of Trading Venues Throughout the City</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] It is reported that, regarding the cause of this surge in gold prices, the military and police authorities, with the assistance of an economic expert and renowned accountant, have been investigating the accounts of banks and gold firms for several days. Initial research has concluded that the Central Bank's cessation of covert sales was a significant factor contributing to speculation.</p>
<p>Manipulating Gold Prices Added to Blacklist; Evidence Collection to Ensure Severe Punishment; Personnel Decisions Made for the Supervisory Team; Hundreds of Military Police and Police Officers Assigned to Conduct a Comprehensive Survey of Trading Venues Throughout the City</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Several days before the establishment of the economic reconnaissance network, the Garrison Command had already begun investigating the gold surge case, and it has now reached a stage. It is reported that after February 1st, eight or nine out of ten of the gold sold by the Central Bank were purchased by unscrupulous merchants who manipulated gold prices and monopolized the market. The authorities have prepared a blacklist of unscrupulous merchants suspected of manipulating gold and are expected to take action starting today. Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the Military Intelligence Bureau, was ordered by Chairman Chiang to come to Shanghai to join Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu in organizing an economic supervisory team and implementing emergency measures. Since yesterday, hundreds of military police and police officers have been assigned to conduct a comprehensive survey of trading venues throughout the city, including banks, gold firms, rice shops, and stock markets, and to investigate and monitor individuals suspected of manipulation, preparing to take action at any time when concrete evidence is obtained. At 2 PM yesterday, senior military and political officials gathered again at Zheng Jiemin's residence to discuss personnel decisions for the economic supervisory team. It was decided that Commander Xuan would concurrently serve as the head of the team, with five members: Fang Zhichao, Director of the Administrative Department of the Police Bureau; Tao Yishan, Director of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command; Wang Xinheng, Counselor of the Municipal Government; Wu Guangyun, Commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police; and Ji Yuanpu of the China Textile Corporation, responsible for planning and directing. A secretariat was established, with Li Zheng as the Chief Secretary, and Jiang Songping, Xu Youzuo, Zhang Yamin, and Wang Zhongqing as Secretaries. As for the three groups established: (1) Gold and Currency Investigation Group, concurrently headed by Xu Youzuo; (2) Food Investigation Group, concurrently headed by Wang Zhongqing; (3) Yarn and Cloth Investigation Group, concurrently headed by Zhang Yamin.</p>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, the "Economic Reconnaissance Network" organization methods were discussed, and it was unanimously decided to formally establish it starting today. The reconnaissance methods will initially thoroughly investigate gold trading accounts after February 1st, and the second step will be to investigate the reasons for the disruption of the rice and silk market and thoroughly investigate the main reasons for the surge in yarn and cloth prices. Once verified, they will be brought to justice.</p>
<p>Emergency Measures Submitted to Chairman for Review</p>
<p>Commander Xuan received reporters from various newspapers at the Garrison Command yesterday and stated: "The organization and personnel of the economic supervisory team were decided in consultation with the relevant leaders at 2 PM today, and emergency measures were passed. These measures are scheduled to be handed over to the Adjutant's Office of this headquarters tonight and sent to Nanjing for the Chairman to review. The contents will not be made public until the Chairman approves them. However, the economic supervisory team will continue to conduct inspections of gold, currency, food, and cloth as usual." Xuan also stated: "Regarding the punishment of unscrupulous businesses or individuals, there are also explicit provisions in the emergency measures. Any illegal businesses or individuals who are found to have evidence will be publicly announced, and they will be tried by a military court and severely punished. Chairman Chiang ordered that the names of illegal shops or individuals who stirred up trouble and created price increases must be investigated. This team has already obtained a partial blacklist and is currently collecting evidence and conducting further investigations. Once verified, they will be severely punished without leniency." Xuan hopes that people in all circles will vigorously report any illegal businesses or individuals. If reporting by letter, it can be directly submitted to the Economic Supervisory Team within the Songhu Garrison Command. If reporting verbally, one can go to the Secretariat of the team at the Garrison Command to report. Today is Sunday, and tomorrow the various groups of this team will formally implement various inspections.</p>
<h3>Attending the Joint Meeting of the Social and Finance Committees to Discuss the Gold Surge and Commodity Prices; Summarizing Six Conclusions; Speaker Pan Goes to the Capital to Present Them to the Authorities</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Social and Finance Committees of the Municipal Council held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon, chaired by Deputy Speaker Xu, to discuss suppressing commodity prices and curbing the gold and currency frenzy. Speaker Pan rushed back from the capital to preside over the meeting and took the night train back to the capital to attend the National Defense Conference. The Speaker reported on the discussions regarding the gold and commodity price case in the capital and stated that the central government believes that the recent gold surge and soaring commodity prices in the city are major issues that require careful study. Therefore, although there are currently no specific indications, there will definitely be important measures taken.</p>
<p>Regarding gold, the Speaker specifically reported that Chairman Chiang had inquired about the types of institutions operating gold trading in Shanghai. Subsequently, Councilors Luo Qinghua and Xu Yongzuo provided opinions that the Speaker would convey to the central government. The joint meeting discussed for three hours, and finally, Luo Qinghua, Xu Yongzuo, and Yan E'sheng summarized and published the opinions of the Municipal Council on this case as follows (these opinions are also requested to be taken to the capital by Speaker Pan to contribute to the government authorities): (1) Although there are multiple reasons for the recent gold and currency surge, it is undeniable that there has been poor planning. Combined with the pushing and assistance of speculators and manipulators, it has become an unstoppable trend. Now that the central government has decided to investigate, it is hoped that it can be done vigorously and thoroughly, ensuring that no one is wrongly accused or let off, and focusing on the main points without causing undue harassment. (2) The central government should reconsider and carefully decide on the gold policy to avoid causing public anxiety due to rumors. At the same time, there should also be appropriate measures taken for U.S. dollars. (3) The soaring commodity prices are purely affected by the fluctuations of the gold and currency frenzy. There is no real reason for the price increases, which is further confirmed by the fact that commodity prices in other cities are lower than in Shanghai. Moreover, the purchasing power of citizens is weak, and interest rates are high. If prices are raised for hoarding and speculation, there will be adverse consequences. It is hoped that people in the business community will understand this point and not follow the trend blindly, causing trouble for themselves. It is also hoped that citizens will remain calm and not engage in competitive purchasing, so that after the storm passes, commodity prices will stabilize. (4) Controlling commodity prices is an urgent measure that is essential for the current situation. However, there must be thorough consideration and detailed planning in advance, supported by a strong and effective organization, in order to achieve results and avoid repeating past failures. (5) The rationing system should be endorsed in principle. However, it is hoped that the government can grasp sufficient materials so that there can be sufficient and timely rationing when implemented to meet the daily necessities of life. If it is decided to implement it in Beijing and Shanghai first, starting with civil servants, educators, and industrial workers, and then extending it to all citizens, it will surely stabilize public sentiment and enhance its effectiveness. (6) Controlling commodity prices and implementing rationing are methods of distributing materials, but the fundamental problem lies in increasing production and enriching materials. Therefore, promoting and assisting production enterprises is still a top priority. It is rumored that the recent surge in gold prices was caused by those who obtained production loans last year purchasing gold. This is not true. It is hoped that the government will still adhere to its original intention of assisting production enterprises, estimating the quantity and value of materials that factories can produce as the basis for issuing loans, so that production can be increased, the supply of materials will be sufficient, and commodity prices will naturally stabilize.</p>
<h3>Standard Prices for Gold and Rice Decided Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] It is reported that the goals of suppressing gold and commodity prices were decided in principle at the meeting at Zheng Jiemin's residence yesterday. The gold price must return to the 5 million yuan level per tael, and the rice price must return to below 80,000 yuan per dan. Other stocks, yarn, cloth, and daily necessities should shrink back in proportion to the decline in gold prices. If rice merchants hide rice or refuse to sell, their licenses will be revoked; if necessary, the government will sell directly. There is absolutely no shortage of rice in the city, and it is estimated that it can last until September of this year.</p>
<h3>Zheng Jiemin Goes to the Central Bank to Investigate Accounts</h3>
<p>General Zheng Jiemin began a thorough investigation yesterday. Yesterday morning, he went to the Central Bank to investigate gold trading accounts after February 1st. Bureau Chief Lin Fengbao reported on the gold surge. Later, because Bei Zuyi was in the capital and had not yet returned to Shanghai, Lin was unable to fully disclose the details. Therefore, the thorough investigation work will have to wait until Bei returns to Shanghai. The General has now decided to stay in Shanghai and will not return to the capital for the time being within five days.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday, Administrative Chief Fang of the Police Bureau, Section Chief Xu, Inspection Chief Tao of the Garrison Command, and Team Leader Qi also personally checked the quantity of gold allocated and selected cadres to go to inspect account books to investigate the real names of those hoarding and manipulating.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday, the stock market saw another surge. The responsible authorities are closely monitoring the situation and will take effective measures.</p>
<h3>Peace Movement Responds in Various Places</h3>
<p>After the declaration of the peace movement was published, various places have automatically responded, and it seems that it will become a nationwide movement. It is learned that the initiators of the movement are actively promoting this movement and have temporarily set up an office at Room 1, No. 96, Pei'en Apartments at the intersection of Xing'an Road and Lu'ban Road. Wang Xiaolai, Wu Kexu, Li Denghui, Hu Egong, and Chen Tingrui have been appointed as conveners.

Currently, more than 100 people have joined the movement's initiators, all of whom are well-known figures in the business, industry, education, and science sectors. Moreover, people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon are very enthusiastic about the peace movement. In addition to the business community of Kowloon previously sending a telegram to the whole country expressing their support, Lan Zhiqi and others from the business community of Hong Kong also sent a letter to Wang Xiaolai yesterday, expressing their determination to do their utmost to contact people in Hong Kong to respond to this movement.</p>

<h3>Nanshi Experiences Daytime Power Outages; Inquiring About Reasons and Seeking Improvement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Nanshi China Merchants Electric Company's daytime power outages have caused dissatisfaction among manufacturers in the area.

Moreover, the company has been approved by the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate two 2,000-kilowatt generators, which are currently on their way to Shanghai, and has purchased a 2,500-kilowatt generator from Longhua Cement Plant, all of which can be self-generated by June.</p>
<h3>The Last Batch of Amnesty; 19 Prisoners Released</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Shanghai Prison continued to release 19 prisoners yesterday who were eligible for the amnesty. From January 18th to yesterday, the prison has released a total of 1,500 people in 13 batches. These 19 people are the last batch to be granted freedom.

<h3>4th Drama Festival Held Celebration Meeting; Awarded Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Prizes; 20 People Win Prizes for Improving Peking Opera</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The celebration meeting for the 4th Drama Festival was held at the Golden Grand Theater yesterday morning at 10 AM, with more than 400 people in attendance. Chairman Xiong Foxi gave a speech, stating that the significance of the Drama Festival is self-criticism, self-examination, looking to the future, and uniting playwrights. We should accept the advantages of various forms of drama and create new art. Six speakers then gave speeches. Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, suggested: (1) Filming the beautiful movements of various dramas for everyone to appreciate and learn. (2) Next year's Drama Festival can hold a Southeast Drama Exhibition and extend the time for observation performances. Liang Yiming, representative of the Actors' Association, hopes that both the main actors and supporting actors of Peking Opera can fulfill their responsibilities. Dong Tianming of the Entertainment Association requested that all sectors support and promote local dramas and strive for the status of playwrights. Zhang Daofan elaborated on the history and significance of the Drama Festival and stated that drama is a comprehensive art and should seek mutual assistance, cooperation, mutual learning, and further development. Zhang also revealed that Chairman Chiang's criticism of Peking Opera is that cooperation is not good and supporting actors are too poor. Tian Han expressed his opinion: First, we must unite; second, we must be prepared; third, we must have courage.</p>
<p>The last speaker was Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee, who expressed two opinions: (1) The "Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Prizes" were donated by Peking Opera artists who performed at last year's Chairman's birthday celebration. It is hoped that other art departments, such as fine arts, sculpture, and music, can also hold "Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Prizes." (2) Various dramas are for the people. Peking Opera was originally performed in temples and squares for public entertainment. It only developed into a court drama during the Qing Dynasty, enjoyed by a few. Today's trend should still be for the public to enjoy and for the people to be entertained.</p>
<p>Pan Zinong then read the declaration, presenting six demands and appeals from playwrights. Pan Gongzhan then presided over the awarding of the "Chiang Kai-shek Cultural Prizes" for improving Peking Opera. In addition to 20 people, including Zhou Xinfang and Cheng Yanqiu, winning awards, Mei Lanfang also received a flag of "Lofty Character and Integrity" for upholding righteousness and maintaining his integrity, even though he did not participate in the improvement of Peking Opera performances. The commemorative meeting ended at 12 noon.</p>
<p>[Another Report] From 2 to 5 PM yesterday, the Municipal Experimental Drama School held a Drama Festival celebration reception. Zhang Daofan and Gu Yuxiu gave speeches, and a drama literature exhibition was held.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu and Chief Fang's Statements: Refuting the "February 9th Incident Support Association's" Distorted Account</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Since the incident at the Quangong Building, all sectors of this city have paid close attention. Mayor Wu has repeatedly stated that the instigators and murderers must be severely punished. However, yesterday, the Wenhui Bao published an article titled "The February 9th Incident Support Association Refutes the Statements of Wu Guozhen and Fang Zhi," which contains many inaccuracies and is filled with wanton slander, suggesting ulterior motives. After reading it, Mayor Wu not only ordered the association to correct it but also issued a statement to reporters, strongly refuting it. The key points of the statement are as follows: (1) The meeting notice only used the name "Committee for Loving National Goods and Resisting American Goods," mimeographed and distributed to various industry unions. Why did it not specify the address or the person in charge? Was this intentional ambiguity to prepare for fabricating an incident and shirking responsibility? (2) According to the laws or customs of various democratic countries, such as the Soviet Union, public gatherings must first be approved by the government. In countries like Britain and the United States, the police authorities must be notified. According to our country's laws, people's organizations must also register with the Social Affairs Bureau. Why did this association neither register according to the law nor notify the police局 when holding the meeting? Did the organizers of this association believe they were above the laws of any democratic country, or were they deliberately creating an incident and unwilling to let the police know in advance? (3) The meeting notice clearly stated, "In order to promote national goods and save the industrial and commercial crisis." It did not state, "In order to promote national goods and resist American goods." It was issued to various industry unions, inviting them to "attend and provide guidance." However, according to reports from attendees from various industry unions, only songs like "The American soldiers won't leave, we are not happy" were sung, which had nothing to do with "promoting national goods and saving the industrial and commercial crisis." Was the notice intentionally deceiving various industry unions to encourage them to participate, while the meeting deliberately strayed from the topic, attempting to hijack the venue and incite anti-American sentiment? (4) How was the presidium of the meeting elected? In principle, the agenda should have focused on promoting national goods and saving the industrial and commercial crisis. Why was the agenda not like that at the time? Since various industry unions were invited to participate, why was their consent not sought regarding the presidium and the agenda? Is this kind of method democratic? Was it a deliberate attempt by a few people to control the meeting? (5) The meeting was neither notified to the police nor conducted according to its stated purpose. Some of the attendees were obviously deceived into attending (this point has been stated to the city government by representatives of various industry unions). Therefore, the responsibility for the disturbance of order and the loss of life should legally and reasonably be borne by the convener and the organizer of the meeting. (6) The deceived representatives of various industry unions have already petitioned the city government to thoroughly investigate the instigators and murderers. Moreover, the innocent Liang Renda was tragically killed, and many others were injured. Should the government thoroughly investigate and pursue the matter? (7) Furthermore, the so-called "February 9th Incident Support Association" that published documents in the Wenhui Bao, according to the Wenhui Bao, did not specify the address or the person in charge. Are the organizers of this association again following the methods of the so-called "Committee for Loving National Goods and Resisting American Goods," deliberately confusing black and white, inciting discord, and attempting to create an incident again?</p>
<p>Chief Fang of the City Party Headquarters issued a statement, the full text of which is as follows: "After reading the article in the Wenhui Bao on the 15th, entitled 'The February 9th Incident Support Association Refutes the Statements of Mayor Wu and Myself,' I find the language evasive, full of戾氣, and intentionally煽动蛊惑. At a time when the Communist bandits are endangering the country, Shanghai is the center of the nation. The security of the nation depends on the authorities and the people making painstaking efforts to govern, while those who sow discord are attempting to increase social unrest to achieve their political ends. This kind of statement is not worth answering. However, the tragic death of Mr. Liang and the loss of a young man to the nation, adding a widow to society, is extremely painful. Who did this? Who caused this? Right and wrong are self-evident, and justice will prevail. Why use sophistry? The organization of the so-called 'February 9th Incident Support Association' has no legal entities participating, and it is unknown whether it is a political group in operation. If it is to sympathize with Mr. Liang and seek redress on his behalf, then this kind of organization must first respect the stance of the citizens and not be used for political struggles. Secondly, it must respect the dignity of the law and not mix subjective opinions. Today, as China moves towards democracy, people have freedom of assembly and association, and all political parties can operate openly, which is far from comparable to the blockade in the 'Liberated Areas' of the Communist Party. I would like to reiterate my opinion on this case as a response: (1) Freedom of assembly is a fundamental principle of democracy, and Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that it cannot be deprived by anyone or interfered with by any agency. Advocating for the national goods movement can be done through open gatherings. However, the venue was changed three times, and there was no presidium or chairman (as reported in the newspapers). What is the intention behind such mysterious democracy and freedom? (2) Article 55, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on Violation of Police Regulations stipulates that gatherings must be notified to the police局. This has been the practice in this city for many years, as it is in European and American democratic countries. How could the participants of the meeting not know this? Now, instead of blaming the convener for not notifying the police, they blame the government for failing to fulfill its responsibilities. There is nothing more颠倒是非 than this. (3) Mr. Liang participated in the meeting to promote national goods and was injured and died in a brawl among the attendees. This must be heartbreaking for the convener of the meeting. However, who is this convener? Who is the instigator of this tragedy? And who is the murderer? The government has the responsibility to protect the people and should thoroughly investigate. The judiciary has the responsibility to protect human rights and should punish the murderers according to the law. (4) Since the Liang case has been transferred to the court, everything should be left to the court to handle. Those who speak of freedom must respect the law, and those who talk about democracy must respect discipline. Those who borrow freedom are not democratic, and those who undermine discipline are not what those who advocate democracy should do. The above are my candid views and sincere advice. I have said everything I need to say and will not respond further."</p>

Over 400 people attended, including the commanders and deputy commanders of each brigade, military police, and police officers. Commander Xuan personally attended and delivered a speech, explaining the significance of the establishment of the inspection brigade, which lies in unifying powers and responsibilities, avoiding duplication of work, strengthening security, and avoiding harassing law-abiding citizens. The targets of inspection should be limited to those related to security, such as suspected bandits and villains who disrupt social order. As for men and women sharing a room in hotels, unless there is a suspicion of affecting security, it is not within the scope of inspection. The demeanor of inspection should be polite, peaceful, and thorough. Before a crime is proven, they cannot be treated as criminals.

<h3>Conspiracy to Murder Husband: Two Criminals Sentenced to Death; Nodded and Smiled Upon Seeing Each Other, Stunned Upon Hearing the Verdict</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The case of Gu Chengcuiyun, a female worker at Xin Shen Textile Factory, and her lover, Xu Meifang, jointly plotting to murder Gu Yucai, the husband, has been concluded after a trial by the District Court. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the verdict was pronounced, sentencing the defendants Cheng Cuiyun and Xu Meifang to death and depriving them of their civil rights for life.</p>
<p>After Judge Wu Shaochang took the stand, he brought up the two defendants, the adulterer and adulteress. They nodded and smiled at each other in court, unaware that their end was near. They were stunned upon hearing the verdict. The court explained the reasons for the verdict, stating that the victim was lured to Shanghai by Cheng Cuiyun, and Cheng and Xu had committed adultery. Both points had been admitted by the defendants themselves. Gu Yucai was strangled to death before his death, which had been verified by the prosecutor, leaving no room for sophistry. Xu Meifang admitted to committing the crime but claimed that Cheng Cuiyun did not know about it beforehand, obviously intending to absolve Cheng of guilt. After repeated interrogation, it was clear that the two defendants had jointly premeditated the murder, so the judgment was made as above.</p>

She claimed that the house was her private property and had nothing to do with Shao Shijun, requesting the seal to be lifted and returned. Yesterday's judgment: In accordance with Article 234 of the Civil Procedure Law, without oral argument, a preliminary ruling was made, dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit, and the plaintiff was to bear the costs of the litigation.</p>

<h3>The Eighth Approval of Qingxia Relief Fund for Nine People (Part 1)</h3>
<p>There were a total of fourteen applicants for the eighth Qingxia Relief Fund for orphans, widows, and the poor and sick. Among them, excluding those residing outside the city and those with incomplete procedures, seven people were approved, and assistance funds were appropriately granted. All of these applicants are in difficult situations, and their letters are full of blood and tears, making them unbearable to read. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chen Peisheng wrote: "There is a resident of this neighborhood, Chen Shunfu, who is over seventy years old, with no relatives or friends and no one to support him. All his property before the war was destroyed by artillery fire. He now lives under broken walls and relies entirely on the assistance of his neighbors for survival. With prices soaring, he is extremely distressed and worried about the future. I am applying for relief on his behalf. Can you appropriately grant assistance?" (Approved 100,000 yuan)</p>
<p>(2) Chen Wei wrote: "My husband used to be a military officer and died of overwork in your hospital, leaving behind me and three children. I rely on washing clothes for a living, but the cost of living has risen so much that it is difficult to maintain. I am being forced by hunger and cold and can only wait to die. I am now presumptuously writing to apply for relief." (Approved 100,000 yuan)</p>
<p>(3) Huang Zihe wrote: "I am a teacher, 53 years old this year, with a son who is only eleven years old and a daughter who is fourteen years old, all of whom depend on me to survive. I have been unemployed due to illness since 1944, barely surviving and living in a state of sorrow. Recently, due to malnutrition, my illness has worsened, and the future is bleak. A family of several people can only wait to die. I know that your organization helps the hidden poor. Can you please grant me a little assistance?" (Approved 100,000 yuan)</p>
<h3>Reader Consultation: Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Excessive Phlegm and Head Distension</p>
<p>Sun Yongzu asked: "Every morning after waking up, I must spit out a mouthful of phlegm, which is white and sometimes yellow, and very sticky. I often feel head distension when working, and I have a slight fever at night. I don't know if it is bronchitis or tuberculosis. What medications should I use for treatment? Is it related to smoking? Is the Taiwanese lung medication 'Sheta Pulmonary Stabilizer' effective?"</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming's Answer] "To determine whether your illness is bronchitis or early-stage tuberculosis, an X-ray examination is recommended for differentiation. It is best to avoid smoking. Use expectorants and antitussives, and supplement with calcium tablets and cod liver oil for nourishment. The new Taiwanese drug 'Sheta Pulmonary Stabilizer' is currently being tested, and its effectiveness is unknown."</p>
<p>(2) Intestinal Roundworms</p>
<p>You Peinan asked: "I suddenly found a dead roundworm, about a foot long, in my stool a month ago. Recently, I have been suffering from constipation and abdominal pain. Is this related to roundworms? How should I treat it?"</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming's Answer] "Roundworms can absorb nutrients from the human body, causing a pale complexion, emaciation, and physical weakness. The treatment method is to use Santonin dewormer. The cause is often eating raw and cold foods."</p>

<h3>Situation of Our Students Studying in Britain and France Qu Zixiu Recently Told Reporters</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Qu Zixiu, a specialist from the Ministry of Education who previously attended the United Nations Educational Conference, recently spoke to reporters about the situation of universities in Britain and France and the situation of our students studying abroad:</p>
<p>There are currently 400 Chinese students studying in the UK, including 25 Gengkuan students and more than 66 students who have received scholarships in the country. There are about 16 universities in the UK, emphasizing quality over quantity. The most famous Oxford and Cambridge universities are of a higher standard than universities in other countries around the world. They adopt a tutorial system and are divided into more than 30 colleges. Students do not attend classes regularly. Tutors assign topics, and students study on their own, have a conversation once a week, submit a paper for each subject, and occasionally invite celebrities to give lectures, which students must attend. Each student must live on campus for at least two years. Management is strict, and drinking and dancing are prohibited. After graduation, continuing studies for four years will result in a master's degree. The British Library has 60,000 volumes of Chinese books, mostly rare copies of the historical records of the Qing Dynasty. The museum houses 3,000-year-old Chinese bronze tripods and three jade decorations from the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>There are currently 122 Chinese students in France, studying medicine, agriculture, law, art, physics, music, statistics, literature, business, philosophy, chemistry, geology, religion, mathematics, electrical engineering, civil engineering, aviation, electrical engineering, mining, and ethnology. Most are concentrated in Paris and Lyon, obtaining doctoral and other degrees. During the war, the Ministry of Education provided relief, at 2,500 francs per student. Currently, there are still 70 self-funded students receiving relief. New students at the Sino-French University in Lyon receive 750 francs per person, and currently 10 people are being subsidized. Old students receive 400 francs per person, and currently 20 people are being subsidized. This time, the children of overseas Chinese in France, who did not have instructors in the tutorial classes, were subsidized 6,000 francs per person. According to the instructions of the Ministry of Education, students who have studied abroad for four years or conducted research for two years should return to China to serve. The Ministry of Education has notified embassies abroad to provide free or subsidized assistance to encourage students to return to China. Students have three concerns: (1) They aspire to pursue further research and study; (2) They are in debt and find it difficult to leave; (3) They are isolated from the domestic situation and are afraid that they will not be able to find employment upon their return, so many are unwilling to return to China.</p>
<p>French university faculty must serve for two years after graduating from university before being allowed to take the exam. They are first assigned to teach in middle schools, and then promoted to assistant teachers and lecturers in smaller universities, gradually becoming professors in larger universities. Teachers' salaries range from 9,000 to 12,000 francs, with an additional one-third for married individuals and a salary increase for those with children. The highest salary for professors is 80,000 to 120,000 francs. 120 francs is equal to one U.S. dollar. The heads of each department are publicly elected by the professors' association. There are more than 20 universities in France, with Paris being first-class, Lyon and Bahrain being second-class, and Lansnow being third-class.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Hold Summer Overseas Chinese Teacher Training Courses Recruit 200 Students Divided into Middle School and Elementary School Groups</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] In the summer of the 34th year of the Republic, just after the end of the European War, when the Allied forces were fully engaged in the war against Japan and the recovery of Southeast Asia was imminent, the Ministry of Education, in order to cooperate with the victory and develop overseas Chinese education, specially held the first session of the Overseas Chinese Teacher Training Course in Qingmuguan, Chongqing, recruiting ambitious young people, giving them short-term training, and sending them to serve in overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools in Southeast Asia after the recovery of Southeast Asia. After the training was completed, just when China won the War of Resistance, most of the more than 80 graduates of the association were sent to work overseas last year, with excellent results. However, recently, overseas Chinese schools have been restored and new schools have been established one after another, and the need for teachers is even more urgent. Although there are the First and Second Overseas Chinese Normal Schools in China, there is currently no suitable institution to train overseas Chinese middle school teachers. In view of this, the Ministry of Education plans to hold the second session of the Overseas Chinese Teacher Training Course to continue to reserve teachers for overseas Chinese schools to meet the needs. It is reported that 200 students will be recruited this time, still divided into middle school teacher group and elementary school teacher group. In addition to public recruitment, various ministries and commissions of the central government and normal colleges can also recommend them. The training period is two months, and accommodation and expenses for handouts and writing materials are provided. After the training period is over, those who pass the examination will be issued certificates, and they can be introduced by the Ministry of Education to serve in overseas Chinese schools in various places overseas at any time. It is learned that the Ministry of Education plans to use the summer vacation to hold this kind of training course, so that teachers from various schools can participate, and a special commissioner has been designated to be responsible for the preparations.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Solicits Bids for School Desks and Chairs Wang Qichang Factory Refused to Bid Submits a Petition to the Municipal Council to Order an Investigation into the Truth</h3>
<p>The Property Section of the Municipal Education Bureau has recently solicited bids for the manufacture of school desks and chairs, and there has been a situation of selfishness and unfairness that is inconsistent. The Municipal Council has received a petition from Wang Qichang Wood Factory and Shanghai School Equipment Company, requesting an investigation into the truth. The original petition from Wang Qichang Wood Factory stated: "This time, the Education Bureau is soliciting bids for the manufacture of 10,000 sets of school desks and chairs. The company believes that it is fully qualified to bid, so it prepared the procedures and paid a bid bond of 1 million legal tender to register. The Education Bureau also considered it qualified and allowed it to participate, as evidenced by the bid announcement and price list. Unexpectedly, when the company went to bid on time on February 12, it was blocked by Zhuo Chunji, who used his tricks to prevent the company from participating. The facts are unbearable. Now, the company will point out its selfishness, unfairness, and inconsistency: (1) There were originally 12 bidders, and 9 were qualified after review. The company was one of the reviewed parties. However, there was a sudden change when bidding, and only 4 were allowed to participate, deliberately allowing a small number of people to manipulate and make profits. (2) Zhuo Chunji's price for each set of school desks and chairs was 113,000 national currency, while the company's price was only 91,600 yuan and 100,650 yuan, as evidenced by the filled price list, which was rejected and kept sealed. The difference between the two is more than 20,000 yuan per set, totaling more than 200 million yuan. It is not difficult to see that he deliberately wasted huge amounts of public funds." According to the original petition from Shanghai School Equipment Company, "At that time, the supervisory officials insisted that the Social Bureau's business registration submitted by the company was a temporary receipt and could not be used as evidence, and refused to allow it to participate. Although the company stated its reasons, it was not adopted, and it was even said that if there was any injustice, you could file a lawsuit. It was found that there were 9 qualified bidders participating in the bidding that day. In an instant, only 4 were allowed to participate. Lu Fushun, who had always built a reputation, felt very dissatisfied and questioned him severely, and he was speechless, so he was allowed to participate. The result of the bidding was that Yang Heji won the bid with 100,400 yuan, and then it was changed to Zhuo Chunji to contract at 114,000 yuan. The company's original bid price was 95,000 yuan per set, which is more than 200 million yuan different from Zhuo Chunji's total bid price. At this time of national revival, funds are needed everywhere. It is incomprehensible to abandon the small and recognize the big and reverse the facts."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Asks the Delegation to Japan to Unify the Names of Overseas Chinese Schools in Japan All Named Chinese Elementary School or Middle School with the Name of the Place</h3>

<p>Take on the Responsibility of Educating Taiwanese Compatriots</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Our delegation to Japan previously suggested to the Ministry of Education to organize a roving educational lecture tour to go to various parts of Japan to educate overseas Chinese, especially Taiwanese overseas Chinese, who have been isolated from the culture of the motherland for a long time and urgently need to be cultivated by the culture of the motherland. After repeated consideration, the Ministry of Education believes that the faculty of domestic universities is already in short supply and cannot send professors to Japan to take on this work. At the same time, our country's consulates in various parts of Japan have not yet been established, and the overseas Chinese groups have not been restored. It would be difficult to go there at this time, but there are many scholars and experts in the delegation to Japan who can take on this responsibility. The Ministry of Education has recently informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and transferred it to the delegation to Japan, asking the fourth group of the delegation to take on the responsibility of educating Taiwanese compatriots.</p>

<h3>New World of Basketball Teams – Columbus's Strength Is Formidable – Shan Team's Performance Was Wonderful Despite Losing</h3>
<p>Last night's final basketball league game was originally between the Shan team and the Encas team. However, the Encas team requested a postponement due to unforeseen circumstances. The game was changed to a friendly match between the Shan team and the U.S. military Columbus team. The match was very exciting, and the fans continued to rave about it after the game.</p>
<p>The Columbus team is a U.S. Navy basketball team that recently arrived in Shanghai. Recently, the person in charge of the team accompanied the Navy and Marine Corps Youth Team to the Municipal Gymnasium to watch the game and planned to hold friendly matches with various Chinese teams. The person in charge of the team said: The team will stay in China for a month. Fans are lucky. The new world of salt ball teams, Columbus, has been discovered.</p>
<p>The Columbus basketball team is quite strong. Sixteen players took to the court last night, and there were still three players who did not play. Each player is tall and strong, combining the strengths of the Navy and Marine Corps Youth Team and the Giants team, being both lively and fierce. They are not as rough as the Navy and Marine Corps Youth Team, nor are they as slow as the Giants team.</p>
<p>Columbus's offensive tactics are to have two tall players, Ashe and Clowmey, stand under the enemy's basket, where they can reach the basket ring with their hands. Others can only stand by and watch. The Shan team's performance last night was also very wonderful. Lin Weiting's long-range shots were especially impressive. In a group of iron tower-like people, he made four clean shots in a row, which was really exhilarating.</p>
<p>The Shan team's loss yesterday was a glorious loss. Judging from Columbus's strength, there is no team in Shanghai that can match them today. The reason why the score difference last night was so small was that the foreign generals had a lot of opportunities to show their skills by frequently substituting players. However, they were still a little short, and Lin Weicong and others repeatedly scored more than a dozen points. The Columbus veterans saw that the situation was not good and put the old squad back on the court. However, it was too late, and they only won by a small margin.</p>
<p>The Columbus team's uniforms are light yellow with purple-red shorts. The squad consists of Ashe (20), Clowmey (13), Bosak (4), Bubber (21), and Burke (14). The positions are center, guard, left forward, left guard, and right forward. The key to scoring the most points is Bosak (4). (German)</p>

<h3>Gold, U.S. Dollars, and Grain Prices Stabilize After Recent Fluctuations – Government Bonds Suddenly Surge – From 3,800 Yuan to 7,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The rise in government bonds was even more intense yesterday. With the court's ruling and the legislators' proposals, the rumors of repaying deposits at multiple times became louder. The Tongbing bonds opened at 4,000 yuan in the morning, and there was a scramble to buy them. Hot money sought an outlet, and the price was pushed up sharply. Room 360 and Room 552, among others, also entered the market. Although some large investors, such as Chen De in Room 550 and Room 604, took profits, they could not contain the buying frenzy. The price gradually rose to 7,500 yuan at the close, resulting in a doubling compared to the previous close. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu bonds also increased by more than double, with sharp increases of 2,500 to 3,700 yuan. The total transaction volume reached over 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the gold market has been quiet recently, and hot money has turned to attacking Chinese stocks and government bonds. Yesterday, under the competition of many parties, the price of government bonds soared again. According to related sources, the reasons are: First, yesterday's newspaper reported that the Legislative Yuan was dissatisfied with the one-to-one repayment of government bonds. Second, the deadline for supplementary payment of overdue bond tickets has been extended to the end of March this year. In addition, there are rumors in the market that the government will issue national construction gold bonds. It is observed that before issuing new bonds, the old bonds must be settled first to maintain creditworthiness. It is said that official capital purchased a large number of government bonds at the end of last year in order to try to demand that the government increase the repayment rate. Various rumors abound, and the price of Tongbing bonds finally soared in a sea of positive news.</p>
<h3>Increased Arrivals – Grain Prices Continue to Decline – Edible Oil Prices are Weak and People are Pessimistic</h3>
<p>The grain market continued to decline yesterday. After the approved price was raised, vendors from all over the suburbs heard the news and transported grain to the city. The number of arrivals in the two markets increased sharply, with a total of 2,406.5 shi, three times more than the previous day. The South Market received 2,505 shi, and the North Market received 4901.5 shi. The sample platforms, which had been without goods for a long time, were widely seen in the market yesterday. Therefore, the supply increased, and rice shops were able to replenish their stocks as usual. In addition, the military and police authorities organized an economic reconnaissance network to secretly investigate rice worms that hoarded and manipulated grain prices. Therefore, speculators had no room for activity and were afraid of being punished. They were secretly selling their stocks quickly. The serious situation no longer exists. Transactions are gradually becoming more transparent, and the situation is returning to normal. Thick and thin rice and Xian rice all fell by about 5,000 yuan. The Yinbian yuan also fell by 10,000 yuan. However, high-end white粳 rice is still in short supply.</p>
<p>Flour has re-entered a state of fatigue. Because the factory-supplied flour has been sufficient for local sales recently, retail stores have become sluggish. Therefore, there are very few transactions. In the early market, there were many sellers. The Lilang foreign flour was lowered to 75,000 yuan, and the Jiu Tong flour was also lowered to 39,000 yuan, but there were no buyers. Therefore, the sellers gradually lowered their prices. The Lilang foreign flour opened low at 73,600 yuan, and the Jiu Tong flour also lowered to 38,000 yuan. The Shai Tong No. 2 flour was 46,000 yuan. The prices of various brands of flour were lowered by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There were a few transactions, but the market still showed a situation of supply exceeding demand. The Jiu Tong flour was 37,000 yuan, and the Shai Tong flour was 44,000 yuan. Due to the trickery of unscrupulous merchants, the transaction of bran was secretive. It was heard that the relief agency sent personnel to the market to inquire about prices. Only large bags of overnight goods were quoted at 31,500 yuan. The situation was unusually quiet. Although there were no transactions for large and small bags, the prices were 1,000 to 2,000 yuan firmer than the previous day. There was no transaction of wheat.</p>
<p>Edible oil: The market is sluggish. The initial market quotation was similar to the previous market. In the end, the actual sales were slow. In addition, the news from various grain stores was pessimistic, and people were pessimistic. The traders lowered their prices. Basket peanut oil opened at 245,000 yuan and fell to 240,000 yuan. Jiton peanut oil opened at 275,000 yuan and closed at noon at 270,000 yuan, a decrease of 10,000 yuan. There were still few inquiries in the afternoon. Soybean oil and Kunshan goods also lowered by 10,000 yuan, with the price at 290,000 yuan. Small car sesame oil also fell by 5,000 yuan. Factory clear oil was 240,000 yuan, with transactions.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains: Yellow beans are still actively sold in the street. It was previously reported that the arrival of goods from the Northeast would take some time. Therefore, Dalian and Tianjin goods rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and the market was firm. Picked green beans are rare and rose by several thousand yuan. Sesame seeds are in a stagnant state, and the price is stable. Nanyang merchants are interested in green beans and continued to add 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The distilleries are purchasing red beans and corn in the market, and the prices have risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Peanut kernels are sluggish, and the market price has fallen by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Bean cake was flat and then weak. Speculators disappeared, and the price was reduced by 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Oil Rationing – No Conclusion Reached</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai edible oil manufacturers Xie Yuxiang, Li Tinglian, Zhou Weibo, and Zhang Chao visited Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon to discuss the problems of edible oil rationing in the city and the supply of raw materials for oil extraction. However, no conclusion was reached. It is heard that they will meet again at 10:00 AM tomorrow to discuss how the China Trust Bureau can continuously supply cheap raw materials and maintain edible oil production.</p>
<p>Also, although the price of edible oil has fallen recently following the decline in gold and silver, the cost of production in the production area has increased. The Qingdao peanut oil has risen to 250,000 yuan per dan. If it is rationed at the limited price of 170,000 yuan, the loss will be too great. It is extremely difficult to resume rationing before a reasonable adjustment is made. In addition, Zhongzhi Factory rationed 700 dan of cottonseed oil yesterday (the 15th), still at the limited price of 155,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice and Cotton Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The "Newburg" ship, represented by the American Flett Shipping Company, loaded seven to eight thousand tons of foreign rice and cotton from Santos, South America, and is expected to arrive in port around the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains and Fertilizers Shipped to Guangdong</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Haiyue ship sailed from Shanghai to Guangzhou Bay and Xiamen the day before yesterday, carrying more than 370 bags of beans, 25,150 pieces of bean cake, and 2,000 bags of flour to Xiamen. 1,550 bags of peanut kernels and 88 pieces of peanut oil were shipped to Guangdong. Also, the Haihu ship sailed to Guangdong the day before yesterday, carrying 1,000 pieces of cotton yarn, 1,200 bags of peanut kernels, and 230 pieces of tea oil.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market fell sharply with the sharp fall in gold prices. The public association's spot goods, including medium sugar white and raw sugar red, fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Four cow-carriage white fell by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Three and a half army white fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Peruvian fine sand fell by about 20,000 yuan. The 24 coarse white stack order was only 194,000 to 7,000 yuan. It was found that the bid price of the Taiwan Company was 190,000 yuan, and the profit was also limited. The crazy period of the sugar market has passed, and it is gradually entering a normal state. The price of numbered goods also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The price of Tikao was 130,000 yuan, and the price of Shunde Qing was 125,000 yuan. A total of hundreds of packages were traded. However, it is heard that the production price has soared with the Shanghai market, but after this setback, it will inevitably form a upside-down situation.</p>
<h3>Tea Market is Firm Amidst Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market maintained a firm tone amidst the quiet. The sellers continued to have the intention of hoarding and selling at higher prices. Although the buying interest from all parties was still increasing, it was difficult to get what they wanted. Although transactions were not optimistic, the selling price was unusually firm. Recently, the Suzhou merchants have a great demand for jasmine tea and are currently planning to ask tea merchants in this city for tea samples for selection and purchase. It is also reported that Wang Yutai Tea Shop is also interested in the 34-year-old Keemun red tea. It is currently actively negotiating with the Anhui Tea Company. It is heard that the price difference is not far, and it is expected that a transaction will be reached within days.</p>
<h3>Paper Quota Allocation Not Yet Decided – Newspaper Orders Approved First – Quantity Included in This Year's Quota</h3>
<p>The quota allocation for paper is still being carefully reviewed by the Import Management Committee. Because there are many types of paper, the uses must be investigated in detail. Therefore, the qualifications of paper importers have not yet been approved, and the quota allocation cannot be started. It is learned that the committee is speeding up the process and will be able to resolve everything within this month. In order to facilitate the needs of the news industry, the committee has given priority to approving the import of newsprint ordered by newspapers before the end of December last year. The quantity approved for this item will be included in this year's quota. According to the person in charge of the Import Management Committee, the purpose of including paper in the quota this time is to save foreign exchange. In the future, the import of paper will be determined based on the national needs.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Stores are Quiet – Refuse to Accept Miscellaneous Brands</h3>
<p>Although the Central Bank sold gold as usual yesterday, very few jewelry stores applied because gold shops were virtually closed. The number was only fifteen bars. The jewelry industry opened and operated as usual yesterday, with the listed price being 660,000 yuan, and the purchase limit was canceled. They supplied as much as possible. However, there were very few people buying gold jewelry, and they refused to accept the exchange of gold jewelry from brands other than their own. Before the authorities announced the entire financial stabilization plan, all jewelry stores were unwilling to take risks and suffer losses. They all took a wait-and-see attitude to wait for the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Becomes Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was weak because Fangjian Company's fine cloth sales on Friday were all purchased according to the order. This caused the market to be flooded with spot goods, and the dyeing factories became sluggish. Yesterday, the blue chicken white cloth was sold as usual, with the price being 145,000 yuan. People were unanimously pessimistic. The price of fine cloth in each stall fell sharply by 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. The price of jumping carp bleached cloth fell by 20,000 yuan. The price of dark-colored Shilin Meiting also saw a small decrease of about 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver are Calm</h3>
<p>Although the central bank did not allocate much gold yesterday, people were still calm. The price rose slightly after falling. It opened in the morning at 5.9 million to 6.1 million. There were still some settlements. The price fell to 5.8 million. Then there were actual sales to maintain the price, and it gradually stabilized. After ten o'clock, the central bank allocated 15 bars at a price of 6.3 million. After that, the high price reached 6.6 million. Near noon, it fell back to 6.2 million. At noon, it hovered between 6.3 million and 6.4 million. In the afternoon, there was not much activity because it was Saturday. The asking price was around 6.3 million. The result was a slight increase compared to the previous close. The price of gold jewelry was 660,000 yuan. The price of silver dollars fell slightly again. The secret loan interest rate was relaxed. The secret interest rate was only about 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange was very calm yesterday. The U.S. dollar hovered between 12,000 and 13,000 in the sunny market. There was no special change from morning to noon. There was no change in the afternoon because it was Saturday. The result was no honor or disgrace compared to the previous close. The price of Hong Kong dollar was slightly lower. The price of Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams rose to 40 yuan. The result continued to decline by 200 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 2,650 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 3,250 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 42,400 yuan. Except for the Hong Kong exchange rate, there were not many transactions.</p>
<h3>Central Bank to Discuss the Issue of Silk Merchants Returning Spring Loans</h3>
<p>Since the government announced the purchase of autumn silk, which was mainly organized by the Central Trust Bureau, the factories have successively delivered their silk. As of the 4th of this month, the total amount reached 1,187 dan, including 62 dan of autumn silk and 325 dan of zero-baked cocoon silk. It is estimated that the total amount of autumn silk, including zero-baked cocoons, is about 2,800 dan. The amount purchased by the Central Trust Bureau only accounts for one-quarter. As for the reasons for the manufacturers' delay in delivery, it is known that according to the regulations of the Central Bank, those who have not cleared their spring cocoon loans must send the spring silk they have spun to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase at 3.8 million yuan per dan. Only after the spring loans have been cleared can autumn silk be purchased. Manufacturers refuse to accept the return of spring loans in cash.</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Opinions: According to manufacturers' opinions as follows: (1) Those who collect more cocoons will inevitably extend the spinning period. If the raw silk is spun before August and September of last year and purchased at 3.8 million yuan per dan, the loss will not be too great. If the raw silk is spun later, the cost per dan has reached 4.5 million to 5 million yuan due to the sharp increase in spinning labor costs along with the rise in prices and the burden of interest. If the current silk price is lower than 3.8 million yuan, the manufacturers have no choice but to painfully send the silk for purchase. In order to avoid troubling the government, they will no longer ask for a price increase. The current market price exceeds 3.8 million yuan. In order to reduce losses, manufacturers cannot give up the opportunity. (2) Manufacturers with weak financial resources cannot pay the 30% down payment for spring cocoon loans, insurance, and prepaid interest. They have poor capital turnover and are exploited by high-interest loans. Spring silk suffers huge losses and cannot stop production. They are forced to pawn or sell the spun silk. If they must send the spring silk for purchase at 3.8 million yuan to repay the spring loans, it is impossible. It is also learned that the Central Bank has paid close attention to this issue and has scheduled a meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow to convene the heads of the silk reeling industry association in the third district and the spring cocoon loan office to discuss the matter. It is expected that it will not be difficult to find a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>Nuclear Allocation Committee Discusses Cotton Stocks of Private Yarn Factories</h3>
<p>In addition to approving the purchase of cotton for various state-owned yarn factories and a few private yarn factories according to emergency applications last month, the Foreign Cotton Nuclear Allocation Committee did not complete the nuclear allocation for most private yarn factories until yesterday because the declaration of cotton stocks and the calculation of forms had been completed. Therefore, the committee will convene a meeting today to discuss the cotton stocks of various private yarn factories and the nuclear allocation of cotton purchases. According to the person in charge of the committee yesterday, most of the cotton stocks of various private yarn factories can maintain production for at least two months. Although a few factories are running out of cotton, the number is very small. The review standard for this audit is also based on the principle of leniency. The committee calculates the number of days each factory is open per month (26 days) and the existing number of spindles. The spindles that have been shut down due to power outages and some damaged spindles have not been deducted.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Turns Firm from Weak as Peers Take Advantage of Low Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak at first and then firm yesterday. In the early morning, it was heard that the gold market had been virtually suspended, and the holders were temporarily panicked and sold their goods at lower prices. The price of Twin Horse brand fell to the 4 million yuan mark, and the price of Red Kui Xing brand fell to 3.1 million yuan. Then, peers took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the price gradually rose again. At the close, the former reached 4.4 million yuan, and the latter rose to 3.35 million yuan. The results were a mixture of honor and disgrace, and were roughly the same as the market price the day before.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Quality is Poor – Textile Management's Purchase is Difficult</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Management Committee has been purchasing cotton yarn, and more than a dozen yarn factories have submitted their stack orders. According to the person in charge of the committee, the committee found that the F and G grade standards of the yarn samples from each factory were unqualified. In order to take into account the practical difficulties, the committee may cancel this grade in the future. Also, most of the yarn samples from each yarn factory are rated as E grade, and very few are rated as A grade. According to regulations, the purchase price of E-grade cotton yarn must be deducted by 10%. Therefore, the committee hopes that each yarn factory should strive to improve the quality of cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>New Buying Continues, Chinese Stocks' Rising Momentum Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks, held by strong hands, were not released. New buying continued to pour in, and short sellers suffered another defeat. The rising momentum remained strong. At the opening in the morning, current delivery stocks still saw continued lows. When deferred delivery entered the market, there was a sudden rebound. After the opening, buying became competitive. Numbers 7, 8, 224, 152, 145, 232, 181, and 188 all entered the market. Market participants fiercely pushed up prices, causing them to rise rapidly. China General Edison first reached its daily limit. Deferred Evergreen Silk rose to 1675 yuan. Numbers 105, 91, 155, and 133 sold off and retreated to 1610 yuan. Number 224 exited and immediately re-entered. Numbers 85 and 22 came in, rising to 1660 yuan. Numbers 177, 145, 224, 204, and 186 were still selling, and it fell to 1610 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, there was a major fluctuation, hovering between 1610 yuan and 1640 yuan. Later, numbers 4, 85, 155, 14, 181, 151, 112, 84, 97, and 57 all entered the market. At 11:30, the buying momentum surged, and market participants pushed up prices without end, causing it to rebound to 1715 yuan. Numbers 188, 184, and 181 sold off rapidly at high prices, retreating to 1670 yuan. Numbers 97, 4, 57, and 17 were still coming in. Numbers 125, 129, 198, 106, 145, 188, 12, and 156 were selling. At noon, it fell from above 1700 yuan, struggling again to around 1670 yuan. There was a large crowd of longs. Off-market interest was as high as two jiao, five fen, and a half, and even three jiao. As a result, compared to the previous close, Evergreen Silk and King Fu rose by 10%, China General Edison reached its daily limit, and Sino-British, American Asia, New Light, and Diligence Industries each rose by a strong 5%. In deferred delivery, Evergreen Silk rose by 10%, China General Edison reached its daily limit, and American Asia, New Light, and Sino-British each rose by a strong 5%. Cold stocks such as Commercial Press and Match Factory rose by a strong 5%. Underwear and National Goods slightly decreased, Cement rose by 15%, and the rest rose slightly. Among the various off-market stocks, except for China and World, which remained stable, the rest each rose slightly or by 10%.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also rebounded yesterday, and the various stocks were extremely stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, Steel Industry, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Broad Industries, Paper Industry, Jardine Brewery, and Navigation Industry all saw slight increases, and Jardine Silk rose by 5%.</p>
<h3>General Administration of Banks to Purchase Industrial and Mining Materials from the United States</h3>
<p>In order to assist factories and shops throughout the country that have been destroyed by the war and to develop domestic industry, the General Administration of Banks has recently negotiated with the United States to order a large quantity of industrial and mining equipment, water and power plant equipment, and building materials such as cement, bricks, and lumber. It is now known that the Industry and Mining Committee of the Administration has decided to openly distribute these materials to merchants and civilians in need. Any public enterprises or industrial and commercial companies established with the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs that have suffered losses in the war and are unable to develop their businesses may apply to local branches or the four banks, including the Central Bank, China Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, as well as the Central Trust Bureau and Postal Savings Bureau. The materials ordered are divided into two types: spot goods and futures. Spot goods are paid for and taken in US dollars, and the legal tender can be converted at the official rate of the Central Bank. Futures are paid in three installments, and the receiving bank recognizes statutory interest (7 li per month), which will be calculated together when the goods are delivered.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Prices Reported to Rise in Producing Areas, Coconut Oil Plummets Sharply</h3>
<p>The market price of tung oil has risen by another 20,000 yuan per dan. Producing areas have repeatedly reported rising prices. In particular, the tung oil in Hunan and Hubei is the strongest in the country. There is no longer any exportable amount of tung oil of sufficient quality in the Shanghai market. Traders are only using it for domestic sales. According to people in the industry, with tung oil prices rising in producing areas, it will be difficult for the Shanghai market to stabilize. Yesterday, the market for coconut oil plunged sharply. The price was 500,000 yuan per dan. Many retail investors sold off. As for asphalt, due to limited arrivals and undiminished actual sales, the price remained at its original level. Although the market price of butter increased to 480,000 yuan per dan, there were not many transactions. Retail transactions were mostly at 450,000 to 460,000 yuan per dan for the best quality.</p>
<h3>China Textile Construction Opens Sales of Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, a total of 10,570 pieces.

Among the allocated cloth pieces, there were 8,960 pieces of fine cloth and 1,610 pieces of colored cloth.</p>
<h3>High Prices of Yarn in South China, Many Applications for Transporting Yarn to the South</h3>
<p>The fourth period for transporting yarn and cloth to South China is scheduled to end on the 25th of this month. In previous periods, the number of applications for yarn was higher than for cloth. There are even more applicants this period. According to general speculation, the price of yarn in South China is higher than in this city, so merchants are competing to transport it there for sale. In order to limit the large-scale export of this yarn and cloth, the shipping authorities are still strictly handling the review process according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Beijing's Food Administration Formulates Five Measures</h3>
<p>According to Nanjing News Agency, food prices in Beijing are rising. The municipal government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to formulate measures for food businesses to apply for food allocation. The contents are as follows: (1) Grain merchants should fill out an application form based on their usual business conditions, and the industry association should verify the daily quantity required, then report it to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, pay the designated bank, and pick up the grain from the designated warehouse. (2) The profit from selling allocated food, in addition to the purchase price plus transportation costs, should not exceed 6% for rice and should not exceed 5% for flour. Prices should be marked uniformly for sale. (3) The quantity and price of food supplied shall be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau in consultation with the food authorities. (4) Grain merchants should register the names and addresses of customers who purchase more than five dou of rice or one bag of flour in detail for inspection purposes. (5) The rice or flour allocated to grain merchants should be sold immediately after purchase and should not be hoarded or resold. The above regulations have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and filed with the Ministry of Food. Violations of items (3), (4), and (5) will be punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing violations of food management during the emergency period.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Rayon Yarn, Strictly Prohibiting Hoarding or Resale</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the rayon yarn allocated by the Central Trust Bureau to silk yarn businesses has flowed into the black market and is not being used for production. However, this has not been detected so far. The Silk Weaving Industry Association reiterated its previous order that any business that hoards or resells allocated rayon yarn will have its allocation permanently suspended, the goods will be recovered, and the matter will be reported to the competent authority for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Carbon Arc and Live Livestock Approved for Import, Supplement to the Transport Management Commission's Public Announcement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Transport Management Commission issued Public Announcement No. 8, correcting two items that were omitted from the classification table. The supplementary information is as follows: (1) Carbon arc, originally listed in Appendix (3.B), is now needed by cinemas in various places. Regarding this application, the Central Bank has approved its reclassification into Appendix (3.A). (2) Live livestock belonging to mixed and improved breeds, as well as those needed for extracting raw dairy products, originally listed in Appendix (3.B), are now also reclassified into Appendix (3.A), and are approved for import.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty Negotiations Over the Past Six Months</h3>
<p>— Manila, 4th Dispatch from Our Correspondent in the Philippines, Lin Shen</p>
<p>While enjoying the benefits of the "Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty," the overseas Chinese in the Philippines will certainly immediately recall the planter of this treaty, former Philippine Consul-General Dr. Duan Maolan.</p>
<p>The Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty was initiated after the liberation of the Philippines. Shortly after taking office, Dr. Duan, recognizing the rampant anti-Chinese sentiment, felt that it was imperative to establish a treaty between the two countries as a permanent solution to provide a basis for action. Furthermore, with the Philippines having declared independence, a treaty between China and the Philippines was even more necessary for the survival and protection of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The Planter, Dr. Duan Maolan</p>
<p>In November 1945, Dr. Duan discussed the matter with Mr. McNutt, the highest American commissioner in the Philippines. At that time, the Philippines had not yet become independent, and diplomatic affairs were still handled within the U.S. High Commissioner's Office. Mr. McNutt immediately agreed to assist and suggested to Dr. Duan that he formally discuss the matter with then-Philippine President Osmeña. Dr. Duan then requested instructions from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, as our ministry was returning to Nanjing, there was no response for a long time.</p>
<p>In March 1946, the Ministry telegraphed Dr. Duan to tentatively discuss the matter of signing a treaty with the Philippines. Dr. Duan followed the order and immediately obtained the support of former Philippine President Osmeña and the Foreign Affairs Committee, which was jointly established by the U.S. and Philippine authorities at the time. However, as President Osmeña and current President Roxas were in the midst of a heated election campaign, the treaty matter was temporarily put on hold again. It was not until the Philippines became independent and current President Roxas took office.</p>
<p>In June 1946, our consulate finally received the full text of the treaty from our Ministry via telegram, instructing Dr. Duan to study it and consider submitting it to the soon-to-be-officially-independent Philippine government. After careful study, Dr. Duan submitted the entire draft to Philippine President Roxas. Shortly thereafter, the Philippines became independent, and the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established. Our government sent Special Envoy Gan Naiguang and Treaty Division Chief Wang Huacheng to the Philippines to attend the ceremony and planned to take the opportunity to discuss the treaty with the Philippines. However, due to Mr. Gan's short stay in the Philippines, no concrete achievements were made. Therefore, Dr. Duan continued to handle the matter. Subsequently, Dr. Duan held several consultations and discussions with Philippine Foreign Minister and Vice President Quirino. In August of the same year, the Philippine side first decided to propose amendments. The amendments to our treaty draft were as follows:</p>
<p>Philippine's First Proposed Amendments</p>
<p>(A) The following were required to be added by the Philippine side:</p>
<p>(1) The contracting country is a sovereign nation and has the right to promulgate any law. The residents of the other contracting country have the obligation to abide by it. (Note: If this item is recognized, if the Philippine government promulgates a law in the future stating that overseas Chinese may not engage in retail or wholesale trade, our overseas Chinese will also have the obligation to comply. This is clearly stipulated in the friendship treaty.)</p>
<p>(2) The two contracting countries shall not use force to resolve disputes but shall resolve them through mediation or arbitration.</p>
<p>(3) The nationals of the contracting countries shall not participate in political activities in the other contracting country.</p>
<p>(4) The contracting country may conscript nationals of the other contracting country into military service during wartime.</p>
<p>(5) China shall not enjoy the special privileges granted by the Republic of the Philippines to the United States.</p>
<p>(B) The Philippine side requested the cancellation of the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The security guarantee of the persons and property of the nationals of the contracting countries in the other contracting country.</p>
<p>(2) National treatment regarding judicial matters and tax obligations.</p>
<p>(3) Cancellation of the most-favored-nation treatment for entry and exit, travel, and residence, and compliance with the laws of the contracting country.</p>
<p>(4) Cancellation of the most-favored-nation treatment regarding schools, churches, cemeteries, etc., and the acquisition of inheritance, transfer, and disposal of movable and immovable property.</p>
<p>Our Side Proposes Amendments</p>
<p>The first and second items to be cancelled by the Philippine side as mentioned above were negotiated by Dr. Duan and Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino on the same day. The Philippine side agreed to add them at his request. Dr. Duan immediately returned to Beijing for instructions. Three weeks later, he returned to Manila and presented our side's amendments to the Philippine side. The amendments included the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The fact that a country has the sovereignty to promulgate laws and that the two contracting countries shall not use force to resolve disputes is recognized internationally. There are now also provisions of the United Nations Organization. This point does not need to be stated in the treaty.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the previously proposed "most-favored-nation treatment," our country adopts the principle of equal treatment for the people of all countries. In order to avoid discrimination, it should be added to the text without any other intention.</p>
<p>(3) It is obvious that the nationals of the contracting countries shall not participate in political activities in the other contracting country. It seems unnecessary to include it.</p>
<p>(4) If one of the contracting countries participates in a war that is prohibited by the United Nations Organization, it would violate the intent of the United Nations if the nationals of the other contracting country had the obligation to serve in the military. Therefore, the treaty should not include it. Furthermore, friendship treaties usually do not involve conscription.</p>
<p>(5) China recognizes that the special privileges of the United States in the Philippines cannot be enjoyed equally, but the wording of the original article should be modified.</p>
<p>The Philippine side did not respond to the above amendments for a long time. Later, Minister Chen Zhi-ping arrived from the United States and the embassy was established. As of October 5, 1946, there was still no response. As Dr. Duan was about to return home to take up his new position, he paid another visit to the Philippine Foreign Minister to discuss the content of the amendments in detail. Three days later, the Philippine Foreign Minister sent the reply to the embassy. The content, in addition to deleting the stipulation that the nationals of the contracting countries shall not participate in the political activities of the other country, still disagreed with several of our proposed amendments. Subsequently, Dr. Duan was ordered to go to London to take up his new position and brought the Philippine counterpart back to the Ministry for consideration. Soon, the Ministry instructed the embassy to continue consultations according to the previous intention.</p>
<p>Conclusions of Further Consultations</p>
<p>On October 27, Minister Chen Zhi-ping and Philippine Foreign Minister and Vice President Quirino discussed in detail and reached the following four conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) The Philippine government agreed to cancel the stipulation that the contracting country has the right to promulgate any law and the nationals of the other contracting country have the obligation to comply with it. (Note: The rights and interests of Filipinos in our country are few, while our rights and interests in the Philippines are many. If the Philippines promulgates a law that is unfavorable to our nationals, we can also promulgate a law that is equally unfavorable to Filipino nationals to resist it. This will have no practical impact on the Philippines.)</p>
<p>(2) The Philippines agreed to add the most-favored-nation treatment item.</p>
<p>(3) The Philippine side insisted on not giving up the conscription item. (Note: There are only a few hundred Filipino residents in our country, mostly music teachers, while there are more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines.) The next day, Minister Chen Zhi-ping met with the Philippine Foreign Minister again to discuss the conscription issue, wanting to change the word "conscription" to "volunteer soldier," arguing for as long as three hours. As a result, the Philippine side still could not seek instructions and stayed in Beijing for 40 consecutive days. On December 10, he returned to Manila and paid a visit to the Philippine Foreign Minister the next day. After detailed discussions, the following results were finally achieved with great difficulty:</p>
<p>(1) The Philippine side agreed to cancel conscription.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the special privileges of the United States in the Philippines, our side recognizes that we cannot enjoy them equally, but we request that if the Philippine side grants these privileges to any third country other than the United States, China shall enjoy them equally.</p>
<p>(3) Our side accepts "cannot use force to resolve disputes" and adds the use of diplomatic means of mediation or arbitration to resolve them.</p>
<p>A Little Twist Before Signing the Treaty</p>
<p>From this point of view, the opinions of both sides were generally consistent at this time, so both sides were preparing to sign the treaty. However, the Philippine side's final draft was delayed. It was not until January 10 of this year that it was known that there was a twist behind the Philippine side's failure to submit the final draft. On that day, three points of change were proposed:</p>
<p>(1) If China wants to enjoy the privileges granted by the Philippines to a third country other than the United States, the conditions must be the same as those of that third country. (Meaning that if the British obtain mining rights in the Philippines, it is conditional on allowing Filipinos to fish in British territorial waters, then China must also allow Filipinos to fish in Chinese waters if it wants to enjoy mining rights in the Philippines.)</p>
<p>(2) If China grants privileges to any third country, the Philippines may also enjoy them under the same conditions. (Meaning that if China grants aviation rights to the United States, Filipinos can also enjoy them.)</p>
<p>(3) If one party to this treaty wants to terminate it, it should notify the other party one year in advance.</p>
<p>Our Ministry Expresses Two Opinions</p>
<p>After receiving these three changes, the embassy telegraphed the Ministry for instructions. The Ministry then instructed the embassy to express the following two opinions to the Philippine side:</p>
<p>(1) China treats all countries equally and does not grant any privileges to any country. Therefore, the Philippine side's last request does not need to be added.</p>
<p>(2) If the termination of the treaty is stipulated in this way, the effective period may be one year. If it is insisted that this provision be added, a fixed effective period of ten or twenty years must be added.</p>
<p>The negotiations for the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty had been going on for half a year since Dr. Duan submitted the draft to President Roxas. Both sides had agreed on the main points. The remaining issues were only minor issues and textual modifications. Therefore, Minister Chen met with the Philippine Foreign Minister on January 29 of this year and then established a "four-person ad hoc committee." The Philippine side consisted of Foreign Deputy Africa and legal expert Madamba, and our side consisted of Embassy Secretary Sun and Xue Yuqi to conduct a final detailed study of the text of the entire treaty and minor details, and to determine a form acceptable to both parties for the plenipotentiaries of the two countries to sign. The negotiation process of the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty over the past six months has been as described above, and the main points of the treaty are also as described above.</p>
<p>Those who represented our country in the negotiations for the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty this time were former Consul-General Dr. Duan Maolan and Secretary Xue Yuqi. Those who continued their efforts and completed the matter were Minister Chen Zhi-ping and Secretaries Sun Biqi and Xue Yuqi. Those who represented the Philippine side in the negotiations were Philippine Foreign Minister and Vice President Quirino, Foreign Deputy Africa, and legal expert Madamba.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Overseas Chinese Arts and Crafts in France (Report from Our Special Correspondent in Paris, Wang Ren, with Photos)</p>
<h3>Holding One Skill, Traveling the World: A Record of Chinese Artistic Talents in France</h3>
<p>— Paris, February 1st Dispatch from Our Special Correspondent Wang Ren</p>
<p>Woodcarving Craftsman</p>
<p>Since Li Shizeng and other enlightened men advocated frugal study in France, numerous talents have emerged in the past 30 years. For example, Mr. Zhu Zhiqing, a woodcarving craftsman from Nanchong, Sichuan, who lives in the 11th arrondissement of Paris and runs a workshop in a quiet old house, as well as four or five unknown heroes in the artistic world with skillful hands and minds, are worth writing about in detail for their excellent achievements and broad sources of profit, to demonstrate the strength of our Chinese talents and to inspire the spirit of diligence and perseverance of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor. It is said that one of his colleagues who assists in the carving is named Ye Jin from Hangzhou. He is very good at French and also excels in arithmetic. Every night after work, he likes to study radio, excelling in both theory and experimentation. He gathers reference books and the necessary equipment, and during the day, he works as a craftsman in the carving workshop. At night, he studies diligently and has become a radio engineering talent.</p>
<p>Ye married in France 20 years ago, and his two sons and one daughter have all grown up. His daughter is even a lecturer at a school. The family is well-off, and he himself is as carefree as a feudal lord, enjoying human happiness, which is far beyond the imagination of those in the country who "waste their time playing mahjong and busy themselves pursuing fame and fortune."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu, who supervises all the products to meet French demand, was already able to paint when he went abroad at an early age, and was proficient in figures, flowers, landscapes, and other subjects. When he arrived in Paris, because the franc was gradually rising and the external exchange rate of the national currency was falling daily, he changed his plan to half-study and half-work, attending classes at the art academy on the one hand and setting up his own woodcarving workshop on the other. His products are numerous:</p>
<p>(1) Carved panels, also known as openwork wooden panels. Panneaux Sculptes (such as the two central panels on the upper ends of the left and right doors of the first picture, and the central panels on the left and right bed railings of the third picture), (2) Lacquer carving, which requires lacquering the woodenware more than a dozen times until it is about two fen thick before carving on the lacquer surface.</p>
<p>Westerners Cherish Coromandel</p>
<p>(3) The lacquerware that best demonstrates the characteristics of Chinese craftsmanship is called carved thread, that is, Fujian lacquer, which is first lacquered and then carved, colored, and finely painted to create Coromandel. According to legend, during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Allied forces disturbed Beijing and plundered precious treasures, which were fully loaded and transported to the West. When the warship arrived at the Coromandel coast in eastern British India, it suffered an accident and sank. More than a year later, the objects in the water were salvaged, and everything was destroyed, but the Chinese lacquerware was still as good as new. Westerners cherished this type of lacquerware and gave it the special name Coromandel. All woodenware that is painted with Western lacquer and carved is flawed in that it is afraid of heat. Another advantage of Chinese lacquer is that it is heat-resistant, which makes it particularly popular in Western society. (4) Line engraving Laque Grave first applies lacquer, then draws, and then carves very meticulously, which is also unique to China. (5) Raised gold painting. Relier en or, (6) Relief coloring. Relief en Couleu. The above two are largely similar. (7) Gold line painting Laqued'or, first lacquer, then apply gold paint, then fine gold painting (such as the central panels on the lower half of the left and right kitchen doors in the first circle), (8) Colored painting Polychrome, which is unique to China, divided into ancient and new styles, first apply lacquer, then color, and then fine gold line painting. (9) Inlay Incrustation, first deeply carve patterns or animal, bird, figure, landscape, and other shapes on the board surface, and then fill in with shells Nacre or stone pieces Pierre. This method cannot be produced in Europe and can only be repaired (such as the delicate work on the bed frame below the second Kang bed). The carvings inlaid by the Japanese are first gilded, then inlaid with ivory or fish bones. Japanese carved thread lacquerware is modeled after Chinese Fujian lacquer and has also been improved in its manufacture, always exceeding China's, while colored paintings are made in Persia, which are largely the same as Chinese ones, except that they combine gold painting with fine painting on a gold background. The ancient woodenware of the French Louis XV and XVI dynasties is also divided into "carved thread," "raised gold painting," "gold line painting," and "colored painting." It is said that they were first obtained from the Dutch who sailed to the East, and then France imitated their methods. The most valuable old lacquerware in France is those that are first modeled in France, sent to China for lacquering, and then sent back to Europe.</p>
<p>French Imitate Chinese Paintings</p>
<p>The second best are those that the French imitate Chinese paintings and reproduce locally in Europe. Among Western arts that have benefited from modern maritime transportation and have been subtly influenced by the admiration of Chinese style, other than porcelain, only lacquerware seems to be the case. If someone with a vision collects historical materials, supplements them with illustrations, and compiles a special book on Chinese and foreign woodcarving, it will surely become popular and inspire the Chinese people's confidence in traveling the world with their skills, which is not only beneficial to people's livelihoods but also contributes to the national economy.</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Warfare vs. Banditry!</h3>
<p>Before the Lunar New Year, we received an unfortunate piece of news: Yan'an has formally rejected the peace envoys' reopening of negotiations, unless the government recognizes the two conditions they previously proposed. This means the civil war will continue for a long time. Last May, when the National Army captured Changchun, Yan'an announced that they would wage guerrilla warfare for twenty years. On December 19th last year, the Wenhui Bao published Zhou Enlai's remarks: "The CCP will disrupt the government's military offensive within six months, and within a year, the entire government and economic structure of China will undergo major changes." It would be better if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could reach a decisive resolution than the current dragging situation. However, the prospect of major changes to China's entire government and economic structure is truly frightening to us ordinary people. Currently, transportation is disrupted, prices are soaring, and the people are already struggling to breathe under the pressure. If the destruction is further expanded, what kind of situation will China become? It's truly unimaginable. What the CCP calls changing the status quo is essentially extreme destruction, which is the result of guerrilla warfare. After the CCP lost Changchun, Chengde, Huaiyin, Heze, Zhangjiakou, and Andong last year, although there were still fierce battles in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong, the CCP's strategy has largely shifted to guerrilla warfare. They avoid direct conflict with the National Army, evading strength and exploiting weakness, moving hundreds of miles at a time, sometimes east, sometimes west, sometimes south, sometimes north, always unpredictable. Wherever they go, they not only forcibly conscript young men and seize resources, but also destroy everything. This situation is quite similar to the bandits at the end of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Since Japan's surrender in August two years ago, the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been characterized by talks and fights, fights and talks, talking while fighting, and fighting while talking. Now it has reached the point of a complete break. The government still intends to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to reopen peace talks, but Yan'an unexpectedly rejected the offer. It seems that guerrilla warfare will continue for a long time. We are all a bit chilled by the future of the country!</p>
<p>Of course, the CCP has ideology and organization, which is absolutely different from bandits. However, the policies it implements and the means it adopts harm the nation's vitality and the people's livelihood. What difference is there from the impact of bandits? If guerrilla warfare continues for ten or twenty years, China will not only lose its position as one of the five great powers in the international arena, but may also fall into the eighteenth level of hell, never to recover. Therefore, we all hope that if the CCP insists on fighting, it might as well engage in a decisive resolution with the National Army, rather than roaming around like bandits, stubbornly clinging to the strategy of guerrilla warfare, only to make the people suffer. At the same time, we also hope that the government will firmly adhere to its policies and not be as indecisive in suppressing bandits as the government at the end of the Ming Dynasty. We ordinary people certainly do not want war, but we cannot bear to drag on any longer. Choosing the lesser of two evils, we would rather have a decisive resolution to the Kuomintang-Communist dispute in the short term. At the same time, we all fervently hope that a miracle will suddenly appear between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and that the two parties will join hands in cooperation and work together to put the country on the path of construction.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>On Guan Liang's Art</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan</p>
<p>Mr. Guan Liang is a versatile individual: he is a Western-style painter who has also recently been trying new Chinese paintings; he is also a skilled violinist, fascinated by Chopin's nocturnes; he has a deep understanding of Chinese opera, able to sing, perform, and compose, possessing a thorough understanding of its essence; but the focus of his life's energy is concentrated on the creative work of painting, and his reputation is also based on his achievements in painting. He has dedicated himself to the Chinese art scene for more than twenty years, and he has a profound artistic achievement. In my opinion, he has already established himself as a master. However, his current works are distinctly different from those before the war. He has deeply understood the true meaning of artistic creation, he has established his unique ideas, and he has decided on the direction he should take, so he has produced a new and unique style. This is something worthy of our attention. I have superficially analyzed it, and Mr. Guan Liang's art today has two major characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) Possessing Original Spirit—Art is a kind of creation, not "reproduction" but "expression." When creating an illusion of a beautiful real scene, one should not be constrained by the natural form, but only seek to faithfully imitate the original state of the object. This is "reproduction." The so-called "expression," although it also creates a false image of a beautiful real scene, the formation of this false image uses the writer's unique techniques and incorporates the writer's "personality," giving the work a unique appearance. In other words: this is the so-called "unique spirit." True art must have this kind of creative and original element. If a writer lacks the ability to express himself and only seeks likeness, then he becomes a craftsman.</p>
<p>Mr. Guan Liang's temperament is gentle, elegant, and taciturn. When he speaks, he is soft-spoken and slow-paced, with the demeanor of a scholar. His recent works are quite consistent with this personality. The color tone is simple, rich in a light and lively charm; the brushstrokes are concise, with a thick and solid spirit; the subject matter is even more different from the ordinary, favoring the famous scenic spots of Bashan and Shuishui. Thus, strange peaks, bizarre rocks, and huge streams all appear on his wrist, forming a realm like that of Chinese landscape paintings. Therefore, the composition also breaks away from the cliches of Western landscape paintings, and the arrangement of positions is also similar to the artistic conception of Chinese flat-distance landscape paintings. Therefore, his works show everywhere that they do not fall into the conventional and are full of original spirit.</p>
<p>In addition to watercolor and oil paintings, Mr. Guan Liang also likes to use domestic paper and ink to try new Chinese paintings. With a few simple strokes, he captures the momentary impression and expresses the moving figures. This attempt has also been quite successful. Some say that this is just ink play, or that it resembles Bada Shanren (Zhu Da). I will not criticize it now; however, the refined dots and lines, the contrasting colors, and the expression of the complex temporal dynamics can actually activate the paper. This unique expressive skill cannot be achieved unless the skill reaches a realm of purification. In this, one can also glimpse the author's superb technique and his original spirit.</p>
<p>(2) Rich in National Color—Nationality is also an essential element in artistic creation. An artist is a member of a nation or a country, and his art is naturally a product of the nation. Therefore, if a work of art lacks the elements of nationality, it is like losing its soul. The culture of a country should have the characteristics of that country, and the art of a nation should have its own unique appearance; however, among the Western-style painters in our country, those who can pay attention to this and can do it are truly rare. Since Western art was introduced into China with the tide of the times, most art workers only know how to imitate without understanding, losing the soul of the nation. They not only ignore that culture is a reflection of nationality, and not only do not know the characteristics of the Chinese national spirit; they even reject everything old in China, opposing China's inherent art, thinking it is outdated and backward. The flames of World War II awakened the consciousness of various small and weak nations, and they raised the banner of national liberation one after another, but in China, even after eight years of war against Japan, the degree of awakening of this national consciousness is not very significant, at least the art world is still in a state of semi-sleep. Logically, artists have a keen sense, and the revelation of this consciousness should be particularly strong and become the vanguard of the great era. Fortunately, a few clear-headed writers have realized that blindly learning from the West is no different from being a pawn in Western cultural aggression, and have realized that the situation in which Western painting in China is taking the place of Chinese painting is an abnormal development. If this continues, China's inherent culture will be lost, and they have realized that absorbing foreign cultures should not be swallowed whole, but should be chewed carefully and digested to become their own nourishment and become their own blood. Therefore, they turned back and, relying on their latent national consciousness, restored their efforts in their own position, using the foundation of Western painting to change their style to express the essence of the national spirit. The reason for Mr. Guan Liang's style change may not be as I said. There are more than one reason for the change, and factors such as the times, age, and thought are all related; but the trend of his change is to return to the embrace of the nation and to stand on the post of his own duty. This is a fact—a valuable fact. In his paintings, whether from the perspective of composition, color tone, or brushstrokes, they are full of tranquil, indifferent, and transcendent emotions. Although the materials are Western, the inner essence is full of Chinese style and the consistent spirit of the Chinese nation. Some believe that this is due to the influence of the Impressionist school in the late Western period, but in his paintings, one cannot find the shadows of Cézanne, Gauguin, or Matisse. Nowadays, most art connoisseurs and Western-style painters still maintain the same pace and consistent ideas. Their position is mostly Western. Writers pay attention to the West and imitate the West. Appreciators also like to compare them with Western writers when appreciating the Western-style paintings of Chinese people. This view of losing one's soul and forgetting one's motherland often arouses my potential sadness. Is it true that after the national crisis, one cannot jump out of the shackles of imitation for a lifetime? Will there never be an original writer? I feel that Mr. Guan's painting style is full of creativity. In addition to explaining it with the phrase "the revelation of Chinese nationality," other metaphors are quite far-fetched and boring.</p>
<p>Zhao Xigu, a scholar in the Southern Song Dynasty, once said about painting:</p>
<p>"Hiding ten thousand volumes of poems in one's heart, and having thoroughly viewed the masterpieces of the previous generations, having traveled almost all over the world, then can one pick up the brush. How can this be done by inferior people?"</p>
<p>These few words are quite thought-provoking. Because Mr. Guan likes to travel and enjoy the mountains and rivers, his mind is broad and his brushstrokes are extraordinary. The reason why his works can stand out as a unique style is probably due to this.</p>
<h3>Han Anyi's Oil Paintings</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>It is a pity to say, the new art movement in China has been launched for more than thirty-five years, but relatively scientific oil painting techniques still do not attract much attention and application, and the so-called Chinese art is indeed stagnant on materials such as brushes, ink, and Xuan paper. Of course, artistic creation is not simply tied to materials, but the use of materials will ultimately determine the progress and stagnation of art.</p>
<p>In Western art, oil painting is the main artistic material because it has a high degree of expressive effect, and it also constitutes the main technique of plastic arts. No matter in which country, or which writer, the works that can be listed as important works of art or representative works are always oil paintings. Also, because it can be broken down into complex hues, the Impressionist movement in the second half of the 19th century also used oil painting as its main material to describe the changes in color and light.</p>
<p>Looking back at the progress of the new art movement in our country, oil painting was also popular for a while, but since the War of Resistance, general writers have been forced by material and life threats, and the production and research of oil painting have almost been replaced by Chinese painting. Because Chinese painting can be exchanged for money and solve life problems, although in some places, writers are catering to the psychology of the nouveau riche, the poverty of artists has also been relieved.</p>
<p>Of course, we can also say that Chinese painting is the superior tradition of our culture, and studying Chinese painting is a good trend. However, we rush to embrace the scientific material production of Europe and the United States. Why do we abandon the oil painting techniques and materials that have been scientifically baptized?</p>
<p>Ms. Han Anyi is a young writer who concentrates on the study of oil. She has been quite active in the Shanghai art scene in the past five or six years. Her works have been displayed in the Shanghai Western Painters Joint Exhibition in 1940, the Modern Art Exhibition in 1941, and the Shanghai Art Writers Association Exhibition and Victory Art Exhibition twice last year. In terms of her style, she is only following the correct path after Cézanne in the early 20th century. Therefore, the expression of texture is very solid, and this "Fish" has the characteristics of Trump's new realism. In her many landscape paintings, one can often feel the innocent interest of Henri Rousseau. This is a unique tendency of subjective expression art, and it is also a consistent tendency of modern art.</p>
<p>In the current stage of the Chinese art world, how few people are studying oil painting. Therefore, Ms. Han Anyi's consistent dedication to oil painting is a testament to her artistic sincerity, and we should do everything we can to promote her development and growth. Because: The creation of new art in China will ultimately make oil painting techniques one of the main factors.</p>
<p>It is said that Ms. Han is preparing for a solo exhibition. I will introduce it in advance to attract the attention of art lovers and also to give her some small encouragement.</p>
<h3>Early Morning</h3>
<p>— D. L. Knight</p>
<h3>Formerly, Zheng Wuchang's landscape painting was combined with brocade and given to Lou Peilan. It was lost due to the chaos of war, and after returning to Beijing, it was suddenly found in a desolate stall. Therefore, I requested a re-inscription.</h3>
<p>— Qian Zhixiu</p>
<p>Lord Lou has the vastness of China in his chest, and his passion for good things cannot be matched by anyone. He loves mountains and paintings all his life, and the Yandong factory is full of treasures. I got Zheng Wuchang's travel record, the mountains and rocks are withered and thin, and the mountains are layered upon layers. I hung it on the plain wall of your new residence, and the wind blows through the tall house with a cold rustling sound. When the island barbarians invaded, they wielded sharp spears, and the deer roamed everywhere in the anxious capital. All the officials turned into magpies flying south, and you also bought a boat to go west. Returning, the four walls are empty, but there are dusty cobwebs and spiders. You value me more, and value the painting even more, and laboriously searched the desolate stalls. My eyes suddenly lit up as if I had found an old sword, and my heart was as happy as drinking pure wine. I believe that things gather where they are liked, and events are helped by heaven, not human plans. I was born to entrust things, but things do not stay, and I have long been ashamed of being a cowherd in vain. What is there to do with the cold and tattered green felt? It is but a fleeting cloud passing before my eyes. Why should I care if the Chu bow is obtained by me? And how can the bright pearl be thrown in the dark? I inscribe a poem to repay your earnest intention, but I wish that the friendship of gold and stone will last forever with this painting for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>Answering Lord Jingyu, Rhyming with the Original Poem</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>Remaining mountains and waters tell the story of China, and one corner of Ma Yuan's heart is cast. How could the affectionate scholar Qian value it so much, not losing it like a precious jewel? The smoke and clouds pass before the eyes like idle things, and it can be said that they are cultivated in seclusion with pleasure. Lord Lou has a peerless common interest, and every time we talk about the hills and valleys, the wind rustles. Don't dislike the clumsy scribbles on the barrier, and sit facing each other on the Hu bed, enjoying the scenery. In times of chaos, cultural relics are cheaper than dirt, and the west hunt and east patrol overturned the boat. Where the captive's hooves trampled, there was no complete house, only the remaining human bones and spiders. Returning to the spring city, the grass and trees are deep, why spend so much effort to search for a foot of silk? The relationship with calligraphy and painting may be destined, and getting it is so happy that the wine fills the cup. The rivers and mountains are renewed, and the painting is returned, which is a blessing from heaven, not a human plan. Thank you for loving me more than Liang Qianwei, but I am ashamed that my hand is not as good as Gu Hutou. How can I travel all over the Five Sacred Mountains and follow the raft to float on the four seas? I will write down thousands of strange and wonderful pictures and throw them all on the walls of the noble and bright. The small gains and losses cause joy and sorrow, and the friendship is testified on paper for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 166</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Mr. W, in performing his duties and in punishing his subordinates, has a heart that is as hard as steel. However, after hearing me recite these few sentences, he was already gnashing his teeth, and it looked like he was extremely angry, and a circle of redness had already appeared around his eyes. At this time, he was looking at me, meaning to let me read the letter down:</p>
<p>"According to Mr. Shen, my wife and two daughters committed suicide by hanging themselves, fearing that they would be trampled on by beasts. They died very cleanly, which can slightly comfort my heart; because although they died a violent death, it is still better than the more than one hundred innocent women in Changxindian who were raped by Japanese invaders and wanted to die but could not! Mr. Shen also said that the corpses of my wife and two daughters had several gunshot wounds and knife wounds, but there was not much bleeding, presumably the wounds were inflicted after they were already dead. What hatred do the enemy beasts have? They must want to mutilate the corpses? Are they angry that they did not kill them earlier and did not satisfy their bestial desires? I heard that the deaths of the two daughters were extremely tragic. They each had several knife wounds and their limbs were also torn apart. Their fingernails were curled up, and there were broken hairs and pieces of cloth left behind. It must have been that before they died, they fought bravely with the bandits to defend their flesh and blood. The bandits were many and also possessed sharp weapons. The two daughters were young and weak, but they dared to provoke the bandits' anger. They had already embraced the determination to die. The youngest daughter, Dingxiang, was only eight years old and weak. Mr. Shen said that her clothes had almost been stripped off, and there were fingernail scratches on her lower abdomen. Her eyes were wide open, and she died from excessive fright. It was also tragic. Of the whole family of seven, I am the only one left alive. What is the point of living? I have attempted suicide several times, but I was rescued by doctors and nurses. Mr. Shen said that I should reluctantly keep the remaining breath and sacrifice myself to serve the country. If the country wins, then there will be a day to avenge my family. His words are sincere and heroic, but I am in so much pain from this change that my mind is weak and my heart is sick. How can I ride a horse and kill the bandits? I heard that the bandits have already entered the city. Rather than sit and wait for death, it is better to break into the bandits' camp and make a desperate gamble with the pistol borrowed from Mr. Shen. If my wife and children have knowledge of their deaths, they will surely help me kill more bandits. Farewell, my brother. If what the Buddha said is not false, I will repay you in the next life. Your younger brother, Dingyuan, bows his head."</p>
<p>"Alas!" The four people sighed in unison after hearing me read the letter.</p>
<p>After sighing, I looked at everyone and saw that their expressions all contained a surge of anger, a ball of resentment, mixed with infinite sadness. This emotional impulse and agitation created an extremely low pressure in the room. Silence, silence, silence for more than three minutes.</p>
<p>"It's almost five-thirty." Mr. W looked at his watch, his voice a little hoarse.</p>
<p>"I support the plan for tonight's raid!" He Jian felt that his nerves were overly strained and a little tired. He picked up a chair and sat down facing Mr. W. "But…" He pondered for a moment, "But I have a little contribution. From my point of view—of course, I have not yet heard your raid deployment—I think that even if it is a raid, there is no need to be overly adventurous; excessive risk will inevitably lead to great sacrifices…"</p>
<p>"That's right!" Mr. W nodded constantly.</p>
<p>"I think the Japanese army's strength is very strong in the city and suburbs now. According to the information at noon, seventy or eighty percent of the country's regular army has been moved south of Changxindian; the remaining twenty or thirty percent are surrounded and are being depleted. This can explain the strength situation on both sides. To put it more thoroughly, the potential for special agents in our part has reached a period where they should be lurking deeper and more secretly!…" He Jian was implying that Mr. W and his subordinates should from now on change to "underground work."</p>
<p>"That's right!" Mr. W expressed his strong agreement with He Jian's analysis. The few of us all nodded silently.</p>
<p>"From this point of view, there is nothing wrong with the raid; but we must also consider the consequences of the raid: for example, how we will handle the aftermath after the raid. I grew up in Japan and have also been in the Japanese army until I was twenty-six or twenty-seven years old this year. I know that Japanese soldiers, especially the soldiers in this area, are all rascals!…"</p>
<p>When we heard this, we not only tacitly agreed that He Jian's words were correct, but we almost wanted to applaud and cheer if we were not afraid of disrupting this sacred tension and disturbing He Jian's thoughts.</p>

<h3>A Trivial Account 1946 Various Aspects of America, Brevity</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi Shi from the English Great American Evening News</p>
<p>The news figures of America in 1946 were: miners' leader Lewis, former Secretary of State Byrnes, Republican leader Taft, automobile tycoon Henry Ford II, playwright O'Neill, comedian Bob Hope, and baseball star Ted Williams.</p>
<p>Seven News Figures</p>
<p>Lewis ranked first among the seven news figures. His two leaderships of coal miners' strikes not only affected every American family, but also most European countries. The first major strike was in April, and the second was in November. Both strikes hindered America's "reconversion" plan, increased unemployment, and forced the entire nation to greatly conserve electricity and heat. The first strike ended with the federal government taking over the coal mines, and the second strike resulted in a court fining Lewis $10,000 and the union $3.5 million. Lewis ordered the workers to return to work during the appeal period. These two major strikes made Lewis the number one news figure in America in 1946.</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Byrnes was the second news figure. Throughout the year, Byrnes represented the United States at various international conferences, large and small. He was the spokesman for bipartisan foreign policy, and the departure of Wallace further enhanced Byrnes' prestige. Byrnes played a most active role in the two United Nations meetings held in London and New York, the two meetings of the four foreign ministers, the United Nations Security Council meetings, and the Paris Peace Conference, making him the second news figure.</p>
<p>The third news figure was Taft, who was a former Republican presidential candidate. The Republican victory in November increased his importance. He is highly likely to be the Republican presidential candidate in 1948 and also highly likely to be the next president of the United States. He strongly criticized American domestic policy, advocating that the government should adopt a tough labor policy, but opposed banning strikes.</p>
<p>Automobile tycoon Henry Ford II is the grandson of old Ford. At the age of 29 this year, his automobile factory occupies a very important position in the American reconversion plan. He only began to take over the Ford factory in 1945. After taking power, he fired several senior executives. In 1946, his position was extremely solid, making him an outstanding figure in the American industrial sector.</p>
<p>Eugene O'Neill's play "The Iceman Cometh" was written in 1939, but it was not staged on Broadway until last year. It was O'Neill's first play since 1934, and it was extremely successful. Comedian Bob Hope and baseball star Ted Williams were also news figures that Americans paid attention to.</p>
<p>In addition to these major national news stories, many interesting small news stories emerged in America last year:</p>
<p>Minor, Laughable Events</p>
<p>In January, a thief in Boling saw an old woman at a tram stop waiting for a tram, carrying a heavy, full leather bag. He hurried forward to offer his assistance, wanting to carry the bag for the old woman. As soon as the bag was in his hand, the thief took off running, disappearing in an instant. It was just a pity that he didn't know that the bag contained the old woman's dead dog, which she was about to bury.</p>
<p>In February, a discharged soldier returned to his hometown in Sparta, wanting to surprise his family. He sneaked into the house in the middle of the night, ran into his parents' bedroom, turned on the lights, and shouted, "Guess who's here?" Two young people stuck their heads out of the bed, roaring and standing up. It turned out to be two strangers; his parents had already moved.</p>
<p>In March, a female performer in Chicago had to join the local musicians' union in order to play eight notes on the piano in a play. A man in California had to go to the hospital for a cup of coffee: because the coffee was too hot, he drank it too quickly, choked, and knocked out a set of dentures, cutting his lips. He was shocked and fell off the chair, hitting his head on the corner of the table, tearing a seam in his ear.</p>
<p>In April, the zoo in Biborough had to install more fences, because visitors liked to touch the lions in the cages. A prankster in New York State sent many letters to many people, saying that he had many trained monkeys for sale that could be bought as servants, and surprisingly, many people wrote back wanting to buy them.</p>
<p>In May, the Treasury Department wanted to return an overpayment of $22 in taxes to a sailor. In a moment of carelessness, they sent a check for $555,550.55. In Boston, two policemen desperately chased a person, chasing them for two blocks before realizing that they didn't know why they were chasing that person, and the person being chased didn't know why they were being chased.</p>
<p>In June, a landlord wanted to force his tenant to move out and split the roof of the house with an ax. A passenger argued with a tram driver and lay down on the tram tracks, refusing to move.</p>
<p>In July, a husband chartered an airplane, flew to his wife's parents' home in Oregon, and dropped a letter tied to a stone, which said: "Come home quickly, many things need washing."</p>
<p>Duck Bites People, Also News</p>
<p>In August, a person was bitten by a duck, so he took a reporter to see the duck that would bite people, and the duck bit him again.</p>
<p>In September, a butcher's assistant wrapped a large piece of bacon and placed it on the counter. A lady and a male customer came to grab it together. The lady grabbed it and heavily knocked the bacon on the male customer's head, saying, "Pleased to Meat You"!</p>
<p>In October, a drummer in a Chicago band was very angry because the band conductor invented a machine to hit the drums, so he also tried his best to invent an automatic baton. Two escaped prisoners in New Jersey ran to the highway and were lucky enough to flag down a car, quickly jumping in. Unfortunately, they didn't notice that the car was full of prison guards.</p>
<p>In November, a man walking with crutches staggered into a bar in San Francisco, drank a few drinks, paid, and turned around, breaking the leg of an eleven-year-old child. While he was rolling around in bed, he broke his other leg as well.</p>
<p>In December, a wife in Manna filed for divorce from her husband because her husband suffered from chronic laziness and had not gotten out of bed for seven years. Another wife in Washington also filed for divorce because her husband would not allow her to play popular song records.</p>
<p>These news stories quietly passed away with 1946, and then came 1947.</p>
<h3>Carefree Glimpses of Children, Not by the Plum, Then by the Willow</h3>

<p>The Reason for the Blue Color of Seawater</p>
<p>A long-unresolved problem has received new reports in the war researching and attempting to use light to combat submarines.</p>
<p>In attempting to find a way to resist German submarines, two American scientists discovered that there are 1.5 million dust-like particles in every cubic inch of seawater, each particle having a diameter of about one fifty-millionth of an inch. These particles can reflect sunlight to the surface of the sea. However, the light is filtered when it is reflected to the surface of the water. Water absorbs red and yellow light, leaving green, blue, and purple light, which mixes to form the indigo color of seawater.</p>
<p>The Almighty Aircraft L-13</p>
<p>Military communication aircraft can be described as a type of almighty aircraft.</p>
<p>Equipped with foldable wings and adjustable landing wheels, it can be towed by a military vehicle on uneven ground or loaded onto a truck. By replacing the landing wheels with sleds, it can land on snow. Or equipped with floats, it can be launched from harbor bases. Without removing the propeller, it can be towed up by another aircraft, like a glider, and then use its own power.</p>
<p>It can take off in 230 feet and land in 227 feet at 43 and a half miles per hour. The entire body is metal, and the wingspan is 40 and a half feet. Its name is L-13. (Translated from the February issue of Scientific Digest.)</p>
<h3>A Soul-Stirring Night of Hexagonal Romance</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Due to fierce competition among peers, Hollywood today seems to be popularizing grand performances with "several headliners performing at the same time." "Night of Ecstasy," which will be released at the Majestic Theater following "Since You Left," is one of the new films completed by Universal Pictures under this policy.</p>
<p>In "Night of Ecstasy," there are two male and female leads. Susanna Foster is the latest work of Louise Albritton, the female lead in "Phantom of the Opera." David Bruce, the male lead, we recently saw in "Can't Help Singing." Franchot Tone is even more familiar to the public. With these four collaborating on a film, the results should not be disappointing.</p>
<p>This is a musical comedy. Foster started as a singer, and in this film, she plays a café clerk who has a very eager "stage fever." She is eager to get on stage, even ignoring the love of the shop owner. Later, in her eagerness to get on stage, she went to a famous theater authority, claiming to be the daughter born to his divorced wife. He knew it was fake, but was bewitched by her beauty and expressed his love. However, this authority also has his lover. Seeing his lover being touched, unwilling to give in, he tried to find the divorced wife, wanting to prove that the daughter was fake. However, this divorced wife had a role to play, making the fake seem real. The authority rekindled his old feelings and wanted to relive the old days, but coincidentally, the former's current husband also heard the news and rushed over. This situation became extremely complicated. In the end, naturally, the three pairs of lovers each formed their own families, and Foster's dream of getting on stage was also realized. Hollywood filmmakers often like to use this kind of intricate relationship to create laughter. If this arrangement can be used effectively, it can indeed increase a lot of comedic effect.</p>
<p>Old comedian Mischa Auer also participates in this film, maintaining his consistent deadpan style. He plays a waiter in a food shop, but has a problem of not being able to "see food." This may cause a lot of jokes.</p>
<p>Tired of leg shows, a lighthearted comedy can also adjust your spirits.</p>
