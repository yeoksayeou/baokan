<h3>調整待遇新標準　京滬平津等區公敎人員　基數卅四萬倍數千八百</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕公報人員及武職官兵生活補助費調整辦法，業經十三日政務會議中通過，自本月份起實行；府委會議核定後即付實施。據政院某氏談，此次公敎人員待遇調整標準爲百分之八十五，乃衡量國庫負担能力，參照各地物價指數斟酌擬訂，同時去年十二月調整待遇時，以上海爲例，物價指數爲戰前之八千二百倍，本年四月份爲一萬五千倍，約增加百分之八十許，故調整標準即確定增加百分之八十五。茲擇舉調整要點如下：（一）基本數較過去調整增加之比例爲大，加倍數增加之比例則較小，基本數之增加最少爲一倍，多者一倍以上，如此可使低級人員收入比例較大，如月薪二百元以下人員，最少增加八成五，多者至九成，高級人員增加比例較小，如月薪八百元之特任官僅增七成。（二）各區地域，參照各該當地物價情形，重加調整，以期適應實際。如鎭江。杭州。靑島。濟南·太原等地，原列入二區者，現提高至一區，嘉興·武漢·廣州·長沙·福州等地原列三區者，現提高至二區，柳州原在四區者，現提高至三區。</p>
<h3>調整官兵待遇　由國防部核定</h3>
<p>武職官兵生活補助費之調整，則由國庫增撥經費，依照向例，交由國防部統籌核定。此次調整對國庫負担增加頗鉅，計文職人員每月國庫負担共增一二五〇億元，武職人員每月國庫負担共增一七五〇億元。兩項共計，每月共增加國庫負祖達三千億元。茲將調整公教人員生活補助費支給標準數誌之如次：第一區即京，滬，平，津，杭，靑，濟，幷，基本數三十四萬，加倍數一八〇〇，第二區蘇，錫嘉與，武漢，廣州，長沙，福州，基本數廿九萬，加倍數一六〇〇，第三區昆明，柳州，基本數廿四萬，加倍數一三〇〇倍，第四區重慶，基本數廿萬，加倍數一〇〇〇，第五區貴州，基本數十七萬，加倍數八〇〇。</p>
<p>〔附註〕（一）警長支基本數七成，警士支六成，並支加倍數，（二）公役支基本數六成，（三）東北九省，按本表標準計算國幣，再折合流通券支給，（四）台灣，未列入。</p>

<h3>關於運動會的幾個基本問題</h3>
<p>— 周尙</p>
<p>第七屆全國運動會定於今年雙十節，在滬舉行，現正在積極籌備之中。原振在京舉行，預算百億，在戰後瘡　未復，百事待舉之秋，加之經濟將瀕破產的邊綠，一切都在勒緊肚帶度日，那裏有這筆鉅大閒錢，自然，當局本不贊成，旋以應付來年的世界運動會，非用全運會無從選拔選手，於是改在上海，想收些門票，挹注開銷。</p>
<p>這次全運曾的動機，原在應付世運，講起我國參加世運。確有感慨糸之的一段痛史。前事不忘後事之師，我們還該痛定思痛。世界運動會原名夏令匹克運動會，創始於二千七百十餘年前的古希臘，因當時希臘四境皆爲敵人，政府人民受强鄰的壓迫，爲防衛計，極力提倡武道，以養成耐勞勇敢戰鬥的精神。翻開希臘的敎育史，體育與音樂兩大科目則眩耀我們眼簾。正如我們往昔商周以來，序序敎育胥重禮業射御。希臘的音樂屬於智育，藉此陶冶人民愛國心宗敎心，以英雄　傑的言行譜入樂典而敎之，然而單靠音樂猶不足以禦侮，復以體育鍛鍊國民身體，於是運動會變了表現國民健康的成績，以資惕勵。</p>
<p>運動節目有　跑，跳高，　槍，　盤（當時以金屬或石頭製成，即今之娜鐵餅）和角力。這五項競賽變成了有名的五項運動，這是夏令匹克運動區中頂重要的事情，因爲一個人能　表現這五項運動的優越，他便是各種運動的能手。這些運動對於希臘是很重要的，每四年來一回，在兩次夏令匹克董技大會間的四年期間，呌做「四年紀一，參加夏令匹克運動的人員，規定極嚴，旣須希臘純血統上國民，復須未違犯宗敎及國家者爲先決條件，所有選手，須能長時期的苦練。許多靑年在競技塲跑道上夢想夏令匹克中勝利而使他頭額上獲得野橄欖花冠的榮譽報酬。</p>
<p>今日的世運會即濫觴於夏令匹克，可惜年久弊生，遂被羅馬敎皇於紀元後三九四年下令停止。迨至一八九二年，法國硏究希臘文獻專家古巴丁氏鑒於古代夏令匹克對文化具有特殊貢獻，登高一呼，使中斷的運動會於一八九六年復活，於是遵循古例繼續不斷。第十一屆在一九三六年柏林舉行，我國應邀參加，不惜發廿萬鉅款，遺派大隊人馬浩浩蕩蕩作第一次萬里長征。</p>
<p>參加柏林世運會的一三九個代表，悽慘地全軍覆沒，不要說各種男女賽跑國內赫赫有名的大將均被淘汰，即是著名的籃球連得秘魯也無法頡　。據報吿我們有廿四回罰球的機會，請我們穩穩不動的靜立投球，誰料一次未中。這裏便說出我們體力的不如人，而且神經上也不安定不健全！</p>
<p>新貴乎有運動會者，可在蔣主席六　全運會的訓詞　得全豹。他說：「運動之目的，在求各個人心身平均之發展，以造　　全之體格，强毅之精神。競賽之目的，在求於有規律的動作之中，以養成守規律，尙合作及勇取服從諸種之德性。……應淬勵全體國民之進步，復興民族之基本工作…今後民族復興之大業，即應於運動中建立其基礎」。蘇聯運動會即大衆的體育表演，目的在軍事準備，增加紅軍新兵的身長體重。他們還承認「大衆體育訓練，即大衆政治訓練」。無怪上屆的「體育日」，莫斯科運動會斯太林和莫洛託夫在五〇，〇〇〇人民前帶領了十六個蘇維埃共和國五，〇〇〇男女舉行集體柔軟體操，給世界上看他們身體的健康。</p>
<p>看了今古中外的運動敎訓，我們要提出幾個基本問題，警惕大家：（一）運動目的，在鍛鍊身體，培養自衛國家的力量；（二）要培養運動風氣，社會公民，學校學生都具有日常運動的習惯（三）不能一日曝之十日寒之，社會上必須多多供給運動的環境，京滬等已有的運動塲應該天天運用天天滿塲人山人海，怎可棄之如敝展，讓他榛莽荒毀，草長得像人樣的高，鐵鎖銹得不能開（四）學校該有合格的運動塲，將來該有體育館游泳池，寗可少幾個敎室，運動空間不能沒有，寗可少幾本書，運動設備不可不備。運動不及格還是不畢業（五）體育師資體育督導，快快要大量培植，而且師範畢業生，必須人人能充體育敎師。</p>
<p>目前運動會底層的基礎工作大成問題，連得敎育部體育委會的計劃，因沒有經費而擱淺，那末我們該不該再做勞民傷財的表面裝飾？世運要全運產生，全運靠各地運動會產生，還加上訓練與複選等手續，這一串活動的經費，恰是可觀，恐非二百億不辦，是不是該省下些經費多辦些體育師資訓練，增添些體音塲館游泳池和設備等，切切實實做幾年國民生活基礎的事業，然後出席世運會亦不為晚？若平時一無準備，臨時抱佛脚，以疲　殘疾的身燈，再演一次全軍覆沒的悲劇，勢將由創鉅痛深而成「血潰膿崩」。豈非爲了面子，反被面子所累而丟盡面子，道又何苦。世運會是各國國力的表演塲，實在不能不脚踏實地痛下功夫。這不獨對世運動會言，國族前途亦以此是賴。</p>

<h3>社會黨反對擴大政府　義大利政潮爆發　加斯貝利內閣提總辭呈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：義社會黨與蒸督教民主黨對聯合政府骨潰之責任問題互相指摘之際，總理加斯貝利今日突向臨時總統尼古拉提出辭呈。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：義大利公共工程部長羅米他宣稱，首相加斯貝利及內閣將於本日提出辭呈。羅氏在非常內閣會議散會後吿記者稱，加斯貝利因社會黨指責渠有意造成政治危機，已具辭職決心。義政府已因意見紛歧而吿崩潰，其最大原因爲國債問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十三日電〕義大利總理加斯貝利今日已提出辭呈。加斯貝利爲基督民主黨領袖，一九四五年十二月來任聯合內閣之總理，渠最近曾赴美一行，冀能獲得更多之經濟上之支助，以及减輕義國和約之負担。加斯貝利於今晨向總統表示辭意，在召開內閣緊急會議後，即向義總統提出渠個人以及全體內閣之辭呈。內閣總辭之起因，乃爲社會黨不贊同加斯貝利請所有政黨參加以擴大內閣之計劃，社會黨本身願與共黨合併，加斯貝利之基督民主黨黨內又攻擊加氏之柔弱，不能擺脫共黨。</p>
<p>種種跡象顯示美國企圖削弱義國內左派之力量，美駐義大使却聲明：「美國從未對加斯貝利有任何建議，加氏亦從未向美國微詢任何意見。」然僉信加氏訪美與杜魯門總統與美高級官員會談後，已決定欲組織擯斥共黨之政府。</p>
<h3>英申明對希立塲　駐希軍隊現暫不撤退　美戰具絡續海運至希</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫教十二日電〕外交部發言人今日聲稱，美國會核准援助希臘法案，非謂駐希英軍全部即將自動撤退，此兩問題不必彼此關聯。英國僅擬於七月間自希臘召回經濟代表團，惟根據英希協定，英陸海空軍代表人員一千二百名仍將留駐希臘，繼續訓練希臘軍隊。現駐希臘其他英軍何時「完成任務」，尙不可知。英國贊成希臘大赦政治犯，同時須顧及其內部安全。但英政府認爲，向希臘政府建議將所拘政治犯實行大赦，是否屬於聯合國巴爾幹調査委會職權範圍之內，不能無疑。</p>

<h3>希反共法案　提國會討論</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雅典十二日電〕國民議會今日開會，議員三十人在副理江那達斯領袖之下，提出將希臘共黨視爲非法之法案，並指出共激以暴力推翻政府爲其黨綱，故屬危售國家利益之政黨。自由黨議員表示反對，認爲議員無提出重要法案之權，外長蔡爾達里斯則認爲議員有提出任何措施之權。惟右派議員所提出之該項法案，乃與美大使館之見解相抵觸，蓋大使館認爲將共黨迫成地下政黨反足增强其反對勢力，且美國所擁護之政府雖欲加入西方民主國家，而實際行動將屬反民主性質故也。國會觀察家相信，今國會提出此項法案，殆欲在美代表團到達希臘之前，先制定反共之强便措施。</p>
<h3>美援助希土案　最後立法程序</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕美援助希土法案，已於今口交參衆兩院聯會作最後審査。該案已於星期五經衆院通過，惟參院則認衆院通過該案之內容，與參院通過之內容不同，拒絕接受衆院通過之內容。今日開會之目的，即在使兩者趨於調和。査兩者間主要不同點，僅爲衆院案中已删除該案序論章內對於一般政策之宣示，以及美國派往希土使命團團長之任命，須經參院批准之一項規定，故料討論之際，當不致有若何困難發生也。　〔法國新聞社華盛頓十二日電〕消息靈通人士頃宣稱：杜魯門總統或將於明日午後簽署援助希土二國法案。</p>
<h3>韓國問題臨重要修階段　美向蘇再提照會　談判能否恢復胥視蘇方答覆</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕美國駐蘇大使館本日奉命向蘇聯政府提出關於朝鮮美蘇聯合委員會恢復進行之新照會一件。國務院發言人稱：此項新照會係答復五月八日蘇外長莫洛托夫之照會，而莫洛托夫之照會則爲答覆五月二日國務卿馬歇爾之照會，其內容爲關於美蘇委員會恢復進行之玆礎，以便設立美蘇兩軍佔領區之朝鮮臨時政府。發言人對於此等照會，不願發表批評，僅稱：美國之新照會要求對方予以答覆。馬歇爾五月二日之照會爲有關美蘇聯合委員會任務之第三次照會，槪述美國對於莫斯科協定關於朝鮮問題之解釋。馬歇爾說明美政府之立塲，謂委員會討論朝鮮臨時政府時，不應拒絕朝鮮各民主政黨及社會機構代表參加協商。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日第三次照會蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，要求先行協商條件，然後恢復美蘇聯合委員會工作。照會全文暫未公布，但官員聲稱，除非接獲滿意答復，否則五月廿日在漢城恢復談判之準備工作將吿擱淺。</p>

<h3>美國務院要員　或將續有更動　勃蘭登及彭頓亦有辭職可能</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十二日電〕白宮新聞秘書羅斯頃向報界宣稱：國務副卿艾克遜呈請辭職，業經杜魯門總統批准，總統擬於短期內向參院提出陸軍部前任帮辦羅維特爲國務副卿之繼任人選。艾克遜辭職將於六月卅日開始生效。據消息靈通人士談稱：國務帮辦勃蘭登及彭頓亦將呈請辭職，頗屬可能，按國會對於勃蘭登及彭頓二氏，最近均曾加以嚴厲批評，認爲前者對於阿根廷所採取之政策過於堅定，後者則處理國務院之情報及宣傳工作有所失當。艾克遜係素來支持勃蘭登者，而今辭職之後，勃蘭登之地位，勢將削弱，尤其是羅維特對於南美各國之政策與勃蘭登逈異，故其地位將更見削弱。艾克遜於一九四一年入國務院任帮辦之職，於一九四五年八月十六日由前任國務卿貝爾納斯任命爲國務副卿，在故總統羅斯福逝世之後，對於貝爾納斯政策及杜魯門主義維護甚力，即對於馬歇爾國務卿之受國會攻擊亦竭力聲辨，故其所處地位，甚爲重要，負責爲其上司聲辨即爲艾氏之主要職業，蓋因重要決定均由貝爾納斯，杜魯門及馬歇爾所採取，而艾氏並無決定任何政策之權力故也。艾克遜口齒流利，言詞懇切，曾迭次列席參院及衆院外交委員會，爲貸款英國或對希土兩國貸款，竭力聲辨，對於國務院功勞殊大。據此問人士稱：目前尙需等候羅維特列席參院及衆院外交委員會，俾確定其受任國務副卿之職以後，是否繼續其前任者之傳統。美國政府向有要職留給軍人或熟諳軍事之人士之傾向，但今若任命羅維特爲國務副卿，似將打破此種傾向，良以羅氏爲一銀行家故也。美國之自由少數派，因軍人担任國內外要職者爲數過多，曾對政府當局屢有批評云。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦獨立問題　不列入調查會議程　聯大政委會通過法建議</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖十二日電〕聯大政委會本日投票表決，在對特別委會調査巴勒斯坦糾紛之訓令中，删除有關巴勒斯坦獨立之規定。按此案係法國所提出。在表決之前，若干發言人即指出此一問題在前此對調査委會之調令成立協議時，早已有所規定，即授與該委會「以最大權力，辨認事實眞相，調查一切有關巴勒斯坦之問題與議案」，表決結果，贊成删除者有廿九國，反對者十四國，叧十國棄權，二國缺席。在五强中，僅蘇聯投反對票。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十二日電〕聯大政委會，表決巴勒斯坦事實調査委會避免論及獨立一事，此即阿拉伯集團失敗之謂，即爲猶太公會之勝利。當時曾引起激辯，阿猶雙方發言人互以惡詞相向。　〔合衆社明那波利斯十二日電〕美國前商務部長華萊士頃在無黨無派選民協會歡宴席上發表演說稱：全國反共會議實屬一種恥辱，杜魯門總統考騐政府官員忠誠一事，亦非應當之措施，共產黨理應同樣視之為人類，不應下於獄中，加以監禁。余最近至歐洲遊歷，發現各地事事公開，各國亦有健全之政治氣候，故余以爲美國亦應如此。華萊士繼表示美國倘能織讀自由讓動，則膩參加總統競遷。</p>

<h3>日組閣尙多困難　彼岸黨不滿社會黨經濟政策　新相人選為最大癥結</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十三日電〕十三日午前，自由黨舉行幹部會議，就十二日四黨幹事長會談情形，加以檢討。關於社會黨所提出經濟危機緊急突破策，認爲係社會黨一方面根據社會主義之方案，尙須另擬訂與自由黨較爲接近之提案，始可進行磋商。關於閣僚分配比率，社會黨西尾幹事長之提議乃社會黨得首相，大藏，　林·運輸·厚生等五相，自由黨得內務，司法，商工及不管部兩席，民主黨得外交。遞信及不管部三席，國民協同然得文相。同時西尾書記長提出內閣官房長官及法制局長官兩職，應由首相就社會黨內任命之。當時大野幹事長對此即喚起西尾應注意組織聯合內閣之態度。按本日幹部會議中又無決議。</p>

<h3>交大二千學生車抵眞如　敎育部長深夜趕往勸阻　政府已接受全部要求但學生仍谷晉京　北車站鎭日紛擾兩路旅客被阻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國立交通大學學生二千餘人，爲反對教部更改校名及停辦航管輪機兩科事，昨日發動大規模晋京請願運動，淸晨八時，學生即分登四十八輛大卡車，駛往北站。吳市長聞悉後，於事前趕抵該校，竭力勸阻無效，敎部田次長培林，亦於同時趕抵交大，與吳校長會晤，並召集李敎務長，谷院院長，各系科主任，及全體敎授副敎授，舉行會議，到八十餘人。除吳市長國楨外，潘議長公展，方主委治，趙局長曾珏，顧局長毓琇等，亦被邀蒞校會商，田氏當代表朱部長對該校學生所提要求，作下列肯定之答復：（一）交大決不改名，並決不停辦任何院系科。（二）輪機科併入造船系，造船系改稱造船輪機系，仍屬工學院，航海科改爲航海管理系，屬管理學院。（三）學校經費依照實際需要增加，與其他大學平等。（四）員工名額，按班級及人數，照章增加。（五）如有未盡事宜，師生及校友可派代表晋京面商。以上各條，由田次長吳校長會同簽字，出席各人亦均簽署，並請吳市長潘議長方主委趙局長顧局長五人聯署作證，以昭鄭重。惟此時該校學生，仍集北站候車準備晋京。吳市長等乃即趕至車站勸導，並由吳校長用書面及口頭報吿田次長所答覆五項辦法，力勸學生回校。同時北站方面，亦已接得南京電報，謂朱部長決偕交部凌次長鴻勛由京乘專機飛滬，約下午二時許可抵達。吳市長等勸導學生推出代表偕同往見朱部長，詎學生堅拒推舉代表，仍繼續在車站等候，要求朱部長蒞站。路局上午九時第六次車，十一時第八次特快車，以及一時半金陵號快車雖均仍得設法由滬開出。以後各次列車均被阻。</p>

<h3>學生開車　接軌前進</h3>
<p>學生乃相學登車，由學生逕行駕駛機車，離北站前進。本市各負責當局，爲恐事態擴大，乃一面請路局通知學生前面已有拆除路軌一節，希望學生勿自動開車前進，一面爲防萬一計，由宣司令下令警戒，並將全部候車之旅客送出車站，北站內外實行全部戒嚴。移時，靑年軍二〇二師第四團團長李均，率領該團第二營全體官兵抵站，同時警局保警隊，北站憲兵連等，均已抵站，分別執行警戒任務。並由靑年軍第二營搭專車，趕往麥根路車站附近勸阻前進。時已下午七時矣。迨九時許，吳校長吳市長潘議長方主委及交大校友凌次長鴻勳，趙局長祖康，趙局長曾鈺，及敎授等復先後趕赴麥根路車站，苦口勸導，舌敝唇焦，校友會並特備公用局客車數十輛，以便接回學生，同時由吳校長將印就之布吿二千張分別散發，使學生均能明瞭內容，可有最後之考慮。但學生終以羣龍無首，仍未接納勸吿，並將所拆路軌裝接、繼續開駛，至午後十二時，列車已駛抵眞如附近。路局方面則將眞如以西之路軌拆除，以阻列車繼續前進。吳市長等多人乃復離麥根路站至中央硏究院，就商於朱部長。朱部長謂校長已有嚴正布吿，自應照辦，惟學生自動駕車駛至眞如，極表關切，特於深晚一時半，乘車趕往眞如，向學生訓話，勸導回滬，但截至發稿時止，學生仍未有回校之象。</p>

<p>華股昨以電訊復工，銀根轉鬆，人心重振。四行兩局於午後果吿差出，掀起漲風，漲停者達十之九。美亞暗市加千元，信和五十元，新光四元，均多成交。晨開雖低，但較前收暗盤則已回振。良以銀根略平，遞永紗開後五五號一四八號二三二號一八六號六一號二三一號一四三號俱進，開後步升至五一〇〇元。二三七號一〇五號二三一號一五二號一八六號一五四號九四號四號進胃仍殷，升至五一四〇元。五四號三六號脫手，退爲五〇四〇元。一七號一八九號一七一號四號一四五號二三一號九一號買胃，美亞增資有新方案，首先漲停。景福大通亦迫停限有成交。一五四號二一九號出後亦進，而漲到五三一〇元。二三一號七六號二〇二號一六五號逢高供售而吿回，九一號一〇五號三六號四八號一七一號爭售，港申軍回長至十九元外，急切慘瀉至四七〇〇元。九一號一九七號一五二號二三〇號乘低補進，升爲四九五〇元。一七一號　仍售，午收乃恍惚而微怯，收後迫低至四七五〇元。</p>
<p>結果較前收計美亞漲停，永紗平平，信和勤興微升，新華景福新光各漲半成，永公買戶失望，獨跌半成。遞交計永紗景福微降，美亞漲停後稍回，升半成强。氷公跌半成，新光升半成，勤興微升，冷股大通中絲水泥漲停後有回，計水泥升一成外，前者微升，商務平平，新亞景綸徵升，火柴微降。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>銀根鬆，工潮止，人心見好。一七一號九七號六九號一一二號七六號一六〇號四八號二二二四號八五號四號一八三號均進，五和跌停外，美亞中絲新光則先漲停。遞永紗即盤升至五一九〇元。七六號八七號五四號二一五號趁高供給，退至五一〇〇元。七六號八五號四號一四二號二〇五號一八〇號二三一號六一號連袂購納，景福水泥信和新華再吿漲停，四行兩局差出三百餘億，盤漲到五三五〇元。三五號二三五號二二三號雖供而稍盤，火柴商務勤興景綸統益大通新亞再吿漲停。二二四號八九號六〇號一一二號四八號一五五號一〇六號一一七號等均來吸納，遞永紗乃迫近漲限，一五二號二二八號脫手，臨收稍回，收後略有喊低。結果較前收計信和美亞新光景　勤興新華漲停，永紗升一成，永公升一成弱，遞交計美亞新光景福勤興信和漲停，永紗升一成弱，永公升半成强。冷股中紡統益大通中絲商務火柴景綸水泥新亞一漲達限度，業豐微升，五和跌停後有回，塲外吿股雖見低落，但已有買盤。麗安新股定十五日上午起恢復賣買，成交單位定一萬股。</p>
<h3>統債回漲</h3>
<p>公俊昨見回振，統丙自晨開一二一〇〇元開後三六〇室雖售，五〇三室及潤德則進，乃盤高至一四四〇〇元結束，結果較前收計甲乙升一千四，統丙漲二千二，丁種升一千六，戊種亦好起一千元，成交約七百萬。午後塲外喊高至一五五〇〇元左右。</p>

<h3>茶市了無生氣</h3>
<p>沉悶已久之洋莊茶市，昨日市上因買戶胃納依然滯塞，致市勢續呆，缺少實際做開。瞻觀前途，岌岌可危。至于專供內銷之紅綠茶，過程仍趨平定，蓋以雙方授受相埒，人心甚少波動，行情多與隔日相仿。</p>
<h3>實施公敎人員等配米　社局正儘速準備中　昨到米不多喊價又見挺昇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕當局自決定對本市私立大中小學敎職員，公私立大中學寄宿生，各廠職工及貧民等按月定量配給食米後，社會局已自十二日起停止於市塲每日拋售九千包白粳。各學校工廠申請配米之名册格式，社會局將於今日各報公佈。各學校工廠即可按照該項格式，造表具呈社會局。吳開先氏承認在拋米停止，而配米尙未實施前之一段時間內，恐米價有所波動，故社會局正儘速準備配米中。因時間急迫，恐不待糧食都之公事到達即實施配售。　昨北市塲到貨二九九七石半，南市塲到貨八八七石。喊價較前日挺昇，南市且較北市爲高。白粳高貨卅一萬元，中貨卅萬五千元，次貨卅萬元。薄稻高貨卅萬五千元，中貨卅萬元，次貨廿九萬五千元。早稻高貨廿九萬三千元，中貨廿九萬元，次貨廿八萬五千元。羊秈高貨卅萬元，中貨廿九萬五千元。白元高貨卅一萬元，中貨卅萬元，次貨廿九萬元。陰元高貨卅萬五千元，中貨廿九萬四千元。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日全市米店二千餘家，均已照常營業。大多添補，以應門市，來源尙未見湧，市况緊悄。</p>
<p>粉市先堅後回，微漲千元。麩皮實銷尙濃，價升千餘元。油餅雜糧相繼下降。豆餅交涉甚懈，步跌一二千元。黃豆賡續下挫二三千元。赤豆再疲二三千元，苞米步削一二千元，紅糧續低二三千元。</p>
<p>芝蔴去路呆滯，猛落萬元，尙少受主。生仁銷化冷淡，在跌二萬元。油市一蹶不振，繼續　跌。豆油暴跌二萬元，生油因青島回小，在瀉二三萬元。蔴油淸油菜油均見猛挫二三萬元。</p>
<h3>要求拆遷日水泥工廠　請求結果極圓滿　待作成方案向賠委會提出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國水泥工業同業公會，爲呈請政府交涉拆遷日本水泥工廠，移充賠償，俾利復興事，曾於上週五派遺代表携呈晋京，分向行政院，政院賠償委員會，經濟部，外交部，資委會等請願。</p>
<p>據參加請願之該會副總幹事奚正修昨語記者：此行結果，極爲圓滿。本會請願，根據二點：（一）日本水泥工業，在戰前已有卅八家，每年產量達四千萬桶，本身耗用，不過半數，其餘主要係銷我國及南洋羣島。（二）如國內秩序恢復，則建設時期，尤需大量水泥，此項水泥，斷非目前國內之生產量，所能應付。</p>
<p>基於上述理由，向政府請求二點：（一）尅日向遠東賠償委員會交涉，將日本水泥工廠，列入賠償範園。（二）令飭駐日代表　，速向盟師總部，提出聲明，對日本剩餘水泥工業設備，應由我國保留要求拆遷賠償之權利。</p>
<p>請願結果，政院賠償委會，已允在會同經濟部，外交部，資委會各機關共同洽商，作成方案後，再由外交部訓令我駐美大使顧維鈞，向遠東賠償委員會，正式提出交涉云。</p>
<h3>五月份工廠用煤　分配辦法通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民用煤量分配委員會第二次會議，於昨日下午二時卅分，在燃管會舉行。到工商輔導處，警備司令部，公用局，社會局，工業協會，市商會，煤業，機製煤球業，及內河輪船業等公會代表多人。由燃管會副主委張善揚主席，討論迄六時許散會。當通過對五月份工廠用煤一萬五千噸之分配辦法，案件共十餘起。聞本月份以格於時間關係，仍按燃管會原定分配辦法分配。至改進之分配辦法，將於本週五六另行召開小組會，以便商討草案，一經通過，即可於下月份施行云。</p>
<h3>五千元偽鈔　央行說明辨眞法</h3>
<p>近日偽鈔充斥市上，且種類時有增加，頃息中央銀行三十六年發行之草綠色版二千元券，發現有塗改爲同樣花紋及顏色之五千元者甚多。此種假鈔之鑑別，甚爲明顯：（一）眞鈔紙質較佳，（二）正三中間略呈紅色，（三）僞鈔「伍」字毛而不光，（四）眞鈔是三十四年印，僞鈔爲三十六年印，（五）眞鈔下端有「中央印製廠」字樣，假鈔爲「中央印製廠上海廠」，（六）眞鈔反面之局長及副局長簽名爲「李駿邦」及「因福　」，假鈔爲「梁平」與「陳廷祚」，（七）眞鈔反面之2000爲圓體字，假鈔爲方體字云。</p>
<h3>支配蠶絲原料　猶待最後決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉國內絲廠車數，多於原料一倍，支配甚爲困難。蠶　產銷協導委會　經二次開會擬　，仍未能作最後決定。聞現正將修正辦法，諮詢第三區繅絲公會意見。據悉：三區繅絲公會業於昨日下午四時，召開理監事會表，褚輔成冷禦秋等均出席，一俟得有確實意見，將由蠶絲協導會提出，作最後之決定。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕蠶絲產銷協導委會第三次會議，已定於今日上午十時，在老靶子路二一六號中蠶公司舉行。主要議題，爲審查貸款收繭絲廠資格，及核准收兩數量云　上海市捲烟廠工業同業公會，以政府本期菸葉外匯仍爲八百萬美元，區區之數，實不敷本市各菸廠需用。除呈請當局予以寬放外，並於昨召開理監事會議，討論此項八百萬美元之菸葉，將如何分配於九十三家之菸廠會員。經全體議決，組織一小組委員會，統籌處理。當即選出姚書紳張雨文等九人爲小組委員，並擬呈請當局，准由公會代理各生產菸廠直接取得外匯，在未得核准前，各進口行所申請購入之菸葉原料，須全部出售於正式出產菸廠，不得流入業外人之手，免遭囤積居奇而影響捲烟之正當生產。</p>
<h3>絲市平靜　綢貨疲軟</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市極堅穩，一二〇號高山有光開盤喊五百七八十萬元，因在有求無供狀態下，喊價遂漸見上升，直至六百三十萬元成交一箱，收盤價爲六百二十萬元，下午毫無交易，卒喊一千六百萬元，比上日高二十萬元。</p>
<p>絲經市况仍靜，銀根雖緊，喊價不易下落，尤其是A字等級，市上頗缺，計算成本，在二千萬關外，故昨市喊價仍需二千萬元，並無成交。C字等級，做價與上日相仿，不過貨款均係五日至七日期票，干經另担次貨只喊一千三百萬元，尙乏受主。</p>
<p>綢貨一致疲軟，被面喊價跌四五十萬元，大誠格子璧縐做價二萬六千五百元至二萬七千元，比上日短去二千六百元，原因爲銀根頗緊，各方均願斬割求脫，有以致之，杭貨羅紡等杭市報小，且申市交易甚缺，故昨價每兩跌落一千元。</p>
<h3>原料同業有吸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕原料市况，因廠家銀根軋緊，熟門貨，已呈呆滯。冷門貨以進價甚高，故同業反有吸收。據業中人云，原料來價，日益上漲，即使能暢通進口，與現時滬價亦低下一倍有餘。如凡士林等，均爲夏令熱銷貨品，現來價每磅自九分五厘至一角美金，加上運費拆息一倍，成本已達五千有餘，故國外定貨，不若吸收現貨爲合算。</p>
<h3>蔴袋趨升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔴袋以本市向外埠收貨者日多，更以繭汎期近，用途增加，實銷轉繁。印度二磅半綠綫袋每只上升至三萬三千元，三綫一號一萬四千元，白綫一號一萬四千元。</p>
<h3>紗布運銷轉口　要求變通辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡業公會昨舉行四千錠以上紗廠全體會員大會，討論經過，通過重要議案二起：（一）通過分認一千萬元美金價券案。（二）自政院頒行抑平紗布價格三項辦法後，本市與內地紗布之運銷轉口，全盤陷於停頓。議決請公會函陳紡管會，於十日內，另擬變通辦法，以體商艱云。</p>
<p>經部批示　原則通過</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據紡管會息：紗布轉口辦法之大原則，業已接奉經濟部批示，修正通過。茲尙須根據該項大原則，擬具實施細則，日內即可公布施行云。</p>
<h3>進出口同業公會　決議要案四起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口商業同業公會，日前召開理監事聯席會議，決議案四起：</p>
<p>（一）國行關於委託銷售外匯，均限於本月廿四日前結售，皮毛業公會同業，因國外市塲呆滯，未能脫售者尙多，擬向國行要求展期。決議：與該會聯合向國行及各主管機關申請，要求撤銷限期。必要時推派代表向各有關機關請願。</p>
<p>（二）聯鎖制聞尙須經輸出輸入主管當局交換意見，甚望當局予以採納，俾目前該業處境，得予迅速展開。</p>
<p>（三）舉行預備會，俾產生會員大會代表。預備會分六次召開，本月底下月初產生。代表會員大會日期，俟下次理監事會議決定。代表大致有三百四十餘人。</p>
<p>（四）編印會員錄，於本月底前完成。</p>
<h3>工商天地第三期出版</h3>
<p>潘士浩發行袁拜里主編之一工商天地」第三期，昨已出版。內容除有專家執筆之：『萬元大票』及『食米前途』兩大專輯外，並有內幕新聞多篇。每册定價二千元。</p>
<h3>第二季限額分配申請案　達一萬五千件以上</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪輸管會限額分配處，提詢問題多則，承該處某負責人分爲解答，茲誌其大要如次：（一）第一季之限額分配事宜，刻已辦竟達百分之九十，現正進行辦理二季限額分配事宜。迄目前爲止，申請案件共達一萬五千件以上。申請金額，共達美金六億三千萬元。（二）過去對進口商資格之審核，及進口限額之分配，大致係參照一九四六年之統計資料。茲以此項辦法，於上海進口商，較爲有利，故已着全國各區，提出其他參考資料，（例如戰前之轍入數量等，）再參照調整，以示公允。（三）進口貨須經由進口商經營之原因：（甲）進口商對內地廠商所需要之各種輸入品，亦能調劑供應。（乙）核准登記之進口商，以格於辦法規定，當有資格經營進口業。（四）進口商資格申請登記，現雖截止，惟下列兩種進口商，仍可申請登記候核：（甲）戰前設立且有業務之進口商，（乙）國外某著名廠商出品之特約經理商。（五）爲避免進口商所訂進口原料不合一般廠商需要起見，該處已將各種輸入品之限額，及各核准進口商所分配到之限額，列具詳表，送陳工業協會，以便參考，而統籌洽商。該處於發給許可證之前，尙須各進口商提供其輸入品出售予各廠商之合約，以資證明。故想信輸入品不切實需之困難，當不難解決云。</p>

<h3>合肥全貌</h3>
<p>— 二日快要訊　本報合肥記者白萍</p>
<p>今日的合肥雖是安徽全省政治中心，而且省會遷回安慶尙無確期，而這兒破爛古舊，比之前年勝利初臨時，實在進步非常有限，建設合肥，生活在這兒的人們正在作如此的期待　然而，目前是談不上建設的，省會，在原則上，仍要遷返安慶，要說建設現在的省會合肥，省政府方面是有所顧慮的。讓記者把合肥晝下一個輪廓，祝福它此後有快連的進步。</p>
<p>文化圈內　極目荒凉</p>
<p>先向文化園地兜一個　子。合肥現有日報四家，週報一家，皖報安徽日報是對開，日出一張合肥日報公正報是四開一張，逍遙津週報每期四開一張。這五家報紙，都非純粹民營，但同樣的患着營養不良症。人少錢少，只靠「現役」工作人員苦幹硬幹。通訊社有健行·超然·民本·華中·四家，每天發稿。自從經濟緊急措施實施以來，由於物價之高壓，其苦撑的程度也愈加深。　大小書店有十多家，營業淸淡，門可羅雀。這些書店都是代售上海出版的書刋。在合肥，物價高，賺錢難，愛看書報的人多是窮措大，有錢的人又沒有這種時間與興趣，站在書店裏揩油的倒還大有人在，眞正掏荷包購買的就少而又少了。另有幾家專營出租書籍買賣，生意比書店似乎略勝一籌，可惜出租的多是「三國演義」，「水滸傳」，一類的畫，新鮮的刋物依然絕無踪跡，這在書報愛好者眞是一大缺憾。</p>
<p>說到出版界，那更可憐了。安徽政治，安徽文獻，安徽衛生，新學風，這都是政府。機關發行的，各就主管業務作理論的分析與業務的宣傳，而這些刋物幾乎每期都是難產的，印刷條件限制了它，經費問題也是最大因素。在此情形下，要想找一本爲文化而文化的刋物，那是「踏破芒鞋無覓處」了。</p>
<p>音樂戲劇，這里也有組織的，但沒有職業性的工作者，而是公務員業餘的東西，因爲時間與徑濟的限制，就從無一次公開演出，比如說吧，一個月前報紙上就載有上演「日出」的新聞，到今天却寂然無聞，連影子也不見了。</p>
<p>建設事業　有心無力</p>
<p>據說，勝利後省府遷來合肥時，對於合肥街道訂有改善計劃，聽說那個計劃是相當龐大的，如果實行，許多房屋要拆讓，街道廣闊平坦，會使合肥作跳躍十年以上的進步。然而時隔一年多，除掉有幾條街就原形將亂石改爲石子舖土的馬路外，其餘仍是畸嶇不平，走起路來，蹩蹩扭扭的。這自然不是建設當局不肯努力，他們體察民情的結果，實行起來，就有太多的困難，建設廳長劉貽燕，曾對記者說過：「政府本身沒有錢，合肥市塲絕少富商巨賈，重建街道會呌不少人破產，如果商人自動拆屋，改良街道，我當絕對歡迎，但是我不能下令硬幹。勝利後民困已深，只好暫時將就，何况省會還不是永遠在此呢？」這正是建設合肥的大障礙！</p>
<p>平時需要錢，戰時需要錢，勝利了也需要錢。自從勝利後，建國開始，首先就要建設費，偏偏今天欠缺的就是錢。現在合肥有兩大問題亟待解決：一是飲水問題，一是光的問題。但因爲錢的問題，同樣不能解決。合肥城是東西長，南北短，當年建城的人把東門外的河道（通巢湖）引長到城西，也許就是爲了城內飲料問題，日月逝於上，這條河年久失修，今天東門城牆下的大涵洞已全爲泥土淤塞，城內的河身也幾平於陸地，於是城內的居民不得不飲用井裏鹹水了。初到合肥的人，無不苦於喝鹹水茶，鹹水的確不宜爲飲料，在夏天倒下一杯茶，不一刻便變成黑色了，而且私家的井很多，與陰溝毘連，幾乎汚水與井水成了循環作用，實在有礙衛生。再就是光的問題，合肥迄今沒有電燈，（戰前原有電燈廠，被日本人破壞了），居民用煤油燈，還有用植物油燈，在使用方面極爲不便，對人的目力也有損害，各機關尤感到不方便。去年就聽說要疏濬城內的河，設置電燈廠，可是，到現在，「只聽樓梯響」，還是「未見人下來」。</p>
<p>最近省府決議設置合肥市政籌備處，由建設應兼辦，希望它不會僅是一個機構名詞。</p>
<p>地下錢莊　昂頭闊步</p>
<p>合肥是安徽的中心地，全縣土地面積有六〇三五方公里，耕地面積有三·一五七·七三一畝，人口有一·二七四·三八四人。這三個數字，是居於全省各縣之冠的，但合肥的經濟價値，不及蕪湖與蚌埠，因此也就不及這兩地繁榮。現在合肥城內，據省會警局統計，僅有五萬四千人，地方人口少，又非交通要道，商業就窒息在苦悶之境。</p>
<p>在全國經濟不景氣的今天，合肥商業上自然顯得蕭條冷落，但有一點與京滬蕪蚌各地不同的，就是較大的商號，十之七八是集股成立，賺得利潤當然無話可說，縱是蝕本不能維持時，資本雄厚的股東可以增股，或者原股東退出，另增股東，店面依然存在的。再者，內地商業買賣，總以進貨價格為脫手的原則，貴買貴賣，蝕本總是千載難逢的事。還有，譬如上海某項貨價漲，這裏自然跟着漲，有時上海價跌了，這裏並不馬上跟着跌，必須經過一個時日纔會下跌，如此，這裏商店極少幾乎絕無倒閉的事，當京滬各地倒風最盛的時候，這裏依然平靜，所以終年沒有什麽大减價大拍賣，或者樂隊吹打以廣招徠的事，老是那樣平平淡淡，維持古城的市面。</p>
<p>是一個商人說的，合肥商人願向地下錢莊貸款，而不願向銀行貸款，因爲商人的錢全視週轉運用，借貸時他要划算利息的，向銀行貸款利息一分二，非要抵押品不可，還款期也確定一月或幾個月，而且請貸覓保，手續麻煩，地下錢莊則不然，放款者總是知道貸款者的底細，並有友誼，不一定要抵押品，借得一筆錢，雖是利息較銀行高，（利息一分五）但他今天借了，明天門市下來錢，就可償還一部份，又無辦公時間限制，比之向銀行預先付息來得便利，而週轉的效果則是一樣，所以，地下錢莊比銀行生意倒反來得活躍。　記者接觸過許多公務員，從談話中，知道都對現職難安，結果，他們認爲滔滔皆然，改行也還是道麼一回事，只好一天天混下去。有位公務員說：「本行不是內行，改行更是外行，做一行怨一行，丟這行還要戀這行」。生活壓人，公務員們就在這矛盾的情緒中挨度着上班下班的機械生</p>
<p>我們希望政府注意公務員的生活，老是讓他們唉聲嘆氣挨度日子，這對於行政效率是有損無益的。</p>
<h3>台省一葉</h3>
<p>— 嘉義四日航訊　帝冬</p>
<p>客家民族　生活安逸</p>
<p>這裏的老百姓，除了極少數的土人——高山族之外，大部的同胞都是來自閩粵二省，全省人口號稱六百五十萬，高山族人約三十萬到四十萬，客家人百餘萬，其餘都是福建的閩南人，高山族人一直到現在仍居深山鮮與平原人往來過從，他們的生活也還是過的半原始的生活，說的是土語和日語，性情兇悍，客族人聽說亦因來台較遲的緣故，聚居的地方也比較是山僻的鄕間，但是他們富於刻苦和耐勞的習性，能憑其天賦性能與大自然鬥爭，所謂「人傑地靈」，在他們不屈不撓英勇努力之下，同樣也有他的偉大成就。許多的荒山開闢了，許多的野原變成了稻田，他們造成了叧一種局面，和生活的根據地。看吧！那個村子的客家民族，不是都過着愉快安逸的農村生活呢！閩省來的一般同胞，大半都是居住在城市，平日靠手工而生活，光復後，因爲各種大小工廠，在戰時摧毁慘重，而政府又限於人力物力及原料的缺乏，一時無法復工，在過去一個短時期內，他們普遍感到失業的痛苦。</p>
<p>一年皆春　氣候宜人</p>
<p>台灣的氣候，大致和閩粵兩省相彷，嘉義以南氣候較熱，但因四面環海，氣溫變化甚爲劇烈，一日之間，凉熟迭更，不過可以說台灣是一年皆春，除了六七月十二月有極短的時間似乎有多少冬夏之分，大半的日子都是溫暖宜人，就是冬夏兩季，也無需輕裘禦寒，或者會酷熱得令人難受，並由於一年皆春的關係水菓的出產生，四季都有，筆者以爲特足以報導的，就是西瓜，在這裏不單爲夏季解暑的上品，冬天同樣也能享受，他如香蕉橘子那不用說終年都有。</p>

<p>新英格蘭六州在美國四十八州之中資格最老，文化上也居於領導地位。每一年，所有的中等學校舉行話劇年賽，對於促進話劇的研究，與居民趣味的提高頗有貢獻。</p>
<p>今年綠山州各校舉行預賽之期，恰好和綠山大學的春假同時。</p>
<p>倘若沒有劇運前輩兼唐人街之友　禮（Mr.Carl　Glick）從中慫恿，並熱誠帮助，我便不能李受道一個好機會。葛禮先生雖不是綠山州的土著，却與綠山州有不解　。他在三四十年以前，便到處推行民間戲劇運動（Community　Theater　Movewent），東西南北各州都有他的蹤跡。然而綠山州，他認爲最美，綠山州的「級任敎員聯合會」也深知葛禮先生最愛他們的桑梓，所以每一年都請葛禮先生來擔任話劇預賽的栽判。多少和我之留在綠山有關（慚愧！），所以我在道義上也不得不陪他巡迴全州一番。</p>
<p>我們兩人在一起旅行，走遍全州。</p>
<p>我們北至St.Albans，南至Arlington，東至St.Johnsbury。而至</p>
<p>Middlebury。我們沿湖而行，又穿山而行。</p>
<p>到每一個地方，必有一位中學校長以新英格蘭的規矩作君子式的招待。我們兩人就盛辭暫別，回到旅館去飽餐當地土　，然後午睡，喝酒，晚餐很神氣地緩步走進該中學的禮堂。</p>
<p>在每一處的禮堂中，平均有三四齣以至五齣的獨蒂劇可看。演員都是中學生，天眞爛漫，十分高興於有機會表現自己。聽衆也百分之九十是中學生，很欣賞他們同學在舞臺上的成就。無論演員做錯了或做對了一個姿態，台下的同學無不鼓掌。說錯了或說對了一句話，也是鼓掌。尤其是遇到接吻的塲合，鼓掌之外，還夾着野猪式的咆哮。Even在美國，中學生對於接吻也尙有希奇可貴之感。</p>
<p>在三十齣之中，葛禮先生選定六齣去參加新英格籣的決賽。我想介紹這六齣之中，我所更喜歡的三齣：（一）「誰說不能」Who　Says　Can't？（二）「明天再見」Cood　Night，Pleasel！（三）「飢餓的人）The　Hungerers</p>
<p>「誰說不能」是女作家Ratharyn。Mc　Clure著，由St.Albans的Rellows　free　Academy的學生演出。劇情十分簡單，但切合中學生的口味。開慕之時，有一家兄妹二人在母親面前共用早餐，爭奪Cake。母親似乎偏袒男孩子，常常呌女兒到廚房拿東西，走進走出，不呌兒子去做。而且作哥哥的喜歡欺負妹妹，嘲笑妹妹不懂打扮，已經十六歲了，還沒有被男人吻過。——我想，這一點大概是作家言過其實。美國女子到十六歲而尙未被吻的，恐怕並非少數。——妹妹憤怒異常，求敎於女同學。女同學敎了她很多誘人的姿勢。她學得十分笨拙。來了一位男人，是哥哥的同學，對於她的苦心暗示，完全不懂，眞令人焦急，誰知哥哥恰好回家，反以爲蛛絲馬跡不無可疑，嚴厲斥責同學，不應調戲自己的妹妹，不應在未得他的同意以前，吻他的妹妹。同學被他激怒了，就當眞地吻起來，「誰說不能」——妹妹勝利了。哥哥無可奈何。</p>
<p>「明天再見」是James　Daggett所著，由WaterburyHigh　School演出。幕啓，有一位半老的男人躺在床上，鼾聲如雷。他的女兒，妻子，內兄，紛紛探視，設法把他呌醒。他驅走他們，繼續鼾睡。這是一個下午，並非晚上。他已經睡了三天，並且無病。他是銀行的經理，有許多要公待他處理，像這樣鼾睡下去，不知要影響多少存戶的信心。所以女兒，妻子，內兄，要用一切的方法阻止他再睡下去。他大聲抗議，說，「我苦幹了二十年，一刻不停，難道休息一個星期，睡一個痛快，都沒有權利麼？」這一齣劇的精彩之處在演員的「做工」（Pantomime）。</p>
<p>「飢餓的人」是「人間喜劇」的作家William　Saroyan所著，由Rutland　High　School演出。牠描寫一作家，襯衫破爛，埋首在打字機上工作。他幻想到　中的主人翁，一一來訪，向他麻煩。第一個進來的，是一位Young　Capitalistl星六晚郵」的推銷員，請他訂一份「星六晚郵」。作家說，「我沒有錢」。推銷員說，「世界上何以沒有一個人肯訂「星六晚郵」？作家說，「你籤慶」？推銷員說，「我恐怕是有一點餓。前天早上，我記得似乎吃過一次早飯」。跟着，又進來一位女子，推銷員和她　談，作家請他們兩人出去，但這位少女，也是一個飢餓的人，不肯出去。作家問她，是否眞需要麵包，還是需要愛情。她說：「不知道」。作家說：「你顯然更需要愛情」。女十很直截地問他：「你愛我麽？」他說，「不能。」少女大哭，他連忙說，「我可以愛你，我…眞愛你」。少女說：「我不能相信」。但是她當然感覺好了許多。作家說：「倘若我身上還能有五分錢，便可以把稿子拿到出版家那裏去賣了」。——他同情這位推銷員與這位飢餓的少女，毅然決然講推銷員把打字機拿出去賣五塊錢，四塊錢……一塊錢，不可以少過一塊錢，希望大家吃個痛快。推銷員拿走打字機後，他便吿訴少女，一件童年時的經歷。</p>
<p>他說：「在我很小的時候，我喜歡葡萄，但是沒有吃過。有一天，我看見一家人家的架子上，葡萄長得很好看。我看了很久，想到牠們的滋味。但是主人出來了，以爲我偸葡萄，要捉我，我在奔而去。……」少女問：「後來呢？」作家說：「故事完了」。少女說，「好慘啊！」便放聲大哭。</p>
<p>推銷員回來了，打字機不曾賣出。他們三人，加上一個以後走進來的老婦人，一齊餓死。在餓死之前，說出很多富於哲理的話。……然而原來是一塲春夢，幻想。</p>
<p>Rutland　High　School的學生精神飽滿，能够演出這一齣戲頗不容易。我想，他們頗有在決賽時獲獎的希望。</p>
<p>在其餘二十幾齣失敗的學生劇團之中，很多是失敗於太喜歡演老太婆。女學生富於模仿，無論中美都有喜扮老太婆的趨勢。老實說，我不懂她們的動機。</p>
<p>劇本的選擇與導演的技藝，當然都是勝敗的因素。有些學校之失敗，不在學生，而在導演。我向葛禮先生建議，令各校排演同一劇本，則去取之間，較爲公平。他說：「也有毛病。因爲裁判員看到第三個學校以後，便看膩了，分數便越來越苛」。</p>
<h3>祈禱</h3>
<p>— 捷克Karel　Capek作高朗譯</p>
<p>哦，主　，美麗土地的創造者，你看看我們的苦痛和失望；向你，我們不用描述我們所遭受的不幸或是怎樣垂下了的頭　。我們並不是爲羞恥而低頭，也沒有羞恥的理由，雖然命運像鐵　般地打擊着我們。然而我們並沒有被壓潰；也沒有顯示我們的勇氣，我們的國家不會失去他的光榮；只不過失去了他全身的一部份。我們像被擒縛在輪齒上的人，最先嘗到最慘酷的苦痛，而他還是活着。我們的國家生存在極度的苦難中，可是他覺到生命還是那麽强有力地活着。</p>
<p>哦，主啊，我們國家的創造者，向你，我們不用細說我們的災禍。然而爲了我們唯一的要求，我們奮鬥到底，我們的嘴巴和心臟也決不讓它失去，那就是忠信。忠信在我們的心裏，在我們的歷史裏。在我們歷史裏的忠信我們決不叛逆。爲忠化而奮鬥的我們，更有美好有望的將來和生長，更有開花而應美的的果實；那暫時的强暴又算得了甚麽。</p>
<p>比强暴更偉大的是眞理，因爲眞理是永續的，就是在磨難的時間，我們必得嚴　地發誓決不偸懶。現在我們要比從前更努力地爲國家而工作，爲了它內在的力量與統一。優秀的人民才能拯救國家，我們將爲歷史的正面而工作。在我們的命運裏，一齣世界性的戲劇，將以偉大和光榮的努力在進行地演出了。</p>
<p>我們一點不怕世界事變的趨勢，相反地，每一個野蠻的勢力的結合，怎麼也比不上民族，國家，人民所需求的自由，和平與平等。我們必須耐煩地工作；我們必須比過去更愛我們的國家；彼此之間都具有偉大的愛。我們相信最主要的就是在地球上負起使命；被歐洲歷史所指示黑暗時期的現今，我們儘可能把我們的國家在不久的將來建造起有望的前途。</p>
<p>哦，主啊，我們並不是爲復仇而祈禱。然而我們願你以忠信的精神和希望來鼓勵我們；願你不議我們那一個敗退和失望。祗是讓我們每個人探求怎樣爲我們國家將來的永恒的命運而服役，我們不需要任何人失望。我們需要忠信。我們需要內在的力量，我們需要增加我們十倍力量有效的愛。</p>
<p>決不能喚一偶國家爲弱小，因爲他偉大的忠信足够建造遠大的將來。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血508</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>她先是嘻嘻一笑，緊接把一顆頭像博浪　似的，那麽狠狠地一搖，搖的那兩隻小髮辮，跟着一前一後跳蕩，左右換了一個地方；撐在前面的一隻，調到後面，拖在後面的那一隻，跳到前面來，然後才好像沒事一大堆似的，輕描淡寫地說：</p>
<p>「那沒沒有關係」。</p>
<p>這是什麽話？人家請敎尊姓大名，是個見面禮節；往下談話，也好稱呼。人以禮來，我以禮往，才呌作「禮尙往來」，也是人情世故，必需的一個正當問答，怎麽可以說「沒有關係」這「沒有關係」四個字，到底是個什麽涵義？還是說她到這裏來，並非找鶴見談話，她這姓名，說與不說，都是一樣，並「沒有關係」呢？還是說她　姓名，不必說出來，不管人家請敎不請敎，都「沒有關係」？</p>
<p>鶴見一聽對方說出這們蹊巧古怪的幾個字，一時也捉摸不定，不知她究竟打的什麽悶葫蘆；只能猜想這個少女，有些不懂世故罷了。但一瞧她那變眉目如此靈活，必是很聰明玲瓏，雖說年紀輕些，也不至如此不懂世故哪。那麽，旣經請敎她的姓名，令兄是誰，怎麽會有這等「特別」簽覆？</p>
<p>「哦……」！鶴見只能怔上加怔了。</p>
<p>「不」，她看見鶴見呆眉瞪眼，怔在那裏，大約知道他有些窘了，對自己「沒有關係」這句話，須得加上一句解釋：「我本來是要找我哥哥談兩句話，這話與您先生也有關係，如今我哥哥旣不在這裏，不談也沒有關係」。說畢，又是嘻嘻一笑，這，呌鶴見拿什麽話來應付？鶴見要是說——「小姐的要同令兄所談的話，旣是與鄙人右關係，不妨直接向鄙人賜敎」，——可是誰又知道她所說的「關係」，是怎樣的一種關係？是要呌她哥哥不必參顱鶴見這段糾紛呢？還是她自己要明瞭鶴見本身的事呢？這個「蘭係一的範圍，　大得無邊無際，是否應該請她直接賜敎，還在兩可之間咧。就算鶴見不管這些婆婆媽媽，眞的請她直接賜敎，怕還要防着她又是那麼輕描淡寫的一句：「沒有關係」！那時恐怕鶴見更要下不得合里。</p>
<p>然而如要說「令兄究竟是誰，鄙人還沒有知道，他來與不來，更不敢說一定…」換句話，旣是你以爲不談也沒有關係，您就請走路罷」，這一句話，却也不能出口：第一，也許她的令兄，眞的是守一，李明，或那韓方同志，這三個人中之一；這等不客氣，豈不要招他們見怪？第二，看那女子雖然說了，「不談也沒有關係」這句話之後，却紋風不動，站在當前，一絲也沒有撤退的意思。鶴見確實產　了。</p>
<h3>燈</h3>
<p>— 斯民</p>
<p>一盞燈，就是一個美麗的靈魂哪！</p>
<p>當太陽拖着滯重的脚步，踱下山坡時；當夜在四野裏築起了黑色的圍　時，燈，就像斃花一般地開遍整個利子或者整個城市了。如果你要說燈是大地如星星吧！那末，你的想像是更美麗了</p>
<p>看見燈，我們就想到光明和明天。</p>
<p>燈，是智慧的眼睛。由於她的指示，你會從迷惘的生活圈子裏跳出來，辨認出你自己的路向。而且你也不會跌交了。</p>
<p>在燈的啓示裏，人們從不同的方向去獵取他們的希望和幸福啊！</p>
<p>別輕　她，也別嫌她太小，憑你怎樣汚黑的角落她都照得到，她所到的地方，有生命會倔强起來，有卑鄙齷齪也都被完全揭發了。</p>
<p>吿訴我，一隻飄泊的船，迷失在夜籠罩下的陌生的海裏，看到了燈，那該是怎樣地狂喜呢？</p>
<p>假使有這末一盞燈，我想了這樣想。她是無比地大，我舉着她，在這難得天亮的長夜裏，我瘋狂地到處奔跑；以激動的聲音召喚着罹難的人民……。</p>

<p>——第二次交響樂演奏會聽後感</p>
<p>市府交響樂團於本月十一日下午五時一刻在　心舉行第二次演奏會，點綴了這美麗的五月——音樂的季節，給愛好音樂的人們，帶來了不少崇高的精神快慰。</p>
<p>筆者曾往聆聽，茲將所感簡略而拉雜地述之如下：</p>
<p>（一）這次節目的排定，雖然祗有五個大節目，但代表着德。英。奧。法及蘇聯五國作曲家底作品，而各有特色，市府交響樂團做到了　名符其實地　介紹世界名樂。</p>
<p>（一）在一般的演奏成績上講，這次演奏不但比較上次顯有進步，而且相當成功。指揮富華敎授在上次演奏時因爲很久沒有指揮了，顯得有點「怯塲」，這次指揮，己經勝任愉快了。尤以指揮海登底D長調第四交響樂（即非常有名的「時鐘交響樂」一曲時，有力而富於表情，這首交響樂頗近乎「標題音樂」（Programme　Music）的意味充份地發揮出來了。</p>
<p>（三）在演奏聖桑底「大提琴協奏曲」的一個節目，大提琴獨奏者夏佛磋夫（Shevtzoff）底純鍊的技巧與樂曲的理解力，把這位現代法國浪漫派大作曲家的風格與幻想加以昇華了，烘托得淋漓盡　。筆者聽過夏佛磋夫底大提琴獨奏有好幾次了，但這次演奏却有意外圓滿的成績。</p>
<p>（四）八首蘇聯民謠，實際上說起來，票敎意味是超乎民歌風味的，在業曲本身上講，遠不如「梵加」（Vanka）「伏爾加船夫曲」等蘇聯民謠那樣地富於民歌氣息的。這八首民謠的特色，在曲調與節奏方面，尙能保持着蘇聯音樂的一貫作風。（最顯著的是普遍地應用短調（Minor）的曲子很多。）</p>
<p>由於兩次演奏的情形，筆者願向市府交響樂團竟獻兩點意見：</p>
<p>（一）關心的塲子太少，祇能容納五百餘人，所以向隅和退出的聽衆甚多，爲便於市民普遍有欣賞好音樂的機會計，該團似應立即另覓演奏塲所，好在目前已屆初夏，天氣也暖和起來了，似可提平恢復過去在逸園的露天演奏。</p>
<p>（二）爲倡導中國音樂計，每次演奏，最好安排一些中國音樂作品的節目，如黃自。趙元任。馬思聰等幾個出色的中國作曲家，他們有不少的管絃樂作品，或者器樂方面的新創作，似應儘量設法介紹給音樂聽衆欣賞，藉以喚起一般人士對於中國音樂作品有所認識，並求中國音樂的進步。</p>
<p>南京大屠殺案主犯日酋谷壽夫被槍決前，在法庭上遺書致其妻子，中有云：「昭和××年×月×日，余在南京雨花台執行死刑，從此永別，身葬異域，魂返　傍」。假若不知道寫這封信的人是什麽人，犯的是什麽罪，看了這幾句凄惋悱惻的話，恐怕誰都會付與同情和憐憫吧。</p>
<p>抗戰時，從陣亡日軍的屍體上，往往搜得許多未發的家信和日記，裏面對於故鄉與父母妻子的思念、情感　麗，　綿動人，如果不是證據確實，誰又能相信感情這樣豐富的人就是奸淫　殺無惡不作的人。</p>
<p>於是使我們想起一個問題；充滿了獸慾與獸性的人，怎麽也會有正常的人性存在呢？</p>
<p>我的解釋是：日本的軍國主義訓練成日本民族成爲信服　權的子孫；他們沒有理智，沒有感情，有的只是暴力，只是鮮血；但是當他們比餃淸醒的時候，他們不免流露出人類眞性的感情；於是他們反戰，厭戰，怕死，懷鄕，戀情，處處都表現了他們雙軍人格的矛盾。</p>
<h3>過去與未來</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>甲男：我云看過一位手相專家，他投我要生一塲大病。</p>
<p>乙男：可是你六個月以前不是生過一塲大病了嗎？</p>
<p>甲男：找也對他說這個話。可是他說，「你六個月不洗手了，這叫我有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<h3>「白領工人」</h3>
<p>— 阿林</p>
<p>說起來也許會令美國也有臭虫論者高興，眞如我們之有物價工資問題，美國也有物價和工資的問題。祗是美國的物價在戰時戰後僅漲上百分之五十三，而我們的物價　少漲一至二萬倍而已。所以，在美國工人與雇主的工資糾紛不斷發生着，政府承認這是工人的　科。可是據說「白領工人」就沒有這樣的好福氣，由於沒有組織，不能築體行動也。</p>
<p>這一事例倒頗能引起太平洋彼岸的我們的同感的，爲了是先生們中，爲了這麼一點子身份，祗能屈居寫字間，不敢對雇主哼一聲，因爲苦果你「輕舉妄動」，少不得解聘停職另請高就也。欠薪時，工人可以抗議，薪工遠不及物價時，工人可以要求增加，然而眞唯你白領階級，祗能喊喊喳喳，聽候雇主吩咐了。</p>
<p>今天就有許多寫字間先生比他們茶房的工錢還要低上一半，這眞是對智識份子一個極大的諷刺。本來「白領工人」也不能有什麽職業工會，即使見得面來，也祗能互到今天天氣哈哈哈，顧左右而言他也。</p>
<p>「白領工人」之苦，竟會中外一樣，這也是二十世紀的奇蹟吧。</p>
<p>影譚</p>
<h3>「砲火鴛鴦」</h3>
<p>— 箴</p>
<p>「砲火鴛鴦」是部戰時在英倫攝製的片子，故事極簡單的描寫一對生活平庸刻板的靑年夫婦，丈夫是個某大公司的記帳負，後因被徵召入伍，參加皇家海軍，繼之妻子亦投身婦女海軍服務隊，軍伍的生活使二個人踏上了另一種新的生活，他們變得年輕，活潑，英勇，三年後，二個人在一次假期中重又會面；會面前他倆都有着離婚的意念，當彼此見面後，却相互　奇於對方的意料之外的改變，離婚之意便成過去，重歸和好。</p>
<p>顯然這樣一個故事是爲了鼓勵作戰軍人而變成的。它是以喜劇的筆調，描繪英國人的刻板生活，另一方面，强調了那些保衛祖國的軍人生活是怎樣的活潑英勇，他們在反法西斯戰爭中走上了新生，這種新的生活，不僅保衛了民主與祖國，也鞏固了家庭的幸福與愛情的安全。這顯明的對比，有力而正確。因爲只有消滅了殘暴的法西斯强盜，才能保證民主世界裏的自由與幸福，作者是聰明而妥切的，安排了這些有着高度風趣的小故事，雖然有些地方難免誇張了些，把戰爭中男女的愛情變幻寫得那末輕率，但是作爲一個喜劇題材來處理，這些都是無傷於主題的。</p>
<p>劇中由勞勃杜奈與黛博拉蔻兒分飾的這一對夫婦勞勃與凱茜，尤爲難得的收獲，勞勃杜奈飾演的丈夫，在未參加海軍前的人物性格刻劃與外型的塑造，較之後面的戲尤爲生活，假期中返來與妻子在街頭爭執以及在酒店內卵戲，也是有着相當成就的。而飾演妻子的黛博拉蔻兒，在銀幕上還是顆新星，但是她那洗練深湛的演技，使凱茜這個人物獲得了豐富的生命，樸實無華的演技裏。蘊藏着一種閃爍的光輝。這確是難能可貴的成功。此外葛琳絲瓊斯的黛茜與安吐德的愛娜也均不弱。</p>
<p>除了這些演員給帶來豐富的優秀演技外，我們不能不提出導演兼監製者亞歷山大柯達的成就，他細膩而適度的處理了這個戲，尤其從戲的不斷發展與夫婦二人外型的朔造上的配合，我們看到了導演者的匠心，而氣氛與節奏的把握，人物與塲面的處理，在在都顯示了導演者的優秀才能</p>
<p>這是一部近來少有的好片子，値得向讀者推荐。</p>
<h3>談欺詐</h3>
<p>— 許壽谷</p>
<p>欺詐取財，行使詐欺作不法之行爲，俱屬犯罪，而予所云，乃有法所不禁之詐欺，其將令人不解乎？請畢吾說，吾之所謂不禁之詐欺蓋有三：</p>
<p>（一）審判官問案時，對於犯案者常有哄詞嚇語，使之將罪狀自行供出，以資裁判，此稱詐欺，有時必要，故爲法所不禁。</p>
<p>（二）偵探辦案，手段極其詭秘，令人難測，執法機關乃利用之以捕盜，並不治以欺詐罪，法所不禁，顯然明矣。</p>
<p>（三）行軍之時，攻守進退，最為緊要，若被敵探偵知，即難免失欺，故語有之曰，兵不厭詐，此一詐字，又爲法所不禁者也。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>劉連長也很能證念到他部下的苦衷。</p>
<p>「你讓她上別　……」他希望兩面都顧到。</p>
<p>可是，車上那個胖女人倒忍不住了。</p>
<p>「爲什麽要我下車？我也是買票的！」她氣呼呼地說，臉漲得通紅。</p>
<p>「你有票上後面去！」久坐辦公　，不常外出的熊處長對於這些情形當然不很淸楚。「這裏是司機台、你們女客是不准坐的！」</p>
<p>「放屁！」那個胖女人簡直沒有把他穿的一身金碧輝煌的軍裝放在眼裏。「你們帶來的那個不也是女人嗎？老子不讓！憑你什麼人也不讓！」</p>
<p>能處長勃然大怒。</p>
<p>「司機，你把她拖下來！」</p>
<p>然而司機可不能動手啊！他拿人家錢拿得太多了。</p>
<p>「你先下來！我給你另外想辦法！」痛　相關的劉連長瞧這情形很　尬，便　走上一步，用不很高的聲音，向那臉漲得像一大槐猪肝似的胖女人說，希望把她哄下了車再作道理。</p>
<p>不料這個女人竟也特別的倔強。</p>
<p>「不行，老子不下來！」她操着滿口湖南話，堅決拒絕；眼睛睜得滾圓，像一頭負隅的猛獸一樣的啾定着他們那一堆八　　個被稱做侯局長的中年人倒很鎭定，他心裏顯然早有把握，反側過了身子，背　着雙手，很悠閑地望着別處；倒是他那位年輕的太太沉不住氣，也用眼回瞪着司機台上那個胖女人，滿臉不痛快。</p>
<p>少年得志的態處長認爲這樣太不成話了，把眼一證，惟備當塲給那主管車隊的劉連長一個下不去。（七十）</p>

<h3>Third Meeting of the Executive Yuan Passes: Adjustments to Salaries of Civil and Military Officials, Partial Reorganization of Sichuan and Hebei Provincial Governments</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] At the morning political affairs meeting on the 13th, chaired by Zhang Qun, many important cases were passed. In addition to the adjustment of salaries for public educators and military officers and soldiers, there was also the partial reorganization of Sichuan and Hebei provinces. Liu Siying, of the Youth Party Committee, has been appointed as a member of the Sichuan Provincial Government to participate in local government. (Mr. Liu is currently in Shanghai.) Deng Xihou was officially appointed as Chairman of Sichuan Province. Mr. Deng departed for Sichuan on the 12th. Other important cases passed included draft organizational laws for the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Land Administration, as well as the upgrading of the four cities of Shenyang, Xijing, Hankou, and Guangzhou to municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan. The meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The National Defense Council previously resolved to upgrade the four cities of Shenyang, Xijing, Hankou, and Guangzhou to municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan has also passed a resolution to allocate the number of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators to each city in accordance with the regulations for municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan again passed the resolution to upgrade the four cities to municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, and discussed issues such as the relocation of provincial capitals, financial divisions, and the organization of each city after the upgrade. The following resolutions were made: (1) After the cities are upgraded to municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, the provincial capital does not need to be relocated if there is no suitable location. (2) The provincial and municipal finances shall be discussed and divided by the provincial and municipal authorities, and the actual methods shall be submitted for approval. (3) After the cities are reorganized, the organization should follow the original organization and not be expanded, except for those explicitly defined in the city organization law regarding personnel ranks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 13th Dispatch] Deng Xihou returned to Chengdu from Nanjing on the 12th. He told reporters that this trip to Nanjing was to discuss issues such as the construction and finances of Sichuan Province with the central authorities. The results were very good. Chairman Chiang attached great importance to Sichuan and Kangding (Xikang), and during the audience, he instructed him with "transforming the atmosphere, strengthening public security, and promoting construction." Regarding the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the French bank syndicate has decided to invest, and the contract will be signed soon. The central government has decided to allocate a budget of 39 billion for earthwork engineering, and the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and the Tianquan-Chengdu Railway will also be built.</p>
<h3>Xijing, Shenyang, Hankou, and Guangzhou Upgraded to Municipalities Directly Under the Executive Yuan, Deng Xihou Appointed Chairman of Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The third meeting of the Executive Yuan was held at 9:00 AM on the 13th, chaired by Zhang Qun. In addition to the national defense education report, the following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion: (1) The proposal to adjust the cost-of-living allowances for public educators and military officers and soldiers was passed. (2) The revised draft organizational laws for the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Land Administration were passed. (3) The proposal to upgrade the four cities of Shenyang, Xijing, Hankou, and Guangzhou to municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan was passed.

<h3>New Standards for Salary Adjustments: Base of 340,000 and Multiple of 1,800 for Public Educators in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Other Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The measures for adjusting the cost-of-living allowances for public educators and military officers and soldiers have been passed at the political affairs meeting on the 13th and will be implemented starting this month; they will be implemented immediately after being approved by the Executive Yuan committee. According to a source at the Executive Yuan, the standard for adjusting the salaries of public educators this time is 85%, which was drafted after measuring the affordability of the national treasury and considering the price indices in various regions. At the same time, when salaries were adjusted in December last year, taking Shanghai as an example, the price index was 8,200 times that before the war, and in April this year, it was 15,000 times, an increase of about 80%. Therefore, the adjustment standard was determined to increase by 85%. The following are the main points of the adjustment: (1) The proportion of increase in the base number is larger than the proportion of increase in the multiple. The minimum increase in the base number is one time, and the maximum is more than one time. This will make the income ratio of low-level personnel larger. For example, personnel with a monthly salary of less than 200 yuan will increase by at least 85%, and up to 90%. The proportion of increase for senior personnel is smaller. For example, a specially appointed official with a monthly salary of 800 yuan will only increase by 70%. (2) The regions are re-adjusted with reference to the price situation in the local area in order to adapt to the actual situation. For example, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, and Taiyuan, which were originally listed in Zone 2, are now raised to Zone 1. Jiaxing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Fuzhou, and other places originally listed in Zone 3 are now raised to Zone 2. Liuzhou, which was originally in Zone 4, is now raised to Zone 3.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Salaries for Officers and Soldiers: To Be Approved by the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>The adjustment of the cost-of-living allowances for military officers and soldiers will be funded by additional appropriations from the national treasury and will be approved by the Ministry of National Defense in accordance with past practice. This adjustment will greatly increase the burden on the national treasury. The national treasury's monthly burden for civil servants will increase by a total of 125 billion yuan, and the national treasury's monthly burden for military officers and soldiers will increase by a total of 175 billion yuan. In total, the national treasury's monthly burden will increase by 300 billion yuan. The following are the standards for the cost-of-living allowances for public educators: Zone 1, i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, and Bing, has a base number of 340,000 and a multiple of 1,800. Zone 2, i.e., Su, Xijia, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, and Fuzhou, has a base number of 290,000 and a multiple of 1,600. Zone 3, i.e., Kunming and Liuzhou, has a base number of 240,000 and a multiple of 1,300. Zone 4, i.e., Chongqing, has a base number of 200,000 and a multiple of 1,000. Zone 5, i.e., Guizhou, has a base number of 170,000 and a multiple of 800.</p>
<p>[Note] (1) Police chiefs receive 70% of the base number, and police officers receive 60%, plus the multiple. (2) Public servants receive 60% of the base number. (3) For the nine northeastern provinces, the national currency is calculated according to the standards in this table, and then converted into circulating coupons for payment. (4) Taiwan is not included.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] Director of the Information Bureau Dong Xianguang told reporters today that the Executive Yuan's approval of the increase in salaries for military personnel and public educators has already been included in the revised budget of 200 billion, so there is no need for additional budget.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The third session of the fourth National People's Political Council is scheduled to be held at the National Assembly Hall starting on the 20th, with a session of approximately two weeks. During the meeting, the councilors will conduct extensive discussions on current economic, financial, military, and price issues. In particular, this conference will be the last one of the council, and its significance is even greater, as the task of the People's Political Council will end after the National Assembly, which implements the constitution, is convened on December 25th of this year. The various preparatory matters for the conference have been largely completed, and the meeting notice was sent out as early as April 2, inviting the councilors to attend at that time. The notice for the councilors of the Democratic League was also sent out at the same time. However, due to the inability to contact the Communist Party councilors, the Secretariat of the conference has telegraphed the representatives of the Communist Party in the Executive Headquarters to inform them. The Secretariat has now scheduled registration to begin on the 15th. The total cost of this conference is approximately 1.2 billion yuan. The number of councilors was originally 358, but the Shanxi Provincial Council has added four more members in addition to the original four, so the total number of councilors to attend this conference will be 362. The Secretariat of the conference will host a tea party for all councilors one or two days before the conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai Councilors' Association held a tea party at Jianguo West Road at 3:00 PM yesterday.

Everyone agreed that the People's Political Council should exert its greatest effort to promote peace and stabilize society in the last conference. Although it is not easy to implement this movement based on conscience, it can first require a ceasefire. Secondly, a comprehensive review should be conducted on the cases resolved by previous conferences to understand the government's implementation situation. The proposals for this conference must avoid trivial matters, and focus on the larger issues, concentrate opinions, and then demand implementation after the resolutions are made. It was also decided to hold another tea party on the 17th in order to solicit the opinions of the majority.</p>

<h3>Democratic League Central Standing Committee Decides to Participate in the Current People's Political Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The councilors of the Democratic League have decided to attend the current People's Political Council. This is a decision made by the Democratic League at the standing committee convened at 3:00 PM yesterday. When announcing this news, Ye Duyang, a spokesperson for the Democratic League, said that yesterday's Central Standing Committee was held specifically to discuss this matter. It is reported that the Democratic League councilors are Zhang Lan, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Liang Shuming, and Han Zhao'e.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The opinion of people close to the Democratic League is that there are two reasons why the Democratic League decided to attend the People's Political Council: (1) The People's Political Council is a representative body of public opinion established during the war, which does not violate the principles of the Political Consultative Conference and is not contrary to the purpose of the Democratic League. (2) Qian Duansheng will launch a peace movement in this People's Political Council, so the objective situation is also conducive to the attendance of the Democratic League representatives.</p>
<h3>Now is Not the Appropriate Time to Resume Peace Talks</h3>
<p>Spokesperson of the Social Democratic Party Speaks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A reporter recently visited the spokesperson of the Social Democratic Party about the rumor that some councilors will launch a peace movement, and asked about the party's position. According to the spokesperson, the current price fluctuations and social unrest in this city make people deeply feel that ending the civil war is the fundamental solution. But on the other hand, peace is not a unilateral matter. The Communist Party's intentions at this time cannot be predicted. Even if peace talks are resumed, there is no guarantee of success. Therefore, in terms of the objective situation, now is not the appropriate time to resume peace talks. As far as the Social Democratic Party is concerned, everything is done in accordance with the common implementation outline, but if there is a real possibility of achieving peace, it is willing to contribute even without waiting for the two roads to be opened.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops Withdrawn from Beijing and Tianjin Attacked by Communist Army, Officers and Soldiers Safe, Board Ships to Guam</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] Two trains on the Beijing-Yulin section carrying 500 officers and soldiers of the 5th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps arrived safely in Qinhuangdao yesterday. Hours later, the Communist army swept along the railway and attacked the Tanggu-Tangshan section, damaging several miles of tracks. Fortunately, the U.S. troops were safe and had begun to board three transport ships anchored in the port, preparing to depart for Guam. Another approximately 350 officers and soldiers of the 5th Regiment arrived in Beijing by 75 vehicles via the highway yesterday and were originally scheduled to transfer to trains heading north this morning to join the remaining troops in Qinhuangdao. Now, due to the unexpected development of the situation, they remain at the station and have not departed. The vehicles will be transported by waterway. The Communist army cut off the Beijing-Shenyang Railway at two points at night, and the tracks were damaged for one mile at one point. The 5th Regiment is the first major force of the U.S. military to withdraw from China after the end of the Military Mediation Department.</p>
<h3>Rumor Zhou Enlai in Pyongyang</h3>

<h3>Fu Zuoyi Arrives in Beijing from Bingzhou, Immediately Meets with Li Zongren to Confer on Shanxi Military Affairs, National Army in Yuncheng Launches Attack and Recovers Strongholds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] It is reported that Fu Zuoyi flew to Beijing from Taiyuan at around 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, and immediately went to the Beijing Executive Headquarters to confer with Li Zongren on Shanxi military affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] It is reported that Fu Zuoyi is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 14th to report on the situation in Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] There was an important military meeting in Beijing on the afternoon of the 13th, attended by Li Zongren, Fu Zuoyi, Sun Lianzhong, and senior officials from the Joint Logistics Headquarters to discuss.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 13th Dispatch] Fu Zuoyi left Bingzhou and flew to Beijing at 11:30 AM on the 13th. Before leaving, he had a one-hour long talk with Yan Xishan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 13th Dispatch] Fu Zuoyi received reporters at 8:00 AM on the 13th. According to him: after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this was the first time he had returned to Bingzhou to pay respects to Yan Xishan and visit friends in Taiyuan. Compared with the miserable situation when he left on November 8, 1937 (Fu was responsible for defending Bingzhou at the time), he was filled with emotions. It is a pity that he could not stay for long. The country is a whole. The safety of Taiyuan is not a Shanxi issue. The chairman will definitely treat it as a national issue. It can be proved by many events that the Taiyuan issue will be properly handled. From the plane, he saw that the fortifications in Taiyuan were very good, and the calmness and determination of the people in Bingzhou were even more infinite power. If the Communist army attacks without measuring its own strength, it is asking for destruction. There are still scattered Communist armies in Chahar Province, and the national army is encircling and suppressing them. In the narrow area of the border area between Chahar, Rehe, and Hebei, the Communist army forces the people to plant opium. Their intention is to protect them when we eradicate them in order to win over the people. Mr. Fu said with certainty that the CCP has failed. This conclusion was reached when Zhangjiakou was recovered. Not only in military and political aspects, but especially in economic policies, the people in the areas occupied or temporarily retained are all tired of the Communist Party. A party whose interests are inconsistent with the interests of the country and the people will never develop. However, it is inevitable that the people of North China will suffer in the short term due to its more than 20 years of history. The future of suppressing bandits is very bright. The Communist Party's mistakes have determined its future of destruction. I do not believe that those who violate history and national interests and the will of the people have any hope of success. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the White Wolf bandits entered Shanxi and occupied many cities and towns. Time is the deciding factor. When the time comes, the suppression of bandits will be successful.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] The military estimates that the total number of Communist troops in Shanxi is more than 22 divisions. It is possible that Liu Bocheng's troops will enter Shanxi, He Long will command the military affairs in the southern route, Peng Dehuai will command the military affairs in northwestern Shanxi in Kelan, Xiao Ke will command the military affairs in the northern route, and Nie Rongzhen will command the military affairs in the eastern route in Fuping, attempting to encircle Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] Battle situation in Southern Shanxi: (1) The national army in Anyi and Yuncheng has continued to receive air support in recent days. The 67th Brigade of the Communist army's Wang Yong department continued to shell the city on the 12th. The national army is holding on to the fortifications awaiting reinforcements. The situation has reached the final stage. Corpses are everywhere and the smell is pungent. (2) Linfen is still guarded by the national army. The Communist army's attacking force includes one brigade, four regiments, and one artillery regiment.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 13th Dispatch] According to captured Communist soldiers, the Communist army originally planned to launch a general attack on Yuncheng on the evening of the 10th, but failed due to the unfinished construction. Then, it was decided that each brigade would be responsible for one side on the evening of the 11th, mainly the southwest and northwest. Unexpectedly, the national army launched an attack on the 11th, inflicting heavy damage on them. The attempt to launch a general attack has been defeated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th Dispatch] The Communist army's 10th, 11th, 12th, 22nd, and 24th Brigades, as well as Sun Dingguo and Wang Tang's troops, and the independent regiments of Yuanqu and Jiyuan, a total of more than 30,000 people, are actively attacking the national army who are besieging the two cities of Anyi and Yuncheng. It is reported that the Communist army has now formed springboard, cloud ladder, and climbing groups, carrying a large amount of explosives and siege equipment, and working together to launch a fierce attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th Dispatch] The national army defending Yuncheng launched a powerful counterattack against the Communist army outside the city from noon on the 11th. With the coordinated operation of infantry and artillery, a total of two battalions of the 7,000th Regiment of the Communist army's 24th Brigade were annihilated. The Communist army slightly converged. At 12:00 that night, the Communist army regrouped and launched another fierce attack from the northeast, west, and three sides. By 2:00 AM on the 12th, they were all repelled by the national army. The Communist army suffered heavy casualties and the offensive was frustrated. The national army took advantage of the situation to pursue to places such as Gaojia Plateau and Huai Sh湾 to the northeast, and recovered many important strongholds. There are no Communist troops within ten miles outside the city. In addition, the Anyi garrison recovered the barracks in the east of the city on the 12th, and the Communist army was killed or injured more than 6,000 in one day.</p>

<h3>More Than One Million Refugees Flee from Communist-Controlled Areas in Northeast</h3>
<p>All Parties are Calling for Relief</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th Dispatch] The increasing number of refugees from Communist-controlled areas in the Northeast who are fleeing to the recovered areas due to unbearable pressure from the Communist army has aroused deep concern among the general public. It is estimated that more than one million refugees have fled from Communist-controlled areas in the Northeast in the past year, mostly scattered in Changchun, Shenyang, Siping, and Jilin. About one-third of them have found employment or have entered schools, while the rest are still threatened by hunger and cold. Although the 1 billion yuan in legal tender previously allocated by the Executive Yuan has now been distributed, each person only receives 1,500 yuan in circulating coupons, which has little effect in the current soaring prices in the Northeast. All parties are calling for relief.</p>

<h3>Shang Zhen Visits MacArthur for Long Conversation; Far Eastern Commission to Replace Council of Foreign Ministers as a Negotiation Body for the Japanese Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Shang Zhen, the new head of the Chinese mission to Japan, visited General MacArthur at 6:30 PM yesterday. This was Shang's first visit since arriving in Tokyo on May 10th. He was accompanied by the former head of the mission, Zhu Shimin, and the meeting lasted about an hour. Shang declined to disclose the content of the conversation but said that he enjoyed his meeting with MacArthur very much.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Diplomatic authorities here stated today that the Far Eastern Commission may break precedent and replace the Council of Foreign Ministers as the negotiating body for the Japanese peace treaty. It has not yet been decided which international organization should be used to conduct the negotiations. U.S. officials favor the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission, but the Soviet Union has repeatedly insisted that the major powers should decide the major post-war issues. It is reported that Britain and the United States favor the participation of representatives from countries that fought against Japan, such as Australia and Canada, from the beginning of the negotiations. When the four foreign ministers drafted peace treaties with European Axis satellites, these countries were excluded. The Potsdam Agreement of 1945 did not specifically entrust the four foreign ministers or the Far Eastern Commission to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. The Far Eastern Commission was established to deal with Japan, Korea, and other post-war issues in the Pacific region, and its authority has so far been limited to occupation issues. Since returning from Moscow, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall has given serious consideration to preparing for negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty, and MacArthur has also requested from Tokyo to accelerate the preparations.</p>

<h3>Burmese Returned Overseas Chinese Stranded in Guangzhou to Return Home Next Month</h3>
<p>No Problem with Employment after Arriving in Burma</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th] The number of Burmese returned overseas Chinese stranded in Guangzhou waiting to return home has reached over 4,000. They have been staying in Guangzhou for more than a year. Initially, the Food Relief Administration provided accommodation and food, but this stopped a month ago. To date, apart from the 400 or so who are temporarily staying in the hostels, the rest are scattered everywhere, and their lives are very difficult. Overseas Chinese leaders in Guangzhou have repeatedly petitioned the authorities to negotiate with the Burmese government as soon as possible to decide on specific measures for repatriating the returned overseas Chinese. According to information from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, regarding the repatriation of Burmese overseas Chinese, the Burmese government, feeling that the post-war environment has changed, is deeply concerned that problems will arise with the lives of the overseas Chinese after they return to Burma. Therefore, it has delayed making a concrete decision. Recently, the Burmese Chinese Association guaranteed that there would be absolutely no problem with employment for the returned overseas Chinese after arriving in Burma. Therefore, the Burmese government has decided to approve the repatriation of overseas Chinese. The representative dispatched by Burma to China to handle the visa for the repatriation of overseas Chinese has already arrived in Xiamen. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has telegraphed the Burmese government, requesting that the representative handling the visa come to Guangzhou. According to reports, the Burmese government has already approved this request. Therefore, the repatriation issue of the Burmese returned overseas Chinese has been largely resolved in principle, and they may be able to return home next month.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Requests Chinese Telecommunications Bureau to Switch to Landline Communications</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th] There are rumors that the Hong Kong government has notified the Chinese Telecommunications Bureau in Hong Kong to close down. According to Zou Maotong, Director of the Sixth District Telecommunications Administration, the Hong Kong side only requested that wireless communications be terminated at the end of May and switched to landline communications, but did not request closure. He personally went to Hong Kong for this matter and consulted with the Hong Kong Postmaster General on future communication methods. Zou said that China has been operating a telecommunications bureau in Hong Kong for more than 20 years, and has always used landline communications. After the war, due to the destruction of the landlines, the Hong Kong side agreed to temporarily use wireless communications. This time, the Hong Kong side's request is to restore the pre-war communication method. The landline from Guangzhou to Shenzhen within China has long been repaired. If the Hong Kong side can quickly repair the Hong Kong territory, it can be connected and pre-war conditions restored.</p>

This order is unrelated to the previously supplied railway materials. [Report from our Nanjing Office, 13th] All members of the General Officer Class of the Central Training Corps made three specific requests to the Education Director Huang on the 13th: (1) The demobilization allowance should be issued according to the current standard (400,000 yuan per month for a major general).

It is requested that the government be asked to issue 10 million yuan to each person to purchase books, organize academic research associations, and engage in cultural activities. (3) The four tasks to be handled for each officer: retirement, career change, further study, and retention, should be decided and handled separately before the end of May.

<h3>Philippines Plans to Amend Immigration Law, Further Restricting Entry of Overseas Chinese; Immigration Bureau to Submit to the President's Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 13th] The Philippine Immigration Bureau, in order to plan further restrictions on the entry of overseas Chinese into the Philippines, will soon submit several important amendments to the Immigration Law to the President's Office. The main amendments under consideration include (1) increasing the fee paid by foreigners traveling to the Philippines during the war, from US$500 to US$2,500. (2) Limiting tourists to the Philippines to a one-month stay, and issuing temporary visitor permits. (3) Temporarily prohibiting foreigners engaged in business from staying in the Philippines as temporary visitors. (4) Only foreigners who left the Philippines before the end of 1941 can obtain the special treatment for foreigners returning to the Philippines that is deserved. The new regulations for the entry of temporary visitors are intended to enable the government to check the activities of foreigners who originally entered the Philippines under temporary residence provisions. Current regulations allow temporary visitors to stay in the Philippines for one year, subject to a fee of US$500. Philippine Immigration Commissioner Fabre said that in order to curb the illegal entry of overseas Chinese, he has recommended the dispatch of two immigration investigation commissioners to Xiamen, Taiwan, and other Chinese ports.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 13th] The Philippine Senate has opposed the passage of the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty, believing that some of its provisions are too generous. The Senate's opposition is led by Senate Government Party Leader and Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Francisco, who is scheduled to submit the committee's report on the 14th. According to Senate sources, while Francisco has consistently opposed the "generous provisions" in the agreement, it is doubtful whether he will win the support of a majority of the members of the Foreign Relations Committee. Although Francisco had the support of a majority of the members some time ago, the situation has changed, as it is rumored that the President's Office is insisting on the early ratification of the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 13th] The Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship is currently awaiting approval by the Philippine Senate. The members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee differ on the terms of the treaty. Today, Chairman Francisco submitted a "no recommendation" memorandum to Senate President Avelino, stating: The members of the Foreign Relations Committee are divided on whether to agree to the terms or strongly request that Article 5, which governs immigration measures, be amended. It is up to the entire Senate to "decide on this action to improve national security." Francisco himself also opposes approving the treaty, so the memorandum also states that Article 5 should be amended in accordance with the same terms in the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation concluded last year, so that the Philippines can freely enact laws to manage the entry of Chinese immigrants. However, international trade merchants from both countries should enjoy the same rights as the people of any third country.</p>

<h3>Several Basic Questions Regarding Athletic Meets</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>The 7th National Games is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on Double Tenth Day (October 10th) this year, and preparations are in full swing. It was originally planned to be held in Beijing with a budget of 10 billion. In the autumn of post-war recovery, with everything waiting to be done, coupled with the economy being on the verge of bankruptcy, and everyone tightening their belts, there is naturally no such huge amount of idle money. Naturally, the authorities did not approve it. It was then changed to Shanghai to cope with the World Games next year, hoping to collect some ticket money to help cover expenses.</p>
<p>The original motive for this National Games was to cope with the World Games. Speaking of China's participation in the World Games, there is indeed a painful history full of emotion. Lesson drawn from the past can guide one in the future, so we should reflect deeply on the pain. The World Games was originally called the Summer Olympics, founded in ancient Greece more than 2,710 years ago. At that time, all four borders of Greece were enemies, and the government and people were under the oppression of strong neighbors. For the sake of defense, they vigorously promoted martial arts to cultivate the spirit of endurance, bravery, and combat. Turning the pages of Greek education history, the two major subjects of physical education and music dazzle our eyes. Just like in ancient China since the Shang and Zhou dynasties, education emphasized ritual, music, archery, and horsemanship. Greek music belonged to intellectual education, used to cultivate the people's patriotism and religious heart, and taught them by putting the words and deeds of heroes into musical canons. However, relying solely on music was not enough to resist insults, so physical education was used to train the national body. Therefore, athletic meets became a display of the people's health achievements for encouragement.</p>
<p>The athletic events included running, high jump, javelin, discus (made of metal or stone at the time, i.e., the current discus), and wrestling. These five competitions became the famous pentathlon, which was a very important thing in the Summer Olympics because a person who could excel in these five sports was an expert in all kinds of sports. These sports were very important to Greece, coming around every four years. The four-year period between two Summer Olympics was called "Olympiad." The requirements for participants in the Summer Olympics were extremely strict. They had to be citizens of pure Greek descent, and they had to have not violated religion and the state as prerequisites. All athletes had to be able to endure long-term hard training. Many young people dreamed of victory in the Summer Olympics on the track, so that they could receive the honorary reward of a wild olive wreath on their heads.</p>
<p>Today's World Games originated from the Summer Olympics. Unfortunately, over time, abuses arose, so the Roman Pope ordered it to be stopped in 394 AD. It was not until 1892 that Mr. Coubertin, a French expert in Greek literature, recognized the special contribution of the ancient Summer Olympics to culture and called for its revival, so the interrupted athletic meet was revived in 1896, and it continued to follow the ancient tradition. The 11th was held in Berlin in 1936, and China was invited to participate, not hesitating to spend 200,000 yuan and send a large team of people on the first long march of ten thousand miles.</p>
<p>The 139 representatives who participated in the Berlin World Games were miserably wiped out. Not to mention that the famous generals in various men's and women's races were eliminated, even the famous basketball team that had won against Peru could not compete. According to the report, we had 24 penalty shot opportunities, and we were asked to stand still and shoot the ball steadily, but who knew we missed every time. This shows that our physical strength is not as good as others, and our nerves are not stable or healthy!</p>
<p>If you want to know the purpose of athletic meets, you can get a full picture from Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Sixth National Games. He said: "The purpose of sports is to seek the average development of each individual's mind and body, so as to create a sound physique and a strong spirit. The purpose of competition is to cultivate the virtues of discipline, cooperation, courage, and obedience in regulated actions. …It should encourage the progress of the entire nation and revitalize the basic work of the nation… The great cause of national revival in the future should be built on the foundation of sports." The Soviet Union's athletic meets were mass physical performances, aimed at military preparation and increasing the height and weight of new recruits to the Red Army. They also admitted that "mass physical training is mass political training." No wonder at the last "Sports Day," Stalin and Molotov led 5,000 men and women from 16 Soviet republics in collective calisthenics in front of 50,000 people in Moscow, showing the world their healthy bodies.</p>
<p>After looking at the lessons of athletic meets from ancient times to the present and from China and abroad, we want to raise a few basic questions to alert everyone: (1) The purpose of sports is to train the body and cultivate the strength to defend the country; (2) We must cultivate a sporting atmosphere, so that social citizens and school students all have the habit of daily exercise; (3) We cannot expose ourselves to the sun for one day and then freeze for ten days. Society must provide more sports environments. The existing sports fields in Beijing and Shanghai should be used every day and be crowded with people. How can we discard them like worn-out shoes, let them be overgrown with weeds, with grass growing as tall as people, and iron locks rusting so they cannot be opened; (4) Schools should have qualified sports fields, and in the future, they should have gymnasiums and swimming pools. We can have fewer classrooms, but sports space cannot be lacking. We can have fewer books, but sports equipment must be available. Failure in sports still means not graduating; (5) Physical education teachers and sports supervisors must be cultivated in large numbers quickly, and all normal school graduates must be able to serve as physical education teachers.</p>
<p>Currently, the basic work at the bottom of the athletic meet is a major problem. Even the plan of the Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education has been shelved due to lack of funding. Then, should we continue to do superficial decoration that wastes money and manpower? The World Games requires the National Games to produce athletes, and the National Games relies on local athletic meets to produce athletes, plus training and re-election procedures. The funding for this series of activities is considerable, and I am afraid that 20 billion yuan is not enough. Shouldn't we save some funds to train more physical education teachers, add more sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and equipment, and do a few years of solid work to build the foundation of national life, and then attend the World Games is not too late? If we are not prepared at all, temporarily embracing the Buddha's feet, and perform another tragedy of total defeat with a tired and disabled body, it will inevitably turn from a deep wound into a "blood collapse and pus eruption." Wouldn't it be for the sake of face, but instead be burdened by face and lose all face? Why bother? The World Games is a performance ground for the national strength of various countries, so we really cannot help but work hard in a down-to-earth manner. This is not only for the World Games, but also the future of the nation depends on it.</p>

<h3>Socialist Party Opposes Expanding Government; Political Crisis Erupts in Italy; Gasperi Cabinet Submits Resignation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 13th Broadcasting: As the Italian Socialist Party and the Christian Democratic Party mutually blame each other for the collapse of the coalition government, Prime Minister Gasperi suddenly submitted his resignation to Interim President Nicola today.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 13th Broadcasting: Italian Minister of Public Works Romita declared that Prime Minister Gasperi and the cabinet will submit their resignations today. Romita told reporters after the end of the emergency cabinet meeting that Gasperi had decided to resign because the Socialist Party accused him of intentionally creating a political crisis. The Italian government has collapsed due to differences of opinion, the biggest reason being the national debt issue.</p>
<p>[United Press] Rome, 13th: Italian Prime Minister Gasperi has submitted his resignation today. Gasperi, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, has served as the Prime Minister of the coalition cabinet since December 1945. He recently visited the United States, hoping to obtain more economic support and reduce the burden of the Italian peace treaty. Gasperi expressed his intention to resign to the President this morning, and after convening an emergency cabinet meeting, he submitted the resignation of himself and the entire cabinet to the Italian President. The reason for the total resignation of the cabinet is that the Socialist Party does not agree with Gasperi's plan to invite all political parties to participate in expanding the cabinet. The Socialist Party itself is willing to merge with the Communist Party. Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party also attacked Gasperi's weakness and inability to get rid of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>All indications show that the United States is trying to weaken the power of the left wing in Italy. The US Ambassador to Italy declared: "The United States has never made any suggestions to Gasperi, and Gasperi has never inquired about any opinions from the United States." However, it is believed that Gasperi, after visiting the United States and meeting with President Truman and senior American officials, has decided to organize a government that excludes the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Britain Clarifies Position on Greece; Troops Currently Not Withdrawing; American War Equipment Continuously Shipped to Greece</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] London, 12th: A Foreign Office spokesman stated today that the US Congress's approval of the aid bill to Greece does not mean that all British troops stationed in Greece will automatically withdraw. These two issues are not necessarily related. Britain only intends to recall its economic delegation from Greece in July. However, according to the British-Greek agreement, 1,200 British army, navy, and air force representatives will remain stationed in Greece to continue training the Greek army. It is not yet known when other British troops stationed in Greece will "complete their mission." Britain supports Greece's amnesty for political prisoners, while also taking into account its internal security. However, the British government believes that it is doubtful whether recommending that the Greek government grant amnesty to the detained political prisoners falls within the scope of the mandate of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee.</p>
<p>[Reuters] Rome, 12th: The Italian news agency reports: American tanks, armored vehicles, and other war equipment, carried by the Greek ships "Ilthis" and "Babe," sailed to Greece from the Italian port of Livorno.</p>
<h3>Greek Anti-Communist Bill Submitted to Parliament for Discussion</h3>
<p>[United Press] Athens, 12th: The National Assembly met today, and 30 members, led by Deputy Speaker Jiang Nadasi, proposed a bill to outlaw the Greek Communist Party, pointing out that the Communist Party's platform is to overthrow the government by violence, making it a party that endangers national interests. Liberal Party members expressed their opposition, believing that members do not have the right to propose important bills. Foreign Minister Tsaldaris believes that members have the right to propose any measures. However, the bill proposed by right-wing members is in conflict with the views of the US Embassy, which believes that forcing the Communist Party into an underground party will only increase its opposition forces, and that the actions of the government supported by the United States will be anti-democratic, even though it wants to join Western democratic countries. Congressional observers believe that the purpose of submitting this bill to the Congress now is to enact strong anti-communist measures before the arrival of the American delegation to Greece.</p>
<h3>Final Legislative Process for US Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill</h3>
<p>[Reuters] Washington, 12th: The US aid bill to Greece and Turkey was submitted to the joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives today for final review. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on Friday. However, the Senate refused to accept the contents passed by the House of Representatives because it believed that the contents passed by the House of Representatives were different from the contents passed by the Senate. The purpose of today's meeting is to reconcile the two. The main difference between the two is only that the House bill has deleted the declaration of general policy in the introductory chapter of the bill, and the provision that the appointment of the head of the US mission to Greece and Turkey must be approved by the Senate. Therefore, it is expected that there will not be any difficulties during the discussion. [Agence France-Presse] Washington, 12th: Well-informed sources recently declared that President Truman may sign the aid bill to Greece and Turkey tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>Korean Issue Enters Important Amendment Stage; US Submits Another Note to the Soviet Union; Whether Negotiations Can Resume Depends on Soviet Response</h3>
<p>[US Information Service] Success Lake, 12th: The US Embassy in the Soviet Union was ordered today to submit a new note to the Soviet government regarding the resumption of the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea. A State Department spokesman said: This new note is a reply to the note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on May 8, and Molotov's note is a reply to the note from Secretary of State Marshall on May 2, regarding the restoration of the US-Soviet Commission in order to establish a Korean interim government in the US-Soviet occupied zones. The spokesman declined to comment on these notes, only saying: The new US note requires a response from the other party. Marshall's note on May 2 was the third note regarding the mission of the US-Soviet Joint Commission, outlining the US interpretation of the Moscow Agreement on the Korean issue. Marshall explained the US government's position, saying that the Commission should not refuse representatives from Korean democratic political parties and social organizations to participate in consultations when discussing the Korean interim government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press] Washington, 12th: Secretary of State Marshall today submitted a third note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, demanding that conditions be negotiated first before resuming the work of the US-Soviet Joint Commission. The full text of the note has not been released, but officials said that unless a satisfactory response is received, preparations for the resumption of negotiations in Seoul on May 20 will be shelved.</p>
<h3>Martial Law on Iraqi Border</h3>

<h3>Four-Power Commission Meets to Discuss Ways to Resolve Austrian Treaty</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] Vienna, 12th: The Austrian Treaty Commission met today at the Industry Building here to deal with the resolution of the Austrian issue. The first meeting was devoted to discussing the ways and procedures for handling the issue. Photographers were not allowed to enter the meeting. It is said that another meeting will be held tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Possible Further Changes to Senior US State Department Officials; Branden and Fenton May Also Resign</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] Washington, 12th: White House Press Secretary Ross recently told the press that Under Secretary of State Acheson has submitted his resignation, which has been approved by President Truman. The President plans to submit the name of former Assistant Secretary of the Army Lovett to the Senate as Acheson's successor in the near future. Acheson's resignation will take effect on June 30. According to well-informed sources, it is also possible that Assistant Secretaries of State Branden and Fenton will submit their resignations. Recently, Congress has severely criticized Branden and Fenton, believing that the former's policy towards Argentina is too firm, and the latter's handling of the State Department's intelligence and propaganda work is inappropriate. Acheson has always been a supporter of Branden, and his resignation will weaken Branden's position, especially since Lovett's policy towards South American countries is very different from Branden's, so his position will be even weaker. Acheson joined the State Department in 1941 as an Assistant Secretary, and was appointed Under Secretary of State by former Secretary of State Byrnes on August 16, 1945. After the death of former President Roosevelt, he strongly defended Byrnes' policy and the Truman Doctrine, and also tried his best to defend Secretary of State Marshall's attacks from Congress, so his position was very important. Defending his superiors was Acheson's main occupation, because important decisions were made by Byrnes, Truman, and Marshall, and Acheson had no power to make any policy decisions. Acheson was fluent, sincere, and repeatedly attended the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees to advocate for loans to Britain and loans to Greece and Turkey. He made great contributions to the State Department. According to this question, people said: At present, it is still necessary to wait for Lovett to attend the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees to determine whether he will continue the tradition of his predecessor after he is appointed Under Secretary of State. The US government has a tendency to leave important positions to soldiers or people who are familiar with military affairs, but the appointment of Lovett as Under Secretary of State seems to break this tendency, because Lovett is a banker. The liberal minority in the United States has repeatedly criticized the government for the excessive number of soldiers holding important positions at home and abroad.</p>

<h3>Issue of Palestinian Independence Not Included in Investigation Agenda; UN Political Committee Passes French Proposal</h3>
<p>[US Information Service] Success Lake, 12th: The UN Political Committee voted today to delete the provisions relating to Palestinian independence from the instructions to the special committee investigating the Palestinian dispute. This case was proposed by France. Before the vote, several speakers pointed out that this issue had already been stipulated in the previous agreement on the order to the investigation committee, that is, to grant the committee "the greatest power to identify the truth of the facts and investigate all issues and proposals related to Palestine." As a result of the vote, 29 countries voted in favor of the deletion, 14 countries voted against it, 10 countries abstained, and 2 countries were absent. Among the five powers, only the Soviet Union voted against it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press] Success Lake, 12th: The UN Political Committee's vote to avoid discussing independence by the Palestinian Fact-Finding Committee is a defeat for the Arab Group and a victory for the Jewish Congress. It caused a heated debate at the time, with spokespersons from both the Arab and Jewish sides using malicious words against each other. [Associated Press] Minneapolis, 12th: Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace said in a speech at a banquet of the Non-Partisan Voters Association: The National Anti-Communist Conference is a disgrace. President Truman's test of government officials' loyalty is also not an appropriate measure. Communists should also be regarded as human beings and should not be imprisoned. I recently traveled to Europe and found that everything is open and there is a healthy political climate in all countries. Therefore, I think the United States should be the same. Wallace continued that if the United States can weave freedom and let it move, then I will participate in the presidential migration.</p>

<h3>Difficulties Persist in Forming Japanese Cabinet - Opposition Party Dissatisfied with Socialist Party's Economic Policies - Choice of New Premier is the Biggest Problem</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] On the morning of the 13th, the Liberal Party held an executive meeting to review the results of the four-party secretary-general talks on the 12th. Regarding the emergency breakthrough plan for the economic crisis proposed by the Socialist Party, it was considered to be a socialist-based plan on the Socialist Party's side. A proposal closer to the Liberal Party must be drafted before consultations can proceed. Regarding the allocation ratio of cabinet ministers, Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio proposed that the Socialist Party would get the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Forestry, Minister of Transportation, and Minister of Health, a total of five ministers. The Liberal Party would get the Minister of Interior, Minister of Justice, Minister of Commerce and Industry, and two ministers without portfolio. The Democratic Party would get the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Communications, and three ministers without portfolio. The People's Cooperative Party would get the Minister of Education. At the same time, Secretary-General Nishio proposed that the positions of Cabinet Secretary and Director-General of the Legislative Bureau should be appointed by the Prime Minister from within the Socialist Party. At that time, Secretary-General Ono immediately reminded Nishio to pay attention to the attitude of organizing a coalition cabinet. There was no resolution in today's executive meeting.</p>
<p>[International News Service, Tokyo, 13th] According to observers, the biggest problem currently hindering the formation of a coalition cabinet is the selection of the cabinet leader. If the Socialist Party can use its flexible skills to obtain the consent of all parties for Tetsu Katayama to head the cabinet, then there should be no other thorny issues in the future of the coalition cabinet.</p>
<h3>UN Investigation Team on Greek Border Incidents – Soviet Union Proposes Reducing Powers and Recommends Moving Headquarters to Athens</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] Tonight, the Soviet Union re-raised the issue of Greece at the UN Security Council. Soviet representative Gromyko spoke for 35 minutes, demanding a major reduction in the powers of the UN investigation team on the Greek border disputes, limiting it to the specific cases designated by the Balkan Investigation Committee, and moving the team's headquarters from Thessaloniki on the border to Athens. It is said that the presence of the commission in Thessaloniki may encourage the activities of some irresponsible and opportunistic elements in Greece, which is extremely dangerous from the perspective of maintaining local peace. Previously, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria refused to cooperate with the team, declaring their opposition to investigating their borders. With Soviet support, the case was raised in the Security Council tonight. The Security Council's Balkan Investigation Committee and the Greek border dispute investigation team are both organized by eleven member states. The investigation committee is now in Geneva, compiling reports to be submitted to the Security Council.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University's Two Thousand Students Arrive at Zhenru by Truck - Minister of Education Rushes Over Late at Night to Persuade Them - Government Accepts All Demands, But Students Still Insist on Going to the Capital - North Railway Station in Turmoil All Day, Passengers on Two Lines Blocked</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] More than 2,000 students from National Jiaotong University, in order to oppose the Ministry of Education's change of the school's name and the discontinuation of the navigation management and marine engineering departments, launched a large-scale petition movement to the capital yesterday. At eight o'clock in the morning, the students boarded forty-eight trucks and drove to the North Railway Station. After Mayor Wu heard the news, he rushed to the school in advance and tried his best to dissuade them, but to no avail. Vice Minister Tian Peilin of the Ministry of Education also rushed to Jiaotong University at the same time to meet with President Wu and convened a meeting of Dean Li, Dean Gu, the heads of various departments, and all professors and associate professors, with more than 80 people attending. In addition to Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Chairman Fang Zhi, Director Zhao Zengjue, and Director Gu Yuxiu were also invited to the school to discuss the matter. Mr. Tian, on behalf of Minister Zhu, gave the following affirmative replies to the demands made by the students of the school: (1) Jiaotong University will never change its name, and will never discontinue any departments. (2) The marine engineering department will be merged into the shipbuilding department, and the shipbuilding department will be renamed the shipbuilding and marine engineering department, which still belongs to the School of Engineering. The navigation department will be changed to the navigation management department, which belongs to the School of Management. (3) The school's funding will be increased according to actual needs, on par with other universities. (4) The number of employees will be increased according to regulations, based on the number of classes and students. (5) If there are any unfulfilled matters, teachers, students, and alumni can send representatives to the capital to discuss them in person. The above points were signed by Vice Minister Tian and President Wu, and all those present also signed, and Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Director Zhao, and Director Gu were jointly signed as witnesses to show solemnity. However, at this time, the students of the school were still gathering at the North Railway Station waiting for the train to prepare to go to the capital. Mayor Wu and others immediately rushed to the station to persuade them, and President Wu reported the five measures replied by Vice Minister Tian in writing and orally, and strongly urged the students to return to school. At the same time, the North Railway Station had also received a telegram from Nanjing, saying that Minister Zhu had decided to take a special plane from the capital to Shanghai with Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Education, which was expected to arrive around 2:00 PM. Mayor Wu and others persuaded the students to send representatives to meet Minister Zhu, but the students firmly refused to elect representatives and continued to wait at the station, demanding that Minister Zhu come to the station. The 6th train at 9:00 AM, the 8th express train at 11:00 AM, and the Jinling train at 1:30 PM were still able to leave Shanghai. All subsequent trains were blocked.</p>

<h3>President Writes Proclamation Urging Return to School and Resumption of Classes</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM, Minister Zhu and Vice Minister Ling of the Ministry of Education flew from the capital to Shanghai. Minister Zhu first went to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Wu, and Vice Minister Ling rushed to the North Railway Station, hoping to persuade the students to return to school in the capacity of an alumnus of Jiaotong University, and send representatives to meet Minister Zhu to discuss everything, but it was still ineffective. At about 3:00 PM, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Secretary-General Wu Shaoshu, Commander Xuan, and others went from the North Railway Station to the Municipal Government to discuss solutions with Minister Zhu, and then rushed back to the North Railway Station at 4:30 PM. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Secretary-General Wu, and others acted as mediators and solemnly declared to the students that Minister Zhu had agreed that Jiaotong University would never change its name and allowed the Department of Marine Engineering to be independent. At that time, President Wu Baofeng of Jiaotong University personally wrote a large proclamation, which was posted at the station with eight points: (1) Minister Zhu has allowed the school to set up the Department of Marine Engineering independently. (2) All other clauses discussed and decided by Vice Minister Tian and the school's professor meeting have been fully agreed to by Minister Zhu. (3) The purpose of the student's movement to protect the school has been fully achieved. (4) If the students still need to see Minister Zhu, Minister Zhu is allowed to meet with student representatives at the Central Research Institute on Qiqi Road. (5) Now that the school protection movement has been completed, the school's students should immediately withdraw from the station and return to school and attend classes tomorrow morning. (6) Those who have not left the station by 9:00 PM today or who do not attend class tomorrow morning will be expelled from school. (7) The school will not be responsible for any actions of expelled students. (8) All the above articles, all students who love our school, hope to abide by them together. To maintain the school's reputation. Wu Baofeng, President of Jiaotong University. In addition, the content of the proclamation was broadcast through loudspeakers to ensure that all students knew it. However, the students not only did not comply, but their emotions became more intense and insisted on going to the capital to petition. The station's loudspeakers were also destroyed, and the student representatives could no longer convey the opinions of both parties, and it seemed that there was no way to resolve the situation.</p>
<h3>Students Drive the Train Forward</h3>
<p>The students then boarded the train and the students drove the locomotive themselves, leaving the North Railway Station and heading forward. The responsible authorities of the city, in order to prevent the situation from escalating, asked the railway bureau to notify the students that there were sections of track ahead that had been dismantled, hoping that the students would not drive forward automatically. At the same time, in order to prevent any eventuality, Commander Xuan ordered a warning and sent all the passengers waiting for the train out of the station, and the North Railway Station implemented a full curfew inside and outside. After a while, Li Jun, the head of the 4th Regiment of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, led all the officers and soldiers of the 2nd Battalion of the regiment to the station. At the same time, the police team of the police station and the military police company of the North Railway Station had arrived at the station to perform warning tasks respectively. The 2nd Battalion of the Youth Army took a special train to the vicinity of Maigen Road Station to dissuade them from moving forward. It was already 7:00 PM. At about 9:00 PM, President Wu, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, and alumni of Jiaotong University, Vice Minister Ling Hongxun, Director Zhao Zukang, Director Zhao Zengyu, and professors, etc., rushed to Maigen Road Station one after another, persuading them bitterly, and the alumni association specially prepared dozens of public transport buses to take the students back. At the same time, President Wu distributed 2,000 copies of the printed proclamation separately, so that the students could understand the content and have a final consideration. However, the students were still unable to accept the advice because the leaders were absent, and they installed the dismantled tracks and continued to drive. By 12:00 PM, the train had arrived near Zhenru. The railway bureau dismantled the tracks west of Zhenru to prevent the train from continuing to move forward. Mayor Wu and others left Maigen Road Station to the Central Research Institute to discuss with Minister Zhu. Minister Zhu said that the president had issued a solemn proclamation and should follow it. He was very concerned about the students driving to Zhenru automatically, and took a car to Zhenru at 1:30 AM late at night to give a speech to the students and persuade them to return to Shanghai. However, as of press time, the students still showed no signs of returning to school.</p>
<p>Jinan University Students Rush to North Railway Station</p>
<p>Another report: One hundred and fifty to sixty students from Jinan University, in order to support the petition of Jiaotong University students, lined up and went to the North Railway Station last night. They arrived at 10:30 PM. The police officers responsible for the alert did not stop them at the time. The students of Jinan University only learned after entering the station that the students of Jiaotong University had driven away from the North Railway Station and were blocked at Maigen Road Station. The students of Jinan University first tried to walk along the railway line to Maigen Road Station, but were stopped by the police authorities, so they withdrew from the North Railway Station at 11:00 PM and prepared to go to Maigen Road Station by detour.

Mr. Zhu said in his speech that he had already agreed to the requests of the students and hoped that they would return to school quickly and not be obsessed with their mistakes.

<h3>China Merchants Bureau Purchases US Tugs - Solid Hull and Perfect Equipment - Customs Sends Personnel to Inspect</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau purchased a total of more than 100 ships, including US repair ships, pontoons, iron barges, crane ships, and ocean tugs in the Philippines. Of the ocean tugs that have arrived in Shanghai, there are 18, of which three were allocated to the Supply Bureau and 15 were retained. Some are still under repair.

<h3>Li Shengwu's Suspected Treason Case: High Court Summons Xia Zhongming to Inquire About the Takeover of the Shanghai Special District Court; Capital High Court Sends Letter to Investigate Five Points</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Xia Zhongming, former Vice Minister of the puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, was summoned by the High Court yesterday afternoon to testify. This was due to a letter from the Capital Higher Court, which stated in brief: "This court is handling the retrial of the case of Li Shengwu's suspected treason. According to the defendant, the Action Committee for Taking Over the Shanghai Special District Court was established in the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940] by the puppet Executive Yuan, which appointed Wang Hanzhang, the puppet Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, as its convener, and had nothing to do with the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration. The defendant secretly delayed and sabotaged the takeover, procrastinating for as long as half a year. Later, Wang Jingwei issued a hand order to cancel the committee, and Li Shiqun sent Xia Zhongming and others with armed forces to assist the Japanese military police in forcibly taking over the court. Regarding (1) the date of the takeover of the French Concession and the International Settlement; (2) whether Xia Zhongming participated in the takeover; (3) whether the takeover was carried out under the order of the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration; (4) whether the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration sent personnel to participate in the takeover; and (5) detailed information on the takeover process." The above five points are requested to be investigated by our Municipal High Court. According to Xia Zhongming's testimony yesterday, "When Li Shengwu served as the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration, I served as an inspector in the puppet Police Administration Department and often lived in Nanjing. I did not take over the Shanghai Special District Court. However, I later heard that Geng Jiaji and the French national Du Ge were sent to take over, which is all on record." He claimed to know nothing about other circumstances. After completing his testimony, he was returned to custody in the detention center.</p>

<h3>Gradually Decreasing Base Salary System; Wu Kaixian Explains the Calculation Method</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday, an evening newspaper reported that the cost of living index for this month has been determined to be 15,000 times, but Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau refuted the rumor, calling it absurd. Director Wu said: It is currently only mid-May, so how could the May index be available? The cost of living index for April was approximately 14,800 times, which was proposed as a reference when discussing the unfreezing [of salaries]. The index for this month will inevitably increase compared to that. Regarding the explanation of the progressively decreasing discount of 10% for each 10 yuan increment above the base salary of 30 yuan, it means that those below 30 yuan will be paid according to the full index, those from 30 yuan to 40 yuan will be calculated at 90%, those from 40 yuan to 50 yuan will be calculated at 80%, those from 50 yuan to 60 yuan will be calculated at 70%, those from 60 yuan to 70 yuan will be calculated at 60%, those from 70 yuan to 80 yuan will be calculated at 50%, those from 80 yuan to 90 yuan will be calculated at 40%, and those from 90 yuan to 100 yuan will be calculated at 30%. Those above 100 yuan will all be calculated at 30%.</p>

<h3>After Dealing with the Jiaotong University Student Unrest, Minister Zhu Will Fly to the Capital Today; The Ministry Absolutely Has No Intention to Rename Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After Minister Zhu Jiahua's speech to the students of Jiaotong University in Zhenru late last night, he is scheduled to fly back to Nanjing this morning due to important official business. It is reported that Minister Zhu will instruct Principal Wu to handle the students who are unwilling to return to school according to the announcement.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The students of National Jiaotong University went on strike the day before yesterday. After repeated persuasion by the Ministry of Education proved ineffective, the students gathered at the train station again yesterday morning, demanding to take the train to the capital to petition. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua attached great importance to this upon hearing the news and flew to Shanghai from the capital yesterday afternoon. After getting off the plane, he held discussions with various parties and instructed Wu Baofeng, the president of Jiaotong University, to order the students to leave the station and return to school immediately to earnestly rectify education and maintain social order. At the same time, he sent representatives to talk with the Academia Sinica. When the students refused to comply, Zhu then told Principal Wu, "(1) The students are gathering in crowds and occupying the station, obstructing traffic and acting excessively. They should be ordered to return to school immediately to earnestly rectify education and maintain social order. (2) The two specialized subjects of marine engineering and driving at Jiaotong University were originally temporarily handled by Jiaotong University during the Anti-Japanese War because the Wusong Merchant Marine School, which was relocated to Chongqing, caused trouble and was suspended. Last year, the specialized school was restored, and the ministry ordered that it be managed by that school again. In terms of the school system, this is extremely reasonable. He barely acceded to the Shanghai authorities' and local people's concern for the security of Shanghai and temporarily allowed the school's School of Management to add a maritime management department, and the School of Engineering to add a marine engineering department. As for the two specialized subjects, they will still be handled according to the previous order until each class graduates. (3) Regarding the rumors of renaming Jiaotong University, etc., the Ministry absolutely has no such intention. Principal Wu has already stated this on record. Moreover, the Ministry has always valued the long history and past achievements of Jiaotong University and will spare no effort to seek the development of the school. The facts are all there, and they are well known to the alumni of the school."</p>

<h3>Yilan, Taiwan Province, Will Establish a Motherland Historical Relics Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Airmail Report] Feng Weinong, the principal of the Provincial Yilan Agricultural Vocational School in Yilan City, Taiwan Province, believes that during the 50 years of Taiwan's occupation, it was subject to enslaved education and deception.

<h3>Medical Education Conference Discusses the System of Medical and Pharmaceutical Education Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The Medical Education Conference continued to be held at the Ministry of Education all day on the 13th, with 78 to 88 people attending. Chairman Liu Ruiheng presented the review results of the six groups of medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, nursing, midwifery, and health education. After that, the conference conducted a comprehensive discussion, added opinions separately, and conducted a detailed study of the academic system curriculum and implementation of medical and pharmaceutical education. Regarding "medical education," both the United Kingdom and the United States admit university graduates and then study for another four years before practicing medicine. China, in order to suit the national conditions, could not adopt a dual-track system, on the one hand, to increase the years of advanced study in medical colleges from a theoretical point of view, and on the other hand, to train medical personnel through specialized and specialized fields from a practical point of view. Only a single-track system can be implemented to cultivate universally applicable medical personnel to meet social needs. Regarding "medical education," in the vertical aspect, such as medical colleges and vocational medical schools for specialties and nurses and midwives, a three-track system is adopted due to the different levels. In the horizontal aspect, attention is paid to the mutual connection and cooperation of medical schools at all levels to achieve balanced development. In addition, after the revision of the curriculum textbook standards for medical education, medical talents can be increased and improved in the future.</p>

The Hong Kong team took the lead with a score of 3 to 2 in the first half. There were more than 8,000 spectators, and the atmosphere was not enthusiastic. West United suffered a miserable defeat due to the lack of strength of its defenders and the careless performance of goalkeeper McNitty. The starting lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Inter-Port</p>
<p>Glasscock, Sullivan, Hou Rongsheng, Liu Songsheng, Jie Li, Hibbert, Xie Jinhe, Li Zhaorong, Zhang Jinhai, Zou Wenzhi, He Yingfen</p>
<p>Shanghai West United</p>
<p>Novgorod, McNitty, Savin, Chelinkov, Sharonyin, Tiffani, Mallory, Grinas, Robert Stov, Kapustin, He Yingfen, Kapustin</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>Referee Shen Huichun, linesmen Zhang Le and Deng Xiaoliang. The Hong Kong team kicked off. After seven minutes, Zou Wenzhi got the ball and went deep. Just as he was about to try a shot, McNitty rushed out and missed. Tiffani hurried to the front of the goal and accidentally scored an own goal, giving Hong Kong the lead. After 14 minutes, Grinas shot a cold arrow from 25 yards away, and the Hong Kong goal was breached, making it 1-1. Seven minutes later, West United's Novgorod took a corner kick with a very good landing point. Kapustin headed the ball, which hit Sullivan's foot and bounced in, giving West United a 2-1 lead. After 37 minutes, Zhang Jinhai pulled the door from 20 yards away, and McNitty missed again, tying the score at 2-2. One minute later, Jin Hai passed to Liu Lang, who scored a goal, giving Hong Kong a 3-2 lead in the first half.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>After a break, the Hong Kong lineup remained unchanged. The Hong Kong army immediately launched an attack. Jin Hai passed the ball through the middle, and Li Zhaorong got the ball and rushed forward to knock it in. McNitty's save was unstable, and the ball bounced out not far away. Zhaorong added another kick, breaking McNitty's goal again (4-2) only one minute after the start of the half. The Hong Kong team's offensive was in full swing but did not achieve anything until the 20th minute when Jin Hai got the ball and passed it to the right. He Yingfen scored a low shot into the net (5-2). Five minutes later, West United's Novgorod passed the ball in from the left, making it 3-5. West United continued to work hard. Novgorod's corner kick was sent in, and Mallory flicked it in front of the goal, chasing the score to 4-5. However, the good times did not last. In less than a minute, Zhaorong blocked a gap, and Jin Hai scored a goal, making it 6-4. In the last minute, Xie Jinhe shot in from the left, and the time ended immediately, giving the Hong Kong army a 7-4 victory.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Yingtze University Petitioning Delegation Came to Shanghai Yesterday to State Their Position; They Would Rather Disband If the School Relocation Issue Is Not Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Yingtze University petitioning delegation, which was blocked halfway during its trip to the capital, was persuaded by Chairman Shen and Director Li of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allow the students to send ten representatives to the capital first, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Yingtze University petitioning delegation, in view of the fact that previous petitioning representatives have returned without success, will no longer suffer oppression and wear and tear in this petitioning endeavor. Specifically, representatives Huang Chuqing and Dong Fuguan were dispatched to Shanghai yesterday to state the position of all students of the school to the newspapers. The main points are as follows: (1) School site issue: absolutely leave Jinhua. If the Ministry of Education still does not consider a solution, they would rather disband and will never give up halfway. (2) Principal issue: The Ministry of Education has repeatedly stated that the principal has already been internally appointed, but it is incomprehensible why the appointment has been delayed. It is hoped that the Ministry of Education will immediately announce the new principal's choice when the representatives arrive in the capital. (3) Restoration of the Medical School: This time, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education has explained to the petitioning representatives of Chinese universities across the country that the Ministry of Education has not specified that the Chinese Department of the Yingtze University Medical School will no longer enroll students. Therefore, the school should be returned to Yingtze University from today and start enrolling students during the summer vacation this year.</p>

<h3>Tea Market Lacks Vitality</h3>
<p>The foreign-managed tea market, which has been sluggish for a long time, continued to be dull yesterday due to the persistent lack of buying interest, with little actual trading. The future outlook is precarious. As for red and green teas exclusively for domestic sale, the process remains stable, as supply and demand are balanced, with little fluctuation in sentiment and prices similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Rice Rationing for Public and Educational Personnel; Social Affairs Bureau Preparing Quickly; Limited Rice Arrivals and Rising Asking Prices Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Since the authorities decided to ration rice monthly to teachers and staff of private primary and secondary schools in the city, boarding students in public and private universities and secondary schools, factory workers, and the poor, the Social Affairs Bureau has stopped selling 9,000 bags of white japonica rice daily on the market since the 12th. The Social Affairs Bureau will publish the application form formats for rice rationing for schools and factories in the newspapers today. Schools and factories can then prepare the forms according to these formats and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau. Mr. Wu Kaixian acknowledged that rice prices might fluctuate during the period before the cessation of rice sales and before the implementation of rice rationing, so the Social Affairs Bureau is preparing the rationing as quickly as possible. Due to the urgency, the rationing and sale may be implemented before the official document from the Food Administration arrives. Yesterday, 2,997.5 shi of rice arrived at the North City Market, and 887 shi arrived at the South City Market. Asking prices rose compared to the previous day, with prices in the South City being higher than those in the North City. High-quality white japonica rice was priced at 310,000 yuan, medium-quality at 305,000 yuan, and low-quality at 300,000 yuan. High-quality Bo Dao rice was priced at 305,000 yuan, medium-quality at 300,000 yuan, and low-quality at 295,000 yuan. High-quality early rice was priced at 293,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan, and low-quality at 285,000 yuan. High-quality Yang Xian rice was priced at 300,000 yuan, and medium-quality at 295,000 yuan. High-quality Bai Yuan rice was priced at 310,000 yuan, medium-quality at 300,000 yuan, and low-quality at 290,000 yuan. High-quality Yin Yuan rice was priced at 305,000 yuan, and medium-quality at 294,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, more than 2,000 rice shops in the city were operating as usual. Most replenished their stocks to meet retail demand. Sources have not yet increased significantly, and the market situation is tight.</p>
<p>The flour market was initially firm but then retreated, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Bran sales remained strong, with prices rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Oil cakes and miscellaneous grains declined successively. Soybean cake transactions were very sluggish, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red beans weakened further by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, corn decreased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and red sorghum continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sesame sales were sluggish, plummeting by 10,000 yuan, with few buyers. Raw peanuts sales were sluggish, falling by 20,000 yuan. The oil market was in a slump, continuing to fall. Soybean oil plummeted by 20,000 yuan, and raw oil fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan due to small recoveries in Qingdao. Sesame oil, clear oil, and rapeseed oil all saw sharp declines of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Request for Demolition of Japanese Cement Factories; Satisfactory Outcome; Awaiting Formulation of a Plan to Submit to the Reparations Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The National Cement Industry Association, in order to petition the government to negotiate the demolition of Japanese cement factories to be used as reparations to benefit reconstruction, dispatched representatives last Friday to Jinling to petition the Executive Yuan, the Political Yuan Reparations Committee, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Resources Committee.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xi Zhengxiu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Association who participated in the petition, speaking to reporters yesterday: The outcome of this trip was very satisfactory. The Association's petition was based on two points: (1) The Japanese cement industry had 38 factories before the war, with an annual output of 40 million barrels. Its own consumption was only half of this, and the rest was mainly sold to our country and the South Sea Islands. (2) If domestic order is restored, a large amount of cement will be needed during the construction period, and the current domestic production capacity cannot meet this demand.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the government was requested to do two things: (1) Negotiate with the Far Eastern Reparations Committee to include Japanese cement factories in the scope of reparations. (2) Order the representative stationed in Japan to promptly issue a statement to the Allied Headquarters stating that our country should retain the right to request the demolition and compensation of the remaining Japanese cement industry equipment.</p>
<p>As a result of the petition, the Political Yuan Reparations Committee has agreed to consult with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Resources Committee to formulate a plan. Then, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will instruct our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, to formally negotiate with the Far Eastern Reparations Committee.</p>
<h3>Allocation Plan for Coal Used by Factories in May Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The second meeting of the Civil Coal Allocation Committee was held at the Fuel Management Committee yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Representatives from the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the Garrison Headquarters, the Public Utilities Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Industrial Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Coal Industry, the Machine-made Coal Ball Industry, and the Inland River Shipping Industry attended. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Zhang Shanyang, Deputy Director of the Fuel Management Committee, and adjourned at around 6:00 PM after discussing more than ten cases. The allocation plan for 15,000 tons of coal for factory use in May was approved. Due to time constraints, the allocation for this month will still be distributed according to the original allocation plan of the Fuel Management Committee. The improved allocation plan will be discussed in a small group meeting to be held this Friday or Saturday, and once approved, it will be implemented next month.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Explains How to Identify 5,000 Yuan Counterfeit Bills</h3>
<p>Recently, counterfeit bills have flooded the market, and the types have been increasing from time to time. It has been reported that among the 2,000 yuan bills of the grass-green version issued by the Central Bank in 1947, many have been found to have been altered to 5,000 yuan bills with the same pattern and color. The identification of this type of counterfeit bill is very obvious: (1) The paper quality of genuine bills is better. (2) The middle of the "3" in the serial number on the front is slightly red. (3) The "5" character on counterfeit bills is fuzzy and not glossy. (4) Genuine bills were printed in 1945, while counterfeit bills were printed in 1947. (5) The bottom of genuine bills has the words "Central Printing Plant," while counterfeit bills have the words "Central Printing Plant Shanghai Plant." (6) The signatures of the Director and Deputy Director on the back of genuine bills are "Li Junbang" and "Yin Fu," while those on counterfeit bills are "Liang Ping" and "Chen Tingzuo." (7) The "2000" on the back of genuine bills is in round font, while that on counterfeit bills is in square font.</p>
<h3>Disposition of Raw Silk Material Pending Final Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] It is understood that the number of silk factories in the country is more than double the amount of raw materials, making allocation very difficult. The Silk Cocoon Production and Sales Guidance Committee has held two meetings to discuss the matter, but has not been able to make a final decision. It is reported that the revised measures are currently being consulted with the silk reeling guilds of the Third District. It is understood that the silk reeling guilds of the Third District held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, attended by Chu Fucheng, Leng Yuqiu, and others. Once definite opinions are obtained, they will be submitted by the Silk Guidance Association for a final decision.</p>
<p>[Another report] The third meeting of the Silk Cocoon Production and Sales Guidance Committee is scheduled to be held at the China Silk Company at No. 216 Laobaizi Road at 10:00 AM today. The main agenda items are to review the qualifications of silk factories applying for cocoon and silk loans and to approve the amount of cocoons to be purchased. The Shanghai Cigarette Factory Industry Association believes that the government's current foreign exchange allocation for tobacco leaves is still 8 million US dollars, a meager amount that is insufficient for the needs of the various cigarette factories in the city. In addition to petitioning the authorities for leniency, it also convened a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss how to allocate this 8 million US dollars of tobacco leaves among the 93 cigarette factory members. After deliberation, it was decided to form a small committee to handle the matter in a unified manner. Yao Shushen, Zhang Yuwen, and eight others were immediately elected as committee members, and it is planned to petition the authorities to allow the association to directly obtain foreign exchange on behalf of the cigarette factories in production. Before approval is obtained, all tobacco leaf raw materials purchased by import companies must be sold to officially producing cigarette factories and must not flow into the hands of non-industry persons to avoid hoarding and speculation and affecting the proper production of cigarettes.</p>
<h3>Calm Silk Market; Weak Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>The rayon market was extremely stable yesterday. No. 120 Kosan Yukari opened at 5.78 million yuan. Due to the state of demand exceeding supply, the asking price gradually increased, reaching 6.3 million yuan for a deal of one case, with the closing price being 6.2 million yuan. There were no transactions in the afternoon. The closing price was 16 million yuan, 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The silk market remained calm. Although monetary conditions were tight, asking prices did not easily fall, especially for A-grade silk, which was quite scarce on the market. Calculating the cost, it was beyond the 20 million mark, so the asking price yesterday was still 20 million yuan, with no transactions. C-grade silk was priced similarly to the previous day, but the payment terms were all five- to seven-day promissory notes. Dried silk, another name for inferior silk, was only asking for 13 million yuan, but there were no buyers.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics were uniformly weak. Quilt covers fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in asking price. Da Cheng checked crepe was priced at 26,500 yuan to 27,000 yuan, 2,600 yuan less than the previous day. The reason was that monetary conditions were quite tight, and all parties were willing to cut losses to sell, which led to this situation. Hang goods, such as Hang silk gauze, were reported to be lower in Hang City, and transactions in Shanghai City were very scarce, so yesterday's price fell by 1,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>Industry Peers Absorbing Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Due to tight monetary conditions for factories, familiar raw materials have become sluggish in the raw materials market. Unfamiliar raw materials have been imported at very high prices, so industry peers are absorbing them. According to industry insiders, raw material prices are rising daily. Even if imports can be cleared smoothly, they are still more than twice as low as the current Shanghai prices. For example, Vaseline is a popular item for summer sales. The current import price is 9.5 to 10 US cents per pound, and with shipping costs and interest converted, the cost has reached more than 5,000 yuan, so ordering from abroad is not as cost-effective as absorbing spot goods.</p>
<h3>Jute Bags Trend Upward</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] With more goods being shipped from Shanghai to other ports, and with the cocoon season approaching, the use of jute bags is increasing, and actual sales are becoming more frequent. Indian 2.5-pound green line bags have risen to 33,000 yuan per bag, 3-line No. 1 bags to 14,000 yuan, and white line No. 1 bags to 14,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Request for Flexible Measures for the Transportation and Transshipment of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Cotton Spinning Industry Association of the Sixth District held a general membership meeting of yarn mills with more than 4,000 spindles yesterday. After discussion, two important motions were passed: (1) Passed the motion to subscribe to 10 million US dollar price coupons. (2) Since the Executive Yuan promulgated three measures to suppress yarn and cloth prices, the transportation and transshipment of yarn and cloth between Shanghai and the interior has been completely paralyzed. It was resolved to request the association to send a letter to the Textile Management Committee, within ten days, to formulate alternative measures to ease the industry's difficulties.</p>
<p>Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves in Principle</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] According to the Textile Management Committee, the general principles of the yarn and cloth transshipment measures have been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Implementation rules must now be drafted based on these general principles, and they will be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Association Resolves Four Important Cases</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association recently held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, resolving four cases:</p>
<p>(1) The National Bank requires that all foreign exchange entrusted for sale must be settled by the 24th of this month. Many members of the fur industry have not been able to sell their goods due to the sluggish overseas market. They plan to request the National Bank to extend the deadline. Resolution: Jointly apply with the association to the National Bank and the relevant authorities to request the cancellation of the deadline. If necessary, send representatives to petition the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>(2) It is heard that the chain system still needs to be exchanged between the export and import authorities. It is hoped that the authorities will adopt it so that the current situation of the industry can be rapidly improved.</p>
<p>(3) Hold a preparatory meeting to generate representatives for the general membership meeting. The preparatory meeting will be held in six sessions, with representatives generated at the end of this month and the beginning of next month. The date of the representative general membership meeting will be decided at the next meeting of directors and supervisors. There will be approximately 340 representatives.</p>
<p>(4) Compile a membership directory to be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial World Third Issue Published</h3>
<p>The third issue of "Industrial and Commercial World," published by Pan Shihao and edited by Yuan Bairi, was published yesterday. In addition to the two major features written by experts, "The 10,000 Yuan Note" and "The Future of Rice," there are also several insider news stories. The price per copy is 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Applications for the Second Quarter's Quota Allocation Reach Over 15,000</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The reporter visited the Quota Allocation Office of the Import and Export Control Committee yesterday and asked many questions. The relevant person in charge of the office provided explanations, the main points of which are recorded as follows: (1) The quota allocation for the first quarter has been completed to 90%, and the quota allocation for the second quarter is currently underway. To date, a total of over 15,000 applications have been received, with a total application amount of 630 million US dollars. (2) In the past, the review of the qualifications of importers and the allocation of import quotas were generally based on statistical data from 1946. Since this method is more favorable to importers in Shanghai, all regions across the country have been asked to provide other reference materials (such as pre-war import quantities), which will be adjusted for fairness. (3) The reason why imported goods must be operated by importers: (a) Importers can also regulate and supply various imported goods needed by inland manufacturers. (b) Importers approved for registration are qualified to operate the import business according to the regulations. (4) Although the application for importer qualifications has been closed, the following two types of importers can still apply for registration and await approval: (a) Importers established before the war with business operations. (b) Exclusive agents of famous foreign manufacturers. (5) To avoid importers ordering imported raw materials that do not meet the needs of general manufacturers, the office has prepared a detailed list of the quotas for various imported goods and the quotas allocated to each approved importer and sent it to the Industrial Association for reference and overall consultation. Before issuing permits, the office also requires each importer to provide a contract for the sale of its imported goods to various manufacturers to prove it. Therefore, the difficulty of importing goods that do not meet actual needs can be easily resolved.</p>

<h3>A Complete Picture of Hefei</h3>
<p>— Urgent Dispatch from the 2nd. Our Hefei Reporter, Bai Ping</p>
<p>Today, Hefei, though the political center of Anhui Province, and with no confirmed date for the provincial capital to return to Anqing, is dilapidated and old. The progress since the initial victory two years ago has been very limited. The people living here are waiting for the construction of Hefei. However, at present, construction is out of the question. In principle, the provincial capital is still to be moved back to Anqing. The provincial government has some reservations about building up the current capital, Hefei. Let the reporter sketch a brief outline of Hefei and wish it rapid progress from now on.</p>
<p>Within Cultural Circles – An Utterly Desolate Scene</p>
<p>Let's first take a stroll through the cultural landscape. Hefei currently has four daily newspapers and one weekly newspaper. The "Wan Bao" and "Anhui Daily" are broadsheets, each publishing one sheet daily. The "Hefei Daily" and "Gongzheng Bao" are quarto-sized, each publishing one sheet daily. The "Xiaoyao Jin Weekly" is a quarto-sized publication of four pages per issue. None of these five newspapers are purely privately owned, but they all suffer from the same malnutrition. They are short on staff and short on money, relying solely on the hard work of "active duty" personnel. There are four news agencies: Jianxing, Chaoran, Minben, and Huazhong, which release news dispatches daily. Since the implementation of emergency economic measures, the pressure from high prices has intensified their struggle. There are over a dozen bookstores, large and small, with sluggish business and deserted entrances. These bookstores mainly sell books and periodicals published in Shanghai. In Hefei, prices are high, and making money is difficult. Most of those who love to read newspapers are poor scholars, while the wealthy lack the time and interest. There are many who browse in bookstores without buying, but very few actually open their wallets to purchase. There are also several establishments that specialize in renting and selling books, and their business seems slightly better than that of bookstores. Unfortunately, most of the rentals are illustrations from "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin." There is still no sign of fresh publications, which is a great disappointment for book and newspaper enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Speaking of the publishing industry, it's even more pitiful. "Anhui Politics," "Anhui Literature," "Anhui Health," and "New Learning Style" are all published by government agencies, each providing theoretical analysis and publicity for their respective areas of responsibility. These periodicals are almost always difficult to produce. Printing conditions limit them, and funding is also a major issue. In this situation, trying to find a publication purely for the sake of culture is like "wearing out straw sandals with no place to be found."</p>
<p>There are also organized music and drama groups here, but there are no professional workers. Instead, these are amateur activities by civil servants. Due to time and economic constraints, there has never been a public performance. For example, a month ago, the newspaper reported on the upcoming performance of "Sunrise," but to this day, it remains silent and unseen.</p>
<p>Construction – Willing Heart, Powerless Hands</p>
<p>It is said that when the provincial government moved to Hefei after the victory, there were plans to improve the streets of Hefei. I heard that the plan was quite ambitious. If implemented, many houses would have to be demolished, and the streets would be wide and flat, allowing Hefei to make more than a decade's worth of progress. However, more than a year has passed, and apart from a few streets where the original, chaotic rubble has been replaced with pebble-paved dirt roads, the rest remains uneven and bumpy, making walking difficult. This is naturally not because the construction authorities are unwilling to work hard. They understand the people's situation, but there are too many difficulties in implementing the plans. Liu Yiyan, the director of the Construction Department, once told reporters: "The government itself has no money. There are very few wealthy merchants in Hefei. Rebuilding the streets would bankrupt many people. If merchants voluntarily demolish their houses and improve the streets, I would absolutely welcome it, but I cannot order them to do so forcefully. Since the victory, the people have been deeply impoverished. We can only make do for now, especially since the provincial capital is not permanently located here." This is the main obstacle to building Hefei!</p>
<p>Money is needed in peacetime, money is needed in wartime, and money is also needed after victory. Since the victory, the construction of the nation has begun, and the first thing needed is construction funds. However, what is lacking today is precisely money. There are two major problems in Hefei that urgently need to be solved: the drinking water problem and the lighting problem. However, due to the money problem, these cannot be resolved. Hefei is long from east to west and short from north to south. The people who built the city in the past diverted the river outside the east gate (connected to Chaohu Lake) to the west of the city, perhaps to address the city's drinking water problem. However, over time, this river has been neglected, and today, the large culvert under the east gate city wall is completely silted up with mud. The river within the city is almost level with the land. As a result, the residents of the city have no choice but to drink the salty water from wells. People who come to Hefei for the first time invariably suffer from drinking salty water tea. Salty water is indeed not suitable for drinking. In the summer, a cup of tea turns black in no time. Moreover, there are many private wells, adjacent to open sewers. Almost, sewage and well water have become a cyclical process, which is really detrimental to hygiene. Furthermore, there is the lighting problem. Hefei still has no electric lights (the electric light factory that existed before the war was destroyed by the Japanese). Residents use kerosene lamps or even vegetable oil lamps, which is extremely inconvenient and harmful to people's eyesight. Government agencies are particularly inconvenienced. Last year, I heard that the river within the city was to be dredged, and an electric light factory was to be established. However, until now, "we only hear the sound of the stairs," and "no one is coming down."</p>
<p>Recently, the provincial government decided to establish a Hefei Municipal Preparatory Office, to be concurrently handled by the Department of Construction. I hope it will not be just an institutional name.</p>
<p>Underground Banks - Strutting Proudly</p>
<p>Hefei is the center of Anhui. The total land area of the county is 6,035 square kilometers, the cultivated land area is 3,157,731 mu, and the population is 1,274,384. These three figures are the highest among all counties in the province, but the economic value of Hefei is less than that of Wuhu and Bengbu, and therefore it is less prosperous than these two places. Currently, according to statistics from the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, there are only 54,000 people within the city of Hefei. The local population is small, and it is not a major transportation route, so commerce is suffocating in a state of depression.</p>
<p>In today's sluggish national economy, commerce in Hefei naturally appears desolate and bleak. However, one thing that differs from Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhu, and Bengbu is that seven or eight out of ten larger businesses are established through shareholding. There is, of course, nothing to say if they earn profits. Even if they lose money and cannot maintain operations, shareholders with strong capital can increase their shares, or the original shareholders can withdraw, and new shareholders can be added. The store still exists. Furthermore, inland commercial transactions generally follow the principle of selling at the cost of purchase, buying high and selling high. Losing money is a rare occurrence. Also, for example, if the price of a certain commodity in Shanghai rises, it naturally rises here as well. Sometimes, when the price in Shanghai falls, it does not immediately fall here. It must go through a period of time before it falls. As a result, very few stores here go bankrupt. When bankruptcies were most prevalent in Beijing and Shanghai, things here remained calm. Therefore, there are no major sales or auctions with marching bands to attract customers throughout the year. It is always so plain and unremarkable, maintaining the old city's market.</p>
<p>A businessman said that Hefei merchants are willing to borrow from underground banks rather than from banks because merchants see money as circulating capital. When borrowing, they calculate the interest. The interest rate for borrowing from banks is 1.2%, and collateral is required. The repayment period is also fixed at one month or several months. Moreover, finding a guarantor is troublesome. Underground banks are different. Lenders always know the details of the borrowers and have friendships. Collateral is not necessarily required. Although the interest rate for borrowing money is higher than that of banks (1.5%), if they borrow today, money will come in tomorrow, and they can repay part of it. There are also no office hour restrictions. This is more convenient than paying interest in advance to a bank, and the effect of turnover is the same. Therefore, underground banks are more active than banks. The reporter has been in contact with many civil servants. From conversations, I know that they all find their current positions difficult to endure. As a result, they believe that everyone is the same. Changing careers would be the same thing. They can only muddle along day by day. One civil servant said: "I am not an expert in my current profession, and changing professions would make me an outsider. People in every profession complain. If I leave this profession, I will still miss it." Life is stressful, and civil servants endure the mechanical routine of going to work and getting off work in this conflicting mood.</p>
<p>We hope the government will pay attention to the lives of civil servants. Constantly letting them sigh and endure days is detrimental to administrative efficiency.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>— Air dispatch from Chiayi, 4th day. Di Dong</p>
<p>Hakka People - Living Comfortably</p>
<p>The locals here, apart from a very small number of indigenous people - the Gaoshan tribes - are mostly compatriots from the Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The total population of the province is said to be 6.5 million, with the Gaoshan tribes accounting for about 300,000 to 400,000, the Hakka people for over a million, and the rest being Minnan people from Fujian. The Gaoshan tribes still live in the deep mountains and rarely interact with people in the plains. Their lives are still semi-primitive. They speak native dialects and Japanese and have fierce temperaments. It is said that the Hakka people, because they came to Taiwan relatively late, also live in more remote mountain villages. However, they are rich in diligence and endurance and can fight against nature with their natural abilities. As the saying goes, "Outstanding people and a blessed land," they have also achieved great things through their unyielding, brave efforts. Many barren mountains have been reclaimed, and many wildernesses have been turned into rice paddies. They have created another situation and a base for life. Look! Aren't the Hakka people in that village all living happy and comfortable rural lives? Most of the compatriots from Fujian Province live in cities and rely on handicrafts for a living. After the restoration, because various factories, large and small, were severely damaged during the war, and the government was limited in manpower, resources, and raw materials, it was unable to resume work for a while. In the past, they generally felt the pain of unemployment for a short time.</p>
<p>Spring All Year Round - Pleasant Climate</p>
<p>The climate in Taiwan is generally similar to that of the Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The climate is hotter south of Chiayi, but because it is surrounded by the sea, the temperature changes drastically. The weather changes between cool and hot in a single day. However, it can be said that Taiwan has spring all year round. Apart from June, July, and December, which have very short periods that seem to have some distinction between winter and summer, most of the days are warm and pleasant. Even in winter and summer, there is no need for light furs to keep out the cold, or it will be too hot to bear. Because there is spring all year round, fruits are produced in all four seasons. The author believes that what is especially worth reporting is the watermelon. Here, it is not only a good product for cooling off in the summer, but it can also be enjoyed in the winter. As for bananas and oranges, it goes without saying that they are available all year round.</p>

<p>Taiwan Provincial Newspaper Employees Call</p>
<p>Since the unfortunate February 28th Incident occurred in Taiwan Province, in addition to a few newspapers being sealed by the authorities, the remaining newspapers that have been approved for registration by the Ministry of Interior, such as "Industrial and Commercial News," "Economic Daily," "National Affairs Daily," and "Ziqiang Daily," have also been temporarily suspended due to martial law. Now, it is learned that since the suspension of these newspapers, the authorities have not formally notified them of the news of resumption of publication, resulting in employees' lives being extremely difficult. It is hoped that Chairman Wei will take appropriate measures to quickly address the unresumed newspapers after taking office in order to maintain the lives of the newspaper employees.

<h3>A Record of Green Mountain Students Performing and Sightseeing</h3>
<p>— Li Dongfang</p>
<p>The six states of New England are the oldest among the forty-eight states of the United States and also hold a leading position in culture. Every year, all secondary schools hold an annual drama competition, which greatly contributes to promoting the study of drama and improving the interests of residents.</p>
<p>This year, the preliminary competition for the schools of Green Mountain State happened to coincide with the spring break of Green Mountain University.</p>
<p>If it hadn't been for the encouragement and enthusiastic help of the veteran drama practitioner and friend of Chinatown, Mr. Carl Glick, I would not have received such a good opportunity. Although Mr. Glick is not a native of Green Mountain State, he has an indissoluble bond with it. Thirty or forty years ago, he promoted the Community Theater Movement everywhere, and his footprints can be found in states across the east, west, north, and south. However, he believes that Green Mountain State is the most beautiful, and the "Green Mountain State Teachers Union" also knows that Mr. Glick loves their hometown the most, so every year they invite Mr. Glick to serve as a judge for the drama preliminary competition. This is somewhat related to my stay in Green Mountain (I am ashamed!), so I had to accompany him around the state out of a sense of duty.</p>
<p>The two of us traveled together, covering the entire state.</p>
<p>We went as far north as St. Albans, as far south as Arlington, and as far east as St. Johnsbury. And to Middlebury. We traveled along the lake and through the mountains.</p>
<p>In every place, there must be a secondary school principal to provide gentlemanly hospitality in the New England manner. The two of us would politely decline, return to the hotel to enjoy the local cuisine, then take a nap, drink wine, and stride into the auditorium of the secondary school in a grand manner for dinner.</p>
<p>In each auditorium, there were an average of three, four, or even five one-act plays to watch. The actors were all secondary school students, innocent and carefree, very happy to have the opportunity to express themselves. Ninety percent of the audience were also secondary school students, appreciating the achievements of their classmates on stage. Whether the actors made a mistake or made a correct gesture, the classmates in the audience would applaud. Whether a sentence was spoken incorrectly or correctly, there would also be applause. Especially when a kissing scene occurred, in addition to applause, there would also be wild boar-like roars. Even in the United States, secondary school students still have a sense of rarity and preciousness about kissing.</p>
<p>Out of the thirty plays, Mr. Glick selected six to participate in the New England finals. I would like to introduce the three that I preferred among these six: (1) "Who Says Can't?" (2) "Good Night, Please!" (3) "The Hungerers."</p>
<p>"Who Says Can't?" was written by female writer Ratharyn. Mc Clure and performed by students of Rellows Free Academy in St. Albans. The plot is very simple but caters to the tastes of secondary school students. At the beginning, a brother and sister are sharing breakfast with their mother, fighting over cake. The mother seems to favor the boy, often telling the daughter to go to the kitchen to get things, walking in and out, without telling the son to do it. Moreover, the older brother likes to bully his younger sister, mocking her for not knowing how to dress up and for not having been kissed by a man even at the age of sixteen. — I think this is probably an exaggeration by the writer. American women who have not been kissed by the age of sixteen are probably not a minority. — The younger sister is extremely angry and seeks advice from her female classmates. The female classmates teach her many seductive postures. She learns them very clumsily. A man comes, who is the older brother's classmate, but he doesn't understand her painstaking hints at all, which is really worrying. Who knows, the older brother happens to come home and suspects that there are questionable signs, sternly scolding his classmate for not flirting with his younger sister and not kissing his younger sister without his permission. The classmate is angered by him and kisses her for real, "Who Says Can't?" — The younger sister wins. The older brother has no choice.</p>
<p>"Good Night, Please!" was written by James Daggett and performed by Waterbury High School. When the curtain rises, a middle-aged man is lying in bed, snoring loudly. His daughter, wife, and brother-in-law come to visit one after another, trying to wake him up. He drives them away and continues to snore. This is an afternoon, not an evening. He has been sleeping for three days and is not sick. He is the manager of a bank and has many official matters waiting for him to handle. If he continues to snore like this, who knows how much it will affect the confidence of depositors. So, the daughter, wife, and brother-in-law want to use every method to prevent him from sleeping anymore. He protests loudly, saying, "I have worked hard for twenty years without stopping for a moment. Don't I have the right to rest for a week and sleep to my heart's content?" The highlight of this play is the actors' "pantomime."</p>
<p>"The Hungerers" was written by William Saroyan, the author of "The Human Comedy," and performed by Rutland High School. It describes a writer, with a tattered shirt, buried in his work on a typewriter. He imagines the protagonists in his mind visiting him one by one, causing him trouble. The first one to come in is a Young Capitalist and a salesman for the "Saturday Evening Post," asking him to subscribe to a copy of the "Saturday Evening Post." The writer says, "I have no money." The salesman says, "Why doesn't anyone in the world want to subscribe to the "Saturday Evening Post?" The writer says, "Are you hungry?" The salesman says, "I'm afraid I'm a little hungry. The day before yesterday morning, I remember I seemed to have had breakfast once." Then, a woman comes in. The salesman and she talk. The writer asks them both to leave, but this young woman is also a hungry person and refuses to leave. The writer asks her if she really needs bread or if she needs love. She says, "I don't know." The writer says, "You obviously need love more." The woman asks him very directly: "Do you love me?" He says, "No." The young woman cries loudly. He quickly says, "I can love you, I...really love you." The young woman says, "I can't believe it." But she certainly feels much better. The writer says, "If I still had five cents on me, I could take the manuscript to the publisher and sell it." — He sympathizes with this salesman and this hungry young woman and resolutely tells the salesman to take the typewriter out and sell it for five dollars, four dollars...one dollar, it can't be less than one dollar, hoping everyone will have a good meal. After the salesman takes away the typewriter, he tells the young woman about an experience from his childhood.</p>
<p>He says: "When I was very young, I liked grapes, but I had never eaten them. One day, I saw that the grapes on the shelves of a family looked very good. I looked at them for a long time, thinking about their taste. But the owner came out and thought I was stealing grapes and wanted to catch me, so I ran away..." The young woman asks, "What happened later?" The writer says, "The story is over." The young woman says, "How tragic!" and bursts into tears.</p>
<p>The salesman comes back, and the typewriter has not been sold. The three of them, plus an old woman who walks in later, all starve to death. Before starving to death, they say many philosophical things...However, it turns out to be a spring dream, an illusion.</p>
<p>The students of Rutland High School are full of energy and are able to perform this play, which is not easy. I think they have a good chance of winning an award in the finals.</p>
<p>Among the other twenty-odd failed student drama groups, many fail because they like to play old women too much. Female students are fond of imitation, and there is a tendency to play old women in both China and the United States. To be honest, I don't understand their motives.</p>
<p>The choice of script and the director's skills are, of course, factors in victory and defeat. Some schools fail not because of the students but because of the director. I suggested to Mr. Glick that the schools perform the same script so that the selection would be fairer. He said, "There are also problems. Because the judges get tired after seeing the third school, and the scores become more and more harsh."</p>
<h3>Prayer</h3>
<p>— By Karel Capek of Czechia, translated by Gao Lang</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, Creator of the beautiful land, look upon our suffering and despair; to You, we need not describe the misfortunes we have suffered or how we have bowed our heads. We do not bow our heads in shame, nor is there reason for shame, though fate strikes us like iron. Yet we have not been crushed; nor have we failed to show our courage, and our nation will not lose its glory; it has only lost a part of its body. We are like a man bound to the teeth of a wheel, who first tastes the most cruel suffering, and yet he still lives. Our nation lives in extreme suffering, yet it feels that life is still so powerfully alive.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, Creator of our nation, to You, we need not recount our calamities in detail. Yet, for our one and only demand, we strive to the end, and our mouths and hearts will never let it be lost, and that is faithfulness. Faithfulness is in our hearts, in our history. We will never betray the faithfulness in our history. We, who strive for faithfulness, have a more beautiful and hopeful future and growth, and more flowering and beautiful fruits; what is temporary violence?</p>
<p>Greater than violence is truth, for truth is everlasting, and even in times of hardship, we must solemnly swear never to be lazy. Now we must work even harder for our country, for its inner strength and unity. Only excellent people can save a nation, and we will work for the positive side of history. In our fate, a world-class drama will be performed with great and glorious effort.</p>
<p>We are not at all afraid of the trends of world events; on the contrary, no combination of barbarian forces can compare to the freedom, peace, and equality demanded by nations, countries, and peoples. We must work patiently; we must love our country even more than in the past; and we must have great love for each other. We believe that the most important thing is to take on the mission on earth; in the present of the dark period indicated by European history, we will build our country into a promising future as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord, we do not pray for revenge. Yet we wish you to encourage us with the spirit of faithfulness and hope; may you not censure our failures and disappointments. Just let each of us explore how to serve the eternal destiny of our country in the future, and we do not need anyone to be disappointed. We need faithfulness. We need inner strength, and we need love that effectively increases our strength tenfold.</p>
<p>One cannot call a country small, because its great faithfulness is enough to build a long-term future.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 508</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>She first giggled, then vigorously shook her head like Bolang's, making her two small braids bounce back and forth, switching places from left to right. The one in front moved to the back, and the one in the back jumped to the front, before casually saying, as if nothing was amiss:</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter."</p>
<p>What was that supposed to mean? When people ask your name, it's a common courtesy, a way to start a conversation and address you properly. Reciprocity is essential, a fundamental aspect of social interaction, so how can she say "doesn't matter"? What exactly does "doesn't matter" imply? Does it mean she's not here to talk to Tsurumi, and whether or not she reveals her name is irrelevant? Or does it mean her name is unnecessary, regardless of whether people ask?</p>
<p>Upon hearing these peculiar words, Tsurumi was momentarily puzzled, unsure of her intentions. He could only assume the young woman was somewhat naive. However, her lively eyes suggested intelligence, and despite her youth, such ignorance seemed unlikely. Therefore, having asked her name and who her brother was, why such a "special" response?</p>
<p>"Oh..."! Tsurumi was increasingly perplexed.</p>
<p>"No," she said, seeing Tsurumi staring blankly, probably realizing she had embarrassed him. She added an explanation to her "doesn't matter" statement: "I originally wanted to talk to my brother, and it also concerns you, sir. Since my brother isn't here, it doesn't matter if we talk." With another giggle, how was Tsurumi supposed to respond? If Tsurumi said, "If what you wanted to discuss with your brother also concerns me, perhaps you could enlighten me directly," who knows what kind of "concern" she meant? Was it to tell her brother not to involve Tsurumi in this dispute? Or did she want to understand Tsurumi's own situation? The scope of this "concern" was vast and limitless. Was it appropriate to ask her directly? Even if Tsurumi disregarded these hesitations and asked her to elaborate, he had to be wary of another casual, "doesn't matter"! At that point, Tsurumi would likely be at a complete loss.</p>
<p>However, saying, "I don't know who your brother is, and I can't say for sure if he'll come or not... In other words, since you think it doesn't matter if we talk, please leave," was also impossible. First, her brother might actually be Shouyi, Li Ming, or that Korean comrade, one of those three. Such discourtesy would surely offend them. Second, after saying "doesn't matter if we talk," the woman stood motionless, not showing any intention of leaving. Tsurumi was truly at a loss.</p>
<h3>The Lamp</h3>
<p>— Si Min</p>
<p>A lamp, it is a beautiful soul!</p>
<p>When the sun drags its heavy steps down the hillside; when night builds black walls around the fields, the lamp, like blossoming flowers, blooms all over the city or the entire city. If you want to say that the lamp is like a star on the earth! Then, your imagination is more beautiful</p>
<p>Seeing the lamp, we think of light and tomorrow.</p>
<p>The lamp is the eye of wisdom. Because of her instructions, you will jump out of the maze of life and recognize your own path. And you will not stumble.</p>
<p>In the revelation of the lamp, people go in different directions to hunt for their hopes and happiness!</p>
<p>Don't despise her, and don't dislike her being too small. No matter how dirty the corner is, she can shine it. Where she goes, life will be stubborn, and the despicable and sordid will be completely exposed.</p>
<p>Tell me, what ecstasy would a wandering ship, lost in the night-shrouded strange sea, feel when it saw the light?</p>
<p>Assuming there is such a lamp, I thought so. She is infinitely large, I hold her, in this long night that is difficult to dawn, I run around frantically; summoning the victims with an excited voice....</p>

<h3>Sounds of May</h3>
<p>— Sheng He</p>
<p>——Thoughts after the Second Symphony Concert</p>
<p>The Municipal Symphony Orchestra held its second concert at Xin at 5:15 pm this month, embellishing this beautiful May - the season of music, bringing a lot of sublime spiritual pleasure to music lovers.</p>
<p>I went to listen, and now I will briefly and ramblingly describe my feelings as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Although there were only five major programs scheduled this time, they represented the works of composers from Germany, England, Austria, France, and the Soviet Union, each with its own characteristics. The Municipal Symphony Orchestra truly lived up to its name by introducing world-famous music.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of general performance results, this performance was not only more advanced than the last one, but also quite successful. Professor Fu Hua seemed a little "stage-frightened" during the last performance because he hadn't conducted for a long time, but this time he was more than competent. In particular, when conducting Haydn's Symphony No. 4 in D major (the very famous "Clock Symphony"), he was powerful and expressive, and the meaning of this symphony, which is quite close to "program music," was fully expressed.</p>
<p>(3) In the program of Saint-Saëns' "Cello Concerto," the pure skill and understanding of the music by the cello soloist Shevtzoff sublimated the style and fantasy of this modern French romantic composer, highlighting it vividly. I have heard Shevtzoff's cello solo several times, but this performance achieved unexpectedly satisfactory results.</p>
<p>(4) In fact, the eight Soviet folk songs have a stronger song flavor than folk songs. In terms of the music itself, they are far less rich in folk song atmosphere than Soviet folk songs such as "Vanka" and "Volga Boatmen's Song." The characteristic of these eight folk songs is that they still maintain the consistent style of Soviet music in terms of melody and rhythm. (The most obvious is that many songs use minor keys.)</p>
<p>Based on the situation of the two performances, I would like to offer two suggestions to the Municipal Symphony Orchestra:</p>
<p>(1) The number of concerned seats is too small, only accommodating more than 500 people, so there are many listeners who are unable to attend and withdraw. In order to facilitate the public to have the opportunity to appreciate good music, the group should immediately find another performance venue. Fortunately, it is now the beginning of summer and the weather is getting warmer, so it seems possible to resume the past open-air performances in Yiyuan.</p>
<p>(2) In order to promote Chinese music, it is best to arrange some Chinese music programs for each performance, such as Huang Zi, Zhao Yuanren, Ma Sicong, and other outstanding Chinese composers. They have many orchestral works or new creations in instrumental music, which should be introduced to music listeners as much as possible, so as to arouse the general public's awareness of Chinese music works and seek the progress of Chinese music.</p>
<p>Before being executed by firing squad, Tani Hisao, the main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, wrote in his will to his wife in court: "On ×× day of × month of Showa ×× year, I was executed in Yuhuatai, Nanjing. I will be forever separated from you. My body will be buried in a foreign land, and my soul will return to your side." If you didn't know who wrote this letter and what crime he committed, after reading these sad and mournful words, I'm afraid everyone would give sympathy and pity.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, many undelivered family letters and diaries were often found on the corpses of fallen Japanese soldiers. Inside, the longing and emotions for their hometown, parents, and wives were beautiful, gorgeous, and moving. If the evidence wasn't certain, who could believe that people with such rich emotions were the ones who committed rape and murder without doing evil.</p>
<p>So it makes us think of a question: How can people full of animal desires and animality have normal humanity?</p>
<p>My explanation is: Japanese militarism trained the Japanese nation to become descendants who believed in authority; they had no reason, no feelings, only violence, only blood; but when they were relatively sober, they inevitably revealed the feelings of human nature; so they were anti-war, tired of war, afraid of death, homesick, and sentimental, showing the contradictions of their dual military personality everywhere.</p>
<h3>Past and Future</h3>

<p>Man A: I saw a palm reader, and he predicted that I would have a serious illness.</p>
<p>Man B: But haven't you already had a serious illness six months ago?</p>
<p>Man A: I told him that too. But he said, "You haven't washed your hands in six months, what can I do?"</p>
<h3>"White-Collar Workers"</h3>
<p>— A Lin</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it may make those who have the theory of bedbugs in the United States happy. Just as we have the problem of price wages, the United States also has the problem of prices and wages. It is only that prices in the United States have only risen by 53% during and after the war, while our prices have risen by at least 10,000 to 20,000 times. Therefore, in the United States, wage disputes between workers and employers continue to occur, and the government recognizes that this is the right of the workers. However, it is said that "white-collar workers" do not have such good fortune. Because they have no organization, they cannot act as a group.</p>
<p>This example can arouse our sympathy across the Pacific Ocean, because for the sake of being gentlemen, for the sake of this little status, we can only live in the office, not dare to hum to the employer, because if you "act rashly," you will be dismissed, suspended, and hire someone else. When wages are owed, workers can protest. When wages are far less than prices, workers can demand increases. However, only you white-collar workers can shout and listen to the employer's instructions.</p>
<p>Today, many office gentlemen are paid half as much as their tea room workers. This is a great irony to intellectuals. Originally, "white-collar workers" cannot have any professional unions. Even if they meet, they can only ask each other how the weather is today.</p>
<p>The suffering of "white-collar workers" is the same at home and abroad. This is also a miracle of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"Orphans of the Storm"</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>"Orphans of the Storm" is a film made in wartime in England. The story simply depicts a young couple with a mediocre and rigid life. The husband is an accounting manager in a large company. Later, he was drafted into the army and joined the Royal Navy. Then, his wife also joined the Women's Royal Naval Service. Military life put the two people on another new life. They became younger, lively, and brave. Three years later, the two people met again on a vacation. Before meeting, they both had the idea of ​​divorce. When they met each other, they were surprised by the unexpected changes in each other. The idea of ​​divorce became a thing of the past, and they reconciled.</p>
<p>Obviously, such a story was made to encourage soldiers fighting in the war. It depicts the rigid life of the British in a comedic tone. On the other hand, it emphasizes how lively and brave the lives of those soldiers defending their country are. They embarked on a new life in the anti-fascist war. This new life not only defended democracy and the country, but also consolidated the happiness of the family and the security of love. This obvious contrast is powerful and correct. Because only by eliminating the brutal fascist bandits can we guarantee freedom and happiness in the democratic world. The author is smart and appropriate, and arranged these small stories with a high degree of humor. Although some places are inevitably exaggerated and the love changes between men and women in the war are written so casually, as a comedy theme to deal with, these are harmless to the theme.</p>
<p>The couple Robert and Cathy, played by Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr respectively, are particularly rare. Robert Donat's characterization of the husband's personality and appearance before joining the Navy is more vivid than the later plays. The quarrels with his wife on the street and the ridiculous scenes in the hotel during the holidays are also quite successful. And Deborah Kerr, who plays the wife, is still a new star on the screen, but her refined and profound acting skills have given the character of Cathy a rich life, and there is a kind of shining brilliance hidden in her simple and unpretentious acting skills. This is indeed a commendable success. In addition, Glynis Johns' Daisy and Anturde's Ana are also not weak.</p>
<p>In addition to the rich and excellent acting skills brought by these actors, we cannot but mention the achievements of director and producer Alexander Korda. He handled this play delicately and appropriately, especially from the continuous development of the play and the coordination of the external modeling of the couple. We saw the director's ingenuity, and the grasp of atmosphere and rhythm, and the handling of characters and scenes all showed the director's excellent talent</p>
<p>This is a rare good film recently and is worth recommending to readers.</p>
<h3>On Fraud</h3>
<p>— Xu Shougu</p>
<p>Obtaining property by fraud, and committing illegal acts through fraud, are all crimes. But what I'm talking about is fraud that is not prohibited by law. Does this make you incomprehensible? Please let me finish. There are three types of fraud that I call not prohibited:</p>
<p>(1) When judges interrogate cases, they often use deceptive and intimidating words to make the accused confess their crimes themselves, so as to facilitate the judgment. This is called fraud, and sometimes it is necessary, so it is not prohibited by law.</p>
<p>(2) Detectives handle cases with extremely secretive and unpredictable methods. Law enforcement agencies use them to catch thieves and do not punish them for fraud. It is clear that the law does not prohibit them.</p>
<p>(3) In times of war, offense and defense, advance and retreat, are of utmost importance. If enemy spies find out, it is difficult to avoid being deceived. Therefore, there is a saying that war is not averse to deception. This word fraud is also not prohibited by law.</p>

<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Company Commander Liu was also very considerate of the hardships of his subordinates.</p>
<p>"Let her go somewhere else..." He hoped to take care of both sides.</p>
<p>However, the fat woman in the car couldn't bear it anymore.</p>
<p>"Why do you want me to get off the car? I also bought a ticket!" she said angrily, her face flushed.</p>
<p>"If you have a ticket, go to the back!" Director Xiong, who had been sitting in the office for a long time and didn't go out often, was certainly not very clear about these situations. "This is the driver's seat. You female passengers are not allowed to sit here!"</p>
<p>"Bullshit!" The fat woman simply didn't pay attention to his splendid military uniform. "Isn't the one you brought also a woman? I won't let you! I won't let anyone!"</p>
<p>Director Neng was furious.</p>
<p>"Driver, drag her down!"</p>
<p>However, the driver couldn't do anything! He took too much money from others.</p>
<p>"Get down first! I'll think of another way for you!" Company Commander Liu, who was related to him, saw that the situation was very embarrassing, so he took a step forward and said to the fat woman whose face was as red as a large pig liver in a not very loud voice, hoping to coax her off the car and then deal with it.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this woman was also particularly stubborn.</p>
<p>"No, I won't get off!" She refused resolutely, speaking with a full mouth of Hunan dialect; her eyes were wide open, like a fierce beast defending its position, staring at the group of eight or so middle-aged people called Director Hou. He was very calm, and he was obviously confident in his heart. He turned around, put his hands behind his back, and looked leisurely at other places; but his young wife couldn't hold back and glared back at the fat woman on the driver's seat, her face full of displeasure.</p>
<p>Director Tai, who had achieved success at a young age, thought this was too much and glared his eyes, preparing to give Company Commander Liu, who was in charge of the motorcade, a hard time on the spot. (70)</p>
