<p>瑞格與柯林斯被拘之後就帶到哈爾濱拘禁，一切待遇還不差，每天供給西餐二次。兩天之後，他們可以到戶外去運動。拘留期內，最苦的是與外界消息完全隔絕，和沒有洗澡剃頭的機會；到了三月二十二日，中共當局通知他們可以釋放了，當天就由中共人員率領出發南下，中途宿兩夜，第三天早上由武裝衛兵騎着馬或徒步押送。</p>
<p>美使館歡迎人員在松花江畔等候</p>
<p>瑞格和柯林斯兩人則都乘着馬行，到了紅房子，下馬步行，直到松花江畔，遇見美方迎領人員，惟美大使館陸軍參贊蘇爾，空軍參贊卒納和新一軍軍長孫立人副官金上尉等人，則　上南岸高處，用望遠鏡觀看對岸中共區一幕戲劇。看見移交的人交代淸楚，他們就放一隻船開近北岸，迎接瑞格和柯林斯兩人平安渡河歸來。其時周圍五百碼內十分寗靜，惟江中水鴨數千，順流而下，空中飛鳥迎風飛翔而已。他們到了南岸，不見中國記者在塲，很是失望。蘇爾一行今夜住宿長春，受孫軍長招待，明晨乘C－47型機飛往南京。柯林斯的太太大腹便便，正在南京等候，她第一胎將要在五月三日生產了。</p>
<p>被禁押兩美軍官　未參與軍事活動</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿五日電〕國務院發言人宣布，最近一度被中共所俘之美軍官瑞格與柯林斯兩人，並未參加軍事活動，僅以觀察員資格，觀察國軍作戰。消息靈通人士並指出，謠傳「兩軍官曾簽署聲明，承認刺探中共軍陣地」之說，完全無稽</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處南京廿五日電〕美大使館廿五日晨宣布：司徒雷登大使原擬正式訪問漢口，茲因述日氣候欠佳，此行作爲罷論。渠擬於五月中旬以後，再定訪漢之期。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關係方面息：政院下週例會中，可望通過台灣省政府各廳主管人選，魏道明將於下月初赴台履新。當局以台省甫經變故，人心未安，故對各負責人員之選擇，極爲愼重，連日與赴台視察之白部長縝密硏究，尤以新任省主席為文　，故對警備司令一職，更為注意，迄今尚未作最後之決定。陳儀決於辦完移交後離台，已有電致新主席促駕。關於陳氏今後之出處，傅說粉紜，據胡資格人士表示，以重慶行轅主任一職可能性最大，但亦須於陳氏抵京後始能決定。</p>

<h3>社論　莫斯科會議閉幕之後</h3>
<p>舉世矚目的莫斯科四國外和會議，於廿四日舉行最後一次會議之後的，即正式宣告閉幕，英美法三國代表團也匆匆啟程離蘇返國，各奔前程了。從三月十日開幕起，到前天暑幕為止，恰七正是四十五天；在這一個半月之中，四國的代表團均已盡了最大的努力，終想使這次會議能領導世界走上和平的坦途；但是接連辯論了四十五天，結果可以說是一無所得，從最後一次會議所通過的四項決議，就可以看出來了。這四項決議是：（一）設立四強委員會，於五月十二日在維也納舉行第一次會議，討論四強對於對奧和約意見不同之點。（二）下次四國外長會議定於本年十一月間在倫敦舉行，賡續討論使英美與蘇聯意見粉歧的主要德國經濟統一等問題。（三）在聯合國大會閉幕之後，得於九月間在紐約召開臨時的四國外長會議：（四）柏林盟國管制委員會應於六月一日以前，擬就限制德國境內各國佔頒軍之計劃，俾於九月一日實施。</p>
<p>從此看來，可知這次外長會議，不僅未能擬就對德和約的草案，而且對奧和約也未能在莫斯科簽字；不論從那一個角度去觀察，這次外長會議可以說是全盤失敗了。在莫斯科會議開幕之前，世人固然從未抱過大的奢望，但終以爲對奧和約的在莫斯科簽字是沒有問題的，可是現在事實證明，對奧和約還要留待五月十二日在維也納舉行的四强委員會去討論；而且我們知道對奧和約的不能簽字，唯一的原因乃在奧國境內的德國資產問題，純粹是經濟的因素，可謂與政治無關，英美與蘇聯的爭執不下，完全由於雙方把自身的利害看得太重所致。所以德國問題的未能解決，原在世人意料之中，不足為奇；但是對奧和約的遭遇障礙，以致不能在莫斯科簽字，是誰也料不到的，不免要世人感覺到和平離開人間世界更加遙遠了。心理上的影響，對於世界政局的發展，格外覺得嚴重。</p>
<p>不可否認的，這次莫斯科外長會議全盤失敗了。我們所依據的消息，盡是通訊社及報紙所報導的，固然不能視爲完全可靠，美國政界及外交界人士，對於這次外長會議是否一無收穫，認爲項待馬歇爾國務卿返國報吿之後，始能加以判斷；但是我們檢討一下四强對於莫斯科會議所懷有的期望，就可以知道四國代表團徒費唇舌，並沒有達到他們所企求的願望。先以美國而論，馬帥赴莫斯科的目的，乃在促成四强公約及對奧和約的成立，但是現在並沒達到他的目的；就是在馬帥本人，對於莫斯科會議的成就，也已表示「深刻失望」了。其次是英國，外長會議旣未能使德國經濟獲得一合理的安排，當不能减輕英國納稅人的負担；而且英蘇兩國所進行的修約談判，也沒有重大的發展，在英國外相貝文心中，不能不感覺到苦悶。以言法國，她企望於莫斯科會議的，不僅多而且大，一方面要求薩爾區在經濟上併入法國的系統；另一方面還要使德國陷於四分五裂的境地，永遠不能翻身，不再威脅法國的安全。可是會議並沒有滿足法國外長比杜爾的願望。此在蘇聯，她要求德國賠償一百萬萬美元，並要奧國對於這次大戰負相當的責任，也能從奧國取得若干補償；但是會議的結果，蘇聯並未能在德國的西部，從現行生產中提取賠款。</p>
<p>其實外長會議的一事無成，豈僅使四國失望呢！就是在其餘世界各國，對於外長會議的失敗，也莫不威覺到「茫茫然如有所失」的心情。自第二次大戰結束以來，以歐洲言，已近兩年了；就遠東言，也已一年有半了。但是兩年來，眞正的和平，尙未降臨世間。有時還覺得和平之神，若隱若現，只是可望而不可接而已，心中終還抱着若干希望，眼前還有一綫光明：但是在這次外長會議之後，覺得和平離開世界更加遙遠了。德日是第二次大戰的罪魁禍首，收拾戰後的殘局，首應締結對德對日的和約；但是事到如今，於今年年內締結對德和約，已是沒有希望的了；我們假定下次四國外長會議圓滿結束，能替對德和約擬就一個爲大家所能同意的草案，但是在對德和會在年內終是無法召開的了；對德和約旣然難產，締結對日和約更加遙遙無期，至少在目前是談不到的。這一層是使我們最感失望的。</p>
<p>法國社會黨領袖勃魯姆在人民報發表一文，他說這次會議的最大成就，乃在英美法三國對於煤的問題，締結了一個協定。以法國的立塲而論，因爲法國迫切需要煤斤的供應，固不能認爲毫無理由，但是爲整個世界和平的利益計，這個協定在會外成立，實在是弊多利少的。據法國新聞社的消息，謂英美可能立即實施其統一德國西部的計劃，法國因為薩爾問題未能獲得結果，面已與英美成立煤斤協定，也有參加德國西部統一的可能。這個消息如果是事實的話，則今日的世界將有分裂而爲東西兩個世界的趨勢，更加明顯了。</p>
<p>要之，這次莫斯科外長會議，不僅未能領導世界走上和平的坦途；而且暗示世人，和平離開世界更加遙遠了。列强的政治外交家如果在散會之後不能反躬自省，大徹大悟，急起直追，運用其政治的智慧，從大處下手，先消滅國際間的猜忌疑懼，然後樹立互信互忍的精神，從而打下的僵局；則世界的前途，將爲疑雲慘霧所，永遠透露不出和平的陽光。</p>

<h3>莫斯科外長會議失敗後　法將與英美更接近　德國東西部分裂將益顯著</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫放廿五日電〕政界人士預料莫斯科會議失敗後，德國東西部之分裂狀態當益趨堅强。外長會議開會六星期之結果，主要問題均未能成立協議，如：（一）德國之經濟統一；（二）賠償之形式及範圍；（三）德國未來政體；（四）較小盟國參與德國和約討論之方式；（五）四强防德公約之訂立；（六）對奧條約之完成等主要問題，幾均一無成就。此外英蘇修改盟約之談判，亦無　體結　獲得。英美法之煤斤協定，堪爲六星期會議中之唯一重要成就，然此一協定，將使法國加張對西方佔領國之關係，形成東西兩部更明顯的分裂。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿四日電〕此間外交界人士頃談稱：英美兩國可能實施其統一德國西部以佛朗克福城爲首府之一項計劃，殆無疑義。此僅爲時間問題，或在此際即實行，抑或俟至聯合國大會閉幕之後實行，則尙未可知。此次莫斯科外長會議對於薩爾區間題，一無結果，而英美法三國對於煤斤問題則已成立協定，足使法國同意亦將參加德西部之統一。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿五日電〕本屆四國外長會議歷時最久，今日已於戰後盟國間最惡劣之僵持狀態中宣吿閉幕。西方各國大多數外交家認爲莫斯科會議甚至較一九四五年九月倫敦會議尤欠收穫，當時各外長開始談判對德附庸國和約固曾糾纏不已。莫斯科會議所討論諸問題，如四國解除德國軍備公約與對奧和約等，以視對德附庸國和約遠爲重要，而東西雙方之裂痕亦更深。少數人士預料此次進展必多，對奧和約問題較小，當可獲致協議，但結果幷此最抵希望亦未達到，蘇聯將美國所提解除德國軍備四十年公約撕成粉碎，尤出意外。少數樂觀之外交家感覺「使問題公開」至少係一種收穫，但大部份人士折出多數問題久已暴露於世。各國現藉率直要求或堅決反對他國要求手段，遂使一切問題益形根深蒂固。先是，各方立塲似涉含糊，尙可無須顧及面子，設法妥協，今則除亦一國或他國切實退讓，不能成立解決矣。莫斯科會議在外交上之唯一具體發展乃法國與西方盟國之加緊密切連繫。蘇聯對德外交政策迫令法國在重大問題上投入西方各國怏抱，以保障其基本安全。簡言之，蘇聯立塲自列寗時代以來始終未變，主張德國强盛，中央藥權且工業化之，此爲法國所最畏懼者。決定蘇聯外長莫洛托夫對薩爾問題之立塲及主張建立强有力德國之要求，於法國共產黨有何影饗，尙未揭曉。但美國務卿馬歇爾鎭靜支援法國，已博得西歐之友誼、同時其要求歸還波蘭目前統治之若干東部農地及其堅決反對蘇聯之賠償要求等等，亦必有其效果。此種宣傳最後價値如何，雖須拭目以待，其將影響於飢饉不安之歐洲，則可斷言。</p>
<h3>下屆四外長會議　本年十一月在倫敦舉行　並設特別委員會討論對奧和約</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿四日電〕四國外長會議於本日午後舉行最後一次會議，通過三項決議：（一）下次四國外長會議於本年十一月間在倫敦舉行。（二）在聯合國大會閉幕之後，或可於九月間在紐約召開臨時四國外長會議。（三）柏林盟國管制委員會，須於六月一日以前，起草一項限制德國佔頜軍之計劃，傳於九月一日起施行。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿四日電〕四國外長會議於本日午後舉行會議時，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫首先發言，答覆美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥昨日所提出主張將奧國問題交聯合國大會解決之一項建議，認爲締結對奧和約採取與締結對義·羅·匈·保。芬五國和約不同之方法，殊無理由可言，乃提議設立一特別四國委員會，負責討論奧國問題。馬帥及英國外相貝文，對此均屬同意。貝文外相並謂此一委員會應實事論事，不應再引起理論上觀點之紛歧。奧國政府應將其境內德國資產製造一表，呈請四國委員會討論。莫洛托夫外長亦表示在原則上表示同意。最後乃決定設立特別四國委員會，討論劉奧和約問題，俾調整四强之意見，並定於五月十二日在維也納召開第一次會議。</p>
<h3>貝文臨行表示　四強團結增強</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿五日電〕英外相貝文今日稱：渠於今晚離莫斯科時應有之感覺爲「四强之團結已較莫斯科會議前增强。」貝文稱：「余信各國詳細交換意見，對進一步之硏究，實最有裨益，余深信日後在　人回憶莫斯科會議時，必將認之爲和平建設中最重要之貢獻之一。」貝文一透露英國對蘇聯要求在德國現有生產中提取賠償事亦決非加以斷然之拒絕，僅稱此前尙有更重要之問題首須解決耳。渠認爲更重要之間題，第一爲求取德國之經濟統一，第二德國之政治體制，第三英國投於德國之資金必先取得償付。</p>
<h3>美蘇恢復談判　韓人表示冷漠　李承晚稱不存奢望</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城廿四日電〕朝鮮美軍佔　區人士，對美蘇聯合委員會恢復談判之前途，意見殊形分歧。右派報紙　政治領袖對於此舉能否解決朝鮮問題，表示懷疑。左派則歡迎蘇聯外長莫浴托夫提議於五月二十日在漢城重開會議，認爲完成朝鮮統一之惟一途徑。自由派「民聲」報評稱，恢復談判可制止反動派單獨設立韓南政府之奸謀。又獨立領袖李承晚向報界聲稱，本人並不以爲美蘇聯合委員會恢復談判如何重要，因吾等不致派遣代表直接參加。余對未來會議不存奢望，余旣不反對亦不擁護該委員會，但若美蘇二國對於目前問題能獲協議，結果自佳，余準備服從其決議。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾啓程返美　抵達華府後將發表廣播　英法外長分乘專車回國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿五日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾已於今晨九里零三分（上海時間今日午後六時零三分）從莫斯科中央飛機塲搭飛機啓程。參加外長會議之美英法三國代表團今日將全體動身，法外長皮杜爾與英外長貝文均定今日乘專車離此。在機塲歡送馬歇爾者，有蘇聯外次維辛斯　，英。法·希臘·伊朗四國大使及美大使史密斯等。馬氏瀕行在機塲談稱：「吾人未獲更大進展，頗以爲憾，抑余認爲吾人追想往日，即可知已完成之工作，實較吾人所明瞭者爲多。余擬於返抵美國後，即向美國人民發表正式播音報吿。」馬氏復對蘇方之招待，表示謝忱，並稱：「余來自年靑而重要之國家。吾人縱然表示不耐，目的亦極誠懇，即欲見和平降臨於世界與人心。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿五日電〕國美務卿馬歇爾，從莫斯科外長會議返美途中，今日道出柏林，小作勾留，對莫斯科會議結果，再度表示失望。渠稱：「余曾切望奧地利和約成立協凝，如今余已不能猜測何時可獲協議。四外長將於九月間紐約舉行之聊合國大會中小聚，十一月復在倫敦正式會議。莫斯科並未討論史達林總理艾德禮首相與杜魯門總統之可能會議。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿四日專電〕美國務卿馬歇爾可於廿六日返抵此間。數日後，將向人民報吿莫斯科會議之經過。此間官方雖未證實渠將向全國廣播外長會議之結果，然一般預料渠定將仿效前國務卿貝爾納斯出席歷次四强會議後向全國廣播之故事。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門總統拒絕評論莫斯科外長會議之結果。渠謂：馬歇爾國務卿返國後，當可親自向美國報吿會議經過。</p>
<h3>外長會議無結果而散　史達林設宴餞別　史氏舉觴祝杜魯門健康</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿五日電〕史達林元帥昨夜在克里姆林宮「藍廳」設宴，招待英法美三國外長及各該國代表國，每國十人。席間英外相貝文坐在史達林之右面，美國務卿馬歇爾坐在左面，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫面向史達林而坐，其右爲法外長皮杜爾，左面則爲蘇聯國際貿易部長密哥耶。蘇聯政治局代表柴達諾夫，貝里亞與馬倫哥夫諸人亦在座作倍。座上並無女賓。食菜極爲講究，並有俄國之各種名酒助興。談話皆避不論及政治題目，空氣極爲友好。賓主祝觴，絕未提及外長會議之不良結果。散席後，復在「紅廳」喝咖啡牛奶等。史達林並邀來賓觀蘇聯著名影片「石中花」，直至午夜零五分，史達林始送說「再會」，貝文答以「托福」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿四日電〕蘇聯總理史達林今夜在克里姆林宮「藍廳」開張盛宴，款待美英法蘇四國外長。史氏即席舉觴，祝美國總統杜魯門健康，此舉或即爲宴會中之特色。史氏之祝　乃應和美國國務卿馬歇爾舉杯留念外長會議工作而起。馬歇爾並即席致詞稱：美國爲年靑國家，未免急躁，「在吾人之急躁中，或可了解吾人對於歐洲之早日和平與繁榮，最爲切望」。</p>
<h3>英參謀會議　定下月召集　美否認裁減海軍</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿四日電〕英帝國參謀會議定五月間舉行，將由陸軍參謀長　帥主持其事，射論有關帝國陸軍之一切問題，屆時印度英軍司令默慶萊克元帥亦將參加。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕參院軍事委員會今日詢問陸海軍部是否有裁减海軍之秘密計劃。據陸軍部長柏特遜答稱，「在統一軍力之建議中，決無削弱海軍戰鬥力之意向。」</p>
<h3>發展英法空軍　兩國交換意見</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫教廿四日電〕法國公共工程及運輸部長莫許，應英國民用航空大臣奈桑之邀請，前來此間，討論發展英法兩國空運問題已歷兩日，頃於本日遄返巴黎。</p>
<h3>英首相演說　駁斥邱吉爾</h3>
<p>〔路透社蘇格蘭聖安特魯廿五日電〕艾德禮首相今日在蘇格蘭工會理事會中發表演說，以答邱吉爾昨日所作之演說。艾德禮謂，邱吉爾之意似欲使英國在印度倒退五十年，邱氏曾謂帝國已被斷送，印度已被拋棄，渠使用此等名辭已歷有年所，渠忽略數十年來印度之自治運動，已放棄戰時所力爭之民主原則。當余在下院宣布印度有權自定其未來命運時，反對黨並無反對之言，余不信英共和邦或美國國內，能有支持邱吉爾之帝國主義者。在此一方面邱吉爾從不思索，一味感情用事。邱吉爾又曾遠及英國已步入破產之途，要知目前之困難，實出源於早期之錯誤，余猶不忘邱吉爾任財相時，乃我國最不幸的財相，渠之採取金本位制，乃吾人今日所受痛苦之根源。</p>
<h3>美駐蘇大使　將返國述職</h3>
<p>蘇大使返抵美任所</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門總統今日招待報界時，對於莫斯科會議及前副總統華萊十在歐洲之游說，均不加以批評。但稱，華萊士之一百五十億美元援蘇計劃，當爲馬歇爾報吿題目之一。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿五日電〕此間悉，華萊士此番訪歐歸去後，將在美國內組織「和平十字軍」。四月三十日華萊士將在紐約向世界發表廣播演說，而後將至芝加哥，舊金山，波特蘭，西雅圖，波斯頓等地，作國內旅行演講。</p>
<h3>華萊士在巴黎　作巡迴演講</h3>
<p>勗法保持共和政體</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿四日合衆電〕華萊士對戴高樂作不指名之攻擊時，三區巴黎市民向華氏起立歡呼。華氏稱，法國必須永爲共和國，不受獨裁思想之流毒，非但爲其自身利益，且爲世界利益亦應如此也。彼並未提起戴高樂之名，但聽衆自知係戴民。今晚演辭爲華氏歐遊之最後一次，明晨彼將飛美。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕華萊士本日向英美記者協會發表演稅稱，余在政治上持中庸之道，故在此次遊歐期內，將避免與極右派或極左派接觸。中庸主義者今日對世界之意義較諸昔日，更爲重大云。華萊士與各記者聚餐後，即往總統府拜會總理賴瑪迪埃。華萊士旋至沙布思大學在巴黎第一次公開集會中發表演說稱，目前世事趨勢，傾向於第三次世界大戰，政洽家加以挽救已嫌其遲，此一趨勢或將因愚蠢之事件或故意之挑潔，而再燃起世界大戰之烽火。余　深恐各國政府與職業外交官，或不能挽還此狂瀾。總之，目前世界危機已在心理　，經濟上及政治上起作用云。</p>
<h3>黃仁霖在美　考察軍事設施</h3>
<p>〔聯合社　　斯州里文胡華要塞廿五日電〕黄仁霖少將今日從奧克賴荷瑪州乘飛機抵此，考察美國軍事設施，副官賴中校與美陸軍部代表梅雅上校同行，午後轉往芝加哥考察軍需庫。</p>
<h3>日衆院選舉預測　自由黨可獲優勝</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿五日電〕據此間政治觀察家預料，今日之衆議院選舉結果，自由黨祗少可得一百四十席，其次民主黨（前進步黨）可得一百二十席，社會民主黨可得一百十席，人民合作黨可得四十席，共產黨可得六席，其他小黨與無黨無派者可得五十席</p>
<h3>英王啟程返國</h3>
<p>〔路透社主力艦先鋒號二十四日電〕英王英后率兩公王，在南非聯邦作一萬六千公里路程之遊歷畢，已於今目啓程返英。</p>
<h3>戴高樂發表政見　有重登政治舞台企圖</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿四日電〕戴高樂頃宣稱：余創設新國民團結運動後，已有數十萬人加入，但余絕無樹立獨裁政權之意。余之目的乃在現有各政黨之上，聯合法國人民，創設稍與現行制度不同之民主政治，使選民可以自由表示其意志。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕戴高樂自在白倫伐爾與斯特拉斯堡二地發表演說，暗示參加政治活動之決意後，今確已重登政治舞台。今日渠在招待記者會所發表之談話，尤爲其採此行動之決定性步驟。所言法國生活當前面臨之困難，法國人民須以共同情緒團結一致發表意見，以發揮政治力量等語，即可窺知其用意。戴高樂且力言現有各政黨未能使人民發表意見，有待其法國人民集合運劃，担當此重大任務。各記者聆聽其高論後，所得印象皆謂戴高樂之政治主張仍與以前相同。戴氏之見解乃認爲目前法國局勢之惡化情形，與一九四〇年不同，但形勢極爲嚴重，而且以爲干預其事乃其義務云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕法國共黨本日發表公報，再度主張在全國各地設立「警備委員會」，以抵制反動派及戴高樂將軍所領導人民團結運動之活動。</p>

<h3>中航機龍華起飛被迫降落　衝出機塲撞斃三人　引擎損壞機輪折斷機師乘客無恙　戴安國乘機抵滬調查眞相</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司滬蘭綫客機，每週一班。昨晨八時五十七分，美籍機師摩爾偕副機師李蔭階，報務員溫永灝駕駛C—四七型第一四一號雙引擎機，上載乘客五名及貨物等，由龍華機塲起飛。不料起飛五分鐘後，（離地僅十公呎）發覺該機左引擎突吿停止，機師遂急用右引擎轉灣於五分鐘內降落機塲東西向跑道。但着陸之際，煞車亦損壞無法控制，致一時衝出跑道外約三百碼，至跑道西端潘家　堂四號宅東北丈餘處方停止。其時該四號宅內居民二女一男共三人，正道經該處擬赴菜塲買菜，被飛機右螺旋槳撞倒畢命。</p>
<p>鄕民三人慘死</p>
<p>該三鄉民爲（一）施沈氏，女，年五十三歲，啓東人，撞傷鼻部出血而死。（其夫施鍋林，年五十四歲，爲中航公司小工，其子施建康三十一歲，業泥水匠）。（二）徐陸氏，女，五十二歲，啓東人，頭額正中劈開。（三）徐一成，男，二十六歲，爲徐陸氏之子，頭部四分之三已劈掉，亦爲中航公司小工。（其父徐惠山，五十四歲，現任敎師）。</p>
<p>機師乘客無恙</p>
<p>機師摩爾頭部略受擦傷甚輕，至其他谷人均僅受虛驚而已。下機　在候機室稍歇，即由公司車送返寓。據悉此次搭乘滬蘭綫班機者原有二十餘人，因近日天氣不佳，故臨時僅有五人上機。而最　僥倖一事，乃該機中尙載有汽油七百加侖，竟未起火。公司當局及熟悉飛行技術者咸稱摩爾之技術殊可佩服。至飛機損失情形，除引擎損壞外，尙有右螺旋槳掉下，降落輪折斷，機腹亦有損傷，至兩翼則均完好。</p>

<h3>解決職工生活重壓　將尋求一折衷方案　與差額金補貼制或稍有不同　現正由社會局詳細研議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市一般薪水階級及產業工人，因不堪高物價之壓迫，目前多矚望於政府即刻能將生活指數解凍。連日已有四區棉紡產業工會，中華書局，報業職工會等分向總工會及社會局作此呼蔽。昨日上海電話公司職工亦呈文總工會要求解凍指數。此次市社會局長吳開先晋京出席全國物價會議時，行政院長張羣曾面詢上海物價波動情形甚詳。因鑒於一般工人受物價高漲影響，入不敷出，不能維持生活，而增加工人薪給又需考慮及資方能否負担，張院長乃面囑吳局長在兩者之間尋求一折衷方案，庶幾工人收入得能維持生活，而資方則不致因而無法生存。該方案與目前之差額金補貼制度或稍有不同，現正由社會局詳細硏議中。</p>

<h3>京滬路謀改進　鋼軌枕木大多腐舊　擬自下月起開始更換</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕奉命來滬調査京滬綫出軋傾覆事件之交通部路政司長　福均，已將調査經過呈京覆命，定於今日上午隨交通部次長凌鴻勛乘機飛平，轉往東北視察路政，並將與東北運輸總局長陳延烱同行。據兩路局負責人昨日語記者稱：連日兩次發生出軌事件，損失甚重，俟局長陳伯莊由京返滬後，即舉行行車事變檢討會議。渠指出該局自復員以來，即擬定恢復計劃及現代化計劃，因外匯及經費之限制，不惟現代化計劃無由實現，即恢復計劃中之增加車輛及更換枕木鋼軌，亦力所不及。渠復稱：該路旣用鋼軌，均係四十年前之輕磅（八十五磅）舊軌，枕木亦多腐舊。爲謀行車安全，恢復飛快車，京滬綫除最近已更換者不計外，至少尙須更換鋼軌三十公里，沈木三十萬根。現鋼軌方面，已備有二十公里之材料，所需各項零件，本月底可配齊交貨，擬自下月日起，開始自南翔站向西更換，兩月後可竣事，所需枕木三十萬根，分向美國，暹羅，合灣訂購，其中除在台灣訂購十萬根之貨款已交付外，在美國及暹羅所訂之二十萬根枕木貨款，因外匯限制尙未付，短期內尙難運來。</p>
<h3>房屋租賃條例　經市參會修正　出租人如無收回必要　仍應由原承租人續租</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會日前將立法院擬訂之房屋租賃條例草案，連同該會　政，法規，社會三委員會建議各點，抄送各參議員，微詢意見。市參議員張一渠頃語記者：原草案第九條第六項規定「約定租賃期限已屆滿者」，出租人得終止契約，現經市參議會修正僞「約定租賃期限屆滿，確有收回自用之必要者」。其意即約定租賃期限屆滿，出租人如無收回自川必要，仍應由原承租人續約承租。此於法於情於理，均尙無不合之處，本人極表贊同云。</p>
<p>房荒依然嚴重分配期限應展長</p>
<p>本市各機關受配曾爲敵僑所住而非敵僞所有之房屋，截至四月三十日止，統一分配辦法，即行屆滿，屆滿後如何辦理，業經政院指示：（一）上海曾經敵僑居住非敵僞所有之房屋，分配期限定於四月三十日截止期滿，由蘇浙皖區處理敵僞產業審議委員會査明後，發還原業主。（二）現在住戶於分配期滿，仍擬繼續租賃者，應逕向原業主洽訂租約。本市參議會負責人，頃就是項問題發表談話稱：本市勝利復員以還，房荒嚴重，去年行政院有鑒及此，遂有統一分配之辦法，然一年以來，房荒嚴重現象，迄未稍减，是項分配辦法，一旦廢止，如果不予被分配者以繼續承租居住之權利，則本市即將有軍公敎及文化團體之人員數萬人，頓吿流離失所，勢必引起社會間極大糾紛。故於三月間第二次大會時，即有提請延長統一承租辦法之議，當經決議辦法兩項：（一）凡經合法分配而無欠租等情之軍公敎人員及文化社團之原居住人，仍准繼續租住，（二）凡經合法分配而一迄未訂立和約者，原業主不得以任何理由加以拒絕，並應迅即訂約。且査本會第一次大會時，對於房屋租賃權一節，於財地字第六號決議案亦有「原承租人有繼續承和權，但直違反民法各項規定等情事者不受此限制」之建議，請立法院於訂定房屋租賃條例時採納施行，其目的，亦在求减少本市因房荒而引起之種種租賃糾紛。茲査行政院明令規定之第二點，一經實施，難免以業主與房客間觀點不同，而仍將發生社會上種種紛擾，爲求消弭是項紛擾計，故本會已經具函本市市政府及地方法院，擬請行政司法各當局査照本會歷次決議，採納辦理云。</p>

<h3>檢察官對「洋老虎」案　最後一小時決定上訴　梅斯伯上訴部份高院亦已受理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「洋老虎」案自地院於本月十四日宣判後，因被吿梅斯伯僅處有期徒刑一年，沒收部份亦僅美鈔四萬元，港幣二萬元，故頗有人注意檢察官是否上訴。原吿密人亦曾呈書建議檢察官上訴。昨爲上訴期最後一天，承辦檢察官全匋考慮再四，乃於昨晚六時決定上訴，當即向刑庭聲明，理由書依法後補。據全檢察官於決定上訴後吿記者稱：此案上訴本早可決定，惟案中涉及鉅額美鈔黄金，因沒收後之金鈔，承辦機關及密吿人可得百分之三十獎金，深恐外界誤爲撿察官爲獎金而上訴，故遲遲不能決定惟本人確亦不服地院刑庭之判決，在檢察官職務上當依法力爭，故在最後一小時上訴期限中，毅然決定上訴。至於沒收金鈔部份，將不擬作數目上之要求，唯求實際數字之準確。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕「洋老虎」荷人梅斯伯非法經營外匯一案，前經地院判處有期徒刑一年，美鈔四萬元及港幣兩萬元沒收。梅斯伯奉判不服，具狀向高院上訴，高院業經受理，該案由王可權推事承辦，聞不日即將開審。</p>
<h3>楊思奇夫人茶會招待　中法文化洋溢交流　她是法國著名狄岱麓獎金創辦人　曾經環遊世界找尋理想夫婦之謎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨天下午，法國總會有一次招待新聞界的茶會，洋溢着中法文化交流的氣氛。主人楊思奇夫人（Modame　Roube　Jansky），是法國狄岱麓學社和巴黎大晚報的代表，一位多才多藝的友學家，音樂家。舞蹈家。楊思奇夫人是法國著名的狄岱麓獎金的創辦人，狄岱　獎金於一九三五年創立，目的爲促進中法文化友誼之流通，計劃在十年以內，每年選派一位法國作家或記者來華遊歷。舉辦兩年以後、因大戰爆發而終止，茲戰爭結束，夫人決定繼續興辦，並且準備擴大其意義，不單由法國選派作家記者來華，由中國亦選派記者作家去法，每年各派一人，爲期四月，一切費用招待等等完全由其負責。</p>
<p>萬事大都齊備獨缺交通工具</p>
<p>人選的抉擇，由獎金委員會主持。法國方面的負責人是前社會黨領袖彼爾彭古，中國方面的負責人是李石曾氏，選派的作家或記者要能多少懂一點對方的語言，俾能深入民間，與多方面接觸。本年度的「交流」事宜，法國方面一切招待佈置，都已田楊思奇夫人準備妥當，中國方面亦已差不多「萬齊齊備」，獨缺的「東風」就是交通工具—旅行必須的飛機問題。夫人昨天特別强調爲望中國政府「帮帮忙！」</p>
<p>研究無形細菌破壞夫婦幸福</p>
<p>楊思奇夫人另外一件極有趣味的事業，是她對於男女婚姻問題的研究。她覺得夫婦的婚姻關係中常常有一種無形的細菌在破壞雙方的幸福，她要追究這究竟是何緣故？因此在過去數十年中，她曾經環遊全球，去找尋一對理想的夫妻。倒底有沒有找到呢？楊思奇夫人昨天柲而不宣，妙要保特這一個謎，等到下星期三（四月三十日）來揭曉。下星期三晚上八時半，夫人將在蘭心大戲院表演一個非常特別的節目，名稱就是「環遊全世界，找尋理想夫妻」，她說其性質近於講演，但是有音樂，舞蹈陪襯，都是她所到過的世界各國婚姻方面的音樂與舞蹈。夫人除法語以外，僅能說很生硬的英語，但是她說在表演的那一天，將用一種現在暫守秘密的語言，保證每位中國的觀衆都能够了解，我們且等着瞧她的「理想夫妻」吧！</p>

<h3>且看星島軍如何打漢城　南北足球兩傑　今日會師逸園</h3>
<p>千呼萬喚始出來之港星島足球隊，因氣候關係，一再展延行程，至昨日下午三時三刻，始由港搭中國航空公司四引擎大客機起飛，除領隊胡好因事未克同行。改於今日啓程外，餘由副領隊沈頌芳率領，一行十九人於七時卅分飛抵滬上，在江灣機塲降落，事先有電到滬，且因體協會設筵康樂酒家招待，爲免往返周折，故除該隊幹事歐陽誠前往引導外，餘均在康樂等候，全體下機後，即驅車至金門飯店，將行李安置，嗣即往康樂赴宴。是宴到星島漢城兩球隊外，其餘作陪之東華，靑白，鐵路，蘇聯，猶太諸隊隊員，裁判會會員，警備部警察局各長官，曁各報體育記者不下二百餘人，賓主歡聚一堂，暢飲高談至十一時許始散。</p>
<p>星島隊到滬後，對漢城之戰，已決定於今日午後四時在逸園舉仃，一時起在市體育館發售門票，票價五千八千兩種，爲免擁擠起見，逸園三處大門同時開放。</p>
<p>今日星島及漢城兩隊出塲陣容，昨已分別決定，探誌如下：</p>
<p>星島</p>
<p>金耀德　劉天申　侯榕生　宋靈聖　許竟成　劉松生　曹秋亭　　文治　張金海　朱永強　何應芬</p>
<p>（生力軍）馮坤勝黎兆榮劉廣才</p>
<p>漢城</p>
<p>車淳鐘　朴大鐘　朴奎楨　朱榮光　金奎煥　閔丙大　鄭南湜　鄭國振　金容植　林暢植　禹晶煥</p>
<p>（生力軍）安鉀秀崔成坤閔丙翊</p>
<p>按星島門將金耀德馳譽香島，今日必不辱使命，後衛劉侯二將均能勝任愉快，前衛綫更見人才濟濟，尤以左脚王許竟成進攻退守，兩得其便，前鋒鄒何帶球熟練，朱　年輕力壯，陷陣兇猛，張金海掛印中鋒，領導指揮，輔以小三子曹秋亭，如虎添翼，陣容强硬異常，漢城雖兇，難有把握。</p>
<p>漢城在滬戰續，堪稱優異，快速度之密集進攻，足以窺見其水準之高，越戰越見精彩，致全滬盟主東華，亦遭毒手，此番待戰星島，蓄銳養精，已有多日，今日與遠來勞師接戰，已得十分便宜，然星島稱覇南國，豈是弱者，故屈時一番龍爭虎鬥，必有許多精彩緊張之鏡頭也。</p>

<h3>友誼賽中　交大逼和漢城</h3>
<p>漢城足球隊，原定昨日下午五時與星島交鋒，因星島未能準時到達，遂改與交大作練習賽。三時半比賽開始，由張劍冰任裁判，上半時漢城攻勢頻繁，射門達十五次之多，均爲交大門將秦鼎新撲出，一無所獲，二十分鐘後，交大後衛奚祖楨禁區犯手球，漢城禹晶煥操刀，中秦鼎新身上彈出，至終塲俞五分鐘，漢城中鋒金容植力射中鵠，上半時漢城遂以一比〇佔先。</p>
<p>易地後，交大體育部顧問李雅谷贈漢城錦旗一面，當由漢城指導金容植接受。開賽後球仍盤旋於交大門前，秦鼎新生意興隆，應接不暇，交大祗求少輸，前鋒均回防助守，漢城終不得逞，十二分鐘時，交大中堅劉隆馨得球急傳中路，鄭鏡彤帶球疾進，遞與左翼，吳安騙過朴金楨，舉足叩門，從左角入網，扳成平局，此後雙方互有攻守，迨法定時間完畢，一對一交大逼和漢城。</p>
<p>漢城洪德泳朴大鍾朴金楨朱榮光金奎煥閔丙大鄭南湜鄭國振　金容植　林湜植禹晶煥</p>

<p>晨開</p>
<p>升降俱微，景綸新股開價過賤，籌碼極少，開後立吿漲停。遞水紗開後由八二號二二六號二三二號二二四號爭先了結，自四五〇〇元步降至四三五〇元。八五號九一號二三五號二三一號七六號趁低稍納，升上一百元，終以港申電回漲，人心怯軟，二三五號八五號二一一號九四號一六五號再供，故戶亦售，跌至四二九〇元。六九號二二四號一六九號二二三號四號一四號六一號八九號一六〇號一九〇號二二六號紛購，內衣由四三號一七三號進至漲停，而將遞永紗拉高至四五三〇元。二一八號一一七號六五號二三一號一三七號二三號二一一四號一五三號尙賣，又迫低至四三九〇元。三六號一八五號二二四號一五三號八五號一五一號來進，加上信和由一四號四號一六〇號二三五號九五號均進，驟起漲風，仍見堅定，盤旋而上，火柴由一五八號二二四號亦掛漲停，一五四號二二三號六九號七七號一四號二二號二一五號再進，一五二號力購現遞永紗，忽傳紗布有自由賣買訊，近午漲到四六一〇元。七三號一〇六號二一八號脫售而後轉盤，新光亦以高價結束。結果較前收計信和永公漲一成，華調美亞升半成强，中法永紗微升，景福新華新光平平。遞交計永公升一成，永紗美亞華豐新光景福微升，信和漲一成不到。冷股景綸火柴內衣漲停，中絲平平，中紡統益新亞各升半成，餘股榮辱俱微。</p>

<p>江海關於昨晨十時起，實行禁止紗布自由報關轉運出口，凡無紡織管理委員會許可證者，一律不准報關轉口，輸往外埠各口岸。海關稅務司並於昨晨通知各報關行知照。昨晨海關發出通吿後，紗布已不能自由報運轉口，至紡管會方面核辦許可證事宜，因各項手績尙未辦妥，致未能即行開始，目前紗布轉運出口已吿絕跡，紗布市塲受此刺激，各檔棉紗市價昨均突吿大跌云。</p>

<h3>遵照市長限價　米糧漲風稍歛　店號有市無貨人心不安</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨因吳市長嚴令白粳交易不得越十六萬，門售不得過十七萬，漲風因而稍歛。南北兩市塲共到貨一六四八石。市塲因有經濟警察密佈調齊，故黑市交易頗難做開。白粳晴盤站定十九萬。薄稻十八萬八，羊秈十八萬五千。白元則昇挺至廿一萬。社會局繼續拋出白粳，紅尖。及西貢共九千包。各米號因白粳官價限十七萬，做黑市則受嚴懲，遂多以次貨應市。</p>
<p>又訊：米糧暗市昨日雖稍見鬆動，但米號均竟有市無貨，致人心益見惶恐。</p>
<p>麵粉市勢穩定，洋粉十萬　千，本粉七萬三千五百。吉普桶生油漲至五十萬。豆油則挫落至四十九萬。麻油五十一萬。大連黄豆十六萬二千。生仁漲至廿七萬，芝蔴二十萬。</p>

<h3>存紗限期出售</h3>
<p>昨日現紗市况，塲外初開尙平，迨後以吳市長面諭，紗業公會三月十五日以前購存之棉紗，現貨棧單，均須於五月一日以前售出，人心頓吿下游，42支藍鳳晨開小至一二五〇萬，後爲一一五〇萬，20支特雙馬五六〇萬，均比前下降一成左右。</p>
<h3>補繳證件各戶　紡建恢復配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國舫建公司昨日對補繳證件，覆騐合格各戶，又陸續恢復配售。此中計針織業十九戶，內衣業三戶，手帕業三戶，毛巾被毯業六戶，帆布業一戶。另有若干戶，因稅單遺失，前亦經停配在案。茲該公司爲顧念生產廠商工人生計問題起見，姑准於下週一（廿八日）起開貨。此中計針織業卅七戶，毛巾被毯業六戶，手帕業四戶，內衣樂一戶，帆布業一戶。</p>
<h3>布市明鬆暗緊</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，塲外喊開現貨居多，蓋聞粵漢帮等報關手續辦妥者，稍有添進，賣戶遂乘機扳持，行情轉緊。廠家對白坯細布，補胃仍健，龍頭細布價喊二十七萬元，二十支特細布二十二萬元，四者子金印元嗶嘰，價由二十二萬三千元步高至八千元。前日紡建供售金建妙舞元嗶嘰，數額不多，致價奇俏，爲二十三萬元。散戶扒吸甚强，惟至收時聞紗價回小，有獲利吐售，市情遂轉疲軟。</p>
<h3>呢羢價仍堅秀</h3>
<p>呢羢標準市價昨仍明暗堅秀，交易亦不弱。淡色薄花呢趨勢始終俏活。白帆布蔴膠布與做香港衫之百福呢，現定及成交均頗夥，南洋幫續有裝辦。財神虎華達呢售價則獨平疲，因其出品遠較老裝貨爲遜。新貨質薄而軟，故客方均欲搜辦老貨，奈老貨早已斷檔，市上所流通者祇有新貨，致其售價反不若協新華綸諸牌爲堅挺。</p>
<h3>陝棉存底尙豐</h3>
<p>據悉：本年各地棉花，經紡建收購者，已達一百五十萬担左右。價格多因大量收購而激漲，近更變本加厲，各地市價多高於滬市，致一般棉商均感無法收買。僅西安一地，因運輸困難，市價獨較各地爲低，存貨亦豐，聞總額約有一百五十餘萬噸。</p>

<h3>旅大區域的邊緣</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>瀋陽十九日航訊</p>
<p>遼東半島，一派好春光，呌從北部來的人們，覺得這裏有無限的生機。但，過去它正演過很多的「歷史悲劇」，今天，硝烟，彈雨，還在這裏響着，瀰漫着，國計民生，都面臨着絕境。</p>
<p>歷史上的悲劇，多半是國際性的，八十七年前，英法聯軍來侵，英國艦隊會經一度佔據了它，「維多利亞灣」的名號，當時轟動一時。</p>
<p>甲午一役，日本佔據了旅大和遠東半島，四十九年前，俄人又恃强把旅大租到手裏，四十三年前，日本打敗了俄國，旅大和遼東半島，又被日人染指，日人施行四十多年的統治，壓榨，居住在裏邊的人們，老的故去了，小的幾乎不熟知祖國。</p>
<p>在蘇軍控制下　與祖國隔斷了</p>
<p>前年，世界二次大戰結束，東北光復，旅大和遼東半島，又在蘇軍控制下和祖國隔斷了，同時共軍，更把這裏拉上了一層圍幕，致使這塊地方，越發的解體，越發的擈朔迷離。</p>
<p>目前，國人和世界人士，都期待着，期待着中蘇尊重友好條約精神，把不合理的地方，尋求合理的解決，使中國得能恢復政權，世界人士得能自由來去，那前途纔有生機，纔能大放光明。</p>
<p>警戒綫大門外　共軍工事在望</p>
<p>普蘭店從去年起成了一個世界聞名的鎭市，它站在了旅大區域的邊綠，也就是中蘇友好條約所規定旅順海軍根據地警戒綫的大門外。</p>
<p>從普蘭店到石河，南北有廿五里的距離，東海岸到西海邊，長度也不過百里地，就在這個長約百里寬約廿多里的狹長區域裏，活動着共軍。</p>
<p>走上普蘭店南邊的一個呌做「南山」的小山，或者到北面的「台山」，舉目遠矚，「亞海灣」碧綠的海水，映入了眼簾，東南方近處山頭，共軍所做的「工事」，明晰可睹。</p>
<p>西南方的遠遠的高山上，蘇軍的山巔堡壘，豁然在望。那方山脚後，就是有名的石河了，石河站，除了蘇軍，還有穿着靑制服的所謂「地方保安隊」。</p>
<p>中蘇第一綫上將領二度晤談</p>
<p>記者在南山上瞭望，西南方飛着越過了石河上空的蘇聯飛機，繞着灣子又飛回南方去。附近的山頭，還時常的饗着幾響快槍，或兩三發轟然的砲聲。</p>
<p>普蘭店中蘇第一綫將領的兩次晤談，又惹起了好多世人的注目，近期或者還要來幾次，地點也許將在蘇軍駐在地的石河進行。</p>
<p>聽說在第二次晤談的時候，我方曾向蘇軍査理斯基將軍表示，擬往石河或金縣來一次回拜。査理斯基說：「甚爲歡迎，但須請示後纔能答覆，惟安全問題，不能員貴，因吾等此次前來，途中還受到不明部隊的射擊。」</p>
<p>一批批的難民　由普蘭店來瀋</p>
<p>國軍和共軍對峙，蘇軍在遴方瞧着，從大連，金州，登沙河，一批一批逃出來的難民，通過了這個區械，跑到普蘭店來，然後北去瀋陽。</p>
<p>記者站在普蘭店的南口，看到扶老携幼北來的難民，經過卡口國軍和警察的嚴密檢査，走到招待站去。</p>
<p>問他們爲什麽逃出來，回答是：「沒有生意做，換不出飯來吃，那只有逃難了。」他們拿着地方機關所開的「探親」路條，坐火車到達了金州。</p>
<p>遇到零星蘇軍　須化「買路錢」</p>
<p>難民描畫逃難情形是這樣的；過了金州，，就要徒步了，遇到零星的蘇軍，時常得花些「買路錢」，石河是一個阻　路的關口，他們得在深夜動身，登山爬嶺，繞過石河，摸索的走，驚懼的跑，拂曉後，就可走到五里台了。</p>
<p>「五里台」，駐有共軍檢査，徵稅，然後放行，因爲他們認爲是貨物的，就要徵收一筆稅，否則是不准繼續北上的。經過距離普蘭店十五里的「長店舖」，就是「寡婦橋」。</p>
<p>寡婦橋　兩不管　石河外　怪木牌</p>
<p>「寡婦橋」，是普蘭店南邊五六里地所謂國共兩不管的地方，那裏有專做兌錢生意的販子，兌換率是紅軍票一百廿元換流通券一百元。普蘭店和石河間的狹長區域裏，是一個錯綜複雜的世界。不久前，石河北郊，還立着一個「蘇聯滿洲國境」的奇特木牌，據說現在已經把這個字句塗去了。</p>
<p>爭取整個解決　決不零星接受</p>
<p>四月六日，中蘇第一綫將領會談，因適値中蘇政府關於旅大問題互有文吿發表的時候，因而惹起了世人的重視，事後獲知，蘇方此次是在於試探我方口風，同時也是爲了答覆我方前次所提接防「窿子店」問題而來。蘇方表示，窪了店現僅有少數蘇軍駐守，在保護這個旅大水源地，如果我們能够保證這個水源地不遭受破壞，他們很願意交出，我們爲了求得整個旅大問題的解決，所以不願零星的接受。</p>
<p>窪子店，是在普蘭店和石河間狹長的區域裏，從普蘭店向東南走上三十多里的路程就到了，這是一個旅大水源地。</p>
<p>國軍突出地帶　電話常搖不通</p>
<p>窪子店北方十里地外的「唐家房」，就有國軍駐紮着，那是我們國軍較爲突出的地帶，我們和蘇軍的聯絡，就是靠這裏。</p>
<p>這個十多里的距離，由着中蘇兩方架設一條電話綫，溝通着消息，蘇方有事時，把電話搖過來，我們有事時，電話就搖不通了，必須拿着聯絡符號去接洽，還必須有武裝弟兄們保衛，因爲中途有共軍的射擊。</p>
<p>電話通與不通，關鍵在蘇軍，因爲蘇軍有事時纔把電綫銜接在一起，辦完事隨着就拆離了，那我們怎能搖得通呢？</p>
<p>蘇軍歡迎記者　不負安全責任</p>
<p>記者和大公，新聞，益世，以及瀋腸的「中蘇」，「和平」，六報記者，打算到旅大金州去訪問，聯名致旅順蘇軍總司令的函件，就是從這裏轉達的，惜乎得到的是「歡迎你們來，但，蘇軍不負安全責任」的答覆，把我們拒絕於門外了。</p>
<p>遼東半島的觸角，一切使人迷惑，旅大的區域的睦路門戶以外，又燃燒着戰火，每個人在祈　着：「戰火熄滅吧，觸角復活明朗吧，否則是不可收拾的。」</p>
<p>擬訪旅大各報記者在普蘭店與金縣縣長潘哲及國軍負責人合影（左起第三人脫帽者爲本報記者韓淸濤，右起第三人爲潘縣長）　（本報昆明特派員徐繼濂攝）</p>
<h3>昆明三刼</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員徐繼濂</p>
<p>十九日　昆明航訊</p>
<p>昆明總算是寗靜了一段較長的時候的，不諭是在生活方面，或是在社會秩序方面，都有一股比較安定的力量在支持着，固然，物價也是不停地往上爬，但這一個商業的城市，大風浪總還是少見的。</p>
<p>於是爬過了冬天，又看到了春景，跟着夏天又來臨了，不過在「四季無寒署，一雨便成冬」的情况之下，人們都很不注意於季節的遞變，而且，天候的變化也幾乎難得覺察出來，誰有工夫留意這些最不値得談論的事？因此，一切都照一定的程序進行着，沒有風浪，沒有變化，天候如此，天候以外的事情亦復如此。</p>
<p>溫泉刦車　乘客只剩衫袴</p>
<p>可是一向靜謐的城市，一時接連發生了若干恐怖事件，常然擾亂社會秩序的，不外搶，偸，燒，殺，這些事情，不想昆明近十天來，這些不安的現象便兼而有之，而且正是一速串地搬了出來，使一向過慣了安逸生活的居民，平添了許多意外的驚恐。</p>
<p>昆市附近的安寗溫泉，那是早負盛名的。養疴，游覽，洗礦泉浴，溫泉都算是最適宜的地方，這條短短三十多公里的公路上，大卡車，小轎車，每天都是不停地穿梭來往，誰會担心着行旅的安全呢？可是十三日那天，却偏偏有人會看上了安寗溫泉賓館的大客車，攔路來了一次洗刦，向天鳴槍，聲勢汹汹，五個匪徒向車客們顯出了威武，澈底來一次「抄靶子」。乘客們可也眞慘，只剩得短褲汗衫回城，土匪們揚長而去，不知所之。</p>
<p>驚人刦案　深夜大顯身手</p>
<p>當局正在注意這些明火執仗，胆大妄爲的匪徒行蹤，却不想另外一些匪徒們居然敢在鬧市裏大顯神通，四月十七日夜裏四點鐘，正是大家好夢方酣的時候，正義路顯店巷二號盧鏡卿公館，（盧鏡卿爲滇省主席盧漢之三弟。）竟又發生了空前未有的驚人大刦案！</p>
<p>說來眞有點敎人難於置信，出事後，偵緝隊還不曾到來査勘，記者便趕到了盧公館，當時盧太太尙有餘悸，她描述着被刦的經過情形，幾乎有點近似「江湖奇俠傳」中的事跡，她說：十七日那天夜裏正是黑黝黝的天氣，正矇矓入睡時，題徒不知如何便來到床前了，半中西式的套房，開了兩套彈簧鎖的門，竟然神不知鬼不覺的，把人從床上呌了起來，而且也不蒙面化裝，是個個子頎長面貌淸癯的中年人，一身灰色西服十分整齊，有如多年的熟客，連平日飼養的三隻機警狼犬，也靜悄悄地不出聲息，他敎盧太太褪下身上的飾物，交出自衛手槍，不許她說話，否則槍下便不留情。</p>
<p>匪劫金鈔　逼盧太太繳出</p>
<p>一切都很順利，最奇怪的是道個匪徒完全淸楚盧公館藏有的一些金鈔數目，他能一樣樣地敎盧太太取了出來，計刦去美鈔一萬元，拖拉一百個，葉金六十兩，越幣七百元，首飾數十件，總値是很可觀的。</p>
<p>匪徒得逞後，反扣房門。一步便蹤上了屋，簡直是身輕如燕，等到盧家以電話通知五分局時，匪徒早已遠颺了，案情是相當複維的，連偵緝隊也感到非常棘手，匪徒在行刦時曾聲言：「我本人並不需要這些東西，我是××黨，這些金鈔是拿來接濟人的」。匪徒身份不能確定，只好加以偵査，以期早日破案。</p>
<p>南屏戲院　恐嚇爆彈齊來</p>
<p>奇妙的事緊接着生，十八日晚上昆市的一家大戲院南屛又突然發生爆炸案了，那正是八時場剛剛放映的時候，轟然一聲，一時秩序大亂，座椅紛飛，其中MN排座位被毁，觀衆重傷者達十人之多。事後往參觀者絡繹於途，出事地點有圖形土坑一個。據傷者說：出事之前，曾有一軍人坐在勞邊，忽然彎腰拾物，隨即離院，瞬間便發生爆炸慘劇了。　記者也曾訪問過戲院的負責人，據說當日下午曾經來過一位穿白色雨衣的中年人，持信投往該院售票處、後啓封始知爲一匿名恐嚇信，謂自即日起，限一週內將國幣一千萬元置於S排第十號座位上，否則即有彈爆裂等語，戲院方面當即通知警局，警局也派出便衣警探相候，不料當日便發生了爆炸案，眞有些播手不及。</p>
<p>限期破雜　懸賞一千萬元</p>
<p>接述發生這樣無頭無腦的恐怖事件，當然是頗足令人重視的，而且聽說大光明和昆阱兩家戲院也曾接到同樣的恐嚇信，山城的空氣有點騷動。日來警局正加緊密訪，省府盧主席也曾手令限期破案，懸賞每案一千萬元，此風決不可長，因爲昆明這小小的山城需要有股安定的力量。</p>
<p>初夏給山城帶來了新的恐怖，但願這只是一陣輕微的夏風，今後又回復到以往的平靜。</p>
<h3>南山屐痕</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>杭州十九日訊</p>
<p>春深了，潘公展先生和夫人唐冠玉先生由菱湖到杭州來，唐先生是女畫家，擅山水，花卉，翎毛。我們遊過了靈隱，盪舟在湖上，見那很多自然蒼綠的顏色中，許多建築物被漆成一簇簇刺眼的朱紅。唐先生不禁太息，我也覺得太俗氣，如果這朱紅的顏色再增加，則整個柔美的湖山要爲之减色了。我記起一位新進作家「無名氏」對我談起西子的美來，他說：「到現在爲止，西子湖的自然美還是超越了人工的彫琢，而西子湖如果說已經別具匠心，加了人工的培植，那麽這高聳在孤山上的金碧輝煌的房子，以及湖裏邊不中不西的博覧會紀念塔，私人自由愛好而破壞氣氛的建築，那漆得血般紅的一座座建築物，都看不出』點已經精密設計爲西子湖點綴得更美麗的地方來。」是的，花園都市也好，文化城也好，都要很多高雅的藝術家來設計規劃的。</p>
<p>潘唐二先生和記者在下一天驅車上虎跑寺，唐先生愛品茶，虎跑寺內賣茶葉的人捧了幾包茶葉來，龍井最上的明前賣九萬元一斤，次號爲八萬元一斤，最好的一種名爲野茶，要十九萬元一斤。賣茶葉的把幾種茶葉都泡了給我們嚐，野茶不是生在茶林裏的茶樹，是異常難得的。色明美而味香醇，又加上虎跑的泉水，這水是含有礦質的，滿滿一杯水還可以加水半杯而不流溢。諭價，似較新市塲一帶爲廉，新市塲茶舖內的明前，要賣到十二萬元一斤了。</p>
<p>再前進，到六和塔，塔高十三層，潘先生和我登塔，只能到第七層，和尙對我們說：「七層已經到頂了，是兩層併一層的。」我們不相信，在寺門前望塔高，見第九層上有人，於是細細的推敲，原來眞是兩層併一層，有一層是假的。在塔顛瞭望，可以俯覽錢江大橋和錢江的「之」字形，世界有名的學府建築之江大學，也在塔的右下側。由六和塔下來，上九溪十八澗去，我們身人這兩旁翠巒之中，見漫山矮矮的茶樹，很多年輕的姑娘，她們浴在暖烘烘的陽光裏，用手來摘取鮮嫩的茶葉，放在籮筐裏。</p>
<p>踏過了幾條板橋，橋下涓涓的流水，它擊在亂石上，成了一種最悅耳的音樂。我們這樣地踏過了九頂平板橋，已到了九溪茶塲。這裏搭着一個大凉棚，由茶塲上賣茶與賣酒菜，很多人在此地憇息，在砌成一個缺口的地方，上面用搪磁牌製成「洗脚處」三個字，掛在缺口處。另外有幾隻面盆，上面也掛着一塊搪磁牌，製成「洗臉處」三字。我看到這兩塊搪磁牌，深感這主人確有一些高雅的氣息。</p>
<p>越過九溪茶塲，便是十八澗綴於衆山之間，每一澗都有相當的距離，而澗與澗間却是一條貫通的溪流。流水琤琮，淸可鑑底，很多亂石在水下露出它光滑而又明亮的色彩。人須從澗間跨石而過，有些愛要子的人，赤脚涉水過澗，原來兩旁樹木森森，竹林叢叢，現在則已砍伐幾盡，顯得比從前荒蕪了。如果管理風景的人不再加以整理，那麽時日一久，也將沒有人來玩這些地方了。</p>
<p>過十八澗，便是龍井村，那裏有一點樹木，村依溪水而建，整潔可愛，家家戶戶，都放着一兩張桌子，舖着整潔的檯布，置着多隻玻璃杯，裏邊放着茶葉，門前都貼着一張紅紙，上寫「本戶出售眞正明前龍井」。到龍井寺，那裏還有很多樹木，淸乾隆帝來杭時兩度住在這裏，此處可俯覽西湖，有一些假山，山後有井一口，住持和尙已將淸時雲狀的矮石攔用水泥築成半圓的井欄，井中有小魚，和尙爲我們述說龍井獅峯僅有十二棵是御茶樹，其他的都是後植的。茶樹愈在高山愈好，愈到平地則愈差，在高山上的茶樹不多，故較名責。我問他：「爲什麽這種茶不外銷」？</p>
<p>他說：「茶葉產得太少了」。我想外國人喝茶是豪飲的，並且喜歡刺激性濃重的欽料，我們中國人是喜歡「品」的，所以這種名貴的綠茶能够行銷在我們國內，這也或許因爲外國與中國傳統哲學的不同所致吧？</p>
<p>從龍井寺出來，繞登龍井翁家山抵獅峯，這裏賣茶葉的規模已較龍井村爲大，「翁隆盛」「翁龍盛」「翁隆盛×記」都出現在這裏，在「翁隆盛」的對面，有一所「翁氏宗祠」，但裏面神位僅一兩個，我問僅有的一位店員神位爲何如此少？他說：「假使全入祠，放不下了，所以逐漸火化了」。賣茶葉的用玻璃杯泡茶，水有些烟火的味道。唐冠玉先生責他賣茶葉不會泡茶葉。這位店員一點不圓通，生硬硬地與客人做賣買。我們都說他要圓通靈活一些才好。</p>
<p>在龍井的風景區裏，我們僅見龍井村是有一些美好的意味的，而其他各處，都未加整理。</p>
<p>下坡往烟霞洞，樹木也算不少，洞內的石刻很好，尤其洞門前的兩尊觀世音，牠的手是刻得非常美妙，但不知是誰已巷這兩尊石觀音塗上胭脂與口紅，在洞門前遙望見樹木蔥蘢，像一片烟霞，留在眼底。我們又進側邊門，有茶莊一處，再進內，則有橡數間，建築得非常雅緻，而且文士題咏也多，可惜沒有加以整理，已爲塵灰所矇蔽了。這裏在戰前是吃素齊最著名的地方，現在因爲遊客稀疏，所以顯得凋零殘敗。再拾級下坡到水樂洞，這裏巍巍的寺院已遭摧毁了。這洞的住持現正與凈慈寺的住持在打官司，洞的住持說凈慈寺住持把他趕跑了，又說凈慈寺的住特是個漢奸和尙。這個洞是加以人工的彫琢的，然而他們因爲沒有人指導，所以還是以一些石鐘石鼓爲號召，而新添的東西是很庸俗啊！</p>
<p>繞道過滿覺隴在當桂花盛開的時節，這裏自有一番熱鬧，但我們所見的還是破破落落的房屋，桂枝雜在亂草叢中。到石屋洞，那裏正在修建新的大殿，洞內的一尊尊小菩薩在募化裝金，有許多菩薩已裝金了弄得「金碧輝煌」。</p>
<p>在南山短短的遊程裏，我們三個人都有同樣的感覺，第一是許多名勝古蹟都在開始荒蕪了，而許多管理名勝古蹟人僅注意他眼前的近便的一些地方。第二是遊人已沒有從前人的雅興，爬山越水的往各處去探勝。由這裏我們看出現在的人們是在忙亂中，並且也不能超脫這俗念，這些俗念萌生在心底，容易變爲功利，變爲功利而爭鬥。我們在風景區的人士，尤其是管理風景者，應該想辦法引導他們到較遠的較淸雅的地方去玩。庶幾他們偸閒幾日的功夫，也可消除一些俗念。</p>

<h3>達金頓的遺作</h3>
<p>— 趙影深</p>
<p>我在本刋談到過美國小說家達金頓（Booth　Tarkcington）逝世。現在他的遺作「古董一（Show　Piece）已經出版了。</p>
<p>遺作常是很有興趣的，有時甚至是未完稿，這本「古董」也是未完稿。開端觀念的發展，結構的修整，人物的眞實，在故事沒有完成以前，都不能達到成功的地步。我們對於「古董」只能得到一個空的結稱的骨架。小說還沒有完成，我們只好滿足於作者所加的脚註，他在脚註中說到這點事應該怎樣進行。我相信，只要他有時間，他會好好地修改他的作品的。</p>
<p>所謂古董，就是皮斯（Irvie　Pease）先生，用他作爲第一身稱來寫。我們把皮斯放在古董店裏或玻璃匣裏或者更加恰當一些。但他夏天却住在米德淮斯特城，平常却住在潑林斯頓聖林裏攻讀。他是唯一的自私者，不喜歡幽默。他被他那溺愛的父母和朋友們所喝采，捧得高高的，於是他生活在虛偽的成功狂裏面。他曾編一劇本，博得當地人士的讚美，還得到最崇高的一位女性的戀愛。這時他已在大學畢業。</p>
<p>他能騙得大家稱讚他，全靠他那表弟單撲，隔鄰愛瑪和他那忠心的奴僕。劇中最好的一塲就是留樸寫的。愛瑪這可憐的靈魂，在風浪中駛船，曾經救過皮斯和他的女兒馬麗。愛瑪謊說他自己是一個英雄。後來這謊話被馬麗拆穿，就嫁了別人。</p>
<p>這是一本憂鬱的書，彷佛達金頓已無力跨過這個世紀。倘若這書在早年出版，或許是更値得讚美和熱愛的作品。</p>
<h3>關於莎士比亞</h3>
<p>— 陳家驊</p>
<p>沙士比亞生常英國的黑暗時代，那時英國的一般貴族，浸淫在宗敎的禁慾思想裏，國民也大都沉滯在無振作的狀態中，知識十分低落。</p>
<p>而後，英國接受了外來的藝術，尤其西班牙光輝的文學，及歐洲文藝復興的影響，促使英國文學的勃興，這樣，依利莎白時代，便成了英國文學史上的不可磨滅的一頁了。</p>
<p>莎士比亞便是這時代最重要的一員，他的創作，充滿着樂觀主義，並有不少的貴族成份。</p>
<p>他的學問非常廣博，他是個優秀的多產作家，每部作品都有他不朽的價値；他是前無古人，後無來者的世界文學巨匠。</p>
<p>莎士比亞生於一五六四年的四月二十三日，他是個農家之子，家境很貧苦，沒有受過好好的敎育，他不過在小學裏唸了幾年拉丁文而已。他做過小販，做過律師的書記。十八歲時，與一位長他八歲的婦人安哈薩惠結婚。</p>
<p>足足有十年之久，他的生活十分潦倒，甚至於被誣爲偸竊東西，而逃往倫敦。</p>
<p>生活雖然折磨着年靑的莎士比亞，使他常常餓肚，沒有好好的睡覺，但對知識的追求地始終沒有放棄。一五九二年，他已從苦工跳向爲戲院的優伶。</p>
<p>因爲他的天才，他不斷努力的結果，他的演技受到了大多數人的歡迎，這時他不但是一個名角，而且已是劇作家的姿態，出現在社會中了。</p>
<p>在二十四年的創作生涯中，他的成就是驚人的，同時代的偉大文豪，比如：但丁，薄尤季，西萬提斯都沒有趕上他的。他的作品的藝術造詣，可說已達到極致。</p>
<p>他的創作，是取材於現實的，歷史的，都有一種十分感人的魄力。他用種種的穿插，把社會的黑晴，哀樂，憎恨，美醜，以詼諧的，美妙的，精緻的，各種不同的手法，自然地滲入他的作品中去，他不但是劇作的巨匠，他的詩，也有獨特的風格。「十四行詩集」及「維那斯和亞多尼斯」，他用生花的筆鋒，描下了優美的饒章？所以，歐美一般批評家說莎士比亞的作品的美妙，不朽的價値，是歐洲文藝復興時代的精髓，是歐洲文學的總匯。</p>
<p>在一六一六年一個同他誕生相同的日子裏，莎士比亞以五十二歲的年齡逝世了，結束了他輝煌的一生。</p>
<p>現在，距他誕生及逝世的日于，已均有三百年以上，但他所遺留下來的傑作，却仍放着異樣的光彩，他的遺作的出版，翻譯，已普及到全世界的每個角落，簡直沒有國家民族的限制，而且大家都視同聖經一樣。</p>
<p>現在在歐美發掘莎學，硏究莎學，已爲一般文學家及學者所注意，莎士比亞協會，先後成立起來，而且經常出版着關於莎士比亞文學遺產的硏究或報導的各式集子。</p>

<p>春雨</p>
<p>山國又來了春天了。</p>
<p>雖然春天沒有帶來了一份溫暖，可是春雨是連綿的。</p>
<p>一直從那個寒冷的冬日裏起，我就懷思着溫暖的春天了。我會輕輕地哼起春天之歌，或是向着樹叢的枝頭叩詢那春天的行蹤。甚至，我還計算着那一串凍結了的日子，我是欣幸的，我相信春天能給我生命以健康與希望，我相信着春天是像一個莊發動人的詩篇。在那裏，我是能够聽到自己靑春的高貴與美　的。</p>
<p>不然，我想，我怎能深信：春天是我們的呢？</p>
<p>確鑿，時節是那樣忠實於人世間的。如今，渡過了那個冰雪封住了的季節，春天是那樣愉快地到來了。雖然，他是那樣多愁的，像一位羞澀的少女，把一串悠長的時日在憂悒裏度去。雖然，他是那樣抑揚地，像一把古琴，奏起了一些輕微的希望與蘭珊的情意。許是掏啓了生命的峭寒的窗子似的。</p>
<p>然而，春天總還是春天呵…</p>
<p>每天，我追懋着會經失去的春天，我心情寥落地懷着一份希望坐在窗前。在這裏，一匹山倔强地遮任了我的視綫，我不能望得很遠，祗能看着山道旁的一排松木和梯地上的一片綠秧，或是一叢矗立的羣山，偶而，我能瞧見那灰茫底天，有那一朶朶的白雲航過，或是一片山霧　甸甸地飄落山間。——我是安靜的，捺住了心尖的跳動。</p>
<p>雖然我也曾想走出這灰色的屋子，去訪問那萌綠的草原，或是一校無申助地伸着手臂的梧桐。然而，天是那樣有興的下着綿雨</p>
<p>我沒有忘懷，在這一段日子裏，我是沒有雨鞋而生活曰着的，因此我要安慰着自己，也安慰風雨中的行人：</p>
<p>「春雨就讓它落個不停吧，當春花還不全都開放的時候，爲什麼一定要去追蹤那軟軟的陽光呢？」</p>
<p>溪流</p>
<p>溪流永遠流得那麽愉快響亮，春水滿四澤，今日，它更期然的歌唱着了。匯合着涓滴的細流，成爲一支水溪，這是一個自然的大工程。</p>
<p>在冬天，溪床坦露了胸膛，溪流由桔竭而匯成了一支淙淙的泉水。那時，我像有一個年月可追懷的老人，沉落地坐在那跨溪而過的橋亭裏。我聽帶溪流瘦弱地流在寬大的溪床中，感到一份寂寞。如今春日，我再一次坐上橋亭，我却爲照滿的溪流所激勵，我能洞澈以往，想見未來，覺得生命越壯大是越有力量的。</p>
<p>連朝綿雨，一床春水，往日寂寞的活動變成了憤怒的奔騰，往日憂悒的歌唱也成了今日希望的歡呼了。</p>
<p>每天，我懷着一份希望打從溪邊走過，我像被鼓勵又像被啓示，我更理解一句話：</p>
<p>「不僅要有響亮的話，而且要有精密的知識。」</p>
<p>溪流似乎是懂得的，希望幻滅了以後，不是拋棄鬨走就完了的。生命除了時日的延績以外，還有求生的努力來充實的。</p>
<h3>畫室</h3>
<p>— 修拉</p>
<p>修拉（Goorgcs　Seural　1852-1891）本是巴黎印象派的畫家，因見莫奈（Monet）有時以點彩描畫，效果甚佳，他就進而專門硏究點描，與洗　克數人無形吻合，一八八六年以新面目的作品出現於印象派展覽會中，當時博得社會之好評，批評家即以「新印象派」和「點彩派」呼之。其特微，就是在全幅畫面上找不出一綫和一塊平塗的顏色，無論表現什麽都用點。作風新穎而纎麗，形式光暗尤其講究，色彩變化無窮，質量都表演得恰到好處。惜不永年——僅僅活了卅二歲，所留遺作不多。（獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　405</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「是呀，」鶴見忍不住揷口了，「我　奇怪，中國這們多人，腦筋比起日本人來，不知要靈敏多少，怎麽就不肯迎着時代去幹？……」</p>
<p>「豈是不肯？……就拿故敝莊這一二十個人來說，豈是沒有計劃，預備朝這條路上走？此外，還有許多大小集團，豈下也是凖備在幹？我們的政府，雖說腐敗了一點，難道其中就沒有腦筋淸楚的，用力　這一方面上苦幹？……可是你看日本，併吞了高　以來，肯讓中國好好地喘一口氣？限面前，政府剛剛把脚前掃刷乾淨了些，預備動手了……」</p>
<p>「是，我明白了，裏裏外外，總而言之，統而言之，就是不讓中國好起來！……是的，老大哥，我這回想要把那『七封秘緘』弄到手來，揭穿了牠，最終的目標，也是想消滅這次的戰爭。那麽，中國就有喘氣的機會了。政府如今是覺悟了，中國人民也就可以自由發展了；不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「瞧罷咧！」守一把下面的話吞下去了，他不願冲淡了鶴見的興致。</p>
<p>這兩位靑年，在這麼一位奇異的機緣上，團聚在一起，像這一類性質的談話；這個問題岔到那個問題上，這一句話，又引起了那一句話，這們撩下去，簡直可說三天三晚，也無法結束。好在他們談到興致正濃的當口，電話來了。</p>
<p>電話是剛才鶴見會見的那位韓人領袖打來的：他派了一位部下，給鶴見送消息來，關於萍子踪跡的——因所派的這人，與　見沒有見過面，爲妥當計，所以老人先打電話來知照一下：</p>
<p>「一共五十兩化學原料，現在才分析出來，　到了出產地和原料的種類，現在派人送來了，這位伙計雖說年經，倒是內行，請閣下花費幾分鐘，給他見見面。」</p>
<p>「五十」且鶴見與老人臨時約定的遞話隱語，「五點十分鐘，」一面指明打電話的準確時刻。「原料」是萍子失踪問題；「出產地」指對方背景；「種類」是失踪的性質，等等。老人原來是醫樂職業，所以應用本地風光，把消息遞過；局外人是無法猜疑的。</p>
<p>老人差派的部下剛到，正岩也帶着一個人同來。這人正是上萬歲館去我鶴見說語的那人。</p>
<p>「隊長」，正岩冲着鶴見行了一個規矩禮，前容上露出幾分高興的神色，「這是一位本地朋友，得到北平電訊，特爲找到隊長下宿地點，……」</p>
<p>「很好」，鶴見答應了正岩，立刻迎着來人，上前握手。</p>
<p>「滬特字二號，李明、上午十點收到北平總隊長電訊，部裏特派鄙人來參見，十二點已經上那邊去過一次，剛剛錯過，二點又去……」一口漂亮日語，這是受了正岩用日語說話的影響。</p>
<p>「失迎，失迎」。鶴見略一週旋介紹，請大家歸座。</p>
<h3>遙寄二章</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>蔚藍的天</p>
<p>十年以前，有一個時期，我曾瘋狂地愛過蔚藍的天。</p>
<p>我歡喜獨自倚在黄昏的窗口，聽微風劃破寂靜的長空，讓夜露洒上絳色的窗台。我睜着矇懂的眼睛向天望去。我欣賞星星，月亮，自雲，輕霧；可是使我嚴嘆神往的，是豐託在那些東西後面的一抺蔚藍的天。</p>
<p>我說：「月是姊，星是妹，飄約的白雲和迷濛的輕霧是些頑皮的小婢。祇有那一抹蔚藍的天，是一個充滿眞情擊愛的慈母！」</p>
<p>於是我像發狂一樣地到處　紫着蔚藍的天。</p>
<p>我從春天的池塘走到夏夜的庭園。我懷蔽了深秋的紅楓，迎待着寒冬的白雪。我倦了，躺在凄凉的河邊。我飢餓，摘下苦潔的果子充飢。然而啊！我祗是把長長的歲月埋葬在絕望的嘆息裏。</p>
<p>我痛哭嗎？我怨恨誰？是狂風，暴雨，驚雷；還是那密密的烏雲，遮住了我要搜索的蔚藍的天？</p>
<p>我不敢夢想奇　出現，不敢！早已不敢！</p>
<p>但是今天，吿訴你——</p>
<p>我終於笑了！因爲我的窗外，一個奇蹟，一抺美麗爍爛的蔚藍的天！</p>
<p>今天，我要做詩，做給你——蔚藍的天！</p>
<p>毋忘我</p>
<p>記得嗎？不久以前，在公園裏一塊寂靜的草地前，我指指地上一叢細小的藍色的小野花，吿訴你：「這些小花的名字呌——毋忘我！」</p>
<p>你笑了，側過頭來凝視着我，不語。</p>
<p>我猜不透你的意思，於是我又吿訴了你這個小小的故事：</p>
<p>我說從前有一個美麗的女郞帶着年輕的情侶來到海邊。海邊傾側的斜坡上，正開着許多藍色的小野花。那女郎呌她的情侶去把那些小花採下來，那情侶跨下斜坡，採了一束小花，正想回上岸來，不料突然海浪汹湧，他兩脚一滑，跌下斜坡，就被可怕浪濤捲入了無底的海裏。於是這苦命的女郞痛悔號啕。這可憐的情侶和這些藍色的小花，永世被人憶念，給牠題個名字爲「毋忘我」。……</p>
<p>你還是笑着，還是凝視着我，不語。</p>
<p>我突然虛心起來，倚着你，微微顫慄。</p>
<p>「是太無聊嗎？」我這樣想。</p>
<p>然而你終於開口了，你說：「這個故事是好的。」——</p>
<p>記得嗎？你曾這探說過，用着溫柔的聲音。</p>

<h3>音樂訪問團在迪化</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>在流行歌曲盛行的上海，好像是很少注意到正式的音樂。但是從另一方面看，也有很多人提倡着。像本市的國立音樂院，從下學期起增設幼年班，養成各種器樂的人才。市政府交響樂隊也積極地準備公開演奏。上海音樂協會（是本市音樂家組織的）主辦的中國音樂訪問團，最近尤其活躍。他們的代表先後到台灣，北平，天津，漢口等地訪問。最近隨同新疆有政府主席張治中將軍到迪化，在那裏的中蘇文化協會所主辦的音樂演奏會表演了十幾次之多。他們去的有馬恩宏（小提琴），吳樂繫（鋼琴），黄源尹（男高昔），陳麗淸（女高音），馬思蓀（鋼琴），管理人郁忻祖，他們得到當地熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>馬恩宏的小提琴，在中國樂壇上很有盛譽的。他自小就　葵艱深的樂曲，他並沒有因爲人家稱他神童，稱他是天才，而减少了他的進取心，他現在還不斷在努力。像這種天才與努力，眞是値得我們讚許的。</p>
<p>吳樂懿的鋼琴，她是中國鋼琴家中最出色的一位。以前在交響樂隊表演多次，受到中外人士的好評。</p>
<p>黄源尹，陳麗清的歌唱，也都有極高的成就。那位馬思蓀小姐，是隨同他的哥哥（馬恩宏）去伴奏的。</p>
<p>迪化各界人士因爲對他們太歡迎了，所以在臨別的時候，特地爲音訪團發起了一個盛大的音樂舞蹈會，那是各族文化團體組成的，有各種的舞蹈和音樂。在一個和平廣塲土露天表演，聽衆有三萬多人。烏，哈，塔，維，業各族人士全有。這次表演之後，昔訪團已經在一星期之前同到上海。他們預備等候那位在法國的周小燕小姐，（歌唱家）到了上海之後，再一同到美國去訪問</p>
<p>在中國音樂的萌芽時代，這音訪團足可以使我們興奮的。希望他們出國去帶些好的參考資料來。</p>
<h3>特別多</h3>
<p>— 恨月</p>
<p>寫着不准小使的地方，小便的人「特別多」。</p>
<p>寫着毋許招貼的牆上，招貼的紙「特別多」。</p>
<p>負有維護秩序的人員，不守秩序的人一特別多」。</p>
<h3>生活的保障</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>最近有兩位老先生離世長逝，一是政界人物，一是文化界人物，他們一生的經歷不同，可是他們之間却有一點是相同的，這就是報道他們死訊的消息上，最後都加一句按語，稱他們身後蕭條。</p>
<p>身後蕭條的程度自然未必一樣，可是它的涵敎總是說他們沒有多少遺產留下，旣不足以瞻養萋子，亦不足以敎育兒女。</p>
<p>人除了想對人羣有所貢獻以外，總還要顧到自己的生活，家人的生活，以及自己和妻子兒女將來的生活，所謂顧到將來，就是有遠慮的意思。然則那些身後蕭條的人們，都是沒有遠慮的人麽？未必。這裏眞用得着套一句古人的話：非無遠慮也，不得已也，這就是說，在我們這個社會裏面，生活缺少着保障。我們這個民族從來就生活在赤貧的邊緣，祗有少數人才能在平日有點積蓄，做到「積殺防　」的地步。大多數人唯有實行「養兒防老」，希望將來靠兒子的勞力來維持晚年的生活。倘然兒女尙未成年，或者無兒無女，或者兒女並不可靠，而老子已經一命嗚呼，那就難免落個蕭落的身後。這種情形戰前一向如此，戰後的今日便格外嚴重。</p>
<p>這身後蕭條乃是我們大多數人的憂慮，其實不但片後，連身前的現在，我們也有失業和疾病的憂慮。一且失業或疾病，我們的家庭就會發生與身後蕭條同樣的恐慌。這就呌做生活沒有保障，爲了求得這個保障，許多人都想掙得一筆遠過於他們僅能維持目前生存的錢財；在正當的道路上求之而不得，便挺而走險，幹出一切貪贓枉法的勾當，以至於做强盜作漢奸，無所不爲。</p>
<p>在富裕的國家（如美國）老百姓往往把政治的自由看得高於一切，在貧窮的國家，則老百姓對於生活的保障格外來得重視。一般人說貧窮是共產主義的溫牀，便是這個這理。戰後英國積極推行社會保險制度，也是這個道理。那末我們又將如何來爲大衆謀取這個生活的保陣呢？</p>
<h3>米蛀蟲的話</h3>
<p>— 李伯愼</p>
<p>米，只要一提起米這個字，三歲小孩子都曉得有個米蛀蟲，好比說起了奸人，大家都曉得有曹操和秦檜，所以今日之下米蛀蟲的厄運就可想而知。但是儘管人民駡他咒他，政府嚴厲取締決心抑平，米蛀蟲還不氣餒，仍幹着那種「一人利之萬人愁之」的職業，豈非太「寡廉鮮恥」。</p>
<p>每次米價漲一漲，政府就出來抑一抑，漲抑的結果總要比原來的價格高出許多，尤其在被認爲米在領導漲價的今日，政府仍不能澈底抑低米價，因而影響其他物價有漲無跌。我有一位遠房親戚，他是道地的米蛀蟲，我很想知道一些米的情形，所以抽一次空曾經去詳細問過他，據他說：</p>
<p>「米市面的漲跌，正和其他商業一樣，是常有的事，因爲商業上最　本的條件，在目前應該是貨物平衡率，像一疋布加人工的成本相等於市面上的售價，一本書一張椅……，都有它的平衡率存在，米蛀蟲做米生意，自也有這種認識，他們以一石米自產地運至上海，待銷售後仍到產地買進一石米爲原則，假如這探搬運一次能增加到一石以上，那自然就是全店職工所依賴的利潤，不像一疋布賣上市去，人工利潤等已計算在內；所以，即使上海米買十萬一石，或者五萬一石，他們只要在上海賣掉了米到產地補得進，都願意這樣做；而造成「居奇」的現象，無非因爲米蛀蟲要挨着產地價格便宜些時，上海銷售完了到產區補進同量以上的貨物。說也可憐，米蛀蟲自去年以來，那有一家能够好好地附合這個平衡率呢？</p>
<p>「現在政府對米蛀蟲抑平取締的原因，大槪是慕於幣値平衡率，所以認爲產地每石米十四萬，在上海售十六萬爲不合法，致於米以外的繳費及賣出後能否在產地補進，政府均沒有顧及。米蛀蟲爲什麼定要死認貨物平衡牽？不能尊重幣値平衡率？相信未蛀蟲以外的職業人民多有同感」。聽了這些話，不知大家將有怎探的感想？</p>
<p>（編者按：連日米價跳躍，米蛀蟲也有理由，姑爲刋出，且聽聽大家的意見）。</p>
<h3>推荐「裙帶風」</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>「裙帶風」是一齣三幕喜劇，內容描述，當今中國官僚政治中走內綫，利用裙帶關係這一套醜惡作風。劇本寫得相當樸素洗鍊，首先是人物關係與情節安排的簡潔；甚少節外生技的發展，其次是無諭在刻劇性格與叙寫對話的手法上，都用非常合暴的輕描淡寫，竭力避免露骨的筆觸，對於觀衆祗求「會心微笑」而沒有「隔靴搔痿」之感。</p>
<p>人物中有忠厚篤實的陳建南，熱愛精幹的好太太陳白琪，吹拍逢迎頗得寵信的馬力行，發辣横撥的馬太太，庸碌好色的鄧同，撒裙帶羅網的鄧太太，此外另有酸腐學究，庸俗市儈的安民民仲。</p>
<p>「裙帶風」這劇本對現實不無針砭，也是値得一覩爲快的諷刺喜劇。</p>
<h3>陪都風貌</h3>
<p>— 碧落</p>
<p>亘時半月之禁舞問題，頃已吿解決，揚子江，合衆，國際及重慶俱樂部四家皆以音樂廳招牌開業，盛况不减往昔。據悉：日間亦可舉行舞會，除週末及星期日有樂隊演奏外，平日以唱片播送音樂，茶資三千，咖啡牛奶四千。</p>
<p>本市防空洞在抗戰時建造頗多，現爲「物盡其用」起見，重慶行轅頃核定處理辦法四項：（一）靠近市區馬路之防空洞改建鋼骨水泥之停車房。（二）不堪使用者，以石條封閉，藉免危險。（三）大隊這在經費許可時，改設地下交通道。（四）私人防空洞斟酌情形，予以封閉。</p>
<p>北區幹路空地，頃經參議會議決收歸公有，改建公園，及圖書館，博物院，運動塲及游泳池。刻正由都市計劃委員會會同地政局辦理。</p>
<p>春江水漲，輪運較前暢通。作「復員」打算者，又形活躍。日來各大商店門口又出現「還鄉在即，减價拍賣」之紅條。</p>
<p>勝利紀功碑已興工數月，塔身刻已修達丈餘，終日工作緊張，行人莫不佇足而觀。又七星南通和平路之隧道，亦已大部竣工。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「緋緋，我吿訴你！」老祝只得放下了手內的舖蓋，凑過去笑嬉嬉的跟她說：「金阿姨他們坐的是小汽車，又舒服，又快，因爲裝不下多的人，所以你媽讓你一個人先走。金阿姨不是很歡喜你嗎？有她照呼你還怕什麽？到了重慶，你還可以先看見你的爸爸……！」</p>
<p>老祝　編劇本似的把所有的動聽的詞兒全用到了。果然，緋緋就停止了吵鬧，靜靜地聽着，顯然她的幼小的心露已給老祝所說動了，可是越往下說，效的態度倒又變了，她緊皺着兩道不太黑的　毛，直着眼，開始用心思索。</p>
<p>「這樣好那還是讓弟弟先跟他們走吧！」她仰着臉，像求吿似的說。小臉上透出天眞的忠誠。「弟弟小，吃不慣苦，聽該讓他走得舒服些……。爸爸最喜歡他，他先到重慶，爸爸一定會更高興的……！」</p>
<p>祝兆年聽這一個八歲不到的女孩子說出了這樣的話，心不由突然一酸，差一些就要哭。</p>
<p>而緋緋這一篇話也把蘭提醒了。她當然很明白自己家裏的事，胡覺文雖然是一個學者，可是舊思想也不能沒有，他確然是偏愛小榮的，因爲他是個男孩子！</p>
<p>「那就……」蘭　備改變自己的計劃。</p>
<p>「可是，緋緋，」老祝透着極嚴肅的神氣，再向緋緋說：「我們現在旁的車子還沒有，就是有，一定是卡車，比小包軍要苦得多，說不定還要走路，你大了媽媽又不能抱你，你受得住嗎？」</p>
<p>「我不怕的！我大了，我比弟弟强壯！」緋緋立刻回答，同時還把兩支胖胖的小胳膊向老祝揚了一揚。</p>
<p>「那就讓弟弟先走。」蘭作了一制　後的決定。「緋緋是乖的，我知道！」說着，她禁不住就伸手在緋緋的頭頂上很　　地撫了幾下。</p>
<p>小榮站在地上，仰着臉，一直在聽　們說話。（四）（四）</p>

<h3>中國通商銀行之沿革</h3>
<p>— 杜月笙</p>
<p>本行創立於前清光緒二十三年四月二十六日，爲已故盛宮保杏蓀先生一手創辦，維時國內已先有外商銀行之設立，盛宮保以鑒於欲富國必興商務，欲與商務首重銀行，發紓閎議，摺具奏章，奉旨招集商股，籌議創設，額定股本銀五百萬兩，設總行於上海，續於北平，天津，漢口，廣州，汕頭，煙台，鎭江等處設立分行，期收泉府機括血脈貫通之效。其識見之遠，彌足欽佩。此則我國之有銀行，當以本行爲　矢。顧以創辦之初，一切章程則模倣外商銀行，並延攬西人爲經理，藉資嚮導。越年又奏請敕下戶部通行各省關，凡存解官款，但係設有通商銀行之處，務須統交銀行收存匯解，未幾又發行銀兩銀元紙幣，以與外商銀行相角逐，以是循序經營，成效大著，而所有進用之西人至此亦皆陸續退職。迨至淸社旣屋，民國肇興，銀行之風氣大開，政府頒布修訂銀行註册章則及公司法，本行乃將原有章程從事修正，分呈財政實業兩部核准備案登記。時本行分支行處已遍設國內，及至民國二十三四年間，本埠金融業受世界金融風潮之襲擊，頗多岌岌自危，或竟因此而停業，或得維持而保全，政府以本行與四明中國實業等三行歷史較久，規模較宏，爰設法予以扶助。査本行股本原爲銀五百萬兩，自廢兩改元後折合國幣七百萬元，先收半數，計國幣三百五十萬元，事經股東會决議，加股減資，授權董事會向財政部接洽加入官股，以厚實力。經向財部洽商，奉令規定本行股本總額四百萬元，除將原有商股折計股本國幣五十二萬五千元外，由政府加入官股國幣三百四十七萬五千元，迄止二十七年抗戰軍興，戰區之京蘇錫杭四行首先撤退，成立戰區撤退行聯合辦事處於上海，比至烽火燎原，政府已遷都重慶，本人則先走香港，秉承國家抗戰大計，自不得不就本位努力，乃派駱淸華君馳往後方籌設重慶分行，本人亦接踵赴渝，相與籌畫。先是本行重慶分行成立前夕，適當國際戰局劇變，內外呼應隔絕，卒仍不變初衷，力排萬難，賡續進行，復親赴秦隴，以期開發內地寶藏，乃先後成立蘭州，西安，洛陽，寶鷄，平涼，天水，成都，自流井，威遠各行處，並爲完成西南北之金融聯繫，旋復設立衡陽，桂林兩分行，正擬逐步向東南展布，而中原與湘桂戰事同時爆發，因軍事之劇變，致洽陽街桂諸行處不得不隨軍撤退，而大後方之金融網差幸樹立，深感中樞管理機構，亟待內移加强，爰於三十二年六月呈准財政部將總行在滬機構撤銷，卽在重慶設立總行，以資督導。蓋所以奉行中央金融政策，配合農工鑛商建設計畫之全盤運　　用，俾期分肩一面抗戰一面建國之重大職責。顧承此戰時重慶分行一脈滋長，遂奠定本行再造復興之基，固屬仰承政府導敎有方，而社會各界對本行之倍加愛護，以及內外同人於抗戰過程中艱苦備嘗，一德一心，羣策羣力，完成使命，有足多者。在抗戰初期，本行陷區各行，均已先後撤滬，因遭敵僞刼持，業務無形停頓，三十四年八月日本請降，國土重光，本行奉令辦理收復區各行處接收淸理等事宜，本人因公先已抵滬，除遵照法令積極處理，同時並將上海分行及所屬滬區各支行公吿復業外，並以全國金融經濟重心業已東移，乃呈准財政部仍將總行遷滬治事，一面先行恢復京，甬，杭，錫，天津各分支行，並酌量撤併內地行處，再就通商口岸逐次復業。囘溯旣往，本行已屆五十週年，晦明風雨，世事紛更，念創業之維艱，感服務於未竟，而本行得有今日胥承各界加以愛護，敢不兢業經營，竭誠以赴，謹誌小言，撮其大略，用資紀念。</p>
<h3>五十年來中國金融之演進</h3>
<p>— 宋漢章</p>
<p>宋漢章先生服務銀行業達五十餘年，此次爲本行紀念冊撰述「五十年來中國金融之演進」一文，可謂親歷其境，極堪珍視。此篇係文之序論也。</p>
<p>—編者誌—</p>
<p>中國新式金融業之發靱以中國通商銀行爲嚆矢，創立迄今已有五十年歷史，本年四月適爲該行五十週年紀念之期，亦卽我國新式銀行成立五十週年紀念，鄙人在此五十年中，幸能始終忝與金融界工作，而以服務該行爲起點，計有十載，獲益良多，値茲紀念佳期，鄙人遵依該行函囑以「五十年來之中國金融」爲題，爰就所知略述五十年來我國金融界興革事項，以爲鑑往知來之借鏡。</p>
<p>金融事業爲一切經濟事業之中樞，猶人身血液循環，不可或停，有健全之金融組織，斯能促進經濟健全之發展，經濟健全發展，益促進金融事業之進步，兩者互爲依輔，未可偏廢。我國在五口通商以前，尙屬閉關時代，國內經濟祗求自給？旣無大規模生產，亦無新式金融機關之需要，昔之所謂金融機構者，僅有票號，錢莊，與典當而已，其作用祗在資金融通，本無與於經濟開發事業。自鴉片戰後，外人經濟勢力隨以俱來，英商麥加利銀行首先在滬設立分行，發行鈔票，扶助該國商人對華貿易，嗣後德、俄、法、美、日、荷、比各外商銀行，亦相繼續來華設立，以致我國金融大權全爲洋商銀行所操縱。迨民元以後，因國人自辦之銀行努力奮鬥，艱苦不拔，乃有今日偉大金融事業。撫今思昔，不禁有無限欣慰。茲略將我國金融機關演進經過分述如後。</p>
<p>我國金融機關之發靱，若就歷史而論，始於舊式之票號錢莊，其次爲外國銀行，始於一八五三年成立之麥加利銀行，而我國新式銀行之設立，則以光緒二十三年成立之中國通商銀行爲嚆矢。茲將淸末以迄民國十六年國民政府成立前發展情形一爲敍述。</p>

<p>票號錢莊爲我國之舊式金融業，其起源由於明未淸初，票號之設立，以山西幫票號爲最早，繼而有浙紹幫及合肥幫票號等等。山西幫因歷史悠久，資本雄厚，其總號多在山西，他如上海、廣東、瀋陽、漢口、重慶、濟南、西安、張家口等處，亦有分號，曩由各省　局傳現入京者，後均委託票號轉匯，各省藩署所徵收之錢糧釐金，以及各司道經收之關鹽兩稅，亦常分存各票號，故當時山西票號資金來源甚富，匯兌靈通，其後有浙紹幫之源豐潤，合肥幫之義善源等，見山西幫票號獲利甚厚，途亦挾其政治背景，應時而生。錢莊之設立，在滬以寧紹幫蘇州幫較具勢力，其次則爲鎭江幫。關於錢莊之起源，說者多謂由於我國幣制之複雜，昔時人民之制錢完納租稅，須照官價折合銀兩，轉折愈多，獲利愈厚，人民因轉折之故固有待於兌換店之設立，而兌換商遂亦爲時代所需要，今日之錢莊，蓋卽由此兌換店蛻化而成。就此二者而比較之，票號資本雄厚，信用較著，頗居優越之地位，錢莊資本雖小，然與一般社會頗相接近，故兩派勢力，均能增漲不已。惟山西幫之票號，重在保守，故步自封，浙皖幫票號接近官塲，交際圓滑，稍有不同。辛亥鼎革，國內金融頗有變化，票號首受震蕩，紛紛倒閉，錢莊亦一度衰落，經長期間之經營，始，稍稍恢復。</p>
<p>（乙）外商銀行</p>
<p>在我國境內之新式外商銀行，始於一八五三年成立之麥加利銀行，繼此而設立者爲匯豐銀行，東方匯理銀行，華俄道勝銀行，華比銀行，花旗銀行，横濱正金金行，台灣銀行，中法實業銀行，北洋保商銀行，中華匯業銀行，德華銀行等十餘家，此等銀行設立之初，其目的均在對華商業之經營，並通匯之便利，久之則兜攬我國政府借款，及對華實業投資，遂改其原來之目的。嗣後復因洋賠各款之關係，而關鹽各餘均須存貯外國銀行，以致金融財政均受其覊絆。</p>
<p>（丙）中國新式銀行</p>
<p>中國新式銀行，卽依歐西經營之方法而設立者，我國新式銀行之創立，以通商銀行爲嚆矢，當光緒二十三年，淸廷爲挽囘利權起見，乃招股設立該行，其時商股共計五百萬兩，先收半數，並命該行發行銀兩銀元兩種鈔幣，以便民間，蓋藉以抵制洋商銀行之紙幣。該行經始之際，以無法令成例可援，乃由董事會共同擬定章程，參酌泰西銀行成例辦法而益求謹嚴，並聘錢業領袖陳笙郊先生爲華經理，而以英人美德倫君爲洋經理，以溝通中外銀錢兩業，此爲我國創立新式商業銀行之動機。自中國通商銀行成立後之第九年，卽光緒三十年春，戶部奏准試辦銀行，以爲推行幣制之樞紐，定名爲戶部銀行，至光緒三十四年戶部改爲度支部，戶部銀行亦經奏准改名爲大淸銀行，頒佈大淸銀行則例二十四條，實具我國國家銀行之雛形。民國元年原擬以大淸銀行改名爲中國銀行，旋因政府主張重新組織，遂將大淸銀行停業淸理，另由財政部籌集股本，並制定中國銀行則例三十條，採取股份有限公司制度，蓋以官商合辦銀行而兼享有國家銀行之職權者。此外交通銀行之設立，則始於光緒三十三年十一月郵傳部奏准設立，擬定交通銀行章程三十八條，卽於翌年開辦，除經營普通銀行業務外，並有經理路、電、郵、航四政款項，及發行兌換券之特權。在民國十七年中央銀行未成立以前，中國銀行及該行同處於國家銀行之地位，至一般商業銀行繼中國通商而設立者，爲光緒三十四年之四明商業儲蓄銀行，民國以來新式商業銀行之設立者與年俱增，如民元卽有十四家銀行之新設，民三至民五年以政局多故，銀行之添設者較少，自民國六年以後方始漸多，民十年至民十二年歐戰方終，工商各業一時繁興，且政府公價亦整理就緒，在此三年中添設之銀行數達八十九家之多，民十五六年間全國各地有龐大之軍事行動，百業萎頓，銀行衰落，故十五年僅添設七家，十六年添設者僅二家而已。</p>
<p>此外關於中外金融業勢力之消長，亦頗有可述者。蓋我國金融市場向以上海爲中心，在此時期，國人自辦之銀行因自身努力之結果，已奠定根深蒂固之基礎，如存放發行等等業務，均能迅速進展，顯示良好之成績茲略舉如次</p>
<p>（一）當前淸末葉，上海外商銀行勢力極大，我國新式銀行尙寥寥無幾，且勢力薄弱，其能與外商銀行相匹敵者，則爲我國之錢莊。滬市通行銀兩，每日銀拆及洋釐均爲錢業所開出，銀行惟有聽其行市，然而錢莊資金之融通，亦常賴外商銀行之協助，卽所謂『拆票』，此項拆票，卽外商銀行拆與錢莊之短期借款，大抵以二日爲期，故該時之外國銀行，對於我國錢莊，似立於中央銀行之地位，後以橡皮風潮發生，錢莊之倒閉者不知凡幾，外商銀行以對於做出之拆票未能收囘，自後卽不願再做拆票，但自民國以來，我國銀行發達甚速，於是拆票由我國著名銀行做出者爲數甚多，此種接濟市面之責任，遂一轉而移之於我國銀行，由是我國銀行之勢力，遂得日益擴大，同時與錢業之關係，亦隨之密切。</p>
<p>（二）過去政府當局之擁有資財者，多以外國銀行爲最可靠，因此所有現款多爲其吸收，不意歐戰發生，日本攫取靑島，存於德華銀行之款，均未能提取，嗣後又有中法實業銀行之倒閉，由是我國上下人士，乃知外國銀行亦未盡可靠，紛紛將存款移存於華商銀行，當時之上海華商銀行，除中交兩行外，其著名者尙有中國通商銀行，浙江興業銀行，上海商業銀行，江浙地方銀行，金城銀行，鹽業銀行，中孚銀行等，皆能博得社會之信用，故其營業頗有蒸蒸日上之勢，其放款之安全，辦事之認眞，殆與英美之銀行無異，因此我國之銀行聲勢日隆，且復有我國銀行團爲中法代兌鈔票之舉，尤足增高我國銀行界之聲譽。</p>
<p>（三）往昔上海通行鈔票皆係洋商所發行，而以匯豐之鈔票爲最多，人民視之幾與現洋無異，後以中交兩行鈔票深得社會信仰，逐漸取外商銀行鈔票之地位而代之，推其致此之由，與民五年上海中國銀行繼續維持兌現有莫大之關係也。</p>

<h3>如何管理銀行信用</h3>
<p>— 戴銘禮</p>
<p>戴立庵司長爲本行紀念冊撰述「五十年來之中國幣制」一文，對於法幣政策尤闡揚盡至，本篇爲該文中之一節。</p>
<p>—編者誌—</p>
<p>抗戰以來，財政部嚴密管理商業銀行，一面在防止信用膨脹，取締投機囤積，協助平抑物價，一面在督導銀行資金投放於生產建設事業，曁產銷押匯增加貨物供應，更同時改進銀行制度，奠定金融基礎，其主要設施，略舉如下：</p>
<p>一、限制新銀行之設立　財政部爲嚴格管理起見，對於新設銀行限制甚嚴，其分阪行處之設立，以適應當地經濟需要爲標準，必於事先呈部核准，方得設立，務使其分散普遍，各地金融得以合理發展，抗戰勝利後，爲調劑收復區之金融經濟，特頒布收復區商業銀行復員辦法，仍根據各地實際需要，加以限制。</p>
<p>二、提繳存款準備金　商業銀行提繳法定存款準備金，由中央銀行集中收春，不特爲保陣存戶權益，及集中準備，而在戰時則更有緊縮商業銀行之信用，藉以協助平抑物價之功能。非常時期管理銀行暫行辦法規定商業銀行應以所收存款百分之二十爲準備金，轉存當地中中交農任何一行，四行專業化後，郎改由中央銀行集中收存。勝利後於『財政部管理銀行辦法』中改訂準備金爲活期存款百分之十至百分之二十，定期存款百分之七至百分之十五，其準備率由中央銀行就金融市場情形，商承財政部核定。</p>
<p>三、督導資金運用銀行運用資金，應以貸放生產建設事業爲原則，對於銀行直接經商囤貨或間接代客買賣貨物以及銀行服務人員利用行款經營商業，一律嚴厲取締，以澄淸銀行業務。</p>
<p>四、統一銀行會計科目財政部於三十一年十二月頒佈劃一銀行會計科目，共分銀行儲蓄信託三部，於三十二年度施行，此舉不僅對於銀行管理工作便利滋多，卽金融業務本身亦得有重大之改進。</p>
<p>五、推行票據我國信用制度尙在萌芽時期？票據行使尙不普遍，財政部爲促進金融建設，樹立現代化信用制度，於三十二年四月頒布非常時期票據承兌及貼現辦法，並指定國內各重要城市先後施行，一面會同中央銀行組織重貼現審核委員會，以管理重貼現業務，於是市場信用制度得以確立，而生產事業所需短期資金亦得有充分之供給</p>
<p>六、平抑市場利率　川省各地比期存放利率特高，且收付時期集中，金融業易受壓迫，財政部屢經籌議廢止，惟以商場習慣行之已久，因先制定比期存放款管制辦法，限制其最高利率，至三十二年一月乃實行廢除，由中央銀行改掛日拆，一面由財政部督飭各地銀錢業公會切實平抑市場利率，並求其長短期之合理化。</p>
<p>七、舉行檢査業務財政部爲考核各銀行是否遵行金融政策之規定起見，經卽指派人員分赴各地銀行舉行定期及不定期之檢查，以　核各銀行賬冊倉庫，並根據檢查結果，分別予以指示糾正，或依法處罰，其情節重大者勒令停業，藉以取締非法經營，而整肅銀行業務。</p>

<h3>吾國幣制之過程</h3>
<p>— 陳光甫</p>
<p>陳光甫先生爲本行紀念冊「五十年來之中國經濟」撰著「五十年來之金融」一文，長萬餘字，文彩典故，彌足珍貴，此文爲中之一節。　—編者誌—</p>
<p>吾國在昔民間通用銅錢，金銀元寶不常見於一般之交易，　外國銀圓流入漸多，民間以鑄造精細，業於使用，遂致流通地區日廣，清季政府自行鑄造銀幣，各省鼓鑄有重庫平一兩者，後卽專造庫平七錢二分，大小與鷹洋相若；惟以不肯官吏圖謀利益，含銀成分參差不一，某省鑄行者祇能流通於其本身政治勢力範圍，出境卽須貼水，以此之故，更增當時貨幣種類之繁複。</p>
<p>靑末民初之數十年間，其時貨幣之種類可舉於次：（一）銀兩中有上海規元，北京公祛，天津行化，漢口洋例，南京二七寶，各地不同其名，幾無從悉述其內容。（二）銀元中有西班牙之本洋，墨西哥之鷹洋，香港日本之銀幣，以及淸代所鑄之龍洋，而龍洋之龐雜，有江南、湖北、廣東、直隸、浙江、安徽、奉天、吉林、福建、四川各省，所造幣上鑄明所造之省名，成色則自九〇〇·三至八四三·五不等。（三）紙幣有各省官錢局或國營銀行省營銀行之銀元券，小洋券，銅錢票，以及各商業銀行之鈔票，甚至各地亦可發行私票。（四）輔幣有各種銅元，小洋，錁幣等項，故在民國二十二年三月十日廢兩爲元以前，實際上可謂無一定之本位幣。</p>
<p>吾國幣制之擬議。自淸光緒二十一年順天府尹胡燏之條陳開始，繼有盛宣懷於光緒二十二年改革幣制之奏請，光緒二十三年楊宣治仿造英鎊之秦，後有光緒二十九年總稅務司赫德採用金匯兌本位之條陳，胡維德採金本位之建議，以及光緒三十年美敎授精琦之金匯兌本位計劃，三十三年度以支部盧金本位辦法，宣統三年荷人銜斯林之金匯兌本位計劃，皆未見諸實行者。民國肇造三年二月公布國幣條例，通用銀本位，雖曹汝霖於七年八月呈請採用金本位，八年十一月張作霖倡議採用金本位，亦未果行。國民政府統一後，聘甘末爾設計委員會草具逐漸採行金本位幣制法案後，於是關稅改徵金單位，發行關金券，使關稅組保之外債及賠款不至發行鎊虧，又先行統一銀幣，以確立本位。二十二年三月廢兩爲元，公布銀本位幣鑄造條例，由是我國幣制逐漸統一於銀元。</p>
<p>當我國統一銀元本位之時，美國因維持銀價發生收買白銀之計劃，引起我國銀元銀條之外流，於是通貨日見緊縮，物價步落，商人之存貨，工業之出品，皆不能敷其成本，恐慌之機已露，雖政府施行銀價平衡稅，以阻止白銀之出口，然日本在華北一帶公然走私，白銀流出益多，當時工商業倒閉迭見，金融經濟岌岌可危，英國目覩此狀，爲欲維持對華貿易及列强在遠東之均勢，誠恐我國在日本逐步進逼之侵略下再有金融之崩潰，特派李滋羅斯來華助我於二十四年十一月四日完成法幣制度，宣布白銀爲國有，美國續與我訂立白銀協定，使法幣保有外匯準備，益臻堅强。</p>
<p>法幣在國內不兌現，可按法價向中央銀行無限制買賣外匯，每元合英金一先令二便士半，此項法幣卽爲中央中國交通三銀行所發行之鈔票，後又加入中國農民銀行之鈔票，至其他商業銀行已有發行，均移轉於法幣發行，至此我幣制卽由銀本位一躍而爲金匯兌本位，從此脫離金貴銀賤或銀貴金賤之波動。</p>
<p>法幣之所以能於成功，第一當時在華洋商銀行中原以英籍銀行最具權威，英國政旣府助我成立法幣，故在華之洋商銀行皆予接受，卽日本銀行亦無阻撓，故極順利；其共一卽中國交通以及通商銀行所發鈔票，經長時期之流通信用彰著，民間使用已成習慣，不復兌取現銀，是以流通普及於偏鄕僻壤，數量亦漸見其增，準備金所保有之銀元，亦更爲豐厚，此頃鈔票已先具備法幣之條件，爲民間所信賴，不似各省軍閥之濫發停兌，搖動經濟基礎，貽害人民。法幣有此重要因素，故改行之初，民間旣無不便，亦不懷疑，而留在民間之銀元，隨卽漸爲政府所收集，此不能不歸功於主辦各該行者多年來之措置得當，維護有方也。</p>
<p>所惜法幣成立不及一載，卽遭遇日本之對我全面侵略，而我國不能不出於長期抗戰，說者謂抗戰之成在於法幣，倘無法幣則抗戰必更爲艱難。法幣之發行在戰時已由四行集中於中央銀行，法幣之對外匯價，在戰時由無限制供給外匯改爲請核外，復因當時敵僞之套取，改爲平準基金以及管理外匯，與美金之比率自三元三角演變以有今日一萬二千元之掛牌，法幣之對內物價已相差近一萬倍，多數人民受累甚重，生活日艱，倘國內政治能以安定，國際收支能謀平衡，國家預算歲出與歲入可以符合，則法幣價値得臻穩定，使民生漸次蘇復，實爲當前金融之總關鍵。</p>
<h3>五十年來　銀行業數量上之進展</h3>
<p>— 楊蔭溥</p>
<p>楊石湧先生爲本行五十週紀念冊「五十年來之中國經濟」撰著「五十年來之中國銀行業」一文，長二萬，此文爲其中之一節。　—編者誌—</p>
<p>五十年來銀行業於數量上之進展頗爲明顯，茲劃分爲（一）前淸季年，（二）抗戰以前，（三）抗戰期中，及（四）復員初期四時期述之。前淸時期計自光緒二十二年至宣統三年共十有四年，抗戰以前時期計自民國元年至『七七』事變共二十五年餘，抗戰時期計自民國二十六年至三十四年秋共八年有零，復員初期則自三十四年九月起以迄於今。</p>
<p>（甲）前淸季年進展情形中國通商銀行奏准設立於光緒二十二年，自後八九年間銀行初無成立，迨光緒三十一年春戶部銀行成立後，始年有新銀行之出現。總計自光緒二十二年至宣統三年之十四年中，先後創設銀行共十有七家，蓋是時社會經濟環境對新式銀行之需要尙未見迫切，同時票號及錢莊滿佈各地，營業極爲發達，外商銀行更挾其經濟勢力盤踞於通都大埠，在在予新興銀行以無形之阻力，淸季最後之六七年間，成立銀行達十有六家之多，在當時環境之下，實已屬極形蓬勃之現象。</p>
<p>（乙）抗戰以前進展情形民國肇興，政治一新，工商業感受刺激，生機驟動，銀行之設立亦轉趨活躍。民元一年中新創銀行卽達十四案之多，其後年有創設，迄十六年止銀行創設者共一百八十五家，其中以民國六年至十二年之七年中景况尤爲繁榮，新創銀行達一百三十一家。蓋當時適値歐戰，外貨來源阻塞，國內工商業有長足之進展，資金調節之需要增加，增設銀行因有必然之勢。益以北京政府大舉內債，助成當時大批北方銀行之興起，是爲我國銀行業之初度蓬勃。自後數年，因國內有龐大之軍事行動，工商業一部停頓，銀行業亦入蕭條境地，同時更受北京政府財政崩潰之牽累，危機日益深刻，銀行倒閉之風日熾，此種局面至民國十六年國府奠都南京後方漸見改善。</p>
<p>自民十七年以降，同政治之漸趨正軌與經濟建設之漸見端倪，於工商業欣欣向榮中銀行業亦隨以開展。十七年份新創之銀行卽達十五家。是年十一月中央銀行成立，同時對中交兩行亦有合理之調整，金融局面一新，銀行創設日見增加，而倒閉則漸趨減少。自十七年至廿四年間創設銀行凡一百二十四家，在此期內，一方國內逢「九一八」及「二八」二次之事變，一方國外受美國白銀政策及世界經濟恐慌之影響，中國經濟危殆異常，銀行業幸能勉强支持者，實賴其本身之能自立更生，早樹較健全之基礎。民國二十四年十一月法幣政策實施，使全國經濟恢復繁榮，銀行業之基礎益形穩定，此後二年間新設銀行雖不蓬勃，但銀行業根基日固，已有蒸一蒸日上之象。</p>
<p>截至民國二十五年六月底止，全國創設銀行共計三百三十家，先後倒閉者達一百六十六家，當時存在者爲一百六十四家，分支機構設立遍及全國，當時亦已達一千三百三十二單位，茲將二十五年六月底歷年銀行開設情形列表於後：</p>
<p>光緒二十二年以來銀行歷年開設家數統計表</p>
<p>材料來源：二十五年全國銀行年鑑</p>
<p>二十五年下半年內又有銀行一家新創，二十六年上半年又有三家新創，但因同時銀行有停業者，故截至二十六年上半年止銀行總數仍爲一百六十四家，分支機構則已擴展爲一千六百二十七家。</p>
<p>當時所存銀行以商業銀行爲最多，自十七年以後各省紛設省銀行，農工銀行亦　茲將二十五年六月底止存在有增設，但所佔比例甚少，之銀行分類列表於後：民國二十五年六月底全國銀行分類統計表</p>
<p>材料來源：二十五年全國銀行年鑑</p>
<p>二十五年下期至二十六年抗戰發生前夕，情况並無顯著變更，祇商業銀行減少七家，農工銀行增加五家，省市及華僑銀行各增加一家。</p>
<p>（丙）抗戰期中進展情形「七七」抗戰，變起倉卒，淞滬又値戰場，金融中樞遭受打擊，銀行業重陷困境，所幸當局措置得宜，恐慌之期爲時甚短。戰後一二年間卽因產業繁榮而使銀行業重趨蓬勃，一時新銀行之設立，如雨後弈筍，尤以大後方之情形爲然。據統計自二十六年『七七』事變時起至三十一年八月底止，五年內新設銀行卽達一百零八家之多，其中仍以商業銀行爲最多，佔六十二家，次爲省市縣立銀行佔十九家，農工銀行十五家，專業銀行九家。此後戰事雖屢有推移，銀行增設仍方興未艾，截至卅四年八月底勝利前夕，後方銀行總數已達四百十五家，視戰前全國數字增加頗多，分支機構則爲二千五百六十六所，亦較前增加，而活動地區則僅及戰前之半，由此可見戰時銀行業興盛之一斑。茲就三十四年八月底止全國銀行之分類數量列表於後</p>
<p>民國三十四年八月底全國銀行分類統計表</p>
<p>材料來源：中央銀行金融機構業務檢査處統計</p>
<p>就上表以觀，値得注意者爲國營行局及省營銀行分支機構之激增，以及縣市銀行之增設，具見當時政府對調整金融機構及開發國民經濟之努力。</p>
<p>至於淪陷地區，除原有商業銀行類多繼續經營外，數量亦有進展，新設銀行中由敵偽創立者有五大機構，一爲偽「華興銀行」，總行設上海；一爲僞「中央儲備銀行」，總行設南京；一爲僞「中國聯合準備銀行」，總行設北平；一爲僞「蒙疆銀行」，總行設張家口；一爲偽「滿洲國中央銀行」，總行設長春。至一般商業銀行亦大有增加，卽以上海一地而論，勝利前夕總數竟達一百九十三家，已較戰前增加達三倍以上。此一百九十三家中，除一部份係戰前開設，及三十餘家新銀行係於三十一年太平洋戰事發生前向國民政府註册設立者外，其餘新設之一百二十餘家，均未經政府核准，勝利來臨，卽奉命淸理，當時上海之銀行卽減爲七十三家。</p>
<p>（丁）復員初期進展情形抗戰勝利結束，銀行業承戰時之繁榮，數量仍繼續增加，而其增加之比例更較過去任何時期爲高。此等銀行之增設，大抵均爲應環境之需要，蓋抗戰勝利，陷區光復，各地銀行業務自有迅速展開之必要，故截至三十五年十二月止全國銀行總數已達五百七十四家，較一年前勝利時又增加一百五十八家，較戰前則已增加四百十家，分行爲二千九百九十六家，較一年前增加四百四十家，較戰前則增加一千三百六十九家。茲將三十五年十二月底全國所有銀行分類表列於后：</p>
<p>三十五年底全國銀行分類統計表</p>
<p>材料來源：三十五年中央銀行稽核處統計</p>
<p>由上表所列，可知勝利年餘以還國營行局之分支機構已略見減少，此原爲正常之現象，蓋勝利復員，戰時四佈於大後方之人民陸績還鄕，分支機構因情勢改變，自有予以合理調整之必要。再就省營驟市營銀行言，數量仍見增加，如與戰前相較，省營銀行之分行已增加七百三十三處，至於縣市銀行原爲戰時新興之制度，戰前甚少發展，據中央銀行三十十二年度之統計，截至二十六年上半年止，以農民銀行農村銀行地方銀行等名義存在之縣銀行，全國總計爲數僅祗二十六家，今則已增爲三百五十六家。</p>
<p>銀行宇數之增加，原不足以正確表示銀行業之進展程度，然銀行業於數量上之增加多少表示當時經濟社會及工商業對金融調節之需要，卽多少表示銀有業實力之發展。</p>

<h3>吾國交通所受外力壓迫回顧</h3>
<p>— 葉恭綽</p>
<p>榮譽虎先生爲本行紀念冊撰述「五十年來中國之交通」一文，長萬餘言，撫今追昔，感慨甚多，此篇僅爲其中之一節耳。</p>
<p>—編者誌—</p>
<p>我國現代交通之建置，可謂全部受外力之支配，此由於近百年來中國之國際地位僅亞於殖民地，原因固爲自造，事實無待諱言。西方之近代文明，非中國習俗所易接受，數千年閉關之後，一旦海通，中國與列强接觸之下，國力之貧且弱，豁然顯露，乃猶積習難返，罔圖革新。淞滬鐵道英人築之，而我自毁之；開平煤礦之唐胥線，雖建自光緒七年，而由津榆展延以成之；京奉路則構通於光緒三十三年，蓋後於辛丑條約且七載，故在當時我國之物質建設，與他國較，彼之進步愈速，我之落後益甚。以是較量，國力貧富强弱之距離，自亦相去日遠，外每日深，勢所必然。凌逼旣甚，乃求自新，窮變之理，豈所謂殷憂啓聖者乎。自後京漢、津浦、滬寧、正太、京綏、隴海、吉長、粵漢等幹線，次第興建，訖乎抗戰前夕，除東北地區淪陷不計外，國內路線總長乃達一寓一千四百餘公里，衡諸彼時環境，進步不爲不速。惟除京綏一線，完全由本國專家以本國資金修築外，其餘在第一次歐戰以前所建各路，十九僉賴舉借外債雇用客卿以成。夫利用外資，借用楚材，爲適應需要，原非惡例，惟其運用之權必須操諸我手，庶幾有利無害，而在當日情形，殊非若是。蓋由於外交上所謂門戶開放機會均等之說，英、法、德、日諸强，爭雄逐利，憑藉不平等條約之挾制，形成所謂勢力範圍之局勢，各就所便，取得投資建築營業之權，卽小弱如荷蘭，比利時，亦競謀染指，路權一經讓與，卽建築某路必向某國借資，不獨我方不得改就他國，卽他國亦不得强分杯羹，而在擁有路權之國，對於實際興建之遲速，亦惟其利便是視。迨借款旣立，工程經始，則工師由其派遣，器材由其供輸，卜築旣成，則運輸由其經營，利潤由其享有，我國雖派任管理之首長，大都垂拱畫諾而已，必待債務償淸，路權贖囘之後，乃得自主營運，而在償贖之際，條件苛刻，固不待言，以是京奉滬寧之資借自英，京漢之資借自比，咸其例也。津浦一線，乃截裂爲二，蓋其南段通滬寧，故借英款，而北段近靑島聯膠濟，故由德人承辦，迨歐戰旣起，日軍據膠澳，此津浦北段亦隨膠濟路而入日人掌握，中國之鐵道乃隨國際戰爭之勝負，而成爲授受繼承之財產，撫今追昔，專無悲愓。第一次歐戰及俄羅斯革命，使歐西各國無暇過問遠東之事，俄國亦不遑東顧，其能保持中東路之權益，蓋亦幸矣。美國則尙在墨守門羅主義時代，鮮與世界爭雄，雖參歐戰，旣勝卽退，對於中國僅作和平商戰，不存侵略野心，用使友誼得以久持，而日本則因利乘便，益逞霸亞之志　　，藉英日同盟之蔭，以南滿路爲根據，蠶食東三省經濟利益，更進而問鼎華北，浸尋而釀成九一八事變，是固國際局勢使然，而我國內政之多故，坐失時機，未能樹立健全之經濟基礎，影響及於交通之積極發展，殊未可盡諉其過於他人也。中國旣爲歐戰協約之國，在巴黎拒簽和約，國際地位不無稍增，自九國公約簽訂及我國民政府成立之後，國內思想旣漸進化，國際視我目光亦新，以言路權之贖囘，舉正太爲例，我人以合理堅强之態度，終能駁斥苛刻條件，順利接收，至爲興建新路而舉借外債，雖於債息之高，料價之昻，不無有所損失，而於主要權利，已能打破前此之惡例，在抗戰以前十年之間，雖云未能事事盡如人意，在舊路之整理，與夫新路之營建，固不能謂無相當之成就矣。</p>
<p>五十年來之鐵道建設，如上所述，足以窺見其所受外交影響之一斑，由此而遭受之損失與苦痛，蓋已至鉅。若夫水上航運，則更以一言蔽之，曰：航權之喪失，使中國整個航業有若孩提之童，病癆入骨，根本無由滋長矣。電報水線亦曾大權旁落，幾費周折，僅慶收囘，前途發展，尙待努力。郵政事業，向爲外人主持，在水陸交通簡陋之情勢下，乃能聯合採用新式與舊式運輸工具，規劃業務，樹立制度，俾於抗戰之初，全國郵局達七萬二千之數，郵路達五十八萬四千餘公里（當時已淪陷之東北地區未計）。溯自光緒二十二年創辦之始，爲時蓋不過三十餘年，比自國人自辦以後，乃能循厥成規，逐漸發展，使中華郵政，可以媲美先進國家，客卿之有造於我者，惟此一端，粗吿無罪。至若公路及航空交通，則爲新興事業，其所受國際影響尙淺，於此姑不備論。</p>
<p>時至今日，經歷第二次世界大戰，在昔日之列强中，德意志與日本已先後喪敗，今日之列强，方將共策所以銷泯其侵略思想。中國旣與世界民主國家並肩作戰，共禦暴力，已往所受條約之束縛，號稱解除，諸大盟友，不論其思想趨向之爲左爲右，今且競以民主主義相號召，若果言行一致，開誠相見，互信互讓，以謀和平，則世界安全，可有保障，我國建設前途，宜現光明。顧自大戰吿終，瞬將兩載，國家疆土，雖云光復舊觀，引領北望，隱憂尙深放順大連，屢聞接收之說，而事實朱覩，長春鐵道，形成共管，瞻彼東北，吾土吾民，吾疆吾理，事勢所趨，是否果能一洗往迹，氣象更新，未易言也。至謂各項不利條約，悉已廢除，新約訂立，標榜互患，原則確定，固云可慶，按其實際，相去幾何？飛機輪舶，我往彼來，彼機來矣，我舟安在！文書圖籍，以啓民智，新學奇技，亟待灌輸，足以益人者我尙未有，而我之所需求者，不得複印，則源泉梗矣，寧非我人所謂現象容有不同，性質初無二致者哉。自立自强，能無省惕。顧在友邦，當此軸心崩潰之後，興亡之鑑，寧能漠然無動於中。夫優勝劣敗，强存弱減，誠似至理，然論全球民族，狡勇莫如日，强毅莫如德，益以體力之健，智慧之銳，宜乎稱雄一世，史太林格勒與珍珠港之役，以爲可以宰制天下矣，乃不數年而瀕於滅亡。自後則印度印尼且繼菲律濱而獨立自主矣，究其理似有不可思議者在，豈非以生存與自由爲人類之基本權利非可以暴力强奪者歟。我人於二十五年前曾有言曰：『吾國之能否不爲巴爾幹，其運命惟我國能自决之，故吾國自己能爭得一口氣，乃爲世界造無窮之福，否則所謂太平洋問題，遠東問題，形形色色皆將發生無數轇轕，雖流無量之血，而尙不能解决，反是者吾國而能確自樹立，門戶棣通，工商輻輳，各國所享利益，或反遠勝今茲，世界之平和，亦庶幾克以永保。』近觀國際爭競之烈，斯言似尙未失時效，故對國內固渴望國人之能愼思明辨，努力自新，對外則願世界友邦之領導階級，能具遠大目光，本利他卽利己之精神，合作互助，保持世界和平，同享人羣福利，不僅爲中國經濟之繁榮與交通之發達所利賴也。</p>
<h3>五十年來對外貿易之趨勢</h3>
<p>— 壽景偉</p>
<p>壽毅成博士爲本行紀念冊撰述「五十年來之中國國際貿易」一文，材料豐富，分析詳盡，此篇爲該文之緒論。　—編者註—</p>
<p>我國五十年來對外貿易之趨勢，可分五個時期述之。</p>
<p>一、自一八九五年至一九一三年，爲關稅主櫂喪失，國際爭取市場時期。本期中不論進口貿易或出口貿易，其增加率均甚大，出口貿易由一億四千萬關兩，增至四億關兩，增加率爲百分之一八六。進口貿易由一億七千萬關兩，增至五億七千萬關兩，增加率爲百分之二三五。本期對外貿易之激增，原因有二。（第一）各國依照一八九五年馬關條約取得在華設廠便利，故英法諸國之對華投資爲數激增，同時本期修築鐵路最盛，民族工業方在草創，故對於外貨之需要甚猛。（第二）本期通商口岸由二十四處增至四十八處。特別是由於一九〇五年日俄戰爭之結果，東北成爲我國新開之重要貿易市場。東北之農產品出口大增。而日本在中國之貿易上亦遂漸佔優勢。</p>
<p>二、自一九一四年第一次世界大戰開始，至一九三一年東北事變發生，爲民族工業萌芽，貿易向外推展時期。本期中國對外貿易續呈扶搖直上之勢，出口貿易由四億關兩，增至九億關兩，增加率爲百分之一二五，進口貿易由四億五千萬關兩，增至十四億三千萬關兩，增加率爲百分之二一七。關稅自主權之恢復，尤爲國民政府成立後之一大成功。</p>
<p>三、自一九三在二年東北淪陷，至一九三七年對日抗戰爆發，爲農村經濟恐慌，出口貿易銳減時期。本期中一方面由於世界各地經濟恐慌，生產力減退，我國農村經濟日趨窮困。人民購買力薄弱，進口遂受影響。另一方面由於東北失陷，喪失重要出口地域，輸出乃力趨減退。</p>
<p>四、自「九三八年至一九四五年，爲戰時貿易統制，試辦國營貿易時期。在此時期中，我國對外貿易入於戰時狀態，故對外貿易數字，實至微而不足稱道。惟在貿易政策之積極實施，則有劃時代之意義。政府對國際貿易方面，完成基本實施，組織貿易委員會。建立行政機構，制定外銷貨物統購統銷辦法。先後設置富華貿易公司，復興商業公司。復經部令將中國茶葉公司及世界貿易公司，劃歸經營，統籌易貨購料事宜。倡行國營貿易制度，乃其中之犖犖大者。另一方面，英美於一九四三年與我簽訂新約，放棄在華所享治外法權及其他權益，歷來加諸我國國民經濟之桎梏，由是解除。此於發展戰後對外貿易自有密切關係</p>
<p>五、一九四六年以後，則爲籌劃戰後貿易調整時期。此爲抗戰勝利後之第一年。對外戰爭，雖已終止，而國內和平，則尙未完全實現，如言出口貿易，則以交通困難，內地農產無法運至口岸，利率過高，成本尤昂，貨物難以推銷，農業因國內戰事關係，多遭毀壞，出口農產數量亦形減少。如言進口貿易，則與民族工業競爭性之民生用品，如紙及棉花等項，進口數字特多。而奢侈品之走私運入，尤形猖獗。瞻念前途，杷憂曷極。茲將五十年來進出口貿易價値列表於後：</p>
<p>五十年來進出口貿易價値統計表（以百萬爲單位）</p>
<p>註：一九三五年一九四六年係國幣數字。</p>
<p>折美金係按當時關兩或國幣與美金比價折合，一九四六年係按三三五〇比一折合。</p>
<p>一九四一年至一火四四年全國進出口數字囚海關未發表，無從列入。</p>

<h3>今後吾國財政之展望</h3>
<p>— 賈士毅</p>
<p>賈果柏先生爲本行所編「五十年來之中國經濟」紀念册撰述「五十年來之中國財政」一文，長一萬五千字，材料豐富，分析詳盡，本篇爲該文之結論。</p>
<p>—編者誌—</p>
<p>財政上最高目的，厥爲牧支之平衡，欲求收支平衡，則不得不講求理財之道，所謂理財之道，不外開源節流，其理雖淺，而如何實行，則頗費斟酌。戰時期中，一方消耗增多，一方生產減少，財政收支失其平衡，理有必然，挹注之策，我政府曾竭盡心力，從事種種措施，而大部份實有賴於發行。所幸中國爲農業國家，戰時後方，年年豐收，通貨縱有膨脹，仍能渡過最黑暗之時期。勝利後，因國內政局尙未安定，致財政收支，仍難平衡，除繼續增發通貨外，其他財政措施自不能步上常軌，然而如謂中國財政已吿絕望，則似非持平之論，茲就管見所及，略申梗概如左：</p>
<p>（一）關於收入方面</p>
<p>甲、日本之賠償我國爲首先被日侵略之國家，且亦受害最深，故日本賠款，我國理應佔有巨大比例，並應享有優先權利。此項賠款，爲數幾何，目前雖尙未可知，但其數目之鉅，必遠超於在國內沒收敵僞產業之所値，而此項賠償，事實上，雖多屬生產設備，然我國當前最大之困難，旣仍爲物資之缺乏，如獲有龐大之新式生產設備，則加緊生產，卽可解决物資缺乏問題，間接卽可減輕財政上之負擔。此其一。</p>
<p>乙、國營事業之出售三十六年二月十七日經濟緊急措施辦法中，卽有出售國營事業之擬定。原夫國營事業，本有範圍，苟以財政原因而擴大國營事業之範圍，財政收入雖有增益，實不敵經濟方面之損失；而經濟爲財政之命脈，如經濟凋敝，財政亦將步上萎縮之途。故國營事業之出售，在財政上不獨爲一大筆收入，而於整個國民經濟亦將發生良好之影響。發展國民經濟，增强人民納稅能力，實爲開闢財原最穩妥之途徑。此其二。</p>
<p>丙、直接我之擴大徵收　直接稅爲良稅，經濟先進諸國，多列爲國家最重要之收入。我國直接稅自開辦以來，雖年有增收，然因所包範圍不廣，卽以所得稅而論，亦僅分類徵收，復以調査統計尙未詳盡，故去理想之途尙遠。直接稅旣爲今後吾國之重要稅牧，如能切實辦理，擴大徵收，財政收支之平衡，必蒙莫大之裨助。此其三。</p>
<p>丁、交通事業之盈餘交通事業之盈餘，原爲吾國歲入上重要之一項。自抗戰以來，爲安定物價起見，交通事業之售價，多在成本以下，非予貼補，幾難維持，故交通事業之在目前，不獨無補於國庫，且爲財政上之重大負擔，然此種情形，究爲一時現象，他日全國重要鐵路幹線完成，沿線經濟，大量開發，交通事業之收入，仍爲國家極可靠之財源。此其四。</p>
<p>戊、易貨之所得盱衡大勢，國際間貿易之完全自由，尙非短期間可能實現，而我國原爲工業落後國家，復遭戰爭之慘重損失，對於貿易之管理，仍將予以賡續，除進口限制外，關於我國特產，自應由政府集中收購輸出，直接固在增多外匯之收入，間接卽所以挹注財政之支出。此其五。</p>
<p>（二）關於支出方面</p>
<p>甲、裁撤不必要之機關　戰時期中，由於環境需要，中央與地方增加機關甚多。戰事結束後，雖有裁撤，而尙保留者仍屬不少，不獨影響行政效率，且增多國家支出，而人才集中於都市，更不利於鄕鎭之發展，此後凡不必要之機關，應一律裁撤，藉節國帑。</p>
<p>乙、停辦不必要之事業　除裁撤不必要之機關外，其次當爲停辦不必要之事業。平心而論，政府舉辦事業，經過鎭密考慮者固多，而狙於環境奉行故事者，亦屬不少，此必構成財政上之浪費，際茲國家財政百孔千瘡之時，所有不必要之事業，應澈底停辦。</p>
<p>丙、其他不應由國庫負擔之支出應停止支出，此類支出，無論公開與否，均應由國庫支出中剔除。</p>
<p>（三）關於財政政策之運用方面</p>
<p>甲、財政政策與經濟政策之配合財政不能脫離經濟，夫人而知之，故今後財政，在收入方面，切忌竭澤而漁，斵喪稅源；在支出方面，直接間接應用之於生產之途，使租稅效果成爲再生產性。</p>
<p>乙、財政政策與社會政策之配合「取之於民，用之於民」，本爲財政上最早之理論，然以近代觀點衡之，此種理論，尙不能謂爲完備，必也，取之於民，應依平等原則，用之於民，應依普遍原則，限制財產集中，使無貧富懸殊之隔，提高生活水準，躋大衆於康樂之境，財政政策運用之道，卽在矣是。</p>
<h3>五十年來之中國保險業</h3>
<p>— 五效文</p>
<p>王效文先生為本行紀念册撰著「五十年來之中國保險業」一文，內容豐富，文章典雅，此爲乃其序論也。——編者誌——</p>
<p>王道之始，在使民養生送死而無憾，孟子言之於二千數百餘年以前，泊保險之制度興，斯王道之蹊徑闢，人生有涯，世事無常，惟能於未盡之年，作善後之計，則醫藥喪葬有所取資，孤獨鰥寡不至無吿，此人身保險之足以送死而無憾也。惟能於安樂之時，爲顛危之備，則刀兵水火，綢繆牗戶，取諸外府，復興可期，此損失保險之足以養生而無憾也。付至微之代價，獲萬金之保障，就被保險人而言，則保險固社會福利事業也。保險者，非保證危險之必發生，亦非保證危險之必不發生，僅保證所保之標的發生危險時所遭受之經濟損失，予以相當之賠償云爾。或然之率（Laws　of　Probability），原非必然，集民間之游資，增钜額之資本，投資建設，足以富國。孔子曰『百姓足，君熟與不足。』則保險事業之發達，實國家資本充實之元河。就保險業而言，保險之有關國家經濟，實至深且遠，當今之世，以資本之雄厚稱者，莫如英美保險事業，英國實爲先進，迄今仍執世界水火保險之牛耳，美國之人壽保險事業則佔世界百分之七十以上，至以新制度爲全球所注視者，又莫如蘇俄，蘇俄保險制度之範圍較各資本主義國家爲尤廣，於此益見保險事業非爲追求利潤之資本主義組織，而爲扶助社會事業，壇進社會健康？力保人羣幸福，輔翼經濟建設之機關。囘顧我國又何如耶？斯五十年來，中國保險菜之不可一加檢討，鑑往知來，或者足爲推進之一助　。</p>
<p>我國古時有無所謂保險制度，書閥有間，未敢附會以逞臆。據其可考者而言之，則我國之有保險業，實始於百餘年以前淸道光十五年（西元一八三五年）香港之友寧保險公司（Union　Insurance　Society　of　Canton　Ltd.），及翌年之廣東保險公司（Canton　Insurance　Office,Ltd.），厥爲嚆矢。所可惜者，兩公司皆爲英商之所經營，國人於保險事業之觀念，蓋慒如也。道光二十年（西元一八四三年），南京條約成立，上海，廣州，寧波，廈門，福州五口，同時闢爲商埠，英商勢力日增，上海市况亦漸繁盛，道光二十六年（西元一八四六年）英商遂設永福（Standard），大東方（Oriental）兩公司於上海，以營人壽保險。同治元年（西元一八六二年）復設保家（North　China）揚子（Yangtse）兩公司，以營水火保險，華商亦未能起與爭衡。我國之有保險業殆始於光緒十一年（西元一八八五年）之仁和、濟和、兩保險公司（今併爲仁濟和保險公司），爲華商自營水火保險之椎輪。然距友寧之設爲時已五十年，卽吾華保險事業之遭外商龔斷者，亦五十年，此第一屆之五十年，中國實無保險之足資記述，良可慨也。</p>
<p>竊嘗論之，積貧如我國，非利用外資不足以致富强，然利用外人資本於生產事業則可，國民資本而爲外人利用則斷乎不可，外人投資生產事業則可以助我建設，興我國家，國民資本而爲外人利用，則結果適得其反耳。保險事業所吸牧者，均爲民間財富，設使悉由外人經營，則此僅有之民力，幾何不隨海舶乘桴而去，我國家雖欲不爲繫於芭桑之嘆不可得也。光緒十一年（西元一八八五年）以後，我國有識之士蓋有見於此矣，自光緒十一年（西元一八八五年（以迄中華民國二十四年（四元一九三五年）此五十年間，華商對於保險事業之開拓抉植，以求與外商相抗衡，實已竭其所能。茲就此第二屆五十年中華商歷年所設立之保險公司列表如下：</p>
<p>依右統計，則我國保險公司在第二屆五十年中設立者凡五十有三，停業者計十三，截至民國二十四年止（西元一九三六年）現存者爲數四十。茲再就其性質及分佈情形列表如次：</p>
<p>（甲）組織性質</p>
<p>（乙）地域分佈（以總公司所在地爲準）</p>
<p>更就外商保臉業而言，依民國二十四年底統計總公司在上海者六，在香港者亦六，分公司及代理機關則爲數甚多。茲依國籍，將所有外國保險業在我國有總分公司及代理機關者統計如下：</p>
<p>國別總數</p>
<p>英國　七六</p>
<p>美國　二三</p>
<p>日本　一四</p>
<p>德國　九</p>
<p>法國　八</p>
<p>荷國　一一</p>
<p>澳洲　四</p>
<p>加拿大　三</p>
<p>瑞士　二</p>
<p>意大利　二</p>
<p>挪威　一</p>
<p>丹麥　一</p>
<p>印度　一</p>
<p>菲律濱　一</p>
<p>烏拉圭　一</p>
<p>東印度　一</p>
<p>總計其數一百五十有七，以與華商相較，猶覺彼衆我寡，國人對於保險業之努力，雖似奠初基，而爲山九仞，雖覆一簣，固未容略有懈弛也。</p>
<h3>如何運用公債政策</h3>
<p>— 陳炳章</p>
<p>公債司長陳炳章先生為本行紀念册撰述「五十年來中國之公債」一文，長萬餘言，內容豐富，統計詳實，為彌堪珍視之紀實文字。此篇所載，係該文之結論也。</p>
<p>—編者誌—</p>
<p>檢討五十年來我國公債政策之概况及其成就，爲策勵將來，對於今後應如何加强運用以發揮公債政策，自有加以客覜研討之必要，茲不揣譾陋，分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）配合國家財政經濟政策戰時籌措戰費之主要來源，不外增稅募債及增加發行，其中以增發通貨最爲危險。年來因通貨膨脹，物價高漲，以致民不聊生，工商凋敝，故今後彌補財政不足，應運用公債政策，不應專恃增加發行，尤應配合國家之經濟政策。經濟政策是使人民富裕，所謂藏富於民，然後財政自有來源，此係治本之道，眞正開源之方也。</p>
<p>（二）建立政府債信　政府發行公債，原爲補助政府之不足，取之於民，用之於民，然其幾微之點，在一「信」字，如政府措置失信於民，發行公債必難推銷，舉借外債，更屬難能，故抗戰以前，財政當局以建立債信爲號召，舉借債務，順利推進，未始非明智之措施。今後政府應下定决心，與民更始，逐步設法恢復信譽。</p>
<p>（三）改善募債辦法發行公債，應向民間籌募，以期直接吸收人民儲蓄，如交行抵押墊款，無異增加通貨，殊失發行公債之意義。十六年國府成立之後，各種公債大都仍係採取抵押方式，抗戰期中雖經採向民間普遍募集辦法，但因種種阻礙，募集未收宏效，而攤派方式，尤多流弊，致使人民嘖有煩言。今後應一面避免銀行抵押，一面改善直向人民推銷辦法，務求普遍公開，培養人民自由認購之習慣，而切實達到吸收社會游資之目的。</p>
<p>（四）樹立公債市場　公債爲有價證券之一種，依照原理，應使自由流通。抗戰期間金融重心移至後方，而證券市場並未具備，以致債券未能公開自由交易。上年九月，上海證券交易所雖經復業，然戰後金融未臻穩定，上海市塲尤多畸形發展，公債上市頗費斟酌，將來市場局勢好轉，政府似應酌定時間，令准公債上市開拍，以樹立公開市場，藉以調劑金融。</p>
<p>（五）確定舉債原則及用途舉借外債應以平等患互不損害國家權益爲基原本則，其用途應以經濟建設，尤以實業計劃中所定之各項事業經費爲限。內債之用途，亦應有明確規定，並由民意機關監督之，並確定財政部爲統一借債之經辦機關，方足以收運用及控制之效。過去各部會因本身業務上之需要，各自向外國接洽借款，以致步驟紛亂，不能兼顧，以後舉借外債，應以財政部爲唯一經辦機關。</p>
<p>（六）建立對外借款之整個計劃總理實業計劃內所列應辦之事甚多，不能同時並舉，應分別先後、緩急，其中何者宜先，何者可後，宜有一整個之計劃，由各需要物資之事業機關，造具事業計劃書及所需物資種類數量表，呈由行政院彙集編整個計劃核定，以後卽按照計劃，交由財政部會同事業機關分別向國外洽借配撥</p>
<p>（七）借款用途之　　及其財務上之控制　過去外債之失敗，多由用途之下　實及財務之浪費，以致事業無成，償還無着，國計民生，交受其敝。總理之實業計劃如付諸實施，需用浩　，對於各械事業所借外債用途之稽核，及其平時財務支出之控制，自非採取嚴密之措施不爲功，此種辦法，應由各主管機關與財政部及有關機關組織監理財務機構，實行勾稽出納之職責，並以取得業務之聯繫。</p>
<p>以上所舉，實爲公債政策之要圖，若本此政策而舉債，以之鼓勵儲蓄，吸收泌資，促進建設，增加生產，穩定金副，平衡預算，調劑對外貿易，改善人民生活，則人盡其財，物盡其用，地盡其藏，貨暢其流，由是財源日開，國用恆足，公債政策之運用，對於我國財政經濟之建設，其關係誠非淺鮮也。</p>

<p>前言</p>
<p>中國通商銀行自創立迄今，已有五十年之歷史。關於此五十年間之興革史略，杜董事長月笙先生已另有文記其大概，茲再略述其近况。</p>
<p>組織系統</p>
<p>本行組織系統，名義上稱總行制，實際係總管理處制度，其目的在採取兩者之優點，而除去其劣點，自試行以來，收效頗宏。茲將本行內部組織系統列表如左：</p>
<p>按照廿四年財政部規定，本行計有官股董事七名，商股董事四名；又官服監事三名，商股監事二名，合共董監事十六名。現任董監事爲：</p>
<p>分支機構</p>
<p>本行前在盛宣懷先生主持時期，分支行處機構不僅分佈全國，且遠達新嘉坡及香港等地。後因主持人經營不當，業務不振，僅及於東南一隅。自民國廿四年杜董事長接任以來，勵精圖治，已有中興氣象，預期在短期內，不難恢復舊觀。茲將總分支行處現在分佈狀况及其負責人列表如左：</p>
<p>人事制度</p>
<p>本行自復員後，全力推進業務，特於去夏公開招考員生，加以訓練。其目的在充實行員知識技能，提高服務道德，養成健全幹部。考試結果，計錄取六十人，分兩期訓練，第一期業已結業，分發任用；第二期正在訓練中。</p>
<p>訓練方式分爲左列三項：</p>
<p>甲、實習　受訓員生依照實際需要，派往各實習行處，在營業時間內秉承各行處主管指導，在各股輪流實習，以期對下列各項工作活動獲一概念：一、文書股（1）收發（2）擬稿（3）繕校（4）檔案；二、會計股（1）抄報（2）記總帳（3）記聯行帳及匡計頭寸（4）覆核（5）軋帳；三、營業股（1）存款（2）放款（3）匯劃（4）交換（5）匯兌（6）同業；四、出納股（1）收款（2）付款；五、儲信股。</p>

<p>業務槪況</p>
<p>戰事勝利結束後，國內外金融經濟現勢，瞬已展開新的一頁。由於戰時非常環境所造成之非常金融經濟病態，一時未易廓淸，前途荊棘，亟待克服。現空前之經濟在瀾，正挾隨勝利以俱來，全國工商金融各業，風雨震撼，岌岌然不可終日！本行幸本過去服務社會悠久歷史，暨年來所受時代孕育新神，尙能綢繆未雨，應付機先，努力奮鬥。</p>
<p>茲將勝利以來本行業務概况分述如下：</p>
<p>一、存款　戰時經濟，每多特殊病態，一般存戶心理，大都改觀，游資多不透過銀行。本行恪守立塲，存款吸收，一本正常，不與黑市競爭，主要對策，厥從樹立信用及提高服務效率方面推進，存款數字，尙能保持相當水準。歐戰吿終時，卽切實對存款準備加强充實，並充分儲備現鈔，靜候應付，故當黄金風潮，及勝利後存戶提存諸端，均能肆應從容，未受影饗，且各行處存款，反見增加。上海並因代兌僞幣關係，轉存亦多。至儲蓄存款，以戰後民生凋敝，吸收匪易，但爲倡導節約，依舊舉辦，而牧效不著。</p>
<p>二、放款　年來工鑛生產日趨萎縮，商業資本，膨脹過速，投機囤積之風，變本加厲，各業用款，已無所謂季節性，銀錢業貸放對象，漸失憑籍。本行放款，在合法與安全之條件下，仍以短期靈話並緊縮信用，側重質押，客戶力求分散，押品貴易脫售，尤以可資轉抵押及轉貼現者爲要。例如自流井之鹽塊，威遠之煤斤，西北特產之羊毛，皮張，藥村，水菸等，與國計民生有關各業，多致力匡扶。年前時局急轉直下，本行戒備於先，將放款緊縮，收囘舊欠各戶。故雖當市面告迫，銀錢業焦困萬狀之際，不致臨事周章，所需頭寸均由總渝兩行充分調應，並未向各地中央銀行拆借款項，此可說明本行資金之運用，力求審愼。至勝利後，市面未復常態，同業多存觀望，本行仍擇信用素著各戶，酌予貸放，藉免暗耗。</p>
<p>三、匯款本行對匯兌，銳意經營，所有調抵頭寸，如現金輸送買匯運用，均盡力以赴，並委託各地同業，訂立代理收介合約，積極拓展通匯網。自勝利復員，滬地物價與內地相差懸殊，一時資金東流，本行爭取時機，首向各商業銀行辦理申匯，客戶稱便，所獲匯水盈餘，差足抵補因戰事結束後，收縮放款及復員費用之損失。</p>
<p>四、損益關於上年度損益情形，收益方面，以利息爲大宗，開支則因物價繼續上漲，僅勝利初期，稍呈穩定，而復員費用，又佔支出大部，幸能力事撙節，不致隕越，年終决算，尙勉有盈益。</p>

<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Taiyuan, on the 25th] The second session of the first Shanxi Provincial Assembly opened at 9:00 AM on the 25th. Chairman Yan Xishan delivered a speech, hoping to guide the people, cultivate a democratic spirit, assist the government, complete local autonomy, and lay the foundation for constitutional government. The assembly passed a resolution stating that counties in southern Shanxi, such as Xinjiang, Yicheng, and Quwo, have been successively occupied by communist forces, who are taking advantage of the opportunity to establish a base and plunging the people into misery, requesting the central government to quickly send a large army to recover them.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 24th] Official sources have learned that the communist military plan is divided into three stages: (1) To gather troops and launch a multi-pronged attack, completely controlling Shanxi; (2) To use Shanxi as a base to connect the Northwest and Northeast routes; (3) To finally launch a full-scale offensive.

<h3>Chu Xichun to Go to Nanjing Soon, National Army Currently Controls Eight Counties in Northern Yan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 25th] Chu Xichun, Commander of the 11th Pacification Zone of the Zhangjiakou Pacification Headquarters, came to Beiping a few days ago and will go to Nanjing for training soon. Chu stated: (1) The communist forces have not yet taken active action to attack Datong. The National Army currently controls eight of the thirteen counties in northern Yan, with only Pinglu, Hunyuan, Lingqiu, Shuoxian, and Shanyin counties in the hands of the communist forces. Approximately 30,000 to 50,000 communist soldiers from northern Shaanxi have crossed the river into Shanxi. (2) The National Army launched an offensive in northern Shanxi a month ago, advancing to Zuoyun and Youyu, and the southern Sui area and Kouquan Coal Mine have been secured.

<h3>Ling Hongxun Discusses Domestic Transportation Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Shanghai] Ling Hongxun, Vice Minister of Transportation, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last. He was originally scheduled to fly to Beiping yesterday afternoon with Sa Fujun, Director of the Department of Roads, and Chen Yanjiong, Chairman of the China Changchun Railway, to inspect the transportation situation in the Northeast. However, due to poor weather, the departure was temporarily postponed. When asked by reporters about the general situation of domestic transportation, he stated that the main railways in the country that have returned to normal operation include the Beijing-Shanghai, Guangdong-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou (southern section), Longhai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Beining, and China Changchun Railway (southern section). Among them, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have the most developed business, while the Guangdong-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai railways are more difficult. The vehicles used are all old ones from the past, which have been repaired and put into use, unlike the two railway bureaus that have new cars available. The operating situation is also such that only the two railway bureaus have surpluses. As for the rumors that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will be double-tracked, the Ministry of Transportation has not yet considered this issue. Regarding the two derailments that occurred successively on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the Ministry has already ordered the responsible parties of the two railway bureaus to quickly prepare a report and submit it to the Ministry of Transportation for review in order to clarify the issue of responsibility. As for the establishment of railway business offices by the two railway bureaus, Ling believes that it does not conflict much with the business of forwarding agents, but can instead complement each other and promote the smooth flow of freight. Therefore, the Ministry of Transportation has given earnest advice to the forwarding agents who petitioned in Nanjing against the establishment of railway business offices by the railway bureaus, hoping that they can coexist peacefully and work together to improve freight operations. Regarding civil aviation, much remains to be done in China to improve it and seek development.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Visits Wuxi for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 25th] Sun Ke will travel to Wuxi for a spring outing with Chen Ce, Sun Jiulu, and others at 8:00 AM on the 26th, and will return to Nanjing in the coming days.</p>
<h3>US Department of Agriculture's Far East Director Praises the Administration of the Shaanxi Recovered Areas, The Times Praises Our New Government</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Xi'an, on the 25th] Provincial Chairman Zhu recently received a letter from Dr. Muir, Director of the Far East Division of the Foreign Agriculture Service of the US Department of Agriculture, expressing great admiration for the administrative measures in the recovered areas of northern Shaanxi. He believes that improving the welfare of the people in the recovered areas and winning their trust are necessary steps to completely resolve the communist problem.</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, London, on the 25th] The Times today published an editorial examining the prospects of the pro-government forces in China. It briefly stated that the new government's policy is both liberal and active. This policy includes a thorough reform of local government, the protection of personal freedom and freedom of speech. If this policy can remedy the various mistakes of the past, it will certainly win the support of all good people, and it can also show the communists that the welfare of the people can only be promoted through cooperation under the new constitution.</p>
<h3>Three New Ministries Being Organized, to be Established After Legislative Procedures are Completed, The Organization of the Ministry of National Defense to be Streamlined</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 25th] Although the organizations of the three newly established ministries of Land Administration, Water Conservancy, and Health in the Executive Yuan each have their own scale, there is no precedent to follow. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has yesterday ordered each of the newly appointed ministers to prepare the organizational law and budget for their respective ministries, which can be announced upon completion of the legislative process by the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 25th] The newly appointed Minister of Health, Zhou Yi-chuan, traveled from Nanjing to Shanghai by military aircraft at around 3:00 PM on the 25th. Zhou is still working in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. It is also reported that Yan Shenyu and Yao Kefang have been internally appointed as the Permanent and Administrative Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 25th] The Political Consultative Council and the Legislative Yuan have successively suggested to the government that the organization of the Ministry of National Defense is too large and should be adjusted and simplified to save costs and increase efficiency. It is reported that the authorities are paying close attention to this suggestion and have ordered the Ministry of National Defense to begin streamlining.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 25th] Wang Yunwu gathered the staff of the Ministry of Economic Affairs at 3:00 PM on the 25th to bid farewell, expressing his deep appreciation for the past work of all the staff and hoping that they would continue to serve with peace of mind and work hard for national reconstruction.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 25th] Minister of Economic Affairs Zhu Yunwu is instructing his staff to expedite the handover. Wang Yunwu is no longer working at the ministry. Both the Permanent and Administrative Vice Ministers have resigned, and the Secretariat has sent a telegram to Li to urge him to take over.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Information Bureau to be Established on May 1st</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 25th] The Executive Yuan Information Bureau is scheduled to be officially established on May 1st and will continue to work at the current location of the Central Propaganda Department. The organization of the Central Propaganda Department will be reduced in size, and it will temporarily share the same location as the Information Bureau before Ta-hsün arrives.</p>
<h3>This Year's Work of the Ministry of Water Conservancy Will Focus on Farmland Irrigation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 25th] After the Water Conservancy Commission was reorganized into the Ministry of Water Conservancy, Xue Dubi, who has been in charge of water conservancy for many years, was appointed as the Minister. During his tenure at the Water Conservancy Commission, Xue completed a great deal of work, especially the recent completion of the Hukou Dam, which marked a new era in history. This reporter recently visited Xue to ask for a brief introduction to the future organization of the Ministry of Water Conservancy. It has already been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan, pending completion of legislative procedures by the Legislative Yuan before it can be officially assumed. As for the various divisions and sections under the ministry, they will be similar to ordinary departments. The technical institutions established will include the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, the Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, and the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, which are the reorganized Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commissions established by the former commission. The candidates for bureau chiefs are also the former chairmen of the committees of each bureau. Furthermore, Shen Baixian, the current deputy chairman, has been internally appointed as the Vice Minister of the ministry. The original nine members of the commission have been dismissed due to changes in the system. The ministry building is under construction and is expected to be completed by July of this year. Xue also told reporters that the key points of this year's work will focus on the following two points: (1) River repair and protection, especially the Yangtze River and Pearl River, to prevent major floods. (2) The development of farmland irrigation. 37 districts in Gansu, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Fujian, Guizhou, and other provinces are carrying out unfinished work, and the government has been requested to allocate 20 billion yuan to handle it.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, on the 25th] The handover between the old and new chairmen of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is scheduled for the first of next month. The new chairman, Liu Weizhi, previously served as the Minister of Overseas Affairs and is very familiar with overseas Chinese affairs. The former chairman, Chen Shuren, has served in the commission since April 16, 1932, for more than fifteen years. Chen's contribution to consolidating the foundation of the commission and developing overseas Chinese education has been significant.</p>
<h3>Anti-Mao Movement Increasingly Fierce Among Communists, "Armed Struggle Causes Calamity for the People"</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, on the 25th] After the National Army recovered Yan'an, the anti-Mao movement among the communists has become increasingly fierce, as evidenced by the communist anti-Mao propaganda materials recently seized by the National Army at the front. This propaganda material is signed "China Communist Party Extraordinary Committee, Soviet Lu-Wan Border Region Party Committee," and one of its slogans is "Fighting a civil war is a dead end, peaceful unification is a path to survival." The second is "Reorganize the current government, expand the democratic foundation." The third is "Uphold peace, oppose division." There is also an illustration depicting Mao Zedong and the countless bones under his feet, with the inscription "The Mao faction's armed struggle to seize power brings disaster to the people. To have a peaceful and happy life, everyone must work together to oppose him." Other anti-Mao leaflets include: "Oppose Mao Zedong's armed struggle to seize power" and "Oppose using the people as cannon fodder."</p>
<h3>Far East Economic Conference Opens on the 9th, Yan Renjie Arrives in Shanghai, Guo Taiqi Exchanges Views with Lie</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] George J. Janccko, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Information Department and Director of the Preparatory Office of the United Nations Far East Information and Propaganda Division, accompanied by Zhu Baoxian, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office, arrived in Shanghai last night at 7:30 PM by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane after transferring from the United States to Manila via Hong Kong.

<p>After Yan disembarked, he was accompanied by Director Chen to the Cathay Hotel to rest. He told reporters that he had been ordered by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to come to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of the United Nations Far East Information and Propaganda Division and to prepare for the Asian and Far East Economic Commission meeting to be held here on June 9th.</p>
<p>The Economic Commission meeting to be held will be attended by ten countries including China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, Australia, India, the Philippines, and Siam, with a total of thirty-five representatives, and is scheduled to last ten days. The focus of the meeting is to discuss (1) rebuilding the economy of Asia and the Far East, raising the economic level of Asia and the Far East, and maintaining and strengthening economic relations between the member states and other countries; (2) investigating and studying the economic and technical problems and development status of each country; and (3) collecting economic and technical statistical information from each country.

The second session is scheduled to be held here in November of this year.</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of the United Nations Far East Information and Propaganda Division, Yan hopes to find an address in about a week, to begin work. The task of the division is to provide the public, the press, schools, and various group units with various information about the United Nations. This information will be released in Chinese in the future. At the same time, criticisms of the United Nations from all walks of life in China and newspaper reviews will be sent to New York for reference. The division will require approximately 40 employees, a portion of whom will come from New York and are expected to arrive at the beginning of next month. In addition to Shanghai, the United Nations Information and Propaganda Division has also been established in London, Paris, Copenhagen, Geneva, and other places. Moscow will also be established soon. After the economic conference is over, Yan will go to New Delhi to expand the already established division there, and then go to Cairo, Prague, and other places to prepare for establishment. After he leaves China, the official director of the Far East Division will be dispatched by the United Nations from New York.</p>

<h3>Returning After Being Detained for Eight Weeks, Two Military Officers Much Thinner</h3>
<p>[Report from the United Press, Communist-Nationalist Front Line on the Songhua River, on the 24th] At 0:32 PM on the 24th, in an isolated, dilapidated house on the plain 100 yards north of the Songhua River, the two US Embassy Army Deputy Attachés who had been captured for 55 days were released by the Communist Army. They were Major Rigg (34 years old) and Captain Collins (25 years old). The two were captured on March 1 while visiting the front line 17 miles northeast of Changchun, and have only now been freed. Their health is normal, but they are much thinner than before, with four days of unshaven beards and pale complexions, the result of being imprisoned in Harbin for eight weeks. The first to come forward to welcome them were Mr. Kleiber, the US Consul General in Changchun, and his assistant Gu Wen. Mr. Kleiber and his party walked half a mile with a white flag, through a thicket of bushes devastated by landmines, to reach their destination. At that time, there were still 20 armed communists guarding around Rigg and Collins. Mr. Kroupa stepped forward to greet them, and after a brief formality with the communist members, the group returned to the vicinity of the bridgehead position guarded by the National Army on the north bank, crossed the river by ferry, and met with Mr. Surls, the Army Attaché sent by the Nanjing Embassy. After exchanging pleasantries with the welcoming party, Rigg and Collins boasted about the souvenirs they had obtained during their adventure. Rigg showed a small silver plate, which he bought in Harbin on March 19 while being escorted by the Communist Army. Collins showed a bottle of 30-year-old brandy that he had bought.</p>
<h3>US Embassy Welcoming Party Waits on the Banks of the Songhua River</h3>
<p>After being detained, Rigg and Collins were taken to Harbin for detention, where they were treated not badly, with Western meals provided twice a day. Two days later, they were allowed to exercise outdoors. The hardest part of the detention period was being completely isolated from outside news and not having the opportunity to shower or shave. On March 22, the communist authorities notified them that they could be released. On the same day, they were led by communist personnel and departed south, spending two nights on the way. On the third morning, they were escorted by armed guards on horseback or on foot.</p>
<p>The US Embassy Welcoming Party Waits on the Banks of the Songhua River</p>
<p>Rigg and Collins both rode on horseback, dismounted at the red house, and walked to the banks of the Songhua River, where they met the US welcoming party. However, Mr. Surls, the Army Attaché of the US Embassy, Mr. Zulna, the Air Force Attaché, and Captain Jin, the aide-de-camp of Sun Liren, Commander of the New First Army, climbed to a high point on the south bank and watched the drama on the communist side of the river through binoculars. Seeing that the handover was clear, they launched a boat close to the north bank to welcome Rigg and Collins safely across the river. At that time, it was very quiet within 500 yards around, with only thousands of ducks in the river flowing downstream and birds flying against the wind in the sky. They were very disappointed when they arrived on the south bank and did not see any Chinese reporters on the scene. Mr. Surls and his party will stay in Changchun tonight and be hosted by Commander Sun, and will fly to Nanjing tomorrow morning on a C-47 aircraft. Collins' wife is heavily pregnant and is waiting in Nanjing, and her first child is due on May 3.</p>
<h3>Two Detained American Military Officers Did Not Participate in Military Activities</h3>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, Washington, on the 25th] A State Department spokesman announced that Major Rigg and Captain Collins, the US military officers who were recently captured by the Communist Army, did not participate in military activities and were only observing National Army operations as observers. Well-informed sources also pointed out that the rumor that "the two military officers signed a statement admitting to spying on Communist Army positions" is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>[Report from the US Information Service, Nanjing, on the 25th] The US Embassy announced on the morning of the 25th that Ambassador Stuart's original intention to officially visit Hankou has been abandoned due to the recent poor weather. He intends to schedule a visit to Hankou after mid-May.</p>

<h3>Huo Baoshu Reports to the Political Council: Overview of Relief Efforts in the Past Year, This Year's Expenses Require Over One Trillion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] The Resident Committee of the National Political Council held its 21st meeting at 9 AM on the 25th, inviting Huo Baoshu, Director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to attend and report on the overview of relief and rehabilitation efforts in the past year. Huo first reported on the organizational overview of UNRRA and CNRRA, then reported on the work of CNRRA in the past year, divided into two parts: relief and rehabilitation, and listed figures to illustrate. It is said that as of now, more than 1.8 million tons of materials from UNRRA have arrived in China, with another 7-800,000 tons to be transported by land. The original plan was to stop the transportation of materials to China by the end of June, but now the purchase date has been extended to the end of May. Approximately in August or September, the materials from the United States can all be transported, while the materials from the United Kingdom and Australia will not be fully transported until next year. Huo then reported on CNRRA's financial situation, stating that CNRRA's finances were very difficult last year, but are better this year. Last year, the government allocated more than 20 billion yuan, but the Sichuan expenses were more than 270 billion yuan, which was made up by borrowing more than 90 billion yuan and selling materials for more than 160 billion yuan. This year, if all work plans are completed, it is estimated that more than one trillion yuan will be needed. However, the government's allocation this year is only 560 billion yuan, and the shortfall can only be offset by selling materials. He also stated that CNRRA is a temporary organization, and all future work is being expedited, with plans to complete it in three phases: March, August, and November. All unfinished and continuously maintained businesses will be transferred to permanent agencies for management. Huo finally reported in detail on the relief and engineering work in the Communist-controlled areas and the Yellow River flooded areas, and answered many questions from Fu Sinian, Xue Mingjian, Zheng Kuiyi, Wu Chunwu, Fan Yusui, Luo Heng, Xi Zhenduo, Yin Shuxian, Qian Gonglai, etc., regarding the sale of relief materials, the distribution of materials, and the relief work in western Yunnan and Shandong, which lasted three hours. The meeting then proceeded to discuss proposals, and passed the proposal submitted by Wang Baoxuan and others requesting the government to quickly provide relief to the refugees in northern Jiangsu. It was resolved to send it to the government for prompt handling. It was also learned that during today's meeting, Yin Shuxian and others suggested amending Article 15 of the National Government Organization Law to add that the Chairman of the National Government should be responsible to the people of the whole country or to the representative body. After discussion, most political councilors believed that this was unnecessary, and the chairman put it to a vote, which was not passed.</p>

<h3>Chen Yi Cables Urgently: Wei Daoming to Take Up New Post at the Beginning of the Month, Candidates for Various Departments in Taiwan Can Be Announced Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to relevant sources: The candidates for the heads of various departments of the Taiwan Provincial Government are expected to be approved at the Executive Yuan's weekly meeting next week. Wei Daoming will go to Taiwan to take up his new post at the beginning of next month. The authorities believe that Taiwan Province has just undergone changes and the people's hearts are uneasy, so they are extremely cautious in selecting the responsible personnel. They have been carefully studying with Minister Bai, who went to Taiwan to inspect, especially the new provincial chairman. Therefore, they are paying more attention to the position of garrison commander, and have not yet made a final decision. Chen Yi decided to leave Taiwan after completing the handover and has sent a cable to the new chairman urging him to go to Taiwan as soon as possible. Regarding Chen's future whereabouts, there are many rumors. According to qualified sources, the position of Director of the Chongqing Executive Headquarters is the most likely, but it can only be decided after Chen arrives in the capital.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] Wei Daoming stated to relevant parties on the 25th that because he had never been to Taiwan, he is now reviewing past administrative measures. Therefore, it is still difficult to announce the administrative policy for Taiwan Province for the time being. However, those who are inappropriate in the past measures will be eliminated, and the connection with local people will be strengthened to achieve "cooperation between officials and people." The cultural, economic, legal, and other standards of the people of Taiwan Province are relatively high, and it should not be difficult to achieve the level of a model province. As for the adjustment of personnel, it will be based on talent, not limited to provincial origin. As for the rumors that another deputy director will be set up and filled by local people, it is not true. Wei also expressed his willingness to go to Taiwan as soon as possible. In addition, seven groups of people from Taiwan who are traveling in Nanjing and Shanghai elected seven representatives, including Yang Zhaojia and Zhang Bangjie, to meet with Wei on the afternoon of the 25th and submitted a letter of opinions on governing Taiwan. Wei agreed to consider it and hoped that they would assist in cooperation. It is also heard that Wei will go to Shanghai on the 27th.</p>

<h3>Over a Thousand Japanese Factories Designated for Reparations: Our Claim: Maintain Japan's Industrial Level at the 1930 Level</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th dispatch] The reporter has learned that 1,015 factories have been designated for reparations. According to the temporary reparations plan, 30% of them will be given to relevant countries. It is predicted that after Harrison, the executor of the reparations issue, and his deputy, Meikelai, return to Japan, the plan can be vigorously promoted. Harrison and Mi have gone to the United States a week ago to discuss the reparations issue with the Washington authorities. The 1,015 factories include 93 ordnance factories, 339 aircraft factories, 227 private munitions factories, 24 shipyards, 90 machine tool factories, 28 bullet factories, 21 steel factories, 82 light metal factories, 19 soda factories, 22 sulfuric acid factories, 20 power plants, 8 synthetic rubber factories, 10 synthetic oil factories, and 32 other research institutes. 30% of them have been included in the temporary reparations plan. According to the plan, our country can get half of them. At the same time, senior officials of our delegation to Japan denied to reporters this afternoon that our government had lodged a protest with the Allied Headquarters against maintaining Japan's high industrial level. They believe that even if our government wants to protest, the protest should be made to the Far Eastern Commission, not to the Allied Headquarters, because the Far Eastern Commission is the decision-making body. They also stated that our country advocates that Japan maintain the level of 1930. Japan had not developed heavy industry in 1930.</p>

<h3>Editorial: After the Close of the Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>The world-watched Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference officially announced its close yesterday, the 24th, after holding its final meeting. The delegation representatives from Britain, the United States and France hastily embarked for their return home, each going their own way. From its opening on March 10th to its close the day before yesterday, it was exactly forty-five days. During this month and a half, representatives from the four countries had exerted their best efforts, ultimately hoping that this conference could guide the world onto a path of peace. However, after continuous debate for forty-five days, the result can be described as fruitless, and this is evident from the four resolutions passed at the final meeting. These four resolutions are: (1) To establish a Four-Power Committee to hold its first meeting in Vienna on May 12th, to discuss points of disagreement between the four powers regarding the Austrian peace treaty. (2) The next Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to be held in London in November of this year, to continue discussing major German economic unification issues, where the opinions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union diverge. (3) After the close of the United Nations General Assembly, a temporary Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference may be convened in New York in September. (4) The Berlin Allied Control Council should draft a plan to limit the military forces of each occupying country within Germany before June 1st, to be implemented on September 1st.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that this Foreign Ministers Conference not only failed to draft a peace treaty for Germany but also failed to sign the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow. From whatever angle it is observed, this Foreign Ministers Conference can be described as a complete failure. Before the opening of the Moscow Conference, the world had never held great extravagant hopes, but it was still believed that the signing of the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow was without issue. However, present realities prove that the Austrian peace treaty still needs to be left to the Four-Power Committee to discuss at its meeting in Vienna on May 12th. Moreover, we know that the only reason the Austrian peace treaty could not be signed lies in the issue of German assets within Austria, which is purely an economic factor and can be said to be unrelated to politics. The dispute between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is entirely due to both sides placing too much emphasis on their own interests. Therefore, the failure to resolve the German question was originally expected by the world and is not surprising. However, the obstruction of the Austrian peace treaty, leading to its inability to be signed in Moscow, was something no one expected, inevitably making the world feel that peace is even more distant from the human world. The psychological impact is particularly serious for the development of the world political situation.</p>
<p>Undeniably, this Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was a complete failure. The information we rely on is entirely from news agencies and newspapers, which cannot be regarded as completely reliable. American political and diplomatic figures believe that whether this Foreign Ministers Conference has yielded any results requires waiting for Secretary of State Marshall to return home and report before a judgment can be made. However, if we review the expectations that the four powers had for the Moscow Conference, we can know that the four delegations wasted their breath and did not achieve their desired wishes. Taking the United States as an example, Marshall's purpose in going to Moscow was to promote the establishment of the Four-Power Pact and the Austrian peace treaty, but he has not achieved his purpose. Even Marshall himself has expressed "deep disappointment" with the achievements of the Moscow Conference. Secondly, Britain: since the Foreign Ministers Conference has failed to achieve a reasonable arrangement for the German economy, it cannot reduce the burden on British taxpayers; moreover, there has been no significant development in the treaty revision negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin cannot help but feel depressed. As for France, her expectations for the Moscow Conference were not only numerous but also large. On the one hand, she demanded that the Saar region be economically integrated into the French system; on the other hand, she wanted to put Germany in a state of division and never be able to recover, so that it would no longer threaten French security. However, the conference did not satisfy the wishes of French Foreign Minister Bidault. As for the Soviet Union, she demanded 10 billion US dollars in reparations from Germany and wanted Austria to bear considerable responsibility for this war, and also wanted to obtain some compensation from Austria. However, as a result of the conference, the Soviet Union was unable to extract reparations from current production in western Germany.</p>
<p>In fact, the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference is not only disappointing to the four countries! In the rest of the world, the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference has also made them feel a sense of "vagueness and loss." Since the end of World War II, it has been nearly two years in Europe; in the Far East, it has been a year and a half. However, for two years, true peace has not yet come to the world. At times, it is felt that the god of peace is looming, only hopeful but unattainable, and there is still some hope in the heart, and there is still a glimmer of light in front of us: but after this Foreign Ministers Conference, it is felt that peace is even more distant from the world. Germany and Japan were the culprits of World War II, and the aftermath of the war should be dealt with by concluding peace treaties with Germany and Japan first; but as things stand now, there is no hope of concluding a peace treaty with Germany within this year; we assume that the next Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will end successfully and be able to draft a draft peace treaty for Germany that everyone can agree on, but the German Peace Conference will still not be able to be convened within the year; since the German peace treaty is stillborn, the conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty is even more distant and uncertain, at least it cannot be talked about at present. This is what disappoints us the most.</p>
<p>French Socialist leader Blum published an article in the People's Daily, saying that the greatest achievement of this conference was the conclusion of an agreement between Britain, the United States, and France on the issue of coal. From France's standpoint, because France urgently needs a supply of coal, it cannot be regarded as without reason, but for the interests of the entire world peace, the establishment of this agreement outside the conference is actually more harmful than beneficial. According to the news from the French news agency, Britain and the United States may immediately implement their plan to unify western Germany, and France, because the Saar issue has not yielded results, has established a coal agreement with Britain and the United States, and may also participate in the unification of western Germany. If this news is true, then the tendency of today's world to split into eastern and western worlds will be even more obvious.</p>
<p>In short, this Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference not only failed to lead the world onto a path of peace but also hinted to the world that peace is even more distant from the world. If the political diplomats of the great powers cannot reflect on themselves after the meeting, have a thorough understanding, catch up quickly, use their political wisdom, start from a broad perspective, first eliminate international suspicion and fear, and then establish a spirit of mutual trust and tolerance, thereby breaking the deadlock; then the future of the world will be shrouded in clouds and fog, and the sunshine of peace will never be revealed.</p>

<h3>After the Failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference: France Will Draw Closer to Britain and the United States; The East-West Division of Germany Will Become More Pronounced</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Political figures predict that after the failure of the Moscow Conference, the division between eastern and western Germany will become stronger. The six-week conference failed to reach agreements on major issues, such as: (1) the economic unification of Germany; (2) the form and scope of reparations; (3) the future political system of Germany; (4) the manner in which smaller allied nations participate in discussions on the German peace treaty; (5) the establishment of a Four-Power Treaty to prevent German aggression; (6) the completion of the Austrian treaty; Almost all major issues were unsuccessful. In addition, the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union to revise the alliance treaty have also failed to achieve a concrete conclusion. The Anglo-American-French coal agreement is the only significant achievement of the six-week conference, but this agreement will cause France to further strengthen its relations with the Western occupying powers, forming a more obvious division between the East and West.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 24th] Diplomatic figures here recently stated that it is almost certain that Britain and the United States may implement their plan to unify western Germany with the city of Frankfurt as its capital. It is only a matter of time, whether it will be implemented at this moment, or after the close of the United Nations General Assembly is still unknown. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference achieved no results on the Saar region issue, but the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, have reached an agreement on the coal issue, which is sufficient to make France agree to participate in the unification of West Germany as well.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 25th] The current Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, the longest in history, has concluded today in the worst post-war stalemate between the Allies. Most Western diplomats believe that the Moscow Conference was even less fruitful than the London Conference in September 1945, when the foreign ministers first began to negotiate the treaties with Germany's satellite states, which was fraught with difficulties. The issues discussed at the Moscow Conference, such as the Four-Power Treaty for the Disarmament of Germany and the Austrian Peace Treaty, were far more important than the treaties with Germany's satellite states, and the rift between East and West is even deeper. A few people predicted that there would be much progress this time, and the Austrian Peace Treaty was a smaller issue, and an agreement could be reached, but as a result, even this most modest hope was not achieved, and the Soviet Union tore up the forty-year treaty for the disarmament of Germany proposed by the United States, which was even more unexpected. A few optimistic diplomats felt that "making the issues public" was at least a gain, but most people pointed out that most of the issues had long been exposed to the world. Each country now uses the means of bluntly demanding or firmly opposing the demands of other countries, which makes all issues even more deeply rooted. Previously, each party's position seemed to involve ambiguity, and it was still possible to find ways to compromise without having to worry about face, but now, unless one country or another makes a substantial concession, a solution cannot be achieved. The only concrete development of the Moscow Conference in diplomacy is the closer connection between France and the Western Allies. The Soviet Union's diplomatic policy toward Germany has forced France to invest in the Western countries on major issues to protect its basic security. In short, the Soviet Union's position has remained unchanged since the Lenin era, advocating a strong Germany, a central authority, and industrialization, which is what France fears most. It remains to be seen what impact Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's position on the Saar issue and his demand to establish a strong Germany will have on the French Communist Party. However, US Secretary of State Marshall's calm support of France has won the friendship of Western Europe. At the same time, his demands for the return of some eastern farmland currently ruled by Poland and his firm opposition to Soviet demands for reparations will also have their effect. Although the final value of this kind of propaganda remains to be seen, it can be asserted that it will affect hungry and restless Europe.</p>
<h3>The Next Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Will Be Held in London in November of This Year; A Special Committee Will Be Established to Discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 24th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference held its last meeting this afternoon, passing three resolutions: (1) The next Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in London in November of this year. (2) After the close of the United Nations General Assembly, a temporary Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference may be convened in New York in September. (3) The Berlin Allied Control Council must draft a plan to limit the occupying forces of Germany before June 1st, to be implemented on September 1st.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 24th] When the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference held its meeting this afternoon, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov spoke first, responding to the suggestion made yesterday by US Secretary of State Marshall to hand over the Austrian issue to the United Nations General Assembly for resolution, believing that there was no reason to adopt a different method for concluding the Austrian Peace Treaty from the method used for concluding the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. He proposed establishing a special Four-Power Committee to be responsible for discussing the Austrian issue. Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin both agreed. Foreign Secretary Bevin also said that this committee should deal with matters practically and should no longer cause disagreements on theoretical viewpoints. The Austrian government should compile a list of German assets within its territory and submit it to the Four-Power Committee for discussion. Foreign Minister Molotov also expressed his agreement in principle. In the end, it was decided to establish a special Four-Power Committee to discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty issue, in order to adjust the opinions of the four powers, and it was decided to hold the first meeting in Vienna on May 12th.</p>
<h3>Bevin Expresses Before Leaving: The Solidarity of the Four Powers Has Increased</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 25th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said today: The feeling he should have when leaving Moscow tonight is that "the solidarity of the four powers has increased compared to before the Moscow Conference." Bevin said: "I believe that the detailed exchange of views between countries is most beneficial to further research. I firmly believe that when people recall the Moscow Conference in the future, they will recognize it as one of the most important contributions to peace-building." Bevin also revealed that Britain had never flatly rejected the Soviet Union's request to extract reparations from Germany's existing production, only saying that there were more important issues that had to be resolved first. He believed that the more important issues were, first, to seek Germany's economic unification, second, Germany's political system, and third, Britain's investment in Germany must first be repaid.</p>
<h3>Americans and Soviets Resume Negotiations: Koreans Express Indifference; Syngman Rhee Says He Has No Extravagant Hopes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 24th] People in the American-occupied area of Korea have greatly divided opinions on the prospects for the resumption of negotiations by the US-Soviet Joint Commission. Right-wing newspapers and political leaders have expressed doubt about whether this move can resolve the Korean issue. The left welcomes Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal to reopen the meeting in Seoul on May 20th, believing that it is the only way to complete Korean unification. The liberal "People's Voice" newspaper commented that the resumption of negotiations can prevent the reactionaries' conspiracy to establish a separate South Korean government. Independence leader Syngman Rhee told the press that he did not think the resumption of negotiations by the US-Soviet Joint Commission was important, because we would not send representatives to participate directly. I have no extravagant hopes for future meetings. I neither oppose nor support the commission, but if the United States and the Soviet Union can reach an agreement on the current issues, the result will naturally be good, and I am prepared to abide by its decisions.</p>
<h3>Marshall Departs for the United States: Will Give a Broadcast After Arriving in Washington; British and French Foreign Ministers Return Home by Special Train</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 25th] US Secretary of State Marshall took a plane from Moscow Central Airport at 9:03 this morning (6:03 PM Shanghai time today). The delegations from the United States, Britain, and France, which participated in the Foreign Ministers Conference, will all depart today. French Foreign Minister Bidault and British Foreign Secretary Bevin are both scheduled to leave by special train today. Those who saw Marshall off at the airport included Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, the ambassadors from Britain, France, Greece, and Iran, and US Ambassador Smith. Before leaving, Marshall said at the airport: "We regret that we have not made greater progress. I believe that when we look back on the past, we will know that the work that has been completed is actually more than we realize. I plan to give a formal broadcast report to the American people immediately after returning to the United States." Marshall also expressed his gratitude to the Soviet side for their hospitality and said: "I come from a young and important country. Even if we express impatience, our purpose is very sincere, that is, to see peace come to the world and people's hearts."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 25th] US Secretary of State Marshall, on his way back to the United States from the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, passed through Berlin today for a brief stop, and once again expressed his disappointment with the results of the Moscow Conference. He said: "I had hoped that an agreement could be reached on the Austrian peace treaty, but now I cannot guess when an agreement can be reached. The four foreign ministers will gather in New York in September during the United Nations General Assembly, and then hold a formal meeting in London in November. The Moscow meeting did not discuss a possible meeting between Premier Stalin, Prime Minister Attlee, and President Truman.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th Special Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall can return here on the 26th. In a few days, he will report to the people on the proceedings of the Moscow Conference. Although officials here have not confirmed that he will broadcast the results of the Foreign Ministers Conference nationwide, it is generally expected that he will follow the story of former Secretary of State Byrnes broadcasting to the nation after attending previous Four-Power Conferences.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] President Truman declined to comment on the results of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. He said: Secretary of State Marshall can personally report to the United States on the proceedings of the conference after returning home.</p>

Stalin invited the guests to watch the famous Soviet film "Stone Flower" until 0:05 AM, when Stalin bid farewell, saying "Goodbye", and Bevin replied "Thank you".</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 24th] Soviet Premier Stalin hosted a grand banquet tonight in the "Blue Hall" of the Kremlin, entertaining the foreign ministers of the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Stalin raised a glass on the spot to wish US President Truman good health, a gesture that may be the feature of the banquet. Stalin's toast was in response to US Secretary of State Marshall raising a glass to commemorate the work of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Marshall also made a speech on the spot, saying: The United States is a young country and may be impatient, "In our impatience, it may be understood that we most earnestly desire the early peace and prosperity of Europe."</p>
<h3>British Chiefs of Staff Conference Scheduled for Next Month; US Denies Cutting the Navy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The British Empire Chiefs of Staff Conference is scheduled to be held in May. It will be chaired by the Chief of the Army General Staff, and will discuss all issues related to the Imperial Army. Marshal Auchinleck, Commander of the British Army in India, will also participate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The Senate Armed Services Committee today questioned the Army and Navy Departments about whether there were secret plans to cut the Navy.

<h3>British Prime Minister's Speech: Refutes Churchill</h3>
<p>[Reuters, St Andrews, Scotland, 25th] Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech today at the Scottish Trades Union Congress, in response to the speech made by Churchill yesterday. Attlee said that Churchill seemed to want to make Britain go back fifty years in India. Churchill had said that the empire had been ruined and India had been abandoned. He had been using these terms for years, neglecting the decades of the Indian self-government movement and abandoning the democratic principles he had fought for during the war. When I announced in the House of Commons that India had the right to determine its own future destiny, the opposition party did not object. I do not believe that there are any imperialists in the British Commonwealth or the United States who support Churchill. In this regard, Churchill never thinks and only acts emotionally. Churchill had also gone so far as to say that Britain was on the road to bankruptcy, but it should be known that the current difficulties actually stem from early mistakes. I still do not forget that when Churchill was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he was our most unfortunate Chancellor of the Exchequer. His adoption of the gold standard was the root cause of the suffering we are suffering today.</p>

<h3>Wallace's Lobbying in Europe, Truman Pays Close Attention, Wallace to Form "Peace Crusade" After Returning Home</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] President Truman, when meeting with the press today, refrained from criticizing the Moscow Conference or former Vice President Wallace's lobbying in Europe. However, he stated that Wallace's 15 billion dollar aid plan for the Soviet Union would be one of the topics in the Marshall Report.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] It is learned here that after returning from his visit to Europe, Wallace will organize a "Peace Crusade" in the United States. On April 30th, Wallace will deliver a broadcast address to the world in New York, and then travel to Chicago, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Boston, and other places to give speeches.</p>
<h3>Wallace in Paris, Gives a Series of Speeches</h3>
<p>Urges France to Maintain a Republican System</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th, United Press] When Wallace made an unnamed attack on De Gaulle, citizens in three districts of Paris stood up and cheered Wallace. Wallace stated that France must forever be a republic, free from the poison of dictatorial ideas, not only for its own benefit, but also for the benefit of the world. He did not mention De Gaulle's name, but the audience knew he was referring to De Gaulle's supporters. Tonight's speech was Wallace's last in his European tour, and he will fly to America tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] Wallace stated in a speech to the Anglo-American Press Association today that he maintains a moderate position in politics, so he will avoid contact with the extreme right or extreme left during this European tour. Moderates today have a greater significance for the world than in the past, he said. After dining with the reporters, Wallace went to the Presidential Palace to meet with Prime Minister Ramadier. Wallace then gave a speech at the Sorbonne University at his first public gathering in Paris, stating that current world trends are leaning towards a third world war, and it is too late for politicians to save it. This trend may be rekindled by foolish events or deliberate provocations, leading to a world war. He deeply fears that the governments of various countries and professional diplomats may not be able to reverse this crisis. In short, the current world crisis is already taking effect psychologically, economically, and politically, he said.</p>
<h3>Huang Renlin Inspects Military Facilities in America</h3>
<p>[United Press, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 25th] Major General Huang Renlin arrived here by plane from Oklahoma today to inspect American military facilities. Lieutenant Colonel Lai, his adjutant, and Captain Meyer, a representative from the U.S. Army Department, accompanied him. In the afternoon, they transferred to Chicago to inspect supply depots.</p>
<h3>Prediction of the Japanese House of Representatives Election, Liberal Party Expected to Win</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] According to political observers here, the results of today's House of Representatives election are predicted to be that the Liberal Party will win at least 140 seats, followed by the Democratic Party (formerly the Progressive Party) with 120 seats, the Social Democratic Party with 110 seats, the People's Cooperative Party with 40 seats, the Communist Party with 6 seats, and other small parties and independents with 50 seats.</p>

<h3>De Gaulle Expresses Political Views, Attempts to Re-enter the Political Stage</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] De Gaulle recently declared: Since I created the new National Unity Movement, hundreds of thousands of people have joined, but I have absolutely no intention of establishing a dictatorial regime. My aim is to unite the French people above the existing political parties and create a democratic politics slightly different from the current system, so that voters can freely express their will.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Since De Gaulle's speeches in Bayeux and Strasbourg, hinting at a determination to participate in political activities, he has now indeed returned to the political stage. His remarks at today's press conference were particularly decisive steps in taking this action. His words about the difficulties currently facing French life, and the need for the French people to unite and express their opinions with a common emotion in order to exert political power, reveal his intentions. De Gaulle also strongly stated that the existing political parties have failed to allow the people to express their opinions, and that his French People's Rally (Rassemblement du Peuple Français) will undertake this important task. The impression gained by the reporters after listening to his lofty pronouncements was that De Gaulle's political views remained the same as before. De Gaulle believes that the worsening of the current situation in France is different from that of 1940, but the situation is extremely serious, and that it is his duty to intervene, he said.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The French Communist Party issued a communiqué today, reiterating its advocacy for the establishment of "security committees" throughout the country to resist the activities of reactionaries and the People's Rally led by General De Gaulle.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane Forced to Land After Takeoff from Longhua, Crashes Out of Airport, Kills Three, Engine Damaged, Wheels Broken, Pilot and Passengers Safe, Dai Anguo Arrives in Shanghai to Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Lanzhou route passenger plane flies once a week. Yesterday morning at 8:57, American pilot Moore, along with co-pilot Li Yinjie and radio operator Wen Yonghao, flew a C-47 type twin-engine aircraft No. 141, carrying five passengers and cargo, took off from Longhua Airport. Unexpectedly, five minutes after takeoff (only 10 meters above the ground), it was discovered that the plane's left engine suddenly stopped. The pilot then urgently used the right engine to turn and landed at the airport's east-west runway within five minutes. However, during landing, the brakes also failed and could not be controlled, causing it to rush out of the runway for about 300 yards, stopping at a location about 10 yards northeast of house number 4, Panjiatang, at the west end of the runway. At that time, three residents (two women and one man) of house number 4, were passing by that location, intending to go to the market to buy vegetables, and were knocked down and killed by the plane's right propeller.</p>
<p>Three Villagers Die Tragically</p>
<p>The three villagers who died tragically were: (1) Shi Shen, female, 53 years old, from Qidong, died from a nose injury and bleeding (her husband, Shi Guolin, 54 years old, is a CNAC employee, and her son, Shi Jiankang, 31 years old, is a mason). (2) Xu Lu, female, 52 years old, from Qidong, her forehead was split open. (3) Xu Yicheng, male, 26 years old, was Xu Lu's son. Three-quarters of his head was split off. He was also a CNAC employee (his father, Xu Huishan, 54 years old, is currently a teacher).</p>
<p>Pilot and Passengers Safe</p>
<p>Pilot Moore suffered a slight abrasion to his head, which was very minor, while all the other people only suffered a scare. After getting off the plane and resting briefly in the waiting room, they were sent back to their residences by company cars. It is learned that there were originally more than 20 people scheduled to take the Shanghai-Lanzhou flight, but due to the recent bad weather, only five people boarded the plane temporarily. The most fortunate thing was that the plane was carrying 700 gallons of gasoline, but it did not catch fire. Company officials and those familiar with flight technology all said that Moore's skills were very admirable. As for the damage to the plane, in addition to the engine damage, the right propeller fell off, the landing gear broke, and the fuselage was also damaged, but both wings were intact.</p>
<p>The passenger list is as follows: To Xi'an: Chen Rongxin, Chen Zhu Yixin (husband and wife). To Lanzhou: Liang Yueshanzhang (CNAC employee, transferred to the Hami branch). Zhang Hanxiang and American Breurer (N.F. Breurer).</p>
<p>Demands for Compensation</p>
<p>After the plane crash, Xu Linhai, the director of the Longhua Police Branch, immediately ordered section chief Lin Deming and officer Guo Zhikai to rush to the scene of the accident to maintain order and take photos for evidence. Allison, the director of CNAC's flight engineering section, Chen Hongen, the deputy director, and Gao Dajing, the business director, all went to inspect the scene. The bodies were immediately moved to the side, and later sent to the Changde Road morgue by company car. The morgue is scheduled to examine the bodies today. The families of the deceased demanded that the company provide coffins for the deceased and pay compensation.</p>
<p>As for the company, it has now reported the case to the local court on one hand and reported to the Ministry of Communications on the other. Regarding compensation for losses, it will be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures.</p>
<p>After receiving reports from various parties, the Ministry of Communications attached great importance to the matter and dispatched Dai Anguo, the director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to Shanghai to investigate the truth. Dai arrived in Shanghai by plane at 6 pm yesterday. CNAC officials have scheduled a review meeting this afternoon to review the cause of the accident.</p>

<h3>Illegal Hoarding Exceeding Limits, Eight Rice Shops Investigated</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The police department's economic section was ordered to thoroughly investigate rice shops throughout the city yesterday morning. By 4 pm, as many as seven shops had been found to be holding goods for sale or exceeding the price limit. These included Wanchang on Jinling Middle Road, Tongxin at 105 Xikang Road, Lishungong at 567 Chengdu Road, Huasheng at 233 Weihaiwei Road, Wantun at 435 Beijing West Road, Dashenggong at 31 Yongkang Road, and Zhikang at 213 Qiaojia Road.

Those with serious cases have been detained.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the food section of the Social Affairs Bureau, personally led staff members to thoroughly investigate rice shops selling at illegal prices outside the city yesterday afternoon. At the Dakang Rice Shop on Hengshan Road, two sets of books were found. The one placed outside recorded the price of white polished rice as 160,000 yuan, while another neatly copied set of books recorded 168,000 yuan (the city government stipulates that the transaction price of rice shops must not exceed 160,000 yuan). The shop was suspected of concealing the truth from the government and violating the price limit. The accountant, Zhou Xueshi, was taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Resolving the Heavy Burden on Workers' Lives, Seeking a Compromise Solution, Slightly Different from the Differential Subsidy System, Currently Under Detailed Study by the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The general salaried class and industrial workers in this city are currently hoping that the government will immediately de-freeze the cost of living index, as they cannot bear the pressure of high prices. In recent days, the cotton textile industry unions in four districts, the Zhonghua Book Company, and the newspaper workers' union have separately appealed to the General Labor Union and the Social Affairs Bureau on this matter. Yesterday, the Shanghai Telephone Company workers also submitted a document to the General Labor Union requesting to de-freeze the index. When Wu Kaixian, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, went to Beijing to attend the National Price Conference this time, Zhang Qun, the President of the Executive Yuan, inquired in detail about the price fluctuations in Shanghai. In view of the fact that ordinary workers are unable to make ends meet and maintain their lives due to the impact of rising prices, and that increasing workers' wages needs to take into account whether the capitalists can afford it, President Zhang instructed Director Wu to seek a compromise solution between the two, so that workers' income can maintain their lives, and capitalists will not be unable to survive as a result. The solution may be slightly different from the current differential subsidy system and is currently under detailed study by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Wu, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, who went to Beijing to attend the price conference, returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 24th. When he met with reporters yesterday, he said: This was a small group review meeting, where representatives only reported on the situation in various places and exchanged opinions with each other, and no decisions were made. The formal conference will be convened after President Zhang decides on a date.</p>
<p>The differential subsidy for the six major daily necessities for workers in April will be calculated by the 25th, and the municipal government will announce it on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Issues Sugar Purchase Certificates, Over 3.9 Million Certificates</h3>

<h3>Fan Danian Suspected of Being a Traitor, Trial Concluded, Sentence to be Announced on the 30th</h3>
<p>Three Mitsui Foremen to be Sentenced on the Same Day</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Fan Danian's case of suspected treason was concluded at the High Court yesterday morning, and the sentence is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 30th. Fan is a native of Shanghai, 49 years old, and graduated from Jiaotong University in his early years. He served in the Ministry of Communications and the railway for many years. Before the war, he served as the manager of the Wharf Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government. He is accused of serving as the deputy section chief of the General Affairs Section of "Hengchan Company" during the fall of Shanghai (the section chief was a Japanese, Mori Shigeo). "Hengchan Company" was an organization planned by the puppet regime to build "Greater Shanghai," and occupied a large amount of farmland and British and American overseas Chinese property in Jiangwan. It also forced residents to change their British and American title deeds to Japanese title deeds, attempting to control all the houses in the city. Fan argued that although the company had this plan, it was not implemented until the victory.</p>
<p>Li Yanchen, Li Dengshun, and Li Dengshuang were originally foremen at Mitsui Yangxing's Pudong Wharf. They are accused of leading dock workers to rob and transport merchants' property in trucks in the Hongkou area for six days after the Pearl Harbor Incident. After being reported after the victory, the case was concluded at the High Court yesterday morning, and the sentence is also scheduled to be announced on the 30th.</p>

<h3>Ownerless Coffins Scheduled for Cremation</h3>
<p>Extension of the Deadline for Clearing Accumulated Coffins</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The deadline for clearing accumulated coffins in this city, according to the original regulations of the Health Bureau, was the end of this month. Now, the bureau has granted an extension of six months, until the end of October this year, in view of the current inconvenient transportation and difficulties in handling. Owners of coffins are requested to move them as soon as possible. The Health Bureau plans to schedule the cremation of ownerless coffins and inferior private coffins in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a vacant lot in the American military cemetery in the Hongqiao Cemetery on Hongqiao Road. The Health Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to turn it into a cemetery area, which was approved at yesterday's municipal meeting.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Industry Plans to Ask the Central Government to Establish a Central Guidance Agency</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The pharmaceutical industry in this city believes that various government departments are already being reorganized. The Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, the Shanghai Pharmacists' Association, and the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association jointly telegraphed Zhang Qun, the President of the Executive Yuan, and Zhou Yichun, the Minister of Health, stating that the self-sufficiency of medicines, the reasonable regulation of surplus and deficiency, and the normal development of supporting pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories should all be centrally managed by a central guidance agency established by the central government. The associations believe that our country has had financial difficulties for years, and the establishment of a ministry is not permitted, but at least a temporary remedy should be to establish a pharmaceutical administration department within the Ministry of Health. A meeting was scheduled to be held at the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association this morning to discuss the matter, and representatives will be sent to Beijing to make statements to relevant parties, hoping to implement the plan.</p>
<h3>Haihan Ship Undergoes Minor Repairs, Scheduled to Depart for Tianjin This Morning</h3>

After the Haihan ship's accident, it was towed to the Third Wharf (i.e., Jinliyuan) by two small ships, and after minor repairs, it is scheduled to depart for Tianjin this morning. The issue of responsibility for both parties is under study.</p>
<h3>District People's Representative Assemblies in Various Districts Request an Increase in Budget</h3>
<p>The annual budget for the Shanghai Municipal District People's Representative Assemblies was originally 30 million yuan. The District People's Representative Assemblies in various districts believe that this is not enough to apply. At the Shanghai District People's Representative Assembly Chairmen's Friendship Association meeting a few days ago, Liu Jingru and others were delegated as representatives to request the Council to increase funding. Yesterday, Liu and others went to the meeting to request an additional 32.65 million yuan, totaling 35.65 million yuan, which is more than ten times the original budget. The costs include office expenses, staff expenses, employee expenses, and construction expenses. The council believes that this case is related to the municipal government's overall budget and intends to submit it to the third general meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>Improving the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Most Steel Rails and Sleepers are Corroded, Replacement Planned to Start Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Fu Jun, the Director of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, who was ordered to come to Shanghai to investigate the derailment accident on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, has submitted the investigation report to Beijing and is scheduled to fly to Beiping with Ling Hongxun, the Vice Minister of Communications, this morning, and then travel to the Northeast to inspect road administration. He will also travel with Chen Yanjiong, the Director of the Northeast Transportation Bureau. According to the responsible persons of the two railway bureaus, the two derailment incidents in recent days have caused heavy losses. After Director Chen Bozhuang returns to Shanghai from Beijing, a review meeting on traffic accidents will be held. He pointed out that since the bureau's restoration, it has formulated a recovery plan and a modernization plan. Due to the limitations of foreign exchange and funding, not only the modernization plan has not been realized, but also the increase in vehicles and the replacement of sleepers and steel rails in the recovery plan is beyond its ability. He added that the steel rails used on the railway are all old light-weight (85 pounds) rails from 40 years ago, and many of the sleepers are also corroded. In order to ensure traffic safety and restore express trains, the Beijing-Shanghai Line needs to replace at least 30 kilometers of steel rails and 300,000 sleepers, excluding those recently replaced. Currently, 20 kilometers of steel rails are available. The required parts can be delivered in full by the end of this month, and it is planned to start replacing the rails west from Nanxiang Station next month, which can be completed in two months. The 300,000 sleepers needed have been ordered from the United States, Siam, and Taiwan. The payment for the 100,000 sleepers ordered in Taiwan has been paid, but the payment for the 200,000 sleepers ordered in the United States and Siam has not been paid due to foreign exchange restrictions and it is difficult to transport them in the short term.</p>
<h3>Housing Lease Regulations Revised by the Municipal Council, If the Landlord Does Not Need to Take Back the Property, the Original Tenant Should Continue to Lease</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council recently sent the draft housing lease regulations formulated by the Legislative Yuan, along with the recommendations of the Council's political, legal, and social committees, to each councilor to solicit opinions. Municipal Councilor Zhang Yiqun told reporters that Article 9, Paragraph 6 of the original draft stipulates that "if the agreed lease term has expired," the landlord may terminate the contract. Now, the Municipal Council has revised it to "if the agreed lease term has expired and there is a definite need to take it back for their own use." This means that if the agreed lease term has expired and the landlord does not need to take back the property for their own use, the original tenant should continue to lease it. This is reasonable in law, sentiment, and reason, and I fully agree with it, he said.</p>
<p>The Housing Shortage is Still Serious, the Distribution Period Should be Extended</p>
<p>The unified distribution method for houses in this city that were once inhabited by enemy overseas Chinese but are not owned by enemies or puppets, and allocated to various agencies, will expire on April 30th. The Executive Yuan has instructed how to handle it after the expiration: (1) Houses in Shanghai that were once inhabited by enemy overseas Chinese but are not owned by enemies or puppets will be distributed until the deadline of April 30th. After the expiration, the Enemy Puppet Property Review Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui districts will verify and return them to the original owners. (2) Current residents who intend to continue leasing after the distribution period expires should directly negotiate a lease with the original owner. The responsible person of the Municipal Council recently made a statement on the issue: Since the victory and restoration of this city, the housing shortage has been serious. Last year, the Executive Yuan, in view of this, had a unified distribution method. However, for a year, the serious phenomenon of the housing shortage has not been reduced at all. Once this distribution method is abolished, if the distributees are not given the right to continue to lease and reside, tens of thousands of people from the military, public education, and cultural groups in this city will be displaced, which will inevitably cause great social disputes. Therefore, at the second general meeting in March, there was a proposal to extend the unified lease method, and the two resolutions were: (1) The original residents who are military, public education personnel, and cultural organizations who have been legally distributed and have no rent arrears, etc., are still allowed to continue to live; (2) Those who have been legally distributed and have not signed a contract so far, the original owner shall not refuse for any reason and shall sign the contract immediately. Moreover, at the first general meeting of this council, there was also a suggestion in the Finance and Land Document No. 6 on the issue of housing lease rights that "the original tenant has the right to continue to lease, but this restriction does not apply to those who violate various provisions of the Civil Code," requesting the Legislative Yuan to adopt and implement it when formulating the housing lease regulations. The purpose is also to reduce the various lease disputes caused by the housing shortage in this city. Now, the second point clearly stipulated by the Executive Yuan, once implemented, will inevitably cause various social disturbances due to the different views between the owner and the tenant. In order to eliminate these disturbances, this council has sent letters to the municipal government and the local court, requesting the administrative and judicial authorities to refer to the council's resolutions in the past and adopt them for implementation, he said.</p>
<h3>Unemployment Workers Guidance Association Discusses Celebrating Labor Day</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Unemployment Workers Guidance Committee is scheduled to meet at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on the 28th to discuss celebration matters for the upcoming Labor Day on May 1st. According to Deputy Director Li of the Social Affairs Bureau, the association plans to prepare the remaining relief flour and pork and comfort the unemployed workers on that day.</p>
<h3>Economic Reconnaissance Network Holds Emergency Meeting, Strictly Investigates the Market for Food Rice, Gold, Banknotes, and Cloth</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The economic reconnaissance network organized by the municipal government's garrison headquarters and other agencies held an emergency meeting at the garrison headquarters yesterday morning to discuss a plan to stabilize prices due to continuous price increases. It is learned that the following has been decided: (1) Food Rice: Starting yesterday, the limited retail price was set at 170,000 yuan, which will be strictly enforced. A large number of police officers will be dispatched to thoroughly investigate the rice market to check for refusal to sell national rice, exceeding the price limit, and adulteration of inferior products as inspection targets. (2) Gold and Banknotes: It has been decided to go to various silver shops, gold shops, and all black market trading places to investigate and severely punish in various ways, and to strictly inspect smuggling out of the country. (3) Cloth: Yesterday, the garrison headquarters' cloth group sent personnel in twelve groups to investigate factories, warehouses, cloth shops, and reproduction factories. Anyone who buys a cloth and stores it for more than a month and a half and still refuses to sell it will be charged with hoarding and forced to sell it to the government at the original price.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor Decides to Appeal "Foreign Tiger" Case in the Last Hour, High Court Also Accepts Maysberger's Appeal</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the court sentenced the "Foreign Tiger" case on the 14th of this month, as the defendant Maysberger was only sentenced to one year of imprisonment and the confiscation was only 40,000 US dollars and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, there was considerable attention to whether the prosecutor would appeal. The original complainant also submitted a letter suggesting that the prosecutor appeal. Yesterday was the last day of the appeal period. The prosecutor in charge, Quan Tao, considered it again and again, and finally decided to appeal at 6 pm yesterday, and immediately declared to the criminal court that the reason for the appeal would be supplemented later in accordance with the law. After deciding to appeal, Prosecutor Quan told reporters that the appeal in this case could have been decided earlier, but the case involved a huge amount of US dollars and gold. As the handling agency and the informer can get 30% of the bonus after the gold and banknotes are confiscated, he was deeply afraid that the outside world would misunderstand that the prosecutor was appealing for the bonus. He was unable to make a decision until he appealed in the last hour of the appeal period. As for the confiscation of gold and banknotes, he does not intend to make a request on the number, but only to seek the accuracy of the actual number.</p>
<p>[Another Report] In the case of "Foreign Tiger" Dutchman Maysberger's illegal operation of foreign exchange, the court previously sentenced him to one year of imprisonment and confiscated 40,000 US dollars and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars. Maysberger refused to accept the sentence and filed an appeal with the High Court. The High Court has accepted the case. The case is being handled by Judge Wang Kequan, and it is said that the trial will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Yang Siqi's Tea Party Reception: Overflowing with Sino-French Cultural Exchange; She is the Founder of the Prestigious Diderot Prize; Once Traveled the World Searching for the Mystery of the Ideal Couple</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the French General Assembly held a tea party reception for the press, filled with an atmosphere of Sino-French cultural exchange. The hostess, Mrs. Yang Siqi (Madame Roube Jansky), is a representative of the French Diderot Society and the Parisian Grand Evening News, a versatile philologist, musician, and dancer. Mrs. Yang Siqi is the founder of the famous French Diderot Prize. Established in 1935, the Diderot Prize aims to promote the flow of Sino-French cultural friendship by planning to select and send a French writer or journalist to China for travel each year within ten years. After being held for two years, it was terminated due to the outbreak of the war. Now that the war is over, Mrs. Yang has decided to continue its operation and intends to expand its meaning, not only selecting and sending French writers and journalists to China, but also selecting and sending Chinese journalists and writers to France, one person from each country each year, for a period of four months. All expenses, receptions, etc., will be fully borne by her.</p>
<p>Everything is Ready Except for Transportation</p>
<p>The selection of candidates will be presided over by the Prize Committee. The person in charge on the French side is former Socialist leader Pierre Brossolette, and the person in charge on the Chinese side is Mr. Li Shizeng. The selected writers or journalists should understand a little of the other party's language so that they can delve into the people and make contact with various aspects. For this year's "exchange" affairs, Mrs. Yang Siqi has prepared everything for the French side, and the Chinese side is also almost "completely ready," but the only "east wind" missing is transportation—the problem of the airplane needed for travel. Yesterday, Mrs. Yang particularly emphasized her hope that the Chinese government would "lend a hand!"</p>
<p>Researching Invisible Bacteria that Destroy Marital Happiness</p>
<p>Another extremely interesting endeavor of Mrs. Yang Siqi is her research on the issue of male-female marriage. She feels that there is often an invisible bacterium in the marital relationship of couples that destroys each other's happiness, and she wants to investigate the cause of this. Therefore, in the past few decades, she has traveled around the world to find an ideal couple. Did she find one in the end? Mrs. Yang Siqi remained secretive yesterday, cleverly keeping this a mystery to be revealed next Wednesday (April 30th). Next Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., Mrs. Yang will perform a very special program at the Lyceum Theatre, entitled "Traveling Around the World, Searching for the Ideal Couple." She says its nature is close to a lecture, but it is accompanied by music and dance, all of which are music and dances related to marriage from the various countries she has visited. Besides French, Mrs. Yang can only speak very broken English, but she says that on the day of the performance, she will use a language that is currently kept secret, guaranteeing that every Chinese audience member will be able to understand. Let's wait and see her "ideal couple"!</p>

<h3>Embezzling Payment and Fleeing; Impersonating to Extort</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Lin Yingzhou, 45 years old, a local from Shanghai, the owner of De Kang Rice Shop at No. 274, Lujiabang Road in the South City, had 39,748 catties of barley in his shop. Zheng Renyi from Pao Street, who was well-acquainted with him, and another broker, Chen Zhaoming, sold the barley to the foreign company, the Ke Di Milk Shed, for a value of 22,658,600 Legal Tender. After the goods were delivered, Chen Xiangqian received the payment around 5:00 p.m. on the 23rd and handed it over to Zheng Renyi. Zheng Renyi issued a receipt as proof. Unexpectedly, after obtaining the payment, Zheng fled without a trace. The next day, he forged letters from Communist leaders Zhu De and Mao Zedong, claiming that military funds were needed and demanding that the owner of the firm borrow 50,000,000 yuan and 80,000 dan of white rice, to be delivered to the military headquarters at No. 5, Bao 2, Xietu Road within three days. After receiving the letter, Lin was terrified. Later, his wife, Mao Min, reported the information to the Penglai Branch Bureau. Director Yao of the branch bureau immediately ordered an investigation. After comparing the handwriting, it was determined that it was Zheng's doing. Therefore, the officer in charge was ordered to arrest Zheng Renyi and bring him to justice for trial.</p>

<h3>Two Japanese War Criminals Indicted; Forced Confessions through Torture and Murder of Martyrs; Collecting Intelligence and Inciting Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The military tribunal yesterday indicted two more Japanese war criminals: (1) Shigenori Goto, former deputy commander of the Qingdao Kempeitai, who, starting in January of the 28th year of the Republic of China, served as the person in charge of the anti-communist system of the security police. During his tenure, he was eager to claim credit and made extraordinary efforts to suppress our underground workers, resulting in many wrongful convictions. As a result, the criminal was promoted from Kempeitai to Sergeant Major. In September of the 29th year of the Republic of China, a student named Miao Zongyi was arrested by the enemy Kempeitai in Jinan and escorted to Qingdao, where he was subjected to harsh torture to force a confession, and was eventually murdered at the end of December. In mid-November of the same year, Tan Jintao, an employee of Donglai Bank, was arrested, accused of being an anti-Japanese element, and subjected to forced confessions through torture before being transferred to Beiping for execution. In March of the 31st year, Wang Tingshun, a member of the Kuomintang, was also arrested and subjected to severe torture to extract a confession. He was once exiled to the Xinxing Coal Mine in Manchukuo to serve as a forced laborer. In the third month of the same year (lunar calendar), a man named Wang Fangping was arrested, and the criminal personally interrogated him under torture, ordering the victim's wife to watch in order to extract a confession. The victim, Wang Fangping, eventually died due to the severity of the torture. In August, more than ten members of the Youth League, including Wang Zhenhua and Zhao Zhiting, were arrested. During interrogation, the criminal incited a wolfhound to attack Zhao Zhiting, who died from his injuries on the spot. The others were either exiled to Manchukuo after being tortured, or escaped with heavy bribes. In November of the same year, eight employees of the Military Intelligence Bureau, including Deng Jiren and Ge Yufeng, were arrested, and all were interrogated by the criminal separately. Zhang Zesheng and Cui Yushan were among those who sacrificed their lives under torture. The others were transferred elsewhere, and their fate is unknown. (2) Sueki Higashimatsu, a China expert and ronin who had been engaged in espionage work throughout his life, came to China in June of the 21st year of the Republic of China and successively served in enemy Harbin intelligence agencies, the 10th Division headquarters, and the 3rd Division headquarters. He also served in intelligence agencies in Shanhaiguan, Beijing, Haizhou, and Xuzhou, and served as an advisor to the puppet Funing County government, and the head of the Huaiyin branch of the liaison department, for fifteen years. His mission was to collect intelligence, sabotage the activities of our officers and soldiers, lure our people away from their motherland, spread false information that was unfavorable to our government, and support puppets and incite rebellion. Among them, the massacre of civilians by the puppet Eastern Hebei government and the confiscation of people's property by the puppet Funing County government are the most hateful. At that time, the defendants were both guiding advisors, fueling the flames and could not shirk their responsibility.</p>
<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Mao Dun Arrive in Shanghai After Returning from Sightseeing in the Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>Trademark Dispute Between Needle Manufacturers; Each Party Holds Its Own View</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Xu Rongjin, the person in charge of Dali Hang, reported to the police station on April 24th that Huachang Needle Factory was counterfeiting Dali Hang's exclusive "Lao Lihua" trademark. After receiving the report, the police station went to the address and confiscated ten small bundles of trademark paper. However, according to Cao Tao, the person in charge of the Huachang Needle Factory, the "Lao Lihua" trademark was exclusively used by the Zhonghua Nail Factory, which was founded by the Japanese. He claimed that he had purchased the enemy property through bidding in August of the 35th year, so he believed that the "Lao Lihua" trademark should also be exclusively used by him. Later, he saw that Dali Hang was also using this trademark, so he repeatedly submitted objections to the Trademark Bureau, but they were all rejected. The case was transferred by the police station to the District Procuratorate yesterday for handling according to law.</p>

<h3>Re-trial of the Road Bureau Corruption Case; Only Sun Xuesan Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The parts of the case involving Zhang Honggang and twelve others, in the corruption case of the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, were sent back for retrial. Judge Xie Zhiying of the District Court concluded the trial on the 18th. The verdict was announced at 10:00 a.m. yesterday: "Zhang Hongtu is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for five years for accepting bribes in the performance of his duties. Chen Jingyao, Zhu Biwen, Zhang Kaiyuan, Zhang Zelong, Zhu Peizong, Xia Biwu, Xu Changgui, Li Jie, Cai Zhidao, and He Zu'en are each sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years for continuously accepting bribes in the performance of their duties. Sun Xuesan is found not guilty. The bribes obtained by Zhang Hongtu, 1,000,000 yuan; Chen Jingyao, 890,000 yuan; Zhu Biwen, 890,000 yuan; Zhang Kaiyuan, 290,000 yuan; Zhang Zelong, 1,220,000 yuan; Zhu Peizong, 890,000 yuan; Xia Biwu, 750,000 yuan; Xu Changgui, 600,000 yuan; Li Jie, 770,000 yuan; Cai Zhidao, 700,000 yuan; and He Zu'en, 600,000 yuan, are all confiscated." Cai Zhidao, who was originally released on bail, went to the District Court yesterday to report and hear the verdict and was taken into custody in court. When explaining the reasons for the verdict, Judge Xie specifically stated that Sun Xuesan's verdict was not guilty because Sun originally worked in the Audit Section and was later transferred to the Purchasing Section. He was not aware of the corrupt practices in advance. Although he also received a share of the bribes, his superiors only informed him that it was a subsidy, so he could not be held criminally liable. If the other defendants disagree with this verdict, they can still appeal.</p>

<h3>Middle School Graduation Examination Decided to Be Held as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Director Cao of the Ministry of Education Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the Ministry of Education's order to various provinces and cities to restore the high school graduation examination, Cao Chou, director of the Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education, stated in a speech: The middle school graduation examination is an excellent system. Since the Ministry of Education implemented it, it has been very effective. On the one hand, the examination can gradually improve the level of students. At the same time, all the examination papers are the most ideal reference materials for our educational research. In various courses, which ones should have their weight reduced, and which ones should have their focus shifted? We can produce a reasonable standard by statistically analyzing the results of candidates nationwide. As for the students' level, the Ministry is well aware that it has not made rapid progress due to the eight years of the War of Resistance. The examination questions set by various provinces and cities will not be excessively difficult.

<h3>Certificates of Academic Qualifications for Middle School Students; The Wartime Measures Do Not Apply; Hereafter, Certificates Must Be Certified by the Original School or the Education Department</h3>

<h3>Let's See How the Hong Kong Xingdao Military Team Plays Seoul, North and South Football Stars to Meet at Yiyuan Today</h3>
<p>The long-awaited Hong Kong Xingdao football team, due to weather conditions, repeatedly postponed its trip, and finally took off from Hong Kong on a China Airlines four-engine passenger plane at 3:45 PM yesterday. Except for team leader Hu Hao, who was unable to travel due to other commitments and will depart today, the rest of the 19-member team, led by Deputy Team Leader Shen Songfang, arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 PM and landed at Jiangwan Airport. A telegram had been sent to Shanghai in advance, and because the Sports Association held a banquet at the Kangle Restaurant, to avoid back and forth trips, except for team secretary Ouyang Cheng who went to guide them, the rest waited at Kangle. After all the members got off the plane, they drove to the Jinmen Hotel to settle their luggage, and then went to Kangle for the banquet. In addition to the Xingdao and Seoul teams, the Donghua, Qingbai, Railway, Soviet, and Jewish teams, members of the Referee Association, officers of the Police Bureau of the Garrison Command, and sports reporters from various newspapers, totaling no less than 200 people, were present. The guests and hosts gathered happily and chatted until about 11:00 PM before dispersing.</p>
<p>After the Xingdao team arrived in Shanghai, the match against Seoul was scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM today at Yiyuan. Tickets were sold at the Municipal Stadium starting at 1:00 PM, with prices of 5,000 and 8,000 yuan. To avoid crowding, the three main gates of Yiyuan will be opened simultaneously.</p>
<p>The lineups of the Xingdao and Seoul teams for today's match were decided yesterday and are listed below:</p>
<p>Xingdao</p>
<p>Jin Yaode, Liu Tianshen, Hou Rongsheng, Song Lingsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Songsheng, Cao Qiuting, Wen Zhi, Zhang Jinhai, Zhu Yongqiang, He Yingfen</p>
<p>(Reinforcements) Feng Kunsheng, Li Zhaorong, Liu Guangcai</p>
<p>Seoul</p>
<p>Che Chunzhong, Park Dachong, Park Gyujeong, Zhu Rongguang, Kim Gyuhwan, Min Byeongdae, Jeong Namshik, Jeong Gukjin, Kim Yongsik, Lim Changshik, Woo Jeonghwan</p>
<p>(Reinforcements) Ahn Gapsoo, Choi Seongkon, Min Byeongik</p>
<p>It is said that Xingdao goalkeeper Jin Yaode is famous in Hong Kong, and he will not fail his mission today. The two defenders Liu and Hou are both competent. The midfield line is even more talented, especially the left-footed king Xu Jingcheng, who is good at both offense and defense. The forwards Zou and He are skilled in dribbling, Zhu is young and strong, and fierce in attack. Zhang Jinhai leads and directs from the center forward position, and with the addition of Xiao Sanzi Cao Qiuting, it is like adding wings to a tiger. The lineup is exceptionally strong, and even though Seoul is fierce, it is difficult to be confident.</p>
<p>Seoul's consecutive battles in Shanghai can be described as excellent. Their fast-paced and intensive attack is enough to show their high level. They are becoming more and more brilliant in each battle, and even Donghua, the leader of the Shanghai League, has suffered at their hands. They have been preparing for several days for this battle against Xingdao, resting and recuperating, and have gained a great advantage by facing a team that has traveled far and is tired. However, Xingdao, which dominates the southern country, is not a weak team, so there will inevitably be many exciting and tense moments in this fierce battle.</p>

<h3>Jiao Tong University Forces a Tie with Seoul in a Friendly Match</h3>
<p>The Seoul football team was originally scheduled to play against Xingdao at 5:00 PM yesterday, but because Xingdao failed to arrive on time, they changed to a practice match with Jiao Tong University. The match started at 3:30 PM, with Zhang Jianbing as the referee. In the first half, Seoul's offense was frequent, with more than 15 shots, but they were all saved by Jiao Tong University goalkeeper Qin Dingxin, and they gained nothing. Twenty minutes later, Jiao Tong University defender Xi Zuzhen committed a handball in the penalty area, and Woo Jeonghwan of Seoul took the penalty, but the ball bounced off Qin Dingxin's body. With five minutes remaining until the end of the half, Kim Yongsik, the center forward of Seoul, scored with a powerful shot, and Seoul took a 1-0 lead in the first half.</p>
<p>After changing sides, Li Yagu, the sports department advisor of Jiao Tong University, presented a banner to Seoul, which was accepted by Seoul coach Kim Yongsik. After the start of the second half, the ball still revolved in front of the Jiao Tong University goal. Qin Dingxin was very busy and overwhelmed. Jiao Tong University only sought to lose by a small margin, and the forwards all returned to defense to help defend. Seoul ultimately failed to score. In the 12th minute, Liu Longxin, the central defender of Jiao Tong University, got the ball and passed it quickly to the middle. Zheng Jingtong advanced quickly with the ball and passed it to the left wing. Wu An tricked Park Gyujeong and shot, hitting the net from the left corner, tying the score. After that, both sides had their own attacks and defenses. When the regulation time ended, Jiao Tong University forced a 1-1 tie with Seoul.</p>
<p>Seoul: Hong Deyong, Park Dachong, Park Gyujeong, Zhu Rongguang, Kim Gyuhwan, Min Byeongdae, Jeong Namshik, Jeong Gukjin, Kim Yongsik, Lim Changshik, Woo Jeonghwan</p>

<p>Government bonds were quite mediocre yesterday. Tongbing opened at 13,800 yuan in the morning, with a low price of 23,700 yuan and a high price that did not exceed 14,500 yuan. Near the close, it was still fluctuating. Zhongwu, which had not risen much in the previous day, was relatively more eye-catching. As a result, compared with the previous close, A and B rose by 600 yuan, C rose by 400 yuan, D rose by 800 yuan, and Wu rose by 1,200 yuan. Room 460 and Room 552 were sold, while Room 512 and Room 503 were bought. The transaction volume was just over 2 million.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Slightly Down</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks rebounded slightly yesterday. Only Wheelock Marden and relatively cold stocks were slightly calm, and the remaining stocks all fell back. Ewo Silk opened at 55,000 yuan in the morning, fell to 51,000 yuan, and then rebounded to 55,000 yuan at noon. Finally, because the Hong Kong Shanghai Electric was still rising, it fell back to within 53,000 yuan in the afternoon and closed. Securities brokers first sold, followed by the Guangbang and Jewish merchants. As a result, compared with the previous close, Wheelock Marden and Telephone opened flat and rose slightly, and plantation was flat. Shipping fell by more than half a percent, and the remaining stocks all fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Bulls Holding Back, Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Less</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were relatively stable yesterday. The psychology of the bulls is still based on the rising prices, and they are reluctant to let go easily, resulting in a significant depletion of chips. Upon hearing the news of the free sale of yarn and cloth, they recovered after fatigue and rebounded again. The process was mostly fluctuating.</p>
<p>Morning Open</p>
<p>The rise and fall were both slight. The opening price of Jinglun New Stock was too low, and there were very few chips. It immediately rose to the limit after opening. After opening, Dishui Yarn competed to close at 82, 226, 232, and 224, gradually falling from 4,500 yuan to 4,350 yuan. 85, 91, 235, 231, and 76 slightly increased at the low price, rising by 100 yuan. Finally, with the rebound of Hong Kong Shanghai Electric, people's hearts softened, and 235, 85, 211, 94, and 165 supplied again, and customers also sold, falling to 4,290 yuan. 69, 224, 169, 223, 4, 14, 61, 89, 160, 190, and 226 bought in succession. Underwear rose to the limit from 43 and 173, and pulled Diyong Yarn up to 4,530 yuan. 218, 117, 65, 231, 137, 23, 2114, and 153 were still selling, and were forced down to 4,390 yuan. 36, 185, 224, 153, 85, and 151 came in, and with the addition of Xinho, which was entered by 14, 4, 160, 235, and 95, the rising trend suddenly appeared and remained firm, fluctuating upward. Matches also rose to the limit by 158 and 224. 154, 223, 69, 77, 14, 22, and 215 re-entered. 152 vigorously bought the existing Diyong Yarn. Suddenly, news of the free sale of yarn and cloth came out, and the price rose to 4,610 yuan near noon. 73, 106, and 218 sold and then fluctuated. Xingguang also closed at a high price. As a result, compared with the previous close, Xinho and Yonggong rose by 10%, Huadiao and Meiya rose by more than half a percent, Zhongfa and Yongsha rose slightly, and Jingfu, Xinhua, and Xingguang were flat. For immediate delivery, Yonggong rose by 10%, Yongsha, Meiya, Huafeng, and Xingguang rose slightly, and Xinho rose by less than 10%. Cold stocks Jinglun, Matches, and Underwear rose to the limit, Zhongsheng was flat, Zhongfang, Tongyi, and Xinya each rose by half a percent, and the remaining stocks had insignificant ups and downs.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>21 and 183 entered Wei Jiao stocks, and Diyong Yarn was higher at the opening. 185, 105, and 199 sold to 4,590 yuan. Matches, Underwear, and Yonggong rose to the limit. People's hearts were still good. 223, 22, 14, 183, 152, 47, 171, 4, and 76 all entered. Meiya and Xinho suddenly rose sharply and rose to 4,710 yuan. 14, 137, 160, 97, 102, 62, and 169 sold at high prices, falling to 4,630 yuan. Meiya rose to the limit again, and 36, 94, 117, and 4 all absorbed again, rising back to over 4,700 yuan. 160, 185, 223, and 153 closed in succession. At the time of collection, the falling trend rose again, and Diyong Yarn fell to around 4,550 yuan. 152 bought at the low price, and finally remained above 4,600 yuan. The close was mediocre. As a result, compared with the previous close, Xingguang, Zhongfa, and Jingfu rose slightly, Yongsha rose by half a percent, Xinho and Huafeng rose by more than 10%, and Meiya and Yonggong rose to the limit. Xinhua was uniquely flat. For immediate delivery, Xinho and Zhongsheng rose by more than 10%, Meiya, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose by about half a percent each, Yongsha and Xingguang rose only slightly, cold stocks Zhongfang, Matches, Jinglun, and Underwear all rose to the limit, Tongyi and Xinya rose by 10%, and there were few transactions in Yisi and Rongfeng, which were all flat. The remaining stocks all rose slightly, ranging from negligible to less than half a percent. Outside the market, except for Dasheng and Wuzhou, which rose due to dividend distribution, the remaining stocks were flat.</p>
<h3>Results of Bond Subscription and Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Subscription and Sales Committee for New Bonds revealed the results of the subscription and sales yesterday, including more than ten firms and dealers such as Shanghai, Zhonghua Quangong, Zhongfu, Yongda, Qichang, and Qiantai, which collectively raised US$295,110 in short-term treasury bills.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Committee Plans Measures to Control Yarn and Cloth Re-export</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wu Guozhen, Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, in order to discuss the effective implementation of the three measures recently issued by the Executive Yuan to stabilize yarn and cloth prices, specially convened a symposium with cotton textile industry personnel in this city at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 5:00 PM yesterday.束雲章, 吴味经, 王启宇, 叶鸿元, 郭棣德, and 刘文腾 attended. The talk ended at 6:30 PM. It is said that during the meeting, several regulations on the control of customs declaration and re-export of cotton yarn and cloth were drafted based on the three measures issued by the Executive Yuan and with reference to the Textile Control Committee's measures to control the southward transportation of yarn and cloth. It is said that the application for customs declaration and re-export of yarn and cloth will still target the manufacturers. Vendors must also apply for customs declaration and re-export through the manufacturers. As for the re-export quota, the amount previously shipped to various places will also be investigated separately and regulations will be added. Detailed measures are expected to be officially announced today.</p>
<p>Starting at 10:00 AM yesterday, Jianghai Customs implemented a ban on the free customs declaration and re-export of yarn and cloth. All those without a permit from the Textile Management Committee are not allowed to declare customs and re-export to various ports outside the city. The Customs Commissioner also notified all customs brokers to inform them yesterday morning. After the Customs issued the announcement yesterday morning, yarn and cloth could no longer be freely declared and re-exported. The Textile Control Committee's handling of permit matters could not be started immediately because the various procedures had not yet been completed, so the re-export of yarn and cloth has now disappeared. The yarn and cloth market was stimulated by this, and the market price of cotton yarn in various stalls fell sharply yesterday.</p>

Representatives from the Taiwan Sugar Company and the South Goods Industry Association attended. Section Chief Shao Renzhong chaired the meeting.

The above prices are still to be submitted to Director Wu Kaixian for approval and then submitted to the general meeting for approval. Sugar merchants will be suspended from distribution.</p>
<h3>Native Sugar Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend was stable yesterday, but there were fewer transactions, and there was still an upward trend. Shantou Qing opened at 200,300 yuan to 5,000 yuan, Shunde Qing at 200,000 yuan, and Diao Qing at 188,000 yuan, with more transactions, totaling more than 300 bags.

If the distribution volume is increased, then the market outlook should be expected to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Complying with the Mayor's Price Limit, the Rice Price Increase Slightly Curtailed, Shops Have a Market but No Goods, People are Anxious</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The rice market yesterday was slightly curtailed due to Mayor Wu's strict order that the transaction price of white geng rice should not exceed 160,000, and the door sale price should not exceed 170,000. A total of 1,648 shi of goods arrived in the North and South markets. Because economic police were densely deployed in the market, black market transactions were quite difficult to carry out. White geng rice was steadily priced at 190,000. Bo Dao was 188,000, and Yang Xian was 185,000. Bai Yuan then rose to 210,000. The Bureau of Social Affairs continued to throw out a total of 9,000 bags of white geng, red tip, and Saigon rice. Because the official price of white geng rice was limited to 170,000, and black market transactions would be severely punished, many rice shops responded to the market with inferior goods.</p>
<p>Also, the dark market for rice and grain showed a slight loosening yesterday, but the rice shops all had a market but no goods, which made people even more panicked.</p>
<p>The flour market was stable, with foreign flour at 110,000 and local flour at 73,500. Jeep barrel raw oil rose to 500,000. Soybean oil fell to 490,000. Sesame oil was 510,000. Dalian soybeans were 162,000. Raw peanuts rose to 270,000, and sesame was 200,000.</p>
<p>Bean cake was initially weak and then strong, with little change. Red beans from Nanyang were fiercely absorbed, rising rapidly and running wild by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Green beans from Nanyang continued to be digested, increasing by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Corn rose by another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and red sorghum stabilized.</p>
<p>Must Prepare a Certificate to Purchase Rice in the Production Area</p>
<p>[Our Report from Suzhou on the 25th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently telegraphed various counties, saying that grain merchants going to rice production areas to purchase grain must submit a certificate issued by the county government of their original jurisdiction to the county government of the production area for verification before they can be allowed to purchase freely.</p>
<p>[Our Report from Suzhou on the 25th] The Suzhou County Government believes that the price of rice in Wuxi is higher than that in Suzhou, making it impossible to suppress prices in this county, so it has telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting that all counties in Jiangnan take a unified step.</p>
<p>Saigon Rice Arrives</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Leshthwalmel ship, managed by Moutai Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 1,600 [missing character] bags of rice, totaling 16,000 bags, and is now docked at floats 7 and 8. It is scheduled to be transferred and unloaded today.</p>
<h3>China General Chamber of Commerce Bank Celebrates 50th Anniversary Today</h3>
<p>The China General Chamber of Commerce Bank will hold a celebration ceremony for its 50th anniversary at the Lido Garden on Taixing Road starting at 2:00 PM today, and will exhibit the bank's cultural relics. Chairman Du Yuesheng will personally preside over the opening ceremony, and personnel from the China Electric First Factory will be sent to the site to produce a sound film for commemoration. In addition, the 50th anniversary commemorative book issued by the bank, entitled "China's Economy in the Past 50 Years," discusses our country's economy, finance, public debt, currency system, banks, money houses, transportation, industry and mining, trade, insurance, and trust business in the past 50 years, written by financial and economic authorities such as Song Hanzhang, Chen Guangfu, Qin Runqing, Yang Yinpu, Ye Gongchuo, Jia Shiyi, Dai Mingli, Chen Bingzhang, Qian Changzhao, Shou Yicheng, and Wang Xiaowen. It has already been sent to print, and was originally scheduled to be published on the anniversary and distributed to all sectors. Due to the length of the text being over 300,000 words, printing takes time, and it is said that it will be published next month. As for the commemorative special issue issued by the bank today, it is entrusted to this newspaper to be sent to readers in this port and surrounding areas of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Limited Time Sale of Stored Yarn</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the current yarn market conditions were initially flat outside the market, but later, due to Mayor Wu's personal instructions, the Cotton Yarn Industry Association stipulated that the existing spot warehouse receipts for cotton yarn purchased and stored before March 15 must be sold before May 1. People's hearts suddenly became discouraged. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at a small amount of 12.5 million in the morning, later at 11.5 million. 20-count Special Double Horse was 5.6 million, both down by about 10% from before.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Document Submissions for All Households: Reconstruction of Textile Mill to Resume Rationing</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Reconstruction Corporation resumed rationing to all households who had submitted supplementary documents and passed verification. This includes nineteen households in the knitting industry, three in the underwear industry, three in the handkerchief industry, six in the towel and blanket industry, and one in the canvas industry. Additionally, several households had their rations previously suspended due to lost tax bills. Now, considering the livelihood issues of production factory workers, the corporation has tentatively approved the opening of goods starting next Monday (the 28th). This includes thirty-seven households in the knitting industry, six in the towel and blanket industry, four in the handkerchief industry, one in the underwear industry, and one in the canvas industry.</p>
<h3>The Cloth Market: Overtly Slack but Covertly Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw mostly spot goods being offered outside the trading floor. It was rumored that those who had completed customs procedures, such as the Guangdong and Hubei groups, had slightly increased their imports, so sellers seized the opportunity to hold firm, and the market tightened. Factories still strongly demanded plain fine cloth. Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at 270,000 yuan, 20-count extra fine cloth at 220,000 yuan, and Zijin printed meta-gabardine increased from 223,000 yuan to 228,000 yuan. The limited amount of Jinjian Miaowu meta-gabardine supplied by the Textile Reconstruction Corporation the day before resulted in exceptionally high prices, reaching 230,000 yuan. Retail investors were actively buying, but towards closing, the price of yarn was said to have slightly declined, and some sold off their profits, causing the market to weaken.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Prices Remain Firm and Outstanding</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market prices for woolen fabrics remained ostensibly and covertly firm and outstanding, and trading was also robust. Light-colored thin floral woolen fabrics remained popular. White canvas, hemp glue cloth, and Baifu woolen fabric used for making Hong Kong shirts saw considerable orders and transactions, with the Nanyang group continuing to load up. However, the price of Caishen brand Huada woolen fabric was uniquely flat and weak because its products were far inferior to the old stock. The new goods are thin and soft, so customers all wanted to find the old goods, but the old goods had long been out of stock, and only the new goods were circulating on the market, so their prices were not as firm as those of Xiexin and Hualun brands.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Cotton Reserves Still Abundant</h3>
<p>It is reported that this year, the amount of cotton purchased by the Textile Reconstruction Corporation in various regions has reached around 1.5 million dan. Prices have mostly risen sharply due to large-scale purchases, and recently have become even more severe, with market prices in various regions being higher than those in Shanghai, making it impossible for general cotton merchants to buy. Only in Xi'an, due to transportation difficulties, is the market price lower than in other regions, and reserves are also abundant, with a total amount estimated at over 1.5 million tons.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Taiwan Remittance Limit Relaxed</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Taiwan, which handles remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan, originally had a limit of NT$100,000 per transaction, with a handling fee of 0.2%. Now, in order to facilitate commercial remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan, the bank has recently increased the limit to NT$1 million per transaction and reduced the handling fee to 0.05%.</p>
<h3>Foreign Trading Companies in China Registering in Hong Kong En Masse</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 25th] In the past nine months, 225 foreign companies doing business in China have registered in Hong Kong. Their intention is to open a backdoor so that they can find a refuge if the economic situation in China becomes too chaotic. Most of them are well-known British and American companies that have been engaged in legitimate business in China for many years. The scope of registration is extremely broad, including various types of trading companies, all of which are related to the development of Shanghai and other Chinese commercial ports. The list is as follows: Moutai Trading Company, Jardine Matheson, Dunlop, Rubber Company, Shanghai Water and Electricity Company, Gengxing Trading Company, Jardine Matheson Textile Mill, Shanghai Gonghexiang Wharf Company, Tianjin Real Estate Co., Ltd.

<h3>Shanghai Industrial Association Held Symposium Yesterday to Discuss the Allocation of Import Quotas for Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Industrial Association, for the purposes of (1) discussing the request to transfer the allocation of foreign exchange quotas for industrial raw material imports from the Provisional Management Committee to industrial groups, (2) jointly studying economic reform plans and formulating specific measures to be submitted to the government for implementation, and (3) reporting on the process of requesting the government to establish an industrial association law, convened a symposium of representatives from various industrial trade associations yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Mei Hua Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road. Over 120 people attended, including Lin Jiyong, Wu Yunfu, and Tian Heqing. Ouyang Lun, Director of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Commissioner Chen Taosheng were also invited to attend. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunfu, Chairman of the Association. First, Director Ouyang reported on the placement of 53 demobilized officers and soldiers into 53 factories in the city. Then, member Tao Guilin reported on the process of requesting the government to establish an industrial association law, stating that the organization of industrial associations has its own characteristics and difficulties and cannot be subordinated to commercial associations. In order to achieve China's industrialization, the organization of industrial associations must be sound. Subsequently, Mr. Lin Jiyong reported on the organization of the wartime Sichuan Factory Federation, which assisted factories in solving difficulties, allowing them to focus on production work. At present, after the recovery of industry, there is even more need for such an industrial association organization. Then, discussions began on the allocation of foreign exchange quotas for industrial raw material imports. The following key points were passed: (1) The allocation of import quotas should first be submitted to various industrial trade associations to negotiate principles and values, and the original review should be jointly determined by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and the Industrial Association's review committee. (2) Essential industrial raw materials, accessories, materials, and production equipment that cannot be manufactured domestically should be imported as much as possible according to the actual needs of each industry in order to reduce production costs and lower prices. At the same time, the government should actively encourage the raw material industry in order to achieve self-sufficiency. (3) Finished products (except for necessities and those that cannot be manufactured domestically) should be absolutely restricted in order to protect national industry. (4) The required value of the second phase of import quotas is approximately US$68,114,000 (attached table omitted). (5) Raw materials for which payment was made before February 17 will be allowed to be imported outside the quota. These points will be submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Supreme Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Provisional Import Management Committee for consideration. It was also resolved to (1) telegraph the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Social Affairs to promulgate an industrial association law as soon as possible, (2) have each of the city's 60-plus industrial groups send one representative, accompanied by Wu Yunfu, Chairman of the Association, to petition the Provisional Import Management Committee this morning, (3) organize a petition group to petition in Beijing on a regular basis, (4) have each industrial association appoint a representative to regularly contact and study industrial production issues, etc., (5) have each industrial association quickly and accurately fill out and submit to the association a table detailing the amount and value of raw materials and products needed by the industry, and (6) solicit opinions from each industrial association on the industrial program departments announced by the Third Plenary Session and submit them to the Industrial Association in writing. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The Edge of the Lüda Region</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in the Northeast, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Shenyang, 19th (Airmail)</p>
<p>The Liaodong Peninsula is filled with the beautiful scenery of spring, making people coming from the north feel an infinite vitality here. However, it has played out many "historical tragedies" in the past. Today, the smoke and rain of bullets are still resounding and permeating here, and the national economy and people's livelihood are facing a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Most of the historical tragedies are international in nature. Eighty-seven years ago, when the British and French allied forces invaded, the British fleet once occupied it, and the name "Victoria Bay" was a sensation at the time.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan occupied Lüda and the Far East Peninsula. Forty-nine years ago, the Russians used their strength to lease Lüda. Forty-three years ago, Japan defeated Russia, and Lüda and the Liaodong Peninsula were once again invaded by the Japanese. The Japanese carried out more than 40 years of rule and exploitation. The old people living inside have passed away, and the young people hardly know their motherland.</p>
<p>Under Soviet Military Control; Cut Off from the Motherland</p>
<p>Two years ago, World War II ended, and the Northeast was restored. Lüda and the Liaodong Peninsula were once again cut off from the motherland under the control of the Soviet military. At the same time, the Communist army further covered this place with a layer of encirclement, causing this area to disintegrate and become even more confusing.</p>
<p>At present, the people of the country and people around the world are expecting that China and the Soviet Union will respect the spirit of the friendship treaty, seek a reasonable solution to unreasonable places, so that China can restore its regime, and people around the world can come and go freely. Only then will the future have vitality and be able to shine brightly.</p>
<p>Outside the Gate of the Alert Line; Communist Military Works in Sight</p>
<p>Since last year, Pulandian has become a world-famous town. It stands on the edge of the Lüda region, that is, outside the gate of the alert line of the Lushun naval base stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty.</p>
<p>From Pulandian to Shihe, there is a distance of 25 li from north to south, and the length from the east coast to the west coast is no more than 100 li. In this narrow area, about 100 li long and more than 20 li wide, the Communist army is active.</p>
<p>Walking to a small hill called "Nanshan" on the south side of Pulandian, or to "Taishan" on the north side, and looking far away, the green waters of "Yaha Bay" come into view. The "military works" made by the Communist army on the nearby mountain peaks in the southeast are clearly visible.</p>
<p>The Soviet military's hilltop fortress on the distant high mountains in the southwest is clearly visible. Behind that mountain foot is the famous Shihe. In addition to the Soviet army, there is also a so-called "local security team" wearing blue uniforms at the Shihe Station.</p>
<p>Top Generals on the First Line of China and the Soviet Union Meet Twice</p>
<p>When the reporter was looking out on Nanshan, Soviet planes flew over Shihe in the southwest, circled the bay, and flew back south. Nearby mountain peaks still often sounded with several rapid gunshots, or two or three rumbling artillery sounds.</p>
<p>The two meetings between the top generals on the first line of China and the Soviet Union in Pulandian have once again attracted the attention of many people. There may be a few more in the near future, and the location may be Shihe, where the Soviet military is stationed.</p>
<p>It is said that during the second meeting, our side expressed to Soviet General Charlesky that they planned to make a return visit to Shihe or Jin County. Charlesky said, "You are very welcome, but you must ask for instructions before replying. However, we cannot guarantee your safety, because we were shot at by unknown troops on the way here."</p>
<p>Batches of Refugees Come to Shenyang from Pulandian</p>
<p>The National Army and the Communist Army are confronting each other, and the Soviet army is watching from the side. Batches of refugees fleeing from Dalian, Jinzhou, and Dengshahe passed through this area and ran to Pulandian, and then went north to Shenyang.</p>
<p>The reporter stood at the south entrance of Pulandian and saw refugees, supporting the old and leading the young, coming north. After strict inspection by the National Army and police at the checkpoint, they walked to the reception station.</p>
<p>When asked why they fled, the answer was: "There is no business to do, and we can't exchange it for food, so we have no choice but to flee." They took the "family visit" passes issued by local agencies and took the train to Jinzhou.</p>
<p>Encountering Scattered Soviet Troops; Must Pay "Toll Money"</p>
<p>Refugees described the situation of fleeing as follows: After passing Jinzhou, they had to walk. When encountering scattered Soviet troops, they often had to spend some "toll money." Shihe is an obstacle. They had to set off in the middle of the night, climb mountains and ridges, bypass Shihe, grope and walk, and run in fear. After dawn, they could walk to Wulitai.</p>
<p>"Wulitai" is stationed with Communist troops who inspect and collect taxes before letting them pass. Because they are considered to be goods, they have to collect a tax, otherwise they are not allowed to continue north. After passing "Changdianpu," which is 15 li away from Pulandian, is "Widow Bridge."</p>
<p>Widow Bridge; No Man's Land; Outside Shihe; Strange Wooden Sign</p>
<p>"Widow Bridge" is a so-called no man's land between the National Army and the Communist Army, five or six li south of Pulandian. There are peddlers who specialize in exchanging money, and the exchange rate is 120 Red Army tickets for 100 circulating coupons. The narrow area between Pulandian and Shihe is a complex world. Not long ago, a strange wooden sign with the words "Soviet-Manchukuo Border" was erected on the northern outskirts of Shihe. It is said that the words have now been painted over.</p>
<p>Strive for a Complete Solution; Never Accept Piecemeal</p>
<p>On April 6, the top generals on the first line of China and the Soviet Union met. Because it coincided with the time when the Chinese and Soviet governments issued announcements on the Lüda issue, it aroused the attention of the world. It was learned afterward that the Soviet side was trying to gauge our side's attitude, and was also there to respond to our side's previous proposal to take over "Kongzi Store." The Soviet side stated that only a small number of Soviet troops are stationed in Wazi Store to protect the water source of Lüda. If we can guarantee that the water source will not be damaged, they are very willing to hand it over. In order to seek a complete solution to the entire Lüda issue, we are unwilling to accept it piecemeal.</p>
<p>Wazi Store is in the narrow area between Pulandian and Shihe. It is about 30 li southeast from Pulandian. This is a water source of Lüda.</p>
<p>National Army Outpost; Telephone Often Out of Order</p>
<p>"Tangjiafang," 10 li north of Wazi Store, is stationed with the National Army. That is our National Army's more prominent area. Our liaison with the Soviet army relies on this place.</p>
<p>This distance of more than 10 li is connected by a telephone line set up by China and the Soviet Union to communicate news. When the Soviet side has something to do, they shake the phone over. When we have something to do, the phone is out of order. We must take the liaison symbol to contact them, and we must have armed brothers to protect us, because there are Communist army shootings along the way.</p>
<p>Whether the phone is connected or not depends on the Soviet army. Because the Soviet army only connects the wires when they have something to do, and then disconnects them after they are done, how can we shake it through?</p>
<p>Soviet Army Welcomes Reporters; Not Responsible for Safety</p>
<p>The reporter and reporters from Dagong, Xinwen, Yishi, and Shenchang's "Zhongsu" and "Heping" newspapers, a total of six newspapers, planned to visit Lüda Jinzhou. The letter addressed to the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army in Lushun was forwarded from here. Unfortunately, we received the reply "You are welcome to come, but the Soviet army is not responsible for safety," rejecting us from entering.</p>
<p>The tentacles of the Liaodong Peninsula, everything is confusing. Outside the gateway to the Lüda area, war is burning. Everyone is praying: "Let the war be extinguished, let the tentacles be revived and clear, otherwise it will be unmanageable."</p>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers who planned to visit Lüda took a group photo with Pan Zhe, the Magistrate of Jin County, and the person in charge of the National Army in Pulandian (the third person from the left with his hat off is reporter Han Qingtao from this newspaper, and the third person from the right is Magistrate Pan) (Photo by Xu Jilian, Special Correspondent in Kunming for this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Three Robberies in Kunming</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Xu Jilian</p>
<p>Kunming, 19th (Airmail)</p>
<p>Kunming has finally been quiet for a long period of time. Whether in terms of life or social order, there is a relatively stable force supporting it. Of course, prices are still climbing, but this commercial city rarely sees big storms.</p>
<p>So, after climbing through the winter, we saw the spring scenery again, and then summer came. However, under the circumstances of "no cold or heat in the four seasons, and a rain turns into winter," people rarely pay attention to the changes in the seasons, and it is almost impossible to detect the changes in the weather. Who has the time to pay attention to these things that are not worth discussing? Therefore, everything is proceeding according to a certain procedure, without storms, without changes. The weather is like this, and things outside the weather are also like this.</p>
<p>Bus Hijacked at Hot Springs; Passengers Left with Only Shirts and Pants</p>
<p>However, a series of terrifying events suddenly occurred in the usually tranquil city, which often disrupted social order. No more than robbery, theft, arson, and murder. In the past ten days, Kunming has unexpectedly had all of these unsettling phenomena occur, and they have been presented in a swift sequence, adding a lot of unexpected panic to the residents who have always been accustomed to a comfortable life.</p>
<p>The Anning Hot Springs near Kunming City are well-known. Resting, sightseeing, and taking mineral baths, the hot springs are the most suitable places. On this short highway of more than 30 kilometers, large trucks and small cars travel back and forth every day. Who would worry about the safety of travelers? However, on the 13th, someone just happened to fancy the large bus of the Anning Hot Springs Hotel, blocked the road and carried out a robbery, fired shots into the sky, and showed their power with a fierce momentum. Five bandits showed off their might to the passengers, and thoroughly carried out a "target practice." The passengers were really miserable, only left with shorts and undershirts to return to the city. The bandits left without knowing where they went.</p>
<p>Shocking Robbery; Showing Their Skills in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>The authorities are paying attention to the whereabouts of these bandits who are openly carrying weapons and acting boldly, but they did not expect that other bandits would dare to show their skills in the downtown area. At 4:00 AM on the night of April 17, when everyone was sound asleep, an unprecedented shocking robbery occurred at the residence of Lu Jingqing at No. 2 Xiandian Lane, Zhengyi Road! (Lu Jingqing is the third younger brother of Lu Han, Chairman of Yunnan Province.)</p>
<p>It is really a bit unbelievable. After the incident, before the detective team had arrived to investigate, the reporter rushed to Lu's residence. At that time, Mrs. Lu was still in shock. She described the process of being robbed, which was almost like a story from "The Marvelous Adventures of Knights-Errant." She said: "On the night of the 17th, the weather was dark and gloomy. When I was drowsily falling asleep, the bandits somehow came to the bedside. The semi-Western-style suite had two spring-locked doors, but they managed to open them without anyone noticing, and called people up from the bed. And they didn't wear masks or disguise themselves. They were all middle-aged men with tall figures and clean faces, wearing neat gray suits, just like regular customers of many years. Even the three alert German Shepherds that are usually raised were quiet and silent. He taught Mrs. Lu to take off the ornaments on her body, hand over the self-defense pistol, and not allow her to speak, otherwise he would not be lenient under the gun."</p>
<p>Bandits Rob Gold and Cash; Forcing Mrs. Lu to Hand Over</p>
<p>Everything went smoothly. The strangest thing is that the bandit completely knew the amount of gold and cash hidden in Lu's residence. He was able to teach Mrs. Lu to take them out one by one. He robbed 10,000 US dollars, 100 taels of gold, 60 taels of leaf gold, 700 Vietnamese dollars, and dozens of pieces of jewelry, with a total value that was very considerable.</p>
<p>After the bandits succeeded, they locked the door from the outside. They stepped on the roof in one step, as light as a swallow. By the time the Lu family notified the Fifth Branch by telephone, the bandits had already disappeared. The case is quite complex, and even the detective team felt very棘手. The bandits had said during the robbery: "I personally do not need these things. I am a ×× party, and these gold and cash are used to help people." The identity of the bandit cannot be determined, so we can only investigate in order to solve the case as soon as possible.</p>
<p>South Screen Theater; Threats and Bombs Arrive Together</p>
<p>A wonderful thing happened immediately. On the evening of the 18th, an explosion suddenly occurred at Nanping, a large theater in Kunming City. It was just when the 8:00 PM show was being screened. With a loud bang, the order was disrupted for a while, and the seats flew. Among them, the MN row of seats was destroyed, and there were as many as ten serious injuries to the audience. After the incident, visitors came in an endless stream. There was a shaped earthen pit at the scene of the incident. According to the injured, before the incident, a soldier was sitting on the edge, suddenly bent over to pick up something, and then left the theater. In an instant, a tragic explosion occurred. The reporter also interviewed the person in charge of the theater. It is said that a middle-aged man wearing a white raincoat came to the theater's ticket office in the afternoon and submitted a letter. After opening it, it was found to be an anonymous threatening letter, saying that from now on, within a week, he was to place 10 million national currency on seat number 10 in row S, otherwise there would be an explosion, etc. The theater immediately notified the police station, and the police station also sent plainclothes detectives to wait, but unexpectedly, an explosion occurred that day, which was really somewhat caught off guard.</p>
<p>Deadline to Solve the Case; Reward of 10 Million</p>
<p>It is of course quite enough to pay attention to the terror incidents that have occurred without head or tail, and it is said that the Da Guangming and Kunqiao theaters have also received the same threatening letters. The air in the mountain city is a bit turbulent. In recent days, the police station has been intensifying its secret visits, and Governor Lu of the province has also ordered that the case be solved within a time limit, with a reward of 10 million yuan per case. This trend must not be allowed to grow, because this small mountain city needs a stable force.</p>
<p>Early summer brought new terror to the mountain city, but I hope this is just a slight summer breeze, and we will return to the peace of the past in the future.</p>
<h3>南山屐痕</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 19th.</p>
<p>Spring is deep. Mr. Pan Gongzhan and his wife, Ms. Tang Guanyu, have come to Hangzhou from Linghu. Ms. Tang is a female painter specializing in landscapes, flowers, and birds. We visited Lingyin Temple and boated on the lake, where we saw that many of the naturally lush green colors were punctuated by clusters of eye-searing crimson paint on the buildings. Ms. Tang couldn't help but sigh, and I also found it too vulgar. If this crimson color were to increase further, the entire gentle and beautiful lake and mountains would be diminished. I remembered a new writer, "Anonymous," talking to me about the beauty of West Lake. He said, "So far, the natural beauty of West Lake still surpasses the artificial carving. If West Lake is said to have a unique ingenuity and added artificial cultivation, then these magnificent golden houses towering on Gushan Mountain, as well as the neither Eastern nor Western style exhibition memorial tower in the lake, and the buildings erected freely by private enthusiasts that destroy the atmosphere, and those buildings painted blood-red, none of them show 'a point' that has been carefully designed to make West Lake more beautiful." Indeed, both garden cities and cultural cities require many elegant artists to design and plan them.</p>
<p>The two Mr. and Mrs. Pan and the reporter drove to Hupao Temple the next day. Ms. Tang loves to taste tea. The tea sellers in Hupao Temple brought several packages of tea. The best Mingqian Longjing sold for 90,000 yuan per catty, the second grade for 80,000 yuan per catty, and the best kind, called wild tea, for 190,000 yuan per catty. The tea sellers brewed several kinds of tea for us to taste. Wild tea is not a tea tree grown in tea gardens and is exceptionally rare. Its color is bright and beautiful, and its taste is fragrant and mellow. Combined with the spring water of Hupao, which contains minerals, a full cup of water can be added with half a cup of water without overflowing. The price seems cheaper than in the Xinshichang area, where Mingqian tea in the tea shops sells for 120,000 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>Further ahead, we reached the Liuhe Pagoda. The pagoda is thirteen stories high. Mr. Pan and I climbed the pagoda, but we could only reach the seventh story. The monk told us, "The seventh story is already the top, as two stories are combined into one." We didn't believe it. Looking at the height of the pagoda from the temple gate, we saw people on the ninth story. So, we carefully examined it and found that it was indeed two stories combined into one, and one story was fake. From the top of the pagoda, you can overlook the Qiantang River Bridge and the "Z" shape of the Qiantang River. The famous academic institution, Zhijiang University, is also on the lower right side of the pagoda. Coming down from Liuhe Pagoda, we went to Jiuxi Shiba Jian (Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies). We found ourselves among the green hills on both sides, seeing the mountains covered with low tea trees, and many young girls bathed in the warm sunshine, picking fresh tea leaves with their hands and placing them in baskets.</p>
<p>Stepping over several plank bridges, the gurgling water under the bridge struck the rocks, creating a most pleasant music. We stepped over nine flat bridges in this way and arrived at Jiuxi Tea Plantation. Here, a large sunshade was built, where tea and wine dishes were sold. Many people rested here. In a gap that had been built, three characters "Wash Feet Here" were made on a porcelain enamel sign and hung in the gap. In addition, there were several washbasins, also with porcelain enamel signs that said "Wash Face Here." Seeing these two porcelain enamel signs, I deeply felt that the owner indeed had some refined atmosphere.</p>
<p>Crossing Jiuxi Tea Plantation, the Shiba Jian is nestled among the mountains. Each gully has a considerable distance, but a stream connects them. The water gurgles, clear enough to see the bottom, and many rocks below the water reveal their smooth and bright colors. People must step over the stones in the gullies. Some people who love water go barefoot and wade through the gullies. Originally, the trees on both sides were dense, and the bamboo forests were lush, but now they have been almost completely cut down, making it seem more desolate than before. If the people managing the scenery do not reorganize it, then after a long time, no one will come to play in these places.</p>
<p>Passing Shiba Jian, we reached Longjing Village. There are some trees there, and the village is built along the stream, clean and lovely. Every household has one or two tables, covered with clean tablecloths, with many glass cups inside containing tea leaves. A red paper is pasted on the door, saying, "This household sells genuine Mingqian Longjing." Arriving at Longjing Temple, there are still many trees. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty stayed here twice when he came to Hangzhou. From here, you can overlook West Lake. There are some rockeries, and behind the mountains is a well. The abbot monk has used cement to build a semi-circular well railing with dwarf stones in the shape of clouds from the Qing Dynasty. There are small fish in the well. The monk told us that there are only twelve imperial tea trees on Longjing Lion Peak, and the others were planted later. The higher the tea trees are in the mountains, the better they are; the worse they are in the plains. There are not many tea trees in the high mountains, so they are more expensive. I asked him, "Why is this tea not exported?"</p>
<p>He said, "Too little tea is produced." I think foreigners drink tea heavily and like strong-tasting beverages. We Chinese like to "savor" it. So, this precious green tea can be sold in our country, perhaps because of the different traditional philosophies between foreign countries and China?</p>
<p>Coming out of Longjing Temple, we climbed Longjing Wengjia Mountain to Lion Peak. The scale of selling tea here is larger than in Longjing Village. "Weng Longsheng," "Weng Longsheng," and "Weng Longsheng × Ji" all appear here. Opposite "Weng Longsheng," there is an "Weng Clan Ancestral Hall," but there are only one or two spirit tablets inside. I asked the only clerk in the store why there were so few spirit tablets. He said, "If all were placed in the hall, there wouldn't be enough space, so they were gradually cremated." The tea seller used glass cups to brew tea, and the water had a smoky taste. Ms. Tang Guanyu criticized him for not knowing how to brew tea. The clerk was not tactful at all and did business with customers stiffly. We all said that he should be more tactful and flexible.</p>
<p>In the Longjing scenic area, we only see that Longjing Village has some beautiful meaning, while other places have not been reorganized.</p>
<p>Going downhill to Yanxia Cave, there are quite a few trees. The stone carvings inside the cave are very good, especially the two Guanshiyin statues in front of the cave gate, whose hands are carved very beautifully. But I don't know who has applied rouge and lipstick to these two stone Guanyin statues. Looking from the cave gate, the trees are lush, like a mist, remaining in the eyes. We also entered the side door, where there is a tea house. Further inside, there are several rooms, architecturally very elegant, and there are many poems by scholars, but unfortunately, they have not been reorganized and have been covered by dust. Before the war, this was the most famous place to eat vegetarian food, but now it seems desolate and dilapidated due to the sparse number of tourists. Going down the steps to Shuile Cave, the towering temple here has been destroyed. The abbot of this cave is currently in a lawsuit with the abbot of Jingci Temple. The abbot of the cave said that the abbot of Jingci Temple drove him away and also said that the abbot of Jingci Temple is a traitorous monk. This cave has been artificially carved, but because they have no one to guide them, they still use some stone chimes and stone drums as a selling point, and the newly added things are very mediocre!</p>
<p>Going around through Manjuelong, when osmanthus is in full bloom, there is a lively scene here, but what we saw were dilapidated houses, and osmanthus branches mixed in the weeds. Arriving at Shiwu Cave, a new great hall is being built there. The small Bodhisattvas in the cave are soliciting donations to be gilded, and many Bodhisattvas have been gilded, making them "golden and brilliant."</p>
<p>During our short trip to Nanshan, the three of us had the same feeling. First, many famous historical sites are beginning to become desolate, and many people managing famous historical sites only pay attention to some convenient places in front of them. Second, tourists no longer have the refined interest of people in the past, climbing mountains and crossing rivers to explore the scenic spots. From this, we can see that people today are in a hurry and cannot transcend these worldly thoughts. These worldly thoughts germinate in the heart and easily turn into utilitarianism, and utilitarianism leads to strife. We people in the scenic area, especially those managing the scenery, should find ways to guide them to more remote and more elegant places to play. Perhaps the effort of stealing a few days of leisure can also eliminate some worldly thoughts.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tarkington's Posthumous Work</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yingshen</p>
<p>I mentioned in this publication that the American novelist Booth Tarkington had passed away. Now his posthumous work, "Show Piece," has been published.</p>
<p>Posthumous works are often very interesting, sometimes even unfinished drafts. This "Show Piece" is also an unfinished draft. The development of initial ideas, the refinement of structure, and the authenticity of characters cannot be achieved successfully until the story is completed. We can only get an empty skeleton of a concluding term for "Show Piece." Since the novel has not been completed, we have to be satisfied with the author's footnotes, in which he talks about how things should proceed. I believe that if he had the time, he would have revised his work well.</p>
<p>The so-called showpiece is Mr. Irvie Pease, whom he uses as the first-person narrator to write about. We put Pease in an antique shop, a glass case, or perhaps more appropriately, he lives in the Midwest in the summer, but usually studies in the sacred forest of Princeton. He is the only selfish person who doesn't like humor. He is applauded and praised by his doting parents and friends, so he lives in a false frenzy of success. He once wrote a play that won the praise of the locals and the love of the most esteemed woman. At this time, he had already graduated from university.</p>
<p>He was able to deceive everyone into praising him entirely thanks to his cousin Dan Pu, his neighbor Emma, and his loyal servant. The best scene in the play was written by Liu Pu. Emma, this poor soul, sailed a boat through the storm and saved Pease and his daughter Mary. Emma lied that she was a hero. Later, this lie was exposed by Mary, who married someone else.</p>
<p>This is a melancholy book, as if Tarkington has no strength to cross this century. If this book had been published earlier, it might have been a more praiseworthy and beloved work.</p>
<h3>About Shakespeare</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiahua</p>
<p>Shakespeare lived during England's Dark Ages, when the general nobility of England was immersed in the ascetic ideas of religion, and the people were mostly stagnant and uninspired, with very low levels of knowledge.</p>
<p>Later, England accepted foreign art, especially the brilliant literature of Spain, and the influence of the European Renaissance, which promoted the rise of English literature. In this way, the Elizabethan era became an indelible page in the history of English literature.</p>
<p>Shakespeare was the most important member of this era. His creations are full of optimism and have many aristocratic elements.</p>
<p>His knowledge is very broad. He is an excellent and prolific writer, and each work has his immortal value; he is a world literary master unprecedented and unparalleled.</p>
<p>Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564. He was the son of a farmer, and his family was very poor. He did not receive a good education. He only studied Latin for a few years in elementary school. He worked as a peddler and a lawyer's clerk. At the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years older than him.</p>
<p>For ten years, his life was very difficult, and he was even falsely accused of stealing and fled to London.</p>
<p>Although life tormented the young Shakespeare, often leaving him hungry and without a good night's sleep, he never gave up his pursuit of knowledge. By 1592, he had jumped from manual labor to being an actor in the theater.</p>
<p>Because of his talent and the result of his constant efforts, his acting was welcomed by most people. At this time, he was not only a famous actor but also appeared in society as a playwright.</p>
<p>In his twenty-four-year writing career, his achievements were astonishing. Great writers of the same era, such as Dante, Boccaccio, and Cervantes, did not catch up with him. The artistic achievement of his works can be said to have reached its peak.</p>
<p>His creations are based on reality and history and have a very touching power. He uses various interweavings to naturally infiltrate the darkness, joy, sorrow, hatred, beauty, and ugliness of society into his works with humorous, beautiful, exquisite, and various other methods. He is not only a master of drama, but his poems also have a unique style. In "Sonnets" and "Venus and Adonis," he uses a vivid style to depict beautiful and charming chapters. Therefore, European and American critics generally say that the beauty and immortal value of Shakespeare's works are the essence of the European Renaissance and the epitome of European literature.</p>
<p>On a day the same as his birth, Shakespeare died at the age of fifty-two in 1616, ending his brilliant life.</p>
<p>Now, both the date of his birth and death are more than three hundred years ago, but the masterpieces he left behind still radiate a different brilliance. The publication and translation of his posthumous works have spread to every corner of the world, with virtually no national or ethnic restrictions, and everyone regards them as the Bible.</p>
<p>Now, in Europe and the United States, exploring Shakespearean studies and researching Shakespearean studies have attracted the attention of general writers and scholars. Shakespeare societies have been established one after another and regularly publish various collections of research or reports on Shakespeare's literary legacy.</p>
<h3>Casual Jottings in the Mountains</h3>
<p>— Luo Ming</p>
<p>Spring Rain</p>
<p>Spring has come to the mountain country again.</p>
<p>Although spring has not brought a warmth, the spring rain is continuous.</p>
<p>Ever since that cold winter day, I have been longing for a warm spring. I would gently hum the song of spring or ask the branches of the trees about the whereabouts of spring. I even calculated the series of frozen days. I was happy, and I believed that spring could give my life health and hope. I believed that spring was like a dignified and moving poem. There, I could hear the nobility and beauty of my youth.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I thought, how could I firmly believe that spring is ours?</p>
<p>Indeed, the seasons are so faithful to the world. Now that the season covered by ice and snow has passed, spring has arrived so happily. Although, he is so melancholy, like a shy girl, spending a long series of days in melancholy. Although, he is so undulating, like an ancient zither, playing some slight hopes and languid affection. Perhaps it's like opening the chilly windows of life.</p>
<p>However, spring is still spring after all...</p>
<p>Every day, I pursue the spring I have lost, and I sit in front of the window with a desolate mood and a hope. Here, a mountain stubbornly blocks my view. I cannot look very far and can only look at a row of pine trees by the mountain road and a patch of green seedlings on the terraces, or a cluster of towering mountains. Occasionally, I can see the gray sky, with white clouds sailing by, or a mountain mist falling heavily between the mountains. ——I am quiet, suppressing the beating of my heart.</p>
<p>Although I also wanted to go out of this gray house to visit the sprouting green grassland or a plane tree stretching out its arms helplessly. However, the sky is so happily raining continuously.</p>
<p>I have not forgotten that during this period, I lived without rain boots, so I want to comfort myself and the pedestrians in the wind and rain:</p>
<p>"Let the spring rain fall endlessly. When the spring flowers are not all in bloom, why must we chase the soft sunshine?"</p>
<p>Stream</p>
<p>The stream always flows so happily and loudly. Spring water is full of the four lakes. Today, it sings even more eagerly. Merging the trickling streams to become a water stream, this is a great natural project.</p>
<p>In winter, the stream bed exposed its chest, and the stream dried up and merged into a gurgling spring. At that time, I was like an old man with years to recall, sitting heavily in the bridge pavilion across the stream. I heard the stream flowing weakly in the wide stream bed, feeling a sense of loneliness. Now, in the spring, I sit on the bridge pavilion again, but I am encouraged by the full stream. I can see through the past and imagine the future, feeling that the stronger life is, the more powerful it is.</p>
<p>Continuous rain for days, a stream full of spring water. The lonely activities of the past have turned into angry torrents, and the melancholy singing of the past has also become today's joyful cheers of hope.</p>
<p>Every day, I walk by the stream with a hope. I feel encouraged and inspired, and I understand a sentence even more:</p>
<p>"Not only should there be loud words, but there should also be precise knowledge."</p>
<p>The stream seems to understand that after hope is shattered, it is not over by abandoning and driving it away. In addition to the continuation of days, life also has the efforts to survive to enrich it.</p>
<h3>Studio</h3>
<p>— Seurat</p>
<p>Seurat (Georges Seurat 1859-1891) was originally a painter of the Paris Impressionist school. Seeing that Monet sometimes used pointillism to depict his works, the effect was very good, so he went on to specialize in the study of pointillism. He coincided with several people such as Signac without forming an organization. In 1886, he appeared in the Impressionist exhibition with a new look. At that time, he won social acclaim, and critics called him the "Neo-Impressionist" and "Pointillist" schools. Its characteristic is that no line or flatly painted color can be found on the entire painting. Everything is expressed in dots. The style is novel and delicate, and the forms of light and dark are particularly exquisite. The color changes are endless, and the qualities are all performed appropriately. Unfortunately, he did not live long—only lived for thirty-two years, and left few posthumous works. (Lion)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 405</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Yes," Tsurumi couldn't help but interject, "I'm puzzled, there are so many Chinese people, and their brains are much smarter than the Japanese. Why don't they want to meet the times and do it?..."</p>
<p>"How can you say they don't want to? ...Take these twenty or so people in our dilapidated village as an example. Isn't there a plan to prepare to go this way? In addition, there are many large and small groups. Aren't they also preparing to do it? Our government, although it is a little corrupt, is there really no one with a clear mind who is working hard in this aspect? ...But look at Japan, since annexing Korea, has it been willing to let China take a good breath? Facing the limit, the government has just swept the front of its feet clean and is preparing to start..."</p>
<p>"Yes, I understand. Inside and out, in short, to sum it up, they just don't want China to get better! ...Yes, Big Brother, this time I want to get that 'Seven Sealed Secrets' to expose it. The ultimate goal is also to eliminate this war. Then, China will have a chance to breathe. The government is now aware of it, and the Chinese people can develop freely; isn't it?"</p>
<p>"We'll see!" Shou swallowed the words below, he didn't want to dilute Tsurumi's interest.</p>
<p>These two young people, reunited in such a strange chance encounter, had conversations of this nature; this question led to that question, this sentence led to that sentence, and it could be said that they couldn't finish it in three days and three nights. Fortunately, just when they were talking with great interest, the phone rang.</p>
<p>The phone call was from the Korean leader that Tsurumi had just met: he sent a subordinate to deliver a message to Tsurumi regarding the whereabouts of Pingzi—because the person sent had not met Tsurumi, for safety's sake, the old man called first to inform him:</p>
<p>"A total of fifty taels of chemical raw materials have just been analyzed, and the place of origin and the type of raw materials have been found. I am now sending someone to deliver them. Although this guy is young, he is an expert. Please take a few minutes to meet him."</p>
<p>"Fifty" is a coded word that Tsurumi and the old man had agreed upon, "five minutes past ten," indicating the exact time of the phone call. "Raw materials" refers to the issue of Pingzi's disappearance; "place of origin" refers to the other party's background; "type" refers to the nature of the disappearance, etc. The old man was originally a medical professional, so he used local scenery to deliver the message; outsiders would not be able to suspect it.</p>
<p>Just as the subordinate sent by the old man arrived, Zheng Yan also brought a person with him. This person was the one who went to the Banzai Hall to speak Japanese to Tsurumi.</p>
<p>"Captain," Zheng Yan saluted Tsurumi in a standard manner, with a look of joy on his face, "this is a local friend who received a telegram from Peiping and specially found the captain's lodging place..."</p>
<p>"Very good," Tsurumi replied to Zheng Yan and immediately greeted the newcomer, stepping forward to shake hands.</p>
<p>"Shanghai Special Character No. 2, Li Ming, received a telegram from the Peiping General Captain at 10:00 AM. The department specially sent me to meet you. I went there once at 12:00 PM and just missed you. I went again at 2:00 PM..." He spoke fluent Japanese. This was influenced by Zheng Yan speaking Japanese.</p>
<p>"Sorry for not meeting you sooner, sorry for not meeting you sooner." Tsurumi introduced everyone briefly and asked them to take a seat.</p>
<h3>Sending Two Poems from Afar</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Azure Sky</p>
<p>Ten years ago, there was a period when I was madly in love with the azure sky.</p>
<p>I loved to lean alone at the window at dusk, listening to the breeze cutting through the silent expanse, letting the night dew sprinkle on the crimson windowsill. I gazed at the sky with bewildered eyes. I admired the stars, the moon, the white clouds, the light mist; but what made me sigh and yearn for was the touch of azure sky behind those things.</p>
<p>I said: "The moon is the elder sister, the stars are the younger sisters, and the drifting white clouds and hazy light mist are naughty little maids. Only that touch of azure sky is a kind mother full of true love and warmth!"</p>
<p>So I frantically searched for the azure sky everywhere.</p>
<p>I walked from the spring pond to the summer night garden. I embraced the red maple in late autumn and welcomed the white snow in cold winter. I was tired, lying by the desolate river. I was hungry, picking bitter fruits to fill my stomach. But alas! I just buried the long years in hopeless sighs.</p>
<p>Did I cry bitterly? Who did I hate? Was it the violent wind, heavy rain, and thunder; or was it the dense dark clouds that blocked the azure sky I was searching for?</p>
<p>I dare not dream of miracles appearing, dare not! I have long since dared not!</p>
<p>But today, let me tell you—</p>
<p>I finally smiled! Because outside my window, a miracle, a beautiful and shining azure sky!</p>
<p>Today, I want to write poems, for you—azure sky!</p>
<p>Forget-Me-Not</p>
<p>Do you remember? Not long ago, in front of a quiet lawn in the park, I pointed to a clump of small blue wildflowers on the ground and told you: "The name of these little flowers is—Forget-Me-Not!"</p>
<p>You smiled, turned your head and stared at me, without saying a word.</p>
<p>I couldn't guess what you meant, so I told you this little story again:</p>
<p>I said that once upon a time, a beautiful girl brought her young lover to the beach. On the sloping hillside by the sea, many small blue wildflowers were blooming. The girl asked her lover to pick those wildflowers. The lover stepped down the slope, picked a bunch of small flowers, and was about to return to the shore when suddenly the sea surged. He slipped and fell down the slope, and was swept into the bottomless sea by the terrible waves. So this unfortunate girl regretted and wailed. This poor lover and these blue wildflowers are remembered by people forever, and they are given the name "Forget-Me-Not."…</p>
<p>You were still smiling, still staring at me, without saying a word.</p>
<p>I suddenly became humble, leaning on you, trembling slightly.</p>
<p>"Is it too boring?" I thought.</p>
<p>But you finally opened your mouth, and you said, "This story is good."--</p>
<p>Do you remember? You said this once, with a gentle voice.</p>

<h3>Music Delegation in Dihua</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where popular songs are prevalent, it seems that little attention is paid to formal music. But on the other hand, there are also many people promoting it. Like the National Conservatory of Music in this city, which will add a junior class from the next semester to train talents in various musical instruments. The Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra is also actively preparing for public performances. The Chinese Music Delegation, sponsored by the Shanghai Music Association (an organization of musicians in this city), has been particularly active recently. Their representatives have visited Taiwan, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places one after another. Recently, they accompanied General Zhang Zhizhong, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, to Dihua, where they performed more than ten times at music concerts organized by the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association. Those who went were Ma Enhong (violin), Wu Leyi (piano), Huang Yuanyin (tenor), Chen Liqing (soprano), Ma Sisun (piano), and manager Yu Xinzhu. They received a warm welcome from the local people.</p>
<p>Ma Enhong's violin has a great reputation in the Chinese music scene. He has been proficient in difficult musical pieces since he was a child. He has not reduced his ambition because people call him a child prodigy or a genius. He is still constantly working hard. This kind of talent and effort is really worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>Wu Leyi's piano is one of the most outstanding Chinese pianists. She has performed in symphony orchestras many times before and has been well received by Chinese and foreigners.</p>
<p>Huang Yuanyin and Chen Liqing's singing also have extremely high achievements. Miss Ma Sisun accompanied her brother (Ma Enhong) to play the accompaniment.</p>
<p>People from all walks of life in Dihua welcomed them so much that they specially launched a grand music and dance party for the music delegation when they were about to leave. It was composed of cultural groups of various ethnic groups, with various dances and music. It was performed outdoors in a Peace Square, with more than 30,000 listeners. People from the Uighur, Kazakh, Tatar, and other ethnic groups were all present. After this performance, the music delegation returned to Shanghai a week ago. They are preparing to wait for Miss Zhou Xiaoyan (singer), who is in France, to arrive in Shanghai, and then go to the United States together for a visit.</p>
<p>In the budding era of Chinese music, this music delegation is enough to make us excited. I hope they will bring back some good reference materials when they go abroad.</p>
<h3>Especially Many</h3>
<p>— Henyue</p>
<p>Where it is written that it is not allowed to urinate, there are "especially many" people who urinate.</p>
<p>On the walls where it is written that no posters are allowed, there are "especially many" posters.</p>
<p>Among the personnel responsible for maintaining order, there are "especially many" people who do not obey order.</p>
<h3>Guarantee of Life</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>Recently, two old gentlemen passed away, one a political figure and the other a cultural figure. Their life experiences were different, but they had one thing in common, that is, the news of their death always had a postscript at the end, saying that they were desolate after their death.</p>
<p>The degree of desolation after death may not be the same, but its connotation always means that they did not leave much inheritance, which was not enough to support their wives or educate their children.</p>
<p>In addition to wanting to contribute to the crowd, people always have to take care of their own lives, the lives of their families, and the future lives of themselves and their wives and children. The so-called taking care of the future means having foresight. So, are those who are desolate after their death people without foresight? Not necessarily. Here, it is really necessary to quote an ancient saying: It is not that there is no foresight, but it is unavoidable. This means that in our society, life lacks security. Our nation has always lived on the edge of poverty, and only a few people can have some savings on weekdays to achieve the point of "saving for a rainy day." Most people can only practice "raising children to prevent old age," hoping to rely on their sons' labor to maintain their lives in their later years. If the children are not yet adults, or there are no children, or the children are not reliable, and the old man has already died, then it is inevitable that he will end up desolate after his death. This situation has always been the case before the war, and it is even more serious today after the war.</p>
<p>This desolation after death is the worry of most of us. In fact, not only after death, but even before death, we also have the worry of unemployment and disease. Once we are unemployed or sick, our family will have the same panic as desolation after death. This is called lack of security in life. In order to obtain this security, many people want to earn a sum of money that is far more than they can only maintain their current survival; if they cannot obtain it through legitimate means, they will take risks and do everything to embezzle and pervert the law, even to the point of becoming robbers and traitors, doing everything.</p>
<p>In wealthy countries (such as the United States), the common people often regard political freedom as higher than everything else, while in poor countries, the common people pay more attention to the security of life. It is generally said that poverty is the breeding ground for communism, which is this reason. After the war, Britain actively promoted the social insurance system, which is also this reason. So how will we seek this security of life for the masses?</p>
<h3>Words of a Rice Weevil</h3>
<p>— Li Boshen</p>
<p>Rice, as long as the word rice is mentioned, a three-year-old child knows that there is a rice weevil, just like when a traitor is mentioned, everyone knows that there are Cao Cao and Qin Hui, so today the misfortune of the rice weevil can be imagined. But despite the people scolding him and cursing him, and the government severely cracking down and determined to suppress him, the rice weevil is still not discouraged, and still engages in the occupation of "one person benefits and ten thousand people suffer," which is too "shameless."</p>
<p>Every time the price of rice rises, the government comes out to suppress it. The result of rising and suppressing is always much higher than the original price. Especially today, when rice is considered to be leading the price increase, the government still cannot thoroughly suppress the price of rice, thus affecting other prices to rise without falling. I have a distant relative who is a genuine rice weevil. I really wanted to know some information about rice, so I took the time to ask him in detail. According to him:</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the rice market is just like other businesses, which is common. Because the most basic condition in business, at present, should be the commodity balance rate. For example, the cost of a piece of cloth plus labor is equal to the selling price on the market, a book, a chair..., all have their balance rate. Rice weevils doing rice business also have this understanding. They take a stone of rice from the place of origin to Shanghai. The principle is to buy a stone of rice in the place of origin after it is sold. If this kind of handling can increase to more than one stone, then naturally it is the profit that all employees of the store rely on. Unlike a piece of cloth that is sold on the market, labor profit, etc. have been calculated in it; therefore, even if rice in Shanghai is bought for 100,000 per stone, or 50,000 per stone, they are willing to do so as long as they sell the rice in Shanghai and can replenish it in the place of origin; and the phenomenon of 'hoarding' is nothing more than because the rice weevils want to wait for the price in the place of origin to be cheaper, and replenish the same amount of goods or more in the producing area after selling out in Shanghai. It is also pitiful to say that since last year, which rice weevil can properly conform to this balance rate?</p>
<p>"The reason why the government is now suppressing and cracking down on rice weevils is probably due to the currency balance rate, so it is considered illegal to sell 160,000 per stone of rice in Shanghai when it costs 140,000 in the place of origin. As for the payment of fees other than rice and whether it can be replenished in the place of origin after selling, the government has not taken it into account. Why do rice weevils have to stubbornly recognize the commodity balance rate? Can't they respect the currency balance rate? I believe that people in occupations other than rice weevils have the same feeling." After hearing these words, I don't know what everyone will feel?</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The price of rice has been jumping for days, and the rice weevils also have reasons. Let's publish it temporarily and listen to everyone's opinions).</p>
<h3>Recommendation of "Favoritism"</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>"Favoritism" is a three-act comedy. The content describes the ugly practices of going through the inside line and using nepotism in the current Chinese bureaucratic politics. The script is written quite simply and concisely. First, the characters are related to the concise arrangement of the plot; there are very few extra-territorial developments, and secondly, in the methods of characterization and narrative dialogue, very violent understatement is used to avoid explicit brushstrokes as much as possible, and for the audience, only "knowing smiles" are required without the feeling of "scratching the itch through boots."</p>
<p>The characters include the loyal and honest Chen Jiannan, the enthusiastic and capable good wife Chen Baiqi, the flattering and favored Ma Lihang, the fierce and unreasonable Mrs. Ma, the mediocre and lecherous Deng Tong, and the Mrs. Deng who spreads the net of nepotism. In addition, there are sour scholars and vulgar merchants An Minminzhong.</p>
<p>"Favoritism" is not without criticism of reality, and it is also a satirical comedy worth seeing quickly.</p>
<h3>Features of the Accompaniment Capital</h3>
<p>— Biluo</p>
<p>The half-month ban on dancing has been resolved, and the four clubs of Yangtze River, United, International, and Chongqing have all opened with the sign of concert halls, and the grand occasion has not diminished in the past. It is reported that dance parties can also be held during the day. In addition to the band performances on weekends and Sundays, records are used to broadcast music on weekdays. The tea fee is 3,000, and the coffee milk is 4,000.</p>
<p>Many air-raid shelters were built in this city during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Now, in order to "make the best use of everything," the Chongqing Xingyuan has approved four handling methods: (1) The air-raid shelters near the city's roads will be rebuilt into steel-concrete parking rooms. (2) Those that cannot be used will be sealed with stone bars to avoid danger. (3) When funds permit, large teams will be converted into underground transportation passages. (4) Private air-raid shelters will be closed depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>The vacant land on the main road in the north district has recently been resolved by the Senate to be taken over by the public and rebuilt into parks, libraries, museums, sports grounds, and swimming pools. It is currently being handled by the Urban Planning Committee together with the Land Administration Bureau.</p>
<p>The spring river is rising, and the wheel transportation is smoother than before. Those who plan to "return to their hometowns" are also active. Recently, "selling at reduced prices as soon as they return home" red strips have appeared at the entrances of major stores.</p>
<p>The Victory Memorial Monument has been under construction for several months, and the tower has been built to more than ten feet high. The work is tense all day long, and pedestrians stop and watch. In addition, the tunnel from Qixing South to Heping Road has also been mostly completed.</p>

<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Feifei, let me tell you!" Old Zhu had to put down the bedding in his hand, and went over to her with a smile and said, "Aunt Jin and the others are sitting in a car, which is comfortable and fast. Because it can't hold many people, your mother asked you to go first. Doesn't Aunt Jin like you very much? What are you afraid of with her taking care of you? When you get to Chongqing, you can see your father first...!"</p>
<p>Old Zhu used all the touching words like writing a script. Sure enough, Feifei stopped making noise and listened quietly. Obviously, her young heart had been moved by what Old Zhu said, but the more she said, the more effective her attitude changed. She frowned and began to think carefully.</p>
<p>"It would be better to let my younger brother go with them first!" She looked up and said as if pleading. A naive loyalty was revealed on her small face. "My younger brother is young and can't get used to hardship. He should be made to go more comfortably.... Dad likes him the most. If he goes to Chongqing first, Dad will definitely be even happier...!"</p>
<p>Hearing such words from a girl who was less than eight years old, Zhu Zhaonian's heart suddenly ached, and he almost cried.</p>
<p>And Feifei's words also reminded Lan. Of course, she knew her family's affairs very well. Although Hu Juewen was a scholar, he couldn't be without old ideas. He did prefer Xiao Rong because he was a boy!</p>
<p>"Then..." Lan was about to change her plan.</p>
<p>"But, Feifei," Old Zhu said to Feifei again with a very serious look, "We don't have any other cars right now. Even if we do, it must be a truck, which is much harder than a car. Maybe we have to walk, you are older and your mother can't hold you, can you bear it?"</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid! I'm older, I'm stronger than my younger brother!" Feifei replied immediately, and at the same time raised her two chubby little arms to Old Zhu.</p>
<p>"Then let the younger brother go first." Lan made a decision after deliberation. "Feifei is good, I know!" Saying that, she couldn't help but reach out and gently stroke Feifei's head a few times.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong stood on the ground, looking up and listening to them talk. (4) (4)</p>

<h3>Evolution of The China General Chamber of Commerce Bank</h3>
<p>— Du Yuesheng</p>
<p>This bank was founded on April 26 of the twenty-third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. It was founded single-handedly by the late Lord Sheng Xingxun. At that time, foreign banks had already been established in China. Lord Sheng realized that if the country was to be rich, commerce must be developed, and that if commerce was to be developed, banks must be the most important. He made a proposal, submitted a memorial to the emperor, and was ordered to recruit commercial shares to discuss the establishment. The total capital was set at 5 million taels of silver. General offices were established in Shanghai, followed by branches in Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Yantai, Zhenjiang, and other places, in order to achieve the effect of connecting the fountain and the government organs. His vision is admirable. This is the first bank in our country. In the beginning, all the articles of association imitated foreign banks, and Westerners were hired as managers to provide guidance. The following year, he also requested that the Ministry of Household Affairs issue an edict to all provinces and customs, stipulating that all official funds deposited and remitted should be handed over to the Bank of Communications for collection and remittance. Before long, banknotes of silver and silver yuan were issued to compete with foreign banks. In this way, business was carried out in an orderly manner, and great achievements were made. All the Westerners who were hired had retired one after another. After the Qing Dynasty collapsed and the Republic of China was founded, the atmosphere of banks was greatly opened. The government promulgated revised bank registration regulations and company law. The bank revised its original articles of association and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for approval and registration. At that time, the bank's branches were all over the country. During the years of the Republic of China, the financial industry in this port was attacked by the world financial turmoil, and many were in danger, or even closed down because of this, or were able to maintain and preserve. The government believed that the history of this bank and the Siming China Industrial Bank was longer and the scale was larger, so it tried to help them. It was found that the original share capital of the bank was 5 million taels of silver, which was converted into 7 million yuan of national currency after the abolition of taels and the change to yuan. Half of the amount, 3.5 million yuan of national currency, was collected first. After the shareholders' meeting, the capital was increased and the capital was reduced, and the board of directors was authorized to contact the Ministry of Finance to join the government shares in order to strengthen the strength. After consultation with the Ministry of Finance, it was ordered that the total amount of the bank's share capital should be 4 million yuan. In addition to the original commercial shares, which were converted into 525,000 yuan of national currency, the government joined the government shares of 3,475,000 yuan of national currency. Until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in the 27th year, the four banks in the war zone of Jing, Su, Xi, and Hang first withdrew and established a joint office for the withdrawal of banks in the war zone in Shanghai. Compared with the fire of the war, the government had moved its capital to Chongqing, and I had gone to Hong Kong first. In accordance with the national policy of resisting Japan, I had to work hard in my own position. Therefore, I sent Luo Qinghua to the rear to set up a branch in Chongqing, and I also went to Chongqing to plan together. Before the establishment of the Chongqing branch of the bank, it was appropriate to drastically change the international war situation, and the internal and external response was isolated. In the end, it did not change its original intention, and worked hard to overcome all difficulties. It also went to Qin and Long in person, in order to develop the treasures of the inland. It successively established Lanzhou, Xi'an, Luoyang, Baoji, Pingliang, Tianshui, Chengdu, Ziliujing, WeiYuan each line. In order to complete the financial connection between the west, the north and the south, Hengyang and Guilin branches were established. It was planned to gradually spread to the southeast, and the wars in the Central Plains and Xianggui broke out at the same time. Due to the drastic changes in the military, the Zhayang Street Guizhu branches had to withdraw with the army. The financial network in the rear was fortunate to be established. I deeply felt that the central management mechanism urgently needed to be strengthened internally, so in June of the 32nd year, I submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval to abolish the general office in Shanghai, and immediately established a general office in Chongqing to supervise and guide. It is to implement the central financial policy, cooperate with the overall use of agricultural, industrial, and mining construction plans, and strive to share the important responsibilities of resisting Japan and building the country at the same time. Gu Cheng's Chongqing branch in wartime has grown, and has laid the foundation for the bank's re-creation and revitalization. It is indeed owing to the government's guidance, and the society's increased care for the bank, as well as the hardships of the internal and external colleagues during the Anti-Japanese War, one heart and one mind, gathering strength and completing the mission, which is worth a lot. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, each branch in the occupied area had withdrawn to Shanghai one after another. Due to being hijacked by the enemy and the puppet, business was invisibly suspended. In August of the 34th year, Japan surrendered and the country was restored. The bank was ordered to handle the takeover and liquidation of each branch in the recovered area. I had already arrived in Shanghai for official business. In addition to actively handling it in accordance with laws and regulations, I also announced the resumption of business of the Shanghai branch and its affiliated branches in the Shanghai area. At the same time, I presented to the Ministry of Finance to move the general office to Shanghai for management, and first resumed the branches in Beijing, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Xishang, and Tianjin. The branches and offices in the inland were considered and merged, and the branches were gradually restored in the ports of commerce. Looking back on the past, the bank has reached its 50th anniversary. The weather has been uncertain, and the world has been changing. I remember the difficulties of starting a business, and I am grateful for the unfinished service. The bank has been able to get here today thanks to the support of all walks of life. I dare not run it carefully, and I will do my best to record a small statement, briefly outlining its main points, for the purpose of commemoration.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years</h3>
<p>— Song Hanzhang</p>
<p>Mr. Song Hanzhang has served in the banking industry for over fifty years. This time, he contributed an article titled "The Evolution of Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years" to this bank's commemorative publication, which can be described as firsthand experience and is extremely valuable. This article is the introduction to the text.</p>
<p>— Editor's Note —</p>
<p>The inception of the modern Chinese financial industry began with the China Merchant Bank. It has a history of fifty years since its establishment. This April marks the bank's 50th anniversary, which is also the 50th anniversary of the establishment of modern banks in our country. Fortunately, I have been involved in the financial industry for these fifty years, starting with serving at this bank for ten years, from which I benefited greatly. On this commemorative occasion, I follow the bank's request to write about "Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years," and I will briefly describe the reforms and innovations of the Chinese financial industry in the past fifty years, as a mirror to learn from the past and know the future.</p>
<p>The financial industry is the central hub of all economic activities, like the human body's blood circulation, which cannot be stopped. A sound financial organization can promote the sound development of the economy. Sound economic development further promotes the progress of the financial industry. The two are mutually dependent and should not be neglected. Before the opening of the five treaty ports, our country was still in a closed era, and the domestic economy only sought self-sufficiency. There was neither large-scale production nor a need for modern financial institutions. The so-called financial institutions in the past were only draft banks, money shops, and pawnshops. Their function was only to facilitate the flow of funds and had nothing to do with economic development. Since the Opium War, foreign economic forces have followed. The British-owned Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China first established a branch in Shanghai, issuing banknotes and supporting the country's merchants in trade with China. Subsequently, German, Russian, French, American, Japanese, Dutch, and Belgian foreign banks also continued to establish branches in China, resulting in the complete control of our country's financial power by foreign banks. After the founding of the Republic of China, due to the hard work and unyielding efforts of Chinese-run banks, we have today's great financial industry. Looking back on the past, I cannot help but feel infinite joy. Now, I will briefly describe the evolution of our country's financial institutions as follows.</p>
<p>The origin of China's financial institutions, in terms of history, began with the old-style draft banks and money shops, followed by foreign banks, starting with the Chartered Bank established in 1853. The establishment of China's modern banks began with the China Merchant Bank established in the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign. The development situation from the late Qing Dynasty to the establishment of the National Government in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China will now be described.</p>
<p>(A) Draft Banks and Money Shops</p>
<p>Draft banks and money shops were China's old-style financial industry. Their origin dates back to the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties. The establishment of draft banks began with the Shanxi draft banks, followed by the Zhejiang-Shaoxing and Hefei draft banks, and so on. The Shanxi draft banks, due to their long history and strong capital, had their headquarters mostly in Shanxi. There were also branches in Shanghai, Guangdong, Shenyang, Hankou, Chongqing, Jinan, Xi'an, Zhangjiakou, and other places. In the past, the funds remitted to Beijing by the provincial treasuries were entrusted to the draft banks for remittance. The land tax and lijin collected by the provincial governor's offices, as well as the customs and salt taxes collected by various departments, were often deposited in the draft banks. Therefore, the Shanxi draft banks had a very rich source of funds and convenient remittance services. Later, the Yuanfengrun of the Zhejiang-Shaoxing group and the Yishan Yuan of the Hefei group saw that the Shanxi draft banks were making huge profits, and they also seized the opportunity, leveraging their political background, to emerge. The establishment of money shops in Shanghai was dominated by the Ningbo-Shaoxing and Suzhou groups, followed by the Zhenjiang group. Regarding the origin of money shops, it is said that it was due to the complexity of China's currency system. In the past, when people used copper coins to pay taxes, they had to be converted into silver taels according to the official price. The more conversions, the greater the profit. Therefore, people needed the establishment of exchange shops, and exchange merchants became a necessity of the times. Today's money shops are evolved from these exchange shops. Comparing these two, the draft banks have strong capital and a more prominent reputation, occupying a superior position. Although the capital of money shops is small, they are quite close to the general society. Therefore, both factions can continue to grow. However, the Shanxi draft banks focused on conservatism and self-imposed restrictions, while the Zhejiang and Anhui draft banks were close to officialdom and had smooth interpersonal skills, which was slightly different. The Xinhai Revolution brought about great changes in domestic finance. The draft banks were the first to be shaken and closed down one after another. The money shops also declined for a time. After a long period of operation, they began to recover slightly.</p>
<p>(B) Foreign Banks</p>
<p>The modern foreign banks in China began with the Chartered Bank established in 1853. Following this, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Banque de l'Indochine, Russo-Chinese Bank, Banque Sino-Belge, Citibank, Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Banque Industrielle de Chine, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, and Deutsch-Asiatische Bank were established, totaling more than ten banks. At the beginning of the establishment of these banks, their purpose was to engage in trade with China and facilitate remittance. Over time, they solicited loans from the Chinese government and invested in industries in China, thus changing their original purpose. Later, due to the indemnities of the foreign powers, the surplus of customs and salt taxes had to be deposited in foreign banks, resulting in the financial and fiscal control being restricted.</p>
<p>(C) Modern Chinese Banks</p>
<p>Modern Chinese banks are established according to the operating methods of the West. The establishment of modern banks in our country began with the China Merchant Bank. In the twenty-third year of Guangxu, the Qing government, in order to reclaim its rights and interests, solicited shares to establish the bank. At that time, the total commercial shares were five million taels, with half paid up first, and ordered the bank to issue both silver tael and silver dollar banknotes to facilitate the people, in order to resist the banknotes of foreign banks. At the beginning of the bank's operation, since there were no laws or precedents to follow, the board of directors jointly formulated the articles of association, referring to the precedents and methods of Western banks and seeking strictness. They also hired Mr. Chen Shengjiao, a leader in the money industry, as the Chinese manager, and Mr. Medlen, an Englishman, as the foreign manager, to bridge the gap between the Chinese and foreign silver and money industries. This was the motivation for establishing modern commercial banks in our country. In the ninth year after the establishment of the China Merchant Bank, in the spring of the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Ministry of Revenue奏准 to试办银行,以以为推行币制之枢纽,定名named it the Hubu Bank, and in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, the Ministry of Revenue was changed to the Ministry of Finance, and the Hubu Bank was also奏准 to改名 to the Daqing Bank, and the Regulations of the Daqing Bank consisting of twenty-four articles were promulgated, which was actually the embryonic form of the national bank of our country. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was originally planned to rename the Daqing Bank as the Bank of China. However, due to the government's proposal to reorganize, the Daqing Bank was closed for liquidation, and the Ministry of Finance raised capital and formulated the Regulations of the Bank of China consisting of thirty articles, adopting the joint-stock company system, as a bank jointly run by the government and merchants and concurrently enjoying the powers of a national bank. In addition, the establishment of the Bank of Communications began with the Ministry of Posts and Communications奏准 to establish it in November of the thirty-third year of Guangxu. It drafted the Articles of Association of the Bank of Communications consisting of thirty-eight articles and opened for business the following year. In addition to operating ordinary banking business, it also had the special right to manage the funds of roads, telecommunications, postal services, and shipping, and to issue exchange notes. Before the establishment of the Central Bank in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were both in the position of national banks. As for the general commercial banks established after the China Merchant Bank, the Siming Commercial Savings Bank was established in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu. Since the Republic of China, the establishment of modern commercial banks has increased year by year. In the first year of the Republic of China, fourteen new banks were established. From the third to the fifth year of the Republic of China, due to political turmoil, fewer banks were added. After the sixth year of the Republic of China, they gradually increased. From the tenth to the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the European War had just ended, and industry and commerce flourished for a time, and the government's official prices were also sorted out. During these three years, the number of banks added reached as many as eighty-nine. From the fifteenth to the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, there were large-scale military operations throughout the country, all industries were depressed, and banks declined. Therefore, only seven were added in the fifteenth year, and only two were added in the sixteenth year.</p>
<p>In addition, there is much to say about the rise and fall of the power of Chinese and foreign financial industries. The financial market in our country has always been centered in Shanghai. During this period, Chinese-run banks, as a result of their own efforts, have laid a deep-rooted foundation. Businesses such as deposits, loans, and issuance have developed rapidly, showing good results. A brief list is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the late Qing Dynasty, the power of foreign banks in Shanghai was extremely great. There were few modern Chinese banks, and their power was weak. The only ones that could compete with foreign banks were the money shops in our country. Silver taels were commonly used in Shanghai, and the daily silver discounts and foreign taxes were all opened by the money industry. Banks had to listen to the market. However, the financing of money shops often relied on the assistance of foreign banks, which is the so-called "discounting bills." This discounting of bills was a short-term loan from foreign banks to money shops, mostly for two days. Therefore, foreign banks at that time seemed to be in the position of central banks for our country's money shops. Later, due to the rubber stock market crash, countless money shops closed down. Foreign banks were unable to recover the discounted bills they had made, and since then they have been unwilling to discount bills again. However, since the Republic of China, our country's banks have developed very rapidly. Therefore, many of the discounted bills were made by famous banks in our country. This responsibility for providing liquidity to the market was transferred to our country's banks, and the power of our country's banks was able to expand day by day, and the relationship with the money industry also became closer.</p>
<p>(2) In the past, government authorities with assets mostly regarded foreign banks as the most reliable. Therefore, all cash was mostly absorbed by them. Unexpectedly, the European War broke out, and Japan seized Qingdao. The funds deposited in the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank could not be withdrawn. Later, there was the collapse of the Banque Industrielle de Chine. From this, people up and down in our country realized that foreign banks were not entirely reliable, and they moved their deposits to Chinese banks. At that time, the famous Chinese banks in Shanghai, in addition to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, also included the China Merchant Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Shanghai Commercial Bank, the Jiangzhe Local Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Yanyeh Bank, and the Zhongfu Bank. They were all able to win the trust of society, so their business was booming. The safety of their loans and the seriousness of their work were almost the same as those of British and American banks. Therefore, the prestige of our country's banks increased day by day, and the fact that our country's banking group代兌钞票 for the Banque Industrielle de Chine further enhanced the reputation of our country's banking industry.</p>
<p>(3) In the past, the banknotes circulating in Shanghai were all issued by foreign merchants, and the banknotes of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation were the most numerous. People regarded them as almost the same as cash. Later, the banknotes of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications gained the trust of society and gradually replaced the banknotes of foreign banks. The reason for this was largely due to the fact that the Bank of China in Shanghai continued to maintain cash payment in the fifth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Request to Establish a Bank</h3>
<p>September, 22nd year of Guangxu (1896)</p>
<p>Banks originated in the West. Their main purpose is to circulate a country's wealth to meet the supply and demand of those above and below. The legislation is better than China's draft banks and money shops, and the state has the right to protect rights and interests without interference. Therefore, it can maintain itself without decay. Since the opening of trade with various countries, the Chinese have not known how to do this. Banks from England, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan have come to China, seizing our great benefits. In recent years, Chinese and foreign scholars and officials have clearly seen the root and branch and have also proposed establishing banks. The business hub is closely related, and railways are now being built, which is a grand undertaking. Without the urgent establishment of a Chinese bank, there is no way to connect the qi and veins of Chinese merchants and prevent foreign merchants from holding us hostage. Proponents say that the national bank should issue all funds, select high officials, circulate banknotes, and be issued by the Ministry of Revenue, just like in England and France, where the finances all enter and exit the bank, which is the Ministry of Revenue's foreign treasury. However, Chinese and foreign customs are different, and the Ministry's banknotes have a recent lesson. Applying the official system and operating the trade economy, I am afraid that there will be many obstacles and abuses will accumulate. Some want to entrust important responsibilities to Westerners and obtain foreign funds. Tens of millions of gold can be raised immediately. The words are very sweet, but the power is in their hands, and the gains and losses are not easy to estimate. I believe that banks are a matter for merchants. If merchants do not trust, then their strength will not be united. If their strength is not united, then the matter will not succeed. If you want to be careful at the beginning and plan to the end, you must accumulate small things to achieve great things. I plan to request:</p>
<p>To select and appoint a high official, and to choose from the various provinces gentlemen and merchants who are fair, honest, and substantial, to be the general directors. To call on Chinese merchants to raise capital of five million taels of silver. First, establish the Chinese Bank in Kyoto and Shanghai. Then, branch banks will be added in the provincial capitals and ports in order. According to Western commercial practices, all management will be done by the commercial directors themselves. When I was in Shanghai, I</p>
<p>discussed the matter of banks with Yan Xinhou, the candidate for the office of customs official in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jianghan, and other customs areas, who was in charge of opening official silver shops. Yan Xinhou considered the overall situation and was willing to merge his independently opened silver shop into the public bank, so as to broaden its spirit. He also agreed to follow the regulations of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to use fine paper and machines to print silver notes, which would complement the cash silver. The number of notes printed would be based on the amount of silver deposited, so as to be ready for cash payment at any time. If officials in the various provinces borrow from the bank, they should follow Western precedents and submit a report to the Ministry of Revenue for approval, stating what funds will be used to repay the loan, before a contract can be agreed upon. European national debts of thousands of millions are all handled by banks, issuing bonds and collecting annual interest, which is paid by the bank. With great faith, it is easy to gather things together. In the future, funds allocated from Kyoto and abroad can be transferred through remittances to save on transfer fees. Funds for public use can be temporarily deposited to earn interest. If the silver coins manufactured by the government cannot be fully circulated and profited from, they can be transferred up and down by the bank, so that the officials can sit back and receive the profit of equality. The bank will use the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's articles of association as the standard for employing people and handling affairs, so as to unite the commercial power of the world to run the world's bank. As long as Chinese banks earn one more point of profit, they will recover one point of power from foreign banks. They will also follow Western precedents, and after there is surplus profit, they will酌量提捐 donate to the public. The established articles of association will be observed. Merchants and people will gain convenience, and the state will receive its benefits in secret. When officials and merchants trust each other in the future, and the internal and external political and legal reforms are fully profitable, then the establishment of a national bank will be planned, which will run in parallel with the commercial bank without conflict. Perhaps measures can be seen early, so as to avoid empty words without benefit. I respectfully submit this memorandum and ask for</p>
<p>Your Holy Majesty's guidance and instructions. I respectfully</p>
<p>Report.</p>
<h3>Sheng, Palace Guardian, Memorial</h3>
<p>Memorial on Planning the China Merchant Bank and Gradually Opening Branches, April, 24th Year of Guangxu (1898)</p>
<p>Memorial, following</p>
<p>Imperial Command to plan the China Merchant Bank and gradually open branches. I respectfully submit this memorial for</p>
<p>Your Sacred Majesty's consideration. I, your servant, received the</p>
<p>Imperial Command to solicit merchants to establish the China Merchant Bank. I have been soliciting gentlemen and merchants, preparing sufficient capital, and referring to Western banking laws to discuss and draft articles of association. I consulted with the Princes and Ministers of the 总理衙门, and they carefully reviewed each item, reaching a consensus. I also consulted with the Minister of Beiyang and Governor-General of Zhili, your servant Wang Wenshao, and the Governor-General of Huguang, your servant Zhang Zhidong, to discuss and report on the pros and cons of the bank. The Northern and Southern Oceans investigated to protect the rights and interests. I奏奉 reported with</p>
<p>Royal Approval on April 26th of the twenty-third year of Guangxu. The Shanghai headquarters was opened. From summer to winter, branches in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Yantai, Zhenjiang, and other places were gradually opened. The Beijing bank has also been opened this year. From now on, from the royal capital to the commercial docks, the泉府 mechanisms will be connected like blood vessels, so that they will not be entirely controlled by foreign merchants. The provincial capitals and cities should also gradually set up branches. In recent years, gold pounds have been expensive, and silver coins have been depressed. Prices have soared, and transportation has been stagnant. In Shanghai, the general commercial hub, silver is scarce, and the commercial situation is precarious, facing imminent danger. Fortunately, the China Merchant Bank is maintaining the market. Although silver interest is high, it is still somewhat limited, and it can barely support it. The China Bank is a large and rough vehicle, and its scale is in its initial stage. Therefore, its contributions to commerce and its effects in the evening are gradual. The establishment is based on the establishment of various foreign banks in China. The establishment of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has been more than thirty years. Its momentum is strong, and its foundation is deep. Not only does it net all the funds of foreign merchants, but the China Bank cannot get a share of its profits. Even large-scale trade with Chinese merchants has been going on with Western banks for a long time, and they have deep trust in them. The new situation of the China Bank is not strong enough, and it cannot be superficially decorated to compete with Westerners. Therefore, I originally proposed to make the beginning cautious and the end good, and to accumulate small things to achieve great things as the goal. Now, the establishment has been one year, and the foundation has been laid. From now on, we will expand the commercial power of the Chinese, and recover our own rights and interests. The key lies in whether the official funds allocated from Kyoto and abroad are all transferred to the China Merchant Bank for circulation. If the official funds stored and transferred by the provinces' customs still follow the old route and are transferred to private silver shops, and are never related to the bank established by</p>
<p>Imperial Command, then the commercial and political system will be completely lost. Westerners will laugh, and Chinese people will become more suspicious. Which merchants in the world will be willing to trust it? It is not a small matter related to the overall commercial situation. I believe that the events of today, all of which are for the benefit of the</p>
<p>State. Investigating the bank, there are invisible benefits to the</p>
<p>State, and there are tangible benefits. Qi and blood flow, and merchants and people are convenient. The benefits are invisible, and the remaining benefits are thicker. The more that is returned to the public, the more tangible the benefits are. I have already detailed this in my original memorial. It is necessary to rely on the</p>
<p>State to preside over it from above, and the public and loyal governors and treasurers and customs supervisors to maintain it from below, in order to gradually reap both benefits and promote this grand plan. I request</p>
<p>that the Ministry of Revenue be commanded and circulated to the customs of the provinces. From now on, all official funds stored and transferred must be deposited in the China Merchant Bank for storage and remittance, where the bank is established. This will conform to the system and establish a reputation. When its effectiveness is greatly apparent, such as Zhaoxin stocks, as well as road construction and mining, all matters of soliciting shares can be modeled on Western countries and entrusted to the bank for handling, which will be free from the弊 of official solicitation and suspicion. Therefore, the states of the West and Japan all attach great importance to banks and strongly support them. If you want to enrich the country, you must engage in commerce. If you want to develop commerce, you must first value banks. However, this matter is complicated and difficult, and it is beyond my ability. All the reasons for planning the China Merchant Bank and gradually opening branches are respectfully presented in this memorial. I humbly ask for</p>
<p>His Majesty's Sacred Admonition and Instructions. I respectfully</p>
<p>Report.</p>
<h3>How to Manage Bank Credit</h3>
<p>— Dai Mingli</p>
<p>Director Dai Ligan contributed an article titled "China's Monetary System in the Past Fifty Years" to this bank's commemorative publication, and he elaborated on the legal tender policy to the fullest extent. This article is one section of that article.</p>
<p>— Editor's Note —</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Finance has strictly managed commercial banks. On the one hand, it has been preventing credit expansion, cracking down on speculation and hoarding, and assisting in stabilizing prices. On the other hand, it has been supervising banks' investment of funds in production and construction, as well as increasing the supply of goods through production, sales, and mortgage financing. At the same time, it has been improving the banking system and laying the financial foundation. The main facilities are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Restricting the Establishment of New Banks For the sake of strict management, the Ministry of Finance has placed very strict restrictions on the establishment of new banks. The establishment of sub-branch banks is based on meeting the economic needs of the local area. It must be submitted to the Ministry for approval in advance before it can be established. It is necessary to make them dispersed and universal, so that the local finance can develop reasonably. After the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to adjust the financial economy of the recovered areas, the "Regulations on the Reestablishment of Commercial Banks in the Recovered Areas" was promulgated, which still imposed restrictions based on the actual needs of various places.</p>
<p>2. Depositing Reserve Requirements Commercial banks are required to deposit statutory reserve requirements, which are centrally collected by the Central Bank. This is not only to protect the rights and interests of depositors and concentrate reserves, but also to tighten the credit of commercial banks in wartime, thereby helping to stabilize prices. The "Provisional Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times" stipulate that commercial banks should deposit 20% of their deposits as reserve requirements and transfer them to any of the local Central, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, or Agricultural Bank. After the specialization of the four banks, they were changed to be centrally collected by the Central Bank. After the victory, the "Measures for Managing Banks by the Ministry of Finance" revised the reserve requirements to 10% to 20% for demand deposits and 7% to 15% for time deposits. The reserve ratio is determined by the Central Bank based on the financial market situation, after consulting with and approved by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>3. Supervising the Use of Funds Banks should use funds in accordance with the principle of lending to production and construction projects. Direct banking business and hoarding of goods, or indirect buying and selling of goods on behalf of customers, as well as bank service personnel using bank funds to engage in commerce, are strictly prohibited in order to clarify bank business.</p>
<p>4. Unifying Bank Accounting Subjects The Ministry of Finance promulgated unified bank accounting subjects in December of the thirty-first year, divided into three parts: banking, savings, and trust, which were implemented in the thirty-second year. This measure not only facilitates the bank management work, but also brings significant improvements to the financial business itself.</p>
<p>5. Promoting Negotiable Instruments China's credit system is still in its infancy? The use of negotiable instruments is not yet widespread. In order to promote financial construction and establish a modern credit system, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Measures for Acceptance and Discounting of Negotiable Instruments in Extraordinary Times" in April of the thirty-second year, and designated domestic important cities to implement them one after another. It also worked with the Central Bank to organize a rediscount review committee to manage rediscount business. Thus, the market credit system was established, and the short-term funds needed for production undertakings were fully supplied.</p>
<p>6. Stabilizing Market Interest Rates The deposit and loan interest rates in various parts of Sichuan Province are particularly high, and the collection and payment periods are concentrated, making the financial industry vulnerable to pressure. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly planned to abolish them, but because commercial habits have been practiced for a long time, it first formulated the "Measures for Controlling Deposit and Loan Funds During Specified Periods" to restrict the maximum interest rate. In January of the thirty-second year, it was actually abolished, and the Central Bank changed to listing daily discounts. On the one hand, the Ministry of Finance supervised the Banking Associations in various places to effectively stabilize market interest rates and seek their rationality in the long and short term.</p>
<p>7. Conducting Business Inspections In order to assess whether the banks comply with the provisions of the financial policy, the Ministry of Finance has appointed personnel to go to the banks in various places to conduct regular and irregular inspections, to check the banks' account books and warehouses, and to give instructions and corrections according to the inspection results, or to impose penalties in accordance with the law. Those with serious circumstances are ordered to suspend business, so as to crack down on illegal operations and rectify bank business.</p>

<h3>The Course of Our Nation's Currency System</h3>
<p>— Chen Guangfu</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Guangfu wrote an article titled "Financial Affairs in the Past Fifty Years" for our bank's commemorative volume, "China's Economy in the Past Fifty Years." It is over ten thousand characters long, with elegant writing and historical allusions, making it highly valuable. This article is a section of it. —Editor's Note—</p>
<p>In the past, our country's common people generally used copper coins. Gold and silver ingots were not commonly seen in general transactions. The inflow of foreign silver dollars gradually increased. The common people appreciated their fine minting and were accustomed to using them, leading to their circulation spreading daily. During the late Qing Dynasty, the government itself minted silver coins. Various provinces minted silver coins weighing one tael according to the Kuping standard. Later, they specialized in minting coins of seven mace and two candareens according to the Kuping standard, with sizes similar to foreign silver dollars. However, because officials sought personal gain, the silver content varied. Coins minted in one province could only circulate within its own political sphere of influence. Going beyond that area required a premium. Because of this, the variety of currency at the time became even more complex.</p>
<p>In the decades from the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China, the types of currency at that time could be listed as follows: (1) Among silver taels, there were Shanghai taels, Beijing public taels, Tianjin trade taels, Hankou foreign taels, Nanjing "Erqibao" taels, and various other names in different places. It was almost impossible to fully describe their contents. (2) Among silver dollars, there were Spanish silver dollars, Mexican eagle dollars, Hong Kong and Japanese silver coins, and the dragon dollars minted during the Qing Dynasty. The dragon dollars were diverse, with Jiangnan, Hubei, Guangdong, Zhili, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fengtian, Jilin, Fujian, and Sichuan provinces minting coins with the province of origin marked on them. The fineness varied from 0.9003 to 0.8435. (3) Paper money included silver dollar notes, small silver notes, copper coin notes from provincial official money bureaus or state-run banks and provincial banks, as well as banknotes from various commercial banks. Even private notes could be issued in various places. (4) Subsidiary coins included various copper coins, small silver coins, and "ke" coins. Therefore, before the abolition of the tael in favor of the yuan on March 10, 1933, there was practically no fixed standard currency.</p>
<p>Proposals for our nation's currency system began with Hu Yuzhi, the magistrate of Shuntian Prefecture, in the 21st year of the Guangxu reign. This was followed by Sheng Xuanhuai's memorial to the throne in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign, requesting a reform of the currency system. In the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign, Yang Xuanzhi imitated the British pound. Later, in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign, Robert Hart, the Inspector-General of Customs, proposed adopting the gold exchange standard. Hu Weide suggested adopting the gold standard. In the 30th year of the Guangxu reign, American professor Jeremiah Jenks proposed a gold exchange standard plan. In the 33rd year, there was a plan to use the gold standard in the Ministry of Revenue. In the 3rd year of the Xuantong reign, a Dutch official, Mr. Vissering, proposed a gold exchange standard plan. None of these were put into practice. In the 3rd year of the Republic of China, the National Currency Ordinance was promulgated, using the silver standard. Although Cao Rulin submitted a request to adopt the gold standard in August of the 7th year, and Zhang Zuolin advocated adopting the gold standard in November of the 8th year, these were not implemented either. After the Nationalist Government's unification, it hired a committee to draft a gradual implementation of the gold standard currency system. As a result, customs duties were changed to gold units, and customs gold unit notes were issued, so that customs duties could guarantee foreign debts and reparations without suffering losses due to the depreciation of the pound. Silver coins were also unified in advance to establish a standard. In March of the 22nd year, the tael was abolished in favor of the yuan, and the Silver Standard Currency Minting Ordinance was promulgated. From then on, our nation's currency system gradually unified under the silver dollar.</p>
<p>When our country unified under the silver dollar standard, the United States launched a plan to purchase silver in order to maintain silver prices, causing the outflow of silver dollars and silver bars from our country. As a result, the currency became increasingly tight, and prices fell. Merchants' inventories and industrial products could not cover their costs, and the signs of panic were already emerging. Although the government implemented a silver price equalization tax to prevent the export of silver, Japan openly engaged in smuggling in North China, and the outflow of silver increased even more. At that time, bankruptcies of industrial and commercial enterprises were frequently seen, and the financial economy was in imminent danger. Seeing this situation, Britain, in order to maintain trade with China and the balance of power of the great powers in the Far East, and fearing that our country would suffer another financial collapse under Japan's gradual encroachment, sent Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to China to help us complete the legal tender system on November 4 of the 24th year. It announced that silver was nationalized. The United States subsequently signed a silver agreement with us, making the foreign exchange reserves of the legal tender even stronger.</p>
<p>The legal tender was not convertible domestically but could be used to buy and sell foreign exchange without limit at the legal price from the Central Bank, with each yuan worth one shilling and two and a half pence in British gold. This legal tender was the banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China. Later, the banknotes of the Farmers Bank of China were added. The issuance of other commercial banks was transferred to the legal tender. From this point on, our currency system leapt from the silver standard to the gold exchange standard, thus breaking away from the fluctuations of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, or silver being expensive and gold being cheap.</p>
<p>The legal tender was successful because, first, among the foreign banks in China at that time, British banks were the most authoritative. Since the British government helped us establish the legal tender, all foreign banks in China accepted it, and even Japanese banks did not obstruct it, so it was very smooth. Second, the banknotes issued by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Commercial Bank had been circulating for a long time and had established credit. The common people were accustomed to using them and no longer redeemed them for silver. Therefore, circulation was widespread even in remote areas, and the quantity gradually increased. The silver dollars held in reserve were even more abundant. These banknotes already possessed the conditions of legal tender, were trusted by the people, and were not like the indiscriminate issuance and suspension of redemption by the warlords in various provinces, which shook the economic foundation and harmed the people. The legal tender had this important factor, so at the beginning of the reform, the common people neither experienced inconvenience nor harbored suspicion. The silver dollars remaining in the hands of the people were then gradually collected by the government. This cannot but be attributed to the appropriate measures and maintenance taken by the organizers of these banks over the years.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the legal tender system was established for less than a year when Japan launched a full-scale invasion of our country, and our country had no choice but to engage in a long-term war of resistance. It is said that the success of the war of resistance depended on the legal tender. Without the legal tender, the war of resistance would have been even more difficult. During the war, the issuance of legal tender was concentrated in the Central Bank by the four banks. The foreign exchange rate of the legal tender changed from an unlimited supply of foreign exchange to requiring approval, and because of the enemy and puppet regime's arbitrage, it changed to an exchange stabilization fund and foreign exchange control. The exchange rate with the US dollar has evolved from three yuan and three jiao to today's listed price of twelve thousand yuan. The domestic price of the legal tender has differed by nearly ten thousand times. Most people have suffered greatly, and their lives have become increasingly difficult. If domestic politics can be stabilized, the balance of international payments can be achieved, and the state budget's expenditures and revenues can be matched, then the value of the legal tender can be stabilized, so that people's livelihoods can gradually recover. This is the key to the current financial situation.</p>
<h3>Progress in the Number of Banking Institutions Over the Past Fifty Years</h3>
<p>— Yang Yinpu</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Shiyong wrote an article titled "China's Banking Industry in the Past Fifty Years" for our bank's 50th anniversary commemorative book, "China's Economy in the Past Fifty Years," which is 20,000 words long. This article is one section of it. —Editor's Note—</p>
<p>The progress in the number of banking institutions over the past fifty years is quite obvious. It is divided into four periods: (1) the late Qing period, (2) the pre-War of Resistance period, (3) the War of Resistance period, and (4) the early post-war period. The late Qing period is counted from the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign to the 3rd year of the Xuantong reign, a total of fourteen years. The pre-War of Resistance period is counted from the 1st year of the Republic of China to the "July 7th" Incident, a total of more than twenty-five years. The War of Resistance period is counted from the 26th year of the Republic of China to the autumn of the 34th year, a total of eight years and some months. The early post-war period is from September of the 34th year to the present.</p>
<p>(A) Progress in the Late Qing Period: The China General Chamber of Commerce Bank was approved for establishment in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign. In the eight or nine years after that, no new banks were established. It was not until the establishment of the Ministry of Revenue Bank in the spring of the 31st year of the Guangxu reign that new banks began to appear every year. In total, seventeen banks were established one after another in the fourteen years from the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign to the 3rd year of the Xuantong reign. This was because the social and economic environment at that time did not yet show an urgent need for modern banks. At the same time, Shanxi banks and native banks were spread throughout the country and were very developed in their business. Foreign banks, with their economic power, were entrenched in major cities, all of which gave new banks an intangible obstacle. In the last six or seven years of the Qing Dynasty, as many as sixteen banks were established. Under the conditions at that time, this was already a very prosperous phenomenon.</p>
<p>(B) Progress Before the War of Resistance: With the founding of the Republic of China, politics was renewed, and industry and commerce were stimulated, leading to a sudden surge in vitality. The establishment of banks also became more active. In the first year of the Republic of China, as many as fourteen new banks were established. After that, new banks were established every year. By the 16th year of the Republic of China, a total of 185 banks had been established. Among them, the situation was particularly prosperous in the seven years from the 6th year to the 12th year of the Republic of China, with 131 new banks established. At that time, it coincided with the European War, and the source of foreign goods was blocked. Domestic industry and commerce made considerable progress, and the need for capital adjustment increased. The increase in the number of banks was inevitable. In addition, the Beijing government launched a large-scale domestic debt, which helped promote the rise of a large number of northern banks at that time. This was the initial boom in China's banking industry. In the following years, due to the large-scale military operations in the country, some industries and businesses were stalled, and the banking industry also entered a period of depression. At the same time, it was also implicated in the financial collapse of the Beijing government, and the crisis became increasingly serious. The wind of bank failures became increasingly fierce. This situation gradually improved after the Nationalist Government established its capital in Nanjing in the 16th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Since the 17th year of the Republic of China, with the gradual return of politics to the right track and the gradual emergence of economic construction, the banking industry also developed along with the thriving of industry and commerce. In the 17th year, as many as fifteen new banks were established. In November of that year, the Central Bank was established. At the same time, there was also a reasonable adjustment to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The financial situation was renewed. The establishment of banks increased daily, while failures gradually decreased. From the 17th year to the 24th year, a total of 124 banks were established. During this period, on the one hand, the country encountered the "September 18th" Incident and the "January 28th" Incident. On the other hand, the country was affected by the US silver policy and the world economic panic. China's economy was extremely precarious. Fortunately, the banking industry was able to barely support itself by being self-reliant and establishing a relatively sound foundation early on. The implementation of the legal tender policy in November of the 24th year of the Republic of China enabled the national economy to recover and prosper, and the foundation of the banking industry became more stable. Although the establishment of new banks was not booming in the following two years, the foundation of the banking industry became increasingly solid, and there were signs of gradual improvement.</p>
<p>As of the end of June in the 25th year of the Republic of China, a total of 330 banks had been established in the country. A total of 166 had failed one after another. At that time, 164 existed. Branch institutions were established throughout the country, and at that time, there were already 1,332 units. The following is a list of the bank openings over the years as of the end of June in the 25th year:</p>
<p>Statistical Table of the Number of Banks Opened Each Year Since the 22nd Year of the Guangxu Reign</p>
<p>Source of Materials: National Bank Yearbook of the 25th Year</p>
<p>In the second half of the 25th year, one more bank was newly established. In the first half of the 26th year, three more were newly established. However, because banks were closed at the same time, the total number of banks as of the first half of the 26th year was still 164, and the number of branch institutions had expanded to 1,627.</p>
<p>At that time, commercial banks were the most numerous among the existing banks. After the 17th year, the provinces established provincial banks one after another. Agricultural and industrial banks also There is now a list of the classification of existing banks as of the end of June of the 25th Year: Statistical Table of the National Bank Classification as of the end of June of the 25th Year</p>
<p>Source of Materials: National Bank Yearbook of the 25th Year</p>
<p>From the second half of the 25th year to the eve of the War of Resistance in the 26th year, there was no significant change in the situation. Only commercial banks decreased by seven, and agricultural and industrial banks increased by five. Provincial, municipal, and overseas Chinese banks each increased by one.</p>
<p>(C) Progress During the War of Resistance: The "July 7th" War of Resistance broke out suddenly, and Shanghai was the battlefield. The financial center was hit hard, and the banking industry was in dire straits again. Fortunately, the authorities took appropriate measures, and the period of panic was very short. In the one or two years after the war, the banking industry re-boomed due to the prosperity of industry. For a time, new banks were established like bamboo shoots after rain, especially in the Great Rear Area. According to statistics, from the "July 7th" Incident in the 26th year to the end of August in the 31st year, as many as 108 new banks were established in the five years. Among them, commercial banks were still the most numerous, accounting for 62. The next most numerous were provincial, municipal, and county banks, accounting for 19. Agricultural and industrial banks accounted for 15, and specialized banks accounted for 9. After that, although the war situation changed repeatedly, the increase in the number of banks was still in full swing. As of the eve of victory at the end of August in the 34th year, the total number of banks in the rear area had reached 415, which was a considerable increase compared with the national figure before the war. Branch institutions numbered 2,566, which was also an increase compared with before, but the area of activity was only half of that before the war. From this, we can see a glimpse of the prosperity of the banking industry during the war. The following is a list of the classified quantities of national banks as of the end of August in the 34th year:</p>
<p>Statistical Table of the National Bank Classification as of the end of August in the 34th Year</p>
<p>Source of Materials: Statistics from the Business Inspection Department of Financial Institutions of the Central Bank</p>
<p>From the above table, it is worth noting the sharp increase in the branch institutions of state-run banks and provincial banks, as well as the increase in the establishment of county and city banks, which shows the government's efforts at that time to adjust financial institutions and develop the national economy.</p>
<p>As for the occupied areas, in addition to the many original commercial banks that continued to operate, there was also progress in quantity. Among the newly established banks, five major institutions were established by the enemy and puppet regime: one was the puppet "Huaxing Bank," with its headquarters in Shanghai; one was the puppet "Central Reserve Bank," with its headquarters in Nanjing; one was the puppet "China United Reserve Bank," with its headquarters in Peiping; one was the puppet "Mengjiang Bank," with its headquarters in Zhangjiakou; and one was the puppet "Central Bank of Manchuria," with its headquarters in Changchun. The number of general commercial banks also increased greatly. Taking Shanghai as an example, the total number on the eve of victory reached 193, which was more than three times the number before the war. Among these 193, in addition to a part established before the war, and more than 30 new banks established before the Pacific War in the 31st year and registered with the National Government, the remaining 120 new banks were not approved by the government. When victory came, they were ordered to be cleaned up. At that time, the number of banks in Shanghai was reduced to 73.</p>
<p>(D) Progress in the Early Post-War Period: With the end of the victory in the War of Resistance, the banking industry inherited the prosperity of the war period, and the number continued to increase, and the proportion of its increase was higher than in any previous period. The increase in the number of these banks was generally due to the needs of the environment. After the victory in the War of Resistance, the occupied areas were restored, and the banking business in various places had to be developed rapidly. Therefore, as of the end of December in the 35th year, the total number of banks in the country had reached 574, an increase of 158 compared with the time of victory a year earlier, and an increase of 410 compared with before the war. The number of branches was 2,996, an increase of 440 compared with a year earlier, and an increase of 1,369 compared with before the war. The following is a list of all the banks in the country classified as of the end of December in the 35th year:</p>
<p>Statistical Table of the National Bank Classification as of the end of December in the 35th Year</p>
<p>Source of Materials: Statistics from the Auditing Department of the Central Bank in the 35th Year</p>
<p>From the table above, it can be seen that the branch institutions of state-run banks have decreased slightly in the year or so since the victory. This was originally a normal phenomenon. After the victory and restoration, the people who were scattered in the Great Rear Area during the war returned to their hometowns one after another. Due to the change in the situation, the branch institutions had to be reasonably adjusted. Furthermore, in terms of provincial and municipal banks, the number is still increasing. Compared with before the war, the branch institutions of provincial banks have increased by 733. As for county and city banks, which were originally a new system that emerged during the war, they developed very little before the war. According to the statistics of the Central Bank in the 32nd year, as of the first half of the 26th year, the total number of county banks existing in the name of peasant banks, rural banks, and local banks was only 26 in the country. Now it has increased to 356.</p>
<p>The increase in the number of banks is not enough to accurately represent the degree of progress of the banking industry. However, the increase in the number of banks more or less indicates the needs of the economic society and industry and commerce for financial adjustment, that is, it more or less indicates the development of the strength of the silver industry.</p>

<h3>A Review of Foreign Pressure on Our National Transportation</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>Mr. Rong Yu Hu wrote an article entitled "China's Transportation in the Last Fifty Years" for this bank's commemorative publication. It is over ten thousand words long and is filled with reflections on the past and present. This article is just one section of it.</p>
<p>— Editor's Note —</p>
<p>The establishment of modern transportation in our country can be said to have been entirely dominated by foreign forces. This is because China's international status in the last hundred years has been only slightly better than that of a colony. The reason for this is admittedly self-inflicted, a fact that needs no concealment. Modern Western civilization was not easily accepted by Chinese customs. After thousands of years of isolation, once the sea was opened, China's poverty and weakness in the face of the great powers were fully revealed. However, old habits were hard to break, and there was no attempt at reform. The British built the Shanghai-Wusong Railway, but we destroyed it ourselves. Although the Tangshan-Xuge line of the Kaiping Coal Mine was built in the seventh year of the Guangxu reign, it was extended from Tianjin to Yu. The Beijing-Fengtian Railway was completed in the thirty-third year of the Guangxu reign, seven years after the Boxer Protocol. Therefore, compared with other countries at that time, their material construction progressed faster, while our backwardness became even more severe. As a result, the distance between countries in terms of wealth and power naturally grew further apart, and foreign pressure deepened daily, which was inevitable. When the oppression became too great, we sought self-renewal. Is this not the principle of extreme change, or what is meant by "sorrowful times enlighten the wise"? Afterward, major lines such as the Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, Shanghai-Nanjing, Zhengtai, Beijing-Suiyuan, Longhai, Jichang, and Guangdong-Hankou were built one after another. By the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, excluding the occupied Northeast region, the total length of domestic lines reached 11,400 kilometers. Considering the environment at the time, the progress was not slow. However, except for the Beijing-Suiyuan line, which was built entirely by domestic experts with domestic funds, the other roads built before the First World War were mostly built by borrowing foreign debt and hiring foreign engineers. Using foreign capital and talent to meet needs was not a bad practice in itself. However, the power to manage it had to be in our hands to be beneficial and harmless. However, that was not the case at the time. Because of the so-called "open door, equal opportunity" policy in diplomacy, the great powers such as Britain, France, Germany, and Japan competed for profit, relying on the coercion of unequal treaties to form a situation of so-called spheres of influence. Each took advantage of its convenience to obtain the right to invest in construction and operation. Even small and weak countries like the Netherlands and Belgium competed to get involved. Once the railway rights were ceded, borrowing funds to build a certain road had to be done from a certain country. Not only could we not change to another country, but other countries could not forcibly share the profits. The country with railway rights determined the speed of actual construction based on its own interests. Once the loan was established and the project began, the engineers were sent by that country, the materials were supplied by that country, and once the construction was completed, the transportation was operated by that country, and the profits were enjoyed by that country. Although our country appointed administrative leaders, they mostly just nodded and agreed. Only after the debt was repaid and the railway rights were redeemed could we operate independently. The conditions for repayment and redemption were harsh, to say the least. Therefore, the capital for the Beijing-Fengtian and Shanghai-Nanjing lines was borrowed from Britain, and the capital for the Beijing-Hankou line was borrowed from Belgium, which was the norm. The Tianjin-Pukou line was split into two sections. The southern section was connected to Shanghai-Nanjing, so it borrowed British funds, while the northern section was close to Qingdao and connected to the Jiaoji line, so it was contracted by the Germans. When the European War broke out, the Japanese army occupied Jiaozhou, and the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou line also fell into the hands of the Japanese along with the Jiaoji line. China's railways became property to be transferred and inherited based on the outcome of international wars. Looking back on the past, one can only feel sorrow and indignation. The First World War and the Russian Revolution left the Western European countries with no time to care about the affairs of the Far East, and Russia also had no time to look eastward. It was fortunate that it was able to maintain its rights and interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway. The United States was still adhering to the Monroe Doctrine at that time and rarely competed with the world. Although it participated in the European War, it withdrew immediately after winning. It only engaged in peaceful commercial warfare with China and had no aggressive ambitions, which allowed the friendship to last for a long time. Japan, on the other hand, took advantage of the situation to further its ambitions to dominate Asia. With the support of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, it used the South Manchurian Railway as a base to gradually encroach on the economic interests of the three northeastern provinces. It then further aimed at North China, which gradually led to the September 18th Incident. This was indeed due to the international situation, but our domestic political problems, the missed opportunities, and the failure to establish a sound economic foundation all affected the active development of transportation. The blame cannot be entirely placed on others. China was an Allied nation in the European War and refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles in Paris, which slightly increased its international status. After the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty and the establishment of our National Government, domestic thought gradually evolved, and the international community viewed us in a new light. Taking the redemption of railway rights as an example, we were able to refute harsh conditions and successfully take over the Zhengtai Railway with a reasonable and firm attitude. Although borrowing foreign debt to build new roads involved losses due to high interest rates and high material prices, we were able to break the previous bad practices in terms of major rights. In the ten years before the Anti-Japanese War, although we cannot say that everything was satisfactory, considerable achievements were made in the renovation of old roads and the construction of new roads.</p>
<p>As described above, the railway construction in the past fifty years is sufficient to give a glimpse of the influence of foreign diplomacy, and the losses and suffering caused by it have been enormous. As for water transport, it can be summarized in one sentence: the loss of shipping rights has made China's entire shipping industry like an infant with bone tuberculosis, with no way to grow. Telegraph submarine cables also fell into the hands of others, and after much effort, they were finally recovered. Future development still requires effort. The postal service was always managed by foreigners. Under the circumstances of simple land and water transportation, they were able to combine new and old transportation tools to plan operations and establish systems, so that at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, there were 72,000 post offices and 584,000 kilometers of postal routes in the country (excluding the occupied Northeast region at that time). Starting from its establishment in the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign, it had only been over thirty years. After being managed by the Chinese, it was able to follow the established rules and gradually develop, so that China Post could be compared with advanced countries. This is the only aspect in which foreign advisors have benefited us. As for highway and air transportation, they are emerging industries, and the international influence on them is still shallow, so I will not discuss them in detail here.</p>
<p>Today, after experiencing the Second World War, Germany and Japan, which were great powers in the past, have been defeated one after another. Today's great powers are working together to eliminate their aggressive thinking. China fought side by side with the world's democratic countries to resist violence, and the constraints of treaties in the past have been lifted. Whether the ideological tendencies of the major allies are left or right, they are now competing to call themselves democrats. If they are consistent in word and deed, open and honest, and trust and yield to each other to seek peace, then world security can be guaranteed, and the future of our country's construction should be bright. However, nearly two years have passed since the end of the war. Although the country's territory has been restored, looking north, there are still deep hidden worries. There have been repeated rumors of taking over Lushun and Dalian, but the facts have not been seen. The Changchun Railway has formed a joint management. Looking at the Northeast, our land, our people, our territory, and our management, is it possible to completely wipe away the past and renew the atmosphere? It is not easy to say. As for the abolition of all unfavorable treaties and the establishment of new treaties, which advocate mutual benefit and establish principles, it is indeed commendable. But how far is it from reality? Airplanes and ships come and go. Their planes have arrived, but where are our ships? Documents and books are used to enlighten the people, and new knowledge and skills are urgently needed to be imparted. What we have is not enough to benefit others, and what we need cannot be reprinted, so the source is blocked. Is this not what our people call "the phenomenon may be different, but the nature is the same"? Self-reliance and self-improvement, how can we not be vigilant? Among friendly countries, after the collapse of the Axis powers, the lessons of rise and fall cannot be ignored. The survival of the fittest, the strong survive and the weak decline, seems to be the ultimate truth. However, in terms of global nations, none are as cunning and brave as the Japanese, and none are as strong and persevering as the Germans. With their strong physique and sharp intelligence, they should have dominated the world. The battles of Stalingrad and Pearl Harbor made them think that they could control the world, but within a few years, they were on the verge of extinction. Afterward, India and Indonesia followed the Philippines in becoming independent and autonomous. The reason for this seems to be incomprehensible. Is it not because survival and freedom are the basic rights of mankind and cannot be forcibly taken away by violence? Twenty-five years ago, we said: "Whether our country will become the Balkans or not, its fate can only be decided by our country. Therefore, if our country can fight for a breath of air, it will bring infinite blessings to the world. Otherwise, the so-called Pacific problem, the Far East problem, and all kinds of problems will cause countless entanglements, and even if countless blood is shed, it will not be resolved. On the contrary, if our country can firmly establish itself, open its doors, and gather commerce and industry, the benefits enjoyed by other countries may be far greater than they are now, and the peace of the world can also be permanently maintained." Looking at the fierce international competition in recent times, these words seem to be still timely. Therefore, we hope that the people of our country can think carefully and make a clear distinction, and strive for self-renewal. We also hope that the leaders of the world's friendly countries can have a long-term vision, and with the spirit of benefiting others is benefiting oneself, cooperate and help each other to maintain world peace and share the benefits of mankind, which is not only beneficial to China's economic prosperity and transportation development.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Foreign Trade in the Last Fifty Years</h3>
<p>— Shou Jingwei</p>
<p>Dr. Shou Yicheng wrote an article entitled "China's International Trade in the Last Fifty Years" for this bank's commemorative publication. It is rich in materials and detailed in analysis. This article is the introduction to that article. — Editor's Note —</p>
<p>The trend of our country's foreign trade in the last fifty years can be divided into five periods.</p>
<p>1.  From 1895 to 1913, the period of losing tariff sovereignty and international competition for markets. During this period, both import and export trade increased greatly. Export trade increased from 140 million customs taels to 400 million customs taels, an increase of 186 percent. Import trade increased from 170 million customs taels to 570 million customs taels, an increase of 235 percent. There were two reasons for the rapid increase in foreign trade during this period. (1) Various countries obtained the convenience of establishing factories in China in accordance with the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, so the investment of Britain, France, and other countries in China increased sharply. At the same time, railway construction was at its peak during this period, and national industries were just starting, so the demand for foreign goods was very strong. (2) The number of treaty ports increased from 24 to 48 during this period. In particular, as a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, the Northeast became an important newly opened trade market in our country. The export of agricultural products from the Northeast increased greatly, and Japan gradually gained an advantage in China's trade.</p>
<p>2.  From the beginning of the First World War in 1914 to the outbreak of the Northeast Incident in 1931, the period of the budding of national industries and the outward expansion of trade. During this period, China's foreign trade continued to rise sharply. Export trade increased from 400 million customs taels to 900 million customs taels, an increase of 125 percent. Import trade increased from 450 million customs taels to 1.43 billion customs taels, an increase of 217 percent. The restoration of tariff autonomy was a major success after the establishment of the National Government.</p>
<p>3.  From the fall of the Northeast in 1932 to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, the period of rural economic panic and sharp decline in export trade. During this period, on the one hand, due to the economic panic around the world and the decline in productivity, our country's rural economy became increasingly poor. The purchasing power of the people was weak, and imports were affected. On the other hand, due to the loss of the Northeast, an important export area, exports tended to decline.</p>
<p>4.  From 1938 to 1945, the period of wartime trade control and trial of state-run trade. During this period, our country's foreign trade entered a wartime state, so the figures for foreign trade were actually very small and not worth mentioning. However, the active implementation of trade policies has epoch-making significance. The government completed the basic implementation in international trade and organized the Trade Commission. It established administrative agencies and formulated measures for the unified purchase and sale of export goods. It successively established the Fuhua Trading Company and the Fuxing Commercial Company. The Ministry of Economics then ordered the China Tea Company and the World Trading Company to be placed under its management to coordinate barter for materials. Advocating the state-run trade system was one of the most important aspects. On the other hand, Britain and the United States signed a new treaty with us in 1943, abandoning extraterritoriality and other rights and interests enjoyed in China, and the shackles that had been imposed on our national economy were thus removed. This is closely related to the development of postwar foreign trade.</p>
<p>5.  After 1946, the period of planning for postwar trade adjustment. This was the first year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Although the foreign war had ended, domestic peace had not yet been fully realized. As for export trade, due to transportation difficulties, agricultural products from the interior could not be transported to ports. Interest rates were too high, and costs were even higher, making it difficult to sell goods. Agriculture was mostly destroyed due to domestic wars, and the quantity of exported agricultural products also decreased. As for import trade, civilian goods that competed with national industries, such as paper and cotton, had particularly high import figures. The smuggling of luxury goods was even more rampant. Looking ahead, the worries are endless. The following is a table of the value of import and export trade in the last fifty years:</p>
<p>Statistical Table of Import and Export Trade Value in the Last Fifty Years (in millions)</p>
<p>Note: The figures for 1935-1946 are in national currency.</p>
<p>The conversion to US dollars is based on the exchange rate between customs taels or national currency and US dollars at the time. The conversion for 1946 is based on a ratio of 3350 to 1.</p>
<p>The national import and export figures for 1941 to 1944 were not published by the customs and could not be included.</p>

<h3>Prospects for Our National Finance in the Future</h3>
<p>— Jia Shiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Jia Guobai wrote an article entitled "China's Finance in the Last Fifty Years" for the commemorative publication "China's Economy in the Last Fifty Years" compiled by this bank. It is 15,000 words long and is rich in materials and detailed in analysis. This article is the conclusion of that article.</p>
<p>— Editor's Note —</p>
<p>The highest goal of finance is the balance of revenue and expenditure. To achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure, it is necessary to study the way of financial management. The so-called way of financial management is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The principle is simple, but how to implement it requires careful consideration. During the war, expenditure increased on the one hand and production decreased on the other hand, so it was inevitable that the balance of revenue and expenditure would be lost. Our government did its best to implement various measures to supplement the deficit, but most of them relied on currency issuance. Fortunately, China is an agricultural country, and the rear areas had bumper harvests every year. Even though there was inflation, it was still able to survive the darkest period. After the victory, due to the unstable domestic political situation, it was still difficult to balance revenue and expenditure. In addition to continuing to issue currency, other financial measures could not be put on the right track. However, it seems unfair to say that China's finance is hopeless. Based on my limited knowledge, I will briefly outline the following:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding revenue</p>
<p>A. Japan's compensation</p>
<p>Our country was the first country invaded by Japan and also suffered the most. Therefore, our country should have a large proportion of Japan's reparations and should have priority rights. The amount of this compensation is currently unknown, but it must be far greater than the value of enemy and puppet industries confiscated in the country. Although most of this compensation is in the form of production equipment, our country's biggest difficulty at present is still the lack of materials. If we obtain a large amount of new production equipment, we can accelerate production and solve the problem of material shortage, which can indirectly reduce the financial burden. This is one.</p>
<p>B. Sale of state-owned enterprises</p>
<p>The emergency economic measures adopted on February 17, 1947, included plans to sell state-owned enterprises. State-owned enterprises have a scope. If the scope of state-owned enterprises is expanded due to financial reasons, the increase in financial revenue will not be equal to the loss in the economic aspect. The economy is the lifeblood of finance. If the economy declines, finance will also shrink. Therefore, the sale of state-owned enterprises is not only a large income in finance, but also has a good impact on the entire national economy. Developing the national economy and enhancing the people's ability to pay taxes is the most reliable way to open up revenue sources. This is two.</p>
<p>C. Expansion of direct tax collection</p>
<p>Direct taxes are good taxes, and most economically advanced countries list them as the most important source of national revenue. Since the introduction of direct taxes in our country, although revenue has increased annually, the scope covered is not wide. Taking income tax as an example, it is only collected by category, and the investigation and statistics are not detailed enough, so it is still far from ideal. Direct taxes are an important source of tax revenue for our country in the future. If they can be effectively implemented and expanded, the balance of revenue and expenditure will be greatly assisted. This is three.</p>
<p>D. Surplus of transportation enterprises</p>
<p>The surplus of transportation enterprises was originally an important item in our country's annual revenue. Since the Anti-Japanese War, in order to stabilize prices, the prices of transportation enterprises have mostly been below cost, and they are difficult to maintain without subsidies. Therefore, transportation enterprises at present not only do not help the national treasury, but also are a major financial burden. However, this situation is only temporary. In the future, when the country's important railway trunk lines are completed and the economy along the line is greatly developed, the income of transportation enterprises will still be a very reliable source of national revenue. This is four.</p>
<p>E. Income from barter</p>
<p>Judging from the general trend, the complete freedom of international trade is not possible in the short term. Our country was originally an industrially backward country and suffered heavy losses in the war. The management of trade will continue. In addition to import restrictions, the government should centrally purchase and export our country's special products, which will directly increase foreign exchange income and indirectly supplement financial expenditure. This is five.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding expenditure</p>
<p>A. Abolish unnecessary institutions</p>
<p>During the war, due to environmental needs, many central and local institutions were added. Although some have been abolished after the end of the war, many still remain. This not only affects administrative efficiency, but also increases national expenditure. The concentration of talent in cities is even more detrimental to the development of townships. In the future, all unnecessary institutions should be abolished to save national funds.</p>
<p>B. Stop unnecessary projects</p>
<p>In addition to abolishing unnecessary institutions, the next step should be to stop unnecessary projects. In all fairness, the government has given careful consideration to many of the projects it has undertaken, but many have also been carried out in accordance with the environment and established practices. This will inevitably constitute a waste of finance. At a time when the country's finances are riddled with holes, all unnecessary projects should be completely stopped.</p>
<p>C. Stop expenditures that should not be borne by the national treasury</p>
<p>This type of expenditure, whether public or not, should be removed from the national treasury's expenditure.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the application of fiscal policy</p>
<p>A. Coordination of fiscal policy and economic policy</p>
<p>It is known to everyone that finance cannot be separated from the economy. Therefore, in the future, finance should avoid depleting the pond to catch fish and destroying the tax source in terms of revenue. In terms of expenditure, it should be directly and indirectly applied to production, so that the effect of taxes becomes reproductive.</p>
<p>B. Coordination of fiscal policy and social policy</p>
<p>"Take from the people, use for the people" was the earliest theory of finance. However, from a modern point of view, this theory is not perfect. It must be that taking from the people should be based on the principle of equality, and using for the people should be based on the principle of universality. Restrict the concentration of property, so that there is no gap between rich and poor, and improve the standard of living, so that the masses can live in comfort and happiness. The way to apply fiscal policy lies in this.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Insurance Industry Over the Past Fifty Years</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaowen</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaowen has contributed an article entitled "The Chinese Insurance Industry Over the Past Fifty Years" to our bank's commemorative publication. The content is rich and the writing elegant. The following is its introduction. – Editor’s Note –</p>
<p>The beginning of the Kingly Way lies in enabling the people to live well and pass away without regrets. Mencius spoke of this more than two thousand years ago. With the rise of insurance systems, a path to the Kingly Way has been opened. Human life is finite, and the world is impermanent. Only by planning for the aftermath in our remaining years can we secure funds for medical care and funerals, and prevent the lonely and widowed from being left without support. This is how life insurance can ensure a passing without regrets. Only by preparing for dangers in times of peace and prosperity can we secure ourselves against war, fire, and water damage, drawing from external resources and looking forward to recovery. This is how property insurance can ensure a life without regrets. By paying a minimal price, one obtains vast financial security. From the perspective of the insured, insurance is truly a social welfare undertaking. Insurance does not guarantee that danger will necessarily occur, nor does it guarantee that danger will necessarily not occur. It only guarantees that, should the insured object suffer economic loss due to danger, appropriate compensation will be provided. The laws of probability are inherently uncertain. Pooling idle funds from the populace and increasing substantial capital allows for investments in construction, which can enrich the nation. Confucius said, "When the people are sufficient, with whom would the ruler be insufficient?" Therefore, the development of the insurance industry is truly a primary source of the nation's capital. From the perspective of the insurance industry, insurance is deeply and profoundly connected to the national economy. In today's world, the insurance businesses of Britain and America are renowned for their robust capital. Britain is a pioneer and continues to hold the reins of the global fire insurance industry. The United States' life insurance business accounts for over 70% of the world's total. As for a new system that has captured global attention, none is more prominent than that of Soviet Russia. The scope of the Soviet insurance system is even broader than that of various capitalist nations, further demonstrating that the insurance industry is not a capitalist organization pursuing profit, but rather an institution that supports social welfare, promotes social health, strives for the well-being of the people, and assists in economic construction. Looking back at our own country, what is the situation? A review of China's insurance industry over the past fifty years is indispensable. By learning from the past, we can know the future, and perhaps this can aid in its advancement.</p>
<p>Did our country have what we consider an insurance system in ancient times? Books and records are scarce, and I dare not speculate to satisfy my own assumptions. Based on what can be verified, China's insurance industry began over a hundred years ago with the Union Insurance Society of Canton Ltd. in Hong Kong in 1835 (Qing Daoguang Year 15) and the Canton Insurance Office, Ltd. the following year. Regrettably, both companies were operated by British merchants, and the Chinese people had a vague understanding of the insurance business. In 1843 (Daoguang Year 20), the Treaty of Nanjing was established, and Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ningbo, Xiamen, and Fuzhou were simultaneously opened as trading ports. British merchant power grew daily, and Shanghai's city conditions gradually prospered. In 1846 (Daoguang Year 26), British merchants established the Standard and Oriental companies in Shanghai to conduct life insurance. In 1862 (Tongzhi Year 1), the North China and Yangtse companies were established to conduct fire and marine insurance. Chinese merchants were unable to compete effectively. China's insurance industry truly began in 1885 (Guangxu Year 11) with the Renhe and Jihe insurance companies (now merged into Renjihe Insurance Company), the first attempts by Chinese merchants to independently operate fire and marine insurance. However, fifty years had passed since the establishment of Union Insurance, meaning that our Chinese insurance industry had been monopolized by foreign merchants for fifty years. In this first period of fifty years, China had virtually no insurance to speak of, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>I have always believed that a nation as impoverished as ours cannot achieve wealth and power without utilizing foreign capital. However, utilizing foreign capital in productive enterprises is acceptable, while allowing our national capital to be utilized by foreigners is absolutely unacceptable. Foreign investment in productive enterprises can aid our construction and revitalize our nation, but allowing our national capital to be utilized by foreigners will ultimately have the opposite effect. The insurance business absorbs the wealth of the people. If it were entirely operated by foreigners, how could this meager national strength not drift away on foreign ships? Our nation would inevitably lament being tied to the sang tree, unable to escape. After 1885 (Guangxu Year 11), enlightened individuals in our country seemed to have recognized this. From 1885 (Guangxu Year 11) to 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), Chinese merchants did their utmost to develop and cultivate the insurance business in order to compete with foreign merchants. The following is a table listing the insurance companies established by Chinese merchants during this second period of fifty years:</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, 53 insurance companies were established in China during the second fifty-year period. 13 companies ceased operations, leaving 40 companies still existing as of 1936 (Republic of China Year 24). The following tables further illustrate their nature and distribution:</p>
<p>(A) Nature of Organization</p>
<p>(B) Geographical Distribution (Based on Headquarters Location)</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding foreign insurance businesses, according to statistics at the end of 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), six had headquarters in Shanghai and six in Hong Kong. The number of branch offices and agencies was even greater. The following is a breakdown by nationality of all foreign insurance businesses with headquarters, branch offices, and agencies in China:</p>
<p>Number by Nationality</p>
<p>United Kingdom 76</p>
<p>United States 23</p>
<p>Japan 14</p>
<p>Germany 9</p>
<p>France 8</p>
<p>Netherlands 11</p>
<p>Australia 4</p>
<p>Canada 3</p>
<p>Switzerland 2</p>
<p>Italy 2</p>
<p>Norway 1</p>

<h3>How to Utilize Government Bond Policy</h3>
<p>— Chen Bingzhang</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, has contributed an article entitled "China's Public Debt Over the Past Fifty Years" to our bank's commemorative publication. It is over ten thousand words long, rich in content, and statistically detailed, making it a highly valuable historical record. The following section contains the conclusion of that article.</p>
<p>— Editor’s Note —</p>
<p>In reviewing the general state and achievements of China's public debt policy over the past fifty years, and in order to encourage future progress, it is necessary to conduct an objective study of how to strengthen the utilization of public debt policy in the future. I will now offer my humble opinions on the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Coordinating with National Fiscal and Economic Policies: The primary sources of wartime funding are nothing more than increased taxes, bond issuance, and increased currency issuance. Among these, increasing currency issuance is the most dangerous. In recent years, currency inflation and high prices have led to widespread hardship and industrial decline. Therefore, to compensate for financial shortfalls in the future, we should utilize public debt policy and not rely solely on increasing currency issuance. In particular, we should coordinate with national economic policies. Economic policy should aim to enrich the people, allowing them to accumulate wealth. Then, the government will naturally have a source of revenue. This is the fundamental solution and the true way to generate income.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing Government Creditworthiness: The government issues public debt to supplement its own shortcomings, taking from the people and using it for the people. However, the key lies in the word "credit." If the government acts in a way that betrays the people's trust, it will be difficult to sell public bonds and even more difficult to borrow foreign debt. Therefore, before the war of resistance, financial authorities made establishing creditworthiness their motto, and the issuance of debt proceeded smoothly. This was not an unwise measure. In the future, the government should resolve to make a fresh start with the people and gradually find ways to restore its credibility.</p>
<p>(3) Improving Bond Issuance Methods: The issuance of public debt should raise funds from the public to directly absorb people's savings. If the Bank of Communications provides mortgage loans, it is tantamount to increasing currency issuance, negating the meaning of issuing public debt. After the establishment of the National Government in 1927 (Republic of China Year 16), various public debts were still largely adopted through mortgage methods. Although the method of widespread public subscription was adopted during the war of resistance, it did not achieve significant results due to various obstacles. The method of apportionment was particularly prone to abuses, causing widespread complaints among the people. In the future, we should avoid bank mortgages on the one hand and improve direct sales methods to the public on the other, striving for widespread and open procedures, cultivating the habit of free public subscription, and truly achieving the goal of absorbing idle social capital.</p>
<p>(4) Establishing a Public Debt Market: Public debt is a type of negotiable security. In principle, it should be allowed to circulate freely. During the war of resistance, the financial center shifted to the rear, but the securities market was not fully developed, preventing bonds from being publicly and freely traded. Although the Shanghai Stock Exchange reopened last September, post-war finances have not been stable, and the Shanghai market has seen many abnormal developments. The listing of public debt requires careful consideration. In the future, when market conditions improve, the government should set a time to allow public debt to be listed and traded, establishing a public market and regulating finance.</p>
<p>(5) Defining the Principles and Purposes of Borrowing: Foreign borrowing should be based on the fundamental principles of equality and mutual benefit, without harming national interests. Its purpose should be limited to economic construction, especially the expenses of various undertakings stipulated in industrial plans. The purpose of domestic debt should also be clearly defined and supervised by representative bodies. It should also be determined that the Ministry of Finance is the unified agency for debt management, which is sufficient to achieve the effect of utilization and control. In the past, various ministries and commissions contacted foreign countries for loans on their own, leading to disorganized procedures and a lack of overall consideration. In the future, the Ministry of Finance should be the sole agency for foreign borrowing.</p>
<p>(6) Establishing a Comprehensive Plan for Foreign Loans: The Premier's industrial plan lists many things that should be done, but they cannot all be done simultaneously. They should be prioritized in order of importance and urgency. A comprehensive plan should be developed to determine which should come first and which should come later. Each agency that needs materials should prepare a business plan and a list of the types and quantities of materials needed, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for compilation and approval of the overall plan. In the future, loans should be negotiated and allocated to foreign countries by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the agencies in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>(7) Control over the Use of Loans and Finances: The failure of foreign debt in the past was often due to the misuse of funds and the waste of finances, resulting in the failure of undertakings and the inability to repay debts, which harmed the national economy and the people's livelihood. If the Premier's industrial plan is implemented, it will require vast amounts of money. Therefore, strict measures must be taken to audit the use of foreign debt for each undertaking and to control financial expenditures. This should be done by the competent authorities, the Ministry of Finance, and related agencies, which should organize a financial supervision institution to carry out the responsibilities of auditing and disbursement, and to establish business ties.</p>
<p>The above points are the essential outline of public debt policy. If we borrow based on this policy, encouraging savings, absorbing funds, promoting construction, increasing production, stabilizing finances, balancing the budget, regulating foreign trade, and improving people's lives, then everyone will use their talents, everything will be used to its fullest extent, the land will be used to its fullest potential, and goods will flow smoothly. Thus, the source of wealth will increase daily, the national use will always be sufficient, and the use of public debt policy will be essential to the construction of China's finance and economy.</p>

<p>Appendix: A Chronicle of Major Financial and Economic Events in China Over the Past Fifty Years</p>
<h3>Current Status of the Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>— Luo Qinghua</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications has been in existence for fifty years since its establishment. Regarding the history of its reforms and changes during these fifty years, Chairman Du Yuesheng has already recorded a general account. Now, I will briefly describe its current situation.</p>
<p>Organizational System</p>
<p>The organizational system of our bank is nominally a head office system, but in reality, it is a general management office system. The purpose is to adopt the advantages of both and eliminate their disadvantages. Since its trial implementation, it has achieved significant results. The internal organizational system of our bank is listed below:</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance in 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), our bank has seven official shareholder directors and four commercial shareholder directors; three official supervisor directors and two commercial shareholder supervisors, for a total of sixteen directors and supervisors. The current directors and supervisors are:</p>
<p>Branch Institutions</p>
<p>In the past, during Mr. Sheng Xuanhuai's leadership, the branch institutions of our bank were distributed not only throughout the country but also as far as Singapore and Hong Kong. Later, due to mismanagement by the leaders and the poor performance of the business, it only extended to the southeastern corner. Since Chairman Du Yuesheng took office in 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), he has worked diligently to govern and has shown signs of revitalization. It is expected that it will not be difficult to restore the old appearance in the short term. The current distribution of head offices and branch institutions and their responsible persons are listed below:</p>
<p>Personnel System</p>
<p>Since the restoration, our bank has been fully promoting its business. Last summer, we publicly recruited staff and students and trained them. The purpose is to enrich the knowledge and skills of staff members, improve their service ethics, and cultivate sound cadres. As a result of the examination, a total of sixty people were admitted and trained in two phases. The first phase has already been completed and assigned to positions; the second phase is currently in training.</p>
<p>The training method is divided into the following three categories:</p>
<p>A. Internship: Trainees are assigned to various internship offices in accordance with actual needs. During business hours, they are guided by the supervisors of each office and rotate through various departments to gain a concept of the following work activities: 1. Document Department (1) Receiving and dispatching (2) Drafting (3) Editing (4) Archiving; 2. Accounting Department (1) Copying and reporting (2) Recording the general ledger (3) Recording the inter-bank account and measuring funds (4) Reviewing (5) Balancing the account; 3. Business Department (1) Deposits (2) Loans (3) Remittances (4) Exchanges (5) Exchanges (6) Fellow traders; 4. Cash Department (1) Receipts (2) Payments; 5. Savings Department.</p>
<p>B. Academic Training: Trainees follow the prescribed time to attend lectures in the training classroom daily. The subjects are: banking business, banking accounting, commercial calculation, financial regulations, financial markets, personnel and administrative management, documentation, and commercial English.</p>
<p>C. Spiritual Training: Senior executives of our bank serve as lecturers, and special experts are invited to give lectures. These are held once every other week, and trainees take notes during the lectures. In addition, trainees submit a daily work diary, the content of which is limited to: 1. Internship situation, 2. Work progress, feelings and experiences, 3. Lecture summary, 4. Suggestions for improvement or enhancement, 5. Reading questions, 6. Views on financial and economic trends, etc.</p>
<p>Business Overview</p>
<p>After the victorious end of the war, the domestic and foreign financial and economic situation has instantly unfolded a new page. Due to the abnormal financial and economic conditions created by the extraordinary wartime environment, it is not easy to clear up for a while, and there are thorns ahead that need to be overcome. The unprecedented economic tide is now coming with the victory, and all industries, commerce, finance, etc. throughout the country are shaken by wind and rain, and are in danger of not being able to last for a long time! Fortunately, our bank has the long history of serving the society in the past, as well as the new spirit nurtured by the times in recent years, and it is still able to prepare for the worst and respond to the opportunity to strive hard.</p>
<p>The business overview of our bank since the victory is described as follows:</p>
<p>1. Deposits: In wartime economy, there are many special morbidities, and the psychology of general depositors has mostly changed, and idle funds are mostly not passed through the bank. Our bank adheres to its position, and the absorption of deposits is normal, and does not compete with the black market. The main countermeasure is to promote the establishment of credit and improve service efficiency. The number of deposits can still maintain a considerable level. At the end of the European war, we strengthened the replenishment of deposit reserves and fully stored cash, waiting to cope with it. Therefore, when the gold rush and the withdrawal of depositors after the victory, we were able to respond calmly and were not affected, and the deposits in each bank increased instead. In Shanghai, due to the exchange of counterfeit currency, there were also more deposits. As for savings deposits, it is not easy to absorb them due to the depression of people's livelihood after the war, but in order to promote thrift, they are still held, but the effect is not obvious.</p>
<p>2. Loans: In recent years, industrial and mining production has been shrinking, commercial capital has been expanding too fast, and the trend of speculation and hoarding has intensified. The use of funds in various industries has no seasonality, and the lending objects of silver and money industries have gradually lost their basis. Under the conditions of legality and safety, our bank's loans still focus on short-term, flexible, tight credit, emphasize pledges, customers strive for dispersion, and collateral is easy to sell, especially those that can be re-mortgaged and re-discounted. For example, salt blocks in Zigong, coal in Weiyuan, wool, leather, medicinal herbs, and water tobacco, which are special products of the Northwest, are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and we have devoted ourselves to supporting them. Before the situation took a sharp turn for the worse, our bank had prepared in advance to tighten loans and recover debts from old customers. Therefore, even when the market was in a state of urgency and the silver and money industries were in a state of anxiety, we did not have to worry about it in an emergency. The funds required were fully adjusted by the Chongqing and Chongqing banks, and no loans were borrowed from the central banks in various places. This shows that our bank's use of funds strives for prudence. After the victory, the market did not return to normal, and most of the industry peers were in a wait-and-see state. Our bank still selected customers with good credit and gave them loans to avoid dark consumption.</p>
<p>3. Remittances: Our bank is keen on operating remittances. All cash adjustments such as cash transportation, purchase and sale of foreign exchange are done to the best of our ability, and we entrust industry peers in various places to sign agency collection contracts to actively expand the remittance network. Since the victory and restoration, the price difference between Shanghai and the mainland has been huge, and funds have flowed east for a while. Our bank seized the opportunity and first applied to commercial banks to apply for remittances, which was convenient for customers. The surplus obtained from the remittances was enough to offset the losses caused by the contraction of loans and the restoration expenses after the end of the war.</p>
<p>4. Profit and Loss: Regarding the profit and loss situation in the last year, the income is mainly from interest, and the expenses are due to the continued rise in prices. Only the early stage of the victory was slightly stable, and the restoration expenses accounted for most of the expenses. Fortunately, we were able to work hard to save money and did not exceed the limit. The final settlement at the end of the year was still profitable.</p>
