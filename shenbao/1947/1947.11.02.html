<h3>對日和會召開無期　我盼早日打開僵局　王外長招待記者時談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電﹞由美歸來未久之外長王世杰，一日上午十一時公開答覆各記者所提有關外交之問題，惟對美國援華一事則守口如瓶，拒絕有所透露。今日之招待會，係王氏返國首次舉行者。事先各報記者書面提出問題多起，尤着重於美援華問題，王氏則作綜合之答覆。渠所答覆者，與渠在政務會議及國務會議席上之報吿大致相似。關於美援華事，記者所提之問題，擬獲知援華辦法及美方「監督」之條件。王氏答覆時僅稱：「關於美援華問題，余不擬作何聲明。此種問題，似應向華盛頓提出。」其後，王氏對各記者之口頭詢問，亦予答覆。</p>
<p>王氏希望與論界特別重視中印兩國在國際會議中之合作。渠於叙述聯合國大會情形後稱，此次大會，印度係首次以完全獨立國之資格出席。在過去一個多月中，印度代表團與中國代表團，在若干重要問題上，均非常融洽。目前聯大各會員國，均各有其集團，惟中國孤立。如中印意見完全一致，在國際會議上，對若千重大問題採取協議，則此代表八億人民之兩大國家，雖非具有强大武力之國家，其聯合意見，對世界和平，必可發生決定性之力量。故本人盼各方重視中印合作，以此合作爲世界和平服務。</p>
<p>關於對日和會問題，王氏稱：對日和約起草會議，何時可以召開，現在尙不能推斷。渠解釋此事之癥結，在於美蘇意見之兩歧，美方主張開十一國會議，蘇方主張中。英。美。蘇會商，我方之提議爲應由十一國會議起草，但每一決定，必須中美英蘇一致同意。目前我正待美蘇兩方對我提議之答覆，並仍督促美蘇接受我方主張。「如果雙方中任何一方不接受中國之提議，余實不悉尙有何法打開目前僵局，成立和約。」有人詢以如美蘇不接受我方提議，則我方態度如何？王氏答稱：「余現不願作任何聲明，因余不願假定我國主張不被接受也。」王氏續稱：「目前聯合國間之空氣日趨緊張，此種形勢在對德對日和約未締結以前，恐難望好轉。就此兩大和約言，對日和約之成立，較對德和約爲易，如能早日完成對日和約，樹立遠東和平，世界大勢或可以開始好轉，故中國不願見對日和會問題久懸不決。」</p>
<p>王外長在部大禮堂招待記者時情形（中央社攝）</p>
<h3>我向聯合國大會建議　限制濫用否決權　韓國問題我贊同美蘇同時撤兵</h3>
<p>關於聯合國大會情形，王氏提出數重要問題，就我國立塲加以說明：　五强否決權問題：我國對否決權之使用至爲愼重過去二年，從未使用一次。大會中有主張修改憲章，取消否決權者，事實上不易辦到，亦不妥當，故我國不予贊同。我方對此曾有獨立提案，主張在憲章範圍內限制否決權之濫用，此項提議，若干國家表示贊成，可能於下週會議中提出討論。　常設委員會問題：此事蘇方反對甚力，我方主張該委會可以設立，但不能代替大會，亦不能侵犯安理會職權，此一意見，似爲極大多數贊同，但蘇方仍可能反對。　韓國問題：原定九月八日召開中。美。英。蘇四國會議討論，因蘇方反對而中止，故美國在大會中提出。我國認爲如美蘇或參加莫斯科協定之中。美。英。蘇四國不能成立協議，此問題自可提出大會討論。中國贊同美蘇同時撤兵，惟撤兵前如不能成立負資維持全國秩序與代表韓國人民之政府，則撤兵之日，將立陷韓國於無政府或內亂之狀態，故撤兵時間與撤兵前之工作，宜由聯合國徵詢四國意見決定。</p>
<h3>管制日本　麥帥並未放鬆</h3>
<p>關於日本情形，王氏稱：「余在日僅四天，與各方晤見，並作長談，以余個人觀之，片山哲內閣確有誠意領導日人走上和平民主之路，惟日人似尙無高度熱誠以應付民主政治，如日本領袖人物能培植此種熱誠，日本前途始有保障。麥克阿瑟將軍對日管制未放鬆，其根本政策亦未改變，惟彼對日本人民現在及未來之飢餓，非常憂慮，故採取若干步驟，預防日本人民現在及將來所受之經濟成脅。</p>
<p>王氏報吿達三十五分鐘之久，其後有人詢以旅大問題，王氏稱：此事應由中美雙方使節在蘇京及南京交涉。渠謂，今日未準備談及此項問題，故不作答。</p>
<h3>我贈伊麗沙白賀禮　託交英訪華團轉致</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京一日電﹞我國政府贈送英皇儲伊麗沙白公主大婚盛典之賀禮（江西名瓷器皿三大箱），業由我外部於一日送交英大使館，並託由英訪華團携運倫敦，轉致英國皇室。是項禮瓷共一七五件，包括茶杯碟廿四套，咖啡大牛奶壺，糖皿各一具，九吋湯鉢三四個，九吋。八吋。六吋。四吋菜碟各廿四個，橢圓形菜碟四個，係贛瓷造成，在景德鎭監製，精繪愼燒，費時一個半月完工，全部値達法幣三千萬元。</p>
<h3>首批賠償物資　我正監督包裝</h3>
<p>﹝中央社東京一日電﹞我駐日賠償代表團巳着手監督包裝九千四百四十七部機器及工具，該批物資爲提前移交賠償物資中輸華之第一批，起運賠償裝備之確實日期雖尙未決定，中國代表業在東京及本州之仙牽準備料理起遝賠償物資之初步事宜。（下接二版一欄）</p>
<h3>守北塔山官兵　榮獲行轅獎章</h3>
<p>〔本報西寗卅一日電﹞堅守北塔山之靑海騎七旅官兵，除殲敵致勝外，並獲敵方重要文件多種，指揮官馬吉祥經轉呈後，西北行轅特頒發陸海空軍獎章多種，以昭激勵，典禮在烏拉斯草原舉行。</p>
<h3>日本對盟國賠償問題　王外長談兩原則　軍事工業設備皆須解體移除　經濟則使建立自給自足基礎</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京一日電﹞外長王世杰，一日午於外記者招待會中，答覆關於日本賠償問題稱：在戰爭期間，日本之侵略行爲，使中國蒙受慘重之損失，巾國政府自當根據事實，提出適當之賠償要求。王氏並未正面答覆記者之問題，說明中國所求之最低限度百分比。渠稱：有關賠償之數額及方式諸問題，中國與美國以及其他盟國間，並無根本之不同，均一致認爲日本之軍事工業及可能改爲軍事工業之設備皆須解體，並移除之，同時，並可使日本經濟建立於自給自足之礎上。目前賠償問題需研究者，爲如何使此兩原則並行不悖，至於如何使中國及其他關係盟國所作之賠償要求相互協調，分配合理，乃次要之事。王氏稱：中國要求叢獲琉球主權，然對是否保留美軍在該羣島之軍事設備一點，拒絕答覆。</p>
<h3>日賠償數額　我應佔最大多數</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京一日電﹞關於我國對日本賠償問題之主張，據消息靈通方面稱：其數額「最少」爲百分之四十，蓋視上次大戰後法國自德國取得百分之五十二之賠償總額一例言之，若干朝野人士認爲，百分之四十有欠公平，戰爭所摧毀者，殆太半在我國也，故我關係當局對此項數額迄無決定之宣佈。我國認爲，生產設備及生產品，均應作賠償全體，並堅主賠償義務之履行須有保證，由盟國對日監督機構予以強制執行。至於日本政府或人民對外之債權及產業，如其本質係因直接或間接遂行其侵略目的而為，應一律無條件沒收，而與賠償毫無關係，此亦爲我國朝野專家所一致確定者。</p>
<h3>物資供應委會　出售物資原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院物資供應委員會對今後物資之出售，已決定下列各項原則：　對於政府機關所需物資，廉價供應。　對於一般民生消費品，仍採用特約分銷制，其出售價格，隨時參照市價，評議商定。　爲使工業界能受實惠及防止此類物資流入中間商人之手，過去之標售方式，有待改善者甚多，有關各單位正奉命研討詳細辦法，短期內即可公布實施。</p>
<h3>郵政總局長　霍錫祥交卸　出國任國際郵會我理事</h3>

<h3>英訪華團返京　盛讚台灣工業</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕英訪華團一行六人，乘自强號專機，遍遊平。津。杭。滬。台。漢及重慶後，一日下午三時二十分安返首都。亞蒙勳爵等對此次長途遊歷，至表快慰，哈里遜對各地紡織事業，印象至佳，並概論台灣之工業如善爲經營，必有興盛之前途。哈氏對古風之北平，譽不絕口，並謂重慶爲一奇異之城市，其重霧令彼等頓憶倫敦云。該團定二日上午十時在國際聯歡社招待記者，十一時再訪張院長辭行，十二時訪主外長，並將在官邸午宴。二日下午五時，該團假國際聯歡社舉行鷄尾酒會，款待各界人士，晚由印度梅農大使爲彼等餞行，三日離京飛穗，逗留三天後轉港返英。</p>
<h3>國府首次月會　張院長報吿治合方針</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京一日電〕國府一日舉行首次月會，張院長出席報吿視察台灣感想，首述台省地理。民族，認爲皆係中國之一部分，並盛譽台灣同胞之民族精神，認爲係中國歷史文化陶鑄的結果。今後中國欲保持爲大國，永久屹立於世界，亦持此歷史文化之力量作爲基礎。至於日本在台灣之建設，無論政治，敎育，經濟，皆止半截，上層政洽皆在日人之手。敎育方面，不讓台人有高深文哲政治思想，亦不讓有高深科學技術，止讓多多學醫而已。經濟上日人祗負指導之責，事實上其基礎皆爲我台灣同胞所造成。張氏繼言及政府今後治台方針，政治上利用旣有基礎，注意配合關係，不可輕予更張。敎育上使台灣靑年多得受大學敎育機會。經濟上，台灣資源不足以建立區域自足經濟，台灣經濟計劃，必須與全國經濟計劃相配合。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　對學術獨立問題之我見</h3>
<p>— 樊德芬</p>
<p>在這戰火燎原社會動盪的時期中，時代的浪灣上又湧現出學術獨立的問題，自是性質複雜，事非偶然。自從胡適之先生晨鷄初唱，提出建議，一時學術界紛起響應，就此問題抒陳意見。不但打破了學術界不常討論具體問題的沉寂空氣，且正表示出學術界救危圖存的一種嚴重呼聲。雖各人對於胡先生建議的內容，見仁見智，不能盡同，但足見這個問題却是建設國家的重大問題之　。理應廣集竟見，詳為考慮。</p>
<p>作者以為凡百問題脫離不了時代及環境的關係，這一問題的討論，須先覓取我國現在時代環境的透視。我國抗戰八年，凋零殘破，元氣大傷，招致學術上的重大厄運。這種厄運本可希望隨着抗戰之勝利而得以挽回，先之以補苴罅漏，繼之以轉弱爲强。但共產黨叛亂稱兵，隨着抗戰結束而來的，卻是更爲艱苦的歲月，反而將學術上的厄運增强加甚。號稱最高學府的大學依舊是一種難民收容所的形狀；學術工作者窮困不改，終日瑣忙，既無充分的時間和優閒的環境以治學深造，又喪失了社會的尊嚴，幾乎走到了窮途末路。學術的事業，也如其他事業一樣，本是寄托在中年人身上的，此輩中年人因遭受抗戰時期的摧殘，學殖未能精進，而勝利以後，又不能急起直追。試問學術的工作責任，將依賴何人負荷？所以，「窮」實爲摧殘學術的嚴　。</p>
<p>抗戰時期的敎育，還有一種奇特現象，那就是一方面窮困，一方面膨脹。大中學的數目增加了，各校學生的人數也增加了，這固然因爲適應當時抗戰的環境，鑒於各省流亡到大後方學生數量之多，各地學校流離播遷之眾，不能不因時制宜，使大批靑年學子有所歸宿，但終不免於貪多務博，重量忽質，遂流爲粗製濫造，放低水準，這究竟於發揚文化，提高學術，恰是背道而馳。治兵之道，尙且是貴精而不貴多；何況艱難高深像學術那樣的事？以前我國的讀書人可謂數目甚少，但以前的天子尊賢，社會　學，是以學術深邃之士，卻代有其人。以我國現在之貧弱，若只知從增加大中學的數目上來粉飾進步，自不免减低學術向上提高的機能。自然，以現有的數目拿來與歐美富强的大國家相比較，尙覺得瞠乎其後。但既已凡百不如人，自應作根本之計，何必在這種表面上來爭取顏而於一時？若言掃除文盲，則應發展增加者，母寗祗是小學敎育，而未必是大學校。而且社會事樂不發達，舊社會紳士的傳統尙濃厚，大批的大學畢業生實苦於無地容納，弄到不好，徒製造了一批一批的高等遊民，始終只想在政治舞台上去混，加重了肚會不安的情况。</p>
<p>若照現在的情形長此推演下去，不加糾正，則大學將名存實亡，不復成爲大學。適之先生的建議，雖打着學術獨立的旗號，似乎是積極的性質，然核之實際，實是一種消極的救危　存的辦法。他的正面文章是按期特別發展幾個大學，但若從反面去看，就等於想淘汰若干大學。因爲不發展，就將每況愈下，無以自存；不淘汰，就無以集中精力，使適者生存。必使優良的適者有所救濟，而後方能使之穩定，能穩定而後有發展，有發展而後能走上學術獨立的道路。至於那幾個大學是「適者」，那幾個大學或專系專科是今日中國所應首先充實發展的，自是另一個問題。</p>
<p>時間依然是一個重要因素。我們從整理大學起以至於學術獨立，在時間上，恐怕不能甚短。走這種通路，就像平常個人走路一樣，想走的快，就須要卸除身上的累贅。目前大學的累贅，並不算少。一個大學的行政措施常常是極少數人把持的局面。大多數人漠然不興聞，縱然問使與聞，亦祗是敷衍點綴而已。教授不能感覺到與學校成為一體，祗感覺到其自己地位之不重要。校長與教授往往相距千里。而且除極少數大學外，教授是一年一聘的。大規模的大學聘人之　，主要的操之於系主任之手。聘任委員會流爲形式，遇到聘請新人則向其提出，如有解聘，則並不提出。系主任如存公心，知禮士，自無話說；如其不然，即大有操縱排擠之餘地。爲校長者無不支持系主任，而學生則徒為壁上觀。這種進退之際，不必以成績及學間為標準的，公平一字，不易講起。學問乃終身事業，似此不能安走，人懊五日京兆之心，何能期其有成？而且學校的行政權也過分的集巾，因爲集中太過，擔負的工作太重，缺乏效率，不能周到，遂演成頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，不死不活，支離零亂的狀態。所以，爲什麼，大學校長的人選，敎授們不得參加竟見，祗以教育行政常局的命令行之？爲什麼教授的聘書祗一年一換，不改為比絞長久的時期？爲什麼不將學校的行政及管理作適當的分配及調整？這些問題，都是時下要改革大學教育所不能不考慮的。</p>
<p>一此外，還有一個重大的問題，那就是：中國文化究竟應該走上那一條道路？因爲所謂學術獨立云者，一方面是在治學上能站在自己的脚跟不倚賴外國的扶持，一方面是自己有一中心目標，對準這個目標，以學術的努力來建設一個新中國。中國究竟應該成爲一個什麼樣的國家？很多人似乎至今尙無具體而明確的觀念吧。我們若眞要變成民主國，我們就必須切實而澈底的下一番苦工，以滌除陳舊，啓發新機。我們就要在哲學，道德，文學，藝術，法理，及政治社會思想各方面上建立新的體系，新的評價標準，以奠定民主政治的根基。就是自然科學也應該配合着努力。很多人似乎還固執着中　之道，想折衷東西文化，使之合爲一體，發展成一種新文化。其實，中國舊文化與歐美的民主文化，乃截然兩個系統，若强而同之，必將南轅北轍，兩敗俱傷，徒將整個社會民生陷於混亂苦悶的境界中。而實行民主政治，也有其時間的因素，須一步一步的前進，一層一層的擴展。以我國舊社會傳統勢力之深厚，開始時，祗能施行有限制的民主。揆之英美民主政治的演進，又何嘗不是如此？若是一出脚就實行全民政治，就誇稱實行號無差別的「普選」制度，等於一跨步就要跳高跳遠，是猶孟子所說的「不教民而戰」，將孕伏下極大的困苦麻繁。若是覺得新的不易建立，舊的難得除去，工是感情上留戀已往，割捨不得，就不如乾脆的走回老路，恢復我們固有的威權政體的國家形態。</p>
<p>至於我們想在學術上站穩自己的脚跟，不倚賴外國的扶持，這在理想上是正確的。但理想未實現以前，脚跟還未站穩的時候，我們尚難遽爾拊棄外國的帮助。這就要討論到適之先生所建議的放棄留學的問題上了。我們以為就問題本身來說，留學與實現學術獨立的理想，並不違背。至於現在留學所生的毛病，則或由於本國大學之不充實健全，或由於留學尺度之過於寬鬆，或由於管理監督之不能嚴峻，均非根本問題。若是說現在留學經費太大，大學經費太少，應該挹彼注此，鞏固根本，那更是一種救濟於一時的現實想法了。就是我們學術獨立有一日眞正實現，留學政策還須作有限度的保留和持　。但是研究工作卻應該及早在國內各大學推行，使之配合着中國社會的情形，使其結果能對於中國社會帽子合頭，有實在的用處，就是國外歸來的飽學之士，也能資為憑藉以繼長增高，不患英雄無用武之地了。</p>
<h3>首批運華賠償物資</h3>
<p>（上接一版）中國代表幽之有資格官員稱；彼等竭力使第一批賠償物資能於本月底運華，據其估計，九千四百四十七部賠償裝備，在一九三九年北値五千七百八十三萬九千日元，彼時日元之外匯比率爲三與一美元，根據此項計算，提前移交之百分之卅賠償物資中，分配予中國之部份，將値一千九百廿七萬九千八百餘美元，惟物資之朽壞部份及多年運用之消耗，自應予除外。同時，提出移交之百分之卅之另一半（山英·菲·荷分有）共三千二百零七件機器及工具，共値五千九百五十四萬二千八百五十二日元。三國中荷蘭分得部份之價値居第二位，共獲得提前移交之百分之卅總量之六分之一，其中價値一千九百廿九萬六千八百四十四日兀之機器三千一百廿六件。非律賓分得部份，價値居三國中之末位，共一千九百一十萬三千四百七十一元，惟其分得機器之題目，則佔三國之首位，共計三千二百七十件。烟台海鳥瞰　（中央社攝）</p>

<h3>美向聯合國提出建議　聖地明年七月分治　過渡期間由聯大派員監督　當地法律與秩序暫由英軍負責維持</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播，英政府方面人士稱：英國將贊同美國所提巴勒斯坦分治之建議。惟問題乃在美國能否使猶阿兩族接受。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖卅一日電〕美國於今日建議巴勒斯坦之分治，於一九四八年七月一日起實行。美代表詹森於參加聯大巴勒斯坦委會分治小組會之秘密會議後，在記者招待會上，除宣佈已將前一建議向分治小組會提出外，並曰，美國建議之其他各點爲：　聯合國大會任命三人委會，以監督自目前至七月間之過渡時期；　過渡期間聖地之法律與秩序，由英軍負責維持；　應使猶太族及阿拉伯族有得在過渡時期組織『幕後政府』之機會，具有招募並配備其安全軍力之權;　美國自動放棄前此所提設立志願警察軍隊之建議；　建議的聯合國三人委會，隸屬聯合國大會管轄。觀察家指出美國今日之行動，與前此之態度有急進的轉變。美國前此主張微集國際志願軍，以防英軍撒退前後可能發生的無政府狀態，今美國建議允許英軍負責與過渡期內，維持巴勒斯坦之內部安全。</p>
<p>詹森在記者招待會中並稱，美國此一建議，意在使英國有撤退之時間，並可使聯合國巴勒斯坦調査委會報吿書中建議之兩年託管制度過渡辦法，無施行之必要。在過渡期間實施監督之三人委會，由一聯大所任命之高級專員鎭導，渠將以顧問資格，與英常局及猶阿領袖從事合作。三人委會旣係屬於聯大管轄，故其委員有建議機構應有之職權，惟當發生破壞和平或可能危害和平之局勢時，三人委會即改隸安理會管轄。美國復建議俟聯合國大會以三分之二之多數通過巴勒斯坦之分治後，猶太及阿拉伯族即開始組織「幕後政府」起草憲法，籌備建立猶阿經濟同盟之細則辦法，訓練行政人員並微募安全軍人員。</p>

<h3>四强縱橫捭闔的秘密介紹貝爾納表著「老實話」</h3>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員航訊〕十月十五日，美國前國務卿貝爾納斯（見圖）向四强的外交家投下一枚原子彈，他透露了四强外交政策的內幕新聞！從雅爾達至波茨坦會議以迄第一次倫敦會議，第一次莫斯科會議，第一次巴黎會議，以及去年十二月外長會議的一切外交秘密，都在他今天出版的「老實話」（SpeaKing　Frankly）一書中，全部予以洩露。　全書共三百十六頁，共分五節，每節分四段、目錄如次，　危機的警覺與責任；　雅爾達—三强團結的高潮；　局勢開始轉變；　波茨坦—功敗埀成；　在倫敦的挫折；　莫斯科會議成僵局；　倫敦會議一次，巴黎兩次；　巴黎和平會議及紐約和會；　中歐—嚴厲的試煉；　行動的途徑；　　向亞洲和平邁進；　　建立人民外交政策；　　原子能的管制；　　蘇聯追求的是什麼？　　我們今後往那裏去？</p>
<p>第三節末段「向亞洲和平邁進」述及中國部份。劈頭一句，貝氏用開門見山的筆法寫：「我們不要忘記第二次大戰是在太平洋爆發的。」他這一句話說明了亞洲在現階段危局的重要性。他接着又說：假使我們認爲歐洲可能成爲世界大戰的導火錢，那末，我們就必須把亞洲看做一團很大的火熖。</p>
<p>關於中國部份，貝爾納斯寫道：「巾國距離和平，依然遙遠；所可言者，即中國已處於巨大變化之邊緣上，我們應在可能範圍內，予此項變化以鼓勵及援助。中國需要我們的技術援助，但是中國應負執行　責任，以求達到成功。」</p>
<p>貝爾納斯又說：中國的重要性，不單是美國所瞭解，即蘇聯也很明白。在這方面，他透露蘇聯對中國的企圖。他證明在雅爾達會議中，史達林表明蘇聯參戰的代價，那就是共同管理東北兩大鐵路，把大連變爲自由港，並在旅順設立海軍根據地。此外在歷次會議中，莫洛托夫都提出同一問題：「美國在華倒底懷着什麼目的？」莫洛托夫並曾要求美蘇兩國同時從中國退出。貝爾納斯答辯美軍駐華是協助撤退日人，但是這一答覆未使莫洛托夫滿意。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯並敍述他與莫洛托夫討論無結果後，與史達林直接晤談的情形。關於這方面，貝爾納斯說：「我吿訴史達林說：蔣主席的政府是中國唯一可能的政府。中國共產黨並非眞正共產黨。史達林在答覆中承認國民政府是合法的政府。最令人感覺興趣的是史達林認爲毛澤東對共軍實力過份誇張。當貝爾納斯吿訴他說，毛澤東自誇在天津一帶有六十萬兵力的時候，史達林不禁大笑幾聲。</p>
<p>對於亞洲的結論，貝爾納斯是這樣的看法：「美國本身的安全以及世界和平，都擊於亞洲的進步。」</p>
<p>在序言中，發行人盛讚貝爾納斯的爲和平的努力。據他說：「自對德勝利以後的兩年中，貝爾納斯百折不回的爲和平而奮鬥。他一共走了七萬七千哩的路程，他從一九四五年一月以迄一九四六年十月一共參加過八次重大會議，即：工一九四五年一月廿二日至二月十二日雅爾達三强會議；　七月六日至八月七日波茨坦會議；　九月四日至十月八日倫敦外長會議；　十二月十二日至廿九日草斯科外長會識；　一九四六年一月七日至廿五日在倫敦舉行的聯合國全體大會；　同年四月廿三日至五月十八日巴黎外長會議；　同年六月十三日至七月十四日巴黎外長會議；　同年七月廿七日至十月十七日的二十一國和平會議。</p>

<h3>匈牙利謠傳　美對蘇宣戰　副總理扶病闢謠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：布達佩斯訊，今日匈牙利副總理（共產黨員）拉柯西抱病向全國發表廣播，聲稱外傳美國已向蘇聯宣戰之說純屬謠言，毫無根據，顯係國內反動份子與美國戰販所製造者云。</p>

<h3>參議大會圓滿閉幕　電力等追收價款　已繳者決請扣回　酌减節約筵席限價　放寬使用汽車限制</h3>

<h3>卅七年度歲入預算　通過總數增至萬億　歲出儘可能核减不得再增新稅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市三十七年度歲出入歲總預算，已經昨日下午市參議會第四次大會第十一次會議議決，歲入總數增加至一·〇九二·〇四六·九二四·五七四元，依全市人口計，平均每人負担約二十七八萬元。歲出儘可能核减，以符量入爲出之旨，而求收支平衡。大會對澦算案決議三項辦法如下：　照預決算委員會審查意見原則通過，送謂市政府根據指示各點重行編造。　市府各主管局應行裁减各項經費，由市政府統籌辦理。　市府組織編制規程，應由市府呈請中央早日予以核定，（因編制員工人數未有核定，開支即無根據）。</p>
<p>開源節流·兼籌並顧</p>
<p>市參議會爲審査市府交送之預算案，特於九月卅日延會一月。延會期間由預決算委員會先後三度邀集市府各局處首長及主辦會計人員暨參議會各小組委員會代表共同集合，就歲入歲出各項目遂一詳加審査。原預算歲入歲出原爲九八五·五一七·九二四·五七四元，但因本年十月份公敎人員待遇調整，增加百分之一百二十五，每月須增支三百億元，全年爲三千六百億，預算項下已短少一千四百億，且卅七年度全年尙須再有若干次之調整，歲入不敷歲出。在合法合理之原則下，乃稍事開源節流，以謀增裕庫收，緊縮支出。開源方面，對於本市公營事業，切實加以整頓，使公有營業企業化。節流方面仍應裁併駢枝機關，並節省不必要之開支。歲人部門經商定共增加一〇六·五二九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，其中以公共交通公司盈餘，地價稅·營業稅·屠宰稅所加最多。歲出部門，儘可能予以核减，裁併駢枝機關以節省開支。</p>
<p>剔除中飽·出售公地</p>
<p>至卅七年度建設性事業歲出及職員工役薪給，因物價增漲及待遇調整關係而須追加澦算時，對於因此產生歲入不數歲出之差額，參議會爲顧念市民業已負担一萬億以上之　數，認爲不得再行增加新設稅課。除整頓公營事業，增加盈餘外，更應採取下列兩項辦法：　財政局及其他各局應切實監督征收稅課及各項規費之征收人員，剔除中飽，杜絕逃漏。　必要時出舊使用價値較小之市有空地。</p>
<h3>大會之前　聯合舉行月會</h3>

<h3>聯電合約原則通過　部份條文尚待修正　且特種審查會研究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合電力公司營業權契約草案，經公用法規兩組聯席會議審査修正後，昨在大會展開熟烈討論。因此案爲中外合資經營之濫觴，各參議員非常重視，紛紛發表意見。馮有眞激昂陳詞，强調其十大反對理由：　草案第三條謂在本區域內，除參加公司外，政府不自行，亦不容許其他公私機關取任何人辦理，享有，或經營與本契約所定聯合電力公司之事業或同樣之事業。此實係一托辣斯之舉動。全國上下決無贊同托辣斯組織者。　草案第六條謂政府茲同意聯合電力公司僅須繳納本區域內隨時現行之土地及建築物捐稅。無論現在及今後，對於公司任何他種財產，均不征課或收取他種捐稅。實係過份之特權，決不應免稅。再第七條謂該公司有權憑自己之審酌，決定其認爲適宜之售電費率。根本荒謬，電費有關國計民生，應有限制。　草案第七條所載純利潤之百分率過高。　如發現外商對契約並不履行之時，又將如何辦法。　草案第九條稱政府經聯合電力公司之請求後，應爲該公司徵用其爲本契約目的所需之士地。如照此施行，豈非該公司可任意徵用需要士地。　草案第十條，謂本契約得不經政府准許，讓與聯合電力公司，實慶藐視我國政府。　對於草案第十條所載，倘聯合電力公司發行公司債，而就其財產，包括本契約在內，設定質押權，充作担保時，所有公司債持有人，不受國籍限制。此項意見實不敢贊同。　草案第十三條謂雙方有異議時，應請國際法院院長指定一人仲裁，後雖經審查改每授權英國（第三國）電機工程師學會會長，由彼指定一非中美國籍之仲裁人。但中國之公司，應守中國之法律，斷不能請求仲裁，應完全受中國法院之保護與拘束。　契約所訂三十年之期實在太長。　中國斷無供給該公司為該契約目的所需這外匯之理由。</p>
<h3>時機寳貴錯過可惜</h3>
<p>黃樹聲等參議員嗣皆熱烈相繼發言，費參議員且提議本案保留至下次大會。趙局長曾玨隨即登台報吿，謂契約成立，公司始可向美借款，現在美國對此貸款興趣正濃，昏這可惜。陶參議員百用繼稱：本市亟需增加電力，聯合電力公司之成立，且可使本市有優先獲得賠償電機之機會。故建議大會成立特種審査委員會審査本案，如不能成立協議時，主席可召集臨時大會討論之。</p>
<h3>最後通過四項辦法</h3>
<p>最後大會表決通過四項辦法：　聯合常力公司營業權契約草案，先照審査會議已經提出修改各點大體通過。　本契約中尙須斟酌之條文，另組特種審査委員會，於半個月內，會同市政府商訂修正文字，送還市政府，呈請國府核定。如特種審査委員會不能有決議時，得由議長召開臨時大會決定。　特種委員會審査時，其他參議員如有意見，亦可自動參加討論，其參加討論者一併有表決權。　大會指定特種委員會委員傳汝霖，陶百川，唐世昌等卅七人，由傅汝霖，陶百川，馮有眞召集之。江海軍工路上中國農業機械公司大火濃煙直冒時情形（王之一攝贈）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市外灘歐戰紀念碑和平神像，於渝陷期間爲日寇拆毀，勝利後市參議會曾決議在原址改建肇和兵艦起義紀念塔。英國聯合服務會會長德威第，則函請市府重建歐戰紀念碑。　經市府擬具兩全辦法送參議會，由議長提交昨晨大會中討論通過。該辦法規定原址依英國聯合服務會之提議，重建歐戰紀念碑，全部工程照六月份市價估計需款約十四億元，由市府倡導組織委員會，聯合在滬各國僑民通力合作捐集款項，並由市府負擔一部份藉示倡導。另在外灘北京東路口黃浦公園前面廣塲公建肇和兵艦起義紀念塔，以與中正路口之和平神像交相輝映。紀念塔之設計，決定底座爲圓形，台階上建三角凹形，塔柱目地面起至塔頂計十一公尺，塔柱三面刊紀念碑字樣，塔屋三面刊紀念文字，座上三面各設鐵錨花圈一座，表示肇和兵艦之象徵。估計需款約七億元，以由市庫負擔爲原則。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕馬君碩·周濂澤二參議員臨時動議，「關於辦理大選，應請政府特別審愼從事樹立民主風氣，澈底防止非法包辦及成脅利誘等情弊，以重人民基本權利，而奠憲政基礎案」，並有辦法三點　各種選舉，應以人才爲重，由各候選人依法競選，澈底防止非法包辦，　斷，威脅，利誘及其他妨害選舉或秩序之行爲。　所印各種選舉票總額，及分發；單位數目，應由選舉事務所據實登報通吿，以昭大信。　應保障選舉人自由投票選舉，在投票所，除派定職務之員警外，禁止軍警憲及其他人士逗留。經大會決議：一致通過。</p>
<h3>冤獄賠償將提討論　漢奸假釋鄭重辦理　司法部長謝冠生表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨以法律上諾問題，叩詢來滬之司法行政部部長謝冠生，承吿稱：　上海市參議會最近通過之寃獄賠償建議，本部亦極注意，已擬有具體辦法，將提出五日開幕之全國司法行政會議討論，此一問題有兩點必須解決：1制定賠償法律，2確定賠償預算，蓋一談及賠償，即涉及經濟問題也。　漢奸假釋問題，依照普通刑法第七十七條辦理，惟須更爲鄭重縝密。　漢奸家屬呼籲於憲政實施時之大赦問題，此舉係中央政府之命令，非本部權力所及。　上海地院地檢處，將覓一辦公大厦，刻已有眉目，不日即可實現，地院地檢處將合署辦公。</p>
<h3>各項議追認通過</h3>
<p>又參議會第三次大會休會期間，各種委員會決議重要議案，除預決算委員會各項決議性質特殊，另案提設大會通過追認外，其餘各委員會重要決議案計一二四件，昨午提請大會追認，決議通過。</p>
<h3>討論冬令救濟費　通過跑馬慈善賽　外加足球賽與發動勸募兩項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市冬令救濟委會爲籌募冬賑經費，擬定　發行難民救濟獎劵，　附加娛樂稅二成，　舉辦跑馬慈善寳等三項辦法，提交參議會討論，由潘議長交付昨晨第四次大會第十次會議公決。經一時半之熱烈討論，決議：　原辦法第一項删除，　原辦法第二項原則可行，應由各娛樂業按代收方式勸募，數額相當於原價之二成，並以冬令救濟期間四個月爲限。　原辦法第三項觀過，根據司法院之解釋，應由市府呈報中央核准後方可舉辦，名稱定爲「冬令救濟跑馬慈善賽」，指定充作冬令救濟經費之用。　加辦法第四項爲「舉辦冬令救濟足球慈善賽」。　加辦法第五項爲「發動向各界勸募」等語。</p>
<h3>難民廿萬生命堪虞</h3>
<p>該案討論前，冬令救濟委員會副主任委員社會局長吳開先首報吿提案理由稱：今年本市難民較去年多十倍，數達二十萬人。寒冬將臨，衣食不周，生命堪慮。冬令救濟會已定自十一月十六日起開始收容救濟，舉辦工賑，設庇寒所，施粥施衣。預定籌款六百億作爲經費。因工商界年來認募已達數千億，恐不勝負担，故擬採用賽馬等三辦法。但發行救濟獎劵一項，此次晋京時，張院長曾表示，前次爲救濟兩廣蘇北四川各地水災，有人提議發行全國性慈善獎劵，亦未獲政務會議通過，囑另想他法。故今日撤回發行獎劵一項辦法，其他各項，請參議員諸公討論。</p>
<p>吳局長報告畢，各參議員紛紛熱烈發言。張中原，王先靑等贊成慈善賽馬，費樹聲反對，認爲第一次大會決議反對賽馬，現欲開放，難自圓其說。</p>
<h3>違法問題宣讀條文</h3>
<p>馬君碩認為賽馬雖冠以慈善二了，仍為違法之舉，參議會如贊成賽馬，即帮助政府違法，人民可向法院控吿賭博罪。潘議長爲使討論有根據起見，宣讀司法院對跑馬是否違法之解釋，認爲發彩票不一定犯罪，根據刑法第二六九條，米經政府允准而發行之彩票方有賭博罪。此次賽馬搖彩係政府提出，經參議會通過後並將呈請中央核准，則與刑法並無抵觸。朱文德補充潘議長對刑法二六九條之解釋稱，意岡營利而發行彩票者方屬違法，救濟非爲營利，當非違法。朱扶九建議附加娛樂稅自二成增至五成，並舉辦慈善足球賽。其他欲發言之參議員尙多，因時間不及，即提付表決。潘議長於表決前再度宣讀司法院對賽馬是否爲賭博之解釋，以示鄭重，最後經舉手公決籌募冬賑經費辦法如前。</p>

<h3>蘇北行　東台聞捷</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十月卅一日訊〕今年入秋，天高氣爽，氣候正常，蘇北廣大的棉田，都吿　收，但是蘇北產棉最稱　　的東台，棉田迄今泰半尙在匪手，東台九區的大中集團鄉，是盛　細絨的棉區，五區仇湖及七區　潼各鄉，是廣大粗絨的產區，現在都成了東台匪軍的根據地，匪軍的紫石縣政府及東泰邊區的指揮所，都設在仇湖轄區以內，並且在被匪軍盤踞將近十年的周家垜（距縣城東南約四十華里）還設有小型兵工廠，被服廠，紡紗廠，多種軍需工業，以及儲藏在東台縣境東南西南各鄕搶掠所得的棉花，食糧和各種物資的倉庫，仇湖區的轄鄕距城最遠的亦不過七十華里，然而匪軍竟在那小小的周家垜，建立了這樣的一個老巢。據東台各方報吿，這一個匪巢所憑藉的武力，有兩個團及若千民兵，即所謂紫石獨立團，和紫石新兵團，前者在第一綏靖區司令部暨過去的泰東如三縣官文書上曾刻劃些什麼「兇悍」「精銳」的一類字樣。</p>
<p>歲星禍東老巢吿終　十月二十五日，爲東台縣城光復一週年之前二日，記者適由鎭江旅行揚泰公路而抵斯境。常記者到達縣城之次日，（二十六日）駐防東台之「六六一五」部隊副旅長張翹柳將軍正親率其精銳神勇之鐵光部隊兒，出剿盤鋸縣屬五區仇湖之悍匪，所謂紫石獨立團，經過卅六小時之追學戰一舉而攻克其老巢周家垜，當日逐村搜剿，復連續收復仇湖，施家溪，沈家垜后港，白甸，官莊等，重要據點十餘處，此役東台縣長李俠夫縣參議會秘書張碧水及流亡在外之五區區鄉保長均隨軍出征進入此新收復區，撫輯流亡，料理善後。二十九日捷報傳來人人額手，家家懸旗，逃過近一百次難的東台人民，每個人的沉重心頭，都好像輕鬆了一半，一位慣於談經說道的兒時同學，送我一張，鐵光社的捷報，並且在後面寫了那「歲星禍東，老巢吿終」八個大宇。其實像道樣的戰果，在那積十餘年剿匪經驗，持重實幹的部隊長薛仲述將軍看來，這祗算一個小捷，後面且舉事實來說明。</p>
<p>茅草棚前細數戰果　抗戰勝利，已經兩年，東台縣城的收復，恰滿一年，可是在這不長不短的悠條一年中，祗有縣城和少數鄕鎭的人民，在慢嚼勝利的苦果，尙不知苦盡甘來，須待何日，至於全縣三分之二以上的土地和人民，還不曉那勝利的果兒，是甜，是酸，毋怪當記者踏進這祖宗廬墓所在地的孤城次日，會見縣參會議長朱石均，縣黨部書記長詹保黃，縣商會理事長王竹坪，靑年團主任翟政，縣參議員倪壽慈，徐相舟，蔣駿　，諸位先生以後，談到匪患所加諸於人民的痛苦，大家都禁不住嗚咽欲泣，雖然大家都知道軍事很有辦法，縣長　算是一個好人，老百姓大多是忠厚老實人，然而設使基層政治還不能趕快搞好，自衛隊還不能作適應事實需要的組訓和指揮，大家還不提高安不忘危的警覺，這一百五十萬同鄉，恐怕和那拉來拉去的無情鋸齒，也許還有一個不長不短的不解　，恐怕那可口中吃的白湯銀絲麵，淸香脆長魚，螃蟹獅子頭，又將貴得使江南人聽了都不敢下箸了，這眞是一個大悲劇。</p>
<p>綏靖區的茅盾現象和怪狀，眞是數不淸，說不盡，記者於十月三十日中午，二次會見「六六一五」部隊長薛仲述，和某旅副旅長張翹柳兩將軍時，我們曾在通楡道旁的茅屋前，對於這次攻克周家垜匪巢的戰果，作了一個總检討，他們二位認爲東台縣境的匪軍實力，是脆弱的但澈底殲滅殘匪肅淸牠的惡化勢力，還需要一個相當時期，他們坦率說出，這次收復周家垜，僅僅俘匪廿餘，斃匪數十名，俘獲步槍十餘支，舊砲彈二百餘發，戰馬五匹，收音機一部，紡紗縫衣機十部，及數百石食糧和棉花，並救出若干難民，匪軍紫石獨立團，已聞風逃向陸家窰，（該地接近泰縣之海安，）匪軍新兵團，已經化整爲零，向蘆　深處逃去，國軍正會合地方團隊加緊追剿，不過爲了防止這一股殘匪死灰復燃，還須火家協同一致加上一把勁。</p>
<h3>津市同命鴛侶　絕命書已發現　自殺係因生計壓迫</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十月卅日航訊〕津北洋飯店內　慶能（以昶）董吉鳳雙雙自殺案，已誌昨報。兩人自殺的原因，現在已由他們寄給董吉鳳父母的信裏得到說明，這封信的原文如下：</p>
<p>「父母親老大人滕（膝）下，敬禀者：這樣的別去，想大人不會想到這嗎（麼）快，可是女爲自己不能生活，更不能爲大人出力，而且爲大人失面，還是走這條路好，以免爲大人掛懷。女二人爲無能，不能同生，同死可成就滿足，只望大人不要思念這不孝之女，死在九泉也是樂的。盼大人別傷心！女別了，久別了！我的爸爸，媽媽，小弟，妹妹，敬祝親愛的父母親永久健康。不孝女小鳳，壻以昶叩別。十月二十七日。付（附）有當票二張，爲怕丟失大衣，當了十六萬的是繼昌的，十五萬的是吉玳的」。</p>
<p>燒餅待客心香勞軍　踏進綏靖區，看到軍事方面的一切進步，眞加強了我們「戡亂必勝，建國必成」的若干信心，駐防東台的「六六一五」部隊軍風紀的優良，已是有口皆碑，但是薛仲述將軍，每次接見記者時，還是很謙虛地，探詢他的部下，在東」的官兵特長，是耐勞克苦，而無　氣，薛張二將軍治兵的要訣、是機動敏捷，而能與士兵共廿苦，所以能打，肯打，他們深切明瞭，在蘇北打匪，必須時時爭取主動，洞燭機先。常記者在安蒞會見張翹柳將軍時，他和某團官兵雖然在三天三夜之中，僅僅睡眠八小時，而在由沼澤地帶，　越公路時，還是不休不眠地，向目標挺進，看不見他們一絲疲勞，他們二位在草棚前板凳上，招待記者，大啖燒餅，吃過以後，還爲蘇北人民愛讀的申報，敬謹題字，他們那種天似無邪，勇於負責的精神，使我異常減動，記者叨擾燒餅二枚，以後，敬獻心香一辦，預祝他們馬到成功。（特派員房滄浪）</p>

<p>〔本報訊杭州十月卅一日訊〕浙江大學學生自治會主席于子三，學生鄂伯瑾，校友陳建新，黃世民等四人，於本月二十五日深夜，在湖濱大同旅館五十二號房間，被省會治安機關逮捕，其中于子三一名，已在獄中斃命，詳情如下：</p>
<p>逮捕經過　據治安機關發表稱：「本月二十三日，接獲京滬方面情報，有共匪重要份子陳建新，黃世民兩人，定二十五日來杭，策動杭市同黨份子，圖謀不軌，響應共匪軍事叛亂，當即指派幹員，分頭出動偵査，果於該日錢塘號聯運車抵站時，發覺有行動可疑者兩人，由在站迎接之靑年數人，陪往城站一麵館晚餐，旋同登三輸車赴淸泰第二旅館，約一小時許，再轉至澦定之大同旅館五十二號房間。經偵查人員偵察結果，認爲行踪可疑，當由治安機關於深夜二時許指派幹警前往檢査，證實自滬來杭之兩人，一爲陳建新，（現任上海道中女中敎員，）一爲世民，（上海中農行職員，）赴站迎接之靑年，一爲浙大學生自治會主席于子三，一爲農經系學生　伯瑾。當塲於陳建新身上，搜出與共黨份子來往重要信件九封，共黨刊物三件，現鈔四十九萬五千元。於黃世民身上，搜出活動經費收賬單一紙，載明數目約二千餘萬元，現款一百三十萬九千五百元，及共黨文件書籍多種。於于子三身畔，搜出秘密通知單一張，同黨名單二張，同黨密信一件。酈伯瑛身上，搜出同黨往來密函三件，同黨小組會議討論綱要一件，及其他重要證據多件，遂予逮捕。黃世民，酈伯瑾押於警察局，于子三，陳建新押於保安司令部，經談話結果，于等承認負責全國學聯會與浙大自治會之聯繁，及新潮社，全國學聯會兩反動組織內之主要份子，接受共黨，民盟之領導。至二十九日下午六時二十分，于子三突以碎玻璃片自殺斃命。陳。黃。鄂三人已於廿九夜移送沄院依法偵辦。</p>
<h3>廈門雲頂岩　藏有日軍械　鼓勵人民發掘</h3>
<p>〔本報厦門廿七日航訊〕日軍退出廈門時，曾將大量軍械暗藏雲項岩，軍事當局已鼓勵人民發掘。查雲頂岩離市廿五里許，拔海一千餘尺，爲厦門最高峯。又：四區行政督察專員陳拱北，頃自泉州抵厦，據談：閩南各縣治安不隹，散匪出沒無常，不勝其擾，泉州爲閩南僑鄕，歸僑多有私帶美式軍械，據估計：該項武器數量相當可觀，可編成一師團武力，因保管不力，致時落奸宄之手，釀成地方混亂局面。又訊：厦市禾山區十四個村莊，均被當局拆毀，闢爲機塲，影響所及，鄉民流離失所，無家可歸，生活無所依憑。市參會特爲此事，向市府呼籲，調査當時建築物被拆價値，索取賠償。市府據函後，已表示加以考慮。</p>
<p>死者檢驗　于子三死後，業由杭地院法醫室檢驗完竣，已製成報吿書，內稱：「本室受理檢驗浙江保安司令部神犯于子三自殺身死一案，于屍旁遣有用以自殺之玻璃片二片，形似囚房南壁之窗玻璃，爲求確實明瞭計，經檢取該窗上玻璃一片原樣比較，證實無誤。惟係從窗上取下，抑係原遺地下，無法斷定。再檢驗屍體咽喉創口甚深，口　皆血，足證爲生前喉管割斷所致，屍身全身無絲毫傷痕，更乏抵抗跡象，雙手皆有血跡，與傷口流出之血，均甚鮮紅，且右手虎口有被玻璃劃開之微痕一處，故斷定委係生前自殺身死。法院爲愼重計，將復調嘉興地院法醫蔣大頤來杭，重行覆驗。</p>

<h3>台北讀書記</h3>
<p>— 退廬</p>
<p>在偶然的一個機會裏，到台北適逢台省光復二週紀念舉行「台灣省美術展覽會」，分國畫，洋畫及雕塑三部門。看了之後，覺得台胞對於洋畫，很有硏究，水彩與油畫，都非常努力。但國畫一部，實在它的作風是東洋畫，列爲國畫、未免不倫不類。如王淸三的「中秋的大甲溪」，色調明朗，用筆舒暢。黃永祿的「絲蔭」，蔡伯學的「靑郊狗兒」，金德煌的「花烏集」，唐雲生的「靜池」，林玉山的「錦迎風」，吳敬輝的「琴譜」，林之助的「閑靜的郊外」，郭雪湖的「新月」等，都染　濃重的日本畫氣味。吳士銘的「雄風」，畫石亦米盡得其法，芥于開畫集中的石譜，似可參考。蔡錦添的「民族英雄」，許深川的「室內」，陳慧坤的「台灣士俗室」等，都是類乎廣吿畫的。吳利雄的「黃金花」，王淸三的「露」，楊江波的「麗春」，曾浴蘭的「佛桑花」等有些像圖案畫，這些決不能認爲是國畫。游本鄂的「母子猿」，樹幹都用細筆不分轉折頓挫，以國畫論，就是無「筆」，許深川的「秋興」，葉永的「濤聲」，李秋禾的「殘著」，溫長順的「鳳梨」，等色調柔和，魄力都不錯。吳金生的「園豐」，細錢條很生動，鄭靑圃的「山水」，尙嫰稚，不知善用焦墨。郭雪湖的「吟秋圖」，芭蕉葉亦不見「筆」，瓜葉用墨欠佳，尙少韻味。國畫的重點，就在有筆，有墨，乃有韻味。林玉山的「曉風殘露」，柳葉瑣碎而亂，吳鑑洲的「羣魚游泳」，墨色失之平，其病亦缺少韻味。江輕舟的「田園風趣」，雀甚隹。朱芾亭的「樹梢萬重泉」，襯法稍嫌紊亂。陳魁梧的「寒林歸鴉」，設色略俗。呂淸濤的「英雄獨立」，松針亦有軟弱無力之感。以上諸點雖國內名作亦所難免。</p>
<p>不過台省的畫，受日人的影響太深，亟應努力轉變否則浪費了許多天才和寳貴的光陰。有的人可直接專攻廣吿畫與圖案畫，因爲國畫的畫理太深奥，非多讀詩書，追源溯本不可。而且好的紙墨筆及顏料，在台灣買不到。國內毛筆售價尤昂，（一枝毛筆需國幣五十萬元至百餘萬元）最好由省政府當局邀聘國內名畫家到台演講揮毫，於合省盡人當可裨益不少。</p>
<p>編者按：本又所評不無失之嚴　。筆墨瑕疵，即在國內名作，間亦難免。台省光復未久，吾人固不能苛求；然亦實爲吾人所當注意，用特介刊此稿，猶望台省畫家酌爲　納而多與祖國美術界取得聯繫也。</p>
<h3>從上海藝術運動說到　黃君壁畫展的價值</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>復員後的上海藝術運動，由於敎育當局的重視，社會的提倡而逐漸開展了。尤其最近幾個星期內，自從「百年畫展」以後，便有方君豐，陳樹人朱應鵬，傳抱石等個展，以及中國畫會的會員畫展，都不是平凡庸俗，淺薄低級的作品。這些作品，整個表示了現代人的藝術成功，實在較之過去百年內的衰落陳襲的氣象，不可同日而語。</p>
<p>而且，社會各方面近來對於藝術的興趣，也一天比一天的加强提高了，上海不但爲全國文化的巾心，亦漸成爲美術的中心。正如顧一樵先生在中國畫會招待席上說的：各地美術家經過長時期的深切研究，努力創作之後，都要携帶了多量傑作，來上海舉行展覽。上海巳經成爲全國美術家「收名定價」，「藝術權衡」的中心地，相等於意大利的羅馬，法蘭西的巴黎。這是我們藝術工作者所感到安慰的，尤其在上海從事藝術工作的人，更覺到愉快而興奮。</p>
<p>中大敎授黃君璧先生，近在中國畫苑舉行個展陳列山水人物等一百餘件。我們從他墓擬元四家的四幀山水上看來，他對於子久，山樵，雲林，仲圭，都有深邃的心得，方有這樣形神畢肖的作品產生，這一點可以知道君壁的基本功力是可以敬佩的，並非一般立異趨新的作家可比。我們再從他「蔓門」，「三峽」，「黃山」等幾幾幀山水上，又可以看出君璧的創作天才，穩當老到，決不是拘泥古法一成不變的作品比可；更不是毫無根底，侈曾轉變，厚誣古人理法爲「傳統畫法」者所能夢見。這一種看法，與其說是筆者個人的見解，毋寗說是大家的共同感應，更不是我個人阿其所好。</p>
<p>我寫抱石畫展的文字中，曾經說上海畫壇，從他畫展之後，該有新的轉變，現在君壁正和抱石有異曲同工之妙。所以，我又感覺到國畫的途徑是廣大的，平坦的，光明的，牠可以讓所有的藝術工作者去開發，去建樹。主要的條件是作者需有深厚懇切的學藝修養，然後才能溫故知新地出奇制勝，而達到高明的理想境界。所以君壁畫展的價値也就在此。</p>
<h3>秋來</h3>
<p>— 鳧公</p>
<p>門外凄風九陌塵，秋來活計愧淸新。松煤舊袖從全汚，燈火凉宵覺漸親；醉後忘形哀政徹，夢巾破戒惜輪國。朝朝萬瓦霜華積，黃落山川瑣尾民。</p>
<h3>記丁隴所臨敦煌佛像</h3>
<p>— 兪劍華</p>
<p>敦煌石洞壁畫佛像，爲世界最古壁畫之傾果僅存者，震驚　壞，名聞寰宇。近年有不少畫人赴敦煌硏究模寫，余以　居東南，去敦煌萬里，無緣一至共地，贍拜此藝術瑰寳，嘗引以爲恨。前見吾友大千居士所寫敦煌佛像，莊嚴美妙，頗慰　渴，惟所見太少，　嘗一臠，未饜老　之瑞。</p>
<p>李子丁隴夫婦　筆漫遊西北者十年，深入番地，寫其風土人情，親至黃河決口寫黃泛之漂沒冲激，其畫均長至數十丈，其膽大力雄，已可驚人。又曾居敦煌九閱月，擷取敦煌壁畫之精華，成極樂世界圖，有四百平方尺之　。又臨佛像四大幅，不但尺寸大小，一依原式，而賦色用筆，亦絲毫不走。蓋其目的在於以敦煌壁畫之眞而目示人，毫不參加個人意見於其中，使觀者恍如親入敦煌洞中，與一千除年以前之　相對，　非一大快事哉！其夫人所臨隋唐以來各種圖案，亦精妙可觀。今李子將展其所作於中國　苑，世之欲一觀敦煌　畫之廬山眞面目者，不可不一飽眼福也。</p>
<p>以寫意，意在高山，則高山；意在流水，則流水；意在風雨晦　，飛潛生動；則亦風雨晦明，飛潛生動。所謂意到筆隨，可謂善畫者矣，然「意」之所指，其域至廣；意之所會，其覺至玄；要在合「理」。理合則「神」全；一切「勢」「氣」「　」皆於是生。「理」者天地自然之眞諦；「意」者人爲學養之美覺。自然界一切形態之構成及其存在，必有其所以然之理。吾人以學養所育得之美覺，深加觀察，細爲審別，以爲確有移寫復現之價値者，乃借力於筆，現之爲畫，解衣磅礴，元氣淋漓，不知自然之爲我，我之爲自然，自然與我，神明一致，於是腕底紙上之所現者，必神氣充沛，韻味生動矣。是非讀萬卷書，行萬里路，而面九年壁者，不足以語此。抱石傳先生此次書展，出品凡一百八十餘件。山水人物，爭奇競美，大至丈幅，小止方尺，其爲畫也，或縱放加虎躍能搏，或幽淡如秋　春波，或剛健如精金煉鐵，或深厚如積　堆玉，或秀逸如蛛絲風　。蓋其山水，自王洽而至雲林諸家法，無不化而用之；人物自顧愷之而至周昉諸家法，無不選而法之；其取景構圖，則純憑我意之所得，循自然之理，而與造化者遊。想其潑墨落筆，當如風雨驟至，波濤洶　，而有乘槎探月，披髮入山之趣也。故其所作，無不氣足神究，而有奇致。是非可以常法繩，凡格論也。古之大家，獨樹異　，爲一代宗匠者，卒皆具此魄力，有此神解，願吾抱石勉之。仳之墨守成法，硁硁以古人自期者，讀抱石畫及余　，必將閉目掩耳而走，以爲過於狂怪，以爲過於標榜。但其人倘虛心靜氣，對於繪畫之所以爲繪畫之意義，加以三思必將恍然首肯吾當，而更有所興起也。</p>
<h3>周方白教授伉儷畫展引</h3>
<p>— 潘伯鷹</p>
<p>藝事之成根於天姿者三之一，根於力學與處境者亦各三之一。自倭亂以還，上國衣冠極流離生死之苦；然亦文人學士有史未經之奇境也。其才則乘於天，其學則恃乎己，其境之有浩於才與學者，則在乎人之善處之焉矣。故此十年喪亂之中，迄乎倭奴歸命之日，孰也有成？其成何若？課其殿最，皆自知矣。全所獨不能已於低徊慨慕者，則居今淞滬聲利之塲，而猶數數逢庸蜀違難之友，良不勝其欣忭之情也。周君方白，曩不以鄙倍見棄，居重慶，一日以其所畫竹石屬爲題之。余旣心識其人，而當其風趣。君與夫人陸傳紋女士皆擅丹靑，旁及雕刻，挾其藝　遊飲譽者久矣。今方以其所作列於九華堂，以訊春申識者。君復辱過，歡然有故舊之色。余雖怠荒，烏能不喜哉！君於畫所學甚博，天才甚高，涉歷山川，磨　人物，其所就視前尤高矣！是以樂爲介之於滬瀆君君子。丁亥九秋暫止齋謹記</p>

<p>古樂者，蓋指　鼓梵音而言。所謂梵音，實非梵音，乃以絲竹演奏古曲，而雜以金革之聲，故或名爲粗細十番。粗者，指金革而言。細者，指絲竹而言。我國古代之於樂器，原分八稱。曰金，曰石，日絲，日竹，曰匏，曰土，曰革，曰木。其後逐漸偏重於絲竹，而樂之爲樂，遂亦日趨單調。惟鑼鼓梵音，於諸種樂器，能兼收並蓄，而發爲妙音。其於金，則以大小鑼五六種，鋅角雲鑼並與焉。其於絲，則三弦琵琶提琴二胡。於竹簫笛。於匏取笙。於革大鼓中鼓小鼓。於木則板及木魚。抑揚疾徐，綜錯嗚奏，而能諸樂並重，別具風格，實足以代表我國音樂之特性。乃逐漸湮沒，不爲人重。考其原因，蓋以其用器廣而奏　，非一一澤取名手，無以配合，又非熟練不爲功。故今日能知此鑼鼓梵音者，可謂絕無僅有。惟紅豆觀主導西　先生，曾於此中精研，藏有「喜預」「香袋」「　亭侯」「萬花燈」「十八拍」等名譜甚多。最近曾於其私邸，邀集念少剛，沈恒一，吳凌如，金大千，朱堯文，汪宗達諸君及鄙人等，授與十項古調。研習之於，愈覺其結精致　嚴，頗思有以發　之。因悉十餘年前時，會有美國小提琴專家愛希漢氏，來華考察。得北大音樂敎授趙子敬氏之介紹，曾至無錫得聽是項古樂，頗爲贊美。其間「壽亭侯」一曲，且會以速記法摘錄以區。其後於英文大陸報屢次發表文字，稱崇備至。並致書於無錫音樂家楊蔭瀏氏，囑其注意研究，楊氏遂著　鼓梵音三巨冊。現該地名手，年高者或有謝世，而能奏演者尙不乏人。今以溥西園先生之倡，益以陽春社王仲鈞，徐巾和，李景年，程君謀，沈九如，天韻社　雲樓，楊蔭　，以及張聲，沈恒一，楊會　諸先生之協力。得邀請是輩名手來滬。於十一月三四五日晚間，似座貴州路湖社樓廳，演奏三塲。並佐以溥西園，沈恒一，陳華美，孔中山，沈　　如，陳葆藩，蔣　敏，彭志敏，朱堯文諸位先生之崑曲。古樂雅歌，相得益彰，誠不可多得之機會也。</p>
<p>「是的，岳先生，」耀羣明白了我爲什麼要提到這幾字；「警號是打算利用重機　槍斷　的響聲，作爲暗號；數目是三二……三二……連放……這麼重複三次。他們一聽，就動手夜襲。我們預備等到夜襲一開始，這邊也同時發動，您知道，昌平有許多無辜的農民，和幾個小販，被鬼子的特工無端的圈禁了起來。我和虎弟這一次從關外帶來的同志們，也被他們逮去了好幾個。我們打算一面襲擊日本鬼子的特工大本營，一面派人進攻他們　裏的小集中營。等到兩邊都得了手，我們的人，會合起來，再給他一個大攪動，然後四散撤退；預備退回北平近郊的北苑一帶·重新集合。集合之後，儘可能的速度，　到萬全或是宣化去。至於怎麼走法，等到集合以後再決定。」</p>
<p>耀　把她的計劃脫明之後，我腦海裏起了許多紛擾；因爲事前對於她這個計劃，連影兒也沒有一點。並且，對於昂平這一團，日本人的特工有多大的範圍，日本芷式軍隊，停留在道一帶的，有多厚的實力，我一點都沒有調査。至於昌平這一帶的老百姓，據我所知道的，多半肯是「安土重遷」的思想，走開了的，並不怎麼多。萬一照耀羣的計劃實現之後，我們的一羣，固然可以撤腿跑了，焉知日本鬼子，不拿這些老百姓來出氣？想到這裏，我便瞧着　俗：</p>
<p>「我有幾個疑問……，」我剛一開口，就被耀羣的手勢止住了。</p>
<p>「我知道您要門些什麼。可是關於買沙夫的問題？」耀羣笑着說。</p>
<p>「是的，可不止這一個問題……」我剛要說下去，又被耀羣剪斷了。</p>
<p>「關於買沙夫，」耀羣冷冷地說着：</p>
<p>「我現在稍爲有一點把握，在這個地區範關以內，我還能指揮她。換句話說，以前在天津，是她拿捏住了我；現在，反咨爲主，他可被我拿捏住了；因爲道一帶，她似乎失去了爪牙，不大能够動彈。照我的理想，他的問題，可以放在最後。現在他得聽我的指揮，這個您請別担心事。」</p>
<p>「似使實行了您的計劃以後，關於本地老百姓所受的影響，您也顧慮到了嗎？」我把這一點，向耀羣提了出來。</p>
<p>「這一點我早想過了。」耀羣胸有成竹似的：「岳先生，您得明白這一點；老百姓的問題，照我的眼光看，無論我們今晚是否舉行夜襲，日本鬼子對付他們，除了儘量蹂躪以外；該搶的搶了，該殺的殺了，該燒的燒了。此外，不見得還有什麼其他的新花樣。夜襲不夜襲，對於老百姓，似乎應該沒有什麼特別的影響。況且就憑我們這幾個人，也盡不了多大保護他們的責任，也不能始終保護他們到底。</p>
<p>「您想咱們這邊的人力，準够來一次攪動嗎？」這是我的第二個問題。</p>

<h3>Indefinite Postponement of Peace Conference with Japan: China Hopes to Break the Deadlock Soon - Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, who recently returned from the United States, publicly answered various questions from reporters regarding diplomatic matters at 11:00 AM today. However, he remained tight-lipped about U.S. aid to China, refusing to disclose any information. Today's press conference was the first held by Wang since his return to the country. Prior to the conference, reporters from various newspapers submitted numerous written questions, with a particular focus on U.S. aid to China. Wang provided a comprehensive response, which was largely similar to his reports presented at the Political Affairs Conference and the State Council. Regarding U.S. aid to China, reporters sought to understand the aid methods and the conditions for U.S. "supervision." Wang only stated in response: "Regarding the issue of U.S. aid to China, I do not intend to make any statement. It seems that such questions should be directed to Washington." Subsequently, Wang also answered oral inquiries from the reporters.</p>
<p>Wang expressed his hope that the media would pay special attention to the cooperation between China and India in international conferences. After describing the situation at the United Nations General Assembly, he stated that this assembly was the first time India attended as a fully independent nation. Over the past month, the Indian delegation and the Chinese delegation have been very harmonious on several important issues. Currently, each member state of the United Nations has its own group, but China is isolated. If China and India can reach complete agreement and adopt a consensus on certain major issues in international conferences, then these two major nations, representing 800 million people, even if they are not militarily powerful countries, their joint opinion will definitely have a decisive force on world peace. Therefore, I hope that all parties will value Sino-Indian cooperation and use this cooperation to serve world peace.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the peace conference with Japan, Wang stated: "It is currently impossible to predict when the drafting meeting for the peace treaty with Japan can be convened." He explained that the crux of the matter lies in the divergence of opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States advocates for a conference of eleven nations, while the Soviet Union advocates for consultations among China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Our proposal is that the drafting should be done by a conference of eleven nations, but every decision must be unanimously agreed upon by China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Currently, we are awaiting responses from the United States and the Soviet Union to our proposal and are still urging them to accept our position. "If either party does not accept China's proposal, I really do not know what other way there is to break the current deadlock and establish a peace treaty." Someone asked what our attitude would be if the United States and the Soviet Union did not accept our proposal. Wang replied: "I do not wish to make any statement at this time, because I do not want to assume that our proposal will not be accepted." Wang continued: "Currently, the atmosphere among the United Nations is becoming increasingly tense. This situation is unlikely to improve until peace treaties are concluded with Germany and Japan. In terms of these two major peace treaties, the establishment of a peace treaty with Japan is easier than with Germany. If a peace treaty with Japan can be completed soon, establishing peace in the Far East, the overall world situation may begin to improve. Therefore, China does not want to see the issue of the peace conference with Japan remain unresolved for a long time."</p>

<h3>China Proposes to the United Nations General Assembly to Limit the Abuse of Veto Power - Supports Simultaneous Withdrawal of Troops by the United States and the Soviet Union on the Korean Issue</h3>
<p>Regarding the situation at the United Nations General Assembly, Wang raised several important issues, explaining China's position: 　The issue of the veto power of the five permanent members: China has been extremely cautious in the use of the veto power and has not used it once in the past two years. Some members of the General Assembly advocate amending the Charter to abolish the veto power, but this is practically difficult and inappropriate, so China does not support it. We have an independent proposal on this matter, advocating for limiting the abuse of the veto power within the scope of the Charter. Several countries have expressed support for this proposal and it may be submitted for discussion at next week's meeting. 　The issue of the Permanent Committee: The Soviet Union strongly opposes this matter. We advocate that the committee can be established, but it cannot replace the General Assembly, nor can it infringe upon the powers of the Security Council. This view seems to be supported by the vast majority, but the Soviet Union may still oppose it. 　The Korean issue: The meeting of the four countries, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, was originally scheduled to be held on September 8 to discuss this issue, but it was suspended due to Soviet opposition. Therefore, the United States raised the issue in the General Assembly. We believe that if the United States and the Soviet Union, or the four countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union who participated in the Moscow Agreement, cannot reach an agreement, then this issue can naturally be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. China supports the simultaneous withdrawal of troops by the United States and the Soviet Union. However, if a government responsible for maintaining national order and representing the Korean people cannot be established before the withdrawal, then the day of the withdrawal will immediately plunge Korea into a state of anarchy or civil strife. Therefore, the timing of the withdrawal and the work before the withdrawal should be decided by the United Nations after consulting the opinions of the four countries.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Has Not Relaxed Control Over Japan</h3>
<p>Regarding the situation in Japan, Wang stated: "I was only in Japan for four days and met with various parties and had long talks. In my personal opinion, the Katayama Cabinet is indeed sincere in leading the Japanese people onto the path of peace and democracy. However, the Japanese people do not seem to have a high degree of enthusiasm to cope with democratic politics. If Japanese leaders can cultivate this enthusiasm, Japan's future will be guaranteed. General MacArthur has not relaxed control over Japan, and his fundamental policies have not changed. However, he is very worried about the current and future starvation of the Japanese people. Therefore, he has taken some steps to prevent the economic threats faced by the Japanese people now and in the future."</p>
<p>Wang's report lasted for 35 minutes. Later, someone asked about the issue of Lushun and Dalian. Wang stated: "This matter should be negotiated by the envoys of China and the United States in Moscow and Nanjing." He said that he was not prepared to talk about this issue today, so he would not answer.</p>
<h3>China's Wedding Gift to Elizabeth Entrusted to the British Delegation to China for Delivery</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Chinese government's wedding gift (three large boxes of famous Jiangxi porcelain) to Princess Elizabeth, the heir to the British throne, was delivered by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British Embassy on the 1st and entrusted to the British delegation to China for transportation to London and delivery to the British Royal Family. The porcelain gift consists of 175 pieces, including 24 sets of teacups and saucers, a large coffee and milk pot, a sugar bowl, 34 nine-inch soup bowls, and 24 each of nine-inch, eight-inch, six-inch, and four-inch vegetable dishes. The oval vegetable dishes are made of Ganzhou porcelain, produced under supervision in Jingdezhen, exquisitely painted and carefully fired, taking one and a half months to complete. The total value reaches 30 million legal tender.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Reparations Materials: China is Supervising Packaging</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch on the 1st] The Chinese Reparations Delegation stationed in Japan has begun supervising the packaging of 9,447 machines and tools. This batch of materials is the first to be transferred to China among the reparations materials. Although the exact date for the shipment of reparations equipment has not yet been determined, Chinese representatives in Tokyo and Sendai, Honshu, are preparing to handle the preliminary matters of shipping reparations materials. (Continued on column one, page two)</p>
<h3>Soldiers Defending Beitashan Awarded Medals by the Northwest Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Xining Dispatch on the 31st] In addition to defeating the enemy, the officers and soldiers of the Qinghai Cavalry 7th Brigade who defended Beitashan obtained various important enemy documents. After Commander Ma Jixiang forwarded them, the Northwest Headquarters specially awarded various medals of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to commend and encourage them. The ceremony was held on the Wulas grassland.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Discusses Two Principles on Japan's Reparations to Allied Nations: Military Industrial Equipment Must Be Dismantled and Removed, Economy Must Be Established on a Self-Sufficient Basis</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, in answering questions about the issue of Japanese reparations at a press conference with foreign reporters on the 1st, stated: "During the war, Japan's acts of aggression caused China to suffer heavy losses. The Chinese government should naturally make appropriate reparations claims based on the facts." Wang did not directly answer the reporter's question, clarifying the minimum percentage China is seeking. He stated: "Regarding the amount and methods of reparations, China has no fundamental differences with the United States and other Allied nations. All agree that Japan's military industry and equipment that could be converted into military industry must be dismantled and removed. At the same time, the Japanese economy can be established on a self-sufficient basis." The current issue needing research is how to make these two principles compatible. As for how to coordinate the reparations claims made by China and other related Allied nations and allocate them reasonably, that is a secondary matter. Wang stated: "China demands the restoration of sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands," but refused to answer whether to retain the military facilities of the U.S. military on the islands.</p>
<h3>China Should Account for the Largest Share of Japanese Reparations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Regarding China's position on the issue of reparations from Japan, according to well-informed sources, the amount is "at least" 40%. Considering the example of France obtaining 52% of the total reparations from Germany after the last world war, some officials and members of the public believe that 40% is unfair. The war destroyed almost half of our country. Therefore, the relevant authorities in our country have not yet made a decisive announcement on this amount. China believes that both production equipment and products should be considered as part of the overall reparations and firmly insists that the fulfillment of reparations obligations must be guaranteed and enforced by the Allied supervisory body in Japan. As for the external claims and property of the Japanese government or people, if their nature is due to directly or indirectly pursuing their aggressive purposes, they should be unconditionally confiscated and have nothing to do with reparations. This is also the unanimous conclusion of experts from all sectors of society in our country.</p>
<h3>Principles for the Committee on Supply of Materials to Sell Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Executive Yuan's Committee on Supply of Materials has decided on the following principles for the sale of materials in the future: 　Materials needed by government agencies will be supplied at low prices. 　The special contract distribution system will continue to be used for general consumer goods for the people's livelihood, and the selling prices will be discussed and agreed upon with reference to market prices at any time. 　In order to enable the industrial sector to benefit and prevent such materials from flowing into the hands of middlemen, the past auction methods need to be improved a lot. Relevant units are under orders to study detailed methods, which will be announced and implemented in the near future.</p>
<h3>Director-General of Posts Huo Xixiang Relieved of Post to Serve as China's Director at International Postal Congress</h3>

<h3>The British Delegation to China Returns to Nanjing, Praising Taiwan's Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The British Delegation to China, a group of six, returned safely to the capital at 3:20 PM on the 1st aboard the Ziqiang special plane after touring Pingjin, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Taiwan, Hankou, and Chongqing.

<h3>First Monthly Meeting of the National Government: President Zhang Reports on the Principles of Governing Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The National Government held its first monthly meeting on the 1st. President Zhang attended the meeting and reported on his impressions of his inspection of Taiwan. He first described the geography and ethnicity of Taiwan, believing that they are all part of China. He also praised the national spirit of the Taiwan compatriots, believing that it is the result of the historical and cultural influence of China. In the future, if China wants to remain a great power and stand permanently in the world, it will also use the power of this historical culture as its foundation. As for Japan's construction in Taiwan, whether it is political, educational, or economic, it is only half-finished. The upper-level politics are all in the hands of the Japanese. In terms of education, Taiwanese people are not allowed to have profound literary, philosophical, or political thoughts, nor are they allowed to have profound scientific and technological skills, only allowed to study medicine more. In terms of economy, the Japanese are only responsible for guidance. In fact, its foundation is created by our Taiwanese compatriots. Zhang then spoke about the government's future policy on governing Taiwan. In terms of politics, utilize the existing foundation and pay attention to the relationship, and do not easily change it. In terms of education, give Taiwanese youth more opportunities to receive university education. In terms of economy, Taiwan's resources are not sufficient to establish a regional self-sufficient economy. Taiwan's economic plan must be coordinated with the national economic plan.</p>

<h3>China Protects Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, Proposes to Organize a Mixed Security Team of Indonesian Chinese and Dutch Chinese, Hoping for Understanding and Agreement from the Indonesian and Dutch Governments</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Vice Minister Hua Gongchao recently made a statement on the issue of protecting overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, saying: There are about two million overseas Chinese living in the Dutch East Indies, most of whom are on the islands of Java and Sumatra. Since the conflict between the Dutch and Indonesian sides, the overseas Chinese in these two islands have been repeatedly burned, looted, and harmed by ordinary thugs. The Chinese government is very concerned and has repeatedly lodged serious protests and negotiations through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Indonesian-Dutch dispute is now awaiting mediation by a three-member committee organized by the United Nations Security Council. However, reports of damage to the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have not stopped. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Indonesian and Dutch sides will negotiate and agree to organize a mixed security team of Indonesian Chinese and Dutch Chinese in the Dutch-controlled areas, and organize a mixed security team of Indonesian Chinese and Dutch Chinese in the Indonesian-controlled areas, responsible for protecting the overseas Chinese and not taking hostile actions against either the Indonesian or Dutch side. As soon as the local area is stable, it will be revoked. We believe that this method is the best measure to protect overseas Chinese before the Indonesian and Dutch sides reach an agreement and we deeply hope that the Indonesian government and the Dutch government will understand and agree.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Overseas Chinese Leaving the Country: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Re-Presents</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there have been many applications from overseas Chinese for repatriation and from people for leaving the country.

The main points are extracted as follows: (Continued on the left corner of page two)</p>
<h3>Sunday Forum: My Views on the Question of Academic Independence</h3>
<p>— Fan Defen</p>
<p>In this time of war and social upheaval, the issue of academic independence has resurfaced on the crest of the era's waves. Its nature is complex, and its emergence is no accident. Since Mr. Hu Shih took the lead in advocating for it, the academic community has responded enthusiastically, expressing their opinions on the matter. This has not only broken the silence within academic circles, which rarely engage in discussions of concrete issues, but also represents a serious call for survival from the academic community in the face of danger. Although individuals may have differing opinions on the content of Mr. Hu's proposal, it is evident that this issue is indeed of great importance to national construction. It should be carefully considered with a wide range of perspectives gathered.</p>
<p>The author believes that all issues are inseparable from the context of the times and the environment. The discussion of this issue must first seek a clear understanding of the current era and environment in our country. China's eight years of resistance against Japan have left it devastated and exhausted, resulting in a major academic misfortune. This misfortune could have been hoped to be reversed with the victory of the war, first by patching up the leaks and then by turning weakness into strength. However, with the Communist Party's rebellion, the end of the war was followed by even more difficult years, which instead intensified the academic misfortune. The universities, claiming to be the highest institutions of learning, remained in the shape of refugee shelters; academic workers remained impoverished, busy with trivial matters all day long, lacking both sufficient time and a leisurely environment to study and pursue advanced knowledge, and also losing social dignity, almost reaching the end of their ropes. Academic undertakings, like other undertakings, are primarily entrusted to middle-aged individuals. These middle-aged people were devastated during the war, their academic achievements could not be advanced, and after the victory, they were unable to catch up quickly. Who will bear the responsibility for academic work? Therefore, "poverty" is indeed a severe factor in destroying academic pursuits.</p>
<p>Education during the Anti-Japanese War also had a peculiar phenomenon, that is, poverty on the one hand and expansion on the other. The number of universities and middle schools increased, and the number of students in each school also increased. This was indeed due to adapting to the environment of the Anti-Japanese War at that time, given the large number of students who fled from various provinces to the rear and the large number of schools that were displaced. It was necessary to adapt to the times and provide a place for a large number of young students to belong. However, it was inevitably greedy for more and emphasized quantity over quality, and thus flowed into crude and shoddy products, lowering standards, which is precisely the opposite of promoting culture and improving academics. The way to govern an army is to value quality over quantity; how about something as difficult and profound as academics? In the past, the number of scholars in our country was very small, but the emperors respected the worthy and society valued scholarship, so there were always people with profound academic knowledge. With our country's current poverty and weakness, if we only know to embellish progress by increasing the number of universities and middle schools, we will inevitably reduce the function of academics to improve upwards. Of course, when comparing the existing number with the rich and powerful countries in Europe and the United States, it is still far behind. But since everything is inferior to others, we should make fundamental plans, why compete for face in this superficial way for a while? If we want to eliminate illiteracy, then what should be developed and increased is only primary school education, and not necessarily universities. Moreover, social careers are not developed, the traditions of the old society's gentry are still strong, and a large number of university graduates are actually suffering from having no place to accommodate them. If things go wrong, it will only create batches of high-level idlers, who only want to get involved in the political arena, aggravating the situation of social unrest.</p>
<p>If the current situation continues to develop without correction, then the university will exist in name only and will no longer become a university. Mr. Hu Shih's proposal, though carrying the banner of academic independence, seems to be of a positive nature, but in reality, it is a passive way to save the day. His positive article is to specially develop several universities on a regular basis, but if viewed from the opposite side, it is equivalent to wanting to eliminate a number of universities. Because without development, it will only get worse and worse and be unable to survive; without elimination, there is no way to concentrate energy and enable the fittest to survive. It is necessary to rescue the excellent fit, and then stabilize them, and only with stability can there be development, and only with development can we embark on the road to academic independence. As for which universities are "fit" and which universities or departments should be first enriched and developed in China today, that is another question.</p>
<p>Time is still an important factor. It may take a long time to go from reorganizing universities to achieving academic independence. Taking this path is like walking on the road: if you want to walk fast, you have to get rid of the burden on your body. The current burdens on universities are not few. The administrative measures of a university are often controlled by a very small number of people. The vast majority of people are indifferent, and even if they are asked to participate, it is only a perfunctory decoration. Professors cannot feel that they are one with the school, they only feel that their position is unimportant. The president and professors are often thousands of miles apart. And except for a very few universities, professors are hired for one year at a time. The hiring of large-scale universities is mainly controlled by the department heads. The appointment committee becomes a formality, and it is only presented to them when new people are hired, and if there is a dismissal, it is not presented. If the department head is impartial and knows how to treat scholars with courtesy, there is nothing to say; if not, there is plenty of room for manipulation and exclusion. The president cannot help but support the department head, while the students are only bystanders. At this time of advancement and retreat, it is not necessary to take grades and scholarship as the standard, and the word fairness is not easy to talk about. Learning is a lifelong career, and if you cannot settle down like this, and have the heart of a temporary official, how can you expect success? Moreover, the administrative power of the school is also excessively centralized. Because the centralization is too excessive, the work undertaken is too heavy, lacks efficiency, and cannot be thorough, it has evolved into a state of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, neither dead nor alive, fragmented and disorganized. So, why can't the professors participate in the selection of university presidents, but only execute the orders of the education administration? Why are professors' appointment letters only exchanged once a year, instead of changing to a relatively longer period? Why not make appropriate allocation and adjustment of the school's administration and management? These questions must be considered in order to reform university education today.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another major issue, which is: which path should Chinese culture take? Because the so-called academic independence means that on the one hand, it can stand on its own feet in academic research and not rely on foreign support, and on the other hand, it has a central goal of its own, aiming at this goal and using academic efforts to build a new China. What kind of country should China become? Many people seem to have no concrete and clear concept even now. If we really want to become a democratic country, we must earnestly and thoroughly put in a lot of hard work to cleanse the old and inspire new opportunities. We must establish new systems and new evaluation standards in philosophy, morality, literature, art, jurisprudence, and political and social thought in order to lay the foundation for democratic politics. Even the natural sciences should cooperate in this effort. Many people seem to still cling to the doctrine of the mean, wanting to compromise Eastern and Western cultures and combine them into one, developing a new culture. In fact, the old Chinese culture and the democratic culture of Europe and the United States are two completely different systems. If they are forcibly merged, they will inevitably go in opposite directions, both sides will be hurt, and the entire society and people's livelihood will be plunged into a state of chaos and depression. The implementation of democratic politics also has its time factors, and must advance step by step and expand layer by layer. With the deep-rooted traditional forces of our old society, only limited democracy can be implemented at the beginning. Looking at the evolution of democratic politics in Britain and the United States, isn't it the same? If we implement universal politics as soon as we step out, and boast of implementing a "universal suffrage" system without discrimination, it is like taking a leap to jump high and jump far, which is like Mencius's saying of "fighting the people without teaching them," which will breed great hardships and troubles. If you feel that it is not easy to establish new things and it is difficult to remove old things, and you are emotionally attached to the past and cannot bear to part with it, then it is better to simply go back to the old road and restore our inherent authoritarian political state.</p>
<p>As for our desire to stand firm on our own feet in academics and not rely on foreign support, this is correct in theory. But before the ideal is realized and before we have stood firm, we can hardly abandon foreign help. This leads to a discussion of Mr. Hu Shih's proposal to abandon studying abroad. We believe that in terms of the issue itself, studying abroad is not contrary to the ideal of realizing academic independence. As for the problems that arise from studying abroad now, they may be due to the inadequacy and unsoundness of domestic universities, or due to the excessive looseness of the standards for studying abroad, or due to the inability to strictly manage and supervise, all of which are not fundamental problems. If it is said that the cost of studying abroad is too high now and the funding for universities is too low, and that we should transfer funds from one to the other to consolidate the fundamentals, then this is a realistic idea to solve the problem for the time being. Even if our academic independence is truly realized one day, the policy of studying abroad must be retained and maintained to a limited extent. However, research work should be promoted in domestic universities as early as possible, so that it can be coordinated with the situation of Chinese society, so that its results can be useful to Chinese society and have practical uses. Even the well-learned scholars who return from abroad can use it as a basis to continue to grow and increase, and not worry about having no place to use their talents.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Reparations Materials Shipped to China</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Chinese representatives and qualified officials said; They are working hard to ship the first batch of reparations materials to China by the end of this month. According to their estimates, 9,447 pieces of reparations equipment were valued at 57,839,000 yen in 1939, when the foreign exchange rate of the yen was three to one US dollar. According to this calculation, the portion of the 30% of reparations materials transferred in advance that is allocated to China will be worth more than 19,279,800 US dollars, but the deteriorated parts of the materials and the consumption of many years of use should be excluded. At the same time, the other half of the 30% proposed for transfer (shared by the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and the Netherlands) consists of 3,207 machines and tools, worth a total of 59,542,852 yen. Among the three countries, the value of the portion obtained by the Netherlands ranks second, accounting for one-sixth of the total amount of 30% transferred in advance, including 3,126 machines worth 19,296,844 yen. The value of the portion obtained by the Philippines ranks last among the three countries, with a total of 19,103,471 yen, but the number of machines it obtained ranks first among the three countries, with a total of 3,270 pieces.

<h3>Content of Mr. Chen Guofu's Address</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) This bank has developed very slowly in recent years, but there is a lack of talent and experience. If it expands too quickly, the foundation will be difficult to consolidate. In the future, we should take a steady approach. The work steps are divided into four stages: research, inspection, discussion, and experimentation. After this bank affairs meeting, each unit should correct shortcomings and promote advantages. This bank was established to support cooperative undertakings. All colleagues should adhere to the basic mission and have a long-term vision, and not be envious of ordinary banks for making money. Strengthen the guidance work. If there is no cooperative organization, guidance should be provided to establish one. After it is established, its progress should be promoted. If specialized cooperation can be developed, the deposit problem can be solved. For example, the total value of tobacco leaf production in Xuchang this year reached 220 million. If production, processing, and sales can all be done through cooperatives, not only can the deposit problem be solved, but also the people's livelihood can be improved. In the future, trust business should be mainly cooperative and should not be operated as ordinary trust business. The audit work must be strengthened. Enhance credit investigation work to avoid manipulation by local tyrants and evil gentry. Loans must be issued publicly. The employment of personnel and the expenditure of expenses should all be based on the principle of verifying and economizing to avoid waste.</p>
<h3>Northeast Electric Power Bureau: First Anniversary of Establishment. Still Many Worries and Difficulties Experienced</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by This Newspaper on the 1st] The Northeast Electric Power Bureau is celebrating its first anniversary today. The same day is also the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Resources Committee. The development of Northeast Electric Power in the past year has been through many worries. Before May, based on the principle of water as the main and fire as the auxiliary, the power generation gradually increased and was able to maintain a considerable level. After May, due to the destruction of the Songfu ultra-high-voltage power line, the northern hydropower could not come south, so it was changed to fire as the main and water as the auxiliary. All thermal power generation equipment in the Northeast was mobilized to increase production. The western and southern borders of Liaoning relied solely on about 70,000 kilowatts of thermal power to maintain it. Currently, the power supply in Northeast China is about 120,000 kilowatts, 45,000 kilowatts of hydropower, and 75,000 kilowatts of thermal power, which is only half of the required amount, which has a significant impact on industrial and mining production. Currently, thermal power generation has reached its highest load. Only by making the Fengman power come south can the difficulty be resolved.</p>

<p>Restrictions on Overseas Chinese Emigration</p>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Overseas Chinese returning from British Malaya in Southeast Asia must possess local documents from 1937 onwards, such as a consulate passport, registration certificate, residency permit, birth certificate, return permit, or immigration bureau-approved entry permit, to be issued a certificate. For new arrivals, attention should be paid to the immigration bureau's population certificate and the consulate's certificate.</p>
<p>Returning Overseas Chinese from Burma, who intend to return to their original place of residence, are limited to those who have been approved by Mr. Yu Kan Mao, the representative of the Burmese government, and have been given a voucher. New arrivals must have a recent population certificate approved by the local government, otherwise, certification will be suspended.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese at the Vietnamese border of French Indochina must still hold local documents from 1937 onwards, but tax payment receipts are also considered as one of the document. For new arrivals, without the local entry permit and the certification from Peking and Shanghai, certification must be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>For Overseas Chinese at the Philippine border, visa applications to the Philippine consulate in Xiamen are temporarily limited to those who returned to China after 1941, hold appropriate local documents, and were born in the Philippines. Those who were sent back to China after the liberation of the Philippines will not be allowed to enter. Those who returned to China before 1941 will be dealt with later. As for new arrivals, without the local immigration bureau's entry permit, no certification will be provided.</p>
<p>Returning Overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies, with the approval of the local government, are limited to those that the area can accommodate, allowing 1,450 people from Fujian and Guangdong in China to return, but they must have valid local documents, such as a residence certificate, birth certificate, passport, or registration certificate, and have returned to China after the War of Resistance and have been registered and approved for repatriation by the United Relief Administration. Overseas Chinese merchants with higher status who return to the Dutch East Indies at their own expense can also apply, but whether they can leave the country depends on whether the Dutch consulate is willing to issue a visa. As for new arrivals, due to the ongoing war in the area, departure is temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Due to food and housing problems in European countries, both new and old arrivals are not welcome, so except for those approved for entry by the local government and holding recently issued credentials, they should not be certified.</p>
<p>During the current Allied control era in Japan, both new and old arrivals are temporarily suspended from entering.</p>
<p>In the United States, apart from quota immigrants with other regulations, which should be submitted to the association for review, only officials, merchants (import and export traders), teachers, pastors, and students can apply to go to the United States, but they must have valid identification documents. Ordinary tourists are temporarily suspended from entering at this time. In addition, old arrivals returning to the United States must have a valid passport or entry permit, birth certificate, or a letter from our consulate general approved by the local immigration bureau.</p>
<p>The Canadian government, recognizing its sparse population, finds it necessary to increase it significantly, and is now amending the immigration law to relax restrictions on the entry of Europeans. Wives and children under the age of eighteen of Chinese nationals who have joined Canadian citizenship can be allowed to enter, but they must have valid documents.</p>
<p>The various countries of Central and South America have very strict restrictions on the entry of Overseas Chinese. Certification should not be given casually unless they hold valid local documents.</p>
<p>From this year onward, Siam originally allowed 10,000 Chinese immigrants to enter, but due to different views on the criteria for new and old arrivals, the local immigration bureau claims that "the quota of 10,000 people this year has been exceeded," resulting in the detention of more than 500 people. Negotiations are currently underway. Before this case is resolved, all new arrivals should be temporarily suspended from leaving the country. Old arrivals must hold local documents that are less than one year old. Only those that are currently valid can be certified. Further notice will be given when the issue of new and old arrivals is resolved.</p>

<h3>U.S. Proposes to the United Nations: Partition of the Holy Land by Next July; UN to Appoint Personnel to Supervise During Transition; British Forces Temporarily Responsible for Maintaining Local Law and Order</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 1st Broadcast: Sources from the British government say that Britain will support the U.S. proposal for the partition of Palestine. The problem lies in whether the U.S. can get both the Jewish and Arab communities to accept it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 31st Dispatch] The U.S. proposed today the partition of Palestine, to be implemented starting July 1, 1948. After attending a closed meeting of the UN General Assembly's Palestine Committee's partition subcommittee, U.S. Representative Johnson announced at a press conference that he had submitted the previous proposal to the partition subcommittee. He also said that other points of the U.S. proposal are: The UN General Assembly appoints a three-member committee to supervise the transition period from now until July; During the transition period, British forces are responsible for maintaining law and order in the Holy Land; The Jewish and Arab communities should have the opportunity to organize "shadow governments" during the transition period, with the power to recruit and equip their security forces; The U.S. automatically abandons the previously proposed establishment of a voluntary police force; The proposed UN three-member committee is under the jurisdiction of the UN General Assembly. Observers point out that the U.S.'s actions today represent a radical change from its previous attitude. The U.S. previously advocated raising an international volunteer army to prevent the anarchy that might occur before and after the withdrawal of British forces. Now, the U.S. proposes allowing British forces to be responsible for maintaining internal security in Palestine during the transition period.</p>
<p>Johnson also stated at the press conference that this U.S. proposal is intended to give Britain time to withdraw, and to make it unnecessary to implement the two-year trusteeship system transition method recommended in the UN Palestine Investigation Committee report. The three-member committee supervising the transition period will be led by a high commissioner appointed by the UN General Assembly, who will cooperate with the British authorities and Jewish and Arab leaders in an advisory capacity. Since the three-member committee is under the jurisdiction of the UN General Assembly, its members have the powers that the agency should have. However, when situations that disrupt peace or may endanger peace occur, the three-member committee will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Security Council. The U.S. also proposed that after the UN General Assembly passes the partition of Palestine by a two-thirds majority, the Jewish and Arab communities will begin to organize "shadow governments," draft constitutions, prepare detailed rules and methods for establishing a Jewish-Arab economic alliance, train administrative personnel, and recruit security forces.</p>

<h3>A Secret Introduction to the Intrigues of the Four Powers: "Speaking Frankly" by Byrnes</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Correspondent in New York] October 15th, former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes (see picture) dropped an atomic bomb on the diplomats of the Four Powers, revealing insider news about the Four Powers' foreign policies! All the diplomatic secrets from the Yalta to Potsdam Conferences, as well as the First London Conference, the First Moscow Conference, the First Paris Conference, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference last December, are all revealed in his "Speaking Frankly," which was published today. The book has a total of 316 pages, divided into five sections, with four paragraphs in each section. The table of contents is as follows: The Awareness and Responsibility of the Crisis; Yalta—The Climax of Unity of the Three Powers; The Situation Begins to Change; Potsdam—Failure at the Brink of Success; Frustration in London; The Moscow Conference Reaches a Stalemate; One London Conference, Two Paris Conferences; The Paris Peace Conference and the New York Peace Conference; Central Europe—A Severe Test; A Course of Action; Moving Towards Peace in Asia; Establishing a People's Foreign Policy; Control of Atomic Energy; What is the Soviet Union Pursuing? Where Do We Go From Here?</p>
<p>The final section of the third part, "Moving Towards Peace in Asia," discusses China. In the opening sentence, Byrnes wrote in a straightforward manner: "We must not forget that the Second World War broke out in the Pacific." This sentence explains the importance of Asia in the current critical situation. He went on to say: If we believe that Europe may become the tinderbox of a world war, then we must regard Asia as a very large flame.</p>
<p>Regarding China, Byrnes wrote: "China is still far from peace; all that can be said is that China is on the verge of great change, and we should encourage and assist this change within the realm of possibility. China needs our technical assistance, but China should bear the responsibility for implementation in order to achieve success."</p>
<p>Byrnes also said that China's importance is not only understood by the United States, but also by the Soviet Union. In this regard, he revealed the Soviet Union's intentions towards China. He proved that at the Yalta Conference, Stalin stated that the price of the Soviet Union's participation in the war was the joint management of the two major railways in Northeast China, turning Dalian into a free port, and establishing a naval base in Lushun. In addition, at various conferences, Molotov raised the same question: "What exactly are the U.S.'s intentions in China?" Molotov also requested that the U.S. and the Soviet Union withdraw from China at the same time. Byrnes replied that the U.S. military's presence in China was to assist in the evacuation of the Japanese, but this response did not satisfy Molotov.</p>
<p>Byrnes also described his unsuccessful discussions with Molotov, followed by a direct meeting with Stalin. Regarding this, Byrnes said: "I told Stalin that Chairman Chiang's government is the only possible government in China. The Chinese Communist Party is not a true communist party." Stalin acknowledged in his response that the Nationalist government was the legitimate government. The most interesting thing was that Stalin believed that Mao Zedong exaggerated the strength of the Communist army too much. When Byrnes told him that Mao Zedong boasted of having 600,000 troops in the Tianjin area, Stalin couldn't help but laugh a few times.</p>
<p>Byrnes's view on Asia is as follows: "The security of the United States itself and world peace depend on the progress of Asia."</p>
<p>In the preface, the publisher praised Byrnes's efforts for peace. According to him: "In the two years since the victory over Germany, Byrnes has fought for peace with unremitting efforts. He traveled a total of 77,000 miles, and he participated in a total of eight major conferences from January 1945 to October 1946, namely: The Yalta Three-Power Conference from January 22 to February 12, 1945; The Potsdam Conference from July 6 to August 7; The London Foreign Ministers' Conference from September 4 to October 8; The Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference from December 12 to 29; The United Nations General Assembly held in London from January 7 to 25, 1946; The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference from April 23 to May 18 of the same year; The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference from June 13 to July 14 of the same year; The 21-Nation Peace Conference from July 27 to October 17 of the same year."</p>

<h3>The Senate Assembly Concludes Successfully: Recovering Payments for Electricity and Other Services, Refund of Already Paid Amounts Requested, Moderate Reduction of the Price Limit for Frugal Banquets, Relaxation of Restrictions on the Use of Automobiles</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The fourth session of the Municipal Senate Council held its tenth and eleventh meetings yesterday morning and afternoon, respectively. By 7:30 PM, discussions on all motions had concluded, and the closing ceremony was held. Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating that there were two important motions in the assembly. One was the city's general budget for fiscal year 37, which was passed after review and reporting, with the city government increasing revenue and decreasing expenditures. He said that the city government's organizational structure should be submitted to the central government for approval as soon as possible so that the budget has a real basis. If the central government insists on cutting down the city government's institutions and refuses to amend the regulations, the Municipal Senate Council can only ask the city government to act in accordance with the regulations. The other important motion was the draft contract with the Joint Power Company. The enthusiastic emotions during the discussion fully demonstrated the spirit of the local council. The assembly has now decided to organize a special review committee to continue the research, hoping for careful handling to establish a model for how to use foreign investment. Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Shen Zonglian, delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu, believing that this assembly has achieved much. He also expressed admiration for the senators' tireless pursuit of details when discussing the above two cases and stated that the city government will definitely implement the resolutions carefully. Tao Baichuan delivered a reply on behalf of all senators, comparing the senators to mirrors that reflect public opinion, saying that they have not distorted anything, but still hope that the press and voters can wipe them clean from time to time. Tao also hoped that the upcoming National Congress representatives, legislators, and supervisors will become telescopes and microscopes, saying that with mutual cooperation, not only can Shanghai become an ideal city, but China can also become a new China. He hoped that voters will vote carefully. After the speech, the fourth assembly ended in enthusiastic applause. At 8:00 PM, the successful closing was announced amidst music.</p>
<p>The Senate Assembly passed many important temporary proposals yesterday. The main ones are: The price increase date for electricity, telephone, and heating services in public utilities should be changed to the date of promulgation (October 21). If citizens have already paid the amounts collected by each company from October 1, the company should deduct them from the next bill. Please ask the Public Works Bureau to complete the Hengfeng Road Bridge project as soon as possible to facilitate traffic. Please ask the Public Utilities Bureau to consider installing more street lights in the Zhabei District. The price limit for frugal banquets is too high and does not meet the original purpose of frugality. Please ask the city government to reduce it appropriately. Please ask the municipal government to recover the Sino-French School, French Primary School, and French Naval Club buildings established by the former French Municipal Council and use them for cultural undertakings in this city. The case will be submitted to the Education and Land Administration Committees for joint review. The case of establishing a health sub-office in Qibao Town, Longhua District, will be submitted to the Health Committee for review. The British-owned Shanghai Gas Company arbitrarily sets limits on industrial gas usage and imposes arbitrary fines. Please ask the Public Utilities Bureau to order the company to re-establish reasonable limits. The joint distribution of cotton yarn does not help stabilize prices and harms the people's livelihood and economy. It is recommended that the central government revise the method. When revising, please allow representatives from the Senate Assembly and relevant groups to attend and state their opinions.</p>
<h3>Letter Requesting the Municipal Government to Temporarily Unseal Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>The Tian Senate Council immediately sent a letter to the Municipal Government, stating that the crackdown on hoarding of daily necessities should strictly follow the steps prescribed in the regulations promulgated by the National Government. Before following the steps prescribed in the promulgated regulations, all revoked account books should be returned, sealed goods should be temporarily unsealed, and economic inspections of the industry should be temporarily suspended. Those who handle the case will be dealt with according to the law. For informants who make false accusations out of spite, they should be punished according to Article 20 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding.</p>
<p>Civilian houses in Wusong District were occupied by troops and military dependents. The Municipal Government was requested to forward the information to the Garrison Headquarters to order the relocation. It is suggested that the central government should supplement and relax Article 3 of the Measures for Restricting the Use of Automobiles by Private Individuals. Lawyers, accountants, architects, technicians, and public officials such as senators who are legally registered should be allowed to use automobiles for business and official needs. Private hospitals, schools, and legal entities such as various public associations, trade unions, and charitable organizations that are legally registered should be allowed to use automobiles with relaxed restrictions. All private automobiles should be allowed to be transferred to any private individual or private legal entity.</p>
<h3>The Budget for Fiscal Year 37: Total Revenue Increased to One Trillion, Expenditures Should Be Reduced as Much as Possible, and No New Taxes Should Be Added</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The general budget for revenue and expenditure in Shanghai for fiscal year 37 has been resolved by the eleventh meeting of the fourth session of the Municipal Senate Council yesterday afternoon. The total revenue has increased to 1,092,046,924,574 yuan. According to the city's population, the average burden per person is about 278,000 yuan. Expenditures should be reduced as much as possible to meet the purpose of living within one's means and seeking a balance between revenue and expenditure. The Assembly resolved the following three measures for the budget proposal: The budget should be approved in principle according to the review opinions of the Budget Committee and sent to the Municipal Government to recompile it based on the points indicated. The Municipal Government's competent bureaus should reduce various expenses, which should be coordinated by the Municipal Government. The organizational regulations of the Municipal Government should be submitted to the central government for approval as soon as possible (because the number of employees has not been approved, there is no basis for expenses).</p>
<p>Open Up New Sources of Revenue and Reduce Expenditures, While Considering Both</p>
<p>In order to review the budget proposal submitted by the Municipal Government, the Municipal Senate Council specially extended the meeting for one month on September 30. During the extension period, the Budget Committee successively invited the heads of various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government, the accounting personnel in charge, and representatives of the small committees of the Senate Council to jointly review each item of revenue and expenditure in detail. The original budget for revenue and expenditure was 985,517,924,574 yuan, but due to the adjustment of salaries for public teachers and staff in October of this year, which increased by 125%, an additional 30 billion yuan is required each month, and 360 billion yuan per year. The budget is already short of 140 billion yuan, and there will be several more adjustments throughout the entire year of 37, so revenue is not sufficient to cover expenditures. Under the principle of legality and rationality, we will slightly open up new sources of revenue and reduce expenditures to seek to increase treasury revenue and tighten expenditures. In terms of opening up new sources of revenue, we will effectively rectify the city's public undertakings so that public operations are enterprise-oriented. In terms of reducing expenditures, we should still cut down redundant institutions and save unnecessary expenses. After negotiation, the revenue department has increased by a total of 106,529,000,000 yuan, of which the most increased are the surpluses of public transportation companies, land value tax, business tax, and slaughter tax. The expenditure department should be reduced as much as possible, and redundant institutions should be cut down to save expenses.</p>
<p>Eliminate Embezzlement, Sell Public Land</p>
<p>When the expenditure on constructive undertakings and the salaries of staff and workers for fiscal year 37 need to be increased due to the increase in prices and the adjustment of salaries, the Senate Council believes that citizens have already shouldered more than one trillion in expenses and that no new taxes should be added for the resulting difference between revenue and expenditure. In addition to rectifying public undertakings to increase surpluses, the following two measures should also be taken: The Finance Bureau and other bureaus should effectively supervise the tax collection personnel and those who collect various fees to eliminate embezzlement and prevent tax evasion. When necessary, sell municipal land with smaller usable value.</p>
<h3>A Monthly Meeting Held Before the General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning, before the tenth session of the fourth assembly of the Military Service Association of the Municipal Senate Council, a joint monthly meeting was held with the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Senate Council, presided over by Speaker Pan. After the meeting, the tenth meeting of the Municipal Senate Council immediately began.</p>
<h3>The Joint Power Contract Approved in Principle, Some Clauses Still Need to Be Revised, and a Special Review Committee Will Study It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The draft contract for the operating rights of the Joint Power Company was reviewed and revised by the joint meeting of the Public Utilities and Legal Affairs Groups. It was discussed in detail at the General Assembly yesterday. Because this case is the beginning of Sino-foreign joint ventures, the senators attached great importance to it and expressed their opinions. Feng Youzhen gave an impassioned speech, emphasizing his ten reasons for opposition: Clause 3 of the draft states that within this area, except for participating companies, the government will not undertake it itself, nor will it allow other public or private institutions to obtain, enjoy, or operate the undertakings or similar undertakings of the Joint Power Company as stipulated in this contract. This is actually an act of trust. No one in the country will agree to a trust organization. Clause 6 of the draft states that the government hereby agrees that the Joint Power Company only needs to pay land and building taxes that are currently in effect in this area. Regardless of now or in the future, no other types of taxes will be levied or collected on any other type of property of the company. This is an excessive privilege and should not be tax-exempt. Furthermore, Clause 7 states that the company has the right to determine the electricity rates it deems appropriate at its own discretion. This is fundamentally absurd. Electricity rates are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood and should be restricted. The percentage of net profit stated in Clause 7 of the draft is too high. If it is discovered that the foreign company does not fulfill the contract, what will be done? Clause 9 of the draft states that after the Joint Power Company requests it, the government should requisition the land it needs for the purposes of this contract. If this is implemented, can the company arbitrarily requisition the land it needs? Clause 10 states that this contract may be assigned to the Joint Power Company without the government's approval, which is actually contempt for our government. I dare not agree with the opinion stated in Clause 10 of the draft that if the Joint Power Company issues corporate bonds and mortgages its property, including this contract, as collateral, all holders of corporate bonds will not be subject to nationality restrictions. Clause 13 states that if there is a disagreement between the two parties, the president of the International Court of Justice should be asked to appoint an arbitrator. Although the review has changed it to authorize the president of the British (third country) Electrical Engineers Association to appoint an arbitrator who is not of Chinese or American nationality, a Chinese company should abide by Chinese law and cannot request arbitration, and should be fully protected and bound by the Chinese court. The 30-year term stipulated in the contract is too long. China has no reason to provide the company with the foreign exchange it needs for the purposes of this contract.</p>
<h3>Precious Opportunity, Pity to Miss</h3>
<p>Senators Huang Shusheng and others then spoke enthusiastically. Senator Fei even suggested that this case be reserved for the next assembly. Director Zhao Zengjue immediately took the stage to report that if the contract is established, the company can borrow money from the United States. The United States is currently very interested in this loan, which would be a pity to miss. Senator Tao Baichuan continued, saying that the city urgently needs to increase electricity. The establishment of the Joint Power Company can also give the city the opportunity to obtain priority compensation for electrical machinery. Therefore, he suggested that the assembly establish a special review committee to review the case. If an agreement cannot be reached, the chairman can convene a temporary assembly to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Four Measures Finally Passed</h3>
<p>Finally, the Assembly voted to pass four measures: The draft contract for the operating rights of the Joint Power Company was generally approved according to the amendments already proposed by the review meeting. The clauses in this contract that still need to be considered will be discussed and revised by a special review committee in conjunction with the Municipal Government within half a month and sent back to the Municipal Government to be submitted to the National Government for approval. If the special review committee cannot reach a resolution, the speaker may convene a temporary assembly to decide. When the special committee reviews the case, other senators may also voluntarily participate in the discussion, and those who participate in the discussion will also have the right to vote. The Assembly appointed 37 members to the special committee, including Chuan Ruilin, Tao Baichuan, and Tang Shichang, to be convened by Fu Ruilin, Tao Baichuan, and Feng Youzhen.

<h3>Fire on Military Industry Road: China Agricultural Machinery Company, Oil Pipeline Explosion, Four Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 2:30 PM yesterday, the oil pipeline of the diesel pool in the blacksmith's workshop of the China Agricultural Machinery Company on Jiangwan Military Industry Road suddenly exploded due to excessive heat from burning. In addition to some factory buildings and more than a dozen barrels of diesel being burned, two workers, Zhang Shengquan and Wang Fuxing, were buried in the fire, and three other workers, He Xinwei, Shen Longsheng, and Zhang Yongxin, were burned and sent to Jimin Hospital for treatment. The iron-smelting section was also burned. Fortunately, the company had its own fire-fighting equipment, and the fire was extinguished after an hour and a half of firefighting. It is said that the losses were severe.</p>
<h3>Building a Peace God Memorial Tower on the Bund Requires More Than 2 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Peace God Statue of the European War Memorial on the Bund in this city was demolished by the Japanese invaders during the fall of Chongqing. After the victory, the Municipal Senate Council resolved to rebuild the memorial tower for the Zhaohe Battleship Uprising at the original site. David Tweedie, the president of the British Joint Services Association, sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting the reconstruction of the European War Memorial. The Municipal Government drafted a win-win solution and sent it to the Senate Council. The speaker submitted it to the General Assembly yesterday morning for discussion and approval. The solution stipulates that the European War Memorial will be rebuilt at the original site according to the proposal of the British Joint Services Association. The entire project is estimated to cost about 1.4 billion yuan according to the market price in June. The Municipal Government will advocate the organization of a committee to unite overseas Chinese of various countries in Shanghai to work together to raise funds, and the Municipal Government will bear a portion to show its advocacy. In addition, the Zhaohe Battleship Uprising Memorial Tower will be built in front of Huangpu Park at the intersection of the Bund and Beijing East Road to echo the Peace God Statue at the intersection of Zhongzheng Road. The design of the memorial tower has been determined to be a circular base with a triangular concave shape built on the steps. The tower column will be 11 meters from the ground to the top of the tower. The memorial tablet characters will be engraved on three sides of the tower column, and the memorial text will be engraved on three sides of the tower house. A wreath of anchors will be set on each of the three sides of the base to represent the symbol of the Zhaohe Battleship. It is estimated to cost about 700 million yuan, which will be borne by the municipal treasury in principle.</p>
<h3>A Temporary Motion to Handle the General Election Carefully Was Passed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The temporary motion of Senators Ma Junshuo and Zhou Lianze, "Regarding the handling of the general election, the government should be particularly careful to establish a democratic atmosphere and thoroughly prevent illegal contracting and coercion and inducement, so as to emphasize the basic rights of the people and lay the foundation for constitutional government," included three measures: Various elections should focus on talent. All candidates should compete fairly according to the law and thoroughly prevent illegal contracting, threats, inducements, and other behaviors that hinder elections or order. The total amount of various election ballots printed and the number of units distributed should be truthfully announced in the newspaper by the election office to show great credibility. The freedom of voters to vote freely in the election should be guaranteed. In the polling place, in addition to the police officers assigned to duty, military police and other personnel are prohibited from staying. After the Assembly decided, it was unanimously passed.</p>
<h3>Unjust Imprisonment Compensation Will Be Discussed, Release of Traitors Will Be Handled Seriously, Justice Minister Xie Guansheng Says</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a reporter consulted Xie Guansheng, the Minister of Justice of the Judicial Administration Department, who came to Shanghai on legal issues. He said: The Ministry is also paying close attention to the suggestion on unjust imprisonment compensation recently passed by the Shanghai Municipal Senate Council. Specific measures have been drafted and will be submitted for discussion at the National Judicial Administration Conference to be opened on the 5th. There are two points that must be resolved in this matter: 1. Formulate a compensation law, 2. Determine the compensation budget, because any discussion of compensation involves economic issues. The issue of releasing traitors on parole will be handled in accordance with Article 77 of the Ordinary Criminal Law, but it must be more serious and meticulous. The appeal of the families of traitors for amnesty when the constitution is implemented is an order from the Central Government and is beyond the power of the Ministry. The Shanghai District Court and District Procuratorate will find an office building. There is already progress, and it will be realized soon. The District Court and District Procuratorate will work together.</p>
<h3>Various Motions Ratified and Passed</h3>
<p>In addition, during the adjournment of the Third Assembly of the Senate Council, important motions resolved by various committees, except for the resolutions of the Budget Committee, which were of a special nature and were submitted to the General Assembly for ratification in a separate case, 124 other important resolutions of various committees were submitted to the General Assembly for ratification yesterday afternoon and were resolved and passed.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Winter Relief Funds, Passage of Charitable Horse Race, Plus Soccer Tournament and Fundraising</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Winter Relief Committee proposed the following three measures to raise winter relief funds: Issue refugee relief lottery tickets, add 20% entertainment tax, and hold a charitable horse race, and submitted them to the Senate Council for discussion. Speaker Pan handed it over to the tenth meeting of the Fourth Assembly for public decision. After an hour and a half of heated discussion, it was resolved that: The first item of the original measure should be deleted, the second item of the original measure is feasible in principle, and entertainment businesses should collect donations by proxy, with the amount equivalent to 20% of the original price, and limited to the four months of the winter relief period. Regarding the third item of the original measure, according to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, it should be submitted to the central government for approval by the municipal government before it can be held, and the name is set as "Winter Relief Charitable Horse Race" and designated for winter relief expenses. Add the fourth item of the measure as "Hold a winter relief charitable soccer tournament." Add the fifth item of the measure as "Launch fundraising from all walks of life," and so on.</p>
<h3>200,000 Refugees in Danger</h3>
<p>Before the case was discussed, Wu Kaixian, Deputy Director of the Winter Relief Committee and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, first reported the reasons for the proposal, saying that this year, the city has ten times more refugees than last year, reaching 200,000. With the approaching cold winter, they lack food and clothing and their lives are in danger. The Winter Relief Committee has decided to start receiving and providing relief from November 16, holding work relief, setting up shelters, and providing porridge and clothing. It is planned to raise 60 billion yuan as expenses. Because the business community has already donated several hundred billion yuan in recent years, they may not be able to bear the burden, so it is planned to adopt three methods such as horse racing. However, when Director Zhang Jinjing went to Nanjing to discuss the issuance of relief lottery tickets, he stated that someone had proposed issuing national charitable lottery tickets for the relief of floods in various parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, and northern Sichuan, but it was not approved by the Political Affairs Conference, and he was instructed to think of other methods. Therefore, the method of issuing lottery tickets is withdrawn today, and other items are requested for discussion by the senators.</p>
<p>After Director Wu's report, the senators spoke enthusiastically. Zhang Zhongyuan, Wang Xianqing, and others supported the charitable horse race. Fei Shusheng opposed it, believing that the First Assembly resolved to oppose horse racing, and now it is difficult to justify opening it up.</p>
<h3>Read Out the Clauses on Illegal Issues</h3>
<p>Ma Junshuo believes that although horse racing is crowned with the word "charitable," it is still illegal. If the Senate Council supports horse racing, it will help the government violate the law, and the people can sue the government for gambling. In order to provide a basis for discussion, Speaker Pan read out the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of whether horse racing is illegal, believing that issuing lottery tickets is not necessarily a crime. According to Article 269 of the Criminal Law, issuing lottery tickets without the government's permission constitutes a gambling crime. The lottery draw for this horse race was proposed by the government and will be submitted to the central government for approval after being passed by the Senate Council, so it does not conflict with the Criminal Law. Zhu Wende supplemented Speaker Pan's interpretation of Article 269 of the Criminal Law, saying that issuing lottery tickets for profit is illegal. Relief is not for profit, so it is not illegal. Zhu Fuqiu suggested that the additional entertainment tax be increased from 20% to 50% and that a charitable soccer tournament be held. There were many other senators who wanted to speak, but because there was not enough time, it was submitted for a vote. Before the vote, Speaker Pan read out the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of whether horse racing is gambling again to show seriousness. Finally, the method of raising winter relief funds was passed by a show of hands as before.</p>
<h3>Workers in the Machinery Industry Send Representatives to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Industrial Union of the Machinery Manufacturing Industry in the Fourth District, because the capital of Shenchang Yangxing dismissed three workers' representatives and workers for reasons, and also planned to dismiss 79 workers, sent five representatives to the Senate Council to petition yesterday. Senator Zhou Xuexiang and Senator Yan Esheng were appointed by the Assembly to receive them and decided to request the Assembly to send a letter to the Municipal Government to stop Shenchang Yangxing from arbitrarily dismissing 79 workers during the general mobilization. As for the dismissal of three workers, Shao Renquan, etc., and the issue of severance pay, they will be handled in accordance with the legal procedures.</p>
<h3>Public Land on Shandong South Road Investigated for Property Rights and Allocated for School Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Assembly amended and passed the review opinion on the mayor's policy report yesterday and discussed the cases submitted by Speaker Pan: Passed the Shanghai Municipal Government's measures for issuing national identity cards and raised the standard for collecting the cost of materials from 100 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Send a letter to the Shanghai Safety Promotion Association to find a way to subsidize the police as soon as possible so that they can serve with peace of mind. The Huangpu District People's Congress requested that the public land behind the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau on Shandong South Road be allocated for the construction of a school to celebrate birthdays and the site of the district office. It was resolved to investigate the property rights. If there is no problem, please ask the Municipal Government to designate and approve the allocation. The Municipal Government's bureaus and branches are included in the district office, which is difficult to implement. The South House submitted a request for reconsideration, and it was resolved to submit it to the Regulations and Autonomy Committees for joint review and then to the Assembly for discussion.</p>
<h3>A New Branch Arises in the Case of Carrying Coffins to Dispute Housing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tang Yurang, the owner of the May 30th Socks Factory at No. 190 Wuzhou Road, accused the landlord Sun Huayin, his wife Sun Fang, and his son Sun Shuihe of forcing him to move out unsuccessfully. He carried 11 coffins and a toilet to block the May 30th store and obstruct business. The District Court sentenced Sun Huayin to four months in prison, Sun Fang and Sun Shuihe to two months in prison, and all three were given a two-year suspended sentence. The case had originally subsided. However, yesterday, the Enemy Property Clearance Office of the China Trust Bureau suddenly sent a letter to the District Court stating that the house at this number belonged to the property of the Japanese Shanghai Real Estate Co., Ltd. It has been taken over by the office and stipulated that before it is sold, the original residents may be temporarily allowed to keep and use it and pay usage fees on a monthly basis. All residents had been informed of this on record. Now Sun Huayin has sublet the roof of the house to Tang without authorization, which violates the regulations and should be recovered. In addition to sending letters to Sun and Tang, each limited to returning the house within ten days of the arrival of the letter, the District Court was also requested to check and deal with the matter.</p>
<h3>Xu Youzu Approved to Resign, Police Bureau Increases Business Section</h3>

At the same time, the Municipal Police Bureau believed that the business under the jurisdiction of the Economic Section was extremely busy. In order to strengthen administrative efficiency, the economy and business were separated, and a business section was added to the original Economic Section. Cao Maoliang, who had served as a professor at the Business School, was appointed as the chief of the Economic Section, with five control units under his command: finance, cotton yarn, fuel, food, and daily necessities.

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yang Anren, the main culprit in the Jin Chao case and former Deputy Director of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, and Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Gold Industry Association, were sentenced to seven and four years in prison respectively by the High Court for corruption. Both Yang and Zhan were not satisfied and requested a retrial from the High Court. The High Court ruled to return the case to the District Court for retrial. Judge Cao Zuwei of the District Court ruled: "The request for retrial is rejected." The main reason is that after a case is judged according to the Special Criminal Procedure Law, if important evidence that could affect the judgment is not considered, and it is considered to have a major error, it is justifiable to request a retrial, regardless of the defendant's benefit. However, after careful investigation of the points raised by the retrial applicants as not being considered, most are inappropriate, and it is difficult to consider them reasonable, so the request is rejected.</p>

<h3>Fisheries Management Office and Private Fishing Industry Negotiate Sales in Fishing Market to Agree on Methods</h3>
<p>Since the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Relief Fishing Vessels have been operated by the Free Fisheries Management Office, their scope has gradually expanded. By October of this year, the amount of fresh fish sold in Shanghai accounted for almost 60% of the total revenue of private fishing vessels, causing a backlash from various private fishing companies, which believed that it hindered the development of the national fishing industry. They jointly requested the fish market to refuse to unload the office's fish cargo in an attempt to resist it. They have been in a stalemate for many days, resulting in the fish market's failure to open the auction of the fishing vessels' cargo as usual yesterday, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. It is now learned that the fish market authorities, seeing that the situation was deadlocked and both sides were suffering losses, convened a consultation. Starting today, all the fishing vessels of the Fisheries Management Office that have arrived in port, except for one with better quality goods, which will be refrigerated by the office itself, the other vessels with long-arrived and lower quality goods, due to the inability to refrigerate, will continue to unload with the cargo of fishing vessels of various private companies as usual and be auctioned as usual.

<h3>Journey to Northern Jiangsu - Victory Heard in Dongtai</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, October 31st] This year, autumn arrived with high skies and refreshing air, and the weather was normal. The vast cotton fields of Northern Jiangsu all reported good harvests. However, Dongtai, which is known for producing the best cotton in Northern Jiangsu, still has most of its cotton fields in the hands of bandits. The Da Zhong Group Township in the Ninth District of Dongtai is a cotton-producing area known for fine-staple cotton, while the Chouhu in the Fifth District and the Jitong Townships in the Seventh District are vast coarse-staple cotton producing areas. These areas have now become the bases for the bandit army in Dongtai. The Zishi County government of the bandit army and the command post of the Dongtai Border Region are located within the Chouhu jurisdiction. Furthermore, in the Zhoujia Duo (approximately 40 li southeast of the county seat), which has been occupied by the bandit army for nearly ten years, there are also small-scale arsenals, clothing factories, spinning mills, various military industrial facilities, and warehouses storing cotton, food, and various materials looted from the southeastern and southwestern townships of Dongtai County. The townships under the jurisdiction of Chouhu District are no more than 70 li away from the city, yet the bandit army has established such a stronghold in the small Zhoujia Duo. According to reports from various sources in Dongtai, the armed forces relied on by this bandit stronghold include two regiments and some militia, namely the so-called Zishi Independent Regiment and the Zishi New Regiment. The former has been described with terms such as "ferocious" and "elite" in official documents of the First Pacification Zone Command and the former Taidong Rusan counties.</p>
<h3>The End of the Bandit's Old Nest</h3>
<p>October 25th was two days before the first anniversary of the recapture of Dongtai County. The reporter happened to arrive in the area via the Zhenjiang-Yangtai Highway. On the day after the reporter arrived in the county seat (October 26th), Major General Zhang Qiaoliu, Deputy Brigade Commander of the "6615" Unit stationed in Dongtai, personally led his elite and brave Iron Light troops to suppress the ferocious bandits entrenched in the Chouhu of the Fifth District of the county, the so-called Zishi Independent Regiment. After 36 hours of pursuit and combat, they captured their old nest, Zhoujia Duo, in one fell swoop. On the same day, they searched and suppressed village by village, and successively recovered more than ten important strongholds, including Chouhu, Shijiaxi, Shenjiaduo Hougang, Baidian, and Guanzhuang. In this campaign, Dongtai County Magistrate Li Xiafu, County Council Secretary Zhang Bishui, and the heads of districts, townships, and villages who had been exiled also joined the army and entered this newly recovered area to comfort the refugees and manage the aftermath. On the 29th, the news of the victory spread, and everyone was overjoyed. Every family hung flags. The heavy hearts of the people of Dongtai, who had survived nearly a hundred disasters, seemed to lighten by half. A childhood classmate who was accustomed to preaching sent me a copy of the Iron Light Society's victory report and wrote the eight characters "The calamity of the years has ended in Dongtai" on the back. In fact, in the eyes of General Xue Zhongshu, the commander of the unit who had more than ten years of experience in suppressing bandits and was prudent and pragmatic, this was only a small victory. The facts are provided below to illustrate this point.</p>
<h3>Counting the Spoils of War in Front of Thatched Sheds</h3>
<p>It has been two years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and the recapture of Dongtai County has just reached its first anniversary. However, in this not-too-long and not-too-short year, only the people in the county seat and a few townships have been slowly chewing on the bitter fruit of victory, not knowing when the bitterness will end and the sweetness will come. As for more than two-thirds of the land and people in the county, they do not know whether the fruit of victory is sweet or sour. No wonder that on the day after the reporter stepped into this desolate city where the ancestral tombs were located, after meeting with County Council Speaker Zhu Shijun, County Party Secretary General Zhan Baohuang, County Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Zhuping, Youth Corps Director Zhai Zheng, and County Councilors Ni Shouchi, Xu Xiangzhou, Jiang Junji, and other gentlemen, when talking about the pain inflicted on the people by the bandit scourge, everyone could not help but sob. Although everyone knows that the military is very capable, the county magistrate is considered a good person, and most of the common people are honest and kind, however, if grassroots politics cannot be improved quickly, the self-defense forces cannot be organized, trained, and commanded in a way that adapts to the actual needs, and everyone does not increase their awareness of the need to be prepared for danger in times of peace, these 1.5 million fellow villagers may have an unrelenting hatred, and perhaps there will be a short-term problem. Perhaps the delicious white soup silver thread noodles, fragrant and crispy long fish, and crab meat balls will be so expensive that people from Jiangnan will not dare to eat them. This is truly a tragedy.</p>
<p>The contradictions and strange phenomena in the Pacification Zone are truly countless and endless. On the afternoon of October 30, when the reporter met with General Xue Zhongshu, commander of the "6615" unit, and Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang Qiaoliu for the second time, we made a general review of the battle results of capturing the Zhoujia Duo bandit den in front of the thatched house beside Tongyu Road. The two of them believed that the strength of the bandit army in Dongtai County was weak, but it would still take a considerable period of time to completely annihilate the remnants of the bandits and eliminate their malignant influence. They frankly said that this time, only more than 20 bandits were captured, dozens were killed, more than ten rifles were captured, more than 200 old shells, five war horses, a radio, ten spinning and sewing machines, and hundreds of shi of food and cotton were seized, and some refugees were rescued. The Zishi Independent Regiment of the bandit army has fled to Lujia Yao upon hearing the news (this place is close to Hai'an in Taizhou), and the New Regiment of the bandit army has disintegrated into smaller groups and fled into the depths of the reeds. The National Army is joining forces with local teams to step up the pursuit. However, in order to prevent this group of remaining bandits from being resurrected, it is necessary for everyone to work together and add a boost.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Suicidal Lovers, Suicide Note Found, Suicide Due to Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>[Aviation Report from Our Newspaper in Tianjin, October 30th] The case of the double suicide of Su Qingneng (aka Yi Chang) and Dong Jifeng in the Jinbei Yang Hotel was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The reason for their suicide has now been explained in the letter they sent to Dong Jifeng's parents. The original text of the letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"To our parents: We didn't think that we'd be leaving so quickly, but we can't provide for ourselves, nor can we help you. We are ashamed. It's better to take this path, so you won't worry. We are incompetent, but we can be satisfied in death if we can't live together. We hope you won't miss your unfilial daughter. We will be happy in the afterlife. We hope you won't be sad! Farewell! To our dear parents, forever health. Your unfilial daughter Xiao Feng, Son-in-law Yi Chang. October 27th. Enclosed are two pawn tickets. The coat that we pawned for 160,000 is Jichang's, and the one for 150,000 is Jidai's."</p>
<h3>Serving Sesame Cakes and Expressing Sincere Gratitude to the Army</h3>
<p>Stepping into the Pacification Zone, seeing all the progress in the military, truly strengthened our confidence that "Suppressing the rebellion and building the nation will surely succeed." The excellent military discipline of the "6615" unit stationed in Dongtai has already been widely praised, but General Xue Zhongshu still humbly inquires about the difficulties of his subordinates in Dongtai whenever he meets with reporters. The special qualities of the officers and soldiers are their ability to endure hardship and their lack of arrogance. The secret to Generals Xue and Zhang's management of the army is their mobility, agility, and ability to share the hardships of the soldiers, which is why they are able to fight and willing to fight. They deeply understand that in order to suppress the bandits in Northern Jiangsu, it is necessary to always strive for the initiative and be aware of the opportunities. When the reporter met with General Zhang Qiaoliu in Anli, he and some officers and soldiers had only slept for eight hours in three days and three nights, and they were still advancing towards their goal without rest or sleep while traversing the marshland and crossing the highway. There was no sign of fatigue on them. The two of them entertained the reporter on a bench in front of a thatched shed, eating sesame cakes. After eating, they respectfully inscribed words for the Shen Bao, which the people of Northern Jiangsu love to read. Their innocent and responsible spirit deeply moved me. After being treated to two sesame cakes, the reporter respectfully offered a sincere wish, hoping that they would succeed immediately. (Special Correspondent Fang Canglang)</p>
<h3>Yu Zisan, a Student at Zhejiang University, Committed Suicide with a Piece of Glass after Being Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou, October 31] Yu Zisan, Chairman of the Student Self-Government Association of Zhejiang University, and students E Bojin, Chen Jianxin and Huang Shimin, alumni of the same, were arrested by the local security agency in Room 52 of the Datong Hotel on the shore of West Lake on the evening of the 25th of this month. One of them, Yu Zisan, has died in prison. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Arrest</h3>
<p>According to a statement issued by the security authorities, "On the 23rd of this month, we received information from Beijing and Shanghai that two important Communist Party members, Chen Jianxin and Huang Shimin, were scheduled to come to Hangzhou on the 25th to instigate party members in Hangzhou to plot unrest and respond to the Communist military rebellion. We immediately assigned officers to investigate separately. As a result, when the Qiantang United Transport bus arrived at the station on the same day, we discovered two people whose actions were suspicious. Several young people who were waiting at the station accompanied them to a noodle restaurant for dinner, and then took a three-wheeled vehicle to the Qintai Second Hotel. After about an hour, they transferred to Room 52 of the Datong Hotel, which had been pre-booked. After investigation by investigators, it was considered that their whereabouts were suspicious. The security authorities dispatched police officers to check the room at approximately 2:00 AM that night. It was confirmed that the two people who came to Hangzhou from Shanghai were Chen Jianxin (currently a teacher at Shanghai Daozhong Girls' High School) and Huang Shimin (an employee of the Shanghai China Farmers' Bank). The young people who went to the station to meet them were Yu Zisan, Chairman of the Student Self-Government Association of Zhejiang University, and E Bojin, a student of the Department of Agricultural Economics. Important letters to and from Communist Party members, three Communist Party publications, and 495,000 yuan in cash were found on Chen Jianxin on the spot. An expenditure account for activities was found on Huang Shimin, stating that the amount was approximately 20 million yuan, with 1,309,500 yuan in cash, and various Communist Party documents and books. A secret notification, two lists of party members, and a secret letter from a party member were found on Yu Zisan. Three secret letters between party members, an outline of discussions for a Communist Party group meeting, and other important evidence were found on E Bojin, and they were arrested. Huang Shimin and E Bojin were detained in the police station, and Yu Zisan and Chen Jianxin were detained in the Security Command. After the interrogation, Yu and others admitted that they were responsible for the liaison between the All-China Student Federation and the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association, and that they were the main members of the New Tide Society and the All-China Student Federation, two reactionary organizations, and that they accepted the leadership of the Communist Party and the Democratic League. At 6:20 PM on the 29th, Yu Zisan suddenly committed suicide with a piece of broken glass. Chen, Huang, and E were transferred to the Yunyuan Court on the night of the 29th for investigation in accordance with the law."</p>
<h3>Japanese Weapons Hidden in Yunding Rock, Xiamen, People Encouraged to Excavate</h3>
<p>[Aviation Report from Our Newspaper in Xiamen, October 27] When the Japanese army withdrew from Xiamen, they secretly hid a large number of weapons in Yunding Rock. The military authorities have encouraged the people to excavate them. Yunding Rock is located approximately 25 li from the city, rising more than 1,000 feet above sea level, and is the highest peak in Xiamen. Also, Chen Gongbei, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fourth District, recently arrived in Xiamen from Quanzhou. According to him, public security is not good in various counties in southern Fujian, and scattered bandits appear and disappear unpredictably, causing great trouble. Quanzhou is a hometown of overseas Chinese in southern Fujian, and many returning overseas Chinese privately bring American-style weapons. It is estimated that the number of weapons is considerable, enough to form a division's worth of armed forces. Due to poor management, they often fall into the hands of traitors, causing local chaos. Also, it is reported that 14 villages in Heshan District of Xiamen City have been demolished by the authorities and converted into an airport. As a result, villagers have been displaced, homeless, and without a means of livelihood. The Municipal Council has specially appealed to the Municipal Government to investigate the value of the buildings demolished at that time and demand compensation. The Municipal Government has stated that it will consider this matter after receiving the letter.</p>
<h3>Examination of the Deceased</h3>
<p>After Yu Zisan's death, the forensic office of the Hangzhou District Court completed the examination and prepared a report stating: "This office has accepted the case of the suicide death of criminal suspect Yu Zisan from the Zhejiang Security Command for examination. Two pieces of glass used for suicide were found next to the body. They resembled the glass from the south wall of the prison room. In order to determine the matter, a piece of glass was taken from the window for comparison, and it was confirmed that they were the same. However, it is impossible to determine whether they were taken from the window or originally left on the ground. Furthermore, the throat wound of the corpse was very deep, and there was blood in the mouth, which proves that the throat was cut before death. There were no scars on the body, and there was no sign of resistance. There was blood on both hands, which was very bright red and came from the wound. There was a slight scratch on the tiger's mouth of the right hand, so it was determined that the death was caused by suicide before death. For the sake of caution, the court will re-dispatch forensic doctor Jiang Dayi from the Jiaxing District Court to Hangzhou for re-examination.</p>
<h3>Traffic Disrupted, Pedestrians Blocking the Road: Cars Gather on the Yangxu Line, Demanding the Right to Operate</h3>
<p>[Our Yangzhou Dispatch, 28th] The Yangxu Highway, between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, is a major transportation artery connecting the north and south of the Yangtze River. It has long been exclusively operated by the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Motor Company. After the victory, new motor companies emerged like mushrooms, including Taiyang, Shengli, Hezhong, Xinsu, Lisu, Yangqing, Jiangbei, Jianhua, Zhongxing, and others. Besides the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Company still operating the Yangxu line, Yangqing also signed a special agreement with the Jiangsu Highway Bureau to operate the Yangzhou-Huaiyin line. Last month, due to business competition, the Yangqing Company's Liuhe station was once destroyed by "leeches." Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Company, with its special rights to operate due to purchasing land and building roads, and Yangqing, having a special operating agreement, presented their case to the Jiangsu Construction Department and the Highway Bureau, ordering the other companies to cease operations. However, as this concerned the livelihoods of over a thousand employees, they appealed to the departments. As a result, Zhenjiang-Yangzhou agreed to compromise, opening up the exclusive operation, allowing each company to operate one large truck and one small passenger car per day, temporarily resolving the issue. Not long ago, Zhenjiang-Yangzhou suddenly discovered that the Yangxu line road bureau had been scattered with iron nails, attempting to damage tires. They reported this to the police station, which apprehended a suspect named Xiao Ge. The police station, considering the importance of highway transportation during the period of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, decided to organize a vehicle patrol team before the end of October to maintain highway safety. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 26th, various companies gathered dozens of cars, large and small, blocking the intersection of the Yangxu line, obstructing passing military personnel, causing a very serious situation. Commissioner Lin of the Fifth District of Jiangsu and County Magistrate Wang of Jiangdu, upon hearing the news, went to mediate. Employees of various companies immediately demanded the opening of the Yangxu line for operation and a relaxation of the restrictions. Commissioner Lin and County Magistrate Wang agreed to reconsider, but emphasized that traffic must not be obstructed, causing resentment. They scheduled a meeting for the 28th, gathering responsible parties from Zhenjiang-Yangzhou, Yangqing, and other companies to discuss a proper solution and resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>Zhejiang University Strike: After learning of the arrest of Yu, Li, Huang, and Chen, students of Zhejiang University immediately requested the school authorities to rescue them. President Zhu Kezhen and Dean Gu of Zhejiang University went to the provincial government and security organs, demanding that they be transferred to the court within 24 hours. The police局 refused because the interrogation was not yet complete. The students then initiated a signature campaign, advocating a strike as a protest. At 9 p.m. on the 29th, upon hearing the news of Yu Zisan's suicide, the students were furious. President Zhu and Dean Gu immediately led school doctors and student representatives to the scene, finding Yu dead. On the 30th, the students went on strike and held a demonstration. At 3 p.m., over a thousand students, wearing plain paper strips and led by a wreath and Yu Zisan's portrait, marched to the local court and the Security Command. They distributed leaflets and posted slogans along the way, maintaining good order. After arriving at the court, they sent representatives to petition the court. Wang Bingyi, the chief prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, received them, stating that the case would be handled impartially according to the law and allowed representatives to meet specially with Fu Bojin and the other two. At about 5 p.m., the procession arrived at the Security Command to view Yu Zisan's body. The command moved the body to an open space in Caoxieling, where students, in groups of twenty, took turns viewing the remains until 7 p.m., when they returned to school.</p>
<h3>Vietnam Stops Using Large Bills: 500,000 Overseas Chinese Suffer Huge Losses, Hope Authorities Negotiate for Compensation Through Diplomatic Channels</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, October 26th] According to a Hanoi dispatch: More than 500,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam are currently suffering a huge loss. During the Japanese occupation of Vietnam, the Banque de l'Indochine issued a 100-yuan bill. Recently, the bank suddenly announced that the bill was invalid. The bank did not fulfill its issuing credit and allow holders to exchange for new bills. Although there are no reliable statistics on the amount of bills issued, the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce estimates that 70% are held by overseas Chinese. This measure by the bank is tantamount to plundering the wealth of overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese sincerely hope that the government will pay attention to this matter and negotiate for compensation through diplomatic channels.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Statement: In view of the Zhejiang University students' strike and demonstration, the provincial government authorities issued a statement, providing a detailed account of the Yu case.

<h3>Wuxi's County Budget for the Next Year Successfully Resolved. Merchants Donate 800 Million, County Government Organizes Winter Relief and Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, October 30th] The third congress of the County Assembly will officially open on November 3rd. However, balancing the county預算案 for the 36th year is an urgent task. Therefore, it was submitted to the Financial Committee meeting on the 29th for heated review. The focus was on the surcharge on the land tax. It was originally decided that the surcharge would be 6.5升 per yuan of tax, so the land tax this year would reach 3斗05合, an increase of 8升9合4 compared to last year, which is too heavy a burden for farmers, and the warehouse capacity is insufficient. All parties unanimously agreed that it should be reduced appropriately. When Chairman Wang of the province came to Wuxi this time, he also gave instructions on the surcharge issue, stating that it should be coordinated with the budget and eliminate攤派 as the principle. Therefore, it was unanimously advocated to reduce 6.5升 by 1.5升, that is, add 5升 per yuan of tax. The reduced surcharge amounted to approximately 3 billion national currency. The source of 2 billion of which was made up from the processing surplus of the tax shell. There were still 1 billion yuan, of which 800 million yuan was donated by merchants in proportion to the business tax amount, and 200 million yuan was collected by the tax collection office under the item of autonomous donation tax. At this point, the balance plan for the county budget for the 36th year was successfully resolved.</p>

<h3>Purchasing Dutiable Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange; Regulations and Control Committee Drafting Implementation Details; All Eighteen Articles Passed and Announced at Yesterday's General Meeting; Adopting Reasonableness, Empathy for Commercial Difficulties, and Comprehensive Consideration</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Regarding the implementation details for the handling of dutiable goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange without permits, the Regulations and Control Committee drafted the proposal and it was passed for implementation at yesterday's general meeting. Our reporter specifically visited the spokesperson of the committee to inquire about the process. According to the spokesperson: "This committee is in the position of an executive body, and all measures should be based on the handling methods promulgated by the government. When the government drafted the handling methods for dutiable goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange without permits, it already considered the interests and positions of all parties. However, since the announcement, importers have suggested appropriate modifications to the handling details due to differences in their respective commercial situations. This committee generally sympathizes with the difficulties presented, so when drafting the details, we carefully considered all adoptable suggestions without violating the principles of the government's promulgated handling methods. In particular, the commercial sector faces undeniable difficulties regarding capital turnover, so limited flexibility was provided for foreign currency deposit certificates. Furthermore, considering the time required for customs clearance and delivery of purchased goods, phased payments were permitted to ensure comprehensive consideration of both legal regulations and commercial realities. We hope that all original petitioners will understand this purpose, cooperate together, and uniformly comply, so that the outstanding issues that have remained unresolved for months can be smoothly concluded."</p>
<h3>Implementation Details</h3>
<p>I. General Provisions 　Article 1: All dutiable goods that have arrived or are being shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without permits, and that should be purchased by the government according to the handling methods amended and approved by the Executive Yuan, should be handled by the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with these details regarding purchasing and distribution matters. Article 2: Production equipment directly ordered by users, falling under categories 1 and 3 (A) of the appendix, will not be purchased by the government in accordance with the handling methods. For items falling under category 2 of the appendix, case-by-case applications can be submitted to a subcommittee separately formed by the Import and Export Management Committee for handling.</p>
<p>II. Purchase 　Article 3: The cost-insurance-freight (CIF) price of the purchased goods will be investigated and determined by the Central Trust Bureau, which will issue a special foreign currency deposit certificate to the original importer as the consideration for the goods. At the same time, the importer will endorse the bill of lading and submit it to the Central Trust Bureau, so that the Central Trust Bureau or its designated person (the purchaser of the goods) can declare and take delivery of the goods. Article 4: The term of the aforementioned special foreign currency deposit certificate is three years, and the amount can be divided into different whole numbers. It will be issued in a registered manner, and with the approval of the Import and Export Management Committee, it can be transferred by the original importer to a registered qualified importer, or paid to the original customer, and transferred to a registered qualified importer. Article 5: Starting from November of this year, registered qualified importers may use the aforementioned deposit certificates to borrow one-sixth of the face value of foreign exchange from the Central Bank on a quarterly basis to pay for the imported goods within their quotas. The borrowing interest rate is 5% per annum, calculated in foreign currency, and paid in legal tender at the market exchange rate on the day of the loan. However, unmatured deposit certificates cannot be used to borrow legal tender.</p>
<p>III. Distribution 　Article 6: The goods purchased by the Central Trust Bureau will be distributed to factories or direct users as a principle. Article 7: If the original customer of the original importer is a factory user, and they have submitted a sales contract and provided proof that the foreign exchange for the payment has been paid in full, the goods may be preferentially purchased by the original customer factory user within a reasonable quantity range. Article 8: If the original customer of the original importer is not a factory user, and they have submitted a contract and provided proof that the foreign exchange for the payment has been paid in full, the original customer may provide proof of reasonable quantities for distribution to direct users or direct consumers, and they will be given preferential purchase. Article 9: The distribution method for goods imported by the original importer themselves may be negotiated and determined by the Central Trust Bureau in consultation with representatives of relevant factory users or trade associations. Article 10: When the Central Trust Bureau entrusts commercial institutions to sell the purchased goods, the original importer may be given priority for entrustment. Article 11: The prices to be stipulated for the sale of various types of purchased goods, and the markup percentages to be added to the CIF price for raw materials sold to factories, shall be determined by the Central Trust Bureau in consultation with representatives of relevant trade associations and factory user associations, taking into account the market price of the goods or the market price of the finished products processed from the raw materials. The selling prices of purchased goods do not include customs duties. Article 12: The raw materials and goods obtained by each factory shall be deducted quarterly within the quota that should be obtained. Article 13: The purchaser of the aforementioned goods will need time for customs clearance and other procedures, and the purchaser may pay the purchase price in installments as follows: (1) 25% of the total price shall be paid in cash; (2) The remaining 25% may be paid with a 30-day check; (3) And the remaining 50% may be paid with a 45-day check, which must be secured by a special foreign currency deposit certificate or a bank guarantee. Article 14: The purchaser shall handle the customs clearance and other procedures themselves. The purchaser shall also bear the storage rent, unloading and transportation costs, and customs duties. Before the above sale, the storage rent and transport costs will be deducted from the government's installment portion of the sale price. Article 15: The price at which the factory purchases the goods is based on the CIF price plus a certain percentage, and customs duties are added separately.</p>
<p>IV. Supplementary Provisions 　Article 16: If the importer wishes to re-export the goods, the 60-day period shall be calculated from the date of promulgation of these details. Article 17: Matters not covered in these details, or special matters, may be stipulated separately at any time. Article 18: These details shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

The handling firms are nine foreign firms and companies including Meian, Fujia, Wang Fulong, Duxi, Shenfeng, Jiang Laixuan, Bailun, Laili, Lianxing, and American Coke. The above-mentioned foreign cotton has been submitted by the six district guilds to the Textile Adjustment Committee for verification and handling, and a request has been made to the Central Bank to adopt the handling methods for foreign cotton that has arrived in port, and to purchase it. Representatives Rong Yixin have also been appointed to negotiate with relevant authorities regarding the purchase and other matters.</p>
<h3>Limited Trading in Chinese Stocks, Process Does Not Escape Consolidation</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday did not escape consolidation, trading was limited, and it was still just insiders trading among themselves. The process was mediocre, and the ups and downs were also narrow.</p>
<p>Early Morning</p>
<p>Xianyong Yarn opened high at 292 yuan, and Yinghui also rose sharply to 7,000 yuan. It seemed like there was strong demand when the market opened, but because the compensation materials reported in the newspapers were insignificant, there was some selling after the opening, and off-market prices were reported lower first, so it retreated to 287 yuan and 293 yuan. Subsequently, as there were many who were delivering Xianyong Yarn and buying Xianyong Yarn for immediate delivery, especially Guangbang buyers who were most eager, prices gradually rose to a high of 295 yuan for immediate delivery and 301 yuan for deferred delivery. The off-market interest rate opened slightly higher at 1 jiao 6 fen and a half and 2 jiao 1. Large investors took advantage of the situation to sell, but were still forced to drop to 2 yuan 6 and 293 yuan. Near noon, immediate delivery was seen again at 285 yuan, and deferred delivery at a low of 292 yuan and a half. The hot stocks were still stable, and miscellaneous stocks saw mutual rises and falls. Only Match, China Silk, and Jinglun still stood high, and the result was that compared with the previous close, stocks for immediate delivery, including Meiya, Tongyi, Liann, Xinyi, and Hengju, were still flat. Xianyong, Xinhuo, Huafeng, Jingfu, Qinxing, China-France, Xinhua, and Huaxin Datong rose slightly. Match, Jinglun, and China Silk rose by half a percent. Xinguang, Zhabei, Rongfeng, and underwear fell slightly. Stocks for deferred delivery, including Xinguang, Huafeng, and Qinxing, were still flat. Xianyong, Xinhuo, and Jingfu rose slightly, and Meiya fell slightly. The off-market old stocks, including Dasheng, fell slightly. Cultural stocks, bank stocks, and Wuzhou became popular again.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Both Rise Upstream</h3>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix Rises by 1.5 Million Yuan Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was in a situation where private manufacturers, limited by costs, were unwilling to sell easily. Buyer groups had a strong appetite for searching and absorbing. Dyeing and weaving factories in this street supplemented raw materials due to rising cloth prices. With both factors combined, the supply of chips was insufficient, and the market rose. Until the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn continued to rise wildly by 1.5 million compared to the previous day, to 15 million yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose uniformly. The cotton cloth market saw Fangjian raise yarn and cloth prices, and the cost of living increased, causing unusually high emotions among people from all sides. Guangdong and Hankou buyers were active, and insiders also absorbed goods. It was also heard that yarn prices were soaring, and buying interest was even stronger. Therefore, as a result, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, uniformly increased by 230,000 yuan. Serge and Zhigong custom-made cloth were very popular and also rose by about 20,000. Shilin cloth was in high demand and strong, and the markets for other cloths were also consolidating.</p>
<h3>Number of Bounced Checks Increases Daily, National Bank Sends Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Recently, the trend of bounced checks has been rampant, and the financial authorities attach great importance to it. The Audit Department of the National Bank, together with personnel from the Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance, went to the check clearing house yesterday to inspect the clearing situation. All bounced checks have been copied with the account names and dates, and stamped with "Bounced Check" to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the bounced checks. According to the person in charge of the Audit Department of the National Bank, the number of bounced checks recently is alarming. On just one day last week, there were 9,819 bounced checks, totaling 140 billion yuan. On average, more than 5,000 checks are bounced every day, and the credit of checks is almost completely destroyed. If it is not curbed, not only will the financial market be disturbed, but prices will also inevitably be affected. The person in charge also speculated that there are three reasons for the bounced checks: 1. The drawer issued blank checks indiscriminately. 2. The bank intentionally used excuses to bounce checks due to insufficient funds. 3. The bad habit of using checks on the same day they are deposited has not been eradicated, resulting in bounced checks. In view of the above three situations, if it is the first reason, it should be sent to the court for investigation in accordance with the Negotiable Instruments Law. If the bounced check is caused by the bank making up for missing orders, the bank should be responsible, and the Ministry of Finance often has punitive measures. If it is the third reason, a detailed study should be conducted on the system to thoroughly reform it, and strive to completely eradicate the trend of bounced checks in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market turned firm, and transactions began. Buyers were all yarn factories, and there were not many transactions among fellow traders. Factories took the opportunity to absorb goods because yarn prices rose and cotton prices were still flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,480 bales, and the foothold was very firm. Prices still stood at the original levels. The prices for each grade for delivery to factories were: L.S.S. 3.596 million, Fine Han 3.53 million to 3.604 million, Coarse Han 3.059 million, Shashi 3.60 million to 3.65 million, Anqing 2.81 million, Yanji 2.81 million, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton 600,000.</p>
<h3>British Exchange Rate Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US exchange rate did not move. The benchmark price for the British exchange rate was adjusted to 172,000 yuan, an increase of 4.2% compared to the previous price. The designated bank selling price was 174,000 yuan, the Hong Kong exchange rate was 10,705.21 yuan, the selling price was 11,005.21 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 12,877.01 yuan, and the selling price was 13,177.01 yuan.</p>
<h3>Money Market Stable</h3>

Didn't you say, "Sometimes when I'm more open-minded, I can catch my breath a little, and I can feel the joy of being disease-free"? Even if it's only for a moment, wouldn't it be enough to prove that when the "mind" is "open," your so-called "disease" immediately leaves?

If you can listen to our sincere advice and start today with a happy mood to welcome your living environment, I believe your so-called "disease" will definitely be driven out of the country by you.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Notes on Reading in Taipei</h3>
<p>— Tuilu</p>
<p>By chance, I went to Taipei and happened to attend the "Taiwan Provincial Art Exhibition" held to commemorate the second anniversary of Taiwan's restoration, divided into three categories: Chinese painting, Western painting, and sculpture. After seeing it, I felt that the Taiwanese people were very interested in Western painting, and they worked very hard on watercolors and oil paintings. However, the Chinese painting section really had an Eastern painting style, and it was a bit inappropriate to list it as Chinese painting. For example, Wang Qingsan's "Dajia Creek in Mid-Autumn Festival" has bright colors and smooth brushstrokes. Huang Yonglu's "Silk Shade", Cai Boxue's "Qingjiao Dog", Jin Dehuang's "Collection of Flowers and Birds", Tang Yunsheng's "Quiet Pond", Lin Yushan's "Brocade迎風", Wu Jinghui's "Music Score", Lin Zhizhu's "Quiet Suburbs", Guo Xuehu's "New Moon", etc., all have a strong Japanese painting flavor. Wu Shiming's "Heroic Wind", the stone painting is also quite skillful, and the stone spectrum in Kaihua's painting collection can be referenced. Cai Jintian's "National Hero", Xu Shenchuan's "Interior", Chen Huikun's "Taiwanese Custom Room", etc., are all similar to advertising paintings. Wu Lixiong's "Golden Flower", Wang Qingsan's "Dew", Yang Jiangbo's "Lichun", Zeng Yulan's "Hibiscus", etc. are somewhat like pattern paintings, and these cannot be regarded as Chinese paintings. You Ben'e's "Mother and Son Apes", the trunks are all painted with fine strokes without distinguishing between turns and setbacks. In terms of Chinese painting, there is no "brush". Xu Shenchuan's "Autumn Xing", Ye Yong's "Sound of Waves", Li Qiuhe's "Residual Works", Wen Changshun's "Pineapple", etc. have soft colors and good power. Wu Jinsheng's "Garden Feng", the fine money strips are very vivid, Zheng Qingpu's "Landscape" is still immature, and he does not know how to use burnt ink well. Guo Xuehu's "Yinqiu Tu", the banana leaves also do not see "brush", the melon leaves are poorly inked, and there is still a lack of charm. The focus of Chinese painting lies in having brush and ink, and then there is charm. Lin Yushan's "Xiaofeng Canlu", the willow leaves are fragmented and chaotic, Wu Jianzhou's "Swimming Fish", the ink color is flat, and the disease also lacks charm. Jiang Qingzhou's "Rural Fun", the sparrows are very beautiful. Zhu Futing's "Thousand Springs on the Tree Tops", the lining method is a bit chaotic. Chen Kuiwu's "Returning Crows in the Cold Forest", the color is slightly vulgar. Lü Qingtao's "Heroic Independence", the pine needles also have a soft and weak feeling. The above points are inevitable even in domestic masterpieces.</p>
<p>However, the painting in Taiwan Province has been too deeply influenced by the Japanese, and efforts should be made to change it, otherwise it will be a waste of many geniuses and precious time. Some people can directly specialize in advertising paintings and pattern paintings, because the painting principles of Chinese painting are too profound, and one must read more poetry and books and trace the source. Moreover, good paper, ink, brushes, and pigments cannot be bought in Taiwan. The price of domestic brushes is especially expensive (one brush costs 500,000 to more than one million national currency). It is best for the provincial government authorities to invite famous domestic painters to Taiwan to give lectures and paint, which will be of great benefit to everyone in the province.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The comments in this article are not without being too strict. Even in domestic masterpieces, brush and ink flaws are occasionally inevitable. Taiwan Province has not been restored for long, so we cannot be too demanding; however, it is indeed something that we should pay attention to. Therefore, we specially introduce and publish this manuscript, hoping that the painters in Taiwan Province will carefully adopt it and establish more contacts with the art circles in the motherland.</p>
<h3>From the Shanghai Art Movement to the Value of Huang Junbi's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The Shanghai art movement after the restoration has gradually developed due to the attention of the education authorities and the promotion of society. Especially in the past few weeks, since the "Centennial Painting Exhibition," there have been solo exhibitions by Fang Junfeng, Chen Shuren, Zhu Yingpeng, and Fu Baoshi, as well as the members' painting exhibition of the Chinese Painting Association, which are not ordinary, mediocre, superficial, and low-level works. These works entirely represent the artistic achievements of modern people, which are really incomparable to the declining and outdated atmosphere of the past century.</p>
<p>Moreover, the interest of all sectors of society in art has been strengthening and increasing day by day. Shanghai is not only the center of national culture, but is also gradually becoming the center of fine arts. Just as Mr. Gu Yiqiao said at the reception of the Chinese Painting Association, after a long period of in-depth research and hard work, artists from all over the world will bring a large number of masterpieces to Shanghai for exhibitions. Shanghai has become the center for national artists to "establish fame and set prices" and "weigh art," equivalent to Rome in Italy and Paris in France. This is comforting to our art workers, especially those engaged in art work in Shanghai, who feel more happy and excited.</p>
<p>Professor Huang Junbi of Central University recently held a solo exhibition at the China Painting Garden, displaying more than 100 pieces of landscapes and figures. From the four landscapes he imitated from the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, we can see that he has a profound understanding of Zi Jiu, Shan Qiao, Yunlin, and Zhong Gui, and only then can such lifelike works be produced. This point shows that Junbi's basic skills are admirable and cannot be compared with general writers who are innovative and trendy. From his "Manmen", "Three Gorges", "Huangshan" and other landscape paintings, we can see Junbi's creative genius, stable and sophisticated. It is definitely not a work that adheres to ancient methods and remains unchanged; it is even less a work that is groundless, boasting of transformation, and falsely accusing the ancient principles of "traditional painting methods". This kind of view, rather than being the personal opinion of the author, is better said to be everyone's common feeling, and it is not my personal flattery.</p>
<p>In the text I wrote about Fu Baoshi's painting exhibition, I once said that after his painting exhibition, the Shanghai art scene should have a new transformation. Now Junbi and Baoshi have the same excellent skills. Therefore, I also feel that the path of Chinese painting is broad, flat, and bright, and it can allow all art workers to develop and build on. The main condition is that the author needs to have a deep and sincere artistic cultivation, and then he can learn the new by reviewing the old, and win by surprise, and reach a high ideal realm. Therefore, the value of Junbi's painting exhibition also lies in this.</p>
<h3>Autumn Comes</h3>
<p>— Fu Gong</p>
<p>Outside the door, the mournful wind sweeps dust on the streets, Autumn comes, and the livelihood is shamefully meager. Old sleeves stained with pine soot, The lamp fire is cool at night, growing closer; Drunk, forgetting form, lamenting the thoroughness of politics, Dreaming of a broken commandment, cherishing the Dharma wheel. Morning after morning, ten thousand tiles are covered with frost, The mountains and rivers turn yellow, petty people are insignificant.</p>
<h3>A Record of Ding Longsuo's Copies of Buddhist Images from Dunhuang</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>The Buddhist images in the murals of the Dunhuang grottoes are the only surviving remnants of the world's oldest murals, shocking the world and renowned throughout the universe. In recent years, many painters have gone to Dunhuang to study and copy them. I live in the southeast and am thousands of miles away from Dunhuang, so I have no chance to visit this land and pay my respects to this artistic treasure. I have always regretted this. Before, I saw the Dunhuang Buddhist images painted by my friend, Layman Zhang Daqian, which were solemn and beautiful, which greatly comforted my thirst. However, what I saw was too little, and I only tasted a morsel, which did not satisfy my old hunger.</p>
<p>Li Ziding Long and his wife have been wandering in the northwest for ten years, delving into the local customs and writing about them. They personally went to the Yellow River breach to write about the flooding and impact of the Yellow River. Their paintings are as long as dozens of feet, and their courage and strength are amazing. They also lived in Dunhuang for nine months, extracting the essence of the Dunhuang murals and creating a Pure Land picture with an area of ​​400 square feet. They also copied four large Buddhist images, not only the size and dimensions are based on the original, but the color and brushwork are also not a bit deviated. Their purpose is to show people the truth of the Dunhuang murals, without adding any personal opinions to them, so that viewers feel as if they are in the Dunhuang cave, facing the images of more than a thousand years ago, which is not a great pleasure! The various patterns since the Sui and Tang Dynasties copied by his wife are also exquisite and worth seeing. Now, Li Zi will exhibit his works at the Chinese Painting Garden. Those who want to see the true face of Dunhuang murals should not miss the opportunity to feast their eyes.</p>
<p>To paint freehand, the intention is in the high mountains, then there are high mountains; the intention is in the flowing water, then there is flowing water; the intention is in the wind, rain, obscurity, and flying and diving creatures, then there is also wind, rain, obscurity, and flying and diving creatures. The so-called intention reaching the brush is the mark of a good painter. However, the realm of "intention" is extremely broad; the realization of intention is extremely profound; the key lies in conforming to "reason". If the reason conforms, the "spirit" is complete; all "momentum," "energy," and "charm" are born from this. "Reason" is the truth of heaven and earth and nature; "intention" is the beautiful awareness of man-made learning and cultivation. The structure and existence of all forms in the natural world must have their reason. We deeply observe the beauty we have cultivated through learning and cultivation, carefully examine and identify what is truly worthy of being transferred and reproduced, and then use the power of the brush to present it as a painting, releasing energy and vitality, forgetting the nature of myself, the nature of nature, and the harmony of nature and myself. Therefore, what is presented on the paper under the wrist must be full of vigor and charm. One cannot discuss this without reading ten thousand books, traveling ten thousand miles, and facing the wall for nine years. Mr. Fu Baoshi's current calligraphy exhibition features a total of 180 works. Landscapes and figures compete for beauty, ranging from large to square feet. His paintings are either as unrestrained as a tiger leaping and fighting, or as quiet as autumn chrysanthemums and spring waves, or as strong as refined gold and iron, or as profound as accumulated jade, or as elegant as spider silk in the wind. His landscapes have transformed and used the techniques of Wang Qia and Yunlin and other masters; his figures have selected and imitated the techniques of Gu Kaizhi and Zhou Fang and other masters; his selection of scenes and composition are purely based on the gains of my intention, following the principles of nature, and traveling with the creator. Imagine that when he splashes ink and puts down the brush, it is like a sudden storm, turbulent waves, and the fun of riding a raft to explore the moon and entering the mountain with disheveled hair. Therefore, his works are all full of energy and soul, and have a unique charm. They cannot be measured by ordinary methods. All great masters in the past, who established unique styles and became masters of a generation, all possessed this courage and this divine understanding. I hope Mr. Baoshi will strive for it. Those who stick to established methods and stubbornly aspire to be like the ancients will close their eyes and ears and run away after reading Baoshi's paintings and my texts, thinking that they are too crazy and that they are too pretentious. However, if these people are humble and calm and carefully consider the meaning of painting as painting, they will suddenly nod their heads in agreement with my ideas and be inspired.</p>
<h3>Introduction to the Painting Exhibition of Professor Zhou Fangbai and His Wife</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>The success of artistic endeavors is based on natural talent by one-third, and on hard work and circumstances also by one-third each. Since the Japanese rebellion, the clothing of the upper class has suffered the hardships of drifting, separation, life, and death; however, it is also a rare state of affairs for literati and scholars that has never been seen in history. Their talent depends on nature, their learning depends on themselves, and the circumstances that are greater than talent and learning depend on how well people deal with them. Therefore, during these ten years of chaos, until the day when the Japanese slaves surrendered, who has achieved success? How is their success? Those who evaluate their merits know it themselves. What I cannot help but linger and sigh for is that in the bustling arena of Shanghai today, I still often meet friends from Yongshu who escaped the disaster, and I cannot help but feel happy. Mr. Zhou Fangbai did not abandon me in the past when I was humble. When I was in Chongqing, he asked me to write about the bamboo and rocks he painted. I already knew his character and appreciated his style. He and his wife, Ms. Lu Chuanwen, are both skilled in painting and calligraphy, as well as sculpture. They have been famous for their artistic skills for a long time. Now, he is displaying his works at Jiuhuatang to ask those who know the arts of Shanghai. He was once again kind enough to visit me, and he was happy to see me as an old friend. Although I am lazy, how can I not be happy! Mr. Zhou has learned a lot in painting, and his talent is very high. He has traveled through mountains and rivers and studied characters, and his achievements are even higher than before! Therefore, I am happy to introduce him to the gentlemen in Shanghai. Carefully recorded by Zhanzhi Zhai in the ninth autumn of Dinghai.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Ancient Music and Elegant Songs Performance</h3>
<p>— Wang Rulin</p>
<p>Ancient music refers to the music of the 鼓 (drum) and Buddhist sounds. The so-called Buddhist sounds are not actually Buddhist sounds, but ancient melodies performed with silk and bamboo instruments, mixed with the sounds of metal and leather, hence sometimes called “coarse and fine ten pieces”. "Coarse" refers to metal and leather instruments, while "fine" refers to silk and bamboo instruments. In ancient China, musical instruments were originally classified into eight categories: metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, and wood. Later, silk and bamboo instruments gradually became more prominent, and music as music became increasingly monotonous. However,锣鼓 (gongs and drums) Buddhist sounds, among all kinds of musical instruments, can encompass all and produce wonderful sounds. As for metal, there are five or six kinds of large and small gongs, as well as zinc bells and cloud gongs. As for silk, there are the sanxian, pipa, tiqin (high-pitched stringed instrument), and erhu. For bamboo, there are the xiao and flute. For gourd, the sheng is used. For leather, there are the large drum, middle drum, and small drum. For wood, there are clappers and wooden fish. With rising and falling tones, fast and slow tempos, played in a mixed and harmonious way, it can emphasize all the instruments and have a unique style. It truly represents the characteristics of Chinese music. However, it gradually faded into obscurity and was no longer valued. The reason for this is that it requires a wide range of instruments and performance, and without carefully selecting skilled players one by one, it cannot be coordinated. Moreover, it takes a lot of practice to achieve success. Therefore, today, those who know this锣鼓 (gongs and drums) Buddhist sounds are extremely rare. However, Mr. Xiyuan, the abbot of Hongdou Temple, has studied this deeply and has many famous scores such as "Joyful Encounter," "Scented Pouch," "Marquis of Shou Ting," "Ten Thousand Flower Lanterns," and "Eighteen Laments." Recently, at his private residence, he invited Nian Shaogang, Shen Hengyi, Wu Lingru, Jin Daqian, Zhu Yaowen, Wang Zongda, and myself to teach ten ancient tunes. The more we studied them, the more we felt their structure was exquisite and rigorous, and we wanted to promote them. I learned that more than ten years ago, an American violin expert, Mr. Aixihan, came to China for investigation. Through the introduction of Professor Zhao Zijing of Peking University's Music Department, he went to Wuxi and heard this ancient music, praising it highly. Among them, the tune "Marquis of Shou Ting" was even transcribed in shorthand. Later, he repeatedly published articles in the English-language Continental Daily, praising it to the utmost. He also wrote to the Wuxi musician Yang Yinliu, instructing him to pay attention to the research. Mr. Yang then wrote three large volumes on 锣鼓 (gongs and drums) Buddhist sounds. Now, some of the famous players in that area have passed away due to old age, but there are still many who can perform. Now, with the advocacy of Mr. Pu Xiyuan, and the cooperation of Wang Zhongjun, Xu Jinhe, Li Jingnian, Cheng Junmou, Shen Jiuru of the Yangchun Society, Yunlou, Yang Yin, and Zhang Sheng, Shen Hengyi, Yang Hui of the Tianyun Society, we have invited these famous players to come to Shanghai. On the evenings of November 3rd, 4th, and 5th, they will perform three shows in the hall of the Hushe Building on Guizhou Road. In addition, Mr. Pu Xiyuan, Shen Hengyi, Chen Huamei, Kong Zhongshan, Shen Jiuru, Chen Baofan, Jiang Min, Peng Zhimin, Zhu Yaowen and other gentlemen will perform Kunqu opera. Ancient music and elegant songs complement each other, which is a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Yue," Yaoqun understood why I mentioned these words; "The alarm is planning to use the sound of heavy machine guns firing intermittently as a signal; the number is three two... three two... fired continuously... repeated three times. As soon as they hear it, they will launch a night attack. We are preparing to launch our attack at the same time as the night attack begins. You know, there are many innocent farmers and a few vendors in Changping who have been unjustly imprisoned by Japanese secret agents. Several of my comrades who I and Brother Hu brought from outside the pass have also been arrested. We plan to attack the Japanese secret agent headquarters on one side, and send people to attack the small concentration camp inside. After both sides have succeeded, our people will join together and give them a big stir, then disperse and retreat; we plan to retreat to the Beiyuan area near the suburbs of Beiping and regroup. After regrouping, we will go to Wanquan or Xuanhua as quickly as possible. As for how to get there, we will decide after we regroup."</p>
<p>After Yaoqun clearly explained her plan, many thoughts arose in my mind; because I had not even the slightest idea about her plan beforehand. Moreover, I had not investigated at all the extent of the Japanese secret agents in Angping, or the strength of the Japanese regular army stationed in that area. As for the common people in the Changping area, as far as I knew, most of them were of the "content with their land and reluctant to move" mentality, and not many had left. If Yaoqun's plan is realized, although our group can run away, how do we know that the Japanese devils will not take their anger out on these common people? Thinking of this, I looked at Yaoqun:</p>
<p>"I have a few questions...", I had just opened my mouth when Yaoqun stopped me with a gesture.</p>
<p>"I know what you want to ask. But what about the issue of buying Shafu?" Yaoqun said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Yes, but not just that issue..." I was about to continue, but Yaoqun interrupted me again.</p>
<p>"Regarding buying Shafu," Yaoqun said coldly:</p>
<p>"I am now a little more confident that I can command her within this area. In other words, in the past in Tianjin, she had a hold on me; now, the situation is reversed, and I have a hold on her; because she seems to have lost her claws and teeth in that area, and cannot move easily. According to my ideal, her problem can be put off until the end. Now she has to listen to my commands, so please don't worry about that."</p>
<p>"Even if your plan is carried out, have you considered the impact on the local people?" I raised this point to Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"I've thought about that a long time ago." Yaoqun seemed confident: "Mr. Yue, you have to understand this point; in my opinion, whether we launch a night attack tonight or not, the Japanese devils will treat the common people the same way. Apart from trying their best to ravage them, taking what they can take, killing whom they want to kill, and burning what they want to burn, I don't see any other new tricks. Whether we carry out a night attack or not, it seems like there shouldn't be any special impact on the common people. Moreover, with just the few of us, we can't fulfill much responsibility to protect them, nor can we protect them to the end.</p>
<p>"Do you think we have enough manpower on our side to make a stir?" This was my second question.</p>
