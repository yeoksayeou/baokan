<h3>國府通令慶祝行憲　全國各地後日一律懸旗　立院通過訓政結束程序</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕本年十二月廿五日為中華民國憲法開始施行日期，國府已通電全國各部隊，各學校，各社圖，均於是日懸掛國旗，以誌慶祝。又憲政實施促進委會以廿五日為制憲完成一週年紀念及制意國民大會決議之憲法施行日期，自應加强宣傳，以資紀念，首都方面由該曾於是日邀集在京委員舉行慶祝紀念會，各大影院加映有關國民大會及選舉新聞片，並發動南京市藝人，於是日獻藝時，加添慶祝節目，各報刋載有關憲政文字，至各省市則由政院新聞局轉令各省市新聞處發動慶祝。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立院三四三次例會，廿二日上下午舉行，孫兼院長主席，上午通過要案有：　訓政結束程序法，　戡亂時期危害國家緊急治罪條例，　銀行業戰前存款放款淸償條例，　大學法。（一·二兩項全文刋左下角，三。四兩項全文刋第二版）</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立法院廿二日下午續開會，通過要案有：　專科學校法案。　修改國際民航公約三款議定書案。　中。美使用剩餘戰時財產出售協定第六條乙節第一項規定資金協定案。　中。美兩國關於處理戰時租借物資未動用部份之協定等七種國際借款協定合約合同案。　商業曾計法案。　修正省銀行條例條文案。　國府政務官懲戒委會組織條例案。又管理成藥條例，無庸完成立法程序，公務員保險法緩議。</p>
<h3>五院組織法修正案　立法院今開臨時會審議　張羣將蒞院說明調整待遇問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立法院定廿三日最開臨時會一次，討論修正五院組織法案及公務員調整待遇案等要案，屆時除孫兼院長親臨主持外，監院子院長將出席說明監院組織法，政院張院長亦將於十一時許應邀蒞院，對調整公務人員待遇事有所說明。一日之間同時有三院院長出席，尙屬創舉，預料會塲情形必極熱鬧。又孫兼院長於廿二日會中指示，廿五日為行憲之期，修正五院組織法及其他重要法令，急待完成立法程序，除廿三日晨舉行總時會外，年內尙須開會一次，一月份則因多數委員須返原籍競選，將休會若干次，至明年度上半年國家總預算案，亦須於復會後始能討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕公務員待遇調整問題，廿二日午後再度於立院會中提出，劉盥訓臨時建議請參加待遇調整委會之劉志平報告開會經過，劉氏當起立報吿稱：該會先後曾開會六次，五院院長對立院所提原則，一致贊同，待遇調整技術部份，經詳商後，亦巳有具體決定，張院長於北方南旋時，對本院提案曾表贊同，惟此案自提出至今，先後已歷三月，公務員待遇之需要調整，在今日實屬迫不及待，不識張院長對文武職人員痛苦是否知悉，若已知悉，何不早謀解決，張院長當日諾言是否能予兌現，凡此問題皆有待張院長解釋，謹建議誚張院長蒞院說明。又公務員待遇調整事，國務會議廿六日開會時，將予討論，所作決定若難令人滿意，吾人當再有所表示，劉氏報告學，會中僉認此事重要，決於廿三日晨臨時會請張院長蒞院說明。</p>
<h3>立法院例會通過　中美間貸款合約　包括購器材輪船期等七項</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立法院廿二日三四三次例會通過外交案多件，其中重要者有：　中美兩國關於處理戰時租借物資未動用部份之協定。　中美買賣剩餘軍用物資合同。　中國向美購買修理鐵道器材貸款合約。　中國向美國購買輸船貸款合約。　中國向美購買發電機貸款合約。　中美煤鑛設備借款合同及　中國向美購買發電機貸款合約之修正簽約等七種國際借款協定合約合同。七種協定合約中除「中美買賣剩餘軍用物資合同」係由政院前院長宋之文於去年八月卅日在滬與美國外物資淸理員馬開白簽定者外，餘均係於宋氏主持下：由我政院物資供應委會駐美物資供應處主任王守競分與美國國外物資淸理委會副主委倫尼及華盛頓美國進出口銀行總理馬丁與秘書歇武德，於去歲六至八月間在美簽定，最後第七項修正簽約，亦係於本年四月十七日由王氐簽定，以使第五項電機貸款之撥付時限延長半年，至明年六月底止，前六種協定合約中，第一項包括物資之總値，共五千八百九十萬美元，自本年七月一日起，分三十年償淸。第二項包括物資之總值達五億八千四百萬美元，其中一部已宣布為剩餘物資，中國為接受此項物黃，應撥付五千五百萬美元之款項。第三項鐵道借款額一千六百六十五萬美元，第四項輪船借款額二百六十萬美元，第五項電機借款額八百八十萬美元，第六項煤鑛借款額一百五十萬美元，四項貸款總計二九四五萬美元，均約定自一九五一年十月一日起，為第一次還本期間，以後各以半年為期，分二十次，三十次或五十次還淸，此等協定合約合同等，現已大部執行。又上月十日在京中美變方根據第二項協定之規定而簽訂之中美關於設置美國在華敎育基金協定，亦已於會中通過，完成立法程序。</p>
<h3>淸償戰前存放款　兼顧銀行與存戶　劉通說明條例審查經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕銀行業戰前存款放款淸償條例，業經廿理論言，本案固非很好辦法，但舍此而外，尙難謀得更佳方案，其理由有下列各端：　戰事發生出於不能預料，不能歸責於某一方，即無從判明其應歸負担。　戰時雙方均有蒙受損失，自應雙方兼顧。　照目前情形而言，若偏於存款者，則銀錢業不能負担，結果必致破產，若不顧存款者利益，而戰後利　高漲，銀錢業偏享利益，亦非情理之中，本條例兼顧雙方，尙不失之遠，　銀錢業尙未淸償之款，巳知者有四十億，尙有苦干未知及銀錢業放款，似此鉅大款額，不早解決，必致糾紛不巳，雙方均有不利。　法院適用復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條之規定，隨時隨地小同，亦非劃一辦法，徒增糾紛，不足解決。　宣戰以前貨幣相當穩定，自此以後，名種情勢變更，幣值乃趨跌落，　宣戰前為標準，尙非無據。　活期與定期不同，因活期隨時可提，定期不能提出，將兩者利息加以分別，亦於情理兩合。</p>
<h3>新任三立委　首次出席院會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕新任立委端木愷，吳紹　，王新衡，廿二日最首次出席立院例會，當秘醫長樓桐孫介紹端木愷等與會衆相見時，全場報以熱烈掌聲。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕國民黨巾央紀念週今日上午在中央黨部舉行，戴委員傳賢領導行禮後，即由國防部代部長秦德純作軍事報告。秦氏首述剿匪近况，謂東北共匪近以廿餘萬人，發動第七次攻勢，在遼北遼南及遼西三路進攻　陽，其企圖在截斷北路及孤立瀋陽，但由於我方之充分準備，其失敗定如過去多次攻勢而無異。大別山劉伯承殘匪建立根據地，威脋武漢，破壞交通之企圖，亦由於我大軍之圍攻而消滅，衆匪刻已散　。其餘鄂豫等地之殘匪，亦在國軍截擊澈底消滅中。秦氏並報吿復員軍官之安置情形，廿八萬餘之復員將校尉三級之軍官，均分別留用，轉業，或退役，辦理完竣。其次，武職入員之待遇，由八月起已依文武職人員待遇比例調整，武職人員生活已較前大加改善。</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕財長俞鴻鈞稱，除非對華之車事援助及經濟援助雙管齊下，否則二者中任何一稱援助，皆不能眞正生效。據稱，援助國民政府軍隊之剩餘軍事物資，乃為有限制之價值，除非能提高士兵之俸　而振興士氣。政府軍隊在不足够之配備下與共軍作戰，共軍將繼續破壞交通，擾亂全國經濟，在此時期內，單獨之經濟援助，大部份乃無關緊要。俞氏又稱，龐大之軍事費用繼續不斷付出，則第一步穩定幣制之希望甚為渺茫。吾人對緩和通貨泛濫所為之事，厥為理由生產，加稅，减少支出而增加國內之收入。事實上改革幣制乃當然必需之事，但通貨泛濫之根本原因，不能消滅，而發表新幣制或改變目前貨幣之價值，將使此一問題更趨複雜而無濟於事。</p>
<h3>賠償品價配民營　申請書即可發出　顧葆常稱賠償物資可供利用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨以民用日本賠償物資之估價出售問題，詢諸因公來滬之經部工業司長顧葆常，承答稱：將來賠償物資出售於民廠之價格，悉由估價委員會決定。此委員會正在積極籌組中，不久可正式成立。此會包括委員九人，其中經部三人，財部二人，全國性工業團體代表二人，全國性商業國體二人，邀請書即可發出。分期付款之原則當已決定，至於詳細辦法及契約之訂立等，尙待將來補充。申請配給賠償物資之申請醫，格式早經擬定，目前正在大量印製中。短期內即可發交各地之市政府及工商輔導處，廠家均可按一定之手續申請。因首批之賠償物資為工作機器，故申請之方式為由各廠個別申請，將來有整個設備運來時，申請方式可能有變更。顧氏對外傅賠償物資中大半均為不堪使用之舊物一點，力加否認，指為此係別有用心之論調。其目的無非欲無償而取得賠償物資。顧氏謂：「據本人所知，首批物資之中，僅有三分之一缺乏零件，我國不擬加以接受，將來此部份價値，仍可算淸後於總賠償價值內扣除，並非在抽籤抽中之後，即需强迫接受之謂。政府之價售賠償物資辦法，目的自在增裕國庫，如欲無償取得，則政府可撥給交通部及資委會，不必以民廠為對象也」。辭於本市廿四家造船廠要求承辦日本川島造船廠事，顧氏認為，如該廠設務運華，自可由民營船廠承辦，但目前取得賠　物資已改用抽　辦法，故事先</p>
<p>無把握之可言。</p>
<h3>協助處理賠償物資　盟總專家分批來滬　康培爾等抵京公幹</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕盟總為明暸我國接收賠償物資之準備起見，決定派專家十餘人分三批來華調查考察，名單已送達我國有關機關。目前來華之康培爾及貝爾塞兩氐為第一批，聞本週內尙有高齡之專家一人來滬。康貝兩氏在華約有一週勾留，渠等此來，亟欲獲悉我國工業戰時損失之確數，但因我國區域廣大，調查困難，未能列舉確數，但各項工業生產力之損失資料，我方已充分提供。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕盟總專家康培爾，貝爾塞，廿二日晨七時抵京，與我關係國當局商討有關處理日本賠償品問題，下午四時赴交部與該部官員就日賠償品運輸問題交換意見，晚應交部宴。廿三日晨將與資委會官員交換意見。渠等此行為瞭解我國工業現狀及需要，並特別注重電力，紡一織各業。渠等定廿三日午後飛滬轉返東京。</p>

<h3>歲寒念災黎</h3>
<p>經一次大雪之後，上海的天氣變成了　　。日來雖然放睛，而　氣　　。西比利亞的　流於十五日傳到上海，　實曾降至　氏零五。七以下。據天文台報告，如此嚴寒，除民十四以外，為七十年來所未有。凡此種寒流將繼續向本市侵襲。耶　及元且，均將在戰寒中度過。</p>
<p>歲寒，對於某一都份人，未嘗不是一種時令的點經：居則大廈，裝有水汀火爐，行則新軍，可以安坐疾馳；着重表，　珍　。寒威並不能對之作絲亳威脅。而瑞　繽紛，粉裝大地，更可視為娛情的美景。且耶誕新年將　，正忙於備酒食，宴賓朋，作通脊的事樂。至於一般市民，在生活高壓之下，熙來　往，　　謀利，雖深為歲舉所苦，然尙不致危及生命。而最受寒威所欺凌者，實為成千成萬貧苦無吿之災黎！</p>
<p>在市區的任何街道，任何角落，都可以看見抱胸抖瑟的災黎：他們終日食不果腹，衣不蔽體。在人行道上「告地狀」，在橋顯推三輪軍，在街上伸出瘦　的手向行人行乞，在深巷隱　處　身　臥，尤其當夜深人靜時，在菜市場，在屋　下，相擁而臥，不斷地受着北風的侵製，往往一夜之間，死者數十人。這眞是一幅人間地獄的嫁　！</p>
<p>同是上海的市民，一部份視歲寒足以賞心娛情，另一部份在歲　時犧牲了生命，這眞是一種強烈的對照。</p>
<p>在近代的都市中，富者愈富，貧者愈貧，本來是一種通病，而在中國的上海，這種情形顯得更尖院。這成羣的災黎的造成，不外八年抗戰，受維者迄未復原，和二年動亂中，共匪殘忍的破壊的結果。去上海不達的大江以北，即有共匪和潛伏土共的　擾。在他們無情的「淸算」，「鬥爭」，「槍糧」，「參軍」等等活動之下，富者成為淸算的對象，貧者成為裏脅的對象，使廣大的農村陷於生產崩潰，人民流　之境。在遭些區域的人民，無衣無食，朝不保夕，　轉來到上海，以冀有謀生求援的機會。但是上海不但沒有給他們諜職　的機會，甚至於沒有給他們有立足之餘地，於是他們的命運，不堪設想。</p>
<p>當然，救濟災黎的根本辦法是戡平共匪，使人民能安居樂業，使廣大的農民，能大家回到農村中去。但是　亂工作不是短期內可以完成的，而救死扶傷，迫不及待。所以在根本解決沒有完成以節，枝節的捕救，在目前實為最　迫的要務。</p>
<p>上海市的冬令救濟工作，在市政府及社會人士積極推動之下，巴台　開，目能所在舉辦者計有下列各項：</p>
<p>九張名片在各戲院義濱，預計可收入二百億。</p>
<p>房屋　費，可收人三百億。</p>
<p>據吳市長本月八日談話，巳籌傳二百億。</p>
<p>以上三項收入即達七百億，較原定六百億似乎巳有超出。</p>
<p>至於救濟情形：　設庇應所三屬，共可容四千五百人，現已收八百餘人。　工振庇察所十一處，約可容三千人。　市府協助慈善團體，於明年一月一日起設施粥處十一所，每日可施一萬五千名。此外關於醫病及收屍，亦均約同公私慈善機關辦理中。</p>
<p>我們假定上海急待救濟的災黎為七萬人，即七百億之數，每人可得救濟費一百萬元，三個月的歲寒難關威可勉强度過。不過目前還是開始，欲求其完成上述的目標，還有待於我們不斷的努力。</p>
<p>我們必須指出，目前熱烈從事救濟工作者，除市政府的積極推動外，其踴躍輸將當反多為中小市民，而富商大賈之慷慨解　者，至今尙未多見。救濟災黎，是　於人類的同情心，是基於同胞愛，是維持社會的安寗，是使不願受共匪奴役的人民得到生命的保障，和精神的溫煖，也就是間接動員戡亂。我們希望政府和一般市民以最大的熟忱和毅力完成冬令救濟的工作，更希望富有者能激發天良，市政府對富者提出有效的捐輸辦法，將他們的過多的財富。用之於　斃的災黎的身上。</p>
<p>房恩的報道</p>
<p>美國合衆社亞洲分社經理房恩氏，於上星期內，與本市中美高級官員會談，獲得一個結論，認為美國如對中國國民政府宣佈廣泛之援助訂劃以攀潰中共，則蘇聯勢必退却，不致出面干涉中國的內亂或以武力援助東北及華北之共軍。其所特的理由有下列各點：　蘇聯雖會將自東北朝鮮日軍所護得之軍械彈藥接濟中共，現仍可能將有限之接濟品經由海參威大連等港運交中共，但蘇聯尙不能因欲控制亞洲而　與美國全面衝突之危險。　美國若對中國國民政府宣佈廣泛之援助計劃，則蘇聯對此必然發動大規模的宣傳攻勢；但中美兩國可以正式指出，蘇聯不僅未能遵守雅兩達協定，將旅順大連開放，抑且忽視中蘇同　友好條約的規定，拒不將旅顧大運移交中國，如此即可抵輪蘇勞的宜傳攻勝。　中美爾國並可在聯含國機構內，　其他各國嚴表共同宣言，指　蘇聯在東北之行動，足以構成對於和平之威脅，如此在外交攻勢中，就　制勝蘇聯。</p>
<p>我們看了房恩氏的報道，使我們恍然大悟，美國對於援華問題，尙有所顧忌，不是恐怕美國國內人民的反對，而是　　蘇聯的干涉。房恩氏的解釋，在針對這一點上，自屬實之成理，頭頭是道。胆是由我們看過來，認爲美國憂　蘇聯的干涉，是根本不必要的。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰之後，國際舞台上的主要角色，只有美蘇兩國。美國處處以世界和平為懺，不論是在歐洲或是在亞洲，均希　和平能够締造成功，所以無往而不採取謹　忍　的態度；但在蘇聯則惟自身的安全是求，不論是在歐洲或是在亞洲，均希望其勢力的無限擴張，造成安如泰山的「安全地帶」。蘇聯在歌洲已有其樹立的鐵幕，在亞洲也巳有其樹立的鐵幕，但以其重點而論，點然偏重在歐洲，是非常明顯的。蘇聯所以要組織新共產國際，所以要堅決反對美國的援歐計劃，在倫敦外長會議中所以要採取不妥協態度乃至甘心使四國外最不歡而數，完全是為了要擴大蘇聯在歐洲的勢力，俾與美國相抗爭。至於蘇聯對於亞洲，雖然也懷有同樣的野心與企圖，但是亞洲的局勢撰歐洲的情形，不盡相同，其中最大的一點，就一亞洲有中國在。</p>
<p>今日之中國，雖因共匪稱兵作亂而發生內部的紛擾，但是中國政府不僅仍能控制全國，而且也是唯一的合法政府，其所採取的一貫的外交政策，也決不因內在的問題而有所改變。依照我國的基本政策，不僅願與美國保持友好密切的關係，而且也願與蘇聯保持友好關係，只要蘇聯眞正能够遵守及履行中蘇條約所規定的義務。所以在任何國際會議中，每過到美蘇爭執不下的時候，我國終是居間調處，提出折衷方案，以調和雙方的意見。蘇聯對於中國若無其他企圖，則對於中國似不能有不友好的行動，何况今日之中國，獨立完整，內政絕不容許他國干涉，所以美國援華，無論如何不必顧慮到蘇聯的。</p>
<p>惟中國問題的　結，乃在中共的稱兵作亂，企圖在經濟上拖垮國民政府；亞洲的隱憂，乃在中共的勾結蘇聯，組織遠東共產國際，企岡使整個的亜周也漸漸完全落在蘇聯的鐵幕之內。美國外交當局應該認淸遠東的危機，足以構成世界的亂源，威脅世界的和平，千萬不能再事徘徊瞻顧，躊躇不決。中國古人有句老話：「當斷不斷，反受其亂。」時機已經萬分迫切，援華已刻不容緩，我們希望美國當局對於房恩的報道，能予以密授的注視！</p>

<p>學津達道達德新解  嚴羣　　中庸曰：「天下之達道五，所以行之者三。曰；君臣也，父子也，夫婦也，昆弟也，朋友之交也，－五者天下之達道也。知·仁·勇·天下之達德也；所以行之者，一也。」斯言也，乃吾國數千年來·社會秩序·倫理　礎，之所託寄。請就管見所及，作一新解，質諸學者。　　達者通也，這猶路也，達道猶通路也。「天下之達道五」，猶云萬方萬民所共由之路有五。五者亦稱五倫，倫即今世術語謂「關係」者也。意謂人類於此五稱關係之中，發展其性能也。古今政制，君民異主，此特形式之殊，揆其精神，國與民之關係，古今未嘗異也，然則君臣之倫，國與民之關係耳。父子。夫婦。兄弟·家庭之關係也；若夫朋友，則社會之關係已。故曰，人類之關係，國·家·社會，三者盡之矣。盡其性，展其能，俾是五者之關係　於美備之境，則國治，天下平而人道進矣。　　所以行此達道者爲達德。達德云者，人所同得於天之本能，性之所固有，屬內者也。達范，則人受生於宇宙間，所踐履之途，腦外者也。以此達德行此達道，斯天職盡，而人事備矣，知之爲德，所以辨是非，別善惡，於以明倫理者也；仁之爲德，所以善惡相感，欣戚相關，於以　人倫者也；勇之爲德，所以强固其感通，而持之弗遂者也·要而言之，知者判別之能，仁者惑通之性，勇者推動之力。非知，無以見倫理之當然；不仁，則倫渙，無勇，則人倫之事不行。　　朱子注知仁勇曰：「知，所以知此（案指達道，下周·）也；仁，所以體此也；勇，所以強者，猶口語所謂「體會」，「體貼」，謂以我之身設人之身，恍通」，今世術語謂之「同情心」。同情心者，英語謂之Sympathy原於希臘語之Sunpatheia　sun者言「與」言「共」，Patheia根於Pathein，感也，受也，合之，猶云「感受與共」，痛　相關之謂也。夫如是，有不啻一身同體者矣。故言人倫，而標仁字之義，則身分彼此者，心相惑通，若一體然。至張橫渠言「民苔同胞，物吾與也」，可謂揭之如日月矣。　　且古者有事君如父，移孝作忠，之日，故君亦稱「君父」；又有視臣如子之義，故臣亦稱「臣子」。是以國爲家，民之於國，如處一家之中，故先王以孝治天下，而天子有家天下之言。至若朋友之交，記有之日：「年長以倍，則父事之，十年以長，則兄事之‘，五年以長，則肩隨之。」（禮記曲禮）父之行，以伯叔稱；子之　，以子　呼。則社會猶家庭也。此非私邦國而狹社會也，蓋唯以邦國社會爲一家，然後其民相親相愛，而善惡相感，苦樂相通。此吾儒言仁之實也。　　「達德三，而所以行之者一」。「一」者何？朱子以誠常之，是也。蓋下文有云：「在下位不獲乎上，民不可得而治矣；獲乎上有道，不信乎朋友，不獲乎上矣，倍乎朋友有道，不順乎親，不信乎朋友矣；順乎親有道，反身不誠，不順乎親矣」。所謂在下位獲乎上者，君臣之倫所有事業；信乎朋友，友朋之倫所有事也；順乎親，父子之倫，推而至於夫婦，昆弟，之倫所有事也；而順親至道在於反身而誠。獲乎親，順乎親；於反身而誠，－於斯可見，行夫五倫之事，出於知·仁·勇·之途固矣，茍不一貫之以誠，亦復無濟也已。誠者，口　所謂「認眞」也。認之爲言，職也。識理必眞，知之事也；既識其理，復以眞實不茍之態度推而行之·行之事也。知·仁·勇·二者一出於誠，則所以爲知無不眞，所以求仁無不實，所以行勇無不當，而所施於五倫之事無不備矣。區域設計　富裕國計民生的藍本  李春芬　　國計民生的富裕，是靠了建設來獲致，而建設的成功，又是以計劃的善宜與否做條件。因爲國家建的工作，決不是空中構造樓閣，而是須要根據實際的環境，作有計劃的開發，這就是說，國家雞設的規模，一定要以區域建設做基礎，分析各區的實際環境，針對各區的特殊問題和需要，定出各種計劃，以爲區域建設的張本。如此才是國家建設的要圖，國計民生的基礎，才能深根固蒂。所以區域設計（Regional　planning），乃是區域建設或發展（Regional　developmenl）的一種必不可少的基本步驟。　　區域設計的性質：區域設計，頗多以政治區域作空問單位，道是很不切合實際的，因爲一個國家的資源，在類別上，固多因地而異，而量的方面，又是分佈不均；而國土以內的地形，氣候，水文，土地利用以及民情等，並不因縣界省界的橫越，而遽然改觀。所以開發和合理利用的計劃，一定要因地制宜。換句話說，設計定策，應和實際的自然或經濟區域配合，所以區域設計和發展，從地理學的角度看起來，是在區械的自然環境上面，蓋上一層新的人文建施，使二者分佈的型式，和諧調適。因此，舉凡和區域繁榮有關的各種因素及其相互間的關係，　加以澈底的分　，和綜合的研究。這也就是　：一切建設工作的設計，必須根據區域本身的固生。　不但央造設計的內容，並且也在州定區域的空間範疇。如次政治區域作爲設汁單位，將　吏一個共司個體，支離破碎，整個區域的開發或問題的解決，不能通艦籌算，結果，支支節節，顧此失彼，有時因爲利害衝突，問題不得解決，常引起無窮的糾紛。　　區域設計的地理　礎：以上曾提過，區域本身的性質，決定區域設計的內容，而區域個性，又各不相同，所以設計的項目，也就相互異趣。不過設計定策，都是以地理背景做基礎。舉凡區域以內的自然和人文的要素，動的靜的，都是硏究考查的對象。達，力源，物產，交通，人口，都市等，均包括在內。任何一種要　，都要從　的性質，分佈的形式，和影響利用或被利用的情況三方面加以澈底的分析和研究，探知區內種資源的利用，是否和自然環境協調，有沒有地盡其利，有沒有浪費或越軌濫用而招致惡果。過分和不足，都不是健全合理的象徵，而有改進或重新規劃的便要，務使資源的開發和利用，與其直接的環境，發生和諧的關係。　　關於人文要素的動向，如人口的移動，工廠的遷設，貨品的運輸，在設計中，應因勢利導，使其動向，納於正常的軌道之內，在造福於整個區域的原則之下，盡最高的效能，不可坐視其自生自滅，聽其自然。此外，凡與本區繁榮有關而牽涉他區的問題，也應兼　並顧，譬如某一沿海商港，因過分膨脹，而惑覺市區人口過度稠擠與交通運輸的非分　塞，這兩個問題的解決，必須與附近其他的城市和港口，取得聯絡，一方面計劃如何疏散過多的人口，一方面對於貨物的集散，作合理的調整，以免頭重腳輕，妨害都市健康。　　區域設計的重點：以上所論，多偏重於經濟開發的區域設計，惟設計的重點，各地不盡一致，有的着重於政治管理，社會福利，濟開發或國防建設。譬如法國爲了便利政治單位的管理，其區域設計的重點在於政治，西伯利亞亦然。又如我國胡煥席與洪　兩位先生的重劃省區，也是以政治爲重點的區域設計。以經濟開發爲重點的，美國可爲代表，TVA即爲一例。我國進行的YVA和KVA，也屬於這一類。目前各國盛行的都市區域設計，是在改善都市的生活環境和增進各性能區的發揮，如防止汚區（Sium日）的發生，减少交通運輪的擁塞，以及建設新的衛城以减輕都市人口的過分密集等，其重點是屬於社會方面。英國的所謂美化城市運動（Garden　citymovement），重點亦在此。　　戰移各國區域設計的動態：歐洲各國，因直接受戰禍影嚮，市鎮村集，多被破壞，人民流離失所；而美洲方面，尤其是北美，則因都市人口增加，居住問題，亦感困難。所以最近兩年來，歐美區域設計的活動，多集中於市鎭的計劃發展，和解決房荒的問題，中央和地方的設計機構，合力推行，以謀原有市鎭的恢復，擴展，或重建。一九四六年，美國四十八州中，有二十八州，通過了市鎮建設的法案；同年英國國會，也通過了設立新鎮的法案，預計建設二十個新鎮，其中十個，是在倫敦市區的附近，目的在疏散倫敦市區的擁擠。歐大陸各國，雖受物資的限制，而市鎮設計的進行，亦不後人。蘇聯若干市鎮的建設計劃，早於一九四五年通過；法國亦已開始積極推動市鎭重建計劃；意大利於去年成立了一個聯合設計委員會，主持建設災區的各種計劃。其他如波蘭之華沙，荷蘭之鹿特丹等，也正在設計亟謀恢復，市鎭設計，在最近兩年中，可算是風起雲湧盛極一時的了。危險的人物？柏格森  幼偉　　現代法國哲人柏格森（Henrl　Bergeol）。在我國思想界上是一個熟知的人物。他的主要著作，如「創化論」，「物質與記憶」，「時間與自由意志」，「形而上學序論」等，都有中文的譯本。他會一度受我國哲人熱烈的崇拜。可是現在他似乎被我們遺忘了。　　我們雖忘記了他，法國人却沒有忘記他。柏氏逝世之後，（他是在一九四一年逝世的），他的著作反而流行起來。讀他的審的人，日見增加。凡思想左傾的人都喜歡讀他的書。柏氏的崇拜者已由學府中轉移到十字街頭上去了。所以最近　國政論家立特曼氏（Walter　Lippmann）名他爲「世界上最危險的人物」。　　柏格森危險的人物！道不免令我們吃　。他的思想並不左傾。他不像英哲羅素（Bertrand　Russell），尙有多少同情蘇聯或共產主義的　論。他在政治上很少主張。他也不是反對　敎的。他的危險性何在呢？他的危險性乃在他的哲學。哲學上，他主張一切皆變，一切苦在遷流不息中，沒有永守故常之一物。時間之流的前進，是創新的，聯續的，堆積的，一剎那便有一剎那不同的狀態。在這種主張下，政治，社會，宗敎，道德，以及一切風俗制度，自然也不能例外，而須受時問之流的改變。換一句話說，他是主張推　現狀的。凡不滿意現狀而思推翻現狀的人，便自然而然的傾向他了。目前的法國人或多不滿現狀的，柏氏所以受歡迎者在此，而其危險性也在此。　　我不敢說，柏氏的思想是危險，因爲和他有相同主張的人却很多。假如是危險的話，這又證明思維是有力量的，是可以影經社會或改變存在的。人口的蕃殖  方正　　人口按幾何級數增加是理所必然的。因爲兩個變成四個，則四個便必變成八個了。問題是一般人很難想像到人口依幾何級數增加時，人口蕃殖的速度可到如何地步。除非用一個具體的例來說明，一般人也許難得領會人口蕃殖遠景的嚴重性。　　我們姑認爲中華民族是五千年前才移或才產生在今日的東亞的。我們姑假設中國的人口是自古至今按蒲一個常恒的比率蕃殖着。即使這個比例很低，低到每年祗增加千分之七，那就是說，一千個人在一年後，除掉了死亡的，尙剩下一〇〇七人。這也等於說，在一百年後一千人會蕃殖成爲兩千人。一百年人口祗增加一倍，蕃殖率並不高，因爲西歐在十九世紀就增加了這個數目，雖然十九世紀在西歐有不斷的戰爭，革命，饑饉與疫癘。在美國的一個落後地區Ruerto　Rico，這一個島上的居民，雖然醫藥落後，死亡率高，但每年的蕃殖率是百分之二點三，即在三十年中，人口便增一倍。一百年是三四代，三四代增加一倍人，這個比率實在不算得高。但如果按着這個比率蕃殖，則五千年前我們的祖先即使祇是兩個人，到了五千年後的今日，我們人口便要超過兩千萬億，即二千萬萬萬人，比今日整個地球上的人口，還超過一千萬倍。有些人懺憬着將來的世界是不愁吃愁穿的，但兩千萬億的人可要多少地皮居住？科學即使進步，地球整個陸地面積（約五千一百萬方英里）不論冰寒暑瘴，高山荒谷，都可住人，要使二千萬億的人口，都得着三尺寬六尺長的一蓆睡覺地面，也除非全世界都荒上像紐約城的三十層會的大廈，一點隙縫都不要，我們這個大民族才會得着寢處。這以外，飲食起居都沒有地方，文化與享受更不必說。這樣的世界自然是不可能的。　　所以人口是無論如何必加以限制的，不論這種種限制是自然的或人爲的。過去限制人口過分蕃殖的自然是饑荒與戰爭。疾病與疫癘。有些人甚至相信這使進步或演化的主要原因，所謂自然淘汰，汰弱留强，種族才右進步。這種演化學說在現代發生學的種種事實前，已經早站不住脚了。我們希望人類自己能掌握住自己的命遝，饑荒疫病應該　着科學的進步而從世界放逐出去，戰爭也希望總可以設法避免。限制人口蕃殖便應該操之於人了。　　過去的事實告訴我們，節育運動（人爲的生產限制）曾產生極不良的結果。這就是所謂不同生殖率Diferential　fertiliy。越優秀的蕃殖率越低，越愚昧貧窮的，蕃殖力越高。例如美國一九三五年的城市人口統計。年入逾三千元的，其生殖率爲〇，四六（換言之，即生殖率增高一倍，仍不能維持人口的不减）。年入自一五〇〇到二〇〇〇元的，其生殖率爲〇·七〇；年入不及一千元的，其生殖率爲〇·九三。所以城市人口是不够維持人口不减的，祇有那些貧不能自立的，其生殖率才高達一·四三。敎育程度的差異亦如此。大學畢業的生殖率爲〇，五七，中學學業生爲〇·七七，小學畢業生爲一。一八。這種差異的生殖率，即便可以維持人口的均衡，但他可以大大影嚮人口的質，這種限制人口法，未免代價過高。　　差異生殖率對於人口的影嚮，可以智力爲例。即據極保守的估計，如霍登J．B．S．Haldaue在其「遺傳與政治」一書中的推測，則上層階級的生殖率仍如此低，下層階級的生殖率仍如次高，則每一代的平均智商要低百分之一到二，如此，則不用幾十代，全人類的絕對多數都要變成白癡了。或者有些人不相信智力全爲遺傳所決定。但即從環境論者的立塲，他也不得不承認將後一代交付與那些不能自立，無知無識，而又不負責任的父母們，後代的敎育很成問題。如果後天的敎養可以決定一個人的智力，差異生殖率的結果，與遣傳論者，仍毫無區別。這樣，人口政策便是現社會一個極重要的問題。如何保持人口的質與量到完滿的境地，是對民族關懷的任何人所須注意的一個問題。學林業話  張其昀　　省區問題　　省區改革問題，目前有贊成反對二派，業已展開辯論。作者爲主張縮小省區之一人，近再草一文，題爲」省區評議」，截於思想與時代第四十九期，（印刷中）對縮省理諭，重加硏討。略謂茍能詳審憲法之用意，則反對派懷疑各點，不難一一消釋。作者於張院長羣談話之用意，深表贊同，認爲建省確爲建國最大問題之一。正惟茲事體大，務宜慎重將事，以期博得大多數國民之同情。大公報記者謂無需在兵荒馬亂時列爲行憲第一大事，等到和平統一的時候再實行是不會太晚的。作者願更進一解，即使目前已經和平統一了，仍須經過各級民意機關詳加審議，完成立法手續，決不可以政府一紙命令，對省區遽作局部的改革，否則自亂步驟，結果必致徒滋糾紛。　　　民國二十年作者曾草「改革省區之基本原理」一文，（載於時事月報）其結論謂改革省區須經過三個時期。先爲準備期，次爲辯論期，又次爲實行期。目前改革省區之具體方案至少已有五種，（胡煥庸，黃國　，洪紱，勞幹，張其昀）內政部方與司所擬之方案，作者尙未見及。準備期暫可告一段落，現在應爲辯論期之開始。行憲之國民大會召開有日，政府應以此案提付大會討論，綜合各省代表之意見，先作原則上之賽查。如果縮省原則經大會通過，應由立法監察兩院組成聯席會議，審議具體方案，就社會與論，專家報告，與兩院同人見解，多方硏究，詳加考慮。再設小組審查會，就討論結果，製成假區域圖，附以說明書。然後由政府送交各省省議會覆議，省議會復徽詢各縣參議會之意見，往復商討，期於至當。再由下而上，由政府歸納民意，加以判斷，至此辯論期完畢。再待正式完成立法程序後，政府方可頒布新安區地圖，通令全國同時實現。建國大業，必須使人民心悅誠服，方爲合於民治正軌。　　新國防論　　空權興起以後對於舊日海權陸檢影嚮若何？此爲今日討論國防之先決問題。陸權指陸地活動之武備，以陸上要塞爲其根據地。海　指海上活動之武備，以軍港爲其根據地。海漢一帶可用兵艦載運　軍上陸，是謂海權與陸權之越地帶。空軍之　動非依於陸地，即依於海上，或二者兼而有之。空軍既不能脫離海陸軍而獨立，故空權不妨視爲海權與陸權之延伸與擴大。惟空軍流動性最大，海軍與陸軍可藉空軍之助，互相應援，極爲神速。再者利用空軍直接破壤敵人之經濟組織，飄忽無定，似又爲　軍突起之新戰略。目前之軍事形勢空權尙難獨自構成第三種武力，但又不易完全歸人於陸權海權系統之中。空軍最重大之影嚮在能匯合海陸，使海權與陸權明　之分野，不復存在。於是由舊日三兀之之防進而爲一元之新國防，最近世界各國政府改制，海軍部與陸軍部多已合併，成立總嚴三軍之國防部，即所以符合於新時代的要求。至於火箭與原子彈之發明，以及醞釀中之細菌戰爭，恐將使國防上地位與距離之因業，有歸於烏有之勢，這不特是戰略上的大革命，亦爲地理上空前的變化，世界前途眞難限量。[A&gt;本報週刊次序　　星期日　每週畫刋　　星期一　科學週刋　　星期二　學津週刋　　星期三　文學週刋　　星期四　出版界週刋　　星期五　新醫與新藥　　星期六　文史週刋</p>

<p>自由談舊京見聞  法會澤聞　　平津新聞之「巡行郵畫」，是為便利市民發信起見，每日按一定的時間，在一定的站口，停留二三小時，其停處選在離附近郵局約一里之譜，使人們確知某時到畫，就近送往車上，以省跋涉，原是法良意美。惟舊京與繁華華密茂之外埠大都市，情形不同。各郵局相距多不過二里有餘，中間且有「道帝郵簡」，可以發平信，習慣上並無不便。且巡行郵車旣有時間性，人民與其等待，且仍須跑路（車停處在大衛中心，離各巷住戶還有相當距離），故不甚注意，往往停留許久，無人問津。軍係奶洎白與油碧兩色，甚美觀，車中櫃箱座位，設備宛如小屋，車中人員，頗得閒靜之趣。　　倒是衝要路口添設之「郵亭」生意極佳。郵亭狀如香煙子，亦似電汽車票房，孤立亭亭，奶白頂璧，碧綠綫條，上端「郵亭」二字，亦白地綠字，潔凈而美麗。且饒詩情畫憲，令人有旗亭畫壁之思。　　平市美貨不少，但銷塲不皆暢旺，即如香煙可稱並嗜，大街小巷，煙閣煙攤，一家挨一家，無往而非五光十色，但在街頭過往的人衆，所購多是上海各公司出口，美煙只少數貴族美式摩登人物以為時髦，偶然光顧，故煙攤於「菲利普」，紅光等只備十分之一二，列於上層，聊以點繼，申煙則密字盤層層，其次為天津出品，價及品質均較低，小負販多喜購之。又如玻璃皮，眰璃絲各品，除面貨公司及新式商店外，普通市店及攤上絕少見之，偶然攤列梳子帶子之類，亦不見觀迎，當地婦女且以為易碎易破之小孩玩具。又如罐頭，的確「價廉物美」，然非民衆所習知，上面洋文，多數不識，更不能打開　　（舊京人買食品講安仁先　後買），而且品類太繁，食的用的（如擦鞋的油，殺蟲的藥）都是漂亮的鐵皮罐子，眞不知「胡蘆裏賣甚麼」，「老北京」們望望然去了。　　舊京雜合　（以民粗糧）已賣到八千一斤，美國的乾粉（豆賀），五磅重的一大罐，綫賣四萬元。而間者只說這罐子倒値二萬元，是不知內容何物也。其精裝火鷄（Turkey）每罐兩磅有餘，且係　去骨純肉，售價只五萬元，（菜市之生鷄每支有五六萬七八萬者，其肉量不過此罐四分之一），而無人過問。一次有友問我，Turkey何解？答以「火鷄」，則駭曰：「火鷄有毒，豈可食乎？」予曰此美國產之鷄，即是食口之鷄　，與番菜之Chicken品質相仿，決無他異，然而他終是懷疑，惟奶粉力酪Cheese，銷路特暢，價亦倍　猛刺，則因學界中敎職員學生主顧甚多。寂寞的調和  賓如　　這裏有一家小小的牛肉店，專賣牛肉點心的，像牛肉　，鍋貼，包子，牛百頁，牛肉湯之類，都很可口，而且價廉。　　大約小店都是如此的罷，從老闖到伙計，是一家人，一切情形都很融洽，使得化錢來吃的客人坐著也舒服，我時常在此消磨我的時間。　　還有那些同座客，車夫，小工，負販，都是髒得可以，但從他們身邊措出的大疊鈔票看來，除了吃飽了自己，一定能養活其他的人，這也同樣是令人安心的事。　　有時還能看見一個喝飽了酒再來喝酒的外國人，當他揮差司的克搖搖幌幌地跨進門時，老闖必定打起上海白問他：　　「哈羅，哈羅，為啥長遠勿來？」　　外國人總是笑著點頭說：　　「嘸不鈔票，嘸不鈔票，阿拉嘸不鈔票就勿來。」　　是道地的外國上海話，然後就摸出一張五千元的法幣，不用吩咐，掌柜的便接著呌去打了一杯五茄皮。外國人分了三口，把它喝光了，用手背抹抹嘴，便又搖搖著走了。也總是走到門口時必定回頭招招手，又說了一聲「明早會」。他只把自己的印象留給旁人，並沒有想到旁邊有什麼人。　　這小店也有收音機，因為老　愛聽平劇，所以時常收的是平劇的唱片或轉播。有一晚老　問我：　　「你老也愛聽戲嗎？」　　這時收音機正剛正播放著言菊月的聲音，凄涼，　　，正是我認為最好的，於是我就告訴他：我也愛聽，但我不愛聽馬連良或梅蘭芳的，我要聽高慶奎，我要聽金少山，尤其喜歡的是言菊朋。　　老　聽了我的話，不禁感嘆著說道：「啊！你老正是讀書人，言老　也是秀才出身，怪不得要偏愛他了，哈哈！」　　其實我之所以獨愛言菊朋，倒不是因為他的讀書出身，不過總覺他的聲音比任何人用得好，每一個字都扣得那麼緊（決不單是咬得準），無形中成為一個個有力的似地東西，深深地打著人的心，和這個凄涼，寂寞而多姿的人間，十分調和。判斷力  葛春良　　　律士是城中最聰明，最富有智慧的人，這是誰都承認，毫無疑問的。有一天，羣衆中的一個青年問他：「裘律士」，他说，「究竟你怎麼竟會這樣的聰明，什麼使你知道得這樣的多呀？」　　「優良凖確的判斷力。」裘律士有恃無恐地說：「我可以說，那一定是為了我的優良凖確的判斷力呀！」　　「那麼，你的優良凖確的判斷力是從那裏來的呢？」　　「那是我從經騐中得來的。」　　「那麼，你的經騐從那裏來的呢？」　　「那是從我的錯誤的判斷中得來的呀！」說「鑽」  季庸　　張端義的貴耳集是一部有意思的書，卷不記太師椅一條云：　　「今之校（按即交）椅，古之胡床也，自來只有材栳樣，宰執侍從皆用之，因秦師垣（即繪）在國忌所信仰片時，墜巾，京尹吳淵奉承時相，出意撰製荷葉　首四十柄，　赴國忌所，遺匠者頃刻添上，凡宰執侍從皆有之，遂號太師樣。」　　一椅之微，而有如此無恥事實，眞是想不到。秦相國當日之威勢要已可知，然拍馬者亦尙明白道理，荷　葉託首作了四十只，宰執皆有之。我鄕有紳士宴縣長，特設一席，就坐時大呼：「上座是給縣長預備的！」諸紳雖不敢較，然怏怏也，此之謂鑽亦有道。趙師　對韓侂胄的「　鳴狗吠」，就太那個了，不但自己丟人，後人看了也十分不舒服。故吳公淵是頗可瓣香的。　　一等有一等之鑽，要以「先獲我心」為主。秦檜怎麼得志的？他的法寶是「和」，他看中康王沒有再打下去的意思——　欽宗眞的迎回來，康王的皇帝還怎麼作！所以岳飛是傻瓜——就冒天下之大不韙替皇帝挨道份兒駡，後人從知秦氏之險惡，而不知高宗之更險更惡，貴耳集卷中一則云：　　「秦檜一日膽高廟天顏不悅，葵云，何事上勞聖　慮？答云：郊祁匹帛闕五百萬支。曰：臣當為陛　下任此事。（宋制，郊禮畢，必賞賣大臣，所費不貲。）忽一日奏云：乞禁中賜臣酒四金壺。將某日宣賜，秦約張韓二將（當是張灘，韓世忠）來議事，自朝至午未間，未得謁入，但見中使宣賜御酒來，心愈惑，且驚，移是，秦與張緯道，並不發一語，忽云：御前賜酒，同飲一盃，張韓奉扈，戰慄不敢飲。秦先取履險如夷飲。秦先取酒飲一勺，少定，緩云：主上欲與二將各假一千萬錢，以奉郊禮，祭畢後撥賜。張法紀謹奉令，奏知高廟，得旨，只假五百緡。」　　看了張韓必得那副神氣，實覺不堪。如果那個是毒藥，怕又管甚麼？然亦正是說明秦之不好惹也。軍閥時代，以此術綁票者甚多，當然亦有因　　這種方法而竊得時位者，會之的聰明，　深可愛悅耳。讀書旣多，明理更深，往往成為　之奴隸，一毫不會轉灣，如我　之者毡坐破，殆是孟子所云「盡信書則不如無　」者。唯孟子主張以意逆志，是逆古人，如今則須先意承志為略異而已。還有一則極幽默的文字，作為此小文的結尾：「世之巧宦者，皆調之鑽班，班固云，商鞅挾三術以鑽孝公。嘉定間，士大夫有一戲論於從政云：將仕皆得改官，獨顏子孔門四科之首，不得改官，夫子曰：回也不改。顏子鑽錯了，鑽之張堅，如何改官！」輸血  介丁　　成都華西大學醫科學生為募集學校基金，自動輸血義賣，所鎖得金錢全部充學校基金，並規定每人至少輸血二百GG。（申報）　　抗戰時，學生越過千山萬水，吃盡辛苦，啃菜根吃「八寶飯」，睡草窩，呼吸桐油煙煤，還要把血　臭蟲蚊于跳蚤白　，學生們的健康早喪失了。瘧疾，肺病貧血，不知吞噬了多少學生的青春。　　抗戰勝利，復員奔波且不管，吃苦仍舊依然，時局仍不平靜，看看面黃肌瘦的學生，本來在需要血。偏偏華西大學的學生還有遙股子傻勁，願把幾年耗減下來的寶貴的血換取學校基金，眞有貼敎人胆寒！　　實在，歷年來的敎育經費眞太東西眞太苛了。敎師嚷着吃不飽，學生根本見不到圖書設備，看了上海的學校還像個樣子（「學店」例外），內地的學校可信慘，連課桌椅都很多不全的，敎室受風吹雨打，像凉亭一樣，更不要談其他設備。小學中學如此，大學也如此。學校裏　唸書，小學識幾個字，中學多認幾個，大學再多認幾個，照課本讀讀唸唸，和從前的私塾沒有兩樣；人家在硏究原子撃破襪應用雷達了，我們的學生許多連一架天平一根試管都沒有見過。　　當然學生是着車知識的，上學校就是要求實在的知識啊，自然科學却必需目到手到，背書背出了也沒有用。非增加設備不可！可是，錢呢？政府沒有撥，捐募看冷臉還要碰壁。沒有辦法，只有喻血，拿血來換智識！　　本來，學生的血也不太貴重，貧血已不算什麼「病」，倒不像腦滿腸肥的大腹買貪官汚吏天天吃魚吃肉，也就是吃老百姓和學生的血，還只嫌血少，更得　補血汁，人造自來血之類。這些血才是又油又膩的滋補品，學生血裏也許大都含着細菌。　　　學生拿血換智識除只有這個世界裏　才有，身體健康不斷被戕害，出學校就帶着智識進墳墓。　　我們究竟還要不要文化？要不要後代？花草誌(下)  夢農　　斷腸草　　據說廣東的深山大澤之中，有一種　草，開小花，粉黃百兩種，食之就會讓人斷腸而死，所以古人稱之為斷腸草。　　別以為斷腸草是無用的東西。它的用場多的很。凡是求生不得求死無方的失意人等，要自殺的話，就往往千方百計地去迫奪斷腸草，正像都市中的人抓到來沙爾藥水便可以服毒自盡，一樣地方便。還有些企圖報「仇」　「怨」的人們，或是些欺詐不遂的人民，便也可往往置備了斷腸草，塞進對方的口腔內，使對方七竅出血而死。因此從前死於斷腸草的人，絕不比現在死魚来沙爾藥水的人　少。　　於是有悲天憫人者出來，或以仁人君子的姿態，或以慈善家的臉孔，與世人相見。不知是哪一位父母官，或許是一位地方紳士，他看到自殺者和殺人犯實在禍根，只要禍根一除，則殺機全絕，天下也就太平無事了。接着，出佈告，發傳單，說：「凡拨草以　者，每　銀若干。」至於佈告或傳單後面，照例是拖着一條「儲款以待，決不食言」之類的尾巴。　　都從事拨草生活，連賣荣人也不高興種　或販　，一心一意地以拔草為職業了。肩上挑的，筐中盛的，手中拿的，到處都是斷腸草。　　「幾時拔得盡？」這問題終於發生了。拔草的人是多的，然而奇怪的是草愈拔愈多，大抵是，深山在，大泽在，这种草是不可能拔盡的。是這樣的土，產生了這樣的斷腸草，這是一件明明白白的事實。　　拔草的命令只得取消，游民的失業如故，尋死路的人也何嘗絕跡與人世？種　的也照樣回去園地。佔了一時便宜的，還不是只有那一批所謂的仁人君子或地方　紳士之類，在博得了一度「佳　」之後，完結了。　　「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生！」我微吟着，我感嘆着。送禮雜感  王槐德　　是聖誕節了，又到了送禮的時候。人生於世，放佛送禮這一節目是永遠的不免不了的。親友們結婚，要送禮；做壽，要送禮；添了孩子，要送禮；死了人，也要送禮。過年過節，更不消說，不送禮不行。俗話說：親戚藍去藍來，鄰居碗去婉來、倘要做到好親戚熟鄰居，勢必要以送禮始。　　紅樓夢裏的賈芸要鳳姐派種花木的事給他，不惜光向人借了錢，買些冰片　香作為禮物，這正是他聰明的地方。我們相求別人幫忙，最好的辦法是送禮，所謂「動之以利」，實在是百戰百勝的策略，因為人家既收了你的東西，總不好意思不替你出點力了。　　送禮，如果是為了維持交情，原也未可厚非，但問題就在於自己沒錢，不想送，而人情世故偏偏避　你非送不可。　　豈不聞世有「送禮循環法」嗎？自己送給人的禮物，會照樣原封不動的由人恭恭敬敬的送還，眞呌人帝笑皆非！可見大家送去送來，都是敷衍手段，實在多此一舉。在　關服務的人更　，主要主管當局有了一點小事，說不定就有他的親戚發起送禮，也不是先微求衆人同意，由他們　派沒人應送多少，向會計課領了去，等到說　的時候在扣除。至於亂發帖子飲錢的「打秋風」，尤其可恨可惡，送禮者簡直如同受到「付款通知」一樣了。　　鳴呼！如此送禮，怎不教人大喊「鳴呼」呢！屠格涅夫的悲哀  劉騰讓　　大概在七十年前，巴黎有一個奇異的組織，名叫「失敗作家吃飯團」，進吃飯團是由都德左拉一批人組織起來的。有一天在吃飯團的門外突然跨進了以為　顏白髮的老人，左拉立刻非常嚴肅的問：「你來幹什麼？」　　「我來參加吃飯團的，」老人說。　　「你有什麼資格參加我們吃飯團？」左拉毫不客氣的問。「我是屠格涅夫，我的作品在俄國是夠失敗的！」老人尷尬的一聳肩。　　「啊！」左拉立刻飛奔過去緊拉了他的手，高聲說：「我們萬分的歡迎你，的確你是夠失敗的，先生。」　　這雖然是一個笑話，但是我們可以看到屠格涅夫一生就身　藝術的慘　結果。藝術家的偉大與光榮的收　也許就是這慘淡的結果吧！一直到今天，屠格涅夫也并没有為大衆所歡迎，他所贏得的也只有少數中的極少數讀者而已。　　雖然托爾斯泰會大聲疾呼的把莎士比亞放到第三流的作家去，而推崇與自己意見最不相合的屠格涅夫為第一流夠格的藝術家，然而可惜的很，他簡直不能在自己的國土裏立腳，最後的「烟」和「處女地」，更和俄國偏見的人們劉了永不逾越的鴻溝。在屠格涅夫的六本代表小說裏，我們可以窺出他的那偉大藝術手法以及那全人類的悲哀，好像撥動了人類淒然的琴弦，使我們顫動着共鳴着！　　人生大概就不會逃出悲劇的吧？聰明的人扮着悲劇的悲劇，愚魯的人扮着喜劇的悲劇。我以為沒有一個比平庸到不能認識自己的悲哀更悲哀的事了。在屠格涅夫的作品裏，他給我們帶來了最高尚的悲曲，「悲劇的悲劇」。他使我們洞悉了整個人生：失敗，失敗，一起都失敗了！這警鐘敲醒了後來的人們，但是他自己也並沒逃出這失敗的遭遇！消遙花  陳慎言　　第五章　飛來橫禍　（二二）　　渚齋急往四下一看，這時車子正經過北海園後門，突見前面有一女子，由一人家，飛奔出去，後面跟了一大群人呼喊追逐。前面飛跑那女子，被追得無路可走，越下土坡，直奔什刹海岸旁走去。渚齋在月光之下，看得親切，見許多人追逐一個女子，不由悲憤填胸，由車上一躍而下，追到土坡下，眼看前面女子，奔到岸邊，快要從身投水，喊了一聲：「使不得！」一從已到她身旁，擱腰一把將他抱住。渚齋在月光一看，吃了一驚，所抱不是別人，乃是綺紈！看她一頭亂髮，血流满面，身上身上祗穿一件薄薄短袖夾袍，雙臂露在外面，也全是血！這一下，可把渚齋嚇呆了。綺紈在去死一髮之間，忽見渚齋來救，驚恐槐恨，交併心頭，哇了一聲，哭了。她身子極力掙扎，連喊：「放我走，放我走，沒臉見人。」這時後面追逐的人，也越土坡而下，趕到岸前。為首的是一個三十多歲的女太太，手裏倒拿了一根雞毛　帶，兇神惡煞似的，搶了過來，一見綺紈伏在渚齋手臂上，要狠狠一撣向綺紈臉上打下。渚齋眼明手快，撣柄還沒大到綺紈臉上，一手早把他接住，向懷裏一帶，那跟雞毛撣帶，早到渚齋手裏，向地上一擲，隨渚齋向那女太太　旁一堆，她連倒退幾步，跌在泥污裏面。後面跟來那一群人，見太太被推到，齊聲發喊道：「別動手，這是林局長太太！」渚齋一聽林局長太太，心裏早已明白幾分，正要向她發話，這時土坡上有飛奔下一人，搶到渚齋跟前，瞭眼喝問到：「你是誰？」渚齋一看來的人耳尖，鼻扁，凹眼睛，厚嘴唇，稀疏幾根鼠鬚，　不可言，料定就是小王嫣所說的那位林局長，立時把胸部一挺，大聲說道：「你問我嗎？我是綺紈的哥哥，你們仗勢欺人，我和你打官司去！」說時，伸手過去，便要抓他，林福田一聽是綺紈的哥哥，早抽了一口冷氣，一聽不　，抹磚頭便逃。一眼看見太太躺在泥污裏面，還在破口大罵，喝令下人快把太太扶回去。林太太見　田不打綺紈，反要呌她回去，便在泥堆裏面嚎啕大哭，滿　　滾，沾了滿身泥土，好似泥鰍一般，不肯起來，蔡不起來眾人，一齊下手，把她扶住，連拉帶抬了去。渚齋看了又好氣又好笑，　問綺紈為了何事，綺紈仍是哭泣，一面掙扎身子，一面哭喊：「放開我，放我去！我沒臉見人」社會服務讀者熱烈響應「寒衣運動」　　昨天上午，有一位讀者，氣急冲冲的趕到本館來，說是要響應本局發起的「寒衣運動」，捐一點兒錢給窮苦的同胞，說明製下了手指上的金戒子，交給我們，當然對於黃金的捐贈，我們是不能貿然收受的，但我們已經被這種天眞而誠摯的動作感動得流下淚來！當天下午這位讀者重復來館，帶來了二百萬元的捐款，——這就是那金戒子的代價。——你這位讀者的熱誠和慷慨，我們未曾前見。現在不知道用甚麼話來稱頌這件事情，我們只希望社會上無數的熱心人們，都能效法這位讀者多多的捐一些錢或寒衣，使無數輾轉在飢寒綫上的難胞，早日得到溫暖的安慰。　　這位讀者的姓名呌任寶勝，中年人，穿藍布長衫，並不像很有錢，但是他具有偉大的同情的，値得我們稱頌與摹仿。　　昨天為陳南陔先生捐贈寒衣帽鞋共廿六件，沈如寬先生捐寒衣六件，葉先生捐十件，邵大椿鞋襪短衫共四十一件。（現金捐款明日擴登）　　據天文台報告：另一寒流，又將侵襲上海，不知道又有多少難胞，要被這殘酷的寒浪所吞噬，親愛的讀者，趕快趁早捐助罷！大學生求職　願聘者希逕函接洽　　願任家　敎師者：　交通大學彭本蘇（上院三二四室），徐乾清（新中院一一四室），寗奇生（中院三〇九室），敬克敏（四八號信箱），劉體乾（　　西齋二三四室），邢師青（新舍一〇九號），黃世羣（上院三三〇室）。　同濟大學吳凌震，寶憲章（新力齊二〇八号）。　幼稚師範張鴻斌（愚　路幼專）。　　願大學范思翔（中院三〇三室）。　復旦大學謝南宗（德莊兩樓一一六號）。</p>

<h3>National Government Circular Orders Celebration of Constitution Implementation; National Flags to be Displayed Throughout the Country Starting the Day After Tomorrow; Legislative Yuan Passes Procedures for Ending Political Tutelage</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] December 25th of this year marks the date of the commencement of the Constitution of the Republic of China. The National Government has circulated a telegram to all units, schools, and organizations across the country, instructing them to display the national flag on that day to commemorate the occasion. Furthermore, the Committee for Promoting Constitutional Implementation believes that the 25th, being the anniversary of the completion of the Constitution and the date of implementation of the Constitution as resolved by the National Assembly, should be promoted more vigorously for commemoration. In the capital, the committee will convene a celebration and commemoration meeting on that day, inviting members in Nanjing to attend. Major cinemas will screen newsreels related to the National Assembly and elections, and Nanjing artists will be mobilized to add celebratory performances to their acts on that day. Newspapers will publish articles related to constitutionalism. Provincial and municipal governments will be instructed by the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan to mobilize celebrations.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The 343rd regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 22nd, both morning and afternoon, presided over by concurrently President Sun. Important cases passed in the morning included: Procedures Law for Ending Political Tutelage, Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the State During the Suppression of Rebellion, Regulations for Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans of the Banking Industry, and the University Law. (Items 1 and 2 in full are printed in the lower left corner, items 3 and 4 in full are printed on the second page.)</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The Legislative Yuan continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd and passed important cases including: the Law on Specialized Schools, the Protocol on Amending Three Articles of the International Civil Aviation Convention, the Agreement on the Use of Funds as Stipulated in Article 6, Section B, Paragraph 1 of the Agreement on the Sale of Surplus Wartime Property Between China and the United States, Seven International Loan Agreements and Contracts including the Agreement Between China and the United States Regarding the Handling of Unused Portions of Wartime Lend-Lease Materials, the Commercial Accounting Law, Amendments to the Articles of the Provincial Bank Regulations, and the Regulations on the Organization of the National Government's Committee for the Punishment of Political Affairs Officials. Furthermore, the Regulations on the Management of Prepared Medicines do not need to complete the legislative process, and the Civil Servant Insurance Law is postponed for discussion.</p>
<h3>Amendments to the Organization Law of the Five Yuan; Legislative Yuan to Hold Extraordinary Session Today for Deliberation; Zhang Qun to Visit the Yuan to Explain Salary Adjustment Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The Legislative Yuan has scheduled an extraordinary session for the 23rd to discuss important cases such as the Amendment to the Organization Law of the Five Yuan and the Civil Servant Salary Adjustment Plan. In addition to concurrently President Sun presiding in person, the Vice President of the Control Yuan will attend to explain the Organization Law of the Control Yuan. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan will also be invited to visit the Yuan at around 11:00 AM to explain matters related to adjusting civil servant salaries. It is unprecedented for the heads of three Yuan to attend on the same day, and the atmosphere at the meeting is expected to be extremely lively. Furthermore, concurrently President Sun instructed during the meeting on the 22nd that the revision of the Organization Law of the Five Yuan and other important laws must be completed quickly to complete the legislative process, as the 25th marks the beginning of constitutional governance. In addition to holding a general meeting on the morning of the 23rd, another meeting must be held before the end of the year. In January, due to the need for most members to return to their original constituencies to campaign, the session will be adjourned several times. The national general budget for the first half of next year will only be discussed after the session resumes.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The issue of civil servant salary adjustments was raised again at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd. Liu Guanshun proposed temporarily that Liu Zhiping, who participated in the Salary Adjustment Committee, report on the progress of the meeting. Mr. Liu stood up and reported that the committee had held six meetings, and the heads of the five Yuan unanimously agreed with the principles proposed by the Legislative Yuan. The technical aspects of the salary adjustment had been discussed in detail and concrete decisions had been made. Premier Zhang had expressed his support for the Yuan's proposal when he returned from the north. However, since the proposal was put forward, three months had passed, and the need to adjust civil servant salaries was urgent. He did not know whether Premier Zhang was aware of the suffering of civil and military personnel. If he was aware, why had he not sought a solution earlier? Whether Premier Zhang's promise that day could be fulfilled, all these questions needed to be explained by Premier Zhang. He suggested inviting Premier Zhang to the Yuan to explain. Furthermore, the civil servant salary adjustment matter will be discussed at the State Council meeting on the 26th. If the decisions made are unsatisfactory, we will make further representations. After Mr. Liu's report, the meeting agreed that the matter was important and decided to invite Premier Zhang to the Yuan to explain at the extraordinary meeting on the morning of the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Regular Meeting Passes Loan Agreements Between China and the United States, Including Seven Items Such as Purchase of Equipment and Ship Leases</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The 343rd regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan passed several diplomatic cases on the 22nd, among which the important ones include: The Agreement Between China and the United States Regarding the Handling of Unused Portions of Wartime Lend-Lease Materials.

White, the U.S. Foreign Property Disposal Officer, in Shanghai on August 30th of last year, the rest were signed by Wang Shoujing, Director of the Materials Supply Office of the Materials Supply Committee of our Executive Yuan in the United States, with Lonnie, Deputy Chairman of the U.S. Foreign Property Disposal Committee, and Martin, General Manager, and Sherwood, Secretary of the U.S. Export-Import Bank in Washington, between June and August of last year under Song's direction. The final seventh amended contract was also signed by Wang on April 17th of this year to extend the disbursement deadline for the fifth generator loan by six months to the end of June next year. Among the first six agreements and contracts, the total value of the materials included in the first item is US$58.9 million, which will be repaid in 30 years starting from July 1st of this year. The total value of the materials included in the second item reaches US$584 million, part of which has been declared as surplus materials. China should allocate US$55 million to accept these materials.

<h3>Clearing of Pre-War Deposits and Loans; Balancing the Interests of Banks and Depositors; Liu Tong Explains the Review Process of the Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The Regulations on Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans of the Banking Industry have been debated and approved on the 20th. It is argued that this plan is not very good, but it is difficult to find a better solution. The reasons are as follows: 1. The outbreak of the war was unpredictable and cannot be attributed to any one party, so there is no way to determine who should bear the responsibility. 2. Both parties suffered losses during the war, so both parties should be taken into account. 3. As far as the current situation is concerned, if favoring depositors, the banking industry cannot afford it, and the result will inevitably be bankruptcy. If ignoring the interests of depositors, and profits soar after the war, the banking industry enjoying excessive benefits is also unreasonable. These regulations take both parties into account and are not far from fair. 4. The amount of money that the banking industry has not yet repaid is known to be 4 billion, and there are still many unknowns. With such a huge amount of money and loans from the banking industry, if not resolved early, disputes will inevitably arise, which is detrimental to both parties. 5. The application of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery by the court varies from place to place, which is not a unified method, and only increases disputes and is not a solution. 6. The currency was quite stable before the declaration of war. Since then, various situations have changed, and the currency value has tended to fall. Taking the pre-war period as the standard is not without basis. 7. Current accounts and fixed deposits are different, because current accounts can be withdrawn at any time, while fixed deposits cannot be withdrawn. Separating the interest of the two is also reasonable.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Three Legislators; First Time Attending Yuan Meeting</h3>

<h3>Kuomintang Central Commemorative Week; Qin Dechun Reports on Military Affairs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Kuomintang Central Commemorative Week was held this morning at the Central Party Headquarters. After Committee Member Dai Chuanxian led the ceremony, Acting Minister of National Defense Qin Dechun gave a military report. Mr. Qin first described the recent situation of suppressing bandits, saying that the communist bandits in the Northeast had launched the seventh offensive with more than 200,000 people, attacking Kaiyuan, Liaoning, and western Liaoning in three directions. Their attempt was to cut off the northern route and isolate Shenyang, but due to our adequate preparations, their failure will be no different from past offensives. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's bandits in the Dabie Mountains have established a base, threatening Wuhan and destroying the attempt to disrupt traffic, which has also been eliminated by the encirclement of our large army. The bandits have now dispersed. The remaining bandits in Hubei and Henan are also being intercepted and thoroughly eliminated by the National Army. Mr. Qin also reported on the resettlement of demobilized officers. More than 280,000 demobilized officers at the general, colonel, and lieutenant levels have been respectively retained, transferred, or retired, and the procedures have been completed. Secondly, the salaries of military personnel have been adjusted according to the ratio of salaries for civil and military personnel since August, and the lives of military personnel have been greatly improved compared to before.</p>

After negotiations among all parties, in addition to Yanbei, the Wutai area, which is currently controlled by the communist bandits, was also assigned to the Suppression Headquarters, because Wutai and western Hebei are a single area militarily.</p>

<h3>U.S. Drafts Aid to China Plan; Relevant Departments Are Reviewing It Seriously</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] State Department personnel are carefully reviewing a draft plan for aid to China that has already been drawn up. As of today, the review has commenced by relevant government departments (including the Budget Bureau, etc.). The aid to China plan will be included in President Truman's message on January 6th. Due to criticism from the Republican Party and the dispute over the amount of foreign aid, it is expected that President Truman or Secretary of State Marshall will issue a separate statement on China policy.</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun Discusses U.S. Aid to China; Military and Economic Aid Should Be Given Equal Emphasis</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun stated that unless both military and economic assistance to China are given equal emphasis, neither form of assistance can truly take effect. It is said that the surplus military supplies to aid the National Government's army are of limited value unless the soldiers' salaries can be raised and morale can be boosted. With insufficient equipment, the government troops are fighting with the communist army. The communist army will continue to disrupt traffic and disrupt the national economy. During this period, single economic assistance is mostly irrelevant. Yu also said that if huge military expenditures continue to be paid, the hope of stabilizing the currency in the first step is very slim. What we do to ease the currency flood is to justify production, increase taxes, reduce expenditures, and increase domestic income. In fact, reforming the currency system is certainly necessary, but if the root cause of the currency flood cannot be eliminated, issuing a new currency system or changing the value of the current currency will make the problem more complicated and useless.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Civilian-Operated Goods at Compensatory Prices; Applications Can Be Issued Immediately; Gu Baochang Claims Compensation Materials Can Be Used</h3>
<p>[News Report] Yesterday, a reporter inquired about the issue of evaluating and selling Japanese compensation materials for civilian use to Gu Baochang, Director of the Industry Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who came to Shanghai on official business. He said that the price of the compensation materials sold to civilian factories will be determined by the Valuation Committee. This committee is actively being organized and will be formally established soon. This committee includes nine members, including three from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, two from the Ministry of Finance, two representatives from national industrial groups, and two representatives from national commercial groups. Invitations will be sent out soon. The principle of installment payments has already been determined. The detailed methods and the signing of contracts are yet to be supplemented in the future. The application forms for allocating compensation materials have already been drafted and are currently being printed in large quantities. They will be distributed to municipal governments and industrial and commercial guidance offices in various places in the near future, and factories can apply according to certain procedures. Since the first batch of compensation materials is working machines, the application method is for each factory to apply individually. The application method may change when the entire equipment is shipped. Gu strongly denied the point that most of the external compensation materials are unusable old items, and pointed out that this is a theory with ulterior motives. Its purpose is nothing more than to obtain compensation materials for free. Gu said: "As far as I know, only one-third of the first batch of materials are lacking parts. Our country does not intend to accept them. In the future, the value of this part can still be deducted from the total compensation value after calculation. It does not mean that after winning the lottery, you will be forced to accept it. The purpose of the government's priced sale of compensation materials is to increase the national treasury. If it wants to obtain it for free, the government can allocate it to the Ministry of Communications and the Resources Committee, and there is no need to target civilian factories." Regarding the request of 24 shipyards in this city to contract for the Japanese Kawashima Shipyard, Gu believes that if the factory's equipment is transported to China, it can be contracted by private shipyards, but at present, the method of obtaining compensation materials has been changed to lottery, so there is no way to be sure in advance.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Dancing Girls Request Postponement of Dance Ban Again</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd] Regarding the issue of banning dancing in Guangzhou City, the city government previously extended the deadline to the end of this month as the prohibition period.  As the deadline approaches, dancing girls have been continuously holding meetings, appealing for a delay in the ban and petitioning the city government to extend it to the end of September next year, following the example of other cities.  Their reasoning is that the training period for dancing girls is too short, making it impossible for them to change professions.</p>

<p>Eastern European Countries Plan to Form a Strong Bloc to Rival the Marshall Plan; Berlin to Become the Focal Point of Political Struggle</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] Today it was learned that Eastern European countries within the Soviet sphere of influence are currently forming a strong bloc, striving for Communist domination of Europe and preventing Western countries from gaining leadership. This can be seen in the talks of foreign ministers, ambassadors, and other important figures of Eastern and Western European countries. They predict the development of the situation next spring as follows: Given the de facto state of division in Germany, Eastern and Western European countries may re-adjust their foreign policies to promote various new regional defense alliances, not only to resist Germany's re-emergence of aggression, but also to resist any future aggression. In the Balkans, the Soviet satellite states will intensify the integration of their political and economic life with the countries of the Danube Basin, including Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, Romania, and Hungary. Mutual assistance and friendship treaties are about to be signed, further abolishing trade and tariff barriers, and coordinating national reconstruction plans, ultimately aiming to establish a large federation. According to a European foreign minister, after communist countries consolidate their political and economic ties, they can unite 80 to 90 million people. At that time, a new country will emerge in Europe, and under the leadership of the Soviet Union, a plan for the reconstruction of Eastern Europe will be drafted to undermine the Marshall Plan and strive for political advantage. Another British official said that the Danube may become a river close to the West, while the world's richest triangle between the Adriatic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Baltic Sea will be integrated with the Soviet Union. The breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers' Conference may trigger a political battle for Berlin. The Soviet Union will follow the West German movement and advocate the establishment of a German central government based in Berlin, spiritually appealing to the German people to organize groups to rival the Frankfurt government. The battlefield for the governance war between the Eastern and Western sides of Europe lies in Greece. The Soviet Union's next action seems to be the establishment of a "Free Greek Government" in the mountainous areas of the northern border province, led by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Developments in the Middle East Situation Worry Turkey</p>
<p>[United Press, Istanbul, 21st] The Turkish government is visibly anxious about the political developments on both the northern and southern borders of the country. Yugoslavia has been negotiating with Poland and Hungary to conclude a 20-year mutual assistance treaty. The official response has not been stated, but it is being closely watched. The same is true for the conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine. Since Turkey voted in favor of the partition of the Holy Land at the United Nations General Assembly, it has consistently adopted a policy of non-intervention; applications from journalists to go and cover the news have also been rejected. Some observers believe that Turkey's major concern about the Middle East crisis is that this matter may allow the Soviet Union to use the excuse of maintaining order to send troops to Palestine, causing Soviet troops to approach Turkey's borders from both the north and south.</p>
<p>Important Status of Frankfurt, the Future Capital of West Germany</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 22nd] This somber city in Hesse has stepped onto the world stage due to the breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and may become the future capital of West Germany. At first glance, this seems to be a misunderstanding, as Frankfurt only has the coldness of an ordinary industrial city. Even though it did not suffer severe bombing during the war, it has neither the shady avenues of Washington, D.C., nor the charm of Paris, the glory of Rome, or the tradition of London. However, there are various advantages. Frankfurt is centrally located among the major cities of West Germany, close to the intersection of the US, British, and French occupation zones. The population of the three zones is about 46 million. Although it has been through war, there are still many houses. The US military headquarters and the Anglo-American Joint Economic Council are both located here, and it is a hub for air and rail transportation. A total of 360 trains enter and exit daily, and it is possible to reach Paris, Brussels, Copenhagen, Vienna, and Berlin overnight. In addition, Frankfurt has a long history and deserves to be a symbol of the future West Germany, it is not just luck.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Controls North Korea, Cannons Pointed at the US-Occupied Zone, Impressions of a British Journalist's Visit</p>
<p>[United Press, Seattle, 22nd] After arriving here by plane from Tokyo, Gordon Curnane, a well-known reporter from 20 British newspapers, stated that the Soviet Union has strategically defeated the United States in Korea and that internal strife will occur in Korea in March next year. The failure of the US military to enter northern Korea to expel the Soviet troops was a mistake. For the future threat of the Communist Party, there is almost no other way but to withdraw. Mr. Curnane inspected the demarcation line between the north and south zones of the 38th parallel last Wednesday and witnessed Soviet cannons aiming at the US side. After a short stay in Seattle, Mr. Curnane will fly to New York and arrive in London on Tuesday to spend Christmas.</p>

<p>Tojo Exonerates the Japanese Emperor, Declares that the Pacific War is Not Related to the Emperor, and Claims to be a Meritorious Anti-Communist in the East</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] Former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo testified in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East today, not proving his innocence but denying that he should be held responsible for deciding to declare war and all actions after the declaration of war. However, he did not shirk responsibility for the treatment of Allied prisoners of war during the construction of the Burma Railway. Tojo accused the Allied countries of absolutely instigating the war and forcing the United States to participate in the European conflict. He also said: "The Emperor is completely innocent of the declaration of war. The Emperor has a spirit of love for peace. The decision to go to war in December 1941 was made by the Cabinet ministers and the Supreme Command Headquarters and has absolutely nothing to do with the Emperor." He also explained that Japan's opposition to communism was to save East Asia from the threat of Bolshevism. He also said that the situation two years after the end of World War II shows how important the anti-communist barrier is to world peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Foreign Minister Togo Shigenori, who was in office during the Pearl Harbor period, admitted in military court today that he and Tojo reported to the Emperor on the response to President Roosevelt's message on December 7, 1941, without consulting with elder statesman Kido, but he loudly denied that Japan was merely a "puppet rubber stamp."</p>
<p>US Economy Faces Crisis, Truman's Economic Advisory Committee Submits Report, Advocates Formulating a High Production Plan</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The second annual report submitted to President Truman by the Economic Advisory Committee of the President was released today, stating that if the United States wants to avoid the cycle of prosperity and depression and achieve lasting and stable balance, it must suppress the prices of industrial products, accept smaller profits, and balance the equality of wages and income distribution.</p>
<p>Rather than creating short-term prosperity through unbalanced expansion and excessive investment, it is better to make continuous and fully balanced use of the nation's productive resources. Short-term prosperity will inevitably be followed by wasteful periods of unemployment, factory closures, and liquidations. The report calls on the government and Congress to formulate a concrete plan for the highest degree of production that is visible and perceptible to the people. It also said that intensifying production cannot solve the problem of how to maintain the minimum production level alone, but only brings the country face-to-face with the question of what adjustments should be made to prices, wages, and property values ​​to create a lasting and stable internal balance. The report stressed that for the sake of establishing reasonable profits on a universal scale, the prices and profits of many industrial products must be suppressed, and the imbalances of the wage structure must be adjusted. The completion of these goals is the most sublime test of the American business community. If economic stability is to be achieved within the private enterprise system, management must accept more practical responsibilities when drafting investment and operating plans. The report concludes that facing the economic problems we face today, such as inflation, high living costs, and other retrogressive threats, our conclusion is that any monopolistic control over any part of the American productive capacity must be terminated.</p>
<p>The Potential of Japanese Underground Organizations Should Not Be Ignored</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The so-called problem of underground government continues to occupy a place in Japanese newspapers and magazines. "Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun" claims that the recent large-scale carjacking incidents in various places were all done by retired soldiers, because each action was meticulously planned and implemented in a very systematic way, indicating the existence of an underground retired soldiers' organization. It is said that these retired soldiers are organized into groups according to their military academy years and secretly store military weapons for future use. They initially intended to avenge the shame of defeat, but later realized the changing social situation. Now, compelled by the economic crisis and severe inflation, they have formed strong gangs or contacted frustrated politicians. In other words, the enemy of the Allied forces during the war has now become an opponent of the democratic government. The newspaper also said that although underground governments do not harm national welfare during the Allied occupation, their potential impact should not be ignored.</p>

<p>Shanghai Becomes a Center for Opium Trafficking and Manufacturing, There Are Still 30,000 to 50,000 Secret Drug Users in the City, Military and Police Join Forces to Form a Detective Network and Step Up Checks on Land, Sea and Air</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Reports]阮光銘, Administrative Director of the Municipal Police Bureau and Director of the Opium Suppression and Investigation Institute, hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at the new location of the institute, 99 Sinan Road, at 3 PM yesterday.劉學海, Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in the Shanghai-Suzhou Area of the Ministry of the Interior, also attended. First, 阮氏 reported on the general situation of the implementation of the opium suppression policy in the city since its inception, stating that the Opium Suppression and Investigation Institute was established in April of last year. At that time, due to limited funding, it was first attached to the Police Academy. It was not until November 10 of this year that it moved into its new location. Currently, the institute has investigated and dealt with 5,308 opium addicts, including 3,483 males. However, 阮氏 estimates that in addition to those who have already registered for investigation, there are approximately 30,000 to 50,000 opium addicts in the city who still do not know how to reform and secretly use drugs. In order to thoroughly eradicate opium, the institute is giving them a final opportunity to register with the Shanghai Branch of the Opium Suppression Association or the various district offices for investigation before the end of this year. Otherwise, once arrested, they will be severely punished. Then, Special Commissioner 劉 addressed the audience, stating that according to central government laws, the opium suppression work in the city should have been completed by the end of this year, but based on the current situation, it will inevitably be extended again. At the same time, the central government's opium suppression laws will also be revised. 劉氏 continued to state that Shanghai has now become a center for opium trafficking, transportation and manufacturing, so the opium suppression policy is particularly important. In the past, the Police Bureau has achieved great results in investigation work, and should be strengthened in the future. 劉氏 also revealed that the city will soon establish an opium detective network jointly by military and police agencies, which will conduct strict inspections in the three aspects of land, sea and air. Finally, 阮氏 led reporters to visit the living conditions of the male and female drug suspect who are currently under investigation at the institute. The visit ended at around 5 PM.</p>

<p>New Interpretation of the Universal Principles and Virtues - Yan Qun</p>
<p>The Doctrine of the Mean states: "There are five universal principles in the world, and three ways to practice them. They are: the relationship between ruler and subject, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder and younger brothers, and the interactions between friends – these five are the universal principles of the world. Knowledge, benevolence, and courage are the universal virtues of the world; the way to practice them is one." These words are the foundation upon which our country's social order and ethics have rested for thousands of years. I would like to offer a new interpretation based on my limited understanding and invite scholars to examine it.</p>
<p>"Universal" means accessible and unblocked, like a road; a universal principle is like a thoroughfare. "There are five universal principles in the world" means that there are five paths that all people in all directions share. These five are also known as the five relationships, which, in modern terminology, are called "relationships." It means that humans develop their potential within these five relationships. Although political systems differ between ancient times and today, with rulers and the people holding different positions, this is merely a difference in form. In essence, the relationship between the country and its people has never changed. Therefore, the relationship between ruler and subject is the relationship between the country and its people. The relationship between father and son, husband and wife, and siblings are family relationships; as for friends, that is a social relationship. Therefore, it is said that human relationships encompass the country, the family, and society. By fully developing one's nature and talents, and bringing these five relationships to a state of perfection, the country will be well-governed, the world will be at peace, and humanity will advance.</p>
<p>The means to practice these universal principles are the universal virtues. Universal virtues are the innate abilities that all humans receive from heaven, inherent in their nature, and belong to the inner self. The universal principles, on the other hand, are the paths that humans tread in the universe after they are born, belonging to the external world. By practicing these universal virtues to carry out these universal principles, one fulfills one's heavenly duty and accomplishes human affairs. Knowledge as a virtue is the ability to distinguish right from wrong, good from evil, and thereby understand ethics; benevolence as a virtue is the ability to empathize with each other, sharing joys and sorrows, and thereby nurture human relationships; courage as a virtue is the ability to strengthen this empathy and persevere without giving up. In short, knowledge is the ability to discern, benevolence is the nature of empathy, and courage is the power to act. Without knowledge, one cannot see the correctness of ethics; without benevolence, ethics will dissipate; without courage, ethical actions cannot be carried out.</p>
<p>Zhu Xi commented on knowledge, benevolence, and courage, saying: "Knowledge is for understanding this (referring to the universal principle, note by Zhou); benevolence is for embodying this; courage is for strengthening this." The term "embodying" is like the colloquial term "comprehending" or "being considerate," meaning to put oneself in another's shoes, achieving empathy. In modern terminology, it is called "sympathy." Sympathy comes from the Greek word "Sunpatheia," where "sun" means "with" or "together," and "Patheia" is rooted in "Pathein," meaning feeling or receiving. Combined, it means "sharing feelings," the so-called sharing of pain and joy. In this way, one feels as if one is of one body with another. Therefore, when discussing human relationships, the significance of the word "benevolence" indicates that individuals, though distinct, connect with each other in their hearts, as if they were one. Zhang Hengqu's saying, "Treat the people as my siblings, and all things as my companions," can be said to reveal this as clearly as the sun and moon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in ancient times, there was the saying "serve the ruler as one would serve one's father," transforming filial piety into loyalty; therefore, the ruler was also called "ruler-father." There was also the idea of "treating subjects as one would treat one's children," so subjects were also called "subject-children." Thus, the country was regarded as a family, and the people treated the country as if they were in a family. Therefore, the ancient kings governed the world with filial piety, and the emperor had the saying "the family rules the world." As for interactions between friends, the Records state: "If one is twice the age, treat them as a father; if ten years older, treat them as an elder brother; if five years older, follow them closely." (Book of Rites, Qu Li) The father's peers are addressed as uncles, and the children's peers are addressed as siblings. Thus, society is like a family. This is not to privatize the nation or narrow the scope of society; rather, it is to regard the nation and society as one family, so that the people love and care for each other, share joys and sorrows, and empathize with each other. This is the essence of benevolence in Confucianism.</p>
<p>"There are three universal virtues, and the way to practice them is one." What is this "one"? Zhu Xi considered it sincerity, which is correct. The following passage states: "If one in a lower position does not gain the trust of those above, the people cannot be governed; to gain the trust of those above, one must have faith in one's friends, otherwise one cannot gain the trust of those above; to have faith in one's friends, one must be obedient to one's parents, otherwise one cannot have faith in one's friends; to be obedient to one's parents, one must reflect on oneself and be sincere, otherwise one cannot be obedient to one's parents." The so-called gaining the trust of those above is the business of the ruler-subject relationship; having faith in one's friends is the business of the friend-friend relationship; being obedient to one's parents is the business of the father-son relationship, extending to the business of the husband-wife and sibling relationships; and the ultimate path to obeying parents lies in reflecting on oneself and being sincere. Gaining the trust of those above, being obedient to one's parents, and reflecting on oneself and being sincere – from this, it can be seen that while carrying out the affairs of the five relationships through the paths of knowledge, benevolence, and courage is essential, if one does not consistently apply sincerity, it will be of no avail. Sincerity is what we call "being serious" in colloquial language. "Being serious" implies responsibility. Understanding principles must be true, which is the work of knowledge; after understanding the principles, one must proceed with a genuine and conscientious attitude, which is the work of action. When knowledge, benevolence, and courage all stem from sincerity, then one's knowledge will be undoubtedly true, one's pursuit of benevolence will be undoubtedly genuine, one's exercise of courage will be undoubtedly appropriate, and one's application to the affairs of the five relationships will be undoubtedly complete.</p>
<h3>Regional Design: A Blueprint for a Prosperous Nation and People - Li Chunfen</h3>
<p>The prosperity of a nation and its people depends on construction, and the success of construction depends on the quality of planning. National construction is not like building castles in the air; it must be based on the actual environment and involve planned development. This means that the scale of national construction must be based on regional construction, analyzing the actual environment of each region, identifying the specific problems and needs of each region, and developing various plans to serve as the foundation for regional construction. Only in this way can we create a blueprint for national construction and deeply root the foundation for the prosperity of the nation and its people. Therefore, regional planning is an essential step in regional construction or development.</p>
<p>The Nature of Regional Design: Many regional designs use political regions as spatial units, which is not practical. While a country's resources vary by region, their distribution is also uneven. Moreover, within a country's borders, the terrain, climate, hydrology, land use, and local customs do not suddenly change with the crossing of county or provincial boundaries. Therefore, plans for development and rational utilization must be tailored to local conditions. In other words, design and policymaking should align with actual natural or economic regions. From a geographical perspective, regional design and development involve overlaying a new layer of human construction on the natural environment of the region, harmonizing the distribution patterns of the two. Therefore, all factors related to regional prosperity and their interrelationships must be thoroughly analyzed and comprehensively studied. This means that the design of all construction projects must be based on the inherent characteristics of the region itself, determining not only the content of the design but also the spatial scope of the region. If political regions are used as design units, a cohesive entity will be fragmented, and the development of the entire region or the resolution of problems cannot be comprehensively planned. As a result, fragmented efforts will lead to neglecting some aspects while focusing on others. Sometimes, conflicts of interest may prevent problems from being resolved, leading to endless disputes.</p>
<p>The Geographical Foundation of Regional Design: As mentioned above, the nature of the region itself determines the content of regional design, and each region has its own unique characteristics, so the design projects will also vary. However, design and policymaking are always based on the geographical background. All natural and human elements within the region, both dynamic and static, are objects of research and investigation. This includes land, power sources, products, transportation, population, cities, and so on. Each element must be thoroughly analyzed and studied in terms of its nature, distribution patterns, and the ways it affects utilization or is being utilized. It is essential to understand whether the utilization of resources within the region is in harmony with the natural environment, whether resources are being used to their full potential, and whether there is waste or misuse that leads to adverse consequences. Excess and deficiency are not signs of a healthy and rational system, and they require improvement or re-planning to ensure that resource development and utilization have a harmonious relationship with their direct environment.</p>
<p>Regarding the dynamics of human elements, such as population migration, factory relocation, and commodity transportation, the design should guide these trends in a way that integrates them into the normal trajectory. It should maximize efficiency under the principle of benefiting the entire region, rather than allowing them to develop on their own and letting nature take its course. In addition, problems related to the prosperity of the region that involve other regions should also be considered comprehensively. For example, if a coastal commercial port is experiencing excessive expansion, leading to overcrowding and traffic congestion, the solution to these problems requires coordination with nearby cities and ports. This involves planning how to disperse the excessive population and making reasonable adjustments to the distribution of goods to avoid an imbalance and harm to urban health.</p>
<p>The Focus of Regional Design: The above discussion focuses on regional design for economic development, but the focus of design varies from place to place. Some designs emphasize political management, social welfare, economic development, or national defense. For example, in France, regional design focuses on politics to facilitate the management of political units, and the same is true in Siberia. Similarly, the redrawing of provincial districts by Mr. Hu Huan-yong and Mr. Hong in our country is also a regional design with a political focus. The United States is representative of those focusing on economic development, with the TVA being an example. The YVA and KVA being implemented in our country also fall into this category. The urban regional design currently prevalent in various countries aims to improve the living environment of cities and enhance the performance of various functional areas, such as preventing the occurrence of slum areas, reducing traffic congestion, and building new satellite cities to alleviate urban overpopulation. Its focus is on the social aspects. The so-called Garden City movement in England also has its focus here.</p>
<p>The Dynamics of Regional Design in Various Countries After the War: European countries were directly affected by the war, with many towns and villages destroyed and people displaced. In the Americas, especially North America, the increase in urban population has made housing a problem. Therefore, in the past two years, regional design activities in Europe and the United States have focused on the planning and development of towns and villages and solving the housing shortage. Central and local design agencies are working together to restore, expand, or rebuild existing towns and villages. In 1946, twenty-eight of the forty-eight states in the United States passed legislation on town construction. In the same year, the British Parliament also passed a law establishing new towns, with plans to build twenty new towns, ten of which are located near London, with the aim of dispersing the congestion in London. Although constrained by material resources, European countries are also making progress in town design. Construction plans for several towns in the Soviet Union were approved as early as 1945. France has also begun to actively promote town reconstruction plans. Italy established a joint design committee last year to oversee various plans for the reconstruction of disaster areas. Other cities, such as Warsaw in Poland and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, are also designing and striving for restoration. In the past two years, town design can be described as a surge of activity, reaching a peak.</p>
<h3>A Dangerous Figure? Bergson - You Wei</h3>
<p>Henri Bergson, the modern French philosopher, is a well-known figure in our country's intellectual circles. His major works, such as "Creative Evolution," "Matter and Memory," "Time and Free Will," and "An Introduction to Metaphysics," have all been translated into Chinese. He was once passionately admired by our country's intellectuals, but now he seems to have been forgotten by us.</p>
<p>Although we have forgotten him, the French have not. After Bergson's death (he died in 1941), his works have become more popular. The number of people reading his work is increasing daily. All those who lean leftward in their thinking like to read his books. Bergson's admirers have shifted from academia to the streets. Therefore, the recent American political commentator Walter Lippmann called him "the most dangerous figure in the world."</p>
<p>Bergson, a dangerous figure! This cannot help but surprise us. His thinking is not left-leaning. He is not like the English philosopher Bertrand Russell, who still has some sympathy for the Soviet Union or communism. He rarely makes political pronouncements. He is also not opposed to religion. Where does his danger lie? His danger lies in his philosophy. In philosophy, he argues that everything changes, and everything exists in a state of constant flux, with nothing remaining static. The flow of time is creative, continuous, and cumulative, with each moment being different from the last. Under this argument, politics, society, religion, morality, and all customs and institutions naturally cannot be exceptions and must be subject to the changes of time. In other words, he advocates overthrowing the status quo. All those who are dissatisfied with the status quo and want to overthrow it are naturally drawn to him. Many French people are currently dissatisfied with the status quo, which is why Bergson is so popular, and that is where his danger lies.</p>
<p>I would not dare say that Bergson's thought is dangerous because there are many people who share his views. If it is dangerous, it only proves that thinking is powerful and can influence society or change existence.</p>
<h3>The Propagation of Population - Fang Zheng</h3>
<p>It is inevitable that population increases geometrically. Because two becomes four, then four must become eight. The problem is that it is difficult for most people to imagine how fast the population can propagate when it increases geometrically. Unless a concrete example is used to illustrate it, it may be difficult for the average person to grasp the seriousness of the population propagation prospect.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the Chinese nation only migrated or originated in East Asia 5,000 years ago. Let us also assume that China's population has propagated at a constant rate from ancient times to the present. Even if this rate is very low, as low as an increase of only seven per thousand per year, that is to say, after one year, out of every 1,000 people, after deducting deaths, 1,007 people remain. This is equivalent to saying that in 100 years, 1,000 people will propagate into 2,000 people. The population only doubles in 100 years, and the propagation rate is not high because Western Europe increased this number in the 19th century, even though there were constant wars, revolutions, famines, and epidemics in Western Europe in the 19th century. In a backward area of the United States, Ruerto Rico, the residents of this island, although medicine is backward and the mortality rate is high, the annual propagation rate is 2.3 percent, that is, the population doubles in 30 years. 100 years is three or four generations, and the population doubles in three or four generations, which is not considered a high rate. But if we propagate at this rate, then even if our ancestors were only two people 5,000 years ago, then after 5,000 years today, our population would exceed 20 million billion, that is, 20 million million million people, which is more than 10 million times the population of the entire earth today. Some people yearn for a future world where there is no worry about food and clothing, but how much land would 20 million billion people need to live? Even if science advances, the entire land area of the earth (about 51 million square miles), regardless of ice, cold, heat, miasma, high mountains, and barren valleys, can be inhabited. To allow 20 million billion people to have a sleeping area of three feet wide and six feet long, unless the whole world is built like the 30-story buildings in New York City, with no gaps at all, our great nation will have a place to sleep. In addition to this, there is no place for eating, living, culture, and enjoyment. Such a world is naturally impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, the population must be limited in any case, whether such restrictions are natural or artificial. In the past, natural restrictions on excessive population propagation were famine and war, disease and epidemics. Some people even believe that this is the main reason for progress or evolution, the so-called natural selection, survival of the fittest, and only then can the race progress. This evolutionary theory has long been untenable in the face of various facts in modern embryology. We hope that mankind can grasp its own destiny. Famine and disease should be banished from the world with the progress of science, and war is also hoped to be avoided. Limiting population propagation should be controlled by humans.</p>
<p>Past facts tell us that the birth control movement (artificial production restriction) has produced extremely bad results. This is the so-called Differential fertility. The more excellent the propagation rate is, the lower it is, and the more ignorant and poor, the higher the propagation force is. For example, the urban population statistics of the United States in 1935. The fertility rate for those with an annual income of over $3,000 was 0.46 (in other words, even if the fertility rate is doubled, it still cannot maintain the population from decreasing). The fertility rate for those with an annual income of $1,500 to $2,000 was 0.70; the fertility rate for those with an annual income of less than $1,000 was 0.93. Therefore, the urban population is not enough to maintain the population from decreasing, only those who are too poor to support themselves have a fertility rate as high as 1.43. The difference in education level is also the same. The fertility rate for college graduates is 0.57, the fertility rate for high school graduates is 0.77, and the fertility rate for elementary school graduates is 1.18. This difference in fertility rate, even if it can maintain the population equilibrium, can greatly affect the quality of the population, and this method of restricting the population is too costly.</p>
<p>The impact of differential fertility on the population can be illustrated by intelligence. According to extremely conservative estimates, as Haldane estimates in his book "Heredity and Politics," if the fertility rate of the upper class remains so low, and the fertility rate of the lower class remains so high, the average IQ of each generation will be 1 to 2 percent lower. Thus, in a few dozen generations, the absolute majority of all mankind will become idiots. Or some people do not believe that intelligence is entirely determined by heredity. But even from the position of environmentalists, he must admit that handing over the next generation to those who cannot support themselves, are ignorant and irresponsible parents, the education of the next generation is very problematic. If acquired upbringing can determine a person's intelligence, the result of differential fertility is still no different from that of heredity theorists. Thus, population policy is a very important issue in today's society. How to maintain the quality and quantity of the population to a perfect state is a problem that anyone who cares about the nation must pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Academic Forestry Talks - Zhang Qiyun</h3>
<p>Provincial District Issues</p>
<p>There are currently two factions, for and against, on the issue of provincial district reform, and debates have already begun. The author is one of those who advocate shrinking provincial districts. Recently, I drafted an article entitled "Provincial District Review," which will be published in the 49th issue of Ideals and Times (in print), and re-studies the theory of shrinking provinces. Briefly, if one can carefully examine the intent of the Constitution, it is not difficult to dispel all the doubts of the opposition. The author deeply agrees with the intent of President Zhang Qun's speech, believing that establishing provinces is indeed one of the biggest issues in nation-building. Precisely because this matter is of great importance, it is necessary to be cautious in handling it, in order to gain the sympathy of the majority of the people. A reporter from Ta Kung Pao said that there is no need to list this as the first major event of constitutional governance in times of war and chaos, and it is not too late to implement it when peace and unity are achieved. The author would like to offer a further explanation, even if peace and unity have already been achieved, it still needs to be carefully reviewed by all levels of public opinion organs to complete the legislative procedures. It is absolutely not possible for the government to make partial reforms to provincial districts with a single order, otherwise, it will disrupt the process and inevitably lead to unnecessary disputes.</p>
<p>In 1931, the author drafted an article entitled "Basic Principles for Reforming Provincial Districts" (published in the Current Affairs Monthly), and its conclusion was that the reform of provincial districts must go through three stages: first, the preparatory period, second, the debate period, and third, the implementation period. There are currently at least five specific plans for reforming provincial districts (Hu Huanyong, Huang Guozhang, Hong Fubo, Lao Gan, Zhang Qiyun). The author has not yet seen the plan proposed by the Ministry of Interior's Fangyu Division. The preparatory period can temporarily be brought to an end, and now should be the beginning of the debate period. The National Assembly for constitutional governance is about to convene. The government should submit this case to the Assembly for discussion, summarize the opinions of representatives from various provinces, and first make a conceptual examination. If the principle of shrinking provinces is approved by the Assembly, a joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should be convened to review the specific plan, based on public opinion, expert reports, and the views of colleagues from the two Yuan, to conduct research and consider it in detail. Then, a small group review meeting should be established to create a hypothetical regional map based on the discussion results, with a description attached. Then, the government will send it to the provincial assemblies of various provinces for reconsideration. The provincial assemblies will then consult the opinions of the county assemblies, discuss back and forth, and strive for perfection. Then, from the bottom up, the government will summarize public opinion and make judgments. At this point, the debate period will be over. After the formal legislative procedure is completed, the government can promulgate the new Anqu District map and order the simultaneous implementation throughout the country. The great cause of nation-building must make the people sincerely convinced before it can conform to the democratic rule.</p>
<p>New National Defense Theory</p>
<p>What is the impact of the rise of air power on the old sea power and land inspection? This is a prerequisite for today's discussion of national defense. Land power refers to the armed forces operating on land, with land fortresses as their base. Sea power refers to the armed forces operating at sea, with naval ports as their base. The area along the sea-Han can be used by warships to transport troops ashore, which is called the overlapping zone of sea power and land power. The air force's operations depend on land, sea, or both. Since the air force cannot be independent of the army and navy, air power can be regarded as an extension and expansion of sea power and land power. However, the air force has the greatest fluidity. The navy and army can assist each other very quickly with the help of the air force. Furthermore, using the air force to directly destroy the enemy's economic organization is erratic, and it seems to be a new strategy for the sudden rise of the military. The current military situation is that air power is still difficult to independently constitute a third type of armed force, but it is not easy to completely integrate it into the land power and sea power systems. The most significant impact of the air force is that it can converge the sea and land, making the clear distinction between sea power and land power no longer exist. As a result, the old three-element defense has evolved into a new one-element national defense. Recently, the governments of various countries in the world have reformed their systems, and the Ministry of Navy and the Ministry of Army have mostly merged to form the Ministry of National Defense, which comprehensively manages the three armies, in order to meet the requirements of the new era. As for the invention of rockets and atomic bombs, as well as the brewing bacterial warfare, I am afraid that the factors of position and distance in national defense will be reduced to nothing. This is not only a major revolution in strategy but also an unprecedented change in geography. The future of the world is truly difficult to predict.</p>

<p>Free Talk - Observations in the Old Capital - Fa Hui Ze Wen</p>
<p>The "Patrol Post Cars" of the Pingjin News are designed to facilitate the citizens' sending letters. Every day, they stop at certain stations for two or three hours at a fixed time. The stopping place is selected about one mile away from the nearby post office, so that people know the time to go to the car to send letters nearby, so as to save the trouble of walking. This was originally a good idea. However, the situation in the old capital is different from that of the bustling and densely populated cities outside. The distance between the post offices is mostly no more than two miles, and there is also a "Dao Di Postcard" in the middle, which can send plain letters, and there is no inconvenience in habits. Moreover, the patrol post car has a time limit, and the people have to wait, and still have to run the road (the stopping place of the car is in the David Center, which is quite far away from the households in the various lanes), so they don't pay much attention to it. It often stays for a long time, and no one asks about it. The military is of milk-white and oil-blue colors, which is very beautiful. The cabinets and seats in the car are equipped like a small house, and the people in the car are quite leisurely.</p>
<p>The "post kiosks" added at the critical intersections have very good business. The post kiosk is shaped like a cigarette kiosk, and also looks like an electric car ticket office. It stands alone, with a milk-white top and walls, blue-green lines, and the words "post kiosk" at the top, also in white letters on a green background, clean and beautiful. It is also full of poetic and artistic sentiments, making people think of painting on the wall of a tavern.</p>
<p>There are many American goods in Ping City, but the sales are not all booming. For example, cigarettes can be said to be a popular addiction. There are cigarette shops and stalls one after another on the streets and alleys, and there are colorful colors everywhere. However, most of the people passing by on the streets buy the exports of Shanghai companies. Only a few aristocratic American-style modern people think that American cigarettes are fashionable and occasionally patronize them. Therefore, cigarette stalls only have one-tenth or two-tenths of "Philips" and "Red Light" prepared, and listed on the upper layer, just to connect them. Shen cigarettes are densely layered, followed by Tianjin products, which are lower in price and quality, and small vendors like to buy them. Also, such as glass skin and glass silk products, except for cloth companies and new-style stores, they are rarely seen in ordinary city stores and stalls. Occasionally, combs and ribbons are listed on the stalls, but they are not welcomed. Local women also think that they are easily broken children's toys. Also, canned goods are indeed "cheap and good", but they are not well known by the public. Most people do not know the foreign languages on them, and they cannot open them.</p>
<p>(People in the old capital buy food and talk about safety first and then buy). Moreover, there are too many types, eating and using (such as shoe polish and insecticide) are all beautiful tin cans, I really don't know "what is sold in the gourd", "old Beijing" people look and leave.</p>
<p>The old capital mixed grains (coarse grains for the people) have been sold for 8,000 yuan per catty, and a large can of American dry powder (bean curd), weighing five pounds, is sold for 40,000 yuan. And the people in between only say that this can is worth 20,000 yuan, but they don't know what is inside. Its exquisitely packaged turkey costs more than two pounds per can, and it is deboned pure meat, and the price is only 50,000 yuan (live chickens in the vegetable market cost 50,000, 60,000, 70,000, or 80,000 yuan each, and the amount of meat is only a quarter of this can), but no one asks about it. Once a friend asked me, what does Turkey mean? I replied "turkey", then he exclaimed: "Turkey is poisonous, how can it be eaten?" I said that this is an American chicken, that is, the chicken for eating, and the quality is similar to Chicken in Western food, and there is no other difference, but he is still suspicious. Only milk powder and Cheese are very popular, and the price is also soaring, because there are many teachers, staff and students in the academic circles who are the main customers.</p>
<h3>Lonely Harmony - Bin Ru</h3>
<p>There is a small beef shop here, specializing in beef snacks, such as beef dumplings, pot stickers, buns, beef tripe, beef soup, etc., which are all delicious and cheap.</p>
<p>Probably small shops are like this, from the boss to the guys, they are a family, and everything is very harmonious, making the customers who come to spend money feel comfortable sitting down. I often spend my time here.</p>
<p>There are also those fellow customers, rickshaw drivers, workers, vendors, who are all dirty, but looking at the large stack of banknotes they take out, in addition to filling themselves, they must be able to support other people, which is also a reassuring thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can see a foreigner who has had enough wine and comes to drink again. When he staggers into the door, the boss will definitely speak Shanghainese to him:</p>
<p>"Hello, hello, why haven't you come for a long time?"</p>
<p>The foreigner always nods with a smile and says:</p>
<p>"No money, no money, I don't come if I have no money."</p>
<p>It is authentic foreign Shanghainese, and then he takes out a 5,000 yuan legal tender. Without ordering, the shopkeeper takes it and calls to get a glass of Wu Jiapi. The foreigner divides it into three mouthfuls, drinks it all, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, and then staggers away. He always turns his head and waves when he reaches the door, and says "See you tomorrow". He only leaves his own impression on others, and does not think about who is next to him.</p>
<p>This small shop also has a radio. Because the boss likes to listen to Peking Opera, he often receives Peking Opera records or broadcasts. One night the boss asked me:</p>
<p>"Do you also like to listen to opera?"</p>
<p>At this time, the radio was playing Yan Jupeng's voice, desolate, vicissitudes, which I thought was the best, so I told him: I also like to listen, but I don't like to listen to Ma Lianliang or Mei Lanfang, I want to listen to Gao Qingkui, I want to listen to Jin Shaoshan, and especially like Yan Jupeng.</p>
<p>When the boss heard my words, he couldn't help but sigh and said: "Ah! You are really a scholar, Yan is also a scholar, no wonder you prefer him, haha!"</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why I especially love Yan Jupeng is not because of his scholar background, but I always feel that his voice is used better than anyone else's. Every word is so tightly fastened (not just accurately bitten), and it becomes a powerful thing invisibly, deeply hitting people's hearts, and is very harmonious with this desolate, lonely, and colorful world.</p>
<h3>Judgment - Ge Chunliang</h3>
<p>"Mr. Lawyer is the smartest and most wise person in the city, which everyone admits, without a doubt. One day, a young man in the crowd asked him, 'Mr. Lawyer,' he said, 'How did you become so smart and know so much?'"</p>
<p>"Good and accurate judgment." Mr. Lawyer said without fear, "I can say that it must be because of my good and accurate judgment!"</p>
<p>"Then, where did your good and accurate judgment come from?"</p>
<p>"I got that from experience."</p>
<p>"Then, where did your experience come from?"</p>
<p>"I got that from my wrong judgments!"</p>
<h3>On "Drilling" - Ji Yong</h3>
<p>Zhang Duanyi's Gui Er Ji is an interesting book. Volume does not record the Taishi chair, one of the items, which says:</p>
<p>"The school chair of today (that is, the cross chair) is the ancient Hu bed. From the past, there was only a material sample, and the prime ministers and attendants all used it. Because Qin Shiyuan (that is, painting) believed in the national taboo for a moment, his turban fell. Jingyin Wu Yuan flattered the prime minister and came up with the idea of ​​making forty handles of lotus leaf trays, and rushed to the national taboo, leaving the craftsmen to add them in an instant, and all the prime ministers and attendants had them, so they were called Taishi style."</p>
<p>A chair is so small, and there is such a shameless fact, which is really unexpected. The power of Prime Minister Qin that day must have been known. However, the flatterers also understood the truth. Forty lotus leaf heads were made, and the prime ministers all had them. In my hometown, a gentleman hosted a county magistrate, and specially set up a table. When he sat down, he shouted: "The seat is prepared for the county magistrate!" Although the gentlemen did not dare to compare, they were unhappy. This is called drilling also has a way. Zhao Shi's "crowing and barking" to Han Tuozhou was too much. It not only shamed himself, but also made the descendants feel very uncomfortable when they saw it. Therefore, Wu Gongyuan is quite worthy of incense.</p>
<p>The first class has the first class of drilling, and it is mainly to "get my heart first". How did Qin Hui succeed? His magic weapon is "peace". He saw that King Kang had no intention of fighting anymore—if Emperor Qinzong was really welcomed back, how would King Kang be the emperor! So Yue Fei was a fool—he took the blame for the emperor and was scolded by the world. Later generations knew the danger of the Qin family, but they did not know the more dangerous and more evil of Gaozong. One of the items in the Gui Er Ji volume says:</p>
<p>"One day, Qin Hui was so bold that Emperor Gaozong's face was unhappy. Kui said, what is the matter that makes the emperor worried? He replied: There are 5 million branches of silk and cloth in Jiaoji. He said: The minister should take care of this matter for His Majesty. (According to the Song system, after the Jiaoji ceremony, the ministers must be rewarded, which costs a lot.) Suddenly one day he reported: I beg the forbidden city to give the minister four golden pots of wine. He will be declared on a certain day, Qin Yue Zhang Han two generals (should be Zhang Jun, Han Shizhong) to discuss matters. From the morning to noon and afternoon, he did not get an audience, but saw the envoy declared the royal wine to come, and his heart became more confused and surprised. He moved, Qin and Zhang Wei said, and did not say a word. Suddenly he said: Royal wine is given in front of the emperor, drink a cup together. Zhang Han was terrified and did not dare to drink. Qin first took a sip of wine and drank it safely. After a while, he slowly said: The emperor wants to give each of the two generals 10 million yuan to pay for the Jiaoji ceremony, and then allocate it after the ceremony. Zhang Fajijin ordered and reported to Emperor Gaozong, and he was ordered to lend only 500 thousand yuan."</p>
<p>After seeing Zhang Han's demeanor, I really feel unbearable. If that is poison, what is there to manage? But it also shows that Qin is not easy to mess with. In the era of warlords, many people used this technique to kidnap tickets. Of course, there are also those who stole the position by this method. Zeng Zhi's cleverness is deeply pleasing to the ear.

<h3>Assisting with the Handling of Reparations Materials: Allied Headquarters Experts Arrive in Shanghai in Batches; Campbell and Others Arrive in Nanjing for Official Business</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Allied Headquarters, in order to understand the preparations for our country's reception of reparations materials, has decided to send more than ten experts in three batches to China for investigation and research. The list has been sent to the relevant agencies in our country. Currently, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Belsher, who have arrived in China, are the first batch. It is reported that another high-ranking expert will arrive in Shanghai this week. Mr. Campbell and Mr. Belsher will stay in China for about a week.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Thinking of the Disaster Victims in the Cold of Winter</h3>
<p>After a heavy snowfall, the weather in Shanghai has turned very cold. Although the sun has come out in recent days, the cold air remains strong. The Siberian cold wave reached Shanghai on the 15th, and the actual temperature dropped to minus 5.7 degrees Celsius. According to the astronomical observatory, such severe cold has not been seen in seventy years, except for 1925. It is predicted that this cold wave will continue to invade the city. Christmas and New Year's Day will both be spent in the midst of severe cold.</p>
<p>Severe cold may not be a seasonal experience for a certain group of people: they live in mansions with water heaters and fireplaces, and they can sit comfortably and travel quickly in new cars. They wear precious furs and fine jewelry. The cold weather cannot pose the slightest threat to them. Moreover, the colorful snowflakes and the snow-covered earth can be regarded as beautiful scenery for entertainment. With Christmas and New Year approaching, they are busy preparing food and wine, feasting friends, and engaging in lively celebrations. As for the general public, they are struggling under the high pressure of life, constantly striving for profit, and although they are deeply troubled by the hardships of the year, they are not at risk of losing their lives. The ones who are most bullied by the cold weather are the tens of thousands of poor and helpless disaster victims!</p>
<p>In any street and corner of the city, you can see disaster victims shivering with their arms folded: they are hungry all day long and poorly clothed. They "prostrate themselves on the ground" on the sidewalks, push tricycles on the bridge piers, stretch out their skinny hands to beg from pedestrians on the streets, and huddle together in hidden alleys. Especially when the night is deep and quiet, they huddle together in the vegetable markets and under the eaves, constantly suffering from the invasion of the north wind. Often, dozens of people die overnight. This is truly a tragic scene of human hell!</p>
<p>They are both citizens of Shanghai, but for one part, the severe cold is enough to enjoy and entertain, while the other part sacrifices their lives in the severe cold. This is truly a stark contrast.</p>
<p>In modern cities, it is a common problem that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In Shanghai, China, this situation is even more acute. The formation of these groups of disaster victims is nothing more than the result of the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the victims of which have not yet recovered, and the cruel destruction by the communists during the two years of turmoil. North of the Yangtze River, which is not accessible from Shanghai, is disturbed by the communists and lurking local communists. Under their ruthless "liquidation," "struggle," "grabbing grain," and "joining the army" activities, the rich have become the targets of liquidation, and the poor have become the targets of coercion, causing the vast rural areas to fall into a state of production collapse and people displacement. People in these areas, without clothing or food, live from day to day, and turn to Shanghai in the hope of finding opportunities for livelihood and assistance. However, Shanghai not only did not give them job opportunities, but even did not give them a foothold, so their fate is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Of course, the fundamental solution to relieving disaster victims is to suppress the communists so that people can live and work in peace and contentment, and so that the vast number of farmers can return to the countryside. However, the work of suppressing the rebellion cannot be completed in the short term, and rescuing the dying and healing the wounded is urgent. Therefore, before the fundamental solution is completed, the partial rescue is the most urgent task at present.</p>
<p>Under the active promotion of the municipal government and people from all walks of life, the winter relief work in Shanghai has begun, and the following items are being held:</p>
<p>Charity performances are held in various theaters, which are expected to generate 20 billion yuan.</p>
<p>House rent fee, which can generate 30 billion yuan.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wu's speech on the 8th of this month, 20 billion yuan has been raised.</p>
<p>The income from the above three items has reached 70 billion yuan, which seems to exceed the original target of 60 billion yuan.</p>
<p>As for the relief situation: Three shelters have been set up, which can accommodate 4,500 people in total, and more than 800 people have been received. Eleven work-relief shelters can accommodate about 3,000 people. The municipal government assists charitable organizations in setting up eleven porridge distribution points from January 1 of next year, which can provide food for 15,000 people every day. In addition, medical treatment and corpse collection are also being handled by public and private charitable organizations.</p>
<p>We assume that there are 70,000 disaster victims in Shanghai who are in urgent need of relief, which is a total of 70 billion yuan. Each person can get 1 million yuan in relief funds, and the three months of severe winter can be barely survived. However, it is still just the beginning. To achieve the above goals, we still need to work hard continuously.</p>
<p>We must point out that, in addition to the active promotion by the municipal government, those who are enthusiastically engaged in relief work are mostly small and medium-sized citizens, while the generous donations from wealthy merchants and tycoons are still not common. Relieving disaster victims is based on human compassion, based on compatriot love, maintaining social stability, ensuring the lives of people who do not want to be enslaved by the communists, and warming their spirits, which is also indirectly mobilizing for suppressing the rebellion. We hope that the government and the general public will complete the winter relief work with the greatest enthusiasm and perseverance, and we also hope that the rich can arouse their conscience, and that the municipal government will propose effective donation methods for the rich, and use their excessive wealth on the dying disaster victims.</p>
<p>Fang En's Report</p>
<p>Mr. Fang En, manager of the Asia branch of the United Press, held talks with senior Chinese and American officials in the city last week and reached a conclusion that if the United States announced a broad aid plan to the Chinese National Government to defeat the Chinese Communists, the Soviet Union would inevitably retreat and would not interfere in China's internal unrest or provide military assistance to the Communist army in Northeast and North China by force. The reasons he cited are as follows: Although the Soviet Union has provided the Chinese Communists with military weapons and ammunition seized from the Japanese army in Northeast China and Korea, and may still transport limited supplies to the Chinese Communists through ports such as Vladivostok and Dalian, the Soviet Union cannot risk a full-scale conflict with the United States in order to control Asia. If the United States announces a broad aid plan to the Chinese National Government, the Soviet Union will inevitably launch a large-scale propaganda offensive; however, China and the United States can formally point out that the Soviet Union has not only failed to comply with the Yalta Agreement to open Lushun and Dalian, but has also ignored the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, refusing to hand over the Lushun and Dalian to China, thus counteracting the Soviet propaganda offensive. China and the United States can also issue a joint declaration in the United Nations framework with other countries, pointing out that the Soviet Union's actions in Northeast China are enough to constitute a threat to peace. In this way, the Soviet Union can be defeated in the diplomatic offensive.</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Fang En's report, we suddenly realized that the United States still has some concerns about the issue of aid to China. It is not afraid of the opposition of the American people, but of the interference of the Soviet Union. Mr. Fang En's explanation is well-founded and reasonable in addressing this point. However, from our point of view, we believe that the United States' concern about the interference of the Soviet Union is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>After World War II, the main players on the international stage are only the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States is committed to world peace everywhere. Whether in Europe or Asia, it hopes that peace can be achieved, so it always adopts a cautious and forbearing attitude. However, the Soviet Union only seeks its own security. Whether in Europe or Asia, it hopes to expand its power indefinitely and create a "safe zone" that is as stable as Mount Tai. The Soviet Union already has its iron curtain in Europe, and it also has its iron curtain in Asia. However, in terms of its focus, it is obviously more focused on Europe. The reason why the Soviet Union wants to organize the new Communist International, why it resolutely opposes the American aid plan to Europe, and why it adopts an uncompromising attitude at the London Foreign Ministers Conference, even to the point of willingly making the four-country foreign ministers unhappy, is entirely to expand the Soviet Union's power in Europe in order to compete with the United States. As for the Soviet Union's attitude towards Asia, although it also has the same ambitions and intentions, the situation in Asia is not entirely the same as that in Europe. The biggest difference is that there is China in Asia.</p>
<p>Although China today is experiencing internal turmoil due to the Chinese Communists' armed rebellion, the Chinese government not only can still control the entire country, but is also the only legitimate government. Its consistent diplomatic policy will not change due to internal problems. According to our country's basic policy, we not only wish to maintain friendly and close relations with the United States, but also wish to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, as long as the Soviet Union can truly abide by and fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Therefore, in any international conference, whenever the United States and the Soviet Union are deadlocked, our country always mediates between them and puts forward compromise proposals to reconcile the views of both sides. If the Soviet Union has no other intentions towards China, it seems that it cannot have unfriendly actions towards China. Moreover, China today is independent and complete, and its internal affairs do not allow interference from other countries. Therefore, the United States' aid to China does not need to take the Soviet Union into account in any case.</p>
<p>However, the crux of the Chinese problem lies in the Chinese Communists' armed rebellion, attempting to economically drag down the National Government; the hidden worry in Asia lies in the Chinese Communists' collusion with the Soviet Union to organize the Far East Communist International, attempting to gradually and completely bring the entire Asia under the Soviet Union's iron curtain. The American diplomatic authorities should recognize that the crisis in the Far East is enough to constitute a source of world turmoil and threaten world peace. They must not hesitate and hesitate any longer. There is an old saying in ancient China: "Hesitation leads to trouble." The time is extremely urgent, and aid to China cannot be delayed. We hope that the American authorities can pay close attention to Mr. Fang En's report!</p>
