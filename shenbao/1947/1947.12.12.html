<h3>津浦路浦濟段通車　今晨舉行紀念大典　明年元日起加開特快車</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日電〕勝利以來此溝通南北之大動脈津浦路浦。濟段，十一日首次順利恢復通車。十日下午四時由浦口開出之第一列專車，已於十一日下午五時一刻於濟南各界代表三百餘人及軍樂悠揚聲中徐徐開入濟南車站，濟市人民於歡欣鼓舞之餘，莫不以最熟烈心情迎接此劃時代之盛舉。對由京滬遠米之一百三十餘各界首長陳部長啓天，薩司長福均及中外同業，莫不表示由衷歡迎。</p>
<p>又，濟，兗段第七七。七八次混合列車，十一日晨六時首次南開，三等車票價爲十一萬二千元，下午六時五十分按時到達，今由濟搭車者至爲擁擠，因座滿見遺者，達三百餘人。</p>
<p>〔又電〕津浦路爲紀念浦，濟段修復通車，十一日晨八時半招待濟各界代表及新聞界共三百餘人，搭專車由濟站出發，十時半車抵　山張夏間三八四公里三零零公尺接軌處，全體下車，於接軌處攝影後，專車繼續南駛，十二時四十分抵萬德，休息十分鐘後，即折返濟市，五時平安到達，記者於車廂中見沿途民團正加緊整訓，正規軍亦加强，安全無處。又津浦路管理局，定十二日晨九時舉行通車紀念大典，北來之京。滬各界代表及中外記者爲其上賓。路局爲應渠等之請，已改定十四日以原車送渠等南返，俾得飽覽此間名勝事蹟，又局方已定廿一日起加開濟。徐間普通快車，明年元旦起加開濟。浦間特快車，並擬與京。滬綫聯運，此後南北交通當可暢達。</p>
<p>按：津浦路橫貫南北，綰　四省，爲長達一千零九公里之大動脈，被共匪破壞中斷通車達廿五個月之久，今春魯境國軍迅速挺進，魯南各地相繼收復，搶修工作隨即開始，歷經三度險阻，卒使濟浦段完全修復，正式通車。濟浦段長六百五十八公里，約佔津浦全綫三分之二，破壞極爲嚴重。</p>
<h3>通車保持常態尙待繼續奴力　陳舜耕氏盼軍方協助</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日電〕津浦區路局局長陳舜耕，於浦。濟通車典禮專重中，單獨對本報記者談稱：浦濟段雖告通車，惟以目前築路工程之因陋就簡及沿路之警備力量過低，欲使通車保持正常狀態，尚有待吾人之繼續努力，並切望軍方予以協助。由濟東南之十里堡至張店及張博支綫一段，全長一二三公里，路局已計劃搶修，刻正開始塡筑路基，該項經費億元，亦已由交部轉呈政院核　中。陳氏又稱：由濟</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日電〕交部薩司長福均，乘津浦路浦濟段通車典禮專車視察沿途情形，對搶修工和甚感滿意，渠竟日坐于列車最後之客車中，注視路軌，橋　及兩側情況。　氏于感慨槍修工款之鉅大後稱：交通當局希望鐵路通車時收入能維持開支已屬不易，遑論搶修工款。渠稱：凌次長鴻勛近由歐考察歸來，西歐各國鐵路運價均不若物價之速，但相距不遠，英物價指數漲百分之八十，運價漲百分之五十五，比物價漲百分之三百，運價漲百分之二百廿，義物價漲百分之二千，運價漲百分之九百，瑞士物價漲百分之六十，運價漲百分之五十。反觀我國運價，較戰前漲一萬倍，而物價已漲至十萬倍，交通當局希望運價上漲僅及物價上漲三分之二，即可維持各路之開支。</p>
<h3>財部修正補充有關金融法令　俟核凖後即付諸實施</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕國家行局貸款自奉諭停止以來，不時大宗貸款已告停放，即二億元以下放款及出口打包貸款亦全停止執行，可謂極端嚴格。四聯總處等機關現正乘此停放時問，對過去貸款政策加强撿討，同時，對停放後市面反響亦予以密切注意，俾作將來貸放參考，至貸放何時恢復，其原則又如何，現尚難以言定，惟信今後恢復貸放時，執行仍將極端嚴格，並重視與配合國策及民生日用工業關貸款。四聯總處理事會及小組審查會自停放以來即告停開，理事會下週可望重開，屆時當有重要討論。又此次停貸，凡前已決定貸放且已貸放一部者，機續貸予，決定貸放而尙未貸予者，則停止貸放。</p>

<p>省縣自治通則草案的商榷</p>
<p>在政府極準備行憲聲中，內政部奉行政院令，釐訂了「省（市）縣自治通則」草案，經政院審查修正，於本月九日政務會議通過，即呈國府轉立法院審議。草案計分五章，三十四條。這法案是實施地方自治的準則，行憲後的省（市）縣民代表大會制定省（市）縣自治法，必要以此母體爲依據。這是我國地方自治發展史上的一件大事，當茲草案公諸國人研討之會，我們願就所見綜合論之。</p>
<p>「省（市）縣自治通則」是憲法授權制定的法律，新憲法第一〇八條第一款所稱的「省縣自治通則」，就是規定由中央立法交由省縣執行的。關於直轄市的自治，依憲法第一一八條所載，另有法律規定：普通市的自治，依憲法第一二八條所載，準用縣之規定。我國現行之行政區域，依內政部方域司編「中華民國行政區域簡表」統計，計有三十五行省，十二直轄市，其中包括二千零二十一縣，五十一省轄市，三十八設治局，一管理局，一百三十二蒙旗，西藏一地方。這些省市縣，被認爲「地方自治單位」，國家循序行憲後，各地均須按照一定條件，一定時間，循序階升，實施自治，因此「省（市）縣自治通則」的制定頒佈，在目前是非當必要的。內政部關於通則草案的擬定，本有甲乙兩案，內容不盡相同。據原起草委員會召集人胡次威說：甲案比較「切合實際」；乙案是「近於理想」，究以何項草案爲宜，或者另有新的草案，有待行政院決定。甲案分七章，共六十七條；乙案分五章，共三十八條，兩案精神雖不盡同，然對地方制度之組織與權限，採用列舉方式，有似憲法第十第十一兩章施行法，兩案是相同的。現在政院修正的通則草案，是內政部甲案的簡化，百內容與要旨則是新的草案，並非原草案的修正。我們對通則草案的修正程序，並無意見，惟其內容，關係　重，希望行政與立法當局，能作進一步的愼重審議。</p>
<p>自治通則的要義有三；　它應該是實行地方自治共同遵循的準則，也是省（市）縣制定省（市）縣自治法的立法原則；　它應該依憲法第十第十一兩章，對地方政府之組織和權限，地方自治的範圍和標的，作施行程序上的規定。憲法設計的地方制度，有待演繹和類推之事　甚多，自治通則需要有適當之列舉，以免次來立法和司法釋義發生困難。尤其有關地方自治事項，如果通則規定完備，可以避免另頒補助　規的繁難：　它的規定應該具有極大的彈性，因爲我　幅員遼闊，各有縣情形不盡相同，法律不能以不可通而強其可通，以免將來桎梏難行，障礙自治專業的發展，失去立法的原意。職此之故，自治通則應具有獨立的精神，爲憲法施行上的便利，列舉地方自治共同遵守的準則，並不需要重抄憲法內容，或變更憲法若干條款之精神，這是行政與立法當局必須要愼重的。</p>
<p>現在行政院修正通過的自治通則草案，內容共三十四條，並元多大特點可資評述。除第二條規定，「省縣均爲法人」，第二十九條規定地方自治應受行政監督，第三十條規定自治監督機關有權解散違憲之民意機關外，其他各條多與憲法規定相同，甚至全同。尤其第二十一條規定省事業機構，不分等次，不定廳處；第二十七條規定縣事業機構，未以縣之等次及需要，設科成設局，似均未切實際。又關於省民大會之組織及選舉，憲法規定「以法律定之」，這「法律」可解釋爲「自治通則」，亦可解釋爲另一組織法選舉法。自治通則草案第四章未規定省民大會之組織及選舉，是則省民大會將陷入無法進行召集組織和選舉的境地，更何從制定省自治法呢？「自治通則」是憲法授權的中央立法，具爲規定省縣民大會制定省倒自治法的程序法，自應將省民大會之組織召集及選舉事項，予以列舉規定，比較通行。</p>
<p>以上所論，係就客觀事實而言，我們希望自治通則成爲一部完備的法典，以盡國家行憲立法之意。地方自治並非一種高不可攀的理論，祇要切合實際就可通行；立法是一種制度的設計，並非莫測高深的技術，祇要周密明朗就可通行。地方自治是憲政國家起碼的政治，旅行地方自治的法律，必須要起碼做到設計上的周密明朗。質諸行政與立法當局，以供參考。</p>

<h3>陳啓天抵濟　視察煤礦　並商運輸事宜</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日電〕經濟部長陳啓天，十一日乘浦濟通車典禮專車來濟，定十三日原車返京。渠於車廂中對記者亦稱：此行主要動機，僞視察淮南，葉東，中興，淄博四煤礦，就近聽取各礦免責人之報告，以推進前此在京召開之全國煤礦增產會議中決定之計劃。關於運煤事宜，亦經與路局及載運指揮所磋商，決定派定專車一列，專供運煤之用。渠稱：只要浦濟段維持正黨運輸狀態，一月後京市外圍冬秀用煤即毫無問題，因根據預計，一月內至少可運煤十五萬噸南下。又稱：改革幣制，可以解決當前經濟困難，改革後可使人民生活及財政收支均安定，惟新幣須以六成現金充作準備，方可保證其信用。至於國營事業等可否充作準備一點，陳稱：困難甚多，且不易僞人民相信。陳氏並就實施棉紗統制辦法發表意見稱：該辦法實施以後，廠商之不滿意及政府執行時所遭遇之困難，胥屬不可避免之事實，但如謂足以置廠商於死地，實乃過甚其辭，渠引證勝利前在後方實施之統制辦法遠較目前僞嚴格，但仍有甚多之紗廠存。在本報記者復以發行大鈔事詢其意見，渠以僞時間尚嫌其過遲，蓋以戰前與戰後物價相較，則現在十萬元大鈔，僅值戰前法幣二元。渠稱：市塲中因發行大鈔而引起之波動狀態，曰經濟心理病。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾堅決要求蘇聯　停止獲取德物資　促莫洛托夫提明確答覆</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十日電〕據每日電訊報外交記者報導解：美政府刻正急需馬　返回華府，馬鄉已建議其政府於十五日返國。該記者預測本週杪外長會議將發生驚人之危機。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電外長會議十日討論提取生產物賠償之問題，又復陷入僵局。馬歇爾乃發表本屆外長會議開始以來最强硬之聲明，要求蘇聯立即提出其具體答覆，指出目前一波三折之拖延政策務須制止，四强茍不能獲此一重大問題成立協議，實爲不容　費而竟浪費時問。但渠又鄭取聲明，美國決不同意以提取生產物供作賠償，作爲統一德國經濟之代價。馬歇爾聲明其立場畢，莫洛托夫即建議散會。此一生產物供作賠償問題之起爭執，發生於討論英國主要建議案之時，英主要建議案有云：「在德國已獲收支平衡之經濟，並償淸佔領強國所墊付之費用以前，不能提取德國之隨時生產物或存倉生產物作爲賠償」。馬歇爾稱，在蘇代表團未獲提取生產物供作賠償之問題，提出明確之答覆以前，所有目前在討論中之各項，如進出口計劃，德出口物所得之支配，佔領費協定，及德經濟之平衡等，均無法明朗。美政府認爲賠償問題，已在波　坦獲得最後解決，美國決不同意以生產供作賠償至計劃。不料事實之演變竟完全相反。英美輸入德西部以維德人生存之糧貪，年達七億美元，而蘇聯自德東部移出之德國資產年亦達五億美元之鉅。東部之德國企業，逐一爲蘇聯之托辣斯所侵佔，此外更有大批德工人被强迫前往蘇聯。此種局勢必須立即矯正，不應久延弗決，否則德國經濟勢將破壞無遺，几使整個歐洲經濟陷於窘境。</p>
<p>馬歇爾　乃提出其決議案，內稱：「自一九四八年1月一日起，除立即得被用以維持德國經濟具有適當經濟價値之金錢及貨物外，任何物不得運出德國。在盟管會採取其他行動，或和約另有規定以前，此一決議當繼續有效。惟對於業已議定供作賠償至工廠機械等，不適用此一決議」。英法外長對馬卿該一決議案，表示尚需考慮。莫洛托夫表示當於討論一般賠償問題時提出答覆。</p>
<p>今日之曾讓係討論基本文件中關於下列諸項之建議：　由德國淸償明國墊付費用；　佔領　；　歐戰結束后外國徵用德企業權益之處置；　外人在德權益受德國法律之管轄；　隨時生產物問題；　解散德獨佔企業。除第六項已　協議外，餘均不獲協議。</p>

<h3>總工會要求未能遂願　羅馬總罷工開始　必要時政府擬使用武力</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十一日電〕羅馬今晨發生廿五年來初次總罷工，此乃左派份子對加斯利政府發動之冬季攻勢。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕英外交部發言人聲明，美陸長羅雅爾昨告美參院撥款委會，聲言由於英美在華盛頓舉行德境佔領費談判之結果，美國今後在兩區之經濟財政事務中，將有控制之權一節，僅係指對於對外貿易之權而言，除此以外之事務，根本未亦華盛頓之談判中談及。發言人並否認倫敦某報所載謂羅雅爾曾表示美國且將控制合併區政治政策之說，據悉華盛頓談判所涉者，除修改佔領費分担之辦法外，僅談及合組進出口機構之事，美國在該一機構中可有大部份控制　，該協定尚待兩國政府正式批准。</p>

<p>緬甸及錫闌，均已與英簽訂條約，規定獨立以後與英國之關係。緬總理奉金諾最近來倫敦簽訂英緬條約時，曾朋白表示，緬甸共和國將繼續與英保持最友好之關係，緬甸憲法已經緬製黨議會草成，規定建立緬甸聯邦設兩院聯邦議會，由議會選舉認統，任命內閣總理。聯邦之每邦，得由邦議會選舉代表參加聯邦議會。錫蘭面積二萬五千方哩，原爲英王治下直轄殖民地，一九四四年索爾勃里勳爵率委員會赴該島調查後，乃有索爾勃里憲法之成立，給予錫蘭以充分之內政自治權。外交國防，仍由英國負責，該島新政府係於今年九月之普選後產生，獨立後將與英互派高級專員。</p>

<h3>今冬無雪？　觀察天文測氣候公有理婆亦有理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今年冬季是否降雪？及何時開始降雪？頗多人加以猜測。徐家匯天文台龍相齊神父以爲本年十月氣候溫暖，根據渠過去每年經騐推斷，今年冬季大槪不致降雪，或降雪期甚爲遲緩。惟據氣象台臺長鄭子政稱；上海歷年降雪最多之時期，爲陽曆正月，十二月及二月較少。目前雖尙未屆年終，而連日陰　密佈，證明沿海一帶濕氣甚濃，加之北方高氣壓正在移動中，預料下星期一二可抵達華中，屆時如濕空氣仍　在沿海上空，遭遇此種寒流，可能立即降雪。近月內高氣壓籠罩下之華北各地均已降雪，日前日本一帶亦有大風雪，且迄猶未停，故謂上海將不致降雪或降雪期遲緩，殆未必成爲事實云。茲將上海氣象台今日天氣豫測誌後：</p>
<p>黃海：晴，至曇，冰凍，輕　或霧，中度西風至北風，中浪。華中：陰，　，冷至曇，中度北風至東風，晨夕有霧。上海：陰，霾，冷至曇，中度北風至東風，晨夕有霧。東海：曇至陰雨，淸勁北風至東北風，台灣海峽風勢强烈。沿海霾和晨霧，巨浪。</p>

<h3>徐交通將恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報開封五日航訊〕商邱至徐州一段因枕木缺乏。修復工程進行稍緩。頃悉：交部已撥加拿大洋松枕木七萬根，刻正由滬陸績運往徐州。轉發工地應用。汴徐交通，　不日即可恢復。又訊：爲保護鐵路，力謀交通安全計，已由開封縣政府，令飭各鄕鎭，趁冬季農暇，於十二月一日起，開始修挖開封杏花營車站至鄭州軍站之鐵路兩旁護路溝渠，幷限於十五日完成此項工程。</p>

<h3>從盆地到平源</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州九日訊〕紹南嶺山脈的餘緖，洞宮山綿亘于閩浙邊境，武夷山盤錯于閩　父界，造成東南沿海山地中突出地帶的福建山區。福州是這個山區中最大的一塊盆地。</p>
<p>我走（其實是飛）出了這個盆地，抖抖身上一些山野的風塵，跨越多山的閩浙邊境，重回到果越平原的上海。行囊甫卸，又踏上錢塘江畔。重作一次杭州的小遊。</p>
<p>那邊是山嶺重疊這裏有坦蕩平原</p>
<p>福建是中國沿海省份中比較多山的區域。閩西北山深谷幽，姑且不提。即作爲山地中盆地之福州，不獨四週丘陵起伏，市區且　「山山」（于山，烏石山，屛山）之勝。唯其多山，地理環境決定了福建人的經濟條件與生活方式。</p>
<p>當我在數千尺高空俯瞰長江三角洲地帶，沿途川渠交錯，湖沼星羅，彌望坦蕩，百里不見山陸，即偶有一丘一陵，亦屬卑小孤　，成爲平原中之點綴品。江南富庶，實受賜於此青腴之平原。福建貧瘠，泰多阻困於山地高原。地勢之於文化，之於經濟，實具有極大之決定作用。</p>
<p>福州杭州皆省會花園都市公園城</p>
<p>福州市區　花草林泉之勝，是以領有花園式都市的雅號。福州的確擁有不少名勝古蹟，福州西湖是唐聿王的故宮，下過一番雕砌工夫，景物幽美，惜年久失修，蔓草浮萍，不無荒蕪之感。以視西子湖，則瞠乎其後。</p>
<p>我這次再度遊湖，雖然是正値冬日肅殺的季節，仍覺得西湖風姿　娜，正是「欲把西湖比西十，淡妝濃抹總相宜」也。而靑山環繞，波光嵐影，相映成絕，令人留連忘返，譽爲全國之公園，殊不爲過。</p>
<p>閩江好比錢塘江福州螃蟹西湖藕</p>
<p>閩省主川閩江，流經福州盆地，而作爲福州交通的大動脈。錢塘江西匯富春江，浦陽江汨汨東流，經杭州注於杭州灣，滋潤了道個公園城。</p>
<p>這次我到杭州，沒有吃到西湖的藕。提起西湖藕，我想起了福州西湖的螃蟹。福州螃蟹味醇油膩，甚爲遊客所嗜食，惟俗謂亂世蟹多，吃多了蟹，却又不禁爲時局作杞憂。</p>
<p>祖遺的錦　河山願大家好生經營</p>
<p>杭州是我國絲織業中心，福州呢？漆器是其特有之技藝品，也是一種可以套取外匯的製成品。</p>
<p>我看到極目千里的平原地帶的種種，我又想到山地乃至盆地的形形色色，她們各有不同，各有特色，不過，這些都是祖宗留下的錦繡山河。且待我們好好地經之營之吧！</p>

<h3>衢州發現「同情會」首領會根壽已補鍋</h3>

<p>台省硏究試騐機構</p>
<h3>簡化調整計劃已作初步擬議</h3>
<p>〔本報台北八日航訊〕台灣二大生產支柱，工礦農林兩公司已由省府　問楊宣誠於月前提出合併並予改組爲企業公司之計劃，當局對此兩省營機構之調整合併，格於業務。人事。產銷。均有困難，已在鄭重考慮中，惟對各硏究機構之併合，則已作初步成議。目前省立硏究試騐機構，有林業爲·農業·水產·糖業·工業·海洋·地質·衛生等，光復後，當局對各硏究機構雖仍維現狀，但格於經費有限，技術人員不足，管理不週，致具有悠久歷史或有相當基礎之機構仍未能圓滑運用，與關係生產機構未能取得密切聯繫，一任其各行其是，好事舖張，而忽視應做工作，以未能取得合理之調整，實際上未能發揮力量。目前當局決定合併者爲糖業試驗所併於資委會與省府合辦之糖業公司，水產試驗所併入水產公司，農業試驗所之嘉我，恒春二種畜試臉所併入畜產公司。平鎭，魚池兩茶試塲併入茶葉公司。頃此間農業界方面透露：對此種機構之簡化調整，固屬必要，但學術與生產機關須有組織之互相合作，有計劃的逐步研討，力避重覆，共謀解決實際問題，庶更能發揮研究效果，實更必要。企業公司以營利爲目的，若出諸商業心理，以營業之興衰而外爲試驗硏究之準備，實爲學術硏究之危機，並將减弱濃重之硏究氣氛，此點似値得當局愼重考慮</p>

<p>新醫與新藥防癆龐兒  B．C．G．李琛　　靑　菌素之後，各國醫學界又被BCG的效力所哄動了；在此我很通俗地把BCG究竟是什麽，作用如何，及其已被證明確實有效的數字報吿一下，希望藉此可使讀者對BCG感到興趣，而有助於吾國的防癆工作。　　BCG並不是新奇的東西。在念多年前已由Calmette氏引用牠到防癆工作上去，不過在近幾年由於細心收集及分析接種BCG所得之結果，才證實了牠確有驚人的防癆力量，因而引起了醫學界普遍的興趣。BCG就是卡爾邁脫——戈林氏桿蔥BacillaeCalmctteGuerin)之英文縮寫，是一種經過十三年的人工培養的癆病菌，以致毒力已被降低，已不能使人生癆病的東西，這好像同鷄鴨經過人們歷代飼養失却了飛翔的能力一樣。　　癆病就是現在所說的結核病，凡人們被結核桿菌感染後，就要生可怕的癆病；但是大部份人，年輕力莊，抵抗力大，雖經感染，可以組織結核菌的蔓延，短期內即可痊愈，不致演成結核病。此項少數結核菌在人體抵抗力控制下，不但無若何危險，且生相當免疫作用；此時如果用一種結核菌之毒素少量注射到患者的皮膚中去，因免疫作用而生選敏反應，在注射處就發生紅腫的現　，這叫做陽性的結核菌素反應，乃爲欲知道人是否已受結核菌感染的簡單方法，如果人體內尙未有結核菌之侵入，即無反應，不發生紅腫，稱謂陰性結核菌素反應。　　這樣利用結核菌素反應就可以把人分爲二大類了，一類是陽性反應的，一類是陰性反應的，一九二四年正月要Heimback氏在挪威的護士學校裏作了一次普遍的結核菌素試驗，在剛入學的護士學生中九〇五人爲陽性反應，二八〇人爲險性反應。在她們三年訓練期間，常然與開放性結核病患者（即散佈結核菌的病人）接觸的機會很多的，結果在她們三年學業完成的時候再撿査，發現原爲陽性反應的學生中僅百分之〇。九患結核病，且無人因結核病而死亡者。在原爲陰性反應的學生中，竟有百分之二二。四患結核病，且有百分之三。六因結核病而死亡者。　　以後Trnell日氏在Sockholm一個紅十字會護士學校裏，又證明在初入學時結核菌素反應爲陽性的四五一個學生中，結果僅百分之〇。二患結核病，而在入學時反應爲陰性的學生中，結果在結核病的達百分之十七。　　其他的例子即接踵而來，皆證明凡對結核菌業懸陰性反應的人，其羅致結核病較之懸陽性反應的人多得多，其比例平均約九比一，並且發現在初期感染後而顯陰性反應者，若再感染結核病，則其病程之進展及死亡，管較迅速。這又可證明大都成人的結核病乃是一種新的傳染，並非由小孩時初期傳染之病灶擴大而來者。而吾人在社會上受傳染的機會，眞是太多了，例如病人吐了一口含有幾千萬結核菌的痰在地上，乾了後，即隨塵埃飛揚，其傳染力竟達一個月以上，所以在某人一旦抵抗力衰退時，隨時都有患結核病的危險。　　利用BCG的接種，可以使對結核菌素顯陰性反應的人變爲陽性反應，因BCG的毒力甚輕，絕對不可能便人致病，但是BCG又確是結核菌的一種，所以人體內即產生相當免疫作用。接種BCG的方法甚多；有用口服的，只百分之二十三成功，今改用皮內注射法，可百分之九十三至九十八成功，由接種BCG所得的陽性反應平均可以持久四至五年，也有在一年後消失者。　　這樣我們再看BCG接種以後的結果如何。　　一九二六年Helmbck氏開始替對結核菌素顯陰性反應而自願接種之護士學生接種BCG，先使與病人隔離六星期，然後再繼續工作。在二八七人接種成功的學生中，結果患結核病者僅百分之二。六，死於結核病者爲百分之〇。二，然其他仍爲陰性反應的學生中，結果有百分之十七。六患結核病，並有百分之一。八因結核病而死亡者，並且證明凡經接種BCG者，不但發病率降低，並且重症肺結核亦减少。　　一九二七至一九四五年間〇slo之抗癆局接種BCG達一二，六〇〇人，後經Dahl及Hertzberg氏之統計，其中患結核病者及因而死亡者與民間一般之發病率及死亡率之比較爲：發生破壞性結核病一比十，非破壞性者少於一比四，死亡者一比五。六　　一九三七至一九四六年間TamesOlsen及KonradBirklaug氏等在Bergen衛生局種BCG約一萬人之中，於一九四六年四月爲止，無人死於結核病者，患結核病者較之普通人民僅九分之一，患非破壞性結核病之比較僅六分之一，而一九四四年該城因結核病死亡者爲每十萬人死七十八人。　　同樣的例子，現在已不勝枚舉，皆足證明BCG有確實可靠之防癆力量，現在的結核病因爲流傳太廣，傳染的機會太多，利用BCG之接種已有如此驚人的效力，如果BCG廣被採用，則日子一久，即可因結核病减少而使傳染之機會亦隨而减少，如此善性循環數十年不斷努力，不難使萬顯之疲病絕跡矣。　　世界上關係BCG的接種，在挪威瑞典及丹麥，已極爲普遍，近年來英美等國，亦正有計劃的大量發動佈種中，很希望在我國亦受到民間普遍的擁護，以利於普遍的推行。醫藥人才下鄕論  花新人　　醫藥人才過於集中都市，眞有點「邊虛中滿」之感。醫藥下鄉　有人提及過，但因困難重重，結果，實踐就不容易。我也認爲這是一個口號。我們的醫藥衛生政策，由民十七年到今天，就患了頭重脚輕的毛病。這病象的構成，却與人才及經濟的分佈有關。中央與省市的衛政表現是如此，省與縣間亦如此。無可諱言，目前趨勢，全國第一流人才專家，均集中於京滬綫，次者省市，至於縣鎭鄕邑，却有人才拂底之嘆。人才集中於京滬錢、其結果，從衛生事業的立塲競，一切醫療設施，都較易推動，而且，所佔的比重也較多。像這樣，大都市就成了畸形的滿榮，而邊地與鄕邑，則呈偏枯。國家的保健事業發展也就被破壞了。再從人事方面說，因人才集中都市，即成了都市人才的充血現象，因此就免不了大魚吃小魚。於是勾心鬥角者。時有　生，縱橫　　者，亦時有所聞。這樣的激烈鬥爭，僅加强了人事上的磨擦，形成了人事上的浪費。同時，因內地鄕邑人才不够，乃感人才貧血，使江湖巫務紅極一時，落伍之無照西醫武斷鄕曲，結果却形成了醫　衛生的極度黑暗與空虛。以上兩種現象，均爲公醫制度及醫藥保健均衡發展的障碳。今日旅行內地人士，大都有此感覺與焦慮。爲什麽會形成這種不良現象呢？第一，在國家政策中，衛生政策沒有被重視；第二，整個的衛生經費渺小得可憐，就像衛生經費就不及中央政府全部支出的百分之零點二；第三，傳統的醫學敎育就是和金元國看齊，醫學畢業生根本對本國的政治，社會，經濟，倫理等太生疏；第四，醫學敎育是一種貴簇敎育，每年舉業有太少，結果形成奇貨自居；第五，我國一般文化敎育低落，對於科學新醫多不瞭解。有這五項因素，醫藥下鄕，就被窒息了，醫藥事業，就不得不在大都市求發展。　　全國第一流的專家爲什麼不肯下鄕？是不是他們不願意下鄕呢？第一個問題，在內地鄕邑沒有硏究的好環境，沒有良好的設施，當然，好一點的人才，就不願去。試問，就目前現狀的各縣衛生院的設施，請一位專家去主持，是否有大才小用之感？第二，經費太少，不够溫飽，以一位受了六年高等敎育的醫生，下鄕去天天愁柴米油鹽，這是否是人才浪費？第三，制度不良，一個鄉邑的衛生工作者，階級不够科員，何况我國的政事，又都是「人存政舉」。人生爲的什麽？大官旣不能做，大事亦無我分，結果，視下鄕爲畏途的醫師，大有人才。當局爲應付起見，　要懂一點新醫皮毛者，就派下鄉，祗要不拆爛汚，即可兩全其美。像道樣，縣衛生制度被破壞，醫撩事業僅有其名，而無其實，有眞才實　的人，誰願意去呢。　　今後應如何矯正這病象呢？我以爲：第一，要糾正目前當局對衛生政策的錯誤觀念，那就是不要徧重于大都市，什麽事都該以縣爲基礎。第二，待遇要提高，不用諱言，到內地下鄕工作者所最感痛苦的，就是待遇微薄，生活過于艱苦，無論在精神或物質方面，縣份都遠遜于大都市。同是技術人員，爲什麽下鄕的人差別倍數的待遇，及技術津貼的計算就有所不同。這種欠公平的待遇，無形的影響到醫藥下鄕工作。所以，我們應該建立同工同酬的原則。第三，應該加强硏究環境及增進臨床該備，使能安心專一的埋頭做下去。第四，若遇有困難時，當局必須設法予以解除，使下鄕工作者不致灰心喪氣。若果當局能重視此原則，集中都市的醫藥人才自會逐漸地外流，更自會逐漸地分佈到各鄕　去。　　我們不要忽略，人人有理想，也有嗜慾。我們知道，理想是抽象的，慾望是現實的，美麗的理想，往往敵不過現實的慾望。攪衛生行政的人，必須瞭解這一點。因此，醫藥下鄉，決不去一個口號，也不是嚴申法令所能見效。在今天這種不公正的待遇，及縣衛生院設備折爛汚的現狀下，醫藥人才齊集在大都市，這是客觀環境所造成的必然現象。在衛生當局　長莫及的政策下，醫藥怎能下鄕？倒是我們注意的一個問題。因此，提出這一個問題，同時也主張保留這一個口號。醫藥新聞  梁俊靑　　　用局部麻醉法割治扁桃泉炎發生意外之原因據一九四六年第八期之奥國雜夜納耳鼻喉科醫學月刋上載，奥國因史布魯克城（Innsbruck）耳鼻喉科醫院曾經因用局部麻醉法割治慢性扁桃腺炎發生意外事件二起。據（H，Hohibrugger警師報吿，其所用局部麻醉之先期準備劑爲黃　根製劑（Scopolamin）及麻黃劑（Ephetonin）與「油科多耳」Eukodal）愛死你種之合併劑，係怡默克藥廠出品，取名爲（Skofedal）。詎料於注射半小時後正在為病人注射拿佛卡因局部麻醉劑時，忽然病者呼吸停止，情形非常危急。後經該醫師施用人工呼吸急救術並爲其注射可拉明强心劑以及刺激呼吸劑Lobein）方始得慶再生。據　爾布魯格氏意見在使用　拿佛卡因之局部麻醉法以前若先勇（Skofedal）注射病者肌肉內作為準備工作，則實爲不智之甚。蓋其危險性甚大足以戕害病者之生命也。吾人諒亦深知，麻黃劑原有减少油科多耳劑毒力之功效，是以在（Skofedal內加有麻黃劑。惟若於注射上述之（Skofedal）後再注射拿佛卡因劑則此拿佛卡因之麻醉作用已將麻黃劑之减少毒力作用對消，而成爲有成脅呼吸神經中樞之麻醉作用矣。且吾人又知，實　劑往往有直接或則簡接（即反射性作用）麻醉呼吸神經中樞之作用，同時其部主動脈轉灣處（Carotissinus）往往亦可以因此發生反射性之停止呼吸作用也。根據上述之理由，是以在割治頸部病症時使用拿佛卡因局部麻醉之前，萬勿使類似（Skotedal）之準備藥，以免發生任何意外事件。　　　用腰脊髓　醉法後所產生之不良副作用　　據本年份出版第九十五册「斯坎特那維亞」外科學報上戰史密斯博士（瑞典烏梅亞市立醫院外科部部長）報吿近年來使用腰靑髓麻醉法之經驗及其利弊情形。據稱如以麻醉劑如（Tropacocain　Novocain　StovainAlypin）之類注射於動物之　髓腔內，則可發生暫時性或永久性之脊髓病變，又其脊髓膜亦有同樣病變，且有神經方面之症象發生。惟其神經末梢及神經結節則毫無變化。若以Tropacocain　Novocain　PantocainTutocain　Stovain及Percain）之類麻醉劑注射於人類之背脊髓腔內亦可有上述類似之病變。史氏會以此事函詢各方意見並曾於一年內微集二萬三千例以上之背脊髓麻醉情形彼於一九四三至一九四五年內共會　得使用腰脊雖麻醉法後發生嚴重病變之症例六起。此種病變大槪是麻　劑之化學作用毒害於脊髓之故。其病變係於使用麻醉獨後不久即行發生，有於數日內發生者，有隔　星期後者，有隔三月後者，惟其症象則大抵相同，其病變症象如下：四肢有異樣感覺如蟻爬之類，全身疼痛，　攣，知覺消失，麻木不仁，膀胱要直腸麻痺以及其他障碍等等。此外如性器管及性感方面之障　以及血液循環障碳，汗腺分泌失常以及四肢之自行潰爛等等皆有發生。此種病變之預後情形非常不良。除有少數病人可以自己完全痊愈外其中有少數病者經醫治後亦可恢復健康，惟其所遺留之病變（例如手足麻痺或陽萎之類（則永遠不能痊愈。其他之病人則因此死亡。目下尙無預防此種病變之方法。至於治療此種病變之方法不外爲治標辦　。例如按摩，電遼，水浴遼之類而已。史密斯博士以爲此種意外之病變雖則非常少數（僅爲全數腰脊髓麻醉率之份一），但不可不知，且於使用腰脊髓麻醉法時亦應　貨爲佳云。醫藥的起源是愛  王爵榮　　診餘漫談之一　　在火車上非常無聊的時候，看到一張武陵舊報，有一位梁甫吟先生寫了一小段有關醫藥的文字，樑題是「醫藥的起源是愛」，雖然寫得很短，但是字裏行間，充滿樂對醫藥界的熟情和企望，那時我正在爲醫事糾紛問題，奔走京杭，做調査統計，看到了這篇文字，無限的感慨，湧上了我的心頭，回到家中，翻出了雨果先生的孤星淚，重溫了一遍上面由一段，將醫師和牧師相提並論，說：　　「醫師的門，永不該關上，牧師的門，也應該一直開着，何必需用那鐵拴閂鎖呢？」　　的確，醫師的職業，是神聖的，是崇高的，袛有牧師才配合他相提並論！　　因爲是神聖的所以每一位醫師，應該認識他的責任的重大，戰戰競競如臨深淵，如覆薄冰，擔負起這偉大的使命！　　因爲是崇高的，所以社會人士應該對他敬愛，信任，讓他能安心順利的完成他的任務！雖然有時他救不樂病人的生命，只要他盡了他的責任，我們對他應該是「感激」，不是「仇恨」，因爲醫師到底不是上帝！（未完）</p>

<p>自由談無賴哲學  季庸　　有一個時期，上海人到外面買菜都要用帶有鐵絲籠的籃子，後來就發明了綫織的網袋。原因是有些　三專門搶了小菜，先在上面抹上一把鼻涕或粘痰，於是你雖追及，也不屑於要了，他就揚長而去，對於大餅油條一類點心，執行此法尤力。　　其實這是古已有之，我記得賢如藺相如，就用這方法打消了秦皇帝的野心，你要　嗎？我砸了他也不能給你！這一派發展成爲後來的堅壁淸野之術，乃是最正當且最光榮的使用方式。　　還有一派就是傳統的三不和之一——前後任，大小妻……等所常用的。古時有舊令尹之政吿之新令尹的「美談」，可見不吿是當然，吿乃是例外，在今人認爲是瘟生的。　　先是不吿還不要緊，繼之而來的是拆爛汚。中國人的議論裏是把邱吉爾翩然退出唐寗街，一淸如水的交代給艾德禮當作好的政治風度，可是在中國人的心坎裏却認爲是最不漂亮的手法，憑這時候不撈他一下，更待何時！　　自古豪傑本來常屬之比　三高一等的流氓，我們不能說流氓就壞，那是因爲念書念呆了。吳梅村，錢收齋，李煜，李　都是讀書太多才壞了，這是盡人皆知的；而劉邦對於太公之被烹，正巧妙的應用了　三戰術，於是置之死地而後生。　　爭天下時這種幹法自然很够意思，世家子出身的項少爺就吃不消；可是若無限制的用到天下已平之後，那就非糟不行。中國人的競爭常是以破壞別人爲自己的建設，至少，我若不能建設，你也不用顯神通，俗語謂之「看顏色」云云，這顏色的　，其實還是老百姓吃了。我所知道的傅作義  卜眠　　有一位太太曾經說：「傅宜生（作義）的婆婆最多。」這句話聽來頗使人好笑，但仔細想想，也確實有道理。因爲傅的系統複雜，當過他上司的人太多，難以應付。可是有一句俗語：「多年的道兒走成河，多年的媳婦熬成婆。」這話委實不錯，他過去的老婆婆們，大多已年老力疲，日暮途窮，現在，他這個新媳婦煎熬了多少年，當然熬出頭做婆婆了。　　所以，蔣主席蒞平後決定統一華北軍事指揮，傅氏立刻被任爲華北剿匪總司令，張家口的老百姓聞訊，極爲興奮，可見傅宜生是何等地獲得了民衆的擁戴。　　其實，「傅宜生」三個字呌得道樣響亮，也不是一天了，遠在廿年前，他率部駐守大同，以寡敵衆，苦守三個月，因而由「孤軍守涿」，一舉成名了。從此他就變成了新聞人物，在歷史上寫下了輝煌的一頁，從廿五年十月百靈廟大捷到去年雙十節收復張家口，這整整十年的時間，他一直在風沙裏馳騁着，始終任勞任怨坐鎭在綏遠！　　傅氏生平有兩件得意傑作，其一是對公共秩序的管理。他主張任何集會與娛樂塲所，男女必須「分道揚鑣」，在他的割區內，只要你走進公共塲所的大門，制服同志老早嚷着：」先生這邊去，太太小姐請那邊！」進去以後，男的坐在一邊，女的坐在一邊，一左一右，當中的走道變成一條鴻溝，劃分得淸淸楚楚，假使一對情侶或者夫婦，走了進去，就不免會有咫尺天涯之感了。　　其二是歡迎新聞記者。凡是去訪問的記者，只要卡片遞進去，他總會接見，而從不「擋駕」，有一次，幾個記者去看他，偏偏遇到一位新來的副官，他不懂傅主席的脾氣，把這幾位記者統統不客氣地打發了，他以爲這種做法可以邀功，却想不到常他把卡片拿進去回報傅氏說：「記者已經給打發走了」時，傳氏大爲震怒，痛駡他沒有頭腦，怎麽隨隨便便得罪了新聞記者。這個副官祇有「是！是！」退出，而從此以後，訪問傳氏的記者，再不　　傅宜生雖然已是五十二歲了，但他依舊精神奕奕，談話時談鋒很健，措辭有力，在保定出身的將領中，他是升得最快的一個，也是一直沒有離開過　位的唯一好將領了。騙瞎子  孫約翰　　吟餘贅語載：一瞎子行於街，有某生因要事而急奔，與瞎子相撞，瞎子被撞，踏地不起。某生見事窘，乃假作不得已而大呼曰：「予爲瞎子，豈爾亦　子耶？」瞎子聞聲，怨氣全消，自慰慰人曰：「嗚呼！彼此皆瞎，彼此皆瞎！」某生始佯作咕　，揚長而去。由是觀之，得最於人，務先掩己非，然後再論人之過，人或能原宥之。方便  吉爾　　我國現在通用的許多語　中，滲雜着釋典的字句頗多，不過意義大都已經轉變，「方便」其一也。因爲用得已成爛然，所以習焉不察，眞能行「方便」的倒又如鳳毛麟角了。　　據說方者法也，「方便」者法之便宜也。又據說，釋主喬達摩悉達多在歷刧修通的時候，曾經因「方便」而殺過人。原來那時他是一位船主，率領了六百個商人去漂海經商，不知如何一來，他忽然心血來潮，獲知其中有一位起了不良之意，要殺盡同船的人。於是他說又不是——說了，其他的人必起　恨殺心；不說又不是——不說，連他六百人全將遭戮。於是他就行「方便」了，他先殺了那個起意不良的商人。據說是預備將罪孽一身肩負的。　　不過，這樣一來，「方便」二字却很難說了。必須有敏銳的判斷力，方能不生亂子。因爲旣然方便是法之便宜，那末街頭乞丐雖聲嘶力竭喊破喉嚨要求一點「方便」，儘可相應不理。這於我有何便宜呢？一切呼　，祈求，請願之來，亦全須視我方法之便不便而定取捨；而一切歪曲，囤積，貪汚，冷漠，亦正無妨視我方法之便宜而行之。於是無往而不便，不必擇手段；一切罪惡均可假「方便」而行，則又豈初創「方便」者之始料所及哉！　　所以儒書說，經者法之常也。權只能行之於一時，規矩繩墨，可以中人而不失。然而死守規矩而不知變通，亦何足道哉，最好的應用「方便」，我看還是「與人方便，自己方便」。打倒摜砲！  雷紅　　兒童玩具中有一種摜砲，不知是那一個發明，行之已久，其實是對於生命安全，兩有損害的一種玩物。戰前新年中，時時在馬路中可以遇到一批頑皮兒童，在馬路上大放其摜砲，往往趁一個妙齡女子走過的時候在她背後冷不防備，猛然地　的一響，確實要使跑過去的女人心瞻　裂。　　以後在戰事最緊張張時期，摜砲曾經停止過一個時期，爲的是戒嚴。勝利以後，摜砲又復活了。美國水兵像中國頑童一樣，特別歡喜這個玩意兒。而且也好在人背後來個「響不見」。我有一次深夜歸來，曾經被火星濺到耳畔，受到的不是驚嚇，倒是一些小小的疼痛。　　後來報紙上登載過一段消息，新城陽廟有一家販賣慣砲的店家，有一大串摜砲因不愼而爆炸，竟致引起大火，店主自焚其身，還連帶害了鄕鄰選殃。那時我家三層樓上住有一個失業靑年，看見摜砲生意興隆，也在三層樓的房間中設起「工塲」來，專製摜砲，最忙的時候，「工塲」裏有十個女工在包製摜砲。某一晚只聽見樓上轟然一聲，接着而來的是濃重的火藥味，但聽樓上脚步零亂，忙些不知什麽。結果査明是火藥爆炸，僥倖沒有　成火災，但驚嚇是受到的了。後來我們就以這個理由請那家「摜砲」作搬家。　　由於種種過去事實，不但是我個人見了摜砲痛心疾首，便是一般的與論對之亦並無好感。兒童玩具中之應該將摜砲捨棄，理由不止是一個。就是說提倡尙武精神吧，不但是這個渴求和平的世界不需要再用火藥來刺激，即以摜砲的本身來講，對於兒童們能否　注軍事當職，還相差得太遠。　　新近在星期六晚郵上看到一篇文字，說的是一個製造泡泡糖大王的成功史。著者說因爲泡泡糖的盛行，竟使着干家長們感到頭痛與發狂，因爲孩子們太歡喜這種玩意兒：東也「拍」，西也「拍」，有時濺到別人面上，一塊黏性的濕漉漉的東西，令人生厭。我覺得泡泡糖的令人頭痛與發狂，還屬其次，如其說摜砲，才是眞正可厭的東西——不但是可厭，而且是影響到社會安寗的一件危險品！　　九日本報上載有一段電訊，「停　北站往南京之第十次車在未開行前，其中八九三號三等車箱一節，突然發生爆炸，轟然一聲，濃烟四播，火藥味瀰漫全車，旅客莫名眞相，紛紛越窗笨逃：經駐站憲警澈查，乃知一滿意「摜砲」之旅行袋爆炸，一塲虛驚始吿平息：」爆炸時車窗打破，旅客受損傷，遺失衣帽行李，不知凡幾。　　由於以往的經驗，這種徒然擾亂社會的玩物，應請社會局立即禁止其製造與發賣。陽歷新年快要到了，這種「應時」的玩具如有發現，警局必須予以沒收。我敢說，兒童們損失了道一種玩具。決不致對於兒童之成長及教育有什麽些微影響！「原子寡婦」  新夢　　美國是離婚案件最多之國，其中多半由女性提出，各有理由。在我們看來，有的案件，所提出的離婚理由，有些奇特。最近有斯却爾克夫人者，向她的丈夫提出離婚要求，自稱「原子寡婦」，她的丈夫斯却爾克，爲著名的原子研究家，平日所有精力，都用在研究原子上面，其他一切，什麽都不管的。因此，他夫人所提的離婚理由中，說她的丈夫拒絕帶她到外面去從事社交，因爲這些是無益於硏究原子的，結果使她爲原子而感到寂寞之苦，委實巳成了一個「原子寡婦」了。聯話  王百里　　香光杭州冷泉亭聯云：「泉是幾時冷起？峯從何處飛來」？其筆調輕快，幾不着紙。戊戌政變，六君子（譚嗣同，林旭，楊銳，劉光第，楊深秀，康廣仁）被殺，康南海有長聯　之云：「龍比精忠，岳于慘戮，昔賢猶是，君復何尤，魂魄若然靈，好同正學先生，矢口問成王安在？漢朝黨錮，唐代淸流，振古如斯，今乃再見，海疆方多事，須効子胥瀕死，留眸着越寇飛來！「一氣呵成，毫無牽强。此二聯未句同用「飛來」二字，各有千秋。阮元在翰苑時，帝賜　，命以其姓名屬對，阮應日：「伊尹」。非惟字形近似，聲亦近似，可謂工整之至。余少時看包公案小說，記內有一聯云：「移椅倚桐同玩丹，點燈登閣各攻書」，眞魄爲絕對。風景愛  霜廬　　如果要說是附庸風雅呢，那也沒話說，但我一向愛好一點風景，却是事實。　　我是愛好「勻稱」的人，旣討厭僞君子，亦痛恨眞小人。大紅大綠固然也有好處，但自己穿衣服，私衷還是歡喜藏靑和藍灰。這是心靈上一種貼服的感覺，正像自來水筆少了一個別頭，固然無礙於書寫，但總不覺得暢快一樣。風景便是自然的「勻稱」。人物亦然，可喜的人便是靈和肉的「勻稱」，但在這裘，男女性都有一點分別，男子之可喜，「勻稱」着重前者，女子之可喜，則往往以後者爲重。　　我不曾出過遠門。秋之玄武湖的蕭疏的美，初夏的西湖之明艷，都能心領神會。但於名山大川，却也心響往之。如果有機，當然也要造訪一會的。但在目前，縱然只能在紙上領略一點，也覺得够了，蓋惟恐實物之不如騷人墨客寫得那麼十全十美。　　所苦的是日處市鑒，不要說化不起旅行的錢，便是這一份時問，也難得抽出來，做人做到如此天地。大槪要有時代的痛感吧？可是這有什麽辦法呢？不得已而來其次，那未袛能有時去看看書盡，　讀遊記，聊止湖山之渴。插一瓶菊花，姑且當它可以悠然而見南山，吃一盆　魚，居然可以想像到「桃花流水鱖魚肥」的潐家風光，這樣的畫餅充飢，有時自己也覺得可笑，只是積習難返，時而有這樣的白日之　。　　其實所謂風景，並不定在湖山勝景。你如能抓住霎那的時機，一角的景色，便很可心曠神怡，不必求全——也不可求全。　　譬如西湖是美的，但你也許只喜西泠橋畔的一段秀麗，而我是神往於靈隱道上的田園之勝的。任何一處的風景，我們只能取其一鱗半爪，再藝術一點的說法，只能在某一種塲合，這一鱗半爪才够得眞正美的條件。更藝術一點的說法，也要身臨其境者的心境來配合，身臨其境者的氣度來領會。淚眼看花，花必不盡姸極媚。雨後櫻桃，自然更見精神。如果我的說法並沒有錯，那末陋巷中僅可飽言眼福，　台也偶然會發見美色。　　有一次，在朋友家賭罷回來，東方已露出最初的曙色。衖堂要的石子路被夜來的霧氣浸潤了，有點難以下脚，這時傳出一陣陣遠處的鷄聲，我忽然想到這便是古人「鷄聲茅店月，人跡板橋霜」的情調了，我恍恍忽忽地回到了唐宋的世界。眼前的一排竹籬，更增加了這古樸的情調。　　又有一次在傍晚的愚園路上，洋樓前的一帶　垣，已有點頹敗了，牆壁上的石灰已黯然無色，幾樹埀楊，蕭索得有點發抖，遠天正散着綺麗的晚霞，我忽有所感，所謂「西風殘照，漢家陸闕」，大概就是這副樣子。祇要你有此心情，「西風殘照，漢家陵闕」的光景，便不定在函關或是咸陽體味的。　　但這只是一種以想像補事物之不足的辦法，也是一種沒奈何中的極法，「祗可自怡悅」，而並不希望人人如此的。有良心一點地說，我們還是希望人人能在日理千百億萬和張三李四之餘，去領略一點自然之趣，因爲我們還是從自然來的。只是世亂，年荒，小民若吾輩，大概祗能在鈔票的背面領略天壇風景罷了。　　芥川能之介曾神往於唐人「窗前流水枕前書」的境界，而慨嘆於今人之沒有古人那麼福氣，於我亦然。如能放開一點意氣，而解脫於妻孥子累的話，則我亦欲放棹於江湖了。苗頭  阿水　　一般人認爲苗族絕無所謂社會組織，其實大錯特錯。他們不但有組織，而且還是極民主化的。他們均係自耕農，並無奴隸階級存在。他們一處地方的領袖，稱爲「苗頭」，乃是由本地苗人大家推定的。嚴明  百里　　部屬愚弄長官，或初懷敬畏而日久玩生，均所常見，但部屬初次向主宮所播弄的，都是屬於試探性質，不是天生就的劣根性。如遇主官昏庸，此輩便以一而再而三，乘機竊權，變本加厲，結果弄得尾大不掉，雖欲痛下改革，但積習已成，終難朝夕所能見功；假使主官嚴明，當其疏忽初起之時，即以斬釘截鐵的手段予以打擊，究竟人都是理性的動物，誰敢爲非做歹！這裏有一段樊　山對房需楊先甲的批示，說得很透澈，批云：「久則生玩，人情類然，本縣初到任時，房差各懷敬畏，今見本縣相待和平，遂爾疲玩嘗試，殊不知官與房差，朝夕相見，斷無日日生氣之理。公事下得去，自然待得好；若怠玩誤公，有心朦混，本縣執法嚴明，豈能輕恕！廉恥須要自愛，髮膚須要自惜，職分須要自盡，飯碗切勿自砸！前日軍糧比較，短至千數百石之多，而兵書袁學愼，將比期挪移一月，爾等抬頭，試看本縣豈可欺者耶！枷而未打，已屬格外從輕，欠糧升斗未補，而又遽　開　，爾等自問公事上過得去否？……」部屬遇到這樣主官，縱欲出「槍花」，亦無所施其技了。總之，部屬是替主官辦事，不是主官給部屬驅使，主官的舵如果把得正，部屬斷斷不會將你的船開道石頭上去的。「自由」談  少榮　　那些否認別人自由的人，他們本身就不應該得到自由。——林肯　　我不知道別人所採用的方法是什麽？至於我：不自由，毋寗死！——配屈律克。亨利　　　光綫的對於眼睛，空氣的對於肺，——愛情的對於心靈，——與自由的對於人類靈魂，是有同　的作用。——英甘沙爾逍遙花  陳慎言　　第三章　台上與台下　　渚齊給她如此一說，袛好答應。绮紈便呌小王媽拿了三張　票　給　齊，　齊道：「你不是請我太太麼，有兩張票就夠了。」绮紈道：「不是還有那位大學畢業令表妹碼？」　齊聽了，祗好笑着連稱謝。綺紈道：「我希呈你今晚早點去，我在後台等你。」渚齋見她如此招呼，心裏甚是高興，所美中不足的，就是家裏那位太太實在古板，去不去還說不定。後來一想，綺紈給我三張票，我央求雲卿邀我太太同去，她爲面子上關係，不能不去，當下對着綺紈點點頭，正要誇獎她昨晚「人面桃花」唱得好，還沒說出口，綺紈看一看腕上手錢，先說道：「徐先生，你很忙，累你走一趟，實在對不住，我們今晚上去開明戲院再見吧。」渚　不便再坐，說道：「你昨晚辛苦，多休息一會。再見，再見。」辭了出去，剛離開街門幾步，突見一輛黑色汽車，由胡同口開進，直駛到綺紈住宅門前停住。渚齋站在廣塲柳樹下，遠遠地回頭望着，只見一個穿藏靑呢西服的中年男子，鼻上架一副眼鏡，走下車來，走近那小小綠油門時，門內似聽到汽車聲音，門早開了。那男子搖着手裏手杖，一直走了進去。渚齋心想這人，莫非就是他們所說的林局長罷？又想剛才和綺紈說話時，她祗匆匆說了幾句話，似乎心神不定的樣子。想到這　，不田搖一搖頭，僱一輛街車，一直趕到多福巷。　　雲唧一見他，迎着笑道：「我知道你今天會來，想你總須到晚上才來，却沒想到你現在就有工夫，我的還沒預備呢。」渚齊很忸道：「我不是來焼菜，是約你去聽戲的。」雲鄕不由一　道；「擬還約我看　　的戲碼？我不去。」消齊道：「今天因爲銀行裏同仁又送我三張票，我想約你和我太太同去，今天綺紈演王堂春，是她拿手奸戲。」愛卿見渚齋今晚肯同他太太出去看戲，出於意外，問道：「眞的嗎？」渚齋道：「是的。」雲卿道：「你陪表嫂去好了！」渚齋道：「我邀她不過應個景兒，她什麽戲文也不懂，你最近不是硏究王堂春嗎？今晚綺紈演的就是玉堂春，是由朱關芬親傳，完全學梅派，我們大可硏究硏究。」雲卿道：「那也好，我今晚上你家裏找表嫂去。」渚齋道：「請早點去，我自己燒幾碗菜請你。」雲卿道：「那可不必！」　　渚　約好雲卿，忙忙出去，在街上帶些角肉菜蔬回家，吿訴太太。「今晚雲卿會來約你去開明戲院看戲，我們預備　碗菜請她。」渚齋太太高鳳笙，原是一位地地道道勤儉持家，克盡婦道的舊式太太，一聽章雲卿要來，忙着帮同渚齊親自動手，弄了幾碗菜。到了五點鐘，雲卿來時，一切都預備好了。雲卿見鳳　頭卜裏着，白綳帶，　問道：「表嫂，你頭上爲什麽裏上綳布？」鳳　適：「不要緊的，我因爲一頭上長了黃水瘡，醫治好久，總是不好，醫生呌我把頭髮全剃了，敷上藥，好得快，現在都結痂了。」社會服務豫省災情慘重電請本報　籌募款物撥充冬令救濟　盼河南同鄕及熱心人士紛起募以惠災黎　　〔河南省政府代電〕申報館公鑒：案准本省冬令救濟委員會主任委員劉茂恩，副主任委員馬傑李鴻音等代電開：査豫省不幸，連年災　，自抗戰迄今，天災人禍，紛至沓來，無災不備，無災不重，光復以還，共匪到處竄擾，於今益亟，人民四處流徙，全省幾無凈土。加以本年麥秋　收，平均不及三成，災情更形嚴重，刻已隆冬，春荒瞬至，冰天雪地，肌寒交迫，如不廣謀救濟，勢必俄李在途。雖經中央撥款施振，無如杯水車薪，救濟難周。本會爲適應季節需要，特舉辦冬令救濟，全力　謀，期稍補救，請電各省市河南同鄕會及各大報館，代爲籌募款物，並希早日惠賜，以濟眉燃等由到府，素仰貴報熱心公益，飢溺爲懷，用特電請査照，本以往之協助，代爲募捐，並希早日賜下，以惠災黎，是爲至盼。捐款報告　　冬令救濟捐款　　上海監獄第二糊盒工塲全體工犯十月份所得賞與金移充難民捐一百十一萬七千五百九十元，犬陸橡皮印刷廠全體同人捐一日所得洋七十四萬六千五百元，以上共收一百八十六萬四千零九十元難童敎養所　　又靑年軍二〇二師二旅六團三營八連交來賊贓十四萬四千元捐助　河涇雜意敎養院，請該院携正式收據到館領取。謮者信箱　　留三人君鑒：尊恙應以心理治療爲主，藥物爲輔。淸心寡慾，鍜鍊身體，爲最有效之辦法。各種成　，萬　　服，　　　醫治，並請參閱　曹三人　函。　　馬可信君鑒：　此係消化不良，食物在胃屬內未能充份消化吸收，而起酸酵腐敗所致。　此係輕瀉劑。徵求小空地　　茲有靑年數人，爲鑛鍊體魄，擬徵求鄰近東浦石路之私人花園或小空地，每晨出借一至二小時，如有熱心人士樂助其成者，請函本欄轉洽。　　圖樣招領　本報讀者戴定甫君於八日下午二時三刻行經靜安寺路大華電影院門首，拾得大都會戲院門面設計圖一捲，共計四張，此項圖樣，現存本欄，盼失主見報後，即來領取。</p>

<h3>Through Train Service on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's Pukou-Jinan Section Restored; Commemorative Ceremony Held This Morning; Express Train Service to be Added from New Year's Day</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] Since the victory, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's Pukou-Jinan section, this major artery connecting the North and South, was successfully restored to traffic for the first time on the 11th. The first special train, which departed from Pukou at 4:00 PM on the 10th, slowly entered Jinan Station at 5:15 PM on the 11th amidst the melodious sounds of military music and the presence of over 300 representatives from all sectors of Jinan. The people of Jinan, filled with joy and excitement, welcomed this epoch-making event with the most fervent emotions. Minister Chen Qitian, Director Sa Fujun, and Chinese and foreign colleagues, who had traveled from afar from Beijing and Shanghai, were greeted with heartfelt welcomes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Jinan-Yanzhou section's 77/78 mixed train departed south for the first time at 6:00 AM on the 11th. The third-class ticket price was 112,000 yuan. It arrived on time at 6:50 PM. Today, the number of passengers boarding in Jinan was extremely crowded. Over 300 people were left behind due to the lack of seats.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] To commemorate the restoration of traffic on the Pukou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the railway bureau hosted over 300 representatives from all sectors of Jinan and the press at 8:30 AM on the 11th. They departed from Jinan Station on a special train. At 10:30 AM, the train arrived at the 384-kilometer, 300-meter mark between Zhangxia in Tai'an. Everyone disembarked and took photos at the connection point. The special train continued south and arrived at Wande at 12:40 PM. After a ten-minute rest, it returned to Jinan City, arriving safely at 5:00 PM. Reporters in the carriages observed that local militia were intensifying their training and regular troops were being strengthened, ensuring safety everywhere. Furthermore, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration has scheduled a commemorative ceremony for the reopening of traffic at 9:00 AM on the 12th. Representatives from Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Chinese and foreign reporters, will be its honored guests. At their request, the railway bureau has rescheduled their return south on the original train to the 14th, allowing them to fully appreciate the scenic spots and historical sites in the area. The bureau has also decided to add an ordinary express train between Jinan and Xuzhou starting on the 21st and an express train between Jinan and Pukou starting on New Year's Day. It also plans to establish through transport with the Beijing-Shanghai line, which should facilitate smoother North-South transportation from now on.</p>
<p>Note: The Tianjin-Pukou Railway runs vertically across the North and South, connecting four provinces, a major artery stretching 1,009 kilometers. It was disrupted and interrupted by the Communist bandits for as long as 25 months. This spring, the National Army in Shandong Province quickly advanced, and various areas in southern Shandong were successively recovered. Repair work began immediately, and after three periods of danger and difficulty, the Jinan-Pukou section was finally fully repaired and officially opened to traffic. The Jinan-Pukou section is 658 kilometers long, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the entire Tianjin-Pukou line, and the damage was extremely serious.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Normal Traffic Still Requires Continued Effort; Mr. Chen Shungeng Hopes for Military Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] Chen Shungeng, Director of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau, speaking specifically to our reporter during the Pukou-Jinan traffic restoration ceremony, stated: Although the Pukou-Jinan section has been opened to traffic, due to the rudimentary nature of the current road construction and the inadequate security forces along the route, maintaining normal traffic still requires our continued efforts. He sincerely hopes for the assistance of the military. The railway bureau has planned to rush repairs on the section from Shilipu southeast of Jinan to Zhangdian and the Zhangbo branch line, with a total length of 123 kilometers. The roadbed is currently being filled. The estimated cost of 100 million yuan has also been submitted by the Ministry of Communications to the Executive Yuan for approval. Mr. Chen also said: From Jinan</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] Sa Fujun, Director of the Ministry of Communications, inspected the conditions along the way on the special train for the Pukou-Jinan section's traffic restoration ceremony. He expressed satisfaction with the rush repair work. He spent the entire day sitting in the last passenger car of the train, paying close attention to the tracks, bridges, and the situation on both sides. Mr. Sa expressed great emotion regarding the enormous cost of the rush repair work, stating: The transportation authorities hope that the revenue from railway traffic can maintain expenditures, which is already not easy, let alone the rush repair costs. He stated: Vice Minister Ling Hongxun recently returned from an inspection in Europe. Railway freight rates in Western European countries are not as fast as commodity prices, but they are not far apart. In England, the commodity price index rose by 80%, and freight rates rose by 55%. In Belgium, commodity prices rose by 300%, and freight rates rose by 220%. In Italy, commodity prices rose by 2,000%, and freight rates rose by 900%. In Switzerland, commodity prices rose by 60%, and freight rates rose by 50%. In contrast, freight rates in our country have increased 10,000 times compared to before the war, while commodity prices have increased 100,000 times. The transportation authorities hope that the increase in freight rates will only reach two-thirds of the increase in commodity prices, which can maintain the expenditures of various routes.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Revises and Supplements Relevant Financial Laws; To be Implemented After Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] In order to prevent speculation and illegal activities by financial institutions in various regions and to stabilize the market, the Ministry of Finance has made necessary revisions and supplements to the "Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Operations" and the Banking Law, etc., in light of the current reality. This is to strengthen credit control and strictly regulate the operations of various banks, serving as a reference for the four regional financial management bureaus in the future when performing their duties.

<h3>Imported Goods Such as Cotton, Rice, and Coal Will be Settled at Market Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] According to the new foreign exchange control regulations of August this year, imported materials such as cotton, rice, wheat, flour, coal, and coke were allowed to be settled at official rates.

<h3>Bank Lending Will Continue to be Strictly Enforced</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Since receiving instructions to suspend loans from national banks and bureaus, large-scale loans have been stopped, and even loans below 200 million yuan and export packing loans have been completely suspended. This can be described as extremely strict. The Joint Administration and other agencies are now taking advantage of this suspension to strengthen the review of past lending policies. At the same time, they are closely monitoring the market's reaction after the suspension in order to serve as a reference for future lending. It is still difficult to say when lending will resume and what the principles will be. However, it is believed that when lending resumes in the future, enforcement will still be extremely strict, with emphasis on loans related to national policy and industries essential to people's livelihoods. The Joint Administration's board of directors and the subcommittee review meeting have been suspended since the suspension of lending. The board of directors is expected to reopen next week, at which time there will be important discussions. Furthermore, regarding this suspension of lending, those who have already decided to lend and have already lent a portion will continue to lend, while those who have decided to lend but have not yet lent will stop lending.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Australian Minister Dr. Kobern returned to Nanjing from the Philippines via Shanghai on the 11th. He advocated for an early peace conference with Japan. Dr. Kobern stated that Japan's important position in the North Pacific and its industrial strength are far greater than those possessed by other Eastern countries.

Representatives from the National Resources Commission, the Ministry of Education, and other relevant agencies, numbering more than a dozen, attended.

The second was the issue of import permits for reparations. This point is currently being discussed by the Allocation and Transportation Committee and the Import Control Committee. The former initially believed that import permits were not required for the import of Japanese reparations.

<h3>Liu Mengchun and Others Fly to Dihua; Zhang Zhizhong's Reply to Ahmatjan's Letter Has Been Taken Along; Burhan Believes Xinjiang's Future is Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Zhang Zhizhong's reply to the four demands of Ahmatjan of Yining has been handed over to Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Northwest Headquarters, and others to take to Xinjiang. Liu, along with Liu Zherong, a special commissioner from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others, left Beijing by plane on the morning of the 11th for Xi'an, then on to Dihua. The contents of Zhang's letter to Xinjiang are kept strictly secret from the outside world. This reporter visited Government Committee member Burhan to inquire about the contents of this reply and the future prospects of the Xinjiang issue. Burhan refused to disclose the contents of the reply and did not make any further comments, but repeatedly emphasized that his view of Xinjiang has always been optimistic. As for the four conditions of the Yining side, it can almost be said that every condition is what the government hopes to achieve. As for the issue of replacing Masud Sabri, Burhan stated: The General Rules on Provincial and County Autonomy have been approved by a regular meeting of the Executive Yuan, and the National Assembly is about to be convened. Constitutional government is about to begin, and the national general election will also begin. Xinjiang will not be an exception. At the same time, due to factual needs, it can be brought forward, and it may be held as early as next spring. Therefore, the date for the election of a provincial governor is near, and the issue of removing Masud can be said to be no longer a problem. Burhan's remarks clearly revealed the government's attitude towards handling the Xinjiang issue, which also means that although the various demands for the removal of Masud may not be fulfilled, with the election imminent, the leadership of the new province will not be difficult to change immediately. Subsequently, when the reporter asked whether Burhan would return to Xinjiang to serve after the dissolution of the National Government Committee following the implementation of the constitution, Burhan did not give a direct answer, only smiling and saying: "Possibly." But he firmly stated that he would not participate in the election for the new provincial governor. Furthermore, Burhan's son passed away in Dihua on the 5th of this month. Burhan is feeling deeply saddened. Burhan's son was 21 years old and was the Director of the Uyghur-language Data Room of the Xinjiang Daily.

<p>Editorial</p>
<p>Discussion on the Draft General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy</p>
<p>Amidst the government's active preparations for constitutional governance, the Ministry of Interior, upon instruction from the Executive Yuan, drafted the "General Rules for Provincial (City) and County Autonomy." After review and amendment by the Executive Yuan, it was approved at the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting on the 9th of this month and submitted to the National Government for referral to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The draft consists of five chapters and thirty-four articles. This bill serves as the standard for implementing local self-government. After the implementation of the Constitution, the provincial (city) and county people's representative assemblies will formulate provincial (city) and county self-government laws, necessarily based on this parent body. This is a major event in the history of local self-government development in our country. As the draft is made public for national discussion, we would like to offer a comprehensive discussion based on our observations.</p>
<p>The "General Rules for Provincial (City) and County Autonomy" is a law authorized by the Constitution. Article 108, Paragraph 1 of the new Constitution refers to the "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy," which stipulates that the central government will legislate and delegate it to provinces and counties for implementation. Regarding the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government, Article 118 of the Constitution stipulates that separate laws will be enacted. The autonomy of ordinary municipalities, as stipulated in Article 128 of the Constitution, shall be governed by the provisions applicable to counties. According to the "Concise Table of Administrative Regions of the Republic of China" compiled by the Fangyu Division of the Ministry of Interior, the current administrative regions of our country include thirty-five provinces, twelve municipalities directly under the central government, including two thousand and twenty-one counties, fifty-one provincial-level cities, thirty-eight administrative bureaus, one administrative management bureau, one hundred and thirty-two Mongolian banners, and one Tibetan local area. These provinces, cities, and counties are considered "local self-government units." After the country gradually implements constitutional governance, all regions must, in accordance with certain conditions and timelines, progressively advance and implement autonomy. Therefore, the formulation and promulgation of the "General Rules for Provincial (City) and County Autonomy" is absolutely necessary at present. The Ministry of Interior originally had two drafts, A and B, with different content. According to Hu Ciwei, the convener of the original drafting committee, Draft A was more "practical," while Draft B was "closer to ideal." The Executive Yuan is yet to decide which draft is more suitable, or whether a new draft should be created. Draft A is divided into seven chapters with a total of sixty-seven articles, while Draft B is divided into five chapters with a total of thirty-eight articles. Although the spirit of the two drafts is not entirely the same, they both adopt a listing method for the organization and authority of local systems, similar to the implementation laws of Chapters 10 and 11 of the Constitution. The current draft of the general rules revised by the Executive Yuan is a simplification of the Ministry of Interior's Draft A, but the content and essence are a new draft, not a revision of the original draft. We have no objections to the revision procedure of the general rules draft, but its content is of great importance, and we hope that the executive and legislative authorities can conduct further careful review.</p>
<p>The main points of the autonomy general rules are threefold: First, it should be the common standard for implementing local autonomy and the legislative principle for provinces (cities) and counties to formulate provincial (city) and county autonomy laws. Second, it should, in accordance with Chapters 10 and 11 of the Constitution, make provisions on the implementation procedures for the organization and authority of local governments, the scope and objects of local autonomy. The constitutional design of the local system has many matters that need to be deduced and analogized. The autonomy general rules need to have appropriate enumeration to avoid difficulties in subsequent legislation and judicial interpretation. In particular, if the general rules stipulate local autonomy matters completely, the difficulty of issuing supplementary regulations can be avoided. Third, its regulations should have great flexibility because our country has a vast territory, and the situation in each county is different. The law cannot force the impracticable to be practicable to avoid fettering its implementation in the future, hindering the development of autonomous expertise, and losing the original meaning of legislation. For this reason, the autonomy general rules should have an independent spirit, for the convenience of constitutional implementation, enumerate the standards that local autonomies commonly adhere to, and do not need to re-copy the content of the Constitution or change the spirit of certain clauses of the Constitution. This is what the executive and legislative authorities must be careful about.</p>
<p>The current autonomy general rules draft revised and approved by the Executive Yuan contains a total of thirty-four articles, and there are not many major features that can be commented on. Except for Article 2, which stipulates that "provinces and counties are legal persons," Article 29, which stipulates that local autonomy should be subject to administrative supervision, and Article 30, which stipulates that autonomous supervisory authorities have the right to dissolve unconstitutional public opinion organs, most of the other articles are the same as the provisions of the Constitution, or even completely identical. In particular, Article 21 stipulates that provincial business institutions do not have grades, nor do they determine departments; Article 27 stipulates that county business institutions do not establish sections or bureaus according to the county's grades and needs, which seems impractical. Regarding the organization and election of provincial people's congresses, the Constitution stipulates that "it shall be determined by law." This "law" can be interpreted as the "Autonomy General Rules" or another organization law election law. Chapter 4 of the draft autonomy general rules does not stipulate the organization and election of provincial people's congresses. In this case, provincial people's congresses will fall into a situation where it is impossible to convene, organize, and elect, let alone formulate provincial autonomy laws? The "Autonomy General Rules" is a central legislation authorized by the Constitution, which is used to stipulate the procedural law for provinces and counties to formulate provincial self-government laws, and should enumerate and regulate the organization, convening, and election matters of the provincial people's congress for comparison.</p>
<p>The above discussion is based on objective facts. We hope that the autonomy general rules will become a complete legal code to fulfill the country's constitutional legislation. Local autonomy is not a theory that is out of reach. It can be implemented as long as it is practical. Legislation is a system design, not an unpredictable and profound technology. It can be implemented as long as it is thorough and clear. Local autonomy is the minimum politics of a constitutional country. The law on traveling to local autonomy must at least achieve thorough and clear design. We ask the executive and legislative authorities for reference.</p>

The original proposal was divided into three parts: A, Intention: Permitting manufacturers, at the same price and in the same spirit of adhering to the principle of sale, to submit statements indicating the facts and reasons, and if approved by the Supervisory Committee, they shall be granted priority purchase. B, Principles: Private textile industries in the rear that supplied military needs during the war or suffered losses; Original factories forcibly occupied, damaged, or forced to sell to the enemy and puppets during the occupation period; Those who sold to the enemy and puppets automatically and voluntarily during or before the war shall not be granted priority purchase; Local governments operating textile industries shall not be granted priority purchase because it is inconsistent with the principle of selling to private enterprises. C, Revocation of Permit: If the purchaser cannot comply with the regulations and pay the factory price within a certain period, the priority purchase shall be revoked.</p>
<p>Six Departments Complete Review of Economic Reform Plan</p>

In addition to discussing the above cases, today's meeting also listened to a report from Shi Cida, who recently returned to the country, on his participation in the International Trade and Employment Conference.</p>
<h3>Chen Qitian Arrives in Jinan to Inspect Coal Mines and Discuss Transportation Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian arrived in Jinan on the special train for the inaugural ceremony of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway through traffic on the 11th and is scheduled to return to Nanjing by the same train on the 13th. He also told reporters in the train compartment that the main purpose of this trip was to inspect the four coal mines in Huainan, Yidong, Zhongxing, and Zibo, and listen to reports from the persons in charge of each mine to promote the plan decided in the National Coal Mine Production Increase Conference held in Nanjing before. Regarding coal transportation matters, he also consulted with the Railway Bureau and the Transportation Command and decided to assign a special train exclusively for coal transportation. He said that as long as the Tianjin-Pukou section maintains normal transportation status, there will be no problem with coal for winter use around Nanjing in a month because, according to estimates, at least 150,000 tons of coal can be transported south in a month. He also said that reforming the currency system can solve the current economic difficulties, and reform can stabilize people's lives and financial revenues and expenditures. However, the new currency must be backed by 60% cash reserves to guarantee its credit. As for whether state-owned enterprises can be used as reserves, Chen said that there are many difficulties and it is not easy to believe in people. Chen also expressed his views on the implementation of the cotton yarn control measures, saying that after the implementation of the measures, manufacturers' dissatisfaction and the difficulties encountered by the government in implementation are inevitable facts, but it is an exaggeration to say that it is enough to put manufacturers to death. He cited the fact that the control measures implemented in the rear during the pre-victory period were far stricter than the current ones, but there are still many yarn factories that survive. When reporters from this newspaper asked him for his opinion on the issuance of large banknotes, he said that the time was too late because, compared with pre-war and post-war prices, the current 100,000-yuan banknote is only worth two yuan in pre-war legal tender. He said that the state of turbulence caused by the issuance of large banknotes in the market is an economic psychological illness.</p>

<h3>Marshall Firmly Demands Soviet Union Stop Acquiring German Materials; Urges Molotov to Provide a Clear Answer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 10th] According to the Daily Telegraph diplomatic correspondent, the US government urgently needs Marshall to return to Washington, and Marshall has suggested to his government that he return home on the 15th. The correspondent predicts that a shocking crisis will occur at the end of this week's Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 10th discussed the issue of extracting reparations in kind and again reached a stalemate. Marshall then issued the strongest statement since the beginning of this Foreign Ministers' Conference, demanding that the Soviet Union immediately provide a concrete answer, pointing out that the current policy of delay and indecision must be stopped. If the four powers cannot reach an agreement on this major issue, it would be an unacceptable waste of time. However, he also solemnly declared that the United States will never agree to extract reparations in kind as the price for unifying the German economy. After Marshall finished stating his position, Molotov suggested adjourning the meeting. The dispute over the issue of extracting reparations in kind arose during the discussion of the main British proposal, which stated: "No German products or stored products should be extracted as reparations until Germany has achieved a balanced economy and has repaid the expenses advanced by the occupying powers." Marshall stated that until the Soviet delegation provides a clear answer on the issue of extracting reparations in kind, all items currently under discussion, such as import and export plans, the distribution of German export earnings, the occupation fee agreement, and the balance of the German economy, cannot be clarified. The US government believes that the reparations issue was finally resolved in Potsdam, and the United States will never agree to a plan to extract reparations in kind. Unexpectedly, the actual development was completely the opposite. The UK and the US import 700 million US dollars worth of food to West Germany to maintain the lives of Germans, while the Soviet Union removes 500 million US dollars worth of German assets from East Germany annually. German enterprises in the East have been successively seized by Soviet trusts, and in addition, a large number of German workers have been forced to go to the Soviet Union. This situation must be corrected immediately and should not be delayed indefinitely, otherwise the German economy will be completely destroyed, and the entire European economy will be in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Marshall then proposed his resolution, which stated: "From January 1, 1948, no items may be transported out of Germany except for money and goods of appropriate economic value that can be immediately used to maintain the German economy. This resolution shall remain in effect until the Allied Control Council takes other actions or the peace treaty provides otherwise. However, this resolution does not apply to factory machinery etc. already agreed to be used as reparations." The British and French foreign ministers stated that Marshall's resolution required further consideration. Molotov stated that he would provide an answer when discussing the general reparations issue.</p>
<p>Today's meeting discussed the following proposals in the basic document: The repayment of advances by the Allied powers by Germany; Occupation fees; The handling of foreign expropriation of German corporate interests after the end of the European War; The subjection of foreign interests in Germany to German law; The issue of products available at any time; The dissolution of German monopolistic enterprises.

<h3>The General Confederation of Labour's Demands Were Not Met; The General Strike in Rome Begins; The Government Plans to Use Force if Necessary</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 11th] Rome experienced its first general strike in 25 years this morning, which is the winter offensive launched by leftists against the Gasperi government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 11th] A thousand striking workers gathered in downtown Rome. The police arrived and ordered the crowd to disperse. The workers refused to obey the order. The police then drove jeeps at high speed into the crowd, while swinging batons and hitting people on the head. At least two workers were seriously injured and twelve were arrested. The demonstrators dispersed in all directions five minutes later. This is the first riot since the general strike was organized by the Communist Party. The action of the police this time shows that the government plans to use force if necessary. The French government has successfully suppressed labor unrest by this means.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The Rome City General Confederation of Labour previously requested the government to issue Christmas bonuses and other benefits to unemployed workers, but the government failed to give a satisfactory answer.

The strike will continue indefinitely until the General Confederation of Labour issues a subsequent notice. All public transport, such as trams, buses, theaters, and restaurants, will cease operations from midnight.

The government has stated that it is prepared to immediately implement a public works plan that can accommodate 8,000 to 10,000 unemployed workers, but it believes that it is not appropriate to give special treatment to the unemployed in Rome regarding the provision of relief funds, and has refused.</p>
<h3>Economic Merger of British and American Zones in Germany; Britain and the United States Have Reached an Agreement; Occupation Expenses to Be Borne Solely by the United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 10th] According to reliable sources tonight, the US and UK have reached an agreement, which in effect gives the United States sole authority over the economic and financial policies of the British and American economic zones in Germany. The amended documents of last year's merger agreement have been finalized and delivered to London from Washington.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that US Secretary of the Army Royall told the US Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday that as a result of the negotiations between the UK and the US in Washington on German occupation fees, the United States will henceforth have control over economic and financial affairs in the two zones.

It is understood that the Washington negotiations only involved revising the method of sharing occupation fees and the establishment of a joint import and export agency. The United States may have most of the control in that agency. The agreement is still awaiting formal approval by the two governments.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The United Kingdom formally granted independence to Burma and Ceylon, with a population of 21 million, on the 11th. Burma will secede from the British Commonwealth and become an independent sovereign republic on January 4th. Ceylon will become a quasi-autonomous dominion within the British Commonwealth from today. The British King's edict approving the Burmese and Ceylonese Independence Acts was read out today in the House of Lords, according to ancient custom, by a royal commission composed of three nobles, to the members of both the Upper and Lower Houses. The two independent nations of Burma and Ceylon were thus born.</p>
<p>Both Burma and Ceylon have signed treaties with the UK stipulating their relationship with Britain after independence. Burmese Prime Minister Aung San recently came to London to sign the Anglo-Burmese Treaty and stated publicly that the Republic of Burma will continue to maintain the most friendly relations with Britain. The Burmese Constitution has been drafted by the Burmese Constituent Assembly and provides for the establishment of a Burmese Federation with a bicameral Federal Parliament, which will elect a President and appoint a Prime Minister to form a cabinet. Each state in the Federation may elect representatives to participate in the Federal Parliament through the State Parliament. Ceylon, with an area of 25,000 square miles, was originally a direct colony under the rule of the British King. After Lord Soulbury led a committee to investigate the island in 1944, the Soulbury Constitution was established, granting Ceylon full internal autonomy. Foreign affairs and national defense remained the responsibility of Britain. The new government of the island was produced after the general election in September of this year. After independence, it will exchange high commissioners with Britain.</p>

<h3>Beset by Foreign and Domestic Problems, Iranian Cabinet Resigns En Masse; Soviets Stir Up Separatist Movement in Azerbaijan Province</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, November 11th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultanah suddenly announced to the plenary session of the Parliament on the morning of the 11th: "Our country's domestic and foreign affairs are approaching a serious crisis. I feel that I can no longer continue to serve and will present my resignation and that of my cabinet to the King tonight." Sultanah left the Parliament immediately after the announcement.</p>
<p>At the door of the Parliament, he further explained to reporters, "The main reason for my resignation is that I cannot prevent the separatist movement in the semi-autonomous province of Azerbaijan in northern Iran. Furthermore, the entanglement with the Soviet Union over the oil issue cannot be resolved. The development in Azerbaijan is directly due to Soviet pressure. History will judge my merits and demerits." All members of Sultanah's cabinet except three had submitted their resignations to Sultanah last week. Sultanah himself stated that he would not resign unless Parliament passed a vote of no confidence in him. However, as criticism from all sides intensified in the past 24 hours, he had to reconsider his position. The resignation of most of his cabinet members was prompted by the Soviet Union's renewed note to Iran, reiterating its demand for Iran to ratify the 1945 Soviet-Iranian oil agreement. Sultanah's broadcast address was met with dissatisfaction by most cabinet members, and the opposition accused him of being too pro-Soviet. Observers predict that after Sultanah's resignation, the Soviet Union and Iran will enter a diplomatic showdown.</p>

<h3>Eighteen Rice Merchants Arrested in Two Locations, Market Stalls Across North And South Cease Business For A Time. Mayor Wu Reportedly Immediately Orders Release of Arrested Parties. The Requests From The Entire Management Committee Are Met With A Satisfactory Response.</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Yesterday, the rice market briefly suspended business at 10:00 AM, due to economic police arresting multiple rice merchants. The markets resumed trading at 10:30 AM. In the afternoon, the entire market management committee petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu and Section Chief Ji met with the committee and gave their response. The arrested rice merchants were released at 3:00 PM yesterday. Today, trading is expected to return to normal.</p>
<p>Following the issuance of the large denomination notes the other day, the Social Affairs Bureau noted a sharp rise in the price of rice, which increased in value from fifty thousand to one hundred thousand dollars per load, especially in the Northern Market. To stabilize the price of rice, Director Lee summoned the market management committee and each group leader to a discussion at the Northern Rice Market yesterday morning. Thirty-five people attended, including Xu Songren, Gu Yisheng, and Cha Baoshan. Section Chief Lee explained several points: The issuance of large denomination notes was to meet demand; the recent price fluctuations are problematic; and today's prices must be lower than yesterday's prices to ease people's minds. All attendees accepted and expressed willingness to do their utmost to cooperate with the government. After the meeting, they entered the market and began trading. All stall prices fell by about twenty thousand dollars. The market management committee also issued a notice of self-discipline to ensure that trading prices are reasonable. Shortly after this, economic police entered the market for inspection. They arrested eleven people in the Southern Market and seven in the Northern Market. As a result, the market became chaotic, and business was suspended from 10:00 AM. Section Chief Ji immediately returned to the bureau to report the situation to Director Wu, who then telephoned Mayor Wu. After receiving the report, Mayor Wu immediately called Police Bureau Director Yu, instructing him that in the future, when economic police carry out tasks in the food market, they should contact the Social Affairs Bureau's on-site personnel to ensure consistent action and avoid causing unrest among merchants and disrupting the market. The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for managing the North and South rice markets. The Mayor then ordered the police bureau to release the arrested rice merchants. Section Chief Ji of the Social Affairs Bureau's Food Section immediately persuaded the rice merchants to resume business, which they did at 7:30 PM. At 3:30 PM in the afternoon, the entire market management committee from the North and South rice markets, including Yin Fuxiang, Xu Songren, and Cha Baoshan, and more than thirty other members, petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition to requesting the release of those arrested, they submitted a document requesting several points: Economic police must carry out activities legally, and must not treat "price limits" as illegal measures; the legitimate costs of grain merchants should be taken into account, and legitimate grain merchants should not be suppressed with high-handed political means; government-business cooperation should be thoroughly implemented, and grain merchants should not be regarded as enemies. Director Wu and Section Chief Ji met with the committee and gave their response: Do not seek exorbitant profits, and maintain reasonable grain prices. The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for market management. In the future, when economic police inspect the market or discover illegal grain merchants who need to be arrested, they will coordinate with the Social Affairs Bureau. The eighteen arrested rice merchants were released at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The petitioning market management committee members expressed satisfaction with the replies from Director Wu and Section Chief Ji, and guaranteed that they would not engage in illegal transactions. The disruption came to an end.</p>
<h3>Yong Yarn Prices Soar, Police Intervene, Two Trading Misunderstandings Occur</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Yesterday, the securities market in this city, experienced a cessation of trading due to the Garrison Command dispatching personnel to suppress the bidding up of prices, which led to the market collapsing both in the morning and the afternoon. However, after explanations from both sides, the misunderstandings were resolved, and the market is expected to return to normal today.</p>
<p>The Garrison Command personnel, accompanied by securities exchange staff, entered the trading floor at approximately 10:00 AM yesterday to monitor trading. At about 11:45 AM, when the buying and selling price of Yong Yarn was called at $403 and $404, a broker bid five dollars higher. The Garrison Command personnel stationed on-site considered the broker to be engaged in price gouging, intervened, and confiscated the broker's trading documents. After it was explained that the transaction price did not exceed the legally permitted daily increase limit, the misunderstanding was cleared up. The trading documents were immediately returned, and trading continued. Yong Yarn closed at $401. In the afternoon, brokers were unsettled by the morning's interruption of trading. The Red Yarn market finally opened at 2:10 PM, followed by the White Yarn market. Near 3:00 PM, when the buying and selling price of White Yarn was called at eight and ten dollars, broker number 219 bid nine dollars to buy, which was again considered price gouging by the Garrison Command personnel stationed on-site. The broker was temporarily surrounded in the trading counter in the center of the market. The general brokers were rather perturbed and at a loss as to what to do, and the market temporarily suspended. On the floor of the market, Yu Mingshi, representing those stationed there, requested the securities exchange authorities to guarantee that market transactions within the legally permitted range of price fluctuations would be protected. After several meetings and explanations, a satisfactory resolution was reached, but it was already close to closing time. Yong Yarn closed at $409 in the afternoon. According to broker sources, the market should operate as usual today if there are no unexpected interruptions.</p>

<h3>No Snow This Winter? Public Reasoning vs. Mother-in-Law's Logic in Climate Observations and Astronomical Measurements</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Will there be snow this winter? And when will it start snowing? Many people are speculating. Father Long Xiangqi of the Xujiahui Observatory believes that the climate was warm in October this year. Based on his past annual experiences, he deduced that there probably would not be any snow this winter, or the snowfall period would be very late. However, according to Director Zheng Zizheng of the Meteorological Station, the period with the most snowfall in Shanghai in previous years is the solar month of January, with less snowfall in December and February. Although the end of the year has not yet arrived, the continuous overcast skies indicate that the humidity along the coast is very high. Additionally, the high-pressure system from the north is moving, and it is expected to reach Central China next Monday or Tuesday. If the humid air is still over the coastal area at that time, encountering this cold front may immediately cause snowfall. In recent months, the high-pressure system has enveloped various parts of North China, and snowfall has already occurred. There has also been a heavy snowstorm in Japan, which has not stopped yet. Therefore, it is probably not a fact that Shanghai will not have snowfall or that the snowfall period will be delayed. The Shanghai Meteorological Station's weather forecast for today is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yellow Sea: Sunny to cloudy, freezing, light haze or fog, moderate west to north winds, moderate waves. Central China: Cloudy, cold to cloudy, moderate north to east winds, fog in the morning and evening. Shanghai: Cloudy, haze, cold to cloudy, moderate north to east winds, fog in the morning and evening. East China Sea: Cloudy to rainy, strong north to northeast winds, strong winds in the Taiwan Strait. Haze and morning fog along the coast, huge waves.</p>
<p>November 11th temperature: Maximum 44 degrees, minimum 38.5 degrees. Who is right and who is wrong? Let's wait for later verification.</p>
<h3>Director of Financial Bureau Hosts Reporters, Actively Cracking Down on Speculation and Protecting Legitimate Manufacturers, No Problems Expected for Finance and Prices This Year</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Li Lixia, Director of the Municipal Financial Bureau, and Deputy Director Bi Delin, assumed their posts yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, they hosted the press and issued the following statement: The Financial Bureau is determined to adhere to the principle of equal management for officials and merchants, Chinese and foreigners, actively crack down on speculation, stabilize finance, and increase production. The new measures to freeze gold and banknote speculation have been amended by the Ministry of Finance, submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval, and will be promulgated and implemented soon. Everyone will be subject to these measures. In the future, we will cooperate with local agencies such as the Garrison Command to expand the scope of investigation, not just based on passive reports. We will protect legitimate manufacturers. We are now preparing to concentrate our efforts to strictly review the lending of commercial banks and severely crack down on gold and banknote speculation, making it unprofitable for operators and diverting idle funds back to the right track. Regarding the crackdown on the black market for US dollars between Hong Kong and Shanghai, we have already worked with the Garrison Command to crack down on six or seven secret private radio stations. At the same time, we have received detailed reports on those who engage in Hong Kong exchange transactions. We will take stringent measures against underground banks. Director Li also told reporters that commercial banks may tend to specialize in the future, becoming a department of a certain industrial or commercial enterprise. Ordinary commercial banks may find it difficult to survive. Finally, he hopes that the people will eliminate the psychological anxiety following the issuance of large denomination notes, and that there will be no problems with finance and prices before the New Year.</p>

<h3>Refugees Occupying Guild Halls Resemble Collective Organizations, Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Formulate Disposal Measures</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] According to the authorities' investigation, thousands of refugees are occupying coffin depositories, funeral homes, and guild halls in Zhabei and the Southern City. They call themselves "Righteous People's Shelters" or "Cold Protection Shelters," and have now established a ninth branch. They have requested the Social Affairs Bureau to issue winter relief materials, but all requests have been rejected by the Social Affairs Bureau. Investigations by the Police Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau have revealed that most of them are not genuine refugees. Some have rented out their original shacks and moved in, while others have jobs and bring their families to live there. Some have also formed gangs, resembling group organizations. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to send the elderly, weak, women, and children to the winter relief shelters, and send the able-bodied to the work relief shelters. If they are unwilling to enter the shelters or work relief centers, they will be deemed non-refugees, and a report will be submitted to the mayor to strictly ban them.</p>

The construction sites have been selected in Caohejing, Jiangwan, Yangjing, and Dachang districts. Several shelters are set up near the construction sites, and the construction of the workshops has already begun bidding. The number of workers in each district is 500, totaling 2,000 people. The work period is three months, and the labor cost is 3.56 billion yuan, which will be paid in advance by the municipal treasury. In addition to providing food, lodging, and winter clothing for the work relief refugees, they will be paid 10,000 yuan per cubic meter of earth excavated. If they work diligently, they can excavate two cubic meters of earth per day. The Public Works Bureau is responsible for the design work and the command and supervision of the construction. The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for the organization of workers and the management of food and lodging.

<h3>Bizarre Murder Case Occurred in Suzhou Yesterday, Pu Deming, Platoon Leader of the Fifth Platoon, First Battalion of Signal Soldiers, Was Brutally Killed, The Murderer And The Motive Are Still Being Investigated</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Suzhou, 11th] A bizarre murder case occurred in Suzhou today. The victim was Pu Deming, the platoon leader of the Fifth Platoon of the First Battalion of new soldiers of the Wuxian Regiment Management District's lost wife, (Pu was from Sichuan, 30 years old, Li, 24 years old) who was murdered in the dormitory in front of Baolin Temple.

<h3>Wu Chao, the Main Criminal in the Fuzhou Body Disposal Case, Straightforwardly Admits to Murdering But Not Stealing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Fuzhou, 8th] Wu Chao, the main criminal in the sensational San Ying Murder Case in Fuzhou, and the accomplices Zhang Liangdong, Chuan Xiuying (Zhang's wife), and Wu Yan (Wu's cousin) were escorted from Xianyou via Fuqing on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM yesterday, the local court held a trial presided over by Prosecutor Chen Peiji. Wu Chao was first summoned. Wu wore black Han-style clothing and black shoes, had a Western hairstyle, and was calm. After the prosecutor finished asking about his age and background, he asked the reason for murdering Zheng Qingjing and what happened at the time. Wu immediately admitted to it and described his</p>
<p>actions in detail. It is said that: He was first a soldier, graduated from the Fujian Security Cadre Training Institute, and later partnered with Zheng Qingjing to open the Southeast Company. The total capital was NT$150,000, divided into three shares, Zheng with two shares, acting as manager, and he with one share, in charge of accounting. Last year in December, Zheng Qingjing transported a batch of gray cloth back to Xianyou for sale, but Zheng never returned, which caused the store's turnover to be unsustainable. He had issued several telegrams, but Zheng ignored them, so he took NT$400,000 back to Rong. Before long, Zheng came to Rong to "settle accounts" with him and requested to pay</p>
<p>back 50 million legal tender based on the "soybean cake" price in Taiwan. The two sides insisted on not giving in, and Zheng wanted to detain him and send him to the military police. Later, Zhang Liangdong and others mediated. He first went to Taiwan to settle accounts and then discussed it again after returning. On October 1, Deng came to Rong from Taiwan and inquired about his residence at Zhang Liangdong's house. At that time, he happened to be in Zhang Liangdong's next room. After hearing the news, he planned to find a way to escape back to Xianyou. On October 4, Zhang Liangdong's wife Chuan Xiuying lived in Xiahang Street, and Zhang lived in the Nantai Overseas Chinese Reception Center, waiting for him to return to Xianyou together. Unexpectedly, when he returned to the San Ying home to pick up a quilt that day, he happened to meet Zheng Qingjing who came to interrogate him, so he reluctantly went into the</p>
<p>room to discuss. Zheng still insisted on paying him back tens of millions of yuan, otherwise he would demolish his residence in Xianju, so he temporarily stayed at his place. On the same night, his fellow villager Chen Yuanlu bought two catties of wine and one catty of noodles, and the three ate together. Zheng Qingjing fell asleep on the bed after drinking only a few cups. At that time, he suddenly had the intention to kill, so he invited Chen Yuanlu to use an axe to strike Zheng Qingjing's left forehead and face five or six times.</p>
<p>Blood flowed like a torrent, and he died on the spot. At that time, he was still afraid that he was not dead, so he used a brown rope to tighten Zheng's throat. Then he pried open the floor, dug four feet, and buried the body. The next day, he bought 10,000 yuan of coal and scattered it on top, and prepared to return to Xianyou. The helper Chen Yuanlu was immediately rewarded with more than 100,000 yuan in cash and a gold ring, and fled to Jiangxi. He only got 100,000 yuan in cash, a 2.4 million yuan check, a gold ring, and a brown suit. Besides that, there was nothing else. When Zhang Liangdong, Chuan Xiuying, and Wu Yan were interrogated, they all denied participating in the murder. The interrogation lasted for four hours before it was completed. All the prisoners were sent back to prison, and the trial will be held another day.</p>

[Report from our Nanjing, 11th] Various provincial and municipal governments report that the treatment of faculty and staff in provincial and municipal colleges and universities differs greatly from that in national colleges and universities, making it extremely difficult to attract and retain outstanding teachers, which greatly affects the future of higher education.

The Ministry of Education has already forwarded the request, with specific measures including salary supplements, special subsidies, and academic research subsidies being the same for both national, provincial, and municipal schools.

<p>Museums and Socialization – The Importance of Rebuilding the City Museum - Li Shizeng</p>
<p>Socialization and Globalization</p>
<p>Socialization is a medicine for social ills, as well as a natural law and inevitable destination of social development. Its purpose is to enable everyone in society to do their best and take what they need, so that no one is prevented from doing their best or taking what they need due to the private ownership and control of property and power. The largest scope of socialization is naturally the socialization of the world. The globalization of the world is certainly not something that can be achieved overnight, but as long as we take small steps towards the path of socialization, we will eventually reach the largest scope.</p>
<p>Museums and Socialization</p>
<p>In the past, only emperors, nobles, wealthy merchants, and tycoons were able to collect and appreciate strange artifacts, antiques, rare birds, and exotic animals as private property. When these things came into the hands of scholars, they were appraised, studied, and published as works, allowing the general public to indirectly gain some knowledge from them, thus taking the first step towards socialization. Taking it a step further, when these items are displayed in museums, in addition to scholars, the public and general students also have the opportunity to understand history and appreciate art. Compared to being imprisoned in the hands of a few people, this is more reasonable. Therefore, museums are a good example of cultural socialization.</p>
<p>Museums and Globalization</p>
<p>Libraries and museums are both good institutions for cultural socialization, but books are limited by the differences in languages. Books in language A cannot be fully translated into languages B, C, etc. Therefore, people who use languages B, C, etc. cannot fully read books in language A. Museums are different; there is no linguistic barrier. Therefore, libraries and museums are both necessary for cultural exchange in the world, but the effect of museums is even more significant.</p>
<p>Museums are one of the three-dimensional encyclopedias</p>
<p>We are engaged in the work of a world encyclopedia, not only wanting to construct a collective human brain on paper (as Mr. H.G. Wells, a colleague of the world encyclopedia, said), but also wanting to make it three-dimensional and dynamic, becoming things and institutions that promote civilization. Because museums are one of the three-dimensional encyclopedias, we who are engaged in the work of a world encyclopedia hope that more museums can be established everywhere, especially hoping that they have great architecture and appropriate exhibits.</p>
<p>Urban Museums and Local Museums</p>
<p>On the one hand, cities have a large population, and on the other hand, they are the place where people from all over the world travel. Whether in social education or cultural exchange, they should have great museums. Today, every place has its relationship with other parts of the world. In order to enable residents of various places to gain knowledge and understand their relationship with the world, there should also be museums. (The French scholar Shao Ke Lu once established a local museum and invented an instrument to show the relationship between each place and other parts of the world. I once named it "Cosmic Orientation Instrument.")</p>
<p>The Necessity of Constructing and Expanding the Shanghai City Museum</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Museum was located in the central area of Jiangwan before the war, with quite grand architecture and relatively rich exhibits. After the war, the museum building was dilapidated, and the recovered surviving exhibits are still considerable. It is really necessary to build a great museum in today's city center as soon as possible and expand its exhibits to show the microcosm of a global cultural metropolis.</p>
<p>Society Drives Government Implementation</p>
<p>I often say that in the current government and society, like the two wheels of a car and the two wings of a bird, they complement each other, and no effort will be in vain. Regarding the construction and expansion of the Shanghai City Museum, Director of Education Li Ximou believes that it should be promoted by society and implemented by the government. This view is very admirable. Therefore, the City Council successfully passed a resolution to use 6 billion yuan to build this museum and hand it over to the Municipal Government for overall planning. With such support from the public opinion organs, we hope that the new construction of the Shanghai City Museum can be realized soon!</p>
<p>The Progressive Motor Team Suffers a Crushing Defeat; The Shantou Team Only Has Four Players at the End of the Game with a Score of 57 to 36. [Report from our newspaper] The Motor Sixteen basketball team won the second game last night with a score of 57 to 36, a great victory over the Shantou team. In the first half, Motor Sixteen led by six points with a score of 26 to 20. A few minutes into the second half, Lin Weicong, a key player of the Shantou team, disrespected the referee and was sent off the court. The Shantou team finally disintegrated and fell sharply. By the second half, Chen Qingjiang was sent off again for committing five fouls, and the Shantou team was unable to recover. The Motor performance was quite wonderful, controlling the overall situation from beginning to end. The only tense game ended with a disappointing finish. The players from Motor Sixteen were Zheng Daguang, Liao Diheng, Jia Zhijun, Wang Shixuan, and Yu Ruizhang. The players from Shantou were Chen Qingjiang, Lin Weicong, He Lide, Ma Xiyi, and Cai Yanxiong. The referees were Xuan Hezu and Zhu Mingxing. Liao Diheng, a guest player, scored two consecutive goals, and Jia made a free throw, hanging up five points and making them invincible. He Lide of the Shantou team scored a free throw, breaking the record with a score of 6 to 2. Lin Weicong was sent off, and Ji Nankang substituted. The Shantou team has been sluggish ever since. Two on two, it was a one-sided affair. Both sides committed many fouls. The Shantou team fought hard, with a score of 26 to 20 in the first half. In the second half, Motor led by ten points again. The Shantou team's heart and strength were at odds, with a score of 34 to 24. Chen Qingjiang committed a foul and graduated, and four players fought the battle, becoming more and more unable to support it, and the game ended hastily with a score of 57 to 36.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Chinese Team Loses to the Hong Kong Star Team; The Score is 5 to 0.

The badminton league is scheduled to start tonight, with two Group B matches and one women's match, starting at 6:00 PM in the city gymnasium. Group A, due to the small number of teams, has fewer matches and is postponed to the first Monday in January next year. The remaining Group B women's and mixed groups will be held in the gymnasium every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, as stipulated, starting today. Tonight's schedule is as follows: Kang Le - West Qing Hong (Group B Two) starting at 6:00 PM, Jia Yi Jia - Xiao Guang (Group B One) starting at 7:00 PM, Sheng Lian - You Zhong (Women's) starting at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Amateur Sports Association Will Be Established.

Twenty-odd people attended, including Chairman Yu Liren, New Technology Expert Cha Ruilong, and Secretary-General Wan Yi, and decided to establish the association in the near future.</p>
<p>The Defeat of the Shantou Team</p>
<p>The game between Motor Sixteen and the Petroleum Team disappointed nearly three thousand spectators at the venue. The entire game can be divided into four stages: 1. The Shantou team committed repeated fouls, falling behind by 3 to 14. 2. Cai and Ma worked hard, chasing to end the first half with a score of 20 to 26. 3. The guest team's players could shoot well, and Qingjiang was restricted by Da Guang and Cao Zhi and could not develop. 4. The Shantou team fought with four players and could not resist. Lin Weicong's disrespect for the referee and being sent off the court was not the key to yesterday's victory or defeat. Motor Sixteen has all the advantages over the Shantou team. The shooting percentage that the Shantou team has always maintained, the guest team actually surpassed it. Chen Qingjiang of the Shantou team could not move, and Lin Weicong's aiming mid-range shots had no chance to be taken. He Lide's throws lacked certainty. On the contrary, Ma Zai and Lao Cha, who usually abandoned shooting, scored points. Everyone in Motor Sixteen can shoot. Using their superior physical strength, they adopted a man-to-man tactic, forcing the Shantou team to be unable to break through to the basket, making it even more difficult for the Shantou team to score. As a member of the basketball committee and the leader of the Shantou team, Lin Zuoshi should have considered how to make the players obey the referee. Instead, he repeatedly showed a grumpy temper, which seemed inappropriate. (Reporter)</p>

<p>Tightening of Credit; Slack Trading; Dull Market Conditions for Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Due to continued tight credit yesterday, manufacturers and customers were slow to absorb cotton yarn, and trading among colleagues was also limited. There was a lot of reselling. The lowest price for 42 Blue Phoenix reached 48.2 million, but near the close of the market, customers took advantage of the low price to slightly increase their purchases, recovering to 48.6 million, which was 600,000 less than the previous day. The decline in 40-count yarn was even more severe, falling between 700,000-800,000 to 1.3-1.4 million. Other counts of coarse yarn saw fluctuations ranging from 120,000-450,000.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth and spinning mills opened cloth as usual, but due to the tightening of credit, trading was not prosperous. People in the industry were all watching and waiting, and customers were unable to advance due to difficulties in remittance. Retailers were quite active in buying and selling, seemingly trading high and low. Market fluctuations were still slight. Around 10:30, the Shanxi gang suddenly came to sell off their goods, and the selling trend started again, and the market fell again. Until the end, except for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth, which was stable, the prices of all other grades of fine cloth were uniformly reduced by 5,000-12,000 yuan. Biji cloth also dropped by about 20,000 yuan due to supply. The trend of other cloths was mostly soft.</p>
<p>The current cotton trend is still flat, and yarn mills still intend to buy. There were still many transactions among colleagues, and prices were stable. Cargo owners wanted to increase prices but there were no buyers, and retailers absorbed at low prices. Transactions totaled 670 packages, 400 dan. The factory price of Shashi 5.291 million was made, with 200 packages traded. The transaction price of Lingbao 5.291 million, Han Fine 4.58 million, Shashi 4.96 million, Wujiang 3.148 million to 4.687 million, Jingyang 5.498 million, Tongzhou 4.06 million, and Huoji 3.68 million, with 470 packages, 400 dan traded. Zhoupu cottonseed sold for 950,000.</p>
<p>Rice Slightly Weak; Prices of Miscellaneous Grains and Oils Also Drop More than 11,900 piculs of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets yesterday. The market situation was stable in the morning and fatigued in the afternoon. Japonica and indica rice fell by 10,000-20,000 yuan near closing. Flour initially rose and then fell back, and the trend softened. Bran fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan, and soybean cake showed relaxation in Taiwan. The rise stopped and fell more, falling back by 5,000-6,000 yuan. Soybeans have not escaped the fatigue and are still lacking energy. Mung beans were desold in a plain manner, and prices were flat and fair. Rainbow beans were digested in a sluggish manner and fell another 10,000 yuan. Both delivery and sales of green beans were thin, and market conditions were mediocre. Sales of red sorghum were not strong and were stable. Corn from Beiyang was lively but not refreshing, with high prices followed by reductions. Oil mills were not greedy for sesame oil, and the market was cold and sluggish, raising prices and reducing them several times. Both milk sesame and jute fell by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to move in Guangdong, with little honor or disgrace for the time being. The oil market was mixed, with soybean oil and rapeseed oil showing poor sales and falling by 20,000-30,000 yuan. There were not many shipments of raw oil, and the store was active, rising by 20,000-30,000 yuan. [Report from our newspaper] The flour market is subject to a daily limit of no more than 5% increase or decrease for each commodity, so the transaction situation has been relatively stable recently. However, the stock base of each commodity is weak, and fluctuations will inevitably occur in the future. In order to plan ahead, the Bureau of Social Affairs has specially advised manufacturers to increase supplies to stabilize market prices.</p>
<p>Sugar Prices Show Mixed Ups and Downs;</p>
<p>The sugar market yesterday showed mixed ups and downs, and the trend was flat. The association drew the line at 24 coarse white stack small packages at 1.17 million yuan, spot large packages at 1.19 million yuan, small packages at 34,000 yuan, and 20 medium sand white oil packages at 1.145-1.15 million yuan, 1,000 packages at 1.16 million yuan, rising by 23,000 yuan due to a shortage of goods. United Red was at 1.15 million yuan, with not much up or down. Shantou Qinggao goods were at 900,000 yuan, totaling 150 packages. Xinghua Baigao goods were at 1.18-1.19 million yuan, and Armed goods were at 1.16 million yuan. Xingchi rose by 23,000 yuan, with good goods at 1.12-1.13 million yuan and ordinary goods at 1.1 million yuan, totaling more than 700 pieces. Diaogao was at 834,000 yuan, totaling several hundred packages.</p>

Sugar merchants will be allotted 45 cars of white sugar, and sugar factories will be allotted large packages of coarse granulated sugar. The quantities are the same as in Period 43, and the prices remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Tea Market is Sluggish. The domestic tea market was still active yesterday because there were still transactions between local merchants and cargo owners. In terms of prices, they stood firm. As for foreign business transactions, the price bid by sellers were all displayed. The results fell into a state of stagnation. The industry insiders said: At present, British businessmen are even more eager to buy Qimen black tea, but the price they offer is too stingy, and the suppliers are affected by the shortage of inventory and refuse to sell easily. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to expect a deal to be reached in a short time.</p>
<p>Police Officers Arrive on the Scene to Supervise; The Stock Market Trend is Hazy; Rumors Abounded; The Market Initially Weak and Then Strong; A Powerful Group Outside the Market Pulled Back and Rose Rapidly; Police Officers Arrived on the Scene for the First Time to Supervise; Due to a Lack of Understanding of Technical Issues, the Market Became Hazy and Normal Trading Could Not Be Conducted in the Aftermarket.</p>
<p>The opening performance in the morning was low. Yongsha opened at 393 yuan and 405 yuan, then fell to 366 yuan and 401 yuan, and then rose slightly to 391 yuan and 407 yuan. The premium for deferred delivery was high, and the interest rate outside the market was still at 22.5 and 27, and the credit was extremely tight, forcing a further decline to a low price of 383 yuan for immediate delivery and 401 yuan for deferred delivery. A certain Xu from Nanjing outside the market purchased enthusiastically, once rising to a high price of 408 yuan for immediate delivery and 430 yuan for deferred delivery. Later, due to the arrival of police officers to supervise the market and intervene, market confidence was shaken, and the market closed at 401 yuan and 409 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Jinglun rose by 50%, and Yongsha, Xinha, Meiya, Zhongfa, Xinhua, lingerie, Yonggong, National Goods, Matches, Zhongsitongyi, Zhongfang, and Zhongxing rose slightly. Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinyu, Huaxinrong, and Datong were flat, and the rest declined slightly. The deferred delivery shares had a negative premium. Therefore, Xinha and Meiya Qin Xing rose by 50%, and the rest rose slightly. There was an invisible market suspension for more than half an hour in the afternoon. Yu Shiqi, the person in charge of the Brokerage Association, came to the scene to persuade, and the deferred delivery of Yongsha was barely opened by No. 22 and others, but trading was still light. Yongsha initially saw 422 yuan, but it was reported that the national bank had entered a large amount of money, and it fell to 412 yuan. Other shares other than deferred delivery had no trading. Then it recovered to 428 yuan, and spot yarn rose slightly from 407 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 3 o'clock, No. 219 bought in at a price of 409 yuan in the process of immediate delivery of Yongsha from 408 yuan to 410 yuan, and was again intervened by police officers, and the market was suspended again. The market closed at the last traded price of 409 yuan and 425 yuan. There were very few transactions in the remaining shares, and the gains and losses of the current and deferred shares were slight compared to the morning close. The old shares and Xinxin outside the market rose by more than 10% and were still stable. The interest rate on current deferred arbitrage trading rose from low to high yesterday, with those entering at a discount of 14 to 22, and those exiting at a discount of 17 to 25. The financial community initially entered at a discount and then exited at a discount, which led to this situation. Yongsha opened at 15 yuan, rising from 14.5 yuan to 20 yuan, and closed at 17.5 yuan. Xinha rose from 7.5 yuan to 9.5 yuan, Meiya rose from 22 yuan to 27 yuan, and Xinguang was at about 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Convenient Accounting Settlement; Deferred Delivery to be Cleared at the End of the Year; [Report from our newspaper] Since the Stock Exchange opened for deferred delivery, it has been more than 50 periods. At the recent (10th) Rules and Regulations Meeting, for the convenience of accounting and settlement, all deferred deliveries are limited to be completed before the 31st of this month. After a period of notification, after the closure from January 1st to 4th next year, the new deferred delivery will be officially reopened on January 5th. In addition, the total amount of accounts receivable for deferred delivery up to the last session was 47,195,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Unified Bonds Weaken; Foreign Stocks Mediocre;</p>
<p>Government bonds were slightly weaker yesterday, with a turnover of only 3 million. The morning opening price of Unified C was 27,500 yuan, the low price was 25,000 yuan, and it hovered around 277,300 yuan, which was 300 yuan lower than the previous close for A, B, and D, and 200 yuan lower for C and E. Although market sentiment was good yesterday, the Hong Kong electricity price rebounded, and external stimulation also eased. Banks and Guangdong gangs both exited, and securities gangs exited and then entered. Retailers entered slightly. Yisha opened in the morning at 383,000 yuan, and the high price approached 400,000 before there was any trading. Compared with the previous close, Yisha Yinglianye Guangzhiban Yihang Hangye Tongye Yinghua rose. Tram, Electricity, Huaxiangtai, and Langezhi were flat, and Zilai, Huidepin, and Hui were slightly lower.</p>
<p>Credit is Difficult to Ease Temporarily. According to the observation of financial authorities, in order to stabilize finance and suppress prices, the authorities are taking massive sales and universal rationing policies for all controllable materials. Therefore, from last Tuesday to the 10th, the amount of money entered by banks and bureaus has reached 408.4 billion yuan. It has been decided that oil and rice will be rationed to households starting on the 15th, with a value of about 100 billion yuan for two times. The rationing of rayon and cotton yarn is also worth more than 600 billion yuan. The revenue from commodity tax in recent weeks has been very large. It is heard that the total value of the above has exceeded 10,000 billion yuan. Credit may become tighter in the future, and there is no hope of easing within the week.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Credit was still extremely tight yesterday, with the black market interest rate at 24%. Four banks and two bureaus entered 143.8 billion, the central bank entered 79.3 billion, the large exchange exited 50.1 billion, foreign merchants entered 48.5 billion, the small exchange exited 141.4 billion, the Chinese bank entered 50.4 billion, and other banks and bureaus had no major changes.</p>
<p>Exporting Fine Cloth to Exchange for Indian Cotton Requires a Loss of 70 Rupees. The price of Indian cotton has been rising recently, and the price of exporting yarn and cloth has fallen due to competition from American and Japanese goods. The profit margin of exporting cotton fabrics produced by state-owned and private yarn mills and exchanging them for Indian cotton by local import</p>
<h3>Raising Relief Funds: Quzhou Theater Suggests Charity Performance</h3>
<p>[Our Quzhou Bureau, 8th] In order to manage winter relief in this county, it was decided that all theaters would add a relief donation of one thousand yuan to each ticket. After issuing the order to theaters such as Datong and Dongnan, the organizers of these two theaters believed that adding the relief donation to the ticket would affect business and that it would take a long time to obtain a large sum of money. In order to seize the time and avoid affecting business, they suggested to the authorities that they hold regular performances and donate all ticket revenue to relief efforts. Whether or not this will be adopted is still under consideration by the authorities.</p>
<h3>The Xu Transportation Will Be Restored</h3>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Bureau, 5th Dispatch] The section from Shangqiu to Xuzhou has been progressing slowly due to the lack of railroad ties. It has recently been learned that the Ministry of Communications has allocated 70,000 Canadian fir railroad ties, which are currently being transported from Shanghai to Xuzhou by land. They will be distributed to the construction site for application. The Bian-Xu transportation will be restored soon. Furthermore, in order to protect the railway and strive for transportation safety, the Kaifeng County Government has ordered all townships to take advantage of the winter slack season and, starting on December 1st, to begin repairing and excavating the protective ditches on both sides of the railway from Kaifeng Xinghuaying Station to Zhengzhou Military Station, and to complete this project by the 15th.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Highway Restored with Civilian Labor</h3>
<p>[Our Huizhou Bureau, 6th] The highway from this county to Tunxi was previously requested by the Provincial Government and the Provincial Assembly to the Executive Yuan for allocation of funds for repair. The Executive Yuan then forwarded it to the Ministry of Communications for allocation. The Ministry of Communications replied that the highway funds for this year had already been fully allocated and that, due to limited financial resources, it was impossible to allocate funds. If the Anhui Provincial Government believes that the road needs to be repaired immediately, it may use the agricultural slack season to mobilize civilian labor and raise funds on its own. The Provincial Government also believes that the Tunxi highway, previously surveyed by the Anhui South Affairs Office, has ordered the county government to use civilian labor in the agricultural slack season to repair the road itself as soon as the road line survey is completed.</p>
<h3>From Basin to Plain</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Bureau, 9th] The remnants of the Shaonanling Mountains and the Donggong Mountains stretch along the border of Fujian and Zhejiang, while the Wuyi Mountains intertwine on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, creating the mountainous area of Fujian, a prominent zone in the southeastern coastal mountains. Fuzhou is the largest basin in this mountainous area.</p>
<p>I walked (actually, flew) out of this basin, shook off some of the dust of the mountains and fields, crossed the mountainous border of Fujian and Zhejiang, and returned to Shanghai, the flatland of the plain of the Guo River. As soon as I unloaded my luggage, I stepped onto the banks of the Qiantang River, making a short trip to Hangzhou once again.</p>
<p>On one side are overlapping mountains and ridges, on the other, a vast plain.</p>
<p>Fujian is a relatively mountainous province among the coastal provinces of China. The deep mountains and valleys of northwestern Fujian need not be mentioned. Even Fuzhou, as a basin in the mountains, not only has rolling hills all around, but also has the scenic spots of "Three Mountains" (Yu Mountain, Wushi Mountain, and Ping Mountain) in the city. Because of its mountainous terrain, the geographical environment determines the economic conditions and way of life of the people of Fujian.</p>
<p>When I looked down at the Yangtze River Delta from thousands of feet in the air, I saw crisscrossing rivers and canals, lakes and marshes scattered like stars, and a vast expanse of land where no mountains were visible for hundreds of miles. Even if there was an occasional hill or mound, it was small and isolated, becoming an ornament in the plain. The prosperity of Jiangnan is really bestowed by this lush plain. Fujian's poverty is mostly hindered by its mountainous highlands. Terrain has a great decisive effect on culture and economy.</p>
<p>Fuzhou and Hangzhou are both provincial capitals, garden cities, and park cities.</p>
<p>Fuzhou City is known as a garden-style city because of its flowers, plants, forests, springs, and other scenic features. Fuzhou does indeed have many scenic spots and historical sites. The West Lake of Fuzhou is the former palace of the Tang Dynasty's Min King, and has been carefully carved and landscaped. The scenery is beautiful, but unfortunately it has been neglected for many years, and is overgrown with weeds and duckweed, giving it a desolate feel. Compared with the West Lake in Hangzhou, it pales in comparison.</p>
<p>Although I visited the lake again during the bleak winter season, I still felt that the West Lake had a graceful demeanor, just as the saying goes, "To compare West Lake to Xizi, it is always lovely whether lightly or heavily adorned." Surrounded by green mountains and reflected by the shimmering light and misty shadows, it is truly unforgettable, and it is not an exaggeration to call it a national park.</p>
<p>The Min River is like the Qiantang River, Fuzhou crabs and West Lake lotus roots</p>
<p>The main river of Fujian Province, the Min River, flows through the Fuzhou Basin and serves as the major artery of Fuzhou's transportation. The Qiantang River converges with the Fuchun River, and the Pujiang River flows eastward, irrigating the park city after passing Hangzhou and flowing into Hangzhou Bay.</p>
<p>This time I went to Hangzhou, I did not eat the lotus root of West Lake. Speaking of the lotus root of West Lake, I remembered the crabs of Fuzhou West Lake. Fuzhou crabs are rich and oily, and are very popular with tourists. However, it is said that there are many crabs in times of chaos, and eating too many crabs cannot help but make one worry about the current situation.</p>
<p>Ancestral Brocade Rivers and Mountains: May everyone manage them well</p>
<p>Hangzhou is the center of China's silk weaving industry. What about Fuzhou? Lacquerware is its unique craft and also a manufactured product that can earn foreign exchange.</p>
<p>I saw all kinds of things in the plain area with thousands of miles in sight, and I also thought of the various shapes and colors of the mountains and even the basins. They are all different and have their own characteristics, but these are all the beautiful rivers and mountains left by our ancestors. Let us manage and operate them well!</p>
<h3>Wuwu County Assembly Dispute: Speaker Goes to Hefei to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Wuhu Bureau, 10th Dispatch] Shang Ruilin, speaker of the Wuwei County Assembly, led six assembly members to Hefei yesterday to petition the Anhui Provincial authorities to remove County Magistrate Li Jianwen. More than 20 other assembly members are waiting quietly for Hefei to resolve the county assembly dispute as soon as possible in order to assist the government in stepping up the suppression of bandits in the county. Assembly members have been constantly leaving the county to come to Wuhu in recent days.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Drainage Machine Oil Allocation: Feng Nanhu Embezzles Four Hundred Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The oil used by the drainage machines in this county was previously applied for allocation by the County Assembly to the Shanghai Evacuees Management Committee in order to benefit the farmers. The committee approved the allocation of 265 tons of diesel oil to the Wuxi purchasing agency. However, during the distribution process, it was discovered that Feng Nanhu, the person in charge, had engaged in embezzlement. After being exposed by three general meetings of the assembly, an investigation committee was organized. The assembly has now obtained accurate figures for the original allocation and the actual purchases made by various parties. Feng Nanhu applied for 50 tons in the first application, embezzled 14 tons, embezzled all of the second application, and sold it on the black market in Shanghai. In the third application, he received 150 tons, raised the oil price, and filled his own pockets. The total amount of embezzlement is over 400 million yuan. Feng has now disappeared and the assembly will track down the embezzled funds for verification.</p>
<h3>Quzhou Discovers "Sympathy Society" Leader: Hui Gengshou Has Become a Cobbler</h3>
<p>[Our Quzhou Bureau, 6th Dispatch] In the Yangkou and Hushan towns on the border of Quzhou and Suichang, there is an organization calling itself the "Sympathy Society," which specializes in inciting farmers to resist rent and corvée, using "25% rent reduction" and "resistance to conscription" as slogans. Led by Zeng Gengshou (nicknamed Zeng Laoda) from Dawangyun, Naxiang, Quzhou, he led dozens of people and possessed various weapons, emerging on the border of Quzhou and Suichang to engage in incitement work. On the 3rd of this month, Hui Gengshou entered the city for some business and stayed in Room 5 of the Jinling Hotel. The police, upon receiving the report, arrested the bandit Hui at around 11 PM.</p>
<h3>Fang Jiling Trial Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Bureau, 11th Dispatch] The case of Fang Jiling, former magistrate of Jiangyin County, who was accused of corruption in the grain tax, has been returned for retrial by the Suzhou High Court. The Wu Local Court concluded the trial today and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<p>Taiwan Provincial Research and Experimentation Institutions</p>
<h3>Simplification and Adjustment Plan Has Been Initially Drafted</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Bureau, 8th Dispatch] The two major production pillars of Taiwan, the Industry and Mining Corporation and the Agriculture and Forestry Corporation, have been proposed by Mr. Yang Xuancheng, consultant of the Provincial Government, to merge and reorganize into enterprise companies. The authorities are seriously considering the adjustment and merger of these two provincial institutions, but there are difficulties in terms of business, personnel, production and sales. However, preliminary agreements have been made on the merger of various research institutions. Currently, the provincial research and experimentation institutions include forestry, agriculture, fisheries, sugar, industry, oceanography, geology, and health. After the restoration, the authorities have maintained the status quo of the various research institutions, but due to limited funding, insufficient technical personnel, and poor management, institutions with a long history or a considerable foundation have not been able to operate smoothly, and have not been able to establish close ties with related production institutions, allowing them to go their own way, focusing on ostentation and neglecting the work that should be done. As a result, a reasonable adjustment has not been achieved, and they have not been able to exert their strength in practice. Currently, the authorities have decided to merge the Sugar Experiment Station into the Sugar Corporation, which is jointly run by the Investment Commission and the Provincial Government, the Fisheries Experiment Station into the Fisheries Corporation, and the Jiawo and Hengchun livestock experiment stations of the Agricultural Experiment Station into the Livestock Corporation. The Pingzhen and Yuchi tea experiment farms will be merged into the Tea Company. Recently, agricultural circles here revealed that the simplification and adjustment of this kind of institution is necessary, but academic and production institutions must have organized cooperation, planned and gradual research, avoid duplication, and jointly seek solutions to practical problems, so as to better exert the research effect, which is even more necessary. Enterprise companies aim to make profits. If they proceed from a commercial mentality and prepare for experimental research based on the prosperity and decline of business, it will be a crisis for academic research and will weaken the intense research atmosphere. This point seems to be worthy of the authorities' careful consideration.</p>
<p>New Barracks to Be Built in Minxia</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Bureau, 6th Dispatch] The Ministry of National Defense will improve the treatment of new recruits nationwide and will mobilize local governments to build barracks in various places to accommodate the new recruits of various divisions and regiments. Each barracks unit should be able to accommodate 1,000 people. The Fujian Provincial Government will build three units each in Mawei and Xiamen, which can accommodate a total of 6,000 people, for the use of training new recruits in the North and South Fujian garrison areas. It is reported that the building regulations are tiled roofs, plank walls, and cement floors. The entire project requires 10 billion yuan, which will be raised through donations and borrowing accumulated grain.</p>
<h3>The First District Administrative Conference of Jiangsu Province Successfully Concluded in Danyang</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The First District Administrative Conference of Jiangsu Province successfully concluded in Danyang on the 9th. The following are excerpts from its important resolutions: Request that the bandit suppression troops in the countryside assist the local militia in protecting grain warehouses. Submit a request to the central government to purchase county-level grain in batches, according to local market prices, in order to maintain the budget balance of the county; submit a request to the Provincial Grain Office to issue living allowances and salary increases according to the newly adjusted standards in order to maintain livelihood. Telegraph the Provincial Government that the budgets of various counties should be approved by the counties themselves based on the county's political situation, and should be based on income and expenditure, and should not be increased or decreased too much, so as not to make it impossible for the county government to implement them. The telephones in the villages and towns of various counties should be connected as soon as possible in order to facilitate communication and security. Strengthen the fortifications of cities and towns and along the river, and the military section or military instructor of each county should be responsible for the design. Submit a request to the Provincial Government to allow the restoration of the military sections of various counties that have been abolished in order to facilitate the suppression of bandits. Due to the thin police force in various counties, submit a request to the Provincial Department to establish volunteer police in various places based on local conditions. The rest are omitted.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Hotel Tea Waiters Trained and Organized into Auxiliary Police</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Bureau, 9th Dispatch] In order to strengthen public security and prevent petty activities, the Suzhou Police Department has decided to immediately prepare to assemble and train tea waiters in various public places such as hotels and bookstores in the urban area, and after giving them some training, organize them into auxiliary police and return them to their original service places to assist the military and police in winter defense work at any time.</p>
<h3>Watching White Plays, Major Fight, Detaining Bandits, We Will Deal with Them Strictly</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Bureau, 10th Dispatch] The Changyuan Theater in Zhoushanbang, this county, has recently been performing "The Civet Cat Exchanged for the Prince." On the evening of the 7th of this month, not long after the performance began, a mob of "Thirty-Six Gang" did not purchase tickets and forced their way into the theater. When they were stopped by the ticket collectors, a dispute occurred and led to a major melee involving more than 1,000 people, injuring three audience members. Residents in the area fled in panic. Military police authorities and the entire city's self-defense force went to suppress the situation with guns and ammunition, and finally the situation calmed down. Five gang members of the "Thirty-Six Gang," including Pan Guirong, Fan Ya'fu, Li Youliang, Xu Honglou, and Xiao Dazhang, were arrested on the spot and sent to the police inspector's office for legal action. However, the main members of the gang are still plotting to stir up trouble. The county government has sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and has ordered the arrest of the remaining gang members and their strict punishment.</p>
