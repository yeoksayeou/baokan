<h3>經濟委會討論物價疏通糧源恢復指數　滬市工資調整辦法通過</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕全國經濟委會物價委會，十日上午九時在政院舉行第六次例會，出席王雲五·兪鴻鈞·兪大維·谷正綱·徐堪·張嘉璈·吳國楨·沈怡·甘乃光·龐松舟·陳克文等，張院長羣主席，關於糧食部份，經決定：（一）切實保障正當糧商米店，使能照常營業。（二）嚴禁各地機關禁運，使糧食可以自由流通，盈虛互劑，其有藉故阻撓或乘機勒索者，一律嚴行懲辦。（三）內地糧源設法暢通，使川·湘·皖等省餘糧得供應京·滬等地。關於上海市工人工資問題，經將社會部所呈上海市工資調整暫行辦法修正通過。</p>
<p>〔又電〕十日經濟委員會物值會議修正通過上海市工資調整暫行辦法如下：（一）自三十六年五月份起，各業工人工資，按月根據指數分別依本辦法計算發給。（二）底資絕對不得變更，其在經濟緊急措施方案實施後，已有變動者，應回復原數。（三）底資在三十元以下者，依照指數十足發給。（四）底資在三十元以上至一百元者，除三十元照指數十足發給外，其餘部分以每十元爲一級，逐級遞减百分之十之折扣。（五）資方如因生產及營業情况不佳，確難負擔，不能照本辦法三至五條規定發給工資者，得由勞資雙方協議减少之，如協議不能成立時，由勞資評斷會評斷之。（六）在本辦法公布以前，各業勞資雙方對依照指數發給工資折扣辦法，已自有協定者，得依其協定。（七）本辦法實施之日起，配售實物之差額金貼補即行停止。</p>
<p>當局考慮憑證購糧軍糧配額逐步減少</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕聞政府中有一部份人士主張，用憑證購糧辦法，處理目前糧食問題。張院長日昨於參政會報吿時，亦曾指出拋售辦法之不當，並謂政府擬擴大糧食配售範圍，使警察，工人，平民均有購買糧食機會，而憑證購米辦法，實為擴大配售最有效之辦法。據稱，憑證購物制，雖以適用於戰時為宜，然英倫及香港迄今仍予沿用。此制普遍在我國實行，在技術上固不無需要硏討之處，然在目前情况下，欲謀糧價平抑並消弭各地米潮，此實爲唯一有效辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕中糧公司總經理談該公司計劃稱：擬於全國設四個據點，以普遍調劑有無，一在長沙，以調劑粤漢路而至廣州，一設無錫，以調劑京滬，一設蕪湖，以調劑東北華北，一設九江，以調劑西南。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕全國軍糧之配額，五月份已較四月減少五分之一。此後仍將逐漸减少，俾免影饗民食。</p>

<p>〔又電〕馬占山將軍久爲東北人民所信仰，前僞滿軍之被共軍改編者，對伊允多崇拜。此次馬將軍任職東北，共軍下級幹部難免不因此發生變化，呂正操，張學詩等特於上月廿日召集各軍區司令員及政委共百餘人，在南崗偽松江省府開會，由李立三主席，討論阻止馬部反正詳細辦法。（一）將馬氏舊部及所屬人員兵力澈底調査，加以監視。（二）通令所屬地區前方部隊密切注意，幷嘉獎査獲有反正事實者之官兵。另據某熟悉東北情形者云：北滿一帶馬將軍舊部當在卅萬以上。</p>

<h3>中共民主份子展開反毛運動</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕自毛澤東一意孤行發動內亂以來，中共內部民主份子，已展開激烈之反毛運動，堅決反對毛澤東武裝打天下的政策，並要求毛氏終止左傾機會主義的鬥爭。此項反毛遝動之宣傳文字，各地迭有發現，茲又接獲署名「中國共產黨非常委員會蘇魯皖邊區黨務委員會宣傳部」印發之「四季歌」一種，曲按民謠孟姜女調，對毛澤東逞兵作亂，禍國殃民之憎恨，表現無遺，茲錄其原詞如下：</p>
<p>（一）春季裏來砲火紅，中國出了毛澤東，爭權奪利私心大，害得人民不安寗。</p>
<p>（二）夏季裏來大戰開，多少民兵當砲火，毛賊一心打天下，不管百姓受兵災。</p>
<p>（三）秋季裏來大禍臨，八路新四又調兵，可憐一仗犧牲大，人民遭殃好痛心。</p>
<p>（四）冬季裏來鬧災荒，人民飢餓苦難當，只要同心反毛賊，安居樂業大家亭。</p>

<h3>中菲促麥帥加重壓力　迫令日交出掠奪物　美反對以日資產作佔領費</h3>
<p>〔聯合社日本西部調査「掠奪物資」列車上十日電〕中國及菲律濱代表今日聯合促請麥帥總部加重壓力，迫令日本將戰時掠奪之財產交還各國。中國駐日代表團賠償組組長吳半農稱二日本向國際調査員報吿之戰利品，迄今僅及中國在日軍佔領期內所受損失之表面，麥帥應繼續努力，並對日本加重壓力，迫其交出菲律濱代表團賠償委員會生席阿勃萊拉提議麥帥對於日本掠奪之財產應嚴令歸還。根據數星期來在日本旅行時所見，知日本對於交還財產命令，並未切實遵行，其他各國代表亦表示同樣意見，盟國被日本　據之船隻不下一千五百艘，現僅査出七十艘。據中國官員稱：日本自中國掠奪之船隻一百二十艘，僅已交還四艘、英國所失不下一千三百艘，僅有一艘歸還，日方所報吿之七十艘，內有若干業已沉沒，但尙可打撈。其中一　爲英國萬噸貨輪，在本州北海岸撈起，另一艘爲載重一萬八千噸之義大利輪船康脫凡第號，亦在同一港口內擱淺。該輪於一九四三年在上海由義大利船員　沉，後經日人撈起使用。</p>
<p>〔合衆社大阪十日電〕據吳半農談：渠要求盟軍總部加施更大之壓力，並搜査博物院，圖書館及私人收集，因此等塲所又能爲劫掠品藏匿之處，現已査獲者有造紙廠及硝酸廠各一，不久即將運回中國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕據外交界靈通方面本日消息：遠東委員會不久即將宣佈，決核准美國之申請，反對以日本現行資產作爲抵付佔領費用及償付糧食救濟之用。按美國對於此舉已在遠東委員會中奮鬥數月之久，務期該委員會核准美國之申請。</p>
<p>盟國調查團將搜尋日皇宮壕溝內贓物</p>
<p>〔合衆社本州南岸專車十日電〕據現在日本南部之盟國調査團代表吿記者稱：當局或將挖撈東京皇宮四週之壕溝，尋覓日軍在戰期內曾否在該處藏匿金銀及其他刧掠品，。盟方現正進行大規模之搜査工作，尋覓數十億美元之刧掠物品，此項刧掠物係日人在戰期內奪自各盟國者，諒仍藏匿於日本境內。挖壕之舉即爲搜査工作之一部。日人曾奉命繳出此項物品，但盟方官員相信迄今僅收到一小部份，若干調査團代表主張用地雷搜索器搜尋陸上贓物，蓋此法在德境頗著成效。</p>
<p>蘇聯此次未派代表參加調査團，諉稱目前並無準備。中·美·英·法·加拿大·澳洲·菲律濱及荷蘭等代表則已啓程赴日本南部，均贊成在佔領期內，繼續竭力搜尋，蓋對日和約一經簽訂之後，事前未曾指明之任何物品絕少取回之望云。</p>
<h3>對日本賠償問題　吳半農談我需要　希望獲立可應用之物資</h3>
<p>〔合衆社大阪十日電〕中國駐日代表團賠償組組長吳半晨博士頃談稱：「中國希望自日本現行生產中提取賠償，中國需要自日本獲得立即可以應用之物資，除食糧以外，中國並希望立即獲得一切日用品，作爲中國所應得之一部分賠款，如布疋，火車頭，鋼軌，及日本工廠所生產之其他物資。」</p>
<p>吳博士認爲日本決不能償付所規定之全部賠款。渠亦知必須允許日本維持相當低之生活水準。吳氏續稱：在目前可用作賠款之工廠中，中國所需要者爲動力工廠，五金工具，工廠，船塢及化學工廠，賠償所得之工廠當根據中美專家所擬定之五年計劃，分配於全國各地。中國賠償代表團曾參觀若干工廠，發現此中頗有對中國毫無價値者，反之，若干工廠則具有無上價値，但中國缺少船隻裝運此等工廠返國。</p>
<p>中國對盟軍總部臨時賠款單內僅列有少數五十次週率之發電廠，甚感失望，日本可同時採用五十次週率與六六十次週率之電力工，廠而中國則以五十次週率爲標準。中國需要若于此項工廠，但可應用者爲數太少，事實上無選擇可言。</p>
<p>中國幷需要輾鐵廠，以彌補蘇聯在東北搬走之　山鋼鐵廠，中國正在草擬賠款單，但鑒於中國受日本之損失太鉅，一時難以估計，故工作甚爲困難。</p>
<p>國亟願與盟軍總部協力安定日本經濟，現正計劃以物物交換之方式，以煤，焦炭及鐵鑛苗供給日本，換取日本之鋼鐵製成品，希望此項貿易在短期內可吿完成。</p>
<h3>我赴日五人小組定名賠償代表團</h3>

<p>據財政部發言人稱：目前政府正考慮修改前所頒布之經濟緊急措施方案，其草案，並已由經財等有關部會會商擬訂中。證以行政院張院長前曾表示，認爲此項方案，已不甚適合。必須加以修正，則上項消息，自屬信而有徵。</p>
<p>所謂經濟措施方案，其內容包括甚廣。究竟何種部份不甚適合，卽何種部份，必須加以修改，未經當局說明，自不便加以懸揣。惟細加尋繹，有頒行之初，已覺不甚適合者，如二十七年修正公布之非常時期農礦工商管理條例，全屬軍事時期所定經濟動員辦法。其中所定各項企業應興應廢，應官辦，應民營，以及如何扶導，管制等項，規定甚爲周密。現在內亂未平，軍事時期，雖未完全過去。但政府對於上項措施，顯然並無準備，亦並無任何機關具有施行上項措施之權能與實力，徒然一紙空文，責令「嚴格執行，」其結果，當然不過一紙空文而已　此其一。</p>
<p>有大體尙屬良好，而其中條文，顯已失去時間性者，如各項罰則，規定價値五萬元以上之案件，移歸法院處理，而不滿五萬元者，由主管機關依法處罰。按諸現時物價，價値五萬元以下之案件，恐已絕無僅有，則一切連反限價議價，囤積居奇等案件，無問鉅細，非一律移送司法不可，顯與當時立法之原意不符，此其二。</p>
<p>有事實上之準備，迄今尙未完全就緒者，例如民生日用重要必需品之定量分配，依法，凡職工及公敎人員，皆應照額配售。現在京滬兩地之公敎人員，雖已照案實施，但職工之定量分配，猶在折發差金之中。今以購米困難之故，各商廠及職工，皆渴望配售實物，斷非徒恃差金所能應付。然而物資供應機關，對於是項物資，究竟已否充分準備，能否依法供應，迄尙無明白表示，此其三。</p>
<p>有客觀條件不具，實際已無法繼續施行者，如生活指數之凍結，本以穩定物價爲先決條件。今以物價步漲，生活艱苦，各地職工，皆力求指數之解凍。此項原則，卽在資方及當局，亦未嘗不認其爲合理。則規定一月份指數爲最高額一點，實際已失其控制力，此其四。</p>
<p>有限制過嚴，工商停滯，不得不迅籌補救者，如關於發展貿易事項中所定外匯申請及輸入許可等條款。「若干原料品及機器之進口，爲國內工業所必需」者，本皆在許可之列。但是項進口之許可，及外匯之申請，實際上非常困難。致進出口業進退維谷，而廠家原料之接濟，尤屬萬分焦慮，此其五。</p>
<p>原來經濟緊急措施各項方案，其所以不甚適合，必須加以修改者，除掉立法本身上之缺點以外，還有人爲的，卽執行上亦欠圓滿。舉幾個例子，如限價議價之不恰當，及取締囤積之手續欠缺等，本報業已另文指出。所以簡單地說：此項緊急措施之未能收效，一半是先天的，卽其本身扞格太多，一半由後天的，卽推行未能切實，亦可說：有許多部分，根本並未認眞辦理。</p>
<p>何以並未認眞辦理！其原因亦有種種，而立法太密，太不合理，亦是其中主因之一。譬如取締囤積居奇條例所載，凡商人之一舉一動，幾無不須登記，報吿。而一切貨物，除左手進來，右手卽須出去之外，又幾乎無往而非囤積。如果積存未動，非由政府定價收買或代賣，卽須指定地點，勒令運銷。照此規定，則市塲上所稱充實存底，合法利潤等語，在此時代，幾乎無可適用。</p>
<p>所以修改現行方案，必須把握住幾個要點：（一）必須求其合理，卽合乎人情，適應事實。凡屬生吞活剝，過淤主觀的硬性規定，無論如何嚴厲，終不會推行盡利。卽使勉强施行，其結果，亦無非陽奉陰違，造成許多罪惡。（二）必須簡單易行。凡一切不必要的手續，和並無實用的節目，務須儘量汰除，使商民樂於遵從，官廳易於奉行。我國民情，習於簡易，樂於寬大，加以幅員遼闊，風尙各殊，斷不宜囿於京滬兩地之見聞，閉門造車，但憑臆測，至令法令悉成具文，商民益增痛苦。（三）必須當機立斷。如生活指數之解凍問題，公敎人員待遇之調整問題，民食問題，進出口問題等，皆已箭在弦上，不容不酌予改善以迅赴事機。如遲回審顧，多所遷延，或至治絲益棼，多生枝節。而結果仍不得不順應風流，以　衆望，徒損政府之威　而已。至於一切苛擾辦法，及與民爭利等政策，尤望澈底沙汰，與民更始，以期同德一心，共渡此經濟上之難關。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社社華盛頓十日電〕衆院通過援希土法案之翌日，此間消息靈通人士宣稱，今後美國外交政策不僅在利用美國貸款以供希臘與土耳其建設，並在關閉中東對蘇聯之門戶。衆院之表決象徵國會準備充分支持馬歇爾國務卿在莫斯科會議時所推行之堅決政策。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓九日合衆電〕衆院民主黨議員對某議員所作「若蘇聯認爲援助土希法案爲「宣戰」，則亦聽之而已」一語，大加贊許。按此一言論，係共和黨議員外委會委員茂羅於衆院討諭修正防共法案之第二日會議中所發表者。</p>

<h3>全市各區衛生事務所　醫師護士呈請辭職　衛生局長分別勸勉慰留　表示將氏向市長力爭待遇問題</h3>

<h3>郵工生活同感艱困</h3>
<p>工會理事長談話</p>
<p>上海郵務工會理事長王震　，昨就國際電台員工「餓工」及要求與郵局同樣待遇事，發表談話稱：國際電台工友爲爭取合法的生活權利而「餓工」，本人深表同情，並祝望其早日獲得合理解決。至目前郵政人員待遇，決非如外界所傳，目前待遇如米貼，實物差金等，絕未超越政府法令規定之範圍，生活指數亦自本年一月份起同遭凍結。最近物價在漲，郵工生活亦已瀕臨絕境云。</p>

<h3>梅斯伯案上訴審結　荷美外交官均到庭旁聽　諭定十七日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕荷蘭商人梅斯伯，違法經營黑市外匯外幣案，經地院判處有期徒刑一年，梅與檢察官均不服，提起上訴，於三日已一度審訊。昨晨在高院開言詞辯論庭。荷蘭總領事密特而登，大使館商務參贊司帶克，美國領事安德生，非萊區，法律顧問張天蔭，均到庭旁聽。九時卅分劉毓桂庭長偕韓述之，王可權推事及駱檢察官升座刑一庭，審訊達四小時之久，庭諭：本案審結，定十七日上午宣判。</p>
<p>昨日首由梅之辯護人陳霆銳律師聲明上訴理由業已於昨日呈遞鈞院，並將副本呈案供參考。梅之供述與前相同，港幣二萬元係押匯保證金，黄金卅八條係聯信公司所寄存，埃勃斯公司幷未經營銀行業務，對原判表示不服。駱檢察官之論吿略謂：被吿雖稱港幣二萬元，幷非存款，而爲雷峨公司之保設金，但　朱經該公司到案證明，故應斷定其爲存款，依財部條例，應視同銀行，原審之引據，幷無不當。原審以被吿爲外國人士，不諳中國法律，而從輕處斷，實爲不當，應請撤消原判，更爲適當之判決。嗣由陳霆銳，蔡汝楝兩律師起立辯護，引經據典，闡述甚詳，要點略謂：（一）經濟緊急措施方案內處罰部份尙未完成法律程序，不能遽即視同法律。（二）即使在未經立法院完成法律程序前果可視爲法律，其在滬發生效力之時間應爲三月五日零時，而本案事實之發生，遠在三月三日以前。警備部搜査埃勃斯公司，在三月三日下午。（三）原判決朱盡調査之能事，竟指埃勃斯公司爲銀行，故入人罪，有失法治精神。（四）沒收外幣部分，並非爲買賣或交易所收付之標的，依法不應予以沒收。末請，糾正下級法院錯誤，將原判撤消，對上訴人爲無罪之判決。</p>
<h3>地產大王窘態畢露　孫春生漢奸嫌疑案堅不承認募款購機</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敵僞時期上海地產大王孫春生漢奸嫌疑案，昨在高院受審。孫四十七歲，浙江餘姚人，住惇信路一八七號，向業地產。於民國卅二年六月任僞上海特別市房地產業同業公會常務理事兼秘書長，幷任日敵信交地產株式會社華經理。於民國卅三年四月間僞南京政府在本市國際飯店召集各業公會，募款購機，該會認捐僞幣廿二萬五千元。勝利後經淞滬警備司令部拘送高院法辦。孫昨受鞫時着藍綢夾袍，時露奸滑笑容，對起訴書中所控僞職承認不諱。對於募款購機堅不承認。惟已經上海市政府調査處査明確有其事，復經中統局上海特派員辦事處査明，被吿藉乃師朱博泉之援引，與日寇頗多往來，始擔任信交株式會社華經理，嗣任僞地產公會理事兼秘書長，時爲日人佔據地產，曾利用職權，向全市地產商募集鉅款，購機獻鐵。經丁推事嚴詰後，被吿頗露窟態。審訊時間頗久，以尙需調査，諭知改期再審，被吿還押。</p>
<h3>商聯工協昨舉行座談會討論經濟改劃實施問題</h3>
<p>全國商業聯合會及中國工業協會，爲討論經濟改革方案實施問題，昨日下午三時假林森中路中聯招待所邀集有關各界舉行座談會。出席金潤庠·胡西園·徐永祚·壽景偉·魏友桀·孫曉村·陶桂林·兪寰澄·張孟昭·劉志方等數十人。首由主席壽景偉致開會詞，對於經濟改革方案所列各原則，逐條詳細分析。並特別着重下列三點：（一）民生主義爲建國張本，利用龐大人力參加生產，實爲急需，而施政之要，立信為本，當局今後應注重於挽回其信譽。（二）保護工業利潤，訂立全盤計劃。由日本拆遷之工廠，除政府必需者外，應交由各業承辦。國內敵僞產業，亦應從速租與民營。（三）停辦徵借糧食，創立常平倉庫，以根本安定社會。繼由兪寰澄致詞，略謂：政府以往所注重者爲黨政軍，而未嘗加意於農工商，故農工商之痛苦，政府亦常有隔膜，以往屢次決議扶助工商業，結果均背道而馳，不知黨政軍乃消耗者，晨工商則爲生產者，其地位遠較黨政軍重要。爲培養國家根基着想，政府必須改變以往之觀念，把基本政策弄淸楚，以扶助工商業爲前提。經濟學家孫曉村致詞，渠對於經濟改革方案提出四點意見：（一）方案本身缺少一先決原則，（二）機構本身未提到，（三）增發通貨不應放寬於消耗方面，而緊縮於生產方面，（四）各項管制禁令必須放寬。申新紗廠代表張孟昭報吿紡織界種種困難情形，認爲目前當局限價，不及實際成本一半，如不獲改善，工商界實難維持。徐永祚會計師表示政府一切管制，直接間接均在摧殘生產事業，希望政府多行王道政策。使人民獲蘇息機會。關於生活指數解凍問題，渠認爲解凍雖爲合理辦法，但一般工人之底薪，大致已較戰前提高四五倍，亦應使其回復原狀，始稱公允。至於平穩經濟，渠認爲目下物價，高漲倍數，事實上已超過通貨膨脹比例，故主張由政府發行「物價指數庫劵」，使幣値獲得保障後，人民不再囤積，政府則以所吸收之游資，低利貸放，供生產事業之用。此外，王克·注劍平·金潤庠·陶桂林·李軔哉·陳調甫等亦相繼致詞，對於指數解凍，經濟政策，工商組織及訓練等問題討論甚爲熱烈。最後決議即日進行組織金融工商兩委員會，及職業靑年訓練班，以便硏究問題及訓練靑年，並決定各組委員以十五人爲限云。</p>

<h3>羣芳譜　竹籃和興公園蒔花展覽千紅萬紫鬥艷爭姸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蒔花展覽會，於昨日下午五時，在復興公園舉行揭幕　，參加花店計五十餘　位，陳列鮮花不下二千餘種。</p>
<p>有許多種類花，都是名貴異常，不可多見的。諸如：毛地黄，麒麟角，石榴紅，三角花，君子蘭，杜鵑花，瓜叶菊，蒲包花……等等。奇花異草，萬紫千紅，展覽會顯然曾下過一番佈置工夫的。園塲管理處處長徐天錫，昨天已經精疲力盡，顧問程世撫也因疲勞過度，發了高熱。程小姐也忙啞了嗓子。展覽會確實是漂亮的，扎花，扦花，盆景，插瓶……每一類都有它特殊的引誘力，色澤調和，排列美化，無不引人入勝。</p>
<p>許多花卉之中，以三角花最爲別緻，顏色也最好看，是淡淡的玫瑰紅，花瓣呈三角形，生長得極爲緊密。綠色的葉子，比花瓣更小，所以遠遠望去，唯見一片粉紅色。據說這原是杜鵑花中之一種，而是屬於名貴的一類。</p>
<p>毛地黄的樣子，雖像一隻倒懸的鐘，亦像是樂隊裏的大喇叭，它與吊鐘海棠並置在一起，就成了鐘的世界了。</p>
<p>金黄的鳶尾，和潔白的百合，雖然平凡，但是被安插在同一花瓶中，便顯得格外討人喜歡，正如睡蓮躺在扶郎花旁邊，更形嬌嫩了。</p>
<p>罌粟花該是萬惡的，然而它鮮艷奪目的色彩，却遠勝康納馨。</p>
<p>赴蒔花展覽會觀光一番，可以讓你暫時忘却塵間的煩腦。據說園塲管理處準備每年舉行兩次鮮花展覽會，上半年是藤花，下半年是菊花。不化大錢，而有益身心，該不失爲生活上良好的調劑。</p>
<p>園塲管理處並定於十二日下午四時，在復興公園舉行插花此賽，該處備有大小花瓶百餘隻，鮮花數十種，任憑參加者自動排選，請名家担任評判。已向該處報名參加者，有聖約翰，南通，震旦等各大學女生及各界婦女二十餘名，其名單如下：朱汝功（女醫師）謝采琴（名畫家謝閒鷗之女）朱志敏（名畫家陶冷月之婦弟子）葛允怡（葛敬恩之女）黄敏宜，林寬洪，萬彥芳，王霞絢，黄妙玲，唐股靜（以上係聖約翰農學院女生）黄貞詰，唐其慧，任家珩，高慧淸（以上係南通大學女生）吳國珍（震且女生）</p>

<p>田次長談話</p>
<p>敎次田培林十日談英大問題時稱：英大學生一再要求遷校，雖迭經解釋，猶復狃於積習，聚衆要挾，長途詰願，竟至妨碍交通，滋擾社會，本部正在力謀整飭學風之時，絕不容其挾衆堅持，稍事姑息。現杭次長及周司長等，已先後赴杭開導，灤盼該批學生。從速悔悟返校上課，不可輕舉妄動，陷於錯誤，而不自覺。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十日電〕停頓已達三日二夜之滬杭鐵路，今晚即可通車。</p>
<p>沈主席勸導</p>
<p>英大五百餘請願學生，接愛沈主席鴻烈之再三勸導，爲顧全旅客福利，並避免誣指破壞交通之嫌，故撤離鐵路綫，向晚自筧僑由省府派車分批接回杭州，住浙大農學院，再與敎部總績商討。路局巳派員將昨經破壞之路軌修復，並準備車頭，今晚可有二次專車開滬，以救旅客之急。蓋一部旅客，因盤川已盡，今集衆向省府行總請願，現已由行總爲之向各商號籌募，予以救濟。</p>

<p>英大學生發表聲明</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十日電〕英士大學學生，經杭次長接談後，學生方面發表聲明，謂滬杭路交通，非彼等所破壞，乃交通部與敎育部所破壞，現學生已由鐵路撤至杭州華家祠農學院，再度與杭次長交涉。滬杭路交通綫讓出後，交通恢復與否，乃路局之事。據學生方面對記者談：對於遷校問題，是前校長楊公達之主張，現見報載楊發表言論，致引起學生方面奇怪，對楊一致表示憤怒。又據悉：滬杭路明或可連車。</p>
<p>英大前校長談遷校問題</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕金華國立英士大學學生要求遷校以來，頗爲各方注意，記者特趨訪該校前校長楊公達據談稱：「自本人於去年八月底奉命任該校校長以來，在金華積極修理校舍，延聘敎授辦理招生，舉辦學校復原等工作於十一月廿日業照計劃開學上課，數月以還蒙部撥款充實學校設備，大量採辦圖書儀器，幷自動發電，故設備方面，較他校亦不爲差，永久校舍亦蒙部准分期興建，飭囑就地勘測不幸本人氣喘病發，久治不愈，因體力不支，乃獲部准辭去，並派工學院院長周尙代理後，聞學生請求遷校，擬來京請願，不勝惋惜，惟該校基礙甫定，建築永久校舍，籌劃伊始，希望英大同學洞悉本校努力所在，顧全學業，體念敎育部愛護之至意，攻讀如常，本校幸甚，至於本人因病不克繼續在校工作，負咎至深。</p>
<h3>交大學生昨罷課日內將晉京請願　校門內外遍貼標語指摘敎部歧視</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國立交通大學學生，因反對敎育部撤銷該校航海輪機兩科，反對敎育部擬將該校理學院及管理學院停辦而改爲純粹之交通工程學院，羣情憤激，已於昨日起，開始罷課，表示抗議。校門內外，到處遍貼標語漫畫，聲稱：「交大不容歧視，交大不容分割」。學生組織之護校團，並油印「快報」聯絡同學，報吿工作進行情形，截至昨日下午，已有四十二級同學一千五百餘人，簽名加入護校團。全體同學準備日內晉京請願，途中組織將以每十人爲一小隊，每五小隊爲一中隊，女同學另組一隊。交通工具問題，該團負責人昨已分頭向火車輪船汽車三方面接洽，據悉：輪船方面已有某大輪船公司允予協助。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕交大學生自治會，定今日（十一日）下午二時，在徐家匯該校恭綽館十二號，招待本市記者，將報吿罷課經過情形。據該會負責人云：「爲了敎育部的歧視交大，除停辦航海輪機兩科以外，並擬將已開辦的水利與紡織兩系，勒令停辦。且據朱部長言：交大應絕對屬於工程學校，故理學院與管理學院，亦將加以調整。至於經費比他校少得多，已是事實了，因此我們決定於九日起罷課，並將晋京請願」。</p>
<p>交大吳校長　談赴京交涉經過</p>
<p>〔中央社訊〕據交大吳保　校長談：此次本人晋京，爲向敎育部請示辦理輪機航海兩科事，敎部以該兩科原爲重慶商船專科學校委託本校辦理，復員後該校業已恢復，故於去年暑期歸併，即將新生送至該校。原有兩科高年級生則仍留在本校，繼續辦理，至畢業爲止。至欲將該兩科改系，則於學制不合。因輪機航海，純係技術訓練，毋須在大學辦系，因各國無此先例。若謂交通大學行將另改名稱，理學院及管理學院行將取消等傳說，敎部並無此項言論。</p>
<h3>埠際足球賽　上海勝香港　二比一滬隊後來居上上半時雙方未開紀錄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬港本季第二次埠際足球大賽，滬港兩軍昨日下午四時半會師逸園，作本市勝利後首次盛大之埠際大賽。上海隊賴堅强無匹之守衛綫，銳利之鋒綫，卒以二比一擊敗港隊，奪回埠際盃，報復農膠新正在港之敗辱，上半時零比零未開紀錄。昨日憲軍警努力維持秩序，故情形尙佳，觀衆約計萬五千人，門劵總共售出九千餘張。警察樂隊到塲奏樂，情諸相當熱烈。雙方大軍列陣如下：</p>
<p>上海隊</p>
<p>麥尼蒂　嚴士鑫　吳祺祥　韓龍波　鐵伏尼　高保正　李垚　孫錦順　受德華　韓龍海　福恩</p>
<p>香港隊</p>
<p>格拉斯克　謝錦洪　侯榕生　馮坤勝　却利　劉松生　曹秋亭　鄒文治　蕭理爾　沙利文　謝錦河</p>
<p>戰局大勢</p>
<p>戰情始終緊張，惟精彩則不多，上半時雙方未開紀錄，且受傷者甚衆，港隊曹秋亭首先足踝受傷離塲，繼之爲滬隊福恩，韓龍海，雙方實力，不無影響。滬隊昨日得勝，後衛功居大半，港鋒雖勇，三關難渡，徒喚奈何，高保正滿塲飛奔，嚴士鑫穩健可靠，前鋒合作稍差，福恩受傷，老孫速度大减，昨日得勝，頗非易事。港隊守衛，不如滬隊，前鋒雖强，不能攻破滬隊防綫，終遭屈服也。</p>
<p>受傷累累</p>
<p>裁判何春暉，巡邊員吳守衡陳吉祥，四時半大戰展開，比賽採英國制，不能調人，滬隊開球，首取攻勢，愛德華中路疾進，受阻於却利，蕭惠爾單騎深入，嚴士鑫大意錯過，幸麥尼蒂衝出，未肇鉅禍。五分鐘時，沙利文爭球與嚴士鑫互撞，頭部受傷，包紥後重行入塲，滬隊進攻，俱未得手。十三分鐘時，港隊五鋒並進，沙利文深入，幸嚴士鑫剷出，化險爲夷，二分鐘後，曹秋亭與謝錦洪兩翼齊飛，滬隊門前，險象環生，至十九分鐘時，曹秋亭脚踝受傷下塲，港隊以十人應戰。</p>
<p>罰籬笆球</p>
<p>廿三分鐘時，港軍門將持球走步，被判籬笆球，由福恩主罰，龍海接球射門，操之過急，良機坐失。至卅分鐘時，龍海亦以脚踝抽筋下塲，雙方同剩十人，混戰至卅五分鐘時，韓龍海重行進場，而福恩則以腿部舊創復發退出，上半時終，鴨蛋一雙</p>
<p>港軍破城</p>
<p>易地再戰，客軍仍以十人出塲，滬隊福恩重行登塲，中　開球港軍整兵疾進，沙利文與鄒文洽聯絡默契，薰惠爾冷路竄出，吳祺祥阻擋不及，麥尼蒂撲救稍遲，竟入網窠，一比〇港軍先報捷音。滬隊痛失一城，心有不甘，三軍疾進，奈侯榕生與却利防守嚴密，無隙可乘。</p>
<p>龍海二中</p>
<p>至九分鐘時，孫鐵腿落後帶球，遙傳左角，李垚輕輕一吊，球落港軍門前，韓將軍從天而降，迎頭一頂，格拉斯克不防此著，遂吿失守，一比一滬隊扳成和局。之後，滬隊士氣旺盛，港軍腹地備遭蹂躪，愛德羣福恩韓龍海等迭有攻門機會，格拉斯克忙碌異常。至十八分鐘時，孫錦顧與韓龍海開始圍剿，龍海獲空擋機會，趕上一脚，二比一再進一球，滬隊反敗爲勝，四座爆竹齊鳴，歡聲雷動。港軍見勢不佳，傾力反攻，沙利文蕭惠爾鄒文治等迭有妙射，非爲野逸，即被麥尼蒂接住，雙方混戰至終塲前一刻鐘時，均有疲態，法定時間吿終，滬隊以二比一反敗爲勝</p>

<h3>蔣主席關懷本市民食　電令保護正當糧商　昨米店大多復業但無貨應市</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日本市發生搶米事件多起，米商遂多閉門停業。市府頃接奉蔣主席關於糧食問題之電令，諭囑對正當糧商辦理糧食之購銷，各處地方行政機關應予保護及便利。市府奉令後，當轉飭警察社會兩局並函淞滬警備司令部査照。一面又通知該業公會轉飭同業，並在南北兩市塲張貼佈吿，囑安心營業，勿稍驚慌，以維民食。對配撥之平價米糧，尤不得藉故隱匿或破壞限價，對於白粳一項，亦不得高抬市價囤積居奇。</p>
<p>社局昨拋萬八千包</p>
<p>昨日各米店開門者，已較前日為多，推米櫃內大多無貨。南市塲交易停頓，北市塲則到貨三二六八石。白粳高貨喊三十萬元，中貨廿九萬元，次貨廿七萬五千元，薄稻高貨廿九萬五千元，中貨廿九萬元，次貨廿八萬元。早稻高貨廿八萬元，中貨廿七萬五千元。羊秈高貨廿九萬元，中貨廿八萬元，次貨廿七萬五千元。碾秈高貨廿七萬元，中貨廿六萬五千元。埠秈高貨廿七萬五千元，中貨廿七萬元，次貨廿六萬四千元。白元高貨卅萬五千元，中貨廿九萬五千元，次貨廿八萬五千元，陰元中貨廿九萬五千元，社會局因米商於八日請願時拒受九千包之配米，昨日實行補配，故總共拋出一萬八千包。價仍爲十四萬七千元。</p>
<p>開市米店秩序良好</p>
<p>南市塲昨晨曾發現一紅約黑字之標語，係一部份米商所貼，內容甚爲刺激。社會局糧食科長吉明齊至市塲發現後，即將其取去，以免滋事。據吉科長語記者：渠曾於昨日上午巡視各區米號，全市二千二百四十家中已有三分之二開業，但大多無貨應市。其一部份有米供應者，則秩序良好，並無爭購現像。相信至十二日（星期一）全市各米號即可全部恢復營業</p>

<p>外股昨隨華股同榮辱，開出即吿躍升。錢兌業及散戶雖賣，證劵帮力加補進，北帮及廣帮亦納，形成求過於供。怡紗自晨開見昂至六五〇〇〇元後，曾退爲六二五〇〇元而後盤，升至六七五〇〇元始稍回落。港申電仍報十八元有零，結果較前收計會德豐開平懇植微升，業廣稍降，電話航業怡啤升一成，鋼業漲成半，怡紗英聯紙業各好二成。</p>
<h3>統債平淡</h3>
<p>公債昨頗平和，起仆有限。統丙自北帮及一一九室五五〇室購買，自一三〇〇〇元開後，盤上至一四五〇〇元左右結束。五〇三室五〇七室則出，成交約五百餘萬，結果較前收計甲乙各升九百元，丙丁亦漲八百元，統戊亦好起五百元。</p>
<h3>四種公債中籤號碼</h3>
<p>財政部公債司昨假中央信託局四樓該司駐滬辦事處，舉行四種公債還本抽籤。公債司司長陳柄章，特親自蒞處主持，市商會，銀錢兩業公會，及審計部，各派代表監視。由四行代表執行抽簽。茲將中籤號碼，探誌如次：</p>

<h3>各業紛起認購　美金公債庫劵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美金債券募銷委員曾，於昨日下午三時，在中央銀行三樓會議室，舉行招待各業公會負責人茶會。到五金，棉布等業公會代表多人。該會主委錢新之，副主委杜月笙，徐寄廎，相繼致詞。並由秘書長奚倫，副秘書長范鶴言，分別說明床劵公債意義，及還本付息辦法。繼即由各業公會代表自動認購，計造紙，航業，保險，電影等業，各認美金五萬元。棉花業三萬元，麵粉業二萬元，橡膠商業一萬元。其餘五金，戲劇，證券，人造絲，房地產，鐵業等同業公會，一俟召開會員大會決定後，即可儘量認購云。</p>
<h3>紗價易漲難跌</h3>
<p>昨日現紗市情，因有南京經濟委員會物價會議席上通過工人生活指數解凍以後，根據新辦法發給工資之說，嗣後紗廠成本將提高，致價又呈易漲難跌之趨勢。惟市上銀根仍緊，升度似稍受挫，而客帮納胃亦呆，故結果四十二支藍鳳紗做高一千二百四十萬元，比上日僅升四十萬元。二十支特雙馬六百六十五萬元，漲十五萬元。其餘二十支及十六支等各紗上揚，自十萬元至三四十萬元不一云。</p>
<h3>布市局勢盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日棉布開市仍在軟檔徘徊，十二磅龍頭細布喊價曾小至廿五萬八千元，旋傳證券回升，散戶爭先吸購，價即上揚，至最後價爲廿六萬元，與前相彷。四君子金印嗶嘰，業中人見解不一，終因進戶較多，價做高至二十六萬元，軋升五千元。其他漂布粗布及色布士林布等，因銀根未鬆，進戶觀望，市呈盤旋之勢。</p>
<p>紡建公司照例供售棉布三十餘種，分門市及布號申購，但請購者不踴躍。十二磅藍鷄細布爲廿三萬四千元，二等品四君子元嗶嘰廿三萬五千元，與上期無甚變更。</p>
<h3>新鈔由英運滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕太古藍烟囱公司，經理之米杜號（譯音）昨由英倫抵滬，除各種鋼鐵雜貨三于九百餘噸外，另有國行新紙幣一千一百零四箱，該輪現泊藍烟囱碼頭卸貨。</p>
<h3>銀根轉鬆華股反漲</h3>
<p>華股昨起反動，銀根轉鬆，證劵帮紛紛追購，中小型股紛吿漲停。美亞增資傳說不一，跌停後有回。永紗在收市後，喊價亦迫近漲停。晨開時即交各股除美亞開低，火柴漲停外，除均開高。遞交開出見昂，開後遞永紗由二三一號三一號八三號一八八號一八三號。四號九四號脫手，由堅而略疲，美亞復吿跌停，下降至五三〇〇元。一二一號一二二號一五三號一六三號一二九號一一九號一八五號一五二號均進，新華首先漲停，新光信和景福勤興次第漲達限度，形勢漸好，一六〇號一七七號再進至五五八〇元，七六號一一二號逢高有供，二三一號一七三號九四號再進，永公景綸中紡漲停，乃將遞永紗拉上至五六四〇元。二二三號一二六號一一七號一三七號八二號趁高脫手，退至五四三〇元。六五號一〇六號九一號一五二號復來買進，可升至五六五〇元。一五五號八五號八三號一六〇號八九號二三一號二〇七號紛有賣出，近午時曾回低至五三八〇元。十一時三刻，買氣又盛，一五二號一四五號二二二號一　一號等均有補進，午收升爲五　〇〇元。經濟緊急方案有取銷之說，收復喊高至五七〇〇元。結果較前收計新光信和永公景福勸興新華漲達限度，永紗升一成弱，美亞跌停後有回，軋低半成强。遞交計新光永公景福動與均吿漲停，永紗升半成，美亞跌停後有回，軋低少許。冷股計景綸大通新亞五和火柴漲達限度，中紡漲停後有回，軋升一成，績益中絲水泥各升一成左右，塲外各股升降咸微，永紗套利昨自一九〇元至二四〇元，獲息三角左右。</p>
<h3>上海市銀行準備　擴大小本工業貸款　每戶額增至百萬元</h3>
<p>上海市銀行前曾辦理本市各小本手工業貸款，第一次貸放二億元，旋增加至五億元，現又經市參議會議決，請市府轉飭該行擴大辦理，茲悉該行奉令後，業已準備着手辦理，並經擬訂貸款辦法數點：（一）每戶貸網增至一百萬元，期限六個月，在滿三個月時，先行償還本息半數，餘俟到期歸淸，利率按月五分計算。（二）貸款申請手續，亦力求簡化，先由各該業公會備函向該行彙領申請　等件若干份，分發所屬各貸款會員，塡就後，並覓具妥保一家，及將自有工業設備作爲擔保品，再由公會負責證明彙送該行。經審核及對保後，即逕行通知各貸戶憑原印鑑領款。</p>
<h3>人造絲堅定</h3>
<p>人造絲因存貨缺乏，且配貨尙無期，故人心頗堅定。昨市一二〇號高山有光開盤一千七百五十萬元成交一箱後，即在三四十萬元之問盤旋，最後喊七百三十萬元收盤，與上日軋平。</p>
<p>廠經昨市只有喊價，並無成交。A字等級跌進二千萬元關內，各級俱比上日喊短五十萬元。干經去路軟呆，喊價竟小一百萬元左右。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市繼續下挫，大誠被面喊七百八十萬元，尙乏受主，格子璧縐比上日小二千元，羅紡討價一萬一千元，但正式成交價只一萬元。</p>
<h3>糖市趨勢又緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢復緊，秘魯細砂做至四十四萬四千元，二四粗白四十七八萬元，均升萬元。廿號中砂四十三萬五千元，升五千元。四半車白四十六萬元，無上落。三半車白四十五萬元，升五千元。土糖無甚上落，順德靑二十六萬四千元，刁靑白包高貨廿六萬元至廿四萬五千元，次之價不一。興化白四七二萬元至四十一萬五千元，興赤卅一萬元至卅萬元，合赤三十四萬元。</p>

<h3>茶市欲好無力</h3>
<p>萎頓多時之洋莊茶市，依然朱見轉機，蓋以買氣續呈懈怠，人心欲好無力。至於各種內銷茶，供求平衡，仍在盤檔局面中，惟天津帮所需之去年度徽州烘靑及珠蘭茶，則受存底空盧之影響，交易雖乍隱乍現，市勢比前步堅，價格方面，益趨穩固。</p>
<h3>海味市況萎頓</h3>
<p>海味價格本已到頂峯，近受銀根影響，行家紛紛謀脫，故各貨均見萎頓，蝦尾來貨不絕，除金山尾外，各檔皆跌一成之譜，海參魚翅到銷兩稀，趨勢平疲，魷魚海蜓木耳因去化呆滯，脚地軟弱。惟香菰產地已經掃山，而所存各檔均上冷氣，以備夏銷，故尙堅穩。其餘各貨因交易淸淡，恐再有挫落之象。</p>
<h3>造漆工業困難多　盼望政府配售原料幷限制舶來品輸入</h3>

<h3>五金市況</h3>
<p>五金各貨近日受金票黑市狠狂，米價暴漲，及生活指數有解凍可能等訊，凡人工製成物品均一律昇騰。洋釘反見下跌，人頭砂布因到貨稀少，實鎖增加，在求過於供之狀况下終於在上升之中。</p>

<h3>中華海軍學員　在英受訓中</h3>
<p>— 四月廿日航訊　雯寄自普萊茅斯</p>
<p>我國東　太平洋，海岸線東北起自遼寗之鴨蛋綠江口，（北緯五三度五〇分）西南迄於廣東省之北　河口，（北緯一〇度）長凡七百五十餘公里。此外孤處海洋中的島嶼，像海南島，台灣及其他小島猶未列入；要保衛這　延長長的海岸線，非有現代化的海軍不可。建立新海軍，在整個國防政策上，決非一紙計劃可吿成立。在勝利後的祖國，雖處於萬分艱苦困難的環境下，還是不顯一切的在策進；在上海的高昌廟，還有北部的靑島，那裏有海軍士兵學校，以及海軍軍官學校，一羣英雄奮發的靑年，在那裏受着嚴格的訓練——也就是未來的新中國海軍基幹部隊，他們努力地學習各種不同的科目，預備將替國家服務，保衛祖國的海岸。也有從這一羣裏挑選出一批優秀的靑年士官，由國家派遺到海外盟國接受新的學識訓練，豫備回國來建立新海軍。這裏我特來介紹一批在英國普萊茅斯（Plymouth）軍港受訓的中華海軍學員的動態。</p>
<p>普萊茅斯是英國皇家海軍的中央根據地。那裏的冬季氣候，幾乎天天飄着雪花。受訓的地點是在一隻大兵艦上——冒險號（Renown）上，那是一艘有四萬噸排水量的巨艦，是英國海軍中第」大軍艦，說起他的煌煌戰績，煞是可敬；曾參加過第一次世界大戰。冒險號是英國皇家海軍主力艦三隻中之一，造於一九一六年，餘二艦已在此次大戰中被軸心機所擊沉，此艦也算幸運，未受罹難。過去英皇檢閱海軍，均坐此艦為司令艦，太平洋虞事發生後，美故總統羅斯福及英首相邱吉爾都曾在冒險號上開過會議，商謀戰略，故頗著聲譽，名聞全世。冒險號排水量號稱四萬噸，係登記數量，實際上不止此數。馬力十一萬匹，裝有十六吋砲六門，高射砲六門，副砲八門，魚雷管二個，建築費達三百多萬金鎊。</p>
<p>冒隊號上</p>
<p>在中國時所發給之全部服裝，全部繳銷，換着發來的是穿上英國式的制服。每人計發到大衣一件，雨衣一件，呢制服二套，工作服一件，皮鞋三雙——二黑一白，白西裝短褲三條，長褲二條，羊毛襪三雙，襯衫五件，大毛巾二條，衛生衣褲二套，毛線衫一件，帽二頂，其他零皇用件若干，估計這許多東西，價値相當龐大。在英國的物資統制，說出來眞令人不信，你非有政府所發給的配給證Copon，即使　　十萬，也決不會買到一根毛的。不論一塊小手帕亦然如此，而且價昂貨劣。吃的東西則准吃不准帶出。難怪這一次在蘇聯舉行的外長會議出席的英國外交官，吃東西狼呑虎嚥了。普萊茅斯從德機侵襲轟炸，至今還是瓦礫堆積，戰痕隨處可見，猶未見恢復也。至原有電車軌道現今皆擱置不用，而以公共汽車代替，一些也不見到擁擠，不比上海的交通阻塞。軍人憩息地有Naffi，那裏什麽都有，吃的，穿的，用的，玩的，往遊者均爲海軍，而且各國海軍都有，女海軍也有。可見他們對軍人之優裕了。</p>
<p>一九四七年二月在英受訓的海軍學員，學習的基本訓練已經很順利的完成了，據說在訓練時某一部份的學員連ABCD都開不淸楚，當然在上課時更是莫名其妙了，根本不懂敎官在講些什麽東西。</p>
<p>分科學習</p>
<p>在分科分送到各專科學校去肄習他心愛的學科以前，他們自己每人都選擇自己所希望的功課，分做第一，第二，第三，第四……志願。他們所學習課程的範圍，可以分做；</p>

<h3>東台風雨</h3>
<p>— 五月三日東台快訊　本報記才　凌松壽</p>
<p>重到東台，喝到了厚重而帶着鹹味的白開水，嘴上和心頭，都勾起了一陣莫名的惆悵。</p>
<p>（上）英國贈我建立新中國海軍的一艘軍艦「震旦號」，（Renown排水量七千噸）已油漆全新，不久即將啓椗來華。（下）我國海軍學員在英受訓時的一艘英國巨型艦「冒險號」（Aruora排水量四萬五千噸）的雄姿。（雯寄）</p>
<p>東台情况不安定，公路上時常有共軍竄擾，在未啓程之前，很多人勸我不要走。可是我終於以帶着一點探險的心境　跑了一趟。因爲這是一塊與我有一段不太淺之關係的地方。</p>
<p>東台，我是看着牠收復的，部隊沿着通楡公路前進，我一步步地跟着而終於到了東台城。</p>
<p>細雨濛濛中跨上了小輪船，流水淙淙，我暗說；「我且把自己暫時交給你！」護航隊的機槍，架在船頭上，正正地對着前面，如臨大敵。</p>
<p>板狹壕深　彷彿過獨木關</p>
<p>在煩燥和鬱悶的心情下，消磨了六小時的航程而到了東台。爬上了岸，經過檢查，還要通過一道深而且闊的戰壕才能進入街市區。戰壕上面支了一塊木板，其用意大概和古時候城門面前的吊橋一樣，隨時可以抽去。板狹壕深，走上去心驚阻怕，眞有過獨木關之概。再加遍街碉堡，尤其是在醫院的紅十字和銀行的金招牌之旁，有了一座作巷戰之用的東西，於是東台便整個地籠罩在緊張的氣氛之下。</p>
<p>記者到東合的兩天，正是距城二十華里的草埝鎭失陷而駐軍又有換防的消息之際，同時，風傳共軍已在小海徵集祖架隊進備攻城。一班消息靈通人士，紛紛把家眷送出，其中以公務人員比較多，眞有惶惶不可終日之勢。「現在連消息都不敢打聽了，如果眞的知道了實在的情况，那一天也過不得！」</p>
<p>鐘樓打鐘　宣吿戒嚴開始</p>
<p>就事論事，東台的情况，不能說不嚴重。以一個面積有五十七萬餘方公里的一等縣，現在能在政府控制之下的除去一個縣城而外，祇有通海安的一條公路和通泰縣的一條官河。李俠夫縣長對記者說，現在能控制四分之一的地區，這恐怕還多少帶一點政治家的口吻。城區治安在軍政當局的治理之下，當然可保無虞，但是到了午後八時即宣布戒嚴，情况緊張時還要提早。戒嚴開始時，以鐘樓上的鐘聲報吿，當記者第一次聽到的時候，這一聲一聲的鐘聲，顫動地鑽進了我的心房。推窗一望，一片漆黑，縱有一些亮光，都黯淡得可憐。通海安的公路能通車，但很「勉强」，記者抵東台之當夜，富安東台間的路面和電綫，就遭共軍破壞。至於官河這條交通綫，算是比較安全的，不過距官河南岸二三十華里的南莫莊，就是共軍的紫石縣政府所在地。在這共軍到處流跋之時，誰又能說不會受到威脅？</p>
<p>草埝之失陷，據李縣長稱係有一股流匪從興化境穿過通杭綫而到海邊，經過草埝時放了一把火，第二天即吿收復，但是迄記者離開東台爲止，東台　城間的交通尙未能迅即恢復。</p>
<p>魚米之鄕　海味棉鹽價貴</p>
<p>東台是魚米之鄉，素來以生產海味·食鹽·棉花而負盛名。現在因爲濱海的地區完全陷入共軍之手，所以一斤兩枚的大蝦米。早已看不見了，即使有少較的其他海味出售，其價格都已超過了上海的市價。棉鑒的生產，自然更不必說。草安鹽塲公署是管理掘港至伍佑道一段濱海鹽塲的，先設在泰縣，東台收復後，便移到東台，到此爲止，即不能再繼績推進，展開塲務。塌署裏面，記者有不少舊識，也許因爲是天雨或是時局緊張的關係吧，一進去，我只看見大家淸談解悶，沒有事做。唐塲長說：「現在的業務僅僅是收一點零星的鹽稅，塲署固然說不上，連稽征所都不如。」說到這裏，記者注視着壁上掛的一幅江蘇省地圖，對那濱海八百里長的鹽墾區，深深地呼吸了一口氣。</p>
<p>記者初抵東台，看見河中有若干船隻滿裝着一包包的棉籽和小麥，我還慶幸着東台的當裕，誰知道這原來是在大中集失陷之前搶運得來的呢。大中集原是棉花的集散地，爲縣政府稅捐收入之大宗。東台縣行政費月支五萬萬元，全部縣財政收入在三月份是三萬萬元，相差兩萬萬地，顯得促襟見肘。可是四月份大中集失陷後，收入只剩了一萬萬元都不到。這樣大的一個財政赤字，如何來彌補，殊屬困難。據縣黨部詹保黃書記長相吿，除去加緊實現財政統一收支的辦法而外，現在也只有斟酌情形征收捐稅來補救了。這當然是過渡期間的辦法。假使治安穩固，那財政問題，總會慢慢地正常起來。</p>
<p>鹽塲一瞥</p>
<p>控制區內　已盡力之所以能</p>
<p>東台現在是綏靖區實騐縣，在萬分苦難的狀態下，還要做出一點給別的地方做模範的事件出來，這又是够苦的事。記者盤桓兩日，走馬觀花，印象最深的要算是街上的一片藍色。商店的櫃樹，門板，電燈柱等，都漆得一律，並寫上白色的標語。此外，如街道的修整，公共衛生機構和合作社等，「在控制區內，凡是力量能做到的，都做了。」這是第六區專員張迺藩氏在鎭江對記者講的。他還有一句話：「我們正想法了擴展出去！」他來鎭江是參加省府行政會議的，一見記者面就問：「東台怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>記者在東台兩天，斜風細雨，看了就不舒服；走的那天，天却放晴了，登船之後，日輪湧出，水面上金蛇亂舞，晴空萬里，鬱悶的心境爲之一舒。記者立足船舷，向送行的友人們揮着手，輕輕地喚一聲：「東台，祝福你在風雨中安好！」</p>

<h3>現代法蘭西繪畫論　純粹的繪畫</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>現代法蘭西畫壇，許多驚人的繪畫上主張的勃興，使人感到應接不暇。旣有像三角幾何形體的立體主義，音樂符號樣式的達達主義，如幻如夢想入非非的超現實主義等的作家，造成種種畫派而成功他們彪炳的事業、亦有像新古典主義和新野獻主義Mouvean　Forvi　m（係與超現實主義同時抬頭的繪畫新主義、惟超現實主義方面在感怕及表現方法上較爲自由。）那樣，並非自成一派而僅係形成這種趨勢的作家。不過，這樣的看法，都是批評家便宜上所用的名稱，其實每一個畫家都有他們獨自的藝術上的主張，又有他們獨特的表現上的個性；以故想納入所謂畫派或主義的範疇，頗爲困難。縱觀現下法蘭西畫壇，確可認爲畫派者，恐衹有超現實主義與純粹主義，甚至是機械主義吧。</p>
<p>其他很多的畫家們，都可說是各有其自己獨特的個性，而在其獨自的樣式之下，任性的表現其所崇信的藝術底精神，所以，如爲方便批評家的說明而把他們分成許多畫派，是不能認爲有多大的正確性的。且這種分類，因批評家的見解未必一致，亦難免會有相當的差異。故如必欲認定一種畫派的話，不如像安特萊，薩爾蒙A．Salmon所說：「把這羣畫家總括成一類而悉包含於「巴黎畫派」這一名稱之下。」換言之，可使成爲巴黎畫壇的一種綜合性的範域，而令老作家，中堅作家以及一般新進的靑年作家混合的十包羅其中。</p>
<p>然而在此被稱爲巴黎畫派之中，旣有已失活力暮氣沈滯的作者，亦有精力旺盛而嶄然露角的畫家，亦有朝氣蓬勃埋頭努力的無名靑年。要想評述這數達萬千的畫家及其作品，絕不可能。因此，我們首先須得着眼的，應該是現代巴黎畫壇中正在揭示着怎樣的繪畫上的問題。</p>
<p>現代巴黎畫壇之所以有如此地位，它是由於二十世紀初期强烈的繪畫運動的野獸主義的啓發，再通過立體派的理論，慘酷的戰爭前洗禮及達達主義的爆發始完成的。其間勃興的繪畫上的主義或畫派，多至不勝枚舉。然這些關於繪畫上的雜多的主義或主張，決非含有繪畫上遊戲三昧的性質，當爲力圖發現眞實的繪畫底本質的，驚人的努力之探求和考察。再說一句，這些繪畫上主義之興替演變，均可說是探求畫藝眞理之『實騐』Experience。每一種繪畫底實騐，縱禾成爲完成的畫幅，但在許多繪畫底實騐及眞實的研究之結果，都帶來了寳貴的供獻。</p>
<p>所謂繪畫的成果是什麽？我們可作如下的解答。那就是「繪畫須得純粹是繪畫」。道話，似乎很平凡。然而眞理決非是奇異的產物，常會自平凡之中脫穎而出。這也並不是說：因爲是眞理所以是平凡，而是設具有一種想從平凡中發現眞理的犀利的目光，則眞理纔會熠熠放光。現代繪畫，由於綿亙三四十年的探求，終於在平凡之中被發現『繪畫不得不純粹是繪盡』的眞理。所謂繪畫純粹是繪畫，換句話講：就是說『繪畫應該是純粹繪畫』，而現代法蘭西畫壇，當可說就向這種純粹繪畫集中進展着。</p>
<p>我們推老純粹繪畫的樣式化，並就純粹繪畫的理論加以研究，則這種繪畫的表現，便在於所謂繪畫的造形Formation。</p>
<p>如果繪畫上的一切技巧和其表現底精神，都能够充分的繪畫化，充分的純粹化，就成爲繪畫的『造形』。純粹繪畫的一切表現，均可說是獲得畫面上的繪畫底效果。說到把握畫面上的繪畫底效果，便是關於繪畫的造形現象。作爲製作純粹畫面的方法，而所謂表現法遂被重視，被研究。因此，所謂純粹繪畫之表現，不僅是畫完畫面的技巧，實是獲得畫面的繪畫底效果的方法。換言之，便是繪畫上的技巧，假使未能獲得何等畫面的繪畫底效果，那就不能說是純粹繪畫之表現。</p>
<p>當一個畫家對某物象加以寫生的時候，如描寫那物象的綫條，而僅把那物體如實的表現出來是不够的。僅僅如此，則即使是一張插圖，亦不能作爲繪畫而論列。爲使可能作爲繪畫而論列起見，則無論是簡單的寫生，或是簡單的來描，其描法亦非絕對『繪畫底』的不可。又如選擇某種題材，就算是那題材被描繪得逼眞，自然，僅如此，亦不能作爲純粹繪畫而論。假如能將這些題材脫離那所謂像實物和似自然的槪念，充分的加以繪畫化，和繪畫的純粹化，那纔足以成爲繪畫的問題。也纔是足以作爲繪畫而製作的表現。這一點，並不是簡單的架空的事情。爲使其能够充分的繪畫化及充分的繪畫的純粹化不得不豫計畫面而作爲繪畫底對象。所以繪畫上的表現，不外是在這繪畫底對象面將題材繪畫化的過程。</p>
<p>所謂在繪畫底對象面即畫面把題材繪畫化，不單是依靠着繪畫的基本要素——色彩與綫條，而是要使那題材預計到『繪畫底』還元；並且必須把握它「繪畫底」構圖。這種現象，似乎近於科學的分析，但其實不然，倒是綜合而統一的。可認爲它是由於繪畫底色彩，綫條，構圖這幾種要素而構成的繪畫底造形的畫面。</p>
<p>所謂選擇繪畫底的題材，亦可說是繪畫底造形之一。猶如我們栽插瓶花所割取山野的花草一樣，被選爲繪畫底題材之題材，顯然是割離自然的東西。所謂從自然割離者，將存在於自然的秩序移置於另一個不同的境界，變成了繪畫底秩序Ordnurg。換句話說，所謂繪畫底題材者，也就是說將原存在於自然的秩序，通過作家的頭腦，將它納入繪畫底新秩序——範疇之內，使之純粹的繪畫化了。</p>
<p>其次，是將繪畫底題材描寫於畫面，這不用說便是繪畫底造形。其表現之優越與否，全繫於這繪畫的造形的效果，所以，所謂繪畫上的表現者，是負荷着繪畫的效果的，而負荷這繪畫底效果和精神的，即是表現。而在這表現完結時，才研究到所謂樣式。是以繪畫的造形本身，不消說表現，而經過被繪畫底裁製，便是樣式。由於那造形的被經過裁製的關係，才硏究到繪畫上的諸樣式。</p>
<h3>盛唐近事女像　（敦煌壁畫）</h3>
<p>— 張大午臨</p>
<h3>頑鐵道人傳後序</h3>
<p>— 老梅</p>
<p>頑鐵道人傳者，乃蔡子北崙自述其生平志願與遭逢之文也。道人雖自稱頑鐵，而予則視道人如磨不磷，湼不緇之貞金　玉；且具有伯夷之淸，伊尹之任，柳下惠之和，乃所願則學孔子者也。道人本閩籍，其大父淸季遊宦于台灣，道人生於其地，故亦自稱臺人。甲午淸廷敗　割讓臺灣於倭，道人方在鬆齡，即慨然有子房報韓之志。冠歲奉親命留學倭京，學成因慈母在堂，勉就俀聘，有柳下惠不羞汚君，不卑小官之風。嗣遭母喪，覺大事完舉，則視横政之所出，横民之所止，不忍居也。遂解職買棹歸祖國，流窩滬濱，而爲避紂居北海，以待時之伯夷矣。</p>
<p>方道人初返中華，欣見民國吿成，河山光復，滿擬出所學以問世，蓋欲爲使斯民被堯舜之澤，而身任以天下之重之伊尹也。奈當時目覩內患頻仍，侘傺灰心；又痛念台灣，尙屬倭領，因而留戀宗邦，仍作與鄉人處，由由然不忍去之柳下惠，以醫卜星相自隱佚居而不怨，阨窮而不憫也。回憶道人辭謝倭官，掉頭不顧，則有如孔子去齊，接浙而行；所謂可以速則速也。</p>
<p>最近國難初興，江南陷敵，倭人出厚幣聘道人任重職，道人再三却之，不肯屈就；或議爲頑固，或譽爲鐵漢。道人即以頑鐵自命焉，遜世无悶，窮居不損，所謂可以處則處也。幸而美彈一震，蘇聯出兵，暴倭屈服，禹域重光，五十年來，淪陷之台灣，復歸祖國之懷抱。道人之喜可知也！竊以道人當遄返故里，參與台政，奈何遲遲其行，尙有孔子去父母邦之感耶？</p>
<p>因念予民六初與道人相識，即驚其抱負非常：任俠自喜。曁民十七再遏道人，曾撰贈道人序一篇，以誌一時感慨。今回刧後重逢，則相看俱老，變髮各蒼，見其遠志猶存，壯心未已，亟詢遲歸之故。則出吿墓文相示，乃知道人早浩然有歸志，特阨於種種情事，不克如願。固未嘗一日忘祖宗墳墓也。</p>
<p>邇來台政失調，民變驟起，幸當局力圖善後，亂事弭平；台人切盼道人歸台，爲桑梓服務。道人亦急思歸去，予曰：此孔子可以仕則仕之時也。道人其將以金聲玉振之條理，大展經綸於台灣，一抒其棄抱乎！或曰：道人之頑鐵已成百鍊金鋼，未審可以化爲繞指柔，以應付轉變之時局否耶？是則在道人之身擇自處耳。但予敢斷言，道人絕不改其貞潔之風度也。僅序於傳後以貽之。</p>
<h3>讀張大千近作</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>初夏的天氣，竟因春寒的延長，使人們的內心，仍少溫暖的感覺。昨午夏雨初霽，得讀張大千的近作畫件，蘊積在心裏的不舒暢氣，好像銷除得一乾二淨。</p>
<p>大千去冬化去五十條金子，購入董北苑的「江隄晚景」畫幅。宋人作品的見於著錄，「宣和畫譜」中所記董源的畫只有七十八張，「江隄晚景圖，」是其中精品之一。大千當時購入，曾經轟傳藝壇，說是打破了鉅款購畫的紀錄。大千曾以兩月的期間，照樣臨撫一幀，眞是腕中有鬼，使人見着驚心動魄，不知誰是眞本與臨本。米襄陽評董畫有說：「董源平淡天眞，唐無此品，在畢宏上，近世神品，格高莫與比也。峯巒出沒，雲霧顯晦，不裝巧趣，皆得天眞；嵐色鬱蒼，枝榦勁挺，咸有生意；溪橋漁浦，洲渚掩映，一片江南也。」原來我國山水畫，到了北苑，纔接近自然對象，和西洋畫的風景寫生，異途同歸。小樹常用點畫成，墨勢淋漓，米家手法，實由此而來。大千深得個中秘奥，故此幅認爲生平傑作之一了。</p>
<p>唐宮按樂圖，設色構圖，都費無數心思，突破以前一般畫家的常例。畫中是宮殿的一角，有類攝影取景的特寫。而人物的描繪，更爲特異，要是不留心的，驟然看來，只見四五人而已，如果細心的觀摩，纔知道畫中人有八。原來其中有僅露半臉的，有露着一裙的，有只見一脚的，這種構圖，在西洋畫或美術攝影中，問有見到，而在國畫的仕女中，似是創作了。他還有一個特點，就是畫的左右兩旁，畫有五彩圖案，這些圖案樣式，是從敦煌壁畫裏移植過來，絢爛華麗的色素，更加襯託整張畫幅的調和美。這種嘗試，大千是開創了國畫的新紀元，値得我們深長硏究的</p>
<p>民卅三年，敎育部曾在重慶爲大千舉行臨摹敦煌壁畫展覽會，震動了整個山城。日本降服以後，大千到申，新知舊友，多勸大千將全部敦煌臨畫移滬公開展覽，給東亞第一國際都市放一異彩。可是因着交通關係，輸運艱困，一時未能成爲事實。大千這次却帶來數張，給愛好古代藝術者的硏究。如漠高窟第廿六窟五代歸義軍節度使曹義，金夫人迴　國天公主隴西李西供養像，一百五十一窟盛唐近事女像，同窟比丘尼像，楡林窟十九窟大勢至菩薩，二百四十五窟北魏薩埵王子捨身飼虎圖，雖然只有此六張，但是鼎嘗一變，可例其餘了。唐人畫，在今“已不容易得見，何况是北魏的畫圖！故此北魏飼虎圖，我們可以知道當時的畫風實際情狀。盛唐近事女像（見圖），高七尺六寸，寬四尺三寸。此窟在民國前四十七年庚子四月七日，道士王圓籙發現藏經處。前幾年，大千遊敦煌的時候，道士向他訴親發現的經過，這是一段歷史的因緣。畫中樹枝上掛着的袋，和現在流行新式的女用手袋，十分相像，而圖中人所拿的手杖，却和現在通用的手杖相同，頭髮捲式歷久如新，這是使人看了都感到很有興味的。加以道些壁畫的臨摹製作，却是出於全能畫家之手，他的用筆用墨敷色，自然有他的特殊技巧，這是不用　說的了。</p>
<p>大于此次回成都三個多星期，返滬後便有許多新的作品給我們欣賞，在我們是無限眼福。看了一遍，因把所得，約略寫述，使我們知道物價飛騰，戰事未息的國度裏，別一個角落，還是眞美善的社會呀。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血505</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>門外沒有人答話，只神秘地繼續敲門，兩下剝啄中，加一間歇；一共敲了六下，仍舊敲的那們輕細。</p>
<p>「誰？」鶴見聽見外面無人答應，而且這個敲門方式，神秘之中，還含着一些戲弄意味；好像熟識朋友，在同他開玩笑似的。然而偌大一個上海，鶴見知道並沒有這麽一個熟習的朋友，因此心下一面奇怪，一面也有些氣惱；所以提高了嗓子問着「誰」？</p>
<p>剝剝，…剝剝…剝剝…剝剝…這一回共啄了八次。</p>
<p>這敵門聲音，每次遞增兩下。要說外面的人，沒有聽見鶴見問「誰？」的聲音，而鶴見一問之下，外面緊接就剝啄起來；要說來人已經聽見了，至少應該答應一聲才對，不是嗎？旣然不答　，一逕這們剝啄下去，到底是怎麽一回事？</p>
<p>同時從這每次遞增兩下剝啄的聲響，推測下去，簡直說明門內的鶴見，如不改變方式，老是這們問下去，那們外的剝啄聲，勢必也兩下兩下地遞增下去。這不是戲弄是什麽？至少，在鶴見這種失意的心境下，無端對他這們鬧着，委實有些戲弄意味。</p>
<p>「到底是誰哪？」鶴見顯然發了執拗脾氣。</p>
<p>門外的回答，是十下剝啄；每兩下中，間歇一下；表示門內的人，如不開門，這剝啄聲響，就此要遞增下去。</p>
<p>「時衰鬼弄人！」鶴見道時，也許有這個心理。但在這一次十下剝啄之後，鶴見忽然悟到，來人必是守一：像正岩是他一下屬，不敢開這玩笑；李明在見面之後，　一直是那們嚴肅拘謹，不會有這舉動；至於那位韓國少年代表，靦觍得同繡房關閣一般，更不會幹這玩意。</p>
<p>至於守一，那却難說，因他同鶴見，乍一見面，只談了幾句話，就親熱熟習得同老朋友一般，並也當面開過玩笑。也只有守一·正岩·李明·等幾個人，已經來過，常然不用通報。鶴見認定這人必是守一。進一步想，守一旣在這種焦惄局勢之下，這麽來同鶴見鬧着玩，必是將得好消息了來；也許百忍莊的同志們，玩着游俠勾當，故意神出鬼沒似的，露這一下手段，竟在這邊三方面都沒想到的當口，輕輕巧巧地，把萍子從匪窟弄了出來，送到鶴見這裏，讓他吃一大驚。</p>
<p>這些幻想，在鶴見腦中，只是電花石火一般，閃爍了下下。這也是無理由推想的理由，不過一種一想情願的心理錯覺。當時鶴見幻想到此，便啞然失笑，不再發間，便大踏步搶到到門邊，把一扇門拉的大閒。</p>
<p>「對不起，嘻，猪玀米先生嗎？」聲音是那們甜脆，並且富有膛音，好像練過多年聲樂的嗓子，說的一口純粹道地的北平腔調。</p>
<h3>精神食糧的慚愧</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>報載成都最近曾發生騷動，貧民成千累百，搶刧米商食米，一時各街所有米店糖食店等等均閉門停業，儼若罷市。其中唯一照常開門營業者，厥爲書店。朋友們看到這個消息，認爲書店業（也就是出版界）足以自豪矣。可是後來仔細想想，却又覺得可悲而自慚起來。貧民不搶書店，並不是對文化特別表示尊重，而是他們對這一份精神食糧並不感到迫切的需要，他們根本就不理會我們這份精神食糧的存在而已。</p>
<p>在文化圈子裏面，說起精神食糧，儼然重於一切，好像眞有這一種可以吃的東西，不吃便會覺得饑荒。並且更有認眞的人，對於這些精神食糧異常挑剔，要分別出何者有益，何者有毒，深怕害了那些吃它的人。殊不知所謂食糧也者，衹有米麥才被老百姓看成活命的根本，至於精神云云，他們衹看做是少數文人雅士所偏愛的廢紙，在他們眼睛裏估計起來，祗有幾個錢買一斤用來包包鹽糖或花生米，並沒有什麼其他的價値。</p>
<p>這不是老百姓冷酷無情，而是製造精神食糧的人，多半閉門造車，沒有顧到大衆的需要。他們衹造出一種非常精細的點心，除了少數知識分子以外，其他的人們對它並無胃口。更進一步說，連這精細兩字，都成問題。多半是名爲細點，其實却是不堪咀嚼的代用品，豪華裝飾的劣等貨。再退一步說，現在即使造出了名符其實的精美細點，甚至普及大衆的平民食品，無奈大衆根本還吃不來這些東西，呌他們如何能把它當作食糧看待。說來說去，精神食糧和大衆之間，至今還隔着一道文字的鴻溝，在橋梁未曾架起以前，那怕精神食糧大吹大擂說得如何好聽，他們還是可望而不可即，無法來採購服用。</p>
<p>這一條橋梁有人將它稱爲識字運動。然而單單識字恐怕未必就走得過去。三五個月用速成方法所認識的字、可以在三五個月以後用同樣速度完全忘記。唯有把精神食糧舖在識字的橋梁上面，方能使大衆有能力並且有熱情地走過橋來。這個工作談何容易。文化與敎育倘然不密切携起手來，此事即難有實現的可能。</p>

<h3>傀儡詩話</h3>
<p>— 丈夫</p>
<p>「纔從于第拜乾娘，今拜乾爺又姓梁，熱鬧門牆新戶部，凄凉庭院　中堂；翁如有意應憐妾，奴豈無顏只爲郞，百八念珠情寄厚，臨風幾陣乳花香。」</p>
<p>此爲乾隆間好事者嘲翰林汪某詩，汪素無行，謟事好貴，其妻始拜金壇于相國妾爲母，嗣相國十勢義，又赴唐泉拜梁階平尙書爲義父，跡殊暱密，冬月嚴寒，梁早朝。汪妻輒先取朝珠，溫諸胸間，親爲懸掛。雷其初至。執黃拜見日，出懷中珊瑚珠，雙手奉之，梁大頳，走避之，汪妻將珠追至慮事，圜繞其頸，時座上客滿，皆大驚詫。越日有人乃題此詩於汪門，舊日有小說名「傀儡記」者，即所述此事也。</p>
<p>汪之　緣結納，乃至不惜命　頭人獻媚取歡，爲婢妾娼妓亦不屑爲之事，眞無恥之甚也。觀其纔拜乾娘，又拜乾爺，趨炎附勢，忘恩負義，則其肉更不足食矣。然人情冷暖，古今同殊，矧彼傀儡人物，罔顧廉恥，不知道義，以利爲合，以金結交，利絕金盡，自同陌路，誰復相顧哉？聞某某諸逆，沐猴而冠日，義子繞滕，桃李盈門，觸匐階前，以一親詞色爲無上之榮。今彼諸逆，鐵索瑯璫，相繼下獄。門前冷落，遂逐皆避去，無復一存其家矣。</p>
<p>誦「綫從于第拜乾娘，今拜亁爺又姓梁。」兩語，及歎傀儡衣鉢，一脈相傳，似乎不足爲怪也。</p>
<h3>日本人在笑了</h3>
<p>— 小隱</p>
<p>到塘沽新港去參觀的平津記者，被我們的盟友用槍刺擋了駕，受了個不大不小的侮辱回來。</p>
<p>於是，靠岸一艘掛着「太陽旗」的船上的日本人，大聲地笑了。看着那篇記者們事後的聲明，我彷彿聽到了敵人們格格的梟鳥般的笑聲，我也彷彿看到了在笑容後面藏着的那張猙獰的鬼臉。</p>
<p>本來，「四强」或「五强」之一的我國，給人家侮辱已不止一次，可以不必大驚小怪；給戰敗國的人冷笑，似亦可置之勿論。事實上，他們不是已經製造了更大的濃谷事件給我們看麽？</p>
<p>但是，我想到了某一篇通訊中的話：大多數的日本人，都堅信失敗是暫時的，不久就能東山再起；我更想到了他們「二十年後再來」的臨別贈言。侵略的野心還沒有完全淸除，對於他們的笑，我們是很不應該「一笑置之」的。</p>
<p>聽吧，日本人在笑了！</p>
<p>我禁不住要問：他們會不會笑得更厲害，當看着我們到處尙在紛亂擾攘的狀態之中。</p>

<h3>凍結與解凍</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>在自然現象中，凍結與解凍是基於一種物理必然的定理。我們就普通的水說，氣溫到了攝氏表零度，必定凝成固體，到了零度以上，水又回復到液體狀態。這當中如不加人爲的作用，凍與解凍都是順着自然的溫度發展的</p>
<p>自然的現象是科學的，肯定的。你也曾看到冰點時的水不結冰麼？或則也看到六月炎暑還有凍結的河床？所以就社會現象說：在白米漲到三十萬大關時，工人的生活指數仍凍結在三個月前白米五六萬一石時的階段，這又怎是合理的？我們的社會秩序又怎能安定下來？</p>
<p>最近據說生活指數要解凍了，這是必然的，也是應該的。不過解凍吧，也要創造一個溶解的溫度。我們知道科學家要凝固或溶解一種物體，必然從改變物質的溫度做起，使牠自然的起了改變。凍與解的本身完全要看在怎樣的環境下進行。不明瞭這種物理，結果都會引起爆破。</p>
<p>人類文明的發展，是起源於溫帶區域，因爲那種溫暖的氣侯是最適宜於人們的工作。固然北極圈裏也有動植物的存在，但那一個地區迄今仍沒有人類高度的文化。生活凍結在冰窖中，社會是沒有進步的。這一種自然經騐，那是我們安定社會的大人先生們所應記取的。我們惟有調節社曾的氣溫，使解凍與凍結都成爲極自然的狀態，那才有人們眞正安樂的生活。</p>
<p>夏季已開始了，不但大地的封凍必然要求解固，而且我們還希望迎着欣欣向榮的日子呢。惟有在那充滿了活力的季節裏，凍結與解凍的問題才眞正得到了解決。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>三十多個人很安定地上了車，他們也知道搭車的人太多，並不想求舒服，大家盡理的擠，連行李僅僅佔了一輛半車；衹有蘭和緋緋因爲張昌盧前那些人的再三慫恿，才坐到了司機台上去。</p>
<p>「周小姐，朱小姐，回頭我們跟你們換！」蘭還是覺得很歉然，再三向兩個女演員說，應該大家輪流着坐。</p>
<p>「別忙」你們坐得穩坐不穩還說不定咧！」老祝笑着說。他很知道一輛卡車的司機台在人們的心目山是如何高貴的座位。</p>
<p>蘭淺淺地一笑，對於這一點，她顯然並不介意。</p>
<p>緋緋是太高典了，一忽兒爬上車頭，一忽兒又爬下來，一忽兒又去玩弄那個司機用的駕駛盤；張昌倒像是效哥哥似的伴着她，上上下下，前前後後的玩，高興得像春假時期出門去旅行的學生一樣。</p>
<p>昨天不曾上車那些人漸漸絡繹地找來了，寂靜的曠野裏，立刻鬧得人聲喧闃，像是趕築的日子。</p>
<p>五輛卡軍上很快的就寒滿了人。將近八點鐘的時候，一大羣穿草黄色卡其制服的人到了，聲浪便越發嘈雜起來。那些司機大人簡直開口就罵、動手就打，車上沒存率　的人全給轟走了；可是一會兒，又陵續來了另一批沒有車票而已得到他們默許的「黃魚」，數字上更比前者多，擠得車上的人沒有一個不愁眉苦臉的擔心如何能在這樣難以安身的卡車上忍受兩日夜的長途的馳驅。（六七）</p>

<h3>Economic Commission Discusses Price Stabilization, Grain Source Smoothing, and Index Restoration; Shanghai Wage Adjustment Measures Passed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Economic Commission's Price Commission held its sixth routine meeting at the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 10th. Attendees included Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Yu Dawei, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, Zhang Jia'ao, Wu Guozhen, Shen Yi, Gan Naiguang, Pang Songzhou, Chen Kewen, and Chairman Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. Regarding grain, the following was decided: (1) Earnestly protect legitimate grain merchants and rice shops, enabling them to operate as usual. (2) Strictly prohibit local authorities from restricting transportation, allowing free flow of grain, balancing surpluses and deficits. Those who obstruct or extort under false pretenses will be severely punished. (3) Strive to smooth grain sources in the interior, enabling surplus grain from Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces to supply Nanjing, Shanghai, and other areas. Regarding the issue of Shanghai workers' wages, the "Provisional Measures for Adjusting Shanghai Workers' Wages" submitted by the Ministry of Social Affairs were revised and passed.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Economic Commission's Price Meeting on the 10th revised and passed the "Provisional Measures for Adjusting Shanghai Workers' Wages" as follows: (1) Starting from May 1947, workers' wages in all industries will be calculated and paid monthly according to the index, in accordance with these measures. (2) The base wage must not be changed under any circumstances. If changes have occurred after the implementation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the original amount should be restored. (3) For those with base wages below 30 yuan, wages will be paid in full according to the index. (4) For those with base wages above 30 yuan up to 100 yuan, in addition to the 30 yuan paid in full according to the index, the remaining portion will be discounted by 10% for each 10 yuan increment. (5) If, due to poor production or business conditions, employers genuinely cannot afford to pay wages according to Articles 3 to 5 of these measures, they may reduce them through labor-management agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the labor-management arbitration board will decide. (6) Before the promulgation of these measures, if labor and management in various industries have already reached agreements on the discount method for paying wages according to the index, their agreements may be followed. (7) From the date of implementation of these measures, subsidies for the difference in rationing of goods will be immediately discontinued.</p>
<p>Authorities Consider Using Vouchers to Purchase Grain; Military Grain Quotas to be Gradually Reduced</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is heard that some individuals within the government advocate using vouchers to purchase grain to address the current grain issue. Premier Zhang also pointed out the inappropriateness of selling off grain when reporting to the Political Council yesterday, and stated that the government intends to expand the scope of grain rationing, so that police, workers, and civilians all have the opportunity to purchase grain. The voucher system is indeed the most effective method for expanding rationing. It is said that although the voucher system is best suited for wartime, it is still used in England and Hong Kong. Implementing this system universally in our country may have technical aspects that require study, but in the current situation, this is the only effective way to stabilize grain prices and eliminate rice rushes in various regions.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The General Manager of the China Grain Company, Tan, stated that the company plans to establish four bases nationwide to universally adjust surpluses and deficits: one in Changsha, to adjust the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway to Guangzhou; one in Wuxi, to adjust Beijing and Shanghai; one in Wuhu, to adjust Northeast and North China; and one in Jiujiang, to adjust the Southwest.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The national military grain quota for May has been reduced by one-fifth compared to April. It will continue to be gradually reduced to avoid affecting civilian food supplies.</p>
<h3>Northern Communist Troops from Songhua River Move South; Northeast Situation Becomes Tense Again; Communists Simultaneously Prevent Defections of Ma Zhanshan's Former Troops</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changchun, 10th] The Northeast Communist troops are restless again, with frequent mobilizations and active deployments in recent days. Approximately 70,000 Communist troops are gathered in the Shulan and Xiushuidianzi areas, known to include the Independent 1st Division, 6th Division, 16th Division, 17th Division, New 20th Division, 2nd Police Brigade, and 5th Police Brigade. A force of 100,000 troops is massed in the Dalai and Fuyu areas, including the 4th Division, 5th Division, Matsuda Unit, Mongolian Cavalry, and six other armies. They are about to launch an offensive on the Jilin-Changchun area from both the east and west, claiming they will launch an offensive mid-month. The Songhua River front remains relatively calm, but Communist troops have transported several trainloads of wooden boats from Qiqihar to Shuangcheng, preparing to cross the river.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changchun, 10th] Small groups of Communist troops invaded Youjiatun, 35 kilometers northeast of Jilin.

National troops are on high alert.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The northwest corner of the Jilin-Changchun area, which had been calm for over fifty days, is now tense again. Large numbers of Communist troops transported south along the (Qiqihar to Siping) railway from north of the Songhua River are actively deploying at Baicheng, along the diagonal line between Dalai and Qian Gorlos Banner. The Changchun-Taonan Railway south of Dalai, which was completely dismantled by the Communist troops last summer, is now being temporarily repaired, seemingly in preparation for strengthening supply efforts in the northern section of the Changchun-Taonan Railway. It is generally expected that after the Songhua River thaws, the Communist troops will threaten the Jilin-Changchun area with pressure from both the east and west ends.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] General Ma Zhanshan has long been trusted by the people of the Northeast. Former puppet Manchukuo soldiers reorganized by the Communist troops greatly admire him.

Lu Zhengcao, Zhang Xueshi, and others specifically convened a meeting of over one hundred regional commanders and political commissars on the 20th of last month at the former Songjiang Provincial Government in Nangang. Chairman Li Lisan discussed detailed measures to prevent Ma's troops from defecting: (1) Thoroughly investigate and monitor Ma's former troops and personnel strength. (2) Issue orders to front-line troops in subordinate areas to pay close attention, and reward officers and soldiers who discover any defections. According to someone familiar with the situation in the Northeast, Ma's former troops in the northern Manchuria area number over 300,000.</p>

<h3>Pro-Democracy Elements in the Chinese Communist Party Launch Anti-Mao Movement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this City] Since Mao Zedong insisted on launching the civil war, pro-democracy elements within the Chinese Communist Party have launched a fierce anti-Mao movement, resolutely opposing Mao Zedong's policy of seizing power through armed struggle, and demanding that Mao end his leftist opportunist struggles. Propaganda materials for this anti-Mao movement have been discovered in various places. Another document, titled "Four Seasons Song," issued by the Propaganda Department of the "Emergency Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Suluyu Border Region Party Committee," set to the tune of the folk song "Meng Jiangnu," expresses undisguised hatred for Mao Zedong's warmongering, which has harmed the country and the people. The original lyrics are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In springtime, cannons roar red,</p>
<p>Mao Zedong has risen in China,</p>
<p>Grasping for power and selfish desires,</p>
<p>Causing unrest among the people.</p>
<p>(2) In summertime, the great war begins,</p>
<p>How many militiamen become cannon fodder?</p>
<p>The Mao bandits are determined to seize the country,</p>
<p>Regardless of the people suffering from war.</p>
<p>(3) In autumn, great disaster descends,</p>
<p>The Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies are deployed,</p>
<p>Alas, the sacrifice is great in battle,</p>
<p>The people suffer, it is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>(4) In winter, famine rages,</p>
<p>The people hunger and suffer,</p>
<p>As long as we unite against the Mao bandits,</p>
<p>Everyone will live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Printed by the Propaganda Department of the Emergency Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Suluyu Border Region Party Committee.</p>

<h3>China and the Philippines Urge MacArthur to Increase Pressure to Force Japan to Hand Over Looted Goods; U.S. Opposes Using Japanese Assets for Occupation Costs</h3>
<p>[United Press, Western Japan Investigation, 10th dispatch on "Looted Goods" train] Today, representatives from China and the Philippines jointly urged MacArthur's headquarters to increase pressure and force Japan to return property looted during the war to various countries. Wu Bannong, head of the Compensation Group of the Chinese Delegation to Japan, said that the war trophies reported by Japan to international investigators to date only cover the surface of China's losses during the Japanese occupation. MacArthur should continue his efforts and increase pressure on Japan to hand them over. Filipino delegation to the reparations committee, Abolera, suggested that MacArthur should strictly order the return of the properties looted by Japan. Based on what he had seen during his weeks of travel in Japan, he knew that Japan had not effectively complied with the order to return the property. Representatives from other countries also expressed the same view. The Allied countries lost no less than 1,500 ships seized by Japan, but only 70 have been found so far. According to Chinese officials, of the 120 ships looted by Japan from China, only four have been returned. The United Kingdom lost no less than 1,300 ships, of which only one has been returned. Some of the 70 ships reported by the Japanese side have already sunk, but they can still be salvaged. One is a 10,000-ton British freighter, salvaged on the northern coast of Honshu, and the other is the 18,000-ton Italian ship Conte Verde, which is also aground in the same port. The ship was sunk in Shanghai in 1943 by Italian sailors, and later salvaged and used by the Japanese.</p>
<p>[United Press, Osaka, 10th] According to Wu Bannong, he asked the Allied headquarters to apply greater pressure and search museums, libraries, and private collections, as these places could also be hiding places for looted goods. One paper mill and one nitric acid plant have already been found and will soon be shipped back to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] According to well-informed sources in diplomatic circles today, the Far Eastern Commission will soon announce its decision to approve the United States' application to oppose the use of Japan's current assets to pay for occupation costs and food relief. The United States has been fighting for this move in the Far Eastern Commission for months, seeking the commission's approval of the U.S. application.</p>
<p>Allied Investigation Team to Search Moats of Imperial Palace for Loot</p>
<p>[United Press, Special train on the south coast of Honshu, 10th] Representatives of the Allied investigation team now in southern Japan told reporters that the authorities may excavate the moats surrounding the Tokyo Imperial Palace to search for gold, silver, and other looted goods that the Japanese army may have hidden there during the war. The Allies are currently conducting a large-scale search for billions of dollars worth of looted goods, which the Japanese seized from various Allied countries during the war and are believed to still be hidden in Japan. Excavating the moats is part of the search effort. The Japanese have been ordered to hand over these items, but Allied officials believe that only a small portion has been received to date. Some investigation team representatives advocate using mine detectors to search for looted goods on land, as this method has been quite effective in Germany.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union did not send a representative to the investigation team this time, claiming that it was not prepared at present. Representatives from China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, the Philippines, and the Netherlands have set off for southern Japan and all agree to continue their efforts to search during the occupation period, as once the peace treaty with Japan is signed, there is little hope of recovering anything that was not specified beforehand.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Japanese Reparations, Wu Bannong Discusses China's Needs, Hoping to Obtain Immediately Applicable Materials</h3>
<p>[United Press, Osaka, 10th] Dr. Wu Bannong, head of the Chinese delegation to Japan, said: "China hopes to extract reparations from Japan's current production. China needs to obtain immediately applicable materials from Japan. In addition to food, China also hopes to immediately obtain all daily necessities as part of the reparations it deserves, such as cloth, locomotives, steel rails, and other materials produced by Japanese factories."</p>
<p>Dr. Wu believes that Japan will never be able to pay all the prescribed reparations. He also knows that Japan must be allowed to maintain a fairly low standard of living. Wu continued: Among the factories currently available for reparations, China needs power plants, hardware tools, factories, shipyards, and chemical plants. The factories obtained through reparations should be distributed throughout the country according to the five-year plan drawn up by Chinese and American experts. The Chinese reparations delegation has visited several factories and found that some of them are of no value to China, while others are of great value, but China lacks ships to transport these factories back home.</p>
<p>China is very disappointed that only a small number of 50-cycle power plants are listed on the Allied headquarters' temporary reparations list. Japan can simultaneously use 50-cycle and 60-cycle power plants, while China uses 50-cycle as the standard. China needs several of these factories, but there are too few that are applicable, so there is virtually no choice.</p>
<p>China also needs iron mills to compensate for the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant that the Soviet Union moved away in the Northeast. China is drafting a reparations list, but the work is very difficult because China's losses from Japan are too great to estimate at this time.</p>
<p>China is eager to cooperate with the Allied headquarters to stabilize the Japanese economy and is planning to supply Japan with coal, coke, and iron ore in exchange for Japanese steel products. It is hoped that this trade can be completed in the near future.</p>
<h3>China's Five-Member Team to Japan Named Reparations Delegation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] China's five-member executive team sent to Japan for reparations matters has now been officially named the Chinese Reparations and Restitution Delegation.

The five-member executive team was established in February this year based on the recommendation of the Allied Headquarters. Each country participating in the Far Eastern Commission sends 50 representatives to cooperate with the Reparations Executive Office established by the Allied Headquarters under the General Staff. It is reported that General Harrison, Director of the Headquarters Reparations Executive Office, will soon organize an executive committee, which will be composed of the chief representatives of the reparations delegations of various countries, and will hold meetings to discuss and propose detailed plans for dismantling and relocation.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 10th] From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. this morning, grain robbery riots occurred simultaneously in Jin, Tu, and Pan gates in Suzhou. More than ten grain shops were robbed, resulting in considerable losses. After receiving reports, the military, government, and police agencies immediately dispatched teams to arrest more than 30 grain robbers. At 2 p.m., the City Defense Department invited the county government and the gendarmerie battalion to hold a joint trial. It was determined that the riots were instigated by traitors, and it was decided to strictly interrogate each of the arrested criminals. Those who were instigated will be paraded through the streets and ordered to compensate for the losses, while the masterminds will be executed. In the evening, the City Defense Department and the county government jointly issued a notice to inform the citizens to trust the government and not to be used by criminals.

<h3>Hefei Limits Rice Exports to 100 Piculs Per Day</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hefei, 10th] Rice prices here have recently fluctuated between 180,000 and 200,000 yuan, and it is difficult to expect them to fall. The direct reason is that rice merchants from various places are snapping up rice at high prices, stimulating the rise. The Anhui Provincial Department of Field and Grain Management recently discussed and decided on two measures to control transportation with relevant agencies: (2) The export of rice from Hefei, except for military grain, shall not exceed 100 piculs per day for the time being; (2) Rice merchants who transport grain exceeding the prescribed amount shall be ordered to sell it on the spot, which shall be handled by the Hefei County Government and the Provincial Capital Police Bureau.</p>
<p>In addition to rice, the prices of all other items have increased by one or two times, and the lives of public officials have been greatly threatened. All the staff of the Anhui Provincial Government signed a petition to Chairman Li yesterday, requesting that each person be allowed to purchase one picul of low-priced rice per month at 60,000 yuan for a period of six months. It is said that Chairman Li has instructed the Department of Field and Grain Management to find a way to handle it. There are currently 5,000 provincial-level civil servants, who need 30,000 piculs of rice in six months. The Department of Field and Grain Management has not yet indicated that it can be handled.</p>

In addition, Nanjing supplies about 2,000 bags per day, and the current flour riots have already passed.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issue of Revising the Economic Emergency Measures Plan</h3>
<p>According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, the government is currently considering revising the previously promulgated Economic Emergency Measures Plan. The draft is being formulated through discussions among relevant ministries such as economics and finance. This news is credible, as Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan previously stated that he believed the plan was no longer suitable and must be revised.</p>
<p>The so-called Economic Measures Plan covers a wide range of content. Which parts are unsuitable and which parts need to be revised have not been explained by the authorities, so it is inconvenient to speculate. However, upon careful examination, some parts were deemed unsuitable from the beginning, such as the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during Extraordinary Times, revised and promulgated in the 27th year [of the Republic]. These regulations were entirely based on economic mobilization methods determined during the military period. The provisions regarding which enterprises should be established or abolished, should be government-run or privately-run, and how to support and control them, were very detailed. Although the civil strife has not subsided and the military period has not completely passed, the government clearly has no preparation for the above measures, and no agency has the power or ability to implement them. It is merely an empty document, ordering "strict enforcement," and the result is, of course, just an empty document. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Some are generally good, but certain clauses have clearly lost their timeliness. For example, the various penalty rules stipulate that cases involving values of 50,000 yuan or more should be transferred to the court for processing, while those less than 50,000 yuan should be punished by the competent authority according to law. Considering current prices, cases with values less than 50,000 yuan are probably non-existent. Therefore, all cases of violating price limits, price negotiations, hoarding, and speculation, regardless of size, must be transferred to the judiciary, which clearly does not conform to the original intention of the legislation at the time. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Some have factual preparations that have not yet been fully completed. For example, regarding the quantitative distribution of essential daily necessities for people's livelihoods, according to the law, all employees and public teachers and staff should be allocated goods according to the quota. Currently, public teachers and staff in Nanjing and Shanghai have implemented the plan, but the quantitative distribution for employees is still being compensated with differential pay. Now, due to the difficulty in purchasing rice, various businesses, factories, and employees are eager to be allocated physical goods and cannot rely solely on differential pay. However, the material supply agencies have not clearly stated whether they have fully prepared for these materials or whether they can legally supply them. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Some have objective conditions that are not met, and it is practically impossible to continue implementing them. For example, freezing the cost-of-living index was predicated on stabilizing prices. Now, with prices rising and living conditions difficult, employees everywhere are striving to unfreeze the index. This principle is considered reasonable even by the management and authorities. Therefore, the provision that the January index is the highest level has practically lost its control. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>Some have restrictions that are too strict, causing industrial and commercial stagnation, and prompt remedies must be sought. For example, the clauses regarding foreign exchange applications and import permits in the matter of developing trade. The import of "certain raw materials and machinery that are necessary for domestic industry" is in principle permitted. However, obtaining import permits and foreign exchange applications is actually very difficult, causing importers and exporters to be in a dilemma, and manufacturers are particularly anxious about the supply of raw materials. This is the fifth point.</p>
<p>Originally, the various plans of the Economic Emergency Measures were unsuitable and had to be revised not only because of the shortcomings in the legislation itself but also because of human factors, namely, the implementation was not satisfactory. To give a few examples, the inappropriate price limits and price negotiations, and the lack of procedures for cracking down on hoarding, have already been pointed out in separate articles in this newspaper. So, to put it simply, the failure of these emergency measures is half congenital, that is, there are too many conflicts in the measures themselves, and half acquired, that is, the promotion has not been effectively carried out. It can also be said that many parts have not been taken seriously at all.</p>
<p>Why have they not been taken seriously! There are various reasons, and the fact that the legislation is too dense and too unreasonable is one of the main reasons. For example, the Regulations on Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation stipulate that almost every move of a merchant must be registered and reported. And all goods, except those that come in one's left hand and immediately go out in one's right hand, are almost always considered hoarding. If the goods are stockpiled and not moved, they must be either purchased or sold by the government at a fixed price, or a location must be designated and forced to be transported and sold. According to these regulations, the so-called adequate inventory and legal profit in the market are hardly applicable in this era.</p>
<p>Therefore, the revision of the current plan must grasp several key points: (1) It must be reasonable, that is, in line with human nature and adapted to the facts. Any rigid provisions that are simply copied, overly subjective, no matter how strict, will ultimately not be effectively promoted. Even if they are forcibly implemented, the result will be nothing more than outward compliance but inner resistance, creating many evils. (2) It must be simple and easy to implement. All unnecessary procedures and useless programs must be eliminated as much as possible, so that businesses and people are happy to comply, and government offices can easily implement them. The people of our country are accustomed to simplicity and enjoy generosity. Moreover, the territory is vast, and customs vary from place to place. It is not advisable to be limited to the experiences of Nanjing and Shanghai, to build a cart behind closed doors, and to rely solely on conjecture, leading to laws and regulations becoming mere formalities and increasing the suffering of businesses and people. (3) It must be decisive. Issues such as unfreezing the cost-of-living index, adjusting the treatment of public teachers and staff, food for the people, import and export issues, etc., are all urgent and must be improved promptly to respond to the situation. If there are delays in deliberation and hesitation, and many extensions are made, it may only lead to more confusion and create more complications. And in the end, we will still have to conform to public opinion, simply damaging the government's prestige. As for all harsh measures and policies that compete with the people for profit, it is hoped that they will be thoroughly eliminated and a new start will be made with the people, in order to work together with one heart and overcome this economic crisis.</p>

<h3>US House Passes Aid Bill for Greece and Turkey; Military Supplies and Relief Goods to Be Shipped to the Middle East</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 9th] The House of Representatives today passed the $400 million aid bill for Greece and Turkey by a vote of 287 to 107. Of those voting in favor, 127 were Republicans and 160 were Democrats. Of those voting against, 93 were Republicans, 13 were Democrats, and 1 was from a minor party. The bill passed today includes the Vandenberg amendment, which stipulates that the President may withdraw aid under the following circumstances: (1) if requested by the governments of Greece and Turkey, representing the majority of the people; (2) if the President receives official notification from the United Nations stating that the Security Council or the General Assembly feels that the actions or assistance taken by the United Nations make it unnecessary for the United States to continue providing aid; (3) if the President believes that the purpose of the bill has been accomplished by the actions of any other international organization, or discovers that the purpose of the bill cannot be satisfactorily accomplished; (4) if the President discovers that the guarantees attached to Section 3 cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] After the House of Representatives today passed the $400 million aid bill for Greece and Turkey by an overwhelming majority to contain the expansion of communism, American munitions, funds, and relief supplies will soon begin to be shipped to the countries of the Middle East in a steady stream. The House rejected more than ten destructive amendments one by one. After some minor disputes are resolved through joint committee discussions, Truman can sign it into law and begin to implement the various measures of the "Truman Doctrine." According to the State Department, of this aid, $300 million will be loaned to Greece, half for military use and half for economic use, and another $100 million will be loaned to Turkey, all for military use. The plan will not involve American troops, but a small number of military advisory groups will be sent to Athens and Ankara to guide the Greek and Turkish armies on how to use American weapons.</p>
<h3>US Pursues Firm Policy to Close the Door to the Middle East</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] The day after the House passed the aid bill for Greece and Turkey, well-informed sources here declared that the future US foreign policy will not only be to use American loans to build up Greece and Turkey, but also to close the door to the Soviet Union in the Middle East.

The Greek government has made progress in this regard, and the United States welcomes it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th, United Press] Democratic members of the House greatly praised a statement made by a certain member that "if the Soviet Union considers the aid bill for Turkey and Greece as a 'declaration of war,' then so be it." This remark was made by Republican Representative Morrow of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the second day of the House's discussion on amending the anti-communist bill.</p>

<h3>Arab Representatives at the UN General Assembly Political Committee Demand an End to the Mandate in the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 9th] The spokesperson for the Arab Higher Committee, Katton, presented his views to the UN General Assembly Political Committee on the afternoon of the 9th, demanding an end to the mandate over Palestine and the establishment of an independent state under Arab control. Katton accused Britain of depriving the Arabs of their basic rights, which violated its mandate provisions. He also demanded an immediate halt to Jewish immigration to the Holy Land. Katton continued, "Arabs do not completely rely on the promises and guarantees made to them, because the most important thing is that the land of Palestine belongs to the Arabs." Katton severely criticized the Balfour Declaration, in which Britain guaranteed the establishment of a Jewish state in the region, and called it the fundamental cause of the conflict there. He also demanded that the United Nations recognize that Britain's mandate is incompatible with the UN Charter. At the same time, when the Special Committee submitted six recommendations to the Political Committee (including instructions to the UN Palestine Investigation Committee, etc.), Soviet Representative Gromyko proposed an amendment requesting the next UN General Assembly to study the issue of immediately establishing an independent state in Palestine.

<h3>French Political Crisis Ends; Auriol Announces New Four Ministers; Deputy Prime Minister Dechevallier Takes Over Torres' Duties</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] After the French Communist Party ministers withdrew from the cabinet, the successors to the vacant positions were nominated by Premier Ramadier last night and appointed by President Auriol: (1) The Minister of Labor will be succeeded by the socialist Gazier; (2) The Minister of Public Health will be succeeded by the Popular Republican Party member Prigent; (3) The Minister of Reconstruction will be concurrently held by the leader of the Popular Republican Party, the current Minister of Commerce, Letourneau; (4) The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications will be succeeded by the socialist Thomas; (5) The Minister of State will be succeeded by the socialist Bethouart. Deputy Prime Minister Dechevallier takes over the duties held by Communist leader Torres. The cabinet now has twelve socialist members, six Popular Republican Party members, five members of the Left-Wing Union, and two non-partisan members. The new cabinet members attended a cabinet meeting this morning to discuss foreign affairs and wheat issues. The issue of wages and prices will be discussed at the cabinet meeting tomorrow; this issue was the cause of the recent cabinet crisis.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet's Position Strengthened After Reorganization</h3>
<p>Communist Party Seems to No Longer Adopt Opposition Actions</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The position of the Ramadier cabinet is more peaceful than before. During the debate on the Madagascar issue, the Communist Party abstained from voting, which seems to indicate that the party is unwilling to take planned opposition actions against the government, and also holds a reserved attitude towards the Overseas Colonies Minister Moutet's point that the Madagascan parliamentarians should be held responsible for the riots. This expression by the Communist Party today can strengthen the government's position. In addition, workers at the Renault car factory have now expressed their acceptance of the government's proposed increase in bonuses, although it is far from their demands.</p>

<h3>The Liberal Party in Japan Suffers a Sudden Blow: Finance Minister Ishibashi Purged; Four Parties Actively Prepare to Form a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The axe of purge fell with a resounding crash yesterday on the three top ministers of the Shigeru Yoshida cabinet: Finance Minister Tanzan Ishibashi, Minister of Commerce and Industry Mitsujiro Ishii, and Justice Minister Tokutaro Kimura. The purge of Ishibashi, who controls the finances of the Liberal Party, is likely to weaken the Liberal Party's position in the current negotiations between the parties. The departure of Ishibashi also led to the collapse of the "Ishibashi Fiscal Policy," which had previously been like a stone wall between the conservatives and the Socialist Party regarding the joint issue.</p>
<p>Katayama's Remarks</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] After the four-party leaders' meeting on the 9th, Chairman Katayama issued a statement saying: The parties have reached a consensus on forming a national unity cabinet. Regarding policy issues, the Socialist Party has previously issued an emergency breakthrough policy and intends to use this as a basis for discussions with the parties. The Socialist Party has not yet put forward its views on the prime minister issue, and the issue of cabinet allocation ratios is still under negotiation. In short, the Socialist Party will not make unreasonable disputes on any issue.</p>
<p>[International News Service, Tokyo, 10th] Regarding the allocation of cabinet ministers in the new cabinet, according to reliable sources, the Socialist, Liberal, and Democratic parties will each get five seats, and the National Cooperative Party will get one seat. This point will be finalized at the four-party secretaries-general meeting on the 12th.</p>
<p>Attitudes of the Parties</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Regarding the four-party secretaries-general meeting to be held on the 12th, the attitudes of the parties are as follows: The Toho Party hopes to decide in the meeting who will serve as prime minister. Other policy issues and cabinet allocation ratios are authorized to be decided by Katayama and Nishio. Secretary-General Ohno of the Liberal Party especially emphasized the fundamental principles of the coalition cabinet and decided to hold an executive meeting again on the morning of the 12th and a general meeting of affiliated parliamentarians in the afternoon to determine the party's official attitude on this issue. On the Democratic Party side, a temporary meeting of affiliated parliamentarians and an executive meeting were convened on the 10th to conduct a comprehensive discussion on the issues of prime minister, policy, and cabinet allocation ratios. As a result, they agreed to assist the Socialist Party on the latter two issues. The National Cooperative Party convened a temporary general meeting of affiliated parliamentarians on the afternoon of the 10th. Regarding policy issues, except for six items such as the New Yuan issue, which opposed the Socialist Party's policies, the rest were agreed upon. Regarding cabinet issues, they hoped that one or two people could enter the cabinet.</p>

<h3>Doctors and Nurses from Health Offices in All Districts of the City Petition to Resign; Director of the Health Bureau Persuades and Reassures Them Separately; Indicates He Will Vigorously Argue with the Mayor on the Issue of Treatment</h3>
<p>Recently, due to soaring prices in this city, the lives of salaried people have been greatly threatened. According to news from the City Health Bureau yesterday, the doctors and nurses serving in the health offices in all districts of the city under the bureau, due to meager treatment, with an average monthly income of only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, which is difficult to maintain a living, have all petitioned to resign, and the situation is very serious. According to Director Zhang of the Health Bureau, regarding the resignation of doctors and nurses from various health clinics, in addition to earnestly persuading them to stay, the issue of treatment still needs to be referred to Mayor Wu for resolution. However, at a time when municipal finances are stretched, how to improve is indeed difficult. Currently, the salaries of civil servants are meager, which is a common phenomenon. However, doctors and nurses are technical talents, and the government should give them a little more preferential treatment. I will be responsible for vigorously arguing on their behalf. Director Zhang recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing after attending the 7th annual meeting of the Chinese Medical Association. Regarding his impressions of this trip, he said that at this conference, he was very happy to hear the grand discussions of medical experts in various subjects from China and abroad, such as Fox (ophthalmology expert), Wu Lien-teh (epidemiology expert), and Wu Hsien (biochemistry expert). Director Zhang said that the biggest difficulty in the current health administration work in our country is the issue of funding.</p>
<h3>To Ensure the Security of Various Suburban Counties of Shanghai: A Ten-County Garrison Conference is Held; Commander Xuan Instructs Seven Methods of Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to discuss matters related to the expansion of the garrison command's jurisdiction, the garrison command convened a ten-county garrison conference at the command headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday. The attendees included Xie Chengbing, inspector of the Third Administrative Region, Yu Yueqiu, magistrate of Shanghai County, Liu Jin, magistrate of Qingpu County, Guo Chunyi, magistrate of Chongming County, Wu Wenming, magistrate of Chuansha County, Xi Chengzhi, magistrate of Fengxian County, Xu Zhuyi, magistrate of Jiading County, Cheng Daomin, magistrate of Baoshan County, Li Yuegang, magistrate of Jinshan County (represented by Li Siguang, captain of the security team), Xu Jinyu, magistrate of Songjiang County (represented by Sun Tianji, chief of the military section), and heads of various military sales agencies in the city, as well as the heads of various departments of the garrison command. The meeting was personally chaired by Commander Xuan and lasted until about 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Based on the reports and reviews of the administrative commissioners and county magistrates at the meeting, the general situation is still good. However, the situation in the three counties of Chuansha, Nanhui, and Fengxian in Pudong is relatively complex, with sporadic bandit activities, but it is not enough to cause concern.</p>
<p>Close discussions were held at the meeting on methods to strengthen contact and consolidate security in the future. It was unanimously decided to thoroughly suppress bandits running rampant in various places in the short term. Commander Xuan immediately gave seven instructions on bandit suppression methods: (1) To ensure local security, it is best to prevent problems before they occur. If bandits have already appeared, the suppression must be thorough. Local military police should cooperate with local armed forces to carry out a comprehensive rural cleanup. (2) Currently, because the urban security forces are strong, bandits with political motives are mostly hiding in remote rural areas. The persons in charge of each county should pay special attention to this point. (3) The armed forces of each county should maintain close contact when suppressing bandits. (4) The suppression of bandits at sea will require the Navy to send warships to assist. (5) If the ammunition supply for the armed forces of each county is insufficient, the garrison command will supplement it as appropriate. (6) After bandits are captured, they will still be punished according to the county's existing punishment methods. (7) If there are any emergencies in each county, the garrison command will definitely dispatch military forces to assist. At 7:00 PM, Commander Xuan hosted a banquet for the attending officials at the Kaige Guishanghai Restaurant on Jiangning Road.</p>

<h3>Two Telecommunications Agencies Fail to Reach Agreement; More Than Two Thousand Employees Begin "Hunger Strike;" Director of the Telecommunications Administration Bureau Comes to Shanghai to Mediate</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] More than two thousand employees of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications demanded the same treatment as postal workers and the issuance of housing subsidies equivalent to one stone of white rice per month. After failing to reach an agreement with the persons in charge of the bureau and station the day before yesterday, both parties took joint action and began a "hunger strike" at 10:00 AM yesterday, ceasing to send and receive commercial telegrams. However, military and news telegrams were still being sent and received as usual.</p>
<p>After the "hunger strike" began, Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, summoned colleagues to a meeting in the workers' dining hall of the bureau on Fuzhou Road and promised to issue the differential salary for the third, fourth, and fifth months and the rice subsidy for the third and fourth months that evening, totaling 290,000 yuan for staff, 214,000 yuan for assistants, and 138,000 yuan for workers. He hoped that work would resume before 12:00 PM. Regarding the issue of demanding the same treatment as postal workers, Yu said that he could go to Beijing with employee representatives to request this from the Ministry of Communications, as he had no authority to agree. The employees stated that they could first issue two stones of rice per person before their above-mentioned demands were met, and then work would resume immediately. Yu did not grant their request, and the negotiations broke down, and the situation remained deadlocked until the evening. Zong Zhifa, the managing engineer of the International Radio Station, summoned representatives of the station's employees several times yesterday, advising them to resume work first and immediately issue the differential salary and rice subsidy of 290,000 yuan. The employees also did not agree.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Director Zhu and Deputy Director Mei of the Telecommunications Administration Bureau arrived in Shanghai by car last night to mediate the employees' demand for adjustments to their treatment.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers Similarly Feel the Hardships of Life</h3>
<p>Remarks by the Chairman of the Labor Union</p>
<p>Wang Zhen, Chairman of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, made a statement yesterday regarding the "hunger strike" of the International Radio Station employees and their demand for the same treatment as postal workers, saying: I deeply sympathize with the International Radio Station workers for their "hunger strike" in order to fight for legitimate living rights, and I hope that they will reach a reasonable solution soon. Regarding the current treatment of postal workers, it is definitely not as rumored by the outside world. The current treatment, such as rice subsidies, in-kind differential payments, etc., has definitely not exceeded the scope of government regulations. The cost of living index has also been frozen since January of this year. Recently, prices have been rising, and the lives of postal workers are also on the verge of desperation.</p>
<h3>To Prepare to Establish a Public Rice Sales Office, First Investigate the Number of Poor People</h3>

It was decided that the police bureau and the civil affairs office would first investigate the number of extremely poor, moderately poor, and laboring class people in each district. Detailed measures will be decided after Director Wu returns to Shanghai and requests instructions.</p>

<h3>Appeal of the Metzburg Case Concluded; Dutch and American Diplomats Attended the Hearing; Sentencing Set for the 17th</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Dutch businessman Metzburg illegally operating in the black market for foreign exchange and foreign currency has been sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the District Court. Metzburg and the prosecutor both disagreed and filed an appeal. The case was heard once on the 3rd. Yesterday morning, the verbal debate was opened in the High Court. Dutch Consul General Miterden, Commercial Counselor Stake of the Embassy, American Consul Anderson, Fraile, and legal advisor Zhang Tianyin all attended the hearing. At 9:30 AM, Judge Liu Yugui, along with Judges Han Shuzhi and Wang Kequan, and Prosecutor Luo, took their seats in Criminal Court 1. The hearing lasted for four hours. The court instructed that the case was closed and the sentence would be announced on the morning of the 17th.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the appellant's attorney, Chen Tingrui, first stated that the reasons for the appeal had been submitted to the court yesterday and a copy had been submitted for reference. Metzburg's testimony was the same as before. The 20,000 Hong Kong dollars were a margin for advance exchange, and the 38 gold bars were deposited by the Lianxin Company. The Eberes Company did not engage in banking business and expressed disagreement with the original judgment. Prosecutor Luo's arguments stated that although the defendant claimed that the 20,000 Hong Kong dollars were not a deposit but a guarantee deposit for the Lei'e Company, the manager of that company testified to this. Therefore, it should be determined to be a deposit and should be regarded as a bank according to the Ministry of Finance regulations. The original trial's reference was not inappropriate. The original trial leniently sentenced the defendant because he was a foreigner and did not understand Chinese law, which was inappropriate. It should be requested that the original judgment be revoked and a more appropriate judgment be made. Subsequently, lawyers Chen Tingrui and Cai Runan stood up to defend, citing classics and elaborating in detail. The main points were: (1) The punishment part of the economic emergency measures program has not yet completed legal procedures and cannot be immediately regarded as law. (2) Even if it can be regarded as law before the Legislative Yuan completes the legal procedures, its effective time in Shanghai should be 00:00 on March 5th, while the occurrence of the facts of this case was far before March 3rd. The Garrison Command searched the Eberes Company on the afternoon of March 3rd. (3) The original judgment exhausted its investigatory powers and pointed out that the Eberes Company was a bank, thus wrongly accusing a person, which was a loss of the spirit of the rule of law. (4) The foreign currency confiscated was not the object of buying, selling, or exchanging, and should not be confiscated according to law. Finally, he requested that the errors of the lower court be corrected, the original judgment be revoked, and the appellant be acquitted.</p>
<h3>The King of Real Estate Reveals Embarrassment: Sun Chunsheng's Suspected Treason Case; Firmly Denies Fundraising to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Sun Chunsheng, the Shanghai real estate tycoon during the enemy and puppet period, being suspected of treason was tried yesterday in the High Court. Sun is forty-seven years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and resides at No. 187 Dunxin Road, engaged in the real estate business. In June of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he served as the executive director and secretary-general of the Shanghai Special City Real Estate Industry Association under the puppet regime and also served as the Chinese manager of the Nichijin Kotsu Real Estate Co., Ltd. In April of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the puppet Nanjing government convened various industry associations in the city at the International Hotel to raise funds to purchase aircraft. The association donated 225,000 puppet yuan. After the victory, he was detained by the Songhu Garrison Command and sent to the High Court for legal action. When Sun was questioned yesterday, he was wearing a blue silk padded robe and often showed a cunning smile. He admitted to the puppet positions charged in the indictment without hesitation. He firmly denied raising funds to purchase aircraft. However, it has been confirmed by the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Office that this was indeed the case. Furthermore, it has been verified by the Shanghai Special Commissioner's Office of the Central Bureau of Statistics that the defendant had many interactions with the Japanese invaders through the introduction of his teacher Zhu Boquan, and then served as the Chinese manager of Nichijin Kotsu Real Estate Co., Ltd., and later as the director and secretary-general of the puppet real estate association. At that time, when the Japanese occupied real estate, he used his position to raise huge sums of money from real estate developers throughout the city to purchase aircraft and献铁 (scrap metal). After being sternly questioned by Judge Ding, the defendant revealed considerable embarrassment. The hearing time was quite long. Because further investigation was needed, it was announced that the hearing would be rescheduled, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Alliance and the Industrial Association Held a Symposium Yesterday to Discuss the Implementation of the Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Federation and the China Industrial Association held a symposium at the China Federation Guest House on Linsen Middle Road at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the implementation of the economic reform plan and invited relevant parties from all walks of life. Dozens of people attended, including Jin Runxiang, Hu Xiyuan, Xu Yongzuo, Shou Jingwei, Wei Youjie, Sun Xiaocun, Tao Guilin, Yu Huancheng, Zhang Mengzhao, Liu Zhifang, etc. First, Chairman Shou Jingwei delivered an opening speech, analyzing each principle listed in the economic reform plan in detail. He especially emphasized the following three points: (1) The Principle of People's Livelihood is the foundation of nation-building. It is urgent to use the huge labor force to participate in production, and the key to governance is to establish credibility. The authorities should focus on restoring their credibility in the future. (2) Protect industrial profits and formulate an overall plan. Factories dismantled from Japan, except for those needed by the government, should be handed over to various industries. The enemy and puppet industries in the country should also be leased to private operation as soon as possible. (3) Stop borrowing grain and establish Changping warehouses to fundamentally stabilize society. Then, Yu Huancheng gave a speech, stating: In the past, the government focused on the party, government, and military and did not pay attention to agriculture, industry, and commerce, so the government often had a disconnect from the suffering of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Previous resolutions to support industry and commerce have always gone in the opposite direction. It is not known that the party, government, and military are consumers, while industry and commerce are producers, and their position is far more important than the party, government, and military. To cultivate the foundation of the country, the government must change its previous concepts and clarify the basic policies, with supporting industry and commerce as the premise. Economist Sun Xiaocun gave a speech, raising four points of opinion on the economic reform plan: (1) The plan itself lacks a prerequisite principle, (2) The institution itself was not mentioned, (3) The increase in currency issuance should not be relaxed in terms of consumption but tightened in terms of production, (4) Various controls and prohibitions must be relaxed. Zhang Mengzhao, representative of the Shenxin Yarn Factory, reported on the various difficulties of the textile industry, believing that the current price limit set by the authorities is less than half of the actual cost, and if it is not improved, it will be difficult for industry and commerce to maintain. Accountant Xu Yongzuo stated that all government controls, directly and indirectly, are destroying production undertakings. He hoped that the government would implement a more benevolent policy so that the people could have the opportunity to rest. Regarding the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index, he believed that although unfreezing is a reasonable method, the basic salaries of general workers have generally increased by four or five times compared to before the war, and they should also be restored to their original state to be fair. Regarding stabilizing the economy, he believed that the current price increases have in fact exceeded the rate of inflation, so he advocated that the government issue "Price Index Bonds" to ensure the value of the currency, so that the people will no longer hoard, and the government can lend the absorbed floating capital at low interest rates for production undertakings. In addition, Wang Ke, Zhu Jianping, Jin Runxiang, Tao Guilin, Li Renzai, Chen Tiaofu, and others also gave speeches one after another. There was a heated discussion on issues such as unfreezing the index, economic policy, industrial and commercial organization, and training. Finally, it was resolved to immediately organize the Finance and Industry and Commerce Committee and the Vocational Youth Training Class to study issues and train young people, and it was decided that each group of committee members would be limited to fifteen people.</p>
<h3>Contracting for Toilet Paper for Public Toilets Won for 345.67 Million</h3>

<h3>A Catalogue of Flowers: A Flower Exhibition in a Bamboo Basket at the Hehsing Park, a Riot of Colors Contending for Beauty</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] A flower exhibition opened at Fuhsing Park yesterday at 5 PM. Over fifty flower shops participated, displaying no fewer than two thousand varieties of fresh flowers.</p>
<p>Many of the flower types are exceptionally rare and precious, seldom seen. Such as foxglove, euphorbia tirucalli, pomegranate red, bougainvillea, clivia, azalea, cineraria, calceolaria… and so on. Exotic flowers and strange herbs, a riot of colors; the exhibition clearly took great effort to arrange. Hsü Tien-hsi, the park administration director, was exhausted yesterday, and advisor Cheng Shih-fu developed a high fever due to overwork. Miss Cheng also became hoarse from being so busy. The exhibition is indeed beautiful; flower arrangements, cuttings, potted plants, flower vases… each category has its special appeal. Harmonious colors, aesthetic arrangements, all captivating.</p>
<p>Among the many flowers, the bougainvillea is the most unique, and the color is also the most beautiful, a light rose red, the petals are triangular, growing very closely together. The green leaves are smaller than the petals, so from afar, you only see a pink hue. It is said that this is a kind of azalea, but belongs to a precious category.</p>
<p>The appearance of the foxglove is like an inverted bell, or like a large trumpet in an orchestra. When placed together with the fuchsia, it becomes a world of bells.</p>
<p>The golden iris and the pure white lily, though ordinary, become particularly pleasing when arranged in the same vase, just as a water lily lying next to a hibiscus flower is even more delicate.</p>
<p>The poppy should be wicked, but its bright and dazzling colors far surpass the carnation.</p>
<p>A visit to the flower exhibition can temporarily make you forget the troubles of the world. It is said that the park administration plans to hold two flower exhibitions every year, vine flowers in the first half of the year, and chrysanthemums in the second half of the year. It doesn't cost much money, and it benefits the body and mind, so it is a good adjustment to life.</p>
<p>The park administration also scheduled a flower arrangement competition at Fuhsing Park at 4 PM on the 12th. The administration has prepared more than a hundred flower vases of various sizes and dozens of kinds of fresh flowers for participants to freely choose from, and has invited famous experts to serve as judges. More than twenty female students from St. John's University, Nantong University, Aurora University and women from all walks of life have registered to participate. The list is as follows: Chu Ju-kung (female doctor), Hsieh Tsai-chin (daughter of famous painter Hsieh Hsien-ou), Chu Chih-min (female disciple of famous painter Tao Leng-yue), Ke Yun-yi (daughter of Ke Ching-en), Huang Min-yi, Lin Kuan-hung, Wan Yen-fang, Wang Hsia-hsuan, Huang Miao-ling, Tang Ku-ching (all female students of the St. John's University Agricultural College), Huang Chen-chieh, Tang Chi-hui, Ren Chia-heng, Kao Hui-ching (all female students of Nantong University), Wu Kuo-chen (Aurora University female student).</p>
<h3>A Tangled Web of Impersonation and Assuming Guilt: Iron Shop Owner Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods Shifting Responsibility, Exposed</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Judge Tsao Tsu-wei of the District Court yesterday heard a public prosecution case of receiving stolen goods. At the beginning of the trial, the plaintiff suddenly pointed out that the defendant appearing in court was an impostor. However, the name of the defendant on the summons matched the name of the defendant on the indictment, creating a confusing and amusing situation.</p>
<p>It turns out that a citizen, Tan Pao-chung, passed by the entrance of an iron shop on Chuchiachui Road earlier this month and saw a pile of scrap iron inside the shop, about 430 catties, which he immediately recognized as the goods stolen from him a few days ago. He immediately reported it to the police, who took the shop owner into custody for questioning. The owner identified himself as Wu Yao-ting, the manager of the iron shop, and said that he purchased the ironware from a peddler on the 24th of last month. The police station transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The prosecutor indicted him for the crime of receiving stolen goods, and Wu Yao-ting was released on bail. Yesterday, the defendant Wu Yao-ting reported and appeared in court, admitting that he was the manager of the iron shop, and also the person who bought the stolen goods, and said: He had responded to the summons of the police station and the District Prosecutor's Office. However, the plaintiff insisted: This was not the person who was interrogated at the police station and the District Prosecutor's Office, and he would definitely not mistake him. The court immediately ordered the bailiff to accompany the plaintiff to Chuchiachui Road to arrest the real "Wu Yao-ting" and bring him to court, and suspended the trial. Soon, the person was arrested. He identified himself as Wu Chen-sheng, a shareholder of the iron shop, and pointed to the defendant in court, saying: "His name is Wu Yao-ting, he is the manager, but my name is filled in on the business license." The plaintiff then pointed to Wu Chen-sheng and said: He was the one who was interrogated at the police station and the District Prosecutor's Office, claiming to be Wu Yao-ting. Judge Tsao believed that these two people, one impersonating another's name and the other taking another's blame, were both suspicious, and transferred them together to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Gang of Thieves Steal a Large Amount of Warehouse Paint, Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] At around 8 AM on the 4th, Yeh Hsin-fu reported to the Chiangning Police Branch that between 10 PM on the 3rd and 6:30 AM the next morning, the warehouse of Junghua Industrial Raw Materials Company at No. 15, South Yaochiaohang, Yenping Road, was stolen of 27 barrels of paint of considerable value. Chief Chen of the branch instructed section chief Chen Kai-chou to start the investigation. From 10 AM to 12 PM on the 7th, officers Wu Yun-ching, Wang Chi, police chief Ku Yin-hsuan, policemen Chu Szu-hui, Li Hung-chun, and Tan Yang-sheng successively arrested 13 suspects including paint broker Cheng Po-sung, Chang Wei-chin, Hu Yung-ning, Chou Szu-yi, Yang Chia-jui, Tang Yu-chang, Chu Ming-tsai, Pan Han-hsiang, Tang Chi-yi, Chien Ching-shui, Chien Hsiao-kang, and Chien Kuang-hua at various locations including Chiuchiang Road, Mengyuan Hostel on Fukien Road, No. 464 Chuelu Hotel, No. 40, Lane 306, Matang Road, and No. 614 Wukung Hotel, and seized 19 barrels of stolen goods.

<h3>Jardine Matheson Company's Housing Lease Lawsuit:</h3>
<p>Second Instance Verdict Favors Kwangsin</p>
<p>In October of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), Jardine Matheson Company, a British firm located at No. 110 Chungcheng East Road, signed a contract to lease the entire three-story building of its newly built "Ta Lu" to Kwangsin Banking Corporation. However, before the decoration was completed and the bank could move in, the Pacific War broke out, and the enemy occupied all of Jardine Matheson's buildings for military use, causing Kwangsin immeasurable losses. After the victory, Jardine Matheson believed that the pre-war lease was no longer valid and refused to allow Kwangsin to move in, leasing the three-story building to Texaco Oil Company instead. Yang Tung-yi, the general manager of Kwangsin, filed a lawsuit in court. The first instance ruled against him. Unwilling to accept this outcome, he appealed to the High Court. Yesterday, the High Court announced its verdict, overturning the original judgment and confirming that Kwangsin Banking Corporation had the right to lease the aforementioned building. It is expected that Jardine Matheson will file a third appeal. If they fail, Texaco will have to find another location to relocate, it is said.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Hosted Capital Reporters Yesterday to Explain the Benefits of the Secondary School Graduation Examination, Presided Over by Director Tsao of the Secondary Education Department</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanking, May 10th] The Ministry of Education hosted capital reporters at 3 PM today, presided over by Director Tsao of the Secondary Education Department, to explain the benefits of the secondary school graduation examination as follows: (1) The standards of secondary schools across the country vary greatly, and setting a standard examination for core subjects is the most ideal way to gradually bring them closer. (2) Many public and private schools are run conscientiously, but there are also those that are simply filling positions. The Ministry regularly sends inspectors to various regions to supervise, and then uses the examination to allow people in society to understand their strengths and weaknesses, so that young students have a choice. The Ministry provides various rewards and assistance to schools that are run conscientiously, and further urges those that are run less well. (3) The results of the examination can enable those in charge of education to discover the shortcomings of the education policy and seek ways to remedy them. He added: Major decisions in education are not only the opinion of the Minister, nor are they only the opinion of a few people in the Ministry, but are decided after careful consideration by education experts across the country. If the examination system should be abolished, it can be proposed at the National Education Conference to be held in the autumn and discussed and studied with experts. The joint examination method for the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the presidents of colleges and universities in Shanghai, which combines the examination with the university entrance examination, has been approved by the Minister and ordered to be implemented by the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities and colleges and universities.</p>

(2) The examination in all provinces and cities will be organized by the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus and the committees organized by the universities. (3) The committee will be responsible for the matters of question setting, grading, invigilation, examination affairs, and scoring. (4) Before the examination, candidates should fill out the desired study or employment options after graduation, and if they wish to study further, they should indicate the schools and departments they wish to enter in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth places, but only those university departments participating in the examination are allowed. (5) The examination subjects are limited to five subjects: Chinese, foreign language, arithmetic, physics and chemistry (biology), and history and geography. (6) The scope of the questions will follow the curriculum standards issued by the Ministry. (7) Students who wish to study further and whose scores meet the admission standards of the universities will be admitted to the universities according to their wishes. (8) High school general subject graduates who participate in the examination and whose scores meet the admission standards of the universities will pass the high school graduation examination, and those who do not pass the university admission but meet the pass standards of the examination will also be included in the high school graduation results.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Handle Chiao Tung University Student Unrest</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanking, May 10th] Regarding the student unrest at Shanghai Chiao Tung University, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education stated on the 10th: The Ministry of Education has no intention of changing Chiao Tung University into a college, or changing the College of Management into a department. The Ministry has already considered and handled the students' request to increase funding and faculty positions. The suspension of new student enrollment in the marine engineering and navigation departments is because the Wusong Merchant Marine Vocational School has been restored. As for Tangshan Institute of Technology and Peiping Railway Institute, they have been separated for a long time and it is difficult to merge them. The Ministry of Education has sent Director He to Shanghai to handle this matter.</p>

<h3>British University Petition Students Have Withdrawn from Railway Line; Petition Issues Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Ying Shih University students, demanding relocation of the university, have obstructed the Shanghai-Hangzhou traffic. The Ministry of Education has successively dispatched Xiang Ju-tan, Zhou Hong-jing, and Hang Li-wu to Hangzhou to persuade them. It is reported that after Hang Li-wu arrived in Hangzhou and persuaded the students, they gradually repented. The students who had advanced to Jianqiao have returned to Hangzhou, and the students at the station have also left. This matter may be resolved smoothly.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Tian's Remarks</p>
<p>Education Vice Minister Tian Pei-lin stated on the 10th regarding the Ying Shih University issue: Ying Shih University students have repeatedly demanded the relocation of the university. Although explanations have been given repeatedly, they still indulge in their old habits, gathering crowds to coerce, and making long-distance petitions, even obstructing traffic and disturbing society. The Ministry is currently striving to rectify the academic atmosphere and will absolutely not allow them to insist on their demands by gathering a crowd, nor will it show any leniency. Currently, Vice Minister Hang and Director Zhou, among others, have successively gone to Hangzhou to enlighten and earnestly hope that these students will promptly repent, return to school to attend classes, and not act rashly, falling into error without realizing it.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, which has been suspended for three days and two nights, is expected to resume traffic tonight.</p>
<p>Chairman Shen's Persuasion</p>
<p>The more than 500 petitioning Ying Shih University students, having accepted Chairman Shen Hong-lie's repeated persuasion, in order to consider the welfare of passengers and avoid being falsely accused of disrupting traffic, have therefore withdrawn from the railway line. This evening, they were transported in batches from Jianqiao back to Hangzhou by vehicles dispatched by the provincial government, and will reside in the Zhejiang University College of Agriculture, to further discuss the overall results with the Ministry of Education. The Railway Bureau has dispatched personnel to repair the tracks that were damaged yesterday and prepare locomotives. Two special trains may be dispatched to Shanghai tonight to alleviate the urgent needs of passengers. A portion of the passengers, having exhausted their travel funds, gathered to petition the Provincial Government Executive Office, which is now raising funds from various businesses to provide them with relief.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Hang's Order</p>
<p>Vice Minister Hang Li-wu arrived in Hangzhou yesterday. This morning, he met with student representatives and spoke for five minutes, conveying Chairman Chiang's hand-delivered order, stating that if the students do not return to Jinhua, they will be disbanded. After Chairman Shen mediated, the students agreed to leave Jianqiao to restore traffic. Regarding the petition issue itself, the two sides' opinions are still difficult to reconcile.</p>
<p>Ying Shih University Students Issue Statement</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 10th] After Vice Minister Hang's meeting, the students of Ying Shih University issued a statement, stating that the disruption of Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway traffic was not caused by them, but by the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Education. The students have now withdrawn from the railway to the Huajia Ancestral Hall College of Agriculture in Hangzhou to negotiate with Vice Minister Hang again. Whether or not traffic will resume on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line after it has been vacated is a matter for the Railway Bureau. According to the students' statement to reporters, the issue of relocation was proposed by former President Yang Gong-da. They are now surprised to see Yang's published remarks and express unanimous anger towards Yang. It is also reported that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway may be connected by train tomorrow.</p>
<p>Former President of Ying Shih University Discusses Relocation Issue</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The demand for relocation by students of the National Ying Shih University in Jinhua has attracted much attention from various parties. This reporter specifically visited the university's former president, Yang Gong-da, who stated: "Since I was ordered to serve as the president of the university at the end of August last year, I have actively repaired the school buildings in Jinhua, hired professors to handle admissions, and carried out the restoration of the school. On November 20th, classes started as planned. In the past few months, the Ministry has allocated funds to enrich the school's facilities, purchased a large number of books and instruments, and established an independent power supply. Therefore, the equipment is not inferior to that of other schools. The construction of permanent school buildings has also been approved by the Ministry in stages, with instructions to conduct on-site surveys. Unfortunately, I developed asthma and could not be cured for a long time. Due to physical exhaustion, I obtained the Ministry's approval to resign, and the Dean of the College of Engineering, Zhou Shang, was appointed as acting president. I am deeply saddened to hear that the students are requesting relocation and planning to petition in the capital. However, the school's foundation has just been laid, and the planning for the construction of permanent school buildings has just begun. I hope that the students of Ying Shih University will understand the efforts of the school, take care of their studies, and appreciate the Ministry of Education's utmost care, and continue their studies as usual. It would be most fortunate for the school. As for my inability to continue working at the school due to illness, I feel deeply responsible."</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Students Went on Strike Yesterday and Will Petition in the Capital Within Days; Slogans All Over Campus Accuse Ministry of Discrimination</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] National Jiaotong University students, angered by the Ministry of Education's decision to abolish the school's navigation and marine engineering departments, and by the Ministry of Education's plan to close the school's science and management colleges and turn it into a purely transportation engineering college, began a strike yesterday to express their protest. Slogans and cartoons were posted everywhere on campus, declaring, "Jiaotong University will not tolerate discrimination, Jiaotong University will not tolerate division." The School Protection Corps, organized by the students, also mimeographed "Express News" to contact classmates and report on the progress of the work. As of yesterday afternoon, more than 1,500 students from 42 classes had signed up to join the School Protection Corps. All students are preparing to petition in the capital within days. The traveling organization will consist of small teams of ten people each, and a medium team of five small teams. Female students will form a separate team. The responsible persons of the corps have already contacted the train, ship, and automobile sectors to address transportation issues. It is reported that a major shipping company has agreed to assist with the shipping part.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Student Self-Government Association of Jiaotong University has scheduled a reception for reporters from this city at 2:00 PM today (the 11th) at No. 12 Gongchuo Hall of the school in Xujiahui, where they will report on the progress of the strike. According to the person in charge of the association, "Because of the Ministry of Education's discrimination against Jiaotong University, in addition to suspending the two subjects of Navigation and Marine Engineering, it is also intended to force the closure of the two departments of Water Conservancy and Textile Engineering which have already been established. Moreover, according to Minister Zhu, Jiaotong University should absolutely belong to an engineering school, so the College of Science and the College of Management will also be adjusted. As for the fact that the funding is much less than other schools, it is already a fact, so we decided to go on strike from the 9th and will petition in the capital."</p>
<p>President Wu of Jiaotong University Discusses Trip to the Capital for Negotiations</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch] According to President Wu Bao of Jiaotong University, "This time I went to the capital to ask the Ministry of Education for instructions on handling the two subjects of Marine Engineering and Navigation. The Ministry stated that the two subjects were originally entrusted to this school by the Chongqing Merchant Marine Vocational School. After the post-war recovery, the school has been restored, so it was merged last summer vacation, and the new students were sent to that school. The original senior students of the two subjects will still remain in this school and continue to study until graduation. As for wanting to change the two subjects to departments, it is inconsistent with the academic system. Because Marine Engineering and Navigation are purely technical training, there is no need to run departments in the university, because there is no such precedent in various countries. As for the rumors that Jiaotong University will be renamed, and that the College of Science and the College of Management will be abolished, the Ministry has no such statement."</p>
<h3>Inter-Port Football Match: Shanghai Defeats Hong Kong Two to One; Shanghai Team Comes from Behind, First Half Ends with No Score</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The second inter-port football match of this season between Shanghai and Hong Kong teams took place at Yiyuan at 4:30 PM yesterday. After winning the municipal championship, this was Shanghai's first grand inter-port match. Relying on its strong defense and sharp offense, the Shanghai team ultimately defeated the Hong Kong team 2-1, regaining the inter-port cup and avenging the defeat at the Nongjiao Field in Hong Kong. The first half ended with no score. The military and police worked hard to maintain order yesterday, so the situation was good. There were approximately 15,000 spectators, and a total of more than 9,000 tickets were sold. The police band played music at the venue, creating a lively atmosphere. The line-ups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Team</p>
<p>McNitty, Yan Shi-xin, Wu Qi-xiang, Han Long-bo, Tie Fu-ni, Gao Bao-zheng, Li Yao, Sun Jin-shun, Shou De-hua, Han Long-hai, Fu En</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team</p>
<p>Glassick, Xie Jin-hong, Hou Rong-sheng, Feng Kun-sheng, Que Li, Liu Song-sheng, Cao Qiu-ting, Zou Wen-zhi, Xiao Li-er, Sullivan, Xie Jin-he</p>
<p>General Trend of the Battle</p>
<p>The battle was tense throughout, but lacked highlights. The first half ended without a score, and many players were injured. Cao Qiu-ting of the Hong Kong team was the first to injure his ankle and leave the field, followed by Fu En and Han Long-hai of the Shanghai team, which affected the strength of both sides. The Shanghai team's victory yesterday was mainly due to the excellent performance of the defense. Although the Hong Kong forwards were brave, they found it difficult to overcome the three defensive lines. Gao Bao-zheng ran all over the field, and Yan Shi-xin was steady and reliable. The forwards lacked cooperation somewhat, and Fu En was injured, while Old Sun's speed decreased significantly. Yesterday's victory was not easy. The Hong Kong team's defense was not as good as Shanghai's, and although the forwards were strong, they could not break through Shanghai's defense, and ultimately succumbed.</p>
<p>Numerous Injuries</p>
<p>Referee He Chun-hui, linesmen Wu Shou-heng and Chen Ji-xiang, the great battle began at 4:30. The match adopted the British system and could not be adjusted. The Shanghai team kicked off and took the offensive first. Edward advanced quickly in the middle, but was blocked by Que Li. Xiao Hui-er broke through alone, but Yan Shi-xin carelessly missed, and fortunately McNitty rushed out to prevent a major disaster. At 5 minutes, Sullivan collided with Yan Shi-xin while fighting for the ball, injuring his head. He was bandaged and re-entered the field. The Shanghai team's attacks were unsuccessful. At 13 minutes, the Hong Kong team advanced with five forwards, and Sullivan penetrated deep. Fortunately, Yan Shi-xin shoveled out, averting danger. Two minutes later, Cao Qiu-ting and Xie Jin-hong flew together on both wings, and the Shanghai team's goal was in danger. At 19 minutes, Cao Qiu-ting injured his ankle and left the field, and the Hong Kong team played with ten men.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>
<p>At 23 minutes, the Hong Kong goalkeeper took a step while holding the ball and was penalized with a penalty kick. Fu En took the penalty, and Long-hai received the ball and shot, but was too hasty and missed a good opportunity. At 30 minutes, Long-hai also left the field due to an ankle cramp. Both sides were left with ten men. The melee lasted until 35 minutes, when Han Long-hai re-entered the field, while Fu En withdrew due to a recurrence of an old leg injury. The first half ended with a score of 0-0.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Army Breaks Through the City</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, the visiting army still appeared with ten men, and the Shanghai team Fu En re-entered the field. In the kick-off, the Hong Kong army advanced quickly. Sullivan and Zou Wen-zhi had a tacit understanding, and Xun Hui-er窜冷路 came out. Wu Qi-xiang failed to block in time, and McNitty's save was slightly delayed, and it actually entered the net, and with a score of 1 to 0, the Hong Kong army reported a victory first. The Shanghai team lost a city, and was not willing to, and the three armies advanced quickly. However, the defense of Hou Rong-sheng and Que Li was tight and there was no gap to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Long-Hai Scores Twice</p>
<p>Until 9 minutes, Sun Iron-Leg dribbled the ball behind and passed it to the left corner from afar. Li Yao lightly lobbed the ball in front of the Hong Kong army gate. General Han descended from the sky and headed the ball. Glassick did not guard against this move and thus gave up the defense with a score of 1 to 1, and the Shanghai team drew the game. After that, the Shanghai team's morale was strong, and the Hong Kong army's hinterland was ravaged. Edward 德羣 Fu En and Han Long-hai and others had many chances to attack the door, and Glassick was extremely busy. Until 18 minutes, Sun Jin-gu and Han Long-hai began to encircle and suppress. Long-hai got a chance in the open space and caught up with a kick and a score of 2 to 1, and the Shanghai team turned defeat into victory again. Fireworks burst out and cheers were thunderous. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Hong Kong army tried its best to counterattack. Sullivan Xiao Hui-er Zou Wen-zhi and others had many wonderful shots, but they were either wild or were caught by McNitty. Both sides were exhausted until the last quarter of an hour before the end of the melee. The statutory time came to an end, and the Shanghai team reversed the defeat with a score of 2 to 1</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Women's Basketball Finals: Green Team Wins Championship Yesterday</h3>
<p>47 to 26 White Team Lost After Hard Battle</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The final for the Mayor's Cup basketball women's group was held yesterday. As a result, the Green Team won the championship with 47 to 26 against the White Team. The Green Team took the lead in the first half with 24 to 9.</p>
<p>Both the Green Team and the White Team each had new members participating yesterday. Cai Bao-qiu, the Chongde defender, played for the Green Team, and Nie Bao-zhu, the former captain of the White Team, also played. Wang Shan rushed back from the University Games, and her love of sports is commendable. Liu Zhen-bao, the Green Team's "sharpshooter," scored 34 points alone, which was breathtaking. Although Wang Hui-ling of the White Team fought hard, it was difficult to match her.</p>
<p>The Green Team served the ball, and Huang Ming-yuan took the lead. Liu Zhen-bao's free throws were all successful, and they quickly reached 8 to 0. The White Team changed Zhu Jia-zhen to Guo Ai-zhen, but there was still little improvement. At 12 to 0, they requested a timeout. Wang Hui-ling won a goal, and the first quarter was 14 to 2.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Concerned About the Food Supply of the Citizens, Telegraphs Order to Protect Legitimate Grain Merchants; Most Rice Shops Reopen Yesterday But Have No Goods for Sale</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Following multiple rice-grabbing incidents in the city in recent days, many rice merchants closed their doors and suspended business. The Municipal Government recently received a telegram order from Chairman Chiang regarding the food issue, instructing that assistance be provided to legitimate grain merchants in handling the purchase and sale of grain, and that local administrative organs in various places should provide protection and convenience. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government immediately transferred it to the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus and also sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for their information. At the same time, it notified the relevant trade association to inform its members and posted notices in both the northern and southern markets, urging them to operate with peace of mind and not to panic, in order to maintain the food supply for the people. In particular, they were not allowed to hide or destroy rationed rice, and they were also not allowed to raise the market price of white粳 rice and hoard it for speculation.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Dumped 18,000 Bags Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, more rice shops opened than the day before, but most rice counters were empty. Transactions in the southern market were suspended, while 3,268 shi of goods arrived in the northern market. Top-quality white粳 rice was quoted at 300,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 275,000 yuan. Top-quality Bo Dao rice was quoted at 295,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 280,000 yuan. Top-quality early rice was quoted at 280,000 yuan, and medium-quality at 275,000 yuan. Top-quality Yang Xian rice was quoted at 290,000 yuan, medium-quality at 280,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 275,000 yuan. Top-quality milled Xian rice was quoted at 270,000 yuan, and medium-quality at 265,000 yuan. Top-quality Bu Xian rice was quoted at 275,000 yuan, medium-quality at 270,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 264,000 yuan. Top-quality Bai Yuan rice was quoted at 305,000 yuan, medium-quality at 295,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 285,000 yuan. Medium-quality Yin Yuan rice was quoted at 295,000 yuan. Because rice merchants refused to accept the rationed 9,000 bags of rice when they petitioned on the 8th, the Social Affairs Bureau carried out a supplementary allocation yesterday, so a total of 18,000 bags were dumped. The price remained at 147,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Good Order in Rice Shops That Opened</p>
<p>A slogan with red characters on a black background, posted by some rice merchants, was found in the southern market yesterday morning. The content was very provocative. Ji Mingqi, the Section Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, took it away after discovering it at the market, in order to avoid trouble. According to Section Chief Ji, he inspected rice shops in various districts yesterday morning. Two-thirds of the 2,240 rice shops in the city had opened, but most had no goods for sale. Those who had rice to supply maintained good order, and there were no signs of panic buying. It is believed that all rice shops in the city will be able to resume business completely by the 12th (Monday).</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Slightly Rebound</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks rose and fell with Chinese stocks yesterday. They opened higher.

<h3>Various Industries Actively Subscribing to US Dollar Bonds and Treasury Bills</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The US Dollar Bond Sales Committee held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank, inviting responsible persons from various industry associations. Many representatives from the hardware, cotton cloth, and other industries attended. Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Committee, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Jilou, Vice Chairmen, successively delivered speeches. Secretary-General Xi Lun and Deputy Secretary-General Fan Heyan explained the significance of the treasury bills and bonds, as well as the method of repayment and interest payment.

Other trade associations, such as hardware, drama, securities, rayon, real estate, and iron industries, will subscribe as much as possible after convening a members' meeting to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Are Difficult to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market saw a tendency for prices to rise rather than fall due to the rumored passage of a resolution at the Nanjing Economic Commission's price conference to unfreeze the workers' cost of living index and issue wages according to the new method, which would increase the cost of yarn factories. However, tight credit in the market seemed to curb the rise slightly, and the acceptance by out-of-town buyers was also sluggish. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn reached a high of 12.4 million yuan, only up 400,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was 6.65 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan. Other yarns, such as 20-count and 16-count, rose by varying amounts, from 100,000 yuan to 300,000-400,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Cloth Market Situation is Fluctuating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened still hovering in a weak position. The asking price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was once as low as 258,000 yuan. Then, the news of the recovery of securities spread, and retail investors rushed to buy, causing the price to rise. The final price was 260,000 yuan, similar to the previous day. Opinion was divided on the Four Gentlemen Golden Seal serge. Ultimately, due to the large number of buyers, the price rose to 260,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, dyed cloth, and Shilin cloth saw a cautious market due to tight credit, with the market showing a fluctuating trend.</p>
<p>The Textile Construction Company supplied more than 30 types of cotton cloth as usual, available for purchase at retail stores and cloth shops, but the number of applicants was not enthusiastic. 12-pound Blue Chicken fine cloth was priced at 234,000 yuan, and second-grade Four Gentlemen yuan serge was priced at 235,000 yuan, with little change from the previous period.</p>
<h3>New Banknotes Shipped from England to Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bank Prepares to Expand Loans for Small-Scale Industries, Increasing the Amount Per Household to One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bank previously handled loans for small-scale handicrafts in the city. The first loan was 200 million yuan, which was later increased to 500 million yuan. Now, the Municipal Council has resolved to request the Municipal Government to instruct the bank to expand its operations. It is learned that the bank has been preparing to handle this after receiving the order and has formulated several points for the loan method: (1) The loan amount per household will be increased to 1 million yuan, with a term of six months. Half of the principal and interest must be repaid after three months, and the remainder must be repaid upon maturity. The interest rate is calculated at 0.5% per month. (2) The loan application procedures will also be simplified as much as possible. First, the respective trade associations will prepare a letter to the bank to collect a certain number of application forms, etc., and distribute them to their loan members. After filling them out, they will find a reliable guarantor and use their own industrial equipment as collateral. The association will then be responsible for verifying and sending them to the bank. After review and verification, each loan recipient will be directly notified to collect the funds with their original seal.</p>
<h3>Rayon Steady</h3>

<h3>Tea Market Wants to Improve But Lacks Strength</h3>
<p>The foreign estate tea market, which has been sluggish for a long time, has still not seen a turnaround. This is because buying interest continues to be sluggish, and sentiment wants to improve but lacks strength. As for various domestic sales teas, supply and demand are balanced, and they remain in a consolidation situation. However, the Anhui baked green tea and pearl jasmine tea from last year, which are needed by the Tianjin Gang, are affected by empty warehouses. Although transactions appear and disappear intermittently, the market is firmer than before, and prices are becoming more stable.</p>
<h3>Seafood Market Situation is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Seafood prices have already reached their peak. Recently, affected by tight credit, merchants are trying to sell, so all goods are sluggish. There is a continuous supply of shrimp tails. Except for Jinshan tails, all grades have fallen by about 10%. The arrival and sales of sea cucumbers and shark fins are rare, and the trend is flat and weak. Squid, sea dragonflies, and wood ear mushrooms are weak due to sluggish sales. However, the production areas for shiitake mushrooms have already been cleared, and all grades in stock have been refrigerated in preparation for summer sales, so they remain firm. Other goods are expected to decline further due to weak transactions.</p>
<h3>Paint Manufacturing Industry Faces Many Difficulties, Hoping the Government Will Allocate Raw Materials and Limit the Import of Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Paint Manufacturing Industry Association has 22 members, and there are about a dozen more who have not joined. Among them, the Zhenhua Paint Factory is the largest in scale, with a maximum monthly output of 499 tons of various paints and enamels. The current actual monthly output is only 50 tons, about one-tenth of the maximum output. The maximum monthly output of paint in the city is 2,000 tons, with Zhenhua accounting for about one-quarter. The current actual monthly output is 600 tons, with Zhenhua accounting for about one-twelfth. In addition, the monthly output of spray paint and varnish is about 15 tons each. The current difficulties of the industry and the suggestions to the government are as follows: (1) The industry needs 30 kinds of raw materials, including oils, gums, pigments, and thinners. It is hoped that the government can allocate them at low prices; (2) The industry hopes that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will stipulate paint standards; (3) It is advisable to distribute the paint factories to be established in the future to other cities, and not concentrate them in Shanghai; (4) The industry hopes to send people to participate in the paint factories compensated by Japan; (5) For manufactured products that are already produced in China, please ask the Import and Export Interim Control Commission to limit the import of foreign goods as much as possible; (6) A part of the industry's raw materials must rely on foreign goods. In order to avoid the monopoly of importers, it is proposed to form a joint purchasing office, and it is requested that the government allow them to purchase directly from foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Cocoon Production and Sales Guidance Association Stipulates Prices for Various Fresh Cocoons, Converts to Rice Prices and Telegraphs the Provincial Government for Announcement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The second committee meeting of the Silkworm Cocoon Production and Sales Guidance Association was held at the office of China Silkworm Company on Wujin Road yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. More than 20 people attended, including Xu Baiyuan, Ma Baozhi, Zhang Yu, Tan Xihong, Chen Junren, Ye Yao, Pi Zuoqiong, He Beiheng, Liu Gongyun, Wang Ziji, Wang Botian, Yan Ze Zhi, Ge Jingzhong, Tang Xixiang, Xia Daoxiang, Leng Yuqiu, Chu Fucheng, and Fan Chongshi.

Branch offices have been set up in Wuxi and Hangzhou, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, respectively, to urge manufacturers to rent cocoon houses and establish cocoon collection teams.</p>
<h3>Wool Textile Industry Association Requests Allocation of Sheep Wool from the Hsing Chen General Office</h3>
<p>The Wool Spinning Industry Association held a members' meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday, attended by more than 50 members. Cheng Nianpeng, Ge Jiexun, Wu Ruigeng, Tang Junyuan, Tong Shuangyang, and others served as the presidium. In addition to the report by Cheng Nianpeng, chairman of the association, and Yang Liren, secretary, on the progress of the association's affairs and the accounting of income and expenditure, the following important resolutions were passed: (1) The name of the association was changed to the Shanghai Wool Textile Industry Association, abbreviated as Wool Textile Association. (2) The second quota for wool imports of US$2 million is still far from sufficient. The association should strive for a wider third quota to maintain the operation of the factories. Otherwise, it will be decided to allow them to stop production. (3) For raw materials for which payment has been made before February 17th of this year, the association should promptly request the Import and Export Control Commission to allow them to be imported. (4) All of the current annual wool owned by the Hsing Chen General Office should be allocated to the association by the association to be distributed to its member factories to maintain operation. The distribution method for members will be based on the consumption of each factory and allocated fairly. (5) The membership fee will be increased from 10,000 yuan per unit to 50,000 yuan per unit. (6) The membership fee will be changed to 4 million yuan for the intermediate level, 3 million yuan for the B level, 2 million yuan for the C level, and 1 million yuan for the D level.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Situation</h3>
<p>Recently, the various hardware goods have been affected by the crazy rise of gold tickets in the black market, the soaring price of rice, and the possible unfreezing of the cost of living index. All manufactured goods have risen across the board. Foreign nails have fallen instead. Due to the scarcity of foreign sandpaper and the increase in actual lockups, the situation of demand exceeding supply has finally led to an increase.</p>
<h3>Plain Velvet Fine Cloth Sells Well</h3>
<p>There are many types of velvet fine cloth, including mixed color, iridescent color, plain color, striped, and plaid. Mixed color, iridescent color, and plaid were popular more than ten years ago. Only striped and plain colors are currently circulating and being sold. Striped goods are scarce and expensive, while plain colors are more popular. Plain colors include black, blue, gray, yellow, and grass green. Gray and yellow are the most recently popular colors. American goods are the most popular and sell the fastest, with each yard being wholesale for 180,000-190,000 yuan. The rest are dominated by local factory goods. With the exception of the original color, which is less popular, black and blue sell more actively than grass green. The more famous brands are Yin Ji Fortune God Tiger, Hwa Lun Transportation Map, and Xiexin Five Blessings Coming to the Door.</p>
<h3>The Import and Export Control Commission Allows the Import of Plant Seeds</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Import and Export Control Commission recently approved the application from the Municipal Import and Export Industry Association and the Siyi Farm to import plant seeds. It was decided that the goods belonging to unlisted seeds in import tariff item 391 and live trees, flowers, and plants in item 657 will be changed from Annex 3B to Annex 3A and allowed to be imported.</p>
<p>White Melon Seeds are Expensive</p>
<p>White melon seeds have recently been transported from Sichuan. Just as black melon seeds are at their peak, the price is quite high. Yesterday, customers in the market were calling for 500,000 yuan, while merchants were offering 400,000 yuan, and no transaction was made.</p>
<h3>Internal Exchange Rate Gradually Stabilizes and Bank Remittances Decrease Significantly</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The exchange rate for remittances to Guangzhou by commercial banks and firms has weakened. It ranges from a low of 110 yuan to a high of 150 yuan per 1,000 yuan. This is a significant drop from the previous high of 200 yuan. The exchange rate for Hankou is relatively stable, ranging from 80 yuan to 100 yuan. In addition, with the internal exchange rate trending towards stability, remittances by commercial banks and firms through national banks and bureaus have also decreased significantly. For national banks, the total amount remitted yesterday was only 500 million yuan, while the past average daily amount exceeded 1 billion yuan. On the same day, the total amount of remittances received by national banks and bureaus was 270 million yuan, about half the amount remitted.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Clock and Watch Parts Allowed to Resume Import</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Import and Export Control Commission recently made slight changes to the import regulations for clocks and watches under tariff item 261. According to the original regulations, imports belonging to this tariff item were listed in Annex 3B as prohibited items. It is now stipulated that the entire clock and watch parts under this item, Category A, and the more needed imports such as alarm clocks, will be allowed to be changed to Annex 3A. Parts belonging to Category B, such as supplementary parts such as springs, will also be changed to Annex 3A and allowed to resume import.</p>
<h3>Chinese Naval Cadets Training in England</h3>
<p>— A Naval Dispatch from Plymouth on April 20th, by Wen</p>
<p>Our country's eastern and Pacific coastlines extend from the Yalu River estuary in Liaoning (53 degrees 50 minutes North latitude) in the northeast to the Beilun River estuary in Guangdong Province (10 degrees North latitude) in the southwest, spanning over 7,750 kilometers. In addition, there are isolated islands in the ocean, such as Hainan Island, Taiwan, and other smaller islands, which are not included. To protect this long coastline, a modern navy is indispensable. Building a new navy, within the overall national defense policy, cannot be achieved with just a piece of paper. In the victorious motherland, despite being in an extremely difficult environment, efforts are still being made in every way. In Gaochang Temple in Shanghai and Qingdao in the north, there are naval soldier schools and naval officer schools, where a group of heroic and aspiring young people are undergoing rigorous training – they are the backbone of the future new Chinese navy. They are diligently studying various subjects, preparing to serve the country and defend the motherland's coastline. Also, a group of outstanding young officers have been selected from this group and sent by the state to allied countries overseas to receive new knowledge and training, preparing to return to China to build a new navy. Here, I would like to introduce the activities of a group of Chinese naval cadets training in the British naval port of Plymouth.</p>
<p>Plymouth is the central base of the British Royal Navy. The winter climate there is such that it snows almost every day. The training location is on a large warship - the Renown, a giant ship with a displacement of 40,000 tons, and one of the largest warships in the British Navy. Speaking of its glorious achievements, it is very respectable; it participated in the First World War. The Renown is one of the three main battleships of the British Royal Navy, built in 1916. The other two ships were sunk by Axis aircraft in this war. This ship is considered lucky, having escaped disaster. In the past, when the British Emperor inspected the Navy, he always sat on this ship as the flagship. After the Pacific incident occurred, former US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill also held meetings on the Renown to discuss strategies, so it is quite famous and well-known throughout the world. The Renown has a displacement of 40,000 tons, which is the registered amount, but it is actually more than this. It has 110,000 horsepower, six 16-inch guns, six anti-aircraft guns, eight secondary guns, and two torpedo tubes. The construction cost reached more than 3 million gold pounds.</p>
<p>On the Renown</p>
<p>All the clothing issued in China was taken back and replaced with British-style uniforms. Each person received a coat, a raincoat, two sets of woolen uniforms, a set of work clothes, three pairs of leather shoes – two black and one white, three pairs of white western-style shorts, two pairs of long trousers, three pairs of woolen socks, five shirts, two large towels, two sets of thermal underwear, a wool sweater, two hats, and some other miscellaneous items. The value of these many items is estimated to be quite large. In the UK, the control of materials is unbelievable; without a coupon issued by the government, you will not be able to buy even a single hair, even if you have tens of thousands of dollars. This is the same for even a small handkerchief, and the prices are high and the quality is poor. You are allowed to eat the food, but not allowed to take it out. No wonder the British diplomats attending the foreign ministers' meeting in the Soviet Union ate so ravenously. Plymouth has been bombed by German aircraft and is still full of rubble, with traces of war visible everywhere. There has been no sign of recovery. The original tram tracks are now all abandoned and replaced by buses, and there is no crowding at all, unlike the traffic congestion in Shanghai. There is a Naffi for military personnel to rest, where everything is available, including food, clothing, supplies, and entertainment. Those who go there are all navy personnel, including navy personnel from various countries, and also female navy personnel. It can be seen how well they treat their military personnel.</p>
<p>As of February 1947, the basic training of the naval cadets training in England has been successfully completed. It is said that some of the cadets could not even recognize ABCD during training, and of course, they were even more confused in class, not understanding what the instructors were talking about at all.</p>
<p>Specialized Studies</p>
<p>Before being assigned to various specialized schools to study their favorite subjects, each of them chose their desired courses, listing their first, second, third, fourth... choices. The scope of their studies can be divided into:</p>
<p>(1) Engine Room Stoke</p>
<p>(2) Communication</p>
<p>1 Visual &amp; Signals</p>
<p>2 Wireless Telegraphy</p>
<p>(3) Seaman</p>
<p>1 Gunery;</p>
<p>a. Qualified ordnance</p>
<p>b. Quarters rating</p>
<p>c. Control rating</p>
<p>d. Anti aircraft</p>
<p>e. Layer rating</p>
<p>2 Asdic submarine detector</p>
<p>3 Torpedo Seaman to rpedo man</p>
<p>4 Rader</p>
<p>a. rade contro Calculation, measurement.</p>
<p>b. rad plotter Drawing</p>
<p>This group of naval cadets sent to England for training will receive specialized training to help us build a new navy. Batches of cadets will be sent to various specialized schools to study. They are in a foreign land, very concerned about the domestic situation after leaving their homeland, and are preparing to set foot on the land of their motherland, so they can work hard to serve the country and defend this ancient country with more than 5,000 years of history and a coastline of more than 7,000 kilometers.</p>
<h3>Eastern Jiangsu Storm</h3>
<p>— A Dispatch from Dongtai on May 3rd, by Our Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>Returning to Dongtai, drinking the heavy and salty boiled water, I felt a nameless sadness in my mouth and heart.</p>
<p>(Top) The "Aurora" (Renown, 7,000 tons displacement), a warship gifted by the United Kingdom to help China build a new navy, has been repainted and will soon set sail for China. (Bottom) The majestic appearance of the "Adventure" (Aruora, 45,000 tons displacement), a huge British ship on which Chinese naval cadets trained in England. (Sent by Wen)</p>
<p>The situation in Dongtai is unstable, and Communist troops often harass the highways. Before setting out, many people advised me not to go. But I finally made the trip with a bit of an adventurous spirit, because this is a place with which I have a not-so-shallow relationship.</p>
<p>I watched Dongtai recover. The troops advanced along the Tongyu Highway, and I followed step by step until I finally reached Dongtai city.</p>
<p>In the drizzling rain, I boarded a small steamer, the water gurgling. I said to myself, "I'll entrust myself to you for now!" The machine gun of the escort team was mounted on the bow, pointing directly ahead, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>Narrow Plank and Deep Moat: Like Crossing a Single-Plank Bridge</p>
<p>In a state of irritability and depression, I whiled away the six-hour voyage and arrived in Dongtai. After going ashore and undergoing inspection, I had to pass through a deep and wide trench to enter the city area. A wooden plank was laid over the trench, presumably with the same purpose as the drawbridge in front of the city gate in ancient times, which could be removed at any time. The plank was narrow and the moat was deep, and walking on it was frightening, truly like crossing a single-plank bridge. In addition, there were bunkers all over the streets, especially next to the Red Cross of the hospital and the gold sign of the bank. Having a structure for street fighting made the entire Dongtai shrouded in an atmosphere of tension.</p>
<p>The two days that the reporter was in Dongtai coincided with the news that the town of Caonian, 20 li from the city, had fallen and that the garrison was being rotated. At the same time, rumors spread that the Communist troops had been conscripting ancestral teams in Xiaohai in preparation for attacking the city. A group of well-informed people sent their families out of the city one after another, especially civil servants, truly in a state of panic. "Now I don't even dare to inquire about the news. If I really knew the actual situation, I wouldn't be able to get through the day!"</p>
<p>Ringing the Bell Tower Announces the Start of Martial Law</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, the situation in Dongtai cannot be said to be not serious. In a first-class county with an area of more than 570,000 square kilometers, the only areas currently under government control are the county seat and a highway connecting Tonghai and An and an official river connecting Tai County. County Magistrate Li Xiafu told reporters that he can now control a quarter of the area, which is probably somewhat of a politician's tone. The security in the urban area is of course guaranteed under the governance of the military and political authorities, but martial law is declared after 8 p.m., and earlier when the situation is tense. When martial law begins, it is announced by the sound of the bell on the bell tower. When the reporter heard it for the first time, the sound of the bell, trembling, drilled into my heart. Looking out the window, it was pitch black, and even some lights were dim and pitiful. The Tonghai-An highway can be used for traffic, but very "reluctantly". On the night the reporter arrived in Dongtai, the road surface and power lines between Fuan and Dongtai were destroyed by the Communist troops. As for the official river, this transportation line is relatively safe, but Nanzhuang, 20 or 30 li from the south bank of the official river, is where the Communist troops' Zishi County government is located. At this time when the Communist troops are roaming everywhere, who can say that they will not be threatened?</p>
<p>According to County Magistrate Li, the loss of Caonian was due to a group of bandits passing through the Tonghang Line from Xinghua and reaching the coast. They set a fire when passing through Caonian, and it was announced that it had been recovered the next day, but as of the reporter's departure from Dongtai, traffic between Dongtai and the city had not been quickly restored.</p>
<p>Land of Fish and Rice: Seafood, Cotton, and Salt Are Expensive</p>
<p>Dongtai is a land of fish and rice, traditionally famous for producing seafood, salt, and cotton. Now, because the coastal areas are completely in the hands of the Communist troops, large dried shrimp, two coins per catty, are no longer to be seen. Even if there are other seafood for sale, their prices have exceeded those in Shanghai. The production of cotton and salt is naturally even less to be said. The Caoan Salt Works Office is responsible for managing the coastal salt works from Juegang to Wuyou Road. It was first located in Tai County, and after Dongtai was recovered, it was moved to Dongtai. Up to this point, it can no longer continue to advance and expand the works. I have many old acquaintances in the office. Perhaps because of the rainy weather or the tense situation, when I went in, I only saw everyone chatting to relieve boredom, with nothing to do. Chief Tang said, "The current business is only collecting a little scattered salt tax. The office is not even as good as a tax collection office, let alone a salt works." At this point, the reporter stared at a map of Jiangsu Province hanging on the wall and took a deep breath at the 800-li-long coastal salt reclamation area.</p>
<p>When the reporter first arrived in Dongtai, I saw several boats in the river fully loaded with bags of cottonseed and wheat. I was still congratulating Dongtai on its prosperity, but who knew that these were originally snatched before Dazhongji fell. Dazhongji was originally a distribution center for cotton and a major source of tax revenue for the county government. Dongtai County's administrative expenses are 500 million yuan per month. The total county fiscal revenue in March was 300 million yuan, a difference of 200 million yuan, which was obviously stretched. However, after the fall of Dazhongji in April, the income was less than 100 million yuan. How to make up for such a large fiscal deficit is extremely difficult. According to Zhan Baohuang, the secretary-general of the county party headquarters, in addition to stepping up the implementation of the unified revenue and expenditure method, we can only consider collecting donations and taxes to remedy the situation. This is of course a temporary measure. If the security is stable, the financial problems will slowly return to normal.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Salt Works</p>
<p>Within the Controlled Area, We Have Done Everything We Can</p>
<p>Dongtai is now a pilot county in the pacification zone. In an extremely difficult state, we still have to do something to be a model for other places, which is another bitter thing. The reporter stayed for two days, taking a cursory look. The most impressive thing was the blue color on the street. The counters, doors, and light poles of the shops were all painted uniformly and had white slogans written on them. In addition, such as the repair of streets, public health institutions, and cooperatives, "Within the controlled area, everything that can be done has been done." This is what Zhang Naifan, the special commissioner of the Sixth District, told reporters in Zhenjiang. He also had a sentence: "We are thinking of expanding out!" He came to Zhenjiang to attend the provincial government's administrative meeting. As soon as he saw the reporter, he asked, "How is Dongtai?"</p>
<p>During the two days that the reporter was in Dongtai, there was a slanting wind and drizzle, which made me uncomfortable. On the day I left, the sky cleared up. After boarding the ship, the sun jumped out, and golden snakes danced on the water. The sky was clear, and my depressed mood was relieved. The reporter stood on the ship's side, waving to the friends who were seeing me off, and softly called out, "Dongtai, I wish you well in the storm!"</p>

<h3>On Modern French Painting: Pure Painting</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>In the modern French art scene, the rise of many astonishing painting theories leaves one feeling overwhelmed. There are artists like the Cubists with their triangular geometric shapes, the Dadaists with their musical symbol styles, and the Surrealists with their dreamlike and fanciful works, who have created various schools and achieved their illustrious careers. There are also artists like the Neoclassicists and the New Fauvists Mouvean Forvi m (a new painting movement that arose at the same time as Surrealism, but the Surrealist aspect is freer in terms of sensibility and expression), who did not form their own school but only shaped this trend. However, such views are merely the names used for the convenience of critics. In fact, each artist has their own artistic propositions and their own unique expressive personality. Therefore, it is quite difficult to incorporate them into the category of so-called schools or isms. Looking at the current French art scene, it can be said that the only recognized schools are Surrealism and Purism, or even Mechanism.</p>
<p>Many other painters can be said to have their own unique personalities, and under their own unique styles, they arbitrarily express the artistic spirit they believe in. Therefore, it cannot be considered very accurate to divide them into many schools for the convenience of critics' explanations. Moreover, this kind of classification is bound to have considerable differences because the views of critics may not be consistent. Therefore, if one must recognize a school, it is better to do as André Salmon said: "To summarize this group of painters into one category and include them all under the name of the 'School of Paris'." In other words, it can become a comprehensive field of the Paris art scene, encompassing both old artists, core artists, and general emerging young artists.</p>
<p>However, within this so-called School of Paris, there are artists who have lost their vitality and are stagnant, painters who are energetic and崭然露角（嶄然露角 means like, revealing corners that are already there. Hard to translate) , and nameless young people who are full of vigor and devote themselves to hard work. It is impossible to comment on these thousands of artists and their works. Therefore, the first thing we should focus on is what kind of painting issues are being revealed in the modern Paris art scene.</p>
<p>The reason why the modern Paris art scene has such a position is that it was inspired by the strong painting movement of Fauvism in the early 20th century, and then completed through the theories of Cubism, the baptism before the cruel war, and the outbreak of Dadaism. The painting isms or schools that arose in the meantime are too numerous to mention. However, these diverse isms or propositions on painting do not contain the nature of painting as a game, but are surprising efforts to discover the true essence of painting, exploration and investigation. To say it again, the rise and fall of these painting isms can be said to be "experiments" in the pursuit of the truth of painting. Every painting experiment, even if it becomes a finished painting, has brought valuable contributions as a result of many painting experiments and real research.</p>
<p>What is the achievement of painting? We can give the following answer. That is, "Painting must be purely painting." That sounds very ordinary. However, truth is never a strange product, and it often stands out from the ordinary. This is not to say that because it is the truth, it is ordinary, but that only with a sharp eye that wants to discover the truth from the ordinary will the truth shine brightly. Modern painting, after 30 to 40 years of continuous exploration, has finally discovered in the ordinary the truth that "painting has to be purely painting." The so-called painting that is purely painting, in other words, is to say that "painting should be pure painting," and the modern French art scene can be said to be progressing towards this pure painting.</p>
<p>We deduce the stylization of pure painting and study the theory of pure painting, then the expression of this painting lies in the so-called formation of painting.</p>
<p>If all the skills of painting and its expressive spirit can be fully painting-ized and fully purified, it becomes the "formation" of painting. All expressions of pure painting can be said to be obtaining the pictorial effect on the screen. Speaking of grasping the pictorial effect on the screen is about the phenomenon of painting formation. As a method of producing pure pictures, the so-called expression method is valued and studied. Therefore, the expression of so-called pure painting is not only the technique of finishing the picture, but is actually a method of obtaining the pictorial effect of the picture. In other words, it is a painting technique. If it fails to obtain any pictorial effect, it cannot be said to be an expression of pure painting.</p>
<p>When a painter sketches an object, it is not enough to describe the lines of that object and simply express the object as it is. Merely doing so, even if it is an illustration, cannot be regarded as painting. In order to make it possible to regard it as painting, whether it is a simple sketch or a simple depiction, the method of depiction must be absolutely "painterly." Also, if a certain theme is selected, even if that theme is depicted realistically and naturally, merely doing so cannot be regarded as pure painting. If these themes can be detached from the so-called concepts of resembling real objects and resembling nature, and are fully painting-ized and painting-purified, that is enough to become a problem of painting. It is also enough to be an expression made as painting. This is not a simple matter of abstraction. In order to make it fully painting-ized and fully painting-pure, the picture must be anticipated and used as a painterly object. Therefore, the expression of painting is nothing more than the process of painting-izing the theme on this painterly object surface.</p>
<p>The so-called painting-izing the theme on the painterly object surface, that is, the picture, does not simply rely on the basic elements of painting - color and line, but also requires that the theme anticipate the "painterly" reduction; and it must grasp its "painterly" composition. This phenomenon seems close to scientific analysis, but it is not. Instead, it is comprehensive and unified. It can be considered that it is a pictorial surface of painting formation composed of the elements of painting color, line, and composition.</p>
<p>The so-called selection of painterly themes can also be said to be one of the painterly formations. Just as we cut flowers and plants from the mountains and fields when planting potted flowers, the themes selected as painterly themes are obviously things that are cut off from nature. The so-called separating from nature is to transfer the order existing in nature to another different realm, and turn it into a painterly order Ordnung. In other words, the so-called painterly theme is to incorporate the order originally existing in nature into a new order of painting - a category - through the mind of the artist, so that it is purely painting-ized.</p>
<p>Secondly, is to describe the painterly theme on the picture, which goes without saying is a painterly formation. Whether its expression is superior or not depends entirely on the effect of this painting formation. Therefore, the so-called expression on painting is bearing the effect of painting, and what bears this effect and spirit of painting is expression. And only when this expression is finished is the so-called style studied. Therefore, the painting formation itself, without saying expression, and after being painterly tailored, is style. Because of the tailoring of that formation, the various styles on painting are studied.</p>
<h3>A Portrait of a Woman in the Prosperous Tang Dynasty (Dunhuang Murals)</h3>
<p>— Lin by Zhang Dawu</p>
<h3>Postscript to the Biography of the Stubborn Iron Taoist</h3>
<p>— Lao Mei</p>
<p>The Biography of the Stubborn Iron Taoist is Cai Beilun's self-description of his life's aspirations and encounters. Although the Taoist calls himself stubborn iron, I regard the Taoist as true gold and jade that is not thinned by grinding or blackened by immersion; and he has the purity of Boyi, the responsibility of Yiyin, and the harmony of Liu Xiahui, and his aspiration is to learn from Confucius. The Taoist is originally from Fujian. His grandfather served as an official in Taiwan during the late Qing Dynasty. The Taoist was born there, so he also calls himself a Taiwanese. In 1895, the Qing government was defeated and ceded Taiwan to Japan. The Taoist was still young, but he already had the ambition of Zhang Liang avenging Korea. At the age of twenty, he obeyed his parents' orders to study in Tokyo, Japan. After completing his studies, because his mother was still alive, he reluctantly accepted a bride, with the style of Liu Xiahui not being ashamed of serving a bad ruler or being humble about small officials. Later, after his mother died, he felt that the important event had been completed, so he could not bear to live in the place where the tyrannical government originated and where the tyrannical people lived. Therefore, he resigned from his post and bought a boat to return to his motherland, drifting to Shanghai, like Boyi who lived in the North Sea to avoid Zhou, waiting for the time.</p>
<p>When the Taoist first returned to China, he was delighted to see the establishment of the Republic of China and the restoration of the country. He fully intended to use what he had learned to serve the world, to make the people blessed by the benevolence of Yao and Shun, and to take on the responsibility of the world like Yiyin. However, at that time, he witnessed frequent internal troubles and was frustrated. He also painfully remembered that Taiwan was still under Japanese rule. Therefore, he lingered in his ancestral homeland, still living with his fellow villagers, unwilling to leave like Liu Xiahui, hiding in obscurity and living in poverty without complaint or sorrow. Recalling the Taoist's resignation from his Japanese official position and turning his head without looking back is like Confucius leaving Qi and traveling to Zhejiang; the so-called going quickly when one can go quickly.</p>
<p>Recently, when the national crisis first arose and Jiangnan fell to the enemy, the Japanese offered the Taoist a large sum of money to take on an important position. The Taoist repeatedly refused, unwilling to submit. Some criticized him for being stubborn, and others praised him as an iron man. The Taoist then called himself stubborn iron, not worried about being isolated from the world and not diminished by living in poverty; the so-called living where one can live. Fortunately, with the shock of the American atomic bomb and the Soviet Union's declaration of war, the violent Japanese surrendered, and China regained its glory. Taiwan, which had been lost for fifty years, returned to the embrace of the motherland. The Taoist's joy can be imagined! I believe that the Taoist should return to his hometown as soon as possible and participate in the politics of Taiwan. Why is he delaying his departure? Does he still have the feeling of Confucius leaving his parents' homeland?</p>
<p>I remember that when I first met the Taoist in 1917, I was surprised by his extraordinary ambition: he was pleased with his chivalry. When I met the Taoist again in 1928, I wrote a preface for him to record my feelings at that time. This time, after the calamity, we met again, and we both looked old, and our hair had turned gray. Seeing that his distant ambitions still existed and his lofty aspirations had not ceased, I hurriedly asked the reason for his delayed return. He then showed me a memorial text, and I knew that the Taoist had long had the ambition to return, but he was hindered by various circumstances and could not fulfill his wish. He had never forgotten the tombs of his ancestors for a single day.</p>
<p>Recently, the politics of Taiwan have been out of order, and civil unrest has suddenly arisen. Fortunately, the authorities have tried their best to deal with the aftermath, and the turmoil has been quelled. The Taiwanese people are eagerly hoping that the Taoist will return to Taiwan to serve his hometown. The Taoist is also eager to return. I said: This is the time for Confucius to serve when he can serve. The Taoist will use the golden and jade-like principles to develop his talents in Taiwan and express his long-held aspirations! Someone said: The Taoist's stubborn iron has become tempered steel. I don't know if it can be transformed into a flexible finger to cope with the changing situation? That is up to the Taoist to choose how to deal with himself. But I dare to assert that the Taoist will never change his chaste style. I only write this postscript to the biography to leave it to him.</p>
<h3>Reading Zhang Daqian's Recent Works</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>The early summer weather, due to the prolonged spring chill, still leaves people feeling a lack of warmth in their hearts. Yesterday afternoon, after the rain cleared, I had the opportunity to read some of Zhang Daqian's recent paintings. The pent-up discomfort in my heart seemed to be completely swept away.</p>
<p>Last winter, Daqian spent fifty gold bars to purchase Dong Beiyuan's "Evening Scenery on the Riverbank." The Song Dynasty artist's works are recorded in the "Xuanhe Painting Manual," which lists only seventy-eight paintings by Dong Yuan, and "Evening Scenery on the Riverbank" is one of his masterpieces. Daqian's purchase at the time caused a sensation in the art world, said to have broken the record for the purchase of paintings at a huge price. Daqian spent two months copying it exactly, and his skill is truly supernatural, leaving viewers astonished and unable to tell which is the original and which is the copy. Mi Xiangyang commented on Dong's paintings, saying: "Dong Yuan's style is plain and natural, unmatched in the Tang Dynasty, surpassing Bi Hong, and a divine masterpiece in recent times, with incomparable elegance. The peaks rise and fall, clouds and mist appear and disappear, without contrived artistry, all achieving naturalness; the misty colors are lush, the branches and trunks are strong and upright, full of life; the creek bridges and fishing villages, the isles and sandbanks, all evoke the Jiangnan region." It turns out that Chinese landscape painting, by the time of Beiyuan, approached the natural object, and shares the same goal with Western landscape painting, albeit by different paths. Small trees are often formed by dots, with dripping ink, a technique that Mi Jia derived from this. Daqian deeply understands the secrets of this, hence he considers this work one of his masterpieces.</p>
<p>"Tang Palace Musicians" is carefully designed in terms of color and composition, breaking away from the conventions of previous painters. The painting depicts a corner of the palace, similar to a close-up shot in photography. The depiction of the figures is even more unique. If one is not careful, at first glance, one only sees four or five people, but upon closer inspection, one realizes that there are eight people in the painting. Some only show half a face, some only show a skirt, and some only show a foot. This kind of composition is seen in Western paintings or art photography, but it seems to be a creation in Chinese figure painting. Another special feature is that the left and right sides of the painting are decorated with colorful patterns, which are transplanted from the Dunhuang murals. The brilliant and gorgeous colors further enhance the harmonious beauty of the entire painting. This kind of attempt marks the beginning of a new era in Chinese painting by Daqian, and is worthy of our deep study.</p>
<p>In the thirty-third year of the Republic [1944], the Ministry of Education held an exhibition of Daqian's copies of Dunhuang murals in Chongqing, which caused a sensation throughout the mountain city. After Japan's surrender, Daqian came to Shanghai, and new and old friends alike urged Daqian to move all of his Dunhuang paintings to Shanghai for a public exhibition, to add brilliance to the first international city in East Asia. However, due to transportation issues, it was difficult to transport them all at once. This time, Daqian brought several pieces for art lovers to study. Such as the Cao Yi, the military commissioner of the Guiyi Army in the 26th cave of Mogao Grottoes during the Five Dynasties, the portrait of Lady Jin, the Princess Guiguo Tian, ​​and the offering of Li Xi of Longxi, the portrait of a laywoman from the 151st cave of the High Tang Dynasty, the image of a nun in the same cave, the Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta from the 19th cave of the Yulin Grottoes, the story of Prince Sattva sacrificing himself to feed a tiger from the 245th cave of the Northern Wei Dynasty. Although there are only these six pieces, they represent a transformation, and the rest can be inferred from them. Tang Dynasty paintings are not easily seen today, let alone paintings from the Northern Wei Dynasty! Therefore, from this Northern Wei Dynasty painting of a tiger feeding, we can know the actual situation of the painting style at that time. The laywoman image of the High Tang Dynasty (see picture), is seven feet six inches high and four feet three inches wide. In the 47th year of the Republic of China (1918), on April 7th, the Taoist Wang Yuanlu discovered a hidden scripture chamber in this cave. A few years ago, when Daqian was traveling in Dunhuang, the Taoist told him about the discovery, which was a historical coincidence. The bag hanging on the branch in the painting is very similar to the popular new style of women's handbags, and the cane held by the person in the picture is the same as the commonly used cane today. The style of the hair curls remains fresh after a long time, which is very interesting to see. In addition, the copying and production of these murals are done by an all-around painter. His use of brushstrokes, ink, and color application naturally have his special skills, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Daqian returned to Chengdu for more than three weeks this time, and after returning to Shanghai, he gave us many new works to appreciate, which is an infinite feast for our eyes. After seeing it once, I wrote down what I gained, so that we know that in a country where prices are soaring and wars are not over, there is another corner that is still a society of truth, beauty, and goodness.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 505</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>No one answered outside the door, only a mysterious knocking continued, two taps, with an interval; six taps in total, still knocking so softly.</p>
<p>"Who?" He Jian heard no one responding outside, and this way of knocking was mysterious and contained a teasing meaning, as if a familiar friend was joking with him. However, in such a big city like Shanghai, He Jian knew that he didn't have such a familiar friend, so he felt strange and a little annoyed, so he raised his voice and asked, "Who?"</p>
<p>Tap tap, ... tap tap... tap tap... tap tap... This time, it tapped eight times in total.</p>
<p>The sound of knocking on the door increased by two each time. It was as if the person outside hadn't heard He Jian ask, "Who?" But as soon as He Jian asked, the knocking immediately started. If the visitor had heard, they should have answered at least once, right? Since they didn't answer, and kept knocking like this, what was going on?</p>
<p>At the same time, from the sound of knocking increasing by two each time, it can be inferred that if He Jian inside didn't change his approach and kept asking, then the knocking outside would inevitably increase by two each time. If it wasn't teasing, what was it? At least, in He Jian's frustrated mood, it was somewhat teasing to be bothered like this for no reason.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" He Jian was obviously getting stubborn.</p>
<p>The answer from outside the door was ten taps; with a pause every two taps; indicating that if the person inside didn't open the door, the tapping sound would continue to increase.</p>
<p>"When one is down on their luck, even ghosts mock you!" He Jian said, perhaps with this thought in mind. But after this tenth tap, He Jian suddenly realized that the visitor must be Shouyi. Xiang Zhengyan was his subordinate and wouldn't dare to joke like this; Li Ming had been serious and restrained ever since they met and wouldn't do this; as for that Korean youth representative, he was as shy as a maiden in her chamber and wouldn't do this kind of thing even more.</p>
<p>As for Shouyi, that was hard to say, because when he and He Jian met for the first time, they only talked a few words, and they became as close and familiar as old friends, and he had joked with him face to face. Only Shouyi, Zhengyan, Li Ming, and a few other people had come before and naturally didn't need to announce themselves. He Jian was sure that this person must be Shouyi. Thinking further, since Shouyi was playing around with He Jian in this anxious situation, it must be because he had good news; perhaps the comrades of Bain Ren Manor were playing the role of chivalrous people, deliberately appearing and disappearing mysteriously, showing this trick when none of the three parties expected it, and easily rescued Pingzi from the bandit's den and sent him to He Jian's place, giving him a big surprise.</p>
<p>These fantasies flashed through He Jian's mind like sparks from flint. This was also the reason for his unreasonable speculation, but a kind of wishful thinking. At that time, He Jian smiled dumbly, stopped asking, and strode to the door, pulling it wide open.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, are you Mr. Zhu Luo Mi?" The voice was so sweet and crisp, and full of resonance, as if it had been trained in vocal music for many years, speaking in a pure and authentic Beijing accent.</p>
<h3>Shame of Spiritual Food</h3>
<p>— Lei Ke</p>
<p>It was reported that a riot recently occurred in Chengdu, where thousands of poor people robbed rice merchants of rice, and all rice shops, candy shops, etc. on all streets closed their doors and suspended business, as if there was a strike. The only business that remained open as usual was the bookstore. Friends who saw this news believed that the bookstore industry (that is, the publishing industry) was worthy of pride. But upon closer reflection, it felt sad and ashamed. The poor do not rob bookstores, not because they have special respect for culture, but because they do not feel an urgent need for this spiritual food. They simply do not care about the existence of our spiritual food.</p>
<p>In cultural circles, when it comes to spiritual food, it seems to be more important than everything else, as if there is really something that can be eaten, and one will feel hungry if one doesn't eat it. Moreover, there are even more serious people who are extremely picky about these spiritual foods, wanting to distinguish which are beneficial and which are poisonous, fearing that they will harm those who eat it. Little do they know that only rice and wheat are regarded by the common people as the foundation of life, and as for the spiritual stuff, they only regard it as waste paper favored by a few literati and scholars, and in their eyes, it is only worth a few cents a pound for wrapping salt, sugar, or peanuts, and has no other value.</p>
<p>This is not because the common people are cold and ruthless, but because most of the people who create spiritual food are building carts behind closed doors and have not considered the needs of the public. They only create a very delicate snack, which only a few intellectuals have an appetite for. Furthermore, even the word "delicate" is questionable. Most of them are nominally delicate, but in reality, they are substandard substitutes that are not worth chewing, or inferior goods with luxurious decorations. Taking a step back, even if we now create truly exquisite and delicate snacks, or even popular food for the masses, the masses simply cannot eat these things, so how can they regard them as food? In short, there is still a literacy gap between spiritual food and the masses. Before the bridge is built, no matter how well the spiritual food is advertised, they are still unattainable and cannot be purchased or consumed.</p>
<p>Some people call this bridge a literacy movement. However, simply being literate may not be enough to cross it. The words learned in three to five months using the crash course method can be completely forgotten in the same amount of time. Only by paving the bridge of literacy with spiritual food can the masses be able and eager to cross the bridge. This task is easier said than done. If culture and education do not work closely together, this matter will be difficult to achieve.</p>

<h3>Puppet Poetry Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhang Fu</p>
<p>"Having just visited Lady Yu's to pay respects to one's godmother, now one is paying respects to Godfather Liang, the new Minister of the Household, a lively entrance, a desolate courtyard in the main hall; if the father has intentions, he should pity the concubine, how can the servant have no face for the sake of her husband, a hundred and eight prayer beads express deep affection, a few gusts of wind carry the fragrance of milk."</p>
<p>This is a poem mocking Hanlin Wang during the Qianlong period, Wang was unethical and flattering. His wife first worshipped the concubine of the Jin Tan Xiangguo Yu as her mother, and then Xiangguo lost power, so she went to Tangquan to worship Liang Jieping Shangshu as her adoptive father. The behavior was very intimate. In the cold winter months, Liang went to court early. Wang's wife would always take the court beads first, warm them on her chest, and personally hang them up for him. When Lei first arrived, he presented coral beads from his bosom with both hands to Liang on the day of his yellow greeting. Liang blushed greatly and ran away. Wang's wife chased the beads to the place of concern and circled them around his neck. The guests were full, all were greatly surprised. The next day, someone wrote this poem on Wang's door. An old novel named "The Puppet's Record" describes this matter.</p>
<p>Wang's relationship with others was so strong that he did not hesitate to flatter others at the risk of his life. It was something that even maids and prostitutes would disdain to do, which was truly shameless. Looking at his worshiping of a godmother and then a godfather, being opportunistic, ungrateful, then his flesh is not worth eating. However, the coldness and warmth of human relationships are the same in ancient and modern times. Furthermore, those puppet figures disregard shame, do not know morality, use profit as a union, and use gold for friendship. When the profit is gone, the gold is exhausted, and they are like strangers, who will care for each other? I heard that when the traitors put on their clothes and hats and became monkeys, adopted sons surrounded the pavilion and peaches and plums filled the door, rushing to the front of the steps, taking a close look as the greatest honor. Now that these traitors are shackled and chained, they have been imprisoned one after another. The door is deserted, and everyone has fled, and no one is left to care for their families.</p>
<p>Chanting the two lines "The thread comes from Yu's house to worship the godmother, now worshiping Godfather Liang," and sighing that the puppet's mantle is passed down in one continuous line, it seems that it is not surprising.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Are Laughing</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yin</p>
<p>The Tianjin and Beijing reporters who went to visit Tanggu New Port were blocked by our allies with bayonets and suffered a not-so-small insult.</p>
<p>So, the Japanese on a ship flying the "Sun Flag" laughed loudly. Looking at the reporters' statement afterwards, I seemed to hear the enemies' cackling, owl-like laughter, and I seemed to see the hideous ghost face hidden behind the smile.</p>
<p>Originally, our country, one of the "Four Powers" or "Five Powers," has been insulted more than once, so there is no need to be surprised; it seems that it can be ignored that people from defeated countries sneer at us. In fact, haven't they already created a bigger Nonggu incident for us to see?</p>
<p>However, I thought of what was said in a certain newsletter: Most Japanese firmly believe that failure is temporary and that they will rise again soon; I thought even more of their farewell message of "We'll be back in twenty years." Their ambition to invade has not been completely eliminated, and we should not "laugh it off" at their laughter.</p>
<p>Listen, the Japanese are laughing!</p>
<p>I can't help but ask: Will they laugh even harder when they see that we are still in a state of chaos and turmoil everywhere?</p>

<h3>A Scene of "Returning Home in Glory"</h3>
<h3>News Web</h3>
<p>— Tie Yun</p>
<p>There is no problem with unfreezing the cost of living index, but we hope that when the cost of living index is unfrozen, prices will not continue to rise. Otherwise, to whom will civil servants, workers, etc. appeal?</p>
<p>The chaotic traffic situation in Shanghai is rare in any country. Dr. Conway, an American traffic expert, also shook his head when he came to Shanghai. In fact, there are only two points to rectify traffic: (1) scientific management (2) increase traffic routes (aerial or underground). For the first point, if you visit the cars in Hongkou, you can know the achievements of our management; for the second point, the construction of new lanes requires a lot of money, and the city government is so poor, how can it start construction?</p>
<p>Originally, not many Chinese people read newspapers, but now newsprint prices are soaring. The evening paper has already risen to 1,000 yuan per copy. It is said that the daily newspaper will rise to 1,500 yuan per copy from the 16th. Then, there are probably not many people who can afford 40,000 to 50,000 yuan a month to read a newspaper. Under the high pressure of prices, the future of the Chinese press will also be bleak.</p>
<p>The production cost of a film is at least tens of millions of yuan. Various film companies are trying their best to improve the quality of films and no longer produce them crudely. It is hoped that the government will restrict the distribution and stop the screening of crudely made films.</p>
<p>Minister Yu said that the total number of legal tender issued is only more than 6 trillion yuan. This is the first time the Ministry of Finance has publicly announced the amount of legal tender.</p>
<h3>Freezing and Thawing</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>In natural phenomena, freezing and thawing are based on a law of physical necessity. Taking ordinary water as an example, when the temperature reaches zero degrees Celsius, it will definitely condense into a solid, and when it reaches above zero degrees, the water will return to a liquid state. If no artificial action is added in the middle, freezing and thawing will develop along with the natural temperature.</p>
<p>Natural phenomena are scientific and definite. Have you ever seen water not freeze at the freezing point? Or have you ever seen a frozen riverbed in the scorching heat of June? Therefore, in terms of social phenomena, when white rice rises to the 300,000 mark, the cost of living index for workers is still frozen at the stage when white rice was 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per stone three months ago. How can this be reasonable? How can our social order be stabilized?</p>
<p>Recently, it is said that the cost of living index is about to be unfrozen, which is inevitable and should be. However, to unfreeze it, we must also create a dissolving temperature. We know that scientists must start by changing the temperature of the substance to solidify or dissolve it, so that it naturally changes. The freezing and thawing itself completely depends on the environment in which it is carried out. Failure to understand this physics will result in an explosion.</p>
<p>The development of human civilization originated in the temperate zone, because that kind of warm climate is most suitable for people's work. Of course, there are also animals and plants in the Arctic Circle, but that region still does not have a high level of human culture. If life is frozen in an ice cellar, society will not progress. This kind of natural experience is what the gentlemen who stabilize our society should remember. We can only adjust the temperature of society so that thawing and freezing become extremely natural states, so that people can have a truly peaceful life.</p>
<p>Summer has begun, and not only must the freezing of the earth inevitably require thawing, but we also hope to usher in a prosperous day. Only in that vibrant season can the problem of freezing and thawing be truly resolved.</p>
<h3>The Fattening Technique</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Woman A: Look at how skinny I am, what are the secrets to getting fat?</p>
<p>Woman B: You just need to eat more "longevity fruit" and you'll get it.</p>
<p>Woman A: Really?</p>
<p>Woman B: Didn't you see the giant elephant in the park?</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Circles</h3>
<p>The famous novelist Steinbeck's "The Moon is Down" has been translated by Zhao Jia into the Chenguang Literature Series and will be published in mid-May. It is heard that the film adapted from the book will be shown at the Grand Light Theater in this city. The second translated work in this series is Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov," translated by Geng Jizhi.</p>
<p>Qian Zhongshu's first full-length novel, "Siege," has been released by Chenguang Publishing Company. This novel, which is more than 200,000 words long, was serialized in Renaissance and is a brilliant masterpiece on the new literary scene after victory.</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian is a famous playwright in China. Next year will be Ouyang's 60th birthday. He has recently responded to the invitation of Chenguang Publishing Company and is writing an autobiography of about 400,000 words. It starts from the Spring Willow Society era in 1924 and continues until his recent departure from Guangxi. It will be published in two volumes, the first of which is being printed and will be published by the end of June.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>More than thirty people got on the bus very stably. They also knew that there were too many people taking the bus and did not want to seek comfort. Everyone tried their best to squeeze in, and the luggage only occupied half a car; only Lan and Feifei were persuaded by Zhang Changlu and those people in front to sit on the driver's seat.</p>
<p>"Miss Zhou, Miss Zhu, we'll switch with you later!" Lan still felt very sorry and repeatedly said to the two actresses that everyone should take turns sitting.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, you may not be able to sit stably!" Lao Zhu said with a smile. He knew very well how noble the driver's seat of a truck was in people's minds.</p>
<p>Lan smiled faintly, and she obviously didn't care about this.</p>
<p>Feifei was too excited, climbing on the front of the car for a while, then climbing down again, then playing with the steering wheel used by the driver; Zhang Chang accompanied her like an older brother, playing up and down, front and back, as happy as students going out for a trip during the spring break.</p>
<p>Those who didn't get on the bus yesterday gradually came to look for them. The quiet wilderness immediately became noisy, like a day of rushing construction.</p>
<p>The five military trucks were quickly filled with people. At nearly eight o'clock, a large group of people wearing khaki uniforms arrived, and the noise became even more chaotic. Those drivers simply opened their mouths to curse and started fighting, and all the people on the bus without tickets were driven away; but after a while, another group of "scalpers" who didn't have tickets but had obtained their tacit permission came in succession, and the number was even larger than the former. Everyone on the bus was worried about how to endure the long journey of two days and nights on such an uneasy truck. (6/7)</p>
