<h3>商計對日和約問題　我已向美表明立塲　對表決方式提具體意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日電〕美國務院發言人今宣稱：中國對美國所提「召開分步商討對日和約會議」之建議，巳作答覆，但該發言人對此一覆文係何時送達，則未加說明。渠稱：中國外長王世杰，曾與美駐華大使司徒雷登商討此事，同時，中國駐美大使顧維鈞亦曾與美國務院官員對此事加以研究。各記者旋詢渠中國覆文之詳細內容如何？渠答稱：中國之態度，乃衆所週知，故染對此拒加　釋。渠繼稱；所不幸者，各記者及渠本人腦海中俱有「中國對於對日和約問題將作正式覆文」之意見，渠稱：國務院不預期自中國接獲正式答覆或較所接獲者爲正式之答覆。有詢以中國之答覆何故爲非正式者？據答稱：渠認爲國務院從未提出正式提案，美國之召開會議建議，於通知中國駐美大使時，係與後者在國務院中非正式談及，一如美管理佔領區事務之助理國務卿希特倫與他國談及召開此項會議之可能性者然。該發言人並宣布，已收到全部十個被邀國家之答覆。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日合衆電〕美國官員稱：中國政府於其對美國听提關於對日和約表決程序之建議所提之「非正式」之抗議，曾援用美國前於十一國遠東委員會成立時所提之論斷，當時美國曾謀使遠東委會之決議，應經十一國中三分之二多數之通過，惟並附帶規定稱：此議案並應再經東京盟國對日管制委會四强多數之同意，此即謂中，美，英，蘇四强中之三强，對於任何決議表示同意後，決議案始可獲最後通過。美國原欲以此爲取銷單一强國否決權之方法，然美國及其他國家，終將蘇聯堅持强國中任一國家之簡單否決，即可取銷任何決議案一論有予以讓步。美國於建議對日和會表決程序時曾稱：議案僅需經十一國之三分之二數通過，即可成爲定案，而大國與小國在投票表決方面，並無任何差異，然中國對表決方式所提之意見，僅屬於「非正式」者。中國駐美大使館尙未將此項意見提向美國務院，而使其成爲官方之意見。若干人士成稱：中國方面欲以此探詢詢美國人士對此問題之意見。</p>
<h3>桂永清氏播講　我國海軍現狀</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕海軍代總司令桂、水淸將軍，一日下午七時在國防部軍一播音總隊，向全國廣播，題爲「中國海軍現狀」。桂氏首指出海軍爲國防體系中之一環，次乃舉出此次世界大戰期中太平洋海戰經過，證明如不能建設强大的中國海軍，即無法確保太平洋之永久和平。桂氏謂：「吾人固深盼新海軍之成長，而盟邦爲維護世界和平計，亦以極可珍貴之熱情，協助我新海軍之建設，內外形勢同此要求，此實我國設海軍之絕好機會」。</p>
<p>關於目前的海軍現况與設施狀態，桂氏作一綜合報吿稱：（一）海軍政令經嚴加整飭後，現在南自海南島及南沙島，北迄胡蘆島，不論對海軍任何機構，海軍政令是絕對統一而貫澈的。（二）海軍員額本年春李，因奉令緊縮整軍，全軍以三萬二千人爲限，現因艦艇增多又已奉命擴充爲三萬四千五百人。（三）海軍艦隊實力，經重新編組後，現共有海防第一，第二兩艦隊，江防艦隊與運輸艦隊有四個艦隊，另有十個砲艇隊，均分駐江海防各基地，担負綏靖任務。（四）海軍基地的設置，已於滬靑，左營及楡林港四處設置基地司令部，另就各基地司令部軍區及長江江防區內成立巡防處十一處，計葫蘆島·大沽·定海·基隆·馬公·厦門·黃埔·海口·南京·湖口·溪口等。（五）軍需獨立，財物公開及補給制度的建立。海軍總部第四署人員全由國防部派遣各級軍需人員及艦隊軍需，由總司令部第四署派遣，財政經濟完全公開，因海軍所有業務，皆在使艦隊可以活動自由，故在主基地內成立補總站五處，另有各巡防處戰術基地內，分別成立補給分站，係集中統籌分別補給。（六）艦艇修能造力的整理與擴充。海軍建軍以造艦力及輕重工業的發展爲其主要基礎，現滬靑·左營·楡林·馬公·黃浦·大沽各處，各有海軍造船所，於各巡防處所在，均設有海軍工廠，對於海軍現有各艦艇，均可負修裝的責任。（七）統一海軍訓練。現在海軍軍官訓練集中於靑島海軍軍官學校，士兵訓練，則集中於海軍軍士學校。此外，造船·造機·造械·電工各項專科訓練，則集中於海軍機械學校。至於招生辦法，則按照各省人口比例，採取分省定額制錄取，免重蹈系派或學系系派的覆轍。</p>
<p>桂氏服曾提及海軍通訊網之改進，人事制度之設立，法規之編纂，綏靖工作之檢討，日艦美艦之接收。在結論中，桂氏特別指出海軍建設，首先遭遇之問題，爲技術人員與幹部的培養。現在海軍總司令部，已下令召集全國海軍人員回軍服役，並自本年起，中央海軍學校在全國各省市普遍招生，其次海軍建設，需要高度化的工業及精湛的科學知識，不能一蹴即成。桂氏又指出中國海疆約一萬公里，北起鴨綠江江口，南至廣東之北崙河口，綿延七省領海，南到南沙，西沙等島，東到澎湖，台灣等島，沿海大小島嶼約三千四百餘個，面積約四萬餘方公里，半部海岸，完全裸露於海洋，如缺乏强固的海防，中國即將遭受威脅。</p>
<h3>美孚公司要員　梅特呼籲援華</h3>
<p>〔聯合社洛杉磯一日電〕美孚油公司中國分行要員梅特今日在遠東問題會議中演說，以爲在金融與技術上援助中國商業復蘇，乃東方之迫切需要。據稱：中國工商業倘能恢復自由，該國即可安定。中國取得日本在遠東喪失之領導地位，實與整個世界有利。中國有資源與智力以求自力更生，但此刻需要援助。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　對日和約的幾個經濟問題</h3>
<p>— 丁志進</p>
<p>戰爭結束了兩年而和約猶未簽訂，這是有史以來歷次國際戰爭所未有的現象；但是大多數的國家，並不是不想早日簽訂和約的，尤其是美國，盼望早日締結和約，最爲迫切；因爲至和約簽訂以後，不僅駐在戰敗國的軍隊就可以撤退；而且與戰敗國的貿易也可以恢復了，足以减輕納稅人的負祖。最近美國發出通知，邀請遠東十一國在八月十九日舉行對日和約初步會議；就是基於這種動機。</p>
<p>對日和約的最高目的，乃在要使日本永不能再起侵略。要達到這一個目的，當然要從軍事·政治·經濟·文化與教育等各方面努力；但人類的文明發展到現階段，我們認爲經濟無寗是最根本最現實的一方面。五十年前，日本的學校裏教師在問：「那裏產的桃子最好吃？」學生們在答：「中國的桃子最好吃！」日本之處心積慮發動對華侵略，最根本的動機，就是要攫取中國的豐富資源。戰爭的技術與規模發展到今天，無疑的經濟已成了決定因素。日本之所以能掀起對華侵略戰爭，完全靠她的工業優勢；而聯合國這所以能獲得最後勝利，無可否認的也是得力於美國生產力的龐大；今後的戰爭完全是「生產的戰爭」，是「經濟力量的戰爭」。所以在對日和約中，關於經濟部份，是各國所必爭，尤其是我國，決不容許有一絲疏忽。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們提出幾側原則來撿討一下：</p>
<p>第一，要使日本的工業永不能　　戰時工業工業。界上只有蘇聯的幾次五年計劃，將大部份人民的血汗，建立龐大的軍用工業；其他的國家，在平時却很少以全力來生產軍火的；此在日本，於和約初訂之際，也是不會大胆的以全力生產軍火。但日本人民是一個能含垢忍辱，有陰謀策略的民族，他會利用種種口實，建立擴充許多種工業，一旦有事，立可改置爲軍火工業，而在今日美蘇衝突日趨尖銳化的環境下，美國也許會縱容日本，但在中國看來，這無異葬送了八年抗戰的成果，對於中國，實在太危險了。我們務須在和約中積極地阻止此一方向的發展，使日本的工業在未來任何時候，都不許可其轉變爲戰時工業。</p>
<p>第二，要使日本的經濟不可能轉為戰時經濟。一個國家平時有平時經濟的體系，戰時有戰時經濟的體制。戰時經濟體制的最緊要一點，在於自給自足。糧食要自給自足，軍火工業以及必要的民生工業自原料，勞工以至機器都要自給自足。最上者在平時建立一個工農業的規模，可以隨時停止輸入，而自己的生產足數戰時各方面的需求。其次是在平時大量積貯，以備戰時應用。這兩種方式中，無論那一種，都不許戰敗的日本加以運用的。</p>
<p>第三，要使日本未來的經濟發展，不致與我國的經濟發展衝突，一個戰敗國簽訂了和約，就要重新立國了；我們因不能希望日本的經濟，永遠停留在現階段；而且在事實上，日本的經濟已在麥帥的扶掖下，逐漸復蘇；所以我們必須使其發展，不與我國的發展衝突。中日兩國同處東亞，同處溫帶，物產有許多相同，譬如說中國產絲，日本也產絲。中日兩國同屬工業後進國家，工業發展的階段相差不多，工業的重點也有許多相同，譬如說中國工業發展眼前較有成績的是紡織業，日本的外銷物品，也以紡織的爲主。我們應在和約中對此應加以限制，使她不可能作不利於我們的競爭。</p>
<p>根據這三個原則，我們可以舉出幾個實際問題來討論：</p>
<p>（一）賠償問題　關於日本的賠償，我們聽見過鮑萊計劃，美國國務院的計劃，麥帥計劃等等。我們所得的印象是一個比一個寬容，賠償的數量，一個比一個减少。而根據中央社七月廿六日的電訊，美國且將提議各國，放棄賠償要求了；這對於慘遭日軍蹂躪的中國，無異乎是一種威脅。第一，我們需要工廠機器，要她們來生產戰時給日軍摧毁的物資，補償八年中中國工業發展所受戰爭的阻抑與摧殘，復興戰後的工業與經濟。第二，我們應指定一批完整而為我國所需的工廠，規定日期拆遷。其次，我們應指定幾種我國所需的日本工業產品，如紗布·肥料·人造絲等，規定數量，令其分期賠償，每年交付。第三，我們也應要求現金賠款。日本在戰時摧毁了我們無數財產房屋，這些中國國民的眞實資本應由日本的工廠與產品來賠償；但是日本的侵略也造成了我國的通貨膨脹，至今有加無已，這也是要日本負責的，我們有權要求一筆龐大的現金賠款，來穩定我們的通貨。</p>
<p>（二）工業水準問題。美國擬將日本的工業保留或恢復至一九三〇至一九三四年的生產水準，這是非常可怕的。所以我們認爲：第一，我們所採的標準應該是生活水準而非生產水準。我們知道自一九三一至一九三七年，日本的生產指數增加了三倍，而人民的消費指數只增加了百分之四十。這原因是當時日本的生產，大部份是儲藏起來備充戰爭之用，一部份則成了財閥的利潤與資產。所以生產水準的提高對於日本一般人民並不一定有好處。我們應當替戰後日本人民規定一個生活水準，而後視其需要，決定保留工業的數量。第二，我們所採取的生活水準不當是戰前日本人的生活水準，而應是戰後亞洲人民的最低生活水準。在富有中生長起來的美國人看來，日本人的生活水準固已很低，但在中國人印度人的眼中，日本人的生活已可說舒服之至；而日本人的生活所以能較亞洲其他各國為優，顯然是好過去一百年來向外侵略掠奪鄰國土地資源以及經濟上剝削鄰國的結果，今天亞洲各被侵略國聯合起來，藉其他聯合國家之助，打倒了日本的侵略主義，却仍要讓她保留侵略的成果，才冤枉！日本今天是在喊「飢餓出口」，成千成萬的中國人却眞的在啃樹皮草根。所以我們應先比較亞洲各國人民的生活水準，確定其最低者，然後按照這一個水準所需，決定保留日本工業的數量</p>
<p>（三）國際貿易問題　日本是一個不能自給自足的國家，而爲了保證其平時經濟不可能轉爲戰時經濟起見，我們前面說過正要使她如此。那末爲了滿足日本人民平時的正當需要，日本的對外貿易自然是應當開放的。但是在和約中，我們對此也應加以幾點限制：第一，進口物品的種類，必須限於確實爲民生所需者。儘管我們對於日本國內的軍火工業予以拆除，如果對她的進口貿易不加監督，她仍可自外國輸入軍用原料，以備他日之用。所以對她進口物品的種類必須加以嚴格的限制。第二，各種進口物品的數量每年不得超過該類物品的眞實消費量減去國內生產量之差額。有許多物品在平時可以作為民生必需品的，至戰時却成了道地的軍用品的，我們不能讓日本假維持民生之美名而暗地貯藏起來。就是不可能轉充軍用的眞正民生必需品，也不應讓日本藉進。超過實際消費差額而存儲起來，因為如果日本再要發動戰爭，民生必需品與軍火是何樣重要的。第三，日本對華輸出的物品種類與數　，中國政府應有權隨時加以干涉。在今天我國實行亞格的外匯與貿晚管制下，日貨的傾銷固不足慮，但這一種管制是遲早要撤銷的，我們回憶日貨傾銷的歷史，以及當時抵制日本經濟侵略的辛酸，深感這樣的規定在和約中，也是不可缺少的。</p>

<h3>安理會採取嚴峻行動　促印荷立即停戰　荷總理仍希望美國斡旋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二日廣播：合衆社歐洲經理爲明瞭荷蘭在荷印爭端中之立塲起見，曾以書面問題送呈荷蘭總理貝爾，業經貝氏答復。問：在調解未實現前，荷蘭需要何種先決條件及保證？答：深信美國之斡旋，將促使問題之解決。問：閣下以爲戰事能平日結束乎？答：深信荷蘭所欲達到之目標，不久即可達到。問：據稱荷軍在各地大施破壞確否？答：不確。相反的，印尼則已實行焦土政策，華僑損失尤大。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖二日電〕聯合國安理會昨夜議決促使印荷立即停戰並用公斷成其他和平方法解決糾紛後，數小時內即向荷印兩國政府發出照會，是爲聯合國機構成立以來之最嚴峻行動。爲執行決議案起見，依照聯合國憲章，安理會最後一着得乞助於經濟制裁，且由五十五個會員國全體與之斷絕外交關係。必要時並得採取陸海空軍行動，以維持或恢復國際和平與安全。荷蘭駐美大使克里芬斯會後雖向記者表示無意見，但荷印雙方料將遵守安理會訓令辦理。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖一日電〕安理會討論印尼問題僅兩日，即於今夜決定荷蘭與印尼雙方應立即停戰，用公斷或其他方式息爭。此種空前決議，要為聯合國機構成立以來第一次直接制止戰爭之行動。表決票數爲八票對零票，英法比三國棄權。英國稱棄權非行使否決權，法代表巴洛迪稱寗願投反對票，但反對票即為行使否決權，恐將此案打消，故改為棄權。表決後主席即敘利亞代表戈里即命秘書處以此項決議通知荷蘭與印尼兩國政府。安理會旋宣吿休會至下星期一。今日討論五小時，蘇代表曾主張雙方軍隊撤回原防，作爲調解先決條伴，卒被否決。美國提案經法國修正通過，使安理會承認印尼共和國。荷代表對此爭辯甚烈，謂印尼尙未成爲獨立國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖一日電〕安理會今日討論印荷問題，英代表建議在美國企國促使印荷交戰雙方和解之前，應暫擱置此一問題，美蘇二國代表皆表反對。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯並譴責美國之調解動譏稱：荷蘭現顯欲控制當前之局勢，持續至荷軍獲得勝利時爲止，故余對安理會等候美國調解結果後，再行加以討論一議，表示反對。荷蘭今接受調解之態度，顯在延宕時日，以便對印尼居於「有利地位」而已。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京二日電〕外交部發言人不能證實此間外交界所傳中國支持印澳就印尼問題在安理會所取行動之說。政府另一方面則謂前項傳說爲有趣的揣測，惟中國外交部已決定在指示其駐安理會代表以前，略事繼續靜待事態之發展。</p>
<p>〔聯合社海矛二日電〕荷蘭內閣今日舉行特別會議，討論聯合國安理會要求荷印雙方停戰一事。</p>
<h3>荷軍續有進展　日惹宣布戒嚴</h3>
<p>〔台衆社巴達維亞二日電〕荷蘭二日公報稱：荷軍業巳佔領爪哇中部在大火焚燒中之波權華爾多城。該公報又宣佈，印尼軍在爪哇各地潛入荷軍陣地。關一日於聯合國理事會之行動，即決定戰爭應停止，該公報中隻字未提。荷軍統帥顯然對於聯合國之決定，尙無暇考慮及此。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞二日電〕據荷軍公報稱：荷軍業已佔領蘇門答臘首都棉蘭南五十哩之卡奔介，由於印尼焦土政策之結果，該城在大火中。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞二日電〕印尼電台稱：共和國首都日惹，業已宣布戒嚴，共和國政府，已任陸軍參謀長鄔利浦中將爲日惹軍事長官，以將領十人爲輔，負責城防。荷方公報宣布，爪哇南岸芝拉札港之油池，被共和國軍縱火，正焚燒中。共和國軍在爪哇中部普遍實行焦土戰略，糖廠，香烟廠，及椰子工廠，悉被縱火焚燬。</p>
<h3>美報評論荷印爭端</h3>
<p>謂已造成亞洲大國結</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山一日電〕舊金山紀事報今日以「亞洲殖民主義死去」爲題發表評論稱，印度代印尼向安理會申訴，中國亦爲印尼聲援，由此種種觀之，日本雖已一敗塗地，但其掀起戰禍之結果，似已贏得亞洲團結反對西方控制之運勁。亞洲天際朕兆顯露：「數百年來離間統治之局勢已經過去，亞洲民族如能團結一致反對殖民主義，則必無一國或數國結合能使之死灰復燃，此爲世人有目所應共覩者。」亞洲在技術及軍事方面固仍落後，西方任何一國之一兵一卒固有殺死一百個亞洲人之力，但數萬萬亞洲人游擊破壞報復，對於殖民國家之資源與神經，最後必有使之不支而潰之一日。西方國家如能認識此種不可避免之事實，匪特其本國之利，亦人類之福。</p>
<h3>美調處印荷事件　國務院意見歧</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕國務院遠東司若干官員頃談稱：彼等憂慮美國以調解人地位或其他方式而調解印尼事件之舉，或將影響美國在整個東南亞之友人及其善意，蓋國務院內親荷反印之官員似已能操縱美國對於印尼事件之行動。按國務院內之「專家」等對印呢事件裂成兩派意見，處理歐洲方面事務者全力袒護荷蘭，而負責亞洲及太平洋事務者認爲印尼之理由充足。此事在華盛頓已爲公開之秘密。</p>
<h3>吧城僑領黃恩世　請切實保護僑胞</h3>
<p>難僑三百人脫險抵棉蘭</p>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞一日電〕此間華僑領袖黃恩世（黃鎭球之弟），今電呈蔣主席及其他部長，請求採取具體步驟，保護爪哇與蘇門答臘之僑胞，並表示撥款救濟方法恐不足爲保障僑胞生命財產有效之策。該電稱，爪哇與蘇門答臘之華僑，目前所受印尼軍隊之縱火殺人與強刦之苦難，較之坦其隆大屠殺尤廣泛而深劇，若我政府無具體之保障辦法，則兩地華僑八十萬人，將遭遇更可怖與不可想像之危險。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕外交界息：棉蘭附近十二哩處之日里大鎭遭印尼軍隊圍困之難僑，已有三百餘人搶救脫險，抵達棉蘭，我駐該地領館巳予收容救濟。又距棉蘭四十哩之網眼　口，難僑甚衆，我領館刻在設法馳救中。該領館又派員赴亞冷名額設　救濟分會，負實辦理救濟該處因受戰禍波及而無家可歸之千餘僑胞。</p>

<h3>法總理賴瑪迪　述越南局勢</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎一日電〕賴瑪迪總理在每週記者招待會中稱，法軍在越南從事軍事活動後，業巳解放大部份區域及各重要城市，今後祗須殲滅內地山林中之殘餘抵抗，故法軍必須了解越軍之戰術，並採取游擊戰略。越南今巳再度成爲法國之資產，大部份區城內之法律與秩序均巳恢復云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯企圖攫取全世界　美必須加以阻止　衆院外委會主席伊登提出警吿</h3>
<p>〔聯合社級約二日電〕衆院外交委員會主席伊登今日宣稱，蘇聯現已「明白表示有意攫取歐洲，然後攫取全世界」，美國必須警吿蘇聯停止此種征服世界計劃，否則可能引起戰爭。吾人目前毋庸乞助於武力，憑藉各大國及追求美國民主理想各小國之領袖地位，即可使蘇聯不敢越雷池一步。蘇聯若不屈服且學習文明國家之行爲，則吾人應將蘇聯自聯合國機構中開除，而單獨進行工作。目前不加制止，必有一日勢將被迫利用武力，屆時蘇聯軍險在人員與兵器方面容或優於吾人，此舉殊屬艱巨。但吾人有原子彈，余深信蘇聯至少現尙無之。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林一日電〕據悉：美陸軍官員稱，德境美佔區內發現二家工廠未經美軍政府之許可，爲某外國製造戰爭物資，美官員發現大批匿藏物資，以避免檢查，其中包括已有一半完成之飛機，坦克車及潛水艇用之回轉機，飛機翼子及身體之零件，供觀察火箭飛行用之活動經緯儀器，以及潛水艇用之潛望鏡等。據官方發表稱：陸軍部，經濟部，以及信號隊官員在視察美軍區內曼林陀夫地方之阿斯肯那工廠兩工廠時，發現上述之隱匿軍火，但官方並不指出該某國家之名。事後美方即在該廠四周駐有偵緝人員，並將該廠大門關閉，派軍入內搜查，有五人已被捕逮，並根據盟國管制當局之禁止製造，運輸或藏有戰爭物之條例，予以看管。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林二日電〕據調查美佔區內爲「某外國」製造戰爭物資兩工廠之美國調查主任波伊爾上校稱。兩工廠所製造者均爲蘇聯佔領區內泰爾托夫公司之定貨，泰爾托夫與該兩廠有密切關係，然波氏拒絕指明〔某外國」爲何國。據某德國記者之報導，在歐戰結束美軍尙未到達柏林前，蘇聯軍隊已將該二廠中許多設備搬運至柏林蘇軍佔區，若干工程師與技師亦同行。該兩工廠被搜查之消息傳出後，德國各報均以大字登載，惟蘇軍機關報僅略爲提及，並削去「某外國」牽連在內之一節云。</p>

<h3>日內瓦國際關稅協定　英聲明暫不簽字　謂英必須施行歧視性進口管制</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦一日電〕英政府業已知照美國，聲明不能簽訂日內瓦貿完會議中將近完成之多方面關稅協定，除非該協定中禁止施行歧視性進口管制之款免除英國履行始可。</p>
<p>關係方面相信英商務大臣克里浦斯昨在巴黎晤美副國務卿克萊登時，即係以此爲生題。據悉，克里浦斯已昭吿克萊登，至少在一年以內，英國當不能不施行歧視性之進口管制，以撙節其外匯。美方人士認爲英國此項表示，不但將破壞日內瓦談判中之關稅協定，且將妨礙美國國會之就馬歇爾援歐建議，採取有利行動。全球性貿易規則協定之訂立，勢將因缺乏英國之支持而擱淺，果爾則美國援助英國及歐洲復興所望獲得之唯一代價，將化爲烏有。美國與英談判財政協定以及最近之發動援助戰後世界之計劃，原期得因此完遂其貿易政策之目標，今英國業已肯定請求美國免其履行，英美財政協定中第九條不得歧視自美國進口物之義務，英國若再拒絕簽訂關稅協定或獲得禁止歧視進口之款之免除履行，則西半球諸國以及各美元區國家將受重大打擊。</p>

<h3>同車謀財害命　捕獲英人却利　承認與死者做過交易嫌疑重大收押</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察總局外事組，昨晚會同新成分局，捉獲一英人「却利」其全名鸞「却利·阿却」（CHARLIEARCHER）疑即爲前晚在靑浦縣境槍殺余盛孝之兇手。</p>
<p>但却利·阿却在警局之供詞，則矢口否認，而所供各點，又多與各證人之證詞頗有令人可疑之處。警局方面承辦人員，以昨日爲星期六，故未及通知英國領事館，致偵查經過情形尙不能對外發表。</p>
<p>此案之經過，爲一甬人名余盛孝者，年三十一歲，以販賣饅頭食物起家，旣有積蓄，遂兼作黑市金鈔買賣。前日晨，有一西人前往買金條五根，並約下午交款。屈時西人同乘汽車而出，駛至靑浦縣境七寳鎭吳家巷地方，余盛孝突被該西人槍殺，推落荒野，嗣爲鄕人發現，時已血流滿地，氣息奄奄，詢其究竟，僅言：「名余盛孝，住天潼路六二三號，殺彼者名却利」。言畢即不省人事，在送醫院途中，氣絕身死。當時身中三槍，二在頭部，一在胸部。</p>
<p>警局得報後，遂根據所言地名，前往天潼路大二三號調查，據其妻談：其夫生前曾在中央路一帶經營黑市金鈔，與一西人名却利者，素有來往，前日晨間却利曾向其夫購買金條五根，其夫外出後，竟一去未返。</p>
<p>警察總局接獲報吿後，即至中央路一帶調查却利踪跡，當在余之同業處探得確有却利其人，並知其住址，即晚將其捕獲。</p>
<p>據却利阿却對警局調查人員稱：渠與余曾有美金六十元之交易一起，此外並無其他往來，前日亦未與余約定見面時間，渠前日於五時許返家，對槍殺余盛孝事完全不知。</p>
<p>警員於昨晚曾將有關各點向却利阿却反覆詢問，然却利阿却堅稱渠本人並無車輛，且亦未曾去過靑浦一帶。</p>
<p>按却利阿却爲英人，出生於香港，年卅三，於敵偽時期在集中營內，結識一俄婦，迨勝利後，始正式結婚。至此事發生後，據俄婦語記者，謂却利阿却爲一正當商人，決不致有殺人之行爲，在中央路十五號樓上，與一華人陸某開設字號，前晨離寓後，至下午四五時返家，晚間九時且曾相偕至金門戲院觀看「回首話當年」。當時曾與現任虹橋療養院之牙醫相値，意謂此牙醫可以作證也。</p>
<p>當俄婦言及上述事實時，態度頗爲從容，但對却利阿却返家之確實時間，以及牙醫之姓名，則又多含糊其詞，不能確指。</p>
<p>記者繼詢其却利阿却旣爲正當商人，應有友人可資證明。俄婦對此又稱，却利阿却所識之英美人士，爲數甚多，但恐不願前來證明耳。</p>
<p>繼又詢其家居究在何處，俄婦稱：「亞爾培路十六號」一西人經營之小客棧內。但事後經記者前往尋訪時，則又無此號碼。然據却利阿却對警局供述時，又謂家住「亞爾培路一八六弄四號」，迨記者再度往詢時，該處爲一公寓式之小客棧，惟店主則堅稱住戶中絕無却利阿却其人。</p>
<p>據一般估計：七寳與上海之間，汽車行駛時局約需一小時，故槍殺案如發生於下午五時許，則兇手可能於下午九時以前從容返滬。雖其妻曾謂却利阿却係於下午四五時間返寓所，但對此無人可作證明。</p>
<p>當警局人員前往中央路向其同業調查時，則頗有人指却利阿却是日確曾與余盛孝約定下午三時至四時之聞，在四川路寗波路發達洋服店內交款，並曾目睹渠與余盛孝同車向外灘方面駛去。警局以却却阿却夫婦嫌疑重大，立令扣押，正積極進行偵查中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕蘇州河中，昨午後四時許在河南路橋下撈獲年輕女屍兩具，腰間有紅褲帶一條，彼此相繫。兩女屍年均在十六七歲左右，各梳二小辮。一穿花洋布短衫，內襯粉紅色汗馬甲，下爲黑條毛葛褲，內襯紅短褲，脚穿短襪紅鞋。另一具着條子布短衫，內亦襯紅馬甲，下穿黑府綢褲。襯白洋布短褲，白襪紅鞋。紅褲帶原爲前一屍所繫，而復與後一女屍之咖啡色褲帶結連者。當撈起時，兩屍面目如生，斷知投水尙未久。身上旣無傷痕，亦一無遺物。因何雙雙投水，原因不明。</p>

<h3>寄養豫北難民　豫省妥籌救濟辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報開封訊〕近日來由　北每日南渡難民，　集於鄭州·洛陽·開封等地者，為數過多，豫省府為改善救濟，已飭社會處擬具奇養豫北難民辦法，已於廿九日省委會通過。茲探錄辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於鄭州方面者：（一）社會處鄭縣急振工作，以截至七月底止，自八月一日起，專辦難民疏　　　。（一）社會處鄭縣急振工作隊，照原預算，應於七月底撤銷，八月一日起，另在鄭縣成立疏遣難民工作站。（三）鄭縣原辦三處粥廠，第一廠即行停止，二三兩廠，就現有物資使用，俟食完時撤銷。（四）救分署所　食糧一百噸，以配合難民疏散爲主，（五）疏遣難民站，擬于急振工作結束後，調用該隊一部份人員，辦理疏　事宜，另擬預算書，簽請省府委會核議，疏遣難民費用，在中央振款未撥到前，擬向出糧處暫借二億地，以應急需。</p>
<p>（一）關於洛陽方而者：（一）洛陽難民除巳撥一億元查放急振外，擬另在洛陽成立疏遣難民站，並再撥一億元，充疏遣難民之用。（二）救分署撥定洛陽食糧六十噸，配合疏遣難民之用。</p>

<h3>對外交通窒息　神州儼如「孤島」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕福州去年平均每月尙有二百餘艘航船出入此港口，最近數月情况甚爲惡化，各綫船隻稀，如唯一航行榕滬綫之客輪「舟山」號，近已停駛，榕台綫原有台航公司客輪數艘經常駛行，目前僅有「台航一號」一艘，儎重僅百餘噸，船小客多，每班均擁擠不堪；榕廈綫唯一定期班船爲閩江下游公司之「鴨綠江」號快艇，亦僅爲百噸左右之小火輪；他如北方航綫均無定期航船，耑賴偶然間行駛之貨輪附搭若干旅客。在空運方面，中國中央兩航空公司在榕均設有中間站，前者曾闢榕滬，榕廈，榕港穗等綫，最近因與主管機塲之空軍站有意見，已吿停航福州；後者僅每週滬榕南昌漢口往返班機一次，福州旣屬中途站，班次少，所以坐位有限，而且，福州義嶼機塲沒有跑道，談不上機塲設備，遇天雨，地面濘泥堆積，飛機便不能着陸，這一個半殘廢的航空基地，能够給空運的便利到甚麼程度，可想而知。至陸運方面：由榕赴浙，贛，粵各地，只賴若干破舊不堪之「老爺車」跋涉於荒漠山道，旅人裹足。在此海陸空三方面不暢通之情况下，使福州對外交通成「隔絕」狀態，在榕人士不無「窒息」之感，一般旅客抵榕後，恒坐困無法啟程他去，成以「死港」「愁城」喩之。交通之疏暢，耑賴貨運爲其吸引力，目前陷於半停頓之原因，係貨運因生產疲蹶及進出口貿易减少，而起之直接影響，招商局巨輪之拒駛福州，乃由於無貨可運，無利可圖，各輪船公司之放棄福州航綫，原因亦在此。據交通界人士表示，輪船開來福州，貨運儎不滿，客運則非法不購票旅客太多，輪商不堪虧累，乃趨畏避，如此種情况可以改善，福州航運或有轉機可能。（特派記老陳正予寄自福州）</p>

<h3>台省府着手興修　介壽館迄未動工</h3>
<p>〔台北訊〕台北介籌館修建工程，自去年開始已有半年有餘，雖經各方熟心倡導募捐修建款項，並成立修建工程委員會，籌劃修建事宜，省民自動捐贈，極爲踴躍，然因物價不時上漲，去年之估價，至目前已相差甚大，致數月以來，僅從事繪圖，設計等，至修建工程，幾未勸工。近以籌募經費困難，當局巳取消原議，并撤消該工程委員會，因省府決以該址爲省府總辦公處，事權及管理均可集中，魏主席對此亦甚關心。據悉：全部經費約需台幣三萬萬元，現省府巳批准撥補台幣約二萬萬元，交台省公共工程局重修，並責成儘一年內完竣，該局現已着手興修云。按該址原爲台灣總督府廳舍，在民國卅四年五月卅一日被盟機大轟炸，破壞慘重。</p>

<h3>蒙旗女王　奇俊峯　母子遇害</h3>
<p>本報記者楊昌七月廿七日包頭航訊</p>
<p>七月二十日下午，奇俊峯被殺的消息傳到歸綏，旋即傳遍全城。</p>
<p>烏伊兩盟十三旗平均每隔四年就有一次流血的政爭，不過兩派都不加害幼主，誰也願意懷抱着小王、手執着扎薩克兵印，號令念經的喇嘛，閒散的台吉，和水遠充當奴隸的「黑人」。這次幼主和女王同時遇難，一方面說明王爺世襲到今天，已經不被人民目爲神聖，一方面也說明政爭愈演愈慘，反對黨爲免除後患都在一不做二不休的斬草除根。西公旗因女王幼主被害，形成當前綏蒙的時局中心，直到今天西公旗的代表才由包頭到達歸綏，將來情勢還不知道如何演變。</p>
<p>西公旗是個小國，屬烏拉特部，烏拉特和四子部落，喀爾喀右翼旗（即達爾罕旗），茂明安旗在一塊會盟，統稱烏蘭察布盟。烏拉特部共分三旗，前旗就是西公旗，中旗是中公旗，後旗是東公旗。烏拉特部和四子部落，喀爾喀部，茂明安部，雖然都是　成吉思汗的子孫，但不屬於同一支流。民國成立以來，各旗無形中獨立自治，盟長已經等於虛設。國民政府和省政府每年拿出許多糧餉子彈款項，無條件的給蒙旗培植軍隊，辦理學校，賑濟災民，蒙旗的統治者僅僅拿出幾匹彩緞戰馬，却經過省政府向國民政府換回扎薩克，保安司令，東西協理一類的名正言順的任職狀令。西公旗的地圖好像一柄顚倒的如意，它佔有整個烏拉山，和半個狼山，平原有大佘太的明暗川，烏拉山前的中灘，和狼山下的烏加河兩岸的河浜。</p>
<p>抗戰把西公旗分成兩部，安北以東的烏拉山區成了額寳齊的天下，安北以西的狼山區成了奇俊峯的世界。西公旗的精華在烏拉山區，而不在狼山區，奇俊峯招募後套的漢人和色令布的兒子郝猶龍，勉强組織了五六百騎兵，但是不能和額寳齊抗衡，所以勝利回來，仍將向綏遠省政府要求恢復額寳齋的原職。郝猶龍雖然年靑，但是利用國軍受降包頭和共軍圍攻包頭，點收了僞軍和共軍的不少槍枝，已經形成繼承他父親的一支力量。由於奇俊峯署理扎薩克兼保安司令，使旁人不能署理扎薩克當保安司令，早在去年冬天由西公旗學生出名，將奇俊峯最親信的參謀主任收押到十二戰區軍法監部的獄中。本月十五日西公旗開「楚格拉」，女王宣布撤去郝猶龍的職務，並聲言要扣押額寳齋，在二十日回包頭的路上便見叛兵喬裝成土匪的刺客。</p>
<p>奇俊峯和奇法和是蒙旗內部紛爭下的犧牲品，小王今年十二歲，好像曇花一現，女王今年三十三歲，她的一生充滿悲劇的氣氛。女王是阿拉善親王的孫女，達拉特親王兒媳的養女。她的出身非常高貴，但是紅顏薄命。他的父親德毅忱和大哥羅景瑞，於民國二十年及二十三年，因爲協助馮玉祥將軍從事國民革命，被已過的塔王和現在的達王先後殺害，她在十二歲時便離開定遠營的公主府邸，流亡到姑母奇老太太的家中。她原先漢名羅玉蘭，後來給姑母認爲養女，才改名現在的奇俊峯。奇俊峯和石王在二十三年結婚，並不是出於自願—而是做了奇老太太的政治禮物。這個老太太自幼長在北平的皇宮，受她舅母慈禧太后的影響很大，奇俊峯在抗戰期間所以全國馳名，完全得力於姑母的運籌帷幄。奇俊峯並非如重慶報紙上宣染的那樣美如仙人，不過倒很莊嚴淑靜，她能說很流利的官話，這是阿拉善旗貴族的特點；她雖然小學畢業，由於石王死後勤於自學，可以閱讀書報，批閱公文，公開講演亦娓娓動聽。她在臥室中也穿着戎裝，除了保持女王的尊嚴，還表示要做一個蒙古巾幗英雄。奇俊峯和石王祗生了一個兒子，人們對此有許多傳說，反對她的人說是來歷不明。這個孩子蒙古名字叫阿拉坦鄂齊爾；和杭錦旗的阿王同名，所以又稱小阿王，爲什麼小阿王姓他母親的奇姓，原來成吉思汗的嫡系子孫都姓奇，綏蒙聞人中姓奇的不下一百餘人。小阿王三歲時，曾在蔣主席面前高呼過「擁護領袖」的口號，他在陜壩和歸綏的小學校裏讀書，都是名列優等的學生。奇俊峯原先準備自己執政，計劃交奇法武到美國留學，誰想他像慧星被暴風雨一樣夭殞。西公旗的烏拉山和狼山在經濟上是兩座寳庫，在國際上是八百里長的長城，西公旗如果讓奇俊峯在十年內完成統一，讓奇法武由美國回來建設，很可以變成有煤有鐵有魚有米的肥沃邊境。總之奇俊峯母子之被害，是蒙旗的損失，也是國家的不幸。</p>

<h3>紡調會議價小組會决定　棉紗新價明日掛牌　以後毎週一三五掛牌一次</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會議價小組會於昨日下午四時起，在中央銀行總裁室舉行。到劉攻芸·吳味經·榮爾仁·程敬堂·張文潛·張方佐等，列席王啓字·高炳奉等。討論結果母女定對今後棉紗議價，隨時空酌巿面實際情形，及棉紗實際生產成本，作機動式之調整。紡　會第一次議價，尚係上月一日所決定。即廿支標準紗，每件八八〇萬元。其他各支紗，依比例推算，此價迄未調整。茲新議價決於明日上午十時，由紡調會正式公告。此後每週一三五掛牌一次，議價小組會各委員，則於每週二四六，先作接觸，俾議定次日掛牌價格。議價小組會並定每週舉行正式會議一鎰，議價由紡建公司掛牌，民營紗廠開紗，亦一併遵照牌價辦理云。</p>
<h3>大戶紛買人心振奮　華股週末起漲風　永紗以高價結束美亞亦俏</h3>
<p>華股昨突形俏利，買戶得報載新幣發生，及巿商會要求財部對銀錢業之當日支票不能抵用，加以修正之說，人心大振，漲風激烈，更得外股之動力，大戶若二三五號大康成，及一七七號和興之越買越勇，永紗在大量實貨流出中，仍得以俏利之局結束，活動派亦有助買，餘股則僅新光亦見振作外，略見興奮。</p>
<p>晨開已昂，開後遞永紗自二三一元起，經一五四號一一七號九四號一四二號二三一號六八號一一六號一〇三號二二三號二二四號買進，逐步拉上，二二三號一一六號並進現永紗，遞交乃漲到二四二元。一五七號一七一號一五二號二三二號一三三號一八〇號乘高脫手面稍低，二二四號二二三號二三五號九七號八五號乘機尚納而見盤。</p>
<p>十時後，一〇七號七六號四號一二六號九七號均進，一三〇號並購現永紗，而漲到二四六元及二四二元高價，十時二十分後，一二六號一一七號一三〇號二二三號雖進現永紗，八五號二三五號不時買進遞紗，八號一七一號二三一號一四號一五七號五六號一九六號二三二號六五號紛售，二一八號一六二號並售，二一八號一六二號並售現永紗。</p>
<p>十一時後，遞永紗跌至二三八元，現永紗至二三五元以下，惟二三五號一七七號同時力購現永紗及遞永紗。午收除永紗新光仍堅外，餘股不過平穩。永紗以二四三元及二四〇元之價結束，收後喊價平和。</p>
<p>結果較前收即交股計永紗美亞漲半成强，永公景福升半成弱，新光中法信和勤興小升，新華平平，中絲漲起一成，榮豐商務漲半成光景，餘股雖漲而有限。遞交股計永紗美亞漲半成强，新光升半成弱，信和華豐景福勤興微升，塲外各股普遍微升。</p>
<p>又訊：信和紗廠增資，自八月七日起警停遞交，八月八日起即交亦暫停資買。</p>
<h3>統債一致升　外股買風熾</h3>
<p>公債昨飛黃騰達，受新幣之說推動，統內晨開即升至一一六〇〇元，自一一五〇〇元步漲到一四二〇〇元，而後退至一三〇〇〇元結束。紗花帮以及四四二室五五五室俱進，三六〇室及曹某則賣，成交增至一千萬左右，結果較前收計甲乙丙丁各漲二千元，統戍好起二千一。</p>
<p>外股昨買風頓熾，證券帮錢兌業以及黃某力購，怡紗自晨開八九〇〇〇元，拉高到九六五〇〇元，廣帮洋商脫手，匯水亦未見助買，即退至九二五〇〇元，證券帮中大戶童某再來吸收，立見重振，不易獲得對手，轉向航業進取。午收仍倘，結果較前收計怡紗航業各漲一成內外，餘股各好半成强。</p>
<h3>人絲初高後回　廠經綢貨均呆疲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨巿上午稍高，下午與上日軋平，一二〇號高山有光二千五百萬元左右開盤，最高到五百二十萬元收盤。下午因乏人過問，價稍抑低，最後為四百八十萬元，其餘各牌貨，均與上日價相同無上落。</p>
<p>廠經交易清淡，行情較上日軋小二十萬至五十萬元之譜。昨巿八三分勻度C字等級做開五擔，貨款五天期頭，價做二千八百八十萬，其餘各級只有喊價。干經交易亦稀，次者喊價仍為一千六百萬元，但無成交。二十八分零擔，一千七百萬元有成交，貨款亦有七天期。</p>
<p>綢貨昨日開巿甚疲，大誠被面先做一千〇三十五萬元，後因買多於賣，冉冉上升，最後收巿即期做四十二萬元，週一期五十萬元。華强被面一千〇三十二三萬元，開巿後頗有成交，最後成交價為三十八萬元，週一期做四十六萬元。大誠格子璧縐銷令已過，巿價獨軟，三萬三千五百喊賣出價，三千二百元有人要，其他各貨，塲內成交極微，巿價大致穩定。</p>
<h3>紗價臨收回挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗巿况，初開時長江一帶客帮吸意轉濃，雖逢週六，但銀根仍鬆，交易頗夥，巿勢上揚。迨至收時，民營廠有貨開出，散戶聞訊傾吐，人心頓虛，價遂回挫。結果四二支藍鳳紗一千七百十五萬元，較上日蜀犬吠日瀉十萬元。二十支雙馬紗則軋升五萬，為一千零九十萬元。全日趨勢以二十支金城雙地球及十六支光明十支童子軍金寶星等粗紗挺俏外，其餘四二支水月卅二支藍鳳及廿支十六支各牌粗細紗價一致回挫云。</p>
<h3>棉布實銷閑散</h3>
<p>昨日棉布巿况，晨開以散戶哄抬，龍頭細布曾昂至四十四萬三千元，旋因北帮及福建帮業中人等逢高吐售，巿勢再入軟檔。檯面搶帽子交易頗多，實銷依然閑散。最後十二磅記頭細布回低至四十三萬五千元，比上日軋升二千五百元。五福彩球藍鶴陽鶴等各細布亦均上升一二千至四五千元不一，其餘色布士林布等站定</p>
<p>又訊，紡建公司照例開售白坯，掛牌仍以二十支特細布價為三十三萬六千元，四君子元嗶嘰四十七萬五千元，申購者不少。</p>
<h3>第三季輸入限額　明日可以發表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會本年第三季各項輸入限額，已決定於明日在各報發表。據悉：內以菸葉一項，所减較多。柴油稍增，總額並未有如外傅减少美金七百餘萬之鉅。</p>
<p>又第一類生產器材之申請金額，刻已達美金三億元以上。惟經輸管會核准之金額，僅美金一千餘萬元。可見當局核給外匯嚴格之一般云。</p>
<h3>中行六月份僑匯　較五月份銳减</h3>
<p>中國銀行頃發表六月份經收僑匯數字，共計三十八億四千三百廿九萬零七百廿四元九角五，紐約最多，計廿三億四千四百七十萬零五千三百三十五元二角，倫敦三億零五八百八十萬零八千七百五十元零一角五，古巴四億二千一百八十一萬九千一百廿五元，雪梨五千四百零九萬一千五百八十六元，加爾各答七千二百九十萬令九千八百十四元六角，仰光二千零七萬三千元，新加坡一百五十五萬元，吉隆坡四十一萬四千五百元，檳榔嶼二百三十六萬一千五百九十元，西貢一千一百六十九萬零二百元，巴達維亞三億七千五百萬。國外代理店為二億二百八十六萬六千八百廿四元，按五月份該行經手僑匯共為一百〇五億三千六百六十六萬六千七百三十一元三角六分。四月份為二百〇二億七千一百五十八萬七千八百〇四元五角。</p>

<p>又查昨日各商業銀行內匯率有如如後列：（每千元）</p>

<h3>食米去化略動　粳秈稍呈緊俏</h3>
<p>昨日南北巿共到米糧三千四百餘石，內地轉定，店方零化有勁，略見活絡。粳米回高三五千至萬元，秈米亦呈緊俏之狀，巿况起落無常，暫入盤旋之局。白元陰元價無變動，浦束新粳續到二十餘石，隨到隨銷，形勢平正。</p>
<p>麵粉供求兩少，趨勢堅定，廠粉微挺千元，雜牌粉平平，惟洋粉則夏令銷化奇旺，飛騰萬元。麩皮亦然回昂一二千元。豆餅略升一二千元，終以實銷平常，午時仍趨軟化，黃豆參差互見，東北大豆及新豆轉漲三五千元，杜黃及漢黃依然平疲。</p>
<p>菉豆交易寥寥，中次續削三五千元，赤豆平庸，苞米酒精廠停辦，回跌三五千元，紅糧挺秀，生仁華南納胃不爽，本街銷路清淡，平疲之勢。莞豆貨稀穩定，小麥堅定，蠶豆客帮略進，本街另化有勁，高貨續挺二三千元，中關平定。</p>
<p>油巿甬方問津，巿氣活靈，生油上漲二三萬元，蔴油亦漲二三萬元，清汕豆油均見回升一二萬元，菜油帶升萬餘元。</p>
<p>蘇米價劇降</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州二日電〕蘇糧價今已急劇下瀉，巿塲做開白米三十六萬四千元，糙粳三十二萬八千元，白秈廿四萬元，門售白米卅九萬元。</p>
<p>糯米枝見新</p>
<p>糯米枝　本屆新貨價格仍高，以其有洋莊去化，而產量不多所致。高貨劃申須五百數十萬元，首批略有到申，但質地較遜，昨開四百四十萬元。</p>
<h3>首批台糖百噸　運往新加坡</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北二日電〕台砂糖一百噸，已於上月自高雄港運往新加坡銷售，此為戰後台砂軍入國際巿塲角逐之　矢，今據台灣糖業公司稱：「第二批砂糖二百噸，已運存高雄港，即將仍由英輪續運新加坡銷售。」自荷印陷於長期戰亂以來，爪哇糖業，一蹶不振，南洋諸　所需之食糖，現亦仰賴台灣，惟台糖現亦仍在復興期中。同時我國內地需糖甚多，上停砂糖三百噸，僅為試銷性質，顯然尚難大量供應南洋之需求。至於台糖五萬噸，運銷日本一事，據該公司稱：「價格問題迄未商妥，啓運尚無確期。」並聞所謂價格問題，在台糖公司方面，認為應敷成本，而麥帥總部則認為售價過高，致未獲得解決。</p>
<h3>輸出推廣會通過　收購新茶辦法原則　詳細實施辦法交小組會研究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會，為商討卅六年度新茶之收購事宜，特於昨日上午十時，舉行臨時執委會議。到沈熙瑞等多人，由沈熙瑞主席。討論經過，對收購茶葉方案確定。惟詳細實施辦法，另推中央銀行劉攻芸，中信局沈熙瑞，中農行王伯天三人組織小組會議，並聘中茶聯營公司鄧以誠，國行顧問馬格二人為顧問。此外並邀集茶葉專家，共同商訂辦法。聞小組會已定明日下午三時集會商討，擬定辦法後，待呈請行政院核定後，即付施行。</p>
<p>農行處理　箱茶押品</p>
<p>卅五年度箱茶，到期尚未贖回，亦未向中信局申請收購者，農民銀行遵照四聯總處決定，處理其押品，並代中信局收購。據該行發表處理押品之統計，共有箱茶五種，計五萬八千八百九十四箱。（一）祁紅一萬五千零四十九箱，（二）屯綠一百八十六箱，（三）平綠四萬二千九百五十八箱，（四）溫紅三百一十三箱，（五）王綠三百八十八箱，押款為一百三十餘億。</p>
<p>該行為體念茶商起見，在各種茶業品級未鑑定以前，除扣還押款與棧租，利息外，先付茶價六成與茶商，其餘四成，一俟品級鑑定，及各級茶價評定以後，再於軍週一（四日）開會解決。中信局農行，茶葉聯營公司，商品檢騐局等四單位，均派員參加，各級品級鑑定後，即按標準價格，分別作價，預計半月內，是項工作全部可了</p>
<p>新祁紅茶　難獲成交</p>
<p>蒞滬多時之本年度祁門新紅茶，連日吐納談判雖仍絡繹，惟賣戶堅持，每担非得三百萬元不忍割愛，而據進方意見，如在關內，尚有胃納，依現狀觀察，暫時恐難獲得成交。其他花色，本街店莊及客帮續有垂詢，尤以低擋陳紅茶為甚，做開行情，則一致　站有勁，至洋莊茶巿，進出依然兩稀，過程岑靜非凡</p>
<p>台糖續鬆</p>
<p>又訊：昨糖巿以去化仍滯，台糖續見略鬆。公會劃盤，二〇中砂白五十五萬元，小五千元。台赤仍五十六萬元，四半白六十五萬元，小萬元。汕揭陽青四十三萬元至四十二萬七千元，數十包。刁青廿包，三十五萬元。興化白袋裝高貨六十萬元，簍裝五十七萬元。興赤高貨四十三萬五千元至四十三萬元，僅百數件。</p>
<h3>溝通台省手資　中信成立台灣分局</h3>
<p>中信局為發展業務，溝通台灣省對外物資交流起見，特在台灣設立分局，並派周紹曾為經理。周氏日前銜命赴台，晋謁魏主席，並向各有關機關接洽，業已返滬向總局陳述經過。記者頃往叩詢，據稱：台省光復以後，一切生產事業，亟待發展，急需向外輸入機器原料及種籽等項，並輸出各項產品，中信局總局前在該省設立辦事處，辦理重要物資輸出輸入交換事宜，業務頗為繁劇。茲為加强發展，特在台成立分局，今後主要業務，將依照法令辦理物資輸出輸入及對國外易貨事宜，並將舉辦公私機關委託購料及產物保險，人壽保險，俾協助政府促進經濟建設云。</p>
<h3>肥皂供多下挫</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂巿面，因傅固本皂即將派貨，每箱配價為四十六萬元，致買戶頗為躊躇，兼以黃祥茂皂仍有轉售，塲內供多求少，巿乃下挫。迨至最後，固本皂每箱跌至四十七萬三千元，比上日軋小七千元。箭刀皂亦跌五千元，為四十七萬元。其餘祥茂光華日月等皂，巿亦下挫二三千元不一。火柴火油尚告平定。</p>
<h3>捲烟工業提五項建議　向輸管會爭取外匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本巿捲烟工業同業公會日前為烟葉外匯之分配問題，致函輸管會。略謂：過去兩次烟葉外匯，均經貴會配交各進口商行採購烟葉，各進口行似應依法供給各烟廠，為合理之訂購。惟據本會所知，自前項外匯先後核撥，我會員烟廠所得合理之訂購，為數無幾。其餘外匯，任進口行自由處置，或仍任烟葉居間商轉輾牟利，坐使美葉售價，抬高甚鉅。茲特提出下開各項建議，尚祈加以採納。按建議共五項係該公會日前舉行常務理事會所議決，大致如下（一）請輸管會抄示以前各期烟葉外匯分配紀錄，包括（甲）配撥各進口行之分戶戶名，及外匯數量。（乙）各進口行配售予各烟廠之分戶廠名，及外匯數量，並其所售烟葉之成交價格。（二）以後自第三期起，請責成各進口行，依據可得外匯，將訂購合同，先送本會副署證明後，再送貴會核撥外匯。倘無本會副署證明者，不予撥付。（三）以後配撥烟葉外匯，似應以該進口行在戰前有其歷史，而經營烟葉有經騐者為限。（四）外埠例須分潤限額，外滙經分配時，必須有硬性之比例規定。例如第一二兩期配撥紙圈外匯，本埠中外烟廠共得六分之五，外埠烟廠合得六分之一。而推算烟葉外匯時，因外埠所出之捲烟品質較低，需用美葉自少，似其比例猶可從低核定。（五）進口商售價，依據可得外匯酌定行盤時，倘有暴利企圖，使用廠不願向其訂貨，經與交涉，而仍置不理者，應即取消其外匯配額，將該配額改撥其他進口行云</p>
<h3>工業原料分配問題　各工業同業工會非常重視　潘士浩云工商業不應磨擦</h3>
<p>本巿各工業同業公會四十餘單位為輸入限額工業原料之分配問題，已收集資料，編成節略。定於星期三推舉代表赴京，向中樞各有關機關申訴。今日（即三日）正午三時假座南京路慈淑大樓星五聚餐會，約集工業界領視同曁新聞界名流，交換意見，並報名三個月來之經過。聞其公開之資料中將指出分配處之失着，商業公會之誤解，及進口業之過慮。對於經過期間分配處之陽待協議，實在開放。以致工業界方以為有十分理由可靠，商業與進口業却不無自己遺憾。據潘士浩氏語人，巿商會及工業協會因謀工業原料之合理分配，乃商同輸管會分配處於各工業間謀取協調。因外匯結價之優惠，甚望工業原料分配之能助於工業界。對於商業，擬酌予配額以資協調。至於進口商更尊重其經手居間之立塲。其輸入限額工業原料分配審議委員會之設立，由巿商會及工協各推理事十人組成之。開會時曾邀請進口商及有關商業公會派代表列席，用意蓋在避免工業商業進口業三方面相互間之磨擦也。終因主管機關於限額之分配，僅做到分給進口商為止。工商業間之大比例，除棉花·羊毛·烟葉·紙漿·橡膠，因性較單純，指定直接歸工業取得外。其關係較複雜者，如化工原料染料五金等，迄未為大量之劃分。以致公會負責人不免各為其本公會之會員打算，而工商協議無成。第一季限額，且於審議會協議未成之際，為捷足者設法簽取垂盡矣。此於國家政策工商道德，均有未符。本人主張工業原料應為工業所得，工商業如遇應持分配之輸入品，政府應明白指定其比例，以昭公允，而免磨擦云。瀋氏末又指出正軌合理之進口商，必有其存在之價値，且有其有益於國際貿易之意義，工業界從未一筆抹煞</p>
<p>杉木疲呆</p>
<p>杉木巿價仍難以振作，疲呆在六百元，洋松巿價亦在瘟檔中，現木材一般巿價因穩定多日，回下亦難，若不受意外刺激，恐將盤旋多日。</p>

<p>編輯先生：友人某甲於民國卅四年勝利後，以漢奸罪被拘。至卅五年四月經法院判處有期徒刑二年六月。距被拘時間已逾一年又兩個月，今疑申請假釋。茲有法律疑問三點，祈賜答覆。（一）依刑法第七十七條假釋第一項但書之規定，凡有期徒刑之執行未滿一年者不在此限。今某甲被拘已逾一年，據申請假釋，是否須除去拘禁時間，抑須自判決之日起再過一年始能申請？（二）依同法同條第二項之規定，「前項執行期間遇有第四十六條情形者，以所餘之刑期計算。」所謂「所餘刑期」，是否指裁判確定時所餘之刑期？今茶甲判刑二年六月，除去被拘之一年二月，是否再執行所餘刑期之二分之一，即八個月，方可假釋？（二）綜上各點，某甲如擬申請假釋，應用何種手續行之？　訊得沈均可上</p>
<p>〔姜屛藩律師答〕（一）刑法第七十七條第一項但書規定，「有期徒刑執行未滿一年者不在此限」云云，乃指此種情形不能申請假釋而言，甲旣被法院判處有期徒刑二年六月，自不適用該條但書之規定。（二）假釋刑期應從裁判確定之日起算。（三）甲之情形應自判決確定日起執行，所餘刑期二分之一後，方可由監獄長官呈司法行政最高官署許可假釋。</p>

<h3>梅百器週年祭</h3>
<p>— 酉廷</p>
<p>——『聰明的孩子多消瘦，美麗的女兒容易老。』</p>
<p>同樣理由，偉大的音音音音樂天才，也容易夭折：貝多芬卅二歲便害了耳聾疾，天才被毁了一半，莫扎特以及中國的黃自，冼星海，聶耳，偏偏都是短命的天才，有着那樣豐富的昔樂智慧，竟宋及中年即撒手而去。</p>
<p>去年今日（一九四六·八月三日），上海喪失了一位遠東音樂大師。他在第一次大戰結束那年到了上海，一直爲上海的音樂文化服務，他使上海許多人有了赴音樂會的習慣，他使許多上海後起的音樂家以及音樂學校的學生，受到他良好的影響。今日上海唯一的交響樂團便是這位音樂大師廿餘年心血灌溉的成果。</p>
<p>這位已經歸到另一世界的音樂家便是上海音樂聽衆所最熟悉的梅百器先生（Maestro　Mario　Pace）。他便是上海租界淪陷後偶爾出現於蘭心戲院交響樂演奏會而被羣衆熱烈歡迎的那位禿頂老頭的指揮。（按那時梅氏已因日人强迫主持交響樂隊而放棄指揮職務，正與托斯卡尼尼不願與法西斯合作而出走一樣。）</p>
<p>雖然，他不是短命天才，（享年六十八歲）但在昔樂糧食如是飢饉的上海，他竟沒有機會給我們更多的藝術建樹，終令人歎息　惋！</p>
<p>一八七八年，他生長於義大利，七歲便在一所著名的昔樂學校中學習鋼琴，十一歲開始公開演奏。這在音樂之邦的義大利，固不足令人驚奇，但這樣早熟的成功，無論如何顯示着他的前程，然而，他的父親却反對他完全獻身於音樂。這是與許多有名音樂家一樣的艱辛身世。</p>
<p>因此，梅百器在「自傳」里這樣的申訴着：</p>
<p>『在十四歲那年，有一天，我售掉我所有的書及僅有的貴重物品——一隻古老的大掛表，得到了些里拉（義幣），自拿波列逃到羅馬。』</p>
<p>到羅馬去是爲了尋訪一位名鋼琴家李斯特的一位最後的學生Sgambati教授。他往訪這位教授，却被侍僕擋了　：「教授對於任何沒有介紹信的人是不　見的」。</p>
<p>孤伶困苦的幼年梅百賂，在羅馬經過無數的打擊後，終於在一八九五年榮獲李斯特獎金的國際音樂競賽的優勝。</p>
<p>不久，受近代名歌劇作家普奇尼（Prcini）的賞識，現代名指揮托斯卞尼尼的薰陶，他的技藝便蒸蒸日上。奔放的個性又使他不安於「靜」，一九〇二年他決定週遊全世界，一九一八年底便到了上海，不料病魔把他留住了，第二年便出任上海工部局樂隊的指揮，樂隊也因此被充實。在他嚴格的訓練與管理下，這二十餘年來，樂隊的成績中外人士莫不盛讚。去年市府交響樂隊爲梅百器舉行了一次紀念演奏會，許多熱情聽衆緬懷梅氏的技藝與建樹，不期然地都熱淚盈眶，幾位担任演奏的名家也露現了內心的沉痛。這令我永遠不能忘懷！</p>
<p>最易使人沉思而細細咀嚼的是：梅氏的艱辛身世，而最令上海音樂聽衆響往的是他對樂隊的事務上的管理及技藝上的督促。這是音樂界朋友所念念不忘的。</p>
<p>今日樂隊由音專管理，富華教授指揮，雖然演奏人員减少了一些，我們相信一定也能够繼承以往的成績與光榮！</p>

<h3>題畫的技巧</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>國晝家對於一張畫的繪製完成，多必題款或加題詩文在畫上，這便是題畫。本來唐宋的畫家對於題畫，不是怎樣的注意。有些畫只有樹石或空隙間寫一個姓名，甚至絕對的沒有題姓名；加題詩詞文，更談不到了。可是後來有些長於詩文的畫家，尤其是文人畫，一畫完成之後，不特取了晝題，綴題些詩文來襯託晝意，於是後來有些買畫的，竟以題畫的多寡（包括別人所題），來定畫價的高低，甚至眞僞。因此一來，近年來的畫家爲了應付定畫的要求，且有在潤例內「長題加五」的列入了。</p>
<p>畫家並不是個個都可以創作畫題，因此：「歲寒三友」，「枯木竹石」，「山居談道」，「秋山紅樹」，「層巒蒼翠」，「聽松觀瀑」，「富貴吉羊」，「寒江獨釣」，「携琴訪友」，「白雲深處有僧歸」等，非常普遍。而所加題的詩詞，也多不是繪畫者因畫而新作，却是鈔襲的輾轉來用。爲了供求關係，投機書商且有輯述古今的題畫詩，分門別類，彙印成册，來供那些不能作詩的畫人，做按圖索驥的題畫枕中秘寳。</p>
<p>題畫固鍛要在輕靈中求貼切，不要執着而能夠和畫材調和，更要表示作者的身份，稱謂不要含有肉麻成分。曾見某畫人任職某機關，繪畫送他的長官，題款是：『×公尙書大人法家督畫，屬員×××敬繪，謹求賜政。』如此揹辭，等於上簽呈，離開藝術的範圍了。而且把民國的部長，當作滿淸的尙書，時代類倒，更爲可笑。又有畫人某，作就一張山水，竟題：『機聲梅店月，犬跡小橋霜』，別字連篇，該打手心。還有女畫家某寫折枝梅花，題了：『偶學雲林石法，遂慕與可新　。一片靑蔥氣色，居然兩　斜　』。梅花而用竹石題句，眞是牛頭不對馬嘴。無他，不求甚解，想着表示三絕淸才，遂致張冠李戴，故有此失。</p>
<p>仇十洲工畫而不工詩，他有自知之明，所作畫件，署款多是仇英製，或是仇英實父畫等的簡單款字，有時或加題年干而已。人各有能有不能，應該發揮自已的長處，而把短處隱藏起來，工晝的不必要工詩，猶之乎詩人不必要懂得作畫，只是詩已經能够獨立的文藝了。畫家如果不能够吟詠的，何必硬要再擠入詩人隊伍。要是不度德，不量力，勉强的凑成平仄，來題一首，非徒無益，而又害之罷了。</p>
<p>古人的題畫能手，多有高超意境，如石濤所題梅石水仙畫軸云：『兩君同姿同韻，放同時，而又宜水。雖江沙盆石，吟賞或殊，而一種淸芬遠韻，逈出塵凡，稱爲雙璧，何愧焉。今人於交遊，動言臭味，嘻，能如此飄然標映者，曾幾人！』這是借晝來談人生，意味雋永，而盡脫頭巾氣。金冬心題墨竹云：『予畫竹不畫石，石何難乎？顏色太古，雪作飛白者，乃佳。若攢苔用雨點皺，不屑畫也。畫竹宜疲，瘦多壽，自然飽風霜耳。蒙莊十圍臃腫之木，予覺懶對圖繪，恐客嘲　戲，以我爲食肉相也。」用風趣話說明畫竹石之理，絕非胸無點墨的所能效顰。</p>
<p>還有畫件請人題詩，也該考慮某人是否能够題畫，因爲有些雖然工於詩文的也不能够題畫，故此中應有斟酌選擇的必要。不然，好好的一張畫而題得不對，整張畫也爲之减色，且給觀者留着一個不良的印象，佛頭着糞，弄巧反拙。然而個中的微妙，很不容易的詳細來說，內行的一看便知。且因題晝的人與詩文，也可以知道繪畫的或藏畫的在文藝界的關係，同時也可以知他的本人對於文藝界取舍的高低，內行與外行，亦在此區分了。</p>
<p>題畫的年千，在我的見解，是應該採用民國紀元，纔是適合時代性，這一點，葉遐菴早已實行，是値得欽佩的。</p>
<h3>立體主義的繪畫</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>立體主義出現於二十世紀的繪畫史上，已經是二三十年以前的事了。所以立體主義也成爲一種古典，而今重新開始硏究它，實在也是一件挺有興趣的事。</p>
<p>這裏所要談的，是立體主義在現代畫史上，究竟有着怎樣的成果？同時把幾個居於立體主義指導地位的作家介紹一下。</p>
<p>一般認爲立體生義的起源，是保爾·塞尙（Paul　Cezanne）·這個見解自然是不怎麼錯的。然而這祇是立體主義發生上的一個原動力，決不能認爲是起源的。因爲立體主義並不僅是喬琪·白拉克（Braque）首先接受了塞尙理論所嘗試的一種繪畫上的實騐，而卞卡索（P．Picasso）才是其先覺的一個作家。也就是說卞卡索本身具有塞尙以外的要素的反證。他由於偶然研究黑人的雕刻，而發現一種造型的原理，並且應用黑人的造型的表現法；因此，說到立體主義的起源，一方面固然不能忽略它是受到塞尙作品的啟示，而另一方面是受到黑人藝術的影響甚大，這才較爲妥當。</p>
<p>在一九〇八年的時候，這種作品開始提出於巴黎現代美術展覽會，白拉克從塞尙出發的立體的表現出現了，而卞卡索學自黑人彫刻的立體的描寫亦被發表了。當時見了這種立體式樣的繪畫的馬諦斯（H．Matisse），曾經嘲笑着說：『立體畫！越玩越新奇了。』但不料從此立體主義運動的給畫就風靡了全巴黎，乃至全歐洲。</p>
<p>此後，他們往各地展覽，作爲立體派運動對於外國人的宣言。當時附於展覽會的出版物中的大批評家何波里耐序文裏，已被使用着所謂（Cubisme　et　Cubiste）的稱號。</p>
<p>新穎的立體主義運動，旣已集中了新時代的人們強烈的注意，同時也遭受到舊封建的老作家非常的壓迫。總之，使這立體主義運動成爲世界的繪晝的革命者，應該歸功於白拉克和卞卡索兩人的合作與努力。</p>
<p>這裏，試就最近白拉克的藝術作扼要的敍述，同時把立體主義在現代繪晝上的成果兼論一下：</p>
<p>立體主義從其出發當時的情形觀察，則其對象是向外界探求的，不過是將物象的形式變形化而已。即在接受塞尙主義及黑人藝術的感化時代的立體主義，曾經採用立體式的變形描法。然後隨着硏究的深入，雖在施行自然對象的分析，但漸漸脫離自然對象而向畫面本身覔求對象起來。這時已非處理自然產象的逼眞，而是將畫面本身作爲對象而被研九了。所以，我們稱之爲「畫面對象」。</p>
<p>這種態度，是把繪畫成爲最純粹的東西，繪畫應該從全部的書面出發，而與畫面的構成共始終。這方法，至少可說由白拉克所發現，並次第的使之純粹起來。因此，從塞尙主義爲出發的白拉克的立體表現，漸次脫離了最初的變形描法（Deformation），而進展到戲劇的塲面的構成（Formation）了。</p>
<p>一九三〇年以後的白拉克，可說是正在極度追究這種畫面上的構成。而這所謂繪畫上的構成問題已經成爲現代繪畫的一個中心問題。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　364</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「說罷！」我有些討厭他囉嗦了。</p>
<p>「那是剛才我路過『臨時辦公處』聽來的：聽說有人在查問『平明僧侶』，問他爲什麼不去劃到……」大傻子說到這裏，眼光已經移到鼎元身上了。</p>
<p>我有些莫明其妙，只見鼎元巳經站了起來，臉上掛着苦笑：「我得去轉轉再來，不去，怕他們渾蛋，也許要闖到這裏來。」說着便取了僧衣和那些零碎。</p>
<p>我這才知道鼎元在這裏取名「平明」，却是天天要去劃到，矮鬼簡直把他當作「半自由囚犯」看待，可見他處境的困苦危險。恐怕他自己還不知道哩。這時見他要走，因不知實際情形，也不便主張，忽然想到大傻子買來的食品，便立即打了手式，叫大傻子打開包裹。</p>
<p>『沒有關係，』鼎元知道我要他吃了再走，便對我說：『我那邊還有一份口糧，並且至多一小時就回來，有好吃的，給我留下一份……」說着，已經穿戴好了，對我們舉了舉手，拖着沉重的步子，一搖一晃，出門去了。</p>
<p>大傻子居然很能辦事，那包裹一拆開，內中除了食品之外，杯盤筷碟都有；食品裏面有兩隻大滷鷄，二三十隻高莊饅頭，許多滷蛋，一隻保暖瓶，想是盛的開永，還有一瓶酒，和幾隻上了年紀，縐了皮的生梨。</p>
<p>一邊吃着這春郊野餐式的午飯，一邊我把鶴見的故事結束了。對於鶴見被召回東京受訓的話，也未保留，昨晚收到的東京密訊，叫我們却準備赴　的話，也都說明。我又吿訴耀羣和小老虎，W君和我，自收到他們第一個報吿以來，異常焦灼，W君特地叫我趕到天津。及至收到第二次報吿，又叫我拋下天津正在着手的援救工作，往這裏趕；預備捨命偸渡南口「無人境地」，上張北去探索他們二人踪跡。天幸他們還在這裏逗遛着，天幸又碰了頭，可說一半人事，一半徼倖。我感到無上快樂，W君和東京得了剛才送去的電訊，當然放心了。</p>
<p>「都誤在電訊延遲上頭！」耀羣掉着眼淚，却掛着笑容：「就少了一個通訊工具，又沒有可靠的交通人手；凑巧……」耀羣說到這裏，又瞧了小老虎一眼；「虎弟又走散了，不然的話，……」</p>
<p>小老虎聽到這裏，整個身子震動了一下，好像忽然觸電模樣，我禁不住笑了起來。小老虎見我笑了，更形尷尬。我想到小老虎那兩個報吿，又想到他脾氣古怪，人到了北平，不知爲了什麼竟不肯上總部當面報吿，鬼鬼祟祟，弄了那封欹形「公文」，就此一溜烟跑到這裏。耀羣要是知道了這件事，不痛痛數說他一頓才怪呢。我想小老虎一定不願我把這個膿泡挑破，所以一笑了之。</p>

<h3>熱浪襲擊上海</h3>
<p>— 海風</p>
<p>七月廿七日上海的溫度，到達九十九度九。據中央氣象台的記錄，民國廿三年七月十二日，曾到達一百〇四度，所以這遠不是最熱的天氣。統計七三年來平均溫度，是九十四度八，九十九度九已經打破七十三年來平均滬度的最高紀錄。</p>
<p>上海這一週來，都在酷熱之中，熱浪始終未曾退却；雖然有過幾塲雷暴雨的洗刷，但濃度並未减低。</p>
<p>由七月廿三日到卅一日，上海的溫度的紀錄是：廿三日：九十八度五，廿四日：九十八度九，廿五日：九十六度四，廿六日：九十大度，廿七日：九十九度九，廿八日：九十九度，廿九日：九十九度八，卅日：九十三度，卅一日：九十八度八。</p>
<p>這九天溫度，相差最多不過五度，而平均溫度都在九十八度左右，可見上海已為熱浪所侵襲。</p>
<p>上海今年所以如此酷熱，據氣象台的報告，是：因爲北太平洋的潮濕熱空氣與中國西南部的乾燥然空氣籠罩下，雖然容易發生地方性的雷雨，但雨過天靑，熱浪不會减低，而且熱的時期也並不會太短。</p>
<p>前兩天，大家對於天氣具有另一種新希望，即颱風將沿江浙沿海登陸，預定七月卅一日或八月一日左右，上海將受到這股颱風的襲擊。如若經過颱風的洗刷，天氣可能凉爽多多，但氣象台即於卅日宣布，這股颱風已於卅日下午在合灣東北向日本南部移動，風率旣小且弱，每小時僅廿五至卅英里，因此這股颱風巳形成一種溫帶的風暴，到陸地後活動力即行消失。</p>
<p>換句話說，上海已不會再受到任何颱風的影響。</p>
<p>如若要對八月天氣下個判斷的話，那麼—：上海的天　將更加酷熱，而且一時不會凉爽。</p>

<h3>救治失眠</h3>
<p>— 東方荆</p>
<p>可還記得那失眠之夜，翻來覆去，難以入夢呢？也許你要後悔，不該在臨睡之前吃了一碗餛飩，或是懊惱白天不該打一個瞌睡；以致妨碍了正常的睡眠。</p>
<p>但是，你的想法錯了。芝加哥大學有位納桑尼爾，克萊曼教授，積二十五年研究睡眠問題之經騐，得知晚餐吃的多少，睡前的小食，或是日間的午覺，對於夜晚的睡眠，並沒有不良的影響。</p>
<p>克萊曼教授被譽爲全世界對於睡眠問題知道得最多的一個人，現年五十二歲，一頭黑髮，也是全世界唯一每日工作二十四小時的人，他睡到床上以後，他的研究工作也不停止，他的睡床上安置了一套敏感的紀錄儀器，把他睡眠時心臟的跳動，呼吸，腦波的活動，以及身體轉動的情形，全都記錄下來。</p>
<p>克萊曼教授二十五年來研究的成績，打破一般人對於睡眠的錯誤見解。</p>
<p>例如，普通人認爲每個人每天應該有八小時的睡眠。克萊曼教授研究的結果，得知每個人所需要的睡眠時間是各不相同的，有人得睡九小時，但也有人，睡五小時就是够了。</p>
<p>在克萊曼教授的賣騐中，他自己曾連續一百八十個鐘頭沒有睡覺，除了工作的效率减低之外，並沒布永久性的不良反應。</p>
<p>人在睡覺的時候，總是不斷地轉動翻身。這種轉動只有使人睡得更熟。有人當警吿說，不要靠左而睡，其實靠那面睡並沒有關係，因爲在一夜之間，你至少要轉動十幾次。</p>
<p>普通人都覺得睡覺之前不要吃東西。其實，經過多次試騐，睡覺前不論是吃三明治，或是喝牛奶，對於睡眠都沒有影響。至於說到喝咖啡，克萊曼教授有三個答案。第一，有很多人睡前喝咖啡，照樣可以睡得很好。第二，有一些人受了咖啡的刺激，睡得不很熟。第三種人，他們只是心裏想受到咖啡的刺激，而致不能入睡。他們所以這樣想，是因爲他們平時一再地聽見人們這樣地說。</p>
<p>睡眠是甚麼呢？克萊曼敎授的答覆很簡單。他說；「睡眠是每一個人的例行公事，隔二十四小時重覆一次。因爲人做不到一直醒着不睡。」</p>
<p>嬰兒醒過來僅僅是因爲他覺得太冷或太熱，或是尿布濕了，肚子餓了。一旦喂飽了。換過尿布他感覺到舒適之後，就又睡着了。漸漸地長大以後，養成白天工作遊戲，晚上睡覺的習慣。</p>
<p>對於救治失眠，並沒有一個人人適用的方法。有人在睡覺前需要一點運動，有人需要洗一個熱水澡，也有人需要唱片來催眠，還有人需要數數目或是背誦世界各國首都的名稱。你要看那一種方法對你有效，就採用那一種。但千萬不要吃安眠藥。</p>
<p>根據克萊曼教授的實朧，認寫要騰得香甜，最好每天晚上在一定的時間睡覺，不要常常遲平不定。同時睡覺之前，不要神情緊張。如果睡得不好，早一點上床去睡。因爲早睡的人，　比較　得久，睡得好。</p>
<h3>歐美——婚後禮俗</h3>
<p>— 東方蒙霧</p>
<p>歐美人士在結婚後之第二年同月同日，照例有發柬請客宴　，以誌慶賀之舉。如前英皇愛權華銀婚，曾傳誦一時。近數十年來，我國那些「月亮也是外國好」之輩，亦有羣起而倣行者。唯大多恐僅知其金婚銀婚兩種婚禮俗而已。其餘的或皆未聞。茲特將筆者所知錄刋以供「逐洋」之名流雅士一一倣效，不令再有「滄海遺珠」之憾也：</p>
<p>第一年爲「棉花」；</p>
<p>第二年爲「紙」；</p>
<p>第三年爲「皮革」；</p>
<p>第五年爲「木質」；</p>
<p>第七年爲「羊毛」；</p>
<p>第十年為「錫」；</p>
<p>第十二為「絲」或「　　布」；</p>
<p>第十五爲「水晶」；</p>
<p>第二十爲「瓷」；</p>
<p>第二十五年爲「　」；</p>
<p>第三十年爲「珠」；</p>
<p>第四十年為「寶石」；</p>
<p>第五十年為「金」；</p>
<p>第七十五年爲「金鋼石」。</p>
<p>此由棉花而水晶而金　石！—當取其婚後夫婦能永結同心，愈老愈堅愈久愈固之意耳。</p>

<p>看戲肇事（光緒二二盺十二月廿六日）</p>
<p>上月廿七日，金都大戲院門前，警察憲兵發生悞會，引起衝突，持槍相對，如臨大敵，五十年前，上海戲院中，亦曾發生兵勇滋事，與觀衆發生口角，以致毆打喪生等事。</p>
<p>「日來南市沙寗各船，均雇滬北梨園子弟，在南會館登合演戲，觀者人山人海，雖有巡防局派勇彈壓，仍不免有吵鬧情事。前日，正在鑼鼓喧天，有某冶坊中人，與某營勇丁，因爭奪地位口角。一言不合，互扭毆打。其時勇丁甚多，故冶坊中人，披靡敗北，大受損傷。旋令人回坊糾合六七十人，興師間罪，至會館外阻住去路，見人便毆，於是勇丁等力不能支，反受損傷，有四勇則身受重傷。旋有人至營中報吿，當由營官某命將受傷然勇，抬至源來冶坊中。紛紛擾擾，不知如何了結也。」</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>庸俗無聊的「桃花依舊笑春風」</p>
<p>「桃花依舊笑春風」企圖以喜劇的題材來表現靑年男女的自由戀愛與婚後的生活，可是在故事中出現的張平與杜莎菲，這一對男女主角，前者是浮燥無聊的靑年，後者亦不過是莫明其妙愛發脾氣的闊小姐。二個人被編導者不知所云的拉凑在一起，演出了這一個「喜劇」的故事。這個劇本是够庸俗無聊的。</p>
<p>陳娟娟第一次演這樣的戲，成績尙較差强人意。白雲的張平在影片上出現時，花領帶花西裝，飛機頭，十足的洋塲惡少，扭妮之態，令人作嘔。王班在戲裏無發揮機會。</p>
<p>導演對戲的處理，散漫而零亂。</p>
<p>喜劇片「香檳鴛鴦」</p>
<p>同樣是一部喜劇片，「香檳鴛鴦」有着它成功之處。全劇以一瓶香檳酒　聯整個的故事。中間自然也免不了插入一段戀愛故事，但是編劇者的技巧是可取的。他讓這一瓶香檳酒數度獲得而又復失，寫來絲絲入扣，風趣橫生。觀衆的性情始終隨着那瓶香檳酒而轉移，一直至香檳酒擲向了新下水的航空母艦，才輕鬆的獲得了滿足，這不能不說是這部戲的成功之處。</p>
<p>演員中，雷密倫與奧麗薇哈佛闌都有着極優秀而洗練的演技。</p>
<p>約翰福特的「血海飛雷」</p>
<p>約翰福特是好萊塢優秀導演之一也是觀衆所熟悉的人物，這部「血海飛雷」便是他的作品。內容描寫太平洋戰爭爆發後，在菲島的一小隊海軍巡邏艇隊的英勇抗戰故事。在的翰福特的處理下的許多精彩的海戰塲面，是極爲動人的。可惜中間略有幾小段較爲散漫，但我們依然可以　到導演者雄偉的魄力與組織的刻劃。</p>
<p>退役歸來的勞勃蒙高茂萊，在片中演一隊長，沉着而洗練的演技，依然是不减當年。約翰偉恩，戲重而稱職。</p>
<p>歌唱片「丁香山」</p>
<p>「丁香山」是歌王平克勞斯貝與桃樂珊拉摩初次合演的歌唱片，這裏編劇者安排了一個輕鬆而生動的故事，幾次雜要式的歌唱劇，小劇院後台的風光，一個不大討厭的三角戀愛，在在都是給觀衆帶來輕鬆與風趣，尤其結尾時那一塲台上台下打成一片的歌唱塲面，實在是很動人的。</p>
<p>作爲娛樂，那末這一張片子是可一以看的。桃樂珊拉摩的改變作風尙見稱職，而瑪嬌麗蘭諾的珍尤爲可愛。</p>
<p>尙可一看的「人音尤物」</p>
<p>這是一部由長篇小說改編的劇本，故事是極爲管通的，一個妒忌的丈夫，有着一個美麗的妻子，他謀殺了二個人，終於被另一個醫生揭破陰謀，以至葬身火窟。導演對全片的處理着重在心理的刻劃上，因此使整個戲的進行，極能把握住緊張的氣氛。</p>
<p>女主角海蒂拉瑪，以艷麗馳名影壇，戲尙見稱職，惟唸詞較差。此外保爾羅伽斯之成績，確在喬治勃倫之上。這是個好萊塢硬裏子演員。</p>
<p>此片攝影技術極佳。</p>
<p>「天堂之夜」與「一千零一夜」</p>
<p>這二部都是以西方神話的故事及富麗堂皇的彩色片炫耀於觀衆的。但是除了一些攝影技巧上的賣弄，其他實在也沒有什麼新花樣。而且那些五彩的顏色，也頗爲庸俗的。</p>
<p>以「一曲難忘」的男女主角分任「天堂之夜」與「一千零一夜」二片之主角，實在是一件極可惋惜的事。</p>
<p>其他</p>
<p>亞博與考斯坦羅的「福至心靈」是最近演出的滑稽片中較佳之作。此外賈姆斯傑克納的「大好老」與瓊海　，珍妮葛蘭恩主演的「靑春唱」都是重映的片子了。</p>

<h3>Discussion of Peace Treaty Issues with Japan: We Have Expressed Our Position to the US and Made Specific Suggestions Regarding Voting Procedures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] A State Department spokesman announced today that China has responded to the US proposal to "convene a phased consultative conference on a peace treaty with Japan," but the spokesman did not specify when the reply was delivered. He stated that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie had discussed the matter with US Ambassador to China, Stuart Leavenworth, and Chinese Ambassador to the US, Gu Weijun, had also studied the matter with US State Department officials. Reporters then inquired about the detailed contents of China's reply. The spokesman responded that China's attitude was well known and refused to elaborate. He continued, "Unfortunately, the reporters and I all have the impression that 'China will make a formal reply on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan.'" He stated that the State Department did not anticipate receiving a formal reply from China, or one more formal than what it had received. When asked why China's reply was informal, he replied that he believed the State Department had never made a formal proposal. The US proposal to convene the conference was discussed informally with the Chinese Ambassador to the US when the latter was at the State Department, just as the Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Areas Administration, Hilldreth, had spoken to other countries about the possibility of convening such a conference. The spokesman also announced that replies had been received from all ten invited countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st, United Press] US officials stated that the Chinese government, in its "informal" protest against the US proposal regarding voting procedures for the peace treaty with Japan, cited the US argument made when the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission was established. At that time, the US sought to have resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission passed by a two-thirds majority of the eleven nations, but with the additional provision that the resolution must also be approved by a majority of the four major powers on the Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo. This meant that the consent of three of the four major powers (China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union) was required for a resolution to be finally adopted. The US originally intended this as a way to eliminate the veto power of a single nation, but the US and other countries eventually yielded to the Soviet Union's insistence that a simple veto by any one of the major powers could nullify any resolution. When the US proposed the voting procedure for the peace conference with Japan, it stated that a resolution would become final with a two-thirds majority vote of the eleven nations, with no distinction between major and minor powers in voting. However, China's comments on the voting method were only "informal." The Chinese Embassy in the US has not submitted these views to the US State Department to make them official. Some sources suggest that China intends to gauge the opinions of US officials on this issue.</p>
<h3>Mr. Gui Yongqing's Broadcast: The Current Status of Our Navy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, General Gui Yongqing, broadcast to the nation from the Broadcasting Headquarters of the First Military Corps of the Ministry of National Defense at 7 p.m. on the 1st, on the topic of "The Current Status of the Chinese Navy." Gui first pointed out that the navy is an integral part of the national defense system, and then cited the Pacific naval battles during the recent World War to prove that a strong Chinese navy is essential to ensure lasting peace in the Pacific. Gui stated, "We sincerely hope for the growth of the new navy, and the allied nations, for the sake of maintaining world peace, are assisting in the construction of our new navy with extremely valuable enthusiasm. The internal and external situations demand this, which is indeed an excellent opportunity for our country to establish a navy."</p>
<p>Regarding the current state and facilities of the navy, Gui made a comprehensive report: (1) After strict rectification of naval administration, naval orders are now absolutely unified and implemented throughout all naval organizations, from Hainan Island and the Nansha Islands in the south to Huludao in the north. (2) Due to orders to tighten the military this spring, the naval personnel quota was limited to 32,000 men. Currently, due to the increase in naval vessels, it has been ordered to expand to 34,500 men. (3) After reorganization, the naval fleet now has the First and Second Coastal Defense Fleets, a River Defense Fleet, and a Transport Fleet, totaling four fleets, along with ten gunboat squadrons, stationed at various coastal and river defense bases, responsible for maintaining order. (4) Naval bases have been established with headquarters in Shanghai-Qingdao, Zuoying, and Yulin Port. Additionally, eleven patrol offices have been established within the military regions of each base headquarters and the Yangtze River Defense Zone, including Huludao, Dagu, Dinghai, Keelung, Magong, Xiamen, Huangpu, Haikou, Nanjing, Hukou, and Xikou. (5) Military supplies are independent, finances are open, and a supply system is established. Personnel of the Fourth Department of the Naval Headquarters are dispatched by the Ministry of National Defense, and military supply personnel of the fleet are dispatched by the Fourth Department of the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief. Financial affairs are completely transparent. All naval operations are aimed at enabling the fleet to operate freely. Therefore, five main supply stations have been established within the main bases, and supply substations have been established in the tactical bases of each patrol office for centralized and distributed supply. (6) Consolidation and expansion of the ship repair and manufacturing capacity. Naval construction is primarily based on shipbuilding capacity and the development of light and heavy industries. Currently, there are naval shipyards in Shanghai-Qingdao, Zuoying, Yulin, Magong, Huangpu, and Dagu. Each patrol office has naval factories responsible for the repair and maintenance of existing naval vessels. (7) Unified naval training. Naval officer training is now concentrated at the Qingdao Naval Academy, while soldier training is concentrated at the Naval Petty Officer School. In addition, specialized training in shipbuilding, engine manufacturing, ordnance manufacturing, and electrical engineering is concentrated at the Naval Mechanical School. Regarding enrollment, a quota system based on the population of each province is adopted to avoid repeating factionalism.</p>
<p>Gui also mentioned the improvement of the naval communications network, the establishment of personnel systems, the compilation of regulations, the review of pacification work, and the reception of Japanese and American ships. In conclusion, Gui specifically pointed out that the primary problem encountered in naval construction is the cultivation of technical personnel and cadres. The Naval Headquarters has ordered all naval personnel throughout the country to return to military service. Starting this year, the Central Naval Academy will recruit students nationwide based on provincial quotas. Secondly, naval construction requires advanced industry and sophisticated scientific knowledge and cannot be achieved overnight. Gui also pointed out that China's coastline is approximately 10,000 kilometers, extending from the mouth of the Yalu River in the north to the Beilun River estuary in Guangdong in the south, spanning the territorial waters of seven provinces. To the south are the Nansha and Xisha Islands, and to the east are the Penghu and Taiwan Islands. There are approximately 3,400 islands of varying sizes along the coast, covering an area of over 40,000 square kilometers. Half of the coastline is completely exposed to the ocean. Without strong coastal defense, China will be threatened.</p>
<h3>Mobil Oil Executive, Mr. Mitter, Appeals for Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 1st] Mobil Oil Company's China branch executive, Mr. Mitter, spoke at the Far East Problems Conference today, stating that financial and technical assistance to China's commercial recovery is an urgent need in the East. It is said that if China's industry and commerce can regain freedom, the country can be stabilized. China's taking over the leadership position lost by Japan in the Far East is beneficial to the entire world. China has the resources and intelligence to become self-sufficient, but it needs assistance at this time.</p>

<h3>The Four Powers' Allocation of Japanese Warships: Unrelated to Reparations Claims; Shang Zhen Cables That It Is Handled as a Special Case</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] According to naval sources, the allocation of Japanese warships by lottery among the four countries (China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union) in Tokyo is a special case and is unrelated to the issue of Japanese reparations to the Allied nations. The head of our delegation to Japan, Shang Zhen, also sent a cable to the Naval Headquarters stating, "The allocation of warships by various countries is a special case and is unrelated to reparations claims. If there are any misrepresentations in domestic newspapers, it is hoped that they will be corrected."</p>
<h3>Envoy Wei Visits Leaders in Beiping, Expresses US Willingness to Help China Achieve Prosperity and Strength; Mission Scheduled to Depart for Tianjin Tomorrow and Transfer to Shenyang for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Wedemeyer, accompanied by Captain Wu Hanmin, visited the military and political leaders of Beiping on the morning of the 2nd. At 9:30 a.m., he went to Jurenhall to visit Li Zongren, who personally greeted him at the gate and escorted him inside for a cordial conversation lasting one hour. Li gave a concise explanation of the situation in North China. At 10:30 a.m., he departed for the Baoding Pacification Headquarters and the Beiping Command Post on Tieshizi Hutong to visit Deputy Director Sun Lianzhong, with Chen Jicheng also present. Wedemeyer had met Sun in Chongqing when he served as Chief of Staff of the China Theater. They were delighted to meet again after a long separation. In addition to expressing his special welcome from Baoding, Sun also explained the work of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters. Wedemeyer departed at 11:20 a.m. to visit He Siyuan at the Municipal Government, with Deputy Mayor Zhang Bojin also present. Upon learning that He had studied in Germany, Wedemeyer switched to fluent German and conversed with He. During the conversation, he stated: (1) The US has no demands on China, but only hopes that China will become a prosperous and strong country, becoming a stabilizing force in East Asia. Under this principle, the US is willing to provide China with friendship and assistance. At this point, Wedemeyer regretted that after the US donated materials from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to several European countries, the "USA" logo was often painted over. He replied, "Please check if this is happening in China," and they both laughed. (2) Wedemeyer hopes that China will embark on the path of democracy, especially hoping that social elites and intellectuals will enthusiastically participate in politics. (3) Wedemeyer stated that he loves Beiping very much, that his mother had lived in Beiping for a long time, and that Beiping's terrain, climate, and all conditions are suitable as a capital. He said that Beiping's urban plan is still being designed according to national needs, but this has not been instructed by the central government. At 12:10 p.m., Wedemeyer returned to the consulate. Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, and He Siyuan originally planned to host separate banquets to welcome him. Now, in order to reduce Wedemeyer's social engagements, Li Zongren decided to host a solo banquet for Wedemeyer at 8 p.m. tomorrow, inviting Sun Lianzhong, He Siyuan, Chen Jicheng, Hu Shi, Mei Yi-chi, and others to accompany him.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Beiping, 2nd] General Wedemeyer received the leader of the American Church, Pastor White, acting president of Yenching University, Adolf, President of Tsinghua University, Dr. Mei Yi-chi, President of Catholic University, Dr. Hu Shi, and three members of the Democratic Socialist Party this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Wedemeyer spoke with Mr. Mei Yi-chi today from 4:10 p.m. for half an hour. Wedemeyer said that the US is very willing to help China, but how should it help? Mei replied, "American help is indispensable to China. Without American aid, China will feel more and greater difficulties. I hope that the United States can help improve people's lives and help China engage in construction." Wedemeyer mentioned the "Dongdan" and "Shen Chong" incidents, saying that rape cases occur in China and foreign countries, and it is not uncommon for them to occur in the military. Why did this cause such a big storm? Before meeting Mei, Wedemeyer had a conversation with the acting president of Yenching University, Lu Zhijing, for one and a half hours. Lu told reporters after departing that he had generally discussed Sino-US relations with Envoy Wei. He expressed what the Chinese people hope for in the development of US policy and what should not be done.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Liang Qiushui of the Democratic Socialist Party Innovation faction told reporters after departing from Envoy Wei's residence that he had said what others dared not say, and had pleaded for the poor who could not survive under corruption and war. Wedemeyer expressed sympathy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] From 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on the evening of the 2nd, US Consul General Freeman held a cocktail party for Envoy Wei. High-ranking military and political officials, as well as cultural, educational, and social celebrities, were invited. Also, today, an elderly man of 65, Xie Daoan, requested to meet with Envoy Wei but was rejected. It is known that this old man had requested to see President Chiang and Marshall when they came to Beiping, but was rejected. Wedemeyer's economic advisor, Walker, also began an investigation today. At 2:20 p.m. in the afternoon, he met with Ma Shiliang, director of the Beiping office of the Resources Committee, Bao Guobin, general manager of the Hebei Electric Power Company, Chen Dashou, general manager of the North China Iron and Steel Company, and Lu Zongxian, general manager of the North China Cement Company. Ma and the other four brought written materials and explained the unstarted industrial and mining situation in North China. It is known that Walker paid particular attention to heavy industry in North China. In addition, General Wedemeyer's mission held brief meetings with American personnel from the US consulate all day. Each member of the mission discussed various special issues individually.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd] Wedemeyer is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on the morning of the 4th and fly to Shenyang at 5 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th. All parties in Tianjin have widely collected information to provide it to Envoy Wei for reference. Important figures in industry and commerce are also preparing to visit Wedemeyer. The Tianjin Municipal Government will host a frugal meal of four dishes and one soup, which is being promoted, to welcome the special envoy.</p>
<p>People Send Letters to the US Consulate Expressing Hopes for Friendly Nations</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] The US Consulate here received a large number of letters from the people of North China today, all wanting to tell General Wedemeyer how the United States should act toward China. US Consul Freeman has also been extremely busy this week, meeting with people from all walks of life, taking the same views. According to US Consul's talk with people about Miss Willis, the British missionary, hopes that Wedemeyer will make a broadcast to the CCP area to urge them to lay down their arms and stop all kinds of pranks. I am afraid that Wedemeyer cannot use his reserved broadcasting time for this speech.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the US Consul in Changchun, Kreps, flew from the Northeast to here last week to prepare to report on the situation in the Northeast to Envoy Wei.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 2nd] Yu Bin and Pan Chaoying will come to Shenyang before Wedemeyer. Also, Mo Dehui, a member of the government committee, will also come to Shenyang in the short term. Zi and others are helping to collect data at Wedemeyer's invitation.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 2nd] It is reported that Wedemeyer and his party of eleven may come to Hankou on the 18th to collect Wuhan industrial and commercial data. The Hankou Municipal Government and relevant agencies are now preparing to respond.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The four representatives of the Democratic League in Beijing have all returned to Shanghai on the 1st. According to Ji and others, reporters said that they had visited Envoy Wei in Beijing and exchanged views on the situation, but did not submit any documents. The former mission had hoped that the Democratic League could provide some information, so they had prepared for it, but for caution, they will hold a meeting in the next few days to discuss it again. The representatives are very silent about their views on Wedemeyer's mission, saying that everyone has their own views and is unwilling to publish them. However, they believe that the rumor that the government will be reorganized again will not be realized in the short term. Also, the Democratic League will convene a regular meeting in one or two days to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Pacification Headquarters Proposes Plan to Establish Border Area Pacification Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] It is learned that 26 counties, including 19 counties such as Yan'an in northern Shaanxi, 6 counties such as Qingyang in Gansu, and Chi in Ningxia, are located at the intersection of the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi, and Suiyuan. Because they have been occupied by the Communist bandits for many years, the administrative regions have been divided. In order to strengthen administration in conjunction with military affairs to facilitate governance, the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters has specifically proposed a plan to establish a Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Area Pacification Headquarters in Yan'an to manage all military, political, party, and group affairs. It is requested that all expenses in the listed areas be borne by the central government for one year. At the same time, it is also requested that the central government bear the administrative expenses for the recovered areas in northern Shaanxi for one year. After the two cases were submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and National Defense jointly reviewed them and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for decision. In terms of organization, the Pacification Headquarters will be changed to the Shaanxi Northern Administrative Office, and the Gansu Provincial Government will strengthen the organization of the Longdong Supervisory District, which has been approved by the Chairman. As for the funding part, the subsidy standards for the recovered counties in the pacification area will be adjusted and increased appropriately. The Executive Yuan then doubled the subsidy fees and emergency relief funds for the recovered counties in the pacification area. However, at the administrative symposium, Chairman Zhu proposed to maintain the original plan, which is that the central government should bear the administrative expenses of 7.145 billion yuan per month for each level of administration in northern Shaanxi for one year. The Budget Review Committee of the Executive Yuan discussed the case in detail at its meeting on the 2nd, which took a long time and has not yet reached a final conclusion.</p>
<h3>Food Department Business Review Meeting Discusses Proposals from Various Units</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Food Department held a business review symposium all day on the 2nd. More than 30 directors of various departments of the department and directors of the Food Bureaus of various provinces attended the meeting, which was chaired by Minister Yu Feipeng. From 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the morning and from 3:00 p.m. to 6:10 p.m. in the afternoon, all the questions raised by the various units have been fully discussed. The program is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Questions raised by the Field Tax Office (1) Levy issues, (2) Institutional issues, (3) Tax registration issues (including tax registration consolidation issues and tax registration maintenance issues).</p>
<p>(B) Questions raised by the Food and Funds Verification Committee of various provinces, (1) It is hoped that the settlement report will be processed no later than before the new tax levy, (2) Verification expenses, except for those that have been approved, cannot be increased. (3) On the issue of recovering old debts, (4) On promotional matters.</p>
<p>(C) Questions raised by the Preparation Division (1) The amount of grain accumulated in various provinces in 1947, (2) The preparation and modification of grain collection warehouses, (3) The timely reporting of the amount of grain collected, allocated, and stored.</p>
<p>(D) Questions raised by the Allocation Division (1) Reiterate the precautions for the allocation of military power in the Field Tax Business Review Meeting on May 1 of this year, (2) Adjustment of grain transportation prices in 1947.</p>
<p>(E) Questions raised by the Finance Division (1) The allocation of funds for the purchase of military grain in various provinces in August and September of this year, (2) The case of grain bonds in various provinces in 1931 and 1932, which are due for principal and interest in each year (the case of Hena Province's 1931 treasury bonds not being distributed, and how to pay the principal and interest due in each year from 1933 to 1936, and the case where the field tax in various provinces was exempted or partially exempted after the victory, and all the principal and interest of the treasury bonds due in that year were ordered to be deferred for one year, and how should the treasury bonds to be repaid this year be calculated).</p>
<p>(F) Questions raised by the Accounting Office (1) Regarding institutional expenses, (2) Regarding the settlement of grain accounts and grain funds.</p>
<p>(G) Questions raised by the Control Division Regarding the free flow of controlled rice, wheat, and flour. The free flow of food is of great importance to regulating surpluses and deficiencies, especially rice, wheat, flour, and other grains, which are the main food for the people. How should various provinces make them flow freely and mutually balance surpluses and deficiencies? Those in the producing areas should be transported to the sales areas, and they must not seek local stability, attempt to protect themselves, and close customs and prohibit transportation without authorization.</p>

<h3>Mr. Xu Shiying Talks to Our Reporter: Mongolia and Tibet are Generally Peaceful; The Xigong Banner Incident Will Be Handled Quickly and Carefully</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, met with our reporter on the 2nd and stated: Since taking office two months ago, although one or two minor incidents have occurred in Mongolia and Tibet, the overall situation remains peaceful. The religious and political strife in Tibet is a thing of the past, and the dependents of Reting have been generously compensated. Many newspaper reports regarding military affairs are mostly based on conjecture and are simply old news being presented as new. As for the murder of Queen Qijunfeng of the Xigong Banner in Suimeng and her young son, it is not a particularly serious incident and can be handled based on the principle of emphasizing both the law and the facts. The Queen's family will receive generous compensation, and the guilty subordinates will be punished. Furthermore, the political and personnel affairs of the Xigong Banner will certainly undergo an adjustment that will satisfy the banner's soldiers and civilians. Xu said: Political disputes within Mongolia and Tibet are common occurrences. The murders of Reting and Qijunfeng are sharp manifestations of these disputes. The central government's attitude towards the political affairs of border compatriots has always been lenient and fair, and it will continue to adhere to this principle in the future, actively preventing problems before they arise, so as to avoid the unfortunate recurrence of bloodshed. As for the point that political disputes among border compatriots could affect the defense of the borders, it is indeed a matter that should be given attention. However, as transportation between the interior and the border areas becomes increasingly convenient and misunderstandings between the two sides decrease, from the perspective of our policy of governing the border areas, it does not seem necessary to worry prematurely. Mr. Xu was in high spirits, and after a lengthy and patient conversation, he instructed his subordinates to send another telegram to the Sui Provincial Government, the Mongolian Political Council, and He Xianlin, the director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's office in Peiping (currently in Suiyuan), urging them to handle the Xigong Banner incident quickly and carefully.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guisui, 2nd] Chairman Dong sent Ba Jingyuan, the head of the Mongolian Banner Welfare Committee, to the Xigong Banner to investigate the murder case of Qijunfeng and her son. He returned to Guisui on the 1st to report his findings. According to him, the Xigong Banner is currently as peaceful as ever, and the bodies of Qijunfeng and her son have been placed in coffins and are lying in state at the public temple. The Sui Provincial Government's handling of this matter seems to focus on stabilizing the local order of the banner, and the handling methods have not yet been announced. Key officials will be sent to the Xigong Banner again within days. Prince Ba, the head of the Ulanqab League, expressed that the incident in the Xigong Banner should be handled with care. Prince Ba is old and has difficulty moving around, so his son, Prince Lin of the Zhonggong Banner, will come to Guisui within days to pay respects to Chairman Dong, convey Prince Ba's views on the handling of the Xigong Banner incident, and provide them to the Sui Provincial Government for reference (Prince Ba's full name is Ba Shiduorji, and Prince Lin's is Linqinsengge). (Please see page 5 for the details of the murder of Qijunfeng and her son.)</p>

<h3>Rampant Gold Black Market in Macau; Philippine Government Forbids the Continued Transport of Gold</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 2nd] Philippine Finance Minister Cuaderno announced today that there is an international gold black market in Macau, involving gold bars and Mexican gold coins worth millions of dollars. Chinese merchants, fearing the devaluation of legal tender, are willing to pay high premiums to buy gold. Although the International Monetary Fund has stipulated that the price of gold is US$35 per ounce, the market price in Macau has reached at least US$51 per ounce. This high premium has led to a large influx of gold into Macau, where Chinese merchants can freely buy gold without fear of it being confiscated by the National Government. The Philippine government has now cooperated with the International Monetary Fund to ban the transport of gold to Macau and other places where the black market is rampant. The Ministry of Finance refused to approve multiple applications for exports to Macau last week, worth more than 5 million pesos, or about 2.5 million US dollars. The amount of gold exports to China has increased sharply since the continuous fluctuations in the value of the Chinese currency in February of this year, which has attracted the attention of the Philippine government.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Supervisory Committee members Yu Shude, Wang Xuan, and 43 others recently submitted a "Proposal to the National Government on Reforming Politics and Urgent Matters to be Implemented, Consisting of Sixteen Points for Adoption."

It suggests establishing a military officer disciplinary committee as soon as possible, and hopes that the disciplinary cases previously submitted by the Supervisory Yuan will not be shelved. For the takeover and investigation matters, it is hoped that those who have been found guilty will be brought to justice as soon as possible. The proposal also mentioned the gold case that has attracted attention from all parties, hoping that the authorities will severely punish the main culprits in the case. Second, it mentions strictly practicing thrift and strictly prohibiting extravagance. The main points of this item include continuing to implement the wartime thrift measures, strictly prohibiting the import of luxury goods, etc. Other key points in the political part include implementing the separation of military and civilian affairs, local officials not being appointed by military personnel, strictly prohibiting concurrent positions, strictly implementing one person, one position, dividing powers and responsibilities, abolishing special local systems, reducing and merging redundant institutions, improving and unifying the treatment of public and education personnel, so that the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises does not exceed that of other personnel, and strictly prohibiting disguised increases in treatment under the guise of employee welfare. The economic part is divided into three major categories, including tightening fiscal expenditures, thoroughly investigating the use of foreign exchange and punishing those who waste it, saving loans, improving the tax system, preventing the widening gap between the rich and the poor, cracking down on bureaucratic capitalism, and strictly supervising financial enterprises.</p>
<h3>Administrative Symposium Successfully Concluded: Strengthening Central-Local Communication</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] After the grain conference, the Executive Yuan convened four administrative symposia for the chairmen of various provinces in Nanjing, two of which (July 31st and August 1st) were held from 9:00 PM to around 1:00 AM. According to inquiries from the Executive Yuan and several provincial chairmen, the main spirit of these four meetings was to gather the provincial chairmen and the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the central government together. The provincial chairmen took this opportunity to report to the central government on the problems and difficulties encountered locally, as well as their requests to the central government. The Executive Yuan was able to fully listen to the facts and opinions presented by the provincial chairmen, examine, analyze, and instruct them, and put forward the central government's hopes for the local governments, so that the central and local governments could understand each other and jointly plan the way to implement national policies. Before each symposium, the provincial chairmen held preparatory meetings to exchange views and elected Chairman Shen Honglie as the representative in the symposium to speak on their behalf in a concentrated manner. The Executive Yuan side responded separately through the heads of the relevant ministries and commissions. President Zhang also gave instructions at any time. As a result of the discussions, some issues have been specifically decided, some issues have only been decided in principle, and for issues that could not be resolved immediately, the central government will consider and study them. The focus of the discussion was nothing more than the following items: (1) During the constitutional preparation period, the coordination of politics in various provinces with constitutional government. (2) The mobilization of local human, financial, and material resources and the coordination of all economic and political construction with military affairs during the general mobilization period. (3) Ensuring local public order, and rationally adjusting local institutions and finances. In the last symposium on August 1st, President Zhang also gave general instructions to the chairmen of various provinces.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] The overall victory situation in Shandong Province has been established. Now, with complete preparations, troops are advancing in multiple directions, and the communist army on the south bank of the Yellow River can be completely resolved in the near future. In recent days, the 1st and 4th columns of the communist bandits were encircled and suppressed by the national army's land and air forces in the Jinjiazhuang area west of Teng County, and most of them were annihilated. The remnants crossed the Si River eastward and fled northward.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] The remaining troops of Liu Bocheng, four and a half columns and one independent brigade, in Tangjiakou, Dayi Gathering, Songshan Gathering, Huotian Gathering, and other places north of Jixiang City, have partly fled north to the area north of Juye and Jiaxiang. The bandits believe that it is impossible to cross the Yellow River northward due to the rising river water in recent days. In addition, Dongkou and Linpu Gatherings have been recaptured by the national army on the night of the 1st, cutting off the bandits' retreat route. Therefore, this bandit army is already in a state of panic and it will not be difficult to completely annihilate them. Chen Yi's two columns and one division, totaling about 70,000 people, who had fled to Guoliji, Daxiaohucun, and Jinjiazhuang on the east bank of Dushan Lake, broke through and fled north to the area between Wenshang and Shenyang after being encircled and suppressed by the national army for days. After merging with the remnants of the two columns who had originally fled there, they appeared to be continuing to flee northward across the Wen River. The national army is continuing to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] The Battle of Linqu has come to an end. The national army is continuing to pursue the bandits retreating towards Yidu Zhu and Liushanzhai and Fengyu in the southeast of the city. The rumors of bandits counterattacking are not accurate. In addition, the bandits in Yangshan Gathering, Dayi Gathering, and other places in southwestern Shandong are fleeing to the area north of Juye, and the national army is pursuing them. The Linqu situation has achieved results. According to preliminary investigations, more than 2,000 rifles, more than 200 light and heavy machine guns, and 10 artillery pieces have been seized. More than 3,000 prisoners of war and surrendered bandits have been captured. Other war trophies are still being inventoried. All sectors of Shandong Province have recently launched a fundraising campaign of 1 billion yuan to comfort the soldiers who defended the city of Linqu.</p>

In addition, the remnants of the 1st and 4th columns and the 13th division of the 5th column of the communist bandits who fled to the area near Guoliji were encircled and suppressed by the national army for days and fled in panic northward. The national army occupied Guoliji on the 1st and captured countless prisoners of war. In particular, the number of weapons seized was large because the bandit army suffered heavy casualties and fled without being able to carry them away, leaving them in Guoliji, which are currently being inventoried. The remnants of the bandits are now gathered in Sunjiadian (in the area between Jining and Ziyang), hoping to get a temporary respite. The national army is intensifying its encirclement and suppression.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2nd] The communist bandits' East China Field Army in Shandong Province has suffered a disastrous defeat in the past month, and its main force has been almost completely lost.

<h3>Xikang Province Consolidates Land Taxes: Uncovers Land Gentry Arrears</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ya'an, 1st] In order to reduce the burden on the people, the Xikang provincial authorities specially ordered each county to thoroughly consolidate land tax quotas. The consolidation results show that since there has never been a general household registration, the general grain people pay by means of name designation, and there are relatively few who pay taxes above ten yuan. It was also found that these grain people are all local powerful land gentry, and most of them have not paid even a single grain over the years. The general people who pay less than ten yuan have all paid without omission. The so-called "leaked or abused grain quota" is the amount not paid by these land gentry. The Xikang provincial authorities pay special attention to this and will thoroughly handle it to enrich the national tax.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Returning Home with Foreign Currency - No Limit on Amount - Should be Exchanged for National Currency on Day of Entry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding whether there are any restrictions on the amount of foreign currency notes that overseas Chinese compatriots bring back to the country, and what the procedures are for exchanging them into national currency, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission requested an interpretation from the Ministry of Finance. According to the Ministry of Finance's reply: The "Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency Notes" only stipulate that Chinese and foreign people entering the country should declare and register the foreign currency notes they carry with them to the Customs. On the day of entry, they should exchange them for national currency at the official exchange rate at the local Central Bank or other entrusted places. Those who conceal them will have them confiscated. There is no limit to the amount of foreign currency brought in for exchange into national currency. However, at present, the Central Bank has not yet established exchange rates for currencies other than U.S. dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars, and cannot accept them for exchange. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is still in negotiations. Before a result is obtained, it is hoped that our returning overseas Chinese compatriots will not bring back foreign currencies that cannot be exchanged.</p>
<h3>Wen Yuanning to Go to Nanjing Soon - To Discuss Personnel for Embassy in Greece</h3>
<p>It is said that there is only one overseas Chinese in Greece</p>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] A reporter visited Mr. Wen Yuanning, our country's newly appointed ambassador to Greece, yesterday to inquire about everything. Mr. Wen stated that the date of his departure has not yet been determined, and he is scheduled to go to Nanjing soon to discuss the personnel arrangements for the embassy and the establishment of consulates. There is practically no overseas Chinese affairs in Greece, as there is only one overseas Chinese person there (from Ningbo), but Greece is particularly important in terms of politics and diplomacy. Mr. Wen also stated that after taking office, he will work hard in three areas: (1) to increase the understanding of Greece by all sectors of our country, (2) to strengthen Sino-Greek cooperation, and (3) to promote cultural exchange between China and Greece, as both Greece and our country are the birthplaces of world culture. The situation in Greece is currently stable, with only localized conflicts in the north. Due to Greece's importance in politics and military strategy, British and American aid to Greece will increase rather than decrease, and the various developments in the Greek situation will also have an indirect impact on the situation in the East.</p>

<h3>U.S. Military Commits Assault in Nanjing at Midnight - Two of Our Soldiers Thrown into Water and Drowned - U.S. Advisory Group Says Suspects Detained</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch, Nanjing, 2nd] At half past midnight on the 2nd, an international tragedy occurred on the Zhonghe Bridge outside Guanghua Gate in Nanjing. Wang Shouben, a driver from our Air Transport Brigade, and Ge Fating, a nurse from the Fifth Air Force Brigade, were "dragged" by two of the four U.S. soldiers driving past while they were relaxing, thrown into the moat, and tragically drowned. According to Tu Zhonghai, an eyewitness who narrowly escaped with his life, the perpetrators laughed wildly after committing the crime and calmly drove away in a jeep. After receiving the report, the Capital Police Department immediately ordered people to retrieve the bodies and sent personnel to investigate the details overnight. The U.S. military police also sent personnel to the scene to investigate. The police department also notified the U.S. Military Advisory Group and the U.S. Military Police in the morning to assist our foreign affairs police officers in investigating the perpetrators. The four U.S. soldiers who committed the crime had driven to the gate of the Air Force Base at Dajiaochang before committing the crime and spoke with the Chinese and U.S. military police guarding the gate. Whether this case was "drunken rowdiness" cannot be determined at this time. The U.S. Military Advisory Group announced this afternoon that two U.S. soldiers, Sergeant Savani and Corporal Adorei, who are suspected, were detained this afternoon and will be interrogated soon. According to the Capital Police Department, everything will be resolved in accordance with international law, and it is hoped that all parties will remain calm.</p>
<h3>Officialdom's "Conservatism" - Hindering the Development of the U.S. Air Force - Content of Chennault's Speech That Was Banned from Broadcasting</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] Yesterday was U.S. Air Force Day. The Nanjing U.S. military radio station had previously invited Chennault, the former commander of the Fourteenth Air Force, to deliver a speech. The speech criticized the current policies of the U.S. military. General Rooks, the head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, considered the content of the speech to be inappropriate and ordered the U.S. military radio station to stop broadcasting it. A reporter from the English-language *China Evening News* recently learned the content of the speech from relevant sources. The main points are excerpted and translated as follows:</p>
<p>"I believe that the strength of the U.S. Air Force must be maintained and developed to permanently guarantee that the U.S. doctrine survives in our world. I do not want to make a sensational speech, but I would like to use simple words to point out to the people of the country one of the greatest dangers in the path of developing our country's air force strength. I have seen this danger for a long time, but I have not had a suitable name for it. Let me call it officialdom's conservatism. That is, the conservatism of those politicians at desks and in congress in Washington. These people are short-sighted, saving small amounts of money but suffering great losses, preferring to waste countless sums of money in wartime rather than making limited investments in peacetime to maintain technological progress. The United States cannot allow the technological development of the air force to be too disconnected from the actual application of national defense. We can no longer ignore such new technological developments, as we have done in the past. These are my personal thoughts and hopes for U.S. Air Force Day."</p>

<h3>Macao Police Commit Assault - Beat Cyclist to Death - Enraging Public to Surround Barrier Gate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Macao, 1st] At 11:00 AM on the 29th, cyclist Li Wenbin, driving from Shiqi (under the jurisdiction of Zhongshan County) to Macao, was accused by Macao police at the Macao border barrier gate of violating regulations and refusing inspection, and was beaten. Zhu was injured and fell to the ground, and was sent to the hospital for treatment. He died en route due to serious injuries. Upon hearing the news, our people were extremely angry and surrounded the barrier gate, preventing goods from entering and leaving. Order was restored after our Standing Bureau persuaded them. After the incident, Macao Police Chief Sa Gapang expressed deep regret and requested that our side send doctors to jointly examine the cause of death and resolve it according to law. Zhu's body was dissected by a prosecutor from the World Court and doctors, who proved that the death was indeed caused by a ruptured spleen due to injury. The perpetrator, police officer Sousa, is currently being detained by the police station and will be severely punished according to law. Compensation will also be given to the family of the deceased. The Macao border barrier gate has been unblocked and traffic has returned to normal.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the Central News Agency's New York dispatch on the 1st, which stated that the *U.S. Commerce Daily* was surprised that our semi-official announcement that this year's cotton production could reach 11 million bales was weak, Mr. Sun Enlin, director of the Cotton Production Improvement Office, stated that the expected increase in cotton production in our country this year is 12.5 million dan. According to the international metric system, each bale is equal to 500 pounds, which should be about 2.755 million bales. The reported number of 11 million bales should be a mistake for 11 million dan.</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum: Several Economic Issues of the Treaty of Peace with Japan</h3>
<p>— Ding Zhijin</p>
<p>Two years have passed since the end of the war, but the peace treaty has not yet been signed. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of international wars. However, most countries do not want to sign the treaty of peace as soon as possible. Especially the United States, which hopes to conclude the treaty of peace as soon as possible, is the most urgent. Because after the treaty of peace is signed, not only can the troops stationed in the defeated country be withdrawn, but also trade with the defeated country can be restored, which is enough to reduce the burden on taxpayers. Recently, the United States issued a notice inviting eleven countries in the Far East to hold a preliminary meeting on the treaty of peace with Japan on August 19. This is based on this motive.</p>
<p>The highest purpose of the treaty of peace with Japan is to prevent Japan from launching aggression again. To achieve this goal, of course, efforts must be made in military, political, economic, cultural and educational aspects. But as human civilization has developed to this stage, we believe that the economy is the most fundamental and realistic aspect. Fifty years ago, the teachers in Japanese schools were asking: "Where are the best peaches produced?" The students were answering: "The best peaches are produced in China!" The most fundamental motive for Japan's deliberate launch of aggression against China was to seize China's rich resources. As the technology and scale of warfare have developed today, economics has undoubtedly become the decisive factor. Japan was able to launch the war of aggression against China entirely because of its industrial superiority. And it is undeniable that the United Nations was able to win the final victory because of the vast productivity of the United States. Future wars are entirely "wars of production" and "wars of economic power." Therefore, in the treaty of peace with Japan, the economic part is something that all countries must fight for, especially our country, which must not allow even a trace of negligence.</p>
<p>Here, we put forward several principles to examine:</p>
<p>First, Japan's industry must never be allowed to switch to wartime industry. In the world, only the Soviet Union's several five-year plans have used the blood and sweat of most of the people to build a huge military industry. Other countries rarely produce munitions with all their strength in peacetime. Japan will not boldly produce munitions with all its strength when the treaty of peace is first signed. But the Japanese people are a nation that can endure humiliation and has conspiracies and strategies. They will use various pretexts to establish and expand many industries. Once something happens, they can immediately switch to munitions industries. In today's environment where the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly acute, the United States may condone Japan. But in China's view, this is tantamount to burying the results of the eight-year war of resistance. It is too dangerous for China. We must actively prevent the development in this direction in the treaty of peace, so that Japan's industry will not be allowed to transform into a wartime industry at any time in the future.</p>
<p>Second, Japan's economy must not be allowed to turn into a wartime economy. A country has a peacetime economic system in peacetime and a wartime economic system in wartime. The most important point of the wartime economic system is self-sufficiency. Food must be self-sufficient, and the raw materials, labor, and even machines for the munitions industry and the necessary civil industries must be self-sufficient. The best way is to establish a scale of industry and agriculture in peacetime that can stop imports at any time, and its own production is sufficient to meet the needs of all aspects during wartime. The second is to accumulate a large amount in peacetime for wartime use. In these two ways, neither of them should be allowed to be used by defeated Japan.</p>
<p>Third, Japan's future economic development should not conflict with our country's economic development. A defeated country must re-establish the country after signing a treaty of peace. We cannot hope that Japan's economy will always remain at the current stage. And in fact, Japan's economy has gradually recovered under MacArthur's support. Therefore, we must make its development not conflict with our country's development. China and Japan are both in East Asia, both in the temperate zone, and have many of the same products. For example, China produces silk and Japan also produces silk. China and Japan are both industrially backward countries, and the stages of industrial development are similar. The focus of industry also has many similarities. For example, the more successful industrial development in China at present is the textile industry, and Japan's exports are also mainly textiles. We should impose restrictions on this in the treaty of peace so that it cannot compete against us.</p>
<p>Based on these three principles, we can cite a few practical problems for discussion:</p>
<p>(1) Compensation issue Regarding Japan's compensation, we have heard about the Pauley Plan, the U.S. State Department's plan, the MacArthur Plan, etc. The impression we get is that one is more tolerant than the other, and the amount of compensation is reduced one by one. According to the Central News Agency's telecommunications on July 26, the United States will propose that all countries give up compensation claims. This is tantamount to a threat to China, which has been ravaged by the Japanese army. First, we need factory machines to produce the materials destroyed by the Japanese army during the war, to compensate for the suppression and destruction of China's industrial development during the eight years of war, and to revive industry and the economy after the war. Second, we should designate a batch of complete factories that are needed by our country and stipulate the date for demolition and relocation. Third, we should designate several kinds of Japanese industrial products needed by our country, such as gauze, fertilizer, and rayon, and stipulate the quantity and order them to pay compensation in installments and deliver them every year. Fourth, we should also demand cash compensation. Japan destroyed countless properties and houses in our country during the war. These real capital of Chinese citizens should be compensated by Japanese factories and products. However, Japan's aggression also caused inflation in our country, which has increased to this day. Japan is also responsible for this. We have the right to demand a large amount of cash compensation to stabilize our currency.</p>
<p>(2) Industrial level issue. The United States plans to retain or restore Japan's industry to the production level of 1930 to 1934, which is very terrible. Therefore, we believe that: First, the standard we adopt should be the standard of living rather than the standard of production. We know that from 1931 to 1937, Japan's production index increased three times, while the people's consumption index only increased by 40%. This is because most of Japan's production at that time was stored for war, and part of it became the profits and assets of the chaebols. Therefore, the increase in the level of production is not necessarily good for the general Japanese people. We should stipulate a standard of living for the Japanese people after the war, and then determine the amount of industry to be retained according to their needs. Second, the standard of living we adopt should not be the standard of living of the Japanese people before the war, but the minimum standard of living of the Asian people after the war. In the eyes of Americans who grew up in wealth, the standard of living of the Japanese people is already very low. But in the eyes of Chinese and Indians, the life of the Japanese people can be said to be extremely comfortable. The reason why the life of the Japanese people is superior to other countries in Asia is obviously the result of the aggression and plunder of neighboring countries' land resources and the economic exploitation of neighboring countries in the past 100 years. Today, the various invaded countries in Asia have united and, with the help of other allied countries, have overthrown Japan's aggression, but they still have to let her retain the fruits of aggression. That's a wrong! Today, Japan is shouting "hunger exports", but thousands upon thousands of Chinese are really gnawing on tree bark and grass roots. Therefore, we should first compare the living standards of the people of various countries in Asia, determine the lowest one, and then determine the amount of Japanese industry to be retained according to the needs of this standard.</p>
<p>(3) International trade issues Japan is a country that cannot be self-sufficient. In order to ensure that its peacetime economy cannot be turned into a wartime economy, we have said before that we want to make it so. Then, in order to meet the normal needs of the Japanese people in peacetime, Japan's foreign trade should naturally be opened. However, in the treaty of peace, we should also add a few restrictions on this: First, the types of imported goods must be limited to those that are really needed for people's livelihood. Even though we have dismantled the munitions industry in Japan, if we do not supervise its import trade, it can still import military raw materials from foreign countries for future use. Therefore, the types of goods it imports must be strictly restricted. Second, the quantity of various imported goods each year shall not exceed the difference between the actual consumption of such goods and the domestic production. Many goods can be used as necessities for people's livelihood in peacetime, but they become genuine military supplies in wartime. We cannot let Japan pretend to maintain people's livelihood and secretly store them. Even genuine necessities for people's livelihood that cannot be used for military purposes should not be allowed to be imported beyond the actual consumption gap and stored, because if Japan is to launch a war again, both necessities for people's livelihood and munitions are important. Third, the Chinese government should have the right to intervene in the types and quantities of goods exported by Japan to China at any time. Under today's foreign exchange and trade controls implemented in our country, the dumping of Japanese goods is not worth worrying about, but this kind of control will be abolished sooner or later. We recall the history of Japanese goods dumping and the bitterness of resisting Japanese economic aggression at that time, and we deeply feel that such a regulation is indispensable in the treaty of peace.</p>

<h3>Security Council Takes Drastic Action: Urges Immediate Ceasefire Between Dutch and Indonesians; Dutch Prime Minister Still Hopes for U.S. Mediation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 2nd – United Press reports that the European Manager, to understand the Netherlands' position in the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, sent written questions to Dutch Prime Minister Beel, which Mr. Beel has answered. Question: What preconditions and guarantees does the Netherlands require before mediation can be realized? Answer: I firmly believe that U.S. mediation will facilitate a solution to the problem. Question: Do you think the war can end soon? Answer: I firmly believe that the goals the Netherlands wants to achieve will be achieved soon. Question: Is it true that Dutch troops are causing widespread destruction in various places? Answer: Untrue. On the contrary, Indonesia has implemented a scorched-earth policy, and the losses suffered by overseas Chinese are particularly heavy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] The United Nations Security Council, after resolving last night to urge an immediate ceasefire between the Dutch and Indonesians and to resolve the dispute through arbitration or other peaceful means, issued a note to the Dutch and Indonesian governments within hours. This is the most drastic action taken since the establishment of the United Nations organization. To implement the resolution, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, the Security Council's last resort is to resort to economic sanctions and sever diplomatic relations with all fifty-five member states. If necessary, it may also take land, sea, and air military action to maintain or restore international peace and security. Although Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kleffens told reporters after the meeting that he had no comment, both the Dutch and Indonesians are expected to comply with the Security Council's instructions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The Security Council, after discussing the Indonesian issue for only two days, decided tonight that the Netherlands and Indonesia should immediately cease fire and resolve the dispute through arbitration or other means. This unprecedented resolution is the first action taken by the United Nations organization since its establishment to directly stop a war. The vote was eight in favor and zero against, with the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium abstaining. The United Kingdom stated that abstention was not an exercise of the veto power. The French representative, Mr. Parodi, said that he would rather vote against it, but a negative vote would be an exercise of the veto power, which would eliminate the case, so he changed his vote to abstention. After the vote, the chairman, Syrian representative Mr. Gory, immediately ordered the Secretariat to notify the Dutch and Indonesian governments of this resolution. The Security Council then adjourned until next Monday. During today's five-hour discussion, the Soviet representative advocated that both sides' troops withdraw to their original defenses as a precondition for mediation, but this was ultimately rejected. The U.S. proposal, amended and passed by France, allowed the Security Council to recognize the Republic of Indonesia. The Dutch representative argued vehemently against this, saying that Indonesia has not yet become an independent country.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The Security Council discussed the Dutch-Indonesian issue today. The British representative suggested that the issue be temporarily shelved until the United States has facilitated a reconciliation between the warring Dutch and Indonesian parties. Representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union both expressed their opposition. Soviet representative Gromyko also condemned the U.S.'s mediation efforts, ironically stating: "The Netherlands now clearly wants to control the current situation and continue until the Dutch army achieves victory. Therefore, I oppose the Security Council waiting for the results of the U.S. mediation before discussing it again." The Netherlands' current attitude of accepting mediation is clearly to delay the matter so that it can be in a "favorable position" in relation to Indonesia.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman could not confirm the rumor circulating in diplomatic circles here that China supports the actions taken by India and Australia on the Indonesian issue in the Security Council. The government, on the other hand, said that the aforementioned rumor was an interesting speculation, but the Chinese Foreign Ministry has decided to wait and see how the situation develops before instructing its representative to the Security Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 2nd] The Dutch cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the United Nations Security Council's demand for a ceasefire between the Dutch and Indonesians.</p>
<h3>Dutch Army Continues to Advance; Yogyakarta Declares Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 2nd] A Dutch communique on the 2nd stated: "Dutch forces have occupied Bojong Wardojo in central Java, which is burning in a large fire." The communique also announced that Indonesian troops have infiltrated Dutch positions in various parts of Java. The communique made no mention of the United Nations Security Council's action yesterday, which decided that the war should cease. The Dutch commander-in-chief apparently has not had time to consider the United Nations' decision.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 2nd] According to a Dutch military communique, Dutch forces have occupied Kabandjahe, 50 miles south of Medan, the capital of Sumatra. As a result of Indonesia's scorched-earth policy, the city is engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] Indonesian radio reported that the capital of the Republic, Yogyakarta, has declared martial law. The government of the Republic has appointed Lieutenant General Urip Sumohardjo, Chief of Staff of the Army, as the military commander of Yogyakarta, assisted by ten generals, responsible for the city's defense. A Dutch communique announced that the oil depot at Cilacap port on the south coast of Java was set on fire by the Republic's army and is currently burning. The Republic's army is implementing a widespread scorched-earth strategy in central Java. Sugar factories, cigarette factories, and coconut factories have all been set on fire and destroyed.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Comment on Dutch-Indonesian Dispute:</h3>
<p>Saying it has Created Asian Power Solidarity</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 1st] The San Francisco Chronicle published a commentary today entitled "Asian Colonialism is Dead," stating that India's appeal to the Security Council on behalf of Indonesia and China's support for Indonesia suggest that, although Japan has been defeated, the results of its war-mongering seem to have won Asia's unity against Western control. Omens are appearing in the Asian sky: "The situation of division and rule for hundreds of years is over. If Asian nations can unite against colonialism, no one country or combination of countries can revive it. This is something that the world should see." Asia may still lag behind in technology and military strength, and one soldier from any Western country may have the power to kill a hundred Asians, but the guerrilla destruction and retaliation by hundreds of millions of Asians will eventually exhaust the resources and nerves of the colonial countries. If Western countries can recognize this inevitable fact, it will not only benefit their own countries but also the well-being of mankind.</p>
<h3>U.S. Mediation of Dutch-Indonesian Incident: State Department Opinions Diverge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] Some officials in the State Department's Far East Division recently stated that they are concerned that the U.S.'s mediation of the Indonesian incident, whether as a mediator or in some other capacity, may affect the U.S.'s friends and goodwill throughout Southeast Asia. It seems that officials within the State Department who are pro-Dutch and anti-Indonesian have been able to manipulate the U.S.'s actions regarding the Indonesian incident. According to "experts" within the State Department, opinions on the Indonesian incident are divided into two factions: those dealing with European affairs are fully supporting the Netherlands, while those responsible for Asian and Pacific affairs believe that Indonesia's reasons are sufficient. This matter is an open secret in Washington.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Leader Huang Enshi Requests Earnest Protection for Overseas Compatriots</h3>
<p>300 Refugees Escape to Medan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 1st] Huang Enshi (brother of Huang Zhenqiu), a local overseas Chinese leader, today telegraphed Chairman Chiang and other ministers, requesting that concrete steps be taken to protect overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra, and stating that allocating funds for relief may not be an effective way to guarantee the lives and property of overseas Chinese. The telegram stated that the suffering of overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra from arson, murder, and robbery by Indonesian troops is more widespread and profound than the Tangerang Massacre. If our government does not have concrete protection measures, the 800,000 overseas Chinese in the two regions will face more terrifying and unimaginable dangers.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch, Nanjing, 2nd] Diplomatic sources report that over 300 refugees who had been trapped in Deli, a large town 12 miles from Medan, by Indonesian troops have been rescued and have arrived in Medan. Our consulate in the area has provided shelter and relief. There are also many refugees in Tanjung Morawa, 40 miles from Medan, and our consulate is currently trying to rescue them. The consulate has also sent personnel to Air Molek to establish a relief branch, responsible for providing relief to the thousand-plus overseas Chinese who have been made homeless by the war.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister to Attend Pan-American Conference in Person</h3>
<p>Opening Date is the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 1st] The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Marshall will lead the U.S. delegation to the Pan-American Conference to be held in Rio de Janeiro on August 15. The purpose of the conference is to maintain international peace and security. The delegation announced today that the number of U.S. representatives is 39, including the State Department's Pan-American Defense Bureau and advisors from the U.S. Army. It is generally expected that other individuals will join the conference when it opens. The convening of this conference is based on an agreement reached at the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace held in Mexico City in February and March 1945. The purpose of this conference is to adjust wartime security measures in the Western Hemisphere to suit peacetime conditions.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Ramadier Describes Situation in Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] Prime Minister Ramadier stated at a weekly press conference that, after French troops engaged in military activities in Vietnam, they have liberated most areas and important cities. From now on, it will only be necessary to eliminate the remaining resistance in the mountains and forests of the interior, so the French army must understand the tactics of the Viet Minh army and adopt guerrilla strategies. Vietnam has now once again become a French asset, and law and order have been restored in most areas.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Attempts to Seize the Whole World; The U.S. Must Stop It: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton Issues Warning</h3>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 2nd] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton declared today that the Soviet Union has now "clearly expressed its intention to seize Europe and then seize the whole world." The United States must warn the Soviet Union to stop this plan to conquer the world, otherwise it may lead to war. We do not need to resort to force at present. By relying on the leadership of the major powers and small countries pursuing American democratic ideals, we can prevent the Soviet Union from stepping out of line. If the Soviet Union does not yield and learn the behavior of civilized countries, we should expel the Soviet Union from the United Nations organization and work alone. If we do not stop it now, we will inevitably be forced to use force one day. At that time, the Soviet military may be superior to us in terms of personnel and weapons, which will be a difficult task. However, we have the atomic bomb, and I firmly believe that the Soviet Union does not have it, at least not yet.</p>

<h3>International Trade Conference: Non-UN Member States Will Be Invited to Participate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 1st] The United Nations Economic and Social Council today passed India's resolution inviting the Republic of Indonesia to participate in the International Trade and Employment Conference to be held in Havana, Cuba, in November. The vote was six in favor, four against, and eight abstentions. The resolution stated: "The Economic and Social Council recognizes that the Republic of Indonesia enjoys de facto authority in foreign commercial relations and recognizes that the participation of the Republic of Indonesia would promote the objectives of the conference. Therefore, it decides to invite the government of the Republic of Indonesia to participate in the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference." Those who voted against the resolution were the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, and France.</p>

<h3>Two Factories in the U.S. Zone of Germany Manufacture War Materials for a Foreign Country; Five People in Charge Arrested by U.S. Military</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 1st] It is reported that U.S. Army officials said that two factories in the U.S. Zone of Germany were manufacturing war materials for a foreign country without the permission of the U.S. military government. U.S. officials found a large number of hidden materials to avoid inspection, including aircraft, tanks, and gyroscopes for submarines that were half completed, parts for aircraft wings and bodies, theodolites for observing rocket flights, and periscopes for submarines. According to an official statement, Army, Economic Affairs, and Signals Corps officials discovered the above-mentioned hidden military supplies when inspecting two factories of the Askania Company in Mariendorf in the U.S. Zone, but officials did not name the foreign country. Subsequently, the U.S. stationed detectives around the factory, closed the factory gates, sent troops to search the interior, and arrested five people who were being held in custody in accordance with the Allied Control Authority's regulations prohibiting the manufacture, transportation, or possession of war materials.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 2nd] Colonel Boyle, the American investigator in charge of investigating two factories in the U.S. Zone that manufactured war materials for a "foreign country," said that the products manufactured by the two factories were orders from the Teltow Company in the Soviet-occupied zone. Teltow has close ties to the two factories, but Boyle refused to specify which country was the "foreign country." According to a German journalist, before the end of the European War and before the arrival of the U.S. military in Berlin, Soviet troops had moved much of the equipment from the two factories to the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, and several engineers and technicians went with them. After the news of the search of the two factories was released, German newspapers published it in large letters, but the Soviet organ newspaper only mentioned it briefly and omitted the section involving the "foreign country."</p>

<h3>Establishing a Democratic Japan: Mission Not Yet Accomplished; Australian Foreign Minister Issues Statement Before Leaving Japan</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt departed for home this morning. Before his departure, he stated: "General MacArthur has succeeded in eliminating Japan's war-making capabilities, but it is difficult to say that he has completely achieved his mission in establishing a democratic Japan. As for the U.S.'s proposed preparatory meeting for the peace treaty, it may be convened around the beginning of September, and the formal conference may be held in January or February next year."</p>

<p>[United Press, Yokohama, 2nd] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, accompanied by his wife and Paul, the director of the Australian mission to Japan, left Japan on the Australian warship "Hobart" at midnight on the 1st, concluding his nine-day unofficial inspection tour.

Evatt reiterated his optimism about the early convening of the peace conference. Evatt also said that the opinions and advice given by MacArthur and other occupation officials were of utmost value to Australia in its future consideration of the security and well-being of the Pacific. The security and well-being of the Pacific are the goals we must pursue at the Japanese peace conference. This goal is not only related to ourselves but also to international peace and international justice. Australia believes that the Japanese peace conference should be negotiated democratically, granting the eleven countries that participated in the Pacific War full rights to participate in the conference and the future monitoring of the implementation of the treaty. This opinion of Australia has received widespread support here.</p>

<h3>U.S. Air Force Day Celebrated Enthusiastically, "Dream Boat" Super Fortress Sets New International Flight Record</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Air Force, celebrations were held in capitals such as Moscow, Tokyo, Berlin, Santiago, Paris, Nanjing, and major cities across the United States. The U.S. Air Force, which had 2.5 million personnel during wartime, has now been reduced to 310,000. Airfields were opened for public viewing. Air Force officials delivered speeches, urging the nation to pay attention to the continued expansion of the U.S. Air Force program. One of the biggest highlights of Air Force Day was the flight of seven B-29 Superfortress aircraft directly from Tokyo to Washington, covering a distance of 7,000 miles in approximately 30 hours, with only one refueling stop in Alaska. A squadron of P-80 Shooting Star aircraft flew from New York, Chicago, and Miami to Washington, setting an unofficial record of approximately 500 miles per hour on average. The "Dream Boat" Superfortress, famous for dropping the atomic bomb, set an official international record, covering a distance of 10,000 kilometers at an average speed of 277 miles per hour. The old record of 193.6 miles per hour was set by a Frenchman in 1939.</p>

Dunphoss also stated that U.S. infantry battalions and their artillery units can now be airlifted. In the future, entire U.S. infantry divisions and all their artillery units can be airlifted into combat, which may offer hope for avoiding war.</p>
<h3>Seoul Conference Deadlock Unresolved, U.S. Representative Clarifies Stance, Unwilling to Let Extremists Control Korean Politics</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 2nd] U.S. Major General Brown of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission issued a written statement refuting the Soviet proposal that only political parties with more than 10,000 members should be eligible for consultation, stating: "Several important political parties will not be able to meet this condition." The statement concluded: "The United States has no prejudice towards Korean political parties. The United States is concerned about the interests of the Korean people and does not want extreme left or extreme right political parties or groups to dominate and control the future political situation in Korea."</p>
<p>Soviet Explanation</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 2nd] Soviet representative Stikov held a reception for the press corps at Deoksugung Palace today, explaining in detail the reasons for the deadlock in the Seoul conference. Stikov stated: The Soviet side insists that all Korean political parties must provide a register of members, and only political parties or groups with more than 10,000 members are eligible for consultation. All political parties or groups that oppose the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference Declaration and anti-trusteeship parties or groups are not eligible for consultation. The Soviet side also proposed that a committee be formed within the first subcommittee to specifically study this issue, but the U.S. side rejected it, which is the main reason for the deadlock in the Joint Commission. However, the Soviet representative will continue to work hard to implement its consistent position in order to promote the early formation of a unified Korean government and not disappoint the Korean people.</p>

<h3>British Statement on Geneva International Tariff Agreement, Declares Temporary Non-Signing, States that Britain Must Implement Discriminatory Import Controls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 1st] The British government has informed the United States that it cannot sign the nearly completed multilateral tariff agreement in the Geneva Trade Conference unless the clause prohibiting discriminatory import controls is waived for Britain.</p>
<p>It is believed that British Trade Minister Cripps raised this issue when he met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Clayton in Paris yesterday. It is understood that Cripps told Clayton that Britain would not be able to avoid implementing discriminatory import controls for at least a year in order to conserve its foreign exchange reserves. U.S. officials believe that this statement by Britain will not only undermine the tariff agreement in the Geneva negotiations but also hinder the U.S. Congress from taking favorable action on the Marshall Plan for European aid. The establishment of a global trade rules agreement is likely to be shelved due to the lack of British support, in which case the only price the United States hoped to obtain for assisting Britain and European recovery will be in vain. The United States originally hoped to achieve its trade policy goals by completing the financial agreement with Britain and the recent launch of a plan to aid the post-war world. Now that Britain has definitely requested the United States to exempt it from fulfilling the obligation in Article 9 of the Anglo-American financial agreement not to discriminate against imports from the United States, if Britain refuses to sign the tariff agreement or obtains an exemption from the clause prohibiting discriminatory imports, countries in the Western Hemisphere and countries in the dollar area will suffer a major blow.</p>

<h3>Conspiracy to Murder for Money on the Same Car, Arrest of Briton Yetley, Admits to Having Traded with the Deceased, Strong Suspicion, Taken into Custody</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Headquarters, together with the New City Branch, arrested a Briton named "Yetley" last night. His full name is "Charlie Archer". He is suspected of being the murderer who shot Yu Shengxiao in Qingpu County the night before last.</p>
<p>However, in Yetley Archer's confession at the police station, he flatly denied the charges. Moreover, many of the points he confessed were inconsistent with the testimonies of various witnesses, which raised suspicions. The police station personnel in charge stated that since yesterday was Saturday, they had not yet notified the British Consulate, so the details of the investigation could not be released to the public.</p>
<p>The incident involves a man from Ningbo named Yu Shengxiao, 31 years old, who started by selling steamed buns and other foods. Having accumulated savings, he also engaged in black market trading of gold and currency. One morning, a Westerner came to buy five gold bars and arranged to pay in the afternoon. At that time, the Westerner left in a car together, and when they drove to Wujiaxiang in Qibao Town, Qingpu County, Yu Shengxiao was suddenly shot by the Westerner and pushed into the wilderness. Villagers found him bleeding profusely and barely breathing. When asked what happened, he only said: "My name is Yu Shengxiao, I live at 623 Tiantong Road. The person who killed me is named Yetley." After saying this, he lost consciousness and died on the way to the hospital. He was shot three times, twice in the head and once in the chest.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the police station went to 623 Tiantong Road to investigate based on the location mentioned. His wife said that her husband had been engaged in black market trading of gold and currency in the Central Road area and had been in contact with a Westerner named Yetley. Yetley had bought five gold bars from her husband that morning, and her husband had not returned since leaving.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Police Headquarters went to the Central Road area to investigate Yetley's whereabouts. They learned from Yu's colleagues that Yetley did exist and knew his address. They arrested him that night.</p>
<p>According to Yetley Archer's statement to the police investigators, he had only one transaction with Yu involving 60 U.S. dollars, and there were no other dealings. He did not arrange to meet Yu on the day in question. He returned home around 5:00 p.m. on that day and knew nothing about the shooting of Yu Shengxiao.</p>
<p>Last night, police officers repeatedly questioned Yetley Archer on relevant points, but Yetley Archer insisted that he did not own a vehicle and had never been to the Qingpu area.</p>
<p>Yetley Archer is a Briton, born in Hong Kong, 33 years old. During the enemy-puppet period, he met a Russian woman in a concentration camp. After the victory, they officially married. According to the Russian woman, Yetley Archer is a legitimate businessman and would never commit murder. He runs a business with a Chinese man named Lu on the upper floor of No. 15 Central Road. He left home that morning and returned home between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. In the evening at 9 pm, they even went to the Jinmen Theater together to watch "Looking Back on the Old Days". At that time, he met a dentist who currently works at the Hongqiao Sanatorium, meaning that this dentist could testify.</p>
<p>When the Russian woman spoke about the above facts, she was very calm, but she was vague about the exact time Yetley Archer returned home and the dentist's name, unable to be precise.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked that if Yetley Archer was a legitimate businessman, he should have friends who could vouch for him. The Russian woman replied that Yetley Archer knew many British and American people, but she feared that they would not be willing to come forward to testify.</p>
<p>When asked where she lived, the Russian woman said: "No. 16 Albert Road," in a small inn run by a Westerner. However, when the reporter went to find it later, there was no such number. However, according to Yetley Archer's statement to the police station, he lived at "No. 4, Lane 186, Albert Road." When the reporter went to ask again, the place was an apartment-style small inn, but the owner insisted that there was no Yetley Archer living there.</p>
<p>It is generally estimated that it takes about one hour to travel by car between Qibao and Shanghai. Therefore, if the shooting occurred around 5:00 p.m., the murderer could have calmly returned to Shanghai before 9:00 p.m. Although his wife said that Yetley Archer returned home between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m., no one can confirm this.</p>
<p>When police officers went to Central Road to investigate with his colleagues, some people pointed out that Yetley Archer did indeed make an appointment with Yu Shengxiao that day to pay at the Fada Tailor Shop at Ningbo Road, Sichuan Road, between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., and had witnessed him and Yu Shengxiao driving towards the Bund together. The police station believes that Yetley Archer and his wife are highly suspicious and has ordered them to be detained. An active investigation is underway.</p>

<h3>Young Woman with a Bad Reputation Tragically Killed by Her Husband, Lured to Hongqiao, Strangled and Abandoned, Note Found on Corpse Leads to Successful Case Solved, Garment Maker Arrested and Confesses After Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Gu Fazhang, 28 years old, from Jingjiang, works as a garment maker in the Chengtai Fang No. 1 garment shop opened by Ni Xianhai on Gubal Road. Four years ago, he married a fellow villager Zhang (24 years old) in his hometown. They have no children. She came to Shanghai from the countryside half a month ago. Because it was not easy for Gu to find a house, he had his wife stay at a friend's house at No. 151 Panjiawan, Zhabei. Zhang had a bad reputation in the countryside for promiscuous relationships. Someone came to Shanghai to report this to Gu. Gu was very angry and interrogated her harshly, and there were several conflicts. Therefore, Gu had the idea of killing his wife. He discussed it with a person nicknamed "Bie San," wanting to put her to death. On the evening of July 29th, he made an appointment with "Bie San" somewhere. After Gu finished his work, he returned to the Panjia house and lured her out. They walked to the south of the Suzhou Creek and met "Bie San." They hired a taxi to go to a remote place in Xujiahui, but because there were so many people enjoying the cool air, it was inconvenient to act. They went to the ditch near the Huangjialang on Hongqiao Road. He paid the driver 36,000 yuan and told him to drive away. The three of them sat on the ground and chatted for a while. Unexpectedly, they used a rope to strangle her head and neck, then tied her hands behind her back and abandoned the body in the ditch. Afterwards, the murderer Gu Fazhang paid "Bie San" 150,000 yuan in legal tender as a reward, and they fled one after another. When Zhang was killed, she was wearing a white short shirt, black pants, jade-colored thread stockings, and blue shoes, with a cropped haircut. At 7:00 a.m. on the 31st, someone discovered the body and reported it to the Longhua Police Branch.

<h3>Exemption/Deferment 慰待金: Stop Imposing It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to replenish the慰待金, the Municipal Government previously drafted provisional measures for exempting and deferring conscription and requiring壮丁(strong young men) to pay 慰待金. In the application guidelines for 壮丁 applying for exemption and deferment of conscription in 1947, it was stipulated that the fee would be collected incidentally. Later, the Military Service Association resolved that "the collection procedure is troublesome, and the estimated revenue is not sufficient for the 慰待 families of conscripts, so a new method should be drafted." The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department has notified all districts to stop the incidental collection. The Municipal Government is now concerned that the outside world may not be aware of the truth, or that 各保(various 保s) may still collect fees when 壮丁 apply, so it has issued another order to prohibit this. If any personnel collect fees under any pretext, 壮丁 are allowed to report them with evidence for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>Placing Northern Henan Refugees in Foster Care: Henan Province Carefully Plans Relief Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kaifeng Dispatch] Recently, the number of refugees crossing south from northern Henan every day, gathering in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng and other places, is too large. To improve relief efforts, the Henan Provincial Government has instructed the Department of Social Affairs to draft measures for placing Northern Henan refugees in foster care. These measures were approved by the Provincial Committee on the 29th. Excerpts of the measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Zhengzhou area: (1) The Department of Social Affairs and Zheng County's emergency relief work, which was to end at the end of July, will, from August 1st, focus solely on refugee dispersal. (2) The Department of Social Affairs and Zheng County's emergency relief team, according to the original budget, was to be withdrawn at the end of July. From August 1st, a refugee dispersal station will be established in Zheng County. (3) Of the three porridge kitchens originally operated in Zheng County, the first one will be closed immediately, while the second and third will use existing materials and be closed when the food is depleted. (4) The 100 tons of food allocated by the Relief Sub-Administration will be mainly used to support refugee dispersal. (5) It is planned to transfer a portion of the emergency relief team to handle dispersal matters after the emergency relief work ends. A separate budget will be drafted and submitted to the Provincial Committee for review and approval. Before the central relief funds arrive, it is planned to temporarily borrow two hundred million yuan from the Grain Bureau to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Luoyang area: (1) In addition to the 100 million yuan already allocated for emergency relief in Luoyang, it is planned to establish a refugee dispersal station in Luoyang and allocate another 100 million yuan for refugee dispersal. (2) The Relief Sub-Administration will allocate 60 tons of food to Luoyang to support refugee dispersal.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Kaifeng area: (1) The Zhongmu porridge kitchen will continue to operate for the time being, and a Kaifeng refugee dispersal station will be established. (2) The Sub-Administration will allocate 40 tons of food to Kaifeng to support refugee dispersal, under the direction of the Department of Social Affairs. (July 30)</p>
<h3>External Transportation Suffocated: China Resembles an "Isolated Island"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Last year, Fuzhou averaged over two hundred ships entering and leaving its port each month. The situation has severely deteriorated in recent months, with very few ships on various routes. For example, the only passenger ship on the Fuzhou-Shanghai route, the "Zhoushan" has recently stopped running. The Fuzhou-Taiwan route used to have several Taiwan Navigation Company passenger ships regularly sailing, but now there is only one, the "Taiwan Navigation No. 1," with a carrying capacity of just over a hundred tons. The ship is small and overcrowded, with each trip packed beyond capacity. The only regular ship on the Fuzhou-Xiamen route is the Minjiang Downstream Company's "Yalu River" speedboat, which is also a small steamer of only about a hundred tons. Other northern routes have no regular ships and rely solely on occasional cargo ships taking on a few passengers. In terms of air transport, both the China and Central Aviation Companies have intermediate stations in Fuzhou. The former had opened routes to Shanghai, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, but recently suspended flights to Fuzhou due to disagreements with the air force station managing the airport. The latter only has one weekly round-trip flight between Shanghai, Fuzhou, Nanchang, and Hankou. Since Fuzhou is an intermediate stop with few flights, seating is limited. Moreover, Fuzhou's Yiyu Airport has no runway and lacks proper airport facilities. In rainy weather, the ground becomes muddy and aircraft cannot land. It is easy to imagine how much convenience this semi-crippled aviation base can provide for air transport. As for land transport: to travel from Fuzhou to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, one can only rely on dilapidated "old cars" struggling on desolate mountain roads, deterring travelers. With sea, land, and air transport all obstructed, Fuzhou's external transportation is in a state of "isolation," leaving people in Fuzhou with a sense of "suffocation." Many travelers, upon arriving in Fuzhou, are trapped and unable to proceed elsewhere, likening it to a "dead port" or "city of sorrow." The smoothness of transportation depends on the attraction of cargo transport. The current semi-stagnant state is a direct result of the decline in cargo transport due to sluggish production and reduced import and export trade. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's refusal to send large ships to Fuzhou is because there is no cargo to transport and no profit to be made. Other shipping companies are abandoning the Fuzhou route for the same reason. According to transportation industry insiders, ships coming to Fuzhou are not filled with cargo, and too many passengers illegally board without tickets, causing losses to the shipping companies, leading them to avoid the route. If this situation can be improved, Fuzhou's shipping may have a chance to turn around. (Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu from Fuzhou)</p>

<h3>Fuzhou-Xiamen Road Project: Progress Still Slow</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits Employees from Harassing Civilians</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 31st] Since the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road was reclassified as a national highway, the Ministry of Transportation has taken over the road reconstruction project in May. However, due to the incomplete arrival of machinery, progress remains slow. It has recently been reported that the Third General Brigade of the Road Construction Machinery Team and project employees serving on the road section, relying on their power, have been forcibly seizing civilian property, molesting women, and harassing residents along the route.

Yuan Guochin, the magistrate of Tainan County, where the mountain is located, has specially dispatched mountain youth representative Tang Shouren and mountain instructor Gao Xieshi to accompany and take care of them. A reporter from this newspaper will also participate. Since the Meteorological Bureau has a dedicated radio station on the mountain peak, maintaining regular contact with the outside world, it is expected that this newspaper may receive telegrams from the highest mountain on the West Pacific coast.

<h3>Taiwan Provincial Government Begins Construction on the Jieshou Hall, But Work Has Not Yet Started</h3>
<p>[Taipei Dispatch] The construction project of the Jieshou Hall in Taipei has been underway for more than half a year since it began last year. Although various parties have enthusiastically advocated fundraising for the construction, and a construction project committee has been established to plan the construction, the provincial people have donated generously and actively. However, due to the constant rise in prices, the estimated cost from last year has greatly increased to date, resulting in only drawing and designing for several months, and the construction project has barely started. Recently, due to the difficulty in raising funds, the authorities have cancelled the original proposal and disbanded the project committee. The provincial government has decided to use the site as the provincial government's main office, so that authority and management can be centralized. Chairman Wei is very concerned about this. It is understood that the total cost is approximately 30 million New Taiwan Dollars. The provincial government has now approved an allocation of approximately 20 million New Taiwan Dollars and handed it over to the Taiwan Provincial Public Works Bureau for reconstruction, instructing it to complete the project within one year. The bureau has now begun construction. It is noted that the site was originally the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, which was severely damaged in a massive Allied bombing on May 31, 1945.</p>

<h3>Wuhe Suffers from Prolonged Rain and Flooding</h3>
<p>Residents Urge Prompt Repair of Dikes</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu Dispatch] During the flood season, torrential rains are frequent.

<h3>Kunming Scoundrel Youth Swindles and Deceives: Posing as Minister Wang's Nephew, Scams the Public Office for Two Million Travel Expenses; Police Bureau Investigating the Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 2nd] A case of impersonation and fraud involving a person claiming to be Minister of Industry Wang Shijie's nephew recently occurred in Kunming. A man named Wang Minqian, 28 years old from Hubei, came to Kunming from Kaiyuan. He went to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, claiming to be Minister Wang's nephew and that he had been robbed on the way, requesting assistance to send him to Shanghai and that his uncle would remit the money back. The office, without suspecting anything, spent a total of 2.2 million yuan. Wang Yumei, the special commissioner of the office, then telegraphed Minister Wang, who replied yesterday: "Received the telegram, do not know this person, please do not provide further assistance, and please investigate if there is any incident of him swindling, and investigate immediately." The office then sent Wang Minqian to the police station. Wang Minqian claimed, "Minister Wang is indeed my uncle, he is not recognizing me now, probably because he is not satisfied with my past behavior." He confessed that he graduated from the Foreign Language Department of Central China University, later served as a translator, and taught at Dali Middle School. He came to Kunming to transfer to Shanghai to find a job and was robbed on the way, so he had to seek help. The police station is currently investigating the case and plans to transfer it to the court.</p>

<h3>Mongolian Banner Queen Qijunfeng and Son Murdered</h3>
<p>Our Newspaper Reporter Yang Chang, Baotou Airmail, July 27</p>
<p>On the afternoon of July 20, the news of Qijunfeng's murder spread to Guihua and then throughout the city.</p>
<p>The Ulanqab League's thirteen banners have an average of one bloody political struggle every four years. However, neither faction harms the young ruler; each is willing to hold the young king, hold the Zasak's military seal, and command the chanting lamas, idle Taijis, and "black people" who are always slaves. The simultaneous death of the young ruler and the queen this time shows, on the one hand, that hereditary kings are no longer seen as sacred by the people, and on the other hand, that the political struggle is becoming increasingly tragic. The opposition party is cutting the grass to eliminate future troubles. Because the queen and young ruler of the Western Gong Banner were murdered, the banner has become the current focus of the Suiyuan and Mengjiang situation. Today, the representatives of the Western Gong Banner arrived in Guihua from Baotou, and it is unknown how the situation will develop in the future.</p>
<p>The Western Gong Banner is a small country, belonging to the Urad tribe. The Urad and Sizi tribes, the Right Wing Banner of Khalkha (i.e., Darhan Banner), and the Maoming'an Banner are in an alliance, collectively known as the Ulanqab League. The Urad tribe is divided into three banners: the Former Banner is the Western Gong Banner, the Middle Banner is the Middle Gong Banner, and the Rear Banner is the Eastern Gong Banner. Although the Urad tribe, Sizi tribe, Khalkha tribe, and Maoming'an tribe are all descendants of Genghis Khan, they do not belong to the same branch. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, each banner has been independent and autonomous, and the League Leader is now a figurehead. The National Government and the Provincial Government provide many provisions, ammunition, and funds annually to cultivate troops, run schools, and provide disaster relief to the Mongolian banners unconditionally. The rulers of the Mongolian banners only offer a few pieces of colored silk and war horses, but exchange them with the Provincial Government for the National Government's formal appointment orders for positions such as Zasak, Security Commander, and Eastern and Western Co-Directors. The map of the Western Gong Banner looks like an upside-down Ruyi (scepter), occupying the entire Urad Mountain and half of the Lang Mountain. The plains include the Ming'an River of Da Shetai, the Middle Beach in front of the Urad Mountain, and the banks of the Wu Jia River under the Lang Mountain.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance divided the Western Gong Banner into two parts: the Urad Mountain area east of Anbei became the domain of Ebaoqi, and the Lang Mountain area west of Anbei became the world of Qijunfeng. The essence of the Western Gong Banner is in the Urad Mountain area, not in the Lang Mountain area. Qijunfeng recruited Han Chinese from Houtao and Hao Youlong, the son of Selingbu, and barely organized five or six hundred cavalry, but could not compete with Ebaoqi. Therefore, after the victory, he still requested the Suiyuan Provincial Government to restore Ebaoqi's original position. Although Hao Youlong is young, he seized many weapons from the puppet army and the Communist army by taking advantage of the National Army's surrender in Baotou and the Communist Army's siege of Baotou, forming a force to succeed his father. Because Qijunfeng served as acting Zasak and Security Commander, others could not serve as Zasak and Security Commander. As early as last winter, students from the Western Gong Banner publicly arrested Qijunfeng's most trusted chief of staff and imprisoned him in the Twelfth War Zone Military Law Supervision Department. On the 15th of this month, the Western Gong Banner held a "Chugra" (assembly), and the queen announced the dismissal of Hao Youlong and declared that she would detain Ebaoqi. On the 20th, on the way back to Baotou, she met rebel soldiers disguised as bandits who assassinated her.</p>
<p>Qijunfeng and Qifahe were victims of internal strife in the Mongolian banner. The young king was twelve years old this year, like a flash in the pan. The queen was thirty-three years old this year, and her life was full of tragedy. The queen was the granddaughter of the Alashan Prince and the adopted daughter of the Darlagte Prince's daughter-in-law. Her origins were very noble, but she was ill-fated. Her father, Deyichen, and her elder brother, Luo Jingrui, were killed by the former Tawan and the current Dawan in 1931 and 1934, respectively, for assisting General Feng Yuxiang in the National Revolution. At the age of twelve, she left the Princess Mansion in Dingyuanying and fled to her aunt, Old Lady Qi's house. Her original Chinese name was Luo Yulan, but she was later adopted by her aunt and renamed Qijunfeng. Qijunfeng's national fame during the War of Resistance was entirely due to her aunt's planning. Qijunfeng was not as beautiful as the immortals as portrayed in Chongqing newspapers, but she was solemn and gentle. She could speak fluent Mandarin, which was a characteristic of the Alashan Banner aristocracy. Although she graduated from elementary school, she studied diligently after the death of King Shi and could read newspapers, approve official documents, and give public speeches eloquently. She also wore military uniforms in the bedroom, not only to maintain the dignity of the queen but also to show that she wanted to be a Mongolian female hero. Qijunfeng and King Shi only had one son, and there were many rumors about this. Those who opposed her said that his origins were unknown. The child's Mongolian name was Alatan Oqier, the same name as King A of Hangjin Banner, so he was also called Little King A. The reason why Little King A had his mother's Qi surname was that all direct descendants of Genghis Khan had the Qi surname, and there were over a hundred people with the Qi surname among prominent figures in Suiyuan and Mengjiang. When Little King A was three years old, he shouted "Support the Leader" in front of Chairman Chiang. He was a top student in schools in Shanba and Guihua. Qijunfeng originally planned to govern herself and planned to send Qifa Wu to study in the United States, but he died like a comet in a storm. The Urad Mountain and Lang Mountain of the Western Gong Banner are economic treasures, and internationally they are an eight-hundred-mile-long Great Wall. If the Western Gong Banner allowed Qijunfeng to complete unification within ten years and let Qifa Wu return from the United States to build, it could become a fertile border area with coal, iron, fish, and rice. In short, the murder of Qijunfeng and her son is a loss to the Mongolian banner and a misfortune to the country.</p>

<h3>Autumn Semester is Approaching; Book Shortage in the Province Continues to be Severe</h3>
<p>A Small Number of Booksellers Seize the Opportunity to Profit by Charging High Prices</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Nanchang Aerial Dispatch] As the autumn semester approaches, the book shortage in this province is quite serious. A small number of schools here, after receiving notices from Shanghai bookstores, remitted money to Shanghai to order national standard textbooks. The original plan stated that the books would be delivered by the end of July at the latest. However, the deadline has passed without any news. Inquiries made through friends in Shanghai revealed that the publication dates for textbooks for senior primary schools and middle schools are still distant and uncertain, and there are only sample books for junior primary schools, making it impossible to deliver the goods for the time being. In addition to their resentment, the schools have reported all the facts to the administrative authorities for verification, requesting that they forward the matter to the Ministry of Education to order the books to be delivered in full and to issue licenses carefully to prevent the continued occurrence of undelivered orders. Furthermore, the selling price of national standard textbooks here, whether new or revised editions from major publishers such as Commercial Press and World Book Company, is 112 times the listed price. However, in addition to the book shortage, the market situation is quite chaotic. It is reported that some small publishers are seizing the opportunity to raise prices, so schools are asking bookstores to request the Ministry of Education to issue an order announcing a price limit to reduce the burden on students.</p>

Please continue to supplement the National Education Classes as much as possible to rescue children who have dropped out of school. (2) Please issue teacher appointment letters for the next semester as soon as possible. Director Gu婉言 replied to each of them as follows: (1) Due to insufficient funds in the municipal government's budget, it will probably be difficult to increase the number of classes in the next semester. The existing classes in each school will remain in their original state. (2) It will be decided by the board of directors and supervisors before being submitted to the Education Bureau for discussion. (3) The appointment letters for the next semester will be issued as soon as possible. Section Chief Zhu then added briefly: Private school principals who also serve as heads of National Education Classes and private school workers should find a way to petition the municipal government so that they can also enjoy the same in-kind allowances as educational personnel. With this, the teachers were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>Students of the Jiao Tong University's Marine Engineering Department Still Haven't Been Able to Get Internships</h3>
<p>The Navigation Administration Promised, but Companies Shirked Responsibility</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] Regarding the request by students of the Marine Engineering Department of Jiao Tong University to intern at major shipping companies during the summer vacation, the Shanghai Navigation Administration and the Shipping Industry Association had already agreed and planned to use the tonnage of each company's ships as the standard for allocating the number of interns. However, in fact, the major shipping companies have repeatedly shirked their responsibilities and refused to accept them, so the group of students who are enthusiastic about internships have not been able to get on board for internships. It is reported that the relevant authorities are quite dissatisfied with the short-sighted behavior of major shipping companies, who only pay lip service to the lack of talent, but do not fulfill their responsibility to support future generations.</p>
<h3>Director Gu Gave a Talk Yesterday on the Issue of Fees for Primary and Secondary Schools; the Education Bureau is scheduled to listen to the opinions of Municipal Primary Schools on the 6th; Private Schools will hold a meeting on the 15th to Draft Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of fees for primary and secondary schools in this city for the next semester, which is of concern to all sectors of society, Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau stated yesterday that the procedure for determining fees for private schools is that each private primary and secondary school first drafts standards, reports them to the Education Bureau, which reviews them and provides comments, and then submits them to the Municipal Government for submission to the Municipal Council for discussion and final decision. The fee standards for private schools in the next semester will be determined by referring to two points: the comparison between the price of rice at the beginning of the spring semester and the current price of rice in August, and the comparison of the increase in the salaries of public school teachers since the last semester. The board of directors of the Private Primary and Secondary School Principals Association will meet on the 15th of this month to discuss this issue and draft fee collection standards. The Education Bureau has not yet made a decision. For the municipal primary schools, the Education Bureau has scheduled a meeting with the principals of the national schools in the urban area at Aurora University at 3:00 PM on Wednesday, the 6th of this month, to listen to the opinions of the principals on the issue of miscellaneous fees for the next semester.

<h3>Guo Zhen Cup Women's Volleyball; Municipal No. 1 and Youlian Win; Men's Group Jiguang and Huayan B Triumph</h3>

The men's group will have the Soviet Union playing Cooper. The results of yesterday's matches and today's schedule are recorded below:</p>
<p>Youlian Defeats Aiguang (Women)</p>
<p>Youlian and You team both have hopes of winning the women's championship this year. The match against Aiguang yesterday can be said to have been "solved easily." Chen Meizhen, Zhu Jinhe, Zhu Min, and others all had good performances. Zhu Min's serve was quite fierce. The score in the first game was closer, but in the second game, Aiguang's Chen Xian was disorganized and unable to fulfill his duties, so the opponent went with the flow. Lu Xianchun and Li Muzhen of Aiguang also resisted quite strongly.</p>

<p>Municipal No. 1 Defeats Fuhua (Women)</p>
<p>The female players of Municipal No. 1 Middle School can all jump and hit the ball, and they are brave in spirit. It is not difficult to become a good team. In the first game, Fuhua gave a start with a score of 21 to 10, and it was completed in one go. Who would have expected that in the second game, the players of Municipal No. 1 would be extra united, with Xue Yuehua, Wang Qiman, and others cooperating from front to back, and Xue's spike blocking showed skill. Municipal No. 1 managed to pull back one game. The third game was the decisive key. Municipal No. 1 met the attack with falls, not hesitating to sacrifice. "Heaven did not disappoint those who worked hard." At the last moment, it was still a tie at 19 points. Xue Yuehua served powerfully and increased one point. When Peter served again, back and forth across the net, Fuhua carelessly made a big mistake. Municipal No. 1 actually won 2-1 and cheered.</p>

<h3>Important Battle in the Table Tennis Finals; Jingwu vs. Lianxing Tonight</h3>

Generals such as Zhang Xuehui, Ouyang Wei, Yang Kaiyun, and Gao Hongxing are participating in the battle, and their momentum is strong and unparalleled. Lianxing is composed of elites and has emerged as a dark horse, breaking the Mail A, defeating Hualian, and winning the Yuan team. These are all outstanding works. Currently, it has only lost to Huxing once. Tonight, they will face the ever-victorious Jingwu. If they can fight bravely and get rid of arrogance, the victory or defeat is still uncertain. When the two heroes meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. The names of both sides are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>(Jingwu) Han Dehui (captain), Ouyang Wei, Zhang Xuewei, Yang Kaiyun, Gao Hongxing, Chen Zengliang, Shui Hangao, Xu Sunjia, Gu Shenghui.</p>

<h3>Basketball Committee Resolution; Pingguang Protest Rejected; Referee Error Not Absolutely Denied; Obstruction by Players Outside the Court Should Result in Forfeiture</h3>
<p>The Standing Committee Meeting of the Basketball Committee of the Municipal Sports Association was held in conjunction with the Municipal Gymnasium at the Jing'an Building Clubhouse at 5:00 PM yesterday. In addition to reporting on the various affairs of the association, several important motions were passed. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Report Items: (1) The financial settlement of this year's basketball league and the Mayor's Cup, (2) The process of conducting the basketball theory test competition, (3) The circumstances of the Shanghai competition of the Capital Xiang Team Women's Basketball Team.</p>
<p>Discussion Items: (1) A letter from the Chongqing Qi 16th Regiment basketball team stated that it will come to Shanghai for a competition at the end of October. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>(2) A letter from the Liangguang Flood Relief Association requested that the association host a charity match and invite the Hualian Oil Team and the Capital and ZhengLun basketball teams to compete in two matches. The resolution was passed and submitted to the Standing Council of the Municipal Sports Association for record.</p>
<p>(3) After the final between the Pingguang Team and the Xinsheng Team in Group B of the Second Basketball League, the Pingguang Team protested and requested a rematch. How should it be handled? Resolution: Regarding the point of referee error raised by the team, the letter from the refereeing committee did not absolutely deny it. A rematch could have been granted, but the team's players were unwilling to compete repeatedly during the game, and the players outside the court also invaded the court to obstruct the game's progress. This behavior violated the spirit of sports. The referee's decision to forfeit the game was proper, and the team's protest should be rejected.</p>
<p>(4) A letter from referee Wu requested that Xu Shunfu and Rong Chengen of the Xinsheng team be punished for their improper behavior during the game between the Xinsheng team and the Changshu team. Resolution: Xu Shunfu and Rong Chengen of the Xinsheng team should be warned. If similar situations occur again, they will be prohibited from participating in all competitions organized by the association.</p>

The rally was strong, further fueled by the momentum of foreign stocks. Major investors, such as numbers 235, Da Kangcheng, and 177, Hexing, became increasingly active buyers.

With Guangbang (Guangdong) merchants selling and exchange rates not assisting in buying, the price retreated to 92,500 yuan. A major investor, Mr. Tong, from a securities firm, then absorbed the stock, leading to a quick rebound. Unable to find opponents, he turned to shipping stocks. The midday close remained strong. Compared to the previous close, Yisili and shipping stocks each rose by around 10 percent. Other stocks each rose strongly by half a percent.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Initially High, Then Retraces; Factory-Supplied Silk and Silk Goods Both Dull and Weak</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market was slightly higher in the morning yesterday, but retraced to the same level as the previous day in the afternoon. Number 120, Gaoshan Youguang, opened at around 25 million yuan, reaching a high of 5.2 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, due to a lack of interest, the price was slightly lowered, with the final price being 4.8 million yuan. The prices of other brands were the same as the previous day, with no changes.</p>
<p>Transactions of factory-supplied silk were quiet, with prices down slightly from the previous day by 200,000 to 500,000 yuan. Yesterday's market saw 83-point evenness, C-grade silk being opened at five dan, with a five-day payment term, priced at 28.8 million yuan. Other grades only had shouting prices.

Huaqiang bedding was priced at 10.323 million yuan.

Transactions of other goods within the market were minimal, and market prices were generally stable.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Retrace Near the Close</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw increased absorption by customers from the Yangtze River region at the opening. Although it was a Saturday, credit remained loose, and transactions were quite numerous, leading to a rising market. However, as private factories released goods near the close and scattered investors heard the news and rushed to sell, confidence suddenly waned, and prices retraced. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was at 17.15 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose slightly by 50,000 yuan to 10.9 million yuan. Throughout the day, apart from 20-count Jincheng Double Globe and 16-count Guangming and 10-count Boy Scout Jinbaoxing and other coarse yarns remaining firm, the prices of other 42-count Shuiyue, 32-count Blue Phoenix, and 20-count and 16-count coarse and fine yarns of various brands retraced across the board.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of Cotton Cloth are Slow</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw scattered investors push up prices at the opening. Longtou fine cloth once rose to 443,000 yuan, but then the market softened again as people from the northern and Fujian regions sold at high prices. There were many "scalping" transactions on the trading floor, and actual sales remained slow. Finally, 12-pound brand-name fine cloth retreated to 435,000 yuan, up 2,500 yuan from the previous day. Wufu Colorful Ball, Blue Crane, Yang Crane, and other fine cloths also rose by varying amounts, from 1,000 to 2,000 to 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Other colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained stable.</p>
<p>Another report: The Textile Construction Company continued to sell white cloth as usual, listing the price of 20-count extra-fine cloth at 336,000 yuan and 4-Gentlemen Yuan Biji at 475,000 yuan. There were many applicants.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the application amount for first-category production equipment has now reached over 300 million USD. However, the amount approved by the Import Control Committee is only over 10 million USD. This shows the general strictness of the authorities in approving foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>First Batch of 100 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Shipped to Singapore</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 2nd] 100 tons of Taiwan sugar were shipped from Kaohsiung Port to Singapore for sale last month, marking the first time Taiwan sugar has entered the international market after the war. According to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation: "The second batch of 200 tons of sugar has been stored in Kaohsiung Port and will soon be shipped to Singapore by British ships." Since the Dutch East Indies have been mired in long-term war, the Javanese sugar industry has been in decline. The sugar needed by various Southeast Asian regions now also relies on Taiwan. However, Taiwan sugar is still in the restoration period. At the same time, there is a great need for sugar in mainland China. The 300 tons of sugar mentioned above are only for trial sales and are obviously difficult to supply the needs of Southeast Asia in large quantities. As for the shipment of 50,000 tons of Taiwan sugar to Japan, the company said: "The price issue has not yet been agreed upon, and there is no definite date for shipment." It is also heard that the so-called price issue is that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation believes that it should cover costs, while MacArthur's headquarters believes that the selling price is too high, which has not been resolved.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Committee Approves New Tea Purchase Method in Principle; Detailed Implementation Method to Be Studied by Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a temporary executive meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to discuss the purchase of new tea in 1947. Many people, including Shen Xirui, attended, with Shen Xirui chairing the meeting. After discussion, the tea purchase plan was finalized. However, the detailed implementation method will be studied by a subcommittee consisting of Liu Gongyun of the Central Bank, Shen Xirui of the China Trust Bureau, and Wang Botian of the China Farmers Bank, and Deng Yicheng of the China Tea Joint Operations Company and Ma Ge, consultant of the National Bank, will be hired as consultants. In addition, tea experts will be invited to jointly discuss the method. It is heard that the subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM tomorrow to discuss and formulate a method, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before implementation.</p>
<p>Farmers Bank Handles Boxed Tea Collateral</p>
<p>For 1946 boxed tea that has expired and has not been redeemed or applied for purchase by the China Trust Bureau, the Farmers Bank will handle the collateral in accordance with the decision of the Four Joint Offices and purchase it on behalf of the China Trust Bureau. According to the bank's published statistics on the handling of collateral, there are five types of boxed tea, totaling 58,894 boxes: (1) Qihong 15,049 boxes, (2) Tunlv 186 boxes, (3) Pinglv 42,958 boxes, (4) Wenhong 313 boxes, (5) Wanglv 388 boxes. The collateral amount is more than 13 billion.</p>
<p>For the sake of tea merchants, before the grades of various teas are identified, the Farmers Bank will first pay 60% of the tea price to the tea merchants, in addition to deducting the collateral amount, warehouse rent, and interest. The remaining 40% will be resolved at a meeting next Monday (4th) after the grades are identified and the tea prices of each grade are assessed. The China Trust Bureau, Farmers Bank, Tea Joint Operations Company, and Commodity Inspection Bureau will each send personnel to participate. After the grades of each grade are identified, they will be priced separately according to the standard price. It is expected that the entire work will be completed within half a month.</p>
<p>New Qi Red Tea Difficult to Sell</p>
<p>The new Qi Red Tea from Qimen, which has been in Shanghai for a long time this year, has seen continuous negotiations. However, sellers insist on selling at 3 million yuan per dan, while buyers believe it can be sold within the customs. Based on the current situation, it may be difficult to sell for the time being. Other varieties are still being inquired about by local stores and customers, especially low-grade old red tea. The opening prices are consistently firm. As for the foreign tea market, both imports and exports remain rare, and the process is extraordinarily quiet.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar Continues to Loosen</p>

<h3>CITC Establishes Taiwan Branch to Facilitate Material Exchange with Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>In order to develop its business and facilitate the exchange of materials between Taiwan Province and foreign countries, the China Import and Export Trust Corporation (CITC) has established a branch in Taiwan and appointed Zhou Shaozeng as manager. Zhou recently went to Taiwan under orders, visited Chairman Wei, contacted relevant agencies, and has returned to Shanghai to report the process to the head office. According to him: After the restoration of Taiwan Province, all production industries urgently need to develop and urgently need to import machinery, raw materials, seeds, and other items, and export various products. The CITC head office previously established an office in the province to handle the export and import of important materials. Now, in order to strengthen development, a branch has been established in Taiwan. In the future, the main business will be to handle the import and export of materials and barter trade with foreign countries in accordance with laws and regulations, and will also handle commissioned purchases of materials and property insurance and life insurance for public and private institutions to assist the government in promoting economic construction.</p>
<h3>Soap Supply Exceeds Demand, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soap market saw a decline in prices due to the upcoming distribution of Guguben soap at a price of 460,000 yuan per box, which made buyers hesitant. In addition, Huang Xiangmao soap was still being resold, and the supply in the market exceeded demand. Finally, Guguben soap fell to 473,000 yuan per box, down 7,000 yuan from the previous day. Arrow Knife soap also fell by 5,000 yuan to 470,000 yuan. The prices of other soaps such as Xiangmao, Guanghua, and Riyue also fell by varying amounts, from 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Matches and kerosene remained stable.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry Submits Five Suggestions to the Import Control Committee to Obtain Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association recently sent a letter to the Import Control Committee regarding the issue of foreign exchange allocation for tobacco leaves. The letter stated: In the past two allocations of foreign exchange for tobacco leaves, the committee assigned import firms to purchase tobacco leaves. These import firms should legally supply the various cigarette factories for reasonable orders. However, according to the association, since the previous foreign exchange allocations, few of its member cigarette factories have received reasonable orders. The remaining foreign exchange has been freely disposed of by the import firms or resold by tobacco leaf intermediaries, greatly increasing the selling price of American leaves. The following suggestions are now made for adoption: The suggestions, totaling five items, were decided at the association's recent standing council meeting and are roughly as follows: (1) Please provide the Import Control Committee with records of previous tobacco leaf foreign exchange allocations, including (A) the names of the import firms and the amount of foreign exchange allocated to each; (B) the names of the cigarette factories to which each import firm sold, the amount of foreign exchange, and the transaction price of the tobacco leaves sold. (2) From the third phase onwards, please instruct the import firms to submit the purchase contracts to the association for endorsement before submitting them to the committee for foreign exchange allocation. If there is no endorsement from the association, allocation will not be granted. (3) In the future, foreign exchange allocations for tobacco leaves should be limited to import firms with a history before the war and experience in the tobacco leaf business. (4) Foreign quotas must have rigid proportional regulations when allocating foreign exchange. For example, in the first and second phases of foreign exchange allocation for paper circles, Shanghai cigarette factories received 5/6, and foreign cigarette factories received 1/6. When estimating foreign exchange for tobacco leaves, because the quality of cigarettes produced in foreign factories is lower and requires less American leaves, the proportion can be determined lower. (5) If import firms attempt to make excessive profits when determining prices based on available foreign exchange and manufacturing plants are unwilling to order from them, the import firms' foreign exchange quota should be canceled immediately and reallocated to other import firms.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Material Distribution Problems: Various Industrial Trade Associations Attach Great Importance To It; Pan Shih-hao Says Commerce and Industry Should Not Have Friction</h3>
<p>Over forty units of various industrial trade associations in this city have compiled a summary of information regarding the distribution of industrial raw materials under import quotas. They are scheduled to send representatives to Beijing on Wednesday to appeal to relevant central authorities. Today (i.e., the 3rd) at 3:00 PM, they will convene a gathering at the Xing Wu Restaurant in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, inviting industrial leaders and prominent figures from the press to exchange views and report on developments over the past three months. It is said that the publicly released materials will point out the mistakes of the distribution office, the misunderstandings of the commercial associations, and the excessive concerns of the import industry. During the intervening period, the distribution office ostensibly waited for agreement, but was genuinely open. As a result, the industrial sector believed there was sufficient reason for confidence, while the commercial and import sectors had their own regrets. According to Mr. Pan Shih-hao, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association, in order to seek a rational distribution of industrial raw materials, consulted with the allocation office of the Import and Export Control Commission to seek coordination among various industries. Due to the favorable exchange rate settlement, they hoped that the distribution of industrial raw materials could assist the industrial sector. For the commercial sector, they planned to allocate quotas as appropriate for coordination. As for importers, they respected their position as intermediaries. The establishment of the Import Quota Industrial Raw Materials Distribution Review Committee was composed of ten directors each from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association. When meetings were held, importers and relevant commercial associations were invited to send representatives to attend, with the intention of avoiding friction among the industrial, commercial, and import sectors. In the end, the authorities only managed to distribute quotas to importers. The large proportions between industry and commerce, except for cotton, wool, tobacco, pulp, and rubber, which are relatively simple in nature and designated to be directly acquired by industry, those with more complex relationships, such as chemical raw materials, dyes, and hardware, have not yet been divided in large quantities. As a result, the heads of the associations cannot help but plan for the members of their own associations, and commercial and industrial agreements have failed. The first quarter quota, when the review committee failed to reach an agreement, was obtained by those who were quick to act. This is inconsistent with national policies and commercial ethics. I advocate that industrial raw materials should be obtained by industry, and if industry and commerce encounter imported goods that should be distributed, the government should clearly specify the proportions to ensure fairness and avoid friction, he said. Mr. Shen also pointed out that legitimate and reasonable importers must have their value of existence and have meaning beneficial to international trade. The industrial sector has never completely denied that.</p>
<p>Fir Wood Stagnation</p>
<p>The market price of fir wood is still difficult to boost, stagnating at 600 yuan. The market price of foreign pine is also stagnant. Due to the stability of general timber prices for many days, it is difficult to decline. If not subject to unexpected stimulation, it will likely hover for many days.</p>

<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>A Traitor Who Acted as an Accomplice to the Enemy During the War of Resistance Plans to Apply for Parole</p>
<p>Editor: A friend, Mr. Jia, was detained in 1945 after the victory for the crime of being a traitor. In April 1946, he was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the court. The time since his detention has exceeded one year and two months, and he now intends to apply for parole. There are three legal questions, and I pray for answers. (1) According to the provisions of Article 77, Paragraph 1, Proviso of the Criminal Law, this shall not apply to those whose execution of fixed-term imprisonment is less than one year. Now that Mr. Jia has been detained for more than one year, should the detention time be deducted, or should he be able to apply only after another year from the date of the judgment? (2) According to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of the same article, "If the execution period in the preceding paragraph encounters the situation in Article 46, it shall be calculated based on the remaining term of imprisonment." Does the so-called "remaining term of imprisonment" refer to the remaining term of imprisonment at the time of the judgment? Now that Jia has been sentenced to two years and six months, deducting the one year and two months of detention, should he serve half of the remaining term of imprisonment, that is, eight months, before he can be paroled? (3) In summary, what procedures should Mr. Jia use to apply for parole? Sincerely, Shen Junke</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Jiang Pingfan] (1) The provisions of Article 77, Paragraph 1, Proviso of the Criminal Law, "This shall not apply to those whose execution of fixed-term imprisonment is less than one year," refer to the fact that this situation cannot be applied for parole. Jia has been sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the court, so this proviso does not apply. (2) The parole term should be calculated from the date of the judgment. (3) Jia's situation should be executed from the date of the judgment. After one-half of the remaining term has been served, the prison director can submit it to the highest judicial administrative authority for permission for parole.</p>

<h3>Mei Baek-ki Anniversary Ceremony</h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>——『Smart children are often thin, and beautiful daughters are prone to aging.』</p>
<p>For the same reason, great musical geniuses are also prone to die young: Beethoven was deaf at the age of 32, half of his genius was destroyed, Mozart, as well as China's Huang Zi, Xian Xinghai, and Nie Er, were all short-lived geniuses, with such rich musical wisdom, they passed away in middle age.</p>
<p>On this day last year (August 3, 1946), Shanghai lost a Far Eastern musical master. He came to Shanghai in the year the First World War ended and has been serving Shanghai's musical culture ever since. He made many people in Shanghai have the habit of going to concerts, and he had a good influence on many emerging musicians and music school students in Shanghai. Today, the only symphony orchestra in Shanghai is the result of this musical master's efforts for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>This musician who has already returned to another world is Mr. Mei Baek-ki (Maestro Mario Pace), who is most familiar to Shanghai music listeners. He was the bald old conductor who occasionally appeared at the symphony concerts in the Lyceum Theatre after the fall of the Shanghai Concession and was warmly welcomed by the masses. (At that time, Mr. Mei had given up his position as conductor due to the Japanese forced to host the symphony orchestra, just like Toscanini, who refused to cooperate with the fascists and left.)</p>
<p>Although he was not a short-lived genius (he died at the age of 68), in Shanghai, where musical food is so scarce, he did not have the opportunity to give us more artistic achievements, which is regrettable and regrettable!</p>
<p>In 1878, he was born in Italy. At the age of seven, he began to learn piano in a famous musical school, and he began to perform publicly at the age of eleven. This is not surprising in Italy, the land of music, but such precocious success shows his future in any case. However, his father opposed him dedicating himself entirely to music. This is the same difficult experience as many famous musicians.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mei Baek-ki complained in his "Autobiography":</p>
<p>『At the age of fourteen, one day, I sold all my books and only valuables—an old large watch, got some lire (Italian currency), and escaped from Napoli to Rome.』</p>
<p>Going to Rome was to visit Professor Sgambati, one of the last students of Liszt, a famous pianist. He visited the professor, but was blocked by the servant: "The professor does not want to see anyone without a letter of introduction."</p>
<p>After countless blows in Rome, the lonely and poor young Mei Baek-ki finally won the Liszt Prize in the international music competition in 1895.</p>
<p>Soon, with the appreciation of the modern opera composer Puccini (Prcini) and the influence of the modern conductor Toscanini, his skills improved rapidly. His unrestrained personality made him uneasy with "quiet". In 1902, he decided to travel around the world, and at the end of 1918, he arrived in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the disease kept him here. The following year, he became the conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, and the orchestra was enriched as a result. Under his strict training and management, the achievements of the orchestra over the past 20 years have been praised by Chinese and foreigners alike. Last year, the municipal symphony orchestra held a memorial concert for Mei Baek-ki. Many enthusiastic listeners missed Mr. Mei's skills and achievements, and tears welled up in their eyes. Several famous musicians who played also showed their inner pain. I will never forget this!</p>
<p>The easiest thing to make people think and chew carefully is Mei's difficult experience, and what Shanghai music listeners yearn for most is his management of the orchestra's affairs and his supervision of skills. This is what friends in the music industry will never forget.</p>
<p>Today, the orchestra is managed by the Conservatory of Music and conducted by Professor Fu Hua. Although the number of performers has decreased a little, we believe that it will definitely be able to inherit the previous achievements and glory!</p>
<h3>Mei Baek-ki's Posture of Conducting the Orchestra</h3>
<p>Brother Xian Ou painted a picture for the monthly magazine "Free Talk" edited by Yu, saying "Waiting for the River to Clear" A zhangren (wife's father) leaned on a cane to face the river and wrote this poem to thank him Lü Baihua</p>
<p>Beautiful is this magnificent appearance, It has not been cleared for thousands of years, If an inch of glue can be used to manage it, A smile is not light, Vainly waiting hurts people's lives, Competing currents confuse the world's soldiers, The滔滔(boundless) affairs of the past and present, Leaning on a cane, it is difficult to calm down!</p>
<h3>Two Poems on Zhou Huaimin's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Zhang Daqian</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Spring clouds are so beautiful, Spring water and moon are tinkling, Dragonflies flutter up and down, Idly chasing the fishing line in the wind.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Two guests go to find poetry, Beautiful sentences suddenly fill the scroll; The setting sun fades on the western mountain, I don't realize it's late on the way home.</p>
<h3>A Gift to Painter Zhou Huaimin</h3>
<p>— Yang Pingmiao</p>
<p>Yunlin's style originated from the same hometown, Wandering the world, but heartbroken; A painting of the west wind rustling, Everyone says Zhou Lutang. (Huaimin is good at painting Lutang, people at that time called him Zhou Lutang)</p>
<h3>Painting Techniques</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>When a national painter completes a painting, they often inscribe a title or add poems and prose to the painting. This is called inscription. Originally, painters of the Tang and Song dynasties did not pay much attention to inscription. Some paintings only have a name written in the trees and stones or in the gaps, or even absolutely no name; adding poems and words is even more out of the question. However, later some painters who were good at poetry and prose, especially literati painters, after completing a painting, not only took the title of the day, but also added some poems and prose to set off the meaning of the day. Therefore, later some buyers of paintings actually used the number of inscriptions (including those inscribed by others) to determine the price of the painting, or even its authenticity. Therefore, in recent years, in order to meet the requirements of determining the price of paintings, painters have even included "add five for long inscriptions" in the price list.</p>
<p>Not every painter can create painting titles. Therefore, "Three Friends of Winter", "Dry Wood, Bamboo, and Stone", "Mountain Dwelling Talking", "Autumn Mountain Red Trees", "Layered Peaks and Verdant", "Listening to Pine and Watching Waterfall", "Wealthy and Auspicious Goat", "Lone Fishing in Cold River", "Carrying Qin and Visiting Friends", "Monks Returning Deep in White Clouds", etc. are very common. And the poems and words added are often not newly created by the painter because of the painting, but are copied and used repeatedly. In order to supply and demand, speculative booksellers have even compiled ancient and modern painting poems, categorized and printed them into volumes, to provide those who cannot write poetry with a secret treasure for painting on demand.</p>
<p>Inscription should be precise and appropriate in lightness, not persistent and able to harmonize with the painting materials, and it should also express the author's identity. The title should not contain vulgar elements. I have seen a painter who works in a certain institution paint a painting for his superior, and the inscription is: "× Public Shangshu (Secretary of State) Master Famouly Painted under supervision, subordinate ××× respectfully painted, respectfully seeking grace". Such 背辭(reciting phrases), is equivalent to submitting a formal document, leaving the scope of art. Moreover, taking the Minister of the Republic of China as the Shangshu of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the times are upside down, which is even more ridiculous. There is also a painter who made a landscape painting and actually inscribed: "The sound of machines and the moon in Meidian, the traces of dogs and the frost on the small bridge", with wrong words everywhere, he should be spanked. There is also a female painter who wrote a plum blossom branch and inscribed: "Occasionally learn Yunlin's stone method, so admire Yu Ke's new style. A piece of green and lush color, actually two 斜　". Using bamboo and stone titles for plum blossoms is really like putting a horse's head to a donkey's mouth. Nothing else, not seeking thorough understanding, thinking about expressing the three excellences of Qingcai, so that Zhang Guan Li Dai has this loss.</p>
<p>Qiu Shizhou was good at painting but not good at poetry. He was self-aware. Most of his paintings were signed with simple titles such as Qiu Yingzhi or Qiu Ying Shifu Hua, and sometimes he added the year and year only. Everyone has their own abilities and inabilities. They should give full play to their strengths and hide their weaknesses. Those who are good at painting do not need to be good at poetry, just as poets do not need to know how to paint. Poetry is already an independent art. If painters cannot recite, why should they squeeze into the ranks of poets? If you don't consider your virtue or ability, and you force yourself to make a rhyme and inscribe it, it will not only be useless, but also harmful.</p>
<p>The ancient masters of inscription often had superb artistic conception. For example, Shitao inscribed a painting axis of plum, stone, and daffodils, saying: "The two gentlemen have the same posture and rhyme, and they are released at the same time, and they are suitable for water. Although Jiangsha pots and stones, chanting and appreciation may be different, a kind of clear fragrance and distant rhyme, far out of the dust, is called a double wall, why be ashamed. Today's people in social interactions often talk about臭味(common interests), alas, how many people can be so飘然标映(outstanding)! This is using the day to talk about life, the meaning is profound, and completely out of the 頭巾氣(pedantry). Jin Dongxin inscribed ink bamboo, saying: "I paint bamboo without painting stones, what is difficult with stones? The color is too ancient, and the snow is used as a feibai, which is good. If you accumulate moss with rain dots, you are not willing to paint it. Painting bamboo is suitable for fatigue, thin and long-lived, and naturally full of wind and frost. Meng Zhuang's ten-circumference bloated tree, I feel lazy to face the drawings, I am afraid that the guests will ridicule me, because I am a meat-eating phase." Using humorous words to explain the principle of painting bamboo and stones is by no means something that people who are ignorant can imitate.</p>
<p>Also, when asking someone to inscribe a poem on a painting, you should consider whether that person can inscribe the painting, because some people who are good at poetry and prose cannot inscribe the painting, so there should be necessary deliberation and selection. Otherwise, a good painting will be inscribed incorrectly, which will detract from the color of the entire painting, and leave a bad impression on the viewers. Putting feces on the Buddha's head is counterproductive. However, the subtleties in it are not easy to explain in detail. Insiders can tell at a glance. Moreover, because of the people who inscribe the paintings and poems, you can also know the relationship between the painters or collectors in the literary and artistic circles. At the same time, you can also know the level of their own choice in the literary and artistic circles. Insiders and outsiders are also distinguished here.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the year of inscription should adopt the Republic of China era, which is suitable for the times. Ye Xia'an has already implemented this point, which is worthy of admiration.</p>
<h3>Cubist Painting</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Cubism appeared in the history of painting in the 20th century, already 20 or 30 years ago. So Cubism has become a kind of classic, and it is really an interesting thing to start studying it again now.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here is, what kind of achievements does Cubism have in the history of modern painting? At the same time, I will introduce several writers who are in a leading position in Cubism.</p>
<p>Generally, the origin of Cubism is considered to be Paul Cezanne. This view is naturally not wrong. However, this is only a driving force for the occurrence of Cubism, and it cannot be considered as the origin. Because Cubism is not only an experiment in painting that George Braque first accepted Cezanne's theory, but P. Picasso is a writer who is a precursor. That is to say, Picasso himself has evidence of elements other than Cezanne. He accidentally studied black sculptures and discovered a principle of modeling, and applied the black modeling expression method; therefore, when it comes to the origin of Cubism, on the one hand, it is true that it cannot be ignored that it was inspired by Cezanne's works, and on the other hand, it was greatly influenced by black art, which is more appropriate.</p>
<p>In 1908, this kind of work began to be presented at the Paris Modern Art Exhibition. Braque's cubic expression starting from Cezanne appeared, and Picasso's cubic description learned from black sculptures was also published. At that time, H. Matisse, who saw this cubic style of painting, mocked and said: "Cubist painting! The more you play, the more novel it becomes." Unexpectedly, the Cubist movement has since swept across Paris and even Europe.</p>
<p>After that, they exhibited in various places as a declaration of the Cubist movement to foreigners. At that time, in the preface of the great critic He Bolinai in the publication attached to the exhibition, the title (Cubisme et Cubiste) has been used.</p>
<p>The novel Cubist movement has concentrated the strong attention of people in the new era, and at the same time, it has been greatly oppressed by the old feudal writers. In short, the success of the Cubist movement as a revolutionary of world painting should be attributed to the cooperation and efforts of Braque and Picasso.</p>
<p>Here, I will try to give a brief account of the recent art of Braque, and at the same time discuss the achievements of Cubism in modern painting:</p>
<p>Observing the situation when Cubism started, its object is to explore the outside world, but it is only transforming the form of objects. That is, in the era when it accepted the influence of Cezanneism and black art, Cubism once adopted a cubic deformation description method. Then, with the deepening of research, although the analysis of natural objects is carried out, it gradually deviates from natural objects and seeks objects on the screen itself. At this time, it is no longer about handling the lifelikeness of natural products, but the screen itself is being researched as an object. Therefore, we call it "screen object".</p>
<p>This attitude is to make painting the purest thing. Painting should start from the entire book surface and continue with the composition of the screen. This method, at least, can be said to have been discovered by Braque and gradually purified. Therefore, Braque's cubic expression, which started from Cezanneism, gradually deviated from the initial deformation description and progressed to the formation of theatrical scenes.</p>
<p>After 1930, Braque can be said to be pursuing this kind of composition on the screen to the extreme. And this so-called composition problem in painting has become a central problem in modern painting.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 364</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Enough!" I was getting annoyed by his rambling.</p>
<p>"I just overheard this while passing by the 'Temporary Office': I heard someone was inquiring about 'Pingming the Monk,' asking why he hadn't registered..." The big fool stopped there, his gaze already shifting to Dingyuan.</p>
<p>I was somewhat baffled, but then I saw Dingyuan already standing up, a wry smile on his face. "I need to go take a walk and come back. If I don't, I'm afraid those bastards might cause trouble and even come here." As he spoke, he picked up his monk's robes and the odds and ends.</p>
<p>Only then did I realize that Dingyuan had taken the name "Pingming" here, but he had to go register every day. The short devils treated him like a "semi-free prisoner," showing how difficult and dangerous his situation was. He probably didn't even know it himself. Seeing him about to leave, and not knowing the actual situation, I didn't want to insist he stay. Suddenly, I remembered the food the big fool had bought, so I immediately gestured for the big fool to open the package.</p>
<p>"It's alright," Dingyuan said to me, knowing I wanted him to eat before leaving. "I still have rations on my side, and I'll be back in an hour at most. Save some of the good stuff for me..." As he spoke, he was already dressed and ready, raising his hand to us in farewell, dragging his heavy steps, swaying as he walked out the door.</p>
<p>The big fool was surprisingly capable. Once the package was opened, inside, besides the food, were cups, plates, chopsticks, and dishes. Among the food were two large braised chickens, twenty or thirty tall steamed buns, many braised eggs, a thermos bottle, probably filled with boiled water, a bottle of wine, and several aged, wrinkled pears.</p>
<p>While eating this spring picnic-style lunch, I finished the story of Tsurumi. I didn't hold back the fact that Tsurumi was being recalled to Tokyo for training. I also explained the top-secret message received last night from Tokyo, which instructed us to prepare to go to , all were explained. I also told Yaoqun and Little Tiger that W. and I had been extremely anxious since receiving their first report, and that W. had specifically sent me to Tianjin. Upon receiving the second report, he had told me to abandon the rescue work I had started in Tianjin and rush here, preparing to risk my life to sneak across the "no man's land" of Nankou and go to Zhangbei to search for their traces. Fortunately, they were still lingering here, and fortunately, we had met again. It could be said that it was half human effort, half luck. I felt immense joy, and W. and Tokyo were undoubtedly relieved after receiving the telegram I had just sent.</p>
<p>"It's all a delay in the telegram!" Yaoqun said, tears in his eyes but a smile on his face. "Just one less communication tool, and no reliable personnel for transportation; it just so happened..." Yaoqun stopped there, glancing at Little Tiger again. "Tiger brother got separated again, otherwise..."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Little Tiger's whole body trembled, as if suddenly electrocuted. I couldn't help but laugh. Little Tiger was even more embarrassed when he saw me laughing. I thought about Little Tiger's two reports and his eccentric temperament. After arriving in Beiping, I don't know why he refused to report to headquarters in person. Sneaking around, he produced that slanted "official document" and then ran off here in a puff of smoke. If Yaoqun knew about this, he would scold him severely. I thought Little Tiger definitely wouldn't want me to burst that bubble, so I let it go with a laugh.</p>

<h3>Heatwave Strikes Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Haifeng</p>
<p>On July 27th, the temperature in Shanghai reached 99.9 degrees. According to the records of the Central Meteorological Observatory, it reached 104 degrees on July 12th, 1934, so this was far from the hottest weather. The average temperature for the past 73 years is 94.8 degrees, and 99.9 degrees has already broken the highest record of the average Shanghai temperature in 73 years.</p>
<p>Shanghai has been in a heatwave for the past week, and the heatwave has not receded. Although there have been several thunderstorms to wash it away, the intensity has not decreased.</p>
<p>From July 23rd to the 31st, the temperature records in Shanghai are: 23rd: 98.5 degrees, 24th: 98.9 degrees, 25th: 96.4 degrees, 26th: 90 degrees, 27th: 99.9 degrees, 28th: 99 degrees, 29th: 99.8 degrees, 30th: 93 degrees, 31st: 98.8 degrees.</p>
<p>The difference in temperature between these nine days is at most five degrees, and the average temperature is around 98 degrees, which shows that Shanghai has been hit by a heatwave.</p>
<p>According to the Meteorological Observatory, the reason why Shanghai is so hot this year is because the humid and hot air from the North Pacific and the dry and hot air from southwestern China are covering it. Although local thunderstorms are prone to occur, the heatwave will not decrease after the rain, and the hot period will not be too short.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, everyone had another new hope for the weather, that is, the typhoon would land along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and it was expected that Shanghai would be hit by this typhoon around July 31st or August 1st. If the typhoon washes over, the weather may be much cooler, but the Meteorological Observatory announced on the 30th that this typhoon had moved northeast to southern Japan on the afternoon of the 30th, with a small and weak wind rate of only 25 to 30 miles per hour. Therefore, this typhoon has formed a temperate storm, and its activity will disappear after it reaches land.</p>
<p>In other words, Shanghai will no longer be affected by any typhoons.</p>
<p>If you want to make a judgment on the weather in August, then-: the weather in Shanghai will be even hotter, and it will not be cool for a while.</p>

<h3>Curing Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Do you still remember that sleepless night, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep? Maybe you regret eating a bowl of wontons before going to bed, or regret taking a nap during the day, which hindered normal sleep.</p>
<p>But you are wrong. Professor Nathaniel Kleitman of the University of Chicago, with 25 years of experience in studying sleep problems, knows that how much you eat for dinner, a snack before bed, or a nap during the day has no adverse effect on nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>Professor Kleitman, hailed as the person who knows the most about sleep problems in the world, is 52 years old, with a head of black hair, and is also the only person in the world who works 24 hours a day. After he goes to bed, his research work does not stop. His bed is equipped with a set of sensitive recording instruments that record his heartbeat, breathing, brainwave activity, and body movements during sleep.</p>
<p>Professor Kleitman's research achievements over the past 25 years have broken the common misconceptions about sleep.</p>
<p>For example, ordinary people think that everyone should have eight hours of sleep every day. Professor Kleitman's research results show that the amount of sleep needed by each person is different. Some people have to sleep for nine hours, but for some people, five hours is enough.</p>
<p>In Professor Kleitman's experiments, he himself had not slept for 180 consecutive hours. Apart from a decrease in work efficiency, there were no permanent adverse reactions.</p>
<p>People always toss and turn while sleeping. This kind of turning only makes people sleep more soundly. Someone once warned not to sleep on the left side, but it doesn't matter which side you sleep on, because you have to turn at least a dozen times in one night.</p>
<p>Ordinary people feel that they should not eat before going to bed. In fact, after many experiments, eating a sandwich or drinking milk before going to bed has no effect on sleep. As for drinking coffee, Professor Kleitman has three answers. First, many people drink coffee before going to bed and can still sleep well. Second, some people are stimulated by coffee and do not sleep well. The third type of person, they just think in their hearts that they are stimulated by coffee and cannot fall asleep. The reason why they think this way is because they have repeatedly heard people say this.</p>
<p>What is sleep? Professor Kleitman's answer is very simple. He said: "Sleep is everyone's routine, repeated every 24 hours. Because people can't stay awake all the time without sleeping."</p>
<p>An infant wakes up only because he feels too cold or too hot, or the diaper is wet, or he is hungry. Once he is fed. After changing the diaper and feeling comfortable, he falls asleep again. Gradually growing up, he develops the habit of working and playing during the day and sleeping at night.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all method for treating insomnia. Some people need a little exercise before going to bed, some need to take a hot bath, some need records to hypnotize them, and some need to count numbers or recite the names of the capitals of the world. You should use whichever method works for you. But never take sleeping pills.</p>
<p>According to Professor Kleitman's experiments, to sleep soundly, it is best to go to bed at a fixed time every night and not often be uncertain. At the same time, don't be nervous before going to bed. If you don't sleep well, go to bed earlier. Because people who go to bed early sleep longer and sleep better.</p>
<h3>Customs After Marriage in Europe and America</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Mengwu</p>
<p>In Europe and the United States, it is customary to send out invitations to guests for a feast on the same day of the same month of the second year after the wedding, to celebrate the event. For example, the silver wedding of the former British Emperor Edward was once widely circulated. In recent decades, those "the moon is better abroad" people in our country have also followed suit. However, most of them may only know the two wedding customs of gold and silver weddings. The rest may not have heard of it. Here, I will record what I know and publish it for the "chasing foreigners" celebrities and elegant scholars to imitate one by one, so that there will be no more regrets of "pearls left behind in the sea":</p>
<p>The first year is "cotton";</p>
<p>The second year is "paper";</p>
<p>The third year is "leather";</p>
<p>The fifth year is "wood";</p>
<p>The seventh year is "wool";</p>
<p>The tenth year is "tin";</p>
<p>The twelfth is "silk" or "linen";</p>
<p>The fifteenth is "crystal";</p>
<p>The twentieth is "porcelain";</p>
<p>The twenty-fifth year is "silver";</p>
<p>The thirtieth year is "pearl";</p>
<p>The fortieth year is "gem";</p>
<p>The fiftieth year is "gold";</p>
<p>The seventy-fifth year is "diamond".</p>
<p>From cotton to crystal to gold and diamond! - It should be taken to mean that the couple can be of one heart after marriage, and the older they get, the stronger and longer they last.</p>
<h3>News Clippings</h3>
<p>— Xiaozhu Edits</p>
<p>Prostitute Training Class</p>
<p>The Changsha Municipal Police Department gathered more than two hundred prostitutes in the city and gave them military management and reconnaissance training at the Guangming Grand Theater every morning, and instilled common sense of hygiene. The prostitutes who knew a little about it had a good understanding of the cultivation of this technique. This first prostitute training class has been completed. On the morning of the 25th of last month, a graduation certificate awarding ceremony was held at the Keyuan Lvping Shuchang in the city. The heads of various agencies were invited to perform speeches to show encouragement.</p>
<p>Supplements to the Hunan Disaster</p>
<p>The disaster in Hunan Province is terrible. The villagers take their families to wander around and have no means of living. They sell their wives and children to make a living. On the streets of Lingling County, a villager sold two sons. The price of the older son was three buckets of white rice, and the price of the younger son was two buckets of white rice. Also, in the Yangyang city, a strong man took his wife to sell. A passer-by "traded" for 20,000 yuan in legal tender. However, it was discovered that the woman still had an infant less than two months old. The strong man insisted on selling them together. In desperation, Xingba added 3,000 yuan to buy the infant together.</p>
<p>Unofficial History of Grain Collection</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Grain Administration recently received a report from the grain collection personnel of the four counties of Qiongzui, Dase, Pujiang, and Pengshan, saying that the township chiefs of these four counties embezzled as much as 30,000 to 40,000 shi of grain, and the least was also more than several thousand shi. This batch of Zheng Township Chiefs colluded with local bullies, and their momentum was huge. Before the grain supervision group arrived, they intimidated them. After they arrived, they set up machine guns all over the streets and alleys to show their "welcome", trying to prevent the clearing of grain from previous years. The township chiefs had already avoided seeing them, so the grain collection personnel had no way to contact them, let alone clear the grain.</p>
<p>Seven-Year-Old Addict</p>
<p>The Taiyuan Police Department arrested a petty thief named Wang Gensheng on the 20th of last month. According to Wang Gensheng's confession: He is twelve years old this year, from Pingyao, and has been imprisoned twice for theft, and confessed that he has been addicted to opium for five years and needs to smoke about 40,000 yuan of opium every day. He has twice apprenticed to a master to specialize in petty theft. There are many children in their teens in the same industry who gather in cinemas and other places at a scheduled time every day.</p>

<p>Trouble Caused by Watching a Play (Guangxu 22nd Year, December 26th)</p>
<p>On the 27th of last month, a misunderstanding occurred between the police and military police in front of the Jindu Grand Theater, causing a conflict. They pointed guns at each other, as if facing a great enemy. Fifty years ago, incidents also occurred in Shanghai theaters where soldiers caused trouble, had verbal altercations with the audience, and even beat people to death.</p>
<p>"Recently, the Sha Ning boats in Nanshi have hired opera students from the Liyuan in Hubai to perform together at the Nanhui Hall. There are crowds of spectators. Although the patrol bureau has sent soldiers to suppress them, there are still inevitable quarrels. The day before yesterday, in the midst of loud gongs and drums, someone from a certain foundry had a verbal altercation with a soldier from a certain camp over a dispute over seats. They disagreed and twisted and beat each other. At that time, there were many soldiers, so the people from the foundry were defeated and suffered heavy losses. They then sent someone back to the foundry to gather sixty or seventy people to question them and block the way outside the hall. They beat people when they saw them, so the soldiers were unable to resist and suffered losses instead. Four soldiers were seriously injured. Someone then went to the camp to report. The camp official ordered the injured soldiers to be carried to the Yuanlai foundry. It was a lot of chaos, and I don't know how it will end."</p>
<h3>The Film World This Week</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>The Vulgar and Boring "Peach Blossoms Still Smile in the Spring Breeze"</p>
<p>"Peach Blossoms Still Smile in the Spring Breeze" attempts to use the theme of comedy to express the free love and married life of young men and women, but the two main characters, Zhang Ping and Du Shafei, who appear in the story, the former is a frivolous and boring young man, and the latter is just a broad-minded young lady who inexplicably gets angry. The two people are put together by the director in a nonsensical way to perform this "comedy" story. This script is vulgar and boring enough.</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan's first time acting in such a play, the results are still somewhat satisfactory. When Bai Yun's Zhang Ping appears on the film, wearing a floral tie, a floral suit, and an airplane head, he is a complete rascal, and his twisted state is disgusting. Wang Ban has no chance to perform in the play.</p>
<p>The director's handling of the play is loose and disorganized.</p>
<p>Comedy Film "Champagne Lovebirds"</p>
<p>Also a comedy film, "Champagne Lovebirds" has its success. The whole play connects the whole story with a bottle of champagne. Naturally, a love story is also inserted in the middle, but the screenwriter's skills are commendable. He allows this bottle of champagne to be obtained and lost several times, writing in a meticulous and humorous way. The audience's emotions always shift with the bottle of champagne until the champagne is thrown towards the newly launched aircraft carrier, and only then is it easily satisfied. This cannot but be said to be the success of this play.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Lei Mirun and Olivia Harvard have extremely excellent and sophisticated acting skills.</p>
<p>John Ford's "Blood Sea Flying Thunder"</p>
<p>John Ford is one of Hollywood's excellent directors and also a familiar figure to the audience. This "Blood Sea Flying Thunder" is his work. The content describes the heroic resistance story of a small team of naval patrol boats in the Philippine Islands after the outbreak of the Pacific War. Many wonderful sea battle scenes under the treatment of dehan Ford are extremely moving. It is a pity that there are a few small segments in the middle that are more scattered, but we can still see the director's majestic courage and organizational depiction.</p>
<p>Robert Montgomery, who has returned from retirement, plays a team leader in the film. His calm and sophisticated acting skills are still undiminished. John Wayne is serious and competent in his role.</p>
<p>Singing Film "Lilac Mountain"</p>
<p>"Lilac Mountain" is the first singing film co-starred by the king of singers, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour. Here, the screenwriter has arranged a relaxed and lively story, several variety-style singing dramas, the scenery behind the small theater, and a not-so-annoying love triangle, all of which bring relaxation and humor to the audience. Especially the singing scene at the end, where the stage and the audience are all in one, is really moving.</p>
<p>As entertainment, then this film is worth watching. Dorothy Lamour's change of style is still commendable, and Marjorie Landeau's Zhen is especially lovely.</p>
<p>The "Human Voice Darling" Is Still Worth a Look</p>
<p>This is a script adapted from a long novel. The story is extremely routine. A jealous husband has a beautiful wife. He murders two people and is finally exposed by another doctor and buried in a fire pit. The director's handling of the entire film focuses on psychological depiction, so the entire play is able to grasp the tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>The female lead, Hedy Lamarr, is famous in the film industry for her beauty. Her acting is still commendable, but her recitation is poor. In addition, Paul Lukas's results are indeed above George Brent. This is a Hollywood hard-core actor.</p>
<p>The photography technology of this film is excellent.</p>
<p>"Night in Paradise" and "A Thousand and One Nights"</p>
<p>These two films both boast to the audience with Western mythological stories and magnificent color films. But apart from some technical tricks in photography, there are really no new tricks. And those colorful colors are also quite vulgar.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the male and female protagonists of "A Song to Remember" are assigned to be the protagonists of the two films "Night in Paradise" and "A Thousand and One Nights".</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>Abbott and Costello's "Here Come the Co-Eds" is one of the better comedies recently performed. In addition, James Cagney's "The Fighting 69th" and Joan Haig, Jenny Glenn's "Youth Singing" are all re-screened films.</p>
