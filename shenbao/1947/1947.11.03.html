<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾即將決定美國是否應續予中國援助，以鞏固其中央政府，制止共產黨擴張。此事在本月下句馬氏赴倫敦出席外長會議以前，或即可決定。據官方今日宣聲，中國間題爲一大緊急間題。華盛頃方面曾接獲報吿，南京美國當局認爲次吏中國免受巨災，必須在明年初即予蔣主席及其堅苦奮鬥之軍隊以援助。馬歇爾已令其高級幕僚及顧間人員覓取方法，予中國政府以有限制之財政及經濟援助，如救濟物資等，並增強國軍實力。馬氏前以赴魯門總統特使資格留華服務，自返國以後，即將對華援助保留在最低限度，僅於數月前供給子彈一批。美國之限制援助，係遵守此間所謂「無舉動」政策，以待國民政府本身之改組，將更多權力交與馬氏所認為穩健派之手。此等領袖一部份雖已任職，惟據國務院所得印象，認爲並無實權。馬氏需要中國政府之解放，其主要目的仍未達到。實際上共方向且略相反。本星期初中國政府曾取締民主同盟。美國常局所注重者，似爲民主同盟中國共產黨以外之惟一眞正勢力。目前美國對華政策，與美。蘇間之衝突牽涉頗深，此爲一基木事實，惟此間尙未獲得中共由蘇聯積極供應或受指揮之正式證據。美國所考慮之一點，即欲限制其對華援助於某種形式，俾不致引起美·蘇兩國在中國公然鬥爭。馬歇爾對於中國局勢之研究，大部份係根據最近由　　邁提出之調查報吿。此項報吿書鎖閉在國務院保險箱中，標明極度秘密，但在官方心理中創不稍疑慮，相信魏氏提議由美國給與中國以廣大之援助，或且較馬歇爾與國務院此時所願與者更爲廣大。</p>

<h3>愼重首次普選</h3>
<p>國大代表與立委監委的選舉，不久卽將次第舉行；上海市選委會明日開會，審查競選國大代表人的資格，政黨提名的名單，可望於六日公佈；由此足見政府籌備選舉的積極了。但是這一次的選舉，是國民大會制定憲法後破天荒的第一次，共得失不僅有關我國政治今後的民主作風，而且我國憲政的前途，也將視這次選舉而定，所謂「作事愼於始謀」，這次選舉是我國政治走向民主的第一步，不滑雪特別愼重辦理。這次上海市參議會將閉幕時，也通過「請政府特別審愼辦理大選」的臨時動議，陶參議員百川代表全體參議員致答辭時，也說：『上海不久就要選舉國大代表立法委員和監察委員，我們希望自己能完成一面平面鏡的任務，才能希望他們做一架顯微鏡和望遠鏡』。所以我們為欲使中國的政治眞正能走上民主的坦途，不得不希望這次大選能夠愼重辦理，樹立一個民主政治的新作風。</p>
<p>第一，我們要使全國上下，大農家都會珍惜和愛護這部以血肉換來的憲法。淸末的立憲運動和民國初年的制憲史，姑置勿論，卽以從立法院開始起草憲法的經過而言，這一部憲法的誕生，不知絞盡了多少法政學者的心血？以經歷的時間而論，從民國二十二年二月起，至三十六年元旦公佈，歷十五年之久，為任何一國的憲法所不及。所以　蔣主席將中國憲法草案提交國民大會審議時會說：『今天所提出的這部憲法草案？可以說是五十年來全國軍民先烈以血淚籌成的。』記得國民大會的召開，也不知經過多少的波折，旣定召開的日期，也一再展延，共歷五次之多，到了最後一次，仍未能如期舉行，而不得不再延期三天舉行，從視野乳可以看出這部憲法締造之不易。現在我們旣有了從艱難中產生的一部憲法，想處之不易，一字一句，都是辛苦和心血。豈能不特別愛惜！再從這部憲法的內容看來，它是在許多專家學者精細縝密研究和再三審議之下制成的，不僅有遠大的理想，迎合戰後世界的新潮流；而且又能顧及國內政治的實際情形及社會的需要；老實說，這是戰後世界上最新的一部憲法，我們豈能任其成為具文而不加以珍惜？但是憲法貴在實行，我們愛護憲法之義，端在使這一部憲法所規定的條款。都能實現。國大是行憲的唯一機關，對於選舉國大代表，怎能不愼重將事呢？</p>
<p>第二，我們要使全國上下都能明瞭我國政治民主化應從學習中求進步，目下尙在開始學習的階段。我國廚具工的政治思想，雖然充滿了民主的思想，但因歷代的政治，都是一種開明的君主政體，所以迄無民主政體的出現，時至今日，我們才有一部民主憲法，我們才能實施憲政：大多數人民對於民主憲政的運用，都不十分瞭然，更談不到運用自如；尤其對於選舉，不知為何物？在有選舉權的人民，旣不知選舉權的可貴而珍視這一票：在競選的人，也往往不知以政策綱來博得選民的同情，而欲以金錢酒菜來換取選民的投票。這種現象在民主先進國家固然不可避免；但是我們終希望我國政治能迎頭趕上支產，千萬不要發生這種弊端。但為避免這種流弊起見，各黨實行政黨提名制，國民黨對於黨內同志競選。採取圈定候選人的辦法，不許本黨的同志自由競選。依照國民黨的一貫精神，向來採取民主集權制，黨員對於黨的決策，在未決定之前，可以自由發表意見，參加討論；但至決定之後，黨員唯有服從。最近有少數的黨員，因不滿於國定辦法，而主張自由競選，我們認為這種見解是錯誤的，所謂民主政治，一定要經過政黨的關係，才能顯示出民意的向背，以美國國會議員的選舉而論，人選投票只知有黨，不知有人，共和黨的候選人在紐約州競選成功，是共和黨的勝利，而非候選人個人的成功。如若聽任一黨的同志自由競選，不僅足以削弱黨的勢力，而且足以引起黨內的爭執。不過我們對於負責圈定的主管人員，也希望他們辦事一秉大公無私的態度，分別審核競選人的資力反其在當地的聲望，以此為取舍的標凖。同時我們還希望主管人員能不參加競選為原則，以免有「自己圈定自己」之嫌。</p>
<p>第三，我們要使全國所有競選人認淸目前中國的政治，所謂「萬方多難」，確已到了最嚴重的時期；今後的一切希望，都寄託在行憲的國民大會立法院及監察院：至大選之後，國民大會能否與民更始，使全國面目一新，實為新任國大代表立法委員暨監察委員的責任，凡是現在熱烈參加競選的人，都應該在狂熱裏保持冷靜，反躬自省一下，競選的動機何在？是不是為國為民？抑或僅為了個人的顯要？我們不反對有力者參加競選，俾負起建國的任務，但不贊成專為了個人的出路而參加競選，以達到個人的欲望。不過痁第三者的地位，對於他們內心的動機，自難分別；而且踴躍參加競選，以民主的角度去觀察，終不失為一種好現象。不過參加競選的人，應有一種民主風度，不僅要經得起人民的批評，而且還要處處抱着退讓的態度，靠恨不要以為失敗是恥辱，成功是光榮。茍能如此，不特流弊不致層出不窮，就是選舉糾紛，也可因此减少。</p>
<p>要之，我們人民對於民主政治須要實地學習，政府對於首次普選，尤應愼重辦理，以免發生流弊，而能樹立民主的新作風，奠定我國憲政的始基。</p>

<h3>英訪華團招待記者</h3>
<p>（上接一版）繼由該團團員林賽答問稱：「對東北，華北之現局，因未至共區及戰地，無何了解，未便評論」。渠並避免提及其在平所作有關剿共之語。至於政府宣布民盟為非法團體一事，渠等對民盟認識不淸，民盟確係共黨之一部，則將不能成為一獨立民主政黨，政府之措施當有充分之理由。關於中國政府之行政效率問題，渠稱任何畳政府均應隨時提高其行政效率。最後，羅柏慈謂，渠等返國後當介紹中國情况於英人。英國之農具最適合於中小農耕作，然渠不知英國政府於何種情况下可與中國政府就此事談商協助之方法。渠鄭重聲述，英國外交政策決不干涉他國內政，亦不願有任何國家干涉他國的內政。渠認為去歲馬帥之調處中國政爭，乃得諸雙方之同意者，決非干涉內政。至於軍火援助一點，是否有干涉之嫌，則拒絕評論。羅柏慈並代表該團重申此行乃純友誼之訪問，旣無就某特別事項提出交涉之任務，亦不使批評其他國家之外交政策。在華多日，多蒙中國朝野盛情款待，至為感激云云。記者招待會結束後，一行六人齊至英大使館稍息，十一時半由施諦文大使及我體賓司王季徽帮陪赴政院一號官舍，拜訪張院長辭行，並留影為念。辭出後，即前任往外部拜會王外長，並應邀午宴。午後五至七時，該團復在國際聯歡社舉行鷄尾酒會，與我朝野名流話別，晚八時由印大使梅農設宴餞行。</p>

<h3>我國移民入暹交涉</h3>
<p>（上接一版）按暹羅於本年四月問擬宣布實施移民限額時，僅准我國每年移民一萬名，其他各國每二百名，我政府因暹方對我人民移往從未限制，且過去每年華僑入暹，常在數萬名以上，為觀及事實需要與維持兩民族之傳統關係。曾由我駐暹李大使迭與暹方交涉，嗣經暹國務院長同意，暫定我今年移民限額自五月起算至年底止為一萬人，明年以後之後民數額另議，詎實施後，暹移民局忽另作解釋，以我本年移民數額一萬名，除去一月份至四月份入暹人數後，五月至年底之實額僅為六六六七名，我政府對此項不符雙方協議之解釋，自難同意，且暹方事先並將滿額一事通知我方，突將其認為超額之華僑遣送回國，於理更為未合，故經我方提出嚴重交涉後，暹政府已同意將目前業經抵暹之華僑不再遣回，至一萬名限額，究應自何月算起一點，尙在繼續交涉。</p>

<h3>鐵簾背後·耕地處處　農業世家的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 波蘭行第八信　本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>華沙域中最大的機密，莫過於波俄之間的軍事合作，波蘭外交部國際宣傳處，供給我所有的資料，唯獨有關軍事的例外。甚至連目前波蘭有多少常備軍，也不肯輕易編造一個數字。倒是有一點，波蘭政府的大小官員，態度是整齊一致的。他們說：在波蘭領土內，沒有一個俄羅斯駐屯軍，因為波蘭是主權國家，戰爭打完了，他們都已經回去。</p>
<p>但是，成為歐洲謠言中心的輩沙，誰都在說，俄羅斯操縱着波蘭。當今華沙的內政和外交，都赤裸裸的與莫斯科有關，馬歇兩援歐計劃發表的時候，華沙　紙熱烈地捧過塲，但是等到莫落托夫拂袖而去離開巴黎的剎那。波蘭的左冀報紙，比莫斯科的態度更狂烈的　擊馬歇爾的理想，說馬歇爾想用「金圓」控制歐洲，作為白色帝國主義鯨呑歐陸的工具。這些話是不是「廣大人民」願意說的，那是另一個問題，我們看見的是：華沙官方一點一滴的小舉動，無一不是配合着莫斯科的態度的，有時候甚至「靑出於藍而勝於藍」，比俄國人高喊的，還要狂烈百倍。</p>
<p>現在改名為「勞工黨」的波蘭共產黨，人數約略估計，還不到一百萬人，無論就共產黨的歷史，力量，技巧各方面看，都不足於百分之百的控制住二千三百萬波蘭人民，因此，　　非常明顯，波蘭共產黨的背後，有所謂「外力」存在，這外力，便是俄羅斯駐屯軍。</p>
<p>一位波蘭外交部的職員，比較詳細地和我解釋過，他說：</p>
<p>正規的俄國駐屯軍，在波蘭是沒有的，許多外國遊客，坐火車一路看見的俄國軍人，以及外間稱我們為「鐵　背後」的國家，那純粹是地理和　通形勢造成的。</p>
<p>他說：「你先生從德國來，看見過俄羅斯在德國境內的龐大佔領區，這大　的俄國佔領區，接防，退　，都要經過波蘭，波蘭政府為了戰時的盟誼。以及俄國帮助波蘭復國的高情，當然不能不予以假道的方便，特別是波蘭境內有三條鐵道幹綫，完全是由俄國軍部新近條築起來的。」</p>
<p>他還說：「在戰爭以前，俄國的鐵道和德國的鐵道，都是一樣的「寬軌」波蘭的却多半是窄軌，為了减少換事，「車同軌」起見，波蘭政府充許俄國　築這中南北三條橫貫國境的大動脈，因此，管理權和　站權、都是屬於俄國軍部的，外間看到的許多紅星帽的俄國兵，原因在此。」</p>
<p>我不知道這些話是否全是事實，但無論如何，這樣的解釋是非常合理的。波蘭人跟東方人一樣「要面子」，九百多年來，一部波蘭的歷史，是歐洲國際舞台上的一幕大悲劇，亡國，依賴，逢迎，使多少波蘭人，在國際塲合中抬不起頭來，然而，我終究認為這不是波蘭民族性的罪惡，眞正造成波蘭悲劇的原因，還是他的農業的經濟生活。</p>
<p>希特勒在一九三九年以前，常常唱「工業德國，農業波蘭」的高調。波蘭供給德國原料，糧食，以及其他一切農產品，然後再向德國購買工業成品，甚至國防必備的武器。歐洲是近代文明，也就是工業文明的發源地，德意志在俾斯麥時代，完成了工業模型，俄羅斯在大彼得手裏，也建樹了工業的道路，甚至和波蘭隔一座喀爾巴阡山的捷克，也有了最新型的工業基礎，唯獨波蘭，始終還不脫「農業世家」的本色。第一次歐洲大戰以前，俄普奧三國瓜分波蘭，實際上是三個工業國控制了維斯杜拉河上的那個古老的農業世家。</p>
<p>我進入華沙的第一天，大使館的葆近甫（毅）代辦吿訴我：「波蘭是當今歐洲最大的農業國，在歐洲處處鬧糧荒的日子，波蘭的糧足的農產品，會使你驚諤。」十多天來，我住在布列斯特大旅館，每天有吃不盡的牛奶，麺包，鷄蛋和牛油，波蘭大小餐館，他們的烹調都像中國一樣，喜歡用「重油」，甚至許多油浮在菜面上。仲夏，犬　小毯，不少賣「冰淇淋」的店舖，他們呌作「洛黛」，香焦汁的，楊梅汁的，桃子汁的，什麼水派了一個　　調查團訪問歐洲，以決定美國對歐各個國別的農業援助，那位哈立　團長，一到華沙，大吃大喝，滿意之至，回到華盛頓，打了報吿給國務院：「波蘭全國有點富的農產品，無須美國農業援助。」（下接第五版）</p>

<h3>英市政選舉結果　工黨遭空前慘敗　保守黨已要求改選國會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播。由於工黨政府之　種缺點，選民中之不滿情緒顯有增加，比次市政選舉中之右傾趨向，共原因殆即在此。保守黨已由　兩登爵士向政府提出重選國會要求，但政府對於於此項要求，必予拒絕無疑？今日政府方面曾就遷舉初步結果發表聲明，申言此項結果雖令人失語，但不足以言政治趨向已起激烈變化。二年來工黨所獲之勝利至大且鉅，此次縱有百分之五市政議會席次由工黨轉入保守黨之手中，亦不足影響大局云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕工黨在英格　及　爾斯四百市鎮之內議會選舉中，已遭重大挫折。今晨宣布一日市選舉投票之結果，顯示：保守黨新增六三一席，損失一七席；工黨新增四二席，損失六八三席；自由黨新增四六席，損失三六席；共產黨新增無，損失九席；獨立派新增一七〇席，損失一三四席。現任保守黨主席前糧食部長伍爾登於選舉結果宣布後宣稱：市選舉結果之盟示右傾趨勢，僅有一個意養，余相信政府必須水認下議院已不復代表民主的政治思想，必須重新選舉。市選舉不僅表現人民對於地方事務之意見，亦表現對於國家事務之政見。選舉局勢之一面倒，表示英國人民已不復信任業已食言，並不能領導國家出於紊亂之政府。人民衆頗多相信政府茍能致力於復興國家之主要任務，則目前彼等所不得不應付之許多困難，均可避免；而國事茍能由更爲幹練之人處理，則許多雖　，亦當　需強迫人民接受。市這舉之結果，一方面表示人民之不復信任工黨政府，一方面亦表示全國之保守堂組織已告後活，且已表現其實力。按伍爾登氏係以保守黨主席身份，發表保守黨對於市選舉結果之正式反響。</p>
<p>工黨下議院中，　有較其餘各黨超過一百四十席之多數，昨日市選　之結果，顯示工黨所握之勢力，已爲保守當所奪。投票者人數，各區均在選民總數之百分之五十至八十之間，堪稱相當踴躍。工黨所受最　重之大忌，，乃爲在握有控　地方金融工商及市政專務的廣大　限之許多大城市中中，亦均失去權力。例如英國之最大工本中心　徹斯特，另一工業中心　明罕以及約克·蘭凱斯特，李廷諸區，均由保守黨自工黨手中奪得多數優勢。蘇格蘭之城市，其中最大者爲愛丁堡格拉斯哥，定於星期二舉行投票，倫敦市則須待諸明年始舉行。</p>
<h3>美共和黨全國委會主席　猛烈抨擊杜魯門　稱杜氏已向激進派屈膝</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕共和黨全國委員會主席李斯二日指斥杜黨門總統之召集特別國會，將高物價與援外兩事等量　觀。李氏稱：「杜魯門此舉，爲再度向激進派屈膝，企圖藉其支持以壯明年大選　勢。」</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦阿拉伯聯盟副主席赫賽尼（中排右第二人）出席聯大巴勒斯坦委員會，聲明堅決拒絕分治計劃。（聯合國駐滬辦事處贈）</p>
<p>李氏稱杜魯門曾向共和黨領袖保證，如特別國會必須召集，唯一之目的爲援助其他國家，然此事與激進之徒黨繼符，彼等要求恢復物價管制局及其他極繼組織，故杜魯門在召集別會議時對應付國家制止通貨膨脹之力量，如不大於緊急援歐法案，至少亦應與援歐等量齊觀。</p>
<h3>歐洲國家反對　設立監督機構</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓日電〕據悉：討論馬欵爾計劃之歐洲十六國經濟合作委員會當務委員會主席弗朗克斯爵士，最近訪美國代理國務卿洛維特時，曾將非正式備忘錄一紙，交與洛氏，表示希望正在起草馬歇爾援歐計劃之美國官員，勿對歐洲國家政府之使用向本國人民出售自夷所獲物資而得之本國貨幣，規定　於麻煩的限制。弗朗克斯指出任何方式之限制，必隨各國而不同，茍在各國國內設立管制前述資金之獨立機構，必致妨碍該本國政府對於其經濟之管制。又悉：衆議院議員赫特領導之衆院援外委員會，正在考慮由美國及每一受惠國設立五人委員會，以監督資金之使用。</p>
<h3>對日合約正式簽訂後　應准日本加入聯合國　我代表蔣廷黻率直表示</h3>
<p>〔中央社弗　淬草地一日合衆電〕合衆社記者頃向遠東委員會中之數代表提出詢問，請其說明對於日本之意見。中國代表贊成一俟對日和約簽字，即接受日本爲聯合國之正式會員國。菲律賓對此則極不同意。</p>
<p>中國代表蔣廷奉率直聲稱，一俟對日和約批准，即應允許日本加人聯合國。中國雖與日作戰長逾十載，然對日本並無永久憎惡之意，日本於履行其戰敗國所負全部義務後，即必須應允其立足於國際社會。菲代表羅慕洛與蔣氏意見完全不同，渠稱：唯有在對日和會結束後，日本始能居於「見習」地位，日本「見習」若干年後，始能考慮及其國際地位。其他各大國對此一問題，均拒不作答。蘇代表蕊羅米柯謂：「余對此問題，無可奉吿。」</p>
<h3>法市選舉最後結果</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二日電〕內政部頃宣布法國市選舉之最後結果，計中心派右翼派及載高業派政黨，共獲全國市議會席次之百分之四五。一；社會黨。獨立社會黨共獲百分之一八。七；急進黨　百分之二〇·五；人民共和黨獲百分之八。八；共黨及近共黨共獲百分之六·九。</p>

<h3>土耳其外交政策　推行睦鄰共同維護和平　對蘇聯無理要求表不滿</h3>
<p>〔路透社安加拉一日電〕土耳其總統伊諾努今日向國民大會本屆會議之百次會致辭，指蘇聯對土施行無禮指資，渠云，土國對蘇關係並不滿意，土國力圖與蘇建立良好關係，竟遭蘇方無理指摘。蘇聯以不正確及不公允之狀態，檢討過去及目前之事件，甚至對土國提出不公允之要求。</p>
<p>伊氏於聲明土國外交政第之唯一目標，在實現世界和平，儘量協助各國所切盼之共同安全之建立後，復個別述及土耳其與其他各國之關係，謂土國對英關係至爲良好，土國深切了解英國目前之困難，深信其必能在不久獲得目前奮鬥中之勝利。述及美國時，伊氏謂此一偉大民主國，決定給予土國以援助，足證其在和平方面不斷的努力。土國對法國之關係，條以悠久的傳統友誼爲根據，今尙在繼續積極發展中。土國並願加強與義大利之聯繫，對於新義大利之業已逐漸恢復國際地位，深覺欣慰。伊諾努於述及內政問題時謂，在土國之新預算案中，國防費佔最大部份，而鑒於某種事態，國防費恐猶不能應付一切需要。伊氏並力言土國目前主要之關切爲維護其安全。</p>

<h3>下屆聯大會　決定在西歐舉行</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖一日電〕權威方面今日宣稱：聯合國大會一九四八年會議，大約將在巴黎。日內瓦或比利時京城白魯塞爾舉行。聯合國機構之活動，將暫時由美國移往歐洲二三個月，實際上已經確定，僅地點尙待選擇。</p>
<h3>聯大會昨通過　西南非決議案　印度努力卒吿勝利</h3>
<p>〔合衆肚弗魯辛二日電〕聯大經整日辯論後，以四十一對十票，四國棄權同故宮　責南非聯邦之未能將西南非代管地置於聯合國之托管下。去年聯大建議南非將西南非交父聯合國托管，南非抗不遵守，此次聯大表決時，殖民國家被回敎，斯拉夫及亞洲大多數國家擊敗，印度反對南非多時，至此乃吿勝利。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦分治方案　美蘇間意見歧異　英國單獨負責治安恐難接受</h3>
<p>〔路透社敦二日電〕倫敦外交觀察家相信，英國將拒絕美國建議由英軍單獨負責一九四八年七月以前巴勒斯坦治安之辦法。惟外交部發言人則拒絕說明此一決議是否已通知美國。</p>
<p>外交觀察家復指稱，美國之此一新建議，已使美蘇間原屬一致之意見趨於不同。美國前此主張在國際軍之協助下，以執行分洽計劃，今則主張在分治實現以前，由英國單獨負責治安。阿拉伯國前曾指出蘇聯之贊同國際學建議，係爲因此可使蘇聯聯軍隊進抵地中海岸，然則蘇聯對於由英軍單獨留駐巴勒斯坦負責過渡期內治安之建議，預料當不能予以同意。就英國方面言，在整個聯合國大會得說分治計劃及其執行之方法表示其意見以前，尙不願肯定表明其態度。再就英國對於美新建議案之本質論，使十萬英軍在今後八個月內繼續在聖地担任無意味之任務，以執行據云並不爲貝文外相所信任之分洽計劃，當非英國所樂於接受。</p>
<h3>聯合國大會否決　託管非自治領土</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約一日電〕各殖民國家今日於聯大中　勝，因大會於延長辯論後，終於否決託委會之建議，此項建議要求所有管理非自治領土之會員國政府，將此種領土置於聯合國託管制度之下，中印回敎及斯拉夫國家均支持此項建議，認爲係促使殖民地人民趨向自治之最佳途徑。然殖民國家如美英比法則積極反對，最後表決爲廿四票對對廿四票，一票棄權，未能達到大會通過建議所需之三分之二多數數票。</p>

<p>印度國防部公報則稱，印度空軍戰鬥機隊已加緊巡邏活動及攻勢偵察。但陣地並無　動。兩日前自巴基斯坦西北邊省侵入之非正規軍約二千至之千五百之衆，攻擊史城西面守軍陣地未遂。同時，甘地昨夜祈禱時曾勸喀什米爾人民奮勇，勿因畏懼而出亡，應準備捐軀保衛家國。按喀什米爾邦居民以回敎徒爲多，藩王則爲印度敎徒，一周前併入印度自治領，以防瀋王政府被推翻。</p>

<h3>三輪車夫抗議加租　攔車滋事百餘被捕　小東門褚家橋一帶車輛幾瀕絕跡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨八時許，南市民國路小東門一帶起至西藏南路褚家橋止，突發生三輪車夫滋事糾紛。當時一般停駛之車夫三五成羣，沿途攔阻營業三輪車之行駛，甚至强力將乘客自車上拉下，並將車胎內之氣放出，迫令將車交還車主，冀造成罷工狀態。查此項糾紛之發生，係因最近車商對三輪車車租要求提高，計雙座車每日自五萬元增至七萬元，中型車自五萬元增眾五萬八千元，單座車自四萬元增至五萬元，同時並須追加保證金計雙座二百萬元，單座一百八十萬元。此次加價，車夫方面認爲剝削太甚，無力負担，一致反對，乃有一部份車夫散佈民國路至西藏南路一帶，暼見同業經過，即迫令停駛，致發生嚴朮糾紛。該處週圍所有三輪車瀕於絕跡。該管嵩山，邑廟，蓬萊各警分局飭大批警察四出兜捕，同時總局方面亦出動摩托車隊駛往滋事地點協助緝捕，該項糾紛始未擴大。事後據悉，由昨日上午八時起至晚九時止，各分局先後拘獲滋事三輪車夫，計蓬萊二十餘名，邑　二十名，嵩山四十餘人，常熟十餘人，長寗十餘人，徐家匯九人，盧家灣六名，共計百餘名。經帶局偵訊，以妨礙安寗違警罪，各拘役一天三天不等，以示　懲。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據社會局勞工處長沈鼎告記者，昨日上午南市一帶有一部份人力車夫罷工，並沿途攔阻他人上工。社會局據報，其罷工主因係因人力車夫互助會向在每一輛車租上附收該會福利事業費二百五十元，（單座三輪車由人力車改裝，亦照收）。由車商代收後每月解繳巿銀行，由互助會再向市銀行支取動用。最近因改變辦法爲每半年解繳一次，車商於七，八，九，十，四個月附收所得之福利事業費未曾解繳市銀行，人力車夫互助會因之無款可用。一部份車夫對此表示不滿，乃發生罷工行爲。社會局據報後，即派第七科長黃昌漢與工會方面分別前往勸導復工，吿以社會局已飭令人力車商業同業公會轉知各車商，將現存已收之四個月互助會福利事業費解繳市銀行。</p>
<p>沈處長繼復稱：人力車租糾紛迄未解決。車商要求按生活指數計算，但車夫因收入有限，生活淸苦，要求折扣。社會局爲此曾向市府建議人力車租應由各機關會同組織一審核委員會決定，市府至今尙無批示。</p>

<h3>刻苦自勵·篤守本位　六百餘留滬日僑　對上海是個諷刺　許多工廠醫院依賴他們策劃</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕離亂八載，勝利兩年，日本侵略主義的暗影，依舊是深刻而凄厲地遺留在每一個人的心頭。到現在，「帝國的英雄們」固然是隨着時代幻滅了，但是在我們的眼前，仍然存在着一種嚴正的諷刺：上海還有六百六十個留用的日僑！許多「飽經憂患」的工廠，醫院……的技術部門，還要依賴着這一千多雙手在計劃，在操作！</p>
<p>這六百多名日僑大概並沒有參預過戰爭，因爲據他們自己說：幾年前身列過「聖戰」戎行的人，早就心不自安，搶着回國去了。他們是技術人員，吃飯第一，中國政府旣然要留用，當然樂意效勞。並且聽說有很多是連行李都已摒擋登輪，等候撤送，結果爲我們發覺到是技術人材，終於被堅留下來。我們的寬大和溫情，的確使他們深深地感動了，他們就把感激表現在工作上面：篤守本位，勤勉將事，恪遵命令，不辭勞瘁。兩年來據說他們也得到了一點實際認識：在中國做事祇要用出他們原有能力和智慧的十分之六就够了，因爲我們的工業水準低，設備簡陋，要求的進度並不太高。</p>
<h3>對中國工業的見解</h3>
<p>和我們並肩工作的實際生活體驗，使他們對中國工業發生了很多令人驚佩的疑問。一個畢業於同文書院，名叫中山的日僑對記者說：中國到目前爲止，似乎還沒有脫離以廣大農村爲基礎的生產形態。如果要復興農村，一定先要大量輸出，用出超來換取自己生存發展的條件。他懷疑我們爲什麼不先致全力於農產品的大量生產與加工，向　饉的國家輸出。談到工業，他舉例說：瑞士的先天條件決定它祇能生產「精密機械」，所以瑞士鐘錶工業在他們國家的「重點生產」下占有了世界市塲。像中國現在的工業情形，還不能自製汽車，主要的是因爲不能製造車身零件。但是中國有煤有鐵，可以鍊鋼，爲什麼工業家不利用這些條件，光投資於零件的硏究與製造，將來用以爭取外匯，進而向世界工業巿塲宣戰呢？他說他留華已經十七年以上，最近更參加了中國工廠實際工作，從歷年細微的觀察中，發覺到中國是有很多工業，具備足够發展爲世界工業重要部份的條件的，但是結果似乎都在工業家的短見中被扼殺了。他對中國工業家有一個結論說：「爲自身利潤而生產的工業，不一定就是國家最需要的工業，他們到現在恐怕還沒有認淸！」</p>
<h3>有計劃地實行互助</h3>
<p>日本民族的深沉執着的性格，是我們所熟知的，在他們的「互助會」裏更充分的顯露出來。無論做事，對人，生活，以至活動，有秩序，更有計劃。六百多個日僑的每月收入，雖然因留用機關的職位差別而有高低，但是大家的生活水準卻意外的整齊，食粗糲，衣舊服，絕對沒有一個人例外。在僅有的月薪中，大家相互帮助，並且向「互助會」自動捐獻，辦「殘留子弟補習學校」，自己輪流擔任義務敎員。設「郵件箱」，自己輪流來往取送郵件。辦「救濟戰犯袋」，將衣服和食品援助同胞。至於　所的淸潔，紀律的約束，更做到了自信共信的程度。</p>
<p>六百多日僑現在祗有一千人左右的家屬，大部份的家　聽說還在日本國內，因此他們對郵件包裹的寄遞限制感到非常不便，因此他們又希望和約能够早日簽訂。據他們說：和約締結以後，根本無須設領，由中國警局管理最爲妥當。因爲他們祇要家庭團聚，留用機關不予解雇，他們將米還有不少人想請求入籍呢！說這句話的一個日僑曾經扮了一臉近乎諂媚的苦笑</p>
<h3>三百人有中國妻子</h3>
<p>留用日僑當中有三百人是娶中國妻子的。這些離亂夫妻所生的小孩，現在都在殘留子弟補習學校裏讀着書，據說他們的成績較之日本國內學生還要高。這些學生將來唯一的志願，是進入中國的大學繼續讀書。當記者參觀這所學校的時候，裏面一只陳舊的鋼琴彈着日本歌，外面兩個帶有中國血型的孩子綳着一副無吿的神情在出神傾聽，情調是憂　而又悽惻。這些天眞的「日本第二代」，但願他們永遠不再走上上代的覆轍。</p>
<p>面對着這一羣刻苦自勵的日僑，我們感到諷刺，雖然他們還沉浸在失敗的創痛中，並且還由別人在支配着他們自己的命運！</p>

<p>努力捐輸·奠定大局</p>
<p>次由社會部次長黃伯度代表谷部長致詞稱：戡亂拯難乃政府天職，然國家興亡，匹夫有責，人民亦應各本自救救人之宗旨，協力完成拯救工作，以求安走社會。江蘇監察使餒莊致詞，謂：華北爲兵力之源，貧窮爲紛亂之泉，戡平華北匪患，則華夏安定，拯救魯省難胞，則紛亂自息。市府秘書長沈宗濂致詞稱：上海市民安居樂業，實為無上幸福，但不能以己身安全而置同胞於不顧，山東地當要津，對於中原影響至巨，希上海市民努力捐輸，奠定大局。嗣由國民黨市黨部代表徐鴻亞，警備司令部副司令楊步飛等相繼發表意見後宣吿禮成，會後並有餘興多項，至五時半始散。</p>

<h3>蘇北行　通榆道上</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江一日訊〕由蘇北南通直　　楡縣境，長約一千華里的這一條通楡公路，無論就軍事觀點，或經濟觀點說，其重要性實無　於今日之津浦錢與膠濟綫。現在由南通經如　及　縣之海安以達東台縣城的這一段公路，長約二百四十華里，可謂暢通，逐　有裝運棉花·猪隻·鷄·鴨·鷄、蛋的商車開行，運輸以貨運爲主，客運爲輔，由通至東，票價每人九萬三千元，沒有座位，只好在高達丈許的棉花包上，或者在鷄猪之間的隙地，蹲伏一下，運氣好，可以在司機牙傍，以五萬大元的附加，換得一個位置，舒舒服服，來欣賞那沿綫的風光。</p>
<p>自衛隊·刮刮叫？見了匪·拔腿跑！</p>
<p>先說自衛隊，記者於十月二十五日，由鎭江渡江，經六圩揚州先至泰縣，當天在揚泰公路萬福橋，首次看見江都自衛隊員在鄉下的精彩演出，看到持槍攔車的緊張畫面，但那幾位江都縣自衛隊的分隊長，倒還相當守法重紀，終於接受記者的勸吿，制止了民衆自衛隊員的胡鬧，使全車可憐的民衆，衆口同聲喊了一個「好」，同時在東台鄉下，自衛隊的自衛精神，最近也來了兩場精彩的演出，時間是十月二十日的午夜，地點是距離柬台東門十八華里的梁垜。</p>
<p>據說，在十月二十日的前三天，梁　谷鄉的守望隊，曾經聯合了幾十根槍，至梁東鄉巢匪，因爲自衛隊未能及時增援，吃了一個大蛞，被匪打死了兩個鄕長，十多個靑年守望隊員，因此暴露了梁垜自衛隊及守望隊的低能和自私，於是，梁東鄉的殘匪，就於二十日夜間，向梁　本鎭來了一個突擊，兵不厭詐，匪軍更不厭詐，當時不渦來了兩三百匪，（包括赤手空拳的老百姓）。而從四面八方吹來的衝鋒號聲，好像就有七八支，大槪民衆自衛隊爲了避免無謂犧牲，以便將來達到眞正的「自衛」任務起見，就大夥兒，悄悄的拔腿跑，到足稱安全的掩蔽地區去了。這樣匪衆遂如進入無人之境，打開街上舖門，搶走廿餘挑的布匹和其他物資，並綁去若干民衆，臨行還破壞了通楡路上一座木橋，直到十月二十九那天，才搶修竣工，恢復通軍，事後民衆痛定思痛，對於一槍不發的民衆自衛隊，不無煩言，軍方及政府與縣城裏面的地方人士，對於這樣糟糕的自衛隊，雖然各有看法，各有說法，但事實如此，也只好同聲一歎。聽說東台自衛隊的帶隊官，大多是上面派下去，這班人艱難伺候，加之人·槍·經費，都須取諸民間，人事旣難協調，指揮管理亦多困難，倘不趕快改善，那遵守綏靖典則的縣長，又將代人受過了。</p>
<h3>希望寄在軍事上期待淸太平日子</h3>
<p>當梁垜匪警，繼泰東航綫十八里河口殘匪刦輪殺人之事件發生後，水陸兩路的安全問題，又在東台商民沉重的心頭加深一層陰影。這時，每個人的希望都寄託在軍事上。十月廿九日，周家垜收復消息傳出，人心才稍見安定，現在東台的淸剿工作，正在積極展開，全城商民，每天忍受那將近二千萬元的供應費，（代軍隊購辦草料，猪肉等之差價）來期待一個太平日子，因爲諸種事物都須做到一個軍事第一，這凄凉的孤城是顯得緊張而熱烈，最敏感的就是物價，江北泰東興三縣的物價，因爲生產少，消耗多，運費貴，雜費重，早就趕上江南了。東台的米價，盤旋於六十萬左右，猪肉每斤二萬元，燒草每百斤七萬元，粗絨棉花價錢也亂得很，籽花每百斤約在一百廿萬元外，而農民最怕的就是那嚇人的帽子和竹槓，記者在由東台到南通的這一天內，沿途所見，在公路上有收，驗，査，各種可以向人勒索錢財差使的，幾乎每個人都有一雙骯體的手，和一付猙獰的面孔，最可憐的是幾個警察，他們居然大模大樣的向車商和貨主們，收取一萬塊錢的小菜錢，而且要擠眉弄眼打渦門。</p>
<h3>于子三自殺　係由防範疏忽所致　看守者三人　決依法懲處</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州二日電〕浙江保安司令部昨頒佈嚴　不規行動布吿稱：倘有不顧國家民族整個利益，決依法定程序處理，惟當局爲愛護靑年及尊重學校常局意見，於偵査未及完畢時，即移送法院辦理。至于子三自殺，係由防　疏忽所致，　局已將看守王　蔣　華等三人禁閉看管，並將依法微處。又稱：受人蠱　而以罷工，怠工，或罷市要挾者，一律以妨碍　產　　社　　安　論。凡　　資問題，應以合法手續解決，不得　罷工怠工或罷市等不　舉動，否則即予堍辦不貸。</p>
<h3>這簍鷄兒那個的　快快快拿過錢來</h3>
<p>在通楡公路最吃香，最實惠，最舒服，而又量聰明的拿錢人，無過於收稅的先生們，他們大多坐在屋子裏不　面，由幾個穿制服的巡丁們，揚着紅旗攔軍子，只要車商貨主們懂得做人的道理，他們也就懶得到外面來查驗。記者乘的這一輛汽車，有猪，有　，也有棉花，但因棉花少，目標小，比蛟少麻煩。如果是一軍棉花，那就够你受。可是，鷄雖小物，也已有小頑意出現。當這一輛商軍，停放在東泰邊境一個小小的稅卡子門前時，意想不到的有人來查鷄了，一位操着南腔北調口音的巡丁，很威武似的走上車來，要數鷄，邊數邊喊：「這簍鷄兒那個的，快快，快快，」下面那句「拿錢來」的話，並沒有喊出口來，已經有人將一捲法幣，塞進了他那二尺五寸長的衣袋裘面，於是乎開車。（特派員房滄浪）</p>

<h3>農業世家的悲哀</h3>
<p>（上接第二版）記者在前一封通訊裏，提到過這件公案，後來，引動了國際宣傳處外籍記者招待會上許多有趣的爭辯。如果我是那時候的哈立遜團長，我一定有和他完全相同的感想。我知道：這件事情發生以後，華沙市政府，頒布了一條新命令，每逢星期一，二，一家大餐館的侍者吿訴我：「那是狗屁，我們波蘭別的沒什麼驕傲，就是不愁『　的』，波蘭有的是豬肉，牛肉，羊肉，爲什麼禁止客人們喫肉？」</p>
<p>這些情形，說起來也相當可愛，華沙的，以及從別的小城　建來看我的華僑朋友，紛紛餽贈了我不少鹹肉，臘腸，火腿，以及大塊大塊的猪油，他們說：「德國樣樣有，就是缺乏喫的，波蘭別的沒有，就是多食物。」我感謝他們的厚意，尤其欣賞他們那套簡單明瞭的經濟常識。</p>
<p>波蘭共產黨的經濟建設是値得稱道的。他們隨時在發動所謂「冬耕運動』和「春耕運動』。新到波蘭大使館任職的邊秘書，他坐火軍來華沙，一路上，他沒有看見一畝荒地，這和法國的『遍地皆荒蕪」，正是一個有趣的對比。他說：波蘭的農民極淳樸，一路來，看見許多波蘭的農民，住茅草房屋，夏天飛舞著蒼蠅，這些農業社會特具的本色，在德國和法國的領土以內，是絕對找不到的。</p>
<p>光復以後，波蘭的貨幣經過一度小小整理，貨幣的單位，仍然稱之爲：『紙洛堆』，一塊美金，官價合一百枚「紙洛堆」，但是，因爲外匯平衡，美金黑市賣到八百或九百，據說：在二三個月以前，賣到一千多，在鐵簾背後的紅色世界裏，華沙的商業自由，令我驚奇，大馬路的百貨商店櫥窗裏，什麼都有，價目都高得千位數，萬位數，有錢的人可以任憑享受，大部份的波蘭人，或者薪水階級，都祗能望着櫥窗興嘆！</p>
<p>華沙沒有像柏林那樣「憑證分配」的制度，因爲房荒，住的問題是警察局管制的。戰前二百萬人口的華沙，現在只賸了三十萬人，仍然不够居住，（因爲都破壞了）。警察局規定兩個人合用一間屋，小家庭如果要找有洗間，有廚房的理想「套房」，跟上海一樣，就得化一筆『頂費』，在歐洲叫作「鑰匙費」，很多華沙的房客，頂費都以美金票計算。</p>
<p>在政府公務人員這一個小圈子之內，彼　也有他們的配給制度。在華沙，公務員有住宅，有鞋，衣料，以及食物的配給。我問過一位市政府職員，他說：「我們祗領很少的薪水，但生活沒有問題！」</p>
<p>共產黨管理國營工廠以後，工人的生活，和公務員完全一樣。波蘭當局，現在正努力在推進工業化運動，特別是取得了德國東部的領土以後，「西里西亞年產白煤三百一十萬噸，泥煤一百七十萬噸，平空使波蘭成爲全歐洲第四個產煤國家。上次莫斯科會議的時候，三强討論到德國的賠償和復興問題，馬歇爾國務卿說：德國失去了西里西亞的煤源，如何能期望德國生產？因之，馬歇爾認為：波蘭應該吐出半個「收復區」，駭得彼蘭全國朝野都震動。波蘭外交部漏夜趕編了許多　史地理的證明，從理論上，從歷史淵源，地理背景，乃至於土地人口分配，證明應該是波蘭的領土。一方面，在事實上　造成旣成局面，加緊趕走　　人，移居波蘭人，以避免將來對德和約上的「翻案」。</p>
<p>華沙的國際宣傳處，送了我很多小册子，並且歡迎外國記者參觀他們的「收復區」的新政。如今收復區的總督，是共產黨書記長戈墨卡，波蘭的小史達林先生。</p>
<p>「收復區」還包括著大半個東普魯士，原先波蘭的最大隱痛，是缺乏海岸錢，僅有的一個海口「但澤港」，還隨時成為希勒陰謀的藉口，如今，但澤全部歸入了波蘭的版圖，原先一百四十公里的海岸綫，現在增加到五百五十公里。波蘭政府特地規定了一天，叫做</p>
<p>「海岸節」。今年的海岸節，皮魯特大總統，赴海邊檢閱彼蘭的海軍。</p>
<p>農業世家的工商業建設是不容易的，海岸綫有了，船是更必需的，波蘭有一家國營輪船公司，去年向美國買了三條商船，現在正航行於「波羅的海」和大西洋上。。寄自布列斯特飯店）</p>

<h3>受香港黑市滙兌　廣幫搶購桐油走私　桐油輸出業領袖談出口現況　本年度滬港輸出共約五萬噸</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據桐油輸出業領袖談稱：本年度桐汕由上海香港兩地輸出者截至目前止，共約五萬噸。其中美國約佔百分之六十，英佔百分之十五，歐陸各地及蘇聯日本約佔百分之二十五。關於海外價格，　美國方面，其市價每磅約爲二角五分美元，該國自產之貨，規定爲每磅二角七分，其差額則由政府補貼，故市價相當穩定。近因香港商人一時賣空，未能於十十一月交付期貨，爲數約一二千噸，紛紛在滬補進應成，致行市略動。　英國方面現價爲每英噸二〇五英鎊，按此，由港輸出之貨，尙可獲利。但英政府解除桐油限制後，尙有四千噸在手。該國供應處並規定，商人如向國外購買桐油，同時必須向其政府購買同量之上項存油，其價格則如上述。換言之，商人經營桐油，乃係向我國及其政府所購桐油之平均價格爲標準。　歐陸其他各地，因缺乏美元，故對進口管制，亦如我國之嚴格。</p>
<p>我國美金與英鎊之比例，爲三與一，而歐陸人民心理，則韶爲四與一之比，較爲合理。如此彼等旣乏美元，復不願以目前比値，向我國購貨，加之進口證不易獲致，故交易淸淡。該方人士對我國桐油輸出之看法，則稱：我國桐油自八月十六日外匯新辦法公佈後，桐油貿易，賴以開展；尤以平衡會初期對於美匯匯率之合理調整，更能促進桐油輸出；惟近月來，匯率保持平衡，致滬市桐油價裕，高出國外約達百分之二十，因此輸出量减少。國內價格，以長沙爲最高，每祖一四八萬元，如遝上海，外加運費，其總値高出上海者約百分之十。考其原因，爲香港黑市匯兌，較國內牌價高達百分之八五，因此造成廣帮走私。商人在該地高價搶購，華南緝私雖已加强執行，終以美匯黑市與牌價相去懸殊，走私之風仍熾，此爲當前正常商人之威脅。同時根據過去經驗，港方銷路增加，即能影響美國市塲。我國當局亟宜注意及之。上週輸出推廣外，曾召集桐油商談話，對此問題，提出討輪。雖有少數商人爲求打開此種困難，企圖目前利益，意欲政府恢復收購政策，預料政府方面，恐難辦到。蓋大多數商人之意見，及國外之輿論，對於我國收購政策，未表贊同，尤以美國方面極力主張自由民營，以發展國際貿易。該方人士又稱，目前我國新油將於一二月內陸續登塲，過去產量總額，雖無精確調査，但本年度依據谷地報吿，除鄂東收成略差外，其他各地均佳，可共獲七萬噸之譜。除供應內銷外。外銷部份，可達六萬噸。至如何維持此外銷數字，則首先注意生產成本，及合法利潤，此則端賴政府加以保護，或仿照美國辦法，保證一定價格，低洛時，予以補貼，再如規定每祖桐油等於白米若干斗，其價格隨米價而進退，以鼓勵農民之生產云。</p>

<h3>要制止惡性膨脹必須實行「備現」政策</h3>
<p>— 林霖</p>
<p>（編者按）本文作者，留學美國多年，專攻銀行貨幣學，着述豐富，其專門論著，散見於美國著名刊物，如美國經濟學評論，商業與財政週報及自由世界等。</p>
<p>我國當前，有一個大敵，現正加緊向我們進攻。他的來勢，一步進一步，無孔不入，不論人們在城市，或在鄉村，家居或外出，都不免要受他的侵害；而且他的侵略，日增月累，愈久愈烈，如果不及時制止他，這個大敵恐怕要毀滅我們的國家於無形！這是一個什麼敵人？就是發行膨脹，物價膨脹和歲精膨脹，三種膨脹惡性循環所形成的逃走膨脹〔Runaway　Inflationg），這個逃走膨脹的形式，有如下述：　因為物價價高漲，所以國家歲虧增大，　因爲國家歲　增加，所以鈔票發行增加；　因爲鈔票發行增加，所以物價益形高漲；　因爲物價益形高漲，所以國家歲虧加倍增大；　因爲國家歲虧加倍增大；所以鈔票發行加倍增加；　因爲鈔票發行加倍增加，所以物價更加回上高漲。</p>
<p>我們知道，政府雖然多次採行過各稱統制物價辦法，但從未達到預期效果，政府雖然疊申平衡歲出歲入決心，但歲虧依然有增無减，至於統制鈔票發行，一向未有一個有效的方案。結果，自一九四〇年到現在，逃走膨脹，不但未見和緩，反而加急，老實說，已經到了一個不可收拾的危險地步，所以有許多悲觀的中外觀察家，都以爲我國財政瀕於破產，經濟行將崩潰了。</p>
<p>但據作者淺見，認爲此刻馬上設法挽救，還不算太遲；只要我們有決心，能鼓起大無畏的革命精神，立刻可以制止這個逃走膨脹大敵的攻勢，挽救危機。首先我們要明瞭什麼是「逃走膨脹」的主要原因：大家都知道，今日中國有下列各種不良現象。　貨物供給短少；　交通工具缺乏；　生產費用增加；　奸商操縱投機；　市面需要增加；　通貨流通增加。</p>
<p>不錯，上述六種現象，單獨地或聯合起來，都有使物價上漲或助物價上漲的可能，但他們均不是「逃定膨脹」的主因。只可算是次因，因爲現時物價是在那裏繼續急激地飛漲，而且是循着幾何級數加速飛漲，並不是照數學級數遂步上升。</p>
<p>拿通貨流通增加一項來說吧，據某作者的估計，我們中國今日通貨發行數量比戰前只增加五千倍，但物價卻泓了三萬五千倍，姑不論通貨數量學說對不對，最少我們可以說，現在物價膨脹與通貨數量增加的關係，已成脫節了。</p>
<p>「桃走膨脹」的主要原因是什麼？老實說，是人民對法幣失去了信仰。</p>
<p>國法幣制度，原是最合現代化的制度，自一九三五年實行以來，成績卓然；尤其對於抗戰財政，有過很大的貢獻，抗戰最初三年，全國物價水準，異常平穩，並無惡性膨脹現象，軍費雖然浩大，但歲虧並不過度增大，這是法幣的功績，不可抹殺的。</p>
<p>不幸到了一九四〇年，霹靂一聲，中國當時唯一的國際交通生命錢，即滇緬公路，突然截斷了，這樣一來，全國震驚，物價飛漲，無形中給中國法幣一個致命傷。自滇緬公路關閉了的三個月起，法幣價値，直往下跌，遂形成今日一蹶不振，繼續下降的趨勢，這可說是「逃走膨脹」的起點，也就是國民對法幣失去信任的開端。</p>
<p>此後，一方面因全國物價飛漲，戰費突然大增，歲出遂不斷加多；一方面因淪陷區逐漸擴大，稅收行政效率减少，歲入也就日見减少；於是入不敷出，歲點日形龐大。政府因要實行抗戰到底的決策，要爭取最後勝利，只得忍痛地刮肉療瘡，增加發行，以爲應付。上述三種惡性循環的膨脹，於是形成。</p>
<p>政府和人民原來都希望抗日勝利戰爭結束後，歲虧可以减少，發行可以縮小，物價可以下降，膨脹趨勢，不致擴大，那曉得，日本投降手續還沒有辦妥，共匪便乘機打刦，發動搗毀戰。中央當局痛念國人渴望和平，民生念需養息，不得不委曲求全，讓步言和，共匪方面，得寸進尺，利用停戰時間，積極擴充地盤，由陝北到蘇北，由華北到東北，大有席捲而來，於是內戰擴大，惡性循環，也就延續下去。他的禍害，日益猛烈。國民對法幣信任，只有减少，更無增加。此外，再加上黃金拋售的失策，變本加厲。致令法幣貶値，一瀉千里，迄今未已，貽害無窮</p>
<p>人民對法幣一旦失去信任，那麼，任何統制物價辦法，也會失去效力，何況我們中國地廣人雜，又缺乏現代統制條件呢，所以物價依然繼續波動，大家還是天天看漲！</p>
<p>人民對法幣一旦失去信任，那麼，任何外匯定率，也無法維持。自從去年三月迄今，不及二年，美匯匯率，已提高四次了：去年三月把美匯率自五百元提高至二千零二十元之後，不到半年，便維持不住，只得於八月中又提高至三千三百五十元，可是不到半年，便又維持不住了，今年二月中來一個緊急處置辦法，把美匯提至一萬二千元。換句話說，六個月內，提高了三倍半。就是這樣，還是無法維持。到了今年八月中，只得再加調整，這次，一面維特原有官價一萬二千元，一首規定一種新匯率，叫做「基準匯率」，最初的定率是四萬元，無形中又把美匯提高了三倍三。</p>
<p>人民一旦對法幣失去信任，那麼，任何政府預算，也不能平衡。國家收支不平衡的原因很多，這裏我們不能過細討論。我們要特別指出來的，是在「戡亂」軍事期內，歲出要超過歲入，係不可免的現象，不過今日之不平衡，與昔日之不平衡，實在不可相提並論。昔日的不平衡，所差數量有限，至多不過等於百分之幾或幾十。今日的不平衡，動輒相差在百分之二百或三百以上。（不用說，今昔不同的最重耍原因，不是軍費的增加，而是物價的加速飛漲。）</p>
<p>不但這樣，一般平民，因爲對法幣已沒有信任，所以不敢也不願儲蓄。至於那些大富，不是做投機生意，便設法把資金向外逃避，當然談不到集資生產。還鵝，外資因裏足不前，即僑匯亦無法吸收，外貨充斥市塲如故，出口貿易則日形疲困，因此，國際收支不平衡的現象，也就日益深刻化，尖銳化！</p>
<p>要制止膨脹，必須先恢復人民對法幣的信仰，要恢復人民對法幣信仰，必須實行「備現」政策。現化通貨價值的維持，固然不靠「兌現」，但不能不「備現」。通貨是一種信用，在一般民衆限中，通貨信用的唯一的可靠担保，還歸根結底於『現金準備」。比方，美元，自一九三三年以後，是一種不兌現的通貨；但美元的價値比任何國家通貨都穩定；其中最大原因，一半是管制有方，一半是「備現」充足。大家都知道，美鈔後面有全世界最大量的黃金準備。假職我們有「現金」做法幣的後台，說還願意給法幣來拆台？</p>
<p>「備現」政策，簡單的說，是厲行收積現金現銀爲法幣固定準備的政策，換一句話說，政府此時要立刻下大決心，採行各種鵝效方法，收買並儲積大量金銀，並公開封存此項金銀，作爲法幣固定準備金，此項準備現金，不是流動資本，也不是外匯基金，是發行銀行固定資本的一部份，是法幣後面的保證金，除非發行銀行停業，絕對不準動用，同時要將每月收買及封存實數，公開檢査，公布全國。</p>
<p>收買儲積現金準備的具體辦法，約有下列幾種：</p>
<p>發行長期（三十五年至五十年）甲種「金準備公債」，以兩為單位，利息從優，以換取國內現存黃金，此種公債，當專向持有黃金金條之人民或法人推銷，並常責令從前購買政府黃金者，儘量多購。所得黃金，按月封存。　發生長期（二十五年至五十年）乙種「金準備公債」，以美元為單位，利息從優，以換取外匯。此種公債，當專向持有外幣證劵、或存款者及海外華僑推銷。所得外匯，不准他用，只能供購買國外現金現銀之用，所得金銀，按用封存　出售國內乘餘物資，所得代價，以換取國內外現金現銀，所得金銀，按月封存。　積極開採已知金鑛及銀鑛，此項業務所費多少可不計，但求增加金銀數量。所得金銀，按月封存。　舉借「備現」外債，所得債額，專供收買外國黃金，為法幣固定準備金之用，所得黃金，按月封存。「備現」政策，開始實行的時候，一定鵝許多心理上的或技術上的困難和阻碍。我們相信，這些困難可阻碍，是暫時的；只要我們能鼓起大無畏的革命精神，有什麼困難和阻碍不可以打破呢？</p>
<p>我們深信「備現」政策，是立信的政策，是恢復人民對法幣信任的唯一鵝效的辦法。</p>
<p>這樣，把惡性循環的膨脹拴住了，再也不會瘋狂似的逃走了。大敵已除，穩定幣值，減少歲虧，平定物價，都可以順利進行，達成效果，那麼，中國可以不致跳入財政破產經濟崩潰的深坑，不但戡亂軍事的勝利，可以早日來臨，即建國大計，也可以早日實現。</p>

<p>（一）口紅</p>
<p>白描的一幅觀音像，頂上一圈淡墨暈成的圓光，座下是一朵白蓮花，左邊角上仔細印上了一點口紅，鮮艷非常，那是作家的印信。</p>
<p>（二）新裝</p>
<p>玻璃杯是美酒的新裝。唐朝時候，紅艷艷的葡萄酒，就已穿上了夜光杯。現代的香檳，檸檬似的淡黃，便要穿一件富麗的長抱，圓椎形的高高的玻璃杯。　　（三）光亮</p>
<p>相愛的朋友到了，白粉的牆壁要求光亮，衣廚上的鏡子要求光亮，玻璃窗要求光亮，桌子椅子都要光亮，就是自已也要重新梳裝一下，修飾得光光亮亮：把所有的電燈都啓開了啊！</p>
<h3>秋之歌</h3>
<p>— 徐銘懷</p>
<p>黃昏</p>
<p>數陣輕風，一番凉雨，山國的黃昏早給渲染得秋意盎然了。</p>
<p>殘蟬曳長它暗啞的顫聲，訴說着金色年華消失的悲哀；夜茉莉護定它最後的綠蒂，瑟縮地，凄然地埀淚。紫荊花底夢境正酣，是灰黯的日子裏惟一紅色的點綴呵！瘦詩人會將眼淚擦在它最末的纎細的花瓣上，吿訴它秋雖然來，冬雖然來，而此後接着還是彩虹似的春天；吿訴它黃昏底脚步雖然走近，綺麗消息，在山後落日的那邊，正揚起黎明的輕塵，蟋蟀底低吟在晨議裏顫動。</p>
<p>黃昏淡靑色的睡衣落下時，蟬聲的餘波已在暮　裏消逝，蟋蟀又在牆脚跟嘈切的私語了，彷彿是埀暮老人寒傖的聲欬，遠方游子抑鬱的歎息，啜泣……</p>
<p>蝙蝠，黃昏的詩人披上黝黑的晚禮服在空際巡禮，匆忙地，是在找尋它失落的詩篇，梦幻？</p>
<p>落葉</p>
<p>綠葉己充滿一片濛漠的遲慕的心情，它將離去這煩囂的塵世，踏上另一陌生的旅程。</p>
<p>時間老人所賜予的善意的洗禮早成陳迹，熱情的慰籍跟綠色的綴飾也已枯竭。矚望前程，無休止的無盡頭的路呵，荆棘縱橫；走着平坦而溫暖的路過來的，又怎堪墮人顚箥的窮途？追懷往昔，誰又忍心見到今後的冷酷和淡漠？綠葉，它將褪下綠色的外衣，捨棄恩賜的一切，饑饉着，乾　廣，獻身給下一代。是鄧南遮筆下的英雄呵，慷慨地爲着愛犧牲一切。</p>
<p>悽楚地吻別，又悲壯地在風風雨雨中葬失。聽落葉唱起它蕭瑟的輓歌吧；尋尋覓覓，冷冷淸淸，悽悽慘慘慽慽。彷彿是潯陽江頭的咽泣，易水之濱太息，是失意的咽泣，蒼凉的太息。念波特來爾的詩篇呵：</p>
<p>「我戰慄靜聽每一片落葉，</p>
<p>落在厚積的堆上，回聲愈急。</p>
<p>我底頭腦好像一座將倒的城牆、</p>
<p>那沉重的撞褪還在不停地突擊。</p>
<p>這單調的哭擊，引起我的想像，</p>
<p>彷彿誰在理緊把棺材釘起，給誰呢？給過云的夏，目前的秋季，</p>
<p>還有神秘的聲響，像是在出喪。」（秋之歌）我心底泛起絲絲哀愁。再念保羅。魏爾崙的詩篇呵：「我願去在凄凉的風裏，</p>
<p>任它吧，將我磨折，</p>
<p>這裹——那裹</p>
<p>鵝如地面的死葉。」</p>
<p>我憬悟到這該是人心的寫照，人生的寫實。秋之美感張若嚴</p>
<p>一個薄暮的秋天，我默默的坐在一間幽靜的書齋裏，是時渡睡乍醒，簾外下着纎雨，雨點滴着粗枝高幹的梧桐葉上，一種凄淸幽遠的音調，令人悵然！「疏雨滴梧桐」，也不知激動了多少接婦曠夫的幽懷。</p>
<p>秋天使人聯想的是紅葉，疎林，雪蘆，紫蟹，……元人小令有句云「雁聲蘆葉老，鷺影　花寒」描繒秋江野景，它像一幅圖畫似的逗起了我對着秋的憧憬。</p>
<p>春以花豔，夏以葉鮮，但春夏是濃妝艷抹的，充溢着過量的凡塵的氣息。而秋是造物者運用了爈火純靑的技巧，所創造出來的傑作。它猶如蘇東坡的文章行雲流水一般，而不着痕跡。神韻也勝過春夏兩季，秋天的淸麗，恰似一輸皓月，它的灑脫有似深</p>
<p>深秋，我在一個鄕村散步，當夕陽斜映的時節，我傍着一個枯乾的湖沼徘徊着，曲徑上栽着幾行待髠的衰柳，湖沼中滿著凌亂的殘蘆，一會兒蘆蓋裏驀然問飛起了無數的銀雪色的白鷺，墨點似的灑滿天空，與湖面被西風吹着的蘆花，沈醉似的舞着，顯出一種悲壯滄凉的意境。雖只是俄頃的淹留，卻給人以深長的回味。</p>
<p>許多人以爲秋天是感傷的季節，古今中外的文人騷客，對它也分外的敏感，有人喩它是「死神的收穫期」，也許秋的成熟和豐滿惹了死神的妒忌，逼着它匆匆的走進墳墓。美國詩人郞菲羅，比喩秋是年邁者無依的老人，究其實他們都抹殺了秋的光輝的部份。因爲僅僅秋，天賜予我們的美感，已够令人陶醉了。</p>
<h3>秋天</h3>
<p>— 培茵</p>
<p>一個沁凉的黃昏</p>
<p>階前的蟋蟀第一次唱出秋天的歌　　昨夜，我聽到秋天經過林子　　撫摸過豐饒的田野　　越過西方的重山</p>
<p>來到我底菓園　　伙天長着兩個紅而長的翅膀</p>
<p>到處散播着秋底氣息</p>
<p>田野拋棄了半年來的綠色　　披一件淺黃的長衣　　西風微笑着季節的　饒</p>
<p>爲山林鍍上紅色的嬌絕……</p>
<p>爲着人類的機故</p>
<p>秋天帶來季節的與籠</p>
<p>稔熟的田野</p>
<p>豐收的菓國</p>
<p>在農村裏漾起一陣軒朗的笑　　秋天</p>
<p>我凝望流水漂送紅葉　　聽西風佻皮地歌唱</p>
<p>讓紅葉飄落在我底雙肩……</p>
<h3>淸秋散綴</h3>
<p>— 疾雨</p>
<p>秋山</p>
<p>晴朗的日子，登山涉水，在秋天裏賞心樂事。看楓葉紅如醉翁的臉，烏柏樹葉片片綴滿山頭，如少女的胭脂。而黃葉還未開始隨風飄落，綴一片紅葉在你底衣襟，如熱血洒在戰袍上似的美麗，歸途上自己彷彿年靑了許多</p>
<p>秋郊</p>
<p>江南的秋光，在平野間也是很美的，蒼鬱的樹色，遍地的黃花，踏着你底偷閒而來的脚步，盡情地流連在這塊未凋的芳草地吧。秋郊是畫意多於詩意的。茅舍，耕牛，村女，牧童，小橋，流水……無一不是最好的繪畫題材。携着盡其，隨意揀一個僻靜的地段，畫一張水彩或速寫，是你最好的收穫。</p>
<p>秋水</p>
<p>水是柔情的象徵，在淸秋的湖山之間，和幾個朋友共划一舟談笑間，讓小船出沒於殘荷斷梗以及幽暗橋洞，也是最快意的境界。假如這時你在玄武湖上，看斜陽掛着灰蒼蒼的城牆，湖波燦爛如錦，遠望鷄鳴寺古剎一角，紫金山兩峯樹籠在蒼茫的暮色裏，在懷古的情懷中可也鵝著淡淡的哀愁。</p>
<p>秋花</p>
<p>重陽前後的深秋使人心多感，即使沒有風雨也多少有些愁緒，可是當你進入秋花盛開的園林，眼前頓時發亮，心境也跟着開朗。看這滿園黃紫紛披的菊花，要不是四周有其他蕭索的景色陪襯着此身無疑路入春之懷抱了。</p>
<p>做霜的秋菊，並非祇給那些持螯而有詩興的人士去觀賞的，即使庸俗的販夫走卒也該有他們的眼福，倒是那些目前自命清高而過云數年間曾鵝過斑斑汚點的人，不知道他們對花有無愧色？</p>
<p>珍惜這刹那即逝的好景吧，只怕秋花凋謝盡時，江南整個明麗的秋光祇留得寂寞一片。</p>

<p>「照我的佔計，大概够了。」耀羣似乎很有把握似的；「鬼子特工的大本營裏，除了我們這裏的四個人以外，還有買沙夫。另外還有昨天晚上小老虎帶來的兩個好手，咱們關外的兩個小頭目：一個就是那位老龍，一位就是武說。旁的咱們不能幹，躲在黑地裏放他幾槍，給他引上幾把火，乘那　東西東奔西突的當口，再來一個密集射擊，大概也可以攪動他一下了。」</p>
<p>耀　把她的計劃說了這麼多，但是我所吸收的印象很淺。我沉吟了一會，想把耀羣所說的這許多話，在我腦筋中重新組織一下。在回想的當中，我感覺得還有許多問題，不大明白，所以不能不一點一點的提出來。剛要澦備發問，我腦筋中又浮現了一個可怖的影子；這是由於我離開我那個臨時的大本營，已經兩三小時了；害怕那裹有什麼不測的事發生。想到道裏，便趕緊對大儍子「〇四」，打了一個手勢：「請你快回去溜溜，看看有什麼消息沒有；快去快來！」說畢，瞧着「〇四」動身走了，這才把我所想問的幾個問題，對耀羣提了出來：</p>
<p>「紀小姐，假定我們今天晚上舉行夜襲，　以為我手下這幾個人，都應當參加嗎？」</p>
<p>羣聽了，略略沉思了一會：「這一點，我想需要您自己決定；因爲我還沒有知道您在這一帶是如何出塲的。」</p>
<p>「還不是我的老職務嗎——鶴見的私人秘書，兼行動支部主任——可是我現在心理很亂，眼下還不能決定我們這邊幾個人，是不是應該參加。」這是由於我想到參加的後果，才有這個疑慮。</p>
<p>「那麼說……」耀羣思索了一下；「我們不如來一個折中的辦法，您看怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「怎麼折中呢？」我有些不明白；所以怔怔地瞧着耀羣。</p>
<p>「我想在舉行夜襲之前，記虎弟先給你透一個消息；或是讓申先生（即〇四）晚上八點上這裏來一次也行，您得到夜襲的消息以後，您應着當時的情形，斟酌辦理，或是參加，或是同日本的特務混在一起，瞧瞧他們在夜襲的時候，有些什麼舉動。您看怎樣？」</p>
<p>我點了點頭：「這個辦法也不錯……可是您先前計劃夜襲的時候，還沒有知道日軍今晚十二點也要發動攻勢。現在旣是鼎元兄得到了這個情報，您對於舉行夜襲的計劃，有沒有什麼變動？譬如……」</p>
<p>羣立刻接口，很堅決似的說：「我準備提早一小時——即就是說，鬼子準備午夜十二點鐘開始進攻，我們就在十一點左右發動；爲的是要給他們一個措手不及。可是目前還不能十分確定，因爲我還要等候買沙夫昨晚的情報……」</p>
<p>「唔……我忽然想起了買沙大的問題。這傢伙在我的腦筋中，也扣上了一個疙瘩，早就想把她現在串演的角色，分析得淸楚一點：「我對於買沙夫的行動，還有些不大明瞭……」</p>
<h3>寫作一得</h3>

<p>A.陶樂普（AnlloryTrollope）放下筆桿，將近七十五年了，到現在，他還不失爲偉大著作家之一。但在他當時自己看來，自承為字彙工廠—意思是他先大量生產生字，然後零售出去。在他的自傳中，曾經述及他工作的機械方法，他說：</p>
<p>「當我開始一篇新著的時候，我總是備一册日記，把它分成幾星期，找於是決定在那些時間內要完成那些工作。</p>
<p>「我於是沉醉在工作裏，一天一天過去，我規定寫好多少頁。如果我有一時的怠惰，工作的記錄曾啟示我，警惕我，叫我不要　於工作。</p>
<p>「依照境地的不同，我預備一星期要寫多少頁。平均起來總有四十頁一星期，最低二十頁，鵝時會直昇到一一二頁。由於頁數是含渾的，我決定每頁至少二百五十字，又怕字愈寫愈糊塗，所以一面寫着算着。</p>

<p>他從事寫作生涯的首二十年，就寫下了二十四本書，有的寫到一本四五部的—那時他供職於英國郵局，整天沒有閑暇的時間。因此一有空，他便督促自己去寫作。他每週給僕人以額外的償金，叫僕人每天喊醒他，這樣他可以五點半便可開始工作。</p>

<h3>宇宙綫</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>原子能可以給最智慧的人類利用為結束第二次世界大戰的武器，難道宇宙射射射綫就不可以被人們利用作爲第三次大戰中的新武器嗎？</p>
<p>一般人的心理老是被愿十彈的威力震驚着視爲世界上就沒有比它更猛烈的了，而不知神秘的宇宙間還存在着這種能最比原子彈更强的宇宙射綫。</p>
<p>宇宙射綫早在二十年前已爲科學家所硏究與探討的重要問題、經過證實而確言，宇宙射綫爲一種其有極高能量的質點。它與光子和電子差不多存在於宇宙間的各部分，時刻向廣闊無際的星羣放射而進入地球的大氣層後，只能存在於離地一百英里的高空中，就是反射高頻無錢電波的游離層。因爲宇宙射綫的質點羣以可驚的高速飛射進大氣層時，即與空氣中的各原子核相碰擊，並將它擎裂而成游離，這也就是游離層的成因。而這些經過碰繫後的宇宙錢，就變成速度比本身更高的質點這些質點再繼續向前進行而到達地面上。</p>
<p>這一種與空氣原子梭相擊而成的高速質點，即稱爲介子（Meson），它的質量比電子大二百倍，但其壽命則極短促，大概在百萬分之一秒。又因到達地面上時的密度很小，所以人們雖然經每秒鐘幾百個介于所撞擊或穿透，並不受到一點傷或痛苦的感覺。否則地球上所有一切的東西，經它貫穿以後，都變為放射性物質。這是一個多麽可怕的現象。道就要歸功於造物的微妙，它早已在我們的四周緊緊的包圍了一層大氣，不讓宇宙綫直接射入而减小它的密度及壽命。還有如流星衝進了大氣，也同樣給它以阻力，使它自己發熟燃燒至白熾或甚至化爲灰儘後落下，那就不會傷及人類了。所以我們要知道空氣並不是專爲我們呼吸而設的。</p>
<p>現在再談每一個單獨的介子，它所含的能量有二十萬萬電子伏特，而Gamma射綫所有的能量，都只有二百萬電子伏特，故介子的能量較Gamma射綫的能量大一千倍。假使利用這些能來製成武器，那不就是比原子彈的成力大一千倍麽？</p>
<p>美國加州大學敎授密里根（Robert　A．Millikan）和其他科學家用實驗來證實宇宙射錢確是從各星球間發出的。他們又發現宇宙射綫能受地球磁塲的影響而彎曲。</p>
<p>最近奇異公司實驗所（General　Elecrtic　Research　Laboratory）的科學家宣稱已能用人工方法產生介子，這是他們用一架能產生十萬萬伏特的電子加速器所造成的。那末，我們離開可以利用宇宙射綫能的時候漸近了。到那時，我們又從原子能時代邁步走進了宇宙綫能的時代了。科學進步是沒有止境的！</p>
<p>科學漫談</p>
<h3>漫談塵埃</h3>
<p>— 葉鐳</p>
<p>從天窗透進的一道陽光中，可以看見無數的塵埃：活躍地飛揚　；當微風拂過的時候，也可以看見成羣的塵埃，霧一般地瀰漫着。我們旣然生活在這塵埃裏，對於塵埃就應該有個淸楚的認識。現在讓我們來談談塵埃吧。</p>
<p>嚴裕的說起來，塵埃可分爲兩種：大的肉眼可以看見的，呌做「灰塵」：小的肉眼看不見的，呌做「微塵」。塵埃的分佈，根據硏究報吿：鄉村較城市爲少；高空較低空爲少；早晨較傍晚爲少。</p>
<p>因爲塵坎中含有很多的病原菌，所以大家都厭惡它。平常我們生活在其中，眞如媽談生活在垃圾堆裏一樣，似乎一點也不覺得。</p>
<p>塵埃對於人類雖然有害，但是人類却少不了它。尤其是微塵，它對於人類的貢獻很大。</p>
<p>你相信嗎？微塵能够替天空佈置蔚藍色的背景。點綴那綺麗的彩霞。</p>
<p>因爲天空中飄浮着很多的微塵，這些微塵，好像鏡子，能够反射光綫；從太陽射出來的光綫，含有赤橙黃綠藍靛紫等的七色光波；就中波長較短的藍色光波，最容易被微塵所反射，映入我們的眼簾，所以天空呈現蔚藍的顏色。不過可惜對於我們有益的紫外綫，也因此而减弱，這是美中不足。</p>
<p>常陽光穿過密度較大的或顆粒較大的微塵時，對於波長較長的黃色光波和紅色光波，也有反射的作用，尤其是太陽斜照的時候，光綫所穿過的空間較多，受到微塵的反射也較多，因此形成綺麗的彩霞，特別的呈現在傍晚和早晨。</p>
<p>白天，靠着塵埃的漫射，每個角落裏都照得明亮。假使沒有塵埃，除了太陽照到的地方外，恐怕都要變爲黑暗世界了。同時强烈的宇宙射綫，將直射到地球表面，影響生物的生存。</p>
<p>飛行員在高空飛行的時候，往往仰見天空是黑喑的，並且星高空中微塵稀少，缺乏物體反射光綫使陝入他們的眼簾，所以能看到的是一片黑暗。在這黑暗中飛行，好像在夜裏一樣，星光當然能够看到。</p>
<p>遊山玩水的詩人，時常讀美潭水的碧綠可愛。關於這，過去曾經誤解是水的表面反射天空的藍色所成，後來美國加利福尼亞大學的物理學敎授的金斯等，利用光波偵察潛水艇的時候，才發現水中也含有很多的微塵，日光射入水中，同樣的因這些微塵的反射而呈藍色。</p>
<p>塵埃除了替大自然繪成一幅變幻莫測的美麗的圖畫外，對於雨點的形成，也有重要的作用。</p>
<p>我們知道向玻璃上呵氣，水汽和玻璃接觸後，才能凝結成水點，這事實吿訴我們，水汽必須和較冷的固體接觸後，才能凝結，否則即使溫度降低，也不會凝結的。</p>
<p>大氣中的水汽，到了飽和狀態，如果溫度降到露點以下，便以微塵爲中心，凝結成水點，這些水點，再慢慢增大，至受到地心引力的吸引，便落下成爲「雨」；所以微塵是水汽凝結的必須物，這些微塵，叫做「凝核」。</p>
<p>假使沒有了微塵，大氣中的水汽，將隨時凝結在任何固體的表面，如黃梅時節一樣，萬物以及我們自己的身體，都要沉沒在潮濕中。</p>
<p>混沌之初，地球的表面，經過長時期的風化，才有所謂「塵挾」；後來，一部份的塵埃，又慢慢地變成膠體，這種膠體，可能就是生物的開始。你不信嗎？當隕鐵竄入大氣的時候，被大氣消磨了，成爲成千成萬鐵的微塵，懸浮空中，再靠着日光的作用，變爲植物業中的葉綠素，更經過我們消化器的精煉，才變爲血液中的赤血球。這樣看來，塵埃或許就是製造生物的原始原料。希望大家認識塵埃認識它對於人類的關係。</p>
<h3>火箭砲的種種</h3>
<p>— 晨風</p>
<p>講到火箭砲的歷史，其實還是我們中國首先發明的。因爲火箭砲的原理和中國的「高升」一樣是利用火藥在燃燒以後產生的氣體的反動力將物體衝上天空再爆炸，在步槍沒有發明以前，火箭砲存歐洲已應用過了，但缺點是沒法校正爆炸的時間，並且藥綫露於空中易於潮濕，因此等步槍發明以後這一問題的硏究就給擱起來了。</p>
<p>大約在一九三〇年在北平西山有人試驗火箭砲，據說能放四千呎高，但也許因爲試驗的是巾一國人，政府方面認爲總有些靠不住，所以未加重視。</p>
<p>一九三二年以前，德國有許多火箭社，施用火箭砲，要想探測高空氣象，希特勒登台後，把這些集團放在一個軍車機關之下從事硏究。從一九三二年至一九三八年，得到初步的成功，但大規模的應用還需要很多改進。</p>
<p>美國一向祗有私人從事研究，在一九三七年，有個老敎授曾在沙漢中作公開試驗，但因當時美國尙未參戰，私家軍火商認爲不能賺錢，因此無人過問。直到一九四○年，才有規模較大的試驗。當時加雀理工大學（C．I．T．）航空系的五個學生（內一個加拿大人，一個南斯拉夫人，一個中國人即現任淸華大學航空系敎授錢偉長）集合了幾萬元從事初步硏究。</p>
<p>一九四二年，德國的　V1和V2開始出現。V1是利用火箭砲的原理，加以航空上的助力而施，在一九三八年已有成就，但因美國大規模的轟炸，阻礙了V2的大量製造。V2的成功，一方面保全了許多德國空軍人員的生命，同時由於牠的高速度（每時三六〇〇哩）使英國的高射砲束手無策。</p>
<p>蘇聯在一九三八年起，一直從事火箭砲的研究，一九四○年起，由於感受德國重砲的威脅，才從事近距離火箭砲（三十——五十哩）的硏究。它的優點申是發射時無反作用力量，不需笨重的砲架，因此在戰塲上的機動性很火，常蘇軍大舉反攻時，曾運用二三百架火箭砲，在德軍陣地上打開一個十哩寬，二十哩深的大缺口。</p>
<p>美國的火箭砲也是近距離的，有一種可射七千公尺遠，它的優點是製造成本低，携帶輕便。一九四三年，在美國軍艦上裝置一種稱爲Private的小型火箭砲，能射七至十五哩。後來又有種Private　D．，可射二十五至三十哩，巳超出了重砲的射程。而且普通的重砲，因爲反動力大，必需裝在主力艦上，而火箭砲沒有反作用力，不需裝在大船上，因此小型軍艦就成爲海軍中最主要的部份。</p>
<p>美國最近製造的一種火箭砲稱爲Wac　Corporal，係用液體爲燃料，其外體有一呎直徑，十六呎長，頭部尖圓，尾部有平衡現已减爲五百磅，這種火箭主要的用途在探測高空氣象，液體燃料裝在尾部的鋼質燃燒室，用發烟硝酸爲氯化劑，阿尼林（Aniline）爲燃料，火箭埀直置於發射架上，尾部離地約半尺，焚射時用遠距離控制，當燃料與氣化劑接觸時，使盛燃料的桶因發生氣體而增高壓力，當溫度爲二千六百度攝氏，壓力爲每平方吋三磅時，氣體推開尾部活門，將火箭砲推之上升，砲彈上昇的高度，據佔計可至四十三哩，實際上也許不止，普通的雲一哩高，汽球能昇至十二哩，我們目前所能知道的氣象，部在十二里以上，要探測十二哩以上的高度，就非用雷達不可了。</p>
<p>火箭砲不一定是殺人利器，它的發展到現在還不過是初步階段，火箭砲米來的改進對於高空氣候的探測將有不小的貢獻。</p>
<p>月球環繞地球旋轉，站在地心吸力和離心力平衡的地位，我們如果能施放一種火箭砲，達到這一平衡層，那麼這個砲彈就能浮游在空中，假使我們裝上各種儀器，就能測知高空氣象了，但要達到這一平衡層，至少須離地一百至二百哩，這個火箭砲的初速必需要每秒四哩，在目前的技術情形之下，還不能做到，因爲我舞還沒有發明適合於這樣高溫度（五二〇〇度）和壓力的材料，有一天，原子能應用成功之後，這目的就可達到了。</p>
<h3>飢餓的科學</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉麟</p>
<p>飢餓與疼痛，恐懼及忿怒，是決定生物活動的基本原因。「解決飢餓」是生物界最重要的問題之一。「愁腸飢火日相煎」（元好問）「倘爲飢火驅，平地豈無飯。」（范成大）將飢餓的感覺寫成「飢火」，眞不算誇大，因爲這一團飢火確可驅使人們奔走四方，犯罪殺人，幹自己所不頤幹的事。</p>
<p>久飢不餓一般人或許以爲飢餓的難受，是隨着時間而加强，直至餓死爲止。但是事實却與我們的想像大不相同，飢餓的感覺僅不渦幾天的工夫，就要消失，以後你不再感到飢餓了。</p>
<p>科西嘉島（Corsica）的一位律師韋台畢（Viterbi）因爲政治事件而判處死刑，他決意斷絕飲食，以免刑戮之苦。在他最後生活的十八天中，他留下了細心的日記，在第三天飢餓的感覺就沒有了，以後亁渴雖時常感到，但飢餓則永不復現。</p>
<p>飢餓的起因誰都知道「肚皮空了」是飢餓的起因，但是肚皮空（意思是胃部空虛）並不能解釋飢餓的感覺。胃洗過以後的一小時至二小時間內，不會感到飢餓，這時候胃部當然是空空如也的了。</p>
<p>有人猜想飢餓的悶痛是空胃中分泌出的鹽酸所致，不過事實上缺乏根據。絕食的時候空胃並不分泌　酸；而口患胃液缺乏症（Achylis　Gastrica）的人仍然有飢餓的感覺。所以鹽酸不能說明飢餓的起因。</p>
<p>也有人創一學說：「飢餓是起於胃腺的腫脹。如果繼續絕食，飢餓便歸於消滅，就是因為胃腺全部耗損，腹脹遂得平復的原故。胃部受到食物，胃腺的腫脹立能平復，而飢餓也即解除。」但是胃腺的脹縮似乎太玄妙，這個學說仍然沒有科學根據。</p>
<p>胃壁收縮的結果　百年前韋伯爾（Weber）曾說：「空虛的胃，四週筋肉作強力的收縮，以致胃腔亡失，這就引起了我們所謂飢餓感覺的一部。」</p>
<p>這句話已由華希本（Washburn）給予實騐的證明：華希本在他自己的食道中通過一條橡皮管，一直引到胃裏，管的下端附有一個大的軟橡皮球。實騐的時候，將橡皮球輕輕用氣吹眼，接上壓力計和浮記器（Float　Recordey）這些巧妙的裝置，可以把胃部的動作很靈敏地記錄下來。</p>
<p>華希本未覺餓飢以前，和飢餓感覺已經消失的時候，由胃動記錄的曲綫顯示胃壁並不收縮。但常華希本感到飢餓來襲時，胃壁強烈的收縮記錄就明明白白的顯示出來。</p>
<p>華希本這種吃飽了白米飯尋煩惱的實騐，終於證明了飢餓的起因。</p>
<h3>突變是化學性的改變嗎？</h3>
<p>— 郝天和</p>
<p>由短波輻射或化學反應所產生突變的差異，是由於這兩方面引起反應所施能量的不同。短波的輻射能，通常是够强大了，可以使因基的構造，發生一種劇烈的改變，從一種穩定的佈置，轉變到另一種的佈置，在另一方面，因基受了化學藥品所起的反應，因爲包含較小的能量，可以產生不太激烈的改變，即將因基轉移到一種適中的相當穩定的佈置，實際上凡是經過化學藥品處理之後，因基多少要受變動，使原來隱定的因基，產生一種新的不穩定的因基了。</p>
<p>自從用芥子氣得到第一次正的結果以來，研究化學的突變素的工作，逐漸　展，所找的物質，不論在牠的化學構造方面，取則在牠們的藥理作用方面，都和芥子氣有關係的，芥子氣具有非常的滲透力量，又是一種原生質的固定　，具有這兩種性質的物品不一定就是一種突變素，所以能影響突變的決不是　　（Osmic　acid）也不是苦味酸（Picric　acid）因為動物體經過這兩種酸處理之後，都要被殺死的，同時也不能說每種有力的靡　性毒氣都是突變素。因爲路氏芥子氣（Lewisite）在兩個CIB試臉中，完全顯出負的結果。直到現在爲止，祇找到三種化物質，能够得到與芥子氣一樣的效果。牠們都屬於這類含氮或含硫的芥子氣，牠們的化學分于式如下：（一）O（CH2·CH2·S·CH2·CH2·CD2，（二）N（CH2·HC2·CD3及（三）N（CH2·CH2·CD·2</p>
<p>假定化學的突變素，對於因基中的物質，能够直接起作用，那麽，這件事勢必引人注意。而感到興趣的，就是那些活潑的化合物，都含有一個不飽和的原子，（：硫或一氣）這個原子也許能和組成因基的物質互相化合，這種化合物的活動力，將隨糜爛性芥子氣的旁鏈如CLCH2·CH2等等的種類而變更，此種的構造，協同了分子內的環狀化的趨向，就造成了葱精（Onium）的化合物，這類化合物，因爲含有氮（…N）或硫（:S）比較的活潑，假定突變素的作用是由於因基和化合物巾尙未飽和的原子所引起的反應，那麼可以預料到用氧（：O）去替換硫（：S）和氣（…N）不會產生活潑的物質。因爲加入二價的　所成的化合物，在水溶液中是不穩定的。（並具氣芥子氣：O　Mustard不是一種糜爛性毒氣）然而穩定的化合物，必需要含碳氯羣的化合化物所組成的，相當於碳氯芥子氣（CO　Mustard）可惜尙未試過。至於催淚性毒氣，氯化丙酮（Chloracetone）和二氯化丙酮（Dichloracctone）（具有CICH2——旁鏈的化合物，替代了芥子氣中的CICH2·CH2——）都被觀察過了，這類化合物的活動力，是非常徽弱的，事實上，沒有得到很清楚的正的結果，雖然這兩種化合物，可能含有輕微的突變紫性質的，含硫的化合物與氯化乙基丙酮（Chlorcthylacctone）雖則同樣有繫爛作用，但是後者的力量也許比較活潑些。但是要用這類化合物去作試驗現在還是不可能的。（待續）</p>

<h3>The National Army in Siping Reaches Changchun; Communist Bandits Waver Around Yongji; Sixth Offensive Utterly Fails</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 2nd] After land communication between Shenyang and Changchun was completely opened on the 1st, the National Army is rapidly advancing, and the Northeast war has entered a stage of significant change. General Pan Yu-kun, commander of the New First Army, who had been stationed in Siping for a whole month to command operations, returned to Changchun by car from Fanjiatun this afternoon. Staff Officer Shi Shuo accompanied him. The people were extremely excited to see the endless stream of vehicles entering the city from the south, believing that a new phase in the Changji battle had begun. General Pan told reporters: "We welcome the communist bandits to attack strongholds." But the communist bandits really do not have the courage and strength. The battles of Dehui and Siping are major lessons they have not forgotten. General Pan, though showing signs of fatigue from the battlefield, was in high spirits. It is reported that Generals Pan and Shi flew to Shenyang and then transferred to Siping on October 2nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] The National Army under Pan Yu-kun, which won brilliant victories in the southern section of Chang-Shen last month, arrived in Changchun from Siping on the 2nd. The unit's seven columns, equipped with high-speed mechanized equipment, covered the 270 li distance between Siping and Changchun in 36 hours, overcoming layers of obstruction from the bandit army along the way in Caijia, Gongzhuling, Fanjiatun and other places, killing and wounding more than 2,000 bandits. (Another dispatch) After the entire Chang-Pan line was completely opened, the remnant bandits along the Ping-Mei line are expected to be cleared soon, and the Jilin war situation is becoming increasingly stable.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 2nd] The National Army, which joined forces in Fanjiatun, is sweeping up remnant bandits in the area west of Gongzhuling and Fanjiatun. When the National Army moving north from Siping attacked Gongzhuling at 3:00 AM on the 1st, the bandits were fast asleep and nearly a thousand were eliminated, with over two hundred captured alive. The bandits in Gongzhuling can be said to have been completely wiped out.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 3rd] Jilin has been besieged for eighteen days and nights since the 16th. However, last night and today, the surroundings were quiet with no major fighting. It is reported that the main force of the Second Column of bandits attacking the southwestern suburban positions has withdrawn from the battlefield and retreated towards the Daishui River. The bandit forces around all the fronts are also wavering. Our air force flew in search of bandit traces this morning before dawn, taking advantage of the moonlight, and continued throughout the day. The sounds of bombing and strafing gradually faded. Our ground forces are preparing to counterattack. It is reported that after being scattered on the Middle East Railway, the communist bandits concentrated their remaining forces to besiege Jilin, in an attempt to slightly reverse the decline. Unexpectedly, after eighteen days, they have lost 20,000 troops without gaining an inch. Thus, their sixth offensive has come to a complete and utter failure.</p>

According to a military report released on the battle of Tuanshanzi: the bandits used the main force of the First Column, the 33rd, 66th, and 77th Regiments, and the Independent First Division, totaling about ten thousand men, with more than 30 mountain and field guns, launching more than ten fierce attacks on our positions from all sides from dusk onward. The fighting was unprecedentedly fierce. The defending troops fought bravely. By midnight, the ground around Tuanshanzi and the trenches were filled with bandit corpses, estimated at over three thousand.

In particular, the defenders of Tuanshanzi, with their unwavering spirit and courage, have achieved a great victory with fewer troops against a larger enemy. I am greatly gratified. I hope you will continue to inspire your subordinates and further display our fearless spirit to annihilate the stubborn bandits."</p>

<p>[Reuters, Nanking, 2nd] Military, political, and economic officials here believe that the US Military Advisory Group's training of Chinese soldiers in Taiwan is not the beginning of US military or financial aid to China.

Furthermore, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie stated that the expansion of the US Military Advisory Group's activities to Taiwan is not related to the US loan policy toward China. Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, believes that this move is not related to US financial or economic aid, or is an action taken in accordance with the newly established US military policy.</p>

<h3>British Delegation to China Flies to Canton Today; Discusses Impressions of China at Press Conference Yesterday; Makes Statement on Our Navigation Rights Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Nanking Dispatch, 2nd] The British delegation to China held a press conference at the International Club on the second floor at 10:00 AM on the 2nd.

<h3>Hu Shih Busily Lectures; After Advocating Vernacular Chinese, Discusses Merchants</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 2nd] Hu Shih has been actively lecturing recently. Yesterday, he attended two events and gave what he called "extra lectures." One was at the Peiping-Tientsin Railway Bureau, where he talked about the vernacular Chinese movement. He said that this movement originated from a discussion about old poetry with a classmate when he was studying in the United States. He stated that Chinese literature has an upper-level literature of classical Chinese and a lower-level literature of vernacular Chinese. The vernacular Chinese gradually became popular after the May Fourth Movement. He said that "Mandarin" became the national language because 90% of the country is a Mandarin-speaking area, and 75% of the population speaks Mandarin. From Harbin in the far northeast to Kunming, they all speak Mandarin. 300 million people speak one language, which is unprecedented in the world. Finally, he emphasized that official documents should also be quickly changed to vernacular Chinese. Hu Shih's other lecture was at the Merchants' Festival celebration in Peiping. Hu Shih said that his grandfather was also a merchant, so he was willing to take a stand as a descendant of merchants and advocated that merchants should strive for equality and no longer be exploited, and overthrow the Confucian traditional idea of despising merchants as "those who eat without plowing and wear without weaving." Hu Shih also cited Sima Qian's "Biographies of Money-Makers," saying that wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the creeds that merchants should believe in, and extended to say that today's merchants should have great wisdom.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Has a Bumper Cotton Harvest This Year; Transportation and Cash Are Two Major Problems</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 2nd] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation, arrived in Xi'an by air from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 1st to inspect the cotton production situation in various places. A reporter came along. It is reported that Shaanxi Province has improved cotton seeds this year, and the area planted is as large as 3 million mu. The estimated output can reach 880,000 dan, of which 80% has already been harvested. Currently, the market price here is only about 2 million yuan per dan. The biggest difficulties at present are transportation problems and cash shortages. Taking the Textile Construction Corporation's purchase of cotton as an example, 60% of the cotton payment needs to be paid by check, and the cash discount is 10%. The market price of yarn and cloth here has been stable recently. The Shanghai New 20-count yarn is 23.5 million per piece, and the local Dahua Yanta cloth is 1.02 million per bolt. General Chennault came here weeks ago to negotiate the air transport of Shaanxi cotton and had discussions with the provincial government. It is reported that the planned plan is to dispatch one aircraft to travel between Shaanxi and Shanghai every day, which can fly from Xi'an to Shanghai four times a week, carrying 5.5 tons of cotton each time, and can transport about 88 tons per month. The return trip from Shanghai to Xi'an is loaded with daily necessities. It is heard that the contract for this air transport of materials can be signed in Shanghai within days. Furthermore, the Northwest Industrial Company of Henan Province is also in contact with the Air Transport Brigade to load daily necessities in Shanghai and fly to Zhengzhou. After unloading in Zhengzhou, the return flight flies to Xi'an to transport cotton to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>US Takes Aid to China Measures; Marshall Can Decide Before Going to England</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] US Secretary of State Marshall will decide whether the US should continue to provide aid to China in order to strengthen its central government and curb the expansion of the Communist Party. This matter may be decided before Mr. Marshall goes to London later this month to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to official statements today, the Chinese issue is a major emergency issue. Washington has received reports that American authorities in Nanking believe that in order to save China from disaster, Chairman Chiang and his hard-fighting army must be given aid early next year. Marshall has ordered his senior staff and advisors to find ways to provide the Chinese government with limited financial and economic assistance, such as relief supplies, and to strengthen the strength of the National Army. Marshall, who previously served in China as President Truman's special envoy, has kept aid to China to a minimum since returning home, providing only a batch of bullets a few months ago. The US's limited assistance is in compliance with the so-called "no action" policy here, pending the reorganization of the National Government itself, transferring more power to the hands of the moderates that Marshall believes in. Although some of these leaders have been appointed, the impression gained by the State Department is that they have no real power. Marshall's main goal of liberating the Chinese government has not yet been achieved. In fact, the communist direction is slightly the opposite. Earlier this week, the Chinese government banned the Democratic League. What the US authorities are focusing on seems to be the only real force in China other than the Democratic League and the Chinese Communist Party. Currently, US policy toward China is deeply involved in the conflict between the US and the Soviet Union, which is a basic fact, but there has been no formal evidence here that the CCP is being actively supplied or directed by the Soviet Union. One point that the US is considering is to limit its aid to China in some form so as not to provoke an open struggle between the US and the Soviet Union in China. Marshall's study of the Chinese situation is largely based on the survey report recently submitted by General Mai. This report is locked in a safe in the State Department, labeled top secret, but there is no doubt in the official mind that Wei proposed that the United States give China broad assistance, or even broader than Marshall and the State Department are willing to give at this time.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Cautious First General Election</h3>
<p>The elections for National Assembly representatives, legislators, and supervisors are soon to be held successively. The Shanghai Municipal Election Committee will meet tomorrow to review the qualifications of candidates running for National Assembly representative, and the list of candidates nominated by political parties is expected to be announced on the 6th. This demonstrates the government's active preparation for the election. However, this election is the first of its kind since the National Assembly formulated the Constitution. Its gains and losses not only concern the democratic style of Chinese politics going forward, but also the future of constitutional government in China will depend on this election. As the saying goes, "Be cautious in the initial planning of a matter." This election is the first step in China's political journey toward democracy, and it must be handled with special care. When the Shanghai Municipal Council was about to close, it also passed a temporary motion to "request the government to handle the general election with special caution." When Councilor Tao Baichuan delivered a reply on behalf of all councilors, he also said: "Shanghai will soon elect representatives to the National Assembly, legislators, and supervisors. We hope that we can fulfill the task of being a flat mirror so that we can hope that they can be a microscope and telescope." Therefore, in order to enable China's politics to truly embark on the path of democracy, we cannot but hope that this general election can be handled with caution to establish a new style of democratic politics.</p>
<p>First, we must make the whole country, from top to bottom, cherish and love this Constitution, which was exchanged for blood and flesh. Leaving aside the constitutional movement at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the constitutional history of the early Republic of China, even from the process of the Legislative Yuan starting to draft the Constitution, the birth of this Constitution is unknown how much effort legal scholars have put in? In terms of the time experienced, it lasted for 15 years, from February 1933 to the public announcement on New Year's Day 1947, which is unmatched by the Constitution of any country. Therefore, when Chairman Chiang submitted the draft Chinese Constitution to the National Assembly for deliberation, he said: "This draft Constitution submitted today can be said to have been prepared with the blood and tears of the military and civilians of the whole country for the past 50 years." I remember that the convening of the National Assembly also went through many twists and turns. The established date of convening was also postponed repeatedly, for a total of five times. Even at the last time, it still failed to be held as scheduled and had to be postponed for another three days. From this, it can be seen that this Constitution was not easy to create. Now that we have a Constitution that has emerged from difficulties, it is not easy to deal with. Every word and sentence is hard work and effort. How can we not cherish it especially! Looking at the content of this Constitution, it was made under the meticulous and thorough research and repeated deliberation of many experts and scholars. It not only has lofty ideals, catering to the new trend of the world after the war; but also can take into account the actual situation of domestic politics and the needs of society; to be honest, this is the newest Constitution in the world after the war. How can we allow it to become a dead letter and not cherish it? However, the value of the Constitution lies in its implementation. Our love for the Constitution lies in enabling the provisions stipulated in this Constitution to be realized. The National Assembly is the only organ for implementing the Constitution. How can we not be cautious about the election of National Assembly representatives?</p>
<p>Second, we must enable the whole country, from top to bottom, to understand that the democratization of Chinese politics should seek progress through learning, and we are currently in the initial stage of learning. Although our country's political thought is full of democratic ideas, because the politics of past dynasties have been a kind of enlightened monarchy, there has been no democratic polity until today. Only today do we have a democratic Constitution, and only then can we implement constitutional government. Most people are not very clear about the use of democratic constitutional government, let alone use it freely; especially for elections, they do not know what it is. People with the right to vote do not know the value of the right to vote and cherish this vote: People running for election often do not know how to win the sympathy of voters with policy programs, but want to exchange money and wine for voters' votes. This phenomenon is of course unavoidable in democratic advanced countries; but we still hope that Chinese politics can catch up with the support of the production, and never let this kind of malpractice occur. However, in order to avoid this malpractice, various parties implement a party nomination system. The Kuomintang adopts the method of designating candidates for the election of party comrades, and does not allow comrades of the party to freely compete for election. According to the Kuomintang's consistent spirit, it has always adopted a system of democratic centralism. Party members can freely express their opinions and participate in discussions on the party's decisions before they are made; but after the decisions are made, party members can only obey. Recently, a few party members, dissatisfied with the state-designated method, advocated free competition. We believe that this view is wrong. The so-called democratic politics must go through the relationship of political parties to show the direction of public opinion. Taking the election of members of the US Congress as an example, people only know the party when they vote, and do not know the person. The success of the Republican candidate in the election in New York State is the victory of the Republican Party, not the personal success of the candidate. If comrades of a party are allowed to compete freely, it will not only weaken the strength of the party, but also cause disputes within the party. However, we also hope that the responsible supervisors in charge of the designation can handle affairs with an attitude of impartiality and selflessness, and separately review the candidate's qualifications and their reputation in the local area, and take this as the standard for selection. At the same time, we also hope that the supervisors can not participate in the election in principle, so as to avoid the suspicion of "designating themselves."</p>
<p>Third, we must make all candidates in the country aware of the current Chinese politics. The so-called "difficulties are everywhere" has indeed reached the most serious period; all future hopes are pinned on the constitutional National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan: After the general election, whether the National Assembly can start anew with the people and make the whole country look new is the responsibility of the newly elected National Assembly representatives, legislators, and supervisors. All those who are enthusiastically participating in the election now should remain calm in their enthusiasm, and reflect on their own motives for running for election? Is it for the country and the people? Or is it only for personal prominence? We do not object to capable people participating in the election so that they can shoulder the task of nation-building, but we do not approve of participating in the election solely for personal advancement to achieve personal desires. However, from the perspective of a third party, it is difficult to distinguish their inner motives; and enthusiastically participating in the election is ultimately a good phenomenon from a democratic perspective. However, people participating in the election should have a democratic style. They must not only be able to withstand the criticism of the people, but also always adopt an attitude of concession, and not think that failure is a shame and success is an honor. If this can be done, not only will malpractices not emerge endlessly, but election disputes can also be reduced.</p>
<p>In short, we the people need to learn democratic politics in practice, and the government should handle the first general election with caution to avoid malpractices and establish a new style of democracy and lay the foundation for constitutional government in our country.</p>

<h3>British Delegation to China Hosts Journalists</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Then, Lindsay, a member of the delegation, answered questions, saying: "Regarding the current situation in Northeast and North China, because I have not been to the Communist areas and battlefields, I have no understanding and cannot comment." He also avoided mentioning his remarks about suppressing the Communists in Ping. As for the government's announcement that the Democratic League is an illegal organization, they do not have a clear understanding of the Democratic League. If the Democratic League is indeed a part of the Communist Party, then it will not be able to become an independent democratic political party, and the government's measures should have sufficient reasons. Regarding the issue of the administrative efficiency of the Chinese government, he said that any government should improve its administrative efficiency at any time. Finally, Robert said that after they return to their country, they will introduce the situation in China to the British people. British agricultural implements are most suitable for small and medium-sized farming, but he does not know under what circumstances the British government can discuss with the Chinese government on how to assist in this matter. He solemnly stated that British foreign policy will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and does not want any country to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. He believes that Marshal Ma's mediation of the Chinese political struggle last year was obtained with the consent of both parties, and was definitely not an interference in internal affairs. As for the point of arms aid, whether it is suspected of interference, he refused to comment. Robert also reiterated on behalf of the delegation that this trip is a purely friendly visit, with no task of negotiating on any particular matter, nor of criticizing the foreign policy of other countries. After being in China for many days, they have been warmly received by the Chinese government and people, and are very grateful. After the press conference, the group of six went to the British Embassy to rest for a while. At 11:30, accompanied by Ambassador Stevenson and Wang Jihui, a member of the Bin Department of our country, they went to the No. 1 official residence of the Executive Yuan to bid farewell to President Zhang and took a photo as a memento. After leaving, they went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Foreign Minister Wang and were invited to a luncheon. From 5:00 to 7:00 in the afternoon, the delegation held a cocktail party at the International Friendship Association to bid farewell to celebrities from all walks of life in our country. At 8:00 in the evening, Indian Ambassador Menon hosted a farewell banquet.</p>

Within one week after the completion of the receipt, they shall register the names and quantities of the items, and report them to the Ministry, and publish them in the local newspapers. If there are any shortages, damages, mildew, or rot, they shall be noted in detail item by item. After the receipt, the director of the bureau or other receiving personnel shall be responsible for proper custody, and shall not move them. It is strictly forbidden to convert them into administrative expenses. After the receipt, a detailed distribution plan shall be formulated for the received materials within two weeks, and submitted to the Ministry for approval and distribution. Before the approval is obtained, no one shall be allowed to arbitrarily dispose of or distribute them. The aforementioned distribution plan shall be jointly considered and formulated with the local public opinion organs, local impartial persons, and relevant relief agencies and organizations, and strive for openness and rationality. The received relief materials shall be distributed to the hands of those in need of relief as soon as possible before the end of this year. Even in special circumstances, they must be completed and distributed before the Spring Festival next year. The distribution shall be carried out jointly by personnel from relevant agencies and organizations to ensure that it is effective. The distribution of materials, the amount of distribution, and the recipients of relief shall be recorded in detail, and submitted to the Ministry for verification before the end of January next year, so that they can be forwarded to the Executive Yuan, and distributed to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and published in the central and local newspapers. The Ministry will send personnel to guide and check the receipt and distribution of relief materials in various places at any time, and the results of the handling will be an important basis for the performance evaluation of the directors of the bureaus, and will be rewarded or punished accordingly. All of the above items must be strictly followed, especially items two and three, which should be given special attention. If there are any changes, shortages, or arbitrary distribution, the director of the bureau or other receiving personnel shall be fully responsible.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Chinese Immigration to Siam</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) According to Siam, when it planned to announce the implementation of immigration quotas in April of this year, it only allowed 10,000 immigrants from China per year, and 200 from other countries. Because the Siamese side had never restricted the immigration of our people in the past, and in the past, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese entered Siam every year, in view of the actual needs and to maintain the traditional relationship between the two peoples, our Ambassador to Siam, Li, repeatedly negotiated with the Siamese side. Later, with the consent of the Siamese Prime Minister, it was tentatively decided that the immigration quota for this year, from May to the end of the year, would be 10,000 people, and the number of immigrants after next year would be discussed separately. Unexpectedly, after the implementation, the Siamese Immigration Bureau suddenly made another interpretation, saying that the immigration quota for China this year was 10,000 people. After deducting the number of people who entered Siam from January to April, the actual quota from May to the end of the year was only 6,667 people. Our government could not agree to this interpretation that did not conform to the agreement between the two parties, and the Siamese side notified us of the full quota in advance, and suddenly sent back to China the overseas Chinese who they believed to be over quota, which was even more unreasonable. Therefore, after our serious negotiations, the Siamese government has agreed not to send back the overseas Chinese who have already arrived in Siam. As for the point of which month the quota of 10,000 should be counted from, negotiations are still ongoing.</p>

<h3>Prices in Yan'an Soar; Eggs Cost 10,000 Yuan Each</h3>
<p>[Report from our Xi'an Office on the 2nd] A person from Yan'an said: Prices have recently soared in the area, which is shocking. Shanghai cigarettes cost 230,000 each, eggs cost 10,000 each, and flashlight batteries cost 150,000 per pair, which may have set the highest record in the country. However, material enjoyment is very high, and the consumption of foreign wine, coffee, and Western food is in stark contrast to the eleven kiln mud caves, and private silk has also appeared.</p>
<h3>Most of China's Exported Bristles are Smuggled to Hong Kong; US Department of Commerce Releases Trade Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The US Department of Commerce released a report stating that the United States imported more than half of the 2,395,000 pounds of Chinese bristles exported by China in the second quarter of this year. The value of the bristles exported by China during this period was US$7,596,000. According to reports from the US consuls in Chongqing and Qingdao, many Chinese bristle exporters are evading normal foreign trade channels and smuggling bristles to Hong Kong in exchange for higher profits. The US consul in Chongqing did not sign any bristle export applications in the first half of this year, while the US consul in Qingdao signed 160 bristle export applications from January to March this year, worth approximately 65 million yuan. The Department of Commerce reported on the bristle trade in Hong Kong, stating that almost all of the bristles arriving in Hong Kong were believed to have been transported through Chinese smuggling routes. It also stated that although Hong Kong has never been an important supplier of bristles, the operation of this business in the area has increased several times compared to decades ago.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Prices Rise Again; Exports of Local Products Decline</h3>
<p>[Report from our Fuzhou Office on the 2nd] Prices in Fuzhou have risen again. Rice has risen by tens of thousands due to the reported rise in prices in the producing areas. It is sold for 621,000 per dan in retail stores, edible oil is sold for 1.67 million, and tung oil is sold for 1.8 million. In addition, the export trade of local products in Fuzhou in October has declined sharply. According to the Fuzhou branch of the Import and Export Association, the reason for this is that the difference between the black market gold notes and the market price is too far, and general exporters are hesitant to move forward. Secondly, the purchasing power of foreign markets has recently weakened, and the reputation of Chinese goods exports has not been widely established.</p>
<h3>The Tung Oil Loan for the Vegetable Oil Factory is Indeed 2.5 Billion Yuan</h3>

After the letter was sent to the Control Yuan for inquiry, it was replied that the number of the tung oil loan for the Vegetable Oil Factory was indeed "2.5 billion yuan." The words "two hundred" were a clerical error when copying by hand.</p>
<h3>China's Iron Ore Raw Materials to be Sold to Japan</h3>

This iron ore is given to Japan at a price of US$7 per ton, and the total value of the iron ore seedlings to be shipped this month is set at US$1.74 million. This money can enable China to repay part of the debt it recently incurred for purchasing locomotives and other exports from Japan. According to senior officials of our delegation to Japan, our country is currently preparing a method to transport iron ore and other raw materials to Japan.</p>

<h3>Behind the Iron Curtain • Farmlands Everywhere:  The Tragedy of an Agricultural Family</h3>
<p>— Eighth Letter from Poland, by Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>The greatest secret in the Warsaw area is undoubtedly the military cooperation between Poland and Russia. The International Propaganda Bureau of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided me with all sorts of information, with the sole exception of anything related to military affairs. They are even reluctant to fabricate a number for the current size of Poland's standing army. One thing, however, is consistently maintained by officials of all ranks in the Polish government. They say: there are no Russian troops stationed on Polish territory because Poland is a sovereign state, and they have all returned home after the war.</p>
<p>However, according to Baisha, the center of European rumors, everyone says that Russia is manipulating Poland. Today, Warsaw's internal affairs and diplomacy are blatantly connected to Moscow. When the Marshall Plan for European recovery was announced, Warsaw newspapers enthusiastically supported it. But the moment Molotov stormed away and left Paris, the left-wing Polish newspapers attacked the Marshall Plan with even more ferocity than Moscow, claiming that Marshall wanted to use the "gold standard" to control Europe as a tool for a white imperialist takeover of the continent. Whether these are the words that the "broad masses of people" want to say is another question. What we see is that every little move made by the Warsaw government is in line with Moscow's attitude, sometimes even "surpassing the master," shouting with a hundred times the intensity of the Russians.</p>
<p>The Polish Communist Party, now renamed the "Labor Party," is estimated to have less than one million members. Regardless of its history, strength, or skills, it is insufficient to completely control the 23 million Polish people. Therefore, it is very clear that behind the Polish Communist Party, there is so-called "external force" at play, which is the Russian military garrison.</p>
<p>A Polish Foreign Ministry official explained it to me in more detail, saying:</p>
<p>There are no regular Russian garrison troops stationed in Poland. The Russian soldiers that many foreign tourists see along the railway lines, and the fact that we are called a nation "behind the iron curtain," is purely due to geographical and transportation circumstances.</p>
<p>He said, "You, sir, came from Germany and have seen the vast Russian occupation zone within Germany. The arrival, departure, and demobilization of these large numbers of Russian troops must pass through Poland. The Polish government, out of wartime alliance and gratitude for Russia's help in Poland's restoration, naturally cannot refuse them transit. In particular, there are three main railway lines in Poland that were newly built by the Russian military."</p>
<p>He added, "Before the war, Russian and German railways were both 'broad gauge,' but most of Poland's were narrow gauge. To reduce the need for transshipment, the Polish government allowed Russia to build these three north-south arteries that traverse the country. Therefore, the management and station rights belong to the Russian military. That is why many people see Russian soldiers wearing red star caps."</p>
<p>I don't know if all of this is true, but in any case, this explanation is very reasonable. Poles, like Asians, "value face." For over nine hundred years, Polish history has been a tragedy on the European international stage. National subjugation, dependence, and flattery have caused many Poles to be unable to hold their heads high in international gatherings. However, I ultimately believe that this is not the fault of the Polish national character. The real cause of the Polish tragedy is still its agricultural economic life.</p>
<p>Before 1939, Hitler often sang the praises of "industrial Germany, agricultural Poland." Poland supplied Germany with raw materials, food, and all other agricultural products, and then bought industrial products from Germany, even weapons essential for national defense. Europe is the birthplace of modern civilization, which is to say, industrial civilization. Germany, in the Bismarck era, completed the industrial model. Russia, under Peter the Great, also established the path to industry. Even Czechoslovakia, separated from Poland by the Carpathian Mountains, had the latest industrial base. Only Poland has never escaped its inherent nature as an "agricultural family." Before the First World War, Russia, Prussia, and Austria divided Poland, which in reality meant that three industrial countries controlled the ancient agricultural family on the Vistula River.</p>
<p>On my first day in Warsaw, Bao Jinpu (Yi), the chargé d'affaires at the embassy, told me, "Poland is currently the largest agricultural country in Europe. In a time of widespread food shortages in Europe, Poland's abundant agricultural products will amaze you." For more than ten days, I have been staying at the Bristol Hotel, with an endless supply of milk, bread, eggs, and butter. Polish restaurants, both large and small, cook like the Chinese, favoring "heavy oil," with even a layer of oil floating on the surface of the dishes. In midsummer, puppies and small blankets abound. Many "ice cream" shops, which they call "Lodzi," offer banana juice, bayberry juice, peach juice—all sorts of flavors. When the U.S. State Department sent a survey team to Europe to determine U.S. agricultural aid to each country, the head of the team, Mr. Halitt, ate and drank to his heart's content in Warsaw, and was extremely satisfied. He returned to Washington and reported to the State Department: "Poland has an abundance of agricultural products and does not need U.S. agricultural aid." (Continued on page 5)</p>

<h3>British Municipal Election Results:  Labor Party Suffers Unprecedented Defeat; Conservative Party Demands New Parliamentary Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd.  Due to the various shortcomings of the Labor government, voter dissatisfaction has clearly increased. The rightward shift in the recent municipal elections is likely due to this. The Conservative Party, led by Lord Woolton, has demanded that the government call for new parliamentary elections, a demand that the government will undoubtedly reject. Today, the government released a statement on the preliminary election results, saying that while the results are disappointing, they do not indicate a drastic shift in political trends. The Labor Party has achieved great and significant victories over the past two years, and even if five percent of the municipal council seats were to shift from Labor to the Conservative Party, it would not affect the overall situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Labor Party has suffered a major setback in the council elections in 400 towns and cities in England and Wales. The results of the one-day municipal elections announced this morning show: the Conservative Party gained 631 seats and lost 17; the Labor Party gained 42 seats and lost 683; the Liberal Party gained 46 seats and lost 36; the Communist Party gained none and lost 9; the Independents gained 170 seats and lost 134. Former Food Minister Lord Woolton, the current chairman of the Conservative Party, declared after the election results were announced: the rightward trend indicated by the municipal election results has only one meaning, and I believe that the government must acknowledge that the House of Commons no longer represents democratic political thought and must hold new elections. The municipal elections not only express the people's opinions on local affairs, but also their political views on national affairs. The one-sided nature of the election situation shows that the British people no longer trust a government that has broken its promises and cannot lead the country out of chaos. Many people believe that if the government could devote itself to the primary task of revitalizing the country, many of the difficulties they are currently facing could be avoided; and if national affairs could be handled by more capable people, many things, even if unpleasant, would still need to be forced upon the people. The results of the municipal elections indicate not only the people's distrust of the Labor government, but also the revitalization and the strength of the national Conservative Party organization. Note that Mr. Woolton made this formal Conservative Party response to the municipal election results in his capacity as chairman of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>The Labor Party has a majority of more than 140 seats over all other parties in the House of Commons. Yesterday's municipal elections show that the power held by the Labor Party has been seized by the Conservatives. The number of voters in each district ranged from 50 to 80 percent of the total electorate, which can be considered quite enthusiastic. The most severe blow suffered by the Labor Party was the loss of power in many large cities with extensive control over local finance, industry, commerce, and municipal affairs. For example, Manchester, Britain's largest industrial center, Birmingham, another industrial center, and York, Lancaster, Leeds, and other districts, were all taken from the Labor Party by the Conservatives. Voting in Scottish cities, the largest of which are Edinburgh and Glasgow, is scheduled for Tuesday. Elections in London will not be held until next year.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the U.S. Republican National Committee Vigorously Criticizes Truman, Saying That He Has Yielded to Radicals</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Reese, chairman of the Republican National Committee, denounced President Truman on the 2nd for equating high prices with foreign aid in his call for a special session of Congress. Reese said: "Truman's move is another concession to radicals, attempting to strengthen his position for next year's election by gaining their support."</p>
<p>[Picture Caption] Hussein, Vice-Chairman of the Arab League in Palestine (second from the right in the middle row), attends the UN Palestine Committee, declaring firm opposition to the partition plan. (Courtesy of the UN Office in Shanghai)</p>
<p>Reese said that Truman had assured Republican leaders that if a special session of Congress had to be called, the sole purpose would be to aid other countries. However, this is in line with the demands of radicals, who are demanding the restoration of the Office of Price Administration and other radical organizations. Therefore, when calling a special session, Truman should at least give the effort to combat domestic inflation as much importance as the emergency aid to Europe bill, if not more.</p>
<h3>European Countries Oppose the Establishment of Supervisory Agencies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] It is reported that Sir Franks, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Committee for European Economic Cooperation, which is discussing the Marshall Plan, recently visited Acting U.S. Secretary of State Lovett and gave him an informal memorandum, expressing the hope that U.S. officials who are drafting the Marshall Plan for European aid will not impose troublesome restrictions on the use by European governments of domestic currency obtained from the sale of materials obtained from the U.S. to their own people. Franks pointed out that any restrictions would necessarily differ from country to country, and that establishing independent agencies in each country to control these funds would hinder the government's control over its economy. It is also reported that the House Foreign Aid Committee, led by Representative Herter, is considering the establishment of a five-member committee consisting of members from the U.S. and each recipient country to monitor the use of funds.</p>
<h3>Allow Japan to Join the United Nations After the Formal Signing of the Peace Treaty:  Straightforward Statement by Our Representative Jiang Tingfu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 1st. United Press] United Press reporters recently asked several representatives to the Far Eastern Commission for their opinions on Japan. The Chinese representative supported accepting Japan as a formal member of the United Nations as soon as the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The Philippines strongly disagreed.</p>
<p>The Chinese representative, Jiang Tingfu, stated frankly that Japan should be allowed to join the United Nations as soon as the peace treaty with Japan is ratified. Although China fought Japan for more than ten years, it does not harbor permanent animosity towards Japan. After Japan has fulfilled all the obligations of a defeated nation, it must be allowed to stand in the international community. The Philippine representative, Romulo, completely disagreed with Jiang, saying that Japan should only be allowed to hold "probationary" status after the end of the peace conference with Japan. Japan should be considered for international status only after several years of "probation." Other major countries refused to answer this question. The Soviet representative, Ralomiko, said: "I have nothing to say on this matter."</p>
<h3>Final Results of French Municipal Elections</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] The Ministry of the Interior has announced the final results of the French municipal elections.

<h3>Turkey's Foreign Policy:  Promoting Good Neighborliness and Jointly Safeguarding Peace; Expressing Dissatisfaction with Unreasonable Demands from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 1st] Turkish President Inonu addressed the hundredth session of the Grand National Assembly today, pointing to the Soviet Union's rude accusations against Turkey. He said that Turkey is dissatisfied with its relations with the Soviet Union. Turkey tried to establish good relations with the Soviet Union, but was met with unreasonable accusations from the Soviet side. The Soviet Union reviews past and present events in an incorrect and unfair manner, and even makes unfair demands on Turkey.</p>
<p>After stating that the sole goal of Turkey's foreign policy is to achieve world peace and to assist as much as possible in the establishment of common security that all countries yearn for, Inonu discussed Turkey's relations with other countries individually. He said that Turkey's relations with Britain are very good, and Turkey deeply understands Britain's current difficulties and believes that it will win its current struggle soon. When mentioning the United States, Inonu said that this great democratic nation's decision to provide Turkey with aid proves its continuous efforts in the pursuit of peace. Turkey's relations with France are based on a long tradition of friendship and are still being actively developed. Turkey is also willing to strengthen its ties with Italy, and is deeply pleased that the new Italy has gradually restored its international status. When discussing domestic issues, Inonu said that the defense budget accounts for the largest portion of Turkey's new budget, and in view of certain circumstances, the defense budget may still not be able to meet all needs. He also emphasized that Turkey's main concern at present is to maintain its security.</p>

<h3>Next Session of the UN General Assembly to Be Held in Western Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] Authoritative sources declared today that the 1948 session of the United Nations General Assembly will likely be held in Paris, Geneva, or Brussels, the capital of Belgium. It is practically certain that the activities of the United Nations organization will be temporarily moved from the United States to Europe for two or three months. Only the location remains to be selected.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Passes Resolution on Southwest Africa; India's Efforts Finally Succeed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] After a day-long debate, the General Assembly, by a vote of 41 to 10, with 4 abstentions, condemned the Union of South Africa for its failure to place the mandated territory of Southwest Africa under the United Nations trusteeship system. Last year, the General Assembly recommended that South Africa hand over Southwest Africa to the United Nations for trusteeship, but South Africa refused to comply. During this General Assembly vote, the colonial powers were defeated by the Muslim, Slavic, and most Asian countries. India, which had opposed South Africa for a long time, finally achieved victory.</p>
<h3>Differences of Opinion Between the US and the Soviet Union on the Palestine Partition Plan; Difficult to Accept British Responsibility for Security Alone</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] London diplomatic observers believe that Britain will reject the U.S. proposal that British troops alone be responsible for security in Palestine before July 1948. However, a Foreign Office spokesman declined to say whether this decision had been notified to the United States.</p>
<p>Diplomatic observers further pointed out that this new U.S. proposal has created a divergence of opinion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which had previously been in agreement. The U.S. had previously advocated enforcing the partition plan with the help of international forces, but now it is advocating that Britain alone be responsible for security before the implementation of partition. Arab countries had previously pointed out that the Soviet Union's support for the international forces proposal was because it would allow Soviet troops to reach the Mediterranean coast. However, it is expected that the Soviet Union will not agree to the proposal that British troops alone remain in Palestine to be responsible for security during the transition period. As far as Britain is concerned, it is unwilling to clearly state its position until the entire United Nations General Assembly has expressed its opinion on the partition plan and its implementation methods. As for the nature of the U.S. proposal, it is unlikely that Britain will be willing to have 100,000 British troops continue to perform a meaningless task in the Holy Land for the next eight months in order to implement a partition plan that Foreign Minister Bevin is said not to trust.</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly Rejects Trusteeship for Non-Self-Governing Territories</h3>

China, India, the Muslim countries, and the Slavic countries all supported this recommendation, believing that it was the best way to promote self-government for the peoples of colonial territories. However, colonial powers such as the United States, Britain, and Belgium actively opposed it. The final vote was 24 votes for and 24 votes against, with one abstention, failing to reach the two-thirds majority required for the General Assembly to pass the recommendation.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Protest Rent Increase: Over a Hundred Arrested for Blocking Vehicles: Few Vehicles Seen Near Xiaodongmen and Chujiaqiao</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a disturbance involving rickshaw pullers suddenly occurred in the area from Xiaodongmen on South Minquan Road to Chujiaqiao on South Xizang Road. At that time, groups of rickshaw pullers who had stopped working blocked the passage of operating rickshaws, even forcibly pulling passengers off the vehicles and deflating the tires, forcing them to return the rickshaws to their owners, hoping to create a strike situation. The cause of this dispute was the recent increase in rickshaw rentals demanded by the owners. Double-seater rickshaws were raised from 50,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan per day, medium-sized rickshaws from 50,000 yuan to 58,000 yuan, and single-seater rickshaws from 40,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. At the same time, an additional deposit was required: 2,000,000 yuan for double-seater rickshaws and 1,800,000 yuan for single-seater rickshaws. The rickshaw pullers felt that this price increase was too exploitative and unbearable, so they unanimously opposed it. As a result, some rickshaw pullers spread out along the South Minquan Road to South Xizang Road area, and whenever they saw colleagues passing by, they forced them to stop working, leading to a serious dispute. All rickshaws in the surrounding area nearly disappeared. The various police precincts of Songshan, Yimiao, and Penglai ordered a large number of police officers to patrol and arrest people everywhere, and the General Bureau also dispatched motorcycle teams to the scene of the disturbance to assist in the arrests. The disturbance was thus prevented from escalating. It was learned later that from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM yesterday, the various precincts successively detained a total of over a hundred rickshaw pullers involved in the disturbance: over twenty from Penglai, twenty from Yimiao, over forty from Songshan, over ten from Changshu, over ten from Changning, nine from Xujiahui, and six from Lujiawan. After being brought to the police station for interrogation, they were sentenced to one to three days of detention for violating public order as a warning.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Strike Mainly Due to Welfare Fees</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] According to Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, this morning some rickshaw pullers in the Nanshi area went on strike and blocked others from working along the way. The Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving the report, found that the main reason for the strike was that the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society had been collecting 250 yuan per rickshaw rental as a welfare fund for the society (single-seater rickshaws converted from human-powered vehicles were also charged). The rickshaw owners collected the fees on behalf of the society and remitted them to the Municipal Bank every month, and the mutual aid society then withdrew and used the funds from the Municipal Bank. Recently, the method was changed to remit the fees every six months. The rickshaw owners had not remitted the welfare fees collected in July, August, September, and October to the Municipal Bank, and the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society had no funds to use as a result. Some rickshaw pullers expressed dissatisfaction with this and went on strike. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched Section Chief Huang Changhan of the Seventh Section and representatives from the labor union to persuade the workers to resume work, informing them that the Social Affairs Bureau had ordered the rickshaw owners' association to notify all rickshaw owners to remit the existing four months' worth of mutual aid society welfare fees to the Municipal Bank.</p>
<p>Director Shen continued to state that the rickshaw rental dispute has not yet been resolved. The rickshaw owners demand that the rent be calculated based on the cost of living index, but the rickshaw pullers, due to their limited income and difficult living conditions, are asking for a discount. To this end, the Social Affairs Bureau has suggested to the Municipal Government that rickshaw rentals should be determined by a review committee jointly organized by various agencies, but the Municipal Government has not yet approved this.</p>

Wang also stated that the disaster victims in the Northeast were very grateful for Madam Chiang Kai-shek's concern during his visit to represent her in disaster relief efforts. However, the disaster situation in the Northeast is still very serious and urgently needs relief. Wang also said that there are two major events in the Northeast: bandit suppression and relief.

At around 2:00 PM, Xu and Yan Ming, the chief reporter of the newspaper, went to the bureau as scheduled. After arriving at the bureau, it was said that Deputy Director Luo had gone out on official business, and Wu Juntu, the secretary, received them.

At the same time, the section chief Lan Wenbo, the personnel administrator Tong Xueyuan, and more than ten other people whose names are unknown, who had been lying in ambush outside the room, rushed in and beat Xu violently without asking for any reason. Yan tried his best to dissuade them, but to no avail. As a result, Xu suffered injuries to his head, neck, ribs, and abdomen. Then Secretary Wu ordered a laborer with a wooden gun and rope to tie up Xu. Wu and the other ten people escorted Xu to the Third District Commissioner's Office. Zhu Zhong, the Deputy Commander of the Commissioner's Office, said that the office had not been informed of the incident in advance, so he could not accept the case.

County Magistrate Xu immediately telegraphed the bureau, ordering them to release Xu immediately. Then Wu and the others escorted Xu to the county government. After Xu reported the details of the humiliation he had suffered, County Magistrate Xu agreed to release Xu first. By this time it was already 6:30 PM. After Xu regained his freedom, he immediately went to the Songjiang District Court Prosecutor's Office to report his injuries and file a complaint accusing them of assault and deprivation of freedom.

<h3>Interpretation of Whether Leased Housing Can Be Requested for Return After Expiration of the Term</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the promulgation and implementation of the revised Land Law, there is much doubt about whether the lessor of a leased house with a fixed term can request the return of the leased house after the expiration of the lease term. The Shanghai District Court submitted two points to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. It is learned that the Judicial Yuan has resolved the issue in a unified legal meeting and issued a notice to comply with it. The original text states: "Where a lease has a fixed term, Article 100 of the Land Law does not apply, as interpreted in the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 3489. Therefore, when the lease term expires, if there is no provision in Article 451 of the Civil Code, the lease relationship is terminated, and the lessor may request the lessee to return the leased property."</p>
<h3>Madman Wields Knife, Three People Bleed</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] In the Nanshi Taoshachang Guoyutang Street, at around 9:00 AM yesterday, a madman, about twenty years old, suddenly wielded a wood ax and slashed at people he encountered, causing three passersby to be injured because they could not avoid him. The young madman was then captured with a rope by Jin Abao, a rickshaw puller, and sent to the Yimiao Police Precinct. It is learned that the person who was more seriously injured was named Xu Guanjin, 17 years old, an apprentice at Zhu Fuxing Construction Factory at 831 Zhonghua Road. The other two women and children suffered minor injuries and were discharged from the hospital after receiving treatment.</p>
<h3>Striving Hard and Upholding Their Positions: Over Six Hundred Japanese Nationals Remaining in Shanghai: A Satire on Shanghai: Many Factories and Hospitals Rely on Their Planning</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Eight years of turmoil, two years of victory. The shadows of Japanese aggression still remain deeply and bleakly in everyone's mind. Now, the "heroes of the Empire" have certainly disappeared with the times. However, in front of our eyes, there is still a serious satire: There are still six hundred and sixty Japanese nationals remaining in Shanghai! The technical departments of many factories, hospitals... that have "suffered a lot" still rely on these thousand-plus hands to plan and operate!</p>
<p>These six hundred-plus Japanese nationals probably did not participate in the war, because according to them, those who had served in the "Holy War" a few years ago had long been uneasy and rushed to return home. They are technicians. Eating is their top priority. Since the Chinese government wanted to retain them, they were naturally happy to serve. And it is said that many had already packed their bags and boarded the ship, waiting to be repatriated, but as a result, we discovered that they were technical talents and were finally firmly retained. Our generosity and warmth did indeed deeply move them, and they expressed their gratitude in their work: upholding their positions, working diligently, obeying orders, and not shying away from hard work. It is said that they have also gained a little practical understanding in the past two years: in China, they only need to use 60% of their original ability and intelligence, because our industrial level is low, our equipment is simple, and the required progress is not too high.</p>
<h3>Understanding Chinese Industry</h3>
<p>The actual life experiences of working alongside us have led them to have many admirable questions about Chinese industry. A Japanese expatriate named Nakayama, a graduate of the Tongwen Academy, told reporters: China, so far, does not seem to have broken away from its agricultural-based production model. If we want to revitalize the countryside, we must first export in large quantities, using trade surpluses to exchange for the conditions for our own survival and development. He wondered why we do not first devote all our efforts to the large-scale production and processing of agricultural products and export them to countries in need. Talking about industry, he gave an example: Switzerland's natural conditions dictate that it can only produce "precision machinery," so the Swiss watch industry has occupied the world market under their country's "key production." Like China's current industrial situation, it cannot yet manufacture cars itself, mainly because it cannot manufacture car body parts. But China has coal and iron, and can refine steel, so why don't industrialists use these conditions to invest only in the research and manufacture of parts, which will be used to earn foreign exchange in the future, and then declare war on the world industrial market? He said that he has been in China for more than seventeen years, and recently participated in the actual work of a Chinese factory. From years of subtle observation, he discovered that China has many industries that have enough conditions to develop into an important part of world industry, but the results seem to be strangled by the short-sightedness of industrialists. He has a conclusion for Chinese industrialists: "Industries that produce for their own profits are not necessarily the industries that the country needs most. They probably haven't realized this yet!"</p>
<h3>Implementing Mutual Aid in a Planned Way</h3>
<p>The deep and persistent character of the Japanese people is well known to us, and it is more fully revealed in their "mutual aid society." Whether it is doing things, dealing with people, living, or even activities, there is order and planning. Although the monthly income of more than 600 Japanese expatriates varies due to the different positions in the retained organizations, everyone's living standards are surprisingly uniform. They eat coarse food, wear old clothes, and there is absolutely no exception. From their limited monthly salaries, everyone helps each other and automatically donates to the "mutual aid society" to run "remedial schools for children left behind," taking turns to serve as volunteer teachers. They set up "mailboxes" and take turns sending and receiving mail. They run "bags for aiding war criminals," providing clothes and food to compatriots. As for the cleanliness of the residence and the constraints of discipline, they have reached a level of self-confidence and shared trust.</p>
<p>The more than 600 Japanese expatriates now only have about 1,000 family members, and most of their families are said to still be in Japan, so they feel very inconvenienced by the restrictions on mailing packages. Therefore, they also hope that the peace treaty can be signed soon. According to them: After the treaty is concluded, there is no need to set up a consulate at all, and it is most appropriate for the Chinese police to manage it. Because as long as their families are reunited and the retained organizations do not dismiss them, they will still want to apply for citizenship! A Japanese expatriate who said this had a bitter smile on his face that was almost ingratiating.</p>
<h3>Three Hundred Have Chinese Wives</h3>
<p>Among the retained Japanese expatriates, 300 are married to Chinese wives. The children born to these separated couples are now studying in remedial schools for children left behind. It is said that their grades are higher than those of students in Japan. The only aspiration of these students in the future is to enter Chinese universities to continue their studies. When reporters visited this school, an old piano inside was playing Japanese songs, and two children with Chinese blood were staring blankly outside, listening attentively. The mood was melancholic and mournful. These innocent "second-generation Japanese," hopefully they will never follow in the footsteps of their parents.</p>
<p>Facing this group of hard-working and self-improving Japanese expatriates, we feel ironic, even though they are still immersed in the pain of failure, and others are still controlling their own destiny!</p>
<h3>Comforting National Troops and Aiding Refugees; Shandong Compatriots' Fundraising Conference; Stabilizing Society Based on the Principle of Self-Help and Helping Others</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Famous Shandong figures Qin Dechun, Shangguan Yunxiang, and others initiated the "Fundraising Conference to Comfort Troops Suppressing the Rebellion in Shandong and Aid Refugees in Recovered Areas." It was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road. More than 500 people attended, including heads of institutions, celebrities from all walks of life, and fellow Shandong natives. The presidium consisted of nine people: Qin Dechun, Shangguan Yunxiang, Li Jianai, Du Guangxun, Kong Lingcan, Zhang Liangchen, Wu Zuojun, Tang Xingwu, and Qu Wansen.</p>
<p>Displaced and in Dire Need of Relief</p>
<p>After the ceremonial proceedings, Chairman Qin Dechun delivered the opening speech, stating briefly: There are three meanings to convening this conference today: First, since the mobilization order was issued, the national troops in Shandong have been born into death and have been brave among the three armies. The bandits' lairs, such as Yimeng and Yantai, have been recovered one after another, and their achievements have been remarkable. We should express our utmost respect. Second, the communist bandits are cruel by nature, and there are countless victims. Now that the Qinglu Relief Agency has ended, relief work needs to be continued urgently. Third, there are not a few displaced young people in Shandong Province. If they are not rescued quickly, they may be coerced by the communist bandits to join them. Our strength is weak and our ability is shallow. We hope that people from all walks of life will provide strong assistance so that the suppression of the rebellion can go one step further and the great cause of national reconstruction will be realized.</p>
<p>Striving to Donate and Lay the Foundation for the Overall Situation</p>
<p>Next, Huang Bodu, Vice Minister of Social Affairs, delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Gu, saying: Suppressing the rebellion and rescuing the victims are the government's duties, but the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone. The people should also adhere to the principle of self-help and helping others and work together to complete the rescue work in order to stabilize society. Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner Nie Zhuang delivered a speech, saying: North China is the source of military power, and poverty is the source of chaos. Pacifying the communist banditry in North China will stabilize China, and rescuing the refugees in Shandong Province will quell the chaos. Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian said in his speech: Shanghai citizens live and work in peace and contentment, which is supreme happiness, but we cannot ignore our compatriots for the sake of our own safety. Shandong is located in a crucial position and has a huge impact on the Central Plains. We hope that Shanghai citizens will strive to donate and lay the foundation for the overall situation. Subsequently, Xu Hongya, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and Yang Bufei, Deputy Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, successively expressed their opinions and announced the completion of the ceremony. There were also many recreational activities after the meeting, which did not end until 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>A Large Group of Thugs Arrested on Liquan Road, Xiejiao</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] At about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, near Yongxintang on Liquan Road, Xiejiao, a large group of workers were seen holding iron rulers and wooden sticks, seemingly intending to start a fight. After receiving a report, the Songshan Police Branch urgently dispatched dozens of armed police officers to the scene and arrested 26 people, including Hou Xinggen, Wang Mingqian, and Xu Yufa, who were all taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to Hou Xinggen, who lives at No. 24 Sujiajiao, Changning Road, West Shanghai, he and his friend Wang Mingqian went to Liquan Road the night before to collect membership fees. In the darkness, a dog jumped out and bit his leg. After being injured, he picked up a stone and threw it, but missed and instead hit a rickshaw puller on the head, causing him to bleed profusely. Many of the rickshaw puller's companions came to argue with them, and they got into a fight and beat them up. This afternoon, they gathered 40 to 50 workers and went to the South City to seek revenge. Because they could not find the rickshaw puller who committed the crime, they searched the area and were arrested. The police bureau, finding that the truth was clear, sentenced them to seven days of detention as a warning.</p>

<h3>Vehicle Accidents Occur Frequently; A Cart Driver Dies from Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] At about 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, Zhou Lide, the owner of the cart rental business at No. 305 Yangzhou Road, East Shanghai, ordered cart drivers Zhang Jinsheng and Lu Shunxiang to load three barrels of war soy sauce on a cart, weighing about 1,200 pounds. They passed the Zhapu Road Bridge, heading north from the south. Zhang was pulling the cart in front, and when they reached the top of the bridge, they suddenly lost their center of gravity. The cart wheels slipped down, and Zhang was hit against a telephone pole on the east sidewalk, injuring his internal organs. The large intestine flowed out. He was sent to the Public Benevolence Hospital by the police in a car, but treatment was ineffective, and he died yesterday morning.</p>
<p>At about 9:30 AM yesterday morning, a military truck with the license plate number 4713948 was driving past No. 1326 North Sichuan Road, when a streetcar No. 158 came from the opposite direction. Unable to avoid it, the truck crashed into the streetcar head and destroyed it.</p>

<h3>Trip to Northern Jiangsu: On the Tongyu Road</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch, 1st] From Nantong in northern Jiangsu directly to Yu County, this Tongyu Highway, which is about 1,000 li long, is indeed as important militarily or economically as today's Jinpu, Qian, and Jiaoji lines. The section of the highway from Nantong via Rugao and Hai'an in Funing County to the county seat of Dongtai, which is about 240 li long, can be described as smooth. Merchant trucks transporting cotton, pigs, chickens, ducks, and chicken eggs run back and forth. Transportation is mainly for freight, supplemented by passenger transport. The fare from Tong to Dong is 93,000 yuan per person. There are no seats, so you have to squat on the cotton bales that are as tall as a zhang, or in the gaps between the chickens and pigs. If you are lucky, you can exchange for a seat next to the driver for an additional 50,000 yuan, comfortably admiring the scenery along the way.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Force: "Great"? Sees Bandits, Runs Away!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the self-defense force. On October 25, the reporter crossed the river from Zhenjiang, passed Liuyu Yangzhou, and first arrived in Taixian County. On the Wanfu Bridge on the Yangtai Highway, he first saw the wonderful performance of the Jiangdu Self-Defense Force members in the countryside. He saw the tense scene of holding guns and stopping cars. However, the leaders of the Jiangdu County Self-Defense Force were quite law-abiding and disciplined. Finally, they accepted the reporter's advice and stopped the mischief of the people's self-defense force, making all the poor people in the car shout "Good" in unison. At the same time, in the countryside of Dongtai, the self-defense spirit of the self-defense force recently came to two wonderful performances. The time was midnight on October 20, and the location was Liang Duo, 18 li away from the east gate of Dongtai.</p>
<p>It is said that three days before October 20, the sentinel team of Liang Duo Valley Township had joined dozens of guns to eliminate bandits in Liangdong Township. Because the self-defense force failed to provide timely reinforcements, they suffered a big loss. Two township chiefs and more than ten young sentinel team members were killed by the bandits. This exposed the incompetence and selfishness of the Liang Duo Self-Defense Force and sentinel team. Therefore, the remaining bandits in Liangdong Township launched a surprise attack on Liang Duo itself on the night of the 20th. War is based on deception, and bandits are even more deceptive. At that time, there were two or three hundred bandits (including civilians with bare hands). The sound of the bugle blowing from all directions seemed to be from seven or eight branches. Probably, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and to achieve the real "self-defense" mission in the future, the people's self-defense force quietly ran away in groups to a safe shelter. In this way, the bandits entered a no-man's land, opened the doors of shops on the street, robbed more than 20 loads of cloth and other materials, and kidnapped some civilians. Before leaving, they also destroyed a wooden bridge on the Tongyu Road. It was not until October 29 that it was repaired and traffic was restored. Afterwards, the people were pained and thoughtful, and had no small complaints about the people's self-defense force that did not fire a single shot. The military and the government, as well as local people in the county seat, had different views and opinions on such a bad self-defense force, but the fact was so, and they had to sigh in unison. It is said that most of the leaders of the Dongtai Self-Defense Force are sent from above. It is difficult to serve these people, and the people, guns, and funds must all be taken from the people. It is difficult to coordinate personnel, and command and management are also difficult. If it is not improved quickly, then the county magistrate who abides by the pacification rules will have to suffer for others again.</p>
<h3>Hope is Placed on Military Affairs; Expectation of a Peaceful Life</h3>
<p>After the Liang Duo bandit police incident and the murder of passengers on the Taidong shipping line's 18-mile river mouth, the safety issues on both land and water added another layer of shadow to the heavy hearts of Dongtai merchants and residents. At this time, everyone's hope was placed on military affairs. On October 29, the news of the recovery of Zhoujia Duo spread, and people's hearts were slightly stabilized. Now, the suppression work in Dongtai is being actively carried out. All the merchants and residents in the city are enduring the nearly 20 million yuan of supply fees every day (the price difference for purchasing forage, pork, etc. for the army) to look forward to a peaceful life. Because everything must be done with military affairs first, this desolate and isolated city seems tense and enthusiastic. The most sensitive thing is the price. The prices in the three counties of Jiangbei, Taidong, and Xing are already catching up with those in Jiangnan because of low production, high consumption, expensive freight, and heavy miscellaneous fees. The price of rice in Dongtai hovers around 600,000 yuan, pork is 20,000 yuan per catty, burning grass is 70,000 yuan per 100 catties, and the price of coarse velvet cotton is also very chaotic. The price of seed cotton is about 1.2 million yuan per 100 catties. What farmers fear most is the scary hats and rackets. The reporter saw along the way from Dongtai to Nantong that on the highway, there were various people collecting, inspecting, and checking, all of whom could extort money from others. Almost everyone had a pair of dirty hands and a ferocious face. The most pitiful were the police. They actually collected 10,000 yuan of small vegetable money from the car merchants and cargo owners in a grand manner, and they had to wink and strike a deal.</p>
<h3>Yu Zisan's Suicide Was Caused by Negligence in Prevention; The Three Guards Will Be Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, 2nd] The Zhejiang Security Command issued a strict notice yesterday prohibiting illegal actions, stating that if anyone disregards the overall interests of the country and the nation, they will be dealt with according to legal procedures. However, in order to protect young people and respect the opinions of the school, the authorities transferred the case to the court before the investigation was completed. As for Yu Zisan's suicide, it was caused by negligence in prevention. The Public Security Bureau has placed the three guards, Wang, Jiang, and Hua, under house arrest and will be punished according to law. It also stated that those who are instigated to threaten others by strikes, slowdowns, or market strikes will be prosecuted for obstructing property, society, and security. All labor-capital issues should be resolved through legal procedures and should not be resolved through strikes, slowdowns, or market strikes. Otherwise, they will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<h3>"Whose Chickens are These? Hurry, Hurry, Bring the Money Here!"</h3>
<p>The most popular, most profitable, most comfortable, and smartest money takers on the Tongyu Highway are none other than the tax collectors. Most of them sit in the house and do not show their faces. A few uniformed patrolmen raise red flags to stop military trucks. As long as the car merchants and cargo owners know how to behave, they will not bother to come out to inspect. The car the reporter was in had pigs, , and cotton, but because there was little cotton, the target was small, and there was less trouble. If it is a military truckload of cotton, that would be enough to make you suffer. However, even though chickens are small, there are already small tricks appearing. When this merchant military truck was parked in front of a small tax gate on the border of Dongtai, unexpectedly someone came to check the chickens. A patrolman with a mixed accent walked up to the truck in a very imposing manner and wanted to count the chickens, shouting while counting: "Whose chickens are these? Hurry, hurry," he did not shout the sentence "Bring the money here," but someone had already stuffed a roll of legal tender into his two-and-a-half-foot-long pocket. And then, the car drove off.

Each county is allowed to set up up to nine squadrons to cooperate with the local people's self-defense teams to prevent bandits from invading.</p>
<h3>Two County Magistrates in Anhui Province Died Resisting Bandits</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Bengbu dispatch, October 7th] When Liu Bocheng's communist bandit forces captured Lihuang in western Anhui, County Magistrate Li Xuan led his troops to resist, resulting in his capture. During the interrogation, he did not say a word and stood upright, and was immediately killed. When Chen Yi's forces captured Taihe in northern Anhui at the beginning of the month, County Magistrate Qiu Tianmin was ordered to lead his troops to retreat, but was overtaken by the bandit forces. He still directed the resistance. Due to the disparity in numbers, he was captured alive by the bandits and shot to death, and his body was exposed for a long time. The Anhui Provincial Government believes that the two county magistrates, Li and Qiu, died resisting bandits, and their loyalty and bravery are commendable. In addition to deciding to provide generous compensation to their families, they will also request commendation in order to encourage and motivate others.</p>

News has come that Wang Jinbao, the Xibao chief of Daludu Village, Meicun Town, Dongting District, was personally led by Chen Xueliang, the bandit leader of eastern Wuxi (i.e., Zhao Jianping, the communist bandit county magistrate of eastern Wuxi), at about 1:00 AM on the 30th. More than a dozen bandits broke open the back door, dragged him outside, and fired five shots in a row, killing him on the spot. The situation was very tragic. The next day, the widow of the deceased and his younger brother Jin Gui reported the information to the Dongheng Police Branch and the Dongheng Suppression Command, requesting arrest. According to the family of the deceased, the bandits who attacked that day were all acquaintances, namely Chen Xueliang, Fang Juexing, Fang Xiaoniu, and Chen Xichang.</p>

Furthermore: The County Government, considering that winter is approaching and in order to cooperate with the mobilization and suppression of the rebellion program, ensure security, and provide relief to unemployed youth and refugees from northern Jiangsu, has initiated a winter relief campaign. It is currently raising funds to prepare for the distribution of congee and clothing, as well as small loans.</p>

<p>[Our Hengyang Dispatch of the 2nd] Zhu Yongyi, a mechanical engineer on the Yuehan Railway, has invented a new character indexing method. It compares the tones of Chinese characters to the letters of Western languages and the order of Chinese strokes to the order of Western strokes, adjusting, simplifying, and arranging them accordingly.

<h3>Yellow River Ferry Crossings to be Opened</h3>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch of October 28th] All ferry crossings north of Kaifeng on the Yellow River have been closed for the past two months due to the unpredictable movements of the communist bandits on the north bank. Recently, because the remnants of bandits along the riverbank in northern Henan have been suppressed, the ferry crossings are about to be opened simultaneously. Northern Henan has a large grain reserve, and after the ferry crossings are opened, a large batch of food will flow south to Kaifeng. It is generally expected that the city's grain prices will soon drop significantly.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Cinema Employees Go on Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch of the 2nd] All employees of Suzhou's cinemas went on strike today. The reason is that they are demanding that the management follow the cost of living index, leading to a deadlock between the two sides that cannot be resolved. Today happens to be Sunday, and there is a large crowd of moviegoers, all in a state of frustration. Currently, the City Defense Department's General Labor Union and the county government have begun mediation.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Veterans Demolish the Suzhou Station Master's Office</h3>

<h3>Nine Merchants Tragically Strangled; Families Still Dare Not Report It</h3>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch of October 28th] I recently learned from merchants coming from the south about a shocking case of robbery and murder of nine people. The incident occurred late on the night of August 14th, but it has not been publicly revealed to this day. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Guo Yu'en, Guo Wenhui, Guo Shilin, Guo Maolin, Wang Laosi, and others from Xin Yang Township in the Second District of this county, as well as Li Hongkai, Li Jianlian, Guo Dabao, and Li Dunxiang from Xin Dian Township in the Seventh District of Rugao, collectively raised 60 million yuan to transport salt. On August 12th, they departed from Xin Yang Township. While passing near the Sanyou River in Dongmatang Town, Rugao County, they were suddenly attacked by bandits. All the funds were robbed, and the nine merchants were strangled and buried in ancient tombs outside the sentry post in Matang Town in an attempt to conceal the bodies and eliminate the evidence. The families of the Guos and others secretly went to the site of the incident at night and discovered that the nine victims were all placed in one pit. Their heads and bodies all had wounds from knives, a bloody and horrifying sight. The families of the Guos and others have already transported the bodies back for funeral and burial. However, the families of the deceased are still afraid of the bandits' power and fear further accidents, so they have not reported the incident to the authorities.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Fish Market Established</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch of October 28th] The Qingdao Fish Market, after several months of preparation, is now ready. The inaugural meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 27th of this month in the meeting hall of the Municipal Council, and Diao Fengting and others were elected as supervisors. Secretary Zhu, a representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Municipal Government Secretary-General Jiang Kexun, and over a hundred shareholders attended.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of an Agricultural Family</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 2) In a previous dispatch, I mentioned this case, which later sparked many interesting debates at the foreign journalist reception of the International Propaganda Office. If I were the head of the Harrison delegation at that time, I would have felt exactly the same way. I know that after this incident, the Warsaw Municipal Government issued a new order that every Monday and Tuesday, all restaurants were banned from serving meat. A waiter at a large restaurant told me: "That's nonsense. Poland may not have much to be proud of, but it doesn't lack meat. Poland has plenty of pork, beef, and lamb. Why prohibit customers from eating meat?"</p>
<p>These situations are also quite endearing. Overseas Chinese friends in Warsaw, as well as those who came to see me from other small towns, gave me a lot of salted meat, sausages, ham, and large chunks of lard. They said: "Germany has everything, but lacks food. Poland doesn't have much else, but it has plenty of food." I appreciate their kindness, especially their simple and clear understanding of economics.</p>
<p>The economic construction of the Polish Communist Party is commendable. They are constantly launching so-called "winter plowing campaigns" and "spring plowing campaigns." Secretary Bian, who recently took office at the Polish Embassy, traveled to Warsaw by train and did not see a single acre of wasteland along the way. This is an interesting contrast to France's "everywhere is desolate." He said: Polish farmers are very simple and honest. Along the way, he saw many Polish farmers living in thatched-roof houses, with flies swarming in the summer. These characteristics unique to agricultural societies cannot be found within the territories of Germany and France.</p>
<p>After liberation, Poland's currency underwent a small adjustment. The currency unit is still called "Zloty." One US dollar is officially worth one hundred "Zloty," but because of foreign exchange imbalances, the black market price of a US dollar is 800 or 900. It is said that two or three months ago, it was sold for more than 1,000. In the red world behind the Iron Curtain, Warsaw's commercial freedom surprises me. The display windows of department stores on the main streets have everything, and the prices are all in the thousands and tens of thousands. People with money can enjoy whatever they want, but most Poles, or salaried workers, can only sigh while looking at the display windows!</p>
<p>Warsaw does not have a "rationing" system like Berlin because the housing problem is controlled by the police station. Warsaw, which had a pre-war population of two million, now has only 300,000 people left, but it is still not enough (because everything was destroyed). The police station stipulates that two people share a room. Small families who want to find ideal "suites" with bathrooms and kitchens, like in Shanghai, have to pay a "key fee," which in Europe is called "key money." Many tenants in Warsaw calculate the key money in US dollars.</p>
<p>Within the small circle of government civil servants, they also have their rationing system. In Warsaw, civil servants have housing, shoes, clothing materials, and food rations. I asked a municipal government official, and he said, "We receive very little salary, but there are no problems with our lives!"</p>
<p>After the Communist Party took over state-owned factories, the lives of workers were exactly the same as those of civil servants. The Polish authorities are now working hard to promote the industrialization movement. Especially after acquiring the eastern territories of Germany, "Silesia produces 3.1 million tons of bituminous coal and 1.7 million tons of peat annually, making Poland the fourth-largest coal-producing country in Europe." During the last Moscow conference, when the three powers discussed the issue of German reparations and reconstruction, Secretary of State Marshall said: "Germany has lost the coal resources of Silesia. How can Germany be expected to produce?" Therefore, Marshall believed that Poland should return half of the "recovered territories," which shocked the entire Polish government and public. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs hastily compiled many historical and geographical proofs, demonstrating from a theoretical standpoint, historical origins, geographical background, and even the distribution of land and population that it should be Polish territory. On the one hand, they are creating a fait accompli in fact, stepping up the expulsion of Germans and resettling Poles, to avoid a "reversal of the case" in future peace treaties with Germany.</p>
<p>The International Propaganda Office in Warsaw sent me many pamphlets and welcomed foreign journalists to visit their "recovered territories" and see the new policies. The current governor of the recovered territories is Communist Party Secretary Gomulka, Poland's Little Stalin.</p>
<p>The "recovered territories" also include most of East Prussia. Poland's biggest concern was the lack of a coastline. The only seaport, "Danzig," was always used by Hitler as an excuse for conspiracies. Now, all of Danzig has been incorporated into Polish territory. The original 140 kilometers of coastline have now increased to 550 kilometers. The Polish government has specifically designated a day called the</p>
<p>"Coastal Festival." At this year's Coastal Festival, President Bierut went to the seaside to inspect the Polish Navy.</p>
<p>It is not easy for agricultural families to engage in industrial and commercial construction. With a coastline, ships are even more necessary. Poland has a state-owned shipping company that bought three merchant ships from the United States last year, and they are now sailing in the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

<h3>If Bandit Incidents Are Not Solved, Neighboring Hundred Households Will Be Responsible for Compensation; Changshu County Government Meeting Resolves to Pass It</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch of the 1st] The county government held its tenth county government meeting to review its work. County Magistrate Zhang proposed on the spot that during the winter defense period, if bandit robbery cases occur within the territory and cannot be solved within a month as stipulated, the Bao Jia chief and the neighboring hundred households in the locality will jointly bear the responsibility for compensation. Immediately, District Chief Ding of Shazhou District offered opinions on legal issues, such as what to do if the Bao Jia chief does not pay compensation, factual issues, or what to do if the amount robbed is so large that they cannot afford the compensation, and concerns that the Township Bao Jia chief may passively resist. After careful discussion, the final resolution was made: The principle must be implemented, and the detailed measures will be drafted by the first and fifth departments of the county government and submitted to the Second District Bandit Suppression Conference for decision, and then implemented in each district. Also: The winter defense work here was implemented on the 1st. All ports along the river, except for Hupu and Fushan, are closed. Vessels entering and exiting will be subject to stricter inspections.

<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch of October 25th] Chen Jingzhai, the puppet chairman of Henan Province, left behind reversionary property in Mulin Road, Minggong Road, Liu Wanshun Street, and other places. The Henan District Enemy and Puppet Property Special Commissioner's Office of the Executive Yuan investigated and verified this and obtained a guarantee from the local Bao Tian chief. Now, the county government and local gentry argue that the property is local public property, not reversionary property, and have presented land registry charts showing that there is no property in the name of Chen, as evidence, causing a dispute with the office. At the same time, the previously guaranteeing Bao Jia chief also published a statement denying the matter, causing an incident that could not be resolved. Both sides have telegraphed the Executive Yuan for instructions on how to handle the matter, and a result is expected soon.</p>

<h3>End of the Controversy Over National Painting in Beiping; The Issue of Reinstating Dismissed Teachers Is Still Difficult to Resolve</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Dental College Anniversary: Grand Celebration Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Shanghai Dental College and its affiliated hospital, which have just celebrated their first anniversary of establishment and the first anniversary of the opening of their clinic, held a grand celebration in the auditorium of the college at No. 40 Fuxing West Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 150 guests from all walks of life, including Ding Wen-yuan, Chen Yi-de, Huang Ji-ping, and teachers and students of the school, attended the event. Dan Yin-sun, a councilor sent by the Ministry of Education, participated as a representative. The celebration was presided over by Principal Situ Bo, who expressed his deep gratitude to all sectors for their assistance in the development of the school over the past year. He stated that dental medicine in Europe and the United States has made rapid progress, while China is still in its infancy. Dentistry in the United States is particularly advanced, with more than 80,000 dentists today. Due to the needs of post-war reconstruction, dentistry students accounted for the largest number of those applying to colleges and universities last year. All dental colleges plan to be renamed dental universities, with the goal of completing a plan for 110,000 dentists by 1950. In Taiwan, due to years of misleading by the Japanese, there are currently 700 dentists among the six million people. In contrast, the total number of dentists in mainland China is only over 350, which is far too few. According to statistics, dental diseases account for one-third of all diseases in China, and the health of teeth is related to the overall strength of the body, which shows its importance. Principal Situ then spoke about the faculty, equipment, and school building problems since the establishment of the school a year ago, and announced his five-year plan: The first year will be spent handling the registration procedures; the second year, planning a second campus on Chongqing South Road; the third year, planning the construction of a permanent campus in Jiangwan (the school site has been purchased and is located near Fudan University and the former site of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School); the fourth year, starting the construction of the permanent campus in Jiangwan; and the fifth year, moving into the Jiangwan campus. He finally emphasized that before the school gains social trust, it will never solicit donations from the outside world and will devote all its efforts to serving society and developing the urgently needed dental medical education. Councilor Dan Yin-sun from the Ministry of Education, Li Xi-mou, Acting Director of the Education Bureau, and Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, delivered speeches. Guests Ning Yi-heng and others gave speeches, and school directors Wang Wan-bai, Cao Shou-qian, and Yan Du-yi also delivered speeches of encouragement. The celebration concluded at 1:00 PM. In the afternoon, a lunch was held for teachers and students, which was a grand occasion. Starting today, 1,000 free treatment coupons will be printed and distributed to servants and the poor as a commemoration, which can be requested by the masters of servants or obtained by the poor in person at the school to seek treatment for dental diseases.</p>

<h3>Guang Gang Rushes to Purchase Tung Oil for Smuggling Due to Hong Kong Black Market Exchange Rates. Leader in Tung Oil Export Industry Discusses Current Export Situation. Total Exports from Shanghai and Hong Kong This Year Are Approximately 50,000 Tons.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] According to a leader in the tung oil export industry, total tung oil exports from Shanghai and Hong Kong this year, up to now, are approximately 50,000 tons. Of these, the United States accounts for approximately 60%, the United Kingdom accounts for 15%, and various parts of Europe, the Soviet Union, and Japan account for approximately 25%. Regarding overseas prices, in the United States, the market price is approximately 25 cents per pound, and the government stipulates that domestically produced goods are 27 cents per pound, with the difference being subsidized by the government, so the market price is relatively stable. Recently, due to some Hong Kong merchants selling short and failing to deliver futures contracts in October and November, totaling approximately 12,000 tons, they have been rushing to replenish their supplies in Shanghai, causing the market price to fluctuate slightly. In the United Kingdom, the current price is 205 pounds per ton, which means that goods exported from Hong Kong can still be profitable. However, after the British government lifted restrictions on tung oil, there are still 4,000 tons on hand. The country's supply office also stipulates that if merchants purchase tung oil from abroad, they must also purchase the same amount of the aforementioned inventory from their government at the above price. In other words, merchants operating in tung oil are using the average price of tung oil purchased from our country and their government as the standard. Other parts of Europe lack US dollars, so import controls are as strict as in our country.</p>
<p>The ratio of US dollars to British pounds in our country is 3 to 1, while the psychology of the people in Europe is more reasonable at a ratio of 4 to 1. As such, they lack US dollars and are unwilling to purchase goods from our country at the current exchange rate, coupled with the difficulty in obtaining import permits, so transactions are sluggish. The people in that region's view on the tung oil export of our country, says that following the announcement of the new exchange rate management method on August 16th, tung oil trade was able to develop; in particular, the reasonable adjustment of the exchange rate for the US dollar in the initial stage of the Stabilization Fund was able to promote tung oil exports; however, in recent months, the exchange rate has remained stable, resulting in the Shanghai tung oil price being approximately 20% higher than that of foreign countries, thus reducing exports. The domestic price is highest in Changsha, at 1.48 million yuan per tan. If it is transported to Shanghai, plus freight, its total value is approximately 10% higher than in Shanghai. The reason for this is that the black market exchange rate in Hong Kong is as much as 85% higher than the domestic official rate, thus creating smuggling by Guang Gang. Merchants are rushing to purchase goods at high prices in that area. Although customs in South China have strengthened their enforcement, the wind of smuggling is still fierce due to the wide disparity between the US dollar black market and the official rate, which is a threat to normal merchants. At the same time, according to past experience, an increase in sales in Hong Kong can affect the US market. Our country's authorities should pay attention to this. Last week, in addition to promoting exports, tung oil merchants were convened for discussions and raised discussions on this issue. Although a few merchants, in order to open up this difficulty and seek immediate benefits, intended for the government to restore the purchase policy, it is expected that the government will find it difficult to do so. This is because the opinions of most merchants and the public opinion abroad do not approve of our country's purchase policy, especially the United States, which strongly advocates free private operation in order to develop international trade. The person also said that the new oil in our country will gradually be launched in December. Although there are no accurate surveys of the total output in the past, according to the Gu Di report this year, except for slightly poor harvests in eastern Hubei, other places are good, and a total of 70,000 tons can be obtained. In addition to supplying domestic sales, the export part can reach 60,000 tons. As for how to maintain this export figure, we must first pay attention to the production cost and legal profit, which depends on the government's protection, or emulate the American method to guarantee a certain price and provide subsidies when the price falls, and then such as stipulating that each tan of tung oil is equal to a certain amount of white rice, and its price rises and falls with the price of rice, in order to encourage farmers to produce.</p>
<h3>Textile and Garment Adjustment Committee Denies Cancellation of Quotas for Southward Transport of Cotton Yarn and Cloth.</h3>
<p>The Textile and Garment Adjustment Committee specifically denied the rumor that quotas for the southward transport of cotton yarn and cloth would be cancelled starting this month. It stated that this quota was cancelled last month, but because the situation in South China is special, the southward transport quota must continue to be maintained. The committee did not make any decision to cancel the quota.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Spinning Machines Shipped to Siam</h3>
<p>The Fugyuan Textile Mill in Bangkok recently shipped four domestically produced Xin Nong-style spinning machines, totaling more than 500 spindles, from the Shanghai Xinyou Iron Factory. Zhang Guojun, a technician, has completed the installation, and it can produce 512 pounds of 20-count yarn per day. It is truly exciting news that our country has exported domestically produced spinning machines.</p>
<h3>Imported Raw Materials for Cigarettes Require Approximately 20 Million US Dollars Every Three Months.</h3>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs previously notified the factory industry association to make a report in order to understand the quantity of imported raw materials needed by various cigarette factories in the city in manufacturing and the foreign exchange required, so as to coordinate the distribution methods. It is reported that the three types of cigarette raw materials supplied by foreign countries are tobacco leaves, steel essence, and paper circles. According to the investigation, the total value of the three types needed every three months is: tobacco leaves 19,200,000, steel essence 1,350,000, paper circles 960,000, totaling 21,510,000 US dollars.</p>
<h3>National Cigarette Industry Federation Handles Raw Material Registration.</h3>
<p>The National Cigarette Industry Federation convened a board meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the self-provided foreign exchange for the import of cigarette industry production raw materials. It was decided to quickly urge the industry to register, and once completed, they will petition the government and the Export Control Committee, hoping that the original price will be allocated to the industry to facilitate production. They also hope that the authorities will understand the difficulties of the business community, simplify the technology as much as possible, and promptly announce the handling methods to dispel public doubts.</p>
<h3>Several Banks and Businesses Found with Insufficient Deposits Amidst National Bank's Thorough Investigation of Returned Checks.</h3>
<p>The number of returned checks in the city has been increasing recently, and the National Bank has mobilized for a thorough investigation.

<h3>Cotton from India for Yarn and Cloth Exchange. The First Batch May Arrive at the End of the Month. The Export Sales Committee Will Handle Application and Import Procedures.</h3>
<p>The exchange of cotton yarn and cloth with cotton from India is expected to be signed in mid-month. In the first contract, state-owned and private textile factories can apply for one-tenth of their six-month output at a time to exchange for flowers from India. The exchange ratio of cotton yarn was previously set by the Export Sales Committee as one package of 20-count yarn in exchange for 1,050 to 1,120 pounds of cotton. As for the exchange ratio of cloth, it has recently been stipulated that 24 pieces of fine cloth weighing 12 pounds will be exchanged for 1,150 pounds of cotton. After the spinning mills have been approved, all kinds of permit procedures such as applying for import and export will be handled by the Export Sales Committee to apply to the Export and Import Management Committee and the Central Bank. The Export Sales Committee has also agreed with the Indian authorities on the delivery dates for both parties, and the principle is that Indian cotton will be transported to Shanghai first. It is expected that after the contract is signed, the first batch of Indian cotton will arrive in the city at the end of this month.</p>

<h3>The "Reserve Requirement" Policy Must Be Implemented to Stop Malignant Inflation</h3>
<p>— Lin Lin</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) The author of this article has studied in the United States for many years, specializing in banking and monetary economics. He has written extensively, and his specialized works can be found in well-known American publications such as the American Economic Review, the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, and Free World.</p>
<p>Our country is currently facing a formidable enemy that is intensifying its attacks on us. Its advance is gradual but relentless, permeating every aspect of our lives. Whether people are in cities or villages, at home or abroad, they are inevitably affected. Moreover, its aggression is increasing day by day and becoming more intense over time. If we fail to stop it in time, this formidable enemy may destroy our country imperceptibly! What is this enemy? It is the "runaway inflation" formed by the vicious cycle of issuance inflation, price inflation, and fiscal deficit inflation. This runaway inflation takes the following form: Because prices are soaring, the national fiscal deficit increases; Because the national fiscal deficit increases, the issuance of banknotes increases; Because the issuance of banknotes increases, prices rise even higher; Because prices rise even higher, the national fiscal deficit doubles; Because the national fiscal deficit doubles, the issuance of banknotes doubles; Because the issuance of banknotes doubles, prices rise even higher.</p>
<p>We know that although the government has repeatedly adopted various price control measures, they have never achieved the desired results. Although the government has repeatedly declared its determination to balance revenues and expenditures, the fiscal deficit continues to increase unabated. As for controlling the issuance of banknotes, there has never been an effective plan. As a result, since 1940, runaway inflation has not only failed to ease but has accelerated. Frankly speaking, it has reached a point of no return. Therefore, many pessimistic observers, both Chinese and foreign, believe that our country's finances are on the verge of bankruptcy and the economy is about to collapse.</p>
<p>However, in the author's humble opinion, it is not too late to find a way to salvage the situation immediately. As long as we have the determination and can muster a spirit of fearless revolution, we can immediately stop the offensive of this formidable enemy of runaway inflation and avert the crisis. First, we must understand the main cause of "runaway inflation." Everyone knows that China today has the following undesirable phenomena: Shortage of goods supply; Lack of transportation; Increased production costs; Manipulation and speculation by unscrupulous merchants; Increased market demand; Increased currency circulation.</p>
<p>True, the above six phenomena, individually or collectively, can all cause or contribute to price increases, but they are not the main cause of "runaway inflation." They can only be considered secondary causes because current prices are continuing to rise sharply and are accelerating in geometric progression, not increasing gradually in arithmetic progression.</p>
<p>Take the increase in currency circulation, for example. According to one author's estimate, the amount of currency issued in China today has only increased five thousand times compared to before the war, but prices have soared thirty-five thousand times. Regardless of whether the quantitative theory of money is correct or not, we can at least say that the relationship between the current price inflation and the increase in the quantity of money has become disconnected.</p>
<p>What is the main cause of "runaway inflation"? Frankly speaking, it is the people's loss of faith in the legal tender.</p>
<p>The national legal tender system was originally the most modern system. Since its implementation in 1935, it has achieved remarkable results, especially for war financing. In the first three years of the war, the national price level was exceptionally stable, and there was no malignant inflation. Although military expenditures were enormous, the fiscal deficit did not increase excessively. This is due to the legal tender, which cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in 1940, like a thunderbolt, China's only international transportation lifeline at the time, the Burma Road, was suddenly cut off. This shocked the whole country, and prices soared, invisibly inflicting a fatal wound on China's legal tender. From the three months after the closure of the Burma Road, the value of the legal tender plummeted, leading to the current trend of irreversible decline. This can be said to be the starting point of "runaway inflation," which is the beginning of the people's loss of confidence in the legal tender.</p>
<p>Since then, on the one hand, the national price soared, and war expenses suddenly increased, so expenditures continued to increase; on the other hand, the occupied areas gradually expanded, and the efficiency of tax administration decreased, so revenues also decreased day by day. Thus, expenditures exceeded revenues, and the fiscal deficit became increasingly large. In order to implement the decision to resist Japan to the end and strive for final victory, the government had to grit its teeth and resort to desperate measures, increasing issuance to cope with the situation. The above three vicious cycles of inflation were thus formed.</p>
<p>The government and the people originally hoped that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the fiscal deficit could be reduced, the issuance could be reduced, prices could fall, and the inflation trend would not expand. Who knew that before the surrender procedures of Japan had been completed, the communists seized the opportunity to launch a destructive war. The central authorities, pained by the people's desire for peace and the need for recuperation, had no choice but to compromise and make concessions for peace. The communist side, taking an inch and wanting a mile, used the ceasefire time to actively expand its territory, from northern Shaanxi to northern Jiangsu, from northern China to northeastern China, with a sweeping momentum. Thus, the civil war expanded, and the vicious cycle continued. Its harm became increasingly fierce. The people's trust in the legal tender only decreased, and did not increase. In addition, the erroneous sale of gold exacerbated the situation, causing the legal tender to depreciate sharply and continuously to this day, causing endless harm.</p>
<p>Once the people lose confidence in the legal tender, any price control measures will lose their effectiveness, let alone that China has a vast territory and a large population, and lacks modern control conditions. Therefore, prices continue to fluctuate, and everyone still expects them to rise every day!</p>
<p>Once the people lose confidence in the legal tender, any exchange rate will not be maintained. Since March of last year, in less than two years, the exchange rate of the US dollar has been raised four times: last March, the exchange rate of the US dollar was raised from 500 yuan to 2,020 yuan. In less than half a year, it could not be maintained, so it had to be raised again to 3,350 yuan in mid-August. However, in less than half a year, it could not be maintained again. In mid-February of this year, an emergency measure was taken to raise the US dollar to 12,000 yuan. In other words, it increased three and a half times in six months. Even so, it still could not be maintained. By mid-August of this year, it had to be adjusted again. This time, while maintaining the original official price of 12,000 yuan, a new exchange rate called the "benchmark exchange rate" was set, with an initial rate of 40,000 yuan, which invisibly raised the US dollar by three and a third times.</p>
<p>Once the people lose confidence in the legal tender, any government budget cannot be balanced. There are many reasons for the imbalance of national revenue and expenditure, which we cannot discuss in detail here. What we want to point out in particular is that during the "suppression of the rebellion" military period, it is an inevitable phenomenon that expenditures exceed revenues, but today's imbalance is incomparable to the imbalance of the past. In the past, the difference in imbalance was limited, at most only a few percent or tens of percent. Today's imbalance often differs by more than two hundred or three hundred percent. (Needless to say, the most important reason for the difference between now and then is not the increase in military expenditures, but the accelerated rise in prices.)</p>
<p>Not only that, but ordinary people dare not and are unwilling to save because they have no confidence in the legal tender. As for the wealthy, they either engage in speculative business or try to escape with their funds abroad, and naturally there is no talk of raising funds for production. Furthermore, foreign capital is hesitant to advance, and even overseas remittances cannot be absorbed. Foreign goods flood the market as before, and export trade is increasingly exhausted. Therefore, the phenomenon of international balance of payments imbalance is becoming increasingly profound and acute!</p>
<p>To stop inflation, we must first restore the people's faith in the legal tender. To restore the people's faith in the legal tender, we must implement the "reserve requirement" policy. The maintenance of the value of modern currency does not rely on "convertibility," but it cannot be without "reserves." Currency is a kind of credit. In the minds of the general public, the only reliable guarantee for currency credit is ultimately "cash reserves." For example, the US dollar has been a non-convertible currency since 1933; but the value of the US dollar is more stable than any other country's currency; the biggest reason for this is that half of it is due to effective regulation, and half is due to sufficient "reserves." Everyone knows that the US dollar has the world's largest gold reserves behind it. If we have "cash" as the backing for the legal tender, who would still be willing to undermine it?</p>
<p>The "reserve requirement" policy, simply put, is a policy of vigorously collecting cash and silver as a fixed reserve for the legal tender. In other words, the government must immediately make a major determination at this time and adopt various effective methods to purchase and store large amounts of gold and silver, and publicly seal this gold and silver as a fixed reserve for the legal tender. This cash reserve is not working capital, nor is it a foreign exchange fund. It is part of the fixed capital of the issuing bank and is the guarantee behind the legal tender. It is absolutely not allowed to be used unless the issuing bank goes out of business. At the same time, the actual amount purchased and sealed each month must be publicly inspected and announced nationwide.</p>
<p>There are several specific ways to purchase and store cash reserves:</p>
<p>Issue long-term (35 to 50 years) Class A "Gold Reserve Public Bonds" in taels, with preferential interest rates, to exchange for gold currently existing in the country. This type of bond should be sold exclusively to people or legal entities holding gold bars, and those who previously purchased government gold should be ordered to purchase as much as possible. The gold obtained should be sealed monthly. Issue long-term (25 to 50 years) Class B "Gold Reserve Public Bonds" in US dollars, with preferential interest rates, to exchange for foreign exchange. This type of bond should be sold exclusively to people holding foreign currency securities or deposits and overseas Chinese. The foreign exchange obtained should not be used for other purposes, but only for purchasing cash and silver abroad. The gold and silver obtained should be sealed monthly. Sell domestic surplus materials, and use the proceeds to exchange for cash and silver at home and abroad. The gold and silver obtained should be sealed monthly. Actively exploit known gold and silver mines. The cost of this business does not matter, as long as it increases the amount of gold and silver. The gold and silver obtained should be sealed monthly. Borrow "reserve" foreign debt. The amount of debt obtained should be used exclusively for purchasing foreign gold for use as a fixed reserve for the legal tender. The gold obtained should be sealed monthly. When the "reserve requirement" policy is first implemented, there will definitely be many psychological or technical difficulties and obstacles. We believe that these difficulties and obstacles are temporary; as long as we can muster a spirit of fearless revolution, what difficulties and obstacles cannot be overcome?</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the "reserve requirement" policy is a policy of establishing credit and is the only effective way to restore the people's faith in the legal tender.</p>
<p>In this way, the vicious cycle of inflation will be restrained and will no longer run wild. With the formidable enemy removed, stabilizing the currency value, reducing the fiscal deficit, and stabilizing prices can all be carried out smoothly and achieve results. Then, China will not fall into the abyss of financial bankruptcy and economic collapse. Not only will the victory of suppressing the rebellion come soon, but the great plan of national construction can also be realized soon.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on an Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>(I) Lipstick</p>
<p>A simple sketch of an image of Guanyin, with a circle of light ink haloed above her head, and a white lotus flower beneath her seat. On the left corner, a touch of lipstick is carefully imprinted, extraordinarily vivid, that is the writer's seal.</p>
<p>(II) New Dress</p>
<p>A glass is the new dress of fine wine. In the Tang Dynasty, the crimson wine had already donned a luminous cup. Modern champagne, lemon-like pale yellow, must wear a gorgeous long robe, a tall, conical glass. (III) Brightness</p>
<p>When beloved friends arrive, the whitewashed walls demand brightness, the mirror on the wardrobe demands brightness, the glass windows demand brightness, the tables and chairs must be bright, even oneself must re-groom, and adorn oneself brightly: Turn on all the lights!</p>
<h3>Autumn Song</h3>
<p>— Xu Minghuai</p>
<p>Dusk</p>
<p>Several gusts of gentle wind, a burst of cool rain, the mountain country's dusk is already painted with the full flavor of autumn.</p>
<p>The remnant cicada drags out its hoarse, trembling voice, lamenting the loss of golden years; the night jasmine protects its last green bud, shrinking, tearfully drooping sadly. A sweet dream under the Judas tree, is the only red embellishment in gray days! The thin poet will wipe away tears on its last delicate petals, telling it that though autumn comes, though winter comes, yet afterwards comes the rainbow-like spring; telling it that though the footsteps of dusk draw near, beautiful news, on the other side of the setting sun behind the mountain, is stirring up the light dust of dawn, the crickets' low murmur trembling in the morning breeze.</p>
<p>As the dusky-blue sleeping robe of dusk falls, the lingering sound of cicadas has already vanished in the twilight, the crickets are chattering again at the base of the wall, as if the senile cough of an old man nearing death, the depressed sigh of a distant traveler, sobbing……</p>
<p>Bats, the poets of dusk donning their black evening dress are patrolling the sky, in haste, are they searching for their lost poems, dreams?</p>
<p>Fallen Leaves</p>
<p>The green leaves are already filled with a vague, longing heart, they will depart from this bustling world, embarking on another unfamiliar journey.</p>
<p>The benevolent baptism bestowed by Father Time has long become a thing of the past, the passionate solace and the green embellishments have also withered. Looking forward, an endless, unending road, thorns crisscrossing; how can one who has walked a smooth and warm road bear to fall into a precarious, impoverished end? Recalling the past, who can bear to see the coldness and indifference of the future? Green leaves, they will shed their green coat, abandon all that has been bestowed, starving, dry, dedicating themselves to the next generation. They are heroes in D'Annunzio's pen, generously sacrificing everything for love.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully bidding farewell, and tragically lost in the wind and rain. Listen to the fallen leaves sing their desolate elegy; searching, searching, cold, cold, clear, clear, miserable, miserable, wretched, wretched. As if the sobbing at Xunyang River, the sighing on the banks of the Yi River, the sobbing of the frustrated, the bleak sigh. Thinking of Baudelaire's poems:</p>
<p>"I tremble as I listen to each falling leaf,</p>
<p>Falling on the thick pile, the echo more urgent.</p>
<p>My mind is like a wall about to collapse,</p>
<p>The heavy battering still striking without pause.</p>
<p>This monotonous weeping, stirs my imagination,</p>
<p>As if someone is fastening the coffin, for whom? For the past summer, the present autumn,</p>
<p>And mysterious sounds, as if a funeral." (Autumn Song) A trace of sorrow arises in my heart. Recalling Paul Verlaine's poems: "I wish to go in the desolate wind,</p>
<p>Let it, torture me,</p>
<p>Here - there</p>
<p>Like dead leaves on the ground."</p>
<p>I realize that this must be a portrayal of the human heart, a realistic depiction of life. Zhang Ruoyan's Aesthetic Sense of Autumn</p>
<p>One dim autumn evening, I sat silently in a quiet study. I had just woken from a nap. Outside the curtain, a light rain was falling, raindrops dripping on the thick branches and tall trunks of the plane trees, a kind of melancholy and distant tone that made one feel lost! "Sparse rain drips on the plane trees," I don't know how many widows and widowers' melancholy feelings were stirred.</p>
<p>Autumn makes people think of red leaves, sparse forests, snowy reeds, purple crabs... A Yuan dynasty short verse says, "Wild geese cry, reed leaves age, heron shadows, lotus flowers cold," depicting the wild scenery of an autumn river. It is like a painting, stirring up my longing for autumn.</p>
<p>Spring is beautiful with flowers, summer with fresh leaves, but spring and summer are heavily made up, filled with an excessive amount of the atmosphere of the mundane world. But autumn is a masterpiece created by the Creator using superb skills. It is like Su Dongpo's writing, flowing smoothly without a trace. Its charm is even better than spring and summer. The clarity of autumn is like a bright moon, its gracefulness is like a deep</p>
<p>One deep autumn, I was walking in a village. When the setting sun was slanting, I wandered by a dried-up lake. Several rows of withered willows awaiting shearing were planted on the winding path. The lake was full of messy, tattered reeds. Suddenly, countless silvery-white egrets flew up from the reed cover, scattered across the sky like ink dots, dancing drunkenly with the reed catkins on the lake blown by the west wind, showing a tragic and desolate artistic conception. Although it was only a brief stay, it gave people a long-lasting aftertaste.</p>
<p>Many people think that autumn is a season of sadness. Literary figures and poets, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, are particularly sensitive to it. Some people compare it to "Death's harvest season." Perhaps autumn's maturity and fullness aroused Death's jealousy, forcing it to hastily enter the tomb. The American poet Longfellow compared autumn to a helpless old man. In fact, they have all erased the glorious parts of autumn. Because autumn alone bestows upon us enough aesthetic sense to be intoxicating.</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>— Pei Yin</p>
<p>A cool dusk</p>
<p>The crickets before the steps sing the song of autumn for the first time. Last night, I heard autumn passing through the forest, caressing the fertile fields, crossing the western mountains.</p>
<p>Coming to my orchard, autumn has two red and long wings, scattering the breath of autumn everywhere.</p>
<p>The fields abandon their half-year's green, wearing a light yellow long coat. The west wind smiles at the season's abundance, plating the mountains and forests with a red coquetry...</p>
<p>For the sake of mankind,</p>
<p>Autumn brings the season's and cages.</p>
<p>Ripe fields</p>
<p>Bumper harvest of fruit</p>
<p>A loud laugh ripples in the countryside. Autumn</p>
<p>I gaze at the flowing water carrying red leaves. Listen to the west wind singing playfully.</p>
<p>Let the red leaves fall on my shoulders...</p>
<h3>Random Notes on a Clear Autumn</h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>Autumn Mountains</p>
<p>On clear days, climbing mountains and wading through water, it is a pleasure to appreciate the scenery in autumn. See the maple leaves as red as a drunken old man's face, the leaves of the Chinese tallow tree dotted all over the mountains, like a young girl's rouge. And the yellow leaves have not yet begun to fall with the wind, pin a red leaf on the lapel of your clothes, as beautiful as if hot blood were sprinkled on a battle robe, on the way home one feels much younger.</p>
<p>Autumn Suburbs</p>
<p>The autumn scenery of Jiangnan is also very beautiful in the plains, with verdant trees and yellow flowers everywhere. Treading on your leisurely footsteps, linger as much as you like in this unwithering grassland. The autumn suburbs are more picturesque than poetic. Thatched cottages, plowing cattle, village women, shepherd boys, small bridges, flowing water... all are the best painting subjects. Bringing your tools, pick a quiet spot at will, draw a watercolor or sketch, it is your best harvest.</p>
<p>Autumn Water</p>
<p>Water is a symbol of tenderness, between the clear autumn lakes and mountains, sharing a boat with a few friends in conversation and laughter, letting the small boat emerge and disappear among the remnant lotus and dark bridge caves, is also the most pleasant state. If you are on Xuanwu Lake at this time, watching the setting sun hanging on the gray city walls, the lake waves are as bright as brocade, and in the distance, you can see a corner of the ancient Jiming Temple, and the two peaks of Zijin Mountain are shrouded in the vast twilight, in the nostalgic mood, you can also feel a faint sorrow.</p>
<p>Autumn Flowers</p>
<p>The deep autumn around the Double Ninth Festival makes people feel sentimental, even without wind and rain there are some sorrows, but when you enter the garden where autumn flowers are in full bloom, your eyes immediately light up, and your mood also becomes cheerful. Seeing this garden full of yellow and purple chrysanthemums, if it were not for the surrounding bleak scenery as a foil, one would undoubtedly have entered the embrace of spring.</p>
<p>The frost-covered autumn chrysanthemums are not only for those with a poetic interest to appreciate, even vulgar peddlers should have their enjoyment, but those who currently claim to be noble and have had spots of dirt in the past few years, I wonder if they feel ashamed in front of the flowers?</p>
<p>Cherish this fleeting beautiful scenery, I fear that when the autumn flowers have withered, only a lonely piece of bright autumn light will be left in Jiangnan.</p>
<h3>Playfully Titled Drawing Bamboo</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Several branches of bamboo without leaves or poles, not because of perfunctory politeness; when the price of ink is the same as the price of gold, cherishing ink like gold is truly the case.</p>
<h3>Green Bamboo</h3>
<p>— Chen Shuren</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"According to my estimate, it should be enough." Yaoqun seemed very confident. "In the devil's special agent headquarters, besides the four of us here, there's also Mai Shafu. In addition, there are the two good hands Xiaolaohu brought last night, and our two small leaders from outside the pass: one is the old Long, and the other is Wu Shuo. We can't do anything else, but hide in the dark and fire a few shots at them, set a few fires to draw that thing all over the place. Then we can do a concentrated shooting, which should stir him up a bit."</p>
<p>Yaoqun said so much about her plan, but the impression I absorbed was shallow. I pondered for a while, wanting to reorganize what Yaoqun had said in my mind. In the midst of recollection, I felt that there were still many problems that I didn't quite understand, so I had to bring them up one by one. Just as I was about to prepare to ask questions, a terrifying shadow reappeared in my mind; this was because I had been away from my temporary base camp for two or three hours; I was afraid that something unexpected had happened there. Thinking of this, I quickly made a gesture to Big Fool "04": "Please go back and take a look quickly, see if there's any news; go quickly and come back quickly!" After speaking, I watched "04" set off, and then I asked Yaoqun the questions I wanted to ask:</p>
<p>"Miss Ji, assuming we launch a night attack tonight, do you think all the people under my command should participate?"</p>
<p>After listening, Qun pondered for a while: "On this point, I think you need to decide for yourself; because I don't know how you make your appearances in this area."</p>
<p>"Isn't it still my old job—Crane See's personal secretary, and head of the action branch—but I'm very confused right now, and I can't decide whether the people on our side should participate." This was because I had this doubt due to thinking about the consequences of participating.</p>
<p>"Then…" Yaoqun pondered for a moment; "How about we come up with a compromise, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"What kind of compromise?" I was a little confused; so I stared blankly at Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"I think before the night attack, Brother Ji Hu should give you a heads up; or let Mr. Shen (i.e. 04) come here once at 8 pm, after you get the news of the night attack, you should respond to the situation at the time, consider the matter, either participate, or mix with the Japanese special agents, see what actions they have during the night attack. What do you think?"</p>
<p>I nodded: "This method is not bad… But you didn't know that the Japanese army would also launch an offensive at midnight tonight when you planned the night attack earlier. Now that Brother Dingyuan has obtained this information, has your plan to launch a night attack changed at all? For example…"</p>
<p>Qun immediately interjected, very resolutely, "I plan to move it up an hour—that is to say, the devils are preparing to attack at midnight, we will launch around eleven o'clock; in order to catch them off guard. But it is still not very certain at the moment, because I am still waiting for Mai Shafu's information from last night…"</p>
<p>"Um… I suddenly thought of Mai Shafu's problem. This guy has also put a knot in my brain, and I have long wanted to analyze the role she is now playing more clearly: "I am still a little unclear about Mai Shafu's actions…"</p>
<h3>One Gain from Writing</h3>
<p>— Translated by Rushui</p>
<p>A. Trollope put down his pen almost seventy-five years ago, and even now, he is still one of the great writers. But in his own eyes at the time, he confessed to being a vocabulary factory—meaning that he first produced a large number of words and then retailed them. In his autobiography, he mentioned the mechanical method of his work, saying:</p>
<p>"When I start a new book, I always prepare a diary, divide it into weeks, and then decide how much work to complete in those times.</p>
<p>"I then immersed myself in my work, day after day, and I stipulated how many pages to write. If I had a moment of laziness, the record of my work would enlighten me, warn me, and tell me not to slack off in my work.</p>
<p>"Depending on the situation, I prepare to write a certain number of pages per week. On average, there are always forty pages a week, a minimum of twenty pages, and sometimes it rises directly to one hundred and twelve pages. Because the number of pages is vague, I decided that each page should have at least 250 words, and I was afraid that the writing would become more and more blurry, so I wrote and calculated at the same time.</p>
<p>"I do this kind of transaction with the publisher, that is, how many words are how many words, it is my own responsibility if there is one word short, but there will be no cheap things for them if they exceed the quota.</p>
<p>"I am used to putting the clock in front of me, and I have to write 250 words in a quarter of an hour. Later, I found that 250 words in a quarter of an hour is almost predictable."</p>
<p>In the first twenty years of his writing career, he wrote twenty-four books, some of which were four or five parts—at that time, he worked in the British Post Office and had no free time all day long. Therefore, whenever he had time, he would urge himself to write. He gave his servants extra remuneration every week, asking them to wake him up every day, so that he could start working at 5:30.</p>
<p>He trained himself to be able to write anywhere, he took advantage of the train to travel, and he carried the booklet he had designed in advance with him. After returning home, he asked his wife to proofread for him. Sitting on the boat, he did not let go of the time to hide in the small room, preparing to avoid seasickness.</p>
<p>He does not regard himself as a genius. He said, "In my opinion, a shoemaker should also expect his inspiration to come, isn't it too ridiculous?</p>
<p>He has been engaged in writing for twenty years. He has written fifty books, most of which are two to five parts each. He has not boasted of writing immortal works, nor does he intend to pass them on to future generations. He has a recognized masterpiece called Barchester Towers, and he only hopes that he will not be completely forgotten by the world in twenty-five years after publication.</p>

<h3>Cosmic Rays</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Atomic energy can be used by the most intelligent human beings as a weapon to end World War II. Is it possible that cosmic rays cannot be used as a new weapon in World War III?</p>
<p>The psychology of ordinary people is always shocked by the power of the atomic bomb and regards it as the most powerful thing in the world, but they do not know that there is such a cosmic ray in the mysterious universe that has more energy than the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Cosmic rays have long been an important issue studied and explored by scientists twenty years ago. It has been proven and confirmed that cosmic rays are a kind of particle with extremely high energy. It exists in almost all parts of the universe like photons and electrons, and radiates to the vast star clusters at all times. After entering the Earth's atmosphere, it can only exist in the high sky one hundred miles above the ground, that is, the ionization layer that reflects high-frequency radio waves. Because when the particle group of cosmic rays shoots into the atmosphere at an alarming high speed, it collides with the atomic nuclei in the air and tears it apart to form ionization, which is the cause of the ionization layer. And these cosmic rays that have been collided and connected become particles with higher speeds than themselves. These particles continue to move forward and reach the ground.</p>
<p>This kind of high-speed particle that collides with air atoms is called Meson. Its mass is 200 times larger than that of an electron, but its life is extremely short, about one millionth of a second. Also, because the density when it reaches the ground is very small, people are not injured or painful at all, even though they are impacted or penetrated by hundreds of these intermediate particles every second. Otherwise, everything on the earth will become radioactive after being penetrated by it. What a terrible phenomenon this is. This is due to the subtlety of creation, which has already tightly surrounded our surroundings with an atmosphere, preventing cosmic rays from directly entering and reducing its density and life. Also, if a meteor rushes into the atmosphere, it will also give it resistance, causing it to ripen and burn to incandescence or even turn to ashes and fall, so it will not harm humans. So we must know that air is not only designed for us to breathe.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about each individual intermediate particle. The energy contained in it is 200 billion electron volts, while the energy of Gamma rays is only 2 million electron volts, so the energy of the intermediate particle is 1,000 times greater than the energy of Gamma rays. If these energies are used to make weapons, wouldn't it be 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb?</p>
<p>Professor Robert A. Millikan of the University of California and other scientists used experiments to confirm that cosmic rays do come from between the stars. They also discovered that cosmic rays can be bent by the Earth's magnetic field.</p>
<p>Recently, scientists at the General Electric Research Laboratory announced that they have been able to artificially produce intermediate particles. This is what they created with an electron accelerator that can generate 100 million volts. Then, we are getting closer to the time when we can use cosmic ray energy. At that time, we will step from the atomic energy era into the cosmic ray energy era. Scientific progress is endless!</p>

<h3>A Casual Talk about Dust</h3>
<p>— Ye Lei</p>
<p>In a beam of sunlight coming in through a skylight, you can see countless dust particles: actively flying around; when a breeze blows, you can also see groups of dust particles, spreading like fog. Since we live in this dust, we should have a clear understanding of dust. Now let's talk about dust.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, dust can be divided into two types: large dust that can be seen with the naked eye, called "dust"; small dust that cannot be seen with the naked eye, called "fine dust". According to research reports, the distribution of dust: less in rural areas than in cities; less in high altitudes than in low altitudes; less in the morning than in the evening.</p>
<p>Because dust contains a lot of pathogens, everyone hates it. Usually we live in it, just like a frog living in a pile of garbage, and we don't seem to feel it at all.</p>
<p>Although dust is harmful to humans, humans cannot do without it. Especially fine dust, it makes a great contribution to mankind.</p>
<p>Do you believe it? Fine dust can create a blue background for the sky. Decorate that beautiful colorful glow.</p>
<p>Because there are many fine dust particles floating in the sky, these fine dust particles are like mirrors, which can reflect light; the light emitted from the sun contains seven colors of light waves such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple; among them, the shorter blue light wave is most easily reflected by fine dust and reflected into our eyes, so the sky appears blue. However, it is a pity that the ultraviolet rays that are beneficial to us are also weakened as a result, which is a fly in the ointment.</p>
<p>When sunlight passes through fine dust with a larger density or larger particles, it also has a reflective effect on longer wavelength yellow and red light waves, especially when the sun shines obliquely, the space through which the light passes is larger, and the reflection from fine dust is also more, thus forming a beautiful glow, especially appearing in the evening and morning.</p>
<p>During the day, relying on the diffuse reflection of dust, every corner is brightly lit. If there is no dust, except for the places where the sun shines, I am afraid that they will all become a dark world. At the same time, strong cosmic rays will directly hit the Earth's surface, affecting the survival of living things.</p>
<p>When pilots fly at high altitudes, they often see the sky as dark, and the stars in the high sky are sparse in fine dust, lacking objects to reflect light to make them enter their eyes, so what they can see is a piece of darkness. Flying in this darkness is like being in the night, and of course the starlight can be seen.</p>
<p>Poets who travel around the mountains and rivers often read the beautiful greenness of the water in the lake. Regarding this, it was once misunderstood that it was the surface of the water reflecting the blue of the sky. Later, Kings and others, professors of physics at the University of California in the United States, discovered that water also contains a lot of fine dust when using light waves to detect submarines. Sunlight enters the water and also appears blue due to the reflection of these fine dust particles.</p>
<p>In addition to painting a beautiful and unpredictable picture for nature, dust also plays an important role in the formation of raindrops.</p>
<p>We know that when we breathe on the glass, water vapor can condense into water droplets after contacting the glass. This fact tells us that water vapor must be in contact with a colder solid before it can condense, otherwise it will not condense even if the temperature drops.</p>
<p>When the water vapor in the atmosphere reaches a saturated state, if the temperature drops below the dew point, it will condense into water droplets with fine dust as the center. These water droplets will slowly increase, and when they are attracted by gravity, they will fall and become "rain"; therefore, fine dust is a necessary substance for the condensation of water vapor. These fine dust particles are called "condensation nuclei".</p>
<p>If there is no fine dust, the water vapor in the atmosphere will condense on the surface of any solid at any time, just like in the yellow plum season, everything and our own bodies will be submerged in humidity.</p>
<p>At the beginning of chaos, the surface of the earth underwent a long period of weathering before there was so-called "dust holding"; later, a part of the dust slowly turned into a colloid, and this colloid may be the beginning of life. Don't you believe it? When meteoritic iron rushes into the atmosphere, it is worn down by the atmosphere and becomes tens of thousands of iron fine dust particles, suspended in the air, and then transformed into chlorophyll in plant industry by the action of sunlight, and further refined by our digestive organs, before it becomes red blood cells in the blood. In this way, dust may be the raw material for making organisms. I hope everyone will understand dust and understand its relationship with human beings.</p>
<h3>All Kinds of Rocket Launchers</h3>
<p>— Chen Feng</p>
<p>Speaking of the history of rocket launchers, it was actually invented by our Chinese first. Because the principle of rocket launchers is the same as that of the Chinese "Gaosheng", which is to use the reaction force of the gas generated after gunpowder burns to push the object into the sky and then explode. Before rifles were invented, rocket launchers had been used in Europe, but the disadvantage was that there was no way to correct the explosion time, and the fuse was exposed to the air and was easily damp. Therefore, after the invention of rifles, the research on this problem was put aside.</p>
<p>Around 1930, someone in Xishan, Beiping tested rocket launchers. It is said that they could fire 4,000 feet high, but perhaps because the testers were Chinese, the government thought it was somewhat unreliable, so they did not pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Before 1932, there were many rocket clubs in Germany that used rocket launchers to explore high-altitude meteorology. After Hitler came to power, he put these groups under a military vehicle agency for research. From 1932 to 1938, preliminary success was achieved, but large-scale application still required many improvements.</p>
<p>The United States has always only had private individuals engaged in research. In 1937, an old professor conducted a public test in Shahan, but because the United States had not yet participated in the war at that time, private arms dealers thought that they could not make money, so no one paid attention to it. It was not until 1940 that there were larger-scale tests. At that time, five students (including one Canadian, one Yugoslavian, and one Chinese, Qian Weichang, who is now a professor in the Department of Aeronautics at Tsinghua University) from the Department of Aeronautics at Caltech (C.I.T.) collected tens of thousands of yuan to engage in preliminary research.</p>
<p>In 1942, the German V1 and V2 began to appear. V1 uses the principle of rocket launchers and aviation assistance. It had already achieved success in 1938, but the large-scale bombing by the United States hindered the mass production of V2. The success of V2, on the one hand, preserved the lives of many German Air Force personnel, and at the same time, due to its high speed (3,600 miles per hour), the British anti-aircraft guns were helpless.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has been engaged in rocket launcher research since 1938. Since 1940, due to the threat of German heavy artillery, it has been engaged in the research of short-range rocket launchers (30-50 miles). Its advantage is that there is no reaction force when firing, and no heavy gun mount is required, so its mobility on the battlefield is very high. When the Soviet army launched a large-scale counterattack, it used two or three hundred rocket launchers to open a large gap ten miles wide and twenty miles deep in the German army's position.</p>
<p>American rocket launchers are also short-range. There is one that can shoot 7,000 meters away. Its advantage is that it is low in manufacturing cost and easy to carry. In 1943, a small rocket launcher called Private was installed on American warships, which could shoot 7-15 miles. Later, there was Private D., which could shoot 25-30 miles, which has exceeded the range of heavy artillery. Moreover, ordinary heavy artillery must be installed on battleships because of its large reaction force, but rocket launchers have no reaction force and do not need to be installed on large ships, so small warships have become the most important part of the navy.</p>
<p>A recent American-made rocket launcher called Wac Corporal uses liquid fuel. Its outer body is one foot in diameter and sixteen feet long, with a pointed round head and a tail that has been reduced to 500 pounds. The main purpose of this rocket is to explore high-altitude meteorology. The liquid fuel is installed in the steel combustion chamber at the tail, using fuming nitric acid as a chlorinating agent and aniline as fuel. The rocket is placed vertically on the launch pad, with the tail about half a foot off the ground. Remote control is used for launching. When the fuel comes into contact with the gasification agent, the barrel containing the fuel increases the pressure due to the generation of gas. When the temperature is 2,600 degrees Celsius and the pressure is three pounds per square inch, the gas pushes open the tail valve and pushes the rocket launcher to rise. According to estimates, the height of the projectile's ascent can reach 43 miles, and it may actually be more than that. Ordinary clouds are one mile high, and balloons can rise to twelve miles. The meteorology we currently know is all above twelve miles. To explore the height above twelve miles, we must use radar.</p>
<p>Rocket launchers are not necessarily killing weapons. Their development is still in its early stages. The future improvement of rocket launchers will make a considerable contribution to the exploration of high-altitude climate.</p>
<p>The moon revolves around the earth, standing in a position where gravity and centrifugal force are balanced. If we can launch a rocket launcher that reaches this balanced layer, then the projectile can float in the air. If we install various instruments, we can measure high-altitude meteorology. But to reach this balanced layer, it must be at least one hundred to two hundred miles above the ground. The initial velocity of this rocket launcher must be four miles per second. Under the current technical situation, it cannot be achieved, because we have not yet invented materials suitable for such high temperatures (5,200 degrees) and pressures. One day, after the successful application of atomic energy, this goal can be achieved.</p>
<h3>The Science of Hunger</h3>
<p>— Sun Jialin</p>
<p>Hunger and pain, fear and anger, are the basic reasons that determine biological activities. "Solving hunger" is one of the most important issues in the biological world. "Sad intestines and hungry fire burn each other day by day" (Yuan Haowen) "If driven by hungry fire, how can there be no food on the flat ground." (Fan Chengda) Writing the feeling of hunger as "hungry fire" is not an exaggeration, because this ball of hungry fire can indeed drive people to run around, commit crimes and kill people, and do things they don't want to do.</p>
<p>People who are hungry for a long time but not hungry may generally think that the discomfort of hunger increases with time until they starve to death. However, the facts are very different from what we imagine. The feeling of hunger only lasts for a few days before it disappears, and then you no longer feel hungry.</p>
<p>A lawyer named Viterbi on the island of Corsica was sentenced to death for a political incident. He decided to stop eating and drinking to avoid the suffering of execution. In the last eighteen days of his life, he left a careful diary. On the third day, the feeling of hunger disappeared, and although thirst was often felt afterwards, hunger never reappeared.</p>
<p>The cause of hunger Everyone knows that "an empty stomach" is the cause of hunger, but an empty stomach (meaning an empty stomach) cannot explain the feeling of hunger. Within one to two hours after a stomach wash, you will not feel hungry, and at this time the stomach is of course empty.</p>
<p>Some people speculate that the dull pain of hunger is caused by the hydrochloric acid secreted in the empty stomach, but in fact there is no basis. The empty stomach does not secrete gastric acid when fasting; and people with Achylis Gastrica still have the feeling of hunger. So hydrochloric acid cannot explain the cause of hunger.</p>
<p>Some people have also created a theory: "Hunger originates from the swelling of the gastric glands. If fasting continues, hunger will disappear, because the gastric glands are completely depleted, and the abdominal distension will be restored. When the stomach receives food, the swelling of the gastric glands can be restored immediately, and hunger will be relieved." However, the swelling and contraction of the gastric glands seems too mysterious, and this theory still has no scientific basis.</p>
<p>The result of stomach wall contraction A hundred years ago, Weber said: "The empty stomach, the muscles around it contract strongly, so that the stomach cavity is lost, which causes part of what we call the feeling of hunger."</p>
<p>This statement has been proven experimentally by Washburn: Washburn passed a rubber tube through his own esophagus all the way into his stomach, and there was a large soft rubber ball attached to the lower end of the tube. During the experiment, the rubber ball was gently inflated, and connected to a pressure gauge and Float Recordey. These ingenious devices can record the movement of the stomach very sensitively.</p>
<p>Before Washburn felt hungry, and when the feeling of hunger had disappeared, the curve recorded by the stomach movement showed that the stomach wall did not contract. But when Washburn felt the onset of hunger, the strong contraction record of the stomach wall clearly showed it.</p>
<p>Washburn's experiment of seeking trouble after eating his fill of white rice finally proved the cause of hunger.</p>
<h3>Is Mutation a Chemical Change?</h3>
<p>— Hao Tianhe</p>
<p>The difference between mutations produced by short-wave radiation or chemical reactions is due to the difference in energy applied by these two types of reactions. The energy of short-wave radiation is usually powerful enough to cause a drastic change in the structure of the gene, transforming it from one stable arrangement to another. On the other hand, the reaction of the gene with chemical drugs, because it contains less energy, can produce less drastic changes, that is, transferring the gene to a moderate and relatively stable arrangement. In fact, after treatment with chemical drugs, the gene is bound to undergo changes to some extent, causing the originally stable gene to produce a new, unstable gene.</p>
<p>Since the first positive results were obtained with mustard gas, the work of studying chemical mutagens has gradually developed. The substances found, whether in terms of their chemical structure or their pharmacological effects, are related to mustard gas. Mustard gas has extraordinary penetrating power and is also a protoplasmic fixative. Items with these two properties are not necessarily mutagens, so what can affect mutation is definitely not osmic acid, nor picric acid, because animals will be killed after being treated with these two acids. At the same time, it cannot be said that every powerful vesicant gas is a mutagen, because Lewisite showed completely negative results in two CIB tests. Up to now, only three kinds of chemical substances have been found that can achieve the same effect as mustard gas. They all belong to this type of nitrogen- or sulfur-containing mustard gas, and their chemical formulas are as follows: (1) O(CH2·CH2·S·CH2·CH2·CD2, (2) N(CH2·HC2·CD3, and (3) N(CH2·CH2·CD·2</p>
<p>Assuming that chemical mutagens can directly act on the substances in the gene, then this matter will inevitably attract attention. What is of interest is that these active compounds all contain an unsaturated atom (: sulfur or -nitrogen). This atom may be able to combine with the substances that make up the gene. The activity of this compound will change with the type of side chains of vesicant mustard gas such as CLCH2·CH2, etc. This kind of structure, together with the tendency of intramolecular cyclization, creates onion compounds. These compounds, because they contain relatively active nitrogen (...N) or sulfur (:S), assuming that the effect of mutagens is due to the reaction caused by unsaturated atoms in the gene and compound, then it can be expected that replacing sulfur (:S) and nitrogen (...N) with oxygen (:O) will not produce active substances, because the compounds formed by adding divalent oxygen are unstable in aqueous solutions. (And oxygen mustard gas: O Mustard is not a vesicant gas.) However, stable compounds must be composed of carbon-chlorine group compounds, equivalent to carbon-chlorine mustard gas (CO Mustard). Unfortunately, it has not been tested yet. As for lacrimatory gas, chloracetone and dichloracctone (compounds with CICH2——side chains, replacing CICH2·CH2—— in mustard gas) have been observed. The activity of this type of compound is very weak. In fact, very clear positive results have not been obtained, although these two compounds may contain slight mutagenic properties. Sulfur-containing compounds and chlorcthylacctone, although they also have vesicant effects, the latter may be more active. But it is still impossible to use this type of compound for testing now.
