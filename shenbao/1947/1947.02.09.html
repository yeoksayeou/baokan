<h3>對華調處業已終止　美軍儘速撤離中國　馬歇爾在記者會上報告</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕馬歇爾國務卿，頃舉行第一次記者招待會，說明美國政府決定停止調停中國內爭之理由，乃由於美國對於此種有名無實之調停工作，不感興趣所致。並謂：駐華美軍將在可能範圍內，儘速撤退回國，但美軍之駐在靑島者，因其訓練中國海軍，俾能使用沿海及其他軍艦，故決定暫不撤退，青島實爲美軍仍擬留駐之唯一地點。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日電〕美新任國務卿馬歇爾，今下午以其任陸軍參謀總長持之堅强英武之姿態，舉行自華歸來後之首次記者招待會，馬氏從談凡四十五分鐘，論及若干世界問題，唯未言及蘇美關係。今日之記者招待會不同尋常，其中有可發表者，有不可發表者，亦有不可以其名義發表者。馬氏對關於歐州及有關未來莫斯科會議中之政策與建議等一切問題，未加論及，馬氏態度嚴肅，使慣於採訪應付從容深具經騐之記者，感覺冷酷。馬氏論及十餘問題，其要點如下：</p>
<p>關於一般政策，渠將依循杜魯門及貝爾納斯之政策，即以一切力量強化健全聯合國，使之為討論國際問題維持世界和平之工具，而使美國之力量在國際事件中產生作用，渠對根據此項政策，積極努力於和平解決之工作，使之成爲聯合國可籍以發揮機能之堅固基礎。</p>
<p>關於中國問題，馬氏稱：美國已終止參與三人小組及北平軍調部，國務院之聲明中，未述及陸戰隊事，然在渠一月八日之聲明中，此點業有表示，軍調部已處不能發揮作用之地位，如是渠本人杜魯門總統，及國務院，乃認爲形同虛有之調停，宜予終止，否則將使一般人士，尤爲中國人士發生困惑，因而引起許多其他複雜慨念。</p>
<p>少數美軍留駐青島　伍億貸款存貯未用</p>
<p>陸戰隊之去華，本有特殊目的，即將中國國內之二百萬日軍及東北之百萬日軍（最少數）遣送回國是也。此項工作於去年五月實際業已結束，然少數陸戰隊仍繼續保護軍調部，自秦皇島，塘沽，通至北平之交通綫，並保障其人員之安全，是誠爲必要之　。同時美陸戰隊亦負責保護分布於此大陸相當廣闊地區之人員。軍調部每週須與執行小組以飛機聯絡同時每日更須有無綫電之接觸。美國退出軍調部後，陸戰隊之保安任務亦隨之終止。一般人士對美陸戰隊之處理，有不解之處。美國之對華政策，杜魯門總統在去年十二月十八日及本年一月八日渠本人之聲明中，曾明白解釋，駐華之陸戰隊爲數甚少，並有一定之職務，目前尙有少數陸戰隊在靑島，協助訓練中國海軍以防禦中國之沿海地帶之海盜及走私行爲，該地海水深，海面大，美第七艦隊即碇泊該地。</p>
<p>關於對華之五億借款事，馬氏稱：杜魯門總統十二月十八日之聲明，已解釋淸楚，杜氏稱：美國進出口銀行計劃再借予中國政府經營之機構及私人企業五億元，實現此稱貸款計劃之協議，自須根據美政府於一九四五年十二月十五日宣佈之政策，此五億美元存貯待用並未支出。（尙有馬帥談話，見第四版）</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日合眾版〕馬歇爾國務卿在記者招待會發表書面聲明，聲明中提及中國時謂：渠與總統及國務院，均已放棄在華之調處，因渠等均感覺在此種砲彈或類似之和談繼續之下，調處「實非所宜」。此爲馬氏就任後初决出席記者招待會，並初次發表重要聲明，其內容之坦率，包羅之宏富，爲數年來國務院所未見者，參加之記者約一百五十人，爲平常之兩倍。</p>
<h3>受津貼貨物輸入美國　美可能徵附加稅　美總領事館昨發出通告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自我國政府宣布出口津貼百分之一百後，外商方面反應，褒貶不一。而昨日本市美總領事館，特以美國租稅條例中，有關外國採行出口津貼部份之規定，通函有關各出口商知照參考：該項通函略稱：根據美國一九三〇年所通過施行之租稅條例及美國海關規則：美國自國外輸入而需繳納美國關稅之貨品，如該項貨品之輸出國，於輸出時實施津貼制者，則該項貨品於輸入美國時，美國亦將課以與津貼額相等之附加稅。依據該項規定解釋，我國採行之出口津貼制，在將來對美出口貿易上，除少數在美國可免稅入口之輸出品如猪鬃桐油等外，其他須納稅之輸出品，殆已無法獲得出口津貼之實惠。又關於輸往美國之輸出品，美領事館亦着各出口商須在美領事館發貨單上，分類開列該項輸出品之任何折讓，回扣，或津貼數額，以憑查考。據美國領事館方面聲稱：美國戰時實施該項稅則規定時，對若干經濟落後之國家，亦有例外。且協助中國復興，原係美國之政策。故對目前情形，或亦有考慮例外之可能。惟亦尙待事實證明云。</p>
<h3>中國結匯辦法　美將提出抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕政府官員頃談稱：關於中國最近擬訂結滙辦法，對於若干種進口貨徵收百分之五十附加費一事，待其正式通知華盛頓以後美國或將向中國提出正式抗議。官方意見僉謂，中國此項徵收進口附加費及給予出口　　百分之一百之辦法，自可鼓勵出口貿易。使中國出口商人在國外貿易獲得相等於黑市之匯率，藉此獲利，雖屬合法，但進口附加費，或將引起美國之抗議，因此項辨法將使美國减低貿易壁壘，俾世界貿易自由流通之努力遭遇挫折。此事純係原則上之問題，中國至今尙未正式通知美國，但國務院對於此事已予充分考慮，一俟接獲正式通知後，即將封中國有所表示。</p>
<h3>蔣主席接受　法政府勳章</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕關於法國政府擬以軍事勳章分別贈與蔣主席及美國故總統羅斯福事，頃悉：蔣主席業已表示接受。主席於聞訊之後，曾曰：法國政府以殊榮加諸本人，深為感激。</p>
<h3>熊式一在英新著　蔣主席傳英文本</h3>
<p>已付印六月間可出版</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦六日專電〕成名作家熊式一，巳完成英文「蔣主席傳」，其中對蔣主席自北伐至抗戰勝利時期之勳業，叙述極詳，作者取材於蔣主席及其僚屬之函件與檔案，該書已在印刷中，六月間當可發售。</p>
<h3>三中全會提案會　各組召集人決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕三中全會提案委會各組召集人，人選決定如下：黨務陳立夫王啓江，政治于右任李文範，經濟陳果夫宋子文，憲政孫科吳鐵城。</p>

<h3>遼東國軍向南推進　距大連僅三十里　接收工作刻正加緊準備</h3>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕東北來人談：遼東半島國軍向南推進，先頭部隊距大連僅卅華里。據稱：駐普蘭店國軍於獲得金州蘇軍諒解後，三日已向前推進八十公里，先頭部隊抵南關嶺左翼過牛角山，向甘井子推進，大連巳遙遙在望。接收大運工作，刻正加緊準備，聞已決定將大連劃爲十二個區，並訓練警察，俾隨軍接收。市長龔　遂，最近可望隨熊式輝北來。</p>
<p>大連接收問題，尙在談判中。在普蘭店前綫國軍，頗爲各方關注。圖示（上）普蘭店國軍前綫警戒哨。（中）普蘭店市街。（下）砲兵陣地中之大砲。　（東北社攝）</p>

<p>〔本報南京八日電〕減刑實施細則，經司法，行政兩院數度磋商後，業已詳細商定，不日即可公布。聞最後決定之細則，與司法院最先所決定者無大出入。主要者為根據宣告刑減刑者，非根據法定刑減縮。又判決已確定且已在執行中之罪犯，合於减刑規定者，可由檢察官聲請法院而爲减刑。正在審判中之罪犯，法官於判決時，即應照减刑規定而爲裁判。執行徒刑中之罪犯，經减刑後其已執行刑期，已逾减刑後所應執行之刑期者，應釋放之。</p>

<h3>各部會及省市府政績　主席令切實考核　規定五項辦法限於四月底以前辦竣　東北礦廠人員傳令嘉獎</h3>

<h3>李宗黃對記者談　考核會過去工作</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕國防最高委會，日前決議將中央設計局，黨政工作考核委員會合併爲設計考核處，直隸國民政府，記者今特走訪考核會李秘書長宗黃，承答問如下：</p>
<p>問·貴會與中央設計局合併爲設計考核處，並隸屬於國府，不知有無法律根據，其職權與五院有無衝突之處？</p>
<p>答·考核處之職權，與五院並無衝突，至隸屬國府，乃事實所必要，蓋行政三聯制，固應遍布各部門，但總的設計與總的考核，只有最高機關國民政府有其權。至考核與監察，亦無抵觸，蓋監察注重官史之違法失職，而考核則注重工作效率，監察乃治權之下，而考核乃治權本身之制衡作用，數年來監察，考核兩制，只有互想爲用之效，並無重複抵觸之弊。</p>
<p>問·貴會與中央設計局合併後，將有何損益？</p>
<p>答·本會與中央設計局爲行政三聯制重要部門，而機構合併後，有百利無一弊，因爲精密合理的設計，必以事實及考核所提供改進意見爲依據，始能正確有效，而考核如不深明工作設計性質與國策，而徒注重其枝節的事務工作，則將失去考核之主旨，故設計執行考核三部份工作，亟須隨時隨地相濟相成。以前爲謀三部份工作之聯繫，曾有局會處（主計處）聯席會議之設置，此次改組，與主計處同隸國府，更能發揮積極聯繫之效，且合併後，經費與人負均可大爲减少，於裁員改政原則，更爲吻合。</p>
<p>問·貴會工作，外間多不明瞭，可否將過去工作概况，擇要見吿。</p>
<p>答·本會於民國廿九年十月成立，迄今六年，因性質爲幕僚機構，考核爲秘密性，對外不重宣傳，故外間不甚明瞭，自係實情。惟成立以來，僅政務考核一項，計考察政府機關有一千六百另四個單位，呈請裁撤之機關，有四十餘單位，由本會督促各機關成立設計考核委員會者，有六百一十二個單位。關於經建事業，地方自治，糧政，役政，禁政及一般政務的建議改進事項，有一千七百五十三種，均經呈奉主席核定，交主管機關辦理，於抗戰建國，不無裨益。在廿九年以前，中央及地方各機關所擬年度工作計劃中，龐大不切實用，或僅有預算而無工作計劃，經本會指陳其弊，並以計分法，以其計劃之進度，評判其成績之優劣，因而各機關之計劃漸趨實際，工作報吿亦較前確實，故平均成績，亦逐年進步，確收移轉社會風氣之效，即所用考核方法，亦日在進步中。</p>
<p>問·貴會現在興過去所用考核方法，有何不同，得失利弊何在？</p>
<p>答·過去考核項目太多，且未經初核，即由本會直接考核，不無驚廣而荒之弊，又所編報吿太多，送達較遲，致改進意見，往往失去時效。現各機關設計考核委員會多已成立，最近主席指示，今後將加强督促各機關實行分級考核及經常考核，限定中心工作，並側重時效，嚴予獎懲，本會今後側重總核覆核，其成效當更可增加，合併後與設計主計取得聯繫，當更能發揮其效能。</p>
<h3>谷壽夫三度受審　檢查官指出屠殺為有計劃行為　庭上宣布定期繼續辯論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕日戰犯谷壽夫，八日下午二時起繼續第三次公審，谷犯首對七日所提證據提出聲辯，（一）所提證據，大部份在中華門外，時間在十二月十二。十三兩天，此時期正在激戰，居民應已逃往安全區。（二）十二日全日激戰，無暇殺害平民，可謂絕不會有，亦絕不允有，更不能不知道。（三）各　區域泰半在被吿部隊防區以外，而爲一一四師旅團所在地，以上三點，請庭上特別注意。</p>
<p>庭長宣布集體屠殺</p>
<p>旋石庭長宣布集體屠殺案件，（一）十二月十二日，谷部進城後，即將被俘國軍五萬一千餘人禁於幕府山下，並即解往下關草鞋峽，用機槍掃射，然後將屍體投入江中，有當時死裏逃生之人證，可即提訊。谷辯稱：被吿部隊停留於中華門，實不知此事，恐係海軍所爲，亦或係主力軍所爲。石庭長續宣布（二）十二月十五日，有平民與國軍九千餘人，被押至下關魚雷營，集體用機槍掃射致死，其中有八九人未死，可以作證。谷稱：盼能多找證據，被吿係無關係的。石庭長續宣布，（三）十二月十六日晚，難民五千餘人自華僑招待所押至中山碼頭，被機槍掃射，當由人證梁廷芳出庭說明死裏逃生經過，谷即詢以是何部隊，未獲答覆。另有白敬宇亦稱係死裏逃生之一，出而作證。石庭長復訊谷犯曾否閱過攻陷南京時朝日新聞所載有兩日人比賽殺人，結果一人殺一〇四人，一殺一〇七人，谷稱：此事尙係初次聽到，被吿完全不知。</p>
<p>證人出庭陳述暴行</p>
<p>旋由去年在東京國際法庭作證之陳福寶出庭，略稱：有五點可以證明敵人暴行，（一）十二月十五日晨，有日軍五人將我輩攆至新橋，有三十九人全被槍殺，後被推入塘內，此事曾親眼目睹。（二）十四日晚有日兵帶我至住宅區搜財物，見一姑娘被輪姦。（三）十六日上午以我輩作游戲，凡被推倒即大笑，不倒即刺殺。（四）十六日下午迫我輩領至太平路，從火燒環球飯店，並見一日軍强姦已懷孕之婦人，結果竟吿流產。（五）一月五日至八日，再度大屠殺，似係預謀計畫。谷犯立稱：證人所述地域與被吿部隊無關。次由集體屠殺案第二案之證人殷有餘出庭說明，復有朱光榮陳述伊子被殺時，曾見該部隊携有　樣，上書「谷」字，谷犯當稱，部隊作戰時，絕無携旗寫字者，朱再稱，曾親眼見到日人在一草棚內强姦女子四人，姦後再用刺刀通至胸部，拉出腸胃，極盡慘酷。谷犯稱，當時絕不會有女人，　有蕭潘氏，陸高氏等多人吿訴丈夫，兒子被害等情，谷犯均予否認，至此，石庭長宣稱：谷部在保定，石家莊槍刦陳姓廿八箱財物，並迫令婦女肉體慰勞等，谷犯立即否認，下午四時庭長宣布休息。</p>
<p>檢察官詞激昂沉痛</p>
<p>四時廿分繼續審判，庭上宣布調訊證件完，開始辯論，首由陳光虞檢察官報告罪行如放火，，搶刦，強姦各項詳情，并南京屠殺為有計劃的整個行為，日人以其最大之力量，完成其曠古未有之浩刦，舉凡參加之部隊，均應負責，被吿係參加的，即應負責。同時十三·十四兩日間，城內僅有被吿之部隊，罪行更屬顯著。最後稱：中華民族向以寬大爲懷，不求報復，惟此項仇恨即十個，百個，萬個谷壽夫，亦不能洗刷如此外侮之沉痛，請庭上判其死刑。全塲鼓掌，谷犯面色漲紅，狠狽之態，侷促難安。</p>
<p>谷犯答辯一味狡賴</p>
<p>谷犯答辯如次：（一）保定强迫婦女慰安一事，全非事實，（二）中　門左近事件等，均不正確，不能承認。（三）被害者姓名，受害者種類，均不詳細，僅就當庭陳述，不足爲證，不能說是構成犯罪之事實，此在世界審判上無此前例。何年，何日，何地以及具體事實，均須提出，東京國際法庭對一俘虜之被打，尙待美國　被害人前往作證，在對質與多次訊問後，始能判定罪行有無。又稱，此種不合理的論斷，被吿覺得非常遺憾，希望庭上詳加研究，如中日證人均提到，再加以公正判斷。次說明幾點，認爲事實不正確者，（一）中華門附近雨花台一帶，有兩日激戰，松井會指揮平民至安全區去，被吿係駐軍於無人之境，自無殺人之事。（二）華北事件，當時財物之破壞。或係日機轟炸及砲火焚毀，或係中國便衣隊之破壞，不能認係被告部隊所為。（三）被告軍紀嚴明，隨時訓示部下，決無任何事件。（四）所稱發生各事，被吿未見未聞，亦未發出命令與　獲任何人報吿。末稱：被吿部隊全部六十五中隊，以一屬計，一中隊即殺了十五人，一大隊殺六十人，每日即殺一五〇人，決無此大比例。又被吿部隊共一萬五千人，在一周間三分之一出發，至十八日晨復有三分之一出發，至廿一日被吿部隊已開至蕪湖，南京事件或係被吿出發以後之事，審訊至此，時巳六時，庭　宣布，定期議續開辯論庭，被吿還押。</p>

<h3>白太夫人墓地　立約購買經過</h3>
<p>陳石君談曾淸付價款</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕上海報載成都通信，標題「胡中柱辭職脫黨，要向白崇禧收復失地，原因是銅梁祖墳被佔」，渝蓉少數報紙，亦登有類似消息，記者爲明眞象起見，特走訪白部長，承白氏之長兄崇勳先生偕陳石君先生出見，陳係當日訂立購地契約代表簽字人，叙述其中經過，頗爲詳盡，據陳云：白母馬太夫人於卅四年秋間，在四川銅梁湯峽鎭逝世，白家世奉伊斯蘭教，素不信風水之說，而教典垂示，且須速葬，不能奄至三日，因白氏卜居於此，熱心公益，地方對之，殊表好感，當田該　李鎭長載榮等之介紹，購買該鎭銅壁公路北首山坡空地一方，地名老　岩，就近安葬，業經雙方同意，訂立契約，買方係用白愼思堂名義，比因崇動先生等哀毀逾恒，特囑本人（陳自稱）與唐紀二人代表簽約。賣方則由胡中柱之姪胡肇　代表簽約，曾清付價款國幣十五萬元，並有胡中柱本鄉河邊塲胡鄉長到塲，在契約上簽名爲憑，白家承買後，即向銅梁縣政府申請登記，復經縣政府依法公吿訖，在契約上鈐蓋縣印，俾資信守，似此情形，白家實無侵佔情事。再報載胡中柱在招待記者席上稱：白家所佔伊地，爲黃家坡〔此地在銅壁公路南首，即前中央黨部示範農場及糧濟委員會女子工藝社之所在地〕，更屬錯誤，因白太夫人墓地在老鷹岩，與黃家坡相隔尙遠也。</p>

<h3>社論　英國交通訪華團的東來</h3>
<p>英國交通訪華團一行，在團長包爾文中將領導下，業於一昨行抵南京。該團任務，據中央社報道消息，在與中國當局商談延長英國海外航空公司航綫至中國；與我政府會商簽訂中英民航協定。但據南京方面傳來的報道，則謂該國此次來華的任務「係奉英政府命與中國政府商洽兩國未來在交通技術上之合作。」無論該團任務如何，他們的萬里來華，無疑地在促進中英兩國間的交通進步，因之，對於此一訪華團的抵達首都，我們謹表示我們的歡迎。我們所感覺到遺憾的是：據報傳消息，此一訪問團在華祇有數日勾留，時間短暫，對於我國的交通情况，恐未能獲得確切了解。</p>
<p>我們首先所不能不指出的，就是我國現代的交通事業得力於英國之協助者至多。天津上海的電率，創辦之者爲英人。京滬滬杭及津浦北寗諸鐵路，籌建者亦爲英人，至於內河及近海的航行，其由英人開發者，尤爲衆所咸知的事。在當時，英人在我國之創辦是項現代的交通事業固或別有所圖，但我國之因是而有現代的交通事業，却不能不對於有遠見的英國企業家表示我們衷誠的銘感。如今國內交通未復，橫亘南北的津浦路至今還沒有通車，此固我們所受禍國殃民稱兵作亂的共產黨之賜，但對於當初建設我國現代交通事業者，我們怎能不表示慚愧。</p>
<p>當戰亂之後，繼商業訪問團的東來而有英國交通訪華團的來華，這表示我們戰時的盟邦，對於我國戰後交通復興的關注，自然是一件足以欣慰的事。國與國的交往，原不是片面的，而是相互的；此次英國交通訪華國的東來，其主要目的自然是爲了英國本身的利益，本不待言。倘若他們的東來果在謀中英兩國間交通技術上的合作，那在交通技術比較落後的我國，應該不無裨益。但觀乎此一訪華團的來去匆匆，使我們不能不懷疑到底他們的東來，對於我國戰後交通的建設，究竟能夠有什麼裨益？</p>
<p>講到民用航空，最近我國民用航空的迭次失事，多少已動搖了一般人對於民用航空的信任。這原不足爲怪；但我們却不能因此而說民用航空在中國已沒有了它的前途。相反的，民用航空在我國的發展正方興未艾。我國旣與美國有民用航空協定的簽訂，聯美及西北航空公司的飛機得以飛航我國，且我國亦已派出飛機試航中美，又與法國成立民用航空協定。此次英國交通訪華團的使命，如果在商談中英民用航空的簽訂，應該沒有什麼問題。不過我們所感覺到可慮的是我國的航空工業旣不發達，生產飛航用汽油的能力又不高；在表面上是平等互惠的民用航空協定，往往兩面的實惠或未能相等，致在實際上又造成新的不平等局勢。對於這一點，我們願我們的政府當局能够注意及此。</p>
<p>至於如何促進民用航空的安全，近來國內外民用飛機迭有失事，慘痛的經騐，迫使我們對於民用航空的技術設備不得不有所改進。從澳洲墨爾缽傳來的消息，國際民用航空組織的空運管理委員會已決定在南太平洋區域設置若干管理站，而上海業已被選爲其中之一，將加强關於民用航空的設備和管制，以第民用航空的安全。加上了我政府交通當局，自經最近民用航空的迭次失事以來，也正在設法改善民用航空的技術設備。有此兩重措施，相信今後我國民用航空必將更有發展。</p>
<p>英國在民用航空事業上是先進，它的海外航空事業集中於英國海外航空公司，其所經營的航綫遍及五洲。在航空工業上，英國亦有使人注意的發展，此次英國交通訪華團的東來，我們不但希望中英兩國間能够成立關於空運的協定；更希望中英兩國能够有民用航空技術上的合作，使我們正在發展着的民用航空能够得到先進國的經騐及其技術合作，而益助長其發展。緬懷過去英人對開發我國現代交通事業的勞蹟，我們對此一交通訪華團的東來，因此，寄予我們熱誠的期望。</p>

<h3>僞幣何不向敵算賬</h3>
<p>我們國家經濟面臨危殆時期，把敵人所欠的一筆現成債款，反倒放棄不討，這筆債款，就是敵人卵翼下之儲幣，聯幣……政府應該一律收集起來，向日本兌現，政府收集起來沒有？爲什不要日本兌現？教救中國經濟呢？我們戰勝國的法幣，都得對外負兌現的責任，日本爲什麽得享「從寬免究」的幸遝呢？我與日本誰是戰勝國，誰是戰敗國，使多少有頭腦的學者，莫名其妙，致使敵僞儲聯……各幣作了燃料，以德報怨，就是這樣解釋嗎？</p>
<p>老百姓手中之敵僞儲聯……幣，都是米粒實物，血汗眞貨換來的，任聽其作廢，當成燃料，權利讓敵人安全去享受，政府之寬大政策，係慷他人的慨，恐怕新舊約上，大學中庸上，三民主義上，都找不出根據來吧。</p>
<p>政府以一元法幣，得收二百元儲幣，持以向日本兌回現來，救教中國經濟之危迫，這筆生意不算不合理，何况老百姓面臨在飢餓綫上呢？老百姓旣無渡海求兌之力，又無向敵交涉之權，政府替老百姓討兌，實在有其責無其能呀，請政府大發慈悲，行行方便吧！</p>
<p>日本政府機構構，除軍事外，完全與戰前一樣，並不像德國那樣破碎，尤其今日之”本政府是專對戰勝國履行義務的政府，我憑僞儲鈔面向他討兌，他是毫無理由推諉的，而且麥克阿　元帥，坐鎭東京，對我名正言順理直氣壯之要求，萬無不協助之理，我政府情甘放　，不肯去兌，日本自然不肯找在中國門上來還這筆賬。</p>
<p>或者說：「日本賠償損失正在進行。」這話不能相提並論，賠償損失是戰敗國應負的特種義務，是指事物估價，可多可少，僞幣有定量，票面有定歡，或出或入是商行爲，國際有通例，性質不同，不必小題大作，援引戰勝國之威風，請政府稍加考慮，責日兌現省力　？（李炳衛）</p>

<h3>美擁護聯合國機構　竭力主張實施普遍軍訓爲外交後盾　國務卿馬歇爾闡明政策</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓七日電〕國務卿馬歇爾本日在其首决招待記者會中稱：渠將遵循杜魯門總統及前任國務鄕貝爾納斯所採取之政策，維持美國對聯合國有力之支持，並積極全力參加擬定和平之協議。</p>
<p>馬歇爾向一百餘名新聞記者演講，重申美政府全力支持二月四日安理會美代表奧斯汀所採取關於裁軍問題之立塲。馬帥演講逾三十分鐘，然後答覆各記者之詢問。國務院透露馬帥一部份之聲明如下：</p>
<p>總統與貝爾納斯之政策，亦即余之政策，在於盡力加速並究成聯合國，作爲討論國際問題與維持國際和平之工具，俾使我國之勢力伸入國際事務中。此外，並積極全力參加擬定和平協議，此種協議將成爲永久之基礎，使聯合國能履行其任務。</p>
<p>二月四日參議員奧斯汀在安理會所發表關於裁軍問題之聲明，一如渠所稱，係代表美政府澈底考慮所得之意見。吾人所追求之目標爲和平，而以集體安全爲可靠之基礎。美政府將與其他各國合作，以求儘速達到此一目標。余以爲此乃裁軍途上之第一要着，而此一途徑非簡短而便利者。</p>
<p>國際管制原子能以及其有效之保障，至屬重要，就通常之意識言之，此並非縮軍之問題。此項極富摧毁性之力量一且未加管制，人類即難一日或有安全之感覺，此亦即吾人最重視解決此項問題之原因。對於和的各項重大問題，獲致一列强均能認可之解決方案，亦爲建立眞正安全所必需者。在覓得此項解決方案前，任何眞正縮軍，甚或任何實際减縮軍備，亦難望實現。余深信美政府將審愼規避一九二一年後單獨縮軍及限制軍備之悲劇重演。縮軍問題並非感情用事所能解決者，令日吾人應就實際之途徑解決之。</p>
<p>馬歇爾並强調宣稱在確立集體安全制以前，美國決不裁减軍力，同時爲支持美國之外交政策起見，必須實行普遍軍訓。</p>

<p>馬氏述及出席外長會議之美代表人選問題稱，余隨員之人選，將與紐約及巴黎外長會議時貝爾納斯國務卿之隨員人選頗爲近似。換言之，可謂余將由原班人馬偕同與會。希望屆時余之副手將爲墨飛氏，克萊將軍亦可望成爲美國代表之顧問。參議員范登堡及康納利已聲明立塲，事前曾與余會商頗久，余透澈了解兩氏之立塲，且完全聆取彼等對兩黨外交政策一般要點之支持。蘇聯大使館現已正式照會吾人，謂屆時蘇方所接待之新聞記者人數以十五至廿名爲限，吾人現正要求蘇政府增加此項數字。吾人亦設法爲新聞記者取得廣播設備，前此吾曾與莫洛托夫討論此項問題，史密斯大使前此且曾就准許廣播之問題發表意見·聲請前往莫斯科之新聞記者共有七十三人，但其中旣有選擇問題，國務院關然不能選燴全體聲請之。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦局勢　美表深切關懷</p>
<p>關於巴勒斯坦問題馬歇爾謂：美國對於倫敦方面之各種討論，完全熟悉，美政府唯有希望各方將獲一致解決方案。美國對於巴勒斯坦局勢極爲關注，馬歇爾並謂，渠認爲英方在巴勒斯坦並無採取強硬軍事策略之計劃。</p>
<p>托管日委澡島　計劃並無變更</p>
<p>關於太平洋代管島，馬氏提及去年十一月六日杜魯門總統之聲明，該聲明謂美國將及早向安理會正式提出關於前日本代管島之戰略託治協定草案。馬氏謂美代表奧斯汀可望於二月十七日左右將此項協定送達安理會。馬歇爾繼稱，蘇英澳等國政府雖均有建議，惟各方對美國此項建議並不反對，蘇英澳各國咸認爲此項問題應留待對日和的成立後討論，馬氏謂美政府認爲此事不應遷延，惟在美建議正式提出後，安理會如決定此事需要展期討論，則美政府尙願考慮將此項問題展期討論。馬歇爾指出美建議戰略託治此項太平洋代管島之事與聯合國憲章之託治規定完全符合，按照憲章，該託治協定應提交與安理會而非提交與聯合國大會，因各島係戰略地區。</p>
<p>不滿波蘭普選保留行動自由</p>
<p>馬氏繼稱我政府對於最近波蘭選舉之立塲，已在國務院一月廿八日所發表之聲明中闡明無遺。我政府擬繼續密切注意波蘭之局勢。我政府對波蘭人民之福利極爲關心，同時將保留行動之自由權，以決定將來對波蘭政府之態度，並將繼續由華沙外交使團方面取得有關波蘭一切發展之情報。「爲此，美駐波蘭大使可望於不久之將來返國，與國務院會商，俾國務院接獲關於最近發展之初步報吿」。</p>
<h3>美蘇意見鑿枘　裁軍小組會議失敗</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約七日電〕安理會六國小組會，討論朱來教軍委員會組織規程，因美蘇兩國意見鑿枘，無法調和，今日已吿束手。各代表秘密討論三日後，認爲繼續努力無濟於事，最後決定以草案兩件交還安理會議處，其一包括蘇聯之見解，另一爲美國之立塲。小組會認爲雙方之爭執，顯爲原則問題，故無從妥協。安理會下星期三左右公開會議時，將重新討論此事。</p>
<p>泛美聯防</p>
<p>關於拉丁美洲，馬歇爾謂暹延已久之里約熱內盧會議，當即日召開，以與拉丁美洲諸國硏究西半球防御計劃，美國對阿根廷政府之態度並無變更，仍要求該國之貝隆政府肅淸納粹。</p>
<p>美匪談判</p>
<p>關於菲律賓美基地問題，國務卿謂渠已接獲報導，謂有關之商談已有友好之精神賡續進行，其間顯無特殊之困難。</p>
<p>論及木日參議員范登堡及米里金氏有關商的法案之共同聲明，馬歇爾謂該聲明顯示國會已與國務院合作，且使經濟事務亦如世界政治事宜同樣獲得兩黨合作。義準備停工紀念國恥</p>

<h3>美蘇間摩擦深刻　外長會議難樂觀　蘇對德問題或將提驚人建議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕莫斯科四外長會議定於下月問舉行，惟在會議開幕之前，美蘇兩國間困難重重，有加無已。國務卿馬歇爾正在硏究莫斯科會議所應討論之各種問題，而以兩國意見紛歧，日積月累，會議趨勢可受絕大影響。下列諸事實足以妨碍兩國情感：（一）美國曾照會蘇聯，請談判軍備租借法項下所借物資之最後結束辦法，蘇聯亦置諸不理。（二）美政府請與英蘇兩國採取一致行動，使波蘭舉行自由選舉，蘇聯已與以拒絕。美國認爲蘇聯此舉違反波茨坦協定，馬歇爾或將莫斯科會議中提出此一問題。（三）美國照會蘇聯，促其與中國協商撤退大連蘇軍辦法，並以民政交還中國，蘇聯置諸不理。（四）據華府當局報吿，美國請派遣負有文化使命之著名敎授等至蘇聯，蘇聯常置不理，美激請蘇聯人員至美，蘇聯亦報以冷淡態度。（五）美國人民在東歐遭受戰爭損害者頗多，國務院欲獲得關於個人及財產方面之報吿，蘇聯當局輒守口如瓶。在以上各種特殊刺激之外，蘇聯與西方列强在聯合國機構及英美領袖欲制止蘇聯擴張之每個區域，如東歐，中東，及斯比資貝根羣島等處，仍不免繼續發生衝突。一部份外交家認爲蘇聯策略，或將在莫斯科會議之初期提出驚人建議，對於德國人民可發生最大之宣傳效果。蘇聯將策動建設一中央集權强有力之德國政府，美國則欲德國採用聯邦制，使中央政府權力較弱，此點殆已確定。蘇聯甚或將提出要求，主張四強一律退出德國，早日交還德人。雖目前尙無此種證據可見，然在美國決策者則絕不忽視其可能性。我原則上表示贊同</p>
<h3>前日委治島　由美國代管</h3>
<p>我原則上表示贊同</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕關於日本委任統治地之處置問題，自美方宣佈擬向安理會提出，劃爲軍略託管地，由美國管理後，已引起聯合國間之討論，有主張此事須於對日和會中解決者。記者向中國政府方面探詢，據悉中國政府目前已接美方草案，中國政府在原則上將同間美方所提議之託管辦法，至此事是否應俟對日和會與日本其他領土問題同時解決，僅係程序問題，尙非十分重要。又關於將來對日和會，中國將主張應於太平洋沿岸國家區域內選擇地點舉行。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約七日專電〕據紙約前鋒壇報消息：英國對美國要求，對以前日本代管諸島嶼作「戰略」上之託管一事，雖不加反對而予以相當贊助，但要求對上述島嶼，應用美國所常主張之「門戶開放」原則。英曾向美國務院提出照會，主張美國對上述島嶼所擬定之任何法規，在採取行動之前，應在對日和的談判中討諭之。</p>

<h3>英全國煤荒嚴重　斷電結果影響國民經濟匪淺　今冬歐洲嚴寒實爲煤荒主因</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕燃料大臣辛威爾昨在國會宣布：由於燃料缺乏，倫敦，英國東南部，中部及東北部之全部工業，將於星期一起斷絕電流供應。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕英國政府今日宣布節約用電，此乃煤荒之結果，早在意料之中。政府令全國工業區各工廠自本月十日起實行節電。商務部發言人稱：工業萎頓，將使四百萬工人失業，同時數百萬家庭用戶亦受影響，家庭用電每日减少至五小時。商務部發言人並稱來日經濟之混亂，可與十年前不量氣之情形相埒。保守黨報紙暗示工黨政府將被迫組織聯合政府，以解決危機。工黨人士斥之爲「保守黨的如意算盤」。燃料與電力部長辛威爾今日在下議院發表上項激劇措施時，遭受工黨與保守黨雙方議員之交質。辛氏稱政府決定自十日起倫敦及東南區，西北及中部區域，不再供給工業用電，家庭用戶在午前九時至十二時，及午後二時至六時，禁止用電。辛氏希望减光制度不致繼續至三日或四日，至多一星期，節電令發表之日，倫敦恰逢多年未有之嚴寒，多數居民靠電力取暖·寒浪歷時一月，困苦之甚爲十年來未有。目前地面被積雪　單，氣溫在冰點以下。辛威爾所指出之斷電區域如倫敦，伯明罕與孟却斯德等，均爲英國最火工業區。商務部發言人稱：「英國之生產已歸消滅。」該發言人預料全部棉織廠及汽車廠均將停工。機械工業廠勢將全部停頓。人造絲業及用電工業之半數亦將停頓。數百艘海洋輪船，亦因遝費，出口禁止，裝煤禁止而封鎖港內。此項禁令通用於國內外船隻非正式估計受影響之船隻不下七百艘。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦問題　英方提出　折衆方案</h3>
<p>阿猶兩族各持成見</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕英國政府今日已向阿拉伯各領袖提出解決巴勒斯坦問題之折衷方案，同時巴勒斯坦阿拉伯代表葛羅萊則稱，此項提案倘若允許再有一個猶太人進入巴勒斯坦，即等於開戰。此項折衷方案似於同日提交猶太代表團。據阿拉伯代表團長赫賽尼稱：該國決定不閱提案內容，以待明日清晨，因「余確信一閱之的，將一夜失眠」。赫氏此言暗示渠已風聞新提案仍主張以歐洲難民營中之十萬猶太人立即移入巴勒斯坦猶太區。同時，英國殖民部長瓊欺今夜臨時邀猶太公會政治組長希篤克舉行會議，討論巴勒斯坦時局。聞瓊斯曾警吿希氏，英國提案公布後巴勒斯坦倘再發生嚴重暴動，英軍將採取主動。折衷案係瓊斯向內閣提出，主張准許猶太人移入巴勒斯坦，不限數目，外相員文則以爲無限制准許猶太人移殖，恐將引起阿拉伯人反英的「聖戰」。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕猶太及阿拉伯代表雖定今日分別開會討論英政府關於巴勒斯坦之新計劃，然料兩族恐均不能予以接受，阿拉伯代表團發言人伊拉克外長賈馬利重申阿拉伯決不接受允許猶太人移人，或將一部份巴勒斯坦土地歸猶太人統治之任何計劃，而猶太協會則以不獲適當面積之土地以建立猶太國而表不滿。</p>
<h3>美國人看蘇聯</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>蘇聯政府，蘇聯國家和蘇聯人民是三大事物，應有所區別。美國人對於蘇聯政府在目前應該是敵視的，對於蘇聯國家應該是中立的，但是蘇聯人民應該是美國之友。</p>
<p>美國人對於蘇聯的友好情緒，在一九四五年達到了最高潮，但此後又漸漸低落下來：這是美國民意測騐吿訴我們的。一九四六年民意測騐的結果，顯示美國人中百分之六十二承認他們對蘇聯的情感已不及一年以前那樣友好。</p>
<p>美人對蘇好感减退</p>
<p>在這一年中，蘇聯箝制東歐的政治自由，在伊期鼓動騷亂，掠奪中國東北九省的物資，在巴黎發表冗長謾駡的演說。因此美國人對蘇好感的减退實不足爲怪。這可以認爲美國人對於世界事物認識的一個進度，可是這個進，度並不很長，如果讓它停留在那裏，可能會變成退步。因爲這樣把國家和人民混爲一談，隨便把它們分成友好和不友好，是很天眞的看法。各國有各國的特徴，恰像人的個性一樣，可是並不那樣簡單。要矯正有關蘇聯的美國民意的曲解，須得明暸我們對蘇聯的好惡究竟如何，我們憂懼的是什麼，希望的又是什麽？</p>
<p>我們對於三大事物即蘇聯政府，蘇聯國家，和蘇聯人民，應有所區別。美國人對於蘇聯政府在目前應該是敵視的。對於蘇聯國家應該是中立的，但是蘇聯人民該是美國之友。</p>
<p>蘇聯政策阻撓友誼</p>
<p>蘇聯政府的專制政治，其範圍比較俄　時代更廣泛。別國的政體如何本來不關我們的事，可是我們以美國人民的資格，可以咒詛這一個政府所採用的方法和原則，蘇聯有兩種政策曾經屢次阻礙了美蘇兩國間眞正和平的發展。第一種是以共產主義救世，它已不必要地加强了我們和蘇聯民族思想的衝突。第二種是共產黨的孤立主義，它在蘇聯和美國兩民族間放下了一重鐵幕。</p>
<p>自從一九三九年以來，蘇聯已兼併歐亞兩洲二十七萬四千方哩土地，將八個獨立國家捲入它的勢力範圍以內。這些併呑的土地差不多全部是一九一八年以前俄國所有的土地，而新的勢力國大部分是歷代俄皇所控制或覬覦的國家。這不僅是蘇聯本身的擴展，而且是一種救世主義的夢想，它的預言者列寗說得最明白。他要推翻全世界的資本主義。誰宣佈這「神聖」的戰爭？不是蘇聯，而是少數狂熱的政治家。蘇聯是他們的工具，恰如國外的共產黨是蘇聯的工具一樣。美國爲了維護人類的自由，不得不抵抗共產主義的散佈，因此我們也就不得不抵抗蘇聯了。</p>
<p>檢查制度變本加厲</p>
<p>但是更糟糕的却是蘇聯政府把它的人民孤立起來的政策。目前的蘇聯檢査制度甚至較戰時變本加厲，這可不是蘇聯人民的思想。蘇聯人民雖然坦白地羨妒美國的財富，可是他們在廿五年中埋頭苦幹的成績可以無愧的。他們對於美國的自然的情感是一種友善而不獲滿足的好奇心。愛倫堡上月在莫斯科演講旅美印象時，聽衆滿坑滿谷，竚立恭聽歷兩小時之久。</p>
<p>俄國人民優點甚多</p>
<p>歷來俄國人民的愛國心向被一種渺茫的理想激越到最高潮。這無異是畫併充飢。偶爾經濟情形好轉些，像一九三三年至三六年時期的悄費品大暢銷，蘇聯人民算是歡天喜地的吃着那「餅子了」。他們在戰時始終做着和　時代的好夢：更多的房屋，更多的「文化」——文化浴室啦，文化自來水筆啦，文化冰洪濂啦，這些便是蘇聯人民所需要的東西。</p>
<p>但是爲了充實，爲了給養集中營裏的新俘虜，消費品工業不得不再度停滯了。然而蘇聯人民愛自由，愛同胞，其熱情幾爲他國人民所不及。他們動輒集合一起，可是他們沒有野蠻舉動；他們雖貧苦，却不是流丐。他們不幸而爲某種制度下的犧牲者，他們對付這種制度的唯一武器是忍耐和仁愛。他們要我們信任他們。希望我們不要再拿憤怒或嘲笑去答復他們的期望。（節譯自美國「生活」雜誌）</p>

<h3>日本政局杌隍不安　聯合內閣呼聲又起　麥帥命令</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京八日電〕上月杪日本八百六十萬人醖釀大罷工時，吉田內閣危苦纍卵，卒以麥帥一道禁止罷工命令，起死回生，吉田旣獲强心針，立即實行局部改組內閣，惟因改組後仍無克服勞動攻勢及經濟危機之把握，故仍洩露希望組織聯合內閣之意，伺機拉攏社會黨入閣。一週來進步黨方面極端不滿改組後之內閣，積極向自由，社會兩黨呼籲組織聯合內閣，惟因自由黨態度消極，社會黨能度愼重，第二决三黨領袖會議，始終未能實現，政局仍陷於杌隉不安之中，而議會復會日期，日益迫近。正常吉田一籌莫展之際，麥帥又致函吉田，囑於國會完成任務後，實行普選，吉田又因此獲得有力支持，因議會完成任務尙須三個月，至少獲得延長內閣壽命三個月之保蹬。吉田在此三個月內當謀從容布置保守陣綫，加强自由，進步兩與黨之團結，以謀普選時與勁敵社會黨一決雌雄。</p>
<p>惟此刻日本政局之暗流，仍極複雜。自由黨昨日決定放棄組織「聯合內閣」之工作，、然進步黨今日仍堅主樹立「救國政權」，其最後目的在聯合各派，驅逐吉田，同時自由黨內謀驅逐吉田總裁之動向，亦已抬頭，此事頗堪注意。吉田雖已放棄組織聯合內閣之意，然進步黨之工作一旦成功，內閣將陷於極端危險地步。</p>

<p>隊長卓厚道於招待調委會參觀新警訓練所表演之餘，對日前各報刊載之「消防夫人」一節，有十所辯解，彼謂：消防車速度之快，每令新消防警無法站穩，何况女流之輩，且是日氣溫在零度以下大雨紛紛，女人乘消防車赴火塲究何爲哉？」隊長復謂：自西摩路事件發生以來，各界對消防員嚴予抨擊，可謂體無完膚，然消防員雖問有一二不肖之徒，固非人人如此，所以，明哲保身之人，莫不紛紛表示倦意。調委會主委葛克信鑒於事熊嚴重，特表示於西摩路火案調査吿一段落時，擬　市長召集全體消防員訓話，以資鼓勵，並提高其工作情緒。</p>
<h3>南市救火會　會員義務</h3>
<p>旋調委會等又趨南市各消防處參觀，南市消防處係民營性質，分東南西北中及董家渡等六區。抗戰軍興，東區遭敵寇拆毁，南區被炸毁，西區因搬人舊法租界，得以部份保全。僅中北兩區，因被劃入難民區，幸獲無恙。南市救火會創於光諸卅年，經費全賴商民捐助，惟非强迫，目前南市救火會人員不多，計隊員十四人，職員十人，而義務會員佔八十人之多。隊員待遇並不優厚，自十一萬至廿萬不等，然會員大多係半義務性質，故毫針怨言。且遇警鐘敲動，消防員出發時，義務會員聞聲立即準備，俾使繼續出發。現被毀之東區救火會正積極修復中，一俟整頓完畢，即將招待各界前往參觀。</p>
<h3>等因奉此太多　救火亦受影響　官辦民辦　主要在錢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕火災調査委員會主任委員葛克信，昨日參觀南市民辦消防處時，向主辦者詢以官辦與民辦之利害得失若何？當由海市滬南區救火會聯合會常務委員毛經　答以，「有錢官只亦好，民辦亦好。無錢官亦辦不好，民亦辦不好。」又該區區隊長華念祖則答以，「民辦者可省却許多紙張。」語甚幽默，意蓋指摘政府中公文太多。毛氏並報吿常吳鐵城任上海市長時，曾建議將南市消防處統一，由政府負擔其經費。常時毛即加以反對，其原因爲領錢手續太麻煩。毛並謂，「等囚舉此」之冬，自古已然，於今爲烈。故必須加以改革，以節省人力物力。　對於官辦消防處，彼等皆不願作任何時批評，僅建議必須添聘義務會員，可作爲一般之模範，而提高工作效率。　又消防處長周兆祥對於目前公事手續之麻煩，亦甚感頭痛，彼曾謂記者：即使要買一隻螺絲釘，亦須先簽呈文，然後調査，佔價，打圖章，轉輾獲准後，爲時至少半個月。故周處長即將在參議會中揭出，請求增添活動金數百萬元，以資週轉。</p>

<h3>中航機天門失事案　檢察官調查原因　機航組否認帶金　職員態度傲慢官深表不滿　正靜候公司調查所告</h3>
<p>正靜候公司調查報告</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來飛機一再失事，已引起當局極度注意。本市地方法院檢察處爲中國，中央兩航空公司所在地之主管法院，故對航機迭决失事案件，均異常關切。本月二十八日中航公司一四五號滬渝班客機墮毁於鄂西天門縣一案，因該日氣候良好，失事地點又無山峯，而竟又失事，允屬費解，外傳有該飛機翼中私藏金條二百根，使飛行時失却平衡，故而失事之說。亦有人稱：有人從中陰謀破壞，在飛機起飛之前將一二重要處之螺絲釘撬鬆，故飛行稍久，機件發生障碍，以致墮毁，地檢處因對之格外重視，前日下午秒特派朱錫瑜，劉用之兩檢察官，赴中航公司査訪適該公司總經理沈德變外出，由主任秘書梁敬釗接見，據稱：一四五號失事後，公司常局已派營業主任商大經至漢口調査失事原因，正式報吿的二三日內可到滬。扭晤該公司機航組主任吳士，副主任陳鴻恩，王助等高級職員，據吳士稱：即使確有夾帶黄金七十公斤之事，亦不能造成飛機失事，因該機中僅有旅客二十三人，正副機司各一人，電報員一人，載重決不逾量。對螺絲釘被拔去或撬鬆一設，亦稱無此可能，蓋起飛之前機件必需經過檢査，毫無損壞，始能起飛，當並出示該機臨飛前之檢査報吿，以證明該機起飛前機件完好。同時對各外傳夾帶金條一節鄭重否認，願保證決無其事。渠摧測失事原因有三：（一）氣候惡劣。（二）機械中途發生障碍。（三）機司氣候航綫等判斷錯誤。檢察官繼又視察龍華機塲，並察看飛機翼構造，至晚始歸。昨日記者訪劉朱兩撿察官時，皆因尙在偵査期間，不便表示任何意見，惟對該航空公司職員傲慢能度，認爲對工作上亦有不良影響，似有改善必要。至該案之偵査。需俟公司之調査報吿到達後，始能有新發展云。</p>

<h3>馬鈴薯發芽期間　有毒持不宜供食</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕農林部中央農業實騐所，近據江西零都報告，該地佩民自廣東購來馬鈴薯（一名洋芋）種十若干，因栽種有餘，乃炒熟給兩十，（長七歲，幼五歲）共食。詎食後半日，兩十竟吿斃命‘故請示馬鈴薯種子內含有何種毒質等情。現經該所園　系解答稱：馬鈴薯發芬時。由於生理化學方面之變化，產生一種毒素，名曰「索拉寗」（Solanin　C42H76N19），此種毒質，多集積於芽　　及　層下，一旦入胃。輕者　　唱實，使之下痢，若食之過多，侵及腦部，可引起麻痺昏睡與痙　，孕婦食之易洗產，重者使心臘循環作用减退，血液中炭酸過多，循環停滯，而至於死。故萌芽以後之　薯，不宜供食。如欲食之，亦須厚削其芽眼及皮部，並宜浸水中數小時後，再泡煮之，方可供食，若不加以相當處理，即飼給牲畜亦非所宜。馬鈴薯於春季播種時，萌芽作用最盛，換言之，即分泌「索拉寗」毒汁最盛之時，該農民未加以去毒處理，即以之大量供兒童食用，兒童抵抗力較弱，故食後半日斃命，顯係中毒云。</p>

<h3>社會服務　讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>醫藥衛生</p>
<p>（一）肺病疑難孫鐵健問鄙人係肺病患者，茲有疑問數則，敬請指示是爲至禱。（一）本人打空氣針已有半年，最大容　爲７５０c.c肺葉已能壓縮達９0%至今仍不能工作，稍一行動，即心跳不止呼吸急促是何緣故？又打氣是否會誘致「氣喘」？同時，天氣較冷時，不愼受寒即氣喘，痰鳴，且不易咳出，是否爲慢性氣管支炎？應服何藥？（二）服多種維他命丸每日服若干？方可補償此消耗病勢？服用施貴寳多維他命丸後二小時內所解之小便何以會成黄綠色？已服多維丸，可否不再服魚肝油丸？市上所售之乳體丸是否較膠囊爲優？（三）極易傷風，經常服「阿司匹靈」是否能使肺病增劇？（四）頸部淋巴腺在打氣前曾有四處腫脹，（由硬核而轉變爲膿包者）已先後潰爛，經搽磺　素藥膏後先破之二處已收口，由此是否證明肺病在逐漸好轉中？使用磺　素有無副作用？</p>
<p>〔醫學博士唐仁縉答〕（一）肺葉被壓縮後，肺之呼吸面减少，若多動作，當然發生氣喘現象。（二）肺結核患者，需大量維他命，多服數粒較佳，小便變色，恐非服維他命丸之故，已服多量維太命丸。可再服魚肝汕丸（ＡＤ）。（三）注意氣候及攝生。阿司匹靈應少服。（四）大都爲好轉現象，無特效藥膏。</p>

<h3>央行運用閃電戰術　金價終被逼回頭</h3>
<p>由五九〇萬外回至五六〇萬關　較前收仍好卅餘萬美鈔憂續漲</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕烚赤昨再創空前高價，直至午刻一霎那，央行以閃電戰術，始將市價壓落，晨開五三二萬有求，開後即吿扶搖直上，一般心理咸存奢望，新買一再參加，竟暴漲至五八七萬，始有供給。加之時近配給，瞬吿回落。十時後，央行以五七二萬之價，配給一七〇〇條後，買戶再來蠶動，立起漲風，盤高至五九三萬，央行隨市供給三千條，於是回風轉盛，而退至五七四萬，惟買戶繼續盲目爭購，近午一度再升至五九〇萬外，孰料午收後一霎那間，央行乘隙削碼賤賣，一時缺乏買戶，回跌甚烈，市價竟喊低至五四〇萬左右而後略定，回升至五五〇萬外，午後逢週六毫無變化，喊價則微挺至五六〇萬關，結果較前收再好三十二萬，飾金掛高至五十八元，銀元再見升上，暗拆銀根尙平，息價不過一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣亦初漲後跌，美鈔暗市晨開一〇五〇〇及一〇八〇〇元，盤旋而升，高價見一一七〇〇元，午刻在一〇八〇〇元至一一三〇〇元問徘徊，午後逢週六無特殊變化，結果較前收再漲八百元，港票自二千元買價起，盤高至二三〇〇元，而後回跌至二一五〇元左右，較前收續昂一百元，港滙曾升至二三〇〇元有成交，後即有供無求，印滙二八四〇元，英滙三六六〇〇元，亦屬有供無求。</p>
<p>又訊：本市一週來，以金鈔賡續猛漲，而商品糧食各種市塲，莫不亦步亦趨，追蹤漲價。各種市塲，似咸屬買方天下。惟市面頭寸奇鬆，暗息亦未見高翔。據某專家觀察：此種現象，殆係投機市况，一再騰漲，法幣終日在市流通角逐，回籠之日旣無，而市况節節上漲，週轉率亦唯有日見其速。再加以各地金價較滬爲高，游資分向本市　集，故市場頭寸汎濫，未因各物激漲，而轉趨緊縮。再以一週來四行二局在票據交換所交換頭寸而言，三日差進九十億元，四日差進九十一億元，五日差進七十二億元，六日差進廿五億元，七日差進四十二億元，昨日中央銀行雖仍差進，惟以四行二局軋算，反差出四十一億元。可見一週來國家行局差進頭寸，數額不鉅。中央銀行對各行莊每週滙滬頭寸，每家雖仍規定爲三千萬元，惟悉：軍政滙款，並無限制。徴諸過去情形，其滙滬數額，常大於民間滙款，此亦爲增加市塲通貨之一大來源云。</p>

<h3>統丙憂起波潤　昨日獨漲五百元</h3>
<p>公債昨經環境助買，亦再吿上騰，統丙晨開二五〇〇元，一般心理對政府之改組，復起幻想，而扳高至三二五〇元左右，高後引起大戶脫手，乃又跌至二六〇〇元，最後在二七五〇元至二八〇〇元間盤旋，結果較前收漲五百元，甲乙丁均平，而戊種微升五十元，成交不下四百萬元。</p>

<h3>人造絲　索價雖高　交易缺少</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲上午仍瘋狂上升，一二〇號有光高山最大喊過六百二十萬元，買戶爲之束手，並無交易，迄後盤旋回落，結果五百八十萬元有二箱成交，下午因金價亦低回，且配售絲已有着落，聯營公司下週三四亦可發料，故市勢不支，討價五百五十萬元，但乏人還價，大致二十萬元或有人問訊，頗形疲軟，廠經昨市又高，不過交易仍柨，只做開D字等級幾担，價六百二十萬元，比上日大二十餘萬元，干經另祖出價四百七十萬元尙不肯脫手，市勢頗形堅昂，綢貨隨原料而續高，上午甚形混亂，結果美亞被面大十萬元，大誠格子璧縐喊一萬六千元，五千五百元有成交，華錦縐大一百元，上海絲織廠出品眞絲被面，昨喊價三百六十五萬元，但現貨缺乏，持貨者尙不願脫手。</p>

<h3>茶葉收購價格　茶商要求提高</h3>
<p>據茶業界消息，此次政府實行貼補出口後，該業情况較過去已事好轉，惟國內成本與國外售價仍未能合於理想，故今後出口量是否可望增加，尙屬問題，各檔外銷茶近日市塲做價，雖逐步堅昂，成交仍甚稀少，至中信局收購間題，現因政府補貼辦法發表後，茶商堅持提高收價，似已暫入停止商談狀態。</p>

<p>棉布價格審議委員會，昨日在社局舉行第二次臨時會議，出席顧炳元，吳叔方，董久峯等十餘人，由顧處長担任主席，議決如下：甲·由於最近金價騰漲，紡建開紗數量旣少，價格亦逐步提高，以致影響市塲正常供應，黑市隨之而起，但爲加速棉紗供應市塲之數量起見，擬呈請市政府轉請紡管會，將正在進行收購中之百分之五十棉紗，迅即簡化手續，提前供應廠商，以濟紗荒，藉以穩定紗價。乙。該會前曾呈請吳市長，對棉布審議會存廢問題，請予裁決，吳市長認爲紗價雖有紡建依市况決定，但審議會仍有存在之必要，故對如何改進審議價格方式及程序，決定五點：（一）棉布議價，由該會推定紡建公司，六區棉紡業公會，染織業公會，染布業公會及社會局各派代表一人組織小組委員會，在每星期一三五下午三時開會議定之，（二）小組會議價之標準，應以紡建棉紗掛牌爲主要參考材料，（三）議價如需增加，以不超過成本及市價爲標準，（四）如在市面變動較烈時，仍由該會召開全體會議決定之，（五）小組會議議定價格，由紡建公司及棉布業公會公佈之。丙。棉布商利潤，其中單白細布一項，利潤率减爲百分之十，其他仍爲百分之十二云。</p>

<h3>豬鬃桐油乘機漲價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自出口津貼辦法公佈後，我國主要輸出品之價格即飛漲不已，其中猪鬃一項，以昨日市價與本月六日以前相較，已漲起六七成之巨。一般猪鬃商人咸以爲有利可圖，持貨不放，乃造成有價無市之現象。桐汕價格亦飛漲不已，據中國植物油廠某負責人稱，在津貼辦法規定以前，我國桐汕價格已屬甚高，以國內價格與國外價格相比，的相差七八成，津貼辦法規定後，又漲起五六成，故國內外差價，已超過百分之百。換言之，即雖有百分之百津貼補助，桐汕出口仍須虧蝕，且近日美鈔黑市，驚人高漲，我國桐油出口恐仍不免走向香港之一途。</p>
<p>頃據腸衣業人士吿記者稱：該業在極度不利情况下，欣逢政府實行補貼制度，得慶復蘇有望，茲後該業希望增加輸出量，其一固爲補救其過去虧損，其二於抵補國家外滙入超，可効微勞，惟鮮腸收購價格，厥爲今後主要問題，本年春節後，最初價格，外埠客貨與本地貨平均扯價每副一千三百元，嗣以國外市况疲落，曾相繼下降二百元，自政府貼補消息公布後，各廠收價即恢復一千三百元原價，本日則已提高至一千六百元，較去年底價格，業經上漲三成，故公會方面，對提高收價，在適當尺度下，爲吸引鄕貨源源而來，雖事實上亦甚需要，然任意放價，勢將釀成自欺之結局，聞公會即將召開會議，討論同業採取一致步驟，俾限定最高收價。</p>

<p>外股昨繼續挺進，外商買意不怠，惟北帮乘高有所了結，略有回頭，怡紗英聯高價達一二三〇〇元及一三〇〇〇元而後稍盤，結果較前收計怡紗漲一成，會德豐業廣怡啤升一成弱，英聯紙業墾植各升半成强，鋼業平平。</p>

<h3>美國內政與外交　並論及弟三黨之形成</h3>
<p>— 紐約中美基督徒聯合會會長　荊盤石教授　寄自紐約</p>
<p>美國的政府在近一十年間，完全以民主黨爲中心領導政治，這並不是說因爲民主黨是怎樣的好，而共和黨怎樣的不好，也不是證明共和黨沒有一個人，或說民主黨的人才太多，這都不是其中最火的原因，而最大的原因是一方面由於國內外政治環境所使，加上由共和黨的胡佛總統所表現的政績太趨向孤立主義與資本主義，結果引起了人民的反感，（受資本壓迫）正好民主黨出了一個大政治家羅斯福，那時選舉羅斯福的不僅是民主黨的人，就是共和黨的人也選他，因爲在共和黨中的聰明人也知道自己的總統候選人是不爲人民所擁護的。羅斯福的當選，固然由於他的雄才大略與政治天才，但環境使他成功，實是主要原因。本來，他第三次連任已經已勉强，但因爲世界大戰方酣，美國爲聯合國兵工廠，人民都知道『老馬識途』的大道理，所以他第三次又當選了。在美國有總統歷史以來已經是少有了，不料到第四次選舉時又適逢對日戰爭正在緊要關頭中，人民仍是以爲中途改選他人，必因國內政治變動影響對日戰爭，他又在一個有利於他的國內外環境中常選了。</p>
<p>其實，在美國人民的習慣上，已爲空前又空前了，美國人民能那樣忍耐的連次選舉他，並不是完全爲了本身利益，反之，是爲了顧全世界大局，這些地方更證明了美國人民約有眼光，有時並不完全自私，按理說，共和黨的人很可不在戰前戰時擁護羅斯福，因爲　斯福的時代賜給美國的工會權利已超過他們的權限，後來甚至無法的束工會，工人，以致於每次工人藉工會要求增加工資，减少工作時間，無往而非不利，但同時資本家的生產品，利潤則仍不能增加，共和黨的然員多半是代表有產階級的，他們因而受損火者已數年，幸而在戰時補償了他們在羅斯福任內戰前的損失，雖然這樣，共和黨人在戰時還有不少人選他，因爲顧全世界大局，因爲可補償從前的一些損失，但是因爲國家的開支浩大，在戰時軍費支出增加，羅斯福的軍稅加給人民，是共和黨的資產階級最大不滿意他的，因爲稅太重的原故，資本家所賺的錢差不多百分之七十五給了政府，給果資本家的勞心勞血，往往不如一個工頭，（一個工頭常有每月一千元以上的薪水）尤其是政府的統制物價政策，使共和黨頭痛到萬分，而人民所得的　是黑市，這些政策，本來在戰時是好的，有益於國家的，在戰後本應立即停止，但因爲民主黨總統杜魯門先生的政策爲保守羅斯福原有各種政策而不知道因時制宜的大道理，更加使人民無肉可食，無糖可買，黑市流行，這時人民看出了，還是自由貿易好些，大家因爲競爭買賣，結果物價下降，這雖是共和黨的資本家所唱出來的，但因爲美國社會人民確實需要這個辦法，果然，試行之有效已經看出。</p>
<p>共和黨自胡佛總統以來，不得志者已將二十年，上面已經說過人民早想換一換共和黨來執政，因國內外環境所使，以致無法實現，但現在情形不同了，人民的忍耐已到最大的限度，雖然今日美國的工會勢力仍大到極點，（這是故　斯福總統所促成的），社會主義者，勞工，共產黨，日漸彭脹，但這些畢竟壓不倒大多數的民意，這個趨勢已充分表現近牛年來日潮明朗化，最初的例子如很多人民反對政府仍奮推行物價統制政策，重我政策，因爲人民認為戰事停止了，應再　向自由貿易自由競爭的時代，雖然民主黨說這是共和黨的資本家的主使，其實一般人民願在物價統制下鬆一口氣，也是眞的。</p>
<p>國會選舉　影響內政外交</p>
<p>美國國曹選舉——不僅　國，同時也是全世界關心國際政治人士最重視的美國選舉——國會選舉，今日已完全揭曉，因爲美國國會的選舉會影響到美國的內政外交政策，同時也會影響到與美國有密切關係的國家。中國的今日與美國關係密切，爲中美歷史上過去所絕無僅有的，中國人的眼光看美國國會的選舉，自然也更爲重要了。在美國國會內的上下兩院議員席位，數年來皆以民主黨佔多數，共和黨佔少數，此爲共和黨所欲力爭者，計民主黨議員五十六名，共和黨議員二十九名，進步派議員一名，（其中其他三十二名民主黨議員及二十八名共和黨議員，則不改選，故不受此次選舉影響）故共和黨如欲得勝，必須再有二十一名當選），此爲就上議員而論，下議員共四百三十五名，民主黨佔二百三十五名，共和黨佔一百九十二名，勞工黨一名，參加國會選舉者，計全國四十七省，緬省（Mslne）已於九月選舉，共的三千五百萬選民，同時選舉省長者計共有三十四省，在些三十四省省長中，民主黨省長佔十六省共和黨省長佔十四省，這是美國國會內及各省民主黨與共和黨勢力的分佈情形。</p>
<p>十一月五日的轟動世界的美國國會選舉，無疑的已經證明了共和黨于前進派的大勝利，結果造成了共和黨在第八十屆國會下院中得佔二百三十九席，而民主黨佔一百九十六席，此雖不足與一九三六年選舉時民主黨在下院佔三百三十四席，共和黨只佔八十九席相比，也不能與在一九二〇年的選舉共和黨大勝的結果下院佔三百席民主黨只一百三十二席並論，但在共和黨將二十年來未曾抬過頭的情形下比較起來，總算是共和黨大勝了。不過據筆者的觀察，這次共和黨的大勝，是前進派的共和黨，或稱之爲左派的共和黨得勝，因爲極右派的共和黨，仍是不爲人民所擁護的，原因很簡單，因爲這些人太自私，太趨向孤立主義，這些大資本家都是第一次歐戰因給政府承造軍火，藉世界大戰，發了財的，這些少數的極右派共和黨是不被人民擁護的。反之，共和黨的前進派，或稱左派，是人民所希望，能使民主黨而轉使執政的，我們硏究這次選舉，可發現如果說是共和黨的勝利，反不如說是民生黨的失敗。這次選舉充分證明了、人民因畏懼並痛恨共產黨及民主黨的前進派或稱左派——如華萊斯前副總統及商務部長，因爲民主黨近多年來，由於羅斯福給了工會的權柄太大，而使民主黨極左派與共產黨由携手而日漸共產黨大爲侵人政府及人民中間，道是人民視爲可怕的大事。人民由此引起了對政府不滿意。在戰時羅斯福時代，人民尙可忍耐，因顧全世界大局，不料近一二年來，勞工勢力並未削減，民主黨極左派仍與共產黨携手合作，杜魯門總統的制止不够利害，人民仍不滿意。華萊斯被　辭職，僅其一例，這些都是造成次共和黨勝利的大原因。</p>
<p>一貫國策　堅持羅氏政綱</p>
<p>有些人士，特別是共產黨方面分析這次選舉的結果，說是因爲杜魯門總統在內政外交上都違背了羅斯福政策的原故，這完全不合事實，因爲在他就任時，早聲明又要繼續羅斯　政策，這些人士又批評說：由於處處向共和黨與反動派的壓力讓步與投降，而逐漸背紫羅斯福的政綱，又說在外交上破壞了三强團結建立集體安全制的和平政策，推行了貝爾納斯與范登堡所謂兩黨一致之强硬反蘇聯的帝國主義原子彈金元外交政策。這些都正顚倒。事實的說明，因爲如果杜魯門總統向共和黨投降背棄羅斯福的政策，他不會被共和黨反對，他也更用不着迫華萊士部長辭職，他很可更加强的反對共和黨與共和黨不合作，在外交上，筆者覺得杜魯門沒有接受民主黨左派（前進派）一般人如華萊士親近共產黨的人的意見，反之，他是一個保守右派的民主黨政策，這個政策是很可與共和黨的左派（前進派）相合作——就是不贊成共產黨侵入美國人民及政府，不過在共和黨的左派反共黨的成分又積極些，與民主黨的右派對共黨的看法又有些不同，代表民主黨前進派的要人，除了華萊士以外，其他如國會上院議員（Claude）Pepper）與g　位喬治州長—（Coveronor　Arnall　of　Georgia），他們都是所謂民主黨的前進派自由主義者，殊不知已走向與人民意志大相反對的方向，難怪人民就連民主黨內的人也怕了他們，結果由於民主黨內的這種分裂現像，使共和黨選舉勝利，國際共產黨人，又說由於杜魯門總統向大工商業資本家投降破壞了美國經過統制而迅速恢復和平經濟，以防止通貨膨脹的健全辦法，其結果使民生困難，社會不安，經濟復員被妨碍，這些情形引起人民的不滿，共和黨乃利用人民道種情緒作種種好聽的對人民之諾言，所以許多選民中其計，而共和黨能致勝等批評，筆者深知美國民生困難的原由，通貨膨脹的原因完全是因政府仍繼續戰時物價統制，結果又在政府重稅政策之一，資本家即因物價統制所製造之物無利可圖，政府重稅政策未减，加上勞工不厭求多，罷工要求减少工作時間，增加工資，一個最普通的工人，可拿到每月二百五十元至四百餘元，有汽車可駕，還嫌不足，這樣工人因工會力量支持無往而不勝利工人達到了目的，社會上因購買力增加，通貨自然膨脹，平民只有呌苦，怨這些民主黨的所謂自由主義者的前進派與工會，合作的可惡，道才是人民道次要選共和黨的原因，—直接是給民主黨的前　　進派打擊，間接給工會與共和黨打擊。</p>
<p>民主黨的保守派或稱右派與共和黨的前進派，是非常的合作，在美南的民主黨領袖與議員，更是如此，這是共產黨目之爲民主黨的反動派，他們本來是要想領導政府走向適應環境的於人民有福利的途徑，這些在共黨視爲不對，他們認爲這些人破壞了羅斯福的政策是民主黨的糟粕，這實在是一件太不公平合理的批評，反之，他們認爲　萊士是民主黨的進步領袖，也唯有贊成華氏的主張才是對的，我們看美國人民竟畢是不糊邊的，不論任何黨，一離了正途，走入歧路，民衆馬上會分別出來，要不選舉他，要打倒他的，所以在選舉的最後階段，民主黨的所謂前進派—共產黨亦附和之，號爲自由主義人士，在芝加哥召開了一個大會，討論民主黨的進步派的行政綱領，華萊氏攻擊總統的外交政策—對蘇强硬政策，但是美國人民更懼怕民主黨的這些親共產黨的人士將來執政後，更是不得了，連民主黨的保守派人士也不能不承認，這不是民主黨之福，果然，選舉後民主黨敗北，工會雖然吃盡力量，用了千百萬金錢，但仍不免失敗，筆者對於民主黨的這些眞正好的候選人，因爲民主黨前進派受勞工，共黨的擁護，結果眞正的民主黨保守派的好人，受了連累，不能當選，認爲可惜，正是代人受過。</p>
<p>雖然如此，因爲勞工與民主黨的前進派共產黨密切的合作，花了大量的金錢與宣傳，幸而在紐的州美國勞工黨的前進派下議員馬見寸尼與鮑維爾當選速任，還有勞工代表薛貝爾與卡普蘭當選爲省議會上下議員，這是僅有的親共產議員，這幾個人當選，說是民意的當選，不如說是共和黨與人民的隣恤！</p>
<p>第三黨可能產生嗎？</p>
<p>由於民主黨的前進派，還有一些其他團體組織，雖然名之爲民主黨，但在事實上，早已另有主張，別具政見，現在有可能這幾個大力量滙合組成第三個黨的現象。在去年九月廿八日，有全國公民政治動委員會，產業工人協公政治行動委員會，藝術，圖學，職業獨立公民委員會等自由主義團體，在芝加哥開會，他們的共同目的爲尋求聯合力量的共同基礎。在那一决大會中，包括三十一州的代表，大會主席是前羅斯福總統時代之摩根索，大會之程序委員會則由前內政部長伊克斯指導，在那决大會中講話的人，主要的是上議員白波耳，下議員拉法葉諸人，他們的聲勢好像是相當的大，當芝加哥的這三個自由主義的團體閉幕以後，隨後在紐約的自由主義團體也召開了一個聯席會議，組織了一個「聯繫委員會」，這個委員會的民標，爲使全國各地的自由主義團體樹立一　共同政策的基礎，這一個聯席會議有許多委員是知名之士，如前財政部長　根索，產業工人協會主席麥瑞，該協會政治行動委員會主席克羅爾，全國公民政治行動委風會主席金登，全國律師協會主席　勒，紐約聯合銀行總經理李夏遜，南方人民福利會議主席福爾曼等，都是最重要的角色，其他參加該會有的雖然不是該會的發起人，但也熱烈參加的，有上議員白波耳與前物價統制局局長　爾斯，這許多有力人士多半是故羅斯　總統時代離開政府的要員。他們由這個運動又發起組織了一個七人委員會，負責審査可以參加該會的團體，據說有很多的美國勞工聯合會所屬的工會要求參加他們的運動，這七人委員會包括克羅爾，福爾曼，獨立工會鐵路工人兄弟會主席重特勒，全國有色人民進步委員會書記懷特，術，藝科學職業獨立公民委員會主席戴維孫，全國公民政治行動委員會副主席巴爾德溫，並有全國農民協會主席白登。這些人即不完全可說是民主黨的，但他們的主張却不的而同，例如華萊士的對外政策原子彈看法他們都擁護，他們說：「美國因繼續不斷製造原子彈，吾人之同盟國即發生疑心與不信任，唯有美國宣佈停止製造原子彈後，其他國家方能願共同聚集平等討論。他們對國內政策的主張；房租必須繼續統制，速建年大量房屋，以應急需。保障人民權利，擴大社會保險，重視勞工及退伍軍人福利，普及敎育，科學及藝術。改善農民生路，開發國家資源，扶助中小企羣，使租稅合理化等主臘，這個不可忽視的新政此治力量，無肄的是擁　故　　福政策力量的匯合，他們即不是共　　和寫，也不算民主黨，（　然　仍現在名　上是民主黨），他們本身是不廣大的政治運動，擁　這個運動約有中小資本家，自由職業者，工人與農人，這些擁護的人是代表美國大多數人民的利益，這個政治力量的前途，是不可不注意的。如果依　現在的發展與長成第三個大政黨，很可能在美國不久的將來會出現的。但如果他們走向共黨之途路，則必被人民所擯</p>
<p>今後美國內政</p>
<p>由於共和黨這次選舉勝利，我們可確定了美國今後對內政的趨勢。大槪推測，美國今後由於共和黨能操縱上下兩院的結果，第一個最顯著改革的，恐怕要算削減政府之在戰時羅斯福所定的重稅政策，第二個恐怕要削減工會權力，第三恐取消一切物價統制，第四積極推行自由貿易競爭，由於共和黨這次在谷州州長亦佔了多數，特別紐約州長杜威亦當選連任，這奠定了一九四八年共和黨又有推舉杜威任總統候選人的機會，一九四八年的總統選舉，在共和黨的現在眼光來看，那時必如一手索取囊中之物，是十分有把握的。不過還要看那時的政治環境有吾變更了。總之，這次的選舉，一方面共和黨爲出一口十五年來的悶氣，同時準備一九四八年的總統改選大事。這次選舉的意義，大部完全在內政方面，外交方面的意義不算十分大。茲申論之：</p>
<p>今後美國外交</p>
<p>共和黨這次得勢，決不是孤立主義的捲土重來，這是二十年來共和黨一個大的改變，如果有人慮及此點則大謬，更有人　及共和黨執政對於中國不利，那更是無稽之談，根本不將共和黨認識淸楚。不但現在，往遠看，就是一九四八年共和黨當選總統，如果共和黨內的保守派（或稱右派）要横行，必非人民所歡迎，反之，現在及未來只有共和黨的前進派才能得到人民的擁護，至於共和黨的保守派—孤立主義者是已被人民擯棄者數年，恐不易再起。</p>
<p>共和黨今後有一點値得世人特別注意的是對共產黨的蘇聨態度。據筆者看，祇有此貝爾納斯的政策加强，決不至於軟化。至於對蘇聯的巨大借款，更難以實現了，就是對於其他任何國家，至大數目借款，亦必愼重從事了，但對於美國友好的國家，也許例外，譬如英國，若是他有大的需要，就是美國的共和黨的國會或總統也會通過貸給的。中國是美國太平洋上的命定的朋友，隣居，美國有義不容辭帮助的道理，不過就看我們知道怎樣與這一個太平洋上旣仁慈又富強的朋友合作，在和平中建設一個近代化的新中國。總之，美國的援華政策，不但不至變動，反之也許更有利。對於蘇聯雖然不至強硬到任何地步，但決不至再容共黨擴張，因爲共和黨的保守派與前進派都是痛恨共產主義的。最後，筆者引證紐約省長杜威連任選舉成功後發表的談話，他說要用他最大的努力，消滅共產黨在紐約市與紐約州他的行政管轄區內的恐怖主義。</p>

<h3>憤怒的松花江　南北兩岸戰痕目擊記</h3>
<p>— 本報瀋陽記者趙展</p>
<p>松北一月卅日航訊</p>
<p>長春記者團廿餘人，昨天結隊到松花江去，去視察此次松北共軍竄擾經過之松花江南岸一片戰塲遺痕。新聞專車在零下三十二度的酷寒中出發。</p>
<p>抵德惠　晤張師長</p>
<p>車到德惠，我們會見印緬戰士之一的潘裕昆師長，在談話中，潘師長引述共軍的暴戾行爲，在記者的心頭散佈　上陰覺的暗影。共軍過云兩週據亂吉境，共暴行有兩端最著：第一是驅死赴死，據稱焦家嶺之役，雙方犧牲甚大，共軍圍攻國軍一團，激戰六畫夜，最慘烈之三天，共軍進攻時，或三十，或五十人，蜂擁而前，以致死屍堆積如山，死者大半是農民，如謂樸實的農民確甘心爲共軍拼死，誰也不敢相信，想必是共軍以强力爲之，此役戰死共軍屍體，以大車連送了七畫夜，聞者莫不酸鼻。</p>
<p>灌煤油　大焚枕木</p>
<p>其次，就是共軍對交通的慘烈破壞，德惠至松花江間的鐵道，節節加以破壞，枕木一根根都灌煤汕燒毁，電信桿倒在地上。此種破壞行爲，令人髮指！</p>
<p>由德惠而北，改乘吉普車云松花江邊，寒風迎面刺骨，極目漫漫雪野，大地如死一般寂靜，沿途所以見村莊，殘垣斷譬，不聞鷄犬，少見炊烟。偶見二三童子立道旁，倚墻角觀望，身上衣着單薄，光頭拖了兩條鼻涕。記者向他們招手，他們報以畏縮而狐疑的微笑。</p>
<p>崔縣長　談復員事</p>
<p>德惠縣長崔蘊蘭與我們同到松花江村。高齡的縣臨參會議長林桂山先生同來，此來的任務是辦理難民救濟事宜。同業們忙着周旋於軍方，縣太爺成了冷門，記者得便與崔縣長談了很久。他到任半年，感到地方復員十分艱鉅，建設趕不上破壞簡捷，德惠人口三十萬零三千八百六十人。難民有三萬人，無衣無食無家，共軍在機動游擊戰中，搶光了耕牛種子，明年春耕無望。春荒與死亡，已是展現在眼前的一幅慘痛圖畫。</p>
<p>老百姓　只剩褲子</p>
<p>崔縣長說：縣財政困難極了，財源靠田賦，而今年的田赋以原定額八折計算征收，也成了大問題，明年更沒有希望。窮愁之下，還不得不設法維持一筆龐大的保安經費。攤記者觀察：實際上，老百姓只利下一條褲子了。難民救濟，成了一個大問題。就松花江村一地　言，全村人十五戶，六百餘村民，都成了難民，從縣府領到的救濟糧僅兩担而已。崔縣長最後說：「我的志趣在於敎育，今年夏天一定可以做到一保一校，目前全縣中學一所，小學百餘個，就學兇童已達一萬七千餘人。」</p>
<p>莊稼人　確頭求鷄</p>
<p>刧後的一片死寂土地，正面臨着一個荒蕪的春天。記者記憶起德國詩人歌德那美麗的詩句和所包含的優越理論：「灰色，親愛的朋友，是整個的理論，綠色乃是美麗的生活之樹。」任何動人的宣傳，不能抹殺事實，人民會在經騐中體騐道理，在灰色的東北原野，誰是誰非，老百姓都知道。我們所担心的是綠色希望的遙遠。春天已經來了嗎？怎麽看不見大地的一片新綠？</p>
<p>共軍的政治戰略比以前略高一籌，在這次擾亂之中，沒有忘記收買人心，竭力討好於窮人，富農和商人都被淸算得一乾二凈，窮人反倒受些許小惠。記者走進一家農舍，襲稼老頭養了二十幾隻鷄，鷄屋窗上貼着「金鷄滿架」的紅紙條，是過年的表示。記者奇怪他的鷄沒有被搶走，老頭說：「你老，我靠鷄話命，是我磕了頭，把鷄要下來了。」</p>
<p>橋頭堡　屹立不動</p>
<p>記者由軍方引導參觀，松花江北岸的橋頭堡。在這次戰役中，橋頭堡的故事是很動人的。國軍兩排堅守了十一天沒有做攻破，彈痕斑斑的橋頭堡屹立在松花江北岸，是昨日戰役的最好見證人。它守衛的鐵橋已經再度被破壞了，據鐵路人員說：如再修復，需時一年，其破壞之慘烈可知。就松花江橋兩岸的地形看來，東岸比西岸低，西岸高地上的國軍火力，以居高臨下的態勢制壓共軍，江東是斜坡地，沒有大死角可資掩蔽，共軍只好在夜間潛入草範挖散兵坑了。</p>
<p>崔縣長指着頽然悄立着的墻壁說：松花江村是風長很好的地方，夏天很多人來此避署。記者所見，沒有一所完整的房子。有白俄在這裏居住着，據說一個白俄曾跪求共軍不燒他的房子。目前七十幾個白俄難民，羣趨長春去了。</p>
<p>儘管松花江村是殘破而寂寞，但當我們向它吿別時，實有依依不捨的心情，不斷地懷念着此地苦難的同胞們，他們的眼角上慘然地掛着淚痕。</p>
<h3>西安　冬去春來</h3>
<p>— 本報西安記者　李馳</p>
<p>華北老百姓劃分冬令的氣象頗合科學：以冬至爲開始，每九天作一段落，頭九天呌做「交九」，第十天到第十八天呌做「二九」，如此推算到「六九」的第一天恰是「立春」，「九九」的末後一天作爲冬令的完結。說冷，則以「三九」爲「最低頂點」，故諺語有「三九三，凍破磚」的說法。這一冬老天公特別幫忙窮人，今天是一四九」的頭一天了，而冷得最厲害的日子還沒到來。老天爺好　明知官兒們做事繼喜歡拖拖延延，不過是六千萬元的冬令賬款吧了，一拖拖到「四九」才發放，幸喜「三九」沒有「凍般磚」，不然，冥冥地府裏不知新添多少議寒鬼！</p>
<p>調査，登記，覆査，塡了表又塡了册，掠了指模又蓋上官印。每個難民可以領到幾許呢？大口發四千元，小口發兩千元，一次過，本來計劃發兩次了也打個對折了。四千元剛好買一袋麵粉的十分之一，兩千元買不到兩個饅頭。計劃說準備救濟兩萬人，而調査到的遠不及此數，若然眞是窮人少了麽，那最好不過；但若有窮人而塡不上册，那祇好吃西北風，反正窮鬼死了，活該！救濟救濟，點綴點綴，循例循例！</p>
<p>「乞丐」這字眼不好看，好吧，呌做「游民感化所」。所裏的被收容者每日伙食費五百大元正，這幾天才添到八百，吃得够半飽麽？那又祗有天曉得。可惜應受「感化」的「游民」多屬「賤骨頭」，在「所」不受「感化」面「潛逃」出去，何等「有碍市容」。不過，平心而言，市政之辱並不限於饑寒交迫的大小呌化。</p>
<p>同是一張鈔票，財主給餓鬼日「施捨」，窮人給老闆曰「獻呈」。西安人在直淋淋生活中也學會「幽默感」了，眼看一袋麵粉依然四十斤，經過「評價委員會」在上月中旬的十天之內調整兩次，每袋由兩萬五的限價「限」到三萬五，黑市更瘋狂地突破四萬，難怪人們說：這不是「限價」，而是「默價」，因爲新價公佈時比市價還高。這不是「獻」是什麽？</p>
<p>其時有一段插曲：律師張恒忻在除夕前向地方法院具狀檢舉麵粉商，爲市民民食請命。法院隨即派出法警前往磨粉廠封訂賬簿，以備日後査對。粉廠對付得够硬，他們停止磨粉，同時並由麵粉業產業工會出面，說張律師「摧殘工人生活』，『摧殘工業」，應予「依法懲辦」！又說：賬尋被封了開不了工，然而這種歪曲的理由抵不住法院嚴正的聲明。現在早就復工了，賬簿還在封存中。</p>
<p>在這一段插曲中，我們看又到了「神通廣大」的「麵粉攻勢」，平素號稱「人民喉舌」的這回被麵粉點得喉塞舌結了。和洋錢一樣白的麵粉還塗白了好些人的鼻尖，該說話的人不說話，在說話的人却說出不該說的話。扣封賬簿本是件小事，但偏偏有人拉上和共產黨的「淸算」挪在一起，說是「大忤逆」！（那末，誰是「大忠大孝」呢？）</p>
<p>張恒圻氏同時又是本市參議員，本月中旬的市參會一屆四决犬會中，有人預料這件事情起碼也會給吃貴麵的旁聽者和市民們「痛快」一下，然而事實上並不，議塲中不過循例的提及一下，就「紀錄在卷」，「按下慢表」，無結果；會中地檢院長也沒有明顯的表示有什麽辨法，如何法辦。</p>
<p>無怪乎事情當初發生，就有人預測到這不過像個「茶杯裏的風波』，「麵粉袋裏的風波」吧了。試點點名字，且看那幾家麵粉廠的股東，董事，監理事之類的名單上，有無「新聞人物」，亦官亦商！</p>
<p>另據省參議會駐會委員會表亦。本市麵粉屢次漲價，影響民生至鉅，該會迭有決議分送各報發表，尙有報社未予刊登，殊屬遺憾！</p>
<p>市參戲會檢舉市府軍事科長羅楚凡和第二區區長張吉安之互相勾結，串同貪汚，正是會中最動人的一件事。會塲上參議員把　科長問得他理竭辭窮，並且議決將張吉安立予扣押，但市長表示祇能停職査辦，雙重舖保，隨傳隨到。他們的被控吿項目計有尅扣壯丁安家費及征集費，額外徴交壯丁，扣發建築機塲民工資及茶水費，……等，事　的眞相，還在追査中，聽說市府曾開過一次秘密會議，檢討此事；軍管區師令部，亦密切注意此事的發展，這或許要牽及意想不到的範圍更廣的人物；此外亦有人透露說責在問題並不在張吉安這一個人身上。</p>
<p>這件有關乎行政的大事情，想不能也「有首無尾」以「不了了之」吧。</p>
<p>會塲中某參議員質問：「在新兵徴集所內，壯丁日夜聚賭，主持人袖頭；壯丁病者多，死的也有……」。這樣作爲，够人「不寒而慄」！</p>
<p>「守法奉公」的公敎人員似乎命中註定了要捱寒抵飢。上月公佈的調整新待遇、此間雖中央直屬機關，有些至今未能實行；省級的直到現在才能補發。市級的更不用說，一個市府的優員每月領到的薪金，扣除了麵粉代價以後，剩下的不過區區幾千元，凑不足一張最近發行的五百元關金新鈔！</p>
<p>西北大學和西北工學院敎授們一再呼籲，請求改善待遇，並且議決如不獲圖滿解決，預定十六日懶敎。十四日接到敎部覆電，說「正呈行政院力爭中」，敎授們爲顧全學生學業，暫時維持繼續授課。餓着肚子的母牛究竟可以榨出多少乳汁，可以再榨多少時間呢？</p>
<p>實際上，有數字可作憑證，即使按照十二月份新待遇支薪，公敎人負的生活依然十分艱苦。因爲此間的物價已經遠超京滬地帶，但西安區的待遇反而列入第三級。本月初，中央直屬的駐陜機關十七個單位曾聯名電請改　，援照京滬例列爲第一級，但至今尙未有下文。</p>
<p>結底歸根，我們就毫不意外的看到晋陜監察使署鼓表卅五年度受理案件統計中如下的數字：在一千七百九十多件案子中，以屬於控訴貪汚擬派受賄者爲最多。這是一個「說明」也是一個不可避免的「結論」。（一月三十日）</p>

<h3>「遙遠的愛」是一塊紀程碑</h3>
<p>— 葉以羣</p>
<p>我常常有一種私見，覺得國產電影的水準，一直落在話劇之後，不單是內容方面如此，即形式方面也是如此的，新近看了「遙遠的愛」的試片，却將我這成見打破了。我覺得「爾遠的愛」是繼承了二十年來新演劇的優良傳統，而又發展了牠；同時，又發揮了電影所特有的優長，因此，它才能表現那麼長的時間（的十四五年）和那麼廣的空間（上海，武漢·桂林）中的現實的發展。那種經濟，扼要，而又鮮明之手法，是話劇所不可及的；而它對於現實的認識和表現的深度，又遠遠地超過了過去的國產影片。所以，我們如果說它是新電影的一塊醒且的記程碑，大槪並非過分的。</p>
<p>它以蕭元煦和余珍的結合與分離過程爲經，而以數時代的波濤起伏（九一八·八一三·武漢棄守·桂林撤退）爲　。在這經緯交錯之中，表現出了勞動婦女進步和善於幻想的智識分子後退的歷程，而住將各時代羣衆的動向也插畫得相當明朗。這收獲確是可貴的。</p>
<p>也許有人會覺得它把智識分子批判得太刻薄，未免有失公平。然而，我們不可忘記；它批判的祗不過是智識分子的一種類型，而並非智識分子全體。李練羣不就是一個上進智識分子的側影嗎？</p>
<p>取景的適當和攝影的優美也創造了國產電影的新紀錄。總之，這確是繼「漁光曲」，「桃李刧」，「十字街頭一等而發展起來的電影藝術的新收獲；而且也是找到了中國電影藝術的正路的。</p>
<h3>評「遙遠的愛」</h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾祺</p>
<p>「人不能不受環境的影響，不能適應環境的人必須要經過改造。」遙遠的愛就是根據着這一點發展。</p>
<p>大學敎授蕭元熙（趙丹飾）是一個心理學家，他的性格很誇張，自信力也很强，他的人生觀就是想用他的思想來改造別人，因此，他想把家裏的一個鄕下大姐（秦怡飾）改造成一個現代化的女性，這個計劃結果是成功了，無知的鄕下姑娘變成了麾登小姐，而且做了蕭敎授的夫人；但是她受了敎育的薰陶，發現了蕭敎授僅僅是一個理論家，不能適合潮流，他滿口是反對封建，但是却希望她成爲一個封建思想下的家庭女性，當然，一個眞正的現代女性是不甘受這些束縛的，她知道怎樣去迎合一個大時代，掙扎脫了環境的束縛，投身給苦難中國的懷抱，將愛獻給無數的受苦同胞，最後，蕭教授感動了，他懂得了愛的眞諦。</p>
<p>看完了「遙遠的愛」，我欽佩劇作者對於人物性格的創造，銀幕上的蕭敎授，他炫耀着自己，賣弄着本領，堅持着成見，善於指摘別人不能適應環境，但是却不善責備自己，其實他本身的思想也需要加以改造，終於，在桂林逃亡的途中，他遭受到了種種的苦難：赤足涉水，領取賑食，稻草取暖，沒有苦難的磨折又怎樣使他幡然覺悟呢？於是，他感到了互助的偉大，他懂得了遙遠的愛的眞義，劇作者的指示正是這一點。</p>
<p>肅敎授與夫人兩種性格的轉變，是很難在銀幕上表演得討好的，但導演手法高妙，協助演員克服了這種困難，像鄕下姑娘余珍的轉變，在她的頭髮上可以看出：女傭的時代梳一根大辮；在敎授改造她時，已經易爲兩根小辮了，顯示出她對於修飾方面巳漸注意；以造完成後，她完全成爲了一個都市女性，　髪已燙，充分表現出她愛美的天性；最後，部她參加了婦女工作。頭髮又回復至極其樸實的形式，除了這些據得了最大的戲劇效果外，銀幕上還有很多美麗動人的畫面和有趣活潑的鏡頭：像蕭敎授途中遇　欲言還停的神氣，是他一生行程中的轉捩點；大飯店中一餐與逃難時的吞餅也是一個强烈的對照；路中日兵的行列是以後中日戰事爆發的呼應；還有余珍的赤足履草鞋與蕭敎授的脫去皮鞋而赤足，也是極有意義的比較。不過，小疵未免沒有，像片首蕭敎授的公開演講時，一女聽客的搽脂擦粉拍手呌好的幾個鏡頭，似乎於理欠通；穿插曼麗的一段似乎多餘；敎授上課時的幾幕也似乎不近現實。</p>
<p>演員中，趙丹所飾的蕭敎授與秦怡所飾的余珍，刻劃出兩種不同的性格是獲得最大的成功：蕭敎授的談吐汕滑不着邊際與落魄無言時的舉動遲鈍描繪出一幅活的畫面；余珍的喪父死兄亡兒。哀慟咽泣與以後的擔任救護工作，顯示出偉大的愛，都能吸住觀衆們的情緒。</p>
<p>錄音大約因物質環境限制不如理想，但希望它能不斷改進。</p>
<p>我推薦本片。</p>
<h3>却爾斯維多談　麗泰海華絲</h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>哥倫比亞公司名導演却爾斯維多，「一曲難忘」就是他最成功的作品，這裏是他對記者的一席談話，關於麗泰海華絲的：</p>
<p>我崇讚着麗泰是最美麗。最甜畫，最有天才的一個女明星，過去我們會合作了三决，第一次是在一九四〇年的「神秘小姐」中，還有是「封面女郞」及「姬黛」二片，假如公司當局允准的話，我希望能再與她合作三十次。因爲她眞像一個馴服的嬰孩，演戲的時候，她永不遲到，工作極認眞，不會在十一點鐘請求你允許她出去進餐或在四點鐘要離開攝影塲呀！不過當她不如意時，也會很憤怒而頓足；然而我可以說在工作時間外這種情形也時常容易發生的，這理由是：「做電影明星的生活畢竟是十分辛勞，試想一個女孩子，在淸晨六時就得起身，七時化駐，自九時起至天黑整天的工作，缺少精神上的安慰，物質上的享受，她能忍受得住嗎？」所以麗泰有時內心極痛苦而易傷感情的，因此她的婚事亦常變幻莫測，當「神秘小姐」開拍時，她與埃迪裘特蓀宣吿離異，「封面女郞」開攝時她剛和奧遜威爾士結合。</p>
<p>然在「姬黛」攝製過程中，一個早晨她沒有到公司來工作，我料想一定有意外的事情了，因爲她從不無故缺席的，果然在那天晚上，她與奧遜離婚的消息傳遍了整個影城，但在第二天她還照常到公司來工作，她的面色並沒顯得灰白，眼睛裏並沒有淚水在在地，一切都保持得和尋常一樣。攝影塲上工作人員都詫具地說：「這是什麽回事啊？」關於這件事她沒有吿訴我，我也根本不知道，這是一個謎，永遠是一個謎。不過我倒可以代她聲明，當時她的確沒有一「膩友」的。</p>
<p>現在影迷們都關心着她再會同別人結婚嗎？她自己說「不」，據我的推想，她仍需要這異性的安慰的，因爲她是感到孤單，寂寞，不過你又得問：「她能不能再找尋到一個合意的人呢？」對於這一層，我當然亦不能肯定地回答，但我涌望她總够。麗泰的確也能做一個賢慧的妻子，仁慈的母親，祗要做丈夫者瞭解她的性情的話。</p>
<h3>史林</h3>
<p>— 江鳥</p>
<p>史林，在上海舞台上已經和觀衆見了幾次面，但是觀衆不一定能注意她，因爲她在舞台上所扮演的角色，並不是年輕的女郞，而是演四五十歲的老太太，但她的演技是够爐火純靑的。最近在「女人與和平」中，她演婦女會長，從她的外形上看，也够看出她對劇中人的性格了解的程度了。</p>
<p>在「女人與和平」中，好像從封建到現代，（在服裝上和演技上都能够看上）史林在前半的服裝是長袍，長圍巾，在後半是摩登女性的服飾，在這兩個外形的介紹上，加上她自己的演技和她本身的修養和認識，把這性格介紹得非常淸楚。就只要看她的攏着衣袖，和坐在橋頭看書的神情已經够了。雖然這性格是無定型的，但她仍能够把她介紹淸楚，已經是不容易的了。</p>
<p>她是北平美專的畢業生，對藝術有相當的條養，對話劇的認識也因此有了深刻的瞭解。她自離開北平後，就到重慶加入話劇的陣營。在重慶的舞台上，素負盛名，爲一般觀衆所歡迎的女演員。但她並不因此滿足，也並不因此而覺得自滿，照她自己的言語：她還是在學習，朋友和觀衆的指責和批評，都是她最好的引導。她很虛心地接受大家的意見，從這些謙虛的態度上，我們就可以知道她是一個了不起的女演員。</p>
<p>她是一個富有男性美的女性，性情豪爽，體格健美。當你在路上看到她的時候，決不是一個溫柔的賢妻良母型的女郞，而是一個說一是一的爽快的姑娘。</p>
<h3>同情與憎恨看「八千里路雲和月」</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>一八千里路雲和月」是描寫一羣愛好藝術的靑年男女，以戲劇形式作爲抗敵武器，在前綫和後方發揮着他們的作戰力量。這一個演劇隊，在八年的抗戰期中，受盡了風霜雨雪，嚐盡了生活上的艱難困苦，所得到的報酬是一聯串的不幸，只是對自己的良心有着無限的慰藉。</p>
<p>劇中男女主角高禮彬和江玲玉，自抗戰開始就參加了這演劇隊，直到勝利後才離隊回家，可是家沒有了，他們只能暫時寄居在親戚家里，爲了看不慣這一家子的糜爛生活，才搬到了一層擱樓似的小屋子里去住，生活是極端的窮困。江玲玉懷着孕深夜工作，因爲平常缺乏營養，使自己的體力無法支持這沈重的工作而暈倒在路旁，若不是這一羣演劇隊的朋友，她是會被醫院抬出來的。</p>
<p>可是，和他們相反的，是江玲玉的表哥，一個投機取巧的，只想做官發財的混蛋傢伙。人家在爲了抗戰受苦，他却囤積居奇地發國難財，過着花天酒地醉生夢死的生活。勝利後，居然能坐着飛機復員，一變爲接收人員，仗勢　佔寡婦的房屋，再轉頂給別人，自己從中撈金條。這種旣卑鄙又無恥的人，却住着高大的洋樓，過着一呼百諾的日子。並且是那麼的太平無事，怎不呌人氣憤呢！</p>
<p>現在的社會，就是這樣的黑暗。終日辛勞，不投機取巧的人，過的是饑餓寒冷的苦生活；幹着損人利已，不顧廉恥的人，反而能坐汽車，住洋房。好像這社會是鼓勵人們去多多地做這種不法的事情似的。否則，爲什麼這樣的壞蛋也能生存在這社會里呢？</p>
<p>「八千里路雲和月」給我們的，就是這正反兩面的事實。編導人沒有替這些人物加上一條「善有善報，惡有惡報」的因果尾巴，不知觀衆是否會想到：同情與憎恨，該如何地付出去。我以爲：貪官汚吏和奸商們是會讚美着江玲玉的表哥，而恥笑着另一對傻瓜的！</p>
<h3>新片漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>自君別後</p>
<p>可憐太平洋畔骨，猶是深鬥夢裏人。冬天的雨雪輕輕的落着，屋裏主人不再歸來，一個抽咽的女人的世界。「軍人魂」揭示戰士們的眞生命，這裏卻是稀稀疏疏冷冷淸淸的戰士們的家庭，沒有砲火的後方，美國人眼中的現實。這裏的女人沒有一道河，隔開距離，她們怵憬着全人類的憧憬，愛情和生命。誰忘了那平靜的天下？無邊的曠野，一對小小的人影向前奔跑，歌聲追着浮雲，前途無限似地，糧倉避雨，情意綿綿，只一瞬一切都空了。自君去後，廳堂也是那麼着條。</p>
<p>導演的翰克朋威爾，歷史悠久。「頑童小傳，」「三劍客，」「盧宮秘史，」「海角遊魂，」是其傑作。他自視「自君別後」是他年來代表作。一九四四年十大巨片他就推薦這張片子。他的導演技巧非常詳細，開端的空位子，烟斗，男人用具，琪恩與男友在飲食店食東西，男子三次回來取物，叙事詳盡，無一遺漏。但總括起來約翰克朗威爾的手法，不及茂文李洛埃的簡潔。「自君別後」是張題材優秀的片子，可是太長了，有的地方略嫌煩悶，太詳細的時候便覺多餘，大可省去。不能緊凑遂成缺點。譬如黑奴僕替琪恩蓋被好苜相慰，老上校和小妹妹耕種花草，母女乘火車探詢消息，等寺，都是節外生枝，多此一舉。哭泣塲面，翻三覆四，反而不覺哀婉，其實繪出梧桐更兼細雨，就够煩愁了。因此，論功力「自君別後」較之同意味的「人類的喜劇」來得遜色。本片配音値得一提，祈禱時的「聖母頌」，抵家時的「安樂家」，傷兵床前歌唱的南部民謠，安排得很眞切。</p>
<p>演員可謂天造地設，陣容可愛。薛爾齊尼克的調度一向妥貼，各人適合個性，演來好像未曾費力。克勞黛老爾白年來的成績，證明她不單是個喜劇演員，結尾聽電話一節表情的變化和在歡舞，因其拿手本事，我對她有很深的信任。琪妮佛瓊絲曾膺一九四三年金像獎，扮少女懷春，頗爲純眞。她說克勞黛的眼睛是好萊塢女星中最美者，令我不解。約瑟夫考登平穩。秀蘭鄧波兒和「重逢有日」差不多。勞勃華爾克隨直有趣，這裏比「居禮夫人」的助手來得特出。</p>
<p>羣雛戲鳳</p>
<p>戀愛策略上，假痴假呆似是要訣。佯作孩子引得對手心旌意動，總操左券。同樣是扮兒戲戲弄男子，因有「男女之間」的誇張在先，我們讚譽狄安娜巴里摩亞的喜笑怒屬，亨利柯斯脫導演的鬧劇哄堂大笑，「羣雛戲鳳」便覺平淡。導演比利韋爾特也算有名。羣兒大事追求的醜態百出。可惜舞會中拔髮人未加利川，製造笑料，只是一排別出心裁的背景而已。</p>
<p>逑羅吉絲演技原來不弱，安詳，秀逸·這眞分飾三個時期，一樣合度，眞是老少咸宜。可是她沒有穿甚麼稱身的新裝，不像狄安娜巴里摩亞那樣時時顯出自己。雷密倫沒有勞勃孔敏士的發揮機會，不曾上琴逑羅吉絲所飾蘇珊的大當，亦未大食苦頭，甚至無法裝尶尬面孔。惟有飾未婚妻之妹的狄安娜林，當時只有十六歲，倒是從此建立了她演劇的基點。</p>
<p>居禮夫人</p>
<p>天上有更多的星星，是的，居禮夫人老恩師的話說對了，是那些眞理的星星在暗夜裏閃耀。那一星光芒，居禮夫人找到了，是錯錠，是愛情的光輝。淅瀝細雨中，撑傘而去，一柄傘下有他們永恒的世界。茂文李洛埃佈置的溫柔，他沿用他精繳的抒情手法，絲絲入扣，寫出愛情的價値，可以創造如何的偉大。居禮夫人不是奇人，只是一個深悉愛情力量的女人。求婚和蜜月旅行有人生輕鬆的旋律，戀之懷抱中一切勇氣和毅力都可復生，四十餘决的失敗在所不計。居禮的死，也是爲了妻子的一顆飾物，愛的象徴。噩耗降臨的一塲，叩門聲以後的一串沉默，是暴風雨前的靜止，無形的高潮，居禮夫人走到門口，沉痛的臉色，雷霆萬鈞打擊下來了，檢視遺物以後，依門號哭，凄厲撼人，和求婚前門隙的步伐兩塲，處置絕佳。</p>
<p>葛麗亞嘉蓀係代嘉賽演這個角色，我柑信嘉寳恐無她的沉着。華德畢爾金的居禮，維妙維肖，生動恰到好處，充分發揮了他的才能，飾助手的勞勃華嘉，和飾新聞記者的范喬生，常時還是初出茅廬，如今都成名了。</p>

<h3>弘一大師的書法</h3>
<p>— 陳祥耀</p>
<p>法師早年臨舟墨濱，人莫不知其能得古人之神髓；近代獨創一格之法書，人亦莫不知其有不食人間烟火氣象；然能深刻體會，確知其功夫苦切處，確知其精神結集處，則未多見。法師在世所創書體之演進，吾從其作品上觀察，似有三階段在：其初由碑學脫化而來，體勢較矮，肉較多；其後肉漸减，氣漸收，力漸凝，雙成較方較楷的一派二數年來結構乃由方楷而變為修長，骨肉由飽滿而變為瘦硬，氣韻由沈雄而變為淸拔，冶成其憂獨造的整個人格的表現的歸眞返欉超塵入妙的審境。其不可及處，乃在筆筆氣舒，筆筆鋒藏，筆筆神歛，寫這種字，必先把全副精神，集於心中，然後運之於腕，貫之於筆，傳之於紙，其發於心也，為心澄，為神住！故其作為字也，有一種飲神藏鋒之氣韻，心正筆正，此之謂矣，與信手揮灑，解衣磅礴者，又自不同也。有法師之人品，有法師心靈修養工夫，有法師審畫天才，故有法師那種淸氣流行，綫條俊蕩之書法。此蓋自個人平日體會揣摩之所得言。若以個人前年所費兩星期臨摹法師的書法的知難而退的經騐論：則法師之字，最難寫是每筆收筆的一剎那，收筆時能够學得到法師之歛神藏鋒工夫者，其人可謂得此道三昧矣。</p>
<p>總之，其氣韻之生動，在綫條之優蕩；綫條之優蕩，在氣力運轉之得宜；氣力之運動，在心靈靜定之有方；由靜心而運氣，而行筆，而綫條俊蕩，而氣韻生動，而精神顯露；字之精神，即出於人之精神也。故不能學其用心而欲學其用筆者，終從費其學也。法師所寫「佛」字，其綫條更生勤得有韌性，我用「韌」字來形容，大家也許疑為生疏。夫古人之見鬥蛇而草法火進者何耶？蓋蛇一鬥則頭頸問力量所運之處，一伸一縮，胥為綫條活動的表現，胥為機條氣韻的表現，胥為綫條　性的表現，法師老年書法，根脈愈來愈韌，愈有柔而堅之力量，尤不徒為吾所論之骨淸神透已矣。是亦夕陽絢爛黃錯最好之一徵象也。</p>
<h3>紀漸江的遺畫</h3>
<p>— 梁烈亞</p>
<p>漸江上人俗姓方名鞱，字六奇　名弘仁，人稱梅花古衲，是明木的遺民，與同里查梅　汪無端孫無逸，稱為兩梅二無，同為新安四大家，又與桐城方以智釋名弘智（為明季四公子之一）稱釋家南北兩弘，弘仁是黃山寫生之　手，他的盡筆清秀疏勁，簡遠靈虛，學倪而不畫倪，習米而變米，是以能超說古人，自成風格，為四大家和兩弘之冠；又為明李至今筆黑最靈秀的書人。可惜他的遺　傳，委實是太少了！</p>
<p>昨讀本權所載許士騏先生的「皖南行脚」說；「梅花古衲墓道，兩旁徧植梅花數十本，兼句後，當於冰肌玉骨山見其冷　孤芳之姿，為名山點綴，再上有漸江上人墓，漸江係一代新安　手，以細華工寫黃山，　標風格、冠絕一時惜傳世之作甚少，求訊邑人不可得，」知道許先生此次回里，對於其故鄉先貴手澤，深具　崇和尋求之呈意，並以在故鄉當地尙不可得見為恨。</p>
<p>但是我却在抗日時期（三十四年五月）作客於　州城外唐模鄉許疑庵老先生（疑會號董　，名承曉，淸李翰林，善書篆隷，會長廿　民政，　修安徽首甚，長於詩詞考據之學，收廠古板書　敦書煌畫甚富，與章太炎張奉直寫文草知交）之疑寇裏，曾得欣賞疑　老人所减的漸江上人遺車兩件，精潔完整，極為罕貴，可為　藝之師本。</p>
<p>一，是蟯江風便圖卷，長約五尺高約六寸，上人在卷裏自題云：「辛丑十一月，伯炎居士將儗廣陵之裝，其友人生洲居士吳義山作序學人寫曉江風便圖以贈」。卷尾有許楚題云，「癸卯立秋，新　　曉起，展卷靜心，試郡青丘暴，挼此　　　」。其後更有有議和尙題句：「筆　高秀，自雲林以後罕傳，漸公得之一變，諸公學雲林而實學漸公，公住海黃山，得黃山之眞性情，即一木一石靑黃山本色，風骨冷然生活，今無復能者！丙子春過邦上晤　人先生，出此卷供拜，各元生超古鑒賞之士，又不下伯炎美！淸　啤尊者原濟識」。我賞　此卷以後。覺得漸江遠近山水，船亭樹木，均用細勁完整之筆，寫成晨曉風和之景趣，靈秀情潔，無塵可人，令人感到人生還有一種更高的思想。所以我又對於看壽說是漸公什卷係得之雲林一變之旬，認為能眞賞者，才能有此透切的傾倒語，亦惟有眞本　才能得此美譽。而且米氏雲山不用濕紙必用濕筆，渲染以成，漸江乃用乾紙淨筆　抹而就，是以能清秀完整，風致國雅，旣超三林又脫米氏，自成一格一家。</p>
<p>二，是溙畫的屏風，高的六尺國的四尺，先塗以白漆為底，上人就在白漆上面再用色　　一老松，枝　撐橫，松針疏簡，意趣盎然，油漆顏色至今不改。近觀遠視均覺那株松的靈魂活着一般。款題「漸江學人為前左居士寫」，下圖大印二方，一為「漸江畫印」，二為「雲阭近人」，均用紅溙塡成，字體古秀。觀此漆畫可知我國繪畫，不獨是用毛筆和用壨用紙，亦有用漆用淀用木用火用刀用布用絹用綢用絲用木葉菓壳用石用瓦用磁用骨用竹用泥用　用金銀銅鎮錫水彩等等物具，來繪畫刻畫塑畫的，甚至用指及指田舌頭等等去繪畫。惜後人不肯研究古人遺留的藝術而再求上進，所以現時尙有許多人，以用筆紙絹畫成之畫，日國畫，用布漆水彩繪成之圖畫，日洋畫，似乎有些少淺薄和頑固罷！</p>
<h3>滕白也指畫贊</h3>
<p>— 陳孝威</p>
<p>昔楊患之與吳道子同師法張僧絲習繪事，惠之自知學力不能與道子爭勝，乃退而改習塑像，各著盛名！由是可知繪事之與離塑，其藝術息息相通，初無一致焉。</p>
<p>指畫專家膝白也先生，原名圭，為江蘇奉賢縣世家。曾漫游歐洲，專攻雕塑，旁及繪畫。疊年旅學歐洲時，對於法蘭西，意大利等國之歷史名刻，悉心觀摩，因得彼邦雕塑藝術之神隨。返國以後，迭主南北各大學各專門學校美發講座，并為革命元勳，當代賢哲，塑　銅石造偈，神態畢肖。而尤以戰前在京應徽塑造國父遺像，獲膺首選，惜造像工程，因二十六年戰事突發而停頓，此並世傑作，不擭與全國人士相見，誠屬憾事！</p>
<p>抗戰八年，滕君　轉大後方，往來於桂林，重慶，成都之間。旅程所歷，飽覽西南各省雄偉秀拔之好山水，陶中塊壘，益形嶔奇！滕君原工指畫，特在戰前，偶於茶餘酒後，興會淋漓時，為朋好所嬲，即席偶為，游戲三昧而已，乃滕君在抗戰期問，目覩敵寇猖狂，將士浴血，其胸中不平之氣，用以託諸指畫，其藝乃大進！</p>
<p>溯我國指畫鼻祖，羣輙以鐵嶺高其佩為圭臬。特高氏所作，固屬粗豪獷放可喜；究失諸絕賴，對於畫中神頒，不無稍遜。蓋高為北人，非國畫中之南宗，譬諸美婦，北地胭服，定較南朝金粉為遜色焉。　君所以作指畫，　在山水，人物，花鳥，蟲魚，無一不工，更無一不神態宛然！其指賓山水，有類石濤，并易草率為工致；人物綫條，師事佾縣壁繪，頗平艷可愛；花卉會魚，則其造詣追越青　白陽筆繪之上，而使紙上之動植物，咸具生機，栩相然活雙通熙倫矣！</p>
<p>去歲之秋，滕君歸自一四南，行　所藏，盡屬指畫，不啻將大技方之天然景色，載以俱來。經滬上友好之從恿，公開脹覽；設非八年抗職，膝君指畫之造詣，必無如此之洋洋大觀也。謬讀數言，藉資紹介。</p>

<h3>西洋畫史上的寫實精神　十九世紀法國畫風</h3>
<p>— 沈雁</p>
<p>十九世紀初葉的法國風景畫，可舉彌歇爾為其代表作家，在他的作風變遷中，可以感覺到當時風景畫之推移。</p>
<p>如將彌歇爾之風景畫，按年代排別起來，大的可分為三個時期。第一期為暗中摸素時代，服從荷蘭風景畫傳統。第二期為受到英國畫家影饗，允受康斯特普爾作風之刺激。第三期以自然的平易寫生為主，寫實性漸趨濃厚。</p>
<p>以十九世紀中葉為中心，其前後時代，為古典派與浪漫派對立，寫實派勃興。法國畫界便展開複雜的時期；所以以忠實的感情接近自然的風景畫家作品中，亦未免反映此種時代性格。他們一面將樹木詩化，將森林的神秘象徵化；而在另一而則畫出古代廢址或農民姿態，具有兩重性格。</p>
<p>在當時的法國畫風景畫的作家相當多，惟其中有顯著特色之畫家為下列四人，克羅，魯澀，托羅歪央以及米勒。此四人各有各的風格。因此研究此項作家特徵則可知當時風景畫的作風。惟此四人為作家的藝術價値　社會間議則各異。</p>
<p>在新的一批風景畫家中，特別傑出的就是克羅。他開始學畫的時候，正是法國傳統的理想風量畫家，佔居指導地位，其保守傾向甚至不承認不以古代廢墟為點綴的作品。克羅旅遊義大利，他的初期代表作為配合古典時代競技塲的寫生實等，即可證實此種傾向。惟此寫生古代競技塲的作品「克里饗」，在其簡單樸素的寫生傾向意義上，有可注目的價値　。蓋克羅終以此種寫生風格貫澈其很長的一生。</p>
<p>克羅晚年的作品為「社衛之鐘樓」即（畫出由杜衛街上看到的鐘樓）．其寫生精神，與年靑時毫無變化，惟其繪畫技巧則比年靑時更為熟練圓滿。頗與他穢一代的印象派畫家初期作品接近</p>
<p>克羅尊重色調及素描，以求　和的全體效果。並愛好透明而輕妙的諸律。如透明澄淸的水邊顫動於柔靜　律的樹蔭，太陽入西時的森林，站在湖沿勞的少婦等等簡素的叙情詩中，我們可以感到他獨特的寫生風格。他的畫決未沉醉於文學的感傷，亦未墮入形式主義。其作始終新鮮而滿溢生氣，此皆為克羅寫實精神所以產生的藝術生命。</p>
<p>克羅的畫如可稱為「樹木抒情詩」，則魯澀的作品應稱為「樹木的叙事詩」。他好羣喬木的壯大景緻，以樹木當英雄看待，此一點有魯　羅曼啻克性，惟其作品亦貫流寫生精神。</p>
<p>托羅歪盎為繼承荷蘭田園風景畫的專畫牲畜畫家。他畫的牲畜與自然環境相配合頗為生動。我們如到法國近郊一遊，常為其耕牛之夫麗而感　不已，托羅歪盎所畫出的田園多為此種景色。</p>
<p>米勒較上述三人則有顯著不同的性格。以個人關係而論，米勒應屬於上述一批人物之中，惟以藝術思潮分類，法國繪實史上的各作家，則米勒應屬於另一系統。他為以一八四八年二月革命為中心，徵出勞働階級生活環境的畫家中的一人，應與杜社米愛庫魯培等作家並論。但在此處需以寫實性觀點考察風景畫家，故暫根據米勒個人關係略述與三人風景畫家的關係。他開始畫農民畫為一八四八年以後，自在這一年的沙龍山品一部農民畫以後，他就一泰子專門書此種主題，他的作品如以技巧而論，頗帶外行氣味，並缺少力量；以複製的照片而論，似相當優越。惟在魯夫爾美術館與當代傑作一比較，則又相當遜色。然而他的歷史意義之所以以如此被重視，則因為他是最初的以沛民本身立塲畫出沛民生活環境的代表作家；同時亦代表在勸働階級中覓求主題的時代思潮。</p>
<h3>追念弘一大師</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>劉質平最近將李叔同的法書，在滬陳列展覽，並印出特刊，載有「幻緣」，叙說弘一大師的偉大，開首一段即云「世上文人藝士，最容易與佛法接近。因為這兩連人，寓於智憲及情感的緣故，便容易了世如幻，悟世無常，所以編文選的梁昭明太子，深通佛法，作文心　龍的劉彥和，竟出家僧，善書的王右軍，善憲的顧虎頭，皆與佛敎有極深的關係。一所以李叔同出家，是一件很自然的事情。</p>
<p>我們也不必批評文藝家出家為僧，是對不對；但是一個人要入世的話，必定要拿出世的精神，為人羣謀福利；也必定感覺人生的無常與幻減，而發出偉大的願望來。華嚴宗的普賢行願品，謂不度盡衆生，誓不成佛！道種願望，在一位崇高的文藝家，是應該具有的心情。游戲於那綫條色彩的美麗，而不溺於聲色貨利；留　　寳貴的靑春，而不頹廢墮落！所謂歸眞返樸，斂神鐵鋒，文藝家的修養，與法佛是很能接近的。今因弘一大師這畢展覺，特別提出這個與人羣哲學，世界思想，都有深密關係的問題、來表示我們的追念。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　163</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我的話說剛一牛了，外面電話來了，繼羣靠電活近、動作又快，她已經把耳機話筒取下；</p>
<p>「喂，……是，…什麼？……」　羣的聲音，一字比一字高了上去；最後兩個字，又高又尖，表示極度的驚詫；緊接把聽簡貼在胸口，生恐我們聽見了對方的言語似的。她低下頭，停了一會，才慢慢把聽筒掛上了。</p>
<p>這時屋子裏沉靜極了，四個人各有不同的表情，然而一致的都顯得十分緊張。屋子一靜，立時可以聽到城外議陰的砲聲，和斷斷　續的機槍聲、攙和着大待上喧雜的汽車喇叭，從高空傳來，刺　着我們的耳　。</p>
<p>羣轉過身來的當口，臉上類色巳經變了；</p>
<p>「岳先生，」　羣的聲音，低沉得幾乎聽不見，「恊和的電話；」</p>
<p>「噢！」鶴見很紋感的應着，「吳先生？……」</p>
<p>「是！…」耀羣答應着，「…三點多鎭…」</p>
<p>「可憐得很！」我認為鼎元又自殺了。</p>
<p>「死了嗎？」　見問，神情頗是悽了惶。</p>
<p>「同死　不多…他走了！留下兩封信，一封給醫院，致　他們的優待；一封是給岳先生的，醫院已經差人送來了。據說，有人看見吳先生是往西邊去的，大約已經出城了。」</p>
<p>「不可能，」鶴見堅持着自己的一種見解，「根據上午我勿所得的電話，松井表示今晚平定浦淸北平。西直門，西便門、現在有激烈的戰事，吳先生為樣出城？」鶴見一壁說一壁已經接了電鈴呌人。</p>
<p>「那正是　明吳先生是去送死！不是嗎？」　羣的臉色　得更加慘白了。</p>
<p>「〇四號」又在門前轟立着。</p>
<p>「老大哥，「〇四』認識吳先生嗎？」鶴見問我。</p>
<p>「認識。」我趕着答應。</p>
<p>「老申」鶴見對「〇四」說，「帶上特字微章和臂章，領四個人，開一部軍子，先到協和，問淸楚，剛才出走的吳工程師，穿的甚什衣服，帽子，顏色，特記；　後羣跡—上走西直門出城。遇見國軍，掩起符號，遇見日軍，放開符記，隨時打電話回來，不問找得着找不着。目標；長辛店；最好晚八點回部！」</p>
<p>「〇四」一　鶴見發命令，立刻搯出小記事册，隨吆隨記。鶴見命令發完，「〇四」也記完。隨即接着自己記下的大綱，重放向鶴見念了一遍，以免錯誤，這是受過訓練的特務人員，必有的一種手續。可憐的一點，「〇四」患着口吃，複念的時候，吃力之至，眼睛珠子都念得要爆炸了。鶴見一到緊急頭上，性質頓時變烈火一樣，看見「〇四」如此結結哨　，有些忍耐不下，便走過去把「〇四」的記事册搶過來，自已檢視。檢視完了，認為沒有造漏，立刻鄭還給「〇四」，順子一揮，意思呌「〇四」快走。</p>

<h3>遍地干戈在海外有桃源　但願桃源永遠年青</h3>
<p>— 武弘</p>
<p>在這個貪婪殘忍爭權奪利，自私自利，唯利是圖的世界上，每天每地，爲一個「私有財產」觀念的人類，但最近在台灣島的東南海面，卻發現了這么一個世外桃源，極似陶淵明的「桃花源記」，和西哲所稱的「烏托邦」。</p>
<p>距臺東五十六里，火燒島四十里，有一個名呌「紅頭嶼」的小島，現爲我國最東的領土疆界。島上共有居民一千二百七十五人，均馬來番族，現仍過着原始生活，男子裸體勞作，日出而作，日暮而憇，合羣而居，尙無「私有財產」的觀念。</p>
<p>島上盛產「五葉蝴蝶蘭」，是全球著名的唯一特產。自爲台省公署發現後，一般人誤認該島原名的「紅頭」一辭，含有「紅蟲毒害」的意思，復須加以「開發」工作，台省公署乃決定改稱爲「蘭嶼島」，以與島上的特產「五葉蝴蝶蘭」相符。蘭嶼現與紅頭嶼同是屬於台東縣的二鄉。</p>
<p>想不到在我們「如此這般」的國度里，還存在着這么一個古趣盎然，古風可嘉的「烏托邦」。筆者在慶幸之餘，只希望該島在被「開發」之後，不要推動它可愛的本來面目。</p>
<p>但願桃源永遠年青</p>
<h3>上海地下層</h3>
<p>— 予蜂</p>
<p>寂靜了好多時的米價，最近卻又發生波動了。一跳二跳的狂漲了起來，於是　微薄的薪給維持過活的人們就　急了起來；但是在上海有着一個實際上和糧食問題同等生婪的糞便問題，卻從來沒有引起過上海人的特別注意。正像現在的社會怎樣的重視把表面粉飾很好一點而忽略了實際上最基層的工作一樣。然而假使有一天全上海的人士們的「去路」而必須暫時「囤積」一下的話，這結果一定會使每人都感到這事更嚴重於糧食問題。要知道，上海的糞便「出口」量，是較米糧的「進口」量還來得多的。</p>
<p>「糞」誰都知道是一種　田的肥料，假使在鄉村，自己有田的，可以把它來肥田，沒有田的，至少也可向人家去換些菜蔬來喫。但在上海卻對你不起了，每天一桶桶無代價地給倒老爺們倒去不算，到了月底，還得要你付上好幾千塊錢的　　不付就不倒，做市民的，遇到別的事還可爭爭理，碰到這類事卻就不由你強，給你乾擱上二三天，也够你受的了。所以倒老爺之所以爲倒老爺，在上海這地方，是有其百分之百的存在理由的。</p>
<p>整個上海四五百萬架的造糞機，整天生產的結果，自然是一個極龐大的數字，單就全市二千餘輛而每輛將清除一二百隻便桶的存貨的糞車者，也可窺知上海這大量糞便出產的一斑了。倒老爺們大槪在午夜三四時就推着車出動了。看他們雖然是衣衫襤褸，手上卻總套着幾個亮晃晃黃澄澄的金戒，到月底來收酒錢時有的更是西裝革履，派頭一落，與早上推車時直判若兩人。倒老爺收入之富裕，普通的公務員是休想與之比擬的。</p>
<p>至於這些出產的糞便，卻有好幾個碼頭上停　船等　收買。糞販們都搶買中區的糞，因爲住中區的人似乎總比較有錢，有錢則吃的亦好，生產出的自然油水也足了。而糞碼頭的糞販更有好幾幫，如松江，江北，本地等等，爲了搶買好糞，常常會因此而演全武行，而黃牛黨更無孔不入的在這裏「擺道子」，燕舞鶯歌錢孝敬，能包你買好糞，所以做糞販的除了出官價買糞之外，更好「外插花」的攪落些小錢。</p>
<p>本來，上海的糞是由糞大王承包辦的，而做這項生意的新沒有一個不發財。在糞事業未歸當局辦理以前，上海絡續的產生了許多糞大王，住洋房坐汔車，更有　好幾房的姨術術，舉止闊綽；這種豪華，也足以說明糞不僅與黃金顏色相同，且其價值亦是相等。然而現在糞大王是終於絕跡了，祇剩下了一班正在　營想做未來的糞大王的人。</p>
<p>上海「糞」的出路除了由倒老爺倒去之外，另有許多人家用抽水馬桶或是在公坑出恭的。上海雖有許多的公坑，但是有時也會感到這些公坑分佈的不勻不足，於是一度普安路等處曾有人開設了大便公司—私坑，大抵是一間沿街的破舊房屋裏面放幾隻沒蓋的馬桶，利用　揚出來的臭氣做廣告，男男女女的客人，就不問自知的走了進去，也不管你有否帶了草紙，皆須繳納草紙費數百元，始准就位。這種私坑每天要接納數百顧客，門庭若市，只是苦了附近的居民，無時無刻都在享受着令人窒息的臭氧，不過目下這些私坑大槪已絕跡的了。</p>
<h3>美國新娘在英國</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>一個細長的美國姑娘，披着一頭紅而長的頭髮，穩然的用她的一雙穿着玻璃絲襪的腳跨出飛機，踏上英國的土地。</p>
<p>她滿面笑容的受了移民局和海關的檢查，走向我們的街道來，開始過她的作爲一個英國主婦的新生活。</p>
<p>她到了新的家，幾小時之內就顯出了「顏色」，她分給每位女性的新親戚兩雙她們所沒有的—或者近乎沒有的—玻璃絲襪！（海關，意外的，允許她的十五雙玻璃絲襪免稅）。</p>
<p>她從一個比較富有的國度來到一個樣樣都要配給證的國度。她從一所寬敞的摩登的美國住宅來到一所破損的平房（還是其弟盡最大的的努力替她找的）。</p>
<p>車間裏頭沒有汽車，廚房裏頭沒冰箱，什麽電動的攪拌器，烘焙器，洗衣機，或者洗地板機，一樣都沒有。</p>
<p>第一天，她在「高街」上看見主婦們排着一條長蛇陣在候着買香蕉，於她排進去了。二十分鐘之後，她變成第一個人了，對店員說「謝謝你，我買點香蕉」。但是當店員回答說：「對不起，女士，沒有配給證就沒有香蕉」的時候，她面孔緋紅默然的潛逃開去。</p>
<p>有一天，在她的晒衣繩上一次掛了六雙琉璃絲襪，起全街的人指手劃脚的鬆鬆私議。</p>
<p>「我猜想這是因爲大多數的英國婦女是寶貴她們的最後兩雙的頂頂時髦的尼龍絲襪」。她後來告訴人家說。</p>
<p>其他使這新娘覺得「真有趣」的事物是：憑兩本「購貨登記薄」屠夫每星期五售一次肉給她；在一字長蛇陣中站立十分鐘後從雜貨店裏買到一磅極小的馬鈴薯；用一隻小的輪用的熨斗燙她的被單和約翰的襯衫，吃用煮熟的水果製的奶油蛋糕。（譯自一月份「不列顛雜誌」）</p>

<h3>美國當前的嚴重社會問題</h3>
<p>— 合眾社特稿　本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>法官說：『…錢太多，是造成離婚的一個生大原因，因爲發「戰爭財」的人們，由於飽暖思淫慾，對於糟糠之妻，不能再忍耐下去了。』</p>
<p>據調查所得，一九四六年美國全國的離婚案數字突破最高紀錄，而且繼續遞增不已。以若干主要城市爲例，去年一年中的離婚案件數，均創有史以來的新紀錄。</p>
<p>辦理離婚案的法官提出許多原因，說明這離婚的高潮，其中被公認的一種原因是草草結合的戰時婚姻。但叧外一部分法官則怪戰時賺錢太多。</p>
<p>與論的放任</p>
<p>其他的原因爲房屋恐慌，居處侷促，與論對於離婚的放任，宗教勢力的衰落，退伍軍人不慣家庭生活等等。</p>
<p>某法官說：「戰時結合的夫婦，每五對中有四對結局是離婚。」另一法官說：「常有一對男女偶然邂逅，一見傾心，就在當天結合爲夫婦。」又有一位法官說：「因毆打老婆而鬧離婚的案件，一天多似一天。此外「錢太多」也是造成離婚的一個重大原因。因爲發戰爭財的人們，由於「飽暖思淫慾」，對於「糟糠之妻」不能再忍耐下去了。」</p>
<p>美國離婚案的大本營雷諾城，一九四六年的離婚案總計一萬一千件，打破一九四五年八千五百件的紀錄。該城所隸屬的標伐達州全州的離婚案亦創二萬件新紀錄。雷諾城的地方法官說：「據我看起來，一九四七年的離婚案件的數字定有過之無不及。」</p>
<p>驚人的數目</p>
<p>從一九四五年七月一日到一九四六年七月一日的一年中，紐約州的離婚案件總計一萬九千八百九十五件，以前的一年中只有一萬三千零七十一件。　料一九四六年下半年中有繼續增加之勢。芝加哥的離婚數字爲一七〇四六件，洛杉磯和好萊塢的離婚數字雖還沒有發表，但當局相信一九四六年的數字一定是新的紀錄。</p>
<p>離婚法廢止乎</p>
<p>美國各地離婚案的激增，使若干州的當局採取某種防範措置。麻薩朱色州波士頓眾院議員唐蘭曾在州議會中提出廢止該州離婚法的法案。</p>

<h3>歐洲火藥庫的幕後人物　統治保加利亞的女人</h3>
<p>— 佳原譯</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島是歐洲的火藥庫，已往如此，現在還是這樣。目前該半島上除希臘和土耳其的一部份外，其餘國家的實權，實際上是操在蘇聯手中，然而蘇陽用什麽方法來掌握這些國家，使她們新馴服在自己的勢力圈內，不敢稍有　越的呢？有人說她靠紅軍，也有人說她靠大　政治秘密人員。這話固然對，但是除了紅軍和秘密人員之外，還靠幾個出類拔萃的女人。</p>
<p>在保加利亞，假使你偷偷地去打聽：「誰是保國的實際統治者？」你所獲得的答覆是：「查拉·特拉哥契伐。」這個年　四十六歲現任祖國陣綫全國委員會秘書長的老共產黨員，具有無上的權力。她彷彿報了一根鞭子，統治着保加利亞。</p>
<p>曾被判處死刑</p>
<p>說起查拉的身世，是够刺激的。曾有一時，她是全國聞名的美婦人，頭髮像火一般地發出熱烈的紅色，眼睛則作碧色。從前她曾密謀推翻保王鮑里斯的獨裁政權而被捕，業經判處死刑。但她之所以不死，是一椿奇跡。原來在她執行死刑的六天之前，她突然要求獄吏舉行一次體格檢查，獄吏倒也滿不在乎，以爲一個祇有六天可活的囚犯，檢查檢查身體未免有點無謂而可笑，終於隨便地答應了。可是檢查的結果，却證明她懷有身孕，而根據保加利亞的法律，凡有身孕的女子不能處死，於是法庭不得不把死刑改爲無期徒刑。</p>
<p>查拉的孩子是在獄中生下來的。她帶了「救她一命」的孩子在獄中生活，對於保國監獄中情形獲得了最親切的智識。查拉在監獄中的名氣很大，所以政府不進把她調換監禁的地方。母子兩人十年中就在不斷地　徒中度生活，對於外界的情形茫　所知，但是她激烈的個性並未改變。</p>
<p>潛伏幕後拉綫</p>
<p>其後適逢保國大赦，查拉自獄中獲釋，但被放逐出國。她到了莫斯科，遇見保加利亞共產黨首創者鍬密德羅夫·狄氏立刻認爲她是可造之材，從事訓練她，以備將來在保加利亞發動政變時担任領導工作。繼而蘇德戰爭爆發，她就在一九四二年以降落乎富有戲劇性地跳落保加利亞境內，開始在保國境內進行嚴密的組織工作。當一九四四年九月九日祖國陣綫集團推翻最後一個納粹傀儡政權時，　政府在　收工作方而毫無困難，這都是查拉往日的功績。從此以後，他就變成了　治也夫內　的幕後牽綫人，用她的鐵腕，實際上統治着這個與希臘和土耳其毗鄰，在軍略上具有重大意義的國家—保加利亞。</p>

<h3>The U.S. Mediation in China Has Ended; U.S. Troops Will Withdraw from China as Soon as Possible: Marshall Reports at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Washington, March 7th, Agence France-Presse] Secretary of State Marshall recently held his first press conference, explaining that the U.S. government's decision to end the mediation of China's internal strife was due to the United States' lack of interest in this kind of mediation that existed in name only. He also stated that U.S. troops stationed in China would be withdrawn as soon as possible within the scope of possibility. However, the troops stationed in Qingdao will not be withdrawn for the time being because they are training the Chinese navy to use coastal and other warships. Qingdao is the only location where the U.S. military intends to remain.</p>
<p>[Washington, March 7th, Central News Agency] The newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, with the strong and heroic demeanor he maintained as Army Chief of Staff, held his first press conference this afternoon since returning from China. Mr. Marshall spoke for a total of forty-five minutes, discussing several world issues but not mentioning U.S.-Soviet relations. Today's press conference was unusual, with some information that could be published, some that could not, and some that could not be published in his name. Mr. Marshall did not comment on any issues regarding Europe or the policies and recommendations for the upcoming Moscow conference. Mr. Marshall's serious demeanor made reporters, who were accustomed to interviewing and responding with ease and experience, feel cold. Mr. Marshall discussed more than ten issues, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding general policy, he will follow the policies of Truman and Byrnes, that is, to strengthen the United Nations with all efforts, making it a tool for discussing international issues and maintaining world peace, and to make the power of the United States have an impact on international events. He will actively strive for peaceful resolutions based on this policy, making it a solid foundation on which the United Nations can function.</p>
<p>Regarding the China issue, Mr. Marshall stated that the United States has ended its participation in the Three-Man Team and the Peiping Executive Headquarters. The State Department's statement did not mention the Marine Corps, but this point was already stated in his January 8th statement. The Executive Headquarters has reached a state where it cannot function. Therefore, he himself, President Truman, and the State Department believe that mediation that exists in name only should be terminated, otherwise, it will cause confusion among the general public, especially the Chinese people, and thus lead to many other complex concepts.</p>
<p>Small Number of U.S. Troops Remain Stationed in Qingdao; 500 Million Loan Stored Unused</p>
<p>The purpose of the Marine Corps going to China was special, namely to send the two million Japanese troops in China and one million Japanese troops in the Northeast (at least) back to their country. This task was practically completed in May of last year, but a small number of Marine Corps continued to protect the Executive Headquarters, the transportation line from Qinhuangdao, Tanggu, to Peiping, and to ensure the safety of its personnel, which was indeed necessary. At the same time, the U.S. Marine Corps was also responsible for protecting personnel distributed in a considerably vast area of the mainland. The Executive Headquarters had to contact the execution team by plane every week, and also had radio contact every day. After the United States withdrew from the Executive Headquarters, the security mission of the Marine Corps also ended. The general public has misunderstandings about the handling of the U.S. Marine Corps. The United States' policy towards China was clearly explained in President Truman's statement on December 18th of last year and in his own statement on January 8th of this year. The number of Marine Corps stationed in China is very small and has specific duties. Currently, there are still a small number of Marine Corps in Qingdao, assisting in training the Chinese navy to defend China's coastal areas from pirates and smuggling activities. The water there is deep and the sea is vast, and the U.S. Seventh Fleet is anchored there.</p>
<p>Regarding the 500 million loan to China, Mr. Marshall stated that President Truman's statement on December 18th had explained it clearly. Mr. Truman stated that the U.S. Export-Import Bank plans to lend another 500 million yuan to Chinese government-run institutions and private enterprises. The agreement to implement this loan plan must be based on the policy announced by the U.S. government on December 15th, 1945. This 500 million U.S. dollars is stored for use and has not been spent. (More on Marshal's talk, see page 4)</p>
<p>[Washington, March 7th, United Press] Secretary of State Marshall issued a written statement at a press conference. When mentioning China in the statement, he said that he, the President, and the State Department have all given up mediating in China because they all feel that mediation is "not appropriate" while negotiations with artillery fire or the like continue. This was Mr. Marshall's first decision to attend a press conference after taking office, and the first time he made an important statement. The frankness and comprehensiveness of its content have not been seen in the State Department for many years. About 150 reporters participated, twice as many as usual.</p>
<h3>U.S. May Impose Additional Tariffs on Subsidized Goods Imported into the United States; U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai Issued a Notice Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since our government announced a 100% export subsidy, foreign businesses have had mixed reactions. Yesterday, the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai specifically issued a circular to relevant exporters, informing them of the provisions in the U.S. tax law regarding foreign countries adopting export subsidies for reference. The circular stated: According to the tax law passed and implemented in the United States in 1930 and the U.S. customs regulations, if goods that are imported into the United States from foreign countries and are subject to U.S. tariffs are subject to a subsidy system in the exporting country at the time of export, the United States will also levy an additional tax equal to the amount of the subsidy when the goods are imported into the United States. According to the interpretation of this provision, with the export subsidy system adopted by our country, in future export trade to the United States, except for a few exports that can be imported into the United States duty-free, such as bristles and tung oil, other taxable exports will hardly be able to obtain the benefits of export subsidies. Regarding exports to the United States, the U.S. Consulate also requires exporters to list any discounts, rebates, or subsidies for the exports on the U.S. Consulate invoice for reference. According to the U.S. Consulate, the United States had exceptions for some economically backward countries when implementing this tax rule during the war. Moreover, assisting China's reconstruction is originally the policy of the United States. Therefore, it may be possible to consider exceptions for the current situation. However, it still remains to be proven by facts.</p>
<h3>U.S. Will Protest China's Exchange Settlement Methods</h3>
<p>[Washington, March 7th, United Press] Government officials recently stated that regarding China's recent draft exchange settlement methods, which impose a 50% surcharge on certain imported goods, the United States may formally protest to China after it is formally notified to Washington. Official opinion is that China's method of levying import surcharges and granting 100% subsidies on exports will encourage export trade. Although it is legal for Chinese exporters to profit from foreign trade by obtaining an exchange rate equivalent to the black market, import surcharges may cause protests from the United States because this method will thwart the United States' efforts to reduce trade barriers and allow free flow of world trade. This matter is purely a matter of principle. China has not yet formally notified the United States, but the State Department has fully considered this matter and will express something to China as soon as it receives formal notification.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Accepts French Government Medal</h3>
<p>[Paris, March 7th, Agence France-Presse] Regarding the French government's plan to award military medals to Chairman Chiang and the late U.S. President Roosevelt, it has been learned that Chairman Chiang has expressed his acceptance. After hearing the news, the Chairman said: I am deeply grateful to the French government for bestowing this honor upon me.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shiyi's New Book in England: English Version of Biography of Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Already in Print; Available in June</p>
<p>[London, March 6th, Central News Agency Special Dispatch] Renowned writer Xiong Shiyi has completed the English "Biography of Chairman Chiang," which describes in great detail Chairman Chiang's achievements from the Northern Expedition to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The author drew materials from letters and archives of Chairman Chiang and his subordinates. The book is already in printing and is expected to be available for sale in June.</p>
<h3>Conveners of Proposal Committees of the Third Plenary Session Decided</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, March 8th, Our Report] The list of conveners of the proposal committees of the Third Plenary Session has been decided as follows: Party Affairs: Chen Lifu, Wang Qijiang; Politics: Yu Youren, Li Wenfan; Economy: Chen Guofu, Song Ziwen; Constitutional Government: Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Harass Towns and Cities Along the Yalu River</h3>
<p>Communist Troops Attacking Tonghua Have Been Repelled</p>
<p>[Shenyang, March 7th, Our Report] Communist troops on the Yalu River have recently threatened various towns and cities. From 3:00 PM on the 6th, the main force of the Communist 10th and 11th Brigades launched seven fierce attacks on Huanren to coordinate the battle on Tonghua and disrupt the area east of the Shen-An Road. On the morning of the 7th, they retreated to Ji'an. In Tonghua, the Communist Independent 2nd Division, about 2,000 people, was repelled by the National Army at Erdaojiang, and Tonghua has stabilized.</p>
<h3>National Army in Liaodong Advances Southward; Only Thirty Li from Dalian; Preparations for Takeover Are Being Intensified</h3>
<p>[Peiping, March 8th, Our Report] People coming from the Northeast say that the National Army in Liaodong Peninsula is advancing southward, and the vanguard is only thirty *li* from Dalian. It is said that the National Army stationed in Pulandian, after obtaining the understanding of the Soviet army in Jinzhou, advanced eighty kilometers on the 3rd. The vanguard reached the left wing of Nanguanling, passed Niujiaoshan, and advanced towards Ganjingzi. Dalian is now in sight. Preparations for the takeover are being intensified. It is said that it has been decided to divide Dalian into twelve districts, and police are being trained to take over with the army. Mayor Gong is expected to come north with Xiong Shihui soon.</p>
<p>The issue of the takeover of Dalian is still under negotiation. The National Army on the front line in Pulandian is of great concern to all parties.

<h3>National Army in Central Shandong Crosses Laiwu and Moves Southward; Recovers Xintai, Mengyin Village; Communist Troops in Linyi Are Like Candles in the Wind</h3>

Because the main force of the Communist 4th and 9th Divisions was almost completely destroyed in the battle of Caojiazhuang, the National Army's advance was like destroying rotten branches and leaves.

<h3>Performance of Various Ministries, Commissions, Provincial and Municipal Governments Subject to Thorough Evaluation by Chairman's Order; Five Measures Stipulated, to be Completed Before the End of April; Personnel of Northeast Mines and Factories Commended by Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Chairman Chiang is paying close attention to the administrative achievements of various ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments in the 35th year, and has specifically ordered the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee to thoroughly evaluate them, determine their merits and demerits, and use this as a basis for rewards and punishments. Five evaluation measures have been approved: (1) The evaluation of the performance of various provinces and municipalities will continue to be carried out by the Executive Yuan according to the original methods. The evaluation of the performance of the various ministries and commissions and the Auditing Department and the Ministry of Personnel of the Executive Yuan will be initially reviewed by the respective governing Yuan and then submitted to the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee for comprehensive review, so as to give full play to the spirit of graded evaluation. (2) The evaluation items will focus on the most important central tasks. (3) The evaluation method will first summarize and review the usual inspections, evaluations, work reports, work progress, evaluation reports and other materials, and then conduct thorough audits. When necessary, personnel will be sent to conduct on-site random checks of units considered to have the best and worst performance, so as to prove the actual basis for rewards and punishments. (4) The evaluation method will adopt a scoring system and formulate rewards and punishments. (5) The evaluation of the performance of the various ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments must be completed by the end of April this year. The affairs of various Yuan and commissions must be sent to the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee before the end of March this year for joint processing.</p>

It is reported that Chairman Chiang highly praised the enthusiasm of the personnel of various factories and mines in the Northeast for their loyalty to the country, and has telegraphed the Northeast Headquarters to give them commendations, and ordered a thorough investigation of those who died in the line of duty and provided preferential treatment to their families, in order to encourage them and comfort the loyal souls.</p>
<h3>Li Zonghuang Talks to Reporters About the Past Work of the Evaluation Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Supreme National Defense Council recently decided to merge the Central Design Bureau and the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee into the Design and Evaluation Office, directly under the National Government. Today, reporters specifically visited Secretary-General Li Zonghuang of the Evaluation Committee, who answered the following questions:</p>
<p>Question: Your committee will be merged with the Central Design Bureau into the Design and Evaluation Office and be subordinate to the National Government. I wonder if there is any legal basis for this, and whether there is any conflict between its powers and the Five Yuans?</p>
<p>Answer: The powers of the Evaluation Office do not conflict with those of the Five Yuans. As for being subordinate to the National Government, it is a necessity in fact. The administrative three-link system should indeed be spread throughout all departments, but only the highest organ, the National Government, has the power for overall design and overall evaluation. There is also no conflict between evaluation and supervision. Supervision focuses on the illegal and derelict behavior of officials, while evaluation focuses on work efficiency. Supervision is under the ruling power, while evaluation is the balance of power itself. Over the years, the supervision and evaluation systems have only had the effect of mutual benefit and have not had the drawbacks of duplication and conflict.</p>
<p>Question: What are the gains and losses after your committee merges with the Central Design Bureau?</p>
<p>Answer: Our committee and the Central Design Bureau are important departments of the administrative three-link system. After the merger of the institutions, there are only benefits and no disadvantages, because a precise and reasonable design must be based on facts and suggestions for improvement provided by the evaluation in order to be accurate and effective. If the evaluation does not fully understand the nature of the work design and national policy, and only focuses on the trivial affairs work, it will lose the main purpose of the evaluation. Therefore, the three parts of design, execution, and evaluation work must be coordinated with each other at all times. In the past, in order to seek contact between the three parts of the work, a joint meeting of the bureau, committee, and office (Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics) was established. This reorganization, which is also subordinate to the National Government together with the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics, can better exert the effect of active contact, and after the merger, the expenses and personnel can be greatly reduced, which is more in line with the principles of streamlining staff and reforming politics.</p>
<p>Question: The outside world does not understand the work of your committee very well. Can you briefly tell us about the general situation of your past work, selecting the main points?</p>
<p>Answer: Our committee was established in October of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940) and has been in existence for six years. Because its nature is a staff agency and the evaluation is confidential, it does not focus on publicity to the outside world, so the outside world does not understand it very well. However, since its establishment, in terms of political evaluation alone, it has inspected 1,604 government agencies and submitted requests to abolish more than 40 agencies. There are 612 agencies that have been supervised by our committee to establish design and evaluation committees. There are 1,753 suggestions for improvement in economic construction, local autonomy, grain administration, conscription, drug prohibition, and general administration, which have been submitted to the Chairman for approval and handed over to the competent authorities for handling, which is not without benefit to the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Before the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the annual work plans drafted by central and local agencies were huge and impractical, or only had budgets but no work plans. Our committee pointed out its malpractices and used a scoring method to judge the merits and demerits of the progress of its plans. Therefore, the plans of the agencies gradually became practical, and the work reports were also more accurate than before. Therefore, the average results have also improved year by year, and have indeed achieved the effect of changing the social atmosphere. The evaluation methods used are also improving day by day.</p>
<p>Question: What are the differences between the evaluation methods used by your committee now and in the past? What are the advantages and disadvantages?</p>
<p>Answer: In the past, there were too many evaluation items, and the preliminary evaluation was not carried out, so our committee directly evaluated them, which was prone to the disadvantage of being broad and neglecting the details. In addition, too many reports were compiled and delivered too late, resulting in improvement suggestions often losing their timeliness. Now, many design and evaluation committees have been established in various agencies. Recently, the Chairman instructed that in the future, we will strengthen the supervision of various agencies to implement graded evaluation and regular evaluation, limit the central tasks, and focus on timeliness, and strictly reward and punish them. Our committee will focus on overall review and review in the future, and its effectiveness will be further increased. After the merger, it will be able to connect with design and budgeting, and will be able to exert its effectiveness even more.</p>
<h3>Tani Hisao Tried for the Third Time; Prosecutor Points Out that the Massacre Was a Planned Act; Court Announces Regular Continuation of Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Japanese war criminal Tani Hisao continued his third public trial on the afternoon of the 8th. Tani first made a statement on the evidence presented on the 7th: (1) Most of the evidence presented was outside the Zhonghua Gate, during the two days of December 12th and 13th. At this time, there was fierce fighting, and residents should have fled to safe areas. (2) There was fierce fighting all day on the 12th, and there was no time to kill civilians. It can be said that it would never have happened, and it would never have been allowed, and it could not have been unknown. (3) Most of the areas are outside the defense zone of the accused's troops and are located in the 114th Division Brigade. The above three points, please pay special attention to the court.</p>
<p>The Presiding Judge Announced a Collective Massacre</p>
<p>Then, Presiding Judge Shi announced the collective massacre case: (1) After Tani's troops entered the city on December 12, more than 51,000 captured National Army soldiers were imprisoned at the foot of Mount Mufu and immediately escorted to Caoxie Gorge, Xixia, where they were shot with machine guns, and then the bodies were thrown into the river. There are eyewitnesses who escaped death at the time, who can be questioned immediately. Tani argued: The accused's troops stayed at Zhonghua Gate and did not know about this incident. It may have been done by the navy, or by the main force. Presiding Judge Shi continued to announce (2) On December 15, more than 9,000 civilians and National Army soldiers were escorted to the Xixia torpedo camp and collectively shot to death with machine guns, among which eight or nine people did not die and can testify. Tani said: I hope to find more evidence. The accused has nothing to do with it. Presiding Judge Shi continued to announce (3) On the evening of December 16, more than 5,000 refugees were escorted from the Overseas Chinese Reception Center to Zhongshan Wharf and shot with machine guns. The eyewitness Liang Tingfang was present to explain the experience of escaping death. Tani immediately asked which unit it was, but did not receive a reply. Bai Jingyu also claimed to be one of the survivors and came forward to testify. Presiding Judge Shi then questioned Tani whether he had read the Asahi Shimbun report when Nanjing was captured, which stated that two Japanese people competed to kill people, and as a result, one killed 104 people and the other killed 107 people. Tani said: This is the first time I have heard of this matter, and the accused is completely unaware of it.</p>
<p>Witnesses Appear in Court to Describe Atrocities</p>
<p>Then Chen Fubao, who testified at the Tokyo International Tribunal last year, appeared in court, stating: There are five points that can prove the enemy's atrocities: (1) On the morning of December 15, five Japanese soldiers drove us to Xinqiao, and 39 people were all shot to death and then pushed into the pond. I witnessed this with my own eyes. (2) On the evening of the 14th, a Japanese soldier took me to a residential area to search for property and saw a girl being gang-raped. (3) On the morning of the 16th, they used us as a game. If we were pushed down, they would laugh, and if we did not fall, they would stab us. (4) On the afternoon of the 16th, they forced us to lead them to Taiping Road, starting from the burning Global Hotel, and saw a Japanese soldier rape a pregnant woman, resulting in a miscarriage. (5) From January 5 to 8, there was another massacre, which seemed to be a premeditated plan. Tani immediately said: The area described by the witness has nothing to do with the accused's troops. Then Yin Youyu, a witness in the second case of the collective massacre, appeared to explain. Zhu Guangrong stated that when his son was killed, he saw that the troops were carrying items with the word "Tani" written on them. Tani said that the troops never carried flags or wrote words during combat. Zhu then said that he personally saw the Japanese rape four women in a shed, and then use bayonets to stab them in the chest and pull out their intestines and stomachs, which was extremely cruel. Tani said that there would never be women at the time. There were also Xiao Panshi, Lu Gaoshi, and others who told their husbands that their sons were killed. Tani denied all of this. At this point, Presiding Judge Shi declared: Tani's troops robbed Chen's family of 28 boxes of property in Baoding and Shijiazhuang, and forced women to provide physical comfort. Tani immediately denied it. At 4:00 PM, the presiding judge announced a break.</p>
<p>The Prosecutor's Words Were Passionate and Painful</p>
<p>The trial continued at 4:20 PM. The court announced that the investigation of the evidence was completed and began the debate. First, Prosecutor Chen Guangyu reported the details of the crimes such as arson, robbery, and rape, and stated that the Nanjing Massacre was a planned and entire act. The Japanese used their greatest strength to complete this unprecedented holocaust. All participating troops should be responsible, and the accused participated, so he should be responsible. At the same time, the accused's troops were the only troops in the city during the two days of the 13th and 14th, and the crimes were even more obvious. Finally, he said: The Chinese nation has always been broad-minded and does not seek revenge, but this hatred, even ten, a hundred, or ten thousand Tani Hisaos, cannot wash away the pain of such foreign humiliation. Please court sentence him to death. The entire audience applauded, and Tani's face turned red, and he was in a state of embarrassment and uneasiness.</p>
<p>Tani's Defense Was Full of Sophistry</p>
<p>Tani's defense was as follows: (1) The incident of forcing women to provide comfort in Baoding was completely untrue. (2) The incidents near the Zhonghua Gate are not correct and cannot be recognized. (3) The names of the victims and the types of victims are not detailed. It is not enough to say that it constitutes a criminal fact based only on the statements in court. There is no precedent for this in the world's trials. The year, the day, the place, and the specific facts must be presented. The Tokyo International Tribunal is still waiting for the American victim to testify about a prisoner being beaten, and the crime can only be determined after confrontation and multiple interrogations. He also said that the accused felt very sorry for this kind of unreasonable argument and hoped that the court would study it in detail and make a fair judgment after both Chinese and Japanese witnesses mentioned it. Then he explained a few points, thinking that the facts were not correct: (1) There were two days of fierce fighting in the Yuhuatai area near Zhonghua Gate. Matsui would command civilians to go to safe areas. The accused's troops were stationed in a no-man's land, so there was no killing. (2) The destruction of property in the North China Incident may have been caused by Japanese aircraft bombing and artillery fire, or by the destruction of Chinese plainclothes troops, and cannot be attributed to the accused's troops. (3) The accused's military discipline was strict, and he always instructed his subordinates, and there were no incidents. (4) The accused did not see or hear any of the alleged incidents, nor did he issue any orders or receive any reports from anyone. Finally, he said: The accused's troops had a total of 65 squadrons. Taking one subordinate into account, one squadron killed 15 people, one battalion killed 60 people, and 150 people were killed every day. There is no such large proportion. The accused's troops had a total of 15,000 people, and one-third of them departed in one week. Another third departed on the morning of the 18th. By the 21st, the accused's troops had already arrived in Wuhu. The Nanjing incident may have happened after the accused departed. The trial ended at 6:00 PM. The court announced that it would continue to hold a debate at a scheduled time, and the accused was taken back into custody.</p>

<h3>Sino-British Civil Aviation Agreement to be Discussed Next Week; British Transport Delegation Visited Our Authorities Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Our transportation authorities held their first meeting with the British Transport Delegation to China at 10:00 AM on the 8th to discuss the conclusion of a civil aviation agreement. The opinions of both sides were very close. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM and scheduled to meet again on the 12th for further discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Lieutenant General Paul, head of the British Transport Delegation to China, and four members of the delegation paid a visit to Minister Yu on the morning of the 8th, and were received by Advisor Ling Shifen and Director Dai Anguo of the Civil Aviation Administration. The Sino-British Civil Aviation Agreement has not yet been formally discussed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] The British Transport Delegation and Chinese representatives Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei and Director of Civil Aviation Administration Dai Anguo held a preliminary meeting on the 8th to exchange views on the signing of a Sino-British aviation treaty, and scheduled the first formal meeting for next Wednesday (the 12th). At that time, the draft aviation treaty will be discussed by representatives of both sides. According to Dai, today's meeting did not mention the treaty itself, but only discussed the agenda of the next meeting. Both sides expressed their desire to conclude a reciprocal aviation treaty. Regarding the nature of this agreement, whether it is similar to the Sino-American aviation treaty, Dai refused to comment. Reporters also asked members of the British delegation when the treaty could be signed. It is said that it is too early to predict at this time. The Sino-American aviation treaty took four months to complete.</p>
<h3>Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship Talks Have Reached a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Philippine Proposes New Draft Treaty Overturning Agreement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 7th] After the Philippine Foreign Ministry submitted a new draft of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship to our embassy yesterday, the treaty negotiations reached a stalemate. This draft treaty is tantamount to overturning all the clauses that have been agreed upon in the months of negotiations between the two sides. Senior Philippine government officials, 48 hours ago, still expressed their deep belief that the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship could be signed in the shortest possible time, because what the two sides had negotiated and agreed upon was only a certain clause concerning the convenience that one contracting country would give to the nationals of the other country. Qualified sources here pointed out that the new draft treaty submitted by the Philippine government completely ignores the steps of the treaty, and the Chinese government will not accept this new draft treaty as the basis for continuing negotiations. Our embassy in the Philippines and the Philippine Foreign Ministry are both keeping silent about the possibility of resuming negotiations.</p>
<h3>Hao Yongde, the Main Culprit in the Wanbaoshan Incident, to be Publicly Tried in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch] Hao Yongde, the main culprit in the Wanbaoshan Incident, which was the prelude to the September 18th Incident, will be publicly tried in mid-month, and a debt of national blood can be settled. The files handled in this case have been completely preserved to this day by a former staff member of the Changchun County Government and have now been handed over to the court for handling. It is learned that there are many valuable materials, including conspiracies and tricks of the Japanese invasion of Northeast China. There are many Japanese and Korean people involved in this case. The municipal government once ordered the police station to investigate the Japanese and Korean residents in Changchun, but found nothing. The main culprit, Hao Yongde, is nearly 60 years old and feels quite painful during his detention. According to Chief Prosecutor Sun Yingwu of the High Court, Hao's case is being prosecuted for banditry and should be in the category of reduced sentences. It is also learned that Ma Yuanbo, the former county magistrate of Changchun who accepted bribes in this case (two gold bracelets and 3,000 silver dollars), has white hair and is still alive, living in seclusion in a nearby county, chanting scriptures and praying to spend his remaining years. He was reported by someone, but under the amnesty order, the court stated that it would not prosecute him.</p>

<h3>Legal Tender Falling from the Sky; 30 Million Yuan Picked Up by Villagers; List of Casualties of Plane Crash in Chongqing Released</h3>

<h3>Largest Project in the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River; Mila Mountain Gorge Dam; Planned Construction by the Gansu Provincial Water Conservancy Department</h3>

<h3>The Purchase of the Bai Madam's Cemetery; The Process of Concluding the Contract</h3>
<p>Chen Shijun Talks About Having Paid the Price</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] A Shanghai newspaper published a dispatch from Chengdu with the title "Hu Zhongzhu Resigns from His Post and Quits the Party, Wanting to Recover Lost Land from Bai Chongxi, Because His Ancestral Tomb in Tongliang Was Occupied." A few newspapers in Chongqing and Chengdu also published similar news. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter specifically visited Minister Bai. Mr. Chongxun, the eldest brother of Bai, and Mr. Chen Shijun came out to see me. Chen was the representative who signed the land purchase contract that day. He described the process in detail. According to Chen, Bai's mother, Madam Ma, passed away in Tangxia Town, Tongliang, Sichuan in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945). The Bai family has traditionally followed Islam and does not believe in feng shui. Moreover, the teachings indicate that the burial must be done quickly and cannot be delayed for more than three days. Because the Bai family lived here and was enthusiastic about public welfare, the local people expressed their appreciation. With the introduction of Li Zairong, the town leader of that area, they purchased a vacant lot on the hillside north of the Copper Wall Highway in the town, called Laoyingyan, for burial nearby. After both parties agreed, a contract was signed. The buyer used the name of Bai Shensi Hall. Because Mr. Chongxun and others were overwhelmed with grief, they specifically asked me (Chen himself) and Tang Ji to represent them in signing the contract. The seller was represented by Hu Zhaoxu, the nephew of Hu Zhongzhu. 150,000 yuan in national currency was paid, and Hu Zhongzhu's local township head of Hebianchang, Hu, also came to the scene and signed the contract as proof. After the Bai family purchased the land, they applied to the Tongliang County Government for registration, and the county government publicly announced it in accordance with the law, and stamped the county seal on the contract to ensure credibility. In this situation, the Bai family did not occupy the land. Furthermore, the report stated that Hu Zhongzhu said at a reception for reporters that the land occupied by the Bai family was Huangjiapo [this place is located on the south side of Copper Wall Highway, that is, the location of the former Central Party Headquarters Demonstration Farm and the Women's Handicraft Cooperative of the Relief Committee], which is even more wrong, because Bai Madam's cemetery is in Laoyingyan, which is far away from Huangjiapo.</p>
<h3>The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Stops Aiding Jiangxi Province's Grain and Materials</h3>
<p>Cai Mengjian Flew to Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 8th] The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has stopped aiding Jiangxi Province's grain and materials, which is affecting the promotion of Jiangxi Province's relief work. The public office is now tightening up. According to foreign personnel from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration who inspected Jiangxi, Jiangxi currently has many relief works related to agriculture, such as agricultural fields, dike repairs, and road construction, which require a large amount of grain to complete the various projects. The sudden cessation of aid will have an infinite impact on all work and make this work fall short. Director Cai Mengjian flew to Shanghai on the 8th to negotiate relief affairs with the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Arrival of the British Transportation Delegation in China</h3>
<p>The British Transportation Delegation, led by Lieutenant General Powell, arrived in Nanjing yesterday. According to a Central News Agency report, the delegation's mission is to discuss with the Chinese authorities the extension of British Overseas Airways Corporation's air routes to China and to negotiate and sign a Sino-British civil aviation agreement with our government. However, according to reports from Nanjing, the delegation's mission in China "is to negotiate with the Chinese government on future cooperation in transportation technology on behalf of the British government." Regardless of the delegation's mission, their long journey to China will undoubtedly promote transportation progress between China and Britain. Therefore, we express our welcome to the delegation's arrival in the capital. We regret that, according to reports, the delegation will only stay in China for a few days, a short time that may prevent them from gaining a thorough understanding of China's transportation situation.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must point out that China's modern transportation industry owes much to British assistance. The telegraphs in Tianjin and Shanghai were founded by the British. The Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai), Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou), Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou), and Beining (Beijing-Shenyang) railways were also planned and built by the British. As for inland river and coastal navigation, the fact that they were developed by the British is widely known. At the time, the British may have had their own motives for establishing these modern transportation undertakings in China, but we cannot help but express our sincere gratitude to the far-sighted British entrepreneurs for providing China with its modern transportation industry. Now, domestic transportation has not yet recovered, and the Jinpu Railway, which runs north-south, has not yet been opened to traffic. This is a gift from the Communist Party, which has harmed the country, ruined the people, and created turmoil with armed rebellion. But how can we not feel ashamed towards those who initially built China's modern transportation?</p>
<p>Following the arrival of commercial delegations after the war, the arrival of the British Transportation Delegation in China indicates that our wartime ally is concerned about the post-war restoration of transportation in our country, which is naturally a gratifying thing. Relations between countries are not one-sided but mutual. The primary purpose of the British Transportation Delegation's visit to China is naturally for Britain's own interests, which goes without saying. If their visit is indeed to seek cooperation in transportation technology between China and Britain, it should be beneficial to China, whose transportation technology is relatively backward. However, considering the delegation's brief visit, we cannot help but wonder what benefits their visit can bring to China's post-war transportation construction.</p>
<p>Speaking of civil aviation, the recent series of civil aviation accidents in China have shaken public confidence in civil aviation to some extent. This is not surprising, but we cannot say that civil aviation has no future in China. On the contrary, the development of civil aviation in China is booming. China has signed a civil aviation agreement with the United States, allowing United Airlines and Northwest Airlines to fly to China, and China has also sent planes to test flights to the United States. It has also established a civil aviation agreement with France. If the mission of the British Transportation Delegation is to negotiate the signing of a Sino-British civil aviation agreement, there should be no problem. However, we are concerned that China's aviation industry is underdeveloped and its capacity to produce aviation gasoline is low. On the surface, civil aviation agreements are equal and mutually beneficial, but the actual benefits on both sides may not be equal, resulting in new unequal situations in practice. We hope that our government authorities can pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>As for how to promote civil aviation safety, the recent series of domestic and foreign civil aircraft accidents, with their painful experiences, have forced us to improve the technical equipment of civil aviation. According to news from Melbourne, Australia, the Air Transport Management Committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization has decided to set up a number of management stations in the South Pacific region, and Shanghai has been selected as one of them, which will strengthen civil aviation equipment and control to ensure civil aviation safety. In addition, the government's transportation authorities have also been trying to improve the technical equipment of civil aviation since the recent series of civil aviation accidents. With these two measures, we believe that China's civil aviation will have even greater development in the future.</p>
<p>Britain is advanced in civil aviation. Its overseas aviation business is concentrated in British Overseas Airways Corporation, whose routes cover five continents. Britain also has noteworthy developments in the aviation industry. We hope that the arrival of the British Transportation Delegation will not only lead to the establishment of an air transport agreement between China and Britain, but also to cooperation in civil aviation technology, so that our developing civil aviation can benefit from the experience and technical cooperation of advanced countries and further promote its development. Recalling the past contributions of the British to the development of China's modern transportation industry, we therefore have high hopes for the arrival of this transportation delegation.</p>

<h3>Youth Army Recruits Young People, Aiming to Stabilize Order in Recovered Areas; Training Focuses on Local Security</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] The 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Suzhou recently received an order from the Ministry of National Defense to recruit young refugees from northern Jiangsu and unemployed youth from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The deadline for recruiting a full infantry division is the end of February this year. The division has now set up reception stations in key areas along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to take charge of the management. Our reporter, in order to understand the significance of this, visited Major General Fang Maozhi, Chief of Staff of the division, on the 7th. He was informed that the reason for recruiting these young people is that the recovered areas in northern Jiangsu are expanding, and there is an urgent need to allocate cadres to maintain local security. Therefore, the purpose is entirely to stabilize order in the recovered areas. In the future, when the recruitment is completed, the training will focus on various skills to cope with local security. Occasional education in specialized technical subjects will also be provided to meet the needs of the society in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu. In short, this recruitment is purely for cultivating national rejuvenation cadres.</p>
<h3>Unscrupulous Grain Merchants Drive Up Rice Prices; 50,000 Dan of Hoarded Rice Seized; Su County Government Has Already Implemented Sealing and Confiscation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] Rice prices in the county have soared recently, now approaching 90,000 yuan. There is clearly a human factor involved. The public is extremely anxious and beyond words. County Magistrate Shen Chenglong suddenly received a secret report that unscrupulous grain merchants in Mudu were hoarding large quantities of rice to drive up prices. He dispatched officials to conduct on-site investigations yesterday and found that several rice shops in the town each hoarded at least 5,000 dan of rice, and even the town chief Gu Gensheng was hoarding a huge amount. The total amount reached more than 50,000 dan. Shen was greatly shocked and issued a hand order to Meng Junping, the district chief of Mudu, on the 8th, ordering him to work with the police station and the grain distribution office to seal up all the rice stored in the major rice shops and by Gu Gensheng, and to submit the account books for review. This decisive action is like a head-on blow to the unscrupulous grain merchants.</p>

<h3>Road Disputes Between Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou Dispatch] The Jinsiniang Bridge to Minhang section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road was completed by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction on October 10, 1932. At that time, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration leased it for operation. At the same time, the administration assigned the Jiaxing to Wangjiangjing section of the road to the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau for lease and operation, intending to exchange them. Recently, the Jiangsu Department of Construction intends to take back the Jin-Min Road for its own operation, while still not abandoning the operation of the Jiaxing to Wangjiangjing road. The Zhejiang Department of Construction therefore submitted historical evidence to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction yesterday, negotiating to take back the operating rights.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Negotiates Rice Prices; Medium-Grain Rice at 76,000</h3>

<h3>Kunshan Rumors of Conscription; Many Young Farmers Flee to Other Places; Authorities Refute Rumors and the Trend Has Subsided</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunshan Dispatch] In a few villages in the Zhangpu Qiandun area of the county, rumors of door-to-door conscription have been rampant recently.

Now, the grain merchants are allowed to extend the deadline for delivery to the warehouse until February 11. The breach of contract will be discussed at the next meeting. (2) Since the grain merchants have mortgaged grain for loans, a total of 1,030 shi of brown rice have been mortgaged. According to the decision of the first meeting, there is still a shortage of 970 shi. It seems difficult to meet the quota recently, so it is decided to postpone it temporarily. (3) The rice mortgaged to the association is stored in the Yongchang Rice Depot. The association should hire another administrator to be responsible for the management. (4) The 300 shi of brown rice stored in the association's warehouse will be processed into white rice first for long-term storage.</p>

<p>Sending Golden Buddha</p>
<p>It is reported that there are ten major crimes. Wang allegedly issued a handwritten order to the chiefs of the police stations to raise funds to purchase a golden Buddha to present as a birthday gift to a section chief in the Civil Affairs Department, but it was returned. However, after the return, the funds were not returned to the chiefs of the police stations and teams. At the same time, the Water Police Team extorted huge amounts of money from boatmen. After Chief Inspector Su investigated and found out the truth, he summoned and detained the illegal police chief of the team. Wang not only did not severely punish him, but released him, and shielded Fushan patrol officer Zhao Zinan's corruption case, among other charges.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin Offers Rewards for Arresting Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin Dispatch] The Huaiyin County Government, in order to eliminate remaining bandits and stabilize people's livelihood, has issued a notice to the public, rewarding those who report and capture senior cadres with evidence with 500,000 yuan in national currency, and other cadres with 100,000 yuan. In order to expedite the success, funds have been set aside. Furthermore, those who harbor bandits and conceal them without reporting will be treated as collaborators with the bandits. Each baojia chief is responsible for leading the people to investigate household registrations. If they know the situation but do not report it, they will be subject to joint and several punishment. However, they must not falsely accuse others out of personal grudges, which would result in counter-accusation.</p>

<h3>Why Not Demand Payment for Counterfeit Currency From the Enemy?</h3>
<p>Our national economy is facing a critical period. Instead of demanding the debt owed by the enemy, we are abandoning it. This debt is the Chu currency and Lian currency under the enemy's protection... The government should collect them all and exchange them with Japan. Has the government collected them? Why not have Japan redeem them? To rescue the Chinese economy? Our victorious country's legal tender has the responsibility to be exchanged externally. Why should Japan enjoy the fortune of "leniency and exemption from investigation"? Who is the victorious country and who is the defeated country between me and Japan? This confuses many intellectuals, causing the enemy's Chu and Lian... currencies to be used as fuel. Is this how we interpret returning good for evil?</p>
<p>The enemy's Chu and Lian... currencies in the hands of the common people were all earned through real rice grains and sweat. To allow them to be invalidated and used as fuel is to allow the enemy to safely enjoy the benefits. The government's lenient policy is being generous with other people's resources. I am afraid that no basis for this can be found in the Old and New Testaments, the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, or the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The government should collect Chu currency at a rate of 200 yuan per 1 yuan of legal tender and exchange it with Japan for cash to alleviate the urgent economic crisis in China. This business is not unreasonable, especially when the common people are facing starvation. The common people have no ability to cross the sea to seek redemption, nor do they have the right to negotiate with the enemy. The government has the responsibility to collect the redemption for the common people, but it seems to lack the ability. Please, government, show great compassion and make it convenient!</p>
<p>The Japanese government structure, except for the military, is exactly the same as before the war, and it is not as fragmented as Germany. Especially today's Japanese government is a government that fulfills its obligations to the victorious countries. If I present the counterfeit currency to him for redemption, he has no reason to refuse. Moreover, General MacArthur is stationed in Tokyo and will definitely assist my legitimate and justifiable demands. If my government willingly gives up and refuses to redeem it, Japan will naturally not come to China's door to pay this debt.</p>
<p>Or someone might say: "Japan's compensation for losses is in progress." This cannot be compared. Compensation for losses is a special obligation that the defeated country should bear and refers to the valuation of objects, which can be more or less. Counterfeit currency has a fixed amount, and the face value is fixed. Whether it is paid out or received is a commercial act, and there are international practices. The nature is different, so there is no need to make a fuss. Invoking the prestige of the victorious country, please consider it, government. Is it easier to hold Japan accountable for redemption?

<h3>Jingyuan Village Needs to Improve Sanitation</h3>
<p>I live in Jingyuan Village, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, this city. A few residents pay too little attention to public health. Garbage and night soil buckets are dumped anytime and anywhere, which is detrimental to sanitation. Please ask the Health Bureau to improve it quickly. (Wang Junhao)</p>

<h3>US Supports UN Organizations, Strongly Advocates Universal Military Training as Diplomatic Backup, Secretary of State Marshall Elaborates Policy</h3>
<p>[US News Agency Washington 7th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall stated at his first press conference today that he will follow the policies adopted by President Truman and former Secretary of State Byrnes to maintain strong US support for the United Nations and actively participate with all his might in drafting peace agreements.</p>
<p>Marshall, addressing over one hundred journalists, reiterated the US government's full support for the position taken by US Representative Austin on the disarmament issue at the Security Council on February 4. Marshall spoke for over thirty minutes before answering questions from reporters. The State Department revealed some of Marshall's statements as follows:</p>
<p>The policy of the President and Byrnes, and therefore my policy, is to do our utmost to accelerate and perfect the United Nations as a tool for discussing international issues and maintaining international peace, so as to extend our country's influence into international affairs. In addition, we will actively participate with all our might in drafting peace agreements, which will become the permanent foundation for the United Nations to fulfill its mission.</p>
<p>Senator Austin's statement on the disarmament issue at the Security Council on February 4, as he said, represents the thoroughly considered opinion of the US government. The goal we are pursuing is peace, with collective security as a reliable foundation. The US government will cooperate with other countries to achieve this goal as soon as possible. I believe this is the first step on the road to disarmament, and this road is neither short nor convenient.</p>
<p>International control of atomic energy and its effective safeguards are of utmost importance. In the general sense, this is not a question of military reduction. Once this extremely destructive force is not controlled, it will be difficult for mankind to feel safe for even a day. This is why we attach the utmost importance to solving this problem. Reaching solutions to all major peace issues that are acceptable to all major powers is also necessary to establish true security. Before finding these solutions, it is difficult to hope for any true disarmament, or even any actual reduction in armaments. I firmly believe that the US government will carefully avoid repeating the tragedy of unilateral disarmament and arms limitation after 1921. The issue of disarmament cannot be resolved emotionally. Today, we should resolve it through practical means.</p>
<p>Marshall also strongly emphasized that the United States will never reduce its military strength until a collective security system is established, and that universal military training must be implemented to support US foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, US Delegation Members, Murphy and Clay Will Accompany</h3>
<p>Regarding the selection of US representatives to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Marshall stated that the selection of my entourage will be very similar to the selection of Secretary of State Byrnes' entourage at the New York and Paris Foreign Ministers' Conferences. In other words, it can be said that I will be accompanied by the same team. I hope that my deputy will be Mr. Murphy, and General Clay is also expected to become an advisor to the US delegation. Senators Vandenberg and Connally have declared their positions and have consulted with me for a long time beforehand. I thoroughly understand their positions and fully listen to their support for the general points of bipartisan foreign policy. The Soviet Embassy has formally notified us that the number of journalists to be received by the Soviet side will be limited to fifteen to twenty. We are now requesting the Soviet government to increase this number. We are also trying to obtain broadcast equipment for journalists. I previously discussed this issue with Molotov, and Ambassador Smith previously expressed his views on the issue of allowing broadcasting. A total of seventy-three journalists have applied to go to Moscow, but since there is a selection issue, the State Department cannot select all applicants.</p>
<p>Palestinian Situation, US Expresses Deep Concern</p>
<p>Regarding the Palestine issue, Marshall said that the United States is fully familiar with the various discussions in London, and the US government only hopes that all parties will reach a unanimous solution. The United States is extremely concerned about the situation in Palestine. Marshall also said that he does not believe that the British side has any plans to adopt a tough military strategy in Palestine.</p>
<p>Trusteeship of Former Japanese Mandated Islands, Plan Unchanged</p>
<p>Regarding the Pacific trust territory islands, Marshall mentioned President Truman's statement on November 6 last year, which stated that the United States would formally submit to the Security Council as soon as possible a draft strategic trusteeship agreement regarding the former Japanese mandated islands. Marshall said that US Representative Austin is expected to deliver this agreement to the Security Council around February 17. Marshall continued to say that although the governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia have made suggestions, all parties do not oppose this proposal by the United States. The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia all believe that this issue should be left for discussion after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. Marshall said that the US government believes that this matter should not be delayed, but if the Security Council decides to extend the discussion on this matter after the US proposal is formally submitted, the US government is still willing to consider extending the discussion on this matter. Marshall pointed out that the US proposal for strategic trusteeship of these Pacific trust territory islands is fully in line with the trusteeship provisions of the United Nations Charter. According to the Charter, the trusteeship agreement should be submitted to the Security Council rather than to the United Nations General Assembly because the islands are strategic areas.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with Polish Election, Retains Freedom of Action</p>
<p>Marshall continued to say that my government's position on the recent Polish elections has been fully clarified in the statement issued by the State Department on January 28. My government intends to continue to closely monitor the situation in Poland. My government is extremely concerned about the welfare of the Polish people and will retain the freedom of action to determine its future attitude towards the Polish government and will continue to obtain information on all developments in Poland from the diplomatic mission in Warsaw. "To this end, the US Ambassador to Poland is expected to return home in the near future to consult with the State Department so that the State Department can receive a preliminary report on recent developments."</p>
<h3>Differences Between US and Soviet Views, Disarmament Subcommittee Meeting Fails</h3>
<p>[Associated Press New York 7th Dispatch] The Security Council's six-nation subcommittee discussed the organizational rules of the Zhulai Military Commission. Due to the differences between the US and Soviet views, which could not be reconciled, it has been abandoned today. After three days of secret discussions, the representatives believed that continued efforts would be of no avail, and finally decided to return two draft proposals to the Security Council for handling, one including the Soviet view and the other the US position. The subcommittee believes that the dispute between the two sides is clearly a matter of principle and therefore cannot be compromised. The Security Council will re-discuss this matter at a public meeting around next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pan-American Defense</p>
<p>Regarding Latin America, Marshall said that the long-delayed Rio de Janeiro conference will be convened immediately to study the Western Hemisphere defense plan with the Latin American countries. The United States has not changed its attitude towards the Argentine government and still requires the Perón government to eliminate the Nazis.</p>
<p>US-Philippine Negotiations</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of US bases in the Philippines, the Secretary of State said that he has received reports that the relevant discussions are continuing in a friendly spirit and that there are no particular difficulties.</p>
<p>Regarding the joint statement of Senators Vandenberg and Millikin regarding the Commercial Act, Marshall said that the statement shows that Congress has cooperated with the State Department and that economic affairs, like world political affairs, have also achieved bipartisan cooperation. Italy Prepares to Stop Work to Commemorate National Humiliation</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Expresses Intention to Refuse to Sign Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>Italy Prepares to Stop Work to Commemorate National Humiliation</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris 7th Dispatch] The peace treaty for the five defeated countries is scheduled to be signed here on the 10th. A Yugoslav spokesman reiterated today that the country intends to refuse to sign. At the same time, the General Confederation of Labor in Rome called on the entire country to stop work for ten minutes at 11:00 AM on the 10th, the hour of signing the peace treaty with Italy, to commemorate national humiliation.</p>
<h3>Deep Friction Between US and Soviet Union, Pessimistic About Foreign Ministers' Conference, Soviet Union May Make Astonishing Proposals on German Issue</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 7th Dispatch] The Moscow Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to be held next month, but before the conference opens, there are many difficulties between the United States and the Soviet Union, which are increasing rather than decreasing. Secretary of State Marshall is studying the various issues to be discussed at the Moscow conference, and the accumulating differences between the two countries will have a great impact on the trend of the conference. The following facts are sufficient to hinder the feelings between the two countries: (1) The United States has sent a note to the Soviet Union requesting negotiations on the final settlement of materials borrowed under the Lend-Lease Act, but the Soviet Union has ignored it. (2) The US government requested that it take concerted action with the UK and the Soviet Union to enable Poland to hold free elections, but the Soviet Union has refused. The United States believes that the Soviet Union's move violates the Potsdam Agreement, and Marshall may raise this issue at the Moscow conference. (3) The United States sent a note to the Soviet Union urging it to consult with China on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Dalian and return civil administration to China, but the Soviet Union ignored it. (4) According to reports from Washington, the United States requested to send well-known professors and others with cultural missions to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union often ignored them. The United States eagerly invited Soviet personnel to the United States, but the Soviet Union responded with indifference. (5) Many American people suffered war damage in Eastern Europe. The State Department wants to obtain reports on personal and property aspects, but the Soviet authorities remain silent. In addition to the above-mentioned special stimuli, conflicts continue to occur between the Soviet Union and the Western powers in the United Nations organizations and in every region where British and American leaders want to stop Soviet expansion, such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the Spitsbergen Islands. Some diplomats believe that the Soviet strategy may be to put forward astonishing proposals at the beginning of the Moscow conference, which may have the greatest propaganda effect on the German people. The Soviet Union will instigate the construction of a centralized and powerful German government, while the United States wants Germany to adopt a federal system, making the power of the central government weaker. This point has been almost determined. The Soviet Union may even put forward a request, advocating that the four powers withdraw from Germany uniformly and return it to the Germans as soon as possible. Although there is currently no such evidence, American policymakers will never ignore its possibility.</p>
<h3>The Former Japanese Mandated Islands are Managed by the United States</h3>
<p>I Principally Express Support</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 8th Dispatch] Regarding the disposition of the Japanese mandated territories, since the US side announced its intention to submit it to the Security Council and designate it as a military trust territory managed by the United States, it has aroused discussions among the United Nations. Some have argued that this matter must be resolved in the peace conference with Japan. The reporter inquired with the Chinese government and learned that the Chinese government has now received the US draft, and the Chinese government will principally agree with the trusteeship method proposed by the US side. As to whether this matter should be resolved at the same time as the Japanese and other territorial issues at the peace conference with Japan, it is only a matter of procedure and is not very important. In addition, regarding the future peace conference with Japan, China will advocate that the venue should be selected within the Pacific coastal countries region.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York 7th Special Telegram] According to the New York Herald Tribune: Although the United Kingdom does not oppose but rather supports the US request to make the former Japanese mandated islands a "strategic" trust territory, it requests that the "open door" principle, which the United States often advocates, be applied to the above-mentioned islands. The UK has submitted a note to the US Department of State, arguing that any laws and regulations that the United States intends to formulate for the above-mentioned islands should be discussed in the negotiations on the peace with Japan before taking action.</p>

<h3>The Helgoland Fortress in the North Sea Will Be Completely Destroyed by Bombing</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hamburg 7th Dispatch] Heligoland Island in the North Sea, which was used by the German army as a strong naval base in the two world wars, has been planted with 6,700 tons of explosives to completely destroy its fortress equipment. The explosives are buried within the 18-mile land angle of the island and are tentatively scheduled to explode on March 31. British warships will be berthed at least eight miles from the island to detonate the explosives with electric wires. The residents of the island, which is 30 miles from the German coast, have already been evacuated. The four seaports of the island can be used as fishing ports and will not be destroyed by bombing.</p>
<h3>Greek Left and Right Wings Demonstrate, Investigation Team Decides to Maintain an Impartial Position</h3>
<p>[Reuters Athens 7th Dispatch] Thousands of Greek left-wing elements demonstrated in front of the office of the United Nations investigation team today, demanding that British troops withdraw from Greece, that the death sentences be not carried out, and that fleeing political prisoners be allowed to return to the country. The investigation team was holding a secret meeting at the time. Colonel Longte, the secretary-general of the team, appeared on the balcony and assured that the team would soon listen to the opinions of the representatives of the Greek left-wing group Liberation Front. The crowd cheered and dispersed. Afterwards, right-wing elements held a counter-demonstration, chanting slogans such as "Long live the King." The police did not interfere with either demonstration, only preventing clashes between the two factions.</p>
<h3>England's National Coal Shortage is Severe; Power Outages Severely Impact National Economy; Severe European Winter is the Main Cause of Coal Shortage</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Fuel Minister Shinwell announced in Parliament yesterday: Due to fuel shortages, all industries in London, southeastern England, central England, and northeastern England will have their electricity supply cut off starting Monday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] The British government announced today that it would conserve electricity, which was expected due to the coal shortage. The government ordered all factories in industrial areas across the country to implement power saving measures starting from the 10th of this month. A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said that industrial stagnation would lead to the unemployment of four million workers, while millions of households would also be affected, with household electricity consumption reduced to five hours per day. The spokesperson also said that the economic chaos in the future could be comparable to the shortage of gas ten years ago. Conservative newspapers hinted that the Labour government would be forced to form a coalition government to resolve the crisis. Labour figures dismissed this as "Conservative wishful thinking." Fuel and Electricity Minister Shinwell faced questioning from both Labour and Conservative members of Parliament when he announced the above drastic measures in the House of Commons today. Shinwell said that the government had decided to stop supplying industrial electricity to London and the southeast, northwest, and central regions starting from the 10th, and household users would be prohibited from using electricity from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Shinwell hoped that the blackout would not last for three or four days, at most a week. The day the power saving order was issued, London experienced a severe cold that had not been seen for many years, and most residents relied on electricity for heating. The cold wave had lasted for a month, and the suffering was the worst in ten years. Currently, the ground is covered with snow, and the temperature is below freezing. The areas Shinwell pointed out for power outages, such as London, Birmingham, and Manchester, are all the most thriving industrial areas in Britain. A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said: "British production has been wiped out." The spokesperson predicted that all cotton mills and automobile factories would be shut down. The machine industry is likely to come to a complete standstill. Half of the rayon industry and electricity-using industries will also be shut down. Hundreds of ocean liners are also blocked in ports due to high costs, export bans, and coal loading bans. This ban applies to both domestic and foreign ships, and it is estimated that no less than 700 ships are affected.</p>
<h3>British King Sails in Ship, Approaching the Equator</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] Princess Elizabeth and Princess Rose of Britain are traveling with their father and mother on the battleship "Vanguard" on a tour of South Africa and will cross the equator on the 10th of this month. According to custom, those who cross the equator for the first time must have their heads washed and bathe in cold water, but the two princesses, with their royal status, may not be bound by custom. According to a telegram from the "Vanguard," the ship has traveled 2,000 miles, and the two princesses will participate in the ship's immersion ceremony with others, but they will not enter the water.</p>

<h3>Telegram Exchanges Between Britain and the Soviet Union; Exchanging Opinions on the Alliance</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] Marshal Stalin and British Foreign Secretary Bevin have been exchanging telegrams recently. According to government officials, the opinions they exchanged are related to the British-Soviet alliance. Furthermore, with the opening of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow imminent, Foreign Secretary Bevin is about to depart for Moscow. When Bevin meets with Marshal Stalin, this exchange of views can be seen as a prelude to their meeting, with the common goal of making the British-Soviet alliance suitable for the current environment.</p>
<h3>The Palestine Problem: Britain Proposes a Compromise Plan; Arabs and Jews Hold Conflicting Views</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] The British government has today presented a compromise plan for resolving the Palestine problem to Arab leaders. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Arab representative, Mr. Gululai, stated that if this proposal allows even one more Jew to enter Palestine, it would be tantamount to declaring war. The compromise plan appears to have been submitted to the Jewish delegation on the same day. According to Mr. Hesseni, head of the Arab delegation, the country has decided not to read the contents of the proposal until tomorrow morning because "I am sure that reading it will keep me up all night." Mr. Hesseni's remarks suggest that he has heard that the new proposal still advocates the immediate transfer of 100,000 Jews from European refugee camps to the Palestinian Jewish area. At the same time, British Colonial Secretary Jones convened an ad hoc meeting tonight with Mr. Hiddock, head of the Political Department of the Jewish Congress, to discuss the situation in Palestine. It is reported that Jones warned Hiddock that if serious riots occur again in Palestine after the British proposal is announced, the British army will take the initiative. The compromise proposal was submitted to the Cabinet by Jones, advocating allowing Jews to immigrate to Palestine without any limit on the number. Foreign Secretary Bevin, on the other hand, believes that unlimited immigration of Jews would provoke an anti-British "holy war" among the Arabs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Although Jewish and Arab representatives are scheduled to hold separate meetings today to discuss the British government's new plan for Palestine, it is expected that neither group will accept it. Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamali, a spokesperson for the Arab delegation, reiterated that the Arabs will never accept any plan that allows Jews to immigrate or assigns part of Palestinian land to Jewish rule, while the Jewish Association expressed dissatisfaction for not obtaining a suitable area of land to establish a Jewish state.</p>
<h3>Americans Look at the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by this Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>The Soviet government, the Soviet state, and the Soviet people are three distinct things that should be distinguished. Americans should be hostile to the Soviet government at present, neutral toward the Soviet state, but the Soviet people should be friends of America.</p>
<p>American goodwill toward the Soviet Union reached its peak in 1945, but has gradually declined since then: this is what American public opinion polls tell us. The results of the 1946 public opinion polls showed that 62 percent of Americans admitted that their feelings toward the Soviet Union were not as friendly as they had been a year before.</p>
<p>Americans' Goodwill Towards the Soviet Union Decreases</p>
<p>During this year, the Soviet Union restricted political freedom in Eastern Europe, incited riots in Yizhou, plundered materials from the nine northeastern provinces of China, and delivered lengthy and abusive speeches in Paris. Therefore, it is not surprising that American goodwill toward the Soviet Union has decreased. This can be regarded as progress in Americans' understanding of world affairs, but this progress is not very long, and if it is allowed to stay there, it may turn into regression. Because it is very naive to confuse the country and the people in this way and arbitrarily divide them into friendly and unfriendly. Each country has its own characteristics, just like the personality of a person, but it is not that simple. To correct the distortion of American public opinion about the Soviet Union, we must understand what we like and dislike about the Soviet Union, what we are worried about, and what we hope for?</p>
<p>We should distinguish between three important things: the Soviet government, the Soviet state, and the Soviet people. Americans should be hostile to the Soviet government at present, neutral toward the Soviet state, but the Soviet people should be friends of America.</p>
<p>Soviet Policy Hinders Friendship</p>
<p>The autocratic politics of the Soviet government are more extensive than those of the Russian era. The political system of other countries is not our business, but we, as the American people, can curse the methods and principles adopted by this government. Two Soviet policies have repeatedly hindered the development of genuine peace between the United States and the Soviet Union. The first is communism's salvation of the world, which has unnecessarily strengthened the conflict between our national ideas and those of the Soviet Union. The second is the isolationism of the Communist Party, which has put an iron curtain between the Soviet and American nations.</p>
<p>Since 1939, the Soviet Union has annexed 274,000 square miles of land in Europe and Asia, and has brought eight independent countries into its sphere of influence. Almost all of these annexed lands were owned by Russia before 1918, and most of the new sphere of influence countries were controlled or coveted by the Russian emperors of the past. This is not only the expansion of the Soviet Union itself, but also a salvational dream, which its prophet Lenin made most clear. He wants to overthrow capitalism all over the world. Who declared this "sacred" war? Not the Soviet Union, but a few fanatical politicians. The Soviet Union is their tool, just as foreign Communist parties are tools of the Soviet Union. In order to safeguard human freedom, the United States has to resist the spread of communism, so we have to resist the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Censorship Becomes Even More Serious</p>
<p>But what is worse is the Soviet government's policy of isolating its people. The current Soviet censorship system is even more serious than during the war, which is not what the Soviet people think. Although the Soviet people frankly envy the wealth of the United States, they can be proud of their achievements in working hard for 25 years. Their natural feelings for the United States are a friendly and unfulfilled curiosity. When Ehrenburg gave a speech in Moscow last month about his impressions of his trip to the United States, the audience was packed and listened attentively for two hours.</p>
<p>The Russian People Have Many Virtues</p>
<p>Throughout history, the patriotism of the Russian people has been stirred to its climax by a vague ideal. This is tantamount to drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. Occasionally, when the economic situation improves a little, like the period of booming consumer goods from 1933 to 1936, the Soviet people happily ate that "cake." They have always dreamed of the era of harmony during the war: more houses, more "culture" - cultural bathrooms, cultural fountain pens, cultural ice cream, these are the things the Soviet people need.</p>
<p>But in order to enrich and supply the new prisoners in the concentration camps, the consumer goods industry had to stagnate again. However, the Soviet people love freedom and love their compatriots with a passion that is almost unparalleled by the people of other countries. They gather together at every turn, but they do not act barbarously; although they are poor, they are not beggars. They are unfortunately victims of a certain system, and their only weapon to deal with this system is patience and benevolence. They want us to trust them. I hope we will not answer their expectations with anger or ridicule again. (Abridged translation from the American magazine "Life")</p>
<h3>Burmese Anti-British Faction Organizes United Front</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London broadcast on the day. The Burmese opposition, which opposes the British-promoted plan for Burmese independence, is scheduled to hold a congress tomorrow to organize a united front to resist the British plan. It is expected that large-scale actions will take place in Burma before the Burmese constitutional assembly elections (April).</p>
<h3>Japanese Youth Attempts to Assassinate Yoshida</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] The Japanese police recently arrested a young thief named Kawakawa, 25 years old. According to his confession, he had conspired to assassinate Prime Minister Yoshida, and there were ten accomplices, three of whom were residents of Tokyo.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Political Situation is Unstable; Calls for a Coalition Cabinet Rise Again; MacArthur's Order</h3>
<p>[Gaizo-sha, Tokyo, 8th] At the end of last month, when 8.6 million Japanese people were brewing a general strike, the Yoshida Cabinet was in danger. MacArthur's order prohibiting the strike brought it back to life. After Yoshida received a strong shot in the arm, he immediately implemented a partial cabinet reshuffle. However, because the reshuffle still did not have the certainty of overcoming the labor offensive and the economic crisis, he still revealed his intention to organize a coalition cabinet and seized the opportunity to win over the Socialist Party to join the cabinet. Over the past week, the Progressive Party has been extremely dissatisfied with the reshuffled cabinet and has actively appealed to the Liberal and Socialist parties to organize a coalition cabinet. However, because the Liberal Party's attitude was negative and the Socialist Party's attitude was cautious, the second and third leaders' meetings ultimately failed to materialize, and the political situation remained unstable. The date for the resumption of parliament is approaching. Just as Yoshida was at a loss, MacArthur sent a letter to Yoshida, instructing him to hold a general election after completing his mission in the Diet. Yoshida also received strong support for this, because the Diet still needs three months to complete its mission, and he has at least obtained a guarantee to extend the life of the cabinet for three months. Within these three months, Yoshida will carefully arrange the conservative camp and strengthen the unity between the Liberal and Progressive parties in order to compete with the powerful Socialist Party in the general election.</p>
<p>However, the undercurrents in the Japanese political situation are still extremely complex at this moment. The Liberal Party decided yesterday to abandon the work of organizing a "coalition cabinet," but the Progressive Party today still insisted on establishing a "national salvation regime," the ultimate goal of which is to unite all factions and expel Yoshida. At the same time, the movement within the Liberal Party to expel Yoshida as president has also emerged, which is quite noteworthy. Although Yoshida has abandoned the idea of organizing a coalition cabinet, the cabinet will be in extreme danger if the Progressive Party's work is successful.</p>

<h3>"Four Famous Mountains" Bandit Gang Comes to Shanghai; Stealing Important People's Property Repeatedly; Impersonating Air Force Officers</h3>
<p>The Chongqing US Dollar Market Theft Case is Finally Revealed Today</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, the "Four Famous Mountains" bandit gang, which ran rampant in southwestern China, stole 30,000 US dollars in American dollar bills from Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan, in the US dollar market on Shaanxi Street in Chongqing in the spring of the 30th year. Although the military and police authorities in Chongqing conducted a thorough investigation afterward, they were eventually missed due to their exceptional cunning. After the victory, Liu Nanzhu, the "Chief of Staff" of the "Four Famous Mountains," under the pseudonym Zhang Xi, also known as Liu Hangxia, actually transformed himself into an Air Force officer and operated on the Beijing-Shanghai line, committing many crimes one after another. Among them, the most outstanding ones were: one was Ms. Shen Dianzhong, who lived at 598 Weihaiwei Road in this city, and was stolen 3 million legal tender, gold jewelry, and land deeds. Ms. Shen is the daughter of Shen Yixueyi, secretary of a certain agency in Nanshi. The other was that recently, when Zhang Dongshen, the Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, went to Beijing from Shanghai, he had a suitcase containing "Opinions on the Current Situation" to be presented to the Chairman, which was stolen in the crowd at the ticket office of the North Station, causing Zhang to postpone his trip temporarily and issue a statement. Unexpectedly, this large-scale theft was finally captured by the Railway Bureau Police Department at 8:20 PM on the 30th of last month in the third-class carriage of the Beijing-Shanghai Tenth Express. At the same time, another "Four Famous Mountains" bandit, the mute Zhang Zhiqing, and his assistant Liu Huaide, were also arrested in Vienna Dance Hall and other places. A large number of forged Air Force documents, travel permits, and fake Victory Medals were seized one after another. After interrogation, they have confessed to the crimes and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for questioning tomorrow.</p>
<p>Stealing in the Carriage, Arrested After Being Discovered</p>
<p>As for the process of solving the case, it was due to the fact that at 8:20 PM on January 30th this year, a passenger named Yang Jingwei in the third-class carriage of the tenth express had his cotton robe cut with a blade. It was discovered that the young military officer standing next to him was highly suspected, and there was also proof from a third party, Chen Shaoquan. Therefore, the on-duty police officer No. 984 took the case. After questioning by Xu Ying, the director of the Eighth Sub-precinct, the defendant claimed to be Liu Hangxia, 211 years old, from Beiping, and currently a flight staff officer of the First Brigade of the Fifth Military Region of the Air Force, transferred from India to Taipei. The suspect was fully equipped with an American Air Force uniform, wearing a flight badge, Victory Medal, wrist strap, and other items, and presented a set of Air Force travel permits. The report was made with the character Si No. 5, and transferred to the section on January 31. After the person in charge of the case interrogated him strictly according to the law, the defendant was evasive. Because his words were hesitant and there was no room for argument, he finally admitted that he had been picking pockets for a living, and had traveled from the inland to Shen. On December 10, 35, he formed a group with accomplices Liu Huaide, Zhang Zhiqing, and Luo Tiexiong, Liu Jinshan, and Xiao Luo (etc.) impersonating Air Force officers, opening rooms at the Royal Hotel No. 216 Wujin Road, the New World Hotel No. 257 Nanjing Road, and the Dashing Hotel No. 313 Zhejiang Road in this city, hiding and sharing the loot, and distributing his accomplices in the four major companies of Longhua Airport in this city and on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line to perform their skills in picking pockets. Dozens of cases have been committed one after another.</p>
<p>Mute Dancer is Actually an Accomplice</p>
<p>The Police Department, together with the Old Zhabei and New Cheng District Bureaus, captured one of his accomplices, Zhang Zhiqing (the suspect is mute, so interrogation is very difficult) in the Vienna Dance Hall on January 31st and February 1st. A wrist strap was also found, and he confessed that he was indeed a thief. Another suspect, Liu Huaide, was found in room 313 of the Dashing Hotel on Zhejiang Road, and 20 blank travel permits with the Air Force seal, as well as Air Force epaulettes and collar badges, were found. He confessed that he and the first defendant, Liu Hangxia, were accomplices in picking pockets.</p>
<p>Going East Along the Current, Stealing All the Way</p>
<p>According to Liu's confession, during the Anti-Japanese War, he and his accomplices Li Benchu and Hu Fei stole 30,000 US dollars from the US dollar market on Shaanxi Street in Chongqing. He received 8,000 yuan. Because the circumstances of the case were serious, the security organs in Chongqing attached great importance to it and strictly arrested the pickpockets. Seeing the urgency, he could not stand in Chongqing and secretly took the Minben wheel of the Minsheng Company to Wanxian, and then transferred to Guiyang, Kunming, Chengdu and other places, still stealing while moving. After the victory, he stole all the way east along the various ports. He arrived in Shanghai on December 10 last year, first living in the Royal Hotel, then moving to the New World Hotel. More than a month later, he moved to the Dashing Hotel again. This time, he was arrested for working with Luo Tiexiong (i.e., Da Luo) to steal at the station and on the train.</p>
<p>Thieves are Also Romantic and Like Women</p>
<p>The main culprit Liu Hangxia, who was arrested this time, was young and romantic. Two photos were copied, one of a popular dancer, Xuezhen, from the Da Shanghai Dance Hall in this city, and the other was given by the singer Lu Ping. According to Liu's confession, whenever they went to a place, they would first form relationships with local dancers, singers, female students, and even female celebrities. There were hundreds of people who had physical relationships with him. The other three members of the "Four Famous Mountains" were also like this, and all the money they had stolen over the years was spent on women.</p>
<p>Also, all the stolen goods seized this time have been listed on the list, including a blade, a set of American Air Force uniforms, two fake flight badges, one fake Victory Medal, one fake Air Force travel permit, twenty forged Air Force travel permits, two fake Air Force collar badges, one epaulette, one paper of "Notes for Returnees Staying in Shanghai," and 50 cards printed with "Liu Hangxia, Staff Officer of the Third Squadron of the First Brigade of the Fifth Military Region of the Air Force," one Royal Hotel bill, and one forged Air Force Flight Staff Officer Liu Hangxia travel permit (the above is Liu Hangxia's part). There are also two silver wrist straps, a notebook, a piece of stationery with the seal of the Political Department of the 75th Army, and a travel permit from the 75th Army.</p>

<h3>Five-Person Investigation Committee Continues to Visit Fire Department; Observation Tower Staff Lament Miserable Situation; Whole Body in Tatters, Empty Stomach</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Ke Xin, chairman of the five-person investigation committee for the Seymour Road fire, Zhang Da, and others, continued to visit the fire department at 2 PM yesterday and compared the official fire department in the city center with the private fire department in Nanshi. Those who appeared at the Yichang Road Fire Department were still wearing rotten raincoats and broken leather boots. When the firefighters saw reporters, they were mostly full of complaints. They said, "For several years, all they have is a tattered uniform. When they return from fighting a fire, they are soaked all over, but they have no way to change their clothes. The old French Concession's water equipment has long been abandoned, so they are both frozen and hungry, and their suffering is incomparable." They also handed Director Ke a letter, asking him to forward it to the City Council for appeal. Old firefighter No. 446 also said: For the past fifteen years, he has been sitting high on the observation tower for six hours every night, inspecting the surrounding fires so that he can inform the control room at any time and give rescue measures quickly. His mission is indeed very sacred, but what he gets in return is a body in tatters and an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Female Flow Goes to the Fire Site, Team Captain Zhuo Denies</p>
<p>In addition to hosting the Investigation Committee's visit to the New Police Training Center's performance, Team Captain Zhuo Houdao refuted the "Fire Department Lady" section published in various newspapers a few days ago. He said: "The speed of the fire truck is so fast that even new fire police officers cannot stand firm, let alone women. And the temperature that day was below zero, and it was raining heavily. What is the purpose of a woman taking a fire truck to the fire site?" The team captain also said: "Since the Seymour Road incident, all walks of life have severely criticized the firefighters. It can be said that they are covered in wounds. However, although there are one or two unscrupulous people among the firefighters, not everyone is like this. Therefore, those who know how to protect themselves are expressing their weariness." Ke Xin, chairman of the Investigation Committee, realized the seriousness of the situation and specifically stated that when the investigation of the Seymour Road fire case comes to an end, he intends to ask the mayor to summon all the firefighters for a speech to encourage them and improve their morale.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Fire Brigade - Member Obligations</h3>
<p>The special committee and others have visited various fire stations in the Nanshi area. The Nanshi fire stations are privately operated and divided into six districts: Southeast, Northwest, Central, and Dongjiadu. During the Anti-Japanese War, the East district was demolished by the enemy, the South district was bombed, and the West district was partially preserved due to its relocation to the former French Concession. Only the Central and North districts remained unscathed because they were included in the refugee zone. The Nanshi Fire Brigade was founded in the 30th year of the Guangxu era (1904), and its funding relies entirely on donations from merchants and residents, but it is not mandatory. Currently, the Nanshi Fire Brigade has a small number of personnel, including 14 firefighters and 10 staff members, while volunteer members account for as many as 80. The salaries of the firefighters are not high, ranging from 110,000 to 200,000, but most of the members are semi-volunteer, so they have no complaints. Moreover, when the alarm bell rings, volunteer members immediately prepare upon hearing the sound to continue the dispatch. The destroyed East District Fire Brigade is actively being repaired, and once the reorganization is complete, various sectors will be invited to visit.</p>
<h3>Because There Are Too Many Bureaucratic Processes, Firefighting Is Also Affected; Whether Government-Run or Private, Money Is Key</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ge Kexin, the director of the Fire Investigation Committee, inquired about the advantages and disadvantages of government-run versus private fire stations when he visited the Nanshi private fire station yesterday. Mao Jing, the standing committee member of the Shanghai Hunan District Fire Brigade Federation, replied, "If there is money, both government-run and private are good. Without money, neither the government nor private can do well." Hua Nianzhu, the captain of the district team, also humorously replied, "Private operations can save a lot of paperwork," implying criticism of the government's excessive bureaucracy. Mao also reported that when Wu Tiecheng was the Mayor of Shanghai, he suggested unifying the Nanshi fire stations and having the government bear the expenses. Mao opposed this at the time because the procedures for receiving funds were too cumbersome. Mao also said, "The problem of 'waiting for approvals'" has been the same since ancient times and is even more severe today. Therefore, reforms must be implemented to save manpower and resources. They did not want to make any specific criticisms of government-run fire stations, but they only suggested that more volunteer members should be hired, which could serve as a general model and improve work efficiency. Zhou Zhaoxiang, the director of the fire station, also felt a headache about the current cumbersome official procedures. He told the reporter that even buying a single screw requires submitting a written request, then investigating, estimating the price, stamping seals, and going through numerous approvals, which takes at least half a month. Therefore, Director Zhou will raise this issue in the City Council, requesting an additional several million yuan in revolving funds for operations.</p>
<h3>Excavation of the Fire Site to Be Completed Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The excavation of the Wang family's fire site yesterday resulted in the discovery of a silver treasure sword, two seals, a silver teapot lid, five box keys, eleven locks, fourteen copper rings, four hinges, five silver hinges, two silver cups, two silver dollars, and the empty setting of a diamond ring, indicating that the original diamond must have been very large. All the excavated items have been handed over to Miss Wang Yunfu and Wang Chuiling. The excavation of the fire site will continue today and is scheduled to be completed tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Administration Releases Report on Christmas Three-Plane Accident; Severe Weather Deterioration Was the Main Cause of the Accidents; Personnel Deemed to Have Done Their Utmost</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' Civil Aviation Administration recently released a report on the plane crashes of Central China Airlines and China National Aviation Corporation on December 25th last year. The full text is over 5,000 words long, detailing the accidents of Central Company's No. 48 aircraft and China Company's No. 140 and No. 115 aircraft, as well as 12 attachments. The report concludes that the severe deterioration of the weather was the main cause of the three accidents. The overall civil aviation facilities in our country have not yet reached the ideal state. For more than ten years, the country's financial resources have been stretched, and all equipment has relied on foreign countries due to the backwardness of our domestic industry. Although there have been detailed plans for civil aviation airports and other flight facilities over the years, they have not been fully implemented due to factual and environmental limitations. Airlines are even less capable, and their inherent weaknesses are self-evident. Since the victory, ground transportation has been hindered, and the need for air transport has surged. The businesses of China National Aviation Corporation and Central China Airlines have been forced to make every effort to meet the demand. However, the inherently weak civil aviation facilities could not keep up with the need, leading to safety issues during flights in severely changing weather. Regarding the weather forecasting, aircraft communication, and management of various flight control technologies on the day of the three accidents, the Administration's detailed investigation concluded that, based on the existing equipment of the companies and the circumstances at the time, personnel at all levels were able to act cautiously, quickly respond, and make their best and greatest efforts without dereliction of duty. Based on this judgment, the only way to achieve reasonable development and safety guarantees for the civil aviation industry in the future is to rapidly improve navigation equipment and strive for accurate weather forecasting to remedy and improve the situation. The severity of the unfortunate incidents that occurred was unprecedented in the history of civil aviation in our country. The Administration, since its inception, has a duty to strive for improvement and development.</p>
<h3>Two British Aircraft Arrive in Shanghai, Carrying Back UNRRA Sailors</h3>
<p>Two British civil aviation aircraft flew from Hankou to Shanghai yesterday, landing at Longhua Airport. It is understood that the aircraft are chartered by UNRRA because a batch of fishing boats from Hankou are currently being used by UNRRA, and most of the sailors on board are Australians. Therefore, two aircraft were specially chartered to take them back to their homeland. One aircraft is scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning, and the other will fly to Australia tomorrow. The flight route remains the same, via Hong Kong, Manila, and then south.</p>
<h3>Unlawful Public Official from Huoqiu Flees to Shanghai and Is Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A field manager from Huoqiu County, Anhui Province, took advantage of his position to embezzle 9,000 catties of rice and fled to Shanghai. After the incident, the Anhui Provincial Government sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting his arrest. The Putuo Road Police Station recently arrested Guan. He was transferred to the District Procuratorate yesterday.</p>

<h3>Prosecutor Investigates Cause of China National Aviation Corporation Plane Crash in Tianmen; Aviation Group Denies Smuggling Gold; Officials Express Dissatisfaction with Staff's Arrogant Attitude; Awaiting Company Investigation Report</h3>
<p>Awaiting Company Investigation Report</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The repeated plane crashes recently have attracted great attention from the authorities. As the location of the headquarters of China National Aviation Corporation and Central China Airlines, the Shanghai District Court is particularly concerned about the repeated plane crashes. On the 28th of this month, the crash of China National Aviation Corporation's No. 145 Shanghai-Chongqing passenger plane in Tianmen County, Western Hubei, was particularly puzzling because the weather was good that day and there were no mountains at the crash site. It was rumored that the plane's wings were secretly carrying 200 gold bars, causing the plane to lose balance and crash. Others claimed that someone conspired to sabotage the plane by loosening screws in one or two important places before takeoff, causing mechanical failure and leading to the crash after a short flight. The District Procuratorate attached great importance to the case and specially dispatched prosecutors Zhu Xiyu and Liu Yongzhi to visit China National Aviation Corporation. The General Manager of the company, Shen Debian, was out, and the Chief Secretary Liang Jingzhao received them. According to Liang, after the No. 145 crash, the company had sent the Business Director Shang Dajing to Hankou to investigate the cause of the crash. The official report is expected to arrive in Shanghai within two or three days. The prosecutors then met with senior officials of the company's aviation group, including Director Wu Shi, Deputy Director Chen Hongen, and Assistant Wang. Wu Shi stated that even if there were 70 kilograms of gold being smuggled, it would not cause the plane to crash, as there were only 23 passengers, one captain, one co-pilot, and one telegraph operator on the plane, and the load would not exceed the limit. Regarding the theory of screws being removed or loosened, he also said that this was impossible, as the aircraft parts must be inspected before takeoff, and no damage was found. He also presented the aircraft's pre-flight inspection report to prove that the aircraft parts were in good condition before takeoff. At the same time, he solemnly denied the rumors of smuggling gold bars and guaranteed that this was not the case. He speculated that there were three possible causes of the crash: (1) severe weather, (2) mechanical failure in flight, (3) incorrect judgment of weather, flight routes, etc. by the pilot. The prosecutors then inspected Longhua Airport and examined the structure of the aircraft wings, returning late in the evening. Yesterday, when reporters visited prosecutors Liu and Zhu, they both stated that they could not express any opinions as the investigation was still ongoing. However, they believed that the arrogant attitude of the airline staff had a negative impact on their work and needed to be improved. The investigation of the case will not have new developments until the company's investigation report arrives.</p>
<h3>Personnel of the Ninth Inspection Brigade Announced</h3>
<p>In order to unify the command of the military police and security forces within the Shanghai Garrison District, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters decided to establish eight inspection brigades and one waterborne inspection brigade, totaling 31 detachments.

<h3>Poisonous Potatoes Should Not Be Eaten During Sprouting</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a recent report from Lingdu, Jiangxi, the Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry stated that a local peasant purchased more than a dozen potato seeds from Guangdong. Because there were surplus potatoes, he fried them and gave them to two children (seven and five years old) to eat. Half a day after eating, the two children died. Therefore, he inquired about what kind of toxic substance was contained in the potato seeds. The Department of Horticulture of the Institute explained that when potatoes sprout, a toxin called "Solanin (C42H76N19)" is produced due to physiological and chemical changes. This toxin is mostly accumulated in the buds and under the skin. Once ingested, mild cases will cause throat irritation and diarrhea. If ingested in excess, it can affect the brain, causing paralysis, drowsiness, and convulsions. Pregnant women are prone to miscarriage if they eat it. In severe cases, it can reduce heart and blood circulation, causing excessive carbon dioxide in the blood, circulatory stagnation, and death. Therefore, sprouted potatoes should not be eaten. If you want to eat them, you must thickly peel off the buds and the skin, and soak them in water for several hours before boiling them. Only then can they be eaten. If they are not properly treated, it is also not advisable to feed them to livestock. Potatoes sprout most vigorously when planted in the spring. In other words, this is when the "Solanin" toxin is secreted most vigorously. The farmer did not detoxify the potatoes and fed them to children in large quantities. Children have weaker resistance, so they died half a day after eating, which was obviously poisoning.</p>
<h3>Married Woman in Love; Monk Tempts Her; Knowing It's a Nightmare, Yet Still Lingering</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A student, Dong, from St. John's University recently filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate, accusing his wife, Dong Xianshufen, of adultery with the monk Bao Yun, the abbot of the Nanhui branch of Jing'an Temple. It is reported that Gu Shufen is 24 years old this year, and the monk Bao Yun is also 24 years old. Miss Gu used to teach at the Buddhist primary school attached to the Nanhui branch of Jing'an Temple, and the monk Bao Lian was also the principal of the Buddhist primary school. Working together day and night, it was inevitable that they would develop a relationship. Dong soon learned of the secret, and Miss Gu also knew that she was wrong. She wrote a letter to her husband expressing remorse. However, Dong recently discovered that his wife and the monk Bao Lian were still lingering, and the embers were about to rekindle. Unable to bear it, he sued the District Procuratorate and presented the previously written "Letter of Repentance" as evidence. Although there was no clear explanation in the letter, there were phrases such as "a nightmare..." The District Procuratorate accepted the case and separately summoned the monk Bao Lian and Dong Gu Shufen for questioning. Both denied the charge of adultery. The prosecutor is still continuing the investigation.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Decides Passengers Must Purchase Life Insurance for Passage; Fee Included in Ticket Price</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau's Transportation Permit Port Committee passed a resolution and convened a meeting yesterday afternoon with the Shipping Industry Association and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to organize a review committee for determining the passenger capacity of ships. The first meeting was also held, and the following methods were discussed and resolved: (1) The passenger capacity of ships on long routes will continue to be implemented according to the original regulations of the Ministry of Communications. (2) The passenger capacity of ships on short routes (i.e., those that can run one round trip per day) will be doubled or increased by two-thirds compared to before. However, this method must be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval before it can be implemented. (3) After the passenger capacity of ships on short routes is increased, all life-saving equipment on board should also be increased proportionally. (4) In the future, all passengers must purchase life insurance before boarding. This insurance will be handled by the shipping company on their behalf, and the fee will be included in the ticket price. There were originally two lifeboats at the Wusongkou port, but they have not been restored since then. It was decided to report this to the Port Committee and ask the Customs to restore them to prevent emergencies.</p>

<h3>Social Services; Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Lung Disease Doubts Sun Tiejian asked: I am a lung disease patient, and I have several questions. I would be grateful if you could give me some instructions. (1) I have been having air injections for half a year, with a maximum volume of 750 c.c. The lung lobe has been compressed to 90%, but I am still unable to work. Even a slight movement causes my heart to beat non-stop and my breathing to be rapid. What is the reason for this? Will air injections induce "asthma"? Also, when the weather is colder, I accidentally catch a cold and have asthma, wheezing, and difficulty coughing up phlegm. Is this chronic bronchitis? What medicine should I take? (2) How many multivitamin pills should I take daily to compensate for this wasting disease? Why does the urine turn yellow-green within two hours of taking Squibb's multivitamin pills? Can I stop taking cod liver oil pills if I am already taking multivitamin pills? Are the milk tablets sold on the market better than capsules? (3) I am very prone to catching colds. Will taking "Aspirin" regularly worsen lung disease? (4) Before the air injections, I had four swollen lymph nodes in my neck (changing from hard nodules to abscesses). They have ulcerated one after another. After applying sulfanilamide ointment, two of the broken nodes have closed. Does this prove that my lung disease is gradually improving? Does the use of sulfanilamide have any side effects?</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Tang Renjin, MD] (1) After the lung lobe is compressed, the respiratory surface of the lung is reduced. If you do a lot of movement, asthma will naturally occur. (2) Lung tuberculosis patients need a large amount of vitamins. It is better to take several pills. The discolored urine is probably not due to taking multivitamin pills. You can take cod liver oil pills (AD) even if you are already taking a large amount of vitamin pills. (3) Pay attention to the weather and health care. Aspirin should be taken sparingly. (4) It is mostly a sign of improvement. There is no specific ointment.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Newspaper and Renhe Hospital Jointly Provide Free Obstetrics Assistance to Poor Women</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that poor pregnant women are often unable to afford delivery and medical expenses, which affects the health of the mother and child, and that there are quite a few such pregnant women who come to the newspaper for relief, this newspaper has discussed a cooperation plan with Renhe Hospital on Xiangshan Road to provide relief. Zhang Xiangwen, the director of the hospital, strongly agreed. After several consultations, the application method was determined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Those who reside in this city and are truly poor and unable to afford delivery and medical expenses can obtain an application form from the newspaper by submitting a letter of introduction from a reader of this newspaper. After the form is certified by the chief of their respective Baojia, they can apply for registration to the Social Services Department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>(2) Renhe Hospital will conduct a preliminary physical examination for the pregnant woman based on the application form approved by Shen Bao. All outpatient and examination fees will be waived.</p>
<p>(3) Renhe Hospital will regularly set up free hospital beds. Pregnant women approved by the newspaper will not be charged for normal deliveries. Difficult deliveries will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>(4) The free pregnant women can be hospitalized for a maximum of ten days. In special cases, the period may be extended as appropriate.</p>
<p>(5) Renhe Hospital will settle the accounts once at the end of each month and submit them to the newspaper for publication. The expenses will be raised by the Shen Bao from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>(6) This free obstetrics assistance program will be determined to start from February 1947 for a period of six months. It may be continued with the consent of both parties after the expiration of the period.</p>

<h3>Two War Criminals Receive Prison Sentences: Badatini Gets Life Imprisonment, Shinohara Hisao Gets Five Years. Badatini, Suffering from Heart Disease, Wept Profusely Upon Hearing the Verdict. Four Japanese Military Police Officers Tried Yesterday.</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Italian war criminal Badatini and Japanese war criminal Shinohara Hisao were tried by the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal, and the verdicts were announced yesterday afternoon. Badatini was sentenced to life imprisonment for violating international treaties and supporting the war of aggression against the Republic of China. Shinohara Hisao was sentenced to five years of imprisonment with hard labor for repeatedly committing brutal and oppressive acts against citizens of the Republic of China, causing serious injuries during the war.</p>
<p>Badatini was formerly the Italian naval commander in Shanghai. After Italy surrendered, he was detained by the Japanese in a concentration camp. He was later released after reaching a compromise with the Japanese. The condition of his release was that he would send more than one hundred of his subordinates to work at the Jiangnan Shipyard, which was then a Japanese military arsenal, to produce military supplies for the Japanese army. Shinohara Hisao was formerly a Japanese naval military police sergeant in Shanghai. On the evening of March 26th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he groundlessly arrested Chai Zhenyou, a builder of barges, and brutally beat him with wooden sticks seven times. The presiding judge at yesterday's trial was Li Liang, the judges were Lu Chao and Qu Zehui, the prosecutor was Tu Guangjun, the clerk was Wang Shuliang, the interpreters were Luo Di and Zheng Yiwei, and the defense attorneys were Ai Guofan and Qian Longsheng. After hearing the verdicts, Shinohara Hisao remained indifferent and expressionless, while Badatini's expression changed drastically and he wept profusely. Because he suffered from heart disease, he was released on bail to seek medical treatment at Wangxin Hospital during the trial. After complaining of dizziness yesterday, the court ordered him to be taken into custody. The defense attorney stood up and requested that he be allowed to continue on bail. Judge Li, after consideration, ruled that there were also doctors in the detention center, and if it was deemed necessary for him to receive medical treatment outside in the future, an application could be made, and it would be handled accordingly.</p>
<p>[Another report] The military tribunal also interrogated four former members of the Shanghai Japanese Military Police Corps yesterday: Kenzo Sugawara, Daisan Higashinaka, Teikichi Numano, and sergeant Morehiro Hirata. It is alleged that during their terms of office, these officers wantonly made arrests and inflicted brutal torture. During yesterday's trial, they vehemently denied all the accusations against them.</p>
<h3>For Greedy for Reward Money, Sold Out Comrades; Gambling Losses Led to Betrayal to the Enemy; Five Defendants Vehemently Deny Allegations</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zeng Xisheng, a former group leader of a certain bureau, remained in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation to carry out underground work. Together with his comrades Ren Musheng, Xiong Yuhe, Xiong Runsheng, Lin Zeyuan, Li Xiangsheng, Li Zhetang, Wang Runhe, etc., he infiltrated the Fujigang unit of the enemy military police as an informant. On the sixth day of the fifth month of the 31st year of the Republic (lunar calendar) [1942], Li Xiangsheng, Ren Musheng, Lin Zeyuan, and Li Zhetang, lost money gambling at the Far East Hotel. In a desperate situation, they conceived the idea of selling out Zeng Xisheng to the enemy military police in order to obtain a reward. The Fujigang unit immediately ordered the Japanese officer Shimazaki, along with Ren Musheng, Xiong Runsheng, and the translator Zhao, to arrest Zeng Xisheng, Ren Axing, Li Jinrong, Yang Yuansheng, etc., and brutally tortured them, eventually leading to the tragic deaths of Zeng, Ren, and Li. Furthermore, Wang Runhe served as a deputy detective in the Xinzha Police Station and the Shanghai Police Bureau until the victory [of the war], and was also involved in Li's case. The High Court interrogated the defendants Ren Musheng, Lin Zeyuan, Li Xiangsheng, Li Zhetang, and Wang Runhe yesterday, and all the defendants vehemently denied the allegations. Subsequently, the defendants' lawyers Luo Jiaheng, Xue Jiaqi, Wen Chunxiang, Gu Peilun, and Cai Xiaobai, stood up one by one to defend them. The court announced the conclusion of the debate on this case and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 15th. The five defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Zhoupu Served as Police Deputy; Denies Kidnapping and Murder</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Gong Zongyi, who is accused of being a suspected traitor, was tried yesterday in the High Court. The defendant, nicknamed "Little Gong," served as the captain of the "self-defense" corps in Zhoupu Town, Pudong, and as the deputy of the puppet police squad in 1937. With the enemy Sergeant Inoue as his advisor, he colluded with the deceased puppet regiment commander Xu Hongshe to harm eighteen patriotic compatriots. On October 7, 1938, he led his gang to kidnap Xi Jinfu and illegally detained him for nineteen days. In the winter of 1940, he sent his subordinate, nicknamed "Little Rebel," Shi Gengsheng, to kidnap Zhang Xingnan. On October 27, 1940, he again led people to drag Yang Jinfa to Shen's house in Yangjia Town and shot him in the head. He died from his injuries on February 16 of the following year. In July 1945, he sent Shi Gengsheng and others to shoot and kill Chen Xigen and his wife in a rice field. He also sent Shi Gengsheng and others to strangle Xu Dongyuan to death with a rope. According to the defendant's defense, "I was an intelligence officer in the Loyal National Salvation Army. For the convenience of my work, I held a nominal position as a deputy in the puppet police squad as a cover. I sent Shi Gengsheng to be a guide for the Loyal National Salvation Army, not to kill people." At this point in the interrogation, the court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the trial to a later date.</p>
<h3>White Russian Harmed Our Compatriots; Su Chengde Testifies in Court</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The White Russian, Gao Liang, was accused of serving as a henchman of the enemy military police squad, specializing in killing our compatriots in the Zhonghua Gate and Guanghua Gate areas of Nanjing. Yesterday, the High Court presented Su Chengde, the former chief of the Capital Police Department, who had already been sentenced to death for treason, to testify. The traitor Su was wearing a blue cotton robe and black cotton shoes, his face was ashen, and his brows were deeply furrowed. Regarding Gao Liang's case, he testified that "In 1931, when I was in Nanjing, I heard of a White Russian named Gao Liang, who was cruel and vicious, specializing in killing our compatriots, and serving as an informant for the enemy military police." After completing his statement, the court ordered him to be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Sino-American Hospital Completely Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The labor dispute at the Sino-American Hospital was resolved at 3:00 PM yesterday through the mediation of Director Tao Yishan of the Garrison Headquarters. Employees' severance pay will be issued for three months uniformly, and February salaries will be paid as usual, to be cleared by 6:00 PM on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the report in a certain newspaper the other day that labor-management disputes have successively occurred in the six major public utilities in the city, Director Zhao Banfu of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau stated yesterday that it was inaccurate and a letter of correction has been sent. Currently, only the French Tramway, British Tramway, and the water and gas companies have minor issues regarding year-end promotions, but it is not as serious as rumored.</p>
<h3>Many Disputes Due to Soaring Prices; Social Affairs Bureau Busy Mediating Cases</h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper) The continuous soaring of prices and the issue of labor-management disputes are of great concern. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently mediating and has resolved the following cases: (1) The wages of stevedores at various bank warehouses have recently been increased by 20% universally. However, the Bank of China warehouse refused to comply with the current workers' demand for equal treatment, and submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. (2) The employees of the Yizhong Tobacco Company requested a universal adjustment of their base salaries. The Social Affairs Bureau rejected this request because it conflicted with the regulations. (3) More than forty female workers at the Zhongnan Cotton and Wool Weaving Factory went on strike recently to demand an adjustment of their wages. The Social Affairs Bureau is sending personnel to mediate. (4) The issue of year-end bonuses for workers at the American Sunlight Match Factory has been delayed since December 29th of last year. The labor side is currently demanding one month's salary, while the management is only willing to give half a month's salary, resulting in a stalemate. The Social Affairs Bureau is still trying to mediate.</p>
<p>In addition, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory and Weixin Restaurant have dismissed workers and paid severance pay. The printing industry's demand for an adjustment of base salaries has also been resolved independently, with an additional 45 cents per day for those who do not take leave.</p>
<h3>Half-Brother Denounces Head Cook at Wine Bar; Allegedly Served as Enemy Army Translator; Sun Mingquan Claims Accusation is Malicious</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Sun Mingquan was tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being a traitor. The defendant served as a translator for Kimura, the captain of the enemy garrison in Zhaojialou Town, Nanyan County, during the 29th year of the Republic [1940], and committed numerous illegal acts there. In July of the 31st year [1942], Sun Defu and Qiu Zhengming from Zhaojialou Town were arrested by the enemy garrison. Because no one spoke on their behalf, Sun Mingquan slandered them, and both Sun and Qiu were later executed by the enemy. The defendant claimed: I worked as a Western-style chef at a wine bar in the Daqingfang area of Haining Road. I have never been to Pudong and do not know Kimura at all. The accuser, Sun Wenzhong, is my half-brother. He borrowed 370,000 counterfeit yuan from me in the 34th year [1945], and later I asked him to repay it, so he harbored resentment and falsely accused me. Subsequently, the witness Ma Dexing testified in court: I rented the house to the defendant in the 30th year [1941], and I never saw the defendant go to Pudong. Finally, the lawyer Zhang Naizuo defended him. The court ordered the trial to be adjourned to a later date, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Air Force Pilots Returning from Studies in the United States Arrive in Shanghai on the "General Meigs"</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The "General Meigs" arrived in Shanghai at 3:15 PM yesterday and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. The ship departed from San Francisco on January 24th, with a total of 1,524 passengers. 194 of them were coming to Shanghai, 1,164 to Hong Kong, and 166 to Manila. After arriving in Manila, the ship will not return to Shanghai, but will return directly to the United States. The "General Meigs" was originally a wartime transport ship that was temporarily converted. After returning to the United States, it will be completely refitted into a large passenger ship suitable for peacetime navigation.</p>
<p>Among those arriving in Shanghai on the "General Meigs" were Colonel Jiang Qiyan, an Air Force pilot returning from studies in the United States, and Major Nie Hengbin and Colonel Gong Zhaoqi, who studied aircraft engineering, and ten others. They had been training in the United States for two to four years, in New York and Washington D.C. After resting briefly in Shanghai, they will report to Beijing.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Allocates Public Land for District Offices to Build Housing</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The resolution of the First Session of the Second Municipal Council, regarding the construction of office buildings for the district offices in the city, requested that the municipal government allocate public land for each district to raise funds locally for construction. This proposal has been approved by the municipal government. In addition to ordering the Land Bureau to investigate and allocate municipal public land in each district for self-construction, yesterday it also instructed each district office to contact the Land Bureau directly for processing and reporting.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Strictly Orders Each District to Conduct Random Household Checks at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The municipal government has recently found that the household registration statistics reported by each district regarding registration of origin, identity, and migration are very few. The figures for the floating population are even more lacking. It is evident that the household registration personnel at all levels have neglected their duties, and failed to investigate and register in a timely manner, which will affect the entire household registration work. This is highly inappropriate. Yesterday, the municipal government specially instructed each district office to order their subordinates to conduct household checks strictly and on time according to regulations, to guide the people in handling application procedures, and to report various statistical figures on time, and not to be negligent or delay matters. If any dereliction of duty is found again, they will be punished upon investigation. The district chief, who is also the head of household registration, will also be held jointly responsible.</p>

I admit to the adultery with Xu Meifang without denying it, and claim that the affair began in July of last year. Xu Meifang claimed: That day, I saw Cheng Cuiyun and Gu Yucai walking leisurely near the Yuyingtang on Zhongxing Road in Hongkou. They seemed too intimate, so I went up to Gu to negotiate, which led to a fight. I accidentally pushed Gu into the river on the side of the road. Seeing that I had caused trouble, I fled in a hurry, thinking that Gu had drowned. I firmly deny the allegation in the indictment that I strangled him with a hemp rope and threw the body into the river. He also said that it was purely temporary anger and there was no premeditation, and Cheng Cuiyun did not help commit the murder. After the defendants' lawyers made their arguments, the court stated that the facts of the case were very clear and announced the conclusion of the arguments, scheduling the sentencing for 9:00 AM on the 15th of this month.</p>

The court stated that the case was too long ago and the case files needed to be reorganized, and adjourned the trial to a later date.</p>
<h3>Gust of Wind Blows Off Military Cap; Soldier Jumps Off Truck and Dies</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Approximately 70-80 soldiers from the 20th Rear Wounded Soldiers Hospital were leaving after watching a play at the Gonghe Stage on Zhongzheng Middle Road at approximately 5:45 PM yesterday. They forcibly commandeered a truck heading west to east, license plate number 35092, driven by Zhu Fengchun, 29 years old, from Nantong. The soldiers crowded onto the truck and forced him to drive towards the Bund. When they reached the middle of the Bund near Avenue Edward VII (now Yan'an East Road), the military cap of a soldier named Ge Yutang (30 years old) was suddenly blown to the ground by the wind.

<h3>Central Bank Uses Blitz Tactics, Gold Prices Finally Forced to Turn Back</h3>
<p>From 5.9 Million Foreign Returns to 5.6 Million Level, Still 300,000+ Better Than Previous Close, US Dollar Worries Continue</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, smelted gold once again created unprecedented high prices. It wasn't until a brief moment at noon that the Central Bank, using blitz tactics, began to suppress market prices. The morning opened with demand at 5.32 million, and immediately soared upwards. General psychology held extravagant hopes, and new buyers repeatedly joined in, causing a surge to 5.87 million before supply appeared. Moreover, as rationing approached, it quickly fell back. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank supplied 1,700 bars at a price of 5.72 million, and buyers once again stirred, creating a rising wind. The market rose to 5.93 million, and the Central Bank supplied 3,000 bars with the market, whereupon the returning wind grew stronger, retreating to 5.74 million. However, buyers continued to blindly compete for purchases, once again rising to above 5.9 million near noon. Unexpectedly, in a brief moment after the noon close, the Central Bank seized the opportunity to slash prices and sell cheaply. For a time, there was a lack of buyers, and the fall was severe. Market prices shouted down to around 5.4 million before slightly stabilizing, rising back to above 5.5 million. The afternoon, being Saturday, saw no change. Quoted prices slightly strengthened to the 5.6 million level, resulting in 320,000 better than the previous close. Gold ornaments hung high at 58 yuan. Silver dollars were seen rising again. The underground money market was still stable, with interest rates only around 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also rose initially and then fell. The black market for US dollars opened in the morning at 10,500 and 10,800 yuan, circling and rising, with high prices reaching 11,700 yuan. At noon, it hovered between 10,800 yuan and 11,300 yuan. The afternoon, being Saturday, saw no special changes, resulting in 800 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong currency started with a buying price of 2,000 yuan, rose to 2,300 yuan, and then fell back to around 2,150 yuan, continuing to be 100 yuan more expensive than the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate once rose to 2,300 yuan with transactions, but then there was supply but no demand. The Indian exchange rate was 2,840 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 36,600 yuan, both with supply but no demand.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: In the past week in this city, with the continued surge in gold and currency, various commodity and food markets have followed suit, tracking price increases. Various markets seem to belong to the buyer's world. However, the market's cash position is remarkably loose, and underground interest rates have not been seen to rise high. According to the observation of a certain expert: This phenomenon is probably a speculative market situation. With repeated surges, legal tender is competing in circulation in the market all day long. Since there is no day for returns, market conditions are rising steadily, and the turnover rate can only be seen to accelerate daily. Furthermore, since gold prices in various regions are higher than in Shanghai, floating capital is flowing to this city, so the market's cash position is flooded. It has not become tight due to the sharp rise in various items. Furthermore, in terms of the head positions exchanged by the four banks and two bureaus at the bill exchange over the past week, the surplus on the 3rd was 9 billion yuan, the surplus on the 4th was 9.1 billion yuan, the surplus on the 5th was 7.2 billion yuan, the surplus on the 6th was 2.5 billion yuan, and the surplus on the 7th was 4.2 billion yuan. Yesterday, although the Central Bank still had a surplus, when the four banks and two bureaus were calculated, there was a deficit of 4.1 billion yuan. It can be seen that the amount of surplus in the head positions of the national banks and bureaus in the past week is not significant. Although the Central Bank still stipulates that each bank's weekly exchange of funds to Shanghai is 30 million yuan, it is understood that there are no restrictions on military and political remittances. Judging from past circumstances, the amount remitted to Shanghai is often greater than civilian remittances, which is also a major source of increasing currency in the market.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Instructs Relevant Authorities to Strictly Enforce Rice Price Limits</h3>
<p>17,000+ Bags of Siamese Rice Thrown Out Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, white japonica rice on the black market broke through the 90,000 mark due to the stimulus of gold prices. The Social Bureau threw out a total of 17,720 bags of Siamese rice, the largest amount since the sell-off, with the price still at 63,000 per dan. The Social Bureau dispatched personnel to continue investigating 20 dealers who violated the negotiated price of 76,000 yuan for white japonica rice, with the highest black market price reaching 120,000. They will be punished according to the law. Mayor Wu yesterday instructed the Food Department to notify the police to crack down on all vendors on the roadside and in the Zhoujiaqiao and Xujiahui areas who violate the negotiated price for sale, so as to strictly enforce the price limit.</p>
<h3>Unified Type C Bonds Worried About Rising Again, Up 500 Yuan Alone Yesterday</h3>
<p>Government bonds rose again yesterday with the help of the environment. Unified Type C opened in the morning at 2,500 yuan. General psychology revived fantasies about the government's reorganization and raised it to around 3,250 yuan. After the high price, it triggered large households to sell, and then fell to 2,600 yuan. Finally, it hovered between 2,750 yuan and 2,800 yuan, resulting in a rise of 500 yuan compared to the previous close. Types A, B, and D were all flat, while Type E rose slightly by 50 yuan, with transactions not less than 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Twelve Types of Government Bonds to be Drawn for Redemption Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Artificial Silk, Although Demanding High Prices, Lacks Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's artificial silk continued to rise crazily in the morning. 120's Guanggao Mountain's highest bid reached 6.2 million yuan, which made buyers flinch, and there were no transactions. Afterwards, it circled and fell back, resulting in two boxes of 5.8 million yuan being sold. In the afternoon, because gold prices also fell back, and the allocation of silk had been settled, and the joint venture company could also release materials next Wednesday and Thursday, the market momentum was unsustainable. The asking price was 5.5 million yuan, but there was no one to bid. Generally, 200,000 yuan might have inquiries, which was quite weak. The factory's warp, although high again yesterday, still had few transactions. Only a few dan of opening D grade were done, priced at 6.2 million yuan, which was 200,000+ yuan higher than the previous day. Another ancestor's dry warp was offered at 4.7 million yuan but was still unwilling to sell. The market momentum was quite firm and high. Silk goods continued to rise with raw materials. The morning was very chaotic. As a result, American Asian covers were 100,000 higher, Dacheng's checkered crepe was asking 16,000 yuan, with 5,500 yuan being sold, Huajin crepe was 100 yuan higher, and Shanghai Silk Factory's real silk covers were asking 3.65 million yuan yesterday, but there was a lack of stock, and holders were still unwilling to sell.</p>

At the close, due to too much floating profit, the market sold off, and prices fell to the lowest price of the day, finally rising 700,000 to 800,000 yuan from the previous day. 10-count Double Horse Dafa and various brands of coarse yarn were all 200,000 to 300,000 higher, and people's hearts were quite high.</p>

<h3>Tea Market Only Hears Bidding Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market: Sellers' minds went a step further, and the bidding price was raised more fiercely than before by 30% to 40%. Therefore, negotiations were difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion, and transactions lacked formal openings. According to the news of colleagues, green flower tea, which is specially supplied for domestic sales, recently, the stomach acceptance around Suzhou may also have a comeback situation.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Demand Higher Tea Purchase Prices</h3>
<p>According to news from the tea industry, after the government implemented export subsidies this time, the industry's situation has improved compared to the past. However, domestic costs and foreign selling prices still cannot meet the ideal, so whether the export volume can be expected to increase in the future is still a question. The market prices of various grades of export tea have gradually become firmer recently, but transactions are still very rare. As for the CITC acquisition problem, now that the government's subsidy method has been announced, tea merchants insist on raising the purchase price, and it seems that negotiations have temporarily entered a state of suspension.</p>

<p>The Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee held its second temporary meeting at the Social Bureau yesterday. More than ten people, including Gu Bingyuan, Wu Shufang, and Dong Jiufeng, attended. Director Gu served as chairman, and the following resolutions were made: A. Due to the recent soaring gold prices, the quantity of yarn opened by Textile Construction is small, and prices are gradually increasing, which affects the normal supply of the market, and the black market rises accordingly. However, in order to accelerate the quantity of cotton yarn supplied to the market, it is proposed to submit a request to the municipal government to request the Textile Control Commission to immediately simplify the procedures for the 50% of cotton yarn that is currently being purchased, and supply it to manufacturers in advance to relieve the yarn shortage and stabilize yarn prices. B. The association had previously submitted a request to Mayor Wu regarding the issue of the existence or abolition of the Cotton Cloth Review Committee. Mayor Wu believes that although yarn prices are determined by Textile Construction according to market conditions, the Review Committee is still necessary. Therefore, it was decided to improve the price review method and procedures in five points: (1) Cotton cloth price negotiation will be decided by a subcommittee organized by the Textile Construction Company, the six district cotton textile industry association, the dyeing and weaving industry association, the dyeing cloth industry association, and the social bureau, each sending one representative, who will meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 3 p.m. (2) The standard for the subcommittee's price negotiation should be based on the listed price of Textile Construction's cotton yarn as the main reference material. (3) If the price needs to be increased, it should not exceed the cost and market price. (4) If the market changes drastically, the association will still convene a plenary meeting to decide. (5) The price negotiated by the subcommittee will be announced by the Textile Construction Company and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association. C. The profit of cotton cloth merchants, of which the profit margin for single white fine cloth is reduced to 10%, and the others are still 12%.</p>
<h3>Mexican Gold Has Been Forced to Stop Exporting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] Gold industry insiders say that they believe that Mexico, under pressure from the United States, has given up its gold export business. According to private estimates, the total amount of Mexican gold exports in 1946 was between 90 million and 125 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Hog Bristles and Tung Oil Take the Opportunity to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the announcement of the export subsidy method, the prices of China's main exports have soared. Among them, the price of hog bristles, compared to the market price before the 6th of this month, has risen by 60% to 70%. Most hog bristle merchants believe that it is profitable and hold on to the goods, resulting in a situation of having prices but no market. Tung oil prices have also soared. According to a person in charge of a Chinese vegetable oil factory, before the subsidy method was stipulated, the price of tung oil in China was already very high. Compared with domestic prices and foreign prices, there was a difference of 70% to 80%. After the subsidy method was stipulated, it rose again by 50% to 60%, so the domestic and foreign price difference has exceeded 100%. In other words, even with a 100% subsidy, tung oil exports still have to lose money, and recently the black market for US dollars has risen alarmingly, and China's tung oil exports may still inevitably go to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's claim by the casings industry, the industry is in an extremely unfavorable situation. Xin Feng, the government's implementation of a subsidy system, is expected to recover. After that, the industry hopes to increase the export volume. One is to remedy its past losses, and the other is to offset the country's foreign exchange import surplus, which can have a slight effect. However, the purchase price of fresh intestines is the main issue in the future. After the Spring Festival this year, the initial price of foreign goods and local goods averaged 1,300 yuan per pair. Later, due to the weakness of the foreign market situation, it had successively decreased by 200 yuan. Since the government subsidy news was announced, the purchasing prices of various factories have recovered to the original price of 1,300 yuan, and today it has been increased to 1,600 yuan, which has increased by 30% from the price at the end of last year. Therefore, the association is also very needed in order to attract the source of rural goods to come in an appropriate dimension under the premise of raising the purchase price. However, any arbitrary pricing will result in self-deception. It is heard that the association will soon hold a meeting to discuss colleagues to take consistent steps to limit the highest purchase price.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Football First Battle – Longjie Eliminates Shanyun Yesterday – Intense Battle Ends 5-1</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The second Mayor's Cup football match kicked off at Jin Yuan Park yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Despite the cold wind, there were not many spectators. Longjie met Shanyun in the first match, and the two sides fought fiercely. As a result, Longjie defeated Shanyun 5-1, with the score at 2-0 in the first half. However, Longjie's players acted improperly, which was criticized by the fans. After the game, some unqualified fans took unreasonable actions against Longjie, which was inappropriate and should be corrected.</p>
<p>Longjie</p>
<p>Sheng Peter, Zhou Yongfang, Shen Jinda, Wu Kaimin, Zhao Yongfang, Tao Tingfu, Wang Buyun, Gao Xiuqing, Gu Dirong, Lin Shaojun, Jin Musen</p>

<p>The two sides fought for more than 20 minutes, and Longjie's offensive was fierce, but they mainly broke through in the center, so they did not succeed. At one point, the ball fell in front of Shanyun goalkeeper Li Longming, and Gu Dirong actually stepped on Li Longming's abdomen with his right foot. At 23 minutes, Gao Xiuqing broke through in the center and scored a goal from 15 yards away, making the score 1-0, Longjie took the lead.

Li Minglong did not defend against this move and lost another city. The first half ended 2-0, with Shanyun eating an egg.</p>

Yu Liming kicked the ball and it flew into the right corner of the goal, making the score 1-2, Shanyun pulled back a city. Longjie was uneasy and fought for a long time. At 28 minutes, Zhou Yongfang scored a high ball from 30 yards away, hitting the bottom of the crossbar and being grabbed by Li Longming, but the whistle had already sounded, making the score 3-1, and Longjie's arrogance was even greater. At 39 minutes, Jin Lusheng shot and hit the bottom of the crossbar again. Li Longming was distracted and could not find the ball, and his back brain rebelled, making the score 4-1, and Shanyun was completely defeated. Before the end of the game, Gu Dirong scored another goal, making the final score 5-1.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Last Night – Qinglian Defeats Li Team – Perke Defeats V Team</h3>

As a result, Perke defeated the V team 28-21.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Game</p>
<p>The game between the two sides last night was quite chaotic, with no strategy at all. In the last four minutes of the Perke-V team match, the score was 21-23, and the V team was still one goal behind. Zhu Mingxing and Zhuang Yikai shot many times, but none of them scored. Yu Ersui of Perke took advantage of the situation from both sides. In the last 20 seconds, when Wu Huizhao of Perke took a free throw, Zhu Mingxing shouted for a timeout, but the referee Hu Hongxin did not allow it. In the last six seconds, Yu Erjia of Perke had another free throw opportunity, and Zhu Mingxing shouted for a timeout again. Hu Hongxin thought it was intentional and did not allow it. Suddenly the mirror rang, and the ball happened to be in Zhuang Yikai's hands. Zhuang immediately hit Hu Hongxin with his hand, but did not hit him, and a storm broke out. Hu Hongxin was very angry and said that he would report the incident to the referee committee.</p>
<p>Starting at 5:30 PM today, three men's and women's games will continue at the original location, with the same ticket prices. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Qianghua—Women's Qinghong (Women's Group) 5:30 PM</p>

<p>Railway Jing—Encars (Grade A1) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>In the first game, Qianghua will play against Women's Qinghong. Both Qianghua and Women's Qinghong are making their second appearance, and their strength is relatively weak. It will be difficult for them to defeat the fierce Qianghua.</p>
<p>In the Grade B2 match between Chenyou and Huayang, both sides have won every game. This game is related to the future of the championship, and both sides will give their all.</p>
<p>In the last Grade A1 match, Railway Jing will play against Encars. Railway Jing's style is close to the Northern style, but they have not yet reached the level of mastery. Encars has a strong strength and can be expected to win today.</p>

This isn't to say that the Democratic Party is inherently good and the Republican Party is inherently bad, nor does it prove that the Republican Party lacks talent, or that the Democratic Party has too much talent. These are not the primary reasons. The biggest reason is, on the one hand, due to the domestic and international political environment, coupled with the fact that the policies of Republican President Hoover were too inclined towards isolationism and capitalism, which aroused popular resentment (due to oppression by capital). Just then, the Democratic Party produced a great statesman, Roosevelt. Those who voted for Roosevelt at that time were not only Democrats, but also Republicans, because the intelligent people in the Republican Party also knew that their presidential candidate was not supported by the people. Roosevelt's election was certainly due to his great talent and political genius, but the environment that enabled his success was the main reason. Originally, his third consecutive term was already a stretch, but because the World War was in full swing and the United States was the arsenal of the United Nations, the people all understood the great principle of "an old horse knows the way," so he was elected for the third time. This was rare in the history of the American presidency. Unexpectedly, the fourth election coincided with the critical juncture of the war against Japan, and the people still believed that changing the elected official midway would inevitably affect the war against Japan due to domestic political changes. He was thus elected again in a favorable domestic and international environment.</p>
<p>In fact, in the customs of the American people, this was unprecedented upon unprecedented. The fact that the American people could so patiently elect him repeatedly was not entirely for their own benefit. On the contrary, it was for the sake of the overall global situation. These instances further prove that the American people have vision and are not always entirely selfish. In theory, Republicans could very well have not supported Roosevelt before and during the war, because the rights that Roosevelt's era gave to American labor unions had exceeded their limits. Later, it was even impossible to restrict the unions and workers. As a result, every time workers used unions to demand increased wages and reduced working hours, they were invariably successful, but at the same time, the products and profits of capitalists could not increase. Most of the Republican members represented the propertied class, and they had suffered losses for several years. Fortunately, they compensated for their pre-war losses during Roosevelt's term during the war. Even so, many Republicans still voted for him during the war, because of the overall global situation and because it could compensate for some previous losses. However, because the state's expenditures were enormous, and wartime military spending increased, Roosevelt's military taxes on the people were the biggest source of dissatisfaction for the Republican bourgeoisie, because the heavy taxes meant that capitalists gave nearly 75 percent of their earnings to the government. As a result, the capitalists' hard work and effort were often not as good as that of a foreman (a foreman often has a monthly salary of more than a thousand dollars). In particular, the government's price control policy caused the Republicans a great headache, while what the people got was the black market. These policies were originally good during the war and beneficial to the country. They should have been stopped immediately after the war, but because Democratic President Truman's policy was to conserve Roosevelt's original policies without understanding the great principle of adapting to the times, it further caused the people to have no meat to eat and no sugar to buy, and the black market prevailed. At this time, the people realized that free trade was better. Everyone competed to buy and sell, and as a result, prices fell. Although this was advocated by the Republican capitalists, it was indeed a method that the American people needed, and it has been proven to be effective in trial.</p>
<p>Since President Hoover, the Republicans had been frustrated for nearly twenty years. As mentioned above, the people had long wanted to replace the government with the Republican Party, but due to domestic and international environmental conditions, they were unable to do so. But now the situation is different, and the people's patience has reached its limit. Although the power of labor unions in the United States today is still extremely great (this was promoted by the late President Roosevelt), and socialists, laborers, and communists are gradually expanding, these ultimately cannot suppress the majority of public opinion. This trend has been fully manifested in the increasingly clear trend in the past six months. The initial example was that many people opposed the government's continued implementation of price control policies and heavy tax policies, because the people believed that the war had ended and they should return to the era of free trade and free competition. Although the Democratic Party said that this was instigated by the Republican capitalists, it was also true that the general public was willing to take a breather under price controls.</p>
<p>Congressional Elections Affect Domestic and Foreign Policy</p>
<p>The American congressional elections – not only in the United States, but also the most important American elections for international political figures around the world – the congressional elections, have now been fully revealed. Because the American congressional elections will affect American domestic and foreign policies, they will also affect countries that have close relations with the United States. China's relationship with the United States today is closer than ever before in Sino-American history. The Chinese people's view of the American congressional elections is naturally even more important. For several years, the Democratic Party has held the majority of seats in the upper and lower houses of the American Congress, while the Republican Party has held the minority. This is what the Republican Party wants to fight for. There are 56 Democratic senators, 29 Republican senators, and 1 Progressive senator. (Of these, 32 Democratic senators and 28 Republican senators will not be re-elected, so they are not affected by this election.) Therefore, if the Republican Party wants to win, it must have 21 more elected senators.) This is in terms of senators. There are a total of 435 representatives in the lower house, with the Democratic Party holding 235 seats, the Republican Party holding 192 seats, and the Labor Party holding 1 seat. A total of 47 states across the country participated in the congressional elections. Maine (Mslne) held its elections in September. There are a total of 35 million voters. At the same time, 34 states elected governors. Among these 34 state governors, Democratic governors occupy 16 states and Republican governors occupy 14 states. This is the distribution of Democratic and Republican forces in the American Congress and in each state.</p>
<p>The American congressional elections on November 5, which caused a worldwide sensation, have undoubtedly proven the great victory of the Republican Party over the Progressives. As a result, the Republican Party occupied 239 seats in the 80th Congress, while the Democratic Party occupied 196 seats. Although this is not comparable to the 1936 election, when the Democratic Party occupied 334 seats in the House of Representatives and the Republican Party occupied only 89 seats, nor can it be compared to the 1920 election, when the Republican Party won a great victory and occupied 300 seats in the House of Representatives while the Democratic Party occupied only 132 seats, compared to the Republican Party's situation of not having raised its head in 20 years, it is still considered a great victory for the Republican Party. However, according to my observation, this great victory for the Republican Party was a victory for the Progressive Republicans, or the left-wing Republicans, because the extreme right-wing Republicans are still not supported by the people. The reason is very simple, because these people are too selfish and too inclined to isolationism. These big capitalists all made fortunes by building military supplies for the government during the First World War and taking advantage of the World War. These few extreme right-wing Republicans are not supported by the people. On the contrary, the Progressive Republicans, or the left-wing Republicans, are those whom the people hope can replace the Democratic Party in power. When we study this election, we can find that if we say it was a victory for the Republican Party, it is better to say it was a defeat for the People's Livelihood Party. This election fully proves that the people fear and hate the Communist Party and the Democratic Party's Progressives, or left-wingers – such as former Vice President and Secretary of Commerce Wallace – because in recent years, the Democratic Party, due to Roosevelt's grant of too much power to labor unions, has allowed the Democratic Party's extreme left-wing and the Communist Party to work together hand-in-hand, and the Communist Party has gradually invaded the government and the people. This is something that the people regard as a terrible thing. The people were dissatisfied with the government because of this. During Roosevelt's time during the war, the people could still endure it, because of the overall global situation. Unexpectedly, in the past year or two, the power of labor has not been reduced, and the Democratic Party's extreme left-wing is still cooperating with the Communist Party. President Truman's efforts to stop it have not been effective enough, and the people are still dissatisfied. Wallace's dismissal is just one example. These are all major reasons for the Republican Party's victory.</p>
<p>Consistent National Policy: Adhering to Roosevelt's Platform</p>
<p>Some people, especially those in the Communist Party, analyze the results of this election, saying that it is because President Truman has violated Roosevelt's policies in both domestic and foreign affairs. This is completely untrue, because when he took office, he had already stated that he would continue Roosevelt's policies. These people also criticize him, saying: Because he has repeatedly yielded and surrendered to the pressure of the Republican Party and reactionaries, he has gradually abandoned Roosevelt's platform. They also say that in foreign affairs, he has undermined the peace policy of the Three Powers' unity and the establishment of a collective security system, and has promoted the Byrnes and Vandenberg so-called bipartisan hard-line anti-Soviet Union imperialist atomic bomb and gold dollar diplomacy policy. These are all reversals of the truth. The facts show that if President Truman had surrendered to the Republican Party and abandoned Roosevelt's policies, he would not have been opposed by the Republican Party. He would not have had to force Secretary Wallace to resign. He could have more strongly opposed the Republican Party and not cooperated with the Republican Party. In foreign affairs, I feel that Truman did not accept the opinions of the Democratic Party's left-wing (Progressive) people, such as Wallace, who were close to the Communist Party. On the contrary, he is a conservative right-wing Democratic Party policy. This policy is very cooperative with the Republican Party's left-wing (Progressive) – that is, it does not approve of the Communist Party's invasion of the American people and government. However, the Republican Party's left-wing is more active in opposing the Communist Party, and their views on the Communist Party are somewhat different from those of the Democratic Party's right-wing. In addition to Wallace, the important figures representing the Democratic Party's Progressives include Senator (Claude) Pepper) and the Governor of Georgia (Coveronor Arnall of Georgia). They are all so-called Progressives and liberals of the Democratic Party, but they do not know that they have gone in a direction that is greatly opposed to the will of the people. It is no wonder that even people within the Democratic Party are afraid of them. As a result, due to this phenomenon of division within the Democratic Party, the Republican Party won the election. International communists also said that it was because President Truman surrendered to the big industrial and commercial capitalists and undermined the sound methods of the United States' rapid restoration of a peaceful economy through control to prevent inflation. As a result, people's livelihood was difficult, society was unstable, and economic recovery was hindered. These situations aroused the dissatisfaction of the people, and the Republican Party took advantage of the people's emotions to make all kinds of nice promises to the people, so many voters fell for their tricks, and the Republican Party was able to win, etc. I am well aware of the reasons for the difficulties in the American people's livelihood and the causes of inflation. The reason for inflation is entirely because the government continues to implement wartime price controls. As a result, coupled with the government's heavy tax policies, capitalists cannot make profits from the goods they manufacture due to price controls. The government's heavy tax policies have not been reduced, and laborers are constantly seeking more, striking to demand reduced working hours and increased wages. An ordinary worker can get a monthly salary of 250 to 400 yuan, has a car to drive, and is still not satisfied. In this way, workers, supported by the power of labor unions, are always successful. When workers achieve their goals, purchasing power in society increases, and inflation naturally occurs. The common people can only cry out in pain and complain about the so-called liberals and Progressives of the Democratic Party and the despicable cooperation of the labor unions. This is the reason why people voted for the Republican Party. The direct reason was to strike a blow at the Progressive factions within the Democratic Party, and the indirect reason was to strike a blow at the labor unions and the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The conservative faction, or right-wing faction, of the Democratic Party and the progressive faction of the Republican Party cooperate very well. This is especially true of the Democratic Party leaders and congressmen in the South of the United States. The Communist Party views these people as reactionaries of the Democratic Party. They originally wanted to lead the government on a path that would adapt to the environment and benefit the people. The Communist Party considers these ideas to be incorrect. They believe that these people are destroying Roosevelt's policies and are the dregs of the Democratic Party. This is really an unfair and unreasonable criticism. On the contrary, they believe that Wallace is a progressive leader of the Democratic Party, and that only by supporting Wallace's proposals is one correct. We see that the American people are not confused. Regardless of any party, once it deviates from the right path and goes astray, the masses will immediately distinguish it, and will either not elect it or will overthrow it. Therefore, in the final stages of the election, the so-called Progressive faction of the Democratic Party – to which the Communist Party also echoed – held a large meeting in Chicago, calling themselves liberals, to discuss the progressive platform of the Democratic Party. Wallace attacked the President's foreign policy – a tough policy towards the Soviet Union. However, the American people were even more afraid that these pro-Communist Party people in the Democratic Party would come to power in the future, which would be even worse. Even the conservative people in the Democratic Party could not help but admit that this was not good for the Democratic Party. As expected, the Democratic Party was defeated after the election. Although the labor unions exhausted their strength and spent millions of dollars, they still failed. I feel sorry for the truly good candidates of the Democratic Party, because the Progressives of the Democratic Party were supported by the labor unions and the Communist Party, and as a result, the truly good conservatives of the Democratic Party were implicated and could not be elected. It was truly taking the blame for others.</p>
<p>Even so, because of the close cooperation between the labor unions and the Progressive Communist Party of the Democratic Party, a large amount of money and propaganda was spent. Fortunately, in New York State, the Progressive Lower House members of the American Labor Party, Majimunyi and Powell, were elected to their positions, and the labor representatives Xue Bei'er and Kaplan were elected as upper and lower house members of the State Assembly. These are the only pro-Communist members. It is better to say that the election of these few people was due to the compassion of the Republican Party and the people than that it was due to the will of the people!</p>
<p>Is a Third Party Possible?</p>
<p>Due to the Progressives of the Democratic Party, and some other groups and organizations, although they are called the Democratic Party, in fact, they have long had their own propositions and separate political views. Now there is a phenomenon that these several major forces may merge to form a third party. On September 28 of last year, the National Citizens Political Action Committee, the Industrial Workers Association Political Action Committee, the Arts, Graphics, and Vocational Independent Citizens Committee and other liberal groups held a meeting in Chicago. Their common goal was to seek a common foundation for joint forces. That great meeting included representatives from 31 states. The chairman of the meeting was Morgenthau, from the time of former President Roosevelt, and the agenda committee of the meeting was led by former Interior Minister Ickes. Those who spoke at that great meeting were mainly Senator Pepper and Lower House member La Fayette. Their momentum seemed to be quite large. After the three liberal groups in Chicago closed, liberal groups in New York also convened a joint meeting, organizing a "Liaison Committee." The goal of this committee was to establish a common policy foundation for liberal groups across the country. Many members of this joint meeting were well-known figures, such as former Treasury Secretary Geng Suo, Industrial Workers Association Chairman Mai Rui, the association's Political Action Committee Chairman Ke Luoer, National Citizens Political Action Committee Chairman Jinden, National Lawyers Association Chairman Le, New York United Bank General Manager Li Xixun, and Southern People's Welfare Conference Chairman Fu Erman. They were the most important roles. Others who participated in the meeting, although they were not the initiators of the meeting, but also enthusiastically participated, included Senator Whiteball and former Price Control Bureau Director Ersi. These many powerful people were mostly important officials who left the government during the time of the late President Roosevelt. Through this movement, they also launched a seven-person committee, responsible for reviewing groups that could participate in the meeting. It is said that many labor unions belonging to the American Federation of Labor asked to participate in their movement. These seven-person committee included Ke Luoer, Fu Erman, Independent Union Railway Workers Brotherhood Chairman Chongteler, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Secretary White, Artists, Arts and Sciences Vocational Independent Citizens Committee Chairman Davidson, National Citizens Political Action Committee Vice Chairman Baldwin, and National Farmers Association Chairman Baideng. These people cannot be completely said to be Democrats, but their propositions are the same. For example, they all supported Wallace's views on foreign policy and the atomic bomb. They said: "Because the United States continues to manufacture atomic bombs, our allies will have doubts and distrust. Only after the United States announces the cessation of atomic bomb manufacturing can other countries be willing to gather together to discuss on an equal footing." Their propositions on domestic policy: Rent must continue to be controlled, and a large number of houses must be built quickly to meet urgent needs. Protect the rights of the people, expand social insurance, attach importance to the welfare of workers and veterans, popularize education, science, and art. Improve the livelihood of farmers, develop national resources, support small and medium-sized enterprises, and rationalize taxes. This new political force, which cannot be ignored, is undoubtedly the convergence of the late President Roosevelt's policies. They are neither Communists nor Republicans, nor are they considered Democrats (although they are still Democrats in name). They themselves are a non-widespread political movement, supporting this movement are small and medium-sized capitalists, self-employed people, workers and farmers. These supporters represent the interests of the majority of the American people. The future of this political force is not something that can be ignored. If it develops according to the current development and grows into a third major political party, it is very likely to appear in the near future in the United States. But if they go down the path of communism, they will inevitably be abandoned by the people.</p>
<p>Future American Domestic Policy</p>
<p>Due to the Republican Party's victory in this election, we can be sure of the trend of American domestic policy in the future. Roughly speaking, due to the fact that the Republican Party can manipulate both the upper and lower houses, the first most significant reform will probably be to reduce the heavy tax policies set by Roosevelt during the war. The second will probably be to reduce the power of labor unions. The third will probably be to abolish all price controls. The fourth will be to actively promote free trade competition. Because the Republican Party also won the majority of governorships in this election, especially the re-election of New York Governor Dewey, this lays the foundation for the Republican Party to have the opportunity to nominate Dewey as a presidential candidate again in 1948. From the Republican Party's current point of view, the 1948 presidential election will be as sure as taking something out of a bag. They are very confident. However, it depends on whether the political environment changes at that time. In short, this election is, on the one hand, for the Republican Party to vent its fifteen years of pent-up anger, and at the same time, to prepare for the major presidential re-election in 1948. The significance of this election is mostly entirely in domestic affairs. The significance in foreign affairs is not very great. I will discuss it in detail:</p>
<p>Future American Foreign Policy</p>
<p>The Republican Party's victory this time is definitely not the resurgence of isolationism. This is a major change for the Republican Party in the past twenty years. It would be a great mistake if anyone considered this point. It would be even more absurd to consider that the Republican Party's governance would be unfavorable to China. They simply do not understand the Republican Party clearly. Not only now, but looking far ahead, even if the Republican Party is elected president in 1948, if the conservative faction (or right-wing faction) within the Republican Party wants to run rampant, it will definitely not be welcomed by the people. On the contrary, now and in the future, only the progressive faction of the Republican Party can gain the support of the people. As for the conservative faction of the Republican Party – the isolationists – they have been abandoned by the people for several years and are unlikely to rise again.</p>
<p>One point that the Republican Party will make in the future that deserves special attention from the world is its attitude towards the Communist Soviet Union. In my opinion, only this Beier Nasi policy will be strengthened, and it will definitely not be softened. As for huge loans to the Soviet Union, it will be even more difficult to achieve. Even for large-scale loans to any other country, they will definitely proceed cautiously. However, countries that are friendly to the United States may be an exception. For example, if Britain has a great need, the Republican Congress or President of the United States will also approve the loan. China is the destined friend and neighbor of the United States in the Pacific. The United States has a moral obligation to help. However, it depends on whether we know how to cooperate with this benevolent and powerful friend in the Pacific to build a modern new China in peace. In short, the United States' policy of aid to China will not only not change, but may even be more beneficial. Although it will not be tough on the Soviet Union to any extent, it will definitely not allow the Communist Party to expand further, because both the conservative and progressive factions of the Republican Party hate communism. Finally, I would like to quote the remarks made by New York Governor Dewey after his successful re-election. He said that he would use his greatest efforts to eliminate the terrorism of the Communist Party in New York City and New York State within his administrative jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>The Furious Songhua River: An Eyewitness Account of Battle Scars on Both North and South Banks</h3>
<p>— Our Shenyang Correspondent Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>Airmail from Songbei, January 30th</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 20 Changchun reporters went as a group to the Songhua River to inspect the traces of battlefields on the south bank of the Songhua River after the Communist army's incursion into Songbei. The press vehicle departed in the severe cold of minus 32 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Arrival at Dehui, Meeting with Division Commander Zhang</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Dehui, we met Commander Pan Yu-kun, a veteran of the India-Burma campaign. In conversation, Commander Pan recounted the Communist army's brutality, casting a dark shadow of unease upon the reporters' minds. It was said that during the two weeks the Communist army occupied the Jilin territory, their most prominent atrocities were twofold: first, driving people to their deaths. It was said that in the battle of Jiaojialing, both sides suffered heavy losses. The Communist army besieged a regiment of the National Army, engaging in fierce battles for six days and nights. During the three most intense days, the Communist army attacked in waves of thirty or fifty men, resulting in mountains of corpses. Most of the dead were farmers. No one would believe that these simple farmers willingly fought to the death for the Communist army; it must have been forced upon them. The bodies of Communist soldiers killed in this battle were transported away in carts for seven days and nights, leaving all who heard it grief-stricken.</p>
<p>Pouring Kerosene, Burning Railroad Ties</p>
<p>Secondly, the Communist army's horrific destruction of transportation. The railway line between Dehui and the Songhua River was systematically destroyed, each railroad tie doused with kerosene and burned, and telegraph poles were toppled. Such destructive behavior is infuriating!</p>
<p>North of Dehui, we switched to jeeps to reach the banks of the Songhua River. The biting cold wind stung our faces, and as far as the eye could see, the snow-covered fields were as silent as death. Along the way, all the villages we saw were nothing but ruins, with no sound of chickens or dogs, and little sign of smoke. Occasionally, we saw two or three children standing by the roadside, leaning against walls and watching. They wore thin clothes, their heads shaved, and two trails of snot ran down their faces. When the reporters waved to them, they responded with timid and suspicious smiles.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Cui Discusses Reconstruction Matters</p>
<p>County Magistrate Cui Yunlan of Dehui accompanied us to Songhua River Village. Mr. Lin Guishan, the elderly chairman of the County Provisional Assembly, also came along, his mission being to handle refugee relief. While my colleagues were busy with military affairs, the county magistrate was a bit overlooked, so I took the opportunity to talk with County Magistrate Cui for a long time. He said that in the half-year since taking office, he has found local reconstruction to be extremely difficult, with destruction happening faster than construction. Dehui has a population of 303,860 people, with 30,000 refugees who are without clothes, food, or homes. During their mobile guerrilla warfare, the Communist army robbed all the oxen and seeds, making spring plowing next year hopeless. Famine and death in the spring are already a painful picture unfolding before our eyes.</p>
<p>The Common People Have Only Their Pants Left</p>
<p>County Magistrate Cui said: "The county's finances are extremely difficult. The source of revenue is land tax, but this year's land tax is collected at only 80% of the original rate, which has become a major problem. There is even less hope for next year. Despite being mired in poverty and distress, we still have to find a way to maintain a large security budget." From my observation, the common people really only have their pants left. Refugee relief has become a major issue. Taking Songhua River Village as an example, all fifteen households, over six hundred villagers, have become refugees. The relief grain received from the county government is only two dan (a unit of weight) of grain. County Magistrate Cui concluded: "My ambition lies in education. I will definitely be able to achieve one school per bao (a unit of area) this summer. Currently, the county has one middle school and over a hundred elementary schools, with over 17,000 students enrolled."</p>
<p>Farmers Had to Plead for Their Chickens</p>
<p>The desolate land after the disaster is facing a barren spring. I recalled the beautiful verses of the German poet Goethe and the profound theory they contained: "Gray, dear friend, is all theory, and green is life's golden tree." No amount of touching propaganda can erase the facts. People will experience the truth in experience. In the gray northeastern wilderness, the common people know who is right and who is wrong. What we worry about is the remoteness of green hope. Has spring already come? Why can't we see the land's new green?</p>
<p>The Communist army's political strategy is slightly more sophisticated than before. In this disturbance, they did not forget to win over the people, trying their best to please the poor. Rich farmers and merchants were all thoroughly purged, while the poor received some small favors. I entered a farmhouse where an old farmer raised more than twenty chickens. On the window of the chicken coop was pasted a red paper strip that read "Golden Chickens Fill the Rack," signifying the New Year. I was surprised that his chickens had not been stolen. The old man said, "I'm old, and I rely on these chickens for my livelihood. I kowtowed and begged to get the chickens back."</p>
<p>The Stronghold Stands Firm</p>
<p>The military guided reporters to visit the stronghold on the north bank of the Songhua River. The story of the stronghold in this battle is very moving. Two platoons of the National Army held their ground for eleven days without being breached. The bullet-scarred stronghold stands on the north bank of the Songhua River, the best witness to yesterday's battle. The railway bridge it guarded has been destroyed again. According to railway personnel, it will take a year to repair it, which shows the severity of the destruction. Judging from the terrain on both banks of the Songhua River Bridge, the east bank is lower than the west bank. The firepower of the National Army on the high ground of the west bank suppresses the Communist army from a commanding position. The east bank is a sloping ground with no large blind spots for concealment, so the Communist army had to sneak into the grass at night to dig foxholes.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Cui pointed to the dilapidated wall standing quietly and said: "Songhua River Village is a very good place for scenery. Many people come here in the summer to escape the heat." What I saw was not a single complete house. White Russians lived here, and it is said that one White Russian knelt down and begged the Communist army not to burn his house. Currently, seventy-odd White Russian refugees have flocked to Changchun.</p>
<p>Although Songhua River Village is dilapidated and lonely, as we bid farewell to it, we felt a deep sense of reluctance, constantly remembering the suffering compatriots here, tears hanging sadly from the corners of their eyes.</p>
<h3>Xi'an: Winter Departs, Spring Arrives</h3>
<p>— Our Xi'an Correspondent Li Chi</p>
<p>The way the common people of North China divide the winter season according to weather is quite scientific: starting from the winter solstice, every nine days is taken as a segment. The first nine days are called "First Nine," the tenth to eighteenth days are called "Second Nine," and so on until the first day of the "Sixth Nine," which coincides with the "Beginning of Spring," and the last day of the "Ninth Nine" marks the end of winter. As for coldness, the "Third Nine" is considered the "absolute peak," hence the saying "Third Nine, Third, ice cracks the brick." This winter, the heavens have been particularly kind to the poor. Today is the first day of the "Fourth Nine," and the coldest days have not yet arrived. Heaven is good, clearly knowing that officials like to procrastinate. It's just a winter relief fund of 60 million yuan, which has been delayed until the "Fourth Nine" to be distributed. Fortunately, the "Third Nine" didn't "crack the brick," otherwise, how many new cold ghosts would be added to the underworld!</p>
<p>Investigation, registration, review, filling out forms and registers, taking fingerprints and affixing official seals. How much can each refugee receive? 4,000 yuan for a large household, 2,000 yuan for a small household, one-time payment. The original plan to issue it twice has also been halved. 4,000 yuan is just enough to buy one-tenth of a bag of flour, and 2,000 yuan can't even buy two steamed buns. The plan says to prepare to relieve 20,000 people, but the number investigated is far less than that. If there are really fewer poor people, that would be the best. But if there are poor people who can't get on the list, then they can only eat the northwest wind. Anyway, the poor ghosts die, it's their fate! Relief, relief, just a touch, following the rules!</p>
<p>The word "beggar" is not pleasing to the eye, okay, let's call it "Vagrant Reformatory." The daily food expenses for those housed in the "reformatory" are exactly 500 yuan, which has only recently been increased to 800. Is it enough to eat half full? That's only known to the heavens. It's a pity that most of the "vagrants" who should be "reformed" are "cheap bones." They can't be "reformed" in the "reformatory" and "flee," which is so "detrimental to the city's appearance." However, in all fairness, the shame of the city is not limited to the big and small beggars suffering from hunger and cold.</p>
<p>It's the same banknote, but a rich man gives it to a hungry ghost as "alms," and a poor man gives it to the boss as a "contribution." The people of Xi'an have also learned "humor" in their straightforward lives. Seeing that a bag of flour is still 40 catties, after the "Price Evaluation Committee" adjusted it twice within ten days in the middle of last month, the price per bag was "limited" from 25,000 to 35,000, and the black market frantically broke through 40,000. No wonder people say: this is not a "limited price," but a "tacit price," because the new price announced is even higher than the market price. What is this if not a "contribution"?</p>
<p>At that time, there was an episode: lawyer Zhang Hengxin filed a lawsuit with the local court before New Year's Eve, demanding food for the citizens. The court immediately dispatched bailiffs to the flour mill to seal up the account books for future verification. The flour mill responded hard enough, they stopped grinding flour, and at the same time, the Flour Industry Trade Union came forward, saying that lawyer Zhang was "destroying the lives of workers," "destroying industry," and should be "punished according to the law"! They also said that the accounts were sealed and they could not start work, but this distorted reason could not withstand the court's solemn statement. Now they have already resumed work, and the account books are still sealed.</p>
<p>In this episode, we saw the "magical" "flour offensive" again. Those who usually claim to be the "voice of the people" were silenced by the flour this time. The flour, as white as foreign money, has also whitened the tips of many people's noses. Those who should speak do not speak, but those who speak say what they should not say. Sealing the account books was a small matter, but some people deliberately linked it to the Communist Party's "liquidation," calling it "great treason"! (Then, who is "greatly loyal and filial"?)</p>
<p>Zhang Hengqi is also a city councilor of this city. In the fourth plenary session of the city council this month, some people predicted that this matter would at least give the listeners and citizens who eat expensive noodles a "happy" feeling, but in fact it did not. In the council, it was only mentioned as a matter of course, then "recorded in the minutes," "put on hold," without result. The chief prosecutor of the local procuratorate also did not clearly indicate that there was any way to handle the matter, how to handle it according to law.</p>
<p>No wonder that when things first happened, some people predicted that this would be nothing more than a "storm in a teacup," a "storm in a flour bag." Try listing the names, and see if there are any "news figures," officials and merchants, on the list of shareholders, directors, supervisors, etc. of those flour mills!</p>
<p>According to the report of the resident committee of the provincial council. The flour price in this city has repeatedly risen, which has greatly affected the people's livelihood. The committee has repeatedly passed resolutions to be sent to various newspapers for publication, but some newspapers have not published them, which is a pity!</p>
<p>The city council's accusation against Luo Chufan, the chief of the military affairs section of the city government, and Zhang Ji'an, the chief of the second district, for colluding and embezzling, was the most moving event in the council. At the meeting, the councilor questioned the section chief until he was exhausted and unable to defend himself, and resolved to immediately detain Zhang Ji'an, but the mayor said that he could only suspend him from his duties for investigation, with double surety, and be available for questioning at any time. The accusations against them include deducting the resettlement fees and conscription fees for recruits, levying additional recruits, withholding wages and tea money for airport construction workers, etc. The truth of the matter is still under investigation. It is said that the city government has held a secret meeting to review this matter. The division headquarters of the military control area is also paying close attention to the development of this matter, which may involve an unexpectedly wider range of people. In addition, some people also revealed that the problem does not lie in Zhang Ji'an alone.</p>
<p>This major event related to administration, I think, cannot also be "unfinished" and "unresolved."</p>
<p>A certain councilor questioned at the meeting: "In the recruit conscription center, recruits gamble day and night, and the host turns a blind eye; there are many sick recruits, and some have died...". Such actions are enough to make people "shudder"!</p>
<p>Public servants who "abide by the law and perform their duties" seem destined to endure cold and hunger. The new salary adjustment announced last month, although some are directly under the central government, have not been implemented to this day; the provincial-level ones can only be paid retroactively now. Not to mention the city-level ones, the monthly salary received by a city government clerk, after deducting the price of flour, is only a few thousand yuan, not even enough to make up a recently issued 500-yuan gold yuan new note!</p>
<p>Professors from Northwest University and Northwest Institute of Technology have repeatedly called for improved treatment, and resolved to go on strike on the 16th if a satisfactory solution is not obtained. On the 14th, they received a reply from the Ministry of Education, saying that "they are fighting hard to get the Executive Yuan's approval." The professors, in order to take care of the students' studies, temporarily maintained continued teaching. How much milk can a hungry cow squeeze out, and how much longer can it be squeezed?</p>
<p>In fact, there are figures that can be used as evidence. Even if salaries are paid according to the new salary standards in December, public servants' lives are still very difficult. Because the prices here have already far exceeded those in Beijing and Shanghai, but the treatment in the Xi'an area is classified as third-class instead. At the beginning of this month, seventeen units of the central government-affiliated agencies stationed in Shaanxi jointly telegraphed to request a change, and to be classified as first-class according to the Beijing and Shanghai examples, but there has been no response to this day.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we are not surprised to see the following figures in the statistics of cases accepted by the Jin-Shaan Inspectorate in the 35th year of the Republic: among the more than 1,790 cases, the most were those belonging to the accusation of corruption and bribery. This is an "explanation" and an inevitable "conclusion". (January 30)</p>

<h3>"A Faraway Love" is a Milestone</h3>
<p>— Ye Yiqun</p>
<p>I have often held the private opinion that the standard of domestic films has consistently lagged behind that of spoken drama, not only in terms of content but also in terms of form. However, after recently watching the preview of "A Faraway Love," this prejudice of mine was shattered. I feel that "A Faraway Love" inherits the excellent traditions of the New Drama of the past twenty years and develops them; at the same time, it gives full play to the unique strengths of film. Therefore, it is able to represent the development of reality over such a long period of time (fourteen or fifteen years) and such a vast space (Shanghai, Wuhan, Guilin). That kind of economical, concise, and vivid technique is beyond the reach of spoken drama; and its depth of understanding and representation of reality far exceeds that of past domestic films. Therefore, if we say that it is a striking milestone of the new film, it is probably not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>It takes the process of the combination and separation of Xiao Yuanxu and Yu Zhen as the warp, and the ups and downs of the waves of the times (September 18 Incident, August 13 Incident, Abandonment of Wuhan, Retreat from Guilin) as the weft. In this intersecting warp and weft, it shows the progress of working women and the regression of intellectual who are good at fantasy, and it also illustrates the trends of the masses in various eras quite clearly. This harvest is indeed valuable.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will feel that it criticizes intellectuals too harshly, which is somewhat unfair. However, we must not forget that it only criticizes one type of intellectual, and not all intellectuals. Isn't Li Lianqun a side view of an upwardly mobile intellectual?</p>
<p>The appropriateness of the location and the beauty of the photography also created a new record for domestic films. In short, this is indeed a new harvest of film art developed after "Song of the Fishermen," "The Tao Li Tribulation," "Crossroads," etc.; and it has also found the right path for Chinese film art.</p>
<h3>Review of "A Faraway Love"</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>"People cannot but be affected by the environment, and those who cannot adapt to the environment must be transformed." "A Faraway Love" develops based on this point.</p>
<p>University professor Xiao Yuanxi (played by Zhao Dan) is a psychologist. His personality is very exaggerated, and he is also very confident. His view of life is to use his thoughts to transform others. Therefore, he wants to transform a rural woman (played by Qin Yi) in his family into a modern woman. The result of this plan is successful. The ignorant rural girl becomes a modern young lady and becomes Professor Xiao's wife. However, after being educated, she discovers that Professor Xiao is just a theorist who cannot adapt to the trend of the times. He is full of opposition to feudalism, but he hopes that she will become a family woman under feudal thought. Of course, a truly modern woman is unwilling to be bound by these constraints. She knows how to cater to a great era, struggles to break free from the shackles of the environment, and devotes herself to the embrace of suffering China, dedicating her love to countless suffering compatriots. Finally, Professor Xiao is moved, and he understands the true meaning of love.</p>
<p>After watching "A Faraway Love," I admire the playwright's creation of the characters' personalities. Professor Xiao on the screen flaunts himself, shows off his skills, insists on his prejudices, and is good at criticizing others for not being able to adapt to the environment, but he is not good at blaming himself. In fact, his own thoughts also need to be transformed. Finally, on the way to escape in Guilin, he suffered all kinds of hardships: wading barefoot in water, receiving relief food, and warming himself with straw. Without the磨折 of hardship, how could he suddenly wake up? Thus, he felt the greatness of mutual assistance, and he understood the true meaning of faraway love. The playwright's indication is precisely this point.</p>
<p>The transformation of the two personalities of Professor Xiao and his wife is very difficult to perform well on the screen, but the director's technique is superb, helping the actors to overcome this difficulty. For example, the transformation of the rural girl Yu Zhen can be seen in her hair: in the era of the maid, she wore a big braid; when the professor transformed her, it had already been changed to two small braids, showing that she had gradually paid attention to decoration; after the transformation was completed, she completely became a urban woman. The hair has been permed, fully expressing her love of beauty; finally, she participated in women's work. The hair has returned to an extremely simple form. In addition to these that have obtained the greatest dramatic effect, there are many beautiful and moving pictures and interesting and lively shots on the screen: such as Professor Xiao's encounter on the way, the air of wanting to say but stopping, is a turning point in his life journey; a meal in a large hotel and swallowing a cake while fleeing is also a strong contrast; the ranks of Japanese soldiers on the road are an echo of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the future; and Yu Zhen's barefoot wearing grass shoes and Professor Xiao's taking off his leather shoes and going barefoot are also very meaningful comparisons. However, small flaws are inevitable. For example, in the opening scene of Professor Xiao's public speech, a few shots of a female listener applying rouge and powder and applauding seem unreasonable; the insertion of Manli's part seems superfluous; and the few scenes of the professor teaching class seem unrealistic.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Zhao Dan's Xiao Professor and Qin Yi's Yu Zhen, depicting two different personalities, have achieved the greatest success: Professor Xiao's talk is slippery and irrelevant, and the clumsy movements when he is down and out depict a living picture; Yu Zhen's mourning for the death of her father, brother, and child, and the subsequent undertaking of relief work, showing great love, can absorb the emotions of the audience.</p>
<p>The recording is probably not as ideal due to the limitations of the material environment, but I hope it can be continuously improved.</p>
<p>I recommend this film.</p>
<h3>Charles Vidor Talks About Rita Hayworth</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>Columbia Pictures' famous director Charles Vidor, "A Song to Remember" is his most successful work. Here is a conversation he had with reporters about Rita Hayworth:</p>
<p>I admire Rita as the most beautiful, sweetest, and most talented female star. In the past, we have collaborated three times, the first time was in "The Lady in Question" in 1940, and then there were "Cover Girl" and "Gilda." If the company authorities allow it, I hope to cooperate with her thirty more times. Because she is really like a tame baby, she is never late for acting, works extremely seriously, and will not ask you to allow her to go out for dinner at eleven o'clock or leave the set at four o'clock! However, when she is unhappy, she will also be very angry and stamp her feet; however, I can say that such a situation often happens outside of working hours, the reason is: "The life of a movie star is very hard after all. Imagine a girl who has to get up at six in the morning, makeup at seven, and work all day from nine o'clock until dark, lacking spiritual comfort and material enjoyment, can she endure it?" So Rita is sometimes very painful and easily hurt emotionally, so her marriage is also often unpredictable. When "The Lady in Question" started filming, she and Eddie Judson announced their divorce. When "Cover Girl" started filming, she had just married Orson Welles.</p>
<p>However, during the filming of "Gilda," one morning she did not come to work at the company. I thought something unexpected must have happened, because she never absents herself for no reason. Sure enough, that night, the news of her divorce from Orson spread throughout the entire film city, but the next day she still came to work at the company as usual. Her face did not appear pale, and there were no tears in her eyes. Everything was kept the same as usual. The staff on the set said in surprise: "What's going on?" She didn't tell me about this matter, and I didn't know at all. This is a mystery, always a mystery. However, I can declare on her behalf that she certainly did not have a "close friend" at the time.</p>
<p>Now fans are concerned about whether she will marry someone else again? She said "no" herself. According to my speculation, she still needs the comfort of the opposite sex, because she feels lonely. However, you have to ask: "Can she find a suitable person again?" Of course, I cannot answer this question with certainty, but I hope she can anyway. Rita can indeed be a virtuous wife and a kind mother, only if the husband understands her temperament.</p>
<h3>History Forest</h3>
<p>— Jiang Niao</p>
<p>History Forest has already met the audience several times on the Shanghai stage, but the audience may not necessarily notice her because the roles she plays on stage are not young girls, but old ladies in their forties and fifties. However, her acting skills are quite superb. Recently, in "Women and Peace," she played the president of the women's association, and from her appearance, one can see the extent of her understanding of the characters in the play.</p>
<p>In "Women and Peace," it seems to span from feudal to modern times (which can be seen in both costume and acting). In the first half of the play, History Forest's costume is a long robe and a long scarf, while in the second half, it is modern women's attire. In the introduction of these two appearances, coupled with her own acting skills, her own cultivation, and understanding, she introduces this character very clearly. Just looking at her gathering her sleeves and her expression while sitting on the bridge reading is enough. Although this character is undefined, she can still introduce it clearly, which is not easy.</p>
<p>She is a graduate of the Beiping Art Academy, has a considerable artistic background, and therefore has a deep understanding of spoken drama. After leaving Beiping, she went to Chongqing to join the spoken drama camp. She enjoyed a high reputation on the Chongqing stage and was welcomed by the general audience as an actress. However, she is not satisfied with this, nor does she feel complacent because of it. In her own words, she is still learning, and the accusations and criticisms of friends and audiences are her best guides. She humbly accepts everyone's opinions, and from these humble attitudes, we can know that she is a remarkable actress.</p>
<p>She is a woman with masculine beauty, with a bold and unrestrained temperament and a healthy physique. When you see her on the road, she is definitely not a gentle, virtuous wife and mother type of girl, but a straightforward girl who means what she says.</p>
<h3>Sympathy and Hatred Watching "Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon"</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>"Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon" depicts a group of young men and women who love art, using drama as a weapon against the enemy, and exerting their combat power in the front and rear. This drama troupe suffered from wind, frost, rain, and snow during the eight-year war of resistance, and tasted all the hardships of life. The reward they got was a series of misfortunes, only with infinite comfort to their own conscience.</p>
<p>The male and female protagonists in the play, Gao Libin and Jiang Lingyu, joined the drama troupe since the beginning of the War of Resistance and did not leave the team until after the victory to return home. However, their home was gone, and they could only temporarily live in relatives' houses. Because they could not stand the decadent life of this family, they moved to a small attic-like house to live in, and their life was extremely poor. Jiang Lingyu, who was pregnant, worked late into the night. Because of the usual lack of nutrition, she could not support the heavy work and fainted by the roadside. If it were not for this group of friends in the drama troupe, she would have been carried out of the hospital.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to them, is Jiang Lingyu's cousin, a speculative, opportunistic scoundrel who only wants to become an official and make a fortune. While others were suffering for the War of Resistance, he hoarded and speculated to make a fortune from the national crisis, living a life of extravagance and drunken dreams. After the victory, he was even able to return to his hometown by plane and become a receiving officer, taking advantage of his power to seize the houses of widows and then resell them to others, earning gold bars from them. This kind of despicable and shameless person lives in tall foreign-style buildings and lives a life of being waited on by hundreds of people. And it is so peaceful and uneventful, how can people not be angry!</p>
<p>Today's society is so dark. Those who work hard all day long and do not speculate live a bitter life of hunger and cold; those who do things that harm others and benefit themselves and do not care about shame can ride in cars and live in foreign houses. It seems that this society is encouraging people to do more of this kind of illegal things. Otherwise, why can such bad guys survive in this society?</p>
<p>"Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon" gives us the facts of these two sides. The directors did not add a causal ending of "good is rewarded with good, and evil is rewarded with evil" to these characters. I wonder if the audience will think about how to pay out sympathy and hatred. I think: corrupt officials and奸商s will praise Jiang Lingyu's cousin and laugh at the other pair of fools!</p>
<h3>Random Talk About New Films</h3>
<p>— Ma Bolang</p>
<p>Since You Left</p>
<p>Alas, the bones on the Pacific shore are still people who dream of deep struggles. The winter rain and snow fall gently, the owner of the house no longer returns, a sobbing woman's world. "Soldier's Soul" reveals the true lives of soldiers, but here are sparse, cold and 清清战士的 families, the rear without artillery fire, the reality in the eyes of Americans. The women here do not have a river to separate them, they are terrified by the aspirations of all mankind, love and life. Who has forgotten that peaceful world? The boundless wilderness, a pair of small figures running forward, songs chasing the floating clouds, the future seems limitless, rain shelter in the granary, tender affection, only in an instant everything is empty. Since you left, the hall is also so 条.</p>
<p>The director is Hank Powell, with a long history. "Little Rascal Biography", "Three Musketeers", "Secrets of the Louvre", "Wanderer at the Cape" are his masterpieces. He regards "Since You Left" as his representative work over the years. He recommended this film as one of the top ten blockbusters of 1944. His directing skills are very detailed, the empty seats at the beginning, the pipe, men's utensils, the things that Kean and her boyfriend eat in the restaurant, the man coming back to pick up things three times, the narrative is detailed, without omission. But in general, John Cromwell's technique is not as concise as Mervyn LeRoy's. "Since You Left" is an excellent film, but it is too long, and some places are a bit boring. When it is too detailed, it feels superfluous and can be omitted. The inability to be compact becomes a shortcoming. For example, the black slave covering Kean with a quilt to comfort her, the old colonel and the little girl cultivating flowers and plants, the mother and daughter taking the train to inquire about news, etc., are all extraneous and unnecessary. The crying scene is repeated, but it does not feel sad. In fact, it is enough to paint parasol trees and drizzle to be sad. Therefore, in terms of skill, "Since You Left" is inferior to "The Human Comedy" of the same meaning. The soundtrack of this film is worth mentioning, the "Ave Maria" during prayer, the "Home, Sweet Home" when returning home, and the southern folk songs sung in front of the wounded soldiers' beds are arranged very realistically.</p>
<p>The actors can be said to be made in heaven, and the lineup is lovely. Selznick's scheduling has always been appropriate, and everyone is suitable for their personality, and it seems that they have not made any effort in acting. Claudette Colbert's achievements over the years have proved that she is not just a comedian. The change in expression when listening to the phone at the end and in the dance is her forte, and I have a deep trust in her. Jennifer Jones won the Academy Award in 1943, playing a girl who is pregnant with spring, quite pure. She said that Claudette's eyes are the most beautiful among Hollywood actresses, which I cannot understand. Joseph Cotten is steady. Shirley Temple is about the same as "I'll Be Seeing You". Robert Walker is always interesting, more outstanding here than the assistant in "Madame Curie".</p>
<p>Flock of Chicks Playing with Phoenix</p>
<p>In love strategies, pretending to be stupid seems to be the key. Pretending to be a child to make the opponent's heart flutter is always guaranteed. It is also pretending to play with men, because there is an exaggeration of "between men and women" first, we praise Diana Barrymore's joy, anger and anger, and the farce directed by Henry Koster makes the audience laugh, and "Flock of Chicks Playing with Phoenix" feels plain. The director Billy Wilder is also considered famous. The ugliness of a group of children pursuing big things is all over the place. It is a pity that the person who pulls hair in the ball is not added to 利川 to create laughter, but just a row of original backgrounds.</p>
<p>Loretta Young's acting skills are not weak, peaceful and beautiful. This really plays three periods, all equally appropriate, really suitable for all ages. But she didn't wear any flattering new clothes, not like Diana Barrymore who showed herself all the time. Ray Milland did not have the opportunity to play like Robert Cummings, did not fall for Loretta Young's Susie, nor did he suffer a lot, and even could not pretend to be embarrassed. Only Diana Lynn, who played the younger sister of the fiancée, was only sixteen years old at the time, but she established her base for acting from then on.</p>
<p>Madame Curie</p>
<p>There are more stars in the sky, yes, Madame Curie's old teacher said it right, those stars of truth shine in the dark night. Madame Curie found that starlight, it was the wrong lock, the brilliance of love. In the drizzling rain, going away with an umbrella, under an umbrella is their eternal world. Mervyn LeRoy arranged the gentleness, he used his sophisticated lyrical technique, meticulously, wrote out the value of love, how great it can create. Madame Curie is not a strange person, but a woman who deeply understands the power of love. The marriage proposal and honeymoon trip have a relaxed melody of life, and all courage and perseverance can be restored in the embrace of love, not to mention the failure of more than forty times. Curie's death was also for his wife's piece of jewelry, a symbol of love. The scene when the bad news came, the silence after the knock on the door, was the stillness before the storm, the invisible climax, Madame Curie walked to the door, her painful face, thunder struck down, after examining the relics, she cried against the door, sad and shocking, and the pace of the door gap before the marriage proposal were two excellent treatments.</p>
<p>Greer Garson is acting in this role instead of Garbo, and I believe Garbo is probably not as calm as her. Walter Pidgeon's Curie is lifelike, vivid and just right, giving full play to his talents, Robert Walker, who plays the assistant, and Van Johnson, who plays the reporter, were still newcomers at the time, and now they have become famous.</p>

<h3>Calligraphy of Master Hongyi</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiangyao</p>
<p>In his early years, the Master often wrote ink by boat, and everyone knew that he could obtain the essence of the ancients; in modern times, he created a unique style of calligraphy, and everyone also knew that he had the aura of not eating human fireworks; however, few people can deeply understand and know the hard work of his skills and the concentration of his spirit. From observing his works, I think that the evolution of the calligraphy style created by the Master in the world seems to have three stages: at first, it was transformed from the study of steles, with a shorter body and more flesh; later, the flesh gradually decreased, the qi gradually converged, and the strength gradually condensed, forming a school that was more square and more regular. In the past two decades, the structure has changed from square regular to slender, the bones and flesh have changed from full to thin and hard, and the charm has changed from deep and majestic to clear and outstanding, forging the expression of his uniquely created whole personality, returning to the truth, surpassing the dust, and entering the wonderful aesthetic realm. What is unattainable is that every stroke is comfortable, every stroke hides the edge, and every stroke converges the spirit. To write this kind of character, one must first gather all the spirit in the heart, and then transport it to the wrist, penetrate it into the pen, and transmit it to the paper. What comes from the heart is a clear heart and a dwelling spirit! Therefore, his writing has a kind of aura of drinking spirit and hiding the edge, the heart is upright and the pen is upright, this is what it means, and it is different from those who casually wave and unrestrainedly. With the Master's character, the Master's spiritual cultivation, and the Master's aesthetic genius, there is the Master's kind of clear spirit flowing and the handsome calligraphy of the lines. This is generally based on what one usually understands and ponders. If based on the experience of my own retreat after spending two weeks imitating the Master's calligraphy the year before, then the most difficult thing to write in the Master's characters is the moment of 收笔 in each stroke. Those who can learn the Master's skill of gathering spirit and hiding the edge when 收笔 can be said to have attained the samadhi of this way.</p>
<p>In short, the vividness of its charm lies in the elegance of the lines; the elegance of the lines lies in the proper operation of Qi and strength; the movement of Qi and strength lies in the peace of mind; from peace of mind to Qi, to writing, to elegant lines, to vivid charm, and to the manifestation of spirit; the spirit of the character comes from the spirit of the person. Therefore, those who cannot learn his intention but want to learn his writing will eventually waste their learning. The "Buddha" character written by the Master, its lines are more and more diligent and resilient. You may be puzzled if I use the word "韧" to describe it. Why did the ancients see snakes fighting and 草法 fire advancing? Because when a snake fights, the place where the strength is used between the head and neck, one extension and one contraction, are all manifestations of the activity of the lines, all manifestations of the spirit of the 機条, and all manifestations of the resilience of the lines. The Master's calligraphy in his later years is becoming more and more tough, and has the strength of softness and firmness, especially not only the bone 清神透 that I discussed. It is also one of the best signs of the sunset's gorgeous yellow错.</p>
<h3>Recording Jianjiang's Remaining Paintings</h3>
<p>— Liang Lieya</p>
<p>Jianjiang Shangren's secular surname is Fang, his name is Tao, his character is Liuqi, and his other name is Hongren. He is known as Mei Hua Gu Na. He was a survivor of the Ming Dynasty and was called Two Mei and Two Wu with his fellow villagers Zha Mei, Wang Wuduan and Sun Wuyi. Together, they were known as the Four Great Masters of Xin'an. He was also called the North and South Two Hongs of the Buddhist family with Fang Yizhi, named Hongzhi (one of the Four Young Masters in the late Ming Dynasty) of Tongcheng. Hongren was a master of sketching Huangshan. His strokes were clear, elegant, sparse, strong, simple, distant, and spiritual. He learned Ni but did not paint Ni, and he learned Mi and changed Mi. Therefore, he was able to surpass the ancients and form his own style. He was the crown of the Four Great Masters and the Two Hongs; he was also the most spiritual calligrapher in black ink since Li in the Ming Dynasty. It is a pity that his legacy is really too little!</p>
<p>Yesterday I read Mr. Xu Shiqi's "Wannan Journey" in the book written by Ben Quan, saying; "On both sides of the tomb road of Mei Hua Gu Na, dozens of plum trees are planted. After combining the sentences, when seeing its cold and solitary beauty in the ice muscles and jade bones, it will embellish the famous mountains. Further up is the tomb of Jianjiang Shangren. Jianjiang is a master of a generation of Xin'an, using fine Chinese labor to write Huangshan, the 　 standard style, unsurpassed at one time. Unfortunately, there are very few works handed down to the world, and it is impossible to ask the people in the town," knowing that Mr. Xu's return to his hometown this time shows deep respect and pursuit for the handwriting of his hometown's ancestors, and he regrets that it is not available in his hometown.</p>
<p>However, I was a guest in the Tangmo Township outside 　zhou City during the Anti-Japanese War (May of the 34th year). Old Mr. Xu Yian (Doubt will be Dong 　, named Chengxiao, a scholar of the Qing Dynasty, good at calligraphy and seal script, once served as the head of the 20th 　 civil administration, 　 repairing Anhui first, excelling in poetry, lyrics, and textual research, collecting ancient books and 　 Dun Shu Huanghua is very rich, and is a close friend of Zhang Taiyan and Zhang Fengzhi in writing articles) in Doukouli, I had the opportunity to admire two pieces of Jianjiang Shangren's left vehicles reduced by the old man of Doubt, which were exquisite, complete, extremely rare, and could be used as the teacher's book of 　 art.</p>
<p>First, it is the Xiaojiang Fengbian Tucuan, about five feet long and six inches high. Shangren himself inscribed in the scroll: "In November of the year of Xinchou, lay resident Boyan will prepare to imitate Guangling, and his friend Shengzhou lay resident Wu Yishan wrote a preface and scholars wrote the Xiaojiang Fengbian Tucuan as a gift." At the end of the scroll, Xu Chu wrote, "Guimao's beginning of autumn, Xin 　　 Xiaoqi, unfolded the scroll and calmed the heart, trying to destroy Qingqiu in the county, rubbing this 　　　." Later, there was a monk named Yiyi who wrote a sentence: "The pen 　 is tall and beautiful, and has been rarely passed down since Yunlin. Jian Gong has learned one change. The public lives in Hai Huangshan, and gets the true nature and temperament of Huangshan, that is, one tree and one stone are the original colors of Qing Huangshan. The style is cold and the life is alive, and there is no one who can do it now! Bingzi Chunguo visited Mr. 　ren in Bangshang and presented this scroll for worship. Each Yuansheng is an ancient connoisseur, and is not inferior to Boyanmei! Qing 　 beer respecter Yuan Ji knows". After I rewarded 　 this scroll. I feel that Jianjiang's distant and nearby landscapes, boat pavilions, and trees are all written with fine and strong complete strokes, creating a scene of morning dawn, wind and harmony. The spirit is beautiful and clean, without dust, making people feel that there is a higher level of thought in life. Therefore, I also said to 看寿 that Jian Gong's ten volumes were obtained from Yunlin's one change sentence. I believe that only those who can truly appreciate it can have such a thorough outpouring of words, and only the true original 　 can get this reputation. Moreover, Mi's Yunshan must use a wet paper and a wet brush, rendering it to create it. Jianjiang used dry paper and a clean brush to 　 paint it, so it is clear, elegant, and has a national style. He has surpassed Sanlin and broken away from Mi, forming his own style and school.</p>
<p>Second, it is a painted screen, six feet high and four feet wide. First, it is coated with white paint as the base, and Shangren used color on the white paint 　　 an old pine, branches 　 supporting horizontally, pine needles sparse and simple, full of charm, the paint color has not changed so far. Whether viewed up close or from afar, it is felt that the soul of that pine tree is alive. The inscription says "Jianjiang scholar writes for the former Zuo resident", with two large seals below, one is "Jianjiang Painting Seal" and the other is "Yun 阭 near people", all filled with red 溙, with an ancient and beautiful typeface. From this lacquer painting, we can know that Chinese painting is not only done with brushes and paper, but also with lacquer, starch, wood, fire, knives, cloth, silk, satin, silk, wood leaves, melon shells, stones, tiles, porcelain, bones, bamboo, mud, 　 and gold, silver, copper, tin, watercolor, etc. to paint, carve, sculpt, even use fingers and finger fields, tongues, etc. to paint. It is a pity that later generations are not willing to study the art left by the ancients and then seek progress, so there are still many people who use brushes, paper, and silk to paint and call it Chinese painting, and use cloth, lacquer, and watercolor to paint and call it Western painting, which seems to be a bit shallow and stubborn!</p>
<h3>Praise for Teng Baiye's Finger Painting</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaowei</p>
<p>In the past, Yang Huizhi and Wu Daozi studied painting from Zhang Sengyao. Huizhi knew that his academic ability could not compete with Daozi, so he retreated and changed to learn sculpture, each with great reputation! From this, we can know that painting and sculpture are closely related in art and have no consistency at the beginning.</p>
<p>Mr. Teng Baiye, an expert in finger painting, was originally named Gui and came from a prominent family in Fengxian County, Jiangsu. He once roamed Europe, specializing in sculpture and dabbling in painting. During his years of studying in Europe, he carefully observed the historical famous inscriptions of France, Italy, and other countries, and thus obtained the spirit of the art of sculpture in that country. After returning to China, he lectured on the beauty of each university and specialized school in the north and south, and sculpted bronze and stone 造偈 for revolutionary veterans and contemporary sages, with lifelike expressions. In particular, before the war, he was selected to sculpt the national father's portrait in Beijing. It is a pity that the construction of the statue was suspended due to the sudden outbreak of the war in the 26th year. This unparalleled masterpiece was not seen by people across the country, which is a pity!</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Teng Jun 　 moved to the rear and traveled between Guilin, Chongqing, and Chengdu. During his travels, he enjoyed the magnificent and beautiful landscapes of the southwestern provinces, and his mood in the 陶中块垒 became more and more 嶔奇! Teng Jun originally worked on finger painting, but before the war, occasionally after tea and wine, when his mood was exuberant, he was teased by his friends and did it occasionally, just for the samadhi of the game. During the War of Resistance, Teng Jun saw the enemy's rampant behavior and the soldiers' bloody battles. His anger was entrusted to finger painting, and his art greatly improved!</p>
<p>Tracing back to the originator of finger painting in our country, everyone always takes Gao Qipei of Tieling as the standard. However, Gao's works are indeed rough and unrestrained and gratifying; after all, they are lost to greed and are slightly inferior to the divine awards in the paintings. Because Gao is a northerner, not the southern sect in Chinese painting, like a beautiful woman, the northern rouge is definitely inferior to the southern dynasty's 金粉. 　 Jun's reason for doing finger painting is that there is no lack of work in landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, insects, and fish, and there is no lack of lifelike expressions! His finger-painted landscapes are similar to Shitao, and easy to make 工致, character lines, learn from 佾县壁绘, quite 平艳可爱; flowers 绘鱼, then his achievements surpass the works of Qing 　 Baiyang笔绘, and make the animals and plants on paper have vitality,栩相然 alive 双通熙伦矣!</p>
<p>Last year's autumn, Teng Jun returned from 　一四 south, and all the collections he carried were finger paintings, which was like carrying the natural scenery of 大技方 with him. After being persuaded by friends in Shanghai, he held a public 胀览; if it were not for the eight years of anti-occupation, Teng Jun's achievements in finger painting would not be so 洋洋大观. A few words read by mistake are used for introduction.</p>
<h3>Flowers and Birds (Finger Painting)</h3>
<p>— Teng Baiye</p>
<h3>To Teng Baiye</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>On the eve of the Lantern Festival in Dinghai, Baiye invited Yu Ming to talk in Shi Qi Huangshan Art Garden. Baiye finger painting on the spot, birds talking and flowers fragrant, completed in one go. The exhibition will be held soon, so I wrote this to show my admiration.</p>
<p>The wonderful hand of sketching comes from your family, (Chinese flower and bird 　 was created in the Five Dynasties, the former 　吴人　 Changyou, was actually the first-class flower painter at that time, Huang Quan once studied under him). The Xu Huang of the Five Dynasties is not enough to boast; 　 荡际　 has intention first, and the spring breeze walks dragons and snakes on paper.</p>
<p>The wrist can參造化功, the finger揮洒趁党雄; different from the ordinary 向新蹊径, suddenly passing the old style of the Gao family.</p>
<h3>The Realistic Spirit in Western Painting History: 19th-Century French Painting Style</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>In early 19th-century French landscape painting, Michel can be considered a representative artist. In the changes in his style, one can sense the shift in landscape painting at that time.</p>
<p>If Michel's landscape paintings are arranged chronologically, they can be broadly divided into three periods. The first period was a time of groping in the dark, following the traditions of Dutch landscape painting. The second period was influenced by English painters, accepting the stimulation of Constable's style. The third period focused on natural and simple sketching, with realism gradually becoming more pronounced.</p>
<p>Centered around the mid-19th century, the era before and after was marked by the opposition of the Classical and Romantic schools, and the rise of the Realist school. The French art world entered a complex period. Therefore, the works of landscape painters who approached nature with sincere emotions inevitably reflected this kind of era character. On one hand, they poeticized trees and symbolized the mystery of forests; on the other hand, they depicted ancient ruins or peasant figures, possessing a dual character.</p>
<p>At that time, there were quite a few artists painting landscapes in France, but the painters with distinctive characteristics were the following four: Corot, Rousseau, Troyon, and Millet. These four had their own styles. Therefore, studying the characteristics of these artists can reveal the style of landscape painting at that time. However, the artistic value and social opinions of these four artists varied.</p>
<p>Among the new group of landscape painters, Corot was particularly outstanding. When he began to learn painting, traditional ideal landscape painters in France occupied a leading position, and their conservative tendencies even refused to acknowledge works that were not adorned with ancient ruins. Corot's travels in Italy and his early representative works, such as sketches of classical-era arenas, can confirm this tendency. However, the work "Crecy," which depicted an ancient arena, had a notable value in its simple and unadorned sketching tendency. Corot maintained this kind of sketching style throughout his long life.</p>
<p>Corot's later works, such as "The Belfry of Vézelay" (depicting the belfry as seen from Rue du Doyenné), retained the same sketching spirit as in his youth, but his painting skills were more skilled and complete than in his youth, approaching the early works of Impressionist painters of his generation.</p>
<p>Corot respected color and drawing in pursuit of harmonious overall effects. He also loved transparent and delicate rhythms. In simple lyrical poems such as transparent and clear watersides trembling in the gentle rhythm of tree shade, forests at sunset, and young women standing by the lake, we can feel his unique sketching style. His paintings never indulged in literary sentimentality, nor did they fall into formalism. His works were always fresh and full of vitality, all of which stemmed from the artistic life generated by Corot's realistic spirit.</p>
<p>If Corot's paintings can be called "lyrical poems of trees," then Rousseau's works should be called "narrative poems of trees." He favored the magnificent scenery of tall trees, treating trees as heroes. This aspect had Rousseau's Romantic nature, but his works also permeated with the spirit of sketching.</p>
<p>Troyon was a painter who inherited the Dutch pastoral landscape painting tradition and specialized in painting livestock. The livestock he painted were vividly integrated with the natural environment. If we travel to the outskirts of France, we are often moved by the beauty of the plowing oxen, and Troyon's pastoral paintings often depict this kind of scenery.</p>
<p>Millet had a significantly different character than the above three. In terms of personal relationships, Millet should belong to the above group of people. However, in terms of artistic trends and the history of French realism, Millet should belong to another system. He was one of the painters who, centered around the February Revolution of 1848, depicted the living environment of the working class, and should be compared with artists such as Daumier and Courbet. However, here we need to examine landscape painters from the perspective of realism, so we will briefly describe Millet's relationship with the three landscape painters based on his personal connections. He began painting peasant paintings after 1848. Since exhibiting a peasant painting at the Salon of that year, he devoted himself to this kind of theme. In terms of technique, his works were somewhat amateurish and lacked strength. As reproductions of photographs, they seemed quite excellent. However, when compared with contemporary masterpieces in the Louvre Museum, they were considerably inferior. However, his historical significance is so highly regarded because he was the first representative artist to depict the living environment of peasants from the perspective of the peasants themselves, and also represented the era's trend of seeking themes in the working class.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Master Hongyi</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Liu Zhiping recently displayed Li Shutong's calligraphy in Shanghai and printed a special issue, containing "Illusory Fate," which narrates the greatness of Master Hongyi. The opening paragraph states, "Literati and artists in the world are most likely to be close to Buddhism. Because these two types of people, residing in the edge of intellect and emotion, easily perceive the world as illusory and realize the impermanence of the world. Therefore, Prince Zhaoming of Liang, who compiled the Selections of Refined Literature, was well-versed in Buddhism. Liu Yanhe, who wrote The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons, even became a monk. Wang Youjun, skilled in calligraphy, and Gu Hutou, skilled in painting, all had extremely deep relationships with Buddhism. Therefore, Li Shutong's becoming a monk is a very natural thing."</p>
<p>We don't need to criticize whether it is right or wrong for artists to become monks, but if a person wants to enter the world, they must bring a detached spirit to seek welfare for the people. They must also feel the impermanence and illusion of life, and issue great aspirations. The Samantabhadra's practices and vows chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra states, "I vow not to attain Buddhahood until I have liberated all sentient beings!" This kind of aspiration is a state of mind that a noble artist should possess. Playing with the beauty of lines and colors without being immersed in sensual pleasures and material gains; preserving precious youth without being decadent and degenerate! The so-called returning to truth and simplicity, and concealing the sharp iron tip, the cultivation of artists is very close to that of Buddha. Now, because of Master Hongyi's completion of enlightenment, we especially raise this issue, which has close connections with human philosophy and world thought, to express our remembrance.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 163</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>As soon as I finished speaking, the phone rang outside. Ji Qun, being closer to the phone and quicker in action, had already picked up the receiver.</p>
<p>"Hello,...Yes,...What?... Qun's voice rose with each word, the last two words high and sharp, indicating extreme surprise. Immediately, she pressed the receiver to her chest, as if afraid we would hear what the other party was saying. She lowered her head, paused for a moment, and then slowly hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>At this moment, the room was extremely silent. The four of us had different expressions, but all of us appeared very nervous. As soon as the room became quiet, we could hear the booming of cannons outside the city, and the intermittent sound of machine guns, mixed with the noisy car horns on the streets, transmitted from the high sky, piercing our ears.</p>
<p>As Qun turned around, the color on her face had changed.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yue," Qun's voice was so low that it was almost inaudible, "The Concord Hospital called..."</p>
<p>"Oh!" He Jian responded sensitively, "Mr. Wu?..."</p>
<p>"Yes!..." Yao Qun replied, "...passed away at three o'clock..."</p>
<p>"How pitiful!" I thought Dingyuan had committed suicide again.</p>
<p>"Is he dead?" He Jian asked, his expression quite frightened.</p>
<p>"Almost the same as dead...He's gone! Left two letters, one for the hospital, thanking them for their preferential treatment; one for Mr. Yue, which the hospital has sent someone to deliver. It is said that someone saw Mr. Wu heading west, presumably out of the city."</p>
<p>"Impossible," He Jian insisted on his own view, "According to the phone call I received this morning, Matsui said that tonight he would pacify Puqing and Beiping. Xizhimen and Xibianmen are now experiencing fierce battles. How could Mr. Wu get out of the city?" As He Jian spoke, he had already pressed the doorbell to call someone.</p>
<p>"That just proves that Mr. Wu went to his death! Doesn't it?" Qun's face became even paler.</p>
<p>"No. 04" was standing solemnly in front of the door again.</p>
<p>"Old Brother, does 'No. 04' know Mr. Wu?" He Jian asked me.</p>
<p>"Yes," I quickly replied.</p>
<p>"Old Shen," He Jian said to "No. 04," "Take the special badge and armband, lead four people, drive a military vehicle, first go to the Concord Hospital, find out clearly what clothes and hat Mr. Wu, the engineer who just left, was wearing, what color, remember it specifically; then follow the trail – go out of the city through Xizhimen. If you encounter the National Army, hide the symbols; if you encounter the Japanese Army, reveal the symbols. Call back at any time, regardless of whether you find him or not. Target: Changxindian; preferably return to the unit by 8:00 PM!"</p>
<p>As soon as "No. 04" heard He Jian issue the order, he immediately pulled out a small notebook and recorded everything. After He Jian finished issuing the order, "No. 04" also finished recording. Then, following the outline he had recorded, he reread it to He Jian to avoid errors. This was a procedure that trained special agents would definitely have. Unfortunately, "No. 04" had a stutter. When rereading, he struggled so much that his eyeballs seemed about to explode. He Jian's nature suddenly became as fierce as fire when he encountered emergencies. Seeing "No. 04" stammering so much, he couldn't bear it, so he walked over, snatched "No. 04's" notebook, and inspected it himself. After inspecting, he determined that there were no omissions, and immediately returned it to "No. 04," waving his hand, signaling "No. 04" to leave quickly.</p>

<h3>Everywhere is War, But Overseas There is a Peach Blossom Spring: May the Peach Blossom Spring Be Forever Young</h3>
<p>— Wu Hong</p>
<p>In this greedy, cruel, power-grabbing, selfish, and profit-oriented world, every day, everywhere, for a "private property" concept of humanity, but recently on the southeastern sea of ​​Taiwan Island, Such a paradise was found, very similar to Tao Yuanming's "Peach Blossom Spring" and the Western philosopher's "Utopia".</p>
<p>Fifty-six miles from Taitung and forty miles from Green Island, there is a small island called "Hongtouyu", which is now the easternmost territory of our country. There are a total of 1,275 residents on the island, all Malay aborigines, who still live a primitive life. Men work naked, working at sunrise and resting at sunset, living in groups, and there is no concept of "private property".</p>
<p>The island is rich in "Five-Leaf Butterfly Orchid", which is the world-famous unique product. Since it was discovered by the Taiwan Provincial Government, some people mistakenly believed that the original name of the island, "Hongtou", contained the meaning of "red worms and poison", and it was necessary to carry out "development" work. The Taiwan Provincial Government decided to rename it "Orchid Island" to match the island's special product "Five-Leaf Butterfly Orchid". Orchid Island and Hongtouyu both belong to the two towns of Taitung County.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in our "such and such" country, there is still such a quaint and admirable "Utopia". While feeling fortunate, the author only hopes that the island will not push forward its lovely original appearance after being "developed".</p>
<p>May the Peach Blossom Spring be forever young</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Underground World</h3>
<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>The rice price, which had been quiet for a long time, has recently fluctuated again. It has been soaring up and up, so people who maintain a living with meager salaries have become anxious; but in Shanghai there is a problem of manure, which is actually as crucial as the grain problem, but has never aroused special attention from Shanghai people. It is just like how the current society values ​​embellishing the surface very well and neglects the most basic work in reality. However, if one day the "way out" of all the people in Shanghai must be temporarily "stockpiled", the result will definitely make everyone feel that this matter is more serious than the food problem. You should know that Shanghai's "export" volume of manure is more than the "import" volume of rice.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "manure" is a fertilizer for growing fields. If you have your own field in the countryside, you can use it to fertilize the field. If you don't have a field, you can at least exchange some vegetables for food. But in Shanghai, I'm sorry, not only do you have to let the old masters pour away bucket after bucket for free every day, but at the end of the month, you have to pay several thousand yuan, if you don't pay, they won't pour it. As a citizen, you can argue about other things, but you can't force it when you encounter this kind of thing. If they leave it there for two or three days, it will be enough for you to suffer. Therefore, there is a 100% reason for the existence of manure pourers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The entire Shanghai has four to five million manure-making machines, and the result of all-day production is naturally a huge number. Just from the more than 2,000 manure carts in the city, each cart clearing one or two hundred toilet buckets of inventory, you can get a glimpse of the mass production of manure in Shanghai. The manure pourers generally set off with their carts at three or four in the morning. Although they are dressed in rags, they always wear several shiny gold rings on their hands. When they come to collect money at the end of the month, some are even dressed in suits and leather shoes, their style completely different from when they were pushing the cart in the morning. The wealth of manure pourers is something that ordinary civil servants cannot hope to compare with.</p>
<p>As for the manure produced, several piers are parked with ships waiting to buy it. Manure dealers搶 buy the manure from the central district, because the people living in the central district seem to be always richer, and if they are rich, they eat well, and the manure produced is naturally more oily. There are also several gangs of manure dealers at the manure dock, such as Songjiang, Jiangbei, local, etc. In order to grab good manure, they often put on a full martial arts performance, and the scalpers are even more ubiquitous in "擺道子",燕舞鶯歌 pay tribute, can guarantee you buy good manure, so in addition to buying manure at the official price, it is better to "insert extra flowers" to drop some small money.</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai's manure was contracted by the manure king, and none of those who did this business failed to make a fortune. Before the manure business was handled by the authorities, Shanghai successively produced many manure kings, living in foreign houses and sitting in cars, and even raising several concubines, behaving extravagantly; this kind of luxury is enough to show that manure is not only the same color as gold, but its value is also equal. However, now the manure king has finally disappeared, leaving only a group of people who are營想 to be the future manure king.</p>
<p>In addition to being poured away by the manure pourers, Shanghai's "manure" has many people who use flushing toilets or defecate in public pits. Although Shanghai has many public pits, sometimes it is also felt that the distribution of these public pits is uneven and insufficient, so at one time someone in Puan Road and other places opened public toilet companies—private pits, mostly a dilapidated house along the street with a few uncovered toilets inside, using the foul smell released to do advertising, male and female guests walked in without asking whether you brought toilet paper or not, you must pay hundreds of yuan for toilet paper before being allowed to take a seat. This kind of private pit receives hundreds of customers every day, with a bustling door, but it is suffering for the nearby residents, who are enjoying suffocating ozone all the time, but most of these private pits have now disappeared.</p>
<h3>An American Bride in England</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>A slender American girl, with a head of long red hair, steadily stepped out of the plane with her legs wearing glass stockings and stepped onto British soil.</p>
<p>With a smiling face, she underwent immigration and customs inspections, walked to our streets, and began her new life as a British housewife.</p>
<p>When she arrived at her new home, she showed her "true colors" within a few hours, giving each of her female relatives two pairs of glass stockings that they didn't have – or almost didn't have! (Customs, unexpectedly, allowed her fifteen pairs of glass stockings to be tax-free).</p>
<p>She came from a relatively wealthy country to a country where everything had to be rationed. She came from a spacious modern American house to a dilapidated bungalow (which her brother had tried his best to find for her).</p>
<p>There was no car in the garage, no refrigerator in the kitchen, and no electric mixers, baking ovens, washing machines, or floor cleaners.</p>
<p>On the first day, she saw housewives lined up in a long queue on "High Street" waiting to buy bananas, so she joined the queue. Twenty minutes later, she became the first person and said to the clerk, "Thank you, I'll buy some bananas." But when the clerk replied, "Sorry, madam, no bananas without a ration card," her face turned red and she quietly fled.</p>
<p>One day, she hung six pairs of glass stockings on her clothesline at once, causing people all over the street to point and whisper.</p>
<p>"I guess this is because most British women treasure their last two pairs of top-of-the-line nylon stockings," she later told people.</p>
<p>Other things that the bride found "really interesting" were: the butcher selling her meat once a week with two "purchase registration books"; buying a pound of very small potatoes from a grocery store after standing in a long queue for ten minutes; ironing her sheets and John's shirts with a small shared iron; eating cream cake made with cooked fruit. (Translated from the January issue of "Britain Magazine")</p>

<h3>Current Serious Social Problems in the United States</h3>
<p>— United Press Special Report Translated by the Editorial Department of this newspaper</p>
<p>The judge said: '...Too much money is a major cause of divorce, because people who make "war money" are satiated and think of lust, and can no longer tolerate their wives who have suffered with them.'</p>
<p>According to the survey, the number of divorce cases in the United States in 1946 broke the highest record and continued to increase. Taking several major cities as an example, the number of divorce cases in the past year all set new records in history.</p>
<p>Judges handling divorce cases have put forward many reasons to explain this divorce boom, one of which is the wartime marriage that was hastily combined. However, another part of the judges blamed too much money earned during the war.</p>
<p>Indulgence of public opinion</p>
<p>Other reasons are housing panic, cramped living conditions, indulgence of public opinion on divorce, decline of religious forces, and veterans not accustomed to family life, etc.</p>
<p>A judge said: "Of the couples who got together during the war, four out of five end in divorce." Another judge said: "Often a couple encounters by chance, falls in love at first sight, and marries that day." Another judge said: "Cases of divorce due to wife beating are more and more frequent every day. In addition, 'too much money' is also a major cause of divorce. Because people who make war money are satiated and think of lust, and can no longer tolerate their wives who have suffered with them."</p>
<p>Reno, the capital of divorce cases in the United States, had a total of 11,000 divorce cases in 1946, breaking the record of 8,500 cases in 1945. The total number of divorce cases in the entire state of Nevada, to which the city belongs, also set a new record of 20,000 cases. A local judge in Reno said: "As far as I can see, the number of divorce cases in 1947 will definitely be even higher."</p>
<p>Alarming numbers</p>
<p>From July 1, 1945 to July 1, 1946, the total number of divorce cases in New York State was 19,895, compared to only 13,071 in the previous year. It is expected that there will be a continuous increase in the second half of 1946. The divorce rate in Chicago was 17,046, and although the divorce rate in Los Angeles and Hollywood has not yet been released, the authorities believe that the number in 1946 must be a new record.</p>
<p>Should the divorce law be abolished?</p>
<p>The surge in divorce cases across the United States has prompted the authorities in some states to take certain preventive measures. Donlan, a member of the Boston House of Representatives in Massachusetts, once proposed a bill in the state legislature to abolish the state's divorce law.</p>

<h3>The Woman Behind the European Powder Keg: Ruling Bulgaria</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jia Yuan</p>
<p>The Balkan Peninsula is Europe's powder keg, as it was in the past and still is today. Currently, apart from parts of Greece and Turkey, the real power in the remaining countries of the peninsula is effectively in the hands of the Soviet Union. However, what methods does the Soviet Union use to control these countries, making them newly submissive within its sphere of influence, not daring to overstep? Some say it relies on the Red Army, and others say it relies on large-scale political secret agents. This is certainly true, but in addition to the Red Army and secret agents, it also relies on several outstanding women.</p>
<p>In Bulgaria, if you secretly inquire, "Who is the actual ruler of Bulgaria?" the answer you will get is: "Tsola Dragoycheva." This forty-six-year-old veteran communist, currently the Secretary-General of the Fatherland Front National Committee, possesses supreme power. She seems to hold a whip, ruling Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Once Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Speaking of Tsola's background, it is quite thrilling. There was a time when she was a nationally renowned beauty, her hair emitting a fiery red glow, and her eyes were blue. In the past, she was arrested for plotting to overthrow the dictatorial regime of King Boris of Bulgaria and had been sentenced to death. But the reason she did not die is a miracle. It turned out that six days before her execution, she suddenly requested the jailer to conduct a physical examination. The jailer didn't care much, thinking that for a prisoner with only six days to live, checking her body would be somewhat unnecessary and ridiculous, and finally casually agreed. However, the examination proved that she was pregnant, and according to Bulgarian law, pregnant women cannot be executed, so the court had to change the death sentence to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Tsola's child was born in prison. She lived in prison with the child who "saved her life," gaining the most intimate knowledge of the situation in Bulgarian prisons. Tsola had a great reputation in prison, so the government did not move her to different prisons. The mother and child spent ten years living in constant transfers, knowing nothing about the outside world, but her intense personality did not change.</p>
<p>Lurking Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Later, Bulgaria granted an amnesty, and Tsola was released from prison but exiled abroad. She went to Moscow, where she met Georgi Dimitrov, the founder of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Dimitrov immediately recognized her as promising material and trained her in preparation for leading a coup in Bulgaria in the future. Then, the Soviet-German war broke out, and in 1942, she parachuted dramatically into Bulgarian territory and began to carry out strict organizational work within Bulgaria. When the Fatherland Front group overthrew the last Nazi puppet regime on September 9, 1944, the government had no difficulty in taking over the work, all thanks to Tsola's past achievements. From then on, she became the behind-the-scenes string-puller of the ruling elites, using her iron fist to effectively rule Bulgaria, a country adjacent to Greece and Turkey and of great strategic significance.</p>
