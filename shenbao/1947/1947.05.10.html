<h3>行政院檢討會決定調整軍公人員待遇　經委會今商議物價問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕公敎人員待遇調整之原則，業經九日上午十時舉行之政院政務檢討會中決定，是項辦法亦經通過，惟尙待政院會計處硏究統計調整後之預算總額後，由財部衡量實情，於十三日政院例會中通過；故此項辦法所決定之數額，各方均未透露。政務檢討會散後僅由新聞局局長董顯光作如下之公吿：「關於文武職公敎人員待遇及工資問題，今日政院檢對會提出，決自本月起參照實際情形調整，於下星期二政務會議決定」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕全國經委會物價委會，定十日九時討論當前物價問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕聞當局爲吸收游資，考慮由國家銀行舉辦短期儲畜，期限一年或六個月，利息優厚。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京九日電〕據悉，僑務委員會不久將成立華僑經濟局，以勸導並協助華僑向國內投資。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕政委蔣勻田九日夜車赴滬。蔣氏所倡改革目前之經濟政策，九日尙未在政務檢討會議（即路透社所稱之特別會議）中提出。蔣氏今吿記者謂，尙待與若干人士研究後，再行提出。同時蔣氏以乘汽車爲例，强調廢止外匯管制後，匯率過高時，汽車不得進口，吾人即可普遍安步當車。</p>
<p>管制外匯似有必要整理幣制尙非其時</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕據曾參加敦巴頓橡樹會議之某經濟專家九日語記者：在目前情况下，欲將外匯匯率廢止，恐有各種不便，對當前經濟情勢亦不一定有所補益。渠鄭重指出，國家管制外匯爲不得已之事，尤其在對外貿易上，有此必要；蓋大戰之後，損失慘重，出口困難而入口需要增加，欲謀國際收支平穩，勢非從管制外匯入手不可，若予放任，不特黃金資源受損失，資金亦紛紛外逃。國際收支必形成逆流。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕各方對改革幣制事，極爲注意，記者九日訪某經濟權威，據談：整理幣制極有必要，然在目前而遽行改革幣制則尙非其時。渠指出，欲謀改革幣制，必先具備各種客觀條件，俾於幣制改革後，新幣幣値必能維持穩定。據稱：各國在改革幣制前，　經一個長時期之整理，先求幣値穩定，就法國而論，幣値自一九二六年起即趨穩定，然至一九二八年始改革幣制。英國情形亦復如此。該國恢復金本位，亦係幣値穩定後相當時期始予實行。記者詢以德國利用外國借款整理幣制，我國是否亦可採用此種方式，渠認兩國情形不能相提並論，德國當時所遇之困難，主要為外來壓力，外國貸予一筆鉅款後，幣制問題即可解決，而我國目前所遭遇之困難，內在困難實較外來壓力為大，情况旣有不同，處理方法必須各異。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕行政院長張羣，九日在參會報吿後，參政院傳斯年首起質詢，力主嚴懲不法官吏，以一儆百，渠强調稱：「政府爲何要貸款與申新兩棉紡廠，且向聯總購買之棉價爲七十萬元一件，而賣出則漲至一百五十萬元」。關於米糧問題，傅亦認爲滬市辦理未能盡善，配售未能普遍做到，反被奸商套購操縱，政府對此，實應採硬幹，快幹手段，以平民僨。繼尹述賢對中糧公司處理民食一事亦有意見，認爲不當，影饗目前物價，且聞該公司每一科長均有汽車，並主張政府應予嚴査，張對質詢曾作簡略答覆。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京九日電〕張羣院長囊參政會駐會委員會報吿稱，唯國家統一時，人民生活始有適當保障。渠贊成日用必需品配售辦法及政府繼續津貼公用事業，防其漲價，而免對人民生活程度，發生不利影響。目前公務人員薪俸月達一百四十億元，軍隊官兵餉銀月約三千億元。</p>

<h3>我餘鹽輸日問題　財部發言人談實際情形自用倘無餘量即停運日</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕年來我國工業界及社會各方面對餘鹽輸日問題，均甚爲重視。財部發言人頃對此事發表如下談話；</p>
<p>（一）我國鹽產情形：我國產鹽甚多，向來產浮於銷，本年全國各區鹽塲產量可達三百萬噸，除供給全國食需及工晨漁業用鹽約二三〇萬噸外，賸餘約有八十萬噸。</p>
<p>（二）輸日全係餘鹽，賸餘之鹽最好是　國內工業用鹽，政府對於工業用鹽極力提倡，現均一律免　供應，但去年全國實放工業　鹽不過六萬餘噸，難以容納　　餘鹽，而餘鹽皆係鹽民所產製，不能不謀出路，以維持製民生計，所以自去年以來，始將餘鹽輸日，今年輸日餘鹽，全年最高額擬定爲五十萬噸，上半年擬輸日十五萬噸，餘鹽八十萬噸，並未全數輸出，尙儲存一部份爲國內之用。</p>
<p>（三）日鹽對於目前經濟上之利益，以賸餘無用之鹽換取目前急需之物資，如交通木材，礦產木材，絲業等，一方面旣能維持鹽民之生計，一方面又可以節省鉅額之外匯，充實肚會之經濟，其利益實甚大。</p>
<p>（四）日本工業之恢復與我國餘鹽輸日無關，日本現在盟軍管制之下，其工業應否恢復及應恢復至如何程度，全由盟軍主持與我國餘鹽輸日無關。現在日本已訂購英國之菲洲紅海鹽四十萬噸，由英自備輪船運日交貨，每噸價美金十五元七，由此可以證明我國即不將餘鹽輸日日本亦可在其他方面購得用鹽復興工業，而我國徒喪失國際貿易之機會，損失經濟上多方之利益，豈不可惜？故餘鹽亟應爭取機會輸日易貨。</p>
<p>（五）我國工業如果發達，輸日鹽自可停止，輸日之鹽全係　餘，已如上所言，如果我國因鹽工業發達需用工業靈則增加自用，儘先儘量供給，如全國所產之鹽國內均能行銷，並無賸餘，輸日鹽自可隨時停止。</p>
<h3>國軍緊縮包圍圈向萊蕪地區推進　濟南至魯西公路交通即可恢復</h3>

<p>自兵役法公怖施行後，全國各地方，除綏靖區及黄河讯區外，莫不依法實行徵兵，唯有上海市延綏未行。以言職責，上海市政府有民政處，而民政處又設右軍事科專司其事；國防部又於上海設置師團管區司令部，均爲兵役行政機關。以言桃費。本年度上海市　出入總預算，經常歲出的兵役經费，爲一八四·八八一·一四〇元，此外尙有師團管區的國防事務支出费用。以言人口，上海市人口有四百萬以土，據民政處去年十月的調查：十八歲至廿盡的男子，有九九·一三一七八人；廿至廿五歲的男子，有二三一·五三·八人；廿五至卅歲的男子一一三·五五〇人；卅至卅五歲的男子，有一九四·九九六人；卅五至四十歲的男子，有一七九·〇四五人；四十至四十下歲的男子，有一五六·七九一人。　情論理，上海市實施兵役的倏件很　　，井且上海熟心好義的士衆多。如赏施兵役，籌募優待經費，微集慰勞物資，亦較其他地方優越。有此主觀的客觀的條件，上海徵兵應順利推行，依法辨理，必獲成功！</p>
<p>上海市因徵兵之久滯未行，鄰近省縣鄉里的人民，以爲上海情形特殊，可以逃避兵役。於是半年以米，上海人口激增，户籍混亂，逃避兵役者扮粉獲取職位。因人口增加，房屋缺乏，消費擴大，食糧物價，一致飛騰，影響社會安寗秋序，影響治安機關之管制。此種珑象演變下去，非上海煽動會的幸福，乃是潜伏在　於上海社會。今大的上海，解决失業简题人口問题是一回事，解抉整個社會是一回事，而徽兵必須及早推行，逃避兵役集中都市必須處罰，這不僅可以輔助社會問題的解块，並可消弭社官的紛亂與不安。要之，今大的上海，社會問題和兵役同题，已發生聯带，所以解块兵役問題，即爲社會問題的解诀。這一點，希望行政當局及社會人士，必須認識，必須注意。</p>
<p>現在合齡狀丁身家調查，已在進行之中，這僅是兵役處理的開始。調查是消極的，體格極查和抽簽徽集，牽涉法律部門，及人民身份的確定。辦理必須要慎难，審查必須要依法。因此，兵役法施行佚第卅兰條，規定組織的兵役協會，亦應由社會賢達，出而倡導，從協助兵农到監督兵役，無論檢查抽簽，無論免緩役審查，均務求公正公平，合理哈法。上海爲中外人士集中之區，對於徽兵的辫理，莫不于以注視，希望内地辦理兵役的臭惡，窮鄉僻境推行兵役的流弊，不要發生於上海。</p>
<p>要之，上海辦理兵役的條件優越，行政當局應有負責勇氣·立志決心将上海兵役辦好，爲全國樹立示範，而移轉全國的風氣，以收風行草偃之效，此其時矣。順上海市當局及社會人士，努力圖之！</p>

<h3>艾克遜主張切實推行　美對外援助計劃　安定世界此舉實屬必要　協助德日復興使為歐亞利益工作</h3>
<p>〔路透社密西西比州克里夫蘭八日電〕副國務卿艾克遜今日在此發表演說稱：在世界各國得以自力支持以前，世界當無政治上及經濟上之穩定，任何人均不能有持久之和平與繁榮。職是之故，美國必須繼續施行其大規模之對外援助計劃至數年之久。許多國家若無外界之援助，將需要極長久之時間始能復興，失望及沮喪之心情必隨之以起。在此等情形下自由民主及獨立，決不能長期生存。飢寒交迫瀕於絕望之人，衹有挺而走險之一途，故在世界人民得以暖衣足食，對未來得有若干信任以前，戰爭決無從絕跡。本年度美國之進口衹能及出口之半，於此乃發生若干國際關係中最重要之問題。其他國家如何能獲取美元以補此項鉅額之入超，而明年甚至後年，可能仍有類似之入超，此等國際生活上之事實，對於美國及美國之外交政策究具有何種意義，其意乃我美國人民必須採取措施，以使世界之需要與支付能力間之距離，儘量縮小，其間決無機會主義，此乃普通常識而已。吾人今日乃以本身利益爲前提，而負有補足世界預算不足之義務。艾克遜繼曰：美國對外國作復興建設之援助時，當以力岡抵抗內部或外部之極權壓力，以維護其獨立民主制度及人類自由之自由民族爲優先對象。再者，外國若繼續於一九四八年及一九四九年自外購買維持生活及扳興經濟所必需之物，必須由美國繼續予以緊急財政援助。美國必須積極推進德日兩國之復興，此乃歐亞兩洲之大工廠，兩大陸之復興，均有賴於該兩國之復興。歐洲各部經濟之和諧合作，爲歐洲復興之基本條件，此乃美國外交政策之基本目標。艾克遜又曰：日內瓦之貿易會議務必使其成功，不但係因仳界今日緊急之供應及財政狀况之故，更因美國爲世界最大之生產國及債權國，故必須得在長期內有大量進口之獲得。艾氏最後曰：消滅經濟崩之力量不僅爲美元貸款，更急需小麥煤斤及鋼鐵。</p>

<h3>最高法院撤銷原判　决聞半亭案發回更審　出任偽職係奉密令　認聲請人指摘原判不當為有理由</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕聞蘭亭案前經滬高院於去歲九月十二日判決，聞不服原判上訴。茲經最高法院覆判，判決主文，「原判決撤銷，發回上海高等法院更爲審理。」主要理由如次：原審因聲請人參加僞組織，憑藉敵僞勢力，爲有利於敵僞，不利於本國之行爲，依懲治漢奸條例第三條，適用同條例第二條第一項第一款處斷，顯不能謂爲無據。惟査中國國民黨中央執行委會中央調査統計局函載：「於民國三十一年一月據嵇希宗同志密報，工作環境日見困難，並提及聞蘭亭居滬有年，人地熟悉，擬與接洽，俾資掩護。當密令准其前往洽商，担任掩護，並便利情報等事。爲堅敵信計，商准參加僞市商會，担任偽監事長。復於卅二年二月敵僞組織商統會實施經濟統制時，本局據報後，爲破壞其統制陰謀，即密令嵇同志，轉令聞蘭亭出任商統會監事長。同意聞蘭亭出任僞棉統會主任委員。三十二年六月間，僞方迫令聞蘭亭接任僞商統會理事長，亦經轉電同意」。即聲請人在原審審判中，亦稱：「本人所做的事務，是奉中央命令，更不是漢奸。」果聲請人之出任僞職，係奉命令混入，從事反間諜之工作，固不無刑法第廿一條第二項前段之適用，第査此項事實聲請，却在軍委會調査統計局及原審偵査中，並無一語道及是否於參加僞職後，始担任策反及搜集情報等工作。且査米業統制會供給日寇軍米，旣據聲請人供稱：「經僞行政院命令每年大約「二百萬担」，此項命令顯有利於敵偽。聲請人出任商統會理事長時，曾否爲之承轉，令飭米統會供給，均不無疑義。原審未予轉訊嵇希宗，並調取有關卷證，詳予硏求，遽行判決，於審判上職權調査之能事，實有未盡。申請覆判意旨執此指摘原判不當，自難謂無理由，應認爲有發回更審之原因。據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第廿二條第一項但書，判決如主文。</p>
<h3>分區計口授糧辦法　參議會請迅籌實行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會社會委員會昨舉行第十三次會議，討論提案多件。關於無錫縣參議會代電中央解凍生活指數一案，該會亦決議建議中央從速議訂關於解凍生活指數合理辦法。又社會局請指派物價評議委員案，決議推張中原參加食米組，周廉澤參加食糖組，黄振世參加麵粉組，姚抱眞燃料組，邵永生紗布組，袁召辛食油組。另請市府辦理者如：（一）迅籌分區計口授糧辦法，於最短期內實行。（二）轉呈行政院令飭交通部確定京滬路貨運營業所性質並改善承攬貨運業務。（三）市民建議立即査禁或焚毁連環圖畫，以免兒童心靈受害，請交社會局參考。</p>
<h3>配售食米問題議長發表談話</h3>
<p>市參議會潘議長昨向記者發表談話稱：最近數日，本會爲求明瞭各區地方自治行政推行情形及其應興應革事宜起見，曾分區邀請各區區民代表會主席及正副區長舉行座談會，先後共計七次，已於昨日圓滿結束。各區出席人員，對於民食問題，提供意見特多，歸納言之如下：（一）自市府採取憑戶籍證購買平價米辦法以米，各區咸感供不應求，不免糾紛迭起，故仍望當局寬籌來源，增加各區之配額。（二）最近市府將採取之新措施，聞擬儘先以本市工人，公敎人員及貧民爲對象，配售食米，此事用意頗合情理，雖尙在硏究，然各方咸盼早日實施，惟據各區意見，感覺所謂貧民之定義，似應有指示範圍，以免流弊。郊區市民雖大都務農，但浦東各區及大塲·江灣·吳淞·龍華，除一部份係種植蔬菜外，類皆種植棉花小麥等旱作，並不產稻，食米仍多仰賴於市區供給，且郊區亦不乏客籍貧民，是以甚望當局處理糧食問題，能將郊區與市區作同等之重視。上述兩點，均爲事實，本人非常同情。政府在極度困難之際，應付糧潮，儘先以貧困階級爲供應對象，在原則上未可厚非，祗須縝密計劃，辦事得人，及全市市民之共同合作，效果自屬可期，但治本之道，仍須一面由當局加緊寬籌本市米源，及嚴厲取締阻撓運輸及囤積居奇之徒，以暢貨運，一面須賴市民共守秩序，使社會安定，正當米商有經營本業之可能，否則糾紛迭起，徒擾人心，於米價之抑平，固絲毫無補也云。</p>

<h3>露得園路羣衆搶米被捕豐功厚利上人准交保</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南市露香園路一一六號同鑫米店，昨晨七時即有市民前往購米，該號深恐被搶，拒不開門。至十一時許購米民衆越集越多，即有人高呌，「米店囤米不售，家中已無餘粒，中飯如何解決」，於是衆羣一擁上前，打開米店大門，結果搶去白粳廿石，糙米八石。警局聞報前往彈壓，並拘獲賀阿元，唐生根，周志芳，郭林氏，馬采英，吳林寳，匡金聲，陳金土，紀振華，邵皇堂，蔣金土，張財榮，施源福，汪文生等十四人。警局即於下午五時解送地檢處，當由檢察官開庭，十四人皆否認搶米，有謂路過，有謂擬往購戶口米，庭諭一律暫准交保候訊。</p>

<h3>法學院等長表齊集市府請願</h3>

<p>仕餘敗於征輪今日戰京美軍</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕上海仁餘籃球除九日在京第二戰與洛陽遠征軍征輪隊相遇，滬隊因不慣戶外作戰，健將王槐庭又受傷，致以十二比廿五之比數慘敗。兩隊去歲曾一度在滬相遇，當時仁餘獲捷，今日重逢，賽來益見緊張，比數亦極逼近。第一節比數爲一比三，可見競爭激烈一般，上半時九比四，下半時征輪一路領先，仁餘全隊以徐仲已姚文彝　演最爲出色，惜球運不佳，投籃多不中鵠，不然當不致負分如此多，總結果廿五比十二，該隊十日將與美軍相遇。</p>

<p>華股昨恐怖氣氛濃重，借款消息更濃，生產貸款亦有收轉之訊，港匯復推渡助瀾，全塲除一二種未停外，十之八九再吿跌至限度。</p>
<p>晨開人心仍怯，中絲美亞首先跌停，遞永紗開後，賣方缺乏對手，即　五六〇〇元摻跌至五四〇〇元內，始有成交。旋被再賣到六二五〇元，現永紗已吿跌停，惟趁低有納，尙能升至五五〇〇元外。時新亞亦跌停，逢高脫手者，不乏其人，但一般心理，對牌價更改，仍有傳說，遂再升至五六七〇元。九四號五二號一四五號一七九號三六號紛售，水泥及永紗再吿跌停，近午回降至五三〇〇元。一四一號二〇二號一四號趁低仍納，午收尙穩，收後喊價微升。</p>
<p>結果較前收計勤　平平，信和新光新華景福微挫，永公跌一成強，永紗美亞跌停。遞交計美亞跌停，新光微升，永公跌一成，信和景福微降，永紗勤興跌半成。冷股計景綸跌一成弱，榮豐水泥火柴中紡跌停後有回，中絲新亞大通跌停，餘各跌半成左右。</p>
<p>午後　聞夜報載有宋孔將奉派赴美商治借款之訊，二二三號上塲即賣，遞永紗開出即停，暗市喊低至四九〇〇元左右，全塲除火柴及小熱外，幾全部跌停。一四號四號一四五號三六號六一號二二四號一〇五號來進，火柴忽有大衆吸納，拉上至漲停。遞永紗回漲到五三〇〇元光景。各小股及信和亦被帶上，一六三號一八〇號二二四號一五九號二四號等再賣，臨收仍將遞永紗迫低至五一〇〇元光景結束。結果較前收計永紗美亞跌停，信和新光永公景福勤興跌停後有圓，各降一成有零。新華跌一成強。遞交計永紗美亞跌停，信和永公新光景福跌停有回，勤興下午無成交。冷股計商務中紡統益大通中絲景綸水泥新亞跌停，火柴由跌停而再升至漲停（未成交），結果升半成强，五和跌半成强。塲外各股計大生一三廠平穩，餘者微降迄跌一成餘不等。</p>
<p>外股續跌</p>
<p>外股昨　續下瀉，證劵帮及錢兌業均加了結，北帮及廣帮雖納，無濟於事，銀行帮對航業英聯怡紗及橡皮股略加垂靑。聞祥茂洋行所發行之橡皮股，已可過戶。怡紗自晨初七六〇〇〇元，逐步下降，午後申電報升，更爲不支，怡紗退至五五五〇〇元，英聯九三〇〇〇元，會德體二一〇，〇〇〇元，電話四四〇〇〇元，業廣三三〇〇〇元，紙業一六〇〇〇元，怡碑二一〇〇〇活，航業一三五〇〇元，鋼業二一〇〇〇元，開平七四〇〇〇元，墾植二二〇〇〇元之低價結束。結果較前收計怡啤會德豐跌一成半强，鋼業紙業跌一成强，怡紗一成半弱，餘微降迄一成弱不等。</p>

<h3>搶風尙未戢止　全市米號仍停業　吳市長囑米商從速恢復買賣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米問題極爲嚴重，米商因連日搶風甚盛，多不敢買賣。昨日全市各米店一致暫停營業。市長爲此特諭稱：各米號門售配給米，已飭令憲警妥加保護。如門售配米不便，可與警察局及區公所商借地址，聯合分配。全市米號務須照常營業，搶米份子當予嚴辦。米商如有意見，可由米號業公會轉達。市長諭下後，各米商因鑒於昨日仍有搶米事件發生，深感生命財產之不能保障，故仍未遵令復業。</p>
<p>昨晨九時，吳市長在市府召見米商業同業公會理事長瞿振華，囑以維持民食爲重，勸吿全體米商安心營業。瞿氏當代多數米商轉達意見，要求援成都無錫等地搶米者格殺勿論之例，對本市搶米者予以重懲。吳市長允予拘辦。米商代表並報吿：五日下午楊樹浦萬興錫記米號之被搶，係由第二十區十五保保長曹宏雲所領導發動，要求予以嚴懲。市長聞訊後即諭令民政處長張曉崧加以澈査。</p>
<p>要示先領米售罄再付款</p>
<p>米商對經售配米事，聲稱目前大多資金短絀，要求准予先領米，待售罄後再行繳款，並稱敵偽時期之經售配米亦且如此。吳市長對此點未置可否，但允予考慮。</p>
<p>據米業負責人蝗晚與記者談：各米商情續激昂，頗難控制。彼等因感生命財產之無保障，多不敢開門營業。目前亟盼瀋議長能設法解決此一米潮問題。</p>
<p>昨日北市塲交易完全停頓，南市塲則略有做開。到貨共四六三石，社局照例於南市塲拋售九千包，初各米商均不敢配領，後經吳市長召見米商代表允於門售配米時，派警保護，各米商始額配領，市塲白粳高貨喊廿九萬五千元，中貨廿八萬五千元。薄稻高貨廿九萬二千先，中貨廿八萬四千元。年秈中　　廿八萬元。　秈中貨廿五五千元。白元中貨廿九萬元。</p>
<h3>中央銀行函請查禁申匯套利</h3>
<p>報載漢商有申匯套利情事，係由漢口將大鈔帶往廣州，僅交七百八十萬元，即可在上海支付一千萬元，中央銀行對於此事，極爲重視。並函請財部切實査禁，該行對於各商業行莊匯款申請，已嚴加考核，凡有正當用途者，方予核准。</p>
<h3>紡管昨開例會　討論要案兩起　生產成本問題尙待洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會第卅二次例會，於昨日下午三時，假市府舉行。到吳兼主委，李副主委，委員吳珠經·王啓宇·榮鴻元·唐星海·郭棣活·楊錫仁，及紡管會業務處處長劉文騰等，討論迄五時許散會。</p>
<p>重要議案二起：（一）六區棉紡公會提出廿支標準紗成本計算方式兩種：（甲）按原棉每担一百八十萬元計算，利潤及統稅除外，每件紗需成本八百六十萬元。（乙）按原棉每祖一百八十萬元，及聯總棉花每担七十五萬元，各半平均扯算，利潤及統稅除外，每件紗需成本六百六十萬元。當經討論一過，咸認爲吳兼主委在上次全國物價委會議定紗價時，曾提議廿支紗每件五百五十萬元，當局尙嫌過高，故所提兩項成本價格，恐難期當局批准。惟目前政府所定議價四百六十萬元，實感不敷成本。議決由吳兼主委於本週全國物價委會時，提出請求調整。</p>
<p>（二）民營各紗廠提請政府對各廠去年十二月底存棉所產之棉紗，勿再收購，理由有二：（甲）去年杪棉花雖廉，惟是時法幣　値頗高，不能與現時相提並論。（乙）按目前四百六十萬元之收購價，實不敷各紗廠之再生產成本。討論經過，議決待吳兼主委轉向當局洽商後決定。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕該會辦理紗布輸往華北及河北地區各口岸由請登記事宜，迄目前為止，前往領表之廠商，已在五百家以上。該會辦理本市廠商申請登記事宜，已定於本月十二日截止云。</p>
<h3>列舉四項理由請求提高價格</h3>
<p>中國紡織建設公司以棉紗配價與黑市價格相差太甚，公司虧蝕太鉅，特於日前列舉四大理由，請求經濟部提高配紗價格，其所列理由如次：</p>
<p>（一）過去銷售紗布，其牌便咸視手頭存貨及市塲需要情形審度核定，較市價低百分之三至百分之十不等。對於紗布價格旣無黑市，並能發生牽制作用，自　價實行，棉紗價格硬性規定後，遵守政令，未敢踰越，乃近來各地紗價暴漲，以滬市而諭，市價較牌價高出約達二分之一，相　太甚，公司每次開紗約近三千件，以激　價與市價差額之總數，竟達六七十億元之鉅。此項抑價拋售，平民實際未嘗獲益，而徒爲商人中飽，國庫蒙受重大損失，轉致黑市猖狂，未能收平抑之效。（二）商人愈獲利，游資愈充斥，物價愈暴騰，囤積居奇之力量亦愈厚。（三）廠商出產棉紗，應照議價出售，而事實上多於黑市出售，照譏價列賬，政府稅收無形中大减低。（四）目前棉花價格，以二十支原料言，每担已達百二十萬元，公司牌售紗價所得，尙不敷原棉成本。其他公繳稅捐等等費用，均無從出，公司每一次牌售棉紗，姑以差額六十億元計，牌售棉布姑以差額二十億元計，每月共計差額一千三百餘億元，全年總計將約達一萬五千餘億元。此僅就上海一地而言，　靑及東北各地尙不在內。本年度國家總預算核定本公司應繳盈餘四千億元，深恐不僅無分文盈餘可以繳庫，勢將請求國庫貼補。</p>
<p>經濟部據報後，已電飭紡織事業管理委員會從速按聯總棉花供應價格議定紗價，並電復該公司在棉紗新議價未決定以前，應嚴遵國家政令，不得追　黑市外。特於日前電滬市府嚴格制止總　黑市，以資穩定市塲，市府已分令社會，警察兩局遵照。</p>
<h3>人絲喊價續挫</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市開盤即疲，一二〇號高山有光先喊一千七百二十萬元，中間最小喊過七百萬元，後因有實銷戶來吸收，乃又回升在七百三四十萬元之間盤旋，迄午以三十萬元收盤，有四五箱成交。下午喊價未動，結果比上日跌落七十萬元。七十五號半光市上奇缺，故昨市喊價仍未變更，</p>
<p>廠經因銀緊影響，同行互做極鮮，即綢廠帮亦罕採辦，昨市喊價各檔俱比上日小去二三十萬元不等。</p>
<p>綢貨亦隨原料而吿降，被面跌去三十萬元，且乏做開。大　格子璧　因上日塲內發生糾紛，昨日起塲內暫行停止交易，塲外成交三萬元至另五百元，比上日短一千五百元。其餘喊價，因交易寂寥，大致無甚變動。</p>
<h3>台糖恢復　十四期配售</h3>
<p>停止已久之合糖配售，昨起台灣糖業公司已照社會局規定，恢復第十四期配售。其配價係按新調整價格計算，特號砂白每市担卅五萬元，一號綿白每市担卅三萬元，申請對象以糖商爲主體。聞此次申請者約計十七萬包，該公司認爲與過去事實不符，爲防止囤積起見，特預先規定核配辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）配售標準根據各客戶本年第一期至十三期准購總數量，加上本期（十四期）申請數量，配售十四分之一。</p>
<p>（二）本期申請最高額，每種以五百包爲限，特砂與一綿各半，如有超過者亦以五百包論。</p>
<p>（三）最低配額爲特號砂白十五包，實配單位計三四七戶，其中糖行佔二五九戶，餘屬餅乾糖果罐頭汽水各業及合作社等，實配數爲三萬六千包。特砂一綿各半，特砂（麻包）計一八〇斤，綿白（草包）一二零斤。茲悉核准各戶昨已領取購單，今日的中國銀行付款，下週一領取棧單後，翌日出貨。</p>
<h3>潘議長勸上海市民　踴躍認購美金債劵</h3>
<p>上海市參議會潘議長公展，爲喚起市民踴躍認購美金債券起見，特於八日午後六時在新滬電台廣播。大意略謂：當前的經濟問題，必須標本兼治。大家鎭靜，不競購，不囤積，這是治標的辦法。至於治本，則不外開源節流，個人如是，國家亦復如是。目前政府當局正在亟力設法，使財政收支平衡；發行美金債劵也是其辦法之一。如果全上海市民徘各盡一分力量，成績必大有可觀。潘氏又謂本人是債券基金監理會委員之一，該會全體委員決以全副精神，維護債信，決不使購者稍有失望。最後潘氏指出購買美金債劵，就是擁護政府財政政策的表示，足以防止通貨膨脹。今後紙幣不再增發，物價自然安定，經濟恐慌的現象亦自然消滅云云。</p>
<p>募銷會舉辦大中學徵文</p>
<p>美金債劵募銷委會爲喚起全滬市民踴躍認購債券起見，特舉辦本市各大中學生徵文運動，大學組織爲「發行美金俊券與國計民生之關係」，中學組題爲「爲什麼我們要購買美金債劵」。徵文至六月十五日截止，七月一日發表每組錄取七名，獎金自一百萬元至廿萬元不等。</p>

<p>萬里河山染血痕，經年猶未净胡　；艱難皇祖開天職，勞瘁元公破斧身。爭獨立，與生存，成功讓爾我成仁；爲　百萬佳兒女，祖國何由報汝恩！</p>

<h3>于右任先生造像</h3>
<h3>臨校準草書千字文自序</h3>
<p>— 于右任</p>
<p>民國二十一年，余創設標準草書社於上海，廣求列代草聖之遣蹟，及漢晉簡策專石，從事於草書之整理。其致力之由，與終極之希望，在使兩千餘抽以來之國民文化工具，由繁而簡，由難而易，由苦而樂，由紛歧而趨統一，由處玄而歸實用。故其選字也，以易識，易寫，美麗，準確爲主，其取材也，兼求之於章今狂三派之作者，使其各盡所長，有平均發展之機會。以是之故此時所告慰於天下者，則在取材選字之中，曾發現祖宗累代理廠，爲新時代邁進之利器，俾撥亂反下，有緒可尋。所遺憾者，時代遠，則材料不充，　刻且多失真，時代近，則實用旣窒窄，流傳亦少名作，欲爲系統條例，甚蜚易事！昔許叔重作說文，終其身，文字未定，冲始以書上安帝，具心急如焚整齊文字之難。余之治此，僅十年賴諸同人之助，有初步之成功，亦云倖矣！</p>
<p>二十五年，曾由漢文正楷書局，印五百本，以急　出書，例解皆不完備。二十六年二次修正本在，甫欲付印，而抗戰建並進之際，事有應爲，理當急赴，况文字爲人類文化之結晶，人羣生命之連系，亦即世界文明之總的動力，又百工，察萬品，其關係於國家民族之生存生活者至爲切要，新國家之建設，尤利賴於進步之文字，以爲之推動而速其成功。歐美各強國，科學進步，文字亦簡，印刷用楷，書寫用章，習之者，皆知其便。吾國文字書寫困難，欲持比以自立於競爭劇烈之世界，其結果則不遣必變，不變則是全部落後，有必然者。就時間論，大禹惜寸陰，陶侃惜分陰，「時乎，時乎，」其爲聖哲之所寶貴也如此！乃知吾人今日之所當惜而尤當爭者，以分寸計之，已爲失算！故此後國家民族憶萬世之基，皆應由一點一畫一忽一秒計起；人與人，國與國之強弱成敗，即決於其獲得時間之長短多寡。文字改良，雖爲節省時間之一事，然以其使用之廣，總吾全民族將來無窮之日月計之，覺細故哉！余等數年以來，不敢稍懈，兩商　授，重爲　訂，二十七年交中華　局印三百本，二古九年印五百本，擬審定後即行發售，中間僅以少數分率友人，餘皆滯留香港，未及運回，遂使關心文化事業而知余盡瘁於此者，遲望不已，深爲不安。</p>
<p>近年國家建設皆突飛猛進，而吾輩負荷之文字改進工作，則無法趕上，憾也何如。今春社中同人，稍稍來集，乃重爲選校一過。書分上下兩卷，上卷爲草聖千文，聖千云者，字皆選之古歷代草聖，慎爲　形，並疏出處；下卷爲標準草書釋例，釋例云者，歸納古今草書之變化，而釋之以例，標準符號，分製表志「聖千」，「釋例」，互爲注證前者備草法使轉之秒，後者明書史不傳之秘。</p>
<p>餘此次整理，深恐理得而用違，或以古人機緣偶成之字，強後人以難習。選校時，常常以筆畫紙，騐其合否劉同志延濤積前後所書，選鈎成冊，且請與標準草書併印，以爲習聖千者之　考，而增長學書者之與趣！用力景勤，其匡益於余者亦最多。甚矣哉，同人之思以宣揚草書，解放文字，而無所不用其極也。昔某名家臨前賢草書，終日不成　歡曰：「真亦在前，令人氣　！」余今書此，亦有同感！所幸標準草書付印即成，符號組織與條例變化之理，一一列表說明，今學者必能鼓舞奮與，更有驚人之發明也，三十一年七月于右任序於山洞。</p>
<p>祝于任先生壽辰　朱敬炘</p>
<p>今天是檢查院院長于左路任先生六句晋九的壽辰，記得卅四年于氏在重慶度六十七歲誕辰時，曾作了兩首詩，（已見本刋）可以作爲他的目傅。先生時，已是清室昏庸，朝政腐敗，外患交迫的時候，所以幼時即懷着耕牧山河的大志。在這六十九年中，由革命，而北伐，而抗戰，屢與強暴的惡勢力相搏鬥，寫出中華民族史上最光榮的一頁，先生正可以代表中華民族的爆竹工人，向人類歌呼着。</p>
<p>先生原籍陜西涇陽人，寄居三原，故生於三原之新莊，他那飄飄然的銀髯，原是關西漢子的風度。三歲喪母，依伯母房太夫人撫育長成。七歲入熟，十一歲至三原從毛班香先生學。十四歲入縣學，二十歲補　，二十五歲中舉。先生對於清延腐敗，極爲不滿，曾印行半哭半笑樓詩，識諷時政，三原縣令指爲革命黨，告諸陜西巡撫，巡撫乃奏請革去舉人，嚴行緝捕。時先生正在汴梁應禮部試，鄉人李雨田先生遣人密告，先生即間關南下，至上海，入震旦大學，受業於馬相伯先生之門。</p>
<p>清光緒卅一年，震旦大學因外籍教員干涉而解散，先生奉馬先生之命，在吳淞別組復旦公學。這時留日學生，因取締風潮，紛紛返國，又創中國公學於砲台灣，先生也列爲發起人，兼主國文講席。旋與兩校同人，發起神州日報。議定後，先生與邵力子先生東渡募股，謁　總理於東京，即於此時加入同盟會。故神州日報出版，宣揚革命，極爲智識階級所歡迎。未一年，神州日報厄於火，先生辭去，改編與論日報。</p>
<p>當初革命黨人，紛紛創辦報紙，提倡民族主義，前仆後繼，不遺是新聞史上爱燦爛的時代。其時倡導革命的報紙抵，有堅天三民和横三民的名稱，所謂堅三民者，即民呼，民吁，民立三報，均爲于氏所創辨神州日報被火後，先生雖已脱離，但鼓吹革命之念，始終榮繞於腦海中。主編與論日報不久，即他創辦长呼報，在出版預告中，有爲民請命語，頗爲清廷所注意。出版後，主張激烈，更爲清吏所忌，假甘肅賬款事，陷先生於獄，後獄雖解，而民呼終不復刋。旋創辦民吁報，未一年，又爲上海道蔡乃煌籍故誣害，翼於獄，仍以信刋報紙爲出獄條件，先生遂東渡。翌年又返滬，再創辨民了報，時清廷防範革命益嚴重，而編輯上反較前進步。至武昌起義前夕，民立報成爲革命军之總機關，每日戰事消息，均由民立報宣佈，人人皆以先睹爲快，印機盡夜不停，然尙有人向隅者。</p>
<p>民國七年，關中戰敵彌苦，先生應靖國軍諸将少請，北上主持陕西靖國軍事。雖衆寡懸殊，餉糧不繼，但仍能舆强敵周旋数年，是皆得力於先生之精诚相感，故均效死不屈。尤其是靖國軍區中，對於主義之宣揚，教育之實施，文化事定之策進，能配合軍事而推進之，使西北人士，得受時代精神之陶冶，爲北方革命势力之先導。直至民國十一年，兵勢日　，先生乃離軍東下，經武漢而至上海，靖國軍事始告結束。</p>
<p>民國十五年，劉鎮華率兵人陜，團長安城。先生欲援陜而路不通，乃取道蘇俄，越蒙古南下，抵達陕境，時痛快祥将軍亦自蘇俄歸團。万共同成立國民軍聯軍，誓師於五原。先生則至三原、合團民军二三兩军，解長安之團，時長安城破團已八九月，軍民　斃達數萬人。先生以總司令兼行省府職權，撫辑軍民，籌盡出兵，未及兩月，典北伐之師想會鄭州。</p>
<p>當先生初次至東京謁總理時，總理即任先生爲長江大都督。鼎革後，總理於南京就第一任大總統職，任先生爲交通部長。民國十七年，國民政府奠都南京，先生任黨政軍常務委員，翌年，任審計院長。民國二十年，先生出任爲檢查院長，迄今已十六年矣。清直之名，人所公認。</p>
<p>于氏的法書，和池的銀髯，同是聞名全國。其字龍蛇飛舞，粗看時似極率易，而細察之則無一筆不入神，此功力之深有以致之。先生初宗北魏，中年習行書，比年来專致力章草。字不拘泥於一家，凡古今名迹，一字一筆，已臻化境者，輒岣描之。甞以總理親署之孫文二字，及先烈黄　所書之與字，屢鉤描，不但遵勁有力，抑且神妙絕倫。先生之岀，旣達神奇妙境，但並不惜墨如金，凡丈書者，不論同袍，好友，下至販夭走卒，即素昧平生，無不欣然應命。是故于氏所書之市招、到處可見。若至兰原，則所有機關。學校，寺廟，商店之勝額招牌，即乎全是于或一人之手筆。</p>
<p>先生復以我國字體反腐，書寫廢時，而簡體字，又有背文字學之原則。於是提倡草書，認爲旣便書寫，又頗美觀，復符合古人造字之旨。民國廿一年，創標準草書社於上海，搜羅草書碑帖，從事整理，由紛歧而趨統一，由靈玄而歸實用。誠「新時代之利器」也。</p>
<p>先生之勳業文章，無須　述。今雖達六十九歲之高齡，而精神仍極爲逢勃，使青年人見之，感情更爲激越，老年人見之，重溫少日心情，病者弱者見之，鼓舞其奮鬥勇氣。其精神，實较一般入爲壮健也。</p>
<p>敬祝先生如松柏之永　！</p>
<p>敬祝國華民族萬壽無疆洪？</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Review Meeting Decides to Adjust Salaries of Military and Civil Servants; Economic Commission to Discuss Price Issues Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] The principles for adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants were decided at the Executive Yuan's political review meeting held at 10:00 AM on the 9th. The measures were also passed, but are still awaiting the Executive Yuan's Accounting Office to study and calculate the total budget after the adjustment. The Ministry of Finance will then assess the actual situation and pass it at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 13th. Therefore, the amount decided in this measure has not been disclosed by any party. After the political review meeting adjourned, only the Director of the Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, made the following public announcement: "Regarding the salaries and wages of civil and military public school teachers and workers, the Executive Yuan's review meeting proposed today to adjust them with reference to the actual situation, starting this month, and a decision will be made at the political affairs meeting next Tuesday."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] The National Economic Commission's Price Committee is scheduled to discuss current price issues at 9:00 AM on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] It is rumored that the authorities, in order to absorb idle funds, are considering having the national bank launch short-term savings deposits with a term of one year or six months and attractive interest rates.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] It is reported that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will soon establish an Overseas Chinese Economic Bureau to encourage and assist overseas Chinese to invest in the country.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] Political Committee Member Jiang Yuntian left for Shanghai by train on the night of the 9th. The economic policy reforms advocated by Jiang have not yet been raised at the political review meeting (i.e., the special meeting referred to by Reuters) on the 9th. Jiang told reporters today that he will submit them after further study with several individuals. At the same time, Jiang used the example of taking a car to emphasize that after the abolition of foreign exchange controls, if the exchange rate is too high, cars should not be imported, and we can all walk more often.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Controls Seem Necessary; Currency Reform Is Not Yet Timely</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] An economic expert who participated in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference told reporters on the 9th that in the current situation, abolishing foreign exchange rates may cause various inconveniences and may not necessarily benefit the current economic situation. He solemnly pointed out that national foreign exchange controls are a last resort, especially in foreign trade, which is necessary; after the war, the losses were heavy, exports were difficult, and import needs increased. To seek a stable international balance of payments, one must start with foreign exchange controls. If it is allowed to proceed unchecked, not only will gold resources be lost, but funds will also flee abroad. The international balance of payments will inevitably form a reverse flow.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] Various parties are paying close attention to the issue of currency reform. When a reporter visited an authoritative economist on the 9th, he said: "Currency reform is extremely necessary, but it is not yet the time to carry out currency reform rashly at present." He pointed out that to seek currency reform, one must first have various objective conditions so that the value of the new currency can be maintained after the currency reform. It is said that before reforming the currency system, countries undergo a long period of consolidation, first seeking currency stability. Taking France as an example, the currency value has been stable since 1926, but currency reform did not begin until 1928. The situation in the United Kingdom is also the same. The country's restoration of the gold standard was also implemented after a considerable period of currency stability. When the reporter asked whether China could adopt Germany's method of using foreign loans to consolidate the currency system, he believed that the situations in the two countries could not be compared. The main difficulty Germany encountered at that time was external pressure. After a large loan was provided by a foreign country, the currency system problem could be solved. The difficulties China currently faces are that internal difficulties are greater than external pressure. Since the situations are different, the handling methods must also be different.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council; President Zhang Attends to Answer Questions; National Unity Is the Only Guarantee of Life</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, South 9th] The 22nd meeting of the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council was held at 9:00 AM on the 9th, chaired by Jiang Yong. After announcing the opening of the meeting, President Zhang was invited to attend and report. After Zhang's report, Secretary Shao asked the resident committee members to discuss various preparatory matters related to the opening of the third session of the fourth National Assembly, and nominated Peng Ge Chen, Fan Yu Sui, Wang Pu Han, Yin Shu Xian, and Wu Chun Wu to be responsible for reviewing the "Review Report on the Implementation of Resolutions of the Second Session of the Fourth National Assembly" and the "Work Report of the Resident Committee." These two reports will be submitted to the third National Assembly. The third session of the fourth National Assembly of the Political Consultative Council is scheduled to be held on the 20th of this month and is tentatively scheduled to close on June 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] The outline of the work report drafted by the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council is as follows: (1) Review the national budget, (2) Form a joint reception and investigation team, (3) Call for a cessation of military conflicts, (4) Oppose international interference, (5) Increase the powers of the Political Consultative Council, (6) Prepare for the President's birthday celebration, (7) Thoroughly investigate the gold rush, (8) Investigate the plane crash, (9) Improve the grain administration mechanism, (10) Revoke the proposed agreement to allow foreign ships to navigate our inland waterways. This report is intended to be reported at the fourth National Assembly. It is not yet finalized and will be decided after review by the review team.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] After Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan reported to the participating councilors on the 9th, Councilor Chuan Sinian first raised a question, strongly advocating severe punishment for illegal officials as a warning to others. He emphasized, "Why did the government lend money to the Shenxin Cotton Mill and buy cotton from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for 700,000 yuan per piece, but sell it for 1.5 million yuan?" Regarding the grain issue, Fu also believed that the handling in Shanghai was not satisfactory, and the allocation was not universally achieved, but was instead manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. The government should take tough and quick measures to appease the people. Subsequently, Yin Shuxian also expressed opinions on the China Grain Company's handling of people's food, believing it was inappropriate and affecting current prices. He also heard that each section chief of the company had a car and advocated that the government should conduct a thorough investigation. Zhang made a brief reply to the inquiry.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing 9th] Premier Zhang Qun reported to the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council that the people's lives can only be properly guaranteed when the country is unified. He supports the rationing of daily necessities and the government's continued subsidies to public utilities to prevent price increases and avoid adverse effects on the people's living standards. The current monthly salary of civil servants reaches 14 billion yuan, and the monthly salary of officers and soldiers is about 300 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Talk of Restoring Peace Talks</h3>
<p>Relevant Persons Claim It Is Not True</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] A newspaper in Beijing reported that Shao Lizi agreed with the Shanghai Da Mei Evening News's evaluation of national affairs, advocating the restoration of peace talks, and emphasizing that some government officials are planning to restore peace talks. However, some relevant persons stated on the 9th that this is absolutely untrue. In addition, Wu Dingchang, Secretary General of the Civil Service, visited Shao Lizi at 11:30 AM on the 9th for a brief conversation. Wu said it was a private visit.</p>

The Chinese and American governments signed an agreement on the sale of surplus materials last August, stipulating that all materials should be cleared within 22 months. Most of the surplus materials in China have now been transferred, but a large amount of materials are still waiting to be transported on Okinawa and other islands in the Pacific.

<h3>The Issue of Our Surplus Salt Exported to Japan; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance Discusses the Actual Situation; If There Is No Surplus for Self-Use, Exports to Japan Will Stop</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] In recent years, the industrial circles and all sectors of society in our country have attached great importance to the issue of exporting surplus salt to Japan. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently issued the following statement on this matter:</p>
<p>(1) Our country's salt production situation: Our country produces a lot of salt, and production has always exceeded sales. This year, the output of salt fields in various regions of the country can reach 3 million tons. In addition to supplying about 2.3 million tons for national food needs and industrial and fishery salt, there is a surplus of about 800,000 tons.</p>
<p>(2) All exports to Japan are surplus salt. The best use for surplus salt is for domestic industrial salt. The government strongly promotes industrial salt and currently provides it free of charge. However, the actual amount of industrial salt released nationwide last year was only over 60,000 tons, which is difficult to accommodate the surplus salt. Moreover, the surplus salt is produced by salt farmers and a way out must be found to maintain the livelihood of salt producers. Therefore, since last year, surplus salt has been exported to Japan. This year, the maximum amount of surplus salt to be exported to Japan is set at 500,000 tons for the whole year, and 150,000 tons are planned to be exported to Japan in the first half of the year. Of the 800,000 tons of surplus salt, not all is exported, and a portion is stored for domestic use.</p>
<p>(3) The economic benefits of Japanese salt at present: using useless surplus salt to exchange for urgently needed materials at present, such as transportation timber, mineral timber, and silk, etc., can not only maintain the livelihood of salt farmers, but also save huge amounts of foreign exchange and enrich the economy of the belly society. The benefits are very great.</p>
<p>(4) The recovery of Japanese industry has nothing to do with our country's export of surplus salt to Japan. Japan is currently under the control of the Allied forces. Whether its industry should be restored and to what extent it should be restored is entirely up to the Allied forces, which has nothing to do with our country's export of surplus salt to Japan. Japan has now ordered 400,000 tons of African Red Sea salt from the United Kingdom, which the United Kingdom will ship to Japan with its own ships at a price of US$15.7 per ton. This proves that even if our country does not export surplus salt to Japan, Japan can still purchase salt from other sources to revive its industry, and our country will only lose international trade opportunities and lose many economic benefits, which is a pity. Therefore, we should seize the opportunity to export surplus salt to Japan in exchange for goods.</p>
<p>(5) If our country's industry is developed, salt exports to Japan can be stopped. As mentioned above, all salt exports to Japan are surplus. If our country's salt industry develops and the demand for industrial salt increases, we will give priority to supplying domestic use as much as possible. If all the salt produced nationwide can be sold domestically and there is no surplus, salt exports to Japan can be stopped at any time.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The case of the traitor Ding Mocun was previously sentenced to death by the Beijing High Court on February 8th of this year. Leidi did not accept the appeal. After reviewing the most business court; "The original judgment was overturned, Ding Mocun colluded with enemy countries to plot resistance against his own country, sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property confiscated except for necessary living expenses for family members" The main reasons are as follows: "The defendant was originally a member of the Chinese Kuomintang and once held important positions in the Central Military Commission. At a time when the War of Resistance was extremely tense and the country's safety was at stake, he merely removed his position as director of the Third Division of the Military Statistics Bureau, in anger, he forgot the big picture for trivial reasons, and small grievances overrode great principles, not hesitating to betray the party and join the enemy's puppet regime, serving in important positions in the puppet regime and acting in opposition to our side. Moreover, he attended the Puppet Central Political Committee to discuss the Puppet side's national policy and attempted to shake our country's foundation, presided over the Puppet Special Task Force Headquarters to harm our judicial talents and patriotic warriors, thereby weakening our resistance forces. Compile Zhejiang Provincial Property Survey, supplying the enemy, to exploit our people's wealth. Publishing the fallacies of the Greater East Asia War to promote enemy rhetoric and confuse enemy hearing. Organized shock troops to contain the Allied forces and try to prolong the time when the enemy collapsed. At the time when he and Wangni and others colluded, his position was high and his power was obvious, and he arbitrarily exercised his power, intending to cut off our Chinese nation and plunge it into eternal doom and then be happy. And when he saw different thoughts and transferred his energy away from his job, relying on the already formed situation of betrayal and rebellion, he helped to subvert our government. His crimes were not different from the great traitors and giants who first rebelled. If he is not placed in the canine position, it is not enough to justify the state and extend the national law. The original judgment was based on the fact that the defendant's crimes were extremely heinous and could not be forgiven. According to Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, he was sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and announced the confiscation of property in accordance with the law to conform to the law and be corrected."</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Conscription Problem in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Written by Fang Qiu</p>
<p>Shanghai is about to implement conscription, which is still a pioneering effort in Shanghai. As a result, the conscription process has been prepared many times and delayed many times, causing anxiety among the people and social unrest. The municipal authorities and military service agencies also lack publicity and explanation of government orders. Originally, it was an ordinary administration, but it was misunderstood by a few people as harming the people, which is an unfortunate event for the country's military service administration. The household survey of eligible young men began at the beginning of this month. According to the slight conscription process, after the household survey, there will be a physical examination, lottery, and conscription. The completion of the entire conscription process is cumbersome and time-consuming and cannot be delayed any longer. If delayed, it may reduce the efficiency of military service administration; it may also cause confusion due to incomplete procedures and the discovery of errors, which will only increase social strife and public criticism. Therefore, we hope that Shanghai's first conscription should be legal and reasonable, completed on time and in the required numbers, and strive for its ideal, striving to be a demonstration for the national military service!</p>
<p>Military service is an important policy of the state, the foundation of building an army, and the potential strength of the country. An independent country should have its national defense, and should have its army and its military service. The constitution of any country stipulates that the people have the obligation to perform military service. Our country's constitution also has special articles. The Military Service Law is a substantial law that promotes military service and stipulates the obligation of the people to perform military service. During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the frontline urgently needed more soldiers, and the Military Service Law provided a constant stream of soldiers. The Military Service Law brought us victory and protected our nation's survival and national security. The merits of the Military Service Law will last forever and will never decay. The Military Service Law was partially amended in light of the war experience and national defense goals. The revised Military Service Law was promulgated and implemented by the National Government on October 10th last year. At the same time, the National Government issued a proclamation to the people: "Since October 10th of the thirty-fifth year, the revised military service regulations will continue to be implemented. All our citizens must know that military service is the natural duty of everyone, and must encourage each other to respond enthusiastically so that the foundation of army building can be laid and national defense forces can be enriched." To assist in the implementation of the Military Service Law, the National Government promulgated and implemented the "Implementing Regulations of the Military Service Law" on February 19th of this year. From the perspective of the military service legal system, the military service legal system is largely complete. Local governments at all levels and military service agencies at all levels should proceed in an orderly manner, implement conscription according to law and procedures, train citizens, promote martial virtue, and enrich their patriotic feelings to enhance the survival potential of an independent country.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation and implementation of the Military Service Law, all localities in the country, except for the pacification zones and the Yellow River disaster areas, have implemented conscription in accordance with the law. Only Shanghai has been delayed. In terms of responsibilities, the Shanghai Municipal Government has a Department of Civil Affairs, and the Department of Civil Affairs has a Military Affairs Section dedicated to this matter; the Ministry of National Defense has also established a Division and Regiment Garrison Command in Shanghai, all of which are military service administrative agencies. In terms of expenses, the military service expenses in the Shanghai Municipal Budget for this year are 184,881,140 yuan, in addition to the defense affairs expenditure of the Division and Regiment Garrison Command. In terms of population, the population of Shanghai is more than 4 million. According to the survey conducted by the Department of Civil Affairs in October last year: there are 991,3178 men aged 18 to 20; there are 231,538 men aged 20 to 25; there are 113,550 men aged 25 to 30; there are 194,996 men aged 30 to 35; there are 179,045 men aged 35 to 40; and there are 156,791 men aged 40 to 45. Logically speaking, the conditions for implementing military service in Shanghai are very sufficient, and there are many enthusiastic and righteous people in Shanghai. If conscription is implemented, raising preferential expenses and collecting comfort supplies is also better than in other places. With these subjective and objective conditions, conscription in Shanghai should be promoted smoothly, handled in accordance with the law, and will surely be successful!</p>
<p>Because Shanghai's conscription has been delayed for a long time, people in neighboring provinces and counties believe that Shanghai has special circumstances and can evade military service. As a result, Shanghai's population has increased sharply in the past six months, the household registration has become chaotic, and those who evade military service are trying to obtain positions. Due to the increase in population, the lack of housing, the expansion of consumption, and the soaring prices of food and goods, the stability and order of society have been affected, affecting the control of the public security organs. If this phenomenon continues to develop, it will not be the happiness of the Shanghai society, but a hidden danger in the Shanghai society. Today's Shanghai, solving the unemployment problem and the population problem is one thing, and solving the entire society is another, and conscription must be promoted as soon as possible, and those who evade military service and concentrate in cities must be punished. This can not only assist in solving social problems, but also eliminate social chaos and anxiety. In short, in today's Shanghai, social problems and military service problems have become linked, so solving the military service problem is solving the social problem. This point, I hope the administrative authorities and social figures, must recognize, must pay attention to.</p>
<p>Now the household survey of eligible young men is underway, which is only the beginning of the military service process. The survey is passive, and the physical examination and lottery conscription involve legal departments and the determination of people's identity. The handling must be cautious, and the review must be in accordance with the law. Therefore, Article 33 of the Military Service Implementing Regulations stipulates that the organized Military Service Association should also be advocated by social dignitaries, from assisting military farmers to supervising military service, whether it is inspection and lottery, or review of exemption from military service, all must be fair, just, reasonable, and lawful. Shanghai is an area where Chinese and foreign people are concentrated. Everyone is paying attention to the handling of conscription. It is hoped that the evil practices of handling military service in the interior and the malpractices of promoting military service in remote areas will not occur in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In short, Shanghai has superior conditions for handling military service. The administrative authorities should have the responsible courage and determination to handle Shanghai's military service well, set an example for the country, and change the national atmosphere, so as to achieve the effect of moving the wind and bending the grass. The time is now. May the Shanghai Municipal Authorities and social figures work hard to achieve it!</p>
<h3>Correspondences from Various Locations</h3>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Within the town and suburbs of this county, a rice looting incident occurred. After receiving the report, the county government, in order to maintain the rice supply for the common people, has designated nine locations including Huayang Bridge to set up public rice shops, with the rice price temporarily set at 1,600 yuan per city scale. Each household is allowed to purchase one dou of rice per day based on their household registration certificate, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Although the grain price in this county has slightly stabilized on the 9th, white rice is still hovering around 270,000 yuan, and the people's food situation remains severe. In addition to ordering all grain merchants to supply the market during the day, the authorities have also instructed grain merchants to maintain a reserve of 5,000 dan and will organize equal distribution.</p>
<p>Haining</p>
<p>Haining's Xiashi Town is a distribution center for the rice industry. Now, the local Rice Industry Association, in order to cope with the current food problem, will take necessary steps. Starting today, grain merchants from various places who come to Xiashi to purchase grain must hold documents clarifying their identities from their local grain association and the Farmland and Grain Office, otherwise they will be refused.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>The notorious bandit Zhu Qijia in this county first served as a commissioner for treacherous bandits, leading his gang to demolish houses and confiscate property, committing all kinds of evil deeds. The people hated him to the core. Some days ago, the bandit sneaked into the urban area and was spotted by elementary school student Zhang Bingyu, who reported him to the police. Those who heard about it cheered.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>The direct train service from Ningbo to Hangzhou will begin on the 16th of this month. It will stop at six stations including Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Cao'e, Yuyao, and Cixi. The full-line ticket price will be 20% higher than the regular price.</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>Amidst the severe rice scarcity, the County Price Stabilization Committee decided to organize the equitable distribution of 780 dan of unpolished rice within the next few days, allocating 60 dan to the urban area and 40 dan to each of the other towns.</p>
<p>Dongtai</p>
<p>The Dazhongji area of the 9th district of this county is a township that serves as a distribution center for cotton production in northern Jiangsu. Last month, it was captured by the communist army. All official documents and group records belonging to the towns of "Dazhong" and "Xinfeng" in the area were lost. In order to prevent theft and the generation of malpractices, the county government has specially renamed "Dazhong" as "Dazhongji" town, and "Xinfeng" town as "Dafeng" town.</p>

<h3>Acheson Advocates Effective Implementation of US Foreign Aid Plan Stabilization of the World is Truly Necessary Assisting the Revival of Germany and Japan Makes Them Work for the Interests of Europe and Asia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cleveland, Mississippi, 8th] Undersecretary of State Acheson said in a speech here today: There can be no political or economic stability in the world until all countries are able to support themselves, and no one can have lasting peace and prosperity. Therefore, the United States must continue to implement its large-scale foreign aid plan for several years. Many countries will need a very long time to recover without external assistance, and feelings of disappointment and frustration will inevitably arise. Under such circumstances, freedom, democracy, and independence cannot survive for long. Those who are hungry, cold, and desperate have no choice but to take risks, so war will never disappear until the people of the world have warm clothes and enough food and have some confidence in the future. This year, US imports are only half of exports, which raises some of the most important issues in international relations. How can other countries obtain US dollars to make up for this huge trade deficit, and what does this mean for the United States and US foreign policy if similar trade deficits are likely to continue next year or even the year after? The meaning is that we Americans must take measures to minimize the gap between the world's needs and its ability to pay, and there is no room for opportunism. This is just common sense. We today have an obligation to make up for the world's budget deficit, based on our own interests. Acheson continued: When the United States provides reconstruction assistance to foreign countries, it should give priority to free nations that are able to resist internal or external totalitarian pressures in order to maintain their independent democratic systems and human freedom. Furthermore, if foreign countries continue to purchase necessities for sustaining life and economic recovery from abroad in 1948 and 1949, the United States must continue to provide emergency financial assistance. The United States must actively promote the revival of Germany and Japan, which are the major factories of Europe and Asia. The revival of both continents depends on the revival of these two countries. The harmonious cooperation of all parts of the European economy is a basic condition for European revival, and this is a basic goal of US foreign policy. Acheson also said: The Geneva trade conference must succeed, not only because of the urgent supply and financial situation in the world today, but also because the United States is the world's largest producer and creditor country, so it must be able to obtain a large number of imports in the long run. Acheson concluded: The forces that can eliminate economic collapse are not just dollar loans, but also urgently needed wheat, coal, and steel.</p>

Eaton also read a telegram from US Representative to the UN agencies Austin, stating that the US aid to Greece and Turkey bill actually supports UN agencies in assisting Greece to restore order and assisting Turkey to maintain security.

<h3>Supreme Court Reverses Original Judgment, Orders Retrial of Wen LantIng Case, Claims Service in Puppet Government Was Under Secret Orders, Recognizes Appellant's Allegation of Improper Original Judgment as Justified</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The Wen Lanting case was previously judged by the Shanghai High Court on September 12th of last year. Wen appealed the original judgment. Now, the Supreme Court has issued a retrial, stating in the main text of the judgment: "The original judgment is revoked, and the case is returned to the Shanghai High Court for retrial." The main reasons are as follows: The original trial found the appellant guilty under Article 3 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, applying Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the same regulations, for participating in a puppet organization, relying on enemy puppet forces, and acting in a manner favorable to the enemy puppet regime and detrimental to our country. This cannot be said to be without grounds. However, the letter from the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party states: "In January of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Comrade Ji Xizong secretly reported that the working environment was becoming increasingly difficult and mentioned that Wen Lanting had lived in Shanghai for many years, was familiar with the local situation, and proposed contacting him for cover. Secret orders were issued approving him to go and negotiate, to provide cover, and to facilitate intelligence gathering. To strengthen the enemy's trust, it was agreed to join the puppet Municipal Chamber of Commerce and serve as a puppet supervisor. Furthermore, in February of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], when the enemy puppet organization Shangtonghui (Trade Control Association) implemented economic control, the Bureau, upon receiving the report, secretly ordered Comrade Ji to instruct Wen Lanting to serve as the supervisor of the Shangtonghui in order to disrupt their control conspiracy. Agreed to Wen Lanting serving as the director of the puppet Cotton Control Association. In June of the 32nd year, the puppet regime forced Wen Lanting to take over as chairman of the puppet Shangtonghui, which was also agreed to by telegram." The appellant also stated during the original trial, "The matters I did were under orders from the central government, and I was not a traitor." If the appellant's service in the puppet government was under orders to infiltrate and engage in counter-espionage work, then Article 21, Paragraph 2, First Section of the Criminal Law would apply. However, this fact was not mentioned at all by the appellant during the investigations by the Military Affairs Commission's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and the original trial, whether he assumed the task of subversion and intelligence gathering after participating in the puppet government. Moreover, regarding the fact that the Rice Industry Control Association supplied the Japanese invaders with military rice, the appellant confessed, "Approximately 'two million dan' were ordered annually by the puppet Executive Yuan." It is questionable whether the appellant, as chairman of the Shangtonghui, forwarded this order to the Rice Control Association for supply. The original trial did not transfer and interrogate Ji Xizong, nor did it retrieve relevant case files and conduct a detailed investigation. The ability to conduct investigations on its own authority in the trial was, in fact, incomplete. The appellant's grounds for requesting a retrial, criticizing the original judgment as improper, cannot be said to be without reason and should be recognized as grounds for a retrial. Based on the above conclusions, a judgment should be made in accordance with the proviso of Article 22, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations, as in the main text.</p>

(2) Forward to the Executive Yuan an order instructing the Ministry of Transportation to determine the nature of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway freight business offices and improve the handling of freight business. (3) Citizens suggest immediately banning or destroying comic books to prevent harm to children's minds; please refer to the Social Bureau.</p>
<h3>Council Speaker Issues Statement on Rice Rationing Problems</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Speaker Pan issued a statement to reporters yesterday, saying: In recent days, in order to understand the implementation of local self-government in various districts and the matters that should be promoted and reformed, the council has held a total of seven symposiums in various districts, inviting the chairmen of the district people's representative conferences and the heads and deputy heads of the districts. These symposiums concluded successfully yesterday. The attendees from various districts provided many opinions on the issue of people's food. In summary, they are as follows: (1) Since the Municipal Government adopted the method of purchasing subsidized rice with household registration certificates, each district has felt that the supply cannot meet the demand, which inevitably leads to repeated disputes. Therefore, they still hope that the authorities will broaden the source of supply and increase the quota for each district. (2) Regarding the new measures that the Municipal Government will take recently, it is said that it intends to prioritize the rationing of rice to workers, public school teachers, and the poor in the city. This intention is quite reasonable. Although it is still under study, all parties hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible. However, according to the opinions of various districts, it is felt that the definition of the so-called poor should have a clear scope to avoid abuses. Although most citizens in the suburbs are engaged in agriculture, the districts of Pudong, Dachang, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Longhua, except for a small portion that grows vegetables, mostly grow dry crops such as cotton and wheat and do not produce rice. Their rice supply still relies heavily on the urban area. Moreover, there is no shortage of poor people from other provinces in the suburbs. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can treat the suburbs and the urban area equally when dealing with the food problem. The above two points are both facts, and I am very sympathetic. In the face of extreme difficulties, the government's response to the food crisis, prioritizing the supply to the impoverished classes, is not unreasonable in principle. It only requires careful planning, competent personnel, and the joint cooperation of all citizens in the city for the effect to be promising. However, the fundamental solution is still for the authorities to step up efforts to broaden the city's rice supply, strictly crack down on those who obstruct transportation and hoard goods for speculation, so as to facilitate freight transportation, and for citizens to jointly maintain order so that society is stable and legitimate rice merchants have the possibility of operating their businesses. Otherwise, repeated disputes will only disturb the people and will not help to suppress rice prices at all.</p>
<h3>United Office Established for Subsidized Rice Sales in Putuo District</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Putuo District Rice Merchants Association held the inauguration meeting of the United Office for Subsidized Rice Sales at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Zhongshan Hall of the Putuo Road Police Branch. Chief Qi of the branch, the heads and deputy heads of the district, and 50 rice merchant representatives attended. It was resolved that, for the sake of specialized responsibility, five companies would be designated to sell the Social Bureau's subsidized rice. After the launch, they would go to the Social Bureau to sign a contract. Before the official rationing of subsidized rice, the district office would be responsible for investigating, publicizing, and reporting the three types of impoverished households in the district as the target for rationing. The location of the office is temporarily borrowed from the Wufufu Company on Changshou Road.</p>
<h3>Crowd Arrested for Rice Riot on Lude Garden Road, Venerable Monk Fenggong Houli Granted Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 7:00 AM yesterday, citizens went to the Tongxin Rice Store at No. 116 Luxiang Garden Road in the Nanshi district to buy rice. The store, fearing a riot, refused to open its doors. By around 11:00 AM, more and more people had gathered to buy rice, and someone shouted, "The rice store is hoarding rice and not selling it. We have no rice left at home. How are we supposed to solve lunch?" Then, the crowd rushed forward and opened the doors of the rice store, resulting in the looting of twenty shi of white rice and eight shi of brown rice. The police station, upon receiving the report, went to suppress the riot and arrested He Ayuan, Tang Shenggen, Zhou Zhifang, Guo Linshi, Ma Caiying, Wu Linbao, Kuang Jinsheng, Chen Jintu, Ji Zhenhua, Shao Huangtang, Jiang Jintu, Zhang Cairong, Shi Yuanfu, Wang Wensheng, and fourteen others. The police station sent them to the District Prosecutor's Office at 5:00 PM. The prosecutor opened the court, and all fourteen denied looting rice, some saying they were passing by, others saying they intended to buy household registration rice. The court ordered that all be temporarily released on bail pending further investigation.</p>
<p>Accountant of Lifeng Rice Store Detained</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The newly opened Lifeng Rice Store on Jumen Road in the Nanshi district received a number of rationed rice bags the day before yesterday. Nearby citizens went to buy rice, but the store claimed that it was too late to complete the registration procedures and that they would have to wait until tomorrow. By about 8:00 AM yesterday, sales began. At noon, Cao Juemin and Liu Xianhua went to buy rice, but were told that the rice was sold out, resulting in a conflict. The police were called, and the relief worker Ma Jingbo was taken to the police station for questioning. Later, the bureau sent investigators and discovered that the rationed rice did not match the household registration certificates, suggesting intentional embezzlement. He was temporarily detained at the Songshan Branch and will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation this morning.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Law School and Other Schools Gather at Municipal Government to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At 2:00 PM yesterday, six to seven hundred representatives from Shanghai Law School and other schools, led by Chu Fucheng, Dean of the Law School, gathered at the square of the Municipal Government to petition the Municipal Government regarding the May Fourth Memorial Day incident in which police clashed with students and students were beaten and injured. Mayor Wu sent representatives to persuade the students to return to school and resume classes and to resolve the matter through proper and legal channels. The students insisted that the mayor respond. Mayor Wu appeared at about 6:00 PM and explained the Municipal Government's handling of the case. The students raised questions, which the mayor answered separately. Until 8:30 PM in the evening, Mayor Wu, whose previously scheduled dinner with the Dutch ambassador was approaching, left first, and the student representatives also dispersed. It was reported that at that time, the venue was small, there were many students, and the order was very chaotic. Fortunately, the mayor and the police authorities handled the situation very carefully, so no incident was caused. However, the walls and ground of the Municipal Government were covered with slogans, and traffic on the nearby roads was also disrupted.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Employees Wait Quietly for Announcement of De-Freezing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] French Concession Water and Electricity employees stopped working yesterday to petition for the unconditional de-freezing of the cost-of-living index.

Upon hearing the news, the Social Bureau urgently summoned the responsible persons of the labor unions of Shanghai Power, Telephone, British Tramway, Gas, and Water and other major public utilities to a meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department, and Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, persuaded them to wait for the government to decide on a solution before expressing their attitude and not to act rashly.</p>
<p>It is reported that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, will do his utmost to fight for the de-freezing matter during this trip to Beijing. The General Labor Union has also dispatched Zhang Zhusan and Qiu Changjiang to Beijing to petition the day before yesterday.</p>

At about 8:00 AM, more than 2,400 employees arrived at the meeting, where they discussed the issue with great enthusiasm. The person in charge was unable to control the situation, so they decided to hold a demonstration march. At 8:30 AM, they departed from the union, three abreast, led by two national flags, with the procession stretching for several li. They passed through Lin Sen Road, Shan Kuang Road, Haig Road, Jing'an Temple Road, He De Road, Foch Road, Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Zhongzheng East Road, and Lin Sen Road, shouting slogans for the de-freezing of the cost-of-living index and posting slogans along the way.

At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, they returned to the union, dispersed to eat, and prepared the vehicles for departure at 4:00 PM. At 4:30 PM, all employees resumed work. The labor union and the management agreed that the wages for the work stoppage time yesterday would be paid as usual. The company's loss yesterday was estimated at more than 60 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Chen Yiyun Reports Damage and Attends Pan-Asian Conference at Tea Party</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Central Committee member Ms. Chen Yiyun returned to Beijing after attending the Pan-Asian Conference in India. This time, she came to Shanghai at the invitation of the Women's Movement Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Women's Association, and reported on her experience attending the conference at a tea party at No. 580 Nanjing West Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Qian Jianqiu, Tian Shujun, Zhu Su, Lu Lihua, Fu Xiaofeng, and about 30 other people attended.</p>
<p>Ms. Chen said that she did not dare to represent Chinese women on this trip to India. However, because she was the only woman representative attending the conference temporarily, she was de facto regarded as the representative of Chinese women. She continued: The Chinese delegation of eight people performed quite successfully at the Pan-Asian Conference. The reason for this was the close cooperation of the delegates. The biggest gain was that the representatives of India and other Asian countries expressed great goodwill and respect for China and were able to have a deeper understanding of China and greatly admired the spirit of the eight-year war of resistance. (The picture shows Central Committee member Chen standing up to report, taken by our newspaper)</p>

<h3>Commander Xuan Solemnly States That Conspiracies by Traitors Will Be Arrested and Dealt With According to Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Jingbei Commander Xuan Tiewu announced to reporters yesterday afternoon that he has paid great attention to the disturbances that have occurred recently. He has received very reliable reports that since the open members of the Communist Party have withdrawn, many secret operatives remain in Shanghai. They have infiltrated agencies, schools, and factories, attempting to create incidents at any time. The government's tolerance of their stay in Shanghai was intended to show leniency. If they abide by the law and do not incite disturbances or disrupt social order, they will not be interfered with. However, they are now unwilling to abide by the law. Xuan solemnly stated that he has made the necessary considerations on how to deal with these individuals.</p>
<p>Xuan also answered reporters' questions regarding various aspects of public security. He said: He is trying to effectively dissuade and curb the demonstrations and petitions that have occurred in recent days. He will consult with relevant parties in the coming days and will roughly decide that the Education Bureau will be responsible for handling matters related to students, the Social Bureau will be responsible for handling matters related to workers, and the public security agencies will provide assistance. If there are traitors instigating and conspiring to expand the disturbances, they will be arrested and dealt with according to law.</p>
<h3>News Media Holds Public Banquet to Celebrate President Yu's 69th Birthday</h3>
<p>Today is the 69th birthday of President Yu Youren, a veteran of the news media. The Shanghai Newspaper Association and the Journalists Association held a public banquet at the Fengzelou of the International Hotel last night at 7:00 PM to celebrate Yu's birthday. More than 50 heads of newspapers attended. Supervisors Yang Qianli and Inspector Yan Zhuang were also invited. During the banquet, Cheng Cangbi delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Shanghai news media, stating: President Yu is a senior member of the news media and a thought leader for the younger generation of journalists. He has made great contributions to the national culture. Today, the news media still relies on President Yu's continued leadership to strive towards a free and bright new China. Feng Youzhen then requested President Yu to give instructions on behalf of the banquet attendees. Qian stood up and spoke, saying that although he has only been actively engaged in the news industry for five or six years, he has been actively committed to the struggle for freedom of the press for 40 years. He continued, stating that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he wrote two papers, one advocating that the "Indochina Peninsula" in Southeast Asia be renamed the "Central and Southern Peninsula," which has been approved and adopted by the academic and news circles, and the other advocating that the "Sea of Japan" be renamed the "Pacific Ocean" in order to eliminate Japan's aggressive thinking and ensure permanent peace in Asia. Now that the War of Resistance Against Japan has been won and has long been realized, the peace treaty with Japan will soon be convened. I would like to reiterate this proposal here. If you agree, I hope you will promote it more to attract the attention of relevant countries and achieve unanimous adoption. Finally, he said that although he is old, he is confident that he is still healthy and will continue to work with everyone to achieve a free and bright new China as soon as possible. Yu was vigorous and his speech was loud and powerful. After the speech, the audience applauded warmly. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at around 8:00 PM. (The picture shows President Yu at the public banquet, taken by our newspaper)</p>
<h3>Fuxing Wheel Runs Aground and Slowly Sinks, All Crew Members Safe, Two-Thirds of Rice Expected to Be Salvaged</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Zhongxing Shipping Company's Fuxing Wheel, carrying 6,000 tons of rice (60,000 bags, purchased by the China Trust Bureau) from Bangkok, ran aground at 1:00 AM on the 7th of this month (i.e., late on the 6th) while sailing past the waters off Xiamen, near the site where the Qianhai Min Wheel and the Fubo warship collided with each other, mistaking the channel. The front hold was punctured, and seawater flooded in. The captain immediately sent a radio distress signal. The China Merchants Bureau's Peide Wheel, which was in the waters off Shantou, was the first to arrive at the scene, followed by two US warships. The Navy Department also telegraphed Taiwan to send warships to protect the area. Upon hearing the news, Hong Kong also dispatched three wheels for rescue. It is reported that one of them, the Yongsheng Wheel, has already salvaged more than 2,000 tons of rice and transported it to Hong Kong. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the vessel stating that the front hold had been flooded to 22 feet, the second hold had been flooded to more than 10 feet, and the stern was still floating, continuing to sink slowly. All crew members are safe. As for the rice, it is predicted that approximately two-thirds can be salvaged, while the rest and the hull of the ship will likely be sacrificed. It is also reported that the ship was previously insured for US$300,000, and the rice was also insured against accidents.</p>
<h3>Ma Shurong and Two Other Suspects Deny Colluding with the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Yesterday, the High Court heard three cases of suspected traitors. All were adjourned for further investigation. (1) Ma Shurong, 37 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 616, Hefei Road, is the owner of a funeral supplies store. He is accused of organizing the "Japan-China Timber Association" during the period in January of the 31st year of the Republic, when the enemy forces in Shanghai forcibly requisitioned timber. Ma joined the association as the manager of the Chinese merchant department, traveling between Shanghai and Jiangxi, transporting timber for the enemy. The Jiangxi High Prosecutor's Office transferred the case for investigation. Ma claimed that he went to Jiangxi in the 31st year and returned to Shanghai at the end of the year. From the 32nd year until the victory, he was engaged in the funeral supplies business and is currently a director of the Shanghai Timber Association. He denied joining the "Japan-China Timber Association," stating that the details can be verified with the timber association. (2) Chen Guangquan, 41 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 12, Meifang Lane, Changshu Road, was originally a Huaiyang opera performer playing male roles at the Shanghai Jiang Theater. After the victory, he introduced Miyara Yoshio, a Taiwanese, to the Zhejiang Coastal Defense Command for a position. Miyara disguised himself as a Chinese and spied on our military intelligence. After being discovered, he was arrested and executed by our army. Chen is suspected of colluding with the enemy, as reported by Zheng Tingxian. Yesterday, Chen stated that the informant, Zheng Tingxian, was unaware of the situation. Ye Gengsheng had a feud with him, stole Zheng's seal, and falsely accused him. He requested that Zheng Tingxian be summoned for questioning at the next hearing. (3) Li Jianci, the former chief of the General Affairs Section of the puppet Changshu County Government, is accused of serving as an interpreter for the enemy and leading enemy troops to burn houses in Xitan. His student, Gui Zhen, is accused of working as a secret agent in the Special Higher Police Section of the puppet Changshu Police Bureau.

(4) Zhao Ruheng, the nephew of Zhao Zhengping, the puppet Minister of Education, who served as the director of the Social Education Department of the puppet Ministry of Education. (5) Yang Zhengyu, who served as the director of the Education Bureau of the puppet Nanjing Municipality. Furthermore, the cases of Zeng Dingjun, Wang Qingtao, Shen Jing'an, and other suspected traitors, as well as the case of Lai Mengbao, suspected of colluding with the enemy, have all been prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<h3>Wang Weicai's Sentence Suspended, Cai Tingbang's Jurisdiction Incorrect</h3>
<p>Both Released from Prison Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Wang Weicai, a former puppet Baozhang (local security chief), was originally sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment by the High Court. Now, the Supreme Court has ruled for a suspended sentence. Also, Cai Tingbang, from Taiwan Province, was reported as a traitor due to a property dispute. After review by the High Court, it was deemed that the crime of treason could not be established and that the jurisdiction was incorrect. The case was ordered to be transferred to the local court for trial. Wang and Cai were both released from the High Court Detention Center yesterday.</p>
<h3>Son-in-Law Kills Wife for Immoral Conduct</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Wang Fuyuan from Dongtai, currently residing at No. 4, Lane 17, Hongyuan Road, Wusong Town, has a daughter named Lan Xiaozi, 23 years old. In the 32nd year of the Republic, he recruited Zhao as a live-in son-in-law through a matchmaker in his hometown. After the marriage, the family lived together, making a living by fishing. In July of last year, due to the unstable situation, they moved to Wusong. Before long, rumors about Lan Xiaozi's immoral behavior spread, making the husband angry but unable to speak out. Until recently, he could no longer tolerate it. One night, while his wife was asleep, he used an ax to strike her head three times. The woman screamed in pain. When her father woke up and rushed to check, the husband had already fled. The incident was reported to the local police station, and the woman was sent to the Fourth Municipal Hospital for treatment. It is reported that her injuries are severe.</p>
<h3>Secret Revealed in Court—Paying Someone to Take the Blame</h3>
<h3>Fraudster's Cunning Plan Fails</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Kong Xiangsen, Bian Aliu, Gao Jian Gui, and Wu Zhaoqing were previously detained for falsely using the name of the Shanghai Relief Association and forging membership forms to swindle unemployed workers out of membership fees. The prosecutor indicted them on charges of fraud. Yesterday, during the hearing at the District Court, Judge Xie Zhiying had just finished questioning Kong Xiangsen when the second defendant suddenly presented a large bundle of legal tender, telling the court, "Kong Xiangsen just gave me money, telling me to take the fall alone. I am truly innocent, and I dare not accept the money." Judge Xie was surprised and turned to question Kong. Kong denied giving the money, saying, "I am in prison, where would I get money?" Judge Xie ordered Kong to look for his family in the audience. Kong's father, Kong Bingkun, stood up, and Judge Xie immediately summoned him, advising him to tell the truth to avoid punishment. Kong Bingkun then confessed that he gave his son 220,000 legal tender when his son got off the prison van. Judge Xie ordered the bailiff to count the money, and the amount matched perfectly. The court then questioned Kong Xiangsen again. At this point, Kong could no longer deny it and silently acknowledged the truth. However, he said that the gift of money was voluntary. The court then stated that since the gift of money was voluntary, the legal tender should belong to Bian Aliu, and scolded Kong, saying, "How can you buy a lawsuit with money? If you do not repent, you will be severely punished." The fraud case was therefore delayed and rescheduled for the 16th.</p>

<h3>The Rice Scramble Has Not Yet Subsided: All Rice Shops in the City Remain Closed; Mayor Wu Urges Rice Merchants to Resume Trading Promptly</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The rice problem is extremely serious. Due to the rampant rice scramble in recent days, most merchants dare not trade. Yesterday, all rice shops in the city unanimously suspended business. In response, the Mayor issued a special order stating: The sale of rationed rice at each rice shop has been ordered to be properly protected by the police. If selling rationed rice at the shop is inconvenient, they can negotiate with the police bureau and district offices to borrow locations for joint distribution. All rice shops in the city must resume business as usual, and those involved in rice grabbing will be severely punished. If rice merchants have any opinions, they can be relayed through the Rice Shop Industry Association. After the Mayor's order, each rice merchant, in light of the rice-grabbing incidents that occurred yesterday, felt that their lives and property could not be guaranteed, so they still did not comply with the order to resume business.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Mayor Wu summoned Qu Zhenhua, the chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, at the municipal government, urging him to prioritize the maintenance of public food supply and persuade all rice merchants to operate with peace of mind. Qu conveyed the opinions of most rice merchants, requesting that the example of Chengdu and Wuxi, where rice grabbers were executed without mercy, be followed and that those involved in rice grabbing in this city be severely punished. Mayor Wu promised to detain and prosecute them. Representatives of the rice merchants also reported that the rice grabbing at Wanxing Xiji Rice Shop in Yangshupu on the afternoon of the 5th was led and initiated by Cao Hongyun, the Baozhang of the 15th Bao in the 20th District, requesting that he be severely punished. Upon hearing this, the Mayor immediately ordered Zhang Xiaosong, the Director of Civil Affairs, to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<p>Request to Receive Rice First and Pay After Selling Out</p>
<p>Rice merchants stated regarding the sale of rationed rice that most of them are currently short of funds, requesting permission to receive rice first and pay after selling it out, adding that this was also the case during the enemy-puppet period. Mayor Wu did not express any opinion on this point but promised to consider it.</p>
<p>According to a responsible person in the rice industry, Huang Wan, in a conversation with a reporter last night: The emotions of the rice merchants are extremely high and difficult to control. Because they feel that their lives and property are not guaranteed, many dare not open their doors for business. Currently, they urgently hope that Speaker Shen can find a way to resolve this rice rush problem.</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the northern market was completely halted, while there was slightly more activity in the southern market. The total arrival of goods was 463 shi. As usual, the Social Affairs Bureau sold 9,000 bags in the southern market. Initially, each rice merchant dared not accept the rationed amount. Later, after Mayor Wu summoned representatives of the rice merchants and promised to dispatch police to protect the sale of rationed rice at the shops, each rice merchant began to accept the rationed amount. The asking price in the market for high-quality white japonica rice was 295,000 yuan, and for medium-quality, 285,000 yuan. For high-quality thin japonica rice, it was 292,000 yuan, and for medium-quality, 284,000 yuan. For medium-quality early indica rice, it was 280,000 yuan. For medium-quality ordinary indica rice, it was 255,000 yuan. For medium-quality white glutinous rice, it was 290,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Two important motions were discussed: (1) The Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District proposed two methods for calculating the cost of 20-count standard yarn: (A) Based on a cost of 1.8 million yuan per dan of raw cotton, excluding profit and unified tax, the cost per piece of yarn would be 8.6 million yuan. (B) Based on an average calculation of 1.8 million yuan per dan of raw cotton and 750,000 yuan per dan of cotton from the United Logistics Administration, excluding profit and unified tax, the cost per piece of yarn would be 6.6 million yuan. After discussion, it was generally believed that when Vice-Chairman Wu proposed a price of 5.5 million yuan per piece of 20-count yarn at the last National Price Commission meeting, the authorities still considered it too high. Therefore, the proposed cost prices are unlikely to be approved by the authorities. However, the government's current negotiated price of 4.6 million yuan is not enough to cover costs. It was resolved that Vice-Chairman Wu would request an adjustment at this week's National Price Commission meeting.</p>
<p>(2) Private yarn factories requested that the government no longer purchase cotton yarn produced from cotton stockpiled at the end of last December, for two reasons: (A) Although cotton was cheap at the end of last year, the value of the legal currency was quite high at that time, which cannot be compared with the present. (B) Based on the current purchase price of 4.6 million yuan, it is not enough to cover the reproduction costs of the yarn factories. After discussion, it was resolved to wait for Vice-Chairman Wu to negotiate with the authorities before a decision is made.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The association is handling the registration of firms applying to transport yarn and cloth to various ports in North China and Hebei Province. So far, more than 500 firms have gone to collect registration forms. The association has scheduled the deadline for firms in this city to apply for registration to be the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Listing Four Reasons to Request Higher Prices</h3>
<p>The China Textile Construction Corporation stated that the difference between the cotton yarn allocation price and the black market price is too large, resulting in huge losses for the company. It recently listed four major reasons, requesting the Ministry of Economy to increase the allocated yarn price. The reasons listed are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the past, the prices of yarn and cloth were determined based on the inventory on hand and the market demand, and they were 3% to 10% lower than the market price. There was no black market for yarn and cloth prices, and it was able to play a restraining role. Since the implementation of allocation prices, cotton yarn prices have been rigidly fixed, and the company has complied with government orders and dared not overstep. However, in recent times, yarn prices have soared everywhere. Taking the Shanghai market as an example, the market price is about one-half higher than the allocated price, which is a huge difference. Each time the company opens yarn for sale, it is close to 3,000 pieces. The total difference between the allocated price and the market price reaches as much as 60 to 70 billion yuan. This price suppression and sale have not actually benefited the common people but have only enriched merchants, causing the national treasury to suffer significant losses, leading to rampant black markets and failing to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices. (2) The more profit merchants earn, the more abundant floating capital becomes, and the more prices soar. The power to hoard and speculate also becomes thicker. (3) Manufacturers should sell cotton yarn at the negotiated price, but in reality, they mostly sell it on the black market and record it at the negotiated price, which reduces the government's tax revenue invisibly. (4) The current price of cotton, using 20-count raw materials as an example, has reached 1.2 million yuan per dan. The income from the company's allocated yarn price is not even enough to cover the cost of raw cotton. Other public taxes and expenses cannot be paid at all. Each time the company sells cotton yarn at allocated prices, assuming a difference of 60 billion yuan, and sells cotton cloth at allocated prices, assuming a difference of 20 billion yuan, the total difference per month is more than 130 billion yuan, and the total amount for the year will be about 1.5 trillion yuan. This is only for Shanghai, and Qingdao and the Northeast are not included. The company's surplus to be paid to the national treasury this year is budgeted at 400 billion yuan, but it is deeply feared that not only will there be no surplus to be paid to the treasury, but the company will also have to request the national treasury to subsidize it.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Ministry of Economy has telegraphed the Textile Industry Management Committee to quickly negotiate yarn prices based on the supply prices of cotton from the United Logistics Administration and has telegraphed the company to strictly abide by national policies and not pursue black market profits before the new negotiated prices for cotton yarn are determined. The Ministry of Economy has specially telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government to strictly prohibit the black market in the city to stabilize the market. The municipal government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3>Man-Made Silk Asking Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>The man-made silk market opened weak yesterday. Number 120, Kosan Yuki, initially asked for 17.2 million yuan, while the lowest asking price in the middle was 7 million yuan. Later, because some real sales customers came to absorb it, it rose back to between 7.3 million and 7.4 million yuan, hovering around. It closed at 3 million yuan at noon, with four or five boxes transacted. Asking prices did not move in the afternoon. As a result, it fell by 700,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Number 75, semi-gloss, is extremely scarce on the market, so yesterday's asking price remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Factory operations have been affected by tight money, and inter-company transactions are extremely rare. Even silk factories rarely purchase. Yesterday's asking prices for all grades were 200,000 to 300,000 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Silk goods also declined along with raw materials, with quilt covers falling by 300,000 yuan and lacking transactions. The large-scale Gezi Bi, because of disputes in the market the previous day, temporarily suspended trading in the market starting yesterday. Off-market transactions were 30,000 yuan to another 500 yuan, 1,500 yuan less than the previous day. Because of the quiet trading, the remaining asking prices generally did not change much.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Resumes Distribution of the 14th Phase</h3>
<p>The distribution of co-operative sugar, which had been suspended for some time, was resumed yesterday by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation in accordance with the regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau, with the distribution of the 14th phase. The allocation price is calculated according to the newly adjusted prices: 350,000 yuan per market dan for Grade A granulated white sugar and 330,000 yuan per market dan for Grade B fine white sugar. The application target is mainly sugar merchants. It is reported that approximately 170,000 bags have been applied for this time. The company believes that this is inconsistent with past facts. To prevent hoarding, special regulations have been set in advance for the allocation method as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The allocation standard is based on the total quantity approved for purchase for each customer from the first to the thirteenth phases of this year, plus the quantity applied for in this phase (the fourteenth phase), and allocating one-fourteenth.</p>
<p>(2) The maximum amount applied for in this phase is limited to 500 bags of each type, half Grade A granulated sugar and half Grade B fine sugar. If it exceeds this limit, it will still be calculated as 500 bags.</p>
<p>(3) The minimum allocation is 15 bags of Grade A granulated sugar. The actual number of allocated units is 347 households, of which 259 households are sugar companies, and the rest are biscuit, candy, canned food, soda, and cooperative companies. The actual allocated amount is 36,000 bags, half Grade A granulated sugar and half Grade B fine sugar. Grade A granulated sugar (gunny bag) is calculated at 180 catties, and Grade B fine sugar (straw bag) is calculated at 120 catties. It is understood that each household has already received the purchase order yesterday, will pay at the Bank of China today, and will receive the warehouse receipt next Monday, with delivery the following day.</p>
<h3>Speaker Pan Urges Shanghai Citizens to Actively Subscribe to US Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, broadcasted on the New Shanghai Radio Station at 6:00 PM on the 8th to encourage citizens to actively subscribe to US dollar bonds. The main points were: The current economic problems must be treated both symptomatically and fundamentally. Everyone should remain calm, not compete for purchases, and not hoard. This is a symptomatic treatment. As for the fundamental treatment, it is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, both for individuals and for the country. At present, the government authorities are working hard to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure. Issuing US dollar bonds is also one of the methods. If all the citizens of Shanghai do their part, the results will be impressive. Mr. Pan also said that he is one of the members of the Bond Fund Supervisory Committee, and all the members of the committee are determined to devote all their energy to safeguarding creditworthiness and will never disappoint the purchasers. Finally, Mr. Pan pointed out that buying US dollar bonds is an expression of supporting the government's financial policies, which is sufficient to prevent inflation. In the future, banknotes will no longer be issued in increased amounts, prices will naturally stabilize, and the phenomenon of economic panic will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>Solicitation Committee Organizes Essay Contest for Universities and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>In order to encourage all Shanghai citizens to actively subscribe to bonds, the US Dollar Bond Solicitation Committee has organized an essay contest for university and secondary school students in this city. The university group's topic is "The Relationship Between the Issuance of US Dollar Bonds and the National Economy and People's Livelihood," and the secondary school group's topic is "Why Should We Buy US Dollar Bonds?" The deadline for submissions is June 15th, and the winners will be announced on July 1st. Seven winners will be selected in each group, with prizes ranging from 1 million yuan to 200,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Selected Poems and Writings of Mr. Yu Youren</h3>
<p>Poetry: On the Road to Beibei on My Birthday (1940)</p>
<p>Who knew my temples would gradually frost? On this long journey, I am busy and forgetful; my body is not renowned in this new era, and my heart, like an orphan, longs for its old home. Timely thunder and rain gladden all things, mountains and rivers devote their strength, and all trades are busy; frequently turning back from the Diamond Heights, how many heroes are on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Three Poems on Encountering Rain at Beibei Hot Springs on My Birthday</p>
<p>The past startles the heart, nineteen years ago; the folk tales still circulate; when Old Ruan was defeated and came west, one bath in this desolate pool shook two provinces.</p>
<p>The old inscriptions by the cliff of the North Spring, the green waters and green hills, and the White Bird Pavilion; I am even more delighted by the extraordinary omen today, the gentle breeze, sweet rain, and the Star of Old Age.</p>
<p>Let us wish that the literati's heritage will flourish for generations to come, and that even the family feasts for three generations will be commonplace; thinking of the matters before the Hall of Inquiries. Half learning from King Wen and half from King Wu.</p>
<p>My Heart's Appointment on My Birthday: Visiting the Nursing Home at South Tongluo Gorge (1941)</p>
<p>Recognizing the road along the river, watching the nursing home when the oak leaves are lush.</p>
<p>Birthday (1945)</p>
<p>The wish to cultivate and graze the rivers and mountains remains unfulfilled; crossing the river in exile, I make do with these passing years; this year I happen to encounter Labor Day, and the orphaned son of gunfire is already white-haired.</p>
<p>On the day of my birth, I temporarily cast aside all worries, the great legacy of Sun Yat-sen is diminished in Ryukyu; the mountain alliance rises in the cause of all humanity, not just singing praises for Asia.</p>
<p>Old House in Doukou Alley (1938)</p>
<p>The withered locust tree behind the hall puts forth flowers again, the wind is calm in front of the hall, and the shade of the trees is slanted; the three old houses are still as they were, ashamed to face the displaced and speak of destroyed homes.</p>
<p>Doukou Farm (1941)</p>
<p>Ten thousand trees tower into the sky, poplars rising like arrows, Jade Screen flies emerald, yielding to the farm; I vow to live out my life by the tomb, knowing there is no return, and with white hair, I reluctantly leave my old home.</p>
<p>Poems from a Journey to Wenchuan (Seven Poems)</p>
<p>The diligence of the sages of the past has not vanished, and beautiful tales are passed down through the distant waters; I once gazed from before the Jade Barrier Pass, the Father and Son Canal and the Husband and Wife Bridge.</p>
<p>Halfway up Mount Min, whiteness extends horizontally, clouds above the green mountains, trees in several layers; how many mountain people gaze and dance, plowing with the rain amidst the clouds.</p>
<p>Sand still flies before Stone Button Mountain, and the millet is just beginning to ripen on Kuerping; where can the vast traces be found? Treading the desolate mountains, my clothes are wet with sweat.</p>
<p>Only two households of Qiang people remain on the ping, and there are crumbling walls in the high places before the ping; the elders in the ping speak of the divine Yu, who cut off the dragon and descended into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Bitter to travel this line on Mount Min, remnants of the market are damp, and I startle frequently in my sleep; knowing how difficult it is for the people to obtain grain, I worry all night hearing the sound of guarding against trouble.</p>
<p>Generations are loyal and upright, and encourage each other, talents are born naturally and without selfishness; Yingying can inherit the family business, the nine-year-old boy before Mount Yu.</p>
<p>The bright virtue of King Yu hangs suspended from ancient to modern times, never calculating Wenchuan and Beichuan; the four seas overflow and are plunged into darkness, when will the land be leveled again?</p>
<p>Historical Accounts of Dunhuang (Eight Poems)</p>
<p>The weary old man speaks of this journey, a heavy steel city in the western frontier; even more so for the sake of the cultural relics of a thousand years, the calligrapher's home and the stone cave sutras.</p>
<p>Halting my horse on the sand mountain, I shed a tear, can I still wield a spear as in the past? The crescent moon above Crescent Spring is now a missing moon, particularly round for the sorrowful man.</p>
<p>The cultural relics of Dunhuang are scattered across the globe, collected with both rarity and exquisiteness; together, we brush off the remnants, together we read and appreciate, under the Mogao Grottoes, we celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Gazing at the traces of fatigue and the remaining ruins, seeing the scripts of Xixia among the discarded texts; do not laugh at me for stamping in the sand, only now in my old age do I see a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Three hundred and eighty caves of wall paintings, from the Northern Song, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties; an immeasurable ocean of national art, I wish to carry you back to the Central Plains.</p>
<p>Mr. Stein and Mr. Pelliot left long ago, the Eastern and Western Grottoes are also lamentable! The study of Dunhuang is already famous throughout the world, dying in service, sitting in seclusion, unaware of the passing years.</p>
<p>The melons are beautiful and fragrant in the tenth month, may I continue this pleasant journey for another ten years; the rock halls and wall palaces are undamaged, with my own hands, I sift through the cold ashes and examine the discarded texts.</p>
<p>Historical Accounts of Wanfo Gorge (Four Poems)</p>
<p>Raging water and wild winds interact, high cliffs become exceptionally clear at night; marking the grottoes under Mount Sanwei, writing of my journey visiting the paintings in a high carriage.</p>
<p>Traces of Sui ink, paintings of the Tang people, layer upon layer of Song smearing with no coverings; not understanding what the high monks say, only the Taoist priests remain guarding the flickering lamps.</p>
<p>Layer upon layer of Buddha paintings, mostly intact, various anecdotes unbearable to hear; two Taoist priests died within five steps, and a building of scriptures was destroyed ten years ago.</p>
<p>Red willows sparsely reflecting the setting sun, the leaves of the phoenix tree are yellow in old age; the water enhances the beautiful colors like a picture, the mountain is like the old and wise elder.</p>
<p>Historical Accounts of Qingcheng (Four Poems)</p>
<p>The red of the nanmu leaves extends from spring to summer, the sacred lamps illuminate the night, with both rain and clear skies; the famous mountain bears flowers, its name known for a long time, not seeing flowers, I drunkenly enjoy peace.</p>
<p>The emerald waves lean eastward, joining the vast expanse, how can I forget the worries before my eyes; Kongtong's cries break the island's silence, a night of anxiety like a battlefield.</p>
<p>I have not returned to the west in a hundred years, only the Mountain of the Medicine King remains; the foolish children offer sacrifices before the mountain, forgetting that the true man dwells here.</p>
<p>Ten thousand carriages go before Mount Damian, there is no way to seek the traces of immortals in the west; today, I bow before the shrine of the Yellow Emperor, only then do I recognize that Ning Feng could fly.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Poems of Tianshan</p>
<p>Snow is like a mountain garment, going like a mountain crown; clean and repeatedly clean, allowing you to look at every side.</p>
<p>Crossing Tianshan, going, crossing Tianshan, returning; where is Yaochi? White clouds come and go, flying.</p>
<p>Reading "You Feng" Poetry at Night (1944)</p>
<p>The days of loss and choice are not yet in sight, why cook mallows and peel dates? The hardworking father and son diligently manage the household, and the shivering farmers pray for a good year. Even with thatched huts in the southern fields, they are still fearful, and the rain in the eastern mountains comes slowly. Without clothes or hemp, I think all day, diligently studying the people of Zhou to save them from chaos.</p>
<p>Sleepless Night at the Ling Mountain Taoist Temple Above Tianchi on the Twelfth Night of August in the Thirty-fifth Year</p>
<p>Flying back and forth across Tianshan, today I truly recognize the face of heaven; waterfalls in the clouds, snow in the ice age, Yaochi under the moon, mountains after the rain. Traveling far, I know the value of a fine steed, climbing high, I do not care about the white hair on my temples; the night is deep, and my feelings are indescribable, ten thousand trees weep and wail, there are sick fir trees.</p>
<p>Lyrics: Lang Tao Sha - Yellow Crane Tower (Written Before the Founding of the Republic)</p>
<p>The ambition to serve the country is difficult to fulfill, the kindness and grudges are vivid; forcing myself to suppress my feelings, I ascend the tower, the Yellow Crane should return and shed tears, tears filling the isles. Leaning against the great river in autumn, poetry and wine exhaust my sorrows, ancient and modern exiled officials and lyricists, may I ask who can ascend the summit? Crying bitterly for the divine land!</p>
<p>Three Songs of Zhe Gu Tian (Written in 1937)</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles of Yunnan jade have not returned, the cultural relics of my home have also turned to ash, the book owner should not mourn Longpan Village, fighting to bring back the gold seal stained with blood. Three-foot sword, a military uniform, I have seen the garden tomb five times; delaying the day of recovering the capital with troops, the people mournfully weep at the temple.</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains stained with blood, and after years the barbarian filth has not been cleared; with difficulty, the imperial ancestors opened the heavenly office, and with hardship, Yuan Gong broke his axe. Striving for independence, and to survive, letting you and I succeed in benevolence; for tens of millions of fine sons and daughters, how can we repay your kindness to the motherland!</p>
<p>Endless sincerity connects all directions, the great marshal holds the sharp sword and guards extraordinarily; the wind goes and makes saints strive to see, the thunder and rain are timely, and the night is not over. The sky rotates directly, the earth's secrets are hidden, the great wind blows across the Pacific Ocean; the goddess of freedom descends gracefully, recognizing her old home in a world stained with blood.</p>
<p>Jin Lü Qu - A Person from Home Describes the Beauty of Our Mountains and Rivers and Encourages Me to Return, I Write This in Response (1938)</p>
<p>Everything starts from scratch, count old Ruan, in his life on the lakes and seas, how many old friends remain? How many of Bao, E, Ying, Liu, and Han Zhi's friends have died in service! Today, the gate of the wind and clouds is still reliable? People say our mountains and rivers are truly magnificent, but these magnificent mountains and rivers require effort to manage; south and north, moreover, there are many ramparts. The great battle of the universe is unparalleled, ashamed am I, living under Mount Emei, in the same village as Wei Gong; not becoming a famous Confucian or a famous general, I ponder in old age; I suppose the world knows why I do this, hearing that three million have died, I am even more willing to let their blood stain the history of opening the sky; seeking peace and freedom for the country.</p>
<p>Su Zhong Qing - September 18th of the Thirtieth Year, Flying from Chongqing to Lanzhou with Geng You</p>
<p>Clouds open and reveal the plains below, today is the best day; flying over the Mountaintop Ridge, the poem is not yet finished, so I use lyrics to convey it. The lyrics are inexhaustible, writing about space, leaking into the world; the rivers and mountains are magnificent, there is no way to describe them, stroking the blue skies.</p>
<p>An Xiang - A Soldier at the Foot of Savage Mountain (1944)</p>
<p>At the foot of Savage Mountain, there are soldiers shouldering spears, their songs are adjacent; white bones in the setting sun, the abandoned ramparts, quiet and beautiful flowers bloom and wither on their own; on duty here today, I am reluctant to leave, my lonely feelings are difficult to write. I only hope to wash the rivers and passes with blood, illuminating the woods; the stars and moon are like a painting, how many times I have shed tears; thinking of the years of exile in the cold season, looking forward to the bright road, worrying about the people overlapping, heaven should be surprised, wondering when it will bestow blessings again, white clouds in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Huan Xi Sha - Small Garden</p>
<p>The clouds on the top of Gele Mountain are half-covered, the sun on Eagle Cliff is about to set; from afar, whose zither music rises? The small garden is still enchanting to the swallows, but I pity the spring rain freezing the paulownia flowers; the noble son is again at the edge of the green grass.</p>
<p>Self-made new lyrics, but not skillful, the clear sounds of mountains and rivers are unlike anything in the past; pondering the past even more sadly. The Yangtze River acts as a blue ribbon coiled left and right, connecting with the Jade Barrier, arching west and east, I wonder how many times the returning boat will catch the wind?</p>
<p>Man Jiang Hong - Level Rhyme</p>
<p>Unable to sleep at four o'clock on December 9th, using Bai Shi's tune to write the heart of Wu Mu, I completed this lyric.</p>
<p>Countless heroes rise in response to the times, vying to go to the battlefield; startling is holding a spear without self, with the motherland as the destruction; flying past the towering Himalayas, fighting back to the homeland from the Nu River front; seeing freedom flowers blooming everywhere before the horses, heaven scatters fragrance. New era, new national defense, new China, longevity without limit, putting the deep pain of a hundred years into the Pacific Ocean; world peace has a responsibility, the construction of China is even more appropriate; waiting a short time to report to the temple at Zijin Mountain, praying for a constitution.</p>
<p>Bai Zi Ling - Inscription on Standard Cursive Script</p>
<p>Cursive script literature is a tool for the self-strengthening of the Chinese nation; since the oracle bone inscriptions, seal script and clerical script have been added, each with its hanging needles and drooping dew, the Han bamboo slips flowed less, the Tang sutra stone caves, countless evolutions; the chapter script, the present script, and the wild script are deeply buried, who cares about them for a long time! May I ask the people of the world, who cherish every moment, what is the hurry? With the same time and the same hands, whose efficiency reaches the highest? The symbols are magical, the old man discovers them, and the secret is to pass them on, respectfully inviting comrades to open up the road for academics.</p>
<p>Huan Xi Sha - Written on the Plane Going West to Hami (1946)</p>
<p>I and Tianshan share white hair, reflecting each other, we are also dashing; I envy the snow water irrigating the fields. The winds, rains, worries, and sorrows have become the past, the mountains and rivers are haggard after many autumns; going in the evening, I gather in all the fragrant islands.</p>
<p>Tune</p>
<p>Inscription on the Comprehensive History of the War of Resistance Against Japan (1938)</p>
<p>[Duplet: Dian Qian Huan] Noisy crows, the Central Plains is full of Ming trumpets, peering at the barbarian horses along the rivers, do not sigh! See the divine land release exotic flowers, winning the battle in one fell swoop, I picture the bloody history, calling out even louder, Long live China, long live China!</p>
<p>Hearing that Japan is About to Surrender, Creating the Chinese Music Bureau (Ten Songs)</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>[Duplet: Zui Gao Ge] Ten thousand families light firecrackers at night, the light of auspiciousness dawns on humanity; let us try to open our hearts, in the mirror the old man is gradually aging.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>[Previous Tune] Bury the golden light mountain, place it in the heart of the Yalu River by the moon; the moon in Lugou is dark, the Great Wall is broken, the barbarian horses neigh in the wind for several years.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>[Previous Tune] The Yellow River water levels surrounding the border wall, the White Emperor goes to seal the embroidered ruins; ten thousand spirits devote their lives to the people's direction, the great task opens, and the laws go forward.</p>

<p>[Previous Tune] In those years, the fires of war flowed, who came to deliver water when they were thirsty; the fisherman casts his net, the woodcutter sleeps, all are scarlet ramparts for the military to leave.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>[Previous Tune] Who plays the sorrowful song of the Czech, who indulges in the lazy war flames of Poland; all the concubines are exhausted, Paris is broken, the two-faced soldiers are like the sun.</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>[Previous Tune] The strait is a small matter of waves, the red field is vast, the moon is cold; death will turn to the mandate of heaven in an instant, the song of tomorrow draws laughter.</p>

<p>[Previous Tune] How does freedom grow? The war has just reaped its results; the Chinese nation is vying to celebrate, the royal way, a defense city, is me.</p>
<h3>Portrait of Mr. Yu Youren</h3>
<h3>Preface to the Thousand Character Classic in Standard Cursive Script with Corrections</h3>
<p>— Yu Youren</p>
<p>In the twenty-first year of the Republic, I established the Standard Cursive Script Society in Shanghai, extensively seeking the legacy of cursive saints from past generations, as well as Han and Jin bamboo slips and stone tablets, engaging in the organization of cursive script. The reasons for its dedication and the ultimate hope are to make the national cultural tool of more than two thousand years simpler, easier, more enjoyable, unified, and more practical. Therefore, the selection of characters is based on being easy to recognize, easy to write, beautiful, and accurate. The materials are also sought from the authors of the Zhang, Jin, and Kuang schools, so that each can make the most of their strengths and have the opportunity for balanced development. For this reason, what can be comforting to the world at this time is that in the selection of materials and characters, we have discovered the ancestral legacy accumulated over generations, a sharp weapon for progress in the new era, so that order can be found in chaos and rebellion. What is regrettable is that the era is distant, so the materials are insufficient, and the carvings are often distorted. The era is near, so the practicality is narrow, and there are few famous works passed down. It is very difficult to create a systematic ordinance! In the past, Xu Shuozhong wrote "Shuowen", and he did not determine the characters throughout his life. Chong began to present the book to Emperor An, showing the difficulty of urgently organizing characters like burning heart. I have been governing this for only ten years, relying on the help of my colleagues, and I have achieved initial success, which is also fortunate!</p>
<p>In the twenty-fifth year, the Hanwen Zhengkai Publishing House printed 500 copies to rush out the book, and the explanations were incomplete. In the twenty-sixth year, the second revised edition was about to be printed, but at the same time that the War of Resistance and construction were advancing, there were things that should be done, and I should rush there. Moreover, writing is the crystallization of human culture, the connection of human life, and also the total driving force of world civilization. It is also important for hundreds of industries and tens of thousands of products, which are closely related to the survival and life of the country and the nation. The construction of a new country is even more dependent on the progress of writing to promote it and speed up its success. The strong countries of Europe and America have made scientific progress, and their writing is also simple. Printing uses regular script, and writing uses chapter script, and those who learn it all know its convenience. Our country's writing is difficult, and if we want to stand on our own in the fiercely competitive world, the result must change, or it will all fall behind. From the perspective of time, Dayu cherished every moment, and Tao Kan cherished every minute, "Time, time," is what the sages valued so much! Now we know that what we should cherish and fight for today, calculated in minutes and inches, has been miscalculated! Therefore, the foundation of the country and nation for tens of thousands of generations should start from one point, one stroke, one flicker, and one second; the strength or weakness, success or failure of people and countries is determined by the length and amount of time they have gained. Although writing reform is a matter of saving time, it is a small matter, but with its wide use, it adds up to the infinite days and months of our entire nation in the future! For several years, I have not dared to slacken, and after two consultations, I have re-edited it. In the twenty-seventh year, I handed it over to the China Printing Bureau to print 300 copies, and in the twenty-ninth year, I printed 500 copies. I planned to sell them after a review, but in the meantime, only a few copies were distributed to friends, and the rest were stranded in Hong Kong, and could not be transported back. This made those who care about cultural undertakings and know that I have devoted myself to this wait endlessly, and I am deeply uneasy.</p>
<p>In recent years, the national construction has been advancing by leaps and bounds, but the work of writing reform that we are responsible for cannot catch up. How regrettable! This spring, my colleagues in the club gradually gathered, and I re-selected and reviewed it once. The book is divided into two volumes, the upper volume is the Thousand Character Classic of Cursive Saints, the characters are all selected from the cursive saints of ancient dynasties, carefully making the shapes, and listing the sources; the lower volume is the Explanations of the Standard Cursive Script, which summarizes the changes in cursive script from ancient to modern times, and explains them with examples. The standard symbols are made into tables, marked "Sheng Qian", "Shi Li", mutually annotating each other. The former provides the essence of cursive writing, and the latter clarifies the secrets of calligraphy history that are not passed down.</p>
<p>I am deeply afraid that the principles will be correct but the use will be wrong, or that the words that the ancients created occasionally will be forced on later generations who are difficult to learn. During the selection and review, I often use pens and paper to test whether they are in line. Comrade Liu Yantao has accumulated what he has written before and after, selected and hooked them into a book, and also requested that they be printed together with the Standard Cursive Script, as a reference for those who learn the Thousand Character Classic of Cursive Saints, and to increase the interest of calligraphy learners! He has worked diligently, and his contributions to me are the most. It is extremely important that my colleagues are thinking of publicizing cursive script and liberating writing, and they are doing everything they can. In the past, a certain master practiced the cursive script of a former sage, and he did not achieve success all day long, and said with joy: "The truth is also in front of me, making people discouraged!" I feel the same way now when I write this! Fortunately, the Standard Cursive Script can be printed and completed, and the principles of symbol organization and the changes in the rules are explained in detail in a list. Today's scholars will surely be encouraged and work hard, and there will be even more amazing inventions. July in the thirty-first year, Yu Youren wrote in the mountain cave.</p>
<p>Wishing Mr. Yu Youren a Happy Birthday - Zhu Jingxin</p>
<p>Today is the sixty-ninth birthday of Mr. Yu Youren, the president of the Control Yuan. I remember that when Mr. Yu celebrated his sixty-seventh birthday in Chongqing in the thirty-fourth year, he wrote two poems (already seen in this publication) which can be regarded as his biography. When Mr. Yu was born, the Qing Dynasty was昏庸, the government was corrupt, and there were foreign troubles. Therefore, he had the ambition of耕牧 the rivers and mountains since childhood. In these sixty-nine years, from the revolution to the Northern Expedition to the War of Resistance, he has repeatedly fought against the evil forces of violence, writing the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese nation. Mr. Yu can just represent the Chinese people of the firecrackers, shouting to mankind.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's ancestral home is Jingyang, Shaanxi, and he lives in Sanyuan, so he was born in Xinzhuang, Sanyuan. His fluttering silver beard is the demeanor of a man from Guanzhong. He lost his mother at the age of three, and was raised by his aunt, Madam Fang. At the age of seven, he entered the school, and at the age of eleven, he studied with Mr. Mao Banxiang in Sanyuan. At the age of fourteen, he entered the county school, at the age of twenty, he supplemented the 　, and at the age of twenty-five, he passed the imperial examination. Mr. Yu was extremely dissatisfied with the corruption of the Qing Dynasty, and once printed "The Half-Crying, Half-Laughing Building Poems" to satirize the current government. The magistrate of Sanyuan County pointed him out as a revolutionary party and reported him to the governor of Shaanxi. The governor then requested to dismiss him as a juren and strictly arrest him. At that time, Mr. Yu was in Bianliang for the Ministry of Rites examination. Mr. Li Yutian, a fellow villager, sent someone to secretly inform him. Mr. Yu then went south in secret to Shanghai and entered Aurora University, studying under Mr. Ma Xiangbo.</p>
<p>In the thirty-first year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Aurora University was dissolved due to the interference of foreign teachers. Mr. Yu was ordered by Mr. Ma to establish Fudan Public School in Wusong. At this time, students studying in Japan returned to China due to the ban on the tide, and they also founded China Public School in Paotai Bay. Mr. Yu was also listed as a founder and served as the national language lecturer. Soon, he and his colleagues from the two schools initiated the Shenzhou Daily. After the agreement, Mr. Yu and Mr. Shao Lizi went to Tokyo to raise shares and met with President Sun Yat-sen in Tokyo. It was at this time that he joined the Tongmenghui. Therefore, the publication of Shenzhou Daily was welcomed by the intellectual class for promoting the revolution. In less than a year, Shenzhou Daily suffered a fire, and Mr. Yu resigned and reorganized Yu Lun Daily.</p>
<p>In the beginning, revolutionaries founded newspapers one after another to promote nationalism, and they fell one after another, which was a brilliant era in the history of newspapers. At that time, there were newspapers advocating revolution, which were known as the three people of Jian Tian and the three people of Heng. The so-called three people of Jian were the three newspapers of Min Hu, Min Yu, and Min Li, all of which were founded by Mr. Yu. After Shenzhou Daily was burned, Mr. Yu had already left, but the idea of advocating revolution always lingered in his mind. Not long after serving as the editor of Yu Lun Daily, he founded Chang Hu Daily. In the publication notice, there was a statement for the people, which was noted by the Qing court. After the publication, the advocacy was intense, and it was even more disliked by the Qing officials. He was trapped in prison for the Gansu account incident. Although the prison was later released, the publication of the newspaper was still a condition for his release. Mr. Yu then went to Japan. The following year, he returned to Shanghai and founded Min Li Daily again. At that time, the Qing court's defense against the revolution was more serious, but the editor made progress more quickly than before. On the eve of the Wuchang Uprising, Min Li Daily became the general organ of the revolutionary army. The news of the war was announced by Min Li Daily every day, and everyone wanted to see it first. The printing machine did not stop all night, but there were still people who were unable to obtain it.</p>
<p>In the seventh year of the Republic, the enemy in Guanzhong was in great distress. Mr. Yu responded to the invitation of the generals of the Jingguo Army and went north to preside over the Shaanxi Jingguo Army affairs. Although the number of people was very different and the food and salary were not enough, he was still able to deal with the strong enemy for several years. This was all due to Mr. Yu's sincerity, so they all died without yielding. In particular, in the Jingguo Army District, the promotion of the doctrine, the implementation of education, and the promotion of cultural affairs were able to cooperate with military affairs and promote it, so that the people of the Northwest were able to be nurtured by the spirit of the times and become the pioneers of the revolutionary forces in the North. Until the eleventh year of the Republic, the military situation became increasingly difficult, and Mr. Yu left the army and went east, passing through Wuhan to Shanghai. The Jingguo Army affairs came to an end.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Republic, Liu Zhenhua led his troops into Shaanxi and surrounded the city of Chang'an. Mr. Yu wanted to help Shaanxi but the road was blocked, so he took the road to Soviet Russia, crossed Mongolia south, and arrived in Shaanxi. At that time, General Tong Kuai Xiang also returned from Soviet Russia. Wan jointly established the National Army Allied Forces and swore an oath in Wuyuan. Mr. Yu then went to Sanyuan and joined the local militias of the 2nd and 3rd armies to relieve the siege of Chang'an. At that time, Chang'an had been besieged for eight or nine months, and tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians had been killed. Mr. Yu, as the commander-in-chief and acting provincial government official, comforted the soldiers and civilians and planned to deploy troops. In less than two months, he wanted to meet the Northern Expedition army in Zhengzhou.</p>
<p>When Mr. Yu first went to Tokyo to meet President Sun Yat-sen, President Sun Yat-sen appointed Mr. Yu as the Grand Governor of the Yangtze River. After the founding of the Republic, President Sun Yat-sen took the position of the first President in Nanjing and appointed Mr. Yu as the Minister of Transportation. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and Mr. Yu served as a Standing Committee Member of the Party, Government, and Military Affairs. The following year, he served as the President of the Audit Yuan. In the twentieth year of the Republic, Mr. Yu took office as the President of the Control Yuan, and has been in office for sixteen years. His reputation for being upright and upright is universally recognized.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's calligraphy and his silver beard are both famous throughout the country. His characters are like dragons and snakes dancing, and at first glance, they seem extremely easy, but upon closer inspection, every stroke is divine. This is due to his deep skill. Mr. Yu first followed the Northern Wei Dynasty, then studied running script in middle age, and in recent years has focused on Zhangcao. He does not adhere to one school of calligraphy, and he often imitates the famous works of ancient and modern times, one character at a time, one stroke at a time, which has reached a magical state. He often imitates the two characters of Sun Wen, which were personally signed by President Sun Yat-sen, and the character 與 written by the martyr Huang 　. Not only are they powerful, but they are also exquisitely superb. Mr. Yu's calligraphy has reached a magical realm, but he does not cherish ink like gold. Whether it is a comrade, a friend, or even a peddler, even if he has never met him, he will gladly respond. Therefore, Mr. Yu's calligraphy can be seen everywhere on the market. If you go to Lan Yuan, then all the winning plaques and signboards of the organizations, schools, temples, and shops are almost all written by Mr. Yu alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu also believes that our country's characters are anti-corrosive, and writing is time-consuming, and simplified characters violate the principles of philology. Therefore, he advocates cursive script, believing that it is convenient for writing, quite beautiful, and in line with the purpose of the ancients in creating characters. In the twenty-first year of the Republic, the Standard Cursive Script Society was founded in Shanghai, collecting cursive script steles and rubbings, and engaging in organization, from divergent to unified, from spiritual to practical. It is truly a "sharp weapon of the new era."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's achievements and articles do not need to be repeated. Although he has reached the high age of sixty-nine, his spirit is still extremely strong, making young people see him and their emotions become even more excited, making old people see him and relive their youthful feelings, and making the sick and weak see him and encourage their courage to fight. His spirit is stronger than most people.</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing Mr. Yu to be as evergreen as pine and cypress!</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing the Chinese nation infinite longevity!</p>
