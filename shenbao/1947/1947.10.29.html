<h3>王外長赴牯謁主席　行前出席下院例會報告　張院長返京將再赴華南</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕王外長甫歸都門，廿七日晨九時即出席政院例會，報吿出國情形及有關外交各問題，歷一小時之久，報吿內容約分五點：　聯合國大會，　對日和約，　朝鮮閒題，　巴勒斯坦問題，　美國援華問題。關於對日和約，王氏表示我必堅持兩點，一爲日木必須解除武裝，以防侵略再起，一爲保持否決權之運用，以爲我國權益之保障。王氏稱：渠在日對記者所作之談話，日本朝野均極重視，並表歡迎。關於美援華問題，王氏稱：不論自任何方面視之，此事均已好轉，王氏報吿畢，各政委提出詢間多起，王氏均作答，當時並有討論，至十一時王氏始離會。下午一時半應蔣主席召，偕長公子乘「天雄」號飛　，轉登牯嶺，詳陳出席第二屆聯合國大會經過，二三日後返京。</p>

<h3>中英商約談判　港九及内河航權爲問題癥結　倫敦否認無限期延擱</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕自去春與中美商約同時開始談判之巾英商約，迄近兩年，仍鮮成就，京中忽有擱淺之說，外部對此表示沉默，英方則稱係技術問題延擱，唯據記者自權成方而探悉，雙方各有所持，我國認爲港九問題爲僅存之不平等條約遺跡，應趁商約之簽訂，加以澈底解決，俾增進中英友誼，且使廢除不平等條約之努力竟其全功。英國則大爲不然，必欲保留此皇冠上之寶石，以爲其發展對遠東尤以中國貿易之踏板，對歸還港九事，堅拒考慮，更作長期建設永久管轄之　。至英方所堅持者，爲擬再取得中國內河航權，蓋自中英新約簽訂，英國放棄是項特權以至勝利後中國海口重開，兩年來由於英人自顯之不暇，其在華貿易營利之損失，殊使彼等痛惜，故有捲土重來之想。然我外交當局以不平等條約之廢除幾歷艱苦，方有此等解除桎梏之成果，決不能再作類似之讓步，以致喪國權，失民心。英議會訪華團對此項要求，曾作試探性之談話，已招致中國官方與民間輿論之譴資抗議，故此事亦絕無可能。中英商約談判因面臨此等事件及情勢，日前進度極緩，我國所提對案，仍在英方研究之中心，俟其研究結果送還我國後，方可有進展之望。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿七日電〕星期觀察報載，倫敦方面已決定將中英商約之談判無限期延擱，英外部發言人今予以否認，謂與事實不符。並稱：條約談判之延緩，主要原因不外：　英國多數社團與小規模商業團體，皆與此約有利害關係，而必須諮商。　英國之貿易專家，刻正在日內瓦參加國際貿易組織之憲章及其他事宜，發言人並謂，觀察報所謂條約談判之恢復，有待中國政府態度之改變一節，絕對不確。</p>

<p>貝文於述及適用德國經濟統原則之困難時稱：吾人亦不能完全歸咎蘇聯，法國對於鐵路及共他等中央機構，由於對法法國之影響，表示深刻關切。法國原不曾參加波茨坦會議，法國提出之保留，卒使中央機構至今未能成立。今德國之經濟統一尚未建立，蘇軍區之物產仍被提作賠償，工廠亦被搬走。今年七月間，吾人在巴黎發見諸強間至繼續難以協議，並鑒於德國及德境我佔領區所面臨之慘劇，因此余不得不採取任何步縣以使英佔領區得以自給。因此，美國提出與其佔領區合併之建議時，英政府即予接受。不料合併協定成立後，美國麥價直綫上漲，自一元七角五分每一蒲式耳升達三元，於是原有之計算基礎究全失去效用，而吾人遂不能獲取適當之糧食，以維特配糧數量。吾人在莫斯科已曾聲明，不能長使關於德國工業之水準不能成立協會，茍他國不能協會，則英美將自行訂立標準。今外長會議召開在即，若該會議因吾人之堅持此一原則而失敗，當非吾人之過。</p>
<h3>英美政府批准　魯爾礦方案　　　〔路透社倫敦廿七日電」英外交部</h3>
<p>今夜宣布：英美政府業已批准兩國專家上月在華盛頓議定魯爾煤礦移交德人經營，而由英美合組之管制委員會予以監營之建議。又據權威方面息，英，法，美三國政府並已批准英，美，法代表在柏林舉行煤產談判後發表之公報。據英外部之聲明稱：英美極盼關於魯爾煤礦生產及經營之建議案，俟興法，比，荷，盧森堡交換意見畢，即能付諸施行。</p>
<h3>蘇伊關係呈惡化　伊朗圖恢復具林島主權</h3>
<p>（路透社德黑蘭廿七日電）報載：伊朗國會議員昨召開秘密會議起草法案，準備向議會提出責成伊政府派軍隊及文　官員，前往波斯灣之貝林島，以恢復伊朗在該處之主權。（按貝林島爲產油地，原屬獨立地位之土地，受土　之統制，而與英國有條約關係，伊朗一再宜稱該島爲其所有，英國從未予以承認），伊報復謂，伊朗議員在秘密會議中，且曾討　外　蘇駐伊大使沙基柯夫即將離伊之報告。伊報俗又日，蘇大使館已向伊外交部索取蘇丹納總理上周向國會報告蘇伊　浦談判經過之報告書副本。又悉伊王於今日慶祝其誕辰時，蘇大使館館員廿五人雖被邀參加，結果僅五人蒞臨，沙　柯夫等均未至，使伊人對蘇所將採取之下一行動，益多揣測。</p>
<h3>小型大會案　中法均反對擴大權力小組會卒通過美建議</h3>
<p>（中央社成功湖廿七日電）聯大政委會之起草委會，今決定美國所提之「大型大會」應一併處兩國遭遇失敗，按該委會之此種決議，乃代表美國之勝利。美國對中法两阿力求緊縮小型大會之權力，曾表反對。中國之立塲依顧維鈞所言，乃如將「爭端」納入小型大會權力範開以內，則使人感覺其將與安理會之處理爭端之權力相衝突。顧氏謂，如小型大會係處現安理會曾經處理而無法解決之爭端，則又當別論。</p>
<h3>聯大譴責「戰爭販子」案　蘇獲精神上勝利　原案否決採納折哀建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿七日電〕聯合國政委會廿七日贈蘇聯一大精神勝利，以五十六票對零票通過折　案，「不論任何國家，所從事以　動或鼓勵威脅和平，破壞和平，或侵略行為，均應加以譴責，並請每一會員國採取適當步驟促進各國在憲章範圍內之友好關係」。經三小時半之會議，投票十三次，美國發覺如再反對折衷案，必將遭遇慘敗，乃勉强與各國採取相同立塲，投票贊成最後建議而僵局率告打開。此爲意在和解之各小國協力拉壩各趨極端之美蘇兩國，採納中問計劃獲得成就之第一次。投票進行中，兩大國態度開始動搖，蘇聯首先取消譴責美希土三國販賣戰爭之條文，政委會續將隊提案之剩餘部份加以否決，並動議接受法澳加之折衷提案。</p>
<h3>聯合國斡旋委員今日飛印尼首都</h3>

<h3>少年警察隊出動　今日開始查菜館　對違背節約者定四項處理步驟　暫不涉家庭中宴會</h3>
<p>本市筵席節約，已於二十日正式開始。市政當局爲澈査各中西菜館是否切實遵行起見，曾由警察局指派女警卅人，並由難童敎養院選擇兒童五十人，組織少年警察隊，分組出發檢査。茲悉該項檢査工作，定今日起正式開始，由警察及社會兩局督導少年警察隊隊員，分批往各菜館開始檢査，如發現有違背節約會議所定之菜價情形，將依下列步驟處理：　勸吿，　警吿，　罰款，　吊銷營業執照。至此次檢査隊員對各家庭宴會，暫不予以干涉。同時市府已令飭財政及警察兩局，隨時派遣便衣人負，往各菜館密査。〔又訊〕筵席節約辦法中規定之客飯限價，每客爲二萬五千元。但全市菜館中所售客飯，最高僅售二萬元，最低爲一萬元。故該項節約限價，反有提高售價之嫌。茲據市府負責人對記者解釋稱：客飯限價每客二萬五千元，宣係規定之最高價格，俾限制今後客飯售價，均不得超過此數。</p>
<h3>沈秘書長答覆當前多種問題　囤積如無嫌疑當予啟封發還　希望延長禁舞執行時間</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府秘書長沈宗濂，昨日接見記者，答覆各項問題，分誌如次：</p>
<p>民食問題；本市存米並不缺乏，外傳將實行計口授糧，本人認爲因國人食米食麥習慣不同，實行時或有困難，在目前並非非辦不可者。</p>
<p>經濟檢査：最近一般人士對於經濟檢査或有誤會，以爲正當商人存貨遭受封存，影響營業，處置過當，實則警局實施檢査工作，完全係根據密報，有囤積嫌疑始行檢査。依據法令，非業內商人而有囤積實據者，除沒收外，並須嚴辦。業內商人，則核其賬目是否有囤積嫌疑，再決定處置。此爲經濟檢査取締囤積投機之原則，並非査封以後即不准營業，或即予充公之謂。如進出各貨，確屬正當營業，並無囤積嫌疑，當然予以啓封發還。</p>
<p>鄭重說明·禁舞問題　禁舞問題：巾央節約督導委員會定二十九日在京召開，將討論及上海禁舞問題。社會局長吳開先於廿八日晚赴京參加有所報吿，本人須鄭重說明者，市府並非不贊成禁舞，亦並非不執行巾央命令，惟顧念一般舞廳從業人員之生計問題，希望執行時期略予延長，俾使彼等有充份之轉業機會而已。</p>
<p>廿萬難民·亟待救濟　冬令救濟問題：本年各地因災亂來滬之難胞，至少達二十萬人，在此二十萬難胞中，亟待救濟者至少逾十萬人。地方政府機關人力財力有限，希望各界及各慈善團體一致合作提倡，共襄義舉。</p>
<p>汽車問題·所傳不實　限制使用汽車問題：本市遵照中央意旨，暫時停止汽車過戶及停發新牌照，一面請政院核示詳細辦法。傳聞本市車輛有南京領照，重返上海行駛者，依據規定，外埠汽車在本市行駛僅准使用一個月，逾限則不發購油證，且何種人可使用汽車，何種人不得使用汽車，中央所定辦法係普遍性，並非因地方而不同，故此說實屬錯誤。</p>
<h3>社會局民政業務劃歸民政局管理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕原由社會局執掌之一部份有關民政業務，即將劃歸新近成立之市民政局主管。此項業務包括下列六項：　集團結婚，　義務勞働，　新生活運動，　敬老尊賢，　敎堂寺廟之登記，　各種節日之紀念慶祝工作。</p>

<h3>全體獄囚求作新民　黃紙墨筆工楷聯名上書參會</h3>
<p>司法行政部將於十一月五日在京召開全國司法會議，立憲後之大赦條例，屆時亦在討論之列。上海監獄全體囚犯聞訊後，昨日聯名具呈市參議會，要求　請當局注意「寬刑厚赦」原則，予全國囚犯以「重作新民」之機會。原函全長三千字左右，以墨筆工楷，書於黃色毛邊紙上，茲摘錄原函所提之三項呼　如下：</p>
<p>赦典恩澤未能遍沾</p>
<p>我們犯罪的動機，旣這樣的可憐憫，而以民國三十六年元旦國府所頒的火赦令而言，若稍暗（諳）法律者，即可指出其僅是外示其惠而不沾其澤的應時點綴令文。我們試揭開中國之刑法一讀，其巾除風化，扒竊等篇外，其餘均已廢黜不用，代之者爲「懲治、漢奸」，「懲治食汚」，「懲治盜匪」，「懲治烟毒」四種特種刑事條例。而這四種特種條例，除懲治盜匪一項因最重本刑之限制獲得减刑外，其餘三種俱不在大赦令的赦减例內。故事實上確能沐澤赦免恩典者，亦僅不待赦令而亦能短期出獄之扒竊風化等罪而已。奈何政府旣　矜無辜而赦，焉又吝而不予失足者以改悔前愆之機會呢。寖假而政府認我們盡是些罪大惡極的元兇巨憝，那麽我們中也有很多是在定獄時經法官認爲合乎刑法第五十九條的可恕情形而酌减其刑的，這就可證明我們都是些誤罹法綱或生計所迫的失足者。我們根本不是以犯罪爲常業的累犯，然而我們在政府赦典難常恩澤廣佈天下的赦令中，却並不因爲可恕而沐澤到政府的恩典。</p>
<p>老弱婦孺嗷嗷待哺　　對於政府的立法與威信，當然是有其因時制宜的必要，人民除了服從外，是無可訾議的。我們並不冀欲掩飾我們的罪行，我們已自食其果的受到法律的制裁。但是政府在「拍蒼蠅不打老虎」的措置下，對於所調因時制宜的「嚴法」，究已獲得了幾許的實效呢。事實可吿訴我們，至現在爲止，（自民國卅六年元旦起），全國羈獄的囚犯人數，據統計已達一百五十餘萬人，這是超過了任何以往年度的紀錄。我們姑以每一囚犯平均有五口家屬計，那麼在現社會中，就有六百餘萬老弱婦孺，孤苦無依的苦難人民，他們是無罪的，他們那嗷嗷待哺生活在飢饉的境遇，是値得政府的救濟與憫憐的。</p>
<p>希望頒行服役條例　　我們的痛苦唯身受者方能知之，我們的遭遇雖是咎有應得，惟每一個溺水的人是沒有不想獲救而達彼岸的。我們雖然經過了慘深的餘痛，墮入了黑暗的深淵裘，但爲着我們那可憐的家屬，只要我們能喘息尙存，我們當然是希望自由與光明的來臨的。政府的寬赦，常然是我們禱香以求的，我們更希望司法當局能像軍法當局一樣的頒行一種保服勞役的條例，並且祈求條例的限制及尺度儘量寬弛，手續務求簡化，以資補救。對於初次誤罹法網的犯罪者，應予以恩典從寬治罪或改科緩刑，俾我們能多一洗心革面重作新民的機會。」</p>

<h3>被支解的和平女神醫療費需三十萬萬　只待參議會通過即可籌款修理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海的銅像石像紀念碑，算起來着實不少，其中有許許多多是很少人熟悉的。可是無論如何，祗要戰前住在上海的，都會記得曾經矗立在洋涇浜外灘一座巨大的「和平之神」銅像。女神頭向下埀，兩手撑開，下面設銅碑，那是爲紀念第一次歐洲大鼬中協約國陣亡將士而建立的。不幸和平之神的威力敵不過野心家的惡勢力，二次大戰不久又爆發起米，日本人不知道和平，祗知道製造藥彈，當「皇軍」的槍砲裏開不出砲彈時，他們就看中了和平之神身上的大量銅鐵，於是不惜工本，不顧一切，把一座完整的女神和陪伴女神的二位天使都拆毀搬走。幸而好戰者不久便無條件投降，和平之神終於負傷回到了英領事館，未遭毀滅。但是她的身體，翼膀，和同伴們都已成了四分五裂形狀。英領事館因爲無法將這樣重大的銅像保藏，（因爲單以女神上半身來講，也非機器吊車堅不起來），祗能將她堆在空塲上，日曝夜露，與一圈圈生了銹的鐵絲網爲伍。</p>
<p>最近英國聯合服務會一方面不忍將女神棄入火坑，一方面覺得這個世界也實在需要一些和平的氣味來警惕，因此提議市政府將其修復。吳市長也有此同感，故向市參議會提出請求討論此案作一決定。經參議會工務小組委員會商討結果，準備在這回第四次大會續會時提請決議。</p>
<p>但和平之神的修建費用，却很可觀。照目前的估價，全部工程（包括合墓等），要恢復原狀，約需三十億元。其損壞的情形是：大小銅像三尊已分成六塊，女神像前右肩部下陷，頭部右歪，後腦頂凹，兩翼已斷，其中左翼尖端損缺約長五呎，寬二呎，前板缺一塊約長四呎半；寬二呎，高一呎。同時塔下三面浮雕全部無存。市府的計劃擬將神像修復，塔座台墓加固，靠黃浦駁岸亦須加建，否則難免有傾坍之虞。修復後，像下浮雕改用二次大戰勝利紀念方式，改刋碑文，及紀念浮雕，以符現狀。</p>
<p>至於這筆經費　　措辦法，則打算組織一委員會，聯合在滬各國僑民通力合作捐集款項，並由市庫負担一部份藉示倡導。這件提案，就只等本次參議會大會如何決定了，如果通過辦理，則不久之後，和平之神將再度雄峙江岸，重與我個見面。</p>

<h3>女靑年會代表　裴琴等在杭談　瑞典和新西蘭</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿五日訊〕記者趁着世界女靑年會在杭州開會之便，曾分訪了不少國家單位的代表，廣泛地交換些關於戰後生活，國家經濟，敎育制度，婦女地位等意見，然而不談則已，一談彼此都是滿腹牢騷。對於現狀，大家都有大多的對現實之不滿意。這彷彿興冲冲地抬起頭來看太陽，而天空却老是佈滿着重重的愁雲一樣。——幸而，這愁雲，給瑞典和新西蘭的代表吹散了。</p>
<p>兩女士　發表傲語</p>
<p>白克拉久克蘭小姐（MissKajsa　BarckLagergern）和裴琴小姐，（Miss　Jean　Begg），瑞典和新西蘭的女靑年會代表，用着那樣頗値自傲的語調對我說：「我們國家中人人有飯吃，人人有工做，人人有書讀」。</p>
<p>白克拉久克蘭小姐說：「瑞典國內凡八歲至十三歲的兒童，必須强迫入學，十四歲以前的孩子，絕對不准入廠作工。</p>
<p>每星期　四十小時</p>
<p>裴琴小姐說：「新西蘭足以向全世界驕傲的，是實行每星期工作四十小時制。在我們國家中，任何老　都無權利可以叫伙計從事超過每星期四十小時的工作，工人每天工作不到七小時，星期六下午和禮拜天大家都有休假。」</p>
<p>大中小　學生免費</p>
<p>她們大家標榜自己國家的長處，似不勝其高傲者。事實上，從記者個別訪問中，發現瑞典和新西蘭確實是有很多相同而足以成爲各國模範的優點。在敎育方面，學校都由政府辦理，從幼稚園，小學，中學，而大學，完全免費。瑞典進高級專科學校，須酌收最低費川，但家境淸寒的，即可請求豁免。普通中等學校，採男女同校制，到高級學院時，多採男女分校制。男生多一點體格訓練課程，女生則加有烹飪，縫紉等科目。因爲讀書免費，所以每個人都有受敎育的機會，而男女敎育也自然是絕對平等的。</p>
<p>職業方面，國內每個人都有工作。新西蘭則嚴格實施每星期四十小時制，瑞典雖無此制度，但每個人都有合理的工作時間，並可以得到他應有的報酬，足以維持水準以上的生活。因此，在那裏，往往在六時半以後，便找不到吃晚飯的地方，因爲大家都回家享受天倫之樂了。</p>
<p>不論是在瑞典或新西蘭，凡國民不分男女，一到七十五歲，便可以得到一筆很可觀的退休金。同時政府辦有養老院，只要付最低的代價，便可以度優閑的老年生涯。因此，訛都用不到爲他的風燭殘年而担憂。</p>
<p>各醫院　政府辦理</p>
<p>醫藥方面，一切醫院都由政府辦理，國人有病的，可以免費診治，並免費供給一切藥品。在疾病期間，由醫生出具證明書，薪水一律照領。因此，誰都不必爲疾病或是病中的生活而焦慮。</p>
<p>腰緾巨蛇嚇走選民　川西郫縣惡作劇會塲秩序大混亂</p>
<p>〔本報成都廿五日訊〕川西郫縣，因改選保長，某候選人以善弄蛇著稱，在選舉之日，恐競選失敗，遂腰纏巨蛇，外披大衣，進入選塲。殆見競選失敗形勢己定，於是忿然脫去大衣，舞動互蛇，選民四散奔走，全塲秩序大亂，選舉遂吿無形延期，此殆爲選舉中最大惡作劇。</p>
<p>社會上　男女平等</p>
<p>婦女方面，差不多百分之九十以上的婦女是出外任職的。婚姻有絕對的自由，政治上，社會上，待遇上與男子一律平等。（白拉克久克蘭小姐吿訴記者：瑞典還有極少數的塲台上，男女報酬存在不平等現象，現時全國職業婦女協會正團結力爭，深信最近即可改善），爲適應婦女工作上的便利，全國托兒所普遍林立。母親在上工前，把孩子寄到托兒所中，下工時領回。取費極低廉，而設備極為完善。國家法律之中，明文規定婦女在生產前後給予適期假日。瑞典勞工法中，還規定母親隔幾小時後，可以回家喂奶一次。所以在那裏，孩子和家庭都影響不到婦女的事業，和男子一樣，女子也能各奔前程。</p>
<p>瑞典和新西蘭都沒有佣人，一切都由自己操作。裴琴小姐說：「我們不需要呀，燒飯有煤氣，洗衣有機器，工作時間很短，大家都有充分時間可以料理家庭瑣事」。</p>
<p>廢死刑　廣施感化</p>
<p>記者還記得白拉格久克林小姐特別告訴我，在瑞典是沒有死刑的，罪犯都施以感化敎育。她說：「我們國內大多數人民是基督徒，大家相信世界上每個人都能獲得新生」。</p>
<p>當時，我曾不自主地點了點頭，週身彷彿溫暖起來了，我好像看見烏雲散去。金光輝煌。目前的瑞典和新西蘭，不也就可比爲孔子崇尙的大同世界。看看人家，想想自己，自然距離是遠了一點，但是它却是現實的。只要我們有這個信念，並決心付任何代價。（特派記者洪絮才）</p>
<h3>熱河魚鱗石</h3>
<p>（中央社熱河廿八日訊〕熱河魚鱗石產地，有兩處：一在朝陽縣屬新黃地一帶，一在凌源縣北王家店，新黃地所產多爲羣集形，形似多魚攅聚，惜石質不甚堅固，幾可層層剝落，凌源縣出品則為個體形。記者曾在此間貨攤上獲見其一，宛如活魚，當地人稱另有一種魚鱗石，魚包石內，而石質透明，望之一如游泳水中，至為生動。</p>
<p>「九一八」後，日人侵入熱河，即在凌源朝陽大量發掘，並派遺地質歷史及考古專家多人來此，實地考察，將採掘之魚鱗石運送本國，推爲三百萬年以前之遺蹟。今日熱河發現的魚鱗石，無疑的就是古時被　沒的魚，經過若干年代而化成者。</p>

<h3>優遊的剎那　世界女靑年代表大會閉幕聲中　在杭州西泠飯店內外自由活動</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿八日訊〕太陽在城頭上爬起，西湖還在迷霧之中，西泠飯店已開始騷動了　來自世界各地的二十三個國家代表，忙着梳刷。盥洗。沐浴……八時正，鈴聲響了，豐美的早餐已經預備好，大家都在餐堂間集齊，吃完了，馬上得趕往外賓招待所開會，時間眞匆促啊，大家都是那樣急急忙忙的。</p>
<p>會議從九點鐘起，一直要到十二時才完，其中只許有一刻鐘休息，正好够喝一杯茶。代表中年紀較輕的，望望會塲外滿園秋色，照耀在陽光裏，顯然有點關不住了。好容易鈴聲又起了，散會啦，可惜肚子也早在唱空城計了。於是，一輛客車，把她們重又載回西泠。　吃飯的時候，每每總是事務報吿的最好機會，譬如，下午會議改在什麽地方舉行，主席在飯後要找那幾國代表談談等類，可是今天主席忽然大發慈悲了，她宣佈說：「下午自由活動」。唔！哈！滿塲都是歡呼聲。</p>
<p>飯後，代表們分成幾組遊覽，喜歡進湖的，逕自坐船去了。另外一隊，向虎跑，六和塔，九溪十八　及之江大學出發。芬蘭代表最愛發問：「什麼叫做六和」？「六和就是東南西北天地」。「爲什麼稱和呢」？……誰都難以爲答了。</p>
<p>一到廟宇，印度代表便是最好的響導，她會吿訴你，這尊佛叫什麼名字，在印度是怎樣設計的，及印度廟宇的構圖色澤和中國有什麼不同之類。</p>
<p>每逢爬山，德國代表便最感困難，因爲她氣喘多咳，常常落後。瑞典的代表便處處照顧她，兩人非常親熟。</p>
<p>朝鮮代表是最受歡迎的，之江大學，弘道女中都來邀請。她們說：「我們寗可犧牲遊覽的時間，願意和中國學生多接觸。」於是一個去演講，一個任翻譯，另一個表演歌唱。</p>
<p>當太陽在北高峯沉落後，大家又重在西泠餐室集合，飯際互相交換半日來遊覽的經過，歡欣熱烈。但是晚飯後，大家還須帶着疲勞的身子去開會呢</p>
<p>夜晚十時，大家自會場歸來，各自到房間中安息，這才是她們整理瑣碎細事的時候。德國代表正念着在挨餓中的朋友，主席在安排明日大會的議程，中國代表正籌劃着招待事宜，而墨西哥少女，正在月亮底下，細讀情書，她說：杭州眞是度蜜月最理想的地方，她將去信向她的情人建議呢！</p>
<p>十四天了，這些代表生活在杭州西泠飯店，誰都感到優關美麗。如今世界女靑年會閉幕了，大家即將散去。許多人願意到南京去，因爲她們說：「難得有機會來到中國，一定要去看看首都。」也有許多人打算到北平去，因爲它的偉麗是聞名全球的。更有許多人必須回到祖國去。不過，不論到世界任何角落，她們將永遠不忘記爲世界的統一和平而祈禱。（特派記者洪絮才）</p>

<p>基督教衛理公會華西區會督陳文淵博土，本年五月間出國代表我國敎會，在美加等國，參加各項國際某督敎集會，已於廿七日下午四時乘馬令斯無洛號輪抵埠，記者昨趨訪陳博士，據談渠六月間在舊金山參加國際扶輪社會議，出席世界各國代表一萬五千人，爲歷來國際間最大宗敎集會，七月在加拿大國際宣敎會議任副主席，討論基督敎敎育問題，出席代表約四十餘國，其後復在美參加國際衛理會。渠本人並作有關中國問題演講，美各界人士對中國現狀皆頗關切，九月問美華盛頓大學並以榮　博士學位贈陳氏，藉表對中國崇敬之意。過去美人受國內共黨宣傳影響，對中國政府及國情觀感極壞，現美國民對左派份子已有新的估計及認識，從而對中國問題亦重予重視。渠個人在美爲衛理會主辦重慶黃山遺族學校募款，即募得美金約十萬元。該校並蒙蔣主席及婦女指導委員會捐款達六萬萬元，年底可望成立。其他美國民爲校方捐助物資亦極多，凡此種種，俱見美人對中國之熱心。陳博士今次來滬，係爲參加廿九日上海召開之基督敎敎育全國大會，將於下月初去禍州主持衛理會百週紀念大會。</p>

<h3>馬華足球隊過去和現在　一去實力可怕的勁旅</h3>
<p>〔本報專稿〕馬來亞聯華足球隊定期下月中旬征滬，客歲「星東」來滬的盛况將再見。這裏，且把馬來亞足球的史實，作一簡略叙述。</p>
<p>埠際大賽</p>
<p>原來馬來亞分爲星加坡·柔佛·森美蘭·馬六甲·雪蘭峨。檳城·霹　·吉礁等埠市。遠在一九一二年－民國十年，那時馬來亞的足球，正在逐漸發展時期，適有英國軍艦「馬來亞」號駛到，看見這種情形，便特地獻贈大銀杯一隻，舉辦馬來亞埠際足球賽，先分南北兩部比賽，再由兩部的冠軍決奪錦標。</p>
<p>自舉辦以來，南部歷年的優勝者，幾乎全屬星加坡隊，北部却由雪關峨·霹　·檳城等隊爭取決賽權。這個一年一度的埠際賽，從未中輟，直至英日宣戰，才吿停止，其間英駐軍也大都加入比賽。馬來亞足球的水準，遂無形提高，實在應讀歸功於這短短二十年來的努力提倡。</p>
<p>參加全運</p>
<p>上海球迷　「馬華」兩個字該感覺陌生，因爲民國二十四年十月舉行的第六屆全國運動會，馬來亞華僑會組隊返國參加，加人的項目包括田徑和球隊，而以足球的戰蹟最輝煌。</p>
<p>當時的足球賽，係採淘汰制，初賽馬華以九比二克遼寗，次賽又以十二比〇勝浙江，半　賽中，　以五比〇擊敗實力雄厚的河北隊，躋登四强地位。</p>
<p>那一年的足球冠軍被香港隊所獲，但是馬華與港隊實力不分上下，互奪決賽權，馬華在上半時尙以二比一佔先，結果二比二，香港隊僅勝一球。馬華隊復以三比一克上海隊，又因廣東隊的棄權，列爲亞軍。當時的陣綫是：</p>
<p>冠軍：香港隊　　包家平　余慶元　梁現贊　李國威　黃美順　梁榮照　鄭季良　李碩友　黎兆榮　曹桂成</p>
<p>亞軍：馬華</p>
<p>黃錦柏　蔡文禮　甄岸　　林志泉　簡德輝　林西扶　杜亞池　關信德　調慶福　姚勝連　尹金振</p>
<p>馬華實力</p>
<p>馬華的實力，一經揭　，馬來亞便成為足球界　目的地方。「南華」和「東方」隊，屢次出征馬來亞，無論軍容如何整齊，却依然無法獲得全勝，以民國三十年五月中旬，「南華」遠征馬來亞的二次爲例，雖擁有李惠堂·許一竟成·鍾勇森·劉松生·李碩友一·鄒文治·李國威·劉慶才等，一但在全部十七場比賽中，計勝十二塲，負兩塲，和三塲，巳經算一是歷來出征當中最滿意的成績。　今年「星島」隊征英，離港之初，屢戰屢勝，意熊非常，不料在星加坡遭遇馬華隊，受了迎頭的一棒，以一比三敗下陣來。「南華」和上海東靑聯隊，先後出國，也被該隊所挫。（一比〇勝東靑聯，二比〇勝南華）。</p>
<p>從遠近的史實來看，在上述的環境之下，馬來亞足球的實力，無論新陳代謝，始終保持在極高的水準綫上。這二次集全馬來亞各埠華僑足球選手的精說，組成勁旅來滬挑戰，據悉攻力守力，都非常强銳，兩後衛陳家壽，家萬兄弟，防守宛如鐵壁，前鋒卓振玉，謝文良爲星加坡埠際代表。倘若不受天時影響（馬華隊員畏寒），造成超逾去年「星東」的戰蹟，並非不可能。附錄馬華隊陣容如下：</p>
<p>朱志誠　陳家萬　陳家壽　施金海　李裕有　楊家宗　棄淸榮　謝文良　梅源華　卓振玉　黃籍漢</p>
<h3>接收市體育塲昨作初步磋商　體育館游泳池將先行接收</h3>
<p>江灣市立體育塲接收人員，經敎育局派定蔣塲長洲靑，工務局派定汪處長定曾後，即於昨日下午三時，偕同工程師徐科長禮，前往工灣作接收之初步之　，結果不似想像中之困難，開市體育館，市游泳池，及大講堂州可先接收，市運動塲亦可逐步接收，一俟市府向港；司令部復文後，即可正式辦理交接手續，體育塲職工亦將同時進駐塲內辦公。至修理工程，則悉由公務局負　辦理，據悉國防部賠償之修理物資，工務局已派員於前日晋京　領中，不足之數，將呈請市府另行設法，汪處長蔣塲長昨由江灣歸來後，對接收工作，均表示相常樂觀，唯彼等希望市立體育專科學校，能於正式交接時，即行遷入，則將大有利於保管及修理。</p>

<h3>財次徐柏園談　五萬元大鈔絕無其事　改幣制尙非其時　金融機構必須逐步簡化</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部次長徐柏　，日前自京扺滬，昨在中央銀行接見記者，敍述新銀行法頒行後之種切甚詳，據談：新銀行法頒行後，應注意之問題有三：　新銀行法頒行前不適合之關係法令，在陸續檢計後應予分別公吿廢止。　根據新銀行法規定’京滬兩地及全國各金融機構之檢査事宜，應硏究如何繼續辦理。　根據新銀行法規定，今後新銀行之條件，以及現有銀行之如何加强健全化，亦待硏究。以上三點，財部刻正從詳硏究中，俾便擬具妥善週密之辦法。惟據徐　個人就國際國內經濟政治趨勢觀測，今後之金融機構，必逐步趨向簡化之途。晚近英法俄澳等國銀行，已逐漸國有制度化。故相信我國將來對新設銀行之限制，必相當嚴格。關於省市縣地方銀行設置之對策，大致將根據經濟改革方案辦理。關於外傳我國將推行銀質　幣一事，渠亦以個人立塲表示，此尙不失爲改革幣制一種經濟方式。惟此事非至國內經濟情况穩定，財致收支平衡時，似不適宜。又各方盛傳五萬元大鈔，已在各農產區流通一說，徐氏斬釘截鐵否認，並稱五萬元大鈔，從未印過。對外匯平衡基金委會，自成立迄今之收支情形，渠認爲甚合理想。至四聯總處目前審核貸款原則，仍以與國計，民生，外銷有關之三方面為準繩。該處核貸之款額，總數迄已達二萬八千餘億元云。</p>
<h3>了結交易居多華股動盪不定</h3>
<p>華股昨不景氣氛更重，交易少得可憐，市况在了結狀態中，難得寸進，惟爲事實上之需要，遞交證金之亟須减低，傳說極有可能。低後業中大戶，買氣較　，疲後亦易回頭，於是市價在不定狀態中，屢有小盤頭。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>不脫疲境，永紗自即交二八八元，遞交二九二元，開後不久，回低至即交二八六元，遞交二八八元低價。十時半，息價升爲一角八及二角二分半，勢轉掙扎，再見低落至二八六元及二八八元。銀根見鬆，並盛傳證金可能見减之說，人心尙定，回升至二九四元及二九六元，午收爲二九〇元及二九四元。除成交有限之大通水泥所跌較多外，餘者十分平靜，結果較前收即交股計新光統益麗安信誼尙平，大通水泥跌半成，永紗閘北信和美亞中絲榮　華新恒豐商務華盟火柴景綸景福勤興中法新華微挫，中紡新亞內衣小升。遞交股除華豐新光見平外餘均微挫</p>
<p>後市開出微穩，永紗見二九一元及二九五元後，交易更淸。五和掛低至跌停板，永紗退至即交二八六元及遞交二八七元低價。國行交換差進不少，證金减爲三成之流言又起，臨收前會回好至二九四元及二九八元高似，而後以二九四元及二九七元之價收市。新亞在混亂中曾喊高至漲停板，內衣亦躍起甚多，國貨成交少，反以低價成交。結果較晟收即交股計五和跌停，新亞漲停後有回，軋升半成，國貨跌而內衣漲，各計一成强。永紗閘北華新恒　榮豐信和統益美亞中絲華豐火柴景綸水泥勤興中法新華微升，麗安平平。商務新光景福信誼微降。遞交股計新光美亞平平，永紗信和小升，勤興景福微升，塲外各老股銀行股仍悄，再好半成，餘者不過平平而已。</p>
<h3>統債劇瀉外股上升</h3>
<p>公債昨多頭放手，一切希望又歸冷淡，大漲之後，反動慘瀉。統丙展開二八〇〇〇元，自二八二〇〇元起，每况愈下，退至二二六〇〇元左右而後始定。洋行帮及五四三室脫手，五五〇室進後亦出，僅大成與略進，成交不過一千萬。結果較前收計統丙慘跌六五〇〇元，甲乙丁各降五千左右，統戊回低四千元。　外股昨又回上，洋商雖售，錢兌帮及證券帮又來吸納，港申常回縮少許，銀根稍鬆，怡紗自一八六〇〇〇元，步升至二〇〇〇〇〇元外收市。結果較前收計怡紗英聯電車漲起半成，會德　昂一成，怡啤墾植平平，航業鋼業電話祥泰紙業業廣微升。</p>
<h3>食米一路下跌　油市再見挫落</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬四千九百餘石，南路早薄稻到源踵接，市銷呆滯，粳米續跌二三萬元，客秈再低一二萬元。白元步削二三萬元，陰元繼續狂落三四萬元。早薄稻中次猛瀉五萬元，杜秈羊秈跟跌三四萬元，晚禾登塲期間，後形仍看下游。</p>
<p>麩皮鄕銷淸懈，狂跌萬元，麵粉人心不振，步跌萬元。收市店方乘巧納取，似乎見挺。豆餅油頭停辦，猛落萬元。黃豆油廠揀低收購，木街殺短略動，客帮微有成交，但各物供下，隨之回跌萬元。</p>
<p>菉豆南洋略動，價形平定。赤豆到銷兩細，價無波動。莞豆消化平淡，平疲之局，缸豆汕頭納胃冷懈，市勢不振，蠶豆另化有動，依然平庸。</p>
<p>紅糧苦無受主，落萬元。苞米靑島去胃平淡，形趨軟化，挫跌萬餘元。芝蔴油廠看望，本街猛殺之下，續見猛挫三四萬元。生仁廣帮突然採辦，疲而復挺，回漲五六萬元。油市逐步下瀉，生豆油再跌三五萬元，菜油淸油　落十萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：據米業界云：米市連日暴跌，本市糧情似見好轉，而對於農村出其耕耘所有，貶値求銷，換購日用需物，因日用物品之求見低落，出入互比，實使農村經濟愈吿貧困。荀此長趨疲，形成倒掛，販商經營不易，難免到源阻乏云云。</p>
<h3>廣州米價步漲</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿八日電〕廣州米價連日受金融漲風刺激，有增無已。廿八日上米每担已突破五十萬元大關，仍有續升之勢。又粵海關頃下令，嚴禁旅客携帶法幣赴台灣。</p>
<h3>外銷茶交易少</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，交易凋零，市面暫時恐難明朗。內銷花色，本街店莊蘇錫及近郊各地之走銷，迄未休止，市上買氣猶盛。惟做開數量不豐。潛勢則仍鋒銳異常</p>
<p>茶商希望陳茶易貨</p>
<p>又訊；聞茶商及輸管會推廣處等，認中信局收購之三十五年度陳茶，應暫緩拍賣。茶商並認爲應以所有之陳茶，輸往蘇聯易貨爲宜。同時更希望中信局設法將三十六年度新茶，亦輸蘇易貨。</p>
<h3>進出口商意見　輸管在考慮中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口商業等十六公會，前爲無許可證自備外匯到埠貨物之處理辦法，曾集議改進意見八點，貢獻輸管會採納。茲據輸管會　主委張嘉　表示：輸管會對該項意見，一二日內將決定辦法公佈云。</p>
<h3>無綫電用器材　改列附表三（甲）</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會刻奉行政院批准，對國內不能製造及製造不良之無綫電器材，准予自附表三乙改列表三甲，准許輸入。該項器材稅則列號爲二七一A　　　云。</p>
<h3>浮多爭相吐售　紗布均見下游</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，本客兩帮納意均懈，惟由途染織廠稍有零星搜吸，市吿挺秀。卒以新買活動者少，且有浮多吐售，收市跌過於漲。最後四二支藍鳳紗做三千三百六十萬，比上日回瀉三十萬元。其他各支粗紗，互有二三十萬升沉。</p>
<p>又訊：棉布市勢，因市　籌碼充斥，去路閑散，浮戶多頭爭吐，做價絕少振奮。最後十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，比上日續跌自萬至三萬元。　嘰元直貢下挫二萬至七萬五千之鉅，惟一九〇桃花女士林布及白貓花布，價仍挺秀數萬元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售三四三〇疋，申購單共二四張，內廠商七張，購布二三六〇疋，布號一七張，購布一〇七〇疋。</p>
<p>現棉平定</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况平穩，交易中庸，趨勢似在盤旋，紗廠進意觀望，同業尙有做開，價格無甚上落。昨日成交一〇五〇包，又一百担，棧交價做開電寳三六五萬至三七八萬。</p>
<p>紡聯召開理事會議</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國紡聯會定今日下午四時，在該會地豐路新會址，召開理事會議，屆時將根據六區棉紡公會之建議，對棉紗聯合配銷制，提出交換意見云。</p>
<p>又農林部棉業基金保管委會，亦定今日下午二時，假銀行俱樂部召開委員會議，商討基金保管事宜，及發展棉業計劃。</p>
<p>南運紗布下月停辦</p>
<p>據悉：自全經會公佈棉紗聯合配銷綱要後，其實施細則，業經紡調會擬就，聞週內即將開始辦理，同時南運紗布亦將於本月底截止審核，繼北運紗布而停止辦理云。</p>
<h3>草帽原料輸入可以申借外匯</h3>
<p>輸出入管理委員會爲鼓勵外銷，爭取外匯計，對原擬「出口貨製造之原料輸入辦法」加以修正，呈政院核示，並爲爭取外銷季節性及顧全手工藝從業員之生計，將該新辦法提前實施，此案已在上週六該會舉行大會時正式通過。茲悉該會現已先向手工藝草帽輸出同業工業公會試辦，舉辦各會員廠登記，開始迄今，已向輸出推廣處申請者，約四十餘家。其原料爲蔴草金絲草兩種，此種手工藝其出品換取之外匯，往往超過成本多多，若以原料合計三十萬美元，則製成品之代價，可値一百萬美元之多。再金絲草利潤爲三倍，蔴草則爲六倍，該會爲防止商人取巧計，凡申請外匯者，一律須具銀行担保，即所得外匯之原料，必須按照比例，交付製成品若干，並須於成品輸出後，將全部外匯交納國庫。茲悉該公會對具保一節，表示異議。廿八日已派員接洽，該會並未接受此項要求。又悉該項規定原爲附表三（甲）屬於非限額輸入審核處，値外匯有限，有關當局乃先指撥抵充云。</p>
<h3>銀根微緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市銀根，穩中微帶緊意，暗息略升，喊一角九分，華股塲外多方貼息二角一分半。行局差入達七七八億元，內中央出七四億元，大交換出一三四億元，外商入一九〇億元，小交換出八三四億元，中國入九一九億元，其他行局出人平穩。</p>
<p>行總美棉週一配發</p>
<p>行總美棉二十萬包，分配各廠易紗合約，業經上週簽訂竣事，其分配數量，全係根據外棉核配委員會所訂之分配量，近正開始整理分類，決定下週一起配發。</p>
<h3>人造絲下降　廠經綢貨續疲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市頗形平穩，一二〇號旭字一A有光，上午最大價爲七千九百萬元，旋又退落五十萬元，迄中午做八百萬元收盤。下午毫無異動，最後仍喊八百萬元賣出價，較上日軋知一百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市上午減價與上日相仿，下午成交價比上日均降二百萬元之譜。中級另担做六千萬至六千一百萬元，高另担做六千二百萬元，且俱有五天至七天期頭。干經喊價，昨亦低落二百萬元。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市開　即挫，大誠與華強眞絲被面最小降至二千二百三十萬元，下午行情比上午又小去三十萬元。</p>
<p>合格春絲收購數目</p>
<p>據中農行方面消息：各地絲廠解繳春絲，截至前日止，已經檢驗合格，送中信局收購者，共計三千五百七十七担。解送該行者，約共六千餘担</p>
<p>分配人絲標準已定</p>
<p>又訊：中信局對人造絲分配問題，決定根據各業織機台數，求得各地配額。上海因環境特殊，故需要量稍多，分配標準爲絲織業方面分配比例，上海佔百分之六十五，外埠佔百分之三五。以織機台數備，上海六。八〇〇台，分配額假定每月以七千箱爲標準，則上海可配四。五五〇箱。織帶業方面分配額，假定每月五八〇箱，上海可配五〇〇箱。</p>
<h3>商業簡報</h3>
<p>中央銀行貼放委員會昨開廿九次例會，通過申請案廿四件，計總額七十四億二千萬元。</p>
<p>國藥上週曾一度猛升，奈因去化不暢，旋復轉平，近更趨疲。冬季營業，難以樂觀。</p>
<p>捲烟昨賣氣甚遞，十支大英牌每箱比上日再跌五十萬元，老刀牌亦小六十七萬元。</p>

<h3>自由談兩種文人——試論金聖歎與周作人</h3>
<p>— 影郁</p>
<p>有兩種瞧不起文人，不願做文人，到頭來終於仍做了文人的人，其一是金聖歎之流，其一是周作人之流。在品格上說，前者遠比後者爲高；就風度而論，前者更非後者所能企及；但奇怪的是：兩者都深悔自己是文人。</p>
<p>同樣的是「悔」，本質上固大有不同。</p>
<p>誠然，金聖歎是個文人，他也處處挖苦並輕蔑專會帮忙或帮閒的文人，「越是讀書人，越把讀書人痛惡，」（批水滸傳三十二回）他所憎惡的只是文人中之一部分，正因爲他自己最有至性，所以他才不滿於當時臣服於滿人的渾渾噩噩之徒。他之輕蔑當時的帮閒文人，決非「文人相輕」的本色，而是領悟了那時代，那環境中的文人的阿諛求寵姿態後，於是不免有點噁心。他的盛贊水滸，加以批註，稱之爲「第六才子書」，他必須從這種心境去理解——「禮失而求諸野」。是的，金聖歎到後來終於不得不披上「佯狂」的外衣，從事於批註不爲當時宗法社會所容的才子書的工作了。按諸實際，金聖歎的蔑視文人，倒正由於他太理解知識份子的弱點，因之對文人有過甚的苛求之故。他討厭應聲蟲之流的奴才，却希望看到幾個封建王朝中的叛臣逆子，最後，他終於失望了。</p>
<p>然則周作人之「悔爲文人」又是怎麽一回事呢？</p>
<p>不久前南京某報記者去老虎橋邊探了一次監，歸後就寫了一篇「監中探奸記」，其中對周作人有如下的報導：</p>
<p>「周作人出身苦雨齋，一向生活並不優裕，不過嗜好一杯苦茶罷了。他在獄中的初期，替人寫對聯寫扇面很多，藉此發洩些胸中的牢騷。最近一個月，他的性情也變了，不時抱怨自己多認識幾個字，幾乎苦了一世，要是不出文名，也就沒有人拖他下水了。做個沒道理的僞敎育督辦，享受不到什麽，到如今只落得苦中加苦。」</p>
<p>周作人之深悔識得幾個字，倒不是入獄以後才悟得的「哲理」，遠在十多年前，他就有了相似的看法，原因是他將自己作爲文人中的典型人物看，雖然標榜着閒適，性靈，超脫，可是他還有點自知之明，知道要自己做個標準奴才，是不够格的，因爲在識得幾個字後，有許多地方就不能做得過分赤裸裸，歷史上的機奸如劉瑾。魏忠賢之流，均非文人出身，文人出身的崔呈秀，也不過是次等奴才而已。他並不十分懊悔於自己的做了僞敎育督辦，最使他難受的到是當年在「任」時他「享受不到什麼」，假如職位肥一點，油水多一點，則他就該以自己的「多認識幾個字」爲大幸了吧？</p>
<p>同是文人，有文天祥，也有秦　；有史可法，也有阮大　，多識得幾個字，固然有了被拖下水的資格，但也得看你自己有無定見的。周作人之才不足與阮大　比擬，影響自亦不及，看來只是明末的項水心之流耳，與金聖歎更有害壤之別。金聖歎因領導反貪汚運動而陷入淸廷的法網，在周作人眼里，眞是傻子的行徑了，雖然他自己的貪小失大，倒是更不聰明的。</p>
<h3>寄失嫁女</h3>
<p>— 志新</p>
<p>日前在一個集會中，遇見了許多幾年前同年畢業的同學，相敍之下，不免互相感慨一番。追憶學生時代的快樂，而今每人都在爲生活奔波，當年風采，已悄然逝去，尤其令人感慨的，是相問之下，連我自己在內，十個中有八九個是仍未結婚，而已結婚的，是早在學校中時已結婚的了。現在我們都已是年近三十的靑年，照理可以結婚了，尤其是幾位女同學，已屆年華將去之期，我亦不敢直接去問，但探詢之下，亦都還是獨處無郞，我們相顧都不禁黯然。由我們硏究所得，失嫁女的嚴重性，實較我們爲大。因爲我們再等幾年，到三十多歲結婚，亦未爲太晚，然而小姐們到三十多歲初嫁，實難免有「珠黃」之感了。然而造成這現象的，細細研究，主要還是她們自己，姑且聽我道來：</p>
<p>眼前在離　學校後，有一點辦法能找到一個職業的，家裏總還不錯，然而現在個人區區的收入，只能將就一個人的生活，要這種人慘淡經營來辦婚事，似乎覺得不値得一爲，而即使娶一個小康家庭之女，亦勢將力不勝任，所以許多人乾脆不結婚，單身享幾年福，將來有了辦法再談，因此就少了一批人結婚。</p>
<p>還有一輩人，却是很有意思結婚，因爲家庭中需要一個內助，草率一點倒無所謂，而對像不成問題，就可惜沒有固定的收入，因爲家庭環境較差，讀書未成，文憑和八行書都沒有，要謀一件事，實在不易，然而同樣一個女性，粗通文墨，要找事做就容易得多。試看今日任何機關，公司，行莊裏，女職員常佔到半數，在這種情形之下，難免有許多資歷較差的男子要失業，同時亦就剝奪了他們結婚的資格，失嫁女亦就一年一年的增加。</p>
<p>當今所謂時代的女性，自負非常，苟能謀得一職，便高唱自立，自給，失去了女性內助的美德，不覺金錢來處之不易，造成揮霍習慣。收入略差之男性，即不　一顧，因此自問阮　羞　的人，便無問津的勇氣。這又不知躭誤了多少小姐們的靑春！</p>
<p>筆者思想一點不頑固，並無男女偏見，縱觀上述婚姻和事業孰重，試問諸位，願失業呢，還是失嫁？如果您們尙認爲結婚比職業更可靠，那你們就該辭了職回家去，準備做新娘。</p>
<h3>動物界的求愛</h3>
<p>— 林林</p>
<p>硏究自然學的人，對於動物的求愛，一定會感覺到非常興趣。是的，動物求愛的形形式式，實在太人情化啊。這裏所寫的一些動物求愛的鏡頭，祗是動物界的一部份，但已够我們感到趣味盎然了。</p>
<p>動物界求愛的人情化，幾種鳥類可以代表之。比方流蘇鷸，是一夫多妻主義者；白鴿是採取的一夫一妻制；麻雀是多情公子；鷺鶿是硬派英雄；雄松鷄不惜卑躬屈膝地求愛；雄吐綬鷄不是講究外表的；黃鶯以歌喉來取悅異性；孔雀以炫耀美麗而追求愛人……戀愛的花樣，不一而足。</p>
<p>小麻雀求婚的時候，張開尾巴，埀下翅膀，而忽左忽右忽前忽後地跳躍着；同時又張大喉嚨大唱求婚由。十足地表現牠的股懃，忍耐和獻媚。</p>
<p>和小麻雀恰恰相反的是　鶿，因爲牠太有骨氣了；牠在雌鳥的面前，祇是踱來踱去，迎頭都不回顧；牠的矜持驕傲的態度，表示牠確確實實不是以美麗，嫵媚，或雄偉去逗誘愛人。</p>
<p>雄孔雀的尾巴是最美麗的，而牠亦就憑着牠那美麗的尾巴去求愛。孔雀的翅膀，羽毛的顏色暗淡，不大好看，所以在牠求愛便時將尾巴展開來掩蔽醜陋的翅膀。另外有一種呌做靑鸞的鳥，亦是以美麗的尾巴來求愛的。</p>
<p>雄吐綬的鷄又恰恰的孔雀與靑鸞相反，不是以美麗取悅於異性的。因爲牠在求婚時，牠的肉垂便特別腫大，作鮮紅色，以審美的眼光看，當然是很不美麗的。</p>
<p>最要不得的算是雄松鷄了。雄松鷄自恃天生一副好皮相，平時裝出一種不可一世的臭架子，但到了求愛時，牠固然在雌鳥面前大爲表演一番，是後就表出搖尾乞憐的醜態，因爲牠全身一伏，頭頸觸着地面，好像跪下來一樣。</p>
<p>流蘇鷸是英雄主義的信徒，因爲牠用角鬥來爭取美人的歡心。</p>
<p>雄蜂鳥向異性求愛時，差不多是一種純粹詩意的動作。最初，牠圍繞着她，像一隻鐘擺的擺動，作半弧形的飛行，繼而特別富於深情似的，將弧形的兩端升高；然而，突然的，又垂直地向上一衝，約有六十呎；最後又突然地一跌下來，停在空中，而在她的面前所顯示的，好像一隻發光的鑽石一樣。</p>
<p>澳洲有一種呌做園丁鳥，牠的求愛資本是建築一座漂亮的巢，這個巢以石頭草莖作原料，再以各種顏色的羽毛來裝飾。求愛時便站在門前，口含着漂亮的石頭，以引誘雌烏。</p>
<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國小姐的文藝修養</p>
<p>美國人是生成一種愛好文藝的民族，中國本來是世界最古的文教之邦，現在風氣不變，中國正在用兵之秋，殺人盈野，流血漂杵，而美國人反而在偃武修文，尤其是女子，對於文藝都有修養，這固然有力於普及敎育居多，但也是國家昇平，民生富裕，才有閑工夫致力於詩歌文詞音樂圖書，美國女子每日化若干小時在謀生工作，其餘的時間差不多完全用在文藝方面，她們有各種詩歌會，作者協會，音樂會，戲劇協會，美術協會，美術展覽會，她們的文藝修養是多方面的，不僅僅擅長一門而已，加入作者協會的，同時也是其他團體的會員，她們以工作及家務的餘路，從事著作，多數是寫愛情小說，光由當地報紙發表，然後由雜誌轉載，再歸書局刊印單行本，一稿三賣，收入相當客觀，頗有成名的作品，被好萊塢採爲影片劇本，例如Amber　Forever之類，單是電影版權就是五十萬美金，如果舞台上排演，每次另有版稅，出書一本，就此解決了生活，五十萬美金好好的去化，一世也化不完。美國女人多數會畫油繪，並非附庸風雅，確有相當把握。各地都有美術館陳列盡家作品，賣書之風，沒有像中國那樣營業化，美國的職業範圍很廣，還不至靠賣盡吃飯，所以美國人還不會完全把美術作品當作商品，事實上美國人差不多都能塗幾筆，她們有欣賞的趣味，却沒有收買的胃口，而且搜買盡賣從前是書畫家的作風，現在是暴發戶的慣技，美國極少暴發戶，因此畫件的銷路頗狹，她們也常常開展覽會，目的不在推廣作品，而作欣賞和比較自己及別人的作品，你在會塲中可以看到中年和老年的女人，站在每張畫的前面，一手持了單眼放大鏡，放在眼前鑒賞名畫，而作者也祗慇懃招待，並不鼓吹自己的作品，或天花亂墜的引誘人家去買她的作品。會裏備有咖啡與茶點，免費招待，不過入塲時得出錢買一本目錄，從二角五分至一元，足夠開支而有餘了，除了詩文汕畫之外，鋼琴是任何女子都能來一手的，茶餘酒後，按琴一闕，那是多麼怡和的家庭環境，音樂修養性格的良劑，許多上海的女性把整個生命寄託在華爾滋與夜光盃中，她們不但需要讀畫學詩，還得知畫知音，做一個現代女性不是單憑口紅絲襪就可算數的。</p>
<h3>紀曉嵐</h3>
<p>— 季明——淸人小傳之二</p>
<p>淸乾隆三十七年，開四庫全書館，求天下書籍，積十餘年而成，統計共三萬六千餘册，建文淵，文潮，文津，文源，（是爲內廷四閣）文匯，文宗，文瀾七閣以貯之，實爲我國學術界一大結晶，主其事者，即紀文達公是也。</p>
<p>公名昀，字曉嵐，一字春帆，河間人，少奇　，讀書目數行下，夜坐暗室，目閃閃如電，不燭能見物。比知識大開，光亦歛矣。乾隆田戌，舉進士，平生爲總憲者五，長禮部者三，嘉慶十年，拜協辦大學士，加太子少保，是年二月，卒，年八十有二。</p>
<p>公於盡無所不通，尤精漢易，一生精力，備注於四庫提要及目錄，不復自爲撰著，然間有小說稗宮之作，如閱微草堂筆記是也。性好滑稽，類東方曼情者流，嘗署日値翰林院，忽報帝微服至，羣僚皆正襟危坐，公以赤膊故不敢見，避匿床下，移時，室內寂然，公乃探首外望，見一人背坐窗間，翻閱案牘，心以爲同僚也，遽問曰：「老頭子去乎？」其人怫然作色，命之出，則帝躬也，公大慌恐，叩頭請死，帝責日：「翰林赤膊，已違朝命，矧背後呼君爲「老頭子」，該當何罪？」公叩頭日：「老者，天下之大老也，頭爲人身之元，子乃男子之美稱，合而言之，均頌詞也，臣知罪矣，請死。」帝旋罰令作急就章一篇，文成，帝悅而恕之。公平生事多類此，蓋文人負才，每有不嚴之行，如公者，其庶幾乎？</p>
<h3>第一個漢奸</h3>
<p>在歷史上，第一個漢奸當推曹無傷，他是沛公的左司馬，當沛公在壩上時，曹使人通項王曰：「沛公欲王關中，使子嬰爲相，珍寳盡有之。」因此，沛公項王遂有鴻門之宴的一幕。</p>
<p>然而，這位漢奸的祖宗，沒有和現在的漢奸那樣幸運。沛公在項王處得悉此事，至軍，立刻把他殺死了李仁衆</p>
<h3>飲酒的語言</h3>
<p>— 思果</p>
<p>在一次宴會上，我會經說我不會喝酒，要喝只能小半杯。誰知我的話被主人解爲我很能喝酒，即使我沒有豪量。那晚我再主人　　的強勸之下便喝醉了。這事却不足怪，我所以爲怪的是我的說話何以引起主人的誤解來。</p>
<p>經過那次醉酒我便謹愼了，我每逢宴會便吿訴主人我有胃病不能飲酒是醫生關照了的。而且爲了使主任相信，我告訴他即使飲了一滴胃也要發痛，這是句謊話，按着公民的課本是不該說的，但這話在握的號主人聽來就是我的實情。「這傢伙吃半杯美關係，不勉强他也罷了。」我於是連答禮帶表示敬意就喝個半杯了事。我出外作事有時討厭別人說謊，因了此事我便害怕錯怪了人；也許說謊者也有不得已的苦衷呢。</p>
<p>參加宴會多了，慢慢發現飲酒的言語正是國語的一支，大有道理的。主人說沒有菜就不是實話；他也許暗示有兩樣菜是特製的，城裏沒有第二家有，但等你誇讚一陣（也許是實也許不是實）他却堅決地說菜做得不好了。客了中酒量豪的不便暢飲便說一句，我今天借花獻佛代主人打個通關，道樣他如果輸了便可如願。飲酒又最勢利，今天如果你是上客，你的量也好，人家才敬你勸你。你如果是陪陪客或是身份不顯，有量也喝不了多少酒，除非有個大人物找你做「食庫」，那你就有機會像小丑似的一杯一杯灌進口去，說不定還得到稱讚</p>
<p>有一種人是做買賣出身，酒少話多。他能說會笑，聲音洪亮，蠻不講理或只講蠻理。不喝酒乾脆沒有發言權冰冷地坐在旁邊，但會說的根本也無須喝多少。他可以喊你做老弟擺出哥哥的身份，連哄帶嚇呌你喝酒。酒席上無大小，人可以不拘禮，或者呌你老伯把酒杯「跪」（就是反放着）在你面前。他可以做出可憐的樣子呌旁人救救他「下台」如果你執抝着不肯飲，遇着主人敬你，他可以說你不把面子給東家。有時引經據典，有時文武幷用，結果你必得喝酒。在這種塲合只有認輸沉默最宜。他們計較着你比他少吃了一些硬不放鬆使人懷疑喝酒究竟晨快樂還是痛苦。若說是樂，還用多費　舌；若說是苦，主任請客爲的是什麽？我想這種現象的產生完全因為中國演講機會少，所以口才好的無處顯身手。便只有求之筵席了。</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Visits Chairman at Kuling; Attends Lower House Meeting to Report Before Departure; President Chang Returns to Nanjing, to Visit Southern China Again</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Foreign Minister Wang had just returned to the capital when, at 9 a.m. on the 27th, he attended the Executive Yuan's regular meeting to report on his trip abroad and various related foreign affairs issues. The report lasted an hour and was divided into five points: the United Nations General Assembly, the Japanese Peace Treaty, the Korean Issue, the Palestine Question, and American Aid to China. Regarding the Japanese Peace Treaty, Wang stated that we must insist on two points: first, Japan must be disarmed to prevent renewed aggression, and second, we must maintain the use of veto power to protect our national interests. Wang stated: His remarks to reporters in Japan were given great importance and welcomed by both the Japanese government and the public. Regarding American aid to China, Wang stated: "From any perspective, this matter has improved." After Wang's report, several members of the Executive Yuan raised questions, which Wang answered, and discussions ensued. Wang left the meeting at 11 a.m. At 1:30 p.m., upon the summons of Chairman Chiang, he accompanied his eldest son aboard the "Tianxiong" aircraft, transiting to Kuling, to report in detail on his attendance at the Second United Nations General Assembly. He will return to Nanjing in two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Premier Chang Chun has decided to inspect Southern China again in the short term, and after a brief rest upon his return, he will visit the Northwest. It is said that Chang plans to inspect all the important economic and political urban centers nationwide to serve as a reference for the policies of his responsible cabinet.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Premier Chang Chun returned to Nanjing at 4:50 p.m. on the 28th after a four-day inspection of Taiwan. In addition to attending the Taiwan Retrocession Commemoration Celebration, he also comforted compatriots, visited industrial ports, and inspected the economic situation. During the four days, Chang visited five factories: the camphor factory, tea factory, railway machine factory, fertilizer factory, and sugar factory; and two ports: Keelung Port and the Kaohsiung Port fortress. Chang was generally satisfied with the overall situation. The two points that deserve research and improvement are education and the economy. In terms of education, under the past Japanese enslavement education, the method used for Taiwanese compatriots' education was universal primary and secondary education, while opportunities for university education were rarely given to Taiwanese. According to the information obtained, in 1944, the situation of Taiwan University education was as follows: in the Department of Literature and Politics, there were 31 Japanese students and only 4 Taiwanese students; in the Department of Science, there were 40 Japanese students and only 1 Taiwanese student; in the Department of Engineering, there were 47 Japanese students and only 2 Taiwanese students; in the Department of Agriculture, there were 74 Japanese students and no Taiwanese students. The opposite was true for the Department of Medicine, with 87 Japanese students and 104 Taiwanese students. After retrocession, the Japanese withdrew, and the schools were almost without students. This phenomenon urgently needs to be improved and supplemented. In terms of the economy, Japan has always adopted a segmented approach to Taiwan's industry, such as not allowing Taiwan to produce finished products from raw materials produced in Taiwan. However, because Taiwan was a subsidiary of Japan, its industrial economy was able to maintain close connections and cooperation with Japan. Now that retrocession has occurred, efforts should be made to coordinate with the domestic economy. For example, Taiwan Sugar should not make the domestic market its primary focus in the future but should focus on opening up overseas markets, so that the economy of Taiwan Province can be stabilized. Chang praised the stable and orderly life in Taiwan. Although the "February 28th Incident" of earlier this year is still in the memory of the Taiwanese people, Chang answered twelve inquiries from them at a provincial council banquet, stating that this was an unfortunate incident and hoped that everyone could forget it. Chang believes that primary education in Taiwan is currently very widespread, almost 85 percent, far stronger than in the mainland. Pingtung has a population of only 40,000, but there are as many as eight middle schools. From 6 a.m., the streets of Pingtung City are filled with students, which Chang greatly appreciates. Chang believes that if education and the economy can be improved, stability can be easily achieved in Taiwan Province.</p>
<h3>US Relief Supplies to China to be Shipped Within the Year; Vice Minister Xu Claims Price Increases Will Gradually Disappear</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The U.S. State Department stated that the agreement simultaneously announced in Nanjing and Washington once again demonstrates the strong feelings of friendship and sympathy between the peoples of the two countries. Under the U.S. Foreign Relief Act, totaling $350 million, China can receive approximately $30 million in relief. A spokesperson added that the exact amount of aid to China will be announced within days, at which time details of the first shipment of relief supplies will also be released. According to sources from responsible parties, the shipment of relief supplies to China can be completed within this year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan stated: "The relationship between China and the United States has always been harmonious, built on traditional friendship and sincerity, and should be maintained unceasingly. The signing of the Sino-American Relief Agreement in Nanjing further demonstrates the overflowing friendship between the two countries." Xu continued: "Although the supplies provided under the agreement are limited to food, medicines, and clothing, it should be known that food is the paramount necessity of the people. As our country is currently in a state of suppression of rebellion, the food supply is often insufficient. This aid can directly regulate supply and demand and indirectly help stabilize food prices. Furthermore, the phenomenon of general price increases in the past, which were often based on fluctuations in food prices, can also be gradually eliminated."</p>
<h3>Price of Goods Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 28th] After the announcement of the Sino-American Relief Agreement, the prices of food grains and general merchandise in Peiping have trended downward. The lowest retail price of high-quality rice has fallen to 6,000 per catty. American flour has been released onto the market, causing a significant drop in price. Declines of 30,000 to 40,000 are common. Shenghan flour has also dropped by around 10,000. Bingshun flour, the top grade, has decreased by 265,000 per bag, and Peiping flour has also declined to 275,000. Sugar and cotton yarn have also fallen slightly. Haichang blue cotton cloth has declined by 20,000, and cigarettes are also expected to fall.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yide Changes Flight to Capital to Today</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 28th] Zhou Yide was originally scheduled to fly to the capital on the 28th.

<h3>Measures for Handling Foreign Supplies Approved; Remaining Supplies to be Sold Locally for US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the handling of foreign supplies, the Executive Yuan recently approved three handling measures: 1. For remaining supplies, the portion to be shipped back to the country will still be handled according to the previous plan. Those urgently needed for national defense and transportation will be allocated at the original price. The funds for these supplies will be deducted from the original and additional budget items of the receiving agencies. However, transportation costs, miscellaneous fees, warehouse rent, and handling fees must be fully paid in cash by the receiving agencies, without exception. As for unshiped supplies, the Bureau of Materials Supply is responsible for selecting materials at the original location. Except for equipment urgently needed for national defense, all should be sold locally for U.S. dollars to generate foreign exchange income and save on transportation costs. 2. Lend-Lease supplies, except for military equipment, which should be allocated to the Ministry of National Defense to be paid for from its original budget or transferred at cost, should be sold at market prices by the Bureau of Materials Supply, regardless of whether there is an original applicant agency. If the original applicant agency wishes to use the supplies, it should also participate in the bidding and purchase them from its original budget, and should not request transfers or additional budgets. 3. For materials purchased with loans, the measures of the Executive Yuan should be strictly followed. Allocation is only permitted if the receiving agencies can deposit cash in the treasury. Otherwise, they must first contract a loan with the National Bank before allocation, without exception.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Reparations Commission has determined that the first batch of dismantled materials from Japanese reparations should be allocated according to the standard of 120,000 tons for private enterprises, as ordered. It submitted five resolutions passed by the fourth committee meeting of the commission: 1. It is determined that the principle is to allocate 120,000 tons to private enterprises. 2. A new distribution plan is formulated based on the original assumed first batch of dismantled reparations materials. 3. Materials suitable for private enterprises should be allocated to private enterprises as much as possible. 4. The materials obtained in each batch should be distributed according to the distribution plan.

It is recommended that Nai Guang, Weng Wenhao, Bai Chongxi, Yu Dawei, Chen Qitian, and Qin Fen organize a subcommittee to draft the distribution plan, convened by Gan NaiGuang. The subcommittee then convened a meeting to discuss and decide on the following distribution measures for the 9,447 machine tools obtained in the first batch by our country: A. One-quarter should be allocated to private enterprises (i.e., the Economic Affairs Department below obtains 25%), and the remaining three-quarters should be allocated according to the original application quantities of each ministry and commission. The detailed distribution measures should be determined according to the nature of the machine tools and the needs of each ministry and commission. B.

<h3>Luo Longji States in the Capital that the Democratic League Will Obey the Order to Dissolve; Zhang Lan Officially Announces Temporary Suspension of Activities of Branches in Various Locations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] After the Ministry of Interior announced that the Democratic League was an illegal organization, Luo Longji of the Democratic League immediately went to the U.S. Embassy to report the matter. In the afternoon, he also visited the Chargé d'Affaires. Huang Yanpei arrived in the capital from Shanghai in the afternoon and met with Luo at the Chargé d'Affaires' office for a long discussion. Huang also visited Shao Lizi. In the evening, Luo told reporters that they could not yet understand whether the internal announcement was the government's order, so it was necessary to continue to contact government officials and decided to visit Zhang Lisheng on the 29th to ask for an explanation. When asked what attitude the Democratic League would adopt if the announcement was an order, Luo said: "We are prepared to accept the order to dissolve." Luo also said: "I did not intend to seek protection by going to the U.S. Embassy, but since the Political Consultative Conference, American friends have participated, so I specifically informed them of this matter." It was also heard that the measures taken by the Ministry of Interior against the Democratic League would be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference for approval and then to the State Council for approval before they could be announced and implemented.

<h3>Negotiations for Sino-British Commercial Treaty; Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Inland River Navigation Rights are the Core Issues; London Denies Indefinite Postponement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Negotiations for the Sino-British Commercial Treaty, which began at the same time as the Sino-American Commercial Treaty last spring, have not achieved much in nearly two years. There has been sudden talk in the capital that the agreement is shelved, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is silent on the matter. The British side claims that the delay is due to technical issues. However, according to what our reporter has learned from sources with relevant power, each side has its own positions. Our country believes that the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue is the only remaining vestige of unequal treaties and should be completely resolved during the signing of the commercial treaty to enhance Sino-British friendship and complete the effort to abolish unequal treaties. However, the British side believes otherwise and insists on retaining this jewel in the crown as a stepping stone for developing trade with the Far East, especially China. It firmly refuses to consider the return of Hong Kong and Kowloon and even plans for long-term construction and permanent jurisdiction. What the British side insists on is to regain inland river navigation rights in China. Since the signing of the Sino-British New Treaty, Britain has abandoned this privilege. Since China reopened its ports after victory two years ago, the losses suffered by British merchants in China due to their own incompetence and poor management have made them feel regret. Therefore, they want to stage a comeback. However, our diplomatic authorities believe that the abolition of unequal treaties has been achieved after great difficulty, and we cannot make similar concessions again, which would lead to the loss of national rights and popular support. The British Parliamentary Delegation to China made exploratory talks on this demand, which has already drawn condemnation and protests from Chinese officials and public opinion. Therefore, this matter is also absolutely impossible. Due to these events and circumstances, the progress of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty negotiations has been extremely slow recently. The counter-proposals proposed by our country are still at the center of the British side's research. Progress can only be expected after their research results are returned to our country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The Sunday Observer reported that London has decided to postpone the negotiations for the Sino-British Commercial Treaty indefinitely. A spokesman for the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied this today, saying that it was inconsistent with the facts. The delay in the treaty negotiations is mainly due to: 1. The majority of British associations and small commercial groups have vested interests in this treaty and must be consulted. 2. British trade experts are currently in Geneva participating in the charter of the International Trade Organization and other matters. The spokesman also said that the Observer's claim that the resumption of treaty negotiations depends on a change in the Chinese government's attitude is absolutely untrue.</p>

<h3>United Nations Discusses the Korean Problem: US Representative States Position, Advocates Universal Suffrage Before the End of March Next Spring, US-Soviet Troops May Withdraw Only After the Establishment of a Provisional Government</h3>
<p>(Our report) New York, 28th broadcast: Lake Success dispatch, today US representative Dulles proposed a resolution in the UN Political Committee, advocating that the United Nations should find ways to hold universal elections in Korea no later than March 31st next spring, and establish a United Nations commission to supervise the elections. Once the Korean government establishes a security force, US and Soviet troops may withdraw, and this withdrawal should also be carried out under the supervision of the United Nations Commission. Mr. She believes that the US proposal, if thoroughly implemented, would benefit the thirty million people of Korea. He opposed the Soviet Union's previous proposal, which was to withdraw US and Soviet troops directly without waiting for the establishment of a Korean government, calling it impractical and ultimately unable to achieve Korean unification.</p>
<p>(United Press Lake Success, 28th) US representative Dulles is preparing to submit a detailed plan to the UN Political Committee for holding elections in Korea within five months to establish a provisional government. The main points are: The United Nations requests the US and Soviet occupation zones to hold elections separately by March 31 to establish a provisional national government. A United Nations commission will be established to monitor the voting; after Korea establishes a national defense force, the occupying forces will withdraw completely as soon as possible; if necessary, the United Nations will assist in the withdrawal of troops and the organization of discussions on Korean legislation. Mr. She also advocated that South Korea abandon universal elections and that North and South Korea vote separately. His explanation was that because the two regions have different election procedures, separate voting can be faster and more effective, and a central constitutional assembly can be established based on the election results. On this point, Mr. Dulles will state that the election methods in the two regions "cannot be completely satisfactory from the perspective of American ideals."</p>
<p>Ms. Eun Looyi, a representative of Korean political leader Syngman Rhee, calling herself the "Korean Representative to the United Nations," Ms. Eun supported the US proposal for Korea, but hoped that the United Nations would establish a monitoring mechanism with broader powers than those advocated by the United States. Ms. Gu proposed a three-point procedure: Within ninety days after the United Nations passes a resolution on Korea, a general election should be held to establish a national assembly. Fifteen days after the general election, representatives should gather in Seoul to elect a provisional government, president, cabinet, and necessary institutions. In the following ninety days, US and Soviet occupying forces should gradually withdraw. At the same time, US officials reiterated that Ms. Eun "has no legal status to serve as a representative of Korea, she represents Syngman Rhee."</p>
<h3>Three Government Parties Cooperate Closely: Cabinet Status Strengthened, Ramadier Urges National Unity to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>(Reuters Paris, 28th) The latest development in French politics is the joint statement issued by the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement, stating that they will seek closer cooperation with the left wing of the Radical Party to oppose the De Gaulle faction and the Communist Party. This declaration was issued after a meeting of representatives of the three parties today.</p>
<p>(Our report) London, 28th broadcast: Paris dispatch, the French National Assembly convened today, with emotions as tense as rarely seen in French history. Prime Minister Ramadier delivered a moving speech defending the current cabinet, rumored not to end the life of the coalition government due to the rise of the De Gaulle faction and the strike actions of the Communist Party. He believes that suppressing prices must be thoroughly implemented, so he opposes the continuous increase in wages. France is currently going through an extremely difficult period, and all parties must cooperate sincerely to overcome the difficulties. He asked the parliament to vote on the current government's vote of confidence. There was a commotion in the hall at that time, with Communist Party members and members sympathetic to the De Gaulle movement shouting loudly. Mr. Lai criticized both the Communist Party and the De Gaulle faction, but his criticisms of the Communist Party were particularly harsh.</p>
<p>(Reuters Paris, 28th) Ramadier's new cabinet attended the National Assembly for the first time today. This cabinet, composed of the Socialist Party, the People's Republican Movement, and the Radical Party, met this morning to prepare for the debate in parliament. Prime Minister Ramadier's status has been strengthened after the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement jointly stated that they would not cooperate with the Communist Party and De Gaulle. Political figures believe that if Ramadier asks the parliament for a vote of confidence, he can expect to receive majority support. People here believe that the joint declaration of the Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement is intended to prevent a cabinet crisis and give De Gaulle the opportunity to take power. It is said that the Socialist Party has asked the People's Republican Movement to help it stop the trend of "Caesarism."</p>
<p>Majority Support Can Be Obtained for a Vote of Confidence Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Reuters Paris, 28th) The French National Assembly, which reconvened today, is not expected to approve De Gaulle's request yesterday to dissolve the parliament and hold new elections. The parliament is scheduled to vote on the Ramadier government's vote of confidence on Thursday. The People's Republican Movement, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the municipal elections, is expected to follow the Socialist Party in casting a vote of confidence. At most, the Communist Party will abstain, and will never cast a negative vote, so Ramadier's vote of confidence is almost without question.</p>
<h3>Possibility of a Resurgence of Strikes in France</h3>
<p>(Reuters Paris, 27th) Political figures in Paris expect that De Gaulle's request for the immediate dissolution of the National Assembly and the holding of new elections will prompt the Communist Party to launch an offensive in the industrial sector. The railway workers' union and the civil servants' association, which has two million members, are scheduled to meet on the 27th and may decide to strike, thus bringing all railway traffic and the work of government agencies across the country to a standstill.</p>

He emphasized that if the Parliament Act is not amended, the majority of the House of Commons and Labour Party members will be manipulated by the House of Lords, which may even lead to a real constitutional crisis.</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Arrives in London for Talks with Bevin</h3>
<p>(Reuters London, 28th) Italian Foreign Minister Sforza arrived in London yesterday and met with Bevin this morning to discuss topics such as possible revisions to the peace treaty and the future of Italy's former colonies.

<h3>British Troops Stationed in Burma to be Fully Withdrawn by the End of February Next Year</h3>
<p>(Reuters Rangoon, 27th) Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu said today that the last batch of British troops stationed in Burma will be withdrawn from Burma by the end of February next year.

<h3>Reorganization of the Polish Peasant Party, Exiled Leader Arrives in Sweden</h3>
<p>(Our report) Stockholm, 28th broadcast: Warsaw dispatch, after Mikolajczyk's exile, the Supreme Committee of the Polish Peasant Party recently convened a meeting and decided that the party's left-wing leader Wincenty Witos would lead a thorough reorganization to be held on November 30, and begin to promote policies supporting the government.

"United Press Washington, 27th" A US State Department spokesperson recently stated that Polish Peasant Party leader Mikolajczyk will be allowed to enter the US for asylum if he makes such a request.</p>
<h3>Churchill Tries to Overthrow the Cabinet for the Fourth Time: Introduces a Motion of No Confidence, Conservative Party's Amendment to the King's Speech is Rejected</h3>
<p>(Our report) London, 28th broadcast: Former British Prime Minister Churchill made his fourth attempt to overthrow the Labour government today, demanding a vote of no confidence in the government. He delivered a speech in the House of Commons, saying that the Labour Party's important industrial socialistization plan has failed, leading to the weakening of Britain in a time of crisis.</p>
<p>(Our report) London, 28th broadcast: Former British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, launching a major attack on the government's lack of leadership. Prime Minister Attlee will summarize the various debates tomorrow and then vote on the motion.</p>
<p>(Our report) London, 28th broadcast: On Monday night, the British House of Commons continued to meet. Conservative MP Thomas attempted to amend the King's Speech, arguing to insert a sentence into the draft, expressing regret that the government failed to provide a "clear" plan on the issue of reducing the military. As a result, it was rejected by 252 votes to 111. Earlier, Mr. Thomas told the House of Commons that due to the government's decision to reduce naval personnel from 860,000 during the war to 147,000, the country's fleet strength would be severely affected. Naval Minister Alexander replied that this reduction would not affect the strength of the navy. In order to achieve the plan to reduce the total number of troops to 937,000 by next spring, a large reduction in naval personnel was unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Transferred to Important US Defense Post</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Washington, 27th) The Department of the Army announced today that General Wedemeyer has been appointed as the Director of Plans and Operations, a key defense post, to fill the vacancy left by Lieutenant General Norstad.

<h3>To Ensure World Peace, the United States Should Strengthen its Military Strength: Truman and Others Issue Warnings</h3>
<p>(United Press Washington, 27th) President Truman said in a speech on US Navy Day: The United States, as the leader of the world, has a responsibility "not only to establish a just and reasonable peace, but also to maintain a fully prepared military force to ensure peace." Navy Secretary Sullivan issued a warning that in the two years since the victory in the war against Japan, the number of US Navy personnel has been sharply reduced, and it is now difficult to make normal adjustments. In today's world, there are forces hostile to our government and our way of life, so we must be prepared to defend our freedom at any time when necessary. Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz warned that if the United States suddenly encounters another war, the current strength of the Navy Department will not be able to cope with its responsibilities.</p>
<p>(US Information Service Washington, 27th) Subcommittees of the House Armed Services Committee have recommended that the United States continue to provide assistance to European countries in need, while maintaining the US military strength.</p>
<h3>US Government Convenes Leaders from All Walks of Life to Exchange Views on the Aid to Europe Plan: Part of the Aid Will Be Given as Grants</h3>
<p>(United Press Washington, 27th) Secretary of State Marshall and other senior government officials convened leaders from the business community, labor community, and press community on the night of the 27th to hold a "study meeting" to discuss opinions on the foreign aid plan. Marshall, Secretary of Commerce Harriman, Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, and World Bank President McCloy delivered speeches at the meeting. It is reported that the meeting revealed that the executive authorities are considering requesting Congress to grant legislative power to restore the allocation of important materials such as steel.</p>
<p>(United Press Washington, 27th) It is reported that of the six billion yuan needed for the first year of the Marshall Plan, it is estimated that more than one-third cannot be regarded as loans and can only be used as pure grants. However, the government authorities are planning how to obtain some indirect compensation for this grant, such as making more constructive reconstruction plans to reduce the need for the United States. According to estimates by the sixteen European countries participating in the Paris Economic Conference, they will need to obtain 20.4 billion US dollars from the United States in the next four years, but the current concern of the government is the 6 billion yuan for next year. There is currently no decision on how to pay for the funds needed for the Marshall Plan, and there is even no decision on how to submit it to Congress. However, the government and most members of Congress believe that the source of funds should be: Loans from government, private, or international banks to purchase vehicles and industrial equipment; raw materials and machinery (such as agricultural machinery) should also be purchased with loans, and the Export-Import Bank will be authorized to lend; food and fuel are the most basic and most difficult items for recovery, and currently no government or intergovernmental loan organization can support them. There is no other way than for the US Congress to approve the grant.</p>
<h3>US Aid to Europe Amount Revised After Review: Harriman Mission Issues Statement</h3>
<p>"United States News Service, Washington, 27th." It is reported that the 19-member committee led by Commerce Secretary Harriman is currently studying the relationship between foreign aid and American resources and has decided to make some revisions to the estimates for aid to Europe. The Harriman Mission issued the following statement: "In recent weeks, this committee has reviewed the requests of various European countries and has had lengthy negotiations with European representatives from Washington. As a result of the review, the committee believes that the requests of some European countries should be revised. Some should be increased, but in some aspects, they should be reduced depending on whether the United States has all the requested materials. However, to date, the committee cannot determine the scope and amount of the four-year plan."</p>
<h3>US Congressional Special Session to Discuss Tax Cut Bill</h3>
<p>Taft Says Session Will Be Extended</p>
<p>[United Press, Boston, 27th] Taft declared at a press conference: "I have no knowledge of the statement that the Marshall Plan will 'take action' around December 19 before Congress recesses for Christmas. I anticipate that Congress will extend its session to discuss tax cuts and issues such as providing 4 to 5 billion US dollars in aid to Europe annually and reducing national expenditures."</p>
<h3>I Elected Vice Chairman at Asian Labor Conference</h3>

<h3>Japanese Economic Stabilization Board Criticizes Supplementary Budget</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Due to the recent supplementary budget, new rice prices, and widespread strikes, the Japanese and Socialist parties have had to consider making concessions on maintaining the current price system and the 1,800 yen basic wage. The Economic Stabilization Board has expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the supplementary budget, claiming that it is completely different from the Board's original budget intentions. It also stated that the bill is largely based on the Socialist Party's proposals, and the Yoshida Cabinet should bear considerable responsibility, and that the stability of the economy will depend on the government's political strength.</p>
<h3>Bevin Discusses Policy Toward Germany, Resolves Not to Let Germany Threaten World Security: Central Institutions Not Established, France Should Be Responsible</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 27th) Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons debate on the German question that the British government is determined to continue to prevent Germany from adopting secret policies that would allow it to establish a dictatorship that threatens world security. Regardless of the success or failure of the next Foreign Ministers' Conference, the British government's guiding principle for its policy toward Germany remains to establish constitutional institutions in Germany, continue to promote a sound system, and establish economic conditions that enable the German people to have a reasonable standard of living.</p>
<p>When referring to the difficulty of applying the principle of German economic unity, Bevin said: "We cannot entirely blame the Soviet Union either. France has expressed deep concern about the railway and other central institutions due to the influence of French law. France did not participate in the Potsdam Conference, and France's reservations have prevented the establishment of central institutions to this day. Today, Germany's economic unification has not yet been established, and the resources of the Soviet zone are still being taken as reparations, and factories are also being moved. In July of this year, we discovered in Paris that it was still difficult for the major powers to agree, and in view of the tragedy facing Germany and the occupation zones in Germany, I had to take any step to make the British occupation zone self-sufficient. Therefore, when the United States proposed merging with its occupation zone, the British government accepted it. Unexpectedly, after the merger agreement was established, the price of American wheat rose sharply, from $1.75 per bushel to $3, and the original basis of calculation was completely lost, and we could not obtain adequate food to maintain the rationing quantity. We have stated in Moscow that we cannot allow the standard of German industry to remain without an agreement for long. If other countries cannot agree, Britain and the United States will set their own standards. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is about to convene, and if the conference fails because of our insistence on this principle, it will not be our fault."</p>
<h3>British and American Governments Approve Ruhr Mine Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The British Foreign Office announced tonight that the British and American governments have approved the recommendation made by experts from both countries in Washington last month to transfer the Ruhr coal mines to German management, with a control committee jointly formed by Britain and the United States to supervise them. According to authoritative sources, the British, French, and American governments have also approved the communiqué issued by the British, American, and French representatives after coal production negotiations in Berlin.

<p>(Reuters, Tehran, 27th) It is reported that Iranian members of parliament held a secret meeting yesterday to draft a bill, preparing to submit it to parliament, instructing the Iranian government to send troops and civil officials to Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf to restore Iranian sovereignty there. (Bahrain Island is an oil-producing area, originally an independent land under Turkish control, and has a treaty relationship with Britain. Iran has repeatedly declared that the island belongs to it, but Britain has never recognized it.) Iranian newspapers report that Iranian parliamentarians also discussed reports that Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Shakirkov, is about to leave Iran during the secret meeting. Iranian newspapers also report that the Soviet Embassy has requested a copy from the Iranian Foreign Ministry of Prime Minister Sultanah's report to parliament last week on the Soviet-Iranian negotiations. It is also learned that although 25 members of the Soviet Embassy were invited to attend the celebration of the Iranian King's birthday today, only five people attended, and Shakirkov and others were not present, leading Iranians to speculate more about the next actions to be taken by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Small Assembly Case: China and France Oppose Expanding Power, Small Committee Finally Passes US Proposal</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Lake Success, 27th) The drafting committee of the UN Political Committee decided today that the "Large Assembly" should handle cases that both countries encountered failure, representing a victory for the United States. The United States strongly opposed China and France's efforts to restrict the power of the Small Assembly. According to Gu Weijun, China's position is that including "disputes" within the scope of the Small Assembly's power would give the impression that it would conflict with the Security Council's power to handle disputes. Gu stated that if the Small Assembly is dealing with disputes that the Security Council has already handled but cannot resolve, that would be another matter.</p>
<h3>UN Condemns "War Propagandists" Case: Soviet Union Gains Moral Victory, Original Proposal Rejected, Compromise Suggestion Adopted</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] The United Nations Political Committee gave the Soviet Union a major moral victory on the 27th, passing a compromise proposal with 56 votes against zero, "Any country that engages in or encourages acts of threatening peace, disrupting peace, or aggression should be condemned, and each member state is requested to take appropriate steps to promote friendly relations among countries within the framework of the Charter." After a three-and-a-half-hour meeting and thirteen votes, the United States realized that if it continued to oppose the compromise proposal, it would suffer a disastrous defeat, so it reluctantly took the same position as other countries, voting in favor of the final recommendation, and the stalemate was broken. This is the first time that small countries intending to reconcile have cooperated to pull back the United States and the Soviet Union, which tend to be extreme, and achieve success in adopting a middle ground plan. During the voting, the attitudes of the two major powers began to waver. The Soviet Union first canceled the clause condemning the United States, Greece, and Turkey for selling war, and the Political Committee continued to reject the remaining parts of the team proposal and moved to accept the compromise proposal of France, Australia, and Canada.</p>
<h3>UN Mediation Committee to Fly to Indonesian Capital Today</h3>
<p>(United Press, Batavia, 28th) The United Nations Committee for Mediation of the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute announced today that it will fly to Yogyakarta tomorrow, accompanied by the Deputy Foreign Minister of Indonesia and two other officials, and is expected to return here on the 30th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] The United States suggested to the Security Council on the 27th to instruct the Security Council's Tripartite Conciliation Committee to prohibit the Netherlands or Indonesia from occupying with military force areas not occupied at the time of the ceasefire announced by the Security Council on August 4.</p>

Consuls of various countries stationed in Los Angeles are all members of the committee. According to the American prediction, a well-known illustrator and member of the committee, Vargas, declared that "the alliance of beauties promotes friendship between countries and is more powerful than any peace treaty."</p>

<h3>Juvenile Police Squad Dispatched: Begins Inspecting Restaurants Today: Four Steps for Dealing With Violators of Thrift: Temporarily Not Involving Family Banquets</h3>
<p>The thrift measures for banquets in this city officially began on the 20th. In order to thoroughly investigate whether various Chinese and Western restaurants are earnestly complying, the municipal authorities have assigned 30 female police officers from the police bureau and selected 50 children from the Orphanage and Education Center to form a juvenile police squad to set off in groups to inspect. It is learned that the inspection work is officially scheduled to begin today. The police and social bureaus will supervise the juvenile police squad members to go to various restaurants in batches to begin the inspection. If it is found that there is a violation of the menu prices set by the thrift conference, it will be dealt with in the following steps: 1. Admonition, 2. Warning, 3. Fine, 4. Revocation of business license. The inspection team members will temporarily not interfere with family banquets. At the same time, the municipal government has ordered the finance and police bureaus to dispatch plainclothes personnel at any time to secretly inspect various restaurants. [Another report] The price limit for set meals stipulated in the thrift measures for banquets is 25,000 yuan per person. However, the highest price for set meals sold in restaurants throughout the city is only 20,000 yuan, and the lowest is 10,000 yuan. Therefore, the thrift price limit has the suspicion of raising prices. According to the person in charge of the municipal government, the price limit for set meals of 25,000 yuan is the highest price stipulated, in order to limit the price of set meals in the future, all must not exceed this number.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Shen Answers Various Current Questions: Confiscated Goods Should Be Unsealed and Returned If There Is No Suspicion of Hoarding: Hopes to Extend the Implementation Time of the Dance Ban</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Municipal Secretary-General Shen Zonglian met with reporters yesterday and answered various questions, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Food Issues: The city does not lack rice reserves. I believe that the rumor of implementing food rations per capita may be difficult to implement because Chinese people have different eating habits for rice and wheat. It is not a must-do at present.</p>
<p>Economic Inspection: Recently, the general public may have misunderstandings about economic inspections, thinking that legitimate merchants' inventories are being sealed, affecting business, and that the handling is excessive. In fact, the police bureau's implementation of inspection work is entirely based on confidential reports, and inspections are only conducted if there is suspicion of hoarding. According to the law, non-industry merchants who have concrete evidence of hoarding will be confiscated and severely punished. For industry merchants, their accounts will be checked to see if there is suspicion of hoarding, and then a decision will be made on how to deal with it. This is the principle of economic inspection to crack down on hoarding and speculation. It does not mean that after the sealing, business is not allowed or that it will be confiscated. If the incoming and outgoing goods are indeed legitimate business and there is no suspicion of hoarding, they will of course be unsealed and returned.</p>
<p>Important Statement·Dance Ban Issue The Dance Ban Issue: The Central Thrift Supervision Committee will convene a meeting in Beijing on the 29th to discuss the dance ban in Shanghai. Social Bureau Director Wu Kaixian will go to Beijing on the evening of the 28th to participate in the report. What I must solemnly state is that the municipal government does not disapprove of the dance ban, nor does it fail to implement the central government's orders. However, considering the livelihood of the employees of the dance halls, I hope that the implementation period will be slightly extended so that they have ample opportunity to change careers.</p>
<p>200,000 Refugees·Urgently Need Relief Winter Relief Issue: This year, at least 200,000 refugees have come to Shanghai due to disasters in various places. Among these 200,000 refugees, at least 100,000 are in urgent need of relief. Local government agencies have limited manpower and financial resources. I hope that all sectors and charitable organizations will cooperate and promote charitable deeds together.</p>
<p>Car Issues·The Rumor Is Untrue Restriction on the Use of Cars: Our city has temporarily suspended the transfer of car ownership and the issuance of new licenses in accordance with the central government's intention, and has asked the Executive Yuan to approve detailed measures. It is rumored that some vehicles in this city are registered in Nanjing and have returned to Shanghai to operate. According to regulations, foreign vehicles are only allowed to operate in this city for one month. After the deadline, fuel purchase certificates will not be issued, and the central government's regulations on who can use cars and who cannot use cars are universal and not different due to local differences, so this statement is actually wrong.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Business of the Social Bureau Is Transferred to the Civil Affairs Bureau for Management</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Part of the civil affairs business originally under the jurisdiction of the Social Bureau will be transferred to the newly established Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau.

<h3>The First Phase of Demolition on Tianmu Road Involves 14 Households Including Datong Bookstore</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Council resolved at the fourth plenary meeting to demolish the widening project on the southern part of Tianmu Road and the demolition of houses in phases within six months, the Bureau of Public Works summoned officials and owners and residents several times to explain.

<h3>Japan's Return of the Wo Shun Steamer to Shanghai Will Be Delayed by a Day or Two</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wo Shun, the third private vessel returned to our country by Japan, sailed from Japan on the 21st. As of last night, the exact date of arrival at the port has not yet been determined. It is generally believed that it may be delayed by a day or two due to reasons such as adding coal and weather.

<h3>Paper Inventory to Be Registered: No More Than Three Months' Inventory Allowed</h3>
<p>[Dagong News Agency] Regarding the issue of thoroughly investigating paper hoarding, Municipal Secretary-General Shen told reporters yesterday afternoon that the paper merchants and paper mills should be limited in their paper inventories, only allowing them to have an inventory equivalent to three months of sales. Those exceeding this limit will be considered hoarding for profit. This regulation will be implemented after the approval of the Economic Inspection Committee.

<h3>It Is Very Difficult to Explain Whether the Dance Ban Is Frugal: Director Wu Hopes That Local Governments Can Handle It At Their Discretion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Bureau went to Beijing by night train yesterday to represent the municipal government at the thrift talks to discuss the dance ban. Before the trip, Director Wu told reporters: "It is very difficult to explain whether the dance ban is frugal. If the dance halls in this city have all made firm guarantees to strictly implement frugality, and even the clothing of the dancers is stipulated to use domestic products in order to avoid wasting foreign exchange, then the purpose of the central government's determination to ban dancing and suppress dance girls seems to be to maintain good customs." He also said: "We extremely hope that the central government can understand the difficulties of the local government and hand over this issue to the local governments to handle it themselves in light of the actual situation."</p>
<h3>Various Receipts Issued on Both Routes Will Be Changed to Filling in the Date of the Day Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The date of stamping and filling in the passenger tickets and baggage and parcel transportation receipts issued by the stations of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway District has always been based on the date when the passenger train arrives at the terminal station. For example, the passenger train that departs from Shanghai to Beijing at 9:50 PM today will arrive in Nanjing after 0:00 AM the next day. The date of stamping and filling in various receipts will be based on the time of the second day. This regulation was originally an accounting procedure to facilitate the stations' remittance of funds. However, the general public and merchants are unaware of the intention and are easily suspicious, and often ask questions. The bureau has recently decided to revise it from the first of next month. All kinds of passenger tickets, baggage tickets, and various passenger miscellaneous transportation receipts will be stamped or filled in with the date of the day. Trains departing after 0:00 AM will be stamped or filled in with the date of the next day. Coal Prices Soar Continuously, Discussing Ways to Suppress Prices</p>

<h3>Expenses Increase Greatly, Income Is Limited: Municipal Hospital Discusses Funding</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] There are a total of 12 municipal hospitals in this city, with 7-800 employees.

The municipal government has agreed to allocate the increased living allowance for employees in October. How to deal with the situation after October remains to be discussed. From next year, it is rumored that the salaries of public school staff will be calculated according to the index, but the medical fees of public hospitals cannot be calculated according to the index, so the Health Bureau is looking for remedial measures.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Eighteenth District Chief Accused of Assault, Trial Concluded</h3>

On September 23 of this year, he entrusted his friend Gao Weimin to discuss the matter with Pan Chenghu, the district chief. Pan refused, stating that the application deadline had already passed. The two argued for a long time without resolution, leading to deepening misunderstandings and a verbal altercation.

<h3>All Prisoners Seek to Reform, Submit Joint Petition in Fine Calligraphy to the City Council</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration will convene a National Judicial Conference in Beijing on November 5, where amnesty regulations after the implementation of the constitution will also be discussed. Upon hearing this news, all prisoners in Shanghai Prison yesterday jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai City Council, requesting the authorities to pay attention to the principle of "leniency and broad pardon" and grant prisoners nationwide the opportunity to "reform and start anew." The original letter, approximately three thousand characters in length, was written in fine calligraphy on yellow maobian paper. Excerpts of the three appeals presented in the original letter are as follows:</p>
<p>Amnesty and Grace Have Not Been Widely Bestowed</p>
<p>The motives behind our crimes are indeed pitiful. However, the amnesty order issued by the National Government on New Year's Day in the 36th year of the Republic, as anyone slightly familiar with the law can point out, is merely a timely embellishment of official documents that outwardly displays benevolence but does not truly extend grace. If we open the Chinese Criminal Code and read it, we find that, except for the sections on public morals and pickpocketing, the rest have been repealed and replaced by four special criminal regulations: "Punishing Traitors," "Punishing Embezzlers," "Punishing Bandits," and "Punishing Opium Traffickers." Among these four special regulations, only the "Punishing Bandits" regulation, due to the limitation of the most severe principal penalty, allows for reduced sentences. The remaining three are not included in the amnesty order's provisions for pardon. Therefore, those who can truly benefit from the amnesty are only those convicted of pickpocketing and offenses against public morals, who can be released in a short period of time even without an amnesty order. Why is it that the government, while showing compassion to the innocent and granting amnesty, is unwilling to give those who have stumbled the opportunity to repent and correct their past mistakes? If the government believes that we are all heinous and extremely wicked criminals, then it should be noted that many of us were deemed by judges at the time of sentencing to meet the pardonable circumstances under Article 59 of the Criminal Code and had our sentences reduced accordingly. This proves that we are all individuals who accidentally fell into the legal net or were forced by circumstances to err. We are not habitual offenders who make crime a profession. However, in the government's amnesty order, which proclaims that grace should be widely bestowed upon the world, we do not benefit from the government's grace because of our pardonable circumstances.</p>
<p>The Elderly, Weak, Women, and Children are Crying Out for Food. Of course, there is a need for the government's legislation and authority to be adapted to the times, and the people have no right to criticize other than to obey. We do not seek to conceal our crimes; we have already reaped the consequences and been punished by the law. However, under the government's measure of "patting flies but not hitting tigers," how much practical effect has the so-called "strict law" adapted to the times achieved? The facts tell us that, to date (since New Year's Day of the 36th year of the Republic), the number of prisoners in custody nationwide has reached over 1.5 million, which exceeds the record of any previous year. If we assume that each prisoner has an average of five family members, then there are over six million elderly, weak, women, and children in society who are suffering, innocent people whose crying out for food and living in starvation deserves the government's relief and compassion.</p>
<p>Hope to Promulgate Labor Service Regulations. Our pain can only be known by those who have experienced it firsthand. Although our situation is our own fault, every drowning person wants to be rescued and reach the other shore. Although we have experienced deep pain and fallen into the dark abyss, for the sake of our pitiful families, as long as we can breathe and survive, we certainly hope for freedom and the coming of light. The government's pardon is certainly what we pray for, but we also hope that the judicial authorities can promulgate a labor service regulation like the military law authorities, and we pray that the restrictions and standards of the regulation be as lenient as possible, and the procedures be simplified as much as possible, to make up for our deficiencies. For those who commit crimes for the first time by mistake, grace should be given to treat them leniently or to change the sentence to probation so that we can have more opportunities to reform and start anew.</p>
<h3>Qian Zelin and Zhu Qiyi Sentenced Separately for Fraud</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhu Qiyi and his friend Qian Zelin were accused of defrauding Qian Peizhen, Qian Zelin's cousin, of the land registration receipt for nine houses located on a five-qiu, eight-hao plot of land at 10 Nian Road, Lu Tusefuwei, Ren Shou Li, Ninghai Road, Huangpu District. They were accused of privately mortgaging the property and squandering the money. After several hearings by Judge Wu Shaochang of the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court, the verdict was announced yesterday: "Qian Zelin is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for continuous fraud; Zhu Qiyi is sentenced to six months of imprisonment for continuous fraud; Qian Zelin shall immediately return the land registration certificate and seal issued by the Land Administration Bureau to the plaintiff."</p>
<h3>Abandoned by Cotton Mill Accountant, Shao Woman Sheds Tears Recounting</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] He Shuqiong, a young woman from Guangdong, accused Liu Yuhe, an accountant at the Wing On Cotton Mill, of abandonment and defamation. The case was heard in court at the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, and He recounted the abandonment she had experienced, shedding tears as she spoke. According to He's accusation, she and Liu participated in the 13th group wedding organized by the Shanghai Municipal Government on April 7, 1937, and have been married for eleven years, with a son named Qiming, who is now nine years old. He's father, Bo Xuan, had given He 1,000 yuan in Wing On Cotton Mill shares as inheritance, which Liu had allegedly swindled away. In 1942, Liu lost his job and faced financial difficulties. He worked as a laborer, using the earnings from washing clothes to support her mother and son. After the victory against Japan, Liu found employment at the Wing On Cotton Mill with a substantial income. He became involved with a wealthy woman and, showing preference for the new, repeatedly coerced He into divorce without success. Eventually, he abandoned He completely, leaving her with no choice but to work as a laborer in the home of the Guo family at 58 Yongle Fang, Hengbang Bridge, North Sichuan Road, visiting Qiming several times a month. Because he was unable to force the divorce, Liu harbored deep resentment and even published advertisements falsely claiming that he and He were living together and that He had abandoned her family in 1943, disappearing without a trace and finding someone else. After He hired a lawyer to publish a rebuttal, she sued Liu for repeated abandonment and defamation, requesting that the court order him to provide alimony for her support and submitting their wedding photos as evidence. The prosecutor had summoned Liu Yuhe and his son Qiming, but they were unable to be served, and they did not appear in court yesterday. The hearing was rescheduled for another date.</p>

<h3>Youth High School, Large Contingent of Police Officers Apprehend Drunk</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At around 11:30 PM last night, a drunken foreigner suddenly appeared at Youth High School, located at 553 Lin Sen Middle Road, went straight to the third floor, acted erratically, and arbitrarily destroyed tables and chairs. The faculty and staff were perplexed, mistaking him for a robber, and called the Lujiiawan Police Station to report the robbery. Duty officer Ni Jiafeng led dozens of police officers in police vehicles to the scene. The drunken man was extremely violent, throwing wooden chairs and other objects. The station was contacted again to send a large contingent of security police to surround and apprehend him. At the same time, the General Bureau was also notified, and Criminal Section Chief Hou Junhou personally led officers to assist in the capture. The man was taken back to the General Bureau for strict interrogation. He confessed that he was a French national named Permon, 39 years old, a coppersmith, currently unemployed and reduced to a thief. He admitted that he intended to break into the school to steal, and that he had committed this disgraceful act due to excessive drinking, hoping for leniency.</p>

<h3>Dismembered Statue of the Goddess of Peace Needs 300 Million in Medical Expenses, Repairs to Begin Once City Council Approves Funding</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Shanghai boasts a considerable number of bronze and stone statues and monuments, many of which are unfamiliar to most people. However, anyone who lived in Shanghai before the war will remember the enormous bronze statue of the "Goddess of Peace" that once stood on the Bund outside the Yangjingbang. The goddess's head was bowed, her arms outstretched, and a bronze monument was erected below, commemorating the Allied soldiers who died in the First World War. Unfortunately, the power of the Goddess of Peace could not withstand the evil forces of warmongers, and another major war broke out not long after. The Japanese knew nothing of peace and only knew how to manufacture poison gas. When their "Imperial Army's" guns and cannons ran out of ammunition, they set their sights on the large amount of copper and iron in the Goddess of Peace. Therefore, they spared no expense and disregarded everything, dismantling and removing the complete goddess and the two angels accompanying her. Fortunately, the warmongers soon surrendered unconditionally, and the Goddess of Peace finally returned wounded to the British Consulate, spared from destruction. However, her body, wings, and companions were all in pieces. Because the British Consulate was unable to store such a large bronze statue (because even the upper half of the goddess's body could not be lifted by a crane), they had no choice but to pile her in an open space, exposed to the elements, surrounded by rusty barbed wire.</p>
<p>Recently, the British United Services Association, on the one hand, could not bear to throw the goddess into the fire pit, and on the other hand, felt that the world really needed some peace to serve as a warning. Therefore, they proposed that the Municipal Government repair it. Mayor Wu also shared this sentiment and submitted a request to the City Council to discuss and make a decision on the matter. After discussions by the City Council's Public Works Subcommittee, they prepared to submit a resolution at the upcoming fourth general meeting.</p>
<p>However, the cost of repairing the Goddess of Peace is considerable. According to current estimates, the entire project (including the burial mound, etc.) to restore it to its original state would cost approximately 300 million yuan. The extent of the damage is as follows: the three bronze statues, large and small, have been broken into six pieces. The Goddess's right shoulder is sunken, her head is tilted to the right, the back of her head is dented, both wings are broken, with the tip of the left wing missing approximately five feet in length and two feet in width. A section of the front panel is missing, approximately four and a half feet long, two feet wide, and one foot high. At the same time, all three bas-reliefs below the tower are missing. The Municipal Government plans to repair the statue, reinforce the tower base and burial mound, and also build up the bank along the Huangpu River to prevent collapse. After the restoration, the bas-reliefs below the statue will be replaced with a victory commemoration of the Second World War, with revised inscriptions and commemorative bas-reliefs to reflect the current situation.</p>
<p>As for how to raise these funds, the plan is to organize a committee to jointly solicit donations from various expatriate communities in Shanghai, with the Municipal Treasury bearing a portion of the cost to demonstrate its leadership. This proposal is just waiting for the upcoming City Council meeting to make a decision. If it is approved, the Goddess of Peace will soon stand tall on the riverbank once again, reuniting with us.</p>

<h3>Female Young Women’s Christian Association Representatives, Pei Qin, and Others Discuss Sweden and New Zealand in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Hangzhou Correspondent on the 25th] Taking advantage of the World YWCA conference in Hangzhou, our reporter took the opportunity to interview representatives from various national organizations, broadly exchanging opinions on post-war life, national economies, educational systems, and the status of women. However, once the conversation began, everyone was filled with complaints. Regarding the current situation, most people were dissatisfied with reality. It was as if we were raising our heads full of hope to look at the sun, but the sky was always covered with heavy clouds of sorrow. Fortunately, these clouds of sorrow were dispelled by the representatives from Sweden and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Two Ladies Make Proud Statements</p>
<p>Miss Kajsa Barck Lagergern and Miss Jean Begg, representatives of the YWCA from Sweden and New Zealand, told me in proud tones, "Everyone in our country has food to eat, everyone has work to do, and everyone has books to read."</p>
<p>Miss Kajsa Barck Lagergern said, "In Sweden, all children between the ages of eight and thirteen are required to attend school, and children under the age of fourteen are absolutely prohibited from working in factories."</p>
<p>Forty Hours Per Week</p>
<p>Miss Jean Begg said, "New Zealand can proudly boast to the world about implementing a forty-hour work week. In our country, no boss has the right to ask employees to work more than forty hours a week. Workers work less than seven hours a day, and everyone has time off on Saturday afternoons and Sundays."</p>
<p>Free Education for Students of All Levels</p>
<p>They seemed exceedingly proud as they highlighted the strengths of their respective countries. In fact, from individual interviews conducted by our reporter, it was discovered that Sweden and New Zealand do indeed have many identical advantages that can serve as models for other countries. In terms of education, schools are run by the government, and from kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, to university, education is completely free. In Sweden, there is a minimal tuition fee for attending advanced vocational schools, but those from impoverished families can apply for exemptions. Ordinary middle schools are co-educational, while advanced colleges are mostly segregated by gender. Boys have more physical training courses, while girls have subjects such as cooking and sewing. Because education is free, everyone has the opportunity to receive education, and gender equality in education is naturally absolute.</p>
<p>In terms of employment, everyone in the country has a job. New Zealand strictly implements the forty-hour work week, and although Sweden does not have such a system, everyone has reasonable working hours and can receive the compensation they deserve, enough to maintain a life above the standard. Therefore, in those countries, it is often impossible to find a place to eat dinner after 6:30 PM because everyone goes home to enjoy family time.</p>
<p>Whether in Sweden or New Zealand, all citizens, regardless of gender, receive a considerable retirement pension at the age of seventy-five. At the same time, the government runs nursing homes where elderly people can spend their golden years in comfort by paying minimal fees. Therefore, the elderly do not have to worry about their declining years.</p>
<p>Hospitals Run by the Government</p>
<p>In terms of medical care, all hospitals are run by the government, and citizens can receive free diagnosis and treatment and receive all medications free of charge. During periods of illness, employees continue to receive their salaries in full upon providing a certificate from a doctor. Therefore, no one has to worry about illness or living while sick.</p>
<p>A Gigantic Snake Scares Away Voters, Election Site in Pixian, Western Sichuan, Plunged into Chaos Due to Stunt</p>
<p>[Report from Our Chengdu Correspondent on the 25th] In Pixian, Western Sichuan, during the re-election of the village chief, one candidate, known for his snake-handling skills, fearing defeat in the election, wrapped a gigantic snake around his waist, wore an overcoat, and entered the polling place. When he saw that the situation was turning against him, he angrily removed his overcoat and brandished the snake, scattering voters and plunging the entire venue into chaos. The election was indefinitely postponed, making it the greatest stunt in the election.</p>
<p>Gender Equality in Society</p>
<p>Regarding women, nearly ninety percent of women hold jobs outside the home. Marriage is absolutely free, and in politics, society, and treatment, women are completely equal to men. (Miss Barck Lagergren told the reporter that in Sweden, there are still very few instances of unequal pay between men and women. The National Association of Working Women is currently uniting to fight for change and believes that it will be improved soon.) To accommodate women's work, childcare centers are widespread throughout the country. Mothers drop off their children at the childcare center before going to work and pick them up after work. The fees are extremely low, and the facilities are extremely well-equipped. National laws explicitly stipulate that women be granted appropriate leave before and after childbirth. Swedish labor laws also stipulate that mothers can return home to breastfeed every few hours. Therefore, in those countries, children and family do not affect women's careers, and women can pursue their careers like men.</p>
<p>There are no domestic servants in Sweden and New Zealand, and everything is done by themselves. Miss Begg said, "We don't need them. Cooking is done with gas, washing is done with machines, working hours are short, and everyone has plenty of time to manage household chores."</p>
<p>Abolish the Death Penalty, Broadly Implement Rehabilitation</p>
<p>The reporter also remembers Miss Barck Lagergren specifically telling me that there is no death penalty in Sweden and that criminals are given rehabilitation education. She said, "Most people in our country are Christians, and everyone believes that everyone in the world can be reborn."</p>
<p>At the time, I nodded involuntarily, and I felt warmth all over my body. It was as if I saw the dark clouds disperse and the golden light shine brightly. The current state of Sweden and New Zealand is not comparable to the "Great Harmony" world advocated by Confucius. Looking at others and thinking about ourselves, naturally the distance is a bit far, but it is realistic. As long as we have this belief and are determined to pay any price. (Special correspondent Hong Xucai)</p>
<h3>熱河魚鱗石</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Rehe, 28th) There are two locations where the Rehe fish-scale stones are produced: one is in the Xinhuangdi area of Chaoyang County, and the other is in Wangjiadian, north of Lingyuan County. The Xinhuangdi products are mostly clustered, resembling many fish gathered together. Unfortunately, the stone is not very strong and can be peeled off layer by layer. The Lingyuan County products are individual in shape. A reporter once saw one in a local stall, resembling a live fish. Locals say there is another type of fish-scale stone, with the fish inside the stone, and the stone is transparent, looking like swimming in water, which is very vivid.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th Incident," the Japanese invaded Rehe and extensively excavated in Lingyuan and Chaoyang. They dispatched many geological history and archaeological experts to conduct on-site investigations, transporting the excavated fish-scale stones to their country, claiming them as relics from 3 million years ago. The fish-scale stones discovered in Rehe today are undoubtedly ancient fish that were submerged and transformed over many years.</p>

The audience seats were full. Shen strongly argued and quibbled about extorting filial offerings from various branches. The income of each branch was as high as over 217 million yuan, but only over 5 million yuan was paid to the landlords by the Yin Guo branch, and no payments were made by any other branches. This is an unprecedented major case of encroaching on the interests of landlords and tenants. The accounts of each branch were all falsified, and many items of expenditure were fabricated. The court hearing started at 9:00 AM and lasted until 1:00 PM. Because further investigation is needed, Shen was remanded, and the rest were released on bail.</p>

<h3>優遊的剎那　世界女靑年代表大會閉幕聲中　在杭州西泠飯店內外自由活動</h3>
<p>(This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 28th) The sun rises over the city, and West Lake is still shrouded in mist. The Xiling Hotel has begun to stir. Representatives from twenty-three countries around the world are busy combing their hair, washing, and bathing... At exactly eight o'clock, the bell rings, and a sumptuous breakfast is ready. Everyone gathers in the dining hall, and after eating, they have to rush to the Foreign Guests Reception Center for a meeting. Time is really tight, and everyone is in such a hurry.</p>
<p>The meeting starts at nine o'clock and lasts until twelve o'clock, with only a fifteen-minute break, just enough to drink a cup of tea. The younger representatives look at the autumn scenery outside the meeting place, shining in the sun, and are clearly a little restless. Finally, the bell rings again, and the meeting is adjourned. Unfortunately, their stomachs are already rumbling. So, a bus takes them back to Xiling again. Mealtime is always the best opportunity for administrative reports, such as where the afternoon meeting will be held, which countries' representatives the chairman wants to talk to after the meal, etc. But today, the chairman suddenly became merciful and announced: "Free activities this afternoon." Oh! Ha! The whole place is filled with cheers.</p>
<p>After the meal, the representatives split into several groups for sightseeing. Those who like to go into the lake went boating. Another team set off for Hupao Spring, Liuhe Pagoda, Jiuxi Eighteen Streams, and Zhijiang University. The Finnish representative loves to ask questions: "What does Liuhe mean?" "Liuhe means east, west, north, south, heaven, and earth." "Why is it called 'he'?" ... No one can answer.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at a temple, the Indian representative is the best guide. She will tell you what the name of this Buddha is, how it is designed in India, and what the differences are between the composition and color of Indian temples and Chinese temples.</p>
<p>Whenever hiking, the German representative feels the most difficulty because she is short of breath and coughs a lot, often falling behind. The Swedish representative takes care of her everywhere, and the two are very close.</p>
<p>The Korean representatives are the most popular. Zhijiang University and Hongdao Girls' High School have both invited them. They said, "We would rather sacrifice sightseeing time and are willing to have more contact with Chinese students." So, one gives a speech, one translates, and another performs songs.</p>
<p>As the sun sets on North Peak, everyone gathers again in the Xiling dining room. During the meal, they exchange the experiences of their half-day tour, with joy and enthusiasm. But after dinner, everyone still has to go to the meeting with their tired bodies.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock at night, everyone returns from the meeting place and goes to their rooms to rest. This is when they sort out trivial matters. The German representative is thinking of friends who are starving, the chairman is arranging the agenda for tomorrow's meeting, the Chinese representatives are planning the reception, and the Mexican girl is reading a love letter under the moonlight, saying: Hangzhou is really the most ideal place to spend a honeymoon, and she will write to her lover to suggest it!</p>
<p>For fourteen days, these representatives have lived in the Xiling Hotel in Hangzhou, and everyone feels relaxed and beautiful. Now the World YWCA Conference is over, and everyone is about to leave. Many people want to go to Nanjing because they say, "It is rare to have the opportunity to come to China, and we must see the capital." There are also many people planning to go to Beiping because its magnificence is known worldwide. There are even more people who must return to their countries. However, no matter where they go in the world, they will never forget to pray for the unity and peace of the world. (Special Correspondent Hong Xucai)</p>

<h3>私校未立案前學生學籍問題　敎部訂定補救辦法</h3>
<p>(This Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th) The Ministry of Education issued a notice to the education departments of all provinces and cities on the 28th. Regarding the issue of the academic status of students in private schools that have not been approved for registration, in consideration of the special difficulties during the War of Resistance and the rehabilitation period, a remedial measure was specially formulated: 1. For private secondary schools in the recovered areas that were unable to complete registration procedures when the government moved west and did not apply to the organization for registration, those that have now been approved for registration will be allowed to submit the academic status of students before registration for verification and recognition. Their graduates' graduation certificates will be allowed to be re-stamped. 2. Private secondary schools in non-occupied areas during the War of Resistance, which have now been approved for registration, should be required by the education departments of each province and city to hold examinations within a time limit for graduates before registration. Those who pass will be allowed to recognize their graduation qualifications and stamp their graduation certificates. The examination methods and subjects should be handled with reference to the regulations of the high school student graduation exam courses. 3. Private secondary schools that have not yet been approved for registration should be strictly ordered to register within a time limit. Those that are not well run should be investigated and banned. Graduates of these schools who wish to continue their studies in the 37th academic year will also be allowed to apply for public and registered private colleges and universities with equivalent qualifications. The above measures will be completed and reported to the Ministry for record by the end of July of the 37th year. Private secondary schools that were originally approved for registration before the war, but did not move out during the occupation and did not register with the puppet organization, and are now continuing to operate, should be investigated by the various departments to verify the operating conditions over the years.</p>

<h3>鄂教育廳搶救匪區失學青年</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Hankou, 27th) The Hubei Provincial Department of Education should rescue the out-of-school youths in the bandit areas of eastern Hubei. It has accepted more than 1,600 students in Hankou and established the First Temporary Middle School. Now, students are fleeing to Hankou one after another from the bandit areas.

<h3>教部重視東北教育長白師範不遷遼陽</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th) Regarding the education issues in the Northeast provinces, the Ministry of Education pays great attention to them. Although Changchun was in a dangerous city a few years ago, the Ministry actively established Changchun University, the scale of which is the largest in the country. However, due to the instability of the military, the school affairs have been greatly affected. Since the victory, Changbai Normal College has also been established in Yongji. It is rumored that it will be moved to Liaoyang, but this is not the case. However, because some faculty and students of the college took refuge in Liaoyang when the Communist bandits attacked last time, and the railway has not been restored, some faculty and students have requested to stay in Liaoyang for the time being. These are all temporary measures. Now, the National Zhongshan Middle School in Shenyang has long been approved to be established in Changchun. As soon as the situation stabilizes, it will be moved north. The Ministry of Education has also planned to establish a science museum and a library in Changchun. In the Ministry's plan, Changchun's educational status is more important than Shenyang. Therefore, the development of cultural undertakings will be focused on advancing north.</p>

<h3>黃山遣族學校募得美金十萬　陳文淵由美返滬談</h3>

He participated in various international Episcopal gatherings in the United States and Canada. He arrived in Shanghai on the 27th afternoon by the Marinus Wulos wheel. A reporter visited Dr. Chen yesterday. According to him, he attended the International Rotary Club Conference in San Francisco in June, with representatives from 15,000 countries around the world. It is the largest religious gathering in international history. He served as the vice chairman of the Canadian International Missionary Conference in July to discuss Christian education issues.

People from all walks of life in the United States are quite concerned about the current situation in China. The American people have a new estimate and understanding of the leftist elements in their country, and thus re-emphasis on the Chinese issue.

<h3>The Past and Present of the Malayan Chinese Football Team - Once a Formidable Force</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Malayan Chinese Football Team is scheduled to come to Shanghai in the middle of next month, and the grand occasion of "Star East's" visit to Shanghai last year will be seen again. Here, let's briefly describe the historical facts of Malayan football.</p>
<p>Inter-City Competition</p>
<p>Originally, Malaya was divided into Singapore, Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Malacca, Selangor, Penang, Perak, Kedah, and other cities. As early as 1912 - the tenth year of the Republic of China, when Malayan football was gradually developing, the British warship "Malaya" happened to arrive and, seeing this situation, specially donated a large silver cup to organize the Malayan Inter-City Football Competition. First, the North and South parts competed separately, and then the champions of the two parts decided the championship.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the winner of the South has almost always been the Singapore team, while the North has been contested by Selangor, Perak, Penang, and other teams for the final. This annual inter-city competition has never been interrupted until the declaration of war between Britain and Japan, when it was stopped. During this period, most of the British troops stationed there also joined the competition. The level of Malayan football has been improved invisibly, and it should be attributed to the efforts to promote it in the past twenty years.</p>
<p>Participating in the National Games</p>
<p>Shanghai football fans may feel unfamiliar with the words "Malayan Chinese," because the Malayan Overseas Chinese Association formed a team to return to China to participate in the Sixth National Games held in October of the 24th year of the Republic of China. The participating items included track and field and football, with the football team's record being the most brilliant.</p>
<p>At that time, the football competition adopted an elimination system. In the preliminary round, the Malayan Chinese team defeated Liaoning with a score of 9-2. In the second round, they won against Zhejiang with a score of 12-0. In the semi-finals, they defeated the strong Hebei team with a score of 5-0, entering the top four.</p>
<p>That year, the football championship was won by the Hong Kong team, but the strength of the Malayan Chinese team and the Hong Kong team was almost equal. They competed for the final, and the Malayan Chinese team was still leading 2-1 in the first half. As a result, it was 2-2, and the Hong Kong team only won by one goal. The Malayan Chinese team then defeated the Shanghai team with a score of 3-1, and because the Guangdong team abstained, they were ranked as the runner-up. The lineup at that time was:</p>
<p>Champion: Hong Kong Team Bao Jiaping, Yu Qingyuan, Liang Xianzhan, Li Guowei, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Jiliang, Li Shuoyou, Li Zhaorong, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Runner-up: Malayan Chinese Team</p>
<p>Huang Jinbai, Cai Wenli, Zhen An, Lin Zhiquan, Jian Dehui, Lin Xifu, Du Yachi, Guan Xinde, Diao Qingfu, Yao Shenglian, Yin Jinzhen</p>
<p>Strength of the Malayan Chinese Team</p>
<p>Once the strength of the Malayan Chinese team was revealed, Malaya became the focus of attention in the football world. The "South China" and "Eastern" teams repeatedly went to Malaya, but no matter how well-equipped they were, they still could not achieve a complete victory. Taking the "South China's" second expedition to Malaya in mid-May of the 30th year of the Republic of China as an example, although they had Li Huitang, Xu Yijingcheng, Zhong Yongshen, Liu Songsheng, Li Shuoyou, Zou Wenzhi, Li Guowei, Liu Qingcai, etc., in all seventeen games, they won twelve games, lost two games, and drew three games, which was considered the most satisfactory result of all expeditions. This year, the "Star Island" team went to England. At the beginning of leaving Hong Kong, they won repeatedly and were very ambitious. Unexpectedly, they encountered the Malayan Chinese team in Singapore and were defeated with a score of 1-3. The "South China" team and the Shanghai Eastern Youth League team also lost to the Malayan Chinese team one after another after going abroad (won against the Eastern Youth League 1-0, won against South China 2-0).</p>
<p>From the historical facts near and far, under the above-mentioned environment, the strength of Malayan football, regardless of metabolism, has always been maintained at a very high level. This time, they gathered the essence of Chinese football players from all cities in Malaya to form a strong team to challenge Shanghai. It is said that their offensive and defensive capabilities are very strong. The Chen Jiashou and Jiawan brothers in the two backs defend like iron walls, and the forwards Zhuo Zhenyu and Xie Wenliang are representatives of Singapore. If it is not affected by the weather (Malayan Chinese players are afraid of the cold), it is not impossible to create a battle record that exceeds last year's "Star East." The Malayan Chinese team lineup is attached as follows:</p>
<p>Zhu Zhicheng, Chen Jiawan, Chen Jiashou, Shi Jinhai, Li Yuyou, Yang Jiazong, Qi Qingrong, Xie Wenliang, Mei Yuanhua, Zhuo Zhenyu, Huang Jihan</p>
<h3>Preliminary Consultation on Taking Over the Municipal Stadium Yesterday - The Gymnasium and Swimming Pool Will Be Taken Over First</h3>
<p>The personnel in charge of taking over the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium, after the Education Bureau appointed Director Jiang Zhouqing, and the Public Works Bureau appointed Director Wang Dingzeng, went to Jiangwan together with Engineer Xu Li, head of the section, at 3 pm yesterday for the initial takeover. As a result, it was not as difficult as imagined. The Municipal Gymnasium, the Municipal Swimming Pool, and the Great Auditorium can be taken over first, and the Municipal Stadium can also be taken over gradually. Once the Municipal Government replies to the Hong Kong Headquarters, the handover procedures can be formally carried out. The stadium staff will also be stationed in the stadium to work at the same time. The repair project will be fully handled by the Public Works Bureau. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau has sent personnel to Beijing to receive the repair materials compensated by the Ministry of National Defense the day before yesterday. If the number is insufficient, the Municipal Government will be requested to find other ways. Director Wang and Director Jiang both expressed considerable optimism about the takeover work after returning from Jiangwan yesterday. However, they hope that the Municipal Physical Education College can move in immediately during the formal handover, which will be of great benefit to storage and repair.</p>

<h3>Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan Talks - There is Absolutely No Such Thing as a 50,000 Yuan Bill - It is Not Yet the Time to Change the Monetary System - Financial Institutions Must Be Gradually Simplified</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and met with reporters at the Central Bank yesterday, describing in detail the various issues after the promulgation of the New Banking Law. According to him, there are three issues that should be paid attention to after the promulgation of the New Banking Law: First, the related laws and regulations that are not suitable before the promulgation of the New Banking Law should be announced and abolished separately after being reviewed one after another. Second, according to the provisions of the New Banking Law, the inspection matters of financial institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, and other parts of the country should be studied on how to continue to handle them. Third, according to the provisions of the New Banking Law, the conditions for new banks in the future and how to strengthen and improve the existing banks need to be studied. The Ministry of Finance is currently studying the above three points in detail in order to formulate appropriate and thorough measures. However, according to Xu Baiyuan's personal observations of international and domestic economic and political trends, financial institutions will gradually tend to be simplified in the future. In recent years, banks in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and Australia have gradually become nationalized and institutionalized. Therefore, it is believed that China will be quite strict in restricting the establishment of new banks in the future. Regarding the countermeasures for the establishment of provincial, municipal, and county local banks, they will generally be handled in accordance with the economic reform plan. Regarding the rumors that China will promote silver coins, he also expressed his personal opinion that this is still an economic way to reform the monetary system. However, this matter does not seem appropriate until the domestic economic situation is stable and the financial revenue and expenditure are balanced. Regarding the widespread rumors that 50,000 yuan bills are circulating in various agricultural areas, Xu Baiyuan categorically denied it, saying that 50,000 yuan bills have never been printed. Regarding the income and expenditure of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee since its establishment, he believes that it is very ideal. As for the current lending principles of the Four Joint Offices, they are still based on the three aspects related to the national economy, people's livelihood, and export. The total amount of loans approved by the office has reached more than 28 trillion yuan.</p>
<h3>Hua Stocks Fluctuate Uncertainly, Mostly Closing Transactions</h3>
<p>The bearish atmosphere of Hua stocks was even heavier yesterday, and the trading volume was pitifully small. The market was in a state of closing transactions, and it was difficult to make any progress. However, due to the actual needs, the urgent need to reduce the securities margin is said to be very likely. Major players in the lower-level industry have more buying interest, and it is easy to turn back after being tired. Therefore, the market price is in an uncertain state, and there are often small rebounds.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>Without escaping the tired situation, Yongsha was quoted at 288 yuan for immediate delivery and 292 yuan for deferred delivery. Shortly after opening, it fell back to a low of 286 yuan for immediate delivery and 288 yuan for deferred delivery. At 10:30, the interest rate rose to 1.8 jiao and 2.25 jiao, and the situation turned into a struggle, and then fell again to 286 yuan and 288 yuan. The monetary base loosened, and it was rumored that the securities margin might be reduced, so people's hearts were still stable and rose back to 294 yuan and 296 yuan. The noon closing price was 290 yuan and 294 yuan. Except for Datong Cement, which had limited transactions and fell more, the rest were very calm. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, immediate delivery shares of Xinguang, Tongyi, Lianan, Xinyi were still flat, Datong Cement fell by half a percent, and Yongsha, Zhabei, Xinhe, Meiya, China Silk, Rong, Huaxin, Hengfeng, Commercial, Huameng Match, Jinglun, Jingfu, Qinxing, China-France, and Xinhua fell slightly, and China Textile and Xinya Underwear rose slightly. Deferred delivery shares all fell slightly except for Huafeng and Xinguang, which were flat.</p>
<p>The market opened slightly stable in the afternoon, and after Yongsha saw 291 yuan and 295 yuan, the trading volume was even lower. Wuhe was quoted lower to the limit down. Yongsha fell back to a low of 286 yuan for immediate delivery and 287 yuan for deferred delivery. The exchange difference of state-owned banks increased a lot, and the rumors that the securities margin was reduced to 30% rose again. Before closing, it rebounded to a high of 294 yuan and 298 yuan, and then closed at a price of 294 yuan and 297 yuan. Xinya once shouted high to the limit up in the chaos, and underwear also jumped up a lot. The trading volume of domestic products was small, and they were traded at low prices instead. As a result, compared with the closing price, immediate delivery shares of Wuhe fell to the limit, Xinya rose to the limit and then rebounded, rising by half a percent, domestic products fell and underwear rose, each accounting for a strong 10%. Yongsha, Zhabei, Huaxin, Heng, Rongfeng, Xinhe, Tongyi, Meiya, China Silk, Huafeng Match, Jinglun Cement, Qinxing, China-France, and Xinhua rose slightly, Lianan was flat. Commercial, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Xinyi fell slightly. Deferred delivery shares of Xinguang and Meiya were flat, Yongsha and Xinhe rose slightly, and Qinxing and Jingfu rose slightly. The old shares and bank shares outside the market were still quiet, and then rose by half a percent, and the rest were just flat.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Plunge, Foreign Stocks Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bulls gave up on public bonds, and all hopes turned cold again. After a big rise, the counter-movement plummeted. Unified C opened at 280,000 yuan, and from 282,000 yuan, it went from bad to worse, falling back to around 226,000 yuan before it stabilized. Yanghang Gang and Wusansi Room sold, Wuwu Room also sold after entering, only Dacheng and slightly entered, the transaction was only 10 million. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Unified C plummeted by 6,500 yuan, and A, B, and D each fell by about 5,000, and Unified E fell back by 4,000 yuan. Foreign stocks rebounded again yesterday. Although foreign merchants sold, Qiandui Gang and Securities Gang came to absorb again. The Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange often reduced a little, and the monetary base loosened slightly. Yisha rose from 186,000 yuan to close outside at 200,000 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha, Yinglian, and Tram rose by half a percent, Huide, Ang rose by one percent, Yibei and Ken Zhi were flat, and Aviation, Steel, Telephone, Xiangtai Paper, Yeguang rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Fall All the Way, Oil Market Sees Further Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 14,900 stones of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. Early Bo rice arrived continuously in the south, and the market was sluggish. Japonica rice continued to fall by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and Ke Xian fell by another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Baiyuan cut by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and Yinyuan continued to fall wildly by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Early Bo rice fell sharply by 50,000 yuan in the middle and second grades, and Du Xian and Yang Xian followed the fall by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. During the period when late rice is on the market, the later form is still looking downstream.</p>
<p>Wheat bran was sluggish in rural sales, and fell wildly by 10,000 yuan. Flour was disheartened and fell by 10,000 yuan. At the close, the stores took advantage of the opportunity to take in, which seemed to be挺. Soybean cake oil head was suspended, and fell sharply by 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories picked and lowered the purchase price, and Mujie sold short and slightly moved. The guest gang had a slight transaction, but each item was supplied, and it fell back by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mung bean moved slightly in Southeast Asia, and the price form was stable. Adzuki bean arrived and sold in small quantities, and the price did not fluctuate. Cowpea digestion was bland, and the situation was flat and tired. The Shantou market for cowpea was cold and sluggish, and the market situation was depressed. Broad bean was moved separately, and it was still mediocre.</p>
<p>Red sorghum had no buyers and fell by 10,000 yuan. Corn's appetite in Qingdao was bland, and the shape tended to soften, falling by more than 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil factories looked forward, and under the fierce sell-off in the street, they continued to see a sharp drop of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were suddenly purchased by the Guangdong gang, and they rebounded after being tired, rising back by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The oil market gradually declined, raw soybean oil fell again by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and vegetable oil and refined oil fell by 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the rice industry, the rice market has plummeted in recent days, and the grain situation in this city seems to be improving, but the value of the rural areas' plowing and sales has depreciated, and they are exchanging for daily necessities. Because the demand for daily necessities is low, the income and expenditure are compared with each other, which actually makes the rural economy more and more impoverished. If this trend continues, it will form a hanging upside down, and it will be difficult for merchants to operate, and it is inevitable that the source will be blocked.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Rice Price Rises Step by Step</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] Guangzhou rice prices have been stimulated by the financial surge in recent days and have continued to increase. On the 28th, the price of top-quality rice has broken through the 500,000 yuan mark per dan, and there is still a tendency to continue to rise. In addition, the Guangdong Customs has recently issued an order strictly prohibiting passengers from carrying legal tender to Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Small Trading Volume of Export Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the transaction in the foreign tea market was sparse, and the market situation was temporarily difficult to be clear. The sales of internal floral designs in this street store, Suzhou, Wuxi, and near the suburbs have not stopped, and the market is still buying strongly. However, the number of openings is not large. The potential is still sharp.</p>
<p>Tea Merchants Hope to Exchange Chen Tea</p>
<p>Also, it is heard that tea merchants and the promotion office of the Transport Management Committee believe that the Chen tea of ​​the 35th year of the Republic of China acquired by the China Trust Bureau should be temporarily suspended from auction.

<h3>Floating Duos Compete to Sell, Yarn and Cloth See Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation was sluggish for both local and foreign customers, but dyeing and weaving factories on the way absorbed sporadically, and the market reported to be挺秀. However, there were few new buyers, and there were floating duos selling, and the closing price fell more than it rose. Finally, 42 Blue Phoenix yarn was sold for 33.6 million, a drop of 300,000 yuan from the previous day. Other rough yarns of various counts had ups and downs of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, due to the fact that there are a lot of chips in the cloth market, the path is idle, and the floating households compete to sell, the asking price is rarely encouraging. Finally, various grades of fine cloth such as 12-pound Longtou continued to fall by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan from the previous day. Ji Yuan Zhigong fell sharply by 20,000 to 75,000 yuan, but 190 Peach Blossom Lady Lin Cloth and White Cat Flower Cloth were still挺秀 for tens of thousands of yuan.</p>

<p>In order to encourage exports and earn foreign exchange, the Import and Export Management Committee has revised the "Measures for the Import of Raw Materials for Export Goods Manufacturing," submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review, and implemented the new measures in advance in order to seize the seasonal nature of exports and take care of the livelihoods of handicraftsmen. The case was officially passed at the general meeting held by the committee last Saturday. It is learned that the association has now started a pilot program with the Handcraft Straw Hat Export Industry Guild, registering the factories of various members. To date, about 40 manufacturers have applied to the Export Promotion Office. The raw materials are two types of hemp grass and gold silk grass. The foreign exchange earned by this handicraft often exceeds the cost a lot. If the raw materials are totaled at 300,000 US dollars, the price of the finished product can be worth more than 1 million US dollars. Furthermore, the profit of gold silk grass is three times, and the profit of hemp grass is six times. In order to prevent merchants from taking advantage of the opportunity, the association requires that all applicants for foreign exchange must provide a bank guarantee, that is, the raw materials obtained from the foreign exchange must be delivered in proportion to the finished products, and all foreign exchange must be handed over to the national treasury after the finished products are exported. It is learned that the association has expressed objections to the guarantee clause. The association has sent personnel to contact on the 28th, but the association has not accepted this requirement. It is also learned that the regulation was originally attached to List Three (A) and belonged to the non-quota import review department, with limited foreign exchange value, and the relevant authorities have first allocated it for抵充.</p>

<h3>Rayon Drops, Factory-Managed Silk Goods Continue to Be Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market was quite stable. No. 120 Asahi A-grade glossy had a maximum price of 79 million yuan in the morning, and then fell by 500,000 yuan, closing at 80 million yuan at noon. There were no changes in the afternoon, and the final asking price was still 80 million yuan, which was 1 million yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory-Managed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price reduction in the morning was similar to that of the previous day, and the transaction price in the afternoon was 2 million yuan lower than the previous day. The middle grade was sold for 60 million to 61 million yuan, and the high grade was sold for 62 million yuan, and both had a term of five to seven days.

<p>Number of Qualified Spring Silk Purchases</p>
<p>According to the news from the China Agricultural Bank: As of the day before yesterday, the spring silk delivered by silk factories in various places that had been inspected and qualified for purchase by the China Trust Bureau totaled 3,577 dans. About 6,000 dans were delivered to the bank.</p>
<p>Standard for Allocation of Rayon Has Been Set</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the China Trust Bureau has decided on the allocation of rayon based on the number of looms in each industry to obtain quotas for various places. Because Shanghai has a special environment, the demand is slightly larger, and the allocation standard is that Shanghai accounts for 65% of the silk weaving industry and 35% for other ports. Based on the number of looms, if there are 6,800 looms in Shanghai and the allocation quota is assumed to be 7,000 boxes per month, then Shanghai can allocate 4,550 boxes. For the weaving belt industry, if the allocation quota is assumed to be 580 boxes per month, Shanghai can allocate 500 boxes.</p>

<h3>Preventing Elevator Accidents</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Recent reports have detailed two elevator accidents resulting in injuries. These misfortunes are due to illegal usage. By design, each elevator door has a locking mechanism. When the door is opened, the power is cut off, and the elevator cannot operate. However, due to the high frequency of opening and closing each day, these mechanisms are easily damaged, often leading to shutdowns and disputes. As a result, drivers or repairmen sometimes simply bypass the door locks to achieve a quick fix, unaware that they are setting the stage for tragedy! I know this to be the case and cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to request that you expose this issue. Please urge all homeowners to conduct thorough inspections. If the elevator can still move while the door is open, there is a danger. With best regards, respectfully submitted by Bai Chongguang, formerly of the Watts Studio.</p>

<h3>Free Talk: Two Kinds of Literati - A Tentative Discussion of Jin Shengtan and Zhou Zuoren</h3>
<p>— Ying Yu</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people who look down on literati, are unwilling to be literati, but in the end, still become literati. One is of the Jin Shengtan type, and the other is of the Zhou Zuoren type. In terms of character, the former is far superior to the latter; in terms of demeanor, the former is even beyond the reach of the latter. But strangely, both deeply regret being literati.</p>
<p>Although both express "regret," there is a significant difference in their essence.</p>
<p>Indeed, Jin Shengtan was a literatus, and he also ridiculed and despised literati who specialized in helping or flattering others. "The more a person reads, the more they hate readers," (Annotation of Water Margin, Chapter 32). He only hated a portion of the literati because he himself was most sincere. Therefore, he was dissatisfied with the confused and ignorant people who submitted to the Manchus at the time. His contempt for the flattering literati of the time was by no means the inherent "literati belittling each other" mentality. Instead, it was a realization of the adulatory and ingratiating postures of literati in that era and environment, which made him feel a bit nauseated. His high praise and annotations of Water Margin, calling it the "Sixth Genius Book," must be understood from this state of mind—"If the rites are lost, seek them in the wilderness." Yes, Jin Shengtan eventually had to don the guise of "feigned madness" and engage in the work of annotating genius books not tolerated by the patriarchal society of the time. In reality, Jin Shengtan's contempt for literati stemmed precisely from his profound understanding of the weaknesses of intellectuals, which led him to make excessive demands of literati. He hated the yes-men-type of servants but hoped to see a few rebellious and unfilial subjects in the feudal dynasty. In the end, he was disappointed.</p>
<p>So, what is Zhou Zuoren's "regret for being a literatus" all about?</p>
<p>Not long ago, a reporter from a Nanjing newspaper visited the prison near Tiger Bridge and wrote an article titled "A Record of Visiting Traitors in Prison," in which he reported the following about Zhou Zuoren:</p>
<p>"Zhou Zuoren came from the Bitter Rain Studio. His life has never been particularly prosperous, except for a fondness for a cup of bitter tea. In the early days of his imprisonment, he wrote couplets and fan paintings for others to express his resentment. In the past month, his temperament has changed. He often complains that knowing a few more characters has made his life miserable. If he had not gained literary fame, no one would have dragged him into this mess. Being an unreasonable puppet educational superintendent brought him no enjoyment, and now he is only suffering more."</p>
<p>Zhou Zuoren's deep regret for knowing a few characters was not a "philosophy" he realized after entering prison. More than ten years ago, he had similar views. The reason is that he regarded himself as a typical figure among literati. Although he advocated leisure, spirituality, and detachment, he still had some self-awareness and knew that he was not qualified to be a standard servant. Because after knowing a few characters, many things could not be done too blatantly. Historical schemers like Liu Jin and Wei Zhongxian were not born as literati. Cui Chengxiu, who was born as a literatus, was only a second-rate servant. He was not particularly regretful that he had become a puppet educational superintendent. What made him most uncomfortable was that he "did not enjoy anything" when he was "in office." If the position had been more lucrative and profitable, then he should have considered his "knowing a few more characters" as a great fortune, right?</p>
<p>They are both literati. There are Wen Tianxiang and Qin Hui; there are Shi Kefa and Ruan Dacheng. Knowing a few more characters certainly gives one the qualification to be dragged into trouble, but it also depends on whether you have your own convictions. Zhou Zuoren's talent is not comparable to Ruan Dacheng, and his influence is also not as great. It seems that he is only of the Xiang Shuixin type from the late Ming Dynasty, and he is even more different from Jin Shengtan. Jin Shengtan fell into the Qing court's clutches because he led an anti-corruption movement. In Zhou Zuoren's eyes, it was the behavior of a fool. Although his own greed for small gains and great losses was even less intelligent.</p>
<h3>Unmarriageable Daughters</h3>
<p>— Zhixin</p>
<p>A few days ago, I met many classmates who graduated in the same year a few years ago at a gathering, and we couldn't help but feel emotional when we talked to each other. Recalling the happiness of student days, everyone is now running around for life, and the demeanor of the past has quietly passed away. What is especially emotional is that after asking each other, eight or nine out of ten, including myself, are still unmarried, and those who are married were married as early as school. Now we are all young people nearing thirty years old, and it is reasonable to get married, especially a few female classmates who are approaching the end of their prime. I didn't dare to ask directly, but after inquiring, they are all still single. We couldn't help but feel sad when we looked at each other. According to our research, the seriousness of unmarriageable daughters is actually greater than ours. Because we can wait a few more years to get married in our thirties, and it is not too late, but it is difficult for young ladies to avoid the feeling of being "past their prime" when they get married for the first time in their thirties. However, after careful study, the main reason for this phenomenon is themselves. Let me tell you:</p>
<p>At present, after leaving school, those who have a way to find a job usually have decent families. However, now that individual income can only barely support one person's life, it seems not worthwhile for such people to painstakingly manage a marriage. Even if they marry a daughter from a well-to-do family, they will not be able to afford it. So many people simply don't get married, enjoy a few years of single bliss, and talk about it when they have a way in the future. As a result, there are fewer people getting married.</p>
<p>There is also a group of people who are very interested in getting married because the family needs a helpmate. It doesn't matter if it's a bit hasty, and the partner is not a problem, but unfortunately, there is no fixed income. Because the family environment is poor, they did not finish their studies, and they have neither diplomas nor formal letters of introduction. It is really not easy to find a job. However, for the same woman, who is familiar with writing, it is much easier to find a job. Just look at any agency, company, or bank today, female employees often account for half of the total. In this case, many men with poorer qualifications will inevitably be unemployed, and at the same time, they will be deprived of the qualification to marry. The number of unmarriageable daughters is increasing year by year.</p>
<p>Today's so-called women of the times are very self-important. If they can get a job, they will sing high praises of independence and self-sufficiency, losing the virtue of being a female helpmate and not realizing that money does not come easily, creating wasteful habits. They don't even bother to look at men with slightly lower incomes. As a result, those who consider themselves to be as ugly as Ruan Ji's aunts don't have the courage to ask. This has delayed the youth of many young ladies!</p>
<p>The author's thinking is not stubborn at all, and there is no gender prejudice. Looking at the above, which is more important, marriage or career? May I ask you all, would you rather be unemployed or unmarriageable? If you still think that marriage is more reliable than a career, then you should resign from your job and go home to prepare to be a bride.</p>
<h3>Courtship in the Animal Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Linlin</p>
<p>Those who study natural science will definitely feel very interested in the courtship of animals. Yes, the various forms of animal courtship are really too human-like. The animal courtship scenes written here are only a part of the animal kingdom, but they are enough to make us feel very interesting.</p>
<p>The humanization of courtship in the animal kingdom can be represented by several types of birds. For example, the ruff is a polygamous bird; the pigeon adopts monogamy; the sparrow is a philandering playboy; the egret is a hardcore hero; the male grouse is willing to humble himself to court; the male turkey is not particular about appearance; the oriole uses its singing voice to please the opposite sex; the peacock pursues its lover by flaunting its beauty... There are endless ways to fall in love.</p>
<p>When a little sparrow proposes, it opens its tail, droops its wings, and jumps from left to right, from front to back; at the same time, it opens its throat and sings a marriage proposal. It fully expresses its diligence, patience, and flattery.</p>
<p>What is the exact opposite of the little sparrow is the egret, because it has too much integrity; it only paces back and forth in front of the female bird, without ever looking back. Its reserved and proud attitude indicates that it is definitely not trying to entice its lover with beauty, charm, or magnificence.</p>
<p>The male peacock's tail is the most beautiful, and it relies on its beautiful tail to court. The peacock's wings and feathers are dull in color and not very attractive, so when it courts, it spreads its tail to cover its ugly wings. There is another type of bird called the green luan, which also uses its beautiful tail to court.</p>
<p>The male turkey is exactly the opposite of the peacock and the green luan, and it does not please the opposite sex with beauty. Because when it courts, its wattle becomes particularly swollen and bright red. From an aesthetic point of view, it is certainly not beautiful.</p>
<p>The most unbearable is the male grouse. The male grouse relies on its natural good looks and usually puts on an arrogant and arrogant attitude, but when it comes to courtship, it not only puts on a great show in front of the female bird, but then reveals the ugly state of wagging its tail and begging for pity, because its whole body is prostrate, and its head and neck touch the ground, as if kneeling down.</p>
<p>The ruff is a believer in heroism because it uses duels to win the favor of beauties.</p>
<p>When a male hummingbird courts the opposite sex, it is almost a purely poetic action. At first, it surrounds her, swinging like a pendulum, making a semi-arc-shaped flight. Then, with special affection, it raises the two ends of the arc; however, suddenly, it rushes straight up, about sixty feet; finally, it suddenly falls down, stops in the air, and appears in front of her like a shining diamond.</p>
<p>There is a type of bird in Australia called the gardener bird, and its courtship capital is building a beautiful nest. This nest is made of stones and grass stems and decorated with feathers of various colors. When courting, it stands at the door with a beautiful stone in its mouth to lure the female bird.</p>
<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>The Literary and Artistic Cultivation of Miss America</p>
<p>Americans are inherently a nation that loves literature and art. China was originally the oldest country of culture and education in the world, but now the customs have changed. China is in a time of war, with killings filling the fields and blood floating pestles, while Americans are instead laying down their arms and promoting culture, especially women, who all have cultivation in literature and art. This is of course largely due to the promotion of education, but it is also because the country is prosperous and the people are wealthy that they have the leisure to devote themselves to poetry, literature, music, and books. American women spend several hours a day working to make a living, and the rest of their time is almost entirely spent on literature and art. They have various poetry societies, author associations, music concerts, drama associations, and art exhibitions. Their literary and artistic cultivation is multifaceted, not just proficient in one field. Those who join the author association are also members of other groups. They engage in writing in their spare time from work and housework, and most of them write romance novels, which are first published in local newspapers, then reprinted in magazines, and then published as separate books by publishing houses. One manuscript is sold three times, and the income is quite substantial. Many of them have become famous, and their works have been adopted by Hollywood as film scripts, such as Amber Forever. The film rights alone are $500,000. If it is staged in the theater, there are separate royalties each time. Publishing a book will solve the problem of life, and $500,000 is more than enough to spend for a lifetime. Most American women can paint oil paintings, and it is not just for the sake of affectation. They do have a good command of it. Art museums in various places display the works of families. The wind of selling books is not as commercialized as in China. The scope of occupations in the United States is very wide, and it is not necessary to rely on selling to make a living. Therefore, Americans do not completely regard works of art as commodities. In fact, almost all Americans can paint a few strokes. They have the interest of appreciation, but not the appetite for buying. Moreover, buying and selling were formerly the style of painters and calligraphers, but now it is the habit of the nouveau riche. There are very few nouveau riche in the United States, so the sales of paintings are quite narrow. They also often hold exhibitions, and the purpose is not to promote works, but to appreciate and compare their own works with those of others. You can see middle-aged and elderly women in the venue, standing in front of each painting, holding a magnifying glass in one hand and admiring the famous paintings in front of their eyes, while the authors also treat them cordially and do not promote their own works, or tempt people to buy their works with flowery words. The association provides coffee and refreshments free of charge, but you have to pay to buy a catalog when you enter, from two and a half to one dollar, which is enough to cover the expenses and have a surplus. In addition to poetry, painting, and calligraphy, the piano is something that any woman can play. After tea and wine, playing a song on the piano is such a pleasant family environment and a good remedy for musical temperament. Many Shanghai women entrust their entire lives to waltzes and luminous cups. They not only need to read, paint, and learn poetry, but also know how to paint and understand music, and being a modern woman is not just about lipstick and stockings.</p>
<h3>Ji Xiaolan</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming - Biography of Qing People, No. 2</p>
<p>In the 37th year of Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries was opened, and books from all over the world were sought. It took more than ten years to complete, with a total of more than 36,000 volumes. The Wenyuan, Wenchao, Wenjin, Wenyuan (these are the four inner court pavilions), Wenhui, Wenzong, and Wenlan seven pavilions were built to store them. It is truly a great crystallization of the academic community in our country. The person in charge of this was Ji Wenda.</p>
<p>His name was Yun, his courtesy name was Xiaolan, and his other courtesy name was Chunfan. He was from Hejian and was precocious. When reading, he could read several lines at a glance. When sitting in a dark room at night, his eyes flickered like electricity, and he could see things without a candle. When his knowledge greatly expanded, his light also converged. In the Qianlong reign, he was nominated as a Jinshi. He served as Governor-General five times and Minister of Rites three times. In the tenth year of Jiaqing, he was appointed Associate Grand Secretary and granted the title of Junior Tutor to the Heir Apparent. He died in February of that year at the age of eighty-two.</p>
<p>He was proficient in everything and was especially good at the Han version of the Book of Changes. All his life's energy was devoted to the abstracts and catalog of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, and he no longer wrote his own works. However, he occasionally wrote novels and unofficial histories, such as Notes from the Thatched Abode of Close Observations. He was fond of humor and was like the Eastern Manqing. Once, he was on duty at the Hanlin Academy when it was suddenly reported that the Emperor had arrived in disguise. All the officials sat upright with solemn expressions. He dared not see the Emperor because he was bare-chested, so he hid under the bed. After a while, the room was silent. He then poked his head out to look, and he saw a person sitting with his back to the window, reading documents. He thought it was a colleague and immediately asked, "Has the old man left?" The person was furious and ordered him to come out, and it turned out to be the Emperor himself. He was very flustered and kowtowed, begging for death. The Emperor rebuked him, saying, "A Hanlin official who is bare-chested has already violated the court's orders. How much more guilty is he for calling the Emperor 'old man' behind his back?" He kowtowed and said, "The old man is the great elder of the world. The head is the origin of the human body, and 'zi' is a beautiful name for a man. Putting them together are all terms of praise. I know my crime, and I beg for death." The Emperor then ordered him to write a composition on the spot. When it was finished, the Emperor was pleased and pardoned him. His life was full of similar incidents. Talented literati often have unrestrained behavior. Isn't he one of those?</p>
<h3>The First Traitor</h3>
<p>In history, the first traitor should be Cao Wushang, who was the Left Sima of Duke Pei. When Duke Pei was in Ba Shang, Cao sent someone to inform King Xiang, saying, "Duke Pei wants to be King of Guanzhong and make Ziying the prime minister. All the treasures are in his possession." Therefore, Duke Pei and King Xiang had the scene of the Hongmen Banquet.</p>
<p>However, the ancestor of this traitor was not as lucky as the traitors of today. Duke Pei learned of this matter from King Xiang and killed him immediately upon returning to the army. - Li Renzhong</p>
<h3>The Language of Drinking</h3>
<p>— Sigou</p>
<p>At a banquet once, I said that I couldn't drink alcohol, and I could only drink half a cup. Who knew that my words were interpreted by the host as me being able to drink a lot, even if I didn't have a large capacity. That night, I got drunk because of the host's strong persuasion. This is not surprising, what I find surprising is how my words caused the host to misunderstand me.</p>
<p>After that drunken experience, I became cautious. Whenever I attend a banquet, I tell the host that I have a stomach problem and cannot drink alcohol, as instructed by the doctor. Moreover, in order to make the host believe me, I told him that even if I drank a drop, my stomach would hurt. This is a lie, and according to the citizen's textbook, it shouldn't be said, but these words sound like my true situation to the host. "This guy eats half a cup, it doesn't matter, let's not force him." So, I finished the matter with half a cup while answering politely and expressing respect. Sometimes I hate others for lying when I go out to work, because of this incident, I am afraid of wrongly accusing people; maybe liars also have their own compelling reasons.</p>
<p>After attending more banquets, I slowly discovered that the language of drinking is a branch of the national language, and it makes a lot of sense. The host saying that there are no dishes is not the truth; he may be hinting that there are two specially made dishes that no other restaurant in the city has, but after you praise them for a while (maybe it's true, maybe it's not), he firmly says that the dishes are not well made. The guest with a large capacity for alcohol who cannot drink freely says, "Today, I am borrowing flowers to offer to the Buddha and clearing the customs for the host." In this way, if he loses, he can get his wish. Drinking is also the most snobbish. Today, if you are an important guest, your capacity will be good, and people will respect you and persuade you. If you are a casual guest or your status is not obvious, you can't drink much alcohol even if you have a large capacity, unless a big shot asks you to be a "food storage," then you will have the opportunity to pour cup after cup into your mouth like a clown, and you may even be praised.</p>
<p>There is a type of person who comes from a business background, with little alcohol and a lot of talk. He can talk and laugh, his voice is loud, and he is unreasonable or only talks about brute force. If he doesn't drink, he simply has no right to speak and sits coldly on the side, but those who can talk don't need to drink much at all. He can call you brother and put on the identity of a brother, coaxing and scaring you to drink. There is no distinction between high and low at the banquet, and people can be informal, or he can call you uncle and "kneel" the wine glass (that is, put it upside down) in front of you. He can make a pitiful appearance and ask others to help him "step down." If you insist on not drinking, and the host respects you, he can say that you are not giving face to the host. Sometimes he quotes classics and sometimes he uses both literary and military tactics, and as a result, you have to drink. In this kind of occasion, it is best to admit defeat and remain silent. They argue that you ate less than him and refuse to let go, making people doubt whether drinking is pleasure or pain. If it is said to be pleasure, why use so much tongue; if it is said to be pain, what is the purpose of the host inviting guests? I think the occurrence of this phenomenon is entirely because there are few opportunities for public speaking in China, so those with good eloquence have nowhere to show their skills. They can only seek it at banquets.</p>
