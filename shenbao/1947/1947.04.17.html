<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕中宣部十六日記者會彭部長答記者問。茲誌其問答於次：</p>
<p>問：外國飛機倘事前未獲允准而飛過中國領空，則中國防空部隊，對之作何處置？能將防空部隊所接永久訓令之內容見告否？是否在任何情形之下，均准許射擊或僅在某種情形之下，方得射擊，或對於某種型式之軍用機如戰斗機，驅逐機，轟炸機，方得射擊？</p>

<h3>強化經濟行政的必要</h3>
<p>現階段的我國經濟，無疑地，還在緊急狀態之中，二月十六日所通過的經濟緊急措施方案，便是一個很明顯的例證。加以各機關的對立，無論在中央，在地方，其形態都很顯著。有權則相爭，有過則相諉，這種習慣，本來是政治上一個不易割治的癌。况且公文往復，亂兜圈子，又是官僚們一貫的作風。所以經濟行政權的統一和筒化，在我國現階段的經濟上，實在有此需要。</p>
<p>不看見許多極通常的案件嗎？從甲機關轉到乙，從乙機關再批到丙，如此轉輾周折，互相推托，有時還須經過開會，審核，調查，請示，這一類程序，要得到一個空言的批復，已往往需要好幾個星期的日子，等到要實際行動時，所有各有關機關，又須再經過一套類此的手續，日子久了，所有時效，往往因此消失。一般商民對於這等情形，大家覺得十分頭痛，在政府方而，也未嘗無此感覺，所以不斷地喊着。要簡化手續，要提高效率。</p>
<p>現在中央早已設有全國經濟委員會，為一切經濟行政之最高的指導機關，也是一個綜合性的機關。按照這個組織，各個經濟行政部門，原可由此獲致密切的聯繫，和分工合作的效果。假如疊床架屋，再加上一個類此的機關，轉使統一與簡化的作用上，反增多一重障礙。與原來的意思，豈非背道而馳嗎？不過話雖如此，我們為實現統一興簡化這項作用，直接提高經濟上的行政效率，間接促進生產事業起見，却不得不希望各個經濟行政機關設法改進，儘量她發揮其功能。</p>
<p>怎樣才可以達到上項目的呢？我們認為：第一，應减少層層管理的機構。例如最近所擬劃消各金融機構的職機，使他們分頭發展，而取消四聯總處，或將他作為諮詢機構，這便是一個實例。第二，應取消名實不符的管理機構，例如燃料管理委員會，實際上並不能把握住物資，也不能充分地供應民用，却限制了媒商，不許他們自由採運，實在似乎不甚合理。第三應裁併一切重複機構。這在中央和地方，都不難找到例證，如果能分別性質，設法裁併，不但可以統一事權，從根本上减少周折和推諉的弊病，也可以節省經費，减輕財政上的負擔。第四，應减少各種有關的委員會。委員會的優點固多，而弱點亦復不少，如遲緩，推諉，不負責等等皆是，於執行上，其弊尤為顯著。第五，應整理法令，剔除其矛盾或重複的規定。現在各項經濟法令，（一）有頒行於戰前或戰時的，其於現在情形，顯然不甚適合，例如所定罰鍰或手績費等，為數實在太覺輕微。（二）有業經廢止或呆擱，而重復加以援用的，如工商團體的强制入會令，與運同經濟緊急措施方案所頒諸法令是。（三）有未及制定或已制定而未及施行的，如房屋租賃條例最低工資法等。社會經濟，本隨時代而演進，一切有關法令，如不能適應環境，切合事實，則施行時，難免發生困難，結果便要影響到政策的推行了。</p>
<p>語云，徒法不能以自行，任何法令，制度，如果沒有人去切實執行，那末，縱有良法美意，也無非等於廢紙，所以最重要的一點，還在於各部門能吾實心任事，切實去推動。只要有人認眞辦理，確實負責，則法令縱不具備，亦自可以逐漸修補，而一切推諉，敷衍等弊，便不至到處發生。上文所舉行政統一與簡化的功效，其關鍵不外乎是。非但經濟行政如是，其他一切行政，亦無不如是。</p>
<p>我們所以特別要求强化經濟行政，共一，固由於當前經濟情形的嚴重，其二，還是由於這項需要的日形密切，這也可以從兩方面加以說明。一是政府自身的需要，如各種管制，限制，配售，配給，國營事業等，都要各方面的配合和聯緊，以求順利完成其所負之使命。一是工商方面的需要。就勞工而言，連一二個人的解雇，支薪等事故，已需要當地官廳的支持和處理。如果不予接受，則星星之火，很可能鬧成風潮。至於從事生產的商人，所需要的政府助力更多。諸如金融之周轉，外匯之供給，原料之取得，動力之維持，乃至製品如何推銷，運輸如何流通，外貨傾銷如何應付，甚至副產品如何運銷，生產機械如何購辦等等，莫不需要政府的扶助或斡旋。髣髴今日的政府，已成了工商界的總管理處一般，這並不是偶然的事情。因為從農業經濟漸漸進入於工業生產，官與商間的關係，當然日趨緊複。况値此非常時期，工商業已入半管制狀態。按照評議物價，評議工資，取締國積，農工商礦管理乃至無數的登記等法令，幾乎每一種重要的行動，都要經過報吿，核准的手續。所以經濟行政的組織和人事，如果不能力求强化，以適應此迫切的需要，則商民的苦痛，固然無法解除，而國家的經濟政策，亦勢必悉成具文，無注切實推行，那是顯而易見的了。</p>
<h3>蘇北間印象記（四）　百姓熱望「青天」來</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　章繩治</p>
<p>談到地方行政，亦是件頭痛的事。這年頭做縣長，挨駡容易討好難。不過老百姓還是慹望着有一個「靑天」來。</p>
<p>縣長說起來，撤頭第一句總是百廢徒舉，經費不足，巧婦難為無米之炊。可是老百姓呢，又是說捐稅太重，預算龐大，實在不堪負担。在第三者聽起來，亦確是公說公有理，婆說婆有理，各有各的困難。其實歸根結底一句話，在此七分軍事三分政治的情况下，縣長固然難做，老百姓亦是不得了。</p>
<p>我們早就說過，蘇北各縣最大的毛病，在於下層工作不健全，往往上面一個好計劃，行到下面己經七折八却，完全走了樣。</p>
<p>這裏可以舉一個例，省府要想配合武化蘇北，曾經下過命令鼓勵人民購槍。這一個動機，原是一個好計劃，可是一到地方上，老百姓無形中用錢又出命，攬得有舌難說。如皐縣府曾經用三十五萬元的價目奉命出賣過三百枝槍，可是市面上的黑市價却要賣到八十萬元到一百萬元，一根　機槍價値就要高到一千萬元。</p>
<p>好的鄉長，往往因為不肯太違背良心，事情辦不通，素性溜之大吉，因此地方上常常農得羣記無首，而聽任一些地痞流氓乘機而起，魚肉鄉民。更往往給共軍利用這些無知小民，佈下了情報網，這對軍事上更是一個重大的打擊。</p>
<p>地方上的惡勢力，實在對辦理地方行政的一個大障碍，這裏可以拿海門縣來作為「首席代表」，雖然這個三等縣，在面積上和人口上都不及其他各縣，可是這個「彈丸之城」的小市民，却先有了「東派」和「西派」之分，並且各有各的背景，各有各的發言人，　　怒駡，無時無刻不在明爭暗關之中。</p>
<p>據說全江蘇省過去的訴訟案件，以海門縣佔居第一位，同時過過去的許多海門縣長，沒有一個不是軋扁了頭才下台的。</p>
<p>聽說現在全省各縣都巳成立了臨參會，惟獨海門縣尙未組織，預料今後「東派」和「西派」免不了又有一番大爭執。</p>
<p>海門縣長曾經對記者很感慨的說過：「我到任雖然短短幾個月，大部份時間倒是替地方上人士作着排難解紛的事情」。由他這句話，我們不難體味到海門地方情形的複雜性來。</p>
<p>這次記者團跑了四個縣，除了南通縣長是蘇北東台人外，其餘海門如臯東台三個縣的縣長，都是湖南人。我們從民間一般人的口氣中，大家還不免存些地方觀念。同時這幾位縣長過去都是在軍隊中做過工作，在配合軍事上說，應該是比較適宜一些。</p>
<p>其中如皐縣的簡縣長，和李司令官是長沙同鄉，過去就是綏靖司令部的機要室主任，並且亦是新聞界一個「編輯先生」出身，談鋒健，精明而能幹，與記者們大談其土地政策，滔滔而不絕。他對蘇聯的集證農塲制，特別感覺興趣濃厚，據他自已說’他在做縣長之前，肅着實實的在書本上研究過相當時期。當我們離開如皐之前，還特地印了一本「如皐縣永安合作農塲開闢墾田計劃畫」，內中有圖表，有說明，令人看了一目瞭然。如果這事眞的做成功了，當然是一件很好的工作，不過令人担憂的，照現在這種情勢，似乎決不能像理想中那樣容易。</p>
<p>這次我們在各縣之問，走馬看花的跑了一個大圈，除了耳聞目見的事情外，還收到了負責當局的許多報吿書和印刷品，積起來厚的一大包。一切的計劃，當然都是好的，但是要想發生效果，這當然又是另一回事。</p>
<p>最後引用李司令官一句話：「一切決定在幹部」。</p>
<p>「單有軍事而無政治，徒使人民多受痛苦」。</p>

<h3>外長會議已臨最後階段　馬歇爾會晤史達林　各方對談話內容猜測紛紜</h3>
<p>〔法國執聞社莫斯科十五日電〕美國國務　馬歇爾元帥於本日午後十時，晋謁史達林元帥，相與談話，美國駐蘇大使史密斯，美國國務院帮辦波倫曁蘇聯外長英洛托夫時亦在座。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十五日合衆電〕美國務卿馬歇爾，與譴責蘇聯應對外長會議不能獲致基本協定負責後，頃已將美蘇對於四强公約之爭執，提交史達林總理，馬歇爾係於午後十時抵克里姆林宮，渠令其僚屬，勿向報界宜佈渠與史達林會談之詳情。美代表團報界聯絡秘書德謨所能發表者，即馬歇爾於晚十時抵克里姆林宮，並於晚十一時四十五分返抵大使館，其他有悶會晤之各點，均無所悉。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十六日廣播；馬歇爾與史達林會談之結果，雙方嚴守秘密，此問外交家均表示悲觀，彼等認為此次會談，證明外長會議已屆由窮水盡之階段。馬史會談若無結果，外長會議必將立即結束。繼之而來者，必為各强在歐之更為對立與仇視。又訊：美國新聞處蘇聯分處處長威立斯因有親蘇嫌疑，被迫辭職。據稱，駐蘇美大使及其部下極端反蘇，致使兩國無法接近，關於此點，美大使史密斯已予以吾認。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十六日廣播、據悉馬歇爾與史達林昨夜會談歷時九十分鐘，結果並未打開四强外長會議各項問題所造成之僵局。就馬氏之立塲而論，此次談話之主要價値，厥在馬氏以美國對德政策向蘇聯元首，作坦白率直之聲述而已。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕「每日電聞報」頃載有莫斯科訪員來電，暗示美國務卿馬歇爾殆曾要求謁見史達林，俾可向之表示對莫斯科會議一無成就之遺憾，幷順便向之辭行。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十五日電〕國務院人士今晚對於史達林元帥與馬歇爾國務卿之會晤，雖拒不發表意見，以待莫斯科方面之詳細報吿，但美國外交界人士相信兩氏不但討論德國問題，且討論有關美蘇關係之全部問題。半官方面稱：馬歇爾倘曾要求訪晤史達林元帥，定必認為時機適台。一般印象認為馬帥雖出言缓慢，但一小時又三刻鐘之時間，亦足以使其向史帥表明美國政府之見解，即阻碍莫斯科會議進展者，乃為蘇聯代表團之態度，並表明杜魯門主義之特徵，限度與實際結果。華盛頓人士力言馬鄉為「直接外交方法」之信仰者，蘇聯人士方面因駐美大使諾維柯夫去不在，亦拒絕發表意見。但接近蘇聯大使館人士唯恐美蘇兩國之紛歧過大，史馬會晤後未必能產生兩國關係立即改善之希望云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十五日電〕關於馬歇爾元帥晋謁史達林元帥事，頃由此問政治觀察家加以評論稱：觀於馬帥要求晋謁史帥，可知四國外長會議已至最危急之時期。此二政治家之談話，可以決定外長會議之久暫及其成敗。惟蘇聯外長莫洛托夫對於美國四强公約草案，已提出對案，足使美國草案歸於失敗。其實在馬帥對於此種困難，早已料及，良以渠所要求者，僅要求四强對於美國建議在原則上予以答覆而巳故也。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫提出修正案　四強公約遭擱淺　美蘇意見不一顯易見</h3>
<p>〔路透社要斯科十五日電〕馬歇爾今日稱：莫洛托夫對余所提四强防德公約案之修正案，足以完全變更本約之範圍及宗旨，草洛托夫建議修正該約，使其得以涉及其他事項，如肅淸納粹之永久政權，消滅托辣斯，及完成賠償物之收集等。此等事項，應由盟管會或和平條約處理，在四强公約中予以規定，將變更該公約之範團及宗旨云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十五日電〕四國外長本日舉行會議，美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥作最後之努力，企圖使外長會議立即開始討論四强公約，但遭蘇聯之堅決反對。以是美國之建議，已吿無限期擱淺。四強意見不能一致，已屬顯而易見。關於煤斤問題，馬帥聲明，在德國經濟統一未曾實現之前，盟國管制委員會有效管制煤斤之生產與分配，決不可能。法國外長比杜爾亦發表聲明，評諭英，美，蘇三國外長，對於法國就魯爾區所提建議之態度。</p>
<h3>英派大員赴蘇　商南方人貿易問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十五日電〕英棄務大臣克利浦斯緬告下議院稱：蘇聨元首史太林已同意英蘇兩國代表進行商業談判。克氏宣稱：英對外貿易大臣威邇斯將於十八日飛莫斯科，交換英蘇兩國間未來商業之意見，英國亟需自外國輸入原料如木材等，在戰前木材乃來自美蘇兩國，同時蘇聯似希望自英國獲得機器及設備，作復興蘇聯之用。</p>
<h3>對奧和約　可能成立協議</h3>
<p>〔合眾社莫斯科十五日電）四國外長會議明日議程為對奧和約問題，此為尙未經外長全體會義討諭之題目，衆倍四强會議費時五星期後，對此或能成立相當之協議云。</p>
<h3>美一議員主張　美蘇立即絕交</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕密西西比州民主黨議員倫金今日在衆議院中主張美國立即與蘇聯斷絕外交關係。</p>
<h3>美蘇租借賬目　即將開始談判</h3>
<p>蘇應付賬款較他國為多</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕官方負責人士今日談稱：美蘇二國關於一百十四億餘美元軍備租借賬目之清算，遷延已久，一日進行談判，蘇方應付服款將較其他盟國為互。其故旣非由於美蘇二國對目前世界問題之爭執，亦非由於克里姆林宮年來拒絕蹉商淸算所致，蓋因蘇聯獲得民用式物資校其他盟國為多。在其他盟國方面，美國戰時渡洋傾入用以擊敗納粹之五百億美元供應物資中，美方業已同意。按照每元不足三角比率償還。但預料蘇聯將按較大比率付款。至於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫對美國建議所提修正辦法不能接受。</p>
<h3>巴西共產青年　奉令停止活動</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴西京城十五日電〕巴西總統杜特拉，本日命令共產主義靑年運動，停止活動半年。</p>
<h3>杜魯門咨文國會　要求修正中立法　禁止軍火運往侵略國家</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕杜魯門總統自提出其「檢騐共產疫病」之建議後，頃復以特別咨文送達國會，要求授權禁止美國軍備及戰爭物資運往有侵略意向之國家，幷要求修改一九三九年之中立法，略謂：美國軍火決不能再落入可能成為敵國之手中，倘戰爭迫在眉睫，而吾國仍處於現在之狀態中，受本身法令之約束，可對或將發動進攻之國家，予以援助，則將成為難以容忍之局面。余茲提出此項建議，乃在阻止軍火之貿易，漫無限制，以免再造成因援助日本而發生之珍珠港事件云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕權威方面本日就杜魯門總統所提修改中立法禁止軍火運往侵略國之事發表意見稱，杜魯門之新建議表示在其他國家發生戰爭時，美國未必一定採取完全不偏不倚之途徑，但將斷絕美國向任何侵略國家之援助。杜魯門並未表明將受軍火禁令所打擊之國家，但意義所在，似專指蘇聯及其東歐附席國，此等國家所採取之政策，曾為代理國務卿艾克　斥為「有侵略性及擴展主義』之政微波云，</p>
<h3>阿拉伯委員會</h3>
<p>將派代表至中國等地</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社耶路撤冷十六日電〕阿拉伯最高委員會巳決定嚴造代表前往中國，印度，伊朗。土耳其，法國，蘇聯，英國，西班牙與史干蒂那雜亞各國，以便表示阿拉伯人對巴勒斯坦問題之意見，赴北美之代表業已任命，定下星期啟程。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約十六日電〕雷諾乘機係由靑年機師奧登盟駛，今日抵此間機塲後，偕五十四齡之雷諾與副機師賽利出機登右翼時，塲內羣衆衝破警察防綫，意湧向前，熱烈歡迎，婦女更爭與三人接吻，良久，打開道路，雷諾方得與大人愛特娜相會。奧登與夫人相見時，奔躍如飛。賽利則與愛人胡莉漢熱烈擁抱，胡女士芳齡十九，定於今夜成婚，賽利在飛行途中會電胡女士作此要求</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十五日電〕雷諾飛抵紐約時，有詢以雷諾及機師兩人短期內將作何事，正機師奧登答「腫覺」，雷諾答「吃和　」，副機師賽利答「吃。　和結婚」。</p>

<p>〔合衆社紐約十五日電〕倫敦消息：美前商務部長華萊士現正在結束其英國之行程，準備前往斯干蒂那維亞與法國繼績從事演講運動。華氏並表示國會對其抨擊，益使其抱定發表言論之決心，以抨擊美國推行足以引起美蘇戰爭之政策。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十六日廣播：美國會人物繼續指責華萊士在國外之活動，認為華氏「危害本國」，應吊銷其護照，取消其美國公民資格。</p>
<h3>對華氏言論英表示態度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊日廣播：英外部今就華萊士在英活動事發表聲明，據稱華氏係以私人資格游英，對其一切言論，英政府不能接受任何責任。華氏在英活動，僅獲得一部份文化人士之同情，絕不影響英方外交政策。</p>

<h3>囤積食米二千餘名　元藏米行經理被捕　乘市塲到貨稀少居奇一再抬價　凌德孚將送法院究辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警備司令部連日出動大批員警，協助市政府監察市塲，抑平物價。昨日該部接獲密報，鳳陽路三四四弄六號元茂米行高抬市價，並囤積食米二千餘石，當經交由警察局行政處第四科派員偵查後，將該行經理凌德孚逮捕，帶至警局審問。凌對囤積抬價一節，矢口否認，現本案已移由警察局刑事處繼續偵訊中。緣本月九日，北市塲米價暴漲，該凟德孚於是日持有黎里米十餘船，約計二千餘石。凌見當日市場到貨稀少，即抬高售價至每石十三萬七千元。且猶不願大批拋售。翌日，凌又擬續抬高售價，經該市塲管理主任徐頌仁之勸說，始勉强允予維持九日原　。經濟檢察當局接獲此項密吿後，極爲震怒，以此次米價暴漲，雖係產地價格報漲及到貨稀少所致，惟該凌德孚竟敢趁機抬高市價，執貨不售，刺激人心，實屬不法。乃於昨日下令拘捕，將於日內移送地院依法嚴懲。</p>

<p>秘密調查，但始終未有所獲，乃於十四日傳方義弼來局訊問，方否認係共產黨黨員。更無任組長之事，亦不識王藻華其人，再訊王藻華，亦無所發現。惟方義弼稱；彼於月前亦曾接獲一僅署名『圓』字之匿名信，汚衊其女友李鈺英，後經查明該信係其女友之另一男朋友曹仲麗所寫，</p>

<h3>漢城足球隊　初遭滑鐵盧　二比零敗於鐵路</h3>
<p>韓國漢城足球遠征軍來滬第二仗，昨日下午五時仍在逸園與鐵路隊作戰，戲衆未如理想之多，約計八千餘人，惟韓僑及鐵路助威者甚衆，熱烈情緒，不亞於首塲，鐵路賴三軍用命，竟以二比〇克服韓軍，殊出意外，上半時鐵睡中二球，下半時未開紀錄。漢城隊經騐不足，大意輕敵，卒遭敗挫。</p>
<p>鐵路</p>

<p>一分半鐘鐵路破門</p>
<p>開賽前，雙方合攝一影後，鐵路體育會會長王兆槐氏，贈予客軍錦旗一方，兩軍隊長張渠與林暢植握手相見。五時正正式開賽，客軍獲球先攻，安鍾秀左角試射，張渠輕輕接住，遙傳前方，蕭子文派司左角，李垚於離門八十碼處遙傳中央，不意球出過高，且洪德詠視綫被陽光所遮，遂被跳入網內，一比〇。鐵路首開紀錄，時距開賽僅一分半鐘。</p>
<p>連失二球漢城再陷</p>
<p>漢城反攻未獲成就，十二分鐘時客軍後衛於三十碼處救球心切，以手吻球，費春華罰球，蕭子文門前等候，加上一脚，洪德詠目瞪口呆，球已入綱，二比零客軍再敗一城。三十五分鐘時，漢城隊見勢不佳，調上鄭國振與鄭南湜，惟戰局始終爲鐵路控制，上半時完畢，錢路以二比零佔先。</p>
<p>互施攻擊各無建樹</p>
<p>檸檬再戰，漢城反攻，鐵路門將張渠，左檔右接，一一救駕。十分鐘時，鐵路否極泰來，進攻猛烈，亦未得手。至十八分鐘時，鐵路後衛徐晟沅離塲休息，由曹禮明入塲庖代，是時鐵將後防要地，突趨緊張，二十分鐘時，鄭國振於鐵路門前八碼人叢中射門，奈球運不佳，竟中橫木彈出。客軍此球不進，命也運也。混戰至二十八分鐘時。費春華陸慶祥，一搭一擋，又施攻　，均爲敵衛救出。李垚射門球出如飛，惜乎稍偏尺許。距終塲前八分鐘時，客軍再度來犯奈鐵路傾全力於守，徒喚奈何。漢城隊卒以二比零受挫。</p>

<p>連日黑市價格猖獗　紗市籌碼見稀少　紗商業公會暫行停止申請入會　　〔本報訊〕近來以黑市棉紗行市，與紡建公司之掛牌價，日見撥開。一般紗號能在紡盤公司開得棉紗一件，單憑准購單轉手，即可坐獲鉅額差益。更有少數生產商人，利用黑市，將原料轉讓，藉以牟利。據悉：日來紗市籌碼稀少，賴此輩調劑者頗多。而一般紗號擔客，以承購後交由客帮北銷，每件仍可獲致相當利潤，亦樂於軍進。　　昨棉紗市况塲外喊價步挺未巳，在投議奸商壟斷情勢下，籌碼甚稀，喊價雖挺而頗有缺乏做開之勢。計四十二支藍鳳升至一〇五〇萬，二十支特雙馬五七〇萬元，雙為價五四〇萬元。　　近來向紗商業公會申請登記入會者又見增加。據悉：該會現巳登記之會員，已達七三八家。惟實際開業者，僅約六百家。此中眞正業紗商者不過二百家。其餘大多係紗布兼營或掮客等所組設。而在紡建公司登記領得配紗權者，不過三百餘家。該會為謀協助當局管理紗價事宜，及辦理已向該會申請入會之調查工作，曁整理已入會之各項事務起見，自十五日起，已暫行停止申請入會。至已領申請書而尙未塡送到會者，則限於三日內送會，逾期亦暫行停止申請入會云。　　紡建公司售紗經過　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司業務處某負責人，須為該公司迭次循例配售紗布情形，有所說明。渠稱：半月來本市紗布價格節節上漲，而該公司開售棉紗價格，恪遒當局規定，迄未變更。開售布疋價格，亦較市低廉。且該項紗布之配售，亦從未間歇。歷次配售數量，亦均保持平衡。惟市價漲無止境，致與該公司掛牌價之差額，日見擴大。按照目前之差額而言，該公司每售紗一次，照市價差額計算，約少收二三十億元。每售布一次，約少收六七億元。此項少收之差額，悉為中間商所漁利而去，於直接之消費者，並無補助，於國庫又屬　　損失。而外界不明眞相，反常　紡建公司拋售不力。渠復列奉自四月一日迄十五日，各日紡建公司開售紗布價格，較市價低　之金額為參考。以廿支紗言，每件各日之差價，二日卅五萬元，四日四十萬元，七日七十五萬元，九日七十八萬元，十一日七十五萬元，十四日一百五十五萬元。以四十二支綫言，每件各日之差價，二日一百廿萬元，四日于百萬一元，七日一百五十萬元，九日一百五十五萬元，十一日一百五十五萬元，十四日二百八十五萬元。以十二磅細布每疋各日之差價言，一日四千五百元，三日五千元，五日六千五百元，八日一萬八千元，十日一萬五千元，十二日二萬六千元，十五日二萬七千元。　　紡建售紗　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡管會售紗，共售二三〇二件，內廠商一九七五件，紗號三二七件。申請共一六一〇戶，內廠商一二八三戶，紗號三二七戶。　　奚玉書氏發表談　　〔本報訊〕最近社會人士對紗價高漲及原棉供應不足，深表關切，記者特詢之奚王書氏，據云：棉紗之收購價格與廠家自由出售價格，應力求其接近，否則廠家高抬自由售價，以圖抵償因收購價格過低而發生之損失，不論政府收購之用途如何，直接間接對於物價均有不良影響。至於合理之收購價格，可列一式如下：三擔半原棉十一百四十萬元之製造成本十五％之統稅＝每收購之合理價格。至於原棉之供給，自去年九月份起，本市棉紡業人員即大聲疾呼，並與經濟部王部畏洽商，希望政府能未雨綢繆。至去年十月吳市長兼長紡管會後，棉紡界人士又要求政府保證原棉不斷供給，但至今年二月為止，在此半年之內，政府並未訂購外棉，此在政府言，自有其實際之困難，但為整個國民經濟起見，希望當局高瞻達矚，能有一整個之方案。至於聯德接濟之棉花，共計十六萬包，已運抵本埠者約五萬包。統債平穩　　公債昨丙穩雜疲，統丙晨開一三〇〇〇元，高價一四二〇〇元，低價一二七〇〇元，量後頗為穩定。五一二室及散戶有納，四〇八室四〇三室則出，收後塲外稍穩，結果較前收計雜牌甲乙丁戊各降五百元至九百元不等，統丙則回升四百元，成交約五百萬。證劵帮脫手外股趨下游　　外股昨以證券帮之脫手不已，且港市並無進展，盤旋而疲。怡紗自晨初高價四一五〇〇元起，午後退至三九〇〇〇元左右結束。餘股除電話會德豐所跌有限外，均亦下游，尤以小股為甚。結果較前收計航業怡啤跌一成半，紙業跌一成，會德鑒電話微挫，餘均下落半成强。多空雙方角逐華股起伏靡定　　華股昨在掉期前夕，雙方角逐甚烈，證券中多頭幾有傾巢而出之勢，大戶　某及外灘帮廣帮等，乘低頗加支助，低後頗費掙扎。　　晨開　　再見高昂，景福依然漲達限度，淮仍在塲外成交價之下甚多。水泥由四號售予二四號一個單位，亦屬漲停價，人心甚好。九七號一八五號八九號乘高費出，遞交永紗開後自三九五〇元回落至三八七〇元，四號一四五號七六號八七號九九號有納，升為三九二〇元。一四號二三一號一五六號二三二號三五號四五號二二四號八九號奮力脫手，而退至三七九〇元。一六五號九一號七三號二一八號尙進，升為三八五〇元，九九號一二號一八六號一七一號一六三號一五二號一四五號陸續力售，逐步將遞永紗迫低至三七二〇元。八九號一九八號五四號曾進至三八〇〇元外，一一七號一六三號一七一號等仍來了結，再退八三七一〇光景。二一八號四號等見低維持，午收尙見穩健。結果較前收計永紗美亞華豐新光微降，勤興跌半成，新華降一成，景福漲停，信和升半成强。遞交計永紗華豐新光微降，美亞勤興降半成，信和漲半成弱。冷股水泥漲停後急回，軋升半成，統益新亞跌一成，永公中紡跌半成，五和漲一成，餘者升降不一。　　午後　　祗　即交，承午收後之餘勢，現永紗開高至三八五〇元。一七一號一九八號一八三號一八五號一五三號一六三號四號一四五號二三一號一一七號九九號一五四號六九號連續猛售。開後即步降至三六五〇元。七六號九四號二二四號進至三六八〇元，但以傳聞津埠禁紗出口，及主席出國等流言，一六三號二三一號一一七號二二四號賣到三六一〇元，二一八號一二號一八三號趁低進至三六六〇元，九九號一四二號二〇七號一七八號一一二號九五號再賣到三六〇〇元一八八號一八五號二二三號一四五號十二六號均納。中法在開做遞交之說下，五九號進至漲停，新亞由八四號買到跌停，因有訴訟案件也。三時後，永紗會升至三六八〇元，一〇七號一一二號二〇七號四號再賣，退為三六一〇元左右，二三五號一九八號二一八號一八八號仍加維持，臨收稍穩。結果較前收計景福中法漲停，勱興祗做前市，軋低半成。新光亦因增資，停止後市，祗吿微挫。永紗跌半成弱，美亞跌一成弱，信和升半成不到。遞交計半天交易，信和升半成弱，美亞勸興降半成，永紗華麗新光微降。冷股新亞跌停後有回，水泥漲停後亦回，計水泥升一成，新亞跌半成，中紡統益各跌一成及成半。五和交易少，尙升一成，榮　亦以成交不多而微升，餘股自微降迄跌半成強不等。塲外各股除中華世界大生外，均再見升。銀樓業代表　再赴市府請願　　全市大小同行銀樓因供求不能平衡，於十四日起再度停止買賣後，該業同業公會方面，於昨日午前再度推派代表往市府亞謁吳市長，陳述該業目前苦衷，要求吳市長轉呈財政部，修改買賣飾金辦法。價格方面能酌予放寬，對禁止收買條塊，亦希望予以取消，否則甚盼中央能以官定價格配售。吳市長當時除對代表等提議極表同情外，允在短期內，韓呈財部訂定妥善辦法云。食糧繼續挺升　社局將改拋白米　中信局允以西貢米撥市府　　〔本報訊〕米市昨受產地價高影響，繼續上挺。南北兩市塲共到貨四千七百五十二石。社會局拋出紅秈二千八百九十包，價每石十二萬零五百元。　　社會局糧食科長吉明齊於昨日下午三時曾晋謁吳市長，請示對抑平米價機宜。據悉：中信局已允日今日起撥交市府中號西貢約三萬至五萬包，供市塲拋售，以抑平漲風。拋售價格待今晨吉科長至市塲後臨時宣佈，當較市價為低，每石約十一萬。社局對米行米商訂有嚴格規定，避免被人國積，使市民能切實受惠。　　洋米即到　　社會局長吳開先昨日吿稱：該局於必要時將拋售白粳，使與紅秈輸流出現於市塲。目前主要癥結，猶在請江蘇省政府切實協助抑平產區價格。四月底洋米可到數萬噸，五月間又將有十萬噸進口。糧食部龐次長已允將一部份撥供滬市需要，以穩定米價。　　白元狂漲　　昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千七百餘石，各產區猛漲不已，　地隨之追蹤激升。粳秈米形成奇貨可居，繼續奔騰五六千元。白元陰地則相繼劇漲萬餘元。　　麺粉節節上漲再加二三千元，麩皮步升一二千元，豆餅去化甚俏，盤漲千餘元。黃豆突飛猛進續見暴漲一萬餘元。生仁南洋去化俏俐，按步疾進，狂奔萬元。芝蔴華南吸收甚濃，飛跳一萬餘元。蠶豆則跟漲三四千元。荼豆華南猛吸之下，續見猛烈上漲一萬餘元。　　赤豆廣銷仍旺，飛騰一萬餘元。小麥物稀為貴，續挺三五千元。靑島紗布飛漲　　〔中央社靑島十六日電〕靑市為產紗布地區，近日各地游資湧來，紗布價格波動甚劇，廿支布每匹漲至廿二萬，紗每件至五百六十萬。據悉上漲原因：（一）因商人外運牟利，上月份膠海關出口棉紗一萬一千餘件，布卅六萬匹，超過靑市產量甚遠。（二）受天津營口等埠紗布飛漲影饗。（三）原棉煤炭五金物料價格，較一月中旬增漲三倍以上，而紗布只漲兩倍。（四）本月初中紡靑分公司，西原棉中斷停錠十萬枝，供不應求，現該公司原棉已到，極力恢復原棉產量，井與靑市府商洽紗布配售暫行辦法，以供市民與綫布斜織工廠及生產合作社需要。　　津禁紗布出口　　〔中央社天津十五日電〕津市紗布價格，兩月來飛漲不巳，市當局為取締投機，十五日已頒佈管制紗布銷售辦法，禁止輸往靑滬。對輸往東北，除中紡還售及准商人具保以布易糧外，亦予禁止，並實行公會議價。國行及中信局　向美訂購烟煤　計五萬噸運輸問題考慮中　　〔本報訊〕據悉：中央銀行及中央信託局，為充實本市湈斤存底，俾於煤斤短細時，調劑供應計，刻已決定向美國及加拿大方面，訂購烟煤五萬噸。該項烟煤價格，如我國自行派輸裝運。在美之净成本價，每噸約在美金二十元以內。如委託美輸裝運，則抵滬價每噸約合美金卅五元，共需動用外匯頭寸，計美金一百七十五萬元。聞該項運輸問題，刻正在考慮中。該項烟煤抵滬後，將暫予堆存，以備緊急時撥出拋售云。　　煤屑續漲　　煤市烟煤屑市勢續趨倘俐，開平一號　價已喊出七十萬元關，烟煤塊亦穩中帶堅，問津者漸多。萎糜多時之鄱樂統煤，亦見振作，價已升至六十七八萬元。白煤各貨市况依然堅穩，市價鮮有漲動。美金公債持劵人　所得外匯可自由匯出　　〔中央社南京十五日電〕據財部發曾人稱：卅六年美金公債條例第五條，明定「本公債本息，由國民政府特定，一律以美金外匯給付」等語。財部業經依照此項元嬰定，與中央銀行及輸入管理委會洽妥，太公債本息之給付，當聽任持券人之便，自由匯出，不予限制。持券人並得以此項外匯，在輸入管理辦法規定範圍內，向國外訂購各種貨物，輸入國內。如其所購為生產工具或生產原料，輸入管理委會尤當予以特別便利。本市銀根見俏　　週來本市銀根不如過去鬆濫，前昨兩日游資稍現活躍，銀根帶倘。據交換所昨日消息：各行莊向國行軋進頭寸為十七億元，較之兩週前軋出十餘億時，已漸抽緊，然比照以往肉國行軋進二百五十億元時，則相差倍展。據悉：此次頭寸略緊原因，物價波動固為因素之一，此外如商號在本月十五日以前，應　付所利得稅，其數不　，亦為一大原因。更據金融事業人士表示：政府對穩定物從申領有決心，銀根當不致過份抽緊，然預料月底以前，以趕進本月份美金庫劵利息關係，購買庫劵自必踴躍，屆時當有大量游資吸收，則銀根抽緊，或較可能。染料疊晉高峯　　連日以某種利多消息剌激之下，雖市銷客銷並不十分繁盛，市價疊晉高峯。昨今市五馬硃，硫化元·水靛等乃扶搖直上，尙無平定可能。五金俏後見平　　運日五金市况，疊見高峯，茲已稍見平穩，，惟鐵絲布，時屆銷令，價仍不斷俏升，鉛絲亦極挺秀。杉木漲勢已戢　　杉木前因閩地產價喊高，且因滬市實銷鬆動，人心振奮，此番漲勢已達一成半，惟昨市漲勢已止，洋松賣方因鑒杉太市價高漲，昨亦看好。碧螺春獻新　　各種內銷茶中，除龍井大方等外，洞庭山所產之碧螺春，亦屬名貴之綠茶。每年向來暢銷本街為數頗多。本年度新貨在各店莊渴望中，始於昨日還滬。聞同業互做價，東山貨每斤開三萬六千元，西山貨每斤為二萬四五千元，售價方面甚為俏俐。至於溫杭兩地之新龍井，以到貨日見蒼老，行情再行軟化。他若內銷陳茶，續因進出相若，不分軒輕。洋莊茶市買戶仍圓抑價，賣方不忍割愛，在此種情形下，交易銳减，情况徘徊如故。荷產奎寗恢復生產　　戰時荷蘭奎寗樹皮不能出口，世界各處俱感缺乏。最近荷政府稱：奎寗樹皮及粗製品，己可供給，今後恢復生產，供

<p>日軍五十萬　被遣送至西伯利亞  本報室特譯　　時間旣侷促，運輸工具又缺乏，蘇軍仍拚命用坦克車拖運精細機器，結果百分之二十遭受了損壞。　　除了著名反蘇份子謝米諾夫等百餘人被槍決或遣送至西伯利亞之外，其餘白俄，己變成了蘇聯在東北的第五縱隊。　　史丹愷維基將軍　首次透露　蘇軍在東北眞相　　在刦後滿目瘡痍的瀋陽城裏，矗立着一座高大的花崗石紀念碑，上面頂着一輛銅質的蘇聯式坦克車模型，碑上鑄着這樣的字句：「爲打倒日本帝國主義爭取蘇聯勝利而殉難的坦克車隊先烈留下不朽的光榮。」　　這不僅是一塊紀念十位蘇聯抗戰英雄的石碑，同時也是蘇聯出征東北的一個象徵。　　這中國的東北一角曾經是世界最大的穀倉之一，是中國煤和鐵的主要產地，也是亞洲的工業中心。但是今日的東北已經是面目全非了。當日本投降時還是「原封未動」的，可是在蘇聯「當家」了十八個月以後、東北變得一團糟了。除了蘇聯似乎想永久據爲已有的戰略地區旅順大連以外，沒有一處地方是倖免了的。工業化的東北已被剝除了所有的工業設備而變成一片焦土了。　　遣屍浮腫羣犬爭食　　筆者曾目睹蘇軍佔領下的東北情形，時候正當現代最大擄掠案的最後幾天，只見迎續不斷的火車和船隻滿載着糧食，機器和原料向蘇聯方面開去。筆者在紅軍監視下，隨着第一批到達東北的中國接收人員，巡視被刦後的瀋陽的遺迹。　　我們以不速之客到達了瀋陽，但是東北蘇軍司令官史丹愷維基熱烈地歡迎我們，招待我們住在華貴的大和旅館。這裏雖然沒有冷熱水，（因爲蘇聯已把發電機拆去），但食物倒很　美，還有很多的日本啤酒。　　瀋陽已經變成了一個齷齪而危險的城市。在郊外我們看見幾具浮腫發黑的屍體，幾只狗正在爭食着。這幾具屍體已經暴露了幾個月，面目糢糊，已經不能辨諷國籍。據伴同我們巡視的中國人說：在恐怖時期的最初幾天，蘇軍看見異國人民不分友敵，一槪格殺弗論，在他們到達東北三星期以來，已經埋葬了六千具屍體。　　瀋陽各處垃圾堆積如山，掃除工作極爲困難。據史丹愷維基將軍估計，瀋陽全城堆積的垃圾約有四十萬噸之多，有幾條馬路完全被垃圾堵塞住了。當局雖有意淸除這些垃圾，但是缺乏車輛搬運，全城所有公共汽車六百輛，已全部失蹤，兩百輛電車只賸十二輛，而所有私人車輛全被紅軍徵發去了。　　全盛時代的瀋陽工業在整個東北工業中，佔去百分之四十，至於東北工業則約略等於中國的其他部分。瀋陽每年生產鋼鐵四百萬噸，人造石油三百五十萬噸，從附近撫順煤礦中開採煤斤一千五百萬噸，每月製造飛機一百架，設有汽車，織物及橡皮等工廠和亞洲最大的烟草廠。據日本人說：瀋陽的倉庫裏儲有五毅六百萬噸。現在，這一切都不知去向了。　　搬拆工作拚命趕辦　　日本佔領東北十四年中，瀋陽和東北所有的工業地區，都是從平地建設起來的。帝國政府和日本大企業家投下鉅額資金，在古城的周圍，建立了許多工業區。當　　開入時，　陽共有工　五千所，其中九百所用工人二百名以上。現在呢，小工廠已被拆除了三分之二，大工廠百分之九十已經損壞或全部毁減。大工廠當然是日人獨資經營的，小工廠則往往有華人投資的。　　我們曾和許多目睹或帮助紅軍搬走東北工業設備的中國日本及白俄居民談話，知道蘇軍曾拚命趕辦搬運工作，限於一九四五年十一月十五日以前完成。在這天以前，每天平均有二百輛貨車滿載機器和食糧，向蘇聯國境開去。此後暫時靜止了一會。十二月中，有一部分蘇軍撤退，但不久又回來繼續搬運，一直到一九四六年初爲止。　　這一個限期原是規定在中蘇友好條約裏面的，這條約證實了並且代替了雅爾達協定裏面的秘密條款，該條款規定蘇聯對千島羣島及中國東北九省的要求將於日本投降以後滿足之。　　旣成事實公然承認　　在我们第一次进歷东北以後，史丹愷維燕將軍重又招待我們並且坦白地和我們談話。起初，他對於被拆毁或炸毁的工廠，兵工廠或飛機塲，裝做不知道，反而問我們爲什麼不去參觀參觀博物館或教堂。後來，他對我們說：「關於日本軍事工業，這是三強的決議。我們不欲它留在這裏，所以有一部分已經搬走了。」　　史氏又承認東北日軍約五十萬人以上，已經移送到西伯利亞去，這是瀋陽大連和哈爾濱人所共知的事實，但是蘇聯官吏公然承認的，史氏不是第一人。　　蘇聯的計劃並不是完全暫時性的，當掠奪工作將近宛畢時，他們開始對中國政府施用壓力，使它和中共敵對。他們要求在條約內規定的共同管理鐵路和開發旅順以外，又增加了幾條，包括中蘇共管共有鑛山，資源及內地河流，蘇聯人民自由購買或以其他方法獲得財產等項。　　白俄變成第五縱隊　　東北有許多亡命的白俄曾在大戰期間帮助日軍對蘇作戰。當蘇軍佔領東北時，大家以爲這些白俄將被肅淸了，可是事實恰得其反：除了著名反蘇份子謝米諾夫及其心腹同黨百餘人被槍斃或遣送至西伯利亞以外，其餘一律發給特種蘇聯國籍證書，供給中國或日本住所，和鐵路局或蘇聯工廠職員等職業。這些白俄，現在已經變成蘇聯在東北的第五縱隊。他們大多數久居在中國，能說中國話，並且熟悉東方情形。　　強迫簽字市長堅拒　　蘇聯人利用各種方法取得財產。瀋陽市長董文琦初次到任時，蘇聯司令史丹愷　　將軍要求他簽字簽日本大　十五處，（包括大和旅館在內）移交給蘇聯遠東經濟局。萱氏當提出抗義，經過幾小時的爭執以後，他答應於次晨十一時簽覆。第二天，當他離開旅館前往赴約時，一顆子彈在他頭上飛嘯而過。到達蘇軍司令部時，他說他對於此事無權作主，希望蘇聯方面與中國高級當局談判此事。董氏旋即回到大和旅館，卻見們的男間已被人闖入，無綫電話也被剪斷。他終於被迫離工那裏。　　據董氏估計：從瀋陽·長春·鞍山鐵鑛·撫順煤鑛等處竊取的機器，約計五十萬噸。假如獲得美國的充分援助，瀋陽被毀的工廠可在一年以內修復大半，否則就非五年以上的時間不可。　　蘇軍在淮陽自印鈔票，以搜購各種財物。據董氏估計：蘇軍在到達瀋陽最初三個月內發行的軍票，總數達一百萬萬元以上，其價値　當時尙　　的日　相等。結果，瀋陽的幣制弄得紊亂不堪　　白俄難民陳述眞相　　關於蘇聯掠奪東北物資的情形，一位白物難民所口述的最為精采。他是一位工程師，曾經參加鞍山鋼鐵廠的搬拆工作，後來被派到大連去充當繙譯。　　鞍山位於瀋陽大連之間，曾經是美國B-29型空中堡壘的主要轟炸目標之一，但並未受到多大換害。该地的中日居民大部份在礦山和机器中工作。当蘇军初到的時候，這些礦山和工廠全部開工，十足生產，機器廠有鎔鐵廠及展鐵廠（Rolling-mill）九所，機器製造廠一所，發電廠一所，選鑛廠（Ore-dressing　Plant）一所，巨大熱煤廠四所，人造　質（Benzene）製煉廠三所和科學硏究院一所。鋼鐵廠和礦山之間，有電車網布着，還有一所大規模的車輛修理廠。除了瀋陽以外，鞍山要算是東北最　美的果子了。　　鞍山顯然是精密而有計劃地被掠奪了的。據那白俄吿訴我們：在九月二十日那天，由官員和工程師五十人組成的「科　洛夫團」（科薩洛夫是團長的名字）到達了鞍山。他們在各工廠考察了三天以後，突然宜佈要把工廠拆除三分之二，並限於十月廿八日以前搬動出境。因爲拆除的部分超過了預計的三分之二，限期運被展延到十一月四日，而搬移工作直到十一月六日方才完畢。從鞍山搬運機器到大連，所用的列車，共有六十輛之多。這樣，鞍山的全部資源被搬走了百分之八十。　　這位白俄又吿訴我們：蘇軍誠恐中美兩國根據條約規定，堅持大連必須自由通商，因此拼命搬走他們的掠獲物。時間旣侷促，運輸工具又缺乏，蘇軍不得不用坦克車來拖精細的機器，結果百分之二十遭損壞了。（三月號水星雜誌）讀者意見規約　　（一）本欄絕對公開，文自負責。但切忌冗長。（二）切勿攻訐私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆名。（四）本欄稿件槪不致酬。（五）對來稿本報有删節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，概不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。　　一個三房客之呼籲　　編者先生：　　本市房荒嚴重，衆所週知，惟利是圖之業主，嘗藉故驅逐住戶，冀將房屋收回，再行轉租，期獲暴利，而法院受理此種案件，祗在法言法，不顧現實，房客十九被判遷讓，此種事件，當局如不速謀補救，房荒嚴重，更難解決，筆者是身受其苦，今將經過事實，懇借貴刋一角，予以露佈，以求社會之援助，緣敝處之房屋，因二房東與業主發生糾紛，訴訟在案，未經解決，同時業主復遞狀法院，指三房客未得業主許可，佔住房屋有害其產權，並提供現金祖保三百萬，聲請假執行，勒令三房客遷讓，而院方不探求事實，竟准如所請，即限令三房客六個月內遷讓，其理由稱二房東旣已被判遷讓，其與業主之租約即經停止，故三房客亦應遷讓，我等被判不服，上訴高院，但遞狀後至今並無音訊，此去年七月事，上月十七日，突來執行傳票，開庭時，諭令我等於十五天內遝讓，過限便派警執行，但二房東不執行，因其上訴最高法院，未加審判，我等吿以上訴高院，尙未庭訊，今二房東不執行，三房客何能執行，據答今天是執行庭，惟有執行，餘事不談。我們在此寥寥兩語之下，便失去居住保障，眞果執行，便要露宿街頭，與二房東租賃房屋，稱爲佔住，是則如何租賃始能合法，上訴未經庭訊，便處決執行，二房東乃糾紛之直接當事人，涉訟未決，而三房客是次承租人，無辜被累，在訟事未解決前，便要執行，法律高深，眞使小民莫明其妙，目今生活維艱，民生凋敝，可能蘇民困時，此等案件，理當顧全事實，諭令雙方和解，使刁滑之徒，無從發作，則市內房屋糾紛，可能减少，願當局諸公鑒察焉。（長壽路一羣三房客）　　汽車外勤員之聲辯　　編輯先生：筆者是一個公用局公共汽车上的外勤人员，前天上公司去，在訓導科佈告欄裏看到一位乘客丁先生的來信，（大意是指摘（一）售票員態度不良。（二）時常給英法商的電車售票員免費乘車。（三）有時讓英法商的售票代行開關車門。（四）說我們說不定因是染上了壞習慣……茲以貴報讀者的身份，乞予披露，逐項復答丁先生：　　（一）我們外勤人員，（開車售票查票）工作的時間要近九小時，當早班開始時，你丁先生或許還在好夢中，當夜班落班時，你丁先生或許早就入了睡鄕，况且目下交通又萬分擁擠，乘客百分之九十以上不守秩序，如果要向每個乘客解釋守秩序勿吸烟等等，恐怕用行使外勤職務的全部時間來應付也不够，並且还有另星找數，趙站逃票，足夠擾得你眼花，此在事實上不容許對乘客從容周旋。　　（二）乘客吊車門的事，幾乎在每部擁擠的車上，都有這情形，任憑你們外勤人員，喊得喉啞，大多是置之不理，萬一摔跌，責任却全在我們身上，因之必要時，只有催促往里擠，或拉下來，否則；出了岔子，我們可吃不消。　　（三）英法商電車員工，雖與我們機構各別，可是究屬是同行，丁君以此責難，未免苛細。　　（四）說到英法商員工代執行開閉車門，有時因爲過擠的車廂，有時外勤人員在裘邊執行工作，而剛好到站，一時擠不出來，而客人吵着要上要下，這時，偶而請他們代行，（有時請客人也有）至於要說到喧賓奪主，未免過當。　　（五）承丁君的美意，躭心我們別染上壞習氣，似乎過慮，英法商的員工，決不會在我們車上教我們揩油，况且他們也不見得全是壞人呀！（公共汽車外勤員綠鳩）</p>

<p>出版界每星期四出版與梁漱溟先生談　中國民族之前途  傅統先　　　——讀「鄉村建設理論」書後　　（一）　　梁先生的「鄉村建設理論」是民國二十六年寫完的，我陸續在「鄉村建設」雜誌上讀過一遍，每以未能得窺全豹為憾。最近我買到這本書，我覺得這是一部好書，我覺得梁先生是中國的一個有獨創性的思想家，雖然我跟他的見解並不一樣。照我對於梁先生的印象來講，他對於西洋的哲學和社會科學所知道的恐怕並不太多，而且關於這一類的書籍也恐怕是讀得不太多，但是他肯想，而且想得很週密，想得很深刻，因此，他所得到的結論可以說是與西洋學術界的思想家並駕齊驅的，所以這本書從它的系統方面講是結構謹嚴，分析精　；從它的內容方面講，它是全憑自己的思考體會。這在中國學術界是不可多得的。　　當然，梁先生並不喜歡別人稱他是思想家，因為他是要採取行動的。他做學問的抱負完全是儒家正統的風度。孔子講學問的時候：「文王旣歿，文不在茲乎？」孟子說：「余豈好辯哉？余不得已也。」梁先生便是這種態度，馮芝生先生雖然也有「承百代之流，會古今之變……為往聖繼絕學，為萬世開太平」的氣派，但可惜他談的和「古今之變」相離太遠，卻不如梁先生切切實實從理論中尋求中國民族的前途。　　但是當梁先生實施他的理論的時候，他卻遭遇到許多的困難，而且至今我們還沒有看得到一點他的鄉村建設的成效。梁先生現在已　到四川閉門著述去了。這，一部分是因為他沒有得到他的環境的允許，另一部分是因為他的理論本身還有許多沒有解決的困難。本文預備就這兩點加以評述。　　（二）　　至於他的實際工作，何以不能得到環境的允許，我以為這是因為梁先生對於現實的政治沒有看清楚。他說：「我們的鄉村建設主張，固不違反三民主義，卻是自成系統，不同於人。假若當初中國政府也像蘇聯等國家那樣當真地一黨專政，早不容我們存在。然而中國卻不是這樣。這個地方不容，還有那個地方；那個地方不容，還有第三個地方。當初容了下來，由此就有後來的發展。總之，散而且亂的中國社會反映到政治亦是散而且亂。沒有自由的空氣，卻有自由的事實。」我們認為梁先生在這種夾縫裏討生活的辦法是錯誤的，實際上他已經是失敗了。要知社會改造是不能跟政治脫離關係的。梁先生說：「政府為一面，社會為一面，中間總有點隔離，」這是不對的。現在的社會都在政治勢力之下。以眼前局勢而論，現在的中國社會大部分是國民政府的勢力之下，一小部分在共產黨的統治之下。假使你要發動一個大的社會改造運動，那末你不走政治的路，便是走教育的路。假使你走政治的路而要發生大的作用，那末你有三條路：第一條是國民黨的路，第二條是共產黨的路；第三條是同時向前兩個方向革命的路。梁先生似乎不要走這些政治的路而想走教育的路。但假使你決定走教育的路，那末你不在國民政府的勢力之下，便在共產黨勢力之下。於是乎你一方面要實行你的理論（這理論和這兩方面的理論雖不相同，但也並不衝突的），另一方面你就要設法適應你所選定的那一方面。我們覺得梁先生的這種適應環境的能力不夠。結果，現在他只好仍然做理論學術的工作，而且是在國民政府勢力之下做理論學術的工作　　（三）　　以上是就實際情形而論，現在簡單的講一講他的理論體系。他的這部書可以分成三部分：（一）他對於中國社會的認識；（二）他對於如何改造中國社會的辦法的建議；（三）他理想中的新社會。　　關於他對於中國社會的認識又可以分成三點：第一點他說明中國舊社會的組織是基於倫理本位和職業分立兩點而維持這個社會秩序的力量是理性（即教化，禮俗，自力）而不是武力。第二點他說明舊社會在今日崩潰的由來，他以為這個崩潰一方面是由於中國在外交上，軍事上的失敗，和國際經濟競爭上的失敗，另一方面是由於中國人民因受西方文化的影響而對於固有文化的厭棄和反抗。第三點他說明中國舊社會崩潰的結果是一方面把固有的倫理本位和職業分立的社會秩序給破壞無遺，而另一方面又不能建一個有權有力的國家，來負起建設新社會的責任。　　至於他所建議的解決問題的辦法也可分三點來講。第一點，他想從組織農村來建立一個新社會秩序，他想用中國固有的教化，禮俗，自力的理性作用來建立一個有西洋團體功能的社會，這個工作從鄉村做起最好。第二點，他想用社會運動的力量來解決中國的政治問題，他想把知識分子的理性浸潤到廣大農民的潛力中而形成一種堅強的組織而使現存的政治勢力向他曲膝。具體的設計分三步：（一）知識分子回鄉之前其本身必須聯絡組織；（二）即從回鄉知識分子間之廣大聯絡，形成一中心勢力而逐漸在鄉村開展散布；（三）「此廣大聯合而植基鄉村的勢力一形成，則形勢頓即轉移過來，彼破壞鄉村的勢力乃不能不被威脅克服於我。」第三點在經濟方面，他想「散漫的農民，經知識分子領導，逐漸聯合起來為經濟上的自衛自立；同時從農業引發了工業，完全大社會的自給自足，建立社會化的新經濟構造。」　　在他理想中的新社會有六個特點：（一）先農後工，農工結合為均宜的發展；（二）以鄉村為本，都市為末；（三）以人為主體，是人支配物而非物支配人；（四）是倫理本位合作組織而不落於個人本位或社會本位的兩極端；（五）政教經濟三者合一而不相離；（六）以理性維持社會秩序而非武力統治。　　（四）　　關於梁先生的理論方面，因為　　的關係，我們現在只簡單的提出三個比較重大的問題來討論。　　第一，鄉村建設的計劃是否成功，關鍵是在知識分子在一種組織團結之下到鄉下去把鄉下人組織起來。這裏有兩個大困難：（一）知識分子如何可能團結起來？梁先生不是自己也說過：「中國的知識分子都是自由，浪漫，散蕩，個性強，渾身上下浄是反團體的習慣，他那種大爺脾氣，呌他成為一個結實團體，遵守鐵的紀律是不可能的」（九一頁）（二）知識分子又怎樣肯到鄉下去？梁先生並沒有告訴我們一個切實的辦法，使知識分子非到鄉下去不可，至少，保證我們有很大的希望，可以使他們下鄉。梁先生說：「知識分子再不為社會求出路，其自身亦唯有陷於絕境而已。……社會的生路要在鄉村求，知識分子的生路也要在鄉村求。這條路，初去是難，但愈走愈寬。都市裏過剩的知識分子儘你不願回鄉，而形勢所逼恐怕非回來不可。」可是據我們所知有許多知識分子情願流落在都市裏而不願到鄉下去，而鄉下的知識分子又在拼命的往都市裏跑。梁先生雖然可以罵他們是「社會之賊」（三六〇頁）但他們不願去，你罵他們也無用啊！不知梁先生除了種汙緩的Wishlul　thinking之外，有沒有別的辦法。否則梁先生把這樣一個偉大的計劃建築在這樣脆弱的假設上，這是無法實現的。　　第二，梁先生自己說過，他的鄉村運動有四大障碍：（一）地方不安定；（二）運動不便利；（三）苛捐雜稅；（四）天災人禍。他說：「這顯然是個政治問題。這通常說似乎應由國家負責，但在中國建立那樣一個有權力的國家為不可能。非啓發社會力量而統一之，不能奠定國家的統一。那就是要藉鄉村運動來統一中國社會；以全國鄉村運動大聯合的中樞組織為此大社會的總腦筋，間接操持政權」。但我要請問梁先生，假使這個大組織是可能的話，那末你怎樣能夠讓現存的政府或現有的統治機關（你認為他們是不行的，你是想法要逐漸取而代之的）放心讓這個大力量繼續的滋長。它不消滅你，那末你的新社會秩序就會逐漸的淘汰了它的舊社會秩序。不管誰是誰非，我們只問他們會不會「坐以待斃」嗎？否則，他們就會利用他們現有的權力來消滅你。你又有甚麽辦法呢？至於梁先生認為思想潮流可以支配軍閥的武力一點（三六二頁）我以為是書呆子的話。不足置信。我想假使梁先生對於這一點真正有辦法的話，他也不至於跑到四川閉門著書去了。　　第三，梁先生以為假使中國要翻身，一定要憑藉農業。他要想從農業引發工業。關於這一點我們認為也有兩種困難。第一，我們覺得農村的民眾太廣大了，他們的習俗太守舊了，一時我們不容易把他們普遍的組織起來；第二，農業的發展也要靠工業的發展，現代的社會事業在各方面的發展是休戚相關而不能分別先後的。　　（五）　　最後，我們所能同意於梁先生的主張的地方，我們也簡單的講兩句。第一點，梁先生對於中國民族出路的總方向是對的，即以中國的倫理的精神和理性的態度去吸收西洋的團體組織和科學技術，我們的文化出路絕不是全盤西化，因為前次我介紹Sorokin的「今日之危機」一書中已感覺到西洋的功利主義的文化非加以宗教化不可。第二點，他的教育工作的技巧方面完全和現代民主主義的教育方法原理相符，這是可喜的事。至於對梁先生全部學理的批評容後再述。科學新話  東淵　　英·海登教授著　林曦·李亞合譯　科學研究社出版　　海登教授可以說是世界的大科學家，在歷歷可數的幾顆明耀星斗中，他是最新也最燦爛的一顆。他是把最新穎的科學理論和革命實踐結合於一身的巨人！　　這本集子，是他所著的許多科學小品中，摘譯出來的，譯者並提出了兩個原則：一，太專門，太精潔，或太對英國人說話的，不譯。二，儘可能譯那對新興科學的理論有些闡釋的。在這樣的原則之下，譯者摘出這裏的廿多篇優良而淺顯通俗的科學小品。　　這裏的文章，它的第一優點，是不使人頭痛，把科學緊貼着人們的社會生活，閑閑而來，淡淡而入，文筆簡明，誠懇，自然，而且有力。它的的確確能幫助人們多懂許多科學上的必要知識　　這本書裏面一共包括二十五篇科學小品，以及附錄四篇，總計是二十九篇，每一篇都是或多或少地告訴了我們新科學的知識。　　因為它文字的通俗，容易使讀者溶化，更值得廣大的人們共所一讀。　　這書的第一篇，「咱們和宇宙」，明確地說出這之間的數種學說及其正確性。接着所說的：太陽有多麽遠？火山的誕生，驅逐霧氣，都是那麽易讀，而且幫助我們理解。　　物種的起源及農業的起源，說述的明確，簡單，讀後有一個輪廓。如：「農業，並不像人們所曾經顯然相信的那樣，發生在有着複雜的階級社會的大河流域；它卻是在山谷裏過活着的一些小小的公社裏發生的，而且，那些公社很可能是無階級的。」　　其餘，顯微鏡意外；沒法治好的病人，可不可以殺掉？結核病；霉菌戰勝細菌；諸篇對於生理上敘述頗豐。我們需要什麽？談發明，亮光還是黑沉沉，諸篇則對於科學的一般常識，在這裏面所述很詳。　　為什麽他們要害怕科學？作者指出：「為什麽有那麽多人憎恨和害怕科學呢？希特勒的V1和V2武器都是應用科學的偉大成就。很多倫敦居民一定願意把發明它的科學家弔死的。」在此，我們可以瞭然，一般人是為此而要害怕科學。　　緊接上一問題的，是怎樣處理德國的科學，作者提出三種一般人對德國科學敵視的理由，並指出其錯誤之處及處理方法。　　「原子的分裂」一篇，還是海登教授在一九三九年時所寫，而那時他已經預言了人類可能利用原子能。在這篇文字中，他敘述了人類對原子知識的發展。——這對於我們對原子彈的認識，是很有幫助的。　　此外，種族，宗教和罪犯，「如何處理我的屍體」，都告訴了我們不少知識，如猶太人的為什麽少犯謀殺，誤殺，兇毆，偷竊，收買黑貨，盜用，強姦等罪，而偏重於犯欺騙，偽造，詐取，和偽稱破產罪，這裏作者是予以解說。　　先有鷄還是先有蛋？知更鳥為什麽要呌？這是二個很有趣的問題，作者也很有趣地告訴了我們其中的理由。　　附錄的四篇，是：一，怕伏洛夫學說的新的發展；二，美國科學家找到的新物質；三，行星起源的新學說；四，吃米革命。　　這四篇，都就其本題作了很充分的說明。　　在中國科學書籍很貧乏的今天，這本書，的確是值得推　的。我們要有科學的基本常識，這樣的好書是可作為唯一的讀物的。　　我不希望初讀科學書籍的朋友，一開頭就讀壞書，因為這是容易灌輸毒質的。所以，我先將這好書介紹給諸位！出版界消息　兒童知識　極博好評　　本市兒童書局，以供給優良兒童讀物為職志。出版物頗博好評，徐蔚南先生說：「兒童知識」書報，編制得非常生動，印刷·圖畫·文字·都非常精美。馬崇淦先生說：「兒童書局新出兩種定期刊物：（一）「兒童故事」月刊，（二）「兒童知識」書報，都能做到「新」·「精」·「趣」三點，可說是小學生最優良的讀物。」　　北平上智編譯館印行方豪教授編馬相伯先生文集內收論文一百十三篇，函購九十三件，家書六十六通。書首並冠以編者所撰先生事略，百歲行蹟，都三十萬言。精印一鉅冊，業已出版。售價：二十開上等白報紙本每部二萬元，十六開道林紙精印本每部五萬元，外埠酌加郵寄費。是書由門生于右任題字，輔仁大學校長陳垣作序，並附有銅板紙精印馬先生照

一國分配六十餘艘，海軍總部於接獲通知後，已準備派員赴日接收，這在建立新海軍，充實國防的工作上，又可得到不少幫助。使人慚愧的是海軍總部目前所有的官兵，竟不敷此六十餘艦之用。我們得趕快訓練新海軍呵！　　「救濟物資」，「賠償物資」，得到的不能算少了，然而中國卻還是這樣的窮。這些賠償物資，希望能支配得當，善為其用，使國家賴以復興，人民蒙受裨益，尤其要注意拔術人員的培養和訓練，因為有了這許多物資，如果沒有適當的人材去加以積極運用，還是等於沒有啊。起而應戰  季水　　我想麥帥不致於會把日本的足球隊·棒球隊，差遣來華「遠征」的。如果言而有中，問題自然沒有了；如果言而不中，他們竟堂而皇之的來了，那怎麽辦呢？我的意思是必須起而應戰，而且必須把來華「遠征」的球隊，打得落荒而走而後已。如果拒人於千里之外，或人家已經來扣關罵戰了，我們卻洩氣的把免戰牌高高懸起，那還成什麽話呢？總之，問題的關鍵，完全在我們的「球隊」的兩肩上，來不來是不必顧慮的。「一考十磅」  蔣菊舲　　學生間往往有「一考十磅」的老話，那就是說經過考試一次，就是減少十磅體重，其有碍於學生的健康可想而知。所以我反對繁重的學校考試制度。一般學校往往把考試看得很重要，於是學生不得不被迫着為了考試而讀書，這個弊端一定不小。我想學校如果把月考大考的緊張空氣，平均分佈在平時各科的練習上面，分數準確性一定要比在考塲裏產生的大得多。空禍  錢蕃甫　　解事的時候開始，我已經幻想和尋覓着死的最好方法：應該不是自殺，不妨悲壯轟烈，無纏綿病榻的疾苦，要死於不知不覺間；作為人生的最後歸宿。　　因此，我感覺你們的離開人間，是毫無缺陷的死——不帶恐怖無須考慮，也來不及率掛，把生命視同塵土，將軀壳化為灰燼，不留痕跡，何等亁凈！　　對於你們的少數旅伴——那些幸而逃脫行商，身負傷創的人，雖然有人向他們慶賀，我卻替他們抱歉；事實上，他們除了「不幸」以外，沒有得到什麽，他們錯過了一次最舒適，平靜的死底機會。　迅速接話器  天平　　普通，你要打電話給某人，必須知道此人之電話好碼，然後撥動數盤。如果一個商人或是極忙的人，他要連打很多的電話，就覺麻煩。最近發明了一迅速接僴器，佔位極小，置於電話機旁，器內預先定了時需通訊者之號碼，由薄片指示通訊者之姓名，需要時將鐵片移動，使某人之名顯露，插頭插入器之下部，通電後，接綫器毫無錯誤地，自動接綫，再用不着以手指撥動，多費時間。藝文壇  永　　東北作家陳陵，曾於戰時創刊純文藝月刊「自由中國」，勝利後停刊。茲孫陵已來滬，近正集資數千萬元，籌備復刊事宜。聞創刊號稿件已在徴集中。　　新豐出版社主持人豐村，最近亦正籌劃出版一純文藝刊物，名稱定為「小說雜誌」。　　戰前商務印書館曾出版「文學雜誌」一種，由朱光潛主編。最近該刊即將復刊，仍由朱光潛主編，創刊號稿件正發排中。　　中華全國文藝協會主辦之「中國作家」月刊，由葉紹鈞主編，五月份內可出版。　　另有純文藝刊物兩種聞亦正籌劃出版中：其一為「脈搏」，其另一為「文藝靑年」。　　范泉主編永祥印書館印行之「文藝春秋」月刊四卷四期，已於本月十五日出版，內有施蟄存耿濟之等相片多幀，手　多幅，文字極見精彩。　　木刻家劉峴，居北平，除製作「故都街景」木刻數十幅外，尚有連環木刻「災難」，係描寫黃河水災景象，將編成專集出版。瓊樓風月主角（琴述羅吉絲與華德畢金之戀愛表情）危城記  秦瘦鷗　　蘭的堂兄是個忠厚木訥的老公務員，給老祝這麽一說，臉不由立刻紅了半爿。　　「這時候還發牢騷，祝先生。」老祝的話早給坐在前面第一輛洋車上的蘭全聽到了，便回頭來用着又像嘉許，又像怪怨的語氣說。　　祝兆年的回答是哈哈大笑。　　從桂林南站到二塘也有六七公里長的一段路，平日是很少人走的，然而今晚，為了逃難——最好聽的名詞是「疏散」，沿途便展開了人和車的劇烈的競走；每個人都懷着極大的希望，想在捷足先登的原則下，解決幾天來，甚至幾星期來奔走呼號，未獲如願的離開桂林——這一座危城——的問題。目光朗然地照映着這些悄緒慌張的亂離的憔悴的臉龐，像憐憫似的輕撫着他們的全身，但人卻沒有心情再注意這慈愛而美麗的月兒了。　　將近二塘時，人聲愈來愈嘈雜了；鐵路兩旁的田野裏到處是人的影子在竄動。　　老祝握着滿卷熱汗，像一個頒發衝鋒令的軍官似的指揮着老黃，阿李，以及蘭的堂兄，一面把從洋車上卸下的行李搬到最貼近路軌的所在去，一面夾護着蘭跟徘徘榮兒，打人堆裏擠換過去。　　黑黝黝像一條死去的鰐魚似的火車已在路軌上停下了，無數的人分四面包圍着它，有的正從車窗裏鑽進去，有的已經上了車頂，有的　着車頭；這情景使人立刻連想到一條丟棄在地上，而被無數螞蟻圍擁着的魚骨。（四六）</p>

<h3>Promulgation of Administrative Guidelines, National Government to Reorganize Tomorrow, All Parties Agree to Zhang Qun's Appointment as Head of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] The new government's administrative guidelines were formally announced at 8:30 PM on the 16th at the National Government Chairman's residence, in a grand gathering of members from the three parties and social elites. The candidate for the new Executive Yuan President was also decided, with Zhang Qun to assume the post. The new administrative guidelines were signed by the leaders of the three parties and handed to Wu Dingchang for safekeeping at the National Government, with a scheduled announcement on the 18th. The Chairman, dressed in a traditional Chinese gown and jacket, appeared dignified that evening. All attendees maintained an extremely solemn attitude. The Chairman began with a brief speech stating, "The government reorganization has finally come to fruition, and I am deeply gratified. Hereafter, we should cooperate with each other to lay the foundation of democracy." The signing then commenced, with the Chairman leading, followed by Zhang Junmai, then Zeng Qi, followed by Mo Dehui, and finally Wang Yunwu. After the signing, the Chairman further expressed hope that the National Government Committee could be formed immediately. Zhang Junmai and Zeng Qi each submitted a letter containing their respective party's list of government committee members. The Democratic Socialist Party's list included Wu Xianzi, Ji Yiqiao, and Hu Haimen (the originally planned Xu Fulin was still under full negotiation within the Democratic Socialist Party). The Youth Party's list included Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, and He Luzhi. The list of social elites was scheduled to be decided on the 17th. Subsequently, the Chairman inquired about the opinions of the two parties. Zhang and Zeng both expressed their delight at the Kuomintang's determination to end political tutelage. The discussion then turned to the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. Based on the provisions of Article 6 of the administrative guidelines, the candidate for the Executive Yuan President during the transitional period should be agreed upon by all parties. The Chairman announced on the spot whether they agreed to Zhang Qun's appointment as Executive Yuan President. Members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties immediately applauded, unanimously approving the proposal. Zhang Qun rose to express his intention to consult further with all parties. The meeting adjourned around 10:00 PM. This grand ceremony was thus completed, and the foundation of democracy was laid.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] Chairman Chiang hosted a dinner at his residence at 7:00 PM on the 16th for government officials participating in the government reorganization, including Yu Youren, Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Wang Shijie. They discussed the Kuomintang's list of government committee members and other issues related to the government reorganization. After dinner, Yu Youren and Chen Lifu departed first. Members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties arrived, and the signing ceremony commenced.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The National Government is scheduled to reorganize on the 18th. The post-reorganization administrative guidelines were formally signed on the evening of the 16th by the leaders of the Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, and Youth Party, as well as representatives of social elites. These administrative guidelines and the list of National Government Committee members are scheduled to be announced simultaneously on the 18th. The Kuomintang's list of participants in the government committee is likely to be discussed and decided at a special meeting of the Central Executive Committee on the 17th. The signing of the administrative guidelines by the leaders of the three parties and representatives of social elites took place at 9:40 PM on the evening of the 16th at Chairman Chiang's residence. Earlier, at 8:00 PM, Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet for government representatives Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Guofu, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Bai Chongxi, Chen Bulei, Chen Cheng, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Dingchang, Li Wenfan, Zhang Qun, Wang Chonghui, Lei Zhen, and others to discuss the issue of government reorganization. Later, the Chairman invited Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, Mo Dehui, Wang Yunwu, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Jiang Yuntian, and Yu Jiaju for discussions. All government political consultative representatives, except for Chen Lifu, were present. The Chairman expressed his satisfaction with the cooperation of the three parties in laying the foundation for democratic politics and then exchanged views on the administrative guidelines of the reorganized National Government. According to reports, only Article 12 (slightly modified) of the guidelines was amended in today's Kuomintang Central Executive Committee meeting. The original wording of the preceding section of that article was, "The councils or provisional councils of each province, city, and county should, as far as possible, allow the joint participation of various parties and non-party individuals." The phrase "as far as possible" in the text was changed to "by." When Chairman Chiang presented these guidelines, all parties had no objections. Chairman Chiang signed first, followed by Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, Mo Dehui, and Wang Yunwu. Zhang, Zeng, and others then successively delivered speeches, elaborating on the significant implications of this government reorganization. Regarding the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, it is understood that it will be implemented immediately after the National Government's reorganization. The selection of individuals from various parties and social elites to participate in the Executive Yuan is still under continued negotiation. During tonight's meeting, Chairman Chiang proposed Zhang Qun to succeed as President of the Executive Yuan, which was applauded and approved by representatives from all parties. The candidate for Vice President has not yet been announced, but it is rumored that Wang Yunwu is a strong contender. It is also learned that the selection of social elites to participate in the National Government Committee has not yet been finalized. Democratic Socialist Party leader Zhang Junmai returned to Shanghai by car on the evening of the 16th. It is said that Zhang will return to Nanjing in the short term.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Regarding the methods for the Premier's commemorative weeks, the display of the Party and National Flags, the reading of the Premier's will at meetings, and other procedures after the government reorganization, the Central Executive Committee has decided to revise them. This case was previously brought up for discussion at the 62nd meeting of the Central Executive Committee and was studied in detail. It was generally agreed that the various procedures mentioned above were originally intended to commemorate the Premier's noble and great personality and to ensure that the people of the whole country understood the reasons for these regulations. Now that the Three Principles of the People have been widely embraced by the people, and the core beliefs have been established, it is appropriate to take advantage of the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional rule to revise these procedures. The Standing Committee decided today as follows: (1) Commemorative weeks for the Premier will be discontinued in governments at all levels, people's representative bodies, people's organizations, and schools at all levels. Alternative commemoration methods will be determined after the government reorganization. Party branches at all levels will continue to hold them as before. (2) Displaying the Party and National Flags. In the future, Party branches will continue to display them as before. Government agencies, organizations, and schools will only display the National Flag and the Founding Father's portrait. (3) Reading the Founding Father's will at meetings. In the future, this will be waived for government agencies, organizations, and schools. Party branches will continue to do so as before. (4) The National Anthem will remain the same for the time being until the government promulgates a new National Anthem (the current National Anthem has historical significance and is not easily modified, and many countries use revolutionary songs as their national anthems, including those of the martyrs).</p>

<h3>Yang Lianggong States that Taiwan's Clearing Work Can Be Completed by the End of the Month, Cultural Exchange is More Important Than Economy</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 16th] Fujian-Taiwan Supervisory Envoy Yang Lianggong met with our reporter on the 16th. The order in Taiwan has gradually been restored, and the clearing work is expected to be fully completed by the end of this month. When he and Supervisory Committee member He Hanwen were in Taiwan, they suggested to the authorities that this work be terminated as soon as possible, as all parties hope that Taiwan will see peace again soon. When asked by the reporter about his views on the Taiwan aftercare issue, Yang believes that the main point is mutual trust. After the reform, except for heavy industry, which should be handled by the central and provincial governments, light industry should be developed by the Taiwanese. More important than the economy is cultural exchange. They plan to suggest to the education authorities that the Taiwanese elementary and secondary schools should increase the number of National Language (Mandarin) courses, and special attention should also be paid to the history, geography, and civics of the motherland. In addition, the exchange of students is also urgent. Yang met with Taiwanese representatives in Nanjing, including Yang Zhaojia, on the 16th and will visit Chairman Chiang and Minister Bai Chongxi in the next few days to report on his findings.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] At the Central Propaganda Department's press conference on the 16th, Minister Peng answered questions from reporters. The questions and answers are recorded below:</p>
<p>Question: If a foreign aircraft flies over Chinese airspace without prior permission, what action will Chinese air defense forces take?

Is shooting permissible only against certain types of military aircraft, such as fighters, destroyers, or bombers?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Any foreign aircraft that enters our airspace without permission will be considered an infringement of our airspace sovereignty. Our side will first force it to land at our airfield. If it does not comply, it will be shot down in the air. (2) Whether an aircraft entering our airspace is military or civilian (because photographic and bombing equipment is not easily visible from the outside), it is difficult to identify in the air. Therefore, everything will be handled according to item (1).</p>
<p>Question: What is the current military situation?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) In northern Shaanxi, the remaining main force of He Long, about 30,000 people, is gathered near Long'an, north of Anse. The national army is attacking from the south from Yulin and from the north from Waibao. The forces will soon converge.

<p>Question: One of the common policy guidelines agreed upon by the Kuomintang and other parties states: "As long as the Chinese Communists are willing to make peace and national railway transportation is restored, the CCP issue will be resolved politically."

Does the government agree with this interpretation?</p>
<p>Answer: Please read the original text of Article 4 of the National Government's policy guidelines for clarification. "The CCP issue will still be resolved politically as a basic principle. As long as the Chinese Communists are willing to make peace and railway transportation is fully restored, the government will seek domestic peaceful unification through political means."

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Letter to Marshall; Stating Attitude on Korean Issue; US, UK, and Soviet Union Should Engage in Comprehensive Consultations Immediately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's letter to General Marshall regarding the Korean issue is recorded below: "General Marshall: I acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 8 to Mr. Molotov regarding the situation in Korea, which I have read with gratitude. I wish to state the attitude of our government on the Korean issue. The future of Korea is of vital interest to China and is a matter of great concern to China. The Chinese people and their government have always believed that the Korean people should be granted independence as quickly as possible. It has been a long time since Japan surrendered, but a government of the Korean people has not yet been established in Korea, which we deeply regret. We believe that the establishment of the Korean government and the commencement of its work should not be delayed any longer. In order to enable the Koreans to realize their desire for freedom and independence as soon as possible, the Chinese government believes that if the countries occupying the country cannot reach an agreement as soon as possible, the four countries, the United States, Britain, and China, that participated in the Moscow Agreement of December of the previous year (regarding the Korean issue) should immediately engage in comprehensive consultations. I have also instructed the Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union to send a copy of this letter to Mr. Molotov and Mr. Bevin."</p>

<h3>Dutch Financial Authorities Reject Overseas Chinese Request to Increase Remittances to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 15th] Authoritative sources say: Dutch financial authorities have rejected a request submitted by overseas Chinese through Consul General Chiang to increase remittances (those remitted back to domestic municipalities). The Dutch refusal is due to "the difficult economic situation here." As such, the Foreign Exchange Administration continues to approve remittances of 1 million guilders per month or 3 million guilders per quarter. According to statistics, nearly 78,000 overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies applied for remittances in the first quarter. This also means that the remittance for each applicant is less than 40 guilders.</p>
<h3>Remittances from Overseas Chinese in Singapore Suddenly Increased in March; Believed to be the Result of Austerity Measures</h3>

<h3>US Foreign Food Relief Fund; 50 Million Allocated to Our Country; Methods are Being Considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press] Official sources say: Truman requested that Congress, after the end of UNRRA, continue to allocate 50 million US dollars to China from the 350 million US dollars emergency relief fund for countries suffering from war and natural disasters. This plan, together with Truman's 400 million US dollar aid plan for Greece and Turkey, is being considered separately by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. According to Secretary of State Acheson, the plan is for food relief to Australia, Greece, Italy, and China "which may also be included" after the end of UNRRA, and other officials have confirmed that China is included. It is also said that the provisional allocation to China is 50 million US dollars. The State Department refused to announce the allocation of the 350 million US dollars, even to members of Congress, believing that if any country receiving relief knew its total amount, that country would immediately regard it as a debt, and if the future result were not the case, there would be a difficult feeling.</p>

<p>All members of the 7th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Police Academic Research Association: The association has been established for seven years. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all comrades, the club affairs have made progress day by day. As for studying and formulating police building plans, assisting military officers in changing careers, introducing European and American police academics, and studying and improving the domestic police system, it has also contributed to our country's police building cause, which is gratifying. At this annual meeting, members in Beijing and representatives from various branch offices are gathered together to review the past and encourage the future. How to strengthen ourselves unremittingly, be new and fresh every day, encourage the sincerity of cultivating morality and learning, and fulfill the responsibility of loyalty to the party and love for the country. It is hoped that all comrades will work together to learn from each other and make further progress. There are still two important matters to tell all comrades: (1) Members of our country's constitution who have the staff to implement should study the implementation methods in detail and assist the government in effectively implementing them. (2) At present, the Communist Party is advocating chaos, endangering the country and harming the people, destroying transportation, and threatening people's lives. Members of the club should urge the police throughout the country to effectively maintain social order, ensure public security, assist the government in comforting the displaced people, and stabilize commodity prices, in order to relieve the suffering of the people. Each should study in detail, practice personally, in order to achieve the current mission, with high hopes.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Strengthening Economic Administration</h3>
<p>Undoubtedly, our country's economy is still in a state of emergency. The Economic Emergency Measures Program passed on February 16th is a clear example of this. Furthermore, the antagonism between various agencies, whether at the central or local level, is quite evident. They compete for power and shirk responsibility. This habit is inherently a difficult-to-cure cancer in politics. Moreover, the endless back-and-forth of official documents is a consistent practice of bureaucrats. Therefore, unifying and streamlining economic administrative power is truly necessary for our country's economy at this stage.</p>
<p>Don't we see many extremely common cases? A matter is transferred from Agency A to Agency B, and then from Agency B to Agency C. After such repeated twists and turns, with each party passing the buck, and sometimes requiring meetings, reviews, investigations, and requests for instructions, it often takes several weeks to obtain an empty, perfunctory reply. By the time actual action is to be taken, all relevant agencies must go through a similar set of procedures again. As time goes on, all timeliness is often lost. The general public feels very troubled by this situation. The government also feels this way, so it constantly calls for simplifying procedures and improving efficiency.</p>
<p>The central government has already established the National Economic Commission as the highest guidance body for all economic administration and as a comprehensive agency. According to this organization, close connections and cooperation could be achieved by each economic administrative department. If another similar agency were added on top of it, it would only create more obstacles to unification and simplification. Wouldn't this contradict the original intention? However, despite this, in order to realize the unification and simplification and directly improve the administrative efficiency of the economy and indirectly promote the production industry, we cannot help but hope that each economic administrative agency will find ways to improve and maximize its functions.</p>
<p>How can the above objectives be achieved? We believe that: First, the layers of management organizations should be reduced. For example, the recent proposal to eliminate the functional departments of various financial institutions, allowing them to develop separately while abolishing the Joint Treasury or turning it into an advisory body, is a practical example. Second, management agencies that do not live up to their names should be abolished. For example, the Fuel Management Committee does not actually control resources or adequately supply civilian use, but it restricts coal merchants and prohibits them from freely extracting and transporting coal, which seems quite unreasonable. Third, all duplicate agencies should be merged. This can be easily found in both central and local governments. If they can be merged based on their nature, not only can the power of affairs be unified, fundamentally reducing the malpractice of procrastination and shirking responsibility, but also expenses can be saved, reducing the financial burden. Fourth, the various relevant committees should be reduced. Committees have many advantages, but they also have many weaknesses, such as delays, procrastination, and irresponsibility. Their drawbacks are especially evident in implementation. Fifth, laws and regulations should be reorganized, and contradictory or repetitive provisions should be eliminated. Currently, various economic laws and regulations: (1) Some were promulgated before or during the war, and their current circumstances are obviously not very suitable, such as the fines or handling fees, which are too small. (2) Some have been repealed or shelved, but are repeatedly invoked, such as the compulsory membership order for industrial and commercial groups and the laws and regulations promulgated under the Economic Emergency Measures Program. (3) Some have not been formulated or have been formulated but have not been implemented, such as the Housing Rental Ordinance and the Minimum Wage Law. Social economy evolves with the times, and if all relevant laws and regulations cannot adapt to the environment and fit the facts, difficulties will inevitably arise during implementation, and the result will affect the implementation of policies.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, laws cannot enforce themselves. If any laws or systems are not earnestly implemented, then even if there are good laws and good intentions, they will be nothing more than waste paper. Therefore, the most important point is that each department can earnestly perform its duties and truly promote things. As long as someone handles things seriously and takes responsibility, the laws can gradually be repaired even if they are not complete, and the malpractice of procrastination and perfunctoriness will not occur everywhere. The key to the effectiveness of administrative unification and simplification mentioned above is nothing more than this. Not only is this true for economic administration, but it is also true for all other administration.</p>
<p>We particularly emphasize strengthening economic administration for two reasons: first, due to the severity of the current economic situation, and second, due to the increasing urgency of this need. This can also be explained from two aspects. One is the need of the government itself, such as various controls, restrictions, allocation, rationing, state-owned enterprises, etc., which require the cooperation and connection of all parties to smoothly complete their missions. The other is the need of the industrial and commercial sectors. As far as labor is concerned, even the dismissal or payment of wages for one or two individuals requires the support and handling of local authorities. If it is not accepted, a small spark may turn into a storm. As for merchants engaged in production, they need even more government assistance. Such as financial turnover, foreign exchange supply, raw material acquisition, power maintenance, and even how to sell products, how to circulate transportation, how to deal with foreign dumping, and even how to transport and sell by-products, and how to purchase production machinery all require government assistance or mediation. It seems that today's government has become the general management office of the industrial and commercial circles, which is not a coincidence. Because as agricultural economy gradually enters into industrial production, the relationship between officials and merchants will naturally become increasingly complex. Especially in this extraordinary period, industry and commerce have entered a semi-controlled state. According to the laws and regulations on price evaluation, wage evaluation, suppression of hoarding, agricultural, industrial, commercial and mining management, and even countless registrations, almost every important action must go through reporting and approval procedures. Therefore, if the organization and personnel of economic administration cannot be strengthened to adapt to this urgent need, the suffering of merchants and the people will not be alleviated, and the country's economic policy will inevitably become a dead letter, unable to be implemented effectively, which is obvious.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Northern Jiangsu (4) The People Eagerly Await a "Just Official"</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>Speaking of local administration, it is also a headache. Being a county magistrate these days is easy to get scolded and difficult to please. However, the common people still eagerly await a "just official" to come.</p>
<p>When it comes to county magistrates, the first thing they say is that everything is in ruins and there is insufficient funding, making it difficult for even the most skilled woman to cook without rice. But the common people say that taxes are too heavy and the budget is too large, making it truly unbearable. To a third party, it is indeed a case of each side having its own reasons and difficulties. But the bottom line is that in the current situation of seven parts military and three parts politics, it is difficult to be a county magistrate and even more difficult for the common people.</p>
<p>We have long said that the biggest problem in the counties of Northern Jiangsu is the unsoundness of grassroots work. Often, a good plan from above is already greatly diminished by the time it reaches the bottom, completely losing its original form.</p>
<p>Here is an example: The Provincial Government wanted to cooperate with the militarization of Northern Jiangsu and issued an order to encourage people to purchase guns. This motive was originally a good plan, but when it came to the local level, the people had to pay money and risk their lives without being able to speak out about it. For example, the Gao County Government once sold 300 guns for 350,000 yuan on orders, but the black market price was selling for 800,000 to 1 million yuan, and the value of a light machine gun was as high as 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Good township chiefs often run away because they are unwilling to violate their conscience too much and cannot get things done. Therefore, the local areas often lack leadership, allowing some local thugs and ruffians to take the opportunity to rise up and exploit the villagers. Even worse, the communists use these ignorant people to set up an intelligence network, which is a major blow to the military.</p>
<p>Local evil forces are a major obstacle to handling local administration. Here, Hai'men County can be taken as the "chief representative." Although this third-class county is smaller in area and population than other counties, the small citizens of this "small city" are divided into the "East Faction" and the "West Faction," each with its own background and spokesperson. Scolding and fighting openly and secretly at all times.</p>
<p>It is said that in the past, Hai'men County accounted for the largest number of lawsuits in Jiangsu Province. At the same time, none of the past Hai'men County magistrates left office without being flattened.</p>
<p>It is said that interim council meetings have been established in all counties in the province, but Hai'men County has not yet organized one. It is expected that there will be another major dispute between the "East Faction" and the "West Faction" in the future.</p>
<p>The Hai'men County magistrate once said to reporters with great emotion: "Although I have only been in office for a few months, most of my time has been spent resolving disputes for the local people." From his words, we can easily understand the complexity of the situation in Hai'men.</p>
<p>This time, the reporter group ran through four counties. Except for the Nantong County magistrate, who is from Dongtai, Northern Jiangsu, the county magistrates of the other three counties, Hai'men, Rugao, and Dongtai, are all from Hunan. From the general tone of the people, everyone still inevitably has some local concepts. At the same time, these county magistrates have all worked in the army in the past, which should be more suitable for cooperating with the military.</p>
<p>Among them, the Rugao County magistrate, Jian, and Commander Li are fellow townsmen from Changsha. In the past, he was the director of the confidential room of the Pacification Commander's Office and also an "editor" in the news industry. He is eloquent, shrewd, and capable. He talked to reporters at length about his land policy, endlessly. He is particularly interested in the Soviet collective farm system. According to him, he had seriously studied it in books for a considerable period before becoming a county magistrate. Before we left Rugao, he specially printed a "Rugao County Yongan Cooperative Farm Reclamation Plan," which contained charts and explanations, making it clear at a glance. If this matter is truly successful, it will of course be a very good work. However, what is worrying is that in the current situation, it seems impossible to be as easy as in the ideal.</p>
<p>This time, we ran a big circle among the counties. In addition to what we heard and saw, we also received many reports and printed materials from the responsible authorities, which piled up into a thick package. Of course, all the plans are good, but whether they will be effective is another matter.</p>
<p>Finally, quoting Commander Li's words: "Everything depends on the cadres."</p>
<p>"Having only military affairs without politics only makes the people suffer more."</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers Conference Approaches Final Stage, Marshall Meets Stalin, Speculation Abounds Regarding the Contents of the Talks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] US Secretary of State, Marshal Marshall, visited Marshal Stalin at 10 pm today and had a conversation with him. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, US State Department Assistant, Bohlen, and Soviet Foreign Minister, Inlottov, were also present.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th United Press] US Secretary of State Marshall, after accusing the Soviet Union of being responsible for the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference to reach a basic agreement, has submitted the US-Soviet dispute over the Four-Power Pact to Prime Minister Stalin. Marshall arrived at the Kremlin at 10 pm. He instructed his staff not to announce the details of his talks with Stalin to the press. The only thing the press liaison secretary of the US delegation, Dermo, could announce was that Marshall arrived at the Kremlin at 10 pm and returned to the embassy at 11:45 pm. Other details of the meeting are unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Moscow, 16th Broadcast: The results of Marshall's meeting with Stalin are being kept strictly secret by both parties. Diplomats here are pessimistic, believing that this meeting proves that the Foreign Ministers Conference has reached a dead end. If the Marshall-Stalin meeting yields no results, the Foreign Ministers Conference will end immediately. What follows will be even greater opposition and animosity among the powers in Europe. Another report: Willis, the director of the Soviet branch of the US Information Service, was forced to resign due to suspicion of being pro-Soviet. It is said that the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and his subordinates are extremely anti-Soviet, making it impossible for the two countries to get closer. US Ambassador Smith has denied this.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: It is reported that Marshall's meeting with Stalin lasted ninety minutes last night and did not break the deadlock caused by various issues at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. From Marshall's standpoint, the main value of this conversation lies in the fact that Marshall frankly and directly stated the US policy toward Germany to the Soviet head of state.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th Dispatch] The "Daily Telegraph" recently published a telegram from a Moscow correspondent, hinting that US Secretary of State Marshall may have requested an audience with Stalin to express his regret over the lack of achievement at the Moscow Conference and to take the opportunity to bid farewell.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th Dispatch] State Department officials declined to comment on Marshal Stalin's meeting with Secretary of State Marshall tonight, pending detailed reports from Moscow. However, US diplomatic circles believe that the two not only discussed the German issue, but also the entire issue of US-Soviet relations. Semi-officials said: If Marshall had requested to meet with Marshal Stalin, he would certainly have thought the timing was appropriate. The general impression is that although Marshall spoke slowly, one hour and forty-five minutes was enough for him to express the US government's views to Marshal Stalin, namely that the attitude of the Soviet delegation was hindering the progress of the Moscow Conference, and to explain the characteristics, limits, and actual results of the Truman Doctrine. Washington officials emphasized that Marshall is a believer in "direct diplomacy." On the Soviet side, in the absence of Ambassador Novikov, they also refused to comment. However, people close to the Soviet Embassy fear that the differences between the US and the Soviet Union are too great, and the Stalin-Marshall meeting may not produce the hope of immediate improvement in relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Regarding Marshal Marshall's visit to Marshal Stalin, political observers here commented that Marshal's request for an audience with Stalin shows that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference has reached its most critical period. The conversation between these two politicians can determine the duration and success or failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has proposed a counter-proposal to the US Four-Power Pact draft, which is sufficient to cause the US draft to fail. In fact, Marshall had already foreseen this difficulty, because what he requested was only that the four powers give a reply in principle to the US proposal.</p>
<h3>Molotov Proposes Amendments, Four-Power Pact Runs Aground, US-Soviet Disagreements Obvious</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Marshall said today: Molotov's amendments to my proposed Four-Power Treaty for the Prevention of German Aggression are sufficient to completely change the scope and purpose of the treaty. Molotov suggested amending the treaty to allow it to involve other matters, such as the permanent elimination of Nazi regimes, the elimination of trusts, and the completion of the collection of reparations. These matters should be handled by the Allied Control Council or the peace treaty. To stipulate them in the Four-Power Treaty will change the scope and purpose of the treaty.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held a meeting today, with US Secretary of State Marshal Marshall making a final effort to get the Foreign Ministers Conference to immediately begin discussing the Four-Power Pact, but it was met with strong opposition from the Soviet Union. As a result, the US proposal has been shelved indefinitely. It is already obvious that the four powers cannot agree. Regarding the coal issue, Marshal Marshall stated that effective control of coal production and distribution by the Allied Control Council will not be possible until the economic unification of Germany has been achieved. French Foreign Minister Bidault also issued a statement, commenting on the attitude of the British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers towards France's proposal on the Ruhr region.</p>
<h3>British Official Goes to Soviet Union to Discuss Trade Issues</h3>

<h3>US-Soviet Lend-Lease Accounts to Be Negotiated Soon, Soviet Union Should Pay More Than Other Countries</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] Official responsible officials said today: The settlement of the US-Soviet Union's lend-lease accounts of more than 11.4 billion US dollars, which has been delayed for a long time, will be negotiated one day. The Soviet side should pay more than other allies. The reason is not due to the dispute between the US and the Soviet Union on current world issues, nor is it due to the Kremlin's refusal to discuss the settlement over the years, because the Soviet Union has obtained more civilian goods than other allies. On the side of other allies, the United States has already agreed to repay the 50 billion US dollars of supplies used to defeat the Nazis during the war at a rate of less than 30 cents per dollar. But it is expected that the Soviet Union will pay at a higher rate. As for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's amendment to the US proposal, it cannot be accepted.</p>

<h3>Truman's Message to Congress Requests Amendment to Neutrality Act, Prohibiting Arms Shipments to Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] After proposing his suggestion to "check the communist plague," President Truman then sent a special message to Congress, requesting authorization to prohibit the shipment of US military equipment and war materials to countries with aggressive intentions, and requesting that the 1939 Neutrality Act be amended, stating: US arms must no longer fall into the hands of potential enemies. If war is imminent and our country is still in its current state, bound by its own laws, it will be an intolerable situation to provide assistance to countries that may launch an attack. I am now making this proposal to prevent the arms trade from being unrestricted, so as to avoid the Pearl Harbor incident that occurred due to aid to Japan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] Authoritative sources stated today on President Truman's proposal to amend the Neutrality Act to prohibit arms shipments to aggressor nations that Truman's new proposal indicates that the United States may not necessarily take a completely impartial path when war breaks out in other countries, but will cut off US aid to any aggressor nation. Truman did not specify the countries that would be hit by the arms embargo, but the meaning seems to refer specifically to the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states, whose policies were condemned by Acting Secretary of State Acheson as "aggressive and expansionist."</p>

<h3>Rice Shop Manager Arrested for Hoarding Over Two Thousand Rice Sacks; Exploiting Market Shortage to Speculate and Repeatedly Raise Prices; Ling Defu Will Be Sent to Court for Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Garrison Headquarters has dispatched large numbers of police officers in recent days to assist the municipal government in monitoring the market and suppressing prices. Yesterday, the headquarters received a tip-off that Yuanmao Rice Shop at No. 6, Lane 344, Fengyang Road, was raising prices and hoarding over two thousand sacks of rice. The Administrative Division's Fourth Section of the Police Bureau sent officers to investigate, arrested the shop's manager, Ling Defu, and took him to the police station for questioning. Ling vehemently denied hoarding and raising prices. The case has now been transferred to the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau for further investigation. On the 9th of this month, rice prices in the city market skyrocketed. On that day, Ling Defu had over ten boats of Lihli rice, totaling over two thousand sacks. Seeing that the market supply was scarce that day, Ling raised the selling price to 137,000 yuan per sack and was unwilling to sell in large quantities. The next day, Ling intended to continue raising prices, but after persuasion from Xu Songren, the market management director, he reluctantly agreed to maintain the original price from the 9th. Economic inspection authorities were extremely angry after receiving this tip-off. They stated that although the surge in rice prices was due to rising prices at the source and a shortage of supply, Ling Defu dared to take advantage of the situation to raise prices, withhold goods from sale, and incite unrest, which was illegal. Yesterday, an order was issued for his arrest, and he will be transferred to the District Court within days for severe punishment according to law.</p>
<h3>Witness in "Golden Tide" Case Detained; Ying Minghe Suspected of Crimes; Investigation into Possible Collusion and Perjury Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the first public hearing in the "Golden Tide" case at the District Court on April 4, secret investigations have been intensified in recent days. Yesterday, Judge Wang Jiazhuo summoned Zhan Yunsheng at the notary office and summoned Ying Minghe, the actual person in charge of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, Ni Zuguang, the manager of Fang Jiuxia Changji Silver Shop, Xie Bingquan, the manager of Taikangrun Gold Shop, Wang Songtao, the former assistant manager and cashier of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, and Wang Mingju, a shareholder of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, for questioning. According to Zhan Liansheng's testimony, all of Tongfengyu's business and accounts were managed by Ying Minghe, so Judge Wang paid special attention to Ying's interrogation yesterday. The interrogation began at 10:00 AM and ended at 2:00 PM. According to his testimony, Tongfengyu closed its shares in February of the 34th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the capital was 4.5 million yuan in puppet Central Reserve Bank notes, with each share being 300,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Zhan Yunsheng's son, Zhan Dacheng, took two shares, one of which was transferred to Wang Mingju. Further questioning about the various details of the Central Bank's covert sale of gold, Ying's testimony was inconsistent with the testimonies of other witnesses and contained many self-contradictions. Judge Wang believed that Ying Minghe was highly suspected of collusion and perjury, and immediately ordered his temporary detention and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After interrogation by the prosecutor on duty at the District Prosecutor's Office, he was detained at the Sinan Road detention center. The other four witnesses, Ni, Xie, and others, were ordered to return home. At the same time, in order to facilitate further questioning, Zhan Liansheng was transferred to the temporary detention center attached to the District Court on North Zhejiang Road.</p>

According to Yang, these gold and cash items were deposited by others, but he could not provide evidence of the deposits. Also, because Yang Xirong had opened an account at the bank and used cashier's checks to purchase gold, and had overdrawn 1,053,000 yuan from the bank between January 18 and 25 of this year, the Ministry requests the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate according to law.

<h3>Love Triangle Drama; Real Estate Company Manager's Vicious Scheme; Fabricating a Communist Party Transfer Order; Attempting to Frame His Love Rival, the Landlord; Investigation Reveals the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Political Section of the City Police Department received a confidential letter at the beginning of this month, addressed to Zhang Jian, Xinzha Road, containing two mimeographed "transfer orders from the Personnel Section of the Shanghai Communist Party Office", one addressed to a Mr. He, marked with the code "Mi F 144", ordering him to report to Fang Yibi, the team leader at the Shanghai office of the China National Aviation Corporation on Nanjing East Road, and the other addressed to a Mr. Xu, marked with the code "Mi F 145", ordering him to report to Wang Zhaohua, the organizer at 502 Lane 43 Weihaiwei Road. After the police department opened the letters, they paid close attention to the case and immediately sent officers to conduct a secret investigation, but they did not obtain any results. Therefore, on the 14th, they summoned Fang Yibi to the bureau for questioning. Fang denied being a member of the Communist Party, denied being a team leader, and denied knowing Wang Zhaohua. When Wang Zhaohua was questioned, nothing was found either. However, Fang Yibi stated that he had also received an anonymous letter a month ago, signed only with the word "Yuan," slandering his girlfriend Li Yuying. After investigation, it was found that the letter was written by Cao Zhongli, another boyfriend of his girlfriend, attempting to sow discord between the two.</p>
<p>Cao Zhongli is the manager of the Yuan Di real estate company, and his address is the same as Wang Zhaohua's. At this point, the police department understood and immediately summoned Cao Zhongli for questioning and compared his handwriting. Cao knew that his scheme had been exposed and confessed the truth. Fang, Li, and Cao's love triangle had been going on for a long time. Seeing that Fang Yibi and Li Yuying were getting closer and closer, and that he himself was about to fail, Cao Zhongli used an anonymous letter to Fang, fabricating facts to damage Li's reputation, in order to sow discord. However, this plan was seen through by Fang, not only was it ineffective, but it also promoted the combination of Fang and Li. So, he</p>
<p>devised a vicious scheme to frame them. Wang Zhaohua is Cao Zhongli's landlord. Because of a housing dispute, he took this opportunity to slander them together. After the police department understood the facts, they severely reprimanded Cao Zhongli. Cao was also quite remorseful and immediately wrote a letter of repentance and was released on bail. The criminal liability for forgery and false accusation has been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Lai Lingnai, Instigator in the Zang Case, Appeals; Case Concluded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Lai Lingnai, a Spanish national and instigator in the Zang Da'er case, was originally sentenced to one year and nine months in the District Court. The defendant appealed, and the case was concluded in the High Court yesterday. The verdict will be announced on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<p>Lai Lingnai testified yesterday: Because I drank too much, Watercull动手, I did not instigate it and it had nothing to do with me. The prosecutor stood up and said: The appellant's statement is inconsistent. The US sailor and the appellant came out of the dance hall together. The victim was asking him for money. At the time of the 料缠, after the appellant spoke with the US sailor, he suddenly punched the victim. The fact proves that the appellant did instigate the incident. Now the appellant does not admit it and overturns his previous testimony. According to the original trial's application of Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for conviction, and given amnesty and commutation, the sentence is already light. The appellant's grounds for appeal are insufficient. Then defense attorney Le Junwei stated: The testimony of the six witnesses in the first instance is inconsistent and cannot prove instigation. At the same time, the appellant and the US sailor did not know each other. The US sailor has been acquitted. Public opinion mostly refers to the scene. The original judgment's assumption of the case has slightly inappropriate points. Because the appellant cannot be held responsible for the matter, please acquit him. The court ordered the debate to end and set the sentencing date for the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Elder Hongwei's Art Exhibition Opens the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu and his wife, Ms. Huang Zhuoqun, hosted reporters at their residence on Anfu Road yesterday afternoon, introducing Elder Hongwei, Ms. Huang's painting teacher. Ms. Huang has been studying painting with Elder Hongwei for six years. Yesterday she told reporters, "The teacher taught me brush techniques, especially 'double outline,' which requires painstaking effort and is not easy."</p>
<p>Elder Hongwei will hold a preview of over a hundred of her recent meticulously created works tomorrow at the New Life Club, and the official exhibition will open on the 19th at the China Painting Gallery on Chengdu Road.

When the late Chairman Lin was in Chongqing, he wrote an inscription for Elder Hongwei, saying, "She paints flowers with vivid colors that are dazzling, and her spirit is transcendent, truly comparable to the brushwork of Nantian Weng.

<h3>Trial of Former Puppet Statistics Department Vice Minister Xia Zhongming; Vivid Accounts of Atrocities Against Bank of China Employees</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of Xia Zhongming, the suspected traitor and former Vice Minister of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, was heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Judge Ding repeatedly questioned him about the "76th" puppet secret service's arrest and killing of Bank of China employees, and summoned Ma Chunzhuang, a guard at the Bank of China dormitory, and Chen Zhaogui, a messenger, to testify. According to Ma's testimony, "76th" sent 60-70 men one night, the date of which he could not remember, and arrested over 100 Bank of China dormitory employees, who were later released. They then arrested another ten or so, and shot Zhang and Cao, two Bank of China employees, inside the dormitory as a warning before returning them. The court ordered him to look at Xia Zhongming and asked if he was the one who led the arrest. Ma replied that it was difficult to see clearly because of the strict air raid precautions and darkness at the time. Another witness, Chen Zhaogui, testified that he had been arrested by "76th," the date of which he could also not remember, and detained for eighteen days, before being released on March 18th of the lunar calendar. He did not see Xia Zhongming at the time of his arrest, nor did he see him inside "76th." Only Wu Shibao came out and said to us, "Don't be afraid, it has nothing to do with you, you will be released in a few days." Xia Zhongming was then brought up for questioning. Xia claimed that he knew nothing about the arrest of Bank of China employees. He was mostly in Nanjing at the time, and did not know what was happening in Shanghai. The arrests were carried out secretly by Li Shiqun's men, and he was only a translator with no power to intervene in the operations. Defense attorney Chen Zhen stood up and requested that the imprisoned Ye Jiqing, Ye Yaoxian, and Wang Manyun be summoned to testify at the next hearing. The court ordered a postponement of the trial, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Former Puppet Secret Service Guide Handed Over to Police by Victim</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the 14th at approximately 9:00 PM, Jin Quangan handed Chen Qiutao over to the Yangshupu Police Precinct, claiming that Chen served as a guide for a puppet organization's secret service in April 1945. On April 16th of that year, Chen encountered him in Yangshupu and, upon learning that he was participating in the "Special Operations Unit of the Patriotic Army," reported him to the Pingmin Transit Company in Hartung Garden on Jing'an Temple Road, as this company was actually a secret service agency of the puppet Security Command. The next morning, Chen led Li Song and others to arrest him at Room 67 on the third floor of the Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road and transferred him to the puppet Security Command, where he was sentenced to imprisonment. That same afternoon, she led accomplices to arrest his neighbors Zhou Leshi and Wang Chongqing on Chaoyang Road. He only regained his freedom after the victory. Upon questioning Chen Qiutao, she admitted to leading puppet secret service personnel, but denied leading people to arrest Zhou and Wang. The precinct will periodically submit the case to the High Court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Military Radio Station Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>

<h3>General Labor Union Requests Adjustment of Index; Social Affairs Bureau Has Forwarded Request to Central Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to reports, the General Labor Union, due to the recent soaring prices and the fact that workers' lives have been greatly affected by the freezing of the index, has requested the authorities to appropriately adjust the cost of living index without violating the principle of the economic emergency measures program. Yesterday, this reporter visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to inquire about his opinion. According to him, the economic emergency measures program stipulates freezing the cost of living index, and requesting an appropriate adjustment would violate this program. As the Social Affairs Bureau itself, it also hopes to improve the situation so that labor-management disputes can be reduced. However, the Social Affairs Bureau has no authority to make this decision and has forwarded the request to the central government for instructions.</p>
<p>Recently, employees of the Shanghai Power Company, due to difficult living conditions, specifically requested that the company provide a universal cost of living allowance. The Social Affairs Bureau rejected this request, as it amounted to a disguised increase in the cost of living index, which is against the law.</p>
<p>In addition, rickshaw rentals are calculated based on a base rate of sixty cents per vehicle, calculated according to the cost of living index. When the cost of living index was frozen in January, the rental was calculated at 4,750 yuan. Recently, rickshaw operators, due to the soaring prices of hardware materials, requested adjustment of the rental, but the Social Affairs Bureau did not agree due to the frozen index.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation; Legal Clarification</h3>
<p>Inheritance</p>
<p>Wang Yu asks: A is seventy years old, with one son and one daughter. The daughter is married. Both the son and daughter-in-law died last year, leaving behind a granddaughter. Later, a nephew of a collateral relative, B, was adopted as a son. Now there are several legal questions, please answer: (1) Who should inherit A's estate after his death? (2) If B inherits the estate, is he entitled to a special reserved portion? (3) If only the village head was present to certify A's will, is it valid? (4) The will states that B should receive a special reserved portion but must be responsible for funeral expenses. If B does not fulfill this responsibility, can the payment be stopped? (5) Can the will be filed with the court, what are the procedures, and is it necessary for the agency filing the will to investigate property rights? Can a private announcement in the newspaper stating an objection to the property have legal effect?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) A's estate should be legally inherited by his married daughter and the granddaughter who inherits by right of representation. If B has obtained the status of A's adopted son, he can also legally inherit his estate, but his inheritance share is one-half of that of a legitimate child. (2) As A's adopted son, B already has an inheritance share of one-half of that of a legitimate child and is not entitled to a special reserved portion. (3) Witnesses to a will are not limited to relatives, and the village head can also serve as a witness. (4) The will states that B is entitled to a special reserved portion but must be responsible for funeral expenses. If B does not fulfill the funeral responsibilities, payment of the special reserved portion can be stopped. (5) The will can be notarized at the court, and the property must be investigated during notarization. There is no legal basis for applying to the court for filing. (6) A private announcement in the newspaper stating an objection to the property is an expression of opposition and has legal effect.</p>
<h3>About Public Pawnshop Insiders</h3>
<p>This column has received repeated inquiries from readers about the situation of public pawnshops. The following information has been learned:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai's public pawnshops are financial relief agencies organized by the Social Affairs Bureau. The lending rate for each public pawnshop is 2% per month, and the term of the pledge is six months. Due to insufficient funds, the maximum pawn amount per household is temporarily set at 15,000 yuan.

In addition to recovering the principal, interest, and handling fees, any surplus will be notified to the original pawner to be reclaimed upon presentation of the pawn ticket.</p>
<p>(2) There are currently three public pawnshops in the city: The first public pawnshop is located at No. 664 Fangbang Road, Nanshi. The second public pawnshop is located at No. 22 Chengdu North Road, but may be moved to Hongkou due to housing disputes. The third public pawnshop is located at No. 1077 Changshou Road, Caojiadu. None of the public pawnshops have telephone installed yet.</p>

<p>Black Market Prices Rampant for Days, Yarn Market Chips Become Scarce, Yarn Merchants Association Temporarily Suspends Membership Applications.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the black market price of cotton yarn and the listed price of the Textile Construction Company have been diverging daily. Generally, yarn merchants who can obtain a piece of cotton yarn from the spinning company can make a huge profit simply by reselling the purchase permit. Moreover, some manufacturers are using the black market to transfer raw materials for profit. It is reported that chips are scarce in the yarn market these days, and many depend on these people for adjustment. Moreover, yarn merchants are happy to move in because they can still obtain considerable profit by purchasing and handing over to customer groups for sales in the north.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was shouting prices outside the market, and under the monopoly of profiteering merchants, the chips were very scarce. Although the shouting prices were strong, there was a lack of business. The 42-count Blue Phoenix rose to 10.5 million, the 20-count Special Double Horse was 5.7 million yuan, and the Double as Price was 5.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been an increase in applications to register as members of the Yarn Business Association. It is reported that the association currently has 738 registered members. However, only about 600 are actually operating. Of these, only about 200 are genuine yarn merchants. The rest are mostly merchants who deal in both yarn and cloth or brokers. However, only over 300 are registered with the Textile Construction Company to receive yarn allocation rights. In order to assist the authorities in managing yarn prices and to conduct investigations of applications for membership to the association, as well as to organize various affairs of the members, the association has temporarily suspended applications for membership since the 15th. Those who have already received application forms but have not yet submitted them to the association must submit them within three days, otherwise, applications will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Yarn Sales Process: [Our Report] A responsible person from the business office of the China Textile Construction Company must explain the company's repeated routine allocation and sale of yarn and cloth. He said: In the past half month, the prices of yarn and cloth in this city have been rising steadily, while the price of cotton yarn sold by the company has adhered to the regulations of the authorities and has not changed. The prices of cloth sold are also lower than the market price. Moreover, the allocation and sale of these yarns and cloths have never been interrupted. The quantity of each allocation and sale has also remained balanced. However, the market price has been rising endlessly, resulting in a widening gap with the company's listed price. According to the current difference, each time the company sells yarn, it receives approximately 2-3 billion yuan less, calculated at the market price difference. Each time cloth is sold, it receives approximately 600-700 million yuan less. This difference in reduced revenue is all taken advantage of by intermediaries, providing no benefit to direct consumers and representing a loss to the national treasury. However, the outside world does not understand the truth and instead blames the Textile Construction Company for not selling effectively. He also listed the amount by which the prices of yarn and cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company from April 1st to the 15th were lower than market prices for reference. For 20-count yarn, the price difference each day was: 2nd, 350,000 yuan; 4th, 400,000 yuan; 7th, 750,000 yuan; 9th, 780,000 yuan; 11th, 750,000 yuan; 14th, 1,550,000 yuan. For 42-count thread, the price difference each day was: 2nd, 1,200,000 yuan; 4th, 1,100,000 yuan; 7th, 1,500,000 yuan; 9th, 1,550,000 yuan; 11th, 1,550,000 yuan; 14th, 2,850,000 yuan. For 12-pound fine cloth, the price difference each day was: 1st, 4,500 yuan; 3rd, 5,000 yuan; 5th, 6,500 yuan; 8th, 18,000 yuan; 10th, 15,000 yuan; 12th, 26,000 yuan; 15th, 27,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Recently, people in the community have expressed deep concern about the high price of yarn and the insufficient supply of raw cotton. This reporter specially consulted Mr. Xi Yushu, who said: The purchase price of cotton yarn and the free sale price of manufacturers should be as close as possible; otherwise, manufacturers will raise the free sale price in order to compensate for the losses caused by the low purchase price, regardless of the government's purpose of purchasing, it will have an adverse effect on prices directly and indirectly. As for a reasonable purchase price, it can be listed as follows: 3.5 dan of raw cotton + 1.14 million yuan + manufacturing cost + 15% unified tax = reasonable purchase price for each purchase. As for the supply of raw cotton, since September of last year, cotton textile industry personnel in this city have been calling loudly and consulting with Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, hoping that the government can be prepared. After Mayor Wu, who also served as the head of the Textile Control Commission, took office last October, cotton textile industry personnel again requested the government to guarantee the continuous supply of raw cotton. However, by February of this year, the government had not ordered any foreign cotton in this half-year period. From the government's perspective, there were practical difficulties, but for the sake of the entire national economy, it is hoped that the authorities will have a long-term vision and have a complete plan. As for the cotton provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), totaling 160,000 bales, approximately 50,000 bales have already arrived in this port.</p>

They requested that prices be appropriately relaxed and that the ban on purchasing gold bars be lifted; otherwise, they hoped that the central government could allocate them at official prices.

<p>Food Prices Continue to Rise; Social Affairs Bureau Will Change to Selling White Rice; China Trust Bureau Agrees to Allocate Saigon Rice to the City.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The rice market continued to rise yesterday due to the high prices in the producing areas. A total of 4,752 stones of rice arrived in the north and south markets. The Social Affairs Bureau released 2,890 bags of red glutinous rice at a price of 120,500 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>Ji Mingqi, the head of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, met with Mayor Wu at 3:00 PM yesterday to request instructions on measures to suppress rice prices. It is reported that the China Trust Bureau has agreed to allocate approximately 30,000 to 50,000 bags of medium-grade Saigon rice to the city from today for sale on the market in order to suppress the rising prices. The selling price is to be announced temporarily this morning by Section Chief Ji after he arrives at the market, and it will be lower than the market price, approximately 110,000 yuan per stone. The Social Affairs Bureau has strict regulations for rice stores and rice merchants to avoid hoarding and ensure that citizens can truly benefit.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Arriving Soon: Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the bureau will sell white japonica rice when necessary, so that it and red glutinous rice will appear in the market in rotation. The main problem currently is still asking the Jiangsu Provincial Government to effectively assist in suppressing prices in the producing areas. Tens of thousands of tons of foreign rice will arrive by the end of April, and another 100,000 tons will be imported in May. Vice Minister Pang of the Ministry of Food has agreed to allocate a portion to Shanghai to stabilize rice prices.</p>
<p>White Yuan Rising Wildly: Yesterday, more than 4,700 stones of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. The prices in various producing areas rose sharply, and local prices followed suit. Japonica and glutinous rice became a rare commodity, continuing to soar by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

<p>Qingdao Yarn and Cloth Soaring: [Central News Agency, Qingdao, 16th] Qingdao is a yarn and cloth producing area. Recently, speculative capital from various places has poured in, and yarn and cloth prices have fluctuated sharply. 20-count cloth has risen to 220,000 yuan per bolt, and yarn has risen to 5.6 million yuan per piece. It is reported that the reasons for the price increases are: (1) Merchants are transporting goods out for profit. In the past month, the Jiaohai Customs exported over 11,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 360,000 bolts of cloth, far exceeding Qingdao's production. (2) Affected by the soaring prices of yarn and cloth in Tianjin and Yingkou. (3) The prices of raw cotton, coal, hardware, and other materials have increased more than threefold compared to mid-January, while yarn and cloth have only increased twofold. (4) At the beginning of this month, the Qingdao branch of the China Textile Corporation suspended 100,000 spindles due to the interruption of Western raw cotton supply, resulting in supply falling short of demand. Now, the company's raw cotton has arrived, and it is striving to restore raw cotton production and is consulting with the Qingdao Municipal Government on provisional measures for the allocation and sale of yarn and cloth to meet the needs of citizens and line cloth twill factories and production cooperatives.</p>
<p>Tianjin Bans Yarn and Cloth Exports: [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] Tianjin's yarn and cloth prices have been soaring for two months. To crack down on speculation, the municipal authorities issued measures on the 15th to control the sale of yarn and cloth, prohibiting exports to Qingdao and Shanghai. Exports to the Northeast, except for the return sales by the China Textile Corporation and the permission for merchants to provide security to exchange cloth for grain, are also prohibited, and public price negotiation is implemented.</p>
<p>National Bank and China Trust Bureau Order Coal from the United States: Estimated 50,000 Tons, Transportation Issues Under Consideration</p>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the Central Bank and the China Trust Bureau have decided to order 50,000 tons of bituminous coal from the United States and Canada in order to replenish the city's coal reserves so that they can be adjusted when coal is in short supply. The price of this coal is approximately US$20 per ton in the United States if we transport and load it ourselves. If we entrust the United States to transport and load it, the price per ton in Shanghai is approximately US$35, requiring a total foreign exchange outlay of US$1.75 million. It is heard that the transportation issue is currently under consideration. After the coal arrives in Shanghai, it will be temporarily stockpiled for emergency allocation and sale.</p>
<p>Coal Dust Continues to Rise: The market for bituminous coal dust is still tending to be brisk. The price of Kaiping No. 1 has been quoted at 700,000 yuan. Bituminous coal lumps are also stable and firm, with more people inquiring. Tongmei, which had been sluggish for a long time, has also rebounded, with the price rising to 670,000 to 680,000 yuan. The market for various types of white coal is still stable, and market prices have not fluctuated much.</p>
<p>Holders of US Dollar Bonds Can Freely Remit Foreign Exchange Earnings</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance: Article 5 of the Regulations on US Dollar Bonds of the 36th Year of the Republic explicitly stipulates that "the principal and interest of this bond shall be paid in US dollar foreign exchange by the National Government." The Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Central Bank and the Import Management Committee in accordance with this stipulation. The payment of the principal and interest of the public bond will be left to the discretion of the bondholders, and they may be freely remitted without restriction. Bondholders may also use this foreign exchange to order various goods from abroad within the scope of the Import Management Regulations and import them into the country. If the goods purchased are production tools or production raw materials, the Import Management Committee should provide special facilitation.</p>
<p>Money Supply in This City is Tightening: In the past week, the money supply in this city has not been as loose as in the past. Over the past two days, speculative capital has become slightly active, and the money supply is tending to tighten. According to yesterday's exchange, the amount that various banks and Zhuang were lending to the national bank was 1.7 billion yuan, which is gradually tightening compared to the more than 1 billion yuan that was being lent out two weeks ago. However, compared to the previous 25 billion yuan that was being lent out to the national bank, it is still a big difference. It is heard that the reason for the slight tightening of the money supply this time is that price fluctuations are a factor. In addition, the fact that businesses had to pay income tax before the 15th of this month, which was also a major reason. According to financial industry sources: the government is determined to stabilize prices, and the money supply will not be excessively tightened. However, it is expected that before the end of the month, in order to catch up with the interest on the US dollar treasury bonds for this month, the purchase of treasury bonds will definitely be enthusiastic, and a large amount of speculative capital will be absorbed at that time, and the money supply may be more likely to tighten.</p>
<p>Dyestuffs Climbing to New Highs: Under the stimulation of certain positive news in recent days, although market sales have not been very prosperous, market prices have climbed to new highs. Yesterday and today, the prices of Wuma vermilion, vulcanized yuan, and water indigo have been soaring, and there is no possibility of stabilization.</p>
<p>Hardware Flat After Being Brisk: The hardware market, which had been climbing to new highs in recent days, has now stabilized slightly. However, barbed wire cloth is in season, and the price is still rising continuously. Lead wire is also very firm.</p>
<p>Fir Timber Price Increases Have Stopped: The price of fir timber previously rose due to high prices in the Fujian producing area and because sales in Shanghai were brisk and people were encouraged. This increase had reached 15%, but yesterday the price increase stopped. Sellers of foreign pine also have a positive outlook due to the high price of fir.</p>
<p>Biluochun New Crop Arrives: Among various domestic teas, in addition to Longjing and Dafang, the Biluochun produced in Dongting Mountain is also a famous and expensive green tea. Every year, it has been selling well on this street. The new crop for this year has finally arrived in Shanghai, which the various stores have been eagerly awaiting. It is heard that the price among the industry is 36,000 yuan per catty for Dongshan goods and 24,000 to 5,000 yuan per catty for Xishan goods, and sales are very brisk. As for the new Longjing from Wenzhou and Hangzhou, the market is softening again because the goods arriving are becoming more mature. As for domestic aged tea, the market continues to be the same because purchases and sales are about equal, regardless of quality. Buyers in the foreign tea market are still trying to suppress prices, and sellers are reluctant to sell, so trading has decreased sharply, and the situation remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Dutch Quinine Resumes Production: During the war, Dutch quinine bark could not be exported, and there was a shortage everywhere in the world.

<p>Dispute Between Southern Goods and Other Four Industries: Social Affairs Bureau's Handling Measures.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Southern Goods Industry Association of this city recently reported to the economic supervision agency that the United Office of the Seafood, Northern Goods, and Longan Industry Associations was illegally organizing and monopolizing the source of goods, hindering the economy, and raising prices. The Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau specially summoned the responsible persons of the three industries for questioning yesterday afternoon. Four handling measures were decided: (1) The boycott by fellow traders should cease immediately. (2) The鏢期 (escort payment) method will be decided after convening the four industries for consultation. (3) The United Office of the Seafood, Northern Goods, and Longan Industry Associations will be banned. (4) The matter of price increases for seafood will be thoroughly investigated by sending personnel.</p>
<p>According to Director Wu, the United Office of the three industries has not been registered according to law, so it will be banned. As for the Southern Goods Industry's accusation of monopolizing the market and raising prices, if the investigation is true, they will be dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Asks to Raise Interest Rates; Receives Reply from Ministry of Finance: The Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting to raise the legal interest rate in order to guide speculative capital into the right track. In addition to the previous instructions from the Ministry of Justice, it received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "We have received your telegram. The bank interest rate should be handled in accordance with the 'Regulations on the Management of Bank Deposit and Loan Interest Rates' promulgated by the National Government, which is a legal interest rate and not just an administrative remedy. Moreover, Article 4 of the regulations clearly stipulates that 'If the bank loan interest rate exceeds the discount rate of the Central Bank on that day, the creditor has no right to claim the excess.' According to the legal principle that special law takes precedence over general law, the debtor shall not use Article 205 of the Civil Code as a reason for litigation against the bank interest rate. As for other agreed or unagreed interest rates, they will still apply before the relevant articles in the Civil Code and the Negotiable Instruments Law are amended, but if their original effect is obviously unfair. There are remedial measures in the 'Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery.' Special reply is hereby given."</p>

As for the 14,000 tons of oil extraction raw materials supplied by the China Trust Bureau each month, there are no problems now, and it is expected to be implemented monthly. The oil mills can rest assured about this. Also, for the general needs of the citizens, the Cooking Oil Joint Distribution Office has decided to resume distribution from today (17th), with the price being 400,000 yuan per load. The retail price at the store is 4,400 yuan per catty. This negotiated price will be reduced immediately after raw materials arrive in Shanghai continuously and production increases. All retailers who receive the allocated oil should supply it all for store sales and should not exceed the price limit. Anyone who violates this will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that the oil market was still supplying at flat prices yesterday, but the delivery was not fast. Stores were in tight demand, and there was little movement outside the market.</p>

<p>500,000 Japanese Soldiers Deported to Siberia Translated by Our Office</p>
<p>Because time was tight and transportation was lacking, the Soviet army still desperately used tanks to transport precision machinery, resulting in 20% of it being damaged.</p>
<p>In addition to the execution or deportation to Siberia of over a hundred prominent anti-Soviet figures such as Semenov, the remaining White Russians have become the Soviet Union's fifth column in the Northeast.</p>
<p>General Stankaevich First Reveals the Truth About the Soviet Army in the Northeast</p>
<p>In the looted and war-torn city of Shenyang, stands a tall granite monument, topped with a bronze model of a Soviet-style tank. The monument is inscribed with these words: "Eternal glory to the martyrs of the tank corps who sacrificed their lives for the Soviet victory in defeating Japanese imperialism."</p>
<p>This is not only a monument commemorating ten Soviet heroes of the war, but also a symbol of the Soviet expedition to the Northeast.</p>
<p>This corner of Northeast China was once one of the world's largest granaries, a major producer of Chinese coal and iron, and the industrial center of Asia. But today's Northeast is unrecognizable. When Japan surrendered, it was still "untouched," but after the Soviet Union "took over" for eighteen months, the Northeast became a mess. Except for Lushun and Dalian, strategic areas that the Soviet Union seemed to want to permanently occupy, no place was spared. Industrialized Northeast has been stripped of all its industrial equipment and turned into a scorched earth.</p>
<p>Swollen Corpses Float, Contested by Dogs</p>
<p>The author personally witnessed the situation in the Northeast under Soviet occupation, during the final days of the largest looting in modern history. Endless trains and ships were seen loaded with grain, machinery, and raw materials heading towards the Soviet Union. Under the watchful eyes of the Red Army, the author accompanied the first group of Chinese receiving personnel to the Northeast, touring the ruins of Shenyang after the looting.</p>
<p>We arrived in Shenyang as uninvited guests, but General Stankaevich, the commander of the Soviet army in the Northeast, warmly welcomed us and accommodated us in the luxurious Yamato Hotel. Although there was no hot water (because the Soviets had dismantled the generators), the food was delicious, and there was plenty of Japanese beer.</p>
<p>Shenyang had become a filthy and dangerous city. In the suburbs, we saw several swollen and blackened corpses, with dogs fighting over them. These corpses had been exposed for months, their faces blurred, and their nationality could not be identified. According to the Chinese who accompanied us, in the first few days of the terror, the Soviet army killed foreigners indiscriminately, regardless of whether they were friends or foes. They had buried 6,000 corpses in the three weeks since their arrival in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Garbage piles were everywhere in Shenyang, making cleanup work extremely difficult. General Stankaevich estimated that there were about 400,000 tons of garbage piled up throughout the city, and several roads were completely blocked by garbage. Although the authorities intended to clear the garbage, they lacked vehicles for transportation. All 600 buses in the city had disappeared, only twelve of the 200 trams remained, and all private vehicles had been requisitioned by the Red Army.</p>
<p>In its heyday, Shenyang's industry accounted for 40% of the entire Northeast's industry, and Northeast's industry was roughly equivalent to the rest of China. Shenyang produced 4 million tons of steel and 3.5 million tons of synthetic oil annually, mined 15 million tons of coal from the nearby Fushun coal mine, manufactured 100 aircraft per month, and had factories for automobiles, textiles, rubber, and Asia's largest tobacco factory. According to the Japanese, Shenyang's warehouses stored 5.6 million tons of supplies. Now, all of this is gone.</p>
<p>Dismantling Work Rushed</p>
<p>During the fourteen years of Japanese occupation of the Northeast, Shenyang and all the industrial areas of the Northeast were built from the ground up. The imperial government and Japanese business tycoons invested huge sums of money and built many industrial zones around the ancient city. When the Soviet army entered, Shenyang had 1,500 factories, of which 900 employed more than 200 workers. Now, two-thirds of the small factories have been dismantled, and 90% of the large factories have been damaged or completely destroyed. The large factories were of course solely owned by the Japanese, while the small factories often had Chinese investment.</p>
<p>We spoke with many Chinese, Japanese, and White Russian residents who witnessed or helped the Red Army move industrial equipment from the Northeast.</p>

<p>Railway Scores a Goal in One and a Half Minutes</p>
<p>Before the start of the match, the two sides took a group photo. Wang Zhaohuai, President of the Railway Sports Association, presented a pennant to the visiting team. The two team captains, Zhang Qu and Lin Changzhi, shook hands. The match officially started at 5:00 PM. The visiting team got the ball and attacked first. An Zhongxiu took a shot from the left corner, Zhang Qu easily caught it and passed it to the front. Xiao Ziwen passed it from the left corner. Li Yao passed it from 80 yards away from the goal to the center. Unexpectedly, the ball was too high, and Hong Deyong's vision was blocked by the sunlight, so it jumped into the net, 1-0. The Railway team opened the scoring, only one and a half minutes after the start of the match.</p>
<p>Seoul Falls Again After Losing Two Goals</p>
<p>Seoul's counterattack was unsuccessful. In the 12th minute, a visiting team defender, eager to save the ball at 30 yards, used his hand to touch the ball. Fei Chunhua took a free kick, Xiao Ziwen waited in front of the goal and added a kick. Hong Deyong was stunned, and the ball had already entered the net. The visiting team lost another city, 2-0. In the 35th minute, the Seoul team saw that the situation was not good and replaced Zheng Guozhen and Zheng Nanxi, but the battle was still controlled by the Railway team. The first half ended with the Railway team leading 2-0.</p>
<p>Mutual Attacks, No Achievements</p>
<p>In the second half, Seoul counterattacked. Railway goalkeeper Zhang Qu blocked the shots from the left and right, saving the day. In the 10th minute, the Railway team's luck turned around, and the attack was fierce, but it was unsuccessful. In the 18th minute, Railway defender Xu Shengxuan left the field to rest and was replaced by Cao Liming. At this time, the Railway team's key defensive position suddenly became tense. In the 20th minute, Zheng Guozhen shot from the crowd eight yards in front of the Railway goal, but unfortunately, the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. The visiting team's failure to score this goal was fate and luck. The melee continued until the 28th minute. Fei Chunhua and Lu Qingxiang cooperated and attacked again, but they were all saved by the enemy defense. Li Yao's shot flew out like a shooting star, but it was a little off the mark. Eight minutes before the end of the match, the visiting team attacked again, but the Railway team put all its efforts into defense, to no avail. The Seoul team eventually suffered a defeat with a score of 2-0.</p>
