<p>艾克遜續在外委會解釋　美有援助希土必要　力言此舉符合聯合國憲章　美國不贊成中國共產勢力之擴展　　〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜今日在衆院外交委員會就杜魯門總統援助希臘土耳其抵抗共產主義一案，繼續陳述意見，謂「美國不贊成中國境內共條政府之擴張，希土兩國政府若由共產黨控制將危及美國安全」。據若干記者所知，艾氏當時言論曾指世界各地所有共產黨控制政府均足以危及美國安全，但官方記錄則僅提及希臘與土耳其兩國。共和黨眾議員裘特詢以中國境內共產黨控制之政府是否危及美國安全？艾氏答稱：「余認爲吾人不致贊成此一政府。全世界各地共產黨組織均遵照高度紀律與一致性行事，決非巧合」。共和黨衆議員梅洛則主張與產黨互相攤牌，並謂「除非美國採取強硬立場，史達林先生及其同僚不致停止其侵略性之擴張計劃」。艾氏允於日後公佈有關希土兩國局勢之秘密文件，即昨日提供各委員傳觀者，且力言政府並無援助其他國家之「秘密計劃」。美國援助希土並非「主張恢復强權政策之均勢」，希臘申請美國援助亦不表示「聯今國機構業已失敗」。渠避免直接牽涉蘇聯之種種問題。或問「此一法案是否爲對蘇聯之打擊，是否爲對共產主義之打擊，是否爲對希臘游擊隊之打擊」？艾氏答稱：此僅打擊「企圖分化國家之軍隊」。渠又稱：吾人若聽任希臘破裂，不久將有「人民委員」控制該國。蘇聯堅持參迢韃靼尼爾海峽防禦事宜乃土耳其之「外來壓力」。同時，參院外交委員會主席范登堡與民主黨參議員康納利提出援助希土法案序文，內稱美國援助該二國「將對聯合國各會員國之自由與獨立大有貢獻」。范氏並稱：「該序文旨在證明美國遵守聯合國憲章」。　　〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕美國代理國務卿艾克遜，昨日在眾議院外交委員會陳述意見之後，本日又出席該會會議，答覆各議員所提出之質問。艾克遜稱：國會業已核准貸款菲律濱。美國進出口銀行已撥款五萬萬美元，準備貸予中國，用之於復興事業。美國並已將貸款預付義國，俾協助該國復興其經濟。此種決定，均並不違反聯合國憲章之條款。國會若否決對希貸款，或遲暹不予批准，則「人民委員長」之制度，即將在希臘出現矣。世界各處之共產黨，組織行動均有紀律，且完全一致云。最後共和黨衆議員裘特表示，自一九二〇年以還，保加利亞現任內閣總理狄米特羅夫，法國共產黨領袖杜克洛克及中國共產黨領袖毛澤東，均爲國際共產黨執行委員會委員，吾人對比，不能不表示焦慮云。英繼續援希　　〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕倫敦方面據英政府人士稱：該國擬援助希臘對遊擊隊發動春季攻勢，且在美國未予援　　〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕頃自此間探悉：杜魯門總統已準備致函聯合國，解釋美國援助希臘與土耳其二國之計劃。據國會方面稱，此因國會反對其「傷害」聯合國之權限，故總統作此兩以慰國會人士之情緒，聞此函將由美國首席代表奧斯汀送交聯合國。　　〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕外間謠傳杜魯門總統已致函聯合國，解釋美國對希臘問題之態度，此說業經白宮昨夜加以否認。欲求美蘇融洽　蘇須改變作風　美權威人士見解　　〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕據權威人士今日聲稱：莫斯科官方對杜魯門總統援助希土提案之反響，漸認爲美國推行完全反蘇政策。蘇聯方面如果流行此種見解，殊屬不幸，因其毫無根據，美國人民並不反蘇，且母寗欲使兩國問之關係保持友好基礎。發動世界革命，破壞其他各式政府，使各該國投入蘇聯　拘之內，此種共產主義之侵略行爲，美國誠然反對，但美國不反對蘇聯或其他確實需要各國之共產主義。美國所反對者厥爲迫令無需共產主義之弱國接受共產主義。美國承認在一境國內，共產主義與西方民主政治無法融合。彼等互相有害。惟英國仍希望在鄰國境內二者或可並行不悖。此點目前尙未達到，其原因蓋在共產主義之侵略無遠弗屆，欲使其他各國全部共產化。共產主義若能採取和平手段，事態或將改觀，惜共產主義所應用者乃直接行動之布爾什維克理論，要求以武力推　政府，而非以投票方式。故英美提出抗議，反對蘇聯干涉匈牙利內政，並譴責本年一月波蘭在共產黨所控制之臨時政府　　下辦理選舉，諸如此類，例不勝舉。欲使目前局勢不再緊張，惟一途徑即由蘇聯宣佈停止企圖憑藉布爾什維克手段擴張勢力國，且將其諾言付之實現。自德取獲賠償品　英提出清單　　〔中央社莫斯科廿一日專電〕英外相員文本日在外長會議中宣讀關於聯合王國業已獲得之賠償品報吿，在分配英國之價値四百四十萬馬克之工業機械之設備中，英國已獲得價値一百五十萬馬克之物品，以及約値二十萬鎊之機械，充技術研究之用。英國已獲卅五萬噸船隻，計値六百卅五萬鎊，在英國之德國財產估計爲一千五百萬至二千萬鎊，現由盟國賠償機構管制中，將根據巴黎賠償協定予以分配。對德國政制問題　蘇突主地方分權　法反對設德臨時政府　　〔本報訊〕莫斯科廿二日廣播：蘇外長莫洛托夫今日在外長會議中，突改變原來態度，主張未來德國政府採取地方分權制。謂德國議會應予恢復，實行兩院制。德政體必須具有民主性質，政權必須以民主選舉爲基礎云。　　〔本報訊〕莫斯科廿一日廣播：今日，法外長在會議中對美英蘇主張成立德國臨時政府一節，表示異議，認爲此事目前時機尙未成熟云。　　〔聯合社莫斯科廿二日電〕據可靠消息，法外長皮杜爾將在今日下午外長會議首先發言，提議使德國政體退回一百年，恢復一八四八年弗蘭克福憲法，樹立地方分權之聯邦制，並採用一院制議會，議員由各邦議會推選，任期四年。蘇聯則主張中央集權。英國亦主張採用聯邦制，惟其性質居於法蘇提案之間。美國務卿馬歇爾並主張立即設立臨時政府，且擬加以補充說明。英外相貝文所提意見已頗詳盡，主張最後設立之中央政府應設總統一人，由憲法規定其職權，議會則採兩院制，一院代表全國人民，另一院代表各邦及最高法院，全部權力應賦予各邦，由憲法明白規定賦予中央政府者除外。屬於中央政府之職權爲履行條約，管理專利與版權，國外貿易，某種賦稅及調節銀行事業。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫亦將提出詳細方案，說明其中央集權主張。四國對奧和約　可望成立協議　　外長會議今夜對於德國政體雖發生三角鬥爭，但就今日形勢觀之，對奧和約頗有成立協議之望。建設性之方案可望於下星期初絡續提出。　　〔路透社莫斯科廿一日電〕外長會議今日決定邀請奧國代表來莫斯科，陳述奧國條約之意見。耶兒達波茨坦協定　全文定今明日公佈　　〔合衆社華盛頓二十二日電〕在國會壓力下，美國務院今日已同意在最近公布羅·史·邱之耶爾達與波茨坦協定之全文。據衆院外委會委員蔡達特稱，協定全文公布後，可澄淸許多對援助土希目的懷疑之空氣，耶爾達秘密協定之一爲關於中國部分。蒙氏又謂，協定原望於今日公佈，然國務院稱，約在星期日或星期一公佈。蘇聯禁國人　與外人通婚　　〔聯合社莫斯科廿二日電〕最高蘇維埃今日宣布禁止俄人與外國人通婚，原因未說明。戰時蘇聯女子與英美人結婚者甚多。法閣潮轉危為安　共產黨態度轉變擁護政府　胡志明再度呼籲停戰　　〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕國民議會今晨開會，當以五一一票對零票，通過對越軍費案，共產黨各部長加入其他各黨擁護此案。迫切之閣漸，乃切實得以避免其他共產黨議員則放棄投票。共黨各部長之決定擁護政府，乃該黨領袖杜克洛斯在辯論時宣布。先是共產黨國會代表團發表公吿稱：共黨議員之不參加投票，並非懷疑政府一般政策之其他部份，故共產黨各部長並無理由破壞現內閣之團結性。　　〔路透社巴黎廿一日電〕胡志明總統向法政府之緊急呼籲電，已遞達越盟之巴黎代表團，將轉交法國政府。內容鄭重表示：越盟祗願在法國聯邦內取得統一與獨立，對於法國在越盟區內之經濟文化利益，決予尊重，目前祗須法國政府一言，即可停止戰爭。法國若不顧越盟之誠意，繼續作戰，則雙方仇恨必更加深，法國必將喪失一切，一無所得。法殖民部發言人謂渠尙未接獲此一電報，僅目電台獲悉之，惟覺越盟代表團與越南之越盟政府甚少接觸，吾人認要求停戰，應由越南之越盟政府爲之。越軍退入奧境　已被我軍拘禁　　〔法國新聞社河內廿一日電〕官方頃宣佈：越盟士兵自蒙開撤退，企圖越過邊界，而至廣東省內，被當地駐軍拘禁，已達一百餘名云。　　〔法國新聞社河內廿一日電〕官方頃發表公報稱：法軍刻在東京三角地蒂之北部進行重要軍事行動，一路順利，越軍一隊在廣東省邊境諒山公路與天延公路槍刧，向北竄越，聞已被中國軍隊擊潰。美對韓政策　刻在考慮中　　〔法國新聞社華盛頓二十一日電〕國務院發言人頃宣稱：美國政府刻正研究一項計劃，俾在朝鮮實施美國之政策，美國政府擬改善朝鮮之經濟情形，逐漸使朝鮮人民能自行處理其行政，深望朝鮮即能成為自主與獨立之國家，朝鮮獨立黨領袖李承晩最近發表聲明。謂美國佔領區內即將舉行普選，此說純屬臆測，並無事寶根據。至此有人問曰：美國是否準備在朝鮮自行其事，而不顯及朝鮮已分成二個佔領區之一項事實？國務院發言人答稱：美國政府準備就朝鮮之統一問題，與　　〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕朝鮮南部獨立領袖李承晩今日聲稱：朝鮮南部將於三十至六十日內高立「臨時獨立政府」，並由文職高級事員替代目前之美國軍事總督。今後美國總統　僅能連任一次　　參衆兩院通過法案　　〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕衆院本日通過一項法案，規定美國總統僅能連任一次，並規定若遇前任總統任期未滿而由副總統繼任滿二年以上者，不得連任，惟杜魯門總統在此項法案通邊之前，早已爲總統，故不受此項法案之限制。按此項法案業經參院通過，將爲美國憲法第廿二條修正條款，須得美全國各州四分之三之批准始能成立。蒙巴頓抵印　魏菲兒臨別贈言　　〔合衆社德里廿二日電〕印度新總督蒙巴頓業於今日自倫敦飛抵此間，即與魏菲爾會談，待魏氏明日啓程回國後，繭巴頓即將於下週一正式視事。　　〔合衆社倫敦廿一日電〕魏菲爾元帥今日自新德里發表最後一次廣播演說，向印度吿別，略謂：余相信印度軍隊安定，必能成爲印度將來之決定因素。余亦白知過去治理印度，犯有過失，但余常爲促進印度之自治，而堅苦工作。余係軍人，故今日之吿別詞，亦惟能作軍人之言，茲特向印度人民吿別，誠意爲印度人民祝福。余之繼承人，才幹出衆，相信其必能爲印度造福。印度前途雖堅苦，但諸君常能加以征服云。艾帥預定今春　視察北極防務　　〔合眾社華盛頓廿二日電〕美參謀總長艾森豪威爾今日宣稱：在春季氣候轉暖後彼願往北極前綫視察防禦設施，而目前在下星期內起，艾帥將視華盛頓與沿東海岸之軍事設備。　　〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕美陸軍航空司令部今日宣布，陸軍Ｂ29型飛機一架，本星期飛越北極，考測氣候，今後或將經常担負氣候報吿工作。按美國與加拿大最近宣布，將在加北部建築氣象台七處，作爲美加氣象與聯防計劃之一部。英阿糾紛案　將由安理會裁決　　〔法國新聞社成功湖廿二日電〕關於柯孚海峽水雷事件，聯合國人士預料安理會將判定阿兒巴尼亞政府知有埋雷一事，但並非出於故意，故英國申訴二艘軍艦所受之損失及海軍人員所受之死傷，恐不能被視爲完全合法。且英代表賣德幹向安理會所提出之證據，多數代表皆認爲未見充份。除蘇聯與波蘭外，多以爲海峽內所埋之水雷，並非故意賦設，但阿爾巴亞政府常然知有其事，故衆料安理會常將根據此原則，判定其是非。至蘇聯對此將否使用其否決權，則尙不得而知，安理會下次會議定週二舉行。希遊擊隊盤踞阿邊境　政府軍大舉進攻　聯合國代表團赴保邊界調查　　〔聯合社雅典廿二日電〕據拉里薩前綫今日消息。希臘政府軍第十五師，昨日請晨已在空軍與砲隊掩護下，向盤踞阿兒巴尼亞邊境附近格拉驟山　之希臘遊擊隊大舉進攻，予以重床。攻勢原擬早日開始，因聯合國調查蘇聯與波蘭代表遷留該處而展延。　　〔法國新聞社南斯拉夫京城廿一日電〕聯合國調查巴爾幹問題代表團，定於廿三日前往希保兩國邊界，賡續進行調查工作，預料卅一日行抵保京。荷蘭所扣美船　已準裝貨放行　　〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務院宣布，荷蘭政府已同意聽任美貨船「斐兒門」號加倍裝貨，自荷屬東印度巴達維亞港開出。解決辦法中規定對輪船公司及船員作公平賠償，並補償延擱期間之損失。國務院聲明承認荷蘭政府行動合法，但事件之解決，係本於雙方傳統的敦陸精神。又悉：英貨船遭受荷當局檢查一事，英國提出抗議後，荷臨已予答復，謂此舉遵照國際公法與荷蘭領海管理條例辦理。遠東經濟委員會　會員國代表決定　　〔法國新聞社成功湖廿一日軍〕聯合國經社理事會今日決定，遼東經濟委員會之代表將包括中·美·英·蘇·法·澳·荷·菲一律濱。印度與暹羅各國。該委會一負責研究遠東各國戰後復興計劃巴拉圭判軍　兩路迫京城　　〔法國新聞社阿根廷巴拉圭邊界波薩達斯城廿一日電〕據巴拉圭叛軍控制區傳來消息：叛軍業已發動攻勢，以巴拉圭京城亞森松為其目標，巴拉圭河上游奈格拉地方之海軍基地，己陷入叛軍手中，叛軍刻正自西面及北面發動鉗形攻勢。日本的生活近狀  陳訓悆　　本報總編輯陳訓念先生日昨於編輯部同人聚餐會中，曾就此次赴日觀光所得，對日本食衣住行等方面有所報吿，經本報記者周班侯君筆錄後，特先爲發表於此。至關於此次赴日考察之整個材料，陳先生正在整理中，不日可於本報陸續刋出。　　余等應麥帥之邀，前往日本，行程共十八日，除往返各一日，並在朝鮮漢城逗留三日外，計在日本逗留十三日。麥帥邀請中國記者團前往之動機，早在日本發生澀谷事件之際，是時國內各報，對此事件頗多批評，輒以爲麥帥對待日人，失之過寬。麥帥以國人對其管制日本之政策，未盡了解，遂與我國駐日代表團朱團長世明相商，朱團長以中日交通困難，故國人對日本情形易生隔膜，不妨竟邀中國記者，、前來參觀，必可有裨於實際情形之瞭解，麥帥遂於邀請美國霍華德系報紙各負責人遊日之後，正式邀請我國新聞界赴日，此赴日記者團之山來也。　　余等抵東京後，宿於戰前最華貴之帝國旅館，此實日本政治舞台上最高級人士之所居，食宿汽車，均由麥帥總部供應。繼自東京而至京都，大阪，廣島，鐵道特掛專車五列，內三列爲臥舖，一列爲餐室，一列爲應接室，一行十人，甚感寬舒。至橫濱時，並有美憲兵吉普車護衛，三車前導，二車殿後，頗有招搖過市之感。京都並特別戒嚴，且臨時於街側以繩索攔出人行道，故不知者必以爲余等係極重要之使節，知者亦殆必亦以余等所受之隆重招待而感歆羡矣。余等接見賓客，規定行程，均極自由，毫無拘束。日相吉田茂曾抽暇延見，議會各黨派領袖亦皆與余等相見，並舉行坐談會焉。　國人必極關心於日本在大戰中破壞之程度。余等雖因時問匆促，未能盡歷日本各大都市，然以所至之京濱區（東京橫濱），京阪神區（京都，大阪，神戶）及橫須賀港而論，則破壞程度，商業區較小，政治區中之大建築物均未破壞（議會損毀甚微，皇宮毫無損傷），而自東京至續濱之京濱公路上一帶工業區，則幾破壞凈盡，竟可謂爲一望無際，損失極爲慘重，僅見巋然獨存之各工廠烟突而已。京都一彈未落，大阪爲工業區，則已全部破壞。大致東京至橫濱被破壞百分之六十五；大阪被破壞百分之七十，廣島則提失百分之一百矣。　　至日本之物價，可以二點言之：（一）發行額——戰前日幣之發行額爲二十億圖，戰事結束時爲三百六十億圓，現爲一千另六十億元。故物價與戰前相較，以發行額覘之，當爲一與五百之比。（二）一般物價——爲一百與二萬五千之比，高漲二百五十倍。米較戰前漲二百五十倍至二百七十倍，每擔價格，黑市為八千日圓，官價為五百五十圓。然日本之配給制度相當成功，戰時每一日人，每日給米二合三勺（一合等於三分之二磅），現增至二合半，勉可果腹。戰前日本全國食糧，向恃韓台供給，現每年可產五千五百萬至七千萬石（全國人口七千萬，每人每年可得米一石），惟政府旣以五百五十圓之官價收購，農民無利可圖，故皆藏米不售，黑市因之產生，成爲一嚴重問題。日人佐膳之物，本以魚類佔其大宗，近因漁船缺乏，產量亦少，但如能出高價，餐館中仍有供給，陽奉陰違，到處皆然，官方檢查殊不甚嚴格也。　　至於住的問題，此次戰爭中，日本全國之房屋毀於砲火者共一百萬幢，現已修復二十萬幢，即全數五分之一。現最成問題者，爲國外日僑日俘之復員者達六百萬人（尙有一百萬人未遣返），彼等回國之後，輒感無屋可住，而每家草蓆上鱗比而眠，亦已與沙丁魚無殊矣。　至日人之衣服，戰時最顯著之現象爲喜穿長袴，諒以長袴較暖，可以稍節衣料。惟近以迎合盟軍心理之故，日本婦女之服飾遂有復古之觀，羣以競衣和服爲事，腰帶上更多以蝴蝶爲飾者，殆以盟軍皆知「蝴蝶夫人」故事也。至復員軍人，則多仍衣軍服如故，戴軍帽者更到處可見，想亦以衣料缺乏，補充困難，不得不然，惟我人視之，則未嘗不以其刺目而心厭之也。　日本原爲產紗之國，紡錠有三百萬枚之多，一旦能獲原料，即可大量生產，年產量每人平均可得紗布二十尺，而我國以目前而論，每人仍祇能得布八尺。麥帥現正鼓勵其棉布之增產，將用以易取國外之食糧。　　日本最嚴重之問題爲「行」。過去日人以頗守秩序著稱，而今日則競搭電車，爭先恐後，已毫無秩序可言。日本現有官私鐵道共二五·五〇〇公里（內官有者一，五·五〇〇公里），乘坐者極多，家在數百里外之學生，有每日乘火車到校者，故全國人口祇七千萬，而火車乘客則每月有二億七千萬之多。車皮共一一八·〇〇〇輛，現因煤斤缺乏，一部份停頓，使用之取皮共八〇·〇〇〇輛，每節車本限乘坐五十餘人，而今則擁擠已極，有多至每節日。百人者。某次北海道有沙門魚七千噸，運往本州，不意火車運輸一千五百噸後，其餘竟皆以單帮之力，於一個月左右，悉數運完，每人有携魚至四五十磅者，火車因此輩單帮客之活躍，益形擁擠，秩序益亂，老弱被擠致死者，日有所聞。　　汽車亦極缺乏，除美軍用車外，僅數量甚微之木炭汽車。出差汽車價格尤貴，極短一段路程，索價輒五六十圓。依照最近發表之匯率，五十圓即等於美金一元，車資之高昂若是，故多數日人己習於安步常車矣。</p>

宇熲，於本月三日下午五時，突提其友張淸蔭電話，僞稱安樂棉毛紡織公司經理鄧仲元之子被綁，邀其同赴聖約翰大學附近與綁匪接洽取贖，王受騙前往，張更誘其入兆豐公園，趁夜深人靜黑暗中，乘其不備，突自王背後，將其抱住，拔刀猛戳，並奪其公事手槍，發射一彈，中王腿部。張淸蔭見事已成，即匆匆逃逸，王倉卒遇暴，一時不知所措，迨張逸後神志較淸，掙扎步出花園呼救，警備部聞報，立即出動兜捕，在長寗路將兇手張淸蔭拘獲，並抄獲兇器，該案已於昨日移解地檢處。據張淸蔭在警備部供稱：謀害王宇穎動機，係安樂廠廠長王德民唆使，因王宇熲擬向王德民敲詐黃金二十條，於二月二十七日下午九時至十時，在王德民處計劃將王宇熲除去，允事成後酬其黃金十條。但王德民矢口否認其事，謂廿七日晚係與同業馮蔚如在新華酒家三樓晚餐，餐後又同去會樂里，絕無唆使殺人之事，究竟謀害王宇熲之原因何在，地檢處將嚴密偵查，務使其水落石出。姚慕蓮辭職照準　李開第補任議員　　市參議員姚慕蓮，前函請參議會準予辭職，該會轉呈內政部請准予辭職，並另依法由候補參議員遞補，現業經內政部電准辭職，遺缺並已依法由候補參議員李一開第遞補。在美訂購新車　十二輛將續運到　　〔本報訊〕兩路局前在美國訂購之車廂二十四輛，除已運到之十二輛正在裝修，即可加入京滬路行駛外，所餘十二輛正在運華途中，不日即可到滬。據悉，該二十四輛，在美原價爲一萬美元，因係舊貨，售與我國時减爲八千元。兩路局招待遊杭　記者團昨晩返滬　　〔本報訊〕京滬滬杭甬兩路鐵路管理局此次邀本市各報記者去杭遊春，一行二十二人，於廿日晨出發，抵杭後，除參觀錢江大橋，之江大學，及遊覽各處名勝外，並曾往省府及市府訪晤沈主席周市長等。沈主席適去京出席三中全會，故由雷秘書長代爲接見，並於二十二日中午假外賓招待所歡宴。一行己於昨晚返滬。協助赴美採訪　美對外報道連絡處　為我記者服務　　〔美國新聞處訊〕目下奉派駐在美國或準備前往美國之中國新聞記者，可向紐約市之國務院對外報道連絡處取得協助，以便採訪美國各地之新聞。對外報道連絡處對於一切正式委派之外籍記者。編輯，攝影記者及無錢電評論家等，均爲之服務。該連絡處並非企圖答覆新聞記者之一切詢問，僅代爲設法出具介紹函，藉以採訪情報，並造謁專家與要人。該連絡處計劃各種旅行指南，並代爲設法享用各圖書館與研究之設備。對外報導連絡處並不閱讀外籍記者所寫之新聞稿，亦不施行檢查，對於傳達海外之電訊，亦並不關心。其唯一目標爲指導外籍記者往何處採訪新聞，或會晤何人，以取得準確而詳細之情報。　對外報導連絡處之地址爲紐約市西五十七號街二百五十號門牌第八百廿八號房間，準備遣派通訊員前往美國之出版機關，可向本市美國新聞處接洽，可省去不少時間與精力，而由美國新聞處先去函對外報導連絡處，概述該通訊員所欲採訪消息之應圍，或開列所欲訪晤之人物名單。蘇萬雷在菲犯綁案　國籍查明解地檢處　　〔本報訊〕菲建賓華僑蘇萬雷，曾於去年十二月七日在馬尼刺勾結當地匪類那架僑領李孝錦之子李安泰，案發後，蘇逃回上海，經國民黨駐馬尼刺總支部常務委員施逸生電報淞滬警備司令部，於三月十二日下午一時將該蘇萬雷緝獲。日前我駐菲公使陳質平又應事主李孝錦之請，電宣司令鐵吾，謂蘇有中菲二重國籍，恐菲當局將申請引渡，但菲境情形特殊，該犯以在祖國審辦爲宜，若必要時，李孝錦可檢同證件來滬作證等語，經警備司令部查明該犯父母皆係國人，最近來滬亦領有回國證書，故於昨日速同全部案卷解地檢處依法偵查。翁媳通姦夫案　董顧氏判刑五年　　〔本報訊〕翁媳通姦殺夫案主角董顧氏，昨在高院判處有期徒刑五年。按宣順元，有子　　　，童養媳顧氏，董順元與氏有通姦情事。三十三年夏，董錫桃突遭殺害，該案原經僞地院以殺人罪處董順元及董顧氏無期徒刑，董順元旋　斃獄中，茲經高院　審後，以敎唆殺人罪改判董顧氏徒刑五年。行總船　員竊油案　地檢處提起公訴　　〔本報訊〕行總水運大隊萬儉輪英籍機長亞瑟利夫，於去年十二月廿一日夜間，串同船上西崽張文高，注油夫頭目李阿來，火夫姚行富。胡春富。將輪上油池一打開竊取柴油數十噸，售得黃金二十兩，法幣四百萬元。案發，除張李二犯在逃外，餘均被拘。該案經地檢處偵查終結，認被吿等五人實有刑法第二十八條，懲治貪汚條例第三條第二款罪螊，業已提起公訴。華豐毛羢廠　竊貨案破獲　牛糞堆裏　吊出贓物　　〔本報訊〕滬東黃興路新建華豐毛絨廠，廠房尙未落　，內部正在佈置　詎于十七日午夜　發生巨竊案，被竊白鐵管十八根，業由新市街分警局長倪化南，飭司法股長宋劍虹，率屬窮四書夜之力，偵得該項鐵管二根，業已被竊賊售出，餘藏黃興路東曠地牛糞堆內，竊犯多名則匿居于齊齊哈爾路蔣家浜附近棚戶內。彼等行動早出晩歸。　　極為詭秘　　。當於廿一日晩八時半，先派便衣幹警一批，化裝馳往藏匿鐵管處守候，復于十夜十二時許，由宋股長親率巡官鄭竟成，幹警王志剛，呂文選，王炳元等前往蔣家浜一帶棚戶搜查。見有許其剛者（廿九歲，阜寗人，業三輪車夫，住蔣家浜申新工房）返來。　　形色倉皇　　輕員警將其拘獲嚴究，據共該鐵管兩根業已於當日上午十一時，售與許昌路昆明路口同昌祥舖中，舖主名姚德發。乃將收　犯姚德發先行捕獲，另留一部份員警，守候于許其剛貼隣同黨吳小昆家　　以觀動靜　　。許姚二犯經帶局嚴　後，又供出羽黨老裁縫戴依淸。甚子戴德選及張連生等犯。乃押同許犯按址一一指捕，並在吳小昆家拘獲小江山者一名，迄至午夜二時半，所有竊犯全部落網，十六根鐵管贓物，亦被吊出，聞該項贓物，估計値價四千餘萬元、本市簡訊　　中興銀行董事黃漢樑擾亂金融案，不起訴處分後，昨午後黃之家屬至地檢處領取前被扣押之帳冊等物件。　　本月廿九日為革命先烈紀念日，上海市政府，市黨部，靑年團上海支團部，昨日下午召集各有關機關團體，會商籌備紀念辦法。　　郵局第二批自備信箱即日起在該管理局及各支局發答，每具售價二萬二千元元　　本年第一次稅務人員考試，上海區已開始報名，本月底截止。往江海關三樓該實辦事處報名者頗踴躍。應考人體格撿查，係委託山東路仁濟醫院辦理。又第二次考試報各定四月二十日起至六月十日止。　　本市防癆聯合委員會定華山路三七一號爲會址，已開始辦公。附設之肺病中心診療所亦將於本月廿四日開幕。又該會江灣澄裏肺病療養院（在葉家花園內）四月內即可收容病人。氣象預測　　西比利亞反氣旋中心在華中，延及我國·朝鮮·東　·日本建部·琉球及南海北部。　　天氣預測：黃海：睛較暖霾，中度西風至北風，中浪至微浪。華中：　，局部陰，晨霧，中度西風至不定向風。上海：晴，較暖至時曇，晨夕輕霾或霧，中度不定向風。東海：曇，南部陰雨，淸勁北囤，中浪，台灣四局巨浪。昨日溫度：最高五十六度六，最低三十六度二。來函　　貴報本日刊載關於統一承租問題之談話新開一則查與原憲頗有出入按鄙人談話之內客實爲「前行政院分配上海各機關房屋委員會分配與各機關之房屋其由中央信託局統一承租之期限屆滿市府自無强迫業主續討租約之理然各受記房屋之住戶待統一承租期滿後如一律不能續訂租約勢必引起數千戶公務人員之嚴重居住問題處此情形設欲擬訂兩全辦法極爲困難若能想出顧全雙方權益之解決途徑則屬個人最大期望因比市府正請示於行政院必要時並擬呈請派員赴京向行政院報告此間情形藉供參攷」再前述分配房屋全部係前行政院分配上海各機關房屋委員會議定分配並非市府辦理原文載稱大半由市府支配一節與事實不符用特倂謂刊登更正爲荷歐陽　詮敬啓三月廿一日輪船業緊急會議　籲請調整運價　解救當前危機　　本市輪船業公會理事長杜月笙，由港回滬後，特於昨日召開理監事緊急聯席會議，檢討解決航業當前危機之急要措施。出席理監事錢新之·徐學禹·楊管北·陸英耕·魏文翰等二十餘人。首由杜理事長報告華南航業情形，並指示航業界，改進業務便利交通之重要方針，旋即討論調整貨客運價問題，各理畫以現在運價尚係上年三月一日核定之價目，年餘未經調整，而航運成本確已激增十倍之多。例如政府配售之煤炭，已由每噸二萬四千元漲至十八萬元，黑市已達六七十萬元，柴油已由每噸七萬二千元漲至五十萬元，以上年三月之運價應付目前飛騰之物價，實　難以維持。　　現航空運價已增加百分之一百五十，永運與空運情形相同，民營又占多數，當經一般議決，仍請政府准予調整貨客運價，以免各路航輪因無款支付應購燃料等款，而减航甚至停航。在未調整運價以前，早將貼補款撥至，至政府採取調整運價，使航運自給，或抑制運價，貼補虧損政策，枉航業界均無成見，惟恐國庫支細，杯水車薪，無濟於事，徒有貼補之名，仍不足以維持，故懇切要求迅准調整運價。嗣討論輪船用煤及輪船業協助煤運等問題，僉以經濟部燃料管理委員會向租外輪運煤，每噸運價合法幣七萬至八萬元，而對於本國輪船承運，僅給二萬七千五百元，與維護本國航運之宗旨背道而馳，使本國航輪無法維持成本，航業界除向政府呼籲外，如不即爲合理之調整，各輪勢將不能繼續擔任煤運。杜理事長允將此種苦衷向政府陳述，但勸告各航商仍繼續用全力協助煤運，以解決當前之煤荒問題。改善交通壅塞　考慮治標辦法　限制三輪車人力車分區營業　　〔本報訊〕市區交通之改善問題，現正由最近來華之美籍專家康威會同有關各方面商討研究中，昨日警察局交通科科長陸佻曾訪康威，對本問題作詳細之討論。陸氏指出本市交通阻塞之現象，非交通警察獨力所能改善，必須各方通力合作，克服困難因素，並有充足之經費，始克有效。警察局交通科曾詳細研討目前交通阻塞之原因有下列數端：（一）車輛數額增加，非機動車輛太多。根據去年底統計，各種車輛包括機動車。電車·馬車·自由車車·人力車·三輪車·汽胎輪貨車·鐵輪貨車·小車·三輪送貨車等，總數爲二十二萬九千餘輛，較之民國二十八年之九萬五千餘輛增加一倍半左右。　　原因種種不一　　（二）警力不敷分配。（三）路面與人行道太狹·（四）車輛速率不一。（五）停車塲缺乏。中區每日進出汽車約有一萬輛左右，但目前停車塲僅能容納四千餘輛，其餘勢必停靠於路邊。（六）駕駛人不明交通規則。（七）缺乏交通標誌。（八）法定罰金太低。（九）攤販太多。（十）市民不遵守交通規則。（十一）事權不統一，常有相互牽制之弊。上述各點中尤以車輛增多，路面太狹，攤販太多，市民不遵守規則及事權不統一諸原因最爲重要。當局雖曾擬其治標治本辦法，但或因困於經費，或因影響小民生計，迄今尙未能具體實現。　　尚待縝密研究　　現為急求治標之計，或將考慮限制三輪車，人力車分區營業。按估計現時每日進出中區之三輪車，人力車約共三萬五千輛，如採取分區制度，類似前租界時代，法租界照會與公共租界照會劃分之情形，限制在中區營業之三輪車人力車，不得超過一萬五千輛，其餘車輛規定於他處營業，如此則中區交通擁塞情形或可大爲改善。此項建議，交通科長陸俠昨已提供與康威，是否可以實行，尙待縝密研究。又市政當局計劃在林森路裝置機動紅綠燈以節省警力，短期內將可試辦。社會服務讀者諮詢　法律質疑　　（一）自由婚姻　　洪淸問（一）　沒有血統關係·但因親戚聯姻，繁族中往有輩分不同之事，問與民法「九八三」條第二款旁系親族輩分、不同者不得締婚是否有抵觸？可否締婚？（二）男女已屆法定年歲，可否不顧家長反對，自由結婚？（三）女方之兄對其妹之婚事表示反對，在法律能否產生效果？　　〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）旁系姻親如在五親等之外，依民法第九百八十三條第一項第二款所書，不受限制，雖輩分不同，亦可結婚。（二）如男女雙方皆已滿二十歲，則結婚不必得家長之同意，但應有公開之儀式，及二人以上之證人。（三）女兄旣非家長，雖表示反對，該婚姻在法律上仍屬有効。　　（二）惡意誹謗　　楊萊生問　甲男乙女結合後，育有子女各一，後因意見不合，請律師證明協議離婚。子女歸乙方撫養，甲方祖遺田地房產均歸子女所有，另給乙女贍養費若干，仳離後一年，甲方另娶丙女，已近五年、最近乙方以破壞甲丙名譽爲要挾，向甲索取鉅款，請問（一）乙如至甲辦公處謾駡或携子女至甲丙家中坐索不走，在法律上如何處置？（二）乙之子女旣得有甲方祖遺房地產之全部往後有無權利繼承甲之遭產？（四）書面謾駡（如寫信謾駡甲丙）是否構成毀謗罪？　　〔傅况麟律師答〕（一）如有妨害名譽或妨害自由行爲，可依法訴究。（二）子女所得之房地產僅屬贈與性質，將來對於甲之遺產，仍有繼承權。（三）如乙僅直接寫信謾駡甲丙，幷非散布於衆，不能構成誹謗罪。

<p>中央銀行決定　撤銷外匯審核處　全國通匯地點劃分為七區　　〔本報訊〕據悉：中央銀行外匯審核處即將裁撤。今後外匯審核業務，將分由央行業務局，及輸入管理會秘書處負責辦理。央行業務局將審核指定銀行之外匯買賣業務，而輸管會秘書處則負責一般商人申請之審核。即輸管會接受事前申請之審核，中央銀行業務局負支付之審核。至外匯審核處原有審核附表三輸入品之業務，與輸管會秘書處原有審核附表一輸入品之業務，或將另由其他部門經辦。外匯審核處處畏林維英，將調任輸管會秘書處處長，惟聞林氏辭意甚堅。　　〔又訊〕中央銀行通匯地點，刻已重新劃定，全國分為華東華中華南華西華北西北東北　七區，計二十九省，六十四縣市，按（一）華東區，江蘇為南京鎭江揚州新浦徐州淮陰等六縣市，浙江為杭州溫州甯波等三縣市，安徽為合肥蕪湖蚌埠等三縣，江西為南昌九江吉安贛縣等四縣市。（二）華中區，湖北為漢口宜昌兩市，湖南為長沙衝陽常德沅院湘深等五縣市，河南為開封洛陽鄭州等三縣，陝西為西安寳鷄南鄭等三縣市。（三）華南區，廣東為廣州韶關汕頭湛江海口市等五縣市，廣西為柳州桂林梧州南甯等四縣市，福建為厦門福州泉州等三縣市。（四）華西區，四川為重慶成都自流井萬縣樂山三合等六縣市，貴州為貴陽市，雲南為昆明下關，西康為康定雅安。（五）華北區，河北為天津北平山海關，山西為太原，山東為靑烏濟南，熱河為承德，察哈爾為張家口。（六）西北區，甘肅為蘭州天水醴泉等三縣市，綏遠為歸綏，甯夏為甯夏，靑海為西甯，新疆為迪化哈密。（七）東北區，吉林為長春永吉，潦甯為瀋陽錦州，松江為哈爾演，遼北為四平。賣方氣焰大盛　華股市價下瀉　　華股昨人心更見脆弱，大勢已去，賣方氣燄萬丈。臨收前十分鐘，散空有補，尚見堅定。孰料五分鐘內，一瀉一百五十元，而以低價結束。無稽謠言，若取消遞交等說，竟能成為空方削價之工具，可見人心對股市漸失信仰矣。晨開　　晨開　　以征收現金保證及借款成功等說之不可靠，現交見疲，遞交上塲空方有補一而尚穩，開後一九八號一三三號一〇二號二二四號一四號均進，遞永紗即升至二四二〇元。八五號三二號雖賣，一八五號一〇二號一一七號七五號二二四號八三號二八號一一二號俱進，遞永紗升至二四五〇元。現永紗亦見二四〇〇元。一四一號三二號四號一五六號二一九號九七號一四一號八九號八四號紛舊而跌至二三〇〇元。二二三號二二號雖進，一九七號八九號亦出而後進，尚呈盤旋。一九二號二一八號一一七號六〇號賣出而降為二二七〇元。七六號二〇號趁低吸納而轉定。一四號一五二號三二號四號一八三號三六號一五四號一五五號一五六號一七號二〇七號俱有吸納，在數度掙扎下，逐漸拉高。近午空方若一九八號一五二號等都有補進而回升至二四二〇元。一一號一九七號二一五號二二三號一九二號七一號七八號一五四號紛紛供給，為數雖少，但以為時僅餘五分鐘，浮多急斬，謠傳停做遞交等說，頓乏維持，下瀉一百五十元，而以低價結束。惟各小型股在增資紛紜之際，尚見穩定。結果較前收計永紗（最後成交價二二九〇元牌價二二三〇元買二二五〇元賣）信和新華微降，美亞跌半成弱，中法降一成，華豐微升，景福勤興升半成左右，新光漲半成强。遞交計永紗跌半成，美亞降半成不到，信和微挫，華豐新光微升，冷股統益水泥漲半成，餘者升降俱微，塲外各股亦均見低。統債突跌　　公債，昨金融帮獲利了結，市况不支。少許業中人倡言對敲交易，一時尚不易普遍。統丙晨開一三〇〇〇元，自一三三〇〇元起逐步下降，惟在一二〇〇〇元左右，稍有掙扎，終以環境不利，降至一〇五〇〇元以下結束。結果較前收計甲乙丁戊各跌一千八九百元，統丙慘降三千五。成交約一千餘萬元。謠傳中籤各票將予廢止，致人心不振，賣風掀起。外股平疲　　外股昨在證券幫出籠下，仍難振作。洋商仍吸怡啤紙業。恒紗晨開降至一五五〇〇元，自一五四〇〇元起，回升至一六一〇〇元，而後以盤局結束。結果較前收計紙業怡啤平平，餘者均告微降。以集體力量推廣輸出　出口商提議聯營　　〔本報訊〕央行昨對委託銷售出口貨，議決新辦法後，本市某進出口業人士，認為貨物限期出售，勢必遭到殺價之危險。且自我國調整外匯率後，我國貨物在世界各國市塲價格，業已一再貶跌。今如再限期出售，結果更將助長頹勢。此中尤以業已落令之貨物如皮毛等，益將遭逢殺價危機。所幸我國大宗出口貨，如桐油猪鬃之類，都非委託銷售性質。而委託銷售之貨物，大致以冷門貨較多，如古董刺繡等。　　據渠觀察：目前出口物資中，國營事業約佔百分之七十四，民營約佔百分之二十六。此緣資委會之礦砂如鋦銻等，中信局之大豆，中植油廠之桐油等，已佔出口物資中之大宗，有以致之。故渠之意見，擬聯合經營小規模物資（如地毯，手工藝品，農產品等）之出口商，共組輸出業聯營公司。各參加之出口廠商，可以實物抵充股本。俾以集體力量，作有計劃之輸出推廣。一面將計劃融通各廠商之資金，同時將發揮集團行動，避免個別競爭，而遭國外廠商殺價之危險云。米糧趨勢穩定　油市去胃旺盛　　昨南北市到米共計一萬石左右，北粳形勢定局，南粳提高殺次，中下早稻略呈軟化。白元亦然，高平次呆，陰元暫無變化。秞米亦然平定，趨勢穩定之態。　麵粉隨到隨銷，亦少變動。麩皮鄉銷轉活，浙方略有問津，挺昂千元。雜糧則大多回漲。　　黃豆油廠進胃甚股，轉口納胃亦貪，太街相繼收吸，冉冉上升，續漲二三千元。菉豆仍居疲境，赤豆廣方略動，價無軒輛。缸豆汕頭搜購，物稀為貴，蠶豆到銷兩平，市勢堅定。紅糧萎靡不振，苞米酒精廠動辦，疲而轉挺，回漲二三千元。生仁洋莊消化蟬聯，節節上漲，高峯層出，步升三五千元。芝蔴洋莊亦仍活跳，依然挺秀俏俐。　　油市華南納胃較旺，貨主甚堅，直綫上漲。生豆油續跳七八千元，淸油再高八九千元。蔴油亦堅一二千元，豆餅汕厦台灣互相競購，買氣甚盛，猛漲千餘元。昨各式內銷茶過程均與隔日相仿，良以去化動而不堅，致人心非常甯靜。至於洋莊茶市，一般受銀根束縛之貨主，在　吐多時下，昨仍相率吐出，而買戶胃納雖佳，惟對於售價前途，依然看跌，因此咸抱觀望宗皆，收市結果，成交數量殊為荏弱，市勢則賡續處於衰軟氣氛中，行情亦迂迴見疲。羊毛交易轉熱　羽毛冷落不堪　　〔本報訊〕滯疲甚　之羊毛交易，日來轉趨繁盛，產區旣源源而來，行商更吸胃頻仍，出口勉可圖利，內銷亦屬不惡。蓋因漢洲羊毛限制進口，部份羊毛仍可供紡製毛條，湖州羊毛，春毛產期已屆，今後來貨似可增多。昨市山東羊毛收價每司馬擔為十三萬元，湖州羊毛價亦相彷。羽毛市况仍戰，內復已頻外價限度，行商進間轉軟。鵝毛喊價每司馬擔四十八萬元，鴨毛卅五萬元，無甚成交。紗市挺秀　　昨日紗市轉趨挺秀，因紡管會對各廠念支紗收購價，已正式提高至三百十五萬，人心因是欣欣向榮，引起業中買胃，故自開盤後，各支價格逐漸上翔，迄收市時，約較前日好起五萬至十萬之譜。在美委託銷售貨物　限兩個月內出售　所得外匯結售中央銀行　　〔本報訊〕中央銀行副總裁劉攻芸，於昨日上午十一時許，召集本市出口商馬仲達等多人，舉行談話會。中國銀行陳長桐，交通銀行李道南等，亦列席參加。席間央行表示：對各出口商在外匯率調整為一萬二千元以前，業已到達美國之委託銷售貨物，自明日起，應於二個月內，予以出售。並將所得外匯，結售予央行。如二個月無法出售，則由世界貿易公司代為無限價出售。繼即由各出口商分陳意見，有主張如二個月內不能出售，由各出口商將原貨物設法運回。討論經過，終以值茲撙節外匯資源時期，如果將原物遝回，坐耗鉅額運費外匯，反不如在美出售為佳。故央行所提意見，終獲各出口商同意。該項辦法，一俟呈准張總裁後，即付施行。　　又據悉：央行前為委託銷售貨物之出售，早有第十二號通函，分發各指定銀行，規定該項貨物，應於三個月內出售，並將所得外匯，結售各指定銀行。惟各指定銀行及出口商，迄未照辦，致各項委託銷售之貨物，多滯積未售。故此次特催速出售，以增國家外匯資源。糖價堅定　　昨糖市趨勢仍穩，其間微有軒輊。公會劃盤，現二二中砂白二十二萬七千元，次之二十一萬五千元。二四粗白又升五千元，四半車白升八千元，三半車白升三四千元。秘魯細砂二十一萬二千元至二十萬零八千元。合赤十五萬一二千元，微挫一二千元。餘如十，十一，期棧單均續緊。號貨開出提靑十三萬三千元，升二三千元。順德靑十二萬九千元，刁靑十二萬三四千元，計共三百包之譜。第十一期台糖　配價並未更動　　台糖公司近由台東號輪首次裝到新出精白細砂一千噸抵埠，其甜性濃度達九九·五，且極勻細，堪與秘魯糖媲美，即將普遍應市銷售。至台省製就之方糖三千箱，下週亦可到滬。昨晨該公司發表第十一期配糖數量，計一號綿白一萬四千一百廿五包，特號砂白八千一百四十五包，特號綿白五千六百九十五包，冰糖九百包，共計二萬八千八百六十五包。其配價並未更動。一號綿白每市担仍售十七萬元，特號砂白十九萬元，特號綿白二十萬元，冰糖卅萬元。至於零售商要求社局將手續費加增一節，則與該公司無涉。又悉該公司配價依照市府評議會所決定，輕易不加調整云央行二批檢查行莊　財部另派新人參加　　中央銀行為配合經濟緊急揹施方案，對各行莊之復查，第一批四十四家，業已結束，不日將由財政部公佈檢查結果，對犯金潮案之行莊將予嚴處，第二批行莊檢查，該行已奉令於昨日開始，檢查人員仍以財政部為主體，由該行輔助之。財部第一批派來滬之十七位檢查員，不再派來，另派一批新人來滬檢查，如此可避免因面熟而請私情之事發生。此次檢查方式，亦仍採用抽查方式，共有一百八十家左右行莊，在準備抽查，近日在搜集各方面之錢索，俟財政部所派之人員全部到齊後，即正式擴大檢查云。未開業七行莊代表　向市參議會請願　臚陳理由請另訂妥善辦法　　〔本報訊〕本市豫康銀行上海分行。宏昶錢莊·鴻康興記錢莊。富源錢莊。福泰源記錢莊。重慶泰豐銀行上海分行。和平銀行上海分行等七行莊，以奉財政部訓令，為配合經濟緊急措施方案，對於商業金融機關嚴予整飭，所有上海市經核准復業之銀行錢莊，及增設之分支行處，迄至二月二十六日止，尚未開業者，其核准原案，應即予撤銷等因。該行莊等於昨日上午，特派代表康來文等四人，前赴市參議會請願。當由項秘書長昌櫂接見，該代表等臚陳理由為：（一）該行莊等或為戰後申請復業，或為內地銀行在上海設立分行，均依法呈請復業，今一旦中止撤銷，遂令正當商人陷於進退維谷之境。（二）行莊之業務，受財部嚴密監督，金潮案實與行莊無關。（三）突然中止開業，損失頗大。（四）政府此項措施有損法治精神。（五）開業與開幕不能混為一談。各行莊大都已經開業，惟未行開慕儀式而已。旋由該代表等留呈請願書一件，懇予速轉中央，另訂妥善辦法，俾能繼續營業。蠶絲調查團　分組往產地調查　　為明瞭江浙製絲工塲設備實際情形，以作本年度蠶絲事業上之參攷起見，前昨兩日由農經兩部及蘇浙省府在滬代表，會同中國農民銀行中國蠶絲公司各負責人，召開會議，研討調查表册及應行注意事項，並由以上機構選派技術員組織調查團，進行調查工作。計分四組，每組四人，以中央機關每組各佔一人，即農經兩部各二人，中農中蠶各四人，其餘則為地方政府，每省各派二人，定下週二三出發，分別前往杭州嘉興長安　縣及蘇州無錫常州等地實地調查。其範圍先以去年開業之工廠為限，預計兩週後完成，然後擬具意見書，開會審核，以便實施云。絲市疲中帶穩　　昨日生絲市况疲中帶穩，印商洋行雖有吸意，奈以英鎊新匯率影響，開價仍低，執戶多不肯輕易出售，故無成交。昨晨開市，Ｃ級男分廿二條紋用戶絲成交十五担，每担價七百十五萬元，與前日收盤同，ＤＥ各級，均無交易，川灰絲及雜牌另担，猶無人問津。輯里喊價高，亦無交易。杭州綢廠客人，已有到滬，用戶一絲漸見生動，法商洋得對細條紋一生絲，有扒吸意，惟無貨供應。桐油期貨　做開甚多　　〔本報訊〕昨市桐油期貨，做開甚多。足度白油，二星期以後交貨，價為卅五萬五千元，現貨每担連桶四十四萬元，門銷四十二萬元。頂西洪吉盈豐仍無到貨，副西洪續有到埠，每桶八三市斤便為三十六七萬元。漢口前市做開每担卅六萬五千元，重慶廿六萬五千元，杭州報價卅五萬元。出口情形，紐約價每磅三角六分半（散裝油），倫敦每噸二百廿英磅。據悉：桐油到貨雖多一時不致出口。紹酒到源稀落　價格齊步上昇　　〔本報訊〕日來紹酒到源稀少，市銷不弱，價格猛昇。遠年酒每罎六五市斤為卅二萬元，普通千陳五〇市斤價為十八萬元，平均較上週漲起二成左右。抗戰以還，紹酒

<p>魯南風雲　（一）踏上臨沂門檻  十日臨沂快訊　本報特派記者凌松壽　　魯南是一塊苦地方，不論從任何一個角度來看，她絕對比不上江南魚米之鄉，在抗戰中，她的貢獻却最雄偉，同時，在目前戰亂中，受的苦又是最深刻。　　一月間，共軍以臨沂為根據地，集合了四十萬以上的兵力向徐州猛犯，企岡截斷隴海綫，對蘇北作捲土重來之舉。然而這一個暴徒式的襲擊，遭遇到國軍空前的打擊，不到兩個星期，瘋在的攻勢，完全瓦解。相反地，代之而起的便是以國軍為主動的魯南戰事。取郯城，克臨沂，收嶧縣，復棗莊……顰鼓聲中，前方不斷地傳來了捷報。　　在共軍控制下，作為他們華中軍敵要地的魯南，究竟是一個什麼樣子的地方？　　記者因為事前不知道徐州到新安鎭的來往車輛很多，所以在鎭江特向八十三師（現駐防臨沂部隊）留守處常高參詢問關於赴臨沂的車輛，常高參告訴我，二日有師部車車一列由徐州開赴運河站（束距新安鎭九十華里），到了運河站後，車輛開赴山東的很多，根本就不成問題了。我當時聽了，以為交通工具已告解決，非常高興。到了徐州之後，什麽事都不管，先找着了師部專車住下來。道一列車是四等車廂和一些貨車拚凑起來的，大部份裝着輜重和馬匹。晚間八時開車，記者躺在打開的行李上，被機器聲攪得澈夜未能入睡。　　天明由朦朧中醒來，火車已經停住，出車一望，荒漠異常，問問人家，才知道因為前面的路軌被共軍破壞了，不能繼續開駛到運河站，這裏是碾莊，距離目的地還有三十華里。　　距離鐵道的左邊約一里路左右，有一堆民房，記者跑去和他們談了一下，知道了這裏的情况並不怎樣安定，也沒有部隊的駐守，有的時候，可以聽到零星的槍聲。據他們說，每天由徐州到新安鎭的汽車很多，軍車也有，商車也有，不過經過這兒時，通常不停車。我聽了，懊悔和頹喪交集，經與同來的八十三師汽車連王明生連長和軍需處余光輝課長商議之下決定如有便車能到新安鎭最好，否則乘原來的火車返徐，到明天再講。在公路上守候了足有兩個小時，才看到一輛汽車向徐州方面開駛，為求早一點休息起見，大家同意乘汽車回徐州。乃舉手招呼停車，可是他並沒有理會我們，風馳電掣般地從我們面前擦過，看着他走，毫無辦法，一速七八輛，都是這樣。王連長氣得說：「我這個汽車速連長，今天反要觸汽車的霉頭了」　　無蓬的卡車　　好容易攔住了一輛商車，大家像在水中獲得了救生圈一樣，爭先恐後地爬上去。一個多小時後，過了大許集，距徐州還有五十餘華里，汽車的機油用光了，車子仍舊勉强地朝前開，但是大家都担心牠會中途拋錨，那豈不糟糕？幸好，一會兒我們碰到一輛山徐州開往新安鎭的商車，車子上確實再也裝不了人，經與車主多方情商，總算答應我們在車子上插下了足。——在這兒，插足眞是一個再適當沒有的形容詞。人擠滿了我看到有幾位軍人間還有點兒空隙，乃說了好多的好話，因為他們是七十四師五十一旅的士兵，我又抬出大帽子告訴他們我和貴師張師長，貴旅陳旅長都是好朋友，他們才客氣地讓我站下。車子上的人，看見我們道樣地忽來忽去，感覺到莫明其妙　　現在是農曆二月，江南早該是草長鶯飛的時節了，可是在此間原野中，依舊看不出一點春之消息。黃漠漠的一片土地中，絕找不着一點那帶着生氣的綠色。我站在車子上，路旁楊柳的枯枝，不時掠拂着我的頭部，這裏我們可以體會到：祗要冬天的嚴寒捱過去，春天的溫暖，遲早總是要降臨的。你不看見車子上很多還鄉的同胞嗎？他們冒着風塵，掮了行李，正在想着回家後應當怎樣整理出一個溫暖的家庭！　　北方本來灰塵多，何况我是站在沒有蓬子的卡車上？有位老鄉看到我臉上的灰塵，太不像樣了，勸我抹一下，抹過後，他再看看我，才笑着說：「這才像人樣兒！」大家一聽，都笑起來了。　到了運河站附近，就有不少被共軍燒燬的機車和車廂的殘骸，七歪八倒地躺在那兒。鐵道更不必說，不但枕木燒去，鐵軌埋到地下，拋到河中，並且連路基都給他掘得零零落落；鐵路間的橋樑，也都破壞不堪。容許我們帶一點幽默的氣氛來講話，那麽，我們得承認「扒路」的確是有本領的。就以記者所看到的這一段隴海路來說（從碾莊站到新安鎭長凡一百廿華里），不但要一個相當長的時問來從事破壞，並且也需要一筆大的本錢來幹。然而，在今日民家財盡的中國，竟還這樣忍心破壞嗎？　　到新安鎭，已是日落西山。正準備停車卸客時，車子不慎將左面的兩個輪子滑到路旁的溝中去。車路與地面成了四十五度的斜度。幸虧我是站在右面而且人很多，所以沒有倒下，但却也飽受虛驚，想不到在吃飽了灰塵，站酸了兩腿之後，還要這樣地來一下。　　運氣總算沒有壞到極端，我們得到八十三師有五輛車子明最開赴臨沂的消息。不過當我們才費了無限的口舌把睡的地方找好時，問題又來了；這兒部隊的後方機構很多，而汽車有汽車的任務，決不能裝運太多的友軍，為了避免麻煩，車子特預先開往鎭的北端，明天天一亮好能秘密地開出。於是我們又要搬了，幸承村中某位老鄉之情，讓出一個房間記者和王連長，韋軍需三個人草草地睡了一夜。　　新郯公路上　　新安鎭是隴海路上一個重要的鎭市，北距山東境界不過十餘華里，魯南蘇北物資的交流，差不多都以這裏為集中地點。聽說在國軍初進駐時，人影子都沒有一個，現在却漸漸地繁榮起來了。　第二天早長，四時卅分就起身，在寒風頻拂下的車廂中等到天明，車子才向北方開出。　　九時許，抵郯城停車而進早點，二百元一根的油條、，要比上海賣的長兩倍。土產物品相當便宜；一頓早餐花了一千五百元，還請了各。郯城城區很小，車子穿過去不足兩分　。城鬥上題着「郯子故里」四個大字，二千餘年前的此地，正是冠蓋雲集的文物之邦，滄桑之感，不禁油然而生　由新安鎭到郯城間的公路，共軍破壞得很厲害，路面曲折的程度，有時稀，有時密，車子走上去，搖搖擺擺，坐在車中，眞像搖籃一樣。郯城向北，路面好得多，開出後二小時不足，記者越過沂水和兩旁廣闊的沙灘，路進了這雄踞在河南江北，為中共三大根據地的臨沂了。湯恩伯將軍為本報臨沂記者題安　　（本報記者凌松壽寄）（本報記者凌松壽攝）（上）湯恩伯將軍（舉左手者）在臨沂機塲。（下）六十三旅　遭桂旅長（手執總筒者）與李團長（在其左方者）在前綫。（本報記者凌松壽攝）國防第一綫·北方大壘堡　張垣的激流  十三日張家口快訊　本報特派記者竭忠　　國防部白部長和督察團走了，察省顯現着如暴風雨後的恬靜輕鬆。從聽到他們要來的消息，整個張家口就捲入「忙」的激流裏。每一個角落都為餘波震盪。機關裏忙於寫報告，要把將近半年辛苦經營的工作，做成紙上文軍。担任招待的人忙於籌備，由生活的安排，一直到每個環境的佈置，以致幾夜都不能好好睡覺。部隊忙於閱兵，從最高指揮官到班長誰不挑些毛病和在時間上打點折扣，早起晚睡，少不得「翻騰」幾天。　　飛機塲送走白部長，車站上接來督察團，送往迎來，忙煞了各位首長。每個人的神經都特別緊張，忙成了一片。　　察省收復後，像白部長這樣的中央大員，還是首次來視察，邊疆人民向來對中央的政治，關懷最殷切，感應最直接。正如白部長所說：「張家口是國防第一錢，北方重要堡壘。」主持國防大計的人，實在該多來幾趟，聽聽人民的疾苦，看看國防的需要，好決定怎樣做，如何做，雖然比行在察只停留兩天，接觸的又多是上層，對大環境諒已有相常暸解，邊疆人民希望不虛此行，對邊疆國防予以更多重視，多拿出些實際辦法，亦就不枉忙碌一場　　守住這座橋樑　　北邊國防的安危，是國運的槓桿，歷史告訴我們，中國變亂多發載自北方，抗戰先由北方打起，現在北方還未安定，共軍是由南方失敗跑向北方，最後失敗時或將跑向更北的邊境，共軍沒有忘情了察省，說不定會捲土重來，最近延安口號是「打通東路，開關北路」，張家口正是通往東北的橋樑。「擋住他們，不讓他們通過」，是今後察綏人民新的課題，命運的考騐。　　邊疆安定力量　　傳作義將軍領導的這一支勁旅，算得上邊疆安定力量，由綏西一到察省，從抗戰到平亂，常是以少勝多，沒有打過丟臉的敗仗，最近又活躍在平漢綫上，滿城打了勝仗、殲滅共軍有生力量不少，這幾天張家口街頭巷尾，傳播着勝利消息，民衆都當做談話資料，向人誇耀驕傲。　京滬的金鈔風潮傳來，並沒有引起察省人民的重視，美鈔在這裏沒有踪跡，百分之九十以上的人民和公務員，還都不認識美鈔的面目。黃金在人民的眼裏，除了作為裝飾品外，就少有別的用處，所以對於金鈔停止買賣，也就沒有多大影響。倒是因金鈔引起物價的波瀾，激盪起經濟的浪潮。平津糧價高，商人便將糧食東流，眼看這裏糧價要和平津此齊，於是當局採取了糧食出境限制辦法，先將雜糧定出官價，商人申請運糧出境，就得將百分之四十的糧，以公價賣給政府，商人算不出一點利潤，只好另打主意。這就有效的平衡糧價，穩定物價，誰知這幾天，張家口的物價，有的竟比平津還便宜，於是發生物資倒流現象，我們眞佩服商人的算盤機敏靈活！江西水利工程建設  三月十八日鄱陽快訊　本報特約記者俞寗頗　　淸馮道立作淮揚治水論說：「善治水者，逐無用之水，循序歸壑，留有用之水，灌溉田畝，以濟舟楫，則水不但無害於民，且有益於民，在乎人之利導耳。」　　歷來我國各省處置水患的方法，不外三策。一是「消」，即以科學的方法，根本消弭水患。是為積極的建設。次是「防」，即以人力防患於未發，是為消極的抗禦。其最下策者，是為「救」，這就是災象已成，事後起而從事挽救。如民二十年的大水災，全國損失總額。達二十億元，問接的損失，尤無可估計。　　贛省自民元以來，水旱之災，幾於無歲沒有。民四·民十三·之大水災，民十四之大旱災，損失已不可勝計。尤以民二十年之大水災，損失最重，災情嚴重約有九江·星子·彭澤·湖口·鄱陽·樂平·萬年·等二十縣，淹沒田禾，共四百四十餘萬畝，損失農作物的價值，達三千五百餘萬元。二十二年被旱災區，達七十餘縣，農作物損失面積，達二千七百餘萬畝，减收稻穀·豆·棉·麻·等五千一百餘萬石，總值一萬八千餘萬元。　　過去水利事業　廢弛不舉　　贛省水位地城，居長江的中部，江水琉經贛境的，僅自鄂省武穴下游至彭澤一段，水量最廣泛完全灌注境內的，即為鄱陽湖。鄱湖蓄水的來源，共有贛·撫·信·饒·修·五大河的支流，尤以贛江為本省主要水道，計長五百公里，自南而北，經十一縣境，北支流經樵舍至吳城入湖，東支經湖口入湖，除此二主支流，細小支流，狀如佈網。故全省水道區，祗一贛江流域，且有鄱陽為之容蓄停瀦，水系簡單，又無他省之利害衝突相干涉，整理施治，較他省為易推進。　　惟近八年來，因其間圩堤，各自成圍，都未作大規模之修防，損壞的處較多即鄱湖也因年久失修，湖泊淤淺，早失其蓄洩功能。其他上流支河，或因河洲日增，坡岸放墾，夏間洪流，來去過驟，河槽無刷深的餘暇，水冲的泥沙過多，沉澱於湖床，致江身日狹，堤防日廢。因各河兩岸低窪之地，全恃堤岸以為防範。這種堤岸，多係數十年前的建築物，灣曲旣不合度，基礎亦漸空虛，加以歷年潰決，久未大修，各堤身均未能達規定標準，一遇洪漲，即難倖存。　　民十六年，贛省始有水利局的設立，先後擬具整理全省水利甲乙二種計劃，呈請省府採行，經核定採用乙種。嗣以匪患蔓延，庫帑枯竭，上項計劃，未能實現。二十八二十九兩年。僅將各大堤決口修復，並督辦各堤歲修，加培工程。然以限於經費，各堤堤身，去規定標準所差尚遠。　　民二十四年，本省水利經費，計經常費為五萬七千元，事業費為十六萬元，以一省的水利經費，僅區區數萬元至十餘萬元，水利事業之廢弛不舉，自毋待言。是年全國經濟委員會江西辦事處，亦曾擬具「整理江西全省水利今後六年進行計劃書」，內分防洪工程，防旱灌溉工程，浚湖工程，浚河工程，研究治本工程，理由辦法，規劃極為詳盡，惜多未見諸施行。　　現在水利設施主要內容　　贛省水利，自前年復員後，即由主管當局，與贛善救分署，會商圩堤修復工程，以贛江為主要河流，因全省均屬贛江流域，水道分為五系，由贛江正流的撫河，饒河，信河，修河，全部圩堤，亦依河系，分為五類，再加揚子江琉經贛北，贛南的圩堤，共列為六系，分期進行復堤工程。截至上年十月止，全部工程，已完成百分之四十，此外關於水利的各種設施，其最主要的工作：　　（一）中心計劃　　「贛域安」計劃，即仿照美國ＫＶＡ計劃，為贛省戰後經濟中心工作，由水利局專司研究，並聘京。滬。水利專家來贛協助完成。其主要工程，是改良鄱陽水路系統，聯合為一，以「贛域安」整治贛江及鄱陽湖，興建鄱陽港。贛河炸灘，利用水力置閘發電，使灘成潭，初步

時期，當日堵口工作曾使水流灌入舊河道　綫內深達四英呎之多，但為時不長。此種情形在九月中高水位終了前遇另一同樣洪永峯時，可能重遇更深之流量。　　因此工程師均不顧任何困難，努力趕工，務冀早日完成。挑水工程完成後，則河南安徽二省之黃水泛區河道之淸理及耕地之修平等，聯總及行總之農業復興建設機構，應立即開始工作，並於泛區積水由淮河水道系流去後，立即播種農作物，以謀復興。至於黃水奪淮綫，對於淮河之傷害，究達如何程度，疏濬開挖，又須若干容積？才能恢復過去足以容納其本系各河流之流量，尚無法決定，須俟下年黃水復歸古道後，再可作適合之測量及擬訂淮河改善工程之計劃。（三十六年三月十六日於南京）</p>

<p>春秋美國近代雕刻  美Joseph　Piyoan著　田譯述　　人興奮的故事。在美國，許多新城市的建築和公園的建造，都需要彫刻和紀念性的紀念碑，所以，這一派別是必然要發展的。華盛頓的彫刻像建立的最早，例如，布拉文（Brown）在紐約協和廣塲彫刻的「華盛頓」，和窩德（Word，美國彫刻家，一八三八—一九一〇）在紐約合衆國分國庫彫刻的「華盛頓」。關於美國派進步的另一原因乃是由於從意大利回國的許多大理石彫刻師，他們從喀拉拉（Carrora）運回來很多未完成的大理石塊。這些優越的大理石入了美國國籍以後，曾經有一個時期；美國彫刻簡直是意大利化了。　　十九世紀美國最偉大的彫刻家當推聖哥當（Augustus　Saint　Caudens，生於愛爾蘭的美國彫刻家，一八四八—一九〇七），他生於愛爾蘭都伯林城（Dublin），父親是法國人，母親是愛爾蘭人，當他還是小孩子的時候就到了美國。二十歲的時候便出國到巴黎和意大利研究彫刻。他的作品中最著名的彫刻；如芝加哥林肯公園中的「林肯」，馬薩諸塞，春田的「淸敎徒」，和在巴黎盧森堡畫廊裏的“Amor　Caritas”。　　在聖哥當和其他同代的彫刻家們的作品當中並沒有過多的想像力，然而，最低限度在作品方面都具有高尙的格調，因此，在當時都很有威望。夫稜赤（Daniel　Chester　Fench，美國彫刻家，一八五〇—一九三一），巴那德（George　Grey　Barnard），塔夫脫（Lorado　Taft，美國彫刻家，一八六〇），安那。維（Anna　V．），韓廷頓（Hyatt　Huntington．），代表爲美國的卡排格斯（Carpeacix），羅丹（Dordiri法國彫刻家，一八四〇—一九一七），米尼爾（Meunier），和巴理（Barye，法國彫刻家，一七九五—一八七五）。現代尤其土著化了。曼西浦（Paul　Manship）像開特（Rockwell　Kent）的繪畫一樣，甚至在廉價的冒險當中產生出優美的作品。這裹，居留在我們本國的彫刻家，如佐拉克（William　Zorack），和拉齊恩(Gaston　Lorack），是美國彫刻當代的代表。其他未來的代表如住在倫敦的艾皮斯丁（Jacob　Epstein），斯騰（Maurice　Sterne），內利（Rouben　Nakian），維廉茲（Wheeler　Williams），菲尼（Paul　Fiene）和很多其他的彫刻家們。　　總觀美國這兩個世紀努力於藝術的人們已經離開正規的研究，而稍許陷入迷途，所以，「美麗的美國」—我們這樣稱呼她—雖然已有所表現；但是，並沒有什麼多大價値。甚至美國的繪畫和彫刻在目錄上已有很大的表現，可是，都是無止境的一些曼提馬太爾（Montmartre）的風景，意大利的林蔭公路，希臘，意大利，或西班牙的風光，然而很少有「柬方」或「西方」的景色，而且田園或種植物尤其稀少。想不到道樣大的一塊國土竟連精神的表象都是外國化的。　　但是，我們注意一下未來吧。看看那些大建築物，流綫型的火車，車子，影戲。當現代的房舍沒有大墻壁的時候，一定堅持着爲墻壁作畫乃是自殺的政策，將邊去的紀念物的形式再重複一　照樣是錯誤的。應當站在美國人的立塲研究美國，那末，一切東西必加諸於你。　　「我去之前，要唱一隻歌，歌頌美國。　　我要吹起喇叭，向所有安息的人們歌唱，　　爲了你—未來，　　我要爲你無盡的國體播一粒種籽……」惠特曼（Walt　Whitman）春在漕河涇  吳吉人　　春天到了，祥和陽的光，照射到每個人的身上，感覺到暖和和地得到一種說不出的愉快，人的精神，也會得興奮起來，侷處在市區的人們，正可以趁此明媚春光，到郊外去蹓躂蹓躂，吸一些新鮮空氣，聆略些春的景色，春的風光。　　滬西的龍華區，古塔梵影，香汛極盛，由龍華西去，的三里，走中山南路，轉滬閔公路，有曹園，經營得富麗，淪陷時期，損失尙微，該園佈置曲折，有山有水，極園林之幽趣，更西行里許，沿漕寶路，黃園在也，佔地五六十畝，得西子湖之雛形，規模宏偉，有亭·台·樓·閣·諸勝，惜一部份燬之於火，經此浩刦，損失奇重，茲雖足費游涉，而一片滄凉，徒供憑吊而已。聞主人有重修之說，大的須在秋間，黃園斜對岸，有康健園，頃正從事建設，聞爲一大規模之游泳池，爲飽琴軒君所經營，返經漕河涇街市，過共水橋，走冠生園路，抵冠生園農塲，農塲就工廠之東餘地所建，佔地的四十畝，刻正梅花盛放，有望梅軒·梅竹盧·綠蔭草堂等建築物，胥農邨風味，並有粵式菜餚，出廠餅點　客，因之游侶咸集此休憩哩。唐代舞裝  明玉畫報之母　梁得所  老丹　　我們談論到畫報，尤其是良友畫報，必定聯帶的談到梁得所；因爲他在中國出版界裏的大型畫報，做過不少的工作，由「良友」，「大衆」，而至「時代」，三個畫刋，尤以在「良友」的時期最長（約有八年），可以說是他在努力「良友」的時期，已奠定中國畫報的基礎。不信，您看「良友」自出版而至停版，它的銷路都超出同時其他畫報之上，甚至後來他主編的「大衆」和「時代」，也比不上「良友」出版數目。　　得所的履歷，簡單得很，在民二十年六月良友公司所出版的「當代中國名人錄」裏有一則是這樣寫的：「梁得所，年二十六歲，廣東人。齊魯大學肄業，現任良友圖書公司良友雜誌編輯。」他未到齊魯大學之前，在廣州培英中學畢業的。算到民國廿七年，他只有三十三歲，中年時期，正當做事的時候，可是他竟在大時代的來臨，全國對外偉大的抗戰中，廿七年八月八日，病死一在廣東連縣的故鄉中了。　　得所的身體，本來很軟弱，十多年孳孳矻矻的從事編輯，寫稿，譯著，交際的工作，已經是把他弄得忙不開交，加以他又好學深思，得閒的時候，都好轉念頭。對於刋物的如何改良與充實一，如何纔可以提高讀者的趣味，如何可以帮助讀渚的新知識，如何纔能推銷廣遠，如何羅致作家的寫稿，以及待人接物，無一不深謀遠慮。許多未實現的計劃，在他腦子裏天天把它嚴密的組織與隨時改進，因之有些人說他是富於理想的實現者，他自自也感覺到自已所計劃的事功，非常充實，立於不敗的地位，別人所不能想得到的。雖然有時也有失敗，但他不承認是自已的計劃失敗，而認爲是推行的或環境不凑合而已。　　他的病，非一朝一夕的了，固然病源很複雜，事工忙碌，沒有空閑去休養與運動，是它的主因。然而爲着幾次的失戀，使他精神上心靈上遭遇了永不能磨滅的創傷，實在是最大的打擊。還有平生所抱負的計劃受着不可挽回的崩潰，事業的失敗。因之外感內傷，相逼而來，精神，心靈，物質以及思想，無不遭受鉅大的損失與深刻的影響。試問一個一個三一十歲左右的文字工作者，又怎能支撑得住。病，痼疾，不用說　　記得民二十一年，他在上海虹橋療義院養病的時候，我去探望他。他睡在床上，還是時時刻刻的爲着刋物而計劃，爲着自己婚姻事而預爲佈置，爲着人事而調整，這些都是他放不下的事情。等到大衆出版社破產，他回到故鄕休養好幾時。後來重到上海，身體還是一樣的瘦弱。不久，在廣學會担任些工作，又不久，兼任「時代」的工作，那時他先住在江灣的鄉下，後來搬到德鄰公寓，過他刻苦恬淡的生活。　　詎料平生所未遭遇過的晴天霹靂的事件向他侵襲，使他生命史上深深的鐫刻着一段傷心事，試問多病之身「藥多於飯」的生活的梁得所，又怎樣能够支持。加以過了些時，又逢着蘆溝橋事件，八一三事件，國事人事，同時夾攻，他只得帶了病軀回到故鄉休養，而至於病死。　　得所除了畫報工作之外，還譯著了許多書籍，用了幾個筆名譯述世界名歌。巷良友公思賺過不少的錢。可是十多年來，他所服務的出版社，「大衆」最先破產，「時代」也因八一三戰事而停頓，「良友」後來雖在香港出版了幾個月，不久也因公司債務關係宣吿淸理而停頓。現在「良友」，「大衆」，「時代」都先後凋謝了，得所也逝世多年了，撫今追昔，能不掬一同情之淚！　　我們談到「良友」，我們看到其他的大型畫報，我們就不期然的聯想到梁得所來。梁得所在中國出版界裏永遠是給人們所惦記着。那麼，梁得所是「得所」的了，何曾是死的呢？滿江紅　集宋人詞句　題秋夜草疏圖卷并引  吳湖帆　　淸宣統三年辛亥十月十日，武昌舉義，十二日，江蘇撫臣程德全，向淸廷選最後忠吿一疏，請南通張季直先生主稿；帮同擬撰者，華亭雷繼興先生（奮），吳縣楊翼之先生（廷棟）也。疏進未獲察納，程氏即宣吿江蘇獨立，而蘇垣未動一兵，未流點血，賴獲以安，雷楊氏參佐程幕之功也。是疏之稿，前段爲張氏筆，中段爲雷氏筆，後段爲楊氏筆；今猶藏楊翼之先生處。廿年屬余補圖，裝成一卷。乙酉八月，重畫一問，題此詞。當時卷前後題者，皆與民國開國史多有關者，如程德全·張　·張一　·羅良鑑·應德閎（朱應鵬兄之生父）沈恩孚·黃炎培·梁啓超·孫寶琦·陳陶遺·伍輝裕·單鎭·夏敬觀·陳琛·徐果人，及楊翼之先生廷棟也。詞曰：　　故國情多（秦少遊），便無限凄凉行色（辛稼軒），誰不羨伏蒲忠鯁，演綸詞筆（毛樵隱）：有意挽回當世事（劉後村），武昌雲斾連天赤（張子湖）！想中原父老已心知（蔣竹山），東南坼（辛稼軒）。　　心耿耿（劉後村），孤燈剔（蔣竹山）；天相漢（史梅溪），成虛擲（陸放翁）。帶舊愁多少（陳西麓），漏聲寂寂（歐陽六一）；麟閣功名身外事（毛樵隱），千年誰復知今日（元遺山）！試側身回首望京華（張子湖）：空相憶（劉改之）。爲人作釋教圖像各題長句  朱應鵬　　我國美術，盛於晋唐，推原其因，不能不歸功於釋敎之東來。當時佛法經西域而與中國打成一片，東方文明之融合，斯爲極致，不僅政治經濟之溝溝通而已。此次大戰之後，印度文化之對於我國，對於世界，允具微妙之關係。研究之功，不可替也。　　（一）吉祥天女像　　薩羅縛底川，化身便作吉祥天。韋紐妃匹最勝緣，珠神玉貌現嬋娟。三尊一體義諦圓，生滅成壞衡其權。護法尊號那羅延，神妃功德相比肩。此日生民在倒懸，一飲一啄亦茍全。否極泰來望何年？惟心所造非偶然。願見火中生靑蓮，過去種種付雲烟，吉祥天女來翩躚，千禎百福長綿綿。　　（註）吉祥天女，爲韋紐天之妃，掌人天祥福。印土吠陀時代，河川之女神應羅縛底，爲地界諸神之最受崇奉者。能辟除不祥，與人以富饒及子孫。及梵書時代，又兼爲雄辯智慧之保護神。後此韋紐天妃吉祥天，及梵天妃辯才天，皆此神格之衍化也。梵天司創造、韋紐司保護，濕婆司破壞，成就三位一體。稱外道最勝三尊。韋紐在釋教中爲那羅延天，濕婆即大自在天，亦作摩醯首羅天。所謂天龍八部，皆印土處時崇奉之神。釋教具有統攝一切，圓融萬有之精神，亦即代表印度宗教哲學思想之究竟。西藏密宗之成立，實與固有之頗母教相融和。所謂現身說法，所謂本地埀跡，皆斯旨也。　　（二）韋馱天像　　一十八世將軍身，護持三寳願不泯，靈山受記轉法輪，三洲感應如其仁。五濁苦趣請具陳，魔母魔子繁其倫。是何因綠貪癡嗔，水深火熱逃無因。不辭頂禮稽首頻，化身千億莫逡巡。應機剪伐絕埃塵，金剛寳杵鎭波旬。要使天宇回熙春，無量功德書諸紳。　　（三）龍女獻珠　　　智積問訊手當胸，文殊昔住龍王宮。龍女顏色如花紅，利根慧業非凡蒙。於剎那間得圓通，菩提不退契大雄。聞者忽起分別裏，謂非法器障神功。女即現前翩驚鴻，啓佛爲我證覺空。寳珠無價光熊熊，我獻如來疾於風，成佛允速非難逢。坐寶蓮華凌蒼穹，相好光明無比隆，天衣瓔珞照玲瓏。法衆歡喜贊歎中，俯默豈獨歸詞窮，如是妙諦聖所崇，聞獅十吼將毋同。　　（註）龍女緣起，見妙法蓮華經提婆達多品第十二。就文學而觀，實爲世界最美之寓言。詩以叙之。名蹟經眼續記  潘伯鷹　　休沐之晨，風日晴美。與荊人相將踐伯駒觀一畫之諾。適友人孫君携其兩郎來，遂同車往。以一午間復有鷄黍之的，在伯駒處僅展視數件，因復一記之，以備遺忘云爾。　　一，李太白上陽臺題字墨蹟清宮舊藏。外一有黃綢紅裏袱子，乃是後加之物。其原裝卷子，以宋緙絲爲飾，深藍地，上作彩雲及桃花折枝。淸高宗御題籤。蓋乾隆間重裝者也。前有高宗御書靑蓮逸韻四大字。墨色特佳。此是紙本墨蹟。其原紙前後白綾隔水尙是宋時裝。上有宋徽宗御題「唐李太白上陽臺」七字，後有徽宗御跋。瘦金書極見筆意。其後淸高宗小楷釋文。太白墨蹟，他無所見，以云識別，戞乎其難。然其書奇縱渾厚，別開一宗。氣度格調，非宋人所能爲。警猶赤水之珠，乃象罔偶見者也。　　二，蔡襄自書詩册宋蔡君謨自書詩册，烏絲蘭作半寸許字。眞行草各體不拘一格。君謨經意書也。君謨書在宋四家中，最有法度。此書游行於規矩之中，而自得象外之妙。其轉筆換筆，處處皆有畦徑可尋。其詩亦可愛誦。中一首，在其旁下有字云：「此篇極有古人風格」，乃歐陽文忠公所書也。有此一行，益增名貴。蓋古人名蹟遺留至今不惟筆精墨妙而已。要在展觀之頃，慨然想見其爲人。如接其聲欬，而生仰止之思。所謂悵望千秋一灑淚者，乃眞若耳提而面命之也。嗚呼，其感人深矣！此册存八百餘字。其後宋元名賢題識甚多。而以楊龜山一跋爲允著。　　三，元顏輝煮茶圖卷顏輝畫玉川子煮茶圖小幅。玉川先生及長鬚奴，赤脚老婢，衣紋面目，皆用李龍眠白描法。布局（今人謂之構圖）亦是唐宋人之經營位置。其後草書韓退之贈玉川子詩，亦輝筆。輝書瘦勁有風骨，於康里子山頗近。樸茂處似更過於子山，惟精熟流暢差爲遜之耳。　　四，明周之冕墨筆百花圖卷此卷甚長，畫四季羣芳，墨中加有五采。其一種瀟灑天眞之趣，純從精熟中來。此意非近數十年趙之謙吳昌碩諸公所到也。明人間有題詩，皆在花旁。而以淸高宗題詠甚多，幾於一花一詩。其題野菊，有句云：「野也而人皆菊之。」以皇帝官家，出此頭中酸語。若使有歸來堂中俊侶，展卷賭茶，不將噴滿几案乎！　　五，王翬仿燕文貴江山無盡圖大橫卷此絹本靑綠江山無盡圖，烏目山人眞蹟也。自題云：「癸亥夏日避暑釜峯仿燕文貴眞本」，其後有王異公七會長古詩一首，備極推崇。余手邊無書可查。不知癸亥當是何時。意石谷此際在六十左右。筆意精能之極，已入蒼渾，卻無暮年枯　之病。石谷此畫爲張姓者所作。旣失之矣，又爲張之孫輩所得。黃小松有跋紀其詳。其前題籤亦小松筆也。　　六，淸初名家書畫集錦册淸初王士祿，查士標，羅收，程邃諸人凡十餘輩，爲孫豹人之子所作。龔半千題字，赫然居首。此物後歸李葆恂。葆恂字文石，端午據幕中評畫讀碑之俊流也。文石自記云：中更喪亂，文玩散失殆盡，而此册尙存。言之特爲感愴。此册在今日所觀諸品中爲最不足貴者矣。然以十年苦戰之餘生，猶流離於萬方浩刧之罅隙。讀李君悲慨之文，亦誠不自蔡其摩挲愛惜之意！（丁亥三月十七日燈下識）。自由談	不吃國糧吃囚糧  孟龍　　近來時常讀到這樣的新聞，說某黨派在某地吸收黨員或盟員，或者說某黨特派員在某地四出活動，誰願意入黨或加盟，不消說是「正中下懷」，樂於任用。這眞不禁呌人追想到明末淸初時代出示招「賢」的一幕：所謂「山林隱逸」，一股腦兒，如虎如狼，又飢又渴，紛紛出山，似有非做一番大事業不可之概。　　這一番大事業是否爲國爲民，且待事實表現之後再說，爲己是在所不免的，只要翻閱過明代歷史的人們，都會明白。一首諷刺詩，早已照射出了五臟與六腑！　　「聖朝特旨試賢良，一隊夷齊下首陽，家裏安排新雀帽，腹中打點舊文章，當年深自慚周粟，今日幡思食國糧，非是一朝忽改變，西山薇蕨喫精光！」　　　最可怕的，也許是喫完了西山薇蕨，還想喝咖啡，逛舞塲。前些日子，被開除黨籍的某某黨中央執行委員兼駐滬黨務特派員楊孝權（一名孝存），不正是一個活例子嗎？他除了想喫國糧之外，還踏進京華，大西洋，諸大酒菜館，還走入麗都，仙樂，等等舞塲，不僅如此，他還冒稱是警察分局某局長老友，簽出了空頭支票，詐騙了千餘萬元的鉅款！　　這位「特派員」大事未成，終究瑯璫入獄，喫囚糧去了；自然，就爲民除害一點看來，實在是不幸中之大幸。但是際此亂世，滑頭靑年，失意政客，企圖喫國糧而終於喫囚糧的，當不止楊孝權一人，又該如何防微杜漸呢？市府樂隊的重整　—不久即可聽到他們演奏了  倪秋萍　　上海市府管弦樂隊最近是由戴粹倫氏接辦主持了。戴氏是小提琴家，曾跟隨歐洲第一流小提琴家呼布曼Huberman多年，他現在同時並主持上海國立音樂院，所以戴氏主持這樂隊是最理想的人。　　這次市府管弦樂隊重整後，是由富華教授Prof．　A．　Foa擔任指揮。他是米蘭音樂院成績卓越的高材生。他在畢業之後在歐洲大陸各地表演小提琴演奏，到上海來了已有二十多年，是前工部局管弦樂隊聘請來的，起先擔任首席小提琴，後來兼任副指揮。他指揮的技巧確乎超過梅百器Maestro　Mario　Paci，雖然還有人以爲他力量不够，但是他指揮那繁複和細膩的樂曲，也是別人所不如的。指揮的重要猶如人的靈魂，今後這樂隊有了新的靈魂了。　　此外在樂隊裏有三位中國人加人任第一小提琴—譚抒眞，陳又新，與毛楚恩。譚氏從前加入工部局樂隊是中國人中最早的一位，別的中國人遠在他以後好些時候纔加入的。他並且精通製琴的技術。陳氏曾與丁善德創辦上海音樂院，對於音樂界有過不少的供獻。　　這回他們已經預備起來了，不久我們又可以聽到那久別的樂曲了。的確不久以前樂隊因爲指揮的關係，使我們聽不到他們所演奏不了的曲子，現在又可使我們和那些樂曲重逢了，恐怕更會覺得動人心弦的。一　　從前工部局管弦樂隊是遠東有數的樂隊，在中國是僅有的，可惜中國聽衆很少。自從勝利接收之後，就不很順利。我希望這一次的整頓，立下了以後的基礎，聘請國外的名手，選拔本國的音樂家。要在中國把音樂發達到水準綫以上，海市府管弦樂隊是負有重大使命的。同時還需要大家來欣賞，培養這朶藝術一之花。可怕的數字  劉夢　　據江海關稅務司統計科發表，去年度入超數爲一萬〇八百九十億五千〇四十三萬五千元。這「入超」二字是一種什麽意義，大家「有數」；至於這數字，無論目前幣値是如何的低落，用「相當驚人」，「相當龐大」這類字眼來形容它，私見以爲還不够，這簡直是一個可怕的數字。　　這數字內不見得沒有化裝品奢侈品等價値，眞正用於復興國家的「入超」,當然必須忍痛接受，不必要的「入超」而忍痛接受,那眞何苦來呢？　　又據赴日記者團某報代表牛若望先生回國後的報導，日本市面上外貨並不多，而且很少人問津。一個戰敗而受人管制的國家，有這樣的情形，和我們這個一萬餘億的數字相較之下，我們會起怎樣的感想呢？日本人的購買力遠不如我們嗎？　　然而「什麽配備」「什麽配備」早就流行在我們間了，這又有什麽話好說呢？　　如果一萬餘億的數字，有增無减的話，外來的借款儘多，咱們中國還是窮的，或許還會每况郞曹端方之死—淸末官塲貪侈之三  愛菊　　　　端之由南洋移節北洋也，駸駸有入贊中樞之勢，豈知日中則一昃，月盈則闕，李偉侯不滿二百一字之參摺，坐以大不敬，即冰山一遽倒，翩然下野矣。蓋兩宮上賓，梓宮殯過通衢，端竟敢遺人棲身樹上，對之攝影，眞可謂天奪其魄，胆大妄爲。而九門提督，竟不敢禁止，其氣錢抑何盛也。旣革職，乃蟄居半畝園，所謂半畝園者，即鴻雪因綠主人之遺宅也。小有園林，未嘗不可逍遙終老，無如端旣熱中，加以用度太侈，勢非再出不可，百計向當軸疏通，始得因川路風潮，重上政治舞台，竟爲亂黨所戕。至與其弟端六，皆同喪其元，吁，亦慘矣！豈非終食貪侈之報歟—至於所收羅者，除人所告知之巨蹟名品外，僞者亦不少。堂其籍者爲李虎臣君，凡華山禮器等漢碑，向李索取，皆得並几摩挲，而端亦於每夕，自侈其所藏，晚飰後羅列尊彝卷軸，應堂書室，所懸者類如四王，則滿壁皆四王，其他亦然，焉得不眞僞雜出哉，其人性喜虐謔，恒予人難堪，惟對於余與陶拙存，從未施以惡作劇，飲食之侈，當不太甚，惟冬間湯驢一只，爲庖中自製，究嫌過於殘忍，予與拙存，不忍下著焉。偉侯之摺，亦冒鶴汀手筆，一兩人皆曾遭端之虐謔者，怨毒之一於人甚矣哉！冒尙有二詩，亦題一於廣和居壁上，眞絕詩史也。余記其一聯云：「也當朱陳通嫁娶，本來雲貴是鄉親。」朱指朱經四之子，爲要人乾兒，陳則某督一。另一首結句允佳，乃寄生草對寄生花也。近時話劇，有裙帶風一齣，凡有裙帶關係者親之，亦稍稍發生其羞惡之心歟？煤礦怪物—看所謂生之意志  柳城　　　　我看到一段奇怪的新聞：四川某煤礦裏，有一個煤礦工人在礦中掘到一樣怪物，遍體生着很長的毛，全身祗剩下骨頭，沒有一點肉，口中嗚嗚作聲。這個礦工起初嚇了一大跳，隨後邀集了其他的工人將這怪物搬到礦外，發覺道怪物原是人類。推測他也是個礦工，有一决煤礦崩裂的時候被埋在地下的。可是他沒有死，他靠着吃煤生活着，等他被搬到礦外，他已經不能適應新的環境而立刻死去了。　　這個故事是够悲慘的。我想起了人類對生存的意志多麼强列，對生命的留戀又多麼執拗！一個國家，一個社會，一個人，都爲　生存而奮鬥着的。藝文壇　　臧克家的第一個短篇小說集「掛紅」，將由讀書出版社印行，內收短篇小說十一篇，共的十二萬字，聞將五月間出版　　范泉繼「綠的北國」後，將有第一一個散文集問世，書名爲「野口喜三八」，內大抵都是淪陷期間日本憲兵與平民的素描，材料及寫法異常別緻。　　施墊存前譯之「婦心」三部曲，近已由神州國光社刋印新版，計五百餘面，但新版印刷時，出版者却把三部曲的分標題遺忘了，這眞可以說是「美中不足」。　　田漢近在無錫，居於大和尙街，今明兩日內即將返滬，準備把連載在「文藝春秋」上的劇本「琵琶行」的續稿全部寫完。　　香港星島日報或將闢一純文藝性的文藝副刊，聞近在積極計劃中。你即是你  風　　太虛法師於民國二三年在普陀錫麟庵坐關後攝一影，長髮長鬚，乃自題云：「你，你，我認識你，我認識你，你就是你。」下書白太虛自題，頗具哲學意味。「欣償」  毛景初　　他正全神貫注在一張題名爲「春」的油廣，盡上是一個窈窕少女，僅以數片樹葉遮蓋着玉體上幾個要點。　　突然他的妻子尖聲呌道：「喂，在等什麽呀？—等秋嗎？」危城記  秦瘦鷗　　老徐心裏眞慌，太太不在家；把一個　女弄了進來，這還不是死罪嗎？而最寃的是金愛麗受了老祝的指導，搬來的時候，就聲明必須和胡太太住在一間房裏；並且這位胡太太也眞怪，好像也和老祝勾通一氣似的一直在裹面搗蛋，把金愛麗帶出帶進的簡直不讓老徐有碰到她的機會。　　「你沒有勸她留在柳州歇歇嗎？」徐胖子也知道小沈跟他太太相熟的程度，便帶着一種希冀問。　　「本來她是要跟我一起來的。」小沈也就老實吿訴他：「不巧我搭的那輛交通銀行的車子司機台已有兩個人佔了去，她坐不慣後面，才臨時變卦，打算搭明天亞西銀行的車子。」　　「我們那六輛車子都在柳州嗎？」諸協理最關心的是他那六輛卡車；在這六輛卡車身上，寄託着他下半世的快活。小小的一頂紗帽他是準備摜掉的。　　「都在那兒。有兩輛已經卸空了，可是，」小沈對他發出了幸災樂禍的一笑。「可是有兩家報上都在駡你們中茶公司，還說已有人在調查你們丟掉茶葉不運，反而包攬商貨的事。」　　「隨他們說去，反正車子開不到不到衡陽是事實。」赤鼻子的諸老頭見硬着頭皮說　　老徐沒精打采地放下了酒杯。　　「你回來又爲了什麽？」他向小沈問，目的是在打斷小沈和諸協理的談話，他不願意讓小沈再說下去，深恐聽的人心裏一怕，他打軍利用那六輛車子再運一批貨色的計劃便要落空了。　　「洋釘！洋釘！老兄，我還有三十桶洋釘沒有運走咧！」小沈焦灼地說：「我那兒比得上你的法力？」　　「怕什麽？人人長得漂亮，你也有你的路道！」　　小沈假惺惺地一笑。　　「這又不是開跳無會！」　　那個紅鼻子的諸協現半响沒有說話，低着頭在思素；忽兒把桌子一拍，打着滿口杭州音的官話，怒氣冲天地說：　　「我知道了，這一定是祝兆年他們那一帮人鬧的鬼，」小沈和老徐一時還聽不懂他指的是那一件事，愕然向他注視着。他才又期期艾艾地補充着說：「天地良心，我們這兒的事外人都不知道，就是老祝他們跟你們有來往，多少聽了一些去；他們又是最喜歡管閑事的，一高興就投稿到柳州的報紙上去駡我了！」（二）（二）獨泊漫談  王聰　　差近圓滿的人生，如李淸照趙明誠夫婦，居里夫婦等，這眞是千萬人中難得的佳偶。然而造化是妬嫉他（她）們的；許多意外的不幸接連地襲擊着他（她）們的半生。　　可是，也正因爲他（她）們的不幸；人們都婉惜地以自己無限美麗的哀怨與朦矓的依戀，去遞補歷史上差近三百六十度底美滿所遺憾下底空虛度數。　　缺憾之美，永遠生活在人類底夢幻中。牠震盪並且也洗刷了人類陰私的靈魂。　　人們如果對這些故事——偉大巨人所發生的不幸——仍無具同情與關聯之感的話，而一味追求着個人物質上的虛榮；那麽，我實在看不出人類有比禽獸更高明的地方。　　我不否定妻子或丈夫在家庭中所佔據的地位，可是，我願意套用柴霍甫的名實：「妻子或丈夫不過是一個妻子或丈夫而已。」而已兩個字，是耐人尋味的。直率地說，妻子或丈夫都很難獲得「愛之圓周」（恕我杜撰名辭）的那另一面。我承認夫婦之問應該有愛，但那種愛不能苛求爲必然是絕對的靈魂的另一面底愛。　　是故，婚姻關係以外

<h3>A Portion of a Certain Country's Troops Landed on Haiyang Island; Aiming to Control the Coastline</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 22nd] A warship from a certain country recently landed on Haiyang Island in the Changshan Islands, located at the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula in the East Sea, carrying over twenty armed troops equipped with radio equipment. They declared to the residents that the island had been occupied by their country before the Russo-Japanese War, and therefore they had the right to station troops there. The islanders are alarmed and many are fleeing to Zhuanghe to seek refuge.

Therefore, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference began discussing the German question from the second day, and to this day, only waves have been seen on the meeting table, and the</p>

<p>Domestic Quota Set at Ninety-Seven; Three Slots Reserved for Translators in the US</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Ministry of Education has set the translator study abroad examination to be held simultaneously in seven districts starting on April 1st, as mentioned in yesterday's report. Regarding the quota of 100, there has been much speculation since a certain newspaper published a message that 80 of them had been internally decided by the Ministry of Education. Translators in Shanghai once sent a letter to the Ministry of Education to inquire. This reporter specifically interviewed the spokesperson of the capital of education for detailed inquiries. According to the person in charge's response, according to the previous statistics of the National Foreign Affairs Bureau, there were more than 3,300 translators in the National Foreign Affairs Bureau. It was originally planned to select 360 people based on the ratio of one-tenth of the candidates. Later, due to the government's foreign exchange situation, it first approved the selection of 100 people. At first, the qualification restrictions were stricter, but later, at the request of the translators, it was approved to be relaxed. All translators with Foreign Affairs Bureau translator service certificates can apply for the exam as long as they have not committed any faults. These 100 places are the ratio of the total number of more than 3,600 in the country to 100. Therefore, three places are reserved for the 100 translators of the Foreign Affairs Bureau who are currently in the United States but have not been able to return to the country (based on the ratio of 360 to 100, the 100 in the US can occupy three places), so that they can study and study abroad, and they will also be selected according to the application method and procedures. Therefore, the examination of 100 domestic translators will actually admit 97 people, and the remaining three will be selected from translators of the Foreign Affairs Bureau in the United States, and there is no internal decision of other places.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education is Studying Detailed Rules for Printing Nationally Designated Textbooks</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Airmail] The Ministry of Education has already decided to open up the publishing rights for nationally designated textbooks and announced the printing methods. Recently, due to soaring costs and low price limits, only three publishers have submitted applications to the Ministry of Education requesting to print, and none of them have attached sample books, and have not identified the printing area, subjects, and minimum printing quantity, so the Ministry of Education has no way to issue licenses. There are many problems of this kind that were not explicitly stipulated in the printing methods previously issued by the Ministry of Education. In order to be detailed, it has specially handed over to Liu Yingshi, Jiang Fuxing, Zhao Shiqing and the relevant department chiefs to jointly formulate implementation details, which are currently being studied in detail. It is reported that the writing, drawing and typesetting design of the old printed versions of the Seven United Offices were originally invested by the Seven United Offices. According to the law, they should be regarded as the property of the Seven United Offices. Other publishers cannot copy and reprint them in the same style, and must design and produce their own plates. The Ministry of Education has already paid attention to this issue, and hopes that publishers can each display their skills and compete with each other. It is also learned that the Seven United Offices has recently hired legal counsel to study in detail how to protect various legal rights in accordance with the Civil Code and the Copyright Law, so as to avoid being subjected to violence, illegal misinterpretation and infringement, and to initiate administrative or civil and criminal lawsuits to recover considerable losses when necessary.</p>

There are now five colleges and twenty-six departments: The College of Letters has five departments: Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages, Philosophy, History, and Language Anthropology; the College of Science has seven departments: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Meteorology, and Psychology; the College of Law has four departments: Law, Politics, Economics, and Sociology; the College of Engineering has six departments: Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Aeronautics, Chemical Engineering, and Architecture; and the College of Agriculture has four departments: Agronomy, Plant Pathology, Entomology, and Plant Physiology. In terms of administration, in accordance with the Ministry's orders, there are one hundred and eleven sections and offices, including the Academic Affairs Office, the Secretariat, and the Student Affairs Office. The Academic Affairs Office has a Registration Section and a Library. The Secretariat has a Documentation Section, a Cashier Section, a General Affairs Section, and a School Medical Office. There are also a President's Office and an Accounting Office. In addition, there are various committees to assist in the operation of the school. Those belonging to the administrative part include the Appointment Committee, the Engineering Committee, the Library Committee, the Equipment Committee, the Fuel Supply Heating Equipment Committee, the Power Supply Control Committee, the School Scenery Committee, the Publishing Committee, and the University Overview Committee. Those belonging to student life guidance include the Training Committee (divided into three groups to be responsible for: 1. Student food and lodging guidance, 2. Publicly funded and student relief, 3. Student extracurricular activity guidance, etc.) and the First-Year Course Guidance Committee, and the Scholarship Committee. Those belonging to the welfare of colleagues include the Housing and Dormitory Allocation Committee, the Faculty and Staff Mutual Benefit Cooperation Committee, and the Faculty and Staff Consumer Cooperative. With this collective effort, the restoration work of the school can proceed smoothly, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>The situation of our school after the restoration is roughly as described above. Due to economic difficulties, we can only reach the stage where we can barely work. As for the supplementation and restoration, it is not easy to complete with the manpower and financial resources of several years. Our hope should not be satisfied with restoring the old appearance, but must make it more developed and brilliant, so as to shoulder the mission that Tsinghua should bear. This is why the faculty and staff of our school are still working diligently day and night even today when the school's restoration work is largely completed.</p>
<p>Tsinghua's current problems are the shortage of school buildings (classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, residences, etc.) in terms of material aspects, and the need for a large amount of supplementation of library equipment. In terms of policy, in addition to planning and training a large number of young people, we should also pay attention to the promotion of academic research. This was already implemented before the war and should be promoted further in the future. Because of the capacity of our school, the number of students must be limited in the end, so it is better to focus more on quality and less on quantity, and abandon its breadth and seek its depth. Recent additions to buildings are almost impossible, and housing allocation must be squeezed, but internal equipment must be strengthened, and teachers in various departments must be recruited in many ways, so that those who want to come to our school cannot be accommodated as much as possible, but those who leave our school must have their own expertise. And in terms of academic research, Tsinghua has already made some contributions before the war and during the war of resistance. Future achievements cannot be predicted, but just like planting trees, if you choose good seeds, plant them properly, cultivate and irrigate them, and do your best to maintain them, then spring flowers and autumn fruits will be natural harvests.</p>
<p>In addition, the selection of publicly funded students to study in the United States is a consistent policy of Tsinghua. Issues such as the connection and exchange with foreign academic institutions should also be noted. As for how to implement it, we will plan it in detail in the future and proceed according to the opportunity.</p>
<p>Recently, alumni from various places often have a need to inquire about school affairs and prepare to donate. The alumni's enthusiasm for protecting their alma mater is deeply gratifying. In today's school situation, from a school building to a few books, we welcome large donations. To be more specific, if it is a steel frame on one floor of the new library, or a wooden block floor in the new gymnasium, or an alumni building for alumni receptions, or a certain type of Chinese or Western books, or a certain batch of experimental equipment, if the alumni can donate collectively, donating any one item is enough to be a permanent memorial. The so-called timely righteous act is truly a blessing to infinity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the start of the restoration in May of last year to the start of school in mid-October, in these five months, a total of four or five thousand teachers, students, and their families, old and young, moved from Kunming on the southwest border to Beiping and Tianjin, traveling thousands of miles, by land, sea, and air. In terms of our school alone, there were about two thousand teachers and students. Along the way, we received enthusiastic help from alumni and people from all walks of life, so that all of them could arrive safely as scheduled. In addition to describing the restoration of our school, Qi hereby expresses his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of all colleagues.</p>

<h3>First Half</h3>
<p>At 3:00 pm, referee Huang Renyi and linesmen Le Xiurong and Lu Shunde took the stage to enforce the law. Youyou attacked first, and Qingbai's center back line was strong, unable to penetrate deeply. At 7 minutes, Li Yichen broke through the enemy alone, and Qingbai set the record for 1 to 0. Youyou's counterattack was ineffective. At 16 minutes, Yichen scored twice, leading 2 to 0. Qingbai's Yan Wu was like an iron gate, and Youyou's forwards could not break through. Although Hu Youcheng once knocked on the door, he was also saved by Huang Shijie. At the end of the first half, Jiang Guan Qing cleared the ball past Rongguang and hooked it into the goal from the corner. The first half ended with Qingbai leading 3 to 0.</p>
<h3>Second Half</h3>
<p>After switching venues and fighting again, Qingbai's lineup was greatly changed. Youyou continued to respond with the original eight horses.

Huang Shijie could not save it, 3 to 1, Youyou pulled back one goal. Qingbai was unwilling to show weakness after this counterattack. At 25 minutes, Wu Jialu and Meng Yiliang exchanged positions.

Among them, in the men's seventh game, Guanghua defeated Pudong. The game was close and tense from beginning to end.

<h3>Rambling Notes on the Basketball Court</h3>
<p>The championship final of the Basketball League Division A1 group last night was unprecedentedly grand in the municipal gymnasium. No less than five or six hundred people were rejected outside the door due to being full. The gymnasium was crowded with people, with almost no space to stand.</p>
<p>Cairo and Giant, two Encas soldiers fought, and both sides focused on defense in the first half, relying only on mid-range shooting to attack. In the second half, Encas controlled the offensive, and V. Kairoski and Ao Chailiao both had good shots close to the basket, and finally defeated Giant by three goals. The defeat of Giant should be attributed to Ye Long's poor performance, with countless shots wasted, and Tao Berlinji's mid-range shooting was also far below the usual standard.</p>
<p>Hualian fought with all its strength against the ever-victorious army of Youlu yesterday, and the situation was not tense.</p>
<p>Da Li went on the court and used all his energy to guard He Lide, and Lao Bao watched Chen Qingjiang, so Hualian occupied the advantage of the ball under the basket and reduced the Shantou team's scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>In the first half, Ren Xiangcheng could not defend Lin Weicong, so Kong Guangyi replaced him. As a result, all three forwards of the Shantou team were bound and no one was shooting. Lao Bao served as a forward and hit every shot, leading 26 to 11 in the first half.</p>
<p>Kong Guangyi's strength was not good in the second half, and Lin Weicong took the opportunity to be active, forcing the score from 33 to 19 to 35 to 26, which was the golden age of the Shantou team.</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang was restrained by Cai Yanxiong and could not use his skills. Fortunately, Chen Xuechong was steady, so Hualian was not threatened in the second half.</p>
<p>The Shantou team lost to Hualian once, and became equal, waiting for another battle to determine the first seat, but Hualian has a stronger hope of winning the championship. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>Sellers' Arrogance is Strong; Shanghai Stock Market Prices Decline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai stock market saw even more fragile confidence yesterday. With the overall trend gone, sellers' arrogance was overwhelming. In the ten minutes before closing, short sellers were replenishing positions, which seemed firm. Unexpectedly, within five minutes, the price plummeted by 150 yuan and closed at a low price. Absurd rumors, such as the cancellation of spot delivery, were able to become tools for short sellers to cut prices, which shows that people are gradually losing faith in the stock market.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>The morning opening was based on the unreliability of statements such as the collection of cash guarantees and the success of loans. Spot deliveries appeared weak, and short positions in the spot market were replenished and remained stable. After the opening, numbers 198, 133, 102, 224, and 14 all rose, and Diyong Yarn rose to</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn American Modern Sculpture, written by Joseph Piyoan, translated and narrated by Tian: A Story of Human Excitement. In the United States, the construction of many new cities and parks requires sculptures and monumental memorials, so this school of thought is bound to develop. The earliest sculptural statues in Washington were established, such as Brown's "Washington" sculpted at Concord Square in New York, and Word's "Washington" sculpted at the United States Sub-Treasury in New York. Another reason for the progress of the American school is due to the many marble sculptors who returned from Italy, and they brought back many unfinished marble blocks from Carrora. After these superior marbles became American citizens, there was a period when American sculpture was simply Italianized. The greatest American sculptor of the nineteenth century was Augustus Saint Caudens (an American sculptor born in Ireland, 1848-1907). He was born in Dublin, Ireland, his father was French, and his mother was Irish. He went to the United States when he was a child. At the age of twenty, he went abroad to Paris and Italy to study sculpture. His most famous sculptures include "Lincoln" in Lincoln Park, Chicago, "The Puritan" in Springfield, Massachusetts, and "Amor Caritas" in the Luxembourg Gallery in Paris. There is not much imagination in the works of Saint-Gaudens and other contemporary sculptors, however, at the very least, their works have a noble style, so they were very prestigious at the time. Daniel Chester Fench (American sculptor, 1850-1931), George Grey Barnard, Lorado Taft (American sculptor, 1860), Anna V. Huntington represent the American Carpeacix, Rodin (French sculptor, 1840-1917), Meunier, and Barye (French sculptor, 1795-1875). Modern times are especially vernacular. Paul Manship, like Rockwell Kent's paintings, produces beautiful works even in cheap adventures. Here, sculptors residing in our country, such as William Zorack and Gaston Lorack, are contemporary representatives of American sculpture. Other future representatives include Jacob Epstein, Maurice Sterne, Rouben Nakian, Wheeler Williams, Paul Fiene, and many other sculptors living in London. Looking at the people who have worked hard in art in the United States for these two centuries, they have left formal studies and fallen into confusion. Therefore, "Beautiful America"—as we call her—although there have been some achievements, there is not much value. Even American paintings and sculptures have great performances in the catalog, but they are endless Montmartre landscapes, Italian boulevards, Greek, Italian, or Spanish scenery, but rarely "Eastern" or "Western" scenery, and pastoral or plant-related scenes are especially rare. It is unexpected that such a large piece of land has a foreignized spiritual representation. But let's pay attention to the future. Look at those large buildings, streamlined trains, cars, and movies. When modern houses have no big walls, insisting on painting for the walls is a suicidal policy, and repeating the forms of disappearing monuments is also wrong. We should study the United States from the perspective of Americans, then everything will be added to you. "Before I leave, I want to sing a song, praising America. I want to blow the trumpet and sing to all the resting people, For you—the future, I want to sow a seed for your endless national system..." Walt Whitman.</p>
<p>Spring in Caohejing, Wu Jiren: Spring has arrived, and the peaceful sunshine shines on everyone, feeling warm and getting an unspeakable joy. People's spirits will also be excited. People living in the city can take advantage of this bright spring to stroll in the suburbs, breathe some fresh air, and listen to the scenery of spring and the scenery of spring. The Longhua District in West Shanghai, with its ancient pagoda and flourishing incense, goes three miles west from Longhua, takes South Zhongshan Road, and turns to Hu Min Highway. There is Cao Garden, which is managed magnificently. The losses during the period of the fall are still small. The garden is arranged in a tortuous manner, with mountains and rivers, extremely secluded in the garden. Further west, along Cao Bao Road, Huang Garden is also there, covering an area of fifty or sixty acres, obtaining the prototype of West Lake, with a magnificent scale, with pavilions, terraces, buildings, and other scenic spots. Unfortunately, a part of it was destroyed by fire. After this catastrophe, the losses were extremely heavy. Although it is enough to spend money on sightseeing, a piece of desolation is only for mourning. I heard that the owner has plans to renovate it, but the big ones must be in the autumn. Opposite Huang Garden is Kangjian Garden, which is currently engaged in construction. It is said to be a large-scale swimming pool, operated by Mr. Bao Qin Xuan. Returning through Caohejing Street, passing Gongshui Bridge, walking on Guanshengyuan Road, and arriving at Guanshengyuan Farm, the farm is built on the eastern surplus land of the factory, covering an area of forty acres. The plum blossoms are currently in full bloom. There are buildings such as Wangmei Pavilion, Meizhulu, and Green Shade Cottage, all with rural flavors, as well as Cantonese dishes and factory-made cakes. Therefore, tourists gather here to rest.</p>
<p>Tang Dynasty Dance Costume, Mother of Mingyu Pictorial, Liang Desuo Lao Dan: When we talk about pictorials, especially Liangyou Pictorial, we must also talk about Liang Desuo; because he has done a lot of work in large-scale pictorials in the Chinese publishing industry. From "Liangyou", "Dazhong", to "Shidai", three pictorials, especially the period in "Liangyou" was the longest (about eight years). It can be said that it was during his efforts in "Liangyou" that he laid the foundation of Chinese pictorials. If you don't believe it, you can see that from the publication of "Liangyou" to its discontinuation, its sales exceeded other pictorials at the same time. Even the "Dazhong" and "Shidai" that he later edited could not compare with the number of publications of "Liangyou". Desuo's resume is very simple. In the "Contemporary Chinese Celebrities Record" published by Liangyou Company in June 1931, there is a passage that reads: "Liang Desuo, 26 years old, from Guangdong. Studied at Qilu University, currently editor of Liangyou Magazine at Liangyou Bookstore." Before going to Qilu University, he graduated from Guangzhou Peiying Middle School. Counting to 1938, he was only thirty-three years old, in his middle age, when he should be doing things, but he died of illness in his hometown of Lianxian, Guangdong, on August 8, 1938, during the arrival of the great era and the great national war of resistance against foreign aggression. Desuo's body was originally very weak. He had been working hard as an editor, writing, translating, and socializing for more than ten years, which had already made him very busy. In addition, he was eager to learn and think deeply. When he was free, he liked to turn his mind. He thought deeply about how to improve and enrich publications, how to improve readers' interests, how to help readers' new knowledge, how to promote them widely, how to recruit writers to write, and how to treat people. Many unrealized plans were closely organized and improved in his mind every day. Therefore, some people said that he was a fulfiller of ideals, and he also felt that the things he planned were very fulfilling and stood in an invincible position, which others could not imagine. Although there were failures sometimes, he did not admit that his plan had failed, but believed that the promotion or environment was not suitable. His illness was not a matter of one day or two. Of course, the source of the illness was very complicated, and being busy with work and not having time to rest and exercise was the main reason. However, several unrequited loves caused indelible wounds in his spirit and soul, which was the biggest blow. In addition, the plans he had cherished all his life were facing irreversible collapse, and his career failed. Therefore, external and internal injuries came one after another, and his spirit, soul, material things, and thoughts all suffered great losses and profound influences. How could a writer in his early thirties bear it? The illness, the chronic disease, needless to say Remember in 1932, when he was recuperating in the Hongqiao Therapy Institute in Shanghai, I went to visit him. He was lying in bed, still planning for the publication all the time, making arrangements for his own marriage, and adjusting for personnel matters. These were things he couldn't let go of. After the Dazhong Publishing House went bankrupt, he returned to his hometown to recuperate for a long time. Later, he returned to Shanghai, and his body was still as thin as before. Soon, he took on some work in the Guangxue Society, and soon after, he also worked for "Shidai". At that time, he first lived in the countryside of Jiangwan, and later moved to Delin Apartment, living his hard and peaceful life. Unexpectedly, an unexpected thunderbolt struck him, deeply engraving a sad event in his life. How could Liang Desuo, who was sick and whose life was "more medicine than food", support it? In addition, after some time, he encountered the Lugouqiao Incident and the August 13 Incident. National and personal affairs attacked at the same time. He had to take his sick body back to his hometown to recuperate, and then died of illness. In addition to his work on pictorials, Desuo also translated many books, using several pen names to translate world-famous songs. Xiang Liangyou Gongsi earned a lot of money. However, over the past ten years, the publishing houses he served, "Dazhong" went bankrupt first, "Shidai" also stopped due to the August 13 war, and "Liangyou" later published in Hong Kong for a few months, but soon announced liquidation and stopped due to company debt relations. Now "Liangyou", "Dazhong", and "Shidai" have all withered one after another, and Desuo has also passed away for many years. Looking back on the past, how can we not shed tears of sympathy! When we talk about "Liangyou", when we see other large-scale pictorials, we can't help but think of Liang Desuo. Liang Desuo will always be remembered by people in the Chinese publishing industry. Then, Liang Desuo is "Desuo", how can he be dead?</p>
<h3>Manjianghong, Collected Song Dynasty Ci Sentences, Title Autumn Night Grass Sparse Picture Scroll with Introduction, Wu Hufan: On October 10th, 1911, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. On the 12th, Cheng Dequan, the Jiangsu Governor, submitted a final loyal memorial to the Qing court, requesting Mr. Zhang Jian from Nantong to draft it. The people who helped draft it were Mr. Lei Jixing (Fen) from Huating and Mr. Yang Yizhi (Tingdong) from Wuxian. The memorial was not accepted, and Cheng announced the independence of Jiangsu. However, Suzhou did not move a single soldier or shed a drop of blood, and was able to secure peace, thanks to the assistance of Lei and Yang. The first section of the memorial was written by Zhang, the middle section by Lei, and the last section by Yang. It is still kept at Mr. Yang Yizhi's place. Twenty years later, I was asked to add a picture, which was mounted into a scroll. In August of 1945, I repainted one and inscribed this poem. The inscribers on the front and back of the scroll at that time were mostly related to the history of the founding of the Republic of China, such as Cheng Dequan, Zhang Jian, Zhang Yiyi, Luo Liangjian, Ying Dehong (the biological father of Zhu Yingpeng's brother), Shen Enfu, Huang Yanpei, Liang Qichao, Sun Baoqi, Chen Taoyi, Wu Huiyu, Shan Zhen, Xia Jingguan, Chen Chen, Xu Guoren, and Mr. Yang Yizhi Tingdong. The poem says: Old country full of affection (Qin Shaoyou), then boundless desolate travel (Xin Jiaxuan), who does not envy Fu Pu's loyal and outspoken, Yan Lun's words and writing (Mao Qiaoyin): Intending to save the affairs of the present world (Liu Houchun), Wuchang Yunpai connects to the sky red (Zhang Zihu)! Thinking that the elders in the Central Plains already know it in their hearts (Jiang Zhushan), southeast tear (Xin Jiaxuan). Heart loyal (Liu Houchun), lonely lamp tick (Jiang Zhushan); Heaven helps Han (Shi Meixi), into vain throw (Lu You). With old sorrow how much (Chen Xilu), drip voice silent (Ouyang Liuyi); Lingge fame outside things (Mao Qiaoyin), who knows today for a thousand years (Yuan Yishan)! Try to turn around and look back at Jinghua (Zhang Zihu): empty miss (Liu Gaizhi).</h3>
<h3>Composed Long Poems for Buddhist Images, Zhu Yingpeng: Chinese art flourished in the Jin and Tang Dynasties. To trace the reason, we must attribute it to the eastward transmission of Buddhism. At that time, Buddhism passed through the Western Regions and became one with China. The integration of Eastern civilization reached its peak, not only in the communication of politics and economy. After this war, Indian culture has a subtle relationship with China and the world. The work of research should not be replaced.</h3>
<p>(1) Image of Goddess of Auspiciousness: Saraswati River, incarnated as Goddess of Auspiciousness. Vishnu's concubine is the most auspicious fate, the jewel god jade face appears charming. The three honored ones are one in righteousness, birth, destruction, success, and failure are balanced. The protector is called Narayana, the merits of the goddess are comparable. Today the people are in dire straits, one drink and one peck are also fulfilling. When will the bad times turn into good? The only thing created by the heart is not accidental. I wish to see the blue lotus growing in the fire, let the past be like smoke, the Goddess of Auspiciousness comes dancing, thousands of blessings and hundreds of fortunes last for a long time. (Note) The Goddess of Auspiciousness is the concubine of Vishnu, in charge of human and heavenly auspiciousness. In the Vedic era of India, the river goddess Yingluobodi was the most revered among the gods of the earth. It can ward off misfortune and give people wealth and offspring. In the era of Brahma Sutras, it also served as the protector of eloquence and wisdom. Later, Vishnu's concubine, the Goddess of Auspiciousness, and Brahma's concubine, the Goddess of Eloquence, were both derived from this god. Brahma is in charge of creation, Vishnu is in charge of protection, and Shiva is in charge of destruction, achieving the Trinity. It is called the most victorious Trinity of the outer way. Vishnu is Narayana in Buddhism, and Shiva is the Great自在天, also known as Maheśvara. The so-called Eight Divisions of the Heavenly Dragon are all gods worshiped in India at that time. Buddhism has the spirit of integrating everything and harmonizing all things, which also represents the ultimate in Indian religious and philosophical thought. The establishment of Tibetan Tantric Buddhism is actually integrated with the inherent Bon religion. The so-called preaching by manifestation and the so-called local traces are all about this.</p>
<p>(2) Image of Skanda: The eighteenth generation is the body of a general, upholding the three treasures and the wish will not be extinguished, Ling Mountain accepts the memory and turns the wheel of the Dharma, the three continents respond as their kindness. Please present the five turbidities and bitter interests, the demons and their children are numerous. What is the cause of greed, anger, and ignorance, the water is deep and the fire is hot and there is no way to escape. I don't hesitate to bow down and kowtow frequently, incarnating billions, don't hesitate. Cut down the dust in response to the opportunity, the Vajra treasure pestle towns the waves. To make the sky return to Xichun, countless merits are written on the robes.</p>
<p>(3) Dragon Girl Offering Pearls: Zhiji asks with hands on his chest, Manjushri used to live in the Dragon King Palace. The dragon girl's face is as red as a flower, her sharp roots and wisdom are extraordinary. She attained perfection in an instant, and Bodhi does not retreat to match the Great Hero. Those who hear it suddenly arise in distinction, saying that illegal instruments hinder divine power. The woman immediately appears like a startled swan, and tells the Buddha to prove her enlightenment. The priceless treasure pearl shines brightly, I offer it to the Tathagata faster than the wind, becoming a Buddha is quick and not difficult to meet. Sitting on the lotus flower Ling Cangqiong, the auspicious appearance is incomparably prosperous, the heavenly clothes and necklaces shine brightly. In the praise of the Dharma assembly, bowing silently is not just a return to words, such wonderful truths are revered by the saints, hearing the ten lion roars will not be the same. (Note) The origin of the Dragon Girl is found in the twelfth chapter of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, Devadatta. From a literary point of view, it is the most beautiful allegory in the world. The poem narrates it.</p>
<h3>Continued Records of Famous Traces, Pan Boying: On a morning of rest, the wind and sun are clear and beautiful. I will go to Boju with Jingren to fulfill the promise of watching a painting. Just then, my friend Sun Jun came with his two sons, so we went together in the same car. Because there is a promise of chicken and millet at noon, only a few pieces were displayed at Boju's place, so I recorded it again to avoid forgetting.</h3>
<p>1. Li Taibai's inscription on Yangtai is a treasured collection of the Qing Palace. There is a yellow silk red lining on the outside, which was added later. The original mounted scroll is decorated with Song Ke silk, with a deep blue background, with colorful clouds and peach blossom branches. Qing Gaozong's imperial title tag. It was remounted during the Qianlong period. In front, there are four large characters of Qing Gaozong's imperial book Qinglian Yiyun. The ink color is particularly good. This is a paper manuscript. The white silk partitions before and after the original paper are still from the Song Dynasty. There are seven characters of Song Huizong's imperial title "Tang Li Taibai Shang Yangtai" on it, and Huizong's imperial postscript behind it. The thin gold script is very artistic. Behind it is Qing Gaozong's small regular script explanation. I have not seen other manuscripts of Taibai, so it is difficult to identify them. However, its calligraphy is strange, bold, and profound, opening up a new school. The bearing and style cannot be achieved by the people of the Song Dynasty. It is like a pearl of Chishui, which is occasionally seen by Xiang Wang.</p>
<p>2. Cai Xiang's self-written poetry album, Song Cai Junmo's self-written poetry album, is written in black silk orchid with characters about half an inch in size. The true, running, and cursive scripts are not restricted by one style. Junmo wrote it with care. Junmo's calligraphy is the most standard among the four masters of the Song Dynasty. This calligraphy travels within the rules and regulations, and obtains the wonderfulness beyond the image. Its turning strokes and changing strokes all have furrows to follow. Its poetry is also lovely to recite. In one of the poems, there are words beside it: "This article is very ancient in style", which was written by Ouyang Wenzhong. With this line, its reputation is further enhanced. The famous traces of the ancients that have been left to this day are not only exquisite in pen and ink. It is necessary to imagine what kind of person he is when he is exhibiting it. It is like receiving his voice and coughing, and giving birth to the thought of admiration. The so-called lamenting the millennium and shedding tears is truly like hearing the ear and instructing the face. Alas, it is deeply moving! This album contains more than 800 words. There are many inscriptions by famous sages of the Song and Yuan Dynasties behind it. Yang Guishan's postscript is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>3. Yuan Yan Hui's Tea Cooking Picture Scroll. Yan Hui painted a small picture of Yu Chuanzi cooking tea. Yu Chuanzi, the long-bearded slave, and the barefoot old maid, their clothes, lines, faces, and eyes, all use Li Longmian's line drawing method. The layout (now called composition) is also the management and position of the Tang and Song people. Behind it, the cursive script of Han Tuizhi's poem to Yu Chuanzi is also Hui's pen. Hui's calligraphy is thin and vigorous with style, quite close to Kangli Zishan. It is more vigorous and simple than Zishan, but its exquisite proficiency is slightly inferior.</p>
<p>4. Ming Zhou Zhimian's ink painting of Hundred Flowers Picture Scroll. This scroll is very long, painting the flowers of the four seasons, with five colors added to the ink. Its kind of unrestrained and natural interest comes purely from exquisite proficiency. This idea is not achieved by Zhao Zhiqian, Wu Changshuo, and other gentlemen in recent decades. There are poems inscribed by the people of the Ming Dynasty, all beside the flowers. Qing Gaozong inscribed the most poems, almost one poem for one flower. There is a sentence in his inscription on wild chrysanthemums: "Even if it is wild, people are all chrysanthemums." As an emperor and official family, he uttered such sour words. If there are handsome companions in the Gui Lai Hall, exhibiting the scroll and betting on tea, wouldn't they spray it all over the table!</p>
<p>5. Wang Hui's imitation of Yan Wengui's Endless Rivers and Mountains Picture Scroll. This silk blue and green Endless Rivers and Mountains Picture is the true work of Wumu Shanren. It is inscribed: "In the summer of Guihai, avoiding the heat at Fufeng, imitating Yan Wengui's true copy." Behind it is Wang Yigong's seven-meeting long poem, which is extremely respectful. I don't have a book at hand to check. I don't know when Guihai was. I think Shigu was around sixty years old at this time. The brushwork is extremely exquisite and capable, and it has entered into vastness, but there is no disease of old age and withering. This painting by Shigu was made for the Zhang family. After it was lost, it was obtained by Zhang's grandchildren. Huang Xiaosong has a postscript recording its details. The title tag in front is also written by Xiaosong.</p>
<p>6. Album of Calligraphy and Painting by Famous Artists in the Early Qing Dynasty. Wang Shilu, Cha Shibiao, Luo Shou, Cheng Sui, and more than a dozen other people in the early Qing Dynasty, were made for the son of Sun Baozhan. Gong Banqian's inscription is prominently displayed at the top. This item later belonged to Li Baoxun. Baoxun, whose character is Wenshi, is a talented person who judges paintings and reads steles in the curtain during the Dragon Boat Festival. Wenshi himself recorded: During the chaos, the literary and playthings were almost lost, but this album still exists. His words are particularly sentimental. This album is the least valuable of all the items seen today. However, with the remaining life after ten years of hard war, it still wanders in the gaps of the great catastrophe. Reading Li Jun's sorrowful text, it is also sincere not to admire his caressing and cherishing intention! (Written under the lamp on the 17th day of the third month of Dinghai).</p>
<h3>Free Talk: Not Eating National Grain, Eating Prisoner Grain, Meng Long: Recently, I often read news like this, saying that a certain party is absorbing party members or league members in a certain place, or that a special envoy of a certain party is actively working in a certain place. Whoever is willing to join the party or the league, needless to say, "hits the mark" and is happy to be appointed. This really can't help but make people think of the scene of issuing a notice to recruit "talents" in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties: the so-called "recluses in the mountains and forests", all of a sudden, like tigers and wolves, hungry and thirsty, came out of the mountains one after another, as if they had to do a great career. Whether this great career is for the country and the people will be discussed after the facts are revealed, but it is inevitable to be for oneself. Anyone who has read the history of the Ming Dynasty will understand. A satirical poem has already illuminated the five internal organs and six fu organs! "The sage dynasty specially ordered to test the virtuous, a team of Yi Qi descended from Shouyang, arranged new sparrow hats at home, prepared old articles in their belly, deeply ashamed of Zhou millet in those years, today they think of eating national grain, it is not a sudden change, the bracken on Xishan is eaten up!" The most terrible thing is probably that after eating up the bracken on Xishan, they still want to drink coffee and go to the dance hall. Some time ago, Yang Xiaoquan (also known as Xiaocun), a member of the Central Executive Committee of a certain party and a special envoy of the party affairs stationed in Shanghai, who was expelled from the party, wasn't he a living example? In addition to wanting to eat national grain, he also stepped into Jinghua, Atlantic, and other major restaurants, and also entered Lido, Xianle, and other dance halls. Not only that, he also pretended to be an old friend of a certain director of the police branch, signed blank checks, and defrauded more than ten million yuan! This "special envoy" failed to achieve great things and eventually went to jail, eating prisoner grain. Naturally, from the point of view of eliminating harm for the people, it is really a blessing in disguise. However, in this chaotic world, slick youths and frustrated politicians who attempt to eat national grain and eventually eat prisoner grain are not limited to Yang Xiaoquan alone. How can we prevent it from happening?</h3>
<h3>Reorganization of the Municipal Government Orchestra—Soon We Can Hear Them Play, Ni Qiuping: The Shanghai Municipal Government Orchestra has recently been taken over and presided over by Mr. Dai Cuilun. Mr. Dai is a violinist who has followed Huberman, the first-class violinist in Europe, for many years. He is now also the president of the Shanghai National Conservatory of Music, so Mr. Dai is the most ideal person to preside over this orchestra. After this reorganization of the Municipal Government Orchestra, Professor Fu Hua (Prof. A. Foa) served as the conductor. He is an outstanding graduate of the Milan Conservatory of Music. After graduating, he performed violin performances all over the European continent. He has been in Shanghai for more than 20 years. He was hired by the former Municipal Council Orchestra. At first, he served as the principal violinist, and later also served as the deputy conductor. His conducting skills are indeed superior to Maestro Mario Paci, although some people still think that he is not strong enough, but his conducting of complex and delicate music is also unmatched by others. The importance of the conductor is like the soul of a person, and now this orchestra has a new soul. In addition, there are three Chinese people in the orchestra who have joined as first violinists—Tan Shuzhen, Chen Youxin, and Mao Chuen. Mr. Tan was the first Chinese to join the Municipal Council Orchestra. Other Chinese people joined a long time after him. He is also proficient in violin making techniques. Mr. Chen co-founded the Shanghai Conservatory of Music with Ding Shande and has made many contributions to the music industry. This time they are already preparing, and soon we can hear the long-lost music again. Indeed, not long ago, the orchestra could not play the music that we could not hear because of the conductor. Now we can meet those music again, and I am afraid we will feel even more moving. Once, the Municipal Council Orchestra was one of the best orchestras in the Far East and the only one in China. It is a pity that there were few Chinese listeners. Since the victory and takeover, it has not been very smooth. I hope that this reorganization will lay the foundation for the future, hire famous foreign masters, and select domestic musicians. To develop music in China to a level above the standard line, the Shanghai Municipal Government Orchestra has a major mission. At the same time, everyone needs to appreciate it and cultivate this artistic flower.</h3>
<h3>Terrible Numbers, Liu Meng: According to the statistics department of the Jianghai Customs Tax Department, the import surplus for the past year was 189.054.35 billion yuan. Everyone "knows" what the "import surplus" means; as for this number, no matter how low the current currency value is, it is not enough to describe it with words like "quite amazing" and "quite huge". This is simply a terrible number. There may be the value of cosmetics and luxury goods in this number. Of course, it is necessary to endure the pain to accept the "import surplus" that is really used to revitalize the country. It is really painful to accept the unnecessary "import surplus", so why bother? According to the report of Mr. Niu Ruowang, a representative of a newspaper from the delegation to Japan, there are not many foreign goods on the Japanese market, and few people ask about them. A defeated and controlled country has such a situation. Compared with our number of more than one trillion, what kind of feelings will we have? Is the purchasing power of Japanese people far inferior to ours? However, "what equipment" and "what equipment" have long been popular among us, so what else can be said? If the number of more than one trillion continues to increase, no matter how many foreign loans there are, our China will still be poor, and perhaps it will get worse.</h3>
<h3>The Death of Cao Duanfang—Three of the Luxurious Officials in the Late Qing Dynasty, Aiju: Duan was transferred from Nanyang to Beiyang, and he was about to enter the central government, but he knew that the sun in the middle would decline, and the moon would be full and missing. Li Weihou's impeachment of less than 201 characters was based on disrespect, and the iceberg collapsed suddenly, and he resigned from office. Gai Liang Palace Shangbin, the coffin was parked on the main road, Duan dared to leave people living on the tree and photographed it. It can be said that the sky took away his soul and he was presumptuous. And the Nine Gates Admiral did not dare to stop it, his money was so strong. After being dismissed, he lived in Banmu Garden, the so-called Banmu Garden, which is the former residence of the owner of Hongxue Yinyuan. There is a small garden, and it is not impossible to live a leisurely old age. If Duan is enthusiastic and extravagant, he must go out again. He tried his best to dredge the current axis, and was able to re-enter the political arena due to the Sichuan Road unrest, and was killed by the mob. Even his brother Duan Liu died together. Alas, it is also miserable! Is it not the end of greed and extravagance—as for what he collected, in addition to the huge traces and famous products that people know, there are also many fakes. Li Huchen was the one who checked his books. He asked Li for all the Han steles such as the Huashan Ritual Vessels, and he was able to touch them on the desk. And Duan also boasted about his collection every night. After dinner, he arranged the ritual vessels and scrolls. The ones hung in the Yingtang Study Room were like the Four Wangs, then the walls were full of the Four Wangs, and so were the others. How could there not be a mixture of truth and falsehood. His human nature likes to abuse and joke, and he always makes people uncomfortable, but he has never played pranks on me and Tao Zhuocun. His extravagance in food and drink is not too much, but a donkey soup in winter is made by the kitchen himself, which is too cruel. Yu and Zhuocun can't bear to start it. Wei Hou's fold is also an imitation of He Ting's handwriting. One or two people have been abused and joked by Duan, and the resentment is very great! Mao Shang has two poems, which are also inscribed on the wall of Guangheju, which is a true poem history. Yu Ji's couplet says: "It should also be Zhu Chen through marriage, originally Yun Gui is a fellow villager." Zhu refers to the son of Zhu Jingsi, who is the godson of the important person, and Chen is a certain governor. The ending of another song is good, which is a parasitic grass to a parasitic flower. In recent times, there is a drama called Nepotism. All those who have nepotism are close to it, and they also have a little shame.</h3>
<h3>Coal Mine Monster—Looking at the So-Called Will to Live, Liucheng: I saw a strange piece of news: In a certain coal mine in Sichuan, a coal miner dug up a monster in the mine. It was covered with very long hair, and only bones were left on its body. There was no meat at all, and it was making a whirring sound in its mouth. The miner was initially startled, and then gathered other workers to move the monster outside the mine. He discovered that the monster was originally a human. He speculated that he was also a miner, who was buried underground when a coal mine collapsed. But he did not die. He lived by eating coal. When he was moved outside the mine, he was no longer able to adapt to the new environment and died immediately. This story is sad enough. I thought of how strong human beings' will to survive is, and how persistent their attachment to life is! A country, a society, and a person are all fighting for survival.</h3>
<h3>Literary and Art World: Zang Kejia's first collection of short stories, "Hanging Red", will be printed and published by Dushu Publishing House. It contains eleven short stories, totaling 120,000 words. It is said that it will be published in May. After "Green Northern Country", Fan Quan will have his first collection of essays published. The title of the book is "Noguchi Kisaburo". Most of the contents are sketches of Japanese military police and civilians during the fall. The materials and writing methods are very unique. The "Women's Heart" trilogy, which was previously translated by Shi Diancun, has recently been printed and published in a new edition by Shenzhou Guoguang Publishing House, with a total of 500 pages. However, when the new edition was printed, the publisher forgot the sub-titles of the trilogy, which can be said to be "a fly in the ointment". Tian Han is currently in Wuxi, living on Dahe Shang Street. He will return to Shanghai within the next two days to prepare to finish writing all the sequel to the script "Pipa Xing", which is serialized in "Literary Spring and Autumn". The Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily may open a purely literary and artistic supplement, which is said to be in active planning.</h3>
<h3>You are You, Feng: Master Taixu took a photo after sitting in Guanyu at Putuo Xilin Temple in 1934, with long hair and a long beard. He titled it himself: "You, you, I know you, I know you, you are you." Bai Taixu wrote the title below, which is quite philosophical.</h3>
<h3>"Happy Reward", Mao Jingchu: He was concentrating on an oil painting titled "Spring". All that could be seen was a graceful girl, covering only a few key points of her jade body with a few leaves. Suddenly, his wife shouted sharply: "Hey, what are you waiting for?—Waiting for autumn?"</h3>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Crisis, Qin Shouou: Lao Xu was really flustered. His wife was not at home; he brought a girl in, wasn't this a capital crime? And the most wronged thing was that Jin Aili, under the guidance of Lao Zhu, declared when she moved in that she must live in the same room with Mrs. Hu; and this Mrs. Hu was also really strange, as if she had colluded with Lao Zhu, and had been messing around inside, taking Jin Aili in and out, simply not letting Lao Xu have a chance to touch her. "Didn't you persuade her to stay in Liuzhou for a while?" Fatty Xu also knew the extent of Xiao Shen's familiarity with his wife, so he asked with a kind of hope. "She was originally going to come with me." Xiao Shen told him honestly: "Unfortunately, the driver's seat of the Jiaotong Bank car I took was already occupied by two people. She is not used to sitting in the back, so she temporarily changed her mind and planned to take the Yaxi Bank car tomorrow." "Are our six cars all in Liuzhou?" The most concerned about by Xie is his six trucks; on these six trucks, he pinned his hopes for a happy life in the second half of his life. He was prepared to throw away the small gauze hat. "They are all there. Two of them have already been unloaded, but," Xiao Shen gave him a gloating smile. "But two newspapers are scolding your China Tea Company, and they also said that someone is investigating you for losing tea leaves and not transporting them, but instead contracting commercial goods." "Let them say it, anyway, it is a fact that the car cannot be driven</h3>
<h3>Agreement Reached on Governance Plan; National Government Committee to be Reorganized Soon; Representatives from Various Parties Conferring in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 22nd] The proposal for the post-reorganization government's governance policies put forward by the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party was agreed upon on the 22nd at a review meeting held by the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and prominent social figures, totaling fourteen articles.

(2) The troop reduction plan should be earnestly implemented after the military actions end. (3) A system of the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan should be trialed. (4) During the transitional period, the selection of the president of the Executive Yuan should solicit the agreement of all parties. (5) The legal system of the tutelage period should be thoroughly reformed. (6) The tutelage organs should be completely abolished. (7) Tax revenues should be consolidated. (8) Human rights should be protected. (9) All friendly nations should be treated with amity. (10) Foreign loans should be used for productive enterprises.

<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 22nd] It is heard that the government's counter-proposal to the Youth Party and Democratic Socialist Party's proposal to participate in the government still needs to be submitted to the Chairman for approval. The next step after the announcement of the plan discussed by all parties will be to begin the reorganization of the National Government Committee. All parties will discuss the implementation procedures and personnel selection. The preparation for the reorganization of the government is about to reach a mature stage.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 22nd] During the eighth plenary session of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, when discussing the preparation plan for the implementation of the Constitution (the report after review and revision by the political group), Committee Member Pan Gongzhan spoke, saying: "Since this plan specifies that the political measures of our party in the future should focus on expanding the government's foundation as quickly as possible and preparing for the implementation of the Constitution, it is naturally of concern to all comrades at this plenary session. Before the discussion, the government representatives responsible for discussing the reorganization of the government with the various parties should be asked to report to the plenary session on the recent consultations, so as to understand the truth. As it is now twelve o'clock, the meeting will continue in the afternoon, with Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng and Committee Member Lei Zhen reporting on the process one after another. Committee Member Huang Yuren, Committee Member Gu Zhenggang, and others all expressed their opinions. Subsequently, the plenary session resolved to authorize the Central Standing Committee to be responsible for deciding on the issue of the government's consultations with the various parties."</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 22nd] The main points of the preparation plan for the implementation of the Constitution are as follows: (1) From the promulgation of the Constitution to the date of convocation, the political measures of the party should focus on expanding the government's foundation as quickly as possible and preparing for the implementation of the Constitution. (2) Full support should be given to the measures taken by the expanded National Government in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. (3) Cooperation should be carried out with other political parties to jointly complete the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution. (4) The government should promptly revise or abolish any regulations that conflict with the constitutional provisions guaranteeing the people's freedom.
