<h3>開明外交政策的重申</h3>
<p>在國際局勢動盪不安的今日，特別是四强外長會議召開淤莫斯科，蘇聯外長提出討論中國局勢之緊張局勢漸平而餘霾未消之際，我們歡迎王外交部長對三中全會所作的報吿。在這個時候，全國人民都希望我們的外交當局能够對當前的國際局勢及我們的外交政策有所闡明，如今王外交部長對三中全會所作的報吿，至少已部分的可以慰全國人民之望。此一報吿，據報傳消息，可以分作兩個部分，其一爲王外交部長向三中全會所提的書面報吿，其另一部爲王外交部長於十六日在三中全會席上所作的口頭報吿。據新聞社的報導，是項口頭報告，僅爲王外交部長向三中全會所提書面報告之補充。此一書面報吿，現在旣未公布，我們自無從知其內容；而報紙上所登載的王外交部長的口頭報吿，一鱗半爪，又未必是全文的眞相。但就依新聞報道來論，我們已可窺見我們的外交政策之一個明晰的輪廓。從新聞社所傳來以及報紙上所刋載的王外交部長在三中全食所作的外交口頭報吿，已不難使我們明瞭當今政府所抱的外交歡策。</p>
<p>王外交部長在三中全會所作的這一篇口頭外交報吿，率直坦白，充分表現了我們信愛和平的立國精神。據報載消息，王外交部長所闡明的我國外交政策，簡括言之，「卽擁護及支持聯合國機構，對美保持傳統友誼，對蘇嚴格實行中蘇條約，對日不採取報復，而求軍事方面充分保證，不使其再事侵略。」在此寥寥數語之中，我國外交政策的主要部分已闡述無遺：我們的講求信愛以及中正和平的立國之道，於此可見。從世界和平的觀點來論，一個堅强的國際組織實爲必要。國際組織的柔弱無力是導成此次世界大戰的一個主要因素。茲當長期流血干戈息止之會，我們不願見戰禍的再起，允須盡共可能扶持聯合國這一國際組織的發育；必此一機構具有權能，則人類方能免於再度戰爭的厄運。王外交部長的口頭外交報吿，開宗明義，首先就提到擁護及支持聯合國機構，允可見我們對重建世界持久和平所取途徑的正當。我們當還不會忘記九一八事變以後，國際聯盟對處理我國的東北事件之柔弱無力，終於引起蘆溝橋事件，而引起我國的全面抗戰，以至世界第二次大戰的爆發，受了這慘痛經騐的敎調，我們對於擁護及支持一個强有力的聯合國機構的發育，允有切身之感。因此，我們覺得王外交部長所提到的如限制否決權的使用，以及爲了維持世界和平而有聯合國機構安全武裝部隊的設置，實在有其必要。</p>
<p>講到對美關係，中美兩國隔太平洋相望，立國理想，多少又復相同：中美問原有傳統的睦誼。此一傳統睦誼，又因太平洋戰爭的爆發，經過了血的洗禮而益凝固。中美兩國人民間彼此關注之深，相愛之切，本不待言。我們覺得遺憾的是晚近曾有少數人民，別有作用，在中國掀起了所謂反美運動。此一運動的別具作用，不能謂爲中國人民自發的運動，更木能據以代表中國人民一般的意向，本報曾屢爲文加以闡述。如今我外交部長旣將我對美關係的政策加以闡明，歸納到「對美保持傳統友誼」八個大字，我們站在民間的立塲，更願加以補充，就是：我們不但要一對美保持傳統友誼」，更希望由「保持」而「增進」，使此後中美的傳統友誼，能够益趨凝固。</p>
<p>至於講到我們的對蘇關係，中蘇地壤相接，其間國界的綿長，世無其匹。我們珍視蘇聯的睦誼；因此，我們不惜放棄部分的主權，簽訂了中蘇條約。此一條約旣經簽訂，我們固有信守的義務，另一締的方也有忠實履行的義務。王外交部長所設的「對蘇嚴格實行中蘇條約」，此爲我們講求國際信義的一種表示，爲全國人民所一致擁戴。中國人民將國內的共產黨問題與國外的對蘇關係判爲兩事。中國的共產黨問題是一個國內問題，對於處理這一問題的態度，並不牽涉到對蘇關係的態度。對於蘇聯致力於建國的努力，及其對希特勒的英勇作戰，是中國人民所欽仰的。我們珍視我們偉大的鄰邦的睦誼，我們願此後兩國的關係旣築基在中蘇條約的新關係上，能够更滋長發育起來。</p>
<p>對於日本的不採取報復主義，又是我們以仁愛爲本的立國精神之崇高的表視。這政策是得到全國人民一致支持的。我們於此有不能不一提的，就是對於亞洲其它各民族的態度；此在王外交部長的報吿裏，或不曾提及，但我們覺得這實是我國對外政策最主要的一部。中國與印度暹羅等國旣已互換大使，又興菲列賓，波期，阿富汗等國建立外交關係，派駐使節：此外亞洲的共它民族亦已有向獨立自主的方向行進；其中緬甸的獨立，不久且可見諸事實。所以我們對於亞洲各民族的政策，實有亟須闡明的必要。朝鮮與我們的國土，隔鴨綠江相望，對於它的福利，我們自然尤為關切；如何能够使朝鮮人爲的宰割，趨於消滅，重見統一，我們與朝鮮誼同手足，豈可不加努力？復次印度旣有所謂泛亞會議的召開，此雖爲一種民間的集合，也似乎多少是一種「外交攻勢」。我們以亞洲國家而爲聯合國機構安全理事會的鴛任理事，允具有代表並領導亞洲各民族的意義。我們顧外交當局能更就此點，繼績有所闡明，要亦足以一新世人耳目。</p>

<h3>麥帥主張扶植日本　強調對日和約應早日締訂　俾迅速結束武力佔領工作</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京十七日電〕麥帥今日向記者團發表重要談話稱：對日和約簽訂後，不可繼續以武力統制日本，總部應立即撤銷。揆之目前世界形勢，開始商討和約之日，業已成熟。和約發定後，和約所定諸條件，應由聯合國監督履行。聯合國之存在理由，亦即在此。聯合國在戰後世界中，如不能領導日本，其機構即無意義可言。聯合國刻正面臨重要經濟問題，日本之生產必須提高至足以維持日人最低生活之程度，日本必須重建爲從事輸出入貿易之商業國家，日本在戰後劃定之國境內，殊不足以滿足民國所需糧食。日本之耕地，其單位面積生產力，居世界第一，然殊不足以贍養戰後邁處狹小國土內之數千萬人民。故吾人必須准許日本從事對外貿易，而此項貿易須任由民間為之，而將政府之統制抑至最低限度。有人以為日本應在經濟上孤立五十年，此種意見，殊屬非是。關於賠償問題，日本既喪失「滿洲」，朝鮮，及台灣，已付代價至鉅，日本在此等地方所投資，無慮數十億，向由此等地方輸入所需糧食。關於與日本媾和一事，聯合國間意見尚未一致，殊屬不幸。日本既廢除軍隊，放棄戰爭，殊堪嘉尚。日本目前經濟情形，已因戰爭而陷於極端疲弊，倘一味繼續維持經濟封鎖，將加重美國之負担，蓋目前能向日本供給所需糧食者，美國一國而已。爲重建輸出貿易，日本紡織業必須立即擴充，棉花須由美國，羊毛衫須由澳洲輸入。日本之賠償及貿易之統制，須有若干伸縮性，蓋賠償之目的，在於摧毀日本之戰爭能力，而非摧毀日本之生存能力也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京十七日電〕麥帥主張早日締結對日和約，並謂：和約成立之後，盟國者不應再有軍隊駐在日本，否則和約將毫無用處可言。有詢以美國將否以借款貸予日本，麥帥答曰，日本不但有付貸的能力，且亦急於還債。以言其軍事與政治局勢，解除軍備一項工作，今已在物質與精神上完成，其作戰潛力亦已全部毀滅，並已得到作戰得不償失之教訓，此誠可謂爲世界上最偉大之革命精神。同時日本之舊式神話及封建傳統亦已消失，傾向於個人自由，余作此言，並非民主政治業已完成之謂，要治民主政治須求其逐步發展，始能實現云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十七日電〕麥帥稱：美國借予日本之信用貸款，日本應在和約成立之後立即開始償付，以後再有對日之借款，應以私人名義貸予私人企業公司，俾復興日本之私人經濟制度。</p>
<h3>外長會議進入第二週　經濟爲討論中心　美擬就德臨時政府計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十七日電〕四國外次會議繼續在僵持狀態中，討論對德和約之程序，與德奧和約中之軍事問題。兩小組會議由美國之墨飛與克拉克分任主席。外長會議亦定於下午四時集會，屆時馬歇爾將提出其德國經濟統一與建立臨時德國政府之計劃。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十七日電〕美國代表團業已根據經濟統一計劃，完成一項產生德國臨時政府之詳細計劃，於今日提交四外長會議。該項計劃說明美國不信如無一德國中央政權出現，德國經濟統一即能獲一致充分自給之基礎。就美國務鄉馬歇爾之點言，渠預想中之觀德國臨時政府，乃根據於各德國聯邦之地方政府而產生云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：莫斯科外長會議美國代表團中頗多軍界人物，加以杜魯門籲請對希土援助之演說，使蘇聯當局感覺美國姿態之堅強。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十七日電〕外長會議議程若無突然變更，則四外長於會議之第二週初，將開始討論盟管會關於經濟原則之報告。一般咸認報告書之此一部份，乃最重要亦最繁複之一章，內容計分十一項，乃：（一）工業水準；（二）戰爭工業動力之清理；（三）糧食配給；（四）農業；（五）托辣斯之解散；（六）輸入及輸出；（七）國內貿易；（八）經濟統一；（九）運輸；（十）財政銀行及金融改革；（十一）德國及盟國財產之轉移。全局關鍵當然在於第八項之經濟統一問題。四強能就此點成立協議，則四強在德行動之一致，可以簡化不少。英貝文外相已明白指出實行波泆坦協定關於德國部份之決議，當視經濟統一是否能實現而定，經濟不統一則政治統一亦僅幻想而已，四強目前雖均擁護經濟統一之原則，然施策各異，難以互相契合，預料英國所將提出之先決條件，即為准許各區物資之無限制自由交流，不然經濟統一決不能完遂其宗旨。</p>
<h3>面臨難關　成敗關鍵</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十六日電〕各國代表團預料下星期將為會議最緊急階級，經濟統一與賠償問題被認為德國問題之難關。以上兩問題與德國局勢之每一其他部份互相關連。此等問題如能成立協議，則其他問題即屬次要，而易迎刃而解，否則其他問題亦無從解決。據某主要代表稱，關於德國賠償與經濟統一問題，下星期難望成立協議，但在經濟談判結束時，即可發現此次會議有無成立妥協之機會。於是否人再可費一星期或一星期以上之時間獲致共同原則。此一星期結束時，倘陷於僵局，則就德國問題而論，吾人可以賦婦，至少在本屆會議如此。</p>

<h3>蘇聯反對土國　參加和約協商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十七日廣播：在今日外次會議中，蘇聯第一次答復杜魯門總統籲請援助希土兩國之演詞。先是美代表建議准許土耳其·墨西哥·菲列濱·及伊朗參加對德和約諮詢委員會，蘇外長維辛斯蕊立即猛烈予以反對，謂土耳其在此次大戰中，始終採取騎墻主義，直至一九四四年三月一日方對德宣戰，維辛斯蕊並引證華萊士之演詞，謂土耳其已自此次戰爭中坐享其利。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十七日電〕英代表史屈朗今日向四外長代表會議提議，准許全體盟國參加對德問題之四個常設委員會，此項委會可以包括廿二個委員。設立委員會之議，係法國最先提出，目的在討論（一）德國之政治機構；（二）領土問題；（三）經濟問題；（四）裁軍問題，蘇代表維辛斯蕊則反對英國提議，認為四強應負和約責任。</p>
<h3>美駐希土大使　奉詔返國述職　援助希土法案正式提交衆院</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕此間人士預料美國駐土大使咸爾遜與美駐希臘經濟代表團領袖波特現均已回國述職。抵達華府後，當先與杜魯門總統進行會談，然後出席衆院外交委員會議，討論援助希土二國一項法案。至衆院加以辯論之日期，則當俟委員會提出之後，幷需視其意見如何，再行定期開會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕國務院法律專家與衆院外交委員會已完成實施杜魯門總統援助希土之新中東政策之立法章案。衆院外交委員會主席伊頓將於十七日將該案提付討論。該委員會委員門達特將提出修正案，限制除希土之軍事訓練與顧問團外，決不能以任何理由派遣軍事人員。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播：據美陸軍部方面人士談稱，德境美佔領區內之美軍政府當局將協力建設希臘，以配合美國援希計劃。陸軍官員中富有建築鐵路公路及發電所之經騐者，將担任此項工程，同時並將起用美政府各部門之專家。據稱，現駐於義大利之八十八師，可能派遣軍事代表團前往希臘，訓練希人使用美國軍器。戰時遺留之大批美國軍火，現仍留存於義國。在國會未曾批准杜魯門之援希要求以前，陸軍部對美國準備派往希臘之軍隊實力及番號，繼續保持緘默。</p>
<p>英閣昨檢討　杜魯門演說</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十六日電〕英閣將於　明日召開會議，討論杜魯門援助希土二國之演說，及其對於英國將來外交政策之影響，但不致即獲商定決議，僅爲檢討此項演說所引起之反應而已英閣或將等候外相貝文，提出外長會議第一週之報告及蘇聯之反應，然後始能決定舉措云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：今日下院開會時，工黨左翼議員猛烈抨擊杜魯門總統之援助希土政策，據謂杜魯門此舉不特侵略歐洲東南部，且已侵犯聯合國之權力。</p>
<h3>莫斯科電台　抨擊杜魯門</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十六日電〕莫斯科電台之英語評述員「分析家」稱：杜魯門援助希土之宣言。爲對於東南歐諸國敵意的表示，希臘及土耳其現在反動政府統治中，對曾經抗德之人濫施壓迫。杜魯門欲以美國金圓，供給該兩政府，俾得添辦武器，以壓制國內，準備侵略國外。證諸捷克斯拉夫聲請復興貸款被美所拒一點，杜魯門之用意，不言可喻矣。</p>
<h3>傳美擬以鉅欵貸蘇　促其改變擴張政策　不然美將擴大對東歐援助</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十六日電〕此間報章根據華盛頓消息稱：倘蘇聯能改變其擴張勢力之政策，則美國或將貸予鉅額借款。倘克倫姆林寓加以拒絕，則美國將擴大其援助政策，遍及東歐各國，尤其是對於匈牙利，以防止蘇聯伸張其勢力。並傳美國將派遣艦隊至地中海，以表現美國之實力。據英報外交訪員稱：英國務卿馬歇爾對此或將設法與史達林本人或莫洛托夫，進行會談。聞馬歇爾贊成土希義三國締結聯盟條約，此即美國將予以財政援助之請，倘在必要時，或將使三國武裝，以抵禦侵略。另悉：美國亦在考慮以六億借款貸予朝鮮一事。</p>
<h3>羅夫人談民生</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社洛杉磯十七日電〕羅斯福總統夫人昨夜向報界談稱：伊贊成美國援助希臘，但以不受政治約束爲限。夫人認為只要美國人民安居樂業，共產主義即不能破壞美國民主，蓋共產主義產生於災難與貧窮故也。</p>
<h3>威爾斯指責　蘇擴張政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕前美副國務鄉威爾斯，乃一聯合國之熱誠擁護者，今日在其每週廣播中宣稱：「聯合國組織現尚不擬作阻止蘇聯帝國主義在中東發展之準備。摧毀聯合國及造成美蘇間戰爭之必然途徑，乃爲美國因循自誤，任令蘇聯對西歐，地中海，及中歐之控制勢力，迅速擴張。」威爾斯又稱：如將此一問題提交聯合國解決，在安全理事會中雖經過若干時期之折動，美蘇之間，恐仍無獲得協議之機會也。</p>
<h3>阿拉斯加　蘇聯矚目</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕共和黨衆議員蓋亞哈特今日告記者稱：蘇聯方矚目於阿拉斯加。蘇聯現望一八六七年　國自沙皇政府購置阿拉斯加一舉爲不合法，國務院應說明蘇聯是否擬設法收回此富裕之「戰略要區」。明日渠將以此問題向衆院提出，因其與杜魯門總統計劃利用金錢物資人力援助希臘土耳其防制共產主義之擴張，頗有關係。</p>
<h3>美共黨提申訴</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十七日電〕頃悉：美國共產黨之憲法上的權利遭限制及國會擬取締共產黨後，該黨已致電現在莫斯科之馬歇爾國務卿，表示抗議，謂此舉與馬卿最近在莫斯科發表之民主原則不符云。</p>

<h3>安理會討論三要案　蘇態度極堪注目　美反對託管計劃任何修正案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十六日電〕美國勢力決定踏進巴爾幹半島後，各方注意現集中於蘇聯代表葛羅米柯，欲藉以窺見蘇聯在聯合國機構內所采取之政策，今後數日間，葛氏有三大發言機會，足以表明蘇聯之新立場。十七日安理會將繼續辯論太平洋託管島問題，十九日原子能委員會將重新討論國際管制報告，由葛羅米柯担任主席。此外，安理會或將在十八日開會討論英國控訴阿爾巴尼亞敷設水雷一案之報告書。觀察家認為上述諸端雖在巴爾幹問題範圍以外，但際茲多事之秋，蘇聯決不猶豫於闡述其政策所在。例如莫斯科外長會議本為討論德國問題而召集者，但第一次會議中蘇聯即已提出中國問題，觀乎莫斯科政府報紙之態度，尚難得預斷葛氏是否將對美國不經由聯合國機構　行援助希臘土耳其一節有所譴責。十七日安理會在杜魯門總統發表演說以後尚屬初次舉行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十六日電〕美官方發言人稱：美在十七日安理會恢復辯論美國單獨托管太平洋舊日本島嶼計劃時，將拒絕英國與澳洲之三項修正案。美國並準備反抗紐西蘭，印度，菲律濱或荷蘭所提之最後修正案，按此四國或將於十七日安理會中獲得暫時席位，以評述托管協定。美代表奧斯汀聲稱，此計劃之最後批准，因英國及其自治領之不忍耐及要求「門戶開放」政策，致拖延不決。奧氏稱，渠希望此計劃能在本週末前獲得批准。</p>

<h3>西班牙醞釀復辟　保王黨領袖擬與唐璜會商</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞社馬德里十六日電〕西班牙保王黨領袖若干人，包括亞爾巴公爵，將前往里斯本，與西班牙王位繼任人唐璜舉行會議。此間保王黨人士對於此項行將舉行之會議，咸極重視，以視去年之會議尤甚，但對於西班牙恢復君主政體之方法，則所見各有不同。若干人士反對與弗朗哥將軍舉行談判，另有若干人士則不願與左派團體聯緊，此在西班牙政府人士，則對於保王黨之恢復君主政體計劃，均不表關切云。</p>
<h3>聖地戒嚴令撤銷　惟恐怖份子仍極活躍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：自英陸軍實行軍事控制巴勒斯坦，以防止猶太地下工作人員暴動以來，迄今十五日，茲因秩序已告恢復，巴勒斯坦政府特自本日起取消戒嚴令。按自戒嚴令頒佈後，約有猶人二十五萬被阻於耶路撒冷一隅及沿海地帶，在戒嚴令撤銷前數小時，猶太人數萬咸喜形於色，塵集於鐵絲鋼側，等待開放。</p>

<h3>甘地呼籲和平　不惜以死力爭</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里十六日電〕甘地現在去年十一月大暴動區之比哈爾省，研究勸導和平之方針，渠於昨日晤比省總督，該省政府已令報紙刊載甘地之呼籲及禱告辭，勸告回印兩族言和。</p>
<p>〔合衆社孟買十六日電〕據接近甘地之人士談稱，甘地或將犧牲生命，作為結束印度不斷暴動之最後努力。甘地之態度已由惶惑及困惱趨向於「四大皆空」之境地。過去即使在最困擾之境況中，甘地亦能鎮靜自持，且屢稱自借力之消失乃弱者之表示。但最近本哲布省之暴動，及貝哈爾省回教領袖之態度，使聖雄失去其自信力。甘地於最近一次演說中曾謂，渠不願茍生世上，目睹其「不暴動主義」之失敗云。</p>

<h3>中央公司試航機奉令改期飛西貢</h3>
<p>中央航空公司爲開關中法聯航綫及中　航綫，原定本月十九日派專機一架由滬飛往西貢曼谷兩地試航，茲因出國手續尙未完全辦妥，中央公司昨接交通部電令，延暹一星期試航，該公司已遵令改遲至本月廿六日起飛。此行任務全係試航，故不載客貨，僅有急須去退羅之我國外交人員附載往曼谷。</p>

<h3>公用事業是否漲價　看中央貼補程度始能作最後決定</h3>
<p>本市公用事業沸價問題，業經醖釀月餘，然當局認爲事關市民福利，未可輕易決定，遂成懸案。惟據記者向各公用事業部門調查結果，悉每月　蝕之總數，遠七百六十億元之鉅。又據各有關方面表示：公用事業漲價與否或漲價成數，尙有待中央決定貼補數多寡及是否係貼補燃委會抑或貼補各公用事業，方可決定。因若能全部貼補，則不加價，如僅能貼補一部份，則看貼補數多少而決定加價成數。若　燃料委員會之煤斤仍以十四萬五千元一噸配售各公用事業部門，則當貼予燃料委員會。若煤斤照三月份新價二十一萬元配售各公用事業，則應貼予公用事業各單位。究竟若何，有待經濟部王部長日內晋京與中央統盤籌劃後，再作最後決定云。</p>
<h3>浦東楊思橋鎭附近　警隊遇匪雙方格鬥　羣匪携有快慢機槍終被擊退</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前晚九時許，浦東楊思橋鎭附近曾發生警匪開槍格鬥案，雙方相持至昨晨二時，匪徒始不支竄去。當時情勢極度緊張，匪徒人數約七餘名，携有快慢機，火力相當猛烈，終以駐於該鎭之保安警察大隊及楊思橋警分局南街派出所全體官警奮力截擊，將其擊退。緣當前晚九時，該鎭南街警局派出所所長黃淡循例會同保警大隊長洪亮率領員警一小隊，至四郊巡邏，詎至區公所後恒大紗廠附近小路時，黑暗中隱約見前面人影幢幢，當即喝令止步，擬加檢查，詎匪徒即向警方開槍，此時洪隊長爲自衛計，即下令隊員四散還擊，一面由黃所長返所急調大隊警員及保警大隊全體官兵馳往增援，至十二時匪徒不支退去，惟相隔不久，至昨晨一時半，匪徒復捲土重來，企圖衝入街鎭，終因不敵警方火力，至二時後始全部竄去。該案昨已由該分局呈報警察總局，同時已對匪徒退却方面　日實施搜查。並悉此次格鬥，　方均無死傷。</p>
<h3>孫華明傷人致死　上訴審結　辯稱純係敵人虐待無衣無食凍餧而死</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨日下午審理一傷人致死之上訴案，其中牽涉敵人於戰爭期間，招募華工至北每道開機，無衣無食，因凍餧而死大罪行之一。隊有孫華明者，被控曾充任日本北海道輪西製鐵所鏟煤工人第一隊第三班班長，在其屬下有工人林阿祥·韋民·李經·許光德·袁良弟·陸雲·郭再坡。彭永根·趙元英等九人，被孫以鐵棍毆打，傷重致死。迨日寇投降，另有同伴屠玉堂，回國吿知被害人林阿祥之父林春霖，得悉前情，吿由上海市警察局楊樹浦分局將孫拘解地院，經地院以連續使人受重傷面致人於死，處無期徒刑，褫奪公權終身，孫奉判不服，上訴高院。昨孫出庭時辯稱，班長並無打人之權，只有東洋人隨便打人，北海道天氣冷，冬天雪深數尺，東洋人只規定我們每天吃六兩米，因病不能做工的只有三兩，裏面還　雜豆餅，豆渣，蘿蔔等物，不發棉衣，不發工錢，以致凍死餓死的很多，其他班裏也有人死去，實在不是我把他們打死的。嗣由兩同船回國之華工到庭證明，每一百人中平均有六七十人之死亡率，純係由於敵人虐待，孫並無過失。末由檢察官暨辯護律師辯論後，庭論審理終結，定二十四日下午三時宣判。</p>

<h3>市參議會內將設圖書館</h3>

<h3>前法租界區租值重估事延期再議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕房捐之征收，係根據租値，最近前法租界區居民向財政局要求將租値重審者甚多，而該局亦因前法租界區租値之審估與前公共租界區有別，爲求統一起見，擬將該區之租値重行審估。該案曾提前次市政會議討論，因重行審佔時，其調查等所需費用支出浩大，故討論未有結果，延期再作定論。</p>
<h3>擅捕人民決予制止　宣司令再三表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳本市日來常有人民被捕失蹤之事，淞滬警備司令部已一再聲明，該部除依據法律手續簽發拘票及搜索票者外，絕無秘密拘捕人民或搜紫住宅等情。昨日宣司令又在該部紀念週上再度提出，謂自中共人員撤退後，秘密工作者固大有其人，但假借警備司令部名義擅自拘捕人民及搜索住宅，實爲非法行動，應予制止。宣氏並稱，淞滬區內除警備部外，任何機關不得捕人，至少亦須與警備部取得聯絡。今後對於其他機關擅自拘人，決予注意，作有效之制止云。</p>
<h3>中信局鄭重聲明　進口未享特權　輸入奢侈品說無稽</h3>
<p>〔中央社〕關於報載一統公司，中央信託局及中國供應局，現正將大量奢侈品購運進口各節，記者爲明瞭眞相起見，特走訪中央信託局負責人。據稱，本局爲政府購料機關，創始於民國二十三年，黃金由政府撥充，因在美國方面，該局並無分局，故在美一切購科事宜，概由華盛頓中國物資供應委員會，及紐約世界貿易公司代辦。本局一切進口均依照輸入臨時管理委員會章則辦理，申請　人許可手續，並未享受特殊權利。本局茲特鄭重否認合衆社發表之新聞中，所稱本局有輸入奢侈品如無綫電機及冰箱情事。此點可向海關證實。該新聞中並稱，傳有一部份奢侈品已由政府機關職員轉售牟利，允屬無稽。又當戰事結束之時，輸入限額制度尙未成立之前，本局爲應各機關之急需，訂購汽車一批一百九十輛。該項汽車之分配，完全秉承行政院命令辦理，由本局按照成本交各政府機關購用，並未按市價出售，故無利潤可言云</p>
<h3>公共車輛不敷一倍　私人機動車等數量激增登記手續深感應付困難　市公用局第四處長報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據公用局第四處處長李蔭松，昨在市府紀念週中報告：戰前本市各商營公共交通綫合計六十五綫，車輛七四五輛，（包括公共汽車，有無軌電車）。勝利後雖經積極恢復，然截至目前止，仍較戰前減少三分之一，而本市人口則已由三百餘萬增至四百餘萬，此爲交通困難及擁塞之基木原因。據交通專家估計，以本市人口四百萬計，平均每日可能有百分之六十，即二百四十萬人離居出外，而大多數皆有賴於公共車輛，以每輛平均可供二千人乘坐計算，本市需有一千部公共東開方敷應用，而現在實際上僅有五百餘輛，故　擠自在意料之中。本局現已聘請美國專家來滬，研究本市交通問題，深信將來定有良好意見及辦法，可供採用。</p>
<p>敵僞車輛處理尤難</p>
<p>本市因人口激增，車輛亦相繼增加，私人機動車已較前增加一倍，計爲二萬二千餘輛。又戰後產生之三輪車，已達一萬八八餘輛，此外脚踏車，人力車等數量均有所增加，致公用局方面對於車輛登記問題，深感不敷應付。查戰前有公用局與英法兩租界當局三方面分別辦理，現則合併一處，且勝利後機動車自外埠及內地來滬者爲數甚多，其中處理最感困難者，則係敵僞性之車輛。</p>
<p>須有確證方准過戶</p>
<p>根據接收僞建設局之記錄，凡有敵僞名義，或敵軍由他處運來者，過去本市根本並無登記，按照行政　命令，凡敵僞車輛，在敵人屈服以前賣與善竟第三者，認爲有效，故審查時，極爲困難。接收時各方面紛紛駛車來局申請登記，而當時因記錄尙未接齊，故擬定臨時辦法，准其具保給照。一方面在於便利人民交通，一方面在於避免逃往其他區域，但此項車輛，必須待提供確切證件後，方准過戶。</p>
<p>駕駛執照發給一般</p>
<p>關於駕駛考騐事項，駕駛人申請考騐駕駛技術前，須先向警局捺蓋指印，及指定市立醫院檢查號格，考　合格後，方准發給。本市總計發給普通駛駕執照九，九〇八張，職業者一九，七八六張，學習者八，九五〇張，三輪車駕駛員駕駛執照二三，〇〇〇張，駕駛學校已經呈准有案者二二所。</p>
<h3>汪柱臣案三審地院傳訊證人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕汪柱臣應匿敵長島洋行遺留物資案，昨地院傳證三審，計到證人吳　　（警備司令部大隊長），俄人羅仁伯（奧多汽車公司經理），愛派拉司卡維基（奧多職員），普陀路警察分局前副分局長膝泳溪，及曾代汪藏匿贓物之告發人范　春（中央機廠廠長）。庭上首訊吳潤蓀，吳係汪案在淸查團偵查時之承辦入，據稱：汪柱臣被密吿後，彼即派人至汪處化裝偵查，冒充接洽購買汽車零件，汪曾開具淸單，罪證確實。現此淸　已移交於警備部交通科，可檢出作證。奧多汽車公司經理羅仁伯及其職員皆承認識汪，惟對於侵吞敵產罪行，稱未前聞。范蓉春稱：不識汪柱臣，汽車零件係由滕泳溪之介紹前來寄存，後由職員顧定一閱報發覺後報警。聞地院對該案極重親，下次或將組合議庭舉行辯論</p>

<p>尤別愆問　（一）某甲有屋七間，於卅三年以法幣一萬元抵押於乙，定期十年，押息作爲租金，旋收回二間另行押與他人。最近某甲擬將該項房屋全部絕　與乙，不果，改售與丙，但丙只要其中三間，並請某乙將押期改爲七年，乙以押期未滿當然不能同意，未知在法律上有何保障？（二）如該項房屋絕　與內，某乙所付之一萬押款，應如何處置？（三）丙受買甲屋，乙尙有七年住屋權利，如丙强欲遷入，應如何應付？（四）再有一屋，甲頂與乙，乙續租於丙，乙每月收丙之租金爲甲之頂息今甲直接賣於丙乙則不知，丙置屋後即拒付租金，當時卅一年頂費爲僞幣一萬，期十年。又甲又未滿期而　絕於丙，於理不合，如向其追償頂費，應以何種比例折算？</p>
<p>〔姜屏藩律師答〕（一）乙受押甲之住屋七間。復搬入屋內居住，以押款之息作爲房金，對於抵押物上又已取得租賃權，事後乙伺意甲之要求，將其中兩間重行抵押與他人，原爲法所許可。至甲又將該物全部出售於丙，其基於所有權行使出售，自然乙所能反對。惟乙已得之抵押租及賃仍權，並不因其所有權之移轉而受影饗，就行繼續存在，如丙對乙要求期間十年改爲七年，房屋五間改爲三間，如乙不同意，依法可以拒絕。（二）甲將房屋出售與丙，乙之抵押款項，可淸其賣得價金受淸償之權。（三）丙買受甲屋後，乙尙有七年之租期，當然司以繼續行使權利，如果丙欲强行遝入，依法可以拒絕。（四）此項情形與第一項相彷彿，可參考第一項答案。如乙向某甲追償，將抵頂費可依據復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條請求法院增加給付。</p>

<h3>火油雜汽油極易釀成火災　警局已嚴禁盼市民檢舉</h3>
<p>本市邇來因使用火油爐不愼，致發生火警者甚多。查其原因，大半爲火油價昂，奸商貪圖不法利潤，或以汽油攙入火油，或自製人造火油出售，有以致之。據悉，人造火油乃柴油，松香水或各種礦物油攙以汽油等易燃液體製成，燃燒性質與火油相似，但製造不善，性質無定，使用時極易釀成火災。攙有汽油之火油，其閃光點較普通火油爲高，試以純火油少許傾注於小鐵罐或瓷碟內，燃以火柴，不起　燒，如將火柴梗全部浸入火油，火焰反被熄滅，須再用一根火柴，火油表面始能引燃。含有汽油者則不然，汽油成份爲百分之五者，約於火柴點燃三秒鐘後燃燒，百分之十者，一遇火星，全部表面立即起火，爲禍至烈，與人造汽油同。警察局消防處對此已予深切注意，禁止出售，甚望全體市民予以合作，如發現所購火油可疑者，迅即電知警察局消防處，或該管分局，俾得檢騐後予以嚴厲懲處。</p>

<h3>公費留學生講習會　昨在教部行始業氏　朱部長親臨主持說明要旨</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕公費留學生講習會，今日上午在教部行始業式，到考取公費留學生百五十餘人。朱部長親臨主持，說明講習之要旨，特請專家作專題演講指導，以為出國就學之參考，並說明留學政策。我國歷年歸國之留學生，對學術文化及國家建設，貢獻甚多，自國府奠部迄今，國內若干大學漸臻完備，造就人才既多，由此日進，不難與歐西大學比肩，故就理論與實際言，大學生無須出洋，現在政府選考留學生，是一種政策，不是一種制度，非硬性規定按年派遣，視需要情形必要時舉行考選。本部此次鑒於戰後大學師資缺乏，舉辦考選，其科目是「社會科學」與「自然科學」並重，兼取文學藝術，顧及全面需要。至中午散會。下午即開始講習。該會為期三週，分「特約」，「專寄」，「國內外大勢」，「西洋禮俗」等演講與自由討論及座談會講習。講師除政府首長與專家外，尚有各國大使及文化參贊。該會在講習期間，並赴各地參觀。聞英美大使館，將定期茶會，招待各學員。</p>

<p>本週市長盃足球賽　青白遇優游　東華逢猶太</p>
<p>本週足球秩序，昨經足委會排定公佈，共有四場，均在逸圍角逐，週六下午三時市長盃青白相逢優遊，週末上午八時半起乙組總決賽青白乙與鐵路對　，十時半起甲組第二循環蘇聯迎接龍傑，下午三時半起，市長盃複賽東華與猶太交鋒。</p>
<p>週六市長盃複賽，青白對優遊，自週優遊以一比〇勝精武，青白以二比〇勝鐵路而告晉級。雙方在聯賽中，曾兩次和局終場，可見勢均力敵，惟優遊門將張榮才，於上週離滬赴港，投效星島，實力不無損失，然青白缺少吳鎮祥，後衛亦缺人材補充，一旦相逢，劇戰不免。</p>
<p>乙組決賽，青白乙對鐵路，前者如張仁義，姜閣清，徐國福等，曾於上週市長盃中，相逢鐵路，表演不弱。後者於市長盃中，曾逼和青白甲，再戰始告低頭，故門力亦不遜，此番乙組總決賽，為錦標之爭奪，自有熱烈演出。</p>
<p>甲組聯賽，蘇聯對龍傑，雙方在第一循環中，蘇聯曾以九比〇大勝龍傑，本週二次相會，龍傑圖報前仇，自當誓死相抗，惟蘇聯近況甚佳，屆時相逢，龍傑慎防覆轍重蹈。</p>
<p>市長盃複賽聯賽常勝軍東華迎戰黑馬猶太，前者自本屆稱雄甲組以來，大有兼併市長盃錦標之雄心，全隊實力，雄厚異常，而猶太素稱黑馬，此番邀得葡商名將福恩助戰，實力益見充實，勝者將與蘇聯火倂。全部秩序誌後：</p>
<p>三月廿二日（星期六）</p>
<p>青白—優遊（市長盃）　三時正　逸圍</p>
<p>三月廿三日（星期日）</p>
<p>青白乙—鐵路（乙組決）　八時半　逸圍</p>

<h3>羽毛球賽熱　名手打來好</h3>
<p>公開羽球昨晚在市體育館舉行，名將雲集，各組悉入精美階段，觀衆欣賞。（一）初單金元霖二對一勝奚慶恒，（二）高單徐國華二對〇勝蔡克文。（三）李國璠二對〇勝安維，（四）末組為雙打，都是好手火倂，係昨晚競爭最烈之一幕，洪德全倪元一勝陶冠球倪正一，結果二對〇，各組競爭狀況如下：</p>
<p>初級單打</p>
<p>金元霖對奚慶恒，第一局互相上下，迨十分平手後，奚連得五分，以十五比十勝。第二局金順流而下，以十五比四扳回一局，第三局各二後，金頓增六分，雙方多高球往返，奚時觸網自殺，金以十五比四勝。</p>
<p>金元霖</p>
<p>十比十五　十五比四　十五比四</p>
<p>奚慶恒</p>
<p>高級單打</p>
<p>蔡克文對徐國華，徐為羽球沙場名將，身經數百戰，以反手球攻對方弱點（蔡反手較差），首局以十五比一成功。</p>
<p>徐之拿手為擊球時將球拍舉頭頂繞一環，故擊出之球急而沉重，還擊為難，蔡頗有幾下表演，使人滿意，但年齡和經騐不如耳。徐復以十五比二勝。</p>
<p>徐國華</p>
<p>十五比一　十五比二</p>
<p>蔡克文</p>
<p>第二組高級單打為李國璠對安維，李發咸殺球，連懸五分，安維不慌不忙，沉着應戰，柔能克馴，戰成均勢，奈丸比七後一蹶不振，李十五比七勝。</p>
<p>地綫互易，李亦變化戰循，安曾超出一分（九—八），而繼以若干平手，李卒以十五比十壓倒安維。</p>
<p>李國璠</p>
<p>十五比七　十五比十</p>
<p>安維</p>
<p>雙打複賽</p>
<p>洪德全倪元一對陶冠球倪正一，雙方各手相會，勢均力敵，初成各二，繼成十平，首局以十五比十一制勝。第二局激戰尤烈，雙方　段週旋，比數一再平等，各五後洪倪超越二分，彈指已成各七，陶開球得一分，洪倪伺隙進攻，十五比九，大功告成。</p>
<p>洪德全倪元一</p>
<p>十五比十一　十五比九</p>
<p>陶冠球倪正一</p>

<h3>改革幣制方案雖經提議　如何實施尙待商討　目前一切措施均以穩定爲第一</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕某經濟　　十七日語本報記者，政府目前所採經濟措施，主要目的在使當前經濟能漸次由非常　入正常，在一切步入正軌以前，尙不考慮發行新幣、外傳政府將改變幣制說，全不可靠。此次三中全會所提經濟改革方案，對未來經濟措施，確有全盤計劃，然並未計劃目前即將發行新幣。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日報載三中全會提付討論之經濟改革方案內，對改革幣制一案，有主張設立金本位制之說。記者當以此事詢諸財政界某要員，渠稱：對此事並無所聞。惟旣係提案，目前當　屬改革幣制之一種意見。據渠個人意見：目前實施金本位制恐非其時。將來整理幣制時，是否適於採用金本位制，亦　視當時之情形而定，否則亦未必能收預期之效果。渠表示：目前政府一切經濟金融措施，終以維特平穩安定為前提。茲經濟新方案頒行伊始，方期國內經濟金融情况，逐步安定。一切足以另起波瀾之經濟措施，如近傳變更匯率之說，當不致予以考慮。</p>
<p>又記者分訪中央銀行若千要員，及金融界人士，彼等均表示對此事未有所聞。某金融界要員發表意見稱：我國目前所施行之幣制，又稱為管理外匯制。對內則以法定之貨幣流通，對外則採管理匯兌制。國內法幣，因受連年戰事影響，發行不無膨脹，致影響法幣持有人之心理。故今後幣制改革，似應着重恢復人民對通貨之信心。惟為便於管理計，實施金本位制時，亦不必一定流通金屬硬幣，可以庫存定額之貨金，比例發行定額之代價紙幣。惟該項庫存黃金，及紙幣之發行額，務須定期公開發表，並請各社團組織監管會，負擔監管之職。惟類此之幣制改革，目前終非其時。大致在財政收支比較接近，政治環境安定，交通秩序恢復之時，整理幣制，方易於着手。</p>

<h3>美國需要　大量洋針</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市瑞商某洋行告記者稱：最近美國屢電我出口商，要求我供給洋針，數量頗大。是項洋針，在美國本為英商及捷克所供給，近以無法迅速交貨，致美國極度缺少。我國在遞廠商產量尙豐，大量出口亦無問題。但美商出價只允依照英捷所交易之限度，每萬為美金十二元，但我廠盤每萬枚價須十三美元，故尙無法出口。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨市人造絲，上午甚堅穩，一二〇號高山有光六百三十萬元置進，三十五萬元賣出。下午因利買消息傳佈市塲，各廠商紛紛搜購，於是喊價頓然抬高，晨後喊五十萬元賣出，結果比上週末大起二十萬元。廠經市况甚寂，價與週末無甚軒輊。綢貨實銷甚淡，被面依然未更。大誠格子璧縐上午一萬六千六百元成交，人絲羽紗比較俏利，做價五千五百元。</p>
<p>中信局配售</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局昨日縱續配售人造絲予絲織業，按該業去年十二月份申請數量，先配十分之一，計的二百三十餘筐。配價照舊，高山牌每箱仍為五百二十萬元，天橋牌每箱仍為五百五十萬元。</p>
<h3>購棉所需美滙　央行已允撥付　第一季四千萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會外棉核配委員會，於昨日上午十時，召開會議。討論結果，中央銀行對第一季外棉限額所需美匯四千萬元，已允撥付。現正待央行與各外棉淮口商洽商，矚將已訂購之外棉，先起運來華。所需外匯，則由央行分期撥付。又因聯總有棉花廿萬包運華，故第一季（二月至四月）四千萬美元之外棉限額之期限，已可展延至本年六月份為止。在此期間，所需補充之外棉，己母　廣乏。至下半年度所需補充之外棉，常局亦巳表示設法供給所需之外匯頭寸，決不致使各紗廠因原棉短絀而停工。又昨日會議席上，有人提議各紗廠出口紗布所得之外匯頭寸，准各紗廠自行運用，結購外棉。討論結果，仍認為應交統籌辦理為妥云。</p>
<h3>六區棉紡公會議價單　紡管會原則接受　轉送物價委員會核議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會為審議棉紗價格事，特於昨日下午四時，在市府會議室，召開臨時會議。討論經過，對六區棉紡公會議價小組委員會所提供之議價單、包括：（一）收購棉紗價格，廿支標準紗，每件最高價的合三百〇幾萬元。（二）各廠自由買賣之廠盤議價，廿支標準紗每件最高價以成本計，的合三百九十九萬餘元，原則已表示接受。即交由經濟部王部長携京，俾再送物價委員會核議云。</p>
<h3>紗價堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日紗市粗平綫俏，念支紗交易仍　微末，因紡管會有提高收購價之說，是以續見堅挺。四十二支雙股綫因貨根極少，經不起織廠略加吸吶，價遂一跳五六十萬，是後成交七百卅五萬之鉅。</p>
<p>紡建售紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售二七六七件，內廠商二四一三件，紗號三五四件。申請共一一八三戶，內廠商八三四戶，紗號三四九戶。</p>
<h3>棉布客銷不寂</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，高檔細布天津漢口兩帮續有進胃，人心步堅。十二磅龍頭細布自十五萬七千元做開，步高至十六萬二千五百元，較週六軋升六千元。藍鳳價做十五萬元，彩球十五萬五千元，俱漲五六千元。其餘低檔貨亦升三四五千元不一。嗶嘰本客帮亦有納胃，四君子價為十五萬五千元升三千五百元。金蓮紗舞十四萬九千元升四千元。紡建之二十支細布，昨各帮納胃不寂，聞該貨品質可能代替香港衫布原料之用，故價亦俏俐，做十三萬一千元至三千元。其餘漂布元布及直貢，價亦軋升三四五千元，惟士林布藍布平穩云。</p>
<h3>洋莊茶市步輭</h3>
<p>紅綠茶內銷狹窄多時，終少進展，人心欲好無力。至於洋莊茶市，英商緊視之紅茶，一片買聲依然甚囂塵上，惟對於價格方面，非巧不取，而賣戶雖自願讓步，但因成本關係，不忍過份輕脫，是以昨日交易，未能在順利中做開，形勢亦露軟化。他若各色錄茶，吐納仍有，情况尙活，然行市則受紅茶趨衰之影響，已不若上週之輩固，脚地恐難站住。</p>
<h3>四千噸大豆供榨油中信局月內可配出</h3>
<p>本市搾油業為配售食油，曾經由吳市長獲得當局面允撥大豆四千噸，貼補各廠損失，因當時未有公文至中信局，故最近政府人事更調後，此項原料，中信司不允撥給，該業於理事曾中商議後，推派經濟部中植油廠廠長張德成晋京，面謁行政院秘書長蔣夢麟，要求經常供給原料榨油配售，並論及公教人員配油由中植油廠負担後，所有虧額，由國庫支付。張氏於前日返滬，據稱供給四千噸原料事，由經濟部呈文行政院，並由吳市長備函證明，月內可以配出。配價方面，廠方要求中信局以成本配給，約五萬五千元一担。目前各廠每月配油合計三萬担，四千噸大豆僅能榨油八千担。廠商方面希望能獲取廉價原料，使各廠業務更有生氣，現在食油限價二十五萬元、利潤菲薄，已呈文財政部請豁免千分之十五營業稅，財部已允考慮。</p>

<h3>無捐無稅　無拘無束　逍遙的納伐達</h3>
<p>二月二十六日雷諾航訊本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>在美國，沒有一個省份，比納伐達更逍遙，更自由的了。紐約州很繁羣，但是繁羣並不就是逍遙。在紐約市內，你看見那些人，整天都忙得喘不過氣來。加利福尼亞很富庶，但是加利福尼亞的美國人，他們為生活而工作，情緒都並不鬢懈。祗有納伐達是一個例外，你旅行在納伐達州的任何一個城市鄉村裏，你看見那些逍遙自在的人，他們像從來不想到什麽呌工作，他們更從來不知道什麽呌法律的拘束！</p>
<p>無捐無稅　也沒有警察</p>
<p>納伐達是有法律的，納伐達人有句口號，呌做：『生活，快樂，守法』。他們從來不做遠反法律的事。全省十五萬人民，路不拾遣，夜不閉戶，這是他們的守法精神。但是，法律給予他們行為的的束，是很小得驚人的，婚姻絕對自由，離了婚再結婚，結了婚又離婚，那是家常便飯。賭博不但是公開的，而且是省政府扶植獎勵的。納伐達的任何城鎮裏，看不見警察，省政府轄免任何捐稅。全美國四十八州，祗有納伐達，沒有所得稅，沒有遺產稅，沒有過份利得稅，沒有消費品稅……一句話，納伐達是「個無捐無稅的省份。在紐約市內，一包駱駝牌香烟，現在小雜貨舖子賣到一角九分。但在納伐達，祇要一角五分錢就够了。</p>
<p>納伐達的面積，相當於三個江蘇省，到現在的人口總數，還祗十五萬。美國原是一個人口密度很稀的國家，但是像納伐達那樣的比例，也是不多見的。納伐達的『方輿志』上說：它的人口，是近十五年來才增加的，第一次歐戰前後，該是最荒凉的時節。</p>
<p>參觀金鑛　一座黃金山</p>
<p>我嘗過這可怕的『荒凉』的滋味，那是在我逗留在佛傑尼亞小城的那晚上。佛傑尼亞城距雷諾大概九十多英里，我一大早搭公共汽車去參觀那兒的金鑛。那是一座呌做「黃金山」的礦區，在佛傑尼亞東南一英里。七十年前，當美國「西移運動」如火如荼的時候，黃金山上聚滿着成千的草莽英雄，他們都是從東部遷移過來的「亡命之徒」，開發了黃金山，也繁榮了佛傑尼亞城。</p>
<p>南北戰爭促成了美國西部的開發，偉大的林育總統，在對付南方軍盡旁午之際，他用很多時間注視着落磯山區域的發展。這些白種人新掠得的廣裏地區，在南北戰爭時代，都是林肯的擁護者，那時候的納伐達英雄雷諾，約瑟將軍，他的名字，現在成了世界著名的地名。雷諾附近的「斯派克斯」城，也是由於紀念南北戰爭時代的納伐達省省長約翰斯派克斯而得名的。</p>
<p>南北戰爭結束以後的十年間，美國完成了建國途程中最最重要的一步：從大西洋海岸直通到太平洋海岸的鐵路，一八六八年，南北停戰後三年，鐵路工人開發了雷諾，那時候，佛傑尼亞小城，已經有了相當的繁榮。內戰時代的英雄格蘭第將軍，於一八七九年宣撫納伐達州，在佛傑尼亞城被熱烈歡迎，我還有到很多當年的照片，那時節，美國建國的基礎，已經是大定了。</p>
<p>但是，黃金有採完的時節，隨着黃金的聲盡，佛傑尼亞城就顯得冷落起來。亡命的勞工們，紛紛走了，祇賡下五百個居民，稀稀落落點綴在這座半山荒凉的城上。續穴現在流著溫泉，當地人說：雞蛋可以在溫泉中煮熟，我問他們：還看到金沙沒有？他們搖愰着腦袋。</p>
<p>我在敗瓦舊屋的佛傑尼亞城裏躭了一夜，黃昏，路燈半明不滅，一個人踏在木板的人行道上，祗有我自己的鄭重的脚步聲，死城的寂寞，使我不由得不感到胆怯，我第一次看到美國的古舊荒凉的城市。</p>
<p>然而，縱然是那樣的地區，也仍然是逍遙的，小小的狹長酒吧裏，有著好幾桌賭博，麻雀雖小，賭的規模却和曾諾一摸一樣。很多賭客拿新奇的目光望着我，也許他們從來沒有看見過；一個從幾萬里路以外來的黃種人。</p>
<p>金鑛掘完　銀鑛在開採</p>
<p>賭塲老闆的我喝酒，他告訴我許多六十年前，這兒挖掘黃金的故事。他說：現在佛傑尼亞的金鑛是完了，但是卡爾遜城（納伐達省會）附近的銀礦，還依然在開採，納伐達各地賭塲上，淸一色的銀洋餅子，其中一大半是納伐達造幣廠自己鑄的。</p>
<p>他還說：當年白種人打到納伐達來，和紅印第安人打過血仗。白種人為了搶奮金鑛，都打的非常英勇。如令，金是沒有了，銅，鎳，鋅之類的鑛產還很多。雷諾城郊的納伐達省立大學，以鑛冶工程著名。</p>
<p>接着，他又嘆慨起來；佛僯尼亞這小城，是再也沒有多大希望的了。「荒山野地，誰願上這兒來化錢？」他說：納伐達省什麽都不禁，祇禁公娼。但是，為了繁榮佛傑尼亞，省政府特准設立佛傑尼亞「公娼館」，「公娼館的別名，呌作紅燈龍」！</p>
<h3>雄偉的滑雪塲　吉諾亞與玫瑰山</h3>
<p>「自由」在納伐達是充沛的。因為自由，納伐達人並不為荒凉而感到寂寞。我從佛傑尼亞轉返雷諾的途中，又觀光了『天邊酒家』Sky　Tavern的「滑雪」。滑雪，是納伐達人瘋狂的愛好，他們從陽曆十一月到第二年的五月，經常用滑雪來點綴他們逍遙的日子！</p>
<p>汽車轉迥上無數的山坡，才爬到「天邊酒家」，那兒有滑雪的優美的設備，有餐聽，有音樂，還停著無數的轎車。我前年在瑞士作冬遊，也學過滑雪，這回看美國人玩的，似乎更新奇，更勇敢。一位年靑的美國女孩子說：納伐達全省都是滑雪的好地方，塲面更偉大的，有「吉諾亞」和攻瑰山滑雪塲。</p>
<p>吉諾亞在納伐達省的西南角，一個以滑雪起家的城市。滑雪塲有一英里長，一千尺高，每年納伐達和加利福尼亞的省際滑雪比賽，定二月二十三，二十四兩天，在吉諾亞舉行。玫瑰山距雷諾較近，在泰和湖的北岸，那兒有三英里長的滑雪塲，上下距離二千五百英尺，站在遠處，看塲面硬是雄偉。每年，納伐達省立大學，和西方學院，在這兒作校際滑雪比賽。</p>
<p>我沒有趕上比賽的日子，據說，每次比賽，總吸引着幾千遠道而來的觀衆。吉諾亞和攻瑰山兩處的設備，是同一個老闆建造的，他的滑雪廣告上說：滑雪塲附近，有高等旅館，有音樂院，有酒吧，也有上等餐廳，「如果貴客於早一日通知，餐廳可以辦理一千人的中餐或晚餐」！</p>
<p>騎獵游泳　遊人的天堂</p>
<p>高度發展的物質文明，打破了荒凉與寂寞。冬天一過去，春天的騎馬，狩獵，夏天的游泳的季節，更令人沉醉欲狂。雷諾附近有兩座湖，泰和湖和金字塔湖，雖然是鹽水，但都有一片碧藍的顏色。泰和湖上的夏天，是遊人的天堂，是多少羅曼諦克製造所，那兒有潔雅的旅館，花園，森林，游泳池，我因為冬遊，看不見熱鬧的景色。金字塔湖的冬天更荒凉，湖中有巍然獨立的巖石，像埃及金字塔。</p>
<p>賭博離婚　非正規生活</p>
<p>納伐達人有一句名言，呌做：「納伐達沒有正規的生活」。在中國，我們稱為「逍遙」。來到雷諾的外省人，不是為離婚，便是為了賭博。（註：賭與離婚，見本報前刊通訊），睹和離婚的本身，便是逍遙的，不正規的。納伐達人更說：「當你那一天離去，你便得納稅」。納伐達的法律的基本原則，是「租稅自由」；許多人把資金轉移到納伐達來，逃稅也是原因之一。此外，納伐達還有四季分明的好天時，每年睛天的日子佔百分之七十八，因此，初到的人，不免稍嫌乾燥，但是，納伐達人說：雖然乾，但乾得令人爽快，令人有生氣蓬勃Invigorating之感！</p>
<p>嶺中之城　拉斯伐加斯</p>
<p>納伐達最大的城市是雷諾，其次是「拉斯伐加斯」，（第二　婚　），近年來，美國南方幾州，乃至於洛杉磯，好萊塢的許多離婚生意，都給拉斯伐加斯搶了過去。從雷諾到拉斯伐加斯，公路　在山裏走，許多人都坐專班飛機，飛機票祇收二十二元五角。</p>
<p>我沒有去拉斯伐加斯，祇在納伐達西邊幾個城市走了一圈，比較暹是以雷諾最為熱鬧。雷諾有兩家報館，兩家週升，一半是共和黨的，一半是民主黨的。共和黨在納伐達的地方　礎較深，那長因為過去林肯總統時代的遺澤。羅斯福時代，民主黨在納伐達也較前有發展。</p>
<p>華僑醫師　納伐達僑領</p>
<p>納伐達大學在雷諾附郊，以鍍冶工程著稱，聽說：有兩位中國學生，在這兒求學，我都沒有碰到。華僑在納伐達人數極少，一位古稀老華僑關老先生，在雷諾行醫，他從前當過舊金山中華公會的會長，現在是納伐達僑領，已經有卅多年沒有返中國。很早以前，他在京師大學堂念書，看過那時候的上海申報。關老先生帶我參觀僑胞的生活，有一家呌做「新星」的賭塲，是羣僑開設的，我看見襄面有幾十個黑男女，在那兒賭傳。白種人開設的大賭窟，是絕對不准黑人及紅印靖安人賭博的，因此，這筆生意，便落到了華僑身上。</p>
<p>華僑也有一座中萎會館，會館附近，從前也有一點小小的「唐人街」，後來因為拆修馬路，邃成為零落不堪。關老先生還帶我看了不少博物館和遊　塲，裏邊都陳列有對紅印第安人的戰蹟。美國人是不會忘却他們怎樣戰勝了紅印第安人的，也許，正如同我們都知道『黃帝敗豈尤於琢鹿』一樣。</p>
<p>生產不多　鑛藏已無幾</p>
<p>納伐達有兩家大銀行：「第一銀行」和「商業銀行」，這十五萬人口的省份，生產不多：鑛藏，木材是兩樣大宗，現在，鑛藏也所賸無幾了。像沙漠一樣的泥土上，是沒有農業生產的，大部份的糧食，都　外省運來。但是，納伐達的銀行，仍然有生意可做，納伐達有的是迸資！</p>
<p>美國人稱紼伐達為『沙漠帝國』，實際上，納伐達並不像大戈璧沙漠，或撒哈拉沙漠。納伐達是落磯山的一隅，拔海在四千五百英尺以上。納伐達全省，除了幾顆人造的都市以外，原野間盡是光禿禿的章山，亂草荒邱，幾十里不見人烟。</p>
<p>聯邦自治，造成了納伐達逍遙畸形的社會，納伐達正需要這一份「逍遙」，來吸引著四面八方的遊客！</p>
<h3>廣西交通喜訊</h3>
<p>— 桂林八日航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>最近使人感覺高興的，是一條一條鐵路的暢通，一段一段織路的修建，桂柳段通車後，接着便是柳宜段的通車，緊接着的又是桂衡段在重修。柳湛（湛江）的興建，一大堆的交通喜訊，仿佛一個受了重創的人完全接好了血管，再加上一服盤尼西林，行見一年多後，廣西又是一片光明的景象。湘桂黔路局長袁行見一年多後，廣西又是一片光明的景象。湘桂黔路局長袁夢鴻，並因工作努力，迭獲嘉獎，刻苦奮鬥的精神，的確使手來敲成一條鐵橋的故事，它會比共產黨關於吳滿有的勞動故事更感人得多。</p>

<h3>論通貨管理並建議發行「物價指數國庫券」　（中）</h3>
<p>— 李崇淮</p>
<p>（三）關於發展貿易者：政府提高匯率。其目的在求　動輸出物查的增產。但數日之中，桐油價格躍出四十萬大關，其他出口物價亦在少漂中，水漲船高，出口業獲得多少鼓勵，殊堪疑問。反觀其他生產事業，凡自國外訂購生產器材或原料者，均紛紛呌苦，對於生產復興及增產打擊之大，非問小可。進口貨價格，更一日倍頻。有關進出口貿易的物資旣已紛紛上漲，由國人民的心理一向是敏感的，勢必也連帶促成其他物價之上漲。蓋以政府增發的通貨無法管理，不久，提高匯率所收的效用勢必又被冲銷了。</p>
<p>（四）關於物價工資及日用必需晶之供應者：在通貨未得管理以前，嚴格管理物價是不可能的。前已說過，人民的錢拿在手中，一定要有一個出路，除去日常消費者，人民最低的要求是堡仔其儲蓄價値。銀行存息太低，生產投資利潤低而風險大，於是只有放高利貸或囤積貨物。物價的表面固可因政治管制而釘定，但黑市將無法消滅，限價下的物品品質亦必日趨下流。人民不買的東西，政府絕不能要他買；人民要買的東西，限制他不買還得想辦法去買。這是人民經濟本能的驅使，故即在英美先進國家，尙有黑市，何况我國人民的教育程度及守法精神如是落後？統籌物資的供應，更是促漲物價的因素。因為政府統購物資，勢必是大量的，凡是鉅額的需求，對於市塲的反應一定大，結果不帝政府在無形中代替了人民做了囤積的主人翁！</p>
<p>七　「物價指數國庫券」之產生</p>
<p>總上所述，政治性的硬性的多頭管制，實不若經濟性的簡單的勞動手腕。這簡單的經濟手腕，便是爲人民利餘的購買力找出路，也就是通貨管理最佳的法門。</p>
<p>黃金政策旣已失去支援，（是失去黃金供給量的支援而不是失去興論的支援），公債又不能用通常手段來發行，勢非找出其他的工具不可。這種工具應有兩個要件：（一）具有保持儲蓄價値的特性，方才足以引導人民的剩餘購買力；（二）具有充份的兌換價値，使人民於需要時隨時可以向政府兌換。根據這兩種特性，筆者特建議發行一種以物價指數為標準的國庫券。茲就該券之發行方法，物價指數之厘手問題，人民對於該券之信任問題，還本付息問題，該券之作用及其所獲效果與影響等，分別申述如後：</p>
<p>八「物價指數國庫券」之發行方法</p>
<p>該券得分甲，乙，丙，三種券面發行，均為無面額。在最初發行之日，此三種庫券得分別按十萬元，百萬元，千萬元掛牌，以後於每週按物價指數掛牌一次。物價指數增加時，其掛牌即分別按物價指數增加率之比例計算。若本週間與上週物價指數相等，或上漲率不及年息六厘時，則本週之牌價按上週之牌價加上年息％6計算，其意在保障人民之利益。在物價上漲時期，人民固得儲蓄保障，在物價穩定之時，人民亦有利息可得，其時該券即等於年利六厘之公債。</p>
<p>「物價指數國庫券」之買賣牌價原則上相同，但遇必要時，政府得將志價抑抵或買價略為提高，但在任何情形下，收價不得低於根據物價指數計算之牌價，在任何情形下，全國各地之買賣價亦應一致。</p>
<p>「物價指歟國庫券」之發售，除政府委託中央銀行全權代理外，並應由中央銀行委託其他國家銀行代爲辦理，以增加其吸收通貨之力量。各國家銀行買賣「物價指數國庫券」之牌價，應與央行掛牌相同，央行得另付手續費千分之若干，或以所售現款若干成存於該行，作為事業貸款之用。但國家銀行每日實售實購餘額，須於每日營業終了報告中央銀行。國家銀行自己不得購買國庫券，因其資金應用於生產事業及其他國策貸款也。商業銀行及錢荘於開始發行時，每家按存款額攤派二成，其後亦至少以保有二成餘額為度，自願增加者聽便。事實上銀錢行荘將樂於多投資於「物價指數國庫券」，蓋其不但利息優厚，且可保持其資產之價値，不致於隨同貨幣貶値。商業行莊所存央行存款準備金，得以在款减去投資於國庫券之款項計算。</p>
<p>「物價指數國庫券」得分為記名或不記名兩種，任購者選擇。該項庫券可以隨時向當地國家銀行按當時牌價十足兌取現歡，但不得充作國家銀行借款之抵押品，蓋因國庫券實際利息高，而國家銀行放款息低恐奸商從中套利也。</p>
<p>各地發行之國庫券應加蓋發行地名，如在上海發行者加蓋「上海發行」字樣，漢口發行者加蓋「漢口發行」字樣，國庫券可以在異地兌取，惟在兌取時應减去兌時原發行地與兌換地兩處聞所應付之匯水，以免商人藉此逃避匯款之限制。</p>
<p>「物價指數國庫券」之發行，還可用以收回黃金。蓋用法幣收回黃金，政府負担過鉅，値此時期，尤足增强通貨膨脹之危機，用該券代以法幣付給，則有收回黃金之功而無發行通貨之弊矣。</p>
<p>九　發行「物價指數國庫券」所依據之物價指數如何厘定</p>
<p>筆者以為該項物價指數之厘定，似可以下列各點為標準：</p>
<p>（一）物種之選擇及加　方法，宜以中等家庭之日常消費爲標準，否則內容亦以愈廣泛態好。物價指數不宜太低，太低則不足引誘人民投資；亦不宜太高，太高則恐刺激其他物價上漲。總之，物價指數以能代表一般物價水準為佳。國旗券牌價的計算，旣有準繩，便不會引起像黃金那樣的投機風潮。其詳細計算方法，可由統計學者另行商定，但政府所採用之計算方法應行公告。</p>
<p>（二）全國各地物價指數應統一，換句話說，各地「物價指數國庫券」的牌價不宜有所差別。因為若有差別，勢必引起資金不正常的流動及投機者的取巧　利，如已往之黃金市塲然。因為物價指數應劃一，則自不能以一地為準，故其物價指數應以許多地方物價之均數求之，其基期數亦同。至於應以何時為　期，其關係殊微。以二十六年一—六月各地物價為甚數固可，以「物價指數國庫券」發行日之物價指數為　數亦無不可。蓋「物價指數國庫券」之牌價係以兩期相比而決定者。計算物價指數所包括之地點得為上海·南京·天津（或北平，潘陽（或長春），靑島·漢口·重慶·昆明·長沙·廣州·西安·蘭州·迪化·西康等地。</p>
<p>（三）物價指數應每週計算一次，各地中央銀行（或由四聯辦理亦可，其無中央銀行及叫聯分處之地得由其他國家銀行代理）應於每星期五將所規定之物種在一週內之平均價格，電告上海總行，由總行彙集，按己公佈之計算辦法，計算其所得本週之物價指數及國庫券牌價，最遲應於星期日電告各地中央銀行及其他經售銀行，各地經售銀行應同時於星期一日晨公佈「物價指數國庫券」這牌價，並同時於各地報端公佈此種物價指數之內容。</p>
<p>上述物價指數之公佈，距實際物價報道相隔有二天之久，此種時差，在物價繼續上漲時，購買者或稍有損失，然與實際利息相比，甚爲有限。因各地電報往返需時，二日之差，實不可再少。筆者所以選擇星期五至星期一者，蓋以其中星期六下午至星期日之一天半時光，多為不交易者，故事實上僅隔一日而已。持有國庫券數週或數月以上者，此種差別幾等於零。</p>
<p>十　人民對於「物價指數國庫券」的信任問題</p>
<p>「物價指數國庫券」之發行方法及其計算標準旣如前述，惟發行「物價指數國庫券」並無實物担保，而係以政府的信用為基礎。但現政府已一再失信於人民，人民對政府旣不能信任，則該券能否順利推銷，以達成其吸收通貨的使命，不無疑問。</p>
<p>就經濟觀點來看，即使人民對「物價指數國庫券」的發行半信半疑，該券仍然可以發行，而且一定獲得相當效果。筆者前曾指出「物價指數國庫券」所應具的兩種特性，即保持儲蓄價値及隨時可以向政府兌換，只要政府能絕對保持這兩點，一定可以有優良的結果，而這兩點是不難保持的。以美金為担保的美金公債及情券，以黃金為背景的存款，都與此種國庫券不同。因為美金和黃金的本身都有其對外的交換價値，且絕對的受有「量」的限制，政府不願意輕易犧牲這部財產，因此就對人民的信用打了折扣。國庫券的償還數然是以國庫收入為基礎，而事實上就是法幣。就政府來講，只要償還時所增發的法幣與整個經濟沒有什麽大害處，增發是無所謂的（請見本文後論）。就人民言，只要政府在這物價上漲期中，為其保存的備蓄價健不變，尙有何求？所謂儲蓄價値不變，具體的說，若是人民於購買「物價指數國庫券」時其所花的錢足够買一担米，一年半載以後，（或隨時隨地）其用該券所兌換出來的法幣仍可購買一担米，這種儲蓄比囤購實物來得好。因為囤轉實物，不一定是隨時所需要的束西，今年買五担米，但是一年內，不見得吃完，若是年底需要衣料，拿米來換衣料並不是那樣直接了當的事。購買「物價指數國庫券」也比把錢存在銀行錢荘　好，假若人民對政府不信任，其不信任的程度決不比把錢存入錢荘放拆息來得强。人民心驚　頭地把錢存人錢莊或放給私人，為的什麽？還不是希望得一點高利息，以補積在物價上漲期中的儲蓄損失。但「物價指數國庫券」的利息，還比存款在任何行荘為高。這理由很簡單，因為在物價上漲時，物價的上漲率（也就等於「物價指數國庫券」的利息）總是比商業利息高。因為借款利息是商業最重要的成本，商人銷貨的利潤必須高於成本，才能維持。假設銷貨的利潤不够愼付其借款利息，勢必有三途可循：（一）當物資之供給少於需要時，商人將抬高物價，（二）當物資之供給超過需要時，商人將俟利息殺低後再借款；（三）週轉不靈瀕於倒閉。因此在任何情形下，物價上漲　勢必高於銀行錢荘的放款利率，自然也更高於銀行錢荘的存款利率了。前文曾指出本年正月的躉售物價高於去年同期約七倍，是每月土漲約56％强，而錢荘的放款拆息約在20％左右，存息約在12%左右，足以證明此說。購買「物價指數國庫券」的利息旣比存錢於行荘來得高，而且較為可靠，人民一定會將錢投資於此。再就銀行錢莊而言，恐怕也將以「物價指數國庫券」為大部投資的對象，這也是因為其利息高於行莊的放款利率，而且較信用放款可靠之故。其更有利於一銀行錢荘者，便是行荘並不需獵取其放款顧客而得以坐享其利，且更可按自身頭寸的多寡，隨時隨地增加國庫券的投資或變為現金。我國大部的滙資是人民的剩餘購買力及銀行錢荘的投機信用，是則國庫券的發行，將會狂速地將這些剩餘購買力及商業投機信用加以收縮。利之所在，金石為開。「物價指數國庫券」的銷路，是不成問題的。</p>
<p>為了增强社會對於發行「物價指數國離券」的信任起見，筆者特於此尊重提出，該券之發行，應由行政當局交立法院及參政會審議後施行，以期獲得輿論及人民的贊助，其效必著。</p>
<p>十一　「物價指數國庫券」的還本付息問題</p>
<p>此恐將為當局及一般社會人士所最注意且欲得而解答者。在表函上看來，吾人所逢之還本付息問題，將較任何債務爲嚴重，在物價平穩時，吾人所付的利息僅為年利六匣。幷不為鉅，惟在物價上漲時，表面上雖未加上利息，而實際上所付之利息，則較一般利息為高，己見前論。如此利息、政府將如何負擔？</p>
<p>事實上這問題並不如想像的嚴重。首先，我們應認識「物價指數國庫券」的三種特點：一是該項國庫券的利息與本金不是分開計算的，其本息永遠是連在一起的。因此在計算方面並不如其他儐務那樣因難。二是該項國庫券的償還期並無規定，其發行則隨時按市塲的需要而伸縮，何時全部收回，政府也可按情決定，並無拘束。三任何一時間的買賣牌價在原則上相等，政府隨時隨地賣出，也隨時隨地購進。因此我們所應討論政府的負債問題，也就側重在任何一時間的收付餘額問題。</p>
<p>任何一時間的收付餘額情形，大致可分為四種：</p>
<p>（一）僅有賣出，沒有買進。這是開始發行的情形，只有放出「物價指數國庫券」以收進通貨，沒有償付的問題發生，因此無討論的必要。</p>
<p>（二）發行在進行中，賣出的國庫券總額超過買進的總額。這大概是物價不斷上漲時應有的現象，因為人民欲籍以保持儲蓄的價値，在這種情形下，政府繼續收進通貨，只有收穫，沒有負擔，也毋庸討論。</p>

<h3>溝通中法文化　蒂德羅獎金</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>在目前中國的智識界，恐怕知道「蒂德羅獎金」（Prix　Diderot）的人很少，知道這個獎金的重要性的人更少：所以我今天來做個扼要的介紹，希望智識份子特別注意。</p>
<p>我們先下一番正名工作：獎金以「蒂德羅」為名，「蒂德羅」是誰？杜尼。蒂德羅（Denis　Diderot）生於一七一三年，卒於一七八四年，是法國的哲學家。從一七五一年到一七七二年，凡二十一年，他和達期貝爾（Jean　IeRond　d＇Alembert）：一七一七—一七八三）主編和冽行「百科詞典」（Eocyclopedle）：這是十八世紀的一部鉅著，而且是世界性的鉅著。「百科詞典」，各國都有；那使在法國，也不止一部。那麽，為何這部十八世紀法國的「百科詞典」獨享盛名呢？因為有下列的兩個主要原因。</p>
<p>第一，因為本詞典的作者不但是各種學衛的專家，而且是大師，例如：伏兒戴爾（Voltaire：一六九四——一七七八），盧梭（Jean－Jacques　Rousseau：一七一二—一七七八），孟德斯鳩（Montesquieu：一六八九—一七五五），蒂爾古（AnneRobert　Jacques　Turgot：七二一—一七八一）…這些人，祗須中間一個肯執筆，已能光芒萬丈，何况他們羣策羣力，共襄盛舉？</p>
<p>第二，這更重要，該詞典含蓄一種精神，影響近代文化極大，人家就稱它：「百科詞典精神」。這是什麼精神呢？說來很簡單，創立却難，突施更難：（一）求知；（二）求眞；（三）思想自由。這三個階段是連貫的：為了求「知」，所以求「眞」，————不「真」的「知」不是眞知；——可是，如果思想不「自出」，便無從得「眞」。「百科詞典」本身就充分表現思想自由：因為以思想立塲，伏兒戴爾和慮梭——這兩位哲學界的鉅人——就是寃家對頭！</p>
<p>「蒂德羅獎金」的目標和努力，就要發揮這種：「求知」，「求眞」，「思想自由」的精神。</p>
<p>一九三六年，一位著名的女小說家亞歷山特拉。胡貝—姜斯紀夫人（Mme　Aexandra　Roube-Jansky），獲得中國方面李石曾先生贊助以後，創立這個獎金。她的辦法是如此的：她獲得法國政府的襄助，每年中法兩國交換兩個新聞記者（最近有更動，請觀下文，）坐頭等艙位，以及到了對方復遊歷時的一切費用，以六個月爲期，統歸政府招待。新聞記者遊歷時所有觀感，可以「自由」寫述；所寫的文章，由該獎金委員會負責介紹出版。新聞記者的選擇，由該獎金審議委員會（Jury）決定，而這個委員會是中法人士合租的。</p>
<p>一九三六年，一個法國的年輕新聞記者獲獎來過中國；却沒有中國人出去。為了什麽？我不知道。</p>
<p>一九三七年，又一個法國的年輕新聞者獲獎來過中國；又沒有中國人出去。為了什麼？我不知道。</p>
<p>此後因為戰事關係，獎金暫行中止。</p>
<p>最後，該獎金的審議委員會重新改組，從一九四七年起，該委員會的組織如下：主任委員：保兒—彭古（Paul-Boncour，前法國內閣總經）；委員：安德萊·費烏斯夫人（Mme　AndreViollis），着　，羅朗·篤兩日萊斯（Roland　Dorgeles），法蘭西斯·賈爾古（Francls　Carco），比埃爾·馬爾克·奧爾朗（Pierre　Marc　Orlan），兆如。禹依斯曼（Georges　　Huysmany），郭爾尼葛里翁—英里尼埃將軍（Cornigllon-Moilnier）舍哈爾·蒲埃（Gerard　Bauer），比埃爾。苔加芙（Pierre　Descaves），東尼—萊維雄（Tooy-Revillon）），兆如·夏昂叔兒（Georges　Charensol），以及法國外交部的兩位代表。</p>
<p>鑑於中國新聞記者懂法文的太少，今後關於中國方面，將不限於新聞記者，但以精通法文的作家為原則。</p>
<p>最近，胡貝—善斯紀夫人第三次來中國，策劃恢復這個「蒂德羅獎金」。</p>
<p>如果中國政府予以贊助，智識界予以同情，在一九四七年裏就可以派一位中國作家到法國去，一位法國新聞記者到中國來。（三六，三，十五。）</p>
<h3>村思　外外章</h3>
<p>— 匡瀛</p>
<p>城門</p>
<p>你是一個住慣大都會中人的最陌生客人。</p>
<p>每天你這過來永遠是站在市街的梢頭瞧盡往往來來的人；那些人間甜密的情話和尖刻的惡咒你是聽慣的；你不會動一動心，讓歲月侵蝕着你己剝落得可怖的面上。怎麽在這個世界都已裝扮得很美麗的時代裏，你連蓬鬆的鬢髮也不梳掠梳掠呢？</p>
<p>詩人把你裝置在吟詠邊塞的詩篇中，畫家把你安排在邊城落日的冷景中，你一個可憐的命運，似乎永遠祗能怑着凄凉和着索。</p>
<p>但，有一椿你是値得自傲的，就在這個荒僻的小城中吧？那些裝旂滿筐貨物和一腔歡欣從鄉下趕圩的人，當他們走過你的脅下來時，對你是那麽淸暱，他們一堆堆蹲前你膝前，訴說着各人最關切的心事，在道時，你是這小縣中最足驕傲的英雄了。</p>
<p>生活在人間還有一絲溫緩的土地上，你，終究還是不寂寞的。</p>
<p>溫馨</p>
<p>一連串的歡欣從掌中逃到天上，又從天上停到樹梢，這，我是把鴿鈴象徽着這人間曼妙的幻想。</p>
<p>白的翅膀，紅的嘴尖，雖然是翱翔在白雲中的一點，但看在一個水邊凝思的勞人眼中和一個倚在樓頭遠眺出神的少婦眼中，這多少是人間最溫馨的寄託。煩你把世界上最動聽而美麗的詞句，渡過山山水水帶給那些遠遠的征人去吧！</p>
<p>是在黃河之上；是在長江之濱，是在黑水白山之間，是在摩天大廈之巔，是在苦難和迫害的魔窟之阱，誰都仰望着天上的白雲，把連串的希望寄託在虛幻的寂寞之中。你用嘹亮的歌聲劃破了這寂寞的長空，也劃破了每個人冷落的心靈。</p>
<p>是人間少同情的寄與，還是那些殘酷者把痛苦塗抹在人間，但在這荒僻的小城中，我從沒有聽到過這輕期的鈴聲。</p>
<p>村思</p>
<p>一個春天的晚上，我獨自緩步在一條靠山的仄徑上，瞧着那些寂寞地像一頭頭乏力的耕牛蹲在地上的板屋，我的心裏充滿着空虛之感。</p>
<p>溪水潺潺地流去，連一個洗衣女都沒有呢？</p>
<p>一切一切都顯出那麽靜，我像站在荒島上數着水邊的貝壳；這上面誰去辦認連串從這天上掠過的歲月呢？我感到悲哀；但那時忽然傳來孩子們的歡笑聲，好做是鄰鈑的板量中傳出來的，當我旋頭去尋覓時，却迎來了一陣空漠的思想。</p>
<p>歸途上，我這樣想，不論什麽時候什麽地方，都有人在唱起抒情的歌曲的，但為了歡笑使你流出淚來，那時，你纔會去辦起歡　之處也是愁濃之處。</p>
<p>我的心沉重着；因為我無意中發為了一個人間的奧秘。</p>
<h3>痛苦的喜悅</h3>
<p>— 林澂</p>
<p>痛苦的理想，彷彿在明天的脚步下；而又覺得非當　遠……</p>
<p>是在回憶那消失了的意年？抑是留戀那被萊擲了的愛情？或者仍是在懷念那辛酸的風沙旅途？</p>
<p>那些積壓於心底的痛苦的感情，在生活的經騐中已經變得淡漠了。曾經掏出多少淚水，讓它融外，讓它消逝在記憶的河流之外。</p>
<p>不能讓過去的情感感囚鋼自己，也不能讓過去的生活重新誘惑我。我應該從痛苦的理解中，　立起生活底信念，使一切痛苦的遭遇在我底生活中變為力量，我知道未來的路是更艱困而痛苦必定更多。</p>
<p>有人說沒有痛苦也就沒有快樂，然而我確實已把過去的痛苦忘記。如果說還有一點存留在我心裏，那祇是解說於長期禁囚後的一種愉快。這由於痛苦而發生的窒息與麻痹的心靈現象的複活，我不禁為這驕傲而又堅强的生活意念底再度燃燒感到喜悅！</p>
<p>把自己的感情從痛苦的深淵中起拔，猶如一粒種子從殘凍的泥土裏抽出芽來。從此生命開始有新的希望與鼓舞，但從此生命也將遭受更多的摧殘與考騐。因而我必須更淸醒地睜開我底限睛去探視一下這遼闊的世界，讓自己底生活安排在現實上，去迎接更多的痛苦！</p>
<p>有如被踐踏了的野草似的不絕生長，蔓延，却不要以過多的夢幻，使生命底泉源涸竭，因為從現實到未來，該有一段痛苦的旅程，而明天的步子，決不會跨達邈遠的喜悅中！</p>

<p>當熊校長宣布萬家寳先生出席我們的第一次文藝晚會，並且答應講演「美國現代劇壇」的時候，座中起了一陣子興奮的騷動，大家很熱切的盼望三月九日晚上七時這個時日的來臨。</p>
<p>「樑上君子」日塲觀衆陸續散出來，大家動手佈置文藝晚會的會塲，搞燈光的同志，把司包脫照耀得全塲雪亮，幷且打了一個光暈在主席台上。</p>
<p>好些法學院和光華大學的愛好戲劇的同學，聞訊趕來參加，做了不速之客。</p>
<p>萬家寳先生在春雷嗚響似的掌聲中到臨，他淸秀而瘦弱，使人聯想到弱不禁風的中國文人，他穿着灰棉布的長袍，棉襖袖子比袍子長出一寸，柔軟的頭髮自然地在左側分開，架着一付金絲眼鏡，閃着有力的慧眼，使人覺得他的洞徹力的深入：勃子上圍了一條紫紅色圍巾，給你一種不修褊幅底瀟洒的印象。</p>
<p>他教書熱情，常當忘記下課，他說他自已缺乏集中力，事實上，也許為了他的思考太過集中的緣故，下課的鐘聲，沒有一次為他注意過。他教書的時候，眼睛照例不看聽衆，好像故意閃避着你的目光，有時用手撫摸着他的鬢髮，露出羞澀的表情。</p>
<p>當熊先生說及，給你們不上萬先生課的同學，瞻仰瞻仰萬先生丰采的時候，引起嘹亮的笑聲。熊先生說連他自己在內，目前中國寫戲的人沒有一個趕得上萬先生的成就者，並盛讚他的創作態度的嚴肅：他的作品不發表則已，一發表必驚人。</p>
<p>萬先生向鼓掌的聽衆頷首示意，開首說：對熊先生的推獎，不敢承受；接着說：說我寫得慢，對了，說我「嚴肅」，深愧還沒有做到。而且他又自歉缺乏集中力。</p>
<p>言歸正傳，他談到美國劇壇，要點如下：（一）說美國戲劇完全商業化，據他實際考察，未盡公允，美國有許多進步作家，進步劇本也有上演的機會，一般演出都在水準以上，那些化錢的大老闆，不大理會戲的內容；（二）美國戲劇眞正可以買錢的地方並不多，主要的依菲「大衆劇塲」，它擁有一百萬會員，略如中國平劇的票房；它供給導演，供給院子，供給演員，不但培養了人民觀劇的興趣，而且訓練了不少新的人材出來，成為美國劇壇的重要支柱；（三）美國職業寫劇人，有兩種能度：一種是消極的不承認好萊塢戲劇，他們自認目前在好萊塢工作，不過為了「淘金」，等到袋裏裝滿了，再寫「他們想寫的東西」；一種是積極的民衆教育者，他們無情的暴露，正確的啓示，可以奧達次為代表；（四）他認為不論美國作家有些個意識不正確，但是他們扶巧之好，和觀察力之透徹，非中國劇作家所可企及；（五）美國正在推行一種「保留制劇院」，力糾一個戲連演幾年之失—它使得新進的人無法上進，使得職業劇久成為一種商品；這個戲院制度樹立後，可以儘挑一些好的戲來演，去年這些劇院曾上演過莎士比亞的，蕭翁的柴霍夫的·易卜生的·巴雷的戲。</p>
<p>他結束了他的講詞，同學們報之以熱烈的掌聲。餘興的節目開始，等到上咖啡的時候，大家才聽到就寢鈴已經大作，在主席宣布散會後，猶自咀嚼著萬先生的講演。</p>
<h3>花鳥</h3>
<p>— 指畫</p>
<h3>談詩</h3>
<p>— 杰人</p>
<p>意境旣然模糊，典型倘亦虛幻，則詩的靈魂和骨子所繫皆無形喪失；世界上能產生下偉大的詩篇，都發源於一個簡單樸質的中心思想，結成最有力的故事，同時精密具體地表現出來的。而一首的顯示原該像一個巨人的站立和一泓海水似得深邊遼闊，令人可以提摸，欣賞，即使是最短的不到一二行的詩篇，也應該具備一個完聲的個體才是。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血198</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「可惜…」我這時觸到另一稱感想；也許就是那個「八」的秘密還沒有獲到滿意的解答，很想從萍子口裏探聽一個明白。有了這個感想，不覺衝口說了「可惜」兩個字，意思說「可惜無法當面向萍子探問一下；只要她肯坦白公開的話」。</p>
<p>「什麼」？w君問我，意思說「可借什麽」？</p>
<p>我把感想到的意念告訴了w君。我說話的口氣裏，表示鶴見和萍子也許正在討論這個問題，可惜無法聽到。</p>
<p>「可惜」！君也這麽來了一個歎詞；「鶴見是我們的朋友，他站在比我們還艱難十倍百倍的崗位上工作，奮鬥。敬佩是不必說的；我們應當竭盡所有的力量，給他便利，工作上的便利，絕對不應當刺戟他的感情；當面或背地都應當鼓勵他，不能給他一絲一毫的打擊，無論在言語或行動上。不然的話…」</p>
<p>w若說到這裏，忽然頓住。他這幾句話，前一段我很明瞭，後面這兩句，雖也懂得，却不明瞭他意旨所在。為什麽要說這兩句話？為什麼又有最後這一轉「不然…」？</p>
<p>「不然的話…」我意思想請w君說下去。但同時猛然觸機，明白了w君的意旨，—「不然的話，僅須指頭一撥，就可聽見他們在說什麽了—便會心的點着頭，「我明白了…但是沒有關係。這件事我可以幹，只不知道現在使用這個裝置，方便不方便」？這個「裝置」，指着「傳聲裝置」。開了這個裝置的電鎚，我們就可以聽見鶴見和萍子的談話。</p>
<p>「方便的話，不成問題…不過…」w君攢　了眉尖，好像有些礙難說明的痛苦，還滲有幾分不願意的決心。</p>
<p>我知這w君不願探聽鶴見和萍子談話，因恐有傷鶴見的感情，怕他後來知道了這事，因此受刺　。在我却無所謂。鶴見和我，知無不言，言燕不盡。他和萍子談話，始終必要告訴我。就是他不願自動說明，我也可以問他一個海乾河涸。W君究竟和鵲見隔着一層。我於是決定親自動手了。</p>
<p>w君這屋子裏的裝置，我因這幾天的盤桓，大部分都摸熟了。只這「傳聲」一項，因未曾見他們用過，還找不到發音器在哪裏，如何啓用，也不知道電鍵的所在。</p>
<p>我個人方面，雖說可以負資收聽鶴見和萍子的談話，但在決定這個思念之後，和剛要實地施行之前，這一霎距離間，良知上也泛起了一個莫明其妙的「？」符號。</p>
<p>特務和偵探之類的工作，一般社會上，某一部分的人最不歡迎，甚而憎惡：憎惡他們喜歡探聽人家的私隱或「秘密」。照紳士派的某種「道德」講，這種行為，似乎欠些光明。我個人這時忽地動了一個莫明其妙的疑問，大概就是這種「紳士」的傳統觀念在作祟。但回頭一想「我為什麽要担任這類的工作？豈不是為了國家，為了挽回人類的慘刦，才肯捨着性命來幹這個工作的嗎？有了這樣的立塲，心胸應該很坦白；有了這坦白的心胸，又何惜犧牲一下這個　偽的「紳士觀念」？</p>

<h3>關於「商務」近况　—且報告一則喜訊</h3>
<p>— 黑星</p>
<p>「商務」的幾種雜誌，在戰前確實「　炙人口，」無論取材與內容，確夠得上水凖，而現在保存下來一直還在出版的，就祇「東方雜誌」一種。我為了要知道他們將來的出版計劃，特地又去河南路他們的總管理處，在推廣部和出版部門，得到了以下幾種値得使人高興的消息。</p>
<p>他們已在積極恢復過去所有雜誌的陣容了。比如「兒童雜誌」，他們的「新兒童世界」已決定在四月四日兒童節復刊了，主編人是沈百英先生。</p>
<p>而過去曾經蜚聲文壇的「小說月報，」現在已決定改名「文學雜誌」，由朱光潛先生主編，復刊號第一期五月間即可出書。</p>
<p>此外還有一種「學原月刊，」由學原社主福，五月中亦可出版，「教育雜誌」也在積極恢復出版中。</p>
<p>道許多該是多難。寂眞。上海出版界一個極大的喜訊！我們希望「商務」能够多多運用他們現有的資力財力，多為中國出版界出幾本有學術價値的書；因為無諭是科學，文壇，教育，在目前，是多麼荒蕪，多麼悽厲的景像呵！</p>
<p>據推廣部某負責人說，他們的「新中學文庫」，淮備三·四。五三個月內出齊，三月份的第一期書已出，以後擬準期出書。在全書出齊以前，不擬零星出售。全書共四百六十三册，預約價目為二百卅三萬六千一百八十元</p>
<p>我曾經問起他們閘北印刷廠和東方圖書館的近况。據說，現在東方圖書館已經夷為平地了，那裏已找不出過去曾經有過這樣一座巍峨大樓的痕跡。至於印刷廠，還保留着一部份，他們正交涉借住的機關遷讓。</p>
<p>東方岡書館的復興委員會，一直還繼續地工作着，他們為望總有一天，能在原來被戰火所毀的基地上，重新建起這一座學衛的宮殿！</p>
<p>他們又曾經向政府提出，要求日本賠償這一筆幾乎無可補償的損失，但直到現在為止，似乎亦不能得到確實的答覆。（下）</p>
<h3>戰時亂倫悲劇　讀豐子橙蜀道奇遇記</h3>
<p>— 旭</p>
<p>文藝春秋第四卷第二期晝師豐子愷先生的一篇蜀道奇遇記，沉痛的寫出萬惡的戰爭，其結果除了家破人亡以外，還有使人哭笑不得的副產品。</p>
<p>事實是這樣：一個中年婦人，在故鄉嫁過姓范的，生下一女名聆姐，萬惡的戰爭，使他們一家三口，從嘉興逃到衡陽。衡陽空戰，丈夫范某炸死，她遂在李俠家當傭工，范聆姐遂到某團長家充女工，衡陽大火，李俠夫婦先後輾轉入川，范嫂隨往，詎知數月後，李太太病故，遵照李太太的遺矚，范嫂成為李俠的繼室。再說聆姐在衡陽隨軍開拔至江西，後來團長陣亡，太太帶了范聆姐回到淪陷的故鄉南京，她改業在紗廠做工，一日突遇二獸兵意圖污辱，這時李俠的父親（老李）正任日本翻譯，適遇此事，抱着豪俠好義的勇氣，以自己的女兒相稱，解救了這塲悽慘的局面。詎知范聆姐自遭逢這次危險後，痛惜自己的孤苦伶仃，又深感老李的英勇義俠，常餽贈老李禮物，藉以答謝。後來得知李老鰥居，便起依托終身之念，不久就做了李俠的繼母。待後老李應兒子之召人川，相見後遂演成了道椿哭笑不得的父子母女夫婦的親屬關係！</p>
<p>「先就范嫂說：她的丈夫同時又是他的外孫，她的公公同時又時她的女婿；好的女兒同時又是她的繼婆婆；就聆姐說：她的丈夫同時又是他的祖父；她的前房兒子同時又是她的繼父；她的母親同時又是她的媳婦。再就李老說；牠的兒子同時又是他的岳父；他的妻同時又是他的孫女；他的岳母同時又是他的媳婦。最後就李俠說：他的妻同時又是他的外婆；他的繼母同時又是他的拖女兒；他的父親同時又是他的女婿。」</p>
<p>這是多麽沉痛的亂倫的悲劇！</p>
<h3>「神乎其技」</h3>
<p>— 魯愁</p>
<p>記得，戰前，我國南洋兄弟烟草公司的白金龍等正交鴻運時；國外的資本王義者竟以加倍的資金六千萬，和國烟背城一戰；不但廣告上遇地出現了「還是她好」的哈德門美女晝，不但他們不惜成本地將哈德門無條件地贈送；而且還大量收買白金龍，待發霉後，再秘密運向市塲。於是哈德門便繼白金龍而首屈一指了。國烟頃刻下了台。</p>
<p>又如，日本這個倔强愛國，富於摩彷創造的民族，但在打字機的業務上，也不禁被美國人隊去不知多少的錢。事實更可發人深省，當初日本人是死也不肯以自己的錢去購買別國人的東西的，然而終於在美人的無條件獎金給日人的紀錄聖手的好印象及日本抄寫聖手之公開比賽不上打字機的廣告宣傳下，東京打字機的購者，於是竟便規之若驚了。</p>
<p>新聞事業的與日發展，同時廣告術也便日益地出奇制勝，神秘莫測了。尤其在美國這個資本主義最具體化了的國家。</p>
<p>他們這批資本家，曾為爭吹牙刷的彎曲及挺眞，爭道汽車踏板的位置於內外問題而大打其廣告官司，筆墨官司也顧不得在鼓吹安眠藥的功能下，而道自己的妻子本來不肯與人同睡的，現竟不拒於任何陌生人了，只要參觀過廣告公司，只要承領過美麗的女招待員的情的，你終可明白，「廣告」是如何在為資太主義作帮閒的席子上忝居了，最重要的坐位的原委。</p>
<p>廣告配合了市儈式的陰謀，廣告形成了資本主義社會的帮閒，帮兇。資本王義愈到峯頂，廣告術也便「一鳴驚人」得「共嘆觀止」了。</p>

<h3>魚的生活</h3>
<p>— 李黎</p>
<p>飛蛾，靑娃，螃蟹，以及蛇，都愛光，看見了亮光，就想接近；飛娥尤其厲害，向燈火猛撲，甚至燒殘了翅兒，如果能飛起，則仍向火撲去；青蛙和螃蟹，見了燈光，起先是站住不動，而後靑蛙經輕跳來，螃蟹慢慢爬來；至於蛇，如果君見了燈光，就會迅捷地游行，追隨着燈光走。</p>
<p>水中的饅及其他的魚也愛燈光；在春末夏初，靑蛙深夜怒鳴，我們可以提了燈，沿水面去捕捉；當靑蛙見了亮光，不跳不逃，魚兒浮游，接近水面，也不逃逸，鰻魚隨着燈光的移動，而曲折浮游。</p>
<p>動物學家告訴我們說「魚的目光不很好，在水中祇能看到二三尺的距離，要是一旦離水，那就完全盲目，一無所見；同時，有的深水魚，就是在水中，也完全盲目，因為環境黝黑，目力因此逐漸衰退，逐漸消失。」</p>
<p>魚的目力旣不很强，那麽對於目力不及的相當距離內的危險，如何戒備呢？水的波動，使牠起一種警覺，而高速度地奔馳起來；我們在捕魚的當兒，時常用長竹竿去敲水，使水起着極大的波動，而魚就開始奔跑，以致自行衝入網中；你在西邊敲，牠就向東逃，反之，你在東邊敲，牠就向西逃，有時，魚兒已奔入網中，如果你起網太快，以致你鈑網的水，波動得更厲害，而這魚就反跳出去；魚兒的這種動作，漁夫們呌做「回綱」。</p>
<p>魚兒在急流中，總是逆流而游，如果力弱給急流緬轉，　流而下，可是一刻兒後，又努力掙扎，掉轉身來，逆流而游，這是什麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>因為魚兒運用鰓瓣以營呼吸，呼吸時，總是一開一闔，水從口入，鐲蓋開時則流出；假定順着急流而游，那麽，總蓋給水　得合不攏來，以致呼吸困難；假定逆流而游，那麼水從口入，復從鰓出，上述的道種困難，就會完全避免，而無所苦。</p>
<h3>步虛詞—火燒哈同家廟</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>妙絕哈同廟祀，哀哉愛儷園存，財翁死未帶分文，遺產紛紛爭狠！</p>
<p>那曉火神菩薩，竟欺猶太商人？可憐生死作遊魂，廟也幾成灰燼！</p>
<p>魚，大都是愛羣居的，我們在夏天的早晨，每見羣魚出遊，大的在後，小的在前，大的在土，小的在下，就是在受驚而逃的時候，也仍保持着這種程序，不會紊亂。</p>
<p>魚，因為減少水的阻力，同時也因從敵人手中易於脫逃，所以滿身分泌着滑膩的涎，尤其是鰻和鰭，格外滑潤。</p>
<p>魚，大都成爲梭形。海勸時，頭向前衝，易於破水，而滅少了水的阻力。</p>
<p>近海的魚，在交配時期，雄的追逐雌的，而成了羣游，甚至綿亘數海里，這機會給予漁夫們以莫大的便利，張網佇魚，必滿載以歸。</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>
<p>三月十六日下午三時上海美術界舉行首次茶會，到處文，鄭午昌，張聿光，吳靑霞等百餘人，並有各種餘興，下次籌備人確定汪亞廣，徐蔚南等。</p>
<p>天津大公報「文藝往來」欄內，上月杪曾有評介「文藝春秋」的文字，盛讀內容充實，印刷精良，編排活潑，是平津一帶文藝靑年的惟一精神食糧。</p>
<p>小說家SY，近仍執教成都四川大學，其近著「水滸外傳」，曾上演，頗得好評。惟作者不滿意原作，正改寫中。</p>
<h3>連日火災多</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>自從武定路大火以來，火神似乎愛上了上海，竟然總戀不捨，如果套用某前輩的筆法來說，那末我們是談「火」色變，而火神却惹壓當自己，偏偏跟我們打得「火」熱了。</p>
<p>正如對一切現象理論家都找到前因後果一樣，對於火災如此之多，我們自然也有話可說。第一是天氣太燥了；第二是房屋建築可燃的原料太多了，如棚戶；第三是外國也有大火燒，我們似乎情有可原，到了最近，又有人發現第四個理由；囤戶囤積惹大的東西。</p>
<p>例如各報所載，十五日淸晨，四川中路英商元芳洋行堆棧四樓起火燃燒。四樓是同豐食油雜貨號所租，因而「一經着火，不可收拾。」結果除了該號所堆的食油和　類等物全部焚燬以外，還將另一商號所堆的藥材亦付之一炬。此時火神尙不甘休，又延燒了三樓某烟廠所堆的烟葉。</p>
<p>食油，麻類，藥材，烟葉，都是易燒的東西，火災之來，眞是「良有以也。」難解的是二樓還有一個柴油堆棧，却「幸未波及。」如果易燃的東西都有引起火災的可能，那末除非柴油忽然變成了水，是沒有倖免的理由的。</p>
<p>這些易燒的東西應該放在那襄是好呢？難這都應該浸在水裏不成麼？</p>
<p>對於上面所載的這個火訊，某報在前面加了一個題目：「連日火災多。」然而連日的天氣，却並不太燥。所燒的地方，又不　是棚戶。而這幾天外國也沒有大火燒的消息傳來。我想在不久以後，一定有理論家出現，他們自會想出更新的理由來的吧。</p>
<h3>危城季</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>她點點頭，但並不就站起來走，在徐紹明跨進了飯之後，又過了一刻鐘模樣，才從一陣孩子的天眞的笑聲裏，走進了這一位內心大受刺激的年靑的母親。她的兩條手分左右擼着兩個怪活潑的孩子，左邊一個比較高一些，是女的；右邊一個不過四五歳模樣是男的。</p>
<p>徐家這一間因為受了逃難的影響而顯得很零亂蕭索的餐聽裏，經這兩個孩子一跳進來，立刻就添一番生意。</p>
<p>老祝也恢復了嬉皮笑臉的故態，忙着給孩子們安排座位，一面逗他們歡笑，一而詢問他們的名字。</p>
<p>「大的呌緝緋，小的呌榮兒。」關告訴他。</p>
<p>一頓飯吃得很歡暢。徐紹明對於吃原是最講究的，菜堆滿了一桌子，並且都很精緻。他熱烈地勸他的客人們喝酒吃菜，老祝伴他喝了四杯茅台，緋緋榮兒都吃了許多菜，唯有那少婦的反響仍然很冷靜，而且有些嚴備，使徐紹明感到凜然不安。後來爽快不再招呼她了，儘和老祝喝酒說笑。</p>
<p>老祝看他有了四五分醉意，忽然裝得很鄭重地向他說：</p>
<p>「告訴你，老徐，金小姐跟小沈　　了！現在就住在我們劇團裏，想跟我們一起走。」</p>
<p>這幾句話的魔力可眞不小，徐胖子立刻放下酒杯，滿面歡笑，透出躍躍欲試的神氣。</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？」他稍微還有些懷疑。「小沈待金愛　實在太凶了，我也料到他們小沈待金愛麗實在太凶了，我也料到他們遲早總要鬧翻的，愛麗我們也是老朋友，前兩年在香港，我一直就跳她。這女人脾氣太好，怪可憐的。「他把身子側過一些，笑嘻嘻地君定着老祝。「她如果要走的話，何必擠你們一起。你告訴她來找我好了！」</p>
<p>那少婦儘自招呼她那兩個孩子，有一些不愛聰他們現在所謂的事。</p>
<p>老視忍着笑搖頭。</p>
<p>「恐怕她不會願意吧！你太太尖着嗓子高呌一聲治不，連　自己也要嚇一個亡魂皆盲，金　　那兒來這個脾氣！」（十七）</p>

<h3>The Plenary Session Opens Today with Three Major Meetings to Review Politics, Military Affairs, Diplomacy, and Economy; General Chen Reports on Military Affairs at the Second Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The joint Central Memorial Week and Third Plenary Session Memorial Week were held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:15 AM this morning. President Chiang presided over the ceremony and, after leading the attendees in paying their respects, delivered an impromptu speech. He first recounted the arduous struggle of the Party over the past fifty years. He then stated that after the Party ends political tutelage and returns governance to the people, it must still shoulder the important responsibility of national construction. Therefore, he hoped that all comrades would promote Party virtue, establish mutual trust, affection, and sincerity, unite as one, and vigorously practice the Party's ideology to complete the revolution. The ceremony concluded at 9:45 AM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Third Plenary Session is scheduled to hold its third general meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th. At that time, Chairman Yu Youren will present a review of diplomacy, military affairs, politics, and the economy. The second general meeting was held at 10:15 AM on the 17th, chaired by Ju Zheng. Two hundred and sixty-two committee members were present. After the minutes of the previous meeting were read, General Chen Cheng delivered a military report, detailing the army reorganization and demobilization over the past year, as well as the communist military disturbances in various regions. He concluded his report at 11:30 AM, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] General Chen Cheng reported at the plenary session on the 17th that in the past year, under the situation of the National Army being "passively beaten," more than 130,000 communist soldiers had surrendered, and over 70,000 had been captured. This proves that the communist army has lost its self-confidence. Regarding the capture of Hao Mengling and Li Xianzhou, he said that Hao lost contact, and Li's capture was due to a failure in command. This was our negligence, not the strength of the communist army's forces. At the same time, Chen declared that the National Army's discipline was strict. In the past year, more than 50 people were sentenced to death for violating military discipline, and over 200 officers were disciplined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] General Chen Cheng reported on military affairs at the second general meeting of the plenary session on the 17th. He first explained that the Ministry of National Defense's administrative guidelines for the 35th and 36th years of the Republic (1946 and 1947) were based on the government's policy of peaceful unification: (1) accelerate demobilization work, (2) implement the army reorganization plan, (3) build up the army. The demobilization work was divided into four aspects: First, disarm the Japanese army and repatriate the Japanese; second, deal with various puppet armies; third, reward the soldiers who fought in the war of resistance and provide compensation for the officers and soldiers who died in battle; fourth, pacification work. Regarding army reorganization, it was implemented in phases according to the army reorganization plan. Since the Second Plenary Session last year, efforts have been unremitting. Fifty-seven armies have now been reorganized into fifty-seven divisions, with twenty-seven armies yet to be reorganized. Regarding army building, the quality should be improved, and the number of standing armies should be determined according to national defense needs. After the Military Affairs Commission was reorganized into the Ministry of National Defense, it has been improving its operations at any time in the past six months and paying special attention to military education, the training of the army, navy, and air force, the improvement of military supplies, the establishment of a conscription system, and the construction of barracks and fortresses, which are either underway or planned. In addition, there are two things: (1) Improvement of the lives of officers and soldiers, (2) More than 210,000 demobilized officers and soldiers have been settled, and more than 80,000 have been employed or transferred to other jobs, with more than 130,000 remaining. If it were not for the communist party's destruction of peace, affecting demobilization, all could have been completed according to the planned schedule. General Chen then explained the general situation of the communist army and the communist army's attack on the national army. General Chen finally reported that since the communist army's all-out rebellion and the national army's counter-offensive, the recovered areas, except for major cities, are approximately 200 counties. Over the past year, more than 130,000 communist soldiers have surrendered, and over 70,000 have been captured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] From 3:00 PM on the 17th, the various groups of the Third Plenary Session separately reviewed the proposals. Zhang Daofan chaired the Party Affairs Group, Chen Lifu chaired the Economic Group, Lu Zhonglin chaired the Military Affairs Group, and Bu Lizhi chaired the Diplomatic Group. The Political Review Committee did not meet; only the Political Reorganization Group met, chaired by Gu Zhenggang. The deadline for cases for the Plenary Session was noon on the 17th, and a total of 89 proposals were received, with the most being Party Affairs cases, followed by Political cases, then Economic cases. Only one proposal was received for Diplomacy and Military Affairs.</p>
<h3>"Economic Reform Plan" Enthusiastically Discussed in the Plenary Session Review Committee; Decision Not to List Tax Increase as a Separate Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The discussion of the "Economic Reform Plan" in the Economic Review Committee was very enthusiastic. Chairman Chen Lifu formed a separate subgroup to discuss the financial tax system portion and appointed Wei Daoming and Zhao Dihua as conveners of the subgroup. Moreover, the tax increase case in the proposal of the Central Standing Committee, after discussion in the Economic Review Committee, was deemed unnecessary to be listed as a separate case. It was heard that committee members Zhang Mojun and Wang Zhengting spoke several times, believing that it was not necessary to increase taxes to increase the burden on the people. The committee then decided to incorporate the case into the Economic case.</p>
<h3>Measures for Production Loans to be Submitted to the Plenary Session for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] There are widespread rumors that the government will abolish production loans. Therefore, some private factories have made requests to the government, asking to continue the program in order to subsidize production. It is learned that the government attaches great importance to this and not only has no intention of abolishing it, but is also seeking appropriate and reasonable methods to handle it. Among the economic proposals for the plenary session, it is heard that there are also proposed measures for production loans, which will be submitted to the general meeting for discussion. The draft is excerpted as follows: (1) National banks and bureaus shall handle loans to assist in the increased production of agricultural products, necessities of life, and export goods in accordance with the Economic Emergency Measures Plan regarding strengthening the financial business system. (2) After the material supply agencies and cooperative manufacturers conclude a supply contract, the national banks and bureaus may first lend up to 70% of the total order amount to the cooperative manufacturer, and the balance will be paid by the supply agency upon delivery of the goods. (3) If the cooperative manufacturer applying for a loan has not negotiated a pre-sale contract for finished products with the material supply agency, the national bank and bureau shall first notify the material supply agency to negotiate the contract. The supply contracts shall be printed with the words "supply products" and sold by merchants at 90% of the list price. For those that cannot be printed with words, the supply agency shall sell them on the market at any time to stabilize market prices. (4) Material supply agencies shall not pay deposits when ordering from such cooperative manufacturers, and the settlement methods with the national banks and bureaus shall be determined by both parties. (5) National banks and bureaus may first lend 70% of the legal currency amount converted from the foreign exchange certificate for forward exports purchased by the central bank or designated bank to the cooperative manufacturer, and the balance will be paid by the original purchasing bank or deposit bank upon delivery of the products. (6) If the exporter applying for a loan has not completed the sale of forward foreign exchange to the bank (or designated bank), the national bank and bureau shall notify the central bank to negotiate the purchase of its forward foreign exchange and then grant the loan according to the sixth regulation. (7) The settlement methods between the central bank and the lending banks and bureaus shall be determined by both parties. (8) All of the above loans shall be opened in current deposit accounts in the respective national banks and bureaus, and the cooperative manufacturers may withdraw them at any time with a headed check.

<h3>Financial Policy Innovation Requires Further Restructuring of Institutions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The "Economic Reform Plan," an economic proposal for the Plenary Session, was drafted by Chen Lifu of the Central Economic Policy Research Committee. Its content believes that financial institutions must be fundamentally reorganized, and financial policies must be comprehensively innovated. The key points of the innovation are to promote the capitalization and production of assets. The key points of the fundamental policies are as follows: (1) The loan interest rate of national banks can be temporarily set at a relatively high statutory amount for deposit and loan interest rates in order to absorb idle funds for production. (2) National banks should provide low-interest loans to legitimate entrepreneurs and adopt an order-based loan method. (3) The financial system should adjust its structure. The financial system depends on the economic system, and the economic system is the material foundation of the political system. The three are interconnected. (4) Establish county banks to absorb deposits. (5) Financing for transportation, industrial, and mining enterprises, as well as domestic industrial remittances and discounts, shall be exclusively operated by the Bank of Communications, and the National Bank shall be responsible for foreign trade.</p>

<h3>Party Affairs During the Constitutional Era: County-level Party Headquarters Should Be the Focus of Organization, and Democratic Practices Should Be Implemented in Work</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The plenary session has a detailed plan for the review and reform of party affairs, in the form of a proposal titled "Party Affairs Guidelines for the Current Stage," divided into (1) Review of the Past, (2) Current Tasks, (3) Paths to Reform, (4) Work of Reform, etc. The main points are as follows: First, it states that to implement doctrine, it is necessary to study and promote it, so a thought movement should be launched to innovate and lead thought. It is resolved that to implement doctrine, there must be a strong organization, rigorous implementation of the election system, talent management, work competition, and assessment regulations to eliminate opportunists, wavering elements, corrupt elements, and deteriorating elements at any time, in order to ensure the purity of party membership. Regarding the composition of the party organization, it is believed that it should be based on agriculture and industry. The party's working methods, whether in organization, training, propaganda, or mass movements, must eliminate bureaucratic practices, promote revolutionary style, and rigorously implement democratic style. Finally, regarding the party's structure, it is said that it has always suffered from the defect of being top-heavy and bottom-light, like an inverted pyramid, resulting in an unreasonable distribution of manpower and financial resources. During the constitutional era, local autonomy should follow Sun Yat-sen's teaching that "local autonomous bodies are not only political organizations but also economic organizations." Local autonomy should be based on the county as a unit, so the party should focus on the county-level party headquarters for organizational purposes, thoroughly reforming it so that it can shoulder the tasks of the new era. Also, in the review meeting on the 17th, the relationship between the party and the youth league was discussed.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reaffirmation of an Open Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Amidst the turbulent international situation of today, especially with the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference convened in Moscow, and at a time when the tension of the Soviet Foreign Minister's proposal to discuss the situation in China is gradually subsiding but the lingering haze has not yet cleared, we welcome the report made by Foreign Minister Wang to the Third Plenary Session. At this time, the people of the whole country hope that our diplomatic authorities can clarify the current international situation and our foreign policy. Now, the report made by Foreign Minister Wang to the Third Plenary Session can at least partially console the hope of the people of the whole country. According to reports, this report can be divided into two parts: one is the written report submitted by Foreign Minister Wang to the Third Plenary Session, and the other is the oral report made by Foreign Minister Wang at the Third Plenary Session on the 16th. According to news agency reports, the oral report is only a supplement to the written report submitted by Foreign Minister Wang to the Third Plenary Session. Since this written report has not been published, we have no way of knowing its content; and the oral report of Foreign Minister Wang published in the newspapers, with only fragmentary information, may not be the full truth. But based on news reports, we can already glimpse a clear outline of our foreign policy. From the oral diplomatic report made by Foreign Minister Wang at the Third Plenary Session, as transmitted by news agencies and published in newspapers, it is not difficult for us to understand the diplomatic policy currently held by the government.</p>
<p>This oral diplomatic report made by Foreign Minister Wang at the Third Plenary Session is straightforward and frank, fully demonstrating our national spirit of believing in love and peace. According to news reports, the foreign policy of our country as clarified by Foreign Minister Wang can be summarized as follows: "That is, to uphold and support the United Nations organization, maintain traditional friendship with the United States, strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty with the Soviet Union, and not take revenge on Japan, but seek full guarantees in the military field to prevent it from invading again." In these few words, the main parts of our country's foreign policy have been explained without omission: our way of establishing the country based on trustworthiness, love, justice, and peace can be seen here. From the perspective of world peace, a strong international organization is necessary. The weakness and powerlessness of international organizations is a major factor leading to this world war. Now that the long period of bloodshed and war has ended, we do not want to see the recurrence of war, and we must do everything possible to support the development of the United Nations, this international organization; only when this organization has power and ability can mankind be spared the misfortune of another war. The oral diplomatic report of Foreign Minister Wang mentioned first and foremost the upholding and supporting of the United Nations organization, which shows the correctness of the path we have taken for the reconstruction of lasting world peace. We should not forget that after the September 18th Incident, the League of Nations was weak and powerless in handling the Northeast incident in our country, which eventually led to the Lugouqiao Incident and triggered the full-scale war of resistance in our country, leading to the outbreak of the Second World War. Having been taught by this painful experience, we have a personal feeling for upholding and supporting the development of a strong and powerful United Nations organization. Therefore, we feel that the restrictions on the use of the veto power, as mentioned by Foreign Minister Wang, and the establishment of the armed forces for the security of the United Nations organization for the maintenance of world peace, are indeed necessary.</p>
<p>Speaking of Sino-American relations, China and the United States face each other across the Pacific Ocean, and their national ideals are somewhat similar: there is a traditional friendship between China and the United States. This traditional friendship has been further solidified by the baptism of blood due to the outbreak of the Pacific War. The depth of mutual concern and affection between the people of China and the United States goes without saying. We regret that in recent times, a small number of people, with ulterior motives, have launched a so-called anti-American movement in China. This movement has other effects and cannot be said to be a spontaneous movement of the Chinese people, and even more cannot be used to represent the general intentions of the Chinese people. This newspaper has repeatedly written articles to explain this. Now that our Foreign Minister has clarified our policy on Sino-American relations, summarizing it into the eight characters "maintain traditional friendship with the United States," we, standing in the position of the people, are even more willing to add: we not only want to "maintain traditional friendship with the United States," but also hope to "increase" it, so that the traditional friendship between China and the United States can become more and more solid.</p>
<p>As for our relations with the Soviet Union, China and the Soviet Union are neighbors, and the length of their border is unmatched in the world. We cherish the friendship of the Soviet Union; therefore, we did not hesitate to give up part of our sovereignty and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Since this treaty has been signed, we have the obligation to abide by it in good faith, and the other party also has the obligation to faithfully fulfill it. Foreign Minister Wang's "strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty with the Soviet Union" is a manifestation of our commitment to international integrity and is unanimously supported by the people of the whole country. The Chinese people judge the domestic Communist Party issue and the foreign relations with the Soviet Union as two separate matters. The Chinese Communist Party issue is a domestic issue, and the attitude towards handling this issue does not involve the attitude towards Sino-Soviet relations. The Chinese people admire the Soviet Union's efforts to build the country and its heroic fight against Hitler. We cherish the friendship of our great neighbor, and we hope that the relationship between the two countries, based on the new relationship of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, can grow and develop even more in the future.</p>
<p>The non-retaliatory policy towards Japan is another noble expression of our national spirit based on benevolence. This policy has received unanimous support from the people of the whole country. There is something that we must mention here, which is the attitude towards other ethnic groups in Asia; this may not have been mentioned in Foreign Minister Wang's report, but we feel that this is the most important part of our foreign policy. China and India, Siam and other countries have exchanged ambassadors, and have established diplomatic relations and sent envoys to the Philippines, Persia, Afghanistan and other countries: in addition, other ethnic groups in Asia have also been moving in the direction of independence and autonomy; among them, the independence of Burma will soon be seen in fact. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify our policy towards the ethnic groups in Asia. Korea is separated from our country by the Yalu River, and we are naturally particularly concerned about its welfare; how to eliminate the artificial division of Korea, and see reunification again, we and Korea are as close as brothers, how can we not make efforts? Furthermore, India has convened the so-called Pan-Asian Conference, although this is a civil gathering, it seems to be somewhat of a "diplomatic offensive." As an Asian country and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, we should have the significance of representing and leading the ethnic groups in Asia. We hope that the diplomatic authorities can continue to clarify this point, which will be enough to refresh the world.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Advocates Supporting Japan, Emphasizes that a Peace Treaty with Japan Should Be Concluded as Soon as Possible to Expedite the End of the Military Occupation</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur made an important statement to the press corps today, saying: After the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan should not continue to be controlled by force, and the headquarters should be abolished immediately. Judging from the current world situation, the day to begin discussing the peace treaty is ripe. After the treaty is issued, the conditions stipulated in the treaty should be supervised by the United Nations. The reason for the existence of the United Nations lies in this. If the United Nations cannot lead Japan in the post-war world, its organization is meaningless. The United Nations is currently facing important economic problems. Japan's production must be increased to the extent that it can maintain the minimum living standards of the Japanese people. Japan must be rebuilt as a commercial country engaged in import and export trade. Japan's national borders delimited after the war are not enough to meet the food needs of the Republic of China. Japan's arable land has the highest unit area productivity in the world, but it is not enough to support the tens of millions of people in the narrow territory after the war. Therefore, we must allow Japan to engage in foreign trade, and this trade must be carried out by the private sector, and the government's control should be suppressed to the minimum. Some people think that Japan should be economically isolated for fifty years. This kind of opinion is not correct. Regarding the issue of compensation, Japan has lost Manchuria, Korea, and Taiwan, and has paid a huge price. Japan has invested billions of dollars in these places and imported the necessary food from these places. Regarding the reconciliation with Japan, it is unfortunate that the opinions among the United Nations have not yet been unified. Japan has abolished its army and abandoned war, which is commendable. Japan's current economic situation has been extremely exhausted due to the war. If economic blockade is continued, it will increase the burden on the United States, because the United States is the only country that can supply the necessary food to Japan. In order to rebuild export trade, Japan's textile industry must be expanded immediately, and cotton must be imported from the United States, and wool sweaters must be imported from Australia. Japan's compensation and trade control must have some flexibility, because the purpose of compensation is to destroy Japan's war capability, not to destroy Japan's ability to survive.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur advocated the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, and said: After the establishment of the treaty, the Allied countries should no longer have troops stationed in Japan, otherwise the treaty will be useless. Asked whether the United States will lend loans to Japan, MacArthur replied that Japan not only has the ability to pay loans, but is also eager to pay debts. As far as its military and political situation is concerned, the work of removing military equipment has now been completed in both material and spiritual aspects, and its combat potential has been completely destroyed, and it has also learned the lesson that combat is not worth the loss. This can indeed be called the greatest revolutionary spirit in the world. At the same time, Japan's old myths and feudal traditions have also disappeared, tending towards individual freedom. I am not saying that democratic politics has been completed. Democratic politics must seek its gradual development before it can be realized.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur said: Japan should start paying for the credit loans borrowed from the United States immediately after the establishment of the treaty. Subsequent loans to Japan should be lent to private companies in a private capacity in order to revive Japan's private economic system.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers Conference Enters Second Week, Economy is the Focus of Discussion, US Plans for German Provisional Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 17th] The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference continues to be in a stalemate, discussing the procedure for the peace treaty with Germany and the military issues in the German-Austrian peace treaty. The two sub-group meetings are chaired by the United States' Murphy and Clarke. The Foreign Ministers Conference is also scheduled to meet at 4 pm, at which time Marshall will present his plan for the economic unification of Germany and the establishment of a provisional German government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 17th] The US delegation has completed a detailed plan for the establishment of a provisional German government based on the economic unification plan, and submitted it to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference today. The plan states that the United States does not believe that German economic unification can achieve a consistent and fully self-sufficient basis without the emergence of a German central government. From the point of view of US Secretary of State Marshall, the provisional German government he envisioned is based on the local governments of the German states.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper news] London 17th broadcast: There are many military figures in the US delegation to the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, and Truman's speech calling for aid to Greece and Turkey made the Soviet authorities feel the strong posture of the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] If there is no sudden change in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the four Foreign Ministers will begin to discuss the report of the Allied Control Council on economic principles at the beginning of the second week of the conference. It is generally believed that this part of the report is one of the most important and complex chapters, with a total of eleven items, namely: (1) Industrial standards; (2) Clearing of war industry power; (3) Food rationing; (4) Agriculture; (5) Dissolution of trusts; (6) Imports and exports; (7) Domestic trade; (8) Economic unification; (9) Transportation; (10) Financial bank and financial reform; (11) Transfer of German and Allied property. The key to the overall situation is of course the economic unification issue in item 8. If the four powers can reach an agreement on this point, the consistency of the four powers' actions in Germany can be simplified a lot. British Foreign Secretary Bevin has clearly pointed out that the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement on the German part depends on whether economic unification can be achieved. Without economic unification, political unification is just a fantasy. Although the four powers currently support the principle of economic unification, their policies are different and difficult to match each other. It is expected that the prerequisite that the United Kingdom will propose is to allow the unrestricted free exchange of materials in various regions, otherwise economic unification will never be able to fulfill its purpose.</p>
<h3>Facing Difficulties, the Key to Success or Failure</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 16th] The delegations of various countries expect that next week will be the most urgent class of the meeting. Economic unification and compensation issues are considered to be the difficulties of the German issue. The above two issues are related to every other part of the German situation. If these issues can reach an agreement, then other issues are secondary and easy to solve. Otherwise, other issues cannot be resolved. According to a major representative, it is unlikely that an agreement will be reached next week on the German compensation and economic unification issues, but at the end of the economic negotiations, it will be possible to discover whether there is an opportunity for a compromise in this meeting. Whether or not people can spend another week or more to reach common principles. At the end of this week, if it falls into a stalemate, then as far as the German issue is concerned, we can give up women, at least at this meeting.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] Moscow Radio's English commentator "Analyst" said: Truman's declaration of aid to Greece and Turkey.

Greece and Turkey are now ruled by reactionary governments, and they are abusing oppression against those who resisted Germany. Truman wants to supply these two governments with American gold yuan so that they can add weapons to suppress the country and prepare to invade foreign countries. Judging from the fact that Czechoslovakia's request for reconstruction loans was rejected by the United States, Truman's intentions are self-evident.</p>
<h3>Report that the US Intends to Lend a Huge Sum to the Soviet Union to Urge it to Change its Expansionist Policy, Otherwise the US Will Expand Aid to Eastern Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] According to Washington sources, local newspapers report that the United States may grant a substantial loan to the Soviet Union if it changes its policy of expanding its influence.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Former US Undersecretary of State Welles, a fervent supporter of the United Nations, declared in his weekly broadcast today: "The United Nations is not yet prepared to prevent Soviet imperialism from developing in the Middle East. The inevitable path to destroying the United Nations and causing war between the United States and the Soviet Union is for the United States to delay and mislead itself, allowing the Soviet Union to rapidly expand its control over Western Europe, the Mediterranean, and Central Europe." Welles also said that if this issue is submitted to the United Nations for resolution, even after some time of negotiation in the Security Council, there is likely to be no opportunity for agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Alaska Under Soviet Attention</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Republican Congressman Gearhart told reporters today that the Soviet Union is paying close attention to Alaska.

It is reported that the content of the second note is divided into three points: first, providing evidence for the accusation in the first note that the Soviet Union illegally interfered in Hungary's internal affairs; second, warning the Soviet Union not to take retaliatory action against the leaders of the Smallholders Party on the grounds that they allegedly plotted against the Soviet occupying forces; and third, explaining that the statements of some Smallholders Party members were inspired by pressure from Soviet officials or Hungarian Communists.

<h3>Security Council Discusses Three Important Cases, Soviet Attitude is Extremely Notable, the US Opposes Any Amendments to the Trusteeship Plan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 16th] After the decision of the United States to step into the Balkans, attention is now focused on Soviet representative Gromyko, in order to glimpse the policy adopted by the Soviet Union within the United Nations organization. In the next few days, Gromyko has three major opportunities to speak, which are sufficient to show the Soviet Union's new position. On the 17th, the Security Council will continue to debate the issue of trusteeship of the Pacific Islands. On the 19th, the Atomic Energy Commission will re-discuss the international control report, with Gromyko as chairman. In addition, the Security Council may meet on the 18th to discuss the report on the British accusation of Albania laying mines. Observers believe that although the above-mentioned points are outside the scope of the Balkan issue, the Soviet Union will not hesitate to elaborate on its policy in these troubled times. For example, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was convened to discuss the German issue, but in the first meeting, the Soviet Union raised the Chinese issue. Judging from the attitude of the Moscow government's newspapers, it is still difficult to predict whether Gromyko will condemn the United States for providing assistance to Greece and Turkey without going through the United Nations organization. The 17th Security Council is the first meeting since President Truman's speech.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] US official spokesmen said that the US will reject the three amendments of Britain and Australia when the Security Council resumes debate on the US's individual trusteeship plan for the former Japanese islands in the Pacific on the 17th.

These four countries may obtain temporary seats in the Security Council on the 17th to review the trusteeship agreement. US representative Austin claimed that the final approval of this plan has been delayed due to the impatience of Britain and its dominions and their demand for an "open door" policy. Austin said he hoped the plan could be approved before the end of this weekend.</p>

<h3>If War Breaks Out, Britain Will Move its Capital to South Africa</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chicago, 17th] The "Chicago Tribune" said that officials from the State Department and the military told some senators that the British government is drafting a plan to move its capital to South Africa in the event of the next war, and to move British heavy industry there as well. The development of rocket bombs after the war has made their power more than ten times greater than the bombs used in this war, and they can destroy the British Isles overnight, making them unable to be used as military bases. The trip of the British King and others to South Africa is also one of the reasons, as it is intended to strengthen the unity of the Empire. The reason for choosing South Africa instead of Canada is that South Africa has a better climate and is farther away from Soviet bases.</p>

Some people oppose holding negotiations with General Franco, while others are unwilling to link up with left-wing groups. People in the Spanish government, on the other hand, do not express concern about the Royalists' plans to restore the monarchy.</p>
<h3>Martial Law in the Holy Land is Lifted, but Terrorists are Still Very Active</h3>

<h3>Gandhi Calls for Peace, Willing to Strive to the Death</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] Gandhi is now in Bihar Province, the site of a major riot last November, studying ways to persuade people to make peace. He met with the Governor of Bihar Province yesterday. The provincial government has ordered newspapers to publish Gandhi's appeals and prayers, advising the two communities of Indians and Muslims to reconcile.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bombay, 16th] According to people close to Gandhi, Gandhi may sacrifice his life as a final effort to end the constant riots in India. Gandhi's attitude has changed from anxiety and distress to a state of "emptiness of the four elements". In the past, even in the most difficult situations, Gandhi was able to remain calm and composed, and repeatedly said that the loss of self-reliance is a sign of weakness. However, the recent riots in Ben Zhebu Province and the attitude of the Muslim leaders in Bihar Province have made the Mahatma lose his self-confidence. Gandhi said in a recent speech that he did not want to live in the world and witness the failure of his "non-violent doctrine".</p>

<h3>Whether Public Utilities Will Raise Prices Depends on the Level of Central Government Subsidies for the Final Decision</h3>
<p>The issue of increasing prices for public utilities in this city has been brewing for more than a month. However, the authorities believe that it concerns the welfare of citizens and cannot be easily decided, so it remains unresolved. According to the results of investigations by reporters with various public utility departments, the total monthly deficit amounts to a staggering 76 billion yuan. Sources involved also indicate that whether or not public utility prices will rise, or by how much, depends on the central government's decision on the amount of subsidies and whether the subsidies are given to the Fuel Management Committee or directly to the public utility companies. If full subsidies are provided, prices will not be increased. If only partial subsidies are provided, the increase will depend on the subsidy amount. If the price of coal supplied to the public utility departments by the Fuel Committee remains at 145,000 yuan per ton, then the subsidy should be given to the Fuel Committee. If the price of coal supplied is based on the new March price of 210,000 yuan, then the subsidy should be given to the public utility companies. The final decision depends on Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs consulting with the central government on overall planning within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Near Yangsi Bridge Town in Pudong Police Unit Engages in Combat with Bandits Bandits Armed with Automatic and Semiautomatic Weapons Eventually Repelled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A shootout between police and bandits occurred near Yangsi Bridge Town in Pudong the night before last around 9 PM. The standoff lasted until 2 AM yesterday before the bandits retreated. The situation was extremely tense. The bandits, numbering around seven, were armed with automatic and semiautomatic weapons and possessed considerable firepower. However, they were eventually repelled by the combined efforts of the Security Police Brigade stationed in the town and the officers of the South Street Police Station of the Yangsi Bridge Police Precinct. The incident began when the South Street Police Station Chief Huang Dan, following routine, led a small team of officers with Brigade Commander Hong Liang on patrol in the suburbs around 9 PM the night before last. Near the Hengda Yarn Factory behind the district office, they vaguely saw figures in the darkness and ordered them to stop for inspection. The bandits immediately opened fire on the police. Commander Hong, for self-defense, ordered his men to scatter and return fire, while Chief Huang returned to the station to urgently summon police from the brigade and all officers from the Security Police Brigade for reinforcement. By 12 AM, the bandits were forced to retreat. However, not long after, around 1:30 AM yesterday morning, the bandits returned, attempting to storm the town. Ultimately, they were no match for the police firepower and retreated completely after 2 AM. The case has been reported to the Police Headquarters by the precinct, and a search is being conducted in the direction of the bandits' retreat. It is reported that there were no casualties on either side in the engagement.</p>
<h3>Sun Huaming Guilty of Assault Resulting in Death Appeal Concluded Claimed Victims Died from Enemy Maltreatment, Lack of Food and Clothing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday heard an appeal case of assault resulting in death, involving the recruitment of Chinese laborers by the enemy during the war to work in mines in Hokkaido, without clothing or food, resulting in death from cold and starvation. Sun Huaming was accused of serving as the squad leader of the third team of the first unit of coal miners at the Hokkaido Rinsei Iron Works. Under his charge were nine workers: Lin Axiang, Wei Min, Li Jing, Xu Guangde, Yuan Liangdi, Lu Yun, Guo Zaibo, Peng Yonggen, and Zhao Yuanying, who were beaten with iron rods by Sun and died from severe injuries. After the Japanese surrendered, a fellow worker, Tu Yutang, returned to China and informed Lin Chunlin, the father of the deceased Lin Axiang. Upon learning the details, Lin reported the case to the Yangshupu Precinct of the Shanghai Police Bureau, which arrested and transferred Sun to the District Court. The District Court sentenced Sun to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life for continuous infliction of serious injury resulting in death. Sun appealed to the High Court. Yesterday, Sun argued in court that the squad leader had no authority to beat people, only the Japanese could beat people at will. The weather in Hokkaido was cold, with snow several feet deep in winter. The Japanese only provided us with six ounces of rice per day, and those who were sick and unable to work only received three ounces. The rice was mixed with bean cakes, soybean residue, radishes, and other things. No cotton clothes or wages were issued, leading to many deaths from cold and starvation. People in other squads also died, and it was not me who beat them to death. Later, two Chinese workers who returned to China on the same ship testified that the death rate was an average of 60-70 out of every 100 people, purely due to enemy maltreatment, and Sun was not at fault. After arguments by the prosecutor and defense lawyer, the court concluded the hearing and scheduled the verdict for 3 PM on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Yang Chitang and Zheng Huai Case Concluded</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Chitang, a Guangdong native, was accused of opening a printing shop at No. 7 Hongxing Lane, Xiamen Road, during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, where he printed the puppet "Youth Pictorial" hosted by Xiao Jianggu. Yang was also hired as the manager and publisher and later printed "National Air Defense Propaganda Atlas" for the puppet regime, selling it for profit. After the victory, he was reported and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of treason. The case was concluded in the High Court yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled for the morning of the 24th.</p>
<p>Zheng Huai, who had served in the puppet army, also had his case concluded in the High Court yesterday morning, with the verdict scheduled for the 24th.</p>
<h3>Library to be Established Within the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council will cooperate with the Municipal Library next week to establish a library at its new location on Tanggu Road, providing cultural services to the citizens. The name of the library will be decided after discussions between the two parties. Currently, the council is drafting a joint proposal, which will be implemented upon agreement by both parties. The Municipal Library has a large collection of books and originally planned to establish a branch in Hongkou, but it failed due to the lack of a suitable location. The Municipal Council has a building but no books, so cooperation between the two parties will solve this problem. The Municipal Library has agreed to send a portion of its pre-war books to the new library, while the council will purchase post-war publications. However, the council estimates that purchasing new books to a satisfactory level would cost 15 million yuan, which is difficult to raise at once, so it plans to purchase them gradually. In terms of funding, each party will send several personnel and bear their own expenses. Other expenses, such as water, electricity, and miscellaneous costs, will be borne by the council.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Social Bureau official Dong Jianhou was suspected of embezzlement. Yesterday, the Social Bureau sent a confidential letter to the District Prosecutor's Office requesting an investigation and ordered Dong to go to the Prosecutor's Office. Dong, initially unaware of the case, thought he was going on important official business and happily went. After signing in at the reception room, he was led to the courtroom by a bailiff and realized he was a prisoner. According to the Social Bureau's confidential letter, Dong had inspected the accounts of the Daxin Rice Shop on Anyang Road and extorted 500,000 yuan.

<h3>Yong'an No. 2 Factory Manager Accused of Occupying Land to Build Roads</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Guo Zhuozhao, the manager of Yong'an No. 2 Factory, was recently accused by Li Fugen to the District Prosecutor's Office of forcibly occupying three mu and three fen and five hao of land owned by Li in June of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) to build roads and colluding with the Japanese soldier Bing Tiancheer to falsely accuse Li of being a "思想犯" (ideological criminal). Li fortunately escaped and fled, avoiding harm. After the victory, he negotiated with Guo several times without result and attached certificates from the district chief and Bao Zhang (local security chief).

<h3>Reassessment of Rental Values in Former French Concession Postponed for Further Discussion</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The collection of house rent is based on rental values. Recently, many residents of the former French Concession have requested the Finance Bureau to re-evaluate rental values. The bureau also believes that the assessment of rental values in the former French Concession is different from that in the former International Settlement. In order to achieve uniformity, it is proposed to reassess the rental values in the area. The case was discussed at the previous municipal meeting, but due to the high cost of investigations and other expenses required for the reassessment, no conclusion was reached and it was postponed for further discussion.</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Arrest of People to be Prevented Commander Xuan Reiterates</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It has been rumored that people have been frequently arrested and gone missing in the city recently. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has repeatedly stated that it never secretly arrests people or searches residences, except for those who are issued arrest warrants and search warrants in accordance with legal procedures. Yesterday, Commander Xuan reiterated this point again at the headquarters' memorial week, saying that since the withdrawal of CCP personnel, there are indeed many secret agents, but it is illegal to unauthorized arrest people and search residences in the name of the Garrison Headquarters and such actions should be prevented. Xuan also said that no agency within the Songhu area other than the Garrison Headquarters may arrest people, or at least must contact the Garrison Headquarters. In the future, it will pay attention to unauthorized arrests by other agencies and take effective measures to prevent them.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Solemnly Declares No Special Privileges Enjoyed for Imports Importing Luxury Goods is Absurd</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Regarding reports that the Yitong Company, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China Supply Bureau are currently purchasing and importing large quantities of luxury goods, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau to understand the truth. According to the official, the bureau is a government procurement agency, founded in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), and gold is allocated by the government for its use. Because the bureau does not have a branch in the United States, all procurement matters in the United States are handled by the China Supply Committee in Washington and the New York World Trade Corporation. All imports by the bureau are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Temporary Import Management Committee, and applications for import permits are made without enjoying special privileges. The bureau solemnly denies the report by the Associated Press that it has imported luxury goods such as wireless radios and refrigerators. This can be verified with the customs. The news report also claimed that some luxury goods have been resold by government officials for profit, which is absurd. Also, at the end of the war, before the quota system was established, the bureau ordered a batch of 190 cars to meet the urgent needs of various agencies. The allocation of these cars was entirely in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, and the bureau delivered them to various government agencies at cost price and did not sell them at market prices, so there was no profit.</p>
<h3>Public Transport Insufficient by Half Private Motor Vehicles Increase Sharply Registration Procedures Difficult to Handle Director of the Fourth Bureau of Public Works Reports</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Li Yingsong, director of the Fourth Bureau of Public Works, in his report at the municipal government's memorial week yesterday: Before the war, there were a total of 65 commercial public transportation lines in the city, with 745 vehicles (including buses and trolleybuses). Although active efforts have been made to restore them after the victory, they are still one-third fewer than before the war, while the city's population has increased from more than 3 million to more than 4 million. This is the fundamental reason for the difficulty and congestion of transportation. According to transportation experts, with the city's population of 4 million, an average of 60%, or 2.4 million people, may leave home every day, and most of them rely on public transportation. Assuming that each vehicle can accommodate an average of 2,000 people, the city needs 1,000 public transportation vehicles to meet the needs, but in reality, there are only more than 500 vehicles, so crowding is inevitable. The bureau has hired American experts to come to Shanghai to study the city's transportation problems and believes that good opinions and methods will be available for adoption in the future.</p>
<p>Enemy-Puppet Vehicles Particularly Difficult to Handle</p>
<p>Due to the rapid increase in the city's population, the number of vehicles has also increased accordingly. The number of private motor vehicles has doubled compared to before, totaling more than 22,000. In addition, the number of pedicabs produced after the war has reached more than 18,080. In addition, the number of bicycles and rickshaws has also increased, making it difficult for the Bureau of Public Works to handle vehicle registration. Before the war, the Bureau of Public Works, the British and French Concession authorities handled the registration separately, but now it has been merged into one place. Moreover, after the victory, a large number of motor vehicles came to Shanghai from other ports and inland areas, among which enemy-puppet vehicles are the most difficult to handle.</p>
<p>Transfer Only Permitted with Concrete Evidence</p>
<p>According to the records of the received Puppet Construction Bureau, vehicles in the name of the enemy or puppet regime or transported from other places by the enemy army were never registered in the city. According to the administrative order, enemy-puppet vehicles sold to bona fide third parties before the enemy's surrender are considered valid, so it is extremely difficult to review them. At the time of the takeover, various parties drove vehicles to the bureau to apply for registration, and because the records had not been fully received at that time, a temporary measure was formulated to allow them to provide a guarantee and issue a permit. On the one hand, it facilitates people's transportation, and on the other hand, it avoids fleeing to other areas, but these vehicles must be allowed to transfer ownership only after providing concrete evidence.</p>
<p>General Issuance of Driver's Licenses</p>
<p>Regarding driving tests, applicants must first stamp their fingerprints with the police and designate a municipal hospital to check their qualifications before applying for the driving test. After passing the test, a license will be issued. A total of 9,908 ordinary driver's licenses, 19,786 professional driver's licenses, 8,950 learner's licenses, and 23,000 pedicab driver's licenses have been issued in the city. Twenty-two driving schools have been approved and registered.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhuchen Case Third Trial The District Court Summons Witnesses</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zhuchen's case of hiding enemy Long Island foreign firm leftover materials, the District Court yesterday summoned witnesses for the third trial. The witnesses included Wu Runsun (battalion commander of the Garrison Headquarters), Russian Romanberg (manager of Aldo Motor Company), Eparas Laskavicky (Aldo employee), former deputy director of the Putuo Road Police Station Xi Yongxi, and Fan Rongchun (director of the Central Machine Factory), the informant who had Wang hide stolen goods. Wu Runsun was questioned first. Wu was the person in charge of the Wang case during the investigation by the Clearing and Investigation Group. According to him, after Wang Zhuchen was secretly reported, he sent people to Wang's residence to conduct undercover investigations, posing as buyers of auto parts. Wang had issued a list, and the evidence was solid. This list has now been handed over to the Transportation Section of the Garrison Headquarters and can be retrieved as evidence. Aldo Motor Company Manager Romanberg and his employees all admitted to knowing Wang, but claimed that they had never heard of the crime of embezzlement of enemy property. Fan Rongchun said: I don't know Wang Zhuchen. The auto parts were introduced by Teng Yongxi to be stored. Later, an employee, Gu Dingyi, read the newspaper and reported it to the police. It is heard that the District Court attaches great importance to the case, and a collegiate panel will be formed for debate next time.</p>
<h3>Electroplating Workers Petition Misunderstanding Arises Between Labor and Management</h3>
<p>Work Distribution for Kiln Cargo Handling</p>
<p>Self-Negotiation After Mediation Fails</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] More than 70 electroplating workers went to the Social Bureau yesterday to petition, demanding that the employer restore the issuance of salaries according to the index and other four points. The Social Bureau originally scheduled a negotiation between the two parties yesterday, but the employer's representative did not arrive. The four workers' representatives took the bureau's emergency order to the trade association, but a misunderstanding arose between the two parties. The employer reported to the police, and a large number of armed personnel surrounded the scene. After some explanation, the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>Because the employer of Wujin Road Delong Tobacco Company dismissed more than 10 workers who asked for leave on the 15th of this month and did not come to the factory to work, more than 100 female workers of the factory gathered at the Social Bureau yesterday morning to petition, demanding that the factory withdraw its order.</p>
<p>The employees of Jiuchang numbers in the electric bead industry, Maocheng, Qiming, Daxin, Dahua, Daming, Huyinji, Jiangkangji, and Fengbaocheng, etc., have been on strike since the 15th because the bonus for February was not paid, and the Social Bureau is currently mediating.</p>
<p>Regarding the transportation of incoming goods in the Suzhou River kiln industry, disputes previously arose between dock workers and transportation workers. After mediation by the Social Bureau, a work distribution method was agreed upon: dock workers would handle the transportation when the goods arrived, and after a certain distance, they would be handed over to transportation workers for transportation. Afterwards, the kiln industry trade association expressed its opposition, believing that the repeated handling would easily break the bricks and tiles, resulting in large losses. Upon hearing the news, the transportation workers believed that they would have no work to do, so they once again requested the Social Bureau to mediate a few days ago. Yesterday's negotiations still failed to reach an agreement, and the two parties will now negotiate on their own outside the meeting.</p>
<p>The Social Bureau continued to convene negotiations between the two parties yesterday on the decision of the New Capital Hotel to dismiss one-third of the 275 employees, but the dismissal method has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>Coal Industry Petitions City Council to Restore Free Trade</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xie Hengchuang, Chairman of the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, and Wang Zuxun, the association's legal counsel, and seven others, submitted a petition yesterday. Mao Chunpu and Lu Qisheng, representing the group, took the letter to the City Council to request two things: (1) Please ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Management Committee to allocate 25,000 tons of various types of coal to the trade association each month at a fair price, and allow the restoration of free trade. (According to the representatives, the Fuel Management Committee has not allocated coal to the association for three months, making it impossible for coal merchants to continue operating). (2) Request that all domestic coal mines allocate a certain amount from their total output to supply the trade association members for free purchase and sale. In addition, the representatives solemnly denied the Fuel Management Committee's claim that the black market price of coal was entirely caused by the coal industry association. In addition to petitioning the Municipal Government and the City Council yesterday, the representatives will also go to Beijing to petition.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Inquiries</h3>
<p>Repeated Mortgaging</p>
<p>Yu Bieqian asks: (1) Mr. Jia owns seven rooms. In the 33rd year, he mortgaged them to Mr. Yi for 10,000 legal tender for a term of ten years. The mortgage interest was used as rent. Later, he took back two rooms and mortgaged them to others separately. Recently, Mr. Jia intends to absolutely sell the entire house to Mr. Yi, but failed. He changed to sell it to Mr. Bing, but Mr. Bing only wanted three of them and asked Mr. Yi to change the mortgage term to seven years. Mr. Yi naturally cannot agree because the mortgage term has not expired. I don't know what kind of legal protection there is? (2) If the house is absolutely sold to Mr. Bing, how should the 10,000 mortgage payment paid by Mr. Yi be handled? (3) Mr. Bing bought Mr. Jia's house. Mr. Yi still has the right to live in the house for seven years. If Mr. Bing forcibly wants to move in, how should he deal with it? (4) There is another house. Mr. Jia transfers it to Mr. Yi, and Mr. Yi continues to rent it to Mr. Bing. Mr. Yi collects rent from Mr. Bing every month as Mr. Jia's transfer interest. Now Mr. Jia directly sells it to Mr. Bing without Mr. Yi's knowledge. Mr. Bing refuses to pay the rent after occupying the house. At that time, the transfer fee in the 31st year was 10,000 pseudo currency, with a term of ten years. Also, Mr. Jia absolutely sold it to Mr. Bing before the term expired, which is unreasonable. If he seeks compensation for the transfer fee from him, what kind of ratio should be used for conversion?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) Mr. Yi mortgaged Mr. Jia's seven rooms. He also moved into the house to live, using the interest on the mortgage as rent. He has also obtained the right to lease on the mortgaged property. Afterwards, Mr. Yi complied with Mr. Jia's request and re-mortgaged two of them to others, which was originally permitted by law. As for Mr. Jia selling the entire property to Mr. Bing, his exercise of the sale based on ownership is naturally something Mr. Yi can oppose. However, the mortgage rent and lease rights already obtained by Mr. Yi will not be affected by the transfer of ownership. It will continue to exist. If Mr. Bing asks Mr. Yi to change the period from ten years to seven years, and the house from five rooms to three rooms, if Mr. Yi does not agree, he can refuse according to the law. (2) If Mr. Jia sells the house to Mr. Bing, Mr. Yi's mortgage payment can be used to clear his right to be compensated from the proceeds of the sale. (3) After Mr. Bing buys Mr. Jia's house, Mr. Yi still has a seven-year lease term, of course he can continue to exercise his rights. If Mr. Bing wants to forcibly move in, he can refuse according to the law. (4) This situation is similar to the first one, and the answer to the first one can be referred to. If Mr. Yi seeks compensation from Mr. Jia, the mortgage fee can be increased by the court according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after the Restoration.</p>
<h3>Women and Children Relief Society Wishes to Universally Save Weak Women</h3>

<h3>Kerosene Mixed with Gasoline is Extremely Easy to Cause Fires The Police Department has Strictly Prohibited it and Hopes Citizens Will Report it</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been many fires in this city due to careless use of kerosene stoves. After investigation, most of the reasons are that kerosene prices are high, and unscrupulous merchants are greedy for illegal profits, either mixing gasoline into kerosene or making artificial kerosene for sale, which leads to this situation. It is reported that artificial kerosene is made of diesel, rosin water or various mineral oils mixed with flammable liquids such as gasoline. Its combustion properties are similar to kerosene, but if it is not manufactured properly, its properties are uncertain, and it is extremely easy to cause fires when used. Kerosene mixed with gasoline has a higher flash point than ordinary kerosene. Try pouring a small amount of pure kerosene into a small iron can or porcelain dish, and lighting it with a match. It will not catch fire. If the entire matchstick is immersed in kerosene, the flame will be extinguished instead. You need to use another match to ignite the surface of the kerosene. It is not the same if it contains gasoline. If the gasoline content is 5%, it will burn about three seconds after the match is lit. If it is 10%, the entire surface will immediately catch fire when it encounters a spark, which is extremely harmful and the same as artificial gasoline. The Fire Department of the Police Department has paid close attention to this and prohibited its sale. It is hoped that all citizens will cooperate. If they find that the kerosene they have purchased is suspicious, they should immediately notify the Fire Department of the Police Department or the local branch bureau by phone so that it can be inspected and severely punished.</p>

<h3>The Yunnan Education Department Issued Three Measures to Examine the Teaching Progress of Middle Schools Ordering All Schools to Seriously Implement Them Starting This Semester</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Kunming seventeenth telegram] Wang, the head of the Yunnan Education Department, is quite serious about examining the teaching progress of provincial middle schools. Recently, the department issued the following three measures, ordering all schools to comply: (1) Reviewing the homework textbooks of each subject. Starting from this semester, the department will periodically select homework exercise textbooks for each grade in Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry to examine the teaching results of each subject, and the department will organize a special management agency to handle it. (2) Stipulating class diaries. In the past, teaching in each subject in various schools was heard to have failed to complete the course according to the standards issued by the ministry, which had a significant impact on the improvement of students' levels. In order to clearly understand the teaching progress of each grade in each school and facilitate the investigation of teaching conditions, a class diary format is specially stipulated, ordering all schools to seriously handle it and prepare it for review at the end of each semester so that it can be investigated. (3) In the past, various schools often neglected the management of student records. Since the strict control was implemented at the beginning of the last semester, the effect has been very significant. However, some schools have failed to implement it effectively. Starting from this semester, it is specifically stipulated that all new students and transfer students must submit various documents for review within one month after the start of school to prevent the abuses of skipping grades, and a special person should be designated to be responsible for registration and review to avoid negligence.</p>

<h3>Publicly Funded Student Lecture Held Yesterday at the Ministry of Education Minister Zhu Personally Presided over the Opening Ceremony and Explained the Main Points</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing seventeenth telegram] The public-funded student lecture was held at the Ministry of Education this morning. More than 150 students who passed the public-funded student examination attended. Minister Zhu personally presided over the ceremony and explained the main points of the lecture. Experts were specially invited to give special lectures and guidance as a reference for studying abroad and to explain the policy on studying abroad. In the past years, returning students have made many contributions to academic culture and national construction. Since the establishment of the National Government, some universities in China have gradually become complete and have trained many talents. It is not difficult for them to compete with universities in Europe and the West, so in terms of theory and practice, university students do not need to go abroad. Now the government's selection of students to study abroad is a policy, not a system. It is not a rigid requirement to send them every year. It will be held when necessary depending on the situation. The Ministry held the selection this time in view of the lack of university teachers after the war. The subjects are "Social Sciences" and "Natural Sciences", with equal emphasis, and also include literature and art, taking into account overall needs. The meeting adjourned at noon. The lectures began in the afternoon. The meeting will last for three weeks and will include lectures and free discussions on "Special Appointment", "Special Submission", "Domestic and Foreign Situation", and "Western Etiquette", as well as symposiums. In addition to government leaders and experts, the lecturers also include ambassadors and cultural counselors from various countries. During the lecture period, the meeting will also visit various places. It is reported that the British and American embassies will hold tea parties on a regular basis to entertain the students.</p>

<p>This Week's Mayor's Cup Football Match Qingbai Meets Youyou Donghua Faces Jewish</p>
<p>This week's football schedule was finalized and announced by the Football Committee yesterday. There are a total of four games, all of which will be played at Yiyiwei. On Saturday at 3:00 PM, the Mayor's Cup Qingbai will face Youyou. On Sunday, the Group B final will be held starting at 8:30 AM, with Qingbai B playing against the Railway. The Group A second round will start at 10:30 AM, with the Soviet Union welcoming Longjie. The Mayor's Cup semi-final will start at 3:30 PM, with Donghua facing the Jewish.</p>
<p>In the Mayor's Cup semi-final on Saturday, Qingbai will play against Youyou. Since Youyou defeated Jingwu with a score of 1-0 and Qingbai defeated the Railway with a score of 2-0 to advance to the next round. The two sides have tied twice in the league, which shows that their strength is evenly matched. However, Youyou's goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai left Shanghai for Hong Kong last week to join Sing Tao, which has undoubtedly reduced his strength. However, Qingbai lacks Wu Zhenxiang, and there is also a lack of talent to supplement the defense. Once they meet, a fierce battle is inevitable.</p>
<p>In the Group B final, Qingbai B will play against the Railway. Players from the former team, such as Zhang Renyi, Jiang Geqing, and Xu Guofu, performed well against the Railway in the Mayor's Cup last week. The latter team forced a tie with Qingbai A in the Mayor's Cup, but finally bowed their heads in the rematch, so their door strength is also not bad. This time, the Group B final is a battle for the championship, and there will be a lively performance.</p>
<p>In the Group A league, the Soviet Union will play against Longjie. In the first round, the Soviet Union defeated Longjie 9-0. This week's second meeting, Longjie intends to avenge their previous defeat and will definitely resist to the death. However, the Soviet Union's recent situation is very good. When they meet, Longjie should be careful to avoid repeating the same mistakes.</p>
<p>The regular season champion of the Mayor's Cup, Donghua, will face the dark horse Jewish in the semi-final. Since the former team has been dominating Group A this season, they have a strong ambition to win the Mayor's Cup championship. The strength of the entire team is extremely strong. The Jewish team is known as the dark horse. This time, they have invited the famous Portuguese merchant player Fu En to help, which has made their strength even more substantial. The winner will face the Soviet Union. The full schedule is noted below:</p>
<p>March 22nd (Saturday)</p>
<p>Qingbai - Youyou (Mayor's Cup) 3:00 PM Yiyiwei</p>
<p>March 23rd (Sunday)</p>
<p>Qingbai B - Railway (Group B Final) 8:30 AM Yiyiwei</p>

<h3>Although Proposals for Currency System Reform Have Been Made, Implementation Still Needs to be Discussed; Maintaining Stability is the Top Priority at Present</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, 17th] An economist told our reporter on the 17th that the main purpose of the government's current economic measures is to gradually transition the current economy from an extraordinary to a normal state. Before everything is on the right track, the government is not considering issuing new currency. Rumors that the government will change the currency system are completely unreliable. The economic reform plan proposed at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee does have a comprehensive plan for future economic measures, but there is no plan to issue new currency at present.</p>
<p>[Report] Yesterday's newspaper reported that the economic reform plan submitted for discussion at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee included a proposal to reform the currency system and establish a gold standard. When a reporter inquired about this matter with a senior official in the financial sector, he said: "I have not heard of this matter." However, since it is a proposal, it is currently just one opinion on reforming the currency system. According to his personal opinion, now is probably not the time to implement a gold standard. Whether it is suitable to adopt a gold standard in the future when reorganizing the currency system depends on the situation at that time. Otherwise, it may not achieve the expected results. He stated: "The premise of all economic and financial measures of the government is to maintain stability. Now that the new economic plan has just been promulgated, we hope that the domestic economic and financial situation will gradually stabilize. All economic measures that could cause further turmoil, such as the recent rumors of changing the exchange rate, will not be considered."</p>
<p>Furthermore, reporters interviewed several senior officials from the Central Bank and people in the financial sector. They all said that they had not heard of this matter. A senior financial official expressed his opinion: "The current currency system implemented in our country is also known as a managed foreign exchange system. Internally, the legal currency is circulated, and externally, a managed exchange system is adopted. The issuance of domestic legal currency has been somewhat inflated due to the impact of years of war, which has affected the psychology of legal currency holders. Therefore, future currency system reforms should focus on restoring people's confidence in the currency. However, for the convenience of management, when implementing the gold standard, it is not necessary to circulate metal coins. Instead, a fixed amount of substitute banknotes can be issued in proportion to the fixed amount of gold reserves. However, the amount of gold reserves and the amount of banknotes issued must be publicly announced regularly, and social organizations should be entrusted with the responsibility of supervision. However, such currency system reform is not the right time at present. Generally, it is easier to start reorganizing the currency system when fiscal revenue and expenditure are relatively close, the political environment is stable, and transportation order is restored."</p>

Because the multiples of Yong Yarn were too large, sellers were apprehensive, falling back to 2,820 yuan.

<h3>The United States Needs a Large Number of Needles</h3>
<p>[Report] According to a foreign firm in this city, a Swedish merchant told a reporter that the United States has recently telegraphed our exporters, requesting that we supply needles in large quantities. These needles were originally supplied by British and Czech merchants in the United States. Recently, due to the inability to deliver quickly, the United States is extremely short of them. Our country's production capacity is still abundant, and there is no problem with exporting in large quantities. However, American merchants are only willing to offer prices according to the limits traded by British and Czech merchants, which is US$12 per 10,000 needles. However, our factory quotes a price of US$13 per 10,000 needles, so it is not yet possible to export.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Coal Merchants to Petition in Beijing This Morning, Requesting the Government to Improve Coal Allocation Methods</h3>
<p>[Report] More than 800 coal merchants in this city have complained that the Fuel Committee's allocation of coal is uneven and has heard rumors for several months that the source is insufficient. The allocation has been suspended for three months. At the same time, the coal merchants' self-managed coal is forcibly purchased at official prices, and the livelihood of the coal merchants is at risk. They have suggested to the guild that the government should improve these two points, which have been reported in previous newspapers. After receiving the above-mentioned suggestions, the guild has decided to elect Chairman Xie Hengcong, directors Pan Yisan, Bao Zhexiao, Mao Chunpu, Lu Qisheng, and Chen Jinrong, etc., as petition representatives, along with advisor Wang Zuxun. They convened a meeting of all the merchants in the coal industry market at 2:00 PM yesterday to exchange petition opinions. Zhao Renqin, Yu Quan, Mao Ticheng and other 30 people were added as liaison officers for the petition representatives, and they are scheduled to depart for Beijing this morning.</p>
<p>Provisional Measures for Purchasing Allocated Coal</p>
<p>The Fuel Committee previously handed over 8,000 tons of coal to the city's Social Affairs Bureau, which was then transferred to the coal business association for allocation. The allocation and purchase methods have been drafted. Merchants are required to pay within seven days, from the 18th to the 25th. Overdue payments will be regarded as a waiver. The total amount of coal allocated this time is 8,000 tons, including 5,600 tons of train lump coal, 400 tons of Kailuan No. 2 lump coal, 1,550 tons of Tongdeli Xiazi coal, and 450 tons of Great Wall briquettes. Each merchant unit can be allocated 5 tons of train lump coal or Kailuan No. 2 coal, 1.25 tons of Tongdeli Xiazi coal, and 0.375 tons of Great Wall briquettes. After paying on the above dates, they must hold a user certificate (which must be approved by the guild) to obtain the delivery voucher from the guild.</p>
<p>Adjustment of Coal Allocation Prices for Factories</p>
<p>[Report] The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has adjusted the allocation price of coal for factories (Kailuan bituminous coal fines) to 240,000 yuan per ton, starting from the 15th of this month. The original allocation price was 175,000 yuan per ton. Due to the slow arrival of this coal last month, a total of 10,000 tons were allocated. Allocation has not yet started this month, and the quantity may increase slightly compared to last month. In addition, the price adjustments for other types of coal allocated by the association are still under consideration. The briquettes allocated to public officials and teachers are still entrusted by the association to briquette factories using white coal fines. The allocation price is still 220,000 yuan per ton, or 11,000 yuan per dan. The shortfall in costs will be subsidized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain See Slight Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 9,300 shi of rice arrived from the north and south markets. Prices in the southern production areas were high, and buyers were firm. Early thin rice continued to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Northern japonica rice also increased by 2,000 yuan, and indica rice increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White yuan rose by 1,000 yuan, and yin yuan was stable. However, digestion turned sluggish at the close, and transactions were also few.</p>
<p>Flour wholesale was quite strong, rising by 300 to 1,000 yuan, while bran remained at a flat price. In the oil market, goods from Qingdao poured in, and stores lowered their expectations. Barrel peanut oil fell by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, soybean oil was flat, and there were few changes in clear oil and sesame oil. Soybean cake buyers were not active, and the situation was stable.</p>
<p>The price of soybeans in Shantou moved slightly. Oil factories inquired and digested enthusiastically, rising by 1,000 yuan. Mung beans were sluggish and lacked transactions. Adzuki beans from Nanyang entered the stomach easily, falling back by 1,000 yuan. The red sorghum market remained sluggish, corn went downstream, and transactions were dull.

<h3>The Flour Manufacturers' Association Continues to Request a Reduction in the Unified Tax on Factory Production</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued an increase in the unified tax on flour production by 700 yuan per bag, manufacturers have petitioned for exemption or a reduction, but have not yet received a reply. It is reported that Mao Xin, Fu Xin, Fu Feng, Hua Feng, and Yu Tong factories have followed the order to temporarily comply with the new unified tax, starting yesterday. The ex-factory price is 45,700 yuan per bag (previously 45,000 yuan). The Flour Bran Manufacturers' Association distributes flour to biscuit, cake, steamed bun, tea food, and liquor industries for 47,700 yuan per bag (previously 47,000 yuan). In order to continue to request a reduction in the unified tax, the above five factories and the Fourth District Flour Industry Association have filed petitions to the municipal government, which will be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. If a reduction is obtained, the factory sale price will be changed immediately. It is reported that the above factories previously sent personnel to Subei to purchase raw materials. As of now, a total of 150,000 dan have been received, which can meet the processing needs of more than half a month. According to industry insiders, it is estimated that this year's wheat harvest will be average. It is necessary to wait until after the Qingming Festival before a final determination can be made. However, excessive rainfall last winter may have affected wheat growth.</p>

<h3>The Central Bank Has Approved the Allotment of US Dollars Needed for Cotton Purchases; 40 Million Yuan for the First Quarter</h3>
<p>[Report] The Foreign Cotton Review Committee of the Import Management Committee convened a meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. As a result of the discussion, the Central Bank has approved the allotment of US$40 million for the foreign cotton quota needed for the first quarter. The Central Bank is currently discussing with the foreign cotton importers to urge them to ship the cotton that has been ordered to China first. The foreign exchange needed will be allotted by the Central Bank in installments. In addition, because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has 200,000 bales of cotton to be shipped to China, the deadline for the US$40 million foreign cotton quota for the first quarter (February to April) has been extended to June of this year. During this period, the foreign cotton needed for replenishment has been widely sought. As for the foreign cotton needed for replenishment in the second half of the year, the standing committee has also indicated that it will find ways to supply the necessary foreign exchange funds to ensure that the yarn factories do not stop production due to a shortage of raw cotton. In addition, at yesterday's meeting, someone suggested that the foreign exchange earned by yarn factories from exporting yarn and cloth should be allowed to be used by the yarn factories themselves to settle the purchase of foreign cotton. As a result of the discussion, it was still considered appropriate to hand it over for unified management.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Price Negotiation List: Textile Control Board Principally Accepts, Transfers to Price Committee for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile Control Board, in order to review cotton yarn prices, convened a temporary meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 PM in the City Hall conference room. After discussion, the board principally accepted the price negotiation list provided by the Price Negotiation Subcommittee of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, which included: (1) Purchase price of cotton yarn: standard 20-count yarn, maximum price of over 3.0 million yuan per piece; (2) Factory price negotiation for free purchase and sale by factories: standard 20-count yarn, maximum price based on cost calculated at over 3.99 million yuan per piece. The list was then handed over to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take to Nanjing for submission to the Price Committee for review.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw brisk sales of coarse plain yarn. Transactions of 10-count yarn remained minimal. Due to rumors of the Textile Control Board raising purchase prices, the market continued to be firm. As there was an extreme scarcity of 42-count two-ply yarn, the price jumped by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan due to slight absorption by weaving mills, ultimately reaching a significant transaction price of 7.35 million yuan.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn as usual yesterday, totaling 2,767 pieces, including 2,413 pieces for factories and 354 pieces for yarn dealers. There were 1,183 applications in total, including 834 from factories and 349 from yarn dealers.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sales Not Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw continued demand for high-end fine cloth from the Tianjin and Hankou groups, and market sentiment was gradually strengthening. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 157,000 yuan, rising to 162,500 yuan, a jump of 6,000 yuan compared to Saturday. "Blue Phoenix" was priced at 150,000 yuan and "Colored Ball" at 155,000 yuan, both increasing by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Other lower-end goods also increased by varying amounts of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Serge also saw demand from local customers, with the "Four Gentlemen" priced at 155,000 yuan, up 3,500 yuan. "Golden Lotus" gauze was priced at 149,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. The 20-count fine cloth from Textile Construction saw active purchase from various groups yesterday. It is said that the quality of this product can potentially replace the raw materials of Hong Kong shirt fabrics, so the price was also brisk, reaching 131,000 yuan to 133,000 yuan. Prices of other bleached cloth, raw cloth, and straight tribute cloth also increased by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while shilin cloth and blue cloth remained stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Tea Market Gradually Weakens</h3>
<p>Domestic sales of red and green tea have been narrow for a long time, with little progress. Market sentiment is weak despite wanting it to improve. As for the foreign firm tea market, the British merchants closely monitored black tea, and purchase offers were still rampant. However, they were selective on prices, and while sellers were willing to concede, they were reluctant to make excessive concessions due to cost considerations. Therefore, yesterday's transactions did not proceed smoothly, and the situation also showed signs of weakening. Sales of various green teas continued, and the situation remained lively. However, market prices were affected by the declining trend of black tea and were not as stable as last week, making it difficult to maintain a firm foothold.</p>
<h3>4,000 Tons of Soybeans for Oil Extraction: Central Trust Bureau May Allocate Within the Month</h3>
<p>In order to allocate and sell cooking oil, the oil extraction industry in this city, through Mayor Wu, obtained the approval of the authorities to allocate 4,000 tons of soybeans to subsidize the losses of various factories. Because there was no official document to the Central Trust Bureau at that time, the Central Trust Bureau refused to allocate this raw material after recent government personnel changes. After deliberation among the directors of the industry association, Zhang Decheng, director of the Central China Vegetable Oil Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was dispatched to Nanjing to meet with Jiang Menglin, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, to request regular supply of raw materials for oil extraction and allocation, and to discuss the payment of losses by the national treasury after the Central China Vegetable Oil Factory assumed the responsibility for oil allocation to civil servants and teachers. Zhang returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and said that the supply of 4,000 tons of raw materials had been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and a letter of certification had been prepared by Mayor Wu, and the allocation could be made within the month. Regarding the allocation price, the factory requested the Central Trust Bureau to allocate it at cost, approximately 55,000 yuan per dan. Currently, the total monthly oil allocation to each factory is 30,000 dan, and 4,000 tons of soybeans can only extract 8,000 dan of oil. Manufacturers hope to obtain inexpensive raw materials to revitalize the operations of each factory. Currently, the price limit for cooking oil is 250,000 yuan, and profits are meager. A document has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance requesting exemption from the 15/1000ths business tax, and the Ministry of Finance has agreed to consider it.</p>

<h3>No Donations, No Taxes, No Restrictions, No Restraints: The Carefree Nevada</h3>
<p>Reno, February 26 (Airmail from our U.S. Correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<p>In the United States, no state is more carefree and free than Nevada. New York is very bustling, but bustling does not equate to carefree. In New York City, you see people who are too busy to catch their breath all day long. California is very wealthy, but Americans in California work to live, and their emotions are not relaxed. Only Nevada is an exception. As you travel through any city or village in Nevada, you see carefree people who seem to never think about what is called work, and they certainly do not know what is called legal restraint!</p>
<p>No Donations, No Taxes, Not Even Police</p>
<p>Nevada has laws, and Nevadans have a slogan: "Live, be happy, obey the law." They never do anything that seriously violates the law. The 150,000 people in the entire state do not pick up lost items on the road, and doors are not closed at night. This is their spirit of obeying the law. However, the restrictions that the law places on their behavior are surprisingly small. Marriage is absolutely free. Divorce and remarriage, and remarriage and divorce, are commonplace. Gambling is not only public but also supported and encouraged by the state government. There are no police officers to be seen in any town in Nevada, and the state government waives any donations and taxes. Of the forty-eight states in the United States, only Nevada has no income tax, no inheritance tax, no excess profits tax, and no consumer goods tax... In a word, Nevada is "a state with no donations and no taxes." In New York City, a pack of Camel cigarettes now sells for nineteen cents at small grocery stores. But in Nevada, it only costs fifteen cents.</p>
<p>Nevada's area is equivalent to three Jiangsu provinces, and its current total population is only 150,000. The United States was originally a country with a very sparse population density, but a proportion like Nevada's is rarely seen. Nevada's "Gazetteer" says: Its population has only increased in the last fifteen years. The time around the First World War was the most desolate period.</p>
<p>Visiting a Gold Mine: A Golden Mountain</p>
<p>I have tasted this terrible "desolation," and that was on the night I stayed in the small town of Virginia City. Virginia City is about ninety miles from Reno. Early in the morning, I took a bus to visit the gold mine there. It is a mining area called "Gold Hill," one mile southeast of Virginia City. Seventy years ago, when the American "Westward Movement" was in full swing, Gold Hill was filled with thousands of outlaws who had migrated from the east. They developed Gold Hill and also prospered Virginia City.</p>
<p>The Civil War promoted the development of the American West. The great President Lincoln, while dealing with the Southern Army, devoted a lot of time to the development of the Rocky Mountain region. These newly captured areas of white people were all supporters of Lincoln during the Civil War. At that time, the Nevada hero General Reno, his name has now become a world-famous place name. The town of Sparks, near Reno, is also named after John Sparks, the governor of Nevada during the Civil War.</p>
<p>In the ten years after the end of the Civil War, the United States completed the most important step in the process of nation-building: the railroad from the Atlantic coast directly to the Pacific coast. In 1868, three years after the end of the North-South truce, railway workers developed Reno. At that time, the small town of Virginia City was already quite prosperous. General Grant, a hero of the Civil War, inspected Nevada in 1879 and was warmly welcomed in Virginia City. I still have many photos from that time. At that time, the foundation of the United States had been largely laid.</p>
<p>However, there is a time when gold is exhausted. As the gold disappeared, Virginia City became deserted. The fugitive laborers left one after another, leaving only five hundred residents sparsely dotted on this desolate mountainside. Springs now flow. Locals say that eggs can be cooked in the hot springs. I asked them: Do you still see gold dust? They shook their heads.</p>
<p>I stayed overnight in Virginia City, a town of dilapidated old houses. At dusk, the streetlights were half-bright and half-dim. As I walked on the wooden sidewalks, I could only hear my own deliberate footsteps. The loneliness of the dead city made me feel timid. It was the first time I saw an old and desolate city in America.</p>
<p>However, even in such areas, it is still carefree. In the small, narrow bars, there were several tables for gambling. Although the sparrow is small, the scale of the gambling is exactly the same as in Reno. Many gamblers looked at me with curious eyes, perhaps they had never seen a yellow person from tens of thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>The owner of the gambling hall bought me a drink. He told me many stories about gold mining here sixty years ago. He said: Now the gold mine in Virginia City is exhausted, but the silver mines near Carson City (the capital of Nevada) are still being mined. The gambling halls all over Nevada use silver dollars, and most of them are minted by Nevada's own mint.</p>
<p>He also said: When the white people invaded Nevada, they fought bloody battles with the Red Indians. The white people fought very bravely to grab the gold mines. Now, the gold is gone, but there are still many mineral products such as copper, nickel, and zinc. The University of Nevada, near Reno, is famous for its mining and metallurgy engineering.</p>
<p>Then, he sighed. This small town of Virginia City no longer has much hope. "Who is willing to come here to spend money in this barren wilderness?" He said: Nevada prohibits nothing, except public prostitutes. However, in order to prosper Virginia City, the state government specially approved the establishment of Virginia City "public brothels," and "the other name for public brothels is red lanterns"!</p>
<h3>Magnificent Ski Resorts: Genoa and Mount Rose</h3>
<p>"Freedom" is abundant in Nevada. Because of freedom, Nevadans do not feel lonely because of the desolation. On the way from Virginia City back to Reno, I also visited the "Sky Tavern" for "skiing." Skiing is a crazy hobby for Nevadans. From November in the solar calendar to May of the following year, they often use skiing to embellish their carefree days!</p>
<p>The car turned back and forth on countless mountain slopes before climbing to "Sky Tavern." There, there was excellent skiing equipment, restaurants, music, and countless cars parked. I learned to ski in Switzerland two years ago when I was on a winter tour. This time, watching the Americans play, it seemed even newer and more courageous. A young American girl said: The whole state of Nevada is a good place for skiing. There are even more magnificent slopes at the "Genoa" and Mount Rose ski resorts.</p>
<p>Genoa is in the southwest corner of Nevada, a city that started with skiing. The ski resort is one mile long and one thousand feet high. The annual Nevada and California state ski competition is scheduled to be held on February 23rd and 24th in Genoa. Mount Rose is closer to Reno, on the north shore of Lake Tahoe. There, there is a three-mile-long ski resort with a vertical drop of two thousand five hundred feet. Standing in the distance, the scene is really magnificent. Every year, the University of Nevada and Western College hold intercollegiate ski competitions here.</p>
<p>I didn't make it in time for the competition days. It is said that each competition attracts thousands of spectators from afar. The facilities at Genoa and Mount Rose were built by the same owner. His ski advertising says: Near the ski resort, there are high-end hotels, music academies, bars, and top-notch restaurants. "If guests notify us one day in advance, the restaurant can handle Chinese lunch or dinner for a thousand people"!</p>
<p>Riding, Hunting, Swimming: A Tourist Paradise</p>
<p>Highly developed material civilization has broken the desolation and loneliness. After winter is over, the seasons for spring riding and hunting, and summer swimming, are even more intoxicating. There are two lakes near Reno, Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake. Although they are saltwater, they both have a blue color. Summer on Lake Tahoe is a tourist paradise and a place where romance is created. There are elegant hotels, gardens, forests, and swimming pools. Because I was on a winter tour, I couldn't see the lively scenery. Winter at Pyramid Lake is even more desolate. There are towering, independent rocks in the lake, like Egyptian pyramids.</p>
<p>Gambling and Divorce: Unconventional Life</p>
<p>Nevadans have a famous saying: "There is no conventional life in Nevada." In China, we call it "carefree." Foreigners who come to Reno are either here for divorce or for gambling. (Note: See previous correspondence in this newspaper regarding gambling and divorce.) Gambling and divorce themselves are carefree and unconventional. Nevadans also say: "The day you leave, you have to pay taxes." The basic principle of Nevada law is "tax freedom"; many people transfer funds to Nevada to avoid taxes, which is one of the reasons. In addition, Nevada also has good weather with four distinct seasons. Sunny days account for 78 percent of the year. Therefore, newcomers may find it a little dry, but Nevadans say: Although it is dry, it is invigorating, giving a feeling of vigorous vitality!</p>
<p>The City in the Ridge: Las Vegas</p>
<p>The largest city in Nevada is Reno, followed by "Las Vegas" (second divorce). In recent years, many divorce businesses in several southern states of the United States, and even in Los Angeles and Hollywood, have been snatched by Las Vegas. The highway from Reno to Las Vegas runs through the mountains, and many people take special flights, which cost only twenty-two dollars and fifty cents.</p>
<p>I didn't go to Las Vegas, but I took a trip around several cities in western Nevada. Comparatively speaking, Reno is the most lively. Reno has two newspapers and two weekly publications, half Republican and half Democratic. The Republican Party has a deeper local base in Nevada, and that is because of the legacy of President Lincoln's era. During the Roosevelt era, the Democratic Party also developed more than before in Nevada.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Doctor: Nevada Overseas Chinese Leader</p>
<p>The University of Nevada is located in the suburbs of Reno and is known for its mining and metallurgy engineering. It is said that there are two Chinese students studying here, but I did not meet them. The number of overseas Chinese in Nevada is extremely small. An elderly overseas Chinese, Mr. Guan, practices medicine in Reno. He used to be the president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in San Francisco and is now the leader of the overseas Chinese in Nevada. He has not returned to China for more than thirty years. A long time ago, he studied at the Imperial University of Peking and read the Shanghai Shen Bao at that time. Mr. Guan took me to visit the life of the overseas Chinese. There is a gambling hall called "New Star," which is run by a group of overseas Chinese. I saw dozens of black men and women gambling there. The large gambling dens run by white people absolutely do not allow black people and Red Indians to gamble, so this business fell to the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese also have a Chinese Association. Near the association, there used to be a small "Chinatown," but later it became dilapidated due to road repairs. Mr. Guan also took me to see many museums and playgrounds, which all displayed the battles against the Red Indians. Americans will not forget how they defeated the Red Indians, perhaps just as we all know that "the Yellow Emperor defeated Chi You at Zhuolu."</p>
<p>Not Much Production: Mineral Deposits Are Almost Exhausted</p>
<p>Nevada has two major banks: "First National Bank" and "Commercial Bank." This province with 150,000 people does not produce much. Minerals and timber are two major commodities. Now, there are few mineral deposits left. There is no agricultural production on the desert-like soil. Most of the grain is transported from other provinces. However, banks in Nevada still have business to do. Nevada has plenty of investment!</p>
<p>Americans call Nevada the "Desert Empire." In fact, Nevada is not like the Gobi Desert or the Sahara Desert. Nevada is a corner of the Rocky Mountains, 4,500 feet above sea level. Except for a few man-made cities, the wilderness of Nevada is full of bare mountains, messy grass, and desolate hills. You can't see anyone for dozens of miles.</p>
<p>Federal autonomy has created a carefree and deformed society in Nevada. Nevada needs this "carefree" atmosphere to attract tourists from all directions!</p>
<h3>Good News from Guangxi Transportation</h3>
<p>— Guilin, August 8 (Airmail from our reporter Liang Xiaozhong)</p>
<p>Recently, what makes people feel happy is the smooth flow of one railway after another, and the construction of one section of weaving road after another. After the opening of the Guilin-Liuzhou section, the opening of the Liuzhou-Y宜section followed, and then the Guilin-Hengyang section was being rebuilt. The construction of Liuzhou-Zhanjiang (Zhanjiang), a bunch of good news about transportation, is like a severely injured person has completely connected the blood vessels, plus a dose of penicillin, and in a little over a year, Guangxi will be a bright sight again. Yuan Menghong, director of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway Bureau, has been repeatedly commended for his hard work. His spirit of hard work is indeed more touching than the Communist Party's labor story about Wu Manyou, and it will become a story of knocking out a railway bridge.</p>

<p>Regarding the article "Questioning the Fees for Repairing Water Pipes" submitted by reader Wang Sheng Song a few days ago: We have received a letter from the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau stating: "After transferring the matter to the French Concession Tramway and Electric Light Company for investigation, it has been reported that: 'Our company previously received a notification from the Fa Yuan (transliterated name) Exchange on Ningbo Road, stating that the water pressure in the alley was insufficient. After our company inspected the water pipes outside the water meter, we found that there was indeed a leak, which was repaired on February 18. Since this project was outside the water meter, it should be the responsibility of our company, so it was repaired free of charge and no bill was issued. Furthermore, after investigation, our personnel did not collect any fees from the residents of the alley, whether before or during the project. It seems that our company's employees all have identification cards and badges, and the so-called fees are never collected from residents by our company, but should be paid to our company's collection office. '," please publish this." We hereby publish it as requested.</p>
<p>Advertisements with Head Sores Impede City Appearance</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>It has been found that the walls of streets and alleys in the central district of the city are covered with advertisements for slippery flower and willow doctors who treat head sores, gonorrhea, leucorrhea, and other diseases. This not only hinders the appearance of the city but also deceives patients. It is hoped that the health police authorities will strictly prohibit this in order to beautify the city and prevent fraud (Jiang Huairen).</p>
<p>Dangerous Buildings Being Repaired</p>
<p>A certain reader of this newspaper pointed out the dangerous buildings at 1411-1449 and 1667-1673 Yangshupu Road. After publication, we received a letter from the secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Bureau stating that the bureau had issued dangerous notices separately, ordering the owners of the houses to repair them quickly.</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>On Currency Management and a Proposal to Issue "Price Index Treasury Bonds" (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Li Chonghuai</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Development of Trade: The government raises exchange rates. Its purpose is to stimulate increased production of exportable goods. However, in just a few days, the price of tung oil has surged past the 400,000 mark, and other export prices are also experiencing slight increases. It is doubtful how much encouragement the export industry is truly receiving as everything rises with the tide. Conversely, other production industries, especially those ordering production equipment or raw materials from abroad, are complaining bitterly. The impact on production recovery and increased production is significant, not to be underestimated. The prices of imported goods are doubling daily. With the prices of import and export commodities rising rapidly, the psychology of the people, who are always sensitive, will inevitably lead to a corresponding increase in other prices. Because the government's increased issuance of currency cannot be managed, the effectiveness of raising exchange rates will soon be negated.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding Commodity Prices, Wages, and the Supply of Daily Necessities: Before currency can be managed, strict price controls are impossible. As mentioned earlier, the people must have an outlet for the money they hold. Besides daily consumption, the people's minimum requirement is to preserve the value of their savings. Bank interest rates are too low, and production investment yields low profits with high risks. Therefore, people resort to lending at high interest rates or hoarding goods. The surface price can be fixed through political controls, but the black market cannot be eliminated, and the quality of goods under price controls will inevitably deteriorate. The government cannot force people to buy what they don't want, and when people want to buy something, restricting them will only force them to find ways to buy it. This is driven by the people's economic instincts. Therefore, even in advanced countries like England and the United States, black markets exist, let alone in our country where the people's education level and law-abiding spirit are so backward. Unified control of the supply of goods is also a factor that drives up prices. Because the government's unified procurement of goods is necessarily large-scale, any significant demand will have a significant impact on the market. The result is that the government is, in effect, replacing the people as the master of hoarding!</p>
<p>7 The Emergence of "Price Index Treasury Bonds"</p>
<p>In summary, political and rigid, multi-pronged controls are not as effective as simple economic maneuvers. These simple economic maneuvers are to find an outlet for the people's surplus purchasing power, which is the best way to manage currency.</p>
<p>Since the gold policy has lost its support (it lost support from the gold supply rather than theoretical support), and public bonds cannot be issued through normal means, it is necessary to find other instruments. These instruments should have two key characteristics: (1) They should have the characteristic of maintaining savings value, which is sufficient to guide the people's surplus purchasing power; (2) They should have sufficient exchange value, so that people can exchange them with the government at any time they need. Based on these two characteristics, I propose the issuance of a type of treasury bond based on a price index. The issuance methods of these bonds, the problem of determining the price index, the people's trust in these bonds, the issue of principal and interest repayment, the functions of these bonds, and the effects and influences they will have are discussed separately below:</p>
<p>8 Issuance Methods of "Price Index Treasury Bonds"</p>
<p>These bonds can be issued in three denominations: A, B, and C, all without face value. On the initial issuance date, these three types of treasury bonds can be listed at 100,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, and 10 million yuan, respectively. After that, the listing price will be adjusted weekly according to the price index. When the price index increases, the listing price will be calculated proportionally according to the rate of increase in the price index. If the price index in the current week is equal to the price index in the previous week, or if the rate of increase is less than 6% per annum, then the listing price for the current week will be calculated by adding 6% per annum to the listing price of the previous week, with the intention of protecting the interests of the people. During periods of rising prices, people can secure their savings. When prices are stable, people can also receive interest. At that time, the bonds will be equivalent to public bonds with an annual interest rate of 6%.</p>
<p>The buying and selling prices of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" are generally the same. However, when necessary, the government may slightly lower the selling price or slightly raise the buying price. In any case, the buying price should not be lower than the listing price calculated according to the price index. In any case, the buying and selling prices throughout the country should also be consistent.</p>
<p>The issuance and sale of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" should be fully handled by the Central Bank, entrusted by the government. The Central Bank should also entrust other national banks to handle the sales, in order to increase its power to absorb currency. The listing prices of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" bought and sold by each national bank should be the same as the Central Bank's listing price. The Central Bank may pay a handling fee of a certain percentage or deposit a certain percentage of the cash sold with the bank for business loans. However, the daily net sales and purchases of national banks must be reported to the Central Bank at the end of each business day. National banks themselves are not allowed to purchase treasury bonds, because their funds should be used for production businesses and other national policy loans. At the beginning of issuance, commercial banks and money shops should allocate 20% of their deposit amount to purchase these bonds. Thereafter, they should maintain at least 20% of their balance as treasury bonds. Those who voluntarily increase their holdings are welcome. In fact, banks and money shops will be happy to invest more in "Price Index Treasury Bonds" because they not only offer high interest rates, but also maintain the value of their assets, preventing them from depreciating with the currency. The deposit reserve of commercial banks and money shops in the Central Bank can be calculated by deducting the amount invested in treasury bonds.</p>
<p>"Price Index Treasury Bonds" can be divided into registered or unregistered types, at the purchaser's choice. These bonds can be fully cashed at any time at the local national bank at the current listing price, but cannot be used as collateral for loans from national banks, because the actual interest on treasury bonds is high, while the interest on loans from national banks is low, which may lead to arbitrage by unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>The treasury bonds issued in various regions should be stamped with the name of the issuing location. For example, those issued in Shanghai should be stamped with "Issued in Shanghai," and those issued in Hankou should be stamped with "Issued in Hankou." Treasury bonds can be cashed in different locations. However, when cashing, the remittance fee that should be paid between the original issuing location and the cashing location should be deducted, in order to prevent merchants from evading remittance restrictions.</p>
<p>The issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" can also be used to recover gold. Because using legal currency to recover gold puts too much burden on the government, especially at this time, it can exacerbate the crisis of currency inflation. Using these bonds to pay instead of legal currency will have the effect of recovering gold without the drawbacks of issuing currency.</p>
<p>9 How to Determine the Price Index on Which the Issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is Based</p>
<p>I believe that the determination of this price index should be based on the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The selection of goods and weighting methods should be based on the daily consumption of middle-class families. Otherwise, the content should be as broad as possible. The price index should not be too low, as it would not be sufficient to attract people to invest. Nor should it be too high, as it might stimulate the rise of other prices. In short, the price index should be able to represent the general price level. With a benchmark for calculating the listing price of national treasury bonds, it will not cause speculative frenzies like gold. The detailed calculation method can be agreed upon separately by statisticians, but the calculation method adopted by the government should be announced.</p>
<p>(2) The price index should be unified throughout the country. In other words, the listing prices of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" should not differ in different regions. Because if there are differences, it will inevitably lead to abnormal flows of funds and speculative arbitrage, as was the case in the past with the gold market. Because the price index should be uniform, it cannot be based on one location. Therefore, the price index should be calculated from the average of prices in many locations. The base period number is also the same. As for when to use as the base period, the relationship is very subtle. Using the prices in various locations from January to June of the 26th year as the base number is acceptable. Using the price index on the issuance date of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" as the base number is also acceptable. Because the listing price of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is determined by comparing two periods. The locations included in the calculation of the price index may be Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin (or Beiping), Shenyang (or Changchun), Qingdao, Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, Changsha, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Xikang, and other places.</p>
<p>(3) The price index should be calculated once a week. The Central Bank in various locations (or the Four Banks Joint Office can handle it. Locations without a Central Bank or a branch of the Four Banks Joint Office can be handled by other national banks) should telegraph the average price of the specified goods within a week to the Shanghai head office every Friday. The head office will collect the data and calculate the price index for the current week and the listing price of treasury bonds according to the announced calculation method. At the latest, it should telegraph the results to the Central Bank and other selling banks in various locations on Sunday. Selling banks in various locations should announce the listing price of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" on the morning of Monday and simultaneously announce the content of this price index in local newspapers.</p>
<p>The publication of the above price index is two days away from the actual price reports. This time difference may cause buyers to lose slightly when prices continue to rise, but it is very limited compared to the actual interest. Because telegrams to and from various locations take time, a difference of two days cannot be reduced further. The reason I chose Friday to Monday is that much of the time from Saturday afternoon to Sunday is non-trading time, so in fact it is only one day apart. For those who hold treasury bonds for several weeks or months, this difference is almost equal to zero.</p>
<p>10 The Problem of People's Trust in "Price Index Treasury Bonds"</p>
<p>The issuance methods and calculation standards of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" are as described above. However, the issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" does not have physical collateral and is based on the government's credit. However, the current government has repeatedly broken faith with the people. Since the people cannot trust the government, it is doubtful whether these bonds can be successfully promoted to fulfill their mission of absorbing currency.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, even if the people are skeptical about the issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds," the bonds can still be issued and will certainly achieve considerable results. I pointed out earlier that "Price Index Treasury Bonds" should have two characteristics: maintaining savings value and being able to be exchanged with the government at any time. As long as the government can absolutely maintain these two points, excellent results can be achieved, and these two points are not difficult to maintain. US dollar bonds and securities guaranteed by US dollars, and deposits backed by gold are different from this type of treasury bond. Because US dollars and gold themselves have external exchange value, and are absolutely subject to "quantity" restrictions, the government is unwilling to easily sacrifice this property, thus discounting its credit with the people. The repayment of treasury bonds is based on the government's income, but in fact it is legal currency. As far as the government is concerned, as long as the additional legal currency issued during repayment does not cause much harm to the overall economy, additional issuance is not a problem (see the discussion later in this article). As far as the people are concerned, as long as the government preserves their savings value unchanged during this period of rising prices, what more could they ask for? The so-called unchanging savings value, concretely speaking, is that if the money people spend when buying "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is enough to buy one dan of rice, half a year later (or anytime, anywhere), the legal currency they exchange from the bonds can still buy one dan of rice. This type of saving is better than hoarding real objects. Because hoarding real objects is not necessarily what you need at any time. If you buy five dan of rice this year, you may not finish eating it within a year. If you need clothing at the end of the year, exchanging rice for clothing is not so direct and convenient. Buying "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is also better than depositing money in banks and money shops. If the people do not trust the government, their level of distrust will definitely not be stronger than depositing money in money shops and lending at high interest rates. People nervously deposit money in money shops or lend it to individuals, why? Isn't it to hope to get some high interest to compensate for the savings losses during the period of rising prices? But the interest on "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is higher than depositing in any bank or money shop. The reason is very simple, because during periods of rising prices, the rate of price increase (which is also equal to the interest on "Price Index Treasury Bonds") is always higher than commercial interest. Because borrowing interest is the most important cost of commerce, merchants must make a profit higher than the cost in order to maintain themselves. If the profit from sales is not enough to pay the borrowing interest, there are three ways to follow: (1) When the supply of goods is less than demand, merchants will raise prices; (2) When the supply of goods exceeds demand, merchants will wait until interest rates are lowered before borrowing; (3) Circulation is not smooth and they are on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, in any case, the price increase will inevitably be higher than the loan interest rate of banks and money shops, and naturally even higher than the deposit interest rate of banks and money shops. The previous article pointed out that the wholesale price in January of this year was about seven times higher than the same period last year, an average increase of about 56% per month, while the loan interest rate of money shops was about 20%, and the deposit interest rate was about 12%, which is enough to prove this point. Since the interest from buying "Price Index Treasury Bonds" is higher than depositing money in banks and money shops, and is more reliable, people will definitely invest their money in this. Furthermore, banks and money shops will probably also regard "Price Index Treasury Bonds" as a major investment target, because its interest rate is higher than the loan interest rate of banks and money shops, and it is more reliable than credit loans. What is even more beneficial to banks and money shops is that they do not need to hunt for their loan customers and can enjoy the profits while sitting still, and can increase their investment in treasury bonds or convert them into cash at any time and anywhere according to the size of their own position. Most of the capital in our country is the surplus purchasing power of the people and the speculative credit of banks and money shops. Therefore, the issuance of treasury bonds will rapidly contract these surplus purchasing power and commercial speculative credit. Where there is profit, gold and stone can be opened. The sales of "Price Index Treasury Bonds" are not a problem.</p>
<p>In order to enhance social trust in the issuance of "Price Index Treasury Bonds," I would like to respectfully propose that the issuance of these bonds should be implemented after being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and the Political Council by the administrative authorities, in order to gain the support of public opinion and the people, and its effect will be obvious.</p>
<p>11 The Issue of Principal and Interest Repayment of "Price Index Treasury Bonds"</p>
<p>This will probably be the most concerning issue for the authorities and the general public, and they want to get the answer. On the surface, the problem of principal and interest repayment that we face will be more serious than any other debt. When prices are stable, the interest we pay is only 6% per annum. It is not a large sum. However, when prices rise, although no interest is added on the surface, the interest actually paid is higher than the general interest, as seen in the previous discussion. How will the government bear such interest?</p>
<p>In fact, this problem is not as serious as imagined. First of all, we should recognize the three characteristics of "Price Index Treasury Bonds": First, the interest and principal of these treasury bonds are not calculated separately. Their principal and interest are always linked together. Therefore, the calculation is not as difficult as other debts. Second, the repayment period of these treasury bonds is not specified. Their issuance is adjusted at any time according to market needs. The government can also decide when to recover them all according to the situation, without restriction. Third, the buying and selling prices at any time are in principle equal. The government sells and buys at any time and anywhere. Therefore, the debt problem that we should discuss focuses on the surplus or deficit of receipts and payments at any time.</p>
<p>The situation of the surplus or deficit of receipts and payments at any time can be roughly divided into four types:</p>
<p>(1) Only selling, no buying. This is the situation at the beginning of issuance. Only "Price Index Treasury Bonds" are released to collect currency. There is no problem of repayment, so there is no need to discuss it.</p>
<p>(2) Issuance is in progress, and the total amount of treasury bonds sold exceeds the total amount bought. This is probably a phenomenon that should occur when prices continue to rise, because people want to maintain the value of their savings. In this case, the government continues to collect currency, with only gains and no burdens, so there is no need to discuss it.</p>

<h3>Bridging Sino-French Culture: The Diderot Prize</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>In the intellectual circles of China today, I'm afraid very few people know about the "Diderot Prize," and even fewer know about its importance. Therefore, I am writing a brief introduction today, hoping that intellectuals will pay special attention.</p>
<p>Let's start with some clarification: The prize is named after "Diderot." Who is "Diderot?" Denis Diderot (1713-1784) was a French philosopher. From 1751 to 1772, for 21 years, he and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783) jointly edited and published the "Encyclopédie," a monumental work of the 18th century and a global one. Every country has an "encyclopedia," and there is more than one in France. So, why does this 18th-century French "Encyclopédie" enjoy such renown? Because of the following two main reasons.</p>
<p>First, because the authors of this encyclopedia were not only experts in various disciplines, but also masters. For example, Voltaire (1694-1778), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), Montesquieu (1689-1755), Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727-1781)... If even one of these people was willing to write, it would be dazzling, let alone when they collaborated and jointly organized this grand event?</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, this encyclopedia implicitly contains a spirit that has greatly influenced modern culture, which people call the "Encyclopédie spirit." What is this spirit? It's simple to say, but difficult to create and even more difficult to implement: (1) the pursuit of knowledge; (2) the pursuit of truth; (3) freedom of thought. These three stages are connected: in order to seek "knowledge," we seek "truth"—"knowledge" that is not "true" is not true knowledge—but if thought is not "free," there is no way to obtain "truth." The "Encyclopédie" itself fully expresses freedom of thought: because from an ideological standpoint, Voltaire and Rousseau—these two giants in the philosophical world—were enemies!</p>
<p>The goal and effort of the "Diderot Prize" is to promote this spirit of "pursuit of knowledge," "pursuit of truth," and "freedom of thought."</p>
<p>In 1936, a famous female novelist, Madame Alexandra Roube-Jansky, after obtaining sponsorship from Mr. Li Shizeng of China, established this prize. Her method was as follows: With the assistance of the French government, two journalists from China and France would be exchanged each year (recent changes, see below), with first-class travel and all expenses during their visit to the other country, lasting for six months, all covered by the government. All impressions of the visiting journalists can be written "freely," and the Prize Committee is responsible for introducing and publishing the articles. The selection of journalists is determined by the Prize Judging Committee (Jury), which is co-organized by Chinese and French people.</p>
<p>In 1936, a young French journalist won the prize and came to China, but no Chinese went out. Why? I don't know.</p>
<p>In 1937, another young French journalist won the prize and came to China, but again no Chinese went out. Why? I don't know.</p>
<p>Thereafter, due to the war, the prize was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Finally, the Prize Judging Committee was reorganized. From 1947, the organization of the committee is as follows: Chairman: Paul-Boncour (former French Prime Minister); Members: Madame Andre Viollis, a famous writer, Roland Dorgeles, Francis Carco, Pierre Marc Orlan, Georges Huysmany, General Cornigllon-Moilnier, Gerard Bauer, Pierre Descaves, Tooy-Revillon, Georges Charensol, and two representatives from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that too few Chinese journalists understand French, in the future, the Chinese side will not be limited to journalists, but will be based on writers who are proficient in French.</p>
<p>Recently, Madame Roube-Jansky came to China for the third time to plan the restoration of the "Diderot Prize."</p>
<p>If the Chinese government provides sponsorship and the intellectual circles show sympathy, a Chinese writer can be sent to France and a French journalist can be sent to China in 1947. (36, 3, 15.)</p>

<p>— Kuang Ying</p>
<p>City Gate</p>
<p>You are the strangest guest to someone who is used to living in a metropolis.</p>
<p>Every day, you stand at the edge of the city street, watching all the people coming and going; you are used to hearing those sweet words of love and sharp curses; you will not be moved at all, letting the years erode your already terrifying face. How is it that in this era when the world is dressed up so beautifully, you don't even comb your disheveled hair?</p>
<p>Poets place you in poems chanting about the border, painters arrange you in the cold scenery of the setting sun in a border town. It seems that your pitiful fate can only be accompanied by desolation and loneliness forever.</p>
<p>But there is one thing you deserve to be proud of, even in this remote small town? When those people from the countryside, carrying baskets of goods and full of joy, come to the market and pass under your ribs, they are so intimate with you. They squat in front of your knees in groups, telling each other their most concerned thoughts. At that time, you are the most proud hero in this small county.</p>
<p>Living on a piece of land with a trace of warmth in the world, you are not lonely after all.</p>
<p>Warmth</p>
<p>A series of joys escaped from my palm to the sky, and then stopped at the treetop. This, I am symbolizing the wonderful fantasy in this world with pigeon bells.</p>
<p>White wings, red beak tips, although a speck soaring in the white clouds, in the eyes of a laborer meditating by the water and a young woman leaning on the building looking into the distance, this is somewhat the most heartwarming sustenance in the world. Please take the most beautiful and moving words in the world and bring them to those distant soldiers across mountains and rivers!</p>
<p>It is above the Yellow River; it is on the bank of the Yangtze River; it is between the black waters and white mountains; it is on top of skyscrapers; it is in the trap of the cave of suffering and persecution. Everyone looks up at the white clouds in the sky and entrusts a series of hopes to the illusory loneliness. You have pierced this lonely sky with your loud singing, and also pierced the cold hearts of everyone.</p>
<p>Is it that there is too little sympathy given in the world, or is it that those cruel people have smeared pain in the world, but in this remote small town, I have never heard this light-hearted bell.</p>
<p>Village Musings</p>
<p>One spring evening, I walked slowly alone on a narrow path beside the mountain, looking at those plank houses that squatted on the ground like tired oxen in silence, and my heart was filled with a sense of emptiness.</p>
<p>The stream flows murmuringly, but there is not even a washerwoman?</p>
<p>Everything shows so quiet, I seem to be standing on a deserted island counting the shells by the water; who will recognize the series of years that have swept across this land? I feel sad; but at that time, I suddenly heard the laughter of children, as if it came from the planks of the neighbor's door. When I turned my head to look for it, I was greeted by a wave of empty thoughts.</p>
<p>On the way home, I thought like this, no matter when or where, there are people singing lyrical songs, but because laughter makes you shed tears, then, you will realize that where there is joy is also where sorrow is thickest.</p>
<p>My heart is heavy; because I have unintentionally discovered a secret of the world.</p>
<h3>The Joy of Pain</h3>
<p>— Lin Cheng</p>
<p>A painful ideal seems to lie at tomorrow's doorstep, yet feels so distant...</p>
<p>Is it the recollection of vanished past years? Or the lingering attachment to discarded love? Or perhaps the continued longing for the arduous journey through hardship?</p>
<p>Those painful emotions accumulated deep within the heart have grown faint through the experiences of life. How many tears have been shed, allowing them to melt away, to vanish beyond the river of memory.</p>
<p>I must not allow past emotions to imprison me, nor let past experiences lure me back. I should establish a foundation of faith in life from the understanding of pain, transforming every painful encounter into strength within my life. I know the road ahead will be even more difficult and the pain will surely increase.</p>
<p>Some say there is no joy without pain, but I have indeed forgotten the pain of the past. If there is still a trace lingering in my heart, it is merely the joy of liberation after a long period of imprisonment. I cannot help but feel joyful for the revival of a suffocated and paralyzed spirit resulting from pain, for the re-ignition of this proud and resilient life intent!</p>
<p>To extract one's emotions from the abyss of pain is like a seed sprouting from frozen soil. From then on, life begins to have new hope and encouragement, but from then on, life will also suffer more devastation and trials. Therefore, I must more clearly open my eyes to survey this vast world, arranging my life in reality to embrace more pain!</p>
<p>Like trampled weeds, growing and spreading tirelessly, yet without excessive dreams that would deplete the wellspring of life, because from reality to the future, there should be a painful journey, and tomorrow's footsteps will never reach the far-off joy!</p>
<h3>The American Modern Theatre Scene—A Report on Wan Jiabao's Lecture</h3>
<p>— Le Meicen</p>
<p>When Principal Xiong announced that Mr. Wan Jiabao would attend our first literary evening and agreed to lecture on "The American Modern Theatre Scene," a stir of excitement rippled through the audience, and everyone eagerly awaited the arrival of 7:00 PM on the evening of March 9th.</p>
<p>After the audience for "Liang Shang Jun Zi" (a play title) gradually dispersed, everyone began to decorate the venue for the literary evening. The comrades in charge of the lighting made the entire venue as bright as snow with spotlights and cast a halo on the stage.</p>
<p>Many drama-loving students from the law school and Guanghua University, hearing the news, rushed to participate, becoming uninvited guests.</p>
<p>Mr. Wan Jiabao arrived amidst thunderous applause. His refined and frail appearance reminded people of a delicate Chinese scholar. He was dressed in a long gray cotton robe, with the sleeves of his cotton-padded jacket extending an inch longer than the robe. His soft hair was parted naturally on the left side, and he wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses that flashed with sharp and insightful eyes, making people feel the depth of his penetration. A purple-red scarf around his neck gave you an impression of unpretentious and unrestrained elegance.</p>
<p>He taught with passion, often forgetting the end of class. He said he lacked concentration himself, but in fact, perhaps because his thinking was too focused, he never paid attention to the end-of-class bell. When he taught, he usually did not look at the audience, as if deliberately avoiding your gaze, sometimes stroking his temples, revealing a shy expression.</p>
<p>When Mr. Xiong mentioned that he wanted the students who were not taking Mr. Wan's class to admire Mr. Wan's demeanor, it elicited loud laughter. Mr. Xiong said that even he himself, among the current Chinese playwrights, none could match Mr. Wan's achievements, and praised his serious creative attitude: his works, once published, were sure to be astonishing.</p>
<p>Mr. Wan nodded to the applauding audience, indicating his acknowledgement. He began by saying: "I dare not accept Mr. Xiong's praise." Then he said: "It's true that I write slowly, but I'm deeply ashamed that I haven't achieved 'seriousness' yet." Moreover, he modestly admitted that he lacked concentration.</p>
<p>Returning to the main topic, he discussed the American theater scene, with the following key points: (1) He said that the claim that American drama is completely commercialized is not entirely fair based on his actual observations. There are many progressive writers in the United States, and progressive plays also have the opportunity to be staged. Generally, the performances are above par, and the wealthy bosses who invest money do not pay much attention to the content of the plays. (2) There are not many places where American drama can really make money. The main one relies on the "Public Theatre," which has one million members, somewhat like the ticket offices of Chinese Peking Opera. It provides directors, theaters, and actors, not only cultivating the public's interest in watching plays, but also training many new talents, becoming an important pillar of the American theatre scene. (3) There are two types of American professional playwrights: one is passively not acknowledging Hollywood drama, and they believe that they are currently working in Hollywood just to "strike gold." Once their pockets are full, they will write "what they want to write"; the other is an active public educator, they expose mercilessly and enlighten correctly, represented by Wilder. (4) He believes that even though some American writers have incorrect ideologies, their skill in catering to preferences and the thoroughness of their observations are beyond the reach of Chinese playwrights. (5) The United States is currently promoting a "repertory theater" system to correct the flaw of a play being performed for several years—it prevents newcomers from advancing and makes professional plays a commodity. After this theater system is established, it can select some good plays to perform. Last year, these theaters staged plays by Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, Ibsen, and Barrie.</p>
<p>He ended his speech, and the students responded with warm applause. The entertainment program began, and everyone heard the bedtime bell ringing loudly only when coffee was served. After the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, they were still pondering Mr. Wan's lecture.</p>

<h3>On Poetry</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>If the artistic conception is vague and the archetype is illusory, then the soul and essence of poetry are invisibly lost. Great poems in the world originate from a simple and pure central idea, forming the most powerful story, while being precisely and concretely expressed. And a poem's manifestation should be like a giant standing tall and the vastness of a sea, allowing people to grasp, appreciate, even the shortest poem of one or two lines should possess a complete individual entity.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 198</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"What a pity..." At this moment, I touched upon another thought; perhaps it was that the secret of "eight" had not yet been satisfactorily answered, and I really wanted to find out the truth from Pingzi's mouth. With this thought, I blurted out the words "What a pity," meaning "It's a pity that I can't ask Pingzi in person; as long as she is willing to be frank and open."</p>
<p>"What?" Mr. W asked me, meaning "What a pity?"</p>
<p>I told Mr. W the idea I had. In my tone, I implied that Tsurumi and Pingzi might be discussing this issue, but unfortunately, I couldn't hear it.</p>
<p>"What a pity!" Mr. W also let out a sigh; "Tsurumi is our friend, he is working and struggling in a position that is ten times more difficult than ours. Respect is unnecessary to say; we should do our best to provide him with convenience, convenience in his work, and we should absolutely not stimulate his emotions; we should encourage him both in person and behind his back, and we should not give him even a trace of blow, whether in words or actions. Otherwise..."</p>
<p>Mr. W paused here. I understood the first part of his words very well, but although I understood the latter two sentences, I did not understand the meaning of his intention. Why did he say these two sentences? Why was there this final turn, "Otherwise..."?</p>
<p>"Otherwise..." I wanted to ask Mr. W to continue. But at the same time, I suddenly had an inspiration and understood Mr. W's intention—"Otherwise, just flip a switch, and we can hear what they are saying"—and nodded knowingly, "I understand... But it doesn't matter. I can do this, I just don't know if it's convenient to use this device now." This "device" refers to the "listening device." By turning on the electric hammer of this device, we can hear the conversation between Tsurumi and Pingzi.</p>
<p>"If it's convenient, there's no problem... But..." Mr. W frowned, as if he had some unspeakable pain, and there was also some unwillingness in his determination.</p>
<p>I knew that Mr. W didn't want to eavesdrop on the conversation between Tsurumi and Pingzi because he was afraid of hurting Tsurumi's feelings, fearing that he would be hurt after he learned about it. But I didn't care. Tsurumi and I, we know everything and say everything endlessly. He will tell me about his conversation with Pingzi anyway. Even if he is unwilling to explain it automatically, I can ask him until the seas run dry and the rivers run dry. Mr. W and Tsurumi are separated by a layer after all. So I decided to do it myself.</p>
<p>Because of my stay in Mr. W's house these past few days, I have become familiar with most of the equipment. Only this "listening" item, because I have never seen them use it, I still can't find where the sound transmitter is, how to turn it on, and I don't know where the electric hammer is.</p>
<p>On a personal level, although I can afford to listen to the conversation between Tsurumi and Pingzi, after deciding on this thought and before actually implementing it, in this moment of distance, a inexplicable "?" symbol also appeared in my conscience.</p>
<p>The work of spies and detectives is generally most unwelcome, and even hated, by a certain section of society: they hate them for liking to pry into other people's secrets or "secrets." According to a certain "moral" of the gentleman's sect, this kind of behavior seems to lack some glory. At this moment, I suddenly had an inexplicable question, probably because this traditional concept of "gentleman" was at work. But thinking back, "Why do I want to take on this kind of work? Isn't it for the sake of the country and for the sake of saving humanity from tragedy that I am willing to risk my life to do this work? With such a stance, my mind should be very frank; with this frank mind, why bother sacrificing this hypocritical 'gentleman's concept'?"</p>

<h3>Regarding the Recent Situation of "The Commercial Press"—And a Report of Good News</h3>
<p>— Hei Xing</p>
<p>The magazines of "The Commercial Press" were indeed "popular" before the war. Whether it was the selection of materials or the content, they were indeed up to par, and the only one that has survived and is still published is "The Eastern Miscellany." In order to know their future publishing plans, I made a special trip to their head office on Henan Road, and in the promotion department and publishing department, I obtained the following pieces of news that are worth making people happy.</p>
<p>They are actively restoring the lineup of all past magazines. For example, "Children's Magazine," their "New Children's World" has decided to be re-published on Children's Day, April 4th, and the chief editor is Mr. Shen Baiying.</p>
<p>And "The Short Story Magazine," which used to be famous in the literary world, has now decided to be renamed "Literary Magazine," edited by Mr. Zhu Guangqian, and the first issue of the re-publication will be published in May.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a "Xueyuan Monthly," which is published by the Xueyuan Society and can also be published in mid-May, and "Education Magazine" is also actively restoring its publication.</p>
<p>This should be a great piece of good news for the Shanghai publishing world, which has suffered so much! We hope that "The Commercial Press" can make full use of their existing resources and financial resources to publish several books of academic value for the Chinese publishing world; because whether it is science, literature, or education, the current situation is so barren and so desolate!</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the promotion department, their "New Middle School Library" is prepared to be published in three, four, and five months. The first issue in March has been published, and they plan to publish on schedule in the future. Before all the books are published, they do not intend to sell them piecemeal. The entire book has a total of 463 volumes, and the pre-order price is 2,336,180 yuan.</p>
<p>I once asked about the recent situation of their Zhabei printing factory and the Oriental Library. It is said that the Oriental Library has now been razed to the ground, and there is no trace of such a magnificent building ever existing there in the past. As for the printing factory, it still retains a part, and they are negotiating for the agency occupying it to relocate.</p>
<p>The Reconstruction Committee of the Oriental Library has been working continuously, and they hope that one day, they will be able to rebuild this palace of learning on the original base that was destroyed by the war!</p>
<p>They have also submitted a request to the government, asking Japan to compensate for this almost irreparable loss, but until now, it seems that they have not been able to get a definite answer. (End)</p>
<h3>Wartime Tragedy of Incest—Reading Feng Zikai's Adventures on the Shu Road</h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Zikai's "Adventures on the Shu Road" in the second issue of the fourth volume of Wenyi Chunqiu painfully describes that the result of the evil war, in addition to the destruction of families, also has a side effect that makes people laugh and cry.</p>
<p>The fact is this: a middle-aged woman married a man surnamed Fan in her hometown and gave birth to a daughter named Lingjie. The evil war caused their family of three to flee from Jiaxing to Hengyang. In the air raid in Hengyang, her husband, Fan, was bombed to death, so she worked as a servant in Li Xia's house, and Fan Lingjie worked as a maid in the home of a certain regiment commander. In the great fire in Hengyang, Li Xia and his wife first went to Sichuan one after another, and Mrs. Fan followed. It was unknown that several months later, Mrs. Li died of illness. Following Mrs. Li's will, Mrs. Fan became Li Xia's stepmother. Furthermore, Lingjie followed the army to Jiangxi after the army was dispatched in Hengyang. Later, the regiment commander died in battle, and his wife took Fan Lingjie back to her hometown of Nanjing, which had fallen into enemy hands. She changed her occupation to work in a yarn factory. One day, she suddenly encountered two beast soldiers who intended to defile her. At this time, Li Xia's father (Old Li) was working as a Japanese translator and happened to encounter this incident. With the courage of a heroic and righteous person, he called her his daughter to resolve this tragic situation. It was unknown that after Fan Lingjie encountered this danger, she lamented her loneliness and deeply felt Old Li's heroism and righteousness, often giving Old Li gifts to express her gratitude. Later, she learned that Old Li was widowed and had the idea of entrusting herself to him for life. Soon after, she became Li Xia's stepmother. Later, Old Li responded to his son's call to Sichuan, and after meeting, it turned into a family relationship of father, son, mother, daughter, husband, and wife that made people laugh and cry!</p>
<p>"First, let's talk about Mrs. Fan: her husband is also her grandson, her father-in-law is also her son-in-law; her daughter is also her step-mother; now let's talk about Lingjie: her husband is also her grandfather; her former son is also her stepfather; her mother is also her daughter-in-law. Now, let's talk about Old Li: his son is also his father-in-law; his wife is also his granddaughter; his mother-in-law is also his daughter-in-law. Finally, let's talk about Li Xia: his wife is also his grandmother; his stepmother is also his daughter; his father is also his son-in-law."</p>
<p>What a tragic tragedy of incest!</p>
<h3>"Miraculous Skill"</h3>
<p>— Lu Chou</p>
<p>I remember that before the war, when the Bai Jin Long cigarettes of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company in my country were in their prime, foreign capitalist Wang Yizhe actually used doubled capital of 60 million to fight the national cigarette company head-on; not only did the "She's Still the Best" Hadrin beauty drawing appear everywhere in the advertisements, but also they spared no expense to give away Hadrin unconditionally; and they also bought a large number of Bai Jin Long cigarettes and secretly transported them to the market after they became moldy. As a result, Hadrin became the leader after Bai Jin Long. The national cigarette company stepped down in an instant.</p>
<p>Another example is Japan, this stubborn, patriotic nation with creative imitation, but in the business of typewriters, it has also been drained of an unknown amount of money by the Americans. The facts are even more thought-provoking. At first, the Japanese would rather die than buy things from other countries with their own money, but finally, under the good impression of the Americans' unconditional bonus to the Japanese record-breaking typists and the advertisement propaganda of the public competition of Japanese transcription typists without using typewriters, the purchasers of typewriters in Tokyo were shocked.</p>
<p>With the daily development of the news business, advertising techniques have also become increasingly ingenious, mysterious, and unpredictable. Especially in the United States, the most materialized capitalist country.</p>
<p>These capitalists once fought advertising lawsuits over the curvature and straightness of toothbrushes, and over whether the position of the car pedal was inside or outside. They didn't even care about advocating the functions of sleeping pills, and said that their wives originally refused to sleep with anyone, but now they don't refuse any strangers. As long as you have visited an advertising company, as long as you have accepted the love of a beautiful hostess, you can finally understand how "advertising" occupies the most important seat on the mat for the capitalists to help.</p>
<p>Advertising cooperates with philistine conspiracies, and advertising forms the lackeys and accomplices of capitalist society. The more capitalism reaches its peak, the more "amazing" and "astonishing" advertising techniques become.</p>
<p>Scientific Essay</p>
<h3>The Life of Fish</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>Moths, frogs, crabs, and snakes all love light. When they see light, they want to approach it. Moths are especially fierce, rushing towards the light, even burning their wings. If they can fly up, they still rush towards the fire. Frogs and crabs, when they see the light, first stand still, and then the frogs jump lightly, and the crabs crawl slowly. As for snakes, if you see the light, they will swim quickly, following the light.</p>
<p>Mandarin fish and other fish in the water also love light. In late spring and early summer, frogs croak loudly in the middle of the night, and we can carry a lamp along the water surface to catch them. When the frogs see the light, they don't jump or escape. The fish float and swim close to the water surface, and they don't escape either. Mandarin fish move in a twisting manner with the movement of the light.</p>
<p>Zoologists tell us that "fish don't have very good eyesight. In the water, they can only see a distance of two or three feet. Once they are out of the water, they are completely blind and can't see anything. At the same time, some deep-sea fish are completely blind even in the water because the environment is dark, and their eyesight gradually declines and gradually disappears."</p>
<p>Since fish don't have very strong eyesight, how do they guard against dangers within a considerable distance that their eyesight can't reach? The waves in the water cause them to be alert and run at high speed. When we are fishing, we often use long bamboo poles to knock on the water to cause large waves, and the fish start to run, so they rush into the net themselves. If you knock on the west side, they will escape to the east, and vice versa, if you knock on the east side, they will escape to the west. Sometimes, the fish have already run into the net. If you pull up the net too quickly, so that the water in the net you turn over becomes more turbulent, the fish will jump back out. Fishermen call this action of the fish "returning the net."</p>
<p>Fish always swim upstream in rapid currents. If they are weak and are spun around by the rapid currents and flow downstream, they will struggle hard after a while, turn around, and swim upstream. Why is this?</p>
<p>Because fish use their gill filaments to breathe, and when they breathe, they always open and close. Water enters from the mouth and flows out when the gill cover opens. If they swim with the current, the gill cover will be held together by the water, making it difficult to breathe. If they swim upstream, water enters from the mouth and then exits from the gills, and the above-mentioned difficulties will be completely avoided and there will be no suffering.</p>
<h3>Walking in the Void—The Burning of the Hardoon Family Temple</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>The Hardoon Temple Sacrifice is wonderfully unique, alas, the Aili Garden still exists, the wealthy old man did not take a penny with him when he died, and the inheritance is fiercely contested!</p>
<p>Who knows that the fire god Bodhisattva would deceive the Jewish merchant? It is pitiful to live and die as a wandering soul, and the temple is almost reduced to ashes!</p>
<p>Fish mostly like to live in groups. In the summer mornings, we often see groups of fish going out to swim. The large ones are in the back, the small ones are in the front, the large ones are on the surface, and the small ones are at the bottom. Even when they are frightened and escape, they still maintain this order and will not be chaotic.</p>
<p>Fish secrete slippery slime all over their bodies in order to reduce water resistance and also to escape easily from enemies. Eels and fins are especially smooth.</p>
<p>Fish mostly become spindle-shaped. When the sea rages, the head rushes forward, making it easy to break the water and reduce water resistance.</p>
<p>During the mating season, the males of fish near the coast chase the females, forming group swims that even stretch for several miles. This opportunity gives fishermen great convenience. Spreading their nets to catch fish, they will surely return with a full load.</p>
<h3>Art and Literature Circles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai art community held its first tea party at 3:00 pm on March 16. More than 100 people attended, including Chu Wen, Zheng Wuchang, Zhang Yuguang, and Wu Qingxia. There were also various entertainments. The next preparatory people were determined to be Wang Yaguang, Xu Weinan, and others.</p>
<p>The "Literary Exchanges" column of the Tianjin Dagongbao had an article at the end of last month that reviewed "Wenyi Chunqiu," praising its rich content, exquisite printing, and lively arrangement, calling it the only spiritual food for literary youths in the Pingjin area.</p>
<p>The novelist SY is still teaching at Sichuan University in Chengdu. His recent work "Water Margin Biography" has been staged and has been well received. However, the author is dissatisfied with the original work and is rewriting it.</p>
<h3>Many Fires in Recent Days</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou</p>
<p>Since the great fire on Wuding Road, the fire god seems to have fallen in love with Shanghai, and he is always reluctant to leave. If we use the writing style of a certain predecessor, then we are talking about "fire" changing our complexion, but the fire god is pressing us as his own, and he is deliberately having a "fiery" relationship with us.</p>
<p>Just as theorists find the cause and effect of all phenomena, we naturally have something to say about the many fires. The first is that the weather is too dry; the second is that there are too many flammable raw materials in the construction of houses, such as shantytowns; the third is that there are also big fires burning abroad, and we seem to have an excuse. Recently, someone discovered a fourth reason: hoarders hoarding large things.</p>
<p>For example, as reported in various newspapers, in the early morning of the 15th, a fire broke out on the fourth floor of the British-owned Yuanfang Foreign Firm warehouse on Sichuan Middle Road. The fourth floor was rented by Tongfeng Edible Oil and Grocery Store, so "once it caught fire, it could not be contained." As a result, in addition to all the edible oil and hemp and other items piled up in the store being burned, the medicinal materials piled up in another store were also burned to ashes. At this time, the fire god was still not satisfied and spread to the tobacco leaves piled up in a certain cigarette factory on the third floor.</p>
<p>Edible oil, hemp, medicinal materials, and tobacco leaves are all flammable things, and the arrival of the fire is really "well-founded." What is difficult to understand is that there was also a diesel oil storage on the second floor, but it "fortunately was not affected." If flammable things have the potential to cause a fire, then unless diesel oil suddenly turns into water, there is no reason to be spared.</p>
<p>Where should these flammable things be placed? Is it difficult to soak them all in water?</p>
<p>The title "Many Fires in Recent Days" was added to the front of the fire news quoted above by a certain newspaper. However, the weather in recent days has not been too dry. The places that burned are not shantytowns. And there has been no news of big fires burning abroad in the past few days. I think theorists will definitely appear in the near future, and they will come up with newer reasons.</p>
<h3>Siege City Season</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>She nodded, but didn't immediately stand up and leave. After Xu Shaoming had entered the dining room, about a quarter of an hour passed before she walked in, accompanied by a burst of children's innocent laughter, this young mother whose heart had been greatly shaken. She held the two lively children, one on each side, with her hands. The one on the left was taller and a girl; the one on the right was about four or five years old and a boy.</p>
<p>This dining room in the Xu household, which had seemed disorganized and desolate due to the impact of the evacuation, immediately gained a sense of life with the entry of these two children.</p>
<p>Old Zhu also resumed his jocular and smiling demeanor, busying himself with arranging seats for the children, trying to make them laugh, and asking them their names.</p>
<p>"The older one is called Jifei, and the younger one is called Rong'er," Guan told him.</p>
<p>The meal was very enjoyable. Xu Shaoming was originally very particular about food, and the table was piled high with dishes, all of which were exquisite. He enthusiastically urged his guests to drink and eat, and Old Zhu accompanied him in drinking four cups of Moutai. Fei Fei and Rong'er ate a lot of food, but the young woman's response remained calm and somewhat wary, making Xu Shaoming feel apprehensive. Later, he stopped greeting her and just drank and joked with Old Zhu.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was four or five parts drunk, Old Zhu suddenly pretended to be very serious and said to him:</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, Lao Xu, Miss Jin has run off with Little Shen! They are now living in our theater troupe and want to leave with us."</p>
<p>The magic of these words was truly potent. Xu Fatty immediately put down his wine glass, his face full of smiles, revealing an eager and excited expression.</p>
<p>"Really?" He was still somewhat skeptical. "Little Shen treated Jin Aili too harshly; I expected that they would eventually fall out. Aili is an old friend of ours too. I've been flattering her since I was in Hong Kong two years ago. That woman has such a good temper, it's pitiful." He turned his body slightly and smiled slyly at Old Zhu. "If she wants to leave, why squeeze in with you? Tell her to come find me!"</p>
<p>The young woman only busied herself with her two children, not caring much about what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Old Zhu suppressed a laugh and shook his head.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid she wouldn't want to! If your wife screamed at the top of her voice, she would scare herself so badly that she'd be half-blind, where would Miss Jin get that kind of temper!" (17)</p>
