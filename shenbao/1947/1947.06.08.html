<h3>緊縮通貨放鬆管制經濟新方案審議中　徵收財產稅亦縝密硏究</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕張院長最近於書面答覆參政員為問時，曾謂：「整個經濟改革問題，本院已擬有方案，正呈請國民政府審議中。」頃據某權威人士談：經濟改革方案雖已擬就，然若干細節猶待研討。在方案見諸實施前，當前經濟金融政策將仍不外循下列兩原則進行：（一）緊縮通貨，包括减少發行額，收縮放款數量等。（二）放鬆管制，使生產及其他一切事業所受管制咸能逐步减少。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕當局對經濟緊急措施方案，正澈底加以檢討，而對於平衡預算部門，尤為重視。就支出部門而論，方案中所規定之减少一切不必要支出一點，在實行方面，頗多値得斟酌之處，例如國家所化於征糧機構之經費，約計七千六百億，而所得為數殊少，所費較在市面購買並不便宜多少。因之，有一部份人主張，將三成　還地方，並由地方自征，如是，至少可省數千億。事務方纖，若千地万稅務機關開支，較稅收額為多。為减少財務行政費計，有人主張恢復往昔之包說制度。再就軍費而論，軍隊員額似嫌過多，若干專家建議，將後方軍人數額减少，並儘量令軍人担任實際工作。至就增加收入而論，將開征一次財產稅。此外，政府或將提取一種「變相的肪補政策」，以換取外匯。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕全國經委會所屬五小組，本週內咸曾開會，對平衡預算事，曾詳加檢討，現已完畢，正整理報告書，俾向九日經委會提出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕征收一次財產稅事，當局正縝密研究中，其開征使為時間問題。聞全國經委會開會時，一部份委員主張，國家經濟已瀕臨如此危急關頭，對豪門資本不容再事放任，為使全國國民一新耳目計，至少亦應作一種「象徵的課征」。有人建議光開列一百個豪門名單，課征百分之五十之一次財產稅，以為天下創。</p>
<h3>高爾德自美返滬談目前中國局勢　中共拖延政策圖使經濟更惡化</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市大美晚報總主筆高爾德，前日自美返滬，對記者提出之各項問題，分別詳予答覆。高氏認為：美國之對華政策，雖經馬歇爾調停之失敗，在本質上並無變化。但經此挫折，使美人認識處理中國問題之困難，故在態度上，以往偏於情感，今則注重現實。至於目標則始終不變，且將更努力以完成之。美國之對華借款為商業借款，而非政治借款，貸出時須考慮能否收　，故本人拍發之專電中，認為唯有中國內部實現和平，借款始有成功之希望。惟此乃一般之推理，並不特定指某種借款而言。以中國情勢而言，共黨日前正在實施拖延政策，希望國內經濟情形更趨惡化，因而增强中共之地位。但此種政策之結果，受損害者為中國整個國家。記者告以有人認為美·蘇關係如有改善，則國共問題將易於解決，高氏答謂：「各人有各人之看法，個人則認為美國無意支持國民黨，以取得在華之控制勢力，蘇聯亦不致公開支持中共」。關於杜魯門主義，高氏認為此為美國一般人之認織與主張，將此種政策與杜總統之名相聯擊，實屬不妥，因個人之政治命運，起伏不定，在兩次大戰中，美國均遠反本身之願望，拋入漩渦，故目前一般認為美國應多過問世界之事務，亦應多予需要者以協助，今日世界日益紋小，故美人之國際思想亦日益抬頭。至於此項政策是否將刺激蘇聯，視胥蘇聯之思想而定，如不從事於第三國際活動及推行共產主義於世界，則對美國之政策當無不滿之理由。記者告以我國之人民及政策，對日本之復興，深表重視，認為將有一日威脅中國及世界。高氐認為不必如此重謀，因日本現狀之窘，出於世人想像之外，決非短期內所能恢復，美國對日本之管制，亦將長期　格實行。惟日本人民鑒於現狀之壤，正努力工作，以求改善環境，本人認為日本之復興，足使中國警惕，但在相當時間內，不致構成威脅。</p>
<h3>曼徹斯特衛報評述中共劣蹟</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫教六日電〕曼徹斯特衛報，刊載其駐華記者論文稱：吾人不應因對國民黨之素表不滿，而無視共黨政體之劣蹟。關於共黨之劣蹟，該記者稱：關於共區內共黨暴行之報告至多，且來源不同，故其中必有眞實之依據，每値共黨脅迫任何地區時，該區人民即紛紛避人政府控制地區，而從未聞有政府控制地區人民趨入共產控制區者。該文中並論及英國對華貿易可能性問題稱：目前英國對華貿易之機會甚微，但某上海知名之商界人士曾稱：英國在華公司，目前須能堅特其信心，則時機將有轉變，英商之機會仍將來臨。該文末稱：中國刻對英國抱有眞實之友誼，僉認英國對華無任何野心，而英國予印度獨立之聲明，予中國以深刻之印象，且使英國不復被議為帝國主義國家。</p>
<h3>美使館參事等由瀋飛平轉京</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽七日電〕美駐華大使館公使銜參事巴特華暨美國務院遠東司副司長潘斐德等一行，七日晨飛平轉京，美前駐潘領事齊愛斯同時離潘。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽七日電〕瀋陽近日流言多，但安謐，充裕人士續逃平·津，遼南，安東，遼北難民，學　，則來潘陽，坐於各該省府辦事處門前，等候救濟。</p>
<h3>主席在勵志社宴軍官團學員</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕蔣主席七日下午七時在厲志社召宴軍官訓練國研究班全體壓員，並邀白祟禧作階，席間對各學員訓勉有加。又白崇禧七日午十二時半宴太原綏署參長郭宗汾，台灣參政員陳逸松，楊忠等，下午四時半接見晋　參政員武誓彭，李培德，張一善，劉杰等。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽七日電〕旅大視察團一行，已由旅赴大連視察，並與蘇方舉行座談會。</p>
<h3>張君勱即晉京</h3>
<p>伍憲子不擬就任府委</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據徐傳霖表示，為工作上之便利，就任府委後，擬長期留京。民社黨對憲法之統一解釋，頗為重視，張君勱為此將於日內晋京。徐氏並謂，組織委員洪少植已得美洲方面民主憲政黨來電，謂對黨內之糾紛，決保持中立態度。伍憲子昨日對徐氏表示，不擬就府委之職，不久即將返港。</p>
<h3>左舜生抵滬訪晤霍寳樹</h3>
<p>商農業器械運用問題</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕農林部部長左舜生氏，於昨晨七時由京搭車蒞滬，十時許赴晨林部農業復員姿員會上海通訊處，對該會近來工作推動情形，有所　詢，旋赴行總會晤霍署長寳樹，就農業及器械運用問題有所商討。午後，左氏偕該部馬司長保之赴復　島，視察行總與農林部剏辦之農墾機械裝修公司及聯總之漁具器材，四時許陳氏參加美大使館農業參贊道生氏（Dowson）之茶會。又悉，左氏將於今夜返京。</p>

<h3>濟靑濰外圍平靜　魯共軍主力退集第地二綫　豫北緊張戰事一觸即發</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南七日電〕濟，靑，維外園週來倶平靜，濟南方面僅東南之西　駐共軍獨立團，文祖纖駐第一軍分區千人，吐絲口，茶葉口問駐魯中軍區二千人，黃河北岸濤張方面，日昨開到由豫北竄回之劉伯誠殘部萬餘人，正休息整補，至沂蒙山區沂莒前綫，週來亦僅小戰鬥。</p>
<p>〔本的濟南七日電〕魯共軍主力，據報已暫脫離虞塲，退集第二綫積極整補，待機蠢動，至再度大戰究在何時何地展開，目下尙無顯著跡象可尋。現魯共軍十個縱隊分布情形為：第一縱隊駐東里店，第七縱隊駐大張莊（皆在博山沂水間），二，六兩縱隊駐博山，三，四兩縱隊駐臨水，益都及馬站，蔣峪，五縱隊駐諸城至膠濟路以北，現使第八縱隊駐極台，十縱隊駐章邱，齊東，九縱隊駐掖縣東南之大澤山，魯共採取此項部署，其主要原因，乃因沂蒙山區臨近戰塲部份經上月中旬大戰所有水井全部被熱塞，加以糧食缺乏，為便於補給計及接收兵員搶割各地新委屯作軍糧，故有此項新布置。外傳共軍主力已有一部渡河，企圖攻擊平，津，絕對不確，實際上截至七日止，僅有少數部隊渡河至惠民，利津，接收新兵，現惠民社駐有醬共敎導旅特一二團，利津駐有新兵師。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南七日電〕潛伏長淸，肥城，平陰三角地區零星共軍，經虱軍週來積極掃蕩後，至六日已全被肅淸，殘共冀魯豫軍區崔子明部，張耀南部各兩千，已向肥城，東平間流竄，國軍正繼續追擊中。</p>
<p>〔本報新浦七日電〕灌雲縣屬重鎭響水口，昨夜一時被共軍攻陷，市內人民遭共軍屠殺甚衆，海州國軍馳援反攻，戰事頗為激烈。</p>
<p>〔中央社鄭州七日電〕豫北前北上國軍，與共軍劉伯誠主力，近均在廣大地區運動，戰事一觸即發。刻劉伯誠主力一部確已渡過衛河，但一部尙在湯陰東南五陵集，屯子集一帶，淇縣現已成為軍事眞空地區，因該處在目前雙方戰略上，已不甚重視。安陽國軍已將東南十五里南北廿里內之村莊完全收復，外國共軍處處暴　空隙，安塲之　，事實上業已消失。</p>

<h3>對參政會和平呼籲　中共非正式答覆　否定該會資格拒絕和談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕與中共重開和平談判之方案，雖經參政會提出，但其實現殆屬極端困難，據此間收聽共黨新華社電台五日晚廣播，彼等對參會提出之和平呼籲，已提出非正式之答覆。中共方面對參政會之資格，竟予以否定，據稱：參政會乃國民當御用之參政會，該會旣提議停止徵糧，微兵，發出和平呼籲，同時復對有利於作戰者，作種種決議，實失和平之眞義。記者七日就此項問題詢諸政府人士，據稱：中共此項表示，乃又一次之拒絕和談，關閉和平之門，和平前途殊多暗礁，政府片面提出和平，實無法獲得結果也。</p>
<h3>美茶業專家赫琴森　論華茶改進計劃　須多做廣吿與印茶競爭</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約七日電〕美國茶業專家赫琴森，單獨接見中央社記者，評論中國政府改進茶葉工業三年計劃請：該計劃固佳，惟實施時恐多困難，因戰後迄今，中國茶業品質不佳，且印度錫蘭茶業多作廣大宣傳，而中國對此則付闕如，結果，美國一般人士熟知印度錫蘭茶勝於華茶。據赫琴森謂。華茶因品質不佳，　買者劇减。記者間該三年計劃是否足使華茶爭回美國市塲？赫氏認為　能多作廣告，　或可增加在美國之銷路，惟因美國人多已嗜印度錫蘭茶，華僑最多　可追隨而不能成為一主要　美之國家。赫氏承認按照該計劃，中國　易發展成為好茶出口國。同時，赫氏　示：因品質不佳，而被退回之　茶，數量不列數　，本年一月至五月華茶輸美之　磅數計十萬零六百七十　之平水茶，中有四萬五千磅被退，十一萬九千一百五十七磅務茶中，有五萬三千九百九十磅被退，八萬零四百八十磅廣州鳥隨荷亦有一千六百九十　　磅退，另一方面一千二百十五磅之龍并茶，一萬二千四百十八磅之香　茶，五萬三千四百卅磅之祁門茶，九百廿八磅荔校茶（譯昔），二萬七千零十六磅羅山茶（譯音），悉被收購而無退同者。赫氏謂：中國茶葉出口商在裝箱上，頗多困難。渠認為其原因由於中國缺乏木料，現此間已作實騐，用木板箱裝頗為成功，希望出口商用木箱裝，因成本較低，而重量輕，易於搬運。</p>
<p>美國茶商今秋集會討論遭遇高價問題</p>
<p>〔又電」美茶業公會董事長裴恩，對中央社記者稱，中國茶葉之前途，仍欠光明，因目前茶市甚為紊亂，而中國茶葉於過表二十年內，至見表敗，而中國　後出口之茶葉，品質復欠佳。裴氏指出美國每年消費茶葉六千萬務，其中百分之八十　為印度及　籣所產。而美國每年所消費之茶葉中，中國及台灣所產之茶，僅達百分之二十。另一堪値在意之事實，即華茶在世界其他部份（北非及蘇聯或不在其內）之銷路亦不振。是以渠不知中國政府本年如何能指望輸出如許數量乏茶葉，蓋華茶無立即暢銷之大規模市塲也。記者詢及美國之大規模聯號雜貨商店，為何僅出售印度及錫蘭茶而無華茶？裴恩答謂，此由於印度及錫蘭茶葉係以科學方法長期培植而成者，故品質俱臻上紫。渠並謂美國茶商本秋將舉行全國大會，討論美國茶葉戰後所遭遇之高價問題。該大會將提出多項建　，定將涉及美國茶葉之未來政策及中國復興茶業三年計劃。美茶業公會共有會員一百零十家，包括包裝商，分配商，入口商，擔　及最大之聯號難貨店等。</p>
<h3>糧食恐慌已過去　洋米正運華川省亦豐收糧政當局稱米價已普跌</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕糧政當局，七日以　觀口吻告記者，糧食恐慌現象殆已過云，現各地糧價普遍下跌，短期內將纖下跌。據稱：目前可以樂觀之現象，至少在下列數點：（一）洋米大批來華，除美國救濟款項所購之卅萬　洋米外，國際食糧會議所撥歸中國之廿萬噸，亦正由中信局趕運中，自本月份起，每月至少可有七八萬噸運到。此外一中信局購運之小麥及麺粉，亦有廿萬噸。（二）四川今年豐收　出川米船日多，最近即有一船載來百餘噸，今後將續有大量運到。（三）安徵等省已解禁，鉅額皖米即可運來京·滬等地。（四）新麥已登塲。凡此，對調劑民食，當大有助。</p>
<h3>檢討察綏經濟</h3>
<p>張坦綏署峯行會議</p>

<h3>羅卓英王東原均予申誡處分</h3>

<h3>日領土野心復活　英菲輿論起反感　香港華文各報痛加評斥</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕日本領土野心之復活，使英國與論均起反感。最近報紙傳稱，日本　外交部官員承認有「收回」台灣之野心，尤使人認爲不合實際，良以開羅宣言，固已特別規定該島應交還中國也。同時，英外交部發言人於今晚表示，英國認千島羣島之移轉於蘇聯已成定讞，毌須再待遠東和約之批准。日外相蘆田最近曾在東京記者招待會上，表示日本將要求收回千島列島中之至少若干島嶼，並修正英美蘇三國領袖於一九四五年　茨担會議中對日本所宣布之土地條款。外交觀察家則曰，英國雖將視雅爾達密約關於千島列島讓與蘇聯之規定爲肯定的決定，然料日本或將主張盟國領袖於戰時發表之土地宣言，含義尙欠明晰，波茨坦宣言曾謂一九四三年開羅宣言之條件將予執行，而戰後日本之主權，僅能及於本土四大島及盟國所將決定之若干小島，此項規定，若與雅爾達密約配合，則千島列島，自不能繼　由日本保留。然日人或將主張開羅宣言對於波茨坦協定之內容，將有限制；開羅宣言，規定使日本交還一九一四年以來侵佔之土地，夺自中國之任何土地以及任何以武力奪取之土地，而千島列島，並不在前述之任何一類土地以內，蓋日本係依據一八七五年之聖彼得堡條約而以庫頁島之南部與俄國換得千島列島，日俄戰爭後，日本雖收回庫頁島之南部，但仍繼續佔有千島列島，英國對於日本此項主張之答辯，當爲波茨坦協定之規定，遇有與開羅協定之規定衝突時，應以前者爲據，而雅爾達協定，則具有絕對之拘束效力。</p>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼拉七日電〕此間對於日本新外相彥田之聲明殊表不滿。蘆田曾謂：日本希望與盟國締結對日和約時，保留琉球羣島，包括冲繩島在內。馬尼拉公報本日社評載稱：蘆田之注重「額外領土」，似較「恢復貿易爲佳。」蘆田希望收回琉球華島及千島列島，幷成立具有來復槍及機關槍之警察。蘆氏提及日本不致要求恢復其海陸軍時殊爲小心翼翼，但實際上含有「將來或有提出此項要求」之意云。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港七日電〕日本希冀與美國聯合管轄琉球羣島，以及欲享有對台灣之特別移民權二事，今日曾引起此間中國報紙之嚴厲批評。華僑日報於社論中稱：自古以來，琉球羣島即屬於中國，且開羅及波茨坦協定曾規定台灣及其他失地於戰後歸還中國。該報稱：琉球羣島及台灣永保爲中國土地之一部，不僅對於保護中國漫長海岸綫方面實屬重要，且對遠東和平之維持亦屬重要也。國民日報於揭破日本之雙重國格時稱：對中國領土之侵略，必須以各種方法予以制止。該報並警吿稱：琉球羣島在日本手中之戰略價値，或可能引致對中國領土完整及主權之進一步侵略。該報並提醒世人謂：日本在過去會利用台灣及琉球作爲南進基地，致引起第二次世界大戰。</p>
<h3>台參議員與國大代表决議　電請主席妥籌對策　擊破日人陰謀　台胞對日一致憤慨</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北七日電〕台省參議員與國大代表今日上午舉行聯席會議，討論日本企圖共管琉球及取得移民台灣特權問題，決議：電請蔣主席妥籌對策，擊破日人之陰謀。又台省參議會定於二十日召開第一屆第三次大會，台北市參議會今日下午已閉會，會中通過贊同魏主席之安定社會政策案，並決議組織內地考察團，由市參議員簽名參加，團員人數及行期均未定。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北七日電〕曾遭日本帝國主義者蹂躪半世紀以上之台胞，對於今日戰敗之日本，公然向戰勝國家表示無理之希求，企圖獲得其對台灣之移民特權，莫不深表憤慨。刻此一怪誕不經之新聞，業成台灣同胞日常助談資料，若干人士認爲今日迎頭打擊日本欲對台灣再事染指之有效措施，乃爲迅將現留台省之日僑七百十三人，即行全部遣送返日。此種主張，並不新頴，去年三月主張大批遣送日僑最烈者爲飽支日人壓迫之台省同胞，而非前台省公署之官員也。台省光復後，據日本統治台灣之總督府統計，台省日僑共有三十二萬三千二百五十九人，三十五年一月前，台省公署複査結果，日僑確數共爲三十二萬二千一百四十九人，另有駐台之日軍十八萬三千零七十九人。嗣經我國三次遣送，除日軍最先全部遣送外，現尙留居台灣之日僑爲七百一十三人，其中留用之技術人員二百六十人，眷屬四百五十三人。</p>
<h3>旅滬台胞通電要求嚴生抗議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台灣旅滬同鄕會代表旅滬台胞，請政府當局採取有效措置，防止日帝國主義之野心，特電呈國府主席行政院院長，台省府主席云：「日本希望與美國共同托管琉球羣島，在千島羣島及庫頁島附近取得捕魚權，並在台灣取得移民權」等語。此項記載，當非空穴來風，果　事實，則我六百萬台胞將重淪於奴隸，而國家主權被侵害，其恥辱恐更甚於甲午割台時矣。爲今之計，切望我政府迅予査明眞相，果有其事，應即提出嚴重抗議，一面催召和平會議，堅特波茨坦軍言之規定，將其領土權限列入重要議程，以杜絕其移民藉口，務使武力侵略者不得重施其狡猾技倆而後已。此不獨全台民衆五十年來含羞忍垢，爲祖國爭光之熱忱，藉以保全，想亦全中華民國一致同情者也。本會同人目覩情勢日益險惡，憂心火焚，亟電鈞府迅作有效措置，以維國際威信，而慰民望，臨電迫切，不勝待命之至，合灣旅滬同鄕會理事長李偉光　全體會員叩魚。」</p>
<h3>台南紙漿廠開工</h3>

<h3>中立國在日工廠　完全充作賠償　麥克阿瑟接獲訓令</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京七日電〕今日權威方面息：美國參謀長聯席會議，爲遠東委員會訓令麥帥非僅以在日本之日人與敵人工業爲賠償，且以中立國在該國之工廠充作賠償。自賠償宣佈以來，麥帥接　遠東委員會關於賠償問題之明確命令尙屬首次。參謀長聯席會議之命令，開列日本軍事工業及支持軍事工業爲首須解除之工業，「財　」工業亦列入優先賠償名單中。上列種種工業移除後，盟總有權得以敵國在日本建立之工業，充作賠償。該項命令，並令麥帥選擇最完整之工廠作賠償，如此，可免要求國家取得破舊不堪甚至不復可用之工廠，權威人主主面稱：遠東委員會之新命令，將不致對於麥帥爲賠償問題自日本投降後所作之努力大加干涉。彼等指出：麥帥賠償計劃，迄今大致運照遠東委員會新訓令所規定者。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>社會安全運動</h3>
<p>昨天上海市各界組織「社會安全促進會」，在上海市商會開成立大會，喊出「主持正義，擁護好人」的呼聲。這呼聲是響亮的：這運動是積極的。我們須得重視這件社會上的大事。</p>
<p>社會安全是戰時以及戰後各國人民共同的要求，亦且是每個進步的政府孳孳努力以求實現的政策。而在中國，尤其是經濟文化重心所在的上海，社會安全更是每個人民所欲喊出的呼聲。但這迫切的呼聲如何可以見諸事實，還是値得我們深長硏討。許多耆老賢達旣經發此宏願，我們極盼他們能持之以恒，然後這一偉大而有意義的社會安全運動，方可期其如火如荼的展開。</p>
<p>要獲得社會安全，必先明瞭今天社會之所以感到不能安全的原因所在。戰亂延續，和談絕望，綱紀掃地，威信蕩然：這是政治的不安因素。物價高昻，民生困苦，農村破產，工業瀕危；這是經濟的不安因素。民氣頹唐，道德毁棄，賢良隱通，暴戾横行：這是社會的不安因素。喪失自信，依賴性成，誤會自由，曲解民主：這是文化的不安因素。心理變態，社會畸形，猜忌成風，鬥爭是務：這是心理的不安因索。積此種種因素，交互錯綜，以結成複雜的綜合的社會不安之果。我們如確想促進社會安全，並進而確保社會安全，必須羣策羣力，劍及履及，同時從各方面一齊下手，把這許多病根痛快革除。</p>
<p>今天救社會，救國家，千言萬語，必先要求大家拿出良心來！這就是孟子所說的致良知，亦郎陽明先生所說的知行合一。而今日國家之大患，更在於自好之士（卽所謂好人）大都只知消極的潔身，不肯挺身而出，團結起來，担當持顚扶危的大任。此固或由於當道求賢之未盡其誠，只知在少數若干黨派中去找，不知向廣大的社會裏去誠意搜求，而大半也因爲政府無賞罰，社會無是非，於是正氣消沉，大局敗壞。其實，無時無人才，無地無賢者，所謂「百步之內，必有芳草，十室之邑，必有忠信」：我們只須在每一個地方，鼓勵有血性有正氣的人們，携手團結，挽回頹風，社會卽可安定，政治必漸淸明。看滌生氏所謂風俗之原薄，視乎一二人之心之所嚮，也就是這個道理。今天我們可說是已到了社會沉淪與社會安定的歧途，國家危亡與國家復興的分界，嚴重危險的程度，不容我們輕視了！如果社會領導人物遝持往日故態，或只知苦悶慨歎，或竟憤激横決，而不以積極的態度，從政治，經濟，社會，文化，心理各方面，設法解除民生疾苦，澄淸政治風氣，則國家前途，誠恐不堪設想。我們所以重視昨天上海發動的社會安全運動者，其意義實在此？</p>
<p>最後，願更爲政府當局進一言：前傳六月二日的驚濤駭浪，固然過去了，但當局切勿以爲便可高枕無憂，尤其不可誤認爲危機到來，一聲戒嚴便可得心應手，措置裕如。須知洪水之所以激成，必有其稻種因緣；假使在急流湧過以後，不知疏導治本，轉眼再遇險象，必將較前更爲洶湧，而堤防之效一失，勢非潰決泛濫不止！故今日大局，決非當局可以慶幸組吿安定之時，而正宜官民合作，聚精會神，開誠心，布公道，明是非，辨邪正，以平閭閣不平之氣，治貧富不均之癌，然後不僅社會安全可保，卽整個國家亦不難撥亂反正，實睹昇平。我們深願上海市的社會安全運動，能够影饗全國，使政府明瞭眞正民意的歸趨，而決定他們如何與民更始的政策！</p>

<h3>裁軍討論無結果　蘇聯獨持異議形成僵局</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖六日電〕聯合國　　軍備委員會之小組委員會，經五次會議之後，中·英·美·蘇·法五強仍未能在美蘇兩國所提出工作計劃之間，有所抉擇，不得不承認不能成立協議，而將此一問題交還裁减軍備委員會討論。蘇聯計劃，僅有蘇聯一國贊成，此在中·英·美·法四國，則贊成美國之計劃。美國之計劃所列舉之事項，頃由裁减軍備條約委員會討論以擬就裁軍計劃，此在蘇聯之計劃，則主張先成立原子能管制制度，然後始能裁减一般軍備。小組委員會乃在完全僵持狀態中散會。裁軍委員會現定於星期三舉行全體會議，重新從頭討論裁軍問題云。</p>
<h3>對國際警備軍問題葛羅米柯闡明立塲　與中英美法意見相左</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖六日電〕蘇代表葛羅米柯今日吿安全理事會稱：關於軍事參謀委員會組織國際警備軍之報吿，意見殊爲不同，蘇聯仍堅決主張下列諸要點；（一）五强參加國際警備軍之軍隊，數量及組織必須相等；（二）國際警備軍數額以小爲原則；（三）不得令聯合國會員國供給國際警備軍之　地；（四）參加國際警備軍之聯合國會員國軍，祗能駐在本國境內；（五）國際警備軍於完成其任務後，應於三十日內自執行任務地撤退；（六）供給國際警備軍之聯合國會員國應供給其本國軍隊所需之配備及給養。關於國際警備車之數量，渠認於德日戰敗以後，已毋需保持巨額之國際警備軍，且聯合國全體大會已有裁軍之決議，故安全理事會目前祗須保留比較小額之國際警備軍即可。葛羅米柯復曰：基地之要求與聯合國機構主要任務之一，即發展並加强國際善鄰關係相抵觸。如於設立國際警備軍時規定基地之供給，將構成國際摩擦之原因，妨礙友好關係之建立。最後渠並力言聯合國會員國所供給之國際警備軍，祗能駐在本國之領土或領水內，葛羅米柯前述之諸點，均與中英美法四强之意見相反。</p>

<h3>盟軍登陸法國三週紀念　杜魯門發表演說　謂美須維持實力藉以應付事變</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山七日廣播：杜魯門總統於盟軍登陸法國三週紀念日在坎萬斯城向參戰軍人發表演說稱「吾人茍欲支持聯合國，必須維護世界和平所署之原則，即世界上任何民族應有在民選機構下自由生存不受侵略威脅之權利。吾人　導世界各民族爭取和平，所採取之方式為協助　　民族改進或建設自由獨立之國家。吾人惟有保持吾人這實力，始能履行吾人維護和平之義務。有和平之意向而無和平之實力，無濟於事。」</p>
<p>渠繼稱：「自德日兩國投降以來，吾人之軍隊實行解散，是不啻鼓勵若干國家利用愛好和平國家之弱點而存侵略之野心。遂使與吾人思想相同步伐一致，但物資或人力匱乏之各國，對於吾人維護主義之信心漸次失墜。希特勒統治世界之迷夢，實由渠深信他國缺乏抵抗意志所造成。希民佔計民主國家之實力日漸削弱，其備戰之心亦態切。一九三九年希氏窺破敵人毫無準備，益堅其進軍波蘭之決心。日本認爲美國實力不能反攻，故胆敢進攻珍珠港。是故吾人必須維持陸海空軍之實力，藉以應付非常事變。陸海空軍之組織，應爲單獨强大之軍事組織，且必有訓練有素之後備軍。不寗惟是，吾人更須有健全繁榮之經濟體系，發達之農業，充分發展之天然資源，以及富有責任心及自信力之國民」云。</p>
<h3>艾帥勗勉軍人保持堅定信心</h3>
<p>〔聯合社坎薩斯市六日電〕陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威今日在第卅五師懇親會上致詞稱：吾人擬不顧「他國敵視」，繼續擁護覓求自身和平生活之人民，堅定不渝。艾氏並未指明蘇聯，僅稱「他國」之漠視甚或敵視，決不能改變吾人認爲正當之路綫。茍無美國領導，億兆人民間立即將有社會，政治以及經濟上之大混亂。艾氏並提及三年前今日即爲聯合國軍隊在諾曼第登陸之日。第卅五師乃第二次世界大戰中由艾帥率領在歐洲作戰軍隊之一部，第一次世界大戰時渠曾在該師任砲兵軍官。杜魯門總統定於明晚向該師官兵發表演說。</p>

<p>至於今後當局對於公用事業價格之方針，據趙局長昨發表：對價格之調整，將採漸進方式，故下月份或將再席調整，據稱「依吾人之理想，將來最好根據生活指數，材料價格，及外匯率，採用自動調整方式。因公用事業絕對必須維持，且須逐步發展，不能任其衰落。」</p>

<h3>空軍人員一批　學成返國抵滬　在美曾受分科嚴格訓練</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國在美受訓之空軍人員一批二百十二人，昨日下午三時乘奧德門將軍號輪（General　Aujtman）返國抵滬。記者趨訪領隊馬復寬少校及隊員周定才中尉，與談渠等在美受訓情形，據稱：此次返國之空軍官兵，大部係地勤人員，有係抗戰後期在昆明貴陽等地投考取錄者，有係在空軍機械學校挑選者，在美分別受專門科目之訓練，如機械，空中攝影，砲術，螨準器，醫生等等。訓練期間視科目之不同而有長短，如機械科科在二年上，其他至少亦有八個月左右。所有受訓官兵抵美後，首先須在德薩斯州之聖安東尼受三個月入伍訓練，其嚴格之程度，遠過於國內。體格稍差者頗多病倒。入伍訓練完畢後，即分發至密西西比，德薩斯，伊利諾，克勞拉斯各州之機塲中學習專門科目。訓練方式注重實習而少理論，然管敎極爲認真。估計每小時之敎材費用須美金二三十元左右。渠等在美生活費用由我政府發給，軍官階級每月自美金一百四十元至一百九十元，學生士兵每月六十元左右。但學生士兵之衣服膳食等大部由營中供給，而軍官則一切自理，並須維持身份，參加交際，故反有「啞子吃黃蓮」之苦。美邦人士對彼等之態度，因國內內戰關係已大有改變，常有人以「中國勝利後爲何還要內戰」爲訽，致使彼等閉口無言，甚感痛苦。此次返國後，將候空軍總部分派工作，至於現時繼續在美受訓者，尚有三百人左右，另有已訓練完成之百餘人，短期內亦將陸續返國。</p>

<p>調配委會明日成立</p>
<p>〔又訊〕吳開先氏昨稱：民食調配會決於九日正式成立，委員九人名額，待由九機關推出決定。貧民平糶，本月份決可實施，已請各區公所尋覓平糶站地點。本月份糧食部所撥之十八萬七千祖食米，除用於學校工廠配米外，即依貧民人口比例，平均分配於全市卅一區，由各警察分局及區公所主持平糶。</p>
<p>米市下瀉麺粉亦跌</p>
<p>〔又訊〕米市昨繼續行客雖多，然因市銷峧淡，店胃告疲，故開盤後即一蹶不振。至收布止，各貨再較上日跌去一二萬元。各帮到貨登記，計兩市七一二〇石，北市一八九〇石。高白粳南市做四十二萬元，北市四十一萬元。薄稽四十二三萬元，早稻四十萬元及四十萬另五千元，蕪秈二十九萬元，羊秈卅六萬元及卅六萬五千元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨白元因端午將近，店方備銷，另化尙活，市形堅挺。惟中下者仍少顧主。麵粉消化淸閒，纖讀猛跌五六千元。麩皮挺定，小包浙省略動，同升二三千元。豆餅鄉銷有動，市形挺站，營口餅見升一二千元。黃豆供求兩平，無所榮辱。菉豆萎靡不振，再跌在五千元。赤豆交易寥寥，步削五六千元。</p>
<p>紅糧續疲一二千元，苞米間津甚少，一蹶不振，續瀉萬元。芝蔴洋莊納靑蟬聯，高而愈固，節節上漲，再加萬元。</p>
<p>新菜子初見，市况因油市不振，隨之下游。新蠶豆高貨另星略動，暫平之格。中下仍少顧主。新小麥廠方納胃市形平正。</p>
<p>油市則互有參差，生油回跌萬元，豆汕相仿，菜油平平，惟小車蔴油見升一二萬元。</p>
<p>又傳聞漢口米糧即將實行開放，而江西方面見新最早，亦將逐步開禁。湘米價格又低，四川已經流通，米糧危期已過，新麥漸漸見多，民食必可充沛。</p>

<h3>人絲綢貨均跌　廠經交易甚淸淡</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲繼續下跌，趨勢疲莫能興，一週內已降落二百萬元，昨一二〇號高山有光開盤即小，一千八百五十萬元有成交。中午收盤喊六十萬元賣出，下午更形虛弱，　後咸八百三十萬元賣出價，比上日小八十萬元。東洋牌子喊八百五十萬元，七五號半光亦小五十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市交易仍淸淡，喊價大致堅特，故開D字等級價二千四百七十萬元，有幾天期頭。高級另担亦稍有成交，價做四百五十萬元，其餘各級及干經，俱乏正式交易。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨因値週末，故眞絲被面及格子擊總做開價均比上日略短。大誠被面九百三十五萬元，華强被面九百二十萬元有交易，格子　續棧單，開市最小做三萬四千二百元，收市做四千六百元，週一期做五千元，無光紡去胃漸淡，故市價漸見低落。</p>

<h3>晉京交涉無結果華股昨再度崩潰</h3>
<p>華股昨低後會轉盤局，嗣因晋京接治無結果，近午再度崩潰。遞交永紗　跌停限度甚微，火柴且告跌停，各小型股雖跌而有限，交易寥寂，人心渙散。晨開見低小許，遞永紗開後，二四號八五號四七號七一號三一號二一八號二二三號二二四號賣到五八五〇元。八三號六五號一七九號七五號三六號趁低進至五九六〇元，四七號二二三號二二四號再賣到五八五〇元。六一號六五號九一號一七七號一四八號八九號一六三號一五四號一一二號俱進，一五一號並購現永紗，一度將遞永紗拉上至六一〇〇元。二三五號三六號二二四號一五五號逢高了結，回跌至五九〇〇元內。此時因港申電報來仍為十四元四，人心尙定。一五二號一九〇號尙進，會扳高至六〇〇〇元關外，十一時後，聞顧協理業已返申，所携提案，未獲批准，人心恐慌，多方念斬，交易少，六五號四六號一七一號二二四號一四一號一八六號二二三號二三四號一四三號等，一再脫售，形成供過於求之勢，近午將遞永紗迫低至五五六〇元，此價迫近跌停限度。火柴由六九號掛抵至跌停板。各小股雖降而多盤，一六二號一二九號二〇七號乘低稍納，午收在五六〇〇元左右掙扎，收後喊價尙平。結果較前收計即交各股永紗信和永公中法各跌一成左右，華豐新光景福勤興各低半成，新華獨平，火柴跌至限度，大通跌停後有回，軋低半成，水泥跌一成不到，統益中絲景綸新亞內衣商務各挫半成，中紡麗安雖跌而不多。遞交各股計永紗信和華　各跌一成光景，新光永公勤　景　各跌半成，塲外各老股再告降低。</p>
<h3>統債平穩外股盤旋</h3>
<p>公債昨初疲後穩，大戶董某力納四百餘萬，散戶之供給不多，有以致之。統丙晨開六八〇〇元，此後即告盤旋而高，升至八七〇〇元後，始轉平定。結果與前收相較，計各債升降俱微，成交約六七百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨洋商雖納而不多，證券帮仍具　胃，銀行帮有售，港申電報十四元四，予市面無甚影響。怡紗優開六一〇〇〇元，自六一五〇〇元起，盤低至五七〇〇〇元而後轉盤。結＼果較前收計怡紗鋼業徵降，英聯會德興業廣紙業怡啤航業各跌半成。</p>
<h3>經紀人認購美金債劵　財部不許變更原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所協理　善昌，為經紀人認購美金債券事，於五日晋京請示財經兩部，業於昨晨八時許返滬。承語記者：此次晋京，已將經紀人方面意見，與財部戴司長，經部鄧司長治商一過。當局表示：對經紀人目前所感受之痛苦，均深切暸解。惟兩部所決定之辦法，原則上不能變更。在處置辦法方面，則不妨候兩部會商後，再正式函示證交查照。又四種申請上市股票，亦特都審核中。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕財經兩部駐證交監理官王鱉堂吳公警兩氏，業於昨晨與顧善昌氏同車返滬。</p>
<h3>為限額分配民等問題　輸管會發表聲明　廠商登記標準係執委會規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會昨對：（一）附表二進口商登記審核事宜，（二）附表二輸入品分配事宜有所聲明，茲摘誌大要如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於附表二貨品因限額不敷分配，不得已須辦理一甲請人之登記，蓋深恐不患寡而患不均。但一般廠商往往因登記不及格，而發生誤會。然據該會稱，該會登記標準係經該會執委會一再審愼考慮始予規定，登記科根據標準執行審查。截至本年五月底止，各項貨品之登記，廠商共五百餘家，其中十分之六，為本國廠商，十分之四為外商。所謂偏護洋商一點，乃　毫無根據。至於每類登記廠商之名册，存在登記科，隨時可供參閱。</p>
<p>（二）關於第一季限額貨品之分配，截至目前止，除人造絲及蔴袋二項外，其餘各貨中，米，小麥，麥粉三稱，由政府統籌。煤及焦炭一種，由燃管會分配。硫酸铔，水泥，肥料，製藥四種，暫停輸入。此外需要分配之貨品，均已分別辦理。</p>
<p>分配之標準如下：（一）凡工業原料，需要集中者，均直接分配予工廠用戶，由同業公會審核各家能力，集中消費之貨品，均分配與登記合格進口商，由本處召集各進口商公開協議，當塲決定配額。因貨品情况各不相同，有以一九四六年進口量為標進者，有參酌戰前進口數量者，有以一小部份平分，餘按議定標準分配者，亦有顧及各商經營罷力者，更有規定一最低額，餘按標準計算者。</p>
<p>以上種種分配，均係各商自行協議決定，故無强同之可能與必要。但核定配額後之工業貨品，規定必須售與用戶，取得銷售合同，並經與買方同業公會副署證明，方予核准。</p>
<h3>開灤煤將運滬</h3>
<p>經濟部燃料管理委員會，積極疏導煤斤來源工作，先從開　着手，預料本月底至少可獲得開　煤十萬噸至十二萬噸抵滬。其改　經過，以該會鑒於唐山　區及　津鐵路局需要麪粉甚為迫切，業經呈准政院，由糧食部着中央信託局發售所存外洋數粉若干，以資鼓勵，而謀取合作上種種便利。其方法如每月運滬煤斤十萬噸，則由中信局照市價運售利郎粉八萬包與開　當局，另售四萬包　平　鐵路局。如　滬煤斤之總數量超出限額，則對以上兩機構規定每一　煤斤另各加售麪粉一萬包。</p>
<p>按開　出產豐富，平均每日約計一萬四千噸，存貨亦達二十萬噸以上，再按上海方面按月經常需要量為十六萬噸至十七萬噸，並以東北台灣各地來源補充，煤荒問題不載解徐云。</p>
<h3>外銷茶微露曙光陳茶一批將退回</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國茶葉，目前海外依然靑睞，惜出價異常苛刻，致外銷久解起色。邇來若干家華商出口行，為積極展開去路起見，雖無利可圖，繼續忍痛輸出，致沉靜多時之洋莊交易，昨仍微霧曙光。各種內銷茶，本街及客帮均又華詢，過程尙佳，人心頻穩，行情則比前略帶緊倘。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕最近市上盛傳國外將有十餘萬磅華茶退　我國，記者為此，昨特走訪某茶葉鉅子，據告：確係事實，蓋以數月前本市某茶業出口行，竟將陳久多年之變質陳茶，裝運海外。聞該茶一經抵達，未能受彼地人歡迎，目前乃擬裝回我國。依現狀觀察，際此華茶日趨末落而我國茶商竟毫不憬悟，前途可危。</p>
<h3>派貨多消化細　香煙頹勢難挽</h3>
<p>昨日香煙市況，塲內賣氣仍濃，同業添補不暢，市上銀根又緊，置戶觀望。做開十支大英烟六百廿五萬元，交易甚淸，即步小至十五萬元，方有零星吸納。老刀亦乏去化，午後又傳永泰和下週續辦本埠同行派貨，和成公司亦派銷廿支「鐵塔」牌烟，行盤五纖支展為四百萬元，以致市氣更形萎靡，交易亦淡。十支大英烟收價又步小至六百十一萬元，比上日　跌十五萬五千元。老刀烟亦步跌十八萬五千元，五華平定，其餘美貨條烟及大南未大三砲等，均鮮進屬，惟華商烟熱銷貨脚地較硬云。</p>
<h3>五金呆滯</h3>
<p>本週五金售價終未見起色，雖廠商工資增加，所出貨品亦隨提高，終因實銷呆滯，欲漲無力矣。</p>
<h3>國藥平穩</h3>
<p>國藥市況上升以後，旋轉平穩之勢。終以去路呆滯，物價轉疲，高價藥品，頗感燙手云。</p>
<h3>紗布續吿疲挫</h3>
<p>昨日紗市因紗廠　有拋售，兼以美棉進口匯款已有辦法，客帮　吸懈怠，本省需求亦淸，　價遂告　　。四二支藍鳳紗最後價為一千二百五十五萬元，比上日再跌三十五萬元。十十支雙馬初開尙堅，為七百七十五萬元，旋以交易不暢，人心閑散，收時跌小至七百六十五萬元，比上日亦降十三萬元。其餘各支紗亦跟小二三十萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨日棉布開市平穩，旋因染纖家以加工印染不合算，吐售白坯細布，本客二帮又以六底及端節轉　將屆，銀根漸聚，且鄉間農忙時期，實銷淸淡，全日市氣除當令布疋尙能站定外，十二碎各檔細布一致下挫二三千元至五千餘元。　布斜紋嗶嘰等一律軋小二三千至六七千元不一。</p>
<h3>棉花市況</h3>
<p>昨美棉電訊均見高翔，印棉平定，滬市現棉因銀根未鬆，交易不甚暢達，祇恒豐紗廠購進半月期之沙市及老湖口花各一百包，嘉豐紗廠進靈寳花一百十八包，脚地亦頗堅穩。</p>
<h3>國行工貸委員會核准貸款卅五億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會工業貸款審核委員會，於日前下午三時舉行會機，出席朱通九等十四人，討論審核申貸案件卅二起，共核准廿一起，核准貸額共卅五億四千萬元。駁同七起，緩議四起。</p>

<h3>長春大動員　保衛戰中新的鏡頭</h3>
<p>— 長春二日航訊　本報記者方仁</p>
<p>長春已成了一個鐵的都市，這鋼鐵一般的氣質，不僅表現在工事上，而且襯際地還表現在士氣與人心方面。</p>
<p>恰當國軍收復了長春足滿一週年的月份—五月，松花江北岸的共軍繼春天「四下江南」之後，又發動了第五次攻勢，所謂夏季攻勢，如共軍俘處所稱：「五下江南」。</p>
<p>長春是松花江南岸的名城，正和松花江北岸的哈爾濱一樣，都使人聽得震耳欲聾。共軍旣「下江南」，長專便首當其衝。於是，在五月的東北的原野中，風剛颳錄了樹枝，湖水河流剛剛解凍未久，泛起了漣漪碧波，靑蛙在月夜下奏起了天籟之聲，農人剛犁平了田畦，趕緊播種的現在，而松北共車鳴起了號角，烽火在原野中燃起，殺人盈野的狂浪，從長春西北角的扶餘，而到了農安的伏龍泉，五月十七日便南下捲沒了中長路公主嶺迤西的重鎭懷德，十九日竟自越過了公主嶺和公主嶺北段的范家屯。這時，長春三面受圍，市區靠西邊緣大房身的飛機塲，及屬於市區北部的寬城子，通統展開了激戰，槍聲砲聲，淸晰地，一連數日，掠渦長春市空。</p>
<p>多少不平凡的經騐</p>
<p>長春人是受過驚駭的，在他們充滿了不平凡的經驗之中，雖然春天裏曾遭遇過共軍四次攻勢，他們並不曾聽到有過這次密而且響的槍聲砲聲，也不曾感受過有這次太令人窒息的氛圍，但去今未遠的客歲，像「五二三」，「四一四」，乃至自前年「八一五」光復後直到去年的「五二三」那一段長期混沌的歲月中，像這次長春三面受圍所遭受的威脅，簡直是等而下之，遜色多多。因爲這次就未見到過去年「四一四」當中所見到的「老虎坦克」。</p>
<p>可是，這是一個太令人受到感動的鏡頭，前此還未見過的長春人所發動的保衛大長春偉大的動員。</p>
<p>四天造成空軍基地</p>
<p>在抗戰時期聽到爲人所高呼的「有力出力，有錢出錢」的口號，長春這次不僅做到了「有力出力，有錢出錢」，而且還做到了「有錢的出力」。</p>
<p>他們自動地做了許多輸將的事情之後，而在市府於五月廿四日—長春收復週年紀念日的次一天，一聲令下，並不勉强地竟動員了十萬人民，在熱情橫溢之下，四天之內，於市區警戒綫內修起了一個遠較重慶珊瑚　爲大的空軍基地，和圍繞市區警戒綫外極目望不盡的深溝高壘的防禦工事。這種工事，他們稱之爲「壕」，到記者寄稿時，雖尙未竟其全功，但百分之九十五的工程，業已全部竣事。</p>
<p>新行動的潛在力量</p>
<p>參加這工程的，是自十八歲起到五十一歲止的長春市民，他們中有店員，有工匠，有學生，有公務員，有老粗，也有大學敎授。他們全都手把着鋤頭，揮舞着，在派種情景下，使人不期然而然的領悟到「衆志成城」這句成語的意境。除此之外，還要使人領悟到那不尷不尬的幾月，賦予了他們今日行動的潛在的力量，即前年「八一五」直至去年的「五二三」那一段長期混沌的時間，稱下了對某些野心者難忘的，厭惡與憤恨。</p>
<p>長春在本文截稿時止，還不能說不在保衛戰進行之中。戰火從松江流域延燒到了遼河平原，整個東北，很少地方不聽到號角之聲，但是，長春已成了一個鐵的都市，這「鐵」不僅表現在工事上，而實際還表現在士氣與人心上！</p>

<h3>豫省一片氷雹　大者如鷄卵小者似杏棗　遍地是哀鴻盼有效救濟</h3>
<p>— 開封二日訊　本報通訊員博泉</p>
<p>豫省戰禍慘重，人民顚沛流離，在此時期，許昌·武陟·鎭平·　師等縣，近又冰雹迭降，大如鷄卵，小如棗杏。二麥將熟，遭此奇災，民生將何以堪？茲將各縣冰雹情形，彙誌如次：</p>
<p>許昌　城東北鄕最慘居民大哭不憶</p>
<p>十六日下午，冰雹成災，情况餒東。城東北鄉八龍·小召·五節等鄉縝，房屋被冰雹打毀者甚多，田禾什九被毀。遍地哀鴻，慘不忍睹。冰雹大者如胡桃。菜畦內冰雹，可與畦龍相平。距城五里之石碑，陳莊，百餘間房屋，即被打毀九十餘間。合抱之大樹，亦被擊倒。該村陳姓居民，僅種麥田八畝，今被打毀，昨日來至城中，大哭不止，意圖自盡，聞者酸鼻。</p>
<p>武陟　降雹二十分鐘厚二寸寬六里</p>
<p>縣東古陽鄉，本月十七日下午二時餘，在風大作，突降冰雹，大如杏棗，濃密下傾，亘二十分鐘，地面所集冰雹，厚及二寸，面積寬約六里，長約十五里。所有二麥，盡被打毀。麥收絕望，人民號天哭地，尤以担負奇重糧價飛漲，生活大起恐慌。災重面積約三百頃，其餘較輕地區，亦多麥穗落地，秀而不實，深望當局設法予以救濟，减輕民間負担</p>
<p>鎭平　黑霜已降三次冰雹竟亦肆虐</p>
<p>本月二十日，雷雨大作，冰雹驟降，勢極兇猛，尤以城垣·彭營·杏山·禹廷諸鄉鎭爲最嚴重，大如拳卵，小若杏棗，人畜均有傷亡。二麥，菀豆及早秋，毀損無餘，人民號啼，狀極悲慘。鎭平二月間已降黑霜三次，今又降冰雹，人民實無法生活，待救孔股，亟盼當局予以有效救濟，以維生計。</p>
<p>偃師　麥穗吹落大半薯棉受損殊鉅</p>
<p>大小二麥，已屆成熟時期，不意五月十五日狂風驟起，一晝夜之間，麥穗被吹落者，竟達太半。迄十六日下午止，大風不特益烈，竟復降下冰雹，大若杏子，所有麥子，紅薯，棉花等，受損甚鉅，據初步調査，尤以邙嶺一帶爲尤甚。</p>

<h3>談聲樂欣賞</h3>
<p>— 酉廷</p>
<p>自蔣英獨唱會蹄來，我只覺得以我這樣淺薄的音樂知識及聽覺經騐，來批評她底演唱成續是談不上的，但是因此却引起了我底一些關於「聲樂欣賞」的感想。</p>
<p>了解歐洲正統歌唱藝術，不是人畫具備的本能而是一種學問</p>
<p>一般中國總衆，往往更喜歡京劇中的「靑衣」，而不大歡迎「抒情女高音」；尤其是歌劇中的「咏歎調」（Aria），及「宜叙調」（Recitativ）簡直敎他們急壞了——儘管那是世界聲樂的最高技巧。</p>
<p>不論歐洲藝術歌或歌劇中主要人物所唱的「咏歏調」，那些歌詞都常常是義文·德文·法文·或俄文的（英美對音樂藝術沒有特別的貢獻），倘使聽衆對歐洲語文沒有相當根底，那麽對那些歐洲正統歌曲的演唱，自然會「充耳而不知所云」了。例如蔣小姐獨唱會節目中就包括了德國莫差特（按莫氏父爲德人，莫本人則生長於奥國）法國比才養國晉契尼與凡爾第的歌劇作品。當你厠身於一個獨唱會中即使不能精通數國文字，至少對那些語言的發音，或者那些歌詞的英鐸大意，要弄淸楚，然後你才知道獨唱者底咬字是否淸晰，發音是否準確？感情運用是否適當？</p>
<p>聲樂演唱會，大都以歌劇中的「咏歏調」爲主體，倘若你平常毫不關心西洋文學的史略及其和音樂結合的關係，更不曉得歌劇內容取材自那部文學作品或取自那段希臘神話，你又怎會欣賞這些歌劇選曲的演唱？蔣英獨唱會的節目就包括莫差特之「費加羅的結婚」，凡爾第之「行吟詩人」（troviatore）比才之「卡門」等歌劇中的「咏歎調」，這些都是十八世紀以後近世與現代的歌劇名作家，一個獨唱會少不了這些偉人的作品。聽純正藝術的獨唱會，得多少有些文學知識，不像聽抗戰歌曲或舞塲音樂那樣省事。</p>
<p>有一種觀念是不健全的：認爲中國人又何必儘學外國歌？我想藝術不該有國家界限，那一種東西在世界文化中地位最高，技巧最進步，它便是人類所共有的，無所謂那一國。</p>
<p>德國和義大利的音樂藝術，畢竟爲人類文化放射出了光彩，我們總不能因爲那些技藝是源出外國，而以爲不値得研習，即使是英美，也從來未作如此想。</p>
<p>（如果以中西歌曲作比較，那麽我們的語言發音就根本吃了虧，是比不上的。）</p>
<p>其次，欣賞一個獨唱會，還需要對於聲樂方法與技巧的了解。這了解並不是你主觀所認爲的聲調是否淸脆，歌喉是否婉　就「蓋棺論定」地來決定獨唱者的成績。如果是一個「抒情女高音」，你該聽得出她底音色，音量是否稱職，你該知道「抒情女高音」與「戲劇化女高音」的區別。在這一方面，蔣英是頗爲稱職的。</p>
<p>在蔣將小如獨唱的第一隻曲子格拉克的「情燄」中，你該要發現她對於歐洲歌唱藝術的「試金石」——「昔與音之間柔美的聯繫」是怎樣應用。然後你可以批評。</p>
<p>此外，對於「顫音」，「間斷音」，「貫音」等等技巧的處理，感情演變的應用，都須具有相當判斷力。這判斷力不是上帝所給予而是靠你耳朶的經騐及天賦的「音樂靈敏度」。</p>
<p>往往，獨唱會的本身是成功的，但是台下却翁些人是來見見塲面或聞聞花香的。（按：獨唱會中，歌台上堆滿了花籃，淸香撲鼻。）</p>
<p>從最膚淺的角度來欣賞蔣君獨唱，我們可以領略到獨唱者對於歌唱姿勢與情感運用的如何老練。在第一個節目中她採用普通姿勢（兩手在前緊握，上下移動），恰恰顯示曲子讚頌偉大「愛情」的熱衷。唱第二個曲子「夕陽頌」時調子十分平和，她底姿態也放鬆了，右手輕扶鋼琴，左手自然下垂，在最後被喊（Encore）而增唱兩隻中國道地民謠「道情」與「鳳陽花鼓」時，她底表情，動作，更甘美可愛，使人意識到她對歌劇的修養。感情方面，她也做到了「把自己從歌詞中所得到的情感刺激，溶解在每個音符中，」因此全曲進行中，顯出了濃淡深淺。這雖是很表面的條件，却爲每個聲樂家所不易達於盡善盡美的技藝。</p>
<p>因蔣英底獨唱使我想起了聲樂技藝之難以及欣賞之不易。</p>

<h3>觀蕭淑芳女士畫展　（兩題）</h3>
<p>一·　孫秋草</p>
<p>初夏，正是江南草長的時節。沉寂許久的洋黨界，先後出現了幾位女作家的油畫展覽。繼大新畫廊唐蘊玉女士畫展之後，張荔英女士假法文協會圖書館舉行出國預展，態度純正，內容精　。現在蕙淑芳女士又將在靑年會　賡堂出展其近作。這些都是令人興奮的消息。</p>
<p>雖然，我們　處於苦難的時代。在這號稱全國經濟文化樞紐的上海，一切社會現象更顯得　澹的時候，一般人心目中對於美術，不過是一種奢侈的裝飾。而於洋畫的欣賞觀念，尤其淡薄。但是一個美術作者，在這樣窒息的環境裏，能够嚴肅自己，埋首於自己的工作，其誠勢忠一的態度，總是値得敬佩的。</p>
<p>蕭淑芳女士早歲出國，有過很長的時間硏攻繪事。因着作者平素對於園畫的技法已有很好的修養，再感染了啓發近代繪畫新意議的印象主義作風，其所表現的那種淸麗變化的格調，引起多數鑒賞者激賞。</p>
<p>從很多種構圖來看，作者特別鍾愛孩子和花朶。是的，這世界除了天眞無邪的孩子的笑　，和純潔無垢生意秀發的花朶，能够象徵快樂和平與安寧而外，還有比這些更使人從心底裏自然地湧起懷想來的麼。</p>
<p>可是，我們仍然侷處於苦難的時代，一切美麗的想像，掩飾不了我們由現實得來的慘痛。美術的領域是需要開拓的，美術與人生的關係是不可分離的。我希望美術作者披露他的眞情，應用各人不同的技術把它抒寫。即使不一定有這樣的成就，但不可不有這樣的胸襟。我愛惜每一個作者而不禁懷着這般苛求，對於蕭淑芳女士自然也不例外。這樣，對於一個技術上成功的作者，我的淺見或許不至於被目爲狂放的吧。</p>
<p>二·　與廬</p>
<p>記得民國廿八年春淑芳女士在倫敦舉行畫展的時候，我曾經寫過一篇通訊，寄在香港國民日報上發表，記遠其事。當時淑芳女士的作品，以水墨畫爲多，把中國美術的筆緻和作風，介紹於國際觀衆，頗博得倫敦社會人士一致的好評。可是淑芳女士在靑年會舉行畫展，在國內倒是第一次，也許一般社會人士對她尙很生疎，所以我在觀她這次畫展後，願意再來介紹一下。</p>
<p>蕭女士是已故前國立音樂院院長　友梅先生之侄女，自幼嗜好美術，曾在北平藝專及中大藝術系攻習，成績斐然，出國入巴黎及倫敦美術學院，益求深造。這次畫展中的油畫，便多在國外及歸國以後旅行間的作品，尤其她對瑞士和北平的風景，有深刻的愛好，在二十九輻風景畫中，兩地的寫生作品佔十七輻之多。其他在莫干山牯嶺，杭州·靑島以及巴黎·倫敦，亦多寫生作品，在水墨畫方面，風景畫亦有二十二輻之多，亦多爲寫生工作。</p>
<p>其次在人像方面，也無不維妙維肖，栩栩如生，其中最使我們嘆賞的，是地的小兒畫像，有坐的，有睡的，有吃奶的，把天眞爛漫的神情，都用筆勾出來而活躍紙上了。這次畫展中的人像，有油畫四輻，水墨畫十三輻，多半是不標價的，祗供觀衆欣賞而已。</p>
<p>在靜物方面，以花草爲多，尤其油寮的瓶花，大胆地用鮮艷的色彩，不惜刻意渲染，而仍不失其寫實逼眞的風緻。</p>
<p>蕭女士是一位天才美術家，現在不過是她走上藝術之宮的初步的階段，而在油畫水墨畫兩方面都已有高深的造就。我們應該鼓勵她，再下深工夫，多接受批評，使她的天才盡量發揮，亮晶晶地在中國美術界放一異彩。</p>
<h3>黃山畫家許士騏</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>士騏兄是多年的老朋友，他的大作我看到很多。然而我和他從普通同事進而為好朋友，却由於一件表面上與藝術無關的事，——甚而可以說與藝術矛盾的事。遠在抗戰以前，某天我去探望士騏兄。他向我道：『仲年兄，你來得正好，有樣東西你也許沒有見過。呶！』指着一堆血肉。粗看一下，好像是剝掉皮的兎子，然而他的頭吿訴我是一個新生小孩！那時他兼任衛生署生理模型科主任，他在解部。</p>
<p>當時我有一個感想：一切藝術以情感爲靈魂，一切科學以理智爲基石。一位藝術敎授去解剖，這個是不是矛盾？仔細一想，却又不然。情感不一定是盲目的。暫時放開美術不談，且看音樂，且看詩，這些是最重情感的。「藝」之外，尙有「術」：情感是音樂和詩的原動力，然而這種原動力的表達必須經過理智：情感和理智在此不相賊而相成。那麼，解剖室裏的許士騏何妨放下屠刀，立地到寳室裏去執筆繪畫呢？</p>
<p>把情感配合理智，是多麽可喜的事！能使情感與理智和諧無間，又是何等可喜可敬的人！因此我深刻瞭解士騏，對他的友誼更進一層。在他的畫面上，這種情感與理智和諧無間的精神充分發揮。構圖·用筆·色調等等，隨在理智化，却處處飽含情感。</p>
<p>他是黃山脚下的人：眼中有盡，心中有畫，對客發毫，畫赴腕底。於畫無所不能，尤念念不忘於黃山風景。翀鵬兄云：「許氏山水，喜作奇峯怪石，蒼松白雲，蓋其家鄉黃山風景；運筆蒼勁渾厚，與梅　山有異曲同工之妙。花烏出入呂紀·邊文進·新羅白陽之間。至於人物，則側重寫生，神采弈弈，得力於解剖學造詣，非偶然矣。」我對於這位剝嬰孩皮的黃山畫家，也作如此想。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血528</h3>
<p>葉勁風</p>
<p>半小時不到，正岩本人變了計劃，却沒有赶回百忍莊來參加會議，只用電話，把一條最重要的秘訊，吿訴鶴見；並請求鶴見，讓他待在電訊部守候其他消息，隨時通知。鶴見當然贊成正岩這個主張，並且誇獎他，學問眞正大進步了。</p>
<p>正岩這條重要秘訊乃由「〇十二」發來，說東京近衛別墅裏，現有兩個最大「力流」袋生「尖銳磨擦」；所謂兩個「力流」，當然指的海陸兩軍。因這磨擦，近衛的「出伐令」，只能暫時停頓。不過這個「暫時」也眞暫時極了，最多不過一兩小時，只等近衛手下，把海陸雙方　擦的原因和條件，折衝議妥，雙方定訂之後，出伐令立即可以簽發；中國方面的日倭駐軍，特務等，仍舊可以準時發動攻勢。</p>
<p>鶴見和百忍莊智囊團商討方案的當口，萍子一人，關在一所小客室內，佈置行術。同時小客室窗外，却有五六雙眼睛，潛伏暗處，灼灼地偸窺着。這五六雙眼睛　中，當然少不了四位淘氣，各人一雙，另加百忍莊男子當中，年紀最幼的弟弟唐冠一。他就是　君的同胞兄弟，百忍莊的電訊主管。</p>
<p>萍子的佈置很簡單，她把靑木長老的神秘信柬，貼在一面大方鏡子上，這面鏡子就安置在一張小圓桌上供着。桌上也放下紙筆等件，作爲記載靈感消息的準備。萍子本人佈置好了，把屋內的燈光熄去，就在桌前舖墊好了的一張方杌凳上跪坐着，靜默存想。</p>
<p>「老岳……老大哥，催眠術，或心靈術，或玄學，這些玩意兒，究竟是怎麽一回事呢？」</p>
<p>鶴見收到我的急電和其他雙方面的秘訊，從上海匆怱赶到北平，把上海經過一切吿訴我，說到萍子和覺厂老人，施用心靈術，探求靑木長老神秘書來的時俟，忽地這般問我。</p>
<p>「您有些相信不過，認爲太神秘，取太迷信，是不是？」我沒有給他解釋，反而這麼問着他。</p>
<p>「您說可信吧，我自己一百回試騐，就有一百零一回毫無靈騐……我吿訴您，老大哥，我這回到上海，還幹了一件醜事；也許您會不相信……」鶴見說到這裏，自己忽地在笑起來。</p>
<p>「什麽醜事呢？」</p>
<p>「您沒知道，在上海萍子失踪之後，想到此行任務，我可眞着急到了萬分。在國際大旅社裏，守一他們走了之後，那位洶氣小姐還沒來之前，我一時想到心靈感應的玩意兒，我想我爲什麽不用這個方法，探探萍子的下落？好在萍子對我施過術，我也用術反抗過，我們應當彼此心靈相通。想到這事，當下就自己催眠起來。您知道結果怎樣？」</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？」我好奇地問他。</p>
<p>「催去催來，一點感應也沒有，反而弄得呼呼睡熟了……」（鶴見）</p>
<p>「那也許由於您太疲倦的關係吧」</p>
<p>「可是您要不去信這玩意，却又有些可怪。只說這回在百忍莊，我同他們莊裏的智囊團，剛把計劃擬出了一個大綱，萍子和覺厂老人心靈交通的成績，都送了來，呌我們參攷……」（鶴見）</p>
<h3>黃山寫景</h3>
<p>— 孫福熙</p>
<p>黃山景物奇逸，凡遊覽者皆嘆觀止。許土騏先生在黃山下生長，得名山鍾靈，自幼登臨，尤受奇峯與古松之感應，故其作畫與爲人，均富有孤高超逸的精神。試觀其作品，凡山水皆有黃山之蒼古骨格，即在花卉翎毛上，亦有凜若冰霜的風度，爲一般人所不可及者。</p>
<p>抗戰時期，許先生住重慶沙坪壩柏樹邨，門前植有芭蕉數株，絲蔭滿窗畫室中陳列畫册與紙筆顏料，比數年之勤苦耕耘，誠有一日千里之勢。室　中懸西友荷蘭高羅佩書聯：</p>
<p>「靜者心多妙，飄然思不羣」。這實在是描寫他個性與寶的絕妙集句。</p>
<p>去年秋間許先生創辦黃山藝苑於上海，佈置精雅，不但較重慶沙坪壩畫室更爲宏敞。在這淸雅的賽苑中，主人時或講學援徒，尤能於心曠神怡中，靜心作畫。</p>
<p>許先生盡品的高逸讀者自能了解，今再抄錄許先生書　中，何子貞書聯，藉作結束：</p>
<p>「臨流水猶聽古樂，遇崇山若仰大賢」。</p>
<p>雖然時代不同，可是藝人的心情，襟懷的灑脫，都在這字襄行間傳達出來。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>我想起　是一位雋智的哲人說的：</p>
<p>「一個人的工作如果完成時，他的生活必定成爲他的重累。於是遂有第二工作，以消　他的生活；這意義便是减少無聊。」</p>
<p>「無聊」好像是一隻　鷹在天空飛翔，如果瞥見生活已獲得牠的需要，即預備下攫。</p>
<p>故第一工作乃是從事於有所得；第二工作則於有所得後，排遣其躊躇滿志的情感；不然，生活即成爲負累了。</p>
<p>我深深地喜歡上面的一段見解。</p>
<p>我覺得現世界之所以悲滲，即在於大部份的人們還沒有完成第一工作，甚至可以說，還沒有開始「有所得」的工作；而極少數的所謂「卒運　」己在發展他們的第二工作，在急躁躁地抓弄着自己的猴耳。</p>
<p>中國有兩句成語：</p>
<p>「天理本無事，庸人自擾之。」</p>
<p>我想，這兩句話中的「庸人」大概是指那些閒得慌的高貴人士。</p>
<p>「無聯」眞是太可怕了——牠可以墮落人性</p>
<p>如果上帝將「無聊」和「飢餓」放在我的面前，要我必須在其中取其一。沒有問題地，我顧取「飢娥」而去。</p>
<h3>大明帝國的覆亡　——讀史雜記之六</h3>
<p>— 蕭黛</p>
<p>大明帝國在永樂以前的十幾年，比較算得是安靖的。自永樂初至崇禎初的兩百年間，幾乎無一年無戰亂。馴至末年，因爲統治勢力自身腐敗的尖銳化，加以運年的飢荒，弄到「父棄其子，夫　其妻；或掘草根而自食，或掘白石以充飢」的地步。國家則因收入不敷支出，軍餉缺乏，造成了兵變。於是那些飢民叛兵，就蜂起作亂了。</p>
<p>這次變亂中，較著的爲首者爲高迎祥，稱闖王；李自成，張獻忠稱闖將。他們擁有兵力三十六營，衆二十餘萬。李自成擾黃河流域，張獻忠擾長江流域。在是盛的時期，有衆百萬；步兵四十萬人，馬兵六十萬人，到處攻城掠地，在暴動的過程中，爲求獲得民心，李自成曾下過這樣的軍令：「不得藏白金，過城邑不得室處，妻子外不得携他女人」，「有一馬攙行列者斬之，馬騰入田苗者斬之」，「所破城邑，子女玉帛惟均。」這樣的軍令，據說收到了很大的效果。到崇禎十七年三月，大明帝國的統治全部瓦解了。明史載：</p>
<p>「十八日，賊攻益急，自成駐彰義門外，遺降賊太監杜勳綰入見帝，求禪位。帝怒，叱之。下詔親征。日暝，太鹽曹化淳啓彰義門，賊盡入。帝出宮，登煤山，望烽火徹天，嘆息曰：『苦我民耳！』徘徊久之，歸乾淸宮，令送太子及永王於戚臣周奎田弘遇第，劍擊長公主，趣皇后自盡。十九日丁未，天未明，皇城不守；鳴　集百官，無至者，乃復登煤山，書衣襟爲遺詔，以帛自縊於山亭。帝遂崩。」</p>
<p>正在此時，滿族看到了明室自身的內亂，便乘機而起。起兵之先，對朝鮮訂了和議，對蒙古的征討也收了相當的效果，可以無後顧之憂了，於是以全部兵力向南方挺進。滿人的呌以要乘機攻擊漢八，「大抵不外乎明之閉關政策斷絕了滿商的生路；及官僚任意抑低物價，與稅監任意施行苛削，引起滿商仇恨」（周著中國通史）的緣故。正當滿族在步步進迫的時候，山海關總兵吳三桂的父親——吳襄——爲李自成所執，迫其致書三桂勸降。據說三桂本有降李的意思，後來聽說自己的愛妾陳沅（圓圓）爲劉宗敏所掠，遂憤而請異族壓迫同種。明史流賊列傳載：</p>
<p>「自成……聞山海關總兵吳三桂兵起，乃謀歸陝西。初，三桂奉詔入援，至山海關，京師陷，猶豫不進，自成劫其父襄作書招之，三桂欲降，至　州，聞愛姬陳沅被劉宗敏掠去，情甚，疾歸山海，襲破賊將。自成怒，親部賊十餘萬，執吳襄於軍，東攻山海關，以別將一片石越關外。三桂懼，乞降於我大淸。」</p>
<p>滿族正苦於無法進入我中國內地的時候，吳三桂僅爲了報復這點私仇，在「寧亡異族，不予家奴」的奴隸思想下，大開山海關。於是大明帝國與「家奴」們一起都完了蛋，讓滿人在中國統治了兩百多年的天下。</p>
<h3>納粹鬧笑話　—關於船名的地</h3>
<p>— 葆</p>
<p>英國海軍的習慣，每一個士官的名字，均應登記在船册上。海軍航空隊旣屬於海軍，其士官自亦須登記於船册，但是他們所在的一些陸上根據地，旣不是艦船，因此這些根據地爲了遷就法例的劃一，也就取個船名。</p>
<p>此次大戰時，英　進行廣播職，不遺餘力，爲了船名的　地，納粹廣播員却閙出了一件笑話。Kestrel號本爲英國海空軍一隨上基地之名。一九四〇年九男，納粹電台竟播稱：「英磁　司屈勒號被　國海軍轟擊，已經沉沒。」此訊遂成爲　　於盟國海軍界中的一個大笑話了。</p>
<h3>預感幷不神秘</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>現在我要說那第六感覺，並不是什麽神秘莫測的　跡。所謂硏究了十七年的敎授，是否用什麽新的學理可·倪秋萍·以絕對把指完成那預感的方法。</p>
<p>據我所知道，那預感就是所請透視或稱千星眼Telepathy，稍有一些催眠術Hypnotism常識的人，都知道那是極平凡的。不過一定要有一個催眠的受術者，施以適當的暗示Suggestion使很容易使得外行人咋，舌不置。我們可以將肉眼看不到的東西察覺。就像把任何一件東西固封起來，使受術者當塲回答，他能够立即準確地吿知我們。這是空間的奇跡，還有時間上的奇跡。</p>
<p>在佛學裏面，很有不少的材料可供硏究。但是正式學佛的信徒，是不注重那種神通的。我們不必以爲這是迷信的事。所可惜的，就是一般一知半解的人，認爲那是不科學的。說　定若干年之後，我們就可以猜　空間和時間上的啞謎了。</p>
<h3>訪梅蘭芳（三）</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>我訪梅的主意，是要看看迭物者這個特殊的傑作的本相。上帝創造人，在人類各部門都有傑作，故軍政界有英雄，學術界有豪傑。然而他們的法寳，大都全在於精神，而不在於身體。即全在於運　，指揮，苦心，孤詣的工夫上，而不在於聲音吾笑貌上。（所以常有產））只有「伶王」，其法實全在於身體的本身上。美妙的歌聲，艷麗的姿態，都由這架巧的機器。——身體——上表現出來。這不是造物者的「特殊」的傑作麼？故英雄豪傑不値得拜訪，而伶王應該拜訪，去看看卸妝後的這架巧妙的機器的本相看。</p>
<p>一個陽春的下午，在一間鬧中取靜的洋樓上，我與梅博士對坐在兩只沙發上了。照例寒暄的時候，我一時不能相信這就是舞台上的伶王。只從他的兩眼的飽滿上，可以依稀彷彿地想見虞姬，桂英的面影。我細看他的面孔，覺得骨子的確生得很好。又看他的身體，修短肥瘠，也恰到好處。西洋的標準人體是希臘的凡奴司（Venus），在中國也有她的石膏模型流行。我想：依人體美的標準測騐起來，梅郎的身材容貌大槪近於凡奴司，是具有東洋標準人體的資格的。他很高興和我說話，他的本音宏亮而帶黏潤。由此也可依稀彷彿地想見「雲歛晴空，水倫乍湧」和「孩兒捨不得爹爹」的音調。</p>
<p>從他的很高興說話的口裏，我知道他在淪陷期中如何苦心地逃避，如何從香港脫險。據說，全靠犯香港的敵兵中，有一個軍官，自言幼時曾由其母親帶去看梅氏在東京的演戲，對他有好感，因此幸得脫險。又知道他的担負很重，許多梨園子弟都要他瞻養，生活並不富裕。這時候他的房東正在對他下逐客令，須得幾根金條方可續租。他慨然地對我說，「我唱戲掙來的錢，那里有幾根金條呢！」我很驚訝，為甚麼他的話使我特別感動。仔細硏究，原來他愛用兩手的姿勢來帮助說話；而這姿勢非常自然，是普通人所做不出的！</p>
<h3>臥榻之旁</h3>
<p>— 葉林</p>
<p>前人有方警愓：「臥楊之旁，豈容他人酣睡。」</p>
<p>酣睡亦所不容，更何况人家淸醒着而妄圖有所作爲了。我們在臥榻之上又豈能高枕無憂呢？</p>
<p>觀近日報載，日本政府致函麥帥提出對和約觀點，要求在台灣有移民特許權，要求琉球民政權並與美國共　，實在令人髮指，五日本報又載，日船大神丸侵入我國領海活動，在圍頭澳爲我海關緝獲，這也不是尋常的事件，至於觀麥帥之支持日本海外貿易和輕工業，及日本漁船之在我國沿海捕魚，及近來日貨之標用美國製造名義侵入我國，這一連串的事例，使我們更感到一份壓力，軍國主義的日本是在我們臥榻之旁由濟伏而積極的活動了，這是値得我們警惕一下的。</p>
<p>歷史上大槪是沒有一個投降了的國家向戰勝國去要求共管與移民的特權的，如果說有，那得首推日本了。在這裏。我們看到了日本是那樣野心勃勃的企圖保有其南太平洋的「跳板」。在這裏，我們也可以看到百年來歷史的影子了。</p>
<p>以史爲鑑，我們多麽需要時時刻刻警愓於臥榻之旁—</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>好容易在五分鐘以內，把這孩子救醒了。但這時候那四輛卡車的引擎，已像虎吼一樣的開始在發動了。他低頭瞧瞧緋緋，雖然已經哭出來了，但眼晴還沒有睜開，神智也依然很昏亂，使他不敢就離開她；又過了一兩分鐘，慮前跛着一腿，氣息僅屬地奔過來，把一杯徽溫的開水授給老祝，讓他緩緩地給緋緋灌下去，不覺又是三四分鐘過去了。</p>
<p>「媽！我要媽……！」緋緋這才睜開眼請。大聲地喊。</p>
<p>「好，祝伯伯抱你去！」老祝像搶一樣的把她從地上抱起來，立刻望已開始在轉動的那四綱上車衝去。</p>
<p>闌和張昌搭的那一輛車排在第二，待到祝兆年抱着緋緋衝出人叢，第三輛車已在他們面前滾過去了，衷心抱着一種極不祥的遺憾的老祝不顧了命的沿着公路拔步緊追，他的急促的氣喘聲和緋緋顫抖的哭聲，合成了一種盪人心肺的刺耳的節奏。</p>
<p>最後，雖然勉强給他追出了第三輛車，可以望見第二輛車的尾部了，但蘭是半躺在行李堆上的，位置特別低，全身恰好都給卡車後面的一塊橫板擋住了；累得已很乏力的老祝要想一路跑，一路把緋緋高舉起來，讓她再看一看她媽，實在是力不從心了。他感到這樣追下去是無益的，脚下漸漸緩了下來。</p>
<p>車上站着的張昌忽然發現了他們，忙用手亂揮。</p>
<p>「緋緋！」老祝終於氣喘不止地站定了，同時還得裝着笑，低下頭去，向哭個不歇的緋緋解說：「追不上了！反正我們明兒也要走的，一到河池，就可以看見你媽了。」</p>
<p>而緋緋却閉上了眼儘哭。</p>
<p>第三第四輛車都很快地掠過他們開上去了，黃沙滾滾，一隻眼已在公路的拐角上先後消失了影子，祇　隱約地還可以聽到隨風吹來的一陣陣間歇的口琴聲。</p>
<p>祝兆年緩緩地垂下頭去，瞧着哭得滿臉淚痕的緋緋，嘿然無語，心頭兜起無　的悵惘。</p>

<h3>Tightening Currency and Relaxing Controls: New Economic Plan Under Review; Property Tax Collection Also Under Careful Study</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Premier Zhang recently stated in a written response to inquiries from senators, "The Executive Yuan has drafted a plan for the entire economic reform issue and is submitting it to the National Government for review." According to an authoritative source, while the economic reform plan has been drafted, certain details still need to be studied. Before the plan is implemented, the current economic and financial policies will continue to follow the following two principles: (1) Tightening the currency supply, including reducing the amount of currency issued and contracting the amount of loans; (2) Relaxing controls to gradually reduce the controls on production and all other industries.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The authorities are thoroughly reviewing the emergency economic measures, with particular emphasis on balancing the budget. Regarding the expenditure side, the plan stipulates reducing all unnecessary expenditures, but there are many aspects worth considering in terms of implementation. For example, the state's expenses for grain collection agencies are estimated at 760 billion, but the income is very small, and the cost is not much cheaper than purchasing in the market. Therefore, some people advocate returning 30% to local governments and allowing them to collect it themselves, which could save at least several hundred billion. In terms of administrative expenses, the expenses of some local tax authorities are higher than the amount of tax revenue collected. To reduce financial administrative costs, some people advocate restoring the past contract system. Regarding military spending, the number of troops seems excessive. Some experts suggest reducing the number of rear-area troops and assigning soldiers to actual work as much as possible. Regarding increasing revenue, a one-time property tax will be levied. In addition, the government may introduce a kind of "disguised subsidy policy" in exchange for foreign exchange.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The five groups under the National Economic Commission held meetings this week to thoroughly review the issue of balancing the budget. They have now completed the review and are preparing a report to be submitted to the National Economic Commission on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The authorities are carefully studying the issue of levying a one-time property tax, and its implementation is only a matter of time. It is reported that at the meeting of the National Economic Commission, some committee members argued that the national economy is on the brink of such a critical juncture, and the wealthy families cannot be allowed to continue to be unfettered. In order to give the people of the country a fresh start, at least a "symbolic levy" should be made. Some people suggested simply listing the names of 100 wealthy families and levying a 50% one-time property tax as an example for the world.</p>
<h3>Gold Returns to Shanghai from the US and Discusses the Current Situation in China; The CCP's Delaying Tactics Aim to Further Deteriorate the Economy</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Gold, the chief editor of the Shanghai-based "China Press," returned to Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday and gave detailed answers to various questions raised by reporters. Mr. Gold believes that although Marshall's mediation has failed, the essence of the United States' policy towards China has not changed. However, this setback has made Americans realize the difficulty of dealing with the China issue. Therefore, in terms of attitude, it used to be biased towards emotion, but now it focuses on reality. The goal, however, remains unchanged and will be pursued with even greater effort. US loans to China are commercial loans, not political loans. When making loans, it is necessary to consider whether they can be repaid. Therefore, in the special telegram he sent, he believed that only if China achieves internal peace can the loans be successfully implemented. However, this is a general inference and does not specifically refer to any particular loan. In terms of the situation in China, the Communist Party is currently implementing a delaying tactic, hoping that the domestic economic situation will further deteriorate, thereby strengthening the CCP's position. However, the result of this policy is that the entire country of China suffers. When the reporter told him that some people believe that if US-Soviet relations improve, the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be easier to resolve, Mr. Gold replied, "Everyone has their own views. Personally, I believe that the United States has no intention of supporting the Kuomintang in order to gain control in China, and the Soviet Union will not openly support the CCP." Regarding the Truman Doctrine, Mr. Gold believes that this is the recognition and proposition of the American people in general. It is inappropriate to associate this policy with President Truman's name, because an individual's political fate is uncertain. In both world wars, the United States was drawn into the vortex against its own wishes. Therefore, it is generally believed that the United States should be more involved in world affairs and provide more assistance to those in need. Today, the world is becoming smaller and smaller, so the international thinking of the American people is also rising. As for whether this policy will stimulate the Soviet Union, it depends on the Soviet Union's thinking. If it does not engage in Third International activities and promote communism in the world, there is no reason to be dissatisfied with the United States' policy. The reporter told him that the people and the government of our country attach great importance to the reconstruction of Japan, believing that it will one day threaten China and the world. Mr. Gold believes that there is no need to overemphasize this, because Japan's current predicament is beyond people's imagination and cannot be restored in the short term. The United States will also strictly implement its control over Japan for a long time. However, the Japanese people are working hard to improve their environment in light of the current situation. He believes that Japan's reconstruction is enough to warn China, but it will not pose a threat in a considerable period of time.</p>
<h3>Manchester Guardian Comments on the CCP's Misdeeds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 6th] The Manchester Guardian published an article by its correspondent in China, stating that we should not ignore the misdeeds of the Communist Party system because of our dissatisfaction with the Kuomintang. Regarding the CCP's misdeeds, the correspondent stated: There are many reports about the CCP's atrocities in the Communist-controlled areas, and the sources are different, so there must be some truth in them. Every time the Communist Party coerces any area, the people of that area flee to the government-controlled area, and no one has ever heard of people from the government-controlled area going to the Communist-controlled area. The article also discussed the possibility of British trade with China, saying that the opportunity for British trade with China is very small at present. However, a well-known Shanghai businessman once said that British companies in China must maintain their confidence, and the opportunity will change, and the opportunity for British businessmen will still come. The article concluded by saying that China currently has a genuine friendship with Britain, believing that Britain has no ambitions towards China, and Britain's declaration of independence for India has made a deep impression on China and has made Britain no longer regarded as an imperialist country.</p>
<h3>US Embassy Counselor and Others Transfer from Shenyang to Beiping</h3>

Mr. Jones, the former US Consul in Shenyang, also left Shenyang at the same time.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 7th] There are many rumors in Shenyang recently, but it is peaceful. Wealthy people continue to flee to Beiping and Tianjin.

He gave encouragement to the students during the banquet. Also, Bai Chongxi hosted a banquet for Guo Zongfen, the Chief of Staff of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, Chen Yisong, Yang Zhong and other Taiwan senators at 12:30 noon on the 7th, and received Wu Shipeng, Li Peide, Zhang Yishan, Liu Jie and other Shanxi senators at 4:30 pm.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to Xu Chuanlin, for the convenience of work, he plans to stay in Beijing for a long time after taking office as a government committee member. The Social Democratic Party attaches great importance to the unified interpretation of the constitution, and Zhang Junmai will go to Beijing for this purpose in the coming days. Xu also said that Hong Shaozhi, a member of the Organization Committee, has received a telegram from the Democratic Constitutional Government Party in the Americas, stating that it will remain neutral on the party's internal disputes. Wu Xianzai told Xu yesterday that he does not intend to take the post of government committee member and will return to Hong Kong soon.</p>
<h3>Zuo Shunsheng Arrives in Shanghai to Meet Huo Baoshu</h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of the Use of Agricultural Machinery</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 7 am yesterday.

<h3>Chiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party Writes to Secretary-General Wu</h3>
<p>Inquiring About the Arrest of Members of the Social Democratic Party</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Chiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party wrote to Wu Tiecheng and Lei Zhen on the 7th, inquiring about the arrest of Li Yunzhang of the party in Xuanhua on the 7th.</p>
<h3>The Periphery of Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang is Peaceful; The Main Force of the Communist Army in Shandong Retreats to the Second Line; Tense Warfare in Northern Henan is Imminent</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 7th] The periphery of Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang has been peaceful for the past week. In Jinan, only the independent regiment of the Communist Army is stationed in Xijiao [?], the first military sub-district with a thousand people is stationed in Wenzu [?], and the central Shandong military district with two thousand people is stationed at Tusikou and Chayekou. On the north bank of the Yellow River, on the Taozhang side, more than 10,000 remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops who had fled back from northern Henan arrived the other day and are resting and reorganizing. On the Yimeng Mountain area, the Yiju front line, there have only been small battles in the past week.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 7th] It is reported that the main force of the Shandong Communist Army has temporarily withdrawn from the Yu [?] front and is actively reorganizing and preparing to move again on the second line. As for when and where the next major war will break out, there are no obvious signs to be found at present. The current distribution of the ten columns of the Shandong Communist Army is: the First Column is stationed in Donglidian, the Seventh Column is stationed in Dazhangzhuang (both between Boshan and Yishui), the Second and Sixth Columns are stationed in Boshan, the Third and Fourth Columns are stationed in Linshui, Yidu and Mazhan, Jiangyu, the Fifth Column is stationed north of Zhucheng to the Jiaoji Railway, the current Eighth Column is stationed in Jitai, the Tenth Column is stationed in Zhangqiu, Qidong, and the Ninth Column is stationed in Dazeshan, southeast of Laiyang. The main reason for the Shandong Communist Party to adopt this deployment is that all the wells in the area near the Yimeng Mountain battlefield were blocked with hot rocks during the major battle in the middle of last month. In addition, due to the lack of food, in order to facilitate the supply and receive new recruits, they have grabbed the newly commissioned village as military rations. Therefore, there is this new arrangement. It is absolutely not true that a part of the main force of the Communist Army has crossed the river, attempting to attack Beiping and Tianjin. In fact, as of the 7th, only a small number of troops crossed the river to Huimin and Lijin to receive new recruits. Currently, the Jiang Communist Education Brigade Special 12th Regiment is stationed in Huimin, and a new recruit division is stationed in Lijin.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 7th] After the sporadic Communist troops lurking in the triangular area of Changqing, Feicheng, and Pingyin were actively mopped up by the Nationalist army in the past week, they were all wiped out by the 6th. The remnants of the Cui Ziming and Zhang Yaonan troops of the Jilu-Yu military region of the Communist army, with 2,000 each, have fled to the area between Feicheng and Dongping. The Nationalist army is continuing to pursue them.</p>
<p>[Our Xinpu Office, 7th] Xiangshuikou, a major town in Guanyun County, was captured by the Communist army at 1 am last night. Many people in the city were massacred by the Communist army. The Nationalist army in Haizhou rushed to reinforce and counterattack, and the fighting was quite fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th] The Nationalist army advancing northward in northern Henan and Liu Bocheng's main force of the Communist army have both been maneuvering in a vast area recently, and war is imminent. At the moment, a part of Liu Bocheng's main force has indeed crossed the Wei River, but a part is still in the Wulingji and Tunziji areas southeast of Tangyin. Qi County has now become a military vacuum area, because it is not very important in the current strategic situation of both sides. The Nationalist army in Anyang has completely recovered the villages within 15 li to the southeast and 20 li to the north and south. The Communist army is everywhere exposing vulnerabilities, and the situation in Anyang has in fact disappeared.</p>
<h3>Drafting Committee for the Constitution Explanatory Book Meets Once Every Two Weeks; Organizational Regulations Promulgated by the National Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The National Government ordered that the Organizational Regulations for the Drafting Committee for the Constitution Explanatory Book be promulgated. This order.</p>

<p>Article 7 These regulations shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Political Consultative Conference's Call for Peace, the CCP Responds Informally, Denying the Conference's Qualifications and Rejecting Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Although the plan to reopen peace talks with the CCP has been proposed by the Political Consultative Conference, its realization is extremely difficult. According to a broadcast by the CCP's Xinhua News Agency radio station on the evening of the 5th, they have made an informal response to the peace call made by the Political Consultative Conference. The CCP has denied the qualifications of the Political Consultative Conference, claiming that the Political Consultative Conference is a Political Consultative Conference used by the Kuomintang. The conference has proposed stopping grain collection and conscription, and issued a call for peace. At the same time, it has made various resolutions that are conducive to war, which is a loss of the true meaning of peace. When the reporter asked government officials about this issue on the 7th, it was said that the CCP's statement was another rejection of peace talks and the closing of the door to peace. There are many reefs in the future of peace, and the government's unilateral proposal of peace cannot achieve results.</p>
<h3>US Tea Expert Hutchinson Discusses China's Tea Improvement Plan, Emphasizing More Advertising to Compete with Indian Tea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] US tea expert Hutchinson met with a Central News Agency reporter alone to comment on the Chinese government's three-year plan to improve the tea industry. He said that the plan is good, but its implementation may be difficult. Since the end of the war, the quality of Chinese tea has been poor, and the Indian and Ceylon tea industries have done a lot of advertising, while China has done nothing in this regard. As a result, the average American knows Indian and Ceylon tea better than Chinese tea. According to Hutchinson, the number of buyers of Chinese tea has decreased sharply due to its poor quality. When the reporter asked whether the three-year plan is enough to make Chinese tea regain the American market, Hutchinson believed that more advertising may increase sales in the United States, but since most Americans prefer Indian and Ceylon tea, Chinese tea can at most follow suit and cannot become a major [?] American country. Hutchinson admitted that according to the plan, China [?] is easy to develop into a good tea exporting country. At the same time, Hutchinson [?] showed: due to poor quality, the number of [?] tea that was returned is countless [?]. From January to May this year, the number of [?] pounds of Chinese tea exported to the United States was 100,670 [?], of which 45,000 pounds were returned. Of the 119,157 pounds of Wucha, 53,990 pounds were returned. Of the 80,480 pounds of Guangzhou Bird with Lotus [?], there were also 1,690 [?] pounds [?] pounds were returned. On the other hand, 1,215 pounds of Longjing tea, 12,418 pounds of Xiang [?] tea, 53,430 pounds of Qimen tea, 928 pounds of Litchi School tea (translated from the past), and 27,016 pounds of Luoshan tea (translated), all were purchased without any returns. Hutchinson said that Chinese tea exporters have many difficulties in packaging. He believes that the reason is that China lacks wood. Experiments have been done here, and wooden boxes have been quite successful. He hopes that exporters will use wooden boxes, because the cost is lower, the weight is lighter, and it is easier to transport.</p>
<p>American Tea Merchants to Meet This Fall to Discuss High Price Problems</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Bain, chairman of the American Tea Association, told a Central News Agency reporter that the future of Chinese tea is still not bright, because the current tea market is very chaotic, and Chinese tea has been declining for the past twenty years. The quality of Chinese [?] tea exported after the war is also poor. Bain pointed out that the United States consumes 60 million pounds of tea every year, of which 80% [?] is produced in India and [?] Sri Lanka. The tea produced in China and Taiwan accounts for only 20% of the tea consumed in the United States every year. Another noteworthy fact is that the sales of Chinese tea in other parts of the world (excluding North Africa and the Soviet Union) are also not good. Therefore, he does not know how the Chinese government can expect to export such a quantity of tea this year, because there is no large-scale market for Chinese tea to sell immediately. When the reporter asked why large chain grocery stores in the United States only sell Indian and Ceylon tea and no Chinese tea, Bain replied that this is because Indian and Ceylon tea is cultivated in a scientific way for a long time, so the quality is excellent. He also said that American tea merchants will hold a national conference this fall to discuss the high price problems encountered by American tea after the war. The conference will put forward many suggestions [?] and will definitely involve the future policy of American tea and the three-year plan for the revival of the Chinese tea industry. The American Tea Association has a total of 110 members, including packaging companies, distributors, importers, and guarantors [?], and the largest chain [?] grocery stores.</p>
<h3>The Food Panic Has Passed; Foreign Rice is Being Shipped to China, and Sichuan Province Has Also Had a Bumper Harvest; Food Administration Authorities Say Rice Prices Have Generally Fallen</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Food administration authorities told reporters on the 7th in a [?] optimistic tone that the food panic is almost over. Rice prices have generally fallen in various places, and will continue to fall in the short term. It is said that the following points at least can be optimistic: (1) A large number of foreign rice is coming to China. In addition to the 300,000 [?] tons of foreign rice purchased with US relief funds, the 200,000 tons allocated to China by the International Food Conference are also being rushed to China by the China Trust Bureau. From this month onwards, at least 70,000 to 80,000 tons can be shipped every month. In addition, the China Trust Bureau has purchased and shipped 200,000 tons of wheat and flour. (2) Sichuan Province has had a bumper harvest this year, and the number of rice boats leaving Sichuan is increasing every day. Recently, a boat carrying more than 100 tons has arrived, and a large amount will continue to arrive in the future. (3) Anhui and other provinces have lifted the ban, and a large amount of Anhui rice can be shipped to Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. (4) New wheat has been harvested. All of these will be of great help in regulating food for the people.</p>
<h3>Reviewing the Economy of Chahar and Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhentang's Pacification Headquarters Holds a Peak Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Office, 7th] The Zhang Zhen Tang Pacification Headquarters held a discussion meeting on economic construction in Chahar and Suiyuan at 1 pm on the 7th, which was presided over by Fu Zuoyi. Wu Qiwu and other relevant personnel participated. In addition to broadly exchanging views on the implementation of the resolutions of the previous discussion meeting, the meeting reviewed the current economic situation of Chahar and Suiyuan. Chief Fu advocated using revolutionary means to save the economic crisis and put forward the four slogans of "save, produce, organize, and fight." The [?] meeting closed that evening.</p>
<h3>Luo Zhuoying and Wang Dongyuan Given Reprimands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In the resolution announced by the Political Affairs Disciplinary Committee on the 7th, Wang Dongyuan, the former chairman of Hubei Province, were given reprimands. According to the resolution, Luo was impeached by Zhang Kefu, Li Zhengle and other supervisory committee members because provincial civil servants in Guangdong Province had gathered to destroy the Guangdong Audit Office of the Auditing Department. Wang was impeached by Miao Peicheng, the supervisory commissioner, for illegally spending interest on deposit money during his tenure as chairman of Hubei Province.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications is Working to Increase Freight Transportation on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] A senior official of the Railways told a United Press reporter that the Ministry of Communications is eager to increase freight transportation on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. The measures are: converting the entire line into a double-track line, converting some sections into variable tracks, establishing a central transportation control system, and improving the automatic signal system.</p>
<p>However, the cost of converting to a double-track line is too high, so the last two measures are most likely to be adopted. Insufficient funds are the most important difficulty, and if the Five [?] Tianjin loan is successful, it is hoped that a part of it can be allocated to the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>He also said that the negotiations on the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing railway with French investment have not made any progress so far.</p>
<h3>Authorities Consider Merging Two Disciplinary Committees</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The two organizations, the Political Officials Disciplinary Committee and the Central Civil Servants Disciplinary Committee, were originally separated, which caused many constraints on the handling of cases. The authorities are considering merging these two organizations. In addition, the post of Chairman of the Central Civil Servants Disciplinary Committee will be concurrently held by Li Wenfan, the newly appointed Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, and Li will be sworn in soon.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang of Shandong Province Sends a Curse [?] to Comfort the Recovered Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Wan [?] Office, 7th] Wang Yaowu, Chairman of Shandong Province, specially appointed Qin Yiwen, the director of the Provincial Taiwan Management Office and the head of the Shandong Area Team of the Sui District Refugee Relief, to inspect the newly recovered counties in southwestern Shandong and to [?] comfort the local areas. Mr. Qin left for Xu [?] by plane at 8 am on the 7th and transferred to Yan.</p>
<h3>The Repair and Recovery of Anyang Airport is in Good Condition</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Linzhou, 7th] The Communist army outside Anyang was repelled more than ten miles again on the 6th. The airport has been repaired and completed. The test landing on the 6th was in good condition. From then on, there will be no more worries about food shortages in Anyang.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Doctor in the Communist Area Defects to the Nationalist Army</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Gao [?] Minlang, a Japanese national in the Health Department of the Jicha Military Region of the Chinese Communist Party, defected to the Nationalist Army on the front line of Guangling on the 21st of last month and has now arrived in Zhangjiakou. He is from Osaka, 28 years old, and a doctor. After Japan surrendered, he was forced to serve the Chinese Communist Party. He defected because he could not bear the difficult life in the Communist area. It is said that there are still more than 300 Japanese technicians in Fuping.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Eastern Gansu Surrenders</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 7th] Li Zhanshan, the leader of the Communist guerrillas in eastern Gansu, led his unit of 17 people to surrender to the Nationalist Army with rifles on the 5th, on the grounds that the Communist Party was betraying the country and harming the people.</p>
<h3>Remnant Communist Troops in the Changcheng Coal Mine Area Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] A spokesman for the Beiping Pacification Headquarters answered reporters' questions on the 7th, saying: (1) The area on both sides of the Guan Nei section of the Beiping-Ningxia line is being mopped up. The remnant Communist troops in the Changcheng Coal Mine and Beidaihe area have now been eliminated. As for Qian'an and Funing in Hebei, they can be recovered immediately when they need to be recovered strategically.

The headquarters has submitted a request to the headquarters for the implementation of martial law. This is based on the provisions of the Martial Law Act for censorship of news.

<h3>Japan's Territorial Ambitions Revive, British and Philippine Public Opinion Resentful, Hong Kong Chinese Newspapers Criticize Severely</h3>
<p>[Reuters London Dispatch on the 6th] The revival of Japan's territorial ambitions has aroused resentment in British public opinion. Recent newspaper reports that Japanese Foreign Ministry officials admitted to having ambitions to "recover" Taiwan are particularly unrealistic, as the Cairo Declaration specifically stipulated that the island should be returned to China. Meanwhile, a British Foreign Office spokesman stated tonight that Britain considers the transfer of the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union a fait accompli and does not need to wait for the ratification of the Far East Peace Treaty. Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida recently stated at a press conference in Tokyo that Japan would demand the return of at least some of the Kuril Islands and revise the land provisions for Japan announced by the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference in 1945. Foreign observers say that although Britain will regard the provisions of the Yalta Secret Agreement regarding the transfer of the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union as a definite decision, Japan may argue that the land declarations issued by the Allied leaders during the war were not clear in meaning. The Potsdam Declaration stated that the conditions of the Cairo Declaration of 1943 would be implemented, and that Japan's sovereignty after the war would only extend to the four main islands of the mainland and some small islands to be determined by the Allies. If this provision is combined with the Yalta Secret Agreement, then the Kuril Islands cannot continue to be retained by Japan. However, the Japanese may argue that the Cairo Declaration limits the content of the Potsdam Agreement; the Cairo Declaration stipulates that Japan must return the land it had seized since 1914, any land seized from China, and any land seized by force, and the Kuril Islands do not fall into any of the aforementioned categories, as Japan obtained the Kuril Islands from Russia in exchange for the southern part of Sakhalin Island under the Treaty of St. Petersburg in 1875. Although Japan recovered the southern part of Sakhalin Island after the Russo-Japanese War, it continued to occupy the Kuril Islands. Britain's response to this Japanese argument would be that the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement should prevail in the event of a conflict with the provisions of the Cairo Agreement, and the Yalta Agreement has absolute binding force.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Manila Dispatch on the 7th] There is considerable dissatisfaction here with the statement of Japan's new Foreign Minister Ashida. Ashida stated that Japan hopes to retain the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, when concluding a peace treaty with the Allies. An editorial in today's Manila Bulletin stated that Ashida's focus on "additional territory" seems "better than restoring trade." Ashida hopes to recover the Ryukyu Islands and the Kuril Islands, and establish a police force equipped with Lee-Enfield rifles and machine guns. Ashida mentioned with great care that Japan would not demand the restoration of its army and navy, but in fact, it contained the implication that "such a request may be made in the future."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Hong Kong Dispatch on the 7th] Japan's desire to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States, as well as its desire to enjoy special immigration rights to Taiwan, has today aroused severe criticism from Chinese newspapers here. An editorial in the Huaqiao Daily stated that the Ryukyu Islands have belonged to China since ancient times, and the Cairo and Potsdam Agreements stipulated that Taiwan and other lost territories should be returned to China after the war. The newspaper stated that the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan are permanently maintained as part of Chinese territory, which is not only important for protecting China's long coastline but also for maintaining peace in the Far East. The Guomin Daily, in exposing Japan's dual personality, stated that aggression against Chinese territory must be stopped by all means. The newspaper also warned that the strategic value of the Ryukyu Islands in the hands of Japan may lead to further aggression against China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The newspaper also reminded the world that Japan used Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands as a base for southward expansion in the past, leading to World War II.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Senators and National Assembly Representatives Resolve to Telegraph Chairman Jiang to Properly Plan Countermeasures to Defeat Japanese Conspiracy, Taiwanese Compatriots Unanimously Indignant Towards Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch on the 7th] Taiwan Provincial Senators and National Assembly representatives held a joint meeting this morning to discuss the issue of Japan's attempt to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands and obtain special immigration rights to Taiwan. They resolved to telegraph Chairman Chiang to properly plan countermeasures to defeat the Japanese conspiracy. Furthermore, the Taiwan Provincial Senate is scheduled to convene its first session of the third congress on the 20th. The Taipei City Council closed this afternoon, passing a resolution endorsing Chairman Wei's social stability policy and resolving to organize an inland inspection tour, with city councilors signing up to participate. The number of members and the travel schedule have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch on the 7th] The Taiwanese compatriots who have been ravaged by Japanese imperialism for more than half a century are deeply indignant at today's defeated Japan, which openly expresses unreasonable demands to the victorious nations, attempting to obtain its immigration privileges to Taiwan. At the moment, this bizarre and absurd news has become a common topic of conversation among Taiwanese compatriots. Some people believe that the most effective measure to head off Japan's attempt to meddle in Taiwan again is to immediately send all seven hundred and thirteen Japanese expatriates currently remaining in Taiwan back to Japan. This argument is not new. Last year, the most vocal proponents of large-scale repatriation of Japanese expatriates were the Taiwanese compatriots who were oppressed by the Japanese, not the officials of the former Taiwan Provincial Government. After the retrocession of Taiwan, according to statistics from the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan under Japanese rule, there were a total of 323,259 Japanese expatriates in Taiwan. Before January 35, the Taiwan Provincial Government's review resulted in a confirmed number of 322,149 Japanese expatriates, and another 183,079 Japanese troops stationed in Taiwan. After our country's three repatriations, except for the Japanese troops who were all repatriated first, there are currently 713 Japanese expatriates remaining in Taiwan, including 260 technical personnel retained for employment and 453 family members.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Compatriots in Shanghai Send Telegram Demanding Stern Protest</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Representatives of the Taiwan Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, representing Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai, requested the government authorities to take effective measures to prevent the ambitions of Japanese imperialism. They sent a special telegram to the Chairman of the National Government and the President of the Executive Yuan, as well as the Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government, stating: "Japan hopes to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States, obtain fishing rights near the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island, and obtain immigration rights in Taiwan." This record is likely not groundless. If it is indeed a fact, then our six million Taiwanese compatriots will once again fall into slavery, and national sovereignty will be infringed upon. The shame may be even worse than the cession of Taiwan in 1895. For the present plan, we earnestly hope that our government will quickly investigate the truth. If there is such a thing, a serious protest should be lodged immediately, and a peace conference should be convened to firmly maintain the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, listing its territorial authority as an important agenda item, so as to prevent its immigration pretext, and ensure that the aggressor does not repeat its cunning tricks. This will not only preserve the enthusiasm of all Taiwanese people who have endured humiliation and sought glory for the motherland for fifty years but will also be the unanimous sympathy of the entire Republic of China. The members of this association witnessed the increasingly dangerous situation with great concern and sent an urgent telegram to your government to take effective measures to maintain international prestige and comfort the people's hope. Taiwan Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, Chairman Li Weiguang, and all members."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch on the 7th] Authoritative sources said today: The US Joint Chiefs of Staff instructed MacArthur for the Far East Commission that not only Japanese and enemy industrial in Japan were used as reparations, but factories of neutral countries in the country were used as reparations. Since the announcement of reparations, this is the first time MacArthur has received clear orders from the Far East Commission on the issue of reparations. The order of the Joint Chiefs of Staff lists Japanese military industries and supporting military industries as the first industries to be dismantled, and "financial" industries are also listed in the priority reparations list. After the above-mentioned industries are removed, the Allied Headquarters is authorized to use the industries established by the enemy in Japan as reparations. The order also instructs MacArthur to choose the most complete factories for reparations, so as to avoid requesting countries to obtain dilapidated or even unusable factories. An authoritative person said that the new order of the Far East Commission will not greatly interfere with MacArthur's efforts to resolve the reparations issue since Japan's surrender. They pointed out that MacArthur's compensation plan has so far been generally operated in accordance with the new instructions of the Far East Commission.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Social Security Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various circles in Shanghai organized the "Social Security Promotion Association" and held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, proclaiming the slogan "Uphold justice, support good people." This slogan is resonant, and this movement is active. We must pay attention to this major social event.</p>
<p>Social security is a common demand of people in various countries during and after the war, and it is also a policy that every progressive government strives to achieve. In China, especially in Shanghai, the center of economy and culture, social security is a call that every citizen wants to make. However, how this urgent call can be translated into reality is still worthy of our deep discussion. Many elders and virtuous people have already made this grand wish, and we sincerely hope that they can persevere so that this great and meaningful social security movement can unfold vigorously.</p>
<p>To achieve social security, we must first understand the reasons why society today feels insecure. The war continues, peace talks are hopeless, discipline is swept away, and credibility is lost: these are political factors of insecurity. Prices are high, people's livelihood is difficult, rural areas are bankrupt, and industry is in danger: these are economic factors of insecurity. Public morale is declining, morality is abandoned, the virtuous are hidden, and violence is rampant: these are social factors of insecurity. Loss of self-confidence, dependence, misunderstanding of freedom, and misinterpretation of democracy: these are cultural factors of insecurity. Psychological abnormality, social deformity, suspicion as a norm, and struggle as a task: these are psychological factors of insecurity. These various factors accumulate, interact, and intertwine to form the complex and comprehensive result of social insecurity. If we truly want to promote social security, and further ensure social security, we must pool our wisdom and efforts, act promptly, and simultaneously address all aspects to thoroughly eradicate these many root causes of the disease.</p>
<p>Today, to save society and save the country, no matter how many words are spoken, we must first ask everyone to bring forth their conscience! This is what Mencius called the extension of innate knowledge, and also what Mr. Yangming called the unity of knowledge and action. And today's greatest problem for the country lies in the fact that self-respecting people (that is, so-called good people) mostly only know how to passively protect themselves and are unwilling to stand up, unite, and take on the important task of supporting the tottering and rescuing the endangered. This may be due to the fact that the authorities have not sincerely sought talent, only knowing to look within a few parties, not knowing to sincerely search in the wider society, and mostly because the government has no rewards or punishments, and society has no right or wrong, so righteousness declines and the overall situation deteriorates. In fact, there is no time without talent, and no place without the virtuous. As the saying goes, "Within a hundred steps, there must be fragrant grass, and within a town of ten households, there must be loyalty and trustworthiness." We only need to encourage people with courage and righteousness in every place to join hands and unite to reverse the declining trend, and society can be stabilized, and politics will gradually become clear. This is the same principle as what Mr. Disheng said: "The origin of customs is thin, depending on the direction of one or two people's hearts." Today, we can say that we have reached the crossroads of social decline and social stability, the boundary between national peril and national revival. The degree of severity and danger does not allow us to take it lightly! If social leaders stubbornly cling to their old ways, or only know how to be depressed and sigh, or even become angry and reckless, and do not take a proactive attitude to solve the people's suffering and purify the political atmosphere from political, economic, social, cultural, and psychological aspects, then the country's future may be unimaginable. This is why we attach importance to the social security movement launched in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to offer a word to the government authorities: The shocking waves of June 2nd have indeed passed, but the authorities must not think that they can rest easy, especially not mistakenly believe that when a crisis comes, a declaration of martial law can be handled easily and adequately. It must be understood that the formation of a flood must have its inherent causes; if after the torrent has passed, one does not know how to dredge and cure the root cause, and encounters a dangerous situation again in the blink of an eye, it will inevitably be more turbulent than before, and if the effectiveness of the dyke is lost, the situation will inevitably collapse and overflow without stopping! Therefore, the overall situation today is by no means a time for the authorities to congratulate themselves and announce stability, but rather a time for officials and people to cooperate, concentrate their efforts, open their hearts, spread justice, clarify right and wrong, and distinguish between good and evil, in order to soothe the people's grievances and cure the cancer of inequality between the rich and the poor. Then, not only can social security be guaranteed, but the entire country can also easily reverse the chaos and return to the right path, and truly see prosperity. We sincerely hope that the social security movement in Shanghai can influence the whole country, so that the government can understand the true trend of popular will and decide on a policy of how to start anew with the people!</p>

<h3>Soviet Interference in Hungarian Internal Affairs, US to Lodge Strong Protest, Accuses Soviets of Violating Agreements and Investigation is Necessary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] It was officially announced here today that the State Department has drafted a strongly worded protest to be lodged with the Soviet commander in Hungary, stating that Soviet actions in Hungary constitute illegal interference in Hungarian internal affairs and suggesting that the three powers investigate the situation in Hungary. It further implied that if a satisfactory response is not received, the United States will take action. The note has not yet been presented to the Hungarian government, and it is hoped that more information can be obtained from Hungary before it is sent. President Truman is understood to have fully agreed to the contents of the draft note. It is understood that the note will state that the US State Department believes that the Soviet commander in Hungary is directly related to the events that led to the resignation of former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, and therefore constitutes a direct act of interference in Hungarian internal affairs. The note will also accuse Soviet officials of violating the Yalta Agreement, in which the three powers jointly stated that they would coordinate the policies of the three powers' governments during the temporary period after the liberation of Europe before it became stable, to assist the European people in solving their urgent political and economic problems by democratic means. The State Department's note will also suggest the establishment of a three-power fact-finding mission to investigate the entire political situation in Hungary. The note concludes by stating that if a satisfactory response is not received on all the requested points, the United States will consider filing a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly or Security Council. It is also reported that Brigadier General Weems, the US representative on the Allied Control Commission in Hungary, asked the Soviet commander earlier this week to provide information on the resignation of Nagy. It is not yet known whether the Soviet commander has replied. It is expected that the State Department will wait for the Soviet commander to respond to the previous request before submitting its protest note.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] It has been learned that the British Foreign Office has received a copy of the protest note that the United States intends to present to the Allied Control Commission in Hungary. Well-informed sources believe that the United Kingdom will likely support the US proposal to establish a British, American, and Soviet commission to investigate the situation in Hungary.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 6th] Officials announced today that after the United States ratifies the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, the United Nations occupying forces should withdraw within ninety days. If the withdrawal of Soviet troops in Hungary is delayed at that time, the responsibility should be borne solely by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] Authoritative sources told the Associated Press on the 6th that the United States does not intend to sever diplomatic relations with the new Hungarian regime. US Minister to Hungary Chapin will depart for the Hungarian capital within the month to take up his diplomatic duties.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Hungarian Army is Under Soviet Command, Hungarian Secret Police Arresting People in Austria</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hungarian Capital, 6th] Hungarian Radio broadcast tonight an official gazette issued by the Supreme National Committee, stating that the political turmoil caused by former Prime Minister Nagy's participation in a conspiracy has now been resolved within forty-eight hours, and the domestic situation is calm.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 6th] It is reported that former Hungarian Speaker of Parliament Varga, who is accused of participating in a coup conspiracy, is now hiding in Vienna. Thirty Hungarian secret police have arrived in Vienna, and the Hungarian embassy here has requested Austrian police to protect him. It is reported that Kadori, a Hungarian Peasant Party member of parliament, disappeared in Vienna two days ago and is believed to have been abducted back to Hungary.

<h3>Soviets Plan to Strike at the Truman Doctrine, Preparing to Form Balkan Federation, Romania Decides to Go to the Capital of Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Bulgarian Capital, 6th] Petkov, leader of the Peasant Party, the only opposition party in the Bulgarian Communist government, was arrested today and tried for plotting to resist the current government. At the same time, frequent news from the Balkan Peninsula indicates that the Soviet Union is planning to strike at the Truman Doctrine and rapidly consolidate its sphere of influence in Europe. Romanian Communist Prime Minister Groza and his cabinet members have departed for the capital of Yugoslavia to hold meetings. It is widely believed that a Balkan Federation ruled by the Soviet Union is being prepared there.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Bulgarian Capital, 6th] Petkov, leader of the opposition party of the Bulgarian Communist government, told reporters when he was arrested and imprisoned today that he had long expected this arrest, "but it is only an extension of past events in Hungary." His crime is closely related to two cases of plotting to resist the government. According to Government Information Bureau Director Tobenchalov, a part of the international organization intends to establish a government within Hungary, violating democracy and international interests. Petkov is the person who is realizing this claim, and his behavior is similar to that of Hungarian rebels.</p>

<h3>Disarmament Discussions Unsuccessful, Soviet Union Alone Holds Dissenting Views, Forming Stalemate</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] After five meetings, the subcommittee of the United Nations Armaments Commission, composed of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, still failed to reach a choice between the work plans proposed by the United States and the Soviet Union, and had to admit that no agreement could be reached, and the problem was returned to the Disarmament Commission for discussion. Only the Soviet Union agreed with the Soviet plan, while China, Britain, the United States, and France agreed with the US plan. The matters listed in the US plan were discussed by the Committee on Reduction of Armaments Treaties to formulate a disarmament plan, while the Soviet plan advocated establishing an atomic energy control system first, and then reducing general armaments. The subcommittee adjourned in a complete stalemate. The Disarmament Commission is now scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on Wednesday to discuss the disarmament issue anew.</p>
<h3>Gromyko Clarifies Position on International Police Force, Differing from Opinions of China, Britain, the United States, and France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 6th] Soviet representative Gromyko told the Security Council today that opinions differed greatly on the report of the Military Staff Committee on the organization of the international police force. The Soviet Union still firmly insists on the following points: (1) The number and organization of troops from the five powers participating in the international police force must be equal; (2) The amount of the international police force should be small in principle; (3) Member states of the United Nations shall not be ordered to supply bases for the international police force; (4) The troops of the United Nations member states participating in the international police force can only be stationed within their own territory; (5) After completing its mission, the international police force should withdraw from the place of mission within thirty days; (6) The United Nations member states supplying the international police force should provide the equipment and supplies needed by their national troops. Regarding the number of international police vehicles, he believes that after the defeat of Germany and Japan, there is no need to maintain a large international police force, and the General Assembly of the United Nations has already made a resolution on disarmament, so the Security Council only needs to retain a relatively small international police force at present. Gromyko further said: The requirement of bases conflicts with one of the main tasks of the United Nations organization, namely, to develop and strengthen international good-neighborly relations. If the supply of bases is stipulated when establishing the international police force, it will cause international friction and hinder the establishment of friendly relations. Finally, he strongly stated that the international police force supplied by the United Nations member states can only be stationed in their own territory or territorial waters. The points mentioned by Gromyko above are all contrary to the opinions of China, Britain, the United States, and France.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office May Oppose Bulgaria's Joining the United Nations, Bulgarian Authorities Do Not Allow Investigation Team to Enter the Country</h3>

<h3>Third Anniversary of Allied Landing in France, Truman Delivers Speech, Saying the US Must Maintain Strength to Cope with Events</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 7th, broadcast: President Truman, speaking to veterans in Kansas City on the third anniversary of the Allied landing in France, said, "If we want to support the United Nations, we must uphold the principles under which world peace is inscribed, that any nation in the world should have the right to live freely under a democratically elected institution without the threat of aggression. The way we lead the nations of the world to strive for peace is to assist nations to improve or build free and independent countries. Only by maintaining our strength can we fulfill our obligation to maintain peace. Having the intention of peace without the strength of peace is useless."</p>
<p>He continued: "Since the surrender of Germany and Japan, our troops have been disbanded, which is tantamount to encouraging some countries to take advantage of the weaknesses of peace-loving countries and harbor ambitions of aggression. This has made the countries that share our ideas and keep pace with us, but lack materials or manpower, gradually lose confidence in our maintenance of doctrine. Hitler's dream of ruling the world was actually caused by his deep belief that other countries lacked the will to resist. The calculation of the strength of democratic countries by the Nazis is gradually weakening, and their hearts are eager to prepare for war. In 1939, Hitler saw through the enemy's lack of preparation and strengthened his determination to march into Poland. Japan believed that the United States' strength could not counterattack, so it dared to attack Pearl Harbor. Therefore, we must maintain the strength of the army, navy, and air force to cope with emergencies. The organization of the army, navy, and air force should be a separate and strong military organization, and there must be a well-trained reserve army. Not only that, we must also have a sound and prosperous economic system, developed agriculture, fully developed natural resources, and a nation with a sense of responsibility and self-confidence."</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Encourages Soldiers to Maintain Firm Confidence</h3>

Without American leadership, there will immediately be great social, political, and economic chaos among billions of people. Eisenhower also mentioned that three years ago today was the day the Allied forces landed in Normandy. The 35th Division was one of the troops led by Eisenhower in Europe during World War II. He served as an artillery officer in the division during World War I. President Truman is scheduled to address the officers and soldiers of the division tomorrow night.</p>

<h3>Eight Public Utilities - Price Increases to Take Effect Tomorrow - Estimated Losses of 2.4 Billion This Month - Further Adjustments Possible Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The adjustment of public utility prices in this city has been approved by the National Price Conference. In terms of electricity prices, Shanghai Electric Power Company will increase from 325 yuan to 570 yuan per kilowatt-hour, an increase of 245 yuan. Other electric companies will increase by 319 yuan. Telephone prices will double for calls under 400, and increase by 75% for calls over 400. Other utilities such as tap water, gas, streetcars, buses, ferries, and small railways will all increase by an average of double, starting tomorrow (the 9th). However, Shanghai Electric Power Company, not receiving subsidies, has been specially permitted to implement the additional increase from May 21st in advance. Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau specially hosted the press yesterday to report on this matter, stating briefly that the National Price Conference believed that public utility agencies were incurring excessive losses. If the central government were to fully subsidize them, the national treasury would bear too heavy a burden. It was decided to allow each company to make appropriate increases in advance, in addition to maintaining the original subsidy amount. It is estimated that after the price increases, each company will still incur losses of 24 billion yuan in June. However, this is a transition from subsidized to normally adjusted prices, and the momentum should not be too sudden. The amount that all companies lack will require further remedial measures.</p>
<p>As for the future policy of the authorities regarding public utility prices, according to Director Zhao's announcement yesterday: price adjustments will be made in a gradual manner, so further adjustments may be made next month. It is said that "According to our ideals, it would be best in the future to adopt an automatic adjustment method based on the cost of living index, material prices, and exchange rates. Because public utilities absolutely must be maintained, and must be gradually developed, they cannot be allowed to decline."</p>
<p>For the convenience of citizens participating in politics, this reporter has specially listed the original prices and the newly adjusted prices of public utilities in this city below:</p>
<p>Comparison of Old and New Prices</p>

<h3>Social Security Promotion Association - Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday - Mayor Explains Reasons for Arresting Students</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Security Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 3:00 PM. Over 300 people attended, including heads of various agencies, leaders of various industries, and representatives of various people's organizations. Chairman Wang Zhengting first reported on the significance of establishing the association, stating briefly that after the victory, social order had not yet been stabilized for various reasons. Considering that the stability of a place affects the entire country, they initiated this association to gather collective wisdom and strength, unite all citizens who love society and the country, contribute money and effort, and especially bring out a sense of justice to constantly seek the stability of Shanghai society.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech stating: The prerequisite for Shanghai's prosperity should be stability, but stabilizing society is not enough with the power of the government alone, and requires the assistance of all citizens.</p>
<p>The mayor then reviewed the handling of the student unrest, saying that the safe passage of "June 2nd" should be thanked to the painstaking efforts of the security authorities. He finally explained the reasons for arresting the students, saying: Before May 25th, the following reliable information was obtained: (1) The CCP ordered students who launched the strike to resume classes quickly in order to prevent military and police authorities from arresting the ringleaders. At the same time, the striking students would also return home to rest one after another, which would affect the "June 2nd" three-strike conspiracy. (2) The New Fourth Army plainclothes team from northern Jiangsu would sneak into Shanghai, arriving before June 2nd, in order to cooperate with each other to create incidents. The mayor said: If the CCP's conspiracy succeeded, there would be a large parade of 50,000 to 60,000 people on "June 2nd." Under the protection of plainclothes personnel with weapons, they would launch a riot. The security of Shanghai was unimaginable. The security authorities weighed the pros and cons, believing that it was better to wipe out the rioters in advance to prevent the outbreak of chaos, rather than using force to suppress them afterwards and cause the citizens to suffer fear. Therefore, there was the search and arrest operation. "June 2nd" has passed, but it is still difficult to be optimistic about the future. Therefore, only by uniting all citizens to protect their own safety can stability be achieved and prosperity reached. Commander Xuan, Fang Shengwei, and Speaker Pan then gave speeches in succession. The conference passed the charter, declaration, and proposals, and elected the directors and supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Renowned lawyer Shen Junru has recently been sued by Gao Jingqing in the Civil Division of the High Court, stating briefly that when Shen was the Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, the Democratic League had drafted a list of representatives to participate in the National Assembly and handed it over to Shen for safekeeping. Now that Shen is about to leave the Democratic League and form other political parties, the list has not been handed over. Gao therefore filed a self-accusation in the Civil Division of the High Court on the grounds of "obstructing civil rights," based on Articles 1 and 342 of the Civil Procedure Law, and requested the handover of the documents.</p>
<p>Considering this matter to be quite bizarre, this reporter visited Mr. Shen, who said: He also knows about this matter, but he has never served as the Secretary-General of the Democratic League, and the Democratic League has never drafted a list of representatives to the National Assembly. Furthermore, he has no intention of leaving the Democratic League so far. He does not know Gao Jingqing at all and repeatedly said that he does not know what the intention is. Finally, he said: This person may have mental illness.</p>

<h3>Batch of Air Force Personnel Returned to Shanghai After Completing Studies: Received Rigorous Specialized Training in the United States</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A batch of 212 Chinese Air Force personnel who were trained in the United States returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM aboard the General Aujtman. Reporters interviewed Major Ma Fukuan, the leader of the group, and Lieutenant Zhou Dingcai, a member of the group, about their training in the United States. It was reported that most of the returning Air Force officers and soldiers are ground crew personnel, some of whom were recruited in Kunming and Guiyang during the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, and some of whom were selected from the Air Force Mechanical School. They received specialized training in the United States, such as in mechanics, aerial photography, artillery, bombsights, and medicine. The length of the training varied depending on the subject, with mechanics taking over two years and others taking at least eight months. All officers and soldiers were first required to undergo three months of recruit training at Fort Sam Houston in Texas, the rigor of which far exceeded that in China. Many with slightly weaker physiques fell ill. After completing recruit training, they were assigned to airfields in Mississippi, Texas, Illinois, and Colorado to study specialized subjects. The training method focused on practice with less theory, but the discipline was extremely strict. It is estimated that the cost of teaching materials was about 20 to 30 US dollars per hour. Their living expenses in the United States were paid by our government, with officers receiving 140 to 190 US dollars per month and students and soldiers receiving about 60 US dollars per month. However, the students and soldiers received most of their clothing and food from the camp, while the officers had to take care of everything themselves and maintain their status by attending social events, which was a bitter experience. The attitude of Americans towards them has changed greatly due to the civil war in China, and they were often questioned about "why China is still fighting a civil war after the victory," leaving them speechless and very distressed. After returning to China, they will be assigned work by the Air Force Headquarters. There are still about 300 people receiving training in the United States, and another 100 or so who have completed training and will return to China in the near future.</p>

<h3>Negotiations in Nanjing Yield No Results, China Stocks Collapse Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>China stocks initially declined yesterday before stabilizing, but collapsed again near noon due to the lack of results from negotiations in Nanjing.

The morning opened with a slight decline. After Diyi Textile opened, Nos. 24, 85, 47, 71, 31, 218, 223, and 224 were sold to 5,850 yuan.

At this time, investor confidence remained stable because the Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams still showed 14.4 yuan. Nos. 152 and 190 were still being purchased, pulling prices back to the 6,000 yuan mark. After 11:00 AM, it was heard that Assistant Manager Gu had returned to Shanghai and that the proposal he carried had not been approved. Investor panic led to widespread selling. With little trading, Nos. 65, 46, 171, 224, 141, 186, 223, 234, and 143 were repeatedly sold, creating an oversupply. Near noon, Diyi Textile was forced down to 5,560 yuan, approaching its decline limit. Match stocks were suspended at their decline limit.

For current delivery stocks, Yongsheng Textile, Xinhua Trust, and China fell by about 10%, while Xinguang, Yonggong, Qin, and Jing fell by 5%. Old off-market stocks declined again.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Stable, Foreign Stocks Hover</h3>
<p>Government bonds initially weakened before stabilizing yesterday. A major investor, Dong, purchased more than 4 million yuan. The supply from retail investors was not large, leading to this situation. National Bonds C opened at 6,800 yuan and then hovered higher, stabilizing after rising to 8,700 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, the rise and fall of all bonds were minimal, with a turnover of about 6-7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Although foreign investors purchased foreign stocks yesterday, the amount was not large. Securities firms still showed an appetite, while banks were selling. The Hong Kong and Shanghai telegram showed 14.4 yuan, which did not have much impact on the market. Yi Silk opened strong at 61,000 yuan and then declined to 57,000 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yi Silk and Steel fell, while British Union, Huade, Xingye, Guangdong Paper, Yi Beer, and Aviation each declined by 5%.</p>
<h3>Brokers Subscribing to U.S. Dollar Bonds, Ministry of Finance Does Not Allow Changes to Principles</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Gu Shanchang, the assistant manager of the stock exchange, returned to Shanghai at around 8:00 AM yesterday after traveling to Nanjing on the 5th to request instructions from the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs regarding brokers' subscription to U.S. dollar bonds. He told reporters: During this trip to Nanjing, he discussed the views of the brokers with Director Dai of the Ministry of Finance and Director Deng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The authorities stated that they deeply understood the difficulties currently faced by the brokers. However, the principles of the measures decided by the two ministries could not be changed. In terms of handling the measures, they might wait for the two ministries to consult and then formally send a letter to the stock exchange for verification. In addition, the four types of stocks applying for listing are also under review.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Quota Allocation of Citizen Status and Other Issues, the Transportation and Management Committee Issues a Statement Regarding the Registration Standards for Manufacturers as Stipulated by the Executive Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Transportation and Management Committee issued a statement regarding: (1) the review and verification of importer registrations in Appendix 2, and (2) the allocation of imported goods in Appendix 2. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the registration of "Category A" applicants for goods in Appendix 2 due to insufficient quota allocation, it is deeply feared that inequality is the real problem, not scarcity. However, general manufacturers often misunderstand this due to failing the registration. However, according to the Committee, the registration standards were stipulated after repeated careful consideration by the Executive Committee, and the Registration Department implements the review based on these standards. As of the end of May this year, a total of over 500 manufacturers have registered for various goods, of which 60% are domestic manufacturers and 40% are foreign merchants. The claim of favoring foreign merchants is entirely unfounded. The roster of registered manufacturers for each category is kept in the Registration Department and is available for reference at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the allocation of quota goods for the first quarter, as of now, except for rayon and burlap bags, the rest of the goods, namely rice, wheat, and wheat flour, are under the overall control of the government. Coal and coke are allocated by the Fuel Management Committee. Ammonium sulfate, cement, fertilizer, and pharmaceuticals are temporarily suspended from import. Other goods requiring allocation have been handled separately.</p>
<p>The allocation standards are as follows: (1) Industrial raw materials that need to be centralized are directly allocated to factory users, with industry associations reviewing the capacity of each factory. Goods for centralized consumption are allocated to qualified registered importers. The Committee convenes a public negotiation with the importers to determine the quota on the spot. Because the situation of each commodity is different, some use the 1946 import volume as a benchmark, some refer to the pre-war import volume, some evenly divide a small portion, and the rest is allocated according to the agreed standards. The management capabilities of each merchant are also considered, and a minimum amount is stipulated, with the remainder calculated according to the standard.</p>
<p>The above allocations are all decided by the merchants themselves through negotiation, so there is no possibility or need for coercion. However, industrial goods with approved quotas must be sold to users, and sales contracts must be obtained and co-signed by the buyer's industry association before approval is granted.</p>
<h3>Kailuan Coal to be Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is actively working to dredge the source of coal supply, starting with Kailuan. It is expected that at least 100,000 to 120,000 tons of Kailuan coal can be delivered to Shanghai by the end of this month. The transformation process is as follows: Recognizing that the Tangshan mining area and the Tianjin Railway Bureau urgently need flour, the Committee has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, requesting the Ministry of Food to instruct the Central Trust Bureau to sell some of its foreign flour stocks to encourage cooperation and seek various conveniences. The method is as follows: If 100,000 tons of coal are transported to Shanghai each month, the Central Trust Bureau will sell 80,000 bags of flour to the Kailuan authorities at market prices, and another 40,000 bags to the Beiping Tianjin Railway Bureau. If the total amount of coal shipped to Shanghai exceeds the quota, an additional 10,000 bags of flour will be sold to each of the above two institutions for each additional ton of coal.</p>
<p>Kailuan has abundant production, averaging about 14,000 tons per day, with stocks reaching over 200,000 tons. Furthermore, Shanghai's monthly regular demand is 160,000 to 170,000 tons, supplemented by sources from Northeast China and Taiwan. The coal shortage problem will be gradually resolved.</p>
<h3>A Glimmer of Hope for Tea Exports; A Batch of Old Tea to be Returned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chinese tea is still favored overseas, but the asking price is exceptionally harsh, hindering the recovery of exports for a long time. Recently, several Chinese export firms, in order to actively expand their market, continue to endure losses and export, resulting in a faint glimmer of hope in the previously quiet trading with foreign firms yesterday. Various teas for domestic sale are being inquired about by both local and out-of-town merchants, and the situation is still good, stabilizing sentiment. Prices are slightly tighter than before.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Recently, rumors have spread in the market that over 100,000 pounds of Chinese tea will be returned from abroad. For this reason, the reporter paid a special visit to a prominent tea merchant yesterday. According to him, this is indeed the case. Several months ago, a certain tea export firm in the city shipped deteriorated old tea that had been stored for many years overseas. It is said that once the tea arrived, it was not welcomed by the locals and is now planned to be shipped back to China. Observing the current situation, with Chinese tea declining and Chinese tea merchants not realizing this, the future is worrying.</p>
<h3>Extensive Distribution of Goods; Difficulty in Reversing the Decline of Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market remained bearish. Dealers were reluctant to replenish their stocks, and the market's financial situation was tight, causing holders to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Ten sticks of Great British cigarettes traded at 6.25 million yuan, with very little trading. Even a slight drop to 150,000 yuan could only attract sporadic purchases. Old Knife cigarettes also lacked sales. In the afternoon, it was rumored that Yongtaihe would continue to distribute goods to local dealers next week, and He Cheng Company would also distribute twenty sticks of "Iron Tower" brand cigarettes, setting the market price at 4 million yuan for five thousand sticks, leading to even more sluggish market sentiment and weak trading. The closing price for ten sticks of Great British cigarettes fell again to 6.11 million yuan, a decrease of 155,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes also fell by 185,000 yuan, Five Hua cigarettes were stable, while other American strip cigarettes and Da Nan Wei Da San Pao cigarettes saw little trading. Only Chinese-made cigarettes had relatively firm sales due to strong demand.</p>
<h3>Stagnant Hardware Market</h3>
<p>Hardware prices have not improved this week. Although manufacturers' wages have increased, and the prices of their products have also risen accordingly, they are unable to increase prices due to sluggish actual sales.</p>
<h3>Stable Chinese Medicine Market</h3>
<p>After rising, the Chinese medicine market has stabilized. However, due to sluggish sales and falling prices, high-priced medicines are becoming a burden.</p>
<h3>Continued Decline in Yarn and Cloth Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market declined because yarn factories were selling off their stocks, and importers were reluctant to absorb them due to the availability of foreign exchange for importing American cotton. Demand from this province was also weak, causing yarn prices to fall. The final price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 12.55 million yuan, a further decrease of 350,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 10-count Double Horse yarn opened strong at 7.75 million yuan, but due to weak trading and sluggish sentiment, the closing price fell slightly to 7.65 million yuan, a decrease of 130,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other yarn counts also fell by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened steadily. However, because dyeing factories found that processing dyeing was not profitable, they sold off white grey cloth. Importers were also hesitant because the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, and money was becoming tight. Additionally, due to the busy farming season in the countryside, actual sales were weak. Throughout the day, except for seasonal fabrics that were able to hold their ground, all 12-count and various grades of fine cloth fell by 2,000 to 5,000 yuan. Twill and serge fabrics also fell by 2,000 to 6,000 or 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton futures rose, Indian cotton was stable. In the Shanghai spot cotton market, transactions were not very active due to tight money. Only Hengfeng Yarn Factory purchased 100 bales each of Shashi and Lao Hukou cotton for half a month, and Jiafeng Yarn Factory purchased 118 bales of Lingbao cotton, maintaining relatively firm prices.</p>
<h3>National Bank Industrial Loan Committee Approves Loans of 3.5 Billion</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Industrial Loan Review Committee of the Central Bank Discount and Loan Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM the other day. 14 people attended, including Zhu Tongjiu. They discussed and reviewed 32 loan applications, approving 21 of them, totaling 3.54 billion yuan. 7 applications were rejected, and 4 were deferred for further discussion.</p>

<h3>Changchun Launches Major Mobilization: New Perspectives During the Defense War</h3>
<p>— By Our Correspondent Fang Ren, Changchun, 2nd (Air Mail)</p>
<p>Changchun has become an iron city. This steel-like character is not only reflected in its fortifications but also in the morale and spirit of its people.</p>
<p>In May, exactly one year after the National Army recaptured Changchun, the Communist forces north of the Songhua River launched their fifth offensive, the so-called "Summer Offensive" or, as the captured Communists called it, "The Fifth Assault Across the River."</p>
<p>Changchun, a famous city south of the Songhua River, and Harbin, north of the river, are both resounding names. Since the Communists were "Assaulting Across the River," Changchun bore the brunt. Thus, in the northeast wilderness in May, just as the wind had rustled the branches, the lakes and rivers had barely thawed, and ripples and emerald waves had appeared, frogs were croaking serenades under the moonlight, and farmers had just leveled the paddies and were hurrying to sow the seeds, the Communist forces north of the Songhua River sounded their bugles, and the flames of war rose in the wilderness. The murderous waves swept from Fuyu in the northwest corner of Changchun to Fulongquan in Nongan. On May 17th, they swept south and overwhelmed Huaide, an important town west of Gongzhuling on the Changchun Railway. By the 19th, they had crossed Gongzhuling and Fanjiatun, north of Gongzhuling. At this point, Changchun was surrounded on three sides. Fierce battles broke out at Dafangshen, the airport on the western edge of the city, and Kuanchengzi, north of the city. The sounds of gunfire and artillery shells clearly echoed across the skies of Changchun for several days.</p>
<p>Numerous Extraordinary Experiences</p>
<p>The people of Changchun had been through a great fright. Among their numerous extraordinary experiences, although they had encountered four Communist offensives in the spring, they had never heard such intense and frequent gunfire and artillery shelling, nor had they felt such a suffocating atmosphere. The past year was still fresh in their minds. Events like the "May 23rd" and "April 14th" incidents, as well as the long and chaotic period from the "August 15th" liberation two years ago until last year's "May 23rd" incident, were simply not as threatening as the current three-sided encirclement of Changchun. This time, the "Tiger Tanks" seen during the "April 14th" incident were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>However, this was a very moving scene: the people of Changchun, who had not been seen to do so before, launched a great mobilization to defend greater Changchun.</p>
<p>Building an Air Base in Four Days</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the slogan "Those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money" was often heard. This time, Changchun not only "contributed strength and money" but also "those with money contributed strength."</p>
<p>After voluntarily doing a great deal of logistical work, the city government issued an order on May 24th – the day after the anniversary of Changchun's recapture. Without coercion, it mobilized 100,000 people, who, with overflowing enthusiasm, built an air base within the city's defensive line in four days. It was larger than the Coral Airport in Chongqing, and constructed endless deep trenches and high ramparts outside the city's defensive line. They called these fortifications "trenches." Although the project was not yet fully completed when this article was submitted, 95% of the work had already been completed.</p>
<p>The Latent Power of New Actions</p>
<p>The participants in this project were Changchun citizens aged 18 to 51. They included shop assistants, artisans, students, civil servants, laborers, and even university professors. All of them wielded shovels, and in that scene, one could not help but understand the meaning of the idiom "unity is strength." In addition, it made one realize that the months of indifference had given them the latent power for today's actions, namely, the unforgettable disgust and hatred for certain ambitious individuals that had accumulated during the long and chaotic period from "August 15th" two years ago to "May 23rd" last year.</p>
<p>As of this writing, it cannot be said that Changchun is no longer in the midst of a defensive war. The flames of war have spread from the Songjiang River basin to the Liaohe River plain. Throughout the northeast, there are few places where the sound of bugles is not heard. However, Changchun has become an iron city. This "iron" is not only reflected in its fortifications but also in the morale and spirit of its people!</p>

<h3>Hailstorms Plague Henan Province; Large Ones Like Chicken Eggs, Small Ones Like Apricot Dates; The Whole Province is Filled with Mourning, Hoping for Effective Relief</h3>
<p>— Kaifeng, 2nd (Dispatch) Our Correspondent Bo Quan</p>
<p>The people of Henan province have suffered greatly from the ravages of war, wandering and displaced. During this time, counties such as Xuchang, Wuzhi, Zhenping, and Yanshi have recently been repeatedly hit by hailstorms, with hailstones as large as chicken eggs and as small as apricot dates. With the wheat crop nearing harvest, this unexpected disaster has left the people wondering how they will survive. A summary of the hailstorm situation in each county is as follows:</p>
<p>Xuchang: The Northeast Suburbs Are the Worst Hit, Residents Cry Uncontrollably</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 16th, a hailstorm caused disaster, with a dire situation in the east. In towns such as Balong, Xiaozhao, and Wujie in the northeast suburbs, many houses were destroyed by the hailstorm, and nine out of ten of the crops were destroyed. The entire region was filled with mourning, a heart-wrenching sight. The hailstones were as large as walnuts. The hailstones in the vegetable gardens were as high as the garden walls. In Shibei and Chenzhuang, five miles from the city, more than ninety of the hundred-odd houses were destroyed. Large trees that could be encircled by two arms were also felled. A resident named Chen in the village had only eight acres of wheat, which were now destroyed. Yesterday, he came to the city, crying uncontrollably, intending to commit suicide, which moved those who heard him to tears.</p>
<p>Wuzhi: Hailstorm Lasts 20 Minutes, Two Inches Thick and Six Li Wide</p>
<p>In Guyang Township in the east of the county, at around 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, a strong wind suddenly blew, followed by a dense hailstorm with hailstones as large as apricot dates. It lasted for twenty minutes, and the accumulated hail on the ground was two inches thick, covering an area about six li wide and fifteen li long. All of the wheat crop was destroyed. With no hope of harvesting, the people cried to the heavens. In particular, they were burdened by extremely high grain prices, causing great panic in their lives. The area affected by the severe disaster is about 300 hectares. In other less affected areas, many wheat ears have also fallen to the ground and are not bearing fruit. It is hoped that the authorities will take measures to provide relief and reduce the burden on the people.</p>
<p>Zhenping: Black Frost Has Already Fallen Three Times, Now Hailstorms Also Wreak Havoc</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, there was a heavy thunderstorm, and a hailstorm suddenly descended with extreme force. The towns of Chengyuan, Pengying, Xingshan, and Yuting were the most severely affected. The hailstones were as large as fists and as small as apricot dates. People and animals were injured and killed. The wheat, soybeans, and early autumn crops were all completely destroyed. The people cried out in despair. Zhenping had already experienced three black frosts in February, and now it has been hit by hailstorms. The people are truly unable to survive and urgently need help. It is hoped that the authorities will provide effective relief to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Yanshi: Most of the Wheat Ears Have Been Blown Off; Sweet Potatoes and Cotton Have Suffered Great Damage</p>
<p>Both the large and small wheat crops are nearing maturity. Unexpectedly, on May 15th, a strong wind arose, and within a day and night, most of the wheat ears were blown off. As of the afternoon of the 16th, the wind not only intensified but also brought hailstorms as large as apricots. All wheat, sweet potatoes, and cotton crops have suffered significant damage. According to preliminary investigations, the Mangling area is particularly severely affected.</p>

<h3>Talking about Vocal Music Appreciation</h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>Since Jiang Ying's solo recital, I only felt that with my superficial musical knowledge and auditory experience, I couldn't possibly critique her singing achievements. However, it did spark some thoughts in me about "vocal music appreciation."</p>
<p>Understanding Authentic European Singing Art is Not an Innate Ability but a Subject of Study</p>
<p>The general Chinese public often prefers "Qingyi" in Peking opera and is less welcoming of "lyric sopranos." In particular, the "Aria" and "Recitative" in opera simply drive them crazy - even though they are the highest techniques in the world of vocal music.</p>
<p>Whether it's art songs or the "Arias" sung by major characters in European operas, the lyrics are often in Italian, German, French, or Russian (the United States and the United Kingdom have not made special contributions to musical art). If the audience does not have a considerable foundation in European languages, then naturally the singing of these authentic European songs will "fall on deaf ears." For example, Ms. Jiang's solo recital program included opera works by the German Mozart (Mozart's father was German, but Mozart himself was born in Austria), the French Bizet, and the Italian Puccini and Verdi. When you are in a solo recital, even if you can't master several languages, at least the pronunciation of those languages or the general meaning of the lyrics should be clear. Only then can you know whether the soloist's articulation is clear, the pronunciation is accurate, and the emotional delivery is appropriate.</p>
<p>Vocal music recitals mostly feature "Arias" from operas. If you usually don't care about the history of Western literature and its combination with music, and don't know which literary work or which Greek myth the opera content is taken from, how can you appreciate the performance of these opera selections? Jiang Ying's solo recital program included "Arias" from operas such as Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro," Verdi's "Il Trovatore," and Bizet's "Carmen." These are all famous opera composers from the 18th century onwards, from modern and contemporary times. A solo recital cannot be without the works of these great men. Listening to pure art solo recitals requires some literary knowledge, unlike listening to anti-Japanese war songs or ballroom music, which is much easier.</p>
<p>There is an unhealthy concept: believing that why should the Chinese only learn foreign songs? I think art should not have national boundaries. The thing that has the highest status and the most advanced techniques in the world of culture is shared by all mankind, regardless of which country it comes from.</p>
<p>After all, the musical arts of Germany and Italy have radiated brilliance to human culture. We can't think that those skills are not worth studying just because they originated from foreign countries. Even the United Kingdom and the United States have never thought like this.</p>
<p>(If we compare Chinese and Western songs, our language pronunciation is at a fundamental disadvantage.)</p>
<p>Secondly, appreciating a solo recital also requires understanding vocal music methods and techniques. This understanding is not based on your subjective perception of whether the sound is clear or whether the singing is graceful. You can't just "draw a final conclusion" to determine the soloist's performance. If it is a "lyric soprano," you should be able to hear whether her timbre and volume are appropriate. You should know the difference between a "lyric soprano" and a "dramatic soprano." In this regard, Jiang Ying is quite competent.</p>
<p>In the first piece of Jiang Xiaoru's solo recital, Gluck's "O del mio dolce ardor," you should discover how she applies the "touchstone" of European singing art – "the beautiful connection between the notes of yesterday and today." Then you can criticize.</p>
<p>In addition, you must have considerable judgment on the handling of techniques such as "vibrato," "staccato," and "penetrating sound," as well as the application of emotional changes. This judgment is not given by God but relies on your ear's experience and your innate "musical sensitivity."</p>
<p>Often, the solo recital itself is successful, but some people in the audience are just there to show their faces or smell the flowers. (Note: During the solo recital, the stage was filled with flower baskets, and the fragrance was refreshing.)</p>
<p>From the most superficial point of view, when appreciating Jiang Jun's solo recital, we can appreciate how skilled the soloist is in terms of singing posture and emotional delivery. In the first program, she adopted a normal posture (holding her hands tightly in front, moving them up and down), which aptly showed the passion of the song praising great "love." When singing the second piece, "Evening Sun Song," the tune was very peaceful, and her posture was also relaxed, with her right hand lightly supporting the piano and her left hand hanging down naturally. When she was called back (Encore) and sang two authentic Chinese folk songs, "Daoqing" and "Fengyang Flower Drum," her expression and movements were even more sweet and lovely, making people aware of her cultivation in opera. In terms of emotion, she also achieved "dissolving the emotional stimulation she got from the lyrics into every note," so the whole song showed varying shades of depth. Although these are very superficial conditions, they are techniques that every vocalist finds difficult to achieve perfectly.</p>
<p>Jiang Ying's solo recital made me think about the difficulty of vocal music techniques and the difficulty of appreciation.</p>
<h3>Raising Geese</h3>

<p>[One of the Exhibits in the Children's Labor and Art Exhibition]</p>
<h3>Viewing Miss Xiao Shufang's Art Exhibition (Two Essays)</h3>
<p>1.  Sun Qiucao</p>
<p>Early summer is the season when grass flourishes south of the Yangtze River. After a long period of silence, several female artists' oil painting exhibitions have appeared one after another in foreign circles. Following Miss Tang Yunyu's exhibition at the Da Xin Gallery, Miss Zhang Liying held a pre-departure exhibition at the French Association Library, which was sincere in attitude and exquisite in content. Now Miss Xiao Shufang will exhibit her recent works at the Qingnian Hui Gengtang Hall. These are all exciting news.</p>
<p>Although we are in an era of suffering. In Shanghai, which is known as the national economic and cultural hub, when all social phenomena appear more indifferent, the general public regards art as nothing more than a luxurious decoration. And the concept of appreciating Western paintings is especially weak. However, an art creator who can be serious about themselves and bury themselves in their work in such a suffocating environment, their sincere and dedicated attitude is always worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Miss Xiao Shufang went abroad at an early age and spent a long time studying painting. Because the author has a good mastery of the techniques of garden painting, and is influenced by the Impressionist style that inspired new ideas in modern painting, the clear and changing style she expresses has aroused the appreciation of many connoisseurs.</p>
<p>From many compositions, the author especially loves children and flowers. Yes, in this world, besides the innocent smiles of children and the pure and flawless, flourishing flowers that symbolize happiness, peace, and tranquility, what else can evoke reminiscences from the bottom of one's heart more naturally?</p>
<p>However, we are still confined to an era of suffering, and all beautiful imaginations cannot conceal the misery we derive from reality. The realm of art needs to be explored, and the relationship between art and life is inseparable. I hope that art creators will reveal their true feelings and express them using their different techniques. Even if there is not necessarily such an achievement, one must have such a mind. I cherish every creator and cannot help but have such demanding expectations, and Miss Xiao Shufang is naturally no exception. In this way, my shallow views on a technically successful creator may not be regarded as reckless.</p>
<p>2.  Yu Lu</p>
<p>I remember when Miss Shufang held an art exhibition in London in the spring of the 28th year of the Republic of China, I wrote a newsletter and sent it to the Hong Kong National Daily for publication, recording that event from afar. At that time, Miss Shufang's works were mostly ink paintings, introducing the brushstrokes and style of Chinese art to an international audience, which won unanimous praise from the London society. However, Miss Shufang's art exhibition at the Qingnian Hui is her first time in China, and perhaps the general public is still unfamiliar with her, so after viewing her exhibition this time, I am willing to introduce her again.</p>
<p>Miss Xiao is the niece of the late Mr. Xiao Youmei, the former president of the National Conservatory of Music. She has loved art since she was a child and studied at the Beiping Art College and the Art Department of Central University, achieving remarkable results. She went abroad to study at the Paris and London Art Colleges, seeking further education. The oil paintings in this exhibition are mostly works created abroad and during her travels after returning to China, especially her deep love for the scenery of Switzerland and Beiping. Among the twenty-nine landscape paintings, sketches from the two places account for as many as seventeen. Other sketches were also created in Moganshan, Guling, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Paris, and London. In terms of ink paintings, there are also twenty-two landscape paintings, most of which are also sketches.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of portraits, they are all lifelike and vivid. The most admirable of these are the portraits of children, some sitting, some sleeping, and some breastfeeding, all of which capture their innocent and naive expressions with the brush and bring them to life on paper. In this exhibition, there are four oil portraits and thirteen ink portraits, most of which are not priced and are only for the audience to appreciate.</p>
<p>In terms of still life, flowers and plants are the most common, especially the bottle of flowers in the oil studio, which boldly uses bright colors and deliberately renders them without losing their realistic and lifelike charm.</p>
<p>Miss Xiao is a talented artist. Now is just the initial stage of her journey to the palace of art, and she has already achieved great accomplishments in both oil and ink painting. We should encourage her to work harder, accept more criticism, and let her talent be fully developed, shining brightly in the Chinese art world.</p>
<h3>Huangshan Painter Xu Shiqi</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>Brother Shiqi is an old friend of many years, and I have seen many of his great works. However, my relationship with him progressed from a common colleague to a good friend due to something that seemed unrelated to art—even contradictory to art. Long before the War of Resistance, I went to visit Brother Shiqi one day. He said to me: "Brother Zhongnian, you've come at the right time. There's something you may not have seen before. There!" He pointed to a pile of flesh and blood. At first glance, it looked like a skinned rabbit, but his head told me it was a newborn baby! At that time, he was also the director of the Physiological Model Department of the Department of Health, and he was dissecting.</p>
<p>At that time, I had a feeling: all art takes emotion as its soul, and all science takes reason as its foundation. An art professor performing a dissection, is this not a contradiction? On closer thought, it is not. Emotion is not necessarily blind. Putting aside art for the moment, let's look at music and poetry, which are the most important emotions. Outside of "art," there is also "skill": emotion is the driving force of music and poetry, but the expression of this driving force must go through reason: emotion and reason do not conflict but complement each other here. So, why not let Xu Shiqi in the dissection room put down his butcher knife and immediately go to the treasure room to pick up a pen and paint?</p>
<p>Combining emotion with reason is such a delightful thing! How delightful and admirable it is to be able to harmonize emotion and reason without any separation! Therefore, I deeply understand Shiqi, and my friendship with him has deepened. In his paintings, this spirit of harmony and seamlessness between emotion and reason is fully expressed. Composition, brushwork, color, etc., are all rationalized, but everywhere is full of emotion.</p>
<p>He is from the foot of Huangshan: his eyes are full of scenery, his heart is full of paintings, he speaks to the guest and his brush moves, and the painting comes to his wrist. He is capable of anything in painting, and he especially remembers the scenery of Huangshan. Brother Chongpeng said: "Xu's landscape paintings like to create strange peaks and rocks, ancient pines and white clouds, which are the scenery of his hometown Huangshan; his brushwork is vigorous and mellow, with a similar effect to Mei Qing's mountains. His flowers and birds are between Lü Ji, Bian Wenjin, and Xinluo Baiyang. As for his figures, he focuses on sketching, with lively expressions, which benefits from his anatomical attainments, not by chance." I also think so of this Huangshan painter who skinned a baby.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour, Zheng Yan himself changed his plan, but did not rush back to Bai Ren Manor to attend the meeting. He only used the telephone to tell He Jian the most important secret message, and asked He Jian to let him stay in the telecommunications department to wait for other news and notify him at any time. He Jian of course agreed with Zheng Yan's proposal, and praised him for making real progress in his studies.</p>
<p>This important secret message from Zheng Yan was sent by "〇十二", saying that in Konoe's villa in Tokyo, there are now two largest "force flows" producing "sharp friction"; the so-called two "force flows" naturally refer to the army and navy. Because of this friction, Konoe's "expedition order" can only be temporarily suspended. However, this "temporary" is truly extremely temporary, at most only one or two hours, waiting for Konoe's men to negotiate the reasons and conditions for the friction between the army and navy, and after the two sides reach an agreement, the expedition order can be issued immediately; the Japanese garrison and spies in China can still launch an offensive on time.</p>
<p>While He Jian and the think tank of Bai Ren Manor were discussing the plan, Ping Zi was alone in a small guest room, arranging her arts. At the same time, outside the window of the small guest room, there were five or six pairs of eyes lurking in the dark, peeking intently. Among these five or six pairs of eyes, there were of course the four mischievous ones, one pair each, plus the youngest brother among the men of Bai Ren Manor, Tang Guanyi. He is the brother of He Jian and the head of telecommunications at Bai Ren Manor.</p>
<p>Ping Zi's arrangement was very simple. She pasted Elder Aoki's mysterious letter on a large square mirror, and this mirror was placed on a small round table for worship. Paper and pens were also placed on the table as preparation for recording inspiration and messages. Ping Zi finished the arrangement, turned off the lights in the room, and knelt quietly on a square stool that had been padded in front of the table, silently contemplating.</p>
<p>"Old Yue... big brother, hypnosis, or mentalism, or metaphysics, what are these things all about?"</p>
<p>He Jian received my urgent telegram and other secret messages from both sides, and rushed from Shanghai to Beiping. He told me everything that happened in Shanghai, and when he talked about Ping Zi and the old Jue Chang using mentalism to explore Elder Aoki's mysterious book, he suddenly asked me this question.</p>
<p>"You don't quite believe it, thinking it's too mysterious and too superstitious, right?" I didn't explain to him, but instead asked him this question.</p>
<p>"You say it's credible, but I've tried it myself a hundred times, and there's not one time that it works... I'll tell you, big brother, I did something embarrassing this time in Shanghai; maybe you won't believe it..." He Jian said here, and suddenly laughed himself.</p>
<p>"What's the embarrassing thing?"</p>
<p>"You don't know, after Ping Zi disappeared in Shanghai, I was so anxious about the mission of this trip. In the International Hotel, after Shouyi and the others left, before that fierce lady came, I suddenly thought of the trick of telepathy. I thought, why don't I use this method to find out Ping Zi's whereabouts? Fortunately, Ping Zi has used the trick on me, and I have used the trick to resist, we should be telepathically connected. Thinking of this, I immediately hypnotized myself. Do you know what the result was?"</p>
<p>"What was it?" I asked him curiously.</p>
<p>"The more I tried to hypnotize myself, the less I felt anything, and instead I fell sound asleep..." (He Jian)</p>
<p>"That may be because you were too tired."</p>
<p>"But if you don't believe in this stuff, it's a bit strange. Just take this time at Bai Ren Manor, I and their manor's think tank just drafted an outline of the plan, and the results of Ping Zi and the old Jue Chang's telepathic communication were all sent over for us to refer to..." (He Jian)</p>
<h3>Scenery of Huangshan</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuxi</p>
<p>The scenery of Huangshan is unique and outstanding, and all visitors marvel at it. Mr. Xu Shiqi grew up at the foot of Huangshan, blessed by the spirits of famous mountains. He has climbed it since childhood, and has been especially inspired by the strange peaks and ancient pines. Therefore, his paintings and his personality are both full of lofty and transcendent spirits. Looking at his works, all landscapes have the ancient framework of Huangshan, and even his flowers and birds have the demeanor of being as stern as ice and frost, which is unattainable by ordinary people.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, Mr. Xu lived in Baishu Village, Shapingba, Chongqing. Several banana trees were planted in front of the door, and the silk shade filled the windows. In the studio, painting albums and paper, brushes, and pigments were displayed. After several years of diligent cultivation, he has made rapid progress. Hanging in the studio is a couplet written by Gao Luopei, a Dutch friend of Xu:</p>
<p>"The quiet heart has many mysteries, and floating thoughts are not common." This is truly a wonderful collection of sentences describing his personality and treasures.</p>
<p>Last autumn, Mr. Xu founded Huangshan Art Garden in Shanghai, with elegant arrangements, which is not only more spacious than his Chongqing Shapingba studio. In this elegant Art Garden, the host occasionally lectures and mentors students, and can especially calm his mind and paint in a relaxed and happy mood.</p>
<p>The noble character of Mr. Xu has been understood by readers. Now, I will copy another couplet written by He Zizhen in Mr. Xu's book as an ending:</p>
<p>"Listening to ancient music by the flowing water, admiring great sages when encountering towering mountains."</p>
<p>Although the times are different, the artist's mood and the unrestrainedness of his mind are conveyed between the lines.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Random Talk</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>I am reminded of what a witty philosopher said:</p>
<p>"If a person's work is completed, his life will inevitably become a burden to him. Therefore, there is a second work to eliminate his life; the meaning of this is to reduce boredom."</p>
<p>"Boredom" is like an eagle flying in the sky. If it glimpses that life has obtained its needs, it prepares to seize.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first work is to engage in something that can be gained; the second work is to dispel the complacent emotions after gaining something; otherwise, life will become a burden.</p>
<p>I deeply like the above insights.</p>
<p>I feel that the reason why the current world is so sad is that most people have not yet completed the first work, and it can even be said that they have not yet started the work of "gaining something"; and a very small number of so-called "successful people" are already developing their second work, impatiently scratching their own monkey ears.</p>
<p>There are two Chinese idioms:</p>
<p>"Heavenly principles are originally without incident, but mediocre people disturb themselves."</p>
<p>I think the "mediocre people" in these two sentences probably refer to those noble people who are too idle.</p>
<p>"Boredom" is really terrible - it can corrupt human nature.</p>
<p>If God placed "boredom" and "hunger" in front of me and asked me to choose one of them, I would undoubtedly choose "hunger" and leave.</p>
<h3>The Fall of the Great Ming Empire — Miscellaneous Notes on Reading History, Part Six</h3>
<p>— Xiao Dai</p>
<p>The dozen or so years before the Yongle period of the Great Ming Empire can be considered relatively peaceful. From the beginning of Yongle to the beginning of Chongzhen, a period of two hundred years, there was almost no year without war. By the end of the dynasty, due to the sharpening of the ruling forces' own corruption, coupled with years of famine, it reached the point where "fathers abandoned their sons, husbands abandoned their wives; some dug up grass roots to eat, and some dug up white stones to fill their hunger." The country was facing insufficient income and lack of military pay, which led to mutiny. As a result, those starving people and mutinous soldiers rose up in rebellion.</p>
<p>Among the leaders of this rebellion, the more notable ones were Gao Yingxiang, who called himself King Chuang, and Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, who called themselves General Chuang. They possessed thirty-six battalions with over two hundred thousand troops. Li Zicheng disturbed the Yellow River basin, and Zhang Xianzhong disturbed the Yangtze River basin. At its peak, they had a million troops, with 400,000 infantry and 600,000 cavalry, attacking cities and seizing land everywhere. In the process of the uprising, in order to gain popular support, Li Zicheng issued such military orders: "No one is allowed to hide silver, no one is allowed to live indoors in cities, and no women other than wives and daughters are allowed to be taken along", "Anyone who has a horse mixed in the ranks will be beheaded, and anyone whose horse tramples on fields will be beheaded", "The daughters and treasures of the captured cities will be divided equally." It is said that such military orders had a great effect. By March of the seventeenth year of Chongzhen, the rule of the Great Ming Empire had completely collapsed. The History of Ming records:</p>
<p>"On the eighteenth, the rebels attacked even more fiercely. Zicheng stationed outside Zhangyi Gate and sent the surrendered eunuch Du Xun to see the Emperor, seeking abdication. The Emperor was furious and scolded him. He issued an edict for a personal expedition. At dusk, the eunuch Cao Huachun opened Zhangyi Gate, and the rebels all entered. The Emperor left the palace, ascended Coal Hill, and, seeing the beacon fires reaching the sky, sighed and said, 'It is my people who suffer!' He lingered for a long time, returned to Qianqing Palace, ordered the Crown Prince and Prince Yong to be sent to the residences of his relatives Zhou Kui and Tian Hongyu, struck the eldest princess with his sword, and urged the Empress to commit suicide. On the nineteenth, Dingwei, before dawn, the Imperial City was not defended; gongs were sounded to gather the officials, but none came. He then ascended Coal Hill again, wrote his last will on his clothing, and hanged himself from a pavilion on the hill. The Emperor then collapsed."</p>
<p>At this time, the Manchus saw the internal chaos of the Ming Dynasty and took the opportunity to rise up. Before starting the war, they made peace with Korea, and the campaign against Mongolia also achieved considerable results, so they had no worries behind them. Therefore, they advanced south with all their forces. The Manchu's call to take the opportunity to attack the Han originated in "the Ming's closed-door policy cut off the lifeline of Manchu merchants; and officials arbitrarily lowered prices, and tax supervisors arbitrarily imposed harsh levies, causing hatred among Manchu merchants" (Zhou's General History of China). Just as the Manchus were gradually advancing, the father of Wu Sangui, the general of Shanhaiguan, Wu Xiang, was captured by Li Zicheng, who forced him to write to Sangui and persuade him to surrender. It is said that Sangui originally intended to surrender to Li, but later heard that his beloved concubine Chen Yuan (Yuanyuan) was looted by Liu Zongmin, and became so angry that he asked foreign tribes to oppress his own kind. The Ming History, Biography of the Rebel Liuzei, records:</p>
<p>"Zicheng... heard that Wu Sangui, the general of Shanhaiguan, had raised troops, and planned to return to Shaanxi. Initially, Sangui received an edict to enter the defense, and arrived at Shanhaiguan. The capital fell, and he hesitated to advance. Zicheng kidnapped his father Xiang to write a letter to recruit him. Sangui wanted to surrender, but when he reached Yongping, he heard that his beloved concubine Chen Yuan had been looted by Liu Zongmin, and he was very angry. He quickly returned to Shanhai and attacked and defeated the rebel general. Zicheng was furious, led more than 100,000 rebels, held Wu Xiang in the army, and attacked Shanhaiguan in the east, sending another general across the pass at Yipianshi. Sangui was afraid, and begged to surrender to our Great Qing."</p>
<p>The Manchus were suffering from not being able to enter the mainland of China, and Wu Sangui, just to avenge this private grudge, under the slave thought of "rather lose to a foreign tribe than give to a domestic slave", opened Shanhaiguan wide. As a result, the Great Ming Empire and the "domestic slaves" were finished together, allowing the Manchus to rule China for more than two hundred years.</p>
<h3>Nazi Jokes — About Ship Names</h3>
<p>— Bao</p>
<p>It is the custom of the British Navy that the name of every officer should be registered on the ship's register. Since the Naval Aviation Force belongs to the Navy, its officers must also be registered on the ship's register, but some of their land bases are not ships. Therefore, these bases took ship names to accommodate the uniformity of the regulations.</p>
<p>During this war, the British spared no effort in conducting broadcasting duties. Regarding the origin of ship names, the Nazi broadcaster made a joke. HMS Kestrel was originally the name of a British Naval Air Force base. In September 1940, the Nazi radio station broadcasted: "The British magnetic HMS Skyler was bombarded by the German Navy and has sunk." This news became a big joke in the Allied naval circles.</p>
<h3>Premonitions Are Not Mysterious</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Now I want to say that the sixth sense is not some mysterious miracle. Whether the professor who has studied it for seventeen years has used some new theory to absolutely complete the method of premonition.</p>
<p>As far as I know, that premonition is what is called clairvoyance or thousand-star eye Telepathy. People with some knowledge of hypnotism Hypnotism know that it is extremely ordinary. However, there must be a hypnotic subject, given appropriate suggestion Suggestion to make it very easy for laymen to be surprised. We can perceive things that are invisible to the naked eye. It's like sealing something up and having the subject answer on the spot, and he can immediately and accurately tell us. This is the miracle of space, and there is also the miracle of time.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, there are many materials available for research. However, formal Buddhist believers do not pay attention to that kind of supernatural power. We don't have to think that this is a superstitious thing. What a pity is that generally people with a smattering of knowledge think that it is unscientific. Maybe after a few years, we can guess the riddles of space and time.</p>
<h3>Visiting Mei Lanfang (3)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>My idea of visiting Mei was to see the original appearance of this special masterpiece of creation. God created people, and there are masterpieces in all departments of mankind, so there are heroes in the military and political circles, and heroes in the academic world. However, their magic weapons are mostly all in the spirit, not in the body. That is, it is all in the effort of operation, command, painstaking effort, and solitary study, not in the sound and appearance. (So there are often products)) Only the "King of Actors" has his magic fully in the body itself. Beautiful singing and gorgeous postures are all expressed from this clever machine - the body. Isn't this the Creator's "special" masterpiece? Therefore, heroes are not worth visiting, but the King of Actors should be visited to see the original appearance of this ingenious machine after removing the makeup.</p>
<p>One spring afternoon, in a quiet洋樓 (Western-style building), Mr. Mei and I sat face to face on two sofas. As usual, during the greetings, I couldn't believe that this was the King of Actors on stage. Only from the fullness of his eyes, can I vaguely imagine the faces of Yu Ji and Gui Ying. I looked closely at his face and felt that the bones were indeed very well-formed. Looking at his body, it was also just right in terms of height, shortness, fat, and thinness. The Western standard of the human body is the Greek Venus, and there are also plaster models of her circulating in China. I think: according to the standards of human beauty, Mei Lang's figure and appearance are probably close to Venus, and he is qualified to have the Eastern standard human body. He was very happy to talk to me, and his natural voice was loud and sticky. From this, I can also vaguely imagine the tones of "clouds converge on the clear sky, water ripples surge" and "children can't bear to leave their fathers."</p>
<p>From his happy talk, I learned how he painstakingly avoided the occupation period and how he escaped from Hong Kong. It is said that he was able to escape thanks to an officer among the enemy soldiers in Hong Kong who said that his mother had taken him to see Mr. Mei's performance in Tokyo when he was a child, and he had a good impression of him. I also learned that his burden was very heavy, and many opera performers had to be supported by him, and his life was not rich. At this time, his landlord was evicting him, and several gold bars were required to renew the lease. He said to me with emotion, "Where can I get a few gold bars from the money I earn from performing!" I was very surprised why his words touched me so much. After careful study, I realized that he liked to use hand gestures to help him speak; and these gestures were very natural, which ordinary people could not do!</p>
<h3>Beside the Bed</h3>
<p>— Ye Lin</p>
<p>The ancients had a saying to alert us: "How can others be allowed to sleep soundly beside the bed?"</p>
<p>Even sound sleep is not allowed, let alone people being awake and trying to do something. How can we rest easy on our bed?</p>
<p>Looking at recent newspaper reports, the Japanese government sent a letter to MacArthur presenting its views on the peace treaty, requesting preferential immigration rights in Taiwan and requesting civilian control of the Ryukyu Islands and joint management with the United States. This is truly outrageous. A Japanese newspaper also reported that the Japanese ship Daishin Maru invaded our country's territorial waters and was seized by our customs in Weitouao. This is also no ordinary event. As for MacArthur's support for Japanese overseas trade and light industry, and Japanese fishing boats fishing in our country's coastal waters, and the recent influx of Japanese goods into our country under the name of American manufacturing, this series of events makes us feel even more pressure. Militaristic Japan is lurking beside our bed and actively acting. This is worth our vigilance.</p>
<p>In history, it is probably unheard of for a surrendered country to ask the victorious country for the special rights of co-management and immigration. If there is one, Japan should be the first to be mentioned. Here, we see Japan's ambitious attempt to retain its "stepping stone" in the South Pacific. Here, we can also see the shadow of a hundred years of history.</p>
<p>Learning from history, how much we need to be vigilant at all times beside the bed—</p>
<h3>Art and Literature Scene</h3>
<p>The New China Theatre Company's first performance in Shanghai of the seven-act ancient costume historical drama "The Peach Blossom Fan" has been scheduled to officially premiere on the eleventh of this month at the Haiguang Theater, and will host the press and cultural circles on the evening of the tenth. It is said that the play is a new work by Mr. Ou Ciyu, who also serves as the director.</p>
<p>The "Friendship Gathering" organized by the Drama Troupe Association yesterday was unusually crowded with audiences. The day and night programs today will be even more exciting, with performances by famous artists such as Zhou Xuan, Jin Suqin, Jin Suwen, Qin Yi, Ye Zi, Yang Wei, Tian Han, Gu Zhongyi, Li Jianwu, Ying Yunwei, Zhou Bodong, Zhao Dan, Wu Zuguang, and Lü Zhuhong. Before the curtain, Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau will personally deliver a speech.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>With great difficulty, the child was revived within five minutes. But by this time, the engines of the four trucks had begun to roar like tigers. He looked down at Feifei, who was already crying, but her eyes were still not open, and her mind was still confused, so he dared not leave her. After another minute or two, Lü Qian limped over with one leg, panting, and handed a cup of lukewarm boiled water to Lao Zhu, who slowly fed it to Feifei. Unconsciously, another three or four minutes passed.</p>
<p>"Mom! I want Mom...!" Feifei finally opened her eyes and pleaded, shouting loudly.</p>
<p>"Okay, Uncle Zhu will hold you!" Lao Zhu snatched her up from the ground and rushed towards the four trucks that had already started moving.</p>
<p>Lan and Zhang Chang's vehicle was in the second position. By the time Zhu Zhaonian rushed out of the crowd with Feifei in his arms, the third vehicle had already rolled past them. Holding a deeply ominous regret in his heart, Lao Zhu disregarded his life and chased desperately along the road. His rapid panting and Feifei's trembling cries merged into a piercing rhythm that stirred the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Finally, although he勉强managed to catch up with the third vehicle, he could see the tail of the second vehicle. However, Lan was half-lying on the luggage pile, her position was particularly low, and her whole body was正好blocked by a horizontal board at the back of the truck. The exhausted Lao Zhu wanted to run and hold Feifei high, so that she could see her mother again, but he實在was unable to do so. He felt that it was useless to continue chasing, and his pace gradually slowed down.</p>
<p>Zhang Chang, who was standing on the truck, suddenly discovered them and waved his hand wildly.</p>
<p>"Feifei!" Lao Zhu finally stopped, panting, while also forcing a smile, and looked down to explain to Feifei, who was crying incessantly: "We can't catch up! Anyway, we're leaving tomorrow, and we'll see your mother as soon as we get to Hechi."</p>
<p>But Feifei closed her eyes and cried.</p>
<p>The third and fourth vehicles quickly overtook them and drove on, the yellow sand billowed, and soon their shadows disappeared one after another at the corner of the road. Only a faint and intermittent harmonica tune could still be heard blowing in the wind.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian slowly lowered his head, looking at Feifei's face covered with tears, and remained silent, his heart filled with boundless melancholy.</p>
