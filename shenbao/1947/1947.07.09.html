<h3>政院討論動員案　推定數人起草實施綱要　徵糧辦法尚待繼續研商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕全國總動員案，八日提出於政務會議中報告並討論，同時以戰時公布之總動員法提研究，當曾有人主張該項辦法過於富有彈性，應行修改或重新擬訂一辦法，惟另有人認為，根據該項辦法首條所定明者有「抗戰建國」字樣，目前雖非抗戰，但建國則一，故認為不必修改，旋經決定另行召開臨時會議討論，並推定數人草擬實施綱要，內容則着重徵糧、徵兵·刷新地方政治，整理財政及不妨碍行憲之情况並對人民基本自由嚴加保護等數項。</p>

<p>〔本報南京八日電〕政院由王雲五召集之討論總動員案辦法之會議，業己舉行三次，、惟因細節問題太多、一時無法決定，又已付討論者為徵糧辦法，正討論中者為刷刷新地方政治一題。</p>

<p>〔本報南京八日電〕財部某高級官員談：所謂加强經濟管制，即視目前情况酌予恢復戰時諾般措施，同時，在某種環境之下，可以頒布各種臨時法規，至何者亟應恢復，則須待通盤計劃後再決定。</p>

<h3>政院正草擬對月和約　主題為消滅侵路　中蘇關孫須視蘇今後行動為斷</h3>
<p>王寵惠解答國內外局勢　〔本報訊〕記者昨訪府委王寵惠民，詢以國內外局勢，承分別解答　下：（一）政府乏動員剿匪，為當　之舉動。過去政府希望國內問題能和平解決，故不惜一再讓步，即使使用武力，亦為希望以軍事方法達到政治目的。今日形勢巳獎，共黨已明白表示推翻政府之企圖，故政府亦只有全面剿匪之一途。本人認為，全國上下應瞭解此舉實為我國生死之戰，明　是非，社會各界以全力協助政府，則戰亂定可早日結束（二）對日利約問題，戰時己在硏究，目前政院正在草擬，內容以解除武裝，賠償，移民政策等為主題。在我國立塲言，對日和約之最大目的，在消減日本之侵略能力，戰前日本在武力之外，移民，　　無一非　略之先　，凡此種種，均需加以剷除。惟我國不擬採取報復主義，允許日本在經濟上自立與生存，此種立塲，主席己屢有聲明，為我國一貫之仁學作風。（三）在外交上，我國對蘇之立塲不變，　兩國間關係巳趨於明朗化而已。兩國今後關係如何，須視蘇方今後行動以為斷，此時不宜作惡意之預測。兩國人士均應記取，中蘇關係為遠東和平中之最大關鍵，同時，中國抗戰之最大目的，為收復東北，而今日東北之局勢實嚴重萬分。</p>

<p>本團成立迄今，忽已九載，過去抗戰八年來，我全國革命青年，在團長偉大的號召與領導之下，集中革命新生力量，踴躍參加谷項戰時工作，旣已盡其不可磨滅的貢獻，今抗戰雖已獲勝利，而共匪方　擴大全面叛亂，危害國家民族的統一與安全，畫有賴我靑年同志繼續奮鬥之處仍多，團長對我靑年的期望尤切，最近「七七」播講，訓勉諄諄，想我全國靑年均已聆悉，茲當　團九週年紀念，為再申述其義，及其平日的指示，以資共勉</p>
<p>如不戡平叛亂　國家將為斷送</p>
<p>本團誕生之初，即以求達抗戰建國的成功為目的，今共黨既已「匪性難移」，絕無悔禍的誠意，近更變本加厲，不惜出賣祖國，利用韓共日俘，殘殺同胞，其處心積慮，必欲以暴力顛覆國家，貽害世界，已極彰明昭著，我們如不能舉國一致，抱定決心，戡平叛亂，則不獨民生日益凋敝，而整個國家，亦將為其斷送。我政府為鞏固國家統一，保障民族生存，及挽救匪區人民起見，乃出於萬不得已，而頒布動員全國命令，加緊戡亂平逆，即希我全國革命靑年，在團長領導之下，明辨是非，認淸順述，遵守國家法律，實行總動員，共同為救國救民而奮鬥，</p>
<p>封建遺孽腐化　必須同時肅清</p>
<p>第二：我們當前所面對的敵人，除上述共匪的惡化勢力外，尚有封建遺孽等腐化勢力，亦必須同時肅清，而後革命陣容始得整飭。蓋我國革命的進展過程，遵照團長平日的指示，可劃分為前後兩期。在抗戰勝利以前，為前一期的革命，其目的在爭取國家民族的生存，其對象為國外的帝國主義者，與國內的軍閥，而其中心工作，則在實行民族主義，是為軍政時期，自北伐以至抗戰勝利以後，國內軍閥以次剷除、日本帝國主義者亦已打倒，即民族主義可算大體完成，故隨着日本的敗降，結束了前期革命，同時亦展開了後期革命。後期革命的目的，則在建設三民主義的新中國，以保障抗戰的勝利，鞏固國家民族的安全，與維繫世界的和平，其中心工作在實行民權主義與民生主義，是為由訓政過渡到憲政時期，而其對象即為共匪與封建遺孽，此等封建遺孽，投機取巧，操縱物價，擾亂金融，非但加深經濟危機，而且降低政府威信，遂令共匪得以藉口，肆其惡意宣傳，實無異帮助共匪的蔓延，雖共匪到處清算必先他們，但他們如不及早覺悟，則我革命陣營中，亦不能再　其存在，本國過去曾揭　三項工作，應即力求貫澈。</p>
<p>黨國統一改造深切體認團結</p>
<p>第三：本上所述，今日國事旣因共匪的叛亂而日益艱險，而我革命陣營，亦尚有封建遺孽存在其間，團長遠矚高瞻，有見及此，故最近復有明確訓示，必須將黨協和合併，澈底改造，本黨始能統一領導集中力量，以與剿匪國策相配合，凡我同志，務須深切體認此次黨團的統一與改造，乃在適應階段革命的需要，要、亦是黨團新生的良機，絕不可中共匪的分化宣傳，而自失信心，更不可互相猜疑而自亂步伐，必須捐除成見，精誠團結，發楊本黨歷次改組的精神，絕對信仰團長，並服從其命令，以便在團長領導之下，向新生的大道邁進。現在改造方案正由黨團負責同志會同研撥中，在此期間，我各級同志尤應恪遵紀律，竭盡職守，始終如一，勿稍懈怠。</p>
<p>全國革命青年們，青年是革命的先鋒隊，國家的新生命，值此革命的嚴重關頭，正是青年志士効忠報國的良機，即希一致奮起，積極努力，加強勦匪實力，及早掃除赤禍，以完成革命建國的六業。</p>
<h3>我們需要美國貸款嗎？　—衛挺生博士昨晚在滬演講—</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市力行聯誼社昨晚八時在中國銀行四樓舉行第二次學術演講，請立法委員衞挺生博士演講「我們需要美國貸款嗎」？衛氏係著名經濟專家，渠認為對於借款之藝本態度應為：借款當然歡迎，但問題仍須由自己主動解決，不可依賴他國。換言之，如美國肯帮忙，問題可以解決得快些，如不肯帮忙，問題還是必須解決。渠分析所謂問題有兩部份，一為救急，即如何渡過難關，一為建國，即如何進行建設。先談建國，非但需要外國借款，且更應以各種方法儘量吸收國外大規模投資，利用人家高度發展之技術與優秀之人材助我建設。譬諸捕魚，是為用他人之網捕我們的魚，如拒絕借款、眞是傻子。至於救急，無庸諱言者，通貨膨漲已至非常危險的地步，過去兩年，誠可謂歷史上不幸的兩年。今日一切財政，金融，經濟，政治問題之癥結，全由於收支不能平衡所致，但時至今日，即使無美國貸款，問題亦未始不能解決。衞氏曾奉蔣主席召面把意見，並數度與張羣院長面談，渠認為古衡收支之道在於（一）整頓稅收，添闢新稅源，有人認為在此民生凋敝之時不應再言增稅”但渠則認為譬如治病，汗仍應出自病人身上。（二）出售國家資產，將接收所得及不必要之國營事業儘量　與民營，○變更外匯及金融政策，取消外匯統制，匯率隨物價自動調整，以鼓勵出口，增加生產並吸收比期存款。而最付效之濟急之策，則為（四）培養財政信用，發行短期公債，以吸收遊資。蓋現時人民握有遊資者為數極鉅、所苦者投資無路，政府如能給以厚利，昭以大信，人民必樂於購買，依此原則實行，如技術上無問題，則財政收支必可達到平衡。最後，衛氏並推究美國所以遲遲不肯貨款之故，乃由於中國局勢未能澄淸，蓋美人須在兩種情形下始肯幫助中國，或則共產黨與政府合作，或則將共產黨肅淸，兩年來事實證明，共產黨係一滅絕人性之黨，僅為某一民族帝國主義之工具，其目的完全在於傾覆中華民國，故政府惟有出諸戡亂之途。在此艱難困苦之時，全國人民決不可袖手旁觀，把重任寄之於蔣主席一人，而必須支持政府，以事實表現，踴躍認購公債，以改善國家之狀况，如此則外援亦必接　而至。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日電〕本星期三四可望抵此之美駐華大使館公使白德華，係應馬歇爾之請返國，以備諮詢者，白氏適於此時返華府，其使命之重要性，已因我國政府最近之決定全面戰亂而益增高。靈通方面相信，白氏此行，未必即表示美國之對華政策將有任何激烈之改變，白氏抵此後，將立即向馬歇爾報告一切靈通方面訊　，關於白氏離華前，與行政院長張羣及宋子文氏會晤情形，紐約時報雖已刋載，但國務院迄未接獲任何正式報告，其他方面人士謂，白氏之返華府，頗為以時，因自馬歇爾今年一月返美以來，美國之高級人員，向　直接報告者，以白氏為第一人。</p>
<p>馬卿注視中國問題</p>
<p>白德華今明日可抵華盛頓</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕國務卿馬歇爾七日轉移注意力於中國問題，曾與中國行政院政務委員李大明（民社黨常委）會談，李氏自檀香山到此，會後據官方稱：兩人曾討論中國當前各種問題。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕　進出口銀行某代表稱：中國政府已要求進出口銀行給予貨款，用諸各種復興工作，如建築港口與鐵路，發展化學，開礦及肥料工業等，惟中國政府並未提出貸款之數額，此為中國在十四個月來之第一次申請貸款，進出口銀行將就中國政府之計劃，縝密加以研究。</p>

<h3>日戰犯磯谷受審　庭訊各點着重在港罪行　昨未審比今續開辯論庭</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕日戰犯磯谷辦介，八日晨在首部勵志社大禮堂國防部之臨時審判戰犯法庭公開受審。機谷為日戰犯中受審之第三人，其犯罪地點着重於香港，犯罪行為除縱容部下燒殺姦淫外，並在港寳施寗化政策。上午審至十二時退庭，午後續審，仍未訊畢，定今日繼續開辯論庭。</p>
<h3>縱容部下姦殺　雖圖狡賴但無事實作反證</h3>
<p>機谷身材較酒幷隆及谷壽夫兩魔為高，着軍便　，入法庭時，手持咖啡色呢帽一頂，並挾內藏文件之布包一個，神色極為鎭定。九時正，庭長石美瑜曁檢察官書記，官行升庭。首由石庭畏提詢其姓名，籍貫，年齡。據答：係日本東京人、年六十四歲，住東京世谷區，曾任第十師團長，香港總督，關東軍參謀長等職。旋由檢察官宣讀起訴書，並由翻譯官譯成日語，磯谷凝神靜聽。</p>
<p>九時三刻，起訴書宣讀完畢，石庭長宣稱；適檢蔡官依據被吿（一）違反和平罪，（二）戰爭罪，（三）違反人這罪起訴。渠繼乃詢問被吿於陸大畢業後之職務。磯谷答以曾任參謀本部部附，敎育總監部及陸車省科長，其問於大正六年出任參謀，後在上海兩年，大正九年至十二　，在廣島任大隊長，自大正十四年至昭和四年、共做聯隊長七年，後調日陸軍省人專科長等職。以土各職，與中日作戰均無　，僅昭和十年至十一年，在滬　大僅館任武官，致趕關東軍驂謀　，後太平洋戰爭專發，香港戰題　即被在命為香港　磯谷答畢，看庭長即訊問關車軍之任務及七七事變時，被吿任何職等。職谷稱：關東軍任防衛「滿洲國」之責，並非圖以造成「滿洲國家」者。七七開始時，任第十師團長，當年八月底，在大沽登陸，九月底，以全力沿津浦綫南下，十二月底即至兗州。　至此，石庭長即宣佈其罪非狀，為：山東泰安縣機谷部下姦淫屠殺，河南孟縣之搶刧屠殺，博愛縣之搶刧等等，同時提出輪姦女人致死證件。磯谷即全部予以狡賴不承認，而不以事實作反證且將時問如「一九三七年」「民國廿六年」「昭和一年」等故意攪錯，並稱：被告係啣命來華作戰，全為受命行事，決無不法事件。</p>
<p>訊至此，戰爭罪部份偵査完畢，繼即為毒化香港部份，磯谷在港，自昭和十七年開始，至十九年十二月卸任，其對毒化部份，禁毒及公資並行部份，强辯稱。係採用「漸减法」，以台灣十年禁絕先例行之。同時提小笠原靑作證，小笠原青僅稱鴉片分配於東亞者共五百萬兩，並未對港單獨分配，同時亦係使其能全部禁止之法，全詞狡辯抺煞事實。時已十二時，即退庭，午後續審。</p>
<h3>在港放逐平民　偵查庭中已承認昨又翻供</h3>
<p>下午四時四十五分繼續開庭，訊問各點均側童被吿在港各項罪行。庭上首訊磯谷：港憲兵隊長野間賢助旣係被告下屬，且常赴總督府報吿工作情形，則施行酷刑曁非法逮捕平民當所知曉。磯谷答辯稱。完全不知，憲兵隊長非總督府內人物，非遇有車要事務亦無直接報吿必要，且每月報吿亦祗一次，甚至二月一次，故所作非法行為，本人完全不知。庭上即駁斥稱：汝身為長官，都下犯罪自當負責。幷提出東南亞盟軍總部調査組所提被施酷刑卅八人確證。被吿閱覽後，辯稱：此類不法行為，應由擔任此種職務之人負責，本人在總督任內，確當嚴禁下屬為非作惡，此類非法行為，委實在任時未有所聞，否則自當嚴辦，自問對防止北類行為，已盡全責。庭上訊以可提出已盡責之確證否？磯谷稱：不在身邊，但可向東京方面提取。</p>
<p>庭上復訊以在港流放平民一事，被吿在偵査庭中已加承認，惟執行命令時，究用口頭抑用書面？機谷辯稱：過去並未加以承認，放逐平民並無此事，僅為保障大多數人民秩序起見，曾放逐三次罪民，呈奉上峯核准後口頭命令民食部及憲兵隊執行，庭上遂出示四月廿一日偵査庭筆錄謂已承認翁放逐平民事，並以總督名議發出命令，何又否認？被吿又狡辯謂係記錄錯誤，本人並未承認過。庭上乃稱：偵査庭中曾供稱因香港糧食缺乏．故出此策，今何又自相矛盾？被吿辯稱：此為疏做自願還鄉之四十萬人人民，逐放與疏散不能一槪而論。庭上又訊：據報；大鵬灣當時有被放逐者達四十萬人之多，確否？被吿至此，竟失笑稱：絕對無此巨數，當時放逐罪民祗四批，以船隻載送，每船約五百人四次約計祗二千人左右，所謂四十萬人，恐係指疏散之人民而言。庭上乃出示英人歐門司所提確證謂：民國三十年六月至十二月間、大鵬灣每月死亡被放逐之良民多至五百人至七百人。被吿要求說明該人之身份後，又狡辯稱：此證絕不可靠，庭上又示以華籍代表羅旭和及其他九人之證據，謂曾面見港督抗議放逐平民未准。被吿又辯稱：飴終未見及此等代表。並大放厥詞，謂：奉派赴港任總督時，即有尊重中國禮敎之信念，故到港後，即竭力尊重華人意見，曾遭國內人士竭力反對。時間已屆七時，被告仍曉曉欲辯，庭諭改九日續開辯論庭，屆時可再提出聲辯。乃退庭。</p>

<h3>外部公祭楊光泩等烈士　王外長痛述日蔑視人道</h3>

<p>主外長于公祭被，就楊氏等殉難事，發表談話如下：楊總領事光泩籌九人，為當時中華民國駐外之使人，當時中日雖為敵國，然殺害敵國使者固為古今中外之習慣所不許，日人對於我服務國外之使人，竟加殺害，實為近世文明之一大恥辱。日本軍人在匪律賓中國及其他地區負有破壞國際法與人道主義之重責者，現已陸續受顯戮，或受國際審判，此種制裁，應可為蔑視人道與法律者之烱戒，而稍慰楊總領事諸烈士之忠魂。</p>

<p>首先，我們要認淸：為什麼抗日戰爭勝利了幾及兩年，而遝要實行總動員？無非是為了中國共產黨拒絕和平，逞兵作亂，破壞建設，斷送國脈，把勝利之果，毫不容情的斵傷了，斷送了，說來就無限感慨！政府兩年來一再容忍，委曲求全，適足以造成共產黨人夜郎自大，得寸進尺的機會，遂致遍地烽火，滿目瘡痍，較之抗戰期間幾有過之。由於兩年來的事實敎訓，政府所採的政策，心地是好的，辦法是錯了，結果是徒然貽誤了國家！我們放眼瞭望東北西北的一連串的禍患，隱然可以窺見將來演變的結局，我們身為中國人，能不放聲慟哭！</p>
<p>共產黨人的殘酷好戰，所謂「解放區」裏的民主眞相如何，就述向來對共黨頗存恕道的大公報，昨天也在「民主與民衆團體」的一篇文字裏盡情描寫出來了。時至今日，我們相信無論各黨各派無黨無派人士，只要基於愛護國家的心理而持無條件的和平論調者，如能認淸事實眞相，必能判明誰是眞求和平，誰是以和平作幌子了。現在國民政府旣已懍於兩年來委曲求全而不可得，今後為確實盡其拯救戰區人民挽回垂危國運的責任計，才決定發動全民的力量，克服當前的種種困難，早日戡平叛亂，重奠國家建設的基礎，則可知此日的總動員實在是事到臨頭萬不得已的舉措。</p>
<p>蔣主席所說的，「今日之袖手旁觀，卽他日之束手待斃」，眞是千眞萬確！</p>
<p>我們旣知「總動員」是萬不得已，而所謂「總動員」者，無非政府要求人民各自堅守崗位，嚴肅起來，遵守動員法令，貢獻則力物力。那末這些政府對於人民的要求，也就是人民對於國家應有的義務。惟有政府號召人民力量，人民饗應政府要求，方可形成强有力的有機體，戡亂建國，自能達成目的。可是目前社會風尙的奢浮，一般入民的浪費，實在是江河日下，令人觸目驚心！一席之費，竟達千萬，還成什麼話說！而究極說來，我們眼看戰敗的日本一天一天的追趕上去，一面又看到各地遭受天災人禍的同胞在過水深火熱的生活，難道還忍心嬉遊浪費，毫不警覺，眞做危幕之下的燕雀嗎？</p>
<p>再次，我們要特別喚起各級政府當局的警覺！毋庸諱言的，一般人民是反對共產主義的，尤其是痛惡共黨匪軍的，然而他們未必就完全信仰政府的政令，這是最値得注意的。政府如果得不到人民的支持與擁護，還那裏能確實做到總動員？在以往，政府在公文上，說得頭頭是道，却辦得馬馬虎虎，法令章則，轉瞬成為具文，究其癥結，由於當事者缺乏自信心責任感與任勞任怨的精神，推諉，延宕，因循，苟且種種腐敗現象，使人民看在眼裏，何從能有威信？謹愿者奉行故事，辦事毫無效率，狡點者假公濟私，違法舞弊，又往往視同家常便飯。於是立法原意縱是便民利國，而行法的結果竟變成了誤國殃民。此非立法之過，乃執法之罪！這種風氣，在歷史上原與國家盛衰互為消長，故於時局紛亂之際、惡例尤多。此次政府正在擬訂配合總動員案的種種法令，事先務必設身處地，權衡輕重，博訪周諮，妥為擬訂，先使法令本身絕對健全，將來執行機關更無假藉餘地，而各級負執行責任的員司，尤須面對現實，澈底認識動員法令關係國家生存之重要性，嚴自整肅，盡力執行，勿再蹈抗戰期間總動員大抵有名無實的覆轍。所最當重視的，對於執行不力者，固須懲戒，對於假藉動員法令，而有擾民舞弊者，尤須處以最嚴厲之罪刑。須知國家之敗，由於官邪，官方不肅，一切無從談起。治亂世，用重典，諸葛武侯與張江陵的政績，大可為今日當道的圭臬。我們回想過去所謂一發國難財，勝利財，接收財，復員財一者，雖人言鑿鑿，可是到底有幾個辦了重罪？雷聲大雨點小，若干犯法者，也許還要翹起大姆指，誇口得意，向檢舉的人作報復性的譏嘲。這樣的結果，不僅政府自隳其威信，抑且無形中鼓勵了壞人作惡。社會上壞人愈抬頭，好人將愈末落，而可好可壞的人則漸漸流入壞人羣中，道德墜落，競驚私利，又何從「總動員」得起來？古語云：「法之不行，自上犯之。」今後要頒訂許多配合總動員的法令，我們特鄭重提出，謂政府先注意執行法令的機關與人員，務必公正嚴明，絲毫不苟，否則「壞蛋」將拾來了蒼蠅，假藉法令營私舞弊的結果，勢必使國脈民命所關的總動員落了一個空，勦匪軍事也將因此而不能迅速結束。</p>
<p>最後，目前中國大局，誠如張院長所言，「全國人民必須有一根本認識，這是中國建設力量與破壞力最之爭。」除了軍事上的戡亂以外，尤有政治戰和經濟戰。但政治和經濟根本不可分割，經濟上好的決策，，必有賴於修明的政治環境，尤須有淸廉的行政官吏去實施，才能收預期的效果。因為經濟的措施，在在與財帛發生關係，很容易誘引貪墨者的饞涎，所以在經濟動員和經濟戰中，更應以肅淸貧汚為第一義！</p>
<h3>愼防「饒餓出口」！</h3>
<p>日本對外貿易自下月中旬起卽可開放，日人不僅已在積極籌備之中，而且最近忽又叫出了一個「饑餓出口」的口號，企圖重返南洋奪取市塲：日人的野心昭然老揭，不僅足以證明我國反對開放日本對外貿易為正當，而且也可以視為英美商品在南洋市塲王又將遭遇一個勁敵的預兆。</p>
<p>日本以饑餓為口號，似乎容易博得各國的同情心；但是各國人士的眼睛都是雪亮的，日人企圖以一手掩盡天下的耳目，遲早終不免歸於失敗的。假如今日之日本人民，果眞都在饑餓綫上掙扎，中國向來寬大為懷，與人為善，決不會反對開放日本對外貿易，而不讓日本覓取一條生路的；但是戰後的日本究底是怎樣的情形，凡在日本的人士，都看得非常淸楚，所謂有自共睹，我們已看到了許多外國記者的忠實報導，自不待言：何况一切有關日本人民生活及秩序的措置，還要預防日本侵略勢力的捲土重來呢！</p>
<p>連日以來，從東京傳來了不少向中國挑釁的新聞，使我們不得不提高警覺，所謂杜微防漸，不可不早謀對策。澳洲因為不滿美國的對日政策，伊瓦特外長已決定於本月杪赴東京一行，俾親自與麥帥會商對日和約問題；我國無論如何，終是遠東的大國，不僅是對日利害關係最深的國家，而且也是決定速凍安危的因素之一；不論為遠東和平計，抑或為本身的安全計，此時實在應該說話，明白表示自己的立塲了！</p>

<h3>蘇與西方國家間　正醖釀嚴重局勢　在下一家理想礙難實現　美左票份子對蘇聨行動深感困惑</h3>
<p>〔聨合社成功湖七日電〕蘇聨與西方國家仍對馬歇爾計劃之分裂可望於兩星期內演成爆發性的局勢，此種局勢在聨合主要經濟機關中醖已多月。聨合國經濟社會理　會夏季會議將於本月十九日在此開幕，同時聨合國歐洲經濟濟委員會現在日內瓦開會，衝突均可隣時爆發。此外尚有下列各種數重乏巨乳：（一）聞蘇聨或將拒絕參加本月十日在此開幕之聨合國遠束經濟委員會會議。（二）蘇聯拒絕參加九日在巴黎開幕之聯合國小來會議。（三）蘇聯不再出席現在日內瓦舉行之國際貿易會議。（四）南斯拉夫今日已退出國際勞工局。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕美國外交家預測秋問召開聯合國大會以及此後將舉行之四國外長會議，恐將成為聯利後同盟關係陷於長期破製之開端，並認為各大國之改變現行政策，亦極少可能，「天下一家」之理論，實可謂為已將死亡，故各大國在秋問聞會時，應尋覓「兩個世界」同存之途徑，俾可對和平作合理之保障。各外交家對於均勢之動搖及東西雙方政治與經濟競爭日趨激烈之情形，咸引為一種極大危機，尤以蘇聯之拒絕馬歇爾計劃，似已使四强破裂之情形，益為明顯，故彼等多以為若右能放棄「夫下一家」之幻想，訓着勢力施兩，或反可易於處理世界局勢云。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日電〕此間觀察認為蘇聨拒絕在馬歇耳計劃下合作，致將歐洲分裂為兩半，若美國親蘇份子欲為蘇方行動，尋找方更之藉口時，將有極大困難，因事實上蘇聨已明白表示該國除依照其自身條件外，不欲在任何　礎上，建設歐洲。此事使美國之左傾份子與自由人士，左右為難。美國左翼「下午」報，可為一例。該報索來親蘇，今日社評，乃指黃蘇聨賭博性之舉動，似乎輕認狂動，不負責任，此舉似為蘇方故意之行為，俾使世界淪入混亂養態之中，使共產主義乘機自混亂中坐收漁利，不論其動機與結果如何。總之，蘇聯不能逃避其分裂歐洲與護主議戰爭之重大責任。兩個世界，即美蘇兩國，能否共存，端賴兩項先決條件：（一）美國應以充分與無限制之物質，援助若于國家，並提高其生活水準，食糧，安全，工作為抵抗共產主義與不穏局面　佳之武哭。（二）協助西歐之中立，使其強大足為堅強緩衝地帶。吾人欲指出者，即美國左翼份子，自由八十對馬卿計劃，頗加贊同，華萊士即為一例。美車左蠶份子旣份為三派，即左翼之右派，中央派與極端左派，此類所謂自由份子之反噢，頗堪注意。</p>
<h3>聨合國歐經會議席上　蘇代表抨擊英法　蘇參加歐洲經濟合作希望益微</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社日內瓦七日電〕聨合國歐洲經濟委員會本日舉行會議時，蘇聨代表猛烈抨　英法兩國，英法代表亦反唇根據，舌戰頗為激烈。蘇聨代表左林指斥英法兩國互相勾結，反對蘇聯、據稱：英法兩國會在蘇聯之背後暗中籌備巴黎三國外長會議，英國外相貝文在巴黎三國外長會　舉行之前，何故先與法國外長皮杜爾舉行磋商，殊難索解。英法兩國意欲在聯合國機構之外設立一組織，蘇聯對於此種組織，碍　接　，蓋因此種組織將侵犯歐洲小國之主權故也。蘇聯決不同意歐洲各國陷入美國之經濟控制。</p>
<p>英代表即國務大臣麥克尼可起立三言，對於蘇聨代表指斥各節，有所駁　，路謂：蘇聯代表指斥英國在蘇蘇政蔣之背後暗中行事，此種論調　毫無一事實根據。敢問貝文外組欲與外國官員，如法國外長是杜爾及美國國務院帮辦克萊頓　談話時，事先是否有取得蘇聯准許之必要。貝文外相與皮社爾外　所舉行之會談，並無一任何「邪惡」之處。蘇聯代表發表此種空無所有之演說，未免浪費歐洲經濟委會之時間。奈與蘇聯代表同樣深知歐洲之分裂係極火之危險，歐洲並未可以優然奕棋之棋盤，而為無數備受飢餓痛苦之男女人民云。法國代表即該國國民經濟部長斐里浦繼起答覆蘇聯之指斥，略謂：蘇聯人動輒誇張一切事情，此畫為危險之習憒。蘇聯代表暗示蘇聯政府認為英法兩國互相勾結以反對蘇聯，余對於此種論調不得不表示抗議，須知馬歇爾援歐計劃乃為「歷史上之新紀元」深望望各國均能在自由之條件下，協助歐洲之複興云。歐洲經濟十委員旋助散會，定明晨十一時再行會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎七日電〕英法現尙未放棄蘇聯參與歐洲復興會議之希望，但鑒於蘇聯代表佐林今日在日內瓦聯合國歐洲經濟委員會會議中對英美之攻擊，可見此種希望甚微。</p>
<h3>捷讠蘇代表團　啟程赴蘇京</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社捷克京城七日電〕捷克斯洛伐克總理戈特華特所率領之代表　，將於明日啓程前往莫斯科，與蘇聯政治家惟行會談，討論巴黎三國經濟會議失敗後之局勢。代表人員中，捷克外長馬薩克與司法部長奧蒂那亦在其內。據消息靈通人士稱：此行亦與捷克斯洛伐克接受英法之邀參加巴黎會議討論馬歇爾計劃一事有關云。</p>
<h3>蘇聨報紙電臺　指責英外相</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科七日電〕蘇聯報紙及電台今日廣播塔斯社倫敦電指責英外長貝文奉華盛頓令，企圖利用馬歇爾援歐計劃，分裂歐洲為兩大陣綫。此種行動並已獲得法外長皮杜爾無條件支援。美國以援助方式為餌，刺激英法若干領袖之服從心。但在大體上若輩對於巴黎會議並不特別歡迎，且已預料其失敗。貝文受蘇聯報紙攻擊，此為最激烈之一次。</p>
<h3>克萊頓抵巴黎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：美副國務卿克萊頓，週二自日內瓦飛抵巴黎，預料克氏將在巴黎勾留二三日，與法國最高當局有所商談，但將於週六馬歇爾援歐計劃會議調幕以前離云賭錢論如何濯不出席該會議。</p>
<h3>美土兩國簽訂　信用借款協定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社土耳其京城七日電〕土耳其外長匯卡與美代表團領袖，將於明日在此間簽訂一億美元之信用借款協定，用以擊頓土耳其之陸軍與經濟。但該約在八月廿五日召開土國民大會之前，尚不致呈請國會批准。</p>
<h3>討論馬卿歐洲復興計劃　十二圖接受邀請　東歐諸國態度頗下一致</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教八日廣播：奧內閣已接受巴黎會議之邀請。又瑞士聯邦會議亦正式接受該項謹請，惟附有若干條件。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕目前已接受邀請者為愛，義，葡，希，土，比，荷，盧，捷與冰島等十國。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎八日廣播：蘇聯勢力範圍內之若干國家，已決定參加巴黎會議，討論馬歇爾復興歐洲之計劃。據捷克方面來訊：蘇聯現甚有再度攷慮參加之意。保加利亞發言人謂：保國或將參加。至於南斯拉夫雖已由莫斯科電台宣佈不參加，但據悉狄托對於馬歇爾計劃甚感興趣，亦有參加可能。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎八日電〕與蘇聯有密切關係各國，對於是否參加巴黎會議，討論馬歇爾援歐計劃一事，今日已形分裂。傳羅馬尼亞，波蘭與南斯拉夫擬不參加本星期六在巴黎舉行之會議，捷克則已決定贊成參加。</p>
<p>據莫斯科廣播塔斯社消息稱：羅馬尼亞，波蘭及南斯拉夫將不參加巴黎會議。羅京來電，政府已決定不加人。波蘭與南斯拉夫雖樂于接受美國放款，但寗與債權人發生直接關係，而不願由人居間。捷克京城半官方面則稱，捷克政府已決定授權駐法大使諾斯克，參加巴黎會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕芬蘭內閣已由四買二表決拒絕參加。</p>
<p>〔路透一社倫敦八日電）英國報紙對捷克之接受英法邀請，願意出席巴黎會議，表示驚異而愉央。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦七日電〕布達佩斯訊：政府發言人稱，匈牙利已定七日下午召開特別內閣會議，討論匈牙利參加巴黎會議與否之問題。據靈通方面訊，匈牙利小地主黨及社會民主黨正在使用壓力，欲使政府接受英法之邀請，但共產黨測表示反對。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎七日電〕表六利共產黨贊成參加巴黎會議，但提出條件多端，預料蘇聯勢力範園內各國亦將奉為主果、相繼效尤。</p>
<h3>土耳其醖釀政潮</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社安哥拉八日電〕負責人士今日稱：土耳其內部發生嚴軍政爭或將導致貝克總理及早辭職。總理與副總理歐克門已匆匆自伊斯坦埠返京，與伊諾努總統商談。聞貝克與總統及民主黨領袖巴耶對立、巴耶指責現內閣為恐佈內閣，有反動傾向，不能使土耳其造成民主。</p>
<h3>英政府府宣布成立　經濟設計委員卻　提供意見解決當前困難</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕樞密院大臣莫理遜今日在下院宣布新成立英國經濟設計委員會之組織及任務。該會之主要任務，在向政府提供關於使用經濟資源，以解決當前困難，並實行遠期計劃之意見，該會主席奴普洛登爵士，渠個人有時亦將主持經濟設計委員會之任務。委員當遴選工業界勞資變方經騐豐富之人担任，其常任秘書當由主管貿易及工業之政府三部選派。經濟設計委員會設立以後，政府與工業之間，可以從事更密任切之合作並交換意見。</p>
<h3>美德統仲請國會　通過移民入境案　收容流亡人民為美國職責所在</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統今日咨文國會，促其儘速行動，以通過准許訂重要數額之歐洲流亡人民進入美國之立法案。總統並未述及任何特定數額，亦未述及前此已向國會提出而殊鮮發展之各移民法案。但渠强調聲明，此等流亡人民若聽其無定期居留難民營中，殊屬不可想像。總統力言切不可驅使此等難民進進入德國，使與曾經對其屠殺之人民共處。且德國之經濟已受戰爭之破壞，再加各鄰邦之德人紛紛返德，人口過於擁擁據，已陷入經濟窒息之地步。美國政府堅決反對强迫流亡人民歸返原來國家，世界今均矚且美國俾知、美國是否亦能履行其諾言，以准許流亡入民至美。美國之會同其他國家協助此等不幸人民，乃其職責所在。杜魯門申總統並指出現存之移民入境限額，殊嫌不當，故必須通過時別立法，以准許歐洲流亡人民之大量移入。</p>
<h3>貝文擬親自出席　巴黎會議開幕式　各國顯欲儘量避免牽涉政治</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕今日宣佈，貝文外相擬赴巴黎，至少將參加巴黎會議之開幕式，此訊使各方面對於巴黎會議，益增興趣。迄至目前為止，猶不知巴黎會談將為外交性仰按術性之會談。各與會國將派外交部長抑經濟專家出席。貝文雖　赴巴黎，然各方仍料此次會議將儘量使其减少政治性而保持嚴格之經濟性。瑞士·瑞典·挪威，丹麥等國如果決定參加，顯然願意儘量避免政治之牽涉。</p>
<p>關於會務之發展，若合作委員會——綜合委員會得於五月十五日成立，則料四小組委員會可立即開始收集情報之工作，使合作委員會得以根據此項情　而編製最後報吿書。據悉：關於各主要事務之報吿，自會議初期即將　往巴黎，可知英法兩國不欲浪費片刻時間以開始進行工作。合作委員會之組織，英法主張由英法代表會同荷·比·盧森堡之代表一人，斯坎的那維亞諸國代表一人，東歐代表一人，可能再加義大利代表一人組成。小組會之委員，人數大約與此相同。但無論如何不致超過十人。巴黎會議開幕後之第一件工作，當然即為選舉委員。至於巴黎會議之是否得以保持嚴格之經濟性而不牽涉政治，當視下列二問題而定：（一）除捷克外之東歐國家是否將應邀來巴黎出席；（二）果爾，彼在同意參加各委員會之工作前·是否將提出政治要求。</p>
<h3>貝文暢論　歐洲臺作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：英外相貝文今日表示等候蘇聯參加馬歡漸復興歐洲計劃之門戶，依然廻開。據謂：「馬歇爾計劃對於歐洲各民族之　結¥將有空前偉大之貢獻。目前歐洲正在流血，必須予以阻止。英國對於任何願意合作者、均予以合作。同時對於不願合作者，仍對之開放門戶，俾其終有一日能合作也」。</p>
<h3>最後消息</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山八日寗播：美國今日又採取另一行動，援助希臘，美駐　大使麥克維今與希總理在雅典簽訂協定，規定由美方以價値五千萬美元之救濟品運希應用。</p>
<h3>西班牙公民投票　英法不重視　弗朗哥赴南部觀察</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫數七日電〕關於西班牙舉行公民投票，表決新王位繼任法一事，頃據英國外務部發言人稱，英國對於此事不甚重視。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕關於西班牙舉行公民投票表決新王位　任法一事，倫敦表示其反應後·法政府人士頃亦予以響應，認為無關緊要。略謂，不問其投票結果如何，實皆不能證明西班牙人民之買成或反　，亦不能視為弗朗哥有代表西班牙人民發言之權。總之，弗朗哥之西班牙幷不能因投票勝利而獲改變其國際地位。外國對之當亦不致因此而</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社馬德里八日電〕弗朗哥今晨飛往西班牙南部之馬拉加省，觀察家認為些行與弗朗哥考察西屬摩洛哥一項傳說有關。</p>
<h3>安一會討論巴爾幹問題　聨合國面臨危機　監察希北境案將引起激烈爭辯</h3>
<p>〔聨合社成功湖八日電〕蘇聨轉已準備於今日發表重要聲明，答覆美英兩國要求聨合國對巴爾幹緊急局勢採取行動，以恢復秩序一事。安全理事會各國代表成準備全日討論此事，及其也各項問題，認為國歷史上最　重之時問已將屆臨。</p>
<p>今日之大問題，即在蘇聨代表葛羅米柯、是否將運用否決權，以阻撓美國所提議之聯合國監察希臘北部邊境案。英代表賈德幹曾宣稱，安理會若不能解決巴爾幹問題，則聯合國機精不如束裝解散。美代表奧斯汀亦同樣堅持安理會必須採取某種行動，並於必要時使用武力。觀於英美代表之立塲，蘇聯若運用否決權，勢有引起聯合國　構空前重大危機。葛羅米柯之聲明，性質秘不宣佈，但據基同事透露，葛氏將以俄語發言。近數月來，葛氏遇有重要聲明輟用俄語。預料葛氏將代阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞及南斯拉夫三附　國辯護，否認巴爾幹之紛擾，大部份應由三國負責，殆無疑問，並將對希臘作有力之攻擊。今日議程上此外尙有兩項問題：一為表決聯合國委員會所提出之戰軍執行方案，二為討論阿爾巴尼亞，外蒙古，葡萄牙，愛爾蘭及外約丹五國車行申請入會問題。</p>
<p>安理會通過　美裁軍計劃</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：安全理事會　日不顧蘇聯之反對，通　美國芝裁軍計劃。票數為九對一，蘇聨未投票。但蘇代表葛羅米柯提出警吿，謂安理會此舉將使一切縮軍努力、歸於崩潰。又波蘭今日亦未投票。</p>
<h3>猶太流亡政府　傳已組織完成</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗勞倫斯八日電〕本社日接近義境猶太抵抗運動之消息靈通方面探悉，組織臨時猶太流亡政府之工作幾已完全吿成。據此間」猶太抵抗運動報之編輯吿本社稱，流亡政府人貫將由冬天車自由巴斯斯坦同盟。法國猶太國民委會。義大　猶太國民委會等團體中遴選。該報前　猶太臨時　　之　報。政府人員之姓名以及各猶太國民　體之名稱，在適當時期因要嚴守秘密。伊爾根黨將為臨時政府之軍事部隊，其性質不亞於其他各國政府之國軍。臨時政府將為民主政府，並不依附國際共　主義，故於發生新）世界戰時，將參加民主國家之陣容。臨時政府極與與各民主國家成立協議，並盡力解決懸題，伊　　黨人數然十一萬人，正與英人作戰中，目前將保持秘密性。</p>
<h3>蘇聨代表同意討論　原國能限額制度　堅持原子武器應予予以銷毀</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖七日電〕關於世界原子能之「限額制度」，以確定各國之原子能生產量，設備及原子燃斜一嚴，今日原子能委員會開會時，蘇戰代表葛洛米哥已表示願意參加，並謂，蘇聯認為必須設立一種制度，然後始能對原子能作有效之管制。按此一限額建議，係法國於六月十九日所提出，主張世界原子管制機構，應根據世界原子管制條約之特別規定，負責分配各國之原子能物資。</p>
<p>〔聯合成功湖七日電〕聯合國原子能委員會起草小組今日開會時，叙利亞代表柯萊提議，由安理曾保管原子炸彈，以備將來一國際警備軍之用。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯率先反對，謂除非立即毀滅原子彈，任何提議均違背聨合國大會從前之決議，碍難接受，聯大決議規定禁止原子武器絕無保留，此際為時已晚，吾人不容違反此稱決議。中英澳加與巴西代表大抵與葛氏意見一致，主張在國內或國際禁用一切原子武器。法美兩國代表認為此一問題應繼續討論。此議現已任命一四國小組委會，負賣將蘇聯建議擬成方案。此外，該會尙通過一項決議，主張所擬組織之國際軍隊、雜持世界和平，亦不應有原子能武器之配備。</p>

<h3>對限制棧單交易　倉庫業表示意見　規定期限出貨　勢將影響營業　社局將徵紗糖等業意見</h3>

<h3>商聨五地理監事　談商務民生情況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕商聯會理監事，來自全國各地，記者以時間關係，未及遍訪。僅與天津湖北廣東寗夏等五處之姬奠川等交談，順詢各地之商務近况及民生疾苦，茲將要點分誌如下：</p>
<p>津糧荒嚴重</p>
<p>天津商會理事長姬奠川：北奠川：北方糧食缺乏，河北大米售至六千元一斤。現東北之糧食已不能接濟，海運食糧則糧食部管制太嚴，商賈望而却步。故唯有自由運輸，方可抑平華北之糧價。共區封鎖甚嚴，糧價低於自由區，將來糧食運至北方後，不致流入共區。平津市面蕭條，主因為平漢津浦阻塞之故，日用品售價較之上　為低，市民購買力之薄弱，實有　　之。市民希望行總救濟物資北運數量能提高。華北經濟之復興，非一單純問題，實有賴於軍事政治局面之開展。農村因共黨抽丁，失耕現象嚴重，因早災關係，秋收無望，政府如不能有計劃接濟，八九月間將有嚴重糧荒。</p>
<p>鄂棉花豐收</p>
<p>湖北商會李薦廷：武漢戰時備受敵人之摧殘，勝利後二年以來，因大局關係，工商業不但不能恢復戰時之損失，且均岌岌不可終日。工業界最大之困難，為物價漲勢太速，難於再生產。以物價而論，約為上海之一半，白米現售二十三萬一担。今年湖北棉花之收成，較　　　　，品質最好者為八保棉花，可紡二十支紗。鄂棉除自給外，可接濟外省，水道運輸亦甚便利。本人此次來滬，除出席商聯會外，尙擬與貼放委員會接洽，過去押款限於原料，而機器不動產不能抵押，實不合理。本人已謁張總裁洽商此事，尙未有具體決定。</p>
<p>浙綢價上漲</p>
<p>浙江陳勤士會商：浙西今年春蠶夏蠶均好，故農民生活尙佳。國行今年貸款甚充分，例如絲織廠每一台機可貸三百萬元，織綢作抵押，亦得借款十餘億。一個月來，綢價上漲，故農民頗受實惠。地方秩序甚好，但民間風俗有待改善。交通方面，南潯至湖州之公路，希望政府能貸款十餘億，加速完成。此綫配合蘇嘉公路，勾通蘇浙交通，對繁榮兩省之經濟關係甚大。浙西之桑樹在戰時損失甚大，目並育憲數量頗受其限制，估計需時三年方可恢復。</p>
<p>粵走私猖獗</p>
<p>廣東商會何雅各：廣東之經濟情形本較安定，物價約較京滬低百分之卅，工商業亦不感原料之缺乏，相當繁榮。但目前大水為災，對於華南經濟，實為草大打擊。廣東之糖廠及織造業均發達，銷路遠及南洋。惟目前因外匯官價與墨市相去太遠，進出口均感困難。廣東海岸千餘里，走私猖獗，治本之道，當由政府與香港政府成立協定，方能有效取締。僑匯之流入香港豐市，尤為莫火之損失，估計美洲每年僑匯總數在美金二億以上，南洋各地僑匯尙未計算在內。</p>
<p>墨苛待僑胞</p>
<p>墨西哥華僑商會鄧川山：豐西哥華僑約有一萬人，均業雜貨店餐室百貨公司等。過去　政府片面規定：華僑新客不准入境，舊客返境以兩年為期，逾限亦不准入國。對華僑之商業，法律上與墨人平等待遇，但處處以「衛生不合規定」為藉口，任意罰款，予僑胞以壓迫。抗戰勝利後，墨國人民對我國之敬意提高，同時我國政府亦正在與墨政府談判訂立商約，將來形當能有所改善。</p>
<p>寗夏待開發</p>
<p>寗夏省商聨會舉事長喬森榮；寗夏為我國西北國防門戶，對日抗戰中日軍始終未至寗夏省境，僅省會受轟炸二次，共匪亦僅侵入三分之二之鹽池縣，今春且經國軍收復，故寗夏戰時損失甚輕。省主席馬鴻逵勤政親民，深得人民擁戴”省內公路交通暢通，貨物暢流，賀蘭山礦產頗富，惟缺乏資力及技術人材，大好寳藏迄未開發。「黃河百害，祇富一套」，河套即在寗夏境內，黃河兩岸沃土萬里，惜人口稀少，土不能盡其用，亟盼國內目光遠大之工商企業家，投資於西北。寗夏盛產藥材。羊毛。皮革，均係換取外匯之良好輸出品，若加以科學處理，寗夏經濟前途實可樂觀，且地處邊區，在國防經濟上亦有不可忽視之重要性。</p>
<h3>燃管會主委　徐樂天受審　傳集各證人　訊停配經過</h3>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋欵</h3>
<p>（一）侵佔祖產</p>
<p>潘彬鏞問　某用有有而遺房屋數局，已居用百年，民廿二三年間，某甲以自己名義，陳報土地登記，執有圖照產證為憑。近因土地局重行登記，佈吿老圖照不作為憑，須從新登記給證，不料同族某乙需意侵佔，乘甲方出外，竟擅自私下陳報，及甲知悉，向乙理論，乙謂此係公產，有老分書為證，雙方相執不下，請問（一）甲方已生百年之屋是否有絕對所有權（二）甲方執有民廿二三年第一次陳報登記之岡照產證可否提出作為憑證？（三）甲方當初陳報登記時，乙方並未提出異議，今竟私擅登記，藉口以老分書為證，有否侵佔罪嫌？</p>
<p>〔端木愷律師答〕乙主張該項房屋係屬共有，如在甲占有之百年中從朱完稅則甲自可訴求法院確認該房屋之所看權，並聲需鎭地政機關變更登記。甲前領之圖照得為訴訟上之證據，乙私控登記以圖不法，所有構成刑法上之竊佔不動產罪（刑法第三百廿條第二頁）。</p>
<p>（二）無理加租</p>
<p>余孝儒問　某甲於去年年底憑中向乙方租得市房一間，當言明六年為期，乙係一寡婦，故房票上由其子出面（當時乙尙米成年），現乙因事他往，並在該屋出其叔丙某執管，因丙某與甲意見不合，藉詞迫甲廷出，否則須增加房租，甲因無力再加，焦急萬狀，現有問題數點，請貴律師賜答為感。（一）乙婦與甲所訂之租契，自移交丙某執管後是否仍然有效！（二）丙某如無理加租，可否拒付？</p>
<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕（一）已存在之租賃關係，不因業主或管理人之更迭，而失其效力。（二）民法對於定期租賃之租金，未許隨時增减，縱因復員後辦理民事訴訟補先條例有增加給付可能，但增給未久，遞又加增，情事變更，無此速度，自可申明理由，促其反省，倘不獲已　可訴請法院衡定。</p>

<h3>復興公園多少遊人嘆息　紅舞女苦病輕生　寄發遺書·從容服毒　臨死預見營基穴　碑鐫小鳥身世慘不忍凄凉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕林黛玉型舞女方珍（見圖），二十五歲，廣東人，體態輕盈，姿容映麗，三年前曾化名施綺敏，貨腰於大都會舞廳，頗有學識，談吐不俗，故聲譽鵲起，紅極一時。嗣因患肺病，兼患肋膜炎，遂輟舞養病，因病勢日重，於六日四時，盛裝在復興公園服毒自殺。盧家灣警局發覺後，即送廣慈醫院救治，延至七日晨身死。昨晨地檢處曹檢察官赴同仁輔元堂騐屍後，由死者舅父朱春實，表姊朱芳菊，曁其生前諗客曾永祥領屍盛殮。方少失怙恃，孤苦伶仃，寄食於舅父家中，寄人籬下，鬱抑寡歡，幼年殆已種其根，五年前即患肺病，自下海為舞女，因營業頗佳，而方之孱弱身體，益感不支，未幾，遂吿輟舞，當時為其身體幸福計，曾將其伴舞所得，延海上名醫為之調治，所費不實，而病勢未見好轉。旋遵聲囑，</p>
<p>易地　療養</p>
<p>乃於云秋，赴無錫太湖濱肺病療養院療治。至上月廿二日，因金盡不得已重返滬地，暫居陜西南路祥生飯店四二六號房間，並至南京路一二〇號企雲醫師處檢驗，經許以X光透視結果，左肺業已腐爛，助膜骨八根均為之浸潤，已無痊愈希望。</p>
<p>方念前途渺茫，自殺之念油然而生。此時尙有一凄豐之捕曲，有數年不見之舞客曾永祥，忽於許醫師診所中相遇。曾係廣東人，因同鄕關係，故過從頗密。後因曾往外埠經商。方亦輟舞養病，數年不見，</p>
<p>一旦　重逢</p>
<p>驚臺交集，即由曾伴送方區祥生飯店，（該房間係何）</p>
<p>（宏業代開）曾見房間狹小，另代開四三二號大房間，選入居往曾雖百般安慰，翟方死志已堅，縣知肺病可以傳染，雅不願使人受害，遂將僅有之獖戒金節，盡行變賣，得一千餘萬元，於自殺前作種種周密部署，先至新閘路八三五號中國壽器公司定好棺材一，付五百五十五萬元，壽衣石灰導付一百五十萬元，繼至虹橋公基定好墓穴，並向附近建華大理石公司定好</p>
<p>石碑　一方</p>
<p>并自為設計，碑頭雕小島一隻，兩旁鑲有花朶，鳥下雕一「十」字，下刻「方珍」兩字，付四百萬元，準備停當，乃於七月五日用鋼筆寫信一封，致慮家灣警察局，由「十二」郵局寄出，略謂：「諸位執事先生大鑒，珍知自殺乃犯罪行為，惟幼無父母，孤苦伶仃，現身患肺病，經許企雲醫師診斷已病入膏盲，對於人世無可留連，惟有自殺而已。方珍」。信末蓋一指印。信寄出後，於翌日四時從容至復興公園，悄然入深林中，服大量安眠藥片自殺。有白皮鞋，白皮包，置於深林外走道上，因此即為人發覺。其懷中藏有「方珍自白書」，大意與致警局函相同，惟有七浦路三〇三弄（順慶里）十七號其表姊朱芳菊之地址，係囑彼前來收殮者。事後經警局往該處調査，尙遺有一箱，中留</p>
<p>名貴　香水</p>
<p>一瓶，有字條一，謂箱中有名貴香水一瓶，請於入殮時遍灑全身，此點其表姊朱芳菊業已照遺囑辦理。又方於首殺前，將所有生前照片，均付之一炬，即其靈前亦無遺像，本報刋出之照片，係百計覓得，為碩果僅存之一張。</p>
<h3>電車　出軌　四川北路一塲虛驚　幸未傾覆無人受傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午二時十分，英商一路電車B六二號自靜安寺駛向虹口公園途中。行至四川北路武進路口，甫過紅緣燈，因該處路軌年久失修，行駛稍速，車輛突然消出軌外，衝向左方太豐百貨商店門前近人行道處，車身幸未傾覆，乘客雖受驚嚇，尙無受傷。當經電吿公司當局，即派急救車及工匠等前往施救，先將後節拖車拖回原軌，前節車則用起重器稍稍抬起後，由對方駛來之電車設法拖至左邊軌道上，至三時三刻始吿恢復。在出軌時間內，四川北路上南北電車交通均吿停頓，自虬江路起至武昌路止，停頓之電車接通如一字長蛇。</p>

<p>基敎意義</p>
<p>按基本敎育（Fundamental　Education），是一個比較新的名詞。製造這個名詞的人士所以選定這個字，是因爲想把兒童敎育和成人敎育兩個觀念都包括在內，指示出這種敎育，不僅敎人讀書寫字和算數日，並且授給他們若干基本的東西，使他們可以謀生，改良他們的經濟情况，使他們可以藝術地有敎養地表達他們目己的思想，使他們可以改進健康生活的環境，參加國內及國際的政治活動，藉以引導他們走向比較充實而完善的生活。目前尙沒有一種名詞足以包容這些目標，因此，纔採用「基本敎育」這個名詞。</p>
<p>會議主旨</p>
<p>此次基敎會議之主旨，為：（一）從各專家方面搜集有關東方及南太平洋各國基本敎育的資料。此類資料，對於其他國家及聯合國文敎組織應具有相當的價値。（二）用下列兩種方法：（甲）交換基本敎育方面的經騐，觀念，問題，及工作成就之叙述。（乙）親身的接觸，去鼓勵東方及南太平洋各國之實際工作人員。（三）向參加大會人員報吿世界上其他國家基本敎育工作之情形。（四）使與會各專家熟識聯合國文敎組織之情形，特別是聯合國文敎組織對於基本敎育之旨趣與計劃。（五）對於中國的基本敎育示範設計中，應行華辦的試騐工作，作進一步之檢討，以期確定規範，藉作其他國家之借鑑。（六）對於世界各國基本敎育工作需要更大之努力一點，說明其重要性並予以鼓勵。（七）對於分區會議的技術，加以進一步的發展，以便將來應用於世界其他區域。（八）證實聯合國文敎組織對於東方及南太平洋之深切的興趣。</p>
<p>排定日程</p>
<p>會議日程已經排定如下：九月一日，舉行會議開幕式，中國政府委員致歡迎詞，聯合國文敎組織首席代表致答詞，宣讀聯合國文敎組織主席Directorl　General咨文，專家代表致答詞；一日下午，各地專家提出基本敎育之報吿。二日，三日，繼續報吿。四日，大會就下列四項問題，選任委員會：（一）基本敎育中之語言問題；（二）基本敎育中之閱讀敎材問題；（三）識字訓練之新工具的使用問題；（四）基本敎育之行政及組織，包括經費及人事問題。五日，委員會開會。六日，七日，參觀南京附近之名勝學校機關等等。八日，委員會開會。九日，委員會向大會報吿。十日，討論委員會報吿。十一日，推薦書之提出與討論。十二日，對一九四七年十一月在墨西哥舉行之聯合國文敎組織大會，草定若干建議。十三日，閉幕。</p>

<h3>港慈善綱球賽　南北英雄會戰　葉觀雄患熱病　表演未如理想</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕因雨延期的振災　球義寶，七月三日先演一幕，原屬單打對抗，但觀雄發熱，王文正患　疾，於是改作雙打表演賽，由萊觀雄，徐煒培對陶冠球王文正。</p>
<p>第一日比賽</p>
<p>改爲甫北靈打表演</p>
<p>南北四雄角逐，雙方俱有病者，演來未如　蓬。是戰以徐煒培表演最佳，葉觀雄帶病在身，到第四盤　，方見水準演出，幾記邊綫球，恰到好處。</p>
<p>陶冠球也有很好的表演，發球的勁力着實有勁，短抽急打，够敏捷，角度好，惜王文正力不從心，頻發「死球」，兼之幾個該勝的高壓機會，反而自殺，上網攔擊也及不上葉徐一對活潑有力陶王的敗，是技差一着。</p>
<p>賽程採五盤三勝制，徐先發球，在第一盤中，王陶先取兩局，但旋被葉徐迫成三比二，王陶反居下風，葉徐繼以六比四先取得第一盤勝利。第二盤是爭持最烈的一盤，各四，各五平手後，葉徐再勝二局，又以七對五壓倒王陶，造成連勝兩盤的局面。</p>
<p>到第三盤，情緒比較鬆恲了，陶王努力反擊，以六比四勝回一盤，成二比一，第四盤續葉，王文正疲態畢露，經不起葉徐的猛擊，以二比六再輸一盤，成三比一終局，葉徐得勝。最後，前台杯宿將江道章，與陶冠球來一盤單打表演，陶雖經四盤劇戰，仍銳不可當，以六對二擊敗「老江」。</p>
<p>第二次比賽</p>
<p>臺杯老將雙雙敗北</p>
<p>四日天氣絕佳，在中華遊樂會塲續表演單打，孰料葉觀雄發熱未能登塲，臨時將秩序改變，由陶冠球對徐煒培，王文正對江道章，這一下調動，形勢完全改觀，滬方兩將均以連勝兩盤之姿態，壓倒港將。</p>
<p>在冠球與煒培對打中，頗有精采演出，冠球長於氣，時用底綫猛抽，壓服　培，煒培雖亦間有上網攔擊，但奈力不足，故冠球卒能以六對二，六對三連勝兩盤。</p>
<p>壓軸道章迎擊王文正，「老江」在初上塲時，還有作爲，及後疲態畢露，文正勝得寫意，又以六比三，六比三相同比數，連下兩城，一對老台杯選手，就此雙雙敗陣，令人有英雄遲暮之感。</p>
<p>再辦一議賽</p>
<p>葉陶二雄一決勝負</p>
<p>這一來，究竟誰是網球霸王仍懸而未決，刻據陶王表示，其遲遲留港未返滬者，一爲義賽，亦爲欲與香港新霸主葉觀雄較量，希望能與「小葉」交手。</p>
<p>義賽主事人亦同此感，蓋欲增加善款收入，擬於來週二（八目）再舉辦一幕義賽，依原定秩序演出，由葉觀雄對陶冠球，王文正對徐煒培，若能成事，此兩對理想節日演來定使球迷滿意。</p>

<h3>乒乓總決第九幕　郵甲後來居上　華聨華先勝後敗</h3>
<p>二屆乓乒聯賽，八强總決第九幕，前晚八時在中央大會堂舉行，觀衆三百餘人，由沈柏鴻汪憶山分任栽判，接觸後，郵甲劉造時抽擋如意，以直落三輕取秦裕珩，次組郵用老將姜春山，攻勢猛烈，奈華聯華顧錦祥成竹在胸，以長抽還擊，穩健異常，美不支而敗，第三組華聯華徐芝福智勇俱全，演出特佳，三對一勝周新棠，四組主力戰華聯華隊長李飛驤對郵甲大將李光耀，二李解逐至烈，飛驤於上屆分部決賽中，曾見負於光耀，者番重逢，不敢大意，一路佔先，光耀無法反攻，一對三失利，飛驤報復前仇，並爲華聯華造三對一之絕對優勢。郵甲諸將相顧失色，蓋第五組張其洪似非華聯華周維新之敵，詎知其洪鎭定異常，小心應戰，周則反因情緒緊張而失常，頻頻自殺。張其洪以直落三擊敗周維新，而爲郵甲挽轉乾坤，功不可沒，此後兩組，郵甲趁戚遜捷，結果郵甲皮敗爲勝，以四對三破華聯羣，可議倖矣。戰績如下：</p>

<h3>棉布業議決五項辦法　協助當局抑古布價　一方面向編建洽商儘管善配布辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕紗布市面之上漲，當局曾嚴論同業負責人，速謀抑平之道。在棉布業市且先後有十數家受到檢査。故日來棉布市塲，已無大宗成交。有若干大號子竟乘機歇夏，以免引起糾紛。但昨日市價，仍不免穩中帶堅。自紡建開出後，額小價昂，終於市價亦為帶上。山西路之棉布商業同業公會號於政令之必須奉行，抑價之未有把握，昨日下午三時特召開理監事緊急會議。僉以時勢多艱，紗布又為各方之所矚目，一致決議協力平價，計其決議事項為（一）龍頭布紡建久無開出，市塲暫停交易。俟供應正常，再行恢復，以免刺激。（二）嚴格管制市塲，糾察非公會會員之入塲。（三）在市塲經手交易之經紀人聯誼會會員應各自整肅，並將所經手成交之對方，列號報吿公會。由公會稽査其買賣之是否正軌。（四）絕對禁止塲外之黑市交易。（五）市塲自上午八時起至十一時三十分止，下午停市。上開諸項，即由公會與經紀人聯誼會會街公吿，並由理事監事組織勸吿隊，分隊輪流在公會勸阻塲外黑市。另一方面，將由公會負責人向紡建公司接洽配布改進辦法，以安人心。據當業某權威者語人，時屆五荒六月，應屬淸檔。但紡管會停止後，紡調會對於棉紗之供應，迄未有規律辦法，以致織廠生產大减。且棉紗新議價甫出，又有續議之訊。客帮聞之，未免又起購運。近日市面之終於不免上漲原因在此。究其上漲之程度，原屬有限。以最受注目之龍頭細布而言，較之十日前，為自四十二萬漲至四十六萬，約漲上一成。如紗市有辦法，布之漲價，尙不難抑低云。又云顏料市面，近又上漲，色布之漲，主因似不在坯布而在染色加工費。以陰丹士林藍而言，染本大於坯布云。</p>
<p>了結交易居多　華股昨見回小</p>
<p>華股昨以業中空氣沉悶，環境不利，了結者多，形成供過於求，廣帮存多亦有出籠，新買力量有限，買氣終吿遏止，業中大戶，漸形動搖，上塲時曾一鼓作氣，檯面浮多，臨收前亦吿潰散，加以銀根吿緊，除五和永公外，終吿步降。</p>
<p>晨開低盤，遞永紗開出明漲暗跌，開後由一三三號六九號六五號賣到一〇八〇〇元，八九號七六號一六三號一一七號進至一一〇〇〇元，五七號二〇七號一五八號九一號一四號一八五號二一八號一四二號二三三號紛賣，被迫低至一〇六二五元。二三五號一九七號八五號九七號六一號二三二號八九號一五七號七五號買意尙殷，統益由八九號首先掛高至漲停。</p>
<p>永公由二二三號，遞永公由一〇五號二二六號，五和由二二二號寺，亦吿漲達限度。遞永紗步　到一一一八〇元，二三五號二二四號九四號二二三號一九七號二二號一〇二號二四號四號二三　運　賣出，八號億中，五六號中南雖進，仍吿步降至一〇七〇〇元。八二號五四號八九魷一〇四號一六〇號一八三號一〇二號業　，十時半。囘升至一一〇〇〇元，二號八九號一一七號一六九號　　，　降至一〇七五〇元。二二四號二〇二號　後一度進至一〇九〇〇元，二三五號一四二號一五三號一五二號不時供售，二二三號二二四號進後忽出，八五號二一二號一四號亦售，十一時四十五分低至一〇四五〇元</p>
<p>二一八號八五號一〇四號趁低有補，回升至一〇六〇〇元，一〇二號二一八號一一七號二三一號一九九號一五四號等了結，散戶俱賣，臨收前退至一〇二三〇元低價。二三一號七六號二二三號補進，午收升為一〇四五〇元，收後喊價升至一〇五〇〇元外。結果較前收計永紗尙平，永公漲一成，信和跌半成弱，新光跌半成强，美亞華豐景福勤興中法各跌一成光量，新華跌一成半弱，中紡平平，統益升半成，五和漲停。大通中絲國貨水泥內衣各降半成左右，麗安跌成半強，景綸跌一成，餘者升降咸微。遞交計永紗微降，信和新光勤興各跌半成左右，美亞華豐景福各跌一成光景，永公漲一成不到，塲外各老股除大生微升外，餘均回落少許。</p>
<p>中紡增資</p>
<p>上海證券交易所昨發通吿云：「茲據中紡紗為股份有限公司本年七月七日函稱，敝公司遵照工礦運輸事重估固定資產價値調整資本之規定，業經六月三十日股東臨時會決議，增加資本國幣七十一億二千八百萬元，速原有合成七十四億二千五百萬元。茲定於七月十日起至十六日止，為辦理增資及發自時期等語前來，該公司開始辦理增資手續，其股票應自七月十日（星期四）起，暫停交易，特此公吿。」</p>
<h3>公債外股均挫</h3>
<p>公債昨復見不支，統丙晨開七六〇〇元，高價七七〇〇元，而步降至七一〇〇元低價結束，業中人若五〇三室五五一室有納，三六〇室　二三〇室有供，結與前收相較，計甲乙各挫三百元，統丙降五百元，丁戊各跌二百元，成交一百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨除英聯外，均有回跌，證券帮銀行帮及廣帮均納，保險帮中人拋出較多。怡紗自晨開八四五〇〇元，步降至八一〇〇〇元低價結束，惟英聯有利安洋行等吸納而獨穏。結果較前收計會德豐業廣航業墾植徵降，怡紗紙業怡啤鋼業電話各跌半成左右，英聯微升</p>
<h3>現棉市況穏定</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况，棉紗雖吿小挫，然客戶仍多扳價，人心依然堅挺。同業銀根尙鬆，故買氣甚濃，紗廠納胃仍大，塲內浮多有售，散多抵補，供求呈平衡之勢，價亦穩定。各檔做謂送廠價計靈寳二〇五萬，老河口二〇五萬，沙市一九六萬，又棧交價計靈寳（特種）二二〇萬，又二〇〇萬，一九八萬，　米特林二〇五萬，沙市一八九萬五千，一八六萬，冲沙一九六萬，三餘鎭一七四萬，通州一七五萬，老河口一八九萬五千，太倉一五九萬，火機一六〇萬，周浦籽花每組（正牌）三二萬。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售二〇七三五疋。內廠商申請廿七戶，共購布一〇八〇疋。布號申購單共六八七張，共購布一九六五五疋。</p>
<h3>食米到貨充裕　市況賡續下游</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧七千一百餘石，川那贛皖均有到貨，湘省亦有到申，浙贛路已通，溫州台州亦有秈米來滬，台灣米遝到少數，市况賡續下游，供多求少，難望樂觀。最早者六十子新秈，即行見新，市塲去化仍懈，粳米秈米步跌萬元，中下再跌一萬三四千元，尙少受主。白陰元均見續跌萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉實銷奇淡，趨勢依然軟化，疲中徘徊。麩皮去胃轉呆，下挫二三千元，豆餅鄕　冷懈，形勢定局，惟營口餅汕頭交易蟬聯，挺進三五千元。黃豆到銷兩接，堅定之局。菉豆華南揀高拾取，仍為提高殺次，中下回低三五千元。赤豆靑呆少神，疲疲之狀。蠶豆平疲，紅糧沉悶，苞米下降二三千元，芝蔴存到兩少，洋莊搜購，奇貨可居，按步上漲，飛騰一二萬元。</p>
<p>生仁廣銷活洛，南洋猛吸，冉冉上騰，突出五十大關，步漲一二萬元。小麥僅零星成交，再呈疲削之勢，步跌三五千元。油市廣帮納胃濃旺，買氣甚盛，續躍二三萬元。小車蔴蔴油出百萬大關。</p>
<h3>日賠償物資　應多分配川省</h3>
<p>四川工商業鉅子劉航琛。鄧華民·潘昌猷·胡子昂。唐雲鴻·梅心如·張澍霖等，前為日本賠償物資，應多量分配，以建設四川，特電行政院·四川省政府·駐日代表團。表示意見。茲悉：王副院長愛五·川主席鄧錫侯·商團長震。昨日均有電覆，該省旅滬人士，定明日（九日）召開第二次會萬，有所表示。</p>
<h3>承前日漲風餘威　人絲上落微細　廠經堅穏綢貨又告高翔</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲上午　勢未戰，一二〇號高山有光，開盤三千〇六六十萬元，最高竟到過一百五十萬元，卒因價過高而乏人過問，乃稍下挫。中午收盤為一百萬元，下午因傳說人絲將有大量到埠，綢廠帮均存觀望，人心略軟，價再後退，最小喊過三千〇二十萬元，最後略見回上，喊三千〇五十萬元賣出，終與上日價軋平。其餘各牌貨，均隨之而升降，比上日價俱無上落。</p>
<p>昨市廠經堅穩，高勻度ABC等級因貨稀喊價較上日稍高，並無成交。D字E字等級成交價與上日相仿，中級另祖做價稍大，三千一百五十萬元至二百萬元，昨有十餘担交易。高級另担D字貨仍做上日原盤，干經另祖，價亦未更。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨因成本關係，又吿高翔，尤以被面為最。美亞被面市上棧單甚稀，昨日並無成交，喊價四百萬元有人要。大誠被面最大做開三百三十五萬元，後喊三十萬元，華強被面最大二十五萬元有成交，後做二十萬元，比上日漲起五十萬元之譜。大誠格子璧總開市經多方拉抬，喊價四萬三千元，但因賣多於買，卒吿不支，節節下降，最後一千八百元即期價，隔日期做二千一百元，比上日大四百元。華錦縐價仍喊二萬八千元，但乏供應，其餘各貨，均稍堅挺。</p>
<p>鐵路器材由美運滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕福來輪船公司經理之飛鷹恩脫批利斯（譯昔）號，前日自美抵滬，運來大批鐵路器材及工業器械，以及醫藥用具等。計火車車廂四輛，係江南鐵路局所購，起重機一部，（可吊五十噸貨物），總噸一百二十三噸。又麵粉機器五部，酒精九百九十噸計三千四百四十六桶，係聯總之貨，由給佛那地方運來，業已售與永豐行。又醫藥用具鐵器及什貨等共一千三百噸，亦係聯總之貨。</p>
<h3>棉紗市價下挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開市尙堅挺，四二支藍鳳紗一度昂至三百零二十萬元，旋以銀根趨緊，港電報長，紗廠有售，多頭見高出籠，價乃下挫。最後價為一千九百八十萬元，比上日回降二十萬元，二土又特雙馬亦回低六十萬元，為一千一百八十萬元，雙馬紗為一千零七十萬元，回小二十萬元。全日趨勢除四十支及卅二支細紗二十支特好做紗軋升一二十萬外，其餘十支十六支二十支及卅二支銀月四二支實光等組細紗，一致下挫十萬至二十餘萬元不等。</p>
<h3>紡調小組會　民營廠意見漸接近</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會於昨日上午十時起，召開成品運銷及議價兩小組聯席會議。並於下午四時，召開原料供應小組會。會議經過，據該會秘書處長袁仲達表示，已獲具若干結諭。民營廠方面與鄒主委之意見，已漸趨接近。今日上午九時卅分，將再召開第四次委員會議，商討各小組會所交議之案件。經部代理常次劉泗英，昨已自京來滬參加會蒙云。</p>
<h3>煙煤走銷漸旺</h3>
<p>煤市自煤塊因受焦煤傾銷影響，趨勢仍呆，行市途徘徊。烟煤走銷則漸呈活躍，行市亦堅秀。尤以烟煤塊，市上供貨見缺，市勢最俏。白煤屑因運費關係，源華屑上海交貨價，聞有調整訊，故近來供貨不多，市勢頗俏。煤球廠盤亦跟緊，所幸各煤炭店零銷不暢，一時難見上落。</p>
<h3>利買空氣濃厚　捲煙一致上升</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，飛黃騰達，蓋因調整捲烟稅率日近，永泰和對外埠同行派貨亦有延期之說，　終比上日繼漲廿四萬元。</p>
<p>老刀亦漲為七百十五萬元，五華上升三十三萬元，為六百廿八萬元。哈德門為五百七十五萬元。頤中公司之高等烟，大報未大三砲砲前門牌條烟，軋升自一千元至三四千元。華商烟美麗金鼠銀行白十蘭地克雷斯等，價亦一律步昂五百元至二千五百元。美貨路駝六更馬力斯等條烟及五十支聽裝烟，亦吿抬升一二千元不等。</p>
<h3>外銷錄茶堅俏</h3>
<p>抽珍珍眉等各種外銷綠茶，前因問漳者束手，市勢疲滯已久，適來因一部份出口商復在騐霜之中，人心遂頻頻韓堅，賣戶重現扳售之意，致昨目市上，雖乏實際交易，過程則較隔　更為緊俏。至於內銷茶，脫平仍不呆頓，行情續吐秀氣。他若廣帮一意欲辦之上白貢菊，則以貨主趦趄不一前，毫無做開，惟情况則如虎添翼，益見良佳，默察前途，頗有希望。</p>

<h3>忠魂向奸魔索命　暴雨與汚齊濺</h3>
<p>— 南京五日訊　本報特約記者丁匡華　丁逆伏默邨法</p>
<p>殺人魔王丁逆默邨，太兇暴了，太殘酷了，罪惡滔滔，曇行斑斑，他今天伏法在首都百萬市民面前，雖然是人人稱快，但我們覺得他的狗命不應延續到了今天，當局的遲遲覆決，不免令人失望，看吧！多少同胞在望，多少問胞在哭，更有多少同胞在追償血債，一番再番，一抗再抗，他（她）們在等急急了，道時兒，九泉下，忠魂合，也許正在和丁獻邨淸算，姦後殺害的鄭蘋如，自然是他最可怕的對頭了。</p>
<p>天宇第一號　舊賬被清算</p>
<p>由於丁逆默邨，不禁使我回憶到丁逆叛國殃民的始末和公審時的倔强。一副陰險的面孔，使人一看就知道他是「殺人魔王」！在抗戰以前以迄叛國時爲止，他在中樞負的責任的，在情報調査統計工作沒有分「中統」「軍統」以前，他就是担任調査統計局的第三處處長，國家的秘密，軍事的佈署，以及我們的情報組織，他沒有不明瞭的，中央這時對他是很重視的。直至民國卅年他還是軍委會的少將高參，料不到他搖身一變，跟著汪逆精衞叛黨叛國，汪逆精衛正利用他過去的工作關係，而重用他，而委以「偽特工」重任，以一個洞悉國家內情明瞭情報組絨佈署的「要角」，來進行與國爲敵，與政府爲敵的工作，自然是特別便利。在卅二年內我中央在敵僞的情報組織時時被敵僞破獲，我淪陷區地下工作同志，大多被「何特工」戕審，這都是丁逆默邨禍國殃民的滔天罪行，丁默邨實在是「天字第一號」要犯，較之書生式的頭號漢奸陳公博，　思平，林柏生，實在超出萬倍，應該千刀萬剖，才能貼服我們的人心！</p>
<p>獄中「豪語」荒謬得可怕</p>
<p>幾次的審訊，他始終是狡辯，不是說受敵偽的監視，就是把責任推在李士羣身上，將「七十六號」魔窟的罪惡，洗刷得乾乾凈凈，這些不過漢奸一般的理論罷了。最可惡的就是在第二養庭上他發表荒謬的論調，他說：「請看看蘇北吧！這樣混亂的局面，不如浙江一萬倍，浙江能在我的掌握之下，奠定了洽安的基礎，爲什麼蘇北弄到今天不可收拾，道理在那里，就是少了一個丁默邨」，看了上面一段的謬論，可知其當日横行不可一世的了。記得在二月初旬，記者雪中踏上老虎橋監獄探問丁默邨的時候，又是我印象最深刻的一次，記者曾問他獄中有無感想與反省，他說：「任援道，張嵐風，……過去都是受我的指揮的，他投機有武力，所以現在尙在作官，我現在是失去賭博資本的一個角色，現在又有什麼話好說」？證解一想，如果丁默邨不繳械，那麽必走入共黨的懷抱，再來福國殃民，那是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>首都高院二月八日判處他的死刑，那是天經地義，絲毫沒有冤枉他的；他有什麽顏面聲請上訴？五月一日最高怯院覆判死刑，丁逆仍是不服，五月十四日，五月廿七日又兩度申請再審，最高法院分別於五月廿三日，六月十一“駁回最後兩次抗吿，再於六月廿四日七月四日駁回，命運從此註定了，霹震一聲，司法行政部平字第二〇三九號執行令，終於五日上午十一時由最高法院檢察署轉達到了高院，高檢處立刻派了檢察官陳繩祖爲監刑官前往執行。</p>
<p>天怒兼人怨　「無話可說」</p>
<p>十二時記者即首先獲得消息，於二十五分鐘歐車至老虎橋首都監獄，時監獄中人尙無所悉，記者乃在監獄大門內右首之傳達室中坐候。其後各報記者聞訊趕到，多達四十餘人。一時二十分，天色轉變，陰雲四起，由燥熱而涼爽。四十分，陳檢察官繩祖偕同書記官及法警等乘小型吉普車抵達，駛入院內後，則關閉大門，嚴行戒備。陳檢察官到達後，即由孔典獄長陪同至刑塲勘察，時天色更爲陰霾，窗外雷聲隆隆，頻頻不絕。天怒人怨，人神共憤、大家跟巴巴佇看這巨奸的下塲，中</p>
<p>檢察官宣布執行命令時，丁逆戰兢了。「你有遺囑沒有？」檢察官問他。「遺囑要寫也來不及了，不過，不知我家屬有人來否」？說時，還張着那對無神的眼睛，望一下兩旁，發現沒有家人，於是繼續說：「對於家屬我沒有什麽話想說，不過以後家屬生活困難，我個人死了，也只有聽她們去了。……」</p>
<p>於是法官吿訴他，法律對家屬有着合理的解決，是保留酌量的生活費的接着又說：「你還有什麽話要說」？「我個人的事不談，但國家對一班漢奸案，不知是不是可以寬一點。對於他們，希望給予寬大的機會」。他的聲調有點發顫。說畢並奸笑不已。陳檢察官當斥稱：「法國面積不及我國四川一省，而所辦法奸案達八萬件之多，其中處死刑者有七千人。我國對漢奸案件之處理，迄今僅處死少數巨奸，不得讚不寬大。」繼即再度詢問有無遺言，丁逆思索少頃，答以「無話可說。」</p>
<p>檢察官一共問了三次，他都沒有話說。其實，從他蒼白的臉和迫促的呼吸，可以看出他心頭雖有千言萬語要稅，然而神情的慌張，使他一句話也說不出來，只得作着苦笑，勉强說：「沒什麼話說」。</p>
<p>到「地上」去　巨奸冠結了</p>
<p>至此，陳檢察官即簽署執行命令，命法警將丁逆押出。丁逆在法警擁呼中，已是神色倉皇，但他仍是強作「英雄」，自行步向刑塲。約十餘步後，經執刑警長祝崑峯三度喝止後，始行住足。丁逆甫欲向後回顧之際，祝警長即以駁穀槍對準後腦，砰然一擊，丁逆即仆臥地上，屍體向右側臥，蜷縮成弓形，雙手交又胸前，彈自前額右眉頭穿出？面部及褲上血跡斑斑，一分鐘後其四肢抽搐不已，儼如宰殺鷄鴨時所見之狀。其時執刑者欲補擊一槍，經監刑官勸阻始免。繼經法警將其二腿拉直，屍體朝天仰臥，於二時十九分始吿斃命。丁逆過去在堂上自詡「地下工作者」，至此一代巨奸果眞入「地下」去矣，誠可謂自食其言，人人稱快！</p>
<h3>青島之動與靜</h3>
<p>— 二日青島航訊　本報特派員會誠</p>
<p>每年七　八月，靑島有霧，自海面進入陸地達四五十里，風吹不散，且風愈勁而霧愈濃，迥異尋常。蓋七八月間，有一暖流自東南海面來，於此間與朝鮮海峽方面來之寒流相遇遂逼兼成霧。此爲特殊情形。據氣象台預測：七月初有劈三週，能見度在五十公尺至二百公尺。今日氣象台掛出訊號，說明今晨二時，在北緯四十度，東經一百十六度有一氣旋停滯或緩行。此地點當即爲北平附近。此間吹四級風，天陰而霧。故在最近，恐不能放晴。</p>
<p>海水浴塲開放</p>
<p>海水浴塲則已在一日開放。由於修理設備，開放日期自上月中遷延至七月初。此爲每年一度之盛事。今年夏遲，連日最熱時曾達八十度左右，今日則僅六十八度矣。故浴塲雖開放，而泳者殊寥寥。預計浴塲熱鬧時期，當在七月末與八月全月。過去每屆夏季，遠道擇地避暑者往往以有海水浴塲故，而捨莫千山，牯嶺或北戴河而取靑島也。靑島海水浴塲設備之佳，僅以華北各處海岸論，可苜屈一指，無出其右。</p>
<p>第一海水浴塲，即匯泉浴塲，在市區東部匯泉灣中，無暗礁隱　，無漩渦狂濤，面廣而沙平，浪舌拍沙，徐徐舒捲，爲海水浴及游泳之最佳地點。設備亦爲各浴塲冠，凡譽靑島海水浴塲者，當以此爲代表也。其設備有游艇，跳台，浮台，碼頭，艇板，板生圈，自來水冲水管。柵內隙地，布置花木及兒童運動塲。更衣室浴房林立，其建築極爭奇鬥姘，油彩奪目，益爲增色。第二海水浴塲在山海關路，位於市區東南之太平灣北岸，其地與岸上公園昆連，可容　間浴室百八十間，爲海浴勝地。第三浴塲在太平角，規種較小，略有花木設備。第四浴塲位市區南極東部，在湛山村之南，該地亦爲避暑人士所居，故特闢浴塲。第五浴塲在新疆路，係獨處於市區西北者，在海港碼頭附近，小港以北。第六浴塲在太平路南，前海棧橋西，昔有浴室，現已毁壞。浴塲東西兩端有暗礁。第七浴塲在燕兒島，該處非孤懸水中之島，實　一突出處，靑年會之少年營房屋，警局之鴿信所在焉，夏季爲浴場，秋季爲觀潮勝地。</p>
<p>頃開放者爲第一，第二，第六等處，第三，第四，第六，則專借於美軍，由美方管理。此一年一度之盛事，雖今日兵荒兵亂，海濱風光，仍當不輸昔日也。</p>
<p>黃色炸藥奇談</p>
<p>數月之前，此間治安機關曾逮捕一商人，截獲其所運之商品，箱上印有「曹達」字樣，試其藥末，可助燃燒，投之水中，則　氣泡，試以已熄火柴，可使重燃，略有爆炸性。遂認爲炸藥，該商人也被扣留，且吃苦頭，蓋該商人係運貨至維縣者，不無可疑，雖供此爲工業用原料，但無可如何。旋以藥品交山大敎授檢定，視之乃過氧化　Na2O2也。</p>
<p>最近則又有黄色炸藥將毁滅靑鳥之消聞。以訛傳　，說者不檢而聽者不察，遂成奇談。先是，月前敵僞產業處理局標售物資一批，係黄色碎片狀物，作爲染料標售，此係由海關及中紡公司化騐認定者，旋由染料商人王　團，郝讚等合標購得，計二千九百斤，計六百三十八萬元。該商人認爲此係問接染料那富妥，Naphthol，但究爲×或BNaphthol，則不知焉。惟以之染黄色卡其，確有效用。此物能燃燒，蓋染料大多能燃燒，亦且能爆炸。此爲偵緝隊所査獲，當將王馨圃等帶隊訊問，始悉底蘊，據該隊稱：經羅氏化騐所證明，此物確爲TNT。於是將二千九百斤藥品提出，由警局暫爲管理。然海關之檢騐爲染料，則其根據究以何者爲依歸，則殊成問題。且若干化學技師亦頗爲詫異，至此，黄色炸藥險將毁滅靑島之消息已傳而聞矣。即退萬步言之，此若爲純粹之黄色炸藥，其重不足一噸半，可能炸去房屋數棟，殊無毁滅靑島之可能。此種聳人聽聞之傳說，當局頗注意。</p>
<p>事實上此間化學界人士正頗注意，據山大某敎授對記者言，此類有機物之化騐，以靑島目前所知之設備，難有把握，除非交中央硏究院，則其設備當能肯定此爲何物。至於察其顏色，似又不似所稱之Napohthol，因Naphthol爲白色。若謂TNT，實亦不似。正作嘗試之化騐。</p>
<p>事雖奇談，所關涉者則屬多方面，予吾人之啓示與敎訓實至深。</p>
<p>難民問題嚴重</p>
<p>靑島宛似一孤島，除海定而外，對外無陸上交通。最近中航公司以上次膠濟路斷，濟南商客三千餘人滯留此間，前往登記基機者達五百餘人，此次特撥機一架，以運送之。待輸送完畢，該機即離靑島。故外來者倘欲飛濟，短時中不可能，蓋並非班機也。</p>
<p>此間難民十七萬，爲約略估計之數字，但亦接近。流亡學生亦達萬人。當靑島接收之初，原有不少空剩之敵產房屋，及難民源源而至，遂使各處人滿爲患，今日靑島，貸一餘屋，亦頗困難。行總魯靑分署結束，過去接受接濟之四萬人亦吿斷炊，問題業生。幾乎束手無策。各方乃組織臨時振濟會，亦言多於行，無米之炊，總感爲難。乃決組織晋京請顧國，由市府塡款三千萬爲旅費。向中央請求撥款撥糧兩事，聲明如不能達到目的，決不返靑島決心。並請李市長先良爲先導，先行入京，陳述地方情形。由官民向中央一致力爭。氣候放晴，當即成行，十餘萬嗷嗷待哺之難民，或希望在此一舉，能有一具體辦法。前傳中央向粤省詢問海南島方面是否可以安插此間難民，此間事先不知，但由此可證地方情形，經呈報中央後，中央顯然極具關心，並正尋覺具體辦法也。</p>
<p>目前第一步首先着重疏散，但靑島爲孤島，現已有九萬人接受貝體之安頓，疏散至陰息民間分配保甲居住，行總魯靑分署，雖近尾聲，近仍撥出雜糧三十噸至疏散區，俟難民到達，即開始發放。壯丁難民，該臨振會經與警備部沦妥，將前組訓之難民壯丁五百三十人、由要塞司令部編爲守備營，同時，師管區方面，亦繼撥壯丁入訓練隊，以爲安插。</p>
<p>臨振會方面與難民合作結果，使日前難民之騷動漸趨平靜。但靑島神經緊張，稍有風吹草動，一般情緒即感不安。如何使其安定，自待深思熟籌。</p>
<h3>臺灣最大機械廠　主要出品：引擎·漁船</h3>
<p>— 高雄主月卅日航訊　本報記者楊育</p>
<p>伴着臺潑糧業的進展，日本人曾在民國八年的十一月間，在高雄創設了一所「株式會社臺變鐵工所」，這中是家私營工廠，然而內部機器設備，俱臻上乘，它担當了修理與製造全台灣各糖廠機械的大任，很表現過一番成績。太平洋戰爭爆發，配合了日本軍間的侵略狂，這家鐵工所也就被利用了來作爲機械工業與造船工業進行的塲所，單從當初擁有工人三千名與職員八百餘名的數字來看，乙不難瞭解到這個臺灣最大的機械工廠的規模輪郭。</p>
<p>新式靡床　日人拋沉海底</p>
<p>現在這所工廠，已與基隆的造船廠同隸於臺灣機械造船公司，改名爲高雄機器廠，來推動新生台灣的機械造船工業。過去它有着如此雄厚的實力：工作母機包括車床一六八部，鑽床五六部，牛頭創床十二部，龍門創床十四部，銑床三二部，鏜床十一部，磨床三十七部以及其他設備一〇九部，共計達四三九部之多，造船部門有60M×40M及55M×25M的船合各一，以及60M×25M與60M×12的引船臺各一。熔鐵　網也擁有五噸的熔鐵爐二座，三噸熔鐵爐二座，一噸煉鋼電爐一卒。起重運轍設備有十五噸吊車八架，三—十噸手動吊車五架，二十噸起重機一架，鐵道直通厰內，具有極便利的運輸網。經過轟炸，工作母機的運用程度只達到百分之三十五左右，甚至有許多新式磨床已被日本人拆卸了沉到海底去，但生產能力目前還能同時建造一七〇噸的木船兩艘，可以修理七千及一萬噸船舶一艘，每月可熔鐵一百噸，煉鋼二十噸。</p>
<p>講買力弱　資金局轉不靈</p>
<p>據該厰畢組長語記者，現在業務着重在製造一百十五匹與二百匹馬力的柴油引擎與建造六五。一七〇·二〇〇噸的漁船及修理鐵路機關車。一七〇噸的漁船，自光復後絡續完成了四艘，但衹售去三艘，一艘資台第四號至今還沒有買主。二〇〇噸的漁船連同引擎漁具一切裝備去年售台幣七百萬元。六十五噸的售八十五萬元，已有二艘賣給上海工程公司。畢組長說這價錢不能算貴，只要捕上幾次魚就可以隒出本錢，銷路所以不能如理想，還是民間　買力太弱的緣故。</p>
<p>記者在厰內的機械工塲，修理工塲，電氣鑄鋼工塲，造船工塲作了次巡禮，發現到這裏的機器所適應的範圍極廣，勢凡一般鑄鍛及機器加工與各種工作機械，它多能勝任愉快，但是因爲資金的周轉不靈，營業很難有高度的開展，客戶需要什麽就做什麽，這樣就難免會辜負了這裏精良器械的能率，記者也看到許多車床鑽床上在造些不相干的小零件。機器工厰本身的苦悶也在這裏。</p>
<p>推銷機構　竭力爭取市塲</p>
<p>畢組長也表示，沒有一定的經費，就是出品隊了錢，也還是沒有辦法。何况出品除掉引擎。漁船外，就很少能固定，因此配料和工作兩方面多感到了不便，賺錢更談何容易？他也贊成記者的意見；要使營業步上正軌，推銷機關不能設在廠內，一定要在上海等地才行，爭取市塲，就是爲工廎爭取前途。</p>
<p>受了經費影響原料也成了問題，生鐵·鋼板·元鐵·鋼條，只有些以前從日本及中國東北運來的存料，每月總共用量在二萬公斤以上，今後供求能否圓滑，就要看工廠的營業能否好轉了。至於其他如木料取之於阿里山，油料。氧氣。電石亦由本省供給，似乎目前還不虞匱乏。</p>
<p>當記者要吿辭的時候，學組長順便談起了這裏一千多個工人的情形，他說待遇平均在五千元左右，可是當地幾次工潮多是這裏的工人領導，也許是知識水準比較高的緣故，可是要說爲了生活，那待遇已比別的廠家要優越。所以在人事管理上，却是件很傷腦筋的事情。</p>
<h3>率講買舊船　與擴充噸位</h3>
<p>— 黃振東</p>
<p>航業為立國之本，國運之隆替，一國工商文化經濟之盛衰，胥視其國航業之發達與否爲斷。我國航業幼稚，一應設施，素落人後，以戰前噸位言，不過五十餘萬噸（即合怡和太古及外國不定期輪船約一百萬噸而言，亦祗一百五十萬噸），且因受不平等條約之束縛，航權旁落，歷數十年之久，痛心孰甚！今當大戰之後，日本戰敗，世界改觀，不平等條約廢除，航權收回，此實爲我國航業復興建設，自力更生之良機。按第二次世界大戰前，日本全國之商船噸位爲五百五十萬噸、現存約一百五十萬噸，我國於復員後已自殘餘之十萵噸，突增至八十萬噸，已超過戰前之噸位，此誠良好之現象。然此美戔之數，與世界各國之噸位相較，不逮遠甚，不特未達世界諸先進國家航業之水準，即與戰敗國之日本相比，亦有未及。如再論以應相配合之碼頭，倉庫。造船，修理種種設備，更膛乎其後，莫能與之頡頏。此實爲我國航業界之恥辱。而以我國海岸綫之延長，幅員之遼闊，一旦政局安定，交通恢復，上項噸位，以之供應內河及沿海航運之用，已嫌不敷，更遑論開闢遠洋航綫，與國際間先後國家航業相抗衞矣。</p>
<p>抑尤可慨者，我國造船設備，尙在萌募時期。現有造船厰，規模較大者僅有五處，即上海江南造船所，靑島海軍造船所，福建馬尾船厰以及基隆，高雄二地兩所而已。即以上述之造船厰言，船塢之長度最長者，不過六百尺，可容之最大噸位，不過一萬五千噸。以如此之設備，應付船舶之修理，已嫌不够，欲求其大量增造新船，以供需要，自屬不可能之事。</p>
<p>在如此情勢之下，爲應航務急需而謀噸位之擴充，以適應此初期之需要，捨向國外購買外輪莫由。而對航商購買外國舊輪，似不應以年齡及吃水之限制爲唯一之尺度，蓋判別輪船之優劣，重質而不驚其表；而應以船身之堅固，機器性能之優良，爲選購之對象。各國於戰時爲應付戰爭急需而匆促急造之新船，其品質性能，反不若舊船之佳，爲舉世所知之事實，故擴充噸位，不宜專以船齡爲取舍者也。</p>
<p>此外，我人深切期望於我政府者，即政府應鼓勵航商向國外購買外輪，如畀航商以貸款及以船舶押款之便利。而對我國特別需要之船舶，尤以與國際貿易有關聯之船舶，更應予以補助，或予以長期低利貸款及結算外匯之優惠，今者噸位日見擴充，應進而求船質性能之改進，更進而充實造船之設備，則假以時日，我國航業，不但可取日本之地位而代之，更可與先進國家航業爭一日之短長矣。</p>

<h3>叛逆的突擊</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>懷着劉備訪諸葛的心情，廖棟找到了麗華的師友劉子雲，把和麗華見面的經過一一吿訴劉子雲。求劉子劉出面挽回僵局，救麗華，也救他！</p>
<p>劉子雲明白這種情形，她會接到過　華一封信，向她呼籲的一封信。她知道楊局長追求麗華，她也知道麗華絕不會愛楊局長的——一個倚勢欺人，貪汚作弊，團積居奇的無惡不為的國難賊。麗華愛的是廖棟——一個向上的靑年，英雄。但儘管麗華是這樣，　更知道麗華的母親墨太太却不是這樣。墨太太不懂得人格的珍貴，只崇拜金錢，因此墨太太用不着徵求麗華的同意，直是逢迎着楊局長，逢迎着她心目中的財神。</p>
<p>「問題不在楊同長，而在墨太太，墨太太要在楊局長的身上撈回戰爭所給她的損失，所以她需要拿麗華引誘楊局長，但她可不一定就讓麗華嫁楊局長。只是楊局長的錢也不會白化的，楊局長目的在娶麗華。墨太太沒有想到這些，麗華想到了又無可奈何於墨太太，所以麗華痛苦！」劉子雲冷靜地分析着這個問題的關贊，同時心裏在思索着應付這個問題的辦法。</p>
<p>『問題已經很嚴重，任其發展下去，實在太危險了，劉先生！請您想想法子吧！』</p>
<p>『麗華怎樣對你說？』劉子雲關心地問。</p>
<p>「她祇說呌我救她，呌我來向窟請敎。因此我述夜趕到這裏，我希望您能帮助我。』廖楝囁嚅地說，仍不免顯露出一種羞澀之態。</p>
<p>『我知道麗華很愛你，』劉子雲沉着地說：『但是墨太太却米必愛你，所以首先你須要把墨太太聯絡好，使她對你發生了好感，然後你和麗華的問題才能有進一步的發展。』</p>
<p>『假如我現在就向麗華求婚？』</p>
<p>『麗華作不得主。』</p>
<p>『那麽我去求墨太太答應。』</p>
<p>劉子雲想了想，然後向廖棟說：</p>
<p>『好的，明天我陪你一道去重慶，讓我先探探墨太太的口氣，然後見機行事，現在我再陪你去看看我的朋友，也是麗華的朋友，董劭凌先生，他也許有更好的意見；而且將來還需要他的帮助。』</p>
<p>於是，廖棟隨劉子雲去拜訪董劭凌，廖楝在武漢時見過董劭凌的，這次深談以後，彼此的印象都很好，廖棟尊重董劭凌如師長，董劭凌也非常愛護廖棟，正如　助凌鼓勵麗華耐心等廖棟一樣。又勸廖棟不放鬆地追求麗華。董劭凌的意思，以為只要麗華有志氣，不怕墨太太反對；甚至軍　凌主張廖楝立刻就和麗華訂婚。自然須由麗華徵得墨太太的同意，墨太太答應則已，不答應，再由第三者出來撮合。董劭凌的主張恰中廖棟的下懷，劉子雲覺得這樣作太沒有把握，不如先和墨太太聯絡好了感情，然後慢慢下手比較妥當。廖棟性急，同時因為工作的牽制，時間上不可能常常接近斃太太，所以估計很雖有聯絡的效果。倒是董劭凌想出了一個折衷的方法，就是雙管齊下，一面要麗華跟墨太太明朗表示，一面讓廖楝向墨太太努力獻殷勤，迎合墨太太的歡心。</p>
<p>廖棟非常感激董劭凌這番熱誠的指示，第二天淸平便匆匆偕同劉子雲離開北碚，中午就到了重慶。劉子雲敎他去買了些禮物　送墨太太，因為劉子雲知道墨太太是愛小便宜的，獻殷動必須從還　着手。果然，這次見到　太太比上次待他親熱多了，留着他吃晚飯。就在吃晚飯的時候，他向墨太太百般表示他對麗華的愛，並說明他和麗華的哥哥寳鈴的友誼，如今他願代替寳鈴孝敬墨太太，他很懇切地說：</p>
<p>『我和寳鈴哥自幼在一起長大，情同骨肉，他的母親就等於我的母親，而且我又恰是一個沒有母親的人，所以我一定會把您當作我自己的生身母親一樣看待，」</p>
<p>『那我可不敢當，廖先生！』墨太太謙虛地說。</p>
<p>這時麗華直一聲不言語，吃罷飯就匆匆先和妹妹麗雲上戲園子去。廖棟送他們，一則路上想同麗華談談話，二則順便聽　華道天晚上唱的「宇宙鋒」。他們走後，只剩下劉子雲與墨太太了，劉子雲便趁機會向墨太太進行試探的工作。</p>
<p>『廖棟這人很忠厚，很有志氣，是一個好靑年。』劉子雲先把廖棟獎了一番。『他非常喜歡小華，小華對他也不壞。我想，你們旣是同鄕，他和寳鈴又是好朋友，倒不如作成親戚。——你老人家覺得怎樣？』</p>
<p>『你的意思是說要替廖棟作媒，把小華嫁給他嗎？』墨太太有些詫異地瞪着眼睛間。</p>
<p>『並不是什麽作媒，反正他們都早已認識了的。不過我却覺得他們挺合適。』</p>
<p>『你說小華會願意嗎？她的脾氣你是知道的。』墨太太又很狡滑地笑着問。</p>
<p>『小華一定會願意，她很久以前就向我，還向實鈴表示過！因為她也覺得廖棟是一個有希望有前途的靑年，只是她不好意思向您說罷了。』劉子雲泰然地回答。</p>
<p>墨太太更驚訝地楞住了。她沉默着思索了一會，然後半信半疑地說：</p>
<p>「她會願意嫁給他？』</p>
<p>『為什麼不會呢？她喜歡廖棟，再說她也到了該結婚的年齡了。』，</p>
<p>『那可不見得，小華不過二十八歲，』墨太太有些不服的樣子。『如今這年頭不比往年·姑娘三十出嫁也還不遲。』</p>
<p>『這除非作姑娘的自已情願，不然，作父母的也不能硬呌她等到三十再出嫁。』劉子雲開始了辯論。</p>
<p>『我並沒有硬時小牽　到三十再出嫁。但是我不信她會眞的喜歡　棟。』</p>
<p>『為什麽？』</p>
<p>『你忘了，過去恁麽多有錢有勢的人喜歡她，現如今還有個楊局長正迷着她，她却不肯嫁，難道她昏了，揀來揀去會揀上了個一無所有的廖棟？我不信。』墨太太堅定地說。</p>
<p>『您不明白小華，她最不喜數的就是那些把女人當玩物當花瓶的「有錢有勢』的人，她要嫁的正是像廖楝這樣「一無所有」，而具有熱情和忠心的靑年；您不信可以去問她。我因為知道得很淸楚，所以敢這樣吿訴您，現在只要您同意，她是決無問題的。』</p>
<p>墨太太沒想到問題擱在了她的身上，她纔着眉頭稍稍考慮了一會兒，然後很堅決地回答劉子雲。</p>
<p>『我不同意。』</p>
<p>『什麽原故？』劉子雲不放鬆地追問。</p>
<p>『我不喜歡這個人。』墨太太毫不遲疑地說。</p>
<p>『可是，我說過，小華喜歡他，您不喜歡是沒用的。因為這是小華個人的終身大事。』劉子雲又堅決地辯駁着。</p>
<p>『為小華着想，她不應當嫁廖棟這樣的人。第一』，墨太太先思忖了一下說：『廖棟養不活小華。第二，廖棟是空軍，今天不知道明天還活不活；因此我可不能讓小華去冒這個險。再說，她還不到該歇業的時候，她的藝術要緊。我旣然是她的媽，我就作得她的一半主。』墨太太最後有點氣了！</p>
<p>『您的理由不能成立的，伯母！您只看到廖棟現在沒有錢，而您沒看到廖棟是一個有作為的靑年，將來他的前途很遠大的。至於您躭心空軍生命危險，可是，處於戰時，即如不是空軍，生命也一樣的危險。您忘了實鈴不就是死在轟炸中的嗎？相反的，空軍只要技術好，經騐豐富，倒有保障些。說到小華的藝術，出了嫁不一定非歇業不可；廖棟也是愛藝術的人，他不會干涉小華唱戲。只是小華自己倒早已厭倦了。所以，我勸您最好成全他們道件事，如果您不願他們馬上結婚，先讓他們訂婚也是一樣。』</p>
<p>劉子雲的話已經引起墨太太的反感了，像五六年前在開封時一樣，她覺得劉子雲又在那裏從事敎導　華背叛她的工作了。因此她很想頂撞劉子雲幾句，可是她不敢；她怕的不是劉子雲，她怕麗華。麗華的脾氣她是知道的，惹惱了事情更糟。這陣子為了楊局長的問題團華已經跟她鬧過幾次了。</p>
<p>『我想，這件事不必太急，讓他們再多認識認識。只要小華情願，我作媽的也管不了許多。』墨太太壓抑着一肚子的不痛快勉強這樣敷衍着。</p>
<p>『不過據我知道，他們早已有了很深的認識，而且有了很好的感情。旣然您不固執成見，只是時間上的問題，那麼還是我剛纔的意思，就讓他們先訂婚得了。』劉子雲見墨太太已經讓步了，於是更逼緊些說。</p>
<p>『沒有這麽容易，劉先生！』墨太太終於堵住了劉子雲的嘴，不容劉子雲再說下去了。</p>
<p>到了夜間，麗華唱完戲回來，劉子雲把和墨太太談話的經過吿訴豐華，要麗華再直按向墨太太明自地表示一番，至少可以逼墨太太答應訂婚的事。麗羅聽了劉子雲的話心裏很難過，知道這無異是自已的生死關頭了，於是悄悄決定和命運作一次最奮勇的搏鬥。</p>
<p>第二天麗華剛去預備和墨太太談　個問題，適巧楊局長來了，麗華連忙躲開。在裏面房間內麗華竊聽楊局長利誘臺太太把麗華嫁給他。說他的前妻死了一年多還沒有續弦，為的是他的條件很高，不客易碰到合適的。如今他愛上了麗華，他願意娶麗華，並且負責墨太太的終身生活，大家儘可以住在一起，他可以把墨太太當作他自已的母親孝敬。又說到他在四川的不動產，成都有出地數百畝，南岸黃山有別程，重慶有住宅兩幢。還有商行股東，銀行在款等等。一派甜言蜜語說很墨太太垂涎三尺，但又不能作主像貫賣一樣立刻答應把麗華嫁給他。同時可眞捨不得回絕這麽好一個機會，沒有昨天廖棟的岔兒倒還罷了，有廖棟這個岔兒，墨太太就得先把握住這個機會。因為這樣可以使楊局長去對付廖棟了。於是　太太吿訴他，願作主促成這件事，不過還需要麗華本人的同意。談到這裏，麗華像旋風一樣闖了出來，不曉得從哪兒來的勇氣，逕向墨太太面前撲過去。</p>
<p>「媽，您怎麼可以這樣講！』麗華正顏厲色地說。接着轉向楊局長。『楊局長，請您不要相信她的話，我的事她一點也不能作主，雖然她是我的母親，但我已到法定的年齡，她是沒有權力干涉我的自由的。對於你們剛纔所談的問題我都聽見了，現在讓我來鄭重地答覆您，那是絕對不可能的。所以謁您也不必白費心思了。』</p>
<p>『為什麼？』楊長不禁驚詫地問。</p>
<p>『因為我已經有了對象，我和他就要訂婚了。』麗華斬釘截鐵地說。</p>
<p>『小華！』墨太太念忙制止地喊着。</p>
<p>『　不信嗎？媽！那麽，讓我再明白地吿訴您一遍，我愛的人是廖棟上一個沒錢，沒勢，只有熱血，只有忠心的空軍，我就要和他訂婚了；因為我們是情感的結合，不是買賣的結合。所以我們之間絕無任何條件。』麗華一鼓作氣說完她窒息在心頭許久的話。</p>
<p>『好吧！』楊局長聽罷麗華的話，又氣又　地連吿蘇都不告計就走了。</p>
<p>這麽一來，墨太太可眞是又急又恨，臉都變色了，她幾乎舉手想打麗華，衝到她面前，顫抖地大聲叱着：</p>
<p>『我不許，我不許你這樣不顧廉恥地想嫁誰就嫁誰！』</p>
<p>『您不許也沒有用，媽！我和廖種早已有了關係了，所以我是非嫁給他不可的。』</p>
<p>『小華！』。連悄悄走進來的劉子曇也驚呌了。</p>
<p>『啊！』同時黑太太大呌一聲，昏倒於地。</p>
<p>是的，誰也沒有想到麗華會講出這樣的話來，連她自己都不知道是什麼力量使她這麽勇敢。她確是脫口而出的。她見墨太太武斷反對她，她便急中生智用了這麽一個使黑太太所不齒的理由去搪塞，並且還魯廖棟撤淸了責任。眞是太不可思臆了，她竟終於向墨太太也是向她自己的命運，作出了最堅堅決的叛逆的突擊！</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血338</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>W君聽見我如此一問，立即停步，瞧了我一眼，便揀出一張軍用簡圖，舖在辦公桌上，指給我瞧：「…這裘面可說五分·福命五分僥倖—這個兆頭不壞，將來準可以戰勝矮鬼—」定W君有些興奮了。</p>
<p>我移座過去，要看這五分福命。究竟在哪裏。</p>
<p>「大概鬼子迷信這個「八」，淶信得透了頂，一方面凑熱鬧，準備響應「八的秘密」發動，一方面遵照原議行軍計劃，預備八月八日發動西北攻勢，作為鄭州大會戰的先頭行動：」</p>
<p>『我不是軍事家，雖然署過田中奏摺，也聽鶴見說過日寇侵略行軍計劃，大意是要『速戰速決』，旣是速戰速決，我只不懂他們何以要大兜圈子，繞道山西太原，才會師鄭州，會師武漢呢？從平漢路直接沿路南下，豈不省事得多？」</p>
<p>「不成，行軍不能貪圖省事；」W君放下了「五分福命」的題目，就地在他那張實座上坐下，一手撫在舖開的地圖上，大有戲台上諸葛亮「我有一言，爾且聽了」的神氣：</p>
<p>「沿交通綫作戰，最怕對方的大軍側擊。請想，山西的軍隊，雖然陳舊了些，然而劉汝明的二十九軍，現正控制着晋北的門戶，湯恩伯的十三軍，堵住了西北要津；傳作養的鐵騎，把住了綏晋重鎭；並且這三方面以及閻老的其他精華部隊，都在靜候動員。您想日本鬼子，眼光也相當軍利，難道他只顧南下會師，就不怕這幾支大軍一衝而出，把他們截成幾段嗎？為了這一點，他不得不先打山西。打山西的戰略是鉗夾式，一面由平漢緩緩南下，一面走平綏與張北南下的寇軍，會師大同，然後直取太原，下潼關，與平漢一路，會師鄭州。這樣，南下的主力，就沒有後顧之憂了。「…况且還有山西的資原。…」</p>
<p>「督日方的特務，那樣拼命往太原，大同，一批一批偷襲過去，原來做的開路工作。」我插口添上了這一句。</p>
<p>「豈只開路，要是　我兩方面，再不去攪牠一下，日寇主力軍隊，簡直可以兵不血刃，長驅直入，垂手而取西北半壁哩！」W群冷笑着。</p>
<p>「老兄的『五分簾福命』就是指這一點？」我有些木然的問着。</p>
<h3>黃昏</h3>
<p>— 民楊治</p>
<p>黃昏，半落的夕陽，戀着蒼茫的山巔，一堆一堆橘紅色的晚霞，輕漫地抹上了淡藍色的天空。</p>
<p>是夏之黃昏呢！……</p>
<p>寂寞和空虛，我忘掉了季節與時光，葬埋了靑春的風采，把生命的一部，送給星星的流光，彷彿在大雪的郊原裏，死酷與冷寂，嗅不到一分熱的氣息。</p>
<p>家外的曠塲上，環坐着許多人，有男有女，有說有笑，點綴了夏之傍晚的無窮熟鬧。女孩子的濃黑的頭髮，飄揚在微風裏，少女的白嫩的粉臂和大腿，沐浴在夕陽的金色的光芒裏。……</p>
<p>於是我便開始沉默了。</p>
<p>「這涼快的夏晚，是屬於誰的呢？」</p>
<p>再寂寞的抬起頭來，殘陽已和山　告別，天上飄飄的流動着幾塊淡黃色的雲，飛來一隻鷹隼，彷彿帶着輕快的綢子，平張着雙翼，迅疾地穿過了雲層。</p>
<p>於是我太息於這遠遠的世界……</p>

<h3>萬元救災運動</h3>
<p>— 十郞</p>
<p>廣東廣西在鬧着嚴重的水災，山西鬧着　災，成都因為錦江泛濫，城區千餘居民悉遭滅頂。中國人民眞是水空火熱之中，這個比喻，在現在現在看來，並不過份的。</p>
<p>廣東廣西災區泛濫甚廣，災民究竟有多少，尙無從統計，單以廣西全省算，饑荒加水災，災民逾百五十萬，山西旱災，災民竟遂五百萬人。</p>
<p>以上海這個窮奢極侈的角度來看各地的災荒，我們眞有說不出的漸愧！據說廣西災區，一個小孩子只賣一萬塊錢，以上海米價五十萬元一担折算，這一萬元只値二升米，但在災區却能買一條命呵！　　第一晚，上海　在聲極歌舞塲中消耗的數字，一定是可怕的。酒店，舞塲，戲院，誰不在盡歡極樂，誰曾偶一體念到數百萬災胞在死亡綫上掙指扎！</p>
<p>我們，如若能在這些塲合裏，每一個人，能省下一萬元，捐給兩粵，山西四川等地的災民，在我們，又算得了什麽呢？</p>
<p>所以，我敢向全上海人民呼籲，我們不妨來一次萬元救災運動。我們籲求上海清誤的，有良知的男女市民，自動的每人捐出乙萬塊錢，來救濟我們苦難的災胞！</p>

<h3>制止細菌攻擊—一種治肺癆的新藥</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>日昨見本報刋載着一段治肺癆新藥的新聞云云：『合衆社大西洋卅日電：波恩醫師在美國心胸醫學院報吿稱，最新發明之「奇藥」——斯特萊普托密新，可醫治兩種肺癆病，即軍事肺癆（？）及小兒肺癆。」</p>
<p>讀了後不禁使人一笑。在這個「軍事第一」（並非安全第一）的世界上，竟有所謂軍事肺癆出現了，豈非好笑，那一定是譯者的筆誤。</p>
<p>原文是Milliary　Tuberculosis，這個字　Mliliary並非是Milityary，在其中相差了一個T字，這個字Miliary是英漢字典中所査不到的，牠是從拉丁文Miliaris這字所來的，解釋是黍的種子，形容其微小，而能構成無數的疾病。這一種TB在散佈的時候，可以攻擊身體中任何一個器官，甚至於腦子四周圍所遮着的膜。</p>
<p>所謂斯特萊普托密新，是治肺癆的奇藥，在過去的兩年中，已被試騐得很有成效了，有好幾百個患TB的病人已被治愈了，現在已開始在美國上市出售了。</p>
<p>斯特萊普托密新—Streptomycin是和配尼西林一個成份中出來的，所以也可以算是和配尼西林一家的，不過牠沒有配尼西林的成份來得複雜和有規則。</p>
<p>斯特萊普托密新治療普通的肺癆簡直是一種「奇藥」。在開始後幾個星期之內，有時候幾天之內，熱度就減退了，咳嗽停止了，胃口恢復了，他就開始增加體重了。他的唾液在顯微鏡下化騐出來，已經沒有TB菌了。X光的照片指示出來，肺部的TB黑點已經消失了。</p>
<p>根據「科學服務」的報告，有一個十九歲的少女生了能厲害的TB，影響到她頸部的淋巴腺，在三個月內，細菌攻擊到了那少女心臟四圍的膜，像生這樣重病的人在以前很少很少有人會繼續活着的，在往常簡直是不會痊愈的了。</p>
<p>斯特萊普托密新的治療五天後，高熱度開始減退了。根據她的醫生的話，她的症象，已「完全地和驚人地」消失了。曾經在她心臟旁流質中，在她的血液中一，以及在她的淋巴腺中發現過的細菌，也都消失了。五個月後，治療完成，那少女回到家中，復元了。</p>
<p>這裏有另外的一件事實，去年十月，一個護士學校的學生患了肺癆，她的體重滅輕了，時常覺得非常疲倦，並且開始咳嗽了，每天下午，她的體溫增加了。</p>
<p>在十一月，X光照片指示出她肺部有黑點，雖然她在床上靜養，但是病　越來越重了。在十二月十六日，X光指出來，在她的一隻肺部，已經有一個洞丁了。</p>
<p>在十二月十七日，斯特萊普托密新的治療開始了，一個月之後，那護士學生是痊愈了，　今年的一月廿一日如煙的X光片一。肺部已　沒有洞了。TB的菌的癥象也已沒有了，她已經恢復健康了。</p>
<p>另外的一件事實是一個廿三月了。X光照片顯出來，他的肺部有一個幾乎一英吋　的洞。</p>
<p>第天用斯特　普托密新治療，六個星期之後，X光照片上所　出來的，冠全是兩樣了。那洞已　沒有了，流質也乎冠全消失了，TB菌已經不再在他的身體中發現了，六個月之後，這一個報吿講出來——他仍舊在進步着——漸漸地在恢復日常行動了。</p>
<p>對於醫生們，斯特萊普托密新，這個字，在技術上講，並非是肺癆的「治療藥！」牠是一種制止細菌的藥，或即所謂殺菌劑。牠制止細菌的生長，制止細菌的攻擊身體，給身體一個復元的機會。</p>
<p>斯特萊普托密新並不是完完全全有效的，有時候，一個病人在復元的時候，情形突然會變壞的，在這種情形下，細菌便開始反抗了，於是，藥就不再有效力了。</p>
<p>這是斯特萊着托密新的研究者們認為最大的問題。這也是用配尼西林去治療肺癆一樣的會遇到這樣的問題的。醫學界正在進行試騐着一種新的藥呌做Grisein，一種和斯特萊普托密新有着密切關係的藥。醫生們希望當肺癆菌在反抗的時候，一種零外的藥進去，完成這件『治療」的工作。是否能成功，那要等着瞧了！</p>
<h3>名士孔融　—魏晉人物雜論之三</h3>
<p>— 冷周</p>
<p>魏晋文人，籠統地雖然都保有一種朗徹淸妍的作風，但細心研究時，却又可以從他們行止中分出了兩派：一派是看透了人世變幻，把日子消磨在酒藥山水之間，而任誕放縱，過他超然的生活；一派却掛羊頭買狗肉，堅起名士招牌，藉而聯羣結友，互相標榜，作為進身之階的。孔融就是後者一派的代表。</p>
<p>正如續後漢書所說：一融持論經典，不及讓等，而適才宏博過之。」所謂逸才，就是沒有根底的清談，魏志卷十二有一段很典型的記載：</p>
<p>「融初有異才，時河南尹李膺有重名，勒門下簡通賓客，非當世英賢及通家子孫，弗見也。融年十餘歲。欲觀其為人，遂造膺門，語門者曰：我李君通家也。膺見融問曰：高明父祖嘗與僕週旋乎？融曰：然！先君孔子與君先大人李老君同德比義，而相師友，則融與君，累世通家也。衆坐奇之。太中大夫陳諱後至，同坐以吿諱，諱日：人少時了了者，大亦未必奇也，融答曰：即如所言，君之幼時豈實慧乎？膺大笑，顧謂曰：高明長大必為偉器。」</p>
<p>從這裏，可見孔融勾結豪貴，善逞口舌的工夫了。不過，當時他雖把個陳諱駁倒，伹事後證明，陳諱對他的批評都是十分正確的，這不祇見於他不但不能成為「偉器」，反而給曹操以「遠天反道，敗倫亂理」的罪名推出斬首，不得善終，據司馬彪九洲春秋：</p>
<p>「融在北海，自許大志，結植根本，不肯碌碌如平。然其所任用，好奇取異，皆輕剽之才·至於稽古之士，謬為恭敬，禮之雖備，不與論國事也。…高談敎令，盈溢官曹，辭氣溫雅可愛，而誦論事考，實難可悉行。」</p>
<p>把他這麼一個好裝門面而不務實際，嘴里說得好聽，而做起來却是一個膿包的性格，刻劃得淸淸楚楚了。但這還是不够的，陳壽三國志里還有幾段很精彩的補充：</p>
<p>『…黃市將至，融大飲醇酒，躬自上馬，禦之淶水之上，寇令上部與融相拒，兩翼經涉水直到所沿城，城潰，融不得入。…城為袁置所攻，自春　夏，城小寇衆，流矢雨集，然融憑儿安坐，讀書議論自若。城城衆亡，身奔山東，家室為譚所虜。」</p>
<p>要是不看下文，單紙講他開局的作風，實在　有介事，先擊奪人的。可是兩次結果都是一樣，兩次都一敗塗地。風大雷聲小，孔殲時大槪就靠這種架子，滿以為可以嚇退敵人的吧？</p>
<p>大飮　酒，　然上馬，這豪風是値得人贊許的；臨危鎭定，從容應變，這修養是値得人敬佩的；但這却要有個前題，就是衆敵而敵退，應變而變解，不然，打腫臉孔裝胖子，說得好聽一點，就是優氣，而其實呢’何嘗不是如抱朴子漢過肅里的：「令色警戀，有貌無心者，謂之擬神明徹；利口小辯，希指巧言者，謂之標領淸妍；結黨合譽，行與口違者，謂之以為會友；仰賴强親，位過其才者，謂之四豪之匹。」這幾個謂之謂之的，拆穿來不値一文錢吧了，名士云乎哉？</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽</p>
<p>美國的郵政</p>
<p>我對於美國郵政辦理之善，不但是佩服，間直是崇拜，因為我是經常在遷移中的，平均每月遷移一次。戰時從成都來的信，經昆明，印度，非洲轉遞，最快兩個月，轉來轉去，要三個月才可收到，但五年內從來不會遺漏一封信。美國小城市有許多同名的，例如格倫畫爾Glenale就有好幾個，來信不書明省份，結果先寄到加列福尼亞省的格倫寶爾，終于轉到阿利桑那省的格倫寶爾，當信寄到時，我已換了好幾個地方，信老是跟着我追，郵局對於每個離埠的軍人都留一個通訊處，往往一封信轉了幾十個地方，仍舊會送到收信人的手中，決不像中國內地郵局把無法投遞的信付之一炬，（編者按：事實上也並不完全如此）實際恐怕郵政當局根本就懶得去追踵收信人。</p>
<p>在美國可將美金票封入信中貼三分郵票寄去，鑽戒也可當包裹寄出，不需掛號，包無遺失或調換之虞，衣箱交郵局轉運，可運鑰匙交給郵局，你衣箱裏的服裝，決不會變成瓦片，可是你在美國寄信或包裹到中國，千萬得掛號，否則信到了中國，因為有人看中了信封上的美國郵票，所以連信都燬了，如果寄包裹的話，那你的包裹會被人刧收。我自美國寄十幾件包裹到成都，結果祇有西藥一匣在我返國之後寄到，原來那西藥早已失了時效，不値分文，可是我去提取時，反而貼去郵票多元，關稅不貲。（十四）</p>
<h3>朱惺公的遺族</h3>
<p>— 王點</p>
<p>抗戰期中，報人在敵偽威脅利誘下因不屈而殉難的很多，朱惺公即是其中的一個。</p>
<p>當上海滿為孤島時，朱惺公正在美商大美晚報任夜光副刋編輯。環境雖然惡劣，但他仍不顧險難，盡力暴露敵偽陰謀，以汪逆精衛比之為南宋時賣國求榮的魯王，因此遭了敵偽的猜忌，而受到了卑汚無恥的狙擊。</p>
<p>先是汪逆的把兄張某，出面邀朱惺公任某偽報編輯，聲言待遇優厚，每週僅擬撰擁護敵偽之文字一篇，朱惺公非但堅拒了，而且更著論痛斥，汪逆及其爪牙見利誘不遂，即繼之以威脅。除了先後接到三封恐嚇信外，張某又假意邀朱惺公赴宴，作陪者均為偽軍軍官。席散的時候，張某忽向朱惺公要一張結婚照片，朱惺公當時就答應了。</p>
<p>待他回到家裏，與夫人親明之後，就覺到事情頗有些蹊蹺，但旣經允諾，自不能失信於人，而且在當時的情形下，明知這是陰謀，但也不由你圖賴。在幾經商量之後，決定把他自己的一張照片送給了張某。</p>
<p>二十八年八月三十一日下午四時。朱惺公與往日一樣，照例載上他的玳瑁邊眼鏡，拿了剛寫成的稿件，搭電車上大美晚報云了，可是未及半小時，竟被暴是狙擊，子彈穿入右太陽穴，在電車站殉難了。</p>
<p>朱惺公的夫人現住杭州，與筆者為鄰居，上面所述，都是未夫人親口吿訴筆者的。如今死的固然死了·而活着的却落進了困厄之中。在杭州的家中，除了果夫人自己外·尙有一個今年方　五歲的孩子，名庸雍，現肆棄於上海新陸師範。朱夫人自從丈夫殉難以後，因依仗無人，心神頗為頹唐，每日茹素佞佛，渡其寂寞歲月。惟處此物價高漲之情形下，兒子的讀書雖由公費供給，但衣服另用，以及她自己的一自三餐，却難以維持。故不得不最些糊火柴匣一類的手工，來貼補些一家用，情景是凄慘的。</p>
<p>政府為褒揚忠貞殉難的報人，一次發給卹金三萬元，聽說到今天尙未領得。即使拿到了這三萬塊錢，也還買不到一斗白米。朱夫人係次談起這件事，熱淚總是奪眶而出。她說丈夫為國家殉了難，而國家却把遺族的生活忘記了。這是極其滿心的言語。</p>
<p>看到朱惺公遺族的生活情形，也可也想像到其他殉難報人的遺族，政府如果要安定遺族的生活，使遺族沒有半點怨尤，那麼對於給卹這一點，應有重行考慮的必要。至少要使遺族好好的過日子，讓殉難的志士也可以在九泉之下瞑目。</p>
<h3>幽默雜記</h3>
<p>— 公𢏫</p>
<p>適得其反</p>
<p>老張到寫字間面帶怒容。他的同事覺得很奇怪，便問他道，「今天早晨為什麼這樣不痛快？」</p>
<p>「噢，沒有什麽」他回答說，「我不過用保險剃刀割破了我的手，安全火柴燒了我的衣服，當我看一張「行車安全第一』的標語時，我幾乎　　死！』</p>
<h3>北極素描</h3>
<p>— 溥倫</p>
<p>展開地圖，我們可以看見東西兩大半球在地球上兩極端的距離是很接近的；同時我們更可以看見地球上的大陸多半分佈在北半球，使北極成為大陸與大陸之間的交通孔道。許多年前以至現在，有不少夢想家和探險家帶着非常濃厚的科學興味作兩極的探險。</p>
<p>北極的歷史是短暫的而且是簡單的，最初開發北極的是希臘支系的彼蒂亞斯（Pytheas）人，他們到達了挪威的北部；時間在紀元前三二五年。在那裏，他們證明了一個寒冷，又永遠沒有太陽而成年結冰的事實。其次可以査考的是諾爾斯曼人；其次是英國人；再來的俄羅斯入和美國人。那時的英國要從那裏去尋覓一條到中國貿易的道路；他們許多水手，捕鯨者和開發家，才把北極畫出了一個輪廓來：北極好像一隻大碗形的海，它把歐洲，亞洲，和北美洲的大陸的邊緣銜接起來。</p>
<p>雖然北極洋有着五兆噸的冰，而且在西伯利亞的溫度在九十度以下，但寒冷的北極並不像我們所像想的那麽寒冷。依照極地專家Hubert　Wilkins所叙述的，北極在最熱季節的平均溫度，是華氏五十度以下。當眞，北極的夏天，是相當舒適的。除了達柯塔（Dakta）北部地區之外，北極大部地方是溫暖的，甚至連冬天都差不了許多；而且很少發生颶風。同時所下的雪亦不多；有些時候，一年祇得九呎厚的雪。在北極，和其他南方地方一樣，常常下雨。在西伯利亞的北部，楊梅長得和李子一般大。甚至蘇聯科學界還有一個植物學家Tsitsim敎授，曾發現一種新種子能够在北極生長。</p>
<p>北極的天然資源是非常豐富的，雖然在數量上尙未有精確的統計，但工業主要的原料蘊藏着許多種類。</p>
<p>屬於美國地帶者，阿拉斯加中部有着已經開墾得很有成績的農田。一些世界最好的農田，是屬於加拿大北部的大斯拉湄湖（Greatl　Slave　Lakc）的報部，但大部還沒有將墾。阿拉斯加還有無數方哩的土地沒有人居住，它的面積比紐約州要大十二倍，但總人口只有八萬人，而白種人亦只有三萬三千人。</p>
<p>北極地區亦同樣有着不可勝計的地方，生長着那高大茂盛的尙未砍掉的樹木；各種各樣的島類，和無數的野獸。而北極洋的水盪漾地流着，裏面產生着不少的魚類，甚至有鯨魚。</p>
<p>至於軍事上的鑛類，更用不着說了。北美洲的天然資源包括着阿拉斯加的金鐵，和一個世界最大的銅鑛北美洲地帶亦同樣有着鐳鑛和煤鑛，而煤鑛中的一部份可能是油田，在加拿大，重要的資源是鐳和鈾。蘇聯地帶有着　富的煤鑛，和油田。挪利爾斯克（Noriisk）有銅鑛和　鑛；而利拿（Lena）有金鎭，如果蘇聯事在北極獲得鐳鑛，那就更可觀了。</p>
<p>北極的東部，差不多完全屬於蘇聯地帶的。俄羅斯人自凱撤時代以來，即以科學的方法開發這些地方的地上資源。他們希望蘇聯的北極能够自給。若干年前，蘇聯老是站在美國的前頭；去開發北極。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, Eighth of the Month] The center of the war in the Yimeng Mountains has moved south, and the war situation in southern Shandong is becoming tense. Communist bandits, with more than thirteen columns comprising eight columns, are fleeing towards the mountainous area north of Mengshan, near Linyi. The Communist Fourth Column and the Independent Thirteenth Division, totaling over 20,000 troops, fiercely attacked Feixian on the night of the 4th, engaging in fierce battles for three days and nights. By 10:00 AM on the 7th, the defending forces, having achieved their mission of annihilating the Communist bandits, transferred to advantageous positions in the suburbs.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qingdao, Eighth of the Month] The National Army, after capturing Jiaoxian, continued to advance westward, engaging in fierce battles on both sides of Yaogezhuang. Under the cover of artillery fire, the National Army successfully crossed the river, repelling the Communist troops, and in one fell swoop, captured Dali, located ten li east of Gaomi city, before swiftly entering the county seat. On the morning of the 8th, the National Army completely captured Gaomi. The iron bridge between Jiaoxian and Lancun has been destroyed and is currently being repaired with a temporary bridge. Traffic between Qingdao and Gaomi is expected to resume soon.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, Eighth of the Month] More than 20,000 Communist troops from the Tusikou area suddenly harassed Tai'an on the evening of the 7th, and fierce battles are currently raging in the suburbs.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, Eighth of the Month] On the 8th, the National Army in the Yimeng Mountains continued to make smooth progress, with extremely fierce fighting in Yishui. The Communist troops who fiercely attacked Shankouzhai east of Tai'an on the 7th were still engaged in intense fighting as of the evening of the 8th. For several days, Communist troops have been shifting and fleeing from the Zibo and Bo areas towards the outskirts of Jinan. The number of Communist troops on the outskirts of Jinan has now increased to approximately 50,000, comprising three columns. The National Army has taken strict precautions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou, Eighth of the Month] After inflicting damage on a Communist division, the National Army in Yuncheng conducted a strategic withdrawal on the evening of the 7th. The battle for the defense of Heze city is still proceeding fiercely. Of the eight Communist columns in the southern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains, one column has broken through and fled north to the Tusikou area in central Shandong. The Sixth Column, which originally fled near Sishui in an attempt to join forces with Liu Bocheng's troops, suffered a severe defeat by the powerful National Army. On the evening of the 7th, it occupied Donglidian, while the remaining six columns, surrounded by the National Army in Feixian and the Tangtou, Qinglongsi, and Niuzhuang areas north of Linyi, are facing difficulties breaking through due to their excessively long supply lines. According to judgments by experienced military strategists, their main force will inevitably be completely annihilated within a very short period.</p>

<h3>Fuxin Coal Mine Machinery Removed to Safe Areas</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Eighth of the Month] Important machinery from the Fuxin coal mine in Rehe has been dismantled and transferred to safe areas such as Jinzhou, and a large quantity has already been shipped out. Since the situation in the Northeast became tense, many important industrial areas have suffered significant damage. Last week, Beipiao was lost, and the Fuxin coal mine not only had its power supply cut off, but its position was also threatened. Therefore, the mining authorities, in addition to requesting the government to send troops for protection, also dismantled and relocated machinery so that even if the mining area is lost, recovery will be easier in the future.</p>
<h3>Coking Expert Yu Zailin Shot and Killed by Bandits in Beipiao</h3>

<h3>The Chinese Communists Steal National Territory and Hinder Reconstruction Work</h3>
<p>Chen Wenyuan Speaks at a Revival Meeting</p>
<p>[United Press, Welland, Ontario, Canada, Seventh of the Month] Chen Wenyuan, honorary president of the Chinese Christian Association and pastor of the Methodist Church, stated here today at the International Revival Meeting: "The Chinese Communists are now accelerating the political and economic collapse of China, and all hope for reconciliation between the Nationalists and the Communists has been destroyed. After the Japanese army withdrew, the Chinese Communists stole national territory and then engaged in constant conflicts with the National Army, so that relief and reconstruction work could not be carried out. Prices have soared for a long time, and the end result is unimaginable. It is not too much to say that China is on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition to the economic depression, morality is also declining, which is another result of the war. The black market is rampant, and the practice of hoarding and corruption is prevalent. Political disunity, especially the dispute between the Nationalists and the Communists, is a cause of deep concern for the people of the whole country. Reconciliation between the Nationalists and the Communists is hopeless. The Chinese Communists are now inciting unrest and disrupting transportation. The aim of the Nationalist Party is to emulate Britain and the United States and establish a democratic government, while the aim of the Communist Party is to Sovietize China. Although the Communist Party has claimed to value democracy, its so-called democracy is only a tool to achieve its goals."</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders the Ministry of National Defense to Issue Dragon Boat Festival慰勞金</h3>

<h3>Control Yuan Members File Impeachment Case Against Wang Shijie for Weak Diplomacy Towards the Soviet Union; President Yu Assigns Eight Members to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] More than ten Control Yuan members believe that Foreign Minister Wang has been too weak in handling diplomatic affairs with the Soviet Union, such as the Baitashan incident, the reception of Lushun and Dalian, and the dismantling of Northeast resources by the Soviet army. He has often failed to negotiate with the other party in accordance with the independent and autonomous diplomatic principles based on international law. They filed an impeachment case on the 7th, impeaching Wang's various negligent acts. After the case was submitted to President Yu, it was decided that eight members, including Bai Rui, would review it. Once the review is established, it can be formally established. In addition, many Control Yuan members have proposed a suggestion to start the work of training and demarcating the borders of Inner and Outer Mongolia as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Discusses Mobilization Plan; Several People Appointed to Draft Implementation Outline; Grain徵收Method Still Needs Further Discussion</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The National General Mobilization Plan was reported and discussed at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 8th. At the same time, the General Mobilization Law promulgated during the war was submitted for research. Some people argued that the method was too flexible and should be amended or a new method should be drafted. However, others believed that the first article of the method stated that there were "Resistance War and Nation Building" characters. Although it is not currently a resistance war, nation building is one, so they believe that it is not necessary to amend it. It was then decided to convene a temporary meeting for discussion, and several people were appointed to draft an implementation outline, which focused on several items such as grain徵收, conscription, refreshing local politics, sorting out finances, and protecting the basic freedoms of the people and not hindering the implementation of the constitution.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The grain徵收problem was raised for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 8th. The 徵收volume passed by the subcommittee on the 7th was 60 million dan, but the full amount was 40 million dan. The methods were徵收、借 and purchasing with the tax. After careful discussion, it was believed that borrowing was not as good as徵收, because it may not be returned after borrowing, so it is better to handle all of it by徵收. At the same time, the procedures for purchasing with the tax may be inappropriate, and it was decided that it was necessary to raise it for discussion again, and no results were obtained today.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The meeting convened by Wang Yunwu of the Executive Yuan to discuss the methods of the General Mobilization Plan has been held three times. However, due to too many detailed problems, it is impossible to decide for a while. The grain徵收method has already been submitted for discussion, and the topic of refreshing local politics is being discussed.</p>
<p>Economic Reform Plan to be Completely Reviewed</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The National Economic Commission will hold another plenary review meeting on the 9th to study the economic reform plan. If the case can be reviewed and completed on the 9th, it will be completely reviewed at the general meeting on the 10th. In addition, the industrial group held a meeting on the 8th and revised the industrial chapter in accordance with the first phase of the economic construction plan and the industrial construction outline. According to informed sources, the economic reform plan will be a permanent plan, and the original plan will not have major changes. The National Economic Commission will make a complete review of the case based on the opinions of each group when it opens on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] A senior official of the Ministry of Finance said: The so-called strengthening of economic control is to restore some of the wartime measures in view of the current situation. At the same time, under certain circumstances, various temporary laws and regulations can be promulgated. Which ones should be restored urgently will be decided after a comprehensive plan.</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan is Drafting a Peace Treaty with Japan; the Theme is to Eliminate Aggression; Sino-Soviet Relations Must Depend on Future Actions of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Wang Chonghui Answers Questions on Domestic and International Situation [Report from this newspaper] A reporter visited Minister Wang Chonghui yesterday to inquire about the domestic and international situation. He answered separately as follows: (1) The government's mobilization to suppress bandits is a necessary move at the moment. In the past, the government hoped that domestic problems could be resolved peacefully, so it did not hesitate to make concessions repeatedly. Even if it used force, it hoped to achieve political goals through military means. Today, the situation has changed, and the Communist Party has clearly expressed its intention to overthrow the government, so the government has no other way but to suppress bandits in an all-round way. I believe that the whole country should understand that this move is a battle for the life and death of our country, distinguish right from wrong, and all sectors of society should assist the government with all their strength, so that the war can be ended as soon as possible (2) The issue of the peace treaty with Japan has been under study during the war. The Executive Yuan is currently drafting it. The content focuses on disarmament, compensation, and immigration policies. From our country's point of view, the greatest purpose of the peace treaty with Japan is to reduce Japan's ability to aggress. Before the war, Japan's immigration, 無一 non-略's precursor, all of which must be eliminated. However, our country does not intend to adopt revenge, and allows Japan to be economically self-reliant and survive. This position, the chairman has repeatedly stated, is our country's consistent benevolent style. (3) In diplomacy, our country's position on the Soviet Union has not changed, and the relationship between the two countries has become clearer. How the relationship between the two countries will develop in the future must depend on the future actions of the Soviet side, and it is not appropriate to make malicious predictions at this time. People from both countries should remember that the Sino-Soviet relationship is the biggest key to peace in the Far East. At the same time, the biggest goal of China's Anti-Japanese War was to recover the Northeast, and today the situation in the Northeast is extremely serious.</p>
<h3>The Youth Corps Celebrates its Ninth Anniversary; Chen Cheng Tells the Youth of the Nation to Recognize Defiance and Exert Themselves to Suppress Bandits and Build the Nation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The ninth anniversary of the founding of the Kuomintang Youth Corps falls on the 9th. Chen Cheng, Secretary-General of the Central Corps, specially issued a letter to the youth of the nation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Communist Bandits Expand Rebellion; It Relies on the Struggle of the Youth</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Corps, it has been nine years in a flash. In the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the revolutionary youth of the whole country, under the great call and leadership of the head of the Corps, concentrated revolutionary new forces, enthusiastically participated in all wartime work, and have made their indelible contribution. Although the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the Communist bandits are expanding their full-scale rebellion, endangering the unity and security of the country and the nation. There are still many places where we rely on the continued struggle of our young comrades. The head of the Corps has even more expectations for our youth. The recent "July 7th" broadcast was full of exhortations. I think the youth of the whole country have all listened. Today, when celebrating the ninth anniversary of the Corps, I will restate its meaning and its daily instructions for mutual encouragement</p>
<p>If the Rebellion is not Suppressed, the Country will be Forfeited</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Corps's birth, its purpose was to achieve the success of the Anti-Japanese War and nation-building. Now that the Communist Party has a "incorrigible bandit nature" and has no sincere intention to repent, it has recently intensified its efforts, not hesitating to sell out the motherland, use Korean Communists and Japanese prisoners of war, and slaughter compatriots. Its deliberate intention to subvert the country by violence and harm the world has been extremely clear. If we cannot unite as a country, be determined, and suppress the rebellion, then not only will the people's livelihood become increasingly desolate, but the entire country will be forfeited. Our government, in order to consolidate national unity, protect the survival of the nation, and save the people in the bandit areas, has issued an order to mobilize the whole country and intensify the suppression of the rebellion. I hope that the revolutionary youth of the whole country, under the leadership of the head of the Corps, will distinguish right from wrong, recognize obedience and respect, abide by national laws, implement general mobilization, and strive together for saving the country and the people.</p>
<p>Feudal Remnants are Corrupt; Must be Eliminated at the Same Time</p>
<p>Second: In addition to the above-mentioned deterioration of the Communist bandits, the enemy we are currently facing also includes corrupt forces such as feudal remnants, which must also be eliminated at the same time, and then the revolutionary camp can be rectified. According to the daily instructions of the head of the Corps, the progress of our country's revolution can be divided into two phases. Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was the first phase of the revolution, the purpose of which was to strive for the survival of the country and the nation, the object of which was the foreign imperialists and the domestic warlords, and the central task of which was to implement nationalism, which was the period of military administration. From the Northern Expedition to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, domestic warlords have been eliminated, and Japanese imperialists have also been defeated. It can be said that nationalism has been largely completed. Therefore, with the defeat of Japan, the first phase of the revolution ended, and the later phase of the revolution began at the same time. The purpose of the later phase of the revolution is to build a new China of the Three People's Principles, to protect the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, to consolidate the security of the country and the nation, and to maintain world peace. Its central task is to implement democracy and people's livelihood, which is the period of transition from political tutelage to constitutional government. The object is the Communist bandits and feudal remnants. These feudal remnants, taking advantage of opportunities, manipulating prices, and disrupting finance, not only deepen the economic crisis, but also reduce the government's prestige, so that the Communist bandits can take the opportunity to carry out their malicious propaganda. It is no different from helping the spread of the Communist bandits. Although the Communist bandits will liquidate them everywhere first, if they do not realize it as soon as possible, then our revolutionary camp can no longer allow them to exist. Our country has previously unveiled three tasks, which should be vigorously implemented.</p>
<p>Deeply Recognize the Unity and Transformation of the Party and the Country, and Strengthen Unity</p>
<p>Third: As mentioned above, today's national affairs are becoming increasingly difficult due to the rebellion of the Communist bandits, and there are still feudal remnants in our revolutionary camp. The head of the Corps, with foresight and vision, has recently given clear instructions that the Party must be in harmony and merge, and be thoroughly transformed. The Party can then unify its leadership and concentrate its forces to cooperate with the policy of suppressing bandits. All our comrades must deeply recognize that the unity and transformation of the Party and the Corps this time is to adapt to the needs of the revolutionary stage, and it is also a good opportunity for the Party and the Corps to be reborn. We must not be deceived by the Communist bandits' divisive propaganda and lose our confidence, nor can we suspect each other and disrupt our steps. We must donate prejudices, unite sincerely, promote the spirit of the Party's previous reorganizations, absolutely believe in the head of the Corps, and obey his orders, so that under the leadership of the head of the Corps, we can move towards the road of rebirth. The transformation plan is now being researched and allocated by the responsible comrades of the Party and the Corps. During this period, our comrades at all levels should especially abide by discipline, do their best, and be consistent, and not be lazy.</p>
<p>Revolutionary youth of the whole country, youth are the vanguard of the revolution and the new life of the country. At this critical juncture of the revolution, it is a good opportunity for young patriots to be loyal to the country. We hope that all will rise up together, actively strive, strengthen the strength of suppressing bandits, and eliminate the Red scourge as soon as possible, so as to complete the Six Industries of revolutionary nation-building.</p>
<h3>Do We Need American Loans? - Dr. Wei Tingsheng's Speech in Shanghai Last Night -</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Lixing Fellowship Society of this city held its second academic lecture at the Bank of China on the fourth floor last night at 8:00 PM, inviting Legislative Yuan member Dr. Wei Tingsheng to speak on "Do We Need American Loans?". Mr. Wei is a well-known economic expert, and he believes that the attitude towards borrowing should be: borrowing is certainly welcome, but the problem must still be solved proactively by ourselves, and we cannot rely on other countries. In other words, if the United States is willing to help, the problem can be solved faster, but if it is not willing to help, the problem must still be solved. He analyzed that the so-called problem has two parts, one is emergency relief, that is, how to overcome the difficulties, and the other is nation-building, that is, how to carry out construction. First, let's talk about nation-building. Not only is foreign borrowing needed, but we should also use various methods to absorb large-scale foreign investment as much as possible, and use their highly developed technology and excellent talents to help us build. It is like fishing; it is using other people's nets to catch our fish. It would be foolish to refuse to borrow. As for emergency relief, it is undeniable that inflation has reached a very dangerous point. The past two years can be said to be two unfortunate years in history. Today, the crux of all financial, economic, and political problems is due to the imbalance between income and expenditure, but even without American loans, the problem is not necessarily unsolvable. Mr. Wei was summoned by Chairman Chiang to present his views and had several face-to-face talks with President Zhang Qun. He believes that the way to balance income and expenditure lies in (1) rectifying tax collection and opening up new tax sources. Some people think that we should not talk about increasing taxes at this time of economic depression, but he believes that, like treating a disease, the sweat should still come from the patient. (2) Selling state assets, privatizing the income from takeovers and unnecessary state-owned enterprises as much as possible; and ○ changing foreign exchange and financial policies, abolishing foreign exchange controls, and automatically adjusting exchange rates with prices to encourage exports, increase production, and absorb term deposits. And the most effective emergency measure is (4) cultivating financial credit and issuing short-term public bonds to absorb idle funds. At present, the number of people holding idle funds is extremely large, and they are suffering from a lack of investment channels. If the government can give them high profits and show great faith, the people will be happy to buy them. If this principle is implemented and there are no technical problems, financial income and expenditure can definitely be balanced. Finally, Mr. Wei also investigated the reason why the United States has been hesitant to grant loans. It is because the situation in China has not been clarified. The Americans will only help China in two situations: either the Communist Party cooperates with the government, or the Communist Party is eliminated. Facts have proven in the past two years that the Communist Party is a party that destroys humanity and is only a tool of a certain ethnic imperialism. Its purpose is entirely to overthrow the Republic of China, so the government has no choice but to take the path of suppressing the rebellion. At this time of hardship, the people of the whole country must not stand by and entrust the heavy responsibility to Chairman Chiang alone, but must support the government, show it with facts, and actively purchase public bonds to improve the country's situation. In this way, foreign aid will definitely follow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] The Minister to China of the U.S. Embassy, ​​Walters, is expected to arrive here this Wednesday or Thursday. He is returning to the country at the request of Marshall for consultation. Walters' return to Washington at this time has increased the importance of his mission because of the recent decision of our government to engage in full-scale war. Well-informed sources believe that Walters' trip does not necessarily mean that there will be any drastic changes in the U.S. policy toward China. Walters will immediately report all well-informed information to Marshall after arriving here. Although the New York Times has published information about Walters' meetings with Premier Zhang Qun and Mr. Soong Tzu-wen before leaving China, the State Department has not yet received any formal reports. Other sources said that Walters' return to Washington is timely because since Marshall returned to the United States in January this year, Walters is the first senior American official to report directly to him.</p>
<p>Marshall Focuses on China Problem</p>
<p>Walters May Arrive in Washington Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall turned his attention to the China issue on the 7th and met with Li Daming, a member of the Executive Yuan of China (Standing Committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party). Li had come here from Honolulu. According to officials after the meeting, the two discussed various current issues in China.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 7th] A representative of the Export-Import Bank said: The Chinese government has requested the Export-Import Bank to provide loans for various reconstruction works, such as building ports and railways, developing chemicals, mining, and fertilizer industries. However, the Chinese government has not proposed the amount of the loan. This is China's first loan application in fourteen months. The Export-Import Bank will carefully study the Chinese government's plan.</p>

<h3>Japanese War Criminal Isoya on Trial. Court Hearing Focuses on Crimes in Hong Kong. No Verdict Yesterday, Debate to Continue Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Japanese war criminal Rentaro Isoya was publicly tried on the morning of the 8th in the temporary war crimes tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense in the auditorium of the Lixing Society Headquarters. Isoya is the third Japanese war criminal to be tried. His crimes focused on Hong Kong. In addition to condoning his subordinates to burn, kill, rape, and plunder, he also implemented a policy of "Japanization" in Hong Kong. The court adjourned at 12:00 noon, and the trial continued in the afternoon. The trial has not yet been completed and will continue today for debate.</p>
<h3>Condoned Subordinate Rape and Murder, Tried to Evade Responsibility but Presented No Evidence to Refute Charges</h3>
<p>Isoya is taller than the two demons of Jiu Binglong and Gu Shifu. He wore a military uniform and carried a coffee-colored felt hat and a cloth bag containing documents when he entered the court. He looked very calm. At 9:00 AM, Judge Shi Meiyu and the prosecutors and clerks ascended the court. First, Judge Shi asked his name, origin, and age. He replied that he was from Tokyo, Japan, 64 years old, living in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, and had served as commander of the 10th Division, Governor of Hong Kong, and Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. The prosecutor then read out the indictment, and the translator translated it into Japanese. Isoya listened intently.</p>
<p>At 9:45, the indictment was read out, and Judge Shi announced that the prosecutor had charged the defendant with (1) crimes against peace, (2) war crimes, and (3) crimes against humanity. He then asked the defendant about his duties after graduating from the Army University. Isoya replied that he had served as an attaché to the General Staff Headquarters, as a section chief in the Directorate General of Education, and in the Army Ministry. He also served as a staff officer in Shanghai for two years and as a battalion commander in Hiroshima from 1920 to 1923. From 1925 to 1929, he was a regimental commander for seven years, and later transferred to the personnel section chief of the Japanese Army Ministry. These positions were unrelated to the Sino-Japanese War. He only served as a military attaché at the Shanghai Consulate General from 1931 to 1932, and then served as a staff officer in the Kwantung Army. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was appointed as the Governor of Hong Kong. After Isoya finished answering, the judge immediately questioned the mission of the Kwantung Army and the position held by the defendant during the July 7th Incident. Isoya said that the Kwantung Army was responsible for defending "Manchukuo" and was not trying to create a "Manchukuo". At the beginning of the July 7th Incident, he was the commander of the 10th Division. At the end of August of that year, he landed in Dagu and went south along the Jinpu Line with all his strength at the end of September, reaching Yanzhou at the end of December. At this point, Judge Shi announced his criminal acts, including: rape and murder by Isoya's subordinates in Taian County, Shandong, robbery and murder in Meng County, Henan, robbery in Boa'ai County, etc., and presented evidence of women being gang-raped to death. Isoya denied all of them and did not present any evidence to refute the charges. He also deliberately confused the time, such as "1937", "Republic of China 26th Year", "Showa 1st Year", etc., and said that the defendant was ordered to come to China to fight, and all actions were carried out under orders and there were no illegal incidents.</p>
<p>At this point, the investigation of the war crimes portion was completed, and then the section on the poisoning of Hong Kong began. Isoya was in Hong Kong from 1942 until he resigned in December 1944. Regarding the poisoning portion, the combined ban on drugs and public assets, he argued that the "gradual reduction method" was adopted, using Taiwan's ten-year ban as a precedent. At the same time, he called Ogasawara Ao to testify. Ogasawara Ao only stated that 5 million taels of opium were distributed to East Asia, and not specifically to Hong Kong. At the same time, it was also a method to completely ban it. The entire statement was a sophistry to obliterate the facts. By this time it was 12:00 noon, and the court adjourned to continue the trial in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Deported Civilians in Hong Kong, Admitted in Preliminary Hearing But Denied Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The court continued at 4:45 PM, and the questioning focused on the defendant's various crimes in Hong Kong. The court first questioned Isoya: Since Noma Kenzo, the commander of the Hong Kong Military Police, was the defendant's subordinate and often went to the Governor's Office to report on his work, he must have known about the torture and illegal arrest of civilians. Isoya replied that he knew nothing about it. The commander of the Military Police was not a member of the Governor's Office and did not need to report directly unless there was an important matter. Moreover, he only reported once a month, or even once every two months. Therefore, he knew nothing about the illegal acts committed. The court immediately retorted: As the superior, you are responsible for the crimes committed by your subordinates. It also presented the evidence of 38 people who were tortured, submitted by the Southeast Asia Allied Forces Investigation Team. After reading it, the defendant argued that such illegal acts should be the responsibility of the person in charge of such duties. During his tenure as governor, he did strictly prohibit his subordinates from doing evil. He really did not hear about such illegal acts during his tenure. Otherwise, he would have dealt with them strictly. He asked himself that he had done his best to prevent such acts. The court asked whether he could present any evidence to prove that he had done his duty. Isoya said that it was not with him, but he could retrieve it from Tokyo.</p>
<p>The court then questioned the matter of deporting civilians in Hong Kong. The defendant had already admitted this in the preliminary hearing, but when the order was executed, was it done verbally or in writing? Isoya argued: He had not admitted it in the past. There was no such thing as deporting civilians. It was only for the sake of protecting the order of the majority of the people that he had deported criminals three times. After submitting it to his superiors for approval, he verbally ordered the People's Food Department and the Military Police to carry out the order. The court then presented the record of the preliminary hearing on April 21, saying that he had admitted to deporting civilians and had issued orders in the name of the governor. Why did he deny it again? The defendant sophistically claimed that there was a recording error and he had never admitted it. The court then said: In the preliminary hearing, he confessed that he had done this because of the lack of food in Hong Kong. Why is he now contradicting himself? The defendant argued that this was a mistake, with 400,000 people voluntarily returning to their hometowns. Deportation and evacuation cannot be discussed in the same breath. The court then asked: According to reports, as many as 400,000 people were deported to Dapeng Bay at that time. Is this true? At this point, the defendant laughed and said: There is absolutely no such large number. At that time, only four batches of criminals were deported, and each ship carried about 500 people, for a total of only about 2,000 people four times. The so-called 400,000 people probably refer to evacuated people. The court then presented the evidence presented by the Englishman Omensi, stating that from June to December 1941, as many as 500 to 700 innocent people deported to Dapeng Bay died each month. After the defendant asked about the identity of the person, he sophistically claimed that the evidence was absolutely unreliable. The court then showed the evidence of the Chinese representative Luo Xuhuo and nine others, stating that they had met with the Governor of Hong Kong to protest the deportation of civilians but were not allowed to do so. The defendant again argued: In the end, he did not see these representatives. He also made a big statement, saying: When he was sent to Hong Kong to be the Governor, he had the belief of respecting Chinese etiquette, so after arriving in Hong Kong, he tried his best to respect the opinions of the Chinese, and was strongly opposed by people in the country. By the time it was 7:00 PM, the defendant still wanted to argue endlessly. The court ordered that the debate court would continue on the 9th, and he could make further statements at that time. The court then adjourned.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Headquarters Urgent Aid for Guangdong Disaster, Decided to Allocate 10,000 Tons of Rice and 500 Million Yuan in Cash, and Ordered UNRRA Guangdong Office to Extend Closing Date</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Publicly Commemorates Yang Guangzheng and Other Martyrs, Foreign Minister Wang Painfully Narrates Japan's Disregard for Humanity</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The remains of Yang Guangzheng, the late Consul General in Manila, Che Zhuo Huanlai, the late Consul in Sandakan, and the martyrs who died in the Manila Consulate General, Cao Jieen, Zhu Shaoping, Yao Zhuxiu, Yang Qingshou, Xiao Dongming, Lu Bingzhu, Wang Gongwei, etc., were publicly commemorated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the China Funeral Home at 3:00 PM on the 8th. The memorial service will be held by all sectors of the society at the Jingzhong Martyr Cemetery in Beijing on September 3rd, Victory Memorial Day. The public memorial ceremony of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon was presided over by Minister Wang Shijie, and more than 300 government leaders, including President Yu Youren, President Zhang Qun, Vice President Wu Tiecheng, and Secretary-General Gan Naiguang, attended the public memorial service. The mother of the late Consul General Yang, his sister Yang Liling, his brother Yang Xianyu, the mother of the late Consul Che, his sisters Zhou Lai, Yuan Lai, his brother Qing Lai, the brother of the late Consul Zhu, Bao Fen, his son Tongsheng, the wife of the late Attached Consul Yao, Yang Xizhen, the wife of the late Clerk Dian, Qiu Tianyou, and the brother of the late Trainee Wang, Gongying, all paid their respects in the mourning hall and accompanied the sacrifice.</p>
<p>In the public memorial service, Foreign Minister Wang made the following speech on the martyrdom of Yang and others: Consul General Yang Guangzheng and nine others were envoys of the Republic of China stationed abroad at that time. Although China and Japan were enemy countries at that time, the killing of envoys of enemy countries was not allowed by the customs of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. The Japanese killed our envoys serving abroad, which is really a great shame of modern civilization. Japanese soldiers are responsible for destroying international law and humanitarianism in the Chinese Philippines and other regions, and they have been successively punished or subjected to international trials. This kind of sanction should be a warning to those who disregard humanity and the law, and can slightly comfort the loyal souls of Consul General Yang and the martyrs.</p>
<h3>Todd Talks About Yellow River Repair and Defense, If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Can Implement a Ceasefire, The Dike Closing Work Can Be Completed Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Todd, Chief Engineer of the UNRRA Yellow River Water Conservancy Project Consultant, came to Shanghai from the Yellow River flooded area last week, waiting for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to implement a ceasefire agreement so as to complete the Yellow River dike restoration work.</p>

<p>Todd continued: If the ceasefire agreement can be implemented, there is a 90% chance that the Yellow River will not flood this year, and the flooded area can be restored to fertile farmland. The cost of repairing and defending the Yellow River is estimated to be US$15 million to US$18 million, most of which is supplied by UNRRA (including materials and equipment).</p>

The Far East Hotel at Jiushengkou in the North Bureau recently received a letter from the association, saying that the hotel was stealing water for profit. Zhou Sichun, the manager of the hotel, believed that it was inconsistent with the facts and appealed to the county council and revealed that Shi Youyi, the chairman of the Youth Association, had been a traitor during the occupation.</p>

<h3>Navigation Policy Conference Closes Today, Review Meeting Yesterday Morning, Proposal Review in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Navigation Policy Conference is scheduled to hold a general meeting on the morning of the 9th and a closing ceremony in the afternoon.

First, Yu Runsheng, the representative of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, reported on military transport. Then, Wang Zuozhou, the Chief of the Port Affairs Section of the Navigation Affairs Department, reported on the general situation of port affairs across the country and future plans for rectification, stating that my country's port management has always been good, and ports such as Lüda have not yet been recovered, and the ports of Yantai and Weihaiwei are still in the hands of the Communist Party. In order to remedy the development of port affairs in the Northeast, the government established a port affairs bureau in Huludao on July 1 so that goods from the Northeast can be exported. In addition, there are 35 seaports across the country, of which Qingdao, Keelung, Guangzhou Bay, Shanghai, Kaohsiung, and Huludao are larger, but the water depth is only within 30 feet, so few meet the new standards. After the report, representatives raised questions separately, especially on issues such as pilotage rights and joint pilotage management, asking the most questions. The review meeting was held in the afternoon and divided into four groups: the first group was navigation affairs, presided over by Wang Kuang, the second group was ships, presided over by Zeng Ziguang, the third group was maritime affairs, presided over by Huang Muzong.

<h3>Ministry of Interior Issues Directive to Provincial and Municipal Governments: Resolutely Practice Economy and Strictly Prohibit Unnecessary Socializing by Civil Servants</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 8th] The Ministry of Interior states that as the nation's reconstruction after the war is difficult, it is necessary to vigorously promote economy in order to shift the social atmosphere. The implementation rules for the promotion of the economy campaign have already been established. All civil servants should lead by example, take the lead in advocating and actively promoting it so that it can be effective. However, it is heard that some places still hold commemorative events for officials who have served for several years, or hold lavish banquets to welcome or send off officials upon their arrival or departure, or engage in extravagance for weddings, funerals, and other major events, and accept gifts. These behaviors waste financial resources and violate the principle of economy, and should be strictly prohibited in order to rectify the social atmosphere. The Ministry of Interior has already issued separate directives to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct their subordinates to comply. Furthermore, since the National Government promulgated the National General Mobilization Order, the Ministry of Interior has attached even greater importance to the practice of economy. It is reported that during inspection tours, personnel will conduct on-site inspections and guidance.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Eliminate Waste! Eradicate Corruption!</h3>
<p>We have already read the full text of the National General Mobilization Act passed by the State Council. We have also read President Chiang's July 7th broadcast address and Premier Chang's speech clarifying the meaning of general mobilization. Standing in the position of the press, especially as a member of the Shanghai media, we wish to sincerely express our views frankly, for the benefit of those in and out of government. We believe that the greatest enemies of general mobilization are waste and corruption!</p>
<p>First of all, we must recognize: why is it necessary to implement general mobilization almost two years after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan? It is simply because the Chinese Communist Party has rejected peace, resorted to arms and rebellion, destroyed construction, and ruined the nation's vitality, ruthlessly damaging and squandering the fruits of victory, which is infinitely regrettable! The government's repeated tolerance and compromise over the past two years has only fostered arrogance and insatiable greed among the Communists, leading to widespread warfare and devastation, almost surpassing that during the War of Resistance. Due to the lessons of the past two years, the government's policies, while well-intentioned, were misguided, ultimately delaying the nation's progress! Looking at the series of disasters in the Northeast and Northwest, we can vaguely foresee the eventual outcome. As Chinese people, how can we not cry out in grief!</p>
<p>The cruelty and belligerence of the Communists, and the true nature of democracy in the so-called "liberated areas," were fully described yesterday in an article entitled "Democracy and People's Organizations" by the Ta Kung Pao, which has always been lenient towards the Communists. As of today, we believe that regardless of party affiliation or lack thereof, anyone who advocates unconditional peace based on a concern for the nation will be able to discern who genuinely seeks peace and who uses peace as a pretense. Now that the National Government has realized that two years of appeasement have been futile, it has decided to mobilize the entire nation to overcome the current difficulties, quell the rebellion as soon as possible, and rebuild the foundation of the nation, in order to fulfill its responsibility to save the people in the war zone and rescue the dying national destiny. It can be seen that this general mobilization is truly a last resort.</p>
<p>President Chiang's statement, "To stand idly by today is to await death tomorrow," is absolutely true!</p>
<p>Now that we know that "general mobilization" is a last resort, and that "general mobilization" simply means that the government requires the people to stand firm in their positions, be serious, abide by the mobilization laws, and contribute their strength and resources, then these government demands on the people are also the obligations that the people owe to the nation. Only when the government calls upon the people's strength and the people respond to the government's demands can a strong and organic whole be formed, which can quell the rebellion and build the nation, thus achieving its goals. However, the current social extravagance and general public's wastefulness are deteriorating rapidly, which is shocking! The cost of one banquet can reach tens of millions [currency not specified] which is absurd! Ultimately, we see that defeated Japan is catching up day by day, while compatriots in various places are suffering from natural and man-made disasters. Can we still bear to play and waste, without any sense of alarm, and truly be like swallows under a collapsing curtain?</p>
<p>Secondly, we want to especially awaken the vigilance of government authorities at all levels! It goes without saying that the general public opposes communism, especially detesting the Communist bandits, but they may not fully trust the government's policies, which is most noteworthy. If the government does not receive the support and endorsement of the people, how can it truly achieve general mobilization? In the past, the government's documents were well-written, but the implementation was sloppy, and laws and regulations quickly became mere formalities. Ultimately, the problem lies in the lack of confidence, sense of responsibility, and willingness to work hard among those involved. The various corrupt phenomena of shirking responsibility, delaying, procrastination, and complacency have made people lose confidence. The cautious follow precedents and are inefficient, while the cunning take advantage of their positions for personal gain and engage in illegal practices, often treating it as commonplace. Thus, the original intention of the legislation, even if it was for the benefit of the people and the nation, has become a disaster for the nation and the people as a result of the execution of the law! This trend has historically waxed and waned with the rise and fall of the nation, and therefore there are particularly many bad examples during times of chaos. The government is currently drafting various laws and regulations to accompany the general mobilization plan, and it is essential to put oneself in others' shoes beforehand, weigh the importance, consult widely, and draft them properly, so that the laws themselves are absolutely sound and the executing agencies have no room for excuse in the future. Furthermore, the officials at all levels responsible for implementation must face reality, thoroughly recognize the importance of the mobilization laws to the survival of the nation, strictly rectify themselves, and make every effort to implement them, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the War of Resistance period, when general mobilization was largely nominal. What is most important is that those who fail to implement effectively must be punished, and those who take advantage of the mobilization laws to disturb the people and engage in corruption must be punished with the most severe penalties. It must be understood that the failure of the nation is due to corrupt officials, and without a clean government, nothing can be discussed. To govern a chaotic world, use severe punishments. The achievements of Zhuge Liang and Zhang Juzheng can be used as a guide for those in power today. We recall the so-called war profiteering, victory profiteering, takeover profiteering, and reconstruction profiteering of the past. Although people have talked about it a lot, how many have been punished severely? The thunder was loud, but the rain was light. Some offenders may even stick up their thumbs, boast and gloat, and retaliate against those who reported them. The result is not only that the government undermines its own credibility, but also implicitly encourages bad people to do evil. The more bad people rise in society, the more good people will decline, and those who are neither good nor bad will gradually flow into the ranks of the bad people. With the decline of morality and the pursuit of private interests, how can "general mobilization" be achieved? As the old saying goes, "If the law is not enforced, those above violate it." In the future, many laws and regulations will be promulgated to accompany general mobilization, and we specially emphasize that the government should first pay attention to the agencies and personnel implementing the laws, and ensure that they are just and impartial, without the slightest bit of laxity. Otherwise, the "bad eggs" will attract flies, and the result of taking advantage of the laws for personal gain will inevitably render the general mobilization, which is related to the fate of the nation and the lives of the people, a failure, and the suppression of the Communist bandits will not be able to end quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, the current situation in China is truly as Premier Chang said, "The people of the whole country must have a fundamental understanding that this is a struggle between the forces of construction and destruction in China." In addition to military suppression of the rebellion, there are also political and economic wars. But politics and economics are fundamentally inseparable. Good economic decisions must rely on a enlightened political environment and must be implemented by honest administrative officials in order to achieve the expected results. Because economic measures are related to money and wealth, it is easy to tempt the greed of corrupt officials. Therefore, in economic mobilization and economic warfare, the eradication of corruption should be the top priority!</p>
<h3>Beware of "Starvation Exports"!</h3>
<p>Japan's foreign trade can be opened from the middle of next month, and the Japanese are not only actively preparing for it, but have also recently shouted out a slogan of "starvation exports" in an attempt to return to Southeast Asia and seize the market. The ambition of the Japanese is obvious, which is not only enough to prove that our country's opposition to opening up Japan's foreign trade is justified, but can also be seen as a precursor to the fact that British and American commodities will encounter a strong enemy in the Southeast Asian market.</p>
<p>Japan's slogan of starvation seems easy to win the sympathy of various countries; however, the eyes of people in various countries are sharp, and the Japanese attempt to hide the truth from the world will eventually fail. If the people of Japan today are truly struggling on the starvation line, China has always been generous and kind, and will definitely not oppose opening up Japan's foreign trade and not allowing Japan to find a way out; however, what is the situation in Japan after the war, those in Japan can see very clearly. What is seen by everyone, we have seen many faithful reports from foreign reporters, not to mention; moreover, all measures related to the lives and order of the Japanese people must prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression!</p>
<p>In recent days, many news of provocation against China have been transmitted from Tokyo, forcing us to raise our vigilance. It is necessary to take precautions against minor issues and plan early. Because Australia is dissatisfied with the US's Japan policy, Foreign Minister Evatt has decided to go to Tokyo at the end of this month to personally discuss the Japanese peace treaty with MacArthur; no matter what, our country is a major country in the Far East, not only the country with the deepest interest in Japan, but also one of the factors determining the safety of the Far East; whether for the peace of the Far East or for its own safety, it should speak out at this time and clearly express its position!</p>

<h3>Serious Situation Brewing Between the Soviet Union and Western Countries: The Ideal of "One World" Difficult to Achieve; American Left-Wingers Deeply Confused by the Soviet Union's Actions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The split between the Soviet Union and Western countries over the Marshall Plan is expected to develop into an explosive situation within two weeks, a situation that has been brewing for many months in the major economic bodies of the United Nations. The summer meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council will open here on the 19th of this month, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe is currently meeting in Geneva, where conflicts may erupt at any time. In addition, there are several other major factors: (1) It is rumored that the Soviet Union may refuse to participate in the United Nations Far East Economic Commission meeting opening here on the 10th of this month. (2) The Soviet Union has refused to participate in the United Nations Small Business Conference opening in Paris on the 9th. (3) The Soviet Union is no longer attending the international trade conference currently being held in Geneva. (4) Yugoslavia has withdrawn from the International Labor Office today.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 7th] American diplomats predict that the United Nations General Assembly to be convened in the fall and the four-power foreign ministers' conference to be held thereafter may mark the beginning of a long-term breakdown in the post-war Allied relationship. They believe that it is unlikely that major countries will change their current policies, and the theory of "One World" can be said to be dead. Therefore, major countries should seek ways for "Two Worlds" to coexist during the autumn meeting, so as to reasonably guarantee peace. Diplomats are greatly alarmed by the imbalance of power and the increasingly fierce political and economic competition between the East and the West. In particular, the Soviet Union's rejection of the Marshall Plan seems to have made the breakdown of the four powers even more obvious. Therefore, many of them believe that if the illusion of "One World" can be abandoned, and the two forces can be divided, it may be easier to handle the world situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] Observers here believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate under the Marshall Plan, which has divided Europe into two halves, will make it extremely difficult for pro-Soviet elements in the United States to find an excuse for the Soviet Union's actions. In fact, the Soviet Union has made it clear that it does not want to build Europe on any foundation other than its own terms. This has put left-wingers and liberals in the United States in a dilemma. The left-wing newspaper "PM" in the United States can be taken as an example. The newspaper, which has always been pro-Soviet, pointed out in its editorial today that the Soviet Union's gambling move seemed reckless and irresponsible. This move seemed to be deliberate, in order to plunge the world into a chaotic state, so that communism could take advantage of the chaos. Regardless of its motives and results, the Soviet Union cannot escape its major responsibility for dividing Europe and fostering the danger of war. Whether the two worlds, namely the United States and the Soviet Union, can coexist depends on two prerequisites: (1) The United States should provide sufficient and unrestricted material assistance to many countries, and improve their living standards. Food, security, and jobs are the best weapons to resist communism and instability. (2) Assist the neutrality of Western Europe, making it strong enough to be a strong buffer zone. What we want to point out is that American left-wingers and liberals are quite in favor of the Marshall Plan, Wallace being one example. American left-wingers are divided into three factions, namely the right wing, the central faction, and the extreme left wing of the left wing. The reaction of these so-called liberals is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Attacks Britain and France at the United Nations European Economic Conference: Hopes Dim for Soviet Participation in European Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 7th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the Soviet representative fiercely attacked Britain and France, and the British and French representatives retorted, resulting in a fierce verbal battle. Soviet representative Zorin accused Britain and France of colluding to oppose the Soviet Union. He claimed that Britain and France had secretly prepared the Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference behind the Soviet Union's back. It is difficult to understand why British Foreign Secretary Bevin consulted with French Foreign Minister Bidault before the Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference was held. The Soviet Union objected to Britain and France's intention to establish an organization outside the United Nations framework, because this organization would infringe upon the sovereignty of small European countries. The Soviet Union will never agree to European countries falling under American economic control.</p>
<p>British representative and Minister of State McNeil stood up to refute the Soviet representative's accusations, saying: The Soviet representative's accusation that Britain secretly acted behind the Soviet Union's back has no factual basis. May I ask if Foreign Secretary Bevin needs to obtain the Soviet Union's permission before wanting to talk with foreign officials, such as French Foreign Minister Bidault and US Under Secretary of State Clayton? There is nothing "sinister" about the meeting between Foreign Secretary Bevin and Foreign Minister Bidault. The Soviet representative's empty speech wastes the time of the European Economic Commission. Like the Soviet representative, he also knows that the division of Europe is extremely dangerous, and Europe is not a chessboard for leisurely chess playing, but for countless hungry and suffering men and women. French representative and Minister of National Economy Philip then replied to the Soviet Union's accusations, saying: The Soviets always exaggerate everything, which is a dangerous habit. The Soviet representative implied that the Soviet government believes that Britain and France are colluding to oppose the Soviet Union. I must protest this argument. The Marshall Plan is a "new era in history," and I hope that all countries can assist in the reconstruction of Europe under free conditions. The European Economic Committee then adjourned the meeting and scheduled to reconvene at 11:00 am tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] Britain and France have not yet given up hope that the Soviet Union will participate in the European reconstruction conference, but given the Soviet representative Zorin's attack on Britain and the United States at today's meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva, this hope seems slim.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovak Delegation Leaves for Moscow</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 7th] The delegation led by Czechoslovak Prime Minister Gottwald will depart for Moscow tomorrow to hold talks with Soviet politicians to discuss the situation after the failure of the Paris Three-Power Economic Conference. Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk and Justice Minister Outlyna are also among the delegates. According to well-informed sources, this trip is also related to Czechoslovakia's acceptance of the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the Paris conference to discuss the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspapers and Radio Stations Criticize British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 7th] Soviet newspapers and radio stations today broadcast a TASS dispatch from London accusing British Foreign Secretary Bevin of following Washington's orders and attempting to use the Marshall Plan to divide Europe into two major camps. This action has been unconditionally supported by French Foreign Minister Bidault. The United States uses aid as bait to stimulate the obedience of certain British and French leaders. But on the whole, these people are not particularly welcome to the Paris conference and have already anticipated its failure. This is the most scathing attack on Bevin by the Soviet newspapers.</p>
<h3>Clayton Arrives in Paris</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 8th Broadcast: US Under Secretary of State Clayton flew to Paris from Geneva on Tuesday. It is expected that Clayton will stay in Paris for two or three days to hold talks with the highest French authorities, but will leave before the opening of the Marshall Plan conference on Saturday, regardless of the outcome of the gambling.</p>
<h3>United States and Turkey Sign Credit Loan Agreement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 7th] Turkish Foreign Minister Huca and the leader of the US delegation will sign a credit loan agreement of 100 million US dollars here tomorrow to strengthen the Turkish army and economy. However, the agreement will not be submitted to Congress for approval until the Turkish National Assembly convenes on August 25th.</p>
<h3>Twelve Countries Accept Invitations to Discuss the Marshall Plan for European Reconstruction; Attitudes of Eastern European Countries Are Quite Inconsistent</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 8th Broadcast: The Austrian cabinet has accepted the invitation to the Paris conference. The Swiss Federal Council has also formally accepted the invitation, but with certain conditions.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 8th] The countries that have accepted the invitation so far are Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia, and Iceland, totaling ten countries.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 8th Broadcast: Several countries within the Soviet sphere of influence have decided to participate in the Paris conference to discuss the Marshall Plan for European reconstruction. According to news from Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union is now very likely to reconsider participating. A Bulgarian spokesperson said that Bulgaria may participate. As for Yugoslavia, although it has been announced by Radio Moscow that it will not participate, it is reported that Tito is very interested in the Marshall Plan and may also participate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] Countries closely related to the Soviet Union are now divided on whether to participate in the Paris conference to discuss the Marshall Plan. It is reported that Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia plan not to participate in the meeting to be held in Paris this Saturday, while Czechoslovakia has decided to agree to participate.</p>
<p>According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow, Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia will not participate in the Paris conference. A dispatch from Bucharest stated that the government has decided not to join. Poland and Yugoslavia are happy to accept US loans, but would rather deal directly with the creditor and do not want anyone in between. Semi-official sources in Prague stated that the Czechoslovak government has decided to authorize its ambassador to France, Noske, to participate in the Paris conference.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 8th] The Finnish cabinet has voted four to two to refuse to participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The British newspapers expressed surprise and pleasure at Czechoslovakia's acceptance of the British and French invitation and its willingness to attend the Paris conference.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 7th] Budapest: A government spokesperson said that Hungary has scheduled a special cabinet meeting for the afternoon of the 7th to discuss whether or not Hungary will participate in the Paris conference. According to well-informed sources, the Hungarian Smallholders Party and the Social Democratic Party are putting pressure on the government to accept the invitation from Britain and France, but the Communists have expressed opposition.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] The Italian Communist Party is in favor of participating in the Paris conference, but has put forward many conditions, and it is expected that various countries within the Soviet sphere of influence will follow suit and imitate each other.</p>
<h3>Political Crisis Brewing in Turkey</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 8th] Responsible sources said today that a serious political struggle within Turkey may lead to Prime Minister Peker's early resignation. The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Okman hurriedly returned to the capital from Istanbul to discuss with President Inönü. It is reported that Peker is at odds with the President and Democratic Party leader Bayar. Bayar accused the current cabinet of being a terrorist cabinet with reactionary tendencies and unable to make Turkey democratic.</p>
<h3>British Government Announces Establishment of Economic Planning Board to Provide Advice on Resolving Current Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Minister of the Privy Council, Morrison, announced in the House of Commons today the organization and mission of the newly established British Economic Planning Board. The main task of the board is to provide the government with advice on using economic resources to resolve current difficulties and implement long-term plans. The chairman of the board is Sir Nuploden, who will also sometimes chair the tasks of the Economic Planning Board personally. The members will be selected from individuals with extensive experience in industry, labor, and management. The permanent secretary will be selected from the three government departments in charge of trade and industry. With the establishment of the Economic Planning Board, the government and industry can engage in closer cooperation and exchange of views.</p>
<h3>Truman Asks Congress to Pass Immigration Bill to Receive Refugees as a Responsibility of the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] President Truman today sent a message to Congress, urging it to take prompt action to pass legislation allowing a significant number of European refugees to enter the United States. The President did not mention any specific number, nor did he mention any of the immigration bills previously submitted to Congress that have seen little progress. However, he emphasized that it is unimaginable to leave these refugees indefinitely in refugee camps. The President strongly stated that these refugees should not be forced to enter Germany to live with the people who had massacred them. Furthermore, Germany's economy has been devastated by the war, and with the influx of Germans from neighboring countries, the population is overcrowded and on the verge of economic suffocation. The United States government firmly opposes forcing refugees to return to their original countries. The world is now watching whether the United States can fulfill its promise to allow refugees to come to America. It is the responsibility of the United States to assist these unfortunate people together with other countries. President Truman also pointed out that the existing immigration quotas are inappropriate, and special legislation must be passed to allow a large influx of European refugees.</p>
<h3>Bevin Plans to Attend Paris Conference Opening Ceremony in Person, Countries Seem Eager to Avoid Political Involvement as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] It was announced today that Foreign Secretary Bevin plans to go to Paris and at least attend the opening ceremony of the Paris Conference. This news has increased interest in the Paris Conference from all sides. So far, it is still unknown whether the Paris talks will be diplomatic or technical. Will participating countries send foreign ministers or economic experts to attend? Although Bevin is going to Paris, it is still expected that the conference will be kept as apolitical as possible and remain strictly economic. If countries such as Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark decide to participate, they will obviously be willing to avoid political involvement as much as possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the development of the conference affairs, if the Cooperation Committee—the Comprehensive Committee—is established on May 15th, it is expected that the four subcommittees can immediately begin collecting information so that the Cooperation Committee can prepare the final report based on this information. It is reported that reports on major issues will be sent to Paris from the beginning of the conference, indicating that Britain and France do not want to waste a moment to start working. For the organization of the Cooperation Committee, Britain and France advocate that it be composed of representatives from Britain and France, one representative from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, one representative from the Scandinavian countries, one representative from Eastern Europe, and possibly one representative from Italy. The number of members of the subcommittee will be approximately the same as this, but in any case, it will not exceed ten people. The first task after the opening of the Paris Conference will of course be to elect members. As for whether the Paris Conference can remain strictly economic without political involvement, it will depend on the following two questions: (1) Whether Eastern European countries other than Czechoslovakia will be invited to attend in Paris; (2) Whether Mr. Molotov will make political demands before agreeing to participate in the work of the various committees.</p>
<h3>Bevin Elaborates on European Cooperation</h3>

It was said that regardless of the outcome of the vote, it cannot prove the support or opposition of the Spanish people, nor can it be regarded as Franco having the right to speak on behalf of the Spanish people.

<h3>UN Security Council Discusses Balkan Issue, United Nations Faces Crisis, Monitoring Greek Northern Border Case Will Cause Fierce Debate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The Soviet Union is ready to issue an important statement today, responding to the requests of the United States and Britain that the United Nations take action on the urgent situation in the Balkans to restore order. Representatives of the Security Council countries are prepared to discuss this matter and other issues all day, believing that the most critical moment in the history of the United Nations is approaching.</p>
<p>The big question today is whether Soviet representative Gromyko will use the veto power to obstruct the United Nations monitoring of the Greek northern border proposed by the United States. British representative Cadogan has declared that if the Security Council cannot resolve the Balkan issue, then the United Nations mechanism is better off dissolving. U.S. representative Austin also insisted that the Security Council must take some action and use force when necessary. Given the positions of the British and American representatives, if the Soviet Union uses the veto power, it will inevitably cause an unprecedentedly major crisis in the United Nations structure. The nature of Gromyko's statement is kept secret, but according to colleagues, Gromyko will speak in Russian. In recent months, Gromyko has used Russian for important statements. It is expected that Gromyko will defend Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, denying that the turmoil in the Balkans is mostly the responsibility of the three affiliated countries, which is undoubtedly, and will make a strong attack on Greece. There are two other issues on today's agenda: one is to vote on the disarmament implementation plan proposed by the United Nations Committee, and the other is to discuss the application for membership by Albania, Outer Mongolia, Portugal, Ireland, and Transjordan.</p>
<p>Security Council Passes U.S. Disarmament Plan</p>

<h3>Jewish Government in Exile Reportedly Established</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Florence, 8th] This agency has learned from well-informed sources close to the Jewish resistance movement in Italy that the work of organizing a provisional Jewish government in exile is almost complete.

The provisional government will actively establish agreements with democratic countries and do its best to solve the outstanding issues. The Irgun has 110,000 people and is currently fighting the British and will remain secret for the time being.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Agrees to Discuss Original Country's Energy Quota System, Insists Atomic Weapons Should Be Destroyed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] Regarding the "quota system" for world atomic energy to determine each country's atomic energy production, equipment, and atomic fuel, Soviet representative Gromyko expressed his willingness to participate at today's meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission, and said that the Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to establish a system before atomic energy can be effectively controlled. According to this quota proposal, which was proposed by France on June 19, the World Atomic Control Organization should be responsible for allocating each country's atomic energy materials according to the special provisions of the World Atomic Control Treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] At today's meeting of the drafting subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, Syrian representative Cole proposed that the Security Council should keep atomic bombs in custody for future use by international peacekeeping forces. Soviet representative Gromyko took the lead in opposing, saying that unless atomic bombs are immediately destroyed, any proposal violates the previous resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and is difficult to accept. The UN General Assembly resolution stipulates that the prohibition of atomic weapons is unconditional, and it is too late now. We cannot violate this resolution. Representatives from China, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Brazil generally agreed with Gromyko, advocating that all atomic weapons should be prohibited domestically or internationally. Representatives from France and the United States believed that this issue should continue to be discussed. This proposal has now appointed a four-country subcommittee to be responsible for drafting the Soviet proposal. In addition, the meeting also passed a resolution advocating that the international army to be organized should maintain world peace and should not be equipped with atomic energy weapons.</p>

<h3>U.S. Economic Mission to Japan, Rumors of Further Reduction in Reparations, Japanese Financial Circles Express Optimism</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] The U.S. Schyler Economic Mission will visit Japan for the second time. U.S. and Japanese observers believe this will further reduce Japan's reparations. However, Allied headquarters said that some reparations will not be delayed due to the arrival of the mission. It is worth noting that each investigation of Japanese industry has resulted in benefits for Japan. This investigation may indicate that the State Department intends to strengthen Japanese industry more than MacArthur's concern. Japanese financial circles are very optimistic about this, and the reparations delegations of various countries stationed in Japan are even more concerned, believing that the best result will also delay 30% of the temporary reparations. One foreign reparations observer said: "This is like having two strikes before we even start working." (Note: The English "strike" is homophonous with Schyler.)</p>
<h3>Flying Saucers in Space, Australia Also Appears</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th (Broadcast): It is said that "flying saucers" are still flying in the American sky. According to the Air Force ground forces, they are conducting preliminary investigations and have discovered that "flying saucers" are not a secret bacterial weapon. Two university students said they saw the object as oval, emitting reed light, watching it move in the sky, and disappearing after about three minutes.</p>
<p>[France News Agency, Sydney, Australia, 8th] The "Solar Evening News" reported today that the American moving "flying saucer" in the sky was also seen by six people here yesterday. On the other hand, Sydney University physics professor Dr. Kohden proved the unreliability of the "flying saucer" theory with vision today. Corden ordered all students to stare intently at the horizon. Twenty-two students claimed to have seen "flying saucers." Koh explained that this is an optical illusion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bozeman, Montana, 7th] Baird, a pilot from the Fanhe Chute Geographic Photography Company here, collided with a "flying saucer" while flying a "P-88" aircraft over the Smoke Leaf Root Mountains in western Montana on the 6th. He said: "The flying saucer" looked like a pearl-gray clam-shaped aircraft with a mesh dome on its head, about 15 feet in diameter and about four feet thick. When the monster flew past his aircraft, he had avoided it, but the flying saucer was defeated by the wind power of his aircraft, and it split into two pieces like a clam, and then entered the Madison Mountains. After the flying saucer fell, he saw several "flying saucers" circling around. Pelter did not say that he was busy flying the plane to pay attention to whether there was anyone in the flying saucer, and forgot to take pictures of it with the camera, and it was too late to think about it later.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] General Arnold, the wartime commander of the U.S. Air Force, speculated that the origin of the "flying saucer" has three possibilities: (1) It was invented by foreign scientists and its actions cannot be controlled; (2) It was invented by American scientists and has not yet been perfected; (3) Or it is just a kind of jet fighter. The U.S. Army and Navy authorities are extremely impatient about this matter and are conducting a thorough investigation, but they have not yet made it clear.</p>
<p>[United Press, Stockholm, Sweden, 7th] According to a reporter from the Gothenburg Liberal Party Evening News stationed in Copenhagen on the 7th: flying saucers were also discovered in Copenhagen on the evening of the 6th, the same as those that appeared in the United States. However, Copenhagen newspapers have not yet had news of the appearance of "flying saucers."</p>
<p>[France News Agency, New York, 7th] According to Mr. Barlow, a famous inventor from Stanford, Connecticut, this "flying saucer" was manufactured by the Martin Aircraft Factory under the Ministry of the Navy. It weighs one ton, is controlled by radio, is jet-propelled, and has a speed of 1,500 miles per hour. The pilot speaks with certainty, the professor dismisses it as nonsense</p>

<h3>Urging Factories to Form Cooperatives, Aiming to Reduce the Cost of Living, Will Use Cooperative Prices to Compile Index Standards, Wu Kaixian Said It is Beneficial to Both Labor and Management</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that he is promoting a new system to urge factories in the city to establish consumer cooperatives. In the future, the distribution of daily necessities will be handled by the cooperatives. Each factory must also supply a portion of its products to the cooperatives of other factories. For example, a match factory that distributes rice at a fair price must supply fair-priced matches to the cooperatives of each factory, and so on, helping each other, similar to the ancient barter method. This will enable workers to obtain all the daily necessities they need at fair prices from the cooperatives, without having to seek them at high prices in the market. When the authorities compile the cost of living index, they can also use the prices of fair-priced items from the cooperatives as the standard, so that the worker's cost of living index can obtain a reasonable result and will not rise excessively. This is not only to seek welfare for workers, but also the factory benefits a lot. However, because this matter requires upfront money, it must be handled by the factory. It is hoped that each factory can understand and work together to promote and achieve its realization. Then, the cost of living index for workers in the city may be lower than in other places.</p>
<h3>Planning Recovery: Labor Hospital - Clearing Hospital Assets, Repaying Private Investment</h3>

After the hospital is recovered, it will be renamed a labor hospital. The necessary funds will be raised through donations from factories and workers. In the future, the hospital will serve workers under the supervision of the Trade Union Federation.

<h3>Jiancheng Flour Mill Dismisses Workers: Demanding Reinstatement, Gathering Crowds and Using Violence, 31 People Sent to the District Procuratorate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the Jiancheng Flour Company's First Factory was taken over in November last year, there were 131 original workers. The factory felt that there were too many workers, so they used a lottery method to decide who to keep.

The discussion on how to argue reasonably to salvage the unfair allocation of seats for legislators from the industry and commerce sectors and the standards for the distribution of National Assembly representatives was the most heated, lasting for an hour and a half. Regarding the 330th meeting of the Fourth Legislative Yuan, which passed a resolution that occupational groups should have one seat in the National Assembly, with industrial and commercial groups accounting for 7% of the total, of which 13 seats were allocated to commercial representatives, accounting for only 3% of the total number of representatives from occupational groups, it was considered a stubborn and unreasonable prejudice against occupational groups.

<h3>World YWCA General Secretary Speaks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The World YWCA Joint Conference is scheduled to be held at the Xiling Hotel in Hangzhou from October 15 to 27 this year. Participants include representatives from China, Canada, the United States, India, Burma, Ceylon, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines, Japan, Australia, and countries in South America and Southern Europe, totaling nearly 100 people. Ms. He Huande, the General Secretary of the Association, a descendant of Gu Yanwu, arrived here from Geneva, Switzerland on the 3rd of this month. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, she met with reporters at the YMCA on Yuanmingyuan Road and said: The World YWCA Conference was originally scheduled to be held every four years. Due to the impact of World War II, it has not been held for nine years. Moreover, this year's conference site is located in the East, which is a historical first, so its significance is very profound, and its mission is even more important than in the past. In addition to deciding on the direction of the World YWCA's work in the future, the conference will also discuss women's living issues and the responsibilities of Christian women. The number of representatives from each country participating in the conference has been decided to be no more than 12 and no less than 2, which is proportionally allocated based on the number of members in each country. China will have 5 representatives and 15 observers.</p>
<h3>Citizens Report Black Market Trading of Gold Certificates: Rewards Given According to the Informant Reward Method</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Economic Supervision Council has decided to reward citizens who report the buying and selling of gold certificates, and the method of issuing bonuses will be expedited. All will be handled in accordance with the "Informant Reward Method for Buying and Selling Gold Certificates" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance.

The remaining 50% to be used for rewards should be allocated as follows: 50% to the arresting agency, 20% to the assisting agency, and 30% to the sponsoring agency. In the future, the issuance of bonuses for reporting the buying and selling of gold certificates will be handled in accordance with these regulations.</p>
<h3>Warehouse Industry Expresses Opinions on Restricting Warehouse Receipt Trading: Stipulating a Deadline for Delivery Will Affect Business - Social Affairs Bureau Will Solicit Opinions from Cotton Yarn, Sugar, and Other Industries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In accordance with the decision of the First Economic Conference to restrict warehouse receipt trading, the Director of the Economic Administration Department, Mr. Gu, and the Section Chief of the Price Management Section, Mr. Shao, of the Social Affairs Bureau convened the persons in charge of warehouses throughout the city at 10:00 am yesterday to listen to their opinions. According to the warehouse industry: (1) In the past, the warehouse could extend the delivery date after it expired, so there was no rigid restriction. (2) Off-site warehouse receipt trading has nothing to do with the warehouse and cannot be restricted by the warehouse. The warehouse allows delivery based on the seal and the warehouse receipt, regardless of the buying, selling, and transfer of the warehouse receipt. (3) The goods stored in the warehouse are not necessarily for hoarding and speculation, so they believe that if warehouse receipt trading is restricted and delivery is limited to a certain period, customers will inevitably be unwilling to store goods to avoid trouble, and the business of warehouses will be affected. Director Gu stated that the warehouse receipt period will be determined in accordance with the actual commercial situation, taking into account both the merchants' turnover period and the government's intention to prevent malpractices, so as to make warehouse receipt trading more standardized. The Social Affairs Bureau now intends to order each warehouse to report the main daily necessities stored. Director Wu said that if the goods are not delivered after the deadline, the name of the owner will be investigated for verification.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau is also scheduled to continue convening the persons in charge of major daily necessities such as cotton yarn and food within the week to listen to their opinions on restricting warehouse receipt trading. Then the Social Affairs Bureau and relevant agencies will formulate implementation measures and submit them to the Economic Conference for decision.</p>
<h3>Five Directors and Supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce Discuss Business and People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce come from all over the country. Due to time constraints, the reporter was unable to visit them all. He only spoke with Ji Dianchuan and others from five places: Tianjin, Hubei, Guangdong, and Ningxia. He inquired about the recent business conditions and the people's suffering in various places. The main points are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Severe Food Shortage in Tianjin</p>
<p>Ji Dianchuan, Chairman of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce: There is a shortage of food in the north. Rice in Hebei is sold for 6,000 yuan per jin. Now the food from the northeast can no longer be supplied, and the Grain Department's control over maritime food transportation is too strict, which discourages merchants. Therefore, only free transportation can suppress the price of food in North China. The Communist area is tightly sealed off, and the price of food is lower than that in the free area. The food transported to the north in the future will not flow into the Communist area. The market in Tianjin is depressed, mainly due to the obstruction of the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways. The price of daily necessities is lower than that in Shanghai, and the purchasing power of the citizens is very weak. The citizens hope that the amount of relief materials transported to the north by the Executive Yuan can be increased. The revitalization of the economy in North China is not a simple issue, but relies on the development of the military and political situation. Due to the Communist Party's conscription, the phenomenon of abandoned farming is serious. Due to the early drought, there is no hope for the autumn harvest. If the government cannot provide planned relief, there will be a serious food shortage between August and September.</p>
<p>Abundant Cotton Harvest in Hubei</p>
<p>Li Jianting, Chairman of the Hubei Chamber of Commerce: Wuhan suffered greatly from the enemy's devastation during the war. In the two years since the victory, due to the overall situation, industry and commerce have not only failed to recover the losses of the war, but are also in a precarious state. The biggest difficulty in the industrial sector is that prices are rising too fast, making it difficult to reproduce. In terms of prices, it is about half of Shanghai's. White rice is currently sold for 230,000 yuan per dan. This year's cotton harvest in Hubei is better than ***, and the best quality is Baba Cotton, which can spin 20-count yarn. In addition to self-sufficiency, Hubei cotton can supply other provinces, and waterway transportation is also very convenient. In addition to attending the Chamber of Commerce meeting, I also plan to contact the discount and lending committee. In the past, the mortgage was limited to raw materials, and machinery and real estate could not be mortgaged, which is unreasonable. I have met with President Zhang to discuss this matter, but there is no concrete decision yet.</p>
<p>Rising Silk Prices in Zhejiang</p>
<p>Chen Qinshi, Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce: The spring and summer silkworms in western Zhejiang are both good this year, so the farmers' lives are still good. The National Bank's loans this year are very sufficient. For example, each silk weaving machine can be loaned 3 million yuan, and loans of more than 1 billion can be obtained by mortgaging silk. Silk prices have risen in the past month, so farmers have benefited greatly. The local order is very good, but the folk customs need to be improved. In terms of transportation, the government is hoped to loan more than 1 billion to accelerate the completion of the highway from Nanxun to Huzhou. This line, combined with the Sujia Highway, connects the transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which is of great significance to the prosperity of the economic relations between the two provinces. The mulberry trees in western Zhejiang were greatly damaged during the war, and the number of existing mulberry trees is quite limited. It is estimated that it will take three years to recover.</p>
<p>Rampant Smuggling in Guangdong</p>
<p>He Yage, Guangdong Chamber of Commerce: The economic situation in Guangdong is relatively stable. Prices are about 30% lower than those in Nanjing and Shanghai. Industry and commerce do not feel the lack of raw materials and are relatively prosperous. However, the current flood is a major blow to the economy of South China. The sugar mills and weaving industries in Guangdong are developed, and the sales reach Southeast Asia. However, due to the large difference between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate, imports and exports are difficult. The Guangdong coast is more than a thousand miles long, and smuggling is rampant. The fundamental solution is for the government to establish an agreement with the Hong Kong government to effectively crack down on it. The inflow of overseas remittances into Hong Kong and Shanghai is an even greater loss. It is estimated that the total amount of overseas remittances from the Americas is more than 200 million US dollars per year, and overseas remittances from Southeast Asia have not yet been calculated.</p>
<p>Mexico Treats Overseas Chinese Harshly</p>
<p>Deng Chuanshan, Mexican Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce: There are about 10,000 overseas Chinese in Mexico, all of whom are engaged in grocery stores, restaurants, department stores, and so on. In the past, the *government unilaterally stipulated: New overseas Chinese customers were not allowed to enter the country, and old customers were allowed to return to the country for a period of two years, and were not allowed to enter the country after the deadline. In terms of the commercial sector of overseas Chinese, they are treated equally with Mexicans in law, but they are arbitrarily fined under the pretext of "unsanitary" everywhere, oppressing overseas Chinese. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Mexican people's respect for China increased. At the same time, the Chinese government is also negotiating with the Mexican government to sign a commercial treaty, and it is expected that the situation will be improved in the future.</p>
<p>Ningxia Awaits Development</p>
<p>Qiao Senrong, Director of the Ningxia Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce: Ningxia is the gateway to the northwest national defense of our country. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese army never reached the territory of Ningxia Province. Only the provincial capital was bombed twice. The Communist bandits only invaded two-thirds of Yanchi County, which was recovered by the National Army this spring. Therefore, Ningxia suffered very little loss during the war. Governor Ma Hongkui is diligent and loves the people, and is deeply supported by the people. The highway transportation in the province is smooth, and goods flow smoothly. Helan Mountain is rich in minerals, but it lacks funds and technical personnel. The great treasure has not been developed. "The Yellow River has a hundred harms, but it only enriches one sleeve," and the Hetao area is in Ningxia. There are tens of thousands of miles of fertile land on both sides of the Yellow River, but the population is scarce, and the land cannot be used to its full potential. It is hoped that industrialists and businessmen with long-term vision will invest in the northwest. Ningxia is rich in medicinal materials, wool, and leather, all of which are good export products for exchanging foreign exchange. If scientific processing is added, the economic future of Ningxia can be expected, and it is located in the border area, so its importance in national defense economy cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, Xu Letian, Tried - Summons All Witnesses - Interrogation of the Suspension of Distribution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Shanghai District, was tried by Prosecutor He Huimin in the District Procuratorate yesterday morning on charges of corruption and embezzlement.

The interrogation lasted from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, and they were released on bail separately. The investigation yesterday was based on the accusation of the Coal Industry Association that, between December last year and March this year, the Committee stopped the distribution to coal merchants without an order from the Ministry, causing more than 1,100 coal merchants to be in a state of stagnation. The market price of coal per ton rose rapidly from more than 100,000 yuan to more than 1 million yuan. The court inquired in detail about the above-mentioned facts.</p>

<h3>The Zhijiang Steamer Tragedy; Suspected of Intending to Conceal Evidence of Crimes; Manager of the Tongji Company Indicted</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Li Qianyu, the manager of Tongji Steamer Company, was indicted by the District Procuratorate for suspicion of intentionally concealing evidence of crimes. On January 17, year 36, the Zhijiang steamer of Tongji Steamer Company collided with the Huatong steamer at the Wusongkou, resulting in its sinking. After consultation by the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Tongji Steamer Company was responsible for salvaging the corpses and the Zhijiang steamer. Unexpectedly, Li attempted to conceal evidence of other people's crimes by not salvaging the corpses and allowing fish and insects to erode them. Subsequently, the water police team salvaged the corpse of Zhou Bangzhen, a passenger who died in the disaster, and notified his elder brother, Zhou Haigen, to claim it and file a complaint with the District Procuratorate. After investigation by Prosecutor Liang Gengshun, the core of his actions constituted the crimes under Article 165 and Article 247, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and therefore he was indicted.</p>
<h3>The Journey of a Handgun: Many People Implicated</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In June of last year, Tang Di, the special service company commander of the Youth Army's 208th Division, gave an Italian-made "Beretta" brand automatic pistol, serial number 65254, to his friend Wang Deyu, a security team member of the Songshan District Office, when he was transferred to the Northeast. On June 2nd of this year, Wang lent it to Fu Zhongren, who was studying at Guanghua University. Fu then told him that it was inconvenient to carry the gun to school, so he deposited it at the home of his friend Feng Xianzhao. At that time, a United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) staff member, Wang Kebin, was being threatened by hooligans, so he borrowed the gun from Feng through his friend Lin Genkang for self-defense. On the sixth of last month, Wang accidentally fired the gun while playing with it, injuring his left knee. He admitted himself to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. After investigation by the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct, he was found to be using an unlicensed handgun, which endangered public safety. The unlicensed handgun was given to Shan Wali and sent to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhu Zonghai summoned Wang Kebin and all the above-mentioned related persons for questioning and ordered them to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Harassing Female Patrons Sparks Dispute; Changping Grand Theater Suffers</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Changping Grand Theater of the Jiang-Huai Opera Company, located at No. 344, Guihua Road, West Shanghai, was staging a performance the other night when several policemen from a certain brigade attempted to harass a female patron, leading to a dispute with the theater staff. They then left in anger. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 PM last night, thirty or forty strong men wearing white shirts and yellow shorts went to the theater again to stir up trouble, forcing the theater to hand over the female patron. When they failed, they vented their anger on the theater, wantonly destroying it. Tables, chairs, teacups, and tea stands were flying everywhere, and the audience fled in panic, causing great chaos. The theater urgently reported to the Jiangning Precinct, which dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene. However, the perpetrators had already dispersed. The theater suffered losses of approximately 1,450,000 yuan. The police are investigating the marks of the perpetrators to identify them for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Divorcee Remarries; Ex-Husband Gathers Gang to Extort</h3>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>(1) Encroachment on Ancestral Property</p>
<p>Pan Binyong asks: A certain family has inherited several houses, which they have occupied for a century. In the years 22 and 23 of the Republic (1933 and 1934), A reported the land registration in his own name and held a map and property certificate as proof. Recently, due to the Land Bureau re-registering, it announced that old maps and certificates are not valid and must be re-registered and issued. Unexpectedly, a certain B from the same clan intended to encroach on the property. While A was away, B privately reported the registration without authorization. When A found out, he argued with B, who claimed that it was public property and had an old division agreement as proof. Both sides were unable to reach an agreement. I would like to ask: (1) Does A have absolute ownership of the house that has been occupied for a century? (2) Can the map and certificate of the first registration reported by A in the years 22 and 23 of the Republic be submitted as proof? (3) When A reported the registration initially, B did not raise any objections. Now B has privately registered without authorization, using the old division agreement as an excuse. Is there any suspicion of encroachment?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] If B claims that the houses are jointly owned and A has paid taxes for the entire century of occupation, then A can sue the court to confirm his ownership of the houses and request the local government to change the registration. The map previously obtained by A can be used as evidence in the lawsuit. B's private registration to attempt illegal acts constitutes the crime of illegal occupation of real estate under the Criminal Law (Article 320, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law).</p>
<p>(2) Unreasonable Rent Increase</p>
<p>Yu Xiaoru asks: A rented a room in the city from B at the end of last year through an intermediary, stating that the term would be six years. B is a widow, so the house ticket was issued in the name of her son (B was still a minor at the time). Now B has gone elsewhere and her uncle, C, is in charge of the house. Because C disagrees with A, he is using excuses to force A to move out, otherwise he must increase the rent. A is unable to pay any more rent and is extremely anxious. There are several questions now. I would be grateful if your lawyer could answer them: (1) Is the lease contract signed between the widow B and A still valid after being transferred to C for management? (2) Can A refuse to pay if C increases the rent unreasonably?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) An existing lease relationship does not lose its validity due to changes in the owner or manager. (2) The Civil Code does not allow for the rent of a fixed-term lease to be increased or decreased at any time. Even if the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery allow for a possible increase in payments, but an increase was made not long ago, and now there is another increase. Circumstances have changed, and there is no such speed. A can state the reasons and urge him to reflect. If it is unavoidable, he can sue the court for a determination.</p>

<h3>Many Visitors to Fuxing Park Lament; Red Dancer Bitterly Ill Takes Her Own Life; Sends Suicide Note, Calmly Takes Poison; Foresaw Burial Plot Before Death; Epitaph Inscribed with Small Bird; Unbearable Sadness of Life Story</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Lin Daiyu-like dancer, Fang Zhen (pictured), 25 years old, from Guangdong, has a graceful figure and a beautiful appearance. Three years ago, she used the alias Shi Qimin to dance at the Metropolitan Dance Hall. She was quite knowledgeable and spoke eloquently, so her reputation soared and she was very popular for a time. Later, due to suffering from lung disease and pleurisy, she stopped dancing to recuperate. As her illness worsened, she dressed up and committed suicide by taking poison in Fuxing Park at 4:00 PM on the 6th. After the Lujiawan Police Station discovered it, she was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but died on the morning of the 7th. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Cao of the District Procuratorate went to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to examine the body. Her uncle, Zhu Chunshi, her cousin, Zhu Fangju, and her former patron, Zeng Yongxiang, claimed the body for burial. Fang lost her parents early and was lonely and helpless, living with her uncle's family. Living under someone else's roof made her depressed and unhappy. The root of her troubles had already been planted in her childhood. She suffered from lung disease five years ago. Since she became a dancer, her business was quite good, but Fang's weak body felt increasingly overwhelmed. Before long, she stopped dancing. At that time, for the sake of her health and happiness, she spent her earnings on hiring famous doctors to treat her, which cost a lot, but her condition did not improve. She then followed the doctor's advice and</p>
<p>Moved to Another Place for Treatment</p>
<p>In the autumn of that year, she went to the Taihu Lakeside Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Wuxi for treatment. On the 22nd of last month, she was forced to return to Shanghai due to lack of funds, temporarily residing in room 426 of the Xiang Sheng Hotel on Shaanxi South Road, and went to Dr. Qi Yun's clinic at No. 120, Nanjing Road for examination. The X-ray results showed that her left lung had rotted and that eight rib bones had been infiltrated, and there was no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Fang thought her future was bleak, and the thought of suicide arose spontaneously. At this time, there was still a sad piece of music. A dance patron, Zeng Yongxiang, whom she had not seen for several years, suddenly met her at Dr. Xu's clinic. Zeng was from Guangdong, and due to their shared hometown relationship, they were very close. Later, Zeng went to another port to do business. Fang also stopped dancing to recuperate, and they had not seen each other for several years.</p>
<p>Sudden Reunion</p>
<p>They were overwhelmed with emotion. Zeng escorted Fang to the Xiang Sheng Hotel (this room was opened by Hongye on his behalf). Zeng saw that the room was small and opened a larger room, No. 432, for her to live in. Although Zeng tried to comfort her in every possible way, Fang's determination to die was firm. Knowing that lung disease was contagious, she did not want to harm anyone, so she sold all her meager jewelry and belongings, obtaining more than ten million yuan. Before committing suicide, she made various meticulous arrangements. First, she went to the China Coffin Company at No. 835, Xin Zha Road, and ordered a coffin, paying 5,550,000 yuan, and paid 1,500,000 yuan for shrouds and quicklime. Then she went to the Hongqiao Public Cemetery and ordered a burial plot, and ordered a</p>
<p>Stone Tablet</p>
<p>From the Jianhua Marble Company nearby and designed it herself. A small bird was carved on the top of the tablet, with flowers inlaid on both sides. A "ten" character was carved under the bird, and the words "Fang Zhen" were carved below. She paid 4,000,000 yuan. When everything was ready, she wrote a letter in pen on July 5 to the Lujiawan Police Station, sent from the "12" post office, stating: "To the honorable officers, I know that suicide is a criminal act, but I have no parents and am lonely and helpless. I now suffer from lung disease. Dr. Xu Qiyun has diagnosed me as being terminally ill and there is nothing to keep me in this world. I have no choice but to commit suicide. Fang Zhen." She put a fingerprint at the end of the letter. After the letter was sent, she went to Fuxing Park calmly at 4:00 PM the next day, quietly entered the deep forest, and took a large number of sleeping pills to commit suicide. White leather shoes and a white leather bag were placed on the sidewalk outside the deep forest, so she was discovered. She had a "Fang Zhen's Confession" hidden in her arms, the gist of which was the same as the letter to the police station, but it included the address of her cousin, Zhu Fangju, at No. 17, Lane 303 (Shunqing Lane), Qipu Road, asking her to come and collect the body. After the police station investigated at that address, there was still a box left</p>
<p>Expensive Perfume</p>
<p>In the box, there was a bottle of expensive perfume, with a note saying that there was a bottle of expensive perfume in the box, please sprinkle it all over the body during the burial. Her cousin, Zhu Fangju, had already followed the will. Also, before committing suicide, Fang burned all her previous photos, so there was no portrait of her in front of her spirit. The photo published in this newspaper was found after much searching and is the only one that remains.</p>

<p>The Meaning of Basic Education</p>
<p>Basic Education (Fundamental Education) is a relatively new term. The individuals who coined this term chose it because they wanted to encompass both children's education and adult education, indicating that this education not only teaches people to read, write, and calculate but also imparts certain fundamental skills, enabling them to make a living, improve their economic situation, express their thoughts artistically and cultivatedly, improve their healthy living environment, and participate in domestic and international political activities, thereby guiding them towards a more fulfilling and complete life. Currently, there is no other term that adequately encompasses these goals, hence the adoption of the term "Basic Education."</p>
<p>The Main Objectives of the Conference</p>
<p>The main objectives of this Basic Education conference are: (1) To gather data on basic education in various countries in the East and South Pacific from various experts. This type of data should be of considerable value to other countries and UNESCO.

(3) To report to the conference participants on the status of basic education work in other countries around the world. (4) To familiarize participating experts with UNESCO's situation, particularly UNESCO's intentions and plans for basic education. (5) To further review the experimental work that should be carried out in the Chinese basic education demonstration design, to determine norms for use as reference for other countries. (6) To explain the importance of greater efforts in basic education work around the world and to encourage them. (7) To further develop the technology of regional meetings for future application in other regions of the world. (8) To demonstrate UNESCO's deep interest in the East and South Pacific region.</p>
<p>Scheduled Agenda</p>
<p>The conference schedule has been arranged as follows: September 1st, the opening ceremony will be held, with welcoming remarks by members of the Chinese government, a response from UNESCO's chief representative, the reading of a message from the Director-General of UNESCO, and responses from expert representatives; in the afternoon of the 1st, experts from various regions will present reports on basic education.

<h3>Fourth People's Education Promotion Zone Held Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>

Over a hundred ward chiefs and school principals attended. Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Department, Director Gu of the Education Bureau, Deputy Director Li, and others attended and provided guidance. After Director Xu Zexiang reported on the preparations, the chief officials spoke successively. Director Gu believed that promoting popular education was a "conscientious work of building bridges and repairing roads" and should be pursued with enthusiasm. Director Zhang emphasized that local self-government personnel should closely connect with education workers to eradicate illiteracy and complete the foundation for civil governance. Deputy Director Li advocated that literacy education should employ flexible methods and planned to use films to assist in teaching. Subsequently, Section Chief Sun of the Social Education Department explained the working steps: (1) Surveying the illiterate population (to be completed by the end of August); (2) The existing people's schools and national education classes in each school should enroll the full number of students as much as possible to reduce the financial burden; (3) Mobilizing intellectuals, university and middle school students, and enthusiastic individuals in the entire district to assist in teaching, with textbooks provided by the Education Bureau, and rewards given to those with excellent performance.

<h3>Dean of Xiamen University's College of Liberal Arts Urgently Advocates Promoting Romanized Pinyin; Considers Chinese Characters as Our Nation's Ancient, Worthless Broom; Unable to Quickly Eliminate Widespread Illiteracy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhou Bianming, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at National Xiamen University, flew from Xiamen to Shanghai at the invitation of the Ministry of Education and went to Beijing last night to participate in the preparatory meeting for the Far East Regional Conference on Basic Education. Zhou studied linguistics in Europe and America in his early years for over twenty years and is a renowned linguist in our country. In recent years, he invented Mandarin Romanization (Pinyin) to replace the currently used Chinese characters, marking a major revolution in the history of language. This trip aims to propose a concrete plan for language reform at the preparatory meeting for the Basic Education Conference. In an interview with reporters yesterday, he stated: Basic education should first pay attention to the issue of tools, which can be studied from both international and domestic perspectives. From an international perspective, we believe that the tool of education should not be an artificial language created out of thin air but should utilize a universally used international language such as English. From a domestic perspective, the fact that the ancient, worthless broom "Chinese characters" cannot quickly eliminate widespread illiteracy is a fact known to the world. Why then should we not abandon the old and seek the new? Therefore, our country today should, like Turkey and Japan, resolve to resolutely adopt Romanized Pinyin, which is easy to teach, learn, read, and write, and caters to the trend of "one script for the world." We should suggest to UNESCO: (1) Urgently convene with our government to quickly pass a unified system that can be internationally recognized so that linguists can concentrate on the research of its various sub-topics, avoiding wasting energy on trivial and meaningless debates. (2) Establish research institutions affiliated with suitable universities in our country to cultivate talents as much as possible so that the new system can be quickly promoted from top to bottom. (3) Donate the latest modern printing equipment to our research institutions to quickly publish reading materials for widespread promotion. We should also suggest to our government: (1) It is hoped that the government can issue a clear decree to actively promote this plan. (2) A clear decree should be issued immediately stipulating that all telecommunications must use Romanized Pinyin. (3) Special funds should be raised to cover the expenses of various institutions expanding this business.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Charity Tennis Tournament; Clash of North-South Heroes; Ye Guanxiong Suffers from Fever; Performance Not Ideal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hong Kong Airmail] The charity tennis event for disaster relief, postponed due to rain, staged a prelude on July 3rd. Originally a singles competition, it was changed to a doubles exhibition match due to Guanxiong's fever and Wang Wenzheng's illness, featuring Lai Guanxiong and Xu Weipei against Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng.</p>
<p>First Day of Competition</p>
<p>Changed to North-South Singles Exhibition</p>
<p>The four North-South heroes competed, but both sides had ill players, resulting in a less than stellar performance. Xu Weipei's performance was the best. Ye Guanxiong, despite his illness, only showed his skill in the fourth set, with several well-placed shots near the sidelines.</p>
<p>Tao Guanqiu also performed well, his serve was powerful, and his short strokes and quick attacks were agile with good angles. Unfortunately, Wang Wenzheng was not at his best, frequently hitting "dead balls" and squandering several high-pressure opportunities to win, failing to block effectively at the net, rendering him less effective than the lively and powerful Ye-Xu duo. Tao-Wang lost due to a slight difference in skill.</p>
<p>The match adopted a best-of-five-sets format. Xu served first. In the first set, Wang and Tao took two games first, but were forced to 3-2 by Ye and Xu, with Wang and Tao falling behind. Ye and Xu then won the first set 6-4. The second set was the most contested, with both sides tied at 4-4 and 5-5. Ye and Xu then won two more games, overwhelming Wang and Tao 7-5, creating a 2-0 lead.</p>
<p>By the third set, the atmosphere was more relaxed. Tao and Wang fought back hard, winning a set 6-4, making it 2-1. In the fourth set, Wang Wenzheng's fatigue was evident, unable to withstand the fierce attacks of Ye and Xu, losing another set 2-6, ending the match 3-1, with Ye and Xu winning. Finally, Jiang Daozhang, a veteran of the Davis Cup, played a singles exhibition match against Tao Guanqiu. Despite enduring four sets of intense battle, Tao remained unstoppable, defeating "Old Jiang" 6-2.</p>
<p>Second Day of Competition</p>
<p>Davis Cup Veterans Suffer Dual Defeats</p>
<p>The weather on the 4th was excellent. Singles exhibitions continued at the Chinese Recreation Club. Unexpectedly, Ye Guanxiong was unable to participate due to a fever. The order was temporarily changed, with Tao Guanqiu facing Xu Weipei and Wang Wenzheng facing Jiang Daozhang. This change completely altered the situation. The two Shanghai players overwhelmed the Hong Kong players, both winning two consecutive sets.</p>
<p>The match between Guanqiu and Weipei was particularly exciting. Guanqiu excelled in momentum, frequently using powerful baseline strokes to suppress Weipei. Although Weipei occasionally blocked at the net, he lacked the strength, so Guanqiu was ultimately able to win two consecutive sets with scores of 6-2 and 6-3.</p>
<p>In the final match, Daozhang faced Wang Wenzheng. "Old Jiang" still had some fight at the beginning, but later his fatigue became evident. Wenzheng won easily, also winning two consecutive sets with the same score of 6-3, 6-3. The pair of old Davis Cup players suffered dual defeats, giving a sense of heroes in their twilight years.</p>
<p>Another Charity Match to Be Held</p>
<p>Ye and Tao to Battle for Supremacy</p>
<p>As a result, it remains undecided who is the tennis king. According to Tao and Wang, their delay in returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong is both for the charity event and to compete with Hong Kong's new champion, Ye Guanxiong, hoping to face "Little Ye."</p>
<p>The charity event organizers feel the same way. To increase charitable donations, they plan to hold another charity match next Tuesday (the 8th), following the original order, with Ye Guanxiong facing Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng facing Xu Weipei. If this can be arranged, the performance of these two ideal pairings will surely satisfy fans.</p>

<h3>Ninth Act of Ping Pong Finals; Post Office Team Comes from Behind; Hualian Hua Wins First, Loses Later</h3>
<p>The ninth act of the eight-team finals of the Second Ping Pong League was held at the Central Auditorium last night at 8:00 PM, with over 300 spectators. Shen Baihong and Wang Yishan served as referees. After the initial contact, Liu Zaoshi of Post Office A used his skills to easily defeat Qin Yuheng in straight sets. In the second group, Jiang Chunshan, a veteran of Post Office A, launched fierce attacks, but Gu Jinxiang of Hualian Hua remained composed, countering with long shots and remaining remarkably steady, ultimately defeating Jiang. In the third group, Xu Zhifu of Hualian Hua demonstrated both intelligence and courage, delivering an excellent performance, winning 3-1 against Zhou Xintang. In the fourth group, the main battle was between Li Feixiang, captain of Hualian Hua, and Li Guangyao, a major player of Post Office A. The two Lis engaged in a fierce battle. Feixiang had lost to Guangyao in the sectional finals of the previous tournament. Meeting again, he dared not be careless, taking the lead all the way. Guangyao was unable to counterattack, losing 3-1, and Feixiang avenged his previous defeat, creating an absolute advantage of 3-1 for Hualian Hua. The players of Post Office A lost color, as Zhang Qihong in the fifth group did not seem to be a match for Zhou Weixin of Hualian Hua. Unexpectedly, Qihong remained exceptionally calm and cautious, while Zhou lost his composure due to nervousness, frequently committing errors. Zhang Qihong defeated Zhou Weixin in straight sets, and his contribution to turning the tide for Post Office A was immeasurable. In the subsequent two groups, Post Office A took advantage of the opportunity, and Post Office A defeated Hualian by a score of 4-3, which can be considered fortunate. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(Post Office A) (Hualian Hua) (Score)</p>
<p>Liu Zaoshi Qin Yuheng 3-0</p>
<p>Mei Chunshan Gu Jinxiang 0-3</p>
<p>Zhou Xintang Xu Zhifu 1-3</p>
<p>Li Guangyao Li Feixiang 1-3</p>
<p>Zhang Qihong Zhou Weixin 3-0</p>
<p>Zhuang Kunrong Liu Baotai 3-1</p>
<p>Wang Huijun Lu Yunzhang 3-0</p>
<p>Tonight at 8:00 PM, the tenth act of the finals will continue at the original location, with First Division Champion Star Team facing the Fourth Division Runner-up Green Team. Dai Yongquan and Shen Baihong will be the referees, and Hu Shansheng will be the recorder. The lineup of the Shanghai Star Team is strong and can be considered top-notch, but when they played the second time, both generals Lu Hanjun and Li Zongpei were absent, and the performance was not outstanding. The Green Team recently defeated the strong Hualian, showing their prowess. They face a formidable enemy again tonight, so let's see who wins.</p>
<p>(Shanghai Star) Xue Xuchu (Captain), Fu Qifang, Wang Changhou, Yu Cheng, Cheng Aixin, Huang Gaoyuan, Huang Zhijun, Huang Zisong, Li Zongpei.</p>

<h3>Five Measures Decided by the Cotton Cloth Industry to Assist the Authorities in Suppressing Old Cloth Prices, While Negotiating with the Textile and Construction Bureau to Improve Distribution Methods</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Due to the soaring prices of cotton yarn and cloth, the authorities have sternly discussed the matter with industry leaders, urging them to quickly find ways to suppress prices. More than a dozen cotton cloth businesses have been inspected one after another. As a result, there have been no large transactions in the cotton cloth market in recent days. Some large firms have even taken the opportunity to close for the summer to avoid disputes. However, yesterday's market prices remained stable with a firm undertone. Since the textile and construction bureau's opening, the small quotas and high prices have ultimately driven up market prices. The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Business Association on Shanxi Road, recognizing the necessity of complying with government orders and lacking confidence in suppressing prices, convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at 3 PM yesterday. They unanimously agreed that times are difficult, and cotton yarn and cloth are under close scrutiny from all sides. They resolved to cooperate in stabilizing prices, and the resolutions included: (1) Since the Longtou cloth textile and construction bureau has not opened for a long time, the market will temporarily suspend trading. Operations will resume when the supply normalizes, to avoid stimulation. (2) Strict control of the market will be enforced, and non-association members will be prevented from entering the market. (3) Members of the brokerage association handling transactions in the market should rectify themselves and report the parties they dealt with to the association. The association will investigate whether their transactions are legitimate. (4) Black market transactions outside the market are absolutely prohibited. (5) The market will be open from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM, with the afternoon closed. The above items will be announced jointly by the association and the brokerage association. A persuasion team will be organized by the directors and supervisors to take turns persuading against black market activities outside the association. On the other hand, the association's leaders will negotiate with the Textile and Construction Corporation on improved distribution methods to reassure the public. According to a certain authority in the industry, May and June of the lunar calendar are typically slow months. However, after the textile management committee was shut down, the textile regulation committee has yet to establish a regular method for supplying cotton yarn, resulting in a significant reduction in textile mill production. Furthermore, new cotton yarn prices have just been negotiated, and there are rumors of further negotiations. Hearing this, merchants inevitably start purchasing and transporting goods again. This is the reason why the market has inevitably risen recently. In fact, the extent of the increase is limited. Taking the most closely watched Longtou fine cloth as an example, compared to ten days ago, it has risen from 420,000 to 460,000, an increase of about 10%. If there is a solution for the yarn market, it will not be difficult to suppress the price increase of cloth. It is also said that the price of dyes has recently increased again. The main reason for the increase in colored cloth does not seem to be the raw cloth but the dyeing and processing costs. Taking Indanthrene Blue as an example, the dyeing cost is greater than that of the raw cloth.</p>
<p>Mostly Closing Transactions; Small Rebound Seen in Chinese Stocks Yesterday</p>
<p>Chinese stocks saw more closing transactions yesterday due to a gloomy atmosphere in the industry and unfavorable conditions, leading to oversupply. Extensive help for storage also appeared on the market, while new buying power was limited, ultimately curbing buying sentiment. Major players in the industry gradually became shaken, with initial upward momentum dissipating before closing. Tight credit conditions further contributed to the decline, except for Wuhe and Yonggong.</p>
<p>The morning opened with lower prices. Di Yong Yarn opened with a nominally rising but actually falling trend. After the opening, No. 133, No. 69, and No. 65 were sold at 10,800 yuan, while No. 89, No. 76, No. 163, and No. 117 advanced to 11,000 yuan.

No. 235, No. 197, No. 85, No. 97, No. 61, No. 232, No. 89, No. 157, and No. 75 still showed strong buying interest, with Tongyi taking the lead in raising prices to the limit.</p>
<p>Yonggong, through No. 223, and Di Yonggong, through No. 105 and No. 226, and Wuhe, through No. 222, also reached their limit. Di Yong Yarn rose to 11,180 yuan. No. 235, No. 224, No. 94, No. 223, No. 197, No. 22, No. 102, No. 24, No. 4, and No. 23 sold off. Although No. 8 of Yizhong and No. 56 of Zhongnan bought in, prices still dropped to 10,700 yuan. By 10:30 AM, No. 82, No. 54, No. 89, No. 104, No. 160, No. 183, and No. 102 recovered to 11,000 yuan, but prices then fell back to 10,750 yuan. No. 224 and No. 202 briefly advanced to 10,900 yuan. No. 235, No. 142, No. 153, and No. 152 constantly supplied and sold. No. 223 and No. 224, after buying in, suddenly sold, and No. 85, No. 212, and No. 14 also sold, falling to 10,450 yuan by 11:45 AM.</p>
<p>No. 218, No. 85, and No. 104 took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, rebounding to 10,600 yuan. No. 102, No. 218, No. 117, No. 231, No. 199, and No. 154 closed out their positions, with retail investors selling off. Before the midday close, prices retreated to a low of 10,230 yuan. No. 231, No. 76, and No. 223 bought in to cover, and the noon close rose to 10,450 yuan. After the close, the asking price rose to over 10,500 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn was flat, Yonggong rose by 10%, Xinnuo fell by a weak 0.5%, Xinguang fell by a strong 0.5%, Meiya, Huafeng, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by 10%, Xinhua fell by a weak 15%, Zhongfang was flat, Tongyi rose by 0.5%, and Wuhe rose to the limit.

<h3>Public Bonds and Foreign Stocks Both Decline</h3>
<p>Public bonds saw renewed weakness yesterday. Tong Bing opened at 7,600 yuan, with a high of 7,700 yuan, but gradually fell to a low of 7,100 yuan at the close. Industry insiders from Room 503 and Room 551 were net buyers, while Room 360 and Room 230 were net sellers. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds each fell by 300 yuan, Tong Bing fell by 500 yuan, and Class D and E bonds each fell by 200 yuan, with about 1 million in transactions.</p>
<p>Except for British-American Tobacco, foreign stocks generally declined yesterday. Securities firms, banks, and Hong Kong firms were net buyers, while insurers sold off more. Ewo Yarns opened at 84,500 yuan and gradually fell to a low of 81,000 yuan at the close, while British-American Tobacco remained stable due to absorption by Li'an Yanghang and others. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Hong Kong Shipping, Land Investment, and Development declined. Ewo Yarns, Paper, Brewery, Steel, and Telephone each fell by about 0.5%, while British-American Tobacco rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market saw cotton yarn decline slightly, but customers still raised prices, and sentiment remained firm. Credit conditions in the industry remained loose, so buying sentiment was strong. Yarn factories still had large appetites, and floating sellers in the market offered goods, with scattered buyers making up for it, resulting in a balanced supply and demand situation and stable prices. According to various firms, prices for delivery to the factory were: Lingbao 2.05 million, Laohekou 2.05 million, Shashi 1.96 million. Prices for delivery to the warehouse were: Lingbao (special grade) 2.20 million, also 2.00 million, 1.98 million, American Midling 2.05 million, Shashi 1.895 million, 1.86 million, Chongsha 1.96 million, Sanyuzhen 1.74 million, Tongzhou 1.75 million, Laohekou 1.895 million, Taicang 1.59 million, Huoji 1.60 million, Zhoupu seed cotton (genuine) 320,000 per unit.</p>

<h3>Abundant Rice Arrivals, Market Conditions Continue Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 7,100 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Rice from Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Anhui arrived, and rice from Hunan also arrived in Shanghai. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has reopened, and Xian rice from Wenzhou and Taizhou has also arrived in Shanghai. Only a small amount of Taiwan rice has arrived. Market conditions continue to be downward, with supply exceeding demand, making optimism difficult. The earliest 60 Zi new Xian rice will soon be replaced by new crops. Sales in the market remain sluggish. Both Japonica rice and Xian rice fell by 10,000 yuan, and medium- and low-grade rice fell by another 13,000-14,000 yuan, with few buyers.

Mung beans from South China are being carefully picked at high prices, continuing to be raised repeatedly, while medium- and low-grade beans have fallen by 3,000-5,000 yuan.

Broad beans are flat and weak, red sorghum is depressed, corn has fallen by 2,000-3,000 yuan, sesame arrivals and stocks are both low, foreign firms are searching for supplies, making it a rare commodity, and prices are rising gradually, soaring by 10,000-20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shelled peanuts are selling briskly, with Southeast Asia buying heavily, rising steadily, breaking through the 500,000 mark, rising by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Wheat transactions are only sporadic, showing a weary and weak trend, falling by 3,000-5,000 yuan.

<h3>Continuing the Previous Day's Rising Momentum, Minor Fluctuations in Rayon, Factory-Spun Prices Firm, Silk Goods Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market saw an uneven trend in the morning. No. 120 Gaoshan Youguang opened at 30.66 million yuan, even reaching a high of 1.5 million yuan, but due to the excessively high price, few people inquired, and it fell slightly. The noon close was 1 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to rumors that a large amount of rayon would arrive in port, silk factory firms were mostly watching, sentiment softened slightly, and prices retreated again. The lowest bid was 30.2 million yuan, and the final bid was 30.5 million yuan, ending flat with the previous day's price. Other brands of goods all rose and fell accordingly, with no changes compared to the previous day's prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the factory-spun market was firm. High uniformity ABC grade prices were slightly higher than the previous day due to the scarcity of goods, with no transactions. D and E grade transaction prices were similar to the previous day. Medium grades saw slightly larger bids, ranging from 31.5 million yuan to 2 million yuan, with more than ten loads traded yesterday. High-grade separate load D-grade goods still traded at the original price from the previous day, and dry-spun separate loads also saw no changes in price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk goods rose again due to cost factors, especially quilt covers. Meiya quilt cover warehouse receipts were very scarce in the market, with no transactions yesterday, and the asking price was 4 million yuan. Dacheng quilt covers opened at a maximum of 3.35 million yuan, then bid at 300,000 yuan. Huaqiang quilt covers saw a maximum transaction of 250,000 yuan, then traded at 200,000 yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Dacheng checkered Bizon, after multiple boosts at the opening, was bid at 43,000 yuan, but due to more sellers than buyers, it ultimately collapsed, falling steadily. The final spot price was 1,800 yuan, and the next-day price was 2,100 yuan, a large increase of 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Hua Jin crepe prices were still bid at 28,000 yuan, but there was a lack of supply. Other goods were all slightly firmer.</p>

Also, there were 1,300 tons of medical equipment, ironware, and sundries, which were also goods from UNRRA.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was initially firm, with 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn once reaching 30.2 million yuan. However, as credit tightened, and with long telegrams from Hong Kong, yarn factories sold off, and bulls closed out their positions at high prices, causing prices to fall. The final price was 19.8 million yuan, a decrease of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 22 Special Shuangma also fell by 600,000 yuan to 11.8 million yuan, while Shuangma yarn fell by 200,000 yuan to 10.7 million yuan.

<h3>Bituminous Coal Sales Gradually Increase</h3>
<p>The coal market sees a dull trend for coal briquettes due to the impact of coking coal dumping, and prices continue to hover. Bituminous coal sales, however, are gradually becoming active, and market prices are also firm. Especially bituminous coal briquettes, the market is seeing a shortage of supply, and market sentiment is the strongest. Due to transportation costs, the Shanghai delivery price of Yuanhua coal dross is rumored to be adjusted, so there are not many supplies recently, and market sentiment is quite good. Coal briquette factories are also following closely. Fortunately, retail sales in coal shops are not smooth, making it difficult to see immediate gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Sentiment, Cigarettes Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was soaring, due to the impending adjustment of cigarette tax rates. Yongtaihe's delay in distributing goods to other regions further contributed to the rise. Zhonghua cigarettes finally continued to rise by 240,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Old knives also rose to 7.15 million yuan, Wuhua rose by 330,000 yuan to 6.28 million yuan. Hademen was 5.75 million yuan.

<h3>Export Green Tea Robust</h3>
<p>Export green teas such as Zhengzhen Zhenmei have been sluggish for a long time due to the lack of buyers from Zhangzhou. Recently, as some exporters are resuming quality checks, sentiment has been repeatedly firming, and sellers are showing intentions of selling at higher prices. As a result, although there were no actual transactions in the market yesterday, the process was tighter than the previous day. As for domestic tea, Tuoping is still not stagnant, and prices continue to show a good trend. Other Hong Kong firms are eager to purchase Shanghai White Chrysanthemum, but as the sellers are hesitant, there are no transactions. However, the situation is like adding wings to a tiger, becoming even better, and the future is promising.</p>

<h3>A Loyal Soul Demands Justice from the Traitorous Devil; Violent Rain Mingles with Filth</h3>
<p>— Nanjing, 5th Dispatch by Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua of This Newspaper – Ding's Recantation of Fu Mocun's Punishment</p>
<p>The murderous demon king, Ding Mocun, was too ferocious, too cruel. His sins were countless, his evil deeds numerous. Today, he was executed before a million citizens of the capital. Although everyone applauded, we feel that his dog's life should not have been prolonged until today. The authorities' delayed review inevitably caused disappointment. Look! How many compatriots were watching, how many compatriots were crying, and how many more were seeking retribution for blood debts, time after time, resistance after resistance. They were waiting anxiously. Now, in the afterlife, the loyal souls, perhaps, are settling accounts with Ding Xiancun. Zheng Pingru, whom he first violated and then murdered, is naturally his most formidable adversary.</p>
<p>"Number One" in the Heavens; Old Debts Settled</p>
<p>The name of Ding Mocun inevitably brings to mind the beginning and end of Ding's betrayal and harm to the people, as well as his stubbornness during the public trial. His treacherous face made it clear at a glance that he was a "murderous demon king"! Before the War of Resistance and until his betrayal, he held important responsibilities within the central government. Before the division of "Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (CC Bureau)" and "Military Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (Military Bureau)," he was the Director of the Third Division of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. He was fully aware of the country's secrets, military deployments, and our intelligence organizations. The central government at that time placed great importance on him. As late as the thirtieth year of the Republic, he was still a Major General Senior Advisor to the Military Affairs Commission. Unexpectedly, he transformed himself and followed Wang Jingwei in betraying the party and the country. Wang Jingwei used his past working relationships to re-employ him and entrust him with the important task of "puppet secret agent." Using a "key figure" who understood the country's internal affairs and knew the deployment of the intelligence organization to carry out work against the country and the government was naturally particularly convenient. In the thirty-second year, our central government's intelligence organizations in enemy-occupied territories were repeatedly uncovered by the enemy and puppets, and many of our underground comrades in the occupied areas were tortured by "He's special agents." These were all the monstrous crimes of Ding Mocun in harming the country and the people. Ding Mocun was indeed the "Number One" wanted criminal, far exceeding the bookish chief traitors Chen Gongbo, Si Ping, and Lin Baisheng by ten thousand times. He should be dismembered into a thousand pieces to appease the hearts of our people!</p>
<p>Horrifyingly Absurd "Bold Statements" in Prison</p>
<p>During several trials, he consistently quibbled, either claiming to be under the surveillance of the enemy puppets or shifting the responsibility onto Li Shiqun, whitewashing the sins of the "76th Headquarters" den of devils. These were just the typical arguments of a traitor. The most detestable thing was the absurd argument he made in the second trial, saying: "Please look at northern Jiangsu! Such a chaotic situation is a thousand times worse than Zhejiang. Zhejiang was able to lay the foundation for peace and security under my control. Why has northern Jiangsu become irreparable today? The reason is that it lacked a Ding Mocun." Reading the above absurd statement, one can see how arrogant and invincible he was in those days. I remember that in early February, when I braved the snow to visit Ding Mocun in the Tiger Bridge Prison, it was one of the most profound impressions I had. I asked him if he had any thoughts or reflections in prison. He said: "Ren Yuandao, Zhang Lanfeng... were all under my command in the past. They are opportunists with military power, so they are still officials now. I am now a character who has lost his gambling capital, so what else is there to say?" Thinking about it, if Ding Mocun had not surrendered, he would have inevitably fallen into the embrace of the Communist Party and harmed the country and the people again, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>The Capital High Court sentenced him to death on February 8, which was perfectly justified and not at all unjust. What face did he have to appeal? On May 1, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence, but Ding still refused to accept it. On May 14 and May 27, he applied for a retrial twice more. The Supreme Court rejected the last two appeals on May 23 and June 11, and rejected them again on June 24 and July 4. His fate was sealed from then on. Like a thunderclap, Execution Order No. 2039 of the Judicial Administration Department was finally delivered to the High Court by the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court at 11:00 AM on the 5th. The High Prosecutor's Office immediately dispatched Prosecutor Chen Shengzu as the supervising officer to carry out the execution.</p>
<p>Both Divine and Human Wrath: "Nothing to Say"</p>
<p>At 12:00 PM, this reporter was the first to receive the news and drove to the Tiger Bridge Capital Prison in 25 minutes. At that time, no one in the prison knew about it yet, so I sat and waited in the reception room to the right of the prison gate. Afterwards, reporters from various newspapers rushed to the scene, numbering more than 40 people. At 1:20 PM, the sky changed, dark clouds gathered, and the weather turned from hot to cool. At 1:40 PM, Prosecutor Chen Shengzu, accompanied by the court clerk and bailiffs, arrived in a small jeep and drove into the courtyard, then closed the gate and imposed strict security. After Prosecutor Chen arrived, Warden Kong accompanied him to inspect the execution ground. At that time, the sky became even darker, and thunder rumbled incessantly outside the window. Both divine and human wrath were aroused; everyone watched closely the end of this great traitor.</p>
<p>When the prosecutor announced the execution order, Ding trembled. "Do you have a will?" the prosecutor asked him. "It's too late to write a will, but I don't know if any of my family members have come?" As he spoke, he still looked around with his lifeless eyes, and when he found no family members, he continued, "I have nothing to say about my family, but if my family has financial difficulties in the future, I can only let them go..."</p>
<p>Then the judge told him that the law had a reasonable solution for the family and would reserve a reasonable living allowance. Then he said, "Do you have anything else to say?" "I won't talk about my personal affairs, but I don't know if the country can be more lenient towards a group of traitor cases. I hope to give them a chance to be lenient." His voice trembled a little. After he finished speaking, he smiled sinisterly. Prosecutor Chen immediately rebuked him, saying: "The area of France is not as large as one province of Sichuan in our country, and it has handled as many as 80,000 cases of traitors, of which 7,000 were sentenced to death. Our country has only executed a few major traitors so far, which cannot be praised as being lenient." Then he asked again if there were any last words. Ding thought for a moment and replied, "Nothing to say."</p>
<p>The prosecutor asked him three times, and he had nothing to say. In fact, from his pale face and hurried breathing, it could be seen that he had thousands of words to say, but his panicked expression prevented him from saying a word. He could only force a bitter smile and勉强 said, "Nothing to say."</p>
<p>To the "Underworld"; The Great Traitor's Career Concludes</p>
<p>At this point, Prosecutor Chen signed the execution order and ordered the bailiffs to escort Ding out. Ding was already panicked in the midst of the bailiffs' shouts, but he still pretended to be a "hero" and walked to the execution ground on his own. After about ten steps, he was stopped three times by Chief Executioner Zhu Kunfeng before he stopped. Just as Ding was about to look back, Chief Zhu aimed a Browning pistol at the back of his head and fired a shot. Ding immediately fell to the ground, his body lying on its right side, curled up into a bow shape, his hands crossed in front of his chest. The bullet passed through his forehead and right eyebrow, and his face and pants were stained with blood. A minute later, his limbs twitched incessantly, just like the scene when chickens and ducks are slaughtered. At that time, the executioner wanted to fire another shot, but the supervising officer persuaded him to stop. Then the bailiffs straightened his two legs and laid the body face up, and he finally died at 2:19 PM. Ding used to boast in court that he was an "underground worker." At this point, the career of the great traitor ended in the "underworld," which can be said to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, and everyone applauded!</p>
<h3>The Movement and Stillness of Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Qingdao Air Dispatch, 2nd. Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Hui Cheng</p>
<p>Every year in July and August, Qingdao experiences fog, which enters the land from the sea for forty or fifty miles. The wind cannot disperse it, and the stronger the wind, the denser the fog, which is very unusual. This is because in July and August, a warm current comes from the Southeast Sea, which meets the cold current coming from the Korean Strait in this area, thus forming fog. This is a special situation. According to the Meteorological Observatory's prediction: there will be three weeks in early July with visibility between fifty and two hundred meters. Today, the Meteorological Observatory issued a signal stating that at 2:00 AM this morning, a cyclone was stagnant or slowly moving at 40 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees east longitude. This location should be near Beiping. Here, a force 4 wind is blowing, the sky is cloudy, and there is fog. Therefore, it is feared that the weather will not clear up in the near future.</p>
<p>Opening of the Seaside Bathing Beach</p>
<p>The seaside bathing beach was opened on the 1st. Due to repairs, the opening date was postponed from the middle of last month to early July. This is an annual event. This summer is late, and the hottest days have reached about 80 degrees, but today it is only 68 degrees. Therefore, although the bathing beach is open, there are very few swimmers. It is expected that the bathing beach will be lively at the end of July and throughout August. In the past, every summer, people from afar often chose to spend the summer here because of the seaside bathing beach, abandoning Mogan Mountain, Gulangyu, or Beidaihe and taking Qingdao instead. The facilities of Qingdao's seaside bathing beach are so good that, considering only the coastlines of North China, it can be said to be second to none.</p>
<p>The First Seaside Bathing Beach, namely Huiquan Bathing Beach, is located in Huiquan Bay in the eastern part of the city. There are no hidden reefs, no whirlpools, and no raging waves. The area is wide and the sand is flat, and the waves gently roll onto the sand, making it an ideal place for sea bathing and swimming. The facilities are also the best among all bathing beaches. Whoever praises Qingdao's seaside bathing beach should take this as a representative. The facilities include yachts, diving platforms, floating platforms, docks, surfboards, life rings, and tap water showers. The gaps in the fences are filled with flowers and trees, as well as children's playgrounds. Dressing rooms and bathhouses are lined up, and their architecture is extremely competitive and colorful, adding to the charm. The Second Seaside Bathing Beach is located on Shanhai Pass Road, on the north bank of Taiping Bay in the southeast of the city. The area is connected to Taiping Bay Park on the shore and can accommodate 180 bathrooms, making it a scenic spot for sea bathing. The Third Bathing Beach is in Taipingjiao, which is smaller in scale and has some floral facilities. The Fourth Bathing Beach is located in the southern part of the city, in the east, south of Zhanshan Village. The area is also inhabited by summer vacationers, so a bathing beach was specially built. The Fifth Bathing Beach is located on Xinjiang Road, which is isolated in the northwest of the city, near the harbor and north of Xiaogang. The Sixth Bathing Beach is located south of Taiping Road, west of Zhanqiao Pier. There used to be bathhouses there, but they have been destroyed. There are hidden reefs at both ends of the bathing beach. The Seventh Bathing Beach is on Yanerdao Island. The place is not an isolated island in the water, but a protruding area. The Youth Association's youth camp building and the police station's pigeon mail are located there. In summer, it is a bathing beach, and in autumn, it is a great place to watch the tides.</p>
<p>The ones that have just been opened are the First, Second, and Sixth places. The Third, Fourth, and Sixth are exclusively used by the US military and managed by the US side. This annual event, even in these days of war and chaos, the seaside scenery should still be as good as in the past.</p>
<p>Strange Tale of Yellow Explosives</p>
<p>A few months ago, the security authorities here arrested a merchant and intercepted the goods he was transporting. The boxes were printed with the words "Cao Da." When the powder was tested, it could aid combustion, and when thrown into water, it produced bubbles. When tested with an extinguished match, it could be re-ignited, and it was slightly explosive. Therefore, it was considered to be explosives, and the merchant was detained and suffered hardship. The merchant was transporting goods to Weixian County, so he was not without suspicion. Although he claimed that it was an industrial raw material, there was nothing he could do. Later, the chemicals were handed over to professors at Shandong University for testing, and it was found to be sodium peroxide (Na2O2).</p>
<p>Recently, there has been news that yellow explosives will destroy Qingdao. The rumors spread, and those who spoke did not verify, and those who listened did not investigate, thus becoming a strange tale. First of all, a month ago, the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal auctioned off a batch of materials, which were yellow fragments, as dyes. This was determined by the customs and the China Textile Company. Subsequently, dye merchants Wang Xinpu, Hao Zan, and others jointly purchased them, totaling 2,900 catties, worth 6.38 million yuan. The merchants believed that it was indirect dye naphthol, but they did not know whether it was α or β naphthol. However, it was indeed effective for dyeing yellow khaki. This substance can burn, because most dyes can burn, and it can also explode. This was discovered by the detective team, who brought Wang Xinpu and others to the team for questioning before learning the whole story. According to the team, it was proven by the Luo's Chemical Testing Institute that this substance was indeed TNT. Therefore, 2,900 catties of drugs were extracted and temporarily managed by the police station. However, the customs inspection of the dye raised the question of what its basis was. Moreover, several chemical technicians were quite surprised. At this point, the news that yellow explosives were about to destroy Qingdao had spread. Even if we retreat ten thousand steps, if this were pure yellow explosives, its weight would be less than one and a half tons, which could only blow up a few houses, and it would be impossible to destroy Qingdao. The authorities are paying close attention to this kind of sensational rumor.</p>
<p>In fact, chemical experts here are paying close attention. According to a professor at Shandong University, with the equipment currently known in Qingdao, it is difficult to be sure about the chemical testing of such organic matter, unless it is handed over to the Central Research Institute, whose equipment should be able to determine what it is. As for observing its color, it does not seem like the so-called naphthol, because naphthol is white. If it is said to be TNT, it does not seem like it either. Chemical testing is currently being attempted.</p>
<p>Although the matter is a strange tale, it involves many aspects, and the enlightenment and lessons it gives us are profound.</p>
<p>Serious Refugee Problem</p>
<p>Qingdao is like an isolated island, with no land transportation to the outside world except by sea. Recently, the China National Aviation Corporation stated that since the Jiaoji Railway was cut off last time, more than 3,000 merchants from Jinan were stranded here, and more than 500 people went to register for a flight. This time, a plane was specially allocated to transport them. After the transportation is completed, the plane will leave Qingdao. Therefore, it is impossible for outsiders to fly to Jinan in a short time, because it is not a scheduled flight.</p>
<p>There are approximately 170,000 refugees here, which is an estimated figure, but it is also close. There are also 10,000 exiled students. When Qingdao was taken over, there were originally many empty enemy properties, and as refugees poured in, various places became overcrowded. Today, it is quite difficult to rent a spare house in Qingdao. The Shandong-Qingdao branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has ended, and the 40,000 people who had previously received assistance have also run out of food, creating a problem. Almost nothing can be done. Various parties have organized a temporary relief association, but words are more than deeds, and it is difficult to cook without rice. It was decided to organize a delegation to Beijing to seek help from the central government, and the municipal government filled 30 million yuan as travel expenses. They requested the central government to allocate funds and food, declaring that they would not return to Qingdao unless they achieved their goals. They also asked Mayor Li Xianliang to take the lead and go to Beijing first to state the local situation. Officials and people worked together to strive for support from the central government. When the weather clears up, they will set off immediately. More than 100,000 starving refugees are hoping that this will lead to a concrete solution. It was previously reported that the central government asked Guangdong Province whether the refugees here could be settled in Hainan Island. This place did not know about it beforehand, but this proves that after the local situation was reported to the central government, the central government was clearly very concerned and was looking for concrete solutions.</p>
<p>At present, the first step is to focus on evacuation, but Qingdao is an isolated island, and 90,000 people have already accepted concrete arrangements, evacuating to the countryside and distributing them to the Baojia system for residence. Although the Shandong-Qingdao branch of the UNRRA is coming to an end, it has recently allocated 30 tons of miscellaneous grains to the evacuation areas, which will be distributed as soon as the refugees arrive. The Relief Association has agreed with the Garrison Command to form the 530 refugee men who were previously trained into a garrison battalion under the command of the Fortress Headquarters. At the same time, the Military Command Area is also continuing to allocate men to the training team for placement.</p>
<p>The Relief Association's cooperation with the refugees has gradually calmed the refugees' disturbances of the past few days. However, Qingdao is nervous, and any slight disturbance makes the general mood uneasy. How to stabilize it requires deep thought and careful planning.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Largest Machinery Factory; Main Products: Engines, Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>— Kaohsiung, July 30th, Air Dispatch. This Newspaper's Reporter, Yang Yu.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the progress of Taiwan's sugar industry, the Japanese established a "Kabushiki Gaisha Taiwan Ironworks" in Kaohsiung in November of the eighth year of the Republic. This was a private factory, but its internal machinery and equipment were top-notch. It undertook the important task of repairing and manufacturing machinery for sugar factories throughout Taiwan, and it performed well. When the Pacific War broke out, in coordination with the Japanese military's invasion frenzy, this ironworks was used as a place for carrying out the machinery industry and shipbuilding industry. Judging from the fact that it initially had 3,000 workers and more than 800 employees, it is not difficult to understand the scale and outline of this largest machinery factory in Taiwan.</p>
<p>New-style Lathes; Japanese Dumped Them into the Sea</p>
<p>Now this factory, along with the Keelung Shipyard, is under the Taiwan Machinery and Shipbuilding Company, and it has been renamed the Kaohsiung Machinery Factory to promote the nascent machinery and shipbuilding industry in Taiwan. In the past, it had such strong strength: its machine tools included 168 lathes, 56 drilling machines, 12 shapers, 14 planers, 32 milling machines, 11 boring machines, 37 grinding machines, and 109 other pieces of equipment, totaling 439 pieces. The shipbuilding department has one each of 60M×40M and 55M×25M docks, as well as 60M×25M and 60M×12 launch platforms. The iron smelting also has two 5-ton iron smelting furnaces, two 3-ton iron smelting furnaces, and one 1-ton electric steel-making furnace. The lifting and transport equipment includes eight 15-ton cranes, five 3-10 ton manual cranes, one 20-ton crane, and a railway that runs directly into the factory, providing a very convenient transportation network. After the bombing, the utilization rate of machine tools only reached about 35%, and many new-style grinding machines were even dismantled by the Japanese and dumped into the sea. However, the production capacity can currently simultaneously build two 170-ton wooden boats, repair one 7,000-ton and one 10,000-ton ship, and melt 100 tons of iron and 20 tons of steel per month.</p>
<p>Weak Purchasing Power; Capital Turnover is Not Flexible</p>
<p>According to Chief Bi of the factory, the current business focuses on manufacturing 115-horsepower and 200-horsepower diesel engines and building 65, 170, and 200-ton fishing boats, as well as repairing railway locomotives. Since the restoration, four 170-ton fishing boats have been completed one after another, but only three have been sold. Fishing Boat No. 4, owned by Taiwan, still has no buyer. A 200-ton fishing boat, including all equipment for engines and fishing gear, sold for 7 million New Taiwan dollars last year. A 65-ton boat sells for 850,000 yuan, and two have been sold to the Shanghai Engineering Company. Chief Bi said that this price cannot be considered expensive. As long as you catch a few fish, you can recover the capital. The reason why sales are not as ideal is still because the purchasing power of the private sector is too weak.</p>
<p>The reporter made a tour of the factory's machine shop, repair shop, electrical steel casting shop, and shipbuilding shop and found that the scope of adaptation of the machines here is extremely wide. It can handle most general casting, forging, machinery processing, and various machine tools with ease. However, because the capital turnover is not flexible, it is difficult for the business to have a high degree of development. Customers do whatever they need, so it is inevitable that the efficiency of the excellent equipment here will be disappointed. The reporter also saw many lathes and drilling machines making irrelevant small parts. The machine factory's own depression lies here.</p>
<p>Promotional Organization; Striving to Seize the Market</p>
<p>Chief Bi also said that without a fixed budget, there is still no way even if the product is profitable. Moreover, apart from engines and fishing boats, there are few fixed products, so there are many inconveniences in terms of parts and work, and it is even more difficult to make money. He also agreed with the reporter's opinion that in order for the business to get on the right track, the promotion organization cannot be located inside the factory and must be located in Shanghai and other places. Seizing the market is to fight for the future of the factory.</p>
<p>Affected by the budget, raw materials have also become a problem. Pig iron, steel plates, round iron, and steel bars are only some of the remaining materials previously shipped from Japan and Northeast China. The total monthly usage is more than 20,000 kilograms. Whether the supply and demand can be smooth in the future depends on whether the factory's business can improve. As for other materials such as wood taken from Alishan, oil, oxygen, and calcium carbide are also supplied by this province, so it seems that there is no shortage at present.</p>
<p>When the reporter was about to say goodbye, Group Leader Xue casually talked about the situation of the more than 1,000 workers here. He said that the average salary is about 5,000 yuan, but the workers here have led several labor strikes in the area, perhaps because they have a higher level of knowledge. But if it is said to be for life, the treatment is already better than other factories. Therefore, personnel management is a very troublesome thing.</p>
<h3>Preferential Talk on Buying Old Ships and Expanding Tonnage</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhendong</p>
<p>Maritime transport is the foundation of a nation. The rise and fall of national fortunes, the prosperity and decline of a nation's industry, commerce, culture, and economy, all depend on the development of its maritime transport industry. Our country's maritime transport industry is still in its infancy, and all facilities have lagged behind others. Before the war, our total tonnage was only over 500,000 tons (including Jardine Matheson, Taikoo Dockyard, and foreign tramp steamers, about 1 million tons, totaling 1.5 million tons). Moreover, due to the constraints of unequal treaties, our navigation rights were seized, causing us pain for decades! Now, after the war, Japan has been defeated, and the world has changed. Unequal treaties have been abolished, and our navigation rights have been recovered. This is truly a great opportunity for our country's maritime transport industry to revive, build, and become self-reliant. Before World War II, Japan's total merchant ship tonnage was 5.5 million tons. Currently, it has about 1.5 million tons. After the recovery, our country has suddenly increased from the remaining 100,000 tons to 800,000 tons, exceeding the pre-war tonnage, which is a good phenomenon. However, this meager amount is far behind the tonnage of various countries in the world. Not only has it not reached the level of advanced countries in the world, but it is also lacking compared to the defeated nation of Japan. If we further consider the necessary supporting facilities such as docks, warehouses, shipbuilding, and repairs, we are even further behind and unable to compete with them. This is truly a disgrace to our country's maritime transport industry. Given the length of our coastline and the vastness of our territory, once the political situation stabilizes and transportation recovers, the above-mentioned tonnage will be insufficient to supply inland and coastal shipping, let alone open up ocean routes and compete with the maritime transport industries of advanced nations.</p>
<p>What is even more regrettable is that our shipbuilding equipment is still in its infancy. There are only five relatively large shipyards: Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard, Qingdao Naval Shipyard, Fuzhou Mawei Shipyard, and two shipyards in Keelung and Kaohsiung. Even for the aforementioned shipyards, the longest dry dock is only 600 feet long, and the maximum tonnage it can accommodate is only 15,000 tons. With such equipment, it is already insufficient to handle ship repairs, let alone mass-produce new ships to meet demand, which is simply impossible.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, in order to meet the urgent needs of shipping and seek tonnage expansion to adapt to this initial need, there is no other way but to purchase foreign ships from abroad. When evaluating foreign old ships for purchase, the age and draft should not be the only criteria. The quality of a ship should be valued over its appearance. The sturdiness of the hull and the excellent performance of the machinery should be the main considerations. It is a well-known fact that the quality and performance of new ships hastily built during wartime to meet urgent needs are often not as good as those of old ships. Therefore, when expanding tonnage, age should not be the sole criterion for selection.</p>
<p>In addition, we sincerely hope that our government will encourage shipping companies to purchase foreign ships, such as providing loans and ship mortgage facilities to shipping companies. For ships that are particularly needed in our country, especially those related to international trade, subsidies or long-term low-interest loans and preferential foreign exchange settlements should be provided. As tonnage is gradually expanded, we should strive to improve the quality and performance of ships and further strengthen shipbuilding equipment. Given time, our country's maritime transport industry will not only replace Japan's position but also compete with the maritime transport industries of advanced nations.</p>

<h3>A Rebellious Assault</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>With the feelings of Liu Bei visiting Zhuge Liang, Liao Dong found Li Hua's teacher and friend, Liu Ziyun, and told Liu Ziyun in detail about his meeting with Li Hua. He begged Liu Ziyun to come forward to salvage the stalemate, save Li Hua, and save him too!</p>
<p>Liu Ziyun understood this situation. She had received a letter from Li Hua, a letter appealing to her. She knew that Director Yang was pursuing Li Hua, and she also knew that Li Hua would never love Director Yang—a national traitor who relied on power to bully others, embezzled and engaged in malfeasance, and hoarded for profit, doing all kinds of evil. Li Hua loved Liao Dong—an aspiring youth, a hero. But even though Li Hua was like this, she knew even better that Li Hua's mother, Mrs. Mo, was not like this. Mrs. Mo did not understand the value of personality, but only worshiped money. Therefore, Mrs. Mo did not need to seek Li Hua's consent, but directly flattered Director Yang, flattering the god of wealth in her mind.</p>
<p>"The problem is not with Director Yang, but with Mrs. Mo. Mrs. Mo wants to recover the losses caused by the war from Director Yang, so she needs to use Li Hua to lure Director Yang, but she may not necessarily let Li Hua marry Director Yang. But Director Yang's money will not be spent in vain. Director Yang's purpose is to marry Li Hua. Mrs. Mo has not thought about these things. Li Hua has thought about them but can do nothing about Mrs. Mo, so Li Hua is in pain!" Liu Ziyun calmly analyzed the key to the problem, while thinking about ways to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>"The problem is already very serious. Allowing it to develop is really too dangerous, Mr. Liu! Please think of a way!"</p>
<p>"What did Li Hua say to you?" Liu Ziyun asked with concern.</p>
<p>"She just told me to save her, to ask you for advice. Therefore, I rushed here overnight. I hope you can help me," Liao Dong said hesitantly, still revealing a kind of shyness.</p>
<p>"I know Li Hua loves you very much," Liu Ziyun said calmly, "but Mrs. Mo may not necessarily love you, so first you must establish a good relationship with Mrs. Mo, so that she has a good impression of you, and then your problem with Li Hua can have further development."</p>
<p>"What if I propose to Li Hua now?"</p>
<p>"Li Hua cannot make the decision."</p>
<p>"Then I will ask Mrs. Mo to agree."</p>
<p>Liu Ziyun thought for a while, and then said to Liao Dong:</p>
<p>"Okay, tomorrow I will accompany you to Chongqing. Let me first explore Mrs. Mo's intentions, and then act accordingly. Now I will accompany you to see my friend, also Li Hua's friend, Mr. Dong Shaoling. He may have better ideas; and we will need his help in the future."</p>
<p>So, Liao Dong followed Liu Ziyun to visit Dong Shaoling. Liao Dong had met Dong Shaoling in Wuhan. After this in-depth conversation, their impressions of each other were very good. Liao Dong respected Dong Shaoling as a teacher, and Dong Shaoling also loved Liao Dong very much, just as Dong Shaoling encouraged Li Hua to wait patiently for Liao Dong. He also advised Liao Dong not to relax his pursuit of Li Hua. Dong Shaoling's idea was that as long as Li Hua was ambitious, she should not be afraid of Mrs. Mo's opposition; Dong Shaoling even suggested that Liao Dong should get engaged to Li Hua immediately. Of course, Li Hua must obtain Mrs. Mo's consent. If Mrs. Mo agreed, then that was that. If she did not agree, then a third party should come forward to mediate. Dong Shaoling's suggestion was exactly what Liao Dong wanted. Liu Ziyun felt that doing this was too uncertain, and it would be better to first establish a good relationship with Mrs. Mo and then slowly proceed. Liao Dong was impatient, and at the same time, because of the constraints of his work, he could not often approach Mrs. Mo, so he estimated that it would be difficult to have a connection. However, Dong Shaoling came up with a compromise method, which was to proceed on two fronts. On the one hand, Li Hua should express her feelings to Mrs. Mo clearly, and on the other hand, Liao Dong should try his best to ingratiate himself with Mrs. Mo and cater to her wishes.</p>
<p>Liao Dong was very grateful to Dong Shaoling for this enthusiastic instruction. The next day, Qingping hurriedly left Beibei with Liu Ziyun and arrived in Chongqing at noon. Liu Ziyun taught him to buy some gifts to give to Mrs. Mo, because Liu Ziyun knew that Mrs. Mo loved small bargains. Ingratiation must start with gifts. Sure enough, this time when he saw Mrs. Mo, she treated him much more warmly than last time and invited him to have dinner. During dinner, he expressed his love for Li Hua to Mrs. Mo in every possible way and explained his friendship with Li Hua's brother, Bao Ling. Now he was willing to replace Bao Ling in being filial to Mrs. Mo. He said very sincerely:</p>
<p>"Brother Bao Ling and I grew up together since childhood, and our relationship is as close as siblings. His mother is like my mother, and I happen to be a person without a mother, so I will definitely treat you as my own biological mother,"</p>
<p>"I dare not accept that, Mr. Liao!" Mrs. Mo said modestly.</p>
<p>At this time, Li Hua did not say a word. After dinner, she hurriedly went to the theater with her younger sister, Li Yun. Liao Dong sent them off, partly because he wanted to talk to Li Hua on the way, and partly to listen to Li Hua sing "Cosmic Peak" that night. After they left, only Liu Ziyun and Mrs. Mo were left. Liu Ziyun took the opportunity to conduct exploratory work with Mrs. Mo.</p>
<p>"Liao Dong is a very honest and ambitious young man," Liu Ziyun first praised Liao Dong. "He likes Xiao Hua very much, and Xiao Hua is not bad to him either. I think, since you are from the same hometown, and he and Bao Ling are good friends, why not become relatives? - What do you think, old lady?"</p>
<p>"You mean to be a matchmaker for Liao Dong and marry Xiao Hua to him?" Mrs. Mo asked with some surprise, staring at her eyes.</p>
<p>"It's not really being a matchmaker. Anyway, they have known each other for a long time. But I think they are quite suitable."</p>
<p>"Do you think Xiao Hua would be willing? You know her temper," Mrs. Mo asked again with a sly smile.</p>
<p>"Xiao Hua will definitely be willing. She expressed it to me and to Bao Ling a long time ago! Because she also feels that Liao Dong is a promising and promising young man, she is just embarrassed to say it to you," Liu Ziyun replied calmly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo was even more surprised and stunned. She was silent for a while, then said half-believingly:</p>
<p>"She would be willing to marry him?"</p>
<p>"Why not? She likes Liao Dong, and besides, she is old enough to get married,"</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true. Xiao Hua is only twenty-eight years old," Mrs. Mo said with some dissatisfaction. "Nowadays is not like in the past. It's not too late for a girl to get married at thirty."</p>
<p>"Unless the girl herself is willing, otherwise, parents cannot force her to wait until thirty to get married," Liu Ziyun began to argue.</p>
<p>"I didn't force Xiao Hua to wait until thirty to get married. But I don't believe that she really likes Liao Dong."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You forgot, so many rich and powerful people liked her in the past, and now there is Director Yang who is still infatuated with her, but she refuses to marry. Is she crazy, choosing and choosing and choosing a Liao Dong who has nothing? I don't believe it," Mrs. Mo said firmly.</p>
<p>"You don't understand Xiao Hua. What she dislikes most are those 'rich and powerful' people who treat women as toys and vases. What she wants to marry is a young man like Liao Dong who 'has nothing' but has passion and loyalty. You can ask her if you don't believe me. Because I know it very clearly, I dare to tell you this. Now, as long as you agree, there is definitely no problem with her,"</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo didn't expect that the problem was placed on her shoulders. She frowned and considered for a while, then answered Liu Ziyun very resolutely.</p>
<p>"I don't agree."</p>
<p>"What's the reason?" Liu Ziyun asked relentlessly.</p>
<p>"I don't like this person," Mrs. Mo said without hesitation.</p>
<p>"But, I said, Xiao Hua likes him. It's useless if you don't like him. Because this is Xiao Hua's personal lifelong matter," Liu Ziyun retorted firmly.</p>
<p>"For Xiao Hua's sake, she shouldn't marry someone like Liao Dong. First," Mrs. Mo pondered for a moment and said, "Liao Dong can't support Xiao Hua. Second, Liao Dong is an air force pilot. He doesn't know if he will be alive tomorrow; therefore, I can't let Xiao Hua take this risk. Besides, it's not time for her to retire yet. Her art is important. Since I am her mother, I can make half of her decisions." Mrs. Mo was a little angry in the end!</p>
<p>"Your reasons are not valid, Aunt! You only see that Liao Dong doesn't have money now, but you don't see that Liao Dong is a promising young man, and his future is very bright. As for your concern that the air force is dangerous, but in wartime, even if he is not an air force pilot, life is just as dangerous. Have you forgotten that Bao Ling died in a bombing? On the contrary, air force pilots are safer as long as they have good skills and rich experience. Speaking of Xiao Hua's art, she doesn't necessarily have to retire after getting married; Liao Dong is also a person who loves art, and he will not interfere with Xiao Hua's singing. It's just that Xiao Hua herself is already tired of it. Therefore, I advise you to make it a success for them. If you don't want them to get married immediately, it's the same if you let them get engaged first."</p>
<p>Liu Ziyun's words had already aroused Mrs. Mo's resentment. Like five or six years ago in Kaifeng, she felt that Liu Ziyun was again there engaging in teaching Xiao Hua to betray her. Therefore, she really wanted to contradict Liu Ziyun a few words, but she didn't dare; what she was afraid of was not Liu Ziyun, but Li Hua. She knew Li Hua's temper. Making her angry would make things worse. These days, Li Hua had already quarreled with her several times over the problem of Director Yang.</p>
<p>"I think, this matter doesn't need to be too urgent. Let them get to know each other more. As long as Xiao Hua is willing, I, as a mother, can't control much," Mrs. Mo suppressed her dissatisfaction and reluctantly perfunctorily said.</p>
<p>"But as far as I know, they already have a very deep understanding and a very good relationship. Since you don't hold on to preconceived notions, it's just a matter of time, then it's still my original meaning, let them get engaged first," Liu Ziyun said, seeing that Mrs. Mo had already made concessions, and then pressed closer.</p>
<p>"It's not that easy, Mr. Liu!" Mrs. Mo finally blocked Liu Ziyun's mouth, not allowing Liu Ziyun to continue.</p>
<p>At night, when Li Hua came back after singing, Liu Ziyun told Feng Hua about her conversation with Mrs. Mo, asking Li Hua to express her feelings to Mrs. Mo directly again, at least forcing Mrs. Mo to agree to the engagement. Li Luo felt very sad after listening to Liu Ziyun's words, knowing that this was no different from her life and death juncture, so she quietly decided to have a most courageous fight with fate.</p>
<p>The next day, Li Hua was just about to prepare to talk to Mrs. Mo about the problem when Director Yang happened to come. Li Hua quickly hid. In the inner room, Li Hua eavesdropped on Director Yang enticing Ms. Tai to marry Li Hua to him. He said that his ex-wife had died for more than a year and he had not remarried because his conditions were very high, and it was not easy to find a suitable one. Now that he had fallen in love with Li Hua, he was willing to marry Li Hua and was responsible for Ms. Mo's life, and everyone could live together, and he could treat Ms. Mo as his own mother and be filial to her. He also talked about his real estate in Sichuan, hundreds of acres of land in Chengdu, a villa in Huangshan on the South Bank, and two houses in Chongqing. There are also commercial shareholders, bank loans, etc. A series of sweet words made Ms. Mo covetous, but she could not make a decision like selling goods and immediately agree to marry Li Hua to him. At the same time, she really couldn't bear to refuse such a good opportunity. It would have been fine without Liao Dong's interjection yesterday, but with Liao Dong's interjection, Ms. Mo had to seize this opportunity first. Because in this way, Director Yang could be used to deal with Liao Dong. So Ms. Tai told him that she was willing to take the lead in promoting this matter, but it still needed Li Hua's own consent. At this point, Li Hua rushed out like a whirlwind. Not knowing where the courage came from, she went straight to Ms. Mo.</p>
<p>"Mom, how can you say that!" Li Hua said sternly. Then she turned to Director Yang. "Director Yang, please don't believe her words. She can't make any decisions about my affairs. Although she is my mother, I have reached the legal age, and she has no right to interfere with my freedom. I have heard everything you just talked about. Now let me give you a solemn reply. That is absolutely impossible. So please don't waste your time."</p>
<p>"Why?" Director Yang couldn't help but ask in surprise.</p>
<p>"Because I already have someone I like, and I am going to get engaged to him," Li Hua said decisively.</p>
<p>"Xiao Hua!" Ms. Mo hurriedly shouted to stop her.</p>
<p>"Don't you believe me? Mom! Then, let me tell you again clearly, the person I love is Liao Dong, an air force pilot who has no money, no power, only passion, only loyalty. I am going to get engaged to him; because we are a combination of emotions, not a combination of trade. So there are absolutely no conditions between us," Li Hua said in one breath, finishing the words that had been suffocating in her heart for a long time.</p>
<p>"Okay!" After hearing Li Hua's words, Director Yang left, feeling angry and ashamed, without even saying goodbye.</p>
<p>With this, Ms. Mo was really anxious and hateful, and her face changed color. She almost raised her hand to hit Li Hua, rushed to her, and shouted loudly, trembling:</p>
<p>"I don't allow it, I don't allow you to want to marry whoever you want without regard to shame!"</p>
<p>"It's useless if you don't allow it, Mom! Liao Zhong and I already have a relationship, so I have to marry him."</p>
<p>"Xiao Hua!". Even Liu Ziyun, who had quietly walked in, shouted in surprise.</p>
<p>"Ah!". At the same time, Ms. Tai screamed and fainted to the ground.</p>
<p>Yes, no one thought that Li Hua would say such a thing, and even she herself didn't know what power made her so brave. She really blurted it out. Seeing Ms. Mo arbitrarily opposed her, she used such a reason that Ms. Mo despised to perfunctorily, and also cleared Liao Dong of responsibility. It was really too unbelievable. She finally made the most firm and resolute rebellious assault on Ms. Mo and on her own destiny!</p>
<h3>Ode to Yu Jianhua's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>I have been separated from Jianhua for ten years. We met again at sea, and talked about the past as if it were yesterday; and Yu Zi's art has continued to improve. He has traveled to famous mountains and rivers in the universe, immersed himself in smoke and clouds, and his brush has participated in creation, almost breaking through the boundaries of the ancients and establishing a unique style. On the occasion of this solo exhibition, I write a sentence in response to his teachings:</p>
<p>Mount Tai and Mount Song Hua sing of majestic travels,</p>
<p>Thousands of rocks and ravines are collected in the car,</p>
<p>There is a misty atmosphere in the chest;</p>
<p>What else to seek from Dong Yuan and Juran, Jing Hao and Guan Tong?</p>
<h3>Layers of Mountains and Valleys</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<h3>Casual Brush Strokes on a Summer Day</h3>
<p>— Suiyun</p>
<p>Mosquitoes</p>
<p>On a hot day, the naked people slept very sweetly. Swarms of mosquitoes flew around their faces and bodies, buzzing and sucking their blood. Those sleeping people generally don't pay much attention to them.</p>
<p>——The "cultivation" of the Chinese people is really too great.</p>
<p>Similarly, great virtues are naturally not limited to the "mosquitoes" alone.</p>
<p>Maggots</p>
<p>It's the season for maggots to be active again.</p>
<p>It is true that maggots are disgusting things, but from this point of view, are human beings all respectable and lovable?</p>
<p>I'm afraid not ——</p>
<p>Maggots only rely on the waste excreted by human beings as their survival data, but certain higher animals are fattening their limbs in a pool of blood and sweat!</p>
<p>Flies</p>
<p>The fly is a hero, the reason is very simple—</p>
<p>It has the perseverance to fly back even when driven away.</p>
<p>It will buzz incessantly in the face of a dying warrior, and it has the courage to lick the flesh and blood of a dead warrior.</p>
<p>Its survival power is particularly strong, and tens of thousands of descendants can all survive in the muddy environment...</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 338</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>When Mr. W heard me ask such a question, he immediately stopped, glanced at me, picked out a military map, spread it on his desk, and pointed it to me: "... This fur surface can be said to have five points of good fortune and five points of luck - this is not a bad sign, in the future, it will definitely defeat the dwarf devils -" Mr. Ding W was a little excited.</p>
<p>I moved my seat over to see where this five points of good fortune was.</p>
<p>"Probably the devils are superstitious about this 'eight', and they believe it to the extreme. On the one hand, they are joining in the fun, preparing to respond to the launch of 'the secret of eight', and on the other hand, they are following the original military plan, preparing to launch the northwest offensive on August 8 as the vanguard of the Zhengzhou Battle:"</p>
<p>"I am not a military strategist. Although I signed the Tanaka Memorial and heard Tsurumi talk about the Japanese army's invasion plan, the general idea is to 'fight quickly and decisively'. Since it is a quick and decisive battle, I just don't understand why they have to make such a big circle, detour to Taiyuan, Shanxi, to meet in Zhengzhou and Wuhan? Wouldn't it be easier to go directly south along the Pinghan Road?"</p>
<p>"No, marching cannot be greedy for convenience;" Mr. W put down the topic of "five points of good fortune," sat down on his solid seat on the spot, and stroked the map spread out with one hand, with the air of Zhuge Liang on the stage saying, "I have something to say, and you should listen to it:"</p>
<p>"Fighting along the communication line, the most fearful thing is the enemy's large army attacking from the side. Please think, although the army in Shanxi is a bit old, Liu Ruming's 29th Army is currently controlling the gateway to northern Shanxi, Tang Enbo's 13th Army is blocking the key northwest passes, and Chuan Zuoyang's iron cavalry is holding the important town of Sui Jin; and these three parties, as well as Elder Yan's other elite troops, are all waiting for mobilization. You think the Japanese devils also have quite sharp military eyes, can it be that he only cares about going south to meet and doesn't worry about these few large armies rushing out and cutting them into several sections? For this reason, he has to fight Shanxi first. The strategy of fighting Shanxi is clamping, on the one hand, slowly going south from Pinghan, on the other hand, the enemy troops going south from Pingsui and Zhangbei will meet in Datong, and then directly take Taiyuan, go down Tongguan, and meet in Zhengzhou with the Pinghan route. In this way, the main force going south has no worries." "... Moreover, there are Shanxi's resources..."</p>
<p>"The Japanese spies were desperately sneaking into Taiyuan and Datong batch by batch, and they were originally doing the paving work," I interjected, adding this sentence.</p>
<p>"It's not just paving the way. If we don't disturb them again from both sides, the main force of the Japanese army can simply enter directly without bloodshed and take half of the northwest with ease!" Mr. W sneered.</p>
<p>"Brother's 'five points of good fortune' refers to this?" I asked somewhat numbly.</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— By Min Yangzhi</p>
<p>Dusk, the half-fallen setting sun, clings to the vast mountain peaks. Piles and piles of tangerine-red evening glow lightly smear the pale blue sky.</p>
<p>It is a summer dusk!…</p>
<p>Loneliness and emptiness, I have forgotten the seasons and time, buried the splendor of youth, and given a part of my life to the flowing light of the stars. It is as if in a snow-covered wilderness, death and coldness offer not a hint of warmth.</p>
<p>In the open space outside my home, many people sit in a circle, men and women, talking and laughing, adorning the boundless liveliness of the summer evening. The girls' thick black hair dances in the gentle breeze, and the young women's fair, tender arms and thighs are bathed in the golden light of the setting sun...</p>
<p>And so I began to be silent.</p>
<p>"To whom does this cool summer evening belong?"</p>
<p>Raising my head again in loneliness, the setting sun has already bid farewell to the mountains. A few pale yellow clouds float in the sky, and a falcon flies by, as if carrying a light silk, spreading its wings evenly and swiftly piercing the clouds.</p>
<p>And so I sigh at this distant world...</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Reading Poetry</h3>
<p>— By Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Zuo Si's "Rhapsody on the Capital of Wu" says: "A giant tortoise supports the tablet, with cloud peaks crowning its head." Yuan Yi's poem: "Further crowning the peaks with its head," uses this event. According to Yang Shen's Outer Collection, the dragon has nine sons, each with its own preference. One, Bixi, likes to carry heavy objects, hence it is found under the base of steles today. However, Li Dongyang's "Huai Lutang Collection" and Shen Defu's "Wild Harvest Compilation" both state that the weight-bearer is named Baxia, while Bixi likes literature, hence it is the one winding around the stele. This is likely based on unfounded rumors, hence the inconsistent stories.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand Yuan Disaster Relief Movement</h3>
<p>— By Shi Lang</p>
<p>Guangdong and Guangxi are experiencing severe floods, Shanxi is experiencing drought, and in Chengdu, due to the flooding of the Jinjiang River, more than a thousand residents in the urban area have perished. The Chinese people are truly in a state of being boiled in water and scorched by fire. This metaphor, as it appears now, is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The floods in the disaster areas of Guangdong and Guangxi are widespread. The exact number of disaster victims is still unknown. Taking Guangxi Province as a whole, famine plus floods have resulted in over 1.5 million victims. The drought in Shanxi has affected as many as five million people.</p>
<p>Looking at the disasters in various places from the extravagant perspective of Shanghai, we truly feel indescribable shame! It is said that in the disaster areas of Guangxi, a small child is sold for only ten thousand yuan. Based on Shanghai's rice price of 500,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), this ten thousand yuan is only worth two sheng (a unit of volume) of rice, but in the disaster area, it can buy a life! On any given night, the amount spent in Shanghai's extravagant dance halls must be appalling. Hotels, dance halls, theaters—who is not indulging in extreme pleasure, who has ever even briefly considered that millions of our compatriots are struggling on the brink of death?</p>
<p>If we could, in these places, each person save ten thousand yuan to donate to the disaster victims in Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, and other places, what would it mean to us?</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to appeal to all the people of Shanghai: let's start a ten thousand yuan disaster relief movement. We appeal to the clear-headed, conscientious men and women of Shanghai to voluntarily donate ten thousand yuan each to help our suffering compatriots!</p>

<h3>Stopping Bacterial Attacks—A New Drug for Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— By Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw a news item in this newspaper about a new drug for treating tuberculosis, which said: "United Press International, Atlantic, 30th: Dr. Born reported at the American College of Chest Physicians that the latest "miracle drug" invention—Streptomycin—can treat two types of tuberculosis, namely military tuberculosis (?) and pediatric tuberculosis."</p>
<p>After reading it, I couldn't help but smile. In this world of "military first" (not safety first), the so-called military tuberculosis has actually appeared, which is ridiculous. It must be a translator's error.</p>
<p>The original text is Miliary Tuberculosis. The word Miliary is not Milityary, with a T in between. This word Miliary cannot be found in English-Chinese dictionaries. It comes from the Latin word Miliaris, which means millet seed, describing its small size and ability to form countless diseases. This type of TB, when spreading, can attack any organ in the body, even the membrane surrounding the brain.</p>
<p>The so-called Streptomycin is a miracle drug for treating tuberculosis. It has been tested with great success in the past two years. Hundreds of TB patients have been cured, and it has now begun to be sold in the United States.</p>
<p>Streptomycin is derived from the same component as penicillin, so it can be considered part of the penicillin family, but its composition is not as complex and regular as penicillin's.</p>
<p>Streptomycin is simply a "miracle drug" for treating ordinary tuberculosis. Within a few weeks, sometimes even a few days after starting treatment, the fever subsides, the cough stops, the appetite returns, and the patient begins to gain weight. Microscopic examination of his saliva shows that there are no TB bacteria. X-rays indicate that the TB spots in the lungs have disappeared.</p>
<p>According to a report from "Science Service," a 19-year-old girl developed severe TB that affected the lymph nodes in her neck. Within three months, the bacteria attacked the membrane around the girl's heart. In the past, very few people with such severe illnesses would survive, and complete recovery was simply impossible.</p>
<p>Five days after starting Streptomycin treatment, the high fever began to subside. According to her doctor, her symptoms had disappeared "completely and astonishingly." The bacteria that had been found in the fluid near her heart, in her blood, and in her lymph nodes had also disappeared. Five months later, the treatment was completed, and the girl returned home and recovered.</p>
<p>Here is another fact: Last October, a nursing school student contracted tuberculosis. She lost weight, often felt very tired, and began to cough. Every afternoon, her temperature increased.</p>
<p>In November, X-rays showed spots in her lungs. Although she rested in bed, her condition worsened. On December 16, X-rays showed that there was a hole in one of her lungs.</p>
<p>On December 17, Streptomycin treatment began. A month later, the nursing student was cured. The X-ray on January 21 of this year showed that there was no longer a hole in her lungs. The symptoms of TB bacteria were also gone, and she had recovered her health.</p>
<p>Another fact is that a 23-year-old man contracted tuberculosis. X-rays showed that there was a hole in his lung that was almost an inch in diameter.</p>
<p>The day after starting treatment with Streptomycin, six weeks later, the X-rays showed a completely different picture. The hole was gone, the fluid had almost completely disappeared, TB bacteria were no longer found in his body, and six months later, the report said—he was still improving—gradually resuming his daily activities.</p>
<p>For doctors, Streptomycin is not technically a "cure" for tuberculosis! It is a bacteria-stopping drug, or so-called bactericide. It stops the growth of bacteria, stops the bacteria from attacking the body, and gives the body a chance to recover.</p>
<p>Streptomycin is not completely effective. Sometimes, a patient's condition suddenly worsens during recovery. In this case, the bacteria begin to resist, and the drug is no longer effective.</p>
<p>This is what researchers of Streptomycin consider to be the biggest problem. This is the same problem that is encountered when using penicillin to treat tuberculosis. The medical community is experimenting with a new drug called Grisein, a drug closely related to Streptomycin. Doctors hope that when TB bacteria resist, another drug can enter and complete the "treatment" work. Whether it will succeed remains to be seen!</p>
<h3>The Famous Scholar Kong Rong—Miscellaneous Essays on Figures of the Wei and Jin Dynasties, No. 3</h3>
<p>— Leng Zhou</p>
<p>Although the literati of the Wei and Jin dynasties generally maintained a clear and beautiful style, careful study reveals that their actions can be divided into two factions: one faction saw through the changes of the world, spent their days in wine, medicine, mountains, and waters, indulging in unrestrained freedom, living a detached life; the other faction, however, hung up the sheep's head but sold dog meat, upholding the signboard of famous scholars, using it to form cliques, mutually promoting each other, as a stepping stone to advancement. Kong Rong is a representative of the latter faction.</p>
<p>As the Continued Book of the Later Han says: "Rong's arguments based on the classics were not as good as Rang and others, but his talent and erudition surpassed them." The so-called outstanding talent is just superficial talk without substance. There is a typical record in Volume 12 of the Book of Wei:</p>
<p>"Rong initially possessed extraordinary talent. At that time, Li Ying, the magistrate of Henan, had a great reputation and ordered his subordinates to screen guests, refusing to see anyone who was not a contemporary hero or a descendant of a prominent family. Rong, who was just over ten years old, wanted to observe his character, so he went to Ying's door and said to the doorman: I am a family friend of Lord Li. Ying saw Rong and asked: Have your father and grandfather ever interacted with me? Rong said: Yes! My ancestor Confucius and your ancestor Laozi shared the same virtues and principles, and were teachers and friends to each other. Therefore, Rong and you are family friends for generations. Everyone present was amazed. Chen Wei, a grand master of the court, arrived later. The people present told Wei about Rong. Wei said: Those who are clever when they are young may not be extraordinary when they grow up. Rong replied: According to what you say, were you really intelligent when you were young? Ying laughed loudly and said to Wei: You will surely become a great talent when you grow up."</p>
<p>From this, we can see Kong Rong's skill in colluding with powerful nobles and being good at using his tongue. However, although he refuted Chen Wei at the time, it was proven afterwards that Chen Wei's criticism of him was very accurate. This is not only seen in the fact that he could not become a "great talent," but also that he was executed by Cao Cao with the charge of "going against heaven and reason, corrupting morality," and did not die a good death. According to Sima Biao's Spring and Autumn Annals of Kyushu:</p>
<p>"When Rong was in Beihai, he aspired to great ambitions, established roots, and refused to be mediocre. However, those he appointed were curious and unorthodox, all of them frivolous talents. As for scholars who were versed in the classics, he pretended to be respectful, and although he treated them with full courtesy, he did not discuss state affairs with them... Lofty discussions of teachings and decrees filled the offices. His words and tone were gentle and lovely, but the examination of matters and the execution of affairs were difficult to implement."</p>
<p>This vividly portrays his character of being good at putting on a facade but not being practical, saying nice things but being a good-for-nothing. But this is not enough. There are several more wonderful supplements in Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms:</p>
<p>"...When the Yellow Turban bandits were about to arrive, Rong drank a lot of strong wine, personally mounted his horse, and resisted them above the Lai River. The bandit commander ordered his troops to confront Rong. The two wings crossed the river and went straight to the city wall along the river. The city fell, and Rong could not enter... The city was attacked by Yuan Tan. From spring to summer, the city was small and the bandits were numerous. Arrows fell like rain, but Rong sat calmly on his chair, reading and discussing as if nothing was happening. The people of the city fled, and he fled to Shandong, and his family was captured by Tan."</p>
<p>If you don't read the following, and only talk about the style of his opening moves, it is really something, and it is the first to win people over. But the results were the same twice, and he was defeated twice. The wind is strong and the thunder is weak. Kong Rong probably relied on this kind of posture to scare off the enemy, right?</p>
<p>Drinking heavily and bravely mounting his horse are commendable; remaining calm in the face of danger and responding calmly are admirable; but this requires a premise, that is, the enemy retreats in the face of the crowd, and the change is resolved in response to the change. Otherwise, pretending to be fat when your face is swollen is a matter of pride, to put it nicely, but in reality, isn't it just like what Bao Puzi said in Han Guo Su Li: "Those who are beautifully dressed and charming, but have no heart, are called擬神明徹 (imitating divine clarity); those who are eloquent and clever, and cater to others with skillful words, are called 標領淸妍 (leading the way to beauty); those who form cliques and praise each other, and whose actions contradict their words, are called 以為會友 (thinking they are friends); those who rely on powerful relatives and whose positions exceed their talents are called 四豪之匹 (equal to the four heroes)." These several "what is called" (謂之) are not worth a penny when you break them down. Is that what you call a famous scholar?</p>
<h3>A Medley of American Life</h3>
<p>— By Xu Shu</p>
<p>The American Postal Service</p>
<p>My admiration for the excellence of the American postal service is not just admiration, it is downright worship, because I am constantly on the move, averaging once a month. During the war, letters from Chengdu, relayed through Kunming, India, and Africa, took at least two months to arrive. With all the transferring, it took three months to receive them, but in five years, not a single letter was lost. There are many cities with the same name in small American towns, such as Glendale, which has several. If the province is not specified in the letter, it is first sent to Glendale, California, and finally transferred to Glendale, Arizona. By the time the letter arrives, I have already moved several times, and the letter always follows me. The post office keeps a forwarding address for every departing soldier. Often, a letter is transferred to dozens of places, but it is still delivered to the addressee. It is never like the post offices in mainland China, which burn undeliverable letters (editor's note: in fact, this is not entirely the case). In fact, I am afraid that the postal authorities are simply too lazy to track down the addressee.</p>
<p>In the United States, you can enclose American dollar bills in a letter, affix three cents of postage, and send it. Diamond rings can also be sent as parcels without registering, and there is no worry of loss or exchange. When shipping a trunk through the post office, you can hand the key over to the post office, and the clothes in your trunk will never turn into tiles. But when you send letters or packages from the United States to China, you must register them, otherwise, the letter will be destroyed because someone likes the American postage stamp on the envelope. If you send a package, then your package will be robbed. I sent more than a dozen packages from the United States to Chengdu, but only one box of Western medicine arrived after I returned to the country. It turned out that the Western medicine had long expired and was worthless, but when I went to pick it up, I had to pay several dollars in postage and a lot in customs duties. (Fourteen)</p>
<h3>The Surviving Family of Zhu Xinggong</h3>
<p>— By Wang Dian</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, many journalists who refused to submit to the threats and temptations of the enemy and puppet regime were martyred. Zhu Xinggong was one of them.</p>
<p>When Shanghai was filled with isolated islands, Zhu Xinggong was working as the night light supplement editor at the American-owned Da Mei Evening News. Although the environment was harsh, he still risked danger and did his best to expose the conspiracies of the enemy and puppet regime, comparing Wang Jingwei to King Lu of the Southern Song Dynasty, who sold out the country for personal gain. Therefore, he was suspected by the enemy and puppet regime and suffered despicable and shameless attacks.</p>
<p>First, Zhang, Wang Jingwei's sworn brother, came forward to invite Zhu Xinggong to be the editor of a puppet newspaper, claiming that the salary was generous and that he only needed to write one article a week supporting the enemy and puppet regime. Zhu Xinggong not only firmly refused, but also wrote an article denouncing Wang Jingwei and his pawns. Seeing that the lure of profit was unsuccessful, Wang Jingwei and his henchmen resorted to threats. In addition to receiving three threatening letters one after another, Zhang also pretended to invite Zhu Xinggong to a banquet, and those accompanying him were all officers of the puppet army. When the banquet ended, Zhang suddenly asked Zhu Xinggong for a wedding photo. Zhu Xinggong agreed at the time.</p>
<p>When he returned home and explained the situation to his wife, he felt that things were a bit strange, but since he had agreed, he could not break his promise. Moreover, under the circumstances at the time, he knew that this was a conspiracy, but he could not deny it. After much deliberation, he decided to send Zhang a photo of himself.</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 1939, Zhu Xinggong, as usual, put on his tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, took the manuscript he had just written, and took the tram to the Da Mei Evening News. However, less than half an hour later, he was shot and killed, a bullet piercing his right temple, and he was martyred at the tram stop.</p>
<p>Zhu Xinggong's wife now lives in Hangzhou and is a neighbor of the writer. The above is all what Mrs. Zhu told the writer in person. Now, the dead are indeed dead, but the living have fallen into distress. In the home in Hangzhou, in addition to Mrs. Zhu herself, there is also a five-year-old child named Yongyong, who is currently studying at the Shanghai Xinlu Normal School. Since her husband's martyrdom, Mrs. Zhu has become quite depressed due to the lack of support. She fasts and worships Buddha every day, spending her lonely years. However, in the current situation of high prices, although her son's schooling is provided by public funds, the clothes and other expenses, as well as her own three meals a day, are difficult to maintain. Therefore, she has to make some matchboxes and other handicrafts to supplement the family's expenses. The situation is tragic.</p>
<p>The government once issued a pension of 30,000 yuan to commend the loyal and martyred journalists, but it is said that it has not yet been received to this day. Even if you get this 30,000 yuan, you can't even buy a dou (a unit of volume) of white rice. Mrs. Zhu always burst into tears when she talked about this matter. She said that her husband died for the country, but the country has forgotten the life of his surviving family. These are extremely sad words.</p>
<p>Seeing the living conditions of Zhu Xinggong's surviving family, one can also imagine the surviving families of other martyred journalists. If the government wants to stabilize the lives of the surviving families and ensure that they have no complaints, then it is necessary to reconsider the issue of pensions. At the very least, it should allow the surviving families to live a good life, so that the martyred patriots can rest in peace in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>Humorous Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Gong Kou</p>
<p>Backfired</p>
<p>Old Zhang came to the writing room with an angry look on his face. His colleagues felt very strange and asked him, "Why are you so unhappy this morning?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing," he replied, "I just cut my hand with a safety razor, burned my clothes with a safety match, and almost dropped dead when I saw a sign that said 'Safety First When Driving'!"</p>
<h3>Arctic Sketches</h3>
<p>— Pu Lun</p>
<p>Looking at a map, we can see that the distances between the eastern and western hemispheres at the two poles of the earth are very close; at the same time, we can see that most of the continents on the earth are distributed in the northern hemisphere, making the Arctic a passage between continents. Many years ago and even now, many dreamers and explorers have explored the two poles with a very strong scientific interest.</p>
<p>The history of the Arctic is short and simple. The first to develop the Arctic were the Pytheas, a Greek branch, who reached northern Norway; the time was 325 BC. There, they proved a cold, forever sunless and perennially frozen fact. The next to be examined were the Norsemen; then the British; then the Russians and Americans. At that time, the British wanted to find a road to China for trade; many of their sailors, whalers, and developers outlined the Arctic: the Arctic is like a large bowl-shaped sea that connects the edges of the continents of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>Although the Arctic Ocean has five trillion tons of ice, and the temperature in Siberia is below ninety degrees, the cold Arctic is not as cold as we imagine. According to polar expert Hubert Wilkins, the average temperature in the Arctic during the hottest season is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Indeed, the Arctic summer is quite comfortable. Except for the northern Dakotas, most of the Arctic is warm, even in winter; and hurricanes rarely occur. At the same time, there is not much snow; sometimes, there are only nine feet of snow a year. In the Arctic, as in other southern places, it often rains. In northern Siberia, bayberries grow as big as plums. Even Soviet scientists have a professor named Tsitsim who has discovered a new seed that can grow in the Arctic.</p>
<p>The natural resources of the Arctic are very rich. Although there are no precise statistics on the quantity, the main raw materials of industry contain many types.</p>
<p>Belonging to the US zone, central Alaska has farms that have been cultivated with great success. Some of the best farmland in the world belongs to the northern part of Canada's Great Slave Lake, but most of it has not yet been reclaimed. Alaska also has countless square miles of uninhabited land. Its area is twelve times larger than that of New York State, but the total population is only 80,000, and the white population is only 33,000.</p>
<p>The Arctic region also has countless places, growing tall, lush, uncut trees; various kinds of islands, and countless wild animals. And the waters of the Arctic Ocean ripple, producing many kinds of fish, even whales.</p>
<p>As for the military minerals, there is no need to say more. North America's natural resources include Alaskan gold and iron, and one of the world's largest copper mines. The North American zone also has radium and coal mines, and part of the coal mines may be oil fields. In Canada, important resources are radium and uranium. The Soviet zone has rich coal mines and oil fields. Norilsk has copper and nickel mines; and Lena has gold mines. If the Soviet Union succeeds in obtaining radium mines in the Arctic, it will be even more remarkable.</p>
<p>The eastern part of the Arctic is almost entirely in the Soviet zone. Since the time of Caesar, the Russians have been developing the surface resources of these places in a scientific manner. They hope that the Soviet Arctic can be self-sufficient. Several years ago, the Soviet Union was always ahead of the United States in developing the Arctic.</p>
