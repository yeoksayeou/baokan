<h3>田糧會議舉行大會　主席說明征糧意義　張羣宣讀糧政要點九項</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕蔣主席廿七日上午十時出席三十六年度田糧會議，對全體出席人員訓話。略謂、政府爲達成戡亂救民之任務，必先足食足兵，故征糧征兵、實爲今後地方政府之兩大中心工作。各省主席及田糧主管人員，必須羣起，責以改進田糧業務，革除過去弊端，以期能確實符合公平之原則，並望各省參議會及地方士紳，多方協助，俾政令得順利推行。而尤要者，在政府人員與士紳以身作則率先奉行政府法令，繳納田糧，服行兵役，以爲人民之倡導。如此乃能達成足食足兵之目的，完成統一建國之大業。</p>
<p>〔又電〕卅六年度田糧會議廿七日上午九時在行政院大禮堂開幕，到各省政府主席，參議會議長，田糧處長及中樞首長王雲五，白崇禧，陳誠，兪飛鵬，兪鴻鈞，徐堪，吳鼎昌甘乃光，龐松舟，陳良等八十餘人。張院長主席並致開幕詞，略謂此次會議係根據本月十八日第七次國務會缺所通過之本年度田賦繼續徵借實物案、行政院根據此原則擬具三十六年度田賦徵實與徵借實施辦法，望與會諸君多多發揮意見，切實硏討，以完成本次會議使命，十時正蔣主席臨會致訓，歷半小時離會，旋舉行第一次大會，由張院長宣讀行政院擬具之卅六年度征實征借實施辦法，十一時廿分散會。下午四時舉行第二次大會，張院長主席，由各單位對征實征借提出意見，至七時散會。廿八晶爲分省討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七晶電〕張院長在糧食會議第一次大會中官讀有關徵糧提示要點，共分九項，對當前糧政指示綦詳：</p>
<p>第一項爲續辦徵借之必要，指出政府原決定本年起停辦征借，嗣以共匪拒絕和談，發動叛亂，政府不得不實施總動員，從事戡亂，軍事行動一時難於停止，軍糧需要自難减少。本年政府徵糧所得不敷，始決定續辦征借，此爲政府不得已之措施。</p>
<p>第二項，征實標準及數額，仍照糧部前與各省洽定原案辦理。</p>
<p>第三項，徵實徵幣地區應即劃定，現趁各省主席，議長或其代表及田糧主管人員來京之時，應即由糧部按中央與地方需要實物數量，斟酌各縣糧產及交適情形，會同劃定徵實征幣地區，以利實施。其需糧較多地區，自仍應儘量征實及征借，以資供應。</p>
<p>第四項，徵額，借額務必依征足，本年征實征收數與上年相同或較上年减低，徵借以一借一為準。就一部地區而言，較上年不免略增，但總數仍未盡符需要，望各組主辦機關，嚴加督訪，，上緊辦理，尤盼省縣民意機關協力宣導，多方協助，不　限期　數征足。</p>
<p>第五項，收講省縣級週日糧應隨收隨撥，本年中央收購糧數額，業經糧部分別洽定收週日，給價辦法亦頗公允，深望地方先將中央應收購之賦糧運至交通便利易於集中之區，隨收隨發，儘先撥足，在米撥足前所有征得賦糧，不得挪移動用，</p>
<p>第六項，折征法幣價款，應隨收隨即解庫，嚴禁提存，以杜流幣。其有擅自挪用　，尤應從重懲處。</p>
<p>第七項，民意機關協助進行戡工作與對外抗戰重要，民意機關務必盡力宣達政府政策。俾人民了解共體時艱，一致奮起，踴躍輸將。</p>
<p>第八項，普遍成立征借監察機關，祛除幣端。征收實物，淹幣難免，各級征借實物監察委會，必須普遍設立，加強組織，以收幣絕風清之效。</p>
<p>第九項，改善征收辦法，努力督征。本年征實之外，仍照舊徵借及事征公糧，人民負担不可</p>
<p>謂不重，經辦機關務委於急公愛國之中，仍兼體卹人民之意，明法定法，熟心服務，征收手續糧成績優劣，將爲考核獎懲之主要項目，至盼一致勞力，以竟全功。</p>
<p>張院長交議辦法　各省糧吏提意見　呈請核示後提大會報告</p>
<p>〔又電〕田糧會議廿七日下午四時起舉行第二次大會，討論張院長提交之「三十六年度田賦征實曁征借糧食實施辦法」，由兪飛鵬主持，各省議長首起發言，對征糧辦法提出意見甚多，僉認目前推行糧政頗多困難。旋經各省主席曁谷省田糧處處長提供具體意見，對該項實施辦法，有所修正。末經兪飛鵬作結論，並稱當報吿張院長，待核示後交卅日大會提出報吿，至晚七時散會。</p>
<p>實施辦法</p>
<p>茲誌實施辦法要點如次：</p>
<p>（甲）關於征收征借者：（一）本年度各省市田賦爲配合動員戡亂需要，仍應以儘量征實及借糧爲主，但院轄市及各省少數交通不便糧產不豐地區，田賦及征借糧食得呈准參照當地開征前最高糧價月份爲準之糧價，折征法幣。其折征標準以在鄰近地區能購得等量實物爲準，其折征法幣地區及折征標準均由糧部核定之。（二）本年應還到期糧食庫券本息，在中央應得征借項下抵還。本年征借糧食不發庫券，不計利息，自民四十一年起，分五年平均抵還。（三）徵借以徵一借一爲準。（四）公糧按徵實額三成爲原則，省縣級經費困難，經民意機關同意，得徵至五成爲度。（五）田賦於開徵後三個月內，如額徵足。（六）不得再以土地爲對象，帶徵或攤派任何稅捐。</p>
<p>（乙）關於劃撥及收購者：（一）徵借糧款全部解歸中央，田賦部份爲中央三成，省二成，縣市五成，院轄市四成，市六成，（二）實物屬於地方部份，由中央收購？統籌撥用。（三）徵借所得糧，儘先撥作軍糧。</p>
<p>（丙）關於機構經費（略）</p>
<p>（丁）關於督徵監督者：（一）各級機關對徵實徵借業務，應全力推動，依限徵足，辦理不力或刁難舞弊者，應依法從嚴懲處。（二）徵借糧食監委會，限期普遍成立</p>
<p>〔本報成都廿七日電〕中央爲加强戡亂，本年徵借糧食，川省配額原則已決定爲一千萬石。</p>
<h3>各省主席　舉行座談</h3>
<p>〔又電〕政府爲配合總動員會，加强剿共軍事而召開田糧會議，商討徵借問題，以謀足食足兵。各省主席爲配合及遵行主席訓示，廿七日下午八時在國際聯歡社舉行談話會，商討各項技術間題，廿八日晚張院長召集各省主席舉行座談會，交換意見。又糧部爲對徵借之技術問題有所硏討，亦定日內召集各省田糧處處長舉行會議，討論決定。</p>
<h3>目前改革幣制　專家認非其時</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕幣制應否於此時即行改革，此間人士看法並不一致，記者廿七日訪另一經濟權威，渠即認幣制改革目前尙非其時，其看法與主張立即改制者頗有不同，渠指出各國在戰時絕少改革幣制者，蓋在動盪時期，多所更張，易滋紛擾，我國當不能冒此風險，再就我國目前準備金而言，若無外力支援，不足應付此事，除非美國能貸我十五億至二十億美金，以其一半從事建設，一半用充改制準備，則此事難見實現。渠認即使目前即行改制，亦僅爲「治痛」性之過渡辦法，「健康」性之永幣制，則須待安定後始能建立。</p>
<h3>中央派吳奇偉氏　任平行轅副主任</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕中央已派吳奇偉爲北平行轅副主任，東日內即行飛平履新。又北平·吳北兩行轅正商討聯防事宜，計劃在北寗綫設一流動性大兵團，俾隨時策應山海關內外突發事件。</p>
<h3>遼省清原等縣　劃歸安東遼北</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿七日電〕行轅令遼省府將所轄淸原，新賓兩縣劃歸安東省，康平，法庫，彰武三縣劃歸遼北省，定八月十日移併。</p>
<h3>吉林普組突擊隊　深入共區展開游擊戰爭　梁華盛導記者參觀白山夏令營</h3>
<p>〔本報長春廿七日電〕梁華盛主席昨引導記者參觀吉林白山夏令營，該營在小白山麓，參加學員爲行政及教育幹部，梁主席組織之突擊隊員亦參加，吉林全省正普鴻組織突擊隊。此種突擊隊將深入共區展開廣泛之游擊戰爭。梁華盛將軍爲最有朝氣之領導者，渠主持之白山夏令營，生氣蓬勃，充滿戰鬥精神，渠矢志領導吉林人民，爲國家民族立大功於白山黑水之間。又長，吉兩地記者十餘人，定廿八日晨乘汽車赴四平訪問，並視察中長路破壞情形。</p>
<h3>調查工作告一段落　魏德邁今返道都　旬內將再來滬繼續考察</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕魏特使等一行定今晨九時搭機返京。調查團認爲在上海之工作，因時間短促，僅爲一「良好之開始」，故於短期內將派遣團內專家一二人，再度來滬，整理已得之資料。且據接近調查團之人員表示：魏使及其隨員可能於旬日內全體再來上海，作進一步之調查與硏究，然時間尙不能確定。魏特使昨日整日忙碌，因昨爲星期日，故於上午十時驅三星汽車赴江西路大禮拜堂參加祈禱儀式。</p>
<h3>美商會會長　提重要文件</h3>
<p>盼改善通商情形</p>
<p>中午由美總領台維斯設宴招待，席間美商會會長史密斯以重要文件面交魏使，其內容據記者自多方面探詢所知，約有下列數端：（一）國營與民營企業之劃分，雖經中闕政府規定，但未能切實執行，致阻碍外商私營企業之發展。（二）關於進出口之限制方面，往往足以增加中國出口製品之必需原料不能輸入中國，而奢侈品及非必需之消耗品反可輸入。同時，即曾經政府頒布禁止入口之貨物，亦多仍然進口。又關於進口限額制方面，往往歷史悠久之商家，許久不能請得許可證，而新開行家反可優先獲得。（三）中美商約簽訂後，雙方原應依約平等互惠，而事實上對美商頗有歧視。凡此似非公平合理之道，美商方面深表遺憾，故盼在美國給予中國援助之前，上述情形，亟應有所改善云云。午後魏使開始接見中美賓客，黨派人物如民社黨張君勵，靑年黨李璜，曾先後往訪，聞均强調政府需作進一步之改組，並就時事方面，交換意見。府委宋子文及陳光甫，亦往訪晤，談話內容不詳。飛虎將軍陳納德，與魏使在戰時同服務於中國戰區，昨亦抽暇往訪。又昨日中外人士往訪魏使者甚多，因時間關係，大部份不能親自接見，而由團員代爲接待，魏使對此深表歉意，並表示一切意見已由幽員詳細報吿。</p>
<h3>應市長邀宴　與各界晤談</h3>
<p>迄晚十一時始散</p>
<p>晚八時由吳市長招待全體團員在安福路寓邸歡宴，應邀作陪者尙有潘議長，李馥蓀，厲樹雄，顏惠慶及工商界人士，席間歡談甚洽至十一時許始散，據有關人士表示，此乃普通之應酬，並非魏使欲藉此聽取中國工商界意見之謂，故被邀之工商界人士，均爲與美方方有交誼而諳英語者，而非上海我國工商界之代表。</p>
<p>據接近魏使之人士吿記者：「調查團決赴瀋陽，平，津，靑島及台灣考察，約於本週之最後一二日成行、先赴華北東北，再至台省。因時間關係，不可能處處作澈底之調查，在若干地區，當儘量利用他人硏究之結果，歸納分析，加以消化，然後再作獨立之判斷。調查團因尙須赴韓國一行，在華時期僅有一月。其中一個星期，用以作一般性之研究及討論，實際調查時間不過三週而已。在此短促之期間內，爲求工作發揮最高效能，調查團決與各界保持最多之接觸，如有貢獻意見及資料者，不論專家與否、均所歡迎。此類資料經歸納消化後，再予以客觀之判斷與衡量。我人在貴國之調查工作，自注重中國經濟復元之目標，但如欲指出何類情報最為重要，顯有困難，此點可以一實例加以說明，譬如建設一大水閘，此舉在一經清穩定秩序長好之國家內，所需材料所需基本及完工時間，均可加以估計，但在中國目前不穩定之情形下，此事與政治，軍事，經濟均有關係，非復爲一單純之工程問題矣。故調查團所搜集之情報，種類廣泛，而不能指出何種資料爲最重要。</p>
<h3>在滬所得觀感　將有正式聲明</h3>
<p>至於調查團在滬觀感，將有一正式之書面聲明由美國新聞處發表」。</p>
<p>又訊：美前駐蘇大使蒲立德氏定於今晨搭中航班機赴京，外傳與魏德邁將軍同機赴京說不確。</p>
<h3>管制都市金融　督導協助日用品產銷　控制利率並取締投機</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕全國經委會最近所通過之一都市經濟管制方案」，其中最生要者爲「金融管制」，其要點爲。（一）督導銀行運用資金，協助日用必需品之生產遝銷，甲·國家行局之貸放，依照四聯總處規定辦理，應由四聯總處及各該總行局切實監督考核，乙·商業行莊及省市銀行之貸款，由財部按照管理銀行辦法之規定，切實監督考核。（二）緊縮信用，管理匯兌，制止非法票據之行使，甲·國家行局及省市銀行多餘頭寸，應一律存放中央銀行，乙·軍政機關及公營事業面關之調用經費及匯撥公款，應按照軍政機關公款存放辦法，切實執行，丙·銀行承做口岸（其地點由財部定之）之工商匯款，必要時得由中央銀行財部予以管理，丁·嚴防套用國家行局款項，切實執行　據承兌貼現辦法，戊·禁止銀行濫發本票及遠期支票，並對期付本票予以限制，銀行代收票據，非收受入賬不得抵現或支　。（三）限制增設金融機構，甲·國家行局分支機構之增設；應先報經四繼總處核准，乙·省市銀行在其轄境內增設分支機構，應先報經財部之核准，丙。商業行莊在財部指定限制設行地區，不得增公支機構，非限制地區，應依照規定，先呈經財部之核准。（四）利率之控制，甲·中央銀行應依照管理銀行存款利率條例之規定，切實控制銀行存款利率，進而控制市塲利率，必要時得酌量提高利率，吸收清資，乙·國家銀行存款之利率，應依照四聯總處之規定辦理，丙。商行再放款之利率，應依照財部管理銀行辦法之規定辦理。（五）投機買賣之取締，甲、取締黃金外幣及外匯之非法買賣，責成地方政府，加强檢查，獎勵密吿，乙·地方政府對於地下錢莊及任何變相經營金融業務之組織，應予取締，丙·歷督證劵交易所之業務，懲嚴禁塲外交易。（六）加强金融管制及檢查工作。上述辦法，其中一部份與財部最近所公布之「加强金融管制辦法」相同，然其精密則有過之，相信實行後，對金融管制必能收效。</p>
<h3>主席接見美記者　對不正確報道論文問題　盼能共謀解決免礙邦交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕美記者團布碳發等十人，霍華德系與合衆社駐東京特派員各一個及護送軍官二個一行，廿七日上午十時半自滬飛抵南京，午由美軍顧問團長歡宴後，往訪張羣院長，下午四時至五時出席新聞局董顯光局長在國際聯歡社舉行之鷄尾酒會，到在京中外記者百餘人，同時相見，笑語盡歡，五時半由美大使館發言人墨爾璽陪同晋謁蔣主席，七時應司徒大使晚宴，當夜十一時離京返滬。彼等一行，於炎熱之天氣中，在京碌碌終日，每　節目間幾無休息時間，深以爲苦，甚盼在滬能多自由活動之機會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿七日電〕蔣主席廿七日接見美記者團，發表談旖，請共合作解決令人易生誤會之報道與論文問題，略謂：一部份駐華美籍記者，由於不滿中國戰後情况，寫作報告與論文非惟批評國府無能，且使美國興論界誤認中國全體人民並無尊重價値，不應享受美國及其他各國之友誼。此爲中美合作之嚴重障礙，實足損害中國人民之光榮與自尊心，本人深表關切。中國人民永爲美國之友，且感謝貴國之援助，敝國政府歡迎任何建設性之批評，但若趨向極端，以致損害人民之光榮與自尊心、恐將影響兩國友好邦交。主席並就魏德邁特使任務初次發表意見，據稱：本人充分明瞭中美邦交與魏氏奉命赴華意義之重要。共產黨問題，不致妨礙中國在今年耶誕節實施憲法，國府必將履踐戰時諾言，產生立憲政府，保障個人自由。馬帥調停失敗以還，中共悍然繼續推行公開叛亂政策，恢復和談已不可能。余茲向諸位保證、無論該一問題如何複雜與困難，國府不久必能解決。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕美記者團員談：渠等在日印象尙佳，日人外貌均極馴順，佔領軍人員對此頗感滿意。日人生活水準甚低，唯無飢饉之災，麥帥治日之現階段主要目的，在减輕佔領軍政年費三百萬美金之負担，故有准許日人在南極捕鯨及預備開放其貿易之舉，然此非爲無條件或無限制者，麥帥之要圖，在使日人於盟國結束佔管後，得有自力生活之經濟條件，如捕鯨一事，日人漁業設備工具亟待重整補充，非短期即可影響澳洲之利益者。至對外貿易一點，解除武裝並拆去重工業後之日本，三五年之內亦難恢復其戰前帝國主義之作風，而危及他國工商業之發展，彼等甚關心中國輿論對麥帥治日作風之批評，且對彼等行期之匆促引爲憾事。彼等一路走馬看花，旣未能進入各問題地區、亦未能對行經各地之局勢作一深刻瞭解，沿途除接受邀談，謁見要人外，在日未能確辨日人之馴順是否爲僞裝，在華僅於車站中窺知片段之京滬市塲面，故對中國同業之意見，頗爲重視。</p>
<h3>伊克昭盟旱災嚴重　綏省府正謀救濟　迅速籌欵購糧辦理爭賑</h3>
<p>〔本報歸綏廿七日電〕共匪陷三邊後，積極準備進犯伊克昭盟，現伊盟旱成災，綏省府亟圖有效救濟，以期安定伊盟社會。冀其武主席昨召開緊急會，決定成立伊盟旱災救濟委會，迅速籌款購糧，辦理急賑。據伊盟七旂三縣處迭次報吿，伊盟全境蒙漢人民廿六萬餘，已普遍陷入饑饉狀態中，人畜已有餓斃者，並有搶糧情事，用一赤地千里，哀鴻遍野以」形容伊盟現狀，毫無誇張渲染之意，綏省府對此極爲注意，伊盟旱災救濟委會將積極展開工作。</p>
<h3>我無意排擠外商　歡迎友邦投資並予優惠　全經委會某委員語記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕魏德邁赴滬期間，上海傳來消息，謂美商對我貿易政策頗表不滿，將乘魏氏蒞滬時一訴苦衷。記者廿七日訪全國經委會某委員，探詢對此事看法。承談，關於我國對美貿易所特態度，可自基本政策及當前現象兩方面硏究。據渠個人觀察，我對美商絕無歧視情事，對外人投資亦向表歡迎，即有若干難令人完全滿意之事，實亦非絕不能糾正者。就基本政策言，我當局最近所公布或決議之重要文獻中，對外人投資或在華經商非惟不加限制，且多歡迎。「工業建設綱領實施原則」中利用外資一節，對如何利用外資，工礦事業容納外股合營，民營事業加入外股，外人在華投資獨營事業等，咸有詳細規定，並明白規定「外資在華合營事業充分受中國政府之保護」。再就「第一期經濟建設原則」而論，亦規定「中外合資事業其外人投資數額之比例，應不加固定拘束，公司組織除董事長外，其總經理人選亦不限定爲本國人，經政府按照建設總計劃審枚後，國營事業得由主管機關洽向國外借款或洽由國外投資，民營事業亦得自行洽商」。此外，全經委會最近所通過之「經濟改革方案」，其前言亦明白規定「以優惠方式歡迎外國資本與技術人才，以達到工業化目的」。經委會最近開會，討論外人在華投資問題時，在工業政策上，規定各種工業除國防工業及若干獨佔性者外，咸歡迎美商直接投資。財務政策部門，規定外商在我境內營業應課征之捐稅，與本國人民同。美商在華投資工業所得利潤，一部份可匯回，並規定不致頒布足以阻撓獲得利潤之新稅則或特殊規定。觀於上述種種決定，足見我基本政策對外人投資表示歡迎，並予保護、對美商當更不致有歧視情事。</p>
<p>渠繼指出，就現狀論，無庸諱言，確多不能令人滿意處，然有若干事實，似亦有提請友邦人士注意必要：首先應提及者，爲我國目前在非當時期，經濟情勢尤見嚴重，當局正設法使經濟難關得以安渡，若干管制措施，咸爲不得已措施，例如我外匯存底不豐，對外貿易自不能不稍加限制。又如我目前重視者爲如何加强建設，因之，對「非建設性」物資之入口，自不能不加限制。凡此當不能比之爲「閉關政策」。另一應請注意者，爲我國久戰之後，元氣未復，人民購買力大非昔比，若以戰前眼光看目前中國市塲，難免不失望，然中國當前所採若干措施，非全無修正可能，同時，中國得外資協助而工業化後，人民購買力亦自可提高，深盼對此種苦衷，能予了解並予以積極性之援助。</p>

<h3>開步走的山羊　記「市民治」促進會的成立</h3>
<p>— 本報北平特派員張劍梅</p>
<p>（一）生長</p>
<p>「天津文化界創玄的市民治促進會，於七月十九日成立了」。中國市政工程學會爲市民治促進會成立特撰的祝詞說：「學術界有權威的進步開明人士不再沉默了，要以「智慧」與「真理」來推進都市的民主政治，使之發生示範作用，爲全國民治前途樹立一個必成的信念。道是北方的一件大事，也是全國的一件大事」。</p>
<p>這確是北方甚至全國的一件大事，將低卅年來被稱爲中國新文化主要產婆之一的胡適，去年剛剛返國，外國通訊社便紛粉電傳他將要另組新黨，但被胡適否認了，直到一年後的今天，我們才看到在胡適領導下的，一個以過問地方政治做起點的政治團體的誕生，——它便是「市民治」促惟一會。從會的名字上看，它應該是一個純地方性的低調的政洽團體，同各地的地方自治協進會一類團體祗是半斤八兩而己。另方面，若從胡適在目前政治社會的地位和它擬有文化界相當有力的陣容看，就會有不平常之感了。</p>
<p>「市民治」促進會，經過胡這的　導　　　的　助　　核心人物張佛泉，崔　琴，嚴仁穎等數月的籌備，終於七月十九日下午四時在呱呱誕生了。成立會會塲中的一副對子：「以民主方式求民主」，「從城市開始行自治」，說明了他們的主張。濟濟堂百餘人，都是教授，實業家，醫生，靑年會主持人，除了北平市工務局長舞炳訓以會員資格出席外，沒有黨政軍要人參加，也沒有一般民衆團體成立會的官樣文章，列席的祗有八九位中外記者。西南聯大結過一番姻緣的三校校長，胡適，張伯苓，梅貽琦任主席團，北平廣播電台和中電三廠都不貨放過這其有歷史意義的一幕，前者派人前來錄昔，當晚將主席胡適的演說轉播全國；後者派員到塲攝製新開片，全部會程始終在四座大水銀燈的金色光輝下進行。</p>
<p>（二）性質與動機</p>
<p>「我們這個市民治促進會，旣不是一個地方性的政黨，更不是一個全國性的政黨」。大會主席也是道個會領導人的胡適，着夏希長衫，手搖摺扇，　脫輕鬆地解釋這個會的性質。「只是一斑有　業的公民的業餘集會——我們的職業寒償得根，不外連生活也難維持的教　公務員。是毫不值得誇張的　業——我們想不時緊在一起　　地方公益事業　　　　　　，帮　　　　　家對市民治發生與趣，用公平的公開的民主的方式來訓　我午自己做一點促進地方民治的工作」。</p>
<p>「現在憂時候了！」「我們應該團結起來，表示一下我們對政治的意見」。花甲老翁張伯苓早晨特地從天津坐火車趕來參加，像菲洲森林中的大猩猩一樣，這教育的巨人，以沉重的語詞，叙述着在近幾十年來的一個大覺悟：「你不理政治，政治却要來毀你。從前我也是認爲祇要辦好教育就可以救國；但是因爲政治動盪不定，我們辛動辦教育的一點成果，都被動盪的政治毀了。現在大家都有這個覺悟。踴躍的參加這個會，證明現在確是我們該過問政洽的時候了」。這辦了四十九年教育的老人也否認這是一個黨，「我們不是爲的組黨，而是爲全國人民的，與大官和政黨沒有一絲關係」。</p>
<p>「我們要負起山羊的資任，領導民衆」！久大豐業公司總經理，政協會員，天津商會會長的李燭塵，剛從京滬爲北方工商業請願歸來，也被邀講演。當我到過西北，常常看見一羣羣的綿羊，總是由山羊領養前行，今天在座的都由　個的領袖，每個人都可以領導幾十人幾百人甚至千萬人，如果我們贛合起來，每個人偎山羊一樣，初實領導民衆。一定會轉樣社會這　」　　　　　口實　家，　　行　大</p>
<p>李燭　：久大總經理。</p>
<p>朱　　：天津仁立毛織公司的主持人。</p>
<p>陳冰如：天津春光麵粉公司總經理。</p>
<p>朱養卿；東亞毛紡總公司總經理。</p>
<p>常文熙：中國銀行北平分行總經理。</p>
<p>王十文：北方的煤業鉅子，王正廷的弟弟。</p>
<p>楊天受：中國農工銀行　事</p>
<p>陳錫三：東亞毛紡織廠副理</p>
<p>任可毅：永利的　事和老秘書長‘</p>
<p>醫生有三位，一位是北平最著名的大腦系醫師關頌韜，一位是最有名的內科醫生鐘惠　，他正担任醫師公會的會長。卞萬年也是天津名醫。</p>
<p>新聞界有兩位，一位是前燕大新聞系教授，現任天津益世報社長的劉豁軒。另一位是綽號「海怪」馳名體育界，天津世家嚴範蓀的後裔，南開學生，現任大公報津版副理的嚴仁穎。</p>
<p>基督教靑年會的人物，如王子文夫人是北平女靑年會的主持人，實際上有很多人和靑年會都分不開的，譽如東亞毛紡織公司副理的陳錫三，同時也是天　靑年會的負責人。……至於王子文，更不消說了。</p>
<p>政府的正式官員，只有譚炳訓　人　他是　　　糧　家，　時，　　後方的　　，現任北平市工務局長。</p>
<p>「市民治」促進會的促進者，北大政治學教授張佛泉，也對記者說明「市民治」旣不是政黨組織，也不是政治組織，雖然所討論的是政治問題，「我們的工作大部著重於教育的意義」。</p>
<p>（三）理論與工作</p>
<p>「從城市開始自治」，這是市民治促進會的基本主強。他們說，如果認爲中國鄉村人民智識水準太低，人口分佈太散漫，封建勢力太大，一旦舉辦「普選」，實行「自治」，恐怕流弊養生，反而使農村社會開倒車；那麽「普選」「自治」，先從城市辦起是最適宜了。城市交通便利，人口集中，財富集中，教育普及，與論進步而強大，都是實施自洽的優越條件，「雖然城市也有它的缺點，但這是可以用它的優點來克服的。胡適說：「譬如城市人口流動性較大，許多人都把它看成旅館，甚至在北平住了幾輩十的，自己還在名片上印蕭祖籍，不承認自己是北平人，對於北平市的市政也不關心」。接着胡氏說：「我雖是安徽溪人，在北平住久了，也願作一個北平的市民，參與北平的公共事務」。</p>
<p>根據着這些理論，「市民治」會定了幾項相當低　的工作目標：</p>
<p>第一，　　，　　市　生活狀况，市政設施，市民先舉實　情形。</p>
<p>第二，研究：邀請專家共同研究市政問題，盼望研究的結果，能擬出一個「市自治法」或「市憲章」的草案，供全國的討論，此外將研究市教育，市選舉法，市行政組織，以及有關市民治的各種問題與法規。</p>
<p>第三，討論：時常舉辦有關市政及市民權利義務講演會，討論會，討論成熱的結論，提供市議會制爲法令，或建議市府施行。</p>
<p>第四，學習與訓練：希望能盡力鼓勵我們自己和同市的公民充分參加各種選舉。</p>
<p>此外，在簡章第十七條中，還　現有下列一個任務：「促成提高城市代表名額，在中央及省縣各種選舉中之比例」。</p>
<p>（四）組織與陣容</p>
<p>「市民治」總會暫設北平，工作先由平津兩市入手，但是天津方面選沒有打算另成立分會。</p>
<p>這個會有個人會員和團體會員兩種，前者裁至現在還不到百人，但如果引用李燭塵的譬喻說，這些都是山羊，而不是綿羊啊！後者還祗有兩個團體。北平　聯公會，和中瀾市政工程學會北平分會。</p>
<p>爲着明瞭「市民治」的陣容，我們且把山羊羣中的山羊—理監事，政閱一下吧！</p>
<p>的　　　者，尤以獨立之評論時代的　將及張伯苓的南開幹部為其主幹。</p>
<p>胡適：北大校長，</p>
<p>崔醫琴：北大國際關係教授，獨立評論健將。</p>
<p>張佛泉：「市民治」會北平的發言人，也是發起人，第一個把拉斯監介紹到中國的，也是獨立評論的健將，抗戰時一度到過後方，現在北大講政治學概論。</p>
<p>吳景超：獨立評論的健將，後隨翁文　轉入仕途，任經濟部參事，翁離開經濟部後，果重回清華教書。</p>

<p>〔本報靑島廿六日電〕中國警察頃首次破望美軍監守自盜汽車一案，因此而被美憲兵司令部拘押之美官兵達十餘人。根據美憲兵司令部統計，最近被竊之軍用車，包括吉普及卡車在內，竟達二百餘輛。美軍當局以爲國人所竊售，但中國治安當局及熟悉內幕渚深知其中百分之九九為美軍直接盜賣者，多數美軍官將其自用之車輛私售，價格在五百至六百美金間，得款後即報美憲兵司令部，謂該車於某地某時失竊，言之鑿鑿。又如在東海飯店，美哨兵常串同國人及外僑，得賄二百美金之定價後，即可自由將車偷走，哨兵則以謊語欺其長官，謂事失竊。德平路美海軍汽車修理廠，四週雖密佈哨兵，而車輛出入，尤須值班長官檢騐，但仍時吿失竊，乃其長官與士兵共同串竊，得款分肥者。美憲兵司令部對此項車輛被竊之偵查，久無頭緒。日前有即墨人名許立業者，住登州路七十五號，密吿美憲兵偵查組長歐道稱：渠獲悉車輛被竊情形，惟要求給酬五十元，始可明言。中國警察於許某往美軍處騙取五十元時，予以逮捕，經偵訊後，據供，係介紹買賣吉普車者，並供出美軍串竊車輛情形甚詳。渠近經由美港口司令部海軍巴貝爾及某部譯員之手，，交渠售出吉普數輛，每輛五百餘元，至此美方亦獲初步綫索，陸續捕獲美軍人犯。</p>

<h3>社論　中國的折衷辦法</h3>
<p>我國對於美國召開對日和約初步會議的建議，已於昨日正式將覆文送達華府了。其內容要點有三：（一）中國同意參加十一國對日和約初步會議；但希望在未舉行會議之前，中·英·美·蘇先舉行一次非正式的四國外長會議，就對日和約各項問題，澈底交換意見；（二）中國同意對日和約初步會議採取三分之二多數之表決制，但希望些三分之二，必須包括中·英·美·蘇四國在內：（三）中國希望正式對日和會，能在上海舉行·這一個覆文，可以說是美國建議與蘇聯對案的折衷辦怯。假如美蘇雙方對於早日締結對日和約均具有誠意，則接受中國的折衷辦怯，就不難打開目前美蘇兩國爭執不下的僵局了。</p>
<p>美國的建議，是在本月十六日向遠東有關各國政府提出的，主張於八月十九日在華府，召開對日和約初步會義，起草對日和約；任何決議，只要有三分之二多數贊成，就可以成立。美國所以要在遠東委員會的範圍之外召開對日和約初步會議，其唯一的目的，乃在避免蘇聯動動輒在會議中行使否決權，而可籍此加速對日和約的起草工作。因爲美國務卿馬歇爾自莫斯科返國之後，就開始在那裏考慮起草對日和約的方式·同時東京盟軍最高統帥麥克阿瑟元帥，也一再向盟國呼籲，要求加速進行起草對日和約的工作·故美國政府至最近提出這個建議。論理凡是希望對日和約早日締結成功的國家，對於美國的建議，自然不會表示異議的；但是處處與美國站在對立地位的蘇聯，對於美國突然提出的建議，當然不能表示贊同·蘇聯覆文已於廿三日發表，除了拒絕美國的邀請參加對日和約初步會議而外，並提出一個對案：主張先行召開中·英·美·蘇四國外長會議，起草對日和約，然後再將對日和約草案，提交遠束委員會討論：至於外長會議的日期，由美國當局與中·英·蘇三國大使會商決定。蘇聯所以要主張起草對日和約的程序，和起草對義·匈·羅·保·芬五國和約一樣，並堅決要求在遠東委員會的範圍以內進行，其唯一的作用，乃在藉此保留其行使否決權的特權，以增強其對於起草對日和約的重要性。</p>
<p>所以美國的建議與蘇聯的業案，名有其作用，也各有其千秋，很難有妥協的希望：據中央社紐約廿六日電稱，美國政府將不顧蘇聯的拒絕參加對日和的初步會議，而將逕行主持召開對日和的初步會議的事宜。這個報導果眞成爲事實，則美蘇在遠東亦將分道揚鑣了。這種局勢的形成，不論從那一個角度去觀察，終是遠東的不幸，最終結果，徒然有利於戰敗的國家；而首受其害的，就是我們中國。所以中國處於美蘇兩大勢力之間，應盡其媾通兩國的能事，尤其在此美蘇兩國分合的關頭，更有作爲美蘇兩國橋樑的必要。這次我國提出折衷辦法，就包含有這種重大的作用。我們但願美蘇兩國的政治外交家，放大眼光，不斤斤較量本身的利害，而能爲遠東和平的百年大計，多多打算，迅速接受我國所提出的折衷辦法。</p>
<p>在過去，我們不能諱言，中國在美蘇之間，未能像法國一樣充分發揮「橋樑」的作用：同時我們也不能否認的，美國對於我國所提出的珍貴意見，也未能像尊重法國一樣的尊重我們：所以遠東形勢演化到這種地步，遠東有關各國，尤其是中·美·蘇三國，均應反躬自省。遠東的危機日益深化，若不早爲之計，設法消滅於無形，則遠東將來仍不免爲世界的亂源，以視歐洲局勢，尤爲嚴重。故中國對於日本的政策，不論是對日貿易，賠償，以及和約等項問題，均應審慎加以研究，參政會駐會委員會日昨決議，成立對日政策委員會，是一件非常有意義的事：同時我們還希望美蘇各國，對於我們的意見，也能特予以重視。</p>
<h3>全國糧食會議</h3>
<p>全國糧食會議，於一昨揭慕於首都：集各省首長於一堂，決定今後糧食大計，其者義自至深長。蔣主席重視糧政，特於揭幕之際，親臨致訓，勗勉有加，尤令人感奮。我國向以農立國，晚近農村衰落，農事荒廢，卽所產糧食，每有不能自足之虞。茲當此次全國糧食會議召開，願約略陳其所見。</p>
<p>第一，我國耕地面積有日趨減少之勢，因此糧產不足：過去糧食進口遂爲一種主要輸入，我們應該積極增加糧食的生產，擴大耕地的面積，庶幾能够達到糧食自給的境地。第二，現在全國動員戡亂，國家己進入一種戰時體制，糧食關係軍需，尤應供瞧無缺。第三，徵實徵借爲使軍需供應無缺的一種必要手段，但在執行之際，很易引起流弊；各主管人員應該儘量杜絕流弊的發生。據報傳消息，主席在他的訓詞中曾指出各省田賦征收，間有採包辦制者，致有大戶反不出糧，貧農則負担奇重現象，此種現象尤不合理，自應迅予改正，再則全國糧產，應互通有無，庶幾糧食的分配，得以合理。</p>
<p>我們於此又不能不指出的，就是今年各地頗有災難；兩廣的水災，人民所受的損失尤重；對於此等地區，應該酌量臧免其田糧，使人民得以相安，糧食會議各代茨來自各省，對各省人民疾苦，必然知之有素。在此動員期內，糧食爲國家要政，我們應該對國計民生雙方兼顧，然後國用不致匱乏，民間疾苦不致加深。對於此次冒暑來京參加此一會議的代表，他們的賢勞爲國，我們表示敬佩；謹於此順祝代表們旅居的康健和會議的成功。</p>

<h3>美關心印荷戰爭　馬卿考慮及時採取行動　印尼籲請澳洲出面調處</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕據消息靈通方面卄七日稱：國務卿馬歇爾本人對於印尼局勢極爲關心，以便決定美國能否採取行動，使印荷衝突停止。馬歇爾現正受海外及國內有勢力之人之壓力，其中包括此間之若干官員在內，擬採取某種步驟，如出而担任仲裁，或提議將此事交由聯合國辦理。</p>
<p>據權成方面稱，此項努力本身，不足使馬歇爾動心，但亞洲之政治局勢，甚至歐洲復興計劃命運，在某種程度上，皆與此種決定有關。因此渠等感覺美國採取行動之可能性，現已大爲增加。此間多數官員極希望對世界闡明，欲以暴行解決政治問題如亞洲所實施者，對於採取此種方法之任何一方，皆無利益可言。據美官員指出，對印印尼採取此種態度，其理由並非僅爲人道及哲學立塲，因渠等亦希望勸吿朝鮮人在其希望獲得究全獨立自主中，不致從事暴行。</p>
<p>印尼局勢影響馬歇爾若干顧問之另一點，爲據渠等意見，在西方世界正在設法表示其解決人類問題之辦法較之蘇聯共產制爲優時，採取暴行實爲一惡例。在他方面，此間政府若干官員力持，印尼長期政治爭端之平日結束，亦有裨於馬歇爾之歐洲復興計劃，緣此事可使印尼恢復稀有原料如橡膠，錫，石油，植物汕，胡椒，及奎寗等恢復輪出也。渠等稱，此等生產品對於歐洲之復興，爲最有價值之貢獻。而足表示荷蘭在馬歇爾計劃中，佔有重要地位。</p>
<p>〔路透社康白拉卄六日電〕印尼共和國駐澳首席外交代表鄒斯曼稱：澳總理齊夫萊業已接獲印尼共和國請其調處之電報，正就整個問題誠意考慮中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿六日電〕權威方面稱：澳洲正在「考慮」請求聯合國干涉印荷戰爭。英官方稱，澳官員曾將此意嚮吿知英外交部，但顯然尚未有具體之決定。澳代表團發言人稱，該國現正與倫敦英官方保持密切接觸，並强調澳洲對印尼戰爭深為關切。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約六日電〕美國印度聯盟主席辛格，今日函聯合國秘書長賴依，請其將印尼問題向安理會提出。渠指出荷蘭之使川武力已屬破壞和平，將爲一切從事獨立舊鬥之人民所不齒。</p>
<h3>印荷兩軍主力接觸</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿七日電〕荷軍戰報今日指示，沿爪哇西部推進之荷蘭軍已與印尼軍主力接觸。荷軍承認若干地點遭遇抵抗，但大部份地點順利推進這。巴達維亞與井里汶間一百五十哩地段已浦清，暗示爪哇東部現已穩入荷軍手中。荷軍並在已佔領區域設立地方維持會。是否自三寶壠南進，向印尼首府日惹進攻，尚待決定。、</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：印尼軍事方面稱，印尼共和軍己克服蘇門答臘最大城市棉蘭，並切斷該處與荷蘭港口俾拉萬間之公路。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿七日電〕荷軍公報今日宣布，佔領爪哇北岸井里汶港迤西五十哩處之蒂格爾小港，荷軍自爪哇東部之拉旺推進十哩，在辛戈沙里救出大批被共和國圈禁之華人。荷軍復佔領溫柯浦灣內之普拉布漢魯吐，及萬隆南二十哩處之拉瑪珍發電廠。荷軍進攻三寶壠區格奴克莎里時，共和國軍曾以婦女爲「擋箭牌」。荷軍公報否認棉蘭已爲印尼軍所得。</p>
<h3>印尼採取焦土政策　僑胞損豁難估計　蔣家棟請印尼制止暴行</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿七日电〕我駐吧城總領事蔣家棟昨晚廣播，向印尼政府及軍隊之負責領袖，呼籲停止對我僑胞生命及財產之殘害。渠稱，印尼軍隊中不負責任分子之暴行，將損害印尼共和國在國際上之聲譽。阻止對第三方面中立人士之屠殺刦掠與焚燒，乃共和國領袖之責任，然後始能不失國際之同情。</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿七日電〕中國駐吧城總領事館現已遣派小組至前綫調査華僑損失情形。總領事蔣家棟近曾巡視荷軍佔領谷地，發現印尼軍撤退時曾縱火焚毀華僑房屋數百幢，據吧城荷報主筆布威爾佔計，爪哇與蘇門答臘華僑總數約共一百萬人，財產損失達數百萬美元，喪生者亦復不少，「一夕之間無家可歸以致流浪行乞者數以千計」。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿六日電〕觀察家刻逐漸懷疑印尼共和國究係與荷軍作戰，抑與手無寸鐵之華僑作戰。戰事漸形展開後日見明顯者，即華僑進退維谷，無所立足。荷軍迄今僅死百人以下，印尼方面死傷尤少，然一般相信戰事結束，死傷最多者當可能爲華僑。即以財產而論，所謂第三友邦人士之華僑損失最重。觀察家及華僑咸認爲荷印政府及印尼共和國，無從禁止雙方兵士從事破璣縱火並搶掠，此即荷軍來臨前，印尼方面所採取之焦土戰術，而荷軍又不能迅速開入印尼軍隊所撤退之地方，以减低華僑之損失。觀察家同時對中國政府對此事項之緘默態度，表示痛心，彼等不斷希望中國政府能對兩方當局尤其印尼共和國，提出揹詞强烈之書面警吿，或予廣播中發出此種警吿。此間人士一致認爲應以此間華僑所遭遇之慘痛經過·訴於全球，至少亦應通知刻在加爾各答負有印尼政府使命之前總理沙利。</p>
<h3>荷方撥款　救濟難民</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿七日電〕荷蘭政府已撥出荷幣一百萬盾，充救濟戰區難民之用。中華總會主席將負責分發此救濟款項。又我總領事亦慷慨捐助荷幣八萬，作爲救濟華僑之用。</p>
<h3>英議員擬請政府　保證不予荷援助</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕頃悉：英工黨議員在下院於本月卅日舉行會議時，將提出若干問題，要求政府提供保證，決不協助荷蘭對印尼作戰。工黨議員德里堡將要求貝文外相，保證英國不以槍械配備供給荷蘭，另一工黨議員員則將要求殖民大臣瓊斯提供保證，英國決不在新加坡予荷蘭以便利。渠並將詢問海軍大臣，英國究於何時將航空母艦「尊嚴」號告與荷蘭，目下是否仍擬予以移交云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕倫敦泰晤士報本日發表一文，評論印度尼西亞之衝突，再度主張以調停方式予以解決。其文略謂，英法二國刻正竭力將亞洲民族主義之激流，導入和平之水道，荷蘭最近在印尼所採取之行動，不免使英法感覺窘迫，印尼共和國之反抗所加諸荷蘭之損害，不論其如何嚴重，但荷蘭採取出人意外之行動，其後果殆將更爲嚴重。目前之軍事行動範圍漸趨擴大，已有二國交戰之勢，若欲避免歐亞二洲之間關係蒙受不可挽救之損失，則此種軍事行動必須予以結束云。</p>

<p>〔路透社新德里六日電〕前印尼共和國總理沙利今日向印度制憲議會致辭，謂爪哇之戰，爲對於全世界尤其是亞洲國家之挑戰，印尼人當繼續以全力奮戰，惟自軍事觀點而論，印尼實己無甚力量，彼等所面臨者爲配備精良之十萬荷軍。</p>

<h3>麥帥發表　佔領報告　日共黨勢力微弱</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿七日電〕麥帥廿七日發表四月份佔領報告，指出日本共黨在衆院內之議席不足百分之四，日本人民在四月份各項選舉中，類皆擁護「中庸路綫」。該報吿並謂，根據日方統計，共黨各州郡長官候選人之票數，佔全數中之百分之一，在普選衆議員時，投票人佔總數之百分之七十以上。據盟軍方面觀察所得，此次選舉時所發生之騷擾，較去年更少，日本各地委員會已向大地主購買第一批農田，俾重新分配於各佃戶，日本各方面之經濟動態已較爲活躍，主要原因在於煤斤分配情形已見改善，但未來之糧食恐慌，仍爲一項嚴重問題。</p>

<h3>美國會休會　明年一月初再開</h3>
<p>國會與政府尚能合作</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國第八十屆議會第一期會議已於今日結束，經其通過之主要立法案，寥寥無幾，許多重大之國際及國內問題，最主要者如馬歇爾計劃，均未獲解決。據議員稱；不論在休會期間彼等是否將被召來京舉行特別會議，以討論歐洲復興計劃，於明年一月初開始第二期會議時，第一件應行討論之事當爲需要浩大支出之一大規模援外計劃。在本期議會內，共和黨雖握有十五年來之第一次多數優勢，然國會與民主黨政府間之衝突，並不如一般預料之嚴重。在外交方面，國務院已迅速提出許多政策，並由國會通過，包括杜魯門主義下之四億元援助希士案，對歐亞戰災國之三億五千尤元救濟案，以及前國務卿貝爾納斯所擬之前軸心附庸國和約。在內政方面，杜魯門與共和國就减低個人所得稅之案之爭，已由總統獲得勝利，减稅案卒被總統所否決。然就限制工會之活動之法案，則總統之否決卒遭兩院所擊敗。國會於昨日休會時，尚有若干杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿所支特之法案，如提高流亡人民入境限額等，尚在委員會階段，預料於明年一月繼續討論時，仍不免困難重重。共和黨議員於整裝返鄉之際，均力言在美國之平民不獲减低所得稅支出以前，不能通過對歐洲之救濟。减低所得稅固共和黨競選時口號之一，故料第二期議會會議於明年復會時，需要浩大支出之對外援助計劃，尚難期順利通過也。</p>
<h3>美國會通過　對外援助經費</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕關於美國以十六萬五千七百萬元援助外國一項法案，昨經國會混合委負會批准之後，本日由參院交還杜魯門總統簽署。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電〕眾議院今日通過政府對外援助計劃所需費用，總計十六億五千七百萬美元，較杜魯門總統要求之額，已减少二億五千六百萬美元，其中包括對希土援助費四億元，對戰災國救濟費三億三千二百萬元，被佔領區軍事行政費及救濟費六億元，國際難民機構等費七千三百三十六萬一千四百美元。</p>
<h3>美參院將組委會　赴歐洲調查</h3>
<p>以便實施馬卿援歐計劃</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕美參院撥款委會本日舉行特別會議、討論是否可能派遣一委會前往歐洲，負責研究關於實施馬歇爾援歐計劃之歐洲需要。共和黨參議負勃里琪斯宣稱：美國參加援歐計劃實爲非常重要之決定云。預料參議會不久即將宣佈設立上述委員會，由勃里琪斯任主席，參院共和黨領袖惠萊亦將爲代表之一。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕美參院頃於本日授權法規委員會，調査歐洲之流亡人羣問題，俾便修改美國現行移民法律。該委員會今將先行討論史特拉頓所提在四年內准許四十萬流亡人羣入境一項草案，及美國依據國際難民機構所將接受之建議，然後擬定一報吿書，提交下屆國會會議討論。</p>
<h3>杜魯門太夫人逝世　總統趕返故鄉中途傳來噩耗</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿六日電〕杜魯門總統之母於廿六日標準時間下午五時三十分，逝於密蘇里州大觀城寓所，亨壽九十四歲。總統其先已自華盛頓專機趕往，半途在機中接無綫電報，始悉榮已與世長辭。太夫人於二月間失足傷股，五月間病勢轉劇。太夫人深得美國人民敬愛，其子繼任總統後，僅於一九四五年五月至白宮一次，平時生性淡泊，並不因其子之顯貴而趨尚奢華·暮年所居僅密蘇里州大觀城之一木屋。太夫人出自名門，爲密蘇里州一竄有農人之女，南北戰爭時，財產全毀。其後與毘鄰一農人結婚，產子即杜魯門。據云：總統自幼年時在一化學肆當學徒時始以迄於今日，需要決斷時常請敎其母，還有實大事件發生，總統必先自白宮以電話知照其母。德日投降之前，太夫人即已知悉。太夫人聞名瑪莎，出生於密蘇里州西港站，兄弟姊妹共九人。太夫人年事雖高，然精神健旺。今年二月十三日失足折股，五月間　疾復發，病勢一度危殆，總統侍奉病榻之側，達十二日之久，卒又呈起色。據太夫人之醫師葛林博士稱；自昨夜起，太夫人即神志昏迷，乃於今最電話通知總統，吿以今夕恐難渡過。總統得訊立即趕返，竟已不及。太夫人於一九四五年五月赴華盛頓時，抵機場見有大批官員外交官及陸華軍將領迎候，深感不安，當場表示「早知如此排塲，余決不來此。」其後果從未再至白宮。太夫人居大觀城時，隨侍在側者爲其女曼　琴小姐。總統自幼侍奉太夫人膝下，至長猶時領教益，故傳記家有稱太夫人爲杜魯門總統一生之領導勢力者。</p>
<p>〔合衆社米蘇里州大觀城廿六日電〕據悉：杜魯門太夫人之喪儀定於廿八日下午三時在其生前所居之木屋內舉行。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電〕衆議院今日通過決議案，對杜魯門太夫人之死表示哀悼，各議員並一體起立靜默誌哀。參議員巴格萊在參院宣佈此一噩耗眸，譽太夫人爲美國歷史上嚴佳人物之一，亦爲典型之母親。太夫人不因其子顯賣而呈驕傲，尤爲難能可貴。</p>
<h3>德境蘇佔區素描</h3>
<p>本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>柏林的蘇聯當局已經準備分化歐洲和德國，使蘇聯拒絕參加馬歇爾計劃更加具體化。史達林的得力人物貝利亞最近已到達柏林，完成一個龐大的蘇聯宣傳機構。同時蘇聯還準備把「鐵幕」拉下來，把德國的蘇聯佔領區和外界隔絕起來，作爲拒絕參加馬歇爾計劃的另一具體表示。蘇聯已經在那裏建立起一個完全由德國共產黨控制的極權政府。茲將美國「新聞週刋」雜誌柏林分社社長唐納爾和特派員霍華德的兩篇報吿粽合節譯於後，藉以窺見蘇聯在德國境內最近動態的一斑。　譯者</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>柏林蘇聯佔領區威森西·派克斯特勞斯十五號是一座莊嚴的棕色石頭建築物，由蘇聯士兵和德國警察畫夜輪流守衛。它是一所「封鎖」的工廠，出入其門的人須受嚴格的搜査。裏面的技術設備，如無綫電傳眞電報機，無綫電，發報機等，整日整夜不停地工作着，用德語，俄語和密碼收發各種新聞。</p>
<p>這座建築物是蘇聯新聞局和塔斯让的總部，前者是蘇聯對德宣傳的總機關，經常供給新聞於蘇聯佔領區和柏林的報紙及電台。此外，德國让會經濟問題研究院的郵遞部分也設在裏面。</p>
<p>世人有以爲蘇聯新聞局是一個介紹世界新聞給德國報紙的機關，殊不知實際上並不如此。蘇聯新聞局以通訊社爲掩護，經常供給「新聞」於蘇聯佔領區內的報紙和電台</p>
<p>蘇聯新聞局在表面上並不屬用德國人，但實際上它却御用着德國社會經濟問題研究院的全部德籍職員約二百人，他們名義上是研究員，實際上却是替蘇聯效勞的情報員。</p>
<p>這兩百個德國人都經過愼重的挑選，都能皈依蘇聯的思想和方法。名義上呌做「主筆」的監督者，他們的報吿須送達莫斯科外交部，對於報告內容的正確性應負全責。「訪員」必須嚴守時刻，他們的報吿必須在每天下午六時交進或以密碼電報發出。在西方國家佔領區裏面的特務份子，把他們的情報由郵局寄至柏林的秘密地址，再由蘇聯新聞局的蘇籍職員經常搜集起來。</p>
<p>這蘇聯的宣傳機構，經數月之籌備，綦礎已逐漸確立，至本年六月初，各項計劃已全部佈置妥當。他們發出許多信，招雇大批青年情報員，最近已開始工作。據該機構的首長馬卡洛夫稱：「此項新措施之目的，爲在德蘇兩國之間建造起一座橋樑。」</p>
<p>的確，這座橋樑有兩種用途：一是把有關德國，西歐和西方聯合國的情報送達莫斯科外交部；二是把有關蘇聯的宣傳灌注到德國去。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>記者（「新聞週刋」雜詰柏林分社社長唐納爾自稱，以下倣此）這次遊歷德國工業區薩克森和土林吉亞的風景區，不禁回想到一九三九年夏間在同一地區的第一次旅行。</p>
<p>這裏所行的虐政和希特勒的虐政所不同的只在這一上：一九三九年夏間，德國民衆大半擁護希特勒的暴虐政府；今日的虐政却由蘇聯佔領當局發動，而由德國共產黨和數千附逆者執行。民衆對之敢怒而不敢言，大家感到這裏的政治空氣太窒息，對此外國的虐政引起反感，重新燃起希特勒時代的國家主義的烈焰。</p>
<p>當載有美國新聞記者的美國汽車開抵德國的某一城市時，激動的羣衆開始集合攏來，不到五分鐘已經集合了二百多人。我們雖有六個蘇聯官員護送·我們不久便被包圍於羣衆中間了。孩子們當然想吃糖果，但成人們異口同聲感慨地說：「美國人不知道什麽時候會重蒞斯士呢？」</p>
<p>即使是最呆笨的德國人也知道這是不可能的事，除非發生第三次世界大戰，這次大戰也許會在已經轟炸過的德國土地上發生。德國西部的居民百分之廿五希望發生這事情，百分之五十認爲大戰是不可避免的。在蘇聯佔領區內，大約百分之九十以上的居民似乎都盼望大戰的爆發。</p>
<p>祇有在這短暫的五分鐘的插曲中間，我們纔能嗅到一些鐵幕後面的民間的政治氣息。此外，無論在吃飯時候，在拜客時候，在東部佔領區的每一段路程中間，我們始終有蘇聯軍官監護着。在德萊斯頓，他們不准我們單獨觀看歌劇，在威瑪爾，連在馬路上閒逛一小時的要求都被拒絕了。</p>
<p>我們訪問過幾位德國顯要人物，都是共產黨員。有一位上了年紀的神學敎授希克曼，是薩克森地方基督敎民主同盟的領袖，對於自由德國青年團的「自由」發了一個疑問，站在旁邊的一個蘇聯軍官立刻向他丟了一個嚴峻的眼色，那老敎授便啞若噤蟬了。</p>
<p>另外有一位蔡司製造廠的董事，他的胆子更大了。當記者問到一九四六年十月廿二日他的廠裏的情形時，他向旁邊的蘇聯軍官瞪了一眼接着回答道：「在半夜裏，不到四小時的通知，佔領當局把我們廠裏的三百位熟練的技師强行攫走，送往蘇聯國境。」</p>
<p>諸如此類的暴行，在蘇聯佔領區鐵幕後面是數見不鮮的。</p>
<p>德境蘇軍佔領區中蘇方在各處招貼之大幅宣傳圖畫。</p>
<h3>英蘇貿易談判擱淺　未能成立廣泛協定　英政府將續向蘇方試探</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕英內閣日內將決定是否值得繼續進行英蘇貿易談判之問題。英國外貿易大臣談判首席代表威爾遜，將於星期一向內閣報吿談判破裂之原因。商務部發言人昨稱：英蘇單就木材供應一點成立協定，殊有可能。蘇聯已允以五萬三千單位之軟性木材及一萬立方　之礦穴支撐用木材供給英國，易取鋸木機械。此一協議已吿成立，惟是否可以單獨成爲協定，則目前尚難斷定。</p>
<p>再據威爾遜氏稱：就貿易事務之談判大致已獲協定性，惟蘇聯復提出財政問題以爲訂立貿易協定之條件，此點尚不能成立協定。威氏此言，殆係指蘇方之要求英國减輕一九四一年財政協定之條件，以爲蘇聯减低小麥索價之條件而言。該財政協定規定由英國以五千五百萬鎊貸給蘇聯。英國已允俟貿易協定訂立後將該放款之利息自二厘减爲一厘半，並放寬淸償期限。據接近政府方面人士稱：英政府將經由外交途徑，繼續探知有無成立協定之可能</p>

<h3>南韓召集　民衆大會</h3>
<p>美蘇代表蒞塲致詞</p>
<p>〔新亞社漢城廿七日電〕南韓民主主義民族戰綫，本日在此間南山公園舉行促成樹立朝鮮臨時政府之民衆大會。美蘇混合委員會之雙方代表均出席參加，並致祝詞。美方首席代表勃朗少將祝詞大意謂：本人代表霍奇中將向大會敬致賀意，目前在此間德壽宮舉行之美蘇混合委員會，諸位均熱誠支援，吾人甚爲感激。混委會必將依據三外長會議協定，不違背諸位之斯待，不日當可樹立朝鮮臨時政府。」蘇方首席代表致詞，大意謂，「本人代表蘇方全體代表向大會祝賀，混委會開會以來，吾人接到極多禮物，此實表示混委會必能圓滿成功，朝鮮臨時政府自亦可能實現。</p>
<h3>匈與哀歐各國　簽訂商務協定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社布達佩斯廿六日電〕匈牙利今日宣稱：該國業已與蘇聯，保加利及芬闌分別簽訂商務協定，該三商務協定係於匈南商務協定獲致之次一日簽署，匈國報紙稱：該些協定可保證匈牙利三年經濟計劃之全部實施及成功。</p>

<h3>蕭翁避壽</h3>
<p>〔路透社海福特郡聖勞倫斯城艾沃特鄕廿六日電〕不主張慶祝生辰以免記得漸趨衰老之文豪蕭伯納，今日悄然渡過其九十一歲誕辰，一無儀式舉行，與平日無異。上午在家讀書寫作，下午休息，外來祝壽郵件，不如去年之多。據蕭翁管家稱，蕭翁痛惡生日之名辭，決不有所點綴。</p>
<h3>會商德煤斤增產問題　英美將舉行會議　地點為華盛頓日期在本週內</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕「星期泰晤士報」外交記者稱：妨碍英美就魯爾煤產談判之困難業己克服，英專家一行，由英駐德政治顧問斯特朗率領，可望於週內啓程赴美京，與美專家討論魯爾礦區之經營，產量，原料及價格等問題。</p>
<p>英國其先反對美國之建議，具有兩點：（一）談判之範圍猶欠廣泛；（二）未經法國參加成立之解決辦法將妨碍法國之地位。就第一點言，美國已允接受英國一部份意見，故英國佔領區之若干特種問題，如美元外匯之桔竭等，屆時亦可望有討論之機會。關於前述第二點，美國已同意對法國之地位給予特別考慮，俟會談結束接，當徴求法國之意見。目前雖不擬舉行三强會議，然會談經過當隨時知照法國。該報外交記者並曰；苟法國願使法軍佔領區參加英美合併區協定，則目前妨碍合作之困難，均不難迎刃而解，三强巨頭會議，亦更有實見之可能</p>
<p>法比兩國　深表關切</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿六日电〕法国国民議會今日舉手表決通過決議案，要求政府發佈宣言，聲明薩爾區併入法國經濟範圍之需要，法國向德要求賠償之權以及魯爾區設立國際政權之迫切需要。表決僅共產黨葉權，餘均一致贊成。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕消息靈通人士頃談稱：比利時駐美大使西爾佛休斯曾吿國務卿馬歇爾曰：因安全關係，訂定德國工業新水準事前先微詢比國政府之意見。</p>
<h3>南保兩巨頭會晤　促進政軍經濟密切聯擊　巴爾幹政局將進入重要新階段</h3>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒廿七日〕保加利亞總理狄密特洛夫，與南斯拉夫總理狄托元帥，廿七日在貝爾格勒晤談。外交界人士對此次會談極度重視。預料南保關係甚至巴爾幹政局，將從此進入重要之新階段。</p>
<p>據悉，兩總理及其閣員等所舉行之談話性質，當當當與南國最近與羅馬尼亞所舉行者類似，保官方透露此次會談結果，可望與南羅會談相同，即普遍加緊兩國關係，促進經濟文化政治上之合作，俟南與保簽訂和約後，正式締結互助公約。隨狄密特洛夫俱來者，有外長喬奇夫以及國防財政貿易等部長，一行在南都有一星期之勾留，然後再赴南國各地視察。若干人士復信，保軍事代表團上月來南，與南國參謀總長波博維克將軍等之會談，表示兩國當加緊軍事合作，包括軍備之標準化等。</p>
<h3>保加利亞申請　加入聯合國</h3>
<p>〔路透社索菲亞廿六日電〕保加利亞總理狄密特洛夫致函聯合國秘書長賴依，代保國聲請加入聯合國。其中聲言保國決接受聯合國憲章之基本神聖原則，及會員國應盡之各項責任，並附保加利亞共和國在被佔領期間與德抗戰之功績，及戰後建立民主之努力。按保國乃前敵國中聲請加入聯合國者之第五國，前已聲請者有阿爾巴尼亞，義大利，羅馬尼亞及奧國。</p>

<h3>蘇聯海軍節　勗勉增強海軍力</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿六日電〕蘇聯軍政部長布爾加寗將軍，本日蘇聯海軍節發表吿將士書，勗勉海軍努力爲國。略謂、余希望海軍人員遵行蘇聯政府與史達林同志所委定之工作，發展與增強吾國之海軍力量、以期完成大功。</p>
<h3>科學家千人　譴責細菌戰爭　認為非文明國所應採取</h3>
<p>〔路透社哥本哈根廿六日電〕第四屆國際細菌學大會今日一致通過決議案，以最嚴厲之方式譴責細菌戰術。與會世界各國科學家近一千人。擬具該決議案之科學家中，有配尼西林之發明者弗萊明爵士。最近在瑞典京城舉行之國際細胞學會，雖亦通過類似之決議案，然措辭不若此次之嚴峻。決議案有謂：「國際細菌學大會認爲此等野　戰術，絕對非任何文明國家所宜採取，深信全球細菌學家得盡力以防止細菌戰術之研究。」當大會主席丹麥之梅特生敎授宣讀此一決議案時。全塲黨聲雷動。科學家認爲目前彼等所能爲者·僅爲使用道義力量，喚起世界人民認識細菌戰之恐怖，以羣策畫力，早日成立禁止細菌戰之全球性協定。</p>

<h3>金都戲院外深夜大血案　警士市民死傷達十六人　肇事憲兵排長　已遭扣押候究　俞局長親勸學警今晨始散</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日深夜，福煦路同孚路口金都大戲院前，發生一大血案，死傷警士平民等竟有十餘人之多。據悉：當昨夜十時左右，有一市民至金都購票兩張，而有三人擬入內觀電影，查票員出而干涉，致起爭執，乃召崗警六五八八號盧靈衡（係第七期畢業學警）至，令此三觀客再購一票了事。是時忽有駐院之憲兵六七人，出而袒客，盧以此乃警察職務範圍以內之事，與憲兵無干，一面仍勸三客補票，憲兵大恚，遂將盧一頓痛毆，以致受傷，口吐鮮血，盧亟屆街車趕回新成警分局報吿。局中有第七期畢業之學警甚衆，聞訊大爲不平，同時消息傳至各分局，遂有老閘，黃浦等局之七期畢業學警，緊急集合，徒手乘卡東馳往金都。時新成局學警亦已　湧而至，總共人數約有百餘，一部份入院，將院門守住，向行凶之憲兵包團詁責。憲兵方面即從院由致電康等路憲乒隊告急，不移時憲兵乘車大至，亦有百餘人之多，下車後即行佈防，一面入院豐學警全部撤退，學警不從，相持不下，院內樓上憲兵，即從窗口向下開放湯姆生機槍遙擊，佈防之憲兵亦即向警方開搶，共達數十發。一時路上秩序大亂，驚惶叫喊與奔逃之脚聲，雜亂成爲一片。</p>
<p>其時有滿載西瓜之三七五七三號卡車，（查係徐沈記之卡車由馬家橋夾者）自西馳來，學警耶攔住紛紛登車，曯即開行，但卡車前胎已被中彈，不喜前進，當有學警李正光，中彈死於車後馬路中心，另有兩學警中彈死於路中（內一警死於同孚路口）。車內並有十餘歲男女兩孩受傷。此外學警市民等受傷者尙有十餘人，旋即分送各醫院，至今晨一時許，警局接得報吿，知送醫院之學警中，又有四人傷重殞命。</p>

<h3>熱再創紀錄　昨最高九九九　新颱風向上海進襲　二三日內或可凉爽</h3>
<p>中央氣象台悉：昨日溫度，爲華氏九九度九，開本年度酷熱之新紀錄，惟與民國廿三年七月十二日之一〇四度，尙遜一籌，故在個別熱度上言，尙未打破七十三年來之新紀錄。惟七十三年來七月份平均溫度，最高爲九四度八，在平均溫度言，本年七月份，實已打破七十三年之新紀錄矣。昨日溫度再創新紀錄之原因，殆爲熱帶氣流，與太平洋氣團在吾國沿海一帶相接觸之故。預測今日天氣仍係晴曇，溫度恐將與昨日相等。揚子江下游，則可能有局部性雷雨。又據該台報吿：西太平洋已發現新颱風，刻在北緯二〇度，東經二一七度，風向爲西西北，上海將被襲擊。如風向轉爲西西，則上海更將受猛烈之襲擊。故該台預料二三日內上海天氣將轉凉爽。惟本年八月份仍將酷熱。</p>

<h3>蘇浙皖區　敵偽產業　每月標售目標　規定五百萬萬</h3>
<p>敵偽產業淸理處所扣押沒收之各種敵僞產業，均在陸續標售中，政府爲加速處理，增加國庫收入，前會規定出售敵偽產業谷區總額，以每月一千億爲目標，其細數頃亦經核定如下：蘇浙院區每月五百億元，平津區每月二百四十億元，魯靑區每月一百二十億元，武漢區每月五十億元，粵桂閩區每月五十億元，河南區每月十億元。據蘇浙皖區淸理處負責人稱；本區敵僞產業敵產已在標售，各項逆產目前亦在加緊標售中，每月所得，可能溢出五億元。惟敵逆產之產權糾紛甚多，尤以逆產爲最，澈查頗多週折。設政府對各項產權糾紛能有一硬性之規定，處理較易，標售亦可加强，國庫收入，每月亦可增加甚多云。</p>
<h3>對於教育的幾種感想　朱經農昨在建成電台播講</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座建成電台，舉辦第十七次星期日特別廣播，請光華大學校長朱經農（見圖）器講「對於教育的幾種感想」，茲紀錄其演詞大意如下：</p>
<p>我們爲什麼要辦教育？教育的基本精神是什麼？教育的目的是鞏固民主政治的基礎，能不能達到這個目的？對於這個問題，我們現在有檢討的必要了。我惆人對於這個問題有三點感想：</p>
<p>要培養受的精神</p>
<p>（一）我們教育的基礎究竟是建築在「愛」字上還是建築在「恨」字上？教育譬如農夫種田，種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，假如是「愛的教育」，則結果是相親相愛，互助合作；假如是「恨的教育」；則結果是互相鬥爭，自相殘殺。一般人都知道中國很亂，亂的原囚是什麼？就是因爲沒有種下愛人的觀念，有一次我在街上看到一條標語：「我們不要什麼，我們只有眼！眼！恨！」可怕呵，這種自相殘殺的觀念。人類要想生存發展，首先要根除恨的觀念，培養愛的精神，中國的因有道德是「忠孝仁愛信義和平」，愛國家是忠，愛父母是孝。仁愛是愛人愛物，愛朋友必須講信義，愛世界才能得到眞正的和平，所以這八個字的中心就是一個「愛」字，我們辦教育的人必須種植愛的種子，培養愛的精神。</p>
<p>要有守法的精神</p>
<p>（二）一個民主國家是靠什麼把許多意見不同的人維繫在一起？靠的是守法的精神。憲法必須由大家共同遵守始能有效，靑年在學校內就要養成守法的精神，大家守法，才能保障民主政治，不守法，憲法等於廢紙而已。我來舉兩個例，看看人家的守法精神。（一）去年美國煤礦大罷工，因爲全國人民的生活大受影響，所以法院發出一個命令，限於某日停止罷工，否則即以法律制裁，罷工委員會主席服從這個命令，到期就停止罷工，（二）美國前總統羅斯福夫人汽車撞傷了人，法院同樣的傳訊，起訴，取消汽車照會，羅斯福夫人都遵照辦理，絕不利用一己的身份地位來逃避責任。中國所缺乏的就是守法的精神，譬如在考學校的時候不憑學問考試，要託人寫信，說人情；上次看到報上刋載學生大鬧法庭，以致不能開審。這些都是不守法的現象。我們辦教育就要培養靑年守法精神，帮助鞏固民主政治的基礎。</p>
<p>要有政治家風度</p>
<p>（三）應該從教上培養青年具有政治家的風度，不但對於志同道合的人，我尊重他的人格，就是和我意見相左的人，同樣要尊重他的人格。康德說：「君子尊重對方的人格」，這句話是値得我們深思的，我國人的習慣，對於意見相同的人恭維之若聖人，對於意見不同的人，駡他，侮辱他，揭發陰私，造謠中傷，無所不用其極，大家爲了爭取領導權，不惜用各種方法破壞對方的名譽，這是一個可怕的現象，我們要有寬容的精神，能容納各種不同的意見，培養成政治家的風度，才能建立民主政治。以上很拉雜的談了現在教育的三點感想：（一）要培養愛的精神，（二）要有守法的精神，（三）要有政治家的風度。以上三點是否能做得到，要看我們受教育的人能否以身作則，因此我覺得辦教育的人應當具有幾種態度，才能領導靑年。</p>
<p>從事教育的人　應具六種精神</p>
<p>辦教育不是爲求富貴，求名譽，教育是淸苦的事業，辦教育的人必須具有下面六種精神：（一）救世的苦心，教育是艱苦的，要有忍辱負重，不怕犧牲的精神。（二）讀書的習慣，教育是一種生長，你自己天天生長，才能帮助別人生長，因此對於學問要天大求進步，（三）改造的熱忱，辦教育不是保守，對於教育界不滿人意的地方要求積極的改善。（四）感化的能力，辦教育有如慈母之待子女，和靄，寬容，仁愛，以教育下一代靑年。（五）高尙的志趣，孔子說過：「士志於道，而恥惡衣惡食者，未足與議也。」因爲有高尙的志趣，所以對於當前的艱難困苦就不斤斤較量了。（六）强健的體魄，教育是淸苦而繁劇的事業，沒有强他的體魄，不能担當教育的重任。以上六點，是我們辦教育的人應有的精神，以此循循善誘，教育靑年，始克有效。</p>
<p>我們辦教育的人現在來檢討一下，幾十年的教育獲得了什麼結果？人心改變過來沒有？當此民主政治開始建設的時候，我們辦教育的人，應該大家討論一個共同的目標，向前邁進。</p>

<h3>薀藻浜火警</h3>

<h3>勝利後的幸運兒　榮豐廠在擴展中　月產細布五萬疋困難是配棉不夠</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕榮豐紗廠創立於民國二十七年六月，到現在已逾九週歲。在一般紗廠中說起來，還相當年靑。她讀生在敵人的槍刺下，整整掙扎了七年，勝利後終於得到了祖國的扶植，二年內榮豐紗廠大大地擴展了。</p>
<p>最初成立時，她僅有紗錠一萬一千枚，民國廿九年增加到二萬零四百枚，和四百二十台布機。卅二年紡織業受敵人壓迫不能發展，於是另立了一個紙廠。卅三年五月合併了上海紡織印染廠。那時候上海紡織印染廠因遭日軍重大破壞而停頓着，卅四年九月榮　接收過來，大事修理之後，改稱榮豐第二廠開工。那裏有一萬零八百枚紗錠，六百二十台布機，及完備的漂染印花設備。</p>
<p>二廠廠址在築路一一二八二號，佔地四十七畝，目前正在大興土木，建造新廠房，擴充紡棉與　染印花設備。他們還附設一個鐵工廠和　砂廠，專門製造紗錠　紡織機零件，目前已有出品、成績良好，不輸於舶來品。可惜現在邊不龍大量生產。不過他們有一個目標，邊到自己製造紡紗機，織布機，以及一切紡織印染鋼鐵零件，自給自足。榮豐紗廠的總管理處已擬好詳細計劃，按步推進並且已得到了初步成功。</p>
<p>榮豐的發展，確乎說得上「神速」。勝利還僅二年。他們的生產力與歷史悠久的永安紗廠相比，已是五與一之比了。他們的第一廠產廿支金橋紗，粗布，粗斜紋，嗶嘰，卡嘰與附設紙廠所產的包紗紙和有光紙。紗每月約產一千餘件，布約二萬二千疋，紙約十八萬磅。第二廠月產廿支金橋約六百餘件，熊蜂細布約三萬疋。漂染部份日夜開工，可漂染細布八千疋，現在因種種限制不能全部開工，所以一週祗能漂染二千疋。</p>
<p>原料的採購與煤，電動力，為目前最大困難問題。兩廠每月要消耗棉花六千担，政府當局核配有限，存棉逐漸减少。唯一的補救辦法是採購國棉補充。但國棉價格較高，於是產品成本也增高了。</p>
<p>記者去參數第二廠。嶄新白石圍牆和圍牆內一幢幢全新的廠房，一望而知，這是一個生機蓬勃的工廠。地上到處是木料水泥和石灰，泥水匠木匠應和着隆隆機器聲有節奏的工作着。下班了的女工靜靜地從一邊經過，廠長室裏的職員，機器問的工人，並不因有人參觀，鬆懈了他們緊張的工作情緒。</p>
<p>記者從棉花堆棧到棉花攪拌開包，鋼絲車（梳棉機），棉條，粗紗，細紗，漿紗，織布，漂白，染色以及到包裝好了的布疋出遝，走馬看花的參觀了一遍。金德林廠長吿訴我：「我們這裏大家都很融洽，勞資也沒有糾紛，因爲廠方也實在時時顧到工人福利，」他又要我看看他們新建造剛剛完工的工人餐廳，這位廠長微笑着對我說：「比大學裏的餐廳，，還要精美吧？」我笑着點點頭。</p>
<h3>發揚東方藝術髹雕　吳嵩高計劃先展覽　在量製造推銷國外</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國無綫電專家吳嵩高，在美研究無綫電達十九年，迭有新穎發明，蜚聲國外。抗戰前數年，吳氏返國，在滬西中山路設廠製造，成績之佳，較英美優良無綫電有過而無不及。迨抗戰期間，吳氏蟄居滬上，協助政府作秘密工作，供給收發報機多架，並發明通電密碼，在平·滬·渝三地秘設電台，溝通消息，厥厥功甚偉。在此時期內，吳氏爲避免敵僞注意，利川藝術雕刻以掩護無綫電工具，由此啓發興趣，從事冶科學藝術手工於一爐之研究，並發明五色油漆，十年內製成之無綫電藝術品琳琅滿目。</p>
<p>記者昨應邀往吳氏寓所參觀、，其所陳列諸品，均色彩艷麗，圖案精緻，無綫電收音機隱藏於各種形式之雕刻品外套中，例如一長方形大金魚缸下，形似杉木櫃之物，實爲一九燈長短波收音機，一七級寳塔中亦裝有一架收音機，另一地球儀形之圓球，爲六燈收音機之另一形式，雕刻岡案多龍鳳。花烏·仙女·山水及其他古代圖案之精粹，髹以五色油漆，純可稱爲東方藝術之代表，故除無綫電播音之享受外，以其圖案形式而論，實爲最佳之室丙陳設品除無綫電外，尙有屏風·手飾箱·手提包·茶盤等藝術品，以及用數字號碼變化開啓之保險箱門鎖等，亦均巧奪天工，極爲可觀。</p>
<p>吳氏計劃將此種藝術品大量製造以推銷國外，並擬先開一展覽會，渠認爲此種科學機械品之藝術化，足以减少世人爭權利，紛攘爭擾之心思云。</p>

<h3>女人眼淚　鄰人的血　仗義執言遭禍殃　當頭一斧　張松濤有生命之憂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北寳昌路中興星三號，住有三房客海門女子林玉霞，年二十一，曾受中等教育。林男友衆多，每到華燈初上，即出外邀友來家歡敍。二房東應阿玉對此頗爲憎恨，於前日下午二時，向林女警吿，嗣後勿與男友往來，以免深夜喧嘩擾人淸夢。詎女聆言，認爲侮辱，即往同鄕丁其泰處哭訴，要求設法報復。丁竟於是晚料集多人，各持利斧等武器，闖入應阿玉家，恣意搗毁傢具。聲勢洶洶，時有隣居張松濤到來，仗義執言，致觸伊等怒，被丁其泰持斧猛砍張之頭部，頗骨裂碎，深可三寸，血流不止，受創踣地。行兇者見肇巨禍，遂一哄而去。北站警分局據報，派員馳往調查，一面用車將傷者車送濟民醫院救治，性命堪虞。林女出事後逃逸無蹤，並查悉女之男友王耀庭（在中正東路大業報關行任司賑）涉有重大嫌疑，按址將王拘獲，帶局偵訊，紹供出林女匿於永興路慶華里一一一號，終將女續獲。兇手丁其泰在逃，北站警局正在跴緝中。</p>

<h3>一個篤實力行的學府　國立同濟大學</h3>
<p>— 杞居富</p>
<p>同濟大學創始於民國前四年，迄今己有四十年的歷史。四十年中，它有兩大貢獻，一·學術的，使中德文化交流；二·技術的，它救了人—病人（這是醫科學生的一大貢獻）也殺了人—敵人（同濟工科出身的學生多在兵工界服務）。所以，當國民政府奠都南京後，曾有人倡議議將它改爲國防大學。（在戰時，我國五十餘兵工廠中，除一二外，餘皆爲同濟校友所主持，其貢獻之大，可以想見。）</p>
<p>回溯到戰前，若有人到吳淞去，準可以看到有一大片德國式的輝煌建築，疏疏密密掩隱於濃蔭之中，在這些建築中　立着一個高高地烟肉，就是以醫工馳名的國立同濟大學，以及它的附設工廠。然而，不幸得很，正因爲它的貢獻是特殊方面的所以「八一三」戰火剛一燃起，它的名運也就注定了，不到幾天，一座巍巍學宮，竟被敵人的海軍，用密集砲火，給摧毀無遺了。到現在不但原校址片瓦不存，就是想找出原有範圍也頗費工夫。因之，復員後的同濟大學，只得散佈在上海市郊各處。</p>
<p>十六年奉部令　改為國立大學</p>
<p>原來同濟大學是由德人賽隆氏創辦的。當時稱爲同濟德文醫工專門學校。民國六年，因歐戰關係，被法人封閉，國人遂收回自辦，更名同濟醫工專門學校，以別於德人前用名稱，但仍爲私立。迨民國十六年，始奉部令更名爲國立同濟大學，并依大學組織怯，改醫科爲醫學院，工科爲工學院。及後歷年擴充增設，迄今共有醫，工，理，怯，文五院，共十六系二科，另有附設高級職業學校，附設高級護士學校，及附設中學三校，此外又附設兩個醫院，一名同濟大學醫院中美醫院，一名同濟大學附設醫院，及一個實習工廠。其範圍之大，在上海所有專科以上學校中，要算首屈一指</p>
<p>同濟現爲我國唯一介紹日耳曼文化的最高學府，故其第一主要外國語爲德文，不識德文者，考入同濟，必須在新生院（即德文補習班）肄業一年（文怯兩院新生暫兔德補一年），經嚴格考試後，方得升入大學。</p>
<p>同濟現行學制　與各大學不同</p>
<p>同濟的學制與全國各大學大爲不同，茲就同濟學制的設施介紹於讀者：甲，實科院系：</p>
<p>（一）醫學院（未分科）—分前後期，前期二年半，後期二年半，最後一年實習，加上第一年的德文補習，共爲七年畢業。前期結束考試異常嚴格，通常是一位德國老教授主持，他的口試範國很廣，這是一個難關。</p>
<p>（二）工學院—前原也分前後期的，現在則採學年制，各學年課程概由學校派定無必修選修之分。計第一年德文補習，第二年工廠實習（土木，測量二系，暫停實習），以後四年爲正科，共爲六年畢業。（一般大學的工學院都是四年畢業。）</p>
<p>（三）理學院—學年制，第一年德文補習，以後四年爲正科，共爲五年畢業，乙，普通科院系</p>
<p>（四）怯學院—同濟法學院爲國內介紹「大陸怯系」的唯一學府。（按世界怯學系統分爲大陸法系和海洋法系，我國係屬大陸法系。）且係採取去年教育復員會議所擬新制而設立。現僅設四組，即，A司法組，B理論法學組，C國際公怯，D行政法學組，將來擬改組爲系，各組一律採學分制，德文英文并重，四年畢業。</p>
<p>（五）文學院—除外文系之德文組爲五年舉業外，其餘各系概爲四年畢業。亦採學分制。</p>
<p>知識青年從軍　同濟學生獨多</p>
<p>因爲同濟所介紹的是日耳曼文化，它的前身又是一所實科大學，所以同濟傳統的精神便是篤實純樸，埋頭苦幹，不多講話。不過，篤實純樸，決非呆板，埋頭苦幹，決非盲目亂幹，不多講話，也決非有話而不講；反之，只要他們認是正義，公衆利益之所在他們就拼命幹，幹到底，只要他們認定那是反動的，破壞性的如少數人利益的，他們就要開口，直爽的，大聲急呼的講出來。猶憶卅三年冬貴州失利，陪都震撼，蔣主席號召知識靑年從軍，各校固一致響應，然而師生實際參加者，惟同濟獨多。當時同濟大學僅有千餘學生，而從軍者有六百餘人，實爲任何學校所不及。殆後因故各校學生中途返校，而同濟則幾無一人，直到去歲政府頒布退伍令後，同濟同學方才回來。</p>
<p>課餘活動三種　側重學術研究</p>
<p>課餘之暇，同濟同學的活動偏於三方面：（一）是研究的—他們組織有讀書會，各科系學會，及辦理各種壁報和刊物。但是這些「會」，大多是屬於學術研究的，即壁報刊物也少涉及政治（可是他們並非不關心政治）。如全校性「自治一週」，純粹報導校聞；「新同濟半月刊」一半校聞，一半文藝；工學院的「野火」，純文藝；「河畔草」，詩刊；「暴風」，綜合性；法學院的「原人」，法學專刊。「旭光」，側熏法學討論，兼及校聞；「法學會會報」，純粹法學論文；「真報」側重文藝，兼及法學討論；「漸」，剪貼時事報道及論文；……由此可見一般。（二）是藝術的——同濟現有二胡研究社，提琴會，口琴會，合唱團，話劇社，京劇社等，真乃「弦誦一堂」。（三）是體育的——同濟同學，以向對體育頗為重視，故其雖側重實科，而一般同學的體質却相當「結實」，這就是他們平日好運動的結果，也是同濟四十年來學生一貫的作風。因之，復員到上海後，在大學球類賽中，同濟有「黑馬」之稱，後果連獲足，排兩項冠軍，殆非偶然之事。</p>
<h3>京滬女籃球盟主會師　綠隊苦戰克翔隊　四四比卅七上半各十九平手　分數兎起鶻落最後一節決勝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近百度的溽著天氣，終日靜坐者，尚在汗流浹背的叫熱，况龍爭虎鬥似的相持。南京女藍球勁旅翔隊，昨晚八時與本市女籃冠軍綠隊作戰於市體育館，是爲客隊來滬的第二戰，局勢緊張分數互相上下，驚險萬狀，捧塲者近千人，大熟中苦戰，上半時十九分平手，下半時綠隊二十五翔隊十八，結果爲四十四比卅七翔隊雖敗猶榮。</p>
<p>翔隊三前鋒之聯絡功夫極佳，但有時球運欠佳，投籃常在圈上跳躍，綠隊因太緊張，亦微呈失常狀態，天時炎熱，亦不無影饗，後衛綫不如前鋒，雖奔波賣力，依然時露空隙，翔隊劉守光陳斌喜勳等爲全隊主力，綠隊賴劉珍竇黃明媛兩人衝鋒陷陣。詳情如次：</p>
<p>綠隊逞威　僅多一分</p>
<p>贈旗攝影，成了球賽前例行公事，翔隊陳斌，綠隊黃明媛，互相贈旗，裁判劉荷生俞菊廬，客軍以高穎瑛，劉守光，喜勳，陳斌，萬舜祥，譚壁雲出塲，綠隊則以黃明媛，李蘊芝，劉珍竇，吳愛蓮，王維珍，伍美矣臨陣。綠隊開球，劉一珍竇左方遠中，翔隊因對方吳愛蓮之技術犯規，高穎瑛罰中，綠隊黃明媛一擲二罰，即以六比一先聲奪人。客軍高穎瑛投中，滬將伍美矣犯規，劉守光空心球兩只，珍實還報二分，守光復來，綠隊八比七僅領前一分，目見形勢不佳，乃呼暫停。守竟打成各九平手，黃明媛罰球極有把握，擲罰增三分，劉再中，錄隊第一節十二比十一，僅多一分。</p>
<p>翔隊超出　上半平手</p>
<p>第二節京方萬舜祥易高穎瑛，綠隊劉珍實運球投入，翔隊前鋒傳遞得法，但數度探籃，球運太差，陳斌遠中，劉守光在吳愛蓮看守下一個旋轉，初成十五平手，珍賓罰中，陳斌守光各一球，反以十六比十九超出，綠隊第二次暫停，黃明媛劉珍賽先後擲罰，上半時乃成各十九平手，掌聲四起。</p>
<p>綠隊苦戰　超前六分</p>
<p>第三節開始，萬舜祥陳斌頃刻二球，守光罰中，業成廿三比十九（翔隊前領）明媛一球，舜祥再罰中，廿四比廿一，翔隊三前鋒聯絡進攻，陳斌搶入，黃明媛屈筋明，吳愛蓮調出蔡實球，比賽繼續進地，珍寶顯穿楊之技，照相機放光，適逢媛跳起投中，成廿六分平手。珍寶明媛蘊珠相繼命中，第三節綠隊賴苦戰，復以六分領前，為卅二比廿六。</p>
<p>驚險百出　翔險受挫</p>
<p>戰局末節更緊張，黃明媛罰中二空心球，翔隊陳斌活躍，萬舜祥亦中，蘊珠守光互中，卅六比卅四，翔隊落後祗二分。明媛二罰中一，珍害投入卅九比卅四，萬舜祥「畢業」，易以高穎瑛，最後二分鐘內，競爭愈烈，結果四十四比三十七，翔隊受挫。</p>

<h3>本市工協機聯等團體　反對開放對日貿易　昨招待報界陳述應暫緩工放理由</h3>
<p>中國工業協會上海分會，上海市機器工業聯合會等團體，爲申述工業界對開放中日貿易問題之立塲，二十七日下午三時，特假南京路冠生園三樓，舉行記者招待會。出席工業協會代表胡伯翔，田和卿，生產促進會代表毛聖棟，國貨產銷協會代表王性堯，暨各報記者等數十人。</p>
<p>首由主席胡伯翔致開會詞，略謂；「開放中”貿易問題，工業界業已數度請願，均未獲得效果。目下當局且已進行派出赴日經濟考察團，開放期間，迫在眉睫。工業界爲爭取生存起見，今日在此舉行座談會，除表明自身嚴正立塲外，並希新聞界多予協助。」</p>
<p>次由自京請願歸來之田和鄉，起立報吿，略謂：「聞放中日貿易，對我國工業界影嚮之重大，已爲有職之士所共曉，不待贅言。按美國政府允許開放日本對外貿易之原因，（一）爲恢復美國戰前國際貿易地位，（二）爲减輕駐日佔領軍負擔。而在波次坦宣言中，對此亦有規定，惟吾人並非氷遠反對開放對日貿易，祗認爲目下開放尙爲時過早。此次開放對日貿易，係由美國人民之要求，美國乃一生產過剩之國家，自需在商業上向外發展，但我國情形，則截然不同，勝利兩年餘來，民族工業因時局動　，日在苟延殘喘中，開放對日貿易後，其後果更不堪設想。再者，此次所開放者爲私人貿易，將來日貨傾銷之價格，可能較其他進口貨更廉，但其獲利將爲少數神通廣大之私人，工業界直接受害外，對國家亦並無補助。</p>
<p>民族工業必受影響</p>
<p>據統計：自本年八月十五日至年底止，”本可能輸入中國之貨物，爲九千九百餘萬美元，中國可能輸往日本者，约四千四百餘萬美元”兩抵須入超五千餘萬美元。又據另一統計，盟軍駐日總部，已核准日本可以輸出之貨物，共五十餘種，包括五類：（一）織物類，如蔴布·人造絲·細紗·毛織品等。（二）日用品類，紙銀·紐扣等。（三）手工業類，如珊瑚·象牙·雕刻等。（四）化學品類，如鹽酸·瀝靑等。（五）電工器類，如照相機·望遠鏡等。又盟軍總部已核准日本進口者共二十八種，（一）農產品，植物類，如穀類木材等。動物類，如象牙等。（二）礦物類，如礬土·石墨·石膏·雲母等。（三）工業原料類，如生鐵·石英·糖鹽·膠漆·澱粉·洞油·牛汕·顏料之中間產物。</p>
<p>根據以上兩項統計，吾人可以窺見對日貿易開放後，對我民族工業之影嚮，吾人目下所要求者，並非永遠禁止開放對日貿易。但希望；（一）當局暫緩辦理擇一適當時機開放。（二）如政府認爲開放對日貿易，勢在必行，則希望能擴充範圍，統籌辦理。由中信局以物物交換原則進行之，勿使該項貿易權由少許特殊份子操縱，使官僚資本獲利。（三）希望立即停派赴日經濟考察團，因目下所決定之商務代表，僅六十四人，不能代表全國工商業。（四）中日貿易將來總有一日需要恢復正常狀態，吾人希望政府能會同全國工商界組織一對日貿易研究委員會，研究各項技術問題。目前英美各國，均高唱自由貿易，但言自由貿易，必須工業發展至相當階段，以中國目下情形而言，爲保護民族工業，尙須予以相當限制，逐步推進。</p>
<p>出席代表發表意見</p>
<p>繼由機聯會代表程守中發表意見，希望政府積極培養民族工業，以爲完成建國大業之義本工作。機聯會另一代表張子廉表示；「要求政府停派赴日經濟考察團，以有國際影響，事實上恐難辦到，故目下祗能要求减少代表名額。至於開放對日貿易事，以中國工業界目下之環境言，至早須待五年以後，如目下即行開放，不但有弊無利，其後果更不堪設想。」</p>
<p>國貨產銷協會代表王性堯，則認爲「政府如能適當保護民族工業，對將來日貨之傾銷，亦可予重大打擊，惟工業界本身亦需振作，以提出自救辦法。」</p>
<p>生產促進會代表毛聖棟，及棉織業代表潘士浩，相繼發表意見，毛氏認爲中國工業界應正視當前問題之嚴重性，縝密研討自救辦法。潘氏則特別提出請求政府改善國際貿易方針，及促使國民注意服用國貨之重要，認爲此兩點不能辦到，民族工業殊難有發展生長之希望。</p>
<p>此後張孟昭代表民營紡織業，報吿日本紡織生產最近情形。及開放貿易後對中國紡織界之影響。胡西園則就機聯會立塲，希望在座諸人，提供具體意見。俾便建議經濟部陳部長，以期改善切身問題，至五時半而散。</p>
<p>農部規定　種價格</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕據農林部估計，本年秋用電種，蘇浙兩省約有六十萬張，下月中句可出庫浸酸孵育。所有該項蠶種價格，茲悉巳由蠶絲產銷協導委會規定，計（一）新品種蠶種每張三萬五千元，配售農民時實收二萬五千元。（二）舊品種蠶種每張二萬五千元，配售農民時實收一萬八千元。（三）上項規定，如遇物價劇烈變動時，得酌情予以　　。　　有配售與規定價格之產額，由各省政府就蠶期所收之改進費內貼補之。又今秋蘇浙滇等省各蠶種塲可製種五十五萬張，每張需貸款一萬五千元，計八十二億五千萬元，由蠶絲產銷協導委會商請四聯總處及中農行貸放中。</p>

<h3>華北特產猪鬃　出口數量銳减</h3>
<p>〔中央社火津二十七日電〕華北出口貨物中猪鬃佔主要地位，而以東北九省所產者屬上乘，因北地天寒，雜糧豐足，飼料較佳，鬃毛長而挺，且富彈性。按諸民間習俗，宰猪恒在歲尾，故每年十月以後至翌年六月間，爲大量出貨時期。戰前歐美各國，無不於此時委託天津洋商，代爲採購，三月以後至六月間，爲集貨時期，將猪鬃由產地運集天津潘陽兩地，分裝成五十公斤木箱，隨輪出國。</p>
<p>交易程序，有在瀋交貨，經大連出口者，舊稱：「大交」，有在津交貨出口者稱：「津交」，如今大連未能順利接收，貨物乃一律集中大津。民國二十六年以前，每年外銷額總在五萬箱左右，尙有剩餘，可供國內廠商自用。抗戰初期，航路未斷時，歐美各國競爭購，交易極旺，惟因產地相繼淪陷，農村不靖，產量頓减。殆日美宣戰，出口中斷，產品遂悉遭日人統購統銷。勝利後，共軍介亂各地，烽烟燎　、學災繼之，鄕民不顧不暇，乃無餘力飼養家畜，猪鬃產量，因以說减，幾已不及戲前百分之卅。</p>
<p>根據天津商品檢騐局，年來猪鬃出口數量統計，约當戰前出口數量五分之三，其中一部份當係戰時存貨，若長此以往，新貨不繼，則僅供國內需要，或尙不足，更無論國外。而北美等先進國家，已有代用品之發明，我國猪鬃輸出前途，殊爲可慮。</p>
<p>三十六年元月份至六月份，猪鬃出口量如下下三十五年十月份，共三二一三一箱，價値三二六六·六五三·七〇四元，進出於美·英·瑞士·瑞典·澳洲。十一月二五八〇箱，價値二八三一·三六八·七〇五元，美·英·澳洲·瑞典·香港。十二月份二三九二箱，價値五★七八一·一入五·六四四元，美·英·澳·比。三十六年六月份，共二千餘箱，價値一·四四九·九一八·八二九元。二月份八六四箱，價値一·五七八·三六九·七二九元，美·英·比·澳·法。三月份二〇六五箱，價値九·九〇二·三九一·一〇八元，美·英·澳·瑞士·比·瑞典。四月份四六四四箱，價值二一·二九〇·六一七·一一〇元，美·英，澳·瑞典·香港·比。五月份二八二〇箱，價値一二·一一九·八三八·三八九元，美·英·澳·比·荷。六月份二八六五箱，價値一三·〇七六·四四二·〇七六元，美·英·澳·法。</p>
<h3>新印花稅率　下月一日起施行</h3>
<p>銀行公會規定四點函同業辦理</p>
<p>修正印花稅法，業經國府於本年六月六日公佈施行，稅局方面已通吿八月一日起，須嚴格依新稅率表施行。本市銀行公會因稅率表各類目所列舉之注釋，頗多疑點，由銀行學會提議，並經會議決定，呈請財部核示，通函同業注意劃一辦理下列四點：</p>
<p>（一）受外埠聯行委託囑向某處收取客款時，所出給該客戶之收據，不按第二目銀錢收據例貼花，應按第十一目匯兌單據例，每件貼用印花稅票二萬元。（理由）稅率表第二目注釋欄，但書有金融業聯行間純屬匯兌性託收款項之單據，得適用本表第十一目之規定，貼用印花稅票。</p>
<p>（二）銀行代收學費，其學校收據發出時應照貼印花，但須一律由立據者之學校負担此項印花稅。</p>
<p>（三）銀行收到質押物所出給客戶之單據，應按第十三目寄存單據例，每件貼印花五萬元。</p>
<p>（四）銀行收到各種保證金，所出給客戶之單據，應按第十一目存款收據例，每件貼印花二萬元。（理由）保證金係代客戶暫時保管，日後仍須發還，其性質與存款同。</p>
<h3>高雄港進入新階段　闢爲國際貿易港　政府決撥賠償物資從事建設</h3>
<p>〔中央社高雄廿七日電〕自全國航商會議，一致請闢高雄港爲國際貿易轉；港後，高雄港地位已進入新階段。據此次出席全國航政會議之高雄港務局長林則彬稱。渠提議關該港爲國際商港事，當獲通過，送請交部核議。林氏綱稱：高雄港直接影響我國防經濟，蓋資委會重要工廠多集中高雄，日本曾計劃疏廣高雄港五倍面積，俾容納百艘萬噸輪船。美於戰時，曾計劃於佔領台灣後，擴充高雄港至可停泊八十艘萬噸輪船。吾人今日更感該港必須復興。</p>
<p>林氏又稱，政府決由賠償物資中撥發起重機，疏濬船及各項機械，資助高雄港建設。高雄港寬一五〇〇公尺，長十二公里，港口每年除六至九月爲颱風季節有陣雨外，春冬雨量稀少，實得天時地利之宜。港口萬噸輪船，原可自由停泊，惟港口現較淤漢，渠已向滬濬浦局洽借疏濬船協助疏濬，目前高雄港航運頻繁，已日趨復興。</p>
<h3>東北目前鹽產　僅供本地需用</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春廿七日電〕財部東北　務管理局長倪灝森，日前由錦來長，慰勞遼北及長吉地區備遭共匪騷擾之所屬盬務人員，記者今以東北鹽務問題相詢，據稱，敵僞時期，東北共有　塲八處，年產约達三千六百萬担，光復後因遭破壞，並由共匪倡亂，現經國軍收復者，僅有營口及遼西四塲，共五處，年產約一千六七百萬担。</p>
<p>本年度東北產鹽，原擬對外輸出二百萬担，然因種種關係，截至目前止，僅向朝鮮輸　四十萬担，今後欲期大量對外輸出，只待國軍早日收復規模較大之蓋平復縣莊河等鹽塲，否則僅以目前情形言，只可供給東北需用，無力外銷，渠復稱：東北鹽產约佔全國半數，倘能改良增產，前途更無可限量。</p>

<h3>日本寵溺地制度改革</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員傅俊儀</p>
<p>東京十五日航訊</p>
<p>日本土地制度的改革，是日本民主化的基礎，進行土地制度改革的程度如何，即可測知日本民主化所走的道程。因爲日本農村從來是保守勢力的溫床，反動勢力及軍部的中核體。日本的土地制度，具有强度的封建特徵，自明治維新以來，人民毫無接近土地的自由，廣大的土地，多爲大地主，國有地，　產（御料地）所占據，全國土地面積，只有百分之十六，係屬耕地，結果農民生活水準低下，工人也不得不甘受着低廉工資的待遇，因之日本資本主義，國內市塲十分狹小，人民購買力不足，必須以過剩的商品，向外求取市塲，實行傾銷，而造成了帝國主義向外發展的使略行爲。</p>
<p>土地改革從上而下</p>
<p>由於這種土地制度的矛盾，日本在第一次世界大戰時，谷地發生了佃農反抗運動，促成了右傾思想的抬頭，終於勃發了暗殺濱口首相的五·一五事件（一九三〇年五月十五日）及近衛兵嬰。擊首相官邸的二·二二六事件（一九三六年二月廿六日）。日本帝國主義，在此時，本應着手解決土地問題，但藉口人口過剩，將人民反抗的目標，轉移於國外的侵略戰爭，在我國製造了九一八事變，更進而擴大爲太平洋戰爭，終於葬送了日本帝國。</p>
<p>戰敗的結果，要求土地制度之改革，再加以糧食不足，復員還鄕者日衆，要求土地改革之聲日漸抬頭。這種要求，在日本國內雖已逐漸成長，但是力量十分微弱，企圖維持舊有的制度，蟠踞各地從事妨礙的舊勢力，仍十分雄厚，如無外力的壓迫，土地的改革，必難見諸實行，故麥帥一再指令日本政府從速實行改革土地制度。即所謂從上而下的改革</p>
<p>麥帥指令實行改革</p>
<p>麥帥總部曾於一九四五年十一月十二日，繼指令解散財閥之後，令日本政府應行廢止將農民及其家族陷於奴隷狀態之現行農地制度。當時幣原內閣於一九四五年十一月第八十九屆日本議會中，提出「改正農地調整法」，於一九四六年二月公佈實施，此稱之爲「第一次農地制度改革」一。惟麥帥總部對於該項改革仍表不滿，特於一九四五年十十二月九日對日本政府致送「關於農地改革備忘錄」一件，指出應行改進之點，並令日本政府於三月十五日前，提出新改革案。繼於一九四六年五月廿九日第六次對日理事會中，提出討論日本政府之新計劃案，並由英國代表提出「關於農地制度改革試案」一件。會中認日本政府之第一次農地制度改革與指令之目的完全不合，並勸告應行修正之點。日本政府再根據此種勸吿，起草法案，向第九十屆議會提出「農地調整再度改正案」及「自耕農創設維持特別措置法」等，即第二次農地制度的改革。關於第二次改革進行的狀况，在量近第三十五次（六月廿五日）對日理事會中各國代表間起了一塲爭論，認爲土地改革進行的程度尚有欠圓滑之處，我們且看美方的答辯如何？</p>
<p>改革目標廢止佃農</p>
<p>據麥帥總司令部天然資源局農業課經濟班長巴德在會中之報吿，他說：（一）日本政府農地改革計劃的目標，是根據盟軍一般占領目的的民主路綫，剷除榨取的佃農制度。這種計劃的法律根據是（一）「自耕農創設特別措置法」，（二）「改正農地調整法，其主要目的在1收買大部分地主所有的耕地；2再將所收買的耕地轉賣於從事耕作的佃農；（二）此計劃擬收買耕地約五百英畝，此種耕地，均係以無數小耕地之形式，分散於五百五十萬農家手中，日本政府刻正從事收買之中，擬將所收買之土地，再行劃分爲適合於農業經營的經濟單位，轉讓於各個佃農。轉讓工作將於一几四八年十二月三十一日完學。（三）基本的農地改革法，曾於一九四六年十月十一日經日本議會通過，於十月廿日公佈。根據該項法規，所有農地或耕作之農地在一反（〇·二四五英畝）以上之農家，其在廿歲以上之直系家族，應分爲地主，自耕農三種，舉辦登記，應於一九四六年十一月三十日完畢。並應組織市町村農地委員地，以民主選眾組成之。該項選舉，應于一九四六年十二月開始三十一日　　。市町村農地委員會之組織，應由佃農代表五人，地主代表三人，自耕農二人構成之。都道府縣農地委員會之委員由各市町村農地委員會中互選之，應于一九四七年二月廿五日完畢。中央農地委員會則應于一九四七年三月廿六日由內閣任命之。（四）市町村農地委員會，負推進農地改革之責，政府應極力避免千涉。市町村農地委員會應擬定各市町村農地收買計劃，審査農地購入者之資格，都通府縣農地委員會，則爲地主及自耕農發生不滿，前往上訴之機關，在中央農地委員會所決定之一般方針及目標內，決定道府縣之方針。此等農地委員會的構成，性格及活動，都有一定法律的規定。（五）日本農林省的一般機能，是在使農民遵守農地改革法，保護公衆的利益，農林省內之農地部，是直接負責執行改革農地計劃的機關。各地設有六個農地部，負責舉辦選舉人登記，管理農地委員會選舉並設立收買及讓渡農地機關等。」</p>
<p>改革中心分爲兩點</p>
<p>農地制度改革案之重要點，可分爲二，第一點是在收買地主所佃出之耕地，以創立自耕農。第一及農地調整法改正案中，規定地主保有的而積爲五町步（一町步爲二·四五英畝）應收買的面積，僅九十五萬町步。第二次改革草案則規定不耕地主所有之土地面積爲一町步，自耕地主爲三町步應收買之耕地面積約二百萬町步（約五百英畝），達全部佃農耕地面積百分之八十。第二點，是佃租。由物納爲金納。現行之實物佃租契約，應以糙米每石（日石爲四·九六二九蒲式耳）七十五日圓爲標準，換算爲金納。第一及改革案規定由農業會担任收買土地及再分配工作，第二及農地改革法則改爲山國家自行處理，完成期限，由五年短縮爲兩年。</p>
<p>解放佃農剷除封建</p>
<p>據日本進步經濟學者東京帝大敎授大內兵衛之意見，此次改革案最大的意義，是在將佃租由物納改爲金納。因爲物納佃租奪去了農民半數以上的收入，使日本農民永遠沈淪於悲慘的地位，從手中奪去了改良經營的資金，而變爲了低工資的洲泉，使農民不得不依靠副業收入，以維持生活。這稱法案，使日本農村裏的基本社會關係發生了一大變革，自不待言，蓋因佃農取得了作爲一個農業經營者較爲于有利較爲自由的地位。在這種意意義上講就對於地主的關係而言，也大大地獲得了解放，從農村裏剷除了封建的色彩確是一件進步的立法。</p>
<p>改革狀況領先遲緩</p>
<p>現在土地改革進行的狀况如何？日本政府本預定本年一二月底收買農地五十萬町步，但實際收買的土地，僅有十五萬八千町步，達預定計劃百分之三一，六，其中固有因在於法律執行時所發生之技術上的困難。實則農村中，代表保守勢力地主的力量，仍舊根深蒂固，從中阻礙。所收買之十五萬八千町步耕地，多屬不在鄕間地主所有之土地。此後於第二期（自七月二日起）收買在村地主所有土地時，益將遭遇困難，自在意料之中。地主對於農地改革工作，陽奉陰違之事貿，在日本新聞報導中，廣有所聞，不僅自佃農手中，强行奪回佃出之耕地，或締結密秘租契，收買法外高額佃租，直接以暴力威脅佃農之事，亦有所聞。地主階級所希望者，是自佃農手中，收回土地自耕，或名義上採取自耕的方式，實則密秘佃與他人，獲得高額佃租，俾得保存地主的經營形態。據日本全國農業會之調査，地主强欲自佃農手中收回耕地，妨礙土地改革之町村，幾佔全國百分之五〇·八。最近地主攻勢益猛，例如茨城縣眞壁郡之地主，組織暴力團，狙擊佃農。至於佃農方面又希望如何？據全國農業會調査五百六十三個町村結果，希望收買土地者佔百分之七三·五，可知日本農民獲得土地之般，農村中市町村農地委員會之性格，對於農地改革之影響甚大，本應根據規定，實行民主的選舉，但未經投票手續成立者，幾佔百分之四十五。多由農村中，佔有很重要地位的地主，利用農業會及官衙之名推薦之委員所組成。佃農之代表亦多受地主之影響。東京農地事務局管轄下之各市町村農地委員會委員長之階層構成比例，即可窺知地主勢力之大，比例如下：</p>
<p>佃農會長二五％</p>
<p>地主會長三六％</p>
<p>自耕會長三七％</p>
<p>中立會長二％</p>
<p>自耕塊尤其是非農民組合會員之自耕農，多站在地主方面，祖獲地主，根據上表推算，日本全國農地委員會，百分之七十五，可說是都帶有地主的性格，可見寄生性的地主勢力之雄厚。因爲日本農村在傳統上是國內體制中，保守份子，反動勢力及軍部的中核體，農地改革，對於日本就其精神上及規模上而言，可說是一種和平革命的行動，此種計劃，是否完全見諸實現、當視日本農民之自覺及組織力而定。</p>
<p>明年三月完成計劃</p>
<p>日本的農地改革工作，自七月二日己進入第二期，第一期於本年三月底屆滿，所收買之土地，均爲不在鄕間之地主所有。第二期所擬收買之土地，係　在村地主所有未曾耕植之土地，約佔世二萬六千英畝，此等地主所有土地之大部份、均將爲收買的對象，僅許保留土地二·五英畝，即一町步。但荒地甚多之北海道，則許保留十英畝。據日平野農相於二日參議院中答復參議員東浦莊治之質問稱：「日本政府迄本年三月底，曾收買耕地十五萬町步。預定本年七月底收買十六萬町步，十月底爲十八萬町步，十二月底爲三十一萬町步，明年二月底爲十八萬町步，三月底爲廿四萬町步，三月底合計將有一百二十二萬町步之耕地，由政府收買移交於自耕農之手，俟第二及農地制度改革完成後，則將着手第一一及改革。</p>
<p>農村問題尙待解决</p>
<p>經此次改革後，日本農村社會將發生如何變化？據大內兵衛之意見，經此及改革後，日本農村內，並非一切佃農，均將變爲自耕農獲得耕地之農家，其經營規模，亦不致得以擴大。他說：「本案成立後的日本農村，在經營規模上，與從來不致有所差異，仍爲小農農村。一方面有多數的自耕農，另一方面則舊有多數零細經營的佃農。形成一個東洋式的部落。」同時此次改革，對於廣大的國有土地，及　產（御料地），均未曾提及，日本內地土地面積三千八百萬町步中，約有一千九百萬町步，係屬國有，公有，及天皇所有之御料地，佔全國土地面積百分之五十現行收買二百萬町步耕地之計劃，其所佔之比例，實屬微乎其微，眞可說是杯水車薪，無濟於事。其次關於日本農民之租稅負担問題，現在日本農民向政府所繳納之租稅，實屬過重，就所得稅一項而言，日本農民所繳納之農業所得稅，較一般所繳納之勤勞所得稅高出三倍之多，這些仍舊是日本急待解決的農村問題。</p>
<h3>西安名蹟　開元古寺</h3>
<p>寺爲唐代遺蹟，爲本市名勝之一，外觀古樸莊嚴，內部佛像環列，工程精湛，栩栩如生。　本報記者李馳攝於西安</p>
<h3>長安·西安·西京</h3>
<p>— 本報記者張僊洲</p>
<p>西京市廿四日航訊</p>
<p>在西北的高原上，一個擁有六十多萬人口的都市，確是太少了。走過蘭州迪化的人，當再回來的時候，總是對人說：「還是西安好！」</p>
<p>淸代的行政組織中，西安是一個府，西安市區及近郊區長安及咸寗轄，民國初年，廢除府治，設省。至民國三年，又遵照全國各省併設首縣通案，把咸寗與長安二縣合併爲陝西首縣。縣名仍爲長安。縣府在市區西大街。二十三年國府定西安爲陪都，易名西京，設西京市籌備委員會，任張溥泉先生爲委員長，籌備西京院轄市業務。到七七以後，因國家多事，日寇犯境，西安古城遭受了多次轟炸，改院轄市也是使爲地圖上的名詞而已。</p>
<p>籌委會新計劃</p>
<p>勝利以後，陝省先把西安設爲省屬市，名爲「西安」，以示有別於西京。直到今年春天，才被改爲直轄市。有人說長安是代表着從軍政時期到訓政時期，西安則是復員的產物，西京應該象徵着統一與憲政，新市府的成立，正好跟上全國的大選時期。</p>
<p>依據西京籌備委員會的計劃，市區範圍東至灞橋，南迄終南山，北瀕渭河，西達三橋。這麼一劃分，劃去了長安縣屬的大部，記者日前曾爲此謁詢陝西省當局。據稱省府擬簽請政院，裁撤長安縣治，將縣轄地土人口，全移西京市管屬，假如這事成功，西京市的面積約一萬二千八百餘平方公里。</p>
<p>人口境市繁榮</p>
<p>西京的逐漸繁榮，從人口的增加上，可以明顯的看出：民國廿五年，西安僅有一五四五四〇人，廿七年十月竟達二七七，九六五人，據最近的統計則爲六十二萬人左右。現在如果再加上長安的人口，那麽數字應該更大得多。</p>
<p>也許這是中國一般都市的通病，生產水準尚是手工業，而消費程度已經時髭到最新的地步。西安沒有例外，現在只有輕工業，沒有重工業可言。這中間規模較大的是大華申新等紗廠，麵粉則當推永豐泰華諸廠規模較宏。</p>
<p>交通上不靈活</p>
<p>西安是一個沒有大水的都市，同時以交通來設，大體粗看起來，尚稱方便，可是事實上也還是不方便，空中的珊機是少數人的工具，隴海鐵路是客多車少，每天開出開進的任何一列車，大半是擠得滿滿的。就連二等車也令人有「無立錐之地」的感慨。至於物資，更久流暢，市北三百里外的銅川，是煤堆如山，遝不出來，西安煤價則超出礦上原價十倍以上，問問礦上的人吧！一句話：「沒車皮嘛！有啥方子（法）？」</p>
<p>教育界學費貴</p>
<p>敎育方面，西安有三個專科學校，五個省立中學，二十二個私立中學，三個師範，七個職業中學，七十八個公私立小學及國立西北大學。但是公立學校，範圍不大，收容學生有限，私立學校，不但大多設備不佳，而且學費數目驚人，以目前論，中學學費聽說下學期要四十萬元，下面還要再加上一條注解：「多退少補」。事寶上從來只有學生「少補」，而沒有校方「多退」，在物價上漲的今天，一般市民謀生不易，許多人在「望學興嘆」！至於國立岡書館現正在籌備，聽說連館址尚在「籌設」中，省立西京圖書館，新書似乎太少。碑林雖好，遊人不多，門前冷落，遍地鳥糞，看起來未免有點煞風景。</p>
<p>新市政開明化</p>
<p>當西安方改院轄市的時候，有許多就說：「西安的經費成問題，收入不多，比不得滬津平漢，在未來的市政設施上，恐怕是一道難關。王友直市長，是一位胖胖高個的和藹人，他過去作過新聞工作，主持過陝西敎育，對新聞同業向來不錯。每在訪問他時，你可以直趨走謁，不必要三傳四稟，在他就苜任西京市長職剛發表時，記者特去走訪，他只謙虛的說：「現在資料不足，所以正在研究，談不上所謂「大計」。總之以後的施政必需做到開明化？絕無不公開的事……」。他的脾氣，可眞爽快。</p>
<p>從純樸向豪華</p>
<p>西安的風格是一個從純樸蛻變向豪華的過渡期中的都市。這裏街道上女學生的大布灰色的戰時制服和美國的玻璃衣服相互交輝，在西大街的城皇廟，你可以買到彫着龍頭的老式拐杖，白銅水烟袋……。同時在尚仁路東大街一帶你可以看見玻璃皮包，以及含滿着洋味的什物。七月十七日（古六月一日）是南五台（在市南郊八十里）的古會，西京市的各小基居民依然是鼓樂暄天，焚香燒紙，跪在廟中低唸：「大慈大悲——觀世音——菩薩」。這應該和坐在電影院內的小姐們所啍的「夜深深停了針繡！……又是相映成趣。</p>
<p>報紙有十一家，其中夜報只有一家，聽說不久還有幾家要出，但願多得「好」。雜誌現只留下一家文摘性的刋物「書報精華」，已出到三十多期，從未脫期，在整個的西北，這大約是僅有的一枝花朶吧！</p>
<p>百貨店生意好</p>
<p>商界的金店業州過去是天之驕子，紅極一時，但是黃金凍結以來，日益蕭條，聽說現有半數以上，已經停業。倒是百貨店，還算生意好。寄賣所已經開始走「下坡路」不比過去那樣興旺了。一般而言，西京究竟不比上海在消費胃口上差得多。所以有許多貨，常常是上海漲了價西安還不可能大漲，有時西安的貨比上海還便宜。</p>
<p>祝古城更繁榮</p>
<p>夏天的西安是很熱的馬路上雖然因商店時時酒水，但塵土總不少。但是西安的夏天是有着他的情調，黃昏以後的革命公園草地上，你會看見一雙雙對對」的男女青年，或是一對靑年夫婦，領上上他們的孩子「一對半」在慢步蹓躂。頗有些「悠然」的神氣。就連那「無蓮無水」的「蓮湖公園」的「旱湖岸畔」，也照例是客常滿。你要問做什麽？沒有啥看，人不這麼多，用西安話說：「散心呢！」</p>
<p>從長安到西安，再到西京，它是進步的，我想在建國過程中，古城應該會更繁榮，更可愛吧！</p>

<h3>星期論壇　倫理建設之基本觀念</h3>
<p>— 陳寳驊</p>
<p>「倫」字的定義，本爲等類輩序之謂，「倫理」就是人與人間的關係之道理。人對於他所接觸的人以及多數的人羣或整個的人類所發生的觀念，便是倫理觀念。研究這種人與人間的關係之道理以及所由產生的觀念之學問，便是倫理學。</p>
<p>人與人之間的關係，因各人的立塲及本質條件之不同，而亦各有差別。如果以個人爲中心，他可以對其他的人，發生上下前後左右各種不同的關係。如對上的關係爲父母祖先，對下的關係爲子孫，對年長者或學問經騐較我豐富的人，爲在前的關係；對年幼者或學問經騐較我低淺的人，爲在後的關係；對一般無分輩序的如同年同班的人，則爲左右的關係。過去所謂五倫，如君臣父子夫妻兄弟朋友，就是倫理關係的分別的表示。在這種不同的關係中，又可發生錯綜複雜的關係，譬如對方年雖高，但學識較低，或年幼而學識高者。因這稱錯綜複雜的關係，對對方所產生的觀念，亦有重輕深淺的差異。然而從大體來講，「輩份」「年齡」「學識」爲倫理觀念中三個最主要的因素。這其間輕重較量，前後有別，而來判定倫理觀念的出發點與不同點。</p>
<p>一，倫理觀念產生的原因</p>
<p>倫理觀念產生的原因，大別之可分爲三方面。</p>
<p>第一是由於先天的良知。如嬰兒出世以來，必對於最接近的父母或撫育的人，先發出親切愛好的感覺和印象，而「孝」之一字，亦就是最自然的從天性發出來的倫理觀念。其次對年高學優者發生敬佩心，亦是自然產生的觀念。再擴大來講，對於一般人類甚至動物的同情心，亦是由於先天的良知而產生「仁愛」的倫理觀念。這都是從良知出發的。</p>
<p>第二是由於智慧的原因。人在社會羣中生存，漸漸產生共同利害的觀念，知道爲了自己的利益，亦必須爲他人的利益着想，能够不損壞他人的利益，然後可以經常維持自己的利益，一般人的利益都能增加，則自己的利益亦必隨之增加。這種共同利害的觀念，可以說是從人的智慧所產生的。而每個人的責任心，亦就是從這種智慧的啓發，基於共同利害的觀念上的。如「信」「義」「和」「平」四個字，可以說是這種偷觀念的代名詞。</p>
<p>第三是由於人爲說敎的原因。在君權國家及父系社會的制度下，「忠孝」二字成爲天經地義，要每個人切實遵守，並且根據這個最高原則，來制定各種法令，以保特這種社會制度的穩固存在。所謂「天地君親師」是每個人唯一的恩主，供以牌位，每天朝拜，其中以「君」爲中心，天地親師不渦做了陪襯。由於這種說敎法制的原因，使每倘人的倫理觀念，加强深刻而成爲走型了。所以「禮敎」變成統治階級用來壓迫一般平民以維持君權父系的社會制度的工具。其實從學理上來講，「忠孝」二字，由於良知的和智慧的原因，是最純良的倫理觀念。一個人生存於一個國家民族的大羣體之中，對於君主或領袖盡忠，亦是然於共同的利害觀念，同時也就是一種責任心。君主或領袖本是一個大組織體的中心代表，對他盡忠，便是爲了共同的利益。「孝」字當然是最自然的從天性良知發出的倫理觀念，一個人對於生我者的父母，知道自己的身體性命都是父母所賜，那有不油然而起孝順侍奉的心願，中國二十四孝的故事，都是可歌可泣的，表現了最純良最祟高的道德形態。現在君主尃制和宗法社會的制度已經改革了，社會組織向着民主憲政的目標前進，然而「忠孝」二字，還應該是倫理道德的最高標準。</p>
<p>二，倫理觀念的相對性和責任心</p>
<p>倫理關係是相對的，所以倫理觀念也是相對的。中國在三代以前，已經注重這種人與人間的相對的關係。至孔子而愈使倫理關係的相對性的理論發揚光大，蔚然完成了整個一套的倫理哲學。最重要的一點，就是他能够認識。倫理關係的相對性。所謂「君君臣臣父父子子」，要各憑其位，各盡其責，也就是各秉持其正常的倫理觀念。如果君不行其君之道，則臣亦將不守其臣之禮，所謂「君不君，臣不臣，父不父，子不子」；於是天下大亂，社會秩序常然破壞，朱伯　先生講過「倫常乖舛，立見消亡」，就是這個道理。我們要經常維特良好的倫理關係，必須注重相對性的原則，不但自己對於對方要守住應該有的禮貌態度和服務責任，同時要對方也守住他的本位態度和責任。這種努力，是先哲名賢一向所稱道的。而對於所謂愚忠愚孝，則一致批評反對，爲臣子者，能使他的君主父親成爲明君賢父，是最了不起的功力。在這種相對的倫理觀念下，敎人爲善，也就變成了一種責任，同時也是一種功德。這種站在相對性的共同利書的觀點上的說敎，倒是合乎正常的偷理道德的原則的</p>
<p>人與人間的關係，從個人做出發點，雖然是由親而疎，由近而遠，由小而大；但是從整個的人羣體來講，則個人爲「小我」，羣體爲「大我」，「小我」寄托於「大我」之內。「大我」存在的重要性，誠不知高於「小我」若于倍，故「小我」的本自生存意義小，而爲「大我」的生存意義大。這是基於共同利害的觀念所產生的責任心和義務觀。更從個人的良知的出發點來講，則一個人對於其他的人，都能够自然地產生同情心，往往由於同情而爲他人服務，甚至願意犧牲個人，來援救他人以及爭取共同的利益，而保持「大我」的存在。所謂「殺身成仕，捨身取義」，便是這種偷觀念的正當表現。我們不要僅僅注重個人與個人間的倫理關係，而忽視了個人對國家民族社會人羣的倫理責任。所謂「仁」「義」「忠」「勇」等代名詞，其意義實偏重於「小我」對「大我」的責任觀念。</p>
<p>三，倫理關係的維繫與破壞</p>
<p>個人與個人間的倫理關係，如果要維持得很好、有兩個字值得我們遵守。曾子曰：「夫子之道，忠恕而已矣。」這「忠恕」二個字，確是孔子倫理哲學的精粹要義。「忠」是我個人對於他人的忠實誠懇的心意及其所表現的態度，以至發展爲服務觀與責任心。「恕」是對於他人對自己不當的行爲與態度予以原諒，其用意在糾正補救正常的倫理關係，不使其更形惡化而遭破壞。因爲其目的在維持倫常關係，故不取報復的手段，而取原諒的態度。「恕」付字是積極的辦法，不是消極的應付，「恕」的應用，是有限度的。在何種塲合何等程度之下，方可恕，超越此限度則不可恕。古人考慮到對對方不可恕的限度時，始出絕交一策。「忠恕」二個字的目的，都在維持人與人間的倫常關係。</p>
<p>爲了要維持良好的倫常關係，我們還要注重中庸之道。第一要講愛字，愛的出發點當然是好的；但是愛之不得其道，如溺愛、偏愛，寵愛，反使對方動搖了自身的立塲，做出不當的行爲，從而破壞了倫常關係，甚至社會秩序，雖曰愛之，其實害之。所以愛字是不能濫用的。其及講到報德報怨的問題，也是不可過份的。以德報德是當然的，以德報怨，大可不必，而應改爲「以直報怨」，纔爲適中。至於以怨報德，則大不該，一般人對忘恩負義者，莫不痛恨唾葉，也就是因爲反常悖理的原因。第三是過於恭敬而趨於諂媚的態度，也是不可取法的。子曰：「巧言令色，鮮矣仁！」所以今日之專事逢迎者，實喪失了仁德的本性，在倫理道德上都是不許可的。孔子最注重中庸之道，有過與不及，均謂之「不仁」，我們在春秋筆法中，就事論理，可窺見一斑。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們要講到人與人間的關係之反常性與破壞原因。從前孟子主性善，苟子主性惡，儒家與法家的治世政策，亦有歧別，漸近大家討論愛和恨的問題，這都是與倫理哲學有密切的關係，而是基本主要的問題。上面講過，由於人的良知而產生同情心，由於人的智慧產生了共同利害觀念的責任心，這可說明人性是本善的，應該可以經常維持人與人間的良好的倫理關係；然而何以人性會變惡呢？</p>
<p>第一，是慾望的原因。一個人求生的慾望是先天的，但是他開始的目標，是對物，而不是對人，在大自然間，物的供給不發生缺乏或人爲的障碍時，人與人間的正常關係也不致被破壞。是故僅僅求生慾望的先天性能，決不能說是惡的。等到人的慾望，超過求生限度而發展到損人利己以遂私慾的時候，他的個性及智慧方面，已經滲入了後天的社會的原因，但是這種後天的社會的原因，仍可以用人爲的方法和力量糾正過來，不致使個人的慾望任意發展，而妨碍他人的利益，以致破壞倫常關係。</p>
<p>第二，是報復憎恨的原因。人性本來是善的，仁愛的同情心，亦人皆有之，然而由於社會制度的不良，他個人已經受到壓迫，求生發生問題，當然引起他的反感，而發生憎惡怨恨的心理，這當然起於人爲的原因。我們要維持良好的倫理關係，使人性不惡而恢復於善，必定要努力改善社會制度，使法令政策，合乎共同福利平等生存的原則，不致使一部份人攫奪他部份人的利益，剷除奴役剝削的關係，然後消滅矛盾衝奪的現象。所謂「和平」必須先平而後和，這纔奠定了眞正倫理建設的基礎。</p>
<p>四，社會建設與四維的功用</p>
<p>倫理建設，在維持人與人間之正常的良好的關係，並在共同協力合作的原則下，來建設和平進步的文明的社會，增進人類生活的幸福，是故倫理建設，亦即社會建設的基礎。我們講到五項建設，即心理建設，倫理建設，社會建設，政治建建設，經濟建設，其中社會建設實即是五項建設之中心建設，其他四項建設，都是配合社會建設的需要的，苟社會建設有了一個健全良好的圓滿機動的基礎，則人類的幸福當然一天天的提高了；所謂政治建設經濟建設，都應該向着這個中心目標，作出步驟及辦法，一切的努力，都是適應社會建設的；而心理建設和倫理建設，則從個人的人格與道德觀念作起點達成建立人與人問的良好關係以及犧牲「小我」爲「大我」努力服務，亦都是爲了社會建設的需要；尤其倫理建設，更是社會建設的基礎，更有密切的關係。現在我們要講到四維「禮」「義」「廉」「恥」的觀念的論據及其功用。</p>
<p>「禮」是人對人的一種禮貌態度，用來維持社會的秩序的。上面講過，人與人的關係，可從上下前後左右的關係的不同，而產生不同的倫理觀念，從而亦產生了不同的禮貌態度。如父對子，子對父，君對臣，臣對君，夫對妻，妻對夫，師長對子弟，子弟對師長都因關係的不同，而各產生應有的禮貌態度。這個「禮」字，就是用來維特正常的良好的倫理關係，也就是維持正常的良好的社會秩序。除了以個人與個人間禮貌態度作起點外，更從食衣住行生活方面表現出「禮」的意義和功用來。再擴大來講，則從羣衆集會的塲合，定出共同遵守的禮節和規矩，如婚喪喜慶以及各種宴會，都因倫理關係的不同，而定出各種不同的禮節。</p>
<p>「義」是大衆共同的利益。我們擔倡一個「義」字，要使人都爲了公共的利益而努力，所謂急公好義、便是爲社會人羣服務倡導公正與論，舉辦公共事業，造成大衆福利，都是包括在「義」字的意義內。甚至寗願犧牲一己以挽救或博取多數人的利益，所謂「捨身取義」，便是這個道理。這是從共同利害觀念及責任心做出發點的，也就是以「大我」爲目的，這是「四維」中最富有積極性表現的一種德性。</p>
<p>「廉」是奉公守法不貪汚的意思，這是防止個人侵犯公共利益的觀念作用。一個人的慾望，如不加節制，易於侵犯他人利益以至公共的利益。尤其有公職的人，可能利用職權上的便利，來侵蝕公家的利益，同是也就破壞了法紀。我們提倡一個「廉」字，要人人自知操守，尊重自己的人格，不敢生貪贓枉法之心，這是防患於未然的倫理觀念的克己的作用。</p>
<p>「恥」是糾正破壞倫理綱紀的觀念名詞。在個人方面，如果自己發生一個惡念，有破壞倫理綱紀及損害他人的企圖，取者己經做出不道德的行爲，則可用一個「恥」字來取消惡念或停止破壞的行爲，以挽救倫理綱紀的恢復完整，所以「知恥」是個人在社會羣衆中生存所必需的重要條件。從「大我」的觀點出發，則公共的利益，也就是個人的利益，保持倫理綱紀及社會羣衆的福利，也就是個人的責任，如果倫理綱紀及公共權益遭到了他人的破壞，個人也認爲是奇恥大辱，必定要起來將破壞者或侵略者打倒，恢復社會綱紀和公共權益，方算雪恥洗辱，盡了自己的責任。「恥」的意義的發揮，其功用甚大，有積極的挽救性的力的作用，所以其意義與「勇」字相聯，所謂「過則勿憚改，」「知恥近乎勇，」「明恥敎戰」云云，都是「恥」字觀念上的力的作用。</p>
<p>「禮」「義」「廉」「恥」四個字的意義的特點，都在　人自動自發來維持社會秩序，保障公共權益，不管將來社會制度改變至何種程度，但這個中心意義是水久不變的，而且是可以永久適應的。這四個字的功用，是從倫理觀念做出發點，而達到社會建設的目的。（完）</p>

<h3>小夜曲</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>將朦朧的夜割下一塊，塡滿了我房間裏的兩個窗框，作爲玻璃似的淡灰色的窗帘。讓點點的星光從這窗帘中漏進來，讓未曉前的悠悠的風從這窗帘裏吹進來，給我在淸凉裏淴了一個浴。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>一頭白鳥氣喘喘地駝着滿背的斜陽，急急地飛到這海邊來。到達逐漸灰暗的海灘上時，白鳥將身體一抖，陡然拋去了一背的斜陽，舒了一口氣，回頭望一望懸掛在山腰裏的紅太陽，覺得毫不足奇，便在海灘上緩緩地散步起來了。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>六角的竹笠，白布的短衫，靑布的短褲，赤足草履，掮着一枝竹竿，竿端繫着鳥籠，簡上蓋着楊柳的枝葉，籠子裏是「知了，知了，」呌着的蟬羣。兩個靑年農人的賣蟬者，在繁忙的福州路上那麼閒適地前後走着，眞是給了都市一服清凉劑。</p>
<h3>Charming　Lee</h3>
<p>— 秦嶺</p>
<p>美麗與聰明對女子有時候是一種無比的恩物，可是以此作爲資本的話，它將是最最危險的投機。</p>
<p>據說跑進了C大而不認識Charming　Lee，是一種無可彌補的缺憾。</p>
<p>已記不淸第一次看見她在什麽塲合了。但她的那份裝飾，綠色西服，綠色遮陽眼鏡，斜戴一頂闊邊軟草帽，項間一掛白珠鍊，怪漂亮怪伶俐的樣子呌您不得不想：『她的的確確應該呌Chnrming　Lee。』</p>
<p>她的中文名字是「李家明」，但因爲呌起來沒有Charming　Lee爽利動聽，前者反被遺忘了。父親是駐美大使的隨員，家明曾跟父親在美國住了三年，說得一口流利英語；終日在外交人員間交際，又是校長先生的乾女兒，當然，她在C大的身份是與衆不同了。</p>
<p>她是醫科三年級生，比我們高一班，彼此的敎室是緊鄰，每天早晨，第一堂課上了二十分鐘模樣，走廊裏老有急促的高跟鞋聲，男同學們竊竊在說：『Charming　Lee！Charmin　Lee！』果然十趟九趟沒錯兒，她的髮際的綢帶在玻璃窗外幌過去了。我們雖不同級，膳廳裏却常時相見，其實這裏所說的時常只包括了午飯時間，早晚兩餐家明絕不會在膳堂裘出現。即使如此，大家也成了不相識的相識，她總是這樣笑容滿面帶跳帶蹦地跑進飯廳來，老媽子搓着雙手恭順地呌着『李小姐』時，她早在拿着匙子搯湯了。大家對她的評語是：『身爲西宮皇后，架子却並不大。』這恐怕是多數人歡喜她的原因之一吧。</p>
<p>我們的宿舍位在園子中央，牆角有竹林，有灌木叢，黃薔薇點綴了當前一片草地。圍牆外面就是農塲，風過的時候，竹林簌簌瑟瑟地響，樹下那座古井顯得更沉靜似的，農塲裏不時傳來鴿子溫和的鳴聲，環境是幽靜極了。早上沒有課的日子，我們總愛在走廊裏拉上一張躺椅，對着那片園子預備功課。有一次，當我反覆背誦拉丁文而微微有些瞌睡時，背後有了細碎的脚聲，轉頭一看又是家明。她走上石階，以並不陌生的神態招呼我：</p>
<p>「是讀拉丁文麼？」笑得那樣嫣然。</p>
<p>「是的，不坐一會？」我拉過身邊一張椅子，細細打量着她，黑披肩，黑絲較旗袍，四沿綴滿了閃光的小鏡片，又是一色的　皮鞋，全　夜宴會的裝飾。丟下皮包，她坐了下來。</p>
<p>「又是月考，明天的病理學還沒看……」她兩眼透着疲倦的神情咕嚕着。</p>
<p>「昨晚又是通宵！」她的黑纖的　　吿許了我一夜的狂舞。</p>
<p>『可不是……我羡慕您們有安靜讀書心情。」她用手搥着腿，蹙緊了雙眉，像起了皺的花瓣</p>
<p>「您爲什麽不可以這樣作！」我略帶點譏諷的口吻。</p>
<p>『您以爲我喜歡這種生活！」</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>『對於失了舵的船，就操縱不了它的方向……』</p>
<p>我們以靜默結束了談話，是的，以我的性格而言，怕永遠不會懂得家明，當您以一連串波浪的姿態跑入寢室時，我獨自微微笑了。一個人到了如許年齡，還不能生活在自己選擇的習慣裘，未免是一種奇蹟。不是聽見。這麽個故事，家明的筆記，試卷，都由男同學代庖，她自己根本不看書。有人勸她旣然沒時間看書，何不讀商科或文科一類比較輕鬆的學系。她回說：『讀醫科聽起來風光點！」爲了風光而學醫的人，會是不得已而交際而跳終宵舞的？是她自己丟下了舵，是她自己不需要舵嘛！</p>
<p>校慶紀念在C大是一個最愉快的節日，因爲臨近中秋，晚上的情味格外深長。禮堂內鑼鼓喧天上演京劇的時候，我奈不住那種囂雜，拉着鄰座的沁綠君悄悄走了出來；跑進女宿舍的木栅時，兩人同時放緩了脚步。這裏一條白石廣道，繞過祈禱室直通至宿舍前廊；兩旁滿是綠油油的女貞、肥厚的葉片在月光下閃閃發亮；一株株雪松，亭亭華蓋，吐着沉沉的濃翠；夜風帶一點凉意。正默默沿着廣道走着時，對面來了三四個人影，帶說帶笑地，只看淸了前面的一位，是醫三的小白——也是頗爲活動的儂伙，身划船　束。</p>
<p>『玄武湖去不去？』高興得令人羡慕的聲調。</p>
<p>沁綠搖搖頭，挽着我立停了。對她們的背影嘆息着說：</p>
<p>『這羣女孩子，眞是！』經過祈禱室，我拉着沁錄跨上石級，就在門前石欄上坐了下來；正對着冰凉的滿地月色凝　了出來，用手帕掩着臉走過去了。沁綠眼快，輕輕對我說：『Charming　Lee！』</p>
<p>我們悶納她怎麽不去玄武湖，跑進祈禱室一看，聖台前白燭還瑩然滴着臘淚。難道說家明是笙歌徹終宵，斯時獨憔悴麽？她那份並未被帶走的慘淡情味似乎也感染了我們，彼此無言默視，會心嘆息起來。那麽，近日盛傳着的關於家明的誹言並不全屬子虛了。『對於失去了舵的船就操縱不了它的方向」。是的，情感是人生最美同時也是最殘酷的點綴，會運用情感的人將獲得人間至上的幸福，反之就跌入罪惡的深淵了。</p>
<p>在我離開C大的第二年，聽說家明結婚了，對方是大使館秘書的兒子，擁有十分財產，却是個跛子。不過對家明第一次失足說起來，遠不失爲一個穩當的歸宿。婚後他們住在西湖別墅裏，家明本擅披霞娜，那麽對着西湖的淡月麗水可以讓未滿足的缺陷感情找到彌補了。繼而又聽說她添了個孩子，大概總有個類似彼得式約翰的名子吧，但願她的母愛能抹拭去苦痛的陳跡。然而最近又聽人說家明患TB去世了。她裝飾了別人的生活，却讓別人裝飾了她的墳墓，生長在綠葉頂端的花朵，開得最早也謝得最快，這是一定的，不過，家明一生盛衰的轉變未免快得驚人，快得惋惜。</p>

<h3>夏夜的星子</h3>
<p>— 培茵</p>
<p>夏夜</p>
<p>天空裏閃爍着繁星</p>
<p>大地上點燃起千萬粒　火</p>
<p>明暗在無垠的夜之原野裏</p>
<p>是一對鉀秘的形象呵！</p>
<p>潤濕的草地是一張柔軟的床</p>
<p>我躺臥，放恣地伸展開四肢</p>
<p>讓微風吻着我底單衣</p>
<p>聽遠處浮動的蛙鼓</p>
<p>看滿天的繁星</p>
<p>鑲嵌在湛深的藍天裏……</p>
<p>殞落的星子</p>
<p>拖一條黃色的長尾</p>
<p>橫過半個天空</p>
<p>我記憶起那古老的傳說：——</p>
<p>當一顆星子殞落時</p>
<p>有一個靈魂走進天堂——</p>
<p>於是我關懷着死者的一家</p>
<p>也神往於那逝去的星子——</p>
<p>究竟飄落在何方，</p>
<p>夜風在原野裏遊蕩</p>
<p>播送着　然的稻葉底氣息</p>
<p>我童識到靜雙的，難言的寂寫</p>
<p>深切的懷念底潮汐澎湃在我底心裏</p>
<p>許多次，我選定那最明亮的星子</p>
<p>表　一個高貴而善良的靈魂</p>
<p>這消釋了我無數次的寂寫</p>
<p>在靜靜的多星之夜裏</p>
<p>一個辛勞的夜行者</p>
<p>踏着微弱的星光</p>
<p>從迢遙的遠方來了</p>
<p>星子們是有一顆善良的心的</p>
<p>他點亮了旅人們的希望……</p>
<p>拖一身沉重的記憶</p>
<p>踏着圓石的小徑</p>
<p>向着自己的小舍</p>
<p>我蹀蹼在靜寂的七月之夜裏……</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　360</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「過去的事，我想回頭再談，眼面前我想我們先交換一點消息，你看？……」我知道耀羣急於要知道鶴見的現狀，也得曉急於要W君在北平的情形，她因無法使用通訊器具，也就無法探取這兩方面的情况，當然感覺沉悶。可是我覺得「情報第一。」</p>
<p>「也好……」耀羣眼光閃爍了一下。</p>
<p>「昨天我們探到坂垣，酒井，鈴木，三隊組合，今天就要進攻南口，這話有幾分確實吧？」我首先提出了這一條。</p>
<p>「對的，照說昨晚就發動了，」耀羣點着頭，「可直抵現在，還聽不見什麽，未必眞的就讓他們這們安安靜靜，衝過去了？」</p>
<p>「那不能。」我吿解耀羣；「湯部十三軍，一星期前就趕到佈防了，決不能讓他們這麽輕易過去。」</p>
<p>「我說呢，」耀羣似乎鬆了一口氣，「那敢情好，我可以專管一面了；只要把幾位大爺攝出了圈了，我們趕去，還來得及！」</p>
<p>「趕到什麼地方？……什麽事？」我覺得耀羣的口氣，並非專指山西設立支部的事；好像另有比這更重要的工作。</p>
<p>耀羣聽我這麽一問，立刻閃動着那已經上了黃色的眼珠，定睛打量了我一下，表示有些惶惑：「不能吧……！您還還沒知道松部已經同咱們的劉大將軍，劉汝明，有了應酬」這「應酬」二字，用得幽默</p>
<p>「噢！」這個情報，確呌我吃了一驚：「這位劉軍長是山西的體已人物，是正式班底，是山西的「資本」之一……他要給鬼子特務釣上了鈞，簡直等於折山西的台，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「可不是？」耀羣冷笑着。他駐守着山西心臘外圍，——從咽喉到胃囊—……</p>
<p>「這個消息……？」我想問耀羣「這消息的來原及其眞實性；」因我有些不敢相信。假如這是一個不折不扣的消息，西北半壁，至少山西河北這一圈，就危險了。換句話，南口也沒有什麼保守的價值了；縱然捨命抵抗一陣，那也僅是白白犧性一些軍隊罷了。</p>
<p>「百分之百的確實！」耀羣早明瞭了我的心意，這般斬釘截鐵的答覆我：「松組首腦命令的存根，張北支部的情報，活動費的數目，我一都見過……我……」躍羣說到這裏，忽然「咦」了一聲，好像想起了什麽，吃了一驚，問着我：「您到昌平有多大工夫？……什麽時候離開北平？」</p>
<p>我吿訴她昨天才離北平，也是昨天到的昌平。</p>
<p>「那奇怪！」耀羣有些驚愕的神色；「難道總隊長沒透給您，……關於這個消息？」</p>
<p>我知道耀羣爲什麽驚愕，大概她沒有知道她的情報走得那麽慢：「總部一共只收到你三次情報，這第三次情報，還是我動身後半小時之收到。」這是有關係的事實，我不能永遠瞒住她。</p>
<h3>午夢難成</h3>
<p>— 孟農</p>
<p>喫過了午飯以後的一刻鐘或半小時，可以說是屬於我自己的。如果照古人的想法，正可以焚一爐香，煮一壺茶，手一卷書，自然是別有一番幽趣。</p>
<p>我可不希望有（自然也不可能有）這樣的生活。我只想打一個中覺，不看什麼，不做什麼，甚至連思索什麼的習慣也暫時屏除，這就儘够使我進入怡然，恬然，優哉，遊哉的世界了。</p>
<p>疏簾半卷，一榻橫陳，舒舒服服地隨意躺下，不穿長袴和長襪，儘是伸展着四肢，閉上了眼皮，先是假裝着小睡，不一回，便呼呼睡去。這樣幸福的午睡，是閒人的常事，但在我想來，倒正是忙人的閒情，正是可遇而不可求的緣分，人間的無上幸福了。</p>
<p>靠近北窗，原是一個鄰家的荒園，不，簡直是藏垢納汚的垃圾堆。爛鐵罐，枯草，汚泥，堆疊成小山一樣，太陽照射下去，蒸發出一股說不出的惡臭。蚊子，蒼蠅，虻蟲，都在那裏打滾，亂舞，自然是成爲了牠們的樂園一般的好地方。</p>
<p>不打開北窗，嫌太熟悶；打開了罷，又感到莫名的難受。有時，沒奈何，只得這麽打算，開一會兒之後，再閉一會兒，讓我透透氣。然而，這就發生另一個問題來了，我的惺忪的睡眼早已淸醒過來，午夢自然是談不到，想追趕也來不及了。</p>
<p>躺着，躺着，勉勉强强的躺着。討厭的蒼蠅向我的周身圍攻過來了，帶着嗡嗡的繁響，一會兒飛到我的頭部，一會兒又飛回去，好像有意跟我開玩笑。</p>
<p>於是我這時不得不從躺着的狀態中站起來，開始進行驅蠅運動。蒼蠅撲不着，便跟空氣大打回合。</p>
<p>在展開了驟蠅運動之後，好像死的死了，逃的逃了，這才安心下來，想來總可以小睡一下了吧，然而也未必。</p>
<p>最可憎惡的是一種老蒼蠅。老蒼蠅是看慣了驅蠅運動的，所以當我進行驅蠅運動的時候，牠是不慌不忙的，而且知道利用什麼樣的方式去暫避別人對牠的鋒芒。等到這運動歸於安靜之後，牠便從暗角裏突然飛出，飛到天花板上或者電綫上，坐在那裏默默不動，彷彿在偷窺動靜，向人暗笑，或許至少是在打算發動另一個攻勢吧。</p>
<p>午夢難成，也就只好由它去。爲了消磨這難遣的長夏的午後，索性翻開小說罷，說來也眞偶然，也眞凑巧，讀到了瑞典作家拉綺洛孚女士的一篇小說，竟發見了瑞典也有「宰予畫寢」式的人物，不但自己愛好午睡，並且硬要養成他的兒女們睡午覺的習慣。小說中說，一位名呌賴久洛夫的將軍，認爲如果要孩子們長大時成爲健康，精壯，幹練，有用，則第一件要緊事情，就是先要養成他們睡午覺的習慣。因此他每次用過午飯後，總是率領了兩個小女孩子到別墅裏去。但那些女孩子們却並不這樣想。她們把身子向賴將軍身上撲去，糾纏他，拉他的鬍子，拉他的頭髮，跟他開玩笑。玩笑開够了，這才爬進小床裏，裝睡，其實等於裝死，因爲賴將軍是不允許孩子們爬出小床，或發出對話的。賴將軍是睡着了，他的鼾聲却使他的兩個要養成午睡習慣的女兒睡不着了。她們感覺着午睡的可怕，夏天午後長長一段時間的可怕！她們唯一的希望，是在蒼蠅身上。希望蒼蠅帶着嗡嗡聲飛到賴將軍的臉上，響得大聲些，久長些，快快地把他驚醒過來！</p>
<p>她們在午睡的床上受苦，發着咒詛，賴將軍是並不懂得。她們在豔羡窗外不睡午覺的，東奔西跑的，快活逍遙的，喫桃子洋梅的種種樂趣，貪戀午夢的賴將軍又那裏懂得這些？</p>
<h3>鸚哥嘴</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>白樂天陽明洞詩：『鄕味珍彭胡，時鮮貴鷓鴣。」彭湖，與蟹同類，而小於蟹生水邊沙穴中，吳中呼爲沙裏狗。厥色殷紅，俗稱鸚哥嘴。亦作螃蜞。「世說新語」載：『蔡謨渡江，誤食螃蜞，吐下委頓』，吾松則產此物，惟僅食其螯。每至暑夏，輒以鰲肉作羹，味極鮮美，初未聞有食此而瀉痢者。元陶宗儀「輟耕錄」食品條亦有：「松江之上海，杭州之海寗，人皆喜食螃蜞鰲，名日鸚哥嘴，以有極紅者似之故也。』</p>
<h3>湖上之夜</h3>
<p>— 姚妤</p>
<p>夜翼偷偷地伸向湖面。天空漸漸黯暗下去，南高峯和北高峯所總率的羣山朦朧地入睡，在乳白色的天緣畫下了蜿蜓的黑影。一切都模糊了，即使眼力好，也僅僅能眺見一個依稀的輪廓。由於夜給西湖帶來了謐靜和安慰，西湖彷彿比白天更寬敞，更幽美了。</p>
<p>白堤和蘇堤上的路燈貶着慈祥的眼睛。她的光輝嫺雅地穿過湖濱的柳陌和花木，在柏油馬路上構成了黑白分明的鑲着花邊的圖案。當月夜我着了一件薄薄的襯衫打從錦帶橋上走過的時候，我曾經這樣想：關好路電讓皎潔的月光姿意地傾瀉在這夏夜的提上，不是更富於詩意的嗎？西湖的夜好像是屬於人間情侶的。他（她）們悄悄地坐在柳蔭底下，記憶着一串甜蜜的記憶，訴說着說不完的軟語，當甜蜜把兩顆心陶醉了的時候，她（他）們想來一次熱情的擁抱和一次輕快的吻嗎？對於這微弱的路燈，她（他）們會慊它太亮了嗎？然而，一個陰霾霾的黑夜，一個陌生的遠行者，對這開放在黑暗中的聖潔的花朶、又將怎樣來訴說在心坎中的渴望和感激呢？……此，我深深地覺悟到，唯有在黑暗中的光明才眞正值得珍貴；而黑暗與光明又永恒在戰鬥呵！……</p>
<p>湖濱到處坐滿了人，當夜湖乍然飄來了一絲淸風，大家會不約而同地來一個會心的微笑。這，沁人肺腑的快感，的確不是喫棒冰和冰洪淋所能領略的啊！只要在公園或店門前排上一把眠椅，就成一舖理想的床；就可以袒裼着胸脯鼾然入睡了。牆角堆滿都市的渣滓——衣衫襤褸的乞丐，他們做着不同的夏夜之夢，夢見拾黃金，也夢見秋的來到，冬的來到……他們雖則沒有羅帳和DDT來抵抗蚊子和跳蚤，他們畢竟有伴了。……</p>
<p>此刻，該是藍色的螢光畫過茫茫的黑夜，淸風搖曳密集的禾葉，紡織娘和蝦蟆在田隴間伴奏悠揚的夜曲的時分了。然而，久住都市的我，又向何處去尋找呢？我眞想有一個月白風清的晚上，讓我投向原野，讓我重溫一次鄕村夏夜的情調啊！……</p>

<p>前一個時候，物價奔騰前進，似無繮的野馬，無法使他停止，一切貨物的標價，跳躍得使人未能置信；商人却對主顧們訴苦地說生意難做，賣出一件物品，他們等於蝕本，因爲批價已跳過了他們門市的價格，所以，他們總說與其「補不進」，不如不賣。</p>
<p>但是，最近一個時候，一切物價都在下瀉，金鈔黑市，上等白粳，及聰頭物品，都下降了三分之一，這是數月以來，很少看見的事情。</p>
<p>不過使我們奇怪的是，有許多物品，標價並未减低。如西藥，前一時美金黑市高昂時的價格，現在仍矻然不動；又如許多美國貨，他們批價雖然降低了，伹是門市的標價仍然「高高在上」</p>
<p>這種商人的算盤，與商人的心理，往往很難使人心折。我們很同情商人在現在一樣有他們的「煩惱」，但是他們只有「自己」沒有「主顧」的態度，是不能取得一般人的同情的。</p>
<p>我們覺得這時候，商人應該自動貶價，使主顧們能變換一下對商人的心理與看法。</p>
<p>米價落到三十多萬，金鈔黑市瀉了二分之一，我們的商人，物價爲什麼不設法抑平一點？</p>

<h3>苦惱的朝鮮</h3>
<p>— 溥倫</p>
<p>編者按：最近美蘇在朝鮮的談判，似乎不很順利，全世界賢明的人士，都關心着美蘇關係今後的發展。編者特請溥倫先生介紹關於朝鮮的地理形勢，對於讀者，多少是有點益處的吧。</p>
<p>剛掙脫了日本奴役的苦難的朝鮮，並沒有獲得她所企望的自由和平等，而祗變成了民主和共產兩大思想的試騐室，是的，北緯三十八度，就好像一把血淋淋的利刃，將朝鮮切成兩段；南部飄揚着星條旗幟，北部飄揚着鐮刀斧頭旗幟。最有趣的是這兩個地區同樣被當做「民主的搖籃」。</p>
<p>這個具有五千年的悠久歷史的古國，經濟上和政治上的落後，以至戰略地理上的重要，把朝鮮歷史渲染着很不光輝的顏色；這「三位一體」的三種因素，竟然變成了一條鎖鍊緊緊地縛住她，給她在這麽悠長的過程中，尋找不出一個適當美滿的歸宿。</p>
<p>朝鮮是亞洲的一個大半島，突出於日本海與黃海之間，東臨日本海與日本相對；南瀕朝鮮海峽；西臨黃海，和我國河北，山東兩省相望；北面以長白山脈，鴨綠江及圖們江的一部，和我國的遼寗，吉林以及蘇聯的西伯利亞爲界。正因爲她北速滿洲，蘇聯，東方又接近日本的緣故，形成了她的重要的戰略地位，於是乎日本帝國主義者拿她做進入亞洲大陸的跳板，與攫取滿洲和進攻蘇聯的基地。</p>
<p>這種地理上的因素，固然是一種很大的誘惑，但却不是主導的原因。經濟上和政治上的落後，才是它的主導原因。朝鮮在淪爲日本殖民地之前，在經濟上還停留在農業社會的狀態中，在政治上則仍然在專制的封建制度下。朝鮮的土地制度，一向在原則上都是國有的。到了高句麗時代，土地制度更實際的變爲國有制了。國王不單是政治，軍事的最高主權者，同時是國家土地的最高所有渚，人民對於土地祗有耕作權而無所有權，在政治上，朝鮮一向被專制的封建勢力統治着。因此，便葬送了朝鮮民族的獨立與自由！</p>
<p>日本侵略朝鮮，這在十六世紀末葉便開始了，日本的封建領主豐臣秀吉的三十五萬的軍隊，經過了七年的攻打，並沒有把朝鮮打跨，反而自動退却了。但日本人却帶走了許多學者和工匠，並且帶走了三萬隻醃潰的朝鮮人的耳朵和鼻子。這之後，日本對朝鮮的野心一點也不放鬆，就在一九一〇年正式吞併了朝鮮。</p>
<p>但日本帝國主義者的高度壓榨，却培育了朝鮮民族解放運動的根苗。朝鮮民族解放運動的發展，大概可以分爲三個主要階段：自一九一〇年起至一九一九年的「三一」革命止，爲第一階段；「三一」革命以後，到中國抗日戰爭暴發，爲第二階段；在第二次世界大戰期間，爲第三階段。日本屈膝後，又踏入新的階段。</p>
<p>現在朝鮮的劃分，是將朝鮮的江原道幾乎劃成兩個相爭的部份，黃海道的一部份，爲美軍佔領區，京畿道的一小部份爲蘇軍佔區。美軍佔區有三六，七六一餘平方里，佔全朝鮮面積百分之四三，一，蘇軍佔區有四八，四八七平方里，佔全面積百分之五六，九〇以人口論，美軍區的人口佔朝鮮總人口的三分之二，直至最近己有變動，很可能蘇軍佔領區的人口有百分之四十，美佔領區有百分之六十。</p>

<h3>林則徐</h3>
<p>— 季明</p>
<p>林文忠公不同於淸代其他名臣者，厥惟鴉片一戰，時公任兩廣總督，力主禁烟，並收繳英人躉船鴉片，十逾其八，得旨裏獎，道光帝且手敕報曰：「旣有此番舉動，若再示柔弱，則大不可，朕不慮卿等孟浪，但誠卿等不可畏葸，先威後德，控制之良法也。」蓋戰事初起時，淸帝尙龐然自大也，旣敗，公戍伊犂。</p>
<p>史載，則徐字元撫，一字少穆，福建閩侯人，身長不滿六尺，英光四射，聲如洪鐘，每劇談，隔舍數重，聽之亦了了，年二十七，成進士，道光三年，擢江蘇按察使，決獄平恕，民稱之爲林靑天，尤長於水利任湖廣總督時，荆襄苦小患，公修堤督工，水患悉平。議戍時，道出開封，河決，留公督辦，工成，仍就戍，蓋謫戍之命，原非淸室本意，第英人要脅，不得委屈從之耳。公旣至關外，奉命勘辨開墾事宜，親歷庫車阿克蘇，葉爾羌，及伊拉里克等城，從橫三萬里，水利大興。稍暇，則以筆墨自娛。公書本歐陽，詩宗白傅，伊犂雖爲邊省大都會，不數月，縑楮一空矣。在伊四載，旣還，漸次復職，後官雲貴總督。道光三十年，洪楊軍興，奉命以欽差大臣督師，未抵，卒於道中。論者謂公優於曾文正，蓋文正不明種族之辨，而公則未與洪楊交綏也，其然乎？</p>
<h3>西公旗慘案主角：奇俊峯女王</h3>
<p>— 秀堂</p>
<p>據廿五日報載：烏盟西公旗女王及莫子幼王奇法武，在公廈地方，被該旗保安團長郝游龍率部刺殺，兇案傳出，邊界震動，該慘案眞相究竟如何，有關常局現尚在澈査中，奇俊峯女王與東公旗額王夫人巴雲英，同爲蒙古著名的抗日女王，在戰時，領導蒙胞支持中央抗戰，極著功勳。</p>
<p>奇俊峯女王是烏盟西公旗扎薩克石拉布多爾濟（石王）的福音，她的父親在淸末是寗夏阿拉善旗有革命思想的一位王公，因此被革去王位放逐在外，她就隨着太夫人旅居北平，在這時她便學習蒙漢文字，她的天資聰穎，長於口才與交際，民國廿一年，她以十八歲的芳齡與石王結婚。</p>
<p>廿四年時，西公旗東協理額寶齋與石王之堂叔大喇嘛伊喜達格登勾結，受德王之嗾使，發生變亂，先後經過二年，後幸爲駐軍敉平，這是她結婚不久，隨石王所經歷的一段患難，也是磨練她才能的一個塲面。廿五年，石王去世，她這時才廿二歲，就作了靑春的寡婦，幸而已懷孕在身，石王的左右想乘機推前任管旗眾克薩格都爾扎布襲繼石王的扎薩古職位，但她以身孕男女朱明，堅特反對，結果以薩任東協理兼護理扎薩克印務的妥協辦法而了事，這事的處理，充分表現了她的勇氣與政治才幹，果然二十六年她產生一子名阿勒騰鄂齊爾，於是繼承不成問題了。這位阿勒騰鄂齊爾，也就是這次同遭殺書的幼王奇法武。</p>
<p>廿六年七七事變，西公旗爲敵騎侵入，東協理薩格都爾扎布，西協理色令呵勒　鄂齊爾屈膝降敵，勾結前次變亂之額　齊，刧奪印信，威逼利誘無所不至，而女王仍不稍爲動。在生命危險艱苦困難的環境下，勇敢的奇俊峯女王不得不毅然携老毌　子出亡，於廿七年二月二十四日夜半逃出虎口，重整部隊，執行蒙旗抗戰任務。中樞對她的持志忠貞，深爲嘉許，正式任命她爲西公旗扎薩克兼防守司令，未久又兼任綏境蒙政會委員及緩遠蒙旗黨務特派員，蒙古歷史中女性任一旗行政首長的扎薩克和軍職的防守司令，及黨政工作，她算是破夭荒的第一人。（廿五日）</p>
<h3>淸官的末路</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>大公報本市新聞版刋哉着一條前鹽務總局總辦張繡文公開求職的消息，我帶着無限的同情讀完它，心裏感覺得非常悵惘。</p>
<p>那條消息開頭這樣說：「生活逼人，前任全國鹽政局局長……投書本報讀者之頁求職……」，生活逼人是不錯的，然而竟使得從古以來被公認爲肥缺的鹽局政務員，在卸任之後，也感覺到生活的逼人，豈非怪事？</p>
<p>問題倒不是生活已經能够逼一得貴爲鹽局局長的活不下去，而是像張氏這樣一位歷任鹽局公務員達卅五年之久的官員，不但在卸肩之後，未能攸游歲月以養夭年，甚而在「生活逼人」之餘，不能不拉下面皮，向社會人士訴苦和求助。</p>
<p>這眞是「淸官」的末路，同時更說明了淸官甚不可爲，兩袖淸風如今已成爲歷史上的名辭了，想不到在今生今世居然看得到這樣一個人，在用這種過時的迂腐思想，爲自己掘墳墓，使妻　跟着受苦。</p>
<p>民國以來的鹽官不必談，先說漢承秦弊之後，豪强擅專鹽鐵之利，所謂：「鹽利所入，上不在國，下不在民，而唯飽鹽吏之私囊，國家之鹽稅收入，曾不足以償役員之俸給。」這也就是漢書上說的「夭下賦輪，或不足償其僦費」的了。鹽吏的豪富，非特「交通王侯，力過吏勢」，而且極盡人間豪奢之能事，淸季鹽官的酒肉笙歌，坊問小說皆有詳載的。</p>
<p>因此，我們覺得張先生在這種積弊將近二千年的鹽政任內，不能「與郡縣通姦，多張空簿，府　不實，人民愁苦……」，這正是今日爲生活所逼的前因。</p>
<p>以一位普通的鹽官來說，不論是漢晋元明，以至淸末或民國，假若「圓通」一點，目前在上海做寓公，三五輛「史都匹克」，三五幢花園洋房是不爲過的，何况以一位曾經服務鹽政埀三十五年之久，貴爲總局總辦之尊的張先生，還第到公開求職，而求職的條件又訂得這末「可憐」！</p>
<p>據記者走訪後的報導，認爲</p>
<p>張氏：「早年參加革命，後任職財政部，繼轉鹽務總局，在職卅餘年。抗戰初期，任川康鹽管局局長……務總局改組爲鹽政局後，任第一任局長……」，單看這一　　歷，如果不是大公報的忠實報導，我們也許要表示懷疑的。</p>
<p>從張先生的求職起，不禁想到我的許多地位遠不及張氏監局的朋友，請客以大卡車運　酒和肉，做籌一請就是幾十檯的塲面來。</p>
<p>我是吃過鹽官酒食的人，從來也不會想到天下還會有窮困如我的鹽官。張先生的事，一方面證明了淸官已走上了末路，再也不該有人去幹了，另一方面也可以說明，有許多人在職時，並不肥如豐官，去職後居然可以在上海大做其闊寓公，其不　說之處，一想就可以明白了。</p>

<h3>Grand Meeting of the Land Tax Conference Held: Chairman Explains the Significance of Grain Collection, Zhang Qun Announces Nine Key Points of Grain Administration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Chairman Chiang attended the Land Tax Conference for the 36th year at 10:00 AM on the 27th and gave instructions to all attendees. He stated that, in order for the government to accomplish the task of suppressing the rebellion and saving the people, it must first ensure sufficient food and soldiers. Therefore, grain collection and conscription are the two major central tasks for local governments in the future. The provincial chairmen and land tax officials must collectively take responsibility for improving land tax operations, eliminating past malpractices, and striving to truly meet the principles of fairness. He also hoped that the provincial councils and local gentry would provide assistance in various ways so that government orders could be smoothly implemented. Most importantly, government officials and gentry should lead by example in complying with government laws and regulations, paying land taxes, and fulfilling military service, thereby setting an example for the people. Only in this way can the goals of sufficient food and soldiers be achieved, and the great cause of unified national construction be completed.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Land Tax Conference for the 36th year opened at 9:00 AM on the 27th in the auditorium of the Executive Yuan. Attendees included provincial chairmen, speakers of provincial councils, directors of land tax bureaus, and central leaders Wang Yunwu, Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Yu Feipeng, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Wu Dingchang, Gan Naiguang, Pang Songzhou, Chen Liang, and more than eighty others. Premier Zhang chaired the meeting and delivered the opening remarks, stating that this conference was based on the "Continuing Collection and Borrowing of Grain in Kind for Land Tax" case passed by the seventh State Council meeting on the 18th of this month. The Executive Yuan, based on this principle, has drafted the "Implementation Measures for the Collection of Land Tax in Kind and Borrowing in Kind for the 36th Year." He hoped that all attendees would actively offer their opinions and conduct thorough discussions to fulfill the mission of this conference. At 10:00 AM, Chairman Chiang arrived at the meeting to give instructions and left after half an hour. Subsequently, the first general meeting was held, chaired by Premier Zhang, who announced the "Implementation Measures for Collection and Borrowing in Kind for the 36th Year" drafted by the Executive Yuan. The meeting adjourned at 11:20 AM. The second general meeting was held at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Premier Zhang. Various units presented their opinions on the collection and borrowing in kind. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The 28th will be for provincial discussions.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] Premier Zhang officially read out the key points related to grain collection at the first general meeting of the grain conference, divided into nine items, providing detailed instructions on the current grain administration:</p>
<p>The first item is the necessity of continuing the collection and borrowing, pointing out that the government originally decided to stop the collection and borrowing this year. However, due to the Communist bandits' rejection of peace talks and launching of rebellion, the government had to implement general mobilization and engage in suppressing the rebellion. Military actions were difficult to stop for a time, and the need for military grain naturally could not be reduced. The government's grain collection this year was insufficient, so it decided to continue the collection and borrowing. This is a measure that the government was compelled to take.</p>
<p>The second item, the standards and amounts for collection in kind, will still be handled in accordance with the original plan previously negotiated between the Ministry of Food and the provinces.</p>
<p>The third item, the areas for collection in kind and collection in currency should be designated immediately. While the provincial chairmen, speakers, or their representatives, and land tax officials are in Nanjing, the Ministry of Food should immediately, based on the central and local needs for actual quantities of goods, and taking into account the grain production and transportation conditions of each county, jointly designate the areas for collection in kind and collection in currency to facilitate implementation. Areas with greater grain needs should still collect and borrow as much as possible in kind to ensure supply.</p>
<p>The fourth item, the collection quotas and borrowing quotas must be fully met. The amount of collection in kind and collection in currency this year is the same as or lower than last year, and the borrowing is based on a one-to-one ratio. For some areas, it may be slightly higher than last year, but the total amount still does not fully meet the needs. It is hoped that the responsible agencies will strictly supervise and urge the handling of the matter, and it is particularly hoped that the provincial and county public opinion organs will cooperate in promoting and assisting in various ways to ensure that the quotas are fully met within the time limit.</p>
<p>The fifth item, the grain collected by provincial and county-level agencies on Sundays should be allocated immediately after collection. The central government's purchase of grain has been negotiated and determined by the Ministry of Food separately, and the price payment method is also quite fair. It is deeply hoped that the local authorities will first transport the grain to be purchased by the central government to areas with convenient transportation for easy concentration and allocate it as soon as possible. Before the rice is fully allocated, all collected grain shall not be misappropriated or used.</p>
<p>The sixth item, the proceeds from currency conversions should be immediately deposited into the treasury as soon as they are collected, and any retention is strictly prohibited to prevent currency circulation. Those who misappropriate funds without authorization should be severely punished.</p>
<p>The seventh item, public opinion organs assisting in carrying out the work of suppressing the rebellion and resisting foreign aggression are important. Public opinion organs must do their best to convey the government's policies so that the people understand the shared difficulties and rise up together to actively contribute.</p>
<p>The eighth item, establish universal supervisory agencies for collection and borrowing to eliminate corruption. Corruption is unavoidable in the collection of actual goods and currency. Supervisory committees for the collection and borrowing of actual goods at all levels must be universally established and strengthen their organization to achieve the effect of eliminating corruption and promoting integrity.</p>
<p>The ninth item, improve collection methods and work hard to supervise collection. In addition to the collection in kind this year, borrowing and public grain will still be collected as before. The burden on the people cannot be said to be light. The handling agencies must be dedicated to serving the public and loving the country, while also being considerate of the people's needs, clearly setting legal standards, diligently serving, and the quality of collection procedures will be the main items for assessment, rewards, and punishments. It is hoped that everyone will work hard together to achieve complete success.</p>
<p>Premier Zhang Submits Methods for Discussion, Grain Officials from Various Provinces Offer Opinions, Report to be Submitted to the General Assembly After Approval</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Land Tax Conference held its second general meeting at 4:00 PM on the 27th to discuss the "Implementation Measures for the Collection of Land Tax in Kind and Borrowing of Grain for the 36th Year" submitted by Premier Zhang, chaired by Yu Feipeng. The speakers of the provincial councils were the first to speak, raising many opinions on the grain collection methods, and generally believed that there were many difficulties in implementing grain administration at present. Subsequently, the provincial chairmen and the directors of the provincial grain bureaus provided concrete opinions and made some revisions to the implementation measures. Finally, Yu Feipeng made a conclusion, saying that he would report to Premier Zhang and submit a report to the general meeting on the 30th. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures</p>
<p>The main points of the implementation measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding collection and borrowing: (1) In order to coordinate with the needs of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, land tax in various provinces and cities this year should still focus on collecting in kind and borrowing grain as much as possible. However, for municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan and a few areas in the provinces with inconvenient transportation and low grain production, land tax and borrowed grain may be converted into currency based on the highest grain price month before the start of collection in the local area, subject to approval. The conversion standard should be based on the ability to purchase an equal amount of physical goods in neighboring areas. The areas for conversion into currency and the conversion standards shall be determined by the Ministry of Food. (2) The principal and interest of grain bonds due this year should be offset from the central government's share of the collection and borrowing. Grain bonds will not be issued for grain borrowed this year, and no interest will be calculated. Starting from 1952, they will be offset in equal installments over five years. (3) Borrowing is based on a one-to-one ratio. (4) Public grain is based on 30% of the collection in kind in principle. If provincial and county-level finances are difficult, it may be collected up to 50% with the consent of the public opinion organs. (5) Land tax should be fully collected within three months after the start of collection. (6) No additional taxes or levies may be imposed on land.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding allocation and purchase: (1) All proceeds from borrowing grain shall be transferred to the central government. For the land tax portion, 30% goes to the central government, 20% to the province, and 50% to the county or city, 40% to municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and 60% to the city. (2) The physical goods belonging to the local portion shall be purchased by the central government for unified allocation. (3) The grain obtained from borrowing shall be allocated to military grain first.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding agency expenses (omitted)</p>
<p>(D) Regarding supervision and oversight: (1) Agencies at all levels should fully promote the collection and borrowing in kind and ensure that it is fully collected within the time limit. Those who handle the matter poorly or engage in bribery shall be severely punished in accordance with the law. (2) The supervisory committees for borrowing grain shall be established universally within a time limit.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Chengdu, 27th dispatch] In order to strengthen the suppression of rebellion, the central government has decided that the quota for borrowing grain in Sichuan Province this year will be 10 million shi in principle.</p>
<h3>Provincial Chairmen Hold Talks</h3>
<p>[Another dispatch] The government convened the Land Tax Conference to coordinate with the general mobilization and strengthen the military's suppression of the Communists, discussing the issue of collection and borrowing in order to ensure sufficient food and soldiers. In order to coordinate and comply with the Chairman's instructions, the provincial chairmen held talks at the International Recreation Club at 8:00 PM on the 27th to discuss various technical issues. Premier Zhang convened a symposium with the provincial chairmen on the evening of the 28th to exchange opinions. In addition, the Ministry of Food will also convene a meeting of the directors of the provincial land tax bureaus within a few days to discuss and decide on the technical issues of collection and borrowing.</p>
<h3>Experts Believe Now is Not the Time to Reform the Monetary System</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] Opinions are divided here on whether the monetary system should be reformed at this time. This reporter interviewed another economic authority on the 27th, who believed that monetary reform is not the right time at present. His views are quite different from those who advocate immediate reform. He pointed out that very few countries reform their monetary systems during wartime, because many changes during turbulent times can easily cause disturbances. Our country must not take this risk. Furthermore, in terms of our country's current reserves, without foreign support, it is not enough to cope with this matter. Unless the United States can lend us 1.5 billion to 2 billion US dollars, half of which is used for construction and half for reform reserves, it will be difficult to achieve this. He believes that even if reform is carried out immediately, it is only a transitional measure to "treat the pain." A "healthy" and permanent monetary system can only be established after stability.</p>
<h3>Central Government Appoints Wu Qiwai as Deputy Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 27th dispatch] The central government has appointed Wu Qiwai as Deputy Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and he will fly to Beiping to take office within the next few days. In addition, the Beiping and Baoding Pacification Headquarters are discussing joint defense matters, planning to establish a large mobile corps on the Beiping-Ning line to respond to sudden incidents inside and outside Shanhaiguan at any time.</p>
<h3>Qingyuan and Other Counties in Liaoning Province Reassigned to Andong and Liaobei</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 27th dispatch] The Pacification Headquarters ordered the Liaoning Provincial Government to reassign Qingyuan and Xinbin counties under its jurisdiction to Andong Province, and Kangping, Faku, and Zhangwu counties to Liaobei Province, effective August 10.</p>
<h3>Jilin Organizes Commando Teams to Go Deep into Communist Areas to Launch Guerrilla Warfare, Liang Huasheng Leads Reporters to Visit Baishan Summer Camp</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Changchun, 27th dispatch] Chairman Liang Huasheng led reporters to visit the Jilin Baishan Summer Camp yesterday. The camp is located at the foot of Xiaobaishan Mountain, and the participants are administrative and educational cadres. Commando team members organized by Chairman Liang also participated. Jilin Province is organizing commando teams throughout the province. These commando teams will go deep into Communist areas to launch extensive guerrilla warfare. General Liang Huasheng is the most energetic leader. The Baishan Summer Camp he presides over is full of vitality and fighting spirit. He is determined to lead the people of Jilin to make great contributions to the country and the nation between Baishan and Heilongjiang. In addition, more than a dozen reporters from Changchun and Jilin are scheduled to take cars to Siping on the morning of the 28th for a visit and to inspect the damage to the China Changchun Railway.</p>
<h3>Investigation Work Comes to an End, Wedemeyer Returns to the Capital Today, Will Come to Shanghai Again Within Ten Days to Continue Inspection</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party are scheduled to fly back to Nanjing at 9:00 AM this morning. The investigation team believes that the work in Shanghai, due to the short time, is only a "good start." Therefore, one or two experts from the team will be sent to Shanghai again in the short term to sort out the information obtained. According to personnel close to the investigation team, Wedemeyer and his entourage may all come to Shanghai again within ten days for further investigation and research, but the time cannot be determined yet. Special Envoy Wedemeyer was busy all day yesterday. Because yesterday was Sunday, he drove a Samsung car to Jiangxi Road Cathedral at 10:00 AM to attend a prayer service.</p>
<h3>President of the American Chamber of Commerce Submits Important Documents, Hoping to Improve Trade Conditions</h3>
<p>The US Consul General Davis hosted a banquet at noon, during which the President of the American Chamber of Commerce, Smith, handed over important documents to Special Envoy Wedemeyer. According to what reporters have learned from various sources, the contents are approximately as follows: (1) Although the Central Government has stipulated the division of state-owned and private enterprises, it has not been effectively implemented, which has hindered the development of foreign-owned private enterprises. (2) Regarding import and export restrictions, they often increase the necessary raw materials for Chinese export products cannot be imported into China, while luxury goods and non-essential consumer goods can be imported instead. At the same time, many goods that have been prohibited from import by the government are still imported. Furthermore, regarding the import quota system, often long-established merchants cannot obtain permits for a long time, while newly opened companies can obtain them first. (3) After the signing of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, both parties should have equal and reciprocal treatment in accordance with the treaty, but in fact, there is considerable discrimination against American merchants. All of this seems unfair and unreasonable, and the American side deeply regrets it. Therefore, it is hoped that before the United States provides assistance to China, the above situation should be improved as soon as possible. In the afternoon, Special Envoy Wedemeyer began to receive Chinese and American guests. Party figures such as Zhang Junli of the Democratic Socialist Party and Li Huang of the Youth Party visited successively, and it was heard that they all emphasized that the government needs to make further reorganization and exchanged opinions on current affairs. Government officials Song Ziwen and Chen Guangfu also visited, but the content of the talks is unknown. Flying Tiger General Chennault, who served in the China theater with Wedemeyer during the war, also took time to visit yesterday. In addition, many Chinese and foreign people visited Special Envoy Wedemeyer yesterday. Due to time constraints, most of them could not be received in person, and were received by members of the team on their behalf. Special Envoy Wedemeyer expressed his deep apology for this and said that all opinions have been reported in detail by his staff.</p>
<h3>Invited to a Banquet by the Mayor, Meeting with Various Circles, Dismissed at 11:00 PM</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for all the members of the delegation at his residence on Anfu Road at 8:00 PM, and those invited to accompany them included Speaker Pan, Li Fusun, Li Shuxiong, Yan Huiqing, and figures from the business community. The conversation was very pleasant until around 11:00 PM. According to relevant personnel, this was a normal social event and not Special Envoy Wedemeyer's intention to solicit opinions from the Chinese business community. Therefore, the invited business people were all those who had friendships with the Americans and were proficient in English, rather than representatives of the Shanghai Chinese business community.</p>
<p>According to people close to Special Envoy Wedemeyer, "The investigation team has decided to go to Shenyang, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao and Taiwan for inspection, which will take place in the last day or two of this week. First go to North China and Northeast China, and then to Taiwan Province. Due to time constraints, it is impossible to carry out thorough investigations everywhere. In some areas, we will try our best to use the results of other people's research, summarize and analyze them, and then make independent judgments. Because the investigation team still has to go to South Korea, the period in China is only one month. One week is used for general research and discussion, and the actual investigation time is only three weeks. In this short period of time, in order to maximize the effectiveness of the work, the investigation team decided to maintain maximum contact with all circles. If there are those who contribute opinions and data, regardless of whether they are experts or not, they are welcome. This type of data is summarized, analyzed, and then objectively judged and measured. Our investigation work in your country focuses on the goal of China's economic recovery, but if you want to point out what kind of information is most important, it is obviously difficult. This point can be explained with an example. For example, building a large sluice gate. In a stable and orderly country, the materials required, the basics required, and the completion time can all be estimated. However, under China's current unstable situation, this matter is related to politics, military, and economy, and it is no longer a simple engineering problem. Therefore, the types of information collected by the investigation team are extensive, and it is not possible to point out which data is the most important.</p>
<h3>The Impressions Gained in Shanghai Will Have an Official Statement</h3>
<p>As for the investigation team's impressions in Shanghai, there will be a formal written statement issued by the US Information Service."</p>
<p>In other news, former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt is scheduled to fly to Nanjing by China Airlines flight this morning. The rumor that he will fly to Nanjing on the same plane as General Wedemeyer is not true.</p>

It is believed that after implementation, financial control will be effective.</p>
<h3>Chairman Receives American Reporters, Hoping to Jointly Find a Solution to the Problem of Inaccurate Reports and Essays to Avoid Hindering Relations</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] A group of ten American reporters, including Burton Crane, one reporter from the United Press, one reporter from the Hearst newspaper group and two escort officers, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai by plane at 10:30 AM on the 27th. After being hosted at a luncheon by the chief of the US military advisory group, they visited Premier Zhang Qun. From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, they attended a cocktail party held by Director Dong Xianguang of the Information Bureau at the International Recreation Club. More than 100 Chinese and foreign reporters in Nanjing attended and enjoyed each other's company. At 5:30 PM, they were accompanied by spokesperson Morsels of the US Embassy to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. At 7:00 PM, they attended a dinner hosted by Ambassador Stuart. They left Nanjing for Shanghai at 11:00 PM that night. The group spent the whole day in Nanjing in the hot weather, and there was almost no rest time between each program, which they found very tiring. They very much hoped to have more opportunities for free activities in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] Chairman Chiang met with the American reporters on the 27th and delivered a speech, requesting joint cooperation to solve the problem of reports and essays that are prone to misunderstandings, stating that a part of the American reporters stationed in China, due to dissatisfaction with China's post-war situation, wrote reports and essays that not only criticized the incompetence of the National Government, but also misled the American public into believing that the Chinese people as a whole have no respect for value and should not enjoy the friendship of the United States and other countries. This is a serious obstacle to Sino-American cooperation and is enough to damage the honor and self-esteem of the Chinese people. I am deeply concerned. The Chinese people will always be friends of the United States and are grateful for your country's assistance. Our government welcomes any constructive criticism, but if it tends to be extreme, so as to damage the honor and self-esteem of the people, it may affect the friendly relations between the two countries. The Chairman also made his first statement on the mission of Special Envoy Wedemeyer, stating that I fully understand the importance of Sino-American relations and the significance of Wedemeyer's mission to China. The Communist Party issue will not prevent China from implementing the constitution this Christmas. The National Government will fulfill its wartime promises, create a constitutional government, and protect individual freedoms. Since Marshal Ma's mediation failed, the CCP has brazenly continued to pursue a policy of open rebellion, and it is no longer possible to resume peace talks. I hereby assure you that no matter how complex and difficult this issue is, the National Government will be able to solve it soon.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch] A member of the American press corps said: The group's impression of Japan was quite good. The Japanese people all looked very docile, and the occupying forces were quite satisfied with this. The living standards of the Japanese people are very low, but there is no famine. The main purpose of MacArthur's rule in Japan at this stage is to reduce the occupying forces' annual administrative expenses of 3 million US dollars. Therefore, there are measures to allow the Japanese to whale in the Antarctic and to prepare to open up their trade. However, this is not unconditional or unrestricted. MacArthur's main plan is to enable the Japanese to have the economic conditions for independent living after the Allied forces end their occupation. For example, in the case of whaling, the Japanese fishing equipment and tools are in urgent need of reorganization and replenishment, which cannot affect Australia's interests in the short term. As for foreign trade, after the demilitarization and dismantling of heavy industry, it will be difficult for Japan to restore its pre-war imperialist style within three to five years and endanger the development of other countries' industry and commerce. They are very concerned about Chinese public opinion's criticism of MacArthur's style of governing Japan, and regret the haste of their itinerary. They were only able to see the sights on a cursory tour, and were neither able to enter the problem areas nor to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation in the places they passed through. Along the way, in addition to accepting invitations to talk and meeting with dignitaries, they were only able to catch a glimpse of the market scene in Shanghai and Nanjing from the train station. Therefore, they attach great importance to the opinions of their Chinese colleagues.</p>
<h3>Disasterous Drought in Yikezhao League, Sui Province Government Seeking Relief, Quickly Raising Funds to Purchase Grain to Provide Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Gui Sui, 27th dispatch] After the Communist bandits captured Sanbian, they are actively preparing to invade Yikezhao League. Now there is a drought in Yikezhao League, and the Sui Province government is urgently seeking effective relief in order to stabilize the society of Yikezhao League. Chairman Ji of the Sui Province government convened an emergency meeting yesterday and decided to establish the Yikezhao League Drought Relief Committee to quickly raise funds to purchase grain and provide emergency relief. According to repeated reports from the three counties and seven banners of Yikezhao League, the 260,000 Mongolian and Han people in the entire territory of Yikezhao League have generally fallen into a state of famine. People and animals have already starved to death, and there have been incidents of grain robbery. It is no exaggeration to describe the current situation in Yikezhao League as "thousands of miles of red land and wailing everywhere." The Sui Province government is paying close attention to this. The Yikezhao League Drought Relief Committee will actively carry out its work.</p>
<h3>I Have No Intention of Squeezing Out Foreign Businesses; Welcome Friendly Nations to Invest and Offer Preferential Treatment - Remarks by a Committee Member of the National Economic Commission to a Reporter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] During Wei Demai's (Wedemeyer) visit to Shanghai, news came from Shanghai that American businesses were quite dissatisfied with our trade policy and would take advantage of Wei's visit to Shanghai to express their grievances. On the 27th, a reporter interviewed a committee member of the National Economic Commission to inquire about his views on the matter. He said that our special attitude towards Sino-US trade can be studied from two aspects: basic policy and current phenomena. According to his personal observation, we have absolutely no discrimination against American businesses, and we have always welcomed foreign investment. Even if there are some things that are not completely satisfactory, they are not absolutely uncorrectable. In terms of basic policy, in the important documents recently announced or resolved by our authorities, not only are there no restrictions on foreign investment or doing business in China, but they are mostly welcome. In the section on utilizing foreign capital in the "Implementation Principles of the Industrial Construction Program," there are detailed provisions on how to utilize foreign capital, allowing foreign investment in joint ventures in industrial and mining enterprises, allowing foreign investment in private enterprises, and allowing foreigners to invest in and operate businesses independently in China. It is also clearly stipulated that "foreign investment in joint ventures in China shall be fully protected by the Chinese government." Furthermore, in terms of the "First Phase Economic Construction Principles," it is also stipulated that "the proportion of foreign investment in Sino-foreign joint ventures shall not be subject to fixed restrictions, and the selection of general managers of company organizations shall not be limited to nationals, except for the chairman of the board. After review and approval by the government according to the overall construction plan, state-owned enterprises may negotiate with foreign countries for loans or foreign investment by the competent authorities, and private enterprises may also negotiate on their own." In addition, the preamble to the "Economic Reform Plan" recently passed by the National Economic Commission also clearly stipulates that "foreign capital and technical personnel are welcomed in a preferential manner to achieve industrialization." At a recent meeting of the Economic Commission to discuss foreign investment in China, it was stipulated in the industrial policy that all kinds of industries, except for national defense industries and some monopolistic industries, are welcome to American direct investment. The financial policy department stipulates that the taxes and fees levied on foreign businesses operating in our territory should be the same as those for our own people. American businesses can remit a portion of the profits earned from industrial investment in China, and it is stipulated that new tax rules or special regulations will not be promulgated that would hinder the acquisition of profits. From the above decisions, it can be seen that our basic policy expresses welcome and protection for foreign investment, and there should be no discrimination against American businesses.</p>
<p>He continued to point out that, in terms of the current situation, it is undeniable that there are many unsatisfactory aspects. However, there are some facts that seem to need to be brought to the attention of friendly nations: First of all, it should be mentioned that our country is currently in an extraordinary period, and the economic situation is particularly serious. The authorities are trying to find ways to overcome the economic difficulties. Some control measures are unavoidable measures. For example, our foreign exchange reserves are not abundant, so foreign trade cannot but be slightly restricted. Also, what we currently value is how to strengthen construction. Therefore, the import of "non-constructive" materials cannot but be restricted. All of this should not be compared to a "closed-door policy." Another thing that should be noted is that our country has not yet recovered after a long period of war, and the purchasing power of the people is greatly reduced compared to the past. If we look at the current Chinese market with the eyes of the pre-war era, it is inevitable that we will be disappointed. However, some of the measures currently adopted by China are not entirely impossible to correct. At the same time, after China is industrialized with the assistance of foreign capital, the purchasing power of the people can also be improved. It is hoped that this kind of hardship can be understood and given active assistance.</p>

<h3>Issues Regarding the Preliminary Peace Conference with Japan: Britain Proposes a Compromise Suggestion - Foreign Ministers of Eleven Nations Attend the Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] A reporter learned today that the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty may be represented by the foreign ministers of each country, instead of the vice ministers and experts dispatched by each country as originally suggested by the United States. Britain has suggested that the preliminary conference be a meeting of the foreign ministers of each country. However, a State Department official told the Central News Agency reporter today that this meeting will be discussed by the representatives of the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission, rather than a meeting of foreign ministers as suggested by the Soviet Union. If this meeting is a meeting of the foreign ministers of the eleven nations, then the meeting will adopt a two-thirds majority system, and the veto power cannot be applied. (The current meetings of foreign ministers can all use the veto power.) Due to the repeated delays and stalemates in the Paris and London conferences, it is believed that the United States will accept the British proposal for a meeting of the eleven nations' foreign ministers and reject the Soviet proposal for a meeting of the four foreign ministers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 26th] The Canadian Foreign Ministry announced today that Canada believes that the US proposal to convene a preliminary discussion meeting on the Japanese peace treaty of the eleven nations on August 19 conflicts in time with the British Commonwealth's discussion meeting on the Japanese peace treaty scheduled to be held in Canberra on August 26, so it has requested the United States to postpone the date.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] According to the Christian Science Monitor: The US proposal for the Japanese peace treaty has now been fully drafted. The newspaper quoted evidence from authoritative sources that the real debate and controversy in the future peace conference will focus on territorial matters, industrial economy, post-occupation policies, and reparations issues. The newspaper described the US position on the above issues as follows: In terms of territory, it focuses on the Ryukyu Islands (including the Greater Ryukyu Island). The United States hopes that the peace conference will reach an agreement on the US strategic trusteeship of the Ryukyu Islands, but it seems that it has not yet been decided whether it will be a partial or total trusteeship. In terms of industrial economy, the United States plans to include clauses in the peace treaty allowing Japan's economic activities and maintaining industrial standards so that Japan's productivity and industrial talent can be fully utilized. At the same time, it restricts its expansion and development direction to avoid becoming a potential military threat. In terms of post-occupation policy, the United States advocates withdrawing the occupying forces from Japan within a few months after the treaty comes into effect. The United States also believes that the Allied control over Japan after the treaty comes into effect should be carried out under the guidance of the United States. Since the United Nations cannot immediately assume supervisory responsibility, the United States suggests that various countries form their own organizations to implement supervision and control during the transition period. In terms of reparations, the United States does not object to providing assets that are easy to distribute, such as machine tools, for reparations, but opposes the large-scale dismantling of Japanese factories. The Monitor did not mention the veto power, but said: The United States believes that the procedures adopted by the peace conference should "not allow any major power to unilaterally obstruct the agreement."</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Engage in Barter Trade with China, the Soviet Union, and Other Countries After Representatives of Various Countries Arrive in Japan, Suggestions Will Be Put Forward</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] According to Jiji News Agency: According to the Japanese Trade Agency's large-scale barter trade plan, Japan hopes to import 30,000 tons of open-cut coal from China every month in exchange for 20 Japanese locomotives. The barter trade plan includes China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Sweden, and the Philippines. In addition to hoping to import coal from China, Japan also wants to import iron ore from the Northeast in exchange for locomotives, rails, and other items. Japan has currently requested headquarters to exchange agricultural tools made in Japan for soybeans from the Northeast. The Trade Agency's plan intends to exchange Japanese-made wooden boats for Chinese sugar and cloth. According to the current plan for international trade, the medium of exchange is the US dollar. Japanese business people believe that this is very unfavorable to both China and Japan, and the currencies of both countries are considered "unstable." Although the movement to set an exchange rate between the United States and Japan as soon as possible has been heard, it is feared that it will not be possible to set it in time for this plan. Also, regarding the barter trade between Japan and the Soviet Union, Japan will import 110,000 tons of coal and 100,000 tons of coke by the end of this year. Currently, 1,400 tons of coke have been imported. In addition, the Soviet Union will import 20,000 cubic feet of timber to Japan this year in exchange for 295 Japanese-made wooden boats. The Soviet Union also hopes to obtain machinery worth 500 million yen from Japan, mainly textile machines, zinc, iron plates, and fishing nets. Japan originally intended to supply France with textiles and chemicals in exchange for raw materials from Vietnam, but due to the current chaos in Luan and Vietnam, this goal may be difficult to achieve. The above trade plans are still under discussion, and the purpose is that Japan can put forward concrete suggestions when senior foreign representatives come to Japan. The plan also intends to export magnesium and other light metals to the Philippines in exchange for iron ore and scrap metal. Sweden intends to exchange iron shafts for Japanese textiles.</p>
<h3>Beijing Municipal Council Passes Resolution Opposing Opening Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Beijing Municipal Council passed a temporary motion by Sun Yulin and others on the 27th, opposing opening trade with Japan. The motion put forward two reasons: (1) Because the Allied peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, according to international practice, it is not possible to trade. (2) China has suffered a lot from the destruction of industry and commerce by the Japanese during the eight-year war of resistance. At this time, we should seek gradual recovery, and how can we endure being exploited by them again? Currently, various industrial and commercial organizations in Shanghai and resident members of the Political Participation Council have protested to the government one after another. The council will also express something on behalf of the million citizens of the capital.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Returning to Xiamen from the Philippines are Extorted Along the Way</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 27th] It is learned that the overseas Chinese who returned to Xiamen from the Philippines on the Zhibade (Chepstow) Wheel were repeatedly extorted by many Filipino detectives when boarding the ship in Manila, and a lot of gold ornaments and silver items were looted. On the wheel, they were treated harshly by the crew. When they arrived in Xiamen, they were harassed by Qinghai Customs officials on the pretext of imposing exorbitant taxes of dozens to hundreds of Philippine pesos on each piece of luggage. This kind of behavior not only violates the government's intention to protect overseas Chinese, but is also illegal.</p>
<h3>Fujian Registers Returning Overseas Chinese from Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 27th] Regarding the matter of sending back overseas Chinese from Vietnam, the Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Office recently received a telegram from the Hong Kong Joint Federation of Overseas Chinese Affairs Office that overseas Chinese from Ximaidi'an (Cho Lon) and Hanoi, which belong to Vietnam, are all on the list of those to be sent back. However, due to special circumstances in Haiphong, it will not be sent back for the time being. The Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Office will handle the registration immediately.</p>
<h3>Administrative Yuan Sends Planes to Kunming to Transport Refugees Back to Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 27th] The Executive Yuan specially dispatched two special planes, Nos. 530 and 540, to Kunming to pick up refugees who had returned to China from Vietnam and were stranded in Kunming. Plane No. 530 carried 21 refugees from Guangxi, and plane No. 540 carried 54 refugees from Guangdong. They flew to Liuzhou and Guangzhou in the morning and afternoon of the 27th. The Guangdong and Guangxi Fellow Association specially presented each person with 15,000 yuan before departure.</p>
<h3>Beijing Press Conference Requests Stipulations on Reporter Identity</h3>
<p>The whole country's industry unanimously advocates</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] The articles of association of the Beijing News Reporters Association stipulate that the qualifications of members are based on the spirit of Article 1 of the News Reporters Law promulgated by the National Government on February 15, 1943. Therefore, since its establishment on September 1, 1946, the association has strictly reviewed the membership of members in accordance with the articles of association, adopting the position of "寧缺勿濫" (better to have vacancies than to accept unqualified people) and raising the status of news reporters. Recently, with the implementation of constitutional government imminent and various elections being held one after another, news reporters are an important component of free professional groups. In various elections, such as representatives to the National Assembly and legislators, the number of votes nationwide is calculated comprehensively. If there is no clear, reasonable, and fair standard for the identity of news reporters, then the election results will be far from fair, and the foundation of democratic constitutional government will not be established. The Beijing Reporters Association is aware of this. At a recent joint meeting of directors and supervisors, a motion was passed to request the relevant authorities to declare and stipulate the identity of news reporters so that there will be a standard for the whole country to follow in order to avoid and ensure fairness. In addition to submitting separate reports to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Nanjing Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Election General Office, the association also telegraphed the whole country's industry to seek unanimous advocacy.</p>

<h3>A Goat Leading the Way: A Record of the Establishment of the "Citizen Governance Promotion Association"</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent in Beiping, Zhang Jianmei</p>
<p>(1) Growth</p>
<p>"The Citizen Governance Promotion Association created by the cultural circles of Tianjin was established on July 19." The Chinese Municipal Engineering Society specially wrote a congratulatory message for the establishment of the Citizen Governance Promotion Association, saying: "Authoritative progressive and enlightened people in the academic community are no longer silent, and they will use "wisdom" and "truth" to promote the democratic politics of the city, so that it can have a demonstrative effect and establish a belief in the inevitable success of the national civil governance in the future. It is said that it is a major event in the north and also a major event in the whole country."</p>
<p>This is indeed a major event in the north and even the whole country. Hu Shi, who has been called one of the main midwives of Chinese new culture for nearly 30 years, just returned to China last year, and foreign news agencies sent telegrams one after another saying that he was going to form a new party, but Hu Shi denied it. It was not until today, a year later, that we saw the birth of a political group led by Hu Shi that started with local politics - it is the "Citizen Governance" Promotion Association. Judging from the name of the association, it should be a purely local and low-key political group, and it is just as good as the local autonomy promotion associations in various places. On the other hand, judging from Hu Shi's position in the current political society and its planned strong lineup in the cultural circles, there will be a sense of the extraordinary.</p>
<p>The "Citizen Governance" Promotion Association, after months of preparation under the guidance of Hu Shi and with the assistance of core figures such as Zhang Foquan, Cui Yiqin, and Yan Renying, was finally born on the afternoon of July 19. A couplet in the venue of the establishment meeting: "Seek democracy through democratic means," "Practice autonomy starting from the city," explained their主張 (主張). The hall was filled with more than a hundred people, all professors, industrialists, doctors, and youth association leaders. Except for Wu Bingxun, director of the Beiping Municipal Engineering Bureau, who attended as a member, no party, government, or military dignitaries participated, nor was there any officialdom that is typically seen at the establishment meeting of general public groups. Only eight or nine Chinese and foreign reporters were present. The presidents of the three universities that had a marriage in the Southwest Associated University, Hu Shi, Zhang Boling, and Mei Yiqi, served as the presidium. The Beiping Broadcasting Station and the China Electric Factory did not let go of this historically significant scene. The former sent people to record the past, and the speech of Chairman Hu Shi was broadcast nationwide that night; the latter sent staff to the venue to shoot a new opening film. The entire meeting process was conducted under the golden brilliance of four large mercury lamps.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and Motivation</p>
<p>"Our Citizen Governance Promotion Association is neither a local political party nor a national political party." Hu Shi, the chairman of the大会 and leader of the association, wearing a summer gown, waving a folding fan, and explaining the nature of the association in a relaxed way. "It's just an amateur gathering of citizens with jobs—our职业 (職業) [occupation] is so hard-earned that it's hard to even maintain a living as a teacher or civil servant. It's a profession that is by no means worth exaggerating—we want to gather together from time to time to participate in local public welfare undertakings, to help people develop an interest in civic governance, and to train ourselves to do a little work to promote local civic governance in a fair, open, and democratic way."</p>
<p>"Now is the time!" "We should unite and express our opinions on politics." Zhang Boling, an old man in his sixties, took a train from Tianjin in the morning to participate. Like a gorilla in the forests of Africa, the giant of education described a great awakening in recent decades in heavy words: "If you don't care about politics, politics will destroy you. I used to think that as long as we do a good job in education, we can save the country; but because political turmoil is uncertain, the little results of our hard work in education have been destroyed by turbulent politics. Now everyone has this awareness. Enthusiastic participation in this meeting proves that now is indeed the time for us to care about politics." The old man who has been in education for forty-nine years also denied that this is a party, "We are not for forming a party, but for the people of the whole country, and we have nothing to do with high officials and political parties."</p>
<p>"We must shoulder the responsibility of a goat and lead the people"! Li Zhuchen, general manager of Jiuda Flour Company, member of the Political Consultative Conference, and president of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, who had just returned from Beijing and Shanghai to petition for industry and commerce in the north, was also invited to speak. "When I went to the Northwest, I often saw groups of sheep, always led by goats. Today, everyone present is a leader. Everyone can lead dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of people. If we come together, like goats, and practically lead the people, we will definitely change this society." [Sentence is incomplete and grammatically incorrect in the original text.] Li Zhuchen is a practical family [sic] and will do great things.</p>
<p>Li Zhuchen: General Manager of Jiuda.</p>
<p>Zhu [Blank]: The person in charge of Tianjin Renli Woolen Company.</p>
<p>Chen Bingru: General Manager of Tianjin Chunguang Flour Company.</p>
<p>Zhu Yangqing: General Manager of Dongya Woolen Spinning Company.</p>
<p>Chang Wenxi: General Manager of the Beiping Branch of the Bank of China.</p>
<p>Wang Shiwen: A coal magnate in the north, Wang Zhengting's younger brother.</p>
<p>Yang Tianshou: Member of the China Agriculture and Industry Bank.</p>
<p>Chen Xisan: Deputy Manager of Dongya Woolen Textile Factory.</p>
<p>Ren Keyi: Director and former Secretary-General of Yongli.</p>
<p>There are three doctors, one is Guan Songtao, the most famous brain surgeon in Beiping, one is Zhong Hui, the most famous internist, who is currently the president of the Doctors' Association. Bian Wannian is also a famous doctor in Tianjin.</p>
<p>There are two people in the press, one is Liu Huoxuan, former professor of the Journalism Department of Yanjing University and current president of Tianjin Yishi Daily. The other is Yan Renying, nicknamed "Sea Monster," famous in the sports world, a descendant of the Yan Fanxun family in Tianjin, a Nankai student, and current deputy manager of the Tianjin edition of Dagong Bao.</p>
<p>People from the Christian Youth Association, such as Prince Wen's wife, are in charge of the Beiping Women's Youth Association. In fact, many people are inseparable from the Youth Association, such as Chen Xisan, the deputy manager of Dongya Woolen Textile Company, who is also in charge of the Tianjin Youth Association. ...... As for Prince Wen, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>The only official government official is Tan Bingxun. He is a food expert, in charge of the rear during the war, and is currently the director of the Beiping Municipal Engineering Bureau.</p>
<p>Zhang Foquan, a professor of political science at Peking University and the promoter of the "Citizen Governance" Promotion Association, also explained to reporters that "Citizen Governance" is neither a party organization nor a political organization, although what is discussed are political issues. "Most of our work focuses on the meaning of education."</p>
<p>(3) Theory and Work</p>
<p>"Practice autonomy starting from the city," this is the basic advocacy of the Civic Governance Promotion Association. They said that if they believe that the intellectual level of the people in the Chinese countryside is too low, the population distribution is too scattered, and the feudal forces are too strong, once "universal suffrage" is held and "autonomy" is implemented, I am afraid that malpractice will arise and instead make rural society go backwards; then "universal suffrage" and "autonomy" are most suitable to start from the city. Convenient transportation, concentrated population, concentrated wealth, popular education, and advanced and powerful arguments are all superior conditions for implementing self-government. "Although the city also has its shortcomings, these can be overcome with its advantages." Hu Shi said: "For example, the mobility of the urban population is relatively large. Many people regard it as a hotel, and even those who have lived in Beiping for generations still print their ancestral home on their business cards and do not admit that they are people of Beiping, and they are not concerned about the municipal administration of Beiping." Then Hu said: "Although I am a Xiren from Anhui, I have lived in Beiping for a long time and am willing to be a citizen of Beiping and participate in Beiping's public affairs."</p>
<p>Based on these theories, the "Citizen Governance" Association has set several fairly low-key work goals:</p>
<p>First, investigate and record the living conditions of the city, municipal facilities, and the actual situation of civic elections.</p>
<p>Second, research: invite experts to jointly study municipal problems, hoping that the research results can come up with a draft of a "Municipal Autonomy Law" or a "Municipal Charter" for national discussion. In addition, the city's education, city election law, city administrative organization, and various problems and regulations related to civic governance will be studied.</p>
<p>Third, discussion: often hold lectures and discussion meetings on municipal administration and citizens' rights and obligations, and provide the conclusions of the discussion to the city council as laws or suggest that the city government implement them.</p>
<p>Fourth, learning and training: I hope to do my best to encourage ourselves and fellow citizens to fully participate in various elections.</p>
<p>In addition, Article 17 of the brief also has the following task: "Promote the increase of the number of urban representatives in the proportion of various elections in the central and provincial counties."</p>
<p>(4) Organization and Lineup</p>
<p>The "Citizen Governance" General Assembly is temporarily located in Beiping, and the work will first start from the cities of Beiping and Tianjin, but Tianjin has no plans to establish a separate branch.</p>
<p>This association has two types of members, individual members and group members. The former has less than a hundred members so far, but if we use Li Zhuchen's metaphor, these are all goats, not sheep! The latter only has two groups so far: the Beiping Federation of Trade Unions and the Beiping Branch of the Chinese Municipal Engineering Society.</p>
<p>In order to understand the lineup of "Citizen Governance," let's review the goats among the goat herd—the directors and supervisors!</p>
<p>The promoters of the establishment, especially those from the Independent Review era and Zhang Boling's Nankai cadres, are the backbone.</p>
<p>Hu Shi: President of Peking University.</p>
<p>Cui Yiqin: Professor of International Relations at Peking University, a strongman of Independent Review.</p>
<p>Zhang Foquan: The spokesperson of the "Citizen Governance" Association in Beiping, and also the initiator. He was the first to introduce Lasswell to China, and also a strongman of Independent Review. During the Anti-Japanese War, he once went to the rear and is now giving an overview of political science at Peking University.</p>
<p>Wu Jingchao: A strongman of Independent Review, who later followed Weng Wenhao into officialdom and served as a counselor in the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After Weng left the Ministry of Economic Affairs, he returned to Tsinghua to teach.</p>
<p>Zhang [Blank]: Municipal engineering expert, once served as a counselor of the Executive Yuan, and is now teaching at Nankai University.</p>
<p>Chen Xujing: Dean of Nankai University.</p>
<p>Wang Yuxiu: Professor of Beiping Normal College</p>
<p>Zhang Boling: President of Nankai.</p>
<p>Li Shuhua: President of the Second Beiping Research Institute, the leader of the French faction below Li Shizeng.</p>
<p>Mei Yibao: Professor of Yenching University.</p>
<p>Huang Yusheng: Director of Nankai Training, Zhang Boling's capable cadre.</p>

<h3>US Military Police in Qingdao Stealing from Themselves; Officers and Soldiers Collude in Car Theft Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 26th] Chinese police have recently solved a case of US military police stealing cars for the first time, as a result of which more than a dozen US officers and soldiers have been detained by the US Military Police Headquarters. According to statistics from the US Military Police Headquarters, the number of stolen military vehicles recently, including Jeeps and trucks, has reached more than 200. The US military authorities believed that they were stolen and sold by Chinese people, but the Chinese security authorities and those familiar with the inside story know that 99% of them were directly stolen and sold by the US military. Many US military officers and generals privately sell their own vehicles, priced between 500 and 600 US dollars. After receiving the money, they report to the US Military Police Headquarters that the vehicle was stolen at a certain time and place, claiming it with great certainty. For example, at the Donghai Hotel, US sentries often collude with Chinese and foreigners, and after receiving a bribe of 200 US dollars, they can freely steal the car. The sentries then deceive their superiors with lies, saying that it was stolen. Although the US Navy's auto repair shop on Daping Road is heavily guarded by sentries and the entry and exit of vehicles must be inspected by the officer on duty, thefts still occur from time to time, which is because the officers and soldiers collude to steal the cars and share the money. The US Military Police Headquarters has been unable to find any clues in the investigation of these vehicle thefts for a long time. A person named Xu Liye, a resident of Jimo, residing at 75 Dengzhou Road, secretly informed Odao, the leader of the US Military Police Investigation Team, that he had learned about the vehicle theft situation, but requested a reward of 50 yuan before he could reveal it. Chinese police arrested Xu when he went to the US military to swindle 50 yuan. After interrogation, he confessed that he was introducing the sale of Jeeps and provided details of the US military colluding in car theft. He recently sold several Jeeps through the hands of Navy Babel of the US Port Command and a translator from a certain unit, each for more than 500 yuan. At this point, the US side also obtained preliminary clues and successively arrested US military criminals.</p>
<h3>Flash Flood in Xikang Province; Washed Away the Sichuan-Xikang Highway</h3>
<p>Requires 10 Billion Yuan to Repair</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ya'an, 26th] The Sichuan-Xikang Highway is an important transportation artery for border defense. The section from Ya'an to Kangding has recently suffered from thunderstorms and flash floods. All the large bridges along the road have been washed away completely. Even the small bridges were washed away with the water. The section from Lengzhuguan to Wasigou, because it is close to the Dadu River, all the roadbeds have been washed away, leaving only a remnant. This is an unprecedented loss due to flash floods. At the current price level, it will cost no less than 10 billion yuan to repair. In addition to rushing to repair, the provincial government is requesting subsidies.</p>
<h3>Disputes over Xiao Zhenying's Estate; Wang Lengqi and Others are Mediating</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] After Xiao Zhenying, the mayor of Tianjin before the Anti-Japanese War, passed away in May, disputes arose over his estate. Xiao's father, Guo Ting, recently hired a lawyer to publish a notice, warning Xiao's wife, Liu Wenying, not to handle real estate and bank property rights without authorization. Currently, Wang Lengqi and other friends of Xiao from the "July 7th" Incident are mediating, so that a lawsuit will not be filed. Xiao's father has two sons, the elder is Zhenying, and the younger is Zhenxiang, who is now a lawyer. There are fifteen houses, some land, and shares in Datong Bank. However, the land deeds are mostly in the name of Liu Wenying. Several properties in Beiping were gifted to Xiao by Song Zheyuan, but Xiao refused and his wife accepted them. Recently, Xiao's wife, fearing that her husband's brother would compete for the property, intended to sell them, which led to the dispute. Ling Changyan, the lawyer hired by Xiao's father, said: The Xiao family originally lived together. After Xiao's death, his wife served his father-in-law with coarse grains and old clothes. This old father, who is sixty or seventy years old, has been humiliated by his daughter-in-law, and Xiao's brother has also been treated unfairly. In anger, he chose to live in Tianjin. Xiao's wife agreed to pay 3 million yuan per month for living expenses, but because Xiao's father and brother wanted more, she did not agree, and the dispute gradually accumulated.</p>

<h3>Editorial: China's Compromise</h3>
<p>Our country's response to the United States' proposal to convene a preliminary conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty was formally sent to Washington yesterday. There are three main points: (1) China agrees to participate in the eleven-nation preliminary conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty; however, it hopes that before the conference is held, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will hold an informal four-nation foreign ministers' conference to thoroughly exchange views on various issues related to the Japanese Peace Treaty; (2) China agrees that the preliminary conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty should adopt a two-thirds majority voting system, but hopes that this two-thirds must include China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; (3) China hopes that the formal conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty can be held in Shanghai. This response can be said to be a compromise between the US proposal and the Soviet counter-proposal. If both the US and the Soviet Union have sincerity in concluding the Japanese Peace Treaty as soon as possible, then accepting China's compromise will not be difficult to break the current deadlock in the US-Soviet dispute.</p>
<p>The US proposal was put forward to the relevant governments in the Far East on the 16th of this month, advocating that a preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty be convened in Washington on August 19 to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty; any resolution can be established as long as it is approved by a two-thirds majority. The sole purpose of the United States in convening a preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty outside the scope of the Far Eastern Commission is to avoid the Soviet Union exercising its veto power in the meeting from time to time, and to accelerate the drafting of the Japanese Peace Treaty. Because US Secretary of State Marshall began to consider how to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty after returning to the country from Moscow. At the same time, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo General MacArthur has repeatedly appealed to the Allied countries, asking them to speed up the drafting of the Japanese Peace Treaty. Therefore, the US government recently made this proposal. In theory, any country that hopes to see the Japanese Peace Treaty concluded successfully as soon as possible will naturally not express objections to the US proposal; however, the Soviet Union, which stands in opposition to the United States everywhere, naturally cannot express its approval of the proposal suddenly put forward by the United States. The Soviet Union's response was published on the 23rd. In addition to rejecting the US invitation to participate in the preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty, it put forward a counter-proposal: advocating that a four-nation foreign ministers' meeting of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union be convened first to draft the Japanese Peace Treaty, and then the draft of the Japanese Peace Treaty be submitted to the Far Eastern Committee for discussion. As for the date of the foreign ministers' meeting, it should be decided by the US authorities in consultation with the ambassadors of China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The sole purpose of the Soviet Union in advocating that the procedure for drafting the Japanese Peace Treaty should be the same as the procedure for drafting the peace treaties of the five countries of Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, and firmly demanding that it be conducted within the scope of the Far Eastern Commission, is to retain its privilege of exercising its veto power, in order to enhance its importance in drafting the Japanese Peace Treaty.</p>
<p>Therefore, the US proposal and the Soviet counter-proposal have their own effects and their own merits and demerits, and it is difficult to have hope for compromise. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on the 26th, the US government will disregard the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty and will directly preside over the convening of the preliminary meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty. If this report becomes a reality, then the US and the Soviet Union will also go their separate ways in the Far East. The formation of this situation, no matter from which angle it is observed, is ultimately the misfortune of the Far East. The final result will only benefit the defeated country; and the first to suffer will be our China. Therefore, China, located between the two major forces of the United States and the Soviet Union, should do its best to reconcile the two countries, especially at this critical moment when the two countries are dividing and merging, it is even more necessary to act as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union. This time, China's compromise contains this major role. We only hope that the politicians and diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union will broaden their horizons, not haggle over their own interests, but plan more for the long-term peace of the Far East and quickly accept the compromise put forward by our country.</p>
<p>In the past, we cannot deny that China has failed to fully play the role of a "bridge" between the United States and the Soviet Union like France; at the same time, we cannot deny that the United States has also failed to respect our country's valuable opinions as much as it respects France; therefore, the countries concerned in the Far East, especially China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, should all reflect on themselves for the evolution of the Far Eastern situation to this point. The crisis in the Far East is deepening day by day. If we do not plan early to eliminate it in the invisible, then the Far East will still inevitably become a source of world turmoil in the future, which is even more serious than the situation in Europe. Therefore, China's policy towards Japan, whether it is trade with Japan, compensation, or peace treaties, should be carefully studied. The Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council decided yesterday to establish a Japanese Policy Committee, which is a very meaningful thing; at the same time, we also hope that the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries can also attach special importance to our opinions.</p>
<h3>National Food Conference</h3>
<p>The National Food Conference opened in the capital yesterday. Gathering the heads of various provinces together to decide on future food plans is of profound significance. Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to food administration and came to give a training in person at the opening, which was especially inspiring. Our country has always been based on agriculture. In recent years, the countryside has declined and agricultural affairs have been abandoned. Even the grain produced is often insufficient. At the convening of this National Food Conference, I would like to briefly present my views.</p>
<p>First, the area of cultivated land in our country is tending to decrease day by day, so there is insufficient grain production. In the past, food imports became a major input. We should actively increase food production and expand the area of cultivated land, so that we can achieve food self-sufficiency. Second, the country is now mobilizing to quell the rebellion, and the country has entered a wartime system. Grain is related to military needs and should be supplied without shortage. Third, requisitioning and borrowing is a necessary means to ensure that military needs are met, but abuses are easily caused during implementation. All responsible personnel should do their best to prevent abuses from occurring. According to news reports, the Chairman pointed out in his training that some provinces collect land taxes on a contract basis, resulting in large households not paying grain, while poor farmers bear a heavy burden. This phenomenon is particularly unreasonable and should be corrected quickly. Furthermore, the national grain production should be shared, so that the distribution of food can be reasonable.</p>
<p>We cannot fail to point out here that there have been quite a few disasters in various places this year. The floods in Guangdong and Guangxi have caused particularly heavy losses to the people. For these areas, land taxes should be reduced or exempted as appropriate, so that the people can live in peace. The delegates to the food conference come from various provinces and must be well aware of the hardships of the people in each province. During this mobilization period, food is a major national policy. We should take both national interests and people's livelihoods into consideration, so that the country's resources will not be depleted and the people's hardships will not be deepened. We express our respect for the hard work of the representatives who came to Beijing to attend this conference in the summer heat. We wish the representatives a healthy stay and the success of the conference.</p>
<h3>Bumper Harvest of New Grain in Northern Jiangsu; Only 70,000 Yuan per Shi; Rice Price in Zhenjiang Falls to 240,000</h3>

<h3>US Concerned About Indonesian-Dutch War: Secretary Marshall Considers Timely Action; Indonesia Urges Australia to Mediate</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 27th] According to well-informed sources on the 27th, Secretary of State Marshall is personally deeply concerned about the Indonesian situation in order to determine whether the United States can take action to stop the Indonesian-Dutch conflict. Marshall is currently under pressure from influential figures overseas and domestically, including some officials here, to take some steps, such as acting as an arbitrator or proposing that the matter be handled by the United Nations.</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources, this effort alone is not enough to move Marshall, but the political situation in Asia, and even the fate of the European Recovery Program, are to some extent related to this decision. Therefore, they feel that the possibility of the United States taking action has greatly increased. Most officials here are very hopeful to clarify to the world that resolving political issues with violence, as practiced in Asia, is not in the interest of any party that adopts this method. According to US officials, this attitude towards Indonesia is not only based on humanitarian and philosophical grounds, because they also hope to advise the Koreans not to resort to violence in their hope of achieving complete independence and autonomy.</p>
<p>Another point that the Indonesian situation influences some of Marshall's advisors is that, in their opinion, the use of violence is a bad example when the Western world is trying to show that its way of solving human problems is superior to the Soviet communist system. On the other hand, some officials in the government here insist that the peaceful end of the long-term political dispute in Indonesia would also benefit Marshall's European Recovery Program, as this would allow Indonesia to resume exporting rare materials such as rubber, tin, oil, vegetable fat, pepper, and quinine. They say that these products are the most valuable contribution to the recovery of Europe, and it is sufficient to show that the Netherlands occupies an important position in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] Indonesian Republic's chief diplomatic representative to Australia, Mr. Toussaint, said that Australian Prime Minister Chifley has received a telegram from the Indonesian Republic requesting his mediation and is sincerely considering the whole issue.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] Authoritative sources say that Australia is "considering" requesting the United Nations to intervene in the Indonesian-Dutch war. British officials said that Australian officials had informed the British Foreign Office of this intention, but there is apparently no concrete decision yet. A spokesman for the Australian delegation said that the country is currently maintaining close contact with British officials in London and emphasized that Australia is deeply concerned about the Indonesian war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] The chairman of the American Indian League, Singh, today sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie, asking him to bring the Indonesian issue to the Security Council. He pointed out that the Netherlands' use of force is a destruction of peace and will be despised by all people engaged in the struggle for independence.</p>
<h3>Main Forces of Indonesian and Dutch Armies Make Contact</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 27th] Dutch military reports today indicate that Dutch troops advancing along western Java have made contact with the main forces of the Indonesian army. The Dutch army admitted encountering resistance in some locations, but made smooth progress in most locations. The 150-mile stretch between Batavia and Cirebon has been cleared, implying that eastern Java is now firmly in Dutch hands. The Dutch army has also established local maintenance committees in the occupied areas. Whether to advance south from Semarang to attack the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, remains to be decided.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: Indonesian military sources say that the Indonesian Republican Army has captured Medan, the largest city in Sumatra, and cut off the road between the city and the Dutch port of Belawan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 27th] A Dutch military communiqué announced today that it had occupied the small port of Tegal, 50 miles west of Cirebon on the north coast of Java. The Dutch army advanced 10 miles from Lawang in eastern Java and rescued a large number of Chinese who had been detained by the Republic in Singosari. The Dutch army also occupied Prabuhan Ratu in Wonokoyo Bay and the Lamajang power plant, 20 miles south of Bandung. When the Dutch army attacked the Genuk Sari area of Semarang, the Republican army used women as "shields." The Dutch military communiqué denied that Medan had been captured by the Indonesian army.</p>
<h3>Indonesia Adopts Scorched Earth Policy; Losses of Overseas Chinese are Incalculable; Chiang Chia-tung Asks Indonesia to Stop Atrocities</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 27th] Our Consul-General in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, broadcast last night, appealing to the responsible leaders of the Indonesian government and army to stop the harm to the lives and property of our overseas Chinese. He said that the atrocities of irresponsible elements in the Indonesian army will damage the reputation of the Indonesian Republic in the international community. It is the responsibility of the leaders of the Republic to prevent the slaughter, looting, and burning of neutral third parties, so as not to lose international sympathy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 27th] The Chinese Consulate-General in Batavia has sent a team to the front line to investigate the losses of overseas Chinese. Consul-General Chiang Chia-tung recently inspected the Dutch-occupied valleys and found that the Indonesian army had set fire to hundreds of Chinese houses when retreating. According to Mr. Bouwer, the editor-in-chief of the Dutch newspaper in Batavia, the total number of overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra is about one million, with property losses amounting to millions of dollars, and many deaths. "Thousands of people have become homeless and are begging for a living overnight."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 26th] Observers are gradually suspecting whether the Indonesian Republic is fighting the Dutch army or the unarmed overseas Chinese. As the war gradually unfolds, it becomes increasingly obvious that the overseas Chinese are in a dilemma and have no place to stand. The Dutch army has only suffered less than a hundred deaths so far, and the Indonesian side has suffered even fewer casualties, but it is generally believed that the overseas Chinese are likely to suffer the most casualties when the war ends. In terms of property, the overseas Chinese, who are so-called third-party allies, have suffered the most losses. Observers and overseas Chinese alike believe that the Dutch and Indonesian governments and the Indonesian Republic cannot prevent soldiers from both sides from engaging in destruction, arson, and looting. This is the scorched earth tactic adopted by the Indonesian side before the Dutch army arrived, and the Dutch army cannot quickly enter the areas evacuated by the Indonesian army to reduce the losses of the overseas Chinese. Observers also expressed their heartache at the Chinese government's silence on this matter. They constantly hope that the Chinese government can issue a strong written warning to both authorities, especially the Indonesian Republic, or issue such a warning in a broadcast. People here unanimously believe that the tragic experiences of the overseas Chinese here should be reported to the world, or at least notify former Prime Minister Shahrir, who is currently on a mission for the Indonesian government in Calcutta.</p>
<h3>Dutch Government Allocates Funds to Aid Refugees</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 27th] The Dutch government has allocated 1 million guilders to be used to aid refugees in the war zone. The chairman of the Chinese General Association will be responsible for distributing this aid. In addition, our Consul-General has also generously donated 80,000 guilders to aid overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>British Parliamentarians Plan to Ask Government to Guarantee No Aid to the Netherlands</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] It is learned that British Labour Party members will raise a number of questions at a meeting of the House of Commons on the 30th of this month, asking the government to provide guarantees that it will not assist the Netherlands in fighting Indonesia. Labour Party member Mr. Driberg will ask Foreign Secretary Bevin to guarantee that Britain will not supply the Netherlands with weapons and equipment, and another Labour Party member will ask Colonial Secretary Jones to guarantee that Britain will not provide the Netherlands with facilities in Singapore. He will also ask the Naval Minister when Britain will hand over the aircraft carrier "Majestic" to the Netherlands, and whether it is still planned to transfer it.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] The London Times published an article today commenting on the conflict in Indonesia, reiterating its call for a settlement through mediation. The article stated that the United Kingdom and France are trying to guide the torrent of Asian nationalism into peaceful waterways. The recent actions taken by the Netherlands in Indonesia inevitably make the United Kingdom and France feel embarrassed. No matter how serious the damage caused by the Indonesian Republic's resistance to the Netherlands is, the consequences of the Netherlands taking unexpected actions will be even more serious. The scope of the current military operations is gradually expanding, and there is already a tendency for the two countries to be at war. If we want to avoid irreparable damage to the relationship between Europe and Asia, then these military operations must be brought to an end.</p>
<h3>Nationwide Holiday in Burma to Mourn Fallen Leaders</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 26th] Burma held a nationwide work stoppage and holiday today to mourn the seven fallen leaders. Memorial ceremonies and demonstrations were held throughout the country. British troops were ordered not to enter the city to prevent incidents. Burmese people flocked to the Great Hall where the bodies were laid to pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Jinnah Sternly States Determination to Support Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 26th] Pakistan Governor-General and President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, told former Indonesian Prime Minister Shahrir today that the Dutch government's disregard for arbitration, declaration of war against the Indonesian Republic, and abuse of force are not tolerated by civilized countries in the world. Pakistan considers the Dutch government's action to be an unfriendly act, intended to destroy the nascent Islamic democracy of Indonesia. I believe that any just person in any freedom-loving country cannot agree with the Dutch government's unreasonable actions, and democratic people in Britain and the United States will especially express indignation. The one million Muslims in India are determined to support the Indonesian Republic's war of resistance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 6th] Former Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Shahrir told the Indian Constituent Assembly today that the war in Java is a challenge to the whole world, especially Asian countries. Indonesians should continue to fight with all their strength, but from a military point of view, Indonesia really has little strength. What they face is 100,000 well-equipped Dutch troops.</p>

<h3>Australia Seeks Important Speaking Rights at Japanese Peace Conference; Evatt Wants to Obtain This Guarantee from MacArthur</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 27th] The significance of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's trip to Japan has become clear today. Mr. Evatt's trip is to inform MacArthur of Australia's mission in the Japanese peace conference, which should be second only to the United States, and not to criticize the US occupation policy. Mr. Evatt is expected to reach an agreement with MacArthur on the main issues of the Japanese peace treaty. According to Mr. Warner of the Australian delegation, the idea that Mr. Evatt and MacArthur are "arguing" must be rejected. Mr. Evatt is willing to obtain behind-the-scenes information. More importantly, his visit to Japan is to obtain a guarantee that the United States and Australia will jointly have the initiative in the Japanese peace treaty. Mr. Evatt believes that Australia should not be regarded as a secondary small country. In terms of the Japanese peace treaty, Australia should be a Pacific power second only to the United States.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 26th] The local radio station has just issued a message: The head of the Canadian delegation to Japan, at the invitation of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo, MacArthur, has set off for Japan tonight.</p>
<h3>Australia Strictly Limits Imports of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley announced that after the opening of trade with Japan, the items imported from Japan to Australia will be limited to main items that are not owned by Australia. As for items such as toys and ceramics, their import will be strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Releases Occupation Report: Communist Party of Japan Has Weak Influence</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 27th] MacArthur released his April occupation report on the 27th, pointing out that the Japanese Communist Party has less than 4% of the seats in the House of Representatives, and the Japanese people supported the "moderate line" in the various elections in April. The report also said that, according to Japanese statistics, the number of votes for communist candidates for governor in each state and county accounted for 1% of the total, and more than 70% of the total number of voters voted in the general election of members of the House of Representatives. According to observations by the Allied forces, there was less harassment during this election than last year. Local committees in Japan have purchased the first batch of farmland from large landowners to redistribute to tenants. The economic dynamics in all aspects of Japan have become more active, mainly because the allocation of coal has improved, but the future food panic is still a serious problem.</p>
<h3>Hidden Materials in Japan Worth Billions of Yen</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Mr. Hinko, a key figure in the recent "Sego Incident" in Japan, told reporters on the 27th: "Whether this incident is related to the cabinet ministers of the current cabinet, there will be a day when the truth comes out. However, during the Yoshino cabinet era, it was publicly announced that there were no hidden materials. Today, I am accusing Yu, who was responsible for the investigation, which is unexpected. According to the investigation at that time, there were thirteen military locations in the Japanese mainland, each with at least nearly 300 million yen of materials destroyed by soldiers and bureaucrats, and more than 150 letters of complaints and reports have been received. I am determined to submit all these materials to the Special Investigation Committee on Hidden Materials of the National Assembly, in order to clarify the truth."</p>
<h3>Assassination of Korean Leftist Leader; Murderer Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Seoul, 16th] A 19-year-old Korean youth, Han Jae-neung (transliteration), has confessed to being the murderer of Liu Wen-yang (transliteration), the anti-communist leftist leader who was assassinated in Seoul on July 18. Han Jae-neung recently came to South Korea from the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal Transferred to Minister of Defense; Truman Signs the Army-Navy-Air Force Merger Bill</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] President Truman signed the Army-Navy-Air Force merger bill today, transferring Secretary of the Navy Forrestal to Minister of Defense, and issuing an executive order stipulating the powers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force departments of the Ministry of Defense. Truman had already learned that his old mother was getting old and frail and was about to die, and he urgently needed to return to his hometown to visit her. Because of the signing of this bill, he delayed his departure by 17 minutes. The reason why the President was eager to sign it was said to be to have the Senate approve Forrestal's appointment as Minister of Defense before the summer recess.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] President Truman today recommended Forrestal to the Senate as Minister of Defense. Mr. Forrestal is 55 years old. He served as Undersecretary of the Navy from 1940 to 1944, and as Secretary of the Navy from 1944 to the present. He is the only remaining figure in the Roosevelt cabinet.</p>
<h3>US Congress Adjourns; Reopens in Early January</h3>
<p>Congress and the Government Can Still Cooperate</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The first session of the 80th US Congress ended today. There are very few major legislative bills that have been passed. Many major international and domestic issues, most notably the Marshall Plan, have not been resolved. According to members of Congress, whether or not they will be called to Washington for a special session during the recess to discuss the European Recovery Program, the first thing to be discussed at the beginning of the second session in early January next year will be a large-scale foreign aid plan that requires huge expenditures. In this session of Congress, although the Republican Party has a majority advantage for the first time in fifteen years, the conflict between Congress and the Democratic government is not as serious as generally expected. In foreign affairs, the State Department has quickly put forward many policies and passed them by Congress, including the 400 million yuan aid to Greece and Turkey under the Truman Doctrine, the 350 million yuan relief to war-torn countries in Europe and Asia, and the treaties with the former Axis satellite countries drafted by former Secretary of State Byrnes. On the domestic front, Truman has won the battle with the Republicans over the reduction of personal income tax, and the tax cut bill was finally vetoed by the President. However, the President's veto was overturned by both houses of Congress on the bill to restrict the activities of trade unions. When Congress adjourned yesterday, there were still some bills supported by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, such as raising the limit on the entry of exiled people, which were still in the committee stage, and it is expected that there will still be many difficulties when the discussions continue in January next year. Republican members of Congress, while preparing to return home, have all stated that before civilians in the United States receive a reduction in income tax expenditures, relief to Europe cannot be approved. Reducing income tax is one of the slogans of the Republican campaign, so it is expected that the foreign aid plan, which requires huge expenditures, will be difficult to pass smoothly when the second session of Congress reconvenes next year.</p>
<h3>US Congress Passes Foreign Aid Funds</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] A bill on the United States' aid to foreign countries with 165.7 million yuan was approved by the Congressional Mixed Committee yesterday, and was returned to President Truman for signature by the Senate today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The House of Representatives today passed the funds needed for the government's foreign aid plan, totaling 1.657 billion US dollars, which is 256 million US dollars less than the amount requested by President Truman, including 400 million yuan for aid to Greece and Turkey, 332 million yuan for relief to war-torn countries, 600 million yuan for military administrative expenses and relief in occupied areas, and 73.33614 million US dollars for international refugee organizations and other expenses.</p>
<h3>US Senate to Form Committee to Visit Europe</h3>
<p>In Order to Implement Secretary Marshall's Aid to Europe Plan</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] The US Senate Appropriations Committee held a special meeting today to discuss whether it is possible to send a committee to Europe to study the European needs for the implementation of the Marshall Aid to Europe Plan. Republican Senator Bridges declared that the United States' participation in the Aid to Europe Plan is a very important decision. It is expected that the Senate will soon announce the establishment of the above-mentioned committee, with Bridges as chairman and Senate Republican leader Wiley also as one of the representatives.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] The US Senate today authorized the Legal Committee to investigate the issue of refugees in Europe, in order to amend the current US immigration laws. The committee will first discuss the draft bill proposed by Stratton to allow 400,000 refugees to enter the country within four years, and the recommendations that the United States will accept according to the International Refugee Organization, and then prepare a report to be submitted to the next session of Congress for discussion.</p>
<h3>President Truman's Mother Dies; President Rushes Back to Hometown; Bad News Arrives En Route</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 26th] President Truman's mother passed away at her home in Grandview, Missouri, at 5:30 pm Standard Time on the 26th, at the age of 94. The President had already rushed from Washington by special plane. He received a radio message in the plane that his mother had passed away. The old lady fell and injured her hip in February, and her condition worsened in May. The old lady was deeply loved by the American people. After her son succeeded as President, she only went to the White House once in May 1945. She was usually indifferent to fame and fortune and did not pursue luxury because of her son's prominence. She lived in a wooden house in Grandview, Missouri, in her later years. The old lady came from a prominent family. She was the daughter of a farmer in Western Seaport Station, Missouri, and there were nine brothers and sisters. Her property was completely destroyed during the Civil War. Later, she married a neighboring farmer and gave birth to a son, Truman. It is said that the President, from his childhood apprenticeship in a chemical store to the present day, often consulted his mother when he needed to make decisions. When major events occurred, the President always informed his mother by telephone from the White House first. The old lady knew about the surrender of Germany and Japan before it happened. The old lady's name was Martha, and she was born in Western Seaport Station, Missouri. There were nine siblings. Although the old lady was old, she was energetic. She fractured her hip in a fall on February 13 this year, and her illness recurred in May. Her condition was once critical, and the President attended to her bedside for 12 days, but it improved again. According to the old lady's doctor, Dr. Green, the old lady had been in a coma since last night, so he informed the President by telephone today that she might not be able to get through tonight. The President immediately rushed back after receiving the news, but it was too late. When the old lady went to Washington in May 1945, she was deeply disturbed to see a large number of officials, diplomats, and army and navy generals waiting at the airport. She said on the spot, "If I had known about such a scene, I would never have come here." She never went to the White House again afterward. When the old lady lived in Grandview, her daughter, Miss Mancey, was with her. The President served his mother from childhood until he grew up, and still often learned from her. Therefore, biographers have called the old lady the leading force in President Truman's life.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Grandview, Missouri, 26th] It is learned that the funeral of President Truman's mother is scheduled to be held at 3:00 pm on the 28th in the wooden house where she lived.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The House of Representatives today passed a resolution expressing condolences for the death of President Truman's mother, and all members stood up and remained silent in mourning. Senator Barkley announced the bad news in the Senate, praising the old lady as one of the finest figures in American history and a typical mother. It is especially commendable that the old lady was not proud because of her son's prominence.</p>
<h3>A Sketch of the Soviet Zone in Germany</h3>
<p>Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities in Berlin are preparing to divide Europe and Germany, making the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan more concrete. Stalin's right-hand man, Beria, has recently arrived in Berlin to complete a massive Soviet propaganda apparatus. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also preparing to draw down the "Iron Curtain," isolating the Soviet occupation zone of Germany from the outside world, as another concrete manifestation of its refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan. The Soviet Union has already established a totalitarian government there completely controlled by the German Communist Party. What follows is a combined and abridged translation of two reports from Donald, the Berlin bureau chief of the American magazine "Newsweek," and correspondent Howard, to provide a glimpse into the recent activities of the Soviet Union within Germany. - Translator</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Number 15 Weissen See Parkstrasse in the Soviet-occupied sector of Berlin is a majestic brown stone building, guarded day and night by Soviet soldiers and German police. It is a "sealed" factory, and anyone entering or leaving its doors is subject to strict searches. Inside, technical equipment such as radio facsimile telegraphs, radios, transmitters, etc., work non-stop day and night, receiving and transmitting various news items in German, Russian, and code.</p>
<p>This building is the headquarters of the Soviet Information Bureau and TASS, the former being the central organ of Soviet propaganda towards Germany, regularly supplying news to newspapers and radio stations in the Soviet occupation zone and Berlin. In addition, the postal section of the German Institute for Economic Issues is also located inside.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the Soviet Information Bureau is an organization that introduces world news to German newspapers, but in reality, this is not the case. The Soviet Information Bureau, under the guise of a news agency, regularly provides "news" to newspapers and radio stations within the Soviet occupation zone.</p>
<p>On the surface, the Soviet Information Bureau does not employ Germans, but in reality, it controls all the German staff of the German Institute for Social and Economic Issues, about two hundred people, who are nominally researchers, but in reality, are intelligence agents serving the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>These two hundred Germans have all been carefully selected and are able to convert to Soviet ideology and methods. Supervisors, nominally called "chief editors," are required to send their reports to the Moscow Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are fully responsible for the accuracy of the content of the reports. "Reporters" must adhere strictly to deadlines, and their reports must be submitted by 6:00 PM every day or sent by coded telegram. Agents in the Western-occupied zones send their intelligence through the post office to secret addresses in Berlin, which are then regularly collected by Soviet staff of the Soviet Information Bureau.</p>
<p>This Soviet propaganda apparatus, after months of preparation, has gradually established its foundation, and by the beginning of June of this year, all plans had been fully arranged. They sent out many letters, recruiting a large number of young intelligence agents, who have recently begun work. According to the head of the organization, Makarov, "The purpose of this new measure is to build a bridge between Germany and the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Indeed, this bridge has two purposes: one is to send information about Germany, Western Europe, and the Western Allies to the Moscow Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the other is to inject Soviet propaganda into Germany.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The reporter (Donald, the Berlin bureau chief of "Newsweek," referring to himself, the following will follow this format) recalling his trip to the scenic areas of Saxony and Thuringia in the German industrial area, could not help but recall his first trip to the same area in the summer of 1939.</p>
<p>The only difference between the tyranny practiced here and Hitler's tyranny lies in this: in the summer of 1939, most of the German people supported Hitler's tyrannical government; today's tyranny is launched by the Soviet occupation authorities and carried out by the German Communist Party and thousands of rebels. The people dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and everyone feels that the political atmosphere here is too suffocating. Resistance to this foreign tyranny has reignited the flames of nationalism from the Hitler era.</p>
<p>When an American car carrying American journalists arrived in a certain city in Germany, excited crowds began to gather, and in less than five minutes, more than two hundred people had gathered. Although we were escorted by six Soviet officials, we were soon surrounded by the crowd. The children, of course, wanted candy, but the adults exclaimed in unison, "When will the Americans come to save us again?"</p>
<p>Even the dullest German knows that this is impossible unless a third world war occurs, and this war may occur on the already bombed German soil. Twenty-five percent of the residents of western Germany hope that this will happen, and fifty percent believe that war is inevitable. In the Soviet occupation zone, approximately ninety percent or more of the residents seem to be hoping for the outbreak of war.</p>
<p>Only in this brief five-minute interlude were we able to smell some of the political atmosphere of the people behind the Iron Curtain. In addition, whether at meals, on visits, or on every stretch of the road in the eastern occupation zone, we were always guarded by Soviet officers. In Dresden, they did not allow us to watch the opera alone, and in Weimar, even the request to stroll down the street for an hour was rejected.</p>
<p>We visited several prominent German figures, all of whom were Communists. One elderly theology professor, Hickmann, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union in Saxony, questioned the "freedom" of the Free German Youth League. A Soviet officer standing next to him immediately gave him a stern look, and the old professor fell silent.</p>
<p>Another director of the Zeiss factory was even bolder. When the reporter asked about the situation in his factory on October 22, 1946, he glared at the Soviet officer next to him and then replied, "In the middle of the night, with less than four hours' notice, the occupation authorities forcibly seized three hundred skilled technicians from our factory and sent them to Soviet territory."</p>
<p>Such atrocities are commonplace behind the Iron Curtain in the Soviet occupation zone.</p>

<h3>Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations Stall: Failure to Reach Comprehensive Agreement; British Government to Continue Probing the Soviet Side</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The British Cabinet will decide within days whether it is worthwhile to continue Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations. British Foreign Trade Secretary Wilson, the chief negotiator, will report to the Cabinet on Monday on the reasons for the breakdown of the negotiations. A Department of Commerce spokesman said yesterday that there is a high probability that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will reach an agreement on timber supplies alone. The Soviet Union has agreed to supply the United Kingdom with 53,000 units of softwood and 10,000 cubic meters of mining timber, in exchange for sawmill machinery. This agreement has been reached, but it is difficult to determine at present whether it can stand alone as an agreement.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wilson, an agreement has largely been reached on trade matters, but the Soviet Union has raised financial issues as conditions for the conclusion of a trade agreement, which cannot be agreed upon. Mr. Wilson's remarks probably refer to the Soviet side's demand that the United Kingdom ease the terms of the 1941 financial agreement as a condition for the Soviet Union to lower the asking price for wheat. The financial agreement stipulates that the United Kingdom will lend the Soviet Union £55 million. The United Kingdom has agreed to reduce the interest on the loan from 2% to 1.5% after the trade agreement is concluded and to extend the repayment period. According to sources close to the government, the British government will continue to explore, through diplomatic channels, whether it is possible to reach an agreement.</p>

<h3>South Korea Convenes Public Rally</h3>

<h3>Anglo-American Meeting to Discuss Increasing German Coal Production; Location: Washington, Date: Within This Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] "The Sunday Times" diplomatic correspondent said: The difficulties hindering Anglo-American negotiations on Ruhr coal production have been overcome. A group of British experts, led by Strong, the British political advisor in Germany, is expected to depart for Washington within the week to discuss issues such as the operation, production, raw materials, and prices of the Ruhr mining area with American experts.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom initially opposed the United States' proposal on two points: (1) The scope of the negotiations was not broad enough; (2) A solution established without French participation would hinder France's position. On the first point, the United States has agreed to accept some of the United Kingdom's opinions, so some special issues in the British occupation zone, such as the depletion of dollar foreign exchange, are also expected to be discussed at that time. Regarding the aforementioned second point, the United States has agreed to give special consideration to France's position, and will solicit France's opinions after the meeting concludes. Although a three-power conference is not planned at present, France will be informed of the progress of the meeting at any time. The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent also said: If France is willing to have the French military occupation zone participate in the Anglo-American merger agreement, the difficulties currently hindering cooperation can be easily resolved, and a three-power summit would be even more practical.</p>

<h3>Late-Night Bloodbath Outside the Cathay Theatre; Police Officers and Civilians Killed and Injured Total 16; Military Police Platoon Leader Who Caused the Incident Has Been Detained Pending Investigation; Police Chief Yu Persuaded the Student Police to Disperse This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A major bloodbath occurred last night in front of the Cathay Theatre at the intersection of Rue du Consulat and Avenue Foch, resulting in more than a dozen deaths and injuries among police officers and civilians. It is reported that at around 10 p.m. last night, a citizen went to the Cathay Theatre to purchase two tickets, but three people intended to enter to watch the movie. The ticket inspector intervened, leading to a dispute, and summoned patrol officer Lu Lingheng, badge number 6588 (a student police officer from the 7th graduating class), ordering the three moviegoers to purchase another ticket to settle the matter. At this time, six or seven military police officers stationed at the theatre suddenly stepped forward to defend the moviegoers. Lu believed that this matter was within the scope of police duties and had nothing to do with the military police. While still advising the three moviegoers to buy a ticket, the military police became furious and severely beat Lu, causing him to be injured and spit blood. Lu rushed to take a streetcar back to the New Cheng Police Substation to report the incident. Many student police officers from the 7th graduating class in the substation were very indignant upon hearing the news. At the same time, news spread to various substations, and student police officers from the 7th graduating class from substations such as the Old Zha and Huangpu substations urgently assembled and drove to the Cathay Theatre empty-handed in trucks. At this time, student police officers from the New Cheng Substation had also surged to the scene, totaling more than a hundred people. Some entered the theatre, guarding the theatre doors and verbally criticizing the military police officers who had committed the assault. The military police immediately called the Kang Deng Road military police squad for reinforcements from inside the theatre. In a short time, the military police arrived in force in trucks, numbering more than a hundred people. After getting out of the trucks, they immediately deployed defenses. At the same time, they ordered all the student police officers inside the theatre to withdraw. The student police officers refused, and a standoff ensued. The military police officers on the upper floor of the theatre immediately opened fire from the windows with Thompson machine guns, and the defending military police officers also opened fire on the police, firing dozens of shots in total. The order on the street was immediately disrupted, and the cries of panic and the sound of fleeing footsteps mixed together into a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>At that time, a truck with license plate number 37573, loaded with watermelons (belonging to the Xu Shenji truck company from Majiaqiao), was coming from the west. The student police officers stopped it and boarded the truck one after another. The truck immediately started moving, but the front tire of the truck had been hit by a bullet and could not move forward smoothly. Student police officer Li Zhengguang was shot and killed in the center of the road behind the truck. Two other student police officers were shot and killed in the road (one died at the intersection of Rue du Consulat). There were also two children, a boy and a girl, in the truck who were injured. In addition, more than a dozen other student police officers and civilians were injured and were immediately sent to various hospitals. By around 1 a.m. this morning, the police station received a report that four more of the student police officers sent to the hospital had died of their injuries.</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, Zhang Da, the chief of the Inspection Department of the Police Bureau, and Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the New Cheng Substation, rushed to the scene to investigate. At the same time, the student police officers were indignant and gathered at the parade ground inside the New Cheng Substation, demanding that their superiors immediately seek a reasonable resolution. Police Chief Yu Shuping rushed to the Cathay Theatre to investigate upon hearing the news. Then he went to the New Cheng Substation and, together with Chief Zhang and Chief Zhuo, spoke to the more than a hundred student police officers who were gathered and refused to disperse. According to Police Chief Yu, he had consulted with Commander Xuan, and Commander Xuan had agreed to investigate the truth and punish the perpetrators severely. The student police officers dispersed at around 3 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Li Yutai, the military police platoon leader who initially stepped forward to interfere and caused the incident in the theatre, has been detained pending investigation.</p>

<h3>Former Abbot of Longhua Temple, Yongchan, Suspected of Being a Traitor, Colluding with Japanese Monks, Promoting the Enemy's Cause</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Following the accusation of traitorship against De Wu, Yongchan, the former abbot of Longhua Temple, has also been prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. According to the indictment of the High Prosecutor's Office: The monk Yongchan, 59 years old, from Xinghua. He was originally the supervisor of Longhua Temple. Due to a dispute with the monk Huizheng over the abbacy, there was a long-standing feud. After Shanghai fell, Yongchan colluded with the Japanese monk Sato to seize the position of abbot of Longhua Temple, organized the Sino-Japanese Buddhist Association, and vigorously promoted the enemy's cause in places such as Longhua Temple, Jieyin Temple, Jingxiu Nunnery, and the Penglai Market. During his tenure as abbot, he also colluded with local powerful forces to sell land belonging to Longhua Temple without authorization. The case was reported by the monk Xuanzheng, with vivid evidence. The monks Fuqing and Jialin also testified in court, and it was consistent with the records in the approval document issued by the pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau submitted by the complainant. It was determined that he had violated Article 3 and Article 2, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, and a public prosecution was initiated according to law.</p>
<h3>Sun Xun, Who Escaped from Prison, Indicted Under the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Sun Xun (also written as Sun Xun), a native of Wuxi, resided at No. 8 Lexuan Lane, Xichang Lane, Suzhou. Sun originally aspired to resist Japan, but after being arrested three times, he surrendered to the enemy. In the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], he joined the No. 76 Special Service Headquarters of the puppet regime as the head of the Investigation Section, and later served as the head of the Intelligence Section of the puppet Jiangsu Experimental District in Suzhou. After the Experimental District was reorganized into the Third Branch Bureau of the puppet Political Security Bureau, he served as the head of the puppet branch bureau. He established branch bureaus or directly subordinate groups in Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Yixing, Wujiang, and Nantong, dispatching lackeys such as Ge Shengwen, Jin Dingshi, Wu Linqi, Jiang Jingyan, Quan Yang, Wang Rusen, and Li Gang to serve as heads and deputy heads of puppet branch bureaus or directly subordinate group leaders. Later, when the puppet branch bureau was reorganized into the puppet Southern Jiangsu District, he left his post and went to Nanjing, serving as an inspector of the puppet Political Security Bureau and the major general deputy director of the puppet Second Branch Bureau (overseeing four provinces). After the victory of the War of Resistance, he mixed in with the Jiangnan Special District and Special Station, and was once arrested and detained in Suzhou, but later escaped from prison. The case was transferred by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to the High Procuratorate for investigation. Sun was prosecuted according to Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.</p>

<h3>Dispute Arises Over the Hiring of Crew Members on the Siming Steamer; Negotiations Underway</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union originally had more than 100,000 members. During the War of Resistance, they served on public and private ships, assisting government agencies and the military in transporting supplies and evacuating personnel. Under enemy bombing and strafing, their efforts were no less than fighting on the battlefield. After the war, the government recognized the significant sacrifices and casualties of the seamen during the war. Therefore, it specially protected the surviving seamen, considering their wartime contributions. The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Social Affairs issued regulations stipulating that any public or private shipping company could not independently hire crew members without a referral from the Seamen's Union. Recently, the Fenghua Steamship Company purchased an old ship originally named "Baohe" from the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., renamed it "Siming," and sent it to the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department for repairs. It plans to sail the Yangtze River. However, the company hired crew members for various departments on the ship without a referral from the Seamen's Union, and they boarded the ship to work. Despite repeated negotiations, the company ignored the union, causing public outrage among all the seamen, who plan to take active measures against the ship's authorities. Currently, the Chinese Seamen's Union is urging the seamen to remain calm and is negotiating with the Fenghua Steamship Company to avoid incidents.</p>
<h3>False Alarm on Jiangxi Road</h3>

<h3>Number of Unemployed Exceeds 130,000</h3>
<p>Xue, the deputy director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the number of unemployed people in this city is estimated to have exceeded 130,000, and the family members who depend on them for support have not yet been included. This highlights the severity of the unemployment problem in this city.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau to Host Another Tour of the Largest Pumping Station</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Public Works Bureau recently hosted tours for various sectors of society to visit the seawall project and the pier construction project. Now, the large-scale pumping station at Rihui Port on Xujiahui Road has been completed and connected to electricity. It was test-run once during the last high tide, and the results were satisfactory. The bureau has scheduled another tour for various sectors of society on August 4th, which is the 18th day of the sixth lunar month, a high tide period. This is the largest pumping station in the city, requiring 275 horsepower and capable of pumping 60,000 gallons of water per hour. After the pumping station is completed, the flooding situation in the central district of the former French Concession, such as the Thirteen-Story Building and Madang Road, is expected to be alleviated.</p>
<h3>Heat Reaches Record High; Yesterday's Maximum was 99.9; New Typhoon Heading Towards Shanghai; Cooler Weather Expected in Two or Three Days</h3>
<p>According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the temperature yesterday was 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit, setting a new record for the extreme heat this year. However, it is still slightly lower than the 104 degrees recorded on July 12, 1934. Therefore, in terms of individual heat, it has not broken the new record in the past 73 years. However, the highest average temperature for July in the past 73 years was 94.8 degrees. In terms of average temperature, July of this year has indeed broken the new record in the past 73 years. The reason for yesterday's record-breaking temperature is likely due to the contact between the tropical air current and the Pacific air mass along the coast of our country. The forecast for today's weather is still sunny and cloudy, and the temperature is expected to be similar to yesterday. There may be localized thunderstorms in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. According to the observatory, a new typhoon has been discovered in the western Pacific, currently located at 20 degrees north latitude and 217 degrees east longitude, with a west-northwest wind direction. Shanghai will be attacked. If the wind direction turns west-west, Shanghai will be even more severely attacked. Therefore, the observatory predicts that the weather in Shanghai will turn cooler in two or three days. However, August of this year will still be extremely hot.</p>
<h3>Quotas for Eligible Men in Each District Set; One Conscript for Every 77 Men on Average</h3>

<h3>Goal for Monthly Sales of Enemy and Puppet Assets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Areas Set at 50 Billion</h3>
<p>Various enemy and puppet assets seized and confiscated by the Enemy and Puppet Assets Clearing Office are being auctioned off one after another. To accelerate the process and increase national treasury revenue, the government previously set a goal of selling 100 billion in enemy and puppet assets in the valley areas each month. The specific breakdown has recently been approved as follows: 50 billion yuan per month for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area, 24 billion yuan per month for the Tianjin area, 12 billion yuan per month for the Shandong and Qingdao area, 5 billion yuan per month for the Wuhan area, 5 billion yuan per month for the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian area, and 1 billion yuan per month for the Henan area. According to the person in charge of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Clearing Office, the enemy assets in this area are already being auctioned off, and the various rebel assets are currently being auctioned off at an accelerated pace. The monthly income may exceed 5 billion yuan. However, there are many property disputes regarding enemy and rebel assets, especially rebel assets, and thorough investigations are quite complicated. If the government could have strict regulations regarding various property disputes, it would be easier to handle, auctions could be strengthened, and national treasury revenue could be increased significantly each month.</p>
<h3>Reflections on Education; Zhu Jingnong Broadcasted on Jiancheng Radio Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] This newspaper held its 17th Sunday Special Broadcast at Jiancheng Radio Station yesterday, inviting Zhu Jingnong (see picture), the president of Guanghua University, to speak on "Reflections on Education." The following is a record of the main points of his speech:</p>
<p>Why do we run education? What is the basic spirit of education? The purpose of education is to consolidate the foundation of democratic politics. Can we achieve this goal? We now need to review this issue. I have three thoughts on this issue:</p>
<p>We must cultivate the spirit of love.</p>
<p>(1) Is the foundation of our education built on the word "love" or on the word "hate"? Education is like a farmer planting crops: you reap what you sow. If it is "education of love," the result will be love, mutual assistance, and cooperation. If it is "education of hate," the result will be mutual struggle and fratricide. Everyone knows that China is very chaotic. What is the cause of the chaos? It is because the concept of loving others has not been planted. Once I saw a slogan on the street: "We don't want anything, we only have eyes! Eyes! Hate!" How terrible, this concept of fratricide. If mankind wants to survive and develop, it must first eradicate the concept of hate and cultivate the spirit of love. The core of Chinese morality is "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace." Loving the country is loyalty, and loving parents is filial piety. Benevolence is loving people and things, and loving friends requires trustworthiness. Loving the world can lead to true peace. Therefore, the center of these eight words is the word "love." Those of us who run education must plant the seeds of love and cultivate the spirit of love.</p>
<p>We must have the spirit of abiding by the law.</p>
<p>(2) What holds together many people with different opinions in a democratic country? It is the spirit of abiding by the law. The constitution must be followed by everyone to be effective. Young people must develop the spirit of abiding by the law in school. If everyone abides by the law, we can guarantee democratic politics. Without abiding by the law, the constitution is just a piece of paper. Let me give two examples to show the spirit of abiding by the law in other countries. (1) Last year, there was a major coal miners' strike in the United States. Because the lives of people across the country were greatly affected, the court issued an order requiring the strike to end by a certain date, otherwise legal sanctions would be imposed. The chairman of the strike committee obeyed the order and ended the strike on time. (2) The car of Mrs. Roosevelt, the former president of the United States, injured someone. The court summoned and prosecuted her in the same way and revoked her car registration. Mrs. Roosevelt complied and never used her status to evade responsibility. What China lacks is the spirit of abiding by the law. For example, when taking school exams, people don't rely on their knowledge but ask people to write letters and plead for special favors. Last time, I saw in the newspaper that students were rioting in court, making it impossible to start the trial. These are all phenomena of not abiding by the law. Those of us who run education must cultivate the spirit of abiding by the law in young people to help consolidate the foundation of democratic politics.</p>
<p>We must have the demeanor of statesmen.</p>
<p>(3) We should cultivate young people with the demeanor of statesmen through education. We must respect the personality of those who share our views, and we must also respect the personality of those who disagree with us. Kant said: "A gentleman respects the personality of the other party." This sentence is worthy of our deep thought. The habit of our people is to praise those who agree with us as saints, and to scold, insult, expose private affairs, spread rumors, and use all means to attack those who disagree with us. Everyone uses various methods to destroy the reputation of the other party in order to win the leadership. This is a terrible phenomenon. We must have a spirit of tolerance and be able to accommodate various different opinions to cultivate the demeanor of statesmen to establish democratic politics. The above is a very disorganized discussion of three thoughts on current education: (1) We must cultivate the spirit of love, (2) We must have the spirit of abiding by the law, and (3) We must have the demeanor of statesmen. Whether the above three points can be achieved depends on whether we who are educated can lead by example. Therefore, I feel that those who run education should have several attitudes in order to lead young people.</p>
<p>Those engaged in education should have six spirits.</p>
<p>Running education is not for wealth or fame. Education is a difficult career. Those who run education must have the following six spirits: (1) The compassion to save the world. Education is difficult and requires the spirit of enduring humiliation, bearing heavy burdens, and not being afraid of sacrifice. (2) The habit of reading. Education is a kind of growth. You yourself must grow every day to help others grow. Therefore, you must constantly strive for progress in learning. (3) The enthusiasm for transformation. Running education is not about being conservative. You must actively improve the unsatisfactory aspects of the education field. (4) The ability to influence. Running education is like a loving mother treating her children: be kind, tolerant, and benevolent to educate the next generation of young people. (5) Noble ideals. Confucius said: "A scholar who is determined to pursue the truth and is ashamed of wearing poor clothes and eating poor food is not worth discussing with." Because of noble ideals, you will not haggle over the difficulties and hardships of the moment. (6) Strong physique. Education is a difficult and demanding career. Without a strong physique, you cannot shoulder the heavy responsibility of education. The above six points are the spirits that we who run education should have. With this, we can effectively guide and educate young people in a patient and systematic way.</p>
<p>Let us who run education now review what results have been achieved in decades of education. Has people's hearts changed? At this time when democratic politics is beginning to be built, we who run education should discuss a common goal and move forward.</p>

<h3>Lucky Ones After Victory: Rongfeng Factory Expanding; Monthly Production of 50,000 Bolts of Fine Cloth; Difficulty is Insufficient Cotton Allocation</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Rongfeng Yarn Factory was established in June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, and it has now been over nine years. Among general yarn factories, it is still quite young. It was born under the bayonets of the enemy, struggling for a full seven years, and after victory, it finally received support from the motherland. Within two years, Rongfeng Yarn Factory greatly expanded.</p>
<p>Initially, it only had 11,000 spindles. In the 29th year of the Republic of China, it increased to 20,400 spindles and 420 looms. In the 32nd year, the textile industry was suppressed by the enemy and could not develop, so a paper mill was established separately. In May of the 33rd year, it merged with the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory. At that time, the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory had been shut down due to serious damage by the Japanese army. In September of the 34th year, Rongfeng took over, and after major repairs, it was renamed Rongfeng Second Factory and started operation. There were 10,800 spindles, 620 looms, and complete bleaching, dyeing, and printing equipment.</p>
<p>The Second Factory is located at 11282 Zhulu Road, covering an area of 47 mu. It is currently undergoing large-scale construction, building new factory buildings, and expanding cotton spinning and dyeing and printing equipment. They also have an attached iron factory and a sand factory, specializing in the manufacturing of spindles and textile machinery parts. Currently, they have products with good results, not inferior to imported goods. It is a pity that they cannot yet produce in large quantities. However, they have a goal to manufacture their own spinning machines, weaving machines, and all textile printing and dyeing steel parts, becoming self-sufficient. The general management office of Rongfeng Yarn Factory has drafted a detailed plan, proceeding step by step, and has already achieved initial success.</p>
<p>Rongfeng's development can truly be described as "rapid." It has only been two years since the victory. Their production capacity, compared with the long-established Wing On Textile Factory, is already in a ratio of five to one. Their First Factory produces 20-count Golden Bridge yarn, coarse cloth, coarse twill, serge, khaki, and the paper mill produces yarn wrapping paper and glazed paper. The yarn production is about 1,000 pieces per month, the cloth production is about 22,000 bolts, and the paper production is about 180,000 pounds. The Second Factory produces about 600 pieces of 20-count Golden Bridge yarn per month, and about 30,000 bolts of Bumble Bee fine cloth. The bleaching and dyeing department operates day and night, and can bleach and dye 8,000 bolts of fine cloth per day. Currently, due to various restrictions, it cannot be fully operational, so it can only bleach and dye 2,000 bolts per week.</p>
<p>The procurement of raw materials, coal, and electricity is currently the biggest challenge. The two factories consume 6,000 dan of cotton per month, but the government authorities allocate a limited amount, and the cotton reserves are gradually decreasing. The only remedy is to purchase domestic cotton to supplement. However, the price of domestic cotton is higher, so the production cost also increases.</p>
<p>The reporter visited the Second Factory. The brand-new white stone walls and the brand-new factory buildings inside the walls immediately indicate that this is a vibrant factory. Everywhere on the ground are wood, cement, and lime. Masons and carpenters work rhythmically, echoing the rumbling of machines. The female workers who have finished work quietly pass by on one side. The staff in the factory director's office and the workers among the machines do not relax their tense working mood because of visitors.</p>
<p>The reporter took a quick tour from the cotton pile stack to the cotton mixing and opening, steel wire machines (carding machines), cotton slivers, roving, fine yarn, sizing, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, and to the bundled cloth ready for shipment. Factory Director Jin Delin told me: "Everyone here gets along very well, and there are no labor-management disputes, because the factory really takes care of the workers' welfare at all times." He also wanted me to see their newly built worker's restaurant, and the factory director smiled and said to me: "Isn't it more exquisite than the restaurant in a university?" I smiled and nodded.</p>
<h3>Promoting Eastern Art Lacquer Carving; Wu Songgao Plans an Exhibition First, Then Mass Production for Overseas Sales</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Wu Songgao, a Chinese radio expert, studied radio in the United States for 19 years, with innovative inventions and a prominent reputation abroad. Several years before the Anti-Japanese War, Wu returned to China and set up a factory on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, with excellent results, surpassing even the best British and American radios. During the Anti-Japanese War, Wu lived in seclusion in Shanghai, assisting the government in secret work, supplying many transceivers, and inventing electrical codes. He secretly set up radio stations in Ping, Shanghai, and Chongqing to communicate news, making great contributions. During this period, in order to avoid the attention of the enemy and puppets, Wu used art carvings to disguise radio equipment, which sparked his interest. He then engaged in research that combined science, art, and handicrafts, and invented five-color paint. Over ten years, he created a wide array of radio art pieces.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter was invited to visit Wu's residence. The items on display were all brightly colored and exquisitely patterned. The radio was hidden in the shells of various carved objects. For example, under a rectangular large goldfish tank, an object resembling a fir wood cabinet was actually a 19-tube long and short wave radio. A radio was also installed in a seven-story pagoda. Another spherical globe was another form of a six-tube radio. The carvings mostly featured dragons, phoenixes, flowers, birds, fairies, landscapes, and other ancient patterns, lacquered with five-color paint. They can truly be called representatives of Eastern art. Therefore, in addition to the enjoyment of radio broadcasting, the patterns and forms make them the best decorations for a room. In addition to radios, there are also art pieces such as screens, jewelry boxes, handbags, and tea trays, as well as safe door locks that can be opened using numerical codes, all ingeniously crafted and very impressive.</p>
<p>Wu plans to mass-produce these artworks for overseas sales and intends to hold an exhibition first. He believes that the artistic transformation of these scientific and mechanical products can reduce the world's desire for power and disputes.</p>

<h3>Tears of a Woman; Blood of a Neighbor; Speaking Out for Justice Leads to Disaster; An Axe to the Head; Zhang Songtao's Life is in Danger</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Lin Yuxia, a woman from Haimen, 21 years old, with a secondary education, lives in No. 3 Zhongxing Lane, Baoshang Road, Zhabei. Lin has many boyfriends. Every evening, she goes out to invite friends to her house for entertainment. Ying Ayu, the second landlord, hated this very much. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, she warned Lin not to associate with her boyfriends in the future to avoid disturbing people's dreams late at night. However, Lin felt insulted and went to her fellow villager Ding Qitai to complain, asking for a way to retaliate. Ding then gathered many people that evening, each carrying weapons such as axes, and broke into Ying Ayu's house, wantonly destroying furniture. The scene was chaotic. At this time, a neighbor, Zhang Songtao, arrived and spoke out for justice, which angered them. Ding Qitai used an axe to violently chop Zhang's head, fracturing the skull in a wound three inches deep, with blood flowing non-stop. The assailants saw the enormity of the disaster and fled in a panic. The North Station Police Branch Bureau, after receiving the report, sent personnel to investigate.

<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Precautions for Raising Funds for National Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Education has formulated precautions for raising funds for national schools in all provinces and cities in the future and has sent a telegram to all education bureaus for implementation: (1) Due to the difficulty of local finances for national education funds, in addition to raising funds for interest to make up for the shortfall, the following items should continue to be handled: (A) Regulations such as the method of persuading temples and caves to donate property to be used as school funds, the organizational charter of the fund management committee, the method of county inspectors supervising the raising of funds, and the detailed rules for local schools to use the funds, which have been formulated, should be strictly implemented. Those that have not been formulated should be formulated and reported for approval and implementation as soon as possible. (B) Stipulate the amount to be raised within the 36th academic year and complete it within the time limit. (C) Introduce effective fundraising methods from various places. (D) Expand publicity, mobilize forces from all parties, and actively raise funds. (E) Reward personnel who have contributed to raising funds in the previous year. (F) After the funds are used to purchase property, complete the transfer, draw up maps, and report and announce them. (G) Check and report the amount of funds raised in the previous year and report to the Ministry for filing. (2) For the funds that have been raised by each school, since the implementation of the method of sorting out public funds and properties, some localities have misinterpreted the sorting out laws and regarded education funds as ordinary public properties, which are managed uniformly by the county and city. This should be corrected. (3) As the amount of funds raised by each school increases day by day, the management and use of funds should be strengthened: (A) If the management committee has not been established, it should be established as soon as possible and strive for a sound organization. (B) The management committee should hire local elders to participate. (C) Prices fluctuate from time to time. The funds raised should be planned for use, with the principle of purchasing real estate as the main principle. Other methods, such as building school warehouses, storing grain or fertilizer, which have been effectively implemented in various places, can also be adopted. The above items can be considered based on local conditions, and detailed methods for the management and use of school funds can be formulated and submitted to the Ministry for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Federation; Petition the Municipal Council; Speaker Pan Personally Receives and Instructs Three Points</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] The Representatives' Meeting of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Federation previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council, and on the morning of the 26th of this month at 10:00 AM, Xi Zhengfu, Gu Risan, Li Youzhang, Zhu Lie, Zhang Zhihua, Xu Ziling, Li Zhanren, Cao Junshi, Mao Wenpei, Huang Shiping and other ten people paid a visit to Speaker Pan. First, the representatives explained to Speaker Shen their gratitude for the Municipal Council's passage of regulations on advanced training fees and increased education and youth funding. They then made three oral requests, to which Speaker Pan gave his opinions one by one as follows: (1) The teacher advanced training fees had already been approved by the Municipal Council, which sympathized with the difficult lives of teachers. The Education Bureau had previously reported that 3.6 billion yuan of advanced training fees for this semester had been distributed to teachers in various schools. If there are insufficient funds now, the competent authorities should be responsible for raising them. Starting from August, based on the current markup of 1,800 times, the future increase in advanced training fees will be in the ratio of 11 to 18. That is, those who previously received 100,000 yuan per month should receive about 170,000 yuan per month in the next term. In short, I personally sympathize with the difficult lives of teachers. (2) Some places have already adopted methods such as collecting school rice, meal allowances, and teacher respect money to make up for the difficult lives of teachers. This city may also be able to adopt this method. However, the amount to be collected and the principles of distribution should be carefully studied, and fairness should be the main principle. Otherwise, disputes will arise and cause trouble. If the proposal is approved and implemented in the future, the procedures for the distribution of the money collected should be as quick as possible. (3) Education should be based on adapting to national conditions and taking into account the students themselves. All those responsible for the practical work of education should specifically ask the authorities to pay attention to various problems based on experience and facts. At present, the two issues that urgently need to be addressed in Shanghai's current education are: (1) how to make students physically healthy, have good conduct, and not be infected with current customs; (2) how to reduce the complicated subjects for students so that they can be trained with basic methods of learning. The representatives were deeply moved by Speaker Pan's earnest instructions.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order Specifying; Fee Standards for Private Middle and Elementary Schools; High School Tuition Must Not Exceed 400,000 Yuan; Districts Such as Beijing and Shanghai May Collect the Highest Figures as Specified</h3>
<p>[China News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Education recently stated that private middle and elementary schools in various places are currently enrolling students, and some will start school soon. In order to avoid exploiting students by excessively charging fees or raising tuition standards, affecting too many students from dropping out of school, a special order was issued to the education authorities of all provinces and cities to specify the fee standards for private middle and elementary schools as follows: (1) High school tuition fees must not exceed 400,000 yuan; (2) Junior high school fees shall not exceed 350,000 yuan; (3) The maximum fee for private senior elementary schools is 250,000 yuan; (4) The fee for junior elementary schools is 200,000 yuan. As for the specific figures, the local education authorities must reduce or increase them based on local prices and cost of living. In areas such as Shanghai and Nanjing, the price index is the highest, and the highest figures specified may be collected. In the Tianjin-Beijing area, these figures should be reduced by 15%. The standards for collecting miscellaneous fees may be appropriately increased by 50% with reference to the previously issued standards for public schools, namely: (1) Primary school miscellaneous fees are 20,000 yuan, and library fees, sports fees, and scout fees are 10,000 yuan in total. (2) Middle school sports fees are 10,000 yuan, library fees are 10,000 yuan, and lecture notes and printing fees are 10,000 yuan. High school dormitory inspection fees are 20,000 yuan, and junior high school scout fees are 5,000 yuan. In addition, water and electricity fees for boarding students are uniformly 50,000 yuan per semester. If there are other names for charging fees, the local education authorities should be responsible for thoroughly investigating and strictly handling them. If it is necessary to collect additional fees due to facts and environmental factors, it must also be approved by the competent authorities. The Ministry of Education will send personnel to supervise and inspect them at any time.</p>

<h3>A Solid and Practical Institution of Learning: National Tongji University</h3>
<p>— Qi Jufu</p>
<p>Tongji University was founded four years before the Republic of China, and it has a history of forty years. In the past forty years, it has made two major contributions: First, in academics, it promoted Sino-German cultural exchange; second, in technology, it saved people—patients (a major contribution from medical students) and also killed people—enemies (Tongji engineering graduates mostly served in the arms industry). Therefore, after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, some people proposed that it be renamed the National Defense University. (During the war, most of China's more than fifty arms factories, with the exception of one or two, were headed by Tongji alumni, and the magnitude of their contribution can be imagined.)</p>
<p>Looking back to the pre-war era, if someone went to Wusong, they would surely see a large area of brilliant German-style buildings, sparsely and densely hidden among lush greenery. Among these buildings stood a tall chimney, which was the National Tongji University, renowned for its medical and engineering programs, and its affiliated factories. However, unfortunately, precisely because its contributions were in specific areas, as soon as the "August 13th" war broke out, its fate was sealed. In a few days, a magnificent academy was completely destroyed by the enemy's navy with concentrated artillery fire. Now, not only is there not a single tile left of the original site, but it also takes a lot of effort to find out the original scope. As a result, the restored Tongji University had to be scattered throughout the suburbs of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Established as a National University by Order of the Ministry in the Sixteenth Year</p>
<p>Originally, Tongji University was founded by the German, Mr. Salong. At that time, it was called Tongji German Medical and Engineering Vocational School. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, due to the European War, it was closed by the French. The Chinese then took it back and ran it themselves, renaming it Tongji Medical and Engineering Vocational School to distinguish it from the previous name used by the Germans, but it remained a private school. It was not until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China that it was renamed National Tongji University by order of the Ministry, and in accordance with the university organizational structure, the medical department was changed to the Medical College and the engineering department to the Engineering College. Later, it was expanded and established over the years, and now it has five colleges of medicine, engineering, science, law, and literature, with a total of sixteen departments and two sections. In addition, there are affiliated senior vocational schools, affiliated senior nursing schools, and three affiliated middle schools. In addition, there are two affiliated hospitals, one named Tongji University Hospital-U.S. China Hospital, and one named Tongji University Affiliated Hospital, and a practical factory. Its scope is the largest among all colleges and universities in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Tongji is currently the only institution of higher learning in China that introduces Germanic culture, so its first major foreign language is German. Those who do not know German must study at the New Student Academy (i.e., the German Language Remedial Class) for one year (freshmen in the literature and law colleges are temporarily exempt from one year of German remedial instruction), and can only be promoted to the university after a rigorous examination.</p>
<p>Tongji's Current Education System is Different from Other Universities</p>
<p>Tongji's academic system is very different from that of other universities in the country. The following is an introduction to Tongji's academic system for readers: A, Science and Engineering Departments:</p>
<p>(1) Medical College (undivided)—divided into front and back phases, with the front phase lasting two and a half years, the back phase lasting two and a half years, and the final year being an internship. Including the first year of German remedial instruction, the total is seven years for graduation. The final examination for the first phase is extremely strict, usually presided over by an old German professor. The scope of his oral examination is very broad, which is a difficult hurdle.</p>
<p>(2) Engineering College—Originally, it was also divided into front and back phases, but now it adopts an academic year system. The courses for each academic year are generally assigned by the school, with no distinction between required and elective courses. Counting one year of German remedial instruction, two years of factory internship (the civil engineering and surveying departments have temporarily suspended the internship), and four years of regular courses thereafter, the total is six years for graduation. (Engineering colleges at general universities usually graduate in four years.)</p>
<p>(3) College of Science—Academic year system, one year of German remedial instruction, followed by four years of regular courses, for a total of five years for graduation. B, General Science Departments</p>
<p>(4) Law College—Tongji Law College is the only institution in China that introduces the "Continental Legal System." (According to the world's legal system, it is divided into the Continental Legal System and the Maritime Legal System. China belongs to the Continental Legal System.) It was established in accordance with the new system proposed at last year's Educational Restoration Conference. Currently, there are only four groups, namely, A Judicial Group, B Theoretical Legal Studies Group, C International Public Law, and D Administrative Law Group. In the future, it is planned to reorganize into departments. All groups adopt the credit system, emphasizing both German and English, and graduation takes four years.</p>
<p>(5) College of Liberal Arts—With the exception of the German Studies group in the Foreign Languages Department, which takes five years to graduate, all other departments generally take four years to graduate. The credit system is also adopted.</p>
<p>Knowledgeable Youths Enlist in the Army, Tongji Students are Uniquely Numerous</p>
<p>Because Tongji introduces Germanic culture, and its predecessor was a vocational university, the traditional spirit of Tongji is solid, simple, hardworking, and not talking much. However, being solid and simple is definitely not being rigid, working hard is definitely not working blindly, and not talking much is definitely not having nothing to say; on the contrary, as long as they recognize that it is justice, the public interest, they will work hard and do it to the end. As long as they believe that it is reactionary and destructive, such as the interests of a few, they will speak out, frankly, and loudly. I still remember that in the winter of the 33rd year, Guizhou was lost, and the capital was shaken. Chairman Chiang called on knowledgeable youths to join the army. Although all schools responded in unison, only Tongji had the most teachers and students actually participating. At that time, Tongji University had only over a thousand students, and more than six hundred of them joined the army, which was more than any other school. Later, for some reason, students from various schools returned to school midway, but almost no one from Tongji did so until the government issued a demobilization order last year, when the Tongji students finally returned.</p>
<p>Three Types of Extracurricular Activities, Emphasizing Academic Research</p>
<p>In their spare time, Tongji students' activities tend to focus on three aspects: (1) Research—They have organized reading groups, departmental academic societies, and run various wall newspapers and publications. However, most of these "associations" belong to academic research, and the wall newspapers and publications rarely involve politics (but they are not indifferent to politics). For example, the school-wide "Autonomous Week" purely reports on school news; "New Tongji Bi-Monthly" is half school news and half literature; the Engineering College's "Wildfire" is purely literature; "Riverside Grass" is a poetry journal; "Storm" is comprehensive; the Law College's "Original Man" is a law journal. "Xuguang" focuses on legal discussions and school news; "Law Society Bulletin" is purely legal papers; "Zhenbao" focuses on literature, and legal discussions; "Jian" clips current affairs reports and papers; ... This can be seen in general. (2) Art—Tongji currently has a Erhu Research Society, a Violin Society, a Harmonica Society, a Choir, a Drama Society, a Peking Opera Society, etc., which is truly a "hall of strings and recitations." (3) Sports—Tongji students have always attached great importance to sports, so although they focus on vocational studies, the physique of the average student is quite "solid." This is the result of their usual love of sports, and it is also the consistent style of Tongji students for forty years. Therefore, after returning to Shanghai, Tongji was nicknamed "Dark Horse" in university ball games, and it was no accident that it subsequently won the championships in both football and volleyball.</p>
<h3>The Champions of Women's Basketball from Beijing and Shanghai Meet: The Green Team Wins a Hard-Fought Victory Over the Xiang Team, 44 to 37. The First Half Ends in a 19-All Tie. The Scores Rise and Fall Sharply. The Final Quarter Decides the Game.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In the nearly 100-degree humid weather, even those who sit still all day are sweating profusely and complaining about the heat, let alone a dragon-tiger battle. The Xiang team, a strong women's basketball team from Nanjing, played against the Green team, the women's basketball champion of this city, at the City Stadium last night at 8 p.m. This was the second game for the visiting team in Shanghai. The situation was tense and the scores went up and down, full of thrills. Nearly a thousand people supported the event. In a hard-fought battle, the first half ended in a 19-point tie. In the second half, the Green team scored 25 points and the Xiang team scored 18 points. As a result, the Green team won 44 to 37. Although the Xiang team lost, it was still honorable.</p>
<p>The three forwards of the Xiang team had excellent coordination skills, but sometimes their luck with the ball was poor, and the shots often bounced on the rim. The Green team was too nervous and slightly out of sorts. The hot weather also had an impact. The backcourt was not as good as the forwards. Although they worked hard, they still showed gaps from time to time. Liu Shouguang, Chen Bin, and Xixun were the main players of the Xiang team. The Green team relied on Liu Zhen, Dou, and Huang Mingyuan to charge forward. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Green Team Showed its Power, Leading by Only One Point</p>
<p>Presenting flags and taking photos have become routine pre-game procedures. Chen Bin of the Xiang team and Huang Mingyuan of the Green team presented flags to each other. The referees were Liu Hesheng and Yu Juju. The guest team started with Gao Yingying, Liu Shouguang, Xixun, Chen Bin, Wan Shunxiang, and Tan Biyun. The Green team started with Huang Mingyuan, Li Yunzhi, Liu Zhendou, Wu Ailian, Wang Weizhen, and Wu Meiyi. The Green team started with the ball. Liu Yizhen Dou scored from the left side from a distance. Because of a technical foul by Wu Ailian of the opposing team, Gao Yingying made a free throw. Huang Mingyuan of the Green team made two free throws out of one throw, taking the lead with 6 to 1. Gao Yingying of the guest team scored. Wu Meiyi of the Shanghai team fouled. Liu Shouguang scored two empty balls. Zhenshi retaliated with two points. Shouguang came back again, and the Green team led by only one point, 8 to 7. Seeing that the situation was not good, they called a timeout. Shou actually tied the score at 9-all. Huang Mingyuan was very confident with free throws and added three points through throws. Liu scored again. The Green team led by only one point, 12 to 11, in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The Xiang Team Surpassed the Green Team, the First Half Ended in a Tie</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Wan Shunxiang of the Beijing team replaced Gao Yingying. Liu Zhenshi of the Green team dribbled and scored. The Xiang team's forwards passed the ball well, but the ball luck was too bad in several attempts. Chen Bin scored from a distance. Liu Shouguang made a rotation under the guard of Wu Ailian, initially tying the score at 15-all. Zhenbin made a free throw. Chen Bin and Shouguang each scored one ball, surpassing the Green team 16 to 19. The Green team called a second timeout. Huang Mingyuan and Liu Zhensai scored successively, and the first half ended in a 19-all tie, with applause rising.</p>
<p>The Green Team Fought Hard and Led by Six Points</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third quarter, Wan Shunxiang and Chen Bin scored two balls in an instant. Shouguang made a free throw, and it became 23 to 19 (the Xiang team took the lead). Mingyuan scored one ball, and Shunxiang made another free throw, 24 to 21. The three forwards of the Xiang team coordinated their attack, Chen Bin rushed in, Huang Mingyuan flexed her muscles Ming, Wu Ailian transferred the ball from Cai Shiqiu, and the game continued to progress. Zhenbao showed her shooting skills, the camera flashed, just as Yuan jumped up and scored, making it a 26-point tie. Zhenbao Mingyuan Yunzhu scored successively. In the third quarter, the Green team relied on a hard fight and led by six points again, 32 to 26.</p>
<p>Thrillers Abounded, Xiang Risked Defeat</p>
<p>The final quarter of the battle was even more tense. Huang Mingyuan made two empty free throws. Chen Bin of the Xiang team was active. Wan Shunxiang also scored. Yunzhu and Shouguang scored alternately, 36 to 34, with the Xiang team trailing by only two points. Mingyuan made one of two free throws, and Zhenhai scored 39 to 34. Wan Shunxiang "graduated" and was replaced by Gao Yingying. In the last two minutes, the competition became more intense. As a result, the score was 44 to 37, and the Xiang team was defeated.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Industrial Association, Machine Industry League, and Other Groups Oppose Opening Trade with Japan; Yesterday's Reception for the Press Explained the Reasons for Temporarily Delaying the Opening</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Association, the Shanghai Machine Industry League, and other groups, to express the industrial community's position on the issue of opening trade between China and Japan, held a press conference at 3 PM on the 27th at the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road. Representatives from the Industrial Association, including Hu Boxiang and Tian Heqing, representatives from the Production Promotion Association, including Mao Shengdong, representatives from the National Goods Production and Sales Association, including Wang Xingyao, and dozens of newspaper reporters attended.</p>
<p>Chairman Hu Boxiang gave an opening speech, stating: "The industrial community has petitioned several times on the issue of opening trade between China and Japan, but without effect. Currently, the authorities are proceeding with sending an economic delegation to Japan, and the opening period is imminent. For the sake of survival, the industrial community is holding a symposium here today to express its solemn position and hopes the press will provide assistance."</p>
<p>Tian Heqing, who had returned from petitioning in Beijing, rose to report, stating: "The significant impact of opening trade between China and Japan on China's industrial community is already well-known to those in authority and need not be repeated. The reasons why the U.S. government allowed Japan to open foreign trade were (1) to restore the U.S.'s pre-war international trade position and (2) to reduce the burden on the occupying forces in Japan. The Potsdam Declaration also stipulates this. However, we do not permanently oppose opening trade with Japan; we only believe that opening now is premature. This opening of trade with Japan is due to the demands of the American people. The U.S. is a country with overproduction and needs to expand commercially. But China's situation is different. For more than two years after the victory, the national industry has been barely surviving due to the changing circumstances. The consequences after opening trade with Japan are unimaginable. Furthermore, this time, the opening is for private trade. The prices of Japanese goods being dumped in the future may be lower than other imported goods, but the profits will go to a few powerful private individuals. Besides the industrial community being directly harmed, there will be no subsidy for the country.</p>
<p>National Industry Inevitably Affected</p>
<p>According to statistics, from August 15th to the end of this year, goods that China could import from Japan amount to over 99 million U.S. dollars, while China could export to Japan about 44 million U.S. dollars, resulting in a trade deficit of over 50 million U.S. dollars. According to another statistic, the Allied Headquarters in Japan has approved Japan's export of over 50 kinds of goods, including five categories: (1) Textiles, such as linen, rayon, yarn, wool fabrics, etc.; (2) Daily necessities, such as paper, buttons, etc.; (3) Handicrafts, such as coral, ivory, carvings, etc.; (4) Chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid, asphalt, etc.; (5) Electrical appliances, such as cameras, telescopes, etc. The Allied Headquarters has approved Japan's import of 28 kinds of goods: (1) Agricultural products, plants such as grains and timber, and animals such as ivory; (2) Minerals, such as bauxite, graphite, gypsum, mica, etc.; (3) Industrial raw materials, such as pig iron, quartz, sugar, salt, glue, lacquer, starch, tung oil, tallow, and intermediate products of pigments.</p>
<p>Based on the above two statistics, we can see the impact on our national industry after the opening of trade with Japan. What we are asking for now is not a permanent ban on opening trade with Japan. But we hope that (1) the authorities will temporarily postpone the opening and choose a suitable time to open. (2) If the government believes that opening trade with Japan is inevitable, we hope to expand the scope and manage it in a coordinated manner, with the Central Trust Bureau conducting the trade based on the principle of barter, so that the trade rights are not manipulated by a few special individuals, and bureaucratic capital profits. (3) We hope to immediately stop sending the economic delegation to Japan because the currently decided 64 business representatives cannot represent the national industry and commerce. (4) China-Japan trade will need to return to normal one day. We hope the government can work with the national industry and commerce community to organize a research committee on trade with Japan to study various technical issues. Currently, countries like England and the United States are advocating free trade, but free trade requires industrial development to a certain stage. In China's current situation, to protect the national industry, considerable restrictions and gradual progress are still needed.</p>
<p>Representatives Present Their Opinions</p>
<p>Next, Cheng Shouchong, a representative from the Machine Industry League, gave his opinion, hoping the government would actively cultivate the national industry as the foundation for completing the task of national construction. Zhang Zilian, another representative from the Machine Industry League, stated, "It is probably difficult to stop sending the economic delegation to Japan because of international influence, so we can only ask to reduce the number of representatives. As for opening trade with Japan, given the current environment of China's industrial community, it must wait at least five years. If it is opened now, it will not only be harmful and unprofitable, but the consequences will be unimaginable."</p>
<p>Wang Xingyao, a representative from the National Goods Production and Sales Association, believed that "If the government can properly protect the national industry, it can also deal a major blow to the dumping of Japanese goods in the future. However, the industrial community itself also needs to revitalize and propose self-help methods."</p>
<p>Mao Shengdong, a representative from the Production Promotion Association, and Pan Shihao, a representative from the cotton textile industry, successively gave their opinions. Mao believed that the Chinese industrial community should face the seriousness of the current issues and carefully study self-help methods. Pan specifically requested that the government improve its international trade policies and promote the importance of national attention to the use of national goods, believing that if these two points cannot be achieved, it would be difficult for the national industry to develop and grow.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Zhang Mengzhao, representing the private textile industry, reported on the recent situation of Japanese textile production and the impact on the Chinese textile industry after opening trade. Hu Xiyuan, based on the position of the Machine Industry League, hoped that everyone present would provide concrete suggestions to propose to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to improve issues of immediate concern, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Ministry of Agriculture Stipulates Silkworm Egg Prices</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, it is estimated that there will be about 600,000 sheets of silkworm eggs for autumn use in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year, and they can be taken from the warehouse for acid soaking and incubation in the middle of next month. All prices of these silkworm eggs have been stipulated by the Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee: (1) New variety of silkworm eggs: 35,000 yuan per sheet, actually collected from farmers at 25,000 yuan. (2) Old variety of silkworm eggs: 25,000 yuan per sheet, actually collected from farmers at 18,000 yuan. (3) The above regulations may be appropriately adjusted in case of drastic price changes. The production amount distributed and the prescribed price will be subsidized by the provincial governments from the improvement fees collected during the silkworm season. Furthermore, silkworm egg farms in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and other provinces can produce 550,000 sheets of silkworm eggs this autumn, requiring loans of 15,000 yuan per sheet, totaling 8.25 billion yuan. The Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee will negotiate with the Four Joint Offices and the Central Agricultural Bank for loans.</p>

<h3>The Pig Bristle Processing Industry Association Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Passed the Constitution and Elected Directors and Supervisors</h3>

More than 100 member representatives attended, representing 97 member units. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to attend and provide guidance, and delivered speeches respectively.

<h3>The Export Volume of North China's Specialty Pig Bristles Has Sharply Decreased</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Pig bristles are a major export commodity in North China, with those produced in the nine northeastern provinces being of superior quality. Due to the cold weather in the north and the abundance of miscellaneous grains, the feed is better, and the bristles are long, stiff, and elastic. According to folk customs, pigs are always slaughtered at the end of the year, so the period from October each year to June of the following year is the peak period for large shipments. Before the war, all European and American countries entrusted Tianjin foreign merchants to purchase on their behalf during this period. From March to June, the goods were collected and transported from the production areas to Tianjin and Pan Yang, packed into 50-kilogram wooden boxes, and shipped abroad by ship.</p>
<p>The trading procedures included delivery in Shenyang and export through Dalian, formerly known as "Dajiao," and delivery and export in Tianjin, known as "Tinjiao." Now that Dalian cannot be successfully received, all goods are concentrated in Tianjin. Before 1937, the annual export volume was generally around 50,000 boxes, with some surplus available for domestic manufacturers. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, when sea routes were not cut off, European and American countries competed to purchase, and trade was extremely prosperous. However, as the production areas fell one after another and the countryside was unsettled, production fell sharply. After Japan declared war on the United States, exports were interrupted, and the products were all purchased and sold by the Japanese. After the victory, the Communist army disrupted various places, and wars continued, and the villagers could not take care of themselves, so they had no energy to raise livestock. The production of pig bristles decreased accordingly, almost not reaching 30% of what it was before the war.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, the export volume of pig bristles in recent years is about three-fifths of the export volume before the war, and part of it is likely to be wartime inventory. If this continues, and new goods are not supplied, it will not be enough to meet domestic needs, let alone foreign countries. And advanced countries such as North America have invented substitutes, so the future of China's pig bristle exports is worrisome.</p>
<p>The export volume of pig bristles from January to June of the 36th year and October of the 35th year is as follows: In October of the 35th year, there were a total of 32,131 boxes, worth 3,266,653,704 yuan, imported and exported to the United States, Britain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Australia. In November, there were 2,580 boxes, worth 2,831,368,705 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, Sweden, and Hong Kong. In December, there were 2,392 boxes, worth 5,781,185,644 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, and Belgium. In June of the 36th year, there were more than 2,000 boxes in total, worth 1,449,918,829 yuan. In February, there were 864 boxes, worth 1,578,369,729 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Belgium, Australia, and France. In March, there were 2,065 boxes, worth 9,902,391,108 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, Switzerland, Belgium, and Sweden. In April, there were 4,644 boxes, worth 21,290,617,110 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, Sweden, Hong Kong, and Belgium. In May, there were 2,820 boxes, worth 12,119,838,389 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In June, there were 2,865 boxes, worth 13,076,442,076 yuan, to the United States, Britain, Australia, and France.</p>
<h3>The New Stamp Tax Rate Will Be Implemented Starting August 1st</h3>
<p>The Banking Association Stipulates Four Points to Inform Colleagues to Handle</p>
<p>The revised Stamp Tax Law has been promulgated and implemented by the National Government on June 6th of this year. The tax bureau has announced that starting August 1st, the new tax rate table must be strictly implemented. Because of many doubts in the annotations listed in the categories of the tax rate table, the Shanghai Banking Association proposed it through the Banking Association, and after a meeting decision, it was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for instructions and issued to colleagues for attention to unify the handling of the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) When entrusted by a branch in another location to collect money from a customer in a certain place, the receipt issued to the customer will not be stamped according to the second item (Money Receipt), but according to the eleventh item (Exchange Document), each piece will be stamped with a stamp tax ticket of 20,000 yuan. (Reason) The annotation column of the second item of the tax rate table has a proviso stating that documents related to interbank collection that are purely exchange-related between financial institutions may be stamped according to the provisions of the eleventh item of this table.</p>
<p>(2) When a bank collects tuition fees on behalf of a school, the school's receipt should be stamped, but the school issuing the receipt must bear the stamp tax.</p>
<p>(3) The document issued by the bank to the customer for receiving pledged items should be stamped with 50,000 yuan per piece according to the thirteenth item (Deposit Document).</p>
<p>(4) The document issued by the bank to the customer for receiving various deposits should be stamped with 20,000 yuan per piece according to the eleventh item (Deposit Receipt). (Reason) The deposit is temporarily kept on behalf of the customer and will be returned in the future, so its nature is the same as a deposit.</p>
<h3>Kaohsiung Port Enters a New Phase; To Be Developed as an International Trade Port; The Government Decides to Allocate Compensation Materials for Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 27th] Since the National Shipping Conference unanimously requested that Kaohsiung Port be developed as an international trade port, the status of Kaohsiung Port has entered a new stage. According to Lin Zebin, director of the Kaohsiung Port Authority, who attended this National Shipping Conference, his proposal to designate the port as an international commercial port was approved and sent to the Ministry of Communications for review. Lin stated: Kaohsiung Port directly affects our national defense economy, because many important factories of the Resources Commission are concentrated in Kaohsiung. Japan had planned to expand the area of Kaohsiung Port by five times to accommodate 100 10,000-ton ships. During the war, the United States had planned to expand Kaohsiung Port to accommodate 80 10,000-ton ships after occupying Taiwan. Today, we feel even more that the port must be restored.</p>
<p>Lin also stated that the government has decided to allocate cranes, dredging ships, and various machinery from compensation materials to assist the construction of Kaohsiung Port. Kaohsiung Port is 1,500 meters wide and 12 kilometers long. Except for the typhoon season from June to September, when there are showers, there is little rainfall in spring and winter, which is truly favored by heaven and earth. Originally, 10,000-ton ships could freely berth in the port, but the port is now more silted up. He has contacted the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to borrow dredging ships to assist in dredging. Currently, shipping at Kaohsiung Port is frequent and is becoming more prosperous.</p>
<h3>Current Salt Production in Northeast China Is Only Enough for Local Use</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Ni Haosen, director of the Northeast Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, recently came from Jin to Changchun to comfort the salt affairs personnel under his jurisdiction in Liaobei and Changji regions, who were harassed by the Communist bandits. When reporters inquired about the salt affairs issue in Northeast China, he said that during the enemy and puppet period, there were eight salt fields in Northeast China, with an annual output of about 36 million dan. After the restoration, due to damage and the chaos caused by the Communist bandits, only Yingkou and four salt fields in western Liaoning have been recovered by the National Army, totaling five places, with an annual output of about 16 to 17 million dan.</p>
<p>This year, Northeast China originally planned to export 2 million dan of salt, but due to various reasons, only 400,000 dan have been exported to Korea so far. In the future, if we want to export in large quantities, we can only wait for the National Army to recover the larger-scale salt fields such as Gaiping Fuxian Zhuanghe as soon as possible. Otherwise, given the current situation, it can only supply the needs of Northeast China and cannot be sold abroad. He added that the salt production in Northeast China accounts for about half of the country's total. If it can be improved and increased, the future will be limitless.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branch Weakens</h3>
<p>After the appearance of new Jinshan branches, a small number were offered at a price of 1.36 million yuan, but the company also has its own goods, and the selling price is softer. The market seems difficult to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Bank Weekly Publication</h3>
<p>The Bank Weekly, edited by Zhu Sihuang, has recently published a combined issue for the 28th and 29th issues of the 31st volume. This issue is a special issue on banking practices, including reports from the Banking Association's Banking Practices Research Conference, covering ten practical and difficult questions discussed and resolved in the Personnel, Safe Deposit Box, and Trust groups.

<p>The reform of Japan's land system is the foundation of Japan's democratization. The extent of land system reform reflects the progress of Japan's democratization. Japan's rural areas have always been a breeding ground for conservative forces and the core of reactionary forces and the military. Japan's land system has strong feudal characteristics. Since the Meiji Restoration, the people have had no freedom to access land. Vast lands are occupied by large landlords, state-owned lands, and imperial estates (御料地). Only 16% of the national land area is arable. As a result, the living standards of farmers are low, and workers have to accept low wages. Therefore, Japan's capitalism has a very small domestic market, insufficient purchasing power among the people, and must seek markets abroad for surplus goods, practicing dumping, which led to imperialist expansionist behavior.</p>
<p>Land Reform from Top to Bottom</p>
<p>Due to the contradictions of this land system, tenant farmer resistance movements occurred in the valleys of Japan during World War I, leading to the rise of right-wing thought, culminating in the May 15 Incident (May 15, 1930), the assassination of Prime Minister Hamaguchi, and the February 26 Incident (February 26, 1936), the attack on the Prime Minister's official residence by the Konoe Guards. At this time, Japanese imperialism should have addressed the land issue, but under the pretext of overpopulation, it shifted the target of popular resistance to foreign wars of aggression. It created the September 18 Incident in our country and further expanded it into the Pacific War, which eventually buried the Japanese Empire.</p>
<p>The result of defeat was the demand for land system reform, coupled with food shortages and the increasing number of repatriates, and the calls for land reform grew louder. Although this demand had gradually grown in Japan, its power was very weak. The old forces, attempting to maintain the old system and entrenched in various places, were still very strong. Without external pressure, land reform would be difficult to implement. Therefore, MacArthur repeatedly instructed the Japanese government to implement land system reform as soon as possible, the so-called top-down reform.</p>
<p>MacArthur Directs Implementation of Reform</p>
<p>On November 12, 1945, MacArthur's headquarters, after instructing the dissolution of the zaibatsu, ordered the Japanese government to abolish the current agricultural land system that placed farmers and their families in a state of slavery. At that time, the Shidehara Cabinet submitted the "Revised Agricultural Land Adjustment Law" to the 89th Japanese Parliament in November 1945, which was promulgated and implemented in February 1946. This is called the "First Agricultural Land System Reform." However, MacArthur's headquarters was still dissatisfied with the reform and sent a "Memorandum on Agricultural Land Reform" to the Japanese government on December 9, 1945, pointing out the points that should be improved and ordering the Japanese government to submit a new reform plan by March 15. Subsequently, on May 29, 1946, at the Sixth Council for Japan, the Japanese government's new plan was discussed, and the British representative submitted a "Draft on Agricultural Land System Reform." During the meeting, it was recognized that the Japanese government's first agricultural land system reform was completely inconsistent with the purpose of the directive, and recommendations for modifications were made. Based on these recommendations, the Japanese government drafted a bill and submitted to the 90th Parliament the "Revised Agricultural Land Adjustment Act Again" and the "Special Measures Law for the Creation and Maintenance of Owner-Farmers," which is the second agricultural land system reform. Regarding the progress of the second reform, a dispute arose among the representatives of various countries at the recent 35th (June 25) Council for Japan, believing that the progress of land reform was not smooth enough. Let us see how the US side responded.</p>
<p>Reform Goal is to Abolish Tenancy</p>
<p>According to the report by Bader, the head of the Economics Section of the Agriculture Division of the Natural Resources Bureau of MacArthur's headquarters, he said: (1) The goal of the Japanese government's agricultural land reform plan is to eradicate the exploitative tenancy system based on the democratic line of the Allied occupation's general objectives. The legal basis for this plan is (1) the "Special Measures Law for the Creation of Owner-Farmers" and (2) the "Revised Agricultural Land Adjustment Law," whose main purpose is to 1 purchase most of the cultivated land owned by landlords; 2 then resell the purchased cultivated land to tenant farmers who engage in cultivation; (2) This plan intends to purchase approximately 500 acres of cultivated land. This cultivated land is scattered in the hands of 5.5 million farm households in the form of countless small plots. The Japanese government is currently engaged in purchasing the land, intending to re-divide the purchased land into economic units suitable for agricultural management and transfer them to individual tenant farmers. The transfer work will be completed on December 31, 1948. (3) The basic agricultural land reform law was passed by the Japanese Parliament on October 11, 1946, and promulgated on October 20. According to this regulation, all farm households with more than one tan (0.245 acres) of agricultural land or cultivated land, and their direct family members over the age of 20, should be divided into landlords, owner-farmers, and tenant farmers, and registration should be completed by November 30, 1946. Furthermore, city and village agricultural land committees should be organized, composed of democratically elected members. This election should begin in December 1946 and end on December 31. The city and village agricultural land committees should be composed of five representatives of tenant farmers, three representatives of landlords, and two representatives of owner-farmers. The members of the prefectural agricultural land committees should be mutually elected from the city and village agricultural land committees and should be completed by February 25, 1947. The members of the Central Agricultural Land Committee should be appointed by the cabinet on March 26, 1947. (4) The city and village agricultural land committees are responsible for promoting agricultural land reform, and the government should try its best to avoid interference. The city and village agricultural land committees should formulate agricultural land purchase plans for each city and village and examine the qualifications of purchasers of agricultural land. The prefectural agricultural land committees serve as a mechanism for landlords and owner-farmers to appeal if they are dissatisfied. Within the general policies and objectives determined by the Central Agricultural Land Committee, the prefectural policies are determined. The composition, character, and activities of these agricultural land committees are all subject to specific legal regulations. (5) The general function of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is to ensure that farmers comply with the agricultural land reform law and protect the public interest. The agricultural land division within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is the agency directly responsible for implementing the agricultural land reform plan. Six agricultural land divisions are established in various locations to conduct voter registration, manage agricultural land committee elections, and establish agencies for purchasing and transferring agricultural land.</p>
<p>Reform Center Divided into Two Points</p>
<p>The important points of the agricultural land system reform plan can be divided into two. The first point is to purchase the cultivated land leased out by landlords to establish owner-farmers. The first and revised Agricultural Land Adjustment Act stipulates that the area of ​​land retained by landlords is 5 cho (1 cho is 2.45 acres), and the area to be purchased is only 950,000 cho. The second reform draft stipulates that the land area owned by non-cultivating landlords is 1 cho, and the cultivated land owned by self-cultivating landlords is 3 cho, and the area of ​​cultivated land to be purchased is approximately 2 million cho (approximately 500 acres), reaching 80% of the total area of ​​tenant-farmed land. The second point is rent, changing from in-kind payment to cash payment. The existing in-kind rent contracts should be converted to cash payment based on a standard of 75 yen per stone of brown rice (1 Japanese stone is 4.9629 bushels). The first reform plan stipulated that agricultural associations would be responsible for land acquisition and redistribution, while the second agricultural land reform law changed it to the state handling it, and the completion deadline was shortened from five years to two years.</p>
<p>Liberating Tenant Farmers and Eradicating Feudalism</p>
<p>According to the opinion of Japanese progressive economist and Tokyo University professor, Hyoe Ouchi, the greatest significance of this reform plan is that it changes tenancy from in-kind payment to cash payment. Because in-kind tenancy takes away more than half of the farmers' income, causing Japanese farmers to forever sink into a miserable state, taking away the funds for improving management from their hands, and turning them into low-wage springs, forcing farmers to rely on sideline income to maintain their lives. This law has brought about a major change in the basic social relations in Japanese villages, needless to say, because tenant farmers have gained a more advantageous and freer position as agricultural operators. In this sense, they have also been greatly liberated in relation to landlords, and the eradication of feudal colors from rural areas is indeed a progressive legislation.</p>
<p>Reform Progress Leading to Delay</p>
<p>What is the current situation of land reform? The Japanese government originally planned to purchase 500,000 cho of agricultural land by the end of December of this year, but the actual amount of land purchased was only 158,000 cho, reaching 31.6% of the planned target. The inherent reason for this lies in the technical difficulties encountered in the implementation of the law. In reality, the power of landlords representing conservative forces in rural areas is still deeply rooted, hindering the process. Most of the 158,000 cho of cultivated land purchased belongs to landlords who do not live in rural areas. It is expected that greater difficulties will be encountered in the second phase (starting from July 2) when purchasing land owned by landlords living in villages. There have been widespread reports in Japanese news about landlords superficially complying with and secretly opposing the agricultural land reform work, not only forcibly taking back leased cultivated land from tenant farmers or concluding secret rental contracts, collecting extra-legal high rents, but also directly threatening tenant farmers with violence. What the landlord class hopes is to take back the land from tenant farmers for self-cultivation, or nominally adopt the method of self-cultivation, but secretly lease it to others, obtain high rents, and preserve the landlord's management model. According to a survey by the Japan National Agricultural Association, villages and towns where landlords forcibly took back cultivated land from tenant farmers and hindered land reform accounted for nearly 50.8% of the country. Recently, the landlords' offensive has become more intense. For example, landlords in Makabe District, Ibaraki Prefecture, organized gangs to snipe tenant farmers. As for what the tenant farmers hope for, according to a survey of 563 villages and towns by the National Agricultural Association, 73.5% hoped to purchase land. It can be seen that the influence of the character of the city and village agricultural land committees in rural areas on land reform is very significant. According to regulations, democratic elections should be carried out, but those established without voting procedures accounted for nearly 45%. Most of them are composed of committee members recommended by landlords who occupy very important positions in rural areas, using the names of agricultural associations and official agencies. The representatives of tenant farmers are also mostly influenced by landlords. The proportional composition of the class of chairmen of the agricultural land committees in each city and village under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo Agricultural Land Affairs Bureau can give a glimpse into the power of the landlords. The proportion is as follows:</p>
<p>Tenant Farmer Association President 25%</p>
<p>Landlord Association President 36%</p>
<p>Owner-Farmer Association President 37%</p>
<p>Neutral Association President 2%</p>
<p>Self-cultivating farmers, especially those who are not members of farmers' associations, mostly stand with the landlords and support the landlords. Based on the above table, it can be estimated that 75% of the agricultural land committees nationwide can be said to have the character of landlords, showing the strength of the parasitic landlord forces. Because Japanese rural areas have traditionally been the core of conservatives, reactionary forces, and the military in the domestic system, agricultural land reform, in terms of its spirit and scale, can be said to be an act of peaceful revolution. Whether this plan will be fully realized depends on the self-awareness and organizational power of Japanese farmers.</p>
<p>Plan to be Completed Next March</p>
<p>Japan's agricultural land reform work entered the second phase on July 2. The first phase ended at the end of March this year, and the land purchased was all owned by landlords who did not live in rural areas. The land to be purchased in the second phase is the uncultivated land owned by landlords living in the villages, which accounts for approximately 226,000 acres. Most of the land owned by these landlords will be subject to purchase, with only 2.5 acres, or 1 cho, allowed to be retained. However, in Hokkaido, where there is a lot of wasteland, 10 acres are allowed to be retained. According to Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano's reply to Senator Shoji Touura in the Senate on the 2nd, "The Japanese government purchased 150,000 cho of cultivated land by the end of March of this year. It is estimated that 160,000 cho will be purchased by the end of July, 180,000 cho by the end of October, 310,000 cho by the end of December, 180,000 cho by the end of February next year, and 240,000 cho by the end of March. In total, 1.22 million cho of cultivated land will be purchased by the government and transferred to owner-farmers. After the second agricultural land system reform is completed, the first reform will be started.</p>
<p>Rural Problems Still Need to be Solved</p>
<p>What changes will occur in Japanese rural society after this reform? According to the opinion of Hyoe Ouchi, after this reform, not all tenant farmers in Japanese rural areas will become owner-farmers, and the scale of operation of farm households that have acquired cultivated land will not be expanded. He said, "After the enactment of this plan, there will be no difference in the scale of operation in Japanese rural areas compared to the past, and it will still be a small-farmer rural area. On the one hand, there are many owner-farmers, and on the other hand, there are still many tenant farmers with small-scale operations, forming an oriental-style village." At the same time, this reform did not mention the vast state-owned land and imperial estates (御料地). Of the 38 million cho of land area in mainland Japan, approximately 19 million cho belong to the state, public, and imperial estates owned by the Emperor, accounting for 50% of the national land area. The current plan to purchase 2 million cho of cultivated land is a very small proportion, truly a drop in the bucket, and does not solve the fundamental problem. Secondly, regarding the issue of the tax burden on Japanese farmers, the taxes currently paid by Japanese farmers to the government are too heavy. Taking income tax as an example, the agricultural income tax paid by Japanese farmers is three times higher than the labor income tax paid by the general public. These are still rural problems that Japan urgently needs to solve.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Historical Sites: Kaiyuan Ancient Temple</h3>
<p>The temple is a Tang Dynasty relic and one of the famous scenic spots in the city. The exterior is simple and solemn, and the interior is lined with Buddha statues. The project is exquisite and lifelike. (Photo taken in Xi'an by Li Chi, reporter of this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Chang'an · Xi'an · Xijing</h3>
<p>— Reporter of this Newspaper, Zhang Xianzhou</p>
<p>Xijing City, 24th (Airmail)</p>
<p>On the plateau of the Northwest, a city with a population of more than 600,000 is indeed too small. People who have traveled through Lanzhou and Dihua always say, "Xi'an is still better!" when they come back.</p>
<p>In the administrative organization of the Qing Dynasty, Xi'an was a prefecture. Xi'an urban area and the near suburbs were administered by Chang'an and Xianning counties. In the early years of the Republic of China, the prefecture system was abolished, and provinces were established. In the third year of the Republic of China, in accordance with the national plan for merging the first counties in each province, Xianning and Chang'an counties were merged into the first county of Shaanxi. The county name remained Chang'an. The county government was located on West Street in the city. In the twenty-third year, the national government designated Xi'an as the auxiliary capital, renamed it Xijing, and established the Xijing Municipal Preparatory Committee, appointing Mr. Zhang Puquan as the chairman to prepare for the business of Xijing's directly-administered municipality. After the July 7th Incident, due to national affairs and the Japanese invasion, the ancient city of Xi'an suffered multiple bombings, and changing to a directly-administered municipality was only a term on the map.</p>
<p>New Plan of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>After the victory, Shaanxi Province first established Xi'an as a province-administered city, named "Xi'an," to show its distinction from Xijing. It was not until this spring that it was changed to a directly-administered municipality. Some people say that Chang'an represents the period from military administration to political tutelage, Xi'an is the product of demobilization, and Xijing should symbolize unity and constitutional government. The establishment of the new municipal government coincides with the national election period.</p>
<p>According to the plan of the Xijing Preparatory Committee, the urban area extends east to Baqiao, south to the Zhongnan Mountains, north to the Wei River, and west to Sanqiao. With this division, most of Chang'an County's jurisdiction was划去了. The reporter recently visited the Shaanxi Provincial authorities for this purpose. It is said that the provincial government intends to apply to the Executive Yuan to abolish Chang'an County, and transfer all the county's land, population, and jurisdiction to Xijing City. If this is successful, the area of Xijing City will be approximately 12,800 square kilometers.</p>
<p>Population Growth and City Prosperity</p>
<p>The gradual prosperity of Xijing can be clearly seen from the increase in population: in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Xi'an had only 154,540 people. By October of the twenty-seventh year, it reached 277,965. According to the latest statistics, it is approximately 620,000 people. Now, if we add the population of Chang'an, the number should be much larger.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a common problem in Chinese cities: the production level is still handicraft industry, while the consumption level has reached the latest fashion. Xi'an is no exception. Currently, there is only light industry, and no heavy industry to speak of. Among them, the larger ones are the Dahua Shenxin textile mills, and the Yongfeng Taihua flour mills are considered to be the largest in scale.</p>
<p>Inflexible Transportation</p>
<p>Xi'an is a city without large rivers. In terms of transportation, it generally seems convenient, but in fact, it is still inconvenient. Airplanes are a tool for a few people. The Longhai Railway has more passengers than trains. Every train that departs and arrives daily is mostly crowded. Even second-class cars give people the feeling of "no room to stand." As for materials, they are even less smooth. Tongchuan, 300 miles north of the city, has mountains of coal piled up, but it cannot be transported out. The price of coal in Xi'an is more than ten times higher than the original price on the mine. Ask the people at the mine! In a word, "No wagons! What can be done?"</p>
<p>Expensive Tuition in the Education Sector</p>
<p>In terms of education, Xi'an has three specialized colleges, five provincial middle schools, twenty-two private middle schools, three normal schools, seven vocational middle schools, seventy-eight public and private primary schools, and National Northwest University. However, public schools are small in scale and have limited enrollment. Private schools are not only mostly poorly equipped, but also charge exorbitant tuition fees. Currently, it is said that middle school tuition fees will be 400,000 yuan next semester, with an additional note: "More refunds and fewer supplements." In fact, there have always been students who "supplement less," and the school has never "refunded more." In today's rising prices, it is not easy for ordinary citizens to make a living, and many people "sigh in vain for learning"! As for the National Library, it is currently under preparation, and it is said that even the site is still "under planning." The new books in the provincial Xijing Library seem to be too few. Although the Stele Forest is good, there are not many tourists, the door is deserted, and bird droppings are everywhere, which looks a bit out of place.</p>
<p>Enlightened New Municipal Administration</p>
<p>When Xi'an was changed to a directly-administered municipality, many people said, "Xi'an's funding is a problem. Its income is not high, and it is not comparable to Shanghai, Tianjin, Pinghan. It is feared that there will be a difficult hurdle in future municipal facilities." Mayor Wang Youzhi is a kind person who is tall and plump. He has worked in journalism in the past and presided over Shaanxi education. He has always been good to his colleagues in the news industry. Whenever you visit him, you can go straight to him without having to report three times. When he first took office as the mayor of Xijing, the reporter made a special visit. He only humbly said, "There is not enough information now, so I am researching it and cannot talk about the so-called 'grand plan.' In short, future governance must be enlightened? There will be no undisclosed matters...". His temper is really straightforward.</p>
<p>From Simplicity to Luxury</p>
<p>Xi'an's style is a city in transition from simplicity to luxury. On the streets here, the great cloth gray wartime uniforms of female students and the glass clothes of the United States reflect each other. In the Chenghuang Temple on West Street, you can buy old-fashioned canes carved with dragon heads, white copper water pipe... At the same time, you can see glass handbags and foreign-flavored knick-knacks in the Shangren Road East Street area. July 17 (the first day of the sixth lunar month) is the ancient fair of Nantai Mountain (80 miles south of the city), and the residents of Xijing City are still drums and music, burning incense and paper, kneeling in the temple and chanting in a low voice: "Great mercy and compassion—Guanshiyin—Bodhisattva." This should be 相映成趣 with the ladies sitting in the cinema humming "The night is deep, the embroidery needle has stopped!...".</p>
<p>There are eleven newspapers, only one of which is an evening newspaper. It is said that several more will be published soon. It is hoped that there will be more "good" ones. Currently, only one abstract publication, "Book and Newspaper Essence," remains, and it has been published for more than 30 issues without interruption. In the entire Northwest, this is probably the only flower!</p>
<p>Department Stores are Doing Good Business</p>
<p>The gold shop industry in the business world was once the darling of heaven, extremely popular for a time, but since the gold freeze, it has become increasingly depressed. It is said that more than half of them have already closed down. On the other hand, department stores are still doing good business. Consignment shops have begun to go "downhill" and are no longer as prosperous as they used to be. Generally speaking, Xijing is not much worse than Shanghai in terms of consumption appetite. Therefore, many goods are often more expensive in Shanghai than in Xi'an. Sometimes the goods in Xi'an are cheaper than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wishing the Ancient City More Prosperity</p>
<p>Summers in Xi'an are very hot. Although the streets are often sprinkled with water by shops, there is still a lot of dust. But Xi'an's summer has its mood. On the grass of Revolution Park after dusk, you will see pairs of young men and women, or a young couple, leading their child "one and a half" to take a slow stroll. There is quite a bit of "leisurely" spirit. Even the "dry lake bank" of the "Lotus Lake Park" with "no lotus and no water" is usually full of guests. If you ask what they are doing? There is nothing to see, but so many people, in Xi'an dialect, "relaxing!"</p>
<p>From Chang'an to Xi'an, and then to Xijing, it is progress. I think that in the process of nation-building, the ancient city should be more prosperous and more lovely!</p>

<h3>WEEKLY FORUM BASIC CONCEPTS OF ETHICAL CONSTRUCTION</h3>
<p>— Chen Baohua</p>
<p>The definition of the word "倫" (lún) originally meant classes and ranks; "倫理" (lúnlǐ, ethics) is the principle of relationships between people. The concepts that a person develops toward those they come into contact with, the majority of people, or humanity as a whole are ethical concepts. The study of this principle of relationships between people and the concepts it produces is ethics.</p>
<p>The relationships between people vary according to each person's position and inherent conditions. If centered on the individual, he can have various relationships with others, such as above, below, before, behind, left, and right. Relationships with those above are with parents and ancestors; relationships with those below are with children and grandchildren; relationships with elders or those with more knowledge and experience are those that come before; relationships with the young or those with less knowledge and experience are those that come after; relationships with those of the same rank, such as classmates, are relationships on the left and right. The so-called Five Relationships of the past, such as ruler and subject, father and son, husband and wife, siblings, and friends, are different representations of ethical relationships. Within these different relationships, intricate and complex relationships can arise, such as when someone is older but has less knowledge, or when someone is young but more knowledgeable. Due to these complex relationships, the concepts produced toward others also vary in importance, depth, and superficiality. However, broadly speaking, "generation," "age," and "knowledge" are the three most important factors in ethical concepts. The relative importance of these factors, with distinctions between before and after, determines the starting point and differences in ethical concepts.</p>
<p>1.  Reasons for the emergence of ethical concepts</p>
<p>The reasons for the emergence of ethical concepts can be broadly divided into three aspects:</p>
<p>First, it stems from innate conscience. From birth, an infant will inevitably develop feelings and impressions of affection and love for the closest parents or caregivers. The word "孝" (xiào, filial piety) is the most natural ethical concept that arises from human nature. Secondly, respect for the elderly and those with superior knowledge is also a naturally generated concept. Extending this further, compassion for all of humanity, even animals, also arises from innate conscience and produces the ethical concept of "仁愛" (rén'ài, benevolence and love). These all stem from conscience.</p>
<p>Second, it stems from wisdom. As people live in social groups, they gradually develop the concept of shared interests, knowing that for their own benefit, they must also consider the interests of others. By not harming the interests of others, they can consistently maintain their own interests. When the interests of most people increase, their own interests will inevitably increase as well. This concept of shared interests can be said to arise from human wisdom. Each person's sense of responsibility also arises from this enlightenment of wisdom, based on the concept of shared interests. Words like "信" (xìn, trustworthiness), "義" (yì, righteousness), "和" (hé, harmony), and "平" (píng, peace) can be said to be synonymous with this concept.</p>
<p>Third, it stems from artificial teaching. Under the systems of monarchical states and patriarchal societies, the words "忠孝" (zhōngxiào, loyalty and filial piety) became axioms of morality, which everyone must strictly adhere to. Based on this highest principle, various laws and regulations were formulated to ensure the stable existence of this social system. The so-called "Heaven, Earth, Ruler, Parents, Teacher" were each person's sole benefactors, enshrined with tablets and worshipped daily, with the "Ruler" at the center, and Heaven, Earth, Parents, and Teacher merely serving as accompaniments. Due to these methods of teaching and legal systems, each person's ethical concepts were strengthened, deepened, and distorted. Therefore, "禮教" (lǐjiào, ritual and moral teachings) became a tool used by the ruling class to oppress the common people and maintain the social system of monarchical rule and patriarchy. In fact, from an academic perspective, the words "忠孝" (zhōngxiào, loyalty and filial piety) are the purest ethical concepts, arising from conscience and wisdom. When a person lives within the large group of a nation and people, being loyal to the monarch or leader is also due to the concept of shared interests, and is also a sense of responsibility. The monarch or leader is the central representative of a large organization, and being loyal to them is for the common good. "孝" (xiào, filial piety) is, of course, the most natural ethical concept arising from innate conscience. When a person knows that their body and life are bestowed by their parents, how can they not naturally feel the desire to be filial and serve them? The stories of the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars in China are all moving and praiseworthy, expressing the purest and most sublime form of morality. Now that the systems of monarchical despotism and patriarchal society have been reformed, and social organizations are moving towards the goal of democratic constitutionalism, the words "忠孝" (zhōngxiào, loyalty and filial piety) should still be the highest standard of ethics and morality.</p>
<p>2.  Relativity of Ethical Concepts and Sense of Responsibility</p>
<p>Ethical relationships are relative, so ethical concepts are also relative. In China, even before the Three Dynasties (Xia, Shang, Zhou), this relative relationship between people was emphasized. Confucius further promoted the theory of the relativity of ethical relationships, culminating in a complete ethical philosophy. The most important point is his ability to recognize the relativity of ethical relationships. The so-called "君君臣臣父父子子" (jūnjūn chénchén fùfù zǐzǐ, "Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject be a subject, the father be a father, and the son be a son"), meaning that each should fulfill their position and responsibility, thereby upholding their proper ethical concepts. If the ruler does not act according to the way of a ruler, then the subject will not observe the etiquette of a subject. The saying "君不君，臣不臣，父不父，子不子" (jūnbùjūn chénbùchén fùbùfù zǐbùzǐ, "If the ruler is not a ruler, the subject is not a subject, the father is not a father, and the son is not a son"), then the world will be in chaos, and social order will naturally be destroyed. Mr. Zhu Bólu (朱伯廬) said, "倫常乖舛，立見消亡" (lúncháng guāichuǎn, lìjiàn xiāowáng, "When ethical principles are violated, destruction is immediately seen"), which is the same principle. To consistently maintain good ethical relationships, we must emphasize the principle of relativity. Not only must we maintain the proper etiquette, attitude, and service responsibility towards the other party, but the other party must also maintain their proper attitude and responsibility. This effort is what past sages and worthies have always praised. As for so-called blind loyalty and blind filial piety, they are universally criticized and opposed. For a subject, to make their ruler and father become wise rulers and virtuous fathers is the most remarkable accomplishment. Under this relative ethical concept, teaching people to do good also becomes a responsibility and a merit. This kind of teaching, based on the relative perspective of common interests, aligns with the principles of normal ethics and morality.</p>
<p>The relationship between people, starting from the individual, may be from close to distant, from near to far, from small to large; but from the perspective of the entire human group, the individual is the "small self" (小我, xiǎo wǒ), and the group is the "large self" (大我, dà wǒ). The "small self" is entrusted within the "large self." The importance of the existence of the "large self" is truly many times higher than that of the "small self," so the inherent meaning of the "small self" is small, while its meaning for the existence of the "large self" is large. This is the sense of responsibility and obligation generated from the concept of shared interests. Furthermore, starting from the individual's conscience, a person can naturally develop compassion for others, often serving others out of sympathy, even willing to sacrifice themselves to rescue others and strive for common interests, thereby maintaining the existence of the "large self." The so-called "殺身成仁，捨身取義" (shāshēn chéngrén, shěshēn qǔyì, "Sacrificing one's life to achieve benevolence, giving up one's life to take righteousness") is a proper expression of this concept. We should not only focus on the ethical relationships between individuals, but also ignore the ethical responsibilities of the individual to the nation, people, society, and humanity. The so-called "仁" (rén, benevolence), "義" (yì, righteousness), "忠" (zhōng, loyalty), "勇" (yǒng, courage), etc., emphasize the responsibility of the "small self" to the "large self."</p>
<p>3.  Maintenance and Destruction of Ethical Relationships</p>
<p>If we want to maintain good ethical relationships between individuals, there are two words worth following. Zengzi (曾子) said: "夫子之道，忠恕而已矣" (Fūzǐ zhī dào, zhōngshù éryǐ yǐ, "The Master's way is nothing but loyalty and forbearance"). These two words, "忠恕" (zhōngshù, loyalty and forbearance), are indeed the essence of Confucius's ethical philosophy. "忠" (zhōng, loyalty) is my personal sincere and earnest intention towards others and the attitude it expresses, developing into a service-oriented perspective and a sense of responsibility. "恕" (shù, forbearance) is forgiving others for their inappropriate behaviors and attitudes, with the intention of correcting and remedying normal ethical relationships, preventing them from further deterioration and destruction. Because its purpose is to maintain ethical relationships, it does not take retaliatory measures, but takes a forgiving attitude. "恕" (shù, forbearance) is an active method, not a passive response. The application of "恕" (shù, forbearance) is limited. It should only be applied in certain situations and to a certain extent; beyond this limit, it is unacceptable. The ancients considered the limit beyond which the other party is unforgivable before taking the step of breaking off relations. The purpose of the two words "忠恕" (zhōngshù, loyalty and forbearance) is to maintain the ethical relationships between people.</p>
<p>In order to maintain good ethical relationships, we must also pay attention to the Doctrine of the Mean. First, we must talk about the word "愛" (ài, love). The starting point of love is certainly good; but loving in the wrong way, such as doting, favoritism, and indulgence, can undermine the other party's position, causing them to do inappropriate things, thereby destroying ethical relationships and even social order. Although it is called love, it is actually harming them. Therefore, the word "愛" (ài, love) cannot be abused. Regarding the issue of repaying kindness and resentment, it should also not be excessive. Repaying kindness with kindness is natural, but repaying resentment with kindness is unnecessary and should be changed to "以直報怨" (yǐ zhí bàoyuàn, repaying resentment with straightforwardness) to be moderate. As for repaying kindness with resentment, it is extremely wrong. Generally, people hate and despise those who are ungrateful, which is also due to the reason of being abnormal and contrary to reason. Third, an attitude that is too respectful and tends to flattery is also unacceptable. Confucius said: "巧言令色，鮮矣仁!" (qiǎoyán lìngsè, xiǎn yǐ rén!, "Those who are clever with their words and put on a flattering appearance rarely have benevolence!"). Therefore, those who specialize in flattery today have lost the inherent nature of benevolence and are not allowed in ethics and morality. Confucius emphasized the Doctrine of the Mean, saying that both excess and deficiency are "不仁" (bùrén, lack of benevolence). We can see this from the Spring and Autumn Annals, which discusses principles based on events.</p>
<p>Here, we want to talk about the abnormality and causes of destruction of human relationships. In the past, Mencius advocated human nature is inherently good, while Xunzi advocated human nature is inherently evil. The policies of ruling the world between Confucianism and Legalism also differed. Gradually, everyone discussed the issue of love and hate, which is closely related to ethical philosophy and is a fundamental and major issue. As mentioned above, compassion arises from human conscience, and a sense of responsibility based on the concept of shared interests arises from human wisdom. This can explain that human nature is inherently good and should be able to consistently maintain good ethical relationships between people; however, why does human nature become evil?</p>
<p>First, it is due to desire. A person's desire to survive is innate, but their initial goal is towards things, not people. When there is no lack of supply of things in nature or artificial obstacles, the normal relationship between people will not be destroyed. Therefore, the innate nature of the desire to survive alone cannot be said to be evil. When a person's desire exceeds the limit of survival and develops into harming others to benefit oneself and satisfy private desires, their personality and wisdom have already been infiltrated by acquired social factors. However, these acquired social factors can still be corrected by artificial methods and forces, preventing the individual's desires from developing arbitrarily, hindering the interests of others, and thus destroying ethical relationships.</p>
<p>Second, it is due to revenge and hatred. Human nature is originally good, and everyone has compassion and sympathy; however, due to the flaws in the social system, if an individual has been oppressed and their survival becomes a problem, it will naturally cause their resentment and generate feelings of hatred and resentment, which of course arise from artificial causes. If we want to maintain good ethical relationships, prevent human nature from becoming evil, and restore it to goodness, we must strive to improve the social system, so that laws and policies conform to the principles of common welfare and equal survival, preventing some people from seizing the interests of others, eliminating the relationship of enslavement and exploitation, and then eliminating the phenomenon of contradiction and conflict. So-called "和平" (hépíng, peace) must first be "平" (píng, equal) and then "和" (hé, harmony), which lays the foundation for true ethical construction.</p>
<p>4.  Social Construction and the Function of the Four Cardinal Virtues</p>
<p>Ethical construction aims to maintain normal and good relationships between people, and under the principle of joint cooperation, to build a peaceful, progressive, and civilized society, and increase the happiness of human life. Therefore, ethical construction is also the foundation of social construction. When we talk about the five constructions, namely psychological construction, ethical construction, social construction, political construction, and economic construction, social construction is actually the central construction of the five constructions. The other four constructions are all coordinated with the needs of social construction. If social construction has a sound, good, complete, and dynamic foundation, then human happiness will naturally increase day by day. So-called political construction and economic construction should all take steps and methods towards this central goal, and all efforts are adapted to social construction. Psychological construction and ethical construction start from the individual's personality and moral concepts to establish good relationships between people and strive to serve the "large self" by sacrificing the "small self," all for the needs of social construction. In particular, ethical construction is the foundation of social construction and has a closer relationship. Now we want to talk about the arguments and functions of the concepts of the Four Cardinal Virtues: "禮" (lǐ, ritual), "義" (yì, righteousness), "廉" (lián, integrity), and "恥" (chǐ, shame).</p>
<p>"禮" (lǐ, ritual) is a polite attitude of people towards each other, used to maintain social order. As mentioned above, the relationship between people can produce different ethical concepts from the differences in the relationship of up, down, front, back, left, and right, and thus produce different polite attitudes. For example, father to son, son to father, ruler to subject, subject to ruler, husband to wife, wife to husband, teacher to student, and student to teacher all produce their proper polite attitudes due to the different relationships. This word "禮" (lǐ, ritual) is used to maintain normal and good ethical relationships, which is to maintain normal and good social order. In addition to starting with the polite attitude between individuals, the meaning and function of "禮" (lǐ, ritual) is also expressed from the aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Extending this further, in public gatherings, etiquette and rules that are commonly observed are set, such as weddings, funerals, celebrations, and various banquets, all of which have different etiquette due to the different ethical relationships.</p>
<p>"義" (yì, righteousness) is the common interest of the public. We advocate the word "義" (yì, righteousness) to make everyone strive for the public interest. So-called "急公好義" (jígōng hàoyì, eager for public good and fond of righteousness) means serving the society and the people, advocating justice and fairness, and carrying out public undertakings to create public welfare, all of which are included in the meaning of the word "義" (yì, righteousness). Even willing to sacrifice oneself to save or win the interests of the majority of people, the so-called "捨身取義" (shěshēn qǔyì, sacrificing one's life to take righteousness) is the same principle. This starts from the concept of common interests and a sense of responsibility, that is, with the "large self" as the goal, which is a kind of virtue with the most active expression among the "Four Cardinal Virtues."</p>
<p>"廉" (lián, integrity) means being honest and law-abiding, without corruption, which is the conceptual function of preventing individuals from infringing on public interests. If a person's desires are not restrained, it is easy to infringe on the interests of others and even public interests. Especially those who hold public office may use the convenience of their powers to erode public interests, which also destroys the law. We advocate the word "廉" (lián, integrity) to make everyone aware of their conduct, respect their personality, and dare not have the heart of greed and lawlessness, which is the self-restraint effect of the ethical concept of preventing problems before they occur.</p>
<p>"恥" (chǐ, shame) is the conceptual term for correcting the destruction of ethical principles. On an individual level, if one has an evil thought, has the intention of destroying ethical principles and harming others, or has already committed immoral acts, then the word "恥" (chǐ, shame) can be used to eliminate evil thoughts or stop destructive behaviors to save the restoration of ethical principles. Therefore, "知恥" (zhīchǐ, knowing shame) is an essential condition for an individual to survive in a social group. From the perspective of the "large self," public interests are also personal interests, and maintaining ethical principles and the welfare of the social group is also a personal responsibility. If ethical principles and public rights are destroyed by others, the individual also considers it a great shame and humiliation and must rise up to defeat the destroyers or invaders to restore social principles and public rights before they can avenge the shame and fulfill their responsibilities. The development of the meaning of "恥" (chǐ, shame) has a great function, with an active saving force. Therefore, its meaning is linked to the word "勇" (yǒng, courage). The sayings "過則勿憚改" (guò zé wù dàn gǎi, if you have made a mistake, do not be afraid to correct it), "知恥近乎勇" (zhīchǐ jìnhū yǒng, knowing shame is close to courage), and "明恥敎戰" (míngchǐ jiàozhàn, understanding shame and teaching war) are all force effects on the concept of "恥" (chǐ, shame).</p>
<p>The characteristics of the meanings of the four words "禮" (lǐ, ritual), "義" (yì, righteousness), "廉" (lián, integrity), and "恥" (chǐ, shame) are that people automatically and spontaneously maintain social order and protect public rights and interests. No matter what degree the social system changes to in the future, this central meaning will remain unchanged forever and can be permanently adapted. The function of these four words starts from ethical concepts and reaches the goal of social construction. (The End)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>Serenade</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Cut a piece of the hazy night to fill the two window frames in my room, as light gray curtains like glass. Let the starlight leak in from these curtains, let the leisurely wind before dawn blow in from these curtains, and give me a bath in the coolness.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>A white bird, panting, carrying a back full of slanting sunlight, flew hurriedly to the seaside. Arriving at the gradually gray beach, the white bird shook its body, suddenly throwing away its back of slanting sunlight, breathed a sigh of relief, looked back at the red sun hanging on the mountainside, felt it was not surprising at all, and then slowly strolled on the beach.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>A hexagonal bamboo hat, a short shirt of white cloth, short pants of blue cloth, bare feet in straw sandals, carrying a bamboo pole, with a birdcage tied to the end of the pole, the cage covered with willow branches and leaves, inside the cage were cicadas chirping "zhī le, zhī le." Two young farmers selling cicadas, walking leisurely back and forth on the busy Fuzhou Road, truly giving the city a dose of refreshment.</p>
<h3>Charming Lee</h3>
<p>— Qin Ling</p>
<p>Beauty and intelligence are sometimes an unparalleled gift for a woman, but using them as capital is the most dangerous speculation.</p>
<p>It is said that entering C University without knowing Charming Lee is an irreparable regret.</p>
<p>I don't remember clearly the first time I saw her, but her attire—a green suit, green sunglasses, a wide-brimmed soft straw hat tilted on her head, and a string of white pearl necklaces around her neck—was so pretty and clever that you couldn't help but think, "She should indeed be called Charming Lee."</p>
<p>Her Chinese name is "Li Jiaming," but because it doesn't sound as crisp and pleasant as Charming Lee, the former has been forgotten. Her father is a staff member of the ambassador to the United States, and Jiaming lived with her father in the United States for three years, speaking fluent English. She socializes with diplomats all day long and is the headmaster's goddaughter. Naturally, her status at C University is unique.</p>
<p>She is a third-year medical student, one class above us. Our classrooms are next to each other. Every morning, about twenty minutes into the first class, there are often hurried sounds of high heels in the corridor. Male students whisper, "Charming Lee! Charming Lee!" Sure enough, nine times out of ten, it's her. The silk ribbon at her hairline flashes past the glass window. Although we are not in the same grade, we often see each other in the dining hall. In fact, "often" here only includes lunchtime. Jiaming never appears in the dining hall for breakfast or dinner. Even so, we became acquaintances who didn't know each other well. She always runs into the dining hall with a smiling face, bouncing along. When the old woman respectfully calls out "Miss Li" while wringing her hands, she is already scooping soup with a spoon. Everyone's comment on her is, "Although she is like a Western palace empress, she is not arrogant." This is probably one of the reasons why most people like her.</p>
<p>Our dormitory is located in the center of the garden, with bamboo forests and bushes in the corners of the walls, and yellow roses decorate the lawn in front. Outside the surrounding wall is the farm. When the wind blows, the bamboo forest rustles and the ancient well under the trees seems even more silent. From the farm, the gentle cooing of pigeons is heard from time to time. The environment is extremely quiet. On mornings without classes, we always like to pull a deck chair onto the corridor and prepare for lessons facing the garden. Once, when I was repeatedly reciting Latin and feeling a little sleepy, there was a faint sound of footsteps behind me. Turning my head, it was Jiaming again. She walked up the stone steps and greeted me with a familiar air:</p>
<p>"Are you reading Latin?" she smiled radiantly.</p>
<p>"Yes, won't you sit for a while?" I pulled over a chair next to me and carefully looked at her. Black shawl, black silk cheongsam, trimmed with sparkling small lenses around the edges, and the same color leather shoes, a complete evening party outfit. Dropping her handbag, she sat down.</p>
<p>"Another monthly exam, I haven't even looked at tomorrow's pathology..." she mumbled, her eyes showing a tired look.</p>
<p>"Another all-nighter last night!" Her black, slender eyebrows told me of a night of wild dancing.</p>
<p>"That's right... I envy you for having the peace of mind to study," she said, hitting her legs with her hands, her eyebrows furrowed like wrinkled flower petals.</p>
<p>"Why can't you do that!" I said in a slightly sarcastic tone.</p>
<p>"Do you think I like this kind of life!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"For a ship that has lost its rudder, you can't control its direction..."</p>
<p>We ended the conversation in silence. Yes, with my personality, I'm afraid I will never understand Jiaming. When you run into the dormitory with a series of waves, I smile slightly to myself. It is a miracle if a person has reached such an age and still cannot live in the habits of their own choice. It was not just hearsay that Jiaming's notes and exam papers were all done by male classmates. She herself does not read books at all. Someone advised her that since she doesn't have time to read books, why not study a more relaxed department like commerce or literature. She replied: "Studying medicine sounds more glamorous!" Would someone who studies medicine for glamour be forced to socialize and dance all night? She dropped the rudder herself, she doesn't need a rudder!</p>
<p>The anniversary celebration is the most enjoyable festival at C University, because it is near the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the atmosphere in the evening is particularly deep. When Beijing opera was being performed in the auditorium with gongs and drums, I couldn't stand the noise and quietly walked out with Qinlv, who was sitting next to me. When we ran into the wooden fence of the women's dormitory, we both slowed down. Here, a white stone avenue winds around the prayer room and leads directly to the front porch of the dormitory. Both sides are full of lush green privets, their thick leaves shining in the moonlight; one snow pine after another, graceful canopies, emitting a deep emerald green; the night wind carries a bit of coolness. Just as we were silently walking along the avenue, three or four figures came towards us, talking and laughing. I only saw the one in front clearly, it was Xiao Bai from Medical Three—also a very active fellow, wearing a sash.</p>
<p>"Are you going to Xuanwu Lake?" An enviable tone of happiness.</p>
<p>Qinlv shook her head and stopped, holding me. Sighing at their backs, she said:</p>
<p>"These girls, really!" After passing the prayer room, I pulled Qinlv up the stone steps and sat on the stone railing in front of the door; facing the cold moonlight, someone staggered out, covering her face with a handkerchief. Qinlv, with quick eyes, said softly to me: "Charming Lee!"</p>
<p>We wondered why she didn't go to Xuanwu Lake. Running into the prayer room, we saw that the white candles in front of the altar were still dripping with wax tears. Could it be that Jiaming sings and dances all night, but is the only one who is haggard at this moment? That touch of bleakness that she had not taken away seemed to have infected us as well. We looked at each other in silence and sighed knowingly. Then, the recent rumors about Jiaming are not entirely unfounded. "For a ship that has lost its rudder, you can't control its direction." Yes, emotion is the most beautiful and also the most cruel decoration of life. Those who know how to use emotion will gain supreme happiness in the world, otherwise they will fall into the abyss of sin.</p>
<p>In the second year after I left C University, I heard that Jiaming got married. The other party was the son of an embassy secretary, possessing a great deal of property, but was a cripple. However, compared to Jiaming's first misstep, it was still a stable destination. After the marriage, they lived in a villa in West Lake. Jiaming was good at wearing beautiful clothes, so facing the faint moon and beautiful water of West Lake, she could find compensation for her unfulfilled emotional defects. Then I heard that she had a child, probably with a name similar to Peter or John. I hope her maternal love can erase the traces of pain. But recently, I heard people say that Jiaming died of TB. She decorated the lives of others, but let others decorate her tomb. Flowers that grow on the tips of green leaves bloom the earliest and wither the fastest, that is certain. However, the ups and downs of Jiaming's life have been surprisingly fast, regrettable fast.</p>
<h3>Return</h3>
<p>— Renoir</p>
<p>This painting, "Return," is an early work by Auguste Renoir. The style is similar to Manet's. The brushstrokes are delicate, the outlines are clear, and the colors are simpler than his later works. The original work first flowed into England, and then the French government paid a high price to recover it. It is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Stars of a Summer Night</h3>
<p>— Pei Yin</p>
<p>Summer Night</p>
<p>The sky twinkles with stars</p>
<p>A thousand grains of fire light up on the earth</p>
<p>Light and dark in the boundless wilderness of night</p>
<p>Is a pair of mysterious images ah!</p>
<p>The moist grass is a soft bed</p>
<p>I lie down, stretching out my limbs freely</p>
<p>Let the breeze kiss my thin clothes</p>
<p>Listen to the floating frog drums in the distance</p>
<p>Look at the stars in the sky</p>
<p>Embedded in the deep blue sky...</p>
<p>A falling star</p>
<p>Drags a long yellow tail</p>
<p>Across half the sky</p>
<p>I remember that ancient legend:——</p>
<p>When a star falls</p>
<p>A soul enters heaven——</p>
<p>So I care about the family of the deceased</p>
<p>And yearn for that departed star——</p>
<p>Where does it fall after all,</p>
<p>The night wind wanders in the wilderness</p>
<p>Broadcasting the fresh breath of rice leaves</p>
<p>I realize a quiet, indescribable loneliness</p>
<p>The tide of deep longing surges in my heart</p>
<p>Many times, I choose the brightest star</p>
<p>Representing a noble and kind soul</p>
<p>This eliminates my countless times of loneliness</p>
<p>On a quiet, starry night</p>
<p>A hardworking night traveler</p>
<p>Treading on the faint starlight</p>
<p>Comes from the distant faraway</p>
<p>The stars have a kind heart</p>
<p>He lights up the hopes of travelers...</p>
<p>Dragging a heavy memory</p>
<p>Treading on the cobblestone path</p>
<p>Towards my small house</p>
<p>I wade in the silent July night...</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 360</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"About the past, I want to talk about it again later. Right now, I want to exchange some information with you first, what do you think?..." I know Yaoqun is anxious to know the current situation of Tsurumi, and also eager to know the situation of Mr. W in Beiping. She cannot use communication equipment, so she cannot obtain information on these two aspects, and of course feels depressed. But I think "information first."</p>
<p>"Alright..." Yaoqun's eyes flickered.</p>
<p>"Yesterday we detected that the Sakagaki, Sakai, and Suzuki teams have combined, and they will attack Nankou today. Is this information reliable?" I first raised this point.</p>
<p>"Yes, it should have been launched last night," Yaoqun nodded, "but so far, we haven't heard anything. Could it be that they really let them pass so quietly?"</p>
<p>"That's impossible," I told Yaoqun; "Tang Bu's 13th Army arrived a week ago to set up defenses. They must not let them pass so easily."</p>
<p>"That's what I said," Yaoqun seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, "that's great, I can take charge of one side exclusively; as long as we get those big shots out of the circle, we'll be able to make it in time!"</p>
<p>"Make it to where?... What for?" I felt that Yaoqun's tone was not specifically referring to the establishment of a branch in Shanxi; it seemed there was another, more important task.</p>
<p>Hearing my question, Yaoqun immediately flashed those already yellowish eyeballs, and stared at me for a moment, expressing some bewilderment: "Can't be...! You don't even know that the Songbe Unit has already had dealings with our General Liu, Liu Ruming" The word "dealings" was used humorously.</p>
<p>"Oh!" This information really surprised me: "This General Liu is a confidant in Shanxi, a formal member, one of Shanxi's 'assets'... If he is hooked by Japanese spies, it is simply equivalent to dismantling the stage of Shanxi, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" Yaoqun sneered. He is stationed on the outer edge of Shanxi's heart and lungs, - from the throat to the stomach-...</p>
<p>"This news...?" I wanted to ask Yaoqun "the source of this news and its authenticity;" because I was a little afraid to believe it. If this is an unmistakable piece of news, the northwest half, at least the circle of Shanxi and Hebei, will be dangerous. In other words, Nankou has no value to defend; even if you risk your life to resist for a while, it is only a waste of some troops.</p>
<p>"100% sure!" Yaoqun had already understood my intentions, and answered me so decisively: "I have seen the stub of the Songbe Unit's leader's order, the intelligence from the Zhangbei branch, and the amount of activity funds... I..." Yaoqun said to this point, suddenly said "huh" with surprise, as if remembering something. She asked me: "How long have you been in Changping?... When did you leave Beiping?"</p>
<p>I told her that I had only left Beiping yesterday, and arrived in Changping yesterday as well.</p>
<p>"That's strange!" Yaoqun had a somewhat astonished look; "Didn't the team leader reveal it to you... about this news?"</p>
<p>I know why Yaoqun was astonished, probably because she didn't know that her intelligence was traveling so slowly: "Headquarters only received your intelligence three times in total. This third piece of intelligence was only received half an hour after I set off." This is a relevant fact, I cannot hide it from her forever.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Achieve a Noon Dream</h3>
<p>— Meng Nong</p>
<p>A quarter or half an hour after lunch can be said to belong to me. If you follow the ideas of the ancients, you can burn a pot of incense, boil a pot of tea, and hold a book in your hand, which is naturally a unique and interesting thing.</p>
<p>I don't hope to have (and naturally can't have) such a life. I just want to take a nap, not looking at anything, doing nothing, and even temporarily eliminating the habit of thinking about anything. This is enough to make me enter a world of comfort, tranquility, leisure, and wandering.</p>
<p>With the bamboo blinds half-rolled up, lying down comfortably on a couch, without wearing long trousers or socks, just stretching my limbs, closing my eyelids, first pretending to take a nap, and soon falling asleep. This kind of happy nap is a common thing for idlers, but in my opinion, it is the leisure of busy people, a fate that can be encountered but not sought, and the supreme happiness in the world.</p>
<p>Near the north window, there was originally a neighboring family's barren garden, no, it was simply a garbage dump that hides dirt and filth. Rotten iron cans, withered grass, and sludge were piled up like small mountains, and when the sun shone on them, they evaporated an unspeakable stench. Mosquitoes, flies, and horseflies were all rolling and dancing there, which was naturally a good place like their paradise.</p>
<p>If I don't open the north window, I feel too stuffy; but if I open it, I feel inexplicably uncomfortable. Sometimes, helplessly, I have to plan this way, open it for a while, and then close it for a while, to let me breathe. However, this leads to another problem, my drowsy eyes have already woken up, and my noon dream is naturally out of the question, and it is too late to chase after it.</p>
<p>Lying down, lying down, barely lying down. Annoying flies are attacking me all over, with a buzzing noise, flying to my head for a while, and then flying back, as if deliberately playing a joke on me.</p>
<p>So at this time I had to get up from a lying position and start a fly-swatting exercise. The flies can't be caught, so I have a big showdown with the air.</p>
<p>After launching the fly-swatting exercise, it seems that the dead are dead and the escaped have escaped, so I can rest assured that I can take a nap, but that's not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>The most hateful is a kind of old fly. Old flies are used to fly-swatting exercises, so when I conduct fly-swatting exercises, they are not panicked, and they know what kind of way to temporarily avoid others' edge. When the exercise returns to quiet, it suddenly flies out from the dark corner and sits on the ceiling or power line, sitting there silently and motionless, as if peeping at the movements, laughing secretly at people, or at least planning to launch another offensive.</p>
<p>It's difficult to achieve a noon dream, so I have to let it go. In order to pass the difficult afternoon of the long summer, I simply opened a novel. It was really accidental and coincidental. I read a novel by the Swedish writer Raqilov, and found that there were also "Zaiyu painting bedroom" characters in Sweden, who not only liked to take a nap themselves, but also insisted on developing the habit of napping in his children. The novel says that a general named Lai Jiulov believes that if children are to grow up to be healthy, strong, capable, and useful, the first important thing is to develop the habit of napping. Therefore, every time after lunch, he always led two little girls to the villa. But those girls didn't think so. They pounced on General Lai, entangled him, pulled his beard, pulled his hair, and joked with him. After joking enough, they climbed into the small bed, pretending to sleep, which is equivalent to pretending to be dead, because General Lai does not allow the children to climb out of the small bed, or make a conversation. General Lai is asleep, but his snoring makes his two daughters, who need to develop the habit of napping, unable to sleep. They feel the horror of napping, the horror of a long time in the summer afternoon! Their only hope is in the flies. I hope that the flies will fly to General Lai's face with a buzzing sound, louder and longer, and wake him up quickly!</p>
<p>They suffer on the bed during nap time, cursing, which General Lai does not understand. They are envious of the fun of those who don't take a nap outside the window, running around, happy and carefree, eating peaches and bayberries, but General Lai, who is greedy for noon dreams, doesn't understand these?</p>
<h3>Parrot Beak</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Bai Letian's Yangming Cave Poem: "Hometown flavor cherishes Peng Hu, seasonal freshness values ​​partridge." Peng Hu is similar to crab, but smaller than crab, living in sandy caves by the water. Its color is bright red, commonly known as parrot beak. Also known as crab. "Shi Shuo Xin Yu" records: "Cai Mo crossed the river, mistakenly ate crab, vomited and slumped," Wu Song produced this thing, but only ate its claws. Every summer, it is made into soup with crab meat, the taste is extremely delicious, and I have never heard of anyone having diarrhea from eating it. Yuan Tao Zongyi's "Stopped Farming Record" food item also has: "Shanghai in Songjiang, Haining in Hangzhou, people all like to eat crab claws, named parrot beak, because there are very red ones that look like it."</p>
<h3>Night on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Yao Yu</p>
<p>The wings of night sneakily extend towards the lake surface. The sky gradually darkens, and the mountains led by South Peak and North Peak fall asleep in a daze, drawing a winding black shadow on the milky white edge of the sky. Everything is blurred, and even with good eyesight, you can only see a vague outline. Because the night brings tranquility and comfort to West Lake, West Lake seems more spacious and beautiful than during the day.</p>
<p>The streetlights on Bai Causeway and Su Causeway blink with kind eyes. Her radiance gracefully passes through the willow groves and flowers on the lakefront, forming a black and white pattern with lace on the asphalt road. When I walked across Jin Dai Bridge in a thin shirt on a moonlit night, I once thought: Wouldn't it be more poetic to turn off the streetlights and let the bright moonlight pour down on the levee on this summer night? The night of West Lake seems to belong to human lovers. He (she) sits quietly under the willow shade, remembering a string of sweet memories, telling endless soft words. When sweetness intoxicates two hearts, does she (he) want to have a passionate embrace and a light kiss? Would she (he) resent it for being too bright for this dim street light? However, a gloomy night, a strange traveler, how will they tell the longing and gratitude in their hearts to this holy flower blooming in the darkness? ... Therefore, I deeply realize that only the light in the darkness is truly worthy of cherishing; and darkness and light are eternally fighting! ...</p>
<p>The lakefront is full of people. When a breeze suddenly blows from the lake at night, everyone will give a knowing smile at the same time. This refreshing pleasure is indeed not something that eating popsicles and ice cream can appreciate! As long as you line up a sleeping chair in front of the park or store, it becomes an ideal bed; you can snore to sleep with your chest bare. The corners of the walls are piled with urban dregs - ragged beggars, they are having different summer night dreams, dreaming of picking up gold, and also dreaming of the arrival of autumn, the arrival of winter... Although they do not have mosquito nets and DDT to resist mosquitoes and fleas, they at least have company...</p>
<p>At this moment, it should be the time when blue fluorescence paints across the vast night, the breeze sways the dense rice leaves, and the spinning girl and toad accompany the melodious nocturne between the fields. However, living in the city for a long time, where should I go to find it? I really want a night with a clear moon and a gentle breeze, let me throw myself into the wilderness, let me relive the mood of a summer night in the countryside! ...</p>

<h3>The Psychology of Merchants</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Some time ago, prices galloped forward, like a wild horse without a rein, unable to stop it. The marked prices of all goods jumped unbelievably; merchants, however, complained to their customers that business was difficult and selling an item was like losing money, because the wholesale price had already jumped past their retail price. Therefore, they always said that it was better not to sell than to "not be able to replenish the stock."</p>
<p>However, recently, all prices have been falling. Gold notes on the black market, superior white rice, and smart head items have all fallen by one-third, which is a rare thing to see in months.</p>
<p>But what surprises us is that the marked prices of many items have not been reduced. For example, the prices of Western medicines when the US dollar black market was high before are still stubbornly immovable; and many American goods, although their wholesale prices have been reduced, their retail prices are still "high above."</p>
<p>This kind of merchant's calculation and merchant's psychology often make it difficult for people to be convinced. We sympathize with merchants for having their "troubles" now, but their attitude of only having "themselves" and not "customers" cannot win the sympathy of the general public.</p>
<p>We feel that at this time, merchants should automatically reduce prices, so that customers can change their psychology and views on merchants.</p>
<p>The price of rice has fallen to more than 300,000, and the black market price of gold notes has fallen by half. Why don't our merchants try to suppress prices a little?</p>

<h3>The Troubles of Korea</h3>
<p>— Pu Lun</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Recent negotiations between the US and the Soviet Union regarding Korea do not seem to be progressing smoothly. Wise people all over the world are concerned about the future development of US-Soviet relations. The editor has specially invited Mr. Pu Lun to introduce the geographical situation of Korea, which will be of some benefit to readers.</p>
<p>Having just escaped the suffering of Japanese enslavement, Korea has not obtained the freedom and equality it desired, but has become a testing ground for the two major ideologies of democracy and communism. Indeed, the 38th parallel north is like a bloody blade, cutting Korea into two sections; the Stars and Stripes fly in the south, and the hammer and sickle flag flies in the north. The most interesting thing is that both regions are regarded as the "cradle of democracy."</p>
<p>This ancient country with a long history of five thousand years, its economic and political backwardness, and the importance of its strategic geography, have painted Korean history in a very dim color. These three factors, "three in one," have become a chain that tightly binds it, preventing it from finding a suitable and satisfactory home in this long process.</p>
<p>Korea is a large peninsula in Asia, protruding between the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, facing Japan to the east across the Sea of Japan; bordering the Korean Strait to the south; facing Hebei and Shandong provinces of our country to the west across the Yellow Sea; and bordering Liaoning, Jilin, and Siberian parts of the Soviet Union to the north, with the Changbai Mountains, the Yalu River, and parts of the Tumen River as the boundary. Precisely because it is close to Manchuria and the Soviet Union in the north, and close to Japan in the east, it has formed its important strategic position. Therefore, Japanese imperialists used it as a springboard to enter the Asian continent and as a base to seize Manchuria and attack the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This geographical factor is indeed a great temptation, but it is not the dominant reason. Economic and political backwardness are the dominant reasons. Before Korea became a Japanese colony, it was still in a state of agricultural society economically, and politically it was still under an autocratic feudal system. Korea's land system has always been state-owned in principle. By the Goguryeo era, the land system became even more practically state-owned. The king was not only the supreme sovereign of politics and military affairs, but also the supreme owner of state land. The people only had the right to cultivate the land but not the right to own it. Politically, Korea has always been ruled by autocratic feudal forces. Therefore, it buried the independence and freedom of the Korean nation!</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of Korea began at the end of the 16th century. The 350,000 troops of the Japanese feudal lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, after seven years of attack, did not defeat Korea, but retreated automatically. However, the Japanese took away many scholars and craftsmen, and also took away 30,000 salted Korean ears and noses. After that, Japan's ambition for Korea did not relax at all, and it formally annexed Korea in 1910.</p>
<p>However, the high degree of exploitation by Japanese imperialists nurtured the seeds of the Korean national liberation movement. The development of the Korean national liberation movement can be roughly divided into three main stages: from 1910 to the "March 1st" Revolution in 1919, it was the first stage; from the "March 1st" Revolution to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it was the second stage; and during World War II, it was the third stage. After Japan surrendered, it entered a new stage.</p>
<p>The current division of Korea is to divide almost the entire Gangwon Province of Korea into two competing parts, and part of Hwanghae Province is the US military occupation zone, and a small part of Gyeonggi Province is the Soviet military occupation zone. The US military occupation zone has more than 36,761 square miles, accounting for 43.1% of the total area of Korea, and the Soviet military occupation zone has 48,487 square miles, accounting for 56.90% of the total area. In terms of population, the population of the US military zone accounts for two-thirds of the total population of Korea, but it has recently changed. It is very likely that the population of the Soviet military occupation zone is 40%, and the US military occupation zone is 60%.</p>
<h3>Reluctant Departure</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Flying Discs Visit Shanghai's Sky</p>
<p>Flying discs on the sea turn pale; who's throwing empty discs to intimidate? Is it seeking a transaction? Market discs fly high and fast?</p>
<p>Who sees the foreigner's disc as truly lacking morals? A flurry over the expensive "murderous disc"—How many golden houses? The mind calculates, the worry complete!</p>
<p>Note: "Empty disc," "disc," and "murderous disc" are all Shanghai market terms. "Murderous disc" refers to an expensive disc. "Foreign disc" is a term for outsiders, originating from foreign goods whose intricacies are only known to those who understand foreign languages. Here, Lu uses these terms with different interpretations.</p>
<h3>Lin Zexu</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>What distinguished Lin Wenzhong from other famous ministers of the Qing Dynasty was the Opium War. At that time, Gong was the Governor-General of Liangguang, strongly advocated banning opium, and confiscated more than eight-tenths of the opium from British merchant ships, receiving praise from the Emperor. The Daoguang Emperor even personally wrote to report: "Now that you have taken such action, it would be greatly unacceptable to show weakness again. I do not worry about your recklessness, but I sincerely hope that you will not be timid. To control, first use force and then virtue is the best method." It can be seen that at the beginning of the war, the Qing Emperor was still arrogant and self-important. After the defeat, Gong was exiled to Yili.</p>
<p>Historical records state that Zexu's courtesy name was Yuanfu, also known as Shaomu, a native of Minhou, Fujian. He was less than six feet tall, but his eyes shone brightly, and his voice was like a bell. Every time he engaged in intense discussions, even those several houses away could hear him clearly. At the age of twenty-seven, he became a Jinshi. In the third year of Daoguang, he was promoted to Surveillance Commissioner of Jiangsu, where he resolved cases fairly and justly, and the people called him Lin Qingtian (Lin the Just). He was particularly skilled in water conservancy. When he was the Governor-General of Huguang, the Jingxiang region suffered from minor floods. Gong repaired the dikes and supervised the work, and the floods were completely eliminated. When it was discussed that he should be exiled, he passed through Kaifeng and the river breached. He was retained to supervise the repairs. After the work was completed, he still went into exile. It seems that the order of exile was not originally the intention of the Qing court, but it was a concession made to the British threats. After Gong arrived outside the pass, he was ordered to investigate and manage land reclamation matters. He personally visited Kuche, Aksu, Yarkand, and Ilik and other cities, covering a distance of 30,000 li horizontally and vertically, and water conservancy was greatly developed. When he had some spare time, he amused himself with writing and painting. Gong's calligraphy was based on Ouyang Xun's style, and his poetry followed Bai Juyi's. Although Yili was a large metropolis in the frontier province, within a few months, silk and paper were all used up. After four years in Yili, he returned and gradually resumed his official duties, later becoming the Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou. In the thirtieth year of Daoguang, the Hong and Yang armies rose up. He was ordered to lead the army as an imperial envoy, but he died on the way before arriving. Commentators say that Gong was superior to Zeng Wenzheng because Wenzheng did not understand the distinction of race, while Gong did not engage in combat with Hong and Yang. Is that true?</p>
<h3>The Protagonist of the Xigong Banner Tragedy: Queen Qi Junfeng</h3>
<p>— Xiu Tang</p>
<p>According to a report on the 25th, the Queen of the Xigong Banner of Ulanqab League, Qi Junfeng, and the young Wang of the Mo Clan, Qi Fawu, were assassinated by Hao Youlong, the head of the security regiment of the banner, and his troops in the Gongsha area. The news of the murder shocked the border. The truth of the tragedy is still under investigation by the relevant authorities. Queen Qi Junfeng and the wife of the E Wang of the Donggong Banner, Ba Yunying, are both well-known anti-Japanese queens in Mongolia. During the war, they led the Mongol compatriots to support the central government's resistance against Japan and made great contributions.</p>
<p>Queen Qi Junfeng was the daughter of Shilabdorji (King Shi), the Jasagh of the Xigong Banner of Ulanqab League. Her father was a prince of the Alxa Banner of Ningxia at the end of the Qing Dynasty with revolutionary ideas, so he was removed from his position and exiled. She lived in Beiping with her mother. During this time, she studied Mongolian and Chinese languages. She was intelligent and excelled in eloquence and social skills. In 1932, at the young age of eighteen, she married King Shi.</p>
<p>In 1935, the East Assistant E Baozhai of Xigong Banner colluded with Ishidagden, the uncle of King Shi and a senior Lama, under the instigation of Prince De, and a rebellion occurred. After two years, it was fortunately quelled by the stationed troops. This was a difficult time she experienced with King Shi shortly after her marriage, and it was also a scene that honed her abilities. In 1936, King Shi passed away, and she was only twenty-two years old at this time, becoming a young widow. Fortunately, she was already pregnant. The people around King Shi wanted to take the opportunity to push the former Guanqi, Zhongkesa Geduer Zhabu, to inherit King Shi's position as Jasagh, but she strongly opposed it because she was pregnant and did not know if it would be a boy or girl. As a result, a compromise was reached with Sa Ren, the East Assistant, concurrently holding the seal of Jasagh. This handling of the matter fully demonstrated her courage and political ability. Sure enough, in 1937, she gave birth to a son named Altanochir, so the succession was no longer a problem. This Altanochir is the young Wang Qi Fawu who was also murdered this time.</p>
<p>On July 7, 1937, the Xigong Banner was invaded by enemy cavalry. The East Assistant Sageduer Zhabu and the West Assistant Seringhorlochochir surrendered to the enemy, colluding with the E Qi of the previous rebellion, seizing the seal, and using all means of coercion and enticement. However, the Queen did not move slightly. In an environment of life-threatening hardship and difficulty, the brave Queen Qi Junfeng had to resolutely take her old mother and son to flee. On the night of February 24, 1938, she escaped from the tiger's mouth, reorganized the troops, and carried out the anti-Japanese war mission of the Mongolian banner. The central government deeply appreciated her steadfastness and loyalty and formally appointed her as the Jasagh and garrison commander of the Xigong Banner. Not long after, she also served as a member of the Sui Border Mongolian Government Affairs Committee and a special commissioner of the Kuanyuan Mongolian Banner Party Affairs. She is the first woman in Mongolian history to serve as the head of a banner, the garrison commander with military responsibilities, and the party and government work. (25th)</p>
<h3>The Demise of an Honest Official</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>The Shanghai news section of the Ta Kung Pao published a news item about Zhang Xiuwen, the former director of the Salt Affairs Bureau, publicly seeking employment. I finished reading it with infinite sympathy and felt very disappointed.</p>
<p>The news began by saying: "Life is pressing. The former director of the National Salt Administration... submitted a letter to the reader's page of this newspaper seeking employment..." It is true that life is pressing, but it is strange that even a salt bureau official, who has been recognized as a lucrative position since ancient times, feels the pressure of life after leaving office.</p>
<p>The problem is not that life has been able to push someone as noble as the director of the salt bureau to the point of not being able to survive, but that an official like Zhang, who has served in the salt bureau for as long as 35 years, not only failed to spend his years leisurely after leaving office but even had to lose face, complain to the public, and seek help after being "pressed by life."</p>
<p>This is truly the demise of an "honest official," and it also shows that it is very undesirable to be an honest official. "Clean sleeves" have now become a historical term. I never thought that I would actually see such a person in this life who is digging his own grave with this outdated and pedantic thinking, causing his wife and children to suffer along with him.</p>
<p>We don't need to talk about the salt officials since the Republic of China. First, let's talk about how, after the Han Dynasty inherited the evils of the Qin Dynasty, powerful families monopolized the profits of salt and iron. It was said that: "The income from salt profits does not benefit the country above, nor the people below, but only fills the private pockets of the salt officials. The state's salt tax revenue is not even enough to pay the salaries of the service personnel." This is what the Book of Han says: "The taxes of the world are not even enough to pay for their transportation expenses." The wealth of salt officials was such that they not only "communicated with princes and nobles and their power exceeded that of officials," but they also exhausted all the luxuries of the world. The feasts and revelry of salt officials in the late Qing Dynasty are described in detail in folklore novels.</p>
<p>Therefore, we feel that Mr. Zhang was unable to "commit adultery with the counties, increase empty accounts, the government treasury was not substantial, and the people were in distress..." during his tenure in the salt administration, which had been plagued by such problems for nearly two thousand years. This is precisely the cause of his being pressed by life today.</p>
<p>For an ordinary salt official, whether it is the Han, Jin, Yuan, Ming dynasties, or even the late Qing Dynasty or the Republic of China, if they are a little "flexible," they can currently live in Shanghai as a retired gentleman with three to five "Studebakers" and three to five garden villas. How much more should it be true for Mr. Zhang, who has served in the salt administration for thirty-five years and held the esteemed position of Director-General of the General Bureau, who has reached the point of publicly seeking employment, and the conditions for seeking employment are set so "pitifully"!</p>
<p>According to the reporter's report after visiting, it is believed that</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang: "Participated in the revolution in his early years, later served in the Ministry of Finance, and then transferred to the Salt Affairs Bureau, where he worked for more than 30 years. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Director of the Sichuan-Kang Salt Administration Bureau... After the reorganization of the General Salt Affairs Bureau into the Salt Administration Bureau, he served as the first Director..." Just looking at this resume, if it were not for the faithful report of the Ta Kung Pao, we might express doubts.</p>
<p>Starting from Mr. Zhang's job search, I can't help but think of my many friends whose positions are far inferior to those of Mr. Zhang, who transport wine and meat in large trucks when entertaining guests, and the scene of dozens of tables at a time.</p>
<p>I am someone who has eaten the wine and food of salt officials, and I have never thought that there would be salt officials in the world as poor as me. Mr. Zhang's matter proves on the one hand that honest officials have reached the end of the road and no one should do it again, and on the other hand, it can also explain that many people were not rich officials when they were in office, but after leaving office, they can actually live as extravagant retired gentlemen in Shanghai. The unspeakable points can be understood with a thought.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Many Sinologists in the United States praise the thorough service in Shanghai barbershops, where a single haircut takes at least an hour. While this may be uneconomical in terms of time, the thorough scraping, polishing, and meticulous care are worthwhile. Although the barber's rough fingers may cause unpleasant sensations when stroking your face, the entire process – haircutting, shaving, washing, blow-drying, and applying hair oil – costs only 10,000 to 20,000 Legal Tender, equivalent to two or three dimes in the black market, which is extremely cheap. Once you come to the United States, you will encounter great difficulties with haircuts. When you step into the barbershop, many customers are already waiting. You have to sit down in order and may have to wait for two hours. Finally, you hear a "Next" and it's your turn to sit in the swivel chair. The barber picks up an electric clipper and sweeps through your hair like a gust of wind blowing away fallen leaves, shaving it into a spiky mess like a jackfruit. In less than three minutes, your head is shaved or, to put it bluntly, slaughtered, for 75 cents. He asks if you want a shave, which costs another 50 cents. Do you want a shampoo? Great, that's another 50 cents. After washing your hair, you have to add oil and water, and the price depends on the brand, usually between 50 cents and one dollar. The final bill comes to about two or three dollars, which is 70,000 to 80,000 Legal Tender. If you want a black man to shine your shoes, you sit on a high chair like the sedan chair of the City God, and rest your legs on a bar. There is no fixed price for shining shoes; one dime is not too little, and five dimes are not too much. As you leave, the black man brushes your coat and you have to take out a dime to earn a "Thanks." When you get home and look closely, your face, neck, and body are covered with short hairs. To avoid being ripped off and to avoid trouble, it is best for students in the United States to buy a pair of clippers and serve each other. Service is the foundation of diligence and thrift. It can save money and develop a skill. If you return to your country and become unemployed, you can still be employed as a "waiting for orders" scholar with a PhD title. Anyway, most ships do not have barbers or are too busy. I advise the first class of self-funded students to practice haircuts at home first, because your 800 official-rate US dollars will not be enough to pay for your haircuts in the United States for three years.

<h3>Butterfly Loves Flowers</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhong</p>
<p>Recently, a university student, Huo Wanli, broke into the boudoir of Miss Chen, his girlfriend, with an unloaded pistol and forced her to marry him—see the city news section of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Shouldn't proposals involve kneeling? Why force entry into her chambers late at night! Doesn't he realize the arrow of love is potent? Brandishing a gun to show a heroic spirit?</p>
<p>Don't laugh at his foolish behavior back then; he learned from both Hua Chong and Zhang Junrui! From now on, forced proposals will become a bad precedent; Misses will be afraid to socialize!</p>
<h3>Thirty-Three Years of the European War</h3>
<p>— Ding Rongguan</p>
<p>Thirty-three years have passed! The Austrian Archduke and his wife were assassinated in the capital of Bosnia on June 28th. A month later, on the evening of July 28th, Austria officially declared war on Serbia! Were over 1,500 days of fighting and over 30 million deaths and injuries not enough for the largest massacre in history?</p>
<p>However, who remembers these bloody and ugly lessons? In just over a decade, weren't the firebugs of the Far East rekindling the wildfire that was already burning? Mankind once again relived the abominable suffering; over 2,000 days of hand-to-hand combat and over 50 million deaths and injuries. History does not repeat itself, but mistakes are repeated over and over again!</p>
<p>Twenty-nine years ago, the sound of the armistice bell rang throughout London. Lloyd George addressed the members of parliament:</p>
<p>"Thus, at eleven o'clock this morning, the most cruel, most terrible, and unprecedented war that has tormented mankind has ended. I hope I can say that on this fateful morning, all wars have ended."</p>
<p>Reality is a terrible mocker! Not long after, Hitler tried "my old fight" in the dream of the "Third Reich." Mussolini completed his exposure of his corpse on the streets of Milan in the delusion of "Roman reconstruction." And Showa practiced the glorious "kneel down" in the poisonous fog of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"—who was helping them to be so arrogant?</p>
<p>"We are living in the most difficult era today. The years of fighting were a time of crisis, sometimes even alarming, but I think the current period is in many ways even more dangerous than wartime" (Marshall's address at Princeton University on February 22 of this year when receiving an honorary degree). In the 1950s, mankind has already tasted more than two catastrophes. Historical mistakes must not be repeated. Facing this path of co-existence or mutual destruction, let the world cherish the path it should follow!</p>
