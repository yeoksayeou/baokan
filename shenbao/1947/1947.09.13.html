<h3>善後委會即成立　公用事業貼補逐步減少　明年施政方針不予擬訂</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日〕政府爲繼續辦理善後救濟事宜及接辦理善後救濟亭宜及接辦聯總行總行將結束之未了業務，將實施憲政行憲後之國家施政方針，未便由過渡時期之現政府代爲擬訂。爲編製卅巨型年度總正式成立。該會主要業務，爲黃汎區之復興，農業漁業之救濟等，除設黃　區復興局外，並將組織善後事業籌議保管委員會，從事籌劃財源保管及物資之之有效使用。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕國民政府委員會十二日上午十時在國府會議廳舉行第十一次國務會議，由孫副主席主持，到會委員張羣，居正，于右任，鄒魯等十六人。首依議程所列，宣讀報吿事項：（一）劃定一時期，確定縣市及其同等區域之選舉單位案。（二）現任官吏競選職業團體分區選舉之國大代表或立法委員，應受法定限制之釋明案。次由國防部長白崇禧報吿最近軍事情形，旋即討論議案：（一）選任政務官及監察委員之懲戒，應送何機關辦理案，決議選任政務官及監察委員之懲戒，均由國民政府政務官懲戒委員會辦理。（二）善後事業委員會組織條例草案，決議通過，交立法院。（三）立法委員連聲海病逝，遺缺以曾集補補充案，決議通過。（四）任命任秉鈞爲監察院監察委員案，決議通過。（五）其他有關財政預算案多起均通過，至十二時散會。</p>
<h3>工商團體國代名額　決增爲六十八名　分配辦法由立法院擬定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕增加工商澳體國代名額案，業經十二日國務會通過，決增至六十八名，其分配辦法由立院議定。按此一要案，係張繼，邵力子，居正，于右任，吳忠信等五府委聯署提出，主要理由爲數月以來，各地商業團體力爭增加國代及立委名額，雖前經本委會決議增加立委五名，惟該團體等以代表名額工商業團體共三十一名，較上屆减少七十三名之多，而商業團體則僅十三名，有欠公允。謹査本屆國代名額之分配，前國防會曾有「照上屆比例」之決議，商業團體似應予以相當之比額。以職業團體之組織而論、商業團體實爲最悠久，最普遍，似亦不宜過事壓抑，且抗戰時期，商業團體負担特重，目前戡亂建國尤待商業界負其經濟上應負之責，分配名額過少，不足以示政府之公允云云。</p>

<h3>傳斯年批評　魏德邁聲明</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕中國參政員傅斯年，今向記者稱，魏德邁近在中國發表臨別聲明，其中百分之九十完全正確。最大缺點爲魏氏對於中國局勢未作定量分析。國府腐敗雖僅限於少數官吏，但此少數官吏高踞財政，經濟重要職位，目前局勢若輩應負主要責任。中國民政可與美國或其他各國相媲美，軍政則不逮遠甚。預料國府將就特使調査所得，發表聲明，其性質不外乎部份接受而部份否認。美國所能給予中國之最佳援助，厥在行政管理方面，且當與政府內部改組變管齊下。魏氏在中國，除共產黨以外，頗孚衆望。自國民黨觀之，地位甚至凌駕馬帥之上，且爲理想中之美駐華大使。</p>
<h3>我被奪地圖印版　盟總令日本歸還</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十二日電〕盟軍總部今下令日本政府，將其戰時奪自我國之地圖印版五千二百七十塊，全部歸還原主。上述印版係印刷中國本部·東北·朝鮮·日本·西伯利亞·馬來聯邦及其鄰近地區之地圖者。</p>
<h3>美國外救濟計劃　將在華開始實施</h3>

<h3>海南島抵訴</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>南遊雜草之五（下）</p>
<p>椰子國的三小時座談，以及此後三天所接觸到的地方人士的陳述，我得到的結論，海南島被「亂」與「窮」兩個字所毒害着。</p>
<p>政治上議而不決，決而不行（如改制）地方長官有責而無權，剿匪計劃一再不能貫澈，以致出了海口市區公路上發生搶刦的事成爲家常。這都是亂的現象。</p>
<p>海南島的物資不能說不豐餽，樹膠，椰子油，糖，海產，是主要的產品，可以代替南洋及台灣的一部分，過去日本人在這里銳意經營，建立了許多工廠，東方水電廠的計劃，打算供應全島電力，而且連環島鐵路都凖備電氣化的。可是接收以後，偸的偸，拆賣的拆賣，都不成樣子了。我曾經參觀過一個營養塲，（製造醬油及罐頭。）它的景象使我要哭了，凡是一個有國家觀念的中國人看到那情形都要哭的。生產事業都停頓了，好人遠涉海洋出外謀生，另一部分則入山爲匪，靠打刦搶掠，於是壯丁流亡。鄕村裏盡是婦孺老弱，因此，海南島現在祗是在靠僑匯來過日子，海口幾家銀行唯一的業務就是從內地運鈔興來。</p>
<p>消滅火災於未然，無功而不討好，且非常喫力；火災業已發生了，焦頭爛額地在搶救，那是個個喝采，人人捧塲。這種政治風氣造成了許多人不從基礎工作上着手，祗是在想投機取巧地邀功了。</p>
<p>蔡勁軍在海南島，很想有一番作爲，他是文昌人，當願爲桑梓服務，依常理說，他也決不會做對不起故鄕父老的事的，也許正因爲他急求事功，若干處所難免不爲地方所不滿。然而這不滿分析起來也近於求全之毀的。比如，抗戰以前，海南島形同化外，等到政令統一，而抗戰又爆發，隨之也淪陷；現在勝利了，許許多多前所未有的捐稅突然加在他們身上，自不爲他們所能了解，所能忍受，他們大都認爲這是專員到任後的苛擾。接收時期的不法貪汚，海南人迄今還當作新鮮問題在談論着，他們懷念着以前陳濟棠主粤時代所派遣的一位陳司令，他們幾乎意氣地把所右當前痛苦都一古腦歸罪於現常局。這自然不是一種公平的論斷。</p>
<p>孤懸海外，這是交通條件不够所致，這很容易製造隔閡，也　容易製造墮落。直到目前爲止，還沒有上海海口間的直達船，還沒有廣州海口間的定期航輪，而廣州海口間的航空班次，每星期也僅是一次，這種現狀假使延長下去，對於海南島的開發，那是　一個極大的肌碍，萬事莫如交通急，海南島上的人最大的苦悶，似乎在感着被國內遺忘了。</p>
<p>上面曾經提到過土匪，在海南島確，乎名符其實地是土著的匪，這班挺而走險的草寇，根本就沒有什麽思想，主義，組織，其所以打着什麽「民主」的幌子者，無非爲了遮醜，呌得響亮一點而已。以前香港曾傳說過李濟琛有什麽組織的活動，並且有軍火接濟海南島的土匪等等，可是行轅主任張發奎和九區剿匪指揮官蔡勁軍却異口同聲地否認其事。由於民性和語言的關係，一個外省人甚至海南島以外的廣東人，要在這裏入夥爲寇，幾乎是絕對不可能的事。看了剿匪指揮部製的那張匪情調査統計圖，也可以證明。正因爲這情形，海南島的土匪有易剿不易剿的兩面。抗戰期間流亡在大後方的本地人，還有出國十數年在南洋一帶謀生的本地人，他們在勝利後興忽忽地都趕回故鄉來，希望看一看父老家園，可是他們祗好逗留在海口，遙望數十里之外的家園而回不得，又怎能不哀怨呢？</p>
<p>政洽重於軍事，至少在海南島這是剿匪的最高指導原則，現當局目前傾其全力在從事淸査戶口，建立保甲連鎖制，倘使眞做得澈底，對於消滅匪患，一定可以收效的，不過同時，也得從經濟方面着手，使人民生活方面能安定才好。　（完）</p>

<h3>白部長在四中全會　軍事報告全文（續前日）</h3>
<p>（三）傷亡官兵撫恤及殘廢軍人之安置：一，官兵撫恤，本部一年來對撫恤措施之發送，茲述其大要如左：（一）改訂制度，放寬證件尺度，並求無缺無濫，改訂遺族領恤辦法，安撫失踪被俘官長之眷屬，對恤金給與，比照陸軍給與及除役時待遇金額，適時調整。（二）簡化手續，推行郵政發餉，簡化領恤手續，普設撫恤詢問處，並將以請恤表格十二種，簡化爲「傷」「亡」請恤表各一種，製發各地郵局機關部隊，地方政府，供請恤者使用。（三）充實人力，增設戰地撫恤機關，就地核恤發恤。（四）委託驗傷，由各地軍醫院或公立醫院代驗，以省請恤者之煩難。（五）設置撫恤基金保管委員會，將撫恤經費劃作國家特別基金，不列入軍費，以保恤戶之法益。（六）頒發榮哀狀，辦理褒揚，表揚，人祀忠烈詞，建立紀念碑，舉辦公葬。（七）傷殘遺族就業優待，職業介紹，收容教養，及子女免費就學等。（八）守土殉職之文職公務員之獎恤，先由本部調查作戰情形，作初步核定，再轉呈行政院。二，殘廢軍人之安置，我國對日抗戰中，因傷致殘之將士達七萬餘人，此項殘廢軍人之善後，除將管理機構併緊縮外，並由主管部門妥擬安置計劃，其要點大致分下列數項：（一）有家可歸者，遣送回籍。（二）入伍前有職業技能，殘廢不妨碍其工作者，使其恢復舊業。（三）因殘不適於恢復舊業，或原無職業技能者，予以職業再造，並介紹其職業。（四）志願務農者，授田耕種。（五）有相當學歷之青年，志願繼續求學者，予以深造機會。（六）完全喪失工作能力，而無家可歸者，繼續留院贍養之。實施上項計劃，第一步應先行辦理除役及退伍，由政府發給較優厚之退役或退伍金，願回籍者，並給予足用之旅費，此後無論其回籍，就業，授田，或求學之殘廢軍人，仍按年分等發給贍養金至終身，以示崇德報功。此項經費，爲數雖鉅，但尙有賴政府勉力支付。惟上項計劃如欲全部實施，一，必須各地交通無阻，社會秩序恢復；二，經濟恢復正常狀態，農工商業能普遍發展。現在各地共匪尙未肅清，以上條件，尙未具備，殘廢軍人之安置，擬先從東南西南各省着手，再逐漸推及於華北各省。</p>
<p>（四）軍風紀之整飭，與官兵生活之融和：一·軍風紀之整飭：軍風紀爲軍隊之命脈，西部曾不斷着力於此，主要以直系管理爲中心，再建立各級監察制度，並輔以憲兵力量，其辦法如左：1　組各行轅，各總部，各綏署監察機構。2計劃派遣師以上部隊機關之監察官，實施全面監察。3於中訓　訓練監察人員，派遣任用。4以上級監察下級爲主，輔以憲兵之力量。二·軍法審判及戰犯之處理：1各級軍法機關，分設軍事檢察科或檢察官，自卅五年六月至卅六年七月，經辦結之檢察案件六八八二件，直接審理四五七件，審結案件辦結五一一七起2現正計劃於各鐵路綫區，設置軍法監督執行機構。3戰犯之處理，另設各地軍事法庭，計已審理終結者七八二人，死刑者九三人，各地尙覊押者六九九人。4爲判決徒刑之戰犯集中執行起見，正籌備於上海成立戰犯監獄一所，以資管理。三·關於官兵生活之融和，爲期士兵生活不致偏枯，官兵生活不致脫節，使達部隊即家庭，部隊即學校之境，本部措施之概要如次：1新聞局本年編訂之新聞工作實施綱要，其要旨爲指導官兵注意營養，實行新生活，指導士兵組織伙食管理委員會，協助整理佈置營地環境，改善衛生醫藥，現各部隊已設中山俱樂部者一五·三六五所，並隨時對全體官兵舉行歌詠演劇，放映電影，提倡髙尙娛樂。2倡行意見公開，經理公開，是否公斷，賞罰公斷之新風氣，組織紀律監察評判會，時事座談會，小組討論會等。3爲使官兵一體，生活一致，訂定官兵生活考查實施辦法，規定各級部隊長，率同新聞工作人員，每天視察一個連，考查官兵生活情形，並與官兵共同操作飲食。4對於傷病官兵物質與精神之慰問，本部規定部隊長暨新聞工作人員，應每週訪慰一次，或派代表訪慰，但部隊長仍應每月訪慰一次。（未完）</p>

<h3>卅七年度的本市預算</h3>
<p>卅七年度的本市預算，大致已擬定了：其歲出入總數，各爲九八三，八一九，二一九，九四四元，收支相抵，居然平衡，自可令人欣慰。</p>
<p>日前外傳：市府各單位所擬歲出預算之總數，實達二，一四七，六一二，一三三，七一九元，超過收入，計達一，一六三，七九二，九一三，七七五元，如此鉅額的赤字，凡是關心本市財政的人，無不深爲焦慮；惟恐出入過鉅，明年度的預算案，將無法編得起來；並恐將另籌大宗收入，以資抵補，致驟增市民的負担。而結果收支數字，勉强適合，且並未另闢稅源，這關鍵全在乎分別緩急，將此一萬餘億的鉅額超支，悉歸納在所謂新興事業費項下，另行提開，暫時作爲懸案，事實上，即等於變相的駁回；這不但是編製上一種巧妙的技術，亦實是主管機關職權上應有的措施。因爲現在各地方政府，以種種牽制，本不易定出整個的施政方案來；各單位各就所見，各定所需，其支出總額，自不易與收入總額相脗合。且在這百廢待舉，物價昴貴的時候，共所要求的費用，又安得不超過收入？在這種情形之下，主管機關，如果照單全收，不予准駁，則非悉索敝賦，大增負担，勢必束手無策，形成僵局。所以另立項目，暫時作懸案，我們還認爲是人情上力求緩和的作用；實　　駁者，不妨明白駁斥；應緩者，便可決定從緩；　是編製預算的通例，也是莫可避免之事實。我們並不是說：所謂新興事業之中，沒有十分切要的在內，也就是說：各單位的原來要求，並非一定不緊要的。但是限於財力，無從應付，便不得不斟酌先後，有所取去了。</p>
<p>這次擬編的預算案，還有幾點，很値得注意：（一）是職員薪給，悉照本年度實有的員額計算，那麼，再度緊縮的傳說，大約不可靠；或至少，在市府方面，總是主張維持現狀的了。（二）臨時費一項，照本年原預算及追加預算，以三倍計列。這項預計，是否準確，因尙待將來事實的證明，但也可以默窺日後物價的趨勢。（三）其中經常費和生活補助費二項，却悉照現支給標準核准。生活補助費是由中央規定的，除酌列準備金以資應付外，在目前自無從估計；但經常費並未增加，將來事實上有無困難，似是問題。（四）所謂新興事業費，其收入尙無着落，原可一律從緩。但其中有幾筆增加的費用，聞均經核定，已在所必需。這筆款項，雖爲數不大，却也不得不另行調整，以期確定。</p>
<p>以上係就支出而言，其收入部門，此本年度所列的二五三，五九〇，二六六，七二二元，計增加七三〇，二二八，九五三，二二二元。據聞此項數字，在估計時，尙屬核實，當無虛收實支之弊。但遺產稅雖經循案列入，却從無收入，自特種營業稅劃歸中央後，營業稅列一千二百億，仍比本年增列一倍有餘，娛樂稅列八百億，亦比本年增列五百二十八億，而禁舞一舉，已勢在必行；照此看來，將來實際上的把握如何，亦頗可注意。</p>
<p>在這物價動盪之秋，編製預算，本是一件極困難之事。現距新預算的實施，爲時尙有四月，目前估計，縱使十分準確，到爾時能否符合實際，亦還是問題。即如本年預算，原衹二千四百餘億，而據會計處宣佈，到年底時，實支數恐須超過五千億元。那麼，單就預算論預算，其實際上的意義，遠不如承平時期之重要。故在收支方面，雖不可不力求切實，以期編成一部良好的預算，而在另一方面，却不得不希望整個的經濟，形勢好轉，務求物價穩定，幣値穩定，乃至稅源有盈無絀，而後種種預算，方可與理想日益接近。</p>

<h3>各國應協力安定　全世界貨幣金融　遠東需要援助甚於歐洲　國際貨幣基金總董發表剴切見解</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕國際貨幣茶金總董古特今日向國際銀行及國際貨幣基金會董事會等會提出其每年報吿，謂遠東之需要貨幣援助，尤在歐洲之上。中國·緬甸·菲律賓及其他遭日本侵略諸國，經濟均極殘破，若不給予貨幣援助，則世界貿易之恢復可能將爲之遲延數十年。歐洲之復興，大部份僅實質問題，而遠東之破壞則已打擊整個世界貨幣制度之根本。遠東在破產狀態下，世界決不能繁榮。中國之通貨膨脹，雖似與他國無關，但中國貨幣價値之低落，將使美國之貿易受損，因而引起失業勞工等問題。今世界貿易呈顯著的不平衡狀態，戰爭之惡果猶不及世界破產之半。世界經濟復興，實爲當前急務。今歐洲十六國方在巴黎協商歐洲復興之需要，此舉豈爲已足。世界各國應一致協商，以覓取互助制度。歐洲之需要若與遠東相較，猶不免相形見拙。故盼世界各國得以立即注意亞洲尤其是中國之經濟混亂狀態。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕國際銀行總裁麥克洛埃今日向該行理事會發表常年報吿，略謂，歐洲復興之重大問題，仍爲糧食燃料與人力。歐洲本身對於此類問題之解決，必須有重大貢獻。外來之援助果然重要，但僅爲全部努力之一小部份。若干國家之情形，實堪注意，但歐洲國家尙可繼續採取有益與重要之步驟，殆無疑養。最重要步驟之一，乃在恢復金融安定，金融之安定，又須自預算平衡，賦稅健全及竭力撙節不必要開支着手。此外，亞洲，非洲，中東與拉丁美洲之財政發展計劃，不久亦將　本行之重大關切。當然本行不能一手包辦，甚至不能完成此項任務之重大部份。</p>
<h3>歐洲十六國經濟報告　克萊頓表不滿　西歐復興工作遭遇挫折</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十一日電〕美副國務卿克萊頓之嚴厲批評討論馬歇爾計劃之歐洲十六國會議之報吿，或將使該報吿重新編制，而原定星期一舉行之十六國會議末次全體大會，可能亦將延期。</p>
<p>克萊頓昨在此間美大使館晤十六國會議之五强執行委員會，即十六國歐洲經濟合作委員會與專家委員會間之聯絡機構，解釋美國對該會報吿書之反響達兩小時之久，其主要之批評有下列數點：（一）缺乏十六國間自相互助之適當規定；（二）報吿書所提之需要數字，作爲集體需要之數字，而無各個團家之需要數字；（三）關於恢復歐洲貨幣交兌之建議尙缺乏準確性。克萊頓復指出歐洲國家尙未有積極廢止相互間貿易壁壘。此外歐洲國家尙未成立諒解，使某一國剩餘之勞工及物資得爲缺乏此等勞工及物資之其他歐洲國家所使用。克萊頓並謂：歐洲十六國被邀擬具共同報吿書，並非表示每一國家毋需與美國個別討論，美國事實上有與每一國成立個別協定之意向。據十六國會議之人士稱：報吿書之未能區別各個國家間之需要，乃英國代表團之過。由於歐洲之支付平衡狀態，泰半由於英國之故，因此英代表團贊成提出集體之數字。十六國會議之報吿書係九月八日提出，估計今後四年內歐洲十六國對美洲大陸之入超總額爲二百二十四億九千九百萬元，計一九四八年八十億另四百九十萬元，一九四九年六十三億五千萬元，一九五〇年四十六億五千萬元，一九五一年三十四億五千萬元。</p>
<h3>恢復戰時租借法　美認爲難以實行</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十一日電〕此間高級方面談稱：英國殆曾提出美國重在和平時代施行租借條例之建議，但美國已予拒絕據悉，美國出席國際銀行與貨幣基金會議代表答覆關於英國曾否直接向美國提出和平時代援助戰後紊亂國家一項建議之詢問時稱，此事或屬有之，但拒不說明其詳細情形。故衆料美國殆已認爲不能實行，而加以拒絕。</p>
<h3>撙節美元支出　英採新措施</h3>
<p>書籍轍入亦須許可證</p>
<p>〔路透社偷敦十二日電〕英政府對於克里浦斯商相赴陶却斯特旅舍向企業及勞工領袖五千人宣布其增加出口計劃前之數小時，於今晨宣布撙節美元限制輸入之兩項新措施。商務部宣布自十二日起，書緒不能自由輸入英國，必須個別請頒輸入許可證，音樂及廣吿材料亦受回樣限制。査外國雜誌英文小說及兒童書籍前已採用輸入許可證制，今日宣布之新辦法’將使各種印刷品幾均受到同一限制。同時糧食部亦宣布在續發通吿前，即日起限制若千種水菓之輸入，如瓜桃李等。其他若干水菓蔬菜若小檸檬，無花菓，黑洋梅，胡瓜，　等，須採用個別輸入許可證。其他若干種蔬菜在缺貨期內亦採用輸入管制制。</p>
<h3>克里浦斯呼籲　英須自力更生</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十二日電〕英商務大臣克里浦斯十二日宣布，英國須在經濟上獨立，不能希望任何美國援助。英國應儘速努力增高出口三分之一，以挽救經濟崩潰。克里浦斯指同英國圖存之應取途徑後稱：「空前之嚴峻辦法將無限期維持，或許其程度將有加無已。」</p>
<h3>聯合國大會開會期近　馬卿啓程赴紐約　三項重大問題亟待大會處理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：下週二舉行之聯合國全體大會，對於世界和平，將極爲重要。議程中充滿炸藥性之問題，據消息靈通方面稱：美國決在此次會議中，與蘇聯攤牌，觀乎馬歇爾親自出席一點，即可獲得證明。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日自此間出發赴紐約，出席本月十六日啓幕之聯合國大會。馬卿顧問稱，馬氏星期三向大會致函，將爲美國政策之重大啓示，以爭取非蘇聯及蘇美間之國家。渠將明白表示美國將成爲其外交政策之基石。</p>
<p>美國在過去之表現，並未被世界全盤接受，馬卿聲望隆盛，此次自任美代表團長，當可增加美國力量。馬氏另一目的，爲使大會不顧蘇聯之反對，在希境成立一「邊界監視」團。按蘇聯在安理會中曾否俠美國在此方面之努力。蘇職方面馬歇爾之敵手爲副外長維辛斯基。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十二日電〕本屆聯合國大會定九月十六日在紐約弗魯辛塲揭幕，會員國雖已自五十五國增爲五十七國，（增加葉門巴基斯坦兩國），然整個聯合國機構之未來命運，仍握於五强之掌握中。關係觀察家預料，本屆聯大會乃恢復聯合國機構聲譽之最後一次機會。最樂觀之觀察家亦認本屆聯大，將爲聯合國機構歷史上之轉捩點，成敗悉繫於此。巴爾幹問題，否決權問題，巴勒斯坦問題均爲本屆大會必須處理之重要問題。</p>

<h3>蘇聯凱覦伊油權聲中　美發表重要聲明　伊朗有權自由支配國內資源</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十一日電〕美駐伊朗大使艾倫，今日向伊美關係協會致辭，表示美國支持一伊朗之自由決定支配其資源。伊朗之資源屬於伊朗，得由伊朗贈與他人，或縱出高價仍拒絕出讓。美國不問建議之是否爲商業性，但若此等建議輔以敵意的威脅，或危險的聲明，則美國將不能不表示關切。美國抱有解除世界侵略威脅之決心，伊朗人民可以信賴美國之決定支持伊朗之抉擇自由。艾倫發表此項演說之際，正値伊國會將討論批准伊蘇石油協定之際，顯具有特殊用意。</p>
<h3>英煤礦工潮結束</h3>

<h3>莫洛托夫　下月出席聯夫　將提驚人動議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十二日電〕可靠方面稱，蘇外長莫洛托夫擬在十月加到達紐約，向聯大會提出驚人建議。消息靈通人士甚至拒絕暗示莫氏意外之行之性質。去年莫氏在大會中取得主動權，主張　世普遍軍縮，此次莫氏恐亦有同樣聳人聽聞之計劃。</p>
<h3>調查印荷停戰情形途中　英澳兩總領遇狙　爪哇荷軍佔區秩序混亂</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞十一日電〕荷蘭通訊社稱，英駐吧城代理總領事蘭勃特及澳駐吧城總領事伊登，在爪哇東部馬朗區荷軍區內視察時，遭人開槍射擊。兩氏係應安理會之邀，調查停戰令施行之情形。彼等係於星期二離吧城赴泗水，轉赴馬朗一帶視察。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞十一日電〕我駐巴達維亞總領事蔣家棟，於各地視察二日後，已與比領事返轉吧城。據蔣氏稱：蘇甲巫眉城中，即白晝亦不安定，佩槍之印尼共和國人，時常殺人越貨。如前日即有一華僑婦人，及其女婿，在離城四公里之宅中被殺。</p>

<h3>華萊士演說　抨擊美外交政策　對胡佛路綫攻擊尤烈</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十一日電〕十一日爲華萊士被迫去職一週紀念日，華氏在此間馬迪森方塲演說，聽衆擁擠，座爲之滿。華氏稱美國刻正執行前總統胡佛所領導三反動外交政策。自渠去年發表演說攻擊美國對蘇「强硬」外交政策以後，美民主共和兩黨已進入反共競賽，此競賽將產生仇恨及戰爭恐怕病。華氏攻擊「所謂自由派人士」，彼等在內政方面對胡佛之經濟及政治觀念多所抨擊，然對於美國外交政策係走胡佛路綫一事，則自甘盲目。華氏云：「有人指責吾人企圖控制民主黨，不如說吾人起而阻止民主黨之自殺較爲妥貼，軍人及投資銀行家刻正操縱外交；在共和黨治下，華爾街控制美國，在現政府治下華爾街決意控制世界」。如胡佛之之觀念「續爲吾國外交之南針」，則戰時之犧牲一切均爲枉然。美國現行外交政策以自由爲名，實則包庇反動。如吾人能愈早知其廬山眞面目，吾人即可愈能避免戰爭，不必費去重大代價，準備戰爭。</p>
<h3>吉田茂證實　將組新政黨</h3>
<p>蘆田稱和約明春可簽訂</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕頃在北海道作旅行演講之自由黨總裁吉田茂，昨出席旭州市該黨市支部大會時，曾就最近傳說之組織新黨運動，堅決表示：爲挽救國家之危機，使兩大政黨並立，互相競爭。以求進步，實有必要。近日盛傳余擬組織新黨，但事實上尙無具體活動。本人僅希望有强力之內閣擔當媾和會議，因此痛感有以自由黨爲中心，組織强力而單一之保守政黨之必要。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕日外相蘆田十一日抵大阪談稱：據一般情勢推測，對日和約可能於明春簽字。關於美國貸款問題，現已締結六千萬美元之棉貸款，一般人最焦慮之日元對外匯率問題，恐在和約簽字以前，無從決定云。</p>

<h3>四行二局定期减薪　全體員工具呈力爭　代表表示薪小之職員所减最多　另一方面稱低級職員無多大影響</h3>
<p>國家行局員工减薪，四行二局已定本月廿日發薪時開始遵令實施。各該行局員工對此極表惶恐，昨已全體簽名具文呈請各該行局負責人，勿减薪津。據員工代表表示，此次核定减薪之數字，全體一律，依此比例，底薪小之職員，减薪最多，低薪大之職員，减薪最少。此次請求設無結果，將再繼續力爭。目前各機構之待遇，國家行局員工之薪津所得并不高，而公務人員之待遇實太低，故欲增進行政効能，使公務員安心工作，不如提高公務人員之待遇云。</p>
<p>另據中央社記者昨向可靠方面探悉，裁員問題，國家行局刻尙未有具體計劃。至於待遇，四聯總處已依照行政院命令，對國家行局有所指示，各行局將遵照規定，作合理之調整。幷悉，國家行局待遇，其高低級職員之間，目前已無顯著差異。因戰事發生以來，國家行局調整職員待遇時，已充分顧及低級職員生活，其底薪愈低者，增加倍數愈高，如以戰前行員待遇比照，其高低級職員之問之差異倍數，已逐漸减少，幾至接近。故此次縮减待遇，低級職員決不致受有特殊影響。外傳練習生辦事員等待遇將打六折七折各節，完全不確。</p>

<h3>正稅八倍征收　副稅不給收據　財部徐州直接稅局長　邵祖蘭大貪汚　證據確鑿經地院提起公訴</h3>

<h3>淄埔礦區踏勘　「鬥爭之家」</h3>
<p>〔本報淄川六日航訊〕在最近，共匪把階級鬥爭的鴻溝掘得愈深愈廣，由「土地鬥爭」的「土地還家」而「資產鬥爭」的「掃地出門」，近來更由「掃地出門」進而至「流血鬥爭」的「石頭燉肉」，讓人間世的血海深仇越來越兇了！</p>
<p>我這次在淄博，嘗訪間了好幾個被鬥爭之家，其中一家是同業，現任濟南正報記者程白樺兄家，他住在太尉廟後街廿三號，他的父親經營了一所振業煤礦日可採煤百餘噸。共匪侵佔傳山期間，他</p>
<p>全家逃亡</p>
<p>到濟南，匪於發動鬥爭時，乃只得用一紙牌寫上他父親的名字，代表他父親，然後邀集民衆舉行鬥爭大會，把他家中所有家具以及礦井礦塲設備全部鬥爭得一乾二淨。另外一家是博山人普遍遍認爲最德高望重的公正士紳張煥宸，凡是博山人，有任何疑難糾紛不能解決時，經他排解，無不折服。張今已七十八歲，是前淸進士，當過知縣，在本縣担任過十年商會會長，現任本縣參議員。子，蓮溪，年五十九。孫六，其中五位在青島，據說在青他家尚開有一家銀號，全家大小共州二口，地三十餘畝，房屋兩大幢。他有一出服族孫張敬濤在匪中任政委，在匪佔博山期問，張當把他呌來訓了一頓。在八路準備第三次放秉博山前六日（八月十一日），他家的天門首先被共匪「博山大街鎮聯合善後委員會」貼上封條加了鎖，隨後他和他的家人都被迫着參加共匪「翻身委員會主席」劉正翔主持的鬥爭大會，此在共匪即所謂「鎖門開會」，在一套實際上村幹控制的大會裏他的罪名就被決定爲「老封建老頑固暗刀殺人不見血」的「蔣根」，今天就要「創蔣根」，並說他戰時由日寇侵佔燒石灰勝利後歸還原在秋谷的五畝地是侵佔了老百姓的，並謂强佔了三十餘畝之多，所以要鬥爭，要翻身。接着就通過並將他家裏所有家其雜物鬥爭得正如掃地一樣乾淨，這在共匪所加的新名詞就是所謂</p>
<p>掃地出門</p>
<p>。鬥爭會終了後，張及他的孫子被押在報恩寺，十二，十三兩日遊街，在他的頭上並戴上一個高達三尺餘的紙帽，上書「前淸進士，民國知縣，國民黨參議員張煥宸」，遊街時有老百姓見他這大年紀，請求准許他坐一下，亦喝令不准，當日有同時遊街的崔趙兩「封建」即被石砸死，這在共匪即所謂「石頭燉肉」。十四日，張初被砸，幾次痛得死去活來，他的孫子在旁目不忍覩，要求參加八路以贖祖之命，不允，要求替死亦不准，晨後張終被陷入</p>
<p>石頭燉肉</p>
<p>的苦厄而致死，張臨死前，告其子曰：「以後不要再學我，我一生未做虧心事，結果是落得如此下塲」！</p>
<p>張死後，其家屬收屍時擬盛殮之，匪亦不准，迄今仍用一薄皮棺材　厝於伍家嶺！當記者詢間他的孫子爲什麼共匪未加害於他而只要他陪同遊街時，他告訴我，「這在共匪是呌揹蔣芽子！目的是要做給我看看，知道他們的厲害！</p>
<p>張家房子在西關街，一所三進，一所爲一大四合院子，記者往訪時，他們因國軍到來，已撤回家裏居住，惟因</p>
<p>家具雜物</p>
<p>被鬥爭後，已只剩一空殼，家裏的人還多睡在地板上，代表王兼主席前往宣撫的范處長奇俊除致慰問之意外，並答應他們只要能認出他們的原件，都可以請梁縣長汝代爲追回。</p>
<p>此外，據胡影援部新聞室王主任炎清語記者，當他們的部隊於八月十六日進駐王村時，他目擊在路側河谷幾塊</p>
<p>大石板下</p>
<p>一連被壓着十二個人，萬中十一人已被壓死，一人名　福堂，經國軍將青石從他身上抬去後，知道他們都是被匪鬥爭，先用石頭，木棍，或者刀斧，或砸或打得要死不死時，再以巨石壓其身上，以供衆覽。博山青年團桑主任告訴我，博山離城三四里外，直到現在，土八路仍在作普遍而劇烈的鬥爭，僅源泉（博山東南五十華里）一村，一天以內，慘遭「石頭燉肉」的苦刑者，即已達四十九人之多。（特派員麗天）</p>
<h3>淄川大箱籠　等候原主具領</h3>
<p>〔本報淄川六日航訊〕淄川「鬥爭」較博山爲尤烈，據縣府初步調查，全淄川被鬥爭的達一萬八千餘戶，被鬥爭致死者一千七百餘人，被匪據去者六千三百餘人。城區方面，被鬥爭者三百七十餘家，去年原有門市商號五十餘家，酒店醬園業廿餘家，皆被鬥爭一空，炭業磁業各十餘家亦大部被鬥爭，城內有一家最大的　豐永醬園鋪存有野菜廿餘萬斤，此次亦被鬥爭一空，城區每人平均分七十斤。淄川縣政府內迄今尚有彼匪鬥爭來的大批箱寵。藏滿幾間屋子，等待原主前來領取。</p>
<p>共匪這樣漫無止境的「鬥爭」，「富農」而「中農」，甚至十畝左右的自耕農亦在鬥爭之列。淄川城外的十里鋪共爲七十五戶，已由共匪村幹鬥爭了五家，耿參議員占元及其弟之家皆被鬥爭，共匪至此，猶以爲未足，其村幹開會決定鬥爭四十家，民衆知之，忍無可忍，乃合力將三位村幹綁送匪公區所，結果匪更換了地三位，此議始罷，九月一日又有五人續被共匪綁架而去。因此在記者遍訪魯中各地農民後，他們一致的結論是：所謂「鬥爭」，所謂「翻身」，是富的變窮，窮的更窮，愈鬥愈窮，越翻越深！」</p>

<h3>經委會審查小組會主張　審核紗廠生產成本　產紗品質出口數量等亦須嚴格規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於全國經委會組織審查小組會，審查經部提議之發展紡織工業調劑紗布供需實施方案經過，一部已探誌昨日本報。茲悉：審查小組會審查方案意見，除決定：（一）加强聯合配銷，將國民營紗廠產紗，全部集中配銷；（二）統一收購國棉，暫從綏議兩點外，尚有審查意見數點：（一）各廠生產成本，顧予嚴格審核。成本過高之廠，應由紡調會派員督導减低。產紗品質，應予嚴格鑑定等級。（二）出口紗布，以紗布總生產量百分之二十爲限度。（三）各紗廠計算棉紗利潤時，不得以原棉包括在內。（四）複　業之製成品價格，亦應嚴加管制，以示公允。聞該項審查意見，尚須提交全經會討論，如獲通過，將由經濟部　據該項通過之審查意見，修改原有方案，然後再提全經會作最後之核定云。</p>
<h3>華股反動回漲　多種高價結束</h3>
<p>華股昨露曙光，先有英匯牌價掛縮，外股之十分俏利，繼有紗布限期提貨之說，游炎似將由物資方面，轉移陣地，證劵帮咸具奢望，不時聲援，使低後反動回漲。除永公增資，難洽衆意，獨跌半成外，頗多以高盤結束。　晨初因隔前交換國行大差進，人心不免疲怯，現永紗更經二二三號之做手，開低至二三五元，使餘股咸感失色。開後即有散賣補空，永紗自即交二二五元，遞交二三五元起，逐步回好，餘股亦泰半由低盤拉上。八九號等進現永紗，二三二號等亦進遞永紗，逐步拉高至二三九元及二四五元。經二一八號趁高供給，一三三號亦了結現永紗，曾回跌至二四〇元。外股漲風大盛，一一七號等來買，曾數度回上至二四五元，終遭廣帮二一八號之乘高供售，不免遭受阻遏。</p>
<p>延至十一時後，外股及物資之助買不已，一一六號等紛購，中絲會由六一號掛高至漲停板，近午更聞紗布限期出倉，引起統制流言，游資轉移陣地，證劵帮多方加碼，永紗步漲到二四四元及二五二元之價收市。除永公外，餘股亦均被帶上至高價收市。收後永紗喊價稍形恍惚。</p>
<p>結果較前收即交股計永紗景福中法微升，信和美亞華豐新光勤興各漲半成，永公獨跌半成，新華麗安尚平，中絲曾告漲停，軋升一成强，餘均微升。遞交股計信和美亞勤興各漲半成，永紗華豐景福新光微升，塲外各老股榮辱不一，內計大生見挫，而中華世界華商則稍漲。</p>
<p>又訊：據悉，本市證劵交易所自去年九月九日成立，迄本年九月八日止，一年間之股票成交總金額，達二〇，二二二，二四三，四四七，五四五元。交易稅共達九，九六一，二八一，三七五元。</p>

<p>外股昨更見興奮，證劵帮買氣更狂，洋商亦止售轉買，銀行帮及廣帮略售，難遏漲風。英匯掛縮，怡紗晨開一〇四邏輯思〇〇〇元，自一〇三五〇〇元起，盤升至一〇八五〇〇元結束。結果較前收計業廣紙業尚平，墾植漲二成弱，怡紗好起一成弱，鋼業微升，餘者均漲半成。</p>
<h3>美匯照原價　英滙升二千</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯市價，昨經外匯平衡基金委員會核定，英匯基準價調整爲十二萬二千元，較前漲二千元。依比例推算其他外幣基凖價，港幣爲七五九三·二二元，盧比爲九一一八元。美匯基準價仍維四萬〇五百元原價，昨日指定銀行買賣價，英匯進十二萬〇五百元，出十二萬三千五百元。港幣進七千五百元，出七千七百元。臘比進八千九百七十元，出九千二百七十元。</p>

<p>茶豆北方略動，再升三五千元，蠶豆另化熟閙，續漲萬元。紅糧北洋動辦，猛漲萬元，苞米靑島選高納取，步挺三五千元，惟中次依然胃呆乏神，且提高殺次甚烈。元麥堅定。生仁廣帮略有成交，形趨定局。芝蔴洋莊微動，彫勢站定。</p>
<p>油市上落甚微，略有參差，生汕消化轉振，回高萬元。豆油漲風太銳，去胃見淡，回　萬元。淸油軟化，榮油平正，蔴油彷彿，配油價格不動。</p>
<h3>食糖績軟</h3>

<h3>外傷可使老病惡化</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>小的時候歡喜看小說，看到某人「受傷之後患病在床繼綿數月而死」，心裏總以爲是一種過份的渲染，事實上決定不會有這種事情，因爲據常理推測，傷重了在數天之後可以致命；受傷輕呢，在調養了一些時期之後當然會全愈起來，決計不會有受傷了數月之後方始致命的。至於技擊餘聞方面所說的什麼「敵人受了某種點穴重手法後可以在數月或半年之後死亡」之類更加是虛無玄妙無信可徵了。</p>
<p>後來我研究醫學，也沒有改一變過這種信念。可是自從在滬行醫之後所見所聞感觸實多，’以前所有的信念，逐漸被意想不到的奇蹟動搖了。下面所述的事實就是本文所指的一種例子：</p>
<p>「有一個五十三歲的男子，體格向來强壯，營養狀態亦佳。家中人有患結核症者，惟其本人則從未有任何患病之記錄。</p>
<p>在去年十一月廿六日午飯時分（彼此時完全康健，且正在某處工作）因急速走隱伏於雪堆中之鐵絲網，不愼將右足鈎住於鐵絲內，彼立即向前斜覆，將前胸重撞於硬地上，其右胸受撞尤重。因其傾跌時作九〇度之斜遷姿勢，是以彼之右胸受傷甚重。似乎彼之肺臟亦受影嚮，但不久即行恢復不以爲苦。返家之後亦無所苦，惟晚間偶有胸疼及胸悶而已。</p>
<p>次日因微有不適遂在家休息一日。</p>
<p>於受傷八天後（即十二月四日）自覺身體完全康復，遂前往公共浴室沐浴。十二月六日彼外出搭乘街車，忽然吐血數口即行返家。十二月八日即進醫院診治。此時用X光檢查肺部，則見兩肺炎及右肺下葉均有石灰化病灶。在兩肺門附近亦有此石灰質病灶。此種症象當然可以認爲是已經硬化之初期性結核病灶之組合（Toc.　Primaercomlpex）。其兩肺炎皆有西門氏式結核病灶。血球沉澱反應度數爲10/20mm。至於血液方面之全部檢查完全是健康狀態。自十二月七日至九日內，微有熱度，但旋即退减。嗣於十二月十九日及廿日則有熱度高至卅八·六度，但經治療之後即行退淸，以後共有七天無熟。但自十二月卅一日起至今年元月十日止，又再發熱。</p>
<p>於今年正月十一日（即受傷後之第四十六日）起忽有高熱，兼作無數塞戰，此時根據臨床視察已可診斷爲粟粒性結核症（即爲最惡性之結核症）之發作矣。茲誌其X光檢查情形如下：</p>
<p>（一）十二月八日（即受傷後之第十二日）兩肺清晰無病。兩肺下角正常。橫隔膜有少許灣曲之處。兩肺門黑影增大，右肺門有石灰質硬化之舊斑點，成小集團狀態。此當然爲初期性之老結核症組合。而其初期侵蝕之老病灶亦可於氣管分枝處清晰認明。文在左肺門亦有少數之石灰質化結核病灶。其中有少數病灶恰在心影之左上房近處。（待續）</p>
<h3>江南流行的日本吸虫病（續完）</h3>
<p>— 沈落</p>
<p>第二期自幼虫變成虫後，至肝，脾腫大止。此時病者大便帶血及粘液，有如痢疾，起初裏急後重，日泄十餘次—在顯微鏡下即可在大便中尋出虫卵—腸，鼻，齒齦，子宮等粘膜出血，月經不調，貧血，體重日减，消瘦虛弱，心悸亢進，呼吸困難，睡液分泌亢進，或口渴，胃痛，吞酸，嘈雜，吐血，曖氣，胃部有停滯壓重感，肝，脾腫大，下午熱度加甚，體內受成虫的破壞日甚一日。</p>
<p>第三期如未經治療，遷延數年後，肝，脾硬化萎縮，有壓痛，表面高低不平，門靜脈鬱血，此時病勢嚴重，起惡性循環障碍，腹中積水，（膨脹）尿量减少，榮養障礙，深度貧血，下肢浮腫，夜盲及視力退化，血中嗜酸性白血球增加，球蛋白質沉澱試騐，呈陽性，膝蓋反射亢進，終至衰竭不治而死。</p>
<p>本病也可就症狀的急緩，區分爲急性型與慢性型，急性型幾星期或二三月可告痊癒，但易復發；慢性型二三年或一二三十年終至全身衰弱而亡。流行在蘇南農村中俗稱的「大肚病」，「臌脹病」就是這種血　病。</p>
<p>己，預防與治療預防重於治療，早期治療頗有痊愈希望，若肝，脾損壞已深，甚至心腦受累，則難挽救。血　病特效藥，過去以三原子價的銻製劑，如酒石酸銻鉀Stiblc-Kali　Tartaricum或浮士Fosadin,　Stibosan,　Neo-Stibosan用靜脈或肌肉注射，每隔一日注射一次，以注射十二次爲度，慎勿過量，而致中毒，惟近時醫家多不引用。</p>
<p>吐酒石爲治療本病效力最大之藥物，治療後約有百分之八十五患者　使中可不再有發現虫卵；惜毒力稍大，於注射後常有發熱，嘔吐，腹瀉，咳嗽等副作用。德拜耳廠出品之福銻Fuadin，肌肉注射初用一，五西西，繼以三至五西西，隔日注射一次至總量四十西西爲止；若糞中仍有虫卵，則可於二星期後續行注射。其優點爲反應較輕，惟效力較小，每多復發；且現在市價甚昂，每盒十針，售卅萬元左右——福銻應用，據江蘇省蘇南地方病防治療所臨床報告，注射該藥完成治療的病人二十四人內，大便復檢無虫卵者十三人54.2%，病狀减輕者八人33.3%，病重不治死亡者三人12.5%云。（詳見拙編「蘇南防治月刋」第一卷第一期，三十六年七月一日出版）</p>
<p>美國亦有福銻針出品，我國信誼藥廠最近出品「聖露斯銻新」Solu-Stisin　五價銻製劑，自較三價銻進步），對血　病及黑熱病，頗有治療價值？</p>
<p>此外應用奎寧，鐵劑，亞砷酸Acid.　Avsenisosum等行滋養療法，並投與瀉劑亦爲重要；如能轉地療養，尤佳。</p>
<p>預防要點，積極防止此病，在根本殺滅日本血　及中間宿主（釘螺　），如撒石灰或硫酸銅液布汞濱以滅螺，挖深有釘螺　的河床，加深河灘之斜度，使螺無地繁殖等；但所費極鉅，以我國目前農村經濟情形而論，不能普遍做到。</p>
<p>消極辦法，當有賴衛生教育的普及，加强防治宣傳，改善環境衛生，在血　病流行區域，尤其重要的有二點：</p>
<p>第一，關於公共方面的—厲行糞便管理，並嚴密管理患者，因爲患血吸病的病人，大便往往含有虫卵，爲傳染血　病的媒介，輾轉傳播害人，所以我們必須做到的兩點如下（當然需要政治的力量推進）</p>
<p>一，嚴禁馬桶便器在河流中洗滌。</p>
<p>二，用糞便施肥時，萬勿採用新鮮糞便；應該使用陳糞，至少要放置十天，（冬天至少一月），使糞便發酵，以滅幼虫，虫卵，而策安全。</p>
<p>第二，關於個人方面：</p>
<p>一，不要在有釘螺螄的河池中游泳或洗滌。</p>

<p>三，耕種，捕魚，排水，凡須下水作業時，要穿長膠靴，或油布靴，細布長襪，以保護腿足，免爲血　尾動幼虫的侵入。</p>

<h3>所謂「口渴多屎病」之我見</h3>
<p>— 土吉誠</p>
<p>近見王　榮醫師在本刊發表之「漫談兒童口渴多尿病」，深佩其診餘研究之精神。王醫師復徵求醫界同人及病家供給有關資料，用就筆者之所聞見與親歷者，據陳二，聊備參證。</p>
<p>所謂「口渴多尿病」之病理，仍有待吾人繼續探討；但據日本慶應醫科大學小兒科教授唐澤光德博士對於同類病症之意見，認係乳幼兒體溫調節中樞尚未發育究全，致其體溫易隨氣溫之上昇而成正比例增高。此不僅在夏季爲然，即在夏季以外，試用湯婆子三四個，裹以棉被將此類幼兒臥於其中，可能發現有十二十九度至四十度之高熱，若於此時撤去湯婆子或减少衣被，可使體溫急速下降，故當氣溫較高之炎夏，幼兒常有原因不明之持續發熱，高達三十七度點五以至三十九度以上，並無其他症候可資佐　：一　外氣轉涼，體溫自然恢復常態；苟在變熱時爲之沐浴，體溫可减退。此等病例均可視爲由於體溫調節中徧之機能不全，而構之爲變熱（Stauungs　fteber）。其他學者亦有稱本病爲夏期發熱者，名雖不同，但其臨床所見及理論大致無異。</p>
<p>就筆者本人之診治經騐，此類患兒每年夏季均多遇之。兒齡愈小，發熱愈高，體溫有外至三十九度或四十度以上者，但一切檢查，均無特別異狀發現，氣溫轉凉，熱度亦退。同一患者次年再發時，則發熱較輕，持續時間亦較短；若第三年仍發，其發熱更輕，持續時間亦更短。雖間有併發他症者，但稍治即癒，惟熟度非至天凉時不退。至如王醫師文中所稱傳染之說，筆者尚未得到實證；腹瀉之象，亦未見其必有。其治療方法，除使病兒靜臥外，首重營養。在藥物方面，對發熱較高且久者予以Vitamin　B.　及强心藥等，經過都屬良好，尚未見有不良結果者。</p>
<p>另有先經筆者診治斷爲本症後又轉請他醫認係消化不良或傷寒者，因而减少其榮養，於是發熱更高，再來求治，筆者仍施前法，熱度又較輕，月餘之後天氣凉爽，乃復常溫。於此可見現在對於本症既無特效療法，增其榮養當然必要；至於遷地療養或住於有冷氣設備屋中，理應有效，不過病家經濟條件能適合者鮮耳。</p>
<h3>上海市醫師公會　代電一則</h3>
<p>上海市醫師公會爲南京地方法院法官蔑視法醫及醫事機關，人證物證又無確切反證，而任意判決南京市立醫院醫師錢明熙徒刑，表示憤激，昨特代電請司法院司法行政部，衛生部，最高法院，首都高等法院，全國醫師公會聯合會，及各地醫師公會，主持公道。茲將原電照錄如下：各院部會鈞鑒：讀京滬各報，並接各地醫事團體函電，對南京地方法院法官蔑視法醫及攻事機關，人證物證又無確切反證，而任意判決南京市立醫院醫師錢明熙以過失殺人，處刑一年六月，均抱異常憤激，以爲今後將使醫家失法律保障，危病致羣醫袖手，影響所至，阻碍科學建設，危及民族健康，騰笑國際醫界，本公會羣情惶惑，人人自危，仰祈鈞（院，部，會），力特公道，維護方萌醫學，不勝　切之至。上海市醫師公會理事長余靈率二千會員同叩眞印。</p>

<h3>Important Resolutions Passed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the KMT: Central Party and Youth League Unified; Seventh National Congress to Convene on May 5th Next Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Kuomintang's Fourth Plenary Session held its second meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 3 PM this afternoon. Zou Lu presided over the meeting. The Secretariat reported that 95 Executive Committee members, 32 Alternate Executive Committee members, 42 Supervisory Committee members, 18 Alternate Supervisory Committee members, 262 observers, 28 Central Youth League Affairs personnel, 9 Alternate Affairs personnel, 21 supervisors, and 9 Alternate supervisors were present, constituting a quorum. The following were then discussed: (1) the party's current organizational program proposal; (2) the proposal to unify the central party headquarters and youth league headquarters. Both of these proposals had been passed by the joint conference of the central party and youth league and were presented to this meeting for discussion. As a result of the discussions, both were amended and passed. According to the party's current organizational program, it is the second part of the Kuomintang Reorganization Program. The General Assembly considered that there was no need to separately formulate the current political program and changed the name of the original program to "The Kuomintang's Current Organizational Program" for submission to the plenary session for discussion. Regarding the unification of the central party headquarters and youth league headquarters, except for the modification of the word "uniformly" to "all changed" in the first item of the measures, the rest remained unchanged. (3) The proposal to convene the Seventh National Congress on May 5, 1948, was unanimously approved by acclamation immediately upon its presentation. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM. The draft declaration of the General Assembly prepared by the Declaration Drafting Committee will be presented for discussion tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The joint conference of the central party and youth league continued at 9:45 AM on the 12th, presided over by President Chiang. The meeting continued to discuss the draft inspection of the Kuomintang Reorganization Program submitted by the Proposal Sorting Committee. The case was divided into two parts: "The Party's Current Political Program" and "The Party's Current Organizational Program". The former was studied in detail and it was considered that there was no need to formulate a new political program for this plenary session. Instead, it should focus on implementing the resolutions made by previous plenary sessions to achieve practical results. Therefore, it was not put to discussion. The organizational program was completely revised and passed. Subsequently, the proposal to unify the central party headquarters and youth league headquarters submitted by the presidium was discussed and also passed with amendments. After the passage of this proposal, President Chiang delivered a brief speech, stating: "This meeting considers this proposal to be the most important. Its passage by the General Assembly fully demonstrates our spirit of unity and lays the foundation for the party's rebirth. It is deeply believed that with this sincere and impartial spirit for the party and the nation, we can guarantee the success of suppressing the rebellion, the realization of the Three Principles of the People, and the completion of national construction." After listening to the instructions, all comrades were greatly inspired and applauded enthusiastically for a long time. The meeting adjourned at 12:01 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Kuomintang's current organizational program was revised and passed by the joint conference of the party and youth league on the morning of the 12th, and then sent to the Second General Assembly of the Fourth Plenary Session for discussion in the afternoon, where it was also approved. During the discussion, the entire case was debated only on two points: the registration of party members' property and the recruitment of party members. Regarding the registration of party members' property, some people believed that if there was no confidence in implementing it thoroughly, it should not be rigidly stipulated. However, this point was still passed. Regarding the recruitment of party members, Sun Ke advocated that freelancers should be recruited, and Liu Jianjing believed that women should also be included. As a result, Shao Lizi said that there was no need to add more items, and it would be appropriate to pay special attention to the recruitment of party members in the original articles. Everyone thought it was very appropriate and it was passed smoothly. Today's meeting proceeded quickly and smoothly, which may have been unexpected. On the morning of the 12th, the President also celebrated the satisfactory results of this harmonious atmosphere. The General Assembly may be closed after the meeting on the 13th.</p>

<h3>Liu Gongyun in Fuzhou to Participate in National Assembly Election</h3>

Among those participating in the National Assembly election in Fuzhou City are Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, the famous political commentator Sa Mengwu, and General Chen Xiaowei, among others.</p>
<h3>Full Meeting of the Central Supervisory Committee: President Instructs to Strengthen Supervisory Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Sixth Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang held its fourth plenary meeting at the committee's headquarters on Zhongshan East Road at 1 PM on the 12th. 75 members including Wu Jingheng, Zhang Ji, Wang Chonghui, and Shao Lizi attended. Peng Shaoxiang and Wang Lu, five supervisory committee members from the provincial and municipal party headquarters, were present as observers.

<h3>Research Association on the Japanese Peace Treaty Drafts Opinions on the Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Supervisory Committee members Yu Shude, Wan Can, Liu Shidu, etc., recently organized a Research Committee on the Japanese Peace Treaty, and more than a dozen supervisory committee members participated.

<h3>Rehabilitation Commission to be Established Soon; Subsidies for Public Utilities to be Gradually Reduced; Policy Guidelines for Next Year Will Not be Drafted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] In order to continue handling rehabilitation and relief affairs and taking over the unfinished business of the UNRRA headquarters that will be closed, the government has determined not to draft national policy guidelines for the period after the implementation of constitutional government, as it would be inappropriate for the current transitional government to do so. In order to prepare the annual budget for the 37th year of the Republic, a Rehabilitation Commission will be formally established soon. The main tasks of the commission are the reconstruction of the Yellow River flood area and the relief of agriculture and fisheries. In addition to establishing a Reconstruction Bureau for the Yellow River Flood Area, it will also organize a Deliberation and Custody Committee for Rehabilitation Affairs to plan financial resources, manage custody, and effectively use materials.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] During the State Council meeting on the 12th, it was decided on the issue of subsidies for public utilities to gradually reduce them depending on the situation, hoping to completely stop subsidies in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The proposal for drafting national policy guidelines for the 37th year of the Republic was previously discussed and resolved at the Executive Yuan meeting. It was considered that since national policy guidelines for the period after the implementation of constitutional government in the 37th year would not be drafted, it would be inappropriate for the current transitional government to do so. In order to prepare the general budget for the 37th year, all ministries and commissions only need to refer to the chapter on basic national policies in the Constitution and the Outline for Implementing Constitutional Government by Mobilizing to Suppress the Rebellion, and formulate the central work for the next year as a basis. The provincial and municipal governments should also follow this procedure when preparing the budget for the next year, so there is no need to draft the national policy guidelines for the next year. It was resolved at the State Council meeting on the 12th that the policy guidelines for the 37th year do not need to be drafted.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The National Government Committee held its eleventh State Council meeting at the National Government Conference Hall at 10 AM on the 12th, presided over by Vice Chairman Sun. 16 members including Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, and Zou Lu attended. First, according to the agenda, the reporting items were read out: (1) the plan to delineate a period to determine the election units for counties, cities, and equivalent areas; (2) the explanation that incumbent officials running for National Assembly representatives or legislators in the district elections of vocational groups should be subject to legal restrictions. Next, Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi reported on the recent military situation, followed by a discussion of the proposals: (1) the plan to send the impeachment of political officials and supervisory committee members to which agency for handling. It was resolved that the impeachment of political officials and supervisory committee members should be handled by the Political Official Impeachment Committee of the National Government. (2) The draft organization regulations of the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee, which was resolved to be passed and handed over to the Legislative Yuan. (3) The legislative member Lian Shenghai passed away due to illness, and the vacancy was filled by Zeng Ji, which was resolved to be passed. (4) The appointment of Ren Bingjun as a supervisory committee member of the Control Yuan, which was resolved to be passed. (5) Other financial budget proposals were also passed, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Number of National Assembly Representatives for Industrial and Commercial Groups Increased to 68; Allocation Method to be Determined by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The proposal to increase the number of National Assembly representatives for industrial and commercial groups has been passed by the State Council on the 12th, and it has been decided to increase it to 68. The allocation method will be determined by the Legislative Yuan. This important proposal was jointly submitted by the five government committee members Zhang Ji, Shao Lizi, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, and Wu Zhongxin. The main reason is that in recent months, commercial groups in various places have strongly argued for increasing the number of National Assembly representatives and legislators. Although the committee had previously resolved to increase the number of legislators by five, the groups believe that the total number of representatives for industrial and commercial groups is 31, which is 73 less than the previous session, and commercial groups only have 13, which is unfair. It is checked that the allocation of the number of National Assembly representatives in this session, the former National Defense Council had a resolution of "according to the proportion of the previous session", commercial groups should be given a considerable proportion. In terms of the organization of vocational groups, commercial groups are the most long-standing and widespread, and it seems that it is not appropriate to suppress them excessively. Moreover, during the War of Resistance, commercial groups bore a heavy burden, and currently, the suppression of rebellion and national construction still require the business community to bear its economic responsibilities. The allocation of too few places is not enough to show the government's fairness.</p>
<h3>Industrial Circles in Hebei, Pingjin Negotiate to Purchase the China Textile Company</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 12th] The industrial circles in Hebei, Pingjin are actively preparing to negotiate the purchase of the China Textile Company. Shi Zizhou, speaker of the Tianjin Provisional Assembly, said that the China Textile Company is estimated to be worth over 500 billion yuan, and the Tianjin business community can raise 300 billion yuan. The remaining funds and working capital of about 200 billion yuan will be requested from the industrial and commercial circles in Hebei, Peiping, and Henan, Shanxi provinces. Currently, the provisional assemblies and business leaders of Hebei, Pingjin, etc., will jointly telegraph the central government to approve the priority purchase of the China Textile Company.</p>
<h3>Fusi Nian Criticizes, Wedemeyer Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Chinese Senator Fu Sinian told reporters today that 90 percent of Wedemeyer's recent farewell statement in China was completely correct. The biggest shortcoming was that Wedemeyer did not make a quantitative analysis of the Chinese situation. Although the corruption of the National Government is limited to a few officials, these few officials occupy important financial and economic positions, and they should bear the main responsibility for the current situation. China's civil administration can be compared to the United States or other countries, but its military administration is far inferior. It is expected that the National Government will issue a statement on the results of the special envoy's investigation, which will be partly accepted and partly denied. The best assistance the United States can give to China is in administrative management, and it should be accompanied by internal government reorganization. Wedemeyer is quite popular in China, except among the communists. From the perspective of the Kuomintang, his position is even higher than that of Marshal Ma, and he is an ideal US ambassador to China.</p>
<h3>Our Map Printing Plates Seized, Allied Headquarters Orders Japan to Return Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Allied Headquarters today ordered the Japanese government to return all 5,270 map printing plates seized from our country during the war to their original owner. The above-mentioned printing plates are for printing maps of mainland China, Northeast China, Korea, Japan, Siberia, the Malayan Federation, and its neighboring areas.</p>
<h3>US Foreign Relief Plan to Begin Implementation in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] A portion of the United States' $350 million foreign relief plan is expected to be implemented in China within a few weeks. According to a State Department spokesman, negotiations with China on this assistance issue have been protracted and are now nearing completion. After that, relief matters can begin quickly, but the rumors in the Chinese political circles that $30 million has been earmarked for China in this fund are inaccurate, and the amount has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Agencies of Various Provinces and Cities Stranded in Shenyang; Advancement Locations Have Been Determined; Chen Cheng Summons Leaders to Instruct on Takeover Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 12th] Since Director Chen Cheng has been stationed in Shenyang, a new situation has unfolded in the entire Northeast. The governments of various unrecovered provinces and cities in the Northeast, which have been stranded in Shenyang for more than a year, are preparing to take action and advance to areas close to their respective provinces and cities, so as to be ready to take over at any time. When Chen summoned the leaders of various unrecovered provinces and cities a few days ago, he had instructed the advancement locations, approximately as follows: the government of Andong Province to be advanced to Hailong, the governments of Hejiang and Songjiang Provinces to be advanced to Yongji, the government of Nenjiang Province to the border of Liaobei Province, the governments of Xing'an and Heilongjiang Provinces and the Harbin Municipal Government to be temporarily stationed in Changchun, and the Dalian Municipal Government to remain in Shenyang for the time being. In principle, this is the case. The leaders of various provinces and cities have been holding meetings to discuss this matter, and it is said that they will soon submit their conclusions and difficulties to Chen for final decision.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] Chen Cheng works diligently and lives in the office of the Xing Yuan, sharing meals with senior Xing Yuan personnel. The meals are simple and time-efficient, and banquets are declined. Visitors are not allowed to smoke, and joint office work begins at 8 AM every morning. The heads of various units of the Xing Yuan gather in the director's office on time. The time is determined by the complexity of the affairs, and official business is resolved quickly and conveniently.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] The personnel of the Northeast Xing Yuan are now determined: Zheng Dongguo is the only deputy director, Dong Yingbin is the chief of staff, Dong Yanping is the deputy chief of staff, Chu Xichun is the chief advisor and commander of the Qianfang Defense, Zhang Xueming is the deputy chief advisor, Peng Jiqun is the secretary-general, Che Fanru is the director of the director's office, and Liu Muzeng is the deputy director. In addition, the entire Xing Yuan personnel will be reduced from 600-700 to more than 500 according to the prescribed establishment.</p>
<h3>British Parliamentary Delegation Scheduled to Depart on the 27th</h3>
<p>[British News Service, London, 12th] The British Parliamentary Delegation is scheduled to depart for China on the 27th. The London China Association will hold a grand farewell at the Chinese Research Society two days before the delegation leaves the UK.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Arrives in New York, Determined to Do Everything Possible to Promote the Success of the United Nations General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York Broadcasting, 12th: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrived in New York today to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Those who welcomed him at Port Lagardia Airport included Gu Weijun, Hu Shize, Guo Taiqi, Jiang Tingfu, and Chinese Ambassador to Canada Liu Kai. Wang told reporters that he believes that this meeting is critical to the success or failure of the future of the United Nations, and we should all do our best to promote its success. When asked when peace can be restored in China, Wang replied: "Whether in Asia or Europe, peace must be restored as soon as possible, otherwise the situation will deteriorate and reach a level that the major powers will not be able to control."</p>

<p>Random Notes from a Southern Trip, Part Five (Continued)</p>
<p>From the three-hour symposium in the "Coconut Kingdom" and the statements of local people I contacted over the next three days, I concluded that Hainan Island is being poisoned by the words "chaos" and "poverty."</p>
<p>In politics, issues are discussed but not decided, and decisions are made but not implemented (such as reforms). Local officials have responsibility but no authority. Bandit suppression plans repeatedly fail to be carried out, so that robberies on the highway in the Haikou city area have become commonplace. These are all signs of chaos.</p>
<p>Hainan Island's resources cannot be said to be scarce. Rubber, coconut oil, sugar, and seafood are the main products, which can replace part of those from Southeast Asia and Taiwan. In the past, the Japanese were determined to develop this area and established many factories. The Eastern Hydroelectric Power Plant project was intended to supply electricity to the entire island, and even the island's ring railway was planned for electrification. However, after the takeover, theft and dismantling for sale became rampant, and everything fell into disrepair. I once visited a nutrition factory (producing soy sauce and canned goods). The scene made me want to cry. Any Chinese person with a sense of national consciousness would cry upon seeing that situation. Productive enterprises have all been shut down. Good people travel far across the ocean to make a living, while others go into the mountains to become bandits, relying on robbery and looting. As a result, able-bodied men flee. The villages are full of women, children, and the elderly. Therefore, Hainan Island is now only surviving on remittances from overseas Chinese. The only business of several banks in Haikou is to transport banknotes from the mainland.</p>
<p>Preventing a fire before it starts is unrewarding and thankless, and very laborious; but frantically rescuing after a fire has already broken out brings applause and cheers from everyone. This kind of political atmosphere has caused many people to not start with foundational work, but only to think about speculating and seeking shortcuts to gain merit.</p>
<p>Cai Jinjun is in Hainan Island and very much wants to make a difference. He is from Wenchang and is willing to serve his hometown. According to common sense, he would never do anything that would be sorry to the elders and folks in his hometown. Perhaps precisely because he is eager for achievements, some places are inevitably dissatisfied with him. However, this dissatisfaction, when analyzed, is close to destructive criticism. For example, before the War of Resistance, Hainan Island was like a place beyond civilization. When the government orders were unified, the War of Resistance broke out, and it was occupied. Now that victory has been achieved, many unprecedented taxes are suddenly imposed on them, which they cannot understand or tolerate. They mostly believe that this is harassment after the commissioner took office. The illegal corruption during the takeover period is still being discussed by the people of Hainan as a fresh issue. They miss a commander Chen dispatched by Chen Jitang during his rule in Guangdong. They almost emotionally blame all the current suffering on the current situation. This is naturally not a fair judgment.</p>
<p>Being isolated overseas is due to insufficient transportation conditions. This easily creates estrangement and also easily creates corruption. Up to now, there is still no direct ship between Shanghai and Haikou, and there is no regular shipping line between Guangzhou and Haikou, and the air service between Guangzhou and Haikou is only once a week. If this status quo continues, it will be a great obstacle to the development of Hainan Island. Nothing is more urgent than transportation. The biggest frustration for the people on Hainan Island seems to be the feeling of being forgotten by the country.</p>
<p>I mentioned bandits above. In Hainan Island, they are indeed native bandits. This group of desperadoes has no ideology, doctrine, or organization at all. Their so-called "democracy" is nothing more than a cover-up, to make themselves sound louder. Previously, Hong Kong had rumors that Li Jishen had some organized activities and that military supplies were being provided to the bandits on Hainan Island, etc., but the Director of the Headquarters Zhang Fakui and the Bandit Suppression Commander of the Ninth District Cai Jinjun both denied it unanimously. Due to the nature and language, it is almost impossible for a person from another province, or even a Guangdong person from outside Hainan Island, to join the bandits here. This can also be proven by looking at the bandit situation survey statistics chart made by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Precisely because of this situation, the bandits on Hainan Island are both easy and difficult to suppress. Locals who fled to the rear during the War of Resistance, as well as locals who have worked in Southeast Asia for decades, excitedly rushed back to their hometowns after the victory, hoping to see their elders and homeland, but they had to stay in Haikou, look at their homeland dozens of miles away, and return home. How can they not feel sorrow?</p>
<p>Politics is more important than military affairs. At least in Hainan Island, this is the supreme guiding principle for bandit suppression. The current authorities are currently doing their best to conduct a thorough census of households and establish a chain of Baojia system. If this is done thoroughly, it will definitely be effective in eliminating banditry. However, at the same time, it is also necessary to start from the economic aspect to stabilize the people's lives.

<h3>Many Enemy and Puppet Properties in Northeast China Not Yet Transferred</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] The total value of enemy and puppet properties already taken over in Northeast China is 1.2 trillion current notes, but only 3 billion yuan have been processed for transfer. Because the central agencies often misunderstand "takeover" and "take possession," many of the enemy properties taken over have not been processed or transferred, and they want to obtain property rights. The local governments also often believe that enemy and puppet properties should be returned to the local governments and allow the local governments to use them. This is indeed a misunderstanding. The takeover work in the Northeast has passed, and the main focus now is on accurate figures for compensation claims against Japan.</p>

The agreement between the Guangdong Provincial Government and the National Resources Commission has been signed by both parties the week before, and preparations are being made to apply for a loan of approximately US$5 million from the United States for electrical machinery and supply of electric wires, with the future income of the plant as collateral. Mr. Gordon, an American hydropower consultant sent by the National Resources Commission to inspect, went to Yingde by Yuehan Railway car on the 11th. It is heard that the drawings of the entire plant will take three months to complete, and the biggest problem now is the machinery, because it takes three years to deliver the custom-made electrical machinery.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou-Kowloon Through Train Resumes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 12th] After the settlement of the engineers' strike, the Guangzhou-Kowloon train service was restored through service on the 12th because the notice of resumption of work was issued too late on the evening of the 11th.

<h3>Political Integrity in One Corner of Shandong Province; Communism Unable to Invade; American Reporter Praises Commissioner Zhang's Achievements</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 11th] The New York Herald Tribune commented on the Chinese situation yesterday, saying: "In Shandong Province, China, a reporter for the Howard newspaper found several districts where communism has never gained a foothold. This reporter, Mr. Newton, inquired about the reason why the Red Army could not enter this area, because these situations are very satisfactory from the American point of view. He learned that the commissioner of this area, Zhang Tianzuo (transliteration), is an honest man who is doing sound work like in any war zone. General Zhang's problems are of course difficult, but he has solved them one by one. He organized a committee to transport supplies by plane and export local products at the same time. The section of the Jiaoji Railway under his jurisdiction is open and unobstructed, although other places have been destroyed by the Communist Party. He taxes merchants, but he did not put the money into his own pocket. He used the money to feed tens of thousands of refugees. He organized an obstetrics hospital. He obtained many books and built many schools for rural children. He used DDT to kill insects, thereby improving the general health of the people. His work, beyond the expectations of any Chinese, made it impossible for communism to arouse people's interest in this area."</p>

<h3>Bai Chongxi's Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang – Full Text (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>(3) Compensation for Casualties and Placement of Disabled Soldiers: 1. Officer and Soldier Compensation: Regarding the disbursement of compensation measures by this Headquarters in the past year, the main points are described as follows: (1) Revising the system, relaxing the standards for documentation, and striving for accuracy and preventing abuse; revising the procedures for dependents to receive compensation; comforting the families of officers captured or missing in action; adjusting compensation payments in a timely manner by referencing the standards for army payments and the amount of severance pay. (2) Simplifying procedures, promoting postal salary payments, simplifying compensation claim procedures, widely establishing compensation inquiry offices, and simplifying the twelve types of application forms into one each for "injury" and "death" compensation claims, which are produced and distributed to post offices, institutions, troops, and local governments for claimants to use. (3) Strengthening manpower, establishing battlefield compensation agencies to assess and disburse compensation locally. (4) Entrusting medical examinations to military or public hospitals in various regions to save claimants from difficulties. (5) Establishing a compensation fund management committee to earmark compensation funds as a special national fund, not included in military expenditures, to protect the legal rights of compensation recipients. (6) Issuing honorary certificates, conducting commendations, awards, honoring the loyal and brave, erecting monuments, and holding public funerals. (7) Providing preferential treatment for employment, job referrals, accommodation, education, and free schooling for the children of the injured, disabled, and deceased soldiers. (8) For the reward and compensation of civil servants who die in the line of duty while defending territory, this Headquarters will first investigate the circumstances of the operation and make a preliminary assessment before submitting it to the Executive Yuan. 2. Placement of Disabled Soldiers: During China's war of resistance against Japan, over 70,000 soldiers were disabled due to injuries. The rehabilitation of these disabled soldiers, in addition to consolidating and streamlining management institutions, will be handled by the relevant departments to properly draft a placement plan. The main points are roughly divided into the following categories: (1) Those with homes to return to will be sent back to their hometowns. (2) Those who had vocational skills before enlisting and whose disability does not hinder their work will be allowed to resume their former occupations. (3) Those who are unable to resume their former occupations due to disability or who had no vocational skills will be given vocational retraining and job placement assistance. (4) Those who volunteer to farm will be granted land for cultivation. (5) Young people with considerable academic qualifications who volunteer to continue their studies will be given opportunities for advanced education. (6) Those who have completely lost their ability to work and have no homes to return to will continue to be supported in hospitals. To implement the above plan, the first step should be to carry out retirement and demobilization, with the government issuing relatively generous retirement or demobilization pay. Those who wish to return to their hometowns will be given sufficient travel expenses. Thereafter, whether returning to their hometowns, finding employment, being granted land, or pursuing education, disabled soldiers will continue to receive annual stipends for life to demonstrate respect for virtue and reward for merit. Although the amount of this expenditure is large, it still depends on the government's efforts to pay it. However, if the above plan is to be fully implemented: 1. Transportation throughout the country must be unimpeded, and social order must be restored; 2. The economy must return to normal, and agriculture, industry, and commerce must be widely developed. Since the communist bandits have not yet been completely eliminated in various regions, the above conditions are not yet met. The placement of disabled soldiers is planned to start in the southeast and southwest provinces first, and then gradually extended to the North China provinces.</p>
<p>(4) Rectification of Military Discipline and Harmony in the Lives of Officers and Soldiers: 1. Rectification of Military Discipline: Military discipline is the lifeblood of the army. The Headquarters has been constantly working on this, mainly focusing on direct management, establishing supervisory systems at all levels, and supplementing them with military police forces. The methods are as follows: 1. Organizing supervisory institutions for various headquarters and garrison commands. 2. Planning to dispatch supervisory officers to units and agencies above the division level to implement comprehensive supervision. 3. Training supervisory personnel at the Central Training Corps and assigning them to posts. 4. Subordinate units are mainly supervised by their superiors, supplemented by the strength of the military police. 2. Military Justice and Handling of War Criminals: 1. Military justice organs at all levels have established military procuratorate sections or procurators. From June 1946 to July 1947, 6,882 procuratorial cases were handled, 457 cases were directly tried, and 5,117 cases were concluded. 2. It is currently planned to establish military justice supervision and enforcement agencies in various railway line areas. 3. Regarding the handling of war criminals, separate military courts have been established in various regions. A total of 782 cases have been tried and concluded, with 93 people sentenced to death, and 699 people are still detained in various regions. 4. In order to centrally execute war criminals sentenced to imprisonment, preparations are being made to establish a war criminal prison in Shanghai for management. 3. Regarding Harmony in the Lives of Officers and Soldiers, in order to prevent soldiers' lives from becoming monotonous and to prevent the lives of officers and soldiers from becoming disconnected, to achieve a state where the troops are like a family and the troops are like a school, the main points of the Headquarters' measures are as follows: 1. The key points of the News Bureau's Implementation Outline for News Work, compiled this year, are to guide officers and soldiers to pay attention to nutrition, practice a new life, guide soldiers to organize food management committees, assist in organizing and arranging the environment of the camp, and improve health and medicine. Currently, 15,365 Sun Yat-sen Clubs have been established in various units, and singing, acting, and film screenings are held for all officers and soldiers from time to time to promote noble entertainment. 2. Advocating a new atmosphere of openness in opinions, transparency in management, fairness in judgment, and impartiality in rewards and punishments; organizing discipline supervision and evaluation committees, current affairs forums, and group discussions. 3. In order to make officers and soldiers one entity and have consistent lives, the Implementation Measures for Examining the Lives of Officers and Soldiers have been formulated, stipulating that unit leaders at all levels, along with news workers, should inspect one company every day to examine the living conditions of officers and soldiers, and operate and eat together with officers and soldiers. 4. Regarding material and spiritual comfort for wounded and sick officers and soldiers, the Headquarters stipulates that unit leaders and news workers should visit and comfort them once a week, or send representatives to visit and comfort them, but unit leaders should still visit and comfort them once a month.

<h3>The City Budget for 1948</h3>
<p>The city budget for 1948 has been roughly drafted: the total amount of revenue and expenditure is 983,819,219,944 yuan each. Revenue and expenditure are balanced, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>It was rumored a few days ago that the total amount of expenditure budgets proposed by various city government units actually reached 2,147,612,133,719 yuan, exceeding revenue by 1,163,792,913,775 yuan. Such a huge deficit has caused deep anxiety to all those concerned about the city's finances, fearing that the excessive imbalance would make it impossible to prepare the budget for the next year, and fearing that large amounts of revenue would have to be raised to offset the deficit, leading to a sudden increase in the burden on citizens. However, the final figures for revenue and expenditure are barely balanced, and no new sources of taxation have been opened up. The key lies in distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent matters, and classifying the huge amount of overspending of more than one trillion yuan under the so-called new business expenses, to be raised separately and treated as a pending issue. In fact, this is equivalent to a disguised rejection. This is not only a clever technique in budget preparation, but also a necessary measure within the authority of the competent authorities. Because it is not easy for local governments to formulate a complete policy plan due to various constraints. Each unit determines its needs based on what it sees, and the total amount of expenditure is naturally difficult to match the total amount of revenue. And at a time when everything is waiting to be rebuilt and prices are soaring, how can the costs requested not exceed revenue? Under such circumstances, if the competent authorities accept everything without approval or rejection, they will inevitably be forced to exhaust all resources and greatly increase the burden, leading to a deadlock. Therefore, establishing a separate item and temporarily treating it as a pending issue is considered a human effort to seek moderation. Those that should be explicitly rejected may be explicitly rejected; those that should be postponed may be decided to be postponed; this is a common practice in budget preparation and an unavoidable fact. We are not saying that there is nothing important among the so-called new business ventures, but rather that the original demands of various units are not necessarily unimportant. However, limited by financial resources, there is no way to meet them, so it is necessary to consider priorities and make choices.</p>
<p>There are several points in this draft budget that are worth noting: (1) The salaries of staff are calculated based on the actual number of staff this year, so the rumor of further downsizing is likely to be unreliable; or at least, the city government is always advocating maintaining the status quo. (2) The item of temporary expenses is listed as three times the original budget and additional budget for this year. Whether this estimate is accurate remains to be proven by future facts, but it can also provide a glimpse into the future trend of prices. (3) However, the two items of regular expenses and living allowances are all approved according to the current payment standards. Living allowances are stipulated by the central government, and aside from earmarking reserves to cope with them, there is currently no way to estimate them; but since regular expenses have not increased, it is questionable whether there will be difficulties in the future. (4) The revenue for the so-called new business expenses has not yet been secured, and could originally be postponed across the board. However, it is said that several of the increased expenses have been approved and are deemed necessary. Although this amount is not large, it must be adjusted separately to ensure its availability.</p>
<p>The above is in terms of expenditure. In terms of revenue, the amount listed this year is 253,590,266,722 yuan, an increase of 730,228,953,222 yuan. It is said that this figure was estimated accurately and there should be no abuse of collecting revenue without actual expenditure. However, although inheritance tax has been included according to precedent, there has never been any revenue from it. After the special business tax was transferred to the central government, the business tax listed at 120 billion yuan is still more than double that of this year, and the entertainment tax listed at 80 billion yuan is also 52.8 billion yuan more than this year. Given that the ban on dancing is inevitable, it is worth noting how reliable these revenue estimates will be in reality.</p>
<p>In this autumn of volatile prices, preparing a budget is an extremely difficult task. There are still four months before the implementation of the new budget, and even if the current estimates are very accurate, it is still questionable whether they will conform to reality by then. For example, this year's budget was originally just over 240 billion yuan, but according to the accounting office, the actual expenditure by the end of the year is likely to exceed 500 billion yuan. Therefore, looking at the budget alone, its practical significance is far less important than in times of peace. Therefore, while efforts must be made to ensure that revenue and expenditure are realistic in order to compile a good budget, on the other hand, it is necessary to hope that the overall economy will improve, strive to stabilize prices and the value of currency, and ensure that tax revenues are surplus rather than deficit, so that various budgets can gradually approach the ideal.</p>

<h3>All Countries Should Cooperate to Stabilize Global Currency and Finance. The Far East Needs Assistance More Than Europe. The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Expresses Incisive Views.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, December 12] The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Gutt, today submitted his annual report to the boards of directors of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund, stating that the Far East needs more monetary assistance than Europe. The economies of China, Burma, the Philippines, and other countries invaded by Japan are extremely devastated. Without monetary assistance, the recovery of world trade may be delayed for decades. The reconstruction of Europe is mostly a matter of substance, while the destruction in the Far East has struck the very foundation of the global monetary system. The world cannot prosper if the Far East is bankrupt. Although inflation in China may seem unrelated to other countries, the decline in the value of the Chinese currency will harm U.S. trade, leading to problems such as unemployed workers. World trade is currently showing a significant imbalance. The evils of war are not even half as bad as global bankruptcy. The recovery of the world economy is the most urgent task at present. The sixteen European countries are currently negotiating the needs of European reconstruction in Paris, but is this enough? All countries of the world should consult together to find a mutual assistance system. Compared to the needs of Europe, the Far East pales in comparison. It is hoped that all countries of the world can immediately pay attention to the economic chaos in Asia, especially China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, December 12] The President of the International Bank, McCloy, today issued his annual report to the Board of Directors, stating that the major problems of European reconstruction are still food, fuel, and manpower. Europe itself must make significant contributions to solving these problems. External assistance is indeed important, but it is only a small part of the overall effort. The situation in some countries is indeed noteworthy, but there is no doubt that European countries can continue to take beneficial and important steps. One of the most important steps is to restore financial stability, which must start with balancing the budget, sound taxation, and striving to economize on unnecessary expenditures. In addition, the financial development plans of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America will soon be of major concern to the Bank. Of course, the Bank cannot do everything on its own, and cannot even complete a major portion of this task.</p>
<h3>Economic Report of Sixteen European Countries. Clayton Expresses Dissatisfaction. Reconstruction Efforts in Western Europe Encounter Setbacks.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, December 11] U.S. Undersecretary of State Clayton's harsh criticism of the report of the conference of sixteen European countries discussing the Marshall Plan may lead to a revision of the report, and the final plenary session of the sixteen-nation conference, originally scheduled for Monday, may also be postponed.</p>
<p>Clayton met with the five-member executive committee of the sixteen-nation conference, namely the liaison body between the sixteen-nation European Economic Cooperation Committee and the expert committee, at the U.S. Embassy here yesterday, explaining the U.S. response to the conference's report for two hours. His main criticisms were: (1) Lack of adequate provisions for mutual assistance among the sixteen countries; (2) The needs figures presented in the report are collective needs figures, without the needs figures for each individual country; (3) The recommendations regarding the restoration of European currency exchange lack accuracy. Clayton also pointed out that European countries have not actively abolished trade barriers between them. In addition, European countries have not reached an understanding to allow surplus labor and materials in one country to be used by other European countries lacking such labor and materials. Clayton also said that the sixteen European countries were invited to prepare a joint report, which does not mean that each country does not need to discuss individually with the United States. In fact, the United States intends to conclude individual agreements with each country. According to people at the sixteen-nation conference, the failure of the report to distinguish between the needs of each country was due to the British delegation. Because the European balance of payments is mostly due to Britain, the British delegation supported submitting collective figures. The report of the sixteen-nation conference was submitted on September 8, estimating that the total trade deficit of the sixteen European countries with the American continent in the next four years will be $22.499 billion, including $8.049 billion in 1948, $6.35 billion in 1949, $4.65 billion in 1950, and $3.45 billion in 1951.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Considers It Difficult to Reinstate the Lend-Lease Act.</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, December 11] High-level sources here said that Britain had almost made a suggestion to the United States to implement a lend-lease ordinance in peacetime, but the United States has rejected it. It is reported that U.S. representatives attending the International Bank and Monetary Fund meeting, in response to inquiries about whether Britain had directly proposed to the United States a peacetime aid to post-war chaotic countries, said that this may be the case, but refused to explain the details. Therefore, it is expected that the United States has considered it impossible to implement and has rejected it.</p>
<h3>Britain Adopts New Measures to Economize on U.S. Dollar Spending.</h3>
<p>Book Imports Also Require Permits.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, December 12] The British government announced two new measures this morning to economize on U.S. dollar import restrictions, just hours before Commerce Secretary Cripps went to Dorchester House to announce his increased export plan to 5,000 business and labor leaders. The Ministry of Commerce announced that from the 12th, books cannot be freely imported into Britain and must be individually applied for import permits. Music and advertising materials are also subject to the same restrictions. Foreign magazines, English novels, and children's books have already adopted the import permit system. The new measures announced today will subject almost all types of printed matter to the same restrictions. At the same time, the Ministry of Food also announced that before reissuing a notice, it will immediately restrict the import of certain kinds of fruits, such as melons, peaches, and plums. Other certain fruits and vegetables, such as small lemons, figs, dried plums, and cucumbers, etc., must use individual import permits. Import control systems will also be adopted for certain other types of vegetables during periods of shortage.</p>
<h3>Cripps Calls for Britain to Be Self-Reliant.</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, December 12] British Trade Minister Cripps announced on December 12 that Britain must be economically independent and cannot hope for any U.S. aid. Britain should strive to increase exports by one-third as soon as possible to save the economic collapse. After pointing out the path that Britain should take to survive, Cripps said: "Unprecedentedly severe measures will be maintained indefinitely, perhaps even to an increased extent."</p>
<h3>The United Nations General Assembly is Approaching. Marshall Departs for New York. Three Major Issues Urgently Need to Be Addressed by the General Assembly.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, December 12 Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly, which will be held next Tuesday, will be extremely important for world peace. The agenda is full of explosive issues. According to well-informed sources, the United States is determined to have a showdown with the Soviet Union at this meeting, which can be proven by Marshall's personal attendance.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, December 12] Secretary of State Marshall departed from here today for New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, which opens on the 16th of this month. Marshall's advisors said that Marshall's letter to the General Assembly on Wednesday will be a major revelation of U.S. policy in order to win over countries between the non-Soviet and the Soviet-American blocs. He will clearly state that the United States will become the cornerstone of its foreign policy.</p>
<p>The United States' past performance has not been fully accepted by the world. Marshall's strong reputation and his assumption of the position of head of the U.S. delegation will increase U.S. power. Another of Marshall's goals is to establish a "border monitoring" team in Greece despite Soviet opposition. The Soviet Union has vetoed the U.S.'s efforts in this regard in the Security Council. Marshall's opponent on the Soviet side is Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, December 12] The current United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on September 16 at Flushing Meadow in New York. Although the number of member states has increased from 55 to 57 (adding Yemen and Pakistan), the future fate of the entire United Nations organization is still in the hands of the five great powers. Concerned observers predict that this General Assembly will be the last chance to restore the reputation of the United Nations organization. Even the most optimistic observers recognize that this General Assembly will be a turning point in the history of the United Nations organization, and success or failure depends on this. The Balkan issue, the veto issue, and the Palestine issue are all important issues that must be addressed at this General Assembly.</p>
<h3>British and American Troops Stationed in Italy Begin Withdrawal Today.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, December 12] The first batch of 3,000 British and American troops withdrawing from Italy paraded through the streets of Rome to the train station this morning, and citizens cheered and bid farewell along the way. In the coming weeks, British and American troops will continue to withdraw one after another, and all troops will be withdrawn within 90 days after the peace treaty takes effect. Italian Prime Minister Gasperi and Lieutenant General Lee John, acting supreme commander of the Allied forces in the Mediterranean region, conducted a farewell review at the Palazzo Venezia. The troops being withdrawn this time are those originally stationed in the Mogen Line area on the border of southern Italy.</p>
<h3>The United Nations' Expenses Require More Than $39 Million. China Bears 6%.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, December 11] It was learned today that the United States has agreed to continue donating to the United Nations' budget of $39.4 million for at least one year, accounting for about 40% of the total. The United Kingdom is second, accounting for 11.48%. The Soviet Union accounts for 6.34%. China and France each account for 6%. Secretary-General Lie declared that the 1948 budget increased by 48% compared to the past two years.</p>
<h3>Amidst Soviet Coveting of Iranian Oil Rights, the U.S. Issues Important Statement: Iran Has the Right to Freely Dispose of Domestic Resources.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, December 11] The U.S. Ambassador to Iran, Allen, said in a speech to the Iranian-American Relations Association today that the United States supports Iran's freedom to decide how to dispose of its resources. Iran's resources belong to Iran and may be given to others or rejected at a high price. The United States does not ask whether the proposals are commercial, but if such proposals are accompanied by hostile threats or dangerous statements, the United States cannot help but express its concern. The United States has the determination to eliminate the threat of aggression in the world, and the Iranian people can trust the U.S.'s decision to support Iran's freedom of choice. Allen's speech came as the Iranian parliament is about to discuss and approve the Iranian-Soviet oil agreement, which is obviously intended.</p>
<h3>The British Coal Miners' Strike Ends.</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, December 11] 2,000 workers at the Grimethorpe coal mine in Yorkshire today unanimously voted to return to work, ending the five-week strike. Labor figures said that 38,000 sympathy strikers will also automatically return to work.</p>
<h3>Molotov Will Attend the United Nations Next Month and Propose a Surprising Motion.</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, December 12] Reliable sources said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov plans to arrive in New York in October to present a surprising proposal to the General Assembly. Well-informed sources even refused to hint at the nature of Molotov's unexpected trip. Last year, Molotov took the initiative in the General Assembly, advocating universal disarmament. It is feared that Molotov also has a similarly sensational plan this time.</p>
<h3>While Investigating the Indonesian-Dutch Ceasefire Situation, British and Australian Consuls-General Were Sniped At. Order is Chaotic in the Dutch-Occupied Zone of Java.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, December 11] The Dutch news agency said that the acting British Consul-General in Batavia, Lambert, and the Australian Consul-General in Batavia, Eden, were shot at while inspecting the Dutch military area in Malang District, eastern Java. The two were invited by the Security Council to investigate the implementation of the ceasefire order. They left Batavia on Tuesday for Surabaya and then went to Malang for inspection.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, December 11] My Consul-General in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, has returned to Batavia after inspecting various places for two days with the Belgian consul. According to Chiang, the city of Sukabumi is unstable even during the day. Indonesians of the Republic of Indonesia with guns often kill and loot. For example, the day before yesterday, a Chinese woman and her son-in-law were killed in their home four kilometers from the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, December 11] Dutch Governor-General Van Mook denied that Chinese participated in the Dutch army, and also did not believe the Indonesian reports that some Chinese participated in the Indonesian war against the Dutch. He also said that the Dutch and Indonesian governments have allocated more than 2 million Dutch currency to relieve Chinese refugees.</p>
<h3>Wallace Speech: Criticizes US Foreign Policy, Especially Harshly Attacks Hoover's Line</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 11th] Today marked the one-week anniversary of Wallace's forced resignation. Wallace delivered a speech in Madison Square Garden, where a large crowd filled all the seats. Wallace stated that the United States is currently implementing the reactionary foreign policy led by former President Hoover. Since his speech last year attacking the United States' "hardline" foreign policy towards the Soviet Union, the Democratic and Republican parties have entered an anti-communist race, which will breed hatred and fear of war. Wallace attacked the "so-called liberals," who have criticized Hoover's economic and political views on domestic affairs, but have turned a blind eye to the fact that US foreign policy is following Hoover's line. Wallace said, "Some accuse us of trying to control the Democratic Party, but it is more accurate to say that we are trying to prevent the Democratic Party from committing suicide. Military personnel and investment bankers are now manipulating foreign policy; under the Republican Party, Wall Street controlled America, and under the current government, Wall Street is determined to control the world." If Hoover's ideas "continue to be the compass for our country's foreign policy," then all the sacrifices made during the war will have been in vain. America's current foreign policy is carried out in the name of freedom, but it actually protects reactionaries. The sooner we know its true nature, the sooner we can avoid war, without having to spend heavily on preparing for war.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Shigeru Confirms He Will Form a New Political Party</h3>
<p>Ashida Claims Peace Treaty Can Be Signed Next Spring</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Yoshida Shigeru, president of the Liberal Party, who was recently giving speeches while travelling in Hokkaido, firmly stated yesterday at the city branch convention of the party in Asahikawa City, regarding the recent rumors of forming a new party movement: in order to save the national crisis, it is necessary to have two major political parties standing side by side and competing with each other to seek progress. Recently, there have been rumors that I intend to form a new party, but in fact, there are no concrete activities yet. I only hope that a strong cabinet will be responsible for the peace conference, and therefore I keenly feel the necessity of forming a strong and unified conservative party with the Liberal Party as the center.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Foreign Minister Ashida, who arrived in Osaka on the 11th, said: judging from the general situation, the peace treaty with Japan may be signed next spring. Regarding the issue of American loans, a cotton loan of 60 million US dollars has already been concluded. The most anxious issue of the exchange rate of the Japanese yen is feared to be impossible to determine before the peace treaty is signed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Passes Economic Decentralization Plan; Fierce Debate to Unfold in Parliament; MacArthur's Headquarters Refuses to Withdraw Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The Katayama Cabinet today passed an economic decentralization plan, which will soon be submitted to Parliament for discussion. It is reported that this plan, which is being hotly debated by the Japanese government and the public, was given to the Katayama Cabinet by the Allied Headquarters. Katayama had an audience with MacArthur and his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Mueller, to request the withdrawal of the order, but was unsuccessful. The economic decentralization plan aims to smash the Japanese zaibatsu organizations and prevent the revival of any future monopoly control, but most people in the Japanese financial and economic circles believe that this plan will fragment Japan's economy. Chief Cabinet Secretary Nishio Suehiro declared today that the Cabinet will take the most prudent attitude so that the plan does not affect Japan's peacetime economic production and avoid causing "unease and disturbances." It is expected that after the new plan is submitted to Parliament, it will become an explosive center of debate.</p>
<h3>Japan Hopes to Join United Nations Organizations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The Central News Agency reporter exclusively learned today that the Japanese government hopes that after the countries that fought against it in the Pacific War sign a peace treaty with Japan, they will support its application to join the United Nations as a member.</p>
<h3>US Grain Exports to Decrease by 10% This Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The State Department revealed today that the US embassies and legations in eighteen countries, including China, India, and Pakistan, have been instructed to warn those countries that the US grain harvest this year is poor and that grain exports will be reduced by one-tenth.</p>
<h3>Delhi Turns Peaceful; Xinjiang Muslims Trapped</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 12th] Seventy Muslims (Kazakhs) from Xinjiang are currently trapped in the turbulent areas of Delhi and urgently need protection and evacuation to a safe area. After receiving a notification from one of them, the Central News Agency reporter immediately informed the embassy, which is currently considering the best method of protection.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 12th] Although patrols with shoot-on-sight orders are still active in the Delhi area, the nightmare of massacres, arson, and looting has apparently gradually disappeared. Trains have resumed operation, and military and political officials are actively discussing post-disaster plans.</p>
<p>[United Press International, New Delhi, 12th] A military spokesman announced on the evening of the 11th that plague has broken out in refugee camps, with 400 cases discovered in Kasur, Pakistan.</p>
<h3>Annam's Bao Dai Organizes Government in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hanoi, 11th] It is reported that the Provisional National Government of Vietnam, led by former Annam King Bao Dai, will soon be established in Hong Kong and will be recognized by the French government. This is the result of Vietnamese Governor Bollar's proposal to the French government for Vietnam's independence, which was rejected by Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh. French sources here expect that there will be a large-scale military operation in Vietnam in early October to break the resistance of the Viet Minh and establish a government led by Bao Dai.</p>

<h3>Four Banks and Two Bureaus Scheduled to Reduce Salaries; All Employees Submit Appeals; Representatives Say the Salaries of Low-Wage Employees Will Be Reduced the Most; Others Claim that Lower-Level Employees Will Not Be Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>Employees of national banks and bureaus will have their salaries reduced as scheduled, starting with the payment of salaries on the 20th of this month. Employees of the respective banks and bureaus are extremely apprehensive about this and have already collectively signed documents to appeal to the persons in charge of the respective banks and bureaus not to reduce salaries and allowances. According to employee representatives, the numbers of the salary cuts are the same for everyone; according to this proportion, employees with lower base salaries will have their salaries reduced the most, and employees with higher salaries will have their salaries reduced the least. If this request is unsuccessful, they will continue to fight for it. Currently, the treatment of employees in the national banks and bureaus is not high, while the treatment of civil servants is too low. Therefore, if they want to improve administrative efficiency and enable civil servants to work with peace of mind, it is better to increase the treatment of civil servants.</p>
<p>According to a reliable source at the Central News Agency yesterday, there are no concrete plans for layoffs in national banks and bureaus. As for treatment, the Joint Treasury has already given instructions to the national banks and bureaus in accordance with the orders of the Executive Yuan, and the banks and bureaus will make reasonable adjustments in accordance with the regulations. It is also understood that there is currently no significant difference between the salaries of senior and junior employees in the national banks and bureaus. Since the outbreak of the war, the national banks and bureaus have fully taken into account the lives of low-level employees when adjusting their salaries, and the lower the base salary, the higher the increase multiple. If compared with the treatment of bank employees before the war, the difference in multiples between senior and junior employees has gradually decreased, almost approaching. Therefore, low-level employees will definitely not be particularly affected by this salary reduction. The rumors that the treatment of trainees and clerks will be discounted by 60% or 70% are completely untrue.</p>
<h3>Civil Servant Salaries to Be Calculated According to Index; Senators Jiang Hao and Others Make This Suggestion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The fourth meeting of the Municipal Senate is about to be held, and it has received proposals from senators for several days. As of yesterday, there were a total of nineteen proposals, including those from Jiang Hao, Gao Shuan, and others, to stabilize the lives of civil servants, eliminate poverty and corruption, encourage the able and virtuous to enter politics, and improve political efficiency. They requested that the central government handle two points: (1) Regarding the adjustment of civil servant salaries, 1. Refer to the precedent of the Executive Yuan's Bureau of Material Supply, and civil servant salaries should be issued uniformly according to the cost of living index, starting from October of this year. 2. All cost-of-living subsidies and in-kind benefits previously given should be cancelled after the adjustment. 3. The additional expenses required after the adjustment should be handled by the Ministry of Finance in a unified manner to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. (2) Regarding the effective implementation of the personnel system, 1. Current civil servants who have been qualified by the Ministry of Civil Service Affairs or through selection should be guaranteed, and supervisors should not arbitrarily change them in the future unless they have made mistakes. 2. Those who have passed the examination but have not yet been employed should be assigned to jobs. 3. Those who have not been qualified should be gradually eliminated. 4. After the implementation of constitutional government, administrative officials should be employed through examinations.</p>
<p>Shi Bangfan also proposed a plan to organize the Shanghai Municipal Air Defense Headquarters as soon as possible, and Zhang Yiqu and others proposed to establish at least five municipal national schools in the Lao Zha District. The reason is that the district pays the most taxes, but no national school has been established there.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Recruitment Period to Be Extended; First Batch of 500 to Be Allocated to Us; Supervisory Committee Adjourns Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Supervisory Committee of the Conscription Association was originally scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss various issues such as supervision procedures, but there were not enough committee members present at the time, and it was not until 4:45 PM that a quorum was reached, resulting in adjournment. During this period of mobilization and frugality, the meeting time was wasted, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The 15th of this month is the original deadline for the completion of the recruitment of 3,000 volunteers in this city for this year. Now, for some reasons, it will be extended. It is reported that the first batch of 500 volunteers will be sent by the Municipal Government's New Recruit Recruitment Office to the Shanghai Garrison Command on the 15th, and the remaining 2,500 will be recruited before the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Heart Set on Serving the Country; Submits Letter Requesting to Enlist</h3>
<p>Since the start of conscription in this city, there have been citizens who volunteered to join the army. Previously, citizen Zou Siwen submitted a letter to Mayor Wu, volunteering to serve in the military. Now, citizen Zheng Kangnian, residing at No. 3, No. 86, Wu Family Alley, Yanmei Road, Nanshi, because he has exceeded the age of military service, recently submitted a letter to Mayor Wu, requesting a special recommendation for enlistment, and is willing to donate all the resettlement fee he receives to the Shen Bao Education Assistance Fund and the Memorial for the Martyr's Cemetery Memorial Tablet for the Anti-Japanese War. After receiving the letter, Mayor Wu sent a letter of commendation, considering him a model for the general youth.</p>

<h3>Sneaking into Rice Market; Fined Three Days of Detention</h3>
<p>After the police bureau's economic section sent personnel to strictly monitor the rice market for several days, rice prices were slightly more stable yesterday. At 9:30 AM yesterday, when economic police inspected personnel entering and leaving the market at the North Rice Market, they discovered eleven suspects who were suspected of sneaking into the market to speculate and manipulate prices. They were taken to the bureau for questioning. Except for He Zhujun and Lu Zhixiang, who had registration certificates for incoming goods, they were released. The remaining nine were fined three days of detention for violating market regulations. Their names are as follows: Tang Shouxian, Yan Chengtin, Gao Shirong, Yao Genhua (borrowed someone else's market entry permit), Cheng Zhiyu (used an expired market entry permit), Chen Yuqi, Shen Guoyu, Feng Dashu, Gu Zhigang (no market entry permit).</p>
<h3>Joint Association of Childcare Businesses to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association will hold the inaugural meeting of the Joint Association of Childcare Businesses in this city at the Young Women's Christian Association on Gordon Road at 4:00 PM this afternoon. Ms. Gao Junzhe will be invited to give a speech. It is also heard that the association will jointly organize a researcher for in-service staff of childcare centers in this city with the American Aid to China Association and the Young Women's Christian Association in October of this year, and is currently planning it.</p>
<h3>Huining Fellow Villagers Request Suppression of Bandits; Minister Bai Expresses Importance</h3>
<p>The Huining Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, because the banditry in the two Huining districts is frequent and the aftermath is worrying, specially sent representatives Yang Hu, Xie Renzhao, and Cao Zhigong to Beijing to petition the Ministry of National Defense and has now returned to Shanghai. It is said that when petitioning in Beijing, they were received by Minister Bai. In addition to reporting the recent banditry situation in the two Huining districts in a selected manner, the three representatives also requested the following matters: (1) Please send a large army to quickly suppress the banditry in Anhui Province to avoid it from spreading. (2) Strengthen local armed forces and urge people to defend themselves. (3) The self-defense team can be responsible for training by the garrison area, and weapons should be given by the central government to avoid local extortion in the name of raising funds, which would arouse popular resentment. (4) The training of local strongmen should be used for the local self-defense team and should not be transferred temporarily. Minister Bai expressed that he attached importance to the banditry situation in Anhui Province and that the requests would be considered within the possible scope. He hoped that the fellow villagers in Anhui Province would assist in suppressing the rebellion and saving the country with the spirit of self-defense and saving the homeland.</p>

<h3>Father Unfatherly, Daughter Undaughterly: Meeting in Court; Elderly Man Accuses Daughter of Abandonment; Cursed as "Little Ghost" in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Li Buying sued his biological daughter, Li Bilian, for abandoning a direct blood relative of the senior generation. The case was heard in the local court yesterday by Judge Xie Zhiying. Li Buying married Li Meihua early in life, and the following year they had a daughter named Bilian. In August of the 12th year of the Republic [1923], the couple disagreed and divorced. Bilian, who was ten years old at the time, left with her mother. Her mother remarried to a man surnamed Dong, and since then there had been no communication. Recently, due to old age, poverty, and illness, Li Buying remembered his biological daughter from whom he had been separated for more than twenty years. After several inquiries, he learned that Bilian had married Tian Yongsheng. He wanted to re-establish the father-daughter relationship and have her responsible for his support. Bilian ignored him, so Li Buying filed a lawsuit in the local court. According to Li Bilian's testimony yesterday: "Thirty years old, from Hangzhou, formerly a prostitute, previously married to Tian Yongsheng, now divorced. There is no father-daughter relationship with Li Buying." Li Buying still wanted to assert his authority as a father, saying to Bilian: "You have to speak properly in court." Bilian cursed: "Strange, why should I let you tell me how to speak, you little ghost." According to Li Buying: "I don't want money, I just want my daughter back, to seek family reunion." After the questioning, the court adjourned the hearing for further trial.</p>

<h3>Rescuing Out-of-School Children, Eliminating Illiteracy: Earnestly Hoping for Wide Response from Readers, Fulfilling the Mission of the Aid-to-Education Movement</h3>
<p>After eight years of arduous and magnificent national resistance, China has leaped from the status of a semi-colonial country to become one of the five major powers. This victorious result was achieved by the flesh and blood of our fellow countrymen. Now that the enemy has been defeated, our motherland should embark on the broad road to prosperity. Every Chinese citizen has a sacred mission to maintain this victorious result. To maintain this result, we must first conduct a strict self-examination and critique. We must frankly and consciously examine everything about ourselves. Are our industries up to the standard of a strong power? Can our culture be classified as strong? We should frankly admit that all our cultural construction is still far from the standard of a strong power!</p>
<p>Among the five major powers, China still has the most illiterates, as well as the most out-of-school youth. Dear readers, every Chinese citizen has a mission to eliminate illiteracy and rescue out-of-school children. If you have spare time, you should voluntarily teach an illiterate person to recognize the writing of the motherland. If you have money, you should donate some to poor young people so that they can continue</p>
<p>For this reason, we launched the "Reader Aid-to-Education Movement" on August 22nd, widely soliciting donations from the community. For the future of the motherland, for the rise and fall of the nation, every Chinese citizen should shoulder this sacred mission, which is: "Rescue out-of-school children, eliminate illiteracy!"</p>

According to this year's profit tax collection system for business operations, there are two types: (1) Account Audit Taxation System, which is to check the accounts and calculate the tax amount to be collected based on the profit amount obtained this year; (2) Standard Tax Calculation System, which is to sample the accounts, calculate the classification of capital turnover rate and classification of net profit rate to determine the tax amount to be taxed. This city was originally a standard tax calculation system, but Shao Zulan, director of the Direct Tax Bureau of this city, and Cheng Xiugang, chief of the business section, used their authority to collect so-called "surtax" when collecting the profit tax for the 35th year of the Republic [1946]. In April of this year, when Shao and Cheng investigated the business situation and exchanged opinions with the various trade associations of this city, they said that the profit tax for this city this year must be collected according to the account audit taxation system, in order to intimidate various merchants, and declared that it must be collected at eight times the total amount collected last year as the standard. As a result of Shao and Cheng's haggling with various trade associations, the regular tax was collected at four times last year, and a "surtax" of 50% to 70% was also required. When collecting the "surtax", no receipts were given, saying that it was collected on behalf of the bureau. Subsequently, the silk, department store, watch, stationery, and rice trade associations of this city, in order to avoid account audits, endured and paid the "surtax" in full. The amount of "surtax" admitted to be paid by each industry is 10 million yuan at most and 5 million yuan at least. With 50 industries in the city, the average is 6 million yuan per industry, then the amount of illegal extortion by Shao and Cheng should be more than 300 million yuan. The illegal behavior of this massive corruption case was reported by Bethlehem and other merchants in this city. Upon receiving the report, the Xuzhou Municipal Council, after many days of investigation, obtained conclusive evidence. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance, the Executive Yuan, and the Supervisory Office in the name of the Municipal Council, all the documents were transferred to the Xuzhou Local Court Prosecutor's Office for reference. After the case occurred, Shao Zulan, in order to silence the witness, quickly transferred Cheng Xiugang, the business section chief who had collected the money, out of Xuzhou. Later, Wang Songling, supervisor of the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau, came to Xuzhou under orders to investigate. After Wang returned to the District Bureau, he telegraphed the Xuzhou Municipal Council: "Chief Cheng Xiugang of the Bureau does have suspicions of malfeasance." He lightly shifted the massive corruption case of Shao Zulan to Cheng alone, which made local people very angry. Fortunately, the case has been prosecuted by the Local Court Prosecutor's Office, and all parties are now quietly watching how the state will punish the scene of corruption.

<h3>Zibo Mining Area Survey: "House of Struggle"</h3>
<p>[Our Zichuan Dispatch on the 6th] Recently, the communist bandits have dug the trenches of class struggle deeper and wider. From "land struggle" of "returning land to the home" to "property struggle" of "sweeping out the door," and recently progressing from "sweeping out the door" to "bloody struggle" of "stones stewed with meat," the blood feuds of the human world have become increasingly fierce!</p>
<p>During my visit to Zibo this time, I interviewed several "houses of struggle." One of them was the family of a colleague, Mr. Cheng Baihua, a current reporter for the Jinan Zheng Bao newspaper. He lived at No. 23, Houjie Street, Taiwei Temple. His father operated a Zhenye coal mine with a daily output of over one hundred tons of coal. During the period when the communist bandits occupied Chuanshan, his</p>
<p>entire family fled</p>
<p>to Jinan. When the bandits launched the struggle, they had no choice but to write his father's name on a piece of paper to represent him. Then, they gathered the people to hold a struggle meeting, during which all the furniture in his house and the equipment in the mine were completely struggled away. Another family was that of Zhang Huanzhen, a highly respected and impartial gentleman widely recognized in Boshan. Whenever people in Boshan had any difficult disputes that could not be resolved, they would be resolved by him and everyone would be convinced. Zhang is now seventy-eight years old, a former Qing Dynasty Jinshi (successful candidate in the imperial examination) who served as a magistrate and was the president of the Chamber of Commerce in this county for ten years. His son, Lianxi, is fifty-nine years old. He has six grandchildren, five of whom are in Qingdao. It is said that his family also runs a bank there. The whole family totals eighty-two people, with over thirty mu of land and two large buildings. His distant cousin, Zhang Jingtao, serves as a political commissar in the communist bandits. During the period when the bandits occupied Boshan, Zhang called him and reprimanded him. Six days before the Eighth Route Army prepared to abandon Boshan for the third time (August 11th), the gate of his house was first sealed and locked by the "Boshan Avenue Town Joint Post-War Committee" of the communist bandits. Subsequently, he and his family were forced to participate in a struggle meeting presided over by Liu Zhengxiang, the "Chairman of the Turn-Over Committee" of the communist bandits. This was what the communist bandits called "locking the door to hold a meeting." In a meeting actually controlled by village cadres, his crime was determined to be "old feudal, old die-hard, killing people with hidden knives without seeing blood," a "Jiang root." Today, they were going to "uproot the Jiang root" and said that the five mu of land he returned to Qiugu after the victory over the Japanese occupation during the war was encroached upon the people, and that he had forcibly occupied more than thirty mu, so he had to be struggled and turned over. Then, it was passed that all the furniture and sundries in his house were struggled as clean as sweeping the floor. This new term added by the communist bandits is what they call</p>
<p>Swept out the door</p>
<p>. After the struggle meeting ended, Zhang and his grandson were detained in Baoen Temple. On the 12th and 13th, they were paraded through the streets, with a paper hat more than three feet high on his head, inscribed "Former Qing Dynasty Jinshi, Republic of China Magistrate, Kuomintang Councilor Zhang Huanzhen." When some people saw his old age during the parade and asked to allow him to sit down for a while, they were ordered not to. On the same day, two "feudalists," Cui and Zhao, who were also paraded through the streets, were stoned to death, which the communist bandits called "stones stewed with meat." On the 14th, Zhang was first stoned and was in so much pain that he almost died several times. His grandson could not bear to witness it and asked to join the Eighth Route Army to redeem his grandfather's life, but it was not allowed. He asked to die in his place, but it was also not allowed. In the morning, Zhang was finally plunged into the misery of</p>
<p>Stones Stewed with Meat</p>
<p>and died. Before Zhang died, he told his son, "Don't learn from me in the future. I have never done anything against my conscience in my life, but in the end, I ended up like this!"</p>
<p>After Zhang died, when his family collected his body, they planned to put it in a good coffin, but the bandits did not allow it. Until now, it is still placed in a thin wooden coffin in Wujialing! When the reporter asked his grandson why the communist bandits did not harm him but only asked him to accompany him in the parade, he told me, "This is what the communist bandits call carrying the Jiang seedling! The purpose is to show me, to let me know how powerful they are!"</p>
<p>Zhang's house is on Xiguan Street, one with three courtyards and one with a large quadrangle courtyard. When the reporter visited, they had returned home because the National Army had arrived. However, because the</p>
<p>Furniture and Sundries</p>
<p>had been struggled away, only an empty shell remained. Many people in the family still slept on the floor. Director Fan Qijun, who was sent by Chairman Wang to offer comfort, promised them that as long as they could recognize their original items, they could ask County Magistrate Liang Ru to recover them.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Director Wang Yanqing of the News Office of Hu Yingyuan's department, when their troops entered Wangcun on August 16th, he witnessed several pieces of</p>
<p>Large Stone Slabs</p>
<p>on the side of the road in the river valley, under which twelve people were pressed. Eleven of them had been crushed to death. One person, named Fu Tang, was known to have been struggled by the bandits after the National Army lifted the bluestone from his body. First, they used stones, wooden sticks, or knives and axes to smash or beat them to the point of near death, and then they pressed them under huge stones for the public to watch. Director Sang of the Boshan Youth League told me that three or four li outside Boshan City, the local Eighth Route Army is still carrying out widespread and fierce struggles. In Yuanquan (fifty li southeast of Boshan) alone, as many as forty-nine people suffered the torture of "stones stewed with meat" in one day. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)</p>
<h3>Zichuan Large Trunks Waiting for Original Owners to Claim</h3>
<p>[Our Zichuan Dispatch on the 6th] The "struggle" in Zichuan is even more intense than in Boshan. According to a preliminary investigation by the county government, over 18,000 households in Zichuan were struggled, over 1,700 people were struggled to death, and over 6,300 people were taken away by the bandits. In the urban area, over 370 families were struggled. Over 50 commercial shops and over 20 hotels and sauce gardens that originally existed last year were all struggled away. Most of the over 10 coal and porcelain industries were also struggled. The largest Fengyong Sauce Garden in the city had over 200,000 jin of wild vegetables, which were also struggled away this time. Each person in the urban area was given an average of 70 jin. In the Zichuan County Government, there are still large numbers of trunks struggled by the bandits, filling several rooms, waiting for the original owners to come and claim them.</p>
<p>The communist bandits' endless "struggle" includes "rich peasants," "middle peasants," and even self-cultivating farmers with about ten mu of land. In Shilipu, outside Zichuan City, with a total of seventy-five households, five families have been struggled by the communist village cadres. The families of Councilor Geng Zhanyuan and his brother were both struggled. The communist bandits still did not think this was enough. Their village cadres held a meeting and decided to struggle forty families. The people knew this, and they could not bear it any longer, so they joined forces to tie up three village cadres and send them to the communist public district. As a result, the bandits replaced the three cadres, and the decision was dropped. On September 1st, five more people were abducted by the communist bandits. Therefore, after the reporter visited farmers in various parts of central Shandong, their unanimous conclusion was: The so-called "struggle" and the so-called "turn over" means the rich become poor, and the poor become poorer. The more you struggle, the poorer you become, and the more you turn over, the deeper you sink!</p>

<h3>Zou Lu Writes to Hu Shi to Discuss University Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Fu Wei Zou Lu recently sent an open letter to Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, to discuss Hu's proposal that the government should stipulate the first five-year plan to fully assist the development of five universities. The original letter is as follows: "Mr. Shizhi has said: I recently read in the newspaper that you have published your opinions on the ten-year plan for education in our country. Your ability to achieve academic independence, your far-sightedness, your long heart, and your heavy words are admired. However, you propose that the government should stipulate the first five-year plan to fully assist the development of five universities, namely Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Wuhan University, and Sun Yat-sen University, restricting them to become the best universities in the country and have a place in the world. I don't know if the Sun Yat-sen University you are referring to is Nanjing Central University or Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University. If it refers to Nanjing Central University, then there are Tsinghua University and Peking University in the north of our country, and Central University, Zhejiang University, and Wuhan University in the middle, while the south is completely lacking, which should not be so biased; if it refers to Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University, then the capital city has no good university, which is also inappropriate. I think you must have other brilliant insights on this point, and I hope you will clarify it. There are more than one person who shares the above sentiments. I am specially writing this to send my best regards, Zou Lu, September 11th."</p>

N rosin rose by 20,000 yuan per can. Stearin sales were strong, rising by 700,000 yuan to 7.2 million yuan per dan. However, vanilla oil fell back by 3,000 yuan per pound, while white wax remained stable.</p>
<h3>Authorities Plan to Abolish Northeast Soybean Controls</h3>
<p>[Our Benxi Dispatch on the 11th] Previously, Northeast soybeans were subject to controls, which led to stagnation in purchasing and transportation, plunging the Northeast economy into a crisis, this is one reason. Economic authorities are now planning to allow free trade and export of soybeans, and will soon announce its implementation, as soybeans occupy an important position in Northeast exports.</p>
<p>In the past, one jin of soybeans could be exchanged for 1.4 jin of gaoliang (sorghum), but now two jin of soybeans are required for one jin of gaoliang. Soybeans are valued at 19,000 yuan per 100 jin in circulation notes, while gaoliang is valued at 24,000 yuan, causing considerable hardship for farmers.</p>
<h3>National Income Research Association Holds Preparatory Meeting in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China National Income Joint Research Committee, initiated by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, held a preparatory meeting in Nanjing on the 11th of this month, passing the organizational regulations. The committee will establish a technical group, composed of experts from each participating unit, and will also hire other domestic and foreign experts. At the time, Ji Chaoding and Zhao Zhangcheng were elected as conveners of the committee, and Wu Dousan and Sun Gongdu were elected as conveners of the technical group. Work will commence as soon as the experts for the technical group are appointed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Negotiated Price Increases Again: 20-count Yarn at 11.8 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The negotiated price for cotton yarn at the Textile Adjustment Conference increased again yesterday. The price for 20-count yarn was raised to 11.8 million yuan, an increase of 400,000 yuan from the previous price. The prices for other counts of yarn will be proportionally increased accordingly.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Flat and Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was generally flat and weak at the opening due to news that the authorities would strictly enforce yarn and cloth management and that credit was tightening. Subsequently, prices varied due to differing positions among market participants. Although the negotiated price at the Textile Adjustment Conference was raised again, demand was not as strong as the previous day. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day, while other 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, 6-count, 42-count, 40-count, and 32-count yarns of various brands experienced fluctuations of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was weak due to the large amount of national bank transfers and the tightening of credit. However, because actual sales were still brisk, Hankou dealers continued to purchase Yuan Bijii cloth, pushing the price from 580,000 yuan to 900,000 yuan. Longtou fine cloth fell slightly by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 522,000 yuan. Other cloths remained stable.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn in two groups, A and B, as usual yesterday. Group A offered 16 types of yarn in various counts, selling a total of 1,627 pieces, with 377 applications. Group B offered 12 types of yarn in various counts, selling a total of 2,129 pieces, with 1,418 applications. In total, 3,756 pieces of yarn were sold, equivalent to 5,766 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 1,795 applications.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was slightly weaker than the previous day because cotton yarn sales were not strong, yarn prices were flat and weak, and yarn mills' enthusiasm had waned. Traders shifted from buying to selling due to tighter credit. Subsequently, trading became slightly more active as retail investors covered short positions. Total transactions were 1,220 bales. Prices for delivery to factories were: N.T. 2.68 million yuan, 100 bales traded; warehouse delivery prices were Lingbin 2.55 million yuan, 2.58 million yuan to 2.6 million yuan, 260 bales traded; Hankou fine lint 2.38 million yuan to 2.43 million yuan, 540 bales traded; Shandong wooden frame 2.25 million yuan, 50 bales traded; Guide 2.37 million yuan, 75 bales traded; Huoji 2 million yuan to 2.05 million yuan, 200 bales traded; Zhoupu cottonseed 385,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Active Domestic Tea Market</h3>
<p>Since the domestic red and green tea market has seen continuous sales from this street and guest merchants, the market yesterday remained active due to sustained buying interest. Prices also remained firm, as holders were unwilling to lower their prices. The outlook is predicted to be upward, with no decline. The foreign tea market, however, remained weak and lacking activity, with declining transactions and a quiet and stable situation. The Anhui Tea Company recently displayed samples of dozens of this year's Qimen black teas. Currently, companies such as Wang Yutai Hua Tea are inspecting them for selection.</p>
<h3>Eleven Associations, Including Rubber, Push for Representatives to Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Eleven industrial associations in this city, including rubber, paper, wool spinning, cement, leather making, and silk weaving, have been in contact with the Import and Export Management Committee and the Central Bank regarding the issue of converting foreign exchange for the imported goods that were granted quotas in the first and second quarters at the official exchange rate. This has been going on for three weeks, but no solution has been reached. These industries believe that: (1) raw material inventories in the factories are dwindling, (2) foreign exporters are increasingly pressing for payment and may cancel orders, (3) the black market exchange rate is rising sharply, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. At a meeting held recently, it was decided to send Hong Nianzu, Yang Liren, Zhang Shanzhang, and Xi Zhengxiu as representatives to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, hoping to obtain a solution as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties faced by these industries.</p>

<h3>External Injuries Can Worsen Existing Illnesses</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>When I was young, I enjoyed reading novels, and whenever I read about someone "becoming bedridden and dying after suffering an injury, lingering for months," I always thought it was an exaggeration. I never believed that such a thing could actually happen, because according to common sense, a serious injury could be fatal within a few days; and a minor injury, after a period of recuperation, would naturally heal completely. I certainly didn't believe that an injury could lead to death months later. As for the rumors about martial arts techniques that claimed that "an enemy who has been struck with a certain acupressure technique could die months or half a year later," I thought these were even more mysterious and unbelievable.</p>
<p>Later, when I studied medicine, I did not change this belief. However, since practicing medicine in Shanghai, I have seen and heard many things that have truly moved me, and all my previous beliefs have gradually been shaken by unexpected miracles. The following is an example of the type of incident I am referring to in this article:</p>
<p>"A fifty-three-year-old man, who had always been strong and well-nourished, had family members who suffered from tuberculosis, but he himself had never had any record of illness.</p>
<p>At lunchtime on November 26th of last year (at which time he was completely healthy and working), he accidentally tripped over a barbed wire hidden in the snow while walking quickly. His right foot got caught in the wire, and he immediately fell forward, striking his chest heavily on the hard ground. His right chest was hit particularly hard. It seemed that his lungs were also affected, but he soon recovered and did not feel any pain. After returning home, he did not feel any pain, but occasionally experienced chest pain and tightness in the evening.</p>
<p>The next day, he felt slightly unwell, so he rested at home for the day.</p>
<p>Eight days after the injury (on December 4th), he felt that he had completely recovered, so he went to a public bathhouse. On December 6th, he was riding on a streetcar when he suddenly vomited blood several times and returned home immediately. On December 8th, he went to the hospital for treatment. At this time, an X-ray examination of his lungs revealed calcified lesions in both lungs and the lower lobe of the right lung. There were also calcified lesions near both lung hilums. These symptoms could of course be considered to be a combination of hardened early-stage tuberculosis lesions (Toc. Primaercomlpex). Both of his lungs had Simon's tuberculosis lesions. The blood sedimentation rate was 10/20mm. The results of a complete blood test were completely normal. From December 7th to 9th, he had a slight fever, but it soon subsided. Subsequently, on December 19th and 20th, he had a high fever of 38.6 degrees, but after treatment, it subsided completely. After that, he was without fever for seven days. However, from December 31st to January 10th of this year, he developed a fever again.</p>
<p>On January 11th of this year (46 days after the injury), he suddenly developed a high fever accompanied by numerous chills. At this time, a clinical examination led to a diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis (the most malignant form of tuberculosis). The results of his X-ray examination are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) December 8th (12 days after the injury): Both lungs were clear and free of disease. Both lower lung angles were normal. The diaphragm had slight curves. The shadows of both lung hilums were enlarged, and the right lung hilum had old calcified spots, forming a small cluster. This was of course a combination of early-stage old tuberculosis. And the old lesions of its early erosion could also be clearly identified at the bifurcation of the trachea. There were also a few calcified tuberculosis lesions in the left lung hilum. A few of these lesions were located near the upper left chamber of the heart shadow. (To be continued)"</p>
<h3>Japanese Schistosomiasis, Popular in Southern Jiangsu (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Shen Luo</p>
<p>The second stage, from larva to adult worm, until the liver and spleen enlarge. At this time, the patient's stool contains blood and mucus, similar to dysentery. Initially, there is tenesmus and urgency, with more than ten bowel movements per day. The worm eggs can be found in the stool under a microscope. Bleeding occurs in the mucous membranes of the intestines, nose, gums, and uterus. There are also irregular menstruation, anemia, weight loss, emaciation, weakness, palpitations, difficulty breathing, excessive saliva secretion, thirst, stomach pain, heartburn, noisy stomach, vomiting blood, belching, and a feeling of stagnation and pressure in the stomach. The liver and spleen are enlarged, the temperature increases in the afternoon, and the destruction caused by the adult worms in the body intensifies day by day.</p>
<p>In the third stage, if left untreated for several years, the liver and spleen become cirrhotic and atrophied, with tenderness and an uneven surface. There is congestion of the portal vein. At this time, the disease becomes serious, causing a vicious cycle of dysfunction, fluid accumulation in the abdomen (distension), reduced urine output, nutritional disorders, severe anemia, swelling of the lower extremities, night blindness, and visual deterioration. The number of eosinophilic leukocytes in the blood increases. The globulin protein precipitation test is positive, and the knee reflexes are exaggerated. Eventually, the patient dies of exhaustion.</p>
<p>This disease can also be classified into acute and chronic types based on the severity of the symptoms. The acute type can be cured in a few weeks or two to three months, but it is prone to recurrence. The chronic type can last for two to three years, or even ten to twenty or thirty years, eventually leading to systemic weakness and death. The "big belly disease" and "bloating disease" commonly referred to in the rural areas of southern Jiangsu are this type of schistosomiasis.</p>
<p>E. Prevention and Treatment: Prevention is more important than treatment. Early treatment has a good chance of recovery. If the liver and spleen are severely damaged, or even if the heart and brain are affected, it is difficult to save. The most effective drugs for schistosomiasis in the past were trivalent antimony preparations, such as antimony potassium tartrate (Stiblc-Kali Tartaricum) or Fuadin, Stibosan, Neo-Stibosan, administered intravenously or intramuscularly, once every other day, for a total of twelve injections. Do not exceed the dose to avoid poisoning. However, these are rarely used by physicians recently.</p>
<p>Antimony potassium tartrate is the most effective drug for treating this disease. After treatment, the worm eggs can no longer be found in the stool in about 85% of patients. However, it is somewhat toxic, and side effects such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and cough often occur after injection. Fuadin, produced by Bayer, is administered intramuscularly, initially at 1.5 cc, followed by 3 to 5 cc, once every other day, until a total dose of 40 cc is reached. The advantage is that the reaction is milder, but the efficacy is lower and recurrence is more frequent. Moreover, the current market price is very high, about 300,000 yuan per box of ten injections. According to a clinical report from the Southern Jiangsu Local Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute of Jiangsu Province on the application of Fuadin, among 24 patients who completed treatment with this drug, 13 (54.2%) had no worm eggs in their stool after re-examination, 8 (33.3%) had reduced symptoms, and 3 (12.5%) died of severe illness. (See Volume 1, Issue 1 of "Southern Jiangsu Prevention and Treatment Monthly," compiled by the author and published on July 1, 1947).</p>
<p>The United States also produces Fuadin injections. The Shanghai Shinyi Pharmaceutical Factory has recently produced "Solu-Stisin," a pentavalent antimony preparation (which is more advanced than trivalent antimony), which has therapeutic value for schistosomiasis and kala-azar?</p>
<p>In addition, the use of quinine, iron preparations, arsenic acid (Acid. Avsenisosum), etc., for nutritional therapy, as well as the administration of laxatives, is also important. It is even better if the patient can move to another place for recuperation.</p>
<p>The key points of prevention are to actively prevent this disease and fundamentally eliminate Japanese schistosomiasis and its intermediate host (Oncomelania hupensis snails), such as spreading lime or copper sulfate solution in the riverbank to kill the snails, deepening the riverbed where the snails are found, and increasing the slope of the river beach to prevent the snails from breeding, etc. However, these measures are extremely costly, and given the current economic situation in rural China, they cannot be universally implemented.</p>
<p>The passive measures rely on the popularization of health education, strengthening prevention and control propaganda, and improving environmental hygiene. In schistosomiasis-prone areas, there are two points that are particularly important:</p>
<p>First, regarding public aspects—strictly implement fecal management and closely manage patients, because the feces of patients with schistosomiasis often contain worm eggs, which are the medium for transmitting schistosomiasis, spreading the disease to others. Therefore, we must achieve the following two points (which, of course, require political force to promote):</p>
<p>1. Strictly prohibit washing toilet bowls in rivers.</p>
<p>2. When using feces for fertilization, never use fresh feces; stale feces should be used, and should be left for at least ten days (at least one month in winter) to allow the feces to ferment and kill the larvae and eggs for safety.</p>
<p>Second, regarding individual aspects:</p>
<p>1. Do not swim or wash in rivers or ponds that contain Oncomelania hupensis snails.</p>
<p>2. Boil drinking water and food.</p>
<p>3. When farming, fishing, or draining water, wear long rubber boots or oilcloth boots and thin cloth socks to protect your legs and feet from invasion by schistosomiasis cercariae.</p>
<p>G. Recent Prevalence in Wu County: The Southern Jiangsu Local Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute of Jiangsu Province is the competent authority for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, directly under the Jiangsu Provincial Health Department. The current director, Dr. Chuan Guang, has extensive experience in the prevention and treatment of this disease. According to an investigation report, stool samples were collected and widely examined in more than 20 townships in Wu County, including Mu Mai, and schistosomiasis eggs were found in all of them. The infection rate ranged from 0.9% to 29.4%, with Xu Kou Township being the highest. In addition, the institute collected Oncomelania hupensis snails from various townships in Wu County for examination to provide supporting evidence. Schistosomiasis cercariae were found in 0.3% to 23.7% of the snails, also with Xu Kou Township being the highest. In addition, a recent survey of seven primary and secondary schools in Suzhou City examined 317 people and found schistosomiasis eggs in 6 people, or 1.9%. A survey of 5,322 snails collected from five rivers and lakes outside Panmen, Loumen, Fengmen, Guanmen, and Xumen found 348 cercariae, or 6.5%. This is just one example from the survey, and the extent of the epidemic in the vast rural areas can be imagined! (Author's note: Due to space limitations, the details of the above survey are detailed in my "Southern Jiangsu Prevention and Treatment Monthly," and will be reported in another article later to inform readers).</p>
<h3>My Views on the So-Called "Thirst and Polyuria Disease"</h3>
<p>— Tsuchikichi Makoto</p>
<p>Recently, I read Dr. Wang Zhirong's article "Random Talk on Thirst and Polyuria Disease in Children" in this publication, and I deeply admire his spirit of research during his spare time. Dr. Wang also requested fellow doctors and patients to provide relevant information, so I will present two cases based on what I have heard, seen, and personally experienced, to serve as reference.</p>
<p>The pathology of the so-called "thirst and polyuria disease" still needs to be further explored. However, according to Dr. Mitsutoku Karasawa, Professor of Pediatrics at Keio University in Japan, regarding similar diseases, it is believed that the thermoregulatory center of infants and young children has not yet fully developed, causing their body temperature to increase proportionally with the increase in air temperature. This is not only true in summer, but also at other times of the year. If you try using three or four hot water bottles, wrapped in a quilt, and place this type of infant in it, you may find a high fever of 38, 39, or even 40 degrees. If you remove the hot water bottles or reduce the clothing at this time, the body temperature can drop rapidly. Therefore, during the hot summer months, infants often have a persistent fever of unknown cause, reaching 37.5 degrees to 39 degrees or higher, without any other symptoms. As soon as the outside air cools down, the body temperature naturally returns to normal. If the child is bathed when the fever rises, the body temperature can be reduced. These cases can all be regarded as cases of fever due to incomplete function of the thermoregulatory center (Stauungs fteber). Other scholars also call this disease summer fever, although the names are different, their clinical observations and theories are generally the same.</p>
<p>Based on my personal diagnosis and treatment experience, I encounter many such children every summer. The younger the child, the higher the fever, with body temperatures sometimes reaching 39 degrees or 40 degrees or higher. However, all examinations reveal no particular abnormalities. As the weather cools down, the fever also subsides. When the same patient relapses the following year, the fever is milder and the duration is shorter. If it relapses in the third year, the fever is even milder and the duration is even shorter. Although there are occasional complications with other diseases, they heal quickly with treatment. However, the fever does not subside until the weather cools down. As for the infectious theory mentioned by Dr. Wang in his article, I have not yet found any evidence to support it. I have also not seen diarrhea as a necessary symptom. The treatment method, in addition to having the patient rest, emphasizes nutrition first. In terms of medication, I give Vitamin B and heart tonics to those with higher and longer-lasting fevers, and the results have all been good, with no adverse outcomes seen.</p>
<p>There was another case where I diagnosed it as this disease and then referred it to another doctor, who diagnosed it as indigestion or typhoid fever, thereby reducing the child's nutrition. As a result, the fever became even higher, and the patient came back for treatment. I used the same method as before, and the fever became lighter again. More than a month later, the weather became cool and comfortable, and the body temperature returned to normal. From this, it can be seen that since there is currently no specific treatment for this disease, increasing nutrition is certainly necessary. As for moving to another place for recuperation or living in a room with air conditioning, it should be effective, but few families' economic conditions are suitable.</p>
<h3>A Telegram from the Shanghai Medical Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association, feeling indignant about the Nanjing District Court judge's disregard for forensic medicine and medical institutions, and the lack of solid evidence to refute the testimony and physical evidence, arbitrarily sentenced Dr. Qian Mingxi of the Nanjing Municipal Hospital to imprisonment, sent a telegram requesting the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Justice Administration, the Ministry of Health, the Supreme Court, the Capital High Court, the National Medical Association Federation, and medical associations in various regions to uphold justice. The original telegram is reproduced below: To the Honorable Courts, Ministries, and Associations: After reading the newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai and receiving letters and telegrams from medical organizations in various places, we are all extremely indignant at the Nanjing District Court judge's disregard for forensic medicine and medical institutions, and the lack of solid evidence to refute the testimony and physical evidence, arbitrarily sentenced Dr. Qian Mingxi of the Nanjing Municipal Hospital to one year and six months in prison for manslaughter. We believe that this will leave medical professionals without legal protection in the future, endanger patients, cause doctors to become reluctant to act, hinder scientific construction, endanger national health, and bring ridicule to the international medical community. The members of this association are panicked and feel insecure. We earnestly request that you (Court, Ministry, Association) uphold justice, safeguard the nascent field of medicine, and are extremely concerned. Shanghai Medical Association Chairman Yu Ling and two thousand members respectfully request this.</p>
