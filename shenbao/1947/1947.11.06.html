<h3>美國務院正式宣布　救濟糧食月杪運華　錢江塘工局獲美救濟款</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕國務院本日宣布：依照一九四七年十月廿七日中美兩國所簽定之救濟協定條件，在美國對外救濟計劃下，已規定以二千七百七十萬美元，作爲購買及運送中國所急需之救濟物資。目前所定之計劃，規定供給由美國所分派之小麥五萬長噸與白米四萬三千長噸，以及由邊羅方面分派之白米近三萬長噸。計劃中其餘部份大半醫藥供應品。採購小麥與白米之事宜，已在美國進行，預料在十一月底前後，即可開始裝運。在暹羅採購白米一事，將由美國物資貸款公司委託其駐船谷之代理人代國務院辦理之。中國對於穀類之需要，爲數甚大，在上項計劃下，恐無法應付中國全部之而要。因此，爲最高限度之效能着想，一般計劃將美國之穀類物資，主要在沿海各城市發放。如此，種植穀類之鄉村區，可不必將其當地所產之物資大批運往都市中心，而改爲應付本鄉之急切需要。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕美國務院官員稱，關於中美協定救濟物資之處理，渠等尚未決定中國沿海何城市將立即獲得美國之救濟。但據悉：上海將包括於所準備之名單內。渠等又稱：「在此項計劃下所運入中國之醫藥救濟品，將大部分限於現製治療品之範圍內，如磺頗類藥品及靑徵素（盤尼西林）等，而非中國所已能製造供給之各種防疫苗」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕美對華救濟物資，官方雖未規定中共不得接受分配，但因大半擬運往中國沿岸城市，顯將專供國府之川。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州五日電〕錢江海塘工程局將獲得二百五十萬美金救濟款，此係由美國政府中華救濟幽，依照中美救濟協定而給予。按，該救濟團秘書邵桓，今特來杭探詢塘工局方面之需要。依照塘工局訂定之五年計劃，須達成修復坍毀石塘三千三百公尺，完成通航及擴地四十萬畝，需費約需六五〇萬美金，經洽定撥予二五〇萬美美金，並由該團決定，以一百萬作通航費用，一百五十萬修復坍毀石塘。至撥款之技術問題，將於明後日由秘書與聯總駐塘工局梅工程師商洽，聞除少量油料外，餘均係現款。</p>
<h3>我國現有存美資金　約三億四千萬美元　世界糧食會議所作報告</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電」四日開始舉行首次會議之世界糧食會議，已由十八國代表準備一項研究報告，該報告指出，中國可立即動用之基金，爲數祗達八千七百萬美元，另加上其他官方所有之黃金美元及美元證券，爲數不過三億四千萬美元之資金。該報告指出，中國每月短缺三四百萬美元之數。包括多數國家在內之該項硏究報告，係由聯合國糧食農業組織之屬員所準備者，其對各國金元地位之估計，係迄於十一月一日爲止。而其估計之根據，則係視一國對另一國之實際貿易平衡，或一國對美國之貿易，或一國對某特殊數國之個別差額償付而定者。該報告特別指出，中國可供償付一切進口之現有基金，祗敷三個月之用，而他項可得之基金，亦不過足數十個月之用。該報告估計中國每月食糧進口爲二百萬美元，以現有基金償付，可應四十二個月之用，而其他基金，則亦僅可供一百七十個</p>
<h3>周以德過日返美　在東京談話論日本安全　美報讚譽范登堡呼籲援華言論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美議員周以德來華搜集資料竣事，已於昨晨九時搭西北航空公司班機取通柬京返美。周氏在華勾留逾句，與我國公私方面，均多接觸。其在滬約晤之人士，全由美總領館代爲介紹，姓名嚴守秘密，惟悉除美商領袖及中國金融家外，敎會及醫界人士亦不少，因周氏本人對此深感興趣也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京五日電〕美國衆議員周以德自華返美，今日途經此間，稍作勾留，並發表談話稱：「日本安全如受蘇聯威脅，即無機會變成獨立民主國。吾人應使日本有成爲獨立自給之民主國。此爲美國人民所欲者」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約五日電〕霍華特系報社評，盛譽范登堡之見解，即世界問題，不應分劃處理，祗管援歐而不考慮援華。該報稱：「我人已一再提醒政府當局，逃避發表援英之計劃，實爲短視，且可能反阻碍彼等保衛中之馬歇爾計劃。顯然，國會將要求杜魯門與馬歇爾在盟邦中國未被紅色侵略完全毀滅前，確定積極之政策。」</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約五日電〕紐約先鋒論壞罷評論中國局勢，文中稱：「政府軍之軍刀雖勝於中共，但結果仍未能打得一次勝仗，其主要之原因，乃該政府在大多數區械中，不受人歡迎之故。政府在東北遭過敗續，其原因不在共黨力量之離厚，而在東北人民認爲殊無由對南京政府表示熱誠。然此一事實並非謂中國已無脫去共黨獨裁制度之希望，亦非謂現政府內一切皆惡。在政府中居高位者，亦有若干在各方面均屬第一流而誠實無疑之人。如能將政府中之貪官汚吏一律繫之於獄，而使賢能與誠實之人獲有更多之權力，則共黨在中國之威脅，即不致有如目下之嚴重」。</p>
<h3>胡適論美援華　謂蒲立特態度嚴正</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕前駐美大使胡適，頃在平發表重要評論，提醒美國貸款援華應勿傷中國國家民族尊嚴，並反對麥克阿瑟顧問中國事務，最後並建議由美國信任之陳光甫主持貸款的管理和支配，以代替其他保證。胡氏稱：「蒲立特認爲中國是應該而且値得帮助，態度可謂極其嚴正，至於他提出的貸款數目是否够用，尚待專家硏究」。</p>
<h3>全國司法行政　檢討囘議揭幕　何崇善宣讀主席訓詞</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕全國司法行政檢討會議，五日晨九時假司法行政部禮堂幕，出席會員及長官來賓等百餘人，開會前，首由張羣院長致詞，略謂：渠十餘年從政於中央地方，向以「崇法務實」與同僚互勉。今國家已步上民主之途，法治不可或缺，政府之職掌即在於行法執法，而舉國法治精神之培養，端　司法同人之努力。領事裁判權取消徒，吾人對外法律上已完全平等，然實際上我國司法實仍落後，各級法院之組織，設備，以及監獄之管理等均不如人，需加以檢討，力求改進。張氏盛議司法人員之刻苦廉直，頻寄語聲勉並祝會議成功。張氏致詞後即離會，趕往參加中政會。</p>
<h3>謝冠生開幕詞　鼓勵服務精神</h3>
<p>撿討會乃由謝冠生部長主席如儀開會並致開幕辭，首對與會各地高院首長致安慰勉及歡迎之意，並爲戰時忠勇殉職之法界人員默致哀敬。繼關述會議之目的在集從事司法實務及硏究理論之專家於一堂，共伺檢討司法工作過去得失與將來應行興革事宜，本理想事實兼顧原則，硏討決定切實易行之計劃，此爲第二次全國性有關司法之會議，第一次爲民國廿四年秋舉行之全國司法會議，當時宣言中所列五項目標，歷十二年努力已大致有成就：　司法純費之獨立，自三十年起全由國庫負担，預算年有比例增加，　法規研究機關之創設，司法院法規研委會已於上次會後成立，　法院組織之健全，十年來增設法院四百餘，縣司法處六百餘，　法律敎育之改進，全國各大學幾均有法律系，學生名額限制亦早取消，　領事裁判權之撤廢，三十二年起迄今，逐漸廢除無餘，渠認爲此等收穫距理想尙遠，且因時世變遷，戰亂破壞，新缺點亦有發現。此次會議應就審判，檢察，行政，監獄諸端集思廣益，共謀增進效率，彌補缺失，奮發前進。最後渠强調服務精神之鼓勵，勉同人注意以革命之精神，廉潔之操守，研究之興趣及勤勞之習慣四事。謝氏致詞後，由會議何崇善秘書長宣讀蔣主席訓詞（見右下角）。</p>
<h3>居正及許世英　呼籲法官加俸</h3>
<p>旋居正，王雲五，江庸，許世英，樓桐孫，張知本，夏勤等相繼致詞，均一致强調司法事業之重要，並各有建議。居正，許世英皆爲司法人員地位待遇呼籲，許氏並主司法當局制定明歲預算時，應使司法官薪俸高出行政官薪俸，渠將儘力支持，蓋無法保障其本身生活者，何可盡心保障全國人權及生命財產之安全。王雲五建議注意監獄作業，一則節省國帑，二則可使囚犯有生活技能，俾得自新。江庸籲請司法人員自動齊一步伐，不畏强禦，並主張擴大高院及高檢處權限，注意考核，健全制度，增進效率。樓桐孫代表立院孫院長，請司法同人隨時以動勇精神留意所遇立法陣碍，協助立法機關制定通過適用之法律。最後由出席會員司法行政部顧問朱獻文致答詞，十二時始散會，午間由謝部長歡宴全體會員。</p>

<p>下午二時開第一次大會，出席會員一零五人，謝冠生主席，首決定將提案五五二件分由　制度，　法律，　人事會計統計，　監獄及其他等四組審查，繼請龐德顧間講演「現代司法問題」，由法部刑事司司長楊兆龍翻譯，然以時間所限，僅及全題大半。旋由首都，四川，遼寗，吉林四高元長作工作報告，下午六時散會</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕蔣主席對司法行政檢討會議所頒之訓詞原文如下：實施憲政，首重法治，而法治之推行，當以司法爲中心。値茲新憲法行將施行之際，集合全國高級司法行政人員於一堂，檢討過去，策劃將來，謀司法之興革，實爲必要之圖。我國過去遭受列强領事裁判權之束縛，致司法權么行使，障碍叢生，國家主權之被侵，此爲厲階。民國二十二年以後，法權幸已次第收回，我政府多年之收回法權運動卒告成功，此在司法上實具有特殊之意義而至堪欣慰者。惟於此亦應有所反省者，即過去法權之所以遲遲不能收回，列强恒藉口我國司法制度與監獄制度之不良。姑不論其批評是否正確，而在法權旣已完全收回之今日，吾人必須下最大之決心，與最善之努力，謀司法之澈底改革，以期對內適應建國之需要，對外刷新國際之視聽。吾國以三民主義立國，三民主義之實行則必依於法律，法律之執行則必依於司法，故司法實爲推行法治與實行主義之首要部門，吾人亦可謂國民革命之目的，即在建設三民主養之法治國家，法治國家之建設，必須具備三個基本條件：第一，須有元美之法律。自國府成立以來，各種有關司法之法規已次第頒行，燦然大備，然是否盡合國情與社會需要，施行之後有無扞格難行之處。司法人員應本其尃門學術與實際經驗，研究其利弊得失，提出具體意見，以供立法之參考，使立法與司法之精神相貫通，而收推行盡利之效。第二，須有健全之執法人員。有治法無治人，則雖有良法美意，亦必不能見諸實行，故孟子云：「徒法不能以自行」。司法人員負有執行國家法律之權責，必須審愼廉明，本於大公，出於至誠，傎正爲人民解除痛苦，減輕訟累，聽訟拆獄，尤必須入情入理，而兼合於法律之規定，即情理法三者兼顧。須知三民主義最高之理想，即爲情理法之調和，民族主養本乎情，民權主義本乎法，民生主義本乎理，必三者相互調和乃能造成美滿理想之社會。明乎此，而後適用法律，乃能求得最公正之裁判。第三，要有守法之國民。我國過去因受不平等條約之束縛，致國家法紀與社會秩序均遭莫大之破壞，致使一般社會對於法治觀念及守法精神，趨於薄弱，此實爲建設法治之一大障碍。消除此種障碍，固有賴於國家各部門及社會各方面之努力，而司法人員隨時接近民衆，又爲民衆解決紛爭，尤當特別注意宣導，潛移默化，使一般社會養成法治之習慣，人人以崇法爲義務，以守法爲道德，而後法治之推行始可期其迅速普遍，有厚望焉。</p>

<h3>司法行政會議的召開</h3>
<p>司法行政會議於一昨召開於首都，此一會議的召開，緊接着中華民國法學會在滬召開年會之後，對於促進法治，及奠定我國新法系之基礎，意義自至重大。我　主席重視司法，特頒訓詞，以爲勗勉。我們於中華民國法學會年會在滬召開之際，旣曾著論；茲當司法行政會議召開，更願約略抒其所見。</p>
<p>在　主席的訓詞要，我們看見　主席指出國民革命之目的，在三民主義法治國家之建立，並以良好的法律，必須有完善之執法人員及守法之國民，始克有濟。這的確指出了當前癥結的所在。我們所已制定的法律，在理論上，技術上，確是已趕上了西歐及共它國家，但我們距達到法治的理想境域，其間似乎尚有一段遼遠的路程。在過去我們所有的「刑不及大夫」這一套傳統的制度，如今已崩潰了；士大夫旣無「禮」足以遵循，又不怕「刑」的上身，於是到現在我們還沒有養成法治的精神。到現在爲北，士大夫還是中國的統治階級。過去他們的行爲，被傳統的「禮」所拘束，而自處於刑法之外。目前「禮」旣失序，他們還依舊自處於法律之外；中國之所以未能臻入眞正的法治，這不能不說是一個主要原因。如今我們要建立三民主義的法治國家，全國人民所必應遵守的一個原則，便是人人都在法律之下；決不能容許有人可以逍遙法外。欲達到此目的，一方面國民固應守法，另一方面也在執法的嚴明。旣然講法治，這兩方面是互爲關係的；倘使執法不嚴明，人民又何貴乎守法；因無貴乎守法，於是也不免影響到執法的嚴明。老實說，中國一般老百姓的守法精神是相當可佩的，問題就在乎有不自處於老百姓之列的特殊人物。從這一個觀點看來，厲行法治的首要之圖，端在執法的嚴明，使我們完善進步的法律得能發生實效。</p>
<p>講到司法行政方面，與其提高法學敎育的水準，不如擴大法學敎育的範圍。不錯，法學敎育的水準實在應該提高；但在一個厲行法治的國家，必須使極大多數的人能够懂得他們的法律。今日中國的現行法律，爲數已經看實不少，究竟這些法律如何拘束個人行爲，應爲一般公民必要的常識。在這個時候，與其致力於法學的精深研究，似不如致力於法律知識的一般普及。我們固然應該造就法學專家，我們更應促進一般人民的法律知識；必使人民知法，然後纔能望人民守法。至於關於司法的制度方面，我們也認爲提高檢察官的職權，實爲當前的急務。檢察官有執法的責任，而在目前，他所掌握的執法權力，　在有限，往往不能自動有所作爲。因此，他必須與憲警打成一片，這樣纔能達到迅速敏捷以發現罪行，搜索罪證，緝捕罪犯的目的，國家的法律，纔能發揮其效能。</p>
<p>在中華民國法學會在滬召開年會的時候，我們曾說；「講到司法方面，年來在物價高漲，生活動盪的局勢下，全國司法人員的忠於職守，贏得一般的讚佩。在我國司法制度方面，由於居院長的力圖適應時代需要，亦曾不斷有所改進。將來在行憲以後，司法的尊嚴更將提高。一個法系的建立，不僅需要完整的立法，更需耍開明的司法。我們觀乎美國最高法院的判例，如何影響到美國法學的滋長發育，益信司法者地位的重要。在中國新法系的建立上，我們也希望中國的司法界能够有像英美那樣的供獻。」今當司法行政會議的召開，我們也可用以相勉。不過，還有兩點也應値得提出：　法官的待遇必須設法提高，其職位必須永久。目前物資動盪不定，司法人員待遇清苦，我們必須設法提高它。外交官有特殊的待遇，司法官爲什麼不可以也有特殊的待遇？　法官的水準，同時亦必須設法提高，必如此，司法的尊嚴，纔能維持。</p>
<h3>立院大禮堂中歡聲一片</h3>
<p>孫院長宴新疆歌舞團</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日常〕孫兼院長夫婦，五日午假立院大禮堂微宴新浪歌舞訪問團，列新歐務必團全體，府委鮑爾漢，新建設聽長伊敏，吳副院長長鐵城，立委樓桐孫，孫九錄，劉不同等百餘人。首由孫兼院長致歡迎詞，略謂：中國爲一多民族之國家，各民族間諸語言習俗雖各不問，然親愛稍誠之精神，請處表現。今日新省靑年男女以　忻　舞之情緒，參加此次歡迎會，即爲證明。此次訪問團前來首都，寶具有非當偉大與重要意義，彼等此來，以新省各族同胞對國家，對中樞，對主席之愛戴擁護之無上熟情，帶向全國內地同胞，深吩返新時，亦能將全國同胞對彼等一致熱烈誠懇之溫情，帶向新省各族同胞，以增進感情之交流與文化之溝通，並吩能至內地各大都市觀光。孫兼院長繼又述立院重視邊疆及民主情形稱：立院自民十七成立以來，委員由四十九人續增至一四九人，平日討論議案時，向極民主。民。靑兩黨加入後，一貫之民主作風，更見發揚，立院除民主以外，又代表各地，過去新　立委有艾沙，張鳳九等，目前亦有　聲慕廣錄等，將來立委將增至七百餘人，新省代表數額亦將增加哦。新省政府向不修明，人民疾苦亦深，而且前之新疆，則正向自治之路前進，縣長專員皆由民選，其選舉之進行，較內地爲平，足爲內地表率。當前新疆情勞，尚未達最圓滿境地，希望地方自治能更進步，各民族間亦更團結，盼能以建立三民主義民主新中國互相勉勵。詞畢，全塲報以熱烈鼓掌。吳副院長繼起致詞，指出新局較內地爲安定，盼能共她新新趨，更盼歌無訪問團此來能促進彼此文化交流。當吳氏以富有熱情之口吻，高叫今日新疆爲中華民族大家的新疆時，全塲一片堂聲，鮑爾漢。伊敏等鼓掌尤久。旋由鮑爾漢介紹團員與會中相見，當每一團員起立時，掌聲即隨之而起，繼由飽爾漢答詞，簡潔而有力，一再强關新各族同胞與內地問協一家，新各族對中央與領袖咸熱誠擁戴。伊敏致詞，略謂：新疆過去殊爲失當，惟自張治中主新以來，一切即改觀，各族問之融洽與團結實爲歷來所未有，張氏宣不失爲一公正政治家，惜其目的尚朱全部達成。伊氏最後又提出對選舉方面之希望，並謂，訪問團離新時，新秘書長艾沙（前立委）曾託代向立院院長及全體同仁致意。演詞畢，即由新土舞國康巴拉汗等即席表演，至三時許歡散。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約五日廣播：成功湖訊，聯大政治委員會今日以廿票對六票，否決蘇聯所提美蘇軍隊於明年一月一日前退出朝鮮之建議。蘇聯遭遇此次失敗之後，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯立即宜佈染將不參加表決美國務卿爲歇爾所提在明年三月一日前朝鮮在聯合國監督之下舉行選舉之建議。此項表示，顯示蘇聯不願參加聯大政委會於上星期成立準備前往朝鮮之聯合國委員會。今日表決時，贊成蘇聯建議者，僅蘇聯。波闌。南斯拉夫。白俄羅斯。烏克蘭及埃及六國，捷克代表在表決時不在塲。聯大政委會不顧蘇聯集團之反對，繼續表決美國雄議，結果以四十六票對零票通過，蘇聯集團各國拒絕投票，甚至不願作棄權論。蘇聯集團抵制聯合國委員會之宣言，係由島克蘭代表當場宣佈。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖四日電〕聯大政委會今日辯論朝鮮問題，美國所提出之修正建議，僅遭遇蘇波南捷鳥克蘭五國之反對，彼等一致斥責此一計劃，乃「掩護美國　將朝鮮變爲其擴張政策目標之煙幕」而亞洲兩大國中國及印度，則支持美國之建議。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖西日電〕我國今提議佔領軍自朝鮮撤退之時措置辦法，應經簽訂莫斯科協定之四强方面諮商而　訂之。我國所提之此項議案，係於今日下午以對美國之改訂議案草案之修正案形式，提向聯大政委會。按美國之改訂一案草案，原係簡略　訂關於在聯合過所設之朝鮮委會協助下重建朝鮮獨立之方案。我代表顧維釣於提出此項修正案時，闡譯稱，中國在駐朝鮮佔領軍之措施辦法方面，應有發言權，或至少對此等措置辦法，應獲有充分情報之通知，此事甚關重要。蓋此等描置辦法，或將對昆鄰朝鮮之中國領土內有重要反響。顧氏稱，約一週前，余於聲明中說明，中國人民對朝鮮應獲得傎正獨立一節，甚爲關注，蓋朝鮮境內將來所發生至任何事件均將對昆鄰朝鮮之中國東北諸省，發生即時反響。顧氏於直接述及蘇聯所提關於蘇美立即同時自朝鮮撤退之議案時，表示壞疑此醫議案之實效。渠稱，「吾人深爲實識蘇聯議案中之原則，但吾人認爲該議案過於簡單，在此情况下，吾人認爲佔領軍之撤退，只有使朝鮮人民傎能重建獨立，並能維持此種獨立之情況創立後，始可予以實施。」嗣後顧氏並從旁引證以支持其見解稱，據渠所據之情報，自前北韓方面有武裝部隊十五萬人，此種部隊均爲蘇聯所訓練及裝備者，另一方面，據聞在南韓寶無此種所可比擬之部隊。渠繼稱，如此等北韓部隊經南韓人民之同意，統編於朝鮮國軍之內，中國當無反對之意，但如南韓人民加以反對，此將引起嚴重情勢，而致將在昆鄰之中國領土上，發生不可避免之反響。美代表　勒斯提出詢問稱，如中國爲聯合國朝鮮委會之一份子，中國代表團是否可考慮放棄關於要求新佔領軍撤退前四强應互相諮商之修正案。顧氏等稱，朝鮮委會之職務權限，迄今未經制訂。然渠繼續稱，中國代將對此　予以考慮，雖則對此種重要問預之任何嚴後答復，自然必須俟與本國政府之諮商也之顧氏末稱，由於此等理由，中國代表團在上述情形修正之條件下，支特美國之議案。</p>

<h3>日首相罷免平野各黨派已表諒解片山自稱內閣力量增強</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京五日電〕日本各在野黨對於平野事件，均不作直接有力之批評，蓋仍欲靜待社會黨內部分裂之發展。自由黨批評片山不該創此日本政治史上惡例。共產黨則認爲在國會開會期間，首相對於閣僚之進退，似應先徵詢國會意見，此次施行罷免權，實不免有「獨裁」之嫌。參議院方面雖大都承認片山首相罷免平野係合法行爲，惟對其初次使用此項新憲法所規定之大權而未作週詳之考慮，頗覺遺憾。經四日片山蒞會說明使用罷免權之苦衷後，似已諒解。片山亦提出保證，今後將愼重使用罷免權云。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京五日電〕日片山首相對繼任農相問題表示今日即可決定。至於人選將在淺沼及野溝兩人中選擇，以淺沼最爲相宜。片山稱：內閣意見之不一致，早在討論煤礦國營案，經濟力集中排除法案，農業生產調整法案，及追加預算案等重要法案時，即已發表，此次整理，係謀增强內閣之政治力量。今後內閣中西尾，蘆田及其週　勢力將更爲鞏固。至於平野究與保守新黨運動有何關係，現尚未知，總之，因有此次問題發生，保守新黨之出現將受重大影饗，此後內閣將更見穩固云。</p>

<h3>錢江水患消弭</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州二訊〕去年八月，茅以昇領導的錢塘江海塘工程考察團，在考察整個海塘後，他曾對同行的記者說：「治錢江的第一步，要使錢江歸流。」現在海塘工程局成立已經一年多，在這一年多之中，常駐局內的副局長兼總工程師汪胡楨，確已費了許多苦心，在開始接辦塘工的時候，傎是等於兵臨城下，東處失陷，經過搶堵後，西處又失陷了，他們勞怨不辭，不捨整夜的奔波在海塘上，總算把海水抗拒到七里以外去了，</p>
<p>南岸漲沙首先，他們工程師發現從小尖山起至海寗止，在錢塘江中有一塊像橄橄形似的漲沙，這塊漲沙把江流一分爲二，於是使潮頭來時更冲激得洶湧澎湃。這塊漲沙是在淪陷時期畏成的，當時也沒有人去理會海塘，因此逐年坍毀，到卅三四年竟至不可收拾。廿五年時抵禦這洪水的唯一辦法，就是到處以柴塘來搶堵，但終究不是治本辦法，於是在坍毀最烈的陳汶港地方，築了十二個挑水壩，這十二個挑水墉等於注射了十二針有力的針劑，水流漸漸穩定，海寗的漲沙因着挑水壩的關係，直擴展到杭州的喬司，坍塘就此减少了嚴重性。另一面，因爲錢江水流分成兩股的關係，在南岸冲激到南沙，於是坍江也日漸熾烈了。其實，南沙也是漲出來的，在南沙遙遠的後面，才是塘。爲了人民的請求，於是急救南沙，用未罷裝石塊做成挑水　，現在也不坍江了，反而漲出了沙來。</p>
<p>南岸柴塘在北岸，從小尖山到杭州的喬司，沙都連成一條錢了，靠近海塘的水，也逐漸淤起來了。在南岸，南沙的前面，也漲起新沙來了，南北兩岸漲出的新沙，都各有五六里路的寬度，這樣把錢江的水納入兩邊漲沙的中問，錢江歸流了。</p>
<p>關於四堡坍塘的事，原來北岸全程的石海塘，獨缺一堡至七堡是用石條來築成的，因爲當年正築塘時，逢到太平天國之變，後來在同治年間，左宗棠爲搶修海塘，才用柴塘來代替的。道年久的柴塘，當然要坍圯，現在塘工局正努力把木樁夾板來抵禦，並用挑水壩使它淤漲新沙。我們經過時，汪副局長招待我們看因潮水冲激面露出來的柴枝，仍舊歷歷可辨。</p>
<p>築挑水壩目前唯一的問題，就是如何保住漲出的沙，始可以保住石塘，使錢江永久歸流。於是必須要築挑水墻到沙上甚至到沙的外面的適常地方。我們到陳汶港，看他們很多中外技術人員都在努力這一工作。</p>
<p>據汪副局長告記者：「本來築一挑水壩後的新漲沙，須年漲一次，而錢江因爲每天有兩回潮，所以漲沙較快，這傎是「天從人願」了。現在我們一面要保坍，一面仍要把破敗了的石塘補修好。」</p>
<p>爵字號塘我們再到從前最危險的爵字號塘，見已經修成很好的水泥塘，這大塊的水泥磐石，是民國元年做成的，本想以此修塘，後來經當地人士認爲「洋貨」而反對，直到現在民國卅六年塘工局拿來利用。我們又到小尖山，那裏是開山取石的地方，從前京滬杭各報上都有記載計劃炸毀　十門的消息（他們所指的　子門恐怕就是小尖山，其實　子門是在龕山與　山之間，接近南岸。）說炸毀　十門可以通航，可以免潮汎泛濫，現在據工程專家證明，這是毫無根據的。</p>
<p>小尖山上他們說：「我們這樣的炸山，還只去了一個表皮，怎樣可以把它炸光呢？而且，小尖山與潮汎通航兩問題，都無關係。」</p>
<p>小尖山原爲荒凉之地，現在有上百的技術人員和工人在工作着，這裏有十五開羅瓦特的發軍機，有空氣壓縮機，壓縮那鐵錘與鐵鑽去鑽山，山　後又用火藥注入，燃起爆炸成一塊塊大石，大石炸出後，又用小火車頭，（名爲Pony引擎，相等於一福特軍馬力）拖動數十鎭斗，斗中載石，拖往軋石機旁，倒入軋成小塊，又倒還鐵斗，由小小輕便鐵道運往陳汶港做挑水。</p>
<p>水患無虞我們很愉快的明瞭了錢江水患已經沒有可慮的地方，進一步要知道如何利用錢江來繁榮我們的土地。在返歸杭州的途中，我和汪副局長談起錢江通航的問題，他們估計浙贛路每天運貨約爲一千五百噸，其他土貨木材等利用各種方法遝輸的約三千噸，錢江航運佔計暫爲一千噸，則可維持三百噸船三艘，五百噸船二艘。現在，錢江已歸流，惟尚未確定河床，並不知多少深，所以需要測量，需要設標幟，需要再用挑水壩來固定河床，據他們的計劃，擬在四堡設一碼頭，惟須有一鐵道通火車站，使便於啓運。這種手續與工程，需要的經費，以戰前計算，要一千萬元，相等於五百萬美金。這樣的工程要在五年內完成，爲了確保江南的富庶與安全，記者認爲不能再遲疑。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>台灣省的大遺產</h3>
<p>〔本報台北二日訊〕台灣省的最堪珍貴之處就是光復後接收了一筆遺產，這是日本人苦幹了五十年留下來的。白部長，以及最近蒞台的張院長，都曾明確地指出台省的接收是最具成效，處理得也最迅速。可是究克有多少數字，這麼一筆大遺產接收的過程怎樣，人們都很急切地希望瞭解。結束了的日產處理會提供十萬字的總報告：一本精美的冊子。</p>
<p>就房屋，土地，船　，車輛，森林，機器，以及傢具現金等，「帳面」總價値是一五。六六五。三五一。八〇八。三七台元，包括公有財產，私有財產，企業財產。不過，數量和價値係按照接收淸册所列者計算，其未列入的被遺漏了，而若干尤其是軍事機關接受的數字則不在其內。</p>
<p>日產處理會是由嚴家　和何孝怡以二百個職員自三十五年一月開始接收工作，本年四月底結束，這一個機構淸白地完成了光復台灣最基　的工作，以數字記錄下五十年來日本人在台灣的殖民壓榨史。</p>
<p>日產會將接收了的還給省府，由省府關係部門再行處理。省府當局要求台灣省的仍交還省府辦理，這一原則已給此賴的張院長以原則上的同意，不過還須作技術上的研討而決定。</p>
<p>光是接受時的場面價值數字，已經大有可觀，要是以目前的物價指數來算，確是一筆最大的遺產數字，這數字我們應該珍重它，應該好好兒運用它。</p>

<h3>紗商同業昨開會員大會討論如何維持營業議決推代表十人向各當局請願</h3>
<p>本市紗商業同業公會，昨日下午三時，假市商會舉行第二屆會員大會。到會員代表三百餘人，社會局市商會均派代表出席指導。首由主席唐志良報告會務及同業情況。嗣討論提案，該會以會員業務，自政府實施棉紗管制政策以來，遭遇困難，益形嚴重。最近經濟部紡調會頒佈發展紡織工業調商紗布供需實施方案，所援棉紗聯合配銷方法及其　登證配　制，對紗商未有直接配紗之規定，勢將遭遇明存實亡之危機，故提議請求政府維護該業業務。經商討後，決議由大會及理事會各派代表五人，向有關機關請願。呈請全國經濟委員會經濟部市政府紡調會全國紗聯會市商會等要求在棉紗聯合配銷實施後，對該業規定維持營業合法利灣，並對該業棉紗存量予以合法規定，幷函請全國紗商聯會響應。未討論臨時提案，決定　對複雜業出售棉紗，爲避免嫌疑，同業應一致拒絕敗購。　棉紗存貨規定四十五天限期，請當局改革，否則對十支以下，六十支以上棉紗例外，不受限制。　擬組紗商同人聯誼會，呈請社會局核准。大會至五時許始散。</p>
<h3>實銷呆滯人心虛浮粳秈米一致回挫</h3>
<p>雜糧油餅跌多於漲</p>
<p>昨日南北市共到米糊一萬零一百餘石、消化不振，人心虛浮，市况急轉直下，粳米回挫二三萬元，秈米亦低萬餘元，白陰元均跌二萬元，早薄稻猛落三四萬元，北市收盤略挺，南市仍懈。麵粉無錫來貨仍湧，兼之雜牌粉充塞，市化呆木，猛跳六七千元，麩皮去化不暢，實銷冷懈，猛落五六千元。</p>
<p>豆餅客帮納胃平淡，再低二三千元。黃豆仍難生色，疲而不醒。油廠甚懈，本街種寥，客帮甚少，續見下挫萬餘元。蒃豆汕頭轉懈，回跌一二萬元，赤豆廣帮不動，步跌二萬元。蠶豆另消仍細，萎靡不振，步削一二萬元。紅糧隨之下降三四千元，苞米北洋冷淡，納胃仍少，回跌萬元。生仁到消兩平，形居平庸之狀。芝蔴油廠殺短略取，全街仍少進胃，續跌一二萬元，元麥亦隨之下降，見疲三五千元，小麥胃呆而乏交，亦挫萬元。</p>
<p>油市參差不一，生油挺秀，豆油仍疲，淸油挺升一二萬元，生菜油見升二三萬元，熟菜油平平，蔴油漢口貨仍多，續跌二三萬元。</p>
<h3>原棉折合米價比例較前提高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部紡織事業調節委員會下設之議價小組委員會，議定原棉收購辦法，曾暫定以八分之七吋細絨白花一市祖折合當地米價四市石，或小麥七市石爲參考，仍由當地議價委員會參酌當地供應及運繳，議定收購價格，並非予以硬性規定。且按舊時習慣，以三石米易一石棉爲普通標準，此次該會以保障棉晨，鼓勵生產起見，特將比例提高。</p>
<h3>二次棉產估計</h3>
<p>第二次棉產估計，　係根據河北，山東，山西，河南，陝西，湖北，湖南，江西，安徽，江蘇，浙江，四川，遼寗，南京，上海，天津等十五省市十月中旬以前棉情編製而成。</p>
<p>全國棉田面積爲三千八百五十二萬八千市畝，比上次佔計减五十四萬五千市畝；皮棉產額爲一千零五十六萬三千担，比上次佔計减五十二萬八千市担。</p>
<p>本年全國棉情大致良好，病蟲害不多，春旱秋潦較爲普遍，蘇北徐海區水災頗重，惟兵匪之災遍地皆是，秦晋量烈，所幸免者僅湘浙與四川耳。使戰事弭平，棉農能安居樂業，則棉田之增加，當大有可觀。</p>
<h3>統債外股略升</h3>
<p>公債昨告反動，統丙晨開一九四〇〇元，自一九三〇〇元回升至二二〇〇元而後稍平。五〇三室五五二室買進，六一四室五五五室均出，結果較前收計甲乙升一千八，統丙好起二千五，丁戊各升二千元，成交約七百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨亦轉穩健，怡紗最開一八四〇〇〇元，高價一八八五〇〇元，最後在一八五〇〇〇元掙扎，說券帮有供，廣帮洋行帮則出，港申電報縮，航業有售船訊，人心尚好，趨勢甚穩。結果較前收計怡　電話墾植均平，怡紗英聯會德　斗業廣紙業航業鋼業均告微漲。　　華股昨廣帮再在塲內吸收即交永紗，塲外收貨情况良好，中途稍有反動，無如人心渙散，業中大戶斬結者多，穩後再告低落。</p>
<h3>大戶仍多斬結華股初穩後低</h3>
<p>晨初因永紗即交以二七五元，滬交二七七元開後，即有了結即交，供售遞交，而迫降至即交二六五元遞交二六七元低。永公掛低至跌停。兩廣珊力購現永紗，塲外收貨者極股，息價微低至一角八及二角二分半，曾遂漸盤高至即交二七六元，遞交二七七元高價。及廣帮買意稍止後，乘高有賣，稍有低落。其後縱有回升，無奈晨初開盤綫迄難穿出。臨收時塲外突有大量敲出者，亨鼠急行套售，午收永紗現遞都爲二九元，除成交冷落之中紡軋升半成，五和續降一成，永公再告跌停，閘北新亞內衣微升，恒豐平平永公跌停外，即交股均告微降。遞交股計勤興跌半成，餘均微挫。</p>
<p>午後僅做即交，永紗經夜報對中美貨款有提前援助之訊，永紗迫降至二六四元低價，但貸款數目微乎其微，廣帮友小錢莊幫趁賤吸收，會回上至二七一元，無奈大戶葉某在場外了結，王某在塲內斬售，國行交換差出，亦無力支撑，臨收前再見疲落，惟低價時維持者亦多而轉盤。三小熱本身均有努力，反見穩健。結果較最收，即交股計永紗信和麗安微挫，新光景福勤興中海華新中絲微升，閘北美見穩。舊華商及大三則稍回低。</p>
<p>十一月十二日總理誕辰，證交休業一天。第五三期遞交做至十</p>
<p>銀根轉鬆</p>

<h3>土地經濟學</h3>
<p>— 養吾</p>
<p>張丕介著：土地經濟學導論中華書局出版，定價三元五角中山文化敎育館社會科學叢書之一</p>
<p>在各種社會科學之中，土地經濟學是比較最後成立的一種，而我國學術界之注意這門科學，更較歐美各國遲，所以關於這方面的著作，特別稀少。戰前中文出版的土地經濟學，只有章權的一本，那是翻譯美國人伊利Rich　T　Ely的Land　economics。另一本是翻譯日人河田嗣郞的土地經濟論。前者偏重於美國式的土地利用，後者則對地租，地價，地極三方面有比較詳細的討論。兩書各有所偏，而且都不是我國人以我國土地問題爲對象的硏究著作。這不但是我國社會科學中的一點缺憾，對於土地問題十分嚴重，而又急求土地改革的我國，更是一件必須補救的弱點。我們在這一册不過十餘萬言的土地經濟學導論裏，可以明顯的看出來，本書著者對這一點的努力，而且證明，他的努力確也有相當的收穫。</p>
<p>據著者自序說：本　原定計劃有十五章，約十五萬言，除現有十章外，尚有論地價上下各一章，論地權上下各一章，論土地金廠一章。」本　只有十章，而其餘五章，迄至今年再版，並未補人，實爲一件美中不足的憾事。這種情形，恰是我國者作界中，一件很當見的通病，有上册而無下册，有前編而無後編，有上卷而無下卷，使許多比較有希望的研究，往往半途而止。這本　亦不能免於此點，固不足深　，但這種現象實在是我國學術進步的可哀情形。</p>
<p>本書十章，除去普通叙述外，各章都表現出著者對土地經濟學的獨到見解。第一章導論，指出這門科學的研究對象爲「因人類經濟行爲而發生的人與地，人與人，地與地之關係」，確定它的性質爲「實騐科學，人文科學，社會科學」，並特別注重說明定律與趨勢的區別，以强調土地經濟學的社會科學性質。這一章對研究方法的討論，大體上是相當圓滿的。第二章土地之定義分類與特性，並無特異之處，只是土地定義一項，可以見出著者對此問題之重視與其虛心的態度。但第三章土地與人口，却更顯得精采。這裏有一串新穎的見解，如人對土地的依存關係，土地對人悶的容力，以及最後對我國土地與人口問題的對策兩原則。這一段大可爲我國人悶政策的參考：</p>
<p>「第一，在土地容力，未能作顯著之擴張，與我國人口總數，未較世界任何國家爲少之則，不應再採積極之人口增加政策，而應注意改善國民之生活水準，增進國民之體質，以質量之進步，代數量之擬充，以有計劃之人口政策，代盲目之政策。</p>
<p>「第二，在人口質量未顯著增進，而數量無大變動之前，應積極擴大土地對人口之容力，其條件如左：</p>
<p>採用科學技術，提高　殖指數，以擴大國民經濟，尤其農業生產之空問基礎；</p>
<p>推進工業化政策，儘量自農業方面，吸收大宗勞力，以减低農業人口對土地之壓迫，爲改進農業生產之先決前提，</p>
<p>農業生產，應自片面之勞力集約與手工經營，改向於資本　約與科學化合理化之輕營，以長高農業對人口之容力；</p>
<p>國內移植與國外移植，應同時並進，以疏化本國之人口，同時即增加國民賴以生存之空間。」（三六頁）</p>
<p>第四章論土地利用，第五章論農地，第六章論市地，第七章論富源地，統觀這四章的內容，前後關係密切，等於一章之分寫，其中心討論對象，完全集中於　地利用之勢力。陝　　硏究，土地利用的歷史發展，循以下四種巨大趨勢而前進：　利用面積之擴張化趨勢，　利用程度之集約化趨勢，　利用內容之複雜化趨勢，　利用性質之社會化趨勢。這種趨勢的樹立與認識，正是著者在土地利用論方面最成功的</p>
<p>第八，九，十章爲論地租之上中下三篇。據　者自序說：「所佔篇幅最多。此三章取材立論，太半採自吾業師狄爾先生所著理論國民經濟學第四卷地租篇：及其所著其他關於地租之著作。」按　爾爲新近去世不久之歐洲大陸上經濟學成權之一，其思想爲有名之「社會法制學派」。本書著者所受狄爾之影饗如何，本書並不顯著；反之，在地租論關於稅去地租一點上，却可見出其對此問題之獨特見解。著者聲明其立塲，原則上仍擁護地租稅政策與平均地權，但在理論上則反復指明，這一政策與說去不勞而獲之地租，並不能如想像之單純，即實行稅去地租之結果，並不能「百分之百的，不折不扣的」將地租說去，不是不及，便有過之可能。</p>
<p>就本　全部理論與其研究態度而論，著者的特色是謹愼而忠實的，他的獨到見解，也是狠明顯的。作爲初學之參考及硏究土地經濟學之參考，相當適用。不過最令讀者抱憾的是全書未完，全豹難窺，而且只是導論，闡釋申說之處，仍嫌太簡。</p>
<h3>甘地與史達林</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>左傾的新聞記者費希爾（LouisFischer）曾一度站在世界的十字街道上仰望着他認爲的兩顆明星——甘地和史達林；其實他是在朝着史達林的道路上走的，他在蘇聯居住了十四年，並且有了一羣子女。他曾向瑪哈坦（Manhattan）小城的「民族」（Nation）報上撰寫了許多歌頌史達林的通訊。但是到了一九三八年他忍耐不了這種共產主義的獨裁作風，毅然離開了蘇聯，他的太太和子女沒有出來，直到後來再得羅斯福夫人之助回到美國來。一九四一年他在「人和政治」（Menand　Politios書中歌頌了民主和自由，更揭開了這鐵幕後的秘密，因之他的「甘地與史達林」的出版倒是合乎邏　的。費希爾崇拜起甘地了，他歌頌了甘地的」熔理想家的遲疑與革命家的暴躁於一爐的反暴動革命主義」，和甘地一樣，他主張「先改造人後再改造制度」，但是甘地沒有接送他在多年前的對西方國家採取手段的建議，這個小老頭子曾說。「在我沒有說服印度人的暴躁前，我如何去叫西方人採取反暴動政策呢？「甘地的這種脚踏實地的幹法更使作者敬　了。</p>
<p>當作者傾向到甘地以後，他便失刻的批評了史達林，他在書中說道，「政治戰是明顯而複雜的，每天的報紙就是這戰爭中的戰報……無疑飛的我們希望首分之九十和蘇聯作政治戰，但他們部不願用這方法……所以一切根本的美蘇問題，或者獨裁與民主間的問題是無法用外交方法來解決的……這兩大勢力的鬥爭除非一方全勝將永不休止的惡鬥下去。一但是費希爾相信「史達林不需要世界第三次大戰或者世界暴力革命的，他的政略是保特他的統治勢力並且儘可能應用神經戰來擴張勢力範圍以對抗西方國家」，但據作者說蘇聯要作十年的戰選是能支特的。</p>
<p>爲了避免這種新的危機，作者建議除開蘇聯另組聯合國，「廢除否決權，因爲這種否決權已被蘇聯運用來離間民主集國，這個新聯合國不是像一個國際政府似的，而是成一個整體。」這只是消極的，僅此並不能拯救民主與和平，作者認爲積極方面還要付出很大的代價的。</p>
<p>這樣，費希爾認爲資本主義不能對抗共產主義，他認為類似社會主義而帶有「計劃經濟」的才能相抗，他幻想；「國營資本與私人資本可以自由鼓爭……，假使英國工黨失敗，民主世界的前途是很壞的」，「農田就像空氣一樣任人耕耘，那時無買無　，人們的經濟都是平等的……　馬克斯主義和甘地主義混合的加惠於每一個人民身上。」這也許是他的幻想，正如他從前幻想來使史達林和甘地合作一樣。（LouisFischer近著Ganchand　Stalin書，時代雜誌十月六日號刋載書評一則，時譯出以餉讀者）</p>
<h3>英文新字辭典</h3>
<p>— 同芳</p>
<p>葛傳築。桂紹盱。吳鐵聲。吳夢態合編</p>
<p>競文警局出版。三十六年七月初版</p>
<p>文字的產生基於社會的進化，社會愈進化，新字的創造也愈多，而過時不適用的舊字也不知不覺地被淘汰。這次的二次大戰，是近代史上重要的轉捩，整個的世界都發生很大的變動，反映於軍事，政治，經濟，文化，敎育各方面的是新的思想的誕生，舊的傳統的揚棄。代表着「世界通行語言」的英文字彙，也隨着這次的戰爭，產生了許多的字和詞。</p>
<p>只要我們　閱現在英美出版的書報雜誌，我們會發現許多新字和新詞，是在普通字典中所遍尋不得的。許多讀者都苦於閱謮新書報的困難，不是文法語句的看不懂，而是遇着許多新的半和詞而不解。這些新的字和詞影響我們閱謮書報的速率，阻碍了我們的對於書中所述各種事物的領會。除非有一本新辭典出版，我們將無法打破思想上的障　。</p>
<p>這是當前續書界很切用的新工具。最近翻閱之下，覺得頗有獨到之處，爰爲讀者作一介紹。本辭典中所收的字包括　新辭，新習語，舊字新義，舊字新用法和新　語，近一萬條，都是坊間已出的最通行的英漢字典裏所查不到的。</p>
<p>在檢察上有一種便利，，就是宇和辭，都依字母順序排列，辭並不附在任何字的裏面。辭類也會詳細記出，一切辭都被看作字一般。例如allveryfine　if　auything　should　happen　to　on等。關於科學及戰　　面的新字似乎搜羅得特多，這對於閱讀科學書報該有很大的帮助。除英，美的新字外，他國的通用語在目前已被世人公認的字和辭也有搜集。英美新產生的slang　colloquiallsm，在這本辭典中採入　亦夥，這或者很便爲我們讀小說和一般通俗性的期刋。</p>
<p>據編者等在序上所說，編着這本辭典確費過不少心力，於參考英美同性質的辭典以外，更就現代謮物（書報雜誌）上廣事搜求，足見這本辭典的編篡態度是極審愼的和照着英美原本字典翻譯抄襲一遍換過面目在中國出現是迴乎不同的。</p>
<h3>馬可波羅行記</h3>
<p>— 安壽</p>
<p>馮承鈞譯。商務印書館出版</p>
<p>作爲一部史籍看馬可波羅行記，可以獲得兩點重要的帮助。</p>
<p>第一，我們可以　此窺見宋元之際找國人民的生活情形。原來我國史籍（其實舊日西洋史亦如此）有一種巨大的缺點，是重視政治活動而忽略了社會情形。因之我們能够看到許多無關重要的帝王家事，却沒有法子看到比較有系統的關於人民風習的記述。而馬可波羅行記却是對這方面很注意的，如宗敎信仰，衣食狀况，婚喪習俗等，都有記載，雖然爲體裁所限未免零瑣，但對於硏究中國史的人，無疑疑是一項珍貴的材料。</p>
<p>第二，我們可以藉此補充元史的若千記載，元史倉卒修成，謬論甚多。馬可波羅行記中關於政治情形的記載不算多，且不甚詳確，但參考的價値還是有的。例如第二卷中記元軍攻克裏陽，乃得力於西洋火器，就極可相信。其他對於元初宗室諸王的爭殺，元世祖的對外戰爭，也多有和元史互有異同的記載。</p>
<p>原書共分四卷，首卷記現在西亞北部及我國西北的情形，即爲當時馬可波羅從歐洲至蒙古沿途所見聞。二卷記元帝宮庭生活及我國是地各省情形，最爲重要。三卷記日本。越南。印度。南洋諸地區的情形，四卷記西亞洲元代宗室諸王爭殺的史實。舊日的亞洲，是什麼情形，即非專攻元史的人，也想知道」點罷。</p>
<p>這本譯文對於讀者動有許多便利，因爲它經過沙海昂（A　J　H　Chatignon法國人，淸末歸化中國。）和譯者的兩次註釋，糾正了不少錯誤，並提供了許多必需的參考資料</p>
<h3>陀思妥夫斯基的　「窮人」</h3>
<p>— 向秀</p>
<p>幾乎邁高爾基在內，許多人都對陀思妥夫斯基有着可怕的誤解，竟稱他的天才謂「殘酷的天才」。在「天才」上加了「殘酷的」三字，很容易使人對他的性格引起陰森森的感覺。</p>
<p>陀氏果傎殘酷麼？且看魯迅對「殘酷的天才」怎樣解釋：</p>
<p>「凡是人的靈魂的偉大的審問者，同時也一定是偉大的犯人。審問者在堂上舉劾着他的惡，犯人在階下陳述他自己的善，審問者在靈魂中揭發汚穢。犯人在所揭的汚穢中　明那埋藏的光耀。這樣，就顯示出靈魂的深。</p>
<p>「在甚深的靈魂中，無所謂「殘酷」，更無所謂慈悲；但，將這靈魂顯示於人的，是「在高的意義上的寫實主義者」。（見「窮人」序）</p>
<p>這裏，不僅對陀氏是一個公正的論斷，同時也對他自己的作品作了深刻的告白，在深　靈魂的意義上，魯迅與陀氏實有着相似之處的。而且，地們兩個都是從果戈里的作品得到最大影　的人。</p>
<p>陀氏在他作品中，專將那些患　病者，有着變態，犯罪，瘋狂，衰類與神秘性格的人物顯示給我們看。那些人物且永遠和流　，貧苦，員　，飢餓，災病，死刑結合在一起，在他作品中的氛圍，也充滿了恐怖的壓力。展讀它們時，往往引你進入一個慘淡無光，地獄似的陰森的境界，使你慄慄自危，彷彿就站在被審判的刑庭，有人在拷問你的靈魂，你會不敢隱藏起自己的罪過。這裏所謂罪，常然是道德的，不必是法律的，和基督敎的SIN有關係</p>
<p>對陀氏作品，最好的解釋還是用他自己借左西瑪口中說的話：</p>
<p>「別做任何人的裁判者：卑微的愛是比强暴更有力量的一種可怕的勢力。只有這無微不至的愛纔能生出深心。你得去愛人，不要怕他們的罪惡；愛墮落在罪坑裏的人；愛上帝的一切創造者。你也得像小孩與飛鳥似的歡樂。</p>
<p>「生命會給予你許多不幸的事，但爲了這些，你還得快樂，你更須祝福生命，使別的人們也祝福生命。」</p>
<p>其實這位所謂「殘酷的天才」，却是充滿了光明的希望與生之歡樂的，他在那些卑微的人物裏，不斷發掘出他們崇高的愛與生命，面他的作品的傎正意義，就是把「被侮辱與被損害的」崇高的人性顯示給我們。</p>
<p>「窮人」一書，是陀氏的第一部作品。全警以　指號裁寫成的。沒有一個連結的故事，信上談些日常的生活瑣碎，彼此內心的痛苦。一個中年的衰老的數記，窮困了一單十，像一顆永遠不見陽光的小草，生長在陰冷的人間，一個是多病的少女，失去了雙親的孤兒，像一朶被秋風摧落的殘花，到處在飄零着。他們都是不名一文的窮人，上帝却按排他們在一個遙遙相對的地方生活。由於「同是天涯淪落人」，地們暗暗地彼此保護着，用書信傳達愛情，那種超乎他們肉體的心靈的結合，在極其艱難，在受着困厄的生活中緊緊熨貼着。在失望中掙扎，在掙扎中求生，雖然是痛苦，俾有一種極大的幸福。但這種幸福編繼續不久，可憐的少女就被一個中年地主强迫成婚了。她沒有一點反抗的力量，在最後一封信中，她還說：「而今你一定要過慣沒有我的生活了！你將怎樣辨呢！孤單的　下在這裏，我將你拋給誰呢，我的仁慈的，寶貴的，唯一朋友……」</p>
<p>在這絕望的呼聲中，那個老人的心裂碎了。留給他的是一片空白的人生！</p>
<p>一切都寫得鄉樣傎摯動人，在他們的通信中，並刻制出四圍的各秘人物，有部　他們的，也有同情他們的。</p>
<p>具　在「俄羅斯文學」中對陀氏的作品說過這樣的話：</p>
<p>「他的著作因爲表示莊嚴的精神的冒險，很與希臘悲劇相似，可是不是在基督敎的信心與希望上，像希臘悲劇，它們給讀者的是無畏的勇敢的靈感，絕不令人失望；陀氏雖然與　惡面面相覷，從不遮掩或進免那些險惡，但是唯一的目的是要在醜惡罪惡炎尋找良善的靈魂。……」</p>
<p>現在，對所謂「殘酷的天才」，我們也不難明白它傎正的含義了。（此書係韋業　　，文光書店版）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>聽人類的聲音</h3>
<p>— 輪</p>
<p>一一談話言的起源與理論</p>
<p>關於人類語言的起源問題，早就使人們發生興趣了。數十世紀來，無數學者創立了無數的理論，都想說明原始人的語言是怎樣產生的，和世界上怎樣會有這樣多的語言。</p>
<p>古希臘的學者麥陀。薛契里斯基說：「人最初過的是同野獸差不多的生活，因恐懼野獸而聚衆而居，便開始互相認識。但他們的發音還是沒有意義的，不淸楚的；這種聲音最初就不是一種語言。像這樣一羣羣的人全世界都有，於是建立了語言各各不同的根據」。</p>
<p>有不少哲學家臆測原始人是用脫口而出的，不由己的聲音來表達他們最初見到某種東西和現象時所發生的感情和印象。漸漸地這些自然的喊叫變成了這種現象或是物件的固定名稱，因而變成了語言中的單字。</p>
<p>努亞列認爲語言是和最古的人的共同勞動同時產生的，因比，動詞乃是出現在語言中的最初字眼。馮特的意見，音的語言和人的意識同時發生。蘇聯學者尼古拉，雅柯夫列維奇，馬爾確定人類語言的發展是：人們用無數種語言談話，此後人們已經把聲昔和手頭語配合運用了。</p>
<p>不久以前，荷蘭學者望，金乃根說明人類最先的聲音，是從每一個嬰孩都懂得的舌頭和喉嚨的吸入運動發展起來的。從這裏，文字中就出現了最古的把舌頭從牙齒上抽　來所發出的聲音，甚至現在，我們都可以在許多原始部落中聽到這種聲音。原始的語言是由複雜的十音構成，母音的出現要遲得多。音的語言起始得非常遲，馬上就由單字構成。但望，金乃根的武斷是不能使人同意的。</p>
<p>美國的學者桑達古斷定人的祖先從最早的時候，就具有發音器官的不由己的運動，這種運動產生了伴　人類祖先即使獨自一人在自然界條件下所起的感情和體驗的含糊聲。從這種不由己的含糊聲和附有特定的事物，或行動的意義的音響中就出現了單字。後來，這些單字被這個人的同伴所習用了，就變成了整個原始部落的遺產。桑達克的理論還不失其重要性，因爲它說明語言的發展乃是一個有規律的自然過程，它不受任何超自然的勢力干涉</p>
<p>整個故事在一個標準英國風味的飯店裏發生，哥渥特介紹了那些全神貫注傾聽着短波機裏播出的聯合國家戰事報告的英國人，緊張的情緒，渴望的心情；他也介紹了一個英國女閒諜被納粹　風隊員苦刑逼供凌虐致死的幻象。一個地下軍首領對捉住的納粹特務說：「如果你是在怨恨英國人太不好客的情緒下離開人世，請想一想被你們焚毀的英國房屋，被你們搶刦的英國財產，還有被你們刑辱，磨折，殺　的英國人民。你們取去的太多了，就是用血來還債也是還不淸呢！」</p>
<h3>英倫舞台上希魔的嘴臉一齣新劇風靡了英國人</h3>
<p>— 良哉</p>
<p>「如果希特勒登陸英倫」，這是一個多麼可怕的幻想，砲火怎樣轟塌了倫敦的大建築物？鮮紅的火熖怎樣吞噬了千百年來珍貴保守的英國家庭和財產？希特勒的蓋世太保怎樣在全英國橫行不法，謀殺，掠奪，壓迫，磨折，牛馬役使那些紳士風度的英國人？最近倫敦　上演出了「和平！和平Jpeace　in　our　Time的一幕新　，是名劇作家哥渥特Noel　Coward的最新傑作，倫敦人空巷往觀，散塲的時候，覜衆大半俯了頭，有些甚至淚痕未乾，！他們在短短的二三小時中似乎親身經歷了這偭幻想中的大劫難。</p>
<p>哥渥特豐富的想像力，幻出了這樣有力的一個故事，以致有許多人認爲如果倫敦傎的淪於魔手，實際的情形當與此彷彿。</p>
<p>劇情中，邱吉爾，這位英國的抗戰首相，被租擊了。希特勒居然召開議會，組織傀儡政府，羣醜跳樣，鬼影幢幢。但是另一方面，這些善良的英國人拋下了他們的大禮帽，頑强地站起來，他們聚集一切可用的武器，組織了一個强大的地下軍，與納粹周旋。</p>
<h3>楹聯脞語</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>永樂在燕王藩邸時，一日寒甚，飲酒取暖，席次偶得一句云：「天寒地凍，水無一點不成水」，時通衍和尚在座，即應曰：「國亂民愁，王不出頭誰是主」？相與大笑，</p>
<p>當國家昇平人民安樂之時，名流雅土，往往有對酒當雪之舉，相傳瑞安孫衣言先生一日當中與門人對酌，見兒童堆塑觀音，忽然有感曰；「雪積觀音，日川化身歸大海」。思索良久，未得其屬，門人曰：「我有一對，未知可否」？遂唸云：「雲成羅漢，風吹邁步上西天」。衣首先生繫節不已。</p>
<p>有一孝廉，設館課蒙，一日思酒，適門口有一菜販，孝康漫授一壺命之沽，菜廠諦良久，曰：「我有一聯語，先生能對否」？孝廉曰；「試言之」。曰「長頸錫壺腰出嘴」，孝廉瞠目無以應。趨房擬整行裝作歸計，偶於開啓箱篋時悟曰：「方頭鐵鎖腹生鬚」。急出尋菜販，菜販已不知去向矣</p>

<h3>退飛的鳥</h3>
<p>— 林梅</p>
<p>人，獸及蟲類，行走的時候，可以向前，但也可以向左右和向後退行，可是烏類你有見到過退飛的嗎？你的回答常然是沒有。然而，在春秋經上，却明明載有「六鷁退飛，隕石於宋」的記載，鷁是鳥類，這還不是鳥類退飛的明證嗎？因爲我們一直沒有見過退飛的烏，於是我們就要疑心，這或許是荒誕不經的記載；因爲古書上常有一種不科學的荒</p>
<p>實在，退飛的鳥不是沒有的。那種鳥的名字，就是呌做「蜂雀一。春秋經上所說的「鷁」，或許就是這一種蜂雀。</p>
<p>蜂雀是鳥類中飛行能力最强的鳥。在烏類中牠的身體是要算頂小的了。別的鳥類能够在地上的脚不能從這一隻移到另一隻的前面，因此走路也是用翅膀撲着的。因爲牠一直用着翅膀的緣故，所以胸部的肌肉非常的發達，是任何的鳥類所不及的。</p>
<p>蜂雀的腿非常的短，肘深陷在肌肉之內，因爲不能自由運動，所以就沒法走路。爲了要彌補牠這一個缺陷，所以牠就有了向任何方向飛行的本領。牠能够前飛，側飛，上飛，下飛，甚至向後倒着飛。任何鳥類，除了蜂雀之外是不曾倒退飛的。牠不但能够退飛，牠還能在空中停留，俾使牠考慮着飛行的方向。</p>
<p>蜂雀爲什麼要退飛呢？，因爲，牠好似蜜蜂，要向花心去採蛋的。當牠用了細長的喙，刺入到花心中去取蜜，再從花心中把牠的長喙拔出來；牠就不能不向後退了。有時候，牠在倒掛着的花心中找到了可以吃的小昆蟲，牠要川細長的喙去啄食，但又不能躱上花枝而使小昆蟲驚走，那牠只好飛停空中而把長喙去啄牠的點心吃。因了這緣故，所以牠就養成了退飛和停留空中的木領。</p>
<h3>談丁字交通</h3>
<p>— 吳大權</p>
<p>經過我多次注意丁字路口交通驚的指揮之後，發覺指揮法有二大派別：一派是丁「一直」的車輛，在大轉灣的時候，並不禁止丁「一橫」同方向車輛的進行；一派是禁止的。這兩派在車輛交接不繁密的丁字路口，原顯不出什麼優劣，但在車輛交接繁密的丁字路口，就立刻顯出前一派指揮法的不妥，如左圖：</p>
<p>按右圖，如果許丁「一橫」同方向的車輛繼續前進，那末四輛「機動車」須嵌入行列，二輛三輛的「人力車」，也必須嵌入行列，那四輛的要挿入行列，勢必要截斷正在大轉灣的的行列，結果在三角形　的地方，就造成交通　塞的現象。在三角形　的地方，大轉灣的人力車和同方向進行的人力車，旣多且雜，車輛常發生碰衝，形成難分難解的局面，這個形勢，交通就陷入極度的紊亂，於是喇叭亂饗，爭吵口角，動手鬥毆，秩序馬上毀壞了。所以我覺得在丁字路大轉灣的時候，丁「一橫」的軍輛，不問異方向，同方向，都有禁止前進的必要，這一方面的指揮法似應加以統一。</p>
<h3>奇異職務</h3>
<p>— 林林</p>
<p>昆蟲和植物中，有一些確實非常奇異的；而牠們的奇異往往是一般人沒有注意到。</p>
<p>比如植物，那就更奇異了；而道些植物大部生長在熱帶。</p>
<p>「沒娘草」，顧名思義，它是沒有媽媽的，因爲它是無根而寄生在樹桿上的一種植物。</p>
<p>「百年草」是永遠不會死的；如果不被人類取用的話，當你把「百年草」的一張葉子搗爛之後，它的針葉又和許多細而堅靱的筋絲連在一起了；所以中美的紅印度人，就用這筋絲紡織成很堅牢的布匹。</p>
<p>有一種棕樹在葉柄處貯有一個隱秘的水槽，割開葉端就發現大約有一品脫的淸水。「李娜絲藤」也同樣在割開後會流一股潔白的水的。還有一種叫做「母牛樹」的更神奇，割開它的樹桿竟然會流出和牛妨的味道差不多的又甜而又美味的液汁。</p>
<p>有一種攀藤，它生着兩片尖利的小葉子，可以利用來修面和剃　鬚。</p>
<p>北菲還有一種叫「强姦樹」的，它會把人活活地「姦」死，因爲當人們碰到它那枝桿上那「刺激性的部份」，他就被「强姦樹」的樹根捲着，然後死去。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯揭露四強外交秘密</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>我們接獲報告稱，宋式告知他的政府，蘇聯在雅爾達密約之外，有所要求。由於談判是根據了羅斯福總統的囑付而進行的，我倒發生了興趣。深恐宋氏受不了蘇聯的壓迫，在沒有明瞭我們的態度之前，也許再于有所讓步。因之在獲得總統的認可之後，我就通知中國政府說，我們不勸告中國在雅爾迷密約的條件之外，作任何的讓步。</p>
<p>中國和蘇聯後來終於締了約，但是事實所揭示的，我們對於大連所關懷的却沒有看錯。在日本戰敗後二年，大迎仍舊不是一個自由港。在一條船要駛入這港口之前，先要獲得莫斯科方面的准許，不但船隻如此，連船上的人也是如此。</p>
<p>在後來的會議中，史達林對總統和我說，駐莫斯科日木大使曾探詢蘇聯的意思，是不是願意担任結束這次戰爭的居間人。史達林說，這個請求，並不是表示日本，願　像同盟國方面要求的無條件投降；語氣非常籠統，因之莫洛托夫先生僅僅對日大使說，這件事不久當再和他討論。史達林說，後來日本大使又送來了一件公文。裏面說道，日豈願意遺近衛公爵往莫斯科，表示日本意欲結束戰爭，似如要求她無條件投降的話，日本一定以全力作戰到底。史達林補充說，因此會去了一封信給日本大使，說明關於運一點，因爲含混得很，並沒有特殊的建議，無從予以確切的答復，杜魯門總絲對於史達林的舉動，表示贊同。</p>
<p>此時史汀生部長告訴我們，他已接獲七月十六日在新墨西哥試驗原子彈的報告，這炸彈已經盡如人意，一且使用的話，定能將早已立脚不定的敵人，一據殲滅在沒有試驗之前，我們約定，如果蹬明成功的話，一定先給日人以最後的嚴厲警告，然後使用。</p>

        <h1>1947.11.06</h1>
<h3>U.S. State Department Officially Announces: Relief Grain to be Shipped to China by Month's End; Qiantang Seawall Bureau Receives U.S. Relief Funds</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 4th] The State Department announced today that, according to the terms of the relief agreement signed between China and the United States on October 27, 1947, $27.7 million has been allocated under the U.S. foreign relief program to purchase and transport urgently needed relief supplies for China. The current plan stipulates the supply of 50,000 long tons of wheat and 43,000 long tons of rice allocated by the United States, as well as nearly 30,000 long tons of rice allocated by Siam. The remaining portion of the plan largely consists of medical supplies. The procurement of wheat and rice is already underway in the United States and is expected to begin shipping around the end of November. The procurement of rice in Siam will be handled by the U.S. Materials Lending Corporation, entrusted by its agent in Bangkok on behalf of the State Department. China's need for grains is very large, and it is feared that the above plan will not be able to meet China's total needs. Therefore, for maximum effectiveness, the general plan will distribute the U.S. grain supplies mainly in coastal cities. In this way, rural areas that grow grains will not have to transport large quantities of their local produce to urban centers, but instead can meet their own urgent needs.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] U.S. State Department officials said that they have not yet decided which coastal cities in China will immediately receive U.S. relief supplies under the Sino-U.S. agreement. However, it is understood that Shanghai will be included in the prepared list. They also said: "Medical relief supplies shipped to China under this plan will be largely limited to currently manufactured treatments, such as sulfa drugs and penicillin, rather than various vaccines that China can already manufacture and supply."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] Although the U.S. has not officially stipulated that the Chinese Communists cannot receive allocations of U.S. relief supplies to China, the fact that most of the supplies are intended to be shipped to Chinese coastal cities indicates that they will be exclusively for the National Government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] The Qiantang Seawall Engineering Bureau will receive US$2.5 million in relief funds, which are being provided by the American Government's China Relief Organization in accordance with the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement. According to Shao Huan, Secretary of the Relief Organization, he has come to Hangzhou specifically to inquire about the needs of the Seawall Engineering Bureau. According to the Bureau's five-year plan, it is necessary to repair 3,300 meters of collapsed stone seawall, complete navigation, and expand land by 400,000 mu, which will cost approximately US$6.5 million. After negotiation, US$2.5 million has been allocated, and the organization has decided to use US$1 million for navigation expenses and US$1.5 million to repair the collapsed stone seawall. The technical issues of the allocation of funds will be discussed by the Secretary and Mr. Mei, the engineer stationed at the Seawall Engineering Bureau by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in the next few days. It is reported that, with the exception of a small amount of fuel, the remainder will be in cash.</p>
<h3>China's Existing U.S. Dollar Reserves Total Approximately US$340 Million; Report by the World Food Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The World Food Conference, which began its first meeting on the 4th, has had a research report prepared by representatives from eighteen countries. The report points out that the funds immediately available to China amount to only US$87 million, plus other officially held gold dollars and dollar securities, amounting to no more than US$340 million. The report indicates that China has a monthly shortage of US$3-4 million. The study, which includes most countries, was prepared by members of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and its estimates of the gold and dollar positions of each country are as of November 1. The estimates are based on a country's actual trade balance with another country, or a country's trade with the United States, or a country's individual balance of payments with certain specific countries. The report specifically points out that China's existing funds available to pay for all imports are only sufficient for three months, and that other available funds are only sufficient for a few more months. The report estimates that China's monthly food imports amount to US$2 million, which can be covered by existing funds for 42 months, while other funds can only provide for 170</p>
<h3>Congressman Judd Returns to the U.S. via Japan; Talks About Japanese Security in Tokyo; U.S. Newspaper Praises Senator Vandenberg's Call for Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] U.S. Congressman Judd, having completed his data collection trip to China, took a Northwest Airlines flight yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. to return to the U.S. via Tokyo. Mr. Judd stayed in China for over ten days and had extensive contact with both public and private sectors. The individuals he met with in Shanghai were all introduced by the U.S. Consulate General, and their names were kept strictly confidential. However, it is understood that in addition to U.S. business leaders and Chinese financiers, there were also many people from the church and medical communities, as Mr. Judd himself is deeply interested in these areas.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] U.S. Congressman Judd, returning to the U.S. from China, made a brief stop here today and made a statement saying, "If Japan's security is threatened by the Soviet Union, it will have no chance to become an independent and democratic country. We should enable Japan to become an independent, self-sufficient, and democratic country. This is what the American people want."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] The Howard newspaper group praised Senator Vandenberg's view that world problems should not be treated separately, only providing aid to Europe without considering aid to China. The newspaper said, "We have repeatedly reminded the government authorities that avoiding publishing a plan to aid Britain is shortsighted and may even hinder their Marshall Plan. Obviously, Congress will demand that Truman and Marshall determine a proactive policy before allied China is completely destroyed by Red aggression."</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, New York, 5th] The New York Herald Tribune commented on the situation in China, saying, "Although the government army's sabers are superior to those of the Communists, they have still not been able to win a single victory. The main reason is that the government is unpopular in most areas. The reason for the government's defeat in the Northeast is not the strength of the Communist Party, but that the people of the Northeast see no reason to show enthusiasm for the Nanjing government. However, this fact does not mean that China has no hope of escaping the Communist dictatorship, nor does it mean that everything in the current government is bad. There are also some in high positions in the government who are first-class in all aspects and undoubtedly honest. If all the corrupt officials in the government can be imprisoned and the virtuous and honest people are given more power, then the threat of the Communist Party in China will not be as serious as it is now."</p>
<h3>Hu Shih on U.S. Aid to China: Says Willkie's Attitude is Serious</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] Former Ambassador to the U.S. Hu Shih recently published an important commentary in Beiping, reminding the U.S. that loans and aid to China should not harm China's national and ethnic dignity, and opposing MacArthur advising on Chinese affairs. Finally, he suggested that Chen Guangfu, trusted by the U.S., should be in charge of the management and distribution of the loan, instead of other guarantees. Mr. Hu said, "Willkie believes that China should be helped and is worthy of help, and his attitude can be described as extremely serious. As for whether the amount of the loan he proposed is sufficient, it remains to be studied by experts."</p>
<h3>National Judicial Administration Review Conference Opens: He Chongshan Reads the Chairman's Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The National Judicial Administration Review Conference opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th in the auditorium of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Over a hundred members, officials, and guests attended. Before the meeting, President Zhang Qun delivered a speech, saying that he had been in politics in the central and local governments for more than ten years and had always encouraged his colleagues to "respect the law and be pragmatic." Now that the country has embarked on the path of democracy, the rule of law is indispensable. The government's responsibility lies in implementing and enforcing the law, and the cultivation of the spirit of the rule of law throughout the country depends on the efforts of judicial colleagues. Since the abolition of consular jurisdiction, we have been completely equal in law externally, but in reality, China's judiciary is still backward. The organization, equipment, and prison management of courts at all levels are inferior to others and need to be reviewed and improved. Mr. Zhang praised the dedication and integrity of judicial personnel and repeatedly expressed his encouragement and wished the conference success. After Mr. Zhang's speech, he left the meeting to attend the Central Political Committee.</p>
<h3>Xie Guansheng's Opening Speech Encourages the Spirit of Service</h3>
<p>Minister Xie Guansheng chaired the review meeting and delivered an opening speech, first expressing his condolences, encouragement, and welcome to the heads of the high courts from various regions, and then expressing his respect for the legal personnel who had died in the war. He then discussed the purpose of the conference, which was to bring together experts engaged in judicial practice and theoretical research to jointly review the past successes and failures of judicial work and the reforms that should be carried out in the future, based on the principle of considering both ideals and facts, and to discuss and decide on practical and feasible plans. This is the second national conference related to the judiciary, the first being the National Judicial Conference held in the autumn of 1935. The five goals listed in the declaration at that time have been largely achieved after twelve years of effort: Judicial independence, fully funded by the national treasury since 1941, with a proportional increase in the budget each year; The establishment of a legal research institution, the Legal Research Committee of the Judicial Yuan, has been established since the last meeting; The improvement of court organization, with more than 400 courts and more than 600 county judicial offices established in the past ten years; The improvement of legal education, with almost all universities in the country having law departments, and restrictions on student quotas have long been lifted; The abolition of consular jurisdiction, which has been gradually abolished since 1943 to the present. He believes that these gains are still far from ideal, and due to changes in the times and the destruction of war, new shortcomings have also been discovered. This conference should collect opinions from all sides on trials, procuratorates, administration, and prisons, and jointly seek to increase efficiency, make up for shortcomings, and strive to move forward. Finally, he emphasized the encouragement of the spirit of service and encouraged his colleagues to pay attention to the four things: the spirit of revolution, integrity, research interest, and diligence. After Mr. Xie's speech, Secretary-General He Chongshan of the conference read Chairman Chiang's instructions (see lower right corner).</p>
<h3>Ju Zheng and Xu Shiying Call for Pay Raises for Judges</h3>
<p>Subsequently, Ju Zheng, Wang Yunwu, Jiang Yong, Xu Shiying, Lou Tongsun, Zhang Zhiben, Xia Qin, and others delivered speeches, all emphasizing the importance of the judicial undertaking and making various suggestions. Ju Zheng and Xu Shiying both called for the status and treatment of judicial personnel to be improved. Mr. Xu also suggested that the judicial authorities should ensure that the salaries of judicial officials are higher than those of administrative officials when formulating the budget for the coming year. He will do his best to support this, as those who cannot guarantee their own livelihoods cannot wholeheartedly guarantee the safety of the national human rights, lives, and property. Wang Yunwu suggested paying attention to prison labor, which can save national funds and enable prisoners to acquire life skills to rehabilitate themselves. Jiang Yong called on judicial personnel to automatically unify their steps, not to be afraid of the strong, and advocated expanding the powers of high courts and high prosecutorates, paying attention to assessment, improving the system, and increasing efficiency. Lou Tongsun, representing President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, asked judicial colleagues to pay attention to legislative obstacles they encounter at any time with a spirit of courage and assist the legislative authorities in formulating and passing applicable laws. Finally, Zhu Xianwen, a consultant to the Ministry of Justice, who was present as a member, gave a reply, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. Minister Xie hosted a banquet for all members at noon.</p>
<h3>First General Assembly in the Afternoon: Consultant Pound Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>The first general assembly was held at 2:00 p.m., with 105 members present. Chairman Xie Guansheng first decided to divide the 552 proposals into four groups for review: System, Law, Personnel Accounting Statistics, Prisons and Others. Then Consultant Pound was invited to deliver a speech on "Modern Judicial Problems," which was translated by Yang Zhaolong, Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Law. However, due to time constraints, only about half of the entire topic was covered. Then the heads of the four high courts of the capital, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Jilin made work reports, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Simultaneously Announce National Assembly Candidate List in All Electoral Districts; Party Lists Submitted to Chairman Chiang for Review</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] National Assembly candidates will be announced in all electoral districts on the 6th. Then, the election offices of each county and city will submit their lists of candidates to the provincial election offices, which will then forward them to the central election office for filing. The first batch of National Assembly candidate lists for national occupational and women's groups has been reviewed and will also be announced at the national occupational and women's election offices on the 6th. Regarding the party nominations, after they are sent to the central election office, those participating in regional elections will be sent by the central office to the provincial election offices, which will then inform the county and city or equivalent district election offices for registration, review, and announcement in accordance with the law. Those who are candidates for occupational and women's groups will be reviewed and announced by the central office and the national occupational and women's groups election offices.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The review work of the National Assembly candidate party nominations is being carried out by the Central Election Steering Committee in groups day and night and has now been completed. The list was originally scheduled to be sent to the central election office on the 5th for announcement on the 6th. However, for the sake of caution, it was decided that the entire list would be submitted to Chairman Chiang for final review after the review was completed, and then sent to the central election office. According to people in the central election office, the list may arrive at 3:00 a.m. on the 6th, but the announcement period for the list starts on the 6th and lasts for a total of five days, so it will not delay the general election. On the morning of the 5th, all election-related institutions were brightly lit, busy with submitting and announcing the lists, and the candidates were also on the edge of their seats, extremely nervous.</p>

<h3>Yulin City Turns from Danger to Safety: The Chahar-Suiyuan Field Army is Advancing Rapidly Southward</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 5th] Military News: The battle of Yulin has turned from danger to safety. Reinforcements from all directions are about to arrive and encircle the rebel army on the outskirts of the city. Although the rebel army has been attacking the city fiercely for days, its casualties are too heavy and its morale has declined. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the defending army launched an attack and annihilated a company of the rebel army, capturing many prisoners. It is reported that two brigades of the Communist rebels are preparing to withdraw. In addition, the Air Force has been providing air support day and night, posing a great threat and damage to the rebel army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 4th] The focus of the battle of Yulin has shifted to the desert area from the Shaq Wangfu to Yulin in the Kongsak Banner. The Chahar-Suiyuan Field Army is advancing rapidly southward under the command of Deng Binshan. Shaq Wangfu has an air force base, and the National Army's supply is smooth. The defending army in Yulin City has been tested for nine days, and its morale is becoming more and more stable.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shixia, 5th] It is reported that the battle on the outskirts of Yulin City is still ongoing on the 5th. Powerful units of the National Army reinforcing Yulin have departed from Dingbian and will soon reach the outskirts of Yulin City.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] On the night of the 4th, the Air Force dispatched forces overnight to bomb the remnants of the rebel army on the outskirts of Yulin.

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Arrives in Nanjing: Reports to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, left Nanjing in mid-October for a vacation to tour Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Taiwan. He returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 5th. Mr. Zhang will stay in Nanjing for a short period of time and will return to Xinjiang after reporting and seeking instructions. Xinjiang Provincial Government Member Burhan and the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe all visited Zhang for a long conversation. Mr. Zhang was also summoned by Chairman Chiang at 8:00 p.m. to go to the Huangpu Road residence to report.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Instructions to the Judicial Administration Review Conference: Points out that a Country Ruled by Law Must Have Three Basic Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions to the Judicial Administration Review Conference is as follows: To implement constitutional government, the rule of law is of paramount importance, and the promotion of the rule of law should be centered on the judiciary. At a time when the new constitution is about to be implemented, it is necessary to gather senior judicial administrative personnel from across the country in one place to review the past, plan for the future, and seek reforms in the judiciary. In the past, our country suffered from the constraints of consular jurisdiction by the great powers, which led to the obstruction of the exercise of judicial power and the infringement of national sovereignty. After 1933, legal rights were fortunately recovered one after another, and our government's many years of movement to recover legal rights finally succeeded. This has special significance and is very gratifying in the judiciary. However, we should also reflect on the fact that the reason why legal rights could not be recovered for so long in the past was that the great powers always used the poor judicial system and prison system of our country as an excuse. Regardless of whether their criticism is correct, now that legal rights have been completely recovered, we must make the greatest determination and the best efforts to seek thorough reform of the judiciary, so as to adapt to the needs of national construction internally and refresh international impressions externally. Our country was founded on the Three Principles of the People, and the implementation of the Three Principles of the People must rely on the law, and the execution of the law must rely on the judiciary. Therefore, the judiciary is the most important department for promoting the rule of law and implementing the principles. We can also say that the purpose of the National Revolution is to build a country ruled by law based on the Three Principles of the People. The construction of a country ruled by law must have three basic conditions: First, there must be a perfect law. Since the establishment of the National Government, various laws and regulations related to the judiciary have been promulgated one after another, in a comprehensive and grand manner. However, whether they fully comply with national conditions and social needs, and whether there are any inconsistencies or difficulties in implementation after implementation, judicial personnel should use their professional expertise and practical experience to study their advantages and disadvantages, and put forward concrete opinions for the reference of legislation, so as to make the spirit of legislation and the judiciary consistent, and achieve the effect of promoting and maximizing benefits. Second, there must be sound law enforcement personnel. If there is a law but no one to govern it, even if there are good laws and good intentions, they will not be put into practice. Therefore, Mencius said: "A law cannot be enforced by itself." Judicial personnel are responsible for enforcing the laws of the country and must be prudent and fair, based on impartiality and sincerity, and sincerely relieve people of pain and reduce litigation burdens. In hearing cases and dismantling prisons, they must be reasonable and reasonable, and in line with the provisions of the law, that is, take into account the three aspects of reason, emotion, and law. It should be known that the highest ideal of the Three Principles of the People is the harmony of emotion, reason, and law. Nationalism is based on emotion, democracy is based on law, and people's livelihood is based on reason. Only when the three are mutually harmonized can a perfect and ideal society be created. Knowing this, and then applying the law, can the most just judgment be obtained. Third, there must be law-abiding citizens. In the past, our country was bound by unequal treaties, which caused great damage to national laws and social order, which led to the weakening of the general social concept of the rule of law and the spirit of law-abiding. This is a major obstacle to building the rule of law. Eliminating this obstacle depends on the efforts of various departments of the country and all aspects of society, and judicial personnel are always close to the people and solve disputes for the people. They should pay special attention to publicity, subtle influence, and make the general society develop the habit of the rule of law, and everyone regards respecting the law as an obligation and abiding by the law as morality. Only then can the promotion of the rule of law be expected to be rapid and widespread.</p>

<h3>Announcement of the Democratic League (Continued from page 1)</h3>
<p>The China Democratic League has consistently advocated democracy, peace, unity, and unification. Unfortunately, the war is escalating, and its members are deeply saddened and have no room to serve the country. Recently, the government declared the Democratic League an illegal organization and banned its activities. Its members are unable to carry out any activities. Huang Yanpei, a standing committee member, has been publicly recommended to represent the members and go to Nanjing from Shanghai to negotiate with the government on the aftermath. The government has proposed the following measures:</p>
<p>The government has declared the Democratic League an illegal organization and hopes that the Democratic League will end itself and release the persons in charge from responsibility.</p>
<p>Regarding real estate: 1. The houses and properties managed by the Democratic League on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party should be immediately handed over to the government for reception; 2. The houses owned by the Democratic League can be received later; 3. The houses allocated to the Democratic League by the government should be returned. If they cannot be moved out temporarily, they can be borrowed temporarily; 4. The personal residences of the members will not be interfered with; 5. The houses on Zhu Bao San Road in Shanghai, which the Democratic League held in trust for the CCP, will also be received by the government. If the schools cannot move out temporarily, other methods for borrowing should be discussed.</p>
<p>Standing Committee member Huang replied as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Democratic League has been regarded as an illegal organization by the government, it can only notify its members to stop their activities. After this notification, if any members make any remarks or actions, they shall be responsible for their own actions.</p>
<p>Regarding the points on real estate, we will comply with them, but it should be supplemented that the Democratic League has no property of its own. If there is any property owned in common, please allow the Democratic League to handle it itself.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two requests:</p>
<p>All members of the League in various places shall be exempted from registration and shall enjoy all legal freedom.</p>
<p>If the government considers that members of the League in various places have engaged in illegal acts, and those who have been arrested for cases, shall be dealt with by the government in accordance with the law. If there is no factual evidence of Communist Party membership, the "Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area" will not be invoked.</p>
<p>The feasibility of the above points is requested for instruction. As for the various documents published in the newspapers, some of them severely criticize the Democratic League and distort the facts. We will not elaborate on this matter at this time.</p>
<p>The government's response is as follows:</p>
<p>If the Democratic League can declare its own dissolution and cease activities in accordance with the official announcement made by the spokesman of the Ministry of Interior, the registration procedures for members of the League in various places can be exempted, and legal freedom will be guaranteed. However, if anyone uses the name of the League to engage in illegal activities in the future, the local security organs will still handle them in accordance with the law. All League members who have been arrested for cases, if the judicial organs, based on factual investigations, determine that they are not members of the Communist Party or are not working for the Communist Party, the provisions of the "Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area" will not be invoked.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the various points concerning real estate, they can all be handled accordingly, etc. The progress of the consultations will be announced to the public, and members will be notified that they will cease political activities from this date. All members of the League's headquarters will resign from this date, and the headquarters will be dissolved on the same day. We hope for public understanding. Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, November 6, 1947.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Makes Important Revisions to the Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area</h3>
<p>[Our correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] The Executive Yuan recently made important revisions to the Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area, which were promulgated last month. There are two main points of the revision: 1. The original provision that those who leave the party should be placed under supervision for one year has now been revised to state that if there is a reliable guarantor, they may be granted freedom and exempted from supervision. 2. The original provision that communists who are approved for registration may be subjected to ideological training and labor service has now been revised to remove the provision for labor service. The revised articles have been approved by the National Government and promulgated for implementation. The revised articles are as follows:</p>
<p>Revised Articles 3, 7, 10, and 11 of the Measures for the Disposition of Communists in the Rear Area:</p>
<p>Article 3: Persons who leave the Communist Party in accordance with the provisions of these measures shall be properly supervised by the local government and security organs. After one year, if the assessment confirms that there is no illegal or treasonous conduct, their previous conduct may be exempted from investigation. If a person subject to supervision under the preceding paragraph has a reliable guarantor responsible for guaranteeing their conduct, they may be granted freedom and exempted from supervision.</p>
<p>Article 7: Persons approved for registration in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article may be subjected to ideological training, but if a person meets one of the following conditions, they may still be exempted from part or all of the period of ideological training: 1. They joined the Communist Party or worked for the Communist Party before the promulgation of the Mobilization Order for Suppressing the Rebellion, and after the promulgation of the Mobilization Order for Suppressing the Rebellion, they have not made any statements or taken any actions that violate or hinder the mobilization. 2. They held a substantial position in the Communist Party and have voluntarily ceased activities after the promulgation of the Mobilization Order for Suppressing the Rebellion.</p>
<p>The measures for ideological training will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Article 10: Persons who have been approved for registration after leaving the Communist Party may, during the period of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, be granted special permission by the competent authority to hold public office, but those who are required to undergo ideological training in accordance with the regulations may not be granted special permission unless they have made special achievements or have special reasons.</p>
<p>The special permission referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be jointly approved by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>Article 11: Any existing organs or organizations in various localities that were established by the Communist Party, or that are found to be related to the Communist Party, shall be closed down. Their houses and all property shall be handed over to the local government for disposal in accordance with the law, except for those that have been proven to be owned by others, which may be returned.</p>
<h3>Zhu Kezhen Arrives in Nanjing to Discuss the Yu Zisan Case</h3>
<p>Security Police Have Three Points of Responsibility</p>
<p>[Our correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University, arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 4th and met with reporters from this newspaper on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss in detail the case of Yu Zisan, Chairman of the Student Self-Government Association of the school, who was arrested and died tragically. Zhu told reporters that he had spoken to Hangzhou by telephone on the morning of the 5th, and the students had decided to suspend the strike for five days from that day to await the results of the court's handling of the matter. Zhu said: The primary suspect in Yu's death and the origin of the weapon used to injure him still need to be investigated, and the cause of his death may become an eternal mystery. However, even if it is assumed that Yu committed "suicide," the security police have at least three points of responsibility: 1. Failure to transfer him to the court within the statutory time limit of 24 hours. Yu was arrested late on October 25 and died tragically on the 29th. During the four days of his detention, the Zhejiang University authorities repeatedly requested that he be transferred to the court in accordance with the law, but the security police repeatedly delayed. 2. Failure to prevent the deceased from "committing suicide." Judging from the environment at the time, the source of the weapon is highly suspicious. 3. Creating reasons for the deceased to "commit suicide." After Yu was arrested, some students went to visit him, and Yu burst into tears. Regardless of Yu's crime, the security police cannot evade their responsibility for these three points of illegality and dereliction of duty. Zhu said: Whether Yu and others are communists or are related to the Communist Party can be determined by evidence. However, in any case, according to the Outline for Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion, the means of handling it must be carried out in accordance with the law. In short, the school's position is that this is a legal event, and its final outcome will determine whether the government's spirit of the rule of law is fully demonstrated and whether it is willing to protect human rights. Zhu said: Yu is from Shandong, and the school has notified his family, but there has been no reply. He was studying agriculture at the school and was scheduled to graduate next year. Zhu met with Minister Zhu Jia-hua at 11:00 AM on the 5th to explain the incident, the school's position, and the students' wishes. He will also call on the ministers of the judicial and political departments within days. In addition, he will contact the Executive Yuan to request that Zhejiang University faculty and staff receive additional benefits in kind and will return to Hangzhou in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Professors' Association Declaration Acknowledges Two Points of Suspicion in the Yu Case</h3>
<p>Demands Thorough Investigation to Reveal the Truth</p>
<p>[Our correspondent in Hangzhou, 5th] The Zhejiang University Professors' Association issued a declaration on the Yu Zisan case, stating that there are two suspicious points about Yu's suicide: 1. When Chief Instructor Gu went to visit the student, he saw that the glasses he usually wore had been removed, and a pack of cigarettes was sent in. According to the guards, eyeglasses are made of glass, and matches are used for smoking, which are all not allowed. This means that the prevention of his suicide was quite strict, so why did he allow him to use a piece of glass five or six inches long to commit suicide? 2. When President Zhu arrived at the Security Command on the evening of the 29th, the person in charge showed a piece of glass. President Zhu asked where the piece of glass came from, and the answer was either "I don't know" or "It's the window glass in the room," but the remaining broken glass in the window in the room cannot be pieced together with the bloodstained glass. Therefore, they demand that the government investigate the matter thoroughly to reveal the truth.</p>
<h3>Student Strike Trend Spreads</h3>
<p>Yanjing University Professors Issue Written Statement</p>
<p>[Our correspondent in Beiping, 5th] Following Tsinghua University, Yanjing University began a two-day strike today. The Sino-French University began a strike this afternoon. As a result of student signatures at Peking University, 75% approved the strike. Therefore, it will be decided at a meeting tonight whether to strike tomorrow for one day. Chaoyang University is also signing names to decide whether to strike. Yanjing University professors held a meeting this afternoon and decided to issue a written statement on the Yu Zisan case to express their attitude. Hu Shi summoned representatives of Peking University students for talks at 4:00 PM this afternoon and declined to explain the content of the talks. The students only said that Hu expressed his sympathy to them. In addition, the students also visited professors to ask them to express their attitudes. Among them, Ji Yuan, Chief Prosecutor of the Hebei District Court, who also teaches at Peking University, said that the soldiers guarding Yu Zisan were negligent and should not be held legally responsible. He had other opinions on the matter of suicide by glass. Hu Shi is trying to prevent the situation from escalating in many ways.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Peking University students requested to visit the arrested students Meng Xian-gong and Li Gong-yi. Zheng Tian-ting, Secretary-General of Peking University, and Zhao Nai-bo, Director of the Department of Economics, will go to the Garrison Command today to negotiate and request their release or transfer to the court. The Garrison Command did not allow students to visit due to military relations, and the transfer to the court has been requested from the central government for approval. However, Zheng and others happened to see Meng and Li passing through the courtyard at the time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 5th] It is reported that Yanjing University faculty and staff, in the midst of a two-day student strike, wrote to US Ambassador Stuart on the 5th to protest the Hangzhou incident. It is claimed that only three teachers did not participate in the protest.</p>
<h3>Fujianese Criticize Philippine's Absurd Attempt</h3>
<p>Taiwan and Ryukyu Are Inseparable</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 5th] After the Manila Bulletin revealed that the Philippine government opposed the return of the Ryukyu Islands to China and would seek to determine the political status of Taiwan through "national self-determination," it aroused strong anger and antipathy among the people here. People generally criticized the Philippine government's attempt, regardless of its motives, as an unfriendly gesture toward its close neighbor. Some people pointed out that Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands are inseparable, both being parts detached from the Chinese mainland, just like Hainan Island and the Xisha Islands. Moreover, the people of Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands are all Chinese people, belonging to the same bloodline and the same culture. Where does the so-called national problem come from? The population of Taiwan is 8 million, and the Gaoshan ethnic group accounts for only 130,000 people. They live in harmony with the more than 5.8 million Han people. This minority ethnic group has no problems of any kind.</p>
<p>[Our correspondent in Taipei, 5th] Qiu Niantai, Chairman of the Kuomintang Department, told reporters that Taiwan province and the Chinese nation cannot be separated. The Taiwanese are all people from Fujian and Guangdong. It is no different from asking Fujian and Guangdong to determine their own destiny. This is either the Manila Bulletin's insensitivity to the situation in Taiwan or an intention to insult, which is absurd. Provincial Senator Huang Chunqing said: I dare to guarantee that the Taiwanese people have no such intention and will always be descendants of the Yellow Emperor. It is by no means something that the insane theory of the newspaper can shake in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Zhudong Branch Line in Taiwan Opens to Traffic</h3>
<p>[Our correspondent in Taipei, 5th] The Zhudong branch line in Taiwan was built and opened to traffic. The Zhudong district town in Hsinchu City is presenting an unprecedentedly lively scene today. Weng Wenhao, Wei Daoming, Chen Qingwen, Fei Hua, and more than 300 guests from the Railway Commission, after riding a special train and nailing a road spike at the starting point of the new road, arrived in this small town in forty minutes. Welcomed by thousands of people, the opening ceremony was held next to the station. Weng encouraged fellow countrymen to work together to ensure the smooth flow of goods and the development of transportation. Wei said that the provincial government not only restored the old but also did not forget the new construction and guaranteed the extension of the line. Speaker Huang said: We can be confident that we can still engage in construction in the midst of destruction. The Taiwanese people are willing to thank Director Chen Yi, Chairman Wei, and those who are dedicated to this work, and Mr. Weng will definitely provide assistance in development. After having lunch at the Cement Factory, they left Zhudong at 2:00 PM amidst the cheers of the people. The second phase of the project will cost 1.5 billion, and Finance Director Yan Jiagan said that there were no difficulties, but the materials were a problem, but the line must be extended 12 kilometers to Neiwan to have economic value.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Fourth Steel Plant to Hold Furnace-Opening Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] The Fourth Steel Plant of the Taiwan Copper, Iron, and Machinery Company, which was damaged during the war, has now been repaired and is scheduled to hold a furnace-opening ceremony on the 6th, with Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resource Committee, who came to Taiwan to inspect, presiding. Weng has been traveling all over the island recently, inspecting construction projects, and is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Culprit in Guangzhou Import License Case Apprehended</h3>
<p>Corruption Reaches Over 20 Billion</p>
<p>[Our correspondent in Guangzhou, 5th] The case of the import license, which caused a sensation in the Guangzhou market a few days ago, has now been solved by Yong Jiangshi, after a merchant made a secret report. The persons who forged the licenses were Zhong Yaotian, Secretary of the South China Branch of the Import Management Committee, Xie Zhaofen, Consultant, and Huang Wenguang, Clerk. They have now been detained and interrogated by the court. It is reported that Zhong and others made a profit of over 30 billion yuan from forging the licenses, which is the largest corruption case in South China. It is also learned that in addition to the licenses forged by Zhong and others, the licenses issued by the former Guangzhou office of the Provisional Import Management Committee are also without legal basis and have been sent to the court for handling by the South China Branch. It is reported that the case is greatly related to Mai Zuoheng, the former director of the Guangzhou office of the Provisional Import Management Committee, who is now in Shanghai. The South China Branch of the Wheel Management Committee has announced that the licenses are invalid and is awaiting court processing.</p>

<h3>Offspring of Wealthy Family Murders for Money A Tragic Murder Case Occurs in Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our correspondent in Hankou, 5th] A sensational murder case occurred in the business district here on the morning of the 3rd. The deceased, Wang Shaobo, was a yarn merchant broker. The murderer, Liu Youfang, is the descendant of Liu Youyu, a wealthy man in Wuhan, and owns several yarn factories and silver shops. Liu lost money due to extravagance and was disdained by his family. He then planned to murder for money. Taking advantage of a large transaction with Wang Shaobo, he lured him to the basement of the Liu residence, first administered anesthetic drugs, and then inserted a five-inch iron nail into Wang's temple, killing him instantly. After searching the deceased for two checks worth 490 million yuan and a gold watch, he carried the body to the suburbs, hoping to destroy the evidence. The incident was discovered by the local chief, and the thousand criminals were arrested. They are currently being escorted to the police station by the criminal police team and will be sent to the court for strict handling.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Convening of the Judicial Administration Conference</h3>
<p>The Judicial Administration Conference was convened yesterday in the capital. The convening of this conference, closely following the annual meeting of the Chinese Society of Jurisprudence held in Shanghai, is of great significance for promoting the rule of law and laying the foundation for China's new legal system. Our Chairman attaches great importance to the judiciary and has issued a special instruction to encourage it. We have written an article on the occasion of the annual meeting of the Chinese Society of Jurisprudence in Shanghai. Now, when the Judicial Administration Conference is convened, we would like to express our views briefly.</p>
<p>In the Chairman's instruction, we see that the Chairman pointed out that the purpose of the National Revolution is to establish a legal state based on the Three Principles of the People, and that good laws must have sound law enforcement personnel and law-abiding citizens in order to be effective. This indeed points out the crux of the current problem. The laws we have already formulated, in theory and technology, have indeed caught up with Western Europe and other countries, but we seem to be still a long way from achieving the ideal realm of the rule of law. In the past, we had the traditional system of "punishment does not extend to high officials," which has now collapsed. High officials have neither "etiquette" to follow nor fear of "punishment," so we have not yet developed the spirit of the rule of law. To this day, high officials are still the ruling class in China. In the past, their behavior was constrained by traditional "etiquette" and they placed themselves outside the scope of criminal law. At present, "etiquette" is out of order, and they still place themselves outside the law. This cannot but be said to be a major reason why China has failed to achieve genuine rule of law. Now that we want to establish a legal state based on the Three Principles of the People, one principle that the people of the whole country must abide by is that everyone is under the law and no one can be allowed to be above the law. To achieve this goal, on the one hand, citizens should abide by the law, and on the other hand, the law should be strictly enforced. Since we are talking about the rule of law, these two aspects are interrelated. If the law is not strictly enforced, why should the people bother to abide by the law? Because there is no need to abide by the law, it will inevitably affect the strict enforcement of the law. Frankly speaking, the law-abiding spirit of the average Chinese citizen is quite admirable. The problem lies in the special individuals who do not consider themselves to be among the common people. From this point of view, the primary task of rigorously implementing the rule of law lies in the strict enforcement of the law, so that our sound and progressive laws can be effective.</p>
<p>Speaking of judicial administration, it is better to expand the scope of legal education than to improve the level of legal education. It is true that the level of legal education should be improved, but in a country that rigorously implements the rule of law, most people must be able to understand their laws. Today, the number of current laws in China is quite large, and how these laws bind individual behavior should be necessary common sense for the general public. At this time, it seems better to devote ourselves to the general popularization of legal knowledge than to the in-depth study of law. We should certainly cultivate legal experts, but we should also promote the legal knowledge of the general public. Only by making the people aware of the law can we expect them to abide by the law. As for the judicial system, we also believe that raising the powers of prosecutors is an urgent task at present. Prosecutors have the responsibility to enforce the law, but at present, the power to enforce the law that they have is limited and they often cannot take action on their own initiative. Therefore, they must work closely with the military police in order to achieve the goal of discovering crimes, searching for evidence, and arresting criminals quickly and promptly, and the country's laws can be effective.</p>
<p>At the annual meeting of the Chinese Society of Jurisprudence in Shanghai, we said: "Speaking of the judiciary, in the past year, under the situation of rising prices and turbulent living conditions, the national judicial personnel have been loyal to their duties and have won general praise. In terms of China's judicial system, thanks to the efforts of the President of the Judiciary to adapt to the needs of the times, there have been constant improvements. In the future, after the implementation of constitutional government, the dignity of the judiciary will be further enhanced. The establishment of a legal system requires not only complete legislation, but also enlightened judicial administration. We observe how the precedents of the United States Supreme Court affect the growth and development of American jurisprudence, and we believe more in the importance of the position of judicial administrators. In the establishment of China's new legal system, we also hope that China's judicial circles can make contributions like those of the Anglo-American judicial circles." Now, when the Judicial Administration Conference is convened, we can also encourage each other in this way. However, there are two points that should also be mentioned: 1. The salaries of judges must be raised by any means possible, and their positions must be permanent. At present, materials are fluctuating and unstable, and judicial personnel are paid poorly. We must find ways to improve it. Diplomats have special treatment. Why can't judges also have special treatment? 2. The level of judges must also be raised by any means possible. Only in this way can the dignity of the judiciary be maintained.</p>
<h3>Cheers Echo in the Legislative Yuan Auditorium</h3>
<p>President Sun Fetes Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] President Sun, along with his wife, hosted a small banquet at noon on the 5th in the Legislative Yuan Auditorium to welcome the Xinjiang Song and Dance Visiting Troupe.  Present were all members of the Xinjiang Troupe, Government Committee Member Bao Erhan, Director of Xinjiang Construction Ting, Yi Min, Deputy President of the Legislative Yuan Wu Tiecheng, Legislative Committee members Lou Tongsun, Sun Jiulu, Liu Butong and over a hundred others. President Sun first delivered a welcoming speech, stating roughly: China is a multi-ethnic country, and although the languages and customs of each ethnic group are different, the spirit of mutual love and sincerity is evident everywhere.  Today, young men and women from Xinjiang Province are participating in this welcoming reception with joyful singing and dancing, which serves as proof of this.  This visit to the capital by the visiting troupe is of extraordinary significance and importance. They bring to compatriots in the interior of the country the unparalleled sincere affection of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province towards the nation, the central government, and the Chairman. It is hoped that when they return to Xinjiang, they will also bring to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang the warmth and sincerity of the people throughout the country towards them, so as to enhance the exchange of feelings and cultural communication.  Furthermore, it is hoped that they will be able to visit major cities in the interior for sightseeing. President Sun went on to state the importance the Legislative Yuan attaches to border regions and democracy, saying: Since its establishment in 1928, the number of Legislative Committee members has increased from forty-nine to one hundred and forty-nine.  Discussion of proposals has always been extremely democratic.  After the Kuomintang and Youth Parties joined, the consistent democratic style has become even more pronounced.  In addition to democracy, the Legislative Yuan also represents various regions.  In the past, Xinjiang Legislative Committee members included Ai Sha and Zhang Fengjiu, and currently there is Yi Simuguanglu. In the future, the Legislative Committee will increase to over seven hundred members, and the number of representatives from Xinjiang Province will also increase. The Xinjiang Provincial Government has been working towards improvements, and the people's hardships are deeply felt. Furthermore, Xinjiang is moving forward on the path of autonomy. County magistrates and commissioners are all popularly elected, and the election process is more fair than in the interior, serving as a model for the interior. The current situation in Xinjiang has not yet reached its most perfect state. It is hoped that local autonomy can be further advanced, and that all ethnic groups can be more united.  May we encourage each other to build a new democratic China based on the Three Principles of the People. After the speech, the entire venue responded with enthusiastic applause. Deputy President Wu then delivered a speech, pointing out that the new situation in Xinjiang is more stable than in the interior, and hoping that they can work together to create a new trend. He also hoped that the visit of the song and dance troupe could promote cultural exchange between them. When Mr. Wu, in an enthusiastic tone, loudly proclaimed that today's Xinjiang is the Xinjiang of the great Chinese nation, the entire venue erupted in cheers. Bao Erhan and Yi Min and others applauded for an especially long time. Then, Bao Erhan introduced the members of the troupe to the meeting. As each member of the troupe stood up, applause immediately followed. Then, Bao Erhan gave a speech in response, concise and powerful, repeatedly emphasizing that the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the interior are one family, and that the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang sincerely support the central government and the leader. Yi Min gave a speech, stating roughly: Xinjiang was particularly inappropriate in the past, but since Zhang Zhizhong took charge of Xinjiang, everything has changed. The harmony and unity between the various ethnic groups is unprecedented. Mr. Zhang can be said to be a fair statesman, but unfortunately his goals have not yet been fully achieved. Mr. Yi finally put forward his hopes for the election aspect, and said that when the visiting troupe left Xinjiang, Xinjiang Secretary-General Ai Sha (former Legislative Committee member) had entrusted him to express his greetings to the President of the Legislative Yuan and all his colleagues. After the speeches, Xinjiang dancers Kangbala Khan and others performed impromptu performances, and the gathering dispersed happily around 3 o'clock.</p>

<h3>UN Committee Votes on Korean Issue, US Proposal Passes, Soviet Union Declares Refusal to Participate in Committee, China States Right to Speak on Measures for Troops Stationed in Korean Territory</h3>
<p>[News from our paper] Lake Success, May 5th (Radio Broadcast): The UN Political Committee today rejected the Soviet Union's proposal that US and Soviet troops withdraw from Korea before January 1st of next year, by a vote of twenty to six. After suffering this defeat, Soviet representative Gromyko immediately declared that he would not participate in the vote on the proposal by US Secretary of State Marshall to hold elections in Korea under UN supervision before March 1st of next year. This statement shows that the Soviet Union is unwilling to participate in the UN Committee established by the UN Political Committee last week, which is preparing to go to Korea. During today's vote, the countries that supported the Soviet proposal were only the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Egypt. The representative of Czechoslovakia was not present at the meeting when the vote was taken. Disregarding the opposition of the Soviet bloc, the UN Political Committee continued to vote on the US proposal, which passed with forty-six votes to zero. The countries of the Soviet bloc refused to vote, and even refused to abstain. The declaration of the Soviet bloc's boycott of the UN Committee was announced on the spot by the representative of Ukraine.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] The UN Political Committee today debated the Korean issue. The US-proposed amendment was opposed only by five countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Ukraine. They unanimously condemned this plan as "a smokescreen to cover up the US's transformation of Korea into a target of its expansionist policy," while the two major Asian countries, China and India, supported the US proposal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, West 5th] Our country today proposed that the measures for the withdrawal of occupying forces from Korea should be consulted and determined by the four major powers that signed the Moscow Agreement. This proposal was submitted by our country to the UN Political Committee this afternoon in the form of an amendment to the US draft resolution. The US draft resolution originally briefly prescribed a plan for rebuilding Korean independence with the assistance of the Korean Committee established in the United Nations. When submitting this amendment, our representative Gu Weijun explained that China should have the right to speak on the measures for the occupying forces stationed in Korea, or at least should receive sufficient information about these measures. This matter is very important because these measures may have important repercussions within the Chinese territory adjacent to Korea. Mr. Gu stated that about a week ago, in a statement, he explained that the Chinese people are very concerned about Korea obtaining true independence, because any events that occur in Korea in the future will have immediate repercussions on the northeastern provinces of China adjacent to Korea. Directly referring to the Soviet proposal on the immediate and simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea, Mr. Gu expressed doubts about the effectiveness of this proposal. He said, "We are deeply aware of the principles in the Soviet proposal, but we believe that the proposal is too simple. In this situation, we believe that the withdrawal of the occupying forces can only be implemented after the Korean people are truly able to rebuild their independence and create conditions for maintaining this independence." Subsequently, Mr. Gu cited evidence to support his views, stating that according to the information he had, there were 150,000 armed troops from North Korea, and these troops were all trained and equipped by the Soviet Union. On the other hand, it is heard that there are no comparable troops in South Korea. He continued, "If these North Korean troops are incorporated into the Korean national army with the consent of the South Korean people, China will have no objection. But if the South Korean people object, this will cause a serious situation, which will inevitably have repercussions on the adjacent Chinese territory." US representative Dulles asked whether the Chinese delegation would consider abandoning the amendment requiring the four major powers to consult each other before the withdrawal of the new occupying forces if China was part of the United Nations Korean Committee. Gu et al. stated that the duties and powers of the Korean Committee have not yet been formulated. However, he continued, the Chinese delegation will consider this matter, although any strict reply to this important question must naturally await consultation with the national government. Mr. Gu concluded by stating that, for these reasons, the Chinese delegation supports the US proposal on the conditions modified above.</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Views on Palestine Partition Plan Moving Closer, Britain Hopes the Soviet Union Can Provide Supplementary Explanations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 4th] The US and the Soviet Union have now reached a stage of coordination on the Palestine partition plan, as the US and the Soviet Union have held informal small-group meetings with Canada and Guatemala in an effort to eliminate major differences in the plans of both sides. After the secret meeting, US representative Johnson said that the small-group meeting had exchanged views between the two sides, and they were getting closer to each other.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 5th] British representative Martin stated in the Palestine Partition Sub-Committee that Britain hopes the Soviet Union can provide supplementary explanations before expressing its views on the Soviet proposal to implement the partition. Britain's position has been repeatedly explained in the past, so it does not intend to raise any questions at the current stage. According to the Soviet proposal, Britain should end the trusteeship of Palestine before January 1, 1948, and British troops should withdraw within three to four months after that date. At the same time, it advocates sending a Security Council committee to Palestine immediately to prepare for the establishment of temporary government committees for the Jewish and Arab states, and to elect constituent assemblies within six months to carry out the tasks of drafting constitutions and establishing formal governments.</p>
<h3>Soviet Bloc Urges Discussion of the Franco Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] Authorities today claimed that the Soviet bloc countries will recommend that the United Nations Security Council immediately discuss the issue of the Spanish Franco government threatening world peace, and demand that all countries sever diplomatic relations with Spain and implement economic sanctions.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Dismisses Hirano, All Parties Express Understanding, Katayama Claims Cabinet Strength Increased</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] All Japanese opposition parties are not making direct and forceful criticisms of the Hirano incident, as they still want to wait for the development of the split within the Socialist Party. The Liberal Party criticized Katayama for creating this bad precedent in Japanese political history. The Communist Party believes that during the parliamentary session, the Prime Minister should consult the Parliament before the appointment and removal of cabinet members. This implementation of the power of dismissal is inevitably suspected of being "dictatorial." Although most members of the House of Councillors acknowledge that Prime Minister Katayama's dismissal of Hirano was legal, they feel regret that he did not give careful consideration to the first use of this power stipulated by the new constitution. After Katayama attended the meeting on the 4th to explain the difficulties of using the power of dismissal, he seemed to have been understood. Katayama also made a guarantee that he would use the power of dismissal carefully in the future.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama stated that the issue of the successor to the Minister of Agriculture can be decided today. As for the candidates, Asanuma and Nomizo will be selected, with Asanuma being the most suitable. Katayama said: The disagreement of the cabinet's views was already expressed during the discussion of important bills such as the nationalization of coal mines, the law on eliminating the concentration of economic power, the law on adjusting agricultural production, and the supplementary budget bill. This reorganization is aimed at strengthening the cabinet's political power. In the future, the power of Nishio, Ashida, and their factions in the cabinet will be further consolidated. As for what relationship Hirano has with the conservative new party movement, it is not yet known. In short, due to the occurrence of this problem, the emergence of the conservative new party will be greatly affected. The cabinet will be more stable in the future.</p>

He said, "If you remain steadfast and get through the winter, then by next spring, the foundation for economic recovery can be laid." He said that the end of the destruction phase is when German factories and German Nazi ideology are completely eliminated.

President Truman sent a special telegram to Mr. Wei's family, advising them to restrain their grief. Mr. Wei's wife in Washington believes that the reason why Mr. Wei committed suicide was because he suffered from stomach cancer and was unable to continue his efforts for world peace, which affected his nerves and led to this outrage.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandit's Huge Supply Organization Uncovered, Materials Worth Tens of Billions Seized in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Qingdao, Communist Side Shocked, Hua Zhong Cadres Detained to Investigate Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The First Pacification Zone Command uncovered a shocking major case involving the Communist Bandit's general supply organization in Shanghai, which has been sparsely recorded in various newspapers in the city. However, in view of the large scale of the Communist Bandit's organization in Shanghai, with branches and sea transportation routes extending to Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, Ningbo, Dinghai, Zhapu, as well as Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau, the authorities in charge have maintained strict secrecy in order to catch all the bandits in one fell swoop. The details of the successful seizure have not yet been publicly announced. The Central News Agency reporter has now obtained the actual situation from reliable sources, as follows: Commander of the First Pacification Zone, General Li Mo'an, has repeatedly received reports from Director Jiang Jianmin of the Second Department that the Communist Bandit authorities in the Hua Zhong, Su Zhong, and Su Bei three military regions, as well as the Communist Bandit "Hua Zhong Political Bureau," "Su Wan Border Region Government Office in Shanghai," "Hua Zhong Bank Su Bei First Branch," "Hua Zhong Su Zhong Goods Administration," and "Cotton and Salt Management Committee" and other institutions have established a "Joint Office" in Shanghai to handle military supply and material dumping and purchasing matters. They have also established a "General Logistics Supply Station" in Hede Town Port, Sheyang River Estuary, Su Bei Bandit Area, listing all Communist Bandit official companies and firms in the Hua Zhong, Su Zhong, and Su Bei areas as branches of the station, and appointing Feng Changbo, the Communist Bandit financial tycoon and former General Manager of the Communist Bandit Profit Company, as the "Station Master" to be unified under the command of "Director of the Hua Zhong Goods Administration" and Communist Bandit logistics tycoon Yi Mou of "Su Bei Bank." Communist Bandit Yi himself secretly came to Shanghai in October last year to personally deploy.</p>
<p>Disguised Arrival in Shanghai for Deployment of Activities, Discovered and Secretly Investigated</p>
<p>According to senior Communist Bandit cadre Li, who has turned over a new leaf, and reports from anti-Communist comrades, Communist Bandit Yi, under the alias of Liu Ming, was a senior cadre of the Communist Bandit's logistics base station while working in southern Anhui. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was stationed in Shanghai by the authorities of the "New Fourth Army" in southern Anhui to rush to transport military supplies and supply the Communist Bandit side. After the victory, he withdrew to northern Jiangsu with the army, and successively held Communist Bandit positions such as Director of the Goods Administration, Bank Manager, and Party Affairs Commissioner. In July this year, the Communist Bandit was suddenly encountered in Shanghai's Gordon Road, Central Road, Yuanmingyuan Road, etc., which was very suspicious. After tracking and secretly investigating, it was learned that Communist Bandit Xin had come to Shanghai to represent the areas in northern Jiangsu to prepare for military supply institutions and transportation matters, and to establish an office in a certain place, dispatching a batch of Communist Bandit financial and cargo transportation cadres to Shanghai, mostly using unscrupulous merchants to organize companies and firms, using northern Jiangsu cotton, salt, grain, fur, etc. to come to Shanghai and other places for dumping, purchasing military supplies, with copper, iron, machinery, telecommunications equipment, medical supplies, cloth, and dyes being the main items, and foreign goods being the secondary items, and also engaging in black market buying and selling of gold US dollars, speculating on financial markets, hoarding commercial goods, purchasing foreign exchange, printing counterfeit currency, publications, books, and other illicit activities, on a large scale, with strong funding, etc. After receiving the report, Commander Li, in addition to strictly ordering the maritime and river defense forces to effectively arrest the Communist Bandits, also appointed Director Jiang to order the Communist Bandit rear work personnel and coastal intelligence team to continue the investigation, so as to uncover and smash their conspiracy.</p>
<h3>Interception of Motorized Junk on Chongming Island Waters</h3>
<p>Refusal to Allow Inspection Leads to Gun Confiscation and Discovery of Large Quantities of Cloth and Pigment</p>
<p>It was reported on October 18th by Yuan Guoxiang, Captain of the Tongru Qihai Fishermen's Joint Defense Brigade: On the 18th, while patrolling the waters off the outer reaches of Chongming Island, a motorized junk was intercepted. During the boarding inspection, the vessel suddenly opened fire, refusing inspection and attempting to flee. Fortunately, we outnumbered the bandits and surrounded them, confiscating over ten rifles, several short guns, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. Dozens of male and female bandits and crew members were captured. Upon inspection of their documents and correspondence, it was discovered that the ship was carrying over a thousand bolts of military uniform cloth and dozens of canisters of pigment, stated to be obtained by exchanging 500 bales of cotton in Shanghai, intended for dyeing this year's winter military uniforms. Under interrogation, the captured bandits confessed: these supplies were handed over by Shanghai bandits Jin Mou, Rong Mou, etc., for transport to Subei Hede Town to Feng Changbo of the He Yu Company, for distribution to Zhong Qiguang, Director of the Political Department of the East China Military Region Headquarters, He Ximing, Director of the Subei Office of the Suwan Border Region Government, and Chen Guodong, Director of the Subei Goods Management Bureau. General offices, company branches, and transportation firms are set up in Shanghai and other locations. The bandits from Shanghai have gone to Qingdao and then to Yantai to make arrangements in the "liberated" areas of East China, and other information.</p>
<p>Meticulous Planning and Agreed-Upon Steps</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, Director Jiang immediately drafted an investigation plan and reported it to Commander Li for review. Commander Li, considering the seriousness of the case, specially dispatched Major General Jiang Jianmin, Director of the Second Division, to Shanghai to oversee the investigation. As Shanghai was under the jurisdiction of the Songhu Garrison Area, Commander Yi Tiewu was requested by telegram to send personnel to assist. Upon receiving the telegram, Commander Xuan dispatched Director Tao Yishan of the Inspection Department to assist. Director Jiang also arrived in Shanghai on the 20th, met with Director Tao to discuss the matter, and jointly requested instructions from a certain general stationed in Shanghai by the Ministry of National Defense regarding the investigation steps. It was decided that the general would plan and supervise, Director Jiang would oversee the investigation, interrogation, and command, and Director Tao would provide personnel assistance. Under the meticulous planning and supervision of the general, action commenced on the 21st. Dozens of covert operatives and newly surrendered personnel under the general's command were mobilized. Director Jiang led Colonel Section Chief Ji Zhongpeng, Chen Anglin, Lieutenant Colonel Staff Officer Shao Yuanlai, and dozens of other officers, along with over ten local residents from Subei who had reported the crimes, and Captain Huang of the Direct Intelligence Team, and Captain Yuan of the Fishermen's Brigade with their elite officers and soldiers, totaling over a hundred, and distributed them in Shanghai, Ningbo, Chongming, Nantong, Haimen, Dinghai, and surrounding areas. Director Tao assigned Secretary Director Zhang Yangming, Inspector General Lu Peng, along with Captain Feng Zhongda of the Maritime Inspection Brigade, and group leaders Wu Hongyuan, Luo Jingfang, and others from the social investigation group, and over eighty personnel for action, investigation, surveillance, and management.</p>
<p>Raid in the Deep of Night, Rounding Up All at Once</p>
<p>To facilitate command, communication, and liaison, a temporary office was established at the Maritime Brigade of the Inspection Department, commencing operations on the 21st. The locations of the bandit organizations, companies, firms, and the faces of the key bandit criminals and bandit merchants were clearly investigated and identified. That very night, the order to take action was given. On the 22nd, the main supply organs, companies, branches, firms, offices, communication and liaison points, employee dormitories, and residences of the bandits in Shanghai were raided, and dozens of bandit cadres and merchants of all ranks were captured. Countless documents, account books, and receipts were seized, along with massive quantities of brass, pig iron, lead wire, gun stocks, ammunition, military equipment manufacturing parts and materials, various tools, medical and sanitary equipment, western medicines, gold, stocks, US dollars, flour, pine wood, fuel, leather hoses, pig bristles, motorized junks, pigments, cloth, etc., the value of which is incalculable.</p>
<p>Institutions in Various Locations Broken Up One After Another</p>
<p>Through individual interrogations and based on investigation reports, it was discovered that branch offices were set up in Qingdao, Ningbo, Dinghai, Yantai, Hong Kong, and other places. Task forces led by Group Leader Wu, Group Leader Zhang, Inspector Zheng, Staff Officer Cao, and Captain Huang were dispatched to Qingdao, Ningbo, and other locations to thoroughly dismantle the branch offices and bandit-run firms in each location. A group of bandit cadres and merchants were captured, and firearms, sewing machines, Western medicines, gold, wheat, flour, corn, books, and other items were seized. In total, the materials seized in Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places are estimated to be worth around 10 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Reporting the Investigation and Handing Over to Military Law for Trial</p>
<p>Personnel dispatched to various locations to break the case have successively returned to Shanghai to report on their missions. The investigation work has reached its conclusion. Currently, the process of organizing interrogation records, documents, evidence, property, and materials is underway. Director Jiang has reported the handling process to Commander Li for review.

<h3>Jiangjing Runs Aground, Passengers to Ningbo Safe</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route vessel "Jiangjing" set sail from the Jinliyuan wharf at 4 PM the day before yesterday and was scheduled to sail to Ningbo. At 5:30 PM, when about to exit Wusongkou, it encountered seven or eight sailboats, sailing into the port. At that time, the tide was rising rapidly, and the captain of the "Jiangjing" seeing this, immediately steered left to avoid them. The bow of the ship suddenly crashed into an underwater rocky outcrop, running aground on a shoal. Although the ship attempted to reverse, it was unable to escape due to the bow being wedged on the rocks and the shallow water. The captain sent a telegram to Shanghai to report the incident. That company dispatched a lighter that night to transport some of the passengers back to Shanghai. The "Jiangjing" had about 1,000 passengers in total, and all of them transferred to the "Jiangya" yesterday to go to Ningbo.

<h3>Qiantang River Flood Disaster Alleviated</h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou] Last August, Mao Yisheng led the Qiantang River Seawall Project Inspection Team. After inspecting the entire seawall, he said to the accompanying reporters, "The first step in controlling the Qiantang River is to make the river flow straight." Now, the Seawall Project Bureau has been established for more than a year. During this time, Wang Huzhen, the deputy director and chief engineer stationed in the bureau, has worked very hard. When he first took over the seawall project, it was like being besieged, with losses occurring in the east, and then losses in the west after emergency repairs. Despite complaints, they didn't give up on their tireless travels on the seawall day and night. They finally managed to keep the seawater more than seven miles away.</p>
<p>Sand Accretion on the South Bank First, their engineers discovered a sandy accretion shaped like an olive in the Qiantang River, from Xiaojian Mountain to Haining. This sandbar divided the river flow into two, causing the tidal waves to be more turbulent and surging. This sandbar was formed during the occupation period, and no one paid attention to the seawall at that time, so it collapsed year by year, becoming unmanageable by the 33rd and 34th years of the Republic. In the 25th year of the Republic, the only way to defend against the flood was to use wooden dikes everywhere for emergency repairs, but that was not a fundamental solution. So, twelve water diversion dams were built in Chenwengang, the area with the most severe collapse. These twelve water diversion dikes were like injecting twelve powerful injections. The water flow gradually stabilized, and the sandy accretion in Haining expanded straight to Qiaosi in Hangzhou due to the water diversion dams, reducing the severity of the seawall collapse. On the other hand, because the Qiantang River's flow was divided into two, the south bank was eroded at Nansha, and the riverbank collapse became increasingly severe. In fact, Nansha was also formed by accretion, with the seawall far behind Nansha. At the people's request, Nansha was urgently rescued, and water diversion dikes were made of unworked stones. Now, the riverbank is no longer collapsing, and sand has even started to accrete.</p>
<p>Wooden Dikes on the South Bank In the north bank, from Xiaojian Mountain to Qiaosi in Hangzhou, the sand has formed a continuous line. The water near the seawall is also gradually silting up. On the south bank, new sand has also accreted in front of Nansha. The new sand accreted on the north and south banks is each five or six li wide, thus directing the water of the Qiantang River into the middle of the sand accreted on both sides. The Qiantang River is flowing straight.</p>
<p>Regarding the collapse of the Sibao Seawall, the entire stone seawall on the north bank was only lacking from Fort One to Fort Seven, which were built with stone strips. Because the construction of the seawall coincided with the Taiping Rebellion, Zuo Zongtang used wooden dikes to replace them during the Tongzhi reign to repair the seawall. After many years, the wooden dikes naturally collapsed. Now, the Seawall Project Bureau is working hard to use wooden piles and sheathing to defend against the collapse and using water diversion dams to silt up new sand. When we passed by, Deputy Director Wang invited us to see the wooden branches exposed by the tidal waves, which were still clearly distinguishable.</p>
<p>Building water diversion dams The only current problem is how to preserve the accreted sand to protect the stone seawall and make the Qiantang River flow straight permanently. Therefore, it is necessary to build water diversion walls on the sand or even to the appropriate place outside the sand. We went to Chenwengang and saw many Chinese and foreign technicians working hard on this task.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Wang told reporters: "Originally, new accreted sand after building a water diversion dam had to accrete once a year, but because the Qiantang River has two tides every day, the sand accretion is faster. This is truly 'Heaven fulfilling human wishes.' Now, we must protect against collapse on one hand and repair the dilapidated stone seawalls on the other."</p>
<p>Jue-Numbered Seawall We then went to the most dangerous Jue-numbered seawall and saw that it had been repaired into a very good concrete seawall. This large block of concrete bedrock was made in the first year of the Republic. It was originally intended to be used to repair the seawall, but local people opposed it because they considered it "foreign goods." It was not until the 36th year of the Republic that the Seawall Project Bureau used it. We also went to Xiaojian Mountain, where the stone was quarried. Various newspapers in the past, such as those in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing, have recorded plans to destroy the Shizi Men with guns. (The Shizi Men they were referring to was probably Xiaojian Mountain. In fact, the Shizi Men is between Kanshan and Gaoshan, close to the south bank.) They said that destroying the Shizi Men would allow navigation and prevent tidal flooding. Now, engineering experts have proven that this is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>At Xiaojian Mountain, they said, "We are only removing a surface layer by blasting the mountain like this. How can we blast it completely? Moreover, Xiaojian Mountain has nothing to do with tidal flooding and navigation."</p>
<p>Xiaojian Mountain was originally a desolate place, but now hundreds of technicians and workers are working there. There is a 15-kilowatt generator, an air compressor, and compressed air hammers and drills to drill the mountain. After drilling, gunpowder is injected and ignited to explode into large blocks of stone. After the large stones are blasted out, small locomotives (called Pony engines, equivalent to a Ford horsepower) pull dozens of bucketloads of stone to the stone crushing machine, pour it in to be crushed into small pieces, pour it back into iron buckets, and transport it to Chenwengang on a small light railway to make water diversion dams.</p>
<p>No Worries About Floods We were very happy to learn that there is no need to worry about the Qiantang River floods and further wanted to know how to use the Qiantang River to prosper our land. On the way back to Hangzhou, I talked to Deputy Director Wang about the issue of Qiantang River navigation. They estimated that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway transports about 1,500 tons of cargo per day, and other local goods and timber transported by various means account for about 3,000 tons. If Qiantang River shipping accounts for 1,000 tons, it can support three 300-ton ships and two 500-ton ships. Now that the Qiantang River is flowing straight, the riverbed has not yet been determined, and the depth is unknown. Therefore, surveying is needed, markers are needed, and more water diversion dams are needed to fix the riverbed. According to their plan, a wharf is planned to be built in Sibao, but a railway connection to the train station is required to facilitate transportation. The funds needed for such procedures and engineering, calculated before the war, would be 10 million yuan, equivalent to 5 million US dollars. Such a project needs to be completed within five years. To ensure the prosperity and safety of Jiangnan, the reporter believes that there can be no further delay. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Inscribes "Lakes and Mountains Enhanced"</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng Donates 2 Billion to Rebuild Leifeng Pagoda</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Hangzhou on the 5th] "Leifeng Evening Glow," one of the ten scenic spots of Hangzhou's West Lake, has been a mere name since Sun Chuanfang entered Zhejiang and the pagoda collapsed. It is now known that Mr. Du Yuesheng has initiated the rebuilding of Leifeng Pagoda, donating 2 billion yuan. A "Leifeng Pagoda Reconstruction Committee" has been established in Shanghai to raise another 3 billion. The area inscribed with "Lakes and Mountains Enhanced" by Chairman Chiang has been completed first.</p>
<h3>The Great Legacy of Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Taipei on the 2nd] The most valuable aspect of Taiwan Province is the legacy received after the recovery, left by the Japanese after fifty years of hard work. Minister Bai and President Zhang, who recently visited Taiwan, have both clearly pointed out that the recovery in Taiwan Province was the most effective and the most rapid. But what are the exact numbers, and what was the process of receiving such a large legacy? People are eagerly hoping to understand. The concluded Japanese Assets Processing Committee will provide a 100,000-word report: a beautiful booklet.</p>
<p>The total "book value" of houses, land, ships, vehicles, forests, machinery, furniture, and cash is 15,665,351,808.37 Taiwan dollars, including public property, private property, and business property. However, the quantity and value are calculated according to the lists of received items, and those not included were omitted, and some numbers, especially those received by military agencies, are not included.</p>
<p>The Japanese Assets Processing Committee, led by Yan Jiaju and He Xiaoyi with 200 staff members, began receiving work in January of the 35th year of the Republic and ended at the end of April this year. This organization cleanly completed the most basic work of recovering Taiwan and recorded the history of Japanese colonial exploitation in Taiwan over the past fifty years in numbers.</p>
<p>The Japanese Assets Processing Committee handed over the received items to the provincial government, which was then handled by the relevant departments of the provincial government. The provincial government requested that the assets originally from Taiwan Province be returned to the provincial government for handling. President Zhang has given his principal agreement to this principle, but it still needs technical research before a decision is made.</p>
<p>The numerical value of the assets at the time of acceptance is already considerable. If calculated at the current price index, it is indeed a very large legacy. We should cherish this number and use it well.</p>

<h3>Fifteen-Year-Old Child Bandit Arrested in Jiangyin</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Jiangyin on the 4th] Remnant bandits are lurking in the western border of Jingjiang, hoping to cross south. At the end of last month, they were jointly shelled by the coastal artillery of the fortress and warships in the river. Many signal flares were discovered in Shengang, Zhigang, and Ligang in the western countryside. The military has been conducting strict inspections for days. On the afternoon of the 3rd, a fifteen-year-old child wearing a military uniform was found in the north outskirts. Wearing the symbol of the Combined Logistics Headquarters, he admitted that he was a child soldier from the bandit side, coming to Yin to scout out military intelligence. There were a total of five people in the urban area. He was immediately sent to the fortress headquarters for interrogation. Because it is still necessary to investigate his accomplices, his name will not be announced for the time being. Also: On the 27th bridge from Tangtouqiao Station on the Xicheng Road, at about 3 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, three bandits carrying kerosene barrels set fire to the bridge. Fortunately, Shen Amao, a villager digging river mud downstream, saw it and shouted for help. The bandits immediately fled west.</p>
<h3>Fengxian District Court to Be Established on Schedule</h3>

<h3>Solving the Four Difficulties of Chinese Characters and Eliminating Illiteracy in Fujian Province - Institute Director Huang Juemin Implements New Literacy Technology</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper in Fuzhou on the 4th] Huang Juemin, the Director of the Fujian Provincial Research Institute, has been devoted to the work of Chinese character reform for many years and has now achieved preliminary results. According to Mr. Huang, people generally lament the four difficulties of Chinese characters (difficult to read, difficult to recognize, difficult to write, difficult to look up), but these are technical problems that can actually be overcome. Chinese characters have fewer characters than English characters. According to the Kangxi Dictionary, which has the most characters listed in existing dictionaries, the number is more than 51,000 characters. The Cihai has more than 13,000 characters, the Ciyuan has 12,000 characters, and Zhu Yunwu's Small Dictionary has more than 6,000 characters, while the number of characters generally used is only about 5,000. However, due to unreasonable literacy technology, the current literacy standard in our country is: about 1,300 characters for elementary school graduates, 1,800 characters for middle school students, and 4,500 characters for university students, which is shockingly different from the standard of more than 5,000 characters that children in European and American countries can recognize by the age of ten. According to Mr. Huang's research results, as long as one recognizes the 4,000 characters that are most needed for daily use, one can understand 99.8% of general reading materials. If combined with reasonable teaching methods, fourth-grade elementary school students can fully recognize and write documents. He is currently negotiating with the Fujian Provincial Department of Education to implement pilot programs, which are expected to greatly help eliminate illiteracy.

<h3>The Silk Merchants Association Held a General Meeting Yesterday to Discuss How to Maintain Business and Resolved to Send Ten Representatives to Petition the Authorities</h3>
<p>The local Silk Merchants Association held its second general meeting of members at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 300 member representatives attended, and representatives from the Social Bureau and the City Chamber of Commerce were also present to provide guidance. First, Chairman Tang Zhiliang reported on the association's work and the situation of the industry. Subsequently, proposals were discussed. The association stated that since the government implemented the cotton yarn control policy, its members' businesses have encountered difficulties that have become increasingly serious. Recently, the Textile Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated the "Implementation Plan for Adjusting the Supply and Demand of Commercial Yarn and Cloth for the Development of the Textile Industry." The joint cotton yarn allocation method and the licensing and distribution system do not directly allocate yarn to silk merchants. This will inevitably lead to a crisis of nominal existence but actual demise. Therefore, it was proposed to request the government to protect the industry's business. After discussion, it was resolved that five representatives each from the general meeting and the board of directors would be sent to the relevant agencies to petition. A petition was submitted to the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Municipal Government, the Textile Adjustment Committee, the National Yarn Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the industry's legal and legitimate business be maintained after the implementation of the joint cotton yarn allocation, and that the industry's cotton yarn inventory be legally regulated. A letter was also sent to the National Silk Merchants Association to respond. During the discussion of the temporary proposal, it was decided that in order to avoid suspicion when selling cotton yarn to complex businesses, the industry should unanimously refuse to make purchases. The 45-day limit for cotton yarn inventory regulation should be reformed by the authorities; otherwise, cotton yarn below 10 counts and above 60 counts should be exempted from restrictions. It was also proposed to establish a silk merchants' fellowship, and a request was submitted to the Social Bureau for approval. The general meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales are Stagnant, and People's Hearts are Floating, Leading to a Uniform Decline in Japonica and Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Oil Cakes from Miscellaneous Grains Fell More Than They Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of 10,100+ shih of rice. Digestion was weak, and people's hearts were floating. The market situation took a sharp turn for the worse. Japonica rice fell by 20,000-30,000 yuan, and Indica rice also fell by more than 10,000 yuan. White rice fell by 20,000 yuan, and early thin rice fell sharply by 30,000-40,000 yuan. The North market recovered slightly at the close, but the South market remained sluggish. Flour from Wuxi continued to flood the market, coupled with the influx of miscellaneous brands, resulting in stagnant sales and a sharp drop of 6,000-7,000 yuan. Bran sales were sluggish, and actual sales were cold, resulting in a sharp drop of 5,000-6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The demand for soybean cakes from the Hakka traders was flat, resulting in a further drop of 2,000-3,000 yuan. Soybeans remained lackluster, weak and stagnant. Oil mills were very sluggish, with very few local transactions and very few Hakka traders, resulting in a further drop of more than 10,000 yuan. Kidney beans from Shantou weakened, falling back by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Red beans from the Guangdong traders were stagnant, gradually falling by 20,000 yuan. Broad bean sales remained thin, weak and sluggish, gradually falling by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed suit, falling by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Corn from the Northern traders was cold, with little demand, falling back by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had balanced arrivals and sales, remaining mediocre. Sesame oil mills were selling short and making small purchases, with very little demand throughout the market, resulting in a further drop of 10,000-20,000 yuan. Yuan wheat also followed suit, falling by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Wheat sales were stagnant and lacked transactions, also falling by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market was mixed. Raw oil was strong, while soybean oil remained weak. Clear oil rose by 10,000-20,000 yuan, raw vegetable oil rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan, cooked vegetable oil was flat, and sesame oil from Hankou remained abundant, resulting in a further drop of 20,000-30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Ratio of Raw Cotton to Rice Prices Has Increased Compared to Before</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Pricing Subcommittee of the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs discussed and decided on the method of purchasing raw cotton. It was tentatively determined that one shih of seven-eighths-inch fine velvet white cotton should be equivalent to four shih of local rice or seven shih of wheat for reference. The local pricing committee should still refer to the local supply and transportation to determine the purchase price, and it is not a rigid regulation. According to old customs, three shih of rice were commonly exchanged for one shih of cotton. This time, the committee specially increased the ratio to protect cotton farmers and encourage production.</p>
<h3>Second Estimate of Cotton Production</h3>
<p>The second estimate of cotton production is based on the cotton situation before mid-October in the fifteen provinces and cities of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Liaoning, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Tianjin.</p>
<p>The national cotton field area is 38,528,000 mu, a decrease of 545,000 mu from the previous estimate; the seed cotton production is 10,563,000 dan, a decrease of 528,000 dan from the previous estimate.</p>
<p>The national cotton situation this year is generally good, with few pests and diseases. Spring droughts and autumn floods are relatively common. The water disaster in the Subei Xuhai area is quite serious. However, the disaster of soldiers and bandits is everywhere, and only Hunan, Zhejiang, and Sichuan are fortunate to be spared. If the war is quelled and cotton farmers can live and work in peace, the increase in cotton fields will be considerable.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Rose Slightly</h3>
<p>Public bonds rebounded yesterday. Unified C opened at 19,400 yuan and rose from 19,300 yuan to 22,200 yuan before leveling off slightly. Room 503 and Room 552 bought in, while Room 614 and Room 555 all sold out. As a result, A and B bonds rose by 1,800 yuan compared to the previous closing, Unified C rose by 2,500 yuan, and D and E bonds each rose by 2,000 yuan. The turnover was approximately 7 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also turned stable yesterday. Ewo Silk opened highest at 184,000 yuan, reached a high price of 188,500 yuan, and finally struggled at 185,000 yuan. The note securities group had supply, while the Guangdong traders and foreign firm group sold. The Hong Kong Shanghai telegram contracted, and there was news of shipping companies selling ships. People's hearts were still good, and the trend was very stable. As a result, Ewo Telephone and Cultivation were flat compared to the previous close. Ewo Silk, British Allied, Hui De, Dou Ye, Guangdong Paper, Shipping, and Steel all rose slightly.</p>
<p>Guangdong traders absorbed Yong Silk for immediate delivery again yesterday in the market. The situation of receiving goods outside the market was good. There was a slight rebound in the middle, but because people's hearts were scattered, many large households in the industry closed their positions, and the stock fell again after stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Many Large Households Still Closed Their Positions, and Chinese Stocks Were Initially Stable But Then Fell</h3>
<p>Initially, because Yong Silk for immediate delivery opened at 275 yuan and Shanghai delivery opened at 277 yuan, there were immediate delivery closures, with supply and sales being delivered, forcing the price down to a low of 265 yuan for immediate delivery and 267 yuan for delivery. Yong Gong was lowered to the limit down. Liang Guang and Shanli purchased Yong Silk for cash, and those receiving goods outside the market were extremely active. The interest rate was slightly lower, at 1 jiao 8 and 2 jiao 2 and a half fen, and gradually rose to a high price of 276 yuan for immediate delivery and 277 yuan for delivery. After the buying interest of the Guangdong traders stopped slightly, there were sales at high prices, and there was a slight decline. Although there was a recovery afterwards, it was difficult to break through the opening line in the morning. At the close, there was a sudden large sell-off outside the market. Hengshu quickly sold to cash out. The noon close for Yong Silk for both cash and delivery was 29 yuan. Except for Zhongfang and Yaxing, which rose by half a percentage point in the midst of sluggish turnover, Wuhe continued to fall by 10 percent, and Yong Gong fell to the limit down again. Except for Zhabei New Asia Underwear, which rose slightly, and Hengfeng, which was flat, immediate delivery stocks all fell slightly. Delivery stocks included Qinxing, which fell by half a percentage point, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, only immediate delivery was done. Yong Silk was forced down to a low price of 264 yuan due to the news that the overnight report said that the US loans to China would be advanced, but the number of loans was negligible. Guangdong traders and small financial shops helped to absorb at low prices and recovered to 271 yuan. However, large households, such as Ye, closed their positions outside the market, and Wang sold in the market. The state bank's exchange difference was also unable to support the price. It became weak again before the close. However, there were also many who maintained at low prices and turned to consolidate. The three small hot stocks all worked hard themselves and showed stability. As a result, compared to the last close, Yong Silk, Xinhe, and Lilian in immediate delivery stocks fell slightly. Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, Zhonghai, Huaxin, and Zhongsheng rose slightly. Zhabei America saw stability. Old Huashang and Da Sanze recovered slightly.</p>
<p>The stock exchange will be closed for one day on November 12th, the birthday of Sun Yat-sen. The 53rd term of delivery will be done until the 10th.</p>
<p>Money Market Eases</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The money market, which was tight in recent days, suddenly eased yesterday. The overnight interest rate fell to 1 jiao 7-8 fen, the interest rate for long and short positions in Chinese stocks was 2 jiao 3, and cash also gradually became abundant because the pay period had passed. Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus had an exchange difference of 26.8 billion yuan, the large exchange bank had an exchange difference of 40.3 billion yuan, the foreign merchant bank had 13.6 billion yuan, the small exchange bank had an exchange difference of 27.1 billion yuan, the Bank of China had an exchange difference of 11.1 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had an exchange difference of 13.2 billion yuan, the Agricultural Bank of China had an exchange difference of 8.1 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau had an exchange difference of 32.7 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau had an exchange difference of 2.7 billion yuan, and the Cooperative Bank had an exchange difference of 100 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Promotion Office for Export Visa Measures is Under Study</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] When the Import and Export Management Committee was ordered to merge and establish on August 19th of this year, it was stipulated that export visa matters would be handled by the Export Promotion Office. However, since the visa methods and implementation procedures were still under study, they were not implemented for some time. Exporters still went through customs clearance and release after foreign exchange settlement by designated banks as in the past. It is now heard that the visa procedures are being drafted by the Export Promotion Office in conjunction with relevant parties, and will be announced and implemented once preparations are complete. It is reported that the significance of implementing this method is to provide the authorities with accurate and clear overall information as soon as possible, and to prevent the export price from being reported too low. The handling procedures will strive to be simple and fast, and will not deliberately create difficulties or delay the shipment of export goods. However, it is heard that exporters have expressed opposition to the export visa method, believing that it will only increase trouble and easily lead to abuses, which is harmful and not beneficial to export trade.</p>
<h3>The Deadline for Registration of Manufacturers for the Distribution of Yarn and Cloth by the Textile Construction Company Has Passed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The deadline for the registration of manufacturers for the distribution of yarn and cloth by the Textile Construction Company was originally set for February 15th of this year. However, due to requests from various parties, it was reopened in June. As of now, more than 200 manufacturers have registered. It is now heard that the company authorities believe that the source of cotton yarn is difficult, the number of new registrations is large, and there is not enough to distribute. Therefore, they have to restrict it appropriately. Therefore, it has been decided that only those who started production before the end of May of this year and have been in production for more than one month with supporting documents will be approved, and those after June will be processed later. The company has closed new registration applications on the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>The Textile Adjustment Committee Discusses Labor Costs</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a regular committee meeting at 4:00 PM today to discuss the issue of labor costs for spinning. The issue of joint distribution of cotton yarn with certificates will be discussed after the National Economic Commission makes a decision and will not be discussed for the time being. It is heard that General Chen Cheng, the Director of the Northeast Headquarters, in view of the lack of yarn and cloth in the Northeast, has specially dispatched Yang Chuoan, the Chairman of the Materials Adjustment Committee of the Headquarters, to Shanghai to ask the Textile Adjustment Committee to find a way to allocate 3,000 pieces of yarn and tens of thousands of bolts of cotton cloth to the Northeast to meet urgent needs. This matter will also be discussed at today's meeting.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Initially Weakened But Then Strengthened</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market weakened at the beginning and then strengthened yesterday. No. 120 Asahi A-grade bright silk opened at 74 million yuan. The midday close rose to 5 million yuan again. In the afternoon, various parties frequently had purchasing interest, so it was raised by another 2 million yuan, and the final price was 75 million yuan. 4A goods were quoted at 63 million yuan, all up 2 million yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The factory-managed market remained quiet. The market situation continued to weaken yesterday. All grades of student goods were inactive. D-grade was quoted at 63 million yuan, down 500,000 to 1 million yuan from the previous day. The negotiated price for Hiranoshi goods was around 61.5 to 6.2 million yuan, also down 500,000 yuan from the previous day. The decline in ordinary Hiranoshi goods was the largest, while the asking price for Tokujo Hiranoshi goods remained firm.</p>
<p>The price of silk goods was slightly firm yesterday, up 200,000 yuan from the previous day. Dachang and Huaqiang goods opened at 24.45 million yuan, and buying interest was strong, so it rose gradually. The spot price at the close was 600,000 yuan, and the forward date was 750,000 yuan. The price of plaid crepe did not move, but the turnover was very low. All other goods were stable yesterday.</p>
<p>The Sugar Market Was Unstable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market slightly recovered due to rumors that the allocation price would be adjusted. The guild's quoted price for No. 24 coarse white small bags was 928,000 yuan, 6 bags were 945,000 yuan, No. 20 medium sand white was 880,000 yuan, and Taiwan red was 945,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the allocation price was rumored to be unchanged, and the market showed a loosening trend again. Shantou green was 720,000 to 718,000 yuan, Xinghua white was 915,000 to 910,000 yuan, Xing red was 800,000 to 789,000 yuan, Diaogreen was 730,000 yuan, and the second grade was slightly lower by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Hainan red was 750,000 to 760,000 yuan. The total turnover was several thousand pieces.</p>
<p>"[Report from this newspaper]" The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chen Wheel arrived in port yesterday morning from Kaohsiung, carrying 8,000 tons of sugar, totaling 102,000 bags. It is now docked at the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>Overbought Positions Were Mostly Liquidated, and Selling Pressure Eased. Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Stopped Falling and Rebounded</h3>
<p>No. 42 Blue Phoenix Rose by 1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation was mediocre at the beginning of yesterday's trading. Afterwards, due to the excessive decline caused by the Japanese invasion, overbought positions were mostly liquidated. There were not many sellers in the market. Moreover, with the easing of the money market, various retail investors and dyeing and weaving factories saw low prices and absorbed them. Therefore, the market price of No. 42 Blue Phoenix fine yarn finally rebounded by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 33.3 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 300,000 to 800,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, the morning opening saw a large number of liquidations of overbought positions on the table, and asking prices fell. However, at 10:30 AM, due to the easing of the money market, the industry took action to buy, and the market rebounded after falling. However, the Hakka traders remained inactive, so as a result, 12-pound fine cloth only rebounded by 13,000 to 5,000 yuan for the top three or four grades. The price of Four Gentlemen Poplin fell by 50,000 yuan because the Textile Construction Company's supply and sales were very smooth, and people in the industry were less inclined to buy. The prices of other cloths rose and fell in turn.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Turned Prosperous. The spot cotton market situation was stable yesterday. Yarn mills' buying interest turned healthy. Sellers, due to the urgency of the money market, were eager to sell, and prices softened instead. Yarn mills also absorbed at low prices, so transactions turned prosperous. The total turnover for the day was 3,100 bales, and the factory turnover was 2,800 bales. The stack exchange price turnover was 300 bales. The opening prices for each grade were 4.01 million for Middling, 4.01 million for Texas, 2.563 million for Haiti Tip, 3.55 million for Shashi, 3.7 million for Lingshi, 3.37 million for Liukou fine velvet, and 4.01 million for Uruguay. The stack exchange prices were 3.6 million for Lingshi, 3.373 million for Chongsha, 2.5 million for Huoji, and 600,000 for Jupu seed cotton.</p>
<h3>China Flying Wheel Thread Factory's Share Subscription Successfully Completed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Our country's thread manufacturing industry was dominated by foreign goods 20 years ago, which greatly affected the national economy. In the spring of 1929, Mr. Luo Liqun invested solely to establish the "China Flying Wheel Thread Factory," and its "Flying Wheel" wood yarn balls began to compete with foreign goods. After operating with difficulty for many years, it was recently reorganized into a joint-stock limited company. The prescribed capital is 24 billion yuan, 20% of which is publicly solicited.

<h3>Tea Market's Actual Sales Are Not Declining</h3>
<p>Various types of domestic tea that have been active for a long time continued to maintain their popularity on the market yesterday due to continued appetite absorption in this area and other places. In the foreign-traded tea market, the large traders of Wuyuan, Tunxi, and Suian, etc., after discussing a batch with the French firm Yongxing the other day, although the firm still has purchasing interest at the moment, the sellers, in view of the lack of inventory in the market, have continued to develop the idea of firm sales, and transactions have turned inferior again. The prices are harder than before. As for Qimen black tea, the market remained calm due to the lack of compromise in the intake and output.</p>

<h3>Land Economics</h3>
<p>— Yang Wu</p>
<p>Zhang Pijie, Introduction to Land Economics, published by Zhonghua Book Company, priced at 3.5 yuan, one of the Social Science Series of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center</p>
<p>Among the various social sciences, land economics is one of the last to be established. Moreover, the academic circles in our country have paid attention to this science later than those in Europe and America. Therefore, there are particularly few works on this topic. Before the war, there was only one book on land economics published in Chinese, which was a translation of Land Economics by the American Richard T. Ely. Another book was a translation of Land Economics Theory by the Japanese Tsuguro Kawada. The former focused on American-style land use, while the latter discussed land rent, land price, and land area in more detail. Each book has its own focus, and neither of them is a research work by Chinese people with China's land problems as the object. This is not only a shortcoming in our country's social sciences, but also a weakness that must be remedied for our country, where land problems are very serious and land reform is urgently needed. In this book, Introduction to Land Economics, which is just over 100,000 words, we can clearly see the author's efforts on this point, and it proves that his efforts have indeed yielded considerable results.</p>
<p>According to the author's preface, the original plan was to have 15 chapters, about 150,000 words. In addition to the existing 10 chapters, there are also chapters on land price (upper and lower), land rights (upper and lower), and land finance. There are only 10 chapters in the book, and the remaining 5 chapters have not been added to the re-edition this year, which is a pity. This situation is exactly a common problem in our country's writing circles: there is an upper volume but no lower volume, there is a preface but no postscript, there is an upper volume but no lower volume, which often stops many more promising studies halfway. This book is also inevitable, so it is not enough to criticize deeply, but this phenomenon is really a sad situation for the progress of our country's academics.</p>
<p>In addition to the general narrative, each chapter of the book expresses the author's unique insights into land economics. The first chapter, Introduction, points out that the research object of this science is "the relationship between people and land, people and people, and land and land that arise due to human economic behavior," and determines its nature as "empirical science, human science, and social science," and especially emphasizes the distinction between laws and trends to strengthen the social science nature of land economics. This chapter's discussion of research methods is generally quite satisfactory. The second chapter, Definition, Classification, and Characteristics of Land, is nothing special, but the land definition item can show the author's attention to this issue and his humble attitude. But the third chapter, Land and Population, is even more brilliant. There is a series of novel insights here, such as the relationship between people's dependence on land, the carrying capacity of land for people, and finally the two principles of countermeasures for our country's land and population problems. This section can be used as a reference for our country's population policy:</p>
<p>"First, if the land's carrying capacity cannot be significantly expanded, and the total population of our country is not less than that of any country in the world, we should no longer adopt a positive population increase policy, but should pay attention to improving the living standards of the people and improving the physical quality of the people, so as to replace the planned population policy with blind policies.</p>
<p>"Second, before the quality of the population is significantly improved and the quantity does not change greatly, we should actively expand the land's carrying capacity for the population. The conditions are as follows:</p>
<p>Adopt scientific and technological techniques to increase the planting index and expand the space base of the national economy, especially agricultural production;</p>
<p>Promote the industrialization policy, absorb a large amount of labor from the agricultural sector as much as possible, so as to reduce the pressure of the agricultural population on the land, which is a prerequisite for improving agricultural production;</p>
<p>Agricultural production should be changed from one-sided labor-intensive and manual operation to capital-intensive and scientific, rationalized, and light operation, so as to increase the agricultural capacity for population;</p>
<p>Domestic transplantation and foreign transplantation should be carried out simultaneously to thin out the population of the country and at the same time increase the space on which the people rely to survive." (Page 36)</p>
<p>Chapter 4, On Land Use, Chapter 5, On Agricultural Land, Chapter 6, On Urban Land, and Chapter 7, On Rich Resource Land, the contents of these four chapters are closely related, equivalent to a divided writing of one chapter. The central discussion object is completely focused on the power of land use. After careful research, the historical development of land use has advanced along the following four major trends: the trend of expanding the area of land use, the trend of intensifying the degree of land use, the trend of complicating the content of land use, and the trend of socializing the nature of land use. The establishment and recognition of this trend is the author's most successful achievement in land use theory.</p>
<p>Chapters 8, 9, and 10 are the upper, middle, and lower articles on land rent. According to the author's preface, "they occupy the most space. The materials and arguments in these three chapters are mostly taken from Land Rent, Volume 4 of Theoretical National Economics, written by my teacher Mr. Thiel, and other works he has written on land rent." According to him, Thiel was one of the most influential economists on the European continent who recently passed away, and his thought was the famous "Social Legal System School." The extent to which the author of this book was influenced by Thiel is not obvious in this book; on the contrary, in the discussion of land rent on taxation of land rent, it can be seen that he has a unique insight into this issue. The author declares his position, and in principle still supports the land rent tax policy and equal land rights, but in theory, he repeatedly points out that this policy and the taxation of land rent without labor cannot be as simple as imagined. That is, the result of implementing the taxation of land rent cannot "be taxed 100% without discount." It is possible that it will be less than enough or too much.</p>
<p>Judging from the theory and research attitude of the entire book, the author's characteristics are cautious and faithful, and his unique insights are also very obvious. It is quite suitable as a reference for beginners and a reference for studying land economics. However, what makes readers regret the most is that the whole book is incomplete, the whole picture is difficult to see, and it is only an introduction. There are still too few explanations and elaborations.</p>
<h3>Gandhi and Stalin</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>The leftist journalist Louis Fischer once stood at the crossroads of the world, looking up at what he thought were two stars—Gandhi and Stalin; in reality, he was walking the path of Stalin. He lived in the Soviet Union for fourteen years and had a group of children there. He wrote many dispatches praising Stalin for the "Nation" newspaper in Manhattan. However, by 1938, he could no longer tolerate the dictatorial style of communism and resolutely left the Soviet Union. His wife and children did not come out until later, with the help of Mrs. Roosevelt, they returned to the United States. In 1941, in his book "Men and Politics," he praised democracy and freedom, and exposed the secrets behind the Iron Curtain. Therefore, the publication of his "Gandhi and Stalin" is logical. Fischer admired Gandhi, praising Gandhi's "integration of the hesitations of the idealist and the impatience of the revolutionary into a non-violent revolution." Like Gandhi, he advocated "transforming people before transforming the system." However, Gandhi did not accept his suggestion to take action against Western countries many years ago. The little old man said, "How can I ask Westerners to adopt a non-violent policy before I persuade the impatience of the Indians?" Gandhi's down-to-earth approach made the author even more respectful.</p>
<p>After the author leaned towards Gandhi, he sharply criticized Stalin. In the book, he said, "Political warfare is clear and complex; the daily newspaper is the war report in this war... Undoubtedly, we hope to wage 90% of our political warfare against the Soviet Union, but they are unwilling to use this method... Therefore, the fundamental problems between the United States and the Soviet Union, or between dictatorship and democracy, cannot be solved by diplomatic means... The struggle between these two major forces will never end unless one side wins completely." However, Fischer believed that "Stalin does not need a third world war or a world violent revolution. His strategy is to maintain his rule and expand his sphere of influence as much as possible by using nerve warfare to confront Western countries." But according to the author, the Soviet Union can support a ten-year war.</p>
<p>To avoid this new crisis, the author suggested forming a new United Nations outside the Soviet Union, "abolishing the veto power because this veto power has been used by the Soviet Union to alienate the democratic countries. This new United Nations is not like an international government, but a whole." This is only passive, and this alone cannot save democracy and peace. The author believes that the active aspect requires a great price.</p>
<p>In this way, Fischer believes that capitalism cannot counter communism. He believes that a system similar to socialism with a "planned economy" can compete. He imagined, "State-owned capital and private capital can compete freely... If the British Labour Party fails, the future of the democratic world is very bad," "Farmland is like air, free for people to cultivate, without buying or selling, people's economies are equal... Marxism and Gandhism are mixed to benefit every people." This may be his illusion, just as he once imagined Stalin and Gandhi cooperating. (Louis Fischer's recent book "Gandhi and Stalin," a book review published in the October 6th issue of Time Magazine, translated to readers.)</p>
<h3>New English Dictionary</h3>
<p>— Tong Fang</p>
<p>Compiled by Ge Chuanzhu, Gui Shaoyu, Wu Tiesheng, and Wu Mengtai</p>
<p>Published by Jingwen Publishing Bureau, first edition in July of the 36th year</p>
<p>The creation of words is based on the evolution of society. The more society evolves, the more new words are created, and old words that are outdated and unsuitable are unconsciously eliminated. The Second World War was an important turning point in modern history. The entire world has undergone great changes, reflecting the birth of new ideas and the abandonment of old traditions in military, political, economic, cultural, and educational fields. The English vocabulary, which represents the "universal language of the world," has also produced many new words and phrases with this war.</p>
<p>As long as we read books, newspapers, and magazines published in the United States and the United Kingdom, we will find many new words and phrases that cannot be found in ordinary dictionaries. Many readers are troubled by the difficulty of reading new newspapers and periodicals. It is not that they do not understand grammar and sentences, but that they encounter many new words and phrases that they do not understand. These new words and phrases affect our speed of reading newspapers and periodicals and hinder our understanding of the various things described in the books. Unless a new dictionary is published, we will not be able to break the barriers of thought.</p>
<p>This is a very useful new tool for the current book world. Recently, after reviewing it, I found it to be quite unique, so I will introduce it to readers. The words included in this dictionary include new words, new idioms, new meanings of old words, new usages of old words, and new slang, nearly 10,000 entries, all of which cannot be found in the most popular English-Chinese dictionaries on the market.</p>
<p>There is a convenience in checking, that is, words and phrases are arranged in alphabetical order, and phrases are not attached to any words. The part of speech will also be recorded in detail, and all phrases are treated as words. For example, allveryfine if auything should happen to on, etc. It seems that many new words in the fields of science and war have been collected, which should be of great help for reading scientific newspapers and periodicals. In addition to new words in English and American, general terms of other countries that have been recognized by the world are also collected. Many new slang and colloquialisms produced in English and American are adopted in this dictionary, which may be very convenient for us to read novels and general popular periodicals.</p>
<p>According to what the editors said in the preface, compiling this dictionary did take a lot of effort. In addition to referring to dictionaries of the same nature in English and American, they also extensively searched for modern readings (newspapers and periodicals), which shows that the compiling attitude of this dictionary is very cautious and different from copying and translating the original English and American dictionaries and appearing in China with a changed face.</p>
<h3>The Travels of Marco Polo</h3>
<p>— An Shou</p>
<p>Translated by Feng Chengjun. Published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Looking at "The Travels of Marco Polo" as a historical record can provide two important benefits.</p>
<p>First, we can get a glimpse of the living conditions of the people in China during the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Originally, Chinese historical records (in fact, Western history was the same in the past) had a huge shortcoming, which was to emphasize political activities and ignore social conditions. Therefore, we can see many unimportant royal family affairs, but there is no way to see more systematic descriptions of people's customs. "The Travels of Marco Polo," however, pays great attention to this aspect. For example, religious beliefs, food and clothing conditions, and marriage and funeral customs are all recorded. Although they are inevitably fragmented due to the limitations of the style, they are undoubtedly a valuable material for people studying Chinese history.</p>
<p>Second, we can use this to supplement some records of the "History of the Yuan Dynasty." The "History of the Yuan Dynasty" was hastily completed, and there are many fallacies. The records of political conditions in "The Travels of Marco Polo" are not many and not very accurate, but the reference value is still there. For example, in the second volume, it is recorded that the Yuan army's capture of Liyang was due to Western firearms, which is very believable. There are also many records of the killings of the princes of the Yuan Dynasty in the early Yuan Dynasty and the foreign wars of Yuan Shizu, which have differences from the "History of the Yuan Dynasty."</p>
<p>The original book is divided into four volumes. The first volume records the situation in northern West Asia and northwestern China, which is what Marco Polo saw and heard along the way from Europe to Mongolia at that time. The second volume records the court life of the Yuan Emperor and the situation in various provinces of China, which is the most important. The third volume records the situation in Japan, Vietnam, India, and the Nanyang regions. The fourth volume records the historical facts of the killings of the princes of the Yuan Dynasty in West Asia. What was the situation in ancient Asia? Even people who do not specialize in the history of the Yuan Dynasty want to know a little bit.</p>
<p>This translation provides many conveniences for readers because it has been annotated twice by Sha Haiang (A J H Chatignon, a Frenchman who became naturalized in China at the end of the Qing Dynasty) and the translator, correcting many errors and providing many necessary reference materials.</p>
<h3>Dostoevsky's "Poor People"</h3>
<p>— Xiang Xiu</p>
<p>Almost including Gorky, many people have a terrible misunderstanding of Dostoevsky, even calling his genius "cruel genius." Adding the word "cruel" to "genius" can easily make people feel gloomy about his character.</p>
<p>Was Dostoevsky really cruel? Let's see how Lu Xun explained "cruel genius":</p>
<p>"All great inquisitors of the human soul must also be great criminals. The inquisitor exposes his evil in the courtroom, the criminal states his own good under the steps, the inquisitor exposes the filth in the soul, and the criminal illuminates the buried glory in the filth that is exposed. In this way, the depth of the soul is revealed.</p>
<p>"In the deepest soul, there is neither 'cruelty' nor mercy; but what reveals this soul to people is a 'realist in the highest sense'." (See the preface to "Poor People")</p>
<p>Here, not only is it a fair judgment on Dostoevsky, but also a profound confession of his own works. In the sense of a deep soul, Lu Xun and Dostoevsky actually have similarities. Moreover, both of them were most influenced by Gogol's works.</p>
<p>In his works, Dostoevsky specializes in showing us those who are suffering from diseases, and have abnormal, criminal, crazy, decaying, and mysterious characters. Those characters are always combined with exile, poverty, staff, hunger, disasters, diseases, and death sentences. The atmosphere in his works is also full of terrifying pressure. When reading them, it often leads you into a bleak and dark, hell-like gloomy realm, making you tremble with fear, as if you are standing in the criminal court being tried, someone is questioning your soul, and you will not dare to hide your sins. The so-called sin here is often moral, not necessarily legal, and related to Christian SIN.</p>
<p>The best explanation for Dostoevsky's works is still in his own words borrowed from Zossima:</p>
<p>"Don't be anyone's judge: humble love is a terrible force that is more powerful than violence. Only this meticulous love can give birth to deep hearts. You have to love people, don't be afraid of their sins; love those who fall into the pit of sin; love all of God's creators. You also have to be happy like children and birds.</p>
<p>"Life will give you many unfortunate things, but for these, you still have to be happy, you must bless life, and make other people bless life."</p>
<p>In fact, this so-called "cruel genius" is full of bright hope and joy of life. In those humble characters, he constantly discovers their lofty love and life, and the true meaning of his works is to show us the lofty humanity of the "insulted and injured."</p>
<p>"Poor People" is Dostoevsky's first work. The whole police are written with quotation marks. There is no linked story, the letters talk about daily life trivialities, each other's inner pain. An aging accountant in middle age, who has been poor for a long time, is like a small grass that never sees the sun, growing in the cold world, one is a sick girl, an orphan who has lost her parents, like a remnant flower that has been blown down by the autumn wind, drifting everywhere. They are all penniless poor people, but God arranged for them to live in a place far away from each other. Because "they are all fallen people in the world," they secretly protect each other, conveying love in letters, that kind of spiritual union that transcends their flesh, clinging tightly to each other in extremely difficult and distressed lives. Struggling in despair, seeking survival in struggle, although it is painful, there is a kind of great happiness. But this kind of happiness does not continue for long, and the poor girl is forced into marriage by a middle-aged landlord. She has no power to resist. In the last letter, she said, "Now you must get used to living without me! How will you argue! Lonely, who will I throw you to here, my kind, precious, only friend..."</p>
<p>In this desperate cry, the old man's heart broke. What was left to him was a blank life!</p>
<p>Everything is written so sincerely and movingly. In their correspondence, various secret characters are also engraved around them, some scolding them, and some sympathizing with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Ju said this about Dostoevsky's works in "Russian Literature":</p>
<p>"His works are very similar to Greek tragedies because they express the adventure of solemn spirit, but not in the Christian faith and hope. Like Greek tragedies, they give readers the fearless courage of inspiration, never disappointing; although Dostoevsky faces evil face to face, he never hides or avoids those dangers, but the only purpose is to seek good souls in ugliness and sin..."</p>
<p>Now, we can easily understand the true meaning of the so-called "cruel genius." (This book is published by Wei Yuye, Wenguang Bookstore)</p>

<h3>Listening to the Voice of Humanity</h3>
<p>— Lun</p>
<p>––On the Origin and Theory of Speech</p>
<p>The question of the origin of human language has long interested people. For centuries, countless scholars have created countless theories, all trying to explain how the language of primitive people originated, and why there are so many languages ​​in the world.</p>
<p>The ancient Greek scholar Meto. Schechiriski said: "People initially lived a life similar to that of wild beasts. They gathered together out of fear of wild beasts and began to recognize each other. But their pronunciation was still meaningless and unclear; this sound was not a language at first. Like this, there are groups of people all over the world, so the basis for each different language was established."</p>
<p>Many philosophers speculate that primitive people used spontaneous, involuntary sounds to express the feelings and impressions they had when they first saw something or a phenomenon. Gradually, these natural cries became fixed names for this phenomenon or object, and thus became single words in the language.</p>
<p>Nuyale believed that language was produced at the same time as the joint labor of the most ancient people. Therefore, verbs were the first words to appear in the language. Von's opinion is that the language of sound and human consciousness occur at the same time. Soviet scholar Nikolai Yakovlevich Ma'er determined that the development of human language is: people talk in countless languages. After that, people have combined sound and sign language.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Dutch scholar Wang, Jinnaigen explained that the earliest sounds of human beings developed from the sucking movements of the tongue and throat that every baby understands. From here, the oldest sound of pulling the tongue from the teeth appeared in the writing, and even now, we can hear this sound in many primitive tribes. The original language is composed of complex ten-syllable sounds, and the appearance of vowels is much later. The language of sound started very late and was immediately composed of single words. However, Wang, Jinnaigen's dogmatism cannot be agreed upon.</p>
<p>American scholar Sandak determined that the ancestors of people had involuntary movements of the vocal organs from the earliest times. This movement produced ambiguous sounds that accompanied the emotions and experiences of human ancestors, even when they were alone in natural conditions. Single words appeared from this involuntary ambiguous sound and sounds with specific things or the meaning of actions. Later, these single words were used by this person's companions and became the heritage of the entire primitive tribe. Sandak's theory is still important because it shows that the development of language is a regular natural process that is not interfered by any supernatural forces.</p>
<p>The whole story takes place in a standard British-style hotel. Coward introduced the British people who were intently listening to the United Nations war reports broadcast on shortwave radios, their tense emotions, and their eager moods; he also introduced a vision of a British female spy being tortured and abused to death by Nazi stormtroopers. An underground military leader said to the captured Nazi special agent: "If you are leaving this world with resentment that the British are too inhospitable, please think about the British houses that you burned, the British property that you robbed, and the British people that you tortured, tormented, and killed. You have taken too much, and even paying back with blood is not enough!"</p>
<h3>The Face of Hitler on the British Stage - A New Drama Sweeping the British People</h3>
<p>— Liangzai</p>
<p>"If Hitler lands in England," what a terrible fantasy, how did the artillery fire collapse the grand buildings of London? How did the bright red flames devour the British families and properties that have been treasured and preserved for centuries? How did Hitler's Gestapo run rampant in Britain, murdering, looting, oppressing, tormenting, and treating those gentlemanly British people like cattle and horses? Recently, a new scene of "Peace! Peace in our Time" was staged in London. It is the latest masterpiece of the famous playwright Noel Coward. The people of London flocked to see it, and when the show was over, most of the audience bowed their heads, and some even had tears that had not dried. They seemed to have personally experienced this great disaster in their imagination in a short period of two or three hours.</p>
<p>Coward's rich imagination has created such a powerful story that many people believe that if London really fell into the hands of the devil, the actual situation would be similar to this.</p>
<p>In the plot, Churchill, the British prime minister of the war of resistance, was assassinated. Hitler actually convened a parliament and organized a puppet government, with all kinds of ugly monsters jumping out and ghostly shadows looming. But on the other hand, these kind British people put down their top hats and stood up stubbornly. They gathered all available weapons and organized a powerful underground army to deal with the Nazis.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes on Couplets</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>When Yongle was in the Yanwang's mansion, one day it was very cold. He warmed himself by drinking wine. During the banquet, he accidentally got a sentence: "The weather is cold and the ground is frozen, water cannot be water without a point." At that time, the monk Tong Yan was present, and he immediately responded: "The country is in chaos and the people are worried, who is the master if the king does not come forward?" They laughed together.</p>
<p>When the country is prosperous and the people are happy, celebrities and elegant scholars often have the act of drinking wine in the snow. According to legend, one day, Mr. Sun Yiyan of Ruian was drinking with his disciples. Seeing children piling up Guanyin, he suddenly felt and said: "The snow accumulates Guanyin, and the sun transforms the body and returns to the sea." After thinking for a long time, he could not get its matching sentence. A disciple said: "I have a pair, I don't know if it is possible?" Then he read: "Clouds become Arhats, the wind blows and walks up to the Western Paradise." Mr. Yi Shou kept his belt on.</p>
<p>There was a Xiucai who set up a museum to teach Meng. One day he thought of wine. There was a vegetable vendor at the door. Xiao Kangman ordered a pot to sell it. The vegetable vendor thought for a long time and said: "I have a couplet, can the gentleman answer it?" Xiucai said: "Try to say it." He said: "A long-necked tin pot has a mouth on its waist." Xiucai stared blankly and could not answer. He hurried to the room to prepare his luggage for his return plan. He accidentally realized when he opened the box and said: "A square-headed iron lock has a beard on its belly." He hurried out to look for the vegetable vendor, but the vegetable vendor was nowhere to be found.</p>
<h3>Entering and Leaving the Netherworld</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>French archaeologist Martin discovered the skull of a human being 150,000 years ago - see this newspaper on November 3.</p>
<p>Isn't it like a disease? What do archaeologists say? How strong is the skull of the primitive man? It has not rotted for 150,000 years, an unprecedented miracle</p>
<p>I often see it reported in newspapers, researching history, the dry bones of the ancients were wronged! Now that the time has come, ghosts should cry: death is also difficult.</p>
<h3>Retreating Bird</h3>
<p>— Lin Mei</p>
<p>People, beasts, and insects can walk forward, but they can also retreat to the left, right, and back. But have you ever seen a bird fly backwards? Your answer is often no. However, the Spring and Autumn Annals clearly records "six yiyi retreated and flew, and meteorites fell in Song." The yiyi is a bird, isn't this a clear proof of the retreat of birds? Because we have never seen a bird flying backwards, we have to suspect that this may be an absurd record; because there is often an unscientific absurdity in ancient books.</p>
<p>In fact, there are birds that retreat and fly. The name of that kind of bird is called "hummingbird." The "yiyi" mentioned in the Spring and Autumn Annals may be this kind of hummingbird.</p>
<p>The hummingbird is the bird with the strongest flying ability among birds. Its body is considered the smallest among birds. The feet of other birds on the ground cannot move from one in front of the other, so they also flap their wings when walking. Because it has been using its wings, its chest muscles are very developed, which is unmatched by any bird.</p>
<p>The legs of hummingbirds are very short, and the elbows are deeply embedded in the muscles. Because they cannot move freely, they cannot walk. In order to make up for this defect, it has the ability to fly in any direction. It can fly forward, sideways, up, down, and even backwards. No bird other than the hummingbird has ever flown backwards. Not only can it fly backwards, but it can also stay in the air, allowing it to consider the direction of flight.</p>
<p>Why do hummingbirds fly backwards? Because it is like a bee, it has to go to the heart of the flower to collect eggs. When it uses its slender beak to pierce into the heart of the flower to take honey, and then pulls its long beak out of the heart of the flower, it has to retreat backwards. Sometimes, it finds small insects that it can eat in the upside-down heart of the flower. It has to use its slender beak to peck, but it cannot hide the flower branches and scare away the small insects, so it has to fly and stop in the air and peck at its snack with its long beak. For this reason, it has developed the ability to retreat and stay in the air.</p>
<h3>Talking about T-Junction Traffic</h3>
<p>— Wu Daquan</p>
<p>After paying attention to the command of traffic at T-junctions many times, I found that there are two major schools of command methods: one school does not prohibit the vehicles of the same direction of "one horizontal" when the vehicles of the T "one straight" make a big turn; the other school prohibits it. The advantages and disadvantages of these two schools are not obvious at T-junctions where the traffic is not dense, but at T-junctions where the traffic is dense, the inappropriateness of the former school's command method is immediately revealed, as shown in the figure on the left:</p>
<p>According to the figure on the right, if vehicles in the same direction of "one horizontal" are allowed to continue to move forward, then four "motor vehicles" must be embedded in the line, and two or three "human-powered vehicles" must also be embedded in the line. The four that want to insert into the line must cut off the line that is making a big turn. As a result, in the triangle area, a traffic jam is caused. In the triangle area, there are many and mixed human-powered vehicles making a big turn and human-powered vehicles moving in the same direction. Vehicles often collide, forming a difficult situation to resolve. In this situation, traffic falls into extreme chaos, so horns sound in chaos, quarrels arise, hands are used to fight, and order is immediately destroyed. Therefore, I feel that when making a big turn at a T-junction, vehicles of "one horizontal," regardless of the opposite direction or the same direction, must be prohibited from moving forward. This aspect of the command method should be unified.</p>
<h3>Strange Occupations</h3>
<p>— Lin Lin</p>
<p>Among insects and plants, some are indeed very peculiar; and their peculiarity is often unnoticed by the average person.</p>
<p>Plants, for example, are even stranger; and most of these plants grow in the tropics.</p>
<p>"Orphan Grass," as its name suggests, has no mother because it is a rootless plant that parasitically grows on tree trunks.</p>
<p>"Hundred-Year Grass" never dies; if it is not taken by humans, when you crush a leaf of "Hundred-Year Grass," its needle-like leaves are connected to many thin and tough fibers; therefore, the Native American Indians of Central and South America use these fibers to weave very strong fabrics.</p>
<p>There is a type of palm tree that stores a hidden water tank at the base of its leaves; cutting open the end of the leaf reveals about a pint of clear water. "Lianas" also flow with a stream of clear white water after being cut open. There is also a more magical type called "Cow Tree," cutting open its trunk actually makes it flow with a sweet and delicious liquid that tastes almost the same as cow's milk.</p>
<p>There is a kind of vine that grows with two sharp small leaves, which can be used for shaving and trimming beards.</p>
<p>There is also a "Rape Tree" in North Africa, which will "rape" people to death alive, because when people touch the "stimulating part" of its branches, they are wrapped by the roots of the "Rape Tree" and then die.</p>
<h3>Bernays Reveals the Secrets of the Four Powers' Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>We have received reports that Song had informed his government that the Soviet Union had made demands beyond the Yalta secret agreements. Since the negotiations were conducted according to President Roosevelt's instructions, I became interested. Fearing that Mr. Song might not be able to withstand Soviet pressure and might make further concessions before understanding our attitude, I notified the Chinese government, with the President's approval, that we did not advise China to make any concessions beyond the terms of the Yalta secret agreements.</p>
<p>China and the Soviet Union eventually concluded a treaty, but the facts revealed that our concern for Dalian was correct. Two years after Japan's defeat, Dalian was still not a free port. Before a ship could enter this port, it had to obtain permission from Moscow, not only for the ship but also for the people on board.</p>
<p>In a later meeting, Stalin told the President and me that the Japanese ambassador in Moscow had inquired about the Soviet Union's willingness to serve as an intermediary to end the war. Stalin said that this request did not indicate that Japan was willing to surrender unconditionally as demanded by the Allies; the tone was very vague, so Mr. Molotov only told the Japanese ambassador that the matter would be discussed with him again soon. Stalin said that later the Japanese ambassador sent another official document. It stated that Japan was willing to send Duke Konoe to Moscow to show Japan's intention to end the war, but if it were required to surrender unconditionally, Japan would definitely fight to the end with all its strength. Stalin added that he had therefore sent a letter to the Japanese ambassador, explaining that because this point was very vague and there was no specific proposal, it was impossible to give a definite reply. President Truman expressed his approval of Stalin's actions.</p>
<p>At this time, Secretary Stimson told us that he had received a report on the atomic bomb test in New Mexico on July 16. The bomb had been as successful as desired, and if used, it would surely annihilate the already unstable enemy in one fell swoop. Before the test, we agreed that if it proved successful, we would first give the Japanese a final stern warning and then use it.</p>

<p>Service Briefs</p>
<p>Looking for Father My father is thirty-nine years old, from Damingfu, Hebei. Before the War of Resistance, he was a first lieutenant in the mountain artillery battalion of the 89th Division. He graduated from the Nanjing Communications School in the 35th year of the Republic of China and was ordered to return to his original unit. He bid farewell to my mother and others in July of that year and went to Fenyang, Shanxi, where he was stationed. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, after the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, my mother took her children to the rear. Since then, we have lost contact. It has been ten years now, and his fate is uncertain. Now my mother and three children are stranded in Shanghai, temporarily living in the Temporary Refugee Camp at No. 420, Molu Road, Zhabei. If any officers or soldiers of the same division know his whereabouts, please kindly inform us. Your kindness will be like a rebirth. Wang Yinyun and his mother Su Zhen respectfully</p>
<p>Certificate of Loss On the 24th of this month, I carried my high school diploma, certificates of former positions as committee members at all levels in the Anti-Japanese Army, a family household registration guarantee, and private property, etc., to receive winter clothing after joining the army, and took the No. 2 public bus back to Laoximen. I forgot my cloth handbag, causing it to be lost on the bus. If anyone finds it, please mail the diploma and certificates, so that I can obtain a job with the documents and my family can survive. Your kindness is immeasurable. He Quanming sincerely. Send letters to the Job Introduction Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs at No. 856, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai.</p>
