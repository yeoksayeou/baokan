<h3>政府期待和談重開　延安答覆尙未到京　張治中氏昨曾晉謁主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕政府為期和平商談即能重開，一再表示容讓，復縱商定新方案，并擬即派張治中等赴延安，此事經司使通知中共後，各方視綫咸集中於中共之答復如何。截至＋七日晚，共黨辦事處方面稱：尙未接獲覆電。某段威人士於分折常前域內外局勢時，對此次和談能否重開問題觀察共方或可能有一新表示，認為前途樂觀之成分較多，至張治中本人除昨曾表示希望去延安代表能多派數人外，十七日晨曾謁主有所商陳，晚趁于右任宴，席間與邵力于敘談甚久。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕政府將派張治中赴延安事，經司使通知中共後，中共業於十六日電延安請示，目前正待覆電中，政府亦在等待此項回答，張本人表示·政府使命，欣願接受。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕司使私人顧問傳涇波，十七日晨九時訪張洽中。據聞：傅氏曾表示，美方希望政府着重商談內容，不僅造成一種和談空氣，且須實際上能使國共雙方之意見確能接近。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十七日電〕張治中赴延安日期，待中共之答覆而定。張氏稱：中共對此反應，可能再派代表來京，重開和談，果爾，則余將終止延安之行。和平新方案，政府暫不宣布，並稱：渠如赴延安將有另一作政府大員同行，惟是否張君或邵力子，渠未言明，祇對談判前途，個人表示樂觀而已。</p>
<p>〔又電〕王炳南稱：和平建議，已於十六日電告延安，但未悉何時能接獲延安答覆，諒俟延安諸領袖獲後，方能答覆政府。此間有資格之政治家相信，延安不致拒絕張氏飛往延安。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關人士表示，重開和談目前尙在試　階段，預料由共對於和談不致出以堅拒之態度，蓋否則將負破壞和談之惡名，惟和談重開易，和平　致難，一切尚須出之忍耐。政府代表此次來滬，僅將和談方案之主要項目提出，而未言明詳細辦法，蓋恐機密外洩，有碍和談之進行，事實上，方案中若干要點，恐尙有待最高當局之最後指示。</p>

<h3>民盟時局宣言　決完後日發表</h3>
<p>〔革報訊〕民盟定廿日下午二時，似九江路清華同學會舉行記者招待會，發表時局宣言，並定同日下午四時半招待外籍記者。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟范樸齋氏對記老談稱：和談重開，雙方之互信最關重要，條件次之，如互信不立，則條件愈多，成功之希望愈少。又和談進行時之空氣及情緒關係亦甚大，今日回憶政　決議成立時之和諧氣象，　有隔世之感。</p>
<h3>曾琦左舜生抵京</h3>

<h3>央航滬平客機　在平強迫降落</h3>
<p>行李換失乘客安全</p>

<h3>俞部長出席參政會　報告外匯等問題　出席參政員紛紛提質詢</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕中英商約談判，我方對案已提出，現正由英方研究。聞主要癥結爲內河航行與居住二點，我方之態度爲太古·怡和兩公司航輪，決不能再在我內河航行·而英方對我僑胞居住其本土三島·自治領或印度，亦有歧視規定，不若美國辦法之公允。雙方在作最後決定前，恐尙需相當時期之磋商。</p>
<h3>民社黨和談意見　雙方必須實行還軍於國還政於民　和談關鍵始可迎刃而解</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國民主社會黨昨發表對於和談之意見稱：</p>
<p>本黨對於最近國共兩黨之恢復和談，寄予無窮希望。</p>
<p>回憶年來國共兩黨和談之所以不能成功，其最大原因，在彼此各有其兵力，一面互相猜忌，以爲對方有消減我之野心，一面各自稱雄，以爲我有消減對方之機會，今後若仍復如此，和談恐永不能成功。然本黨對於此次和談，猶寄予無窮希望者，因爲　軍於國，還政於民，已成爲政協決議。國共兩方亦皆承認，此事必當實行，本黨希望國民黨先從自身做起，現在中央政府關於黨與政府之界限，尙未明白劃清，亦可說黨在政府之上，軍隊屬於黨，政府受黨指揮，今爲免除共黨之猜忌，惟有國民黨切切實實還軍於國，現役軍人完全脫離黨籍，國民黨退處普通政黨之列，同時還政於民，則共產黨所以猜忌政府與國民黨合而爲一的心理，或可消除。能如此，國民黨方可以光明磊落要求共產黨還軍於國，和談關鍵得此即可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>聞中共方面堅持恢復一月十三日以前狀態，假令中共亦還軍於國，國共兩黨並非劃疆分治，則國軍駐紮於彼此共有之國土，便無所謂一月十三日以前與以後之分。中共同時又反對業已召開之國大與其通過之憲法，但其所通過之憲法係根據政協憲章，應爲各方所共認，即有未能同意之處，俟下屆開會依照修正條文提出修正。至國民黨旣還政於民，則不祇是開放中央政權，地方政權亦應同時開放，中共又何必一定劃分某地爲中共政權，某地爲中共以外之政權，良以同處一國之中，同一法系同一政制之下，方能成爲國家。誠如上支所言，則還軍於國，還政於民，國共二方皆以誠意勉力實行，方是民主，方是和平，能和平民主，國家自然統一，自然強大，否則各擁其黨有之軍隊，各　其黨有之政權，即是反民主，反民主則不能和平，下能統一，民主之眞諦，不在文字之宣傳，而在事實之表現，和談之結晶在此，改組政府之精神亦在此。</p>
<p>今國家情勢，危殆已極，經濟崩潰，魚爛將亡，到底有何大不了之事，而不能棄嫌歸好。</p>
<p>本黨對於國共兩方皆無偏袒，希望兩方皆能切切實實還軍於國，還政於民，共同造成一個超然於各黨之上公平正直之法治政府，自然可以受舉國人民之擁戴，千言萬語之和談，必以此爲根本。能如此，　　覺悟，能如此。就是成功，區區之意，全爲垂死人民請命，望國共兩黨人士其接納之。</p>
<h3>北大女生被強姦案　平美軍事法庭開審　今繼續審理沈女士決出庭</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕美兵強姦北大女生沈崇案，十七日晨九時公審，十八日績審，被害人沈女士，十八日以證人資格出庭。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十七日電〕美駐華海軍陸戰隊第一師組織軍事法庭，於十七日上午九時公審美兵伍長威廉士皮爾遜於卅五年十二月廿四日在東單操場對北大女生沈崇暴行一案，該軍事法庭係由一審判長及六軍法官組成，審判長爲休士中校。開庭時，檢察官費茲吉羅得中校偕一助理出席，被告辯護人馬斯得中校（即第五團參謀長）亦偕助理出庭，實行皮爾遜依美國法律容許出席坐於辯護人之下側，法庭另有書記兩人，翻譯官三人。十七日晨原定九時開庭，因故延至九時三十分開庭，聽旁人計有被告人之監護人沈劭（沈女之父）北大校長胡適，楊振清（沈之表兄），沈崇之法律顧問李士彤，趙鳳喈，市府外事廳長左明徵，警察局外事科長孟昭楹，行轉外事處秘書呂賓東，外交部辦事處主任秘書張述先，地院首席檢察官紀元，憲兵第十九團代表以及中外記者等廿七人。</p>
<p>法官宣誓忠實職守　宣布被告罪犯五端</p>
<p>審判日期爲十七·十八，本日審訊時間爲上午九時半至十二時，下午一時十五分至二時四十分。審判開始，先由審判長。全體法官·書記依法宣誓忠實職守，旋檢察官宣布開庭。（中央社按：美國軍事法庭之規定，由檢察官主詰，受害人亦爲證人之一，審判長爲超然地位，每一受詰之證人，必須由審判長領導宣誓，表達願將事實眞相全盤托出，否則受法律製裁）。檢察官宣讀起訴書，宣布被告犯罪五端：（一）強姦，（二）脅迫強姦，（三）姦非，（四）破壞軍紀，（五）妨害風化。按查上述五罪端，其中二三四五等四項，在我國法律中無適當相等之名詞，二四五等三項舉譯文相似，然其含意亦與我法律不盡相同，至第三項尤無適當名詞可循，按世界標準英漢辭典詳釋（Forni　Cation）一字爲（未婚男女之直接性行爲）其法律名詞之意義，又與普通字典不同，本社譯名僅供參考，應以原文爲凖。宣讀後，旋詢被告，被告否認犯一二四五等四項罪狀，謂第三項雖可承認，亦僅爲在軍事法庭中受詰之答覆，在民事法庭中，則不能承認。</p>
<p>證人依次出庭作供　先後陳述目擊情形</p>
<p>檢察官嗣即依次傳詢各證人，審判長於每一證人供述完畢，均詢問證人三點：（一）還有要說之話否？（二）庭上有不明瞭處，可以解釋，（三）庭上情形不得直接或間接告知他人。傳詞之證人爲：（一）麥克奈爾上尉（美陸戰隊第一師第五團情報員）呈獻美兵肇事地圖一紙。（二）孟昭傑（第十一戰區汽車修理班工徒），渠爲第一個目擊人，謂去年十二月廿四日晚八時三十分在東長安街平安電影院門前購買香烟，目賭兩美兵架一女人至平安影院對面樹林中，此女曾作哭聲，乃約同事趙玉華，趙澤田，馬文彬，強志新等五人中有兩人持電筒，渠等在距離兩丈處瞥見一美兵與該女生在南大地處之牆根下，另一美兵則在距彼等兩尺之側，乃又返回報告平安影院正在檢查之稽查員二人，七人又往親，至後被美兵則在距彼等兩尺之側，乃又返回報告平安影院正在檢查之稽查員二人，七人又往觀，至後被美兵驅拒，彼等遂離去，彼等五人至王府共南口報告巡邏繁至有該女哭　處調查。檢察官問畢，被告辯護人作同樣結果詢，孟答稱：在平安門前因聽女人哭呌聲而前往觀看，當時美兵暴行情形，亦如上述。美兵所在處，光綫不明不暗，無月色，無風。（三）強志新（職業同孟）所供美兵暴行當時情形與孟相似，渠見一美兵　彼等，並奪一稽查員手槍。（四）馬文彬（第十一戰區　事修理班助手）供稱：夜間認不出美兵面目，於第三次返回草塲時所得手套，係趙澤田所拾，其他供詞與孟同。（五）趙澤田（職業同孟）供稱：與孟第三次在南大地，曾爲一美兵阻止，當庭認出拾得之手套，並謂：手套上當時有血跡與沙土，彼並聽見女的哭聲，未聽見彼等說話聲。（六）唐文華（警備司令部上等兵即稽查員）供稱：　拒彼等之美兵，曾搶彼之三八武槍。（七）王桐（警察局車巡大隊第二隊　士，調警備部軍營電聯合統一巡查服務）供稱：以手電筒照見當時一美兵與一女被另一美兵驅逐，又謂言詒隔閡，故未強迫。（八）關德後（內七分局一等警士）供稱：當晚十時三十分，　　　告往查此事，在南大地聽見女作哭聲，及近，見一美兵及一女躺在地上，以國語喝令美兵起來，美兵答以粗暴班諸人抓狂，渠則維護該女，其時美兵曾欲奪抱該女，該女躱在渠背後。關並供稱：除因哭聲尋見美兵與該女外，並見一件白色物件搖動，是時地點在東大地空房之東北方，距哈德門大街七八十步，美兵找獲後，即在東單擱在中美聯絡室巡邏車報告。關結詢畢，已十二時，休息。</p>
<p>沈女士精神受刺激　手中持褲謂被強姦</p>
<p>午後一時十五分繼續公審，胡適·何思源因公未至旁聽。（一）劉尙志（保安警察隊十三中隊營士）供稱：當時美兵暴躁，態度惡化，常其逃走時，彼以槍擋住。其時，該女站在關後，手中執一白色物，詢女知爲伊之褲，乃令其着上，該女對彼謂被強姦。蔡紹明（中美聯絡室外務巡官）乃令其着上，該女對彼謂被強姦。（二）蔡紹明（中美聯絡室外務巡官）供稱：於十時卅分鐘左右（因當時未帶表），爲警士關德後等在東單攔下第一號巡邏車，報告二美兵架一中國女性，並在　塲強姦該女。彼等乃同往，當時見該女着深色大衣，未扣，衣上有土，面上，鼻上亦有土，因伊大衣未扣，故見衣服零亂，頭髮亦零亂，大衣後面下方潮　，神態似精神受刺激。該女稱爲「北女大生」及其姓氏爲沈某，後因精神受刺激，即不能再說話矣。該美兵着制服大衣，徒手，此外，關等報告尙拾得手套一只，上有血與泥土，因此乃第二號巡邏軍張英俊科員連轄區，故俟張到達，即將此案交由張等辦理。被告辯護人是時曾嚴請問是否見及沈小姐面部有淚痕，彼答稱：在肇事處因光綫不明，未瞥見，但同至美國　軍陸戰隊憲兵司令部光綫充足時，曾見沈小姐臉上有淚痕，至向美憲兵司令部與同張科員之報告，係根據關　　等之報告，其內容相同，至是審判長宣布十八日上午九時績審。〔中央社按：本稿供詞係當堂旁聽速記，如有　誤，應以法庭筆錄爲凖。〕（完）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>上海市預算問題</h3>
<p>上海市參議會第一次大會，實際上可說是側重討論三十六年度市預算的一决大會，可是開了九天會，依然因爲預算收支不敷較鉅，無法平衡，如何開源節流，有待詳盡商討，不能不從十五日起暫行延會若干天，以俟各小組審查委員會的繼續研究。我們當然希望市參議會，能從極感困難的環境中，在兼顧市民負担與市政需要的夾縫中，獲得彌補預算赤字的方法。</p>
<p>平心而論，上海市三十六年度經臨兩門總預算二三〇八憶餘，再加調整生活補助費的二〇〇億，不下二五〇〇億，驟看起來，似乎很大，但把三十五年度下半年度七五〇餘億比較，則三十六年度加倍應爲一五一〇億，目前所列，僅較此數加了六成，與一般物價增漲相比，不能謂之過度。但是重要的問題，倒不在此項數字之是否需要，而在下列三點：（一）此數市民是吾負担得起？（二）市民負担如何可以公平？（三）市府收入如何用法？</p>
<p>我們以爲：先就第一點言，好像上海市面衰落，工商凋敝，捐稅繁重，民不堪命，大有不勝負担之苦。其實上海市民的負担，大部分乃對於中央國庫之負祖，譬如即就直接稅，貨物稅二者，上海市民一月的負担，手頭雖無詳確統計，也就恐怕要超過他們對於市庫全年的負祖。土地稅和營業稅，在戰前都爲地方稅收，但照目前財政收支系統附表的規定，中央却還要從這些稅裹提去四成求三成不等。故上海市民負担之所以重，百分之九十以上是爲了國家。我們絕不是暗示市民可以少納中央的稅，不過不能不指出市民爲了地方的市政而有的負荷，還不能說是已經過了限度。而况市面衰落工商凋敝形勢之所以造成，其責任究應歸之於何方，乃何種政策之結果，見仁見智雖各有不同，要亦不能全說市政當局應獨負其責。露骨言之，此二千五百億之數字，如以一般物價較戰前爲八千倍計之，不過値戰前的三千萬，上海市民縱算日趨貧困，也未必一定不勝負擔。惟須使市民負擔要得其公平，而市稅所入要用得恰當，一錢收一錢之用。</p>
<p>於是我們要論及第二點：要使市民的負担近乎公平，我們首先要主張中央應即採納市參議會的建議，在上海市戰後元氣凋喪，而中央已接收大批物資之際，恢復戰前的地方稅全歸地方使用的制度，不再從地價稅提撥四成，從營業稅提撥三成，使市庫得以稍减拮据，即按市政府所提預算原案計算，此兩宗提撥之款當已達二百億，而况就市參議會預算小組會的估計，兩稅均尚可增收三百億以上，如果估計離事實不遠，則市庫歲入當可增加五百億，換言之，市民稍减其對中央的負担，而稍增其對於地方市政的負担，也是情理所可通。其次，娛樂稅與筵席稅，旣爲地方稅，其稅率應讓地方政府經過地方民意機關的決議自行制定。像上海這樣奢華風氣視爲尋常的社會，如果因地制宜，則此兩種稅率，大有考慮重行分等之餘地，而最高額之規定，允應視過度奢侈之程度以爲斷。我們一方面要提倡簡單樸素的新生活，一方面却由中央立法來限制了可以寓禁於徵的征稅方法，實在是一件憾事。最後，我們以爲市政建設捐和公用事業附征市政建設捐，這兩種捐稅雖爲本市地方特別稅課，但就其征收對象，標準，與方法而言，與其說是苛捐，無寗稱爲良稅只要規定稅率恰當，估計房租準確，則使有某種生活能力以上的市民，按其負祖房租能力的高下，以定其對市政經費負祖的多少，最覺公道，而且收稅手續簡單，事務開支不大，更於市庫有益。我們要奉勸市參議會，在審議的時候，只須大公無私，訴諸理性，則明智的決定，當能爲市民所諒解。至於國民義務勞動代役金，那是根據國民義務勞動法令的一種特別規定，其意義與其說是重在「代役金」，不如說重在「義務勞動，」而義務勞動在中國只可以「富於人力」自豪的戰後建設期間，應是一種値得稱道的政策。不過，這不應該看做一個彌補預算的問題。我們願另爲文以討論之。</p>
<p>第三點。是中心問題，就要問：市政府的稅收怎樣支配用途？我們就市參議會的討論經過，及一般市民的意見，大體默察，倒並不一定是震驚其預算總數之龐大，乃若深有憾於冗員與駢枝機關之過多，以致行政經費與事業經費比例之不相稱。如果市政當局能看到市民內心的深處，本着「民之所好好之」的精神，在參議會的支持之下，痛下決心，調整機構，裁汰冗員，與其多用人而少加薪，不如多加薪而少用人，使用一人有一人之用，做一日有一日之功，而把前年秋冬以來，機關層疊，員役累進的現象大加改觀，則市民觀感所及，必能深知他們所納的稅，大部分用之於他們所仰望切需的事業上去，其心理上的安慰將無可以形容。只要市府收了稅去，一天一天進步，道路不高低不平了，溝渠不汚水上湧了，垃圾不堆積了，糞便不觸目了，交通不阻塞了，學校不拒收學齡兒童了，土地證件的登記不要捱到幾個月了，……諸如此類，市民所仰望而切需的設施，市政府在必要的員工努力之下，一件一件的推進與實現，而不把市民的稅課絕大部分用之於員工的生活費，機關的行政費，我們相信上海市的預算當可通過於市參議會，也可以見諒於全市四百萬的市民的。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕巴西對德之要求，已於今日由巴西代辦古蒂埃向四外長代表會提出。巴西認爲爲獲得和約討論時更有效之合作起見，不但應准許小國陳述其意見，並應許其有討論其他各國意見之機會。巴西深望德國他日能成爲和平國際秩序整個之一部，使其不致再發動侵略戰。</p>

<h3>蘇聯對德新决議　美認為違反四國協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十七日電〕蘇聯當局發表提高蘇軍佔領區德工業生產兩倍至三倍之方案，美軍司令克葉及其他聯合國代表殊出意外。克氏已請聯合國對德管制委會蘇代表於下决會議時加以說明。據美國方面稱，依照四國原來協定，應將德工業生產力减少百分之三十五至五十，此項方案則欲使德工業生產超過戰前水準，下免爲一種幻想，且係破壞四國協定。此方案係由蘇聯贊助之社會統一黨報紙發表，預示蘇聯謀在莫斯科外長會議中與其他佔領國成立協議，自德國現有生產中取得賠償，此事於蘇聯係屬有利，因其國內銷費品殊感缺乏云。</p>

<h3>從一個英國人眼光中看盟國佔領下的日本（一）</h3>
<p>— 約翰·摩里斯原著　張德乾譯</p>
<p>筆者前譯「佔領期中的日本」一文，見去年十一月十七日至十九日本報，係「紐約時報」駐東京特派員派勞脫原作，足以窺見美國人對於佔領日本的一種觀點。茲復見英國權威雜誌「兩週評論」十一月號載有「盟軍佔領下的日本」一文，頗足代表英國人的一種觀點，爰復譯出，以供讀者參閱。</p>
<p>（一）日本近况</p>
<p>戰前我曾在日本住過四年。我於珍珠港事件爆發後八個月，即一九四二年七月，才離開日本。那時候日本的生活狀况已經是苦透了。東京國被杜立德將軍空襲過一次，那决空襲不過是一種示威而已。我最後一次經過東京市區時，是坐在集中營的公共汽車裏，往碼頭去搭僑俘交換船。那時候的東京，雖然顯得破爛，仍還不失爲一個都市，有七百萬人在那兒生活着，工作着，娛樂着。</p>
<p>我最近才從日本回來，曾在那兒住過六個月。給我印象最深的是在過去四年中所發生的廢圯和損害。在戰爭期間，我密切地注意着日本的事態。我曾在心中塑起一個相當淸晰的影子，以爲日本應常是像那樣子的。可是竟和實際狀况完全不像。</p>
<p>要了解日本的現况是不能够用我們所知道的歐洲的破壞情形來估量的。例如倫敦，即使是在最酷烈的空襲之後，終還有點東西剩下來；也許所剩下的祗是些地窖或外牆，至少這是什麼地方終還可以爲得出來。在日本却完全不同。你得明白，日本的一般都市祗有極少數建築物是鋼骨水泥的，其餘百分之九十，不論是住屋，店舖，甚至工廠，都是木造的。日本都市中祗有京都從未炸過，還有許多大鎭市也都未炸過。東京的中部，沿皇宮四周，雖然炸過，仍與戰前相差不多。這兒那兒都有些斷垣殘壁，可是大致看來，尚與倫敦受炸較輕區域相似。這地方多數爲銀行和大商家；現在幾乎全部用來作爲佔領軍的營房。躑躅在街頭巷尾，耳鼓裏充滿着盟軍無錢電不停地播送着的嘈雜的音樂，閑散的GI靠在牆邊沈思着；這景象和鄧阜或英國中西部任何較小的城市一般無二。你還看見少數日本人，他們似乎是誤入這一個區域的。</p>
<p>今日東京　面目全非</p>
<p>可是走出道一區域，那景象就完全不同了。日本人自稱東京爲世界第三大都市，現在，除開那倖存的一小區之外，其餘部份簡直已經消滅了。在去年的三次大轟炸中，已經把一切都燒爲灰塵。東京的毀滅幾乎和古國加太基的毁滅一樣。希奇的是街頭雖然那樣破爛，却還存在着，仍舊有電軍在行駛。澴有少數破舊的公共汽車也在行駛。出租汽車却一輛也沒有。要乘電車得排着隊等候個把鐘頭，才能够上車。電車裏的座位全都撤除了，以便多容納些乘客，甚至於踏脚板上也都擠滿着人。暈倒和死傷是常有的事。因爲載重過度，電車在稍爲傾斜的街頭上幾乎爬不動。地下鐵道在戰前是很淸潔良好的，現在的情形也和地上差不多。車站裏又髒又暗，地道裹的一股氣味像是一條大陰溝，使你覺得好像是在瓦礫堆中旅行。各區的地名自然還是照舊，可是沒有什麼東西可以使你認得出那是什麼地方來了。</p>
<p>多數市民集居郊外</p>
<p>戰前東京的人口約有七百萬。現在已减至約三百萬，其中大多數都住在多少未受損害的遼遠的郊區。在市區工作的人（佔領軍自然得僱用許多日本人），每天得耗費五六個鐘頭在路上。原來預備一個家庭居住的小屋子現在却住了十幾個人。日本人雖然向來就不像我們那樣注重分宗居住各不相擾的，可是若照現在這樣子生活下去，我想他們是不會在社會上和思想上發生必要的變化，使他們將來能够在和平民主的世界上佔一席地的。</p>
<p>關於這一方面自然還有許多東西可寫，可是我的目的祇在把佔領軍執行工作的背景畫出一個輪廓來，就此打住。</p>

<h3>中法新空綫　正式開航日期　尚待我國決定</h3>
<p>法國放空公司為視察越南與中國間之航空線，特派DC—4型F—BBDE號巨型機，由巴黎起飛，經西貢香港等地，於前日下午二時半抵滬，機內設備及裝璜均頗美觀。該機定本月十九日自滬返法。記者昨特往訪該公司駐滬負責人總視察脫立琪稱，法國航空公司為開闢法國與中國間之空運事宜，故決定開闢中法間之新航綫，此次　F—BBDE號係首次來華訪問，不日回法後於短期內仍將繼續來華，以便與中國政府之交通部取得密切之聯繋。至於正式開航日期，依照中法兩國航空商約之規定，須兩國航空公司同時開航，同日起飛，故法國航空公司之開航期，有待中國政府決定，中航或央航公司，參加飛航後，始能正式開航。惟中國航機，祇能飛至越南，西貢或河內，因航空商約內，并未規定中國至巴黎間之飛航。至於法國航空公司通華之各口岸，亦須經中國政府規定後，始能公布云。</p>
<p>另據可靠方面消息，中國航空公司在法越軍隊未衝突前，即有航機飛往越南河內，後因法越發生戰事而中止。根據此種事實，今後中法越南間之航綫，可能由中國公司擔任。</p>

<h3>舊曆年關期中　各綫航輪照常行駛　路局增開還鄕專車</h3>
<p>京滬區鐵路管理局，前以農曆年關迫近，為疏通運務，特增開還鄕專車，惟以售票情形極為紊亂，影響車站秩序至鉅，復特訂定「還鄕專車售票辦法」，為還鄕專車之旅客，購買客票，無論其在何站下車，均須購買在各該列車終點站，但京滬綫曾駛之四等專車，各停靠站須與各該終點站間所訂有四等票價方得發售，是項專車客票，凡客票價目表內，并未規定票價之車價，槪不發售，至滬杭綫之九二·九四次特快車，係屬區間車延長行駛者，故均照舊發售客票。又：各次特別還鄕專車按現行特快車票發售辦法辦理之。</p>
<p>又該局以時屆年終，旅客難免有携带各種花砲乘車情事，甚易發生危險，故決嚴禁携帶，如有私携登车者，一經發覺除沒收花砲外，并予嚴辦云。</p>

<p>去年度航運界之業務頗見發達，且各綫行駛船隻數量亦逐漸增加，但多數民營航業公司因一切開支浩大，而運費及票價甚低，均并無有若干之盈餘。</p>
<p>又據國營招商局副總經理沈仲毅氏昨對華東社記者談稱：該局舊曆新年決照常辦公并不休假，唯各綫航輪如客貨減少，航期或可延緩，目前各綫航務照常，滬臺綫將於下星期一尚有客輪駛臺。</p>

<h3>三審臧大二子案　凶犯初次上公堂　　美海軍伍長路特立克應傳出庭　辯稱打車夫動機在自衛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕臧大二子慘死案，兇手美海軍海倫艦伍長路特立克，昨應地院傳訊，出庭爲賴令奈作證。下午三時吳炎林推事臨時昇庭傳訊，因不及通知被害人家屬，僅由代理律師陳震出庭。路特立克由美海軍少校約翰生押解到庭，供稱：二十五歲，美國籍，海倫艦伍長，統率士兵三十二人。第一次來滬係在去年九月十八日，僅泊留一月即離去，三月後再度來此，九月二十二日下午十時曾至筆都，亦曾至酒吧間，但未飲酒，亦未上樓，入門時即見賴令奈正在飲酒，二人雖不素識，但先後出門通見，因見人力事夫向賴要錢，賴稱錢已給過，而車夫仍糾纏不放，並將賴令奈毆打，賴並不反抗，於是我即向車夫揮打一拳，車夫即倒地。庭上詰之：賴令奈旣與汝素不相識，何需汝毆打車夫？路特立克答；蓋此時余已認賴爲友。</p>
<p>庭上繼詢美軍事法庭偵訊情形，約翰少校起身答稱：此案證據業已收集完畢，偵審終結，唯未判耳。因判決需呈報華盛頓後始能決定。庭上諭告云：根據處理在華美軍人員刑事案件條例第四條第二項之規定，本院有權查詢該案處理情形。復向的翰詢問：旣已審結，係依何法條起訴。約翰答：依殺人罪。繼問動機如何？答係出於自衛，並無敎唆情形。庭上繼稱：本院曾發二信，請求答覆，唯迄未接到覆信，何故？的翰答：已分別覆送吳市長及美領事館轉奉，想不久可到。並稱路特立克最近即將押送返國。下次不能再出庭作證。庭上以太案證人趙阿弟等二人未到，諭改期再審。敎唆殺人嫌疑犯賴令奈昨亦提出對質，據稱對路特立克已不復認識。賴滿以爲此次大赦後，彼即可出獄，殊不知其所犯罪嫌之最重本刑，在有期徒刑以上，故僅能减刑，而不能赦免，訊後仍還押。</p>
<h3>鄭良斌再審一堂　陳春圃被傳作證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鄭良斌漢奸嫌疑案，昨在高院續審，並傳訊證人。被告鄭良斌，寗波人，一向服務於航業界，卅三年三月投敵，充任敵華中輪船公司船舶部長，偽國民新聞社總經理，僞由政會外交專門委員，僞建設部上海辦事處長。被告新理髮，平頂頭，面色白晳，穿藍布套袍。供認曾任僞職，惟對於僞國民新聞社總經理一職，稱係因李士羣要錢，曾捐助該社五萬元，送一名義。僞中政會外交專門委員係掛名，從未領過薪水。</p>
<p>告發人張翊世稱：因被告將我的輪船侵佔，故提出撿舉。侵佔時期爲廿八年，彼時被告尚未充任僞職。所有谷項僞職均係確實，常庭呈上被告有銜名片一張。庭諭二關於侵佔部份，因不在被告任僞職期內，可另以民事起訴　繼傳已判死刑之陳春圃到庭作證，陳骨瘦如柴，頭髮花白，穿藍布套袍，翻口花呢鞋。陳證稱：被告與春圃戰前就是朋友，出任上海辦事處長係春圃派的，與上海航業界方面連絡。</p>
<p>昨日該案本應審理終結，因被告律師章士釗，陳霆銳之請求，尚需傳訊兩重要證人，諭知改期再訊。</p>
<h3>趙尊嶽昨日續審　辯論終結　廿四宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨日審理趙尊嶽，被告武進人，五十歲，南洋公學畢業，戰前曾任申報記者，華北政務委員會參議兼宣傳科長，鐵道部參事。上海淪陷後，被告由香港返滬，經汪之勸誘，參加僞組織，歷任僞由政會委員，僞鐵道部政務次長，僞行政院政務委員，偽上海市政府秘書長，偽中政會副秘書長，僞宣傳部長，直至勝利爲止。</p>
<p>被告對起訴書答辯稱：被告對於抗戰素極擁護，「一二八」曾參加上海國難救濟會，抗戰後被告曾二次赴香港，籌備申報出版事務，後因先君生病返滬，汪精衛的我到愚園路二二六弄談話，受其誘惑，遂參加偽組織，因我非國民黨黨員，僞中政會係聘任委員，無事可做，會中僅僅人事報告及備案之例行公事而已。鐵路大權係操於敵華中鐵道公司之手，僞鐵道部無權過問，雖然想收回鐵路管理權，但敵方不同意，後來因僞鐵道部沒有工作可做，就裁撤了。調我當僞仃政院數務委員，這不過是下台後一個空名義，該院並無政務委員辦公室，亦從未到差。　市府秘書長任內所辦者爲秘書處之事務，原有各局長沒有更動。增加田賦，房捐，營業等稅收事，係由僞財政局直接簽呈僞市長，調卷宗亦即可查明。改訂敎科書係維新政府時代改訂，被告曾將公立學校改成私立，以避免採用此類敎科書，關於修築公路，便利敵人軍事運輸一節，當時僞府根本無款修築。辦理保甲並非限制地下工作人員活動，對地下工作人員打擊者均係敵憲密探。後調任偽中政會副秘書長，這是閒曹，亦無事可倣。三十四年二月　宣傳部長林柏生去職，被告改任僞宣傳都長，事先曾和軍委會徐特派員研究，得其允許，始行就職。因我自已有一個私人電台，與中央通消息，供給後方情報，有僞宣傳部長職務，可以掩護。</p>
<p>被告律師章士釗辯　稱：處理漢奸案件條例第三條：「協助抗戰工作或有利於人民之行爲，得减輕其刑」，被告私設電台，供給後方情報，已有陶廣，王堯欽等證人證明。被告於任僞市府秘書長任內，並無不利人民之行爲，不應問僞職之大小，而應該審察其行動，卞問僞下僞，只問好下奸，蹤不能諭知被告無罪，亦應减輕其刑。姚肇弟律師稱：請庭上注意被告犯罪之動機，事實，與事後之態度，在量刑方面要特別從寬。</p>
<p>審理至此，劉庭長宣佈：本案辯論終結，定本月二十四日上午宣判。</p>
<h3>地院開始大赦　昨首次釋放八十一人</h3>

<h3>酒業標會舞弊　公會函請制裁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市汾酒業同業公會理事長李佑才，及該會張澍恩，戴春風等，昨致函地檢處，略謂：勝利後標會風氣盛行，已波及本會會員，更因營業不振，不堪高利貸剝削，倒風大戰，糾紛迭起，受害會員請求公會調處，經調查結果，發覺彙康酒行。中國公司·大中華酒行·及陳照陽·胡伯圭·許少雲·王玉美等標得會款後，暗將款項寄回原籍置產，在滬僅留空店軀壳，作爲淸理倒賬工具。查同業中相互往來貸款會款有數十億元之鉅，被害者達三百餘家。此風不戢，勢將影響社會安寗。現經該會會議決定，會員中倘有將鉅款滙回原籍置產而居心在滬倒賬，或藉口欠賬，而將應付會款債款等故意停付或拖欠者，除由公會轉請市政府·參議會·社會局·警察局·市商會•地檢處等機關嚴厲制裁法辦外，並將登報公告云。</p>

<h3>鉛皮店內桃色血案　吹縐一池春水　竟遭殺身之禍　西施蒙不潔車夫不平　夥友管閑事原為失戀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕去年十二月十三日，凱旋路一九八號門前，發現無名男屍一具，當由該管長寗路分局派員將屍舁入騐屍所檢騐，後因並無家屬認領，即加收殮。茲悉死者名吳鐵根，年三十二歲，松江人，向在復興中路四四八號曹春生所設之曹立泰鉛皮店內爲夥計，已有十餘年之久。該店主曹春生於前妻亡故後，即姘識一婦人王氏，今年四十三歲，王氏前夫所生一女，名阿咪，由曹撫養長大，易名曹靜，現年十八歲，面貌美麗，有「鉛皮西施」之稱，吳鐵根向之追求，曾遭拒絕。該店隔壁，有魏長志所設之大餅店，魏之妻男趙福生，又名馬小福子，今年廿七歲，向踏三輪車度日，與靜感情頗佳，一日，適爲吳鐵根瞥見，醋心勃發，即報告曹母，將阿咪責打。從此以後，吳鐵根與趙福生即生嫌隙，趙福生並屢向吳恫嚇，要求强借現鈔一百萬元，口稱否則即置吳于死地。吳鐵根聞言大恐，四出借貸無着，不意竟被人謀斃於凱旋路安平寄柩所竹籬笆牆根之下。現爲吳鐵根之胞兄吳春才（年卅九歲現在七浦路五九六號中華學校任門房）所悉，將詳情貝報警局，當即派員將趙福生拘獲偵查，並具呈地檢處，要求將尸身覆騐。地檢處准詞覆騐，昨日上午，同仁輔元堂遂派夫役，將棺車回騐尸所。十一時檢察官沈佐才，偕法醫魏立功襲自惠等，蒞塲升坐公位，先向尸兄略詰一過後，即入騐尸所，命夫役先將尸棺開啓，取出尸身，法醫先將頭部解剖，將腦取出，當在該尸頭額骨發現黑斑點三處，又在後腦骨發現靑紫痕一處。旋又將胸部解剖，騐得心肺臟等完整無傷，檢騐歷二小時之久，始行完畢。當檢騐時，記者亦在塲旁觀，祇見尸身靑腫浮胖，臭氣四溢，狀甚可怖。據法醫稱，死者生前是否被人擊傷身死，抑或另有別情，須俟鑑定明晰後，再行具呈報告。該尸身現已由尸兄另購棺木收殮。</p>
<h3>汽油恐慌　業已消弭　配給說完全不確</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本週三四兩日，本市曾發生汽油恐慌，一時謠言紛起，有立即囤積者，有黑市出售者，價格　到五千元一加侖。據調查結果，其缺貨原因，乃因亞細亞及美孚二火油公司之進口許可證，未能按時領出。但昨日已恢復常態，被海關方面所封之油桶，亦已開封。惟因二日無油可加，各車待加者極爲擁擠，致一時不及應付。</p>
<p>該兩公司現正由浦東駁運大量汽油，經楊樹浦分送市區各油站。關於汽油進口，前曾經臨時輸入管制委員會列入限制進口貨項內，規定以政府及軍事機關有最優先權，汽油公司得最後機會，但供應汽油並不按配給制度，外傳將配給設完全不確。　又此次停給期內，德士古公司並不受任何影響，照常營業。</p>
<h3>永和實業有限公司　勞方越軌五人被拘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕永和實業有限公司，因年終獎金問題，發生之勞資糾紛，勞方代表童福奎，韋若虛，吳柏壽等五人，以越軌行動，包圍廠方，斷絕資方負責人飲食，阻擾工人復工，警備司令部於昨日將童等五人拘捕法辦。緣該公司設有二廠，共有工人四百餘名，於本月四日罷工，要求資方發給年賞三月，經社會局調解，令先復工，勞方未允。在此情形下，雙方繼續商談，勞方最後僅允减發兩天，談判終告破裂，社會局遂出面裁定。正當裁定之際，勞方於前日上午八時至下午三時包圍資方並斷絕資方飲食，强迫資方簽字發給兩月零二十八天之年賞金。吳市長，宜司令及吳局長聞訊，認童等越軌行動，除核准該公司開除童等五人外，並於昨日令飭警備司令部拘捕嚴辦。</p>
<h3>永安公司尼路糾紛　社會局調解中</h3>
<p>〔太報訊〕永安公司職工爲要求年賞問題，前日下午將行罷工時，由社會局勞工處樊科長振邦親臨該公司勸導勿作罷工行動。據悉：（一）該公司勞方要求年賞爲三十五天，資方允發三十天；（二）該公司職工薪給共分二十三級，勞方要求發給年終考級獎金，資方允將最低之一二三四等四級予以提高。據社會局樊科長對記者稱：上述兩項可望獲得雙方同意。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於永安公司職員向公司方面要求預支花紅事，茲悉：該公司職員於去年十二月，曾向公司要求年賞雙薪，公司當局經於去年十二月廿六日一律照發雙薪一月，茲職員又要求預支花紅，惟該公司認爲依據公司法，花紅需待年終決算完竣，經會計師核算及董事會議決，然後可照章辦理。但可通融先借薪水職員念萬元，練習生十五萬元，職員方面則堅持預支花紅一個半月。</p>
<h3>大美晚報　工潮解决</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市英文大美晚報排字房工人，於前日旣未與資方談判，亦示輕市政當局調解仲裁，擅自罷工，致前日該報未能發刊。但昨日已全都復工，照常出版。緣該報前已發給工人雙薪，作爲年終獎金，並援例預付一月份薪金半月。並定農曆元且休似一日，但工人又再度要求於農曆新年停刊七日，借薪三十萬元。館方以本市報業公會及市府當局對農曆新年休假本無規定，而年終借款亦無合理根據，故對此項要求堅予拒絕。</p>
<p>昨晨經印刷業總工會及市府當局調解，並嚴飭工人不應作如此無理要求後，勞方已予接受，開始復工。該館對此次工潮因工人未經合法步驟調解，先行罷工，故對罷工期間，各工人薪金一概不予發給。</p>
<h3>海上巡邏加緊　走私事件漸减</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據總稅務公署緝私科副稅務司司長陳長瑞談海關緝私情形稱，邇來上海方面，巡邏嚴密，走私事件漸少，華北沿海方面，則因商務未全恢復，走私事件，尚不多見。惟在華南一帶，水陸交通方便，海口亦多，故邇來華南走私之風較上海華北各口岸爲熾。目前行政院特准「海關暫行借調海軍艦艇指派關員駐艦查緝海軍或軍用船隻及軍人走私辦法」頒佈實行後，粵海關頃已有電報告緝獲某補給區司令部人員走私棉紗，香烟等私貨入口，其貨値數目甚大。該署已復電飭詳報緝獲情形及走私貨値。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕江海關緝私課，鑒於緝獲走私之沒收及罰鍰辦法，遠不如予走私犯以刑事處分之意義爲積極生效，近已建讓財歡部更改走私處分條例。此項條例已由該關緝司課副稅務司司長沈世堃草呈，俟經立法後即將公佈施行</p>

<h3>適合當前需要　新版關金劵發行後　市場反應極良好　一般日用價格無波動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新版關金劵發行後，昨日市塲反應，極爲良好。黃金晨開，雖曾一度騰漲，惟午收價已回平，午後更見疲軟。他如華股外鈔等，均頗平穩。一般物價，除日用品皂，燭，火柴等，以牛油，燒碱，硫酸等原料，原告缺乏，價格已連漲數日外，其他極少波動。一般公司行號之標價，亦未見　動。記者又探詢金融界人士意見，據上海銀行某負責人言，此次央行發行新劵，實為應付目前急關之用，致其對於物價人心之刺激，事實上自亦難免，刺激之程度，須視央行控制之有效與否而定，就今日而言，一般情形，頗稱良好，市面並未因此引起波動，今後之問題，即在中央銀行是否能繼續控制，以保持此種良好情形，新劵發行額，不宜過多，對黃金價格，應採有效措置，如新劵大量發行，每人袋中皆有新劵數張，則物價無形高漲，變所難免，目前我國通貨膨漲，已為不可諱言之事實，新券發行，僅其外觀之一種表現而已，另據錢業公會理事長沈日新言，大額新劵發行，在目前實爲一極自然之事實，一般人均感覺有此需要，且發行伊始，並未引起物價之波動，尤爲難得，預料相當時期以後，一般人對新版關金券，將「見怪不怪」云。此次發行之兩種新劵，大小相同，與原有之五元關金券相彷，圖案亦相同，二百五十元者爲淺棕色，五百元者爲藍色，美鈔公司印製，據票面標明，印製年份爲民十九年。</p>
<h3>金價雖一度提升　結果仍被壓回跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨央行仍加管制，高後即回，晨初以大票面關金之發行，業已證實，上塲即升至三七三萬有買，開後散買殷切，立形扳高，曾漲到三七九萬至三八一萬，央行頻加壓力，存多亦有了結，逐漸回跌，十時後，央行以三七一萬之價，配給一四〇條，入後曾破入三七〇萬大關內，低價兌三六九萬，午刻站三七二萬左右，午後隔日交割又哄到三七九萬，央行再供千餘條，最後復屈居三七〇萬內，較前收跌落一萬，飾金掛低少許爲三十九萬元，銀元亦稍跌，暗拆銀垠微緊，息價在一角半强。　外幣昨未見精彩，美鈔暗盤晨初六千五至六千六，午刻退至六千四左右，午後金價雖昂，鈔市仍難振作，未獲進展，結果較前收徵降五十元，港票仍無榮辱，港匯亦仍在一二二〇元至一二三〇元間有成交，印匯一四八〇元至一五〇〇元，英匯一九七〇〇元有供。</p>
<h3>公債閑散</h3>
<p>公債昨仍告閑散，統丙晨開二二〇〇元，五五二室有納，升至二二五〇元，五〇三室則賣，步降至二〇二〇元，最後在二〇五〇元至二一〇〇元間徘徊，結果較前收計甲乙戊各升五十元，而丁平平。</p>

<h3>商業銀行六家　臨時代收稅款　便利市民納稅</h3>
<p>本市市銀行代理公庫，經收各項稅捐規費等款，早在本市各區分設收款總分處卅二所，專辦收解事宜。現在本市營業稅，房捐及市政建捐等，業已開征，茲聞該行爲便利市民繳納稅款起見，除由九江路總行及原設各收款處總分處繼續收解外，所有該行愚園路二四七號第一辦事處，老西門中華路一四五〇號第二辦事處，中正東路（大世界西）五〇九號第三辦事處均照收，同時該行以市區遼闊，納稅人衆，仍恐納稅市民猶有擁擠久候，跋涉不便之感，爰自本年起，復經臨時委託浙江興業銀行總行（江西路二三〇號），浙江興業銀行東門路支行（東門路六一—六三號），新華銀行第六辦事處（中正中路四五一號），四明銀行南京路支行（南京東路四七〇號），中國實業銀行曹家渡分行（康定路四五一號）四行儲蒂會（南京西路一七〇號），中國通商銀行楊樹浦辦事處（漁市塲）分別代收之</p>
<h3>農曆年關前　或收購秋絲　葛敬中晋亦接洽</h3>

<h3>業中人談　蛋價飛漲原因　年關逼近需要增加　資金缺乏無法周轉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者以兩週來蛋價飛漲幾逾一倍，特向蛋業中人探詢實情，據悉：最近蛋價之波動，主因在供不應求。本市鷄鴨蛋主要來源，有漢口，蕪湖，南京，蘇北，溫州，杭州等地。去年十一月下旬，至十二月初旬，因各蛋行向各地收貨，大量擁到，形成供過於求。各蛋行十九均屬小規模紐織，資金有限。且鮮蛋之最長保藏期，亦僅三週。故均不惜貶價傾銷，虧蝕頗鉅。職是之故，蛋行近來遂少向各地收貨。而產地鄉農，以乏人收貨，亦多將所產蛋品自行消費。致邇來產區可供採購之貨少，價則增高。反之，本市以農曆年關逼近，需要激增，而供給則日减，各蛋行存底枯薄，遂形成蛋價高漲。據悉：戰前蛋價平穩，緣有大型蛋廠，居間調劑盈虛。大型蛋廠資本雄厚，備貨充足，又有冷藏設備。遇各蛋行供不應求，及來源不暢時，即設法供應。今因缺乏大型蛋廠，居間調節，而一般蛋行，又均囿於資金，遂釀成缺貨則全體缺貨，過剩則全體過剩之畸形現狀，深望關係當局能注意及之，設法改進。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市顏料業，去年營業情形甚佳，一般人均目爲「發財」，記者昨特往訪顏料公會負責人，據云本市顏料業，表面上雖有發財之目，而實際頗感苦悶，苦悶之原因，即爲來源缺乏，與存貨空虛。去年一年來銷售之顏料，幾全爲德孚洋行淸理處拍得之貨品，銷售利潤，亦僅百分之二十，一般顏料行因感利潤低微，每有屯積顏料，等待漲價之事，而資金較小之商行，則因頭寸　不轉，受高利貸壓迫而倒閉者，亦有十數家之多，故發財與吾，亦須視資金厚薄與存貨多少爲定，未可一概而論也，顏料業商人因感顏料爲多種工業之必須品，故曾聯合進出口業向輸入管理委員會請求，將顏料列入不限額輸入品之例，惟至今未蒙批准，而以前向美方定購之顏料，目前運到者數量極微，該業曾設法到香港採辦英國顏料，亦因供不應求，所獲甚少，故目前本市顏料業，頗有「虛胖」之情形，一因該業貨品，皆由外國供給，目前不僅輸入受限制，而英美等國本身之顏料業，亦多未復元，故此「虛胖」之情形，深堪憂虛云。</p>

<p>市體育館主辦之毓琇籃球盃中等學校籃球聯賽，於昨日下午三時在該館召開第一次聯賽委員會議，出席者邵汝幹，金兆均，蔣湘靑，王微君，張葆奎，周家騏（邵代），周濬（張代），吳子彬（姚代）胡宗藩，龔師聲，姚榮隄等，主席邵汝幹，當將規程通過，並決議定三月八日揭幕，報名二月廿日起至廿八日止。</p>
<h3>送埠際足球代表隊</h3>
<p>參加滬港埠際足球賽的本市代表隊將於明日出發，我們除對代表隊抱着高度的熱望，並且相信代表隊一定能　其心力，以奪得錦標歸來外，我們同時願意提出兩點意見，作爲贈言。</p>
<p>埠際賽的終極目的，不是錦標的得失，而是兩個不同地方，利用運動比賽的方法，來觀摩技術，聯絡情誼。因此我們參加埠際賽，固然希望得到公平的勝利，更希望能達到終極目的。這種希望是寄託在高尚的精神和技術表演中。比賽的勝負，有幸有不幸，如果我們的精神和技術表演得很好，雖不幸而敗，猶屬光榮。不然的話，即使我們幸而得勝，銀盃上刻的字，決抵不了幾千幾萬觀衆心目中所刻的印像。這種不良印像，也要等到第二次埠際賽在港舉行時，有很好的表演能奪回的。</p>
<p>埠際賽是更大結合的準備和基礎。雖然埠際代表隊中有不少外人參加，國人究佔多數。足球的技術水準，以滬港二埠爲最高，我們參加世運會的代表，滬港二地一定佔得大部份位子。我們要放遠眼光，看到未來的責任和義務，同心合力爲國爭光的責任和義務。今天雖然在球塲上處於對立的兩方面，日後還是站在一條戰綫上的同志，因此更要互相愛護，互相接近，以爲將來携手合作的準備。我們希望滬港兩地中華國籍的球員，在比賽以後，能有一個痛快的集會，大家坦白眞誠而和愛地研究技術，增進情誼，建立一個很好的基礎。</p>
<p>敬祝埠際足球代表諸公一路平安，載譽歸來。（偉）</p>

<h3>膠濟铁路全線行</h3>
<p>— 濟南十日航訊本報特派員麗天</p>
<p>東行第一大站與大橋</p>
<p>也許由於膠濟沿線所有車站什九被共軍破壞的緣故，這「幸免於難」的濟南火軍站，在記者的直賢和記憶中，便成了全國比較美麗的車站之一。站屋的設計雖還够不上稱富麗宏偉，但以不同形式，寬宏合度，富有中古藝術意味，排列在濟南最繁盛的商埠區北面的三座洋樓，其中一座且包有五層高聳雲際的鐘樓樓尖，遠望去，實富有無限畫意和詩情。</p>
<p>記者於六日侵晨　着寒風踏上這美麗的車站，站上的旅客正排着三條長的十餘丈的行列在三個不同的窗口循着次序購買車票。行旅雖多，但絲毫沒有一點紊　或爭先恐後的氣氛。寥落的幾位憲警在站上懶散地兜來轉去顯着無精打采的神情，道種較京滬等地車站秩序遠為良好的情形初看了使記者不勝驚異，但由後來所目擊到每個車站不僅購票上車，就是下車出站時，都是魚貫前進井然有序的情形，使記者才瞭然社會敎育的重要。為了便於檢查往來行旅及其身份證，民衆都已很自然地養成了這項好習慣。</p>
<h3>受內亂影響較少　膠濟線還算完整</h3>
<p>本來，膠濟綫的修築是導源於光緒廿三年（一八九七）德國以山東德籍敎士兩名被害為藉口，出兵佔我膠州灣，並要求建築由膠澳至濟南府及由濟南至山東界之鐵路。光緒廿五年（一八九九）八月開始興築，至光緒卅年（一九〇四）六月遂完成今日之膠濟綫及張店博山支綫。此綫因由德國所築，故主權始終操於德人之手。至民國三年第一次歐洲戰起，日乃利用參戰名養，於十一月予以侵佔，直至歐戰結束後三年（民國十一年）十一月，幾經折衝及交涉，才由我接管。廿六年抗戰軍與，韓復渠不戰而退，遂於同年十二月又人敵手，直至卅四年九月日軍投降，二次大戰勝利結束，我才於同年十月廿九日正式又自敵手接收過來。</p>
<p>在過去，膠濟綫雖飽經外患，但因受內亂的影響較少，故與國內其他路綫相較，還算是比較最整齊的一條。自我於卅四年十月廿九日由日本手中接管以後，膠濟路在共軍毫無休止的破壞攻擎中也就經歷了它有史以來最慘酷的命運，雖由路局隨破隨修，無如隨修隨毀，破壞日益擴大，終且修不勝修。直至去年六月，王司令官佐民率領籍銳親臨指揮，於十月十日將全錢打通，陳局長舜畊隨之以作戰精神。指揮搶修，終於十二月十二日接軌修通，十六日全錢正式通車，本年一月六日起且加開當日到達的濟脊間直達特別快車。</p>
<p>根據路局統計，膠濟路幹支綫總長為四六一公里，但自政府接收至去年十二月十二日的四〇九天中，總計：</p>
<p>（一）軌道：前後被共軍破壞的達九四九次，（平均每兩天破壞幾達五次），如以長途累計，則共達三九四。二八五公里，佔該線總長六分之五。</p>
<p>（二）鋼軌：損失四一，三七七根，枕木三一九，八七三根；魚尾板九四，〇六八塊；螺栓一七六，四〇〇個，道釘一·二六九，〇九九個。</p>
<p>（三）橋樑：被破壞三〇三次，計二三〇座。</p>
<p>（四）站房：被破壞九二次，共四十四站，合五五，二九〇平方公尺。</p>
<p>（五）給水設備：被破壞十四次，共十四處。</p>
<p>（六）號誌：被破壞六八次。</p>
<p>（七）電綫設備；被破壞三〇一次，共計電桿八，三六四根，電綫八，三一三，五九七公尺。</p>
<p>（八）車輛：被破壞二〇四輛</p>
<p>（九）修復時計共費人工二十七萬九九千四百二十七工。幾乎等於重築新路所應需用的工料及工數。　這個數字還不够龐大嗎？共軍此種漫無止境的戕賊，國家元氣和生命的破壤作風，實下知其居心究又何在？</p>
<h3>在癱瘓狀態中　完成通車奇蹟</h3>
<p>記者所乘是濟南到坊子的尋常快車，所謂尋常快車，實際上仍是逢站必停車。車於最八時一刻離站前駛，除三等車廂稍有站立仍無座位者外，初無如京滬綫上乘客擠得形同逃難的普通特快車。但此綫也並不就是說毫無缺點，行車的遲緩和顚簸的劇烈使我回想到「戰時湘掛路剛剛通車的情形。同車的一位旅客笑着向我說：「現在已經好得多。每小時可以走廿多公里了！以前簡直是牛車！」另一個說：「有一個時期簡直是搖籃，車身動　得使我們目眩神昏。」記者以前沒有乘過，無從比較，但即就目下情形而論，已不難想見當初共軍破壞之重與路局搶修之苦了！</p>
<p>膠濟路原為國內除滇越路外僅有的鋼枕路，但路軌下的鋼枕架於勝利前早被敵盜運一空，勝利後又因共軍的不斷破壞，材料補充困難，乃多由其他各鐵路綫剩餘材料權中且撥用，於是德式，英式，日本式，三十公斤，三十七公斤，四十一，四十二，四十三等公斤的鋼軌便色色俱全，樣樣都有，而至數十餘種之多，簡一直成了鋼軌展覽會。鋼軌輕重高一低旣不一，扣合鋼軌的魚尾板又一係土製，異性魚尾板旣無法使用一，且更有以木質代替者。加以每一常進站前原皆用十號，岔子，現因十號缺貨，改用八號，在這層層疊疊的困難條件下，膠濟綫能由癱瘓狀態中恢復通車，實在不能說不是奇蹟。</p>
<h3>鐵橋被炸得倒歪　傷痕斑剝不忍覩</h3>
<p>由濟南經歷城，郭店，龍山至棗園寺間，所有房舍大致尙均修整完好，自棗園寺再前進（張店除外）惟見黃沙一片，樹少人稀，所有房舍，幾被全毀，斷垣頹壁，，觸目皆是。軌道兩側護路壕隨軌道蜿蜒東向，漫無止境。路側電桿，俱係旣細矮且彎曲的各式樹桿雜凑而成，而一堆堆被打碎的電桿磁瓶在陽光下尚不時發凌亂的閃爍。大部鐵橋。更被炸得東倒西歪，傷痕斑斑，乘置河畔，不忍卒視。路側平均每隔數十步必有掩蔽體一個，每隔一公里，必有堅固琱堡一座（每逢橋樑，則兩端各為一座）琱堡四週，或附築小堡壘三四，小堡壨外，並有深約丈餘壕塹，壕塹內滿釘木刺，壕外圍以樹枝或鐵絲綱，如此凡三層，而道旁纍纍坵墓極目難數，其間土色煥然猶新者，亦屬不少。枯樹寒鴉，斷碑殘碣，使記者宛如身臨塞北重讀了一篇「弔古戰塲文」。</p>
<p>九時廿五分車抵張店，這是濟南車行以來的第一大站。四十公、里的淄博支綫交會於此，它不僅是淄博煤產的呑吐口，同時因該地盛產鋁　，亦為國內有名的輕金屬出產地。在敵偽侵佔期間，嘗於此設輕金屬開發公司，規模宏大，工人最多時達四萬餘人，戰事結束前敵並計劃在此設立一飛機製造廠，旋因投降，乃吿中止。勝利後該廠由資委會接收，但直到現在，據說機器尙在睡眼狀　中正生着銹。</p>
<h3>第一在橋十個孔　六個遭共軍破壞</h3>
<p>由張店東向三站為辛店，在辛店與淄河店之間，為全綫第一大橋之淄河橋。橋長三百五十公尺，凡十孔，因遭共軍破壞，已毀其六。路局以六千根枕木作井字形累疊以代橋墩，載重大減，車以最慢的速度蠕蠕駛過時，還可聽到橋墩上壓得吱吱咂咂的聲響。　附近原有溫泉，據路局工程人員談稱，戰前泉水甚旺，抗戰八年間一直斷流，直到我搶修人員前來修橋時，泉水突又潺潺流出，且泉流遠較過去為旺，鄉人奇之，故咸謂天佑中華，溫泉復活，路局正計劃着於戰亂平靜後築一大規模溫泉賓館及浴室，以供旅客前往膏沐。</p>
<p>下午四時二十分抵　縣，這膠濟綫中部的第一大站。車於今天的終點站原是離此二十餘公里的坊子（為策安全，膠濟綫迄今尙未開設夜車），但因明天東開的快車仍以濰縣作起點，我們使決定利用此時機，拜會駐櫛此間的夏總司令楚中後，明晨再繼續東進。</p>
<h3>還鄉專車急行聲中　看滬杭線經濟</h3>
<p>— 杭州十二日訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>春節將到了，這條江南的大動脈—滬杭綫，又須盡它載送游子還鄉的責任。從上海開出的每一次車，總是擠得滿地，相反的，從杭州開出的每一次車，顯得冷淡多了。路局為了便利還鄉，特加開「還鄉專軍」，在晚上十時由上海北站開出，到深夜三時始到城站，行路的人眞够艱苦的，但難不住游子思鄉之念，還是一車子一軍子的把游子們載回浙江來。</p>
<p>難道還是「鄉音無改鬢毛衰嗎？」有許多在家鄉外面掙扎的人，鬢毛是衰白了，但鄉音日也是改觀了。我們這一羣游子，十九都可以說是由農村社會中生長的，而今天的農村，已到達不堪言不忍言的境地。把者持在春節蒞臨的前夜，到滬杭綫兩旁的城村中漫步，深感農會如果不再切實想辦法，則中國這一點點立國的根本也將吹了。</p>
<p>斗米換不到兩斤肉</p>
<p>在滬杭沿綫的農村中，都有「斗米三斤肉」的俗語，言其農人以一斗米可向城市換取三斤猪肉的意思。現在滬杭綫上的米價，上米大槪四萬五六千元一担至五萬餘元一担，而猪肉每斤要三千六百元至三千八百元之數，則以每斗米價　千六百至五千元，尙換不到兩斤肉。這個比例相差太遠了。而且，一畝田的耕耘播植，是煞費苦心的，平均每畝可收穫數約為一石六七斗，人工大槪要二千元一工供膳，本錢總要在八斗米的樣子，則本錢已去收穫量的半數。</p>
<p>晨胞們窮困的多富庶的少，大半富庶的晨胞已做了坐享利益的地主，這千千萬萬貧窮的農胞，原無法來投資於田地的。於是向富戶們借款，去年春交之間，借一石米要還一右五斗，甚至有二石的農戶除還債去本錢之外，還需要負祖大戶被派的糧與稅，剩下來的，不知幾兩肉還買得到買不到？「斗米三斤肉」，是變成了玄想，能够換得一斤肉已歡天喜地的了。</p>
<p>近年來，農胞們圖糊口還不足，更那裏有餘錢來復興自己的家園？所以農舍敗壞，農具也枵損了，衣服更不想添製新的好的。</p>
<p>農貸應擊退高利貸</p>
<p>雖然政府推行「二五」减租，但「租」是「租」，而「債」還是「債」，「債」的負担可以呌人壓死，高利貸在滬杭綫的農村中任情的施展着，它榨乾了農村僅餘的一點水，它盤剝了農村中僅餘的一點金融活動。農貸萬萬元，果然好聽又響亮，但農胞們熱切的盼望着放農貸的人能夠高移貴步，多多到農村中的農舍裹，不要嫌他們髒汚，問問他們實際的情形，到底受到了幾貸的多少實惠？到底農貸的力量是否已把高利貸的毒燄殺減了？還是高利貸的威風勝過了農貸？我聽農胞說：「農貸是不是膿蛋？」又有人說，「手績太麻煩了。」我想主辦農貨的人，當不是貸了就了事。更不是貸了後不管澈底不澈底就了事。而是要一分錢，晨胞得着一分錢的好處。一角錢，農胞得着一角錢的實惠。道才算主辦晨貨者完盡了責任。</p>
<p>鄉汛竟變成淡月了</p>
<p>滬杭綫上的城市，事實上是靠着農村而繁興的，城市裹的寓公們至少有幾畝田，靠着租米過安閒日子，城市裏的商店，一面以奢侈消費品賣與寓公們，一面以普通消費品賣與農胞，所謂「鄉汛」的時期，各家店舖，莫不利市三倍，而其「鄉汛」之期，總在秋收以後。夏天正是農忙，乃是淡月，不信可到滬杭綫上各城市一調查，便知夏末秋初，各商店大事囤貨，以備秋末與冬季脫售。農胞們在冬天一到，就要準備過年，殺猪宰鷄，醃魚臘肉，購辦年貨，以表崇敬菩薩保佑和上祖所賜的意思，最後才自己人大嚼大喝一頓。今年農村太不景氣，租米和債務都差一點要還不了，怎有錢來大事過年？因着農村的不景氣”形成了商業的空前蕭條，本來熱鬧的「鄉汛」，却變成了冷淡的日子。</p>
<p>預測北大街倒風盛</p>
<p>從滬杭綫這一條大動眠上看，比較大的城市計有三個，一為嘉興，二為松江，三為硤石，這三處城市都在窘迫中，許多商店都在搖搖欲倒，嘉興有一爿七十多年的老店，是在同治年間所創設的，名呌順泰牲磁蔴號，規模相當的大，但在春節前倒閉了。硤石有一家向稱油業先進的裕記油行，永豐藥材行，永茂興麵粉號都相率倒閉，松江當也不能例外，也有幾家停歇，研究他們倒閉的原因，當不外貸款的利息過高，脫貨滯遲，開支浩大，售出貨物的價格不抵進貨的價格。同時像在嘉興這樣的地方，各家商店都裝飾門面，所耗甚鉅。原意想裝飾門面後，在冬季可以顯一顯身手，那裏知道冬季淸淡不堪，奄無辦法，裝璜費一筆無從開支。嘉興這一次順泰姓的倒閉，價在二萬萬元以上，記者寫此稿時，又據確息，嘉興的一爿很大的綢布號久和又倒閉了，價在一萬萬三千萬元以上。另外倒閉的甚多，有人預測說春節前後，道本來熟鬧的北大街，將變成凄淸冷寂，這本來難覓一枝橈的北大街將有很多店面空出來。　滬杭沿綫各城市的蕭條冷寂，間接表示了農胞的窮困不堪，他們買不起，用不起東西，影響所及，店家便只有倒閉之一途了。　還鄉，還鄉，願游子們看看自己的家園，想想家園何以荒蕪至此。游子們是懷鄉的，怎樣使自己的家鄉復興起來呢？</p>
<h3>越南　在苦鬥中　從南到北</h3>
<p>— 一月一日航訊　潔蓀寄自河內</p>
<p>在法國接收暹越邊境的馬德望，披汶堪頌，針巴塞，瀾滄四府的前一天，記者來到了馬德望。這四府中的首府，也就是四府中的最富庶之區，自從命運決定它重歸法國統治之後，商店閉門，居民紛紛遷避離境，倐地從繁華熱鬧變為荒凉冷落了。</p>
<p>高大的建築物都被高綿革命黨人縱火燒燬，橋樑，鐵道也都遭受破壞。法軍向各府推進，受着革命黨人的偷襲，傷亡纍纍。在馬德望，在舉行接受典禮的那一天，法方本來是預備有所舖張，以表示「歡迎」和「慶祝」的，但是，居民遷選的遷選，其餘的也都閉戶不出，結果，只有幾個受僱而來的貧民在街上搖旗呼口號，當是這接收典禮中的一種點縐。</p>
<p>到了湄公河的一條支流之畔，我們正在預備乘桴渡河，忽而法機盤旋飛到，我們連忙散開伏地，而到終有兩人，一男一女死在機關槍的掃射之下。法機旣去，我撫視死者，也不禁為之一掬傷悼之淚，而同行的越南靑年，只是看看就咬急牙根，握着拳頭，不再稍稍回顧的往前就走。這又是一個多麽動人的鏡頭！</p>
<p>半日到太平。這是一個雀治，有法越軍除共駐其間。過此則公路尙還元好，我乘越盟軍車而往南定。南定也是省治，介於河內，海防之間的交通綫的中心點，地位重要；半面臨河，風景也很幽美。建築物的宏偉壯麗，以北圻來說，僅次於河內和順化。一間紡織廠，規模之大，可以說是越南第一。　南定有華僑兩千多人。處在法越局勢極度險惡的情形之下，誰都人人自危，不可終日。他們看見我，有越盟軍隊護送，法兵又不干涉和留難，以為是我國政府派來的什麼大員，於是　集探間，祖國政府對於越南華僑，到底採取什麽方針？我答不出話來，只是感動得掉下眼淚。到了熟識我的朋友們見到我，他們說及在越南的僑胞今後的處境，竟至放聲痛哭。祖國是太對不起僑胞了！</p>
<p>越盟軍隊　實踐孤軍奮鬥</p>
<p>越盟軍隊一向駐在南定市中心，法兵駐在市皮，東方匯理銀行南定分行則由法越軍隊共同守衛。是我到了南定的第二天，守衛東力匯理銀行南定分行的法兵忽而攻擊越兵，大規模的衝突因之以起。槍聲不絕，砲彈橫飛，市民死傷，為數不知多少。我就混戰中應越盟方面之勸請，從市區退到近郊的越盟軍司令部去。</p>
<p>司令是個中年人，曾經留居中國多年，說得一口流利的國語和廣東話。我以越盟軍隊的裝備的來源和接濟為問，他說：「完全靠我們自己奮鬥，也可以說是我們是孤軍奮鬥，沒有人給過我們以接濟，我們也不想到此時會有人給我們以什麽接濟。我們有的是滿腔熱血，我們和我們的父母已經做了奴隸，不能讓我們的子孫再做奴隸了。</p>
<p>我又問及越盟對於華僑維持的態度，他隨怒宣讀越盟方面發表的致華僑書；「……吾人深明獨立之中國實為亞洲之和平及越南安寗之一保話，中越友誼乃兩民族間的必然效果。君等須知，越南人方為君等在越南利害之唯一保衛者，而此項利益之必要的及充分的保證，則為越南之獨立與自由。」最後，他並且强調的說：「我們已經命令我們的部隊，切實保護華僑。同時，我們也希望中國友人，不要誤信法方離間利挑唆的陰謀。」</p>
<p>越盟軍隊，不分官兵，每月薪餉僅越幣六元，糙飯粗菜，也都官兵一律。他們很關心中國對於越南的態度，常常請我講述中國現况，而由其司令做繙譯。我在司令部住居五天，備受禮遇和優待。到了離南定經河內，又派官兵多名相伴護送。</p>
<p>法越雙方　進行緊急戒備</p>
<p>鐵道綫上所有的鐵橋，都在戰爭期中為盟機炸燬，日本投降後，曾經草草修理，勉強通車，現在又為　盟毀壞了。只有公路尚有局部可以通車。沿途居民加緊疏散，也加緊建築防衛之事。法機也不時飛去轟炸，襲擊。</p>
<p>自從海防和各地衝突事件發生之後，河內的法越雙方，都在緊急戒備之中。街道荒凉冷落，商店閉門休業；戰穴到處都是，政府機開和各重要建築物，也都裝置沙袋和佈滿鐵絲網。法越雙方軍民不進互舞手榴彈，互相槍擊。情形是滿目恐怖，一片混亂。</p>
<p>此其間，會經有過一個時期，法國駐越北專員森泰尼，曾經向法越雙方進行斡旋工作但是，正如越盟方面的報紙所說；「由於反動派殖民地主義者具有堅決征服意志之故，所以，沒有見其有些微的成功。」　也有過一個時期，法越雙方都在注視着法　政府主席選舉之結果。越盟約「　國日報」稱：「姑無論是右派常權，抑或左派得勢，越南民族始終維持其原有的立塲，越民族經常準備歡迎支持越南民族獨立與團結之法人，更經常準備，渠有力抵抗侵犯主權之征服陰謀及蠶食之舉動。」「民族報」也稱：「如其仍將印度支那事務委諸高級專員，（按二即達尙禮安上將）則法越問之戰爭勢將不可避免。」</p>
<p>法政府對越南的態度旣經明白表示，「救國日報」又說：「自今始，吾人常準備長期抵抗，吾人更當準備，蹈進更堅決之階段。吾人下應詢問戰爭何時終了，寧謐何時降臨，吾人只當今後進入長期作戰之階段，而此次戰爭必須俟法殖民主義之反動份子之征伐仃動失敗，始告完結。」</p>
<p>法機出動　胡志明以身免</p>
<p>到了十二月十七日，情形就更險惡，大規模的戰爭也就終於爆發。法機令隊出動助戰，大砲聲；機關鎗聲，炸彈聲，震耳欲聾。雙方及華越人民，死傷枕籍，街上陳屍纍纍。越盟相府及胡志明官邸，經過劇烈的巷戰後，終被法兵攻陷。據越盟秘密電台擴播，胡志明僅以身免，外决黃永鑑則受重傷。</p>
<p>至今有近半月了，法方宜稱，加策從事掃蕩，越盟則據市中心區，堅決抵抗。我國駐西貢總領哀子健提議華僑區設立中立地帶，法駐越北軍司令慕里哀曾經表示同意。然而，這所謂中立地帶也者，並不獲得尊重。華僑生命財產的損失已屬無法統計。最悲慘的是。有兩個年紀未滿二十的華僑少女。被法兵擄去輸姦後，氣息僅屬。復收刺刀插入下部致死，使人不忍卒睹。</p>
<p>海外僑胞，有如無吿的孤兒，戰前任人宰割，任人魚肉，戰後仍是聽人作牛馬，任人屠殺。邏京大流血，荷印大流血，越南大流血，還是天天在流着。祖國是太對不起他們了！</p>
<p>在越南的法國軍政大員，有殖民部長莫特，遠東軍總司令華尼，駐越南高級專員達尙禮安等。不時來往於西貢河內之間，舉行會議。或是指揮軍事。莫特說：「越南經過許多兇暴事件後，當然不能和越南黨人成立協議。」達尙禮安說：「在越南人民改進之現階段，法國不欲准許彼等以不條件之獨立。」在法國本國政府也正式宣吿，決以武力對付越南，法兵正在源源東調，法國總理萊勃倫為一社會主義者，動輒發表人道之政見，這次也贊許武力對付越南民族主義者。是故戰爭蔓延已經幾遍整個越南。在今後的日子　越南的血鬥，勢必愈加慘列了！</p>

<h3>福州人對米發愁</h3>
<p>— 八日航訊　本報福州特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>家家戶戶掛上了民國卅六年的日曆，市街上貼着慶祝新年，慶祝憲法頒佈的紅紅綠綠的標語，雖然，福州市民傳統習慣上仍然相當重視舊曆年，但是新曆年給他們也是一個新的感覺和一番熱鬧。特別是今年元旦，福州各界為了慶祝民國卅六週年暨憲法成立的兩重意義，情緒似比往年來得熱烈。</p>
<p>新年慶祝過後，大家安靜下來，迎候新歲報佳音，這個佳音是：福州糧價高陞三級，六萬，八萬，跳過九萬元。福州人收歛了新年的歡笑，鎖着雙肩在計算着如何度過舊曆年關。</p>
<p>隨着糧價的堅挺，百物各價也都乘機改價了，一句話：物價造成低氣壓—升斗小民透不過氣來。</p>
<p>兩個月以前，福州米價每石徘徊於六萬元左右，而且那時又値秋收之時，一般人的估計，糧價一定可以安定一時，勞苦貧民，公敎人民對此都抱着無窮希望，可是，好景不常，曾幾何時糧價自元且起不數天高漲三分之一有餘，以目前情形觀察，糧價仍有再漲之勢，愈迫年關，問題也愈嚴重。</p>
<p>記者為此特走訪福州市長嚴靈峯及市府糧食調劑處負責人，叩詢對於目前福州糧價有何抑制辦法以安定民生。據云福州米糧主要靠閩北產米縣份的運濟，其次，來自溫州，上海各地的海米，近來，以年關在邇，各地米的進口不無受到一些影響，而且，米商的囤積觀望，消費者的購買過年米等現象，皆足以激起糧價的波動，市府糧食調劑處因此開放其所屬十個分佈於市區各地的配售站，以低於市價的四分之一的米配售予貧戶，藉此實施平抑，此外，辦理糧食登記，禁止出口，取締囤積居奇等等，而且，最近復派員到蕪湖採購大批食米，計劃眞是堂乎皇哉，而市上的米價，則如烈火般在燃燒在蔓延。遠水難救近火！</p>
<p>福州有近四十萬的人口，據官方統計日需二千餘祖米糧，福州的存糧到底多少，沒有調查統計，市府的糧調處這幾天來據云每日以低價拋出數百担食米以供平　，談不上治本，即言治標，收效亦甚低微。市府似乎拿不出一套根本辦法以取締囤積居奇操縱糧食市塲的米奸商；又沒有必要的手段—控制着大批的糧食（據市府糧調處負責人吿記者該處經常控制之糧食多則四五萬担，少則一萬担）</p>
<p>現在福州的社會經濟，已經頻臨到空前的危機—如具有規模的福電鐵工廠與福州電汽公司，皆以原料缺乏，銷路停滯，虧累不堪而將吿停工，福電鐵工廠為我國東南半壁唯一這鐵工廠，向能製造蒸汽機，水力機，汽油機及工作母機以供東南各省工業之用，今亦無法支持，僅此足以窺知福州工商業今日到了如此的凋敝狀態。勞資兩方的糾紛亦時有所聞，如果，在整個社會不景氣聲中，「米一的間題亦無一個具體解決辦法，强者身眞溝壑，強者被迫挺而走險，社會將形成騷動與不靖局面。歷代的變亂，不少是起于米的恐慌與幣制的紊亂，豈容忽視。</p>
<p>茲聞國大閩籍代表，以福州糧食問題日趨嚴重，特聯名向中央請求就中央向本省征實征借撥作軍糧之糧米免除，留價調劑本市糧食之用，這當然是一個好消息。不過，徒此仍不足以抑低福州的米價。</p>
<p>供需的調劑，糧商的管理與夫市府對於糧食的控制是解決福州糧食恐慌的辦法。市府不妨大刀闊斧地予囤積居奇的糧奸商以嚴懲。兩州為福建首善之區，福州的市政設施，有資格價為本省政治的考核標準，省政府亦應以緊急措置令閩北各縣火速運米接濟，以安定人心。</p>
<p>冬深了，春天已不在遠。福州人哆嗉在嚴冬裏，他們希望春天帶來春訊，給他們消解米愁。</p>

<h3>陰间難過</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>『舊曆年年禁，年年過奮年，舊年年難過，年復又一年。』</p>
<p>這苜詩初看頗像打油，其實寥寥二十字，正寫盡了『過年』這一件事的因果源流，酸甜苦辣。、</p>
<p>你以爲我是在胡扯嗎？且看，有事實爲證：</p>
<p>豬肉連日因爲需要激增，已狂漲到每担三十六萬元；食油爲了大量供給市銷，市政府已在考慮撥配植物油廠存油五千石，以謀壓平市價；典當業結算在邇，加高利息，縮短當期，盈餘因之倍蓰，高踞百業之上。這是爲什麼？大家都要過舊曆年！</p>
<p>麵粉配售需要孔亟，各粉廠特為中入洋粉四萬八千包，調劑需求；四聯總處生產貸款最近先核准七千億，申請者仍擁擠不堪，所以星期日也衹好照常辦公。這是爲什麼？也還是因爲大家要過舊年。</p>
<p>京滬綫十六日起增開專車一列，號日「還鄉專車」；各學校提前放寒假，名爲「早日結束」；機關法團休息幾天，稱之〔春節」；警局加崗巡邏，備形緊張，呌做「年關戒備」；總結一句，又何嘗不是爲了大家都要過舊年？</p>
<p>雉妓活動頻繁，已侵入熱鬧市區；大赦後囚犯出獄，慈善家正紛紛捐助冬衣；郵差需索酒資，局方已事前告誡；公務員不准跳舞，市府正重申禁令；陽曆年那裏會有這許多花樣？</p>
<p>陽歷雖經百方提倡，而舊曆年盛况始終不衰，儘管「陰關」比「陽關」難過，但大家並下因此而减少一點掙扎過關的勇氣與興趣，就這樣年復一年，由生至死，唯陰曆年似乎總是每個人生命史上不可或缺的點綴與裝飾，事實俱在，一目了然！</p>
<p>在這裹也可以看出我們的一點道德情操來：天地間任何一件事都逃不出「厭舊喜新」的通例，而我們却能一反其道，對「新」的年似睬非睬，皮裏陽秋，但對付「舊」的年可大大不同了，鑼鼓喧天，爆竹震地，桃符萬戶，香烟錄褫，顯得多麼熱烈！多麼眷戀！古典式的誡樸，夢幻般的執着；我們是道樣地在「舊」的東西裏面追求慰藉，發掘希望！誰說人心不古，世道云亡？</p>
<p>不過也有一點遺憾的是：駡路上一邊在大吹大擂的减價錢賣，而一邊貼鄰已黏上了宣告淸理的律師告白。上海舉竟是靠生意人撑起來的都市，所以這樣一來，舊曆年就未免覺到掃興得多了。</p>
<p>正是；</p>
<p>生意興隆？凍死蟹！</p>
<p>財源茂盛！搭訕殭。</p>
<h3>也談借雨傘</h3>
<p>— 邵甄龢</p>
<p>讀「話說銀行家」後</p>
<p>序曲</p>
<p>話說銀行家一文開頭即引用一位文學家對銀行家所下的定義，說銀行家是：「晴天他借雨傘給你，等到下雨天，他就把雨傘收回。」下文接著就是作者自己發揮的叙議。筆調，雖帶著一點俏皮，事實，却確乎有根據，有來歷。假定那位文學家說的話，可以比一幅銀行家的簡筆速寫，那麼鄧君這一篇文章，猶之乎把銀行家，用X光攝取出來的一張透視膠片。</p>
<p>不過，話該說回來。「蔽於一曲，闇於大體」也在所難免。像筆者親眼看到的一幕慘劇，比較上就稍微有些出入。因爲故事演出得太火辣，太動人。腦盒裏，心幕上，都揩磨不掉。這里，我也套著鄧君的手法，來一段開塲白：</p>
<p>雨傘，借進借出，儘管借。</p>
<p>晴天，落雨天，也無所謂。</p>
<p>只是，碰到瞎子，要留心。</p>
<p>尤其，至親好友，親，親到怎樣？好，好到怎樣？要弄明白，摸淸楚。</p>
<p>開塲白說過，再說正書：</p>
<p>一位銀行家</p>
<p>我有位朋友，是有地位的銀行家，只不幸他是書生出身。這不是說書生不好做銀行家，實則書卷氣太濃，總不大合轍。要知過，銀行家有銀行家的基本條件！頭腦，眼光，手段，心機，脾氣，身坯，甚至於脚勁，（沒有脚勁就站不住），處處要另有一功，纔彀得上資格。我那朋友，不單這許多銀行家的竅嵌，從頭到脚，都沒有揣摩到家，連著一點起碼面部表情，也學不像樣。而且，還有」個最壞的缺點，就是喜歡「善意待人」專門在晴天借雨傘進來，雨天借雨傘出去，這就因爲他是書生，重情感，怕麻煩，一聽見好話，就會當眞。不過，雨傘這件東西，晴天借進來，多麼容易；雨天借出去，多麼吃香，所以他就一直道樣做。做，做，就做出毛病來了！</p>
<p>瞎子借雨傘</p>
<p>去年九月，有一時期，銀根緊俏，不讓六底。自然這就是所謂落雨天。我那朋友平常信用好，人又忠實，在一般人是落雨天，在他，還是處於「陰晴」狀態，進來的雨傘，依舊源源不斷，然而，借出去的雨傘，却在這個時候，發生了問題。有的說雨大，不肯還，要延期。有的　直竟把借來的雨傘，當作自己的雨傘。笑話！眞笑話！在無綫電不是聽到過「瞎子借雨傘」嗎？想不到這一個家喻戶曉的滑稽故事，居然會　演到我那朋友的身上。這麼一來，他就晴天變雨天，濛雨變驟雨。聽說，借雨傘給我朋友的，其中有一個，是他至親，至親，自然比較親近，消息也占先一步，一隙到我那朋友的雨傘，給人乾沒，擱住，就第一個發動，要立刻討還雨傘。之後，別人曉得至親問他討雨傘，怎肯落後示弱，就集團圍攏來，逼討雨鋅。于是我那朋友，借進來的雨傘要還，借出去的雨傘收不回。啼笑皆非之下，感到缺頭寸！發現擺不平！只好把三十年辛苦所積的雨傘，盡所有還給傘主；不足，把住過廿五年的房子，出頂還雨傘；不足，把上上下下動用傢伙，變賣還雨傘；不足，把廚房里比較細巧値錢的瓷盌瓦缽，作價還雨傘；不足，再把心愛的一部百納本廿四史，另另碎碎幾部四部叢刋本的集子，加上幾册明淸刋本的木板書，一應包括在內抵償雨傘。</p>
<p>闔家一把淚</p>
<p>七十二小時，把一個美滿家庭，拆得五花散飛！終于在十月四日那天，拖著一個患肺病剛在請醫吃藥的妻子，五個還沒有自食能力的男女孩子，含着一泡眼淚，就此悄悄地離開了上海！承他情，當我是知己，曾寫過一封信給我，信是寫得像散文詩一樣，我也爲他灑了不少同情之淚！而且，在字裏行間，可以猜想到他一點近况：雖不見得像袁中郞說的「托缽歌妓之院，分餐孤老之盤」那麼光景。然而，「一身狼狽，朝不保夕」。倒的確是嚐著滋味！</p>
<p>我　這篇文字的動機，並不是　銀行家或非銀行家，有所偏阿，也不是反對雨傘借進借出，總括一句，還是總結到上面的一段開塲白，好！再寫上一遍：</p>
<p>雨傘，借進借出，　管偕。</p>
<p>晴天，落雨天，也無所謂。</p>
<p>只是，碰到瞎子，要留心。</p>
<p>尤其，至親好友，親，親到怎樣？好，好到怎樣？要弄明白，摸淸楚。</p>
<h3>「出門不利」與「不宜動土」</h3>
<p>— 無余</p>
<p>下面的故事雖爲無稽之談，但是却頗有深刻意思。</p>
<p>某父子俱爲篤信迷信者，凡事必欲翻看黃曆，以揀選日子之吉凶而行之。</p>
<p>一天這父親要出門去收帳，便拿起黃曆來查看一下，恰巧這天爲「出門不利」，他懊傷萬分左思右想，百不得策。忽然間，它想出一辦法來了，他想「出門不利」我不要從「門」中出去，就得了嗎？我不是可以從牆上鑽一洞出去嗎？他立刻就動手在牆上掘了一個洞，鑽了出去，但當他身體鑽出一半的時候，牆因爲根基不好，竟坍了下來了，磚瓦泥土堆滿在他的身上，他時了起來，兒子聞聲而出，父親說「兒子快些把我拖出來我快要壓死了」兒子聽了，並不立刻把他救出，反而奔向內室查了查黃曆出來道：「父親今天「不宜動土」，我想你還是多躺一天吧！明天我再來拖你出來。</p>
<h3>論年夜飯</h3>
<p>— 天虹</p>
<p>「年夜飯」充滿了中國倫理精神；</p>
<p>「年夜飯」在民俗學中佔有重要的位置。</p>
<p>「閣下今年回府過年嗎？」</p>
<p>那麼「年夜飯」就是「過年」的象徵，無數的「家」在勉强維持着中國社會機構，這是基本而可憐的單位。在這種形形色色的單位中間，實際上它是多麼空洞！許許多多胼手胝足的夫婦，「家」不過是他們的逆旅，「年夜飯」給以充實內容，雖然淡飯淸茶，但當在融融的燭光下，端坐吃飯，想到一年辛苦，想到一年奮鬥，在生活綫上掙扎過來，有多少辛酸？有多少快樂？只有在這一個單位中才能體味，才能瞭解。吃這頓是何等悄緒，，何等滋味！</p>
<p>如非中國人，如爲中國人而沒有在社會中奮鬥一年的人，中國的「年夜飯」對他沒有什麼意味。沒有生活曲折的人，他的「年夜飯」也淡而無味。「年夜飯」的光榮應該屬於嚴肅辛勤工作的人們，而不應該由荒淫無恥的人們所分享，他們一年來做了些什麼？他們的這頓年夜飯包藏了多少人的血汗？</p>
<p>一個年老的母親，在融融的燭光底下，備好了一頓粗茶淡飯，想念着他的遠方遊子，他顫抖着手，裝了一碗飯，放上幾塊菜，備一副碟筷，算是在一起吃「年夜飯」，祝遠方的遊子安康。這種短故事產生在無數的家庭裏，這中間包含着嚴肅而虔誠的中國倫理精神。</p>
<p>中國社會如此殘破，各種各樣的吃「年夜飯」方式，同樣包含着上述的精神。是一股頑強而不易毀滅的力量。廣義的年夜飯係在朋友親戚中間吃來吃去，而眞正有意義的年夜飯，則是在他的「家」裏，在這個眞實的社會細胞中，「年夜飯」產生了積極的人生價値。</p>
<p>俄國人喜歡討論人生，中國人則體味人生，「年夜飯」是一個最明顯的表徵。</p>

<h3>平劇空前盛瘵</h3>
<p>— 沉</p>
<p>劇</p>
<p>此次本市十一團體聯合主持之平劇義務會串，自一月八日起連演十四天之久，規模之大，日期之久，爲從來未有者，南北名伶，生旦領袖，同時演出，旦有梅蘭芳程硯秋，生有譚富英，陳大澳，楊寳森，李少春，即在北平，亦不易多觀，可謂空前盛會。</p>
<p>戲碼亦甚整齊，鬃紅烈馬外，四郞探母之夕，尤為精彩，李少春，袁世海之連環套，程硯秋譚富英之桑園會，殿以梅博士及三大鬚生陳楊趙之全部探母，眞所謂齣齣可觀，李少春七時半已登塲，確爲難得。余派名鬚生陳大樓自平載譽歸來，留滬已久，此次亦參加義務戲探母中之回令，飾中四郞，盜令起出開見娘止，唱做俱佳，成績在楊寳森趙培鑫之上，吊毛之輕鬆美觀，允受衆賞，全劇以陳風頭最健。</p>
<p>此次義務戲因事前各方要求者太多，幾位名伶無法應付，乃改爲聯合演出，統籌統配，减少麻煩不少。</p>
<p>四郞探母第一夕，坐宮時，因趙培鑫快板對唱時，忘記漏了兩句，害得梅博士忙趕上，第二日坐宮，即改由楊寳森配演唱戲確非易事。</p>
<p>飛機連連失事，坐者還是坐，李世芳雖在靑島遇難，此次譚富英父子及蕭長華等返平，還是坐飛機，頗有勇氣，刻已安抵北平。</p>
<p>小生祭酒姜妙香，今日下午三時在南華酒家，爲其公子少香完婚，一週前已普發請柬，姜伶人緣極佳，交遊頗廣，預料往賀者必衆。</p>
<p>紡劈坤伶童芷苓，前傳將下嫁某富商，茲悉不確，現仍居住呂班路甘邨，惟不時周旋於交際塲所，聞農曆新正或赴南京某戲院出演。</p>
<h3>兩部好片子</h3>
<p>— 張</p>
<p>影</p>
<p>「居禮夫人」與「幽默大師」是本週最佳的兩部頭輪片。二者都是傳記片，只是前者嚴肅（然而並不沉悶），後者因爲叙寫的是美國近代著名幽默作家馬克吐溫的故事，笑料顯得豐富一點。居禮夫婦的故事根據他們小女兒伊芙所著的「居禮夫人傳」改編而成，因此相當忠實。只是他們四年中嘗試了五千六百七十七次方始成功的鎭與鐳的分裂過程，在銀幕上只輕輕地用幾個鏡頭帶過了—其實他們那時在窮困的環境中艱苦奮鬥所遭過的折磨，正不止於此。</p>
<p>「黃牛」勢將活躍</p>
<p>再過三四天，舊曆新年到了，照例是喜氣洋洋逛逛笑笑的時候了。電影院照例又將擠滿了人，黃牛黨勢必又將活躍，各影院當局據說都在預先設法防止。有的想憑證購劵，有的想提前售票，有的託「謀得利行」代定。其實，假若警務人員能在戲院門前嚴加監視，事情豈不便簡單了。</p>
<h3>羊身人吹笛</h3>
<p>樂</p>
<p>這是一幅「幻想畫」：善吹洋笛的「羊身人」（有×號），〔希臘神話的怪物〕居然出現於交響樂隊中，莫怪担任指揮的音樂大師也張口結舌了。（按「洋人」在「幻想曲」片子中曾經出現。</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3>晚上的笛聲</h3>
<p>— 西班牙阿左林著　嚴大椿譯</p>
<p>一八二〇年。有人在晚上吹奏一管笛子，那是文雅，抑揚而沈奮的音調。</p>
<p>假使我們從古老的城門往那座古城裏去，必須登上一條斜坡。斜坡底上有一條河，一座高原俯親着一塊平地，在二列茂盛的老榆樹之間，有幾塊巨石鑿成的櫈子；在夜的朦朧中，依稀辨得出它們的白色。</p>
<p>再遠些，在榆樹間的小徑末端，村子的入口處，有一道亮光射到路上；那是從一所屋子裹射出來的。假使我們走進寬大的廊下，在那裹可以看見一張桌子，桌前放置一座古舊的織布搬，桌旁有一只斜面寫字檯，放着幾本樂譜。我們還可以看見一個白髮的矮老人和一個孩子。孩子在玩聲笛。吸的是一只徐緩的諧曲，在這晚上的靜穆中聽來，有點悶　之感。</p>
<p>城裏的屋宇　擠在大敎堂的四周，天井裏都設有澄淸的水池，還有許多專爲零賣商和馬具商人佔據的小走道，大房子上裝着花崗石雖的徽章。在大殿後面有一個花園。</p>
<p>那些難得光顧的旅客，一且到了那裏，總是投宿在愛斯脫來拉旅館裏的，</p>
<p>每晚，公共馬車迅速地駛過靠近河邊的榆樹間的小路。行近那所有亮光的屋子時，顚簸的馬車所發出的木板和鐵器的激響，把那些尖銳的笛聲呑沒幾分鐘。過後，那枝笛重新在晚上的靜默中吹奏起來。在白畫，屋子裏的舊織布機織着，發出一個均勻的音調。</p>
<p>一八七〇年。五十年過去了，如果我們要進那座古城，須經過那古老的城門。我們在橋頭下軍，越過河流。正是九點鐘，一片沉沒。在上面，在許多古屋的聚集地方，可以望見幾道微光。我們放棄下面的硝皮作—那些在賽蘭斯丁旁邊的朽廢的硝皮作，登上斜坡，我們尋着茂盛的上百年的榆樹間的小徑，在黑暗中，不易辨出石櫈的白點。那邊一道光輝投在路上，</p>
<p>我們聽到一個笛聲，它是不是從那所屋子裏傳出來的？沈鬱而冗長的諧曲彷彿一條水晶的綫，就要折斷的樣子。</p>
<p>在那廊下，坐着一位老人和二個孩子，孩子中的一個玩着笛子，另一個默默地注視着，面現喜色，蔚藍的雙眼睜得圓大。老人下時指導吹笛的孩子。是好久了，在好久之前，這位老人也是一個孩子。每晚上，在這同一個地方，用同一根笛奏着同樣的諧曲。</p>
<p>馬車經過，木板和鐵器震耳的激饗，在短時間內聽下見柔和的笛聲。繼而，它重新在夜間唱着。</p>
<p>上面的古屋都睡熟了，小徑旁的那些榆樹也睡了，河流也睡了。</p>
<p>一小時之後，笛聲停止，那個沉默喜悅的孩子離開那裏，往城中去。在城裏，在廣塲旁的一座高大的古屋裏，他念着，念得十分疲倦時，才去睡覺。</p>
<p>遊客不大光顧這個村子。倘使你來了，你就得住在愛斯脫來拉旅館裏，因爲再沒有別所旅蛇。那旅館開設在拿凡絲路上，靠近巴索和阿繆定。旅客大都是從田野那裹和安琪兒路上來的。</p>
<p>流逝了多少歲月呢？</p>
<p>在瑪德里，一個頂樓裏，有一個白鬚的男子，他那對蔚藍的大眼睛，正如從前那個帶着微笑的孩子。——出神地注視着另外一個拿着笛子吹奏一枝沉鬱而冗長的譜曲的孩子。</p>
<p>那男子穿得很樸素，在他的房間裹，有一張桌子，放着書籍。借着一道强列的陽光，可以看出幾本拿掉的書跡。牆壁上懸着二幅好看的照片，一張是一位婦人的照，一對沉思的美眼，纖細的鬃髮垂到額上，另一張是一個女孩子的照，同婦人一樣漂亮，一樣沉思。</p>
<p>可是，在這屋子裏聽下見女人的聲音。</p>
<p>白鬚男子寫了好久，然後拿着他的紙頭跑到街上去，他在人家進進出出，與人們談論着。他往往把那些紙頭帶回房裏，放在一只抽斗裏，同了積滿塵埃的遺忘了的其他的紙頭放在一起。</p>
<p>一九〇〇年。從前那　每晚登上河旁的斜坡，取着榆樹間的小徑開往古城去的馬車，已經不存在了。在那裏，建有一個火車站。</p>
<p>到了晚上，火車也在古城前停下，不過在舊橋和榆樹間的小路的另一　停下。難得有旅客下車。有一晚，有一個旅客下車。他是一位白鑽藍眼的老人。身上穿着一件舊大衣，手裏提着一只破箱子。老人讀出車站，走到公共馬車前時，火車已經離站，在黑夜中向礦野裏馳去。</p>
<p>公共屬車載着客人向城中最好的愛斯脫來拉旅館開去。那個旅館是以老牌子著名的。它的所在——不再是拿凡絲路，如今是在一個主要的廣塲旁，一所高偉的建築裏了。</p>
<p>馬車裏坐着那位白鬚老人，車子把他帶走。當那車子開到廣塲旁的旅館前面時，老人認識這座房子，在這房子裏他曾消磨掉他的童年。</p>
<p>茶房把他安頓在一個房間裹，那個房間正是他少年時代誦讀的地方。他認識一切，坐下來，長歎一聲，將手按在緊壓的胸口。</p>
<p>他渴望吸一點空曠地方的空氣，走出旅館，跑過那些小路，他走着，老是走着。到了榆樹閱的小徑上。夜是晴好而寂靜，在沉靜裏傳來一個笛聲，淸脆的聲音，令人想起一根水晶似的綫，那是一只徐緩，沉鬱，古老的諧曲。</p>
<p>一道光輝由一座屋子裏射出來。這位旅客趨近去，他看見在廊下有一個老人和一個孩子。孩子把笛子吹出柔和的諧曲。於是白鬚老人坐在小徑旁的一塊石頭上，手放在緊壓的胸口，悲哀地回憶過去。</p>
<h3>第一句謊話</h3>
<p>— 千繁君</p>
<p>—夢憶之一—</p>
<p>十四歲的秋天，我順利升入了中學；由於自己在全縣小學生會考中僥倖獲得了第一，是由縣敎育局免費保送進縣中的；中學與小學，在環境上的差異實在比在學業上的差異更大，使我的單色的幼小的心眼裏，開始領悟出人世間的複雜，尤以男女同學間的故意的諱避，使我也覺得了男女間的羞恥；在小學裏的共同研讀，共同嬉閙，已成了不可復得的溫暖的回憶，像凋謝了的花朶一樣，使人有感傷的心情；於是我變得孤獨了，但是我的心，却慢慢地熾熱起來。</p>
<p>說句眞話，那時候我並不懂得「愛情」與「戀愛」；可是我却爲一位長得比我高大，生得並不漂亮的女同學吸引了，她像冬天的太陽，一離開，我便感覺得寒冷與孤單，就在這樣的心情裏我想默默地接近她；但是，我又怕和她接觸在一起；因爲羞恥已在我們之間開掘了一條深溝，使男與女分立在溝的兩邊邊……在如此矛盾的心情下，我開始了孤獨的單思。</p>
<p>她是遠道來的住堂生，宿舍一在我們教室的旁邊，來得早的人，可以在身旁細點着她們的人數，看她們捧着碗鍵奔跳着越過就條畏廊走向膳廳去進餐；從某一天的早晨起，我爲了她，惟恐有所躭誤，每天做了黎明的最先的訪謁者，太陽總此我遲起，我突然變得如此喜愛早起的人了！</p>
<p>像刻好了的印板一樣，天天我獨個靠伏在窗檻上，默數着她們的脚步，目送她們進膳廳，又迎接她們笑着出來；她們的奔跳，會增加我血液的循流，她的雙眼輕輕向我一掃，我的臉上便抹上一層發燒的紅光；但是我的心却舒泰了，一天的最重大的心事也因此而落下；於是我收回半條心思來溫讀自己的功課；我像是有了一樣，每天熬着自己的苦痛，遂得一點心情的溫暖……</p>
<p>父母是愛我的，老師也很歡喜我，同學都敬忌我；我的早起，分外增加了他們對我的愛，對我的歡喜，對我的敬忌；父母一聽得我起身的聲音，總愛加上這樣幾句咐咯：「功課雖重要，身體更叢要，你需要更多一點的休息」！老師見我獨個兒坐在敎室裏，總愛撫着我的肩膀說：「你應該將學間與健康一同求得」！同學見我先他們到了校，總愛說：「你考得了田等第一名，還想考特等不成」！這些話，往往會促使我痛苦起來，我的確還沒有忘記自己的功課……也就在他們如此的錯覺裏，我把自己的秘密躱藏得很好。</p>
<p>紙是包不住火的，功課也經不起荒廢的考驗，第一次月考，我竟跌落了乙等，這使父母驚異，老師驚異，同學驚異；於是生理敎員的一句「名語」傳遍了全校：「靑年在發育時期的智慧是要衰退的」，我便做了這句「名語」的證人……但是最淸楚的還是我自已，我雖然惋惜過去的光榮將從此褪色，却又慶喜自己的秘密得永遠隱藏……</p>
<p>第二個月開始，連她也用輕視的眼光瞧我，我的早起，僅使得父母加倍的疼惜，和級任敎師的詫異，同學不再向我挑釁，在更寂寬的環境裏需要更多的溫暖，我沒有躭誤每一個早晨。</p>
<p>畢竟有這麼一天，我照例靠伏在窗檻上，目送她們蹦跳着投進膳　，又迎接她們嘻笑着回來，當我要收回半條心思來溫讀自己的功課的時候，突然發覺級任先生的呼吸逼靠着我的肩頭，我被迫得哭呌出來，我怕我心底的秘密被發現以後將會遭遇到怎樣的羞辱……</p>
<p>「繁君！怎麼？怎麼？你太奇怪了！</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>沉默像在宣洩我的秘密，恐怖乃逼使我迸發出第一句謊話：「我見了一個鬍鬚佬佬……」</p>
<p>一句謊話，使我担當了一個「白日見鬼」的歹名，先生和父母又迫令我休養了一星期；但是誰曉得我的眞心呢！</p>
<h3>喜劇</h3>
<p>— 李文勳</p>
<p>高太太今天起身己有十點多鐘，天氣委實太冷，每天起身在高太太無異是一種刑罰了。</p>
<p>醒來雖然很早，睡在溫馨的被窩裏有點戀戀不捨，最後下了決心，才一骨碌爬起床來，披着大衣，坐在馬桶上看報。這是高太太底習慣。這樣總要化去足足半個鐘點，然後又以最大決心立起身來，在鏡台前開始梳洗，洗了臉，漱了口，擦了粉，畫好　毛，塗上脣膏，在着衣鏡裏轉側　盼，所有腰身，臀部，胸隔，背影，髮式，都滿意了，一種很嫵媚的表情使她老人家大爲感動，竟至站在鏡子面前若有所思的獃了半天，才輕輕的嘆口氣。微微頷首，對於自己，臨去靑春底晚霞般的美麗，不免有點點降惜的意思。</p>
<p>高太太——看機子至多不過四十來歲，海虎絨大衣，紅毛絨綫的圍巾，高跟皮鞋，法蘭西小帽，玻璃絲綫，十個手指甲紅得可愛，尖得可愛，小小的眼睛在月兒彎彎的眉毛下面流盼多情，雙頰在出處女似的矯紅，髮式也是很年輕，很時式的，從頭到脚，甚至從她底睡覺的風流體態，從她吸烟和上馬桶的姿勢看來，也無一不是十足海派，乳房和腰身更不用說是「海」得要命的。</p>
<p>她坐在絲絨沙發裏看報，張媽端進一杯牛奶來，高太太說：「張媽，今天到××路陸稿薦去買點醬鴨子來換換口味吧」。</p>
<p>說着，就在玻璃皮包裏掏出五干塊錢來遞給張媽，道位三十來歲的娘姨還是初初來，怯生生的說：「太太，陸稿薦可不認得呀」。</p>
<p>「糊塗虫，就是上個禮拜和你去買鷄屁股的那一家呀」。高太太瞪了她一個白眼，又低下頭去看報了。</p>
<p>張媽走在馬路上有點糊塗，前個禮拜雖去買過，早就忘記了怎麼走法，悅悅蕩蕩的，不知要走向哪兒去。最後沒辦法，就在一家呌做「山三珍」的店子裏買了五千塊錢的醬鴨子帶回家來了。</p>
<p>高太太底唳覺非常銳敏，提出來一聞陡然變色，大聲喝叱：</p>
<p>「你騙得過我麼？這那裏是陸稿薦底鴨子，拿去換」！</p>
<p>高太太底脾氣向來如此，高太太是陸稿薦底老主題之一•吃多了便非陸稿薦底不可，甚至有了一種癮，一定要陸稿薦底東西才能過癮了。</p>
<p>張媽無奈，又回到閙洋洋的街上，轉來轉去，愁眉苦險，忽然想起家裏上次和太太去陸稿藨買鴨子的時候還有一張招牌紙留在廚房裏。</p>
<p>「有了法兒了，這一下有了法兒了」。她在心裏快樂的想。</p>
<p>急急忙忙回到家裏，先到廚房裏，把那張陸稿薦底招牌包裝紙換上，喜冲冲的拿到房間裏，快樂的呌着說：</p>
<p>「太太，這一下可買着了，好難找。」</p>
<p>「糊塗虫」。高太太又瞪了她一個白眼，再提起來一聞，不禁老吃審似的笑了起來，呵呵的說：</p>
<p>「這才是陸稿底鴨子哩，味道大不相同啦」！</p>
<h3>止水</h3>
<p>— 東方明</p>
<p>止水</p>
<p>這是一潭死寂的止水。</p>
<p>這裏沒有喋喋的魚聲，沒有雀雀的鳥鳴，沒有花香，沒有人語，只是靜靜地靜靜地獨處在那裹，彷彿早已被人遺忘了的。</p>
<p>偶有一陣微風吹過，水面上便起了粼鄰的皺波。</p>
<p>偶有幾片晚霞在天邊潛來，便替它抹上絢爛的幾筆。</p>
<p>這一瞬是美麗了，然隨即就消逝了。</p>
<p>不知從何處跳來了一隻靑蛙，止水邊便有了「閣閣」的歌唱。</p>
<p>這一瞬是熱閙的，然隨即亦消逝了；因爲靑蛙也不甘止水的寂寞。</p>
<p>只有多情的微風和溫柔的晚霞，還不時來慰藉；爲它吹起鄰粼的皺波，爲它抹上絢爛的幾筆。</p>
<p>然瞬間又都消逝了，消逝了，依然是靜靜地靜靜地一潭死寂的止水。</p>
<p>素燭</p>
<p>深愛照亮這黑暗斗室的一枝小小的素燭。</p>
<p>每夜，當電燈習慣地閉了它的眼睛，當萬籟俱寂無在的黑暗中，在凄淸寂寞的子夜裏，燭做了我最好的伴侶。</p>
<p>華貴的酒筵上，是用不着它的；紅燈綠酒的塲面上，是鄙棄它的；一切人間的熱閙者，是不會記得它的；它只生活在黑暗的角落裏，生活在寂寞者的心上。</p>
<p>黑暗裏，它平和地放着光。它不會逢迎，趨時，詔媚。它永久是孤單而平和地發着微弱的光，照亮着自已，照亮着黑暗，照亮着寂寞的眼睛。</p>
<p>多少歌頌的時篇，多少感懷的文字，都在寂寞者的心弦上發着共鳴，它不會被一切人間的熱鬧着所瞭解的。</p>
<p>它燃着，發着光和熱。它永遠是黑暗的罪人，溫暖着寂寞者的心，捐着身子。</p>
<p>誰曾在無比的黑暗中看見一點豆似的燭火，而歡呼鼓舞嗎，它不盡溫暖了寂寞者的心，還照亮無數在黑暗裏摸索着的人。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血154</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>兩人兵器一對招，來人連挫三步，一矮身，取了一個半坐半跪的姿式，雙手抱刀，尖鋒正對着　見。這種姿式，表示來人是一個女子；鶴見當然一目了然。這女子身形較矮，却頗厚實，不帶一點嬝條　娜的形態；連頭連臉兜着一塊白紗，看不出面目，却是一身玄色急裝，要不是那塊白紗，罩住了頭面，鶴見還誤認牠是黑龍會的會員哩。</p>
<p>「平野宗」是什麼意思呢？乃是日本劍道的一個宗派。日本劍道分宗很多；名家都有一個劍師，一脈傳下來，都有幾下不同的巧招。這「平野宗」在各宗裹，佔有正宗領銜的資格，當然厲害。而縣鶴見一轉身迎招的時候，心下早已吃了一驚，因爲就　刀鋒的出手‘，知道　的劍道，已經是第七通，自己不見得比她高了多少，唯一取勝的方法，只有油門。</p>
<p>二人一對鋒，立刻正式交手起來。第七這的　，下能拿回合計算，有時僅僅一個回合就分輸贏，而第一回合與第二回之間，時間長短，沒有規定；有　　　，有時却得十分鐘以上，或更長時間，兩相厮拚着。在厮拚對擬當中，雖有回旋進退，都是拿自己的精神和氣魄，跟對方凝擬對抗。但這個女劍手，性子相當躁烈；初起幾個回合，還有二一分鐘的厮拚，不接兵刃，她一見鶴見用的汕鬥方式，自己便改取攻勢，攻到十來下之後，倐地把長劍交給右手，左手拔出了身邊的一枝七首，更猛烈地進攻起來。這麼一來，鶴見看出了對方，竟是一個大勁敵，因爲雙手揮刃，男子中尚不多見；這個女子居然如此潑皮，可見本領很高，自己不能不十分小心應付。</p>
<p>誰知鶴見正在一人一敵，感覺不易打發的當口，忽然瞥見黑龍會方面的劍手，好幾個人同時倒地，斜面佔了勝着的敵方，却有一人，飛也似的，向鶴見這裏鮑來，看樣子是要接應那個潑皮女子，夾攻自己一人。這時猛又　得遠遠地，暗暗嗚嗚穩穩幾聲「尺八」（日本篇）一般的啓筆，像鬼哭一樣，隨風傳來；頓時這邊樹脚下，也有一樣暗嗚筆聲應和着，心下十分驚疑，不知究竟怎麼一回事。自己一邊的人，不但未見半個影子，連信號或他種　告，一點也得不到。</p>
<p>樹下啓篥，嗚咽朱了，這邊上前夾攻的那人，早一陣風似的，捲到鶴見這裏，鶴見早有準備，虛晃一報，便向一邊挪開兩步，如此，三個人站成了一個一角陣式。上來的道人，也是一個小小個子，裝束打扮，與那女劍手，一模一樣；行動却伶俐得多，身體也像個女人樣子，腰肢苗條裊娜，頭面也罩着一塊白紗。</p>
<p>三人剛一擬正劍鋒，後來的這個人，只上前一步，把兵器虛晃了一晃，便開口了，人是向着鶴見，話却是遞給那個同黨的；一聽聲音，就知道又是萍子：</p>
<p>「春子姐，怎麼樣？……大概試到他的斤兩了吧？……笛子響了，我們該走了」。說着又轉了口音：「侵大哥，您這諸的甚麼英雄？貴同志們早已安全撤退了，嘻嘻……」說着的當口，其他各方對壘的小集團，都已散了陣式，雜色集團，邊退邊門，奇怪的是那些黑龍會會員，也來並不怎樣加緊追擊，好像有些長縮，一任外來的劍手們撤退似的。</p>

<h3>Government Expects Peace Talks to Reopen: Yan'an's Reply Has Not Yet Arrived in Nanjing, Zhang Zhizhong Paid Respects to the Chairman Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The government, hoping that peace negotiations can reopen soon, has repeatedly expressed concessions and has also agreed to a new proposal. It also plans to send Zhang Zhizhong and others to Yan'an immediately. After the matter was notified to the CCP by the ambassador, all eyes are focused on the CCP's reply. As of the evening of the 17th, the CCP office stated that they had not yet received a reply telegram. Certain influential figures, analyzing the current domestic and international situation, observed that the CCP may have a new expression regarding whether these peace talks can be reopened, believing that there are more optimistic elements for the future. As for Zhang Zhizhong himself, in addition to expressing yesterday his hope that more representatives could be sent to Yan'an, he paid respects to the Chairman on the morning of the 17th to discuss matters. In the evening, he took advantage of Yu Youren's banquet to talk with Shao Lizi for a long time.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Regarding the government's plan to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an, after the ambassador notified the CCP, the CCP wired Yan'an on the 16th for instructions. Currently, they are awaiting a reply telegram, and the government is also waiting for this reply. Zhang himself stated that he is happy to accept the government's mission.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The ambassador's personal advisor, Fu Jingbo, visited Zhang Zhizhong at nine o'clock on the morning of the 17th. It is reported that Fu expressed that the U.S. hopes the government will focus on the content of the negotiations, not only creating an atmosphere of peace talks, but also actually ensuring that the opinions of both the KMT and the CCP can be brought closer.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The date of Zhang Zhizhong's trip to Yan'an depends on the CCP's reply. Zhang stated that the CCP's response may be to send representatives to Nanjing again to reopen peace talks. If so, he will terminate his trip to Yan'an. The government will not announce the new peace proposal for the time being. He also said that if he goes to Yan'an, another senior government official will accompany him, but he did not specify whether it would be Zhang Jun or Shao Lizi. He only expressed optimism about the future of the negotiations personally.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Wang Bingnan stated that the peace proposals were telegraphed to Yan'an on the 16th, but it is not known when a reply from Yan'an can be received. It is believed that the government will only be able to reply after the leaders in Yan'an have received them. Qualified politicians here believe that Yan'an will not refuse Zhang's flight to Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Relevant sources stated that reopening peace talks is still in the exploratory stage. It is expected that the CCP will not firmly reject peace talks, otherwise it will bear the infamous reputation of sabotaging peace talks. However, reopening peace talks is easy, but achieving peace is difficult. Everything still requires patience. The government representatives only presented the main items of the peace proposal this time in Shanghai, without specifying the detailed methods, fearing that secrets would be leaked, hindering the progress of peace talks. In fact, some key points in the proposal may still await the final instructions of the highest authorities.</p>
<h3>Lei Zhen Leaves Shanghai for Nanjing, Seven Representatives of the China Democratic Socialist Party Accompany Him</h3>
<p>[Our Report] China Democratic Socialist Party representatives Zhang Junmai, Wu Xianz, Wan Renqian, Jiang Yunshi, Xu Fulin, Cheng Wenxi, and Yang Lingming, along with government representative Lei Zhen, boarded a special train attached to the night train at 9:50 last night to go to Nanjing. Sun Binyi also went to Nanjing to handle matters related to going abroad and is scheduled to return to Shanghai before the end of the lunar year. Lei Zhen went to the China Democratic Socialist Party office yesterday morning to visit Hu Haimen, Liang Qiushui, Sun Shiyi, and others. In the evening, he visited Fan Yuan again to visit Zhang Junmai and expressed his hope to visit Luo Longji. Before leaving, Lei told reporters that in addition to consulting on reopening peace talks, this time, the representatives of the China Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party were invited to Nanjing to study the election law and other constitutional issues, and the formulation of the election law is a specialized technical task. As for the new peace proposal, when he left Nanjing, he only determined the outline of the content, which is still being organized into text. The proposal only involves major points, without detailing trivial matters for the time being, to highlight the main points and resolve the current difficult situation. During the meeting with representatives of various parties in Shanghai this time, only major topics were raised to seek opinions from all parties. Detailed content was not discussed in detail due to confidentiality. Now that General Zhang Zhizhong is about to depart, he believes there is no need to wait for the representatives of the two parties to arrive in Nanjing before going to Yan'an. Furthermore, China Youth Party representatives Li Huang and Chen Qitian will also go to Nanjing soon. It is heard that Hu Haimen and Liang Qiushui will fly to Beiping soon.</p>
<h3>China Democratic League's Statement on the Current Situation: To Be Released Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Democratic League is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2 p.m. on the 20th at the Tsinghua Alumni Association on Jiujiang Road to release a statement on the current situation and to host foreign reporters at 4:30 p.m. on the same day.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Fan Pu斋 of the China Democratic League told reporters that mutual trust between the two sides is most important for reopening peace talks, followed by conditions. If mutual trust is not established, the more conditions there are, the less hope there is for success. Also, the atmosphere and mood during the peace talks are very important. Today, recalling the harmonious atmosphere when the political consultative conference resolution was established, it feels like another world.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi and Zuo Shunsheng Arrive in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] China Youth Party members Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, and Liu Dongyan arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 17th. Zuo attended the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Conference, while Zeng Qi went to the hospital with his wife for medical treatment. Zuo is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 19th. According to reporters, after the National Assembly closes, there are two major events: reorganizing the government and resuming peace talks. These two events are linked and hopefully will proceed successfully and quickly.</p>

<h3>Marshall to Fly to Washington Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 17th] According to informed sources, Marshal Marshall is scheduled to fly to Washington this week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington] "World Report" Weekly stated that U.S. policy toward China has long been in adjustment to cope with changes in the environment, but the U.S. will not completely withdraw from China. Marshall fears Soviet intervention and has decided that the U.S. must maintain a major force on the Asian continent.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Abolition of Three Regulations for Counties and Cities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] On the 15th, the Executive Yuan issued an order to abolish three regulations: (1) Regulations for the Establishment and Administration of Bureau in County and Municipal Governments, (2) Measures for Handling Misconduct of County and Municipal Councilors, (3) Provisional Organizational Measures for County and Municipal Councils During the Period of Supporting Self-Government.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Department Officially Announces Embargo on U.S. Citizens Traveling to Dalian; U.S. State Department Says It Did Not Authorize It</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] The Navy Department announced today that it has ordered all ship commanders not to transport American merchants or journalists to Dalian without permission from the State Department or other competent authorities. At today's press conference, State Department News Director McDermott was asked by Burton Crane, Shanghai correspondent for the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, whether it was true that the U.S. Navy had ordered all ships not to carry American merchants and journalists to Dalian, a message received from U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai, McKenna. McDermott replied that he was aware of the order but it was not authorized by the State Department and that he had nothing more to add. When reporters turned to the Navy Department to inquire about the matter, a department spokesman said that the Navy Department had instructed commanders of ships in the Western Pacific that naval vessels must have the approval of the responsible government agency to carry guests and did not directly prohibit civilians from traveling to Dalian or other ports. The department did not formally explain why it issued such an instruction.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Send Note to the Soviet Union Demanding the Opening of Dalian</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Regarding the opening of the port of Dalian to restore international trade, it is now reported that reliable sources say that Britain will send a note to the Soviet Union on this matter to back up the United States. The British government believes that Britain's interests in the area should be restored, given the imminent changes in the situation in Dalian. Britain's view is that all countries should be able to trade to North China and the Northeast via Dalian. The British government will soon send a note to the Soviet government to clarify this view. The British government urgently hopes that both sides can comply with the Sino-Soviet Treaty on the agreement on Dalian.</p>
<h3>Minister Yu Attends the People's Political Council to Report on Foreign Exchange and Other Issues; Attending Councilors Raise Questions One After Another</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Standing Committee of the National Political Council held its 13th meeting at 9 a.m. on the 17th and invited Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun to report on foreign exchange and related issues. More than ten resident councilors, including Wu Yifang, attended. After Chairman Mo Dehui announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Shao Lizi read a written diplomatic report, followed by Minister Yu's report, which detailed: (1) the foreign exchange issue, (2) the national budget for this year, (3) the issue of remittances from overseas Chinese, and (4) the issue of tax system adjustments. Minister Yu's report focused on past measures and future prospects. After the report, councilors Wu Chunwu, Wang Puhan, Zheng Kuiyi, Qian Gonglai, Fan Yusui, Su Yun, Lin Hu, Zuo Juesheng, Luo Heng, Peng Gechen, Yin Shuxian, Gan Jiawu, Xi Yueduo, and Dapusheng raised questions. Almost all of the attending councilors, except Wu Yilao, spoke. They all believed that the national financial crisis today is very deep and worrying. The current state of domestic war continues, and fighting a war with banknotes is very dangerous. They pointed out that the mismanagement of foreign exchange, the huge disparity between official and black market prices, and the constant fluctuations in gold and U.S. dollars are stimulating rising prices. They especially hoped that the issue of remittances from overseas Chinese could be improved, otherwise the remittances would completely evade Hong Kong and foreign banks. Zuo Juesheng painfully stated that the current situation is extremely serious. On the one hand, the lack of peace in the country has created an economic crisis; on the other hand, the deep financial crisis affects domestic peace. But if this continues to drag on, the economic future is worrying. Peng Gechen and others pointed out that those who manage foreign exchange are buying up foreign exchange, causing the government to suffer losses, corrupt officials to make money, and the people to suffer. Finally, councilor Dapusheng hoped to benefit the country and eliminate abuses, and promote the realization of the opinions provided by the councilors. Mo Dehui also hoped that Mr. Yu would convey the opinions of the councilors to President Zhu Ziven. Minister Yu answered the above questions separately.</p>
<h3>Four Proposals Passed to Be Submitted to the Government for Handling</h3>
<p>After the questioning was completed, the following proposals were passed: (1) The proposal by Wang Puhan et al. that disputes have arisen in the Yellow River blocking work, affecting the return of refugees in mountainous areas, and it is proposed that the government quickly resolve the case, decided to submit to the government for quick resolution. (2) Zheng Kuiyi et al. proposed to request the government to instruct the Four Banks Joint Office to launch production loans in Xiamen and Fuzhou, and it was decided to submit to the government for quick handling. (3) Zheng Kuiyi et al. proposed to request the government to improve the absorption of remittances from overseas Chinese, and it was decided to submit to the government for reference.

<h3>Sino-British Commercial Treaty Still Awaiting Consultation; Our Side Has Submitted a Counter-Proposal; Inland Navigation and Residence of Overseas Chinese Are the Main Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] In the Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations, our side has submitted a counter-proposal, which is currently being studied by the British side. It is reported that the main issues are inland navigation and residence. Our attitude is that the ships of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson can no longer navigate in our inland rivers, while the British side has discriminatory regulations regarding the residence of our overseas Chinese in their three islands, autonomous regions, or India, which are not as fair as the American approach. It is feared that considerable time for consultation will still be needed before both sides make a final decision.</p>
<h3>China Democratic Socialist Party's Views on Peace Talks: Both Sides Must Implement "Returning the Military to the Nation and Returning Politics to the People" Before the Key to Peace Talks Can Be Resolved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The China Democratic Socialist Party yesterday issued its views on the peace talks, stating:</p>
<p>Our party places endless hope on the recent resumption of peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Recalling that the reason why the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have failed to succeed in peace talks over the years is that the biggest reason is that each has its own military force. On the one hand, they are suspicious of each other, thinking that the other party has the ambition to eliminate me; on the other hand, each claims to be the best, thinking that I have the opportunity to eliminate the other party. If this continues in the future, I am afraid that peace talks will never succeed. However, our party still places endless hope on this peace talk, because "returning the military to the nation and returning politics to the people" has become a resolution of the Political Consultative Conference. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have acknowledged that this must be implemented. Our party hopes that the Kuomintang will start with itself. At present, the boundary between the party and the government in the central government has not been clearly defined. It can also be said that the party is above the government, the army belongs to the party, and the government is directed by the party. Now, in order to eliminate the Communist Party's suspicion, the only way is for the Kuomintang to truly and practically return the military to the nation, active servicemen completely withdraw from the party, and the Kuomintang retreats to the ranks of ordinary political parties. At the same time, returning politics to the people will eliminate the Communist Party's suspicion that the government and the Kuomintang are one and the same. If so, the Kuomintang can openly and honestly ask the Communist Party to return the military to the nation, and the key to peace talks can be resolved.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Communist Party insists on restoring the situation before January 13. Assuming that the Communist Party also returns the military to the nation, and the Kuomintang and the Communist Party do not divide the country, then there is no distinction between before and after January 13 for the national army to be stationed in the common territory. At the same time, the Communist Party opposes the National Assembly and the Constitution it has passed, but the Constitution it has passed is based on the Political Consultative Conference Constitution and should be recognized by all parties. Even if there are disagreements, they can be revised by submitting amendment articles when the next meeting is held. Since the Kuomintang has returned politics to the people, it is not only opening up the central government, but also the local government should be opened up at the same time. Why must the Communist Party necessarily divide a certain place as the Communist Party's regime and a certain place as the regime other than the Communist Party? Because they are in the same country, under the same legal system and the same political system, can they become a country. If the above is true, then returning the military to the nation and returning politics to the people, and both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party striving to implement them in good faith, is democracy, is peace. If peace and democracy can be achieved, the country will naturally be unified and naturally strong. Otherwise, each possessing its own party's army and exercising its own party's regime is anti-democracy. If it is anti-democracy, there can be no peace, no unification. The true meaning of democracy lies not in the propaganda of words, but in the manifestation of facts. The crystallization of peace talks lies here, and the spirit of reorganizing the government lies here.</p>
<p>Today, the national situation is extremely critical, the economy is collapsing, and the country is about to perish. What is so important that they cannot abandon suspicion and return to good relations?</p>
<p>Our party is impartial to both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. We hope that both parties can truly and practically return the military to the nation and return politics to the people, jointly creating a fair and just rule-of-law government that transcends all parties, and will naturally be supported by the people of the whole country. The foundation of a thousand words and ten thousand words of peace talks must be this. If so, they will wake up. If so, it will be success. This humble intention is entirely to plead for the lives of the dying people. May the people of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party accept it.</p>
<h3>Peking University Female Student Rape Case: US Military Tribunal Opens Trial, Continues Today, Ms. Shen Decides to Appear in Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] The case of the American soldier raping Peking University student Shen Chong was publicly tried at 9:00 AM on the 17th, and continued on the 18th. The victim, Ms. Shen, appeared in court on the 18th as a witness.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The US Marine Corps First Division stationed in China organized a military tribunal to publicly try the case of American soldier Corporal Williams Pearson's atrocities against Peking University student Shen Chong in the Dongdan drill ground on December 24, 1946, at 9:00 AM on the 17th. The military tribunal was composed of a presiding judge and six military judges, with Lieutenant Colonel Hughes as the presiding judge. At the opening of the court, prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Fitz Gerald attended with an assistant, and the defendant's defense attorney, Lieutenant Colonel Muster (the Fifth Regiment's Chief of Staff), also attended with an assistant. Pearson, as allowed by American law, sat on the lower side of the defense attorney. The court also had two clerks and three translators. The court was originally scheduled to open at 9:00 AM on the 17th, but was delayed until 9:30 AM for some reason. According to bystanders, those present included the defendant's guardian Shen Shao (Ms. Shen's father), Peking University President Hu Shi, Yang Zhenqing (Shen's cousin), Shen Chong's legal advisors Li Shitong and Zhao Fengjie, Zuo Mingzheng, Director of the Municipal Foreign Affairs Office, Meng Zhaoying, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Bureau, Lu Bindong, Secretary of the Foreign Affairs Office, Zhang Shuxian, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, Ji Yuan, Chief Prosecutor of the District Court, representatives of the 19th Regiment of the Military Police, and 27 Chinese and foreign reporters.</p>
<p>Judges Swear to Faithfully Perform Duties, Announce Five Counts of Defendant's Crimes</p>
<p>The trial dates are the 17th and 18th. The trial time today is from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 1:15 PM to 2:40 PM. The trial began with the presiding judge. All judges and clerks swore to faithfully perform their duties according to law, and then the prosecutor announced the opening of the court. (Central News Agency Note: According to the regulations of the American military tribunal, the prosecutor conducts the examination, and the victim is also one of the witnesses. The presiding judge is in a neutral position. Each witness being examined must be led by the presiding judge to swear an oath to express their willingness to tell the whole truth about the facts, otherwise they will be subject to legal sanctions). The prosecutor read the indictment, announcing five counts of the defendant's crimes: (1) Rape, (2) Coercive Rape, (3) Fornication, (4) Violation of Military Discipline, (5) Offense Against Public Morality. According to the investigation of the above five counts, among them, items 2, 3, 4, and 5, there are no appropriate equivalent terms in our country's laws. The translations of items 2, 4, and 5 are similar, but their meanings are not entirely the same as our laws. As for the third item, there is no suitable term to follow. According to the detailed explanation in the World Standard English-Chinese Dictionary, the word "Fornication" means "(direct sexual behavior between unmarried men and women)". Its legal meaning is also different from the ordinary dictionary. The translation of this agency is for reference only and should be based on the original text. After the reading, the defendant was questioned. The defendant denied committing the first, second, fourth, and fifth crimes, saying that although the third item could be admitted, it was only a response to the examination in the military tribunal and could not be admitted in the civil court.</p>
<p>Witnesses Testify in Succession, Recounting What They Witnessed</p>
<p>The prosecutor then successively summoned the witnesses. After each witness completed their testimony, the presiding judge asked the witness three questions: (1) Is there anything else you want to say? (2) If there is anything unclear in the court, you can explain it. (3) The situation in the court must not be directly or indirectly told to others. The witnesses who were summoned were: (1) Captain McNeir (Intelligence Officer of the Fifth Regiment of the US Marine Corps) presented a map of the scene of the incident involving the American soldiers. (2) Meng Zhaojie (Apprentice of the Motor Vehicle Repair Class of the Eleventh War Zone), who was the first eyewitness, said that at 8:30 PM on December 24th last year, he bought cigarettes in front of the Ping'an Cinema on East Chang'an Street and witnessed two American soldiers carrying a woman to the woods opposite the Ping'an Cinema. The woman was crying, so he invited colleagues Zhao Yuhua, Zhao Zetian, Ma Wenbin, and Qiang Zhixin. Two of the five people held flashlights. They saw an American soldier and the female student under the root of the wall in the South Dadi area from a distance of twenty feet. Another American soldier was about two feet away from them. They then returned to report to the two inspectors who were inspecting the Ping'an Cinema. The seven people went to watch again, but were driven away by the American soldiers. They then left and the five of them reported to the patrol at the south entrance of Wangfu that there was a woman crying at the location. After the prosecutor finished questioning, the defendant's defense attorney asked the same questions with similar results. Meng replied that he went to watch because he heard the woman crying in front of the Ping'an Gate. The situation of the American soldier's atrocities at that time was also as described above. The light at the location of the American soldier was dim, with no moonlight and no wind. (3) Qiang Zhixin (same occupation as Meng) testified that the situation of the American soldier's atrocities at that time was similar to Meng's. He saw an American soldier assaulting them and snatching a pistol from an inspector. (4) Ma Wenbin (Assistant of the Repair Class of the Eleventh War Zone) testified that he could not recognize the faces of the American soldiers at night. The glove he found when he returned to the lawn for the third time was picked up by Zhao Zetian. Other testimony was the same as Meng's. (5) Zhao Zetian (same occupation as Meng) testified that he and Meng were stopped by an American soldier for the third time in South Dadi. He recognized the glove in court and said that there was blood and dirt on the glove at that time. He heard the woman crying, but did not hear them talking. (6) Tang Wenhua (Private First Class of the Garrison Headquarters, i.e., inspector) testified that the American soldier who pushed them away had snatched his .38 caliber pistol. (7) Wang Tong (Sergeant of the Second Team of the Police Bureau's Patrol Brigade, transferred to the Garrison Department's military camp for joint unified patrol service) testified that he saw an American soldier and a woman being driven away by another American soldier with a flashlight. He also said that because of the language barrier, he did not force them. (8) Guan Dehou (First Class Police Officer of the Inner Seventh Branch) testified that at 10:30 PM that night, he received a report and went to investigate the matter. He heard a woman crying in South Dadi. When he approached, he saw an American soldier and a woman lying on the ground. He ordered the American soldier to get up in Mandarin. The American soldier responded with rude words. He grabbed the crazy people and protected the woman. At that time, the American soldier tried to hug the woman, but the woman hid behind him. Guan also testified that in addition to finding the American soldier and the woman because of the crying, he also saw a white object moving. At that time, the location was northeast of the empty room in East Dadi, 70 to 80 steps away from Hademen Street. After the American soldier found it, he reported it to the patrol car of the Sino-American Liaison Office in Dongdan. Guan finished the questioning and it was 12:00 PM. Break.</p>
<p>Ms. Shen's Spirit Was Stimulated, Holding Pants, Saying She Was Raped</p>
<p>The public trial continued at 1:15 PM in the afternoon. Hu Shi and He Siyuan did not attend to observe due to official business. (1) Liu Shangzhi (Battalion Sergeant of the 13th Company of the Security Police Team) testified that the American soldier was irritable and had a bad attitude. When he tried to escape, he blocked him with a gun. At that time, the woman was standing behind Guan, holding a white object in her hand. When he asked the woman, he knew it was her pants, so he told her to put them on. The woman told him that she had been raped. Cai Shaoming (Foreign Affairs Inspector of the Sino-American Liaison Office) then ordered her to put them on. The woman told him that she had been raped. (2) Cai Shaoming (Foreign Affairs Inspector of the Sino-American Liaison Office) testified that at about 10:30 (because he did not have a watch at the time), he was stopped by police officer Guan Dehou and others in the first patrol car in Dongdan, reporting that two American soldiers were carrying a Chinese woman and raping her in the field. They went together. At that time, they saw that the woman was wearing a dark coat, unbuttoned, with dirt on her clothes, face, and nose. Because her coat was unbuttoned, her clothes were disheveled and her hair was also disheveled. The back of her coat was damp and her expression seemed to be mentally stimulated. The woman claimed to be a "student of Peking Women's University" and her surname was Shen. Later, because of mental stimulation, she could not speak anymore. The American soldier was wearing a uniform coat and was empty-handed. In addition, Guan and others reported that they also picked up a glove with blood and dirt on it. Therefore, it was the jurisdiction of Zhang Yingjun, a clerk of the Second Patrol Army, so after Zhang arrived, he handed the case over to Zhang and others for handling. The defendant's defense attorney strictly asked whether he saw tear stains on Ms. Shen's face. He replied that he did not see them at the scene of the incident because the light was dim, but he saw tear stains on Ms. Shen's face when he went to the U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Headquarters where the light was sufficient. The report to the U.S. Military Police Headquarters and Zhang Clerk was based on the report of Guan and others, and its content was the same. At this point, the presiding judge announced that the trial would continue at 9:00 AM on the 18th.

<h3>Communist Army's Continuous Fierce Attacks Fail, Situation in Southern Shandong Becomes Deadlocked, Zaozhuang is Fortified, Jinxiang is Also Stable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 17th] The situation in Southern Shanxi is gradually becoming deadlocked. The battle for Zaozhuang was still fierce yesterday, but there were no major changes in the positions of both sides. Also, after Liu Bocheng of the Communist Army of Shanxi led 100,000 of his men to attack Jinxiang and were defeated, there are still battles taking place on the outskirts of Jinxiang. Zhang Taisheng's troops, who attacked Yongcheng, retreated on the 16th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] The Communist Army's offensive against Zaozhuang reached its peak on the 13th. Part of the Communist Army rushed to the outside of the Zaozhuang city moat on the afternoon of the 13th and engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand combat with the defending army, but was immediately driven back by the defending army. Because the Communist Army suffered heavy casualties, its morale is increasingly disintegrating, and they are all tired of war. Therefore, although the Communist Army continues to advance, it is ultimately at the end of its strength. At present, not only are we fully confident of holding Zaozhuang, but the situation in Southern Shandong will definitely take a sharp turn for the better in two or three days. There has been no major contact on the Linzi branch line and the Hezhao branch line in recent days, and the situation on the outskirts of Jinxiang is also stable.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] Today, the fighting in Southern Shandong has eased, and Taizao is also becoming stable. The Communist Army near the Zaozhuang coal mine was repelled by the National Army at noon on the 17th, and the situation in Taierzhuang is also calm.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 17th] The Communist Army attacking Zaozhuang launched another large-scale attack at dusk on the 16th, and bombarded the National Army's positions with mortars and other heavy fire, and the battle was extremely fierce for a time, and gradually subsided after midnight.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 17th] (1) Zaozhuang is still firmly defended by the National Army on the 17th. The continuous charges made by the Communist Army against the area have failed.

(3) The Communist Army attacking Yongcheng is still suppressed in the Dawangzhu area, fifty miles west of the city.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] It is reported that after the National Army recovered Zahe, the remnants of the Communist Army retreated to Jiwan.

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The Hewanzi railway bridge, 86 kilometers from the Jilin-Changchun line, was destroyed in two holes by the Communist Army before dawn on the 16th.

<h3>UNRRA Work-for-Relief Conference Concludes, Huo Director's Closing Remarks Read by Lu Guangmian, Hoping Everyone Will Work Hard, Be Optimistic, and Proactive</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The UNRRA work-for-relief conference continued for five days. Yesterday afternoon, after the final meeting, a closing ceremony was held. Director Huo was unable to stay for a long time due to business, and Vice Director Zheng presided over the ceremony on his behalf. First, Secretary-General Lu Guangmian delivered a speech, summarizing and reviewing the progress of the conference and expressing his gratitude to the representatives for their hard work. He hoped that all departments would strengthen their connections in the future to further improve work efficiency. He also read Director Huo's closing remarks, which roughly stated: "The work-for-relief conference has now come to a successful conclusion, and I am very pleased. I would also like to express my gratitude to General Egerton and the colleagues of UNRRA. The focus of this meeting is to discuss how to change from direct relief to work-for-relief and assist refugees in gaining self-reliance. After this meeting, the headquarters and sub-headquarters should be able to obtain closer connections. Whatever must be completed, we will immediately plan to carry it out and promote its realization, so as to provide assistance to the people and carry out construction work for the country. During this conference, I am very pleased that representatives from all parties came to Shanghai to participate and assist millions of unemployed refugees in restoring their productive capacity in a cooperative manner. Our assistance is temporary, because we enable them to obtain permanent productive capacity. During the conference, many technical issues were raised by all parties. Some have been resolved and some have been reserved temporarily. The headquarters hopes to resolve them in the shortest possible time. After you all return to your original places, I hope you will not forget the purpose of the work, which is to assist the people and is not temporary, but permanent. Therefore, it is necessary to consider methods so that the people to be rescued can become self-reliant. UNRRA's relief materials to China will gradually decrease in the future. We must prepare to use limited materials to relieve the huge number of disaster victims, so we must strengthen connections to complete the mission. I hope everyone will work hard, be optimistic, and proactive. Our work is an extremely important work, and it does not end here, but requires permanent effort."</p>
<p>Following Vice Director Zheng's speech, a representative of the members gave a reply. After the whole group took a photo, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] A responsible person from the government side told reporters that the Changchun military authorities' suspension of the Communist Party's radio station was entirely for self-defense. Recently, the Northeast Communist Army has concentrated 110,000 troops along the Songhua River, and a part has crossed the river to attack the south bank of the Songhua River.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the Yellow River embankment, UNRRA's chief engineer for the Yellow River, Todd, previously consulted with the government and requested a temporary suspension of work. At that time, President Song agreed to suspend work for two weeks from January 12 to 25. Later, Todd discussed this matter with the Communist Party, and the Communist Party requested a suspension of work for five months, so the proposal to suspend work for two weeks was abandoned.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Haiphong Suffered Heavy Losses, The Total Number of Casualties is Nearly 1,000, The Lives and Property of Overseas Chinese in Tokyo Are Also Extremely Critical</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th] Guan Jiarun, standing committee member of the Kuomintang's Haiphong direct branch, returned to China and arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago. According to him, the losses of overseas Chinese in Haiphong in the French-Vietnamese War included 23 houses completely destroyed, 168 houses partially damaged, totaling 8,976,725 Vietnamese yuan, property losses of 28,876,902 Vietnamese yuan, 317 men and 256 women missing, totaling 573 people, 29 men and 17 women injured, totaling 56 people, 161 men and 37 women arrested, totaling 198 people, 41 men and 36 women dead, totaling 67 people, a total of 894 people. The losses and casualties of those who fled with their families and were arrested have not been included. About 2,000 people fled to Jian'an, and most of them went to Nandinh, Ninh Giang, and Hanoi. Some took the opportunity to return to Haiphong. Those living in Hanoi were mostly taken in by the Hanoi Chinese Association Mutual Aid Society. About a hundred people who originally lived in An Yang fled to seek refuge. Although they are only separated from Haiphong by a river, the Vietnamese Self-Defense Forces do not allow them to cross the river, and they are almost out of food. The Overseas Chinese Relief Association is also unable to provide relief. Only the Haiphong Consulate General is negotiating, but has not yet obtained the essentials.

<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 16th] Menon, the first Indian ambassador to China, said in a solo interview with reporters, "I am very pleased to return to China, my second home.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Budget Problem</h3>
<p>The first session of the Shanghai Municipal Council can be said to be a major conference focused on discussing the municipal budget for the 36th year. However, after nine days of meetings, it was still impossible to balance the budget due to a large deficit in income and expenditure. How to increase revenue and reduce expenditure requires detailed discussion and cannot but be temporarily extended for several days from the 15th to await further research by the various subcommittee review committees. We certainly hope that the Municipal Council can find a way to make up for the budget deficit from an extremely difficult environment, while taking into account both the burden on citizens and the needs of municipal administration.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the total budget of over 230.08 billion for the Shanghai Municipal 36th year, plus the 20 billion for adjusting living subsidies, is no less than 250 billion. At first glance, it seems very large, but compared with the 75 billion in the second half of the 35th year, the 36th year should be doubled to 151 billion. The current figure is only 60% higher than this number, which cannot be said to be excessive compared with the general price increase. However, the important issue is not whether this number is necessary, but the following three points: (1) Can the citizens afford this number? (2) How can the burden on citizens be fair? (3) How should the city government use its revenue?</p>
<p>We believe that, first of all, it seems that the Shanghai market is declining, industry and commerce are depressed, taxes are heavy, and the people are miserable, with great suffering. In fact, most of the burden on Shanghai citizens is on the central treasury. For example, even in terms of direct taxes and commodity taxes, the burden on Shanghai citizens in one month, although there are no accurate statistics at hand, is probably greater than their burden on the municipal treasury for the entire year. Land tax and business tax were local taxes before the war, but according to the current financial income and expenditure system appendix, the central government still has to take 40% or 30% of these taxes. Therefore, the reason why the burden on Shanghai citizens is heavy is more than 90% for the country. We are by no means suggesting that citizens can pay less tax to the central government, but we cannot but point out that the burden on citizens for local municipal administration cannot be said to have exceeded the limit. Moreover, the responsibility for the formation of the situation of declining markets and depressed industry and commerce should be attributed to what party and is the result of what policy. Although opinions vary from person to person, it cannot be said that the municipal authorities should bear the sole responsibility. Frankly speaking, if this number of 250 billion is calculated at 8,000 times the general price level before the war, it is only worth 30 million before the war. Even if Shanghai citizens are becoming increasingly poor, they may not necessarily be unable to bear the burden. However, the burden on citizens must be fair, and the income from municipal taxes must be used appropriately, with one penny collected and one penny used.</p>
<p>Then we want to discuss the second point: To make the burden on citizens nearly fair, we must first advocate that the central government should immediately adopt the suggestion of the Municipal Council and, at a time when Shanghai's post-war vitality is declining and the central government has taken over a large number of materials, restore the system where local taxes before the war were entirely used by the local government, and no longer withdraw 40% from land price tax and 30% from business tax, so that the municipal treasury can be slightly less strained. According to the original budget proposal submitted by the municipal government, the funds for these two withdrawals should have reached 20 billion. Moreover, according to the estimates of the budget subcommittee of the Municipal Council, both taxes can still increase by more than 30 billion. If the estimate is not far from the truth, then the municipal treasury's revenue can be increased by 50 billion. In other words, it is reasonable to slightly reduce the burden on citizens to the central government and slightly increase their burden on local municipal administration. Secondly, since entertainment tax and banquet tax are local taxes, the tax rate should be determined by the local government through the resolution of local public opinion organs. In a society like Shanghai, where extravagance is commonplace, if the tax rate is adapted to local conditions, there is plenty of room to consider re-grading these two types of taxes, and the provisions of the highest amount should be determined according to the degree of excessive luxury. On the one hand, we want to promote a simple and plain new life, but on the other hand, the central government legislates to limit the tax collection method that can imply prohibition, which is really a pity. Finally, we believe that the municipal construction donation and the public utilities surcharge for municipal construction donation, although these two types of donations and taxes are local special taxes in this city, in terms of their collection targets, standards, and methods, rather than being harsh taxes, they are no less than good taxes. As long as the tax rate is appropriately stipulated and the rent is accurately estimated, it is most fair to make citizens with certain living abilities determine the amount of their burden on municipal expenses according to the level of their burden on rent. Moreover, the tax collection procedures are simple, the administrative expenses are small, and it is more beneficial to the municipal treasury. We want to advise the Municipal Council that, when reviewing, just be selfless, appeal to reason, and then the wise decision can be understood by the citizens. As for the national compulsory labor substitution fee, that is a special provision based on the National Compulsory Labor Law. Its meaning is not so much in the "substitution fee" as in "compulsory labor." Compulsory labor should be a commendable policy during the post-war construction period in China, which can only be proud of its "abundant manpower." However, this should not be regarded as a problem of making up for the budget. We are willing to write another article to discuss it.</p>
<p>The third point is the central issue, which is to ask: How is the city government's tax revenue distributed and used? We have generally observed the discussions of the Municipal Council and the opinions of the general public, and we are not necessarily shocked by the huge total budget, but we deeply regret the excessive number of redundant personnel and parallel agencies, resulting in a disproportionate ratio of administrative expenses to business expenses. If the municipal authorities can see the depths of the citizens' hearts, adhere to the spirit of "like what the people like," and, with the support of the Municipal Council, make a firm decision to adjust the organization and eliminate redundant personnel, it is better to pay more and use fewer people than to use more people and pay less. Using one person has the use of one person, and doing one day has the merit of one day, and greatly changing the phenomenon of layered institutions and cumulative personnel that has occurred since the autumn and winter of the previous year, then the citizens will be deeply aware that most of the taxes they pay are used for the cause they look forward to and need. The psychological comfort will be indescribable. As long as the city government collects taxes and makes progress day by day, the roads will not be uneven, the ditches will not be filled with sewage, the garbage will not pile up, the feces will not be visible, the traffic will not be blocked, the schools will not refuse to accept school-age children, and the registration of land documents will not be delayed for several months. Such facilities that citizens look forward to and need, with the efforts of necessary employees, will be promoted and realized one by one, instead of using most of the citizens' taxes for the living expenses of employees and the administrative expenses of the agency. We believe that the Shanghai municipal budget can be passed by the Municipal Council and can also be understood by the city's 4 million citizens.</p>

<h3>Under Public Opinion Supervision, Longhai Railway Vigorously Rectifies, Cleans Up Vehicles, and Strengthens East Section Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou News] The Longhai Railway is one of the main transportation lines in the country. Since the restoration, due to the imperfect road facilities, everything has been simplified, which has been criticized by merchants and travelers. In particular, the two overturns at Jiaokou last year have aroused social dissatisfaction. Lu Futing, director of the railway administration, was dismissed because of this. Recently, under the supervision of public opinion, the bureau has vigorously rectified, and the road administration has improved day by day. Regarding the renovation of bridges and tunnels on the entire line, due to material problems, it is not possible to start construction on all of them. The first step is to repair the bridges along the river to ensure the safety of travelers. This work has now begun, and the project is progressing very smoothly. It is expected that Bridge No. 8 can be rebuilt by the end of April of this year, and the Black Stone Pass Bridge can be completed before the end of June. As for the Zhongmou Bridge, there is no obstacle to the Huayuan driving. In addition, in order to save transfer time, once the above projects are completed, not only will the entire line be unobstructed, but also night driving will be unimpeded. In addition, in order to save transfer time and make it convenient for merchants and travelers, it is also planned to lay seven tracks across Zhengzhou, and the project is under measurement. Regarding strengthening transportation, the most difficult thing at present is the east section. Prices west of Kaifeng are therefore rising sharply. In order to solve this difficulty, the bureau is rapidly clearing accumulated vehicles, trying to vacate the occupied space at each station on the entire line, and quickly repairing those that are damaged, so that the surplus vehicles can be allocated to stations east of Zhengzhou. On the one hand, it will lease two locomotives from the Jinpu Railway Bureau to restore the Longhai-Jinpu combined transportation and strengthen the east section transportation. In addition, the bureau has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to find a way to allocate locomotives to meet the needs. In addition, the year-end bonus for employees of the railway in the 35th year has been stipulated by the Ministry of Communications to be issued at half a month's salary for December. The railway bureau follows the Ministry's year-end bonus issuance method, stipulating that those who have served until the end of December for six months will receive the full amount, those who have served for three months will receive half of the amount, those who have served for more than one month but less than three months will receive one-quarter of the amount, and those who have served for less than one month will not receive it. The standard of this bonus, before the announcement of the new treatment, will be temporarily issued according to the average of the total amount of the treatment in December of the 35th year (including living subsidies, salary increases, and an additional 30%, etc.).</p>

<h3>One Act Leads to Another: Township Head Runs Rampant, Commits Adultery with Daughter-in-Law and Assaults Nephew, Fires Shots as a Show of Force, Frames with a Knife</h3>
<p>[Report from our Dangtu correspondent] In Xijie, Bowen Township, in this county, gunshots suddenly rang out late at night on the first of this month, causing panic among the people of the town. Initially, they suspected bandits, but after an hour, they learned that the gunshots were fired by Chen Rihong, the township head. It turns out that Chen, the township head, had been playing cards day and night at the home of Zhang Minggui, a butcher in the town. Recently, he had an affair with Zhang's daughter-in-law. That evening, Zhang's entire family went to Shijia Village to mill rice, leaving only Zhang's mother at home. Chen, the township head, took the opportunity to sneak into Zhang's residence for a rendezvous with his daughter-in-law. After about an hour, Zhang's nephew returned home and heard a man's voice inside his brother's wife's room. He opened the door and saw the township head in the act. Unable to escape, the township head fired a shot inside the room, scaring Zhang's nephew away. He then took the opportunity to flee back to the township office, where he immediately sent township guards to fire shots as a show of force and arrest Zhang Minggui's nephew for a brutal beating. Later, because the incident was major, he sent township guards to bring the butcher knife he used to the station, using it to falsely accuse Zhang's nephew of murder with a knife. The next afternoon, at 6:00 PM, Zhang Minggui's sister-in-law went to the township office to negotiate with Chen, the township head, for compensation for her son's medical expenses for his injuries. The atmosphere at the township office was filled with foul play, and the people of the entire township were filled with hatred and indignation upon hearing of the matter.</p>

<p>[Report from our Ningbo correspondent] Zhu Hongshan, a major bandit in Siming Mountain, had been entrenched in the mountain, committing acts of rape, robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. After repeated orders from the Siming Mountain Pacification Commander Xuan Xiangxiao, subordinates finally carried out a rigorous suppression. It has been learned that on the evening of December 31st of last year, the Yin County Police Bureau's security police learned of Zhu's whereabouts and went to encircle him. After an hour of fighting, Zhu Hongshan was shot and wounded. Reports of his immediate death on the scene were inaccurate. He escaped to Hongling, Cinan, for medical treatment. Someone secretly reported this to the Zhejiang Security Brigade. Brigade Commander Mao Shunzhi, after receiving the report, led his troops to surround the area on the 12th of this month. More than fifty bandits resisted, but the bandits were outnumbered and defeated. Bandit leader Zhu Hongshan was being carried away by a bandit when he was shot in the head and fell to the ground. After the bandits scattered, it was too late in the evening to pursue them. The battlefield was cleared, and three bandit corpses were found. Zhu Hongshan, the bandit leader, was positively identified on the spot by the local township chief, and his head was cut off and presented to the First Brigade Headquarters of the Zhejiang Security Force. After the Brigade Commander Wang Zichen confirmed his identity, the head was hung at Tongqu in Liangnong for public display. A report was also sent to the provincial peak for verification. Zhu, who was in his thirties and a native of Cixi, claimed to be the Director of the Logistics Department of Siming Mountain and concurrently the magistrate of Cixi County. After his death, the news spread, and everyone rejoiced.</p>

<h3>A Suggestion from a Young Person Who Has Dropped Out of School</h3>
<p>We are a group of young people who have already started working but have dropped out of school. In today's society, "qualifications" and "knowledge" are exceptions, but this will eventually be eliminated. We are aware that our knowledge is too shallow to be of use to us, and because we do not have "qualifications," we do not have the opportunity to develop. Aren't we, these young people playing this role, finished? Therefore, we demand that a night middle school, night university, treat night school students with the same qualifications and status as regular middle and university students. To satisfy our desire for knowledge and the qualifications of middle and university graduates, we hope that this demand will be realized. Please come forward to support those who feel the same way, and ask the members of the council to speak out for the out-of-school vocational youths in Shanghai. (Out-of-School Vocational Youth)</p>
<h3>Simplification of Identity Card Issuance Needed</h3>
<p>The national identity card is proof of identity for the holder. All Chinese people have the obligation and the right to apply for it. The government has repeatedly ordered that the issuance of identity cards to the people should be done as soon as possible and should not be delayed. However, despite the orders, it is still not possible for the people to quickly obtain an identity card. The reader applied for an identity card on November 30th of last year. The application form has been sent to the baozhang's office for more than a month, but has not yet been received. I have visited the baozhang three times, and according to the baozhang's reply, "The application form has been sent up, and it must be stamped by the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government and sent down to the district office. The procedures are complicated, and I don't know when it will be issued." As small people, we do not know how "complicated" the procedures are, but more than a month cannot be considered short. Can't these "complicated" procedures be completed? The government orders "swift" processing, but it takes more than a month. If it is not "swift," wouldn't it take a year to receive it? I hope that the agencies handling national identity cards will "comply with the situation and respect the law," strive to simplify the procedures, and issue them quickly, without adhering to the old habits of government offices and delaying them through unnecessary steps. At the same time, please answer when the identity card we applied for in November can be issued? (Li Zihe)</p>
<h3>Mail on Behalf</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Yao Lichu: Your letter regarding the fee charged by Instructor Chen Yi has been forwarded by our office to the Education Bureau. The Education Bureau's Secondary Education Office has sent a letter to the Municipal First Normal School for investigation. According to the school's reply: "It has been found that for all municipal middle schools in this city, the tuition fees for this semester were collected after the middle of November, taking into account the burden on students' parents due to the dedication of Zunshi gold at the beginning of the semester. What our school collected was the above-mentioned tuition fee, not the second tuition fee. This is one point. The collection of tuition fees is a matter of the city's treasury, and our school is not in a position to refuse. However, children of public educators or students from poor families can apply for exemptions. More than half of the students in our school this semester applied for exemptions from Zunshi gold equipment, etc., and exemptions were granted for all or part of them after considering the circumstances, without anyone being left out. This shows that there were no violations in this tuition fee collection, and no one was suspended from school. This is the second point. There is no Yao Lichu among the parents of our school's financial aid students, and no one lives at 100 Dagu Road. It is clear that the anonymous claims are not true. This is the third point."

<h3>Treaty of Peace with Germany and Austria Should Be Participated in by the Five Great Powers, We Have Submitted a Memorandum to the Four Powers, and the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting Allowed Austria to Attend and Make a Statement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th dispatch] Regarding the drafting of the treaty with Germany and Austria, it is learned that the Chinese government has separately submitted memorandums to the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, requesting participation in the drafting work. It states that, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the peace treaty with Germany and its vassal states should be drafted by a meeting of the five powers. In the past, when the four deputy foreign ministers held a meeting in Paris in 1946, China also submitted a similar note to the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th dispatch] According to reliable sources, although China has received an invitation to present opinions on the German and Austrian treaties to the current meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers in London, the Chinese government has decided not to present such opinions to the meeting at this time. The Chinese government firmly maintains that the entire procedure for concluding the German and Austrian treaties, including the procedure for convening a peace conference in the future, should be agreed upon by the five foreign ministers' meeting before it can be decided and implemented.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 16th dispatch] The memorandum of our country's opinions on the German peace treaty, drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived at our embassy in the United Kingdom yesterday and will be submitted to the meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers currently being held in London.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th dispatch] The four foreign ministers' representatives' meeting on the German issue was held for two hours today. The meeting decided on the order in which small countries would be invited to present their opinions: Poland—January 20th afternoon, the Netherlands—January 21st afternoon, Yugoslavia—January 22nd afternoon, Australia—January 23rd afternoon, South Africa—January 24th, Canada—January 25th. There was no agreement on whether other small countries could be present when a representative of a small country presents their opinion, or whether documents submitted by one country should be circulated to other countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th dispatch] The four foreign ministers' representatives agreed today to invite Austria to attend consultations on the Austrian treaty and agreed that the Austrian treaty should be called "the treaty for the reconstruction of an independent and democratic Austria." In other words, the treaty is not a peace treaty but a national treaty. The US representative, General Clark, commander of the US forces in Austria, then announced the withdrawal of the US draft treaty on Austria and stated that a new draft treaty would be submitted within a few days. The United Kingdom will maintain its original draft treaty, and France will also submit its French draft treaty on Austria within a few days. The deputy foreign ministers' meeting has received applications from Yugoslavia, Poland, Canada, Australia, and South Africa to attend and present opinions on the Austrian treaty. The above-mentioned countries may present their opinions first, and Austria will be the last country to present its opinions. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev proposed that the four powers and Austria should be listed as the countries that signed the treaty in the preamble, and other countries should be included in a special section of the treaty, but the four powers did not reach an agreement on this.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Demands Territory, Austria Decides to Reject</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Yugoslav Capital, 16th dispatch] Regarding the Austrian treaty, Yugoslavia has sent a memorandum to the meeting of the four foreign ministers currently being held in London. This memorandum was recently published by the South. It states that Austria should be held responsible for Germany's aggression against the South, its occupation of its land, and its forced naturalization of its people. Therefore, it makes the following two demands: (1) The Slovenian Kalensia region should be returned to the South. (2) Croatians who have been naturalized as Germans should be given a special status to protect their national rights and to allow them to exchange with Austrians within the South's borders. In short, the Allies should give serious consideration to the South's demands.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th dispatch] Official sources here: The Austrian government has prepared a detailed reply to Yugoslavia's demand to acquire the two provinces of Kalensia and Styria in Austria and is preparing to present it when the four deputy foreign ministers' meeting invites it to present its opinion. Well-informed sources said that the Austrian government will reject the South's demands for the following reasons: (1) Kalensia is an integral part, and in no way can it be divided. (2) The national nature of Kalensia was determined after a plebiscite held after the First World War. It is reported that the Austrian government will strongly declare the indivisibility of Kalensia geographically, administratively, and economically.</p>
<h3>Belgium and Brazil Submit Opinions on German Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Brussels, 16th dispatch] Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak said today that Belgium's demands on Germany could be presented to the four deputy foreign ministers' meeting in London on Monday. The Belgian Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee resolved today that German property established in Belgium during the war should be regarded as Belgian property and should not be used as German reparations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th dispatch] Brazil's demands on Germany were submitted to the four deputy foreign ministers' meeting today by the Brazilian Chargé d'Affaires Gutierrez. Brazil believes that in order to obtain more effective cooperation in the discussion of the treaty, not only should small countries be allowed to present their opinions, but they should also be allowed to have the opportunity to discuss the opinions of other countries. Brazil hopes that Germany will one day become an integral part of a peaceful international order so that it will not launch another war of aggression.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Demands on Svalbard Island are Under Serious Consideration in Norway</h3>
<p>Will Appeal to the United Nations if Necessary</p>
<p>[United Press, Oslo, 16th dispatch] The Norwegian Foreign Ministry issued an official report stating that Parliament is currently considering the Soviet Union's recent demand at the United Nations General Assembly in New York to resume negotiations and jointly manage Svalbard Island in terms of defense and economy. Norway is willing to sign an agreement with the Soviet Union on the military base on Svalbard Island if the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, and other relevant countries express their approval. These countries are all signatories to the 1919 treaty that transferred Svalbard to Norway. In addition, Japan and Italy, the Allied Powers during World War I, are also signatories. The treaty stipulates that military bases or military facilities cannot be built on the island. If the Soviet Union insists on its demands, it may appeal to the United Nations for resolution. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry's announcement also stated that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had requested Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange to reopen negotiations.</p>

<h3>French President Takes Office and Delivers Inaugural Address: Willing to Serve the Country with All His Might, Blum Submits Resignation in Accordance with Constitutional Regulations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th dispatch] Felix Ohryar, the president of the French Fourth Republic (according to a notification from Agence France-Presse, the new French president, Oliver, will be renamed Ohryar from today), held an inauguration ceremony at the Palace of Versailles today.

Within the scope of our policy, we will live in peace and cooperate with our friendly countries." Regarding domestic policy, "I will faithfully protect the French Constitution and ensure that it is respected by the people in spirit and in writing. I will do my best to support the French Republic. Once in danger, I will cooperate in defending it. I hope that all members of parliament and all political parties will cooperate with me. The peaceful coexistence of all political parties is necessary for democracy. If we are driven by emotions, it will be more harmful than beneficial." Afterwards, President Ohryar and Prime Minister Blum rode in a car to the presidential palace. The people along the way cheered and saluted him. All civil and military officials stood respectfully at the gate of the presidential palace to welcome him. Shortly after entering the presidential palace, he came out again and went to the Bourbon Palace to rest for the night.

<h3>Soviet Union's New Decision on Germany: The United States Believes It Violates the Four-Power Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 17th dispatch] The Soviet authorities announced a plan to increase the industrial production of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany by two to three times, which came as a surprise to US Commander Clay and other United Nations representatives. Clay has asked the Soviet representative to the United Nations Control Council for Germany to explain this at the next meeting. According to the United States, in accordance with the original four-power agreement, German industrial productivity should be reduced by 35 to 50 percent. This plan seeks to make German industrial production exceed pre-war levels, which is undoubtedly a fantasy and a violation of the four-power agreement. The plan was published by a Soviet-sponsored social unity party newspaper, foreshadowing the Soviet Union's intention to reach an agreement with other occupying countries at the Moscow foreign ministers' meeting to obtain compensation from Germany's existing production, which would be beneficial to the Soviet Union because it is feeling a shortage of domestic consumer goods.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th dispatch] After President Ohryar was elected President of France, the provisional government since the liberation of France came to an end. In accordance with constitutional regulations, Prime Minister Blum submitted the resignation of his cabinet to the President of the Republic. It is believed that the President will still appoint Blum to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th dispatch] A joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives today elected the president of the French Fourth Republic. Socialist candidate Ohryar won 452 votes out of a total of 883 votes and was elected.

Now, the Navy Department has expressed its agreement and has jointly submitted the legislation to President Truman for him to promulgate and implement. Truman has replied to Patterson and Forrestal, expressing his pleasure at the agreement between the Army and Navy, and acknowledging that the merger plan agreed upon by the two departments is indeed feasible.

<h3>The Japanese Political Situation Takes Many Twists and Turns; the Coalition Cabinet is Stillborn</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 17th] In order to overcome the so-called national crisis, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida sought to recruit the Socialist Party and the Liberal and Progressive conservative parties to form a "national unity cabinet." Since December of last year, he has been negotiating with the Socialist Party for a month and a half. However, due to the strong opposition of the Socialist Party's left wing, the conditions put forward by the right wing to Yoshida have inevitably been gradually raised. The list of proposed cabinet members included left-wing elements, which did not receive understanding from the government and the party. In addition, after investigating the qualifications of Nishio and Hirano, the secretaries-general of the Socialist Party who were preparing to join the cabinet, it was found that they were not eligible to be cabinet members. As a result, Yoshida abandoned his plan to change the political situation and retreated to strengthen the policies of the Liberal and Progressive parties, hoping to break through the difficulties. The cabinet declared this point.</p>
<h3>Franco-Vietnamese Negotiations May Resume</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] The French cabinet communiqué stated: France is willing to resume free negotiations with the Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh. The cabinet members listened to the report by the Minister of Colonies, Moutet, on the situation in Vietnam.

<h3>The President of Vietnam Personally Supervises the Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Hanoi, 16th] Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, is personally commanding the Viet Minh army at the Haitang Command Post, seven miles southwest of Hanoi in the North. The army continues to fight the French army. However, French officials say that there is no precise information about Ho Chi Minh's whereabouts. Ho may still be in the military, but he is being held hostage by extremist leaders. Since the attack on Hanoi began on December 19 of last year, the Viet Minh army has been under the control of extremists, and Ho Chi Minh himself may be under the guard of the extremists and not at the command post. The French policy, in regards to the attack on Hanoi, clearly does not want to criticize Ho Chi Minh personally, so that when the situation permits, negotiations with him can be resumed.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Guerrillas Intensify Activities</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Saigon, 16th] The terrorist activities of Vietnamese guerrillas are intensifying daily and have now spread to the Cambodian border. Some evidently want the French to know that the cost of a colonial war is even greater than the cost of recognizing Vietnamese independence.</p>

<p>[United Press International, New York, 17th] "Collier's" magazine, published on Thursday, recently carried an article by Kohtane, stating that Soviet scientists at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute are researching ways to allow deadly solar ultraviolet rays to pass through "gaps" in the Earth's atmosphere and instantly destroy any enemy country. "If the power of ultraviolet light is concentrated and passed through the atmosphere to illuminate any enemy country, it will be enough to destroy that country and all its inhabitants, as if crushing dry weeds and rotting wood."</p>
<h3>From a British Perspective on Allied-Occupied Japan (1)</h3>
<p>— Original by John Morris, Translated by Zhang Deqian</p>
<p>I previously translated the article "Japan During the Occupation," which appeared in this newspaper from November 17th to 19th last year. It was originally written by Parrott, the "New York Times" correspondent in Tokyo, and provides a glimpse into an American perspective on the occupation of Japan. Now I have also found an article in the British authoritative magazine "The Fortnightly Review" November issue titled "Japan Under Allied Occupation," which is quite representative of a British perspective. I am translating it again for readers to refer to.</p>
<p>(1) Current Situation of Japan</p>
<p>Before the war, I lived in Japan for four years. I only left Japan eight months after the Pearl Harbor incident, in July 1942. At that time, the living conditions in Japan were already extremely difficult. Tokyo had been bombed once by General Doolittle, but that bombing was just a demonstration. The last time I passed through Tokyo's city center was on a bus in a concentration camp, on the way to the pier to board a prisoner-of-war exchange ship. At that time, although Tokyo appeared dilapidated, it was still a city, with seven million people living, working, and entertaining there.</p>
<p>I recently returned from Japan, where I lived for six months. What impressed me the most was the ruin and damage that had occurred in the past four years. During the war, I closely followed the situation in Japan. I had formed a fairly clear image in my mind, assuming that Japan should always be like that. But it was completely different from the actual situation.</p>
<p>To understand the current situation in Japan, we cannot use our knowledge of the destruction in Europe to estimate it. For example, London, even after the most brutal air raids, still had something left; maybe all that was left were some cellars or outer walls, but at least you could still tell what the place was. In Japan, it is completely different. You have to understand that very few buildings in general Japanese cities are made of steel and concrete. The remaining 90 percent, whether they are houses, shops, or even factories, are made of wood. Only Kyoto in Japanese cities has never been bombed, and many large towns have not been bombed either. The center of Tokyo, around the Imperial Palace, although bombed, is still much the same as it was before the war. There are some ruins here and there, but generally speaking, it is similar to the less bombed areas of London. This area is mostly occupied by banks and large businesses; now almost all of it is used as barracks for the occupation forces. Loafing around the streets, with the sound of Allied military music constantly blaring from the loudspeakers, and idle GIs leaning against the walls in contemplation, this scene is no different from any smaller city in Denver or the British Midwest. You still see a few Japanese people, who seem to have wandered into this area by mistake.</p>
<p>Today's Tokyo is Completely Different</p>
<p>But outside that area, the scene is completely different. The Japanese used to call Tokyo the third largest city in the world. Now, apart from that surviving small area, the rest has simply been destroyed. In the three major bombings last year, everything was burned to ashes. The destruction of Tokyo is almost like the destruction of the ancient city of Carthage. What is strange is that although the streets are so dilapidated, they still exist, and electric trams are still running. There are also a few dilapidated buses running. But there are no taxis. To ride a tram, you have to stand in line for an hour or two before you can get on. All the seats in the tram have been removed to accommodate more passengers, and even the footboards are crowded with people. Fainting and injuries are common. Because of the excessive load, the tram can barely climb on slightly sloping streets. The subway was very clean and good before the war, but now the situation is almost the same as above ground. The stations are dirty and dark, and the smell in the tunnels is like a large sewer, making you feel like you are traveling through rubble. The names of the districts are naturally still the same, but there is nothing that can make you recognize what place it is.</p>
<p>Most Citizens Live in the Suburbs</p>
<p>Before the war, Tokyo had a population of about seven million. Now it has been reduced to about three million, most of whom live in the distant suburbs that have been somewhat undamaged. People who work in the city center (the occupation forces naturally have to hire many Japanese) have to spend five or six hours on the road every day. The small houses originally intended for one family are now inhabited by a dozen people. Although the Japanese have never been as concerned as we are about living separately and not disturbing each other, if they continue to live like this, I don't think they will undergo the necessary social and intellectual changes that will enable them to occupy a place in the peaceful and democratic world in the future.</p>
<p>There is naturally much more to write about this, but my purpose is only to outline the background for the occupation forces to carry out their work, so I will stop here.</p>

<h3>Foreigners Involved in Lawsuits in China Are Not Allowed to Bring Translators; We Are Not Bound Before the Sino-US Treaty is Ratified</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since China abolished unequal treaties and extraterritoriality, foreign nationals from Europe and the United States have been subject to Chinese law in lawsuits in Chinese courts, and all their treatment is equal to that of Chinese citizens. Recently, Mr. Smith, the Director and General Manager of the Shanghai-based American firm, Marti Yang Company, was summoned by the Shanghai District Court on November 4 of last year. The District Court rejected his request to bring his private translator. Because Mr. Smith was not proficient in Chinese, he did not understand the content of the written record of his testimony after the interrogation. The District Court ordered him to sign the record according to the law, which caused a dispute over "treatment." The details of the situation were reported by Mr. Smith to the US Consul General in Shanghai, who forwarded the report to the US Embassy. The US Embassy made representations to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office has received instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to inquire about the details of the case. The translated excerpts of the US Embassy's note to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the full text of the Ministry of Judicial Administration's instructions to the High Court are published below:</p>
<h3>Translation of the Note from the US Embassy</h3>
<p>Translation of the note: "On November 26 of this year, Dr. Cheng Ximeng, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Chen Shilin, Assistant Officer, met with Mr. Burton, Deputy Commercial Attaché of the Embassy, to discuss the matter of Mr. Smith, the Director and General Manager of the American firm Marti Yang Company in Shanghai, being summoned by the Shanghai District Court, and the treatment he received when he appeared on November 4 of this year. According to Director Cheng's statement, the US Consul General in Shanghai reported the details of the case, as well as Mr. Smith's request to be accompanied by his legal counsel or translator when attending the interrogation, which was not approved, and the fact that he had to sign a Chinese record whose content he could not confirm after the court hearing. A copy of Ambassador Stuart's letter of November 8 of this year is enclosed. The Ministry is aware that the recently signed Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation (Article 6, Section 4) stipulates that nationals of either contracting party shall have the freedom to select and engage lawyers, translators, and representatives when exercising or defending their rights in court. Although this treaty has not yet been ratified by both parties, the Embassy believes that even if either party does not comply with its actual provisions, there is a moral obligation to abide by its spirit. Based on this view, the Embassy requests that the Ministry bring the case of Mr. Smith to the attention of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, so that Chinese courts will adopt less arbitrary measures before the aforementioned Sino-US treaty is exchanged and ratified. It would be deeply appreciated if the Ministry would give sympathetic attention to this case. December 5, 1946."</p>
<h3>Reply from the Ministry of Judicial Administration</h3>
<p>Ministry of Judicial Administration, January 4 of this year, Jing (36) Xun Can Zi No. 8: "The case is based on the public letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mei San Wu No. 13835, dated December 16 of this year. The US Embassy's (note) concerns the matter of Mr. Smith, the Director and General Manager of the American firm Marti Yang Company in Shanghai, being summoned by the Shanghai District Court, and the treatment he received when he appeared in court on November 4 of this year. The Embassy requests that the Ministry of Judicial Administration pay attention to this matter, so that Chinese courts will take less arbitrary measures before the Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation is exchanged and ratified, etc. A copy of the original letter from the US Consul General in Shanghai reporting the case, and a letter from Mr. Smith reporting his experience, addressed to the Consul General, are enclosed to the Ministry. It is found that the aforementioned Sino-US Treaty has not yet been exchanged and ratified, and has not yet come into effect. In law, our government is not yet bound by it. In addition to informing the personnel of the US Embassy of this view, the original note and a translated copy are enclosed, along with a copy of the original letter from the US Consul General and the original letter from Mr. Smith. Please investigate the details of the case and reply as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Difficulties Arise in the Collection of Public Utility Surcharges</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has reported to the Municipal Council yesterday that difficulties have arisen in the collection of public utility surcharges, requesting a resolution. The reasons are as follows: (1) The US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai refuses to pay the public utility surcharges. Please consider whether it is necessary to list them on their bills and, if so, negotiate with the US military authorities. The Bureau has received a report from the Shanghai Gas Company stating that the company received a letter from the US Navy stating that the surcharge could be waived. (2) The Wusong Gas Company is experiencing great difficulties in collecting surcharges from military users, and has requested the Municipal Government to consult with the Songhu Garrison Command for assistance. (3) According to a report from the Shanghai Power Company, the company has received a letter from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) stating that, in accordance with the agreement between the agency and the Chinese government, they are exempt from all taxes and surcharges. How to handle this matter? Please clarify. The above issues were discussed at the Municipal Council meeting yesterday, but no decision was made. What will happen next is currently unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Over 10,000 Unemployed Workers from the Rear Areas in Shanghai Struggle on the Brink of Starvation, Residing in Shabby Dwellings, with Two to Three Deaths Daily, Representatives of the Delegation Host a Press Conference and Appeal</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The delegation of unemployed workers from the rear areas who have come to Shanghai, numbering over 10,000, are living on the brink of starvation. They appeal for resumption of work and relief. Yesterday, they hosted a press conference at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Tibet Road, reporting on their current living conditions and expressing their desire for work. According to the general secretary of the delegation, since December of the year before last, over 10,000 workers have come to Shanghai from the rear areas. Except for over 300 who have found ways to return to work on their own, the vast majority are still unemployed, and workers continue to arrive from the rear areas. The reception center set up by the Social Affairs Bureau can only accommodate over 3,000 people, and the center is dilapidated with broken walls, extremely dirty, with men, women, old and young, living in the same room, lacking medical equipment. An average of two to three people die every day. The monthly allotment of over 20 catties of macaroni from the Relief Administration often comes half a month late, and there is only 100 yuan for daily food expenses. The poor quality of the food is unimaginable. The Relief Administration of the Executive Yuan has issued over 1,000 coats, but most are moldy, and two-thirds are for women. The representative wept as they reported on the painful living conditions. The representative also stated that the Social Affairs Bureau had promised to set up a cooperative hardware factory to provide jobs and had promised to lend each person 300,000 yuan of small-sum loans in October last year, but nothing has materialized to this day. The delegation put forward specific appeals: (1) Please request Director Lei to follow Article 7 of the new regulations for worker rehabilitation promulgated by the Executive Yuan, which stipulates that wartime production laborers have priority in returning to work, to guarantee and introduce them to state-owned factories for rapid resumption of work. (2) Please promptly devise winter relief for unemployed workers who have come to Shanghai from the rear areas. (3) Please promptly increase the medical and health personnel and equipment in the reception centers to save lives.</p>
<h3>The Address of the Regiment Headquarters Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Chuan Zhengmo, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, previously went to Nanjing to request instructions regarding the office address of the Headquarters and the Shanghai Regiment Headquarters. The matter has been officially completed, and he returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday morning. He immediately met with Fang Ying, Commander of the First Naval Base, to inspect the former Naval Hospital on Kunming Road. It is reported that Kunming Road has been decided as the location for the Shanghai Regiment Headquarters. After some clearing, it can be moved in and formally operate within days. As for Tongji Road, although it has been decided as the location for the Garrison District Headquarters, there are many naval dependents currently residing there, and it may be difficult to move in and operate for the time being. The Garrison District Headquarters will temporarily operate at the First Supply District Headquarters reception center, and negotiations with the Navy are ongoing. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the people in the garrison district thoroughly understand the meaning and detailed methods of conscription, Commander Chuan Zhengmo has decided to conduct extensive publicity before conscription. He has already printed a type of Conscription Law and distributed it to district, township, and village offices and Baojia (households), for posting and reference, so that the people in the garrison district understand the true meaning of conscription, and the age and branches of the military service.</p>
<h3>The New Sino-French Air Route, Official Launch Date Still Awaiting China's Decision</h3>
<p>The French Far East Aviation Company specially dispatched a DC-4 type F-BBDE jumbo jet, departing from Paris, via Saigon, Hong Kong, etc., to Shanghai at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, in order to inspect the air route between Vietnam and China. The equipment and decoration inside the aircraft are quite beautiful. The aircraft is scheduled to return to France from Shanghai on the 19th of this month. The reporter specially visited Mr. Tuo Liqi, the chief inspector responsible for the company's Shanghai office, yesterday. He said that the French Far East Aviation Company decided to open a new air route between China and France for the purpose of opening up air transport between France and China. The F-BBDE is the first visit to China, and will continue to visit China in the short term after returning to France, in order to establish close contact with the Ministry of Communications of the Chinese government. As for the official launch date, according to the provisions of the Sino-French aviation agreement, the airlines of both countries must launch and take off at the same time. Therefore, the launch date of the French Far East Aviation Company depends on the decision of the Chinese government. The official launch can only take place after China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) or Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) participates in the flight. However, Chinese aircraft can only fly to Vietnam, Saigon, or Hanoi, as the aviation agreement does not stipulate flights between China and Paris. As for the ports in China that the French Far East Aviation Company will pass through, they must also be determined by the Chinese government before they can be announced.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the China National Aviation Corporation had aircraft flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, before the conflict between the French and Vietnamese armies, but it was suspended due to the outbreak of war. Based on this fact, the air route between China, France, and Vietnam in the future may be undertaken by Chinese companies.</p>
<h3>British-Gifted Warship "Fubo" Sails to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The British-gifted warship "Fubo" returned to China from the United Kingdom and sailed to Nanjing via South China. The Naval Headquarters has made appropriate adjustments to the personnel on board. It is now learned that the warship was led to Shanghai by the newly appointed Captain Jiang Yu the day before yesterday and is currently docked at the Huangpu Road Naval Pier. After a brief resupply, it will sail to the Gaochang Temple Jiangnan Shipyard for inspection and repair.</p>
<h3>The Resolutions of the Land Administration Group of the Municipal Council Have Been Finalized</h3>
<p>The Secretariat of the Municipal Council has been actively working on various post-meeting tasks in recent days and finalized all the resolutions of the Land Administration Group yesterday. They will be submitted to the Municipal Government today for forwarding to the Land Administration Bureau for strict implementation.</p>
<h3>Feng Qinzao and Kong Decheng Travel to Tianjin by Ship Together</h3>
<p>General Feng Qinzao, former Chairman of Chahar Province, and Kong Decheng, a descendant of Confucius from Qufu, Shandong, attended the National Assembly in Nanjing. After the closing of the National Assembly, they arrived in Shanghai last week. In view of the continuous aircraft accidents, they decided to travel north by ship. It is reported that the General Affairs Office of the Municipal Government has purchased tickets for the "Hai Xiong" from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on their behalf, and they boarded the ship and set sail for Tianjin together yesterday.</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks Act as Agents for Tax Collection</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] In order to facilitate tax payment for citizens, the Municipal Finance Bureau has entrusted six commercial banks to temporarily collect taxes on behalf of the City Bank. All taxes and levies in this city have long been collected by the City Bank acting as an agent for the Municipal Treasury. Thirty-two collection branches have been set up in various districts of the city to handle collection and remittance matters. Now that the business tax, house tax, and municipal construction levies have been levied, in order to facilitate payment for citizens, in addition to the Jiujiang Road Main Branch and the original collection branches continuing to collect and remit, all the bank's First Office at 247 Yu Garden Road, the Third Office at 509 Zhonghua Road, and the Third Office at 509 Zhengdong East Road will also collect taxes. The bank also believes that the urban area is vast and there are many taxpayers. In order to prevent citizens from being crowded and waiting for a long time, or feeling inconvenience, it is decided from this year to temporarily entrust the Zheshang Industrial Bank Head Office (230 Jiangxi Road), Zheshang Industrial Bank Dongmen Road Branch (61 Dongmen Road), Xinhua Bank Sixth Office (451 Zhengzhong Middle Road), Siming Bank Nanjing Road Branch (470 Nanjing East Road), China Industrial Bank Caojiadu Branch (451 Kangding Road), Four Banks Savings Association (170 Nanjing West Road), and China General Chamber of Commerce Bank Yangshupu Office (Fishing Market) to collect taxes separately.</p>

<p>[Our Own Report] At about 11:30 AM yesterday, a tea server, Lu Honggao, at the Natural Restaurant at the intersection of Guizhou Road found a six-inch pistol under the legs of a round table while moving the round table behind the escalator.

Suddenly, a thief threw a bag of ashes at his eyes. Xing was caught off guard and wiped it with his hand. The thief immediately snatched the money bag and fled. Xing disregarded everything and bravely chased after him, finally capturing the thief. He handed the thief over to the police officer on duty and took him to the Huangpu Sub-bureau for interrogation. The thief confessed his name as Yin Hangui and admitted the robbery without denial.</p>
<h3>British Destroyer to Visit Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The British Far East Fleet Command will send two destroyers, "Black Goose" and "Constance", to Shanghai for a friendly visit. The two warships are expected to arrive here on the 20th of this month and are scheduled to stay for eight days before returning to their original defense. It is reported that the "Black Goose" participated in the Battle of Norway in the early days of the war and later served in the Irish Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, shooting down twelve German aircraft and two submarines. In October of the 30th year of the Republic, it was sent to participate in escort work between Liverpool and Gibraltar. After Germany surrendered, it returned to the UK for repairs and was transferred to the Far East Area in June of the year before last. This is its third visit under the leadership of Captain Deng Fushi Light. The "Constance" transported British Ambassador to China Sir Steve and his wife from Hong Kong to Beijing last year to take office. This is its second visit to Shanghai. The ship's captain, Geli Caolai, has made many great achievements during the war and enjoys a high reputation in the British Navy.</p>
<h3>People Occupying Municipal Real Estate Must Declare and Register Within February</h3>
<p>Regulations for Rewarding Reports of Concealed Public Land</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Municipal Real Estate Management Measures and the Shanghai Municipal Reward Measures for Reporting Concealed Public Land were jointly drafted by the Land Administration Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau. They were reviewed and approved by the Regulations Committee and the Land Administration Committee of the Municipal Council. From the date of passage of these measures, anyone occupying municipal real estate must report to the competent bureau within two months for registration and processing. Those who fail to report within the deadline will be ordered to vacate the land, pay back rent, and be fined ten times the rent payable from the date of occupation, and those with serious circumstances will be prosecuted for encroaching on public property. In order to encourage the reporting of concealed public land, it is stipulated that if the reported concealed public land is verified by the Land Administration Bureau and becomes municipal property, the reporter will be awarded a bonus of 20% of the estimated value of the land, which will be allocated by the Land Administration Bureau with the approval of the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>During the Lunar New Year, All Shipping Lines Will Operate as Usual, and the Railway Bureau Will Add Special Trains for Returning Home</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration added special trains for returning home in order to clear transportation during the Lunar New Year. However, the ticketing situation was extremely chaotic, greatly affecting the order of the station. Therefore, the "Ticketing Measures for Special Trains for Returning Home" were specially formulated. Passengers on special trains for returning home must purchase tickets to the terminal station of each train, regardless of which station they get off at. However, for fourth-class special trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, tickets can only be issued if there is a fourth-class fare established between each stop and the terminal station. Tickets for special trains for which the fare is not specified in the fare table will not be issued. Furthermore, the 92nd and 94th express trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line are extended runs of regional trains, so tickets will be issued as usual. In addition, all special trains for returning home will be handled in accordance with the current express train ticketing procedures.</p>
<p>In addition, the bureau believes that as the end of the year approaches, passengers will inevitably carry various firecrackers on the train, which can easily cause danger. Therefore, it is strictly forbidden to carry them. If anyone is found carrying them on the train privately, the firecrackers will be confiscated and they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>[Another Report] As the Lunar New Year is approaching, shipping lines in this city, according to past practice, are preparing to close and take a vacation. Shipping lines usually begin to suspend operations several days before Lunar New Year's Eve. According to sources in the shipping industry yesterday, the industry is continuing to operate as usual because the passenger and cargo traffic on the northern and southern oceans and the Yangtze River is very crowded this year. However, it will be prepared to suspend operations for a few days during the Spring Festival holiday to allow sailors and others to return home for reunions and to clean up the interior of the ships.</p>
<p>The shipping industry's business was quite developed last year, and the number of ships operating on each line gradually increased. However, most private shipping companies had no profit due to high expenses and low freight and fares.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Shen Zhongyi, Deputy General Manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, told a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday that the company will continue to operate as usual during the Lunar New Year and will not take a vacation. However, if passenger and cargo traffic on each line decreases, the schedule may be delayed. Currently, the shipping on each line is normal. There will be a passenger ship sailing to Taiwan from the Shanghai-Taiwan line next Monday.</p>
<h3>Jumping from a Building and Taking Poison</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Le Lishui, 43 years old, a technician at the Public Works Bureau, lived at 48, Lane 510, Datong Road. His family burden was very heavy, and he became even more strained as the end of the year approached, so he developed thoughts of death. At about 6 AM yesterday, when people were unprepared, he jumped from the drying platform, seriously injuring himself. He was rushed to the hospital, but treatment was ineffective and he died soon after.</p>
<p>Zhu Qingyu, a local, took Lysol without knowing what stimulation he had received at 8 AM yesterday morning. Fortunately, it was discovered early and he was rescued.</p>

The next morning, he swallowed a large amount of Lysol and committed suicide. Fortunately, the tea server found him and sent him to the hospital for treatment. He is still in a coma and his life is feared to be in danger.</p>
<h3>The Coal Briquette Price Review Committee Decides on the Composition of Coal Balls, Warnings or Penalties Will Be Imposed for Insufficient Quality</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The sixth meeting of the Coal Briquette Price Review Committee was held at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. More than ten representatives attended, including Gu Bingyuan and Yang Jusong from the Social Affairs Bureau, as well as coal briquette retailers, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Fuel Management Committee, the Coal Briquette Industry Association, the Coal Industry Association, and the Municipal Council. The following decisions were made: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau will announce the types of coal briquettes sold by retailers and factories to the public. (2) Regarding the composition of coal briquettes, it is stipulated that it should be 50% coal cinder, 50% coal dust, and 10% mud.

<h3>Impersonating a Police Inspector, Holding a Show of Stolen Goods at the Pawnshop, Staging a New Drama, Stealing a Radio</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] New tricks for swindling are emerging one after another. In the morning the day before yesterday, two people wearing black uniforms suddenly arrived at the Yongxing Pawnshop at 103 Yu Garden Road, escorting someone who looked like a petty thief. They claimed to be police inspectors from the Xinshijie Police Sub-bureau, ordered to bring the thief to display stolen goods. After speaking, they slapped the petty thief twice and asked if he had been here. The petty thief repeatedly said yes and kept calling for help from "uncles". The play was so realistic and vivid that the pawnshop owner, Jiang Yongyi, believed it was true and quickly invited the "police inspectors" inside to sit down, offering tea and cigarettes, fearing negligence. At this point, the "police inspector" took out a pawn ticket from his pocket. After Jiang inspected it, it was indeed issued by the pawnshop on January 5th, for a radio, valued at 300,000 yuan. At the same time, the ticket had the words "Stolen Goods" written on it, so he was even more convinced that it came from the police station. He ordered a shop assistant to go upstairs and take out the original pawned radio. The "petty thief" first recognized it, and then it was handed over to the "police inspector". At this point, the three had finished their play and achieved their goal, so they left. Before leaving, they only left a note with the words "Jin Musheng, Criminal Division, Xinshijie Sub-bureau" as a token. Yesterday, the pawnshop owner, fearing that the 300,000 yuan would be lost, ordered shop assistant Weng Honggui to go to the Xinshijie Police Sub-bureau to inquire. After searching the entire bureau, there was no "Jin Musheng" and no such display of stolen goods. Then he realized that he had been fooled and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau, requesting investigation.</p>
<h3>A Villager Detained for Illegally Possessing Firearms</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Old Gate Sub-bureau received a secret report the day before yesterday, asking them to search for illegally possessed firearms at 5 Deyuli, Zhizaoyi Road, Nanshi. The police officers rushed to the house and found two automatic and selective fire submachine guns. They took the young woman Chen Mao to the bureau. She claimed that she did not know who had thrown the firearms into the house during the enemy puppet period, and because the villager was ignorant, she had illegally possessed them until now. The rest of her testimony was vague and will be investigated in detail before being processed.</p>
<h3>A Comedian Meets a Comical Incident, a Foolish Thief Steals Rocks from a Rockery</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Shen Xiaoting, a comedian, lives at 35, Lane 31, Puan Road. Because Shen's income is quite high, his house is luxuriously furnished. The living room has a pewter candle holder weighing over 20 catties, a stone-copper Buddha statue weighing about 50 catties (installed with a mahogany frame), and a rockery, etc., of great value. Unexpectedly, at about 6 AM yesterday, after the maid got up, she found that the door was wide open and that a thief had broken in. All the Buddha, pewter candle holder, rockery, etc., were stolen. The owner, Shen Xiaoting, has reported to the Taishan Sub-bureau requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>A Heartwarming Act Amidst the Winter Relief Efforts, Donating Seven Mu of Land to Help the Poor</h3>
<p>The grand Peking opera benefit performance organized by the Fundraising Committee of the Municipal Winter Relief Association, following the charity dinner dance, has come to a conclusion after eight days. The first four days were performed at the Tianchan Stage, but the results were not as good as expected due to the rain. The last four days were moved to the China Grand Theater, and the situation improved. The total ticket revenue for the four days was about 150 million.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association received a deed for six pieces of private land, totaling seven mu, seven fen, four li, and seven hao, from Zhu Xiaofang, Executive Director of the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, through Director Shi of the Land Administration Bureau yesterday. He generously donated the land because he saw that the poor were suffering from hunger and cold and feared starvation. The original letter said: "Your association has launched a winter relief effort to benefit poor compatriots, which I deeply sympathize with. I have specially enclosed six pieces of real estate in Hangzhou, along with all the property certificates (a list is attached separately). Please check and sell them separately. All proceeds will be donated to show my meager effort. Please investigate accordingly." It is now learned that the list is as follows: (1) An empty lot of nine fen on Jiulingsong, Lingyin Road, Hangzhou, surrounded by mountains on three sides, near the road, with elegant scenery. (One each of the two maps of the two municipalities, the third map, the eighty-seventh map, one each of the grain storage certificates, and one of the first contracts under Zhu Huairen's name.) (2) An agricultural land of one mu and one thousand and sixty-five on the church bridge in the Hangzhou Songmucang (one each of the two maps of the two municipalities, the first map, the eighty-one thousand and seventy-sixth map, one grain completion certificate, and one contract under Zhong Heji's name.) (3) A miscellaneous land of five fen and thirty-two near the Songmucang along the road outside the Hangzhou Qiantang Gate (one each of the two maps of the two municipalities, the first map, the two hundred and seventeenth map, one grain completion certificate, and one each of the transfer of the upper contract.) (4) A tea land of one mu and one hundred and eighty-five in Xixili, Liuxia, Hangzhou (one each of the maps of the eleventh municipality and the eleventh map, the six hundred and tenth map,) one grain completion certificate, and one transfer of the upper contract (5) A tea land of one mu and one hundred and forty-four in Xixili, Liuxia, Hangzhou (one each of the maps of the eleventh municipality and the eleventh map, the six hundred and seventh map, one grain completion certificate, and one transfer of the upper contract (6) A tea land of two mu, three fen, two li, and five in Xixili, Liuxia, Hangzhou (one each of the maps of the eleventh municipality and the eleventh map, the seven hundred and eighty-third map, one grain completion certificate, and one transfer of the upper contract). The above four, five, and six total four mu, six fen, and five li of tea land. It is also learned that when Director Zhu was raising donations for the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association, he also generously donated a Western-style house to benefit the people, which is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Hateful Mistake</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Wang Xuehou, 26 years old, from Nantong, lives at 50 Yangjia Lane, Julu Road. His wife, Ms. Li, has a daughter named Rudy, who is just one year old. At about 5 PM on the afternoon of the 14th, Liu Suwen, a young woman from Dongtai, 18 years old, from 58 in the same lane, came to Wang's house to play. Ms. Li was holding Rudy in her arms, and because of housework, she asked her to hold the child. Tang Zuxing, 20 years old, a pianist who lived on the third floor, was going out. Tang and Ms. Liu knew each other. They met next to the escalator. At first, they joked with each other, and then they started to move their hands and feet. Accidentally, Ms. Liu lost her hand and Rudy fell to the ground, immediately losing consciousness. Later, she was accompanied by her mother to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 10 AM the next day. The hospital reported to the Lujiawan Sub-bureau, ordering officer Dong Qixiang to arrest Tang Zuxing and Liu Suwen to the bureau, accusing them of manslaughter.</p>

<h3>The Third Trial of the Zang Da Erzi Case: The Accused Appears in Court for the First Time; U.S. Navy Petty Officer Luther Called to Testify, Claims He Acted in Self-Defense When He Hit the Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] In the tragic death of Zang Da Erzi, Luther, a U.S. Navy Petty Officer from the USS Helen, was summoned by the court yesterday to testify for Lai Lingnai. At 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Yanlin temporarily convened the court for questioning. Due to the short notice, the victim's family was not informed, and only their attorney, Chen Zhen, appeared. Luther, escorted by U.S. Navy Major Johnson, testified: He is 25 years old, an American citizen, a Petty Officer on the USS Helen, commanding 32 soldiers. He first came to Shanghai on September 18th of last year, staying for only a month before leaving, and returned three months later. On September 22nd, at 10:00 PM, he went to the "Bi Du" (a place), and also went to a bar, but did not drink or go upstairs. Upon entering, he saw Lai Lingnai drinking. Although they were not acquainted, they left at about the same time and he saw a rickshaw puller demanding money from Lai, who claimed he had already paid. The puller continued to harass him and struck Lai Lingnai, who did not retaliate. Therefore, he struck the rickshaw puller once, causing him to fall to the ground. The court questioned him: Since Lai Lingnai was a stranger to you, why did you hit the rickshaw puller? Luther replied: Because at that moment, I considered Lai to be a friend.</p>
<p>The court then inquired about the U.S. military court's investigation. Major Johnson stood up and stated: The evidence in this case has been fully collected and the investigation has concluded, but no verdict has been reached. The verdict needs to be reported to Washington before it can be decided. The court instructed: According to Article 4, Section 2 of the Regulations for Handling Criminal Cases Involving U.S. Military Personnel in China, this court has the authority to inquire about the case's progress. The court then asked Johnson: Since the investigation is complete, under what legal article is the accused being prosecuted? Johnson replied: For murder. He was then asked about the motive. Johnson replied that it was self-defense and there was no instigation. The court continued: This court has sent two letters requesting a response, but we have not received a reply. Why? Johnson replied: Copies have been sent to Mayor Wu and the U.S. Consulate for forwarding, and they should arrive soon. He also stated that Luther will soon be deported back to the U.S. and will not be able to testify in court again. As witnesses Zhao Adi and two others were not present, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. Lai Lingnai, suspected of instigating the murder, also requested a confrontation yesterday, claiming that he no longer recognized Luther. Lai fully believed that he would be released after this general amnesty. However, the most severe penalty for his crime is imprisonment, so he can only have his sentence reduced, not be pardoned, and was returned to custody after questioning.</p>
<h3>Zheng Liangbin's Retrial: Chen Chunpu Summoned to Testify</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Zheng Liangbin, suspected of being a traitor, continued in the High Court yesterday with witness testimony. The defendant, Zheng Liangbin, from Ningbo, had worked in the shipping industry for many years. In March of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), he defected to the enemy, serving as the Chief of the Ship Department of the enemy's Central China Shipping Company, General Manager of the puppet National News Agency, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the puppet Political Council, and Director of the Shanghai Office of the puppet Construction Department. The defendant had a fresh haircut, a flat-top style, a fair complexion, and wore a blue cloth gown. He admitted to holding puppet positions but claimed that the General Manager position at the puppet National News Agency was merely a nominal title because Li Shiqun had asked for money and he had donated 50,000 yuan to the agency. He stated the position as Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the puppet Central Political Council was merely a title and he never received a salary.</p>
<p>The accuser, Zhang Yishi, stated: I filed the accusation because the defendant seized my ship. The seizure occurred in the 28th year of the Republic (1939), before the defendant held any puppet positions. All the puppet positions listed are accurate. He presented the defendant's business card with his titles. The court instructed that regarding the seizure, because it occurred before the defendant held any puppet positions, a civil suit could be filed separately. Chen Chunpu, who had already been sentenced to death, was then brought to testify. Chen was emaciated, with gray hair, wearing a blue cloth gown and worn-out cloth shoes. Chen testified: The defendant and Chen Chunpu were friends before the war, and Chunpu arranged for him to become the Director of the Shanghai Office, connecting him with the Shanghai shipping industry.</p>
<p>The case should have been concluded yesterday, but at the request of the defendant's lawyers, Zhang Shizhao and Chen Tingrui, two more important witnesses needed to be summoned. The hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zunyue's Trial Continued Yesterday: Closing Arguments, Sentencing on the 24th</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday heard the case of Zhao Zunyue. The defendant, from Wujin, 50 years old, a graduate of Nanyang Public School, had worked as a reporter for Shen Bao before the war and as a Councilor and Chief of the Propaganda Section of the North China Political Affairs Commission and as a Councilor of the Ministry of Railways. After Shanghai fell, the defendant returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and, at the persuasion of Wang Jingwei, joined the puppet organization, successively serving as a member of the puppet Political Council, Vice Minister of the puppet Ministry of Railways, Political Commissioner of the puppet Executive Yuan, Secretary-General of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Central Political Council, and Minister of Propaganda, until the end of the war.</p>
<p>In response to the indictment, the defendant stated: The defendant has always been a staunch supporter of the resistance against Japan. During the January 28th Incident (1932), I participated in the Shanghai National Disaster Relief Association. After the outbreak of the war, the defendant went to Hong Kong twice to prepare for the publication of Shen Bao. Later, due to my father's illness, I returned to Shanghai. Wang Jingwei met me at the Yuyuan Road, Lane 226 and persuaded me to join the puppet organization. Because I was not a member of the Kuomintang, I was appointed as a member of the puppet Central Political Council, with nothing to do. The council only handled routine matters such as personnel reports and filings. The power over the railways was in the hands of the enemy's Central China Railway Company, and the puppet Ministry of Railways had no authority to intervene. Although I wanted to reclaim the railway management rights, the enemy did not agree. Later, because the puppet Ministry of Railways had no work to do, it was abolished. I was transferred to be a nominal Political Commissioner of the puppet Executive Yuan, which was just a figurehead position. The Executive Yuan had no office for political commissioners, and I never reported for duty. During my tenure as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, I handled the affairs of the Secretariat, and the original bureau chiefs remained unchanged. The increase in land tax, house tax, and business tax were directly submitted to the puppet mayor by the puppet Finance Bureau, and the records can be checked. The revision of textbooks was carried out during the time of the Reformed Government. The defendant converted public schools into private schools to avoid using these textbooks. Regarding the construction of roads to facilitate enemy military transport, the puppet government had no funds for construction at the time. The organization of the Baojia system was not intended to restrict the activities of underground workers. The individuals who cracked down on underground workers were enemy military police and secret agents. Later, I was transferred to be the Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Central Political Council, which was an idle position with nothing to do. In February of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), Propaganda Minister Lin Baisheng resigned, and the defendant was appointed as the puppet Minister of Propaganda. I consulted with Commissioner Xu of the Military Affairs Commission beforehand and obtained his permission before taking office. Because I had a private radio station to communicate with the Central Government and provide information to the rear, the position of puppet Minister of Propaganda could provide cover.</p>
<p>The defendant's lawyer, Zhang Shizhao, argued: Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases states: "Assistance in the war effort or actions beneficial to the people may be considered for reducing the sentence." The defendant privately established a radio station to provide information to the rear, as testified by Tao Guang and Wang Yaoqin. During the defendant's tenure as Secretary-General of the puppet Municipal Government, there were no actions detrimental to the people. One should not ask about the position held within the puppet government, but should examine their actions. Do not only ask about puppet officials, but ask whether they did good or harm. Even if the defendant cannot be found not guilty, his sentence should be reduced. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated: Please pay attention to the defendant's motive, facts, and attitude after the fact when determining the sentence, and be particularly lenient.</p>
<p>At this point, Judge Liu announced: The arguments in this case are concluded, and the sentencing will be on the morning of the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Local Court Begins General Amnesty: Eighty-One Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] After receiving the State Council's gazette containing the General Amnesty Order, both the High Court and the Local Court have formally accepted the order. Except for the sentence reduction part that still awaits instructions from the Ministry of Justice, the amnesty part has officially started yesterday. The Local Court yesterday brought in a total of 108 prisoners from the Shanghai Prison and Detention Center. Eighteen people were acquitted and released, sixty-three were released on bail, and twenty-seven were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Preventing Traitors from Swindling with Impunity</h3>
<p>The local court of this city, in view of the General Amnesty Order issued by the National Government and published in the State Council Gazette, whereby those criminals who meet the criteria for amnesty or sentence reduction will be released or have their sentences reduced in batches according to the law, is deeply concerned that unscrupulous individuals may take advantage of the situation, swindle, and deceive. Therefore, a public notice is issued stating: "According to the General Amnesty Order issued by the National Government on New Year's Day of this year, except for war criminals and those who have committed treason, corruption, murder of direct lineal ascendants, manufacture, transportation, and sale of opium, establishment of places for opium consumption, and addiction after repeated prohibition, all crimes committed before December 31st of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945) where the most severe original sentence is imprisonment or less are amnestied. Where the most severe original sentence is imprisonment or more, or with a concurrent fine, the sentence may be reduced in accordance with the regulations. All criminal cases handled by this court, those eligible for amnesty or sentence reduction, are currently being processed for release from prison and for the preparation of sentence reduction by the presiding judge in accordance with the provisions of the law. This national amnesty is truly a generous act of grace. All defendants should wait patiently for the judgment and not be impatient or deceived by others. If there are unscrupulous people who take advantage of the situation, swindle, and extort, you are permitted to submit a written report directly to this court, and we will thoroughly investigate without leniency. This is a public notice for general information."</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Practices in the Liquor Industry's Rotating Credit Associations: The Association Sends a Letter Requesting Sanctions</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Li Youcai, Chairman of the Shanghai Fen Liquor Industry Association, and Zhang Shuen, Dai Chunfeng, and others from the association, sent a letter to the District Attorney's Office yesterday, stating: Since the victory, the practice of rotating credit associations has become prevalent, affecting members of our association. Due to poor business conditions, they are unable to bear the exploitation of high-interest loans, resulting in numerous business failures and disputes. At the request of affected members, the association intervened to mediate. After investigation, it was discovered that Hui Kang Liquor Store, China Company, Da Zhonghua Liquor Store, and Chen Zhaoyang, Hu Bogui, Xu Shaoyun, Wang Yumei, and others, after obtaining the funds from the credit associations, secretly remitted the funds back to their hometowns to purchase property, leaving only empty storefronts in Shanghai as a means to liquidate debts. It is estimated that the total amount of funds exchanged among members of the industry is in the billions of yuan, with over 300 businesses affected. If this trend is not curbed, it will affect social stability. The association has decided at a meeting that any member who remits large sums of money back to their hometown to purchase property with the intention of defaulting on debts in Shanghai, or who intentionally stops or delays payment of credit association funds or debts under the pretext of owing debts, will be reported by the association to the Municipal Government, the City Council, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the District Attorney's Office for strict sanctions and legal action, and will also be publicly announced in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Wu Suiren's Case of Misappropriating Public Funds for Private Lending to Be Heard Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Wu Suiren, Chief of the Treasury Section of the General Administration, who misappropriated 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for private lending at high interest rates, is scheduled to be heard by the Local Court today. Wu submitted a statement of defense yesterday, in which he stated: "The misappropriation of funds was originally intended to establish a low-interest microloan program. Although there is a crime of unauthorized disposal of public funds, it only constitutes a dereliction of duty and does not fall under the anti-corruption regulations cited in the indictment. He also stated that he immediately confessed to the director, Huo Baoshu, in writing after the incident and returned the funds in full.</p>
<h3>The Scandalous Murder Case in the Sheet Metal Shop: A Ripple Across a Pool of Spring Water; She is Killed for Her Beauty; A Rickshaw Puller Defends the "Xi Shi"; A Friend Interferes, Originally Out of Love Sickness</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] On December 13th of last year, an unidentified male corpse was found in front of No. 198, Kaixuan Road. The Changning Road Branch Bureau dispatched officers to transport the body to the morgue for examination, but because no family members claimed the body, it was collected for burial. It has now been learned that the deceased was named Wu Tiegen, 32 years old, from Songjiang, and had worked as a clerk at the Cao Litai Sheet Metal Shop, owned by Cao Chunsheng, located at No. 448, Fuxing Middle Road, for over ten years. After the death of his first wife, the shop owner Cao Chunsheng cohabitated with a woman surnamed Wang, 43 years old. Wang had a daughter from a previous marriage, named A'mi, whom Cao raised. She was renamed Cao Jing and is now 18 years old, with a beautiful face, known as the "Sheet Metal Xi Shi." Wu Tiegen pursued her but was rejected. Next door to the shop was a flatbread shop owned by Wei Changzhi. Wei's son-in-law, Zhao Fusheng, also known as Ma Xiaofuzi, 27 years old, earned a living as a rickshaw puller and had a good relationship with Jing. One day, Wu Tiegen caught a glimpse of them together, and jealousy flared up. He reported it to Cao's mother, who scolded A'mi. From then on, Wu Tiegen and Zhao Fusheng became enemies. Zhao Fusheng repeatedly threatened Wu, demanding that he forcibly borrow 1 million yuan, claiming he would kill Wu if he didn't. Wu Tiegen was terrified and searched everywhere for a loan without success. Unexpectedly, he was murdered under the bamboo fence of the Anping Coffin Repository on Kaixuan Road. Wu Tiegen's older brother, Wu Chuncai (39 years old, currently a gatekeeper at the Zhonghua School, No. 596, Qipu Road), learned of this and reported the details to the police, who immediately arrested Zhao Fusheng for investigation and submitted a report to the District Attorney's Office, requesting a second autopsy. The District Attorney's Office granted the request, and yesterday morning, the Tongren Fuyuan Hall dispatched workers to return the coffin to the morgue. At 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Shen Zuocai, along with forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Xi Zihui, arrived to take their seats. After briefly questioning the deceased's brother, they entered the morgue and ordered the workers to open the coffin and remove the body. The forensic doctor first dissected the head, removing the brain. Three black spots were found on the frontal bone of the head, and a bluish-purple bruise was found on the back of the head. The chest was then dissected, and the heart, lungs, and other organs were found to be intact and undamaged. The examination lasted for two hours before it was completed. When the examination was conducted, reporters were also present to observe. The body was swollen and bloated, emitting a foul odor, and looked very gruesome. According to the forensic doctor, whether the deceased was beaten to death or died from other causes will have to wait for a clear determination after further examination. The body has now been re-coffined by the deceased's brother in a newly purchased coffin.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Panic Alleviated: Rationing Rumors Completely False</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] On Wednesday and Thursday of this week, a gasoline panic occurred in the city. Rumors abounded, with some hoarding gasoline and others selling it on the black market, with prices soaring to 5,000 yuan per gallon. According to an investigation, the shortage was due to the failure to obtain import permits for the Asiatic Petroleum Company and Socony-Vacuum Oil Company in time. However, yesterday, things returned to normal, and the oil drums sealed by customs have also been opened. However, because there was no gasoline available for two days, many vehicles were waiting to refuel, causing temporary congestion.</p>
<p>The two companies are now transporting large quantities of gasoline from Pudong via barges and distributing it to gas stations in the city through Yangshupu. Regarding gasoline imports, the Provisional Import Control Committee had previously included it in the list of restricted imports, stipulating that government and military agencies have the highest priority, and gasoline companies have the last opportunity. However, the supply of gasoline is not based on a rationing system. The rumors that rationing will be implemented are completely false. Furthermore, during this period of shortage, the Texaco company was not affected in any way and continued to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Five Errant Employees of Yonghe Industrial Company Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Due to a dispute over year-end bonuses, a labor dispute broke out at Yonghe Industrial Company. Five labor representatives, Tong Fukui, Wei Ruoxu, Wu Boshou, and others, engaged in over-the-top actions, surrounding the factory and cutting off food and drink to the management, and obstructing workers from resuming work. The Garrison Headquarters arrested the five individuals yesterday and brought them to justice. The company has two factories with over 400 workers. They went on strike on the 4th of this month, demanding that the company pay a year-end bonus equivalent to three months' salary. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated, ordering them to resume work first, but the labor representatives refused. Under these circumstances, the two sides continued to negotiate, with the labor representatives finally agreeing to reduce the bonus by two days, but the negotiations broke down. The Social Affairs Bureau then stepped in to arbitrate. While the arbitration was in progress, the labor representatives surrounded the management from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, cutting off their food and drink, and forcing the management to sign an agreement to pay a year-end bonus equivalent to two months and twenty-eight days' salary. Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, and Director Wu, upon hearing this news, deemed the actions of Tong and the others to be over-the-top. In addition to approving the company's dismissal of Tong and the other five, they ordered the Garrison Headquarters to arrest and severely punish them yesterday.</p>
<h3>Nile Road Dispute at Wing On Company Under Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] When the employees of Wing On Company were about to go on strike the day before yesterday to demand a year-end bonus, Section Chief Fan Zhenbang of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau personally went to the company to advise against the strike action. It is understood that: (1) The labor representatives of the company are demanding a year-end bonus of 35 days' salary, while the management is willing to pay 30 days' salary; (2) The employees' salaries are divided into 23 grades, and the labor representatives are demanding a year-end grade-level bonus. The management is willing to raise the lowest four grades, levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to Section Chief Fan of the Social Affairs Bureau, the above two items are expected to be agreed upon by both parties.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the Wing On Company employees' request to the company for advance payment of bonuses, it is understood that: The company's employees had requested a double salary year-end bonus in December of last year. The company's management issued a double salary bonus of one month across the board on December 26th of last year. Now, the employees are requesting advance payment of bonuses. However, the company believes that according to company law, the bonus needs to wait until the year-end final accounts are completed, audited by an accountant, and resolved by the board of directors before it can be handled according to the regulations. However, they are willing to advance a loan of 1 million yuan to ordinary staff and 150,000 yuan to trainees. The employees are insisting on an advance payment of one and a half month's salary.</p>
<h3>North China Daily News Labor Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The typesetters of the English-language North China Daily News went on strike the day before yesterday without negotiating with the management or showing any intention to have the municipal authorities mediate or arbitrate, causing the newspaper to fail to publish the day before yesterday. However, yesterday, they all returned to work and the newspaper was published as usual. The newspaper had previously paid the workers a double salary as a year-end bonus and, as usual, prepaid half a month's salary for January. They also set aside one day for the Lunar New Year holiday. However, the workers again requested that the newspaper cease publication for seven days during the Lunar New Year and requested a loan of 300,000 yuan. The management believed that the city's Newspaper Association and municipal authorities had no regulations regarding Lunar New Year holidays, and the year-end loan was also without reasonable basis. Therefore, the management firmly rejected these requests.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after mediation by the Printing Industry General Union and the municipal authorities, and stern instructions to the workers that they should not make such unreasonable demands, the labor representatives accepted the terms and began to resume work. The management will not pay salaries to any of the workers for the strike period because the workers went on strike without following the legal steps of mediation.</p>
<h3>Maritime Patrols Intensified: Smuggling Incidents Gradually Decreasing</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] According to Chen Changrui, Deputy Commissioner of Customs of the Anti-Smuggling Section of the General Directorate of Customs, recently, maritime patrols in Shanghai have been strict, and smuggling incidents have gradually decreased. In the coastal areas of North China, due to the incomplete restoration of commerce, smuggling incidents are still not common. However, in the South China area, with convenient land and water transportation and numerous ports, the trend of smuggling in South China is currently more rampant than in Shanghai and North China. After the State Council specially approved the "Provisional Measures for the Customs to Temporarily Borrow Naval Vessels and Assign Customs Officers to Board Naval or Military Vessels and Investigate Smuggling by Military Personnel," the Guangdong Customs has reported that they have seized smuggled cotton yarn, cigarettes, and other contraband imported by personnel from a certain supply district command, with a very large value. The General Directorate has sent a reply ordering a detailed report on the circumstances of the seizure and the value of the smuggled goods.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Section, in view of the fact that the measures for confiscating smuggled goods and imposing fines are far less effective than imposing criminal penalties on smugglers, has recently proposed that the Ministry of Finance amend the regulations on penalties for smuggling. These regulations have been drafted by Shen Shikun, Deputy Commissioner of Customs of the Anti-Smuggling Section of the Customs, and will be promulgated and implemented after being legislated.</p>

The contents are as follows: (1) Those who wish to open a private cemetery shall obtain three application forms from the Health Bureau, which will be reviewed by the relevant bureaus, along with the submission of the address and building plans (the area is limited to suburban areas). Only after passing the review will a business license be granted. (2) The license shall be renewed annually, calculated from the date of issuance.

<h3>Keeping the Roads Clean: Setting Up 10,000 Trash Cans</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Health Bureau believes that the reason why the roads cannot be kept clean is not only due to the insufficient number of street sweepers, but also due to pedestrians arbitrarily discarding fruit peels and other waste. To remedy this situation, it is planned to set up wooden trash cans near the corners of roads, sidewalks, and tram and bus stops, so that pedestrians can discard the waste, beautifying the city and improving sanitation. It is currently planned that the district offices will supervise the Baojia leaders to raise funds from residents, businesses, and organizations in their respective districts to manufacture 10,000 covered wooden trash cans, two feet high and one foot square, which will be cleaned by street sweepers on a rotating basis. It is said that the Health Bureau is actively promoting this plan.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation - Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Mental Distraction</p>
<p>Question from Wang Yizhong: I am nineteen years old and suffer from asthma with excessive phlegm (white, transparent, cohesive, and sticky). I experience mental distraction and am easily startled with slight exertion or brisk walking. Using my brain continuously for one or two hours causes dizziness and brain swelling. I also experience slight insomnia and memory decline. I don't know what illness these symptoms indicate and how I should treat it.</p>
<p>Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi (Medical Doctor): Please immediately go to the X-ray department of any municipal hospital for an X-ray examination to diagnose whether you have pulmonary tuberculosis or chronic bronchitis. You must obtain an accurate diagnosis before you can take appropriate medication. For now, taking various multivitamin pills and injections of glucose calcium vitamin C, etc., will be beneficial for your lungs or bronchitis.</p>
<p>(2) Hemiplegic Numbness</p>
<p>Question from Sun Hong: My wife suddenly suffered from hemiplegic numbness three months into her pregnancy. After consulting a doctor, it was said to be related to the fetal Qi and that she would recover after a while. She felt slightly better after taking several doses of traditional Chinese medicine, but after three months, although the symptoms have lessened somewhat, her hands, feet, and face (all on the left side) are still slightly numb, making movement very inconvenient. Because we live in a remote rural area and lack access to good doctors, I am afraid of delaying treatment, so I am writing to inquire about this illness and what medicine she should take or how she should be treated.</p>
<p>Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi (Medical Doctor): You must check her urine for kidney disease. You must check her blood and blood pressure. If her blood pressure is not high, she can use shortwave diathermy and massage. At the same time, she can take Vitamin B, etc.</p>

<h3>Suited to Current Needs - New Edition of Customs Gold Units (CGU) Notes Issued - Very Good Market Response - No Fluctuations in Prices of General Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The market response to the new edition of Customs Gold Units (CGU) notes issued yesterday was very good. Although the price of gold initially surged in the morning, the closing price at noon returned to normal, and it weakened further in the afternoon. Other items, such as Chinese stocks and foreign currency, were also quite stable. As for general prices, except for daily necessities such as soap, candles, and matches, as well as raw materials such as butter, caustic soda, and sulfuric acid, which have been increasing in price for several days due to their original shortage, other items showed very little fluctuation. Price tags in general companies and firms also did not move. The reporter also inquired about the opinions of people in the financial sector. According to a person in charge of the Shanghai Bank, this issuance of new notes by the Central Bank is actually to meet the current urgent needs. It is inevitable that it will stimulate prices and public sentiment. The degree of stimulation will depend on whether the Central Bank's control is effective. As of today, the overall situation is quite good, and the market has not been disturbed. The future problem lies in whether the Central Bank can continue to control the situation and maintain this good condition. The amount of new notes issued should not be too large. Effective measures should be taken regarding gold prices. If a large number of new notes are issued, and everyone has several new notes in their pockets, then prices will rise invisibly and inevitably. Currently, inflation in our country is an undeniable fact, and the issuance of new notes is only a superficial manifestation of it. According to Shen Rixin, chairman of the Money Dealers Association, the issuance of large-denomination new notes is currently a very natural fact. The general public feels that there is a need for them, and it is particularly rare that the issuance has not caused price fluctuations in the beginning. It is expected that after a considerable period of time, the general public will "not be surprised" by the new edition of Customs Gold Units (CGU) notes. The two types of new notes issued this time are the same size and resemble the original five-yuan Customs Gold Units (CGU) notes. The patterns are also the same. The 250-yuan note is light brown, and the 500-yuan note is blue. They were printed by the American Banknote Company. According to the markings on the notes, the printing year is the 19th year of the Republic (1930).</p>
<h3>Gold Price Once Rose, But Was Eventually Pushed Back Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to increase its control. After rising high, it immediately fell back. In the early morning, with the issuance of large-denomination Customs Gold Units (CGU) notes already confirmed, the market immediately rose to 3.73 million with buyers. After opening, speculative buying was eager, and the price immediately rose, once reaching 3.79 million to 3.81 million. The Central Bank frequently increased pressure, and some stockpiles were also liquidated, gradually falling back. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 140 bars at a price of 3.71 million, and after entering the market, it broke below the 3.7 million level, exchanging at a low price of 3.69 million. At noon, it stood at around 3.72 million. In the afternoon, the forward delivery was again hyped up to 3.79 million. The Central Bank supplied another thousand-plus bars, and the price finally fell back below 3.7 million, falling 10,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry was listed slightly lower at 390,000 yuan. Silver dollars also fell slightly. Private lending rates were slightly tight, and the interest rate was slightly above 15%. Foreign currency was not exciting yesterday. The black market for US dollars initially opened at 6,500 to 6,600 in the morning, but retreated to around 6,400 at noon. In the afternoon, although the price of gold was high, the currency market still struggled to rally and made no progress. The result was a decrease of 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were still unremarkable, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was still traded between 1,220 yuan and 1,230 yuan. Indian exchange rate was 1,480 yuan to 1,500 yuan, and the British exchange rate had offers at 19,700 yuan.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Inactive</h3>
<p>Public bonds remained inactive yesterday. Unified C bond opened in the morning at 2,200 yuan, with 552 office having buy orders, rising to 2,250 yuan. The 503 office sold, falling to 2,020 yuan. Finally, it hovered between 2,050 yuan and 2,100 yuan. As a result, it was 50 yuan more each for A, B, and E certificates compared to the previous day's close, while D was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Allocation Meeting to Be Held Today - Cotton Mill Stockpiles Already Reported</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Import Control Committee has scheduled its second meeting for 10:00 AM today at the Central Bank at 15 The Bund. The committee's chairman, Li Gan, members Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, and Liu Wenteng, director of the Textile Control Committee's business department, will all attend.

<h3>Six Commercial Banks Temporarily Accepting Tax Payments - Convenient for Citizens to Pay Taxes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bank acts as the city's treasury, collecting various taxes, fees, and other payments. It has already set up 32 collection branches in various districts of the city, specializing in handling collection and transfer matters. Now that the city's business tax, house tax, and municipal construction tax have been opened for collection, it is heard that in order to facilitate the payment of taxes by citizens, in addition to the head office on Jiujiang Road and the original collection branches continuing to collect and transfer payments, all of the bank's first office at 247 Yu Garden Road, the second office at 1450 Zhonghua Road in Laoximen, and the third office at 509 Zhongzheng East Road (west of the Great World) also accept payments. At the same time, the bank believes that the urban area is vast and there are many taxpayers, and it is still worried that taxpayers may still feel crowded, have to wait for a long time, and have to travel far. Therefore, starting this year, it has temporarily entrusted the head office of Zhejiang Industrial Bank (230 Jiangxi Road), the Dongmen Road branch of Zhejiang Industrial Bank (61-63 Dongmen Road), the sixth office of Xinhua Bank (451 Zhongzheng Middle Road), the Nanjing Road branch of Siming Bank (470 Nanjing East Road), the Caojiadu branch of China Industrial Bank (451 Kangding Road), the Four Banks Savings Association (170 Nanjing West Road), and the Yangshupu office of China General Chamber of Commerce Bank (Fish Market) to collect payments separately.</p>
<h3>Autumn Silk May Be Purchased Before the Lunar New Year - Ge Jingzhong Also in Contact with Jin</h3>

It is heard that there should be no problem with the two departments approving the purchase. Moreover, the government may make a purchase before the Lunar New Year.

<h3>Industry Insiders Talk About the Reasons for Soaring Egg Prices - Increased Demand as the Lunar New Year Approaches - Lack of Funds Makes Turnover Difficult</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Because the price of eggs has soared nearly doubled in the past two weeks, reporters inquired with industry insiders to find out the truth. It is learned that the main reason for the recent egg price fluctuations is that supply cannot meet demand. The main sources of chicken and duck eggs in this city are Hankou, Wuhu, Nanjing, northern Jiangsu, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. From late November to early December last year, egg vendors purchased large quantities of goods from various places, resulting in oversupply. Most egg vendors are small-scale organizations with limited funds. Moreover, the longest preservation period for fresh eggs is only three weeks. Therefore, they all sold at reduced prices, resulting in significant losses. As a result, egg vendors have recently reduced their purchases from various places. And farmers in the production areas, because there are few people buying goods, also mostly consume the eggs they produce themselves. As a result, there are fewer goods available for purchase in the production areas, and prices have increased. On the other hand, in this city, as the Lunar New Year approaches, demand has increased sharply, while supply has decreased daily. The egg vendors' inventory is thin, resulting in soaring egg prices. It is learned that before the war, egg prices were stable because there were large-scale egg factories that mediated surpluses and shortages. Large-scale egg factories had strong capital, sufficient inventory, and refrigeration equipment. When egg vendors faced insufficient supply or disrupted sources, they found ways to supply the market. Now, because there are no large-scale egg factories to regulate the market, and general egg vendors are limited by capital, a deformed situation has arisen where a shortage means a complete shortage for everyone, and a surplus means a complete surplus for everyone. It is hoped that the relevant authorities can pay attention to this and find ways to improve the situation.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Industry and Commerce Loan Application - Central Government Has Not Yet Responded</h3>
<p>[Reported from Tianjin, 17th] The total amount of Tianjin's industry and commerce loan application is 80 billion yuan. No response has been received from the central government to date.

The price for Dianhua white sugar was 150,000 yuan to 145,000 yuan, Xing red 145,000 yuan, secondary 140,000 yuan, and Wenzhouqing 91,000 yuan to 88,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Numbers Apply for Yarn Allocation - Textile Construction Company Fully Allocates</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company opened yarn allocation as usual yesterday.

<h3>Lack of Supply and Empty Inventory - The Dye Industry Feels Depressed - Called "Making a Fortune," But Actually "Superficial Prosperity"</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The dye industry in this city performed very well last year, and it is generally regarded as "making a fortune." The reporter visited the person in charge of the Dye Industry Association yesterday. According to him, although the dye industry in this city appears to be making a fortune on the surface, it actually feels quite depressed. The reason for the depression is the lack of supply and empty inventory. Almost all of the dyes sold last year were goods obtained from the liquidation office of Defu Foreign Company, and the sales profit was only about 20%. General dye shops felt that the profit was too low and often hoarded dyes, waiting for prices to rise. However, merchants with smaller capital experienced tight funds and were forced to close down due to high-interest loans. Therefore, whether you are making a fortune or not depends on the amount of capital and inventory you have, and it cannot be generalized. Because dye industry merchants felt that dyes are necessary for various industries, they jointly requested the Import and Export Committee, along with the import and export industry, to include dyes in the list of unlimited imports. However, it has not been approved to date. And the amount of dyes previously ordered from the United States is extremely small. The industry has tried to purchase British dyes from Hong Kong, but it has obtained very little due to supply falling far short of demand. Therefore, the dye industry in this city currently has a "superficial prosperity." This is because the industry's goods are all supplied by foreign countries. Currently, not only is import restricted, but the dye industries in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States have also not recovered. Therefore, this "superficial prosperity" is deeply worrying.</p>
<h3>Many Try To Sell Stocks Quickly To Get Funds - Chinese Stocks Fell More Than They Rose</h3>

<h3>Sending Off the Inter-Port Football Delegation</h3>
<p>The city's delegation to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Inter-Port Football Tournament will depart tomorrow. In addition to holding high hopes for the delegation and believing that the delegation will do its best to win the championship, we also want to offer two points as a farewell message.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the inter-port competition is not the gain or loss of the championship, but the use of sports competitions by two different places to observe techniques and connect friendships. Therefore, when we participate in the inter-port competition, we hope not only to achieve a fair victory, but also to achieve the ultimate goal. This hope is placed in noble spirit and technical performance. The outcome of the competition has good fortune and misfortune. If our spirit and technical performance are very good, even if we unfortunately lose, it is still glorious. Otherwise, even if we are fortunate to win, the words engraved on the silver cup cannot match the impression engraved in the minds of thousands of spectators. This bad impression will have to wait until the second inter-port competition is held in Hong Kong, with a good performance to regain it.</p>
<p>The inter-port competition is a preparation and foundation for greater integration. Although there are many foreigners participating in the inter-port delegation, Chinese people account for the majority. The technical level of football is the highest in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The representatives we participate in the World Games will occupy most of the places in Shanghai and Hong Kong. We must look ahead and see the future responsibilities and obligations, the responsibilities and obligations of working together to win glory for the country. Although today we are on opposing sides on the court, we will still be comrades on the same front in the future, so we must love each other and get closer to prepare for future cooperation. We hope that Chinese players from Shanghai and Hong Kong can have a pleasant gathering after the game, and everyone can frankly and sincerely study techniques and enhance friendship in a loving way to establish a good foundation.</p>
<p>Respectfully wish the inter-port football delegation a safe journey and a triumphant return. (Wei)</p>

<h3>Full Operation of the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>— Jinan, 10th Dispatch from Our Correspondent Li Tian</p>
<p>First Major Station and Bridge Eastward</p>
<p>Perhaps because most of the stations along the Jiaoji Railway were destroyed by the Communist army, the Jinan Railway Station, which was "spared from disaster," has become one of the most beautiful stations in the country in the reporter's direct observation and memory. Although the station building's design is not grand or magnificent, it is of different forms, spacious and appropriate, and has the artistic flavor of the Middle Ages. The three foreign buildings arranged on the north side of Jinan's most prosperous commercial district, one of which includes a five-story clock tower soaring into the clouds, are truly full of infinite artistic and poetic charm when viewed from afar.</p>
<p>The reporter braved the cold wind and stepped into this beautiful station at dawn on the 6th. The passengers at the station were lined up in three long rows of more than ten feet each, buying tickets in order at three different windows. Although there were many travelers, there was no disorder or rush. The few military police officers on the station lazily wandered around, showing a listless expression. The initial impression of this situation, which was far better than the order at stations in places such as Beijing and Shanghai, surprised the reporter. However, after witnessing the orderly progress of each station, not only when buying tickets and boarding the train but also when alighting and exiting the station, the reporter realized the importance of social education. In order to facilitate the inspection of travelers and their identification, the public has naturally developed this good habit.</p>
<h3>The Jiaoji Line, Less Affected by Internal Strife, is Relatively Complete</h3>
<p>Originally, the construction of the Jiaoji Line originated from the fact that in the 23rd year of Guangxu [1897], Germany used the pretext of the murder of two German missionaries in Shandong to send troops to occupy Jiaozhou Bay and demanded the construction of a railway from Jiaozhou to Jinan Prefecture and from Jinan to the Shandong border. Construction began in August of the 25th year of Guangxu [1899] and was completed in June of the 30th year of Guangxu [1904] for the Jiaoji Line and the Zhangdian-Boshan branch line. Because this line was built by Germany, sovereignty was always in the hands of the Germans. In the third year of the Republic [1914], when the First European War broke out, Japan took advantage of its participation in the war to invade and occupy it in November. It was not until three years after the end of the European War (the 11th year of the Republic [1922]) in November, after several negotiations and compromises, that we took over. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], when the War of Resistance against Japan began, Han Fuqu retreated without a fight, and it fell into enemy hands again in December of the same year. It was not until September of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], when the Japanese army surrendered and the Second World War ended in victory, that we officially took it back from the enemy on October 29 of the same year.</p>
<p>In the past, although the Jiaoji Line had suffered from foreign aggression, it was less affected by internal strife, so it was considered one of the most complete lines compared to other lines in the country. Since we took over the Jiaoji Railway from the Japanese on October 29 of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], the Jiaoji Railway has experienced the most tragic fate in its history in the Communist army's relentless destruction and attacks. Although the Railway Bureau repaired it as it was damaged, the destruction continued to expand, and it became impossible to repair it. It was not until June of last year that Commander Wang Zuomin led the elite forces to personally command and opened up the entire line on October 10. Director Chen Shungeng followed up with a spirit of combat. He directed the emergency repairs and finally connected the rails on December 12. The entire line officially opened to traffic on the 16th, and on January 6 of this year, a special express train arriving on the same day between Ji and Ji was added.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Railway Bureau, the total length of the Jiaoji Railway's trunk and branch lines is 461 kilometers. However, in the 409 days from the government's takeover to December 12 of last year, the total was:</p>
<p>(1) Tracks: Damaged by the Communist army 949 times (an average of nearly five times every two days). If calculated by distance, the total was 394.285 kilometers, accounting for six-fifths of the total length of the line.</p>
<p>(2) Steel rails: Lost 41,377 pieces; 319,873 sleepers; 94,068 fishplates; 176,400 bolts; 1,269,099 spikes.</p>
<p>(3) Bridges: Destroyed 303 times, totaling 230 bridges.</p>
<p>(4) Station buildings: Destroyed 92 times, totaling 44 stations, totaling 55,290 square meters.</p>
<p>(5) Water supply equipment: Destroyed 14 times, totaling 14 locations.</p>
<p>(6) Signals: Destroyed 68 times.</p>
<p>(7) Wiring equipment: Destroyed 301 times, totaling 8,364 poles and 8,313,597 meters of wire.</p>
<p>(8) Vehicles: Destroyed 204 vehicles.</p>
<p>(9) A total of 279,9427 man-days were spent on repairs, almost equal to the labor and materials required to rebuild a new road. Is this number not large enough? The Communist army's endless sabotage of national vitality and the destruction of life really makes one wonder what their intentions are.</p>
<h3>Completing the Miracle of Opening to Traffic in a Paralyzed State</h3>
<p>The reporter took an ordinary express train from Jinan to Fangzi. The so-called ordinary express train actually stops at every station. The train left the station at 8:15 AM. Except for the third-class carriages, where there were a few people standing without seats, there was no ordinary express train on the Beijing-Shanghai line where passengers were squeezed as if they were escaping. However, this line is not without its shortcomings. The slowness of the train and the severe turbulence reminded me of the situation when the "wartime Xiang-Gui Railway had just opened to traffic." A passenger in the same carriage smiled and said to me: "It's much better now. It can travel more than 20 kilometers per hour! It used to be like a bullock cart!" Another said: "There was a period when it was simply a cradle, and the movement of the car made us dizzy." The reporter had never taken it before, so I couldn't compare, but even based on the current situation, it is not difficult to imagine the severity of the Communist army's destruction and the hardship of the Railway Bureau's emergency repairs!</p>
<p>The Jiaoji Railway was originally the only steel-sleeper railway in the country besides the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. However, the steel sleepers under the tracks were stolen by the enemy before the victory. After the victory, due to the continuous destruction by the Communist army and the difficulty in replenishing materials, the surplus materials from other railway lines were mostly allocated. As a result, German, British, Japanese, 30 kg, 37 kg, 41, 42, and 43 kg steel rails were all available, and there were dozens of types, simply becoming a steel rail exhibition. The weight and height of the steel rails are inconsistent, and the fishplates that fasten the steel rails are all made of earth. Since the abnormal fishplates cannot be used, some are even replaced with wood. In addition, the No. 10 switches were originally used before each regular station, but now No. 8 switches are used due to the shortage of No. 10 switches. Under these layers of difficult conditions, it is truly a miracle that the Jiaoji Line can resume traffic from a paralyzed state.</p>
<h3>The Iron Bridge was Blasted and Tilted, and the Scars were unbearable to Behold</h3>
<p>From Jinan through Licheng, Guodian, Longshan to Zaoyuansi, all the houses are generally repaired and intact. From Zaoyuansi onwards (except Zhangdian), all that can be seen is a yellow sand, with few trees and few people. All the houses have been almost completely destroyed, with broken walls and ruins everywhere. The road protection trenches on both sides of the track meander eastward along the track, endlessly. The telephone poles on the side of the road are all made of various types of tree trunks that are both thin, short, and bent, and piles of shattered porcelain insulators of the telephone poles still occasionally emit a chaotic flash in the sunlight. Most of the iron bridges were blasted and tilted, and the scars were mottled, making it unbearable to look at. An average of one shelter every few dozen steps must be on the side of the road, and a solid bunker must be every one kilometer (with one at each end of each bridge). Around the bunkers, or attached three or four small fortresses, outside the small fortresses, and there is a deep trench of more than a foot, the trenches are full of wooden thorns, the outside of the trenches is surrounded by branches or wire nets, so there are three layers, and the graves along the road are countless, and many of the soil colors are still fresh. The withered trees and cold crows, the broken tombstones and the residual steles, made the reporter feel as if he were on the northern border and rereading an "Elegy on an Ancient Battlefield."</p>
<p>At 9:25 AM, the car arrived at Zhangdian, which is the first major station since the Jinan car ride. The 40-kilometer Zibo branch line meets here. It is not only the distribution port of Zibo coal, but also a famous domestic light metal production base because the area is rich in aluminum. During the enemy and puppet occupation, a light metal development company was established here, with a large scale and a maximum of more than 40,000 workers. Before the end of the war, the enemy planned to establish an aircraft manufacturing plant here, but it was suspended due to the surrender. After the victory, the factory was taken over by the National Resources Commission, but until now, it is said that the machines are still in a sleeping state and are rusting.</p>
<h3>The First Bridge has Ten Holes, Six of which were Destroyed by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>The three stations east of Zhangdian are Xindian. Between Xindian and Zihedian is the Zihe Bridge, the largest bridge on the entire line. The bridge is 350 meters long and has ten holes. Because it was destroyed by the Communist army, six of them have been destroyed. The Railway Bureau used 6,000 sleepers stacked in a well shape to replace the bridge piers, greatly reducing the load. When the car crawled over at the slowest speed, the creaking sound of the bridge piers being pressed could still be heard. There were hot springs nearby. According to the engineering staff of the Railway Bureau, the spring water was very abundant before the war, but it had been cut off for eight years during the War of Resistance. It was not until our emergency repair personnel came to repair the bridge that the spring water suddenly flowed out again, and the spring flow was much stronger than in the past. The villagers were surprised by this, so they all said that God bless China, and the hot springs were resurrected. The Railway Bureau is planning to build a large-scale hot spring hotel and bathroom after the war calms down for passengers to go to Gao Mu.</p>
<p>At 4:20 PM, the car arrived in Weixian, the largest station in the central part of the Jiaoji Line. The final station of the car today was originally Fangzi, more than 20 kilometers away from here (for safety reasons, the Jiaoji Line has not yet opened night cars), but because the express train heading east tomorrow will still start from Weixian, we decided to take advantage of this opportunity to visit Commander-in-Chief Xia Chuzhong, who is stationed here, and then continue eastward tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>In the Sound of the Express Train Returning Home, Seeing the Economy of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 12th Dispatch from Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>The Spring Festival is coming, and this major artery in Jiangnan—the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line—must once again fulfill its responsibility of carrying travelers returning home. Every train departing from Shanghai is always crowded, while every train departing from Hangzhou seems much more deserted. In order to facilitate the return home, the Railway Bureau has specially added a "return home special train," which departs from Shanghai North Station at 10:00 PM and arrives at the city station at 3:00 AM. The travelers are really struggling, but they can't stop the thoughts of the travelers returning home, and the trains carry the travelers back to Zhejiang one by one.</p>
<p>Is it still "the local accent has not changed, but the temples have turned white"? Many people struggling outside their hometowns have temples that have turned white, but the local accent has also changed. Most of us travelers can be said to have grown up in rural society, but today's rural areas have reached an unbearable state. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the author took a stroll through the towns and villages along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line and deeply felt that if the farmers' associations do not take practical measures, then the foundation of China's nation will be blown away.</p>
<p>Two Jin of Meat Cannot be Exchanged for a Dou of Rice</p>
<p>In the rural areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, there is a saying that "a dou of rice for three jin of meat," which means that farmers can exchange one dou of rice for three jin of pork in the city. Now, the price of rice on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line is roughly 45,000 to 46,000 yuan per dan to more than 50,000 yuan per dan, while pork costs 3,600 yuan to 3,800 yuan per jin. Then, at a price of 4,600 to 5,000 yuan per dou of rice, it cannot even be exchanged for two jin of meat. The ratio is too far apart. Moreover, the cultivation and planting of one mu of land is painstaking. On average, each mu can harvest about one stone and six or seven dou, and the labor cost is roughly 2,000 yuan per worker for food and lodging. The capital must be about eight dou of rice, then the capital has already taken up half of the harvest.</p>
<p>Most of the villagers are poor and few are rich. Most of the rich villagers have become landlords who enjoy the benefits. These thousands of poor villagers have no way to invest in the land. So, they borrow money from the wealthy households. Between spring and summer last year, borrowing one stone of rice required paying back one stone and five dou, or even two stones. In addition to repaying debts and capital, farmers need to bear the grain and taxes assigned by the landlords. What is left, I don't know how many jin of meat can be bought? "A dou of rice for three jin of meat" has become a fantasy. Being able to exchange it for one jin of meat is already a joy.</p>
<p>In recent years, it is not enough for the villagers to make a living, so where do they have the extra money to restore their homes? So, the farmhouses are dilapidated, the farm tools are also damaged, and they don't even think about adding new and good clothes.</p>
<p>Agricultural Loans Should Repel High-Interest Loans</p>
<p>Although the government is promoting "two-five" rent reduction, "rent" is "rent," and "debt" is still "debt." The burden of "debt" can crush people to death. High-interest loans are rampant in the rural areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. It dries up the little water left in the rural areas, and it plunders the little financial activity left in the rural areas. Tens of millions of agricultural loans sound good and loud, but the villagers are eagerly hoping that the people who release agricultural loans can move their noble steps, go to the farmhouses in the rural areas more often, don't dislike them for being dirty, and ask them about the actual situation. How much practical benefit have they received from the loans? Has the power of agricultural loans reduced the poisonous flames of high-interest loans? Or has the power of high-interest loans surpassed agricultural loans? I heard the villagers say, "Is agricultural loan just a festering sore?" Some people also said, "The procedures are too troublesome." I think the people who organize agricultural loans should not just be done after lending the money. It's not that they don't care about being thorough after lending the money. But it is necessary to ensure that every penny, the villagers get the benefit of every penny. Every dime, the villagers get the practical benefit of every dime. Only then can the organizers of agricultural loans fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Rural Festivals Have Turned into Deserted Months</p>
<p>The cities along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line are, in fact, thriving because of the rural areas. The wealthy residents in the cities have at least a few mu of land and live a leisurely life by renting out rice. The shops in the cities sell luxury consumer goods to the wealthy residents and ordinary consumer goods to the villagers. During the so-called "rural festival" period, each store is three times more profitable, and its "rural festival" period is always after the autumn harvest. Summer is the busy farming season, and it is a deserted month. If you don't believe it, you can go to the cities along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line to investigate, and you will know that in late summer and early autumn, each store hoards a large amount of goods to sell in late autumn and winter. When winter comes, the villagers have to prepare for the New Year, slaughter pigs and chickens, pickle fish and bacon, and purchase New Year's goods to express respect for the blessings of the Bodhisattva and the ancestors, and finally eat and drink a lot by themselves. The rural areas are too depressed this year, and the rent rice and debts are almost impossible to pay back. How can there be money to celebrate the New Year in a big way? Due to the depression in the rural areas, an unprecedented commercial depression has formed. The originally lively "rural festival" has turned into a deserted day.</p>
<p>Predicting the Prosperity of Beidajie Will Collapse</p>
<p>From this major artery of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, there are three relatively large cities: Jiaxing, Songjiang, and Xiashi. These three cities are all in distress. Many stores are about to collapse. There is an old store in Jiaxing with more than 70 years of history, which was founded in the Tongzhi period and is called Shuntai Livestock and Porcelain Sesame Store. The scale is quite large, but it closed down before the Spring Festival. In Xiashi, Yuji Oil Store, which has always been a pioneer in the oil industry, Yongfeng Pharmaceutical Store, and Yongmaoxing Flour Store have all closed down one after another. Songjiang is no exception, and several stores have also closed down. Studying the reasons for their closure, it is nothing more than too high loan interest rates, slow sales, huge expenses, and the price of goods sold is not worth the price of goods purchased. At the same time, in places like Jiaxing, each store decorates its storefront, which costs a lot. The original intention was to show off their skills in the winter after decorating the storefront, but they didn't know that the winter was unbearably deserted, and there was no way to pay for the decoration fees. The closure of the Shuntai surname in Jiaxing this time is valued at more than 200 million yuan. When the reporter wrote this manuscript, according to reliable information, Jiuhe, a very large silk and cloth store in Jiaxing, has also closed down, valued at more than 130 million yuan. There are many other closures. Some people predict that around the Spring Festival, Beidajie, which was originally familiar, will become desolate and deserted, and there will be many shops vacant on Beidajie, which was originally difficult to find a branch. The depression and desolation of the cities along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line indirectly indicates the poverty of the villagers. They can't afford to buy things, which affects the stores, and they have no choice but to close down. Return home, return home, may the travelers see their own homes and think about why their homes have become so desolate. The travelers are nostalgic, how can they revive their hometowns?</p>
<h3>Vietnam: In Bitter Struggle From South to North</h3>
<p>— January 1st Air Dispatch, Jié Sūn from Hanoi</p>
<p>The day before France received the four prefectures of Battambang, Pibul Khamsongkhram, Champasak, and Lan Xang on the Siam-Vietnam border, I, the reporter, arrived in Battambang. This capital, the most prosperous of the four, has experienced shop closures and mass emigration since its fate was decided to return to French rule, suddenly transforming from bustling to desolate.</p>
<p>Tall buildings were torched by Khmer revolutionaries, and bridges and railways were also destroyed. As French troops advanced into the prefectures, they suffered heavy casualties from revolutionary ambushes. In Battambang, on the day of the reception ceremony, the French had originally planned to make a grand display to show "welcome" and "celebration," but the residents either relocated or remained indoors. As a result, only a few hired poor people waved flags and shouted slogans on the streets, serving as a mere embellishment to the reception ceremony.</p>
<p>Reaching the bank of a Mekong River tributary, as we were preparing to cross by raft, French planes suddenly circled overhead. We quickly scattered and lay prone, but ultimately two people, a man and a woman, died in the machine-gun fire. After the French planes left, I looked at the dead and couldn't help but shed tears of sorrow. However, the Vietnamese youth accompanying me simply looked, gritted their teeth, clenched their fists, and walked forward without looking back. What a moving scene!</p>
<p>We arrived in Thái Bình after half a day. This is a town where both French and Vietnamese troops are stationed. Beyond this, the highway is still in good condition. I traveled by Việt Minh army vehicle to Nam Định. Nam Định, also a provincial capital, is a central point on the transportation line between Hanoi and Haiphong, holding an important position. Half of it faces the river, offering beautiful scenery. The magnificent buildings are second only to Hanoi and Hue in northern Vietnam. The scale of a textile factory there can be said to be the largest in Vietnam. There are over two thousand overseas Chinese in Nam Định. Amid the extremely dangerous situation between the French and Vietnamese, everyone feels insecure and unable to live peacefully. Seeing that I was escorted by Việt Minh troops and not interfered with by French soldiers, they assumed I was a high-ranking official sent by the Chinese government. They gathered to inquire what policies the motherland's government was adopting towards overseas Chinese in Vietnam. I couldn't answer, and tears welled up in my eyes. When friends who knew me saw me, they spoke of the future plight of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, even bursting into tears. The motherland has let down the overseas Chinese too much!</p>
<p>Việt Minh Army: Practicing Independent Struggle</p>
<p>Việt Minh troops have always been stationed in the center of Nam Định, while French troops are stationed on the outskirts. The Nam Định branch of the Banque de l'Indochine is jointly guarded by French and Vietnamese troops. On the second day of my arrival in Nam Định, French soldiers guarding the bank suddenly attacked the Vietnamese soldiers, triggering a large-scale conflict. Gunfire was incessant, shells flew everywhere, and an unknown number of citizens were killed and wounded. Amidst the chaos, at the urging of the Việt Minh side, I retreated from the city to the Việt Minh army headquarters in the nearby suburbs.</p>
<p>The commander, a middle-aged man, had lived in China for many years and spoke fluent Mandarin and Cantonese. I asked about the source and supply of the Việt Minh army's equipment. He said, "We rely entirely on our own struggle. You could say we are fighting an isolated battle. No one has ever provided us with supplies, nor do we expect anyone to provide us with any at this time. What we have is a heart full of enthusiasm. We and our parents have already been slaves, and we cannot let our descendants be slaves again."</p>
<p>I also asked about the Việt Minh's attitude towards maintaining the safety of overseas Chinese. He angrily read out the Việt Minh's statement to overseas Chinese: "…We deeply understand that an independent China is a guarantee of peace in Asia and tranquility in Vietnam. The friendship between China and Vietnam is a natural result between the two nations. You must know that the Vietnamese are your only protectors of your interests in Vietnam, and the necessary and sufficient guarantee of these interests is the independence and freedom of Vietnam." Finally, he emphasized, "We have already ordered our troops to earnestly protect overseas Chinese. At the same time, we also hope that Chinese friends will not be misled by the French side's divisive and provocative schemes."</p>
<p>Việt Minh soldiers, regardless of rank, receive a monthly salary of only six Vietnamese đồng. Coarse rice and simple dishes are the same for officers and soldiers alike. They are very concerned about China's attitude towards Vietnam, often asking me to talk about the current situation in China, with their commander acting as the translator. I stayed at the headquarters for five days, receiving courteous and preferential treatment. When I left Nam Định via Hanoi, several officers and soldiers were dispatched to escort me.</p>
<p>French and Vietnamese Sides: Conducting Emergency Preparations</p>
<p>All the iron bridges on the railway line were destroyed by Allied planes during the war. After Japan's surrender, they were hastily repaired, barely allowing traffic. Now, they have been destroyed again by the Việt Minh. Only parts of the highway are still passable. Residents along the way are stepping up evacuation and reinforcing defenses. French planes also frequently fly over to bomb and attack.</p>
<p>Since the conflicts in Haiphong and other places, both the French and Vietnamese sides in Hanoi have been on emergency alert. The streets are desolate, shops are closed, and war bunkers are everywhere. Government buildings and other important structures are fortified with sandbags and barbed wire. French and Vietnamese soldiers and civilians throw grenades and shoot at each other. The situation is terrifying, a complete mess.</p>
<p>During this period, French Commissioner for Northern Vietnam Sainteny attempted to mediate between the French and Vietnamese sides. However, as the Việt Minh newspapers said, "Due to the reactionary colonialists' firm will to conquer, it did not show any success." There was also a period when both the French and Vietnamese sides were watching the outcome of the French government's presidential election. The Việt Minh newspaper "National Daily" stated, "Regardless of whether the right-wing faction remains in power or the left-wing faction gains power, the Vietnamese nation will always maintain its original stance. The Vietnamese people are always prepared to welcome and support French people who support Vietnamese national independence and unity, and are even more prepared to forcefully resist conquest conspiracies and encroachment that infringe upon sovereignty." The "National Newspaper" also stated, "If Indochinese affairs are still entrusted to the High Commissioner (i.e., General D'Argenlieu), then war between France and Vietnam will be inevitable."</p>
<p>After the French government clearly expressed its attitude towards Vietnam, the "National Salvation Daily" said, "From now on, we are always prepared for long-term resistance, and we must be prepared to enter a more resolute stage. We should not ask when the war will end or when tranquility will come. We should only enter a stage of long-term combat from now on, and this war must end only when the reactionary elements of French colonialism fail in their conquest actions."</p>
<p>French Planes Mobilized, Ho Chi Minh Escapes</p>
<p>By December 17th, the situation became even more dangerous, and a large-scale war finally broke out. French planes mobilized to assist in the battle. The sound of artillery, machine guns, and bombs was deafening. Both sides, as well as Chinese and Vietnamese people, suffered heavy casualties, with corpses strewn on the streets. The Việt Minh Prime Minister's Office and Ho Chi Minh's residence were finally captured by French soldiers after fierce street fighting. According to the Việt Minh secret radio broadcast, Ho Chi Minh narrowly escaped, while Ngo Duy Diem was seriously injured.</p>
<p>It has been almost half a month since then. The French side claims to be conducting mopping-up operations, while the Việt Minh is firmly resisting in the city center. The Chinese Consul-General in Saigon, Ai Zijing, proposed the establishment of a neutral zone in the Chinese quarter, and the French military commander in Northern Vietnam, Molière, expressed agreement. However, this so-called neutral zone is not being respected. The losses to the lives and property of overseas Chinese are impossible to calculate. The most tragic thing is that two young Chinese girls, both under the age of twenty, were captured and raped by French soldiers, barely alive, and then stabbed to death with bayonets in their lower bodies, making it unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are like orphans without recourse. Before the war, they were at the mercy of others, and after the war, they are still treated like beasts of burden, slaughtered at will. The Nanjing massacre, the Dutch East Indies massacre, the Vietnam massacre, are still happening every day. The motherland has let them down too much!</p>
<p>French military and political officials in Vietnam, including Colonial Minister Moutet, Far East Army Commander Valluy, and High Commissioner for Vietnam D'Argenlieu, frequently travel between Saigon and Hanoi to hold meetings or command military operations. Moutet said, "After so many violent incidents in Vietnam, it is of course impossible to reach an agreement with the Vietnamese party." D'Argenlieu said, "In the current stage of the Vietnamese people's development, France does not want to grant them unconditional independence." The French government has also officially announced its determination to deal with Vietnam by force. French soldiers are being transferred east in a steady stream. French Prime Minister Léon Blum, a socialist who often expresses humanitarian views, has also endorsed the use of force against Vietnamese nationalists. Therefore, the war has spread almost throughout Vietnam. In the days to come, the bloody struggle in Vietnam will inevitably become more tragic!</p>
<h3>Parisian Cultural and Educational Festival: A Good Finale, Sino-Foreign Cultural Cooperation as the Main Theme</h3>
<p>— Paris 6th Air Dispatch, Special Correspondent Hong Fu</p>
<p>"Gatherings are frequent, banquets are numerous," this beautiful line from Du Fu's Southern Suburban Rhapsody can be borrowed to describe Paris after the end of World War II, where grand gatherings are frequent. Today, there are two prominent figures named Xiao in the center of the Chinese intellectual community in France, sharing the same meaning of "banquets" and complementing and relating to each other. The immortal masterpiece of Old Du coincides unexpectedly. Both Xiaos are from Hunan Province, one is Mr. Xiao Shijun, the chief writer of the Kuomintang's typical publication, "Three Principles Guidance," and the other is Mr. Xiao Zisheng (Yu), the former Minister of Agriculture and Mines, the current chairman of the Sino-French Association, and the vice president of the Paris Advanced Chinese Academy. Male and female talents from Chinese universities, in a world of complex situations, cannot possess the skills of ancient philosophers in cultivating their character through calligraphy. Among the students studying abroad, there are many who are good at painting, but those who excel in running, cursive, and regular script are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. It is not easy to find even one in a hundred people, and it is even difficult to find them in various European and American countries. These two Xiaos are both proficient in Chinese studies and are also good at large Roman characters. Paris is a gathering place for talents from all over the world. This alone is enough to describe the rest. It is not easy to have such a wonderful encounter in the famous cities of the United States. Mr. Xiao Zisheng is a leading figure in overseas Sino-Western cultural cooperation. His wife is the daughter of Ling, the former Minister of Finance. She studied education in the United States, and after graduating and returning to China, she married Mr. Xiao. They became husband and wife through friendship, and after their marriage, they traveled to France together. Ling, the Minister of Finance's paintings, more than ten years ago, were once recorded in the world-renowned Paris "Illustration" with three-color printing, showing a rare and vigorous beauty just like himself, naturally forming his own style in Chinese painting. What Mrs. Xiao Ling has been working on in recent years is Western painting, and her figures and flower paintings are all exquisite. Fragrant orchids fill the room, and elegant writings spread their fragrance. The four walls are adorned with treasures, worthy of being combined with Mr. Xiao's cursive five-character couplet to adorn Mrs. Ling, shining with comparable beauty. The couplet reads, "The quiet person has many wonderful thoughts, and the transcendent person's thoughts are not ordinary." The demeanor and spirit of Mrs. Xiao Ling Xiaoyin (Zhuo) can be vividly described by these two sentences. In the past, Zhou Yu was the happy son-in-law of the Qiao family, and this has been passed down as a beautiful story for thousands of years. In comparison, this Xiao Lang is almost inferior. June 8th is the anniversary of the marriage of the two. The two are also leaders in Parisian social circles, with three thousand guests following them. Recently, Mr. Xiao, as an expert, attended the unprecedented United Nations Scientific and Cultural Conference, representing our country, advocating and campaigning. In mid-December, during the grand ceremony held by the University of Paris to commemorate the "Four Great Sinologists Who Passed Away During the European War," he followed Ambassador Qian Jiping, expressing his feelings through others, earnestly delivering a speech, and showing the virtue of the ancient civilized country of the East in treating respected elders with courtesy. Among the so-called four great Sinologists, only Louis Laloy focused on music in his studies. The rest, such as Paul Pelliot, Henri Maspero, and Marcel Granet, either excelled in Egyptian archaeology or were known for their Chinese studies in various countries, all contributing to the mutual assistance of international intellectuals. At the closing banquet of the Scientific Language Education Conference, the Xiao Ling couple hosted a gathering of all the sages (see attached picture of the signature ceremony of representatives and art scholars), soothing the fatigue of all the representatives who had been dedicated to their duties day and night, and even more so a good finale to the Cultural and Educational Festival. The banquet was arranged in a T-shape, with dozens of attendees. The host, Mr. Xiao, sat at the bottom of the T, holding six swallowtails straight, while the hostess, Mrs. Xiao Ling, sat at the center of the painting, at the head of the swallow. On both sides of Mrs. Xiao's seat were numerous talented people, all representatives of the conference in evening gowns. On the right side of Mr. Xiao's seat, the female painter Chen Yuan represented Mrs. Xiao, occupying the first seat, while the reporter and Ms. Zhou jointly occupied the end of the swallow's wing where the T is written to the right. There were four cold dishes: (1) gizzards and livers, (2) dried bean curd shreds, (3) celery shreds, and (4) roasted meat. It was agreed to have four hot dishes: (1) braised fish, (2) fried meat, (3) stir-fried tofu with salt and peppercorns, and (4) stir-fried cabbage with tofu. Finally, each person received a small bowl of seaweed, meat slice, and dried shrimp soup, brilliant and then entering a cool state, with an indescribable sense of surprise. Mr. Li Shizeng's theory of using soybeans to enrich the country, practiced overseas, showed remarkable foresight. Now, having two tofu dishes is not too much, and we should take this opportunity to declare soybeans as a national treasure. Guo Shouliang, Fang Zhong, and other sons in the neighboring seats, who are good at speaking well, competed to propose methods of toasting: (1) allowing single men and ladies to drink together, (2) people with the same surname Zhou, Wang, and Qian drinking together, (3) husbands and wives drinking together, (4) students toasting their teachers and the teachers' wives, (5) old staff members toasting the old minister, opening a new face, and dispersing in joy. The poem is recorded as follows: The paintings and calligraphy adorn the fragrant room. The spirit of fish and water shines like the sun and moon. Xiaoyin has accumulated years of artistry. Xiao Lang is as proud as the prince from another era. The flowers bloom near the river on the sixth and eighth days of the month. Three thousand guests report to the country. The mission is happy to follow the cultural and educational expansion. Ling Xiao spreads her wings over the vast ocean.</p>

<h3>Fuzhou People Worry About Rice</h3>
<p>— 8th Air Dispatch, Special Correspondent Chen Zheng Yu, this newspaper, Fuzhou</p>
<p>New Year's calendars of the Republic of China year 36 are hung on every household. The city streets are posted with slogans celebrating the New Year and the promulgation of the Constitution in red and green. Although Fuzhou citizens traditionally still attach great importance to the Lunar New Year, the New Year also gives them a new feeling and a lively atmosphere. Especially this New Year's Day, all sectors of Fuzhou were more enthusiastic than in previous years in celebrating the dual significance of the 36th anniversary of the Republic of China and the establishment of the Constitution.</p>
<p>After the New Year celebrations, everyone calmed down to welcome the New Year with good news. This good news is: Fuzhou grain prices have risen three levels, 60,000, 80,000, jumping over 90,000 yuan. The people of Fuzhou restrained their New Year's laughter, calculating with burdened shoulders how to get through the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>With the firming of grain prices, all commodity prices have also taken the opportunity to change prices. In a word: prices have created a low pressure—the common people cannot breathe.</p>
<p>Two months ago, Fuzhou rice prices hovered around 60,000 yuan per picul, and it was also the autumn harvest season. Most people estimated that grain prices could be stabilized for a while. The laboring poor and public education people all had endless hope for this. However, good times do not last long. In just a few days, grain prices have risen by more than one-third since the beginning of the New Year. Observing the current situation, grain prices still have a tendency to rise again, and the closer it gets to the end of the year, the more serious the problem becomes.</p>
<p>For this reason, the reporter paid a special visit to Fuzhou Mayor Yan Lingfeng and the person in charge of the Municipal Government Grain Regulation Office to inquire about what measures could be taken to suppress the current Fuzhou grain prices to stabilize people's livelihood. According to them, Fuzhou rice mainly relies on transportation from the rice-producing counties in northern Fujian. Secondly, it comes from sea rice from Wenzhou, Shanghai and other places. Recently, with the end of the year approaching, the import of rice from various places has been somewhat affected. Moreover, the hoarding and waiting by rice merchants and the phenomenon of consumers buying New Year's rice are all enough to stimulate fluctuations in grain prices. Therefore, the Municipal Government Grain Regulation Office has opened its ten distribution stations located in various parts of the city, distributing rice to poor households at a price one-quarter lower than the market price, thereby implementing price stabilization. In addition, it is carrying out grain registration, prohibiting exports, cracking down on hoarding and profiteering, etc. Moreover, it has recently sent personnel to Wuhu to purchase a large amount of rice. The plan is really grand, but the rice prices on the market are burning and spreading like wildfire. Remote water cannot put out a nearby fire!</p>
<p>Fuzhou has a population of nearly 400,000 people. According to official statistics, it needs more than 2,000 dan of rice per day. How much rice does Fuzhou have in stock? There is no survey or statistics. The Municipal Government's Grain Regulation Office has reportedly been throwing out hundreds of dan of rice at low prices every day in recent days to supply equalization. Not to mention the fundamental solution, even the palliative solution has very little effect. The Municipal Government does not seem to be able to come up with a fundamental solution to crack down on rice merchants who hoard and manipulate the grain market; nor does it have the necessary means—controlling a large amount of grain (according to the person in charge of the Municipal Government's Grain Regulation Office, the office often controls 40,000 to 50,000 dan of grain at most, and 10,000 dan at least).</p>
<p>The social economy of Fuzhou is already on the verge of an unprecedented crisis—for example, the Fudian Iron Factory and the Fuzhou Electric and Steam Company, which are of considerable scale, are both facing shutdowns due to lack of raw materials, stagnation in sales, and unbearable losses. The Fudian Iron Factory is the only iron factory in the southeastern half of China, and it has been able to manufacture steam engines, hydraulic engines, gasoline engines, and machine tools for the use of industries in the southeastern provinces. Today, it is also unable to support itself. This alone is enough to give a glimpse of the desolate state of Fuzhou's industry and commerce today. Disputes between labor and capital are also frequently heard. If, amidst the overall social depression, the "rice" problem cannot be solved in a concrete way, the strong will fall into the ditches, and the strong will be forced to take risks. Society will form a turbulent and restless situation. Many riots in the past started from the panic of rice and the chaos of the currency system. How can we ignore it?</p>
<p>It is heard that the Fujian representatives of the National Assembly, because the Fuzhou grain problem is becoming more and more serious, have specially jointly requested the central government to exempt the grain levied and borrowed by the central government from the province for military rations, and reserve the price adjustment for the city's grain use. This is certainly good news. However, this alone is not enough to suppress the rice prices in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>The adjustment of supply and demand, the management of grain merchants, and the control of grain by the city government are the ways to solve the grain panic in Fuzhou. The Municipal Government may as well severely punish the grain merchants who hoard and profiteer on a large scale. Fuzhou is the leading area of Fujian, and Fuzhou's municipal facilities are qualified as a political assessment standard for the province. The Provincial Government should also issue an emergency order to the counties in northern Fujian to transport rice quickly to help stabilize the people's hearts.</p>
<p>Winter is deep, and spring is not far away. The people of Fuzhou shiver in the cold winter, and they hope that spring will bring spring news to relieve them of their rice worries.</p>

<h3>Difficult to Get Through the Underworld</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>"Lunar New Year is banned every year, but the New Year is celebrated vigorously every year. The old year is difficult to get through, year after year."</p>
<p>At first glance, this poem looks like a joke, but in fact, these few words express the cause and effect, the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy of "celebrating the New Year."</p>
<p>Do you think I'm talking nonsense? Let's see, there are facts to prove it:</p>
<p>Pork has been soaring to 360,000 yuan per dan in recent days due to increased demand; in order to supply the market with a large amount of cooking oil, the municipal government is considering allocating 5,000 dan of oil from the vegetable oil factory to try to stabilize the market price; the pawnshop industry's settlement is approaching, increasing interest rates and shortening the loan period, resulting in a doubling of profits, ranking above all industries. Why is this? Everyone wants to celebrate the Lunar New Year!</p>
<p>The demand for flour allocation is extremely urgent. Each flour factory specially purchases 48,000 bags of foreign flour to adjust the demand; the Four Joint Offices' production loans recently approved 700 billion first, but applicants are still extremely crowded, so they have to work as usual on Sundays. Why is this? It's still because everyone wants to celebrate the old year.</p>
<p>Starting from the 16th, the Beijing-Shanghai line will add a special train, called the "Returning Home Special Train"; schools will start winter vacation early, called "Ending Early"; institutions and groups will rest for a few days, called "Spring Festival"; the police station will increase patrols, preparing for tension, called "New Year's Eve Preparations"; in summary, isn't it because everyone wants to celebrate the old year?</p>
<p>Prostitution activities are frequent and have invaded the lively urban areas; prisoners released from prison after amnesty, philanthropists are donating winter clothes; postmen demand alcohol money, and the authorities have warned them in advance; civil servants are not allowed to dance, and the municipal government is reiterating the ban; where would there be so many tricks in the Gregorian calendar New Year?</p>
<p>Although the Gregorian calendar has been promoted in every way, the Lunar New Year's grand occasion has never declined. Although the "underworld gate" is more difficult to pass than the "Yangguan gate," everyone has not reduced their courage and interest in struggling to pass the gate. In this way, year after year, from birth to death, only the Lunar New Year seems to always be an indispensable embellishment and decoration in everyone's life history. The facts are all there, clear at a glance!</p>
<p>From this, we can also see a little bit of our moral sentiments: nothing in the world can escape the general rule of "disliking the old and liking the new," but we can do the opposite. We seem to ignore the "new" year, with irony in our hearts, but we treat the "old" year very differently, with drums beating, firecrackers shaking the ground, peach charms on every door, and incense smoke lingering, showing how enthusiastic! How nostalgic! Classical simplicity, dreamlike persistence; we are pursuing comfort and discovering hope in "old" things! Who says that people's hearts are not as good as before and that the world is dying?</p>
<p>However, there is also a regret: on one side of the road, vendors are loudly promoting price reductions, and on the other side, lawyers' announcements of liquidation have been posted next door. Shanghai is a city supported by businessmen, so in this case, the Lunar New Year is inevitably felt to be much more disappointing.</p>
<p>Precisely;</p>
<p>Business is booming? Frozen crabs!</p>
<p>Wealth is flourishing! Flirting corpses.</p>
<h3>Also Discussing Borrowing Umbrellas</h3>
<p>— Shao Zhenhe</p>
<p>After Reading "Talking About Bankers"</p>
<p>Overture</p>
<p>The article "Talking About Bankers" begins by quoting a literary figure's definition of a banker, saying that a banker is someone who "lends you an umbrella on a sunny day, and takes it back when it rains." The following is the author's own extended discussion. The tone, while somewhat playful, is indeed based on facts and has a history. Assuming that the literary figure's words can be compared to a quick sketch of a banker, then Deng's article is like an X-ray film of a banker, providing a transparent view.</p>
<p>However, it must be said, "Being obscured by one note, and thus being ignorant of the whole picture" is also unavoidable. The tragic scene that I personally witnessed, in comparison, has some slight discrepancies. Because the story was performed so vividly and movingly that it is impossible to erase from my mind. Here, I also use Deng's approach to start with an opening statement:</p>
<p>Umbrellas, borrow in, borrow out, borrow as much as you like.</p>
<p>Sunny days, rainy days, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Just, be careful when dealing with the blind.</p>
<p>Especially, close friends and relatives, how close is close? How good is good? You have to understand it clearly and figure it out.</p>
<p>After the opening statement, let's get to the main topic:</p>
<p>A Banker</p>
<p>I have a friend who is a prestigious banker, but unfortunately, he comes from a scholarly background. This is not to say that scholars are not good bankers, but in fact, a strong scholarly atmosphere is not always suitable. You must know that bankers have basic requirements! The mind, vision, means, scheming, temper, physique, and even the strength of their legs (without leg strength, they can't stand firm) all require special skills to be qualified. My friend not only lacked these many qualities of a banker from head to toe, but also failed to grasp even the most basic facial expressions. Moreover, he has a most serious flaw, which is that he likes to "treat people kindly," specializing in borrowing umbrellas on sunny days and lending them out on rainy days. This is because he is a scholar, values ​​emotions, and fears trouble, and will take good words at face value. However, borrowing an umbrella on a sunny day is so easy; lending it out on a rainy day is so popular, so he kept doing it that way. Doing, doing, and problems arose!</p>
<p>The Blind Man Borrows an Umbrella</p>
<p>Last September, there was a period when money was tight. Naturally, this is what is called a rainy day. My friend usually has good credit and is honest, so for most people it's a rainy day, but for him, it's still a "partly cloudy" state. Umbrellas coming in still flowed in continuously, but the umbrellas lent out had problems at this time. Some said the rain was heavy and refused to return it, asking for an extension. Some even treated the borrowed umbrella as their own. What a joke! A real joke! Haven't you heard the story of "The Blind Man Borrowing an Umbrella" on the radio? I never thought that this well-known humorous story would actually be played out on my friend. As a result, his sunny day turned into a rainy day, and light rain turned into a downpour. It is said that one of the people who borrowed an umbrella from my friend was his closest relative. Being close, he naturally got the news first. As soon as he learned that my friend's umbrellas were being withheld, he was the first to demand the immediate return of the umbrella. After that, others knew that his closest relative was asking for an umbrella, how could they fall behind and show weakness, so they gathered around and forced him to return the umbrellas. So my friend had to return the umbrellas he borrowed, but he couldn't get back the umbrellas he lent out. Between laughter and tears, he felt a shortage of funds! He found that he couldn't balance things! He had no choice but to return all the umbrellas he had accumulated over thirty years to the umbrella owners. If it wasn't enough, he mortgaged the house he had lived in for twenty-five years to return the umbrellas. If it wasn't enough, he sold all the furniture up and down to return the umbrellas. If it wasn't enough, he priced the more delicate and valuable porcelain bowls in the kitchen to return the umbrellas. If it wasn't enough, he also included his beloved Bai Na Ben Twenty-Four Histories, several scattered collections of the Four Collections, plus a few volumes of Ming and Qing woodblock books, all to compensate for the umbrellas.</p>
<p>A Family in Tears</p>
<p>In seventy-two hours, a happy family was torn apart! Finally, on October 4th, dragging a wife who had just been diagnosed with lung disease and was taking medicine, and five boys and girls who were not yet self-sufficient, he left Shanghai quietly with tears in his eyes! Because he treated me as a confidant, he wrote me a letter. The letter was written like a prose poem, and I shed a lot of tears of sympathy for him! Moreover, between the lines, I could guess a little about his recent situation: although it may not be like what Yuan Zhonglang said, "begging in the houses of singing girls, sharing meals from the plates of lonely old men." However, "in a disheveled state, not knowing what tomorrow will bring" is indeed what he is experiencing!</p>
<p>The motivation for my writing this article is not to show any bias towards bankers or non-bankers, nor is it to oppose borrowing umbrellas in and out. To sum it up, it still comes down to the opening statement above! Let me write it again:</p>
<p>Umbrellas, borrow in, borrow out, borrow as much as you like.</p>
<p>Sunny days, rainy days, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Just, be careful when dealing with the blind.</p>
<p>Especially, close friends and relatives, how close is close? How good is good? You have to understand it clearly and figure it out.</p>
<h3>"Unfavorable to Go Out" and "Not Suitable for Construction"</h3>
<p>— Wu Yu</p>
<p>The following story, although a fable, has profound meaning.</p>
<p>A certain father and son were both staunch believers in superstition, and in everything they did, they had to consult the almanac to choose auspicious or inauspicious days to proceed.</p>
<p>One day, the father was about to go out to collect debts, so he picked up the almanac to check it. Coincidentally, this day was "unfavorable to go out." He was extremely distressed, thinking hard and unable to come up with a solution. Suddenly, he thought of a way. He thought, "Unfavorable to go out" means I shouldn't go out through the "door," right? Can't I drill a hole in the wall and go out? He immediately started digging a hole in the wall and crawled out. But when half of his body had crawled out, the wall collapsed because the foundation was not good. Bricks, tiles, and dirt piled up on his body. He screamed. The son came out upon hearing the sound. The father said, "Son, quickly drag me out! I'm about to be crushed to death!" The son listened, but didn't immediately rescue him. Instead, he ran to the inner room to check the almanac and came out, saying: "Father, today is "not suitable for construction." I think you should lie there for another day! I'll come and drag you out tomorrow."</p>
<h3>On New Year's Eve Dinner</h3>
<p>— Tianhong</p>
<p>"New Year's Eve Dinner" is full of the Chinese ethical spirit;</p>
<p>"New Year's Eve Dinner" occupies an important position in folklore.</p>
<p>"Are you returning home for the New Year, sir?"</p>
<p>Then "New Year's Eve Dinner" is the symbol of "celebrating the New Year." Countless "families" are barely maintaining the Chinese social structure. This is the basic and pitiful unit. In this kind of varied unit, it is actually so empty! For many hard-working couples, "home" is just their inn. "New Year's Eve Dinner" gives it substantial content. Although it's simple food, sitting down to eat in the warm candlelight, thinking about the hard work of the year, thinking about the struggle of the year, struggling on the line of life, how much bitterness? How much joy? Only in this unit can you experience it, can you understand it. What kind of emotions, what kind of taste is it to eat this meal!</p>
<p>If you are not Chinese, if you are Chinese but haven't struggled in society for a year, the Chinese "New Year's Eve Dinner" has no meaning for you. People without life's twists and turns, their "New Year's Eve Dinner" is also bland and tasteless. The glory of "New Year's Eve Dinner" should belong to people who work seriously and diligently, and should not be shared by those who are lewd and shameless. What have they done this year? How much blood and sweat of others does their New Year's Eve Dinner contain?</p>
<p>An old mother, in the warm candlelight, prepares a simple meal, thinking of her distant traveling son. With trembling hands, she fills a bowl of rice, puts on a few pieces of vegetables, and prepares a pair of chopsticks, counting it as eating "New Year's Eve Dinner" together, wishing her distant traveling son peace and health. This kind of short story occurs in countless families, and it contains a serious and devout Chinese ethical spirit.</p>
<p>Chinese society is so broken, and the various ways of eating "New Year's Eve Dinner" also contain the above-mentioned spirit. It is a stubborn and indestructible force. The New Year's Eve Dinner in a broad sense is eaten back and forth among friends and relatives, but the truly meaningful New Year's Eve Dinner is in his "home," in this real social cell, "New Year's Eve Dinner" produces positive life values.</p>
<p>Russians like to discuss life, Chinese people taste life, and "New Year's Eve Dinner" is the most obvious manifestation.</p>
<p>Weekend</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Prosperity of Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Drama</p>
<p>This Peking Opera charity performance jointly organized by eleven groups in this city, which lasted for fourteen days from January 8th, is unprecedented in terms of scale and duration. Famous actors from the North and South, leading male and female roles, perform at the same time. With Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu for female roles, and Tan Fuying, Chen Datao, Yang Baosen, and Li Shaochun for male roles, it is not easy to see so many even in Beijing. It can be called an unprecedented event.</p>
<p>The repertoire is also very complete. In addition to "Red Mane Horse," the evening of "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" was particularly wonderful. The "Linked Rings" by Li Shaochun and Yuan Shihai, the "Sangyuan Meeting" by Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying, capped with Dr. Mei's and the three great bearded actors Chen, Yang, and Zhao's complete "Visiting Mother," are truly all worth watching. Li Shaochun's appearance on stage at 7:30 is indeed rare. Yu-school famous bearded actor Chen Dalou has returned from Beijing with a reputation and has been in Shanghai for a long time. This time he also participated in the charity performance "Visiting Mother" as the messenger, playing the fourth son, singing and acting well from stealing the order to seeing his mother. His performance is above Yang Baosen and Zhao Peixin. The ease and beauty of his hanging beard deserves praise from the audience. Chen was the most popular in the whole play.</p>
<p>This charity performance had so many requests from all parties in advance that several famous actors could not cope, so it was changed to a joint performance, with unified planning and distribution, which reduced a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>On the first night of "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," during the scene in the palace, Zhao Peixin forgot to miss two sentences during the fast-paced duet, which made Dr. Mei rush to catch up. The next day, the scene in the palace was changed to be sung by Yang Baosen. Performing opera is indeed not easy.</p>
<p>Planes crash one after another, but those who travel still travel. Although Li Shifang was killed in Qingdao, Tan Fuying and his son, and Xiao Changhua, etc., still took a plane when returning to Beijing this time, which is quite courageous, and they have now safely arrived in Beijing.</p>
<p>Young male actor Jiang Miaoxiang will be marrying off his son Shao Xiang at the Nanhua Restaurant at 3:00 this afternoon. Invitations were widely sent out a week ago. Jiang has excellent personal connections and a wide range of acquaintances, and it is expected that many people will come to congratulate him.</p>
<p>It was previously rumored that Kun female actor Tong Zhiling would marry a wealthy businessman, but it has now been learned that this is not true. She still lives in Gancun, Luban Road, but often frequents social gatherings. It is said that she will go to a theater in Nanjing to perform during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Two Good Movies</h3>
<p>— Zhang</p>
<p>Movie</p>
<p>"Madame Curie" and "The Great Dictator" are the best two first-run movies this week. Both are biographical films, but the former is serious (but not dull), and the latter is a bit richer in jokes because it tells the story of the famous American humorist Mark Twain. The story of the Curie couple is adapted from "Madame Curie Biography" written by their youngest daughter Eve, so it is quite faithful. However, the process of splitting pitchblende and radium, which they tried 5,677 times over four years before succeeding, is only lightly touched upon with a few shots on the screen—in fact, the suffering they endured in their difficult struggle in a poor environment at that time was more than this.</p>
<p>"Scalpers" will be active</p>
<p>In another three or four days, the Lunar New Year will arrive, and as usual, it will be a time to joyfully stroll around and laugh. Movie theaters will be crowded as usual, and scalpers will inevitably become active again. It is said that the authorities of various movie theaters are taking measures in advance to prevent this. Some want to purchase coupons with certificates, some want to sell tickets in advance, and some entrust "Mou Deli Company" to make reservations on their behalf. In fact, if police officers can strictly monitor in front of the theater doors, wouldn't things be simpler?</p>
<h3>A Goat-Bodied Man Playing the Flute</h3>
<p>Music</p>
<p>This is a "fantasy painting": a "goat-bodied man" (with a × mark) who is good at playing the Western flute [a monster in Greek mythology] actually appears in the symphony orchestra, no wonder the music master in charge of the baton is also speechless. (Note: "Foreigners" once appeared in the "Fantasia" film.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Sound of the Flute at Night</h3>
<p>— Written by Spanish Azorin, Translated by Yan Dachun</p>
<p>1820. Someone is playing a flute at night, it is an elegant, undulating and deep melody.</p>
<p>If we go to the ancient city from the ancient city gate, we must climb a slope. At the bottom of the slope is a river, a plateau embraces a plain, and between two rows of lush old elm trees, there are benches carved from giant stones; in the haze of the night, their whiteness can be vaguely discerned.</p>
<p>Further away, at the end of the path between the elm trees, at the entrance of the village, a beam of light shines on the road; it shines out from a house. If we walk into the wide porch, there we can see a table, in front of the table is an old weaving loom, and next to it is a slanted writing desk, with several music scores on it. We can also see a short old man with white hair and a child. The child is playing a flute. It is playing a slow harmony, which sounds a bit dull in the stillness of the night.</p>
<p>The houses in the city are crowded around the cathedral, the courtyards are all equipped with clear water pools, and there are many small walkways occupied by retailers and harness merchants, and the large houses are decorated with granite badges. There is a garden behind the palace.</p>
<p>Those rare tourists, once they arrive there, always stay at the Astrella Hotel.</p>
<p>Every night, the public carriage quickly passes through the path between the elm trees near the river. When approaching the house with the light, the sound of wood and iron clashing from the bumpy carriage drowns out the sharp flute sounds for a few minutes. Afterwards, the flute resumes playing in the silence of the night. During the day, the old weaving loom in the house weaves, emitting a uniform tone.</p>
<p>1870. Fifty years have passed. If we want to enter the ancient city, we must pass through the ancient city gate. We get off at the bridgehead and cross the river. It is nine o'clock, a piece of silence. Above, in the gathering place of many old houses, several faint lights can be seen. We abandon the tanning works below—those decayed tanning works next to Seranstin, and climb the slope. We follow the path between the lush hundred-year-old elm trees. In the darkness, it is not easy to distinguish the white spots of the stone benches. Over there, a glow shines on the road.</p>
<p>We hear the sound of a flute. Is it coming from that house? The deep and lengthy harmony is like a line of crystal, about to break.</p>
<p>In the porch, an old man and two children are sitting. One of the children is playing the flute, and the other is watching silently, with joy on his face, his azure blue eyes wide open. The old man sometimes guides the child playing the flute. It has been a long time. A long time ago, this old man was also a child. Every night, in the same place, he plays the same harmony with the same flute.</p>
<p>The carriage passes by, and the deafening sound of wood and iron makes the soft flute sound inaudible for a short time. Then, it sings again in the night.</p>
<p>The old houses above are all asleep, the elm trees beside the path are also asleep, and the river is also asleep.</p>
<p>An hour later, the flute sound stops, and the silent and joyful child leaves there and goes to the city. In the city, in a tall old house next to the square, he studies. He studies very tired before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Tourists rarely visit this village. If you come, you have to stay at the Estrella Hotel, because there is no other hotel. That hotel is located on Navance Road, near Basso and Amudin. Most of the tourists come from the countryside and the Angela Road.</p>
<p>How many years have passed?</p>
<p>In Madrid, in a penthouse, there is a white-bearded man, with those azure blue eyes, just like that smiling child before - staring ecstatically at another child holding a flute and playing a deep and lengthy composition.</p>
<p>The man is dressed very plainly. In his room, there is a table with books on it. With the help of a strong ray of sunlight, several faded book traces can be seen. Hanging on the wall are two beautiful photos, one is a photo of a woman, with a pair of thoughtful beautiful eyes and slender sideburns hanging down to her forehead, and the other is a photo of a girl, as beautiful and thoughtful as the woman.</p>
<p>However, no woman's voice can be heard in this house.</p>
<p>The white-bearded man wrote for a long time, and then took his paper and ran to the street. He went in and out of people's houses, talking to people. He often took those papers back to the room and put them in a drawer, along with other forgotten papers full of dust.</p>
<p>1900. The carriage that used to climb the slope by the river every night and take the path between the elm trees to the ancient city no longer exists. There, a railway station has been built.</p>
<p>In the evening, the train also stops in front of the ancient city, but it stops on the other side of the old bridge and the path between the elm trees. Rarely do any passengers get off. One night, a passenger got off. He was an old man with white hair and blue eyes. He was wearing an old coat and carrying a broken suitcase. The old man read the station, and when he walked to the public carriage, the train had already left the station, heading into the wilderness in the dark.</p>
<p>The public carriage took the guest to the best Estrella Hotel in the city. That hotel is famous for its old brand. Its location—no longer on Navance Road, is now next to a major square, in a towering building.</p>
<p>The white-bearded old man was sitting in the carriage, and the car took him away. When the car drove in front of the hotel next to the square, the old man recognized this house, in which he had spent his childhood.</p>
<p>The waiter settled him in a room, the room where he had recited in his youth. He recognized everything, sat down, sighed deeply, and pressed his hand on his tight chest.</p>
<p>He longed to breathe a little air from an open place, walked out of the hotel, ran through those small paths, and he walked and walked. He arrived on the path between the elm trees. The night was clear and quiet. In the silence came the sound of a flute, a clear sound, reminiscent of a crystal-like thread, it was a slow, deep, old harmony.</p>
<p>A beam of light shone out from a house. The traveler approached, and he saw an old man and a child in the porch. The child was playing a soft harmony on the flute. So the white-bearded old man sat on a stone beside the path, with his hand on his tight chest, sadly recalling the past.</p>
<h3>The First Lie</h3>
<p>— Qian Fan Jun</p>
<p>— Reminiscences of a Dream—</p>
<p>In the autumn of my fourteenth year, I successfully entered middle school. Having fortunately secured first place in the county-wide elementary school graduation examination, I was recommended by the County Bureau of Education for free admission to the county's middle school. The difference in environment between middle school and elementary school was far greater than the difference in academics, and my simple, youthful mind began to grasp the complexities of the world. In particular, the deliberate avoidance between male and female students made me also feel a sense of shame between the sexes. Studying and playing together, which were common in elementary school, had become a warm memory that could never be recovered, like withered flowers, causing a feeling of sadness. Thus, I became lonely, but my heart slowly grew fervent.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, at that time I did not understand "love" and "romance." However, I was attracted to a female classmate who was taller than me and not particularly pretty. She was like the winter sun; when she was gone, I felt cold and lonely. In that state of mind, I wanted to approach her silently. However, I was afraid of interacting with her, because shame had dug a deep trench between us, separating boys and girls on either side of the trench... In such a conflicted state of mind, I began a solitary, unrequited love.</p>
<p>She was a boarding student from afar, and her dormitory was next to our classroom. Those who arrived early could carefully count them as they held their bowls and scurried across the corridor to the dining hall for meals. From a certain morning onward, for her sake, fearing any delay, I became the earliest visitor every day. The sun always rose later than me; I had suddenly become so fond of early risers!</p>
<p>Like an engraved printing block, I leaned against the window sill every day, silently counting their footsteps, watching them enter the dining hall, and greeting them as they came out laughing. Their scurrying would increase the circulation of my blood, and a light glance from her eyes would paint my face with a feverish blush. But my heart was at ease, and the most important matter of the day was thus settled. So, I turned half of my attention back to studying my lessons. It was as if I had something, and every day I endured my own pain, thus obtaining a bit of warmth in my heart...</p>
<p>My parents loved me, my teachers also liked me, and my classmates respected and envied me. My early rising further increased their love for me, their liking for me, and their respect and envy for me. Whenever my parents heard the sound of me getting up, they always added a few words of instruction: "Although studies are important, health is even more important. You need a little more rest!" When the teacher saw me sitting alone in the classroom, they always stroked my shoulder and said, "You should pursue both learning and health together!" When my classmates saw that I had arrived at school before them, they always said, "You already got first place, do you want a special first place?" These words often made me feel pain, I certainly hadn't forgotten my studies... And in their misperception, I hid my secret very well.</p>
<p>Paper cannot contain fire, and studies cannot withstand the test of neglect. In the first monthly exam, I actually dropped to a grade of B. This surprised my parents, surprised my teachers, and surprised my classmates. Thus, the physical education teacher's "famous saying" spread throughout the school: "The intelligence of young people during puberty will decline." I became a witness to this "famous saying"... But the clearest was still myself. Although I regretted that the glory of the past would fade from now on, I rejoiced that my secret would be hidden forever...</p>
<p>From the second month onwards, even she looked at me with disdain. My early rising only made my parents doubly affectionate and the class teacher puzzled. My classmates no longer provoked me. In a more solitary environment, I needed more warmth, and I did not neglect a single morning.</p>
<p>After all, there came a day when I leaned against the window sill as usual, watching them skip and jump into the dining hall, and greeting them as they came out laughing. When I was about to turn half of my attention back to studying my lessons, I suddenly realized that the class teacher's breath was close to my shoulder. I was forced to cry out, fearing what kind of humiliation I would encounter after my secret was discovered...</p>
<p>"Fan Jun! What's wrong? What's wrong? You're too strange!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Silence seemed to be revealing my secret, and terror forced me to blurt out the first lie: "I saw a bearded man..."</p>
<p>A lie earned me the bad name of "seeing a ghost in broad daylight." The teacher and my parents also forced me to rest for a week. But who understands my true heart!</p>
<h3>Comedy</h3>
<p>— Li Wenxun</p>
<p>Mrs. Gao got up today after ten o'clock. The weather was really too cold. Getting up every day was like a kind of torture for Mrs. Gao.</p>
<p>Although she woke up very early, she was a little reluctant to leave the warm blanket. Finally, she made up her mind, jumped out of bed in one go, put on her coat, and sat on the toilet reading the newspaper. This was Mrs. Gao's habit. This always took a full half hour, and then she got up with the greatest determination and began to groom herself in front of the vanity. She washed her face, gargled, powdered herself, drew her eyebrows, applied lipstick, and turned and looked in the full-length mirror. She was satisfied with her waist, hips, chest, back, and hairstyle. A very charming expression moved the old woman greatly, and she stood in front of the mirror in a daze for a long time, then sighed softly. She nodded slightly, and couldn't help feeling a little pity for her own youth-like beauty.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gao—judging by appearance, she was no more than forty years old. She wore a seal fur coat, a red woolen scarf, high-heeled leather shoes, a French cap, glass silk stockings, and her ten fingernails were red and lovely, and pointed and lovely. Her small eyes were full of affection under her crescent-shaped eyebrows. Her cheeks were as coy and red as a virgin's. Her hairstyle was also very young and fashionable. From head to toe, even from her seductive sleeping posture, from her smoking and toilet habits, everything was completely "Shanghai-style." Her breasts and waist, needless to say, were even more "Shanghai-style."</p>
<p>She sat on the velvet sofa reading the newspaper. Zhang Ma brought in a glass of milk. Mrs. Gao said, "Zhang Ma, go to Lu Gao Jian on ×× Road today to buy some braised duck to change the taste."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she took out five thousand dollars from her glass leather bag and handed it to Zhang Ma. The maid, who was in her thirties and had just arrived, said timidly, "Madam, I don't recognize Lu Gao Jian."</p>
<p>"You confused idiot, it's the one we went to buy chicken butts with you last week." Mrs. Gao glared at her, then lowered her head to read the newspaper.</p>
<p>Zhang Ma was a little confused as she walked on the road. Although she had gone to buy it last week, she had long forgotten how to get there. She wandered around aimlessly, not knowing where to go. Finally, with no other choice, she bought five thousand dollars' worth of braised duck from a shop called "Shan San Zhen" and brought it home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gao's sense of smell was very keen. She picked it up and smelled it, and her face suddenly changed. She shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Can you fool me? This is not Lu Gao Jian's duck, take it back and exchange it!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Gao's temper had always been like this. Mrs. Gao was one of Lu Gao Jian's old customers. After eating it too much, she couldn't do without Lu Gao Jian's food. She even developed an addiction, and only Lu Gao Jian's things could satisfy her craving.</p>
<p>Zhang Ma had no choice but to return to the bustling street, turning around and around, her brows furrowed and her face full of worry. Suddenly, she remembered that the last time she went to Lu Gao Jian to buy duck with her madam, there was still a sign paper left in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"I've got a solution, I've got a solution now." She thought happily in her heart.</p>
<p>She hurried home, went to the kitchen first, replaced the Lu Gao Jian's sign wrapping paper, and happily took it to the room, shouting happily:</p>
<p>"Madam, I finally bought it, it was so hard to find."</p>
<p>"You confused idiot." Mrs. Gao glared at her again, then picked it up and smelled it, and couldn't help laughing like an old cat, hehe said:</p>
<p>"This is Lu Gao Jian's duck, the taste is very different!"</p>
<h3>Still Water</h3>
<p>— Dong Fangming</p>
<p>Still Water</p>
<p>This is a pool of dead, still water.</p>
<p>There is no chattering of fish, no chirping of birds, no fragrance of flowers, no human voices. It is just quietly, quietly alone there, as if it has long been forgotten.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a gentle breeze blows past, and ripples appear on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a few streaks of sunset clouds sneak in at the edge of the sky, painting it with a few strokes of splendor.</p>
<p>This moment is beautiful, but it disappears immediately.</p>
<p>A frog jumps in from somewhere, and the edge of the still water has the singing of "ge ge."</p>
<p>This moment is lively, but it also disappears immediately; because the frog also cannot bear the loneliness of the still water.</p>
<p>Only the affectionate breeze and the gentle sunset clouds still come to comfort it from time to time; blowing up ripples for it, painting it with a few strokes of splendor.</p>
<p>But in an instant, they all disappear, disappear, and it is still quietly, quietly a pool of dead, still water.</p>
<p>Plain Candle</p>
<p>A small, plain candle that deeply loves to illuminate this dark, small room.</p>
<p>Every night, when the electric light habitually closes its eyes, when all sounds are silent in the vast darkness, in the desolate and lonely midnight, the candle is my best companion.</p>
<p>It is not needed at grand banquets; it is despised in places of red lights and green wine; all those who are lively in the human world will not remember it; it only lives in dark corners, it lives in the hearts of the lonely.</p>
<p>In the darkness, it peacefully shines. It will not flatter, be trendy, or cajole. It will always be lonely and peacefully emit a faint light, illuminating itself, illuminating the darkness, illuminating lonely eyes.</p>
<p>How many odes of the times, how many sentimental writings, are resonating on the heartstrings of the lonely, it will not be understood by all those who are lively in the human world.</p>
<p>It burns, emitting light and heat. It is always a sinner of the darkness, warming the hearts of the lonely, sacrificing its body.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever seen a bean-like candlelight in the immense darkness and cheered and danced? It not only warms the hearts of the lonely, but also illuminates countless people groping in the darkness.</p>
<h3>Black Stocking Girl</h3>
<p>— Fougeron</p>
<p>(Famous modern French painting)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 154</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The two exchanged blows with their weapons, and the person stumbled back three steps. Squatting low, they assumed a half-sitting, half-kneeling posture, holding the sword with both hands, the sharp point facing He Jian. This posture indicated that the person was a woman; He Jian was, of course, immediately aware. The woman was rather short but quite sturdy, without any delicate or graceful figure. Her head and face were covered with a white veil, making it impossible to see her features, but she was wearing a dark, fitted outfit. If it weren't for that white veil covering her head and face, He Jian would have mistaken her for a member of the Black Dragon Society.</p>
<p>What does "Hirano Sect" mean? It is a sect of Japanese swordsmanship. There are many sects of Japanese swordsmanship; famous families all have a sword master, and each lineage has a few different skillful moves. This "Hirano Sect" occupies the position of the orthodox leader among the various sects, so it is naturally powerful. When Xian He Jian turned around to meet the attack, he was already surprised, because judging from the sword's movements, he knew that her swordsmanship had already reached the seventh level, and he wasn't necessarily much better than her. The only way to win was to use oiling.</p>
<p>The two exchanged blows, and a formal battle began immediately. In the seventh level, the outcome cannot be calculated in rounds; sometimes the winner is decided in just one round, and there is no fixed length of time between the first and second rounds. Sometimes it is very short, but sometimes it takes ten minutes or more, with both sides fighting fiercely. In the midst of fierce fighting, although there are retreats and advances, they are all using their own spirit and aura to confront each other. However, this female swordsman had a rather impetuous nature. In the first few rounds, there were still one or two minutes of fierce fighting without engaging weapons. When she saw that He Jian was using an oily fighting style, she changed to an offensive posture. After attacking about ten times, she suddenly passed the long sword to her right hand and drew a seven-section staff from her side, attacking even more fiercely. As a result, He Jian saw that the opponent was actually a formidable enemy, because wielding blades with both hands was rare even among men; this woman was actually so audacious, which showed that her skills were very high, and he had to be very careful.</p>
<p>Who knew that just when He Jian was fighting one against one and felt that the opponent was not easy to deal with, he suddenly caught sight of several swordsmen from the Black Dragon Society falling to the ground at the same time. One of the enemies, who had gained the upper hand on the opposite side, flew towards He Jian, seemingly to support the audacious woman and attack him together. At this moment, a distant, muffled, steady sound like "shakuhachi" (Japanese flute) suddenly came, sounding like a ghostly wail carried by the wind. Immediately, a similar muffled sound echoed from under the trees on this side, making him very surprised and suspicious, not knowing what was going on. None of his own men were visible, and he couldn't even get a signal or other warning.</p>
<p>The sound of the flute under the trees was choked and mournful. The person who had come forward to attack had already rushed to He Jian like a gust of wind. He Jian was prepared and feigned a move, then moved two steps to the side, so the three of them formed a triangular formation. The person who came up was also a small person, dressed exactly like the female swordsman; but his movements were much more agile, and his body looked like a woman's, with a slender and graceful waist. His head and face were also covered with a white veil.</p>
<p>Just as the three of them were about to adjust their swords, the person who had arrived later took only one step forward, feigned a swing of his weapon, and then spoke. He was facing He Jian, but the words were directed to his accomplice. Hearing the voice, He Jian knew it was Pingzi again:</p>
<p>"Sister Chunzi, how is it?... Have you tested his weight, probably?... The flute is playing, we should go." Then he changed his tone: "Brother Qin, what kind of hero are you being?... Your comrades have already retreated safely, hee hee..." As he spoke, the small groups dueling in other directions had already dispersed their formations. The mixed group retreated while defending. The strange thing was that the members of the Black Dragon Society didn't seem to intensify their pursuit, as if they were somewhat hesitant, allowing the foreign swordsmen to retreat.</p>
<h3>Living in Paradise</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiang</p>
<p>Do you know the tricks of how people in paradise live? Here is a story for you.</p>
<p>A young master in paradise only had a thousand dollars in his pocket. He wanted to live a young master's life for a day, but a thousand dollars is so pitiful in this high-priced life! But he has a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>He got out of bed. As usual, his wife was the first to go to the Tiger Stove to get hot water. A hundred dollars for hot water, half of it was left in the thermos, and half of it was used to wash his face.</p>
<p>The sun shone on the courtyard, and it was time to buy groceries. He took the grocery basket to the street and ran to the entrance of the dim sum shop, swaggering in.</p>
<p>"Bring me an order of pork soup dumplings," he shouted.</p>
<p>The waiter brought it to him.</p>
<p>He hunched over the corner of the dining table to eat. First, he ate the skin of the soup dumplings, drank the soup, and while the diners weren't paying attention, he wrapped the meat filling in a lotus leaf, looking like he had bought it from Lu Gao Jian.</p>
<p>After paying the bill, he went to the vegetable market and bought two hundred dollars worth of cabbage, filling the grocery basket to the brim.</p>
<p>"Meatballs in vegetable soup," the young master ordered his wife when he returned home.</p>
<p>It was time for lunch, and his wife knowingly cooked the meat filling and cabbage together for the two of them to eat.</p>
<p>"What kind of vegetable is it?" a neighbor friend walked in and asked.</p>
<p>"Meatballs in soup," the young master replied cheerfully.</p>
