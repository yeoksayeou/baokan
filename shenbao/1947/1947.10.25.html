<h3>美正研究援華辦法　傳魏使報吿已批准　軍事顧問團組織將擴大</h3>
<p>（合衆社南京廿四日電〕合衆社廿四日有理由可相信，美總統杜魯門及國務卿馬歇爾已批准魏德邁之報告，主張在軍事上及財政上援助中國。據悉：彼等目前在研究實施此一計劃之最佳方法，即擴大駐華軍事顧問國，並貸與中國借款。傳彼等刻在物色一適宜之美國軍人，以主持此計劃。僉信：魏氏之報告中，已提出若干美人之名字，但爲若干原因尚無人獲得最後批准。一般深信，魏德邁之主張，在大體上與「生活」雜誌中所刋載之蒲立特援華論相仿，但在小節上略有出入。按蒲立特主張在三年內以十三億美元貸款借給中國，再加直接之軍事援助，至於美國暫緩發表以魏德邁報告爲基礎之聲明及實施對華新政策之原因，此間尚未獲悉。僉信，其主要原因厥爲杜魯門與其顧問尚在酌量實施此計劃之最佳戰略。在考慮中之原因有：　如何可使關於美軍顧問團之總統緊急行政權力予以延長。蓋駐華美軍顧問團乃根據緊急戰時權力而設立，並未獲得國會之批准，若軍事顧問團擴大至魏德邁所主張之範圍，則必須經國會之通過。　在全部計劃呈與國會之前，是否應根據進出口銀行之條例立即作經濟援助，抑等待國會辯論時較好。　關於發表援華計劃間題，目前發表援華計劃勢必延宕馬歇爾援歐計劃之實施，魏德邁所主張顧問團之範圍雖來獲悉，僉信，顧問團將火事擴充。蓋目前軍事團僅有四百餘人。</p>
<p>﹝本報北平廿四日電〕美衆院議員楚德，廿四日下午一時四十分由朝鮮飛抵平。三時　美領館人員舉行會議，聽取有關華北之情報。擬廿四日拜會李宗仁及平軍政各首長。還在平將勾留五六日。楚氏稱，彼在華多年，有固定之漢名，並即執筆直書華文「周以德」三字。按渠素主積極援助中國政府，並屢次抨擊中共。渠遠在一九三九年即於星期週報著文批評美援華物資僅爲援助全球物資百分之三十，且又爲中共佔去一半。渠並稱，共黨爲日本侵華之秘密武器。</p>
<h3>代鑄銀幣問題　中墨尙未作具體接洽　駐華墨大使及楊格顧問均在滬</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社南京廿四日電﹞外次葉公超評墨西哥財長文告「墨西哥可能即將爲中國鑄造銀幣」一事稱：中墨問並未進行關於此事之談判，中國政府亦未正式向墨西哥探詢此項協定之可能性。記渚詢以「中國政府是否有興趣硏究此事之可能性」。葉氏答稱：吾人以前硏究此事，已明瞭採取銀幣之結果如何？同時，上海方面銀行界稱：中國政府在數個月之前已在研究此事，此後中國政府即擬覓取三億四千六百萬元美國銀子借款。據稱：「銀幣」已成爲中國之「不再提及之題目」，蓋中國若採取銀本位後，將喪失國際貨幣基金協會及世界銀行會員國之資格。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕墨西哥財長宣布我政府將請墨西哥代籌銀幣消息後，記者曾向財政及金融當局探詢，據答：自抗戰勝利後，政府因上海造幣廠機器爲敵人拆走，將來整理幣制，需籌輔幣時，勢難供應，迭向各國探詢鑄幣能力及有無代鑄之可能，但非至改革幣制時機成熟，尚無鑄幣之必要，目前尚未有何具體接洽。</p>
<p>〔本報訊﹞墨西哥駐華大使易斯克戴及其僅有之秘書在滬已兩週，尚無返京訊，彼等來滬或與幣制問題有關，又悉：楊格顧問亦在滬。</p>
<h3>本年年底以前　幣制勢須改革　財政當局曾提出計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕此間人士對中。墨進行造幣談判一訊，殊爲軍視。咸認此或爲我將恢復使用銀幣之有力跡象，熟悉財政金融人士談及此事時，多數認改制並非全無不能，據悉：財政當局數月前曾有一側計劃提出，而就當前情勢言，在本年年底以前，貨幣似又有非加改革不可之勢。銀本位雖不一定爲一種進步制度，然外國旣有多量白銀供應，或不失爲一種過渡辦法，至鑄幣等工作，我國亦非全無準備。</p>
<h3>金融界人士　對銀幣意見　認可能造成局部穩定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞墨西舟財長宣布墨國將爲我國鑄造銀幣後，記者特走訪金融界人士，歸納渠等之意見：認爲此訊果屬確實，則必與中美貸款之事相連。因純憑我國因有存銀數量，決不够用。前傳美國將以一部份存銀接濟我國，作爲借款之一部，用以改革幣制，可能即爲此事。日來金融界盛傳美國將貸華十五億美元，證以美外交高級人員之談話，則空穴來風非全無因。將來銀幣發行後，現有之法幣勢必成爲輔幣，如正輔幣之間並無比率之規定，則市塲上勢必發生劣幣驅逐良幣之現象，故推斷銀元與法幣間，勢必規定一比率，而以政府全力加以穩定。至於銀元發行後對於我國經濟之影響，金融界看法不一，但多數則認爲可能浩成局部之穩定。因硬幣有內在價値，且有國際貸款之支持，可使人民對政府之信心提高。同時根據近三十年來我國之貨幣史觀察，此舉至少可使物價波動局部化。</p>
<h3>王外長在日　參觀軍事法庭</h3>
<p>﹝新亞社東京廿四日電﹞我國外長王世杰，廿四日正午與我國駐日代表團長商震將軍同進午餐，並同驅車至東京國際軍事法庭，參觀審訊日本戲犯。王外長曾凝視東條及其他各被告之顏面，似有無限感慨之表情。今晚出席商團長之歡迎晚餐會，廿五日將赴美國代表團之招待會，並同進午餐，商討對日之一般問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿四日電〕國際軍事法庭庭長成比及我國法官梅汝　，廿四日款待王外長，其他法官均曾出席歡迎盛會。</p>
<h3>處理日賠償物資　經部設器材總庫　民營部份下月中運華</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞日本賠償我國工業物資中之民營部份，共計十二萬噸，下月中即可運華。全國計分靑島，上海廣州三港口卸貨，分別轉運至華北華中華南，佔計經由上海港口登岸，約在六萬噸左右。第一批抵達上海者約爲一萬噸，以工具機器爲主。經濟部工商輔導處爲處理此批物資起見，已成立器材總庫，除存儲分配民營已賠償物資外，總聯運華之工礦物資，亦一併由其處理。首批賠償物資之淸單，目下尚無所知，將來抵達後將先存儲於聯總倉庫及其他新建之倉庫，然後由專家估價，以一定之折扣售與民營工廠。如有整套之工廠設備，不能分割出售，且價格過高非單獨廠家所能承購者，當組織聯合工廠，由性質相同之多數廠家聯合</p>
<h3>政院臨時會通過　修正出版法　放寬發行出版尺度</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕前經內部擬定之修正出版法，經行政院於廿四日第十二次臨時會通過，即送交立法院完成立法手續。內長張厲生頃與記者談修正出版法之要旨，在於放寬發行與出版之尺度，同時簡化申請登記手續，換言之，亦即鼓勵出版，發展文化事業也。按原法登記辦法，其登記聲請　須抄送中央宣傳部登記，然後始能送內政部辦理發給登記證事，同時其限期亦規定爲廿八日，現則更爲「十日內」，時間縮短，且不必經過中宣部之登記，只須當地主管政府核定，即可報請內政部發給登記證，是以手續簡單，經過機構亦單純。月廿二日本報）茲分誌臨時會議其他報吿事項及討論事項於次：（下接二版一欄）</p>

<h3>紀念臺灣光復節</h3>
<p>今天爲臺灣光復節，在中華民國歷史上，這是一個足以愉快歡悅的日子。臺省人民團體，爲招上省及外國人士蒞臺遊覧，藉以繁榮社會經濟，促進文化交流，及相互了解起見，特發動臺省各界，以一月之時間，爲慶祝光復節之時期，臺省政府在今天，更要舉行盛大祝典，張院長曁英議會訪華團，亦將先後蒞臺參加。今天的臺灣，正是冠葢製集，萬民慶祝的時會，吾人謹以無限感奮之誠，祝臺灣同胞之幸福，臺省建設之成功，並預祝臺灣前途隨光復的光輝而發揚光大！</p>
<p>臺灣爲我國之一省，位東海與南海之間，形似芭蕉葉，合本島及澎湖列島新南羣島並其他島嶼，而爲臺灣省之總稱。東面太平洋，西隔臺灣海峽與福建相對，東北與琉球羣島相接，南隔巴士海峽與菲律之接合相臨。全境形勢險要，土地肥沃，物產豐薩，計全培面積爲三萬五千元九百六十一方公里强，人口約在六百萬人左右。臺灣的歷史，是毫胞一部多災多難的奮鬥史。艱苦卓約的臺胞，經過幾個世代的憂患，於民國三十四年十月廿五日獲得了，進入了光明。回憶臺變的沉痛過去，情景如在目前。我們鑒於臺灣人民在已往的苦鬥，對茲佳節的來臨，益增欣奮。</p>
<p>由於臺灣形勢的重要，終不幸而遭外力侵擾。明萬曆卅二年（公元一六〇四年），先有荷蘭人入據澎湖，旋即佔據臺灣本年（一六二六）有西班牙人侵臺，　道光廿一年（一八四一）有英人的覬覦行動，光緒九年（一八八三）又有法軍窺臺，雖然這多次侵略都被粉碎，但已暗示臺灣在帝國主義的爭逐中，早已捲入了世界政治漩渦。日本垂涎臺灣，在明代中葉，即有少將式的侵擾，其在實際上據有臺灣，則在佔領琉球（光緒元年，一八七五）後。甲午之戰清廷戰敗，光緒廿一年三月廿三日締結馬關條約之後，日本遂佔有了臺灣，被日本獨佔統治五十年，於兩年前的今天，臺灣日總督安藤利吉大將，向我國政府簽立了降書，至此臺灣重見光明，脫離了外力絆　，重歸祖國的懷抱。這是我國對日八年抗戰的服務生收穫，也臺灣人民歷來苦鬥的成功。</p>
<p>外人覬覦臺灣形勝，垂涎臺灣富源，造成臺灣歷史上多次災難，介中國民族並不忘情臺灣，每一時代災難中，無不為爭取臺灣的自由而奮鬥。這說明了中國是統一的，中華民族是整體的。當荷蘭入統治臺灣卅七年，鄭成功光復了臺灣，成功之子　經，在臺的經營與建設，其光輝　炳史乘。鄭經死後，其子克　斷送了廿三年的光榮歷史，但繼之而來的，有臺人朱一貴，林爽文等先後的光復運動。馬關條約割臺，臺人在志士邱逢甲領導下宣佈獨立，這個獨立運動雖被日軍擊敗，而民族的正義，燭天地貫日月而不朽，永遠照耀着臺灣。日人統治臺灣五十年，充滿半世紀的血淚，臺灣人民沒有屈服過，日入山川均「臺灣民衆的悲哀」一書，曾暴露了日本五十年的苛政，更表露了臺灣人民悲壯奮鬥的歷史。國父領導的革命運動，志在解放臺灣；蔣主席領導的對日評斷，三十四年十月廿五日臺灣的光復，其意議實貫澈了鄭成功，邱逢甲，劉永福的奮鬥，達到了臺灣人民解放的目的。</p>
<p>從上所述，可知臺灣光復的意義，是何等偉大！今天的臺灣，已為中國的一省，政治正走向民主，經濟正走向建設，而未來的前途，實無可限量。我們今天紀念臺灣光復，深覺光復的意義可貴，希望臺灣六百萬人民和地方政府，珍視光復的歷史價值，團結一致，一心一德，共同創造，共同建設。臺灣人民視臺灣為「中國之花園」，我們希望臺灣能開放燦爛之花，建設為三民主義之樂園。臺灣人民多年的苦難，歷代遭遇的辛酸，應該早登幸福康樂之境！願臺灣人民和地方政府，在今天之後，努力來共同建設新臺灣！</p>

<h3>張羣在台談話</h3>
<p>政府決改善台胞生活</p>
<p>〔中央社台北廿四日電〕張院長廿四日下午三時接見各報記者時，發表談話强調台灣經濟地位之重要及政府改善台胞經濟生活之決心。渠稱：「上次魏主席至京，關於穩定台灣金融財政，安定經濟生活，鼓勵出口外銷，已商有若干具體解決辦法。維持台幣制度，在整個幣制改革之前，不致改變。台灣之煤，雖非特殊優民，但現值京滬及華南缺煤之際，台煤內運，當可補充此項需要。內地煤價因統制關係有一定之限價，余此來考究後，當考慮對台產物質外銷問題，台省可供出口之物產甚多，如食糖即爲大宗，日人統治時代，號稱年產一四〇萬噸。他如食鑒，樟腦等等，均可運銷國外，換回外匯及台灣必需之機器與肥料」。關於處理日本領土問題，張氏强調稱，日本應歸還其以武力向我國侵奪之領土，例如琉球應使重歸我國版圖。又張氏今接見中央駐台機關代表時稱：「自明年一月起，將依各地生活費指數，重行調整公務員待遇。至中央駐台機關待遇問題，乃一技術問題，俟返京後會商解決。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿三日電〕澳外長伊伐特相信，現尚無召開對日初步和會之機會，須至明年初始有望，惟渠希望至明年初時，中美蘇三國關於程序之歧見，即能充分消弭，以便該會能順利進行。伊伐特稱，美國在渠訪華府之短期內，正在正式硏究中國外長王世杰所提出之要求中國認爲美國所起草之對日和約草建議，未曾充分限制日本工業潛能，同時亦未對和約締結後之管制日本，充分嚴格規定。　關於和約締結後管制日本問題，中國堅持美國文官統治觀點，不足以有效地防止日本戰爭經濟之車建，惟悉中國王外長深信美國以限制進口加以管制之主張，必能進行圓滿。此間所有各國代表團，希望中國最後放棄與蘇聯一致之主張，即和約起草須不使用否決權，而予亞洲四强中任何一國，對渠等不歡迎之條款，可用否決權加以阻止。此外中美未能獲致協議主要之點，係爲日本締約後之商船數　問題，美國之觀點認爲日本商船應在二三百萬噸之間，此種觀點，爲中國完全拒絕，中國堅特日本有此一半之數已足。惟據消息靈通方面稱，待至和會召開後，此項問題或能設法打開，因中美現在尚相距太遠無法協調也。至於蘇聯是否同意參加十一國和會而不使用否決權問題，迄今尚無表示。但權咸方面消息稱，美國如一且能使中國就範，決進行和約，有無蘇聯參加，皆所不顧。</p>

<h3>校長「悔過」　爲債務抑為姦情？</h3>
<p>蔣儒珍案續審　保長等作證人　陳述調解經過</p>
<p>〔本報訊）華德小學校校長蔣儒珍被控强姦該校十三歲女生朱月仙，張菊英二人案，昨晨在地院刑一庭由庭長孟庭軻續審，苜由朱月仙複述受害經過。繼傳證人朱長寳，朱稱：「常州人，廿八歲，住小桃園街四十弄四號，業壽器行，是朱胡茂珠的二房東，不認識蔣儒珍，也不知奸情。五月卅一日由杭回滬，兩天後保長　元淸來找我，請我妻領他去見朱胡茂珠，代蔣儒珍調解」。西倉路廿五保保安長鄭元淸證稱：「與蔣為多年老友，六日初蔣來找我，同往城隍廟喝茶，謂與校中一女生，因借錢事誤會，請我</p>
<p>出面調解</p>
<p>，我即邀朱長賓太太同至朱胡茂珠處商談，朱胡氏謂須蔣本人去談，即可解決，我曾謂：大事化小，小事化無，大家原諒一下也就完了」。朱胡氏則稱：「六月四日報告蓬萊警分局，六月五日鄭元淸來，我即提出三項條件要蔣答應：　登報道歉，　寫悔過書，　具負責書，直到朱月仙長大成人出嫁後男家無話競爲止。鄭說</p>
<p>條件太苛</p>
<p>，經磋商後，我答應只要蔣寫一封悔過書，鄭即將蔣所寫悔過書給我看，我因書上所寫「我（蔣自稱）常帶朱月仙至城隍廟玩，引起誤會，很抱歉，請原諒，庭詰蔣儒珍對其所犯罪行，是否承認？蔣供稱：「六月一日我去找鄭保長，託他調解，下午我即至江陰，悔過書是在五月廿九日寫的，道歉為的是對借錢</p>
<p>發生誤會</p>
<p>。」孟庭長即詰問「你為債</p>
<p>權人，朱胡氏是債務人，爲何你反向她道歉」？蔣略加思索，答云：「因為她叫流氓恐嚇我」。未由蔣妻馮氏供述悔過書由鄭元淸帶回交彼後即丟掉，無法覓尋。庭論本案尚須調差，改期再審，將退庭，蔣忽又謂「寫悔過書實在是解釋我常帶女生至城隍廟遊玩」。聞下次再審時將設法傳詢裁縫店老關係某作證。</p>
<p>攜車進口須符規定舊車換新準發新照擬定限制汽車辦法草案俟市政會議通過後施行</p>
<p>關於本市私人汽車實施限制辦法，業經市府依照中央法令擬定草案，俟市政會議通過後施行，英草案內容如后：〔甲）私人汽車限制辦法：　抽　核减與配油，必須同時實行。　私人自國外　車進口，須有下列情形方可照准：（1）合於院頒私人使用汽車限制辦法規定中之醫師，銀行，工礦，新聞社等有資格使用汽車者。（2）在卅六年十二月一日以前，業已裝船啓運在途中，而具有證明者。（3）須具結保證在進口一年內，不在木市轉售者。以上三項，當由輸管會，市府公用局等有關機關，組織審核委員會，加以審核發照。。凡已領有汽車牌照之任何私人或私法人，如將其使用之舊車掉換新車者，姑准以原領照更正登記，換發新照。　營業小客車及營業貴車，依照限制辦法規定之汽車運輸業每一商號，以在本年八月三十一日以前已登記領照，或已付款訂購，並已起運在途者，准予使用，並定於十一月十五日一千，一律辦理登記，仍須嚴查後再行發照。</p>
<p>外埠車輛</p>
<p>（乙）外埠領照車輛駛入本市省照下列辦法辦理：　在本年十月十四日以前駛入本市，已照例登記，亦繳納捐稅者，一律照原存本市者辦理。　臨時過境之車輛，照例登記納稅後，發給該月份之購油證，以一次爲限。　以後外埠汽車長駐本市者，應由其本人自行向該地主管機關，將共所得汽油配額轉至本市，再行發給執照，並發配油證。（丙）私人或私法人汽車不規定限額者：關於民辦救火會之救火車，救護車，私立醫院之救護車，商辦公共汽車及長途汽車，汕公司之油　車，商辦公用事業公司之工程材料車等，如添置新車，一律經有關主管機關審核發給執照。</p>
<p>公務車輛</p>
<p>（丁）關於公務車發照辦法：　中央在滬各行政機關及國營事業機關，’申請新車照，一律須經中央主管部會正式函電證明，惟送郵車及送電報之機　軍，只需本市郵電主管當局正式證明即可。　中央或地方軍政機關駐滬辦事處或通訊處申請登記發新照者，當請行政院核准後，始予發給。　市營公共汽車及市府各局處如須添置車輛者，一律須經市長核准。　行政院特准配售配給或　交之車輛，由公用局核發執照。　聯總英美駐華軍事顯問代表團，暨各國駐華領事館公務車，當照優待辦法發照。　國軍軍事車執照由國防部辦理，英美軍軍車由公用局核發。</p>
<p>市府奉令辦理機關節用汽車</p>
<p>市府又奉行政院訓令指示關於限制汽車使用各點：　各機關應儘量减少汽車數量與用油量，並應呈報本年每月平均用油量，再就原量至少核减百分之十。　各機關汽車應集中管理，除正副首長得專用汽車一輛外，其餘汽車一律歸該機關公用。　各機關汽車之調配，應以公務需要爲限，接送員工之交通車，應配量减少。</p>
<p>現有車輛</p>
<p>各機關應將其現有汽車種類數量爲力及職員人數報院備核。市府奉令後已在核辦中，惟因政院原令對公務車僅囑節約使用，並未加以限制，誠恐以後新汽車及被取締之汽車，均將以公務車名義變相出現，汽汕配額無法應付，故擬呈請行政院對機關亦加限制云。</p>
<p>市府請示兩點</p>
<p>此外市府現尚向行政院請示二點：　有資格使用汽車者，及公務機關與不合規定之私人汽車賣買，是否應予過戶。　在十月十四日以前申請登記之汽車，當時因證件不齊，或證件齊全而需　驗，故逾期未發執照，以後證件補全或檢驗合格者，可否准予發照過戶。</p>

<h3>台灣光復節　光明的展望</h3>
<p>〔本報台北廿二日航訊〕本文發表時，記者遙想起來，總該是台省光復兩週年了吧。　六百三十萬台胞和到台灣的先頭部隊，都曾目覩說親受前年十月二十五日光復時可歌可泣的偉大熱情塲面，可是，我們有權利可以這樣說，今後的日子希望能顯現出更多的光明！在苦難中展開更大的光明！　初旅斯土的旅者(彭學沛先生就是其一)，第一個印象沒有不感到美麗愉快的。給檳鄉點綴着的寬敞馬路，在亞熱帶的暖風裏搖擺着頎長的背影，疏落的人，閒散地走着，帶有南洋和日本風味的景色，使來目京滬的人，不再關着條火的氣息，人肉的腥味。一種浮面的安定，意識着這確是一塊樂土。是的台灣有較內地安定的環境，有海島情調，有較具基礎的建設，有文化平衡發展的進步的表現……可是，躭久了呢，任何人總會感到單調，枯燥，沉悶的重壓。台灣畢竟是個小島，小天地。一到海空交通斷絕時，幾乎有把島民窒息的可能。</p>
<p>敵產的接收　從版岡上，我們接收了海島，接收了日本人下了三十年苦功而留下來的一筆遺產。單以日產而講，記帳價値已在五五六億以上，這還僅限於省內接收的，中央機關接收的不在其內。我們更接收了日本人的工廠，礦產·企業，和一切交通運輸工具。　二年來，我們目鑿着大部份工廠從廢墟裏恢復起來，艱巨的工程重行建築起來，河川堤防修建起來，公路上也行駛着最新穎的汽軍。有若干地方，却表現了超日本全盛時代的成績。這裏有眞實地埋頭苦幹和勇於學習的靑年，技術工作者，硏究者，他們要求的祗是在溫飽中能替台灣做一點事，緘默着多做一點事，聽事實來證明我們可能接受這份遺產。雖然其中不是沒有假冒的「行家」，更不是沒有做「淘金夢」的貪汚者流。</p>
<p>完善的方策　魏主席蒞台，第一步就是提高匯率，台幣到現在還未遭遇沒落的命遝。他接受民衆的意見，爲了救濟失學失業，也伸出手來歡迎外來的投資。半年來台幣調整了三次，最近極有可能再調整，對於物資雖未見「調」和「節」，而對狂漲的物價亦許較能收效。但人們莫不期待當局能有計劃地實行完善的政策。　台灣這條經濟防波堤是脆弱的，產銷企業機構，不可能聽其獨善其身，也不可能聽其奄奄一息，一任其各自發展或毀滅，必需緊密地配合，成爲一個完整的生產體系，相互聲應，否則步調便零亂，辦法使洛了空。</p>
<p>樂觀的前途　台灣不是中國的「積穀倉」，在化學肥料大量供應和外匯取得上，都可以理解中央是以上海第一，台灣第二。中央重視台灣，台胞和現在的工作者，都該忍受苦難，更該珍視台灣。　台灣的前途沒有足以悲觀的理由。去年光復紀念時，蔣主席親臨一手扶持的島省，對收復以後的民衆演講幾乎流下了淚，今年張院長和翁文灝先生又將同來參加盛典。人們所引以爲喟嘆的，固然是兩年來人事的變幻，而更大的希望，將是面臨光復第三年財政建設生產之如何克服難關。只要國家有辦法，台灣總是有前途的。希望台胞認識目己，認識世界，因爲這原是數千萬軍民的鮮血和頭顱，費時八年才爭取來的。(特派員江暮雲)</p>

<h3>兩姓爭執地業　永泰發生大械門　傳與競選有關</h3>
<p>〔本報福州廿一日訊〕動員三千餘人，爲了祖傳地業的爭執，舉行大械鬥，死傷多人，算是給一向安定的福建起了一陣比較大的紛擾。　這件血案發生在民風淳樸，和善的閩東永泰縣龍門村後埔坪地方，起因是爲了一塊荒蕪土地地業的爭執，涉訟數年。原告林族族長林仕永等，以該地乃其先祖南宋理學家林羽講學之听，因年久失修，房屋倒塌，僅餘一片平地古蹟，爲林族佔據，被告汪族代表汪家祥等，則以該林族先祖林羽講學之地，乃在該縣卅二都運峰鄕覆鼎峰之麓，有朱考亭鐫「龍門」二字於石，有該縣縣誌可考，而林族子弟，散居各縣。</p>
<p>以訛傳訛</p>
<p>以汪族所世居之龍門村，爲其先祖講學之遺址。原告初訴於該縣司法處，再訴於閩高等法院。均經敗訴駁回。　汪族人士以該地地權旣經法院依據系爭地無崖可指無灘可證裁定原告無理混爭，該埕地仍歸汪族所有，地權旣明，乃於數月前鳩工興建宗祠一座，林汪乃毗鄰而居，林族睹此情狀，懷恨在心。　永泰林姓，素以望族見稱，族人散居閩東林森，閩淸，古田各縣，爲數頗夥。早在數月前，林姓族人即有與汪族</p>
<p>一決雌雄</p>
<p>之醞釀，此事卒於本月十三日爆發。　是日，林族動員族丁三千餘人，或携兀　，或執槍械，分自閩淸，古田各鄉擁集永泰龍門村，聲勢浩蕩，汪族以人數較寡，無法與敵，該村卒爲林家軍攻入，汪族死傷數人，被擄二十五人解往閩淸，餘皆遠遁，林軍乘勝，毀屋十餘棟，却去汪族財物三百餘祖，後經縣府派隊</p>
<p>趕往彈壓</p>
<p>，林族子弟當場被捕一百餘人，一塲風波始告平息。　事後據云此次大械鬥中，有前永泰著匪林仙妹等三人參加，林姓族人所攜之槍械則多爲各鄕鄉公所所借用，似此不啻縱匪作亂，而且鄉公所竟以武器供給，無異助長騷亂，省當局及各界成表極端重視。治安當局復於日昨據報該林族正作</p>
<p>二次械們</p>
<p>之醞釀，省府今特派視察黃乃廢趕往永泰，會同地方各界調處。以免事態之再度擴大。？　至於兩姓爭地糾紛，由來已久，爲何必於此時爆發呢？各方揣測頗多，據記者探悉：與競選事不無關聯。按：林族族長林棟近在該縣競選國代，有謂林氏特策動此次糾紛，乘接召集族人擁護林之當選，有調係林之相對競選人利用此糾紛，以加罪於林，貶損林之聲譽。（派記者陳正予)</p>

<h3>重慶偉大建設之一　下水道工程</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿二日航訊〕下水道是一個都市的基本建設。八十年前，法國巴黎即曾耗資三千五百萬美金，建築肝構七十五英里與支持六百五十英里。美國波士頓，亦早在五十年前，耗資一千五百萬美金，築成幹溝一百二十五英里與支溝一千二百英里。而遠處西南的陪都，才在民國三十六年六月，化費十五億四千八百七十八萬二千元，修建了第一期二○點九○六公里的溝管工程。</p>
<p>專家毛理爾　卅四年一月，美國國務院派了一位衛生工程專家毛理爾（AB.Morrill）來重慶。這位六十多歲的陸軍上校，曾向最高當局建議：設若重慶市有條完善的下水迪，每年可以減少百分之十的死亡率，而且，永遠不會再有大雨成災的現象。(毛理爾幷沒有說謊話：今年暑期，重慶就沒有發生霍亂。)　毛理爾是位値得敬崇的工程師，重慶老百姓全知道這位外國人曾經下過陰溝路勘。他沒要中國政府分文，但下水這工程，却因他協助設計，減少了十億元的費用。他多智。謙虛，幷不固執自己的成見。當羅竟忠處長認爲：在中國的情形下，街道兩旁修築兩條溝管，比較馬路中心做一條溝管適宜，毛理爾也就點頭：「OK」。</p>
<p>成長罹竟忠　雖然在乾隆年間，重慶已經開始了溝渠的敷設，可是根據水力學的原理，大規模的，有系統的設計下水道工程，還在卅五年十月。開苜，重慶百萬市民幷不了解下水道的重要。羅處長究竟是留學比利時沙城大學的博士，有他一套特殊作風，訓練了一批幹部，遊說民間，一直使居民自動要求遷居了，工程處才開始動工。計遷拆民宅凡八十棟，人工動員了四十萬。</p>
<p>雨量的估計　在重慶。建設下水道工程，比其他都市較方便的，就是：坡大。但缺點則是：本市地形團欠精確，舊溝綫路紀戴不全。下水道工程處成立，僅祗繪製全市詳細地圖，分區分綫測量計劃，都費了四個月的時期。而最爲懲覺困難的，還是對於雨量週期的預測。假使將雨量估計錯誤：溝渠過大，徒耗工程，溝渠太小，又易氾濫。北暗巾央氣象研究所的雨量紀錄表，只有民國卅年至卅一年的紀錄，不够應用。因此，主要的仍是依賴上海徐家匯天文合的雨量紀錄。〔根據金陵大學農經糸美籍敎授布克(J.L.Buck)所著「中國土地利用統計資料」一書所載：上海每月最大的平均雨量爲一八八公厘，重慶一八一公厘。至於廿四小時內最大雨量，上海爲二○○公厘，重慶是二○八公厘。)</p>
<p>污水的排拽排洩汚水和雨水是下水道的功能，如果下水道工程次第完成，而市民對於萬便得處理，仍襲舊習，隨處傾倒積汚，穢流四播，即有良好的下水道，對於全市的清洗衛生，還是無濟於事。工程處有鑒於此，在第二期工程中，業已計劃修築公共厕所四十幢，取消公厠中的糞池，將糞便直接以瓦管通入溝渠。另外，爲私人住宅承辦汚水接管。據聞，已有二千戶居民請求接裝，工程</p>
<p>提問將來京　下水道工程，在中國還是新興的事業，修建材料，以水泥，河沙，碎石爲大宗，可說全是國貨。羅處長告訴記　一南京市政府亦成立了下水道工程處，重慶市工程處副處長張人雋升任該處處長，全部工程預算已訂為四千億元。毛理爾顧問在十一月間，將由美赴京協助設計。」(特派員歐關醉）</p>

<p>裁判樂秀榮。兪長鑾。薛豐登塲執法，熊貓先攻，梁友義一擊被接出局，友文上壘再度被殺，王慶瑞三次險球，亦告下壘，由於客軍張迺祥之投球幻變莫測。石炭進攻，熊貓梁友樂亦以銳利之球投擲，客軍郭復三首擊完成一壘，奈後繼者無法上壘，致首局完畢，各無所獲。第二局主隊梁友聲東山再起，一擊獲一壘，惟李啓滕被殺後接應乏人，徒勞無功，而客軍亦無分可得。第三局中，熊貓攻畢後，客軍會究成三壘打，然仍無分完畢。第四局再度接觸，熊貓王慶瑞出馬，首擊完成二壘打，繼又　土三壘，梁友義偸擊，王慶瑞完成全壘打，熊貓遂以一分領跑。省軍重振軍容，冀圖反攻，奈除主將負務外，同時軍心早現　亂，直至終塲，熊貓乃以實貴一分，險勝客軍，石遠征注初遭敗績。昨賽戰績如下：</p>

<h3>父子綱球賽　擴大決賽節目　今明秩序按原定舉行</h3>
<p>父子組網球雙打比賽，初有提早結束之議，昨經委員會正式決定，仍按原定秩序舉行，爰由顧乾麟委員提議，爲使此首次父子賽增加興趣，而使之更有意義起見，決賽時擬請宣司令鐵吾親臨給獎，並擬預定二千萬元目標拍賣義球，另再由各對父子推銷門券，俾親友一致蒞臨捧塲，全部收入，撥充社會公益義舉，如是則史無前例之父子網球賽，將爲網球界値得紀念之一頁，並予子弟費以良好之印象。當經張子震·胡筠　·胡憲生·侯大年等委員贊同，乃決定仍維持預定秩序，今明日各有半複賽兩塲，下星期六日兩天舉行複賽決賽，決賽日或將另排表演節目，以增興趣，今明日秩序如下：</p>
<p>侯大年侯開弟對馬惠弼馬景榮　今日三時半許</p>

<p>張子震張榮才對朱寬朱幼寬　明日四時半</p>
<p>今日四組實力均極平均，球藝水準相當高，不免有激烈競爭，惟朱敏堂右臂傷筋不能用力，連日延醫診療，爲維持神精起見，今日仍照常出塲。</p>
<p>昨日兩塲次賽，朱張兩對球藝平均，習練有素，故勝來均相當容易，成績如下：</p>
<p>父子賽迎日在綠燈會舉行，該會會員因之减少拍球機會，且該會每日必以茶點招待各對賽員，此種熟忱，不可多得，該會會長唐叔明並惠捐父子賽銀盃及獎章等，尤值得欽佩。</p>

<h3>甘省全運會繽紛錄　蘭市包辦冠軍　表演節目精彩</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州航訊〕甘省全運會中，自行車表演舉行兩次，是李壽山和李維石（後者只十四歲）同時表演，有單輸，雙輪，在車上表演種種驚人的按巧，如車上脫衣褲，喝茶，仰臥，俯臥，直立車上，雙人並騎，倒騎，　蜻蜓，以手代脚前進……等，花樣百出，態度瀟洒，會塲上幾萬人齊聲鼓掌，是大會最受歡迎的一個節目。</p>
<p>馬術表演</p>
<p>永登軍牧塲的馬術表演，只有十五騎參加，而且馬花色不一，先量　塲數匝，接着表演伏鞍，仰臥，橫臥，跳上跳下，　裏藏身，放　直立馬背，倒乘，……花樣好像很多，但空氣鬆弛，引不起觀衆的興趣，而看過西北蒙藏人士騎術的，益感有　壞之別。最後還是一位六六高齡的謝海天老先生，和西北日報女職員邵作祺小姐的騎馬賽跑，前者長袍馬褂，銀　飄飄，後者西洋女騎士裝，朱顏　　，在路道上輕跳縱地，真個「風馳電掣」，「宛若驚鴻」，倒博得全塲的掌聲。</p>
<p>自左起：孫訓會長汝楠，郭總裁判俊卿，萬米冠軍五思念，彭次長昭賢（宋炳林攝寄）</p>
<p>記者賽跑</p>
<p>最後要大書特書的，便是新聞記者的百米賽跑，這是大會進行到第三天，由記者們自行發起的臨時節目，當博得大會的讃許和重視，預賽時，參加的有十六人，分爲兩組。蘭州市長兼副會長孫汝楠和記者們打賭，假如達到十四秒時，市長請客，第一天預賽，兩組共取八人，第一是西北經濟日報武村，成績十四秒五，第二天決賽，由大會總裁判郭俊卿發施號令，孫市長記時，四週觀衆齊報以熱烈的堂聲，記者們放下手裏的鋼筆和拍紙簿，脫去大衣西服，有的選臨時借了跑鞋，一聲號槍，各記者均以跑新聞之競爭「脚」法，奔跑上前，觀衆高呼「加油」，越打氣越顯得窘態畢露，結果西北日報的吳文華，以十四秒四打破預賽紀錄，雖然未到十四秒的成績，但市長爲實踐諾言，並慰勞大家，在晚餐時加了幾個菜，而大會又臨時決定，　前四名每人發一面錦旗。</p>
<p>成果檢討</p>
<p>大會經過五天又半的時間，先後吸收將近二十五萬的男女觀衆，省縣市共消耗經費在四十億元以上。所得的成果，還差强人意。郭主席寄　在大會閉幕典禮中，檢討本屆大會的缺點是：　有的個人參加比賽項目太多，疲勞過度，影響成績，　有人對比賽規則，不盡明瞭，可見體育敎育尚欠普遍，同時以四點勗勉各選手：　珍視大會成果，　努力體育革命，　爭取全國榮譽，　充實建省學識。</p>
<p>這次比賽的總成績，除女高組田賽爲第九區奪得冠軍外，其餘第一名統由蘭州市包辦，所以蔣主席所頒「自强之基」的錦標，也爲蘭州市奪去了。</p>

<p>現棉回漲</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，由疲轉俏。外埠紗廠逢低扒吸，本街同業因紗價提高，人心又趨堅昂。價格一致飛揚，交易尚旺，成交數極零星。靈寶棧交價最高做開四三○萬，較上日挺十萬。</p>
<h3>華股中途氯盛　臨收復見頹廢</h3>
<p>華股昨仍呈恍惚，午堅而後疲。經委向政府提出改低證交證金之訊，以及業外黑市飛俏，午刻最見振作。惟借款消息，不絕如　，逢高仍遭脫手者所迫低。臨收復見頹廢，前途無一定目標，極爲不定。晨開永紗見三〇三元及三一五元後，中美借款，傳說忽盛，乃跌至即交二九七元遞交三○七元低價。塲外息價開低至二角二分半及二角七，形勢轉定。外股見倘，商務漲停板，金鈔黑市重躍，近午永紗再漲到三一一元及三二一元，而後以三一○元及三一九元之價收市。美亞等在大戶爭吸下，所漲更多。餘股除新亞不見振作外，亦均跟隨漲高。午後永紗曾升高至即交三一六元遞交三二五元高價，終以借款消息不絕如縷，逐步降低至即交三○三元及遞交三○六元低價，而後以三○四元及三○八元之價收市。除新亞等冷股外均被帶小，結果較晨收計即交股永紗中紡榮豐統益美亞中絲商務火柴新光景福勤興內衣中法新華華新微挫至半成弱不等，信和大通閘北各跌半成及半成强，火柴麗安恒豐尚平，信誼新亞微升。遞交股計信和美亞新光景福各低半成，餘均小挫。塲外各老股除銀行股及文化股尚秀外，餘均平定。</p>
<h3>統債外股均漲</h3>
<p>公債昨以報載有開鑄銀幣消息，又起漲風。統丙晨開一五三○○元，自一四六五○元升至一八四〇○元結束。六四四室買進，五五二室五○三室亦納，五五五室五五○則出。結給果較前收計甲乙升一千五，丙漲三千二，丁升一千二，戊好一千四，成交約四百餘萬。</p>

<h3>南菲洲布商　大量打購香港布</h3>
<p>總額一萬一千六百萬碼布廠須兩年半方可交齊</p>
<p>南菲洲經營布疋之公司，現向香港織布廠訂購數目驚人之布料，計共達一萬一千六百萬碼。以現時香港生產率估計，至少在兩年半內，所有出品完全不再運銷其他地區，始克應付。其中蘇丹方面，擬訂購之二千萬碼，係一還兩戴者，即每年供給二千萬碼。據廠商聯合會主席岑載華稱，其中南菲七千六百萬碼，餘為蘇丹方面訂購。以目前本港約三百家大小織布廠生產率計，每月出布疋十萬疋，一萬一千六百萬碼，約等於二百八十萬疋，以此計算，即兩年零六個月，方能完成。査上述擬訂購數自之一部份，計六千萬碼，係由香港工商業供應署通知廠商會者，餘爲洋行方面接洽者。査菲方某公司曾向日本査詢布價，但日方未能供應如許龐大數量之布料。記者曾詢問岑氏，假如此一大定單果能爲港廠所獲得，則原料可成問題否。據云若得工商業供應署之協助，相信不成間題，目前棉紗來源爲孟買，英國，加拿大及上海云。</p>

<h3>梅特林克的新作</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>梅特林克印行他的叢刊差不多巳有十年以上。他所印的是默想，日記，隨筆，偶然與到的詩句或寓言，戲劇的零碎塲面，隨時記下或從來記起的讀書摘句。現在的這一本「遙遠的偉大」（The　Great　Beyond）連托馬斯曼所敘述過的聖經故事也包括在裏面。</p>
<p>梅特林克以爲上帝和靈魂是不可知的。他的神秘主義至今不曾改變。他仍舊爭論着人與無限的關係。「老實說，一切這些問題有什麼用處呢？他們難道是閉着眼睛活着的麼？」梅特林克又說：「我們的肉眼不能看淸字宙的一切」。</p>
<p>像梅特林克這樣八十四歲的人，能够不憂傷，不想到死，這樣的嚴肅，這樣的不悲苦，可說是除了這位比利時的大師以外是很少見的。「靑島」（L　Oiseau　Bleu)的知慧，他仍舊不曾失去。這劇本四十年間曾風行歐美，至今不衰。</p>
<p>這本新作最後是一篇二十面的短劇「不想死的老人」(Theold　Man　Who　Does　Not　Want　to　Die)，彷彿歌聲吹送在風中，幾乎不容易聽見，但依舊和諧，一直到底。這是一篇美麗的作品。這篇短劇顯示，每個人帶着他的「影子」和死亡活着。一個人死的時候，他用不着懼怕上帝：他不會看到「他」，連影子也不會看到「他」，——因爲我們已經在「他」裏面了。</p>
<p>去年聖誕節前夜，梅特林克在弗羅里達(Florida)別墅的花園喪折斷了腿，不知現已恢復健康否。</p>
<p>在反納粹的戰爭期間，我們想到「靑島」上的話：「他們需要一個英雄，爲反對不義而戰。」他自己在一九一八年曾描繪德國進軍比利時，出了一本「史替爾孟德村長」（Le　Bourgmestre　de　Stilmonde)。他曾保衛他的家鄕，在一封信上說：「我來得太遲。明天早晨我要巡閱軍隊，我要擦亮我的毛瑟槍，那根槍實在是銹得可以了。」</p>
<p>梅特林克在一九三二年做了伯爵，他是近代比利時文學傑出的代表。他是一八六二年八月廿九日生於阿斯特克爾(Oostacker)村的。他是在聖巴布(Barbe)的基督教學院和根特(Ghent)大學受的教育。他在阿斯特克爾村別　中對於養蜂感到很大的興趣，於是在一九〇一年五月寫了一本有名的「蜜蜂的生活」。一九三〇年興趣轉移，別尋出路，又出版了「星的神秘」。他夏天有別墅在大寺裏，冬天有別　在尼斯。</p>
<p>二十四歲時他曾做過律師。一八九二年他出版了「潘萊士與梅里生」(Pelleas　and　Melisande），嘲笑根特工廠中冷血的人。他覺得他自己不配幹法律，一八八九年就停止了律師職務的執行。</p>
<p>他的家裏並不缺少錢，因比他可以專心致力於文藝工作。他開始寫詩，一八八九年印了一卷。最有趣的是他的戲劇「馬蘭公主」(La　Princess　Meleine）最初也是詩，後來纔完全重寫爲散文。他並不是立刻成名的，起初人家都不知這他，後來米爾波稱他爲「比利時的莎士比亞」，引了他的警句，他纔成爲國內人的談賣。他在一八九五年還譯過英國福德（Ford)的「可憐她是　淫婦」(Tls　pity　Shes　aWhore），改名爲「安娜蓓拉」（Annobella）。</p>
<p>一八九〇年布魯塞爾印了他兩個劇本，一八九一年他又出「七位公主」（Sept　Princesses），帶有强烈的神秘主義的傾向。「靑鳥」寫樵夫家中兒童們無結果的尋找了記憶之院，夜之王宮和幸福的花園，他們想替鄰家的病孩尋求幸福，不料幸福却整天地在家裏等待看他們。</p>
<p>他的人物大都像是夢中的境界，「幽靈假扮着人在世界漫遊」。　在巴黎住了一個時期的平房，認識了法國的不少象微派詩人。他的「潘萊士與梅里生」經Debussy改編爲歌劇，聲名更大。「愛格萊凡因與西來塞特」(Aglacaine　ot　Selysette)被稱為不可多見的感情與靈魂的冒險。</p>
<p>他的大寺別墅佔三十五畝，樹與草地，風景甚美，是十三世紀的建築。</p>
<p>他現在已不大相信命運了。他覺得人的意志是可以克服命運的。</p>
<h3>揚州夢</h3>
<p>— 陳汝衡</p>
<p>在申報春秋副刋上，常讀到十年不曾見面的老同學洪爲法式良兄的「揚州續夢」，在欣賞之餘，却引起我對於「揚州夢」研究的興趣。</p>
<p>原來唐人于鄴寫了一篇小說「揚州夢記」對於唐中書舍人杜收在揚州的風流軼事，有所渲染。杜牧當年曾賦詩有「十年」覺揚州夢，　得靑樓薄倖名」之句，頗引起後世文人的嚮往和憧憬，因此便也寫了若干傳奇小說，將杜牧故事格外强化起來。現在據我們所知所見，古今以「揚州夢」名稱做書名的便有以下六種。</p>
<p>喬夢符的「揚州夢」　此是元曲雜劇，演杜牧事，算是最早將揚州夢寫成戲劇的。</p>
<p>稽永仁的「揚州夢傳奇」　稽永仁是淸代無錫人，署抱犢山農，吳梅把這傳奇列入他的奢摩他室曲叢要。</p>
<p>黃石收的「夢揚州雜劇」　黃有「四才子」雜劇，「夢揚州」乃是四種之一，寫杜牧娶紫雲紅雨二妓事。其餘三種，便是「　輪袍」，「飲中仙」，「籃橋驛」。</p>
<p>不知名的「揚州夢傳奇」　這是淸人所撰，演的乃是杜子春事。杜子春是長安人，爲揚州巨商，後過老君得道，故事係根據太平廣記。可是我們僅僅在「曲海總目提要」裏，見到這傳奇故事的約略記載，有目無書，大概是無法覓到舊本了。</p>
<p>焦東周生的「揚州夢筆記」　焦東周生著書在淸代洪楊之亂以後，焦寞是鎭江所屬的鄉鎭，他因往來揚州，寫出了一些繁華旖旎的花叢掌故，和若干風雅的詩詞。書分四卷，爲　夢中人，　夢中語，　夢中事，　夢中情，文筆極爲雅馴，不愧名手。現由世界書局列入他們出版的「美化文學名著業刋」裏，有民國二十二年葆興子的叙云：「是編爲江南圖書館抄本，焦東周生所著。叙其一生花叢之經歷，燕朋狎友之唱和，揚俗之繁華，揚人之迷信，佚事遺文，悉　無遺，詩詞之膩艷，文筆之雋秀典雅，洵非近代小說家所可望其項背」云云。的實不是溢美之詞，書中文筆，實非淸末民初海上鴛鴦蝴蝶派文人所寫得出。</p>
<p>不署名的「揚州夢小說」　這是淸人所撰，寫揚州當乾隆時代繁華的情形，和社會上一些零碎記事。書中穿插着若干文人，而以鄭板橋爲中心人物。鄭板橋爲一代天才作家，，兼詩書畫三絕，他有印章一顆，爲「康熙秀才雍正舉人乾　進士」十二字。他雖生長在蘇北的興化縣，却常來揚州。書中所記，有任兩淮轉遝使的　雅雨，(書中作魯都轉)，袁子才，(作元子才)趙雲松，程午橋，金棕亭，及若干待考的詩人文士。書中並叙述名園的建築，如徐氏的別墅「靜照軒」，布景奇妙萬狀，中間有「水竹居」，就是方今的噴泉。水像　珠一般噴過屋，是中國當時建築已受西洋影響的明證。鄭板橋在書中却作陳晚橋，最可惜的是著書的人並未署名，舊本未見；民國四年由國學維持學排印問世，在今日已難覓得。我將另作長文介紹，這裏無須多說了。</p>
<h3>秋日抒情</h3>
<p>— 蕭冷</p>
<p>昨夜，我爲灰天的哭泣所驚醒，夜風輕叩着我的窗扉，說憂悒剛從西方旅行歸來，要踏進我記憶的小室裏來休息。我打開了窗，灰天的眼淚正滴瀝地淋落下來，有一稱奇異的低泣的聲音在遠方震蕩着；一張美麗而憂悒的少女的面龐浮現在窗外的黑暗裏……。</p>
<p>淸晨，我散步到湖濱去，潮濕的風從湖西吹來，飄落了法國梧桐的枯葉。那些不知名的野花憔悴地低着頭，花瓣上　滿了晶瑩的淚珠；沿湖一帶沒有一個行人，那些寂寞的遊艇零亂地繫在岸邊……。這景象是凄淸的，但更凄淸的還是我這悠遠的思念。</p>
<p>這整整的七年來，爲您的愛情，將在這些陰黯而無告的日子裏繁衍在我的心頭，如同秋日林問的野輩一樣，它開放得很茁壯而美麗，但沒有人注意到它，誰知道它是這樣孤寂地自生自滅了呢！我分明知道，這只能給我更深沉的苦痛，但，有時苦痛也是惹人眷戀的；因爲，這苦痛是那麼純淨而美麗得可愛。縱然這愛情的花朵沒有人來欣賞它，但我仍是珍惜它，像珍惜自己年靑的生命。</p>
<p>我是沒有辦法描述這可怕又奇怪的愛情是如何地深入到我生命的內部；它竟成爲我心靈的一部份，它以驚人的力量，吸取我的感情。它是一株大樹的樹根，而我的心靈是土地，我的感情是養料，照理，這株樹應該有碩大的花菓的，但是，因爲它沒有陽光的照耀，而終於憔悴了……。</p>
<p>這永遠是我生命中一個難言的悲哀。</p>
<p>我記起了那些我們一起度過的日子，那些冬夜的長談，與永生在記憶裏的淸淚與熱吻。……這些消逝了的靑春的日子呵，像是一串奇巧的珍珠，我一顆顆地點數着它們；細細地咀嚼着這些溫馨的記憶。</p>
<p>愛情之神呵！你是苛虐了一個對你始終是虔敬而忠誠的信徒了。</p>
<p>當我鄙棄了幸福而承受這份苦痛時，我的心是哀怨的，但我仍是誇傲於自己這份純淨的心情。</p>
<p>陰霾的天，不免有所感傷，我信筆將它們寫下來，作爲一個秋日的憂悒的記錄。</p>
<h3>作家論批評</h3>
<p>— 東方蒙霧</p>
<p>批評從來無論如何沒有影饗過我。特別是現代的批評不適於影響人，因爲批評家看書是很不細心，不會看而且常常不明白所看的書。當然，這不但只關於我的書，而是批評家一概的缺點。「初學的」靑年作家受他的害處是很不輕的。關於編輯人對於批評文章疎忽的態度，應當提一筆；大概編輯們也不細心讀它。至多只是一般的讀一讀而巳。</p>
<p>——高爾基</p>
<p>在作爲藝術家的這方面，人從沒有聽到設我對於人能够寫的論及我的文章作過最輕微的注意。</p>
<p>我像服爾泰一樣的思想：「幾下蒼蠅的針刺不足以牽住一匹在疾弛中的馬。」</p>
<p>說到這些　物，祗有讓他們講話。他們的餽舌一定不會使在何人不朽，也不會從阿玻龍使他不朽的人奪去他的不朽。</p>
<p>——悲多芬</p>
<p>批評家應該比思想家聰明而比藝術家有天才，但他不是創造者，而且也不積極，他是鐵面無情的。　——托爾斯泰</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「還有更淺薄的在後頭呢！」耀羣顰起了那雙改造過的眉峯；「他把我估計得稍爲底了一點，您瞧，在變方對證了一些無聊的口供之後，買沙夫這傢伙，居然當看那麼些人——僞警署的辦公人員和特工份子等等——要求那個僞長官讓它向外通一次電話。經過他們兩方面一審做作，那買沙夫使出了無數的怪身段，居然當塲打起電話來了……</p>
<p>「打給日本行動司令部？」我忍不住這麽猜着。</p>
<p>耀羣：「搗鬼罷啦，誰知道他打給誰，可倒是用的日本語言」</p>
<p>「您後來怎麽出來的呢？」我間。</p>
<p>「可眞榮耀哪！「大日本島軍駐津行動總司部」派遣好幾名衛隊，名是保衛，其實就是押解，把我弄到他們部裏。買沙夫還一路不斷的安慰我，胡說入道地替它自己宣傳了許多；說它在日本鬼子方面，怎樣有勢力，又說縱令那些日本軍部不給它帮這一下忙，它還有更大的力量，可以動用。反正毫無危險——指着我和它兩人的地位而說……」</p>
<p>耀羣說到這裏，又拿眼光從我這邊移到小老虎身上。我想他這時候已經回憶到小老虎在天津的經過。小老虎和我這一次見面，時間非常忽促。關於他在天津的工作，和怎樣經過北平又溜到了這裏的一點，也沒有對我提起過。幾次我想問他，都被他用話岔開了。這時我瞧見耀　對着小老虎瞧，並且臉上掛着神秘的微笑，我猜想其中一定有一種可笑的經過；正想對耀羣提出小老虎的事，耀羣早開開口說起來了：</p>
<p>「您知道，」耀羣　起了眉尖；「那像伙，買沙夫，把我弄到日本行動總部去了以後，直到昨天爲止，她就沒有讓我單獨做過一點事；好比一個鬼影子似的，一直釘在我的身後。固然有時候不同我在一起，可是我每次要想有所舉動，總被它事先佈置了一種防錢，圈禁了我的自由，所以說，無論他是否同我在一起，我都無法單獨行動。」</p>
<p>我有些不懂。像耀羣這麽一個厲害角色，何以竟被這買沙夫圈禁了起來？究竟還是專門使用詭計和陰謀，還是使用武力？所以我把這一點，特別向耀　探問。</p>
<p>「這是有些莫明其妙。」　羣有些恍惚似的：「只舉一個例，您大概就可以明白了。譬如說，在日本行動總司令部裏，每碰見一個人，無論是日本鬼子，或是咱們本國人，他總搶着給我介紹；介紹的時候，再三的讓人家注意我的面容和衣着。所以他雖說有時候自己去辦由己的事，我要是多走一步路，好像就有人在身後發出一種不三不四的隱語或聲響，讓我感覺到是一種警告，不得不停止當時的企圖。所以，可以說這幾天我簡直被他圈禁了！……</p>

<h3>U.S. is Studying Aid to China Plan; Rumor Wei's Report Has Been Approved; Military Advisory Group Organization Will Be Expanded</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] United Press had reason to believe on the 24th that U.S. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have approved Wedemeyer's report, advocating military and financial assistance to China. It is reported that they are currently studying the best way to implement this plan, namely, expanding the military advisory group stationed in China and granting loans to China. It is rumored that they are looking for a suitable American military officer to lead this plan. It is generally believed that Wedemeyer's report is largely similar to the Pulit Aid China theory published in "Life" magazine, but with slight differences in details. According to reports, Pulit advocated lending China US$1.3 billion in loans within three years, plus direct military assistance. As for the reasons why the United States has temporarily delayed the issuance of a statement based on the Wedemeyer report and the implementation of a new policy towards China, it is still unknown here. It is generally believed that the main reason is that Truman and his advisors are still considering the best strategy to implement this plan. The reasons under consideration include: How to extend the President's emergency administrative power regarding the U.S. military advisory group. The U.S. military advisory group stationed in China was established based on emergency wartime powers and has not been approved by Congress. If the military advisory group is expanded to the scope advocated by Wedemeyer, it must be approved by Congress. Before the entire plan is presented to Congress, whether economic assistance should be provided immediately based on the regulations of the Export-Import Bank, or it is better to wait for the congressional debate. Regarding the issue of publishing the aid to China plan, publishing the aid to China plan at this time will inevitably delay the implementation of Marshall's aid to Europe plan. Although the scope of the advisory group advocated by Wedemeyer has not been disclosed, it is generally believed that the advisory group will definitely be expanded. The current military group has only more than 400 people.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] U.S. Congressman Judd arrived in Ping by plane from Korea at 1:40 p.m. on the 24th. At 3 p.m., personnel from the U.S. consulate held a meeting to listen to intelligence regarding North China. He planned to visit Li Zongren and various military and political leaders in Ping on the 24th. He will stay in Ping for five or six days. Judd said that he had been in China for many years and had a fixed Chinese name, and immediately wrote "Zhou Yide" in Chinese. According to reports, he has always advocated actively assisting the Chinese government and has repeatedly criticized the CCP. As early as 1939, he wrote an article in the Sunday Weekly criticizing that U.S. aid to China only accounted for 30% of global aid, and half of it was occupied by the CCP. He also said that the Communist Party was a secret weapon for the Japanese invasion of China.</p>
<h3>Issue of Minting Silver Coins; China and Mexico Have Not Yet Made Concrete Contact; Mexican Ambassador to China and Consultant Young Are Both in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Foreign Deputy Minister Ye Gongchao commented on the Mexican Minister of Finance's statement that "Mexico may soon be minting silver coins for China," saying that there have been no negotiations between China and Mexico on this matter, and the Chinese government has not formally inquired with Mexico about the possibility of this agreement. When reporters asked, "Is the Chinese government interested in studying the possibility of this matter?" Ye replied: We have studied this matter before and understand the consequences of adopting silver coins. At the same time, banking circles in Shanghai stated that the Chinese government had studied this matter several months ago, and since then the Chinese government has planned to seek a loan of US$346 million in American silver. It is said that "silver coins" have become a "topic not to be mentioned" in China, because if China adopts a silver standard, it will lose its membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the Mexican Minister of Finance announced that our government would ask Mexico to mint silver coins on its behalf, reporters inquired with financial authorities. According to the reply, since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government has found it difficult to supply auxiliary coins in the future due to the enemy dismantling the Shanghai Mint's machinery. It has repeatedly inquired with various countries about their minting capabilities and whether they can mint coins on its behalf. However, there is no need to mint coins until the time is ripe for currency reform, and there is no concrete contact at present.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mexican Ambassador to China, Yisque Dai, and his only secretary have been in Shanghai for two weeks and have not yet returned to Nanjing. Their visit to Shanghai may be related to the currency system issue. It is also learned that Consultant Young is also in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Currency System Must Be Reformed Before the End of This Year; Financial Authorities Have Proposed a Plan</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] People here regard the news of China and Mexico conducting coin minting negotiations with great attention. It is generally believed that this may be a strong sign that we will resume the use of silver coins. When people familiar with finance discuss this matter, most believe that currency reform is not entirely impossible. It is reported that the financial authorities had submitted a proposed plan several months ago, and judging from the current situation, the currency seems to have to be reformed before the end of this year. Although the silver standard is not necessarily a progressive system, since foreign countries have a large supply of silver, it may not be a bad transitional measure. As for minting and other tasks, our country is not entirely unprepared.</p>
<h3>Opinions of People in the Financial Sector on Silver Coins; Believe That It May Create Local Stability</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the Mexican Minister of Finance announced that Mexico would mint silver coins for our country, reporters specially visited people in the financial sector to summarize their opinions: They believe that if this news is indeed true, it must be linked to the Sino-U.S. loan. Because purely relying on our country's existing silver reserves is definitely not enough. It was previously rumored that the United States would provide our country with a portion of its silver reserves as part of a loan to reform the currency system, which may be the matter. It has been widely rumored in financial circles recently that the United States will lend China US$1.5 billion, which is confirmed by the remarks of senior U.S. diplomatic personnel. There must be a reason for the rumors. In the future, after the issuance of silver coins, the existing legal tender will inevitably become auxiliary coins. If there is no regulation on the ratio between the main and auxiliary coins, the phenomenon of bad money driving out good money will inevitably occur in the market. Therefore, it is inferred that a ratio will inevitably be stipulated between silver dollars and legal tender, and the government will do its best to stabilize it. As for the impact of the issuance of silver dollars on our country's economy, opinions in the financial sector vary, but most believe that it may create local stability. Because hard currency has intrinsic value and is supported by international loans, it can increase people's confidence in the government. At the same time, based on observations of our country's monetary history over the past 30 years, this move can at least localize price fluctuations.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Establishes Equipment General Depot to Handle Japanese Reparations Materials; Private Sector Portion Will Be Shipped to China Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The private sector portion of industrial materials Japan is compensating to our country, totaling 120,000 tons, can be shipped to China next month. The country is divided into three ports for unloading: Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, which are then transferred to North China, Central China, and South China, respectively. It is estimated that about 60,000 tons will land through the port of Shanghai. The first batch to arrive in Shanghai is about 10,000 tons, mainly tools and machinery. In order to handle this batch of materials, the Industrial and Commercial Counseling Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established a General Equipment Depot, which, in addition to storing and distributing the compensated materials for the private sector, will also handle the industrial and mining materials jointly transported to China. The list of the first batch of compensation materials is currently unknown. After arrival, they will be stored in the United Nations General Warehouse and other newly built warehouses, and then experts will evaluate them and sell them to private factories at a certain discount. If there is a complete set of factory equipment that cannot be sold separately and the price is too high for a single factory to purchase, a joint factory will be organized, jointly operated by a large number of factories with similar nature.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Passes Revised Publication Law in Provisional Meeting; Relaxes the Scale of Publication and Distribution</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] The revised publication law, which was previously drafted internally, was passed by the Executive Yuan at its 12th provisional meeting on the 24th, and will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete legislative procedures. Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng recently spoke to reporters about the main points of the revised publication law, which lies in relaxing the scale of distribution and publication, while simplifying application registration procedures. In other words, it also encourages publication and the development of cultural undertakings. According to the original registration method, the registration application must be copied to the Central Propaganda Department for registration before it can be sent to the Ministry of Interior for issuing a registration certificate. At the same time, the time limit is also stipulated as 28 days, but now it is changed to "within ten days," the time is shortened, and it is not necessary to go through the registration of the Central Propaganda Department. It only needs to be approved by the local competent government, and then reported to the Ministry of Interior for issuing a registration certificate, so the procedures are simple and the agency is simple. (See this newspaper on the 22nd of the month) The following are divided into reports and discussion items of the provisional meeting (Continued on page two, column one)</p>

<h3>Cross-Party Members on National Assembly List to Have Candidacy Revoked; Review Work to Be Expedited</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu of the Kuomintang (KMT) convened a small group meeting with representatives from the Min and Qing parties on the morning of the 24th to discuss how to handle the issue of cross-party members participating in the election. It was found that some of the National Assembly candidates proposed by the Min and Qing parties were, upon KMT review, discovered to be KMT members. This clearly made them cross-party members. While the KMT expressed support for friendly parties, this did not apply to cross-party members. This point was raised during the meeting on the 24th to solicit opinions from the Min and Qing parties. Representatives from the two parties stated that if the evidence was accurate and they were indeed cross-party members, the two parties would withdraw the originally nominated candidates and nominate others. It was decided in the meeting that the KMT would list these names and send copies to the Min and Qing parties, who would then convene their respective Central Standing Committees to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Kuomintang has already sent the list of all cross-party members among the National Assembly candidates of the Min and Qing parties to the two parties. It is reported that the number of these cross-party members accounts for slightly less than two-fifths of the total list for the Democratic Socialist Party and slightly more than two-fifths of the total list for the Youth Party. The Youth Party has a total of 470 nominees, of whom about 200 are cross-party members.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to regulations, the list of National Assembly candidates should be announced nationwide fifteen days before the National Assembly election (i.e., November 6th). The lists nominated by political parties were originally scheduled to be submitted to the Election Headquarters for notification before the 25th of this month so that these lists and orders could reach the relevant units before the 6th. However, the lists nominated by political parties are still under review, and the deadline has arrived. Therefore, the KMT Central Standing Committee and the Central Election Steering Committee held a joint meeting on the 24th to discuss the issue of review time. It was decided to divide the review work into seven groups to expedite completion. Based on the current situation, even if the seven groups hold continuous meetings simultaneously, it will still take five days to complete. Therefore, the Election Headquarters is quite anxious about the notification work. A person in charge reportedly said that if it is impossible to complete the work in time, not only will the list not be announced as scheduled, but the voting will inevitably be affected. The meeting on the 24th also passed the list for Guangxi Province and the lists of professional representatives for Zhejiang Province and Tianjin. An interim Central Standing Committee meeting will be held on the morning of the 25th to approve the lists of each review group, after which the group reviews will commence immediately.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The list of National Assembly candidates from free professional organizations has not yet been submitted to the review committee for review, but a decision has already been made during the small group review. It is reported that in order to achieve the goal of selecting the virtuous and capable and ensuring equitable distribution, the Election Committee intends to convene another small group meeting to re-review the journalists' section.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Eleven legislators, including Liu Guanshiun, gathered again on the morning of the 24th to discuss the nomination of legislators and paid a visit to President Sun Fo and Vice President Ju Zheng to make some presentations. In addition, a seven-member group from the Control Yuan also held a meeting on the morning of the 24th.</p>

<h3>Commemorating Taiwan Retrocession Day</h3>
<p>Today is Taiwan Retrocession Day. In the history of the Republic of China, this is a day worthy of joy and celebration. In order to attract people from other provinces and foreign countries to visit Taiwan, thereby promoting social and economic prosperity, cultural exchange, and mutual understanding, the people's organizations of Taiwan Province have launched a month-long campaign involving all sectors of Taiwan to celebrate Retrocession Day. The Taiwan Provincial Government will hold a grand celebration today, and President Zhang Qun and the British parliamentary delegation will also visit Taiwan one after another to participate. Today's Taiwan is a time of great gatherings and celebrations by all the people. We would like to express our sincere and boundless excitement, wishing the Taiwanese compatriots happiness, the success of Taiwan's construction, and predicting that Taiwan's future will be glorious with the light of retrocession!</p>
<p>Taiwan is a province of our country, located between the East China Sea and the South China Sea, shaped like a banana leaf, encompassing the main island, the Penghu Islands, the Nansha Islands, and other islands, and is collectively referred to as Taiwan Province. It faces the Pacific Ocean to the east, is separated from Fujian by the Taiwan Strait to the west, is adjacent to the Ryukyu Islands to the northeast, and is adjacent to the Philippines across the Bashi Channel to the south. The entire territory is strategically important, the land is fertile, and the products are abundant. The total area is approximately 35,961 square kilometers, with a population of approximately six million. The history of Taiwan is a history of struggle full of disasters and hardships for our compatriots. The hard-working and persevering Taiwanese people, after several generations of hardships, finally gained and entered the light on October 25, 1945. Recalling the painful past of the Taiwan Incident, the scene is still vivid in our minds. Considering the past struggles of the Taiwanese people, we are all the more delighted with the arrival of this festive season.</p>
<p>Due to the importance of Taiwan's strategic location, it unfortunately suffered foreign interference. In the 32nd year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1604 AD), the Dutch first occupied Penghu and then occupied Taiwan proper. In 1626, the Spanish invaded Taiwan. In the 21st year of the Daoguang reign (1841), the British had covetous intentions. In the 9th year of the Guangxu reign (1883), French troops also spied on Taiwan. Although these multiple invasions were crushed, they already hinted that Taiwan had been drawn into the vortex of world politics in the competition among imperialists. Japan coveted Taiwan, and there were minor intrusions in the mid-Ming Dynasty. It effectively occupied Taiwan after occupying the Ryukyu Islands (1st year of Guangxu, 1875). After the Qing government was defeated in the Sino-Japanese War, Japan occupied Taiwan after signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki on March 23 of the 21st year of Guangxu. It was exclusively ruled by Japan for 50 years. On this day two years ago, the Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, General Ando Rikichi, signed the surrender document to our government. Since then, Taiwan has regained its light, broken free from foreign shackles, and returned to the embrace of the motherland. This is the hard-won harvest of our country's eight-year war of resistance against Japan, and also the success of the Taiwanese people's long-standing struggle.</p>
<p>Foreigners coveted Taiwan's strategic location and its rich resources, causing many disasters in Taiwan's history. The Chinese nation never forgot Taiwan. In every era of disaster, it struggled for the freedom of Taiwan. This shows that China is unified and the Chinese nation is a whole. When the Dutch ruled Taiwan for 37 years, Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan. Zheng Jing, Chenggong's son, built and managed Taiwan, and his glory is recorded in history. After Zheng Jing's death, his son Ke Shuang ruined 23 years of glorious history, but then came the restoration movements of Taiwanese people such as Zhu Yigui and Lin Shuangwen. When the Treaty of Shimonoseki ceded Taiwan, the Taiwanese people declared independence under the leadership of patriot Qiu Fengjia. Although this independence movement was defeated by the Japanese army, the nation's righteousness illuminates the heaven and earth, penetrates the sun and moon, and is immortal, forever illuminating Taiwan. The Japanese ruled Taiwan for 50 years, filled with half a century of blood and tears. The Taiwanese people never succumbed. In his book "The Sorrow of the Taiwanese People," Nichiiri Sanchuan exposed Japan's fifty years of harsh rule and revealed the history of the Taiwanese people's tragic struggle. The revolutionary movement led by the founding father Sun Yat-sen aimed to liberate Taiwan; the anti-Japanese judgment led by President Chiang Kai-shek, and the retrocession of Taiwan on October 25, 1945, its meaning truly fulfilled the struggles of Zheng Chenggong, Qiu Fengjia, and Liu Yongfu, and achieved the goal of liberating the Taiwanese people.</p>
<p>From the above, we can know how great is the meaning of Taiwan's retrocession! Today's Taiwan has become a province of China, its politics are moving towards democracy, its economy is moving towards construction, and its future prospects are limitless. Today, as we commemorate Taiwan's retrocession, we deeply feel the value of retrocession. We hope that the six million people of Taiwan and the local government will cherish the historical value of retrocession, unite as one, and work together to create and build. The Taiwanese people regard Taiwan as the "garden of China." We hope that Taiwan can bloom with splendid flowers and be built into a paradise of the Three Principles of the People. The Taiwanese people's many years of suffering and the bitterness they have experienced throughout the generations should be rewarded with happiness and well-being! May the Taiwanese people and the local government work together to build a new Taiwan after today!</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun's Remarks in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Government Determined to Improve the Lives of Taiwanese Compatriots</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Premier Zhang Qun met with reporters at 3 p.m. on the 24th and delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of Taiwan's economic position and the government's determination to improve the economic lives of Taiwanese compatriots. He stated: "During Chairman Wei's recent visit to Nanjing, we discussed several concrete solutions regarding stabilizing Taiwan's financial situation, securing its economic life, and encouraging exports. The Taiwan dollar system will be maintained and will not change before the overall currency reform. Although Taiwan's coal is not of particularly high quality, it can supplement the current coal shortage in Shanghai, Nanjing, and South China if it is transported inland. The price of inland coal is fixed due to government controls. I will consider the issue of exporting products from Taiwan after investigating here. Taiwan has many products available for export, such as sugar, which was said to have an annual output of 1.4 million tons during the Japanese occupation. Other products, such as salt and camphor, can also be exported to foreign countries in exchange for foreign exchange and the machinery and fertilizers that Taiwan needs." Regarding the handling of Japanese territories, Zhang emphasized that Japan should return the territories it seized from China by force, such as the Ryukyu Islands, which should be returned to China's territory. Zhang also stated when meeting with representatives of central government agencies stationed in Taiwan today: "Starting from January next year, the salaries of civil servants will be readjusted based on the cost of living index in various regions. The salary issue of the central government agencies stationed in Taiwan is a technical one that will be discussed and resolved after returning to Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Cash Shortage in Jinan</h3>
<p>Check Discounting Phenomenon Occurs</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 24th] Recently, due to the fact that most of the cash has flowed into the newly recovered areas, the market lacks chips. Most banks and money houses use checks instead of cash, resulting in a check discounting phenomenon of 5% to 8%. The reporter specially visited Director Yin Wenjing of the Shandong Finance Department for this. According to him, this phenomenon is purely caused by the lack of cash at the Central Bank. The Provincial Government has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and Governor Zhang of the Central Bank to give priority to the allocation and transportation of banknotes. At the same time, it has also requested the Ministry of Finance to set up branches in Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places as soon as possible.

<p>[United Press, Korla, Xinjiang, 24th] The Ili side is demanding complete independence and is preparing to fight for it by force. The area has a population of 750,000, with the capital Korla, also known as Ili or Yining, 60 miles from the Soviet border. Several key figures in the independence movement were born or educated in the Soviet Union. Some of the people of Ili claim to be Soviet citizens. The people of Ili rebelled against Chinese rule in 1946, after which a fragile peace agreement was established, with the Chinese central government making various concessions but not allowing their autonomy. The people of Ili largely ignored this treaty and continued to strengthen their military. The negotiations in Dihua have come to a standstill. Song Xilian, the garrison commander of Dihua, has about 10,000 troops. A United Press reporter obtained permission from the Ili leader, Akhmetjan, to visit. Akhmetjan granted me freedom to travel throughout the region. Revolutionaries declared: "After the autumn harvest, major events will happen." Most people hinted that they distrusted the Soviet Union, but generally expressed indignation towards the Chinese people, believing that "Russians are better than Chinese." The Ili leaders oppose the temporary joint government organized by Dihua. They currently claim to have 50,000 troops, including many excellent cavalry, commanded by Zhang Sak, who was born in the Soviet Union. Key figures in Ili firmly believe that once the opportunity is ripe, the revolutionary army will easily launch a decisive attack. The Chinese government can only reinforce Dihua by air or by the 1,300-mile winding desert land route. The reporter personally saw six twin-engine Soviet bombers parked at an airport near Korla. Ili soldiers said: "We have neither pilots nor ground service personnel. These planes were purchased by China from the Soviet Union in 1939 and captured during the Ili revolution." It can already satisfy the separatists. Ordinary people insist that separation from China must be completed. The reporter spoke with some battlefield nurses and female cavalry. Many of them wore short socks, lipstick, and nail polish. They wore blue-gray uniforms, red and yellow epaulets, navy blue short skirts, and eyebrow-covering hats. He Fusa Fu said: "We are fighting for independence." Korla has about 4,000 Chinese residents, who have been tricked into slums by people of other ethnic groups and appear frustrated. A Soviet woman said: "The Chinese used to think we were inferior. Now they have been put in their proper place."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] The Herald Tribune commented on the Nanjing government's report on the rebellion in Xinjiang Province, saying that although the people of Xinjiang Province have become increasingly inclined towards the Soviet Union, making it more difficult for the Chinese government there, China is still allowing the province broad autonomy and conducting negotiations through the capable General Zhang Zhizhong, which is a wise and generous measure.</p>

<h3>President Truman Announces Special Session of Congress to Address European Aid and Domestic Inflation Simultaneously; Cabinet Passes Emergency Aid Plan for Europe</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 24th Broadcasting: Washington news, President Truman drafted today a radio report to the country, explaining the "urgent reasons" for convening a special session of Congress on November 17. It is reported that the purpose of convening this special session is to provide $1 billion in emergency aid to Europe and to prevent "alarming" domestic inflation. This report is scheduled to be released at 3:00 PM Standard Time on Saturday. Government officials expect the report to provide a detailed analysis of the urgent economic situation at home and abroad.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] President Truman today requested that a special session of Congress be convened on November 17 to address the urgent need for foreign aid. In announcing this decision, the President explained that legislative action was necessary to address the crisis in Western Europe. Several European countries have exhausted their economic resources and will not be able to purchase coal and food this winter. He said that the crisis in Europe was so urgent that he could not wait until January to seek legislative approval. The President announced the convening of the special session of Congress at his press conference after meeting with eleven congressional leaders from both parties. He said that the Congress would also pay attention to the situation of rising domestic prices. The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives have scheduled discussions on foreign aid matters for November 10, and it is expected that the State Department will provide basic facts about the need for emergency aid at that time.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] According to reliable sources, when President Truman convenes the special session of Congress next month, he will request Congress to provide $650 million to help France and Italy in the period before March 31, as the Marshall Plan is expected to be implemented after March 31. This figure may change in the next three weeks. Regarding this temporary relief plan from October 1 to March 31, both houses of Congress must complete all actions before Christmas.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] All members of the U.S. Cabinet, at the call of President Truman, held a plenary meeting at the White House on the 23rd and passed the President's temporary aid plan for Europe. Only Secretary of State Marshall did not attend the meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Several officials who are very concerned about the European aid plan said that a special session of Congress is about to be convened, but they are deeply afraid that the price issue will overwhelm the European aid issue. The United States is approaching the eve of a general election, and politically, curbing prices is far more concerned by the people than aiding Europe. Well-informed sources pointed out that rapid aid to Europe will increase the Democratic Party's and Truman's political capital, which is disliked by the Republican-dominated Congress.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Peace Conference Can Only Be Held Next Year; Sino-U.S. Differences Await Negotiation; The Key Lies in the Veto Power Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt believes that there is no opportunity to convene a preliminary peace conference with Japan at present, and it is only hoped that it will be held at the beginning of next year. However, he hopes that by the beginning of next year, the differences between China, the United States, and the Soviet Union on procedures can be fully eliminated so that the conference can proceed smoothly. Evatt said that the United States is formally studying the request made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie during his visit to Washington. China believes that the draft of the Japanese peace treaty drafted by the United States has not fully restricted Japan's industrial potential and has not fully strictly regulated the control of Japan after the conclusion of the treaty. Regarding the issue of controlling Japan after the conclusion of the treaty, China insists that the U.S. civilian rule viewpoint is not sufficient to effectively prevent the reconstruction of Japan's war economy. However, it is learned that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang firmly believes that the U.S. proposal to control Japan by restricting imports will be carried out satisfactorily. All the delegations of various countries here hope that China will finally abandon its consistent position with the Soviet Union, that is, the drafting of the treaty should not use the veto power, and any of the four major powers in Asia can use the veto power to prevent clauses that they do not welcome. In addition, the main point where China and the United States have failed to reach an agreement is the number of merchant ships Japan has after the treaty is concluded. The United States' view is that Japanese merchant ships should be between 2 and 3 million tons. This view is completely rejected by China. China firmly believes that half of this number is sufficient for Japan. However, according to well-informed sources, this issue may be resolved after the peace conference is convened, because China and the United States are currently too far apart to coordinate. As for whether the Soviet Union agrees to participate in the eleven-nation conference without using the veto power, there has been no indication so far. However, authoritative sources said that if the United States can get China to comply, it will proceed with the treaty regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates.</p>

<h3>Cripps Emphasizes Dollar Panic; Announces New Savings Measures; Says Britain's Concessions to the U.S. Have Reached Their Limit</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Economic Minister Sir Stafford Cripps made his first speech in the House of Commons today after taking office, emphasizing that the lack of U.S. dollars is still the central problem facing Britain today. The key to Britain's entire problem lies in restoring the balance of foreign trade, especially trade with the dollar area. Cripps, when referring to the tariff negotiations in Geneva, said that the success of the negotiations is already in sight. The reduction of U.S. tariffs has permanent benefits for us, so we should reduce our tariffs and agree with the autonomous territories to limit or reduce the imperial trade preference system in exchange for U.S. concessions. We have conducted sentencing with the U.S. in accordance with the principles of fair trade, and the concessions we have made have indeed reached the edge of reasonable concessions. Cripps then announced several other emergency measures, such as the sugar ration will be reduced from ten ounces per week to eight ounces, the bacon ration will be one ounce per week, the fresh meat ration will be one shilling per week, the British order for tobacco from the U.S. will be completely stopped, the import of raw materials that must be paid in U.S. dollars will be further reduced by £20 million, and the finished products imported from the U.S., including machinery, etc., will be subject to strict licensing system. Cripps estimated that after the implementation of these austerity measures, Britain's dollar trade deficit this year should not exceed £250 million. The main spokesperson for today's conservative was former Education Minister Butler, who said: The government has obviously handled the British economic and financial situation improperly, and the government's proposal to reduce the rights of the House of Lords is just another measure to divert the attention of the people from the economic situation.</p>
<h3>North Korean Troops Keep a Close Watch</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 24th] A Korean official who fled from North Korea to South Korea last month said that when the U.S. and Soviet occupation forces withdraw, the 270,000 troops trained and equipped by the Soviet Union in North Korea, including the Chinese Communist Eighth Route Army, will immediately occupy the entire country and make it the 18th republic of the Soviet Union Federation.

<h3>Iranian Parliament Passes Single-Clause Bill Declaring Iranian-Soviet Oil Agreement Invalid; Opposition Party Moves to Impeach Prime Minister Sultanah</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 24th] The oil agreement signed by Iranian Prime Minister Sultanah and the Soviet Union in April last year was declared invalid by the Parliament yesterday by a vote of 102 to 2. The Prime Minister protested that no matter what the Parliament decides, we are still a friendly country of the Soviet Union and hope to maintain good political and economic relations with the Soviet Union in the future.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 23rd] Iranian Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Senator Shafa Gao said that according to the "single-clause" bill passed by the Parliament, the concession of oil to foreign countries or the joint venture of oil companies with foreign capital will be prohibited. Also, after Iranian Prime Minister Sultanah reported to the Parliament yesterday on the process of negotiating the oil agreement with the Soviet Union, the opposition party immediately filed a motion to impeach Sultanah. The Parliament decided to postpone the discussion of the impeachment case. According to Shafa, this single-clause bill can protect Iran's rights under the oil concession to Britain and stipulates that if abundant oil reserves are discovered in northern Iran within the next five years, the Iranian government may negotiate with the Soviet Union to sell oil to the Soviet Union. The content of the single-clause bill is expected to be announced tomorrow.</p>
<h3>British Government Reduces Naval Strength; Churchill Sternly Questions; Alexander Responds That Adequate Strength Is Still Maintained</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Opposition leader Churchill accused the Labor government, especially Defense Minister Alexander, of seriously mishandling Britain's combat military strength in the House of Commons. He demanded that the government publish a white paper announcing the number and form of naval warships in active service. When Alexander refused, Churchill declared that the government had a tradition of providing such information in times of emergency, and he believed that the present was an emergency. Churchill, who had served as Navy Minister in both world wars, pointed out that the reduction of the domestic fleet has seriously damaged Britain's interests around the world. The Navy has 170,000 officers and soldiers and an annual budget of £180 million. Why can't it maintain an appropriate fleet? Although the status of the Air Force has been improved, the Royal Navy is still the firm guarantee of the British Isles and the British Empire in the minds of the people. Alexander explained that the reduction of the domestic fleet was due to the reduction of naval personnel from 178,000 to 147,000 by the end of February next year, and after the return of naval servicemen serving abroad, people must be sent to supplement them, so the domestic fleet had to be reduced. Churchill then asked the Defense Minister to explain the existing strength of the domestic fleet. Alexander replied that when the re-establishment order was promulgated, the domestic fleet had one battleship, five cruisers, and twelve destroyers; at present, it has one cruiser and four destroyers. He also revealed that the British Mediterranean Fleet still maintains adequate strength.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing Finance and Reforming Administration; The French Cabinet Plans to Launch a New Plan; Ramadier Will Request a Vote of Confidence from Parliament</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Ramadier declared yesterday that the policies adopted by Gao Le and the Communist Party would all plunge France into chaos and destruction. According to his , Ramadier will submit a new list of cabinet members to the special meeting of Parliament and request a vote of confidence. The special meeting is scheduled to be convened next Tuesday, but must first undergo two days of debate, and then vote on Thursday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The Ramadier "pocket" cabinet, which was established yesterday afternoon, will submit a plan to Parliament next Tuesday to stabilize finance and reform the administration. Ramadier said at a press conference yesterday that domestic policies will not change due to changes in the cabinet, but only intends to concentrate power during the current difficult period. It is generally expected that the new cabinet is only an "emergency" measure and will not last long. When Ramadier outlined the government's policies, he put forward the following points: The amount of raw materials is already equal to that before the war, but in order to ensure the easy import of raw materials, the output must be 140% to 150% of that before the war. Before the Marshall Plan is implemented, France must engage in a difficult economic battle at home. In terms of finance, the state's revenue and expenditure must be balanced in 1948. If inflation is avoided, the related wage-price problem must be resolved and strictly adhered to. In terms of politics, France's current political atmosphere is full of electricity. The French people are loyal to the parliamentary system based on universal elections. Anyone who attempts to destroy this system is acting against the state.</p>

<h3>Defending the Palestine Defense Line; Iraq Calls for Jihad; Jinnah Supports the Arab Position</h3>

According to Dulles, he had called for the organization of moral forces "to strive for peace rather than win by war." Austin indirectly accused the Soviet Union of "possibly being the worst seller of war."</p>

However, if the distributing agencies have other stipulated conditions, and the aforementioned registered companies, factories, or businesses do not meet those conditions, they still may not distribute. When factories or businesses distributing goods allotted by the government or state-owned enterprises apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration, in addition to those that have been in operation for more than two years and have supporting documents, they should have two registered businesses in the same industry provide written certification that they are legitimate businesses (if they are factories, they should also prove that they have manufacturing equipment) and guarantee that they will not engage in speculation or profiteering. The Social Affairs Bureau may also dispatch personnel to conduct on-site investigations when necessary. If the aforementioned factories or businesses distributing goods allotted by the government or state-owned enterprises are engaged in two or more types of business and are legally required to join the corresponding industry association, it is limited to cases where the business they are engaged in is closely related to their original business, and the relevant industry associations may specify this in detail in their industry regulations and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval before implementation. If any of the following occurs after the aforementioned factories or businesses begin distribution, the distributing agency should revoke their right to distribute, and at the same time, state the facts and notify the Social Affairs Bureau to consider the seriousness of the circumstances and suspend their business for a certain period of time or revoke their registration. If the circumstances are serious, the matter should be referred to the court for handling in accordance with the law.

Failing to allocate (all or part of) the goods that should be converted to allocation, with the aim of concealing them for profit or selling them at high prices. Failing to reproduce (all or part of) the goods that should be reproduced, and hoarding them for profit or selling them at high prices. Otherwise disposing of the allocated goods arbitrarily, not in accordance with the original intention of the allocating agency. Industry associations have the responsibility to report to the Social Affairs Bureau if they discover that any members of the industry have engaged in the above-mentioned acts.</p>

<h3>Remaining Enemy and Puppet Properties' Auction Still Faces Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to relevant sources: The handling of enemy property is proceeding very smoothly. Taking enemy and puppet factories as an example, among the Class A factories, only the Aikou No. 1 Factory is still being auctioned. This factory specializes in manufacturing textile machinery and currently has 200 workers. As for the Class B factories that are in a state of suspension, most of them have also been sold. In the early stages of the cleanup of enemy and puppet industries, the purchasers were only people from the rear, and local people mostly lacked confidence in this type of factory. Today, due to the shortage of materials, the prices of any equipment in each factory are very high. Therefore, the situation has changed from the past, and whenever enemy and puppet factories are auctioned, the purchasers are very enthusiastic. Currently, the majority of the remaining enemy and puppet properties are real estate. Although the government has decided in principle to auction them off, there are still many difficulties due to the tenants and other reasons.</p>

Jewish Treason Case Retried Yesterday</p>
<h3>Jewish Treason Case Retried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of the Jewish man Robert Thopanylick, accused of treason, was previously sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the High Court. Pan refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court for retrial, which was remanded for retrial. The court opened at 3:00 PM yesterday. Pan was accused of lobbying Jews to vote for the Japanese in the election of directors of the Public Concession Bureau in 1940. Later, he cooperated with the Japanese Consul Shibata to inspect secret documents of the British Consulate and broadcast on the radio, propagating for the enemy and obstructing the publication of anti-Japanese Jewish publications. He also established a secret agency in Room 126 of the Cathay Hotel to collect intelligence for the enemy. Pan denied all the accusations, only admitting that he was responsible for the affairs of the Jewish Refugee Committee, which had a Japanese supervisor. The witness, a Jewish girl named Yifan Agneson, testified that she had worked as a typist in Pan's office and had seen many Japanese people in Pan's office on the third floor of the Sassoon House. She claimed not to know anything else. The court adjourned for a retrial on a later date, and the defendant remained on bail.</p>

<h3>School Principal's "Confession": For Debt or Adultery?</h3>
<p>Further Trial of Jiang Ruzhen's Case; Ba長 and Others Testify, Recounting the Mediation Process</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The case of Jiang Ruzhen, the principal of Huade Elementary School, being accused of raping two 13-year-old female students of the school, Zhu Yuexian and Zhang Juying, was further tried in the Criminal Court No. 1 of the District Court yesterday morning by Judge Meng Tingke. First, Zhu Yuexian recounted the experience of being victimized. Then, the witness Zhu Changbao was summoned. Zhu testified: "I am from Changzhou, 28 years old, living at No. 4, Lane 40, Xiaotaoyuan Street. I run a funeral supplies business and am the second landlord of Zhu H茂珠. I don't know Jiang Ruzhen, nor do I know about the adultery. On May 31, I returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou. Two days later, Ba長 鄭元清 came to find me, asking my wife to take him to see Zhu H茂珠 to mediate on behalf of Jiang Ruzhen." Zheng Yuanqing, the security chief of the 25th 保, Xicang Road, testified: "Jiang and I are old friends of many years. On the 6th, Jiang came to find me and we went to the City God Temple for tea. He said he had a misunderstanding with a female student in the school because of a loan matter, and asked me to</p>
<p>intervene in the mediation</p>
<p>. I immediately invited Mrs. Zhu Changbin to discuss it with Zhu H茂珠. Zhu said that it could only be resolved if Jiang himself went to talk. I once said: turn big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems; let everyone forgive each other and it will be over." Mrs. Zhu said: "On June 4, I reported it to the Penglai Police Sub-bureau. On June 5, Zheng Yuanqing came. I immediately proposed three conditions that Jiang must agree to: 1) Publish an apology in the newspaper; 2) Write a letter of repentance; 3) Provide a letter of responsibility, guaranteeing that the boy's family will have nothing to say after Zhu Yuexian grows up and gets married. Zheng said the</p>
<p>conditions were too harsh</p>
<p>. After consultation, I agreed to only require Jiang to write a letter of repentance. Zheng then showed me the letter of repentance written by Jiang. In the letter, Jiang wrote, "I (Jiang referring to himself) often took Zhu Yuexian to play at the City God Temple, causing misunderstandings. I am very sorry, please forgive me." The court questioned Jiang Ruzhen about whether he admitted to the crimes he committed. Jiang testified: "On June 1, I went to find Ba長 Zheng to ask him to mediate. In the afternoon, I went to Jiangyin. The letter of repentance was written on May 29. The apology was for the</p>
<p>misunderstanding that occurred</p>
<p>because of the loan." Judge Meng immediately questioned, "You are the creditor, and Zhu H茂珠 is the debtor. Why are you apologizing to her instead?" Jiang thought for a moment and replied, "Because she hired gangsters to intimidate me." Jiang's wife, Mrs. Feng, testified that after Zheng Yuanqing brought back the letter of repentance and gave it to her, she threw it away and could not find it. The court determined that the case still needed further investigation and rescheduled the trial. As they were about to adjourn, Jiang suddenly said again, "Writing the letter of repentance was actually to explain that I often took female students to play at the City God Temple." It is heard that during the next trial, they will try to summon a long-time tailor shop acquaintance to testify.</p>

<p>Regarding the implementation of regulations to restrict private automobiles in this city, the municipal government has drafted regulations in accordance with central laws and regulations, which will be implemented after approval by the Municipal Council. The content of the draft is as follows: (A) Regulations for the restriction of private automobiles: rationing, reduction, and fuel allocation must be implemented simultaneously. Private individuals importing vehicles from abroad will only be approved under the following circumstances: (1) Those who are qualified to use automobiles according to the regulations on the restriction of the use of automobiles by private individuals issued by the Executive Yuan, such as doctors, banks, industrial and mining enterprises, news agencies, etc. (2) Those who have already shipped the vehicles before December 1, 36, and have proof. (3) Those who guarantee that they will not resell the vehicles in this city within one year of import. The above three items will be reviewed and approved by a review committee organized by the Transportation Management Committee, the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and other relevant agencies, and licenses will be issued. Any private individual or private legal entity that already holds an automobile license, if they exchange their old car for a new car, will be allowed to correct the original license registration and issue a new license. Business passenger cars and business freight cars, according to the regulations on the restriction of automobile transportation businesses, each business establishment that has registered and obtained a license before August 31 of this year, or has paid and ordered and already shipped the vehicles, will be allowed to use them, and must register uniformly before November 15, and licenses will be re-issued after strict investigation.</p>
<p>Vehicles from Other Cities</p>
<p>(B) Vehicles licensed in other cities entering this city will be handled according to the following regulations: (1) Those that entered this city before October 14 of this year, have registered as usual, and paid taxes, will be handled in the same way as those originally registered in this city. (2) Vehicles passing through temporarily will be issued fuel purchase certificates for the month after registering and paying taxes as usual, limited to one time. (3) Automobiles from other cities that are permanently stationed in this city should have their gasoline allocation transferred from the local competent authority to this city, and then licenses and fuel allocation certificates will be issued. (C) Private or private legal entity automobiles not subject to quota restrictions: Fire trucks and ambulances of private fire brigades, ambulances of private hospitals, commercial buses and long-distance buses, oil tankers of Standard Oil Company, engineering material vehicles of commercial public utility companies, etc., if they add new vehicles, will be issued licenses by the relevant competent authorities after review.</p>
<p>Government Vehicles</p>
<p>(D) Regulations for the issuance of licenses for government vehicles: (1) Central administrative agencies and state-owned enterprises in Shanghai must provide formal letters and telegrams from the central competent department or committee to apply for new vehicle licenses, but mail delivery vehicles and telegram delivery vehicles only need formal certification from the Shanghai postal and telecommunications authorities. (2) Branch offices or communication offices of central or local military and political agencies stationed in Shanghai applying for registration and issuance of new licenses must be approved by the Executive Yuan before they can be issued. (3) Municipal buses and municipal bureaus and offices that need to add vehicles must be approved by the mayor. (4) Vehicles specially approved for allocation, distribution, or delivery by the Executive Yuan will be licensed by the Public Works Bureau. (5) Vehicles of the UNRRA, the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, and the consulates of various countries in China will be licensed according to preferential measures. (6) Military vehicle licenses of the National Army will be handled by the Ministry of National Defense, and military vehicles of the U.S. and British armies will be licensed by the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government is Ordered to Handle the Economical Use of Vehicles by Agencies</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has also received instructions from the Executive Yuan regarding various points on restricting the use of automobiles: (1) All agencies should reduce the number of automobiles and fuel consumption as much as possible, and should report the average monthly fuel consumption for this year, and then reduce at least 10% from the original amount. (2) Automobiles of all agencies should be centrally managed. Except for the heads and deputy heads who may use one automobile each, all other automobiles should be for the common use of the agency. (3) The allocation of automobiles of all agencies should be limited to official needs. The number of shuttle buses for transporting employees should be reduced.</p>
<p>Existing Vehicles</p>
<p>All agencies should report the types, quantities, horsepower, and number of staff members of their existing automobiles to the Executive Yuan for record. The Municipal Government is currently processing the order, but because the original order of the Executive Yuan only instructed to economize on the use of government vehicles and did not impose restrictions, it is feared that new automobiles and confiscated automobiles will appear in disguise under the name of government vehicles, and the gasoline quota will not be able to meet the demand. Therefore, it is planned to request the Executive Yuan to impose restrictions on agencies as well.</p>
<p>Two Points Requested by the Municipal Government</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Government is currently requesting instructions from the Executive Yuan on two points: (1) Whether the transfer of sales and purchases of automobiles by those qualified to use automobiles, government agencies, and private automobiles that do not meet the regulations should be allowed. (2) For automobiles that applied for registration before October 14, but the licenses were not issued due to incomplete documents at the time, or complete documents requiring inspection, can they be allowed to issue licenses and transfer ownership after the documents are supplemented or the inspection is passed.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Bureau of Telecommunications, in order to strengthen the management of the national broadcasting industry, stipulated that only ten frequencies are allowed for use by radio stations in this city. Among them, the frequencies used by private radio stations shall not exceed half of the prescribed number, and the nine private radio stations in this city, namely Gospel, Greater China, Mainland, Yuanchang, Oriental, America, Huamei, Heming, and Linji, were ordered to merge into five. Except for the Gospel Radio Station, which is allowed to share a frequency with the United Radio Station, the remaining eight stations share two frequencies and broadcast in rotation every other day. The eight radio stations, including Greater China, have encountered great difficulties in their business due to the limitation of frequencies, and have repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to demand the same treatment as other radio stations in this city, with two stations sharing one frequency, but this has not been approved. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications approved two new radio stations in this city, Xinyun (880 kHz) and Damei (760 kHz), each to use one frequency exclusively. The eight private radio stations deeply feel that the treatment is unfair, and yesterday they jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Council, requesting that justice be upheld so that the private radio stations can obtain equal treatment. The original petition also included a statistical table of radio stations in this city. According to the table, there are currently 47 radio stations broadcasting in this city, including Public Construction, Far East, United, Damei, China Free, Jindou, Military Friends, General Land Force, Xinyun, Shanghai, Huguang, America Linji, Greater China, Mainland, Qing Sheng, Peace, Military Voice, Expedition, Tie Feng, Oriental, Huamei, Yuanchang, Heming, Fu Qing, Municipal Police, United, Gospel, Huguo Army, Asia One, Cooperation, News, New Su, Minsheng, Ninety-nine, Victory, Zhongjian, Tiansheng, Xin Sheng, Greater China, Xin Du, Xin Hu, Datong, Shanghai, Jiancheng, Chinese Culture, and Youth, etc. The actual frequencies used range from 600 to 1400, totaling 33. Among the radio stations broadcasting, only 22 have been formally approved by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, including China Free, Jindou, America Linji, Greater China, Mainland, Oriental, Huamei, Yuanchang, Heming, United, One Gospel, Asia, Cooperation, Minsheng, Ninety-nine, Xin Sheng, Greater China, Xin Hu, Datong, Jiancheng, and Chinese Culture.</p>
<h3>Xiang Sheng Hotel Arrests Two Criminals; Extensive Involvement in Arms Trafficking</h3>
<p>[News from Dongshe] The Third Investigation Brigade of the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters recently cracked an arms trafficking case, which is very extensive and is currently under strict investigation. It is reported that the Brigade Commander Zhang Hanguang received a secret report a week ago, learning that there was a secret organization selling arms in a certain place in Jiangwan, and the person in charge was an active-duty military officer. He immediately secretly dispatched officers to investigate, and disguised themselves as customers to negotiate a purchase. After investigation, it was confirmed that there were a large number of LeShu revolvers and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. He then sent personnel disguised again to negotiate a purchase, stating that each revolver was 3.2 million, and agreed to meet at the Xiang Sheng Hotel on Albert Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Brigade Commander Zhang ordered Brigade Deputy Yan Zi to lead seven officers to make arrangements as scheduled, with Brigade Deputy Yan disguised as a customer. At about 3:00 PM, two soldiers carrying three revolvers arrived slowly. Deputy Brigade Commander Yan waited until the money and goods were exchanged, and after the two soldiers left with the money, the officers lurking around swarmed out and arrested them. According to their confession, one was Zhang Guo应, and the other was Qiu Zhen万, who were ordered to come to negotiate. They were immediately taken to the Garrison Headquarters for strict interrogation. However, the case involves a wide range, and the Garrison Headquarters is conducting a strict investigation.</p>

<h3>Arbitration Ruling of Silk Weaving Factory Dispute Delivered</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Three-quarters of the silk weaving factories in the Hudong district have not yet resumed production. The Labor-Capital Appraisal Committee delivered the arbitration ruling of the 14th meeting to both labor and capital of the silk weaving industry yesterday, ordering them to comply. However, it is learned that the capital side still expresses dissent to the appraisal's ruling and will request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association to convene a general membership meeting, believing that the regulations of the appraisal are very unreasonable. If the silk weaving factories accept them, once a precedent is set, the future troubles of other industries will be endless. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, the appraisal of the appraisal committee is extremely fair. The wages of workers in May, June, July, and August have not been settled by the factories. The losses suffered by workers in these four months due to the decline in currency value should be compensated. Therefore, adding one yuan to the basic salary, the capital side has no reason to object.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Retrocession Day: A Bright Outlook</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taipei 22nd Airmail] As this article is being published, the reporter imagines that it should be the second anniversary of Taiwan's retrocession. The 6.3 million Taiwanese compatriots and the advance troops who arrived in Taiwan have all witnessed and personally experienced the moving and tearful great enthusiasm at the time of the retrocession on October 25 two years ago. However, we have the right to say that we hope that the days to come will show more brightness! Unfold greater brightness in suffering! The first impression of travelers who come to this land (Mr. Peng Xuepei is one of them) is invariably beautiful and pleasant. The wide roads dotted with betel nut trees sway with slender figures in the warm subtropical breeze. Sparse people walk leisurely, and the scenery with a South Seas and Japanese flavor makes people from Beijing and Shanghai no longer feel the fiery breath and fleshy stench. A kind of superficial stability makes one aware that this is indeed a happy land. Yes, Taiwan has a more stable environment than the mainland, has island sentiments, has a more basic construction, and has a progressive expression of balanced cultural development... However, if you stay here for a long time, anyone will feel the monotonous, dry, and oppressive weight. Taiwan is, after all, a small island, a small world. Once sea and air traffic is cut off, there is almost the possibility of suffocating the islanders.</p>
<p>Taking Over Enemy Property From the ruins, we took over the island and a legacy left behind by the Japanese after thirty years of hard work. Taking the Japanese assets alone, the book value is already over 55.6 billion, and this is only limited to the assets taken over in the province. The assets taken over by the central government agencies are not included. We also took over the Japanese factories, mines, enterprises, and all transportation tools. In the past two years, we have witnessed the restoration of most of the factories from the ruins, the reconstruction of difficult projects, the repair of river embankments, and the operation of the latest models of automobiles on the highways. In some places, the achievements have surpassed the heyday of Japan. Here are young people, technical workers, and researchers who are truly working hard and willing to learn. They only ask to be able to do something for Taiwan in a state of warmth and contentment, and to silently do more. Let the facts prove that we can accept this legacy. Although there are some fake "experts" among them, and even more so some corrupt people who are dreaming of making a fortune.</p>
<p>Perfect Policies Chairman Wei came to Taiwan, and the first step was to raise the exchange rate. The Taiwan dollar has not yet encountered a fate of decline. He accepted the opinions of the public, and in order to relieve the hardship of those who have lost their schooling and employment, he also reached out to welcome foreign investment. The Taiwan dollar has been adjusted three times in the past six months, and it is very likely to be adjusted again recently. Although the "adjustment" and "節" of materials have not been seen, it may be more effective in curbing the soaring prices. However, people expect the authorities to implement sound policies in a planned manner. Taiwan's economic breakwater is fragile. Production and marketing enterprises and institutions cannot be allowed to take care of themselves alone, nor can they be allowed to linger on their last breath. It is impossible for them to develop or destroy themselves separately. They must be closely coordinated to become a complete production system, echoing each other. Otherwise, the pace will be disordered and the methods will fail.</p>
<p>Optimistic Future Taiwan is not China's "granary." In terms of the large-scale supply of chemical fertilizers and the acquisition of foreign exchange, it can be understood that the central government places Shanghai first and Taiwan second. The central government attaches importance to Taiwan, and the people of Taiwan and the workers today should endure suffering and cherish Taiwan even more. There is no reason to be pessimistic about Taiwan's future. When the chairman personally supported the island province at the retrocession commemoration last year, he almost shed tears in his speech to the people after the recovery. This year, Director Zhang and Mr. Weng Wenhao will also come to attend the grand ceremony. What people sigh about is certainly the changes in personnel in the past two years, but the greater hope will be how to overcome the difficulties in financial construction and production in the face of the third year of retrocession. As long as the country has a way, Taiwan will always have a future. I hope that the people of Taiwan will recognize themselves and the world, because this was originally earned by the blood and heads of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians over eight years.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 20th Day] Taiwan has now become the only tourist area in the entire country.

The Provincial Government and related parties are both nervous and troubled about the arrangements for welcoming and sending off guests, as well as for food, lodging, and transportation.

Furthermore, the new cars of various government agencies are all subject to requisition. In addition to paying a sum of entertainment expenses, the Provincial Government finds it difficult to cope, and the county and city mayors feel particularly overwhelmed.

<h3>Land Dispute Between Two Clans: A Large-Scale Armed Clash Occurs in Yongtai, Rumored to Be Related to Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 21st Day] Mobilizing more than 3,000 people for a dispute over ancestral land and engaging in a large-scale armed clash, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, has caused a relatively large disturbance in the usually stable Fujian province. This bloody incident occurred in Houpingping, Longmen Village, Yongtai County, eastern Fujian, a place known for its simple and kind customs. The cause was a dispute over the ownership of a piece of barren land, which has been in litigation for several years. The plaintiff, Lin Shiyong, the clan head of the Lin clan, and others claimed that the land was the site of lectures given by their ancestor, the Neo-Confucian scholar Lin Yu of the Southern Song Dynasty. Due to years of disrepair, the houses collapsed, leaving only a piece of flat land as a historical site, which was occupied by the Lin clan. The defendant, Wang Jiaxiang, the representative of the Wang clan, and others claimed that the site of Lin Yu's lectures was at the foot of Fuding Peak in Yunfeng Township, 32nd Du, of the county, where Zhu Kao-ting inscribed the words "Longmen" on a stone, as documented in the county gazette. The Lin clan's descendants are scattered throughout various counties.</p>
<p>False Information Spreads</p>
<p>The Wang clan, which has lived in Longmen Village for generations, claims the village is the site of their ancestor's lectures. The plaintiff initially sued in the county judicial office and then appealed to the Fujian High Court, but both cases were dismissed. Wang clan members believed that the land rights had been determined by the court, which ruled that the plaintiff's claim was unreasonable, as the land in question had no identifiable boundaries. Therefore, the land should remain the property of the Wang clan. With clear land rights, they began constructing an ancestral hall on the land a few months ago. The Lin and Wang clans live in close proximity, and the Lin clan harbored resentment upon seeing this. The Yongtai Lin clan is known as a prominent family, with members scattered throughout the eastern Fujian counties of Linsen, Minqing, and Gutian, numbering quite a few. As early as a few months ago, the Lin clan had been brewing plans to</p>
<p>Settle the Score</p>
<p>with the Wang clan. This matter finally erupted on the 13th of this month. On that day, the Lin clan mobilized more than 3,000 clan members, some carrying hoes and others carrying guns, and converged on Longmen Village, Yongtai County, from various townships in Minqing and Gutian, with great momentum. The Wang clan, with fewer members, was unable to resist. The village was eventually captured by the Lin clan's army. Several Wang clan members were killed or injured, and 25 people were abducted and taken to Minqing. The rest fled. The Lin army took advantage of the victory, destroying more than a dozen houses and stealing over 300 ancestral properties from the Wang clan. Later, the county government dispatched troops to</p>
<p>Suppress the Uprising</p>
<p>and arrested more than 100 Lin clan members on the spot, bringing the incident to an end. Afterwards, it was said that three former Yongtai bandits, including Lin Xianmei, participated in the armed clash. The guns carried by the Lin clan members were mostly borrowed from the township offices in various townships. This was tantamount to condoning banditry, and the fact that the township offices provided weapons was tantamount to fueling the unrest. The provincial authorities and various sectors expressed extreme concern. The security authorities also reported yesterday that the Lin clan was</p>
<p>Brewing a Second Clash</p>
<p>The provincial government has now dispatched Inspector Huang Naifei to Yongtai to coordinate with local parties and mediate to prevent the situation from escalating again. As for why the land dispute between the two clans, which has been going on for a long time, erupted at this time, there is much speculation. According to the reporter's investigation, it is not unrelated to the elections. According to reports, Lin Dong, the clan head of the Lin clan, is currently running for National Assembly representative in the county. It is said that Lin specifically orchestrated this dispute to gather clan members to support Lin's election. Others say that Lin's opposing candidate used this dispute to incriminate Lin and undermine Lin's reputation. (Reported by reporter Chen Zhengyu)</p>
<h3>Faculty and Staff of Wuxi Normal School Take an Hour of Leave to Protest the Dismissal Incident at Suzhou High School</h3>

<h3>One of Chongqing's Great Constructions: The Sewer Project</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd Day (Airmail)] Sewers are a fundamental construction of a city. Eighty years ago, Paris, France spent 35 million U.S. dollars to build 75 miles of trunk lines and support 650 miles. Boston, USA, as early as fifty years ago, spent 15 million U.S. dollars to build 125 miles of trunk lines and 1,200 miles of branch lines. However, Chongqing, the wartime capital far in the southwest, only spent 1,548,782,000 yuan in June 1947 to build the first phase of 20.906 kilometers of sewer pipe project.</p>
<p>Expert Morrill</p>
<p>In January 1945, the U.S. State Department sent a sanitary engineering expert, A.B. Morrill, to Chongqing. This 60-year-old army colonel suggested to the highest authorities that if Chongqing had a perfect sewer system, it could reduce the mortality rate by 10% each year and would never have a flood disaster again. (Morrill did not lie: Chongqing did not have cholera this summer.) Morrill is an engineer worthy of respect. All the Chongqing people know that this foreigner had been to dark sewers for reconnaissance. He did not take a penny from the Chinese government, but his assistance in the design of the sewer project reduced the cost by 1 billion yuan. He is intelligent, humble, and does not insist on his own ideas. When Director Luo Jingzhong believed that it was more appropriate to build two ditches on both sides of the street than one in the center of the road in China, Morrill nodded and said, "OK."</p>
<p>Growth of Luo Jingzhong</p>
<p>Although Chongqing had begun the construction of ditches in the Qianlong period, a large-scale and systematic sewer design based on the principles of hydraulics did not begin until October 1946. At the beginning, millions of Chongqing citizens did not understand the importance of sewers. Director Luo, with his Ph.D. from the University of Louvain in Belgium, has a special style. He trained a group of cadres to persuade the people, and the construction office did not start work until the residents automatically requested to move. A total of 80 houses were demolished, and 400,000 people were mobilized.</p>
<p>Estimation of Rainfall</p>
<p>In Chongqing, constructing a sewer project is more convenient than in other cities because of the large slope. However, the disadvantage is that the topography of the city is not accurate, and the old ditch line records are incomplete. After the establishment of the Sewer Project Office, it took only four months to draw detailed maps of the city and plan line measurements by district. The most difficult thing was the prediction of rainfall cycles. If the rainfall is estimated incorrectly: if the ditches are too large, the project is wasted; if the ditches are too small, they are easy to flood. The rainfall record table of the Beibei Central Meteorological Research Institute only has records from 1941 to 1942, which is not enough for application. Therefore, the main reliance is still on the rainfall records of the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai. [According to the book "Chinese Land Use Statistics" by J.L. Buck, an American professor of agricultural economics at the University of Jinling: the largest average monthly rainfall in Shanghai is 188 mm, and in Chongqing it is 181 mm. As for the maximum rainfall in 24 hours, it is 200 mm in Shanghai and 208 mm in Chongqing.]</p>
<p>Discharge of Sewage</p>
<p>The function of sewers is to discharge sewage and rainwater. If the sewer project is completed in sequence, but the citizens still follow the old habits and dump accumulated waste everywhere, even with a good sewer, it will not help the cleaning and hygiene of the whole city. In view of this, the project office has planned to build 40 public toilets in the second phase of the project, cancel the septic tanks in the public toilets, and directly connect the feces to the ditches with tile pipes. In addition, the project office will contract the sewage connection for private residences. It is said that 2,000 residents have requested connection, and the project</p>
<p>Will Come to Nanjing in the Future</p>
<p>Sewer projects are still an emerging business in China. Cement, river sand, and gravel are the main construction materials, which can be said to be all domestic products. Director Luo told the reporter that the Nanjing Municipal Government has also established a Sewer Project Office. Zhang Renjun, the deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Project Office, has been promoted to director of that office. The total project budget has been set at 400 billion yuan. Consultant Morrill will go to Nanjing from the United States in November to assist in the design." (Special Correspondent Ouyang Zui)</p>

<h3>On the Debate of the Ten-Year Education Plan, Hu Shih Expresses His Thoughts, Believing the Government Should Especially Subsidize Excellent Departments</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Dr. Hu Shih, President of Peking University, has arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing after attending the Council of the Academia Sinica and completing official business with the Ministry of Education. He is staying at the International Hotel and plans to fly back north within a few days. Since Mr. Hu met with our newspaper's reporter in Shanghai on September 5th and first announced his suggestion to the authorities for a "Ten-Year Plan to Strive for Academic Independence," scholars, celebrities, and university presidents have successively expressed their opinions, launching the academic community's first major debate after the war. The enthusiasm has been rare in recent years, and as of now, this debate has not yet ended. Last night, our reporter visited Mr. Hu at the International Hotel to inquire about his thoughts on this matter. Mr. Hu replied that this dispute is merely due to differences in individuals' views and opinions. Mr. Hu did not deny "favoritism" regarding the five universities he proposed to develop first in his ten-year education plan. When asked by the reporter how to determine the standard for excellent schools, he did not elaborate, stating that it should be determined based on the school's talent, equipment, and past performance. He expressed agreement with the point that the government should provide special subsidies to excellent departments of various universities, but believes that it should not be regarded as an opportunity for "extortion." Next, in response to the reporter's inquiry about the current lack of equipment in various universities and whether educational funding might be increased to 15% as stipulated after the implementation of the constitution to improve the situation universally, Mr. Hu believes that it "can definitely be realized." He stated that the Council has formally suggested to the government that one-fifth of the 15% educational funding should be used for scientific research equipment, and the remaining four-fifths should be used for general cultural education. Finally, Mr. Hu told the reporter his thoughts on the recent arrest of Peking University students: Students should strive to learn during their studies, and revolution is not impossible, but since they are prepared for revolution, they must be prepared to be arrested and take responsibility for all their actions. At this point, Mr. Hu cited an example: After he previously published a piece about General Feng Yuxiang wasting foreign exchange in the United States, and the relevant parties made a correction, he immediately issued a statement admitting his mistake.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Battle of the Expeditionary Baseball Team: Shítàn Loses to the Panda Team; The 41st Inning Determines the Outcome; Re-Match Scheduled for Next Week</h3>
<p>The Shítàn baseball expeditionary team played its fourth match in Shanghai against the Panda team, the champion of the municipal softball league, at four o'clock yesterday afternoon. An estimated two thousand fans came to the field to admire the skills of both teams, which was even more lively than the first match. After the two sides presented each other with team flags, the competition began. Xuě Yǒngshùn, the main player of the visiting team, played with an injury. The Panda team performed brilliantly. As a result of the competition, the Panda team narrowly defeated Shítàn by a score of one to zero. After the game, the Panda team hosted the visiting team with refreshments at the Dōnghuá Sports Association. During the meeting, in order to further explore baseball skills, Shítàn specifically requested the Panda team to hold another practice match after the visiting team returns to Shanghai from Beijing. The home team agreed. Therefore, in addition to the battle against the Hùxīng team tomorrow, the final battle will be around next Thursday.</p>
<p>The referees were Lè Xiùróng, Yú Chángluán, and Xuě Fēngdēng. The Panda team attacked first. Liáng Yǒuyì was caught out on the first hit. Yǒuwén was on base and killed again. Wáng Qìngruì had three dangerous balls and also went out. Due to the unpredictable pitches of the visiting team's Zhāng Nǎixiáng, Shítàn's attack was met with Liáng Yǒulè's sharp pitches, and the visiting team's Guō Fùsān completed first base on the first hit. However, the successors were unable to get on base, and the first inning ended without any score. In the second inning, the home team's Liáng Yǒushēng made a comeback and gained first base on the first hit. However, after Lǐ Qǐténg was killed, there was a lack of follow-up, so the effort was futile, and the visiting team also did not score. In the third inning, after the Panda team finished attacking, the visiting team would eventually hit a triple, but still did not score. In the fourth inning, the Panda team's Wáng Qìngruì stepped up and completed a double on the first hit, and then advanced to third base. Liáng Yǒuyì stole a hit, and Wáng Qìngruì completed a home run, so the Panda team took the lead with one point. The provincial army regrouped, hoping to counterattack, but in addition to the main general being injured, the morale of the army had already appeared disorganized. Until the end of the game, the Panda team narrowly defeated the visiting team with a hard-won point, and Shítàn's expedition suffered its first defeat. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:</p>

<h3>Father-Son Netball Tournament Expanded Finals Program: Today's and Tomorrow's Order Held as Originally Scheduled</h3>
<p>There were initial discussions about ending the father-son doubles tennis tournament early. Yesterday, the committee officially decided to hold it as originally scheduled. Committee member Gu Qianlin proposed that to increase interest in this first father-son tournament and make it more meaningful, it is planned to invite Commander Xuan Tie Wu to present the awards at the finals, and to auction off charity balls with a target of 20 million yuan. In addition, each pair of fathers and sons will promote ticket sales so that relatives and friends can come to support the event. All proceeds will be allocated to social welfare causes. If this is done, the unprecedented father-son tennis tournament will be a memorable page in the tennis world and will give the children a good impression. The committee members Zhang Zizhen, Hu Yun, Hu Xiansheng, and Hou Danian all agreed, so it was decided to maintain the scheduled order. There will be two semi-final matches each today and tomorrow, and the quarter-finals and finals will be held on Saturday and Sunday of next week. A performance program may be arranged on the final day to increase interest. The order for today and tomorrow is as follows:</p>
<p>Hóu Dànián and Hóu Kāidì vs. Mǎ Huìbì and Mǎ Jǐngróng - 3:30 PM today</p>
<p>Chóng Zhì and Xǔ Péizhī vs. Zhū Bìtáng and Zhū Xiányù - 4:30 PM today</p>
<p>Gù Qiánlín and Gù Jiāzhèn vs. Hú Yún and Hú Qíchāo - 3:30 PM tomorrow</p>
<p>Zhāng Zǐzhèn and Zhāng Róngcái vs. Zhū Kuān and Zhū Yòukuān - 4:30 PM tomorrow</p>
<p>Today's four groups are all very evenly matched, and the level of skill is quite high, so there will inevitably be fierce competition. However, Zhu Mintang's right arm is injured and he cannot exert force. He has been seeking medical treatment for several days. To maintain his spirit, he will still play as usual today.</p>
<p>In yesterday's two second-round matches, the Zhu and Zhang pairs had average skills and were well-trained, so they won quite easily. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>The father-son tournament is being held at the Green Light Club, which has reduced the opportunity for members to hit balls. Moreover, the club provides tea and refreshments for each pair of players every day. This kind of cordiality is rare. Tang Shuming, the president of the club, has also donated silver cups and medals for the father-son tournament, which is especially admirable.</p>

<h3>A Colorful Record of the Gansu Provincial Games: Lanzhou Takes All Championships, and Performances are Wonderful</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Lanzhou] In the Gansu Provincial Games, bicycle performances were held twice. Li Shoushan and Li Weishi (the latter is only 14 years old) performed at the same time, with single turns, double wheels, and various amazing skills on the bicycle, such as taking off clothes and pants on the bicycle, drinking tea, lying on the back, lying face down, standing upright on the bicycle, riding side by side with two people, riding backwards, dragonflies, advancing with hands instead of feet... There were many tricks, and the attitude was unrestrained. Tens of thousands of people in the audience applauded in unison, making it one of the most popular programs of the Games.</p>
<p>Equestrian Performance</p>
<p>Only fifteen riders participated in the equestrian performance of the Yongdeng Military Pasture, and the colors of the horses were uneven. First, they measured the field several times, followed by performances of saddle down, lying on the back, lying sideways, jumping up and down, hiding inside, releasing and standing upright on the horse's back, riding backwards, ... There seemed to be many tricks, but the atmosphere was relaxed, which did not arouse the interest of the audience. Those who have seen the horsemanship of the Northwest Mongolian and Tibetan people feel the difference between good and bad. Finally, Mr. Xie Haitian, an old gentleman of sixty-six years old, and Ms. Shao Zuoqi, a female staff member of the Northwest Daily, had a horse race. The former wore a long robe and mandarin jacket, with silver hair fluttering, while the latter wore Western female equestrian attire, with a ruddy complexion. They lightly jumped on the road, truly "fast as the wind and lightning," and "like a startled swan," which won applause from the whole audience.</p>
<p>From the left: President of the association Sun Xun Hui Nan, Chief Judge Guo Jun Qing, Wan Mi Champion Wu Si Nian, Vice Minister Peng Zhao Xian (Song Binglin sent picture)</p>
<p>Reporter Race</p>
<p>Finally, the most important thing to write about is the 100-meter race of news reporters. This was a temporary program initiated by the reporters themselves on the third day of the Games, which won the approval and attention of the Games. During the preliminary round, sixteen people participated, divided into two groups. Sun Runan, the mayor of Lanzhou and vice president of the Games, bet with the reporters that if they reached 14 seconds, the mayor would treat them. On the first day of the preliminary round, a total of eight people were selected from the two groups. The first was Wu Cun from the Northwest Economic Daily, with a result of 14.5 seconds. On the second day of the final, Guo Junqing, the chief judge of the Games, issued the command. Mayor Sun timed the race, and the audience around cheered enthusiastically. The reporters put down their pens and notebooks, took off their coats and suits, and some temporarily borrowed running shoes. With the sound of the starting gun, the reporters all ran forward with the competitive "foot" method of running news. The audience shouted "Go!", and the more they cheered, the more embarrassed they became. As a result, Wu Wenhua from the Northwest Daily broke the preliminary round record with 14.4 seconds. Although they did not reach the result of 14 seconds, the mayor added a few dishes at dinner to fulfill his promise and reward everyone. The Games also temporarily decided to issue a banner to each of the top four.</p>
<p>Review of Results</p>
<p>The Games lasted for five and a half days and attracted nearly 250,000 male and female spectators. The province, counties, and cities consumed more than 4 billion yuan in expenses. The results obtained were still barely satisfactory. Chairman Guo Ji Qi reviewed the shortcomings of the Games in the closing ceremony: Some individuals participated in too many competition items, which affected their performance due to fatigue. Some people did not fully understand the competition rules, which shows that physical education is still not widespread. At the same time, he encouraged all athletes with four points: Cherish the results of the Games; Strive for a sports revolution; Strive for national honor; Enrich the knowledge of provincial construction.</p>
<p>In the overall results of this competition, except for the female high school track and field competition, which was won by the ninth district, all other first places were won by Lanzhou City. Therefore, the banner of "Foundation of Self-Improvement" awarded by Chairman Jiang was also won by Lanzhou City.</p>

<h3>South African Cloth Merchants Massively Purchase Hong Kong Cloth</h3>
<p>Totaling 116 Million Yards, Cloth Factories Will Need Two and a Half Years to Fulfill Orders</p>
<p>A South African company engaged in the cloth business has placed an astonishing order for cloth from Hong Kong weaving factories, totaling 116 million yards. Based on current Hong Kong production rates, it is estimated that for at least two and a half years, all output must be exclusively allocated to fulfilling this order, with no sales to other regions. Among the orders, Sudan intends to purchase 20 million yards, with a staggered delivery schedule, supplying 20 million yards annually. According to Mr. Sum Choi-wah, Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, 76 million yards are for South Africa, with the remainder for Sudan. Considering the current production rate of approximately 300 large and small weaving factories in Hong Kong, producing 100,000 bolts of cloth per month, 116 million yards is equivalent to about 2.8 million bolts, which would take two years and six months to complete. It is reported that part of the aforementioned order, totaling 60 million yards, was communicated to the Federation of Hong Kong Industries by the Hong Kong Department of Commerce and Industry, with the remainder being handled by foreign firms. It is also reported that a certain South African company inquired about cloth prices from Japan, but the Japanese were unable to supply such a massive quantity of cloth. A reporter asked Mr. Sum whether raw materials would become a problem if such a large order were to be secured by Hong Kong factories. He replied that with the assistance of the Department of Commerce and Industry, he believed it would not be an issue. Currently, the sources of cotton yarn are Bombay, England, Canada, and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Reforms Expected in Southern China Import Policy</h3>
<p>[Fuzhou, This Newspaper, 24th] According to a telegram from Hong Kong, the government will soon reform its import policy for Southern China, reportedly by relaxing import quotas and allowing merchants to import goods using their own foreign exchange, but with a doubling of tariffs. These imported goods will not be allowed for re-export, and this measure will only apply to Southern China. Upon hearing the news, Hong Kong merchants have been actively purchasing industrial raw materials, hardware, and foreign paper in preparation for shipment inland. Financial circles here told reporters that the government's move could provide Southern China's economy with an opportunity for recovery and also increase state revenue.</p>
<p>[Guangzhou, This Newspaper, 24th] The Southern China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee, to encourage banks to provide loans for export goods and earn foreign exchange, has decided to establish a Financial Committee for Export Goods. It also invites the Joint Four Branches, the Banking Association, the Import and Export Trade Association, and the Import and Export Industry Association to participate in discussions to facilitate exports.</p>
<h3>Domestic Tea Market Continues to Be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, transactions were scarce, and prices remained firm. Ewo Tea House offered the second and third batches of Keemun black tea from this year, and although Jardine Matheson had discussions, a deal was difficult to reach due to unfavorable timing. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, business continued to be brisk.</p>

However, prices at the production origin are the opposite. Therefore, most holders are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions are scarce.</p>
<p>During the first eight months of this year, the value of goods imported by the United Kingdom from China and Hong Kong was much higher than in 1938. Imports of British goods into China have increased particularly sharply, nearly tripling compared to the same period in 1938.</p>
<h3>Merchants Unable to Apply Due to Unreceived Registration Copies</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Since the government announced the measures for handling goods brought into the country and shipped by merchants with their own foreign exchange without licenses, it has been stipulated that relevant merchants must first apply for registration with the Import and Export Management Committee within a specified period. However, no one has yet come to register. According to explanations from importers and exporters, applicants for registration and purchase must submit an application form with the affixed seal of the registration copy sent by the secretariat of the Import and Export Management Committee, classifying the goods according to the attached schedule of tariff codes. They must then submit the application with the sealed copy to the competent authority through a designated bank. However, most merchants have not yet received the registration copies and are therefore unable to apply for registration.</p>

<h3>Cruel Husband Dies in Suicide Pact, Selling Motorcycle to Make a Living</h3>
<p>To the editor, Guang Sheng: I am a helpless and lonely woman. My husband, Liang Mingke, committed suicide on September 25th with a woman named Zhang Fengying in the lotus pond of Zhongzheng Park for the sake of an affair. My husband left no assets behind, leaving my family of five in dire straits. Therefore, I must make a desperate plea, asking for sympathy or reasonable relief from benevolent gentlemen of society, for which I would be eternally grateful! Although I have only been married to my late husband, Liang Mingke, for six years, we already have three sons, the eldest being only five years old, the second four years old, and the youngest three years old. I am also six months pregnant, and I have an elderly mother who needs my care. Now that the deceased is gone, the future livelihood of the living, and the education and upbringing of the children, have become serious problems! I recall that when my husband was alive, he was quite responsible for arranging the family's livelihood. Who knew that he would heartlessly abandon our entire family and commit suicide with Zhang Fengying, the woman who ruined our family? After much contemplation, I cannot believe that there is such a cruel husband and such a violent woman who would destroy a family with a wife and many children. I now plan to auction off the "ZUNDApp" motorcycle left by my husband to provide for the future education and living expenses of the children. Those interested in purchasing, please visit No. 27 Jing'an Villas, Nanjing West Road, to see the motorcycle. I would be most grateful if your esteemed newspaper could publish this. With sincere wishes for your well-being. Yours sincerely, Liang Hu Huizhen.</p>

<h3>Maeterlinck's New Work</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Maeterlinck has been publishing his anthologies for almost ten years. He prints meditations, diaries, essays, occasional poems or fables, fragmented scenes from plays, notes taken at any time, or excerpts from readings he has always remembered. This latest book, "The Great Beyond," even includes Bible stories as recounted by Thomas Mann.</p>
<p>Maeterlinck believes that God and the soul are unknowable. His mysticism remains unchanged. He continues to argue about the relationship between man and the infinite. "Honestly, what is the use of all these questions? Are they living with their eyes closed?" Maeterlinck also says: "Our naked eyes cannot see everything in the universe."</p>
<p>It is rare to see someone like Maeterlinck, at the age of eighty-four, who is able to be not sorrowful, not thinking of death, so serious, and not bitter, except for this Belgian master. He has not lost the wisdom of "The Blue Bird." This play has been popular in Europe and America for forty years and remains so today.</p>
<p>The last piece in this new book is a twenty-page short play, "The Old Man Who Does Not Want to Die," which is like a song carried on the wind, almost hard to hear, but still harmonious, all the way to the end. This is a beautiful work. This short play shows that everyone lives with his "shadow" and death. When a person dies, he does not need to fear God: he will not see "Him," not even the shadow will see "Him,"—because we are already in "Him."</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve last year, Maeterlinck broke his leg in the garden of his villa in Florida. It is unknown if he has recovered.</p>
<p>During the anti-Nazi war, we thought of the words in "The Blue Bird": "They need a hero to fight against injustice." He himself described the German invasion of Belgium in 1918 in a book called "The Mayor of Stilmonde." He defended his hometown, saying in a letter: "I am too late. Tomorrow morning I will inspect the troops, I will polish my Mauser rifle, which is really rusty."</p>
<p>Maeterlinck was made a Count in 1932, and he is an outstanding representative of modern Belgian literature. He was born on August 29, 1862, in the village of Oostacker. He was educated at the Christian College of Saint Barbe and the University of Ghent. He developed a great interest in beekeeping in his villa in Oostacker, and in May 1901, he wrote a famous book, "The Life of the Bee." In 1930, his interests shifted, and he published "The Mystery of the Stars." He had a villa in the summer in Great Temple and a villa in Nice in the winter.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-four, he was a lawyer. In 1892, he published "Pelleas and Melisande," mocking the cold-blooded people in the factories of Ghent. He felt that he was not fit to practice law and stopped his legal practice in 1889.</p>
<p>His family was not short of money, so he could devote himself to literary work. He began writing poetry and printed a volume in 1889. The most interesting thing is that his play "Princess Maleine" was originally a poem, and then completely rewritten as prose. He was not immediately famous. At first, people did not know him, but then Mirbeau called him "the Belgian Shakespeare" and quoted his aphorisms, and he became a household name. In 1895, he also translated Ford's "Tis Pity She's a Whore," renaming it "Annobella."</p>
<p>Two of his plays were printed in Brussels in 1890, and in 1891 he published "Sept Princesses," with a strong tendency to mysticism. "The Blue Bird" wrote about the fruitless search of the children in the woodcutter's home for the memory courtyard, the night palace, and the garden of happiness. They wanted to seek happiness for the sick child next door, but unexpectedly, happiness was waiting for them at home all day.</p>
<p>His characters are mostly like those in a dream state, "ghosts disguised as people wandering in the world." He lived in a bungalow in Paris for a period of time and met many Symbolist poets in France. His "Pelleas and Melisande" was adapted into an opera by Debussy, and his fame grew even greater. "Aglacaine and Selysette" is called a rare adventure of emotion and soul.</p>
<p>His Great Temple villa occupies thirty-five acres, with trees and meadows, and the scenery is very beautiful. It is a 13th-century building.</p>
<p>He no longer believes in fate. He feels that human will can overcome fate.</p>
<h3>Dream of Yangzhou</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruheng</p>
<p>In the Spring and Autumn supplement of Shen Bao, I often read the "Sequel to the Dream of Yangzhou" by my old classmate Hong Weifa Shiliang, whom I haven't seen in ten years. While admiring it, it aroused my interest in the study of the "Dream of Yangzhou."</p>
<p>Originally, during the Tang Dynasty, Yu Ye wrote a novel, "Record of the Dream of Yangzhou," which embellished the romantic anecdotes of Du Shou, a Tang Dynasty secretary of the Central Secretariat, in Yangzhou. Du Mu once wrote a poem, "Ten years of waking from a Yangzhou dream, I win a name as a heartless man in the pleasure quarters," which aroused the yearning and longing of later literati. Therefore, some legends and novels were also written, further enhancing the story of Du Mu. As far as we know, there are six types of books named "Dream of Yangzhou" in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>"Dream of Yangzhou" by Qiao Mengfu. This is a Yuan Dynasty zaju drama, which tells the story of Du Mu. It is considered the earliest drama written about the Dream of Yangzhou.</p>
<p>"Romance of the Dream of Yangzhou" by Ji Yongren. Ji Yongren was a native of Wuxi in the Qing Dynasty, using the pen name Baodu Shannong. Wu Mei included this legend in his Shemotoshi Qucong Yao.</p>
<p>"Yangzhou Dream Zaju" by Huang Shishou. Huang has a zaju drama called "Four Talents." "Yangzhou Dream" is one of the four, which tells the story of Du Mu marrying two courtesans, Ziyun and Hongyu. The other three are "Hundred Wheel Robe," "Immortal in Drink," and "Lanqiao Post."</p>
<p>"Romance of the Dream of Yangzhou" by an unknown author. This was written by a Qing Dynasty person and tells the story of Du Zichun. Du Zichun was a native of Chang'an and a wealthy merchant in Yangzhou. Later, he attained enlightenment through Laozi. The story is based on the Taiping Guangji. However, we only saw a brief record of this legendary story in the "Summary of the Comprehensive Catalogue of Tunes." There is a title but no book, so it is probably impossible to find an old edition.</p>
<p>"Notes on the Dream of Yangzhou" by Jiao Dongzhousheng. Jiao Dongzhousheng wrote his book after the Taiping Rebellion in the Qing Dynasty. Jiaomo is a township under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang. Because he traveled to and from Yangzhou, he wrote about some prosperous and charming stories of courtesans and some elegant poems. The book is divided into four volumes: "Dreaming People," "Dreaming Words," "Dreaming Affairs," and "Dreaming Emotions." The writing style is extremely elegant and worthy of a famous writer. It is now included in the "Beautification of Literary Masterpieces Series" published by the World Book Company. There is a preface by Bao Xingzi from the 22nd year of the Republic of China: "This compilation is a copy from the Jiangnan Library, written by Jiao Dongzhousheng. It narrates his life's experiences in the brothels, the harmony of his friends and companions, the prosperity of Yangzhou customs, and the superstitions of the people of Yangzhou. The lost stories and lost writings are all recorded without omission. The poems are sensual and the writing style is elegant and refined, which cannot be matched by modern novelists." These are indeed not exaggerated words. The writing style in the book is not something that the mandarin duck and butterfly writers of the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China could have written.</p>
<p>"Yangzhou Dream Novel" by an anonymous author. This was written by a Qing Dynasty person and describes the prosperity of Yangzhou during the Qianlong era and some fragmented records of society. The book intersperses some literati, with Zheng Banqiao as the central figure. Zheng Banqiao was a genius writer of his generation, with unparalleled achievements in poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He had a seal with the twelve characters "Kangxi Xiucai Yongzheng Juren Qianlong Jinshi." Although he was born in Xinghua County in northern Jiangsu, he often came to Yangzhou. The book records Ya Yu, who served as the Salt Commissioner of Lianghuai (written as Lu Du Zhuan in the book), Yuan Zicai (written as Yuan Zicai), Zhao Yunsong, Cheng Wuqiao, Jin Zongting, and some poets and writers who are yet to be verified. The book also describes the architecture of famous gardens, such as the "Jingzhao Xuan" villa of the Xu family, which is wonderfully decorated. In the middle is the "Shuizhu Ju," which is today's fountain. The water sprayed over the house like jade beads, which is clear proof that Chinese architecture at that time had been influenced by the West. In the book, Zheng Banqiao is written as Chen Wanqiao. The most unfortunate thing is that the author of the book did not sign his name, and the old edition has not been seen. It was printed and published by the National Studies Maintenance Society in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and it is difficult to find today. I will write a longer article to introduce it separately, so there is no need to say more here.</p>
<h3>Autumn Lyricism</h3>
<p>— Xiao Leng</p>
<p>Last night, I was awakened by the weeping of the gray sky. The night wind gently knocked on my window, saying that sadness had just returned from traveling in the West and wanted to step into my small room of memories to rest. I opened the window, and the tears of the gray sky were dripping down, and a strange sobbing sound was vibrating in the distance; a beautiful and sad face of a young girl appeared in the darkness outside the window....</p>
<p>In the early morning, I walked to the lakeside. The damp wind blew from the west of the lake, scattering the withered leaves of the French plane trees. Those unknown wildflowers drooped their heads wearily, and their petals were covered with sparkling tears; there were no pedestrians along the lake, and those lonely yachts were tied haphazardly to the shore.... The scene was desolate, but even more desolate was my distant longing.</p>
<p>For these full seven years, for your love, it will multiply in my heart on these dark and hopeless days, like wild grapes in the autumn forest. It blooms very robustly and beautifully, but no one notices it. Who knows that it has been growing and dying so lonely! I clearly know that this can only give me deeper pain, but sometimes pain is also endearing; because this pain is so pure and beautifully lovely. Even if no one appreciates this flower of love, I still cherish it, like cherishing my own young life.</p>
<p>There is no way for me to describe how this terrible and strange love has penetrated so deeply into the interior of my life; it has become a part of my soul, it absorbs my emotions with amazing power. It is the root of a big tree, and my soul is the soil, and my emotions are the nourishment. In theory, this tree should have large flowers and fruits, but because it is not illuminated by the sun, it finally withers....</p>
<p>This will always be an unspeakable sorrow in my life.</p>
<p>I remember those days we spent together, those long winter night conversations, and the clear tears and passionate kisses that will live forever in my memory. ...These vanished youthful days, like a string of ingenious pearls, I count them one by one; I carefully savor these warm memories.</p>
<p>God of love! You have cruelly abused a believer who has always been devout and faithful to you.</p>
<p>When I despise happiness and bear this pain, my heart is mournful, but I am still proud of my pure feelings.</p>
<p>The cloudy sky is inevitably sad, and I write them down casually as a melancholy record of an autumn day.</p>
<h3>Writers on Criticism</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Mengwu</p>
<p>Criticism has never influenced me in any way. Especially modern criticism is not suitable for influencing people, because critics do not read books carefully, cannot read, and often do not understand the books they read. Of course, this is not only about my books, but a general shortcoming of critics. The harm that "new" young writers suffer from him is very light. Attention should be paid to the negligent attitude of editors towards critical articles; probably the editors do not read it carefully. At most, it's just a general reading.</p>
<p>——Gorky</p>
<p>As far as being an artist is concerned, no one has ever heard of my paying the slightest attention to the articles people can write about me.</p>
<p>I think like Voltaire: "A few mosquito bites are not enough to restrain a galloping horse."</p>
<p>Speaking of these things, just let them talk. Their babbling will certainly not make anyone immortal, nor will it take away his immortality from Apollo, who makes him immortal.</p>
<p>——Beethoven</p>
<p>A critic should be smarter than a thinker and more talented than an artist, but he is not a creator and is not active, he is ruthless. ——Tolstoy</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"There are even more shallow things behind!" Yaoqun frowned with his reshaped eyebrows; "He underestimated me a bit. You see, after presenting some boring confessions, that fellow Buyer Sharf actually acted in front of so many people—the personnel of the puppet police station and special agents, etc.—requesting that puppet official to allow him to make a phone call. After their two sides made a show of questioning, that Buyer Sharf used countless strange gestures and actually made a phone call on the spot..."</p>
<p>"To the Japanese Operations Headquarters?" I couldn't help but guess.</p>
<p>Yaoqun: "Just fooling around, who knows who he called, but he used the Japanese language."</p>
<p>"How did you get out later?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It was truly glorious! The "General Headquarters of the Japanese Island Army's Operations in Tianjin" dispatched several guards, ostensibly to protect, but actually to escort me to their headquarters. Buyer Sharf also kept comforting me along the way, talking nonsense and promoting himself a lot; saying how influential he was with the Japanese devils, and even if the Japanese military didn't help him this time, he had even greater power that he could use. Anyway, there was no danger—referring to the status of me and him..."</p>
<p>Yaoqun said to this point, and then shifted his gaze from me to Little Tiger. I think he had already recalled Little Tiger's experience in Tianjin at this time. Little Tiger and I only met very briefly this time. He didn't mention to me anything about his work in Tianjin, and how he passed through Peiping and sneaked here again. Several times I wanted to ask him, but he diverted the conversation. At this time, I saw Yaoqun looking at Little Tiger, with a mysterious smile on his face, and I guessed that there must be a ridiculous story in it; just as I was about to ask Yaoqun about Little Tiger, Yaoqun had already started talking:</p>
<p>"You know," Yaoqun raised his eyebrows; "That fellow, Buyer Sharf, after taking me to the Japanese Operations Headquarters, didn't let me do anything alone until yesterday; like a ghost, he was always stuck behind me. Although sometimes he wasn't with me, every time I wanted to take some action, he would arrange a kind of defense in advance, restricting my freedom, so to speak, whether he was with me or not, I couldn't act alone."</p>
<p>I didn't quite understand. How could Yaoqun, such a formidable character, be restricted by this Buyer Sharf? Was he mainly using tricks and conspiracies, or was he using force? So I specifically asked Yaoqun about this point.</p>
<p>"This is a bit inexplicable." Yaoqun seemed a bit dazed: "Just to give one example, you can probably understand. For example, in the Japanese Operations Headquarters, whenever he met someone, whether it was a Japanese devil or one of our own people, he would rush to introduce me; when introducing me, he repeatedly made people pay attention to my face and clothing. So although he sometimes went to handle his own affairs, if I took one more step, it seemed like someone would make some kind of ambiguous hint or sound behind me, making me feel it was a warning, forcing me to stop my current attempt. So, it can be said that I have been simply restricted by him these past few days!..."</p>
