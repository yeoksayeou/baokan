<h3>今後治理台灣方針　白部長提六項建議　陳儀日內離台晉京述職</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕國防部長白崇禧，七日下午三時半在中宣部記者招待會中宣稱：台灣行政制度，已決定改爲普通省制，人事問題待主席返京後即可公布。白氏首就台事變之起因及善後措施分遠因，近因等數點，作詳盡報告，遠因則認爲基於在日統治下之五十年歷史，使台民教育，社會，經濟均受深切影響，近因則以對貿易專賣制度，行政畏官制度與共黨份子爲主，並說明其建議六點。記者等詢此項建議是否將爲政府所採納，白氏稱：建議中部分爲主席指示，部分爲實際觀察所得，大致可以採納，主席返京後，即可決定。又對事變時暴動份子所搶之軍火計數如次：手榴彈四千八百枚，步槍三千枝，手槍九十枝，惟陸續繳回者甚多。對所詢台變時陳儀對台胞施行報復一說稱：並未見到報復，政府軍隊有保議人民之責，絕不致報復。最後稱：余可負責言，此次事變，係由少數共黨份子及政治野心人士利用當地人民不滿現狀之心理，作爲導火綫，而絕大多數之台胞，對此均不同意，吾人希望今後不再有此事發生。台灣爲國防軍鎭，亦爲民族革命根據地，其愛國熱忱革命精神，均足爲模範，余相信可安定下去。台地已不需要再派兵前往，彼處現僅有一師軍隊，且爲在事變前即已決定派往者，今後治理台灣不靠武力，而在於政治，經濟上。又稱：台灣人目前藏於中央山脈一帶者的四十人，爲女共產黨員謝雪紅所領導。</p>
<p>〔本報台北七日電﹞台灣行政長官陳議，日內將晋京述職。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電﹞中樞紀念週七日上午九時在國府舉行，居院長正主應，行禮如儀後，由白部長　　報告赴台灣宣慰經過，白氏就台灣二二八事件發生之遠因，近因，分析甚詳，同時，對於中央處理經過及渠本人宣　後向中央所提建議，亦有所說明，據稱：台灣現已恢復常態，渠本人對處理此次事件所提建議爲：（一）台灣長官公署改爲省政府後，各廳處局，增設副首長，由台灣同胞充任，省府委員，由十一人增爲十五人，盡量羅致台省人才，縣市政府，原則上由台胞選舉。（二）經濟方面，當地重工業，由中央或中央與台省合辦，輕工業盡量開放，台省同胞，並有優先承辦之權。（三）台灣全省可耕土地，應由省政府租予農民使用。（四）撤銷專賣貿易兩局。（五）在中央對於幣制尚未完全整理之前，仍應維持台幣，惟與法幣之比價，應酌予提高。（六）設立台灣監察使署，整飭吏治，肅淸貪汚。</p>
<h3>白部長報告詞原文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕白部長崇禧，七日上午九時在中樞紀念週報告台灣事變之起因及善後措施，原詞如次：崇禧此次奉命宣慰台灣，於上月十七日自京飛台，本月二日返京，計留台半月，遵照中央寬大爲懷精神及指示原則，處理事變善後。關於此次事變之起因及善後揹施，在台時曾於歷次廣播中述明，京滬等地各報，多已登載，各項內容，均係根據實際觀察及接見台省官民兩方人士所表達意見，如台省縣市民意機關之代表，地方賢達林獻堂，丘念台，黃朝琴，南守信等，與台省軍政首長之報告，今天奉命出席紀念週報告，謹再摘要陳述：</p>
<p>甲　台灣事變之遠因</p>
<p>屬於教育者，台胞過去被日本統治達五十一年之久，被强迫學習日本語又，當時日本統治階級之野心，不但欲使台彎變爲日本之台灣，直欲使台胞變爲日本之國民，極盡分化之能事，儘量詆毁中國政府人民與軍隊，務使台胞發生不良之印象，台胞處於日本軍警高壓之下，積日旣久，雖大多數仍深明大義，不免有少數人對祖國語文旣感隔膜，對祖國國情，消息，又被封鎖，從而對祖國政府與軍隊，缺乏正當之了解。</p>
<p>屬於社會渚，過去日本統治台灣，對無業流氓，施以特殊訓練，作侵略祖國之鷹狗，或驅逐流氓於台灣凍南之火燒島，禁錮終身，光復後，此輩流氓，重回故土，習性難改，成爲擾亂份子。　屬於經濟者，台灣過去經日本五十餘年之開發經營，今林工礙建設均具規模，歷年日本本土取給於台灣之糧食資源，爲數至鉅，自太平洋戰事爆發，因受軍事影響，工商企業，逐漸衰落，民生困苦，與日俱增。光復後，益以戰時被日本徵調之台民壯丁達十萬餘人陸續遣回，形成嚴重之失業情形，此亦爲潛伏變亂之原因。</p>
<p>乙　台灣事變之近因</p>
<p>屬於經濟者，台灣經濟，向來與日本經濟配合，絲絲入扣，台灣產原料半製成品，日本則產製成品，例如米與糖，爲合灣之大宗之產品，台灣米糖生產之所以豐富，全賴化學肥料，而此化學肥料，則仰給於日本。日本戰敗後，工業停頓，無剩餘肥料足以供給台灣。按台省年需化學肥料，總量約廿五萬噸，台省工廠，所能生產者，年不過五萬噸，供求相差甚大，經多方爲世界各地搜購，亦僅獲少量，以致米糖生產，大受影響。勝利後，台灣之經濟，可謂完全脫節，加以原有工廠尚不能完全恢復，工人失業者爲數不少，在此情形之下，人民不滿現狀，自不待言，亦如內地人民，經八年抗戰之後，民生疲敝，對政府常有激烈之批評，此幾爲難以避免之事實，此種經濟狀况之調整，自稍需時日，非可一蹴而成。</p>
<p>貿易專賣兩局之設置，在收入上年達廿餘億台元之鉅，佔台省三十六年度總預算二分之一，政府財政上，雖獲補益，然因貿易局統制範圍過廣，民營工商業範圍日狹，遂使人民生計困難，失業增多。關於行政者，合灣光復之初，民情興奮，皆以重歸祖國，得以各省同胞獲得平等自由爲光榮，迨台省行政組織頸布後，則感於行政長官兼警備總司令之職權，固與日本之總督相類似，初猶以接收伊始，或將徐圖更張，台民對政府之擁戴，頗具熱忱，乃各級行政人員雖多謙能之士，然低劣者，亦所不免，尤以省市縣高級人員，任用合籍者過少，如台省行政長官公署八處正副主管中，僅有台籍副處長一人，全省八縣九市，亦僅有台籍縣市長二人，此蓋爲台省人士所甚爲不滿者。共黨份子之煽惑，自抗戰勝利後，言論結社，均極自由，國內共黨，遂藉此詆毁政府及國軍，歪曲事實，作種種惡意宣傳。台灣光復後，台省行政當局對政治上亦扶植民主，各縣市普遍成立民意機關，准許言諭自由，共黨及少數野心家，乘機詆毁當地政府，挑撥台胞與內地在台服務公敎人員間之惡感，亦與國內共黨同出一轍，影響所及，亂源滋生。</p>
<p>綜上所述原因，皆爲演成事變之起源，少數共黨份子及野心家·暴徒·浪人·藉專賣局緝私人員取締烟販作導火綫，煽惑脅迫，遂有一部份靑年學生台胞羣起盲從，乘國軍調防之際，擴大暴動，此輩少數反動派之野心，絕非出於單純之不滿意現狀，乃欲企圖顚覆政府，奪取政權。自二二八事變爆發，數日間即蔓延全台，所謂「二二八處理委員會」，更提出無理之三十二條件，要挾國軍繳械，接收政府機關及倉庫物資，同時，暴徒圍攻台灣行政長言公署，警備總司令部，襲擊基隆，高雄兩要塞空軍基地，軍需倉庫等處，由此種非法行爲所表現，充份證明其企圖推翻政府，奪取政權。又對內地派遺來台協助台灣建設，教育台灣子弟之公教人員及其眷屬，橫加毆辱，傷害或劫奪其財物，此等公教人員，不僅精神上受到威脅，物質遭受損失，甚至生命失却保陣，此種排外行動，迨整編第廿一師及憲兵調台增防，始告稍戢。台灣經過此次事變以後，就個人在台實際觀察所得及徵詢台省各方意見，崇禧認爲：對台省政治·經濟制度·必須從速改革，人事方面必須從速調整，現已擬具建議，呈報主席察核施行，在原則上即：</p>
<p>政治方面現台灣行政長官公署即改爲省政府制度，爲適應環境，將省府委員人數略增，並於省府各應處局增設副職。</p>
<p>經濟方面　（一）台省重工業，照中央規定應歸國營或與省合營，輕工業則盡量開放，獎勵民營，並儘先由台民多數集資經營爲原則，竭力避免為台省內外少數資本家所壟斷或操縱。（二）台省公有土地（包括山地在內）的佔全省百分之七十，應將可耕種者，即依照中央核准台省公有土地放租辦法施行，將公有土地分配有耕種能力之台民耕種，以裕民生，而救濟失業合胞。（三）專賣制度，按現行專賣物品計烟·酒·樟腦·火柴四種，決定縮小專賣範圍，擬將專賣局撤銷，另設烟酒公賣局。（四）貿易局擬即撤消，改爲供應物資之機構，僅統一管理省營工業成品之外銷及機器原料之採購，並可接受民營工業方面之委託，代辦上項業務。</p>
<p>人事方面過去任用台籍人士確實太少，今後台省府縣市各級政府負責主官，當以優先選用台省賢能爲原則。</p>
<p>爲澄淸史治，社絕貪汚，經建議請由監察院於台灣專設一監察使署，以專責成，俾充分行施監察職權，而樹立廉潔之政治風尚</p>
<p>最後須加說明者，即此次事變傷亡人數，據台灣警備總司令部報告調查結果，計軍警人員死亡官佐十四人，士兵七十四人，受傷官佐一〇八人，士兵二一八人，生死不明者，官二人，士兵廿四人，共計傷亡及生死不明官兵四四零人，各縣市公敎人員及暴動人民死亡者三〇四人，受傷者一五五六人，共計傷亡一八六〇人，比頃數字，係截至三月卅一日爲止。（完）</p>

<h3>共軍鐵蹄下之旅大</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽七日電〕即將進行接收之旅順大連，由於共軍澈底破壞與某方有計劃搬運，幾已成為廢墟。</p>
<p>物資無剩　旅順為東北九省大陸之海上門戶，更為我國今後國防之生命綫，日本投降後，共軍在北部先搶佔住木斯，在南部則盤據於此，經營不遺餘力。大連為東北唯一大輸入港，水陸交通便利，八十五年前，日寇曾視為補給重地，華北朝鮮一切軍火，食糧，生活必需品，及種種物資，皆囤積於此。共軍侵入後，遂大肆搜括，運往旅順，經二十個月之無情榨取，米貴如珠，人民以十件衣物，尚不能換得一飽，待估衣物，堆滿街頭，然問津者寥寥，即共軍新經營之百貨店，亦門可羅雀。旅大壯年男子，已大多外逃，近半月來，即老弱婦女亦相率出外就食。</p>
<p>圖阻接收　共軍在旅大之最高行政機關，為「行政聯合辦事處」，內該行政，工商，財政，教育，民政，司法，海事及衛生八工作研究委員會，並設有旅大公安郵電函總局聯合辦事處，以行政工作研究委會主任委負遲子祥為主席，並兼大連市長。共軍花旅大之政治作風，一面諂媚某國，一面拉攏奸商劣紳，其諂媚某國，係企圖阻撓接收，俾能長期盤據。其拉攏奸商劣紳，目的在維持工廠生產，及接濟兵源，故共軍之「清算政策」，在旅大尚未使用。</p>
<p>軍事佈置　旅大共軍兵力，約五萬人左右，其在軍事上之佈置，專致力於軍火生產與募集兵額，自國軍進駐普籣店，貔子窩後，共軍頗感恐慌，但恃國際複雜背景仍不顧一切，加強軍火生產，軍火廠設於偽滿鐵道工廠內，製造手溜彈，并趕製衝鋒槍。大連榮町鐵工廠，亦為其強佔，製造軍火，每日可出手溜彈三千發，砲彈百餘發。此外，趕製三十萬套夏衣，一併運往膠東。最近目知國軍即將前往按收，乃積極擴軍，所有黨員，至少要介紹二名青年入伍，每一閭長，介韶一人入伍，達者以反動論罪，同時利用糧荒，引誘青年入伍，並成立警務團，二千人集中訓練，担任暗殺工作。</p>
<p>經濟混亂　共軍更以各種手段，羅致財富，以致經濟情形，極為混亂，民不聊生。旅大原有偽滿幣，蘇聯紅軍票，朝鮮銀行券，日本銀行券流通市面，及共軍東北流通券，與中儲券發行後，暗盤交易，乃應時而生，偽滿幣一元，換紅軍累一元三角，鮮幣一元，換紅軍票二元日幣換紅軍票一元五角。至終共軍之東北銀行券，與中儲券，由於幣制之紊亂，發行之漫無限制，造成物價之奇昂。共軍除以其掠奪之物資及紙幣，將旅大民間黃金榨取一空外，更橫征暴歛，發行所謂「都市建設公債」，「信用貸款」及「軍事貸款」，搜括民財，實行納稅清算政策，追繳偽滿稅賦，未繳納清者，一律重征，發行商民公債卅億元，票面自五千元至十萬元，強制售與農民，同時派人清查商店帳目，或罰巨款，或課重稅，大部商店，均因而倒閉，僅卅六家，為共軍所經營之商店，壟斷市面，三菱三井等大工廠已為某軍強制接收。此外，共軍並按收世界，新華，中西，天光，國華，明上，友好，中葉八電影院，及大眾，光華，宏齊三大舞台。大迎偽市府，曾接收火柴，膠皮，鐵工，窰業，印刷，化學，鐵機，醬油，被服，製罐，製藥，製米及汽水卅餘工廠。</p>
<p>摧殘教育　旅大教育，已被捕殘殆盡，言之令人痛心。所有學校，或駐共軍，或被破壞，桌椅門窗，悉充燃料，設備儀器，悉數搗毀，而共軍猶倡教學方法，隨時隨地，隨便教習，稱為「提包學校」，至於中學教育，儘量宣傳「共產主義」，及毛澤東之「新民主主義」。</p>
<p>大連現有大連日報，新生時報，民眾報及實話報，前三者悉為共黨機關報，後者為蘇聯紅軍指揮部所辦，刊物則僅中蘇月刋一種，內容全係宣傳赤化者。</p>
<h3>出席泛亞洲會歸來　鄭彥棻談觀感</h3>
<p>與會代表充團分結合作</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕我出席泛亞會議代表團團長鄭彥棻，今晨由滬搭車抵京。據談及此行觀感稱：此次大會，為歷史上亞洲各國人民團體空前盛會，與會代表二百餘人，除日本外，各國均有代表參加，濟濟一堂，充分表現團結合作精神。鄭氏繼稱：本屆會議，收獲甚多，除通過各種重要報告外，舉其要者，第一為增進亞洲各民族相互之了解，第二為加強亞洲各民族之聯繫，此種了解與聯繫，實為促進世界大同之重要因素，亦為必經之過程，先以中；代表團代表在大會中曾強調「本屆會議是從亞洲團結到世界大同的橋樑。」</p>
<p>葉公超談話</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪以觀察員資格出席泛亞會議之葉公超氏，叩詢對此次會議之觀感。葉氏答稱：泛亞會議之舉行，並非亞洲之民族聯合對付歐洲民族或美洲民族，而為亞洲之民間代表眾道一堂，研究自己之問題，並謀與世界取得進一步之合作。我國代表在新德里，深感印度之偉大，人才之豐富，情感之　懇。問時印度亦自己承認有其困難與弱點；中國代表之赴印，一本既定之國策，對亞洲各民族希望其進步，逐漸取得經濟上文化上之解放，而使亞洲之存在，能與世界之繁榮打成一片。葉氏對外傳渠將任外次一說，表示不知其事。關於泛亞會議之本質，葉氏認為全為經濟文化性質而非為政治性。葉氏於昨晚十一時乘車晋京。</p>

<h3>駐日盟軍總部繼續努力　謀解决賠償問題　戰爭結束時蘇已獲二百億美元</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京七日合眾電〕記者獲悉：盟軍最高總部現繼續致力謀取日本賠償問題之完全與及早解決，并以數字送交華盛頓之遠東委員會，暗示事賞上日本之廣大海外資產，業經充為賠償物資。麥克阿瑟元帥認為如欲阻止日本工業生產之迅速衰落，即需解決賠償問題。此間高級官員稱：美國指令麥克阿瑟元帥開始撥付百分之之臨時賠卅償，僅為解決此項極重要問題之初步步驟。此問詔為日本賠償問題之最後解決方法，應相當簡單，如顧及日本之廣大海外資產，業經充為賠償物資，并對何種工業設施，應運往要求賠償之盟國者，迅獲協議，則此項問題，即可告解決。盟國官員告記者稱：戰爭結束時，日本國外之公司及私人資產總數，約為四百億美元，其中百分之九十九，分佈於中國東北·朝鮮·台灣·庫頁島·千島列島·中國內地，及南洋各島中。盟國官員雖不願公開發表，但事實上此項資產中之大部，乃在戰爭結束時蘇聯控制之區域中，故咸信美國將宣佈蘇聯所獲得之日本資產總值，在二百億美元以上，蘇聯應認此為既已獲得之賠償，蘇聯當局迄今仍堅持所有蘇聯業已取得之日本資產，應認為「戰利品」，而與賠償無關，美國對此，業表拒絕。日本官方對其一九三九年國外之政府資產發表估計數如下：中國東北八十億，朝鮮六十億，台灣十億，庫頁島十億，中國內部區域十一億美元，此外尚有其他資產，此項數字，不包括日本私人之國外資產，而私人資產，較政府資產尤鉅。</p>
<h3>水利委會發言人　駁斥新華社造謠　黃水歸故道後毫無泛濫情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕據悉：日前莫斯科各報遍載塔斯社關於黃河水災之陝北通訊一則，略謂：「據新華社訊，前此中國政府聯總中共及行總，雖曾協議須於大堤修復及河床居民遷移後，堵合黃河決口，而中國當局不顧協議，遽將花園口黃河決口堵合，致黃河之水流歸故道，在開封東北一帶泛濫，人民遭淹斃者甚眾」云云。永利委員會發言人頃語記者，此項通訊，殊與事實大相背謬；查黃河堵口復堤工程，自卅五年三月開工，中共即屢加阻撓破壞，至五月十八日，水利委員會與中共代表成立協議後，再積極趕辦，中共又藉口故道河床內有人民居住，應由中央發給遷移費，中央亦照商定辦法，先後撥發一百五十億元，交由行總轉發，迨工程進至相當階段，準備於凌汎前合龍時，中共忽又要求延期五個月後，始可合龍，其意無非欲將工程延至大汎期間，使堵口工作無法進行；嗣經幾度洽商，至本年二月七日，復由善後救濟總署霍署長，水利委員會薛委員長，聯總代表艾其頓將軍與中共代表董必武，在滬商定，下游中共區域復堤工程，應即刻開始堵口工程，照常進行，三月中旬合龍，合龍期前，由水利委會通知，聯總轉告共方。此次三月十五日合龍之前，水利委員會依照商定辦法畢知行總，轉知中共，至水利委員會趕在枯水時期堵合決口，正為防止大汎時之汎濫，而中共屢次阻撓堵口，適與防炎救民之旨相反。現黃河業已挽歸故道，流勢順暢，水頭已於三月廿一日十一時過利津入海，毫無泛濫情形。事實俱在，中外咸知，新華社通訊之憑空造謠，測其用意，當即淆惑國際聽聞而已。</p>
<h3>政院撥欵千四百億　復興黃河泛濫區　霍寶樹定十日飛豫視察</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕行總訊：類似美國坦尼西河流域TVA之集體建設工作，現正在籌備中。行總已奉政院令提出豫皖蘇三省泛區復興計劃，並立即作實施之準備，自黃河花園口合龍後，黃水對豫東，皖北，蘇北人民之威脅雖成過去，而毗連三省之六十四縣，遭九年大難，田畝被淹達一千四百萬市畝，人口死亡五十萬人以上，難民約五有萬人，如何復興該區？已非尋常之撫輯安綏所能奏效。行總提出之復興計劃，規模與TVA相牟，包括泛區水利灌溉工程之建設，機械化農業之應用，牲畜種籽農具之分配，村舍房屋之建築，公路及電話網之修復，電廠動力之建設，自來水及公共衛生工程之設置，及一般社會福利事業之舉辦等等，全部建設之完成，需時三年，約需國幣一萬億以上。當局已準備專款一千四百億元為第一年度建設經費，由行總就泛區災情最重之卅六縣實施工作，聯總並同意供給價值相當於一千二百萬美元之農工交通器材，復興工作如完成，黃泛區將為中國最富庶之農業區，行總工作已至末期，現準備以其最後力量與各有關部會併力實施泛區復興計劃之初步，將來行聯總結束後，政府仍將繼續完成之。行總霍署長寶樹，定於本月十日偕聯總遠東區域會代表及聯總行總高級技術人員四十餘人，赴黃河泛區勘察，並擬在開封舉行技術會議。</p>
<h3>豫泛區呼籲團抵京</h3>

<h3>蘇州明報被搗毀　全部損失達一億元以上　當局調查幕後鼓動份子</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州七日電〕蘇州明報為本埠歷史悠久之民營報紙，忽於七日上午九時三十五分，被羣眾四五十人侵入九勝巷之編輯部，先由一西服暨一黃色中山裝之為首兩人，查詢負責人何在，經侍役答稱已回寓所後，其中一人即抽出剪刀，割斷電話綫，一幕激烈開打場面，於此展開，一部份羣眾且隨帶鐵器，除將全部器材及電報房機件搗毀無遺外，並擊傷製版房職員二名，經十分鐘後，羣眾復　擁至馬醫科該報營業部印刷部，將五號鉛字盤推倒，所有材料，模子，辦公傢具，賬簿文件，亦均損壞，廣告部職負方幟次被毆受重傷。約歷十分鐘，羣眾即完全四散，故迨城防部憲兵警察局聞警出動警備車時，羣眾已　無一人。事後傳聞內有國立社教學院一部份學生參加暴行，其導火綫則為六日有遊客顧乃仁等，赴該校「抽政園」遊覽，在音樂室啟琴蓋彈奏，經學生勸阻未遂，竟發生衝突，且迫至獅子林動武，後經城防部調解寢事，七日明報刋載是項新聞，內容與事實略有出入，致激動學生憤懣情緒，遽以搗毀為報復。記者曾分訪兩方，探詢此不幸事件真相，據明報負責人稱，此項不幸遭遇實出意外，總計損失約在億元以上。據社教院當局稱，關於學生參與暴行，事前毫無所知，事後亦鮮跡象，經查點學生人數，亦殊無缺少，惟因新聞失實，激動學生情緒而謀報復一節容有可能，茍查有確據，必聽任依法懲處云云。蘇軍政當局特為此事件，於下午召集有關機關及當事雙方，舉行緊急會議，研究事件釀成真相暨善後步驟，一致記為恐另有奸徒假名滋事，為幕後鼓動主使份子，當經決定先調查責任，次予懲兇賠償等原則。現明報當局業表示靜候法律解決，並於八日起暫出四開一張。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>小本貸款問題</h3>
<p>小本貸款，已由本市冬令救濟委員會公告開辦，共總額為國幣一億元，其對象為（一）家境貧寒，有意於小本經營，而無法籌集資金者，（二）已有正當小本營業，因經濟拮据，無法周轉者，其月息為二分，其期限為四個月。照此辦法，可知其性質為低利貸款，其宗旨為扶助一般小本經營，其作用是積極的，不是消極的。如果稱牠為小額的低利工商貸款，似乎也未嘗不可。</p>
<p>所謂小本經營，他們原沒有資格，可以向金融業貸款。但以物價愈盤愈高，所需要的活動資金額，也不得不隨之而高。他們的信用，又比不上公司行號。在這商利貸的壓迫之下，其困難自不難想見。因為在平常時候，除掉政府機關以外，（戰前，本市社會局設有平民貸本處）還有若干慈善團體，也分担着這種義務。現在公私經濟，同感困難，社會局的平民貸本處，迄今還沒有恢復得起來，而私人舉辦的，又絕無僅有。這班小本經營的人，除掉七拼八凑，以高利向典當質押而外，竟沒有隨時可以融通的途徑。</p>
<p>所以冬令救濟會開辦這小本貸款，無疑地，是一種很及時，也是很合理的救濟事業。大家知道，現在工商業十分不景氣，失業的人數甚眾，有許多小工商業，無法支持得住，已降落到攤販地位，或改做單幫生意去了。那末，這種額的低利貸款，其需要的殷切，當然遠過於平時。昨據關係方面消息，此事甫經發表，各公典所接到的聲請書，早已超過了定額，就可以見：（一）一般需要的迫切，與（二）當前高利貸情形的嚴重。</p>
<p>所以就本問題而言，我們第一個感想，是額定一億元的資金，實在不够，亟應設法擴充。其途徑有三，如下：</p>
<p>一，發動社會的力量，設法勸募。好得為數並不很大，只消由各善團領袖，羣策羣力，登高一呼，似乎不難做到。</p>
<p>二，市府應於救濟經費項下酌量撥補，以資充實，不可完全將此項責任，諉諸民間。</p>
<p>三，以上兩項，或者緩不濟急，似可由冬令會或主辦此事的五人委員會，向市銀行商做透支，以期迅捷。</p>
<p>照以上這三條途徑切實做去，我們相信，再增加幾倍資金，似乎並不困難。所要研究和注意的，倒在於如何貸放這技術和人事方面。</p>
<p>照規定辦法，這項貸款，是委托各公典承辦的。先申謂，次調查，次彙送委員會審核簽發支票，再訂約對保。而且保證人「除負完全債還貸款及利息之責任外，並負所貸款，必須用於正當營業之責」，又規定「小本貸款，以一次為限，期滿不得申請續請，意思就是說，絕對不許展期。就條文說，已規劃得相當詳密。可是照過去經騐說，流弊却也根多。大致有三：（一）逾期不還，追查無着，（二）化名申請，一戶數貸，（三）經手舞弊，冐名自借。歸納起來，就是請貸的人，以為事屬救濟，圖沾得分外便宜。而經辦人員，也容有不知檢束，意圖取巧的人。雖是情境有異，今昔不同，未可以彼例此，也不便以一概百。但過去既有這種情弊，要不可不懲前毖後，慎之於始，這是我們首先應當貢獻的。</p>
<p>其次，是小本貸款，其範圍究竟有限，而且限於正當營業，未足以盡平民金融的能事。語云，「緩急人所時有」，一般家境貧寒之人，不幸遭遇到其他急迫的時候，便非這小本貸款所能為力，而依舊要仰仗到一般典當去了。典當的月息，現在雖已减輕，却還是高到三角六分，就是十八倍於小本貸款的利息。兩相比較，這是何等嚴重的一什事！所以本報日前在典當問題的檢討一文裏，曾指陳减低當息的必要，及其辦法。頗聞該業近曾召開大會，並議決低利貸款的請求，與我們的主張，可稱先後一致。可惜原則雖已通過，而辦法尚無所聞，離開實現的日期還相當地遠。所以對於冬令救濟會所辦的小本貸款，其即知即行的精神，益發覺得難能而可貴了。</p>

<h3>美蘇形成僵持狀態　外長會議無進展　癥結仍在德國賠賞問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科七日廣播：四外長會議須在附星期後始可竣事，參加者預料僵局可望打開，其一切結果將類似巴黎第一次外長會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科七日電〕參加四强會議之美代表團今日又表示妥協，認爲四外長或將至少尚有兩周以上留於此間，以便再度努力完成議程。美代表團之大部分代表預料外長會議將以僵持狀態結束，與去年第一次巴黎會議時情形相同。然而無論如何，在此間完成對奧和約，或可有微望，此爲美代表團希望最先能告成之事。美國務卿馬歇爾“前之主要目標，爲將議程上之所有項目，全部加以討論，（主要問題現已討論者尚不足一半）然後再對德國賠款問題稍事討論，隨後休會或將延會，直至今秋始能重開。今日之　强會議仍繼續討論德國臨時政府之形式與範圍問題，明日成星期三可能從事討論德國邊境及魯爾問題。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科七日廣播：四外長會再度討論德臨時政府問題，英法蘇意見頗見一致，美方則表示異議，仍未得要領。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫撕科六日電〕四國外長第四週會議，各方咸預料其將決定大會之成敗者，結果適得其反，令人大失所望。四國外長於四月一日舉行秘密會議，卒仍一無成就，此項秘密會議之重心，乃在美國務卿馬歇爾所提建議主張蘇聯重行考慮其自現行生產中提取賠款之要求，英外相貝文對於蘇聯之要求，一部分表示同意，但與此項要求有關之各種情形，甚為複雜與繁多，致使外長會議有無限期體會，而要求專家從長研究此一問題之必要。法國對於　聯之建議尤爲注意，良以此將影響法國所要求自德國取得之煤斤故也。莫洛托夫曾以雅爾達協定爲根據，要求德國賠款一百億，馬帥或僅欲試探蘇聯之意見，俾確定莫洛托夫外長是否凖備以此戰爲標準而論價，亦頗有可能。果爾，則馬帥現已臨進退維谷之境，蓋因蘇聯對於馬帥之建議，堅不表示讓步故也。要之，其他各種問題（包括德國之經濟組織及臨時政浩組織）現均視自現行生產中提取賠款問題而定。美英法三國昨日對於管理今後德國臨時政府中央經濟部之各種原則，意見業已一致，但在四國外長對於德國經濟統一，工業水準及賠償問題未曾成立協議之前，此種局部之協議，並無任何價値。且下所需者，似爲一聰明之談判者，必須能將一切使四外長會議無法進展之障礙予以排除。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾主張　波東陲還德　勢將引起劇烈爭執</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科七日電〕權威人士今日聲稱：美國務卿馬歇爾將力促四國外長會議，以現已劃交波蘭之德國東部農業地區，復歸德國管轄。四大國前曾商妥臨時協議，規定德波兩國以奧特河與尼斯河爲界，今馬氏主張，將使是項協議因而修改，聞美國代表團認爲德國人口稠密而高度工業化，但少糧食產地，故欲平衡德國經濟，非實行上項修改辦法不可，但此建議將成四外長此次會議中爭執最激烈各項政治問題之一，想係必然之事。現波蘭人不願喪失已獲得之領土，德人則竭力資成收回失地。據觀察家稱，外長會議發生是項爭執時，蘇聯處境最爲困難，因德波兩國共黨各圖爭取實力，然兩國目的各不相容，蘇聯處理此項問題頗非易事，且在德國西境，德國共黨與國際共黨之目的互相衝突，亦將使蘇聯左右爲難。外長會議對德國西境，現亦遭遇問題，如法國要求薩爾區及魯爾萊因區特殊行政　，西境基本問題，如波蘭邊陲，具有經濟與政治兩重性質。</p>
<h3>對奧和約　稍有進展　四外次已獲一項協議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科七日廣播：四外次草擬對奧和的，已有所協議，即：凡在德國佔領期問，猶人及其他各國人士所被侵佔之財產，應即予以恢復，如無法恢復，可予以適當之賠償。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科七日電〕四國外長代表擬具奧國和的，今日商妥奧國於納粹統治期內，因種族或政治原因而沒收之猶太人及其他人等財產，均須歸還原主，如果不能歸還原來財產，則應給予賠償。盛傳蘇聯外長莫洛托夫準備於聯合國賠償委員會向外長會議提出報告書時，重新抨擊美英兩國對德賠償政策。官方人士預料賠償報告書將於今日送達四國外長。</p>
<h3>西政局動態　復辟主張漸抬頭</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕「泰晤士」報馬德里記者稱：弗朋哥政權最近已呈類似，前共和國獨裁者李凡拉將崩潰前夕之現象，然以局勢複雜，故尚無早日解決之望。弗朗哥最近接見記者發表談話時，曾述及溫和派之反對，是不啻承認其反對者固不僅共產黨，流亡者，及遁匿山中之徒而已。馬德里及巴塞隆納之第五縱隊，對於弗朗哥固較在巴黎，里斯本，都隆之弗朗哥之敵更爲危險。帝制派之勢力，今已佔各反對派中之首席。每一黨包括共產黨在內，均有擁護復辟之人，所差者僅彼等與唐璜間尚缺市要細則之協議耳。以復辟為　礎糾織後弗朗哥聯合陣綫之企圖，已獲部份成功，惟政治自由之憲法保證及選舉權問題，仍爲最後協議之主要障碍。反對派內部之缺乏協議，使弗朗哥之地位一時尚不致動搖，何况弗朗哥尚有陸軍向其效忠。故推翻弗則哥一時尚無可能云。</p>
<h3>「杜魯門主義」觀察家評杜氏最近演說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕外交觀察家本日一致認爲杜魯門總統於傑弗遜紀念日所發表之演說，已毅然揭示世界性之門羅主義。如果美國國會支持杜魯門之立塲，則此一演說將於今後數年內遺下深切之影響。杜魯門援助希土兩國之計劃曾被人指爲世界性抵制共產主義政策中之第一步驟，而杜氏此次不僅不避嫌疑，且坦白承認確有其事，並引甩歷史作爲其立塲之辯護。杜魯門在演說中雖屢次表示有支持自由政府抵抗外來威脅之決心，面尤以演說終了時之數語，對其外交政策有極爲簡單明顯之說明，其言有謂：「常世界他處人民力爭人權之際，美國人民殊不容加以忽視，以爲與己無涉」。若干觀察家認爲杜魯門此言，可稱爲「杜魯門主義」云</p>
<h3>莫斯科電廣播　蘇聯對德日費</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦七日電〕莫斯科廣播本日引用「新時代」雜誌之言稱，蘇聯在對德日作戰時之戰事費用，計三千五百七十億美元，另有蘇境內受德國損毁及據掠之直接損失，計一億二千八百萬美元云。</p>
<h3>戴高樂發表演說　呼籲法全國團結　與美合作維護世界和平</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社法國史特拉斯堡城七日電﹞戴高樂將軍今日在紀念史城解放儀式中，第二次發表演說，略謂，美蘇兩國難免造成對立形勢，故在此情形下，法國有統一與團結之必要，俾成爲歐洲之中流砥柱，而貢獻於世界和平。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎七日廣播：戴高樂今日發表演說，要點如次：（一）爲應付目前危機，法國必須修正憲法；（二）法國應繼續維持西方化，美蘇之繼續對立，法國必須維持均勢因素；（三）德國必需完全解除武裝，俾其無法再從事侵略。</p>
<p>〔路透社期特拉期堡六日電〕本日爲斯特拉斯堡城光復三週年，此間舉行紀念儀式，戴高樂將軍向數萬民衆發表演說稱，假使新的暴虐政治，威脅世界之一部或全部，則美法兩國必能携手合作共同反抗。將軍對美國助戰之功勞，備極推崇。渠又指出美法兩民族間類似的觀念，使兩者間成立一種異乎尋常的道義連繫，任何變化，都不能破壞此等運繫。他又說，每當世界的公理受到創傷時，美國與法國人的關注必同時發生，美法兩大民主國於保衛陷入危險中之自由時，均能發出同樣有力的反響。今日的世界，前面有尚欠明晰的地平綫，困難重重的道路，爲解決人類今日所面臨的問題，尤其是和平的問題，世界各國尤其是四大强國，均負有重大的任務。戴高樂並於今日致電艾森豪威爾將軍，內稱，「値茲阿爾　斯陣亡美軍紀念碑揭幕之日，本人謹向將軍致敬，吾人對將軍一致永矢勿忘，吾人將永遠記得昨日今日及明日勇敢的美國軍隊」。斯特拉斯　市議會共黨議員拒絕參加今日之儀式。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦拉斯堡六日電〕戴高樂將軍　在此發表演說，坦白放棄法　政治家力圖保持之法國在對美蘇關係中微妙的均勢，渠聲稱，美國與法國必能同意以反抗任何新暴政，在塲聆聽之數萬法國人莫不一致承認戴將軍所指者必係蘇聯。</p>
<h3>美電話工人罷工　參加者達三十四萬人　全美電話均發生阻礙</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕美國電話工人約三十四萬，已於今晨罷工，致全國電話均受阻礙。罷工開始於午前六時（東部標準時間），三小時後，西海岸電話工人亦停止工作，工潮遂遍及全國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電﹞全國電話工人聯合會會長襲恩於今晨五時五十五分（美國東部標凖時間）聲稱，全國電話工人已實行罷工。勞工部長許威侖貝克於最後一分鐘籲請展緩罷工四十八小時，工會政策委員會各委員自臥榻起身，聽取許氏呼籲，但置諸不覆，數分鐘後，電話工人遂開始停止工作。</p>
<h3>美國慶祝陸軍節　參謀長及陸長發表演說　力言美國擁有強大陸軍必要</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓六日電﹞本日爲美國參加第一次世界大戰第十三屆週年紀念日，亦即美國陸軍日，陸軍部長柏德遜發表廣播演說，力言美國擁有強大陸軍之必要。吾人不應忘懷在此不完全之世界，軍事力量仍能決定各國之命運。西點軍官學校辦理妥善，成績卓著，殊堪稱道云。此外，美國陸軍參謀長艾森豪威爾元帥亦發表廣播演說稱：美軍所負有獲致安全與和平之任務，須賴美國人民之支持，始能完成。除非能恢復過去之精神，且能相信必能獲得美國人民之支持，否則美國陸軍即不能完成其任務云。</p>
<h3>全國各地情況熱烈</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓六日電〕四月六日至十二日爲美國陸軍週，將舉行紀念，其意義爲致力於「强大之美國方爲和平之美國」。在此一週內，全美國不少機構，報紙，無綫電節目及社會個人，均將參加慶祝典禮及各種活動，向陸軍及爲國犧牲之健兒致敬。陸軍節正日則將於明日（七日）舉行紀念。陸軍節與復活節將合併舉行嚴肅之宗敎儀式，全國各地敎堂將由陸軍牧師舉行特別和平祈疇。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科七日電〕美國代表團昨夜舉行鷄尾酒會，紀念今日美國陸軍節，蘇聯上將十餘人均被邀參加，蘇聯最高將領柯多柴夫亦臨塲，此人與美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥尚係初次會面，但其談話題目以莫斯科之氣候為限。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京七日專電〕今晨閃電式P-80噴氣推進機八架，於陸軍節日閱兵典禮舉行時，低飛掠過檢閱點上空。世界最快速之射座式飛機編隊，於東京上空飛行，尚以此爲首次，觀衆均爲其驚人高速，驚異不置。</p>
<h3>英國防大臣演說　堅持一年徴兵法</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦六日電〕英國防大臣亞歷山大，木日在威爾斯朗杜諾城發表演說稱：政府當局將不顧前任首相邱吉爾之批評，堅持共一年徵兵法案。議會若通過保守黨之修正案，則內閣將辭職。前任首相邱吉爾嘗發表聲明謂：保守黨及自由黨所以投票贊成政府，其故厥因彼等聞及各部大臣發表公開聲明之後，深信政府向議會所提出之計劃係縝密研究之結果，且係以軍事專家之建議爲其基礎，有以致之云。實則政府當局確在事先徵得參謀總長之同意，而後決定將軍訓期限自十八個减至一年者。余目下仍擬維持此項決定，汝等以國防之負担加諸吾人，吾人若冒不必要之危險，而使全國於日後發生不幸，則汝等之欲抨擊吾人至體無完膚者，必大有人在。吾人提供諾言，將盡力之所能，繼續工作，使國際機構能在鞏固之和平基礎上，以眞正之集體安全，爲其目標，獲得成功。以言保守黨之修正案，余願要求工黨議員勿通渦此項修正案，良以此在事實上乃爲　責工黨內閣之議案故也。此種議案若獲通過，則工黨內閣將不得不辭職。至一九四九年一月，陸軍七十萬名將退伍，唯有徵募新兵或志願兵始能補足之，此即除非吾人能採取適當步驟，否則陸軍之地位，就效能與管理方面而言，將受威脅之謂云。</p>

<h3>梅斯伯案辯論終結　諭定本月十四日宣判　檢察官對鮑太太等兩證人表示懷疑　被告律師謂經濟方案未屆生效日期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「洋老虎」案，昨日地院三度開庭，辯論終結，定四月十四日宣判。</p>
<p>被告梅斯伯供詞與上二庭無大差別，孟庭長對黃金美鈔部份，特別注意，並詢問證人鮑太太曰：汝對抄獲之美鈔二萬一千二百零一元，及黃金卅八條，偌大數目財產，寄存於人，僅持一無記名碼單，並無其他證明文件，何信任之甚？鮑太太答稱：該項黃金美鈔，係由天津林興公司轉託上海新豐公司代購，因林興公司經理王棟臣係素識，由其負責轉託，不疑有他。庭上又以飽太太所持碼單上有「聯豐」字樣，而非「新豐」，訊以何故？鮑太太不能答覆。孟庭長乃詢證人陳協鑫，據答：此項金鈔因新豐受天津之委託後，又轉託彼代購，彼亦設有字號，名「聯豐」，故給飽太太之碼　，用「聯　」箋書寫。又稱：因彼無保險　設備，故寄存於埃勃斯公司。至此</p>
<p>開始辯論</p>
<p>檢察官匋起立稱：（一）我國外匯由中央銀行統一管理，非經允許，任何銀行錢莊，均不准經營，而被告主持之埃勃斯公司，則任意賣買外匯，供給非法走私商人。（二）黃金美鈔部份，雖有鮑太太前來認領，但未能提出有力證據，如此鉅額財產寄存他人，豈能無正式收據，或其他寄存之證件，且掮客陳協鑫之身份，亦</p>
<p>晦而不明</p>
<p>據飽太太所呈在天津時所接獲信件上稱：「本行不幸事件」，此「本行」究係何指，大堪研究。繼由被告辯護人陳霆銳律師申辯五點：（一）經濟緊急揹施方案，與的法相抵觸之處甚多，且未經立法程序，司法機關不得依此起訴及審判。（二）假定該辦法第七條果爲法律，但本案發生時（三月三日）在上海尚未施行，因法律施行日期條例之規定，江蘇省（上海與江蘇省同）限政府公佈後十五天生效，經濟緊急措施方案公佈日期爲二月十七日（民法第一百二十條規定，以期日定期間者，始日不起算），故該方案之在上海非至三月五日零時不能</p>
<p>發生效力</p>
<p>（三）埃勃斯公司係一外匯掮客公司，起訴書中稱該公司爲「銀行性質之組織，」有失公允。（四）該方案第七條專爲禁止外國幣劵之流通，並不禁止外匯流通，埃勃斯公司所經營之信匯電匯，均不在禁止之列。（五）該方案第七條所沒收之幣券，乃指正在流通之特定幣券，埃勃斯公司被抄出之外幣，係在靜止狀態，不能沒收。故請宣告被告無罪，停止覊押，並發還抄獲之全部財物。</p>
<h3>收回英商電車　需美金四百萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市英商電車公司於一九〇五年十月十日與前工部局簽訂之專營合的，規定有效時間爲三十五年，（至一九四〇年十月十日滿期。）期滿後。工部局如欲估價收回，應於滿約前六個月通知聲明廢止，否則即作自動延長七年。後因於一九四〇年滿期前，前工部局並未通知廢止，故延期七年至今。現又瞬將期滿，按規定，本年四月十日即應將決定通知該公司。市府當局爲此問題前曾在市參議會大會提請公決，但結果並決議原則收回，而並無具體辦法。今聲明日期在即，吳市長特於昨日下午在市府大禮堂舉行茶會，招待市參議會公用委員會及有關方而人士，聽取意見以作決定。</p>
<p>昨日商討結果，仍無確定，但多數意見，表示可繼續延期七年。據吳市長說明實際問題謂：據調查電車公司一應資產，價值的在美金四百萬元以上，目前無法申請如此龐大外匯，如以國幣折合收回，該公司是否同意尚成問題，而况即使以國幣價購，亦需五百億元，經費籌措當非易事，故特徵求市參議會意見。當經紛紛發表意見，多數認爲該公司執行業務，在不妨害我國主權之原則下，不妨再予延期七年，然後籌措辦法於滿期後收回。但希望市府當局對於管理本市電車應有一統一辦法。目前租界均已取消，自毋需有英法各立辦法之必要。同時關於目前種種管理失當之處，亦應嚴密注意，設法改善。　吳市長對於在座者之意見，表示極爲重視，將以之參考，而作最後決定。</p>

<h3>重文輕武宋明覆亡　國防部引史鑑　宣導征兵意義</h3>

<h3>鵝毛九十擔　承運起歹念　船戶私售敗露　人贓俱被緝獲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蕪湖人祖卓吾，現住山柬路金隆街四十八號廿八號房間，曾於本年二月十六日，在原籍委託船戶蕭從起（江西人年卅五歲）裝運鵝毛九十擔來滬，蕭因祖並未派人押船，頓起歹念，在船抵上海後，竟私將鵝毛以每擔廿萬元之價格，售與中正柬路三六六號源豐盛皮毛號主人盛禾舫，計價一千六百六十萬元，當收貨款一部份計二百四十萬元。蕭原係一窮措大，一旦</p>
<p>獲此鉅款</p>
<p>除付船伙工資外，即以十八萬元購手表一只，十五萬元購派克自來水筆一枝，並以五十萬元添置中山裝一襲，闢室逆旅，尋花問柳，嚴然以商人自居。祇自鵝毛啓遝後，即轉道由京抵滬，靜待貨到，善價而沽詎事隔月餘，竟音信杳然。</p>
<p>情知有異</p>
<p>乃四出探詢，並至沿江碼頭一帶向船帮訪問，直至上月底，始在蘇州河宜昌路碼頭，發現蕭之帆船，遂報告水上警局，派員轉輾將蕭拘獲，解送警局偵緝科偵查後，始供出前情。惟當警員至收贓犯盛禾舫住處時，盛已不在，旋經多方調查，得悉上項鵝毛已由盛於常日（三十九日）以卅一萬元之價格轉售與北京路松壽里六號永盛交毛號主人楊福全，乃往將楊拘獲，一經偵訊，直認不諱，惟不知係屬</p>

<h3>主要物價突起漲風　當局積極設法鎭定　已電請禁止食油原料出口　並取締米產區抬價及私運</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自經濟緊急措置方案公佈以來，本市物價已趨平靜，然因銀很鬆濫，游資伺　而動，致近日物價又有漸形上漲，尤以食油·米糧·紗花爲最。吳市長以其影響市民生活至鉅，十分注意，特於昨午招待記者時稱：食油所以上漲，主因爲出口太多，本市油類並未過剩，而大豆·芝蔴·花生等原料及製成品之輸出，則源源不絕，以致形成供不應求，刺激油價上漲。爲此，市府已電政院，要求禁止食油原料出口，相信該項禁令，不久當由政院轉達扛海關執行。市長稱：目前糧食部所供給油廠者，爲每月大豆八千噸。</p>
<p>食米之波動，多半係受雜糧影響，市長並指出另一漏洞：禁止食米運往北方，政府早有明文規定，不意近有北洋帮頻頻以米糧偸運北方，致使產區如靑浦等地價格，逐漸上昇。故市府亦已呈請中央嚴格執行經濟緊急措置辦法，查禁偸運，米價當能逐步下降。目前在政府控制下之存米，有相當數量，當然絕不致有影響。</p>
<p>紗花價格，短期內可望抑平，聯總大量紗花業已運到，又二十萬包棉花，昨已結好外匯，可以立即進口，該項美棉官定價格，經濟部正與聯總商量中，不日當可公佈。市長末謂：上海一切容易波動，在於謠言太多云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據悉：經濟部頃以各地油價騰漲，與食油之大量出口，不無關係。爰特令飭各地關係當局，着於即日起，暫時禁止食油出口。待油源充沛後，再考慮開放出口云。</p>
<h3>國行召集米粉油三業　商討如何平衡市價　並規定每週五召開談話會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行張總裁劉副總裁於昨日下午五時許，在國行會議室，召集本市食米，麵粉，食油三業人士談話，至七時許始吿散會。昨日會議席上，張總裁表示：渠離滬已十餘年，此次返滬，亟擬明瞭本市各業情况。最近中央方面，立意平穩一般物價。惟以糧食價格，常領導一般物價。故特召集米，粉，油，各業人士談話，共同研討（一）如何充責滬市存糧，（二）如何平抑糧價，（三）如何使糧價與一般物價平衡。　由各業人士發表意見。首由米商方面表示意見，略稱：（一）本市每月耗米五十萬石，惟近日來滬市米價低於產區，發生倒掛現象。目前上海糧商手中存糧，僅十五萬石。且近日鎭江蕪湖兩地，食米私自出口甚多，望政府注意及之。（關於此點，國行表示糧部谷部長，已派負赴兩地制止。）（二）運輸工具應予糧商以優先權利。又糧商不堪高利貸壓迫，　望政府給予低利貸款。同時望政府在滬經常維持存米十萬噸，以備米價波動時拋售。（關於此點，國行表示：政府在滬確有存糧十萬噸，且西貢暹羅兩地，最近一月內，可有食米六萬噸來滬。）（三）望政府以手中所有之日用品及旦餅，平價與農村易取糧食，俾免穀賤傷農。次由麵粉商方面表示意見，略稱：上年本市麵粉廠曾在蘇北如舉一帶，辦到小麥三百萬担，尙堪應付本市粉業需要。本年仍望政府在京滬，津浦，蘇北地帶，給予粉廠購麥之便利。同時望政府趕辦若干洋麥，一方面予廠商以低利貸款，如本市麵粉供應有餘，則應准自由出口。（國行表示：當局已定妥洋麥十萬噸，即可分批運滬。）最後由油商方面表示意見，略稱：希望政府協助解決原料問題。各民營廠已向東北方面定購之大豆五千餘噸，望准予出。（國行張總裁表示：先由民營廠具呈申請，俾轉東北經委會照辦。又關於原料之供應問題自本月份起，決由中信局每月供給大豆八千噸。）</p>
<p>又昨日會議席上，決定今後每週五，由國行劉副總裁，召集米粉油三業人士，談話一次，以便隨時商討解決各業之困難問題。</p>
<h3>社會局將召開　物價評議會</h3>
<p>市社會局長吳開先甫由靑浦掃墓歸來，記者叩以有關本市物價管理各項問題，承答：物價旣經波動上騰，以社局立場，擬儘量削弱各項人爲作用物價評議會之召開，已不容稍緩，藉以加强市堪波動之的束力。現決定先行集合各小組商討後，再提大會追認。今日（八日）首先召集食油組，食糖組，此外柴炭等三組，定九日召集，其中原有煤斤組、決改爲柴炭組，大會定十日（星期四）午在社局正式舉行。除對各組評價作初審決議通過外，尤須將各該組所提管理辦法作統盤籌一劃，使切實執行而獲事半功倍之效。</p>
<h3>食糖黑市猖獗</h3>
<p>十四期配糖待商決</p>
<p>最近食糖因產地市價高過上海，外埠均改向本市採購，而本市糖業亦受目前銀根鬆動關係，致領得配售食糖後，多不願輕易脫手，黑市乃益趨猛升。茲悉市社書局爲抑平食糖黑市，業定本週三召開食糖評價會議，將重行觸整食糖配價，故台糖公司本週四第十四决配售食糖，屆時是否能如期開配，聞尙待市社會局開會商討後，始可決定云。</p>
<p>又訊，昨糖市因公會停交，台糖確無做開。土糖到源寥寥，產價步升，故開價有步緊之象。</p>
<h3>紡建估價　原則決定</h3>

<h3>紗花布演三組織跳　紡建售價逐期增高　人心激昂客銷興旺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日，紗市漲勢益熾，棉花一再狂跳。紗廠因原料抵補不進，對粗細棉紗均有不願開售之槪，致市塲念支紗又漲念萬，卅二支細紗及四十二支雙股允爲俏利，一跳四十萬，人心之昂得未曾見。因紡建仍在逐期加價，客銷幷不寂寞，故趨勢依然挺秀。</p>
<p>棉布於上週六即露秀色，頃因客帮採購增加，實銷興旺，而棉花存底枯燥，紗價劇升，刺激棉布市塲，使各檔細布均吿上漲，嗣由該業理事長通知停止交易，終於造成塲外買賣，聞12磅龍頭細布近十八萬元，收購者頗爲踴躍。</p>
<p>棉花市況因運輸尙不便利，來源依然不暢，而存底日枯，紗廠納胃不弱，人心頗爲堅挺售價昂俏異常。昨申新紗廠進浦東火機花，大成紗廠進漢口細絨花，同業亦有成交漢口細絨各約一二百包。</p>
<h3>產米地區市價步升　南市塲放寬限價　白粳連佣十二萬二千元　門售規定不超過十三萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日南北市共到米糧四千三百餘石，各產地米價猛漲不已，申方隨之　昂，店胃轉暢，粳秈米及白元陰元等，一致緻見飛漲一萬餘元。照十一萬元限價，米商實難維持，昨晨十時半，特推代表瞿振華張錫潮顧益生徐頌仁查寳山五人晋謁吳市長面陳困難，要求市長設法壓低產地價格，經市長允代設法，專電糧食部請求准予照辦。同時南市塲管理委員會決議爲維持米商血本起見，暫改定白粳連佣價爲十二萬二千元，較前已寬放一萬二千元，門售價規定不得超過十三萬元。其正式新議價，須待本市物價評議委員會成立後，再行決定云。</p>
<h3>不定期本票　中央銀行決不發行　市面傳說全屬無稽</h3>
<p>日來市面盛傳中央銀行又將發行本票，流通市面，頃據中央銀行負責人談：中央銀行決不發行不定期之本票，市面傳說，全屬無稽。目前僅銀錢業聯合準備會爲免點收鈔票之麻煩，有簽發類似不定期本票之保管證及寄庫證，亦係限於同業間之信用，國行亦可接收。至一萬元大票，目前亦僅五百關金一種，關於報載福州分行所發之本票，想亦係即期本票。負責人並謂：自經濟緊急措施方案實施後，金融及各業市塲均極安定，投機者已無用武之地，此種議言，想係野心份子，別且企圖。</p>
<h3>絲綢市價飛漲</h3>
<p>人造絲因配售展緩，連日買風甚熾，昨市開盤即高，一二〇號高山有光七百六十萬元喊開，實銷方面吸收甚殷，故迄午收盤價爲七十五萬元。下午更見抬高，最後竟喊到八十萬元爲度，結果比上週末大起七十餘萬元。七五號金鷄半光討價一千二百萬元，惟無或交。廠經因人造絲上漲，兼因存底日稀，故昨市成交價亦比上週末大二三十萬元。A字等組織做開八百廿五萬元、B字等級八百零五萬元，CDE等級無貨供應。雙馬陳貨喊價七百六十萬元，綢貨因原料劇漲，稍呈活躍。大誠格子壁縐昨一萬七行咕百元有成交，華中縐客帮有云胃，故市價昨做五千八百元及六千元兩檔。</p>
<h3>閩木到貨仍多　杭木又轉稀落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閩木杉木條子，圓桶等到貨不絕如縷，市况挫疲已久，但以來價甚高，恐難再低。杭木日來到貨又轉疏落，杭州松板到貨則較前爲多。</p>

<p>晨開　現穩　平，人心因平行綫本票流言而堅，遞永紗開後據漲到二六七〇元。雖有人逢高出售，紗價見俏，人心仍穩。迨一四五號二二三號一六號一四九號一五二號一五三號四號六五號陸續賣出，盤旋而降，二二三號之了結，影響檯面，人心見怯，近年曾盤低至二五六〇元。現永紗以成交不多，行市未能跟隨，臨收時美亞遞交經一一七號力購而回漲甚勁，一八〇號一七九號一九八號趁勢稍納，遞永紗升至二六〇〇元結束。收後微升，結果較前收計永漲信和華豐新光中法微漲，新華平平，美亞勤興微降。遞交計永紗信和華豐新光微升，美亞降降，冷股中紡大通平平，榮豐景綸麗安跌半成　，商務內衣各升半成，餘榮　俱　。</p>

<h3>統債下跌</h3>
<p>公債昨傳聞戰前存款有五十倍償還之說，人心失望而見疲，統丙晨開即低至一一〇〇〇元，開後盤低至一〇五〇〇元，而後經補空而轉定，在一一五〇〇元左右頗多掙扎，嗣後升為一二〇〇〇元高價，結果仍波，較上週六各債均跌五六百元，統丙獨跌一千四，成交仍祗二三百萬元。</p>
<h3>外股微見疲軟</h3>
<p>外股昨交易不多，臨高有少數存多塞出，勢難向榮。惟在低價亦有零散之買戶，逢低吸收，形成待徊，中途缺乏變化。午後在沈靜市况下，微見成軟。結果較上週六計各股均見微降，獨電話在贈股消息下，微吿上漲。</p>
<h3>外銷茶成交少　獅峰龍井價堅昂</h3>
<p>上週本市某出口行曾向國外兜售之紅綠茶茲悉：其中一部份已獲得彼地需要，故吐納談判稍形熱絡。惟買方一味抑價，賣戶雖自願讓步，但亦不忍過份割削，收市結果交易未見進展，市勢則咸露軟化。至於內銷茶猶在供求平衡下，比前難分軒輊。溫州明前新龍井，自日前　塲後，邇來福裕及同泰祥等茶行，續有躉額裝到，其數的百餘件左右。價格方面因到多影響，突吿猛烈下挫。刻下同業對做價每擔已小至一百五十萬元，比開盤時竟跌去五十萬元之鉅。綜觀此稱情形，嗣後到貨如仍蟬聯，底盤岌岌可危</p>
<p>〔又訊〕品質鮮嫩，茶汁純淸之杭州獅峯龍井，本年度新貨已於昨日蒞滬。但到數不多，僅二十餘斤，執貨者居爲珍品，仰天討價，行情驚人，每斤竟昂叩六萬元。</p>

<h3>管制下的日本</h3>
<p>— 陳訓悆　（二）</p>
<p>盟單總部一年半以來對日管制之實踐</p>
<p>盟軍佔領日本以後對日綜合管制方案，曾於一九四五年九月廿二日由美總統杜魯門核准並予以公開發表。此一文告，即眾所周知之『對投降後日本之美國初步政策』，亦即盟國最高司令官及美政府有關各部對日管制之指導方針。茲為使讀者易於明瞭整個管制政策與其實踐起見，特將該文告之第三及第四部分（政治及經濟）節述如次：</p>
<p>該文告第三部分（政治）首先指出盟軍佔領日本之主要任務，在於解除日軍武裝並消滅日本軍國主義之禍源。日本國民應切實認識日本陸海軍之主腦人物及其協助者所加於彼等自身之桎梏與苦痛，為欲消弭此種苦痛，盟軍不得不實行如下之必要措施。</p>
<p>（一），日本不得再有陸海軍，秘密警察組織及民用航察事業存在；（二），解散日本海陸空軍，並解除其武裝；（三），解散日本大本營參謀本部及一切秘密警察；（四），立即全部繳出日本陸海軍武裝，器材，艦船及其他軍事設施，包括陸海軍用及民用航空飛機在內；（五），日本大本營參謀本部中及政府機構中之陸海軍高級官史以及鼓吹日本極端國家主義軍國主義之首腦份子，從事侵略戰爭之主要份子，應即予以逮捕，聽候處分；過去曾從事軍國主義與極端國家生義活動之知名之士，亦應立即褫奪其公職；凡屬極端軍國主義社團，不論其為社會的，政治上，商業的，應一律予以解散，並禁止其活動；（六）教育制度中凡含有軍事教練學說及軍國主義活動者，應即予以取締。（七），過去曾任陸海軍之將校士官以及曾從事軍國主義或極端國家主義活動者。均不得參與教育事業。</p>
<p>其次，該文告，指出審訊日本戰孚罪犯之重點，固不僅在於消極地對戰犯之懲處，抑且在於積極地謀求世界人類之水久和平。故凡曾對聯合國俘虜及其人民施以暴虐行為者，以及經盟軍最高司令官或聯合國機構指明為戰犯予以審訊執行。</p>
<p>第三，該文告對於發展們人自由及推進民主主義政策，亦曾明確指示其必要之揹施：（一），日本國民應充分認識信教自由，不得假借宗教名義作極端國家主義或軍國主義之任何活動；（二）尊重集會自由及言論自由並保護一切民主主義之政黨；（三），撤廢並修正因人種，國籍，信仰，政見等等差別而形成不平等待遇之一切法令；（四），釋放政治犯。</p>
<p>關於經濟方面，該文告（第四部分）強凋日本應走向非軍事性之生產，是故：（一），凡舊有經濟基礎上殘餘軍事力量應首先予以摧毀；（二），嚴禁生產軍事上之任何設施與配備；（三），嚴禁使用海軍艦船及飛機方面生產或修理工作上之任何設備；（四），一切經濟部門均須嚴予監督及管制，以防發生隱蔽的或偽裝的經濟活動；（五），撤廢任何與作戰準備有關之生產部門；（六），嚴禁一切強化戰爭為目的之特定研究；（七），限制新日本重工業之性格及其範圍；（八），限制商船生產，以防其轉變為軍事之用。</p>
<p>其次各要點，均與和平輕濟復興工作有關：（一），凡在民主主義基礎上，組成之工農業團體，應予以鼓勵；（二），摧毀獨佔性的經濟勢力，並消除一切危害和平民主經濟制度之阻力。（三），經濟復興工作，應由日本國民自動負責，尤其對於舊有的經濟制度及其活動方式，應立即澈底改革，使國內經濟趨向和平大道。為達到此項目標，日本政府應實施下述諸項：（1），防免經濟上極度苦難之發生；（2），公正配給一切物資；（3），全部繳出聯合國方面指定為賠償用之物資；（4），促進一切足以饜足日本國民願望之合理和平事業。關於日本賠償問題，該文告特指出：（一）全部繳出日本在海外之資產，由聯合國予以適當分配；（二）立即繳出一切凡足以危害和平而非平時必要之現存物資；（三）立即繳出一切自聯合國方面掠奪而得之資產。</p>
<p>日政府應在盟軍最高司令官監督之下担負管理其國內財政，貨幣及債務各方面之完全責任。同時，日政府在盟軍總部所容許的條件下輸出若干部分貨物，以換取自海外輸入之必要原料。此外，日本在海外之資產以及因投降而損失之資產，不問其為皇室所有，抑為政府所有，應一律造具清冊，呈報盟軍總部查核辦理；對皇室之其他各項措施，亦一秉此項方針執行，以貫澈盟軍佔領之任務。日政府不得對任何一國予以獨佔性的或優先的機會，亦不得假手於產業組織而作上項之活動。</p>
<p>在佔領初期，盟軍對日管制方針大抵已在此文告中列舉無遺，嗣後對日本經濟政治個別問題上，縱有多方面的補充，但在精神上，政策上，始終一貫，並無絲毫背悖，執行方面亦允稱相當順利。無論政治之新設施，或日軍武裝之解除，在此一年半之間，大體均告完成。對於日本戰犯，盟軍總部亦迅即予以處理。至去年一月卅日，盟軍總部頒布遠東國際法庭組織條例，由中美英蘇等十一盟國代表組成審訊機構。關於戰犯審判問題，當俟另篇詳述，茲不贅。在遠東國際法庭組織條例頒布之前，盟軍總部於去年一月四日對所有曾在日政府機構中鼓吹軍國主義之官吏，悉已頒布逮捕令。同時更下令解散一切曾鼓吹軍國主義之國體，計廿七單位。並令日政府凡有軍國主義的指導者，不准担任公職，不准担任貴族院眾譏院議員，縣知事或市長。對於現任官史中有左列各項之一者應即予罷免：</p>
<p>（A）戰犯。（B）職業的陸海軍職者。（C）極端國家主義的團體，暴力主義的團體秘密愛國團體等之有力份子。（D）大政翼贊會翼贊政治會及大日本政治會有關之人物。（E）與侵略戰爭有關之金融機關或開發機關之重要職員。（F）侵佔區之行政長官。（G）其他軍國主義者及極端國家主義者。</p>
<p>十月廿五日又令日政府對駐外使節停止活動。十一月四日又令停止在東京日本政府與中立國間之外交交涉。</p>
<p>去年五月廿三日頒令廢止皇族免稅等特權，對十四家皇族之資產，照法律課稅。</p>
<p>在積極方面，前年十月四日盟軍總部頒佈命令：廢除政治民權及信教自由之各種束縛，並廢除基於人種·國籍·信仰·政見等差別而訂立之各種規定。</p>
<p>在財政經濟方面，盟軍總部於前年九月廿二日發出第三號指令，對今後日本政府應採取之經濟政策之其體要綱，有所指示，其要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）經濟政策之根本，應以確保一般國民最低生活為重點，為保障最低生活，應將國內所有人的物的資源集中於生活必需物資之生產。</p>
<p>（二）關於生活必需物資之配給，政府應實施強力之統制，並保證公正之配給。</p>
<p>在金融管制方面，九月廿二日盟軍總部下令日本政府提供關於各銀行各保險公司及其他金融機關與皇室財政法規有關之全面的金融情報。</p>
<p>去年一月廿四日，為防止通貨膨脹，盟軍總部曾對日政府指示三項原則：（一）政府之支出，應减至最小限度。（二）財政上不足，應以國民貯蓄為填補。（三）不准利用日本銀行及一般銀行作為填補赤字預算之用。</p>
<p>前年十月廿日，下令凍結殖民地各銀行資金，十一月六日，下令凍結四大財閥（即三井·三菱·安田·住友）資產，繼又於十二月十一日對日本財閥支配下之十八家企業公司所屬三百卅六家公司之資金，亦下凍結令。十一月廿五日則頒布戰爭利得稅法令，並停止施行軍人恩俸制。去年六月四日起，又下令限制十大財閥（即鲇川·淺野·川崎·古河·松下·中島·野村·大河內·大倉·　澤）之個人金融活動，效嚴格規定彼輩之家屬生活費。</p>
<p>在貿易方面，前年十一月廿四日，准許米糧·鹽·棉·石油等物輸入，同時煤·絲·蠶種·瀝青·窰木等物列為輸出品。至於勞工法令，亦多所　劃改進。例如：去年十一月十日所頒之　除壓制勞工指令，十二月三日所頒布之救濟失業法令等，均為較顯著而重要之措施。</p>
<p>在經濟制度上，十二月九日對農地制度之改革令，應特為表出，其詳細辦法容後再為叙述。</p>
<p>在督導自由民主和平思想訓練及教育制度上，盟軍總部在此一年半之成就亦不容忽視。其最積極之活動表現於指令方面者，約有：（一）取締軍國主義性質或極端國家主義性質的地理，歷史，修身等各項課目之法令，（一月三日）撤消限制圖書出版之法令（二月廿八日）規定玆於新聞報道自由原則之報紙出版十大條例，（九月廿一日），撤消限新新聞，電彭，通訊之法令，（九月）頒布民主主義再教育方針之指令（十月廿二日），撤廢公娼制度之法令（二月廿四日），廢止日政府以神道教為國教之法令。（十二月十五日）總之，凡此法令之頒發，對於解放日本人民方面確具無限助力，足使日本人民取得發展其個人自由之機動，並享有其過去所渴求之基本人權。以上所述，僅揭示數要點，其詳細的具體內容，自不能在此有限篇幅內盡行列舉，容俟分別詳述。</p>

<h3>民主列車開動了！　（上）</h3>
<p>— 陳顧遠</p>
<p>（一）「吾能發之吾能收之」</p>
<p>國民政府三月三十一日令，公布關於準備行憲之十種法律，這是根據國民大會議決送由國民政府公布之「憲法實施之準備程序」第二條約規定，依限完成的。十種法律中，四種是選舉罷免法，六種是組織法，此外，並有國民大會代表，立法委監員，察委員，各種選舉罷免法施行條例，及國民大會代表，立法委員的各項選舉名額分配表，尚待經過立法程序。這些法律的草擬，是由國防最高委員會本於民主的憲法之精神，決定各種法律的原則，並儘量吸收各黨各派及社會賢達的意見，與學者專家在技術上的貢獻。草案發交立法院後，除立法原則所指示者外，立法工作者費了三週的時間，無星期，無例假，日夜不息地審議研討，求其更適合於民主的表現。不特各黨各派社會賢達與專家共集一堂，爭是辯非，而且一百五十位立法委員約有三分二是國大代表，國民的意見同時也透露出來。為了準備民主列車的開動，各個人都抱了一種極慰快的精神，滌除了身體方面的疲備。尤其在民主的列車準備開動的時候，張故委員鳳九以六十六歲高齡，發言情緒緊張，殉民主而死於議場，不特未使各個人氣沮，日益發激動各個人對於民主的信念，努力推動這一部列車，使其升火出發，向民主的大道駛進！</p>
<p>我們人是制定憲法國民大會的遴選代表中一個，又是在立法院憲法法規委員會初審中一個，既然前後參與其事，所以這十種法律所代表的使命及條文的涵義，比較熟悉；今值各該種法律公布之後，特應本報記者之約，對這一部民主的列車打算作一個簡短的介紹。惟因時間與篇幅的限制，在本文中只能以四種選舉罷免法為其範圍。同昱，我還得先聲明，我不願站在黨派及立法工作者的立場上說話，我極想根據客觀的見解，治學的信條而為述評的。我要說的話是：</p>
<p>四種選舉罷免法不僅在我國為空前的法律，抑且非世界各國普遍所見的法律。世界各國雖皆公認選舉制度，但對罷免制度的採用却非任何國家個個如此。一個公民選出其代表後，倘不能行使罷免，就無法管制代表們的行動；其結果，造成少數當選人的專制，人民除了投票時一剎那間的自由外，永無主權可言，這是舉世學人所詬病的。我們國家是實際地採用罷免制度了，使　選舉制度配合，今後有選舉權的人必會高興地說道：「吾能發之，吾能收之」。在此情形下，每一個公民雖限於事實，不能人人躬自參與中央政事，却已充分表現主權在民的精神。真是值得首先大書而特書者！</p>
<p>再說選舉制度雖不自今日始，但如極力求其符合民主精神而為十足進步的措施，同樣是簇新的規定。國民大會代表立法委員的選舉，既特別標明一選舉手續公開辦理」，又特別標明候選人「公開競選」，且以普通平等直接等原則及無記名單記等方法，標明於各該選舉罷免法之前端。這些，在憲法中原有其規定，然因普通選舉直接選舉比較繁難，就不能不再作注意的規定。其採用單記投票法者，亦係為防止連記投票法易於發生流弊，不得不然。總統副總統是由國民大會選舉，監察委員是由省市議會及　藏地方議會華僑團體之選舉，這是依憲法的規定採取間接選舉。總統副總統雖由人民選出，乃人民的公僕，並不像國民大會代表係代表全民行使政權，也不像立法委員係代表人民行使立法權。既非人民選舉自己的代表，為進行選舉的便利，就不必用直接選舉的辦法。監察委員雖不失為人民的代表，但其要義在代表每一地方集團的人民，相當於各國上議院的議員。故監察委員除出自華僑團體者外均係由人民選出的地方議會的議員選舉之，恰與所謂代表地方的意義相合。因而總統副總統及監察委員兩種選舉罷免法，其性質就很相近，而和國民大會代表及立法委員兩種選舉罷免法自然有其分野的地方。以上是我對四種選舉罷免法之概括觀察。</p>
<p>（二）為保護競選中的弱者設的選舉單位</p>
<p>四種選舉罷免法中，除了總統副總統沒有名額的爭執，監察委員在憲法上已確定其名額分配外，國民大會代表及立法委員的名額分配就很費研討，婦女在監察委員名額中的分配同樣須有解決</p>
<p>國民大會代表共有八項選舉，立法委員共有六項選舉，因內地生活習慣特殊之國民，依憲法第一三五條規定只選出國民代表，而婦女之立法委員名額係分配於各項選舉中，不另由婦女團體選出，所以在立法委員各項選舉中就少了兩個單位。監察委員既係代表地方，於是除僑居國外之國民，因特殊理由僅選出八名監察委員外，各民族在邊疆地區者及職業團體兩個單位亦無。各民族在邊疆地區者係指土著民族而言，散在西南各省，即不能省內有省，由其單獨選出監察委員。</p>
<p>國民大會代表的總名額因各縣市人口的計算尚待求確，但至少為二千九百三十七名，至多亦不過在數目計算上增出數名。行憲的國民大會代表較諸制憲的國民大會代表超過了三分之一，且在其中又减去了制憲時的黨派代表數百名，可說是更按近於民主。倘非受空間的限制，自然是多多益善，這是任何國家所未做到的全民政治之一種表現。立法委員係經常的過問政治，制定法律，人數過多，便難有高的效率；制定憲法時雖沒有通過五百名的定額，但也不應和這個數字相差過遠，立法委員選舉罷免法草案的七百二十八名似乎仍嫌過多，而蒙藏僑胞及各民族在邊疆地區者所分配之名額又嫌過少，於是减其所應减·增其所應增·國民大會代表之各特有單位的選舉或為制憲國民大會前例所限，免強在名額上維持一個比例，立法委員性質有異，憲法上既授權與法律，由其制定各特有單位選舉之名額分配，自然要從民主的精神上為一個合理的數字的決定。幸而監察委員的名額分配憲法上已有規定，就免去了多少爭執。</p>

<h3>放狗的女人</h3>
<p>— 尹雪曼</p>
<p>弟弟爲了要見識見識，所以特地從鄉間跑到上海來，想找點什麼工作。但是這年景，那裹不鬧飢慌呢？自然是工作找不到，也就暫時在我的住處住下來。</p>
<p>我住的這條弄堂，非常闊大和淸靜。因此，不少約有閑階級，每天淸晨傍晚，就在這裹閒碴牙，踱方步。但最能引起我的注意的，還是一個整日牽着一條哈巴狗，無所事事的女人。</p>
<p>這天淸晨，我照例要出去。想不到弟弟却興沖冲地跑來，他彷彿發現什麼大事似的，帶着緊張的神情，說：「哥哥，這裹怎麼有女人放狗呢？」</p>
<p>我一聽，便忍不住笑起來。弟弟是個土氣十足的鄉下人；而在我們家鄉，一向是把「放」字當作「牧」字說的，所以他就認爲那女人是在收狗了。</p>
<p>我說：「你叫她幹什麼呢？她吃飽飯沒事幹呀！」</p>
<p>弟弟這就越發不懂了，他聽了我的話楞了大半天，才再吞吐吐，不好意思地問：「那，她怎麼過呢？</p>
<p>弟弟的意思是說她靠什麼生活呢？我一時却也給他說不淸。便說：「你沒事，正可以把他研究研究，看他怎麼過？」</p>
<p>他點頭答應了。從此，汕似乎也就特別注意起那個女人的起居，行動，和來往出入於她家門的人。過沒好久，他一天晚上便跑來對我說；</p>
<p>「我發現了！我發現了了！她是靠賭錢抽頭吧？」</p>
<p>我說：「也許是，但也許不見得；你可以再看看。」</p>
<p>之後，又過了若干日。他又興冲冲地對我說：</p>
<p>「哥哥，這一决我準能說對了，我已發現她的秘密。」</p>
<p>「你發現了她的秘密？」我故作驚奇地問。</p>
<p>「是的，她的秘密。你相信嗎？我告訴你。」</p>
<p>我又故意搖搖頭，表示不能十分相信。並且還帶點懷疑的口吻說：「怕不準吧？你能發現她的秘密？」</p>
<p>「眞的。」弟弟急得臉都漲紅了。「我跟了她幾個下午，她都是和一兩個男人到跳舞廳去的。只是那些男人們總不是這一兩個人，彷彿隔兩天就換了。我因爲不太注意，所以記不淸。她是靠『賣跳舞』的吧？」</p>
<p>我忍不住又笑起來。一賣跳舞」倒是一個新名詞。他見我笑，馬上便感到不好意思，知道這一次又說錯了。</p>
<p>「眞神秘！她倒底是幹什麼營生的呢？一弟弟不免惆悵起來</p>
<p>我笑過後，便說：「是的，這樣神秘的女人，上海多得很。誰曉得她們幹些什麼營生？」</p>
<p>弟弟望着屋頂，楞住了。這個問題雖然比算術題難於解答，可是却比算術題有趣。因此，那放狗的女人，對他越發具有神秘的誘惑性了。</p>
<p>「我總會發現她的秘密的。」最後，他極有自信地對我說。「反正我沒事，我何妨學學福爾摩斯。」</p>
<p>「好勇氣」。我笑着說；「只是不要成了唐吉訶德式的福爾摩斯」。</p>
<p>「不管怎樣，將來你總要佩服的」。</p>
<p>我說我自然希望唐吉訶德。福爾摩斯，也能有驚人的成功。只是在他成功前，我並不抱多大奢望</p>
<p>很快的過去了？由於忙，我差不　　　　這件事。弟弟呢？他每天似乎都只坐在沙發上看書，從也沒有再向我提起。我不使奇怪他竟不像故事中的福爾摩斯，或唐吉訶德一樣，到處去找綫索，或鬧笑話。而且對他的那份安靜，那份本份，也感到格外的驚疑。</p>
<p>但是，這一天晚上，他忽然從房門外衝進來了。那時我剛從報館回來，正在看晚報上一篇批評時政的文字。但他的神色告訴我，他是遇到了什麼意外的事。因爲他進來後，看見我便怔了一下。他的臉色漲得通紅，甚至限珠也發着紅光。但是他的嘴唇却是蒼白，他的腿有點顫抖。他望着我，彷彿作錯了什麼事，面部透露着內心的恐怖和惶悚。</p>
<p>我讓他靜一靜，才說：「你，怎麼了」？</p>
<p>他們仍是楞楞地望住我，不作聲。</p>
<p>「你遇見了什麼事」？我用眼可住他的臉說。</p>
<p>他聽見我的話，渾身似乎一抖！腿彷彿也不能繼續作强有力的支持，下身一軟，便倒在地上了。</p>
<p>我這時才吃了一驚，趕忙起來把他扶起。這才十八歲的孩子，這時便嗚嗚咽咽地哭了起來。</p>
<p>常我使他恢復安靜後，他說：「哥哥，放狗的女人，會不會來我們這裏」？</p>
<p>「她怎麼會來我們這裏」？我極力安慰他說：「你遇見什麼了」？</p>
<p>「她，那放狗的女人」。弟弟羞愧地望我一下，繼續說：「我這幾天，天天晚上看見她在馬路上，在　堂裏徘徊。她，她每天晚上都帶着一個陌生的男人回去」。</p>
<p>「喚，是嗎」？我說。</p>
<p>「她的狗不過是槐招牌」。這可憐的唐吉訶德。福爾摩斯繼繼着說：「可是那小狗却極利害」！</p>
<p>「它咬了你」？我關切地問</p>
<p>「是的」。他說：「今天晚上這放狗的女人，發現我繼續跟着她，於是，她東拐西拐，我不知不覺便跟她到了她的門口。到門口後，可不由我自主，兩個高個子男人一推一拉，便把我像小鷂似的捉了進去」。</p>
<p>「後來呢」？</p>
<p>「我嚇得大喊救命。可是放狗的女人，却把我抱在懷裏，她向我笑，她吻我的臉，她緊緊的抱住我。她說：『小赤佬，你睡在這裘好嗎』？我拼命掙扎，我說我要走，你放不放？不放我就一直喊救命」！</p>
<p>「她放了你」？</p>
<p>「後來她了我，可是那兩個男人不答應。他們說：『小赤佬，把錢留下！姑娘是白玩的嗎』」？</p>
<p>「那你……」？</p>
<p>他們一邊說一邊就動手，我想反抗也不行。他們把我的錢掏了個精光，一把便把我摔出來了」。</p>
<p>我不禁又笑起來。向他說：「沒摔傷吧」？</p>
<p>「還好，沒有」。他這時搓搓手，撣撣衣褲上的灰，不好意思地望着我說。</p>
<p>「我說你這個福爾摩斯不靈吧，怎樣？到了兒，還是個唐吉訶德」。</p>
<p>他苦笑一下。半天說：「我還是回鄉下去吧」。</p>

<h3>英倫曉春感懷</h3>
<p>— 安紫</p>
<p>苦雪的冬天已經去了，</p>
<p>煤荒和停電將成爲英國歷史上的話柄。</p>
<p>今天有燦爛的陽光，</p>
<p>片片白雲在藍空飄過，</p>
<p>每一小樹枝都挺然而有生氮，</p>
<p>有些已迸出堅決的緣芽。公園的草地是如此鬆濕而柔軟，</p>
<p>融解了的雪水還蘊藏在腐草裏面；</p>
<p>積雪層冰的池塘又微波蕩漾，</p>
<p>鷗島和天鵝都對人說春天來了！</p>
<p>園中的遊女也換上了春裝，</p>
<p>彩色　　像花間舞蝶；</p>
<p>金黃的柔絲在風中　舉，</p>
<p>到處是笑容對此欣欣生意</p>
<p>惟有我心如古井</p>
<p>或許因爲它早已遺留在祖國！</p>
<p>祖國有那樣樸素的自然，</p>
<p>我曾在它的懷裏度過無數甜美的春日。</p>
<p>現在已過榖雨轉瞬就是淸明，</p>
<p>明陸道上想已是繁花如錦？</p>
<p>後湖的垂柳醞釀着碧雲？</p>
<p>雨花台畔誰又在踏靑？</p>
<p>南京孕育了我一切芳春的夢想，</p>
<p>雖然我也曾陶醉於故都的五月和西子的柔情！</p>
<p>桂林的春天邁着匆忙的脚步，</p>
<p>但在那些山巓水涯也留下多少溫馨；</p>
<p>我們在陽朔的舟中俯聽着柔波做夢，</p>
<p>找到了心的歸宿又創造了靑春。</p>
<p>磐溪有紅艷的山茶打破山居的寂寞，</p>
<p>而那水畔的桃花爛熳常新！</p>
<p>我曾帶女兒攀上小山坡午睡，</p>
<p>三月的陽光　被　芳草爲</p>
<p>我注視一處處　谷平原緣陰漸展，</p>
<p>春兩後的嘉陵江幾回黃了又靑！</p>
<p>誠然祖國的一切未免混亂而荒蕪，</p>
<p>但那兒却有不加雕飾的美；</p>
<p>祖國的生涯是如此艱難而近於危險，</p>
<p>但那兒却有更深摯的愛。</p>
<p>我的心生長自祖國的原野，</p>
<p>我愛它了解它如同自己的生命！</p>
<p>我曉得祖國的春天或許到得更　，</p>
<p>但一定更美更　燦更支持得長久，</p>
<p>我是多麼渴望重回到祖國的懷抱，</p>
<p>縱使那兒永久沒有春天！</p>

<h3>恭綽館記</h3>
<p>— 吳保豐</p>
<p>中華民國十年，葉譽虎先生（恭綽）長交通部，爲廣育專門人才計，將交部所屬上海，唐山兩工業專門，北京郵電及交通傳習所四校，合併稱交通大學。由校董會推先生兼任校長。先生以特有之權能，及非凡之學識，高堂遠蹠，拓其始基。復以細針密縷，開誠布公，從事於校務之革新改進。於是各自爲政，不相聯繫之四校，得在同一監督管理之下，增設系科，擴充設備，積極發展，蔚爲最高學府。復以交通人才，匪可閉門合轍，乃訂畢業生分發各交通機關實習辦法。又以各國交通事業日新月異，匪可故步自封，乃規定凡畢業生之成績優異者，槪資送出洋深造。於是本校校友，類皆學騐俱優，人才輩出，長爲國家砥柱。抗戰軍興，交通須與軍事配合，舉凡鐵道，公路，航空，電信建設之主事者，多出本校，而諸校友亦胥能各盡所長，堅苦卓絕，出死入生，以達最後之勝利。飲水思源，何莫非先生宏謨遠略，苦心孤詣，創導之力也。本年四月八日，爲五一周校慶紀念。同人念教思之無窮，軫前程之遠大，於先生深致崇敬，因一致議將工程館改名恭綽館，並範像一區，用垂不朽。保豐夙承獎掖，復忝規隨。謹具小文，藉銘盛典。臨頴不勝仰止，是爲記。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血311</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「是，隊長，」正岩限神一亮，似乎有了發見了，「不敢動問隊長，這一次不是有很重大的使命南來的嗎？」</p>
<p>「對！」</p>
<p>「可是發動工作？」正岩有些斯斯艾艾地；因這是上司的秘密。</p>
<p>「對發動工作的發動工作…我和萍子小姐，另有合作的事。」</p>
<p>「部下委是可能知道一點內容的話……這是說，隊長和萍……中村小姐合作的內容，也許能想得出一點這理來；『旁觀者淸，』的意思……」</p>
<p>「這也對…」鶴見剛要把秘密使命的話，告訴正岩，下女又一次的出現了。</p>
<p>「小姐坐的那部車子，現在查明了；倒是在車行裹面停着。可是那個車夫，十點半鐘，已經下值，回家去了；要到下午四點　上値。我們這裹的管事，因爲老爺指定要這車夫，呌車行經理人設法，經理答應差人上車夫家去，派他特別淪值，大的十二點鐘，可以駕車來了。管事人說，請老爺原諒，他辦事太不過到了。」</p>
<p>「哦，很好，很好。你替我道謝責管事人，我太麻煩他了。反正現在已經經……　　見瞧了瞧手錢，「已經十一多了，我們可以等到十二點……請你拿幾瓶　魯，帶幾樣食品來……」鶴兒對下女說話，有些過分客氣。</p>
<p>十分鐘之聞，正岩元自拿着那張怪字條和那封信箋，細心研究。鶴見已經脫去了和服，穿上了便　，仍舊是那一套夏季西　，所要的啤酒和食品　端端正正放在桌上了。下女本來要在房裹伺候，鶴見說「沒有需要，」把下文打發出去了。</p>
<p>這兩個　年，因在國外工作，　　坐的習慣，早已弄得不習慣了。他們就　四式小圓桌，一面飲食，一面促膝密談起來</p>
<p>首先由鶴見把這次南來的秘密，很仔細的告訴了正岩；並說明了時間因素的重要性！「今日三十，已經過去半日了，必須在明日日落之前，把事辦出效果來！」！同時又說明，一切辦法，萍子沒有發表；「自己是個被動；」聽萍子口氣，連她自己也還沒有知道。</p>
<p>「我想一切關鍵，大槪都在這封信上。」鶴見指着大使館送來的那封公事文件。「我預備最晚到下午四點，萍子如再不回來，我就得折開這信了。」鶴見把那封信件，愼重地藏在自己的行囊裏。</p>
<p>「是的，爲了大事，當然不能顧惜這些小節。」正岩指着鶴見預備　閱他人信件的人格觀而說。「隊長是不是需要我那位朋友參加呢？」正岩第二度提出了他的朋友。</p>
<p>「這正是我急於要打聽的。」鶴見極度誠懇地發表了他的意見。</p>
<p>正岩於是把自已所知道，關於這個朋友的事，說明出來。……</p>
<h3>東京羅曼斯</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>胖胖的，二十九歲霍白雷區德（Earnest　Hoberecht），美國合衆通訊社東京分社的主任，現在是日本人最歡迎的作家了。</p>
<p>霍白雷匾德是「一物成名」的，這一物使他賺了八萬美元！</p>
<p>事情是這樣的。有一天，他到日本的松竹電影公司的攝影塲去採訪新聞。等他趕到的時候，剛日女明星三村平子在對公司當局撒嬌，要求改寫劇本——因爲這劇本　要她表演一個接吻鏡頭，而三村小姐在她芳　二十六年之中，還從朱有過接吻的經騐。</p>
<p>霍白雷匾德在旁邊一看有搜可乘，立刻就告訴三村小姐和旁邊的許多公司職員說：麥帥曾經表示過，電影上的接吻鏡頭可以有助於民主精神。接着，他就對美麗的三村說，他極願敎她怎樣表演接吻。</p>
<p>結果，他就果斷地實行了他促進民主的任務——他吻了她。</p>
<p>三村小姐似乎有點眩暈。停了一下，她突然回身，跑到了化妝室去。</p>
<p>一個茶房拿了一張三村小姐寫的字條出來。這張字條是給霍白雷區德的，她寫着；「旣有今日之事，今後願母再相見。」</p>
<p>事情的發展，似乎並不似霍白雷區德所預料。但是，霍白雷區德却也交到了事前從朱料到的好運。原來他的「民主敎育」已經成爲全日本的「佳話」，全日本的報紙都登載着這件大事！</p>
<p>霍白雷區德成爲全日本婦孺咸知的紅人，書店裏向他接洽稿件，雜誌編輯請他寫文章。結果，在二個月之後，出版了霍白雷區德的第一部小說：「東京羅曼斯」，這本書立刻就譯成日文，初版十萬本，不到兩星期就全部賣元，成爲日本戰後第一部暢銷書。這部小說的主要故事是講一個美國記者如何追求一位日本女明屋，結果終於追求到手。霍白雷區德自己承認，這本書裏的男主角實在是他自己。</p>
<p>「東京羅曼斯」使他賺到了日金一百二十萬圓，如照美軍匯率算起來，相當於美金八萬元左右。霍白雷區德的文思大來，一本本的新著出版了：「東京日記」，「美國五十名人傳」，「民主禮儀」，……每一本都生意興隆。現在，他每天自早晨八點半到下午五點半是合衆社記者，採訪新聞，拍電報，五點半之後，他就以大作家姿態出現：寫着，寫着，不斷地寫　。</p>
<h3>自己充滿原始氣息反蔑視中國式生活　日本民族性之一</h3>
<p>— 窗</p>
<p>前幾時在街頭書攤上，偶然尋到一本東京日日新聞社輯印的題名呌「中國人」的英譯本，看樣子大概是他們戰爭期間對國外作宣傳用的，祗可惜缺頁太多，沒有把它購下。不過這裏面有很多非常風趣的材料：譬如說他們對我們中國式生活常表示驚異與費解，特別是吃飯和沐浴兩件事，那麼浪費，那麼不講衛生；其實這種批判正是說明了日本民族在智慧上的執拗。我們吃飯注重調味，以健飯爲幸福，但是日本人固定的菜肴祇是兩片鹹蘿蔔，幾條小魚，飯量要加限制，說是適合營養而又有益消化；沐洛也是如此，一隻方木箱裏滿放了熱水，讓一家人依序浸上半小時，好像異常文明，但是長幼尊與在這個時候可以光着身子怡然相對，則又充滿了一種原始的野蠻氣息，這並不比我們每天進浴室而擦背的總能够在身上推出很多汚垢來（道是原書所驚異的）更覺雅觀些。至於穿「和服」，睡「榻榻米」，在旁人認爲毫無美感和舒適可言的，他們却硬要强調作自我的肯定與讚揚，甚至從不考電到這些事物的改革與進化，這就是日本的民族性。</p>

<p>在這一種所謂趣味制度送入歷史博物館以前，談談藝妓的現狀，倒是一件不乏興味的事。在目前，日本的生活程度相當的高，靠所謂色藝度日，終究並非易事，藝妓自亦不例外。她們平均收入，每月不過日金五千元。區區此數，拿來開銷伙食和衣飾，已經頗感捉襟見肘。平日所穿和服，大抵購自黑市，每件最起碼的也得化上日金三千元；換過來說，就得化掉全部汗血錢的六分之一。濃抹艷粧，在她們的習慣上簡直是一筆資本，沒有這筆資本，就做不了生意經，所以她們對於化裝用的脂粉和假髮，雖然黑市裹面也斷檔，價格一再騰漲，貴得嚇人，她們也還是非設法購備不可。可知賣笑生涯，在日本也只好苦吃苦做了。</p>
<p>賣突生涯的困難，並不始於今日，似不妨遠溯到珍珠港事件爆發之後，那時日本軍閥早就爲了「撙節人力物力」，限制着軍民的生活享受，大多數藝妓院就因此受到犧牲，「關門大吉」，往後，美機B-29型大舉飛襲東京，藝妓薈萃的繁華區域首當其衝，先後夷爲平地。藝妓一看情勢不對，便相繼改業，或竟宣告失業，返鄉吃老米飯去。</p>
<p>其後，美軍佔領日本了，這時期曾一度出現過戰後的畸形繁榮。日本商人和官吏，倦勤之餘，腰纏萬貫，無法發洩，便陶然地投入藝妓的懷抱，企圖消滅其自身的煩怨，聆歌買笑，尋歡消愁，千金一擲，毫無吝色。美軍魅惑於異國的情調，爲了滿足藝妓的好奇心，博取其歡心，更是以大量的美鈔權充「獻金」。</p>
<p>笑者自笑，哭者自哭。藝妓協會（藝妓本身組織的工會）認爲美軍與藝妓，厮混得火樣的親嫟，似乎有碍觀瞻，於是訂立了一條公約：只許在餐廳裏招待美軍，不許在餐應以外的任何房間內允，其不許表示媚態。自比以後，美軍不再是「入幕之賓」，而僅僅是藝妓院裏的「參觀者」了。按：「參觀者」一語，係借用日本藝妓對美軍之別稱；並非筆者獨創的名字。</p>
<p>戰時柬京一帶曾發展到藝奴一萬人光景，如今只剩了十分之一，而且還在逐步减少。</p>
<p>現在，麥帥總部解放藝妓的指令已經頒佈，對於妓院主人不啻是開了一陣的大砲。雖然藝妓們在今日之下還在民主繁榮的條件下賺錢過日子，但這種日子畢竟是有限的了。如果麥帥指令眞能肅淸藝妓制度，則日本全體被解放了的主婦們勢將繼藝妓之後担任她們的傳統的招待工作。</p>
<h3>與日本賽跑</h3>
<p>— 馬其</p>
<p>當我們在鬧着深重的經濟危機之日，却見報載若干國家齊向日本表示願與恢復國際貿易的消息。一經尋思，不禁感慨萬千。</p>
<p>日本爬起得好快！投降迄今，不過一年半時光，已經元氣大復，戰敗的狼狽情景，亦不復見於今日；國泰民安，外國自然樂與重建經濟的關係。這是日本戰後新生的徵象，可無疑義。</p>
<p>回溯勝利前夕，各幽無不確認中國將成戰後亞洲最具安定力量的國家，亞洲經濟生活的繁榮發展，必以中國爲其起點與動力。詎知時至今日，中國還是戰亂相承，險象環生，自顧不暇，遑論領導亞洲各國共趨繁榮？國內沒有安定的經濟生活，正常的國際貿易自然也無從談起。所以通被我們打敗的日本所受的「光寵」，也還受不到，眞是不暇自哀了。</p>
<p>不必妒羡日本，也不必怕，我們從前旣已努力打倒了日本的侵略主義，則日本人民今後的生活，正需扶助其改善，本諸己立立人之義，改造日本，我們應當與有力焉。問題是我們需要猛力前進，不然，落在日本人後邊，是臉都沒處放的　。</p>
<h3>日軍猶在抵抗</h3>
<p>— 韋榮</p>
<p>珍珠港合衆社報道一則消息，說在太平洋上貝葉留皇的洞穴內，尚有少數日軍匿跡其中，反抗美國海軍陸戰隊之肅淸運動。這些日軍至今以為美軍不過佔領了「巴勞斯」而已，整個日本，尚在繼續作戰。這個消息使我們覺得太平洋作戰區城的龐大，以及荒山野爲的遍及。同時，它也使我們覺得好笑；正如民國成立已經數十年，忽然看見一個人還拖着辮子，把　儀稱爲皇上，日夜期待着復辟一樣令人好笑。</p>
<p>這件事在日軍自己自然不是笑料。不但他們不覺得好笑，連日本國內的朝野，儘管在麥帥督導之下彷彿已經大澈大悟，也不會覺得好笑。他們的心目中，一定把這些負嵎頑抗的分子還當作英雄看待。因爲這種反抗的心理，決不單單存在於洞穴內的頑抗分子，同樣也潛伏在大多數日本人的血液事面。他們看見這一條消息，在情緒上發生的是共鳴，決不是好笑。</p>
<p>還有從事肅淸運動的美國海軍陸戰隊，恐怕也沒有發笑的可能，日軍躱在山洞裹面，隨時出來突襲，偶而也能造成對於治安和生命的威脅，海軍陸戰隊在這假島上還沒有看見敵人投降，戰爭狀態依然存在，他們一面從事肅淸，一面就必須相當地戒備，這種心境自然也決不輕鬆。</p>
<p>唯一覺得好笑的大槪祇是我們這些以爲天下已經太平而『篤篤定定』打算坐享太平的人了，正如「貧」「病」「愚」「私」四大敵人猶在作祟的時候，我們却滿不在乎，聽任猖獗一樣。正如封建餘毒，軍閥遣　猶在擾亂秩序，破壞治安的時候，我們却陶醉在四强之一的榮耀裏面。</p>
<h3>日本傳統的人性</h3>
<p>— 方田</p>
<p>日本民族在科學上曾經窮思竭應的模仿西洋，藝術部門也並不例外，惟有歌舞劇則非常奇怪，他們接受了西洋歌舞中任何一種新型的設計與表現，而獨把暴露性感的「擺臀舞」（即普通所謂「草裙舞」的道一類東西）完全放棄，他們的理由很簡單：這種舞蹈原是土著民族對性行爲的極原始的表現，猥褻而又殘酷，人類是不應也不能把它加以公開的；因此日本人儘可讓女性的肉體在公共浴室裏毫無掩飾的暴露，儘可讓男性在種種便利下取得性行爲的滿足，但是他們始終否認一般藝妓舞姬能够卸下「和服」而改川乳罩與三角褲的合法權利。他們的　褻是唯心的，而殘酷却是潛在的，從這裏我們又可以發見到日本民族思想上的固執與低能。</p>
<p>上面這些事實雖簡單，但確是日本民族性的永恒，在日本歷史上，尤其可以看到不斷的記載着他們那些「英雄志士」捨棄生命甚至國運來維護這個永恒的事實。現在試騐的日子到了，Lire上面不是常常刋着：日本男性在細黨，要求民主，日本女性也在以接近美軍士兵爲榮嗎？不過他們那些埋藏在傳統專面的人性的眞實，感情的善良，是否就可以從此被解放出來呢？我們期待着事實的答覆！（日本民族性之二）</p>
<h3>「八十三年非」</h3>
<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>日本老作家之懺悔</p>
<p>大批日本戰犯逮捕令，像大雷雨一樣打在殘葉一樣的五十九人的頭上。日本軍閥，政客，財閥，文閥之流，都在爲着自身的運命而發抖。當時，曾經以「不如歸」那齣名劇享有盛名的老作家德富蘇峯，（又名廬花，八十三歲）正在熱海伊豆山草堂中療養宿疾，聽到這一陣霹靂，突然提起筆來，在二十個字的五言絕句裏寄托着他的一片感懷，悔禍之情，亦同時洋溢於字裏行間。詩如下：</p>
<p>「血淚爲誰揮？丹心白首違。</p>
<p>滄桑轉瞬變，八十三年非！」</p>
<h3>櫻花</h3>
<p>— 羅綺</p>
<p>櫻花的顏色和形狀很像桃花，剛開時看不見葉，所以又像梅花。當櫻花盛開的時節，也正是人們被春光爛醉了的時候，日本把櫻花常作國花，把它的突然一齊開放炫耀一時而後又突然的凋謝來比喻成功一時。但是生命不久的武士，蔣百里先生也曾這樣錨寫過：「花是櫻花，人是武士，多美呵，但也太悽慘了。」日本確是喜歡櫻花的民族，每年都有一次舉國狂歡的櫻花節日。</p>
<p>在異邦人們的印象中，除了感到含有一些悲觀情調外，更有趣的是，很多人說，櫻花十足的代表了日本人的性格，也代表了日本出產的貨品，經看可不經用，像日本島上的女人，年輕時風姿美麗，但稍經年月，就變得臃腫難看了。櫻花更象徵了日本的國運，突然的興起，却又難以長久昌隆。</p>
<p>櫻花在日本人的心目中有特殊的癖好，如今「世換時移」。當櫻花又臨盛開的季節，扶桑島國的人們，不知道又作如何想法</p>
<h3>三件「法寶」　——東洋鏡的拆穿</h3>
<p>— 墨郎</p>
<p>「東洋鏡」在劃時代的大戰爭中終於被拆穿了。自命爲「天神之國」的日本，迷信的程度在全世界可說是無出其右，但實際上與其說它是拜神，寗願說它是拜物來得更眞切。神權，皇權，物權，簡直就是一種東西，化了三個名稱而已。日皇登基，據說是除了借助於神木身之外還得借助於神物。所謂神物，即三件法寳：第一件是據說能用以照射殺敵人的藏在白緞黑匣裹，連日皇自己都不得啓視的一面鏡子；第二件是類似我國的念珠的用寳石串成的項飾；第三件是早已在古代日本戰爭中遺失了的寳劍。</p>
<p>這三件法寳埋在神宮裏，永遠原封不動。每一代的日皇便只得挾了僞造的鏡子，項飾和寳劍，前去登基，老百姓們不知底蘊，居然像煞有介事的尊之爲皇，同時又把僞造的東西信以爲眞；你想東洋鏡拆穿了，豈不是成了假法寳和假皇帝了嗎？</p>
<h3>幸福的日本孩子</h3>
<p>— 李水</p>
<p>看了此次應麥帥邀請赴日觀光的記者們已發表的遊日觀感，深慶日本的孩子們是幸福的。若與被稱領導世界的五强之一的中國孩子比較，那眞是，不勝汗顏之至。</p>
<p>第一，日本孩子們的衣服，雖無豪華氣，卻一概有潔。</p>
<p>第二，日本雖然粳食恐慌，但大人們都能　節，寗可自己吃不飽，而孩子們是必須儘量吃飽的，所以各處的小學生，皆長得肥碩可愛。</p>
<p>第三，日本的國會，已通過將義務敎育由六年延長爲九年，就是說此後日本的孩子，無論男女貧富，皆可以修到和我們初中畢業相等的學業。</p>
<p>日本的孩子們，不愁穿，不愁吃，不愁無書讀。凡孩子們應該有的幸福，他們都有了，回顧我們中國的孩子們，怎不能令人悵惘嘆息！</p>
<h3>日本的新暴發戶</h3>
<p>— 溪</p>
<p>在今日的日本國內，仍有無數小市民靠着有限的配給食糧勉維生活，而一般新暴發戶却每夜在東京的餐館　　　揮金如土，過着紙醉金迷的生活。</p>
<p>這輩新暴發戶大都積有未經凍結的大　現款。據東京市警察局的統計，他們所涉足的酒樓　產和其仙娛樂塲所凡二萬四千二百八十餘家。這些銷金窟往往　　　斷垣殘壁的廢墟上，和飢寒交迫的貧民窟爲隣，大有「朱門酒內臭，路有凍屍骨」之槪。</p>
<p>從道些娛樂塲所的老聞的談話裏，可以想見這　　客的手面闊綽，他們對於下女和舞　往往一　鉅萬，毫無吝色。</p>
<p>某老　說：「我們的這些主顧不像從前那樣是上流社會的中人物，但是他們有的是錢，我們爲了維持營業起見，不得不迎合他們的口味。」</p>
<p>警察局依據官價估計每夜在娛榮塲所　　　　　物總計一六·三一三·七〇〇日元。但因酒類和各種菜餚大都購自黑市，故實際上當數倍於此數。至於這輩豪客每夜賞賜給下女舞孃們的「貼補」（Tip）平均在一萬萬日元以上。</p>
<p>這輩暴發戶據說大都是日用品的大囤戶，　脫售囤貨而獲鉅利。</p>
<h3>從日皇的新詩談起</h3>
<p>— 陳家驊</p>
<p>不久前日皇昭和做了一首新詩，據說這是應宮內舉行一個唱詩會而作的。</p>
<p>「人們會愛那人似的靑松的，</p>
<p>在大雪下不變靑靑之色——」</p>
<p>以上二行，是他詩中的詞句，這一種優美靑麗的色彩，因而許多人均讚揚日皇的藝術天才了。</p>
<p>但這是一種很膚淺的看法。</p>
<p>自然我們從藝術的觀點，去欣賞這首小詩的話，對作者日皇的文學造詣—至少對這首詩的成功，必竟値得　佩的。</p>
<p>文學是苦悶的象徵，尤其詩，她是「飽含情緒的技巧的語言」（艾靑）。所以，我們從這觀點去研究這首新詩的話，便會發現這是日皇含有敎育及警惕意味而發洩出來的心聲，絕不能以「詩」去欣賞牠的。</p>
<p>日本民族有一種野蠻及狡詐的性格，强悍的大和民族，是他們引以爲榮的。雖然現在戰敗了，思想單純的「臣民」，還未了其大帝國的圓滿好夢。</p>
<p>早就有人說過，現在日人對麥帥道種唯命是聽的樣子，不過是一種方式，爲了適應環境吧了！</p>
<p>這樣，如果以這種角度去看日皇所作的這首新詩的話，毫無疑議的，我們便爲了解這是一首日皇反抗的宣言。在這首詩中，很明顯的，日皇自比爲一棵靑松，他的意思是：日本（皇）雖受着壓迫，但並不會屈服的。</p>
<p>日本還沒有馴服，所謂「民主」，不過是他們政治上的一種裝飾，對盟國的一種欺騙與應付兇殘的日閥，並未削减其實力，潛代着，躍躍欲試呢！而且他們已在作恢復「大日本帝國」的準備工作了。</p>
<p>你相信澀谷事件，同黃浦江的　　旗，沒有政治陰謀嗎。</p>

<h3>Future Policy for Governing Taiwan: Minister Bai Proposes Six Recommendations, Chen Yi to Leave Taiwan for Nanjing to Report on His Duties</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi stated in a press conference at the Central Propaganda Department at 3:30 PM on the 7th that the administrative system of Taiwan has been decided to be changed to a regular provincial system, and personnel matters will be announced after the Chairman returns to Nanjing. Minister Bai first gave a detailed report on the causes of the Taiwan incident and the measures to be taken for its aftermath, dividing them into distant and recent causes. The distant cause was attributed to the fifty years of history under Japanese rule, which deeply influenced the education, society, and economy of the Taiwanese people. The recent causes were mainly the trade monopoly system, the bureaucratic administrative system, and Communist elements. He also explained his six recommendations. When reporters inquired whether these recommendations would be adopted by the government, Minister Bai stated that some of the recommendations were instructions from the Chairman, and some were based on actual observations, so they were generally adoptable, and a decision could be made after the Chairman returned to Nanjing. Furthermore, the number of firearms seized by rioters during the incident was as follows: 4,800 hand grenades, 3,000 rifles, and 90 pistols, but many have been returned. Regarding the inquiry about the alleged retaliation by Chen Yi against the Taiwanese people during the incident, Minister Bai stated that he had not seen any retaliation, and that government troops were responsible for protecting the people and would never retaliate. Finally, he stated that he could responsibly say that the incident was caused by a small number of Communist elements and political opportunists taking advantage of the local people's dissatisfaction with the current situation as a fuse, and that the vast majority of Taiwanese people did not agree with this. He hoped that such an incident would not happen again in the future. Taiwan is a national defense fortress and a revolutionary base for the nation. Its patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit are worthy of emulation, and he believed that it could be stabilized. There was no need to send more troops to Taiwan, and there was only one division of troops there, which had been decided to be sent before the incident. The future governance of Taiwan would not rely on force, but on politics and economics. He also stated that the forty Taiwanese people currently hiding in the Central Mountain Range were led by Xie Xuehong, a female Communist Party member.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Office, 7th] Taiwan Administrative Governor Chen Yi will leave for Nanjing within days to report on his duties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Central Memorial Week was held at the National Government House at 9:00 AM on the 7th, presided over by President Ju, with formalities observed. Minister Bai reported on his visit to Taiwan to offer condolences. Minister Bai analyzed in detail the distant and recent causes of the February 28th Incident in Taiwan. At the same time, he also explained the central government's handling of the situation and the recommendations he made to the central government after his visit. It was stated that Taiwan has now returned to normal. The recommendations he made for handling the incident were: (1) After the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office is changed to a provincial government, deputy heads should be added to each department and bureau, to be filled by Taiwanese compatriots. The number of provincial government committee members should be increased from eleven to fifteen, to recruit Taiwanese talent as much as possible. County and city governments should, in principle, be elected by Taiwanese compatriots. (2) In terms of economics, local heavy industries should be jointly operated by the central government or the central government and the Taiwan province, while light industries should be opened up as much as possible, and Taiwanese compatriots should have the priority to undertake them. (3) All arable land in Taiwan Province should be leased to farmers by the provincial government for use. (4) The Monopoly and Trade Bureaus should be abolished. (5) Before the central government has completely reorganized the currency system, the Taiwan currency should still be maintained, but the exchange rate with the legal tender should be appropriately increased. (6) A Taiwan Supervisory Envoy Office should be established to rectify officialdom and eliminate corruption.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Minister Bai's Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Minister Bai Chongxi reported on the causes of the Taiwan Incident and the measures for its aftermath at the Central Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 7th. The original text is as follows: I, Chongxi, was ordered to visit Taiwan to offer condolences. I flew from Nanjing to Taiwan on the 17th of last month and returned to Nanjing on the 2nd of this month, staying in Taiwan for half a month. I followed the central government's spirit of magnanimity and guiding principles to handle the aftermath of the incident. Regarding the causes of this incident and the follow-up measures, I have stated them in various broadcasts while in Taiwan. Newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have mostly published them. All the contents are based on actual observations and opinions expressed by officials and civilians in Taiwan, such as representatives of county and city public opinion organs in Taiwan, local dignitaries Lin Xiantang, Qiu Niantai, Huang Chaoqin, Nan Shouxin, etc., and reports from military and political leaders in Taiwan. Today, I have been ordered to attend the Memorial Week to report, and I would like to present a summary:</p>
<p>A. Distant Causes of the Taiwan Incident</p>
<p>Regarding education, the Taiwanese people have been ruled by Japan for as long as 51 years and were forced to learn Japanese. At that time, the ambition of the Japanese ruling class was not only to turn Taiwan into Japan's Taiwan, but also to turn the Taiwanese people into Japanese citizens. They did everything possible to divide them, and tried their best to slander the Chinese government, people, and army, in order to create a bad impression on the Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese people were under the high pressure of the Japanese military and police for a long time. Although most of them still understood the great righteousness, a few inevitably felt alienated from the language of the motherland, and their access to information about the situation in the motherland was blocked. As a result, they lacked a proper understanding of the government and army of the motherland.</p>
<p>Regarding society, in the past, Japan ruled Taiwan and gave special training to unemployed hooligans, turning them into hawks and dogs for invading the motherland, or driving the hooligans to Green Island of Taiwan and imprisoning them for life. After the restoration, these hooligans returned to their homeland, and their habits were difficult to change, becoming troublemakers. Regarding economics, Taiwan has been developed and operated by Japan for more than 50 years in the past, and its industrial and mining construction is of considerable scale. Over the years, the amount of food resources that the Japanese mainland took from Taiwan was enormous. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to military influence, industry and commerce have gradually declined, and people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult. After the restoration, more than 100,000 Taiwanese men who were conscripted by Japan during the war were sent back one after another, forming a serious unemployment situation, which was also a cause of potential unrest.</p>
<p>B. Recent Causes of the Taiwan Incident</p>
<p>Regarding economics, Taiwan's economy has always been closely linked to Japan's economy. Taiwan produces raw materials and semi-finished products, while Japan produces finished products. For example, rice and sugar are the main products of Taiwan. The reason why Taiwan's rice and sugar production is so abundant is entirely due to chemical fertilizers, which are supplied by Japan. After Japan's defeat, industry stagnated, and there was no surplus fertilizer to supply Taiwan. According to Taiwan Province, the total annual demand for chemical fertilizers is about 250,000 tons, and the factories in Taiwan Province can only produce 50,000 tons per year, with a large gap between supply and demand. After searching around the world, only a small amount was obtained, which greatly affected rice and sugar production. After the victory, Taiwan's economy can be said to be completely disconnected, and the original factories have not been completely restored, and there are many unemployed workers. Under this situation, people's dissatisfaction with the status quo is self-evident, just like the people in the mainland, after eight years of the War of Resistance, people's livelihood is exhausted, and they often have fierce criticism of the government, which is almost an unavoidable fact. The adjustment of this economic situation will take some time, and it cannot be achieved overnight.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Trade and Monopoly Bureaus has a huge annual income of more than 2 billion Taiwan dollars, accounting for one-half of the total budget of Taiwan Province in the 36th year. Although the government's finances have been supplemented, the scope of control of the Trade Bureau is too wide, and the scope of private industry and commerce is becoming narrower, which makes people's livelihood difficult and increases unemployment. Regarding administration, at the beginning of Taiwan's restoration, the people were excited, and they all regarded returning to the motherland and obtaining equal freedom with compatriots in other provinces as an honor. After the administrative organization of Taiwan Province was announced, they felt that the power of the Administrative Governor and the Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison was similar to that of the Japanese Governor-General. At first, they thought that it was just the beginning of the takeover, and that there would be changes later. The people of Taiwan were very enthusiastic in their support for the government, but although many administrative personnel at all levels were humble and capable, inferior ones were inevitable. In particular, too few Taiwanese were appointed as senior officials in provinces, cities, and counties. For example, among the eight directors and deputy directors of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office, there was only one Taiwanese deputy director. Among the eight counties and nine cities in the province, there were only two Taiwanese county and city mayors, which was something that the people of Taiwan were very dissatisfied with. The incitement of Communist elements: Since the victory of the War of Resistance, speech and association have been extremely free. The domestic Communists took this opportunity to slander the government and the National Army, distort the facts, and make various malicious propaganda. After the restoration of Taiwan, the administrative authorities in Taiwan Province also supported democracy in politics, and public opinion organs were established in all counties and cities, and freedom of speech was allowed. The Communist Party and a few ambitious people took the opportunity to slander the local government and provoke the antagonism between the Taiwanese people and the public education personnel serving in Taiwan from the mainland, which was the same as the domestic Communist Party, and the impact was that the source of the chaos was born.</p>
<p>To sum up the above reasons, all are the origins of the incident. A small number of Communist elements and ambitious people, thugs, and rogues used the cracking down on cigarette vendors by the Monopoly Bureau's anti-smuggling personnel as a fuse, incited and coerced, and a part of young students and Taiwanese compatriots followed blindly. Taking advantage of the transfer of the National Army, they expanded the riot. The ambition of these few reactionaries was by no means out of simple dissatisfaction with the status quo, but to attempt to subvert the government and seize power. Since the February 28th Incident broke out, it spread throughout Taiwan in a few days. The so-called "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" even put forward unreasonable thirty-two conditions, demanding that the National Army hand over its weapons and take over government agencies and warehouse materials. At the same time, the rioters besieged the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office, the Garrison Command Headquarters, and attacked Keelung, Kaohsiung, and other key air force bases and military supply warehouses. The illegal acts showed fully proved their attempt to overthrow the government and seize power. In addition, they beat, insulted, injured, or robbed the public education personnel and their families who were sent to Taiwan from the mainland to assist in Taiwan's construction and educate Taiwan's children. These public education personnel were not only threatened mentally and suffered material losses, but even lost their lives. This kind of xenophobic action was only slightly curbed when the reorganized 21st Division and the Military Police were transferred to Taiwan to increase defense. After the Taiwan incident, based on my personal observations in Taiwan and consulting opinions from all parties in Taiwan Province, Chongxi believes that the political and economic systems of Taiwan Province must be reformed as soon as possible, and personnel must be adjusted as soon as possible. I have now prepared recommendations and submitted them to the Chairman for review and implementation. In principle:</p>
<p>In terms of politics, the current Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office will be changed to a provincial government system. In order to adapt to the environment, the number of provincial government members will be slightly increased, and deputy positions will be added to each department and bureau of the provincial government.</p>
<p>In terms of economics, (1) According to the central government's regulations, heavy industries in Taiwan Province should be state-owned or jointly operated by the province and the central government, while light industries should be opened up as much as possible and encouraged to be privately operated, and the principle should be to allow Taiwanese people to raise funds to operate them as much as possible, and to avoid being monopolized or manipulated by a small number of capitalists inside and outside Taiwan Province. (2) 70% of the public land (including mountainous areas) in Taiwan Province occupies 70% of the province. Those who can be cultivated should be implemented in accordance with the central government's approved regulations on the lease of public land in Taiwan Province, and public land should be distributed to Taiwanese people with the ability to cultivate it, in order to enrich the people's livelihood and relieve unemployed compatriots. (3) The monopoly system: According to the current monopoly items, there are four types of cigarettes, alcohol, camphor, and matches. It is decided to reduce the scope of the monopoly, and it is planned to abolish the Monopoly Bureau and set up a Cigarette and Alcohol Public Sales Bureau. (4) It is planned to abolish the Trade Bureau immediately and change it to an organization that supplies materials, only managing the export of provincial industrial finished products and the procurement of machine raw materials, and it can also accept entrustment from private industries to handle the above-mentioned business.</p>
<p>In terms of personnel, too few Taiwanese people have been appointed in the past. In the future, the responsible officials of the provincial, county, and municipal governments in Taiwan Province should give priority to selecting Taiwanese talents as a principle.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the history of governance and eliminate corruption, it is recommended that the Control Yuan establish a Supervisory Envoy Office in Taiwan to be solely responsible for the task, so as to fully exercise supervisory powers and establish a clean and honest political style.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be explained that the number of casualties in this incident, according to the report of the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters, is as follows: Among military and police personnel, 14 officers and 74 soldiers died, 108 officers and 218 soldiers were injured, and 2 officers and 24 soldiers were missing, totaling 440 officers and soldiers injured, killed, and missing. Among public education personnel and rioting people in various counties and cities, 304 died and 1,556 were injured, totaling 1,860 injured and killed. The above figures are up to March 31. (End)</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Tells Reporters: Never Ordered Closure of Newspapers</h3>
<p>Denies Powell's Remarks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi denied at a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Central Propaganda Department on the 7th the statement in an article by Powell published in the China Weekly Review on April 5 regarding the Taiwan incident that "Chongxi ordered the closure of newspapers after visiting Taiwan to offer condolences." He said: I did not order the closure of newspapers during my visit to Taiwan, and I have never done so in my life. Minister Bai then made a responsible statement to Chinese and foreign reporters that the occurrence of the Taiwan incident was entirely due to a small number of Communists and ambitious people in Taiwan who were dissatisfied with the status quo and used anti-smuggling as a fuse to incite and agitate. In fact, the vast majority of Taiwanese people do not agree with this. During my visit to Taiwan to offer condolences, the persons in charge of several local public opinion organs and gods expressed their regret for the unfortunate incident and hoped that I would express this to Chairman Chiang and the people of the whole country after returning to Nanjing. Minister Bai concluded by saying that the central government will strive for political, economic, and educational reforms in Taiwan in the future, because Taiwan is not only a revolutionary base, but also a military base.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Petition Representatives Prepare to Write to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Taiwanese representatives petitioning in Nanjing and Shanghai, Zhao Jia, have decided to submit a request to the Chairman when he returns to Nanjing, asking for the release of Taiwanese gentry arrested and transferred to the Security Bureau of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics for investigation and handling. Also, Yang et al. have appealed to the Senate, hoping that the Senate can form an investigation committee to investigate the truth of the matter.</p>
<h3>Northern Shaanxi Oil Mine Enters National Army Control</h3>

<h3>Negotiations on Dalian Issue Concluded, We Decide to Implement Military Takeover, Sino-Soviet Pulandian Talks Quite Harmonious</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 7th Dispatch] According to the relevant side, negotiations on receiving Dalian through diplomatic channels have now come to an end. The Soviet side declared that the Soviet troops in Dalian have withdrawn to Lushun, but it is not yet known whether they have actually withdrawn. The government has decided to implement a military takeover. Currently, the Communist troops have entered and occupied Dalian and established a government. It is estimated that two or three armies will be needed to take over, so the takeover period cannot be determined.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang 7th Dispatch] The first-line Sino-Soviet generals' meeting in Pulandian on the 6th was attended by Colonel Zhou Pu, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Commander-in-Chief Zhan Shizhi, and others from our side, and Major General Garisky and his entourage Yefidinov and others from the Soviet side.

<h3>Lushun and Dalian Under the Communist Iron Heel</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang 7th Dispatch] Lushun and Dalian, which are about to be taken over, have become ruins due to the Communist troops' thorough destruction and planned transportation by a certain party.</p>
<p>No Resources Left Lushun is the sea gateway to the mainland of the nine northeastern provinces and is also the lifeline of our country's future national defense. After Japan's surrender, the Communist troops first occupied Mutus in the north and then entrenched themselves here in the south, sparing no effort in their operations. Dalian is the only large import port in the Northeast, with convenient land and water transportation. Eighty-five years ago, the Japanese pirates regarded it as an important supply base. All military supplies, food, daily necessities, and various materials from North China and Korea were stored here. After the Communist troops invaded, they looted on a large scale and transported them to Lushun. After twenty months of ruthless exploitation, rice is as expensive as pearls. People cannot even get a full meal with ten pieces of clothing. Used clothes are piled up in the streets, but few people ask about them. Even the department stores newly operated by the Communist troops are deserted. Most of the adult men in Lushun and Dalian have fled, and in the past half month, even the old, weak, and women have gone out to find food.</p>
<p>Attempt to Obstruct Takeover The highest administrative organ of the Communist troops in Lushun and Dalian is the "Administrative Joint Office," which includes the administrative, industrial and commercial, financial, educational, civil affairs, judicial, maritime, and health eight-work research committees. There is also a joint office of the Lushun and Dalian Public Security Postal and Telecommunications General Bureau. The director of the Administrative Work Research Committee, Wei Chi Zixiang, serves as chairman and also as the mayor of Dalian. The Communist troops' political style in Lushun and Dalian is to flatter a certain country on the one hand and to win over treacherous merchants and gentry on the other. Their flattery of a certain country is an attempt to obstruct the takeover so that they can be entrenched for a long time. Their winning over of treacherous merchants and gentry is aimed at maintaining factory production and providing a source of troops. Therefore, the Communist troops' "liquidation policy" has not been used in Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<p>Military Deployment The Communist troops in Lushun and Dalian have a strength of about 50,000 people. Their military deployment is focused on the production of military supplies and the recruitment of soldiers. Since the National Army entered Pulandian and Piziwo, the Communist troops have been quite panicked, but relying on the complex international background, they still disregard everything and strengthen the production of military supplies. The military supply factory is located in the former Manchukuo Railway Factory, manufacturing hand grenades and rushing to make submachine guns. The Rongmachi Iron Factory in Dalian was also forcibly occupied by them to manufacture military supplies, which can produce 3,000 hand grenades and more than 100 shells per day. In addition, 300,000 sets of summer clothes were rushed to be made and transported to Jiaodong together. Recently, knowing that the National Army is about to go to receive them, they are actively expanding their army. All party members must introduce at least two young people to join the army. Every village head must introduce one person to join the army. Those who do not reach the quota will be charged with being reactionary. At the same time, they use the food shortage to lure young people to join the army and establish a police regiment. 2,000 people are concentrated for training to carry out assassination work.</p>
<p>Economic Chaos The Communist troops use various means to gather wealth, resulting in extremely chaotic economic conditions and making people unable to make a living. The original Manchukuo currency, Soviet Red Army notes, Korean bank notes, Japanese bank notes, and the Communist Northeast circulating currency and Central Reserve notes circulated in the market in Lushun and Dalian. Underground transactions arose in response to the times. One yuan of Manchukuo currency was exchanged for 1.3 yuan of Red Army notes, one yuan of Korean currency was exchanged for 2 yuan of Red Army notes, and one yuan of Japanese currency was exchanged for 1.5 yuan of Red Army notes. In the end, due to the chaos of the monetary system and the unlimited issuance of the Communist troops' Northeast Banknotes and Central Reserve Notes, prices soared. In addition to using their looted materials and paper money to completely squeeze the gold from the people of Lushun and Dalian, the Communist troops also imposed exorbitant taxes and levies, issuing so-called "urban construction bonds," "credit loans," and "military loans" to collect people's wealth and implement a tax liquidation policy, pursuing unpaid taxes from the Manchukuo regime. Those who have not paid the taxes in full are all heavily levied, issuing 3 billion yuan of commercial and civilian bonds, with denominations ranging from 5,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, and forcibly selling them to farmers. At the same time, they send people to check the accounts of shops, either fining huge amounts or levying heavy taxes. Most of the shops have thus closed down. Only 36 shops operated by the Communist troops monopolize the market. Large factories such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui have been forcibly taken over by a certain army. In addition, the Communist troops also took over the World, Xinhua, Zhongxi, Tianguang, Guohua, Mingshang, Youhao, and Zhongye eight cinemas, and the Dazhong, Guanghua, and Hongqi three major stages. The Dalian puppet municipal government once took over more than 30 factories for matches, rubber, iron, pottery, printing, chemicals, iron machinery, soy sauce, clothing, canning, pharmaceuticals, rice milling, and soda water.</p>
<p>Destroying Education Education in Lushun and Dalian has been almost completely destroyed, which is heartbreaking to say. All schools have either stationed Communist troops or been destroyed. Tables, chairs, doors, and windows have all been used as fuel. Equipment and instruments have all been destroyed. The Communist troops still advocate teaching methods, teaching anytime, anywhere, and casually, calling it "briefcase schools." As for secondary education, they try their best to promote "communism" and Mao Zedong's "New Democracy."</p>
<p>Dalian currently has the Dalian Daily, Xinsheng Times, Minzhong News, and Shihua News. The first three are all Communist Party organs, and the latter is run by the Soviet Red Army Command. The only publication is the Sino-Soviet Monthly, whose content is entirely propaganda for red revolution.</p>

<p>Ye Gongchao's Talk</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] This reporter visited Mr. Ye Gongchao, who attended the Pan-Asian Conference as an observer, and asked about his impressions of the conference. Ye replied that the holding of the Pan-Asian Conference was not a joint effort by Asian nations to deal with European or American nations, but rather a gathering of civil representatives from Asia to study their own problems and seek further cooperation with the world. The Chinese delegation in New Delhi deeply felt the greatness of India, the abundance of talent, and the　 ( ) sincerity of emotions. India also admitted that it had its difficulties and weaknesses. The Chinese delegation's visit to India was based on a set national policy, hoping that Asian nations would progress, gradually achieve economic and cultural liberation, and enable the existence of Asia to be integrated with the prosperity of the world. Ye said that he was unaware of the rumor that he would be appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Regarding the nature of the Pan-Asian Conference, Ye believed that it was entirely economic and cultural in nature rather than political. Ye boarded a train to Beijing at 11:00 pm last night.</p>

<h3>Allied Headquarters in Japan Continue Efforts to Resolve Reparations Issues, Soviet Union Obtained $20 Billion When the War Ended</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 7th United Press] A reporter has learned that the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers is now continuing to work hard to achieve a complete and early resolution of the Japanese reparations issue, and has sent figures to the Far East Commission in Washington, suggesting that Japan's vast overseas assets have been used as reparations materials. General MacArthur believes that the reparations issue needs to be resolved if Japan's industrial production is to be prevented from rapid decline. Senior officials here said that the US directive to General MacArthur to begin paying a temporary compensation of 百分之 ( )% is only a preliminary step in resolving this extremely important issue. It is said that the final solution to the Japanese reparations issue should be quite simple. If the vast overseas assets of Japan are taken into account, they have been used as reparations materials, and an agreement is quickly reached on which industrial facilities should be transported to the Allied countries requesting compensation, then this issue can be resolved. Allied officials told reporters that at the end of the war, the total number of corporate and private assets outside Japan was approximately US$40 billion, 99% of which was distributed in Northeast China, Korea, Taiwan, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, mainland China, and various islands in the South Pacific. Allied officials were unwilling to make it public, but in fact, most of these assets were in the areas controlled by the Soviet Union at the end of the war. Therefore, it is believed that the United States will announce that the total value of Japanese assets obtained by the Soviet Union is more than US$20 billion, and the Soviet Union should recognize this as reparations already obtained. The Soviet authorities have insisted that all Japanese assets that the Soviet Union has already acquired should be regarded as "booty" and have nothing to do with reparations, which the United States has refused. Japanese officials released the following estimates of their government assets abroad in 1939: Northeast China US$8 billion, Korea US$6 billion, Taiwan US$1 billion, Sakhalin Island US$1 billion, internal regions of China US$1.1 billion, in addition to other assets. These figures do not include Japanese private assets abroad, and private assets are even larger than government assets.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Water Conservancy Commission Refutes Xinhua News Agency's Rumors: No Flooding Occurred After the Yellow River Returned to Its Original Course</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] It is learned that Moscow newspapers recently carried a TASS dispatch from northern Shaanxi regarding the Yellow River flood, stating roughly: "According to Xinhua News Agency, although the Chinese government, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) had agreed that the breach of the Yellow River should be closed after the dikes were repaired and the residents of the riverbed were relocated, the Chinese authorities, disregarding the agreement, hastily closed the breach of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, causing the Yellow River to return to its original course and flood the area northeast of Kaifeng, resulting in the drowning of numerous people." A spokesperson for the Yongli [Yellow River Conservancy] Commission recently told reporters that this dispatch is completely contrary to the facts. It has been verified that since the commencement of the Yellow River breach closure and dike restoration project in March of the 35th year [1946], the CCP has repeatedly obstructed and sabotaged it. After an agreement was reached between the Water Conservancy Commission and CCP representatives on May 18th, efforts were intensified to expedite the work. The CCP then used the excuse that people were living in the riverbed of the old course and demanded that the central government provide relocation funds. The central government also followed the agreed-upon procedures and successively allocated 15 billion yuan, which was handed over to the CRRRA for distribution. When the project reached a considerable stage, preparing to close the gap before the Ling Fan [summer flood], the CCP suddenly requested a postponement of five months before the closure could take place, intending to delay the project until the period of the major floods, making it impossible to carry out the closure work. After several consultations, on February 7th of this year, Director Huo [Bao-shu] of the CRRRA, Chairman Xue [Tu-bi] of the Water Conservancy Commission, General Egerton, representative of UNRRA, and Dong Biwu, representative of the CCP, agreed in Shanghai that the dike restoration project in the CCP-controlled area downstream should begin immediately, and the breach closure project should proceed as usual, with the closure to take place in mid-March. Before the closure date, the Water Conservancy Commission would notify the CRRRA, which would in turn inform the CCP. Before the closure on March 15th this time, the Water Conservancy Commission notified the CRRRA and the CCP in accordance with the agreed-upon procedures. The Water Conservancy Commission rushed to close the breach during the dry season precisely to prevent flooding during the major floods, while the CCP's repeated obstruction of the closure was contrary to the purpose of preventing disasters and rescuing the people. Now the Yellow River has been guided back to its original course, the flow is smooth, and the water head passed through Lijin into the sea at 11:00 AM on March 21st, with no flooding occurring. The facts are all there, known to both China and foreign countries. The purpose of the Xinhua News Agency's fabricated rumors is to confuse international audiences.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Allocates 140 Billion Yuan to Restore the Yellow River Flood Area; Huo Baoshu Scheduled to Fly to Henan on the 10th for Inspection</h3>
<p>[This City News] CRRRA News: A collective construction project similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the United States is currently being planned. The CRRRA has received an order from the Executive Yuan to propose a restoration plan for the flood-affected areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, and is immediately preparing for its implementation. Since the closure of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, the threat of the Yellow River to the people of eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu has become a thing of the past. However, the 64 counties bordering the three provinces, which have suffered a major disaster for nine years, with 14 million mu [approximately 2.3 million acres] of farmland flooded, more than 500,000 deaths, and approximately 500,000 refugees, cannot be effectively restored through ordinary appeasement and resettlement. The restoration plan proposed by the CRRRA, with a scale comparable to the TVA, includes the construction of water conservancy and irrigation projects in the flood-affected area, the application of mechanized agriculture, the distribution of livestock, seeds, and agricultural implements, the construction of village houses, the restoration of highways and telephone networks, the construction of power plants, the installation of waterworks and public health projects, and the implementation of general social welfare programs, etc. The completion of the entire construction will take three years and require more than one trillion yuan of national currency. The authorities have prepared a special fund of 140 billion yuan for the first year's construction expenses, which will be implemented by the CRRRA in the 36 counties most severely affected by the floods. UNRRA has also agreed to provide agricultural, industrial, and transportation equipment worth the equivalent of 12 million US dollars. If the restoration work is completed, the Yellow River flood area will become the most prosperous agricultural area in China. The work of the CRRRA is nearing its end, and it is now preparing to use its final strength to work together with relevant ministries and commissions to implement the initial stages of the flood area restoration plan, which the government will continue to complete after the CRRRA and UNRRA are closed. Director Huo Baoshu of the CRRRA is scheduled to go to the Yellow River flood area for inspection on the 10th of this month, accompanied by representatives from the UNRRA Far East Regional Office and more than 40 senior technical personnel from UNRRA and the CRRRA, and plans to hold a technical conference in Kaifeng.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Mingbao Newspaper Smashed; Total Loss Exceeds 100 Million Yuan; Authorities Investigating Masterminds Behind the Incident</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 7th] Suzhou Mingbao, a long-established private newspaper in this city, was suddenly invaded by 40 to 50 people at 9:35 AM on the 7th at its editorial department in Jiusheng Lane. Two men, one in a Western suit and one in a yellow Zhongshan suit, were the leaders. They inquired about the person in charge, and after the servant replied that he had returned to his residence, one of them drew out scissors and cut the telephone line. A violent scene of beating began at this point. Some of the crowd also carried iron tools. In addition to smashing all the equipment and telegraph room machines, they also injured two staff members in the plate-making room. After ten minutes, the crowd rushed to the newspaper's business department and printing department in Mayike, overturned the No. 5 type case, and damaged all materials, molds, office furniture, account books, and documents. Fang Zhici, an advertising department employee, was beaten and seriously injured. After about ten minutes, the crowd completely dispersed, so when the military police and police bureau of the city defense department heard the alarm and dispatched patrol cars, there was no one left. Rumors after the incident suggested that some students from the National Social Education College participated in the violence. The trigger was that on the 6th, tourists Gu Nairen and others went to the "Chou Zheng Garden" in the school for sightseeing and started playing the piano in the music room. After the students tried to dissuade them without success, a conflict occurred, and they even resorted to violence in the Lion Grove Garden. After mediation by the city defense department, the matter was settled. On the 7th, Mingbao published the news, and the content was slightly different from the facts, which aroused the students' anger and resentment, and they retaliated by smashing the newspaper. The reporter visited both parties separately to inquire about the truth of this unfortunate incident. According to the person in charge of Mingbao, this unfortunate encounter was completely unexpected, and the total loss is estimated to be more than 100 million yuan. According to the authorities of the Social Education College, they knew nothing about the students' participation in the violence beforehand, and there were no obvious signs afterwards. After checking the number of students, there were no missing students. However, they acknowledged that it was possible that the news was inaccurate, which aroused the students' emotions and led to revenge. If there is solid evidence, they will certainly allow the students to be punished according to the law. The Suzhou military and political authorities held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the incident, gathering relevant agencies and the parties involved, to study the truth of the incident and the follow-up steps. They unanimously believed that other criminals were likely impersonating others to cause trouble and were the masterminds behind the incident. It was decided to first investigate the responsibility, then punish the perpetrators and provide compensation. The Mingbao authorities have expressed that they are waiting for a legal resolution and will temporarily publish a four-page newspaper starting from the 8th.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Small Loans</h3>
<p>Small loans have been announced and launched by the Winter Relief Committee of this city, with a total amount of 100 million yuan of national currency. The targets are (1) those who are from poor families and intend to engage in small businesses but cannot raise funds, and (2) those who already have legitimate small businesses but cannot turn around due to economic difficulties. The monthly interest rate is 2%, and the term is four months. According to this method, it can be seen that its nature is a low-interest loan, its purpose is to help general small businesses, and its function is active, not passive. It seems that it would not be impossible to call it a small low-interest industrial and commercial loan.</p>
<p>So-called small businesses originally do not have the qualifications to borrow from the financial industry. However, as prices continue to rise, the amount of working capital required has to increase accordingly. Their credit is not as good as that of companies. Under the pressure of these commercial loans, their difficulties can be imagined. Because in normal times, in addition to government agencies (before the war, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau had a Civilian Loan Office), there were also some charitable organizations that shared this responsibility. Now that both public and private economies are feeling difficult, the Social Bureau's Civilian Loan Office has not yet been restored, and there are very few private ones. These small businesses, in addition to piecing together and borrowing from pawnshops at high interest rates, have no way to obtain financing at any time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Winter Relief Committee's launch of this small loan is undoubtedly a very timely and reasonable relief undertaking. As everyone knows, the industrial and commercial economy is very depressed now, and the number of unemployed people is very large. Many small industrial and commercial businesses cannot afford to support themselves and have fallen to the status of vendors or switched to being single traders. Then, the urgent need for this type of low-interest loan is of course far greater than usual. According to news from relevant parties yesterday, as soon as this matter was announced, the number of applications received by each public pawnshop had already exceeded the quota, which can be seen: (1) the urgency of general needs, and (2) the severity of the current situation of high-interest loans.</p>
<p>Therefore, with regard to this issue, our first feeling is that the fixed amount of 100 million yuan is really not enough and should be expanded as soon as possible. There are three ways, as follows:</p>
<p>1. Mobilize the power of society and try to raise funds. Fortunately, the amount is not very large. As long as the leaders of various charity groups work together and make a high call, it seems that it is not difficult to do.</p>
<p>2. The municipal government should appropriately allocate and supplement funds from the relief expenses to enrich it, and should not completely delegate this responsibility to the private sector.</p>
<p>3. The above two items may not be able to solve the urgent need in time. It seems that the Winter Relief Committee or the five-person committee in charge of this matter can negotiate an overdraft with the Municipal Bank in order to be fast.</p>
<p>If we do the above three paths earnestly, we believe that it does not seem difficult to increase the funds several times. What needs to be studied and paid attention to is how to lend out in terms of technology and personnel.</p>
<p>According to the regulations, this loan is entrusted to public pawnshops. First, the application is made, then the investigation, then the summary is sent to the committee for review and the check is issued, and then the contract is signed. Moreover, the guarantor "is responsible for fully repaying the loan and interest, and is also responsible for ensuring that the loan is used for legitimate business." It also stipulates that "small loans are limited to one time, and no further applications can be made after the expiration of the term," which means that extensions are absolutely not allowed. In terms of the articles, it has been planned quite meticulously. However, according to past experience, there are also many malpractices. There are three main types: (1) overdue and unpaid, and no trace can be found; (2) applying under a false name, lending several times in one household; (3) embezzlement by those involved, borrowing under a false name. To sum up, it is that the applicant thinks that the matter belongs to relief and tries to take advantage of it. And those involved may also have people who do not know how to restrain themselves and intend to be opportunistic. Although the situation is different, the present is different from the past, and we cannot compare them to each other, and it is not appropriate to generalize. However, since there have been such malpractices in the past, we must learn from the past lessons and be careful at the beginning. This is what we should contribute first.</p>
<p>Secondly, the scope of small loans is ultimately limited, and limited to legitimate businesses, which is not enough to exhaust the functions of civilian finance. As the saying goes, "Emergencies are something that people have from time to time." When people from poor families unfortunately encounter other urgent situations, they cannot be helped by this small loan, and they still have to rely on general pawnshops. The monthly interest rate of pawnshops, although it has been reduced now, is still as high as three or six cents, which is eighteen times the interest rate of small loans. Compared with each other, this is such a serious matter! Therefore, in an article reviewing the pawnshop problem a few days ago, this newspaper pointed out the necessity of reducing pawn interest and its methods. It has been reported that the industry recently held a conference and resolved the request for low-interest loans. Our views can be said to be consistent. Unfortunately, although the principle has been approved, there is no news of the method, and the date of realization is still quite far away. Therefore, we feel all the more that the spirit of the small loans run by the Winter Relief Committee, which is to know and act immediately, is commendable.</p>

<h3>US and Soviet Union Reach a Stalemated Situation; Foreign Ministers' Conference Makes No Progress; The Crux of the Matter Still Lies in the German Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Moscow, 7th Broadcast: The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference must be completed after next week, and participants expect the deadlock to be broken, and all results will be similar to the first Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 7th Electric] The US delegation attending the Four Powers Conference today again expressed compromise, believing that the four foreign ministers will have at least two more weeks to stay here in order to make another effort to complete the agenda. Most representatives of the US delegation expect the Foreign Ministers' Conference to end in a stalemate, similar to the first Paris Conference last year. However, in any case, there may be a slight hope of completing the Austrian peace treaty here, which is what the US delegation hopes to achieve first. US Secretary of State Marshall's "main goal before was to discuss all items on the agenda (less than half of the main issues have been discussed so far), and then briefly discuss the German reparations issue, and then adjourn or postpone the meeting until the fall before it can be reopened. Today's power conference continued to discuss the form and scope of the German interim government, and may discuss the German border and Ruhr issues tomorrow on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Moscow, 7th Broadcast: The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed the issue of the German interim government again. The opinions of the British, French, and Soviet Union were quite consistent, but the US expressed disagreement, and it still did not get to the point.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 6th Electric] The fourth week of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, all parties expected that it would determine the success or failure of the conference, but the result was the opposite, which was very disappointing. The Four Foreign Ministers held a secret meeting on April 1, but still achieved nothing. The focus of this secret meeting was on the suggestion made by US Secretary of State Marshall that the Soviet Union reconsider its request to extract reparations from current production. British Foreign Secretary Bevin partly agreed with the Soviet request, but the various circumstances related to this request are very complex and numerous, which makes the Foreign Ministers' Conference indefinitely associative, and it is necessary for experts to study this issue at length. France paid particular attention to the Soviet Union's proposal, because this would affect the amount of coal that France requested to obtain from Germany. Molotov, based on the Yalta Agreement, demanded 10 billion in German reparations. It is also possible that Marshal only wanted to test the Soviet Union's opinion to determine whether Foreign Minister Molotov was prepared to set the price based on this battle as the standard. If so, then Marshal is now in a dilemma, because the Soviet Union is firmly unwilling to make concessions to Marshal's proposal. In short, other various issues (including the economic organization and interim political organization of Germany) are now determined by the issue of extracting reparations from current production. The US, Britain, and France yesterday reached an agreement on the various principles for managing the Central Economic Department of the future German interim government, but before the Four Foreign Ministers reach an agreement on German economic unification, industrial standards, and compensation issues, this kind of partial agreement has no value. And what is needed now seems to be a smart negotiator, who must be able to eliminate all obstacles that prevent the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference from making progress.</p>
<h3>Marshall Advocates that Poland's Eastern Border Should Return to Germany; This Will Inevitably Cause Fierce Disputes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 7th Electric] Authoritative sources stated today that US Secretary of State Marshall will strongly urge the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to restore the eastern agricultural region of Germany, which has now been transferred to Poland, to German jurisdiction. The four major powers had previously agreed on a temporary agreement stipulating that the Oder River and the Neisse River should be the boundary between Germany and Poland. Marshall's proposal today will cause this agreement to be amended. It is heard that the US delegation believes that Germany is densely populated and highly industrialized, but lacks food producing areas. Therefore, in order to balance the German economy, it is necessary to implement the above-mentioned amendment method. However, this suggestion will become one of the most fiercely debated political issues at this conference of the four foreign ministers, which is inevitable. Currently, the Polish people are unwilling to lose the territory they have already obtained, while the Germans are doing their best to support the recovery of lost land. According to observers, the Soviet Union is in the most difficult situation when this dispute occurs at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, because the Communist parties of Germany and Poland are each trying to gain strength, but the goals of the two countries are incompatible. It is not easy for the Soviet Union to handle this issue, and on the western border of Germany, the conflicting goals of the German Communist Party and the International Communist Party will also make the Soviet Union embarrassed. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is also encountering problems on the western border of Germany, such as France's request for special administration in the Saar region and the Ruhr-Rhineland region. Basic issues in the western border, such as the Polish border, have both economic and political natures.</p>
<h3>Slight Progress in the Austrian Peace Treaty; The Four Vice Foreign Ministers Have Reached an Agreement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Moscow, 7th Broadcast: The Four Vice Foreign Ministers have drafted a draft Austrian peace treaty and have reached an agreement that all property seized from Jews and other nationals during the German occupation period should be restored immediately. If it cannot be restored, appropriate compensation can be given.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 7th Electric] The representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers drafted the Austrian peace treaty and agreed today that Austria must return to the original owners the property of Jews and other people confiscated for racial or political reasons during the Nazi rule. If the original property cannot be returned, compensation should be given. It is rumored that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is prepared to re-criticize the US and British compensation policies toward Germany when the United Nations Compensation Committee submits a report to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Official sources expect the compensation report to be delivered to the Four Foreign Ministers today.</p>
<h3>Western Political Situation: Calls for Restoration Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The "Times" Madrid correspondent claims that Franco's regime has recently shown phenomena similar to those on the eve of the collapse of the former Republican dictator Rivera. However, due to the complexity of the situation, there is no hope for an early resolution. Franco, in a recent interview with reporters, mentioned the opposition of moderates, which is tantamount to admitting that his opponents are not limited to communists, exiles, and those hiding in the mountains. The fifth column in Madrid and Barcelona poses a greater danger to Franco than his enemies in Paris, Lisbon, and Toulon. The influence of the monarchists now occupies the top position among the various opposition factions. Every party, including the Communist Party, has people who support the restoration, the only difference being that they lack a detailed agreement with Don Juan on key matters. Attempts to weave a post-Franco united front based on restoration have achieved partial success, but constitutional guarantees of political freedom and the right to vote remain the main obstacles to a final agreement. The lack of agreement within the opposition prevents Franco's position from being shaken for the time being, especially since Franco still has the army loyal to him. Therefore, it is currently impossible to overthrow Franco.</p>
<h3>Observer of "Truman Doctrine" Comments on Truman's Recent Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Foreign policy observers unanimously believe today that President Truman's speech on Jefferson Memorial Day has resolutely revealed a global Monroe Doctrine. If the U.S. Congress supports Truman's position, this speech will leave a profound impact in the coming years. Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey has been criticized as the first step in a global policy to resist communism. Truman not only avoids suspicion this time, but also frankly admits that this is indeed the case, and cites history as a defense of his position. Although Truman repeatedly expressed his determination to support free governments against external threats in his speech, the last few words at the end of the speech provide a very simple and clear explanation of his foreign policy. He said: "The American people cannot ignore the people in other parts of the world fighting for human rights, thinking that it has nothing to do with them." Some observers believe that Truman's remarks can be called the "Truman Doctrine."</p>
<h3>Moscow Radio Broadcast: Soviet Union's War Expenses Against Germany and Japan</h3>

<h3>De Gaulle Delivers a Speech: Calls on France for National Unity and Cooperation with the United States to Maintain World Peace</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Strasbourg, France, 7th] General de Gaulle delivered his second speech today at the commemoration ceremony of the liberation of Strasbourg, stating that the United States and the Soviet Union are bound to create a confrontational situation. Therefore, in this situation, France needs to be unified and united to become the mainstay of Europe and contribute to world peace.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 7th Broadcast: De Gaulle delivered a speech today, the main points are as follows: (1) To cope with the current crisis, France must revise its constitution; (2) France should continue to maintain its Westernization. In the continuing confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, France must maintain a balancing factor; (3) Germany must be completely disarmed so that it cannot engage in aggression again.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Strasbourg, 6th] Today is the third anniversary of the liberation of Strasbourg. A commemorative ceremony was held here. General de Gaulle addressed tens of thousands of people, saying that if a new tyrannical politics threatens a part or all of the world, the United States and France will be able to join hands to resist it together. The General highly praised the United States' contribution to the war. He also pointed out that the similar concepts between the American and French peoples create an extraordinary moral connection between the two, and no change can destroy this connection. He also said that whenever the world's justice is wounded, the concerns of the United States and France will occur at the same time. The two major democratic countries, the United States and France, can issue the same powerful response when defending freedom in danger. The world today has an unclear horizon ahead and a difficult road ahead. To solve the problems facing mankind today, especially the problem of peace, all countries in the world, especially the four major powers, have a major task. De Gaulle also sent a telegram to General Eisenhower today, stating, "On the occasion of the unveiling of the American military monument in Alsace, I would like to pay tribute to the general. We will always remember the general, and we will always remember the brave American army of yesterday, today, and tomorrow." Communist members of the Strasbourg City Council refused to participate in today's ceremony.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, Strasbourg, 6th] General de Gaulle delivered a speech here, frankly abandoning the delicate balance that French politicians have tried to maintain in the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. He declared that the United States and France must agree to resist any new tyranny. Tens of thousands of French people listening in the audience unanimously recognized that what General Dai pointed to must be the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>United States Celebrates Army Day: Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Army Deliver Speeches: Strongly Argue the Necessity of the United States Having a Strong Army</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Today is the 13th anniversary of the United States' participation in World War I, which is also U.S. Army Day. Secretary of the Army Patterson delivered a radio speech, strongly arguing the necessity of the United States having a strong army. We must not forget that in this imperfect world, military power can still determine the fate of countries. The West Point Military Academy is well-managed and has achieved remarkable results, which is commendable. In addition, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower also delivered a radio speech, saying: The U.S. military's task of achieving security and peace can only be completed with the support of the American people. Unless we can restore the spirit of the past and believe that we can gain the support of the American people, the U.S. Army will not be able to complete its mission.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Situation Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 6th] April 6th to 12th is U.S. Army Week, which will be commemorated with the meaning of "A Strong America is a Peaceful America."

<h3>British Minister of Defense Speech: Insists on One-Year Conscription Law</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] British Minister of Defense Alexander delivered a speech in Llandudno, Wales, today, saying: The government will insist on the one-year conscription bill despite criticism from former Prime Minister Churchill. If Parliament passes the Conservative Party's amendment, the cabinet will resign. Former Prime Minister Churchill once issued a statement saying: The reason why the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party voted in favor of the government was that they heard the ministers issue public statements and firmly believed that the government's plan submitted to Parliament was the result of thorough research and was based on the advice of military experts. In fact, the government had obtained the consent of the Chief of Staff before deciding to reduce the military training period from 18 months to one year. I still intend to maintain this decision. If you impose the burden of national defense on us, and we take unnecessary risks and cause misfortune to the country in the future, there will be many people who want to criticize us completely. We offer a promise to continue working to the best of our ability so that international institutions can succeed in achieving their goals of true collective security on a solid foundation of peace. As for the Conservative Party's amendment, I would like to ask Labor Party members not to pass this amendment, because in fact it is a vote of censure against the Labor Party cabinet. If this bill is passed, the Labor Party cabinet will have to resign. By January 1949, 700,000 soldiers will be discharged from the army. Only by recruiting new recruits or volunteers can they be replenished. This means that unless we can take appropriate steps, the army's position will be threatened in terms of effectiveness and management.</p>

<h3>Japanese Local Governor Elections: Conservatives Win Big: Voters Abandon Voting by Half</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] Preliminary reports of the Japanese local governor elections prove that the Conservative Party has taken the upper hand. Of the 38 prefectural governors nationwide, 24 who have been elected are independents, most of whom are conservatives.

The mayors of Nagoya and Kyoto were both elected as independents.</p>

<h3>U.S. Trusteeship Agreement Draft: Security Council Revises Three Points</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 7th] The U.S. Trusteeship Agreement for the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific originally had 16 articles, three of which were revised by the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday when approving the agreement. The rest remained unchanged. The agreement must now be approved by the U.S. Congress before trusteeship can be implemented. The revised clauses are as follows: Article 3: "The Administering Authority shall have full powers of administration, legislation, and jurisdiction over the territory in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and may, under any modifications that the Administering Authority deems appropriate, apply American laws deemed suitable to local conditions and needs to the Trust Territory." Article 6: "In fulfilling its obligations under Article 76(b) of the Charter, the Administering Authority shall (1) foster the development of political institutions suitable to the Trust Territory and shall promote the development of the inhabitants of the Trust Territory in order to achieve self-government and independence in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the Trust Territory, its inhabitants, and its people; and to this end, shall provide the inhabitants of the Trust Territory with opportunities for administrative services on the territory and encourage their participation in the government, giving due recognition to the customs of the inhabitants when enacting laws, and taking other measures to achieve this purpose." (Sections (2), (3) and (4) of Article 6 remain unchanged from the original text). Article 7: "In fulfilling its obligations under Article 76(c) of the Charter, the Administering Authority shall guarantee to the inhabitants of the Trust Territory freedom of conscience, and, subject to the limitations of security and safety, guarantee freedom of speech, freedom of publication and assembly, freedom of worship and religious doctrine, and freedom of immigration and movement."</p>

<h3>Debates on the Mei Subo Case Conclude: Verdict Scheduled for the 14th of This Month: Prosecutor Expresses Doubt About Two Witnesses, Mrs. Bao and Others: Defendant's Lawyer Says Economic Program Not Yet Effective</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The "Foreign Tiger" case was heard for the third time in the District Court yesterday, the debates concluded, and the verdict is scheduled for April 14.</p>
<p>The defendant Mei Subo's testimony was not significantly different from the previous two hearings. Judge Meng Ting paid special attention to the gold and U.S. dollar part and questioned witness Mrs. Bao: You entrusted such a large amount of property, 21,201 U.S. dollars and 38 gold bars, to others with only a non-bearer code list and no other proof documents. Why do you trust them so much? Mrs. Bao replied: The gold and U.S. dollars were entrusted by Tianjin Linxing Company to Shanghai Xinfeng Company for purchase. Because Wang Dongchen, the manager of Linxing Company, was a known acquaintance, she entrusted him to transfer the goods without any suspicion. The court then asked why the code list held by Bao Tai Tai had the words "Lianfeng" instead of "Xinfeng"? Mrs. Bao could not answer. Judge Meng Ting then questioned witness Chen Xiexin, who replied: The gold and dollars were entrusted to him by Xinfeng after Tianjin's entrustment. He also had a registered name, "Lianfeng," so the code list given to Mrs. Bao was written on "Lianfeng" paper. He also said: Because he had no insurance equipment, he deposited it with Ebers Company. At this point,</p>
<p>the debate begins</p>
<p>Prosecutor Tao stood up and said: (1) Our country's foreign exchange is uniformly managed by the Central Bank. Without permission, no bank or money shop is allowed to operate, and Ebers Company, hosted by the defendant, arbitrarily buys and sells foreign exchange to supply illegal smuggling merchants. (2) Although Mrs. Bao came to claim the gold and U.S. dollars, she failed to provide strong evidence. How can such a large amount of property be deposited with others without a formal receipt or other deposit documents? The identity of broker Chen Xiexin is also</p>
<p>unclear</p>
<p>The letter that Mrs. Bao presented from Tianjin mentioned: "An unfortunate event in this bank". What does "this bank" exactly refer to? After this comes the defendant's lawyer Chen Tingrui to make a five-point defense: (1) There are many contradictions between the economic emergency measures program and the legal laws, and the judicial organs should not prosecute and judge based on this without legislative procedures. (2) Assuming that Article 7 of this method is indeed a law, but it was not implemented in Shanghai when this case occurred (March 3), because the Regulations on the Effective Date of Laws stipulate that Jiangsu Province (Shanghai is the same as Jiangsu Province) has a limit of 15 days after the government announces its effectiveness, the economic emergency measures program was announced on February 17 (Article 120 of the Civil Law stipulates that if the period is determined by the date, the starting day is not counted), so the plan in Shanghai could not</p>
<p>take effect</p>
<p>until 0:00 on March 5. (3) Ebers Company is a foreign exchange brokerage company. It is unfair to call the company in the indictment a "bank-natured organization." (4) Article 7 of the program is specifically to prohibit the circulation of foreign currency notes, and does not prohibit the circulation of foreign exchange. The telegraphic transfers and remittances that Ebers Company operates are not prohibited. (5) The currency notes confiscated in Article 7 of the program refer to specific currency notes that are currently in circulation. The foreign currency found in Ebers Company's raid was in a static state and cannot be confiscated. Therefore, please declare the defendant innocent, suspend detention, and return all confiscated property.</p>
<h3>Recovering British Tramway Requires US$4 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The exclusive contract signed by the British Tramway Company of this city with the former Municipal Council on October 10, 1905, stipulates that the valid period is 35 years (expiring on October 10, 1940). After the expiration, if the Municipal Council wants to evaluate and recover the property, it should notify the company of the intention to terminate the agreement six months before the expiration, otherwise it will be automatically extended for seven years. Later, because the former Municipal Council did not notify the termination before the expiration in 1940, the extension was for seven years until now. Now the expiration is approaching in an instant. According to regulations, the decision should be notified to the company on April 10 this year. The city government has previously submitted this issue to the city council for a public decision, but the result was only a decision to recover the property in principle, and there were no specific methods. Now that the declaration date is approaching, Mayor Wu held a tea party in the city government auditorium yesterday afternoon, inviting members of the city council's public utilities committee and relevant parties to listen to their opinions for a decision.</p>
<p>Yesterday's discussion still had no definite outcome, but the majority opinion was to continue the extension for seven years. According to Mayor Wu's explanation of the actual problems: According to the investigation, the value of the tramway company's assets is more than US$4 million. It is currently impossible to apply for such a large amount of foreign exchange. If the property is repurchased by converting it into national currency, it is still questionable whether the company will agree. Even if it is purchased with national currency, it will require 50 billion yuan, and it will not be easy to raise the funds. Therefore, he specifically sought the opinions of the city council. Many people expressed their opinions, and most believed that under the principle that the company's business operations do not harm our country's sovereignty, it may be possible to extend it for another seven years, and then find ways to recover it after the expiration. However, it is hoped that the city government should have a unified method for managing the city's tramways. Now that the concessions have been abolished, there is no need for separate methods in the British and French sectors. At the same time, close attention should be paid to the current management shortcomings and ways should be found to improve them. Mayor Wu expressed his high regard for the opinions of those present and will use them as a reference for making a final decision.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Concern: Police Officer Treatment</h3>
<p>Commander Xuan Announces Adjustments Will Be Made</p>
<p>Yesterday, Commander Xuan Tiewu told reporters: Since the establishment of the Garrison Headquarters' Inspection Team, the military, police, and constabulary have been unified under command, achieving remarkable results in maintaining public order. However, the responsibility of maintaining public order is significant, and the treatment of personnel in the Inspection Brigade has been considered for improvement. As for the treatment of police officers, he has repeatedly requested adjustments, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has also expressed great concern about this. When he came to Shanghai last year, and when Commander Xuan went to Nanjing to report on his duties, and recently when the Chairman returned to Fenghua to sweep his ancestors' graves and passed through Shanghai, he inquired about this matter with Commander Xuan. However, due to the city government's financial constraints, this has not yet materialized. Commander Xuan said: "However, this is only a matter of time."</p>
<h3>Workers at Ewo Cloth Mill Demand Reinstatement Without Result</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] During the war, the British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill in Yangshupu dismissed over a dozen workers from the burlap section.

The management claimed that they agreed in principle, but would reinstate workers gradually, and could not accommodate so many at once. The discussion yielded no results.</p>
<h3>Housing Dispute on Xuchang Road: Residents Petition the Mayor</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Seventy households residing at No. 623, Xuchang Road (formerly Huasheng Road), Yangshupu, are in a state of panic because the landlord, Nie Liukang, recently plans to reclaim the houses and convert them into workshops, notifying them to move out. Yesterday afternoon at around 4 p.m., the residents organized a petition group to the city government to petition, where they were received by Mayor Wu Guozhen. Mayor Wu first warned them that taking extreme actions by gathering a crowd to petition was a mistake, and that they could send a small number of representatives to come, and he would receive them without fail. Regarding the housing dispute, it is a legal issue of tenancy, which is not within the city government's authority. Representatives then presented the past leasing process and requested the Mayor to consider the serious housing shortage and write to the landlord for a meeting to find a reasonable solution. Mayor Wu agreed to consider it, and the representatives then took their leave.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis Bacteria Devastates Youth: 160,000 Patients in This City. Lack of Anti-Tuberculosis Equipment is Profoundly Felt. Anti-Tuberculosis Association Holds Fundraising Committee Meeting with a Goal of 1.5 Billion in Two Months</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The spread of tuberculosis in our country is severe. According to statistics, the mortality rate is 400 per 100,000 people. If the country is calculated with a population of 450 million, the number of deaths each year is 1.8 million, the number of deaths per day is 4,9300, and the number of deaths per minute is 34. There are currently 160,000 tuberculosis patients in Shanghai, with 16,000 deaths each year, which is even greater than the total number of deaths from all infectious diseases in the city, with an average of 43 deaths per day. Moreover, China lacks tuberculosis prevention equipment, and most patients belong to the poor class. After suffering from this "disease of the wealthy," they are mostly unable to afford treatment, spreading the infection to others, creating a terrible situation. According to statistics, most tuberculosis patients in our country are between the ages of 15 and 35, and most deaths occur at the age of 25, indicating that those killed by tuberculosis bacteria are young people who are the pillars of the country, showing the depth of the harm.</p>
<p>American Red Cross Donates Hospital</p>
<p>Recently, the American Red Cross donated all the equipment for an anti-tuberculosis hospital in this city with a capacity of 250 beds, worth 600,000 US dollars, or 67 billion yuan in national currency, which will be shipped to China soon and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in May. The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis United Committee has launched a fundraising campaign to receive and enable ongoing work, in order to expand the city's anti-tuberculosis work. Yesterday at 6 p.m., the fundraising committee was held in the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. More than 50 leaders from all walks of life, including Yen Hui-ching, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Wu Kuo-chen, Chien Yung-ming, Hsu Chi-ching, Chin Run-ching, Ting Kuei-tang, Chen Hsing, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Wei, Gu Chunfan, Wang Renlin, and the textile, flour, and banking industries, attended. Speaker Pan was unable to attend due to leaving Shanghai, and Yen Hui-ching served as chairman, stating that the fundraising target was 1.5 billion, and hoping that all industries would provide more help.</p>
<p>Hospital Site Determined: Ye Family Garden</p>
<p>Subsequently, Wu Kuo-chen, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Hsu Chi-ching, Chien Yung-ming, Zhang Wei, and American Red Cross representative Madi were invited to speak successively, all agreeing that during and after the war, China's economy was defeated, people's lives were difficult, and nutrition was too poor, leading to the terrible spread of lung disease. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it is necessary to build the country, and the people must first have a healthy body. Otherwise, not only will they not be able to keep pace with foreign countries, but they will fall behind even further. Therefore, in order to seek national health, career development, and increased work efficiency, it is necessary not only to treat tuberculosis, but also to prevent tuberculosis, and expand the promotion to all parts of the country, providing assistance to those who are unable to afford treatment. For themselves and for their compatriots, they should contribute more to raising funds, completing the plan, and hoping that the media will promote it more to awaken people's attention to tuberculosis prevention. The donation form was distributed to all industries, with the goal of completing 1.5 billion yuan within two months. The site of the anti-tuberculosis hospital has been determined to be located in Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan.</p>

<h3>Authorities to Crack Down on Illegal Broadcasting Stations Again</h3>

<h3>Overemphasizing Civil Affairs and Neglecting Military Affairs Led to the Fall of the Song and Ming Dynasties. The Ministry of National Defense Draws Lessons from History and Promotes the Significance of Conscription.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Garrison District Command recently telegraphed the Municipal Council, asking it to promote the significance of conscription, stating: "Approved by the Ministry of National Defense's Conscription Bureau: 'Chairman has forwarded a letter from Shanghai citizen Zhao Cheng, requesting that the conscription system be changed to a recruitment system, arguing that conscription has historically caused much harm in our country. Improvements only began after the Song dynasty changed to recruitment, and people resent the collusion of evil parties in military activities. An investigation reveals that the change to recruitment in the Song dynasty led to an overemphasis on civil affairs and a neglect of military affairs, resulting in weak military strength and the fall of the dynasty to the Yuan. Even after the Ming dynasty restored the country, it failed to address this weakness, and later fell to the Qing. After the Republic of China, repeated invasions by Japanese bandits due to weak military strength led to a situation where there was no way to pacify the local area internally and no way to prevent aggression externally. In view of this, the government promulgated the Conscription Law in the 22nd year and changed recruitment to conscription in the 25th year, so that the minimum number of standing armies can be trained in peacetime, and the maximum combat power can be exerted in wartime. Therefore, during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, the front-line combat power was infinitely replenished, and the Japanese bandits were finally made to kneel down. All this was due to conscription. Since the victory, military construction has been regarded as a century-long plan for nation-building, and military service is the foundation of military construction. Therefore, the Military Service Law has been drafted and promulgated with the intention of training all citizens in the country in order, retiring them on schedule, and giving them the knowledge of major events. Once the country is in trouble, they can rise up and fight, which is completely different from evil parties colluding to use citizens with no military knowledge as cannon fodder. We hope that you will conscientiously promote this.'</p>
<h3>Funding Issues Remain Unresolved: Conscription Survey Likely to Be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gao Baoshu, Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Garrison District Command, stated that the Ministry of National Defense has ordered all garrison districts nationwide to complete the first phase of the conscription household survey by the end of April, and to immediately handle applications for exemption. In Shanghai, although the Military Affairs Section of the Municipal Government has been established, the funding required has not yet been approved by the Municipal Council, and various preparations by the section have not been completed. The conscription household survey will likely be postponed. As for the number of people in the city who will be conscripted and undergo national soldier training, the Ministry of National Defense will determine this based on the report of the conscription household survey and needs. It is not possible to predict this at present.</p>
<h3>Commander Xuan Releases Statement on Incident of Conflict Between Wounded Soldiers and Police: Ordered Investigation into the Truth of the Incident</h3>
<p>Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with a reporter from the Central News Agency at 4 p.m. yesterday, stating that regarding the conflict between wounded soldiers and police on Chaoyang Road, Pingliang Road, and Meizhou Road the day before yesterday, he has ordered the Police Bureau, the Garrison Command, the Military Police Regiment, and the Wounded Soldiers Hospital to jointly investigate the truth of the incident and the causes of the escalation in order to determine right and wrong, and then decide on a handling plan. Wang Xianglin, director of the 20th Rear Hospital of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, visited Xuan yesterday afternoon to discuss the handling of the matter. Xuan hoped for two things: (1) The wounded soldiers established meritorious achievements during the Anti-Japanese War and should maintain this glory, leaving a good impression in the hearts of the people forever. (2) This matter should not be escalated further and can be handled leniently. Otherwise, in order to maintain public order, severe punishment will be imposed. Regarding the police firing their guns, the Police Bureau reported that it was because the gun was seized, while the wounded soldiers believed that it was intentional firing, each sticking to their own version of events. Xuan has also ordered a detailed investigation. According to regulations, the police may not fire their guns unless their lives are in extreme danger. Otherwise, it is excessive defense and will be subject to punishment.</p>
<h3>Shuttle Buses Between Shanghai and Minhang Establish a Joint Management Office</h3>
<p>The shuttle bus service between Shanghai and Minhang was founded in the 11th year of the Republic of China by gentry Li Yingshi, who raised funds to purchase and build the Shanghai-Minhang South Expansion Shuttle Bus Company. Before the war, it was leased to a transportation company for vehicle operation. After the victory, the vehicles operating on this line were extremely diverse.

<h3>Coal Supply Is Not Smooth: Far Below Expectations. The Case Against the Fuel Management Committee Is Still Under Investigation.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of coal merchants suing the Fuel Management Committee is still under investigation, and the outcome is yet to be revealed. It is understood that the supply of coal in this city is far from the numbers expected by the Committee. For example, Taiwan hopes to supply 50,000 tons per month, but to date, it has only been around 40,000 tons. Qinhuangdao is scheduled to supply 100,000 tons per month, but in reality, it is only over 40,000 tons. It is hoped that Jiaozuo coal will supply 20,000 tons per month, but due to transportation difficulties, only 3,000 tons were shipped last month. The supply of Annam coal will soon end, as the supply of Vietnamese coal was agreed upon when our army was stationed in northern Vietnam, with a total of only 100,000 tons. Only a few ships are currently waiting to be transported. According to government orders, Vietnamese coal is prohibited from being exported in the future, so the relevant authorities are eagerly hoping to replace Vietnamese coal with Jiaozuo coal. Also, during the recent disturbances in Taiwan, coal mining equipment suffered damage. However, it is heard that the transportation of coal on land in Taiwan is still not very safe.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Coal for Two Railway Bureaus: Train Frequency to Be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It has been rumored recently that the two railway bureaus will reduce the frequency of trains due to a lack of coal reserves. Yesterday, reporters visited the person in charge of the bureau, who said that the bureau currently uses 23,000 tons of coal per month. After repeated savings, at least 31,000 tons are needed. However, the Fuel Management Committee only allocates 18,000 tons per month. Therefore, the bureau has decided to suspend non-essential extra trains, while the general train frequency will remain the same.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Seeks Train Safety: Orders Custom-Made Turnouts for Replacement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In light of the frequent derailments on the two railway lines recently, it is understood that this is due to the long-term wear and tear of the tracks. General frog, turnout, switch point, sleepers, etc. should also be replaced to facilitate train safety. Personnel have been sent to the Shanhai Pass Machinery Factory to order 150 turnouts, which will be delivered in full in June of this year and can be replaced by the end of July. Other parts that need to be replaced will also be carried out in stages.</p>
<p>Also: In order to promote the early realization of the two railway bureaus' construction plan this year, Chen Bozhuang, director of the two railway bureaus, is currently having the secretary's office rush to produce various plan brochures. Chen is scheduled to go to Nanjing tomorrow, carrying the plan brochures, to report to the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Two Changes to the Method of Reporting Taxable Income for Businesses</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Emergency Economic Measures Plan included a provision to strengthen tax collection. According to the Direct Taxation Bureau, there are two differences in the way businesses report taxable income after the announcement of the plan: (1) Previously, after reporting, the bureau would review the accounts and then issue a notice to pay the tax. Now, after each business reports, the bureau will first notify the tax payment according to the reported amount, and then review the accounts to determine the taxable amount. (2) Previously, businesses had to report within one month after closing their accounts, but no later than March. Now, it is rigidly stipulated that all businesses must report before March 15, and recently it has been extended to April 15. To date, 40,000 units have reported.</p>
<h3>Captain of the Haitan Vessel Discusses His First Voyage to India</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The first vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sailing on the China-India line, the Haitan, set sail from Shanghai on February 12 for Calcutta. It arrived here the day before yesterday, carrying 10,000 tons of supplies from India, and is currently unloading at the Qiujiang Wharf. According to the captain of the ship, Teng Shiyang, the voyage to India was slightly delayed when passing through Hong Kong and Singapore. It arrived in Calcutta on February 28 and entered the port on the morning of March 1 after mooring in the port for a spine. However, the longshoremen were on strike when it arrived in India, which delayed the loading and unloading of supplies for a considerable time. It was only on March 22 that the goods were fully loaded and the return journey began. The impression of India was very good, and the local overseas Chinese warmly welcomed them. The ship hosted overseas Chinese visitors, and the overseas Chinese hosted a banquet for the crew. The two sides were very harmonious, and they hoped that national ships would sail regularly. He also said that there are still a large number of supplies waiting to be transported. The Haichen ship is scheduled to set sail for India tomorrow, stopping at Hong Kong and Singapore, and then stopping at Yangon before going to India. The ship is currently loading cargo at the Zhongzhan dock. Whether the Haitan ship will continue to sail to India has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>Central Asian Crew Requests Payment of Wages, Leading to a Quarrel: Patrolman Fires Gun to Disperse Crowd</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhongya ship managed by the Tongxing Shipping Company at No. 1 Zijin Street caught fire on its way from Shanghai to Jiujiang on the 7th of last month, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The families of the deceased crew members and the surviving crew members, totaling more than 40 people, went to the Tongxing Shipping Company at 4 p.m. yesterday to request the payment of one month's salary to maintain their livelihoods. After arriving there, many people argued loudly and suddenly had a dispute with the company's staff. The Huangpu Police Sub-bureau received the news and immediately ordered Patrolman Song to lead the police to suppress the situation, but to no avail. Some women lay on the streetcar tracks and refused to leave. Patrolman Song tried to persuade them, but was surrounded instead. He fired one shot to warn them, but fortunately no one was injured. At the same time, the police station sent more personnel to persuade them, and took 11 crew representatives, including Wu Dayun and Gao Changyuan, to the station for questioning. It is heard that the Seamen's Union is mediating between the two sides.</p>
<h3>The Four Defendants in the Fuxing Island Case: Insufficient Evidence, Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fuxing Island case, which caused a sensation with its hidden gold, has been thoroughly investigated by Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao of the District Prosecutor's Office for three months. It was discovered that there was intense friction among the personnel of the Executive Yuan Fisheries Management Office stationed on the island. The so-called gold hidden in the bathtub was purely fabricated and used as a tool for infighting by means of false accusations. However, it was found that there was a phenomenon of stolen and sold enemy-left materials on the island. Regarding the false accusation, the prosecution was dismissed due to the amnesty. Li Yunpeng, Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui were prosecuted because they were more strongly suspected of selling stolen materials. After repeated court hearings and witness testimony, no concrete evidence of the defendants' crimes was obtained. Therefore, Li Yunpeng and the other three were declared not guilty yesterday morning.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Zhengqi, a 37-year-old native of Hubei province who works as a plank box maker, residing at No. 52, East Qipan Street, has one wife and one concubine. However, Yang often sought pleasure outside the home. On January 25th, at around 2 p.m., he went to the home of his fellow townsman, Li Jinhai, at No. 245 Hong’an Lane, Haining Road. As Li was away on business, Yang seduced Li's wife, Wu Guiying (18 years old, native of Hubei province), and together they went to the Xinguang Theater to watch a movie. In the following days, they went to the Daxin Hotel on Ningbo Road and engaged in physical relations. Subsequently, they often went to the theater together and had clandestine meetings. On March 25th, they went again to the Changfa Hotel in Nanrenzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road, and opened room No. 12. To avoid suspicion, they later changed to room No. 10. When Li Jinhai discovered the affair, at 8 p.m. on the 5th of this month, he invited Yang's relative, Li Zhiyong, and Yang's concubine, Yang Lu-shi, to rush into the room.

<h3>Ninety Loads of Goose Feathers: Carrier Has Wicked Thoughts, Ship Owner's Private Sale is Exposed, Person and Stolen Goods Seized</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zu Zhuowu, a native of Wuhu, currently residing in room No. 28, No. 48 Jinlong Street, Shandong Road, entrusted ship owner Xiao Congqi (35 years old, native of Jiangxi) on February 16th of this year in his hometown to transport ninety loads of goose feathers to Shanghai. Because Zu did not send anyone to escort the ship, Xiao developed wicked intentions. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, he secretly sold the goose feathers to Sheng Hefang, the owner of Yuanfengsheng Fur Shop at No. 366 Zhengzheng Shandong Road, for a price of 200,000 yuan per load, totaling 16.6 million yuan. He received a partial payment of 2.4 million yuan. Xiao was originally a poor scholar. Once</p>
<p>He obtained this large sum of money,</p>
<p>after paying the crew's wages, he bought a watch for 180,000 yuan, a Parker fountain pen for 150,000 yuan, and a Zhongshan suit for 500,000 yuan. He lived extravagantly in hotels, seeking pleasure, and posing as a businessman. Since the goose feathers were shipped, Zu traveled via Nanjing to Shanghai, waiting for the goods to arrive, hoping to sell them at a good price. But after more than a month, there was no news.</p>
<p>Knowing something was amiss,</p>
<p>he inquired everywhere and asked about the ship at the docks along the river. Until the end of last month, he finally found Xiao's sailboat at the Yichang Road dock on the Suzhou Creek. He reported it to the Water Police Station, which dispatched officers to arrest Xiao and send him to the Criminal Investigation Section for interrogation. Xiao confessed everything. When the police went to the residence of the fence, Sheng Hefang, Sheng was not there. After further investigation, it was learned that Sheng had resold the goose feathers to Yang Fuquan, the owner of Yongsheng Wool Shop at No. 6 Songshou Lane, Beijing Road, on the 39th of the month for 310,000 yuan per load. Yang was arrested. After interrogation, he admitted the purchase, but claimed he did not know they were</p>
<p>Stolen goods.</p>
<p>The purchased goose feathers totaled 84 loads and 9 jin, valued at 25,938,300 yuan in legal tender. He had paid 8,938,300 yuan, with the remaining balance still outstanding. The goose feathers are currently stored in the Aisi warehouse of Longmao Stack in Pudong. Based on the confession, the police removed all the goose feathers and returned them to Zu Zhuowu. Xiao was transferred to the District Procuratorate yesterday on suspicion of embezzlement and selling stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Things About the Baojia System: Requiring Labor for River Dredging and Extorting Fees</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council recently received a complaint from Zhang Boliang and other residents of the eighth Jia of the second Bao in the thirty-second district of this city, stating that someone claiming to be a Bao officer came and assigned residents of this Jia to dredge the river. If no one went, they would extort 45,000 yuan in legal tender. Zhang and others felt that this conscription for river dredging was abrupt because the district office had not convened a meeting of the public to announce it or distribute notices in advance, and there was no official announcement afterward. Moreover, neighboring Bao and Jia had not heard of any conscription. At the same time, the location of the river dredging was not specified. The actual situation is puzzling, so they requested the Municipal Council to investigate.</p>

<p>Awaiting a Sound Solution from the Ministry of Education</p>

However, it has been more than a month since the original method was announced, and no printer has submitted sample books to the capital. The Ministry of Education has also ordered the directors of the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to invite local publishing industries to guide the printing, but the general reaction is that the timeliness of the national textbooks is uncertain, the business is not guaranteed, the books will not be able to be sold in the future, and the printing costs are too high, so the funds cannot be used, so most are waiting and seeing. It is now April, and the autumn textbooks are urgently needed to be printed and cannot be delayed any longer. He and Liu have recently re-compiled all relevant information for a thorough review in order to quickly seek a concrete solution to avoid causing a textbook shortage.</p>

<h3>Major Commodity Prices Suddenly Surge; Authorities Actively Seeking to Stabilize; Telegram Sent to Prohibit the Export of Edible Oil Raw Materials; Crackdown on Price Gouging and Smuggling in Rice-Producing Areas</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the economic emergency measures, commodity prices in this city have been relatively stable. However, due to the excessive amount of money in circulation and speculative capital seeking opportunities to move, commodity prices have recently begun to rise again, particularly for edible oil, rice, yarn, and cotton. Mayor Wu is paying close attention to this because of its significant impact on the lives of citizens. He stated while meeting with reporters yesterday afternoon that the main reason for the rise in edible oil prices is excessive exports. There is no oversupply of oil in this city, but the export of raw materials such as soybeans, sesame, and peanuts, as well as processed products, is continuous, resulting in supply falling short of demand and stimulating the rise in oil prices. To this end, the municipal government has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request a ban on the export of edible oil raw materials. It is believed that this ban will soon be conveyed by the Executive Yuan to the Customs Administration for implementation. The mayor stated that the amount of soybeans currently supplied to oil factories by the Food Administration is 8,000 tons per month.</p>
<p>The fluctuation in rice prices is mostly affected by miscellaneous grains. The mayor also pointed out another loophole: the government has long had explicit regulations prohibiting the transportation of rice to the north. Unexpectedly, recently, the Northern Gang has frequently been smuggling rice to the north, causing prices in producing areas such as Qingpu to gradually increase. Therefore, the municipal government has also requested the central government to strictly implement the economic emergency measures to investigate and crack down on smuggling. Rice prices should be able to gradually decline. The amount of rice currently under government control is substantial, so it will certainly not have an impact.</p>
<p>The price of yarn and cotton is expected to be suppressed in the short term. A large quantity of yarn and cotton from the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has already arrived. In addition, foreign exchange has been settled for 200,000 bales of cotton, which can be imported immediately. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently discussing the official price of this American cotton with the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which should be announced soon. The mayor concluded by saying that Shanghai is prone to fluctuations due to too many rumors.</p>
<p>[Additional News] It is reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently stated that the soaring oil prices in various regions are related to the large-scale export of edible oil. Therefore, it has specifically ordered the relevant authorities in various regions to temporarily prohibit the export of edible oil starting immediately. The possibility of opening up exports will be considered again after the oil supply is sufficient.</p>
<h3>National Bank Convenes Representatives from the Rice, Flour, and Oil Industries to Discuss How to Balance Market Prices; Regular Roundtable Meetings Scheduled Every Friday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Central Bank President Zhang and Deputy President Liu convened representatives from the rice, flour, and oil industries in this city at the Central Bank conference room yesterday afternoon at approximately 5:00 PM, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM. At the meeting yesterday, President Zhang stated that he had been away from Shanghai for more than ten years and was eager to understand the situation of various industries in this city upon his return. Recently, the central government has been determined to stabilize general commodity prices. However, because food prices often lead general commodity prices, he specifically convened representatives from the rice, flour, and oil industries to discuss (1) how to replenish Shanghai's grain reserves, (2) how to suppress grain prices, and (3) how to balance grain prices with general commodity prices. Representatives from various industries expressed their opinions. The rice merchants were the first to express their opinions, stating: (1) This city consumes 500,000 shi of rice per month, but recently the price of rice in Shanghai has been lower than in the producing areas, resulting in a reverse price phenomenon. Currently, Shanghai grain merchants have only 150,000 shi of grain in hand. In addition, recently, a large amount of rice has been privately exported from Zhenjiang and Wuhu. It is hoped that the government will pay attention to this. (Regarding this point, the National Bank stated that Minister Gu of the Food Administration has sent officials to the two regions to stop it.) (2) Transportation should be given priority to grain merchants. In addition, grain merchants cannot withstand the pressure of high-interest loans. It is hoped that the government will provide low-interest loans. At the same time, it is hoped that the government will regularly maintain 100,000 tons of rice in Shanghai for sale when rice prices fluctuate. (Regarding this point, the National Bank stated that the government does have 100,000 tons of grain in Shanghai, and 60,000 tons of rice can arrive in Shanghai from Saigon and Siam within the next month.) (3) It is hoped that the government will use all the daily necessities and cakes in its possession to exchange for grain from the countryside at fair prices, so as to avoid harming farmers due to low grain prices. Next, the flour merchants expressed their opinions, stating: Last year, the flour mills in this city obtained 3 million dan of wheat in the Ruju area of northern Jiangsu, which was sufficient to meet the needs of the flour industry in this city. This year, it is still hoped that the government will provide flour mills with the convenience of purchasing wheat in the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and northern Jiangsu areas. At the same time, it is hoped that the government will expedite the purchase of foreign wheat and provide manufacturers with low-interest loans. If the supply of flour in this city is surplus, then free export should be permitted. (The National Bank stated that the authorities have finalized 100,000 tons of foreign wheat, which can be transported to Shanghai in batches.) Finally, the oil merchants expressed their opinions, stating: It is hoped that the government will help solve the raw material problem. Private factories have already ordered more than 5,000 tons of soybeans from the Northeast. It is hoped that they will be allowed to be exported. (President Zhang of the National Bank stated that the private factories should first submit an application, which will be forwarded to the Northeast Economic Commission for handling. In addition, the China Trust Bureau will supply 8,000 tons of soybeans per month starting this month to resolve the issue of raw material supply.)</p>
<p>In addition, at the meeting yesterday, it was decided that Deputy President Liu of the National Bank will convene representatives from the rice, flour, and oil industries once every Friday in the future to discuss and resolve the difficulties of various industries at any time.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau to Convene Price Evaluation Committee</h3>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, has just returned from sweeping tombs in Qingpu. When reporters asked him about the various issues related to price management in this city, he replied that now that commodity prices have fluctuated and risen, from the perspective of the Social Affairs Bureau, it is intended to minimize various artificial actions.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market's upward trend intensified, and cotton prices jumped repeatedly. Because yarn factories could not replenish raw materials, they were generally unwilling to sell coarse and fine cotton yarn, causing the price of 10-count yarn in the market to rise by another 10,000 per count. 32-count fine yarn and 42-count double-strand yarn were particularly sought-after, jumping by 400,000. Public sentiment was unprecedentedly high. Because Textile Construction is still increasing prices periodically, out-of-town sales are not deserted, so the trend remains strong.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth showed a good trend on Saturday. Recently, due to an increase in purchases by out-of-town merchants, actual sales have flourished, and cotton stocks are depleted. The sharp rise in yarn prices has stimulated the cotton cloth market, causing the prices of various grades of fine cloth to rise. Subsequently, the director of the industry association notified a suspension of trading, which ultimately resulted in off-market transactions. It is said that 12-pound Longtou fine cloth recently sold for nearly 180,000, and buyers were very enthusiastic.</p>

If subscribers use them to purchase short-term treasury bills, they should be instructed to first convert them into national currency before proceeding with the purchase. (2) US dollar bonds should be purchased exclusively with US dollar deposits, US dollar cash, or other foreign currency deposits and cash, or gold. If the equivalent amount is insufficient to purchase the minimum face value but the subscriber is willing to make up the difference, it should also be made up with US dollars or other foreign currencies or gold, and not with national currency. (3) If the amount of foreign currency or gold used to purchase US dollar bonds is insufficient for the minimum face value and there is a remainder to be returned, it may be converted into national currency at the Central Bank's exchange rate. (4) Those who purchase US dollar bonds with foreign currencies other than US dollars will be issued bond certificates based on the exchange rate on the date of purchase. (5) According to Article 5 of the Regulations for Receipt and Issuance of Invoices for the Sale of Treasury Bills and Bonds, the interest to be paid by the subscriber should be converted into national currency at the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate. The income tax to be paid on the interest payment at maturity should be calculated and deducted in advance, and then the remaining amount should be paid. Regarding how to handle the fractional amounts when purchasing US dollar bonds with gold, the following has been determined: (1) The amount of gold used to purchase the minimum face value of US$50 of US dollar bonds is limited to one tael. If it is less than one tael, they should be instructed to make up the difference, otherwise it will not be accepted. (2) If there is still a remainder of less than one tael after purchasing with whole bars or blocks of gold, they should be instructed to make up another tael, or convert it into national currency at the Central Bank's gold purchase price of 480,000 yuan per tael and return it.</p>

<h3>Japan Under Control</h3>
<p>— Chen Xunyu (II)</p>
<p>The Practice of Allied Headquarters' Control Over Japan for a Year and a Half</p>
<p>The comprehensive control plan for Japan after the Allied occupation was approved and publicly released by US President Truman on September 22, 1945. This document, widely known as the "US Initial Post-Surrender Policy Toward Japan," served as the guiding principle for the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers and relevant US government departments in controlling Japan. To help readers easily understand the entire control policy and its implementation, the third and fourth parts (political and economic) of the document are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The third part (political) of the document first pointed out that the main task of the Allied occupation of Japan was to disarm the Japanese military and eliminate the source of Japanese militarism. The Japanese people should clearly recognize the shackles and suffering imposed upon them by the leaders of the Japanese army and navy and their collaborators. To eliminate this suffering, the Allies had to implement the following necessary measures:</p>
<p>(1) Japan must no longer have armies, navies, secret police organizations, or civil aviation enterprises; (2) Dissolve the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and disarm them; (3) Dissolve the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, the General Staff Office, and all secret police; (4) Immediately surrender all Japanese army and navy weapons, equipment, warships, and other military facilities, including military and civilian aircraft; (5) Senior military officers from the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, the General Staff Office, and government agencies, as well as the leaders who promoted Japanese extreme nationalism and militarism, and the main perpetrators of aggressive wars, should be immediately arrested and subjected to punishment; Well-known figures who had engaged in militaristic and extreme nationalistic activities in the past should also be immediately deprived of their public office; All extreme militaristic groups, whether social, political, or commercial, should be dissolved and prohibited from engaging in activities; (6) Military training doctrines and militaristic activities in the education system should be eliminated; (7) Former army and navy officers and non-commissioned officers, as well as those who had engaged in militaristic or extreme nationalistic activities, should not be allowed to participate in education.</p>
<p>Secondly, the document pointed out that the focus of the trial of Japanese war criminals should not only be on the passive punishment of war criminals but also on the active pursuit of lasting peace for the world and mankind. Therefore, those who had committed atrocities against prisoners of war and people of the United Nations, and those designated as war criminals by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers or the United Nations, should be tried and executed.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the document clearly instructed the necessary measures for developing human freedom and promoting democratic policies: (1) The Japanese people should fully recognize freedom of religion and should not use religion as a pretext for any activities of extreme nationalism or militarism; (2) Respect freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and protect all democratic political parties; (3) Repeal and amend all laws that create unequal treatment based on differences in race, nationality, belief, political opinion, etc.; (4) Release political prisoners.</p>
<p>Regarding the economy, the document (Part IV) emphasized that Japan should move towards non-military production. Therefore: (1) Any military forces remaining on the old economic foundation should be destroyed first; (2) The production of any military facilities and equipment is strictly prohibited; (3) The use of any equipment in the production or repair of naval vessels and aircraft is strictly prohibited; (4) All economic sectors must be strictly supervised and controlled to prevent hidden or disguised economic activities; (5) Abolish any production departments related to war preparations; (6) Strictly prohibit any specific research aimed at strengthening war; (7) Limit the character and scope of Japan's new heavy industry; (8) Restrict the production of merchant ships to prevent their conversion for military use.</p>
<p>The following key points are related to the reconstruction of a peaceful economy: (1) Industrial and agricultural groups organized on a democratic basis should be encouraged; (2) Destroy monopolistic economic forces and eliminate all obstacles to a peaceful and democratic economic system; (3) The Japanese people should be responsible for economic reconstruction, especially for the immediate and thorough reform of the old economic system and its activities, so that the domestic economy moves towards a peaceful path. To achieve this goal, the Japanese government should implement the following: (1) Prevent the occurrence of extreme economic hardship; (2) Fairly allocate all materials; (3) Surrender all materials designated by the United Nations for reparations; (4) Promote all reasonable and peaceful undertakings sufficient to satisfy the aspirations of the Japanese people. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, the document specifically pointed out: (1) Surrender all Japanese assets overseas, to be properly distributed by the United Nations; (2) Immediately surrender all existing materials that are harmful to peace and not necessary for peacetime; (3) Immediately surrender all assets plundered from the United Nations.</p>
<p>The Japanese government should assume full responsibility for managing its domestic finances, currency, and debt under the supervision of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. At the same time, the Japanese government should export some goods under the conditions permitted by the Allied Headquarters to exchange for necessary raw materials imported from overseas. In addition, Japan's overseas assets and assets lost due to surrender, whether owned by the imperial family or the government, should be listed and reported to the Allied Headquarters for verification and handling; Other measures for the imperial family should also be implemented in accordance with this policy to carry out the mission of the Allied occupation. The Japanese government shall not grant any country exclusive or preferential opportunities, nor shall it use industrial organizations to carry out the above activities.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the occupation, the Allied control policy towards Japan was largely listed in this document. Later, there were many supplements on individual economic and political issues in Japan, but in spirit and policy, it was consistent and there was no deviation. The implementation was also quite smooth. Whether it was the new political facilities or the disarmament of the Japanese military, they were largely completed within this year and a half. The Allied Headquarters also quickly dealt with Japanese war criminals. On January 30 last year, the Allied Headquarters promulgated the Far East International Tribunal Organization Regulations, which was composed of representatives from eleven Allied countries, including China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The issue of war crime trials will be discussed in detail in another article, and will not be repeated here. Before the promulgation of the Far East International Tribunal Organization Regulations, the Allied Headquarters had already issued arrest warrants on January 4 last year for all officials who had promoted militarism in Japanese government agencies. At the same time, it ordered the dissolution of all national entities that had promoted militarism, totaling 27 units. It also ordered the Japanese government to prohibit leaders of militarism from holding public office, from serving as members of the House of Peers or the House of Representatives, or as prefectural governors or mayors. The following officials who are currently in office should be dismissed immediately if they have any of the following:</p>
<p>(A) War criminals. (B) Professional army and navy officers. (C) Powerful figures of extreme nationalist groups, violent groups, and secret patriotic groups. (D) Figures related to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society, and the Greater Japan Political Association. (E) Important officials of financial institutions or development agencies related to the aggressive war. (F) Administrative heads of occupied areas. (G) Other militarists and extreme nationalists.</p>
<p>On October 25, it ordered the Japanese government to cease the activities of overseas envoys. On November 4, it ordered the cessation of diplomatic negotiations between the Japanese government in Tokyo and neutral countries.</p>
<p>On May 23 last year, it issued an order to abolish the special privileges of the imperial family, such as tax exemptions, and to tax the assets of 14 imperial families in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>On the positive side, on October 4 the previous year, the Allied Headquarters issued an order: abolishing all restrictions on political civil rights and freedom of religion, and abolishing all regulations established based on differences in race, nationality, belief, and political opinion.</p>
<p>In terms of finance and economy, the Allied Headquarters issued Directive No. 3 on September 22 of the previous year, giving instructions on the key points of the economic policies that the Japanese government should adopt in the future. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The fundamental principle of economic policy should focus on ensuring the minimum living standard of the general public. To ensure the minimum living standard, all domestic human and material resources should be concentrated on the production of essential materials for life.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the distribution of essential materials for life, the government should implement strong control and ensure fair distribution.</p>
<p>In terms of financial control, on September 22, the Allied Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to provide comprehensive financial information on each bank, insurance company, and other financial institutions and the imperial family financial regulations.</p>
<p>On January 24 last year, to prevent inflation, the Allied Headquarters instructed the Japanese government on three principles: (1) Government spending should be reduced to a minimum. (2) Financial deficits should be filled with national savings. (3) The Bank of Japan and general banks should not be used to fill budget deficits.</p>
<p>On October 20 of the previous year, it ordered the freezing of funds from colonial banks. On November 6, it ordered the freezing of the assets of the four major Zaibatsu (namely Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, and Sumitomo). Then on December 11, it also issued a freezing order on the funds of 336 companies affiliated with 18 enterprise companies controlled by the Japanese Zaibatsu. On November 25, it promulgated the War Profits Tax Law and suspended the military pension system. Starting on June 4 last year, it also ordered restrictions on the personal financial activities of the ten major Zaibatsu (namely Ayukawa, Asano, Kawasaki, Furukawa, Matsushita, Nakajima, Nomura, Okawauchi, Okura, and Osawa), and strictly regulated their family living expenses.</p>
<p>In terms of trade, on November 24 of the previous year, the import of items such as rice, salt, cotton, and oil was permitted. At the same time, items such as coal, silk, silkworm eggs, asphalt, and kiln wood were listed as export items. There have also been many improvements in labor laws. For example, the Directive for the Removal of Labor Suppression issued on November 10 last year and the Relief of Unemployment Act promulgated on December 3 are relatively significant and important measures.</p>
<p>Regarding the economic system, the December 9 order on the reform of the agricultural land system should be specifically noted, and the detailed methods will be described later.</p>
<p>In guiding free, democratic, and peaceful thought training and the education system, the Allied Headquarters' achievements in this year and a half cannot be ignored. Its most active expressions in terms of directives include: (1) Regulations prohibiting geographical, historical, moral, and other subjects with militaristic or extreme nationalistic qualities (January 3); Canceling regulations restricting book publications (February 28); Stipulating ten principles for newspaper publishing based on freedom of news reporting (September 21); Canceling regulations restricting news, telegraphs, and communications (September); Promulgating directives on democratic re-education policies (October 22); Canceling regulations on the public prostitution system (February 24); Abolishing the Japanese government's law establishing Shintoism as the state religion (December 15). In short, the issuance of all these laws has provided unlimited assistance in liberating the Japanese people, enabling them to obtain the freedom to develop their individuality and enjoy the basic human rights they have been craving in the past. The above only reveals a few key points, and the detailed and specific content cannot be fully listed within this limited space. I will describe them in detail separately later.</p>

<h3>Democracy Train is Departing! (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Guyuan</p>
<p>(1) "I Can Bestow It, I Can Take It Back"</p>
<p>The National Government, on March 31st, issued an order to promulgate ten laws regarding the preparation for constitutional rule. This was done according to Article 2 of the "Preparatory Procedures for Implementing the Constitution" resolved by the National Assembly and submitted to the National Government for promulgation, completing the process within the allotted time. Of the ten laws, four are election and recall laws, and six are organizational laws. In addition, there are implementing regulations for the election and recall of National Assembly representatives, legislative members, supervisory committee members, and various election and recall laws, as well as allocation tables for the number of National Assembly representatives and legislative members, which are still awaiting legislative procedures. The drafting of these laws was based on the spirit of a democratic constitution by the National Defense Supreme Council, which determined the principles of various laws and absorbed as much as possible the opinions of various parties and factions, social elites, and the technical contributions of scholars and experts. After the draft was submitted to the Legislative Yuan, in addition to the principles indicated by the legislative principles, the legislative workers spent three weeks, without weekends or holidays, working day and night to deliberate and study, seeking to make it more suitable for the expression of democracy. Not only did various parties and factions, social elites, and experts gather together to argue right and wrong, but also about two-thirds of the 150 legislative members were National Assembly representatives, and the opinions of the people were also revealed. In order to prepare for the departure of the democracy train, everyone embraced a spirit of great comfort, dispelling physical fatigue. Especially at the time when the democracy train was about to depart, the late committee member Zhang Fengjiu, at the age of 66, spoke with tense emotions and died in the parliamentary hall for the sake of democracy. This not only did not dishearten everyone but increasingly stimulated everyone's belief in democracy, striving to push this train forward, so that it could ignite and set off, and drive towards the avenue of democracy!</p>
<p>We are one of the selected representatives of the National Assembly for the formulation of the constitution, and also one of the initial reviewers in the Constitutional Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan. Since we have participated in these matters from beginning to end, we are more familiar with the mission represented by these ten laws and the meaning of their provisions. Now that these laws have been promulgated, we are specially responding to the invitation of our newspaper's reporter to give a brief introduction to this democracy train. However, due to time and space limitations, this article will only focus on the four election and recall laws. At the same time, I must first declare that I do not want to speak from the standpoint of parties or legislative workers; I would very much like to provide commentary based on objective views and the tenets of scholarship. What I want to say is:</p>
<p>The four election and recall laws are not only unprecedented in our country, but also not commonly seen in countries around the world. Although all countries in the world recognize the election system, the adoption of the recall system is not the case in every country. If a citizen cannot exercise the right to recall after electing their representatives, they cannot control the actions of the representatives. As a result, it creates the autocracy of a few elected people, and the people have no sovereignty to speak of except for a brief moment of freedom when voting. This is what scholars all over the world criticize. Our country has actually adopted the recall system, making it cooperate with the election system. People with suffrage will be happy to say, "I can bestow it, I can take it back." Under this circumstance, although every citizen is limited by reality and cannot personally participate in central government affairs, it has fully demonstrated the spirit of sovereignty residing in the people. This is truly worthy of being written in large letters and specially recorded first!</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the election system does not start today, striving to make it conform to the spirit of democracy and be a fully progressive measure is also a brand-new regulation. The election of representatives to the National Assembly and members of the Legislative Yuan specifically stipulates that "election procedures shall be conducted publicly" and that candidates shall "campaign publicly," and the principles of universal, equal, direct, etc., as well as the methods of secret ballot and single ballot, are specified at the forefront of each election and recall law. These were originally stipulated in the constitution, but because universal and direct elections are more difficult, more attention must be paid to the regulations. The adoption of the single transferable vote method is also to prevent the abuses that can easily occur with the cumulative voting method, and there is no other way. The President and Vice President are elected by the National Assembly, and supervisory committee members are elected by provincial and municipal councils and the Tibetan local council overseas Chinese groups. This is to take indirect elections according to the Constitution. Although the President and Vice President are elected by the people, they are servants of the people, unlike the National Assembly representatives who represent the entire people in exercising political power, nor are they like the legislative members who represent the people in exercising legislative power. Since the people are not electing their own representatives, it is not necessary to use direct elections for the convenience of conducting elections. Although supervisory committee members are still representatives of the people, their essence lies in representing the people of each local group, equivalent to the members of the upper house of various countries. Therefore, supervisory committee members, except for those from overseas Chinese groups, are all elected by the members of the local councils elected by the people, which is exactly in line with the so-called meaning of representing the local. Therefore, the nature of the two election and recall laws for the President and Vice President is very similar, and there is a natural division between them and the two election and recall laws for the National Assembly representatives and legislative members. The above is my general observation on the four election and recall laws.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing Electoral Units to Protect the Weak in the Election Campaign</p>
<p>Among the four election and recall laws, except for the fact that there is no dispute over the number of presidential and vice-presidential seats and the number of supervisory committee members has been determined in the constitution, the allocation of seats for National Assembly representatives and legislative members requires much research. The allocation of women's seats in the supervisory committee also needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>There are a total of eight types of elections for National Assembly representatives and six types of elections for legislative members. According to Article 135 of the Constitution, citizens with special inland customs only elect National Assembly representatives, and the number of women legislative members is allocated to various types of elections instead of being elected separately by women's groups, so there are two fewer units in the various types of elections for legislative members. Since supervisory committee members represent the local area, in addition to citizens residing abroad, who only elect eight supervisory committee members due to special reasons, there are also no two units for various ethnic groups in border areas and professional groups. Various ethnic groups in border areas refer to indigenous peoples, scattered in various southwestern provinces, that cannot have a province within a province to independently elect supervisory committee members.</p>
<p>The total number of National Assembly representatives still needs to be determined by calculating the population of each county and city, but it is at least 2,937, and at most it will not increase by more than a few in the calculation of numbers. The number of National Assembly representatives for constitutional rule exceeds one-third of the number of National Assembly representatives for constitution-making, and hundreds of party representatives from the constitution-making period have been reduced among them, which can be said to be closer to democracy. If it were not for space constraints, the more the better, which is a manifestation of national politics that no country has achieved. Legislative members are constantly involved in politics and law-making, and too many people will make it difficult to have high efficiency. Although a quota of 500 was not passed during the formulation of the constitution, it should not deviate too far from this number. The 728 seats in the draft election and recall law for legislative members still seem to be too many, while the number of seats allocated to Mongolian, Tibetan, overseas Chinese, and various ethnic groups in border areas seems to be too few. Therefore, reduce what should be reduced and increase what should be increased. The elections of various special units for National Assembly representatives may be limited by the precedent of the constitution-making National Assembly, and reluctantly maintain a ratio in the number of seats. The nature of legislative members is different, and since the constitution authorizes the law to formulate the allocation of seats for various special units, it is natural to make a reasonable decision on the numbers from the spirit of democracy. Fortunately, the constitution has provisions for the allocation of seats for supervisory committee members, which eliminates much dispute.</p>

<h3>The Woman Who Walks the Dog</h3>
<p>— Yin Xueman</p>
<p>My younger brother came to Shanghai from the countryside specifically to see the world and try to find some work. But in these times, what place isn't suffering from famine? Naturally, he couldn't find work, so he stayed temporarily at my place.</p>
<p>The lane where I live is very wide and quiet. Therefore, many people from the leisurely class spend their mornings and evenings chatting idly and pacing back and forth here. But what attracts my attention the most is a woman who leads a Pekingese dog around all day, doing nothing.</p>
<p>One morning, as usual, I was about to go out. Unexpectedly, my younger brother ran over excitedly. He seemed to have discovered something big, with a tense expression, and said, "Brother, how come there's a woman herding dogs here?"</p>
<p>When I heard this, I couldn't help but laugh. My younger brother is a very unsophisticated country person; in our hometown, we always use the word "fang" (放, to release) as "mu" (牧, to herd), so he thought the woman was herding the dog.</p>
<p>I said, "What do you want her to do? She has nothing to do after eating!"</p>
<p>My younger brother understood even less. After hearing my words, he was stunned for a long time before he stammered and asked embarrassedly, "Then, how does she live?"</p>
<p>My younger brother meant, what does she rely on to live? I couldn't explain it clearly for a moment, so I said, "You have nothing to do, you can study her and see how she lives."</p>
<p>He nodded in agreement. From then on, he seemed to pay special attention to the woman's daily life, actions, and the people coming and going from her house. Not long after, one night he ran to me and said:</p>
<p>"I found out! I found out! She's making money by taking a cut from gambling, right?"</p>
<p>I said, "Maybe, but maybe not necessarily; you can take another look."</p>
<p>After several days passed, he excitedly said to me again:</p>
<p>"Brother, this time I'm sure I can guess right, I've discovered her secret."</p>
<p>"You've discovered her secret?" I asked, feigning surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes, her secret. Do you believe it? I'll tell you."</p>
<p>I deliberately shook my head again, indicating that I couldn't quite believe it. And I said with a somewhat doubtful tone, "I'm afraid it's not accurate, right? You can discover her secret?"</p>
<p>"Really." My younger brother's face flushed with anxiety. "I followed her for several afternoons, and she always went to dance halls with one or two men. But those men are never the same one or two people, as if they change every two days. Because I wasn't paying much attention, I can't remember clearly. She's making money by 'selling dances,' right?"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh again. "'Selling dances' is a new term. Seeing me laugh, he immediately felt embarrassed, knowing that he was wrong again this time.</p>
<p>"How mysterious! What exactly does she do for a living?" My younger brother couldn't help but feel melancholy.</p>
<p>After I laughed, I said, "Yes, there are many such mysterious women in Shanghai. Who knows what they do for a living?"</p>
<p>My younger brother stared at the ceiling, stunned. Although this question was more difficult to answer than an arithmetic problem, it was more interesting than an arithmetic problem. Therefore, the woman who walks the dog had an even more mysterious allure for him.</p>
<p>"I will always discover her secret." Finally, he said to me with great confidence. "Anyway, I have nothing to do, I might as well learn from Sherlock Holmes."</p>
<p>"Good courage." I said with a smile; "Just don't become a Don Quixote-style Sherlock Holmes."</p>
<p>"No matter what, you will always admire me in the future."</p>
<p>I said that I naturally hope that Don Quixote. Holmes, can also have amazing success. But before he succeeds, I don't have much hope</p>
<p>Quickly passed? Because I was busy, I almost forgot about this matter. What about my younger brother? He seemed to just sit on the sofa and read books every day, and never mentioned it to me again. I was surprised that he didn't look like Sherlock Holmes or Don Quixote in the story, looking for clues everywhere, or making jokes. And I was also particularly surprised by his quietness and his sense of duty.</p>
<p>But, this night, he suddenly rushed in from outside the door. At that time, I had just returned from the newspaper office and was reading an article criticizing current affairs in the evening newspaper. But his expression told me that he had encountered something unexpected. Because after he came in, he was stunned when he saw me. His face was flushed red, and even his eyes were shining red. But his lips were pale, and his legs were a little shaky. He looked at me as if he had done something wrong, and his face revealed inner terror and panic.</p>
<p>I let him calm down, then said, "You, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>They still stared at me blankly, without saying a word.</p>
<p>"What did you encounter?" I said, looking at his face.</p>
<p>When he heard my words, his whole body seemed to tremble! His legs also seemed unable to continue to provide strong support, his lower body softened, and he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>I was shocked at this time, and quickly got up and helped him up. This child, who was only eighteen years old, began to cry in sobs.</p>
<p>After I made him calm, he said, "Brother, will the woman who walks the dog come to our place?"</p>
<p>"Why would she come to our place?" I tried my best to comfort him and said, "What did you encounter?"</p>
<p>"She, that woman who walks the dog." My younger brother glanced at me shamefully, and continued, "These past few days, I've been seeing her wandering on the street and in the hall every night. She, she brings a strange man back every night."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that so?" I said.</p>
<p>"Her dog is just a signboard." This poor Don Quixote. Holmes continued, "But that little dog is very fierce!"</p>
<p>"Did it bite you?" I asked with concern</p>
<p>"Yes". He said: "Tonight, this woman who walks the dog discovered that I was continuing to follow her, so she turned east and west, and I unknowingly followed her to her door. After arriving at the door, I couldn't help myself, and two tall men pushed and pulled me, and caught me in like a little chick."</p>
<p>"What happened then?"</p>
<p>"I was so scared that I shouted for help. But the woman who walks the dog hugged me in her arms, she smiled at me, she kissed my face, she hugged me tightly. She said: 'Little brat, would you like to sleep in this fur?' I struggled desperately, I said I wanted to leave, would you let me go? If you don't let me go, I'll keep shouting for help!"</p>
<p>"She let you go?"</p>
<p>"Later she teased me, but those two men didn't agree. They said: 'Little brat, leave the money behind! Do you think you can play with the girl for free'?"</p>
<p>"Then you……"?</p>
<p>They started to move while they were talking, and I couldn't resist even if I wanted to. They emptied my pockets, and threw me out with a pat."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh again. I said to him, "Didn't get hurt, right?"</p>
<p>"It's okay, no". He rubbed his hands at this time, brushed the dust off his clothes and pants, and looked at me embarrassedly.</p>
<p>"I told you that your Sherlock Holmes is not working, how is it? When the time comes, you are still a Don Quixote."</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly. After a long time, he said, "I should still go back to the countryside."</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Early Spring in England</h3>
<p>— An Zi</p>
<p>The bitter snowy winter is gone,</p>
<p>The coal shortage and power outages will become a topic in British history.</p>
<p>Today there is brilliant sunshine,</p>
<p>Patches of white clouds drift across the blue sky,</p>
<p>Every small branch stands tall and has vitality,</p>
<p>Some have already burst out with resolute green buds. The grass in the park is so loose, wet, and soft,</p>
<p>Melted snow water is still hidden in the decaying grass;</p>
<p>The ponds covered with snow and ice ripple again,</p>
<p>Gulls and swans all tell people that spring has arrived!</p>
<p>The female tourists in the park have also changed into spring clothes,</p>
<p>Colorful like butterflies dancing among the flowers;</p>
<p>Golden soft silk lifts in the wind,</p>
<p>Everywhere is a smile in response to this thriving business</p>
<p>Only my heart is like an ancient well</p>
<p>Perhaps because it has long been left behind in the motherland!</p>
<p>The motherland has such simple nature,</p>
<p>I have spent countless sweet spring days in its embrace.</p>
<p>Now it is past Grain Rain, and Qingming will be here in an instant,</p>
<p>On Ming Tomb Road, I imagine it is already covered with flowers?</p>
<p>The weeping willows by the Back Lake are brewing green clouds?</p>
<p>Who is treading the green grass by Yuhuatai?</p>
<p>Nanjing nurtured all my spring dreams,</p>
<p>Although I have also been intoxicated by the May of the old capital and the tenderness of the West Lake!</p>
<p>The spring of Guilin is stepping hurriedly,</p>
<p>But how much warmth is also left on those mountain peaks and watersides;</p>
<p>We dreamed in a boat in Yangshuo, listening to the gentle waves,</p>
<p>Found a home for our hearts and created our youth.</p>
<p>Panxi has red camellias breaking the loneliness of mountain living,</p>
<p>And the blooming peach blossoms by the water are always new!</p>
<p>I once took my daughter to climb a small hill for a nap,</p>
<p>The sunshine in March was covered by fragrant grass</p>
<p>I watched as the edges of the valley plains gradually unfolded,</p>
<p>After the spring rains, the Jialing River turned yellow and then green several times!</p>
<p>Indeed, everything in the motherland is somewhat chaotic and barren,</p>
<p>But there is unadorned beauty there;</p>
<p>Life in the motherland is so difficult and close to dangerous,</p>
<p>But there is a deeper love there.</p>
<p>My heart grew from the fields of the motherland,</p>
<p>I love it and understand it like my own life!</p>
<p>I know that spring in the motherland may arrive later,</p>
<p>But it must be more beautiful, more magnificent, brighter, and last longer,</p>
<p>How much I long to return to the embrace of the motherland,</p>
<p>Even if there is no spring there forever!</p>

<h3>Beggar</h3>
<p>— Lan Hui</p>
<p>Bring out hunger</p>
<p>Display illness</p>
<p>On the streets decorated beautifully</p>
<p>Auction off pain in public</p>
<p>Like a farmer in the long drought of June thirsting for the rain that the sky stingily sells</p>
<p>You are on the indifferent and heartless sidewalk</p>
<p>Begging for the rare compassion of the world</p>
<p>Hope supports you to walk towards others</p>
<p>But despair constantly pushes you away</p>
<p>You really should cry for this ungrateful world</p>
<p>In the harmony of decorating falsehood</p>
<p>You use a real, tearing voice</p>
<p>Angrily strike at those shameful smiles</p>
<p>(Old manuscript, September 9, 1946)</p>
<h3>Sowing</h3>
<p>— Guo He</p>
<p>Guo He Van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch painter who became famous in France and was a freak. He was compassionate from childhood, so he went to the mine and lived with the miners, he also served as a pastor and preached. Until the age of twenty-seven, he felt that his heart was full of passion and no one accepted it, and finally started painting, venting all his emotions on the surface. The subjects are mostly rural villages, especially the sun, resulting in poisoning, going crazy, cutting off his own ear and sending it to the person he was single-mindedly in love with. After recovering from the illness, he continued to create many masterpieces, but he died young at the age of forty-seven! Historians classify him as a post-impressionist. His style has had a great influence on modern times, and this work is representative of his sketches. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Record of the Gongchuo Hall</h3>
<p>— Wu Baofeng</p>
<p>In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ye Yuhu (Gongchuo) was the head of the Ministry of Transportation, and for the sake of widely cultivating specialized talents, he merged the four schools under the Ministry of Transportation: Shanghai and Tangshan Industrial Special Schools, Beijing Post and Telecommunications, and the Transportation Training Institute, into Jiaotong University. The board of directors nominated Mr. to serve as the president concurrently. Mr. used his unique powers, extraordinary knowledge, high vision, and long-term planning to lay the foundation. He also engaged in the reform and improvement of school affairs with meticulousness, candor, and openness. As a result, the four schools, which were independent and unconnected, were brought under the same supervision and management, increasing departments and equipment, expanding facilities, and actively developing into the highest institution of learning. Furthermore, believing that transportation talents cannot be closed off, he ordered graduates to be assigned to various transportation agencies for internships. Also, believing that transportation enterprises in various countries were changing rapidly and cannot be complacent, he stipulated that all graduates with excellent grades should be sent abroad for further study. As a result, the alumni of this school were all excellent in both learning and experience, and talents emerged in large numbers, serving as pillars of the country for a long time. During the Anti-Japanese War, transportation had to cooperate with military affairs, and the principals of railways, highways, aviation, and telecommunications construction were mostly from this school, and all the alumni were able to give full play to their strengths, endure hardships and be indomitable, and risk their lives to achieve the final victory. When drinking water, remember the source, all of which is due to the hard work of Mr. Hongmo and the pioneering power. April 8th of this year is the 51st anniversary of the school. Colleagues think of the infinite teaching and think of the great future. They are deeply respectful to Mr., and unanimously agreed to rename the Engineering Hall Gongchuo Hall, and build a statue in an area to be immortal. Baofeng has always been appreciated and rewarded, and has also been following the rules. I respectfully present a small article to mark the grand event. When I come to Ying, I can't help but admire and stop. This is the record.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 311</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain," Zheng Yan's spirit brightened, as if he had found something. "I don't dare to ask the captain, isn't this time coming south with a very important mission?"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"But to start work?" Zheng Yan was a little hesitant; because this was the superior's secret.</p>
<p>"Yes to starting the work of starting work... Miss Pingzi and I have other things to cooperate on."</p>
<p>"If the subordinate could know a little bit about the content... That is to say, perhaps I can think of a little bit about the content of the cooperation between the captain and Ping... Miss Nakamura; the meaning of 'observers are clear'..."</p>
<p>"That's right..." Just as Hejian was about to tell Zheng Yan about the secret mission, the maid appeared again.</p>
<p>"The car that the young lady was sitting in has now been found out; it is parked inside the garage. But that driver already went off duty and went home at half past ten; he will go on duty at four in the afternoon. Our manager here, because the master specified that he wanted this driver, asked the garage manager to find a way, and the manager promised to send someone to the driver's house to ask him to work overtime. At the latest, he can drive here by twelve o'clock. The manager said, please forgive the master, he didn't handle things well enough."</p>
<p>"Oh, very good, very good. Please thank the manager for me, I'm so sorry to trouble him. Anyway, it's already... Hejian looked at his watch, "It's already past eleven, we can wait until twelve o'clock... Please bring a few bottles of beer and some food..." Hejian spoke to the maid with a bit too much politeness.</p>
<p>In ten minutes, Zheng Yan was still holding that strange note and that letter, studying them carefully. Hejian had already taken off his kimono and put on casual clothes, still that summer suit. The beer and food he wanted were neatly placed on the table. The maid originally wanted to serve in the room, but Hejian said, "There's no need," and sent the maid out.</p>
<p>These two young people, because they work abroad, are already used to sitting habits and are not used to kneeling anymore. They sat around the small square table, eating and drinking, and talking closely.</p>
<p>First, Hejian told Zheng Yan very carefully about the secret of coming south this time; and explained the importance of the time factor! "Today is the 30th, and half a day has already passed, and things must be done effectively before sunset tomorrow!"! At the same time, he also explained that Pingzi did not announce any methods; "I am passive;" Judging from Pingzi's tone, even she herself still didn't know.</p>
<p>"I think the key to everything is probably in this letter." Hejian pointed to the official document sent by the embassy. "I plan to open this letter at the latest by four o'clock in the afternoon if Pingzi hasn't come back." Hejian carefully hid the letter in his luggage.</p>
<p>"Yes, for the sake of big things, of course, these small details can't be taken into account." Zheng Yan pointed to Hejian's view of personality that he was about to read other people's letters. "Does the captain need my friend to participate?" Zheng Yan proposed his friend for the second time.</p>
<p>"This is exactly what I'm eager to find out." Hejian expressed his opinion with extreme sincerity.</p>
<p>So Zheng Yan explained what he knew about this friend. …</p>
<h3>Tokyo Romance</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>Fat and twenty-nine-year-old Earnest Hoberecht, director of the Associated Press Tokyo branch, is now the most popular writer in Japan.</p>
<p>Hoberecht became famous for "one thing," and that "one thing" earned him $80,000!</p>
<p>Here's how it happened. One day, he went to the Shochiku film studio in Japan to cover a news story. When he arrived, the Japanese actress Hideko Mimura was pouting at the company executives, demanding a rewrite of the script—because the script required her to perform a kissing scene, and Miss Mimura, at the age of twenty-six, had never experienced kissing.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity, Hoberecht immediately told Miss Mimura and many company employees nearby: General MacArthur had stated that kissing scenes in movies could help promote the spirit of democracy. Then, he told the beautiful Mimura that he was willing to teach her how to perform a kiss.</p>
<p>As a result, he decisively carried out his mission to promote democracy—he kissed her.</p>
<p>Miss Mimura seemed a little dizzy. After a moment, she suddenly turned around and ran to the dressing room.</p>
<p>A tea server brought out a note written by Miss Mimura. The note was for Hoberecht, and she wrote: "Since today's event has occurred, I hope we never meet again."</p>
<p>The development of the matter did not seem to be what Hoberecht had anticipated. However, Hoberecht unexpectedly had good luck that he had never anticipated. It turned out that his "democratic education" had become a "legend" throughout Japan, and all Japanese newspapers reported on this major event!</p>
<p>Hoberecht became a well-known celebrity throughout Japan, and bookstores contacted him for manuscripts, and magazine editors asked him to write articles. As a result, two months later, Hoberecht's first novel, "Tokyo Romance," was published. The book was immediately translated into Japanese, with an initial printing of 100,000 copies, which sold out in less than two weeks, becoming the first best-selling book in Japan after the war. The main story of the novel is about how an American reporter pursues a Japanese actress and finally wins her over. Hoberecht himself admitted that the male protagonist in the book is actually himself.</p>
<p>"Tokyo Romance" earned him 1.2 million yen, which, according to the U.S. military exchange rate, is equivalent to about $80,000. Hoberecht's literary inspiration surged, and new books were published one after another: "Tokyo Diary," "Fifty Famous Americans," "Democratic Etiquette,"... each one selling well. Now, he is an Associated Press reporter from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., covering news and sending telegrams. After 5:30 p.m., he appears as a great writer: writing, writing, constantly writing.</p>
<h3>Filled with Primitive Spirit and Despising Chinese-Style Life – One Aspect of the Japanese National Character</h3>
<p>— Chuang</p>
<p>Some time ago, I accidentally found an English translation of a book titled "Chinese People," edited and printed by the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, on a street book stall. It seemed to be for propaganda abroad during the war. Unfortunately, there were too many missing pages, so I didn't buy it. However, there were many very interesting materials in it: for example, they often expressed surprise and incomprehension about our Chinese-style life, especially the two things of eating and bathing, which were so wasteful and unhygienic. In fact, this criticism precisely illustrates the stubbornness of the Japanese nation in terms of wisdom. We Chinese emphasize seasoning in our meals, considering healthy eating as happiness, but the Japanese have fixed dishes of only two slices of salted radish and a few small fish, and the amount of rice is restricted, saying that it is suitable for nutrition and beneficial to digestion. Bathing is also the same. A square wooden box filled with hot water allows a family to soak in it in order for half an hour, which seems very civilized, but the elderly and young can face each other naked at this time, which is full of a primitive barbaric atmosphere. This is not more elegant than our daily use of the bathroom, and able to rub a lot of dirt from our bodies (which the original book was amazed at). As for wearing "kimonos" and sleeping on "tatami mats," which others consider to have no aesthetic appeal or comfort, they insist on emphasizing self-affirmation and praise, and never even consider reforming and evolving these things. This is the Japanese national character.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Geishas in Decline</h3>
<p>— Mou Ning</p>
<p>The geisha system, which the Japanese consider the most interesting and famous, and the geishas with their faces covered in powder within that system, are likely to become historical terms in the near future.</p>
<p>Before this so-called interesting system enters the history museum, it is not without interest to talk about the current situation of geishas. Currently, the cost of living in Japan is quite high, and it is not easy to make a living through so-called charm and skill, and geishas are no exception. Their average income is only 5,000 yen per month. This small amount is already quite stretched to cover food and clothing expenses. The kimonos they usually wear are mostly bought from the black market, and each one costs at least 3,000 yen; in other words, it takes one-sixth of all their hard-earned money. Heavy makeup is simply a capital investment in their habits. Without this capital, they cannot do business, so they still have to find ways to buy cosmetics and wigs for makeup, even though they are out of stock in the black market, and prices are rising again and again, frighteningly expensive. It can be seen that the life of selling smiles is just a hard and difficult job in Japan.</p>
<p>The difficulty of selling smiles did not begin today. It may as well be traced back to after the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident. At that time, Japanese militarists had already restricted the life enjoyment of the military and civilians in order to "economize on manpower and material resources." Most geisha houses were sacrificed as a result and "closed down." Later, American B-29s launched large-scale air raids on Tokyo, and the prosperous areas where geishas gathered bore the brunt and were razed to the ground one after another. Seeing that the situation was not right, the geishas successively changed their careers, or even declared themselves unemployed and returned to their hometowns to eat old rice.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the U.S. military occupied Japan, and there was a period of abnormal prosperity after the war. Japanese businessmen and officials, tired of work, were rich and had no way to vent their frustrations, so they happily threw themselves into the arms of geishas, trying to eliminate their own worries, listening to songs and buying laughter, seeking pleasure and dispelling sorrows, spending thousands of dollars without any stinginess. The U.S. military was fascinated by the exotic atmosphere and, in order to satisfy the geishas' curiosity and win their favor, used a large amount of U.S. dollars as "donations."</p>
<p>Those who laugh laugh, and those who cry cry. The Geisha Association (a labor union organized by the geishas themselves) believed that the U.S. military and geishas were mixing too intimately, which seemed to be detrimental to public image, so they established a convention: they were only allowed to entertain the U.S. military in restaurants, and not in any rooms other than restaurants, and were not allowed to show flirtatious behavior. Since then, the U.S. military has no longer been "guests behind the screen," but only "visitors" in geisha houses. Note: The word "visitor" is borrowed from the Japanese geishas' other name for the U.S. military; it is not a name created by the author alone.</p>
<p>During the war, the area around Tokyo developed to about 10,000 geishas, but now only one-tenth remains, and it is still gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>Now, General MacArthur's order to liberate the geishas has been issued, which is tantamount to firing a cannon at the owners of brothels. Although geishas are still making money and living their lives today under the conditions of democratic prosperity, this kind of life is ultimately limited. If General MacArthur's directive can truly eliminate the geisha system, then the liberated housewives of Japan will follow in the footsteps of the geishas and take on their traditional hospitality work.</p>
<h3>Racing Against Japan</h3>
<p>— Ma Qi</p>
<p>While we are in the midst of a deep economic crisis, we see news reports that several countries have expressed their willingness to resume international trade with Japan. After thinking about it, I can't help but feel a lot of emotions.</p>
<p>Japan has recovered so quickly! It has only been a year and a half since the surrender, and it has already recovered its vitality. The embarrassing situation of defeat is no longer seen today; the country is peaceful and the people are happy, and foreign countries are naturally happy to rebuild economic relations. This is undoubtedly a sign of Japan's post-war rebirth.</p>
<p>Looking back to the eve of victory, all countries confirmed that China would become the most stable force in Asia after the war, and the prosperity and development of Asia's economic life would inevitably begin and be driven by China. Who knew that to this day, China is still plagued by wars, full of dangers, and unable to take care of itself, let alone lead Asian countries to prosperity together? Without a stable economic life in the country, normal international trade is naturally impossible to talk about. Therefore, we cannot even receive the "favor" that Japan, which we defeated, has received, which is truly not enough to grieve for ourselves.</p>
<p>There is no need to envy Japan, and there is no need to be afraid. We have already worked hard to defeat Japan's aggression in the past, so the future lives of the Japanese people need to be helped to improve. Based on the principle of establishing oneself and establishing others, we should play a role in transforming Japan. The problem is that we need to move forward vigorously, otherwise, if we fall behind the Japanese, we will have no face to show.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Still Resisting</h3>
<p>— Wei Rong</p>
<p>A United Press report from Pearl Harbor said that in the caves of Peleliu Island in the Pacific Ocean, there are still a small number of Japanese troops hiding inside, resisting the U.S. Marine Corps' mopping-up operations. These Japanese troops still believe that the U.S. military has only occupied "Palaus," and that Japan as a whole is still fighting. This news makes us feel the vastness of the Pacific theater of operations and the prevalence of barren mountains and fields. At the same time, it also makes us laugh; it is just as laughable as suddenly seeing someone still wearing a queue and calling the Qing Emperor after the Republic of China has been established for decades, waiting day and night for the restoration.</p>
<p>This matter is naturally not a laughing matter for the Japanese troops themselves. Not only do they not find it funny, but even the Japanese government and people, despite seemingly having come to a great realization under General MacArthur's supervision, would not find it funny. In their minds, they must still regard these resistant elements as heroes. Because this kind of resistance mentality does not only exist in the resistant elements in the caves, but is also latent in the blood of most Japanese people. When they see this news, they will feel resonance emotionally, not laughter.</p>
<p>And the U.S. Marine Corps engaged in the mopping-up operations probably also have no possibility of laughing. The Japanese troops are hiding in the caves, launching surprise attacks at any time, and can occasionally pose a threat to security and life. The Marine Corps has not seen the enemy surrender on this false island, and the state of war still exists. While they are engaged in mopping-up operations, they must also be quite vigilant. This mood is naturally not easy.</p>
<p>The only ones who probably find it funny are us who think the world is already peaceful and are "completely settled" and planning to enjoy peace, just as we are indifferent when the four major enemies of "poverty," "illness," "ignorance," and "selfishness" are still rampant. Just as we are reveling in the glory of being one of the four powers when feudal remnants and warlord remnants are still disrupting order and destroying security.</p>
<h3>Traditional Japanese Humanity</h3>
<p>— Fang Tian</p>
<p>The Japanese nation has diligently imitated the West in science, and the same is true for the arts, except for musicals, which are very strange. They have accepted any new type of design and expression in Western song and dance, but they have exclusively abandoned the sexually explicit "hip-swinging dance" (i.e., things like the ordinary so-called "hula dance"). Their reason is very simple: this dance is originally a very primitive expression of sexual behavior by indigenous peoples, which is obscene and cruel, and humans should not and cannot make it public; therefore, the Japanese can allow women's bodies to be exposed without concealment in public bathhouses, and can allow men to obtain sexual gratification under various conveniences, but they always deny the legitimate right of ordinary geisha dancers to take off their "kimonos" and change into bras and panties. Their obscenity is idealistic, and their cruelty is latent. From this, we can once again discover the stubbornness and incompetence of the Japanese nation's thinking.</p>
<p>Although the above facts are simple, they are indeed the eternity of the Japanese national character. In Japanese history, we can especially see constant records of those "heroic patriots" giving up their lives and even the fate of the country to maintain this eternity. Now the day of testing has arrived. Isn't Lire often publishing: Japanese men are secretly demanding democracy, and Japanese women are also proud to be close to American soldiers? But can the truth of their humanity, the goodness of their feelings, buried in the tradition, be liberated from now on? We look forward to the answer from the facts! (Japanese National Character II)</p>
<h3>"Eighty-Three Years Wrong"</h3>
<p>— Mustard Seed</p>
<p>Confession of an Old Japanese Writer</p>
<p>The arrest warrants for a large number of Japanese war criminals, like a thunderstorm, struck the heads of fifty-nine people who were like remnant leaves. Japanese militarists, politicians, financial tycoons, and literary magnates are all trembling for their own fate. At that time, the old writer Tokutomi Sohō (also known as Roka, eighty-three years old), who was once famous for his play "Hototogisu," was recuperating from his chronic illness in his cottage in Izusan, Atami. Hearing this thunderbolt, he suddenly picked up his pen and entrusted his feelings of remorse and repentance in a twenty-character five-character quatrain, which also overflowed between the lines. The poem is as follows:</p>
<p>"For whom do blood and tears flow? A loyal heart violates old age.</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of life change in an instant, eighty-three years wrong!"</p>
<h3>Cherry Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Luo Qi</p>
<p>The color and shape of cherry blossoms are very similar to peach blossoms, and you can't see the leaves when they first bloom, so they are also like plum blossoms. When cherry blossoms are in full bloom, it is also when people are intoxicated by the spring scenery. Japan often regards cherry blossoms as the national flower, comparing their sudden and dazzling bloom for a while and then their sudden withering to temporary success. However, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek also wrote this about samurai, whose lives are short: "The flowers are cherry blossoms, and the people are samurai. How beautiful, but also too tragic." Japan is indeed a nation that loves cherry blossoms, and there is an annual cherry blossom festival that is celebrated nationwide.</p>
<p>In the impression of foreigners, in addition to feeling some pessimistic sentiment, what is even more interesting is that many people say that cherry blossoms fully represent the character of the Japanese people and also represent the goods produced in Japan, which are beautiful to look at but not durable, like the women on the Japanese islands, who are beautiful and graceful when they are young, but become bloated and ugly after a few years. Cherry blossoms also symbolize the fate of Japan, which rises suddenly but is difficult to prosper for a long time.</p>
<p>Cherry blossoms have a special preference in the minds of the Japanese people, and now "the world has changed and time has passed." When the cherry blossoms are about to bloom again, I wonder what the people of the island nation of Fusang will think.</p>
<h3>Three "Magic Weapons" - Exposing the Tricks of the Eastern Mirror</h3>
<p>— Mo Lang</p>
<p>The "Eastern Mirror" was finally exposed in the epoch-making war. Japan, which calls itself the "Land of the Gods," can be said to be second to none in the world in its degree of superstition, but in reality, it is more accurate to say that it worships things rather than gods. Divine power, imperial power, and property rights are simply the same thing, with only three different names. When the Japanese emperor ascends the throne, it is said that he must rely on sacred objects in addition to relying on the divine body. The so-called sacred objects are the three magic weapons: the first is a mirror said to be able to illuminate and kill enemies, hidden in a white satin black box, which even the Japanese emperor himself is not allowed to open and look at; the second is a necklace made of gemstones similar to our country's rosary; and the third is a treasure sword that was lost in ancient Japanese wars.</p>
<p>These three magic weapons are buried in the shrine, and they are always kept intact. Each generation of Japanese emperors has to carry counterfeit mirrors, necklaces, and treasure swords to ascend the throne. The common people do not know the truth and actually respect them as emperors as if they were real, and at the same time believe that the counterfeit things are real. Do you think that the Eastern Mirror has been exposed, hasn't it become a fake magic weapon and a fake emperor?</p>
<h3>Happy Japanese Children</h3>
<p>— Li Shui</p>
<p>After reading the impressions of Japan published by the reporters who were invited by General MacArthur to visit Japan this time, I deeply rejoice that the Japanese children are happy. Compared with the children of China, which is called one of the five leading powers in the world, it is truly extremely embarrassing.</p>
<p>First, although the clothes of Japanese children are not luxurious, they are all clean.</p>
<p>Second, although Japan is facing a rice shortage, adults can save on food and are willing to go hungry themselves, but children must be fed as much as possible, so the elementary school students everywhere are all fat and cute.</p>
<p>Third, the Japanese Diet has passed a bill to extend compulsory education from six years to nine years, which means that from now on, Japanese children, regardless of gender, poverty, or wealth, can receive an education equivalent to our junior high school graduation.</p>
<p>Japanese children do not have to worry about clothing, food, or education. They have all the happiness that children should have. Looking back at our Chinese children, how can we not feel lost and sigh!</p>
<h3>Japan's New Rich</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>In Japan today, countless ordinary citizens are still struggling to make a living with limited rations, while the new rich spend money like water in Tokyo restaurants every night, leading a life of extravagance and debauchery.</p>
<p>These new rich mostly have large amounts of unfrozen cash. According to statistics from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, they frequent more than 24,280 restaurants and entertainment venues. These money pits are often located on the ruins of broken walls and adjacent to the slums of starving and freezing people, with a feeling of "the smell of wine and meat rots within the vermillion gates, and there are frozen corpses on the road."</p>
<p>From the conversations of the owners of these entertainment venues, one can imagine how generous these guests are. They often reward maids and dancers with huge sums of money without any stinginess.</p>
<p>An old owner said: "Our customers are not the middle-class people from the upper class as they used to be, but they have a lot of money, and we have to cater to their tastes in order to maintain our business."</p>
<p>According to the official price estimates of the police department, the total amount of goods spent in entertainment venues every night is 16,313,700 yen. However, since most of the alcoholic beverages and dishes are purchased from the black market, the actual amount is several times this number. As for the "tips" that these rich customers give to maids and dancers every night, they average more than 10,000 yen.</p>
<p>It is said that most of these upstarts are large hoarders of daily necessities who obtain huge profits by selling their hoarded goods.</p>
<h3>Starting from the Japanese Emperor's New Poem</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiahua</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Japanese Emperor Showa wrote a new poem, which is said to have been written in response to a poetry recital held in the Imperial Palace.</p>
<p>"People will love the pine trees that resemble people,</p>
<p>Whose green color does not change under the great snow-"</p>
<p>The above two lines are the words in his poem. This kind of beautiful and pure color has led many people to praise the artistic talent of the Japanese Emperor.</p>
<p>But this is a very superficial view.</p>
<p>Naturally, if we appreciate this short poem from an artistic point of view, the author's literary attainments, at least the success of this poem, are ultimately worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Literature is a symbol of depression, especially poetry, which is "the language of skill saturated with emotion" (Ai Qing). Therefore, if we study this new poem from this point of view, we will find that this is the Japanese Emperor's heartfelt voice, containing educational and warning implications, and should never be appreciated as a "poem."</p>
<p>The Japanese nation has a barbaric and cunning character. The strong Yamato nation is what they are proud of. Although they have now been defeated in the war, the simple-minded "subjects" have not yet given up their dream of a great empire.</p>
<p>Some people have long said that the way the Japanese are now so obedient to General MacArthur is just a way to adapt to the environment!</p>
<p>In this way, if we look at the new poem written by the Japanese Emperor from this perspective, there is no doubt that we will understand that this is a declaration of resistance by the Japanese Emperor. In this poem, the Japanese Emperor clearly compares himself to a pine tree. His meaning is: although Japan (the Emperor) is under oppression, it will not yield.</p>
<p>Japan has not been tamed. The so-called "democracy" is just a kind of decoration in their politics, a deception and response to the Allied countries. The brutal Japanese warlords have not reduced their strength, are lurking, and are eager to try! And they are already preparing to restore the "Great Japanese Empire."</p>
<p>Do you believe that the Shibuya Incident and the flags on the Huangpu River have no political conspiracy?</p>
