<h3>外部採納各方意見準備對日和約草案　王世杰今離紐約飛東京</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京十九日電﹞外部對日和約審議委員會政治•經濟經外交各小組，週來分別集會，幾無虛日，各有關機關及專家輿論之意見，深為外部重視，多所採納，如張羣院長十八日向參政會駐委員報告之收回琉球之主張，即係徵詢各方竟後，鄭重決定者，審議會之討論遍及各可能問題，預期我國所準備之對日和約草案，必可臻於完美之增，為國人擁護，而獲得盟國之重視。</p>
<p>﹝中央社成功湖十八日合衆電﹞中國外長主世杰，定廿日下午四時自紐約取道東京飛返南京。中國人士僅謂：南京方面公務繁忙，亟待王氏辦理，而拒絕加以詳述。</p>
<p>﹝合衆社紐約十九日電﹞此間消息最靈通方面相信，在一九四入年初以前，召開對日和約初步會議之希望已告斷絕。由於中國外長王世杰二週來與美方官員屢次談話之結果，中國反對美國對投票程序之主張之態度，在今後數週內可告克服。據悉：中國己自美國取得保證，美國建議於和約簽訂後，管制將無損於中國，然中國不能改變美國所主張應准許日本具有相當於一九三○至一九三四年間之永久經濟永準。中美兩方對日木應具有商輪噸位之總數一點，意見相距甚遠，此事在和會正式舉行前，尚無取得妥協之希望。同時，此間有人相信，十一月廿五日四强在倫敦會議時，美國將利用此機會，再度勸令蘇聯參預和會，然如蘇聯繼續拒絕，美國在中國表示願意參加時，即將逕自進行召集手續。</p>
<h3>我商務代表談話　日應重訂對華貿易政策</h3>
<p>﹝中央社東京十入日電﹞我國政府商務代表唐菊生稱：除非日木重新厘訂其對華貿易政策，不然我國與日本問之實物貿易將爲不可能。日本重採戰前以廉價貨物及不必要之商品傾銷我國市塲之政第，將毀滅建立兩國間友好商務關係之任何可能性。唐氏係於上週前抵達此間，渠强調稱：未來自日運往我國之輪出品，應限於機器與工具等物品，蓄此等輸出品，將有助我國建立生產之能力，並將對我國國民經濟之復原能有貢獻。唐氏建議我國工業家及貿易商，應對中日兩國問以原料與成品互相交洗之情形擬訂對策，以領導重新建立兩國間之商務關係，現下兩國間之貿易，由於兩國均缺乏美元，而受阻碍，我國現下作輸入品用之外匯數額，業已用罄。唐氏透　稱：我國於下一季節輸入品所用之外匯數額宜布之前，已無美元存款可炎購買日本商品。唐氏並指出技術上之困難，諸如貿易’貨幣兌換之格式，付款之方法，以及另外之兩國間貿易之交通阻碍，除非此種交通阻碍得告消除，否則我國私人留易商，將不克前來日本，作出售或購買之交易。</p>
<h3>收回香港問題可獲合高精尖解决　外部答覆參政員詢問</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京十九日電﹞關於收回香港問題，參政員前曾提詢外交部，頃經外部答覆，表示在中。英關係更形友善之後，香港問題當可獲得合理之解決。外部認爲：在此年餘以來，中•英邦交已日漸友善，英政府對英控制區域內人民之民族思想，亦極注意，將用以根據而變更其過去政策。</p>
<h3>澳門問題　待將來提出</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京十九日電﹞收回澳門問題，我外交部曾於中葡商訂取消不平等新約時，與葡方數度商談，惟葡方始終學持不議，及依照一八八七年中葡條約，澳門係由我准葡「永駐管理」，其性質與租借地不同，幾與割讓地相等，外部有鑒於此，認爲此事不宜久懸，否則將拖延取消葡在華領事裁判權問題，故巳先以換文方式與葡方簽定取消上項特權，以期於將來議約時，我仍可提出澳門問題，而求一般關係之調鑒。我向加購機談判已完成交貨辦法亦決定</p>
<p>﹝聯合社渥太華十八日電」加拿大報紙今日載稱，中國政府商購加拿大　餘蚊式戰門轟炸機約一百五十架，談判業已究成，大約共須付欵一千萬至一千二百萬獎元，其辦法如下：　中國向戰爭賢產公司購買飛儀，代價五百萬美元。　此項飛機由中國移交托倫多哈佛利飛機公司，依照所訂契約，加以調整，另需五百萬至七百萬美元。　由哈佛利飛機公司向中國交貨。</p>
<h3>波前駐美大使主張即時援華</h3>
<p>﹝中央社就金山十入日電﹞波關前駐美大使塞查諾斯基，頃向此間共和俱樂部演說稱：美應立即盡全力以「軍事，政治，經濟」之援助界予中國。渠云：「吾人決不能令波蘭之不幸重演于中國，援華此其時矣」。按塞氏刻正申請入為美國。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社馬尼剌十九日電﹞馬尼刺紀事報今日詳稱：美國如果認爲巾國目前應能自力整頓，因而放棄援助中國之決心，將來必致　成大錯，後悔莫及。蘇聯或將取而代之，獲得成功。</p>

<h3>改革幣制之時間問題</h3>
<p>近幾個月來，特價飛漲，漫無止境，法幣購買力，愈形低落，通貨膨脹似已近惡性階段。於是改革幣制問題，復成為討論中心問題；無論何人，都認為改革幣制，已屬絕對必要，但是什么時候改革幣制，則各方意見仍未能一致。本文主題，意在說明目前改革幣制已成為刻不容緩之事，改革愈早，幣制尚可設法挽救，改革愈遲，經濟恐更不堪設想。請說明其理由於下：</p>
<p>目前我國特價指數，據中央銀行金融週報，九月二十九日至十四日一週間，上海躉售特價指數已至四·九〇三·一二一；換言之，即為戰前（二十六年）之四萬千餘倍，籠統言之，可謂物價已漲至五萬倍（實際上恐還不祇此數）。要知道我國目前的物價及通貨惡性膨脹已至何種程度，最好與一九二三年德國馬克情形相比較一下。德國紙馬克，自一九一四年大戰爆發以後，年年跌價，其情形與我國目前法幣情形相倣。若以每年平均數計算，則一金馬克（即平時馬克價值）合紙馬克數目如下：可見馬克的紙價，愈來愈快。試以一九二三年每月底為例，每一金馬克紙馬克如下：</p>
<p>所以實際上到一九二三年十月，紙馬克已經完全崩潰。我國目前物價如以五萬倍計算，則戰前法幣一元，約合現在法幣五萬元，已相當於一九二三年六·七月間德國紙馬克情形。如再不及早設法改革幣制，則法幣的崩潰，恐將變成無法避免的事。</p>
<p>或以為德國當年對於紙馬克，政府聽其跌落，有意使之消滅，藉以消滅其債務，而我國對於法幣，則政府尚在設法維持，似不相提並論。實則一種貨幣之跌落，有其自然之趨勢，到了某一階段，其下跌的力量非常之大，幾將無法遏止。故無論有意使之消滅也罷，有意加以維持之罷，在一種幣制跌落已到了五萬倍地步，除非及早改革幣制，方可制止惡性通貨膨脹的更趨嚴重，而避免經濟崩潰。</p>
<p>或以為目前改革幣制條件，尚未具備，故改革幣制時機，尚未成熟。但假若法幣眞到一旦崩潰，試問改革幣制條件已否具備；若到那時尚未具備，試問政府何以善其後？或又以為目前有三種不平等狀態；第一財政收支不平衡，第二是國際收支不平衡，第三是生產與消費不平衡，這三種不平衡狀態一日存在，即幣制一日無法改革。實則這種看法，未免錯誤，而不幸這種錯誤的看法，又大抵出之於現在的金融當局。因為在目前法幣繼續跌落，通貨不斷膨脹之下，這三種不平衡狀態，勢必只有愈趨嚴重：第一，財政收支不平衡，目前已甚嚴重，但若物價愈趨飛漲，支出愈趨增加，通貨更加膨脹之下，惡性循環愈演愈烈，財政收支只有愈趨不平衡！因為稅收永遠追不上物價（原因是稅收旣不應該與物價賽跑，而時間上技術上又無法追上物價），公債又無法發行，結果只有依賴通貨膨脹，而惡性循環乃有增無已。第二，國際收支不平衡，也是通貨膨脹的結果，而不是通貨膨脹無法遏止的原因。在目前外匯管理制度之下，希望多收僑匯，希望多增加輸出，恐已全成畫餅，因為所謂掛牌市價與黑市自必仍有相當距離，所謂「吸收僑匯」，實已證明完全失敗，至於增加輸出，在國內物價水凖早已高過世界商塲水凖情形之下，又何嘗眞能設法增加出口？所謂外匯平衡基金委員會，更只有追隨黑市上漲，毫無「平衡」匯價的能力！倘法幣價值乃一再不斷下跌恐政府雖用盡當霆萬鈞之力，我們將只見金鈔黑市的依然飛漲，未必即能希望國際收支可以趨於平衡。第三，生產與消費的不平衡，「再生產」早已無法進行，加以工礦事業橫遭摧毀，交通破壞，運輸停頓，生產又如何可以增加？公私交困，民窮財盡，大多數民眾已掙扎在饑飾綫上，「節約」用不着向他們去談！法幣暴跌，朝不保夕，人民心理在搶購物資，用錢惟恐不早，還談什麼儲蓄？要等生產與消費可以平衡，國際收支可以平衡，財政收支可以平衡，然後再來改革幣制，眞是所謂「俟河之清，人壽幾何？」另一方面來說，若果眞財政收支可以平衡了，國際收支可以平衡了，生產與消費可以平衡了，則是「天下太平」，法幣萬靈，一切都已上了軌道，又何必金融當局多此一舉，再來改革幣制？</p>
<p>目前此種流行觀念的大錯誤，乃是誤認這三種不平衡是阻礙通貨改革的因素，而不知道通貨膨脹却正是這三種不平衡的主因。要使財政收支平衡，國際收支平衡，生產與消費平衡，必須先停止通貨膨脹；而要停止通貨膨脹，必須先改革幣制。此種流行觀念的錯誤，正犯了倒因為果的毛病。可惜的是：這種錯誤觀念正出之於金融當局，於是一誤再誤，而經濟問題遂愈趨嚴重！</p>
<p>改革幣制旣已刻不容緩，問題是將如何云進行改革。或以為我國目前，旣無黃金，又少外匯，憑什麼力量去進行改革幣制？殊不知一國之財富，初不限於黃金與外匯。吾國歷史上，五千年來旣無大量黃金，更無所謂外匯，何以也有獨立的幣制？何以也可以躋國家於富强？近世史上也有一個國家，不靠黃金，不靠外匯，而能自力更生改革幣制，然後使財政收支平衡的，即使是一九二三年十月的德國。那時紙馬克已宣告破產，而幣制又一日不可缺少，於是工業界拿他們的工廠和機器，農業界拿他們的土地和房產，做成準備，發行一種「地租馬克」（Rentenmark）,結果居然成功。其成功的秘訣，即在動員實物（包括動產不動產），用作支付媒介（Mobilisierung　uon　Sachwerten　zu　Zahlungszwecken）；而其成功的條件，則在（一）組織嚴密碼，計算精確，（二）國際貿易，適逢出超，無外匯困難，（三）為民間自動的組織，所謂「地租馬克」，無法償地位，投機者對之，無法適用於他國。但是整理幣制不一定非靠黃金外匯不可，一切實物皆可以動員作發行準備，則不失是對於我國一種有意義的啓示。</p>
<p>總之，我國幣制改革問題，已到非解決不可的階段了！早解決一天，國家元氣多得保存一分，民生困苦多得解救一分；遲解決一天，國家元氣多損傷一分，民生困苦多增加一分。如不求解決，聽其自生自滅，深菵幣制終將有崩潰之一日，而國民經濟亦將遭受嚴重的損害！希望全國上下正視現實，及早注意及之。食米七千餘噸，自京趕運上海，圖示：下關江邊車站四周之大堆米包。</p>
<h3>津招待英訪華團</h3>
<p>（上接一版）彼稱，中國共匪應負破壞中國復與計劃努力之實。此輩共匪未可與其他國家之共產黨相比。英訪華團團長亞蒙稱，彼對於天津秩序井然之政府，印象極深。亞氏於答覆問題時又稱，若中國再度對外開放其內河航運，則中英兩國均蒙其利；因貴國之船％，並不敷用也。彼强調英國對航業有更多經騐，並對該企業有更多之投資。亞氏述及英國勞工情形時稱，勞資雙方已漸建立關於解決勞資糾紛所必需之機構。羅伯茲對於此方面曾指稱，過去兩年內所發生之罷工事件，實少於第一次世界大戰後所發生者，且英國所發生之罷工事件亦少於美國。</p>
<p>該團今下午舉行記者招待會後，即開始臨別鷄尾酒會，以招待天津市各界領袖。該團中團員二人，今晨曾參觀天津各醫院，其餘團員則與勞工領袖及天津市政府社會當局諸代表舉行一討論會。該團一行人員，在南開大學進午餐，團員羅伯茲，曾拜訪南開大學校長張伯苓。按張氏近患肺炎，刻在靜養中。麥克李維會對南開大學生發表演說，題為「英國自治之發展」。</p>
<p>〔路透社天津十九日電〕英訪華團今日下午出席市政當局之招待會，由津市參議會施議長致歡迎辭。施氏指出中國雖願在經濟上與英從事互惠的合作，但中國人民不能忘懷香港問題，希望訪華團予以注意。亞蒙勳得致答辭時聲明，此次來華純屬親善訪問性質，係以中國政府所邀賓客之身份來華。</p>

<h3>超額華僑離暹返粵</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷十七日電〕第一批超過規定數額之華僑五十五人（內地婦女及兒童），現乘「赫美林」號輪船暹羅，重返頭。彼等於其返國途中，將可憶及在暹所遭受有如犯人之痛苦待遇。按「赫美林」號於月前載此等我國移民前來暹羅，該輪業昨下午航離曼谷港口，我歸國僑胞係由武裝警察彈壓之卡軍送至碼頭，於上船之前，並經印手指紋等手續，多數男性均能面對其「命運」而保持鎮靜。但婦女目睹其若干貧窮親友，無力付出一千五百暹元存金在警署之後，目送伊等離去之情形，不禁泫然流涕。第二批超額我國移民，將於同樣情形下，即日送回汕頭。</p>
<h3>民盟勾結共匪擴大華南叛亂</h3>
<p>李濟琛等陰謀益積極</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕據確報，李濟琛等與民盟共匪軍事陰謀之合作更趨積極，其與民盟合作者為委派民盟之鄭坤廉為的民主聯軍第二軍軍長，鄭已選派大批軍事政治工作人員出發南路活動，其中以民盟之主幹第三黨（章伯鈞之農黨）人員為最多，共計廿四名。而鄭之與李合流，又係由共匪華南派員李濟琛之侄李諾夫所拉攏，其與共匪勾結者，除上所述派其侄李諾夫至粵桂，除上所述派其侄李諾夫至粵桂邊境收集鄭部外，又派陳毅之（陳炯明時代師長）鄭福康携款五千萬，至惠陽一帶聯絡共匪東江縱隊殘部。此外，為取得協調及行動統一起見，李與民盟共匪三方，曾於本年七月廿二日在香港九龍塘鄭坤豪宅舉行會議。出席者李方代表為雲應霖，共方代表為林平，民盟則由鄭坤廉親自參加，結果決定：（一）南路解放軍（鄭部）應改為民主聯軍，以資統一。（二）建立戰地委員會，以領導及委派戰地官吏。（三）從速組軍，俟有十團時，即調二團至三團向陽春以西發展，會後不久派兩團由莊田率領出發西江陽春活動，嗣又於七月二十四日李共雙方再度商討建立內地廣州附近指揮機關事，繼即派員赴內地視察，共方代表為方方，李方代表仍為雲應霖，直抵龍門從化交界之南汾山及和平之九連山兩地，企圖建立基地及組織聯合行動機構，以執行聯合命令。是故華南之叛亂行動，實失意軍閥民盟共匪沆瀣一氣之卑劣行為，惟華南社會人士早洞燭其奸，除少數慣匪外，均為買空賣空之勾當。</p>

<h3>琉球的過去和未來</h3>
<p>— 中央社</p>
<p>對日初步和會行將舉行聲中，處理日本本土以外屬領問題的討論，最近重又搬上國際論壇，在這一方面，我國所最關切的，是琉球羣島的未來地位，因為這個面積達二·三八六方公里的羣島，連貫了中國的台灣和日本的九州，在地形上它劃分了太平洋公海與黃海，在近代史上，它是日本南侵的梯航，這篇文字只是平日研究之一得，有歷史人種的追朔，有文化風俗的探討，俾我們對於琉球的未來地位，有個比較客觀眞實的看法。</p>
<p>蘆田均的「感情論」日外相蘆田均於六月五日招待外國記者團提出「日本意欲將日本周圍小島歸還與日，包括琉球及千島羣島中之若干島嶼」，跟着他還說了一句不算沒有趣味的話：「琉球對日本經濟並無十分重要地位，但為顧及日本之感情，故要求歸還」。</p>
<p>於此我們必須指出的是蘆田均的「感情」不幸是不大正派的，如同一個强姦，至少誘姦者的感情不大正派一樣，如其嚴格地依照他的「顧及感情」的說法，所得的結論，恐怕倒要傷及他的「感情」的那即是—琉球應還給中國。</p>
<p>從一三七二年說起我們不必否認法人萊馬奎（Le　M·rguie）及其附和者日人藤田豐八之說，以為我國隋唐，通典，宋元史中所載的「流球」「流虬」「瑠求」等名稱，並非今之琉球，而實為台灣之一部，我們也實無遠溯到公元六〇五年（即隋大業元年）之必要，我們只從十二世紀末期的信而有徽的琉球國王舜天（Shenten）以後起。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十入日電〕杜魯門總統今日發表內政部長克魯格關於美國資源與對外援助之報告，略謂美國可以實施二百億元之援助西隊方案，而不致使自身資源枯竭。此種方案可用加速進口之辦法抵消有助於打開世界經濟之優局，但國人倘不能與總統發起之節殺計劃合作，及若干出口管制倘不保留以免我國之鋼鐵被濫用，則上項偉大方案即不能成功。</p>

<h3>琉球的過去和未來</h3>
<p>（上接第二版）中央社</p>
<h3>這才是「感情」</h3>
<p>貢物的種類，據「中小世鑑」所載計有：馬·刀·金·銀·金銀粉匣·瑪瑙·象牙·螺穀·海巴·擢子扇·泥金扇·生仁·銅錫·生熟夏布·牛皮·降香·速香·檀香·木香·黃熟香·蘇木·烏木·胡椒·硫磺·磨刀石·我國政府的回贈，則有鍍金銀印（如康熈元年所頒王印上鐫「琉球國王之印」大字，乾隆時另頒新印，印文仍舊）冠帶襲衣·文綺·紗羅·錦縀·陶器·磁器·鐵釜·鈔幣·海舟·生夏布·　衫。絛靴。這樣的綿亘到將近五百年的封實行爲，幾乎是不帶一絲脅迫意味的純感情的結果。（大英百科全書琉球條，亦言中國政府自始至終，「決未企圖過把琉球置於軍事控制之下，」）反之，琉球王（如尚眞）一再要求打破兩年一貢的例，改爲一年一貢，「欲依中華卷顧之恩，在他國窺伺之患。」而中國政府（如明憲宗）始終願念遠人勞苦，朱予允准，中山王武寧某次進閥者數人於成祖，成祖命禮部退還，理由是「彼亦人子也，無罪而刑之，何忍。」禮部言恐阻遠人歸化之心，請但賜勅，止其再進，成祖不聽，下令立刻歸還。理由是「論之以空言，不若示之以實事，今不遣還，彼欲媚朕，必有繼踵而來者，天下以生物爲德，帝王乃可絕人類乎？」淸世祖時「免其貢馬著爲例，」聖祖時只令貢琉磺·海螺殺·紅銅。其餘「不係土產免其進貢。」至是琉球乃不必行咨滿刺加暹羅諸國准其採辦貢物，（咨文見日人安里延著「冲繩海洋發展史」中引有「切照木國貢物稀少，深爲未便」之語。）這裏面所蘊含的感情，大約不是做作得來的，從而我們到一六〇九年中山王尙寧，被日本俘虜時的一段記載:四十年（萬曆）倭入中山，裂執王（尚寧）不屈，倭酋異之曰，「有此氣象，無惑乎受天朝封號也，」卒放回。以至最末一個中山王尚寨在明治百端威脅之下，不肯填其「運願書，」即不向中國朝貢，不用中國正朔等，也就無所用其鶩訝了。而那位古倭酋（大約是德川家康吧）比之蘆田均恐怕倒眞够「感情」些。</p>
<h3>琉球人絕非日　本終裔</h3>
<p>我們試再從幾個角度，看看中琉之間的感情普遍的程度：</p>
<p>先看種族，日本侈稱舜天係日本人皇的後裔的話，是不大可靠的。大英百科全書琉球條云。</p>
<p>「雖然珠球的上流社會，跟日本肖似得厲害，但下級社會之間則有顯著的差異，在琉球人比日人矮點兒，但矮得合比例些，看起來比日本人順眼高額，眼睛不過分深陷的，臉不平，拱門樣的濃眉毛，更好的鼻子，隱然不著的胸骨，跟赫然耀眼的毛髮。</p>
<p>高額·深目·大鼻·跟耀眼的毛髮，領些無疑地都近乎南洋的馬來族，與日本人的細額短腿，比起來是連一點甥舅關係的痕跡也看不出來的。又據「朝野會載」（唐張驚著）記云：</p>
<p>「人（琉球人）形短小似崑崙，今亦有魁梧使偉者，首里·久米·泊·那霸·四村秀美尤多，姑米山所見，問有　頤修髯，殊類常夷」。</p>
<p>久米苜里（按爲王都）諸人漢人移居最多，「體頤修髯」顯是滲入漢族血液後所產生的人物。至於今日，中經多少世紀的滲透融台，這樣的人物業巳不復是「間有」而是普遍的了。</p>
<h3>語言文字</h3>
<p>次語文：琉球的亻（伊）口（羅）八（哈）等四十七字母，（外加「冫」合之四十八字）是仿日本書的，及反切速書，自都是以中國切書卅六字母爲藍本。但琉球原本有一種古文字，據元陶由宗儀云，「琉球國進貢中華，表文用木爲簡，高八寸許，厚三分，闊五分，飾以　　釦以錫，貫以革，而橫行刻字於其上，字體蝌蚪書」。顯然「依魯花」是後期日木勢力侵人後的東西。琉球上中國的「奏疏，皆中國書」「輿華人酬接，俱用模文」。草醫寫得很入格，乃至「與　素無異」。（「琉球無貴賤老幼，見中國人必出紙乞醫，不問其工拙，得使臣書，尤恭謹，俯身搓手高舉加額而後啓視」見「琉球國誌略」）。琉人程順則·蔡溫皆善罷文，眞常的「茶亭記」尤盼情多姿。</p>
<p>琉球和尙（著名的有際外·不羈·瘦梅·稱球·等）吟起詩來，據說還有唐人風味呢，（茲錄琉人程順則「東苑八景」之一「松徑濤聲」，以見一斑。「行到徂徠萬籟淸，銀河天半早潮生，細聽又在高松上葉葉迎風作水聲」。</p>
<p>琉球語言的來源，不甚可考，但難揉漢語則甚普遍。例如琉人稱妓女爲「侏　」「侏　」實即「傾城」二字之音。琉人喜用「　」一詞，爲最尊用語，（對華人不用）稱姓名爲「唐名」（中國政府賜與琉球人的卅六姓，以阮毛蔡金梁鄭林七姓最者，試看前表中琉使臣姓字，業已全然中國化了。）</p>
<p>琉球學校的敎材，是聖諭中國經書·及中國往來貢典之類。據載：「學校在入米村泉崎橋北聖廟東偏，蓄經書略備，國王又敬刊聖諭十六條，濱其文義，月吉讀之，官師則紫金大夫一員司之，每三六九日詣講堂，籍察諸生勤惰，兼理中國往來貢典。講解師則擇久米內文理精通者一人爲之，不拘大夫通事秀才皆可，歲廩十二名，訓詁師則擇句詳明者一人爲之，歲廩八石。首里亦設鄉塾三所，外村小吏百姓之子弟則以寺爲塾，以僧爲師，近那霸等村亦多家熟，讀書之聲有終宵郎郎弗輟者，殊可嘉也」（琉球國志略）。</p>
<p>道是說百餘年前之琉球的教育，幾乎純是中國化的了。至琉球遺華的留學生，從武寗遺從子「日孜每潤八馬」寨官子「仁悅慈」入國子監讀書，到南穆時止，據我統計有姓名可考的約四十三人，有女生（如姑魯妹）在內。（下援第五版）</p>
<h3>英國內外艦隊大事裁减</h3>
<p>〔路透社陶賽郡波特蘭十八日電〕此間官方證實：英國內體隊暫時將减爲巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦四艘，餘艦均予復員。此外樸資　斯司令部所屬之十二艦，以及國內他處襤隊司令部之若干艦，亦均予擱置。至於國外艦隊亦將大事裁喊，據權威方面息，在正常條件之下，擱置之各艦人員雖喊少，但在數日之內即可充分動員，惟以人力缺乏，當非目前所能辦到。波特蘭之主力艦訓練隊，包括主力艦「喬治五世」號，「安生」號及航空母艦「勝利」號，不受影饗。樸賽茅斯附近戈斯港之少年海軍訓煉所將十停閉。原定十月六日舉行之國內艦隊秋季演習，由於節雀燃料已予取消，原定參加演習者爲旗艦「約克公爵」號，以及巡洋艦驅逐艦等十七艘。</p>
<p>據泰晤士報海軍記者稱，英艦隊裁减以後，世界各部已無英國戰鬥主力艦，担任帝國之積極防務者，使爲散佈於五大區之小型航空母艦四艘。及巡洋艦十一艘。戰前國內艦隊有主力艦五·戰鬥巡洋艦二·巨型航空母艦二·巡洋艦六·驅逐艦廿八·潛水艇五。他體十九艘。又英國之最新萬噸巡洋艦「貝爾怯斯特」號亦已退出太平洋艦隊列入後備，太平洋艦隊將僅餘巡洋艦二或三艘。</p>

<p>公用局長趙曾珏爲徵收燃汕進口稅之從價問題，作最後之努力，於昨日上午訪晤財政部關務署長張福運，要求能否依公司合同價格徽收，以臧輕電力成本。據張署長解釋，海關收稅有一定規則，概依照上海批發市價徽收。海關認爲公司合同價格徽稅，將與其他收稅之　一辦怯有衝突，故在原則上有困難。趙局長於得悉海關之解釋後，認爲公用事業之調整價格巳不能再延擱，否則各公司將無法維持，遂決定今日上午再邀電力公司與海關交換意見後，即於下午招待記者公布調整之新價格。據趙局長告記者稱；如燃汕巡口稅依市價徽收，則上海電力公司每度電力之新價，將較原定之二千七百元再加三百六十元。但公用局總望能加得愈少愈好，以臧輕市民負擔。市府並將與財部洽商進口稅之稅率問題，及能否分期微稅，以喊輕公司之負擔。</p>

<h3>熊佛西播講怎樣看電影　故事人物結構精神都是電影主要條件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨假民聲電台舉行第廿九次星期日特別廣播，請市立戲劇實驗學校校長熊佛西播講「怎樣看多，市民也常常看電影爲經常的高尚娛樂。電影是第八稱藝術，究竟應當怎樣看怯，値得硏究。第一，是電影的故事，一般觀衆所注意的是趣味的故事，追求感官上的愉快，但是光有一個好的故事是不够的，遠要有其他的技巧配合。</p>
<h3>好與壞的區別</h3>
<p>第二，電影的人物，電影內面要有個性的，立體的，有血有肉的人物，提綫戲的人物是不能引起觀衆興趣的。第三，電影的結構，結構與故事不同，故事是有頭有尾的說明，至於情節如何安排，如何起承轉合，均須前後呼應，無懈可擊。所謂結構正如蓋房子，什麼地方應當開門，什麼地方應當開窓子，先要有一番佈置，電影也必預先佈局，才有完整的結構。第四，電影的精神，我們新過電影之後，覺得很好，或者覺得很壤，所謂好與壞是以什麼做標準呢？就看有無價值，看所描寫的題材是不是從現實生活裏提煉出來的。一個好的作家，製片商，導演，他總要找一個健康的主題，給與觀衆以精神上的啟發，一個觀衆在朱進電影院之先與爲過電影之後，在精神上必定有所改變，換句話說，進電影院的時候，精神空盧，看了之後，精神充實，這就是好的影片。至於故事一團糟，出現在銀幕上的是抽象的，傀儡的人物，內容是麻醉觀衆的，這種影片是不健康的，導引觀衆走向墮落的一條路，就是壤的電影。</p>
<h3>幾個次要問題</h3>
<p>以上是就電影的故事，人物，結構，稍神而論，還有幾個次要的問題：　演員的演技的問題，演員如果演得不好，也是不能構成優美的電影，演員有一個不好的傾向，專講「噱頭」，所調「噱頭」，就是以外形的，取巧的，不合理的，不健康的動作，以博取觀衆的一笑，不是發自內心的動作。內無所感，僅僅做出姿勢，是不能感動觀衆的。　畫面美的問題，電影包含有圖畫美，建築美，照表演來講，演員的面孔一定要對住觀衆，但也要看什麼情形，假如畫面是深藍的天空，明月高懸，窓中一對情人正在情話喁喁，如果兩個人背向觀衆，男的手慢慢的搭在女的肩上，這種畫面比較面孔對着覲衆更美。</p>
<h3>建設民族藝術</h3>
<p>音樂美的問題，普通對於演員的要求，是要口齒淸楚，每一個字能傳到聽衆的耳鼓，不僅聽得淸楚，還要有音樂節奏美，但也要看情形，如率衆怒吼的塲面，低音高音配合起來，雖不必聽得淸楚，但整個好像聽一支悲壯的曲子。又如一個人憤怒的時候，語音模糊不淸，格外能顯出力量。量後談到導演，在電影中，導演的地位高於一切，他的責任最大。</p>
<p>末了，我要請諸位注意的，中國電影己有三十年的歷史，雖然己經建立了不少成績，但是缺點仍舊很多，加之近來美國好萊塢影片充斥我國市塲，好萊塢雖有好的影片，但不健康的壞的影片太多了，以表演大腿色情爲號召，把我國觀衆導入不健康的歧途，這實在是民族的隱憂。我們要建設自己的民族的藝術，希望聽衆對於正在發展中的我國電影要好好愛護，如有意見，儘量寫出來，在報章雜誌發表，以作爲中國電影界改進的參考。</p>
<h3>特別廣播節目</h3>

<h3>行政不能統一</h3>
<p>諸翟位於上海巿之西，有北　公路可通，汽車行程約四十分鐘，鎮上有小學一所，居民八百餘戶，在遜情時設有「三界官」，蓋其地適爲嘉定，靑浦，上海市之分界處，每跨一橋或越一街，而省市之經界迥異，甚至一戶之間，而有上海市與嘉定縣之別者，因是行政之不能統一，治安之難於維持，將使建設不能進展，鎮民深以爲憂，而最近省市勘界時仍將諸翟分裂爲兩，內政部擬將蟠龍港北岸劃歸嘉定縣，致引起全鎮人民竭力反對，一再赴主管機關請願，要求改張申港爲滬市與蘇省嘉定縣之界該，將全鎭統一劃歸上海市。</p>
<h3>建議公民投票</h3>
<p>該鎭因因劃界問題已召開保民大會，推舉滬巿參議員侯雋人等表七人，據理力爭，列舉理由十四項，其中略調諸翟鎮風俗，民情，文化，經濟，習慣，均與滬市發生密切關係。以言交通，距滬市約廿華里，市府築有北翟公路，朝發午至，距嘉定則四十餘里，且無大道可通，由諸瞿往嘉是非繞道上海市不可，政令傳連之不便司知。該鎮民衆希望此次蘇滬劃界會中關於諸瞿鎮問題，能重視民意，作合理之解決，能建議必要時舉行公民投票，以解決隸麗問題。</p>

<h3>訪頭蓬災區　塘工局保坍工作印象記</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十日訊〕頭蓬鎭平安地渡過了七月中旬最大的「鬼潮汛」，居民們額手相慶，並且就在那工程房邊。他們於陰曆的七月十三，十四，十五，三天，特地做了三天戲文，慶祝工程處的成功。入月中旬，是今年最後一次大潮汛了，十八那天（十月二日），中外人士往海寗八堡去看潮的，還是「人潮大如海潮，人聲高過潮聲」，美國的柯克將軍還特地坐飛機後靑島趕來看潮。但記者爲了要看看人與潮的大搏鬥中，頭蓬究竟保得住還是保不住，特地趕往災區去視察了一週。</p>
<p>記者於中午時分到達頭蓬，首先映入眼簾的，便是那許多從房子巾拆下來的磚瓦，和巳徑拆了一部份而停止再拆的破屋。但是就在那些破屋的牆上，却新貼了好多紅紅緣綠的標語，在歌頌工程處和董處長他們的功績。走到江邊，遇到一個老翁，記者就問他</p>
<h3>坍江的情形</h3>
<p>他雖然看着江水遲遲地說：「從「昭和年代」坍起，七八年來，潮水巳候入十多里路了，我的家本來也在那邊。」我順着他指的方面看到，祇見一片浩浩江水，後浪撲着前浪，那裏還有房子和田地的踪跡，我又問：「坍去多少房子呢？」</p>
<p>「總不止四五百間吧，單是戶口也有十幾保人家呢！」</p>
<p>「現在他們住在那裏？」</p>
<p>「來得及拆屋的，賣了磚瓦，到外地另找生路去了，來不及拆的，祗够</p>
<h3>逃出一條命</h3>
<p>罷了，有的仍在四鄕種田，有的就窰居在親戚家裏。總算人命沒有捲進潮裏去過。」</p>
<p>就在我們正對面，海寗的鎮海塔隔江三十里，遙遙可見，那塔下，正擠滿了從各地去着潮的風雅土女，可是在這邊居的心情是多麽不同，眞是「一樣大潮，兩樣看法。」</p>
<h3>保坍工程處</h3>
<p>成立後，擇定頭蓬鎭東角先築丁　，大量桃石保岸，原計劃預備築丁壩三座，用石一萬公方，木籠一〇五只，護岸用石一萬入百公方，木籠三百六十隻，計需工款一，四九三，七八七，〇〇〇元，工賑麵粉七〇八，八七六斤，共需經費二，四六入，四九一，五〇〇元地方負担九億元，其餘由塘工局撥付。迄十月一日止，已拋塊石五，凡二七·四八公方，木龍五十餘隻，與大潮苦鬥半月，始打定基礎，保定不坍。但由於經費，材料，人力的限制，再加上物價上漲的打擊，工程僅限於東街。原計劃不能每只估價僅八十二萬三千元，現在單是木材即需一百廿五萬，再加上內裝石，外助石，共需三百九十五萬，而頭蓬</p>

<h3>琉球的過去和未來</h3>
<p>（上接第三版）　中央社</p>
<h3>生活習慣</h3>
<p>生活風習方面，毛舉若干例如左：</p>
<p>歷時凜奉正朔，貢使至京，必侯賜時憲書賚圓，元旦初六拜賀如中國，</p>
<p>五月五日競渡，（泊一，那霸一，久米一，共龍舟三）角黍浦，酒拜節同中國。</p>
<p>七月十五日盆祭祀先，匝祖神，亦有延僧作盂蘭盆醮祀者，放紙鳶不過在九月耳。</p>
<p>十二月初八，通國作糯米糕，三十四日送　，次年正月初五日還龜，一如我國，室內多奉神龕，以香爐置靑石其中，或云即祖神，又多以「天地君親師」五字供奉者，首里有「社壞」，豐見城有「雨壇」，首里畸山有「雲壇」，那霸有「雷神廟」，久米有「文廟」，大殿正中奉孔子神位像，兩旁二龕設四配位像，各手一經，那霸有「關帝廟」，（八廟內有王漁洋題字，及徐葆光製聯云：「赤心常掛扶桑日，正氣過時大海風」），龍神廟，水母廟一如中國，（以上見周惶琉球國志略）。「士大夫好奕，僧院輒以奕供客，有倦意，則援以枕，如十文具，中藏三四層，人各枕其一」，令人想起「棋聲花院閉」的中國高僧雅士的氣派。（張學禮使琉球紀）</p>
<p>士大夫無事輙敘飲，好以拇戰行酒，曼聲而謌，搊三絃和之……秋夜四望，絲竹盈耳，其中頗多唱中國絃索歌曲者。</p>
<p>（汪揖使琉球雜錄）</p>
<p>茶甌色黃描靑綠花草，甌上有朱黑毒不蓋，下有空心托子，甌頗大，斟茶止二三分，用菓一小塊貯匙內，此學中國獻茶法。　（徐葆光中山傳信錄）（餘不盡錄）。</p>
<p>琉球人的生活風習，自廣大的下級社會，以至士大夫階層，無不深刻而又普遍地浸淫著粘附著一種中國氣，正如前年四月十日路透社記者隨美軍在琉登陸之際，所看到的「處處都是以中國文化爲主的民族」，（路透社一九四五年四月十日冲繩電），這斷乎不是偶然，而是五六百年（至少）來中琉感情融透之自然的結果。</p>
<h3>日本的「感情」一斑</h3>
<p>反之，日珠的關係，從一六〇七年德川秀忠發兵强虜中山王尚寗以來，一直在無掩飾地在用著霸道，如强令琉球歸薩摩慕隸屬，千涉其財政，定琉球世子十五歲必遊鹿兒島（日屬，在琉球東北）之例，迨明治即位，（一八六入年）即迫琉球王承認日本爲上國，禁琉球朝貢中國，須使用明治年號，至於一八七四年（淸同治十三年）的因台灣生番杜丹族誤殺航海琉人，面日本得藉口製成的台灣事件，由英使咸德調停締結的含糊的中日三項和約下，日政府擅然把琉球劃歸日內務省管轄，和國內羣縣同例，迄至一八七九年（光緖五年），日人猙獰面目大現，發軍艦數艘正式收球琉爲冲繩縣，駕番王（即尚泰）上京，另設縣知事以治之，我國提出的抗議，直到今日已瀕百年，眞該是取得答覆的時候了！</p>
<h3>琉球的未來</h3>
<p>我們姑暫置感情不諭，即專就太平洋的整個安全著眼，琉球爲九州與台灣之問的擁有大小島嶼四百七十三個，面積達二，三八六方公里的一大羣島，是日本南進（侵）的梯航，同時，牠劃分了太平洋公海與黃海，有人至拿牠比擬作「韃　尼爾海峽」，去年十月曾一度醞釀過琉球主權問題，當時美國若干高級官員的見解是:「琉球羣島如果轉移主機，應當交予巾國，或將該羣島交聯合國委託管理，而由中國單獨執掌行政事宜，則美國亦將同意」，（見一九四六年十月九日聯合社華盛頓電）另一派美人的見解，當以葛勒五。（Grosoy）教授爲代表，葛氏在其所著「亞洲之地與人」一書中，論及西太平洋發生之問題時稱：「戰敗日本剝奪其爲侵略軍國之外國領土，當屬妥善之軍略地理，……如此實施，須交還台灣，（按：台灣已交還中國）琉球於中國」，（原書一章，太平洋盆地）</p>
<p>要之，此兩派雖著眼不同，但其主張歸還琉球於中國則一。我們深信這是正確的合時結諭。最近琉球崛起一支以喜又名為首的革命志士團體，掀起琉球人歸向祖國的運動，為了顧及五六百年來中琉之問的深透骨髓的感情關係，爲了顯及整個太平洋的安全，乃至全世界的安全，我們有理由與決心來呼應此一運動！（完）</p>
<h3>坍江最烈時</h3>
<p>房子連地皮祇賣到一百三十萬一問，因此，搶救費此所救的房子價值還大，而更糟的是南沙人自己不爭氣，董處長說：「他們不但九億經費一文不肯出，而且道德低下，沒有團結心，寗可坍了人家，再坍自己，不肯共同合作，去從事保坍工事。因此，坍江愈益猖獗。我們祗能照計劃救大局，西街那些受浪擊而小坍的地方，呌他們領了材料自己去做，也有人懶得帮鄰舍忙。目前可以自慰的，是在我們的工程以東地區，大潮已侵入一百五十公尺，其長度已超過頭蓬鎭蓬早已在鬼頭潮汛中坍去了」。</p>
<p>頭蓬本來是南沙的經濟中心，當地人號稱他爲「小上海」。坍江最烈時，一度形同死市，現在又活躍如前。（記者黃行天）</p>

<h3>紗廠向產區收購國棉　國行允許辦理押匯　每家最高押滙額不得逾二百億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巾央銀行總裁張嘉　於日前下午六時許，召集國民營紗廠代表談話，討論如何穩定紗價問題，迄八時許始散。據悉：討論經過，咸以爲目前紗價之未能繼續下跌，主因在棉花成本日益高漲。例如靈竇花衣，日來每担雖已跌至四五〇萬元，惟超出綿農實際成木仍遠。故決定新國營民營紗廠，中闡農民銀行，棉花商，在各產區收購棉花時，應組織聯合機構，聯合議定棉價，以維特綿農利益，勿抬高，勿搶臟，俾便棉價穩定。又各廠咸感收購國棉，缺乏資金。商討結果，張總裁允各收體國綿之紗廠，辦理押匯。以一萬錠以上之紗廠爲準，每萬錠約辦理押匯卅億元。惟每家最高押匯額，不得超過二百億元。待四聯總處核定後，即可照辦。</p>

<p>〔華東社〕　　會奉令舉辦木市紗布登記，業已完畢。玆悉該會尚將舉辦棉紗複製工業登記？以防杜囤積投機，并明暸棉紗消費情形。將先由滬市辦理登記，然後推行於其他各他區，以便寶行分配銷售。該會雷局現正依據經濟部規定之「調節紗布供需實施方案」積極計議中，不入即將賓行。又該會限制紗布存費以數量及存棧時期，各紗廠複製工廠所存綿紗，以足供給該廠三個月應用爲度。紗號存儲綿紗，不得超過四十五日。布商存儲布疋，不得超過其自報吒月銷售之兩倍。存儲紗布逾期逾量，除依城進價收購外，并依此州檢舉，均將依據「調節方案」實施云。</p>
<h3>本市汽油恐慌全係囤戶造成</h3>
<p>石汕公司負責人表示據中國石汕公司負責人談稱，本　汽汕之供應量，依　一實際情形而言，巳足够全市汽車之加用。目前所起之恐慌，全係一般汽車階級之心理作用，及一般囤戶收購汽汕，囤積居奇造成之。現雖田當局嚴加管制巾，惟汽汕之黑市，仍不能免。囤戶仍在暗中抬高售價，爲求澈底消減黑市起見，最佳之辦法爲澈查存量。凡各　商及有汽車之市民，均需限制是　其新有汽汕之存量。存量調查確實從，再作合現之支配，可收相當效果。如有隱匿不報者一，亦可採取獎勵密報辦怯破獲之，如此汽汕之供應情形，即不致再有恐慌。</p>
<h3>中信局決定人造絲配價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局前召開人造絲審價會議，決定本月廿日至廿六日，該局配務人造絲之牌價，計東洋大富貴一A六四八〇萬元，二A六三五〇萬元，三A六一五六萬元，四A五入三二萬元。天橋一A六四四〇萬元，二A六三一二萬元，三A六一一八萬元，四A五七九六萬元。其他一A六四〇〇萬元，二A六二七二萬元，三A六〇八〇萬元，四A五七六○萬元。</p>
<h3>津市棉布價格回落投機商號倒閉八家</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津十九日電〕津棉布價格，本週已由每疋九十萬之　價日漸回落。十八日中紡紅五福布市價已跌至六十六萬元。此間八家紗布號，因投機虧蝕，實告倒閉。其經理人亦由主管機關拘押。將依法予以嚴懲。</p>
<h3>杭市物價下跌</h3>
<p>抗州物價十八日普遍下跌，其原因由於上海此次施行物優特級檢查，投機商歛跡，市塲交易滯純所致。米價各　一致下跌三萬，上熟白米由六十萬四至五十七一萬，市塲交易大宗之　尖最高四一十八萬，次爲四十六萬五千。食汕劇瀉，每担各回一三十萬一元。花生汕一百八十萬，茶汕一百七十萬，菜汕一百五十五萬。絲綢紗布繼續貶值，廠絲每担六千四百萬，杭經絲四千八百萬，較之十七日各回二百萬。二十支天橋紗每件二千三百八十萬，十二磅龍頭細布每四八十五萬。</p>
<h3>捲烟包装纸昂貴　中小烟廠受威脅　每箱捲烟用紙已達一千厲元</h3>
<p>近日捲烟原料上漲之速率，最高者當推紙張類。捲烟製成品，雖以百物高漲，而亦隨之帶上，而其上昇之程度，絕不及紙類之飛速，以週來各項紙類之市價而論，透明紙每令自六百五十萬兀直昇至一千五百萬元，商標銅版紙自三百五十萬元直昇至七百五十萬元，民聲紙崗市價已達四千萬元一箱，其他包裝紙張，無不瘋狂上漲。據烟業中人稱；每箱捲烟及紙圈，商標紙透明紙鋼精紙等四項必需之一切成本，每箱已達一千萬元，烟葉尚未計算在內。普通中級捲烟，廠盤約在一千一百萬元間，故製成品之售價，已遠不及成本，此為中等已具實際銷路之　烟而言。至小型工廠，以牌子尙未遠盛銷之境，售更難提高。而各項原料之飛漲，使其成本日增無已，且小廠以缺乏大量炎金運用，尚須借貸鉅額之資金，故近日捲烟原料之飛漲，尤以中小型之捲烟廠，為最感痛苦云。</p>
<h3>捲烟工協會呈請增加紙圈外匯</h3>
<p>全國捲烟工學業協會，前爲解救捲烟需用隊料之困難，特其呈財政部，請求關於自備外匯之紙圈，鋼精紙，以及放寬各項原料之外匯限額等。茲悉：該會已舉財部核示，以各該項原料，自備外匯部分，政府已頒有實施法則，可遵照辦理。至放寬限額，仰即逕向輪營會請求核辦等語。捲菸協會，於昨日召開之常務理事會議中，以捲菸工業爲重工業之一，其出品爲民生日常不可或缺之必需品，且對政府所繳納之稅收爲各業之冠，政府當局實不能以之列入奢侈品或消耗品之類。現各捲菸工廠對紙　及鋼精紙之需要又最感迫切，故有呈請常局對現存關棧內自備外隊之紙圈等，准予提前辦理出貨之必耍，以免生產中斷，而影響稅收。至寬放外匯限額，現以捲烟之各項原料中最感缺乏者爲紙圈，每季限額中之七十八萬美元，內頤巾烟公司佔十萬美元，外埠各地捲烟工業佔十五萬美元，木市入十餘家捲烟廠僅佔五十三萬美元，與實際生產領相差極鉅。故放實紙圈外爾額實　急不容緩，決議請求當局增加紙圈外匯顯爲一百萬美元。設當局朱便增加外匯數額，則寗减少烟葉額以抵補紙圈額。因務葉可設法增產，紙圈在國內則一時尚不能增產云。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<p>黨國先進陳樹人先生早歲追隨　國父，從事革命與新聞事業，嗣後學成歸國，贊襄中樞，領導僑胞，抗戰前後，貢歡尤多。而平生精研文藝，言行如一，其詩書與繪畫已臻三絕，獨步一時。</p>
<p>陳先生亦嘗言從事藝術垂五十年，中間雖有政務覊身，未稍荒廢。並且對藝術素抱革新觀念，認爲藝術是創造的，進步的，如果陳陳想凶，便失去藝術的價值。於此更可以見到革命藝術家的革命精神和獨到的見解。</p>
<p>抑有進者，或許還有人主張藝術家應該爲藝術而藝術，甚至於威更有人將藝衛創作視同商品製造。但是陳先生則一貫主張藝術應以貢獻社會，負獻國家，貢獻世界爲目的。並一再提倡人格藝術論，認爲一切文藝創作均須以人格爲骨幹，作家首先要有麼問與道德的修養，然後才可以有偉大的收穫。此語與文黴明所謂「人品不高，用墨無法」，及王原祁云「學盡先貴文品」之說，若合符節，正是不易之論。</p>
<h3>陳樹人先生之畫</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>今讀陳先生所作「紅棉」「翠竹」「芭蕉」「柳禽」諸作，不特春光駘蕩，瀟灑絕俗，亦且飄逸高超，別有情致。人物如「驢夫」「苦力」，山水如「峨嵋」「劍門」「廬山」諸幀，俱多沉雄蒼茫，詩意盎然，若非以造化爲師者，決不克達此境界。蓋陳先生一向以讚美自然，頒揚勞動為其創作上之基調，無論詩文書畫，取材立意，咸依此基調爲準。益以淸風亮節之操守，恬淡謙冲之襟懷，觀其人則光風霽月，觀其畫則俊逸出塵，畫如其人，人如其畫，是人格修養的成功，也是藝術精純的表現。</p>
<p>陳先生的作品不但久爲國人所愛好，且早馳譽國際藝壇，今因陳先生即將在滬舉行畫展，不久且將籌備出國，滬上人士固可一飪眼福，而將來我國藝衛亦將藉陳先生之行而宏揚於海外。用綴數語，亦所以預爲我國民族藝術前途誌慶也。</p>
<h3>斯坦達爾的傳記</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>很少有作家像亨利白勒（Marie-HenriBeyle）那樣被回時代的人所忽視的，他的筆名時做斯坦遠爾（Stendhal　1783-1842）。他的兩部傑作，「紅與黑」（Le　Raugeet　le　Noir）和「巴姆城的修道院」（LaChartreuse　de　Parme），在商業上成功得很緩慢，又常被批評家所忽視。他那有名的文章「戀愛論」比弗洛以德早七十幾年，（弗洛以德稱他爲心理的天才）却只賣掉十七本。</p>
<p>直到斯坦達爾死後四十年，方纔有人發現他，被補爾惹（Paul　Bourget）和新心理子說家喝采，又受到左拉和自義主義作家的讀美。到了這時候，論到他的文實差不多和論拿破崙一樣多了</p>
<p>最近美國的瑟夫生（Matthew　Josephon）出版了一本「斯坦達爾傳」（StendhalA　Biographp），孟克里夫（C，K，Scott-Moncrieff）又把斯坦達爾的「阿爾曼斯」（Armance）也譯出來了。</p>
<p>「阿爾曼斯」精緻的研究性的袞退的人啊。紀德認爲這是一部被人忽視的傑作。此外孟兌里夫還譯有斯規遠爾根據十六世紀意大利編年史所改編的許多故事，所講的大都是熟情，盜劫，罪惡，復仇之類，頗値一讀，但並非斯坦達爾的代表作。遺本書的總名便呌做「斯坦達爾中篇小說集」（The　Shorter　Novels　of　Stendhal）。可惜他的自傳書信和日記還不曾翻譯出來。除紀德外，可說沒有一個作家像他這樣更多的坦白講到自己的。</p>
<p>約瑟夫生的傳記頗多新的材料。斯坦達爾不像巴爾札克或左拉那樣的著名，因此反而使我們有新鮮的感覺。</p>
<p>「紅與黑」是時代的眞實寫照，描寫內心的複雜亦極出色。兩派文學都接受斯坦達爾的傳承，一派是寫賓主義，還有一派就是心理小說。</p>
<h3>鳥的故事</h3>
<p>— 厂嵐</p>
<p>如果你感到這長夜的寂寞，那末，你把手中的書本放下，吹滅那盞搖曳的燭光，讓月光流進這間小房子來，我將爲你講述一個鳥的故事；雖然，我也會知道，還故事並不能把你濃濃的憂鬱冲淡。但除此之外，我實在沒有更好的方怯，來度過這寂靜而又煩躁的長夜。</p>
<p>那故事是這樣的：</p>
<p>許多奇異的鳥雀，據說都有他自己的一串傷心的進遇，像夜半泣血的杜鵑，和啼呌着「不如歸去」的楊殺六烏，都是如此。當沉默的黑夜，他們都盡情的歌唱着，好像藉着這種縱情無忌的歌聲，來宣洩自己的鬱結的憂傷。這裹我所要講的這個「芝蔴鳥」的故事，據說他有更悲凉的一段身世，所以他的啼喚，也是更悽愴的。</p>
<p>在一座遙遠的山城裏，很多年代以以前，山坳裏住着一家人，一個老婆婆和一個十五六歲的女兒，還有一個未滿週歲的兒子。按照這裹的風俗，在自己孩子還去買一個女孩子來做童養媳，而這個童養媳的年紀一定要比自己的孩子大得多；因爲一方面可以呌她來照料未成年的孩子，一方面可以任意地呌她做些濃家耕種的笨活計。「十八歲姐來週歲郎」——這個諺就是從那裏傳播出來的。我們這位老婆婆便用三十兩銀子，根據「週歲兩禮」的規矩，買來一個十五歲的女孩子，他們就是如此的一個家庭。</p>
<p>初來的童養媳，是多磨伶俐而又後倘的小姑娘啊！她會繡出各　大麗的花朶，她會把貧窮的家，用野花來裝飾得像個幽靜的恬適的仙窟；她會把破爛的衣服，修改補綴得那樣的整潔合體；在耕作的技巧，她會把那磨盤大的篩子。這是一件使男子漢都感到頭痛的工作，篩得的溜溜的旋轉。</p>
<p>相反的，顯得她的小姑，是那樣的懶惰與笨拙。</p>
<p>正因爲新來的的媳婦聰明，招來了小姑的嫉恨，常常在母親的面前，唆動許多自己編造出來的是非，婆婆是由鍾愛而漸漸轉變成的妬恨，討厭了。</p>
<p>——你不要睜大了眼睛，來叮着我。怎麼？你以爲這樣聰明能幹的小姑娘失去她母親的歡心是稀奇的麼？其實，假如你到那山中去住上週年半載的你便不會覺得稀奇了。因爲一直到現在都是這樣，事實告訴你，那裹的婆婆討厭媳婦，就好像我們每天應該吃飯似的平常；何况還有她自己親生的女兒，每天用許多謊話來誣陷她呢？</p>
<p>但是年輕的童養媳，是默默地忍受着這一切的非難與嘲諷，因爲她好像知道這是一種命運的安徘，是一種自然形成的不可抗拒的力量。她只有想用更勤儉和辛勞，來爭取一綫同情，她一天比一天更勤苦，更辛勞。而妬恨，虐待，嘲諷，這些魔鬼却更陰森地向她伸出魔爪，逼迫她走向生命旅程的盡頭……</p>
<p>她好像不感到這些惡魔對她的威脅，因爲在山城裘，這是一些太多，太平凡而又平凡的事。她唯一的希望便是她的小丈夫，快像筍子一樣快的成長，她可以從他的身上，獲到一些溫暖和憮愛。</p>
<p>「千年的大路踏成河，多年的媳婦熬成婆」，這就是山中流行的古諺，給予她的啓示。她茹苦含辛地，讓眼淚向肚裏流，耐心地等着春暖花開。而日子却走得比往昔好像更遲慢，一天一天地，魔鬼的利爪，漸漸伸向她的身旁，她的身體上烙上了一些被摧殘的傷痕。她看着自己的遠景，渺茫而不可捉模，甚至在這個世界上，自已活着都是那樣的暗澹和空虛。每想到這裏，放際的悲怨哭泣了。</p>
<p>白晝，黑夜，黃昏，黎明，在無光的生之路上，她失望地摸索着。</p>
<p>有一年，應該是芝蔴種下地的時候了。在晚上，婆婆交給她和小姑每人一升，在第二天黎明，要她們把它撒到田裏去。</p>
<p>妒恨的毒辣的小姑，在夜半披衣而起，把嫂嫂分得的一升芝蔴種，悄悄地放在鍋裏，燒起一把紅通通的火；第二天一淸早，她們把每人分得的一升芝蔴種都播種下地了。</p>
<p>日子一天一天的過去了，芝蔴地裏，一邊鑽出了鵝黃的新芽，一邊田裏却依然是黃橙橙的泥</p>
<p>『嫂嫂一定是個喪門星臨凡，要不？怎麼她和我種的一樣種子，怎麼不發芽呢』？小姑每天在婆婆的跟前嘰咕着。</p>
<p>可憐的童養妮，她每天仍然跑到田裏去耐心地等，等待着地裏的芝蔴芽，從泥土裏生長出來。但芝蔴却和她的女主人有同樣的命運，受到暴力的摧殘，永遠沒有出生的希望了。</p>
<p>婆婆向別人明理說：『媳婦不是喪門星臨凡，一定是掃帚星投胎』。</p>
<p>辱罵，毆打。對於她已經是最熟悉的事了。</p>
<p>終於在一個凄風苦雨的深夜，童養媳獨自模出了家門，向森林的深處走去。</p>
<p>這時，她已經無所顧忌，她感謝上蒼給她安排了這樣一個結束了痛苦生涯的歸宿。她誰都不裏一個多餘的人，世間上的所有，都在討厭她，不然爲什麼自己和小姑一樣的芝蔴種下地不出芽呢？想到這裹，她並不悲哀自己靑春花朵的凋謝，她只是感到對生活沒有一絲留戀，她愉快而又辛酸地去擁抱死亡。慢慢地，她的背影消失在墨黑的密林子裏了</p>
<p>第二天早晨，許多好奇的人們走到林子裏，圍攏着一顆樹，看着一個年靑的女孩子，筆挺挺地懸掛在枝椏上。昨夜的雨水，從她的憑亂的髮際，一滴滴地淌下來。好心的老太婆們，傷心地落下了同情淚。</p>
<p>據說人死後，她的靈魂可以揭穿生前許多不可知的詭秘與陰謀的，我們的童養媳，已經可以知道自己死去的無辜，和生前不幸的遭遇了，因此她的靈魂不甘地變成了一隻鳥，每當芝蔴下種的季節、她便夜夜飛到山中來悽愴地啼喚，至於來啼喚的原因，是想洩去心頭的積怨，還是冀求警惕一些和自己有同一身世的凄苦的人們呢？還是向她的婆婆和小姑作沉重的控訴呢？便沒有人可以知道了。</p>
<p>我的故事應該在這裏結束了，但是，類似芝蔴烏的賽苦的遭遇，一直到今天，仍然像惡性的蔓延植物一樣，在那對建意味濃一濃的山坳裏聲據着。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「您認爲我有這大的力量？」遣是銀羣的一個虛招。</p>
<p>「至少他們都有信託您！」「買」先生的態度很肯定。</p>
<p>「那麼，您對他們，爲了什麼感覺這樣大的興趣？」猶如鬥拳，虛招之後，耀羣給它一個黑虎倫心，兜胸一拳。換句話，要它「攤牌」。</p>
<p>「瞎，紀小姐，咱們雖說萍水相逢，轉眼也許就是天涯知己。」它換了一種低而沉的晉調像催眠術家在施衛似的；「咱們眞人面前不說似話，信不信在您……」它頓了一整，全副眼神注射着耀羣的面部：「鄙人可說是個沒有國籍的人，可是却有一個「宗教；」這宗教就是「同情弱者！」……您相信得過，咱們合作下去，不相信，咱們只能分道揚鑣！……再耍說下去，敝人仍舊是還兩句話。」它把最重要的秘密封鎖了！</p>
<p>相信？就憑它那一口七顯八倒的爛牙崗，耀羣也不敢相信。不過從它這兩句話，尤其是那「同情弱者」四個字裏，銀羣大約模淸了它的底子，雖沒十成把握，却也相差不多了。</p>
<p>「萬一漏了形跡呢？」耀羣乘勢，再它掏一下。</p>
<p>「告訴您罷，別設關內這幾個毛籮葡，就是關外總部，也沒有人敢動鄙人一下；鄙人的來路……可遠着哩！」</p>
<p>「喚！」耀羣準備冒險暫時利用它一下，却一時還想不出一種圓滑語句，表示雖然與它合作，却不讓它捉住任何把柄。</p>
<p>「您別三心兩意罷，小姐。敝人現在先到「行動總部」去走一趙，回頭十二點左右，咱們上南馬路吃館子去；連您那位令甥一起去。也許這一趟就是好消息。……</p>
<p>耀羣把天津這一段故事設到這裏，不知想着什麼，便瞧着小老虎一笑。這一笑，我才瞧明白她化裝的神妙；原來那付鄂齊雪白的牙齒，根木並未挪動或損毀，只加上一些化學顏色漆，黃藍黑各色都有，敷領在齒面上，乍一看去，就像一口爛牙，借着光色作用，還顯得長短不齊，殘缺不頓。</p>
<p>至於眼眉口鼻各部，似乎搬了地位的話，只有兩隻翠眼，確曾剪薙過了，還加染色。眉部一改動，面部當然變了大樣；再加用了那個什麼毛根草，皮膚確有些浮腫，又加了些火疗一類小刺瘡，因此顯眞做挪動了部位似的。但經我長入注視之下，覺得她那嫵媚的輪廓，依然存在。</p>
<p>這時我們幾個人，重在昌平聚首，她高與極了。說起天津這一路的故事來，竟忘了她的化裝，神態舉動，仍舊那麼天眞活潑，我覺得她並不像乍一看見那般醜陋</p>
<p>「也是由於我神經過敏，」銀羣繼續說：「想到虎弟這孩子，絕對饒那人妖買沙夫不過，所以想設法讓他們暫時不對面。先還以爲虎弟就要到旅館來，只消跟他一鏡明，讓他另找住處，暗通消息就行了。誰知等到快十一點，人影都不見，只好乘傢伙還未回來，快想辦法？……　　鸕鶿筏　（桂林風景）　陳樹人</p>

<h3>燦爛的今日科學</h3>
<p>— 張大燕</p>
<p>瞻望未米，科學的進步，　是一件最令人鶩奇，喜悅的事；可是今日的科學上的進展迅速，使人難以預測；正有訐多不必等待到明天才看到明天的美麗和動人，驚人的建樹也正在今日的科學園地襄茁長。</p>
<p>原子能的應用，無疑是明日的科學最燦爛的一部分，而電子學在今日，也有同樣偉大的成就，尤其在是超短波（Ultra-shortWave）方面。使我們有了和月球通訊的可能，也帶來最奇妙和最有用的工具—電子顯微鏡，對一切科學和工業上的研究付與了最大的助力，讓人類看到以往不可看見的微小的世界，電子顯微鏡三萬倍的放大度，使放大一千倍的光學儀器和能放大三千倍的紫外綫顯微鏡（Ultra-Violet　Wave　Microscope）顯得渺小。在這裹，科學家開始眞正實地去觀察物資分子的工作。更爲細菌學，金相學（Metallugraphy）開熊了新的天地，成爲今日科學所最有效的工具。</p>
<p>偉大的成功，也將是人類和疾病的格鬥，進步的磺硫製劑（Sulfa-drugs）配尼西林（Peincillin）和綜合抗瘧製劑（SyntheticAnti-malarials）挽回了許多名醫東手的疾病。但致命的疾病仍是很多，科學家的工作，依舊絲毫不能放鬆。</p>
<p>最近在可能有二千種配合的磺硫製劑裏，除了已應用的五種外，其餘的都在倣製造和試用的工作；配尼西林的另外四種，配尼亞林FGK和X正在五萬種靑黴素（Green　moldo）中提鍊出來應用，許多藥物的率運着的發現和製造，這將使藥物學家，生物學家，醫學家從現在起，忙上多少年。</p>
<p>石油工業，是人類最重要的工業，可是在以往，我們仍只有二個簡陋的方怯—那便是加熱和蒸鋼。可是工業科學家早已指出不同的分子組識，對汽油的品質有極大的影響。不論用在汽車威飛機上，含有高辛（Octane）態多的汽汕，揮發品性最佳，能免除內燃機問題中最討厭的敲整現象（Knocking）（這是由於汽汕點火與自發的着火爆炸同時存花，故互相推撞，發生每平方吋一千磅以上的壓力，危害引擎。品質優良的汽汕能耐高壓縮而不自燃。）</p>
<p>因比，在今日更加了許多的新手續如氣氧處埋（Hyorogenation）觸媒分裂法（Catalytic　Cracking）同素異形化和多鹼手績得以取得適當的分子組織，而改進引擊之經濟度和安全度。</p>
<p>一般人所最未淸楚認識和分析的便是塑料和線合橡膠（Plastic＆Sythetic　Rubber）來作爲我們的有用材料，雖然他也正有不少缺點，不能去做一輛完全「玻璃」的汽車或機械；可是在一部分的用途上，比別的材料更爲適宜。最近汽車內部的着火系採用此種原料，非常適合。在耐溫方面，也有了改良，已能忍受自華氏七十五度至五百度的各種溫度，一種稱爲「織維玻璃」的（Fibcr　Glass）正是解決了發電機，馬達麻一煩的絕蘇問題的好材料。</p>
<p>現代的科學，賦子了冶金工業以豐富的活力，使這自遠古時代已開始研究的科學，始終動人，因爲我們對一切金罷材料的要求，正是毫無壓足，需要他的負重度一天增加一天，希望他來駕馭應大的原子能，責任的重大，不難想像；超速的飛行，不但要高强度，高　性，更耍輕。一切的一切，都需要進一步的冶金研究。</p>
<p>而X射綫照相使冶金學中的觀察方法成爲專門的學問，電子顯微鏡更使科學家去觀察分子的組織。這些就是今日千萬種合金和合金鋼的品質能負起重任的動力。</p>
<p>龐大的飛翼，最新式的機械，如電子轟擊機，電子顯微鏡，不都是「人類的材料」製成的嗎？</p>
<p>是了，美麗和動人的世界，不都在明日，也在今天，你試看科學園地裹的燦爛之花，正在科學家的努力灌溉之下盛開着！</p>
<h3>能</h3>
<p>— 朱學潤</p>
<p>「能」，對於我們日常生活中，所接觸的一切，有很密切的關係。例如，家用的電燈，電爐等器具。是拿一種「電能」，轉爲「光」或「熱」的「能」，使我們很方便的亨受；其他的，當然也不過是同樣的，輸流不息着的在用出「能」，同是應用「能」。所以「能」的知識，頗可使人從日常的生活實臉中學習，由學習而打成它；但是一定也要有基木上的知識才可。</p>
<p>最顯著，同時最可使人覺察的「能」。是一種「機械能」。——拿手猛推一物，那末這物體，如果是靜止的，就會向你推的方向，開始行動，經過相當的距離，物體才靜止。——如果拿「機械能」的定律來講；因爲依照生頓力學第二定律，物體在靜止狀態時，設牠的質量爲日，受衝以後，就有能够運動的速度（F-=m.v），物體有了速度（V），就具有了一種「動能」（K.E.＝1/2mv2）；既有了「動能」，如果没有受其他外界的力的影響，物體是永遠保有這「能」，換句話設，物體是永遠保持還原有的速度，運動不息着的，但事實上，受了空氣的阻力，以及其他的力，如舉擦力類，結果，使物體靜止了。但物體是已經移動（S=1/2mv2.1/F）到你的目的地了。</p>
<p>喉　所以能發出聲音，也就是聲帶的激烈振動，而這時四週的空氣，已有了一種「波能」，由此而向外散開去，於是再來觸動耳朶的彭膜；所以我們日常耳朵來聽聲音，全靠着「能」在空氣中的傳遲工作。</p>
<p>來打着一根火柴。——由於物質間的互相摩擦而發生了相當的「熟量」，結果，一球很明亮的火焰產生了。要知道「熟」是「能」的一種，道一種「熟能」在轉變爲另一種「光波能」的時候，火柴頭就起「燃燒」了。但是「光波能」是什麼？「燃燒」一是什麼？……我們所以「看」一出燃燒的火炬，是由「光波能」的能够傳達到，同時透過我們的眼，刺激到網膜上而起的光感。火柴的餘燼，當然是碳，以及其他的雜雜質，然而，一枝木枝一經燃燒而爲碳以及其他物質，這是歸於「化學能」的變化。</p>
<p>以上看來，「能」已有好多種，但是「能」的種類很多呢，還有「位能」「電能」以及「原子能」。然而耍疑問，「能」有這多種，是從什麼地方得來的，爲什麼用了這數萬年的長時間，老是用不完？</p>
<p>太陽的「輻射能」，投射於地球表而，就有種種物體來吸收牠，同時也就變遷爲種種的「能」。在輻射錢射到地球的過程中，由於氣體把某一部份的散亂而成爲漫射光錢，由於漫射的不均，地面上各部份的受熱，也因此而不均，遂使大氣中有了壓力的差異，於是有風的形成。平日，利用風而代替人力的，如帆船，風打車類等，都在應用太陽的「能」。常輻射綫投射河，海的水面上，蒸發出水蒸氣，再在天空中遇到寒流的打製，於是成了爾，雪，霜，雹的降到地面上來，因爲寒流的吹襲，有一個範國，以致某區就有了高水位的「位能」，常水向四週水位較低的衝流下去的時候，就變爲「動能」，</p>
<p>科學玩意</p>
<h3>人造雪</h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾祺</p>
<p>在無聊的時候，讀者可在家中自製人造雪，既饒佳趣，又富科學意未，不妨一試。用具：安全火柴一盒，銀幣一塊，碘（Iodine）少許閃光燈一具。環境：具有冷空氣的緊閉處，最好有黑色的四壁襯托，則製成了小雪片比較容易顯現。</p>
<p>步驟：　在火柴頭上醮酒一滴。將它在銀幣上磨擦，火柴頭上即有少許銀質黏着，　将火柴擦着，當燃燒时，烟中即含有極微細的碘化银（Silver　iodide）結晶。</p>
<p>在冷空氣中（低於華氏十度），用口吹之，，呼出的水氣溫度驟低。　水氣在碘化銀的微粒間，在閃光燈照耀下，即出現光亮的雪片。普通的室溫難得華氏十度以下的溫度，可在下列諸條中試其一：　在家用的食物冷凝箱內；</p>
<p>用一大空瓶！以木桶置多量乾水圍住，臧低它的溫度（注意切勿用手直接接觸乾氷﹞；　寒峭的冬夜，在緊閉的車廂內或相似情形之處。這樣製成的髯在室內觀賞，頗有寒意。于是可利用這「動能」（也可稱水力）來發電，「常能」再可變爲「機械能」而來供給工廠以交通上的需要。</p>
<p>植物受到投射下來的輻射綫，就起光合作用，可以吸收空氣巾的碳酸氣而分解出「氣氣」，同時以碳素爲構成自體的主要成分，故燃燒木材時，所得的「熱」與「光」，亦無非是「太陽能」的再現，故植物的生長，拿「能」的觀念來講，就是使「太陽能」變爲「化學能」而貯藏之作用。動物是拿植物及其所生成的氣氣爲營養原料而生活的，所以「太陽能」也就推移進動物體內；在前幾段所說，「手猛推物體」「手打火柴」「震動聲帶」和「聽聲音」，都是人在用他所得的這「太陽能」。推想到古代，動。植物的遺體在地層中，就變成了今日的各種礦物；故礦物的「能」，亦不外乎古代太關投射於地面上時，所蓄積的「能」。可知地面上所有的一切現象，大都由太陽發射而來，所有的「能」頗可歸入「能」，不過是時常在改變「她」的面目，是永遠不減。當然如果太陽的「能」完了，地球上就再也受不到「太陽能」，那時，地球上不能再有人類的生存了。所以我們可以盡量利用，地面上一切物質所具有的「能」，例如：德國在第二次大戰中，發現拿液體燃料的蒸氣和汽油，作一種發射藥，結果，就有可怕的V-2火箭問世了。美國採用「原子能」變成許多共他的「能」的原理，產生了咸霞全球的原子彈。「能」的力世，委實是該人，所以我們生在這二十世紀的科學時代巾，好再蒙蒙的忽視這「能」嗎？</p>
<h3>原子能會使人類絕種</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>在今年九月出版的「原子學會公報」上，美國印地納大學的茅萊博士（Dr.　Hermann　J.Muller）會者文警告道，假定先沒有原子彈來毀減了幾百萬人，人類自己也會慢慢不知覺的被原子能所毀減。茅萊教授是去年諾員爾生物學獎金的獲得者，他根據了實騐，認爲平時應用的原子能，會使細胞質內的遺傳因基發生突變（Mlutation），可使生育變成不可能，人類將有絕種的危險。</p>
<p>人類，動物和植物的生殖細胞內都有極微小的質點（遺傳因基），當因基變質或毀壞時，就發生「突變」，這種突變强烈的可以使下一代失去生育力，普日通這突變是暫時潛伏在訓胞質內，一次次的和異性生殖訓胞質的突變因基結合，終而顯現出它的影響。茅萊博士之所以得獎金，就是他曾用「X光綫」照過果蠅的性器官後，牠就生出許多奇形怪狀的怪胎米，這證明「X光錢」是會毀減生育的。不過果蠅生代短促，很快就顯現出惡果來了，人類也許要經千百年後才能顯現出，但茅萊博士認為到了那時，每一個後代都因受道古遠的遺害不是自己死去，也會失去生育的能力，讓人類整個毀滅</p>
<p>他常說：一些醫師們很容易的可以使「X光綫」　離性器官，防止毀滅生育，但原子能的危險遠超過X光，它內面也有「r光綫」（Gamma　rays），一個原子彈爆炸後，直接的殺死了十幾萬人，而却另外又給生還者們種下了這種「因基突變」的毒果，一代代這樣傳播到整個人類以直到大家毀滅了事。戰事如比，平時就用原能也是一樣。因之，茅萊博士大聲疾呼了，一旦原子能能够直接大量利用了，如何去消除和防止這些附帶而來的放射光綫是今日急待解決的問題，過去僅用鉛幕來隱蔽人的生殖器官以防止X光綫，到現在顯然是不够的。更可怕的，是因為這種侵害太慢，不容易察覺，而它的惡果也只在若干年後才出現，於是一般人就疏忽了道一個可怕的人類勁敵，要知道這點小影響會一次次的結合擴大，一代重覆一代以至道「突變」整個摧毀了人類的生育機構時，才起來防止，那時已晚了。</p>
<h3>突變是化學性的改變嗎？（一續）</h3>
<p>— 郝天和</p>
<p>第一次CIB試在結果所產生的致死因基，作了遣傳的分析研究之後，才知道其中有此致死因基，是由於榮色體的改組而發生的。這面由同里欽斯基博士（Dr.Slizynski）作了細胞學的檢查而證明的，染色體因芥子氣的刺激而生改組，已成事貿。在一九四一年十二月又做一種特別的試騐，他們所設計的方法，是着重在染色體位置的互換（Translocation）如兩色染色體，互相交換一部分，不過自動的互換，在正常情形下是很少的，但面芥子氣有力量使染色體發生改組，已無疑問，在八百十六個被試驗的細胞核之巾，有七個發生互換，有一　關於這種試驗結果的報告，於一九四三年三月呈送到供勝部，但是所有類似的工作，當時都不能出版，因爲芥子氣麩種毒氣，有關戰事之故。後來關於染色體的互換以及其他式樣的改組，又做了許多的試騐，所有這類的研究都用果蠅作爲進一的材料，這是值得注意的。一九四三年戈勒（Koller）博士應用紫鴨跖草（Tradescantia　Virginica）的花粉母訓胞，作細胞學的研究，完全證實了芥子氣能便染色體發生破裂與改組。</p>
<p>芥子氣和X光綫對於遺傳的影響，頗有相似之處，是很明顯的。不過慢慢的還可以在這兩種作用之間找出某種的異點，這種異點，也許是很有興趣的，因爲化學和物現的突變素經過比較之從，也許更有希望去理解突變的問題，第一種異點發見在互換的現象中，X光綫所引起致死因基的出現率，和X光綫所引起五換的出現率面隨着光綫的强度而直接增加的。互換出現率是相當於光度的3/2th”，的力量，結果在X光綫的某種强度（以雷琴Rantgen單偉　算）之下　　　的致死因基與互換的數量之問，成立了一種數字的關係，在三千電琴單位的X光綫，就能產生近於百分之九的性迎致死因基。及近於百分之六的互換。這些互換是介於果蠅第二和第三染色體之間。經過芥子氣處理以後這種數量的關係就很顯著的推移到性連致死因基方面去了，在芥子氣的試騐中，本來可以期望有百分之六的互換，現在郤祇有百分之點五的互換，產生於第二和第三染色體之間，在遙種試騐中所產生的性通致死因基，還是百分之九，在繼續的試驗中，發見互換的百分比也有同樣比例的减低。這種觀察好像是指示芥子氣破壞染色體的效率沒有X光綫那樣强，但是耍提出這個結論，需要愼的考慮，必需記着我們所用的方法，還不能探求染色體被破壞的確實情狀，現在只能知道改組從的比例數罷了。我們可以推想，經過了那種化學性的處理，也許要妨碍染色體斷片改組的步驟，因此既有一定數目的斷片，而改組究成後的數目，將比X光機處理後的爲少，關於這一點還需要特別的試驗來證明，才可以不結論。社會服務</p>

<h3>External Adoption of Various Opinions in Preparation for the Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan; Wang Shijie to Leave New York Today for Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The political, economic, and diplomatic subcommittees of the External Review Committee for the Treaty of Peace with Japan have been meeting almost daily for the past week. The opinions of relevant agencies, experts, and public opinion are deeply valued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have been largely adopted. For example, Premier Zhang Qun's proposal to recover Ryukyu, as reported to the Resident Commissioners of the Political Council on the 18th, was a solemn decision made after consulting various parties. The deliberations of the Review Committee have covered all possible issues. It is expected that the draft Treaty of Peace with Japan, prepared by our country, will be as perfect as possible, supported by the people, and valued by the Allied nations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 18th, United Press] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie is scheduled to take a flight from New York via Tokyo to return to Nanjing at 4 p.m. on the 20th. Chinese sources only said that official duties in Nanjing were busy and required Mr. Wang to handle them, but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] The most well-informed sources here believe that the hope of convening a preliminary conference on the Treaty of Peace with Japan before the beginning of 1948 has been dashed. As a result of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's repeated talks with U.S. officials over the past two weeks, China's opposition to the U.S. position on voting procedures may be overcome in the coming weeks. It is reported that China has obtained assurances from the United States that U.S. regulations after the signing of the treaty will not harm China, but China cannot change the U.S. position that Japan should be allowed to have a permanent economic standard equivalent to that of 1930-1934. The opinions of China and the United States on the total tonnage of merchant ships that Japan should have differ greatly. There is no hope of reaching a compromise on this matter before the formal holding of the conference. At the same time, some here believe that when the four powers meet in London on November 25, the United States will use this opportunity to once again persuade the Soviet Union to participate in the conference. However, if the Soviet Union continues to refuse, the United States will proceed with the convening procedure when China expresses its willingness to participate.</p>
<h3>Our Commercial Representative Speaks: Japan Should Revise its Trade Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Tang Jiusheng, the Chinese government's commercial representative, stated: Unless Japan revises its trade policy toward China, barter trade between our country and Japan will be impossible. If Japan reverts to its pre-war policy of dumping cheap and unnecessary goods into our country's markets, it will destroy any possibility of establishing friendly commercial relations between the two countries. Mr. Tang, who arrived here last week, emphasized that future Japanese exports to our country should be limited to machinery and tools and other items, as such exports will help our country build its production capacity and contribute to the recovery of our national economy. Mr. Tang suggested that industrialists and traders in our country should formulate countermeasures for the mutual exchange of raw materials and finished products between China and Japan to guide the re-establishment of commercial relations between the two countries. Currently, trade between the two countries is hampered by the lack of U.S. dollars in both countries. Our country has already exhausted the amount of foreign exchange used for imports. Mr. Tang revealed that there are no U.S. dollar deposits available to purchase Japanese goods until our country announces the amount of foreign exchange to be used for imports in the next season. Mr. Tang also pointed out technical difficulties, such as trade and currency exchange formats, payment methods, and other obstacles to trade between the two countries. Unless these obstacles are removed, private traders in our country will not be able to come to Japan to conduct sales or purchases.</p>
<h3>The Question of Recovering Hong Kong Can Be Resolved Reasonably; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Replies to Inquiries from Senators</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Regarding the question of recovering Hong Kong, senators previously raised inquiries with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently replied, stating that after the further strengthening of Sino-British relations, the Hong Kong issue can be resolved reasonably. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Sino-British relations have become increasingly friendly over the past year or so, and the British government has also paid close attention to the national aspirations of the people in British-controlled areas and will use this as a basis to change its past policies.</p>
<h3>The Macau Issue: To Be Raised in the Future</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Regarding the issue of recovering Macau, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had discussed it with the Portuguese side several times when China and Portugal negotiated the abolition of the unequal treaty. However, the Portuguese side has always insisted on not discussing it, and according to the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of 1887, Macau is "permanently managed" by Portugal with our permission, and its nature is different from that of a leased territory, almost equivalent to a ceded territory. In view of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this matter should not be left pending for a long time, otherwise it will delay the abolition of Portuguese consular jurisdiction in China. Therefore, it has first signed an exchange of notes with the Portuguese side to abolish the above-mentioned privileges, in the hope that when negotiating a treaty in the future, we can still raise the Macau issue and seek to adjust general relations. Our negotiations to purchase aircraft from Canada have been completed and delivery methods have also been decided.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 18th] Canadian newspapers reported today that the Chinese government's negotiations to purchase approximately 150 Mosquito fighter-bombers from Canada have been completed, requiring a total payment of approximately 10 million to 12 million Canadian dollars. The procedure is as follows: China purchases aircraft from the War Assets Corporation for a price of 5 million U.S. dollars. The aircraft will be transferred by China to Havilland Aircraft Company in Toronto, and will be adjusted according to the contract, requiring an additional 5 million to 7 million U.S. dollars. Havilland Aircraft Company delivers the goods to China.</p>
<h3>Former Polish Ambassador to the United States Advocates Immediate Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 18th] Former Polish Ambassador to the United States, Tytus Filipowicz, recently stated in a speech to the Republican Club here that the United States should immediately provide China with its full "military, political, and economic" assistance. He said: "We must not let the misfortune of Poland be repeated in China. The time to help China is now." It is noted that Mr. Filipowicz is currently applying for U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 19th] The Manila Chronicle reported in detail today that if the United States believes that China is currently capable of rectifying itself and therefore abandons its determination to help China, it will inevitably make a big mistake and regret it. The Soviet Union may take its place and succeed.</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Allocates 500 Million for Emergency Relief to Yantai and Weihaiwei; Yantai Performing Arts Circles Stage Public Performances to Cheer Up the Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch of the 19th] It is learned that the Provincial Government has recently received a telegram from the Executive Yuan, approving an emergency relief fund of 3 billion for the cities of Yantai and Weihaiwei. Before the funds are allocated, the Provincial Government is allowed to advance 500 million yuan first.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 19th] Yu Jimin, Director of the Eastern Shandong Administrative Office, recently received an order to travel to Yantai on behalf of the Central Government to express condolences to the 180,000 citizens who have suffered for ten years, and to convey the Central Government's deep concern.</p>
<h3>Central Air Transport Plane Missing En Route from Shijiazhuang to Beiping; Search Has Been Underway for Two Days with No News Yet</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A C46 type T-38 transport plane of the Central Air Transport Corporation disappeared over the Communist-controlled area while flying from Shijiazhuang to Beiping at 2 p.m. on the 17th, and has been declared missing since then. As of the 19th, its whereabouts are still unknown. The plane was piloted by American pilot Moore, and also carried co-pilot Mao Xinshen and telegraph operator Zheng Fengtian. It was carrying four and a half tons of cotton and one ton of cloth. After the plane went missing, the Central Air Transport Corporation immediately telegraphed the local governments of Jin, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, as well as the Air Force, the General Air Transport Brigade, and the China National Aviation Corporation, to assist in the search by air and on the ground. However, the search planes could not fly too low in the area, for fear of being shot at by Communist guerrillas on the ground. Chen Wenkuan, the chief of the flight group of the company, personally went to search, and has now returned to Shanghai. According to a telegram from the General Air Transport Brigade in Beiping, the personnel are feared to have been captured by Communist guerrillas.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 19th] The Central Air Transport Corporation dispatched five aircraft on the 19th to search for the C46 plane that has been missing for two days. [Central News Agency, Yantai, 19th] All theaters in Yantai have reopened. To celebrate the restoration of Yantai, members of the city's performing arts circles will jointly stage public performances for five days starting on the 19th to cheer up the troops.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Periphery of Weihaiwei; Defending Troops Repel Invading Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 19th] More than 10,000 bandits from the Fourth Brigade of the Shandong Police Corps and the militia have been attacking the periphery of Weihaiwei for days, but have been bravely repelled by the defending troops. The bandits reinforced their attack on the night of the 18th, and fierce fighting has continued until this morning. The defending troops have been extremely successful, and the Air Force has also assisted in the battle from the air, halting the bandits' offensive. A full-scale counterattack is currently underway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 9th] The bandits from the 37th and 38th divisions of the 13th Column, and the Jiaodong Garrison Battalion and the Nanhai Independent Regiment, who were defeated in Lingshan, were pursued and surrounded by the National Army near Shuigoutou, and the entire Jiaodong Garrison Battalion was annihilated, with more than 100 bandits captured.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The repair work on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway is being actively carried out. The railway and platforms between Nanquan and Lancun in Chengyang County have been completed, and military trains will officially run on the 20th, with one train each way per day.</p>
<h3>Public Security Team Recovers Fenglingdu with Great Success; Luoyang-Zhengzhou Section of Longhai Railway Opened to Military Traffic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] The National Army, striking eastward along the Longhai Line from Tongguan, launched a surprise attack on Pantouzhen with overwhelming force. The bandits fled at the sight of them, and the National Army has now entered Pantouzhen. More than 300 Communists stationed at Fenglingdu were completely annihilated by the Public Security Team jointly organized by the people of Yicheng, Jiexian, and Yongji counties on the 15th, and the area was recovered on the same day. The remnants of bandits east of Xiaolingguan and the eastern part of Sanyaosi (southeast of Weinan) on the border of Shaanxi and Henan have been swept away by the National Army for days, and there are currently no traces of bandits in the area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 19th] The Luoyang section of the Longhai Railway, which was repaired overnight by the railway staff, was officially reopened to traffic on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Kong Lingrong Goes to Western Shandong to Supervise Dike Restoration Work</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch of the 19th] Kong Lingrong, Director of the Shandong Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, flew from Jinan to Xu by plane on the 18th due to the opening of the situation in western Shandong, and then transferred to the Linpu and Zhukou areas of southwestern Shandong to continue supervising the dike restoration work.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Far East Regional Committee Holds Closed Meeting; Director Rooks to Address Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Major General Rooks, Director of UNRRA, will attend the 35th closed meeting of the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee at the Bank of China Building at 10 a.m. this morning, and will address the meeting.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Timing of Currency Reform</h3>
<p>In recent months, special prices have soared endlessly, the purchasing power of the legal currency has become increasingly low, and inflation seems to be approaching a malignant stage. As a result, the issue of currency reform has once again become the focus of discussion; everyone believes that currency reform is absolutely necessary, but opinions on when to reform the currency are still not unified. The theme of this article is to explain that currency reform has now become a matter of urgency. The earlier the reform, the more likely the currency system can be saved. The later the reform, the more unimaginable the economy may be. Please explain the reasons as follows:</p>
<p>According to the Central Bank's Financial Weekly, the special price index in China, in the week of September 29th to 14th, the Shanghai wholesale special price index has reached 4,903.121; in other words, it is more than 40,000 times that of the pre-war period (1937). Generally speaking, it can be said that prices have risen to 50,000 times (in fact, it may be more than this number). To know the extent of the current price and currency malignant inflation in China, it is best to compare it with the situation of the German mark in 1923. German paper marks have depreciated year by year since the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, and the situation is similar to that of the current legal currency in China. If calculated by the annual average, the number of paper marks equivalent to one gold mark (that is, the normal value of the mark) is as follows: It can be seen that the paper price of the mark is getting faster and faster. Take the end of each month in 1923 as an example, the paper marks for each gold mark are as follows:</p>
<p>Therefore, in fact, by October 1923, the paper mark had completely collapsed. If the current price in China is calculated at 50,000 times, then one yuan of legal currency before the war is approximately equivalent to 50,000 yuan of legal currency now, which is equivalent to the situation of the German paper mark in June and July 1923. If currency reform is not implemented as soon as possible, the collapse of the legal currency may become inevitable.</p>
<p>Some may think that the German government deliberately let the paper mark fall in those years, intending to eliminate it to eliminate its debts, while the Chinese government is still trying to maintain the legal currency, which seems not comparable. In fact, the depreciation of a currency has its natural trend. At a certain stage, its depreciation power is very large, and it is almost impossible to contain it. Therefore, regardless of whether it is intended to eliminate it or to maintain it, when the depreciation of a currency has reached 50,000 times, currency reform must be carried out as soon as possible to stop the malignant inflation from becoming more serious and to avoid economic collapse.</p>
<p>Some may think that the conditions for currency reform are not yet available, so the timing of currency reform is not yet ripe. But if the legal currency really collapses one day, will the conditions for currency reform be available? If it is not available by then, how will the government handle the aftermath? Others may think that there are three types of imbalances at present: first, the fiscal revenue and expenditure are unbalanced; second, the international balance of payments is unbalanced; and third, the production and consumption are unbalanced. As long as these three imbalances exist for one day, the currency system cannot be reformed for one day. In fact, this view is wrong, and unfortunately, this wrong view is mostly held by the current financial authorities. Because under the current continuous depreciation of the legal currency and continuous inflation, these three imbalances will only become more serious: first, the fiscal revenue and expenditure are unbalanced, which is already very serious, but if prices continue to soar, expenditures continue to increase, and inflation further expands, the vicious circle will become more and more intense, and the fiscal revenue and expenditure will only become more unbalanced! Because tax revenue will never catch up with prices (the reason is that tax revenue should not compete with prices, and it is impossible to catch up with prices in terms of time and technology), and public bonds cannot be issued, the result is only relying on inflation, and the vicious circle will only increase without end. Second, the imbalance of international balance of payments is also the result of inflation, not the reason why inflation cannot be contained. Under the current foreign exchange management system, hoping to receive more remittances from overseas Chinese and hoping to increase exports may have become completely useless, because the so-called listed market price and the black market must still have a considerable distance, and the so-called "absorption of overseas Chinese remittances" has proven to be a complete failure. As for increasing exports, in the situation that the domestic price level has long been higher than the world market level, how can we really find a way to increase exports? The so-called Foreign Exchange Balance Fund Committee only follows the black market's rise and has no ability to "balance" exchange rates! If the value of the legal currency continues to fall, even if the government uses all its might, we will only see the black market for gold and banknotes still soaring, and we may not be able to hope that the international balance of payments can tend to be balanced. Third, the imbalance between production and consumption, "reproduction" has long been unable to proceed, coupled with the destruction of industrial and mining enterprises, the destruction of transportation, and the stagnation of transportation, how can production be increased? Public and private are in trouble, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, and most people are already struggling on the hunger line, "thrift" does not need to be talked about to them! The legal currency has plummeted, and people's minds are worried about the morning and evening. People are rushing to buy supplies and use money for fear of being too late. What about savings? To wait for production and consumption to be balanced, international balance of payments to be balanced, and fiscal revenue and expenditure to be balanced, and then to reform the currency system, is really the so-called "waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long will people live?" On the other hand, if the fiscal revenue and expenditure can really be balanced, the international balance of payments can be balanced, and the production and consumption can be balanced, then it is "peace in the world", the legal currency is omnipotent, everything is on track, and why should the financial authorities bother to reform the currency system again?</p>
<p>The big mistake of this popular concept at present is that it mistakenly believes that these three imbalances are factors hindering currency reform, and does not know that currency inflation is the main cause of these three imbalances. To balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, balance international balance of payments, and balance production and consumption, we must first stop currency inflation; and to stop currency inflation, we must first reform the currency system. This error in popular conception commits the mistake of putting the cart before the horse. Unfortunately, this wrong concept is coming from the financial authorities, so one mistake is repeated, and the economic problem becomes more and more serious!</p>
<p>Since currency reform is imminent, the question is how to carry out the reform. Some may think that China currently has neither gold nor foreign exchange, so what strength can be used to carry out currency reform? Little do they know that a country's wealth is not limited to gold and foreign exchange. In Chinese history, for five thousand years, there has been no large amount of gold, let alone foreign exchange, so how can there be an independent currency system? How can it also make the country rich and strong? In modern history, there is also a country that does not rely on gold, does not rely on foreign exchange, but can rely on its own efforts to reform the currency system, and then balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, even in Germany in October 1923. At that time, the paper mark had been declared bankrupt, and the currency system was indispensable for one day, so the industry took their factories and machines, and the agriculture took their land and real estate as preparation, and issued a "land rent mark" (Rentenmark), and the result was successful. The secret of its success lies in mobilizing physical objects (including movable and immovable property) for payment media (Mobilisierung uon Sachwerten zu Zahlungszwecken); and the conditions for its success are (1) strict organization and precise calculation, (2) international trade, just in time for surplus, no foreign exchange difficulties, (3) a civil automatic organization, the so-called "land rent mark" cannot compensate for the status, speculators cannot apply it to other countries. However, tidying up the currency system does not necessarily have to rely on gold and foreign exchange. All physical objects can be mobilized for issuance preparation, which is still a meaningful inspiration for our country.</p>
<p>In short, the currency reform issue in our country has reached a stage where it must be resolved! Solving it one day earlier will save one more point of national vitality, and relieve one more point of people's suffering; solving it one day later will damage one more point of national vitality, and increase one more point of people's suffering. If we do not seek a solution and let it die on its own, I am afraid that the currency system will eventually collapse one day, and the national economy will suffer serious damage! I hope that the whole country will face the reality and pay attention to it as soon as possible.

<h3>Tianjin Hosts British Delegation to China</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) He said that the Chinese communists should be held responsible for destroying China's efforts to revive the country. These communists should not be compared with the communists of other countries. The leader of the British delegation to China, Amon, said that he was deeply impressed by the orderly government of Tianjin. When answering questions, Amon also said that if China reopens its inland waterways to foreign shipping, both China and Britain will benefit; because your country's ships are not sufficient. He emphasized that Britain has more experience in the shipping industry and has more investment in the business. When Amon mentioned the situation of British labor, he said that both labor and management have gradually established the necessary mechanisms for resolving labor disputes. Roberts pointed out in this regard that the number of strikes that occurred in the past two years was less than those that occurred after the First World War, and the number of strikes that occurred in Britain was also less than in the United States.</p>
<p>The delegation held a press conference this afternoon, and then began a farewell cocktail party to entertain leaders from all walks of life in Tianjin. Two members of the delegation visited Tianjin hospitals this morning, and the other members held a discussion with labor leaders and representatives of the Tianjin municipal government's social authorities. The delegation had lunch at Nankai University, and member Roberts visited Nankai University President Zhang Boling. Zhang has recently contracted pneumonia and is currently recuperating. McLeavy gave a speech to students at Nankai University entitled "The Development of British Autonomy".</p>
<p>(Reuters, Tianjin, 19th) The British delegation to China attended a reception held by the municipal authorities this afternoon, and the Speaker of the Tianjin City Council, Shi, delivered a welcome speech. Shi pointed out that although China is willing to engage in mutually beneficial economic cooperation with Britain, the Chinese people cannot forget the Hong Kong issue and hope that the delegation will pay attention to it. When Lord Amon delivered his reply, he stated that this visit to China was purely a goodwill visit and that he was visiting China as a guest invited by the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Interview with Mayor You Mijian of Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) He said: "Taiwan has been lost for half a century and has tasted the pain of being trampled by foreign races. Every year we celebrate the Retrocession Day, which is tantamount to celebrating the new life of the Taiwanese people." He continued: "The first significance of expanding the celebration of the Retrocession Day this year is to promote mutual understanding between Taiwan and the motherland. The Taiwanese people now yearn to understand the motherland, and people in the mainland should also learn more about Taiwan. Taiwan Province has convenient transportation. If many private individuals or groups from the mainland can come to Taiwan during the Retrocession Day to visit the construction of Taiwan Province and visit Taiwanese compatriots, it will definitely make a great contribution to cultural and situational exchanges. We have now done our best to prepare various exhibitions, and the exhibition time lasts for one month. We urgently hope that people in the mainland will come to Taiwan for sightseeing and live up to our wishes."</p>
<h3>National Money Dealers' Congress Concludes</h3>

(2) It is hoped that the competent authorities will reduce the tax rate at their discretion to relieve the heavy burden. (3) Money firms should go deep into the grassroots and take the vast rural areas and the vast crowd as the focus of contact. It is also hoped that the government will strengthen active guidance and simplify management methods so that the financial industry can have the opportunity to develop freely. (4) Remind colleagues to broaden their horizons and look far ahead, to assist in the advancement of all industries under the strict compliance with national laws and regulations, to seek the welfare of the people, and to further assist the country in stabilizing finance to save the crisis of economic depression. (5) In the future, we will plan to cultivate talents, improve the quality of practitioners, use scientific management methods, cater to the trend, and improve the organization to enhance service efficiency.</p>
<h3>YWCA Closes Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Excess Overseas Chinese Leave Siam to Return to Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Bangkok, 17th) The first batch of 55 overseas Chinese (mainland women and children) exceeding the quota are now on the "Hermelin" ship to Siam to return to their home. They will be able to recall the painful treatment they suffered in Siam like prisoners on their way back to their country. The "Hermelin" ship carried these Chinese immigrants to Siam last month. The ship left Bangkok Port yesterday afternoon. Our repatriated overseas Chinese were sent to the wharf by armed police escorts. Before boarding the ship, they also went through procedures such as fingerprinting. Most of the men were able to face their "fate" and remain calm. However, the women could not help but shed tears when they saw some of their poor relatives who could not afford to pay the 1,500 Siamese yuan deposit at the police station and watched them leave. The second batch of excess Chinese immigrants will be sent back to Shantou in the same situation.</p>
<h3>Democratic League Colludes with Communists to Expand Rebellion in South China</h3>
<p>Li Jishen and others are increasingly actively conspiring</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th) According to reliable reports, the cooperation between Li Jishen and others and the military conspiracy of the Democratic League and the Communists is becoming more active. His cooperation with the Democratic League is to appoint Zheng Kunlian of the Democratic League as the commander of the Second Army of the Democratic Allied Forces. Zheng has selected a large number of military and political workers to set off for activities in the southern part of the country, most of whom are members of the Third Party (Zhang Bojun's Agrarian Party), the backbone of the Democratic League, totaling 24 people. Zheng's affiliation with Li was facilitated by Li Nuofu, the nephew of Li Jishen, who was sent by the Communist Party in South China. His collusion with the Communists, in addition to the aforementioned dispatch of his nephew Li Nuofu to the border between Guangdong and Guangxi to collect Zheng's troops, also sent Chen Yi (the teacher of Chen Jiongming's era) and Zheng Fukang with 50 million yuan to the Huiyang area to contact the remnants of the Communist Dongjiang Column. In addition, in order to achieve coordination and unified action, Li and the Democratic League and the Communists held a meeting at Zheng Kunhao's house in Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong on July 22 this year. The representatives of Li's side were Yun Yinglin, the representatives of the Communist side were Lin Ping, and the Democratic League was personally attended by Zheng Kunlian. As a result, it was decided that: (1) the Southern Route Liberation Army (Zheng's troops) should be renamed the Democratic Allied Forces in order to achieve unity. (2) Establish a war zone committee to lead and appoint war zone officials. (3) Organize troops as soon as possible. When there are ten regiments, two or three regiments will be transferred to develop west of Yangchun. Not long after the meeting, two regiments led by Zhuang Tian set off for activities in Yangchun, Xijiang. Later, on July 24, Li and the Communist parties again discussed the establishment of a command organization near Guangzhou in the mainland. Then, they sent personnel to the mainland for inspection. The representative of the Communist Party was Fang Fang, and the representative of Li's side was still Yun Yinglin. They went directly to Nanfen Mountain at the junction of Longmen and Conghua and Jiulian Mountain in Heping, attempting to establish bases and organize joint action agencies to carry out joint orders. Therefore, the rebellion in South China is actually a despicable act of collusion between disgruntled warlords, the Democratic League, and the Communists. However, people in South China have long seen through their treachery, and except for a few habitual bandits, all are empty deals.</p>

<h3>川黔湘 Highway</h3>
<p>Severely Damaged by Mountain Floods</p>
<p>Currently Under Repair and Improvement</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 19th] According to Director Xiong Zhefan of the Fifth Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, upon his return from inspecting the Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan Highway, he stated that this year's mountain floods were unprecedented, causing severe damage to the highways under his jurisdiction. The Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway suffered the most damage, while the Sichuan-Kangding Highway was less affected. The "Lianghekou" section of the Sichuan-Hunan Highway was completely washed away on both sides. The highway between Chengdu and Guanghan (measuring sixty meters in length) was almost turned into a riverbed. The Bureau is currently dispatching personnel to inspect and repair the damaged areas. As for the reconstruction of the "Zhu Hao Bridge" on the Sichuan-Hunan Highway, it is expected to be completed by the end of the month, while the "Zhuantanhe Bridge" is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The Meizi Pass and Baima Mountain highways, due to their high altitude and narrow roads, are considered a concern for military transportation and will be improved. It is reported that the Bureau's future central tasks will include: (1) organizing the road surface within its jurisdiction, and (2) repairing dilapidated bridges, striving for consolidation and durability.</p>
<p>Pei Wenzhong Returns to Lanzhou from Lintao: Many New Discoveries in Prehistoric Archaeology</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th] Dr. Pei Wenzhong, commissioned by the Central Geological Survey to conduct prehistoric archaeological work in Gansu, returned from Lintao. He told the Central News Agency reporter that during the four-month trip, he traversed the Miao River, the West Han River, the Tao River, and the Daxia River, collecting over twenty boxes of specimens. He discovered over ninety prehistoric human settlement sites, of which over ten are of significant value and should be excavated on a large scale immediately. Among the discoveries are various types of white pottery, black pottery, white and black painted pottery, and stone tools of unknown use, all previously unknown. Furthermore, he discovered ancient human "limestone dwellings," each with a square shape measuring approximately three meters on each side. The floor of the room was plastered with limestone, making it quite smooth, with a circular pit in the center for lighting fires. In one excavated limestone dwelling, human bones, pottery, and bone tools were discovered, confirming that its era predates the Han Dynasty, roughly corresponding to the last phase of the three major divisions of pottery culture, or possibly being a product of the original culture of the Zhou people. The discovery of this dwelling is of great significance to ancient Chinese culture. The Central Geological Survey has decided to continue this work next year. People's Movements</p>

<h3>The Past and Future of the Ryukyu Islands</h3>
<p>— Central News Agency</p>
<p>As the preliminary peace conference with Japan is about to be held, discussions on handling the issue of territories outside of mainland Japan have recently resurfaced in the international arena. In this regard, what China is most concerned about is the future status of the Ryukyu Islands. This archipelago, spanning 2,386 square kilometers, connects China's Taiwan with Japan's Kyushu. Topographically, it divides the high seas of the Pacific Ocean from the Yellow Sea. In modern history, it served as Japan's stepping stone for its southward expansion. This article is merely a reflection of daily research, tracing its history and ethnicity, and exploring its culture and customs, so that we may have a more objective and truthful understanding of the future status of the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>Hitoshi Ashida's "Sentimentality" Japanese Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida, during a reception for foreign journalists on June 5, proposed that "Japan intends to return the small islands surrounding Japan, including some islands in the Ryukyu and Kuril Islands, to Japan." Following this, he added a somewhat amusing remark: "The Ryukyu Islands are not of great economic importance to Japan, but to consider Japan's sentiments, we request their return."</p>
<p>Here, we must point out that Ashida's "sentiment" is unfortunately not very upright, just as the sentiments of a rapist, or at least a seducer, are not very upright. If we strictly follow his "consideration of sentiments" argument, the resulting conclusion might hurt his "sentiments," which is—the Ryukyu Islands should be returned to China.</p>
<p>Starting from 1372 We do not need to deny the claims of the French scholar Le Marguie and his Japanese supporter Toyohachi Fujita, who believed that the names "Liúqiú," "Liúqiú," and "Liúqiú," recorded in Chinese historical texts like the "Tongdian" of the Sui and Tang dynasties and the "History of the Song and Yuan Dynasties," did not refer to the present-day Ryukyu Islands but were actually part of Taiwan. We also do not need to trace back to the year 605 AD (the first year of the Daye era of the Sui Dynasty). We will only start from Shunten (Shenten), the Ryukyu king of the late twelfth century, whose existence is historically verifiable.</p>
<p>From Shunten to Shunmashunxi, Yiben, Eiso, Daisei, Eiji, Tamagusuku, and Nishi, a total of eight generations spanning 163 years, to Satto. The twenty-third year of Satto's reign, which corresponds to the fifth year of the Hongwu era of the Ming Dynasty (1372), officially opened the page of "Sino-Ryukyuan tributary history." (The Ryukyu entry in the Encyclopedia Britannica also uses this year as the start date of China's Jnvasion of Ryukyu. Although the year is not mistaken, the word Jnvasion is an inaccurate misuse of historical facts.) In that year, Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty sent envoy Yang Zhanmai with an edict to his younger brother Taiki, who presented a memorial with local products. The wording of this first edict from the Chinese emperor to the King of Ryukyu was very grand. Recent articles on Ryukyu in various magazines have already quoted it, so we will not repeat it here. We will only quote a memorial and an edict from the Ryukyuan "Chuzan Seikan" itself to get a general idea:</p>
<p>In the autumn of the twenty-first year (of the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty), the envoy reported: "My Ryukyu kingdom has been divided into three for over a hundred years, with endless wars and suffering among the people. Your subject, Bashi (grandson of Satto), unable to bear the sorrow, sent troops to unify the north and south mountains, now bringing peace. I humbly beseech Your Majesty to uphold your rules and grant me the title of successor, and I respectfully offer local horses and products." The Emperor of the Great Ming bestowed upon him the following: "Your Ryukyu kingdom has been divided, and the people have suffered for over a hundred years. It is your righteous army that has restored peace, which is My long-held wish. From now on, be cautious from beginning to end, and forever safeguard the sea territory, and let your descendants preserve it. Respect this decree." (Note: Ryukyu was thus unified from three parts.)</p>
<p>A Tribute Table From Satto to the last king, Sho Tai, a total of twenty-seven kings (or excluding Sho Shishō, which is incorrect), except for Sho Sen'i (younger brother of Sho Iku), who reigned for one year and died before requesting investiture, and Sho Kin, who died before requesting investiture at the turn of the Ming and Qing dynasties when he was still the crown prince. The remaining twenty-four kings received investiture from China. Recent people have listed this in detail (see "Observer" Volume 2, Issue 22, but that table omits Sho Shishō, which is incorrect). We will not repeat it here. Here is a separate tribute table:</p>
<p>(Note: The table on the right is based on the "History of the Ming Dynasty," the "Veritable Records of the Ming Dynasty," and Zhou Huang's "A Brief Account of the Ryukyu Kingdom." I do not have the "Draft History of the Qing Dynasty" on hand, so the names of the envoys and the number of missions from Sho On to Sho Tai will be supplemented later.) (Continued on Page 3)</p>

<h3>Left and Right Factions Engage in All-Out Struggle: Municipal Elections Begin in France; Results Will Determine France's Political Direction</h3>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcast: Paris report, France has been divided into two camps, one being the Communist Party and the other being five parties opposing the Communist Party. The municipal elections currently being held in various parts of France are sufficient to determine France's future political direction. All countries in the world attach great importance to this.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] People across the country began electing city councils today. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party are vying for leadership. The results of the election will test their strength. Paris will elect nineteen city councilors. Due to transportation strikes in the city, only a few workers arrived at the polling place by bicycle or on foot. However, the turnout in the suburbs was very crowded. President Vincent Auriol and his wife also appeared near the Champs-Élysées early in the morning to cast their votes first. Prime Minister Paul Ramadier flew back here after voting in Chatellerault to deal with labor disputes. The head of the Paris General Confederation of Labor, Communist Party member Henri Reynaud, announced that a meeting will be held tomorrow to decide whether to implement a general strike.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 18th] National municipal elections in France will be held on the 19th. On the eve of the municipal elections, the French Communist Party is eagerly seeking to launch a general strike. This election will determine whether France will fall into the hands of the Communist Party this winter. Approximately 36,000 cities and towns across the country will elect their local councils on the 19th. The Communists and the anti-communist faction led by Charles de Gaulle are fighting to win the election.</p>
<h3>UN Political Committee Passes Resolution to Establish a Small General Assembly; Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia Refuse to Participate in the Work of the Group</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th] The UN Political Committee continued to debate the US proposal to establish a 57-nation standing committee on the 18th. After the Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko detailed the Soviet Union's objections, the Political Committee passed the resolution to establish a subcommittee to study the US proposal by a vote of 38 to 0, with four abstentions.</p>
<p>The Slavic bloc of countries has consistently refused to participate in the voting, and the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, which were elected as members of the subcommittee, have also declared that they refuse to participate in the work of the subcommittee.

After the issue of the standing committee has been temporarily resolved, the Political Committee will begin discussing the Soviet Union's accusations against "war mongers" and "war propaganda" next week. At the same time, the UN General Assembly is scheduled to reconvene at Flushing Meadow next week to make a final decision on the Greek issue.</p>
<h3>Debate on the Palestine Special Committee Ends; Husseini Opposes Partition</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] The UN Palestine Special Committee concluded its general debate today and will discuss special proposals in the future. Arab representative Husseini spoke first today, opposing partition, stating that a small Jewish state of millions of people in the heart of the Arab world has no chance of survival. The Arabs of Palestine will never give up any part of their national territory under any pressure. Jewish representative Chaim Weizmann followed, stating that the partition of Palestine is the only practical compromise to avoid stalemate and destruction.</p>
<h3>Wallace to Travel Abroad to the Holy Land for Inspection</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 19th] Former US Vice President Henry Wallace stated that he will soon travel to Palestine to see if his agricultural and industrial knowledge can facilitate the promotion of peace. Wallace said that he supports the partition of the Holy Land, but is unwilling to elaborate on the possible military intervention by Arab countries after the partition.</p>
<h3>United Nations Considers Establishing a Middle East Economic Commission</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] The Egyptian delegation today submitted a proposal to the Economic Committee requesting that the Economic and Social Council consider establishing a Middle East Economic Commission. The tasks of this commission are generally the same as those of the previously established economic commissions for Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun stated that he welcomes this resolution because several underdeveloped regions in the world urgently need industrialization. Zhang urged the subcommittee to pay attention to the fact that the establishment of regional commissions cannot be regarded as a "permanent" measure, because this measure is incompatible with global economic unification.</p>
<h3>UN Economic and Social Committee Approves Financial Agreement; Soviet Request to Abolish is Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th] The UN Economic and Social Joint Committee today approved the agreement established between the United Nations and the International Bank and the Monetary Fund by a vote of 29 to 4, with two abstentions. The Soviet Union, which is not a member of the International Bank and the Monetary Fund, accused the two institutions of lending based on political motives and of having become branches of Wall Street. New Zealand joined the Soviet Union, Belarus, and Ukraine in voting against the proposal, while Australia and Yugoslavia abstained. The anti-construction iron proposal submitted by the Soviet Union, which sought to abolish the current drafting agreement and have the Economic Committee reopen negotiations with the International Bank and the Monetary Fund, was rejected by a vote of 29 to 5, with twelve abstentions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, St. Louis, Missouri, 18th] Vice President Garner of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development stated here that the World Bank will not be able to provide the $3.1 billion in loans listed in the Paris Conference report for the purchase of heavy equipment.</p>
<h3>UK and US Agree on Reducing Tariffs</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 19th] According to British spokesman Herbert Butler, the United Kingdom and the United States have reached an agreement on the main points of reducing tariffs.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Harold Wilson, the chief British representative attending the trade negotiations in Geneva, returned to the country to consult on the reduction of imperial trade preferences and US tariff concessions, and flew back to Geneva from London on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Truman and MacArthur Modestly Decline to Run for President Next Term</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] According to Senator Brooks, President Truman once made a joke, willing to hand over his position to General MacArthur, but MacArthur was unwilling to accept it. Brooks told reporters that President Truman had expressed his complete confidence in MacArthur before he went to the Far East in mid-July last year. At that time, President Truman leaned back in his chair and said with a smile: "Tell MacArthur that I am already tired, and he can have my position anytime, anywhere." Brooks conveyed the President's words to MacArthur, and MacArthur replied: "Tell the President that if a general were to run against him for president, it would be Eisenhower, not MacArthur."</p>
<h3>European Requests for US Aid: The US Government is Capable of Meeting the Demand; Not Only Will It Not Be Reduced, But It Will Be Increased Instead</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Government officials said today that the United States should not only not reduce the $22.4 billion under the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, but should increase it. This matter is only a possibility at the current research stage. On the other hand, federal financial experts have expressed deep concern about this possibility, and are seeking to reduce the amount of the original plan in order to submit it to a thrifty Congress.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] President Truman today released a report by Interior Secretary Krug on US resources and foreign aid, stating that the United States can implement a $20 billion aid program to the West without exhausting its own resources. This plan can offset the favorable situation of helping to open up the world economy by accelerating imports, but if the people of the country cannot cooperate with the president's proposed austerity plan, and if some export controls are not retained to avoid the abuse of our country's steel, then the above-mentioned great plan will not succeed.</p>
<h3>US Congressmen Advocate for Swift Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, October 18th] A committee of nine US congressmen, headed by Congressman Sautter, returned home on the 18th after investigating Europe for five weeks. It is said that the world they saw is a world of sickness and suffering. The Marshall Plan for aid to Europe or other similar plans should be considered immediately. It is said that Europe has fallen into a chaotic and difficult situation under the offensive of communism. In order to prevent Europe from collapsing completely, American aid must arrive as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Scheduled to Return to His Post Today</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Walter Bedell Smith met with President Truman for 45 minutes today. He will leave for Moscow via London on the 20th to return to his post. Lieutenant General Lucius D. Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Europe, will also return to Germany on the same plane.</p>
<h3>The Strength of the Arab Allied Forces Should Not Be Underestimated: Hashimi Appointed Commander-in-Chief; An Egyptian Battalion Deployed to the Border of the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The Palestinian Arab newspaper Al-Wida announced that the former Iraqi Chief of Staff and Prime Minister Hashimi has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Arab Armed Forces. The Arab League meeting held in Lebanon last week revealed that the strength of the Arab Allied Forces is approximately 220,000 men. The northern border of Palestine is currently defended by the British-trained Transjordanian army, and it is rumored that Arab troops are conducting exercises in Syria north of Lake Tiberias.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 18th] An Egyptian Defense spokesman recently stated that an Egyptian battalion has been ordered to deploy to the Irarihi region on the border of Palestine to replace the local garrison. This mobilization has nothing to do with the Arab League and is not as large as the rumored 7,000 men.</p>

<h3>Whether UK-Soviet Trade Negotiations Can Resume Depends on the Sincerity of the Soviet Union; The UK Hopes that the Soviet Union Will First Repay the Overdue Debt</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Sources said that the United Kingdom still hopes that the Soviet Union will take action first to resume UK-Soviet trade negotiations. The Soviet Union's action will be to pay the latter half of the £2.4 million debt owed to the UK. This debt was originally due on August 1. Since Labor MP Zilliacus met Stalin in Sochi on the Black Sea and declared that Stalin had expressed his willingness to sign a trade agreement with the UK and hoped that negotiations could resume soon, political and economic figures in the UK, although questioning Stalin's remarks, felt that the next action should be taken by the Soviet side first. The recent breakdown of UK-Soviet trade negotiations was due to a failure to agree on the terms of the Soviet Union's repayment of its debt to the UK. Therefore, if the Soviet Union can pay the already overdue debt of £1.2 million, it would undoubtedly be the first step towards resuming trade negotiations.</p>

<h3>The UK and US Have Reached an Agreement on the Issue of German Occupation Costs; The Soviet Union Criticizes the UK and US Policies Towards Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] After two days of secret negotiations, the UK and US delegations here have reached a draft agreement to amend the financial terms of the agreement to merge the UK and US zones in Germany. This draft agreement has been sent to London for approval by the British government. The content of the agreement is still strictly confidential, but British officials here said that their position is firm and they will never allow the UK to spend huge amounts of hard currency.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] Moscow Radio commentator Melnikov today criticized the UK and US policies towards Germany, believing that the purpose of this policy is to restore the German war industry. It is said that the announcement earlier this week to dismantle 610 German factories is nothing more than turning German industry into a "tool of UK and US expansion policy."</p>

<h3>The Past and Future of the Ryukyu Islands</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 2) Central News Agency</p>
<h3>This is True "Sentiment"</h3>
<p>According to the "Chuzan Seikan," the types of tribute included: horses, knives, gold, silver, gold and silver powder boxes, agate, ivory, conch shells, sea bass, plam leaf fans, gilt fans, raw kernel, copper tin, raw and cooked ramie cloth, cowhide, frankincense, aloeswood, sandalwood, Chinese sweetgum, yellow ripe incense, sappanwood, ebony, pepper, sulfur, and whetstones. The gifts from the Chinese government in return included gilded silver seals (such as the seal issued in the first year of the Kangxi era, which was engraved with the large characters "Seal of the King of Ryukyu," and a new seal was issued during the Qianlong era, with the same inscription), crowns, gowns, brocades, silk, satins, pottery, porcelain, iron pots, banknotes, seagoing ships, raw ramie cloth, and embroidered shirts. Tassels and boots. Such continuous tributary acts for nearly five hundred years were almost the result of pure sentiment without a trace of coercion. (The Ryukyu entry in the Encyclopedia Britannica also states that the Chinese government never attempted to place Ryukyu under military control from beginning to end.) On the contrary, the Ryukyu king (such as Sho Shin) repeatedly requested to break the rule of one tribute every two years and change it to one tribute per year, "to rely on the favor of China and be wary of other countries' prying eyes." However, the Chinese government (such as Emperor Xianzong of the Ming Dynasty) always wanted to spare the distant people from hardship and granted their request. On one occasion, King Bunei of Chuzan presented several eunuchs to Emperor Chengzu, who ordered the Ministry of Rites to return them, arguing that "They are also human beings. How can we bear to punish them when they are innocent?" The Ministry of Rites said that it was afraid of hindering the hearts of distant people who wanted to submit, and asked that an edict be granted to stop them from presenting eunuchs again. Emperor Chengzu did not listen and ordered their immediate return, arguing that "It is better to show them practical deeds than to talk empty words. If we do not send them back now, they will want to please Me and there will inevitably be successors who come. The world values the creation of life, how can an emperor sever humanity?" During the reign of Emperor Shizu of the Qing Dynasty, "The tribute of horses was exempted as an example." During the reign of Emperor Shengzu, only sulfur, conch shells, and red copper were required to be contributed. The rest "are not native products and are exempted from tribute." At that point, Ryukyu no longer needed to consult with Malacca and Siam to be allowed to purchase tribute goods. (The consultation document is quoted in "The History of Okinawa's Marine Development" by Yasato Nobuhiro, which contains the phrase "It is deeply inconvenient that the tribute goods from your country are scarce.") The sentiment contained therein was probably not contrived. Therefore, when King Sho Nei of Chuzan was captured by Japan in 1609, the following was recorded: "In the fortieth year (of the Wanli era), the Japanese entered Chuzan and repeatedly captured the king (Sho Nei), who did not yield. The Japanese chieftain was surprised and said, 'With such an aura, no wonder he received the title from the Heavenly Dynasty,' and finally released him." Even the last king of Chuzan, Sho Tai, under the threat of the Meiji regime, refused to fill out his "petition," that is, not to pay tribute to China and not to use the Chinese calendar. That would also make him unworthy of admiration. That ancient Japanese chieftain (probably Tokugawa Ieyasu) was probably more "sentimental" than Ashida.</p>
<h3>Ryukyu People Are Absolutely Not Descendants of Japan</h3>
<p>Let us try to examine the widespread nature of the relationship between China and Ryukyu from several angles:</p>
<p>First, in terms of race, Japan's extravagant claim that Shunten was a descendant of the Japanese Emperor is largely unreliable. The Encyclopaedia Britannica states in its Ryukyu article:</p>
<p>"Although the upper class of Ryukyu is remarkably similar to the Japanese, there are significant differences among the lower classes. Ryukyuans are somewhat shorter than the Japanese, but they are proportionally shorter and appear more pleasing to the eye than the Japanese, with higher foreheads, eyes that are not excessively sunken, faces that are not flat, arched eyebrows, better noses, and barely noticeable sternums, along with distinctly bright hair.</p>
<p>High foreheads, deep-set eyes, large noses, and bright hair undoubtedly resemble the Malay people of Southeast Asia. Compared to the narrow foreheads and short legs of the Japanese, there is not even a trace of kinship. Furthermore, according to "Chaoye Huizai" (written by Zhang Zhuo of the Tang Dynasty):</p>
<p>"The people (Ryukyuans) are short and resemble Kunlun people. Nowadays, there are also tall and imposing individuals. Many beautiful people are found in Shuri, Kume, Tomari, and Naha. What I saw at Gumi Mountain were people with dignified visages and well-groomed beards, quite different from ordinary barbarians."</p>
<p>Most of the people in Kume Mura (believed to be the royal capital) were Chinese immigrants. The "dignified visages and well-groomed beards" were clearly the result of the infusion of Chinese blood. As for today, after centuries of infiltration and integration, such individuals are no longer "occasional" but common."</p>
<h3>Language and Writing</h3>
<p>Secondly, language: The forty-seven letters of the Ryukyuan I-ro-ha system (plus "冫", totaling forty-eight letters) are modeled after Japanese writing and fanqie shorthand, all based on the thirty-six letters of the Chinese Qieshu system. However, Ryukyu originally had an ancient script. According to Tao Zongyi of the Yuan Dynasty, "The Ryukyu Kingdom presents tributes to China. The memorials are written on wooden slips, about eight inches high, three-tenths of an inch thick, and five-tenths of an inch wide, decorated with metal clasps, fastened with leather cords, and inscribed horizontally with tadpole-like characters." Clearly, "I-ro-ha" is a product of later Japanese influence. Ryukyu's "memorials to the Chinese Emperor are all written in Chinese," and "correspondence with Chinese people is conducted in model writing." The calligraphy is so refined that it is "no different from that of scholars." ("Whether noble or common, old or young, Ryukyuans will offer paper to Chinese people asking for writing, regardless of their skill. They are especially respectful of letters from envoys, bowing and rubbing their hands, raising them to their foreheads before opening them," see "A Brief Account of the Ryukyu Kingdom"). Ryukyuans Cheng Shunzhe and Cai Wen were both skilled in writing, and Zhen Chang's "Tea Pavilion Record" is particularly rich in emotion and elegance.</p>
<p>Ryukyuan monks (famous ones include Jigai, Fukyo, Somei, and Shokyu) are said to have composed poetry with a Tang Dynasty flavor (here is one of Cheng Shunzhe's "Eight Views of Dongyuan," "Sound of Waves in the Pine Path," to give a glimpse: "Walking to Mount Zulai, all sounds are clear, the Milky Way is halfway across the sky, the early tide rises, listening closely, it's on the tall pines, the leaves welcoming the wind making the sound of water").</p>
<p>The origin of the Ryukyuan language is not easily traceable, but the adoption of Chinese words is very common. For example, Ryukyuans call prostitutes "侏　" ("zhu　"), which is actually the sound of the two characters "傾城" ("qing cheng," meaning "alluring city"). Ryukyuans like to use the word "　" as the most respectful term (not used for Chinese people). They call surnames "Tang names" (the thirty-six surnames bestowed by the Chinese government on Ryukyuans, with Ruan, Mao, Cai, Jin, Liang, Zheng, and Lin being the most common; see the surnames of the Ryukyu envoys in the previous table, which have already been completely Sinicized.)</p>
<p>The teaching materials in Ryukyuan schools are the Sacred Edicts, Chinese classics, and records of tribute to China. According to records: "The school is located east of the Sacred Temple and north of Quanquan Bridge in Irime Village. It has a collection of classics. The king also respectfully published sixteen Sacred Edicts, explaining their meaning and reading them on auspicious days. An official of the rank of Zijing Dafu is in charge. Every third, sixth, and ninth day of the month, he goes to the lecture hall to check on the students' diligence and handles matters relating to tribute to China. The lecturer is chosen from among those in Kume who are well-versed in literature, regardless of whether they are Dafu, interpreters, or scholars. He receives a salary of twelve dan per year. The annotation teacher is chosen from among those who are detailed and clear. He receives a salary of eight shi per year. Three rural schools are also established in Shuri. Children of minor officials and commoners in outer villages use temples as schools and monks as teachers. In villages near Naha, many families also have private tutors. The sound of reading can be heard throughout the night, which is commendable." (Ryukyu Kingdom Chronicles).</p>
<p>This means that the education in Ryukyu over a hundred years ago was almost entirely Sinicized. As for Ryukyuan students who stayed in China, from Wu Ning's adopted son "Rizizi Meirun Bama" and the village official's son "Ren Yeci" studying at the Imperial College to Nan Mu's time, according to my statistics, there were about forty-three people with verifiable names, including female students (such as Gulumu).

<h3>Major Reductions in British Domestic and Overseas Fleets</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Portland, Dorset, 18th] Official confirmation here: The British Home Fleet will be temporarily reduced to one cruiser and four destroyers, with the remaining ships decommissioned. In addition, twelve ships belonging to the Portsmouth Command and several ships from other domestic fleet commands will also be laid up. Overseas fleets will also be significantly reduced. According to authoritative sources, under normal conditions, the personnel of the laid-up ships, although reduced, can be fully mobilized within a few days, but this is not currently possible due to manpower shortages. The Portland's main battle fleet training team, including the battleships HMS "George V," HMS "Anson," and the aircraft carrier HMS "Victory," will not be affected. The Boys' Naval Training School in Gosport, near Portsmouth, will be closed. The Home Fleet's autumn exercises, originally scheduled for October 6, have been canceled due to fuel conservation. The flagship "Duke of York," along with cruisers and destroyers, totaling seventeen ships, were originally scheduled to participate in the exercises.</p>
<p>According to The Times' naval correspondent, after the British fleet reductions, there will be no British combat battleships in any part of the world actively defending the Empire. This role will be filled by four small aircraft carriers and eleven cruisers scattered across five major regions. Before the war, the Home Fleet had five battleships, two battlecruisers, two giant aircraft carriers, six cruisers, twenty-eight destroyers, and five submarines, totaling nineteen ships. Furthermore, the UK's newest 10,000-ton cruiser, HMS "Belligerent," has also been withdrawn from the Pacific Fleet and placed in reserve. The Pacific Fleet will have only two or three cruisers remaining.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Price Increases Finalized and Announced Today; Most Are More Than Double the Original Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Authorities have decided to adjust public utility prices in the city. The new prices will be announced by Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau at a press conference this afternoon. It is understood that the new prices for streetcars, buses, and other services are scheduled to take effect on the 21st. Electricity prices, on the other hand, will be retroactively collected from October 1. The new prices are mostly more than double the original ones. Water prices are not included in this adjustment.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau made a final effort regarding the ad valorem issue of collecting import duties on fuel oil. He visited Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, yesterday morning to inquire whether it was possible to collect duties based on the company's contract price to reduce electricity costs. Director Zhang explained that customs has fixed regulations for collecting duties, generally based on Shanghai wholesale market prices. Customs believes that collecting duties based on the company's contract price would conflict with other duty collection methods, so there are difficulties in principle. After learning of the Customs' explanation, Director Zhao believed that the adjustment of public utility prices could no longer be delayed, otherwise the companies would be unable to sustain themselves. He then decided to invite electricity companies and customs officials to exchange views again this morning before holding a press conference in the afternoon to announce the adjusted new prices. Director Zhao told reporters that if fuel oil import duties are collected based on market prices, the new price of electricity per unit for the Shanghai Power Company will increase by another 360 yuan from the originally planned 2,700 yuan. However, the Public Utilities Bureau hopes to keep the increase as small as possible to reduce the burden on citizens. The city government will also negotiate with the Ministry of Finance on the issue of import duty rates and whether duties can be paid in installments to reduce the company's burden.</p>

<h3>A Groundbreaking Advancement in Document Work: Electric Chinese Typewriter on Public Display</h3>
<p>Gao Zhongqin, the inventor of the Dianhua typewriter, has come to Shanghai from Beijing and will publicly display his electric Chinese typewriter at the office of the National Business Machines Company at 128 Sichuan Road, starting today every morning. Gao will also hold a press conference at 3:00 PM today at the International Hotel on the 14th floor to exhibit the typewriter and report on the invention process and simple operating methods. The machine is 24 inches long and has 5,400 Chinese characters and English letters, arranged according to the radicals of the Kangxi Dictionary, in the style of a telegraph codebook, with four Arabic numerals as a group. The keyboard has a total of 36 keys. After becoming proficient, the typist only needs to focus on the manuscript, and the hands naturally move to the appropriate positions to type quickly. It can type 50 words per minute and can be used for both horizontal and vertical typing. In addition to Chinese typing, it can also be used for telegraph typing. Gao is currently researching and manufacturing a Chinese typesetting machine. The Dianhua typewriter was publicly displayed 26 times from August 28 to September 9 in Nanjing at the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of National Defense, the Central Party Headquarters, and other ministries and engineering conferences. Over 10,000 people visited. Gao told reporters that the enthusiasm during the exhibition in Nanjing was unexpected. Various government agencies are studying how to use the Dianhua typewriter to mechanize document work and expedite and strengthen administrative efficiency. The Ministry of Communications is also planning to use the machine as a basic tool to improve Chinese telegraph communications.</p>
<h3>Research and Development Investment of US$400,000</h3>
<p>Gao also said that he is deeply grateful for the assistance of Mr. Wardson, the general manager of National Business Machines Company, in the development of this typewriter. Mr. Wardson is very concerned about China's industrial construction, and the investment in the research and development of the Dianhua typewriter has reached US$400,000. The Chinese government is very grateful for Mr. Wardson's assistance in China's industrial construction and has awarded him a "People's Livelihood" certificate of merit as a reward. After the Dianhua typewriter was manufactured in the United States, it was circulated for exhibition in various parts of the United States from February 1946 to May 1947, with an audience of over 100,000 people. All agreed that the structure of the machine would bring about a groundbreaking revolution in Chinese typing and the future of China's telecommunications industry because it is quick and convenient to use. Gao was originally the director of the Telecommunications Department of the Central News Agency. In 1940, he went abroad to study and research electric typing. After returning to China, he became a consultant to the Central News Agency and an engineer at National Business Machines Company. The Central News Agency is also studying the use of this typewriter to improve news telecommunications work.</p>
<p>Gao is also scheduled to give individual demonstrations at the Municipal Government, the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications, the International Radio Station, the Bankers' Association, and other agencies within the week.</p>
<h3>Xiong Foxi Lectures on How to Watch Movies: Story, Characters, Structure, and Spirit Are All Major Conditions of Movies</h3>
<p>[Our Report] This newspaper held its 29th Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Minsheng Radio Station. We invited Xiong Foxi, principal of the Municipal Drama Experimental School, to lecture on "How to Watch Movies." Citizens often watch movies as a regular and sophisticated form of entertainment. Movies are called the eighth art. How should they be watched? It is worth studying. First, is the movie's story. The general audience pays attention to interesting stories, pursuing sensory pleasure, but a good story alone is not enough; it also needs to be matched with other techniques.</p>
<h3>Distinguishing Good from Bad</h3>
<p>Second, the movie's characters. The movie must have individual, three-dimensional, and fleshed-out characters. Puppet characters cannot arouse the audience's interest. Third, the movie's structure. Structure is different from story. A story is a complete explanation, but how the plot is arranged, how it begins, develops, turns, and concludes must be echoed throughout, without flaw. Structure is like building a house. Where should the door be opened, where should the window be opened? There must be a plan first. The movie must also have a pre-planned layout to have a complete structure. Fourth, the movie's spirit. After watching a movie, we feel it is very good, or we feel it is very bad. What is the standard for so-called good and bad? It depends on whether it has value, whether the subject matter it depicts is extracted from real life. A good writer, producer, and director will always find a healthy theme to give the audience spiritual enlightenment. An audience member must undergo a spiritual change between entering the movie theater and leaving the movie theater. In other words, when entering the movie theater, the spirit is empty, but after watching the movie, the spirit is full. This is a good film. As for stories that are a mess, what appears on the screen are abstract, puppet-like characters, and the content is to anesthetize the audience. Such a film is unhealthy and leads the audience down a path of depravity. It is a bad movie.</p>
<h3>Several Minor Issues</h3>
<p>The above is a slightly spiritual discussion of the movie's story, characters, and structure. Here are a few minor issues: The actor's acting skills. If the actors do not perform well, a beautiful movie cannot be created. Actors have a bad tendency to focus on "gimmicks." The so-called "gimmicks" are external, contrived, unreasonable, and unhealthy movements to win the audience's laughter, not actions that come from the heart. If there is no inner feeling, only making gestures cannot move the audience. The issue of beautiful images. Movies contain pictorial beauty and architectural beauty. As far as acting is concerned, the actor's face must face the audience, but it also depends on the situation. If the scene is a deep blue sky, a bright moon hanging high, and a pair of lovers whispering sweet words in the window, it would be more beautiful if the two people turned their backs to the audience and the man slowly put his hand on the woman's shoulder than if their faces were facing the audience.</p>
<h3>Building National Art</h3>
<p>The issue of musical beauty. The common requirement for actors is to have clear diction, so that every word can reach the audience's ears. Not only should they be heard clearly, but they should also have musical rhythm. However, it also depends on the situation. For example, in a scene of a crowd roaring in anger, the combination of low and high tones, although not necessarily heard clearly, is like listening to a tragic song. Also, when a person is angry, the blurred and unclear voice can particularly show strength. Finally, talking about the director, in the movie, the director's position is higher than everything else, and his responsibility is the greatest.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to ask everyone to pay attention. Chinese movies have a history of thirty years. Although they have made many achievements, there are still many shortcomings. In addition, recently, American Hollywood movies have flooded our country's market. Although Hollywood has good movies, there are too many unhealthy and bad movies. They use the performance of big thighs and eroticism as a gimmick, leading our audience into unhealthy deviations. This is truly a national worry. We want to build our own national art. We hope that the audience will cherish our country's developing movies and write down as many opinions as possible, publishing them in newspapers and magazines, as a reference for improvement in the Chinese film industry.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Zhuzhai and Xinzhuang's Jurisdiction. Representatives of the City will Meet Today. The Zhuzhai Progress Association Invited Reporters to Visit.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The issue of the jurisdiction of Zhuzhai and Xinzhuang, caused by the provincial and municipal demarcation issue of Shanghai and Jiangsu, will be brought up for discussion at today's demarcation meeting between representatives of the province and city, and the final direct consultation will be held. Yesterday, the Zhuzhai Town Local Construction Promotion Association invited the newly opened boundaries of the city to visit the town.</p>
<h3>Administrative Cannot Be Unified</h3>
<p>Zhuzhai is located west of Shanghai, accessible by the North Zhai Highway, about a 40-minute car ride. There is an elementary school in the town with more than 800 households. During the unrest, there was a "Three Boundaries Official" set up, because the area was located at the boundary of Jiading, Qingpu, and Shanghai City. Every time you cross a bridge or cross a street, the boundaries of the province and city are very different, even between households, there are differences between Shanghai City and Jiading County. Because of this, the administration cannot be unified, security is difficult to maintain, and construction cannot progress. The townspeople are deeply worried about this. Recently, during the provincial and municipal demarcation, Zhuzhai was still divided into two. The Ministry of Interior intends to划蟠龙港北岸划归嘉定县, which caused the people of the whole town to vigorously oppose it, and repeatedly went to the competent authorities to petition, requesting to change Zhang Shengang as the boundary between Shanghai City and Jiading County of Jiangsu Province, and to unify the entire town under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City.</p>
<h3>Suggest a Public Referendum</h3>
<p>The town has convened a people's protection congress due to the demarcation issue, and elected seven representatives including Shanghai Municipal Councilor Hou Junren to argue based on reason, listing 14 reasons. Among them, it is briefly stated that the customs, people's sentiments, culture, economy, and habits of Zhuzhai Town are closely related to Shanghai City. In terms of transportation, it is about 20 li away from Shanghai City. The municipal government has built the North Zhai Highway, which arrives in the morning and noon. It is more than 40 li away from Jiading, and there is no road to access it. It is only known that it is inconvenient to pass orders from Zhuzhai to Jiading by detouring through Shanghai City. The townspeople hope that the Zhuzhai Town issue in this Suhu demarcation meeting can attach importance to public opinion and make a reasonable solution, and can suggest holding a public referendum when necessary to solve the issue of affiliation.</p>
<h3>The Government Agreed to Consider Exempting Grain from Nutrition Tax. A Statement by Petition Representative Qu Zhenhua</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Forty-four representatives from chambers of commerce and grain dealers in various provinces, cities, and counties went to Beijing to petition for the exemption of grain from operating taxes. They petitioned to eight government agencies, including the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the National Political Council, the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The heads of various agencies expressed great sympathy for the situation of the grain industry and agreed to consider it. The representatives have returned to Shanghai one after another. According to Qu Zhenhua, the standing director of the Rice Business Association, the price of grain is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All countries in the world do not levy business tax on the grain industry. At this time when grain prices are soaring, we must not levy business tax to stimulate grain prices. The levy of grain tax forces grain merchants to increase selling prices. The so-called "the wool comes from the sheep." The propertied class is nothing, but the common people really feel unbearable. Fortunately, all government agencies have expressed sympathy for this petition. The Legislative Yuan has agreed to consider the point of excluding the grain industry from the amendment of the Business Tax Law. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance also sincerely agreed to consider it, so the hope for this petition is very high, and there will be specific measures in about two weeks.</p>
<h3>American President Lines Tenders for the Construction of Five Giant Ships</h3>

Fortunately, the fire department drove to the scene and tried their best to rescue the situation. It took about half an hour to extinguish the fire. It is estimated that a water tank and a large number of tableware were destroyed. It is reported that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the electric water tank.</p>
<p>At about 3:50 PM yesterday afternoon, a truck numbered 35113 of the British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill at 670 Yangshupu Road, loaded with 30 pieces of yarn, was driving through the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Tongbei Road when a worker accidentally dropped a cigarette butt on the yarn, causing a fire. The Yangshupu Fire Department drove a pump car to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was extinguished in a short time. As a result, five pieces of yarn were burned, and the rest were flooded by water.</p>
<h3>The Railway Bureau Formulated Measures to Deal with Soldiers Distorting Traffic. Specially Made Half-Price and Free Tickets</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The two railway bureaus have recently formulated "Measures for Preferential Treatment of Soldiers Riding the Railway" in order to strictly prohibit soldiers from riding trains without tickets. The detailed measures are as follows: The railway bureau specially produced two types of tickets for single-trip soldiers, half-price and free, and stipulated train numbers and added preferential soldiers' cars to ride separately with tickets. Soldiers who accept preferential treatment can directly go to the military transportation office at each station and apply for procedures with official letters or business trip certificates. Those who are willing to ride at half price will be issued a type A vehicle pass, and those who ride for free will be issued a free ticket exchange certificate. Then they can exchange tickets with the vehicle pass and the exchange certificate at the ticket office. Those who accept preferential treatment must be neatly dressed in military uniforms and abide by the rules for riding the train. Half-price tickets can be exchanged for tickets on any train number except for numbered cars. Officers above the rank of colonel can exchange for half-price first-class military tickets with their vehicle passes. Officers below the rank of lieutenant colonel can exchange for half-price second-class military tickets with their vehicle passes. Soldiers can exchange for third-class military tickets with their vehicle passes. Military carriages are added to the specified train numbers. If there are first and second class train numbers, a second-class car and a third-class car will be added. Officers who ride for free will sit in the added second-class military carriages, and soldiers will sit in the added third-class cars to avoid mixing. If there is no early train with first and second class, two third-class cars will be added, with officers and soldiers occupying one each to avoid mixing. The number of preferential cars should be stipulated to avoid crowding. When the quota is exceeded, ticket exchange certificates for the next preferential treatment will be issued in order. Single-trip soldiers carrying luggage shall be handled in accordance with the railway regulations. If single-trip soldiers carry goods of a commercial nature in addition to luggage, they shall pay fees in accordance with the railway regulations. Passengers who ride without tickets, ride beyond the station, and ride beyond the class must make up the ticket in accordance with the regulations. Soldiers who carry prohibited items shall be confiscated and handed over to the local military police agency for handling in accordance with the law, and reported to the superior for record. Female employees of military agencies who have complete certificates shall be treated equally, and military dependents are not included in the preferential treatment. In the event of a dispute, the local military transportation office is responsible for handling it and reporting it to the superior for record. These measures have been submitted to the Ministry of Communications by the bureau and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense for approval. The above measures and their train numbers will be announced and implemented within days.</p>

<h3>Visit to the Toupeng Disaster Area. Impressions of the Tanggong Bureau's Soil Retention Work</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 10th] Toupeng Town safely survived the biggest "ghost tide" in mid-July, and the residents congratulated each other and built a structure in the engineering site. On the 13th, 14th, and 15th days of the lunar calendar, they specially performed three days of drama to celebrate the success of the engineering office. Mid-month is the last big tide of this year. On the 18th (October 2nd), Chinese and foreign people went to Haining Baibao to watch the tide, still "the tide of people is as big as the tide of the sea, and the sound of people is louder than the sound of the tide." General Kirk of the United States also took a plane to Qingdao to watch the tide. However, in order to see whether Toupeng can be preserved in the great battle between man and the tide, the reporter specially went to the disaster area for an inspection for a week.</p>
<p>The reporter arrived in Toupeng at noon. The first thing that caught his eye was the many bricks and tiles taken down from the houses, and the broken houses that had been partially demolished and stopped. However, many red and green slogans were newly posted on the walls of those broken houses, praising the achievements of the engineering office and Director Dong. Walking to the river, the reporter met an old man and asked him about</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Collapsed Bank</h3>
<p>He said slowly while looking at the river: "Since the 'Showa Era', the tide has been entering more than ten miles in the past seven or eight years. My home was originally over there." Following the direction he pointed, I saw only a vast river, with wave after wave crashing against the former wave. There were no traces of houses and fields. I asked again: "How many houses have collapsed?"</p>
<p>"There must be no less than four or five hundred. There are more than a dozen bao households alone!"</p>
<p>"Where do they live now?"</p>
<p>"Those who had time to demolish their houses sold the bricks and tiles and went to other places to make a living. Those who didn't have time to demolish their houses only had enough to</p>
<h3>Escape with Their Lives</h3>
<p>Some are still farming in the surrounding villages, and some are living in relatives' homes. Fortunately, no lives have been lost in the tide."</p>
<p>Right across from us, the Zhenhai Pagoda in Haining is thirty miles away across the river, and can be seen in the distance. Under that pagoda, it is crowded with elegant men and women from all over the world watching the tide, but the mood here is so different. It is truly "the same great tide, two different views."</p>
<h3>Soil Retention Engineering Office</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the office, it was decided to build a seawall at the east corner of Toupeng Town first, using a large number of peach stones to protect the bank. The original plan was to build three seawalls, using 10,000 cubic meters of stone and 105 wooden cages. The revetment would use 10,800 cubic meters of stone and 360 wooden cages, requiring a total construction fund of 1,493,787,000 yuan, and 708,876 catties of flour for the workers' wages, totaling 2,468,491,500 yuan, with the local burden of 900 million yuan and the rest allocated by the Tanggong Bureau. As of October 1st, 527.48 cubic meters of rubble and more than 50 wooden dragons have been thrown, fighting hard against the tide for half a month before laying the foundation and ensuring that it does not collapse. However, due to the limitation of funds, materials, and manpower, coupled with the impact of rising prices, the project is limited to East Street. The original plan could not be completed. The estimated price was only 823,000 yuan per unit, but now the wood alone costs 1.25 million yuan, plus the internal stone and the external stone, it costs a total of 3.95 million yuan. However, Toupeng</p>

The pear trees are over ten feet tall, and the elm-leaf plum trees are also over ten feet tall. They are all planted next to the hospital's office. Although the autumn leaves have fallen in the courtyard, the cypress trees remain green, while the other plants have withered. The pear trees that blossomed have long since shed their leaves, but the elm-leaf plums still retain their green leaves, with clusters of snow-white flowers blooming brightly among the few remaining leaves, facing the sun. The elm-leaf plums still have some residual leaves, and the newly opened red flowers are densely clustered on the branches, vividly eye-catching. The vibrant red elm-leaf plum blossoms and the pure white pear blossoms complement each other, filling the courtyard with the colors of spring.</p>
<h3>The Past and Future of Ryukyu</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 3) Central News Agency</p>
<h3>Living Habits</h3>
<p>Regarding living customs, a few examples are listed below:</p>
<p>Throughout history, [the Ryukyuans] have respectfully followed the orthodox calendar. When tribute envoys arrived in Beijing, they would always wait for the bestowal of the seasonal calendar before returning. On the first and sixth days of the New Year, they would pay respects and offer congratulations like the Chinese.</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the fifth month, they would hold dragon boat races (one in Naha, one in Kume, for a total of three dragon boats) and eat zongzi. They would also worship and celebrate the festival with wine, just like the Chinese.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, they would hold a ghost festival to worship ancestors and ancestral spirits. Some would also invite monks to perform the Ullambana ceremony. Flying kites was only done in September.</p>
<p>On the eighth day of the twelfth month, the whole country would make glutinous rice cakes. On the thirtieth and fourth days [of the twelfth month], they would send off the Kitchen God, and on the fifth day of the first month of the following year, they would welcome him back, just like in our country. Many households had shrines for deities, with incense burners placed in green stones. Some say this was for ancestral spirits. Many also worshiped the five characters "Heaven, Earth, Sovereign, Parent, Teacher." In Shuri, there was a "She Huai" (社壞), in Tomigusuku, there was a "Rain Altar" (雨壇), on the hills of Shuri, there was a "Cloud Altar" (雲壇), in Naha, there was a "Thunder God Temple" (雷神廟), and in Kume, there was a "Temple of Literature" (文廟). In the center of the main hall was an image of Confucius, with two shrines on either side containing images of the Four Associate Sages, each holding a scripture. In Naha, there was a "Temple of Guan Yu" (關帝廟) (inside the temple were inscriptions by Wang Yuyang and couplets by Xu Baoguang, saying: "A loyal heart always hangs on the Fusang sun, Righteous spirit passes through the ocean winds of time."), and temples to the Dragon God and the Water Goddess, just like in China (all the above can be found in Zhou Huang's *Ryukyu Kingdom Chronicle*). "The scholar-officials enjoy playing weiqi, and the monasteries often provide weiqi for guests. If they are tired, they are offered pillows, like the Chinese stationery boxes, with three or four layers inside, each person taking one," which reminds one of the refined demeanor of Chinese monks and scholars who "close the flower courtyard with the sound of chess" (Zhang Xueli's *Record of an Envoy to Ryukyu*).</p>
<p>Scholar-officials often drink and make merry. They like to use the "finger-guessing game" to toast, singing in a drawn-out tone and accompanying themselves with the sanshin… In autumn nights, the sound of silk and bamboo instruments fills the air, and many sing Chinese string and wind songs.</p>
<p>(Wang Yi's *Miscellaneous Records of an Envoy to Ryukyu*)</p>
<p>The tea cups are yellow with green floral patterns. The cups have a red and black lid, and a hollow saucer underneath. The cups are quite large, but the tea is only filled to two or three tenths. A small piece of fruit is placed in a spoon inside the cup. This is learning the Chinese method of offering tea. (Xu Baoguang's *Zhongshan Chuanshin Lu*) (The rest will not be recorded).</p>
<p>The living customs of the Ryukyu people, from the broad lower social strata to the scholar-official class, were deeply and universally imbued with a Chinese flavor. As the Reuters reporter who landed with the American forces in Ryukyu on April 10 of the previous year saw, "Everywhere is a nation dominated by Chinese culture" (Reuters, Okinawa dispatch, April 10, 1945). This is by no means accidental, but rather the natural result of the fusion of Chinese and Ryukyuan sentiments over five or six hundred years (at least).</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Japanese "Sentiment"</h3>
<p>Conversely, the relationship with Japan, ever since Tokugawa Hidetada sent troops to forcefully capture King Sho Nei of Zhongshan in 1607, has always been characterized by undisguised overbearingness. This included forcibly making Ryukyu subordinate to Satsuma, interfering with its finances, and establishing the rule that the Ryukyu heir must visit Kagoshima (a Japanese territory northeast of Ryukyu) at the age of fifteen. When the Meiji Emperor ascended the throne (in 1868), the Ryukyu king was forced to acknowledge Japan as his sovereign, to prohibit Ryukyu from paying tribute to China, and to use the Meiji era name. As for the Taiwan Incident of 1874 (the thirteenth year of the Qing Dynasty), which was caused by the accidental killing of Ryukyuan sailors by the Botan tribe of Taiwanese aborigines, Japan used it as an excuse to fabricate a three-article peace treaty, mediated by the British envoy Wade, which vaguely placed Ryukyu under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, treating it the same as any domestic prefecture. Finally, in 1879 (the fifth year of the Guangxu reign), the Japanese showed their true colors, sending several warships to formally annex Ryukyu as Okinawa Prefecture, and forcibly taking the former king (Sho Tai) to Tokyo, appointing a prefectural governor to administer the prefecture. The protests raised by our country have continued for nearly a century, and it is truly time for a response to be obtained!</p>
<h3>The Future of Ryukyu</h3>
<p>Let us temporarily set aside emotions and focus solely on the overall security of the Pacific. Ryukyu, a large archipelago of 473 islands of varying sizes between Kyushu and Taiwan, with an area of 2,386 square kilometers, is Japan's stepping stone for its southward (aggressive) expansion. At the same time, it divides the Pacific Ocean from the Yellow Sea, and some even compare it to the "Dardanelles Strait." The issue of Ryukyu's sovereignty was briefly discussed last October. At that time, some senior American officials believed that "if the Ryukyu Islands were to change sovereignty, they should be handed over to China, or the islands should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations, with China solely responsible for administrative matters, to which the United States would also agree" (see United Press International Washington dispatch, October 9, 1946). The views of another group of Americans are represented by Professor Grosoy. In his book "The Land and People of Asia," when discussing the problems occurring in the Western Pacific, he stated: "It would be sound military strategy to deprive defeated Japan of its foreign territories as an aggressive military state... If this is implemented, Taiwan should be returned (note: Taiwan has already been returned to China) and Ryukyu to China" (chapter in the original book, Pacific Basin).</p>
<p>In short, although the two groups have different focuses, they both agree that Ryukyu should be returned to China. We firmly believe that this is a correct and timely conclusion. Recently, a group of revolutionary patriots in Ryukyu, led by Xi Yoming, launched a movement for Ryukyuans to return to their motherland. In order to consider the deep-rooted emotional ties between China and Ryukyu that have lasted for five or six hundred years, and for the sake of the security of the entire Pacific, and even the security of the entire world, we have reason and determination to respond to this movement!

<h3>The Most Severe Riverbank Collapse</h3>
<p>Houses, including the land, only sell for 1.3 million [currency unit] per jian, so the cost of rescue exceeds the value of the houses being rescued. What's worse, the Nansha people themselves are not up to the task. Director Dong said, "Not only are they unwilling to contribute a single cent of the 900 million [currency unit] in funding, but they also have low morals and lack unity. They would rather see someone else's house collapse, and then their own, than cooperate to carry out riverbank protection work. Therefore, the riverbank collapse is becoming increasingly rampant. We can only rescue the overall situation according to plan. The small collapses in the Western Street caused by wave impact are being handled by the residents themselves, who are provided with materials. Some people are too lazy to help their neighbors. Currently, what we can take comfort in is that in the area east of our project, the high tide has already encroached 150 meters, and its length has exceeded that of Toupeng Town. Toupeng had already collapsed during the ghost tide."</p>
<p>Toupeng was originally the economic center of Nansha, and the locals called it "Little Shanghai." During the most severe riverbank collapse, it was once like a dead city, but now it is as active as before. (Reporter Huang Xingtain)</p>

<h3>Yarn Factories Purchase National Cotton from Production Areas; National Bank Allows Handling of Export Financing; Maximum Export Financing Amount for Each Company Not to Exceed 20 Billion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] President Zhang Jia of the Central Bank summoned representatives of national and private yarn factories on the afternoon of the other day to discuss how to stabilize yarn prices. The meeting ended at about 8 p.m. It is reported that it was generally agreed during the discussion that the main reason for the failure of yarn prices to continue to fall is the increasing cost of cotton. For example, although Lingdou cotton clothes have fallen to 4.5 million yuan per dan in recent days, they are still far beyond the actual cost of cotton farmers. Therefore, it was decided that new state-run and private yarn factories, in conjunction with the Farmers Bank and cotton merchants, should organize joint institutions when purchasing cotton in various production areas, and jointly negotiate cotton prices to maintain the interests of cotton farmers, without raising prices or grabbing dirt, in order to stabilize cotton prices. In addition, each factory felt that it lacked funds to purchase national cotton. After discussion, President Zhang allowed each yarn factory that purchases national cotton to handle export financing. Based on yarn factories with more than 10,000 spindles, about 3 billion yuan of export financing can be handled per 10,000 spindles. However, the maximum amount of export financing for each company shall not exceed 20 billion yuan. Once approved by the Four Joint Offices, it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Spinning and Adjustment Committee to Hold Registration of Cotton Yarn Processing Industry; Cotton Yarn Exceeding Storage Quantity to Be Purchased at Import Price</h3>
<p>[East China News Agency] The Society, ordered to carry out the registration of yarn and cloth in Mu City, has already completed it. It is now known that the association will also hold the cotton yarn processing industry registration? In order to prevent hoarding and speculation, and to clarify the consumption of cotton yarn. Registration will be handled first in Shanghai, and then promoted to other areas, in order to ensure that the allocation of sales is carried out. The Bureau of Mines is now actively deliberating on the "Implementation Plan for Adjusting the Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth" stipulated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and will soon be implemented. In addition, the association restricts the storage of yarn and cloth to the quantity and storage period. The cotton yarn stored in each yarn factory processing factory should be sufficient to supply the factory for three months. Yarn stores are not allowed to store cotton yarn for more than forty-five days. Cloth merchants are not allowed to store cloth exceeding twice the amount of their self-reported monthly sales. If the storage of yarn and cloth exceeds the time limit and quantity, in addition to purchasing at the cost price, and reporting in accordance with this state, will be implemented in accordance with the "Adjustment Plan," it is said.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Panic in This City Entirely Caused by Hoarders</h3>
<p>Responsible person of Shi Shan Company said that according to the responsible person of the China Shi Shan Company, the supply of gasoline in this city, according to the actual situation, is sufficient for the use of all cars in the city. The panic that is currently occurring is entirely caused by the psychological effect of the general car class, and the purchase and hoarding of gasoline by general hoarders. Although the local authorities have strictly controlled the situation with towels, the black market for gasoline cannot be avoided. Hoarders are still secretly raising prices. In order to completely eliminate the black market, the best way is to thoroughly check the inventory. All merchants and citizens with cars must restrict the amount of newly existing gasoline. If the inventory survey is accurate, and then a reasonable distribution is made, it can have a considerable effect. If there are any concealments, a method of rewarding whistleblowers can be adopted to solve the problem. In this way, the supply of gasoline will not cause panic again.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Decides on Artificial Silk Allocation Price</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Trust Bureau held an artificial silk pricing meeting and decided on the list prices for the artificial silk to be distributed by the bureau from the 20th to the 26th of this month. The prices are as follows: Dongyang Dafugui 1A 64.8 million yuan, 2A 63.5 million yuan, 3A 61.56 million yuan, 4A 58.32 million yuan. Tianqiao 1A 64.4 million yuan, 2A 63.12 million yuan, 3A 61.18 million yuan, 4A 57.96 million yuan. Others 1A 64 million yuan, 2A 62.72 million yuan, 3A 60.8 million yuan, 4A 57.6 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Cotton Cloth Prices Fall, Eight Speculative Businesses Close Down</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 19th] The price of Tianjin cotton cloth has gradually fallen from the peak price of 900,000 yuan per piece this week. On the 18th, the market price of Zhongfang Hong Wufu cloth had fallen to 660,000 yuan. Eight yarn and cloth stores here have closed down due to speculative losses. Their managers have also been detained by the competent authorities and will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Commodity Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Commodity prices in Hangzhou generally fell on the 18th. The reason is that Shanghai's implementation of special-grade inspections of goods has curbed speculative traders, resulting in stagnant market transactions. Rice prices have fallen by 30,000 yuan across the board. Shangshu white rice has dropped from 604,000 to 571,000 yuan. The highest price for Dajian, a large commodity traded in the market, is 418,000 yuan, followed by 465,000 yuan. Edible oil has plummeted, with each dan falling back by 130,000 yuan. Peanut oil is 1.8 million yuan, tea oil is 1.7 million yuan, and rapeseed oil is 1.55 million yuan. Silk and yarn fabrics continue to depreciate. Factory silk is 64 million yuan per dan, and Hangzhou warp silk is 48 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan compared to the 17th. Tianqiao 20-count yarn is 23.8 million yuan per piece, and 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is 4.85 million yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Expensive Cigarette Wrapping Paper Threatens Small and Medium-Sized Cigarette Factories; Paper for Each Carton of Cigarettes Has Reached 10 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the highest rate of increase in the price of cigarette raw materials is paper. Although the price of finished cigarettes has also increased along with the rising prices of all goods, the rate of increase is far less than the rapid increase in the price of paper. In terms of the market price of various types of paper in the past week, transparent paper has increased from 6.5 million yuan per ream to 15 million yuan, trademark copperplate paper has increased from 3.5 million yuan to 7.5 million yuan, and the market price of Minsheng paper has reached 40 million yuan per carton. The prices of other packaging papers have also risen sharply. According to people in the cigarette industry, the total cost of cigarette paper circles, trademark paper, transparent paper, steel paper, and other essential items for each carton of cigarettes has reached 10 million yuan, and the price of tobacco leaves is not included. The factory price of ordinary mid-grade cigarettes is about 11 million yuan, so the selling price of finished products is far less than the cost. This is the case for medium-sized cigarettes that already have actual sales. As for small factories, it is even more difficult to increase sales because their brands have not yet become widespread. The soaring prices of various raw materials have caused their costs to increase day by day, and small factories lack large amounts of cash to operate, so they also need to borrow large amounts of funds. Therefore, the recent soaring prices of cigarette raw materials are particularly painful for small and medium-sized cigarette factories.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry Association Requests Increase in Foreign Exchange for Cigarette Paper Circles</h3>
<p>The National Cigarette Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance in order to solve the difficulties in the supply of cigarette paper. The request was for foreign exchange for self-provided cigarette paper circles, steel paper, and to relax the foreign exchange quota for various raw materials. It is now known that the association has received instructions from the Ministry of Finance stating that the government has already promulgated implementation rules for the self-provided foreign exchange portion of each of these raw materials, and they can be followed. As for relaxing the quota, they should directly request the approval of the Rolling Council. At the board meeting convened yesterday, the Cigarette Association stated that the cigarette industry is one of the heavy industries, and its products are daily necessities that are indispensable to people's lives. The amount of tax revenue it pays to the government is the highest among all industries, and the government should not classify it as a luxury or consumable item. Currently, cigarette factories are most in need of paper circles and steel paper, so it is necessary to request the Standing Committee to approve the early delivery of paper circles, etc., which are self-provided foreign exchange in the existing customs warehouse, in order to avoid production interruption and affect tax revenue. As for the relaxation of the foreign exchange quota, the most lacking raw material for cigarettes is paper circles. In the quarterly quota of 780,000 US dollars, the Inner Yin Cigarette Company accounts for 100,000 US dollars, the cigarette industry in various places outside the city accounts for 150,000 US dollars, and the 10+ cigarette factories in Mu City only account for 530,000 US dollars, which is a huge difference from the actual production requirements. Therefore, the expansion of the foreign exchange quota for paper circles is extremely urgent. It was decided to request the authorities to increase the foreign exchange for paper circles to 1 million US dollars. If the authorities find it inconvenient to increase the amount of foreign exchange, they would rather reduce the amount of tobacco leaves to compensate for the amount of paper circles. This is because tobacco leaves can be increased, while paper circles cannot be increased domestically for a while.</p>

<p>Mr. Chen Shuren, an advanced member of the Party and State, followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen in his early years, engaging in revolution and journalism. Later, after completing his studies and returning to China, he assisted the central government, led overseas Chinese, and made many contributions before and after the War of Resistance. Throughout his life, he meticulously studied literature and art, and his words and deeds were consistent. His poetry, calligraphy, and painting have reached the level of three perfections, unique for a time.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also once said that he had been engaged in art for nearly fifty years, and although he was bound by political affairs in the middle, he never neglected it. Moreover, he held a reformist view of art, believing that art is creative and progressive. If it is stale and repetitive, it loses its value. From this, we can see the revolutionary spirit and unique insights of a revolutionary artist.</p>
<p>Furthermore, perhaps some people still advocate that artists should create art for art's sake, and some even regard artistic creation as the manufacture of commodities. However, Mr. Chen has consistently advocated that art should aim to contribute to society, the nation, and the world. He has repeatedly promoted the theory of personal art, believing that all literary and artistic creations must have personality as the backbone, and that writers must first have cultivation in morality and ethics before they can have great gains. This saying is in line with Wen Zhengming's saying that "If one's character is not high, one cannot use ink," and Wang Yuanqi's saying that "Learning to the end is first and foremost valuing literary character." It is an unchanging truth.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Shuren's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Now, reading Mr. Chen's works such as "Red Cotton," "Green Bamboo," "Banana Tree," and "Willow Birds," not only are they full of spring scenery and extraordinary elegance, but they are also ethereal and transcendent, with a unique charm. Figures such as "Donkey Driver" and "Coolie," and landscapes such as "Emei," "Jianmen," and "Lushan," are full of deep and majestic meaning and poetic flavor. Only those who take nature as their teacher can reach this realm. Mr. Chen has always taken praising nature and promoting labor as the keynote of his creations. Whether it is poetry, calligraphy, or painting, the selection of materials and the setting of intentions are based on this keynote. Combined with his integrity and lofty character, and his calm and humble disposition, viewing his person is like seeing a clear sky after rain, and viewing his paintings is like seeing a transcendent world. The painting is like the person, and the person is like the painting. It is the success of personal cultivation and the expression of artistic purity.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's works are not only loved by the people of China for a long time, but also have long been praised in the international art world. Now that Mr. Chen is about to hold an art exhibition in Shanghai, and will soon be preparing to go abroad, the people of Shanghai can feast their eyes, and in the future, China's art and culture will also be promoted overseas through Mr. Chen's trip. I will use a few words to celebrate the future of our national art.</p>
<h3>Biography of Stendhal</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Few writers have been as neglected by their contemporaries as Marie-Henri Beyle, whose pseudonym was Stendhal (1783-1842). His two masterpieces, "The Red and the Black" (Le Rouge et le Noir) and "The Charterhouse of Parma" (La Chartreuse de Parme), were commercially slow to succeed and were often ignored by critics. His famous essay "On Love" was seventy years earlier than Freud (Freud called him a psychological genius), but it sold only seventeen copies.</p>
<p>It was not until forty years after Stendhal's death that he was discovered, cheered by Paul Bourget and the new psychological novelists, and admired by Zola and the self-righteous writers. By this time, there was almost as much written about his literature as there was about Napoleon.</p>
<p>Recently, Matthew Josephson published "Stendhal: A Biography," and C.K. Scott-Moncrieff translated Stendhal's "Armance."</p>
<p>"Armance" is an exquisitely researched retreat. Gide considered it a neglected masterpiece. In addition, Montcrieff also translated many stories adapted by Stendhal based on 16th-century Italian chronicles, which are mostly about familiarity, robbery, crime, and revenge, which are worth reading, but are not representative works of Stendhal. The total name of the legacy book is "The Shorter Novels of Stendhal." Unfortunately, his autobiographical letters and diaries have not yet been translated. Apart from Gide, it can be said that no writer has spoken so frankly about himself.</p>
<p>Josephon's biography contains many new materials. Stendhal is not as famous as Balzac or Zola, so it gives us a fresh feeling.</p>
<p>"The Red and the Black" is a true reflection of the times, and it is also excellent in depicting inner complexity. Both literary schools have accepted Stendhal's legacy: one is writing Binyism, and the other is psychological novels.</p>
<h3>Bird Stories</h3>
<p>— Chang Lan</p>
<p>If you feel lonely during this long night, then put down the book in your hand, extinguish the flickering candlelight, let the moonlight flow into this small house, and I will tell you a story about a bird; although I know that a story cannot dilute your deep melancholy. But other than that, I really have no better way to pass this quiet and restless long night.</p>
<p>The story goes like this:</p>
<p>Many strange birds are said to have their own series of sad encounters, like the cuckoo crying blood in the middle of the night, and the bush warbler chirping "Better to return home." In the silent night, they all sing to their heart's content, as if venting their depression and sorrow through this unrestrained singing. The story of the "Sesame Bird" that I am going to tell here is said to have an even more tragic background, so its cries are even more mournful.</p>
<p>In a remote mountain town, many years ago, a family lived in a mountain valley: a mother-in-law, a daughter of fifteen or sixteen years old, and a son who was not yet one year old. According to the local custom, they would buy a girl to be a child bride for their child, and this child bride must be much older than their child; because on the one hand, they can ask her to take care of the underage child, and on the other hand, they can arbitrarily ask her to do some clumsy farm work. "An eighteen-year-old sister comes to a one-year-old boy" - this proverb is spread from there. Our mother-in-law spent thirty taels of silver, according to the rules of "one-year-old, two rites," to buy a fifteen-year-old girl, and that was their family.</p>
<p>The newly arrived child bride was such a clever and shy little girl! She could embroider various vibrant flowers, she could decorate the poor home with wildflowers to make it look like a secluded and peaceful fairyland; she could mend the tattered clothes so neatly and fittingly; in terms of farming skills, she could handle that millstone-sized sieve. This was a task that even men found daunting, but she could make it spin smoothly.</p>
<p>In contrast, her little sister-in-law seemed so lazy and clumsy.</p>
<p>Precisely because the new daughter-in-law was smart, she aroused the jealousy of her little sister-in-law, who often stirred up trouble in front of her mother, making up many lies. The mother-in-law gradually changed from fondness to jealousy and disliked her.</p>
<p>--Don't open your eyes wide and stare at me. What? Do you think it's strange that such a smart and capable little girl lost her mother's favor? In fact, if you lived in that mountain for a year and a half, you wouldn't find it strange. Because it's still like this even now. The facts tell you that the mother-in-law there dislikes the daughter-in-law as commonly as we should eat every day; not to mention that her own daughter uses many lies to slander her every day?</p>
<p>But the young child bride silently endured all these difficulties and ridicule, because she seemed to know that this was an arrangement of fate, an irresistible force formed by nature. She could only try to win a glimmer of sympathy with more diligence and hard work. She became more diligent and hardworking day by day. But jealousy, abuse, and ridicule, these demons stretched out their claws even more sinisterly towards her, forcing her to the end of her life's journey...</p>
<p>She didn't seem to feel the threat of these demons, because in the mountain city, these were too many, too ordinary, and too commonplace. Her only hope was that her little husband would grow up as fast as bamboo shoots, and she could get some warmth and affection from him.</p>
<p>"A thousand-year-old road becomes a river by treading, and a daughter-in-law for many years becomes a mother-in-law," this is the ancient proverb popular in the mountains, giving her enlightenment. She endured hardship and swallowed her tears, patiently waiting for the spring to bloom. But the days seemed to pass even more slowly than in the past. Day by day, the demons' claws gradually stretched out beside her, and some scars of destruction were branded on her body. She looked at her future, vague and elusive, and even living in this world, she felt so bleak and empty. Every time she thought of this, she cried with boundless sorrow.</p>
<p>Day, night, dusk, dawn, on the lightless path of life, she groped in disappointment.</p>
<p>One year, it was time to sow the sesame seeds. In the evening, the mother-in-law gave her and her little sister-in-law each a liter, and asked them to sow it in the fields the next morning.</p>
<p>The jealous and vicious little sister-in-law got up in the middle of the night, put on her clothes, and secretly put the liter of sesame seeds allocated to her sister-in-law in the pot, lighting a red-hot fire; the next morning, they both sowed the liter of sesame seeds allocated to each of them into the fields.</p>
<p>Days passed, and in the sesame field, new goose-yellow buds sprouted on one side, while the other side of the field remained yellow-orange mud.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law must be a jinx descended from heaven, otherwise? How come she and I sowed the same seeds, but they don't sprout?" the little sister-in-law chattered in front of the mother-in-law every day.</p>
<p>The poor child bride still ran to the field every day to wait patiently, waiting for the sesame sprouts in the ground to grow out of the soil. But the sesame had the same fate as its mistress, subjected to violent destruction, and never had the hope of being born.</p>
<p>The mother-in-law said to others, "If the daughter-in-law is not a jinx descended from heaven, she must be a broom star reincarnated."</p>
<p>Insults, beatings. These were the most familiar things to her.</p>
<p>Finally, on a stormy and rainy night, the child bride sneaked out of the house alone and walked into the depths of the forest.</p>
<p>At this time, she had no scruples, she thanked God for arranging such a final destination for her painful life. She didn't bother with anyone else, everyone in the world hated her, otherwise why didn't her sesame seeds sprout like her little sister-in-law's? Thinking of this, she was not sad about the withering of her youthful flower, she just felt that she had no nostalgia for life, she embraced death happily and painfully. Slowly, her back disappeared into the dark forest.</p>
<p>The next morning, many curious people walked into the forest and gathered around a tree, watching a young girl, hanging straight on the branches. The rain from last night dripped down from her disheveled hair. Kind old women shed tears of sympathy sadly.</p>
<p>It is said that after a person dies, their soul can reveal many unknowable secrets and conspiracies of their lifetime. Our child bride could already know the innocence of her death and the unfortunate encounters of her lifetime. Therefore, her soul unwillingly turned into a bird. Whenever it was the season for sowing sesame seeds, she would fly to the mountains every night and cry mournfully. As for the reason for crying, was it to vent the accumulated resentment in her heart, or to warn some miserable people who shared the same background as her? Or was it to make a heavy accusation against her mother-in-law and little sister-in-law? No one could know.</p>
<p>My story should end here, but similar tragic encounters like the Sesame Bird still thrive like malignant creeping plants in that mountain valley full of feudal ideas.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"You think I have that much power?" This was a feint by Yin Qun.</p>
<p>"At least they all trust you!" Mr. Mai's attitude was very firm.</p>
<p>"Then, why do you feel so interested in them?" Like boxing, after a feint, Yao Qun gave it a Black Tiger Pouncing on the Heart, a punch in the chest. In other words, to make it "show its cards."</p>
<p>"Miss Ji, although we met by chance, we may become lifelong friends in the blink of an eye." It changed to a low and deep tone, like a hypnotist casting a spell; "Let's not talk nonsense in front of real people, believe it or not is up to you..." It paused for a moment, focusing all its attention on Yao Qun's face: "I can be said to be a person without nationality, but I have a 'religion;' this religion is 'sympathy for the weak!'... You can believe me, and we can continue to cooperate, if you don't believe me, we can only part ways!... If I talk any further, I'll still only say these two sentences." It sealed off the most important secret!</p>
<p>Believe it? Just based on its mouthful of crooked and rotten teeth, Yao Qun didn't dare to believe it. However, from these two sentences, especially the four words "sympathy for the weak," Yin Qun roughly figured out its background. Although she wasn't 100% sure, it was pretty close.</p>
<p>"What if you slip up?" Yao Qun took advantage of the situation to probe it again.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, not to mention these few rascals inside the pass, even the headquarters outside the pass wouldn't dare to touch me; my connections... go way back!"</p>
<p>"Okay!" Yao Qun prepared to take the risk of temporarily using it, but couldn't think of a smooth way to express that although she was cooperating with it, she wouldn't let it catch any handle.</p>
<p>"Don't be indecisive, Miss. I'm going to the 'Action Headquarters' first, and around twelve o'clock, let's go to a restaurant on Nanma Road; bring your nephew with you. Maybe this trip will bring good news...</p>
<p>Yao Qun stopped telling the story of Tianjin here, wondering what she was thinking, and smiled at Little Tiger. With this smile, I finally understood the wonder of her disguise; it turned out that her white teeth were not moved or damaged at all, only some chemical colors were added, yellow, blue, and black, applied to the surface of the teeth. At first glance, it looked like a mouthful of rotten teeth, and with the effect of light, it also looked uneven in length and incomplete.</p>
<p>As for the eyes, eyebrows, nose, and other parts, it seemed that if the positions were moved, only the two emerald eyes had been cut and dyed. Once the eyebrows were changed, the face naturally changed greatly; in addition, she used that what-is-it hair root grass, which made the skin a little swollen, and added some small pustules like fire sores, so it seemed as if the positions had been moved. But after I stared at her for a long time, I felt that her charming outline still existed.</p>
<p>At this time, we were all gathered in Changping again, and she was extremely happy. When she talked about the story of this trip to Tianjin, she forgot her disguise, and her demeanor and actions were still so innocent and lively. I felt that she was not as ugly as she looked at first glance.</p>
<p>"It's also because I'm too nervous," Yin Qun continued: "Thinking that Tiger wouldn't let that transgender person, Mai Shaofu, get away with it, I wanted to find a way to keep them from meeting temporarily. At first, I thought Tiger would come to the hotel, and I could just tell him the situation clearly, let him find another place to live, and communicate secretly. Who knew that after waiting until almost eleven o'clock, there was no sign of him, so I had to hurry up and think of a way before the guy came back?... Cormorant Raft (Guilin Scenery) Chen Shuren</p>

<p>Looking forward to the future, the progress of science is the most admirable and joyful thing; but the rapid progress of science today makes it difficult to predict; there are indeed many beautiful and moving, amazing achievements that do not have to wait until tomorrow to be seen, and they are growing in the scientific field today.</p>
<p>The application of atomic energy is undoubtedly the most brilliant part of tomorrow's science, and electronics has also made equally great achievements today, especially in the field of ultra-short waves. It has made it possible for us to communicate with the moon, and has also brought the most wonderful and useful tool—the electron microscope, which has given the greatest help to all scientific and industrial research, allowing mankind to see the tiny world that was previously invisible. The 30,000-fold magnification of the electron microscope makes optical instruments that magnify 1,000 times and ultraviolet microscopes that magnify 3,000 times seem insignificant. Here, scientists are beginning to truly and practically observe the work of material molecules. It has also opened up new horizons for bacteriology and metallography, becoming the most effective tool in today's science.</p>
<p>Great success will also be the fight between mankind and disease. Advanced sulfa-drugs, penicillin, and synthetic anti-malarials have saved many diseases from famous doctors. But there are still many deadly diseases, and the work of scientists still cannot be relaxed in the slightest.</p>
<p>Recently, among the 2,000 possible combinations of sulfa-drugs, in addition to the five that have already been applied, the rest are in the process of being imitated, manufactured, and tested; the other four types of penicillin, penicillin FGK and X, are being extracted from 50,000 types of green mold for application. The rapid discovery and manufacture of many drugs will keep pharmacologists, biologists, and physicians busy for many years from now.</p>
<p>The petroleum industry is the most important industry for mankind, but in the past, we still only had two simple methods—heating and steaming. However, industrial scientists have long pointed out that different molecular organizations have a great impact on the quality of gasoline. Whether used in cars or airplanes, gasoline containing more octane has the best volatility and can avoid the most annoying knocking phenomenon in internal combustion engines (this is because gasoline ignition and spontaneous ignition and explosion coexist, so they collide with each other, generating a pressure of more than 1,000 pounds per square inch, which endangers the engine. High-quality gasoline can withstand high compression without spontaneous combustion.)</p>
<p>Therefore, many new procedures such as hydrogenation, catalytic cracking, allotropic transformation, and multi-base procedures have been added today to obtain the appropriate molecular organization and improve the engine's economy and safety.</p>
<p>What is most unclear and analyzed by the general public is the use of plastics and synthetic rubber as our useful materials. Although it also has many shortcomings and cannot be used to make a completely "glass" car or machine, it is more suitable than other materials for some uses. Recently, the ignition system inside cars has adopted this type of raw material, which is very suitable. In terms of temperature resistance, there has also been improvement, and it can now withstand various temperatures from 75 degrees to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. A material called "fiber glass" is a good material for solving the insulation problem of generators and motors.</p>
<p>Modern science has given the metallurgical industry abundant vitality, making this science, which has been studied since ancient times, always moving, because our requirements for all metal materials are never satisfied. We need its load-bearing capacity to increase day by day, hoping that it can control the vast atomic energy. The importance of the responsibility is not difficult to imagine; ultra-high-speed flight requires not only high strength and high performance, but also lightness. Everything requires further metallurgical research.</p>
<p>X-ray photography makes the observation method in metallurgy a specialized field of knowledge, and electron microscopes allow scientists to observe the organization of molecules. These are the driving forces that enable the quality of today's thousands of alloys and alloy steels to bear heavy responsibilities.</p>
<p>Huge wings, the latest machinery, such as electronic bombers and electron microscopes, are not all made of "human materials"?</p>
<p>Yes, the beautiful and moving world is not only in the future, but also today. Look at the brilliant flowers in the scientific field, which are blooming under the diligent irrigation of scientists!</p>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xuerun</p>
<p>"Energy" has a very close relationship with everything we come into contact with in our daily lives. For example, household appliances such as electric lights and electric stoves use a kind of "electrical energy" to convert it into "light" or "heat" energy, making it very convenient for us to enjoy; of course, others are just the same, continuously using "energy," and applying "energy." Therefore, knowledge of "energy" can enable people to learn from daily life experiences and achieve it through learning; but it is necessary to have basic knowledge.</p>
<p>The most obvious and most perceptible "energy" is a kind of "mechanical energy." --If you push an object hard with your hand, then this object, if it is stationary, will start to move in the direction you push it, and the object will only stop after a considerable distance. --If we talk about the law of "mechanical energy"; because according to Newton's second law of motion, when an object is in a stationary state, if its mass is m, after being impacted, it has the ability to move at a speed (F-=m.v), and if an object has a speed (V), it has a kind of "kinetic energy" (K.E.=1/2mv2); once it has "kinetic energy," if it is not affected by other external forces, the object will always retain this "energy," in other words, the object will always maintain its original speed and move continuously, but in fact, it is affected by air resistance and other forces, such as friction, as a result, the object stops. But the object has already moved (S=1/2mv2.1/F) to your destination.</p>
<p>The throat can make sounds because the vocal cords vibrate violently, and at this time, the surrounding air already has a kind of "wave energy," which spreads outward, and then touches the eardrum; so our daily ears rely on "energy" in the air to transmit sounds.</p>
<p>Strike a match. --Because of the mutual friction between substances, a considerable amount of "heat" is generated, and as a result, a very bright flame is produced. You must know that "heat" is a kind of "energy," and when this kind of "heat energy" is converted into another kind of "light wave energy," the match head starts to "burn." But what is "light wave energy"? What is "burning"?... The reason why we "see" a burning torch is that the "light wave energy" can be transmitted to, and at the same time, through our eyes, it stimulates the retina and causes a sense of light. The embers of the match, of course, are carbon and other impurities, however, a branch is burned into carbon and other substances, which belongs to the change of "chemical energy."</p>
<p>From the above, it seems that there are many kinds of "energy," but there are many kinds of "energy," there are also "potential energy," "electrical energy," and "atomic energy." However, there is a question, where does "energy" come from, and why has it been used for tens of thousands of years and it is still not used up?</p>
<p>The sun's "radiation energy" is projected onto the earth's surface, and various objects absorb it, and at the same time, it is transformed into various kinds of "energy." During the process of radiation shining on the earth, some parts are scattered by gas and become diffuse light, and because of the unevenness of diffuse reflection, the heating of various parts of the ground is also uneven, so there is a difference in pressure in the atmosphere, and thus the formation of wind. Usually, using wind to replace human power, such as sailboats and windmills, is applying the "energy" of the sun. Often, radiation shines on the water surface of rivers and seas, evaporating water vapor, and then encountering cold air currents in the sky, and thus forming dew, snow, frost, and hail falling to the ground, because the cold air currents have a range, so a certain area has a "potential energy" of high water level, and when the water flows down to the surrounding lower water levels, it becomes "kinetic energy."</p>

<h3>Artificial Snow</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>When you are bored, readers can make artificial snow at home, which is both interesting and rich in scientific meaning. You may wish to try it. Utensils: a box of safety matches, a silver coin, a small amount of iodine, and a flash. Environment: a tightly closed place with cold air, preferably with black walls as a background, so that the small snowflakes can be easily displayed.</p>
<p>Steps: Dip a drop of wine on the match head. Rub it on the silver coin, and a small amount of silver will stick to the match head. Strike the match, and when it burns, the smoke will contain extremely fine silver iodide crystals.</p>
<p>In cold air (below ten degrees Fahrenheit), blow on it, and the temperature of the exhaled water vapor will drop sharply. The water vapor is between the silver iodide particles, and under the illumination of the flash, bright snowflakes will appear. It is difficult to reach a temperature below ten degrees Fahrenheit in ordinary room temperature. You can try one of the following: In a household food freezer;</p>
<p>Use a large empty bottle! Surround it with a large wooden barrel filled with dry ice to lower its temperature (be careful not to touch the dry ice directly with your hands); On cold winter nights, in a tightly closed car or similar situation. The snow made in this way is quite cold to watch indoors. Therefore, you can use this "kinetic energy" (also called water power) to generate electricity, and "constant energy" can be converted into "mechanical energy" to supply factories and transportation needs.</p>
<p>When plants receive the projected radiation, photosynthesis occurs, which can absorb carbon dioxide in the air and decompose it into "air," and at the same time, carbon is the main component of the body, so the "heat" and "light" obtained when burning wood are nothing but the reappearance of "solar energy," so the growth of plants, from the perspective of "energy," is the function of transforming "solar energy" into "chemical energy" and storing it. Animals live on plants and the air they produce as nutritional raw materials, so "solar energy" is also transferred into animal bodies; as mentioned in the previous paragraphs, "pushing objects with your hand," "striking a match," "vibrating vocal cords," and "listening to sounds" are all people using the "solar energy" they have obtained. Thinking back to ancient times, the remains of animals and plants in the strata have become today's various minerals; therefore, the "energy" of minerals is nothing more than the "energy" accumulated when the ancient times projected on the ground. It can be seen that all the phenomena on the ground mostly come from the sun's emission, and all "energy" can be classified into "energy," but it is often changing "her" face, and it will never be reduced. Of course, if the sun's "energy" is exhausted, the earth will no longer receive "solar energy," and at that time, humans will no longer be able to survive on the earth. Therefore, we can make full use of the "energy" possessed by all substances on the ground, for example: During World War II, Germany discovered that using the vapor of liquid fuel and gasoline as a propellant resulted in the emergence of the terrifying V-2 rocket. The United States adopted the principle of transforming "atomic energy" into many other "energies" and produced the atomic bomb that shook the world. The power of "energy" is indeed worthy of the name, so can we, living in this scientific age of the twentieth century, still ignorantly ignore this "energy"?</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Will Lead to Human Extinction</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>In the September issue of the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists," Dr. Hermann J. Muller of Indiana University warned that even if atomic bombs don't destroy millions of people, humanity will slowly and unconsciously be destroyed by atomic energy. Professor Muller, the winner of last year's Nobel Prize in Biology, believes, based on experiments, that the atomic energy used in peacetime will cause mutations in the genetic material within cells, making reproduction impossible and endangering the extinction of the human race.</p>
<p>The reproductive cells of humans, animals, and plants all contain tiny particles (genes). When these genes are altered or destroyed, "mutations" occur. These mutations can be so severe that they render the next generation infertile. Usually, these mutations lie dormant within the cells, combining with mutated genes from the opposite sex during reproduction, eventually revealing their effects. Dr. Muller won the prize because he irradiated the sex organs of fruit flies with "X-rays," resulting in the birth of many deformed offspring. This proves that "X-rays" can destroy fertility. However, fruit flies have short lifespans, so the adverse effects are quickly apparent. In humans, it may take hundreds or thousands of years to manifest. But Dr. Muller believes that by then, every descendant will suffer from the ancient damage, either dying or losing the ability to reproduce, leading to the complete destruction of humanity.</p>
<p>He often said that doctors can easily shield the sex organs from "X-rays" to prevent the destruction of fertility, but the danger of atomic energy far exceeds that of X-rays. It also contains "Gamma rays." When an atomic bomb explodes, it directly kills hundreds of thousands of people and also plants the seeds of this "gene mutation" poison in the survivors. This is passed down generation after generation, eventually destroying all of humanity. The same is true for peacetime use of atomic energy. Therefore, Dr. Muller loudly appeals that once atomic energy can be directly and extensively used, how to eliminate and prevent these accompanying radioactive rays is a problem that urgently needs to be solved today. In the past, simply using lead screens to shield human reproductive organs from X-rays is clearly not enough now. What's even more terrifying is that this harm is too slow and difficult to detect, and its adverse effects only appear years later. As a result, people generally neglect this terrible enemy of humanity. They must realize that this small impact will combine and expand repeatedly, generation after generation, until the "mutation" completely destroys the human reproductive system. Only then to take preventive measures will be too late.</p>
<h3>Is Mutation a Chemical Change? (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hao Tianhe</p>
<p>After a genetic analysis of the lethal genes produced in the first CIB experiment, it was discovered that some of these lethal genes were caused by the rearrangement of chromosomes. This was confirmed by Dr. Slizynski through cytological examination. Chromosomal rearrangement caused by mustard gas stimulation has become a matter of course. In December 1941, another special experiment was conducted. Their designed method focused on the translocation of chromosome positions. For example, two colored chromosomes exchange a part with each other. However, automatic exchange is rare under normal circumstances, but mustard gas undoubtedly has the power to cause chromosomal rearrangement. Among the 816 cell nuclei tested, seven had translocations. A report on the results of this experiment was submitted to the War Department in March 1943. However, all similar work could not be published at that time because mustard gas was a kind of poison gas and related to the war. Later, many more experiments were conducted on chromosomal translocation and other forms of rearrangement. All of this research used fruit flies as further material, which is worth noting. In 1943, Dr. Koller applied the pollen mother cells of Tradescantia Virginica to cytological research and completely confirmed that mustard gas can cause chromosome breakage and rearrangement.</p>
<p>The effects of mustard gas and X-rays on heredity are quite similar, which is obvious. However, it is still possible to find certain differences between these two effects. These differences may be very interesting because comparing chemical and physical mutagens may offer more hope of understanding the problem of mutation. The first difference was found in the phenomenon of translocation. The rate of occurrence of lethal genes caused by X-rays and the rate of occurrence of translocations caused by X-rays both increased directly with the intensity of the rays. The translocation rate is equivalent to the 3/2th power of the light intensity. As a result, under a certain intensity of X-rays (calculated in Roentgen units), a numerical relationship was established between the number of lethal genes and translocations. At 3,000 Roentgen units of X-rays, nearly 9 percent of sex-linked lethal genes and nearly 6 percent of translocations can be produced. These translocations are between the second and third chromosomes of fruit flies. After treatment with mustard gas, this quantitative relationship significantly shifted towards sex-linked lethal genes. In the mustard gas experiment, it was originally expected that there would be 6 percent translocations, but now there are only 0.5 percent translocations occurring between the second and third chromosomes. The sex-linked lethal genes produced in this experiment were still 9 percent. In subsequent experiments, it was found that the percentage of translocations also decreased in the same proportion. This observation seems to indicate that mustard gas is not as effective at breaking chromosomes as X-rays, but to draw this conclusion, careful consideration is needed. It must be remembered that the methods we use cannot yet explore the exact situation of chromosome breakage. Now we can only know the proportion of rearrangements. We can speculate that after that kind of chemical treatment, it may hinder the steps of chromosome fragment rearrangement. Therefore, since there is a certain number of fragments, the number after the completion of rearrangement will be less than that after X-ray machine treatment. Special experiments are still needed to prove this point before a conclusion can be drawn. Social Services</p>
<h3>Two Explanations on Military Service Issues Answered by the Third Section of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>(Question) A person's original residence is in place A, and their registered residence is in place B. Both places have registered households. For military service, should they be conscripted from their original residence or their registered residence? (Answer) According to the provisions of the Military Service Law, a man serves one military service, in principle, in his original residence. If he wishes to fulfill his military service obligations in his registered residence, he should report in advance to the local Baojia in his current residence, and report to the county (city) government, which will notify the county (city) government of his original residence, and inform the Baojia of his original residence to avoid duplication. Otherwise, the township of the original residence should provide a certificate that the person has been dealt with by the conscription of the original residence, and transfer it to the Bao of the current residence for verification and cancellation. (Question) If a family settlement fee for soldiers has already been paid in the original residence, can the family settlement fee and consolation money for soldiers in the registered residence be waived? (Answer) The city currently levies two types of preferential treatment fees: one is paid by conscripted soldiers, and the other is paid by households without soldiers enlisting. The preferential treatment fee payable by conscripted soldiers does not need to be paid if the conscription is not handled by the city. The second type does not need to be paid if it is an individual. As for the consolation money for enlisting soldiers currently being raised by the District Bao, it is based on the clear order of the Municipal Government Military Service Association to organize the District Bao to send off volunteer soldiers to the camp. The objects of raising consolation money vary depending on the environment of each District Bao, sometimes targeting soldiers and sometimes targeting affluent households. (See the "Clarification of Doubts about Encouraging Volunteer Soldiers' Consolation Money" published in the 13th and 16th days of this month's column.)</p>

<h3>Answered by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</h3>
<p>[Summary] This column answers questions once every Saturday. Letters are limited to questions related to telecommunications business. Please indicate "Telecommunications Business" on your letter. The text should be concise and to the point. Please write your real name and address in your letter. We may reply directly by letter if necessary.</p>
<p>(Shi Guoguang from Tongren Road asks) How many types of private telegrams are there? (Answer) Private telegrams are divided into ordinary = P, urgent = D, social = SLT, news = Z, urgent news = DZ, and express telegram = L. Regardless of whether it is a private or organizational group, all telegrams sent that do not meet the regulations of military telegrams, official telegrams, and other types of private telegrams shall be treated as ordinary telegrams. The Bureau receives mostly ordinary telegrams, so the calculation of the prices of various telegrams is based on the price of ordinary telegrams. If the sender wants to send it in advance, he can send an urgent telegram. The fee is doubled. A "急" (urgent) or "D" can be written on the telegram, and an additional word is calculated. Social telegrams refer to greetings, thanks, etc. News telegrams must be approved by the Ministry of Communications and issued with a news license before they can be sent. Express telegrams are for special business purposes, and only telecommunications bureaus that have opened express telegram services can receive and send them. (Li Jingshan from Hongkou asks) I have opened a grocery store and now want to install a commercial telephone. Can I apply? What are the procedures and prices? Commercial telephones are difficult to install due to the provisions of Article 1 of the promulgated amended municipal telephone restriction measures.</p>
<p>Lost and Found Jin Jieguodong and others went to school from home a few days ago and picked up a gold ring near the new garbage tree. They did not see anyone looking for it at the time and could not return it. Now, they have specially enclosed the ring and sent it to the museum, praying for disclosure, so that the loser can claim it. Otherwise, they will listen to your newspaper's donation to any charitable cause to promote public welfare. Respectfully to the Social Services Column of Shen Bao, Shao Guodong and Zhang Rongzu, sixth-grade students of Huzhou Shanghai Primary School, October 14th</p>
