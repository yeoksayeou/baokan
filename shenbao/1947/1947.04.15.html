<h3>主席昨午安返首都　接見白崇禧聽取臺灣事件報告　離滬前續垂詢經濟狀況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣主席昨日中午十二時四十五分赴江灣機塲，偕軍務局長俞濟時及侍從人員等乘美杜魯門總統贈予主席之C54四引擎巨型機〇〇一號返京。該機由美國來滬，停留江灣機塲已歷數月，銀色機身上漆青天白日大國旗。主席乘坐此機，昨為第一次。昨日主席返京，蔣夫人陳參謀總長等並未隨行。夫人於十二時十五分會先往中訓團，候主席到訓後，同往機塲歡送。同時，吳市長·宣司令·俞副局長叔平·空軍上海蕊地司令王衛民·張彼德等多人亦往送行。</p>
<p>昨日上午九時，主席會在官邸接見聯總中國分署署長艾格頓將軍，談話片刻後，復召見參政員緒輔成，冷禦秋，兩氏就江浙兩省目前絲業危機，報告甚詳，主席面允設法挽救。旋市黨部書記長謝仁釗亦晋謁主席報告本市黨務推展情況，並建議加強國民經濟運動。九時三十分奚玉書應召往謁，主席即垂詢本市物價及一般經濟狀況，由奚氏提供意見，主張物價應予全面管制。正常合法之證券交易，政府應予協助，不宜干涉，主席表示贊同。嗣又分別接見宋子文，朱世明，楊虎等。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕主席十四日下午一時五十五分返抵京，京市長沈怡曾往機塲迎接。主席機降落大校塲，事先無人知悉，故往迎者除沈怡。商震等外，僅記者而已，主席下機後，即返官邸休息。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕主席於下午五時半在官邸接見白崇禧，聽取白氏對台灣事件之報吿。據有關方面稱，台事之處置，不日當可揭曉。</p>
<h3>軍樂修揚聲中　青年軍受檢閱　主席致訓勉冠成使命</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年軍二〇二師官兵及復員靑年軍，昨晨在本市中正公園受蔣主席檢閱。典禮極隆重莊嚴，該師官兵於昨晨八時即已在公園內集合，整隊完畢，其中上海官兵於昨晚抵公園露宿，其他來自蘇州·無錫·太倉·常州·常熟·崑山者則先後於晨曦時趕到。</p>
<p>昨日被邀參加盛典之來賓有吳國楨，吳紹澍，宜鐵五口，謝仁釗，傅正謨等。十時二十五分陳參謀總長偕宣司令到達。</p>
<p>十時四十五分，主席戎裝蒞臨，吳市長等均列隊相迎。主席下車後，向歡迎官長答禮，旋即上閱兵台，向靑年軍左右注視，並聽取該師師長羅澤閱報吿到塲官長七一三名，士兵六八一七名，復員人數三六七名及武器數字，副步下閱兵台，登吉普車，陳總長陪坐於後，車由靑年軍官長一名駕駛，侍衛官楊鳳藻，及另一靑年軍長官亦隨坐。主席立車上，在軍樂聲中沿隊伍巡行檢閱，宣司令及其他長官分乘四輛吉普在後隨駛。主席車過列隊，向靑年軍頻頻回禮，士兵分隊高呼口號：「統一意志」。「團結精神」，「實行三民主義」，「掃除革命障碍」，「中華民國萬歲」，「蔣主席萬歲萬萬歲」！</p>
<p>檢閱畢，主席復上閱兵台向全體官兵訓話，時陳總長立主席左邊，來賓排立右首。</p>
<p>主席對靑年軍訓詞，首說明國民革命之目的，在實行國父之三民主義，建立富强康樂的新中國，革命軍人應在三民主義領導之下，確保國家民族之自由平等一，然後方不愧為國父之信徒，為黃帝之子孫，主席繼訓勉在營之靑年軍，人人應嚴守紀律，服從命令，自動，自治，自立，自强，以期不愧為健全之軍人，對已退伍之青年軍幹部，則指示其應本犧牲精神，堅守崗位，埋頭苦幹，實行生義，建設新的國家社會，然後方不愧為自由獨立之國民。</p>
<p>主席於十一時二十分離中正公園後，又赴中央訓練幽上海分團視察並向警官班全體學員官員致訓。</p>
<h3>陳總長訓話</h3>
<p>主席行後由陳總長繼續向全體官兵訓話，略謂：「日本投降後，中央為求和平統一，建立富强康樂之國家，對共黨不惜一再容認讓步，期能達到此項目的，但中央愈忍　，共黨愈張橫，不但拒絕和談，且進而不承認憲法及中央政府，近幾月來，又發動全面軍事攻勢，政府因此不得不予以反擊。又因共黨對人民之唯一方法為欺騙，凡曾被共軍佔領之各地人民，莫不對共軍疾首痛恨，故我們要帮助民衆組織起來，挑選革命同志，担任組織民衆之工作，使人民不再懼怕共匪。</p>
<p>各位是革命的幹部，主席並已將重大之使命，交給我們。</p>
<p>今天我們的責任太重了，我們要將此責任担負起來，（一）消滅土匪，（二）加强生產，解決人民生活，（三）不要做革命的對象，最後請注意，在日敵未投降前，我們決不能到此公園裏來，現在我們在主席領導下，已將日軍打倒，不平等條約取消，故將此公園更名為中正公園，今天我們能聚集在這裏，是値得驕傲的，但革命猶未成功，希望在我們的手裏，能完成國民革命的任務，到那時，再來此聚集，當更為愉快了」。</p>
<h3>雷震張君勱晉京　共同綱領即簽字　府委名單日內同時公布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕共同施日兩黨人士晋謁主席作最後一次政綱領日內即可簽字，並將與三黨府委名單同時公布。主席返京後，民社黨張君勵，蔣勻田，靑年黨左舜生曁雷震亦於十四日晚抵京。雷氏即晚赴吳鐵城寫，向政府人士張羣等報吿兩黨之最後決定、並即討論國民黨府委之人選等問題。十五日謁主席報吿，民。靑兩黨人士亦將謁主席。又民。靑兩黨參加國府委會人選，業經確定，與前載名單相符。政務委員民社黨僅定蔣勻田一人，靑年黨亦僅定左舜生，李璜二人。目前改組政府問題，僅待十五談話後，即可全部解決。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕左舜生談，參加政院將次府委會一步，因尙有待商外。至參加地方政權事，乃基於靑年黨黨員人數較多之省市予以參加，並未指定某一省。靑年黨僅提出數十人，不及參加十二省四市之政權事，現尙未確定。又靑年黨人士劉泗英，陳啓天等即晚在左氏室內會談甚久。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國民黨為決定十二名府委人選，將於明後兩日中舉行中常會討諭確定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據悉，民盟代表正在京與政府方面磋商，要求參加下屆國大代表之競選。政府之意見為國大代表之競選，源自憲法，憲法則來自國大，民盟如欲參加競選，應先承認國大及憲法。</p>

<h3>就召集對德和會問題　王外長嚴正聲明　要求嚴格執行波茨坦協定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕王外長世杰，十四日就對德和會問題，發表如下聲明：「對德和會之如何召集？由何國召集？以及何國可以參加？凡此問題均應由五國外長全體會議決定。該會議中之任何一部份會員，均無決定此問題之特權，此種決定倘非經由外長全體會議產生者，則就外長會議組織條例而言，將為職權行為，與設立外長會議之波茨坦協定相違反，予已數次將中國政府之此種立場，通知現在莫斯科集會之四外長：予采取此種步驟，并非要求彼等予我以任何法律外之讓步，予之步驟，只在要求嚴格執行波茨坦協定。法·英·美三外長於其致予之復文中，均接受予之見解，并聲明將堅持其主張，蘇聯外長則尚未采取相同之見解。予意如果外長會議組織條文之意義發生爭論，則應受尊重之意見，自應為多數之意見，而不應該是少數意見。對德和約為世界和平問題中最重大問題之一，中國政府不僅認為中國必須負擔召集對德和會之一份責任，中國政府并且認為此一和會之組織必須晝量擴大，使一切參加抗德國家均有出席和會之權，并使彼等之一般意見可得到較去年巴黎和會時更高之重視。中國至今尚未接受四起草國外長之提議，提供關於德國和約之意見，在對德和會召集問題未適當解決之前，中國政府將保留其未來一切行動之自由。」</p>
<h3>日對賠償問題　各方態度不一　官方靜候盟軍總部處置</h3>

<h3>丹取銷在華特權　條約批準本在京互換</h3>

<h3>蘇北民間印象記（三）　破碎的公路和綿長的海岸綫</h3>
<p>— 本報記者章繩治</p>
<p>通如海的公路綫　，這是蘇北國軍補給的命脈，這次記者團在蘇北的活動，亦全靠這幾條公路綫，給了我們許多的便利。</p>
<p>我們坐在十輪大卡車上，度過了我們整個訪問節目的一半辰光，幾乎把混身的骨節，顛簸得鬆脫下來。蘇北的平原上，儘多是稀鬆的沙土層，所以汽車在公路上行進的時候，好像到了蒙古的沙漠地帶一般，一陣一陣的風沙，從車後捲了起來，不但吞沒了路旁的樹木草舍，更吞沒了坐在車上的旅行者。當汽車還沒有走上十里遠的時候，每一個乘客臉上，多已「面目全非」，頭髪眉毛全蒙上了一層黃黃的塵土，彼此看到這副怪模樣，都不禁要笑出來。</p>
<p>一位司令部的陳課長陪着我們一起吃灰，他還慶幸着天氣肯帮忙，我們還能在飛沙走石之中，東跑西跑，不然的話，公路上將是一片泥漿，車子不能動彈了。</p>
<p>聽說當局為了顧慮到公路不適宜雨季活動，影響軍事不淺，計劃把狼山旁邊的一座小小的山頭，隧開來作為鋪路之用，不過計劃太龐大了，人力財力一時都辦不到。現在過渡辦法，祗好有勞老百姓把拆剩下來的斷垣殘壁上的破碎磚頭，再利用來拋堆在公路上代替石子路面，免得在下雨的時節，整個的車輪會全部陷入泥淵中。</p>
<p>這樣的路面，不但苦了乘客，而且亦害苦了車子，如果一部車子在上海行駛，假定有五年的壽命，那末在蘇北公路上祗消一年的時間就可全部送了終。亦因為路面太不平的緣故，我們常常可以聽到有些從東台裝棉花包到南通的車頂上，不時發生「黃魚」被摔下來而跌死的慘案。</p>
<p>我曾經和一位修路的鄉人談起，他認為這種修路工作，感覺到莫名其妙。他說：「新四軍來了，呌我們毀壞公路，等到國軍來了，又呌我立刻修復」。最後他笑了一笑說：「這一小段路，是我親手毀壞的，但亦是我親手修復的，而且時間相隔，僅僅是幾個小時的光景，原來前者是夜間的事，而後者乃是白天的事」。他說完了，很天真的大笑起來。</p>
<p>蘇北除了這幾條破碎的公路外，還天賦的有一條綿長的海岸綫　。說得透澈一些，國軍保住了公路綫，而共軍卻控制了瀕海的地帶。在軍事上說：蘇北清勦工作唯一的阻礙，就是國軍在瀕海區內還不能做到確保治安。過去省經有組織水上警察大隊的計劃，但是到現在為止，人事和都成問題，僅僅聽到樓梯響，不見人下來。同時蘇北的海岸，又有與眾不同的特點，因為沙灘淤積，大的海輪不能靠近海岸綫　，非得另行造船，不足以談防治。所以省府的計劃，無形中成了紙上談兵。而共軍卻又用了燒殺的恐怖政策，和改革土地的取巧政策，控制了沿海的漁船和塵民，更利用錯綜複雜的港汶河道，居然造成了「現代的梁山泊」。於是生活在蘇北的瀕海區中的居民，從此談不上安居樂業。過去廣大　墾區的農村經濟，更迫得瀕於破產。</p>
<p>這裏還有一個小小的故事，我們可以從此中看出瀕海區內共軍活動的情形，和兵力的多寡來。原來在蘇北，有一種特產白蝦，當共軍盤踞的時候，因為都給搜括去了，在南通一帶的市價就要高到五六千元一斤。但是等到共軍流竄到別處去的時候，白蝦就會即刻猛跌下來。所以當我們能够吃到千餘元一斤白蝦的時候，一定可以體味到這時期的共軍，又竄擾到別處去了，或者是兵力減少了。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>朝鮮局勢顯露陽光</h3>
<p>韓國革命領袖李承晚氏來華訪問之際，從各方面傳來了有關朝鮮局勢發展的報道。中國人民與三韓人民情同手足，所以我們對於朝鮮的局勢寄予深切的關注。我們感覺到欣慰的是從這些來自各處的報道中，已可以看見一個局勢可能發展的輪廓，至少對於自日本投降以迄目前在朝鮮發展的局勢，能够具有一種澄清的作用。在密集的陰霾裏，已經露出了一些陽光。我們歡迎陽光的出現。</p>
<p>最近關於朝鮮局勢報道之可得而言者：（一）韓國革命領袖李承晚氏於一昨謁見　蔣主席時，據報載消息，　主席當即表示對於韓國爭取獨立，極為同情，并稱：中韓兩國向為兄弟之邦，當互助合作中國決定最大努力，協助韓國成立政府；（二）現在莫斯科進行的外長會議中，美國務卿馬歇爾元帥最近曾致函蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，對於蘇聯在朝鮮的舉措有所指責，要求蘇聯根據一九四五年莫斯科三强外長會議所作關於朝鮮部份的協議，迅予重開在朝鮮之蘇美聯合委員會，以扶植朝鮮獨立政府之成立，并請於今夏定一日期來檢討聯合委員會的成就和對於朝鮮的政策。馬歇爾并在他的函尾聲明如果對於這些問題得不到蘇聯的協議時，美國政府預備在朝鮮南部采取必要步驟來實現莫斯科一九四五年三强外長會議所成立於朝鮮局勢的協議；撥用美金二億元以促進南韓的復興，此項撥款最後也許可能增加至五億或六億美元。</p>
<p>中韓唇齒相依，中國的人民無時不期望朝鮮的獨立統一能够早日實現；中國政府對於朝鮮的獨立統一，亦能循人民的公意予以熱誠的支持。開羅會議的當時，對日作戰的四强就決定了對朝鮮所取的基本政策。扶植獨立統一朝鮮的出現和支持開羅協議的精神，可以說是我國政府對朝鮮的基本政策。此次李承晚氏來華，我　主席又重申了我們對於朝鮮的政策；就是對於韓國爭取獨立，極為同情；中韓兩國向為兄弟之邦，當互助合作，中國決定最大努力，協助韓國成立政府。中國政府對於朝鮮所抱政策的明朗，於此可見。由於目前的種種跡象，朝鮮的人為障碍雖一時或未能消除，但朝鮮臨時政府之能在最近期內誕生，或在理想之中。縱使它的權力或不能達到朝鮮全境，臨時政府的得能誕生，無疑地，必將大有裨益於朝鮮局勢的展開。我們衷誠希望此一政府的誕生必在不遠的將來。</p>
<p>正因為我們對於朝鮮獨立期望之殷，我們希望朝鮮的人民能够衷誠合作來成立他們的政權，鞏固他們的政權，以確保他們民族的獨立自主。據新自朝鮮視察歸來者帶來的消息，謂朝鮮的政團彷彿雨後春笋，為數達二百以上。此在一方面固足以表示朝鮮人民對於政治的覺醒，為一種可喜的現象；一方面也表示着合作情緒的低落，致有如許政團的出現。團結纔有力量；因此，我們希望三韓人民能够掮棄成見，加緊合作。我們感到欣慰的是當李承晚氏覲見　主席的時候，據報載消息，李氏雖表示渠與另一領袖金九合作甚密，韓國人民均盼渠等二人同能出任領袖；可知金李之間已能趨於合作，我們希望這種合作精神能够更發揚光大起來，使整個三韓人民能够凝成一個固體，發揮出他們此後在亞洲歷史上所負的使命。</p>

<h3>外長會議進入決定階段　對奧和約可望草成　克拉克自維也納再赴蘇京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十四日廣播：四外長今日開會時，馬歇爾決與莫洛托夫攤牌。馬歇爾將要求蘇方在原則上同意簽訂永久性之四强協定，保證德國不再武裝化。馬　認為四强協定之細則，雖可隨時討論，但蘇聯必須於此時表明對於此事贊同或異議之態度。</p>
<p>〔合眾社莫斯科十三日電〕四國外長會議初步舌戰結束後，已自昨夜起開始進入決定性之一週，以期對於德國之將來及對奧和約各項問題，判定其能否獲致重要之決議。各外長對於閉塞會議進展之對德和約所爭持之各點，今已放棄加以解決之希望，但英美二國外長現仍希望能在本週內，商獲折衷辦法，俾在會議結束前，可以草擬對奧和約。英美法三國代表團之觀感皆以為蘇聯倘在本週內能對奧約有所讓步，則可望在十日內草擬完成，倘不獲打　僵局。則或將於週六休會。各外長現將於週六加速進行此項工作。倘對解決德國之詳細方案不能獲致協議，則將進而討論美國所舉阻止德國侵略之四國四十年協定一項建議，及分配德國煤斤與對奧和約等問題。</p>
<p>美國對於四强協定一事，雖於星期一或能提出討論，但并不料其能產生任何結果，蓋英法二國對此雖表擁護而附有保留條件，蘇聯則表反對，且亦不致改變其立場故也。西方國方今惟寄其希望於對奧和約，俾在離開莫斯科時不致一無重大成就可言，惟此事之重大障碍，乃在蘇聯對奧境蘇軍佔領區內德國一百萬美元之財產要求，蓋美國所提確定其所有之方式之建議，蘇聯迄未表示同意，英美法三國之意，乃欲確定蘇聯不應要求納粹在奧境內所强佔之財產，但至今雙方無讓步之傾向。惟公正之觀察家則謂：蘇聯亦與其他國家相同，亟盼奧地利之和平，蓋此可使蘇聯停止供應佔領奧地利之用費，并可撤退為維持對奧供應路綫而駐在匈羅二國之蘇聯軍隊云。</p>
<p>〔合眾社莫斯科十三日電〕聞克拉克將軍將於本週內自維也納再來蘇京，協助馬歇爾國務卿進行會務。按克拉克乃因對奧和約似有無限期拖延之勢，故於上週回返維也納，今克拉克將遄返莫斯科，希望能在會議結束前討論對奧和約。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十三日電〕某權威人士今日稱：莫斯科外長會議幕後談判結果，已使西方三國對德國煤斤分配予法國之辦法，成立協議，外長會議的主要障礙之一因而解除。協定中假定薩爾區在經濟上與法國合併，法國因而獲得其大部份煤斤。煤斤之交付視生產之多寡具有伸縮性，但擔保法國可在任何時期獲得一定數量。美國在英法兩國間擔任調人地位，因法外長皮杜爾不贊成德國經濟統一，除非擔保法國可獲得充分煤斤。英外相貝文初曾反對接受約束，供給法國，經美國務卿馬歇爾斡旋，遂成協議。</p>
<h3>馬史兩氏迄未會晤　引起各方種種猜測</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十三日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾與蘇聯總理史達林迄未會晤，今夜此間街談巷議，漸滋疑懼。英法外長已先後進克里姆林宮，但馬氏留居莫斯科已歷三十五日之久，旣未被邀，且據目前所知，亦未求見。一部份蘇聯人士對於馬史迄未會晤之故發生種種疑問，或謂：「事態豈不佳乎」？「兩氏交惡乎」？「馬歇爾將逕行返國而未被邀或不求見史達林乎」？惟一般意見咸認為馬氏在離蘇前終將與史達林會晤，如無邀帖，亦將求見，屆時史氏亦可樂於接見。但圈內人士（借用蘇聯作家習語）則謂史達林身經大小各事，即因善於等候，以待時機對己有利。然馬氏亦係等待時機之能手，史達林此次或將錯過時機。杜魯門總統援助希臘土耳其之舉已使外長會議蒙上陰影。累月以來，外國政治家震撼蘇聯方面之舉動，久無如斯之烈者，此殆即史達林對馬歇爾不發請柬之內幕原因。另一派人士相信克里姆林宮正觀望美國輿論對「杜魯門主義」有何反響。事實上，美國方面對於杜魯門主義之批評，此間報紙與電台無不加以刋登或廣播。今日各報并揭載華萊士在英國演詞，華氏此次遊歷，是否來蘇一行亦已成為蘇聯人士間一常發之問題。</p>
<h3>美國態度堅定　蘇聯當知戒懼</h3>
<p>泰廷斯論美國外交行動</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十三日電〕民主黨參議員泰廷斯頃發表廣播學說稱，美國最近采取之外交行動，可得而言者，有下列各項：（一）對蘇聯采取積極行動之政策；（二）反對蘇聯勢力膨脹；（三）反對希土兩國國內之共產主義；（四）杜魯門總統援助希土兩國之計劃，已使蘇聯之態度稍趨緩和，美國態度之堅定，必能使蘇聯有所戒懼。上星期內，蘇聯代表在莫斯科四國外長會議及聯合國安理會均表讓步，此事大可注意云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯擬與羅國　締結同盟條約</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十三日電〕據英政府接獲消息，蘇聯在撤退其在羅馬尼亞之駐軍前，將提議與羅國締結同盟條約，聞羅國商務代表團上月訪問莫斯科時，曾與蘇方討論此一問題。</p>
<h3>蘇印決互派大使</h3>
<p>〔塔斯社莫斯科十三日電〕四月初，由於印度駐華大使梅濃與蘇聯駐華大使彼得羅夫交換照會之結果，業已議定：蘇聯政府與印度政府，決定互派外交使節，并設置大使館。</p>
<h3>聯合國特別會議　本月廿八日舉行　以謀解決巴勒斯坦問題</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十三日電〕聯合國機構秘書長賴依本日宣佈，聯合國會員國正同意參加聯合國大會特別會議討論巴勒斯坦題者，已有二十九國，故余已向全體會員國發出請柬，決定於本月廿八日舉行此項特別會議云。聯合國大會特別會議將歷時多久，目下殆無一人能逆料，英國希望限制計劃列入本年九月間聯合國大會之議事日程，但若干國家之代表團則或希望澈底討論此一問題。預料特別委員會之構成及其權限，將為最難解決之一項問題。英國希望其本身能參加此一委員會，但阿猶雙方則應除外。阿拉伯國家對此迄未表示任何意見，甚至於召開聯合國大會特別會議之原則，亦未表示意見，但猶太方面則殆將高潮推派代表列席聯合國大會，陳述意見。</p>
<h3>美國人民贊成　國際貿易憲章</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十三日電〕國務院宣布，政府近在六個大城，非正式徵求人民對於國際貿易機構憲章草案之意見，贊成者與反對者成十三對一之比。被徵詢之人，對保障國際經濟合作之具體措施，感覺極大興趣。</p>

<h3>裴柏不願出任　美第三黨領袖　主張保持兩大政黨</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十三日電〕民主黨參議員裴柏本日自米亞美發電通知本社，拒絕前副總統華萊士之邀請，不願出任第三黨領袖。裴柏并保證在民主黨維持自由作風下，均將永為民主黨員。按華萊士刻正在倫敦發表演說，指杜魯門總統之外交新政策為「殘忍之帝國主義」裴柏來電有謂：「余曾對所有自由份子堅決聲明，凡擬組織第三黨之任何企圖將鑄成大錯。民主黨如不願貫澈其為人民服務之任務，固不待萊士裴柏之發起第三黨運動，而人民本員均將發動此項運動。余反對美國有三大政黨之存在，贊成僅有兩大政黨。余將在民主黨內繼續奮鬥，不遺餘力，務使民主黨為美國之真正自由政黨」。仝時，杜魯門返鄉省親之後，由坎塞斯城搭飛機飛返華府，渠在行前對華萊士國外之演說及國內電話工潮均拒絕發表意見。民主黨若干參議員本日主張請杜魯門開除華萊士之黨籍，并發表聲明，否認華氏外交政策宣言。現兩黨若干要員均要求總統對華萊士提出答覆，向世界各國發表聲明，華氏所言不能代表美國政府。據若干第一流政治觀察家之意見，認為杜魯門不致允許華萊士之肆言無忌，預料白宮即將發表聲明云。</p>

<p>〔合眾社倫敦十三日電〕美國前副總統華萊士本日於故總統羅斯福之逝世二週紀念日，在英國廣播公司發表廣播演說稱：英國現較美國有更多之「新政主義者」，并謂「美國之廣大力量與財富不用於提高足為美國國外市場之若干國家之生活水準，而用於戰略及軍事方面。吾人如不以槍砲供給此等國家，而助以機器工具，則吾人可阻止美國經濟之不景氣，吾人之國際貿易亦可突飛猛進，而其經濟繁榮之程度足使共產主義不能在西方立足」。渠稱：蘇聯確係擴展主義者，一如昔日之英國與今日美國之太平洋及其他各地。但余意若干擁有原子炸彈，且未受如蘇聯所遭受之戰爭荼毒之國家，應負起試行新政以保衛和平之使命，此項新政行之於近代世界，可造成世界之繁榮，而不再從事於落伍之國際凌欺弱國手段。余反對以消除赤色威骨為藉口，而企圖統治世界及剝削世界之美國人，但擁護其他深信美國之任務在於貢獻新技術之美國人，增進世界之生產，消費，貿易及世界各地人民之享受。英國之安全并不端賴於聯係東方及西方國家，英國僅能在「天下一家」之下而趨於繁榮。所有政治家對天下一家徒作空談，而所有科學家及眼光遠大人士認為唯有天下一家庶可避免世界之毀滅。英國必須明白世界有采取新政之必要，蓋英國之「舊政」，已宣告失敗云。</p>
<p>英國報紙　不加評論</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕華萊士廣播演說主張世界實行「新政」，今日英國各報皆用大號標題揭載，但極少發表評論。保守黨每日郵報稱，華萊士君為一忠實而具有善意之人。彼雖望見光明景象，但其所欲采取之途徑則殊糢糊。我人認為華氏目標不免錯誤，彼之教訓應在華盛頓或莫斯科發表。</p>

<p>〔合眾社阿根廷十四日電〕新任阿根廷駐蘇聯大使甘東尼博士決意在抵任履新之際，不僅代表阿根廷政府而已，其主要任務在於「介紹阿根廷人民對於蘇聯人民之感想」。甘東尼行前對記者談論渠之使命稱：渠希望能促使蘇阿關係趨於現實與繁榮。蘇聯係對於阿國五年計劃發生最密切關係之國家之一，蓋潘隆總統五年計劃之完成，有賴於美蘇之技術及義大利之人力。甘東尼就蘇阿商業關係發表意見稱：「自吾人彼此建立關係以來，蘇聯即允許吾人之一切物資要求。蘇聯并派遣第一流技術人員代表來至吾國，且在吾人亟需白報紙之時裝來大批白報紙」甘氏不信阿根廷境內共產黨之地位將影響蘇阿關係，對謠傳阿根廷將取締共黨一事表示極大懷疑。按蘇阿自一九一七年斷絕關係以來，至今已達三十年，去年六月四日潘隆總統就職伊始，蘇聯商務代表團即抵達阿根廷，蘇阿兩國即於同年六月六日重建外交關係。甘東尼大使乃阿根廷代表在三十年中進入蘇聯之第一人，此次隨行者計有技術人員及各方面之專家多人，阿政府各部均派有代表一人隨行，約計五十人之多云。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）拒絕廷讓</p>
<p>王崇先問</p>
<p>（一）鄙人在三四年前，將住宅所有餘屋出租給甲，乙二三房客居住，目前鄙人人口增加，不敷應用，故向甲，乙提出「收回住屋」之要求，詎料甲，乙等竟以「目下覓屋不易，且須先付給巨額之小費」爲理由，拒絕遷讓，本市「房屋租賃管理委員會」專事調解房屋糾紛，不知福依何種手續進行請求？</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答：〕徵收「小費」與法有違，如用「外間租賃房屋須先給付「小費」爲詞祖絕遷出，不能成爲理由，但滬市房荒嚴車，迄未解除，對於遷讓房屋，自應酌定相當</p>
<p>日期。又房屋租賃管理委員會於去歲經市參議會決議撤消</p>
<p>（二）惡意勒索</p>
<p>李知甘問　鄙人有自業之里弄單間住屋一幢，於五年前租出。茲因該承租人，另在滬東區配得洋房一宅，巳於本年二月間，遷往居住。故敝屋已空關至今，事實上該承租人對於該屋，顯無繼續租賃之需要。且依照租的，雙方均得於三個月前，通知對方終止租的。幷規定不得轉項別人，鄙人當即去函聲明收回租屋，但該承租人竟函復要求頂費黃金若干兩，據稱乃係依據社會風氣使然，吾則寗願繳納房租，任令空關，爲此懇乞貴處指示，俾資遵循。</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕照來函所述如係事實，可照租約規定經正式通知後仍不遷讓者可提出證據訴請法院裁判。</p>

<h3>抑平本市食糧價格　社局決先拋售紅秈　規定經售米業行號必須嚴切具結</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海糧食總倉庫已奉令撥交市府大量白粳·紅秈·及二號西貢拋售，以抑平本市米價。拋售價較議價低三四千元。社會局現決定首先拋售者為紅秈，白粳則猶待一切手續齊備後，再行拋售。</p>
<p>召負責人　商討價格</p>
<p>該局糧食科特於前昨兩日，分別召集米號業及南北兩市場負責人，商討拋售價格手續等細則問題。出席約錫潮·印福祥·胡文安·胡威鋼等。由吉科長主持會議。決定：（一）紅秈拋售價每市石十二萬另五百元。（二）拋售數量隨時決定。（三）押袋金每只改為一萬二千元。（四）門市零售價格每市石十三萬二千元。（五）以凈重一百五十六手折合市石，不連袋皮。蔴袋每隻以二斤四兩計算。（六）市場價格包括送到車運下力佣金，每市石十二萬五千元。（七）繳款總額改為每包先繳十六萬三千元，以一石二斗五升計算。</p>
<p>具結聲明　決不營私</p>
<p>社會局并為防止米行及米號從中作弊起見，特仿照食油交易規則，規定經售米行及米號，必須具結。米行於具切結時，應註明行名，地址，負責人姓名。聲明領售米糧完全分配本市各實銷米號，并負代各米號向倉庫提貨送達之責，決不營私及超越規定價格。米號於具切結時，則應註明號名·地址·負責人姓名·數量。聲明完全供給門市另售，決不　雜及超越規定價格，并在門市顯著處標明售價，如有違反，願受嚴厲處分。</p>
<p>據吉科長稱：社會局現視到貨多寡，決定拋售與否，以一萬石作標準。如到貨六千石則拋售四千石，如到八千石則拋售二千石。昨日南北兩市場到貨超過一萬石，故社會局未有拋出云。</p>
<h3>成交不多　統債平疲</h3>
<p>公債昨以游資趨向股市，大戶實隆潤德有所了結，統內晨開一五七〇〇元，自一六〇〇〇元高價，回低至一四〇〇〇元而後穩定，成交不到五百萬元，結果較上週六計甲乙戊各降七八百元，統丙下挫一千元。</p>
<h3>港匯價俏　刺激外股</h3>
<p>外股昨以港市匯價再俏，一般擁資者再來力吸，各熱股若怡紗英聯等一度呈有價無市，供過於求之象。怡紗上午曾突起猛烈之漲風，自四一一〇〇元起，爭買不怠，達四三五〇〇元高峰，始獲大量獲利出籠，急切回落而見回。午後經若干業中人爭售下，　續見低至四一〇〇〇元內，結果較上週六計航業再升一成，會德興鋼業各漲半成，餘均微升。</p>
<h3>行莊認購債券</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日新債券募銷情形，各商業行莊包括上海綱業，鑒業，國華，永大，福利莊，安裕莊等，共經募短期庫券美金三四〇一〇元。上海信託公司經募短期庫券美金七千元。中國銀行經募短期庫券美金三三〇〇〇元，美金公債美金一〇六〇〇元。此外，中信局交通銀行各經募短期庫券數百元不等。</p>
<h3>米糧收市略疲</h3>
<p>昨日南北市共到米糧一萬二千石左右，因產區續昂，粳米早市續挺二三千元，秈米亦加一二千元，白元陰元偃師市二三千元。午時因當局關照不得超越週六市面，是以收市略淡，而南粳來貨尚多，波動尚少。</p>
<p>麺粉步升千元，洋粉則續加一二千元，麩皮亦升二千元。豆餅消胃甚爽，先漲後平，盤漲一二千元。</p>
<p>黃豆來貨大減，供不應求，冉冉高翔，步砌二三千元。菉豆南洋揀高動辦，再加二三千元，赤豆華南猛力收吸，繼續飛騰四五千元。</p>
<p>紅糧依然定局，苞米仍然平庸，駕豆乏交，生仁未開，芝蔴挺牢，黑蔴香港動辦，猛烈上漲六七千元。</p>
<h3>蔣主席重視　絲蠶收購計劃</h3>
<p>冷禦秋褚　僧昨特往晉謁</p>
<p>江浙二省旅滬　紳令通·褚輔成，因鑒於蠶汎將屆，而本年度絲繭收購計劃至今尚未確定，對於農村經濟及爭取外匯二項關係甚大，特秉蔣主席在滬之便，於昨晨聯袂赴東平路謁見主席，當由主席親自接見。二氏除陳述二閱月來主管　蠶絲機關及有關機關，迭次會商本年絲蠶收購辦法之內容及經過外，以時機迫促，關係重大，不容再事遷延，特請求政府方面對於蠶農及絲廠保本辦法，迅予確定，以免農民徬徨而裕外匯收入。主席對二氏意見，極為重視，當表示俟返京後，即促農經二部從速提出行政院會議商討決定。</p>

<p>春秋	禹陵風景綫  魯莽　　山陰道上的景色，自古應接不暇。時代變還，人事滄桑，自然界的美觀却是永恒的，她從不遜色。入年大戰以後，所有的鄉村城市，多多少少都有滄桑之感，便是那此名園別堅，也十九賸了斷壁頹垣，然而自然界的景色，却絲毫夫動。「山險道上」是文人對於紹興風景的全面代名詞，並非一定指蘭亭一隅，「流觴曲水，茂林修竹」的淸麗塲面，也處處可見。面紹興人每到春天尤其喜歡到稽山一帶踏靑，那裏樣的山明水秀，且有會稽山脈的最高峯足資　登，高瞻遠矚，以擴胸襟；尤其是有安定人民生活，使我們成為一個有高度文化的民族的大功臣的陵墓在那裏；又有足以啓發民族意識的南未帝王的陵實在那　，紹興人更把那僩地方作為民族的聖地，猶如歐洲人之於耶鲁撤冷。　　何况行程是那麼近，風景又那麽好，春天為什麽不當當去走走呢？在少年時代我也便這樣地走慣了，所以長火後雖經堂旅居在外面，每年總得去走一趟；也所以八九年不回家，對於稽山鏡水眞是夢魂縈繞。去年春天為了旅途不便，曾經在本刊有過牢騷，今年當然不能錯　時期。　　一樣，和小時候的情景，坐着書舫出發，「款乃一聲山水綠」，一幅天然的圖書，立刻展開在眼前，春山如黛，春水似汕。又有兩岸平舖的景色，那是一大片一大片金色的菜花，銀色的菜花和歷亂紛靡的粉紅色的桃花。　　我們對着最高的香爐峯進發，有時經過弓形的石橋，有時穿過初長浮萍的小河，那蒼翠的爐峯，便忽左忽右的迎着我們。　　終於，紅牆一角，出現在遠處的叢林中。呵，民族聖地「大禹陵」快到了，於是溫軟的遊程中添了興奮。轉過兩個　，一座橋，進了大池口，便是「禺王殿前」。雖然過了二月，却因淸明前後，遊春踏青的人仍然很多，殿前的臨時飯館，臨時茶坊，生意興隆，我們光進殿拜謁了巍巍乎大或的禹王塑像，然後遊覽殿內各處及砭石亭，等地，細細地摩挲了一番碑石：再像小時候一樣，在殿角的玩具攤上買了一些竹製的玩具，如螻龍鬥虎等，都合有本位文化的敎育意義。　　現在我們循大路走向三里以南的「南鎭」，地勢一步步的高起來，夾道野花，當頭麗日，又正對着「爐峯」，完全是山景的趣味了，兩邊山上的杜鵑花，紅得可憐，和那些掃墓的婦女們的白衣白巾，對照以後，使我們的情緒轉變了方向，一個女人這樣哭着：　　「我們大大盼和平，盼到了和平，你却死去了，天呀，你却死去了！」　　江南人知道對外的戰事是和平了，哭着她們新喪的丈夫。北方人的另一種不和平，還在延長着，如此春光中該欲哭無淚呵！這樣的想着，走到了南鎭殿前。一樣的，金兵的勝利早成過去，但後南錠殿的建築可以想像出當年異族侵略下我們死了多少人；乃至我們的帝王也終於遭受途毒。只是人心未死，才有這紀念的建築；現在的異族退了，然而由於內部戰亂的繼續存在，我們紀念抗戰中為國犠牲的建築，竟無暇及此，我們眞不如古人。　　再前進，山路崎嶇了，杜鵑更多，為着死去的人而野哭的也更多。這眞該是「民族掃墓節」，「紙灰化作白蝴蝶，血淚染成紅杜鵑」，我們沐浴在美麗的悲哀中；悲哀的美麗中。凄艷蝕骨，不能自拔！忽然大風過去，一陣松濤，全身振奮了不少；於是一口氣跑上了最高峯。　（三十六年清明節記）記阿蓮  —寄內金山—　　阿　最小女也。稚態可喜。往年有紀事四章，今春予來滬上，連以發疹未携，閒輒念之，偶（成此首，紀前所米盡。白蕉幷記　　阿蓮展小我最憐，髮鳥肉嫩身體圓。口中常唱小白兔，袋裏慣藏碎花磚；討糕索餅來膝下，牽衣呼爺百盤旋，卻怪人小脾氣大，當面又說不頑皮；大人呼　儘不理，獨樂其樂多戲　，轉身不見無尋處，打門如客笑爺疑、見核別皮知有食，跟兄覓姊防吃　；抽將稻草作鞭使，提住狸貓當馬騎，金魚缸邊一身水，靑石櫈頭兩掌泥；粞榖散地每呼鴨，聞聲尋蛋還趕鷄，世事如此賴爾時一笑，阿連阿連無罪英青吿山妻！　白蕉二月  林詠泉　　二月從春梅底枝條上開放了　　二月從堤柳底長綫上飄來了　　二月從綿輭的草地上走來了　　風戲舞着家們上底春聯　　兒童戲舞着紙　　　二月旅行在大地上　　二月風是懶洋洋地　　如蛺蝶綏蕩在芬芳的花林中　　它綏蕩在馨香的髮林中　　你蜜蜂，你噥語着什麽驅　　你花　蕾，你憨視着什麽呢　　你少女，你痴想着什麽呢　　風吹拂在溫柔的水面上　　船浮游在油樣的綠波中　　乘舟人讀着：「二月底夢」三月  林詠泉　　三月　　多麼乘畢的，　　忙碌的季節啊！　　你能訴說三月的記憶嗎？　　你曾靜靜地者花開花落。　　靜靜地檢拾花底屍體，　　花底遣　嗎？　　我則是太糢糊了。　　三月如一陣　政喧天　　　掠過我底耳邊啊；　　三月如一　紅男綠女，　　跑過我底眼前啊。追思王丹揆先生  施翀鵬　　霍紳王丹揆先生作古，已六年了！他在六年以前抗戰期間，因為祟明淪陷，避居上海孤島，敵偽一再去威脅利誘，他始終抱着富貴不移，威武不屈的精神，屹然不動，　居在醫院裏。後來；因為居室逼仄，受了著毒，發生鼻癌，經過了許多名醫診治，終以八十二的高齡，遂吿不起。當時，國府眷念他的忠貞卓絕，特為明令麥揚。不久孤島也吿淪陷，這道褒揚令直到勝利之後才頒到。足見政府對於年高德劭火節凜然的耆老，並未遺忘。　　丹老先生治學服官的態度，是十分謹嚴廉正，他雖然處在科舉的封建時代，他也參加鄉試，會試，中孝廉，成進士，點翰林之類的掄選，可是他服官之後，肆意研求經濟實用之學，抱着霖雨蒼生的旨趣來從政，年生舉辦鐵路交通，水利建設等等，都是和國計民生有極大關係的事業。決不是一般士大夫吟風弄月，坐耗公帑者可比。　　最近，江蘇省臨時參議會，發動公葬韓國鈞，陳陶遺，張一鏖等，由參議員黃森提議，請將王丹老也參加公葬，這是全蘇人士一致的要求，因為丹老的功業道德於這韓陳張三位先生，是不相上下的。現在；省參會已決定了，不久要組織公葬委員會來舉行公葬。語云：「鄉先生沒而可祭於社」，丹老則當之無愧矣！爰題五古一首，表示筆者個人的追思。　　小子生也晚，識公十五年，幼時聞公名，心竊喜墓焉！稍長瞻威儀，肅穆無拘牽，弱冠拜門下，和煦如春天。大智渾若愚，高深莫測淵？不以長揖拒，辱荷屈周旋，譞我名一藝，獎掖更勉旃！春明秋則日，幾度執公鞭，循循施敎澤，誠悅無閒然！門牆數千仞，仰高復鐟堅，公秉趨庭訓，義理學百川，程業並探索，王陸異同研。文章經濟道，公自有心傳，早歲掇巍科，騰驤廊廟前。宜勞農商務，直聲觸奸愆，眞除膺外簡，提刑實左遷。理財執路政，弊絕挽利權。泱泱具區水，流澤萬頃田，公不憚胼胝，吳越免顚述。監論水之利，未嘗讓前賢！崇邑滄桑變，塘工得保全，籌策具卓見，公實居其先。慈善公益事，飢溺更拳拳，國族鄉邦難，安危繫公肩。耄義不倦勤，期頤信有綠，詎因憂國足，鬰結病魔纏。善人受天祐，吉士可綿綿，誰謂攖小極？遽爾歸神仙。巨星忽已殞，泰山眞欲顚，狂風暴雨催，神號鬼涕漣，薄海同聲哭，我豈僅鳴咽？景祟碩德望，追悼有豆籩，勛名千載下，傳記太倉編。（唐蔚芝撰傳）貽我手札稿，墨瀋猶新鮮，寸禇彌可貴，數且逾百篇。珍拱什襲藏，吉光片羽聯，莊誦三周過，宛似在公邊。幽明痛興路，淚下透遺斐。望  王聰　　眸十遺留在　　天邊，　　再也應不見　　自己；　　一片瓦礫，　　是被珍惜過底。　　（自註）四年前在重慶的近郊——靑木關，我無愛亦無憎地將這首小詩紀錄在一張廢紙上。次年春天，我整居北溫泉，很偶然地這首小詩從一本破書裏飄落在地上。適李長之兄在側，拾起沉吟再四，為此小詩末句增一過字。四目相射，彼此會心一笑；我遂將藍烟似的感激，飛騰於靈魂的窗　。霧  沙蕾　　一片霧在我們間降落了，我看不見你　　在以前聽來那麼親切的聲音，想來那麽熟悉的面影，現在都糢糊着，有的嘶啞，有的變形。　　幸福的臉被拉長，或壓扁，以致看來那麽生疏，使我凄傷。　　曲譖在我的囊中，而童符零落如花瓣了。　　路展開着如一支筆直的箭，它將射向那兒呢？　　我不能設想你的笑聲，我也聽到你的哭泣。　　如果我能聞着你眼淚的氣息，我就有了笑顏了。　　如果我能嘗着你眼淚的鹹味，我又找到了海水的歡呼。　　連你的一縷最輕的太息我也找不到，因此我夜夜傾聽雨聲的浙瀝。　　不要以為我會有快樂。燈光是溫婉的，而溫婉得太寥落，太凄傷。　　對著明鏡，也只映照我盈盈的憂心。　　看不見你，我也看不見我自己　　在霧中，我只是索摸着步行。　　也許我走進了一座暖花房，那兒有玫瑰永不凋謝。　　也許我走進了伊甸樂園，天社允許我永久的生存和永久的淸涼。　　但是我在哀哭着，被幸福和光撫愛過的心在噴着血，我時時聽到靈魂作響如裂帛聲。　　因為我找不到你，我感覺不到火，逸樂與死亡。　　國為當你走近我的時候我選取了另外一條路徑，霧便彌漫在我的四周了。　　你看我這樣地跌落，在霧中，我的眼色淪入遠古陰森。黃山畫派  許士騏　　東南山水，以黃山最為幽奇，徐霞客云：「五嶽歸來不看山，黃山歸來不看嶽。」獅林精舍有聯云：「人間有石皆奴僕，天下無山可弟兄。」天都，運花，始信諸峯，巍峨轟立，高出雲表；奇松羅列。蒼勁盤屈，幽　，怪石之奇，絕　危峯之險，雲海瀰漫，窮宇宙之奇觀。明詩人如錢牧齊，共同石齊，程孟陽諸人，寐饡煙霞，流連忘返。　　盡人如漸江，人稱梅花古衲，汪之瑞，查士標，孫無逸，蕭疎簡澹，號稱校報安四家，而石　作車，氣勢磅礡，不事幕今，工力卓絕，遂開黃山一派，繼起者則推宣城梅清，　縣程鳴，及釋弘智等。　　梅淸字遠公，號瞿山，工詩文，以淵博見稱。盡松氣韻蒼警，妙趣天然，山水造境幽邃，敷色冷冷　，嘗作貢山岡，極烟雲飄渺之致，程鳴字友聲，號松門，以書法人畫，中鋒揮　，乾筆枯墨，不事渲染，至饒逸趣。釋弘智，俗姓方，名以智，號密之，桐城人，淡筆點染，不求形似以　機，簡澹意遠，為黃山派之別開生面者。近人汪孔祈，字采白，號洗桐居士歛人，以寫黃山著稱於蛙，運筆秀勁，設色古艷，製有黃海臥遊集行世。惜享年不永，為藝林一大損失。一寸山河一寸血317  葉勁風　　鶴見和正岩這時走進這個公園，看見裏面靜悄悄地，游人稀疎，還不及門外人多。他們沿着大路了了一段，剛繞過一個小灣，就見一個小假山側，幾張長椅上，有些人，在矮樹的蔭下坐着，一眼就見這幾個人中，有兩個人，三十左右吧，穿着一色的白色西服，各人手裏，都有一本紅色西書。　　「作怪了，怎麼是兩個？」鶴見悄悄地吿訴正岩。　　「有計劃的設施哪，一種聽明的掩護。」　　「不管他！」鶴見發命令了，「距離五六碼警備，讓我去接近，」說着便大踏步，逕向第一個着白西服的走過去。　　「中村小姐由本人代表前來……」鶴見話未說畢，瞥見那人已經警覺，突地站了起來，打了一個莫明其妙的手式，對鶴見走來，脚步輕快，逼近鶴見輕輕地說，「隨我來！」邊說邊掠過鶴見身邊，在前引道。　　鶴見覺得這人，舉動突元，却又不甘示弱，一面暗中提備，一面隨着那人前行。那人走了不多幾步，却又突地回轉身來，對鶴見冷笑着，但又很誠懇似的：　　「沒有傷害閣下的意思，只要服從我的話！」　　「什麼意思？」鶴見也冷笑着。　　「到了地點，自然奉吿，這裏不便」。那人斬釘削鐵地說明了。　　「我拒絕你這一套違法的舉動。」鶴見的手，已拊在自己腰間的手槍柄上了。　　「不能拒絕；……請接受我的善意忠吿，…不信，請您回頭看看」那人很冷靜地說着，沒有把鶴見的警備當了一回事。　　鶴見看見那人態度如此冷靜，鎭定，心下也明自他們必有很週到的　備，不由得回過頭云，更瞧明一個究竟。他這一回頭，澄明了目己所料不差，因距離不遠，替自己掩護的正岩？早被另一個白色吳服的人，和一個中國紳士打扮的人，前後監視住了。仕女  謝采琴自由談打風  阿林　　我不是心理學家，不大知道　衆與社會心理的變化。不過，似乎在一個並不承平的紛亂的境遇裏，人的心理也恒常是不能十分正常的。這也許解答了為什麽飢餓者容易仇恨，倦怠者易於激怒的緣故了。　　這些日子來，在「擠」與「亂」裏討生活的人們，糾粉也似乎特別的多。而且也太多是非不求公論，一言不合，出乎就打。各地毀報館一也，士兵打戲院二也，兵警互打三也，學生與軍人衝突四也，於是開打成風，造成一種不大良好的眞氣。　　打，自然打不出一個結果，也自然打不出一個道理來，最後二敗俱傷，如是而已。然而社會秩序破壞了，一種和平的空氣也被破壞了。如同濟大學因校車斜紛，到今天還在罷課中，曠廢學業，這損失不祗是學生，也是社會的損失。　　我們的社會，現在第一首要的是建立秩序，從多年的戰亂中復員過來。今日社會的兩大病就是「擠」，就是「亂」，「擠」會加深「亂」的現象，故去「亂」之道就是秩序的重建。而打風則反其道而行，使我們社會不能保持常態的平和。　　這一種打風眞需要遏止，這一種非常的心理也應該根絕才行。青年自殺  夢古　　鄧君運鴻，武漢大學畢業，服務直接稅局，同居一室，前月失踪，昨日證明投黃浦江自殺，讀絕筆書，感慨愴然。　　其致叔嬸一書略云：「姪生性掘强，與世難治，前途黯淡，生意索然，旣不能承歡慈顏，以娛晚景，又不能獨立特行，創基立業……生對家庭不能協助，生又何益……」。論者謂鄧君是進代的犠牲者，筆者同感。　　考其自殺原因，說得明明白白，「前途轉黯淡，不能創基立業，」憤恨之情，溢於言表，此與其也自殺，截然不同。筆者識鄧君僅一月，見彼每晚到舍，必盡讀日間所有各報，對政治，對經濟，對社會，輟發表下古言論，對人人生存，對青年出路，恒言前途渺茫，奮鬧不易。筆者許認為此時此地發發牢騷，除持殊階級者外，實為今日普遍現象，鄧君決心避世，出於意料，此非個人問題，實為整個的社會問題。　　一部份人謂鄧君看社會形態極其透澈，故下此決心自殺。一部份人謂鄧君年少力强，努力奮鬥，前途無量，創墓立業，須假時日，且環境劣於鄧君在飢餓綫上掙扎浙如恒河沙，何必出此下策，總之，贊成者有贊成者的看法，惋惜者有惋惜者的理由。上海居住，聲色引誘，慾望不達，若悶自然業生。但自殺，總是暴露社會的弱點，如若將來能有一天不再有人自殺，社會多少在進步吧。原子彈與宇宙綫  建華　　投擲兩入原子彈在廣島，長崎，結束了第二次世界大戰，人類歷史的進程上，都引起了新的創造和篤駭。原子彈可使物質毀滅，可使生命死亡，它的威力，確能鎭懾動的世界，確予人們以强大的恐怖。　　不過，原子彈不是新的東西，遠在十九世紀之末，法國的科學家柏克勒爾及居里夫人，早已在原子學理上有重大的發明。即在第二次大戰　初期，德國的科學家海森堡與虎滋敎授等，曾在一決定性的會議席上，報吿原子彈可在兩年以內製造成功。徒以希特勤心情的暴爆，對於任何超過六個月的軍事計劃，均不耐考慮。不然的話，德國原子彈的造成，也許早於美國。　　現聞納粹政府下的權威科學家杜泊爾和貝洛洛加博士，已受蘇聯的邀請，赴蘇至加　子工作，其待遇除月薪六千　布外，每月尙可特別配給鮮肉五十磅，並有舒適住宅十所。重賞之下，必有勇夫。所以不久的將來，蘇聯的原子炸彈，將與美國較量其威力的可能。　　目下原子彈的製造，各國已成公開的秘密，在一般科學家看來，製造原子彈，竟是工程問題，不復為科學問題了。倫敦著名數學家魯斯說；美國的原子彈專利，決不能維持五年，在這五年以內，任何非工業國家，祇須有鈉的產量，均可制造原子彈。此說如果實現，那末大家都有原子彈，未來戰爭勝負的決定性·原子彈失其效用、要靠海陸空軍，以及人事與社會的組織力等等全體性的配合了。　　華盛頓巴爾托研究院院長史璜氏，預料原子彈將成强弩之未，故近已竭力研究宇宙綫。據說宇宙綫所發射的能力，較之原子彈能力，至少强一千億倍以上。不過此種宇宙綫，尙未能加以控制，在地球大氣層以外的宇宙綫來源，也至今尙未確悉，現距成功之途，尙需相當時日。假使一旦成功，全世界變化到如何模樣，自非吾人今日所能想象。首相的兒子  季水　　英國苜相的兒子，馬丁·艾德里在貨船上充當水手，來上海的一件儈炙人口的新聞。自然，凡是看看報的人，都不會輕輕放過的。我的感想，也正同所有看報的人一樣，「感慨萬千」。其次，某報記者提出的二個問題，却也的　　得怪：　　「那麼，你要到什麼時候，纔能升到船主的位子呢？」　　「你為什麽不繼續你父親的事業，去學政治呢？」　　雖然，這或者是記者應有的口吻，但也究竟充分表示了我們中國人的習氣。　　我們國度裏的人的習氣之一是「向上」，投筆從戎，不是為民族國家，而祗在「覓封侯」。讀書不在求知識，而在「出仕」，以己度人，小艾德里的充當水手，自然不在喜歡航海，而在升到船主，急急乎要問個明白；但是英美人沒有這樣的習氣，所以小艾德里為之「張大了眼睛，笑了起來」，還有一種習氣是「搭便船」。有做官的爸爸，兒子也做官，爸爸在銀行公司裏當董事長，兒子便是總經理，爸爸在耕田，兒子也祗好務農了，把個性泯滅了，做了為環境支配的奴隸，以這些習氣去看「指一般的看」小艾德里，自然要問出「為什麽」來的。　　其實，這種新聞，在民主先進的英美，更不算一會事，現在我們的國家也走上了民主的邊緣，這稱玩固的不民主的習氣，得首先改革一下。論觸機之巧  慕陶　　明崇禎之殉國也，內監王承恩，實從而殉主，有明一代之權閹，如王振，劉瑾，魏忠賢輩」其盜竊政權，殘害忠良，實有史以來未有之元惡大熟。漢之十常侍，淸之　聯英，誠卑之不是道矣，乃亦有忠干其主，如王承恩其人者，人之賢興奸，相去豈不遠哉！　　相傳流寇李自成，將犯京哉風聲已緊，崇禎命承恩至前門測一友字，其時有謝石者，測字聖手也，問承恩何事？對以問時局。謝曰：「此字反字已出頭，大事去矣」。承恩曰：「易一有無之有，如何？謝曰：「此字更不佳，蓋大明江山，已去一半也」。承恩曰：「此時正酉時，易「酉字」。謝曰：「此字至尊已去頭足，尙何曾　」！三字皆能觸機立斷，亦云巧矣。洛陽牡丹  又今　　艷陽天氣，正是牡丹花仰大開的季節。　　報　政府耗款千萬，泯員赴洛陽購運牡丹，這眞是太平時代的盛事。我們　該記者「十叢深色花，十室中人賦」的　諫詩，也許在今日物價高漲的時候，一　花還不止十室中人之賦稅而已。　　白居易有一首長詩，題目就呌做牡丹芳，那是善天子憂農而寫的。末後有這埭獎句：「三代以還文勝質，人心重華不重實，重華直至牡丹芳，其來有漸非今日。……我願暫求造化力，减却牡丹妖艷色，少廻卿十　花心，同似吾君憂稽。」　　當時的天子，據說是重藝積的，而卿士大夫則虛花，我們不知道目前的情形究竟如何？但在農村經濟日漸枯涸，而國庫又極度空虛應付困難的時候，那月閒錢講買大量的牡丹花呢？　　一般當貴中人，從來不把人民生計擺在心上，却在牡丹身上做起工夫來，須知道「牡丹雖好，全仗綠華扶持」，人民如果勉强可以充充綠　的話，請大人們不要單者花而不看葉。　　何況牡丹的紅紫紛披，也許還是北方人民的血淚染成的，難道買花人和賞花人，竟然絲毫無動於中嗎？　　周濂溪說：「牡丹，花之當貴者也，……牡丹之愛，宜乎眾矣！」　　富貴和和妖艷和庸信，從古迄今，都是結下不結之緣的，有心人怎得不為之齒冷！藝文壇　　開明魯店十週年的時侯，出過一部小說集「十年一，敦請當代作象各寫一篇，算是紀念開明，同時紀念新文學的長成。去年是開明二十週年。於是又出一本「開明二十週年紀念文集」，內有呂叔湘，郭沫若，顧頡剛，藥伯贊等的文字九篇，售價九千元。在目前學術空氣稀薄的出版界，這是値得注意的一件事。　　留美名畫家王少陵，原籍廣東臺山，於抗戰一年復出國，潛心研究美術，嘗參加夫國畫展比賽會，所作油畫及水彩畫，通獲數獎。又在各大美術院舉行個人晝展多次，深得中外人士好評。王君除致力藝術外，對華僑敎育亦甚努力，會執敎各僑校多年，及任紐約華僑公立學校校長，哥倫比亞大學藝術系助敎。最近回國，在南京國立中央大學舉行展覽，本月六日曾參加文藝茶話會報吿「中國藝術家家在美國」。危城記  秦瘦鷗　　「祝先生！怎麽辦呢？」兩手各提着一口大皮箱的老黃透着一臉憂急的神氣，大聲地向老祝問。　　老祝的肩上馱着已為當前的景　所嚇得發昏的榮兒，連他自己也不知道該怎麼辦。　　關一手＃着緋緋，一手提着一個大包裏，也呆着臉無所遺從。　　「慢一些，讓我先去打聽一下！」隔了四五分鐘，還是老祝比較有一些主意，他把榮兒放了下來，讓也和緋緋手拉手的拘著，自己便使出混才的力，從人海裏像逆水行舟一樣的擠挨過云。　　他這一去足足隔了三刻鐘才回來，胸背兩部所淌的汗，已濕透了他穿的那件麻質的夏威夷衫，嗓子也啞了許多，但臉上的神氣倒很興奮，似乎已打聽到了什麼好消息。　　「走，快走！」他向他們說，立刻又把小榮馱了起來。　　蘭，她的堂兄老黃阿李也就莫明其妙地跟着他分開了後面才積聚起來的人堆，竭力衝出去；一路上緋緋至少跌了三個觔斗。　　「我們上二塘云！」到了外面人比較稀少的所在，老祝才喘一口氣，回頭告訴蘭。「方才車站上有一個朋友告訴我，今晚祗有一列車可能開出去，但車站上候着的人實在太多了，開進來怕要關禍，所以他們打算改在那邊岔路上調車，祗有已包定車皮的幾個機關裏的人知道。讓我們趕上那邊去！大致還可以上得了車！」　　「對：這消息準不會錯」！蘭的堂兄農欣然地六。　　「可是，蘭向四週望了一望。「我們怎麼去呢？」　　這倒是一個問題，但並沒有難倒老祝；他又匹馬彈槍地跑開去奔了一圈，不久便押了三輛洋車來；一輛半裝了行李，一輛半裝了蘭和她的子女。緋緋獨自坐在第二輛車上，脚下和背後都堆了東西，她有些書怕，老祝便傍着她的車子走，蘭的堂兄和老黃阿李都隨在第三輛洋車的後面。　　星月交輝的夜晚，映得公路上像舖上了霜一樣；三輛洋車和四個人組成了短短的一個行列，在靜寂的空氣裏行進著。蘭抱着榮兒坐在第一輛洋車上，勉强還保持了一·二分她所特具的堅强的鎭定，時時回頭來活排緋，却不敢望老祝的臉上看。（四四）密約  子愷</p>

The Chairman stood in the car, and amidst the sound of military music, inspected the ranks. Commander Xuan and other officers followed in four jeeps.

<p>After the review, the Chairman returned to the reviewing stand to address all the officers and soldiers. At that time, Chief of Staff Chen stood to the Chairman's left, and the guests stood in a row on the right.</p>
<p>In his address to the Youth Army, the Chairman first explained that the purpose of the National Revolution was to implement the Three Principles of the People of the founding father of the nation and build a prosperous and happy new China. Revolutionary soldiers should ensure the freedom and equality of the nation and the people under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People, so that they would be worthy of being followers of the founding father and descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The Chairman then encouraged the Youth Army soldiers in the camp to strictly abide by discipline, obey orders, be autonomous, self-governing, self-reliant, and self-strengthening, so that they would be worthy of being sound soldiers. To the demobilized Youth Army cadres, he instructed them to adhere to the spirit of sacrifice, stick to their posts, work hard, implement the livelihood principle, and build a new national society, so that they would be worthy of being free and independent citizens.</p>
<p>After leaving Zhongzheng Park at 11:20 a.m., the Chairman went to the Central Training Corps Shanghai Branch to inspect and addressed all the officers and officials of the police officer class.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen's Speech</h3>
<p>After the Chairman left, Chief of Staff Chen continued to address all the officers and soldiers, saying: "After Japan surrendered, in order to seek peaceful unification and build a prosperous and happy country, the Central Government spared no effort to tolerate and concede to the Communist Party in the hope of achieving this goal, but the more the Central Government endured, the more arrogant the Communist Party became, not only refusing peace talks, but also refusing to recognize the Constitution and the Central Government. In recent months, they have launched a full-scale military offensive, and the government has no choice but to fight back. Also, because the only method the Communist Party uses towards the people is deception, the people in all the areas that have been occupied by the Communist army hate them bitterly. Therefore, we must help the people organize themselves and select revolutionary comrades to take on the work of organizing the people, so that the people will no longer fear the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>You are revolutionary cadres, and the Chairman has already entrusted us with a major mission.</p>
<p>Today our responsibility is too heavy, we must shoulder this responsibility: (1) eliminate bandits, (2) strengthen production, solve people's livelihood, (3) do not become the object of revolution. Finally, please note that before the Japanese enemy surrendered, we could not come to this park. Now, under the leadership of the Chairman, we have defeated the Japanese army and abolished the unequal treaties, so this park is renamed Zhongzheng Park. Today we can gather here is something to be proud of, but the revolution has not yet succeeded, and it is hoped that we can complete the task of the National Revolution in our hands, and when that time comes, it will be even more enjoyable to gather here again."</p>

<h3>Regarding the Issue of Convening a Peace Conference with Germany; Foreign Minister Wang's Solemn Statement; Demands Strict Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the issue of the peace conference with Germany on the 14th: "How should the peace conference with Germany be convened? Which country should convene it? And which countries can participate? All these issues should be decided by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the five countries. No member of the council has the prerogative to decide this issue. Any decision that is not generated by the Council of Foreign Ministers as a whole would be an ultra vires act in terms of the organizational rules of the Council of Foreign Ministers and would violate the Potsdam Agreement establishing the Council of Foreign Ministers. I have repeatedly notified the four foreign ministers meeting in Moscow of the Chinese government's position. My action is not to ask them to give me any extra-legal concessions, but only to demand the strict implementation of the Potsdam Agreement. The foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States have accepted my view in their replies to me and have stated that they will insist on their position, while the Soviet foreign minister has not yet adopted the same view. I believe that if there is a dispute over the meaning of the organizational rules of the Council of Foreign Ministers, the opinion that should be respected should naturally be the opinion of the majority, not the opinion of the minority. The Treaty of Peace with Germany is one of the most important issues in world peace. The Chinese government not only believes that China must bear a share of the responsibility for convening the peace conference with Germany, but also believes that the organization of this peace conference must be expanded as much as possible so that all countries participating in the war against Germany have the right to attend the peace conference, and so that their general opinions can receive greater attention than at the Paris Peace Conference last year. China has not yet accepted the proposal of the foreign ministers of the four drafting countries to provide opinions on the German peace treaty. Until the issue of convening the peace conference with Germany is properly resolved, the Chinese government will reserve the freedom of all its future actions."</p>
<h3>Differing Attitudes on Japanese Reparations Issue; Government Quietly Awaits Disposition by Allied Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Attitudes towards the issue of reparations from Japan vary among different parties. The government remains calm and awaits disposition by the Allied Headquarters. The Communist Party fiercely opposes the early removal of machinery. The Liberal Party hopes that the machinery will not be removed and that manufactured goods will be used as reparations. Although newspapers have published detailed news on reparations, most editorials remain silent. Recently, only the Mainichi Shimbun expressed its support for early removal of reparations "to end the anxious and suspicious state of the industry and enable it to understand its situation and plan future activities." The Democratic Party and the National Cooperative Party have responded positively. The Liberal Party expressed the hope that Japan can retain its machinery and factories and use manufactured goods as reparations. The Communist Party fiercely opposes early removal, saying that it will make Japan's post-war industry greatly difficult and aggravate the unemployment problem. They advocate that "reparations should continue until Japan can become industrially self-reliant again." The Japanese government has little to say about this and is now quietly awaiting orders from the Allied Headquarters."</p>

<h3>Impressions of Northern Jiangsu Folk Life (3): Broken Highways and Long Coastlines</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>The highway line connecting Tongzhou, Rugao, and Hai'an is the lifeline for the National Army's supplies in northern Jiangsu. The reporter group's activities in northern Jiangsu this time also relied entirely on these highway lines, providing us with many conveniences.</p>
<p>We spent half of our entire interview program sitting in ten-wheeled trucks, almost shaking our bones loose. The plains of northern Jiangsu are mostly loose sandy soil, so when the car travels on the highway, it is as if we have arrived in the desert area of Mongolia. Gusts of wind and sand rolled up from behind the car, engulfing not only the trees and houses beside the road, but also the travelers sitting in the car. Before the car had traveled ten miles, every passenger's face was "completely unrecognizable." Hair and eyebrows were covered with a layer of yellow dust. Seeing each other's strange appearance, we couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>A section chief Chen from the headquarters accompanied us to eat dust together. He was still fortunate that the weather was helping, and we could still run around east and west amidst the flying sand and rocks. Otherwise, the highway would be a muddy mess, and the car wouldn't be able to move.</p>
<p>It is said that the authorities, considering that the highway is not suitable for rainy season activities, which affects military affairs to no small extent, plan to tunnel through a small mountain next to Langshan to use as paving material. However, the plan is too large, and manpower and financial resources cannot be managed for a while. The current transition method is to have the people laboriously utilize the broken bricks from the remaining walls of the demolished buildings and pile them on the highway to replace the stone pavement, so as to prevent the entire wheel from sinking into the mud during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Such a road surface not only makes the passengers suffer, but also harms the car. If a car is driven in Shanghai, assuming it has a lifespan of five years, then it can all be sent to its end in just one year on the highway in northern Jiangsu. Also, because the road surface is too uneven, we can often hear some tragic cases of "yellow croakers" being thrown off and falling to their deaths from the tops of cars carrying cotton bales from Dongtai to Nantong.</p>
<p>I once talked to a road repairer, and he felt that this road repair work was inexplicable. He said, "When the New Fourth Army came, they told us to destroy the highway. When the National Army came, they told me to restore it immediately." Finally, he smiled and said, "I destroyed this small section of road with my own hands, but I also restored it with my own hands, and the time interval was only a few hours. The former was a nighttime affair, and the latter was a daytime affair." After he finished speaking, he laughed innocently.</p>
<p>In addition to these broken highways, northern Jiangsu is also naturally endowed with a long coastline. To put it bluntly, the National Army has maintained the highway line, while the Communist Army controls the coastal area. Militarily speaking, the only obstacle to the suppression work in northern Jiangsu is that the National Army has not yet been able to ensure security in the coastal area. In the past, the province had a planned organized water police force, but so far, personnel and funds have become a problem. We have only heard the stairs creak, but no one has come down. At the same time, the coast of northern Jiangsu also has unique characteristics. Because of the accumulation of sand, large sea vessels cannot approach the coastline. It is necessary to build ships separately, which is not enough to talk about prevention and control. Therefore, the provincial government's plan has invisibly become empty talk on paper. The Communist Army, however, has used the terrorist policies of burning and killing, and the opportunistic policy of reforming land, to control coastal fishing boats and dust people, and even used the intricate port and river channels to create a "modern Liangshan Marsh." As a result, the residents living in the coastal area of northern Jiangsu can no longer talk about living and working in peace. In the past, the rural economy of the vast reclamation area has been forced to the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Here is a small story, from which we can see the activities of the Communist Army in the coastal area and the number of troops. Originally, there is a special product in northern Jiangsu, white shrimp. When the Communist Army occupied the area, because they were all searched and plundered, the market price in the Nantong area would be as high as five or six thousand yuan per catty. But when the Communist Army fled elsewhere, the white shrimp would immediately plummet. So, when we can eat white shrimp for over a thousand yuan a catty, we can definitely appreciate that the Communist Army has once again scurried to another place, or that their troops have been reduced.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Sunshine Appears in the Korean Situation</h3>
<p>At the time of the visit of the Korean revolutionary leader, Syngman Rhee, to China, reports related to the development of the Korean situation have been coming from various sources. The Chinese people and the people of the Three Han Kingdoms are as close as brothers, so we pay close attention to the situation in Korea. We feel gratified that from these reports from various places, we can already see an outline of the possible development of the situation, at least it can have a clarifying effect on the situation that has developed in Korea from the time of the Japanese surrender to the present. Some sunshine has appeared in the dense haze. We welcome the appearance of sunshine.</p>
<p>The recent reports on the Korean situation that are available are: (1) When the Korean revolutionary leader, Syngman Rhee, visited Chairman Chiang yesterday, according to news reports, Chairman Chiang immediately expressed his great sympathy for Korea's struggle for independence and said: China and Korea have always been brotherly states, and they should help each other and cooperate. China has decided to make its greatest efforts to assist Korea in establishing a government; (2) In the foreign ministers' conference currently being held in Moscow, US Secretary of State Marshall recently sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, criticizing the Soviet Union's actions in Korea, demanding that the Soviet Union, in accordance with the agreement on Korea made at the Moscow Conference of the Three Great Powers in 1945, promptly reopen the Soviet-American Joint Commission in Korea to support the establishment of an independent Korean government, and requesting that a date be set this summer to review the achievements of the Joint Commission and the policies towards Korea. Marshall also stated at the end of his letter that if the Soviet Union does not agree to these issues, the US government is prepared to take the necessary steps in southern Korea to implement the agreement on the Korean situation reached at the Moscow Conference of the Three Great Powers in 1945; appropriating US$200 million to promote the recovery of South Korea, this appropriation may eventually be increased to US$500 or 600 million.</p>
<p>China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth, and the Chinese people always hope that Korea's independence and unification can be realized as soon as possible; the Chinese government can also give sincere support to Korea's independence and unification in accordance with the public opinion of the people. At the time of the Cairo Conference, the four powers fighting against Japan decided on the basic policy to be adopted towards Korea. Supporting the emergence of an independent and unified Korea and upholding the spirit of the Cairo Declaration can be said to be the Chinese government's basic policy towards Korea. This time, when Syngman Rhee came to China, Chairman Chiang once again reiterated our policy towards Korea; that is, he greatly sympathized with Korea's struggle for independence; China and Korea have always been brotherly states, and they should help each other and cooperate. China has decided to make its greatest efforts to assist Korea in establishing a government. The clarity of the Chinese government's policy towards Korea is evident here. Due to the current various signs, although the man-made obstacles in Korea may not be eliminated for a while, the establishment of a provisional Korean government in the near future may be within the realm of possibility. Even if its power cannot reach the entire Korean territory, the establishment of a provisional government will undoubtedly greatly benefit the development of the Korean situation. We sincerely hope that the establishment of this government will be in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Precisely because we have such a strong expectation for Korea's independence, we hope that the Korean people can sincerely cooperate to establish their political power, consolidate their political power, and ensure the independence and autonomy of their nation. According to news brought back by those who have recently inspected Korea, the political groups in Korea are like bamboo shoots after rain, numbering over two hundred. On the one hand, this is enough to show the Korean people's political awakening, which is a gratifying phenomenon; on the other hand, it also indicates the decline of the spirit of cooperation, resulting in the emergence of so many political groups. There is strength in unity; therefore, we hope that the people of the Three Han Kingdoms can discard their prejudices and step up cooperation. We feel gratified that when Syngman Rhee met with Chairman Chiang, according to news reports, although Rhee expressed that he and another leader, Kim Gu, cooperated very closely, the Korean people all hoped that they both could serve as leaders; it can be seen that Kim and Rhee have been able to move towards cooperation. We hope that this spirit of cooperation can be further promoted, so that the entire people of the Three Han Kingdoms can be condensed into a solid body and give full play to the mission they will bear in Asian history thereafter.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Enters Decision-Making Stage; Austrian Peace Treaty Expected to be Drafted; Clark Travels from Vienna to Soviet Capital Again</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Moscow, 14th Radio: At today's meeting of the four foreign ministers, Marshall decided to confront Molotov. Marshall will demand that the Soviet side agree in principle to sign a permanent four-power agreement guaranteeing that Germany will not be rearmed. Marshall believes that although the details of the four-power agreement can be discussed at any time, the Soviet Union must indicate its agreement or disagreement on this matter at this time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 13th] After the initial verbal battle at the four foreign ministers' conference, it has begun to enter a decisive week since last night in order to determine whether important resolutions can be reached on the future of Germany and various issues of the Austrian peace treaty. The foreign ministers have now given up hope of resolving the points of contention in the German peace treaty that are obstructing the progress of the closed-door meeting, but the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and the United States still hope to negotiate a compromise solution this week so that the Austrian peace treaty can be drafted before the end of the conference. The consensus of the delegations of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is that if the Soviet Union can make concessions on the Austrian agreement this week, it is expected that the draft can be completed within ten days; if it is not achieved, the deadlock will be broken. The foreign ministers will now expedite this work on Saturday. If no agreement can be reached on a detailed plan for resolving Germany, they will proceed to discuss the US proposal for a four-nation, forty-year agreement to prevent German aggression, as well as the distribution of German coal and the Austrian peace treaty.</p>
<p>Although the United States may submit the four-power agreement for discussion on Monday, it does not expect it to produce any results, as the United Kingdom and France have expressed support for it with reservations, while the Soviet Union has expressed opposition and is unlikely to change its position. Western countries are now pinning their hopes on the Austrian peace treaty so that they will not have nothing significant to show for their departure from Moscow. However, the major obstacle to this matter is the Soviet Union's demand for $100 million worth of German property in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria. The Soviet Union has not yet agreed to the US proposal to determine its ownership. The intention of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is to determine that the Soviet Union should not demand the property that the Nazis forcibly occupied in Austria, but so far there is no tendency for either side to make concessions. However, fair observers say that the Soviet Union, like other countries, is eager for peace in Austria, as this would allow the Soviet Union to stop supplying the costs of occupying Austria and withdraw the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary and Romania to maintain the supply lines to Austria.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 13th] It is heard that General Clark will come to the Soviet capital again from Vienna this week to assist Secretary of State Marshall in conducting conference affairs. Clark returned to Vienna last week because the Austrian peace treaty seemed to be delayed indefinitely. Clark will return to Moscow soon, hoping to discuss the Austrian peace treaty before the end of the conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 13th] An authoritative person said today that the results of the behind-the-scenes negotiations at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference have led the three Western countries to reach an agreement on the method of distributing German coal to France, thereby eliminating one of the main obstacles to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The agreement assumes that the Saar region is economically merged with France, so France obtains most of its coal. The delivery of coal is flexible depending on the amount of production, but it guarantees that France can obtain a certain amount at any time. The United States played a mediating role between the United Kingdom and France, as French Foreign Minister Bidault did not approve of German economic unification unless it was guaranteed that France could obtain sufficient coal. British Foreign Secretary Bevin initially opposed accepting the constraints to supply France, but an agreement was reached after mediation by US Secretary of State Marshall.</p>
<h3>The Two Mr. Marshalls Have Yet to Meet, Causing Various Speculations</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall and Soviet Premier Stalin have yet to meet. Street talk here tonight is increasingly apprehensive. The British and French Foreign Ministers have already entered the Kremlin one after the other, but Mr. Marshall has been staying in Moscow for 35 days without being invited, and to the best of current knowledge, has not sought an audience. Some Soviet people have raised various questions about why Mr. Marshall and Stalin have not yet met, such as: "Is the situation not good?", "Are the two at odds?", "Will Marshall return home directly without being invited or seeking an audience with Stalin?". However, the general opinion is that Mr. Marshall will eventually meet with Stalin before leaving the Soviet Union. Even if there is no invitation, he will seek an audience, and Stalin will be happy to receive him at that time. However, insiders (to borrow a phrase from Soviet writers) say that Stalin has experienced all kinds of things, and his success lies in his ability to wait for an opportunity that is beneficial to him. However, Mr. Marshall is also adept at waiting for opportunities, and Stalin may miss his chance this time. President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey has cast a shadow over the Foreign Ministers' Conference. For months, no action by foreign politicians has shaken the Soviet Union as much as this, which may be the underlying reason why Stalin did not issue an invitation to Marshall. Another group believes that the Kremlin is watching how American public opinion reacts to the "Truman Doctrine." In fact, American criticisms of the Truman Doctrine are being published or broadcasted by newspapers and radio stations here. Today, the newspapers also published Wallace's speech in the UK. Whether Wallace will come to the Soviet Union during this trip has also become a common question among Soviet people.</p>
<h3>The United States' Firm Attitude Should Make the Soviet Union Fearful</h3>
<p>Tydings on American Diplomatic Actions</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] Democratic Senator Tydings recently broadcast a theory stating that the recent diplomatic actions taken by the United States can be summarized as follows: (1) A policy of taking active actions against the Soviet Union; (2) Opposition to the expansion of Soviet power; (3) Opposition to communism in Greece and Turkey; (4) President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey has slightly softened the Soviet attitude. The firmness of the American attitude will surely make the Soviet Union fearful. It is noteworthy that Soviet representatives have made concessions in both the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the United Nations Security Council last week.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Plans to Conclude a Treaty of Alliance with Romania</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] According to information received by the British government, before withdrawing its troops from Romania, the Soviet Union will propose concluding a treaty of alliance with Romania. It is reported that the Romanian trade delegation discussed this issue with the Soviet side during its visit to Moscow last month.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and India Decide to Exchange Ambassadors</h3>
<p>[TASS Moscow, 13th] As a result of the exchange of notes between the Indian Ambassador to China, Menon, and the Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, in early April, it has been agreed that the Soviet government and the Indian government have decided to exchange diplomatic envoys and establish embassies.</p>
<h3>The United Nations Special Session Will Be Held on the 28th of this Month to Seek a Solution to the Palestine Problem</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 13th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie announced today that 29 United Nations member states have agreed to participate in the United Nations General Assembly special session to discuss the Palestine issue. Therefore, I have sent invitations to all member states and decided to hold this special session on the 28th of this month. No one can predict how long the United Nations General Assembly special session will last. The United Kingdom hopes to limit the plan to the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly in September this year, but delegations from some countries may hope to thoroughly discuss this issue. It is expected that the composition of the special committee and its powers will be one of the most difficult issues to resolve. The United Kingdom hopes to participate in this committee itself, but the Arab and Jewish parties should be excluded. Arab countries have not expressed any opinions on this matter, not even on the principle of convening a special session of the United Nations General Assembly, but the Jewish side will probably send representatives to the United Nations General Assembly to present their views.</p>
<h3>The American People Approve the International Trade Charter</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 13th] The State Department announced that the government recently informally sought opinions from people in six major cities on the draft charter of the International Trade Organization, and the ratio of those who approved to those who opposed was thirteen to one. Those who were consulted felt great interest in specific measures to safeguard international economic cooperation.</p>

<h3>Pepper Declines to Become Leader of US Third Party, Advocates Maintaining Two Major Parties</h3>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 13th] Democratic Senator Pepper cabled from Miami today, declining former Vice President Wallace's invitation to become the leader of a third party. Pepper also guaranteed that as long as the Democratic Party maintains a liberal style, he will always be a Democrat. Wallace is currently giving a speech in London, calling President Truman's new foreign policy "brutal imperialism." Pepper's telegram stated: "I have resolutely stated to all liberals that any attempt to organize a third party would be a big mistake. If the Democratic Party is unwilling to carry out its mission of serving the people, there is no need for Wallace and Pepper to launch a third party movement, and the people themselves will launch this movement. I oppose the existence of three major parties in the United States and support only two major parties. I will continue to fight in the Democratic Party and spare no effort to make the Democratic Party a truly free party of the United States." At the same time, Truman flew back to Washington from Kansas City after returning to his hometown to visit relatives. He refused to comment on Wallace's speeches abroad and the domestic telephone labor strike before his trip. Some Democratic senators today advocated asking Truman to expel Wallace from the party and issued a statement denying Wallace's foreign policy declaration. Now some key members of both parties are demanding that the President respond to Wallace and issue a statement to the world that Wallace's words cannot represent the U.S. government. According to the opinions of some first-class political observers, Truman will not allow Wallace's unbridled remarks, and it is expected that the White House will issue a statement soon.</p>
<h3>Wallace Advocates a New Deal, Saying Only "One World" Can Avoid Destruction</h3>
<p>[United Press International London, 13th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace gave a broadcast speech on the British Broadcasting Corporation today, the second anniversary of the death of former President Roosevelt, saying that the United Kingdom now has more "New Dealers" than the United States, and said that "the vast power and wealth of the United States are not used to raise the living standards of some countries that are sufficient to become foreign markets for the United States, but are used for strategic and military aspects. If we do not supply these countries with guns and cannons, but help them with machine tools, we can prevent the economic depression in the United States, and our international trade can make rapid progress, and its economic prosperity is enough to prevent communism from gaining a foothold in the West." He said: The Soviet Union is indeed an expansionist, just like the United Kingdom in the past and the United States in the Pacific and other places today. But I mean that some countries that possess atomic bombs and have not suffered from the ravages of war like the Soviet Union should take on the mission of trying a New Deal to safeguard peace. This New Deal, if implemented in the modern world, can create world prosperity and no longer engage in outdated international bullying of weak countries. I oppose Americans who attempt to rule the world and exploit the world under the pretext of eliminating the red threat, but support other Americans who deeply believe that the task of the United States is to contribute new technologies, increase world production, consumption, trade, and the enjoyment of people around the world. The security of the United Kingdom does not depend on connecting Eastern and Western countries. The United Kingdom can only prosper under "One World". All politicians only talk about "One World", and all scientists and far-sighted people believe that only "One World" can avoid the destruction of the world. The United Kingdom must understand that the world needs to adopt a New Deal, because the United Kingdom's "Old Deal" has been declared a failure.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Offer No Comment</p>
<p>[United Press London, 14th] Wallace's broadcast speech advocated implementing a "New Deal" in the world. Today, all British newspapers published it under large headlines, but rarely offered any comments. The Conservative Daily Mail said that Mr. Wallace is a loyal and well-intentioned person. Although he sees a bright prospect, the path he wants to take is very vague. We believe that Mr. Wallace's goal is inevitably wrong, and his lessons should be published in Washington or Moscow.</p>

<h3>Argentine Ambassador to the Soviet Union Takes Office, Talks Freely About the Relations Between the Two Countries Before His Departure</h3>
<p>[United Press International Argentina, 14th] The newly appointed Argentine Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dr. Cantoni, is determined that when he arrives in the Soviet Union to take office, he will not only represent the Argentine government, but his main task is to "introduce the feelings of the Argentine people towards the Soviet people." Cantoni told reporters before his departure that he hoped to promote the relationship between the Soviet Union and Argentina to become more realistic and prosperous. The Soviet Union is one of the countries most closely related to Argentina's five-year plan, because the completion of President Perón's five-year plan depends on the technology of the United States and the Soviet Union and the labor of Italy. Cantoni expressed his views on the commercial relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina, saying: "Since we established relations with each other, the Soviet Union has allowed all our material requirements. The Soviet Union also sent first-class technical personnel representatives to our country, and when we urgently needed newsprint, it shipped a large amount of newsprint." Cantoni did not believe that the status of the Communist Party in Argentina would affect the relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina, and expressed great doubts about the rumors that Argentina would ban the Communist Party. Since the Soviet Union and Argentina severed relations in 1917, it has been 30 years. When President Perón took office on June 4 last year, a Soviet trade delegation arrived in Argentina, and the Soviet Union and Argentina re-established diplomatic relations on June 6 of the same year. Ambassador Cantoni is the first Argentine representative to enter the Soviet Union in 30 years. The entourage this time includes technical personnel and experts in various fields. Each department of the Argentine government has sent a representative to accompany him, totaling about 50 people.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the Case of Foreign Businessmen Disrupting Financial Markets: Malsbary Sentenced to One Year in Prison, 40,000 Hong Kong Dollars in U.S. Dollars Confiscated, and 20,000 Confiscated and Turned Over to the Public; Foreign Exchange and Gold Parts Exempt from Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The case of foreign businessman Ebbas &amp; Co. illegally buying and selling foreign currencies and disrupting financial markets, the defendant Malsbary, was concluded after a trial by the District Court and sentenced at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Judge Meng Tingke asked the defendant Malsbary his age and origin, then stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Malsbary is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for continuously receiving and paying for foreign currency coupons in order to disrupt financial markets. 40,000 Fuh banknotes and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars are confiscated and turned over to the public." He then explained the reasons for the judgment, stating that the defendant's managed Ebbas &amp; Co., after the National Government announced the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, from February 18 to March 3, received 40,000 Fuh banknotes and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, and also successively sold 200,186.38 U.S. dollars and sold 57,860 U.S. dollars. The Economic Emergency Measures Plan is a rapid measure taken by the government in the event of a major change in the national economy, so it naturally takes effect before being ratified by the legislative body in order to deter and ensure security. Furthermore, because the defendant himself has admitted that the company accepts deposits, it should be regarded as a bank according to law. Since the defendant is the manager of the company, he should bear criminal responsibility and is sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Except for the U.S. dollars that have already been paid out, which cannot be confiscated, the telegraphic transfers (TT) and mail transfers (DD) bought and sold by the company are different from foreign currency coupons as stipulated in Article 7 of the Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency Coupons. Although the Central Bank has not issued a business license, it is also a violation of Article 24 of the revised Provisional Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange. However, since there is no special express provision for punishing the manager in this article, it is difficult to immediately order the defendant to bear criminal responsibility. Regarding whether the 38 taels of gold seized should be punished, it should be determined based on whether the company managed by the defendant bought, sold, received, or paid for it after the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was announced. Now, after reviewing its accounts, there was no buying, selling, receiving, or paying behavior after February 17, and holding gold does not constitute a crime. Regarding this part, it should be exempt from discussion. It was also announced that if he does not accept the judgment, he can appeal within ten days after receiving the judgment. The defendant's defense attorney, Chen Tingrui, stood up and requested permission to post bail during the appeal period and stated that regardless of whether the defendant himself appeals or not, the defense attorney will independently appeal in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law. The court will rule on the application for bail in writing, and Malsbary will remain in custody.</p>
<h3>Reynolds' Bomber, a Round-the-World Flight Special Plane, Passed Through Shanghai This Morning, Stopping for One Hour and Twenty Minutes to Refuel, and Continued Flying to Tokyo to Cross the Sea Back to the United States</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] American pen magnate Reynolds' "Reynolds' Bomber" special plane for a round-the-world flight took off from New York at 6:11 a.m. Shanghai time on the 13th. After passing through Newfoundland, Paris, Cairo, and Calcutta, it arrived safely at Jiangwan Airport in this city at 2:00 p.m. today (summer time). It stayed in Shanghai for one hour and twenty minutes and continued to take off for Tokyo at 3:20 p.m. It will take the route of Anchorage, Alaska, pass through Seattle on the west coast of the United States, and go straight back to New York.</p>
<p>The U.S. military airport in Jiangwan had made various preparations for the landing of Reynolds' special plane the night before. The plane was originally rumored to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, but later news came that it would arrive at 4:00 p.m. However, at that time, there was news that it would be delayed until 9:00 p.m. Finally, in the evening, it was confirmed that the plane had left Calcutta at 6:03 p.m., and it was estimated that it would arrive at midnight.</p>
<p>At 2:00 a.m. this morning, the plane landed at Jiangwan Airport. The plane is a twin-engine A-26 giant plane. The fuselage is silver, and the nose and tail are painted blue, which is quite beautiful. After landing, refueling began immediately. Reynolds himself also served as the navigator in the plane.</p>
<p>Reynolds originally planned to complete the round-the-world flight in 55 hours, but in Paris and Cairo, there were slight delays due to refueling and mechanical failures, so it has actually exceeded the scheduled time. However, Reynolds firmly believes that he can still create a new record for round-the-world flights. According to the existing record of 91 hours and 12 minutes, it is held by Huth.</p>
<h3>Dai Rulin Suspected of Murder, the District Prosecutor's Office Filed a Public Prosecution, and the Families of the Deceased Officers and Soldiers Petitioned Many Places</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The case of Dai Rulin, captain of the Hai Min steamship, the defendant in the Fu Bo warship tragedy, has been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Cao Hong of the District Prosecutor's Office. It is believed that when the Fu Bo warship was hit and sunk, the Hai Min steamship ignored it and did not rescue the officers and soldiers who fell into the water, attempting to escape, causing more than 100 officers and soldiers of the entire warship to die. This constitutes the crime of murder under the Criminal Law. Since Dai Rulin is the captain of the Hai Min steamship, he should bear all criminal responsibility. The crimes under Article 55, Article 271, Paragraph 1, Article 15 of the Criminal Law and Article 128 of the Maritime Law are combined, and a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>In addition, 46 family members of the deceased officers and soldiers of the Fu Bo warship organized a petition group and went to the District Prosecutor's Office to petition at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Prosecutor Cao Hong, who was in charge of the case, received them, comforted them, and stated that the court would handle the case fairly. The petition group then went to President Chiang's residence, the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, the Navy Headquarters, and the Bar Association to petition. Finally, they went to the District Court, where President Zha received them and stated that the court would not be affected by anything and would judge fairly.</p>
<h3>Suspected Arson in Zhabei and Pudong, Two Cases</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] A strange fire occurred at the Boai Barber Shop at No. 36 Datong Road at 3:00 a.m. on the 13th. Fortunately, the shop assistants were awakened by the thick smoke in their dreams. After inspection, they found that the smoke was coming from a cattail bag next to the escalator and extinguished it immediately, preventing a major disaster. After opening the cattail bag, they saw that the contents were cotton soaked in oil, which was obviously arson. Therefore, the shop owner, Xu Huaiyan, questioned everyone in the shop one by one. When he questioned the apprentice Ding Jiuxing (19 years old, from Yangzhou), because his words were hesitant and he saw that Ding's coat was still not taken off, his suspicion was great, so he sent him to the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau. After interrogation, Ding confessed: This sentence was a gift from a sugarcane peddler he asked one day, and now he attaches great importance to it and is continuing the investigation.</p>
<p>Also, at around 12:00 p.m. yesterday, several residents, including Yan Guoliang, in the vicinity of Fukang Branch Road, Nantao Dirt Pond, Yangjia Ferry, Pudong, saw a child holding a box of matches, a glass medicine bottle, and a small bundle of rice straw, which he was lighting, so they stepped forward to twist him and sent him to the police station. According to his confession, his name is Zhang Lixun, ten years old (but according to the reporter's observation, he is at least fifteen years old), from Anhui, living at No. 3 Sanpailou, Nanshi. He came to Pudong to pick up garbage with his sister and brother-in-law and other four people, and was not an arsonist. However, when asked why he was holding rice straw and matches, his words were hesitant and he could not answer everything, only kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy. The Yangjing Sub-bureau and the 8th Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters attach great importance to this case.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Shanghai Vocational Youth Association, in order to arouse citizens' attention to strictly prevent arson by bandits, launched a three-day parade, which was held in the evening.

However, the association was not frightened by it, and Mr. Mao also participated in the parade as usual, with strict precautions all the way, and no accidents occurred. The association also scheduled to continue the parade to Nanshi tonight.</p>

<h3>Case of Jiaotong University Student Crushed to Death: Mayor Urges Reconciliation; Both Parties Negotiate This Morning; Texaco Consultant Surrounded Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] In the case of Jia Zigan, a Jiaotong University student, who was fatally injured by a Texaco Oil Company vehicle on Qimei Road on the 4th of this month, the driver involved has been transferred by the Xinshijie Police Station to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, Wu Shi, the American legal advisor to Texaco, and Zhou Konghuai, the Chinese legal advisor, went to Jiaotong University to discuss the aftermath of the case. They were surrounded and held hostage by dozens of students from the university, who demanded that Li Fuwei, the chairman of Texaco, come to the university in exchange for Wu Shi and Zhou Konghuai. The matter came to the attention of the American Consulate General in Shanghai, and Deputy Consuls Coffin and Lawson went to the Xujiahui branch of the police station at 3:00 PM to seek assistance. The police station dispatched personnel to Jiaotong University to negotiate with Wang Wenchao, the director of student affairs. Wang insisted that Wu Shi and others could only be released after Texaco Chairman Li Fuwei came to the university, stating that the crowd's emotions were high and could not be suppressed. The vehicle they rode to the school, number 50092, had its tires slashed by students from the school and could not be driven. It is understood that Jiaotong University is demanding 635 million yuan in compensation from Texaco for the deceased's bereavement, before the matter can be settled. However, Texaco believes that the case is being investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office and cannot be negotiated privately until a lawsuit is filed and a ruling is made by the District Court. Therefore, both parties remain deadlocked. Yang Anzhong, the director of the Xujiahui branch, reported the situation to Mayor Wu, Deputy Director Yu, and Commander Xuan, who all instructed that the matter be handled cautiously in accordance with the law. Mayor Wu personally went to Jiaotong University at around 7:00 PM to handle the matter, urging Jiaotong University representatives that the matter should be resolved through negotiation. It was agreed that negotiations would be held at the Mayor's Office at 10:00 AM this morning. Jiaotong University will be represented by students Wu Guoding and Liang Gui, while Texaco will be personally represented by Chairman Li Fuwei. At 8:20, Wu Shi and Zhou Konghuai and their vehicle were released by Jiaotong University.</p>
<h3>Food Supply Future Unworrying; Rice Prices in Production Areas Continue to Soar; Chairman Promises Thorough Investigation to Suppress Prices; Authorities Determined to Crack Down on Merchants Disregarding Laws</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, commodity prices in the city showed no signs of decline, and the price of gold and paper money continued to surge sharply, causing anxiety among middle and lower-class citizens. Mayor Wu specially met with reporters yesterday afternoon and made a statement. He believes that suppressing commodity prices remains optimistic. The authorities originally planned to immediately release a large amount of rice, but temporarily suspended sales due to the influx of goods and passengers yesterday. The Mayor pointed out that the rise in rice prices is due to higher prices in production areas. For example, the cost of transporting rice from Changshu to Shanghai is 160,000 yuan, and the price of Wuxi rice delivered to Shanghai is also 141,000 yuan. The Mayor reported this situation to Chairman Chiang yesterday morning, and the Chairman immediately promised to send personnel to the production areas for a thorough investigation, in order to lower rice prices on the spot. Although yarn prices have fluctuated in recent days, when the authorities sent personnel to investigate yesterday, most yarn merchants, fearing interference, immediately suspended business operations. However, the market closure cannot be maintained for long.</p>
<p>The Mayor also stated that the economic emergency measures have had a great effect, but some unscrupulous merchants have become complacent over time, disregarding the law and plotting to stir up trouble and seize opportunities for profit, which is extremely hateful. The authorities are determined to take effective measures to crack down on them and suppress commodity prices. The organization for suppressing commodity prices has been established and will begin investigative actions today. Any illegal acts such as raising commodity prices and privately dealing in gold and paper money will be severely punished in accordance with the economic emergency measures once discovered. When the reporter asked about the Mayor's thoughts on the sentencing of the "foreign tiger" yesterday, he said, "My legal views have no concept of Western or Chinese ethnicity. Anyone who commits a crime should be punished according to the law." The Mayor also hopes that those in the city who engage in black market gold and paper money will take the "foreign tiger" as a warning.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Speculators: Large Numbers of Police Deployed</h3>

<h3>Industrial Association Transports Taiwanese Coal: Sends Personnel to Beijing to Request Approval</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the National Industrial Association stated that the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs only allows 20% of the monthly coal allocation for industrial use in Shanghai, which is far from the actual needs. The black market coal prices are high, and most factories cannot afford it, resulting in more and more factories suspending work. In order to help members solve the coal problem, the association has negotiated with a coal mine company in Taiwan, which has agreed to supply coal. The association has specially dispatched Consul-General Chu He and Qing to Beijing to request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the association to purchase and transport coal directly from Taiwan in accordance with the current actual needs of the factories, so that factories that have stopped work due to the coal shortage can resume work as soon as possible.</p>

The ship will load cargo in Yingkou and sail directly to Shantou. After that, it will run regularly between Shanghai, Shantou, and Guangzhou with Peide. Deng Keng and Yan Guan were originally scheduled to sail the North and South Shipping Line, but the schedule loss was too great, so it was decided to stop. The Shanghai-Yingkou line has little cargo, so it will sail from Shanghai to Qingdao and Tianjin. After arriving in Yingkou, it will sail directly back to Shanghai. The Yuanpei and Qiujin are expected to be repaired and opened around the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Transshipment Matters</p>

However, the Jiang Shun vessel is due for annual repairs, so after the Jiang Xin vessel leaves the dock around the 25th of this month, the Jiang Xin, Jiang An, Jiang Jian, and Jiang Tai will maintain the service. These four ships cannot be spared under any circumstances. The China is temporarily used as an irregular river boat on the Yangtze River line. The Jiang Han vessels require large repairs and haven't been able to complete them yet, now the China Merchants Bureau has completed all adjustments to all the shipping schedules, and it is scheduled to take effect today.</p>
<h3>Gao Feng Dance Hall Manager Suspected of Being a Traitor, On Trial</h3>

<h3>Reader Consultation - Legal Queries</h3>
<p>(1) Refusal to Vacate</p>
<p>Wang Chongxian asks:</p>
<p>(1) Three or four years ago, I rented all the remaining rooms in my house to tenants A and B. Currently, my family has increased in size and the space is insufficient, so I requested A and B to "return the house." Unexpectedly, A and B refused to move out, citing "difficulty in finding a house at present and the need to pay a large tip" as reasons. The "Housing Lease Management Committee" in this city specializes in mediating housing disputes. I don't know what procedures to follow to make a request?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies:] Collecting "tips" is illegal. Using "the need to pay a 'tip' to rent a house elsewhere" as a reason to refuse to move out is not valid. However, the housing shortage in Shanghai is severe and has not been resolved. Therefore, a reasonable date should be determined for vacating the house. Furthermore, the Housing Lease Management Committee was abolished by a resolution of the Municipal Council last year.</p>
<p>(2) Malicious Extortion</p>
<p>Li Zhigan asks: I own a single-room house in a lane, which I rented out five years ago. Now, because the tenant has obtained a Western-style house in the Pudong district and moved there in February of this year, my house has been vacant since then. In fact, the tenant clearly has no need to continue the lease. Moreover, according to the lease, both parties can notify the other party three months in advance to terminate the lease, and it is stipulated that subletting is not allowed. I immediately sent a letter stating that I would take back the house, but the tenant replied, demanding a transfer fee of several taels of gold, claiming that this was due to social custom. I would rather pay rent and leave the house vacant. Therefore, I earnestly request your guidance so that I may follow it.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies:] According to your letter, if the facts are as stated, and the tenant still refuses to move out after formal notification as stipulated in the lease, you can present evidence and sue the tenant in court.</p>

Mr. Qian has completed the revision and printed it into a book. If various circles need it, they can collect it from the guidance department of the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road starting from the 20th.

<h3>Small Football Friendly Tournament - Qingbai Wins Against Xiqing</h3>
<p>The Qingbai Football Team specially formed a small football team to play a friendly match with the Xiqing team from Wuxi at the Nanshi Stadium yesterday. Hong Kong football stars Zhu Yongqiang and He Yingfen specially came out to participate in the war. Zhu and He are known as the kings of small football in Hong Kong, with superb skills and agile feet. More than 2,000 spectators unanimously praised them. Unfortunately, the opponent's strength was poor, and Qingbai failed to exert its strengths. In the first half, Zhu Yongqiang, He Yingfen, and Qu Yongfu, three forwards, each scored a goal with their heads. In the second half, Luo Shoufu rushed to participate in the war and replaced Wu Qixiang. Qu Yongfu served as an inside guard. Qingbai did not do much more. Zhu Yongqiang scored a goal, and the result was four to zero, and Qingbai won.</p>
<p>After the match, the Qunli Small Football Team challenged Qingbai and continued to play an exhibition game. In the first half, Qunli opened the scoring and won 1-0. In the second half, Bai tried his best to counterattack and finally won 4-2. The game raised 2,124,650 yuan, which was donated to the Youth Center for the purchase of equipment.</p>
<h3>National Bank and Citibank Reach Agreement on Cotton Funding: Textile Mills Can Apply to Open Letters of Credit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that in order to actively promote cotton imports, the Central Bank has reached an agreement with Citibank to have Citibank pay the price of 230,000 bales, approximately USD 40 million. All textile mills may apply to Citibank for opening letters of credit (Authority to Purchase) based on the import licenses issued by the Provisional Import Control Commission, so that the bank in New York can accept the cotton draft, allowing foreign exporters to immediately recover their payments. Local textile mills can also follow the procedures announced on March 19 to settle foreign exchange. It is heard that textile mills can consult the designated banks or Citibank in Shanghai for all detailed procedures.</p>
<p>**Imported Goods Not Requiring Foreign Exchange Settlement Still Handled as Usual**</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Commission previously discussed a proposal to allow the import of goods not requiring foreign exchange settlement beyond quota limits under certain conditions. It was decided to organize a foreign exchange source subcommittee meeting to review the foreign exchange sources of each case and grant import licenses if deemed qualified. However, various sectors have many doubts about this matter. This newspaper's reporter interviewed the person in charge of the committee to clarify the truth. It was revealed that this case was sent to Nanjing, and after Director General Zhang Gongquan and Deputy Director General Li Fusun consulted the National Economic Commission, they believed that if this method of using foreign exchange was implemented, unscrupulous merchants would inevitably seize the opportunity to incite legitimate importers, causing them to suffer losses and undermining the government's intention to regulate imports. Therefore, this method will not be implemented, and all imported goods, whether or not they require foreign exchange settlement, will still be handled as usual.</p>
<p>[Additional Report] Related sources stated: After the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Commission passed two principles on the review of foreign exchange sources for imports not requiring foreign exchange at the meeting on the 10th, the outside world, not understanding the truth, even attempted to collude in hoarding US dollars, hoping to replace foreign exchange, causing fluctuations in the exchange rate of US dollars, which is not appropriate. This ultimately led to the rejection of the newly established accommodating measures.</p>

<p>**New Buying Momentum Strong, Many Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up**</p>
<p>Chinese stocks saw new buying interest yesterday, with deliberate attempts to advance, resulting in many new highs and limit-up prices. Although some long positions in the industry were liquidated, most of them returned after selling, leading to frequent reversals after highs.</p>
<p>The market opened high in the morning. After the opening, Jingfu rose to the limit up due to opening prices being much lower than off-exchange prices under mass buying. Xinya also reached the limit up. Numbers 117, 218, 36, 224, 18, and 223 all advanced. Di Yong rose to 3,580 yuan.

Xinhe and Meiya were strongly purchased by Numbers 4, 89, and 152, and the rising trend resumed.

<p>**Unable to Balance Income and Expenditure: Silver Shops Petition the City Government**</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Representatives of the Shanghai silver shop industry, Yao Guilianfang, Yao Qing, and others, totaling five people, submitted petitions to Mayor Wu and Director Wu of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at around 11:00 AM yesterday, stating that the income and expenditure of various silver shops have been difficult to balance in the two weeks since they reopened. They requested that the petition be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, asking for no rigid regulations on the prices of income and expenditure for the industry. At the same time, they requested that the industry be allowed to purchase bullion bars in order to maintain business operations. It is heard that the authorities have agreed to forward the petition.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, various silver shops have temporarily suspended the income and expenditure business of gold jewelry in stores. However, they are still accepting old gold jewelry from customers in exchange for new gold jewelry. In addition, there are only a few transactions in silverware.</p>
<p>According to Yao Lianfang, when speaking to a reporter, the price of gold jewelry sold in stores, including legal profits and operating expenses, is set at 570,000 yuan per liang (ounce). In addition, rough jewelry costs an additional 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per liang for processing, and fine jewelry is priced separately, all as stipulated by the authorities. In the two weeks since the industry reopened, for Qiu Tianbao, which is managed by him, the net amount of expenditure has been nearly 500 liang, while the total amount of income is only 140 to 150 liang. In general, the income of the same industry is roughly two-tenths of the expenditure. The industry is unable to maintain such an imbalance of supply and demand. Therefore, they are forced to request that the authorities set a different method.</p>
<p>**Reasons for Soaring Yarn and Cloth Prices: Thin Inventory and Control by Hot Money**</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the repeated soaring of yarn and cloth prices in recent days, industry insiders analyzed the reasons for the price surge. They said: Aside from the reasons for inflation, the main reasons for the repeated soaring of yarn and cloth prices in recent years are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The inventory of yarn and cloth in Shanghai is not abundant. When the market fluctuates, this small amount of yarn and cloth immediately rises in a straight line once purchased by a large amount of hot money. They said that before the war, the inventory of cotton yarn in Shanghai often maintained around 200,000 bales, and cloth was in the range of 6-7 million pi. Currently, the amount of cotton yarn available for turnover in Shanghai is no more than 120,000 bales, and cloth is no more than 4-500,000 pi. Therefore, yarn and cloth are almost entirely controlled by a large amount of hot money.</p>
<p>(2) The current consumption of military cloth in the country is five times the pre-war figure. (3) Cotton spindles in China are concentrated in coastal areas. The operating time of spindles in coastal areas is now an average of ten hours per day, compared to twelve hours before the war, which is a decrease of 20%. Therefore, even if all spindles in the area are fully operational, the total output is only 80% of the pre-war figure.</p>
<p>They also said that compared to the soaring rates of various major daily necessities, the soaring of yarn and cloth is still moderate. The sale and adjustment of yarn by China Textile Construction Corporation has helped stabilize yarn and cloth prices. However, when the listed price of Textile Construction is too far from the market price, the subsidy of Textile Construction is not discussed, but the market price cannot be suppressed as a result, and direct consumers do not benefit, only allowing intermediaries to make huge profits. Therefore, in this extraordinary period, it is better to adopt a unified distribution, purchase, and sales policy from raw materials to finished products. They believe that this comprehensive plan can integrate the fragmented parts and achieve a reasonable solution to the current situation of separation between yarn and cloth production and sales.</p>
<p>**National Banking Association to Inaugurate Today in Beijing**</p>
<p>The National Banking Association will hold its inaugural meeting at the Beijing Lizhi Society at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Shanghai representatives Li Fusun and Zhao Dihua, among others, took a car to Beijing the day before yesterday. It is heard that the association will discuss the government's issuance of USD treasury bonds at the meeting, and plans to unite national banks to actively promote the fundraising work, hoping that the USD 400 million bonds will be fully raised as soon as possible.</p>
<p>**New Tea Transactions Stable**</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign trade tea market still saw only sporadic small transactions due to buyers taking a wait-and-see approach. In terms of prices, old sellers continued to express their concerns, and new sellers participated in selling off their inventory, so the market continued to be weak. As for domestic sales, tea imports and exports remained balanced, and the market was supported without falling. However, the process of the new Longjing tea produced in Wenhang this year is going downstream, with a sense of obvious decline and hidden stability. The reason for this is that the tea sold by major tea houses in the city a few days ago is all called Mingqian New Longjing, which are the newly sprouted buds of tea trees before the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar, which are made into objects and shipped to Shanghai for market. Therefore, its quality is exceptionally tender, but because the output is limited, the market is regarded as a treasure by the goods side and stands firmly at the peak. Recently, it has reached the edge of the Grain Rain Festival in the lunar calendar, so the goods shipped to Shanghai are almost all Yuqian New Longjing, and its body has gradually aged, and the price has been reduced among peers.</p>
<p>**Nanchang Yarn Prices See Lively Activity**</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report from Nanchang on the 14th] Imported goods in the Nanchang market last week fluctuated with the rising price of the Shanghai market. In particular, the yarn and cloth market was even more lively, with yarn prices rising by about 600,000 yuan in half a month. Today's prices are Shuangma 5.35 million yuan, Lushan 5.1 million yuan, and Shenhu 5.1 million yuan. Ehua also rose by 5-60,000 yuan. Due to poor sales, the export of local products has declined, but grain prices have broken through 10 million in the Gan South and Jiujiang rice markets due to the approaching famine month.</p>
<p>**Cotton Cloth Lacks Spirit**</p>
<p>Quotes for cotton cloth were firm with a hint of weakness, but transactions were still smooth. It is heard that recent sales in the North and Xi'an are still strong, with purchases mainly consisting of raw cloth. The market opened very lively yesterday morning, but speculators are cautious amidst government suppression of prices, and many long positions are sold off, leading to a stable and weak market. Longtou fine cloth secretly quoted over 200,000 yuan, rising to 206,000 yuan, and finally 202,000 yuan, with some transactions. Prices for other Shilin colored cloths were adjusted across the board.</p>
<p>**Allocation of UNRRA Cotton: Subsidy Method to Be Determined**</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs and UNRRA headquarters jointly decided to reduce the price of UNRRA-supplied cotton to 710,000 yuan per dan (50 kg), it was decided that the Textile Control Commission would further subsidize each dan by 60,000 yuan, allocating it to various textile mills for use at a price of 650,000 yuan per dan. However, if the factories calculate the production cost of cotton yarn based on the price of 650,000 yuan per dan of cotton, it will still exceed the current negotiated price for free trading of cotton yarn. As a result of production, it will still lead to losses. In addition, the Textile Control Commission has yet to decide on how to subsidize each factory's UNRRA cotton allocation. Therefore, Director Liu of the Business Department of the Textile Control Commission and Vice Minister Pan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs jointly went to Beijing to discuss a proper solution.</p>
<p>**Tung Oil and Bristle Prices Weak**</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The foreign prices of tung oil and bristles are becoming increasingly weak. Although prices at the origin are rising slowly, the local market remains unchanged. Tung oil shipments continue to arrive, and Chongqing bristles and Hankou bristles are also being shipped to Shanghai one after another, but without strong foreign sales, there is no good prospect in the near future. Yesterday, the market price for full-grade major market was still 380,000 yuan, with no significant increase. Shanghai bristles were 2.7 million yuan, and Chongqing bristles were 3.6 million yuan. Hankou bristles were more popular due to the scarcity of New York Wharf transfers. The Shanghai market price is still stagnant at 4.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>**Guangzhou Import Control Office Supplements Four Measures**</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] In order to strictly manage the issuance of import permits by the Kowloon Office, the Guangzhou Office of the Import Control Commission has supplemented four measures. It stipulates that the Kowloon Office can only issue provisional import permits for nine places: Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Haikou, Zhanjiang, and Kowloon. It also stipulates that, from now on, import permits requested by Hong Kong merchants who have entrusted purchases to registered importers are valid. More than 900 Guangzhou importers have been approved for registration.</p>

<p>**Trials of Japanese War Criminals (Part 1)**</p>
<p>On September 2, 1945, Japan's Instrument of Surrender to the United Nations stipulated that the Emperor and the Japanese government should immediately take appropriate measures to place the Emperor's authority under the control of the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. The Moscow Conference of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on December 6 also made this decision, which was agreed to by the Chinese government, entrusting the authority to handle the Emperor to General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander. The handling of Japanese war criminals is based on this decision. The Instrument of Surrender contains the following three provisions:</p>
<p>(1) An International Military Tribunal for the Far East will be organized to try Japanese war criminals, individually or as members of organizations, or in both capacities, for any violations of the laws of peace or crimes included in such violations.</p>
<p>(2) The organization, jurisdiction, and powers of this Tribunal are specified in the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.</p>
<p>(3) Any existing or future international, domestic, or occupation courts, commissions, or tribunals established in Japan or in the wartime territories of the United Nations to try war criminals are individually subject to jurisdiction and are not bound by any provision of this Charter.</p>
<p>The Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is divided into five parts. (1) The first chapter describes the organizational methods of the Tribunal. The Tribunal is located in Tokyo. Judges are appointed by General MacArthur, initially between five and nine in number, later increased to eleven (new members were from India and the Philippines). A President is selected from the judges and appointed by the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. In addition, there is a Secretary-General and several Deputy Secretaries, clerks, and recorders.</p>
<p>A quorum of more than half of the total number of judges is required for the meeting to be established. The severity or absence of a sentence is determined by a majority vote of the judges present. If the votes are equally divided, the President casts the deciding vote. (2) The second chapter describes the general provisions regarding jurisdiction: war criminals, whether individuals or organizations, fall within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.</p>
<p>Major Japanese war criminals are tried by this Tribunal and punished for their crimes if they are found guilty of (1) violating the laws of peace, (2) violating the laws or customs of war, or (3) committing crimes against humanity. These three categories of crimes are defined as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Crimes against peace refer to planning, preparing, and implementing aggression or war (whether declared or undeclared) in violation of international treaties and agreements.</p>
<p>(B) Violations of the laws and customs of war refer to crimes such as mistreating prisoners of war and civilians in occupied territories, killing protected enemy nationals, plundering property, and wantonly destroying cities or turning them into ruins beyond military necessity.</p>
<p>(C) Crimes against humanity refer to crimes such as killing, exterminating, enslaving, or deporting innocent people before or during war, and mistreating them for political or racial reasons. All other crimes that constitute a war crime, as well as all related crimes, are subject to trial. Whether a person is a planner, conspirator, leader, instigator, or accomplice, they are all subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.</p>
<p>The nations invited to participate in this Tribunal include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, each sending one prosecutor and one judge to form the organization. The prosecutor is appointed by the Supreme Commander of the United Nations and is responsible for all aspects of the prosecution.</p>
<p>In terms of trial procedures, after the criminal facts of a war criminal are established, the Tribunal presents an indictment to the defendant for review. The defendant has the right to defense, may use English or Japanese during the defense, and may freely choose their defense counsel or lawyer. However, the Tribunal may remove the defense counsel at any time. The defendant may present evidence in rebuttal and may question witnesses presented by the prosecutor. However, the defendant must apply in writing for permission from the Tribunal to present rebuttal evidence.</p>
<p>(4) The powers of the Tribunal and the execution of judgments are stipulated as follows: the Tribunal has the following five powers: 1. To summon witnesses to testify; 2. If the defendant refuses to answer questions from the Tribunal, to allow a person related to the defendant to express their views on their behalf; 3. To order the defendant to produce written documents or other evidence; 4. To administer oaths to witnesses in accordance with their national customs; 5. To employ staff as necessary to carry out the Tribunal's business.</p>
<p>(5) The trial procedures must go through the following process: 1. The indictment against each defendant must be read aloud in court; 2. Each defendant must be asked whether they plead guilty; 3. The prosecutor and each defendant must strive for brevity when expressing their views; 4. The admissibility of evidence presented by the prosecutor and each defendant is determined by the Tribunal; 5. The prosecutor and the defendant's defense counsel may question witnesses and the defendants involved; 6. Each defendant's defense counsel may express their views to the Tribunal; 7. The prosecutor may also express their views to the Tribunal. The Tribunal's judgment must be announced in open court.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding judgments and pronouncements, this Tribunal may sentence each defendant found guilty to death or other appropriate punishment. The judgment must be announced in open court and accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for the conviction. The record of the trial must be executed in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. The Supreme Commander of the United Nations may at any time announce a reduction of sentence or modify it under the principle of not increasing the punishment and adopting other forms of punishment.</p>
<p>The International Military Tribunal for the Far East indicted Japanese war criminals on April 29 of last year and began its first hearing on May 3. Hearings continued on June 10. At that time, some argued that the scope of Japanese war criminals should be limited to those since the Pearl Harbor incident, while others argued that it should be limited to those since the July 7 Incident.

<h3>To Suppress the City's Food Prices, the Social Affairs Bureau Decides to First Sell Red Xian Rice; Regulations Stipulate That Participating Rice Businesses Must Provide Strict Guarantees</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai General Grain Warehouse has been ordered to allocate a large quantity of white geng rice, red xian rice, and No. 2 Saigon rice to the municipal government for sale, in order to suppress the city's rice prices. The selling price is three to four thousand yuan lower than the negotiated price. The Social Affairs Bureau has now decided to first sell red xian rice, while the sale of white geng rice will be postponed until all procedures are complete.</p>
<p>Convening Responsible Parties to Discuss Prices</p>
<p>The Grain Section of the bureau specially convened responsible parties from rice businesses and the north and south markets on the previous two days to discuss the details of the selling prices and procedures. Attendees included Yue Xi-chao, Yin Fu-xiang, Hu Wen-an, and Hu Wei-gang, among others. The meeting was chaired by Section Chief Ji. The decisions were: (1) The selling price of red xian rice is 125,500 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). (2) The quantity to be sold will be decided at any time. (3) The deposit for each bag is changed to 12,000 yuan. (4) The retail price at stores is 132,000 yuan per shi. (5) The net weight of 156 hands is equivalent to one shi, not including the bag's weight. Each burlap bag is calculated at 2.4 liang (unit of weight). (6) The market price, including delivery, transportation, and labor commission, is 125,000 yuan per shi. (7) The total amount of payment is changed to 163,000 yuan to be paid in advance for each bag, calculated at 1 shi and 2.5 dou (unit of dry measure).</p>
<p>Signed Statement Guaranteeing No Self-Dealing</p>
<p>In order to prevent rice merchants and businesses from engaging in fraud, the Social Affairs Bureau has specifically modeled the regulations after those for edible oil transactions, stipulating that participating rice businesses must provide guarantees. When signing the guarantee, rice merchants should indicate the business name, address, and the name of the responsible party, stating that the rice purchased will be completely distributed to various rice businesses in the city for actual sales and that they will be responsible for picking up the goods from the warehouse and delivering them to the respective rice businesses, guaranteeing no self-dealing or exceeding the specified prices. When signing the guarantee, rice businesses should indicate the business name, address, the name of the responsible party, and the quantity, stating that the rice will be entirely supplied for retail sales, guaranteeing no adulteration or exceeding the specified prices, and that the selling price will be prominently displayed at the store. Any violations will be subject to severe penalties.</p>
<p>According to Section Chief Ji, the Social Affairs Bureau will decide whether or not to sell based on the quantity of goods received, with 10,000 shi as the standard. If 6,000 shi arrive, 4,000 shi will be sold; if 8,000 shi arrive, 2,000 shi will be sold. Yesterday, over 10,000 shi arrived at the north and south markets, so the Social Affairs Bureau did not sell any, he said.</p>
<h3>Few Transactions, Unified Bonds Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, with floating capital trending towards the stock market, large investors like Shilong and Runde made some settlements. Unified domestic bonds opened at 15,700 yuan, reaching a high of 16,000 yuan before falling to 14,000 yuan and then stabilizing. Transactions totaled less than 5 million yuan. As a result, Classes A, B, and E each fell by 700 to 800 yuan compared to last Saturday, while Class C fell by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate High, Stimulating Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks saw renewed buying pressure from investors due to the high Hong Kong exchange rate. Popular stocks such as Ewo and China Thread, etc., were once priced without a market, indicating an excess of demand over supply. Ewo experienced a sudden and strong surge in the morning, rising from 41,100 yuan, with eager buying, reaching a peak of 43,500 yuan before a large amount of profit-taking emerged, causing a sharp decline and a return. In the afternoon, due to some selling by industry insiders, it continued to decline to within 41,000 yuan. As a result, shipping increased by another 10% compared to last Saturday, while Hopewell and steel each rose by half a percent; the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Banks and Businesses Subscribe to Bonds</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, regarding the subscription of new bonds, various commercial banks and businesses, including Shanghai Steel, Jianye, Guohua, Yongda, Fuli Village, and Anyu Village, subscribed to a total of US$34,010 in short-term treasury bills. The Shanghai Trust Company subscribed to US$7,000 in short-term treasury bills. The Bank of China subscribed to US$33,000 in short-term treasury bills and US$10,600 in US dollar bonds. In addition, the Central Trust Bureau and the Bank of Communications each subscribed to several hundred US dollars in short-term treasury bills.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Market Closes Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, approximately 12,000 shi of rice and grain arrived at the north and south markets. Because prices in the production areas continued to rise, geng rice in the early market continued to increase by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and xian rice also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White yuan, yin yuan, and yanshi were priced up 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. At noon, due to authorities' instructions not to exceed Saturday's market prices, the market closed slightly weak. There was still a large supply of southern geng rice, so fluctuations were minimal.</p>
<p>Flour increased by 1,000 yuan, while imported flour continued to increase by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and bran also increased by 2,000 yuan. Bean cake was selling well, rising first and then leveling out, with prices increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply of soybeans decreased significantly, and demand exceeded supply, causing prices to rise steadily, increasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Southern mung beans, after careful selection, were actively traded, increasing by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Southern red beans were being strongly bought, continuing to soar by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sorghum remained stable, corn remained mediocre, broad beans lacked transactions, raw peanuts were not available, sesame seeds were holding firm, and black sesame seeds, actively traded from Hong Kong, soared by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Emphasizes the Silk and Silkworm Cocoon Purchasing Plan</h3>
<p>Leng Yu-qiu and Chu Fu-cheng paid a special visit to present their case yesterday</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province natives residing in Shanghai, Ling Tong and Chu Fu-cheng, recognizing the impending silkworm season and the fact that this year's silk cocoon purchasing plan has not yet been finalized, which has a significant impact on the rural economy and foreign exchange earnings, took advantage of Chairman Chiang's presence in Shanghai to jointly visit him at Dongping Road yesterday morning. The Chairman personally received them. In addition to outlining the contents and progress of the repeated discussions held by the relevant silk and silkworm agencies and related organizations over the past two months regarding this year's silk cocoon purchasing methods, the two men emphasized the urgency of the situation and the importance of the issue, which could no longer be delayed. They specifically requested that the government promptly finalize measures to protect the capital of silkworm farmers and silk factories, in order to prevent farmers from becoming anxious and to increase foreign exchange income. The Chairman highly valued their opinions and indicated that upon his return to Nanjing, he would urge the Ministries of Agriculture and Economics to promptly submit the matter to the Executive Yuan for discussion and decision.</p>
