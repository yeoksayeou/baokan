<h3>政府亟盼實現和平　願與中共竭誠商談　期能停止衝突改組政府</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕中宣部彭部長於九日下午發表談話稱：自國大圓滿閉幕以後，制憲工作業已完成，建國大計即可依照國大所議決之程序積極進行，政府還政於民之宿志，亦可以如願以償。故政府對於停止衝突及改組政府等問題具體辦法，甚願與中共熱誠商談，以期和平統一能早日實現也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕雷震九日上午七時由滬返抵京，略事休息，即於十時許謁主席報吿在滬與各黨派商談經過，談一時許，旋訪王世杰，當晚十一時乘車赴滬，一二日可重返。據語記者：各黨派參加政府與恢復和談爲兩事，渠在滬時，曾與　隆基，張君勱等數度交換意見。民盟方面主張，先恢復商談，惟無具體方案提出。民社黨方面，內部熊度亦尙未成熟，張君勸下週可能來京。張羣，孫科，或將於星期日歸來。吳鐵城則因攖小疾，將留滬養疴。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日張羣·張君勱曾有會談，內容不詳。惟據民社黨發言人孫寳毅對記者表示：民社黨非絕不參加政府者，但認爲改組政府之前，首應恢復和談，此事固甚困難，但仍盼政府悉力以赴，明白表示議步之限度，使政府求取和平之苦心能大白於天下。國內之亂禍能吿結束，改組政府方有意義。同時政府在改組之前，應先就力之能行者，推行各項改革。例如集會結社之自由，必須充分保陣。孫氏表示，張君勸氏對政府代表提出之意見，當不出以上兩點之範圍。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨左舜生·李璜，民社黨張君勵，伍憲子·萬紉千諸氏，於昨晨九時，相偕訪晤張羣氏，對改組政府等問題，繼續交換意見。二黨定今日舉行聯席會議，擬定一共同之意見，再於明日往訪張　氏，以此項共同之意見為基礎作進一步之商討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕張厲生九日談，渠對馬帥聲明尚未詳加研究，惟認華盼我國和平統上之政策，必始終如一，對華政策不致變更，關於政府改組事，政府盼望甚殷，靑年，民社兩黨之參加，恐僅爲時間憫題，對恢復和談事，如有可能，政府必努力以赴。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕張治中九日午宴新省代表阿合買提江等，晚蔣夢　設宴為張洗塵，雷震·張厲生等作陪。又張治中定十一日舉行記者待會，有所報吿。京市盛傳張將調職中　權，短期內暫不致離京。</p>
<h3>法律配合新憲　半年內可完成　司法行政部正研討中</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕記者頃晤司法行政部刑事司司長楊兆龍，詢以新憲實施法律制度將如何配合之問題，當承答稱：現司法行政部正進行研討下列三事，（一）法律制度如何配合新憲，譬如人民權利與義務問題等，均在計畫中。（二）中國法律制度係自西洋模仿而來，其中有不適合中國國情或與中國傳統觀念相衝突者，目前亦正設法研究，以期有所改良（三）司法行政部現聘美哈佛大學法學敎授龐德氏爲該部顧問，龐氏爲當今名法學專家，前年曾一度訪華，此次業已應聘，啓程之期，將在不遠。又龐氏曾建議中國政府，就中國現行法律，設法完成一有系統之法學巨著，以使右關各方之參考，現此事亦在詳細討論中，關於上述第一二兩項，半年內可吿完成，第三項則大概需時較久。</p>
<h3>憲政實施促進會　為研究考察機關</h3>
<p>幷不負實際上責任</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕洪蘭友談，憲政實施促進會，短期內可望成立，但僅爲研究考察機關，不負實際責任。各省分會亦不至設立，僅中央設常務委會。又聞該會政府代表，將佔六十名，會長可能由吳稚暉出任，副會長三人，將由孫科，及靑年·民社兩黨各任一人，另將設秘書長一人。</p>
<h3>羅隆基評論　馬歇爾聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟發言人羅隆　氏，昨日正式評論馬帥之臨行聲明，贊揚馬帥爲「坦白誠懇的政治家」，其見解有獨到之處，不愧爲中國之「諍友」。但亦有「不能苟同」之處。例如聲明中有謂國民黨訓政結束之言，認爲與「事實不符」。同時馬帥之贊許中國憲法與聯合政府一節，羅氏亦不以爲然，並痛黃政府破壞政協決議。最後認爲馬帥一年來調處工作之失敗，實爲美國對華政策本身有矛盾之故，希望新國務卿能「根據中國人民之願望」，修正今後之對華政策。</p>
<h3>靑年民社兩黨　讚揚馬帥聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕馬歇爾聲明發表後，各黨派咸極重視，靑年黨中常委於昨日下午五時集會，對馬氏聲明作縝密之研討，民社黨中常委對此亦有討論。</p>
<p>據靑年黨宣傳部長左舜生氏發表感想稱：日昨爲歇爾將軍所發表之聲明，我們已細細讀過，充分明了其意義所在，承認其相當深刻並具有正確性。我們前天說過，美國對華政策，容許在技術上有相當修正，但基本精神決不變更，現在看了他這篇聲明的內容，知道我們的看法大致不錯，馬氏留棄一年，對於世界整個局勢，尤其遠東，實已具有充分之了解，而判斷尤為明晰，此次出任國務卿之重任，我們可逆料必有所成就。本人在政協開會以前，曾以靑年黨當時所擬定之方案，與馬氏交換意見，政協能得到相當成功，實得力於馬氏情神上之支援不少，馬氏在此次聲明中強調希望吾人實現此一部依據政協原則之民主憲法，更可見馬氏前後之看法實屬一貫，允令吾人感到欣慰。</p>
<p>民社然發言人孫寳設氏稱：馬歇爾聲明無疑是聲治中國病狀最好的診斷書，它指出政協決議原可作爲和平建國的基礎，此項基礎已因國共二黨一部份人士的阻撓，與猜疑而吿垮台，和平建國的一綫希望，端在二黨溫和份子與其他開明份子的抬頭，此項認識，相當準確，民社滅一向主張，民主政治決對實現民主政治積極努力不稍落後。</p>
<h3>蔣夫人來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕蔣夫人九日十二時乘美齡號飛滬，內可返京。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣夫人宋美齡女士，昨日下午十二時五十分偕黃總幹事及隨員等由京飛滬。聞夫人此來純係私事，將在此逗留四五日後即返。</p>
<h3>白部長談話　否認將主新疆</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕近傳白崇禧將長新疆，記者特以此事叩訪，將軍以極簡截之語句吿記者稱；「絕無此事。」</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日常〕白崇禧日昨曾接見陳納德。</p>
<h3>民盟政治報告　即將公開發表</h3>
<p>昨曾加以詳細研討</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟二中全會昨日續開，上午由鄧初民任主席，討論財務事項，決定「盟員養盟」之原則，並即成立籌募基金委員會，大規模募集基金。此外另有議決兩項：（一）各支部報吿，各地盟貫之自由常受限制，民盟將向政府提出總抗議。（二）民盟將制定盟歌及盟徽，由中常會提交第二决全國代表大會通過，下午繼續開會，由張東蓀主席，全部時間用以討論長達一萬五千言之政治報吿，內容暫守秘密，候將來召開記者招待會時發表。今日會議中，聞將討諭人事問題。</p>
<h3>滕納哲抵靑　視察美戰隊</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島九日電〕美海軍陸戰隊太平洋區司令官滕納哲中將，偕陸戰隊第一師司令霍華德少將，九日上午十時自珍珠港乘專機抵靑，與柯克上將會晤，視察在靑美海軍，並參觀中央海軍訓練團，晚赴靑備備司令丁治磐招待會，定十日飛津，繼續視察平津美海軍陸戰隊。</p>
<h3>調整軍人待遇　增加津貼數額與公務員相等　已呈請最高當局核示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕國防部主管機關對軍人待遇調整事，曾擬有兩方案：（一）全國軍人特遇按補給區給與，迪化區增加百分之百，京滬區百分之八十，鄭州，開封百分之六十，武漢區百分之四十，重慶及滇康區百分之廿。（二）此項新待遇調整，除蒙古·台灣·新疆三地以幣値比例懸殊，不按補給區給與外，其餘全國各地其增加率均爲一律，並不加薪，而增加其津貼，增加數額與公敎人員待遇相等，並發實物，聞已由該部轉呈最高當局核示。又全國官兵副食費三十五年度爲七千五百元，且有部分發給實物，茲以物價飛漲，而辦現實物尤多不便，當局已改發副食費一萬五千元，並自三十六年一月份起實行。</p>
<h3>熊式輝由瀋抵平　明日晉京報告東北情形　接收大連事即進行交涉</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽九日電〕熊式輝九日午十一時偕行轅辦公室主任許鵬飛，第二處長關邦傑，秘書劉汀乘專機飛平，日內轉京謁主席，報吿東北軍政情形，並請示方針，對東北外交，亦將陳述意見。此間人士多期待熊氏歸來對東北有新興革。熊氏離瀋期間，由參謀長董英斌主持一切。</p>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕熊式輝九日下午一時半自潘飛抵平，下午四時熊氏訪李宗仁，晚七時宴自京歸來東北國大代表，據其左右稱：熊擬勾留一日，十一日即飛京述職。熊氏對記者否認梁華盛辭職說，並稱：東北行轅改組後，已縮減至八處，人員亦僅剩原來三分之一。</p>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕接收大連交涉，仍待展開，熊式輝今日對記者稱：接收大連事，政府尙未。據悉：大連附近國共兩軍仍在普蘭店對峙中，安東方面之中蘇外交接觸若斷若績，東北外交特派員公署近曾派第二科長徐立羣到安東，擬與北鮮蘇軍當局洽商水豐發電廠主權，鴨綠江通航，劃界等問題，迄無結果。蔣經國最近曾作東北之行，最近並將再赴東北，似與東北外交有關。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕東北行轅駐京辦事處息，熊式輝九日下午一時半由瀋飛平，抵平後與當地軍政首長會商要公，日兩即來京。又東北行轅平辦事處主任盛紫莊及行轅第一處處長戴　忠，已於數日前抵京，分訪行政院及國防部等機關。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽九日電〕記者在大連外圍作數日之巡視，在軍事方面得知國軍已停止在大連市區邊緣活動，正以大部力量在普蘭店至貔子窟公路綫以北迄岫坑地區作肅淸共軍工作，自石河以南至旅大，約有蘇軍十餘萬，共軍亦夥。</p>
<h3>馬使所提忠告　吾宜靜心檢討</h3>
<p>邵力子發表談話　〔本報南京九日電〕邵力子九日晨就馬帥聲明發表談話稱：馬帥離華後，吾人允應竭盡忠誠爲和平民主而努力，以完成和平繁榮之宿願。馬帥所提忠吿，吾人宜靜心檢討，並虛心接受。</p>
<h3>顧祝同請辭簡職　胡宗南將調鄭綏署主任</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕陸軍總司令顧祝同氏兼鄭州綏靖公署主任以來，於茲四月，茲以陸總部將擴大，而部務繁忙，無暇兼顧，已簽呈主席懇辭兼職，聞主席已予俯准，遺鄭州綏靖主任職，將以胡畏官宗南調任。又胡氏就綏署主任後，即與一戰區長官部合併，一戰區長官部即行撤銷。</p>
<h3>國大選舉事務所　本年四月間成立　辦理國大代表選舉事宜</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕政府將於四月問設立國大選舉事務所，辦理代表選舉事宜。又國大祕秘書處，日來正趕辦結束，過渡時期中，該處業務或將交由內政部辦理</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕國大秘書處負責人頃稱，一月五日靑島失事飛機，罹難乘客中有李潤紳者，近日外傳李係國大代表，且謂渠此次出席大會，係由丁佑民其人者代替，故罹難者，實係冒充國大代表李潤紳之丁佑民云云。查本會所有紀錄，李潤紳原係國大代表，惟此次大會開會前，秘書處會准國大選舉總事務所通知，李因有案未結，應暫不予以報到，故自大會開幕以迄閉幕，李潤紳從未出席，外傳各節，顯有與事實不符之處。</p>

<h3>國防部發表聲明　闡明中共軍隊求戰用心</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕國防部軍事發言人發表聲明稱：自歷次停戰命令頒發以來，不論因中共軍隊攻擊國軍而引起戰事之事實演變如何，不論雙方作載之成果如何，本部從未發表任何戰報或策動宣傳，演染本身之勝利與誇大共軍之損失，因政府爲興建國家，調甦民困，不惜以百般忍讓，委曲求全，其希求和平之意旨，實無限殷切，故對於黨派裂痕，內爭血跡，不論誰勝誰敗，均以爲可羞而痛心，不忍淺加宣揚，更不忍引同胞之創傷爲快事。但自抗戰勝利以來，中共方面竟不以內戰爲可恥，反鼓譟宣傳，盡軍事上揑造誇張之能事，足徵共方在政治上毫無尋求和平之誠意，在宣傳上別有不測之用心。近自國大開會以來，共方更一再誇張戰果，揑造國軍損失，集其傷亡報道，國軍早已一兵無存。又如昨日中共發表魯南之戰報，內列有殲滅國軍（中央直屬交通兵第四團全部），事實上國車從來無此番號。又稱（俘虜旅長車藩如），而車氏現充本部參謀總長辦公室副主任，今尙見其安然來部辦公，復稱：此役斃傷俘國軍兩萬七千餘人，是則該區國軍已全部無存、計日共軍應作佔領徐州之慶　爲何今猶掙扎於魯南泥沼中，姍姍其來遲耶？以上僅舉敷端，　發共軍歷來戰報之實質，正視聽，　眞僞，闡明其蓄爭氣氛，以後對於各地不和諧事件，除引為無上之遺憾外，仍不發表戰報。</p>

<h3>聯總待運中國物資　價值逾二億美元　魯克斯報告將加緊運送</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕聯總署長魯克斯少將，今日發表報吿，謂截至一月一日爲止，聯總輸出之物資已達一九·二五七·九七〇噸，約値二·二八一·七五九·〇〇〇美元，完成全部計劃百份之七十八。爲使聯總早日結束起見，將在短期內輸出所餘之六百萬噸（約値六六一·九四九·〇〇〇美元）之物資。在比未運出之物次中，中國將獲此價二六九·一一九·〇〇〇美元，菲列濱四·五二五·〇〇〇美元，朝鮮八二二·〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>關於中國部份，魯克斯稱：『在我人所未運出之物資中，百份四十將運往中國，因對華之物資運送，現僅完成一半也。我人在華之工作，其開始也，較歐洲方面略遲數月。此外，中國碼頭之擁擠，迫使我人中止運送（食糧除外），此亦爲延遲原因之一。七月間所實施之步驟，甚收効果，大部份物資之禁運，均經解除，現所未運出者，僅限於不易分配之物品而已。我人以二百餘艘登陸艇及其他船隻供給中國當局，分配工作遂趨順利。現我人將繼續以六十艘船隻供給中國。</p>
<p>在開始之時，聯總在中國方面之工作，即極困難，其原因不外乎地區之遼闊，交通之困難及中國本身行政問題。聯總物資之分配，一視同仁，絕不容許種族及政治觀念之歧視。爲遵照此項政策，聯總力圖以公允比例之物資運往共產區。但因內戰關係，此種努力未能獲得効果。聯總現正加倍努力，盼與國共成立協議，俾以大量物資運往共產區，據最近之報吿，此項努力，已獲相當之成功。</p>

<h3>對馬帥任國務卿的期望</h3>
<p>爲歇爾元帥返國出任國務卿的消息，一經傳出之後，就獲得中美朝野的好評；美國參議院也已於八日全體一致予以批准，竟無一人表示異議，在美國政治史上殆爲罕有的現象，新任參議院議長范登堡暨前任參議院外交委員會主席康奈萊，均曾與貝爾納斯共同擬就美國兩黨一致之外交政策，對於貝爾納斯一年半以來的勞績，無不稱這備至；但對於馬帥的出任國務卿，也莫不認爲最適當的人選。美國時代雜誌稱頌貝氏爲一九四六年的偉人，馬帥實爲美國近代史上之眞正的偉大人物。馬帥在中國未能達成其任務而不得不離華斷國出任國務卿，固然是一件殊可扼腕的事情，但此非馬帥不再過問中國政治之謂，而且我們認爲，在馬帥出任國務卿之後，對於其在中國未竟之偉業，更有加速完成的希望。</p>
<p>馬帥奉杜魯門總統之命，出使中國，調處國共衝突，迄今恰是整整的十一個月，在其期間，馬帥曾不斷與各方面接觸，並默察中國暨遠東局勢的演進，不僅深知中國的政情以及全國四億五千萬人民的共同願望，而且也洞悉遠東局勢的癓結何在。以共超人的智慧及其百戰百勝的韜略，調處國共衝突，竟未能達成其任務，使中國獲致和平，當不能認爲馬帥個人的失敗。我們研究中國內亂不止的原因，實在不一而足，馬帥離華之前向美國國務院提出的備忘錄，固已詳言之矣；但是我們始終認爲中國問題的性質並不單純，而是一側關係非常複雜而微妙的問題，僅以總統特使的權限欲謀得中國問題的解決，不免輒有所窮，而不能統盤籌劃，謀得根本的解決。但至馬帥出任國務卿後美國的對外政策，將完全受其支配，馬帥必能運用自如，對於中國問題的解決，必有許多便利的地方。馬帥本人雖不在中國，但有司徒大使在華，仍能繼續調處工作；外界盛傳司徒大使即將吿退，我們絕不置信，因爲司徒大使的出使中國，係馬帥向總統推　的結果，其主要任務，乃在協助罵帥進行調處的工作，對於馬帥認識中國，曾有莫大的貢獻，而今馬帥旣仍欲解決中國問題，自不能缺少司徒大使的襄助，而是唯有一人在美主特大政方針，一人在華調處國共衝突，始有獲得成功的希望。</p>
<p>我們始終認爲中國問題，是遠東問題的一環，遠東局勢的明朗，對於中國問題的解決，必有莫大的裨益。我們回顧與前瞻，不難證明：自從紐約四國外長會議與第二屆聯合國大會相繼閉幕以來，歐洲國際政治已獲得了一個平靜的歸趨，在英美蘇三國之間，也有了好轉的徵兆；但是遠東局勢尙未明朗，美蘇關係的改善還沒有具體化。世人的視綫，均將集中於今年三月間的莫斯科四國外長會議，莫不懷着絕大的希望。英國陸軍參謀長蒙特戈梅萊元即現正在莫斯科訪問蘇聯軍政界要人，英蘇間的空氣已大見緩和，前工黨主席拉斯基敎授，訪蘇歸國，也宣稱蘇聯確有和平的意向，準此而論，英蘇兩國間的猜疑，不難煥然冰釋。此在美蘇之間，社魯門總統在其致第八十屆國會的咨文中，也以美蘇合作爲言，至馬帥國務卿就職之後，自當秉承總統之意志，設法擴大紐約四國外長會議及第二屆聯合國大會所獲的成就，謀得美蘇關係的好轉。我們猶記得在大戰期間，馬部以美國參謀總長的資格，與蘇聯軍政要人，接觸頻繁，當英美蘇三國互頭在波茨坦舉行會議時，馬帥曾親自與史丹林元帥晤談，所以憑馬帥過去的經騐及其對蘇聯的感情，自不難改善美蘇兩國間的邦交。何况馬帥在華時，默察遠東局勢的核心問題，無時不注意蘇聯的動向，所謂「知己知彼，百戰百勝」，向爲馬帥所時長。是以吾人相信，馬帥就職後在外交上所採取的第一步驟，必為設法改善美蘇蘭係。</p>
<p>至於美國的對華政策，不致有重大的變化，惟因馬帥深知中國的國情，洞悉全國人民的願望，並且非常了解目下中國最迫切需要究底是什麼？質言之。不外乎「和平·統一·民主·建國」八個大字，「和平統一」，尙待各方面的努力爭取，而「民主建國」，則已踏出其第一大步，一部切實可行的民主憲法，業經國民大會通過，並由政府明令公佈，將於本年十二月二十五日起實施，目下雖仍在實施憲政的前夕，但國民黨的訓政時期，當可目爲已成過去，而且擴大政府基礎，羅致各黨派代表及社會賢達參加，不久就可以實現。美國如欲協助中國建國復興，則在物質上予以積極的援助，此其時矣。</p>
<p>馬帥在其致國務院的備忘錄之中，也曾設明中國經濟情形，受了共產黨的破壞，已陷於十分嚴重的境地。美國若在此時予以物質的援助，自必能事半功倍。中國目下最急需的，一爲全國交通的恢復，另爲工商業的振興，而此二端的完成，實有賴友邦的協助，所以我們希望美國當局，不必一定要等待和平眞正恢復之後。在此際即能援助中國，向着建國的坦途邁進。我們所抱着的這種心情，諒必爲馬帥所能體會得到的。</p>
<p>要之，馬帥歸國就職之後，美國外交政策的重點，必將集中於遠東，我們希望馬帥高瞻遠矚，一方面改善美蘇邦交，恢復戰時互信互助的精神，共同致力於和平的締造，俾使遠東局勢亦能隨將明朗；另一方面積極援助中國以奠定中國民主建國的始基。這樣雙管齊下，必能謀得中國問題的根本解決，以達成馬帥在華未竟的偉業。</p>
<h3>如何整頓人事</h3>
<p>人事行政是現在最令人難以滿意的問題之一。競大體說來，其弱點有四；一·爲員額太多，二，爲一般水準太低，三，爲待遇太薄，四，爲流動性太大，五，爲效率太差。而此等弱點，大都又互爲因果。因爲待遇太薄，找不到適當人才，所以水準便低。因爲水準旣低，所以效率便差，員額不能不多。因爲效率旣差，不能不時時調整，所以流動性大，在職人員毫無保障。</p>
<p>其　結所在，自然應以待遇太薄，與職位太無保障為最要關鍵。不過除掉這兩種原因以外，還有許多客觀的條件，足以促成人事上的龐雜與紛亂。其一為過重形式。譬如說：要推行某一制度，就一問實際情形如何，硬要整齊剷一，一律推行以求貫澈。據設某某一個機構。連主任，連屬員，攏總不過兩個職員，但是因爲牠也算是一個機構，照例也須由會計機關派一名會計員。軍興以前，某縣的建設經費，其總歡不過一萬餘元，却也要設立一個建設局，照此辦法，冗員怎能不多？員額怎能不廣：</p>
<p>其二爲花樣太多。只要是名目新穎，合於時代，就不管財政上的條件爲何，便會一律搬出來。倘有持異議的，便加他一個破壞或摧殘的罪名，使他無話可說。所以大街小巷，乃至鄕村僻壤，各式各樣的牌子，到處可見。當然，這其中，有許多單是半　半飽，養着幾個閒員的，其實也不在少數。</p>
<p>其三，爲主管和命令機關太多。各就各的職掌，各顧各的塲面，分道揚鑣，亂發命令，以表示他們的努力，下級機關，以地位關係，又不敢不遵照辦理。於是牌子愈多，用人也愈多。至於經費有沒有着落，辦理的成績如何，那另是一回事。好得造幾張表册，報幾個數目字，總不會沒有辦法的。有人以爲現在各機關皆有中心工作，這種情形，應該可以改善些。却不知那些主管機關，又各各把牠的主管事項，令飭列人中心工作了。我們知道，有許多地方，其財政雖名爲統收統支，實則此疆彼界，界限井然，凡是指定買鹽的錢，斷不許他買油。所謂中心工作，不過在辦理時特別注重些，事實上，能統盤籌畫，權衡緩急的，的確還不易多見，因而駢枝機關和冗員，也還是無法裁减的。</p>
<p>所以眞要裁减冗員，汰除靡費，我們認爲第一，要當地的主管長官，把握得住全局，用主觀來分別緩急，制定適宜的行政方針，不可隨便應付，造成亂七八嘈的局面。第二，各機關的員額和謝給，要有相當的伸縮性，使各該主持人員可以斟酌情形，爲實際上適當的處覺，萬不可依樣葫蘆，過於板滯，使可用的人不能用，而木必用的人不能不用。我們相信：這是整頓人事的必要途徑。</p>
<h3>國際糧會分配食米　我獲廿四萬餘噸　僅為要求數之百分之三十五</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓八日電〕國際緊急糧食會議，今日分配中國一九四七年上半年之米二十四萬五千公噸，此數僅爲中國所要求數八十萬噸之百分之卅五。該會議謂：該時期之中，米之供應量，僅足敷各國請求者及各急需國家之百分之卅五。中國出席該會議之代表陳之邁宣稱：分配中國之米，其中十萬噸取自暹羅，三十三萬噸取自越南，十萬噸取自緬甸，一萬二千噸取自美國。該會議又准許暹羅之中國米商繼續運米往中國，其在總額中分配之百分數如次：自去年十月起，從　羅運出之米如超過五萬噸時。則分配百分之五，超過六萬噸時，則百分之六，超過八萬噸時則百分之七，超過十萬噸時則百分之八。陳之遇謂：中國于開始最初三個月內，可另獲得米二萬四千噸，係由英國償還者，于此六個月中，中國可分配得大量麥與麵粉。</p>

<p>我是一個市立中心小學的敎師，月人薪二十萬元，要瞻義一家五口，我上有白髮婆娑的老母，下看年纔髫齡的孩子，平時的開支多半是去向親友處移借，或是變賣家中破敗的什物來捱過。現在天氣冷了，早上起來，屋瓦上的霜已加厚了不少，可是我們身上仍是這幾件單薄破敗的老棉衣，家中什物已變賣罊盡，親友處也無顏再上門去移借，母親因受了風寒，染上咳嗽，孩子也為了寒冷，終日蜷縮在牀上；當我聽到了母親的咳嗽聲，看到孩子們發抖的樣子，光生！人心都是肉做的，我哪得不心痛呢？</p>
<p>我知道市府當局也有他的苦衷，但是我是一個窮敎員，我並沒有什麽過奢的慾望，我只求當局讓我們窮敎員能够過冬，（一小學校師）</p>
<p>弄堂橡膠廠可憂慮</p>
<p>鄙人居住滬西膠州路五十一弄，貼鄰為一小型橡膠廠，隆隆機聲，澈夜不休，擾人淸睡，莫此為甚。因念尙有更甚於此者，為橡膠物品極易引火，不久前報載潘家庫莘　橡膠廠因比鄰失火，延燒達數小時，不易撲滅，幸地處僻野，昆連甚少，傷害尙微。査里衛中之開設工廠，原為當局所不許，而今最易引火之像膠廠，設立於住戶密運地位狹仄之里街中，値此隆冬設或一旦不幸，層樓疊擱之居戶，其未來之慘狀，實不堪想像。事關公衆安全，鄙人身歷其境，心所謂危，不敢緘默，幸當局注意及之，勿謂言之不早也。（庸）</p>

<h3>馬歇爾繼任國務卿　美參議院一致批准　締造世界和平完成貝爾納斯未竟之功　對蘇外交保持「堅定」原則</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕美參院今日一致通過馬歇爾元帥任國務卿一職，席間范登　參議員對馬帥及貝爾納斯均加以讚揚，並謂參院應迅速採取行動，以便告示全世界曰：「美外交政策之團結綱續不變」。新任國務卿就職之期尙未決定，但在馬帥未返抵美國前，貝氏恐將暫時留任。貝氏辭職雖引起若干方面之驚異，但其因體力不濟而求去之意，則早為一般人所熟知，貝氏之米學引退者，乃欲完成對五個附庸國之和約耳。貝氏辭職之消息，原定數日後始發表，但因消息業巳洩漏，故特提前宣佈。據白富新聞秘書羅斯稱：在數月前馬帥與貝氏即巳獲得諒解，在員氏辭職後，馬帥即機任。觀察家認為國務鄉之易人，決不影響貝氏所追隨之筆國兩黨政策。</p>
<p>〔節合社華盛頓八日電〕馬帥調任美國務卿，自必繼續准行貝爾納斯之外交政策無疑，對蘇聯亦必保持己往之「堅定」方針。外交及國會方面領袖一致認為馬帥將繼續締造世界和平，以完成員爾納斯米竟之功，馬歇爾第一項巨大任務，將為利用此後數星期之時間加緊工作，以備三月間出席莫斯科外長會議，商談德奧和約。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓九日電〕此間外交界人士相信貝爾納斯辭職之原因，殆為美國將改變其對蘇政策，但美國外交政策仍不致放棄其「審愼與堅定」之基本原則，亦不致更趨強硬或精微。本質不變，僅將在程度上稍有修改。傳貝爾納斯曾以為倘能繼續維持已黎會議時之制度，則美蘇二國意見之基本歧與，終能逐漸消滅，貝氏對此進退有方，常以外交上之迤延戰略，以期逐步到達美國之目的。聞馬歇爾今將另換方法，使雙方攤牌，幷由明放棄貝爾納斯所採取之「針刺」第略。據此間觀察家談稱，莫斯科會議雖僅有總國和約一項議售，但馬歇爾屆時倘提出廣泛檢討美蘇二國之關係，蘇聯當亦不致拒絕，但在此時猜測其能否產生具體結果則尚嫌過早</p>
<h3>國務院內部人事　將有大規模更動　粉紅色分子將被淸除</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕馬歇爾正式繼貝爾納斯就任國務卿後，國務院高級人員以及美國駐外交代表，將有大親模之更勤。傳馬歇爾將軍有派前駐華美軍司令魏德邁二級上將，任駐華大使以代司徒雷登之意。國務院高級人員之將辭職者，有副國務卿艾克每，羅斯福總統之智囊貝爾納斯參預和的談判之顧間高恩，負責美國國際宣傳之班登等。若干觀察家皆謂貝爾納斯離華盛頓過久，故國務院內部之組織已形鬆懈，馬歇頭就職後當澈底整頓，剔除其有共產及極左色彩之人，而軍人之踏入外交界者預料將較前更多。關於肅淸親共及　左份子一點。共和黨控制之議會固已早有此項呼聲，至於馬歇爾今後所將面臨之問題，除關於四强談判之各項率務外，有關軍事外交方面者尙有西半球之聯防公約與英國及他國之軍備標準化計劉及美國長期佔用太平洋內前屬日本之島嶼</p>
<h3>美陸長廣播　日已無侵美可能</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關金山九日廣播：美陸長柏德遜今日在特別廣播中，鄭重言明日本已無海陸空軍，決無再度進攻美國之可能，渠並指出美國亟盼自蘇聯及蘇聯控制區加速遣送日人返國，俾彼等可有機會學習民主，使其本國早日自供自足。</p>
<h3>馬帥出掌國務院　歐洲各國反響</h3>
<p>〔聯公社倫敦八日電〕美國務鄉貝爾納斯辭職，歐洲各國反響，可以驚異附帶惋惜情緒概括之，至於馬歇爾之繼其任，則一致表示讚美。英外部發言人對於馬帥主持美國外交，無條件表示贊同。莫斯科尙守緘默，惟柏林方面蘇聯控制報紙則調馬帥將與蘇聯更密切合作。歐洲若干報紙以為馬帥調任美國務卿，足見美國注意遠東局勢。倫敦外交觀察家則謂，蘇聯反響殆必以馬帥調解中國國共紛爭成績為轉移。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓八日電〕又此間外交界人　對於馬帥日後之對蘇態度，均拒不加以揣測，僅謂馬帥在戰時曾與史達林暨蘇聯其他高級將領私交均深，英美蘇三巨頭於一九四五年在波茨坦舉行會議時，史達林曾以簽名冊袖交馬帥，請其親筆簽名以留紀念，伏羅希洛夫及巨哥夫亦會以蘇聯土產魚子醫及伏特加酒等珍品　贈馬帥。</p>
<h3>外長會議　不致延期</h3>
<p>蘇當局保證新聞自由</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓九日電）美國務院某發言人今日談稱：四外長會議定三月間在莫斯科舉行，從未考慮延期舉行。馬歇爾元帥之出任國務卿，不致使會議延擱。同時貝爾納斯將　擴執行國務鄉職務，以待馬歇爾之接事。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約八日電〕莫斯科合衆社據編輯廉里斯堡來電稱：蘇聯巳保證三月間在莫斯科舉行四國外長會議時，可廣得新聞報道自由，準此而論，則談聯之新聞政策，當將予以極大修改。</p>
<h3>杜魯門向國會提出經濟報告　總統語氣頗為樂觀</h3>
<p>〔聯台社華盛頓八日電〕社魯門總統今日向國會提出經謂：美國如不能踐約，减，則於世界政治與樹立持之希望，將有遠大之影響有最大之生產，就業與解買力，故不　外國競爭，惟當推進計劃，獲致相互的减低貿易壁壘。美國發起組織之國際貿易機構，乃為在健全基礎上重建大規模國外貿易之最重大步驟。但其他多數國家是否樂於加入此種機構，大部份繫於今年互惠關稅談判中吾人之態度。政政府巳有權力削减現行關稅率百分之五十，不必徽求國會同意。</p>
<p>國際討論減低關稅</p>
<p>美國巳邀請其他十八國於今年四月在日內瓦舉行會議，討論同樣减低關稅及消減其他貿易限制。吾人對於置國際經濟關係於健全的基礎之上，若不能克盡　責，則一部份國家似將盛覺被迫增加其本身之控制，此種發展勢必將全世界分裂成各個貿易集團。保持一九四七年美國之繁榮，唯有維持現行稅則，提高最低工資，增進社會福利，及維持房租管理。削減戰時所得稅實非健全的財政政策。眞正購買力與生產能力之平衡，務必經由减低物價之方法。</p>
<p>賦稅維持現行標準</p>
<p>賦稅應保持現行標準，健全的公共財政，需要在就業衆多與全部收入巨大之時，國庫收入超過支出。賦稅負担重大，一俟可能即當減輕，但將來減低之時，務求其公正與平等分配。</p>
<p>總統長篇報告開頭時語氣樂觀，謂一九四七年開始，美國之強盛與繁榮，為從來未有，吾人之希望，亦從無如此明朗。美國人民應排斥再來一次蕭條之想像。</p>
<h3>蘇總參謀長　將分訪英美</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播：穌聯海陸空軍總司令伐西勒夫斯　巳接受美國艾森豪華參謀長及英國蒙哥馬利元帥之邀，在短期赴英美視察兩國之軍事設備。</p>
<h3>菲國將成立　國防委員會</h3>
<p>羅哈期總統自任主席</p>
<p>〔聯台社馬尼刺八日電〕羅哈斯總統即將頒佈侖令，設立國防委員會，自任主席，制定菲律濱全面國防政策，租與美國基地問題亦在其丙。美國大使麥克納與菲律濱副總統兼外長奧里諾所可成立之任何協定，當由國防委員會檢討，然後以條約方式提出菲律濱參議院討論。美國駐菲律濱軍事顧問瓊斯及菲律濱參謀次長社克正在草擬十年國防計劃，以應付戰爭之最新發展及原子時代戰略。</p>
<h3>越局依然緊張　法徴新兵入伍　慕臺主張政軍雙管齊下</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕國防部今日發表公報稱：法國國防單軍官，下級軍官與士兵，或將派往遠東，比乃遠東局勢發展使然。同時國防軍志願兵徵召年齡，自十九歲减至十八歲，往遠東服務之一般志願軍徵召條例，亦巳修改，以便黴募一大批有經騐之壯丁入伍。此外參戰軍人兩營今日自泰信港開往越南，不稍躭擱。</p>
<p>〔路透社加爾各答八日電〕法海外殖民部長慕台目越南返國，今日抵達此間。渠擬赴加爾各答及麻特拉斯附近之西法國殖民地視察。慕氏謂越南問題不能僅憑軍事力量解決之。俟維明方面了解必須由雙方忠實執行法維前此所訂之協定時，政治局勢即可解決。法國政策迄無變更。吾人仍擬維持維明自治政府及交趾支那自治政府云。</p>
<p>〔路透社河內八日電〕該處之中·英·美領事，今日步行致維軍防綫內，要求保證被押作質之法國平民二百人之安全，結果如何猶未悉。又聞維明方面巳有恢復政治活動之意，如能恢復談判，彼等即可停止軍事活動。</p>
<p>〔聯合社河內九日電〕聯合社收聽越南人民共和國電台昨夜廣播，有抵抗到底以至「自殺」等言。越人領袖胡志明廣播演說稱：「吾人之抵抗，獲得成功時，即可開杯暢飲。」</p>
<h3>外約但國王　冒雪抵土京</h3>
<p>〔聯合社安加拉八日電〕外的但國王阿白杜拉今日於大雪中乘士耳其總統專車到此，歡迎儀式甚盛。</p>
<h3>美參衆兩院聯會席上　杜魯門演詞全文（下）</h3>
<p>限制獨佔</p>
<p>我歡竟在諸位之前討論的第二項靈大問題，乃是倉關經濟權力逐漸集中進而威脅到私人企業自由競爭的問題。當一九四一年，臨時全國經濟委員曾完成一次對於全國經濟工作的綜合調査，根據該委員會的研究，發現儘管一世紀以來實施蘧反托辣斯法，而事實上威脅我們福利程度最危險乃是權力加速集中在少數且型組織的手中。</p>
<p>在歡時，這種久巳存在的經濟集中趨勢更外加快，其結果，就使我們現在發現全部工業受統制於少數組織的程度遠甚往昔。利這些少數的巨型組織可以為了更高的潤血限制生產。因此就减少了雇工人數與人們的購買力。</p>
<p>為了努力保證商萊可獲全部自由競爭的機會，我們將努力實施反托辣斯法，國會在合作協助這種法案方面可以盡力之處是很多的。</p>
<p>單是加强執行管理商業習慣的法律還不够。在執行之外必須加以協助新企業的積極措施。政府的協助，研究的計劃和貸款的權力，應當用來促進新商行和新工業的生長。協助小商業在這個時候尤其重要。我們也應當特別注意工業的分化和工業化區域的發展。</p>
<p>房屋問題</p>
<p>第三個重大政策對於全國經濟也是很重要的—那就是積極鼓勵造屋的計劃。聯邦第一個綏和退伍軍人的屋荒的計劃已於一九四六年二月宣佈在案。一九四六年一百萬家庭房屋的單位巳在建設中，另六十六萬五千個單位巳吿完成。建議方面擴張的速率巳打破一切紀錄。</p>
<p>在未來一年內房屋單位的數目即使不超過，也將近乎一九四六年的最高建築年。以合理的代償把房屋交付退伍軍人，這個責任在於私人的工業和勞工。政府將繼續加速重要建築材料的流通，限制非住宅的建築，並供給財政上的協助。刺激出租的房屋和新型房屋的建築，將得到特別的重視。</p>
<p>為達到人人都有房屎可住的目標的永遠計劃，急需關於房屋的立法，類似去年國會所通過的非政黨議案。至少限度，這種立法應當開啓一條路：重建我們城市中的被破壞區，並鼓勵私人資本對於大規模建屋計劃敷十億元的投資。這種立法應規定改善農村區之房屋，並在四年內建造五十萬幢房租低廉的公房。應授權平時聯邦房屋機關保證有效運用我們在房屋陣綫上的資源。</p>
<p>財政事務</p>
<p>第四個重大政策和平衡預算有關。在目前這樣的繁榮時期，聯邦政府的預算應該平衡。我們欲審愼處理公共的財政，必須開始减少公債。本皇期內我將向諸位所提出的預算，還有一些剩餘。在預算案的咨文內，我提出各種建議，這些建議結果將造成更大的剩餘，以便運用償付國價。建調中之一是：國會屬從早採取行劃，以使在明年財政年內繼續戰時的稅率，這個稅率在目前的法律下將於一九四七年六月卅日滿期。</p>
<p>關於戰爭的支出仍然很高。减輕世界的飢荒和痛苦，必需很可觀數目的錢。對退伍軍人的協助將繼續進行。現在世界的局勢仍需大量的軍費支出。公債的利息和其他若干費用是不能减少的。</p>
<p>為了這些理由，我對於預算的準備，不得不實行撙節。我希學國會在邁個經濟計劃方面將與我合作。</p>
<p>農業問題</p>
<p>第五個重要政策是關於農民的福利。一九四六年糧食的生產已達最高峯。我們　類的收養有不少可以屬上售與海外而不致　　我們國內的市場。但在今後數年內，美國的農業　遇到如第一次世界大戰後一樣的危險。</p>
<p>我們全都記得其結果。在需求和價格低落聲中，晨產品　續增加，工業的情形國完全相反，即價格上漲而生產却减少。晨產品一過　，災禍就跟着來了。</p>
<p>我們一定要解決第一次大戰後所不能解決的問題。現有的法律將使一九四七和一九四八年的農產品價格相當穩定，我們應利用這兩年維持並發展我們的市塲，以適應我們的龍大生產力</p>
<p>這些法律的宗旨在於允許戰時至平時約有規律調整。政府支特物價的計劃並不是為吸收生產率極高的農業的無限過　而設。在保陣期滿前，我們不應觀望，我們亟應為永久農村福利奠定基礎。</p>
<p>農民自應有公允的收入。我們常能發現各種途徑，俾使他們能善用們他的新技能和較好的方針，使他們能擴展其在國內外的市塲，實施平時生產均衡方式的目標，務使農民和政府不致蒙受無謂的損失和費用。</p>
<p>一般福利</p>
<p>在我們的國家富源中，沒有比國人的健康再貴重的了。一年以前，我曾向國會表示我對國家健康計劃的意見。國會對這種計劃中的若干建議曾有所行動。亦即關於精神衛生，母親和兒童的衛生和醫院建設等方面的建議。我曾　請國會完成於去年的工作，並實施計劃中最重要的建議，即以充足的醫藥治療供應於所有需要此項治療的人。這種供應並非慈善性質，乃就實行該計劃所得提款項下支付。</p>
<p>行政上的一種變更對更進一步推行我們的衛生，敎育和福利等國家計劃將有莫大助益。我再度建議設立一完整的福利部。</p>
<p>退伍軍人</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰的一·千四百萬服役人員現已返回平民生活。其中大部已安居樂業。這種調整這麼迅速而且成功地完成對服役人員和我們的經濟都有莫大貢獻。</p>
<p>在聯邦政府的資助下，一一百萬以上的退伍軍人己進入學校或獲得就業的技術。萬千傷病退伍軍人侮日均獲得醫藥和醫院治療。政府並替五十萬名左右的退伍軍人担保，取得貸款，用以購置房屋，農塲或創立新事業。殘廢或死亡的退伍軍人獲得酬報金的已達二百萬人。三百萬以上仍持有政府發給的人壽保險單。領受失業等薪貼費的退伍軍人已達七百萬各。</p>
<p>除遺散費外，實施退任軍人計畫每年約費七十億元以上，約等於我們聯邦預算總數五分之一。任何國家所未有底和遠大的退伍軍人計劃。</p>
<p>除若干小調整外，我相信我們的退伍軍人計劃現已完成。這種計劃的成就如何將來不致由取得金融上援助的退伍軍人究有多少和我們所費的金元目來判斷。歷史將不致根據我們所費的數目來判斷，而將根據我們使我們的退伍軍人能獻身為國的更大貢獻究屬如何來判斷。當我們考慮任何其他立法議案時，我們應注意這一點。</p>
<p>最近我們在國內看到許多人攻擊公民個別的憲法權，這是由於種族和宗敎偏執的結果。我們人民有不少不能享受到參加選舉地方和國家公務員的選舉。參加合法職業的自由己被否認了。向這些罪惡作戰的意志應該在我們每一個人的心中。</p>
<p>至於聯邦政府，現在正由司法部盡量進行這種戰鬥。憲法雖阻止聯邦政府在若千州內保持和平，但我不相信目下的立法達到聯邦權力的界限以保護人民的公權。因此我已用行政命令設立總統的公民權委員會，以使研究並報告整個公權問題，而向國會提出建議。（完）</p>

<h3>娛樂筵席旅棧三捐　減低稅率查通過　財政局長谷春帆出席預算會報告　減稅後總預算將少三百億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第二次火會，主要任務在於審查市府卅六年度預算，該會預算委員會以上次大會時間匆促，審查預算不够詳密，此次特加鄭重審查，昨整日舉行審查會議，自上午九時半起至九時許始散會。全日審查市府八局，及總務處，民政處之經常臨時收支預算，有關各局長官均出席說明。</p>
<p>昨日預算會審查各局預算時，特別注意各局處行政經費，除查究員工人數外，並詳詢各局所備車輛。據委員會表示：希望各局能儘量裁减，以輕市民負担。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕市財政局局長谷春帆，昨日出席市參議會預算委員會審查會議，報吿本市旅棧捐，原按百分之二十征收，現照中央規定减爲百分之五，則原列本年度預算八十四億元，將减少六十三億元。娛樂捐原爲百分之四十，亦將减至百分之二十五，則的按原列預算二百洋七餘億元减少七成，話劇捐則擬减至百分之十五，但尙須呈請中央核示。筵席捐前定起稅點爲三千元，現改爲五千元，但中西菜均一律照辦，有音樂跳舞餐廳則按娛樂捐百分之二十五征收，其他則分甲乙兩等，甲等征收百分之二十，乙等百分之十，根據目前收稅，筵席捐中百分之六十乃自七十餘家餐廳征收而得，故尙無影響，但百分之四十係收自乙等小型菜館，如此則又將减少一半，的减五十億元。使用牌照稅按中央規定征收後，將减少二十六億元。以上各項收稅减少後，將按總預算减去約三百億元。如市府新列勞動代役金四百億元不能獲大會通過，則卅六年度總預算至少將减少七百億元，即約佔全部三分之一。</p>
<p>谷局長並解釋：營業稅一般認爲太低，而實際上已不能再增加，中央規定八種特種貨物稅後，營業稅即不能再收。財局根據直接稅局征收之五千戶爲標準，調查後應收者計七千五百戶，但已申報者僅四萬二千戶，此七千五百戶中大多爲攤販，財局為顧念小販負担起見，亦未予催稅。同時營業稅並非全依營業收入而征，而依佣金及資本征收，故預算中雖列入二百八十億元，實際尙不能照征。關於房捐，中央旣已有法令規定，本市當可照辦，但前曾請中央核准依現定辦法征收，迄今尙無覆示。屠宰稅規定每猪重量一律按八十斤計算，局方曾詳細調查，此一標準確係合理。營業牌照稅預算收入九億元，或可增加，但估計殊爲困難，尙待研究。</p>

<h3>我被俘字兵由澳抵滬　各團體歡迎慰勞　江灣道上絡繹不絕</h3>

<p>法商電享實行「慢工」各站乘各佇立鵨候擁擠不堪（本報記者攝）</p>
<h3>法商電車　蝸牛慢步　營方否認為年賞問題　公司每最損失數千萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來法商電車因勞資料紛，發生「慢工」現象，霞飛路上，電車相接，如蝸牛慢步，乘客多棄車步行。記者向職工方面探悉，此次「慢工」並非在於年賞問題及增加工資之糾紛，而爲不滿炎方之「公司章程」，蓋公司規定：（一）每站必停，（二）不到站不能停，（三）不得超越規定時間，否則須受停工之處分，目前因此受罰而尙在停工期中者，即有一五九號等三人，工人方面爲作有力反抗起見，遂藉口遵守公司章程，實行到站必停及不到站不能停之規定，而故意延緩行駛時間，使之形成牛步化。但據資方表示，勞方常不遵守公司章程，遲延交款時間，侮慢乘客，致營業情形不佳，近日發生「慢工」後，公司損失日達三四千萬元之鉅，故現正呈請社會局處理中。</p>

<h3>浴缸藏金全出捏造　漁管處人事磨擦　造成復興島疑案　檢察官三勘結果內幕已明八九　硬化水泥查係意圖盜賣之物資</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕錯綜複雜之復興島藏金疑案，經地檢處檢察官顧宏標月餘艱苦偵查，案情已明白十之八九。昨晨九時顧檢察官偕楊乃昌書記官會同行總余樂醒委員，作第三决復興島之行，至下午四時許始回上海。在島上遍訊行總農業委員會漁管處各有關職員，如技術委員王千里，事務科長李雲鵬，及王頌謙，金振聲，王以康，許復七等十數人。顧檢察官回地檢處後，又即匆匆提訊在押之陳家活，譚新民二人，將一日所得作一番對證。二人雖仍堅不吐實，但終於爲顧檢察官證實密吿人「楊弼亨」確有其人，且其眞姓確係姓楊。</p>
<p>此案起因，係由於漁管處人事磨擦，因此其中夾雜若干傾軋誣陷之成分。目前爲止，已知二浴缸金條之事全出於揑造。</p>
<p>物資雖有走漏痕跡，但證據難以找到，數目更無法估計。顧檢察官現將此無頭案分作三部份（一）楊弼亨或「楊弼湯」誣吿漁管處職員等隱匿金條及物資（二）「白志才」　吿李雲鵬貪汚反動等罪嫌（三）前日軍遺留物資，由漁管處職員勾通當時駐島海軍排長牛春霖（已由海军軍法處判刑）等共同隱匿盜賣。上述三部分大致俱有眉目。先說「楊弼亨」其眞姓爲楊，「弼亨」。「弼湯」若非其表字，便是化名。楊受某兩高級職員指使而吿发，顧檢察官雖尙未知其正確住處，但極可能在短期內找到此神秘人物。化名「白志才」密吿李雲鵬貪汚等罪一節，已查明實是誣吿，主動敎唆人是鄭子平，密吿信起稿是鄭國棟，王金棟，抄寫是鄭維新，四人早已收押在看守所中，渠等均屬受人指使。昨日顧檢察官在復興島特訪問參與指使寫密吿信之某太太，但該某太太早已避匿不見。至於勾結海軍盜賣日軍遺留物資，已是極明顯之事實，海軍牛春霖排長被捕後，曾有人密吿，謂李雲鵬曾送黃金三十兩給牛春霖家屬，昨日撿察官曾詢李究竟，雖李祗承認曾經探望牛之家屬。惟檢察官認爲李係事務科長，所有工人均由其雇用，而工人又多係島上海軍所介紹，因此李雲鵬與牛有關係，似亦爲无法否認之事實。至究竟李之嫌疑程度若何，至今尙不能確定。現李已由行總淤署长担保決無逃亡之處。再有去年十二月三日顧檢察官第二次赴復興島時所發現埋藏地下業已硬化之水泥，現亦已查明係日軍遺留物資，某高級職員企圖隱匿盜賣，後以無法運出，遂埋地下，以圖湮沒罪證。</p>
<p>昨日　檢察官第三次　察時。　管處處長許復七，副處長王以康，事務主任李經，。科長李雲鵬，及最初負責接收工作之技術委員王千里俱在，經過五小時以上訊問，顯檢察官已知其間微妙之人事關係。顧檢察官將於今晨趁車晋京，或將在京躭擱數日，放本案週內極少再有新發展可能</p>
<h3>江寗路火燒　三廠大損失</h3>

<h3>互控漢奸罪　傳問老塾師</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日高院審訊原被吿兩造均有漢奸嫌疑一案，緣顧汝舫曾充偽保長，暨曹家渡怡康里七號土棧司閣，以協助敵偽，實施毒化被控。吿發人陳繼庚，曾在敵眞如無綫電台爲職工，因偷竊燈泡電綫，為顧汝舫看見，嗣彼電台開革，疑顧報吿，因之懷恨，遂控顧於高檢處。顧亦反控陳繼庚有漢奸嫌疑，遂一併起訴，昨在高院審訊，並傳訊證人邱廷珍。邱係一老私熟敎師，證言對顧有利，稱顧之出任偽保長，係經民衆推選云。</p>
<p>倪謙吉漢奸嫌疑案，昨日高院開庭傳訊證人。緣倪被控與偽浙江保安處長徐念　合作，開設銀行，織綢廠，火腿行等，並爲敵織造知殺飛機用之軍用絲綢。昨日證人張繼忠，吳滿松，羅海勳，史錦榮，到庭陳述，對被吿有利，稱所織之華錦縐，係普通商品，並非軍用，庭諭改期再訊。　吳劍沖　曾任忠義救國軍第八支隊中隊長，軍統局上海區行動員，二十八年在松江爲日警備隊逮捕，釋出後奉忠救軍之命，參加僞組織，充任僞警察所長，嗣又爲敵滬南憲兵隊捕去，終於變節附敵，充任敵憲密探，並將我兩路特別黨部委員兼書記長吳傑之行踪，報告敵憲，致吳爲敵逮捕。前經高院判處有期徒刑八年，被告不服上訴，經最高法院發還更審。昨日審訊時，被告竭力爲自己辯白，仍稱做地下工作，並未變節。吳傑爲敵逮捕，並非渠報吿。庭諭定十四日上午宣判。</p>
<p>李虎於民國三十三年十月二十日加入敵方華中水產公司護航隊，充任副官，兼代分隊長，前經高院判刑二年六月，被吿不服上訴，經最高法院發還更審。昨日審訊時被告對所任為職，，堅決否認，庭諭定十四日上午宣判。</p>

<h3>楊文道案誣告人曾元被提起公訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高檢處公吿，曾元漢奸嫌疑案業已提起公訴。按曾元乃誣吿楊文道之原吿，楊文道十年寃獄，勝利後平反，宣吿無罪，楊遂控曾於高檢處。又顧黨源漢奸嫌疑罪，李佛文漢奸及內亂嫌疑罪，均提起公訴。楊秀生（又名秉毓）漢奸嫌疑案，不予起訴。</p>
<h3>有望赦免監犯　造具名冊候核</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大赦令頒佈後，思南路地院看守所，前昨兩日共有二百餘犯人取保釋放。記者爲此走訪上海監獄是否採取同樣措施，擬負責人稱，該處爲愼重計，尙未採取同樣揹施，現在進行者為準備工作，將合乎大赦令赦免條例之犯人，全部造具名册將其應予赦免或减刑部分標出，一目暸然，俟部頒减刑辦法奉到後，即行迅速辦理。</p>

<h3>收據發票　貼花辦法　財政部解釋疑義</h3>
<p>工商各業在發售貨物時，往往開立發票，於收到貨款時，復另立收據，發票與收據雖依據稅法均有黏貼印花之義務，，但屬同一營業，則兩者同貼印花，似涉重複，茲悉本案已經上海直接稅局呈奉財部核示三項辦法如次：（一）在同一營業之收據上已貼足印花，其發票或帳單雖已免予貼花，但須與收據粘附一處，以便檢查。如收據失散，則發票或帳單則以漏稅論處。故立據者開立上項憑證，務須粘附一處，以免處罰，同時爲防　客撕散起見，立據者應在發票或帳　加蓋「印花已貼第X號收據」戮記，幷在收據加蓋「此係第X號發票或帳單收據」戳記，則是項憑證無論如何保存，均不難查對，自毋庸有被罰之慮。（二）同一營業之發票先期開立並貼足印花，其在後開立之收據，仍由立據者與發票貼附一處，幷加蓋　記者，自可免貼印花，否則即須分別貼花。（三）發票與收據所列價款不符時，應按款額較高者貼花，上項辦法已經該局轉函商會，並通知有關同業知照矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕地院昨審理謝子賢控吿牙醫司徒博所創辦之牙醫專科學校，請求判令增加給付地租金一案，因林森中路馬當路口之牙醫專科學校地產，係謝子賢所有，原租於徐德記，訂期二十二年，至民國四十一年滿期。民國廿年，徐德記又將租賃權出讓於司徒據，當時訂明每年地租五百六十元，現謝要求增加二千倍給付。昨日開庭，由該校法定代理人潘公展委託趙祖慰律師出庭，提呈辯訴狀一件並辯稱市府規定租金僅一四四倍，現該校所付出之一切費用實已超出此數，且期滿後地上建業物皆歸業主所有，故其利益實已不薄，二千倍之要求毫無根據，請求庭上駁回，該案辯論終結，庭諭十四日宣判。</p>
<h3>貝祖詒香港歸來　對記者笑談天氣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕幾個月來，香港僑匯逃避和走私的情形，似乎越發的猖獗了。引得大家都掉頭南望，希望政府遲早要把這個漏洞，給杜塞了才好，終於，在去年耶誕前四日，中央銀行總裁貝訊詒帶領了行政院英籍經濟顧問羅傑士等多人，包下了中航專機，直飛香港，貝氏行前一日，還匆匆地上南京一次。於是，大家不期而然的想到，貝氏此行，是負有重大底經濟使命的。可是，不知爲了天氣的影響，還是別的原因，上海報紙早在一週前就刋載貝氏返滬的消息，貝氏却始終不曾來。大家渴望的結果，昨天下午一點一刻，貝氏一行的專機，終於降落　　機塲，敏感的新聞同業，在三點敲過，就有一批到中央　行迎候。貝總　遲遲不到，等久了，只得一個個的　去。五點　過，第二批又到中央銀行迎候。好客易把卡片交茶役遞了進去，看看沒有拒見的跡象，大家安心的坐下等候。好一會兒，見了。大家你爭我奪的搶了一把白紙，執筆在手，等候貝總裁發表此行收穫。貝總裁關頭一句話：「沒有什麼可說的……「經不起大家一再的逼問，他笑了笑說：「有兩樣好說的，一是香港的天氣，比上海溫暖。還有，香港的花旗橘子和蘋莫特別多。其他的……對不起了，只有等我上南京去後再跟你們說罷。」此後大家又展開游擊式的問題，貝總裁又說。「外邊對我此行收穫成收的猜測，只得由他們猜測，我是爲四萬萬的中國人民做事，而並不是爲這些猜測家做事，所以我做事只要問心無愧，也就滿足了：」大家失望了，只得懷着依舊空着的新聞慾胃，沒精打采地辭去。（上爲貝氏近影，本報記者攝）</p>

<h3>花業鉅子陳子馨談　滬郊棉農苦況　耕耘所入不及成本之半　棉花滯銷花廠宣告破產　挽救辦法首須改良品種</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪浦東花紗業鉅子陳子馨氏，叩詢浦東火機花乏銷眞相，承談：江蘇一省，產棉甲全國，而上海附近各縣，雖以氣候較濕，溫暖季候不長，惟仍不失為優良之植棉區。几農田百分之五十，均用以植棉。戰前每年之產量，已達八十萬担。第以受戰事影響，使原有之改良品種計劃，不得不為之中輟，以致品種日益退化。據稱戰前浦東所產之火機花大部係供各紗廠應用，其餘則運銷日本印度等地。戰後各廠以人工及動力開係，利用火機花結果，成本增高，而產品巨致减少，故火機花之去路遂狹。然依渠所知：各軋花廠去年九月間所收購之火機花，尙有二萬担。常時進價，每担約廿萬元，茲加上數月利息，成本每担已達卅餘萬元。然目前時價，每担已跌至的十七萬元。影響所及，巳有若干軋花廠，宣吿破產。至棉農手中之有花，現亦有卅餘萬視。以其生產成本言，若就上海附近八縣平均計算，每畝的產一百市斤，籽棉合一砠半（即一包半），每砠籽棉市秤計六十七斤。在本年九月底新籽棉上市時，每砠售價二萬七千元，現則步跌至二萬七千元，棉農每畝收入，合計祗有四萬〇五百元，其自力耕柿者，計算種籽，原料，人工成本，並繳納賦稅，每畝至少在法幣十萬元以上。若係佃農，成本更必加重。按照目前花衣每百斤（司馬秤）僅價十六萬元，是農民年終辛苦收入，每百市斤籽花之値，尙不足成本之半。質言之，即農民收籽棉一担，必須虧折成本一半，甚致不及成本三分之一。故農民處境，殊堪憐憫。治標辦法，最好能按成本設法收購。否則，今春農民將無興緻再行播種。根本辦法，尙須從改良品種着手。因火機花滯銷之大原因，係不能用作製造細紗之用，如改良品種，使能用以製造廿支紗，則情形即可好轉。現各關係方面正合擬一改良品種辦法，係以戰前浦東楊思區改良棉種之辦法為監本。並將全力會同關係機關，促其實現，俾期增進棉花生產，而解決農民生計云。</p>
<h3>絲織業申請生產貸款　移交四聯總處審議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市電機絲織業同業公會，以聞本週三生產貸款臨時審核委員會例會時，對該業申請貨款案件，有否決情事，羣情惶恐，昨上午十時起，即舉行臨時緊急會議，當推定蔡　濤劉慶一等代表多人，分向生產貸款會常務理事李馥蓀，徐寄廣，秦潤卿，林鳳苞等，探詢眞相，當知事出誤會。而週三例會時係議決：將該業貸款案件，移交四聯總處貸款小組會審議。昨日下午五時許，各代表等復携呈赴市府，擬請吳市長代為約定生產貸款會主委霍亞民一叙，傳便面陳該業目前底境，亟待貸款濟急，以　年關。據稱：四聯　　貸款小組會之貸款條件較　，大部須以原料成品作押，故對該榮貸款，迄目前為止，認額不過五十五億餘元。今生產貸款會之貸款，半數得以機器作押，俾各廠能活川所得資金。各廠表示如獲得該會貸款，　原有　聯總處核准在中交兩行發貸之貸款，決即侯還。</p>

<h3>美國工商協會主張　修改對華貿易政策　減低美國關稅壁壘　重視中國保護主義</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約七日常〕遠東美國工商協會會長富益曾於上月下旬，代表四百家會員公司，以節略一件送呈國務院交換情報委員會，關於明春與中國議訂貿易協定一事，主張修改對華貿易政策及妨礙美國對華輸出之關稅佔値，减低美國出口貨稅率，並對非競爭性之中國商品，减低美國關稅壁壘。各該公司雖曾提出種種减稅要求，但該節略所涉及者僅為一般貿易政策。該協會促請當局特別注意，務使中國當局對於進口貨之估値採取合理而不變之政策。綠該協會會接到美國出口商行之呈訴，謂中國當局估計進口稅往往根據中國之黑市價格，而並不依據眞正之批亞市價。此舉不僅造成市價之紊亂，並足以刺激貨價之上漲。該節略內另一段指出中國公佈及實施貿易條例手續有改進之必要。未經及早通知進出口業及有關中國代理商行，遽行公佈新限制條例，往往使與由國交易之美國商行遭過穩種困難。該協會鑒於中國亟需各種機器設備及外國原料，主張將美國對華輸出多種貨物之一關稅予以减低。觀於中國商界最近所持保獲關稅之主張，此點實具有特殊重大意義。目前中國進出口貨之差額甚鉅，中國出口貨懂及進口貨之一小部分，故該協會建議將中國進口貨之稅率儘量予以减低。事實上自中國輸入美國之貨物可能减低稅率者，為數有限，故此項政策允有推行之必要。戰前自由國轍人之商品，包括桐油，生絲，生毛皮等重要原料，其中半製至三分之二均屬免稅。但應稅進口品之平均稅率則在値百抽五五以上。該協會認為此等稅率倘能切實減低，則必能刺激中國貨物之進口，而糾正中國目前輸出輸入不平衡之狀態，此種狀態之存在晨近曾迫使市國政府採取輸入許可制度。該協會怖略復稱：下列各種手工藝及家庭工業出品，如地毯，花邊，繡品，髮網，磁器，竹器，草帽辮等，尤應减低其稅率。蓋此類貨物並不與美國出品發生競爭，且在戰前在美國簡塲中早巳有確定之地位。由於中國通貨膨脹及經濟崩潰造成國內高漲之生活費，故所征課之進口稅往往較戰前高出數倍，致其銷路大受影響。為促進健全之互惠貿易，此類商品不特應予減稅，旦應置於免稅貸物之列。該節路最後稱：在外匯未曾穩定，中國貨幣之官定價値未與實際購買力保持一致以前，中國出口業根本無改進之可能。因此該協會建讓除實行減低稅率外，中國政府應同時採取穩定幣制之措置</p>

<h3>大專籃球昨賽　大同力戰勝同濟　女子組滬江擊敗大夏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大專籃球聯誼賽，昨日下午共三塲角逐，均在市體育館舉行，觀眾二千餘人，滬江女隊戰大夏時，啦啦隊到塲助威，聲勢至為熱烈，惜觀眾水準太低，不識啦啦隊之為何物，每以「汽水聲」對之，實煞風景。各塲結果如下：</p>
<p>專科組新專勝工專</p>
<p>首幕戰中國新專對工專，裁判李震中，雙方均缺乏聯絡，戰來頗為乏勁，毫無精彩可言。首節工專以八比六佔先，而前半時竟以十三比十九落後，下半時新專趙劍，左右逢源，扶搖直上，結果以四十二比廿九，大勝工專。</p>
<p>滬江女將大敗大夏</p>
<p>次幕女子組，滬江對大夏，裁判張覺非，滬江女子隊，由校長凌憲揚親自率領，在啦啦隊助威聲中入塲，笛聲響處，滬江丁茀珩首創紀錄，連接中的，隊長王珊不甘落後，六投皆中，大夏幾無招架之功，且滬江後衛華惠珍·李愛暄·戰來巧妙活潑，大夏投手吳容林，左右逢「墻」，無計可施，首局滬江以十七比五遙領於先。次局開始，王珊隊長，戰來更為有勁，大有萬夫莫擋之槪，連中四球，大夏見勢不佳，呼暫停以避銳風，風時加強後衛，果見功效，吳容林再兩擲一罰，始渡過難關，前半時滬江以廿五比十佔優勢。下半時雙方陷於混戰，獲分極鮮，迨最後一節，各戰將均已香汁淋淋，疲乏無力矣。結果滬江以卅二比十四，大敗大夏。</p>
<p>壓軸大戲同濟佔先</p>
<p>壓軸戰同濟逢大同，裁判張覺非，李震中，大同隊中擁有二餘老將徐仲己，及汕隊健將林維聰，一前一後，聲勢威赫，同濟陣容則較平均，雖多「排骨」，然衝刺之力極猛。角逐開始，同濟蕭成一罰，首破鴨蛋，大同王治平以牙還牙，罰成平手。混戰多時，大同徐仲已左右開功，第一節以七比五佔先一球，第二節開始，同濟攻勢猛列，蕭成·江尚清·你擲我投，建功甚多，而大同僅徐仲已一人活躍，終以獨木難支，前半時大同卒以十八比廿落後一球。</p>
<p>沉着應戰大同告捷</p>
<p>易陣再戰，雙方你爭我奪，曾於廿二·廿八兩度造成平手，終因大同徐仲己·林維聰·老將不凡，沉着應戰，終於以卅二比廿八超出。最後一節，大同奮起直追，楊前坤遠射近攻，建功極多，然大同老將徐仲己，如虎入羊帬，所向無數，終勝一籌，結果同濟以四十比四十三，負於大同三分。雙方戰績錄下：</p>
<p>大同　犯分　同濟　犯分</p>

<h3>青海在奮鬥中</h3>
<p>— 靑海一月二日航訊　徐棠影</p>
<p>在十年以前國人們對于靑海這個地方的概念，大半還是十分淡漢的，即使有，也不過是說：「靑海，那是一片荒凉的地方呀」，可是經過了近十年來的奮門，一直到了今日，靑海却完全地蛻變了出來，這猶如一個四五歲的黃毛丫頭，幾年不見，她便會出落得一表人材，所以以前到過靑海的人，在第二次到靑海的時候，便不期而然的驚訝它的進步了。</p>
<p>政治的安定　民族的團結　是鞏固邊防潛力</p>
<p>靑海本來是一個處女地帶，在這裏永遠是充滿着恬靜溫暖的空氣，崑崙山上，白雪依然晶瑩，哥達素齊老峯，依然高入雲靑，環繞祖國的黃河長江，依然洶湧澎湃的東流。所不同的，就是在政治的努力下，驟然增加了熙熙　　的幾多城市，和偉大緊密的各種組織，即在今日新設的各縣局，如祁速，稱多，昂謙，興海等，從這裏面發生了不知多少的力量。牽引着純潔的胥海，勇邁的奔赴前程，在維厚的力量中，保障了中華民國西南的國防之確立。但在過去，有誰能够担保會有今日的情况呢？因爲靑海有一種長久歷史的宗族問題，是複雜，是辣手，在滿淸時代的回漢仇視，就是一例，現在靑海所包括的宗族，有漢，滿，蒙，回，藏，哈薩，薩拉，土著，猓　等，以所過的生活形態而言，有的地方，已經有了汽車，有的地方還在騎着毛牛，有的已經建築着高樓大厦，有的還在居住蒙古包和藏幕，言語上有差異，信仰上有區分，有人說新疆是民族的展覽會，那麼靑海就可說是民族的陳列室了。但在今日，這許多極不相同的宗族，却能和和氣氣，有如家人，造成全國各省甚至舉世稀有的奇跡，即如有淸一代，就存有宗族偏見和仇恨的人民，到今日也能忘却前怨，而和好如初了，現在靑海的二百萬人民都能平平安安，不受任何波浪的生活着，這種精誠團結的精神，的確是靑海的寳貝，這個結晶，要不是從近十幾年來政治努力中得來，那還能够這樣嗎？所以今日西藏的安全，完全和靑海的這一股潛伏的力量，大有關係，而不容人們輕視的，同時也因爲太和氣了。不免要遭到人家的嫉妬，這個中問，許多專事吹毛求疵的人，便自然不觀大　，而只拿上小的地方，來造謠生事，雖然這樣，但靑海的民族間，却如磨鍊金子般的，一次比一决明亮了，在抗戰中閱蔣主席曾經巡行西北，當蔣主席到了靑海以後，曾經說：「抗戰靠東南，建國靠西北」。因爲西北在地位和物產上，確有値得重視的地方，尤其是靑海，不但有一望無垠的草原，可供千萬牛羊的放牧，更有儲藏豐富的礦山，發掘無數的寳藏，如大通有每天可出產數萬觔的石煤，並且可以繼績的開採到七十餘年，茶石浪的無烟煤，更可以當作開辦工廠的大後盾，數量不但多，而且火力十分足，在最近民和又發見了大量的石油，只要有機器，有人材，這一股「國家的血液」，是値得珍視的，此外無盡的皮毛角骨，是靑海的寳貝，在祁連山麓，還有很多的陶土石英，是製造傢具的好材料，這一切都是我國正需要的，但是這些都要以人和爲前提，假使地方沒有安定的力量，那麼不但政治建設無進步，就是民族間的大大小小的問題，都要鬧得痛苦，所以我們要觀察靑海，却要從大的成績上去着想，如果捨了大體，只是在一點二點的疏忽地方來看，那就要陷於捨本逐末，所以今日西南國防的安定，就是在政治上有着這一種造就潛伏力量的綠故。</p>
<p>軍政的配合　敎育的進展　在困難中打生路</p>
<p>去世的威爾基先生，是到過靑海的，他認爲靑海的政治和軍事，是相當的成功，尤其是政軍合一了，所以表現更爲良好，這論斷的確是有遠見的，是不允別人疑惑的，因為靑海省政府自二十五年改組後，政治與軍事便密切的配合起來，所以公路的修築，荒原的開墾，林苗的培育，水利的振興，都是軍民合作的成果，去年建修的靑藏公路，今年建修的靑新公路，都是長達千餘公里，沿途蠻烟療雨，無水無草，而毒蚊毒蜂，使人不能睜眼，一睜限，眼中就可生蛆，以至傷目，雖然天候地勢的障碍如此，但靑海的人民，却毫不畏縮地動員了起來，而且竟達數萬人之多，不過問題並不這樣簡單，因爲沿途還有薩匪騷擾，成羣刧掠，於是當地的保安部隊，前往保護，駐省的國軍，更是大部動員，前往帮助人民工作，這在修路工作上，生了不少的效用，本來靑海的百姓，一向就苦，加以爲了抗戰，生活越發苦不可言，但是只要公益，只要是國事，便會忘却自身的痛苦，而奉行維謹，努力以赴，這是靑海老百姓的可愛處，也是現階段的中國，所最需要的民氣。因爲有了這種好處，靑海的駐軍協助百姓，而百姓尊敬軍人，於是形成了和愛合作的密切感情，記得去年今年修靑藏靑新兩路時，軍民遠入不毛，糧食往往斷絕，看看大家莫得吃了，安不憂心如焚，豈知軍隊們却想出了辦法，去打些野馬黃羊，打回來了，却先分給斷炊的老百姓去吃，就此一點，便可曉得靑海駐軍與當地百姓的感情，是如何拿理想，駐在靑海的國軍，不但與人民保持着根深蒂固的友誼，而且爲國生產柴達木盆地，靑海湖畔，都由他們開墾的麥浪迎風，禾委盈疇，以往的荒涼平原，在今日已成了沃野千里，往日的不毛鹵地，到今日却將有華實蔽野的可能，甘靑公路，也有他們的血汗，靑海歷年所栽的樹木，已達二千萬株，甚閱有一半是他們的手澤，抗戰以前，他們更以低劣的武器和旺盛的士氣，打擊了由蜀西竄，意欲完成羅明路綫的匪類，更以萬餘人的兵力殲滅了徐向前三軍之衆，以後又在河西，隴東，海南，漢北，立下了不朽的戰功，對於奠定西北平安的基礎，是有莫大的功勞，三十四年新疆情况緊張時，由修築了甘靑公路的一部國軍，在靑海訓練了一年，經武整軍，兵强馬壯，遂又度過了玉門關，在星星峽外，打定了綏靖的基石，抗戰中間，在安徽及中原平原，靑海的騎兵，曾各聞全國，建立了不少的光榮奇蹟，即是頑強的日本人，也不能不視爲一旅勁敵，所以　使有人到了靑海，你便會在任何地方，聽到老百姓對於軍隊的頌搗，現在靑海國軍的駐軍區，是樂家灣和李堂，除了地方的保安團隊外，人數共約一師，這是今年五月，率命出一軍人縮　而成的，　餘遣散的官兵，都得到了很好的安排，以後國防部，西北行轅，都先後派員點騐，對於軍紀和軍務，都有一番眞確的好許，所以這一股國家的力量，在西北是有相當的光榮歷史，在國家可說是最精銳的份子，要是說到靑海的政治，可以說是十分單純的，而且因爲靑海當局，能够在政治上講求效率，所以凡是實施政策，沒有一件不成功的，舉凡識字造林·編組保甲·禁絕烟毒·都是尅期完成，其中尤其難能可貴的，是抗戰八年來，靑海沒有一個漢奸，沒有一個奸黨，和小批的土匪，橫行的盜賊，這種成效，全是由政治得來的。現在全國需要的是在安定中求進步，而靑海却是最先應用這項法則的，而且成功很快，這是有目共睹的事實，所以靑海的進步，實在說起來，完全是有了一個健全政府的緣故，所有的公敎人員，大半是中等學校資格，但都能脚踏實地，刻苦工作，政府對於公敎人員的生活，更是關心的無微不至，除了按規定每月發支薪俸外，每年還由政府想法配發冬夏衣料和皮毛石炭等，一般公敎人員的生活，還能維特到最低限度、靑海的學校，數量相當可觀，現在已有中等學校六處，小學校八百餘所，比較以前，不但數量加多，而且質量也提高。二十年前，在外省升學的人，只有一個兩個，現在統計起來，在國內各大學中，已不下百餘人，就此一例，便可算出靑海敎育進步的程度，但是一般的文化水準，尙待積極提高。敎部邊敎司長凌純聲，月前視察靑海敎育之後，在蘭州發表談話，認爲靑海的敎育，異常發達，即西寗一市，已有學生一萬餘人，尤其女子敎育，更爲合理。總之，凌氏自認爲「視察印象極佳」。</p>
<p>經濟的基礎　中央的輔導　使靑海光輝倍增</p>
<p>談到靑海的經濟發展，原是後於政治建設，但因堅强的經濟基礎必須建築在穩固的政治上面，所以靑海政治，自從暫趨安定以後，政府即積極注意到實業的發展，農林·開墾·開礦等工作，都已經先後開始。水利方面，亦在籌劃專門從事灌溉的工程，最近已究成的，已有湟惠渠。自來水渠自來水工程，最近亦由美國專家莫理爾，負責計劃敷設，在明年即可開工。爲了完成以上種種工作，政府特別設立了實業銀行，實業公司和輕工業的海鴉工廠，以專門負起發展靑海實業的賣任，面建立理想的經濟基礎。不過靑海的實業發展在事實上有許多的困難，所以這一方面的表現，仍然十分的幼稚而脆弱，這是邊疆各省的一般現象，靑海自然不能例外，可是靑海本身却有許多優厚的條件，因此，我們相信，只要中央帮助他，指導它，那麼在今日的安定局面下，靑海是最易走上工業化的大道。　截至今天，蒙藏區域都成立了好多處黨部。蒙藏黨員，也有萬餘人，許多的王公活佛，很快的成了國民黨的忠實黨員，這種維繫民族的向心力，和安定邊防的控制力，是値得重視的。不過在以往的選舉方面，總是不見得普　可是近幾年來，這個缺陷，已經完全彌據上了，　如最近的靑海省黨部執監委改選，在人拿方面是包括了蒙·廠·農·工及婦女代表，所以在性質方面，是比較圓滿的，我們對此，自當視為一種進步。</p>
<p>我們旣曉得今日靑海的內幕，是在不斷的改良和進步中，然而靑海仍不能自給自足，急需外來帮助的事實，却是顯而易見的。要是有人忽略了這個問題，那麼許多客觀的條件，將會限制了它的發展，同時，許多有關大體的問題，要是不能予以澈底的觀察，面只仿效中共發言人范長江似的施以無稽的挑撥和誣衊，那科有負邊防艱鉅工作者的苦心和努力了！</p>

<h3>中煤毒</h3>
<p>— 鄭偉如</p>
<p>最近本市報紙已有中煤毒的新聞，無論這事的準確性如何，在每屆隆冬嚴寒的季節，總有因生火取暖而發生這種不幸事件的。闔家的人團聚一堂，慘案的發生，更為嚴重。爰將原因和預防槪述於後，大家曲突徒薪，方為上策。</p>
<p>凡煤塊或木炭熱度加高時，即起燃燒作用，所含的炭質和空氣中的養氣化合起來，所有的炭都變為二氧化炭，並且放出熱力。我們利用這勢力，來推動機器，煮熟食物，在冬天我們還靠以取暖。假使我們利用沒有煙囪設備的火爐生火取暖，並且把四周的窗戶緊閉，那末就有中毒的危險。</p>
<p>一氧化炭</p>
<p>凡煤炭或其它含炭的燃料，在有充分的空氣供給燃燒時，燃料內含的炭分就和空氣中的氧，化合而成二氧化炭，這氣體除非達到極高濃度，否則舊無害的。但是在空氣供給不暢的時候，炭的養化祗達到一氧化炭的地步。這時一氧化炭若積聚室內，就與人體有害。倘使一氧化炭在空氣的濃度達到萬分之六時，人在其中二小時就呈昏迷。如果嘗試達到千分之一時，一小時後即人事不省。又我人處在含有此等氣體的空氣中時間的久暫，與中毒的深淺，大有關係。即使空氣中含量不高，但如我人稽留其中過久，也可中毒很深。實際致我們中毒的，並非煤炭本身，而是炭未經完全氧化的一氧化炭，故應　名之為一氧化炭中毒。</p>
<p>病原</p>
<p>我人身體內的紅血球，其任務是把肺臟所含的氧氣帶到各部組織，待把養氣交代各組織後，再回到肺臟搬取養氣，輸送至各組織。所以紅血球唯一的任務是養氣的搬運，缺了這個搬運夫或缺了養氣，我們都無法生存。這一氧化炭氣體，並非是我們身體裏所需要的，但是紅血球和它的親和力，比和養氣要高出二百五十倍！所以一旦室內含有一氧化炭，我們也不分彼此的親密關係，比和養氣要高出二百五十倍，所以一經相遇，就和它密切的聯繫而成難解難分的炭氧血包蛋白，而把輸送養氣的任務放棄不顧。假使我們所有的紅血球有三分之一已和一氧化炭結合，我們還不大覺得，如果到達百分之五二，病狀較顯，再進而達到百分之八十時，即經發覺，也將無法救治了。</p>
<p>我們吸入一氧化炭的受患，並不是一氧化炭如何毒性，完全因為紅血球和它密切的聯繫，而把輸送養氣的任務完全忽略了。所以如果大部分的紅血球和它結合，身體各部分就無法得到充分的養氣，而呈缺氣　息的狀態。是為一氧化炭中毒致死的之因。</p>
<p>改善</p>
<p>一氧化炭是無色，無味，並且無臭的氣體，所以即使它侵襲室內我們也無法預知。它比空氣為輕，又不大溶解於水，小孩比成人容易中毒，而鳥類更比人類容易中毒。所以室內如果掛著籠鳥，鳥即先人而倒斃，還有其他用化學方法測騐一氧化炭的方法，不適於家庭的應用。</p>
<p>我們在熊熊的爐火中投入煤塊，如果上層通風良好，即見美麗的藍色火焰上竄，是一氧化炭再經養化的明證。在火爐的下層，空氣由床格遂入，所以煤炭的燃燒完全，所成二氧化炭再往上昇，遇到親的炭質就再結合而成一氧化炭。如果火爐上層的空氣不良，一氧化炭就不再燃燒，如果裝有煙囪，就由煙囪送出，如果上層通氣良好，這一氧化炭再起燃燒，而成蔚藍的火焰。在初生火爐的時候，足以引起燃燒的熱度還不高，空氣的流通也不暢，很容易產生一氧化炭的，此時很可能使室內充溢這有害的氣體。</p>
<p>「中煤毒」一病　不限於斗室內</p>
<p>如果在小室中，再把門窗緊閉，就是燃點油燈，或生炭火取暖，很有中毒的危險。內燃稱經發動後所排的廢氣，也含一氧化炭，一輛二十四馬力的汽車，如果在冬天關閉在僅容一車的汽車間內將引擎發動，其所排的氣可含百分之七的一氧化炭，在五分鐘內，可使車間內的人中毒。在建築物很高而馬路狹小的地段，因交通關係而排列待進的機動車停滯，很可使該地段的空氣含一氧化炭很高，聽說赫特森河底下的荷蘭隧道，除通空的裝置外，如果空氣內的一氧化炭達到某個高度時，有自動的信號放出，以作警告。家用煤氣所含一氧化炭自百分之六至十六，如果煤氣管氣內尚含有其它有臭的氣體，所以除非睡著，否則我人生在未完全中毒之前，先曾發表異狀。</p>
<p>癥狀——最早發現的癥狀是四肢疲憊，頭部沉重及至眩暈心發悸，惡心嘔吐，血液的一半，已經中毒，也有來勢標識，患者不自覓問，已經呼吸迫促，人事不省，　弱而死的，中毒的人，口唇和指甲，都呈樓紅顏色。」</p>
<p>治療和預防　如果發覺有此中毒，就需把含毒氣的房間窗戶暢開，侭量使室內和室外的空氣流通，或把患者抬到通風地方，使其俯臥，再行人工呼吸法，給以氧氣或或內含百分之七的二氧化炭的養血混合氣吸入，一面並使患者溫暖，在毒未深時，仍可得救。至於載上防毒面具冒險到含有一氧化炭的室內營救患者，大可不必，因為此等氣候，不能含有木炭的普通防毒面具所吸引！</p>
<p>室內如有電爐或水汀的裝置，就無一氧化炭中毒的危險。</p>
<p>倘用火爐，並需裝置排氣的煙囪，若用炭盆取暖，最好先在室外生火，待煤炭燒紅後，再侈置室內，加炭時亦然，尤需要啓窗戶，得使空氣排洩，睡眠時必先使炭火熄滅，以免在睡眠中中毒。</p>
<h3>使癱瘓病人妊娠之特種裝置</h3>
<h3>發熱的病原</h3>
<p>— 吳茂娥</p>
<p>患病者必知的常識</p>
<p>發熱的病可分二方面來研討：一是完全根據致熱之原因，則有（一）生理方面之高招，是因環境太熱，或因機械之作用而身體產生過多之熱，熬之發散不夠是主因，如中暑。（二）化學方面之高熱，有許多化學物品函致發表熱反應，如磺胺類藥物，咖啡因等。（三）蛋白質反應而起之熱，無商外物加入證內往往會引起發熱之反應，如血清反應。（四）失去太多也可致高熱。（五）身體內新陳代謝增加也可使發熱，如白血病，中毒性甲狀腺腫屬於此類。（六）傳染病，許多傳染劑如過濾性毒，細菌，原生蟲，立克次禮等皆會致發熱病。（七）神經性發生的高熱由於中腦調溫中樞受損傷。</p>
<p>以上所述為各種致熱之原因，正常人是不會有熱度的，有了熱度就是表示他身上起一種反應，故必須探求此起反應之理始可對癥治療，生理或機械所引起之熱只要得悉患者之環境及行動就不難診斷的。其他化學劑或藥品，失水過多，高新陳代謝等所引起的熱都是有明顯背景的也不難診斷。</p>
<p>二是根據臨診上如何探究發熱病！各種傳染病所發的熱是我們臨診上最常遇見的，種類最多，演變最大，需說加以注意。稱探求其病原下其診斷，就後可以對下藥，否則處此科學時代藥物多時，常會勞而無功甚至有害。</p>
<p>茲特述下列需注意之處：</p>
<p>（一）患者之年齡，籍貫，住址，職業，及生病之時日，以及當時之流行病。某種疾病是限於兒童時代的如麻疹，水痘，腮腺炎，百日咳，水痘，脊髓前灰白質炎等。某些疾病是限於地方性的如黑熱病，日本吸血蟲病等。某些病是夏季流行的如霍亂等以及當時之流行病如流行性感冒與疫等。這些條件都得熱悉始可避輕就重了。</p>
<p>（二）初起病之情況，各種傳染病有各種典型之病程，雖然不曾準是規律的大槪是會有孫樣的起病方式以及會有如此的一個過程。起病的方式約有三種：（一）廢棄或緩起式，大槪表示病演秀慢，如傷寒癥結核癥，黑熱病，此種疾病之病菌進入體內需要較長時間的繁殖，而在此潛伏期中會有欠爽之感覺然後再慢慢的演變成該病典型之過程。（二）驟起式，大槪顯示細菌或某種毒素驟然轉入體內如各種血中毒過敏性毒所引起之病。（三）急性傳染性式，有很顯著之參戰，高熱，頭痛，及嘔吐等指示急性傳染程序開始進行，普通一般急性傳染病如肺炎腦膜炎等癥大都是會如此病。</p>
<p>（三）早期重要之病癥及癥狀：如早期血中毒、衰竭、頭痛、以及全身疼痛在下列諸病是特別顯著，斑疹傷寒，回　熱，懸性瘧疾，流行性傳染及　　，如暴出血，在　寒癥，迴　然，及斑疹傷式頗未見，如劇烈之頭痛及嘔吐當暗示腦模炎　　　　。如果疹時常見於　疾，腦膜炎，及肺炎三癥。</p>
<p>（四）發疹：發疹熱病是可另歸一類，須注意出疹之日期特性教佈及演變。水痘，猩紅熱，大花，蔴癥，斑疹傷寒及傷寒癥皆會有疹子，而其出疹之日期大槪也如上列之程序，水痘之參在第一日可見到，蔴疹之疹子大槪在第四日始顯出。其他如腦膜炎回歸熱及登革驚也會有發疹現象。並且這幾種傳染病之疹皆有其特著之現狀及發展。</p>
<p>（五）體溫之特性：熱度有各種等級，輕熱，溫度在華氏九十九至一百度之間。溫和熱，溫度在華氏一百度至一百零三度之間。高熱，溫度在一百零五度以上。熱度有不同之各類，典型之傳染病皆有其正型之表樣。可另為三類（一）稽留熱，逐日之變動頗微大感不到兩度，斑疹傷寒肺炎猩紅熱皆屬此類。（二）馳張熱，其逐日之變動超過二度惟最低仍在正溫度以上，傷寒癥乃其例也。（三）間歇熱，發熱期與正當期相同或有時在正度下，每期可歷數小時或數日之久互相啣接，此類見于瘧疾之間歇熱，回歸熱及浪熱癥等。</p>
<p>體溫之過程：每一種典型之疾病有牠的特殊熱週期。</p>
<p>短期熱，在十日內減退，這些疾病都是自限性的，如登革熱等。</p>
<p>長期熱，過程也拖延，也是最該注意的，很容易使患者體力漸虛弱而成惡病體質。至少有三種疾病該先考慮到的。傷寒，結核癥，及血中毒，其他長期熱的病有（一）地方性的病如黑熱病日本吸血蟲病瘧疾浪熱等。（二）隱藏之病灶傳染如　炎，女子的慢性骨盆內炎，或亞急性內心膜炎。（三）梅毒及其他的慢性病。</p>
<p>總之要進行診斷發熱的病源，必須先仔細觀察該病自然發熱之過程，以及其他的特殊癥狀，再加上其他之旁證始行！</p>
<h3>發熱之生理與病理</h3>
<p>— 陳悅書</p>
<p>體溫之調節——吾人皆知，人為熱血動物，在普通環境中，能經常保持溫體於攝氏三十七度左近。此穩定之體溫係兩相反作用巧妙保持平衡所致。人日進飲食，胃部消化，心臟跳動，肌肉勞作，各種營養素在體內養化燃燒，在在皆發出熱量以提高體溫。反之，血液繼續不斷流經皮下毛血管，將體內熱量輻射傳導而出，兩肺更時時吸進冷氣呼出熱氣以消散體熱，倘體內熱量仍嫌過多，皮內汗腺即分泌出汗液，汗液蒸發而攝去大量之熱。此生熱與散熱兩作用在正常人體中係受間腦視丘下部之神經中樞所控制而得保持平衡。</p>
<p>發熱之機構——倘此調節體溫之機構被體外過高溫度所壓倒（如中暑），或因其他原因（如細菌感染）所紊亂，則病人發熱矣。發熱時病人發冷抖戰，肌肉孿縮以增生體熱，皮下血管緊縮，汗液消失，儘量減低熱量之消散，故當病人畏冷寒戰之際，體溫即急劇上升矣。此增加生熱與減低消熱兩步驟固皆為發熱機構之一部，然後者實較前者重要，蓋在常人劇烈運動時生熱可增至百分之二三百而毫無發熱之處，反之，在發熱病人，生熱不過增加百分之二三十而已。熱度上升後鄧經神經中樞之作用而稽留於反常之較高水平，其機構頗相似於轉動電　將恒溫器內溫度水平提高。病人熱退時，皮下血管擴張，汗液大出，體內熱量大量放出，神經中樞亦恢復保持正常水平。</p>
<p>發熱之原因——發熱之原因眾多，最普通者為細菌感染（如傷寒，結核癥肺炎等等），此乃眾所週知之事，毋庸贅述。茲略提及數種較不熟知之發熱原因：（一）腦部損害，——前文已提及人體溫係受神經中樞所控制，故腦部損害，尤其傷及間腦及橋腦者，可能波及此神經中樞而引起高熱。（二）倘保持體溫平衡之機構被體外過高之溫度所壓倒，人即發熱，此種發熱，見於中暑，及　用人工高熱療器之時。（三）異性蛋白質（例如靜脈注射牛乳或傷寒菌苗）進入人體，即能引起高熱。瘧疾之發熱及輸血術後之反應熱皆屬於此類。（四）某種惡性瘤常能使患者發熱，其最　者為賢上腺瘤及阿杰金氏肉芽種。（五）某種藥物，亦能使人發熱，綜觀上述，發熱之原因顯甚眾多而複雜，然經科學家仔細推敲研究，又似有共通之途徑可尋，即發熱常為人體對異性蛋白質（此異性蛋白質或來自細菌，原生蟲，或惡性瘤之變質產品等等）侵入之反應是也。</p>
<p>發熱這意義——發熱之意義何在？至今尚未能肯定圓滿答覆在常人目光中，發熱係有害而無益，彰彰明甚，毫無疑問。醫學家亦承認，發熱過高（如在華氏一〇五度上以）對病人極有害，並可致死亡。惟在較低度之發熱中，人體對細菌之抵抗力似較無熱時有利。羅萊及麥加二研究家曾做動物實騐，彼等將動物分為兩組，一組用人工加熱迭便之發熱，另一組剛未使發熱，同時將小量之細菌陸續注射入兩組動物體中，二氏發見發熱之動物產未發熱者生命得保持更久時間，並能抵抗較大量之細菌注射。通常人體抵抗細菌侵襲之機構，可分二部，一為白血球對細菌之吞噬作用，一為抗細菌免疫體（例如抗毒素，凝集素，溶菌素等）之產生。羅萊二氏更進一步之研究發見在發熱動物體中，凝集素及溶菌素之產生，較無熱者旣多且速。故從以上實騐結果，吾人可揣測，發熱似為人體對細菌侵襲之一種保護作用，並非絕對有害無益也。</p>
<h3>醫壇新知</h3>
<p>— 喬樹民寄自紐約</p>
<p>超過了DDT</p>
<p>「抵抵體」（DDT）的殺蟲妙用，差不多是歸孺皆知了。可是科學家們並不以此為滿足，他們用兩個「氟」原子，代替了「抵抵體」分子中的兩個「氯」原子，而成為「抵拂抵體」（DFDTDileuoro　lipnenyl—trichloro—　thane）。近據「抗素師大學」（University　of　Kansas）的不來得老教授（H.　L.　Bradlow）報告，「抵拂抵體」的殺蟲性能，比「抵抵體」還要強，其有效時期亦較持久，但其對於熱血動物的毒性，則較「抵抵體」為低。不過對於冷血動物，毫不留情。冷血動物聽者，您們的末日快到了！</p>
<p>舊法新用</p>
<p>利用「美藍試騐」「Methylene　blutest」，測探尿中有無膽素（Bilirubin），原屬簡而易行的老法子。可是利用牠來診察阿米巴痢病人的肝臟，是否受了牽累，倒是最近才有人想起來。中國的阿米巴肝腥種之類的病便不少，想來在臨床診斷上，必可有應用之處。</p>
<p>原子物理在醫學上應用</p>
<p>自從原子彈在廣島霹靂一聲，真是「驚天動地」，「震世駭俗」。在此和平黯淡疑雲密佈的氣氛中，自不免有人咒詛發則原子核分裂的物理學家。其實，科學的發明，為禍為福，其權在人，科學家本身的罪孽行為，是不應該負責的。例如原子核的分裂現象，同可用以殺人，但亦未始不可用以救人。拿目前的幼稚階段說，對於醫學至少有兩個用途：</p>
<p>所有的物質，差不多都可能用原子分裂器，乘衝擊原子核中的「中子」（Neurons）使其變為具有放射性的物質，例如尋常的燐，是不具有放射性的，但是經過一番原子核的衝擊，可使變成具有放射性的燐，倘使吃進人體，那麼牠的來蹤去跡，可以精確地測繪出來，對於生理學的新陳代謝作用之研究，必可有極大貢獻，而在若干疾病之診斷學方面自可有其用處。</p>
<p>又有許多疾病，是需要放射性療法的（Radi—Therapy）。但是自然界的放射質性物，少得可憐，物以稀為貴，窮病人賤，而且牠們都是從體外照射，功效固　，且多流弊。但是原子物理的貢獻可大了，牠能把我們所需要的物質，變成具有放射性能，可以用口服的方法或注射的方法，使該項物質，直趨病穴，便利，有效，價康，安全——可謂四美俱備矣。</p>
<h3>醫藥化學最新貢獻　人造青黴素</h3>
<p>— 樹</p>
<p>青黴素（Penicillin）是此次戰爭中兩大發現之一，已是盡人皆知的了。可是真正的製造工作，在本年十一月份以前，一直還是藉　「青黴女士」自己，在她的微小細胞工廠內秘密進行，誰也窺瞰不到。然而英美的科學家們，並不甘心，經政府的組織和資助，一共成立了三十七個研究隊（Research　teams）二十六個隊在美國，十一個隊在英國，分頭鑽探，要打開自然秘鍮，要與「青黴女士」爭勝負優劣。</p>
<p>「有志者事竟成」！果然在十一月七日，帖紐約康乃耳大學微格腦袋教授（Vincent　du　Viganeaud）所領導進行的那一隊，宣佈人造青黴素成功了！經過了無數次的失敗，碰了不知多少的壁，他們並不失望，並不灰心，也不怨天尤人。現在他們驕傲地看著那棕色的結晶體，亮晶晶地發光，他們也發出了勝利的微笑來。</p>
<p>我們知道現在的青黴素，至少有四種以上不同的刑別——F型，G型，K型，和X型。F型和K型青黴素，產量很少，應用無多；K型青黴素在人體內毀滅甚速（比他型快四倍），療效有限；市面上所流行的，類皆為G型青黴素。</p>
<p>G型青黴素的構造，可歸複雜。徵格腦袋所進行的方法，也正和普通的人工綜合法相似，先設法把他分解成較爲簡單的單位，想法子倣製出來，然後再設法把這簡單些的單位，合成復雜的整體。徵格腦袋教授是把G型青黴素分成dextro—penicillamine　hycrochlorice和2—benzyl—4—inethoxymethyleoe—（4）—oxazolone兩種稍為簡單的單位，然後，千廻萬轉，百折不撓，終於一步一步地製造成功了。</p>
<p>製造出來的東西，誠然具有抗菌的性能，但是具有抗菌性能的東西多的很，　並不　　明牠就是她—G型青黴素。</p>
<p>「不怕不識貨，只怕貨比貨。」科學家那有不明此　的道理，所以他們運用了放射性的原理，來個貨比貨，　爲壯觀，引間也不及細表。且說他們的原则，是把放射性的硫（Raoloactiyegulphur）拿來組合到這新藥品的分子裹去，再把牠們和自然界「青黴女士」所分泌的G型青黴素，混合起來，重新結晶，重新組合為一種化合物，這時，牠的分子裹所含的放射性硫，可以拿「Geiger測量器」來監測。假使牠們自己游離地跑走，那便不同於自然的青黴素了。然而牠們在窺測的一切過程中，始終忠實地追隨不捨。於是科學上證實了「二而一」了。</p>
<p>其次，怎樣把這綜合的青黴素提鍊成爲純粹的結晶體，他們所用的方法是採用兩種互不相融的溶劑，其中一種對於青黴素藥的溶解度較大，因而青黴素便逐漸集中到這個溶劑裹來，如是著重復若干次，最後，一小撮純粹的棕色的結晶體，——第一次的人種造青黴素，呈現在科學家的手掌中了。</p>
<p>這種人工人製造綜合，就經濟的立場而論，能夠和自然界競爭嗎？現在還不能。然而一切人工的綜合法，經過商業上的運用，總是最經濟的生產方法，所以在不久的將來，可能有廉價的青黴素，來普渡眾生！</p>
<p>可是記者認爲尤其重要的，是青黴素的人工綜合法成功之後之后，在化學上可能再發現若干有用的衍化物，正如百浪多息（Prontosil）之有若干種磺胺類衍化物，亦未可知。徵格腦袋教授笑了，記者也笑了，讀者也會笑吧。</p>

<h3>馬克吐溫與「跳蛙」</h3>
<p>— 黛玲</p>
<p>假使你看過「幽默大師」那張影片，對於其中「跳蛙競賽」的那一幕，你必會感覺興趣無窮。現在我想多和你來談一些跳蛙的故事。</p>
<p>雖然馬克吐溫在一八六三年僅寫下那只奇趣橫溢的「凱拉佛辣郡之著名跳蛙」的故事，但一直到一九二八年五月，美國人才真正地對它重視。從那時候始，大蛙的照片往往刋登於華盛頓報紙的首頁。一只著名青蛙之死亡，竟令萬人哀悼。</p>
<p>一九二八年五月，凱拉佛辣郡的人民，第一次組織了一個「國際跳蛙賽」，規定每年舉行一次。但因為馬克吐溫在他的故事中并未把跳蛙規則祥細敘述的緣故，他們不得不自行制定一些規律，居然成功了權威，延用至今。根據這些規律，青蛙須連跳三跳，最遠的便是冠軍。每只青蛙全部跳的時間是十秒鐘。地面上劃成好幾個圈，每圈相距三五尺，起跳點是圈的中心。（所以要劃圈者，蓋使旁觀者更容易算出蛙跳的遠近。）</p>
<p>第一跳時蛙主人可用棒或其他種種方法刺激青蛙前進，但第二及第三跳，卻絕不能有所作為，完全是聽天由命，靠青蛙自己的高興，而決定勝負。</p>
<p>蛙主人的聰明　在「跳蛙賽」舉辦十八年之中，蛙主人發明不少的機械物。有一個人製造了一根電棒，觸到蛙身時會發生一陣震動。但這并沒有什麼功用，青蛙抖了一陣後，竟然不高興競跳了。</p>
<p>有些人試用針藥和丸方，雖然目的在刺激，但常常使得蛙舒服非凡，而半途在圈子中睡起覺來。</p>
<p>另外一個人，事前很守秘密，輪到他跳的時候，他堅持把他的蛙留在匣中，因為它是被訓練做直接從匣中跳出來的。他把匣子放在圈中，打開蓋他的蛙飛般的躍出，竟然跳了四十尺-差不多打破三個世界冠軍加起來的紀錄。大家對於這只「超蛙」很為懷疑，調查之下，發覺匣底附有強力的彈簧，結果，那人被取消比賽資格，弄巧反而成拙。</p>
<p>青蛙要否訓練　很多人熱切討論跳蛙是否需要訓練的問題。有些贏的人說，假使沒有他們的關心訓練，斷然不能有那麼好的成績。但另外一些人卻會告訴你，他們從河底捕得了青蛙後，立刻趕往參加比賽，雖然一點沒有訓練，卻容容易易地獲得了錦標。</p>
<p>不論訓練有效與否，自從跳蛙變為有組織的運動之後，跳的距離確實日益增進。在早期比賽中，獲獎的青蛙祗跳三四尺遠，現在卻非十尺至十六尺不可。</p>
<p>去年一隻呌「瑪琪」的蛙，跳了十六尺二寸，造成新的世界紀錄。一九三七年，有人把一枚活蜜蜂喂給他的蛙，使它跳了二十一尺四寸。但是他仍沒有獲勝，因為那只蛙是往後面跳的。</p>
<p>某一次年賽舉行前一日，收到一隻竹簍，上面貼有籤條：「上下小心：火速。經「跳蛙賽」途中的跳蛙。」那隻簍裏滿裝西班牙泥土，有兩隻北加路林那蛙裝　其間。它們是華盛頓的救火總會從鐵路上運來參加比賽的。</p>
<p>輕敵者失敗了　平克勞斯貝特地空運一隻青蛙與賽，但那隻蛙大槪太趾高氣揚了，十秒鐘內竟然寸步不動。</p>
<p>有一個巴黎人，攜帶他的一對各重一磅半的法國蛙橫渡大西洋，穿過巴拿馬運河，再上溯太平洋而抵舊金山。內中一隻在「出寵」的時候，一躍而入舊金山灣，那痛心的主人形容它跳下的姿勢為「偉大」。另一隻蛙，痛失伴侶，無意受訓，結果一敗塗地，鎩羽而返。</p>
<p>十八年以來，凱拉佛辣成為了世界青蛙的中心地。感謝馬克吐溫那支筆，他使這項富有興趣的「運動」得以永久繼續下去，也使這嘈雜世界中，居然還存留下一些童心。</p>

<h3>偷着玩的嗎？</h3>

<h3>一關又一關</h3>
<p>— 方文</p>
<p>過陽曆年沒多久，又快過陰曆年了。</p>
<p>一歲過兩次年，這種重複的戲文在新舊思想混亂衝突的中國，隨處可見，豈獨過年已耳？</p>
<p>一歲過兩次年，在情緒上總覺有些重複和麻煩，有錢人多過一次年，多熱鬧一場，也未始不可，可是窮人就沒有這樣簡單，多過一次年，就多過一次難關。</p>
<p>人之一生，不知要經過多少難關，自從衝出娘門關入世以後，繼之就入學關考試關畢業關就職關，以至社會上到處碰壁，裁員關，失業關相　而來，再加上戀愛關結婚關疾病關，女子又多一重生育關，幾後直到老死，還要過一鬼門關，現在憑空每年又添上了兩次年關，人是血肉之軀，那能受得了這許多的難關呢？</p>
<p>因此，我每誦：「山中無日曆，寒盡不知年。」之句，輒為神往。</p>
<h3>世故老人談片</h3>
<p>— 殊響</p>
<p>世故老人，一現代之老人也；老人鼻架近視眼鏡，腮飄長髯，面貌清癯，而精神矍鑠，樣子與聖誕老人相近，年逾七十，猶健步如飛，日走通衢冷巷間，默察社會現狀，喜閱報章，國內國外各報，莫不訂閱，以獨具雙眼之新意，分晰辯證，日有所得，夜輒詳記之，積年累月，遂有談層數千書，滑稽幽默，兼而有之，節錄之以餉讀者。</p>
<p>老人讀報，見國共兩軍，爭奪漣水城，迨共軍敗退，國軍入城時，城中祗餘老嫗三人，行政院善救總署施救麺粉，竟無人接受；老人始而喟然，繼而欣然曰：「人之所難者為死之解脫耳，今解脫成績若是，使芸芸眾生，脫離凍餒之苦，實大善事也」！</p>
<p>老人有數友，服務教育機關，薪水甚薄，友過其居訴苦！老人從容謂之曰：「薪水者，原祗供購薪水者也，今名符其實，誰曰不宜」。</p>
<p>一抗戰夫人哭訴丈夫薄倖於老人之前，老人慨然謂之曰：「抗戰是臨時的，現在已終了，夫人可以休矣」。夫人憬然悟，嗒然而去。</p>
<p>老人讀論語至「古之學者為己，今之學者為人」句曰：「今之學者，誰不為己，誰謂今人不逮古人也」。</p>
<p>老人遊街，值某縣長過，驅從喧赫，路禁行人，老人昂首闊步，為××所執，老人大聲呵之曰：「縣長猶人也，余亦猶人也，吾何畏彼哉」！書未竟，××執之入屠，治以拘禁，老人始大悔曰：「吾悔不充縣長，致有此禍」！</p>
<p>某日，一××策騎過馬路，傷鄉嫗，嫗痛而哭，老人過謂之曰：「此馬路也，汝走馬路而遭馬傷，與馬何尤」？</p>
<p>老人見刧案蜂起，因笑話人曰：「此社會上有貧富二階級耳，使俱貧為盜，則盜不盜矣」。</p>
<p>元旦日，老人遊於街，見國旗飄揚，市容岑寂，路人若不知有元旦者然，老人見狀曰：「陽關易過，陰關難熬」。</p>
<p>老人見報紙廣告，載結婚離婚啟事甚多，內容多謂「我倆情投意合，願偕白首」，「我倆意見不合，難偕白首」，輒搖頭太息曰：「早知今日，何必當初」！</p>
<p>公教人員給薪微薄，勉黽從公，永無倦容，其他勞工報酬，高於一切，稍有不合，即以怠工相向，結果終如所願，人有詢老人消弭工潮之法者，老人屏左右而密語曰：「替勞工多讀幾年書，如公教人員，自無後患矣」。</p>
<p>某省男女合校，舊派側目，因造作無頭榜貼某校門曰：「妙妙妙，這大學真有成效，　等不到三年，會變成一座送子娘娘廟」。老人亦依原韻和之，末兩句曰：「妙妙，你說是男女不可同校，為何羅漢塑在觀音廟」？</p>
<p>老人一日偕西友遊街上，天雨泥潭，街中積泥諾田，西友詢路政何不修若是？老人答之曰：「今年天旱稻少，將來攬在街上種麥種稻」。有頃西友復指路傍樹上下掛青蟲，地上蟲驚及空中蛛網，意義何在？老人復答之曰：「這是昆蟲局的養蠶，因外國人造絲運華，將來用這些天然絲抵制」。西友始點頭讚稱：「中國不愧為注重農業的國家」。</p>
<p>老人之友，擬至郵局及救濟機關任事，其友詢老人二者何最不易致失業，老人勸之入救濟機關，友詢其理，老人指街上義丐語之曰：「此種工作，豈做得完的」？</p>
<p>老人曰：「在都市中，要審一青年，祗須呌他管理銀錢而不去查他的賬，到相當時候，就可置其死命矣」！</p>
<p>縣令某甲，自署門聯曰：「愛民如子，執法如山」。老人為續其下曰：「愛民如子，牛羊父母，倉廩父母，供為子職而已矣。執法如山，實藏與焉，貨財殖焉，是豈山之性也哉」。</p>
<p>老人與部隊長官寓，長官所用勤務，愚而　，室內有古式茶壺一，長官甚愛好之；一日囑勤務攜壺泡茶，良久，勤務攜無蓋壺至，長官責以何不將蓋蓋上，勤務以打碎對，長官怒曰：「何不連壺一同打碎」，勤務即取壺出外碎之，長官愈怒，遂杖責開革，老人聞之曰：「甚矣絕對服從之為難也」。</p>

<p>上海橫斷面</p>
<h3>水上叫化子（上）　水老鼠的前身</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>橫行在黃浦江上的「水老鼠」帮，提起了此馬來頭大。他們有着根深蒂固的歷史背景，踏浪翻波，活躍水底，都是他們的拿手好戲。從中偷竊船貨，擊破船艙，割斷鎬綻等等把戲，都是他們的家常便飯。最近雖經警局大爭摘捉，但因該帮神通廣大，靈材眾多，一時還談難全部肅清。查此帮「水老鼠」的前身，乃是活躍在三湘七澤間的「游五湖」，「戲青龍，」「水梳通」等帮口。在清季年間，已經在江湖帮中佔着一個重要地位了。為了要明瞭「水老鼠」的前身，等著不厭求釋地把　證所得縷述於後。</p>
<p>在當初，「游五湖」帮是盪着一種小船，專向着靠岸的「底子」（船也）行乞的「水上呌化子」，原屬於江湖帮「戲青龍」的一種。「戲青龍」是一種在水上獻技賣藝的一種帮口，這與獻技陸上的「獻天靈」帮異曲同工，不過和陸海軍一樣地分道揚鑣罷了。</p>
<p>「戲青龍」帮所盪的小舟，兩頭特小，中間膨漲得很大，形狀有如橄欖，也像個大鴨蛋。在白浪滔滔的長江上盪漾着，看來十分危險。船上一個老頭子，坐在後梢頭，握着一根小槳划着，船頭上站着一個年約十三四歲的孩子，男女都有，那孩子皆着一身緊緊的短衫褲，赤着雙足，頭上把頭髪挽了一個鵝角兒，插戲兩支紅綠花，那老頭子一邊打呼哨，一邊把船慢慢地盪進　堆裏。那別船裏的人，自然要一個個鑽出窗來瞧了。那老頭子便說了幾句「套頭」（開場白），喝了一聲起，那孩子便在那方寸大盈二尺的船頭上翻來覆去，做出諸種殲戲，那隻船跟着一邊一幌，危險萬分。如有人把錢拋在水裏，那孩子會立刻下水拾起。在清季吳縣中秋節石湖香會，「戲青龍」正是賺錢的當兒。不料每年總要死掉一兩個孩子，經過撫朱某出示禁止，「戲青龍」一行便受了打擊，以後才漸漸的減少，就有也散到別處去，不一定「趕集場」。平日只揀船碼頭那裏，做些雜技，博得一家子糊口錢，情況非常可憐。到那孩子已過十六歲，肢體變了生硬，不能再做這行營生，祗好改做「游五湖」的原因之一。</p>
<p>可是教孩子們練習「戲青龍」的技能，乃是一件非常困難的工作。因為要在一條船而且藤脆的木板上做「要猴」，「翻筋斗」，「倒鼎」（俗稱擊　子）「風圈」，（翻身成圈兒)等技藝而不傾跌，然後再練船上工夫，纔不致掉到水裏去，工夫都練會了，纔練水裏的本領。要在水裏睜得開眼，睜得到水裏的東西，所以能够在水裏「撈針」（拾錢），十個小孩當中能够練得成功的亦不過是一兩個。有的在練習的時候便死掉了！</p>

<h3>作家的成長</h3>
<p>— 復君</p>
<p>在文學範疇中，無論是創作，批評，或是編譯，要想有一個輝煌的不朽的成就，在十分之中，當然逃不了要　有幾分的天才和文學環境的熏陶，此外，首先就得要有堅強的毅力，這是一股偉大的動力，它可以促使作家走上成長之路。古今中外的文學家批評家就因為有堅強的毅力，結果無不有驚人的成功；那些神聖的傑作，即使在千百年以後，仍為大眾所愛不忍釋，視如珍寶，可說無不基於有堅強的毅力有以致之的。法國大文豪佛朗西（Anatole　France）在十多歲時，就開始他的文學生活，一直到一九二四年十月十二日死於都爾，前後享年八十歲，漫長的一生，對於文學工作專心一志，從不稍懈，這種堅強的毅力，實在可給今日許身於文學工作者以取法的。我國林琴南先生，以一個原來不懂外國語的古文家，因為於偶然之中，耳聽他人的口述，翻譯了一部法國文學家小仲馬著的茶花女遺事，得了無數人的歡迎與讚頌，因此引起他翻譯的興趣，先後譯了一百五十餘種的歐美各國名家的小說；凡英，法，美，俄，希臘，挪威，比利時，瑞士，西班牙，日本等國的名家，如莎士比亞，狄更司，史各德，大仲馬，小仲馬，華盛頓歐文，托爾斯泰，伊索，易卜生，威司，西萬提司，德富健次郞等的偉大作品，都被他譯為中文，介紹到中國來，他這種堅強的毅力，他這種始終不變的忠於文學的決心，實在令人欽敬的，</p>
<p>一個作家的成長，除掉要有堅強的毅力以外，就得要再有豐富的生活經驗。因為文學創作，原就是現實的各種生活的反映，如果沒有豐富的熱識的生活經驗，那這作家是不會有成就的。俄國短篇小說名家契訶夫有一次給他的友人蘇武林的信中說：「我所寫的只是我的經驗，……其所以你我出色的原因，就在你我喜歡與普通一般人接近」。著名的作家如陀斯妥夫斯基，曾流放於西伯利亞；高爾基從前做過拾破布者，機務打樣師的學徒，輪船上的助理廚師，律師的書記，并曾流浪各處。左拉為了要寫煤礦裏的情形，就親身到煤礦裏去。綏拉菲麼維支在他的我怎樣寫「鐵流」的一文裏，告訴我們如何獲得小說的材料，他這樣說：「我又找了那些同他一塊行軍過的同志們，我彷彿法官對詰似的去反問了一番；聽一個人說了以後，就去反問第二個，第三個，以至於第十個。後來我又得到一本日記，-是一個工人當這次行軍時候所記的日記，-於是，這麼一來，參考了親身參加過這次行軍者的陳述，我創造了一幅這次運動的真實的景片。塞　·鐵列捷珂夫在寫「鄧熙華」的時候，曾和這書的主人公一個新聞記者鄧熙華一塊兒工作了六個月。皮浬克為了寫「沃瓦河入到裏海裏」的一部小說，看了三十多本河海工程學的書籍。……這些事實，都正可以說明了一個作家的成長，除了堅強的毅力以外，還得要有深厚的人生經驗，否則，他的作品就不易做到形質俱美，膾炙人口的。</p>
<p>在一個作家的成長歷程中，旣然有了堅強的毅力和豐富的生活經驗，還得要隨時隨地知道「觀察」，知道「想像」。文學創作所描繪的對象旣是人生的現實生活，那麼對於人類各種各樣的姿態和個性，就得要以銳利的眼光，細心地去觀察它。高爾基在他的「我的創作經驗」中說：「為着要近於正確的去描寫一幅工人，神甫，小商人的肖像，必須好好地仔細去看他的千百個神甫，小商人，工人」。狄更司對於「觀察」最是銳敏，他無論走過怎樣熱鬧的大街，過後都能一一講出那條街上的店鋪的順序，以及它們是怎樣裝飾的種種情形。這都是作家對於「觀察」的實例。但我們知道觀察是屬於外界的，我們還得省察自己的內心，再體味到人類的個性和行為的相同點，藉此以描寫人物的思想感覺，衝動；這樣就得求助於「想像」了。托爾斯泰有一天和屠格涅夫在野外散步，看見一匹老驚馬走過，托爾斯泰立刻受到這匹馬的情意的感染，發生了強烈的「想像」，他於是異常生動地描寫了他的悲哀的回憶。再譬如我們從其他種種的人類的動作上，也都可以運用我們的「想像」，以達到文學作品深刻描寫的目的。所以「觀察」和「想像」，實在也是一個作家成長的不可少的重要因素。</p>
<h3>水車　（油畫）</h3>
<p>— 王蔚</p>
<h3>記俞平伯</h3>
<p>— 林慧</p>
<p>凡是一個中學生，大都讀過「槳聲燈影裏的秦淮河」那兩篇綺麗纏綿的文章，這便是昔年朱自清俞平伯兩人同遊秦淮時所寫的，而且成了膾炙人口的一段文壇佳話。</p>
<p>朱自清早已復員到平，由「回來雜記」可以看出他近來的心情。俞平伯一直隱居在古城，所以他的消息比較沉悶，雖然最近曾看見他發表在大公報的「詩餘散評」和「論語」的「清真詞淺釋」兩篇文章，但都是批評方面的著述，還很少能窺出他的生活和心境。</p>
<p>俞先生身材很矮，架着一副深度近視鏡，鼻烟色的舊呢帽滿積着塵土，藍布大褂已不知下過幾次水，誰最初認識他，都要驚奇他的樸素無華的。他微微有些駝背，步調不快不慢，十足的顯露出一種溫文儒雅的風度，要說他是舊文人氣息很深的一人，是一點也不過分的。</p>
<p>他無論說話或講書，常常用手指抓着那斑白的髪梢，這幾乎已成他的習慣。而最能傳露出他的心思和睿智的應是那雙灼灼有光的眼睛，它們發出一種理智的而且誠懇的光輝，從這裏可以懂得他的民族地區，可以默讀到比他文筆所能描繪的更其美麗的　想。</p>
<p>他是一個內向的人物，不喜高談闊論，總是沉浸於思想裏，他的沉默，往往使人起種崇敬的感情，覺得一切　華，誇大，吹噓都不免是一堆垃圾，一些累贅同時，他的喜好沉默，也說明了他的文章裏所以含蘊着許多幽深的哲理。</p>
<p>他是一位詩人，一位散文家。他的詩空靈自然；散文含蓄凝重，多多少少還帶點澁味，如果把朱自清比做公安派的袁中郎，那俞平伯正是鐘惺譚友夏。無論怎樣說，他早年寫出的「燕知草」，「雜拌儿」，不能不說是現代散文中最具風格的作品。其風格一半係於他的才華，一半也是由於他的人格完成的；這就是我們為什麼讀了某人的作品總希望再親眼看某人的原由。有的時候，我們從他的人格和生活方面觀察，反會得到更多的啟示的。</p>
<p>俞平伯離開新文學的崗位走向古典，這是人所皆知的事實，於是他給「論語」作考證，給周清真詞作淺釋，探討曲子的樂理和宮商，新的創作很少看見了；這是俞先生的寂寞，也是文壇的寂寞，如果走入古典是黑暗的八年裏的無可如何的逃避，那麼現在也該到了改弦更張的時候了，在這個動盪的大時代，年青的一羣，是多麼希望一些先進說出幾句真心話，作為他們精神的支柱；是多麼期待趨向真理的人，多射出一條光來刺破茫茫的黑夜……</p>

<h3>詩談片</h3>
<p>— 林風</p>
<p>詩是人類心的聲音，大地上有了人，也就有了詩。</p>
<p>詩在上古是一種大眾的藝術，後來才被一些文人雅士封鎖在溫室，而和大地人民隔絕，好像唯有他們才懂得詩，才配談，才配作，實在他們是把詩給沾污了，并給它帶上重重的枷鎖。</p>
<p>當時被文人囚禁時，人民間卻又響起一個龐大的聲音，那就是民歌。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　143</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>據說黑龍會的傳統傳說，會員臨死時候，無論是果非切腹，或是犯法自殺，都得喊上這個口號「恐急糾舉」，方才算得八弦一宇，驚天地泣鬼神的英雄勾當。不然的話，就得被人罵作「殺坯」，或「殺材」，那就與這御用的「聖死」法，卑怯得相去不可以道里計了。</p>
<p>此外，這四個字還有一種詮釋，那就是會中高級人物有了磨難，手下的人，一聽這個緊急命令，就得拼死向前，犧牲一切，在所不惜。只求保全這個高級人物。</p>
<p>以上三種詮釋，還不能概括一切，不過統而言之，這個黑話，多少是個不利的東西，好像與「死」的這回事，關聯得很緊。</p>
<p>那麼，鶴見所接受的，又是緊急命令的那一種呢？呌他趕緊切腹？還是呌他自殺？還是呌他拼死向前，去保護近衛？</p>
<p>「西原先生閣下」，鶴見站得挺直地，而且擺出了軍人的立正架子，「鄙人因為來時匆忙，沒有帶得傢伙，空手……」</p>
<p>鶴見固然知道這道緊急命令，大抵是個什麼涵養。可是，在這事變急劇，安危莫辨的倉卒中，也不能十二分拿得準，究竟這「恐急糾舉」，是否呌他去拼命。加之那位西原，天生的是一個雙料　吧長像，無論如何，面孔上不帶一絲表情。雖說來勢那般緊急火急，也不見得是搬救兵的。所以拿「沒有傢伙」的話來試探一下，看他怎樣答覆，就可把來意弄得一清二楚了：如要鶴見切腹，那照規矩，得用自己祖傳我國賜的倭刀；如呌自殺，他可冷笑一下，「請隨尊便」。除了這麼兩條，無論呌他用什麼傢伙，手槍，校刀，中國劍，等等，就可斷準，必是呌他殺敵致果。</p>
<p>「塔古桑，塔古桑！」這是日本字音，表示「多得很」的意思；那是說明別府的「傢伙」，各色各樣，應有盡有。「敵人的挑戰，指明柔道，或是劍道。相　這裏有上好的古劍，儘可挑選。」</p>
<p>鶴見這可完全明瞭了，不只明瞭，情緒也寗靜了；因為較量柔道劍道的話，原是鶴見計劃中的一段烟幕；可見近衛竟是着了他的道兒；換句話，就是中了計。跟進一步說，這麼一來，手下們對於搜尋「七封秘緘」的工作，竟是按計劃做到十分之七八了。還勝下的這十分之二三，就得他親自出場。</p>

<h3>The Government Eagerly Awaits the Realization of Peace, Willing to Sincerely Negotiate with the Chinese Communists, Hoping to Cease Conflict and Reorganize the Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department stated in a speech on the afternoon of the 9th: Since the successful conclusion of the National Assembly, the constitutional work has been completed, and the national construction plan can be actively carried out in accordance with the procedures decided by the National Assembly. The government's long-cherished wish to return power to the people can also be fulfilled. Therefore, the government is willing to sincerely negotiate with the Chinese Communists on specific measures for ceasing conflict and reorganizing the government, in order to realize peaceful reunification as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Lei Zhen returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 9th. After a short rest, he visited the Chairman at around 10:00 AM to report on the discussions with various parties in Shanghai. They talked for about an hour. He then visited Wang Shijie. That evening, he took a car to Shanghai at 11:00 PM and is expected to return on the 11th or 12th. He told reporters that the participation of various parties in the government and the resumption of peace talks are two separate matters. While in Shanghai, he exchanged opinions with Zhang Lan, Zhang Junmai, and others several times. The Democratic League advocates resuming negotiations first, but no concrete plan has been put forward. Within the Social Democratic Party, internal attitudes have not yet matured. Zhang Junmai is likely to come to Nanjing next week. Zhang Qun and Sun Ke may return on Sunday. Wu Tiecheng will remain in Shanghai to recuperate due to a minor illness.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Qun and Zhang Junmai had a meeting yesterday, the contents of which are unknown. However, Sun Baoyi, a spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party, told reporters that the Social Democratic Party is not absolutely opposed to participating in the government, but believes that peace talks should be resumed before the government is reorganized. Although this matter is very difficult, they still hope that the government will do its best, clearly state the limits of the negotiations, so that the government's sincere efforts to seek peace can be made clear to the world. Only when the domestic turmoil ends can the reorganization of the government have meaning. At the same time, before the government is reorganized, it should first implement various reforms within its power. For example, freedom of assembly and association must be fully guaranteed. Sun stated that Zhang Junmai's opinions to the government representatives would not go beyond the above two points.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang of the Youth Party, Zhang Junmai, Wu Xianzi, and Wan Renqian of the Social Democratic Party, visited Zhang Qun together at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to continue exchanging views on the reorganization of the government and other issues. The two parties are scheduled to hold a joint meeting today to formulate a common opinion, and then visit Zhang Qun tomorrow to further discuss based on this common opinion.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Zhang Lisheng said on the 9th that he had not yet studied Marshall's statement in detail, but believed that the United States' policy of hoping for peace and unity in China must remain consistent and that its policy toward China would not change. Regarding the reorganization of the government, the government is very eager for it. The participation of the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party is likely only a matter of time. Regarding the resumption of peace talks, the government will do its best if possible.</p>

<h3>Laws to Match the New Constitution Can Be Completed Within Six Months; The Ministry of Judicial Administration is Currently Studying Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A reporter recently met with Yang Zhaolong, Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and asked how the legal system would be coordinated with the implementation of the new constitution. He replied that the Ministry of Judicial Administration is currently conducting research on the following three matters: (1) How the legal system should be coordinated with the new constitution, such as issues related to the rights and obligations of the people, are all being planned. (2) The Chinese legal system was imitated from the West, and there are some aspects that are not suitable for China's national conditions or conflict with traditional Chinese concepts. We are currently trying to study and improve them. (3) The Ministry of Judicial Administration has now hired Professor Pound of Harvard University as a consultant to the Ministry. Professor Pound is a famous legal expert today. He visited China once before and has now accepted the invitation. The date of departure will not be far off. Professor Pound also suggested that the Chinese government try to complete a systematic legal masterpiece on China's current laws for the reference of all relevant parties. This matter is also being discussed in detail. The first two items mentioned above can be completed within six months, and the third item will probably take longer.</p>
<h3>The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association is a Research and Investigation Organization, Not Responsible for Actual Responsibilities</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Hong Lanyou said that the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association is expected to be established in the near future, but it is only a research and investigation organization and is not responsible for actual responsibilities. Branch associations will not be established in various provinces; only a standing committee will be established in the central government. It is also heard that government representatives will account for 60 members of the association, and Wu Zhihui may serve as the chairman. There will be three vice-chairmen, one each from Sun Ke, the Youth Party, and the Social Democratic Party. There will also be a secretary-general.</p>
<h3>Luo Longji Comments on Marshall's Statement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Luo Longji, a spokesperson for the Democratic League, formally commented on Marshall's farewell statement yesterday, praising Marshall as a "frank and sincere statesman" whose views were unique and worthy of being called China's "honest friend." However, there were also points of "disagreement." For example, the statement mentioned the end of the Kuomintang's tutelage, which he believed was "inconsistent with the facts." At the same time, Luo did not agree with Marshall's praise of the Chinese Constitution and the coalition government, and he criticized the government for undermining the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Finally, he believed that the failure of Marshall's mediation efforts over the past year was due to the contradictions in the US policy toward China itself, and he hoped that the new Secretary of State would "modify future policies toward China based on the wishes of the Chinese people."</p>
<h3>The Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party Praise Marshall's Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] After Marshall's statement was released, all parties attached great importance to it. The Standing Committee of the Youth Party met at 5:00 PM yesterday to conduct a thorough study of Marshall's statement. The Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party also discussed it.</p>
<p>Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Propaganda of the Youth Party, said that after reading General Marshall's statement carefully, we fully understand its meaning, recognize that it is quite profound and correct. We said the day before yesterday that the United States' policy toward China allows for considerable technical modifications, but the basic spirit will never change. Now, after reading the content of his statement, we know that our view is generally correct. Marshall's stay for a year has given him a full understanding of the overall situation in the world, especially in the Far East, and his judgment is particularly clear. This time, he has been appointed to the important position of Secretary of State, and we can anticipate that he will achieve something. Before the Political Consultative Conference, I exchanged views with Marshall on the plan drafted by the Youth Party at that time. The success of the Political Consultative Conference was largely due to Marshall's spiritual support. In this statement, Marshall emphasized the hope that we would implement this democratic constitution based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference, which shows that Marshall's views have been consistent from beginning to end, which is gratifying to us.</p>
<p>Sun Baoyi, a spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party, said: Marshall's statement is undoubtedly the best diagnosis of China's political illness. It pointed out that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference could have served as the basis for peaceful national construction. This basis has collapsed due to the obstruction and suspicion of some people in the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The hope for peaceful national construction lies in the rise of the moderate elements of the two parties and other enlightened elements. This understanding is quite accurate. The Social Democratic Party has always advocated democracy and will actively strive to realize democratic politics without lagging behind.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Military Personnel's Salaries, Increasing Allowances to the Same Amount as Civil Servants; Has Been Submitted to the Highest Authorities for Approval</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The competent authorities of the Ministry of National Defense have drafted two plans for adjusting the salaries of military personnel: (1) The special treatment of military personnel throughout the country will be based on the supply area. The Dihua area will increase by 100%, the Nanjing-Shanghai area by 80%, Zhengzhou and Kaifeng by 60%, the Wuhan area by 40%, and the Chongqing and Diankang areas by 20%. (2) This new salary adjustment will not be based on the supply area, except for Mongolia, Taiwan, and Xinjiang, where the currency value is significantly different. The increase rate will be uniform throughout the country, without salary increases, but with increased allowances. The increased amount will be equal to the salaries of civil servants and teachers, and physical objects will be issued. It is heard that the Ministry has submitted it to the highest authorities for approval. In addition, the food allowance for officers and soldiers throughout the country was 7,500 yuan in the 35th year, and some physical objects were issued. Now, due to soaring prices and the inconvenience of handling physical objects, the authorities have changed the food allowance to 15,000 yuan and implemented it from January of the 36th year.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Arrives in Beiping from Shenyang, Will Go to Nanjing Tomorrow to Report on the Situation in the Northeast; Negotiations to Take Over Dalian Will Begin Immediately</h3>

According to those around him, Xiong plans to stay for one day and fly to Nanjing on the 11th to report on his duties. Xiong denied the rumors of Liang Huasheng's resignation to reporters, saying that the Northeast Xingyuan has been reorganized and reduced to eight departments, and the number of personnel has been reduced to only one-third of the original.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] Negotiations to take over Dalian are still pending. Xiong Shihui told reporters today that the government has not yet taken over Dalian. It is learned that the national and communist armies near Dalian are still confronting each other in Pulandian. The diplomatic contacts between China and the Soviet Union in Andong are intermittent. The Northeast Diplomatic Commissioner's Office recently sent Xu Liqun, Director of the Second Department, to Andong to negotiate with the Soviet military authorities in North Korea on the sovereignty of the Shuifeng Power Plant, navigation on the Yalu River, and demarcation issues, but without results. Chiang Ching-kuo recently made a trip to the Northeast and will go to the Northeast again soon, which seems to be related to Northeast diplomacy.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] According to the Northeast Xingyuan Office in Nanjing, Xiong Shihui flew from Shenyang to Beiping at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. After arriving in Beiping, he consulted with local military and political leaders on important matters and will come to Nanjing in two days.

From Shihe south to Lushun and Dalian, there are about 100,000 Soviet troops and many communist troops.</p>
<h3>We Should Calmly Review Marshall's Advice; Shao Lizi Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Shao Lizi issued a statement on the morning of the 9th regarding Marshall's statement, saying that after Marshall leaves China, we should do our best to work for peace and democracy in order to fulfill the long-cherished wish of peace and prosperity.

<h3>Gu Zhutong Resigns from Concurrent Positions; Hu Zongnan Will Be Transferred to Director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, has been serving concurrently as Director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters for four months.

It is heard that the Chairman has approved the request. Hu Zongnan will be transferred to fill the vacancy of Director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters. After Hu takes office as Director of the Pacification Headquarters, it will be merged with the First War Zone Headquarters, and the First War Zone Headquarters will be abolished.</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Election Office Was Established in April of This Year to Handle Matters Related to the Election of National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The government will establish a National Assembly Election Office in April to handle matters related to the election of representatives. In addition, the Secretariat of the National Assembly is rushing to complete its work. During the transition period, the office's business may be handled by the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A person in charge of the Secretariat of the National Assembly recently stated that among the passengers who died in the plane crash in Qingdao on January 5th was Li Runshen. Recently, there have been rumors that Li was a National Assembly representative and that Ding Youmin replaced him at the conference. Therefore, the deceased was actually Ding Youmin, who was impersonating National Assembly representative Li Runshen. According to all the records in the association, Li Runshen was originally a National Assembly representative. However, before the opening of the conference, the Secretariat approved the notification from the National Assembly Election Office that Li should not be registered temporarily because there was an unsettled case. Therefore, Li Runshen never attended the conference from the opening to the closing. The rumors are obviously inconsistent with the facts.</p>

<h3>Ministry of National Defense Issues Statement Elucidating the Chinese Communist Army's Warmongering Intentions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A military spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense issued a statement saying: Since the issuance of successive ceasefire orders, no matter how the facts of the war caused by the Chinese Communist Army's attack on the National Army have evolved, no matter what the results of the battles on both sides, the Ministry has never published any war reports or promoted propaganda to exaggerate its own victories and exaggerate the losses of the Communist Army. Because the government is building the country and alleviating the people's difficulties, it is willing to make all kinds of concessions and compromises. Its desire for peace is extremely sincere. Therefore, it believes that party rifts and internal strife bloodshed, regardless of who wins or loses, are shameful and painful, and it cannot bear to publicize them superficially, let alone take the wounds of compatriots as a happy event. However, since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Communist Party has not been ashamed of the civil war, but has agitated propaganda and done its best to fabricate and exaggerate military affairs. This shows that the Communist Party has no sincerity in seeking peace in politics and has other unfathomable intentions in propaganda. Since the opening of the National Assembly, the Communist Party has repeatedly exaggerated its war results and fabricated losses of the National Army. According to its casualty reports, the National Army has long since ceased to exist. For example, in the war report issued by the Chinese Communist Party yesterday on the Battle of Southern Shandong, it listed the annihilation of the entire 4th Regiment of the Central Direct Traffic Corps. In fact, there has never been such a number in the National Army. It also claimed to have "captured Brigade Commander Che Fanru," but Che is currently the Deputy Director of the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Headquarters and is still seen safely coming to the Ministry to work. It also claimed that the national army suffered more than 27,000 casualties in this battle. Then the national army in the area has completely ceased to exist. Counting the days, the Communist Army should celebrate the occupation of Xuzhou. Why is it still struggling in the mud of Southern Shandong and coming so late? The above are just a few examples to reveal the essence of the Communist Army's past war reports, correct the public's hearing, distinguish between truth and falsehood, and clarify its warmongering atmosphere. In the future, in addition to expressing the utmost regret for disharmonious events in various places, it will not publish war reports.</p>

<h3>Marshall Arrives in Hawaii; Refuses to Make Political Statements; Chairman Praises General Deng as a Man of Action and Few Words</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Honolulu, 9th] Marshal Marshall, returning to the United States from China to assume his new position as Secretary of State, arrived here by plane today. It is said that he will stay in Hawaii for a few days before going to Washington. Five minutes after Marshal Marshall disembarked, he and his wife left the airport by car. When asked by reporters, he declined to make any political statements, replying: "If reporters wish to meet with me, I will receive them, but I have no statement to make."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Special Envoy Marshall, summoned by President Truman, left Beijing on the morning of the 8th to return to his country. The special envoy arrived in Shanghai on December 20, 1945, under orders, and flew to the capital after the victory on the 21st to meet with Chairman Chiang. He arrived in Chongqing on the 22nd and began working towards peace and unity in China, striving to promote the Political Consultative Conference and the issuance of the ceasefire order, and assisting in the establishment of the Military Mediation Executive Department's military three-person group. On February 15, the "Basic Military Program" was signed in Chongqing. In March, the special envoy accompanied government representative Minister Zhang Zhizhong and CCP representative Zhou Enlai, traveling tirelessly to Zhangjiakou, Jining, Gui Sui, Taiyuan, Jinan, Xuzhou, Hankou and other places to thoroughly implement the ceasefire order. On June 7, he facilitated the issuance of the order to cease conflict in the Northeast. In July and August, the special envoy worked tirelessly to mediate peace, climbing Mounts 儿上. The special envoy also indirectly commanded the U.S. military stationed in China to complete the arduous task of repatriating Japanese prisoners and residents. The special envoy arrived in China on December 7 of the year before last and left yesterday. Apart from returning to his country once last March to report on his duties, he stayed in China for a total of thirteen months. Over the past year, due to wartime destruction and more than a year of domestic turmoil, transportation was blocked and the economy was in peril. During this period, Marshal Marshall worked tirelessly to solve these problems. President Truman stated in his China policy statement on December 18 of last year that "Marshal Marshall's experience and wisdom are sufficient to help China make its own efforts to solve these problems." The special envoy's achievements will be forever remembered by the Chinese people. What is particularly commendable is the understanding and friendship between Chairman Chiang and the special envoy personally, which their wives also shared. Marshal and Mrs. Marshall celebrated Christmas twice with the Chairman and his wife after the war. The Chairman also accompanied them on walks and excursions to the Xia Ying Kuang Ying and Taihu Lake to avoid birthdays, allowing the beautiful scenery to complement the outstanding individuals. The Chairman once praised the special envoy as: "The General is a great man of action and few words." He is focused on practicality rather than formality. He has quick decision-making skills, noble goals, and keen insight, and is truly a model of an outstanding military man. As the special envoy returns to his country to take up the post of Secretary of State, the people of his country have high expectations for his mission and firmly believe that his outstanding talents and character will make a great contribution to world peace.</p>

<h3>National Army Close to Giant City, Only Twenty Li Away; Shuyang Can Be Recaptured Any Day; Fierce Fighting Still Ongoing in the Jiangsu-Shandong Border Area</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] After the National Army recovered Machang Town, it continued to advance. Xiaowangji and Lizhuang, only 20 li away from Shuyang, were recovered by the National Army last night. Gunfire was incessant in Shuyang city all day yesterday, reportedly due to internal strife within the Communist army. The city can be taken any day. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Huaiyin: The National Army in Lianshui, in order to crush the Communist army's attempt to invade southwards along the Tongyu Line, completely defeated the Communist army at Dongshunhe this morning at dawn.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] Military news: The Communist army that fled from Shuyang to Lincheng in southern Shandong, and the Communist army that fled from Su to Yaowan in Pi County, are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. As of last night, Yaowan was still in the hands of the National Army, and Lincheng is currently in a state of confused fighting. Furthermore, Yixian is currently surrounded by the Communist army. The Communist army once forced its way into the South Gate and outside the Canglang Gate of Yixian. After the National Army bravely resisted and killed or wounded one Communist battalion commander, the offensive was slightly frustrated. It is reported that fierce battles are still raging between Zaozhuang and Yixian. It is learned that among the Communist army in southern Shandong, not only are Japanese artillerymen assisting in the fighting, but there are also many newly manufactured heavy machine guns. The Communist army's plan is clearly to seize several important strategic strongholds in the Jiangsu-Shandong border area, besiege Yixian, Xiangcheng, Lanling, and Taierzhuang, in order to threaten Xuzhou and thereby rescue the Communist army in Funing and Shuyang, which are already heavily besieged by the National Army. Therefore, they are taking great risks and fighting fiercely with the National Army. However, according to military figures who recently arrived here from northern Jiangsu, the center of gravity of the current war situation has shifted to southern Shandong. The Communist army intends to avoid strength and strike at weakness, so it has launched a widespread and large-scale offensive in southern Shandong, using a force of approximately three divisions, almost making a desperate gamble. This is different from the Communist army's past style of solely preserving strength. If they do not change their course soon, they will encounter unprecedented bad luck within ten days, because General Xue Yue and General Wu Qichuan, who has now personally arrived at the front to supervise the battle, are fully aware of the Communist army's conspiracy to launch a large-scale invasion. The war situation in the Jiangsu-Shandong border area has reached a critical juncture, and the outcome will be known within three days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] Six divisions of the Communist army launched a new offensive against the National Army on the Taizao branch line. After the National Army put up a strong resistance in Yixian, Zaozhuang, and Taierzhuang, they suffered heavy losses. The war situation on that line has turned into a stalemate.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 8th] Around Xigang and Sunjiazai on the border of Teng and Pei, more than 8,000 Communist troops sneaked in on the 8th. Furthermore, at Wangkou and Mankou, two ferry crossings on the important shore of Weishan Lake, the Communist army is currently concentrating more than 200 wooden boats and is conscripting stretcher bearers and civilians in Jisuo Town, plotting to stir up trouble.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] While the National Army in Guoyang was being transferred, the 7,000-strong Communist army of Zhang Taisheng in northern Jiangsu seized the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on the 7th evening.

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] The Third and Seventh Columns of the Communist army of Liu Bocheng in southwestern Shandong, after capturing Juye and Jiaxiang, advanced to attack Jinxiang, attempting to develop towards the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and threaten Xuzhou. The National Army stationed in Jinxiang once issued an alarm, but after a certain unit of the National Army arrived and launched a costly counterattack, the Communist army was defeated, Jinxiang was relieved, and the Communist army's attempt to peer southwards was thwarted. Currently, the Communist army in that area has retreated northwards, and its vanguard has reached the area between Fan County and Shou Zhang. It is also learned that the Communist army is actively operating along the old course of the Yellow River, apparently attempting to breach the dyke southwest of Juan County. Because the project to restore the dyke of the Yellow River at Huayuankou has been completed and the river water has returned to its old course, the Communist army may breach the opening southwest of Juan County, causing the Yellow River to flood southwestern Shandong and inundate the National Army in that area.</p>

<h3>Discussing the Yellow River Damming and Restoration Problem; Dong Biwu Visits Egerton; Headwaters of the Old Course Pass Kaifeng and Flow East</h3>
<p>[By the Central Agency in this city] CCP representative Dong Biwu visited General Egerton, head of the UNRRA branch office, at nine o'clock yesterday morning after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to discuss the Yellow River damming and restoration problem, and did not leave until around twelve o'clock. The two sides continued to hold talks in the afternoon. The formal meeting will have to wait until the arrival of Huo Baoshu, director of the Executive Yuan, and Todd, chief engineer, in Shanghai?</p>
<p>In addition to Egerton and Dong, those who participated in the talks yesterday included Davis, Bokennan, and Hansen from UNRRA, and Lin Zhong, Zhao Mingfu, Wang Xiaoyi, and Cheng Run from the CCP side. During the meeting, Dong Biwu raised two points of opinion and requested (1) to stop damming the opening (2) to speed up the dike restoration project. General Egerton believed that he could be responsible for informing the Huayuankou Engineering Office to stop releasing water, but the cessation of damming and dike restoration would have to be jointly considered with the government and the relevant mine bureaus.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th] After the CCP raised objections to the Huayuankou diversion channel releasing water, the Damming and Restoration Bureau, in order to make the actual situation of the CCP obstructing the damming more clear to all parties, consultant Todd went to Shanghai to specially meet with Guan Zhenxing, the director of the engineering office sent by UNRRA, and went to Beijing to report to the Water Conservancy Commission separately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 8th] After the old course of the Yellow River was diverted, it reached Huanggangkou at twelve o'clock noon on the 3rd, crossed the Bianxin Railway line at 6:20 a.m. on the 4th, and crossed the Bianxin Highway at 6:40 a.m. At 2:30 p.m. on the 5th, it flowed to Nanchen Village, eight li east of Chenqiao on the north bank, with an average flow rate of a little more than one li per hour. At 10 p.m. on the 5th, it flowed to Fuyin Temple, about ten li northwest of Sao Tong. At 8 a.m. on the 6th, it flowed three li past Junheji (thirteen li northeast of Sao Tong), with a water width of 25 meters and a depth of about 2 centimeters, and a faster speed. At 2 p.m. on the 6th, it flowed to Guantai, with a water width of about 50 meters and a depth of about 2 meters, and a speed slightly slower than walking. After the headwaters passed, the water flow gradually became turbulent. In the Fuyin Temple area, the water is currently 80 meters wide and 1 meter deep.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai's Unreasonable Demands</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 8th: Zhou Enlai issued a serious statement on the Yellow River damming problem. The full text is 1,400 words long.

It is also required that the dangerous sections be rectified and straightened during dike restoration, and that the opening can only be dammed and water released after the entire project is completed.</p>
<h3>More Than 100,000 Opium Addicts in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Central Government Sends Personnel to Supervise Prohibition</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] Zhu Weizhen, special envoy for the Guangdong-Fujian area prohibition, recently told reporters that Guangdong Province was the earliest place for opium to be imported, and was later influenced by the enemy and puppet's policies of poisoning the people, resulting in a deep-rooted problem of opium. According to investigations, there are 34 counties in the province that grow opium, and there are more than 100,000 opium addicts in the entire province. In Guangzhou City alone, there are more than 20,000. In the past, Guangdong Province also had opium prohibition plans, but they were mostly not handled in accordance with central government laws and regulations, resulting in no results. Therefore, the central government specially sent Zhu to Guangdong to supervise. According to Zhu, opium in the Guangdong area will be completely cleared within one year.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Deputy Police Superintendent Shoots and Wounds Our Shepherd Boy While Hunting</h3>
<p>Wang Lai's Father Appeals for Assistance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 9th] On December 26, Hong Kong Deputy Police Superintendent Lucas Khan went hunting near Zongling in the New Territories and fired a shot into the jungle. It happened that there were five shepherd boys herding cattle nearby. One of the boys, named Wang Lai, 13 years old, was suddenly hit by a bullet and injured his left arm bone. He was later sent to the hospital by the police for treatment and has not yet been discharged. Wang Lai's father, Wang Si, has already submitted a petition to the Hong Kong Office of the External Affairs Commissioner's Office in Guangdong and Guangxi, requesting negotiations with the Hong Kong government, and issued an open letter to all sectors of Guangdong, appealing for justice and assistance. The Hong Kong government's information office told reporters on the 8th that an accident did occur that day, but the truth will only be released after a detailed report is obtained from the relevant authorities. According to Lucas Khan, the incident was purely an accident. He fired a shot into the jungle that day, but only learned of the accidental shooting of the shepherd boy when he returned to the police station.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Supplies Awaiting Shipment to China Valued at Over $200 Million USD; Rooks Report Says Shipments Will Be Expedited</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 8th] UNRRA Director General Major General Rooks issued a report today, stating that as of January 1, UNRRA had shipped 19,257,970 tons of supplies, valued at approximately $2,281,759,000 USD, completing 78% of the entire plan. In order to end UNRRA as soon as possible, the remaining 6 million tons (valued at approximately $661,949,000 USD) of supplies will be shipped in the near future. Among the supplies not yet shipped, China will receive $269,119,000 USD, the Philippines $4,525,000 USD, and Korea $822,000 USD.</p>
<p>Regarding the China portion, Rooks said: "Forty percent of the supplies we have not yet shipped will be shipped to China, as only half of the supplies to China have been shipped. Our work in China started a few months later than in Europe. In addition, the congestion at Chinese ports forced us to suspend shipments (except for food), which was also one of the reasons for the delay. The steps implemented in July were very effective, and most of the embargo on supplies has been lifted. What has not been shipped is limited to items that are not easily distributed. We have provided more than 200 landing craft and other ships to the Chinese authorities, making the distribution work smoother. We will continue to provide China with 60 ships.</p>
<p>At the beginning, UNRRA's work in China was extremely difficult, due to the vastness of the area, the difficulty of transportation, and China's own administrative problems. UNRRA's distribution of supplies is equal to all, and does not allow any discrimination based on race or political views. In order to comply with this policy, UNRRA has tried to ship supplies to Communist areas in a fair proportion. However, due to the civil war, these efforts have not been effective. UNRRA is now doubling its efforts, hoping to reach an agreement with the KMT and the CCP so that a large amount of supplies can be shipped to Communist areas. According to recent reports, this effort has achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>UNRRA's food relief provides great assistance to the famines in the disaster areas of China, despite the difficulties of transportation. UNRRA's post-war assistance provides assistance to Chinese industry, and UNRRA's technical personnel are also of great help to the restoration of Chinese industry and agriculture. UNRRA has made great contributions to the reconstruction of railways and inland waterways. Although UNRRA's work is now focused on post-war recovery, it is hoped that under a greater plan, the effects of its current unfinished work will exceed 1946."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for Marshal Ma's Appointment as Secretary of State</h3>
<p>The news of Marshal Marshall's return to the country to serve as Secretary of State has been well received by both the Chinese and American governments and the public. The US Senate unanimously approved it on the 8th, with not a single dissenting vote, which is a rare phenomenon in American political history. The new Senate President Vandenberg and the former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Connally jointly drafted a bipartisan American foreign policy with Byrnes. They praised Byrnes's achievements over the past year and a half. However, they all believe that Marshall is the most suitable candidate to take on the role of Secretary of State. Time magazine praised Byrnes as a great man of 1946, and Marshall is truly a great figure in modern American history. It is certainly regrettable that Marshall was unable to accomplish his mission in China and had to leave China to serve as Secretary of State. However, this does not mean that Marshall will no longer be involved in Chinese politics. Moreover, we believe that after Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, there will be greater hope for accelerating the completion of his unfinished great cause in China.</p>
<p>Marshall was ordered by President Truman to be an envoy to China to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It has been exactly eleven months. During this period, Marshall has been in constant contact with all parties and has silently observed the evolution of the situation in China and the Far East. He not only knows the political situation in China and the common wishes of the 450 million people of the country, but also understands the crux of the Far Eastern situation. With his extraordinary wisdom and his victorious strategies, he failed to accomplish his mission of mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and bringing peace to China. This cannot be regarded as Marshall's personal failure. We have studied the reasons why the internal strife in China has not stopped. There are many factors. Marshall's memorandum to the US State Department before leaving China has already explained it in detail. However, we always believe that the nature of the China problem is not simple, but a very complex and subtle problem. It is inevitable that the authority of the President's special envoy alone to seek a solution to the China problem will be exhausted and cannot be planned in a comprehensive manner to seek a fundamental solution. However, after Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, American foreign policy will be completely under his control. Marshall will be able to use it freely, and there will be many conveniences for solving the China problem. Although Marshall himself is not in China, Ambassador Stuart is in China and can continue to mediate. There are rumors that Ambassador Stuart is about to resign. We do not believe it because Ambassador Stuart's mission to China was the result of Marshall's recommendation to the President. His main task is to assist Marshall in carrying out mediation work. He has made great contributions to Marshall's understanding of China. Now that Marshall still wants to solve the China problem, he cannot be without Ambassador Stuart's assistance. Only one person in the United States can preside over the major policy direction, and one person in China can mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, can there be hope of success.</p>
<p>We have always believed that the China problem is a part of the Far East problem. The clarification of the Far Eastern situation will be of great benefit to the solution of the China problem. Looking back and looking ahead, it is not difficult to prove that since the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the Second United Nations General Assembly have successively closed, European international politics has achieved a peaceful trend, and there have also been signs of improvement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, the Far Eastern situation is still unclear, and the improvement of US-Soviet relations has not yet materialized. The world's attention will be focused on the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference in March this year, and everyone has great hopes. British Army Chief of Staff Montgomery is currently visiting senior Soviet military and political officials in Moscow, and the atmosphere between Britain and the Soviet Union has greatly eased. Former Labor Party Chairman Laski, who visited the Soviet Union, also declared that the Soviet Union does have peaceful intentions. Based on this, it is not difficult to dispel the suspicions between Britain and the Soviet Union. As for between the United States and the Soviet Union, President Truman also spoke of US-Soviet cooperation in his message to the Eightieth Congress. After Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, he will naturally inherit the President's will and try to expand the achievements of the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the Second United Nations General Assembly to seek an improvement in US-Soviet relations. We still remember that during the war, Marshall, in his capacity as the US Chief of Staff, had frequent contacts with senior Soviet military and political officials. When the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Potsdam, Marshall personally met with Marshal Stalin. Therefore, with Marshall's past experience and his feelings for the Soviet Union, it is not difficult to improve the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Moreover, when Marshall was in China, he silently observed the core issues of the Far Eastern situation and paid attention to the movements of the Soviet Union at all times. As the saying goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle," which has always been Marshall's motto. Therefore, we believe that the first step Marshall will take in diplomacy after taking office will be to try to improve US-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>As for the American policy toward China, there will be no major changes. However, Marshall knows the national conditions of China, understands the wishes of the people of the whole country, and is very clear about what China urgently needs at the moment. In short, it is nothing more than the eight characters "peace, unity, democracy, and nation-building." "Peace and unity" still require the efforts of all parties to strive for, while "democracy and nation-building" have taken their first major step. A practical and feasible democratic constitution has been passed by the National Assembly and promulgated by the government, and will be implemented from December 25 this year. Although it is still the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, the Kuomintang's period of political tutelage can be regarded as having become a thing of the past. Moreover, expanding the foundation of the government and recruiting representatives of various parties and social elites to participate will soon be realized. If the United States wants to help China build a country and revive, then it is time to provide active material assistance.</p>
<p>In his memorandum to the State Department, Marshall also set out the economic situation in China, which has been destroyed by the Communist Party and has fallen into a very serious situation. If the United States provides material assistance at this time, it will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. What China urgently needs at the moment is to restore the national transportation system and to revitalize industry and commerce. The completion of these two ends depends on the assistance of friendly countries. Therefore, we hope that the US authorities do not have to wait until peace is truly restored. At this moment, it can assist China in moving towards the bright road of nation-building. We believe that Marshall can understand this feeling that we have.</p>
<p>In short, after Marshall returns to the country to take office, the focus of American foreign policy will be concentrated on the Far East. We hope that Marshall will have a long-term vision and, on the one hand, improve US-Soviet relations, restore the spirit of mutual trust and mutual assistance during the war, and jointly devote himself to the creation of peace, so that the Far Eastern situation can also be clarified. On the other hand, he will actively assist China in laying the foundation for China's democratic nation-building. By taking these two-pronged approach, we will surely be able to seek a fundamental solution to the China problem in order to accomplish Marshall's unfinished great cause in China.</p>
<h3>How to Reorganize Personnel</h3>
<p>Personnel administration is one of the most unsatisfactory problems at present. Generally speaking, its weaknesses are four: first, there are too many staff members; second, the general level is too low; third, the salaries are too low; fourth, the turnover rate is too high; fifth, the efficiency is too poor. And these weaknesses are mostly mutually causal. Because the salary is too low, it is impossible to find suitable talents, so the level is low. Because the level is low, the efficiency is poor, and the number of staff members cannot be too many. Because the efficiency is poor, it is necessary to adjust it from time to time, so the turnover rate is high, and the staff members have no guarantee.</p>
<p>The key to the problem lies in the fact that the salary is too low and the position is too insecure. However, in addition to these two reasons, there are many objective conditions that can contribute to the complexity and chaos of personnel. One is too much formalism. For example, if you want to promote a certain system, you don't ask about the actual situation, you just want to be neat and unified, and promote it uniformly in order to achieve consistency. Suppose there is a certain agency. Including the director and the staff members, there are only two staff members in total, but because it is also considered an agency, according to the regulations, the accounting agency must send an accountant. Before the military uprising, the construction funds of a certain county were only more than 10,000 yuan, but a construction bureau had to be established. According to this method, how can there not be more redundant personnel? How can the number of staff members not be large?</p>
<p>The second is too many tricks. As long as the name is novel and in line with the times, no matter what the financial conditions are, it will be copied out. If anyone holds a different opinion, he will be given the crime of destruction or devastation, so that he has nothing to say. Therefore, all kinds of signs can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys, and even in remote rural areas. Of course, there are many of them that are just half-filled and half-hungry, raising a few idlers, which is actually not a few.</p>
<p>Third, there are too many supervisors and ordering agencies. Each is based on its own duties, each is in charge of its own scene, and they go their separate ways and issue orders indiscriminately to show their efforts. The lower-level agencies dare not fail to comply with them because of their position. As a result, there are more and more signs, and more and more people are used. As for whether the funding is available and how the performance is, that is another matter. It is good to make a few forms and report a few numbers. There is always a way. Some people think that all agencies now have central tasks, and this situation should be able to be improved. However, they do not know that those competent authorities have each ordered their competent matters to be included in the central work. We know that in many places, although the finance is nominally unified revenue and expenditure, in fact, there are clear boundaries between this territory and that territory. Any money designated for buying salt is definitely not allowed to buy oil. The so-called central work is only paid special attention to when handling it. In fact, it is still not easy to see a comprehensive plan and weigh the urgency. Therefore, redundant agencies and redundant personnel are still impossible to cut.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we really want to cut redundant personnel and eliminate waste, we believe that first, the local competent officials must be able to grasp the overall situation, use their subjective judgment to distinguish the urgency, and formulate appropriate administrative policies. Do not deal with it casually, creating a chaotic situation. Second, the number of staff members and Xie Ge in each agency must have considerable flexibility, so that the responsible personnel can consider the situation and make practical and appropriate decisions. Do not follow the same pattern, be too rigid, so that usable people cannot be used, and people who must be used cannot be used. We believe that this is the necessary way to reorganize personnel.</p>
<h3>International Food Conference Allocates Rice; We Receive More Than 240,000 Tons; Only 35 Percent of the Requested Amount</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] The International Emergency Food Conference today allocated 245,000 metric tons of rice to China for the first half of 1947, which is only 35% of China's request for 800,000 tons. The conference said that during that period, the supply of rice was only enough to meet 35% of the requests of various countries and countries in urgent need. Chen Zhimai, the Chinese representative to the conference, declared that of the rice allocated to China, 100,000 tons would be taken from Siam, 33,000 tons would be taken from Vietnam, 100,000 tons would be taken from Burma, and 12,000 tons would be taken from the United States. The conference also allowed Chinese rice merchants in Siam to continue to ship rice to China, with the following percentages allocated in the total amount: If the rice shipped from Siam since last October exceeds 50,000 tons, then 5% is allocated, 6% if it exceeds 60,000 tons, 7% if it exceeds 80,000 tons, and 8% if it exceeds 100,000 tons. Chen Zhimai said that China can obtain another 24,000 tons of rice within the first three months, which is repaid by the United Kingdom. During these six months, China can allocate a large amount of wheat and flour.</p>

<h3>Wujin's Industry and Commerce Declining; Factories and Stores Closing Down One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wujin News] Due to the continuous passive increase in prices, the unrelenting pressure of commercial loans, high labor costs, expensive raw materials, and slow sales, the entire industrial and commercial sector has been in a slump for the past year.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] Cheng Zimin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Bureau, returned to the province after inspecting Northern Jiangsu. According to him, the clearing of land in the Northern Jiangsu Pacification District, according to the central government's regulations, all land illegally disposed of by the Communist Army is nationalized. However, after the provincial government officials returned from inspecting the recovered area, they felt that such measures were also difficult in practice.

<h3>Repairing the Jiangnan Highways - Progressing Step by Step</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] The highways in various parts of Jiangnan were severely damaged during the war, and few have been repaired to date.

<h3>Suzhou Banks to Aid Industry and Commerce - Establishing an Emergency Loan Consortium - Allocation of Interest Rates and Underwriting Methods Yet to Be Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] In light of the crisis in local industry and commerce, which is as imminent as fire singeing one's eyebrows, the Suzhou government, despite the County Chamber of Commerce's several desperate pleas for loans, has seen no concrete results, leading to delays and potentially disastrous consequences.

<h3>Hao County Party, Government, and Military Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>Resolved to Form City Defense Teams and Village Clearing Teams</p>
<p>[Our Hao County Dispatch] The joint meeting of the Party, government, and military in the county has been organized in accordance with the organizational methods of the joint meeting of the Party, government, and military in the pacification zone.

<h3>Bengbu's Traitor Trials - 270 Cases Concluded</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch] Since the victory, the traitor trials in this area, according to recent statistics from the First Branch of the Anhui Higher Court, from New Year's Day last year to the end of December, have received a total of 411 cases of traitors, of which 270 have been concluded, and 141 have not been concluded. Among those that have been concluded, only Ni Daolang, the former Governor of Anhui Province, was sentenced to death. According to Xu Jiaguan, the President of the First Branch of the Higher Court, although the major traitor Ni Daolang has been sentenced to death, according to regulations, it must be submitted to the Supreme Court for a retrial, which has not yet been concluded. Tang Shaohou, the former Director of the Finance Department, has a complicated case, [illegible], [illegible], [illegible], [illegible], [illegible] After the sentence, the Red Swastika Society and people involved in the Tong Zhi case argued that although Ni had communicated with the enemy and betrayed the country during the period when Bengbu was captured, he was a member of the Taoist sect, and his philosophy was kindness. Therefore, he did not commit any major evils, and many people interceded on his behalf to reduce the sentence. The Supreme Court's delay in sentencing may be due to this. Judging from the current situation, it is possible that Ni may have his sentence reduced to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing County Political Conference - Decided to Use Grain</h3>

<h3>Lu'an County Council - Reviewing the County-Level Budget</h3>
<p>[Our Lu'an Report] The County Council convened a temporary meeting of councilors from various townships to review the county budget for the 36th year. Chairman Pan presided over the meeting. The total county revenue was reviewed as 1,681,264,000 yuan. The education sector, in accordance with provincial regulations, accounted for 30%, or 525,000,000 yuan, plus an additional 20,000,000 yuan as a subsidy for school maintenance expenses. Regarding the salaries of county-level personnel, it was decided that salaries would be increased by a factor of 360, and living subsidies would be 60,000 yuan. The salaries of township-level personnel would be increased by a factor of 240, and living subsidies would be 35,000 yuan. The salaries of village-level personnel would be increased by a factor of 160, and living subsidies would be 25,000 yuan. Public expenses would be increased by a factor of 3. Regarding local historical and cultural work, the organization of the Historical and Cultural Committee should be strengthened, with two full-time group leaders, eight members, and three employees to facilitate the work. Regarding loans for college students, the first third plenary session of the Council had previously resolved to allocate 10 million yuan in US dollar bonds as a fund to generate interest. However, these bonds have not yet been cashed, and the current loan is not available. It was decided that the full amount of 6 million yuan in compensation in arrears from former director Wu Huaide of the field management office should be used. Therefore, the total county revenue is 1,683,640,000 yuan, with a balanced budget. The county government has reported the county budget to the provincial government for approval.</p>

<p>Please Restore the Telegram Distribution Offices</p>
<p>It has been more than a year since the victory, and everything should be on the path to reconstruction. But looking at the telegrams, there is always a large crowd of people lined up in front of the telegram office, and it is even more crowded inside. Once, I tried to send a telegram to Zhengzhou, and after waiting in line from 3:00 PM, I still couldn't get to the window by nightfall. It wasn't until the next morning that I was able to send it. What if someone had a sudden illness and needed to call a doctor or family from another city? Wouldn't that be a disaster?</p>
<p>If you take a chance and think you can send the telegram earlier by going to the various receiving offices, they either tell you to go to the main office or say that they don't accept telegrams here. I don't know what the point of establishing these receiving offices is!</p>
<p>Not moving forward but at least not moving backward is acceptable (although telephone reception and transmission are also hindered). To avoid this congestion, it is best to restore telegram reception at the distribution offices, so that they are worthy of their name. (Zhang Chengyu)</p>
<p>Questions Regarding Combined Property Tax Calculation</p>
<p>Recently, the Finance Bureau sent property tax and municipal tax payment forms, which I believe are extremely unfair. I live in Jingyuan, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road. There are 34 buildings in this lane, which the Finance Bureau has classified as Grade C. In the 26th year of the Republic, the rental value of each building was estimated at 528 yuan. I live in buildings 5 and 6 in Jingyuan, and each building should pay 26,400 yuan in autumn property tax and municipal construction tax. However, the autumn property tax and municipal tax payment forms issued by the Finance Bureau combine the rental values of the two buildings and forcibly classify them as Grade B, ordering me to pay 79,200 yuan, which unfairly increases my burden. I really cannot accept this. Furthermore, the Finance Bureau's property tax forms for the winter of last year and the spring and summer of this year were calculated separately for buildings 5 and 6, in two copies, and were not combined. This can be used as evidence. I specially urge the Finance Bureau to review this and grant a correction. (Wang Bingzheng)</p>
<p>A Primary School Teacher's Heartbreaking Words</p>
<p>I am a teacher at a municipal central primary school, with a monthly salary of 200,000 yuan. I have to support a family of five. I have an elderly mother with white hair, and young children below me. Most of my usual expenses are covered by borrowing from relatives and friends, or selling broken items from my home to get by. Now the weather is getting cold. When I get up in the morning, the frost on the roof tiles has thickened a lot, but we are still wearing these thin, tattered old cotton clothes. All the belongings at home have been sold out, and I am too ashamed to go to relatives and friends to borrow again. My mother has caught a cold and is coughing, and the children are shrinking on the bed all day because of the cold. When I hear my mother's cough and see my children shivering, I feel heartbroken! People's hearts are made of flesh. How can I not feel pain?</p>
<p>I know that the municipal government also has its own difficulties, but I am a poor teacher. I don't have any extravagant desires. I only ask the authorities to allow us poor teachers to get through the winter. (A Primary School Teacher)</p>
<p>Concerns About a Rubber Factory in the Alley</p>
<p>I live in Lane 51, Jiaozhou Road, West Shanghai. Next door is a small rubber factory, and the loud noise of the machines continues all night, disturbing our sleep. I am even more concerned that rubber products are extremely flammable. Not long ago, a report stated that the Xin Rubber Factory in Panjiaku was burned for several hours due to a fire in the neighborhood, and it was difficult to extinguish. Fortunately, it was located in a remote area, and there were few consequences. It is originally forbidden by the authorities to open factories in residential areas, but now a highly flammable rubber factory is located in a densely populated and narrow street. If something unfortunate happens in this cold winter, the tragic situation of the residents in the multi-story buildings is unimaginable. This concerns public safety. I am personally experiencing it, and I feel a sense of danger, so I dare not remain silent. I hope the authorities will pay attention to it and not say that I did not speak up sooner. (Yong)</p>

<h3>Marshall to Succeed as Secretary of State - US Senate Unanimously Approves - To Create World Peace and Complete Byrnes' Unfinished Work - Maintain "Firm" Principles in Diplomacy with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] The US Senate today unanimously approved the appointment of General Marshall as Secretary of State. During the session, Senator Vandenberg praised both Marshall and Byrnes, saying that the Senate should act quickly to show the world that "the unity and continuity of US foreign policy remain unchanged." The date for the new Secretary of State to take office has not yet been decided, but Byrnes will likely remain in office temporarily until Marshall returns to the United States. Although Byrnes' resignation has caused some surprise, his desire to leave due to physical exhaustion has long been known. Byrnes' resignation is intended to allow him to complete the peace treaties with the five satellite nations. The news of Byrnes' resignation was originally scheduled to be announced in a few days, but it was announced earlier because the news had already been leaked. According to White House Press Secretary Ross, Marshall and Byrnes reached an understanding several months ago that Marshall would take over after Byrnes' resignation. Observers believe that the change in Secretary of State will not affect the bipartisan policy pursued by Byrnes.</p>
<p>[Reuter, Washington, 8th] Marshall's appointment as US Secretary of State will undoubtedly continue Byrnes' foreign policy and maintain the same "firm" approach towards the Soviet Union. Diplomatic and congressional leaders alike believe that Marshall will continue to build world peace to complete Byrnes' unfinished work. Marshall's first major task will be to use the next few weeks to intensify efforts in preparation for attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in March to discuss the German and Austrian peace treaties.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] Diplomatic circles here believe that the reason for Byrnes' resignation is that the United States will change its policy towards the Soviet Union, but American foreign policy will not abandon its basic principles of "prudence and firmness," nor will it become more tough or subtle. The essence will remain the same, with only slight modifications in degree. It is said that Byrnes believed that if the system of the Paris Conference could be maintained, the fundamental differences of opinion between the United States and the Soviet Union could eventually be gradually eliminated. Byrnes was skilled in this approach, often using diplomatic delaying tactics in order to gradually achieve America's goals. It is said that Marshall will now change his methods, forcing a showdown and clearly abandoning the "needle prick" strategy adopted by Byrnes. According to observers here, although the Moscow Conference only has the overall peace treaty on the agenda, if Marshall proposes a broad review of the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union at that time, the Soviet Union will not refuse. However, it is still too early to guess whether this will produce concrete results.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Personnel Changes Expected Within the State Department - Pinko Elements to Be Purged</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] After Marshall officially succeeds Byrnes as Secretary of State, there will be large-scale personnel changes among senior officials of the State Department and US diplomatic representatives. It is rumored that General Marshall intends to send former Commander of the US Forces in China, General Albert Wedemeyer, as Ambassador to China to replace John Leighton Stuart. Senior State Department officials who are expected to resign include Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, Roosevelt's brain truster Byrnes, and Benton, who is responsible for US international propaganda. Some observers say that Byrnes has been away from Washington for too long, so the internal organization of the State Department has become lax. After Marshall takes office, he should thoroughly reorganize and eliminate those with communist and far-left leanings. It is expected that there will be more military personnel entering the diplomatic field than before. Regarding the purging of pro-communist and far-left elements, the Republican-controlled Congress has long been calling for this. As for the problems that Marshall will face in the future, in addition to the various negotiations on the Four-Power talks, there are also military and diplomatic issues such as the joint defense treaty in the Western Hemisphere, the standardization of armaments with Britain and other countries, and the long-term occupation of the former Japanese islands in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of the Army Broadcast - Japan No Longer Poses a Threat to the US</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 9th Broadcast: US Secretary of the Army Patterson stated emphatically in a special broadcast today that Japan no longer has a navy, army, or air force, and is definitely unable to attack the United States again. He also pointed out that the United States is eager to expedite the repatriation of Japanese from the Soviet Union and Soviet-controlled areas so that they can have the opportunity to learn democracy and make their country self-sufficient as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Appointment as Secretary of State - Reactions in European Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] The resignation of US Secretary of State Byrnes has been met with surprise and regret in various European countries, and unanimous praise for Marshall's succession. A British Foreign Office spokesman unconditionally expressed support for Marshall's leadership of US foreign policy. Moscow remained silent, but the Soviet-controlled newspapers in Berlin stated that Marshall would cooperate more closely with the Soviet Union. Some European newspapers believe that Marshall's appointment as US Secretary of State shows that the United States is paying attention to the situation in the Far East. London diplomatic observers say that the Soviet reaction will likely depend on Marshall's success in mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] Furthermore, diplomatic circles here refuse to speculate on Marshall's future attitude towards the Soviet Union, only saying that Marshall had deep personal friendships with Stalin and other senior Soviet generals during the war. When the three giants of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Potsdam in 1945, Stalin gave Marshall a signed album and asked him to sign it in his own handwriting for remembrance. Voroshilov and Gromyko also presented Marshall with rare gifts such as Soviet caviar and vodka.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers Conference - Not to Be Postponed</h3>
<p>Soviet Authorities Guarantee Freedom of the Press</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] A US State Department spokesman said today that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to be held in Moscow in March and has never considered postponing it. Marshal Marshall's appointment as Secretary of State will not cause the conference to be delayed. At the same time, Byrnes will expand the performance of the duties of Secretary of State to await Marshall's takeover.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th] United Press Moscow reported that editor Leonard Rieser telegraphed that the Soviet Union has guaranteed broad freedom of news coverage at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Moscow in March. On this basis, it would appear that news policies in the Soviet Union will be greatly modified.</p>
<h3>Truman Submits Economic Report to Congress - President's Tone Quite Optimistic</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman submitted a statement to Congress today saying: If the United States cannot fulfill its promise to reduce tariffs, it will have a far-reaching impact on world politics and the establishment of hope. The country has the greatest production, employment, and purchasing power, so it should not fear foreign competition, but should promote plans to achieve mutual reduction of trade barriers. The International Trade Organization initiated by the United States is the most important step in rebuilding large-scale foreign trade on a sound basis. However, whether most other countries are willing to join this organization largely depends on our attitude in this year's reciprocal tariff negotiations. The government has the power to reduce current tariff rates by 50% without seeking congressional approval.</p>
<p>International Discussion on Reducing Tariffs</p>
<p>The United States has invited 18 other countries to hold a meeting in Geneva in April this year to discuss the same reduction of tariffs and the elimination of other trade restrictions. If we cannot fulfill our responsibility to place international economic relations on a sound basis, some countries will seem to be forced to increase their own control, and this development will inevitably divide the world into separate trading blocs. The only way to maintain the prosperity of the United States in 1947 is to maintain current tax rates, raise minimum wages, improve social welfare, and maintain rent control. Reducing wartime income tax is not sound fiscal policy. The balance between real purchasing power and production capacity must be achieved by reducing prices.</p>
<p>Taxes Maintained at Current Standards</p>
<p>Taxes should be maintained at current standards. Sound public finance requires that government revenue exceed expenditure when there are many jobs and large total income. The tax burden is heavy and should be reduced as soon as possible, but when it is reduced in the future, it must be fair and equitably distributed.</p>
<p>The President's lengthy report began with an optimistic tone, saying that at the beginning of 1947, the strength and prosperity of the United States were unprecedented, and our hopes were never so clear. The American people should reject the idea of another depression.</p>
<h3>Soviet Chief of General Staff to Visit Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 9th Broadcast: Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, Marshal Vasilevsky, has accepted invitations from US Chief of Staff Eisenhower and British Field Marshal Montgomery to visit military installations in Britain and the United States in the near future.</p>
<h3>Philippines to Establish National Defense Committee</h3>
<p>President Roxas to Serve as Chairman</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 8th] President Roxas is about to issue an order to establish a National Defense Committee, with himself as chairman, to formulate the Philippines' comprehensive defense policy, including the issue of leasing bases to the United States. Any agreement that US Ambassador McNutt and Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino may reach will be reviewed by the National Defense Committee and then submitted to the Philippine Senate for discussion in the form of a treaty. US military advisor to the Philippines, Jones, and Philippine Deputy Chief of Staff, Shaker, are drafting a ten-year defense plan to deal with the latest developments in warfare and the strategies of the atomic age.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Situation Remains Tense: France Conscripts New Soldiers, Moutet Advocates a Two-Pronged Approach of Politics and Military</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The Ministry of Defense today issued a communique stating that French defense officers, junior officers, and soldiers may be sent to the Far East, owing to developments in the Far East situation. At the same time, the age for voluntary conscription into the defense forces has been reduced from nineteen to eighteen years. Regulations for the conscription of general volunteers to serve in the Far East have also been amended to recruit a large number of experienced young men into the military. In addition, two battalions of veteran soldiers departed from Toulon for Vietnam today without delay.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Calcutta, 8th] French Overseas Colonial Minister Moutet arrived here today, returning from Vietnam. He plans to inspect French colonies near Calcutta and Madras. Mr. Moutet said that the Vietnam issue cannot be resolved solely by military force. A political solution can be achieved once the Viet Minh understand that the agreements previously reached between France and Viet Minh must be faithfully implemented by both sides. French policy remains unchanged. We still intend to maintain the autonomous government of Viet Minh and the autonomous government of Cochinchina, he said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hanoi, 8th] The Chinese, British, and American consuls there today walked to the Viet Minh defense line to demand assurances for the safety of 200 French civilians held as hostages. The outcome is not yet known. It is also reported that the Viet Minh intend to resume political activities, and if negotiations can be resumed, they can halt military activities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hanoi, 9th] United Press monitored a broadcast from the Vietnam People's Republic radio station last night, containing statements about resisting to the end, even to "suicide." Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh broadcast a speech saying, "When our resistance is successful, we can drink to our hearts' content."</p>
<h3>King of Transjordan Braving Snow Arrives in Ankara</h3>
<p>[United Press, Ankara, 8th] King Abdullah of Transjordan arrived here today in the heavy snow aboard the Turkish President's special car, with a grand welcoming ceremony.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Truman's Speech at the Joint Session of the U.S. Congress (Part II)</h3>
<p>Restricting Monopolies</p>
<p>The second important issue I am pleased to discuss before you is the gradual concentration of economic power and the resulting threat to free competition in private enterprise. In 1941, the Temporary National Economic Committee completed a comprehensive investigation of the nation's economic activities. According to the committee's research, despite the implementation of anti-trust laws for a century, the most dangerous threat to our well-being is the accelerated concentration of power in the hands of a few and the patterned organization.</p>
<p>At that time, this long-standing trend of economic concentration accelerated even further. As a result, we now find that the extent to which the entire industry is controlled by a small number of organizations is far greater than in the past. These few large organizations can limit production for higher profits, thus reducing the number of employed workers and people's purchasing power.</p>
<p>In an effort to ensure that businesses have full and free competition opportunities, we will work to implement anti-trust laws. Congress can do much to cooperate and assist in this legislation.</p>
<p>It is not enough to simply strengthen the enforcement of laws governing business practices. In addition to enforcement, there must be active measures to assist new enterprises. Government assistance, research programs, and lending powers should be used to promote the growth of new businesses and new industries. Assisting small businesses is particularly important at this time. We should also pay special attention to the diversification of industry and the development of industrialized areas.</p>
<p>Housing Problem</p>
<p>The third major policy that is also very important to the national economy is an active encouragement of housing construction programs. The first federal program to alleviate the housing shortage for veterans was announced in February 1946. In 1946, housing units for one million families were under construction, and another 665,000 units were completed. The rate of expansion in the proposed area has broken all records.</p>
<p>In the coming year, the number of housing units will be close to the peak construction year of 1946, if not exceed it. The responsibility for delivering housing to veterans at reasonable compensation lies with private industry and labor. The government will continue to accelerate the circulation of important building materials, restrict non-residential construction, and provide financial assistance. Special emphasis will be given to stimulating the construction of rental housing and new types of housing.</p>
<p>To achieve the long-term goal of providing housing for everyone, housing legislation is urgently needed, similar to the non-partisan bill passed by Congress last year. At a minimum, such legislation should open the way to rebuild the destroyed areas of our cities and encourage private capital to invest billions of dollars in large-scale housing projects. Such legislation should provide for improving housing in rural areas and building 500,000 affordable public housing units in four years. The peacetime Federal Housing Agency should be authorized to ensure the effective use of our resources on the housing front.</p>
<p>Financial Affairs</p>
<p>The fourth major policy is related to balancing the budget. In such prosperous times as these, the federal government's budget should be balanced. If we want to handle public finances prudently, we must begin to reduce the public debt. The budget I will submit to you during this term will have some surplus. In the budget message, I will make various suggestions that will result in a larger surplus to be used for repaying the national debt. One of the proposals is that Congress should take early action to continue wartime tax rates in the next fiscal year, which will expire on June 30, 1947, under current law.</p>
<p>Expenditures on the war remain high. A considerable amount of money is needed to alleviate world famine and suffering. Assistance to veterans will continue. The current world situation still requires large military expenditures. The interest on the public debt and certain other expenses cannot be reduced.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I have had to practice austerity in the preparation of the budget. I hope that Congress will cooperate with me in every economic program.</p>
<p>Agricultural Problems</p>
<p>The fifth important policy concerns the welfare of farmers. In 1946, food production reached its peak. There are many of our grains that can be sold overseas without affecting our domestic market. But in the coming years, American agriculture will face the same dangers as after World War I.</p>
<p>We all remember the results. Amid declining demand and prices, agricultural products continued to increase, which was completely opposite to the situation in industry, where prices rose but production decreased. Once agricultural products are overproduced, disaster follows.</p>
<p>We must solve the problems that we could not solve after World War I. Existing laws will provide considerable stability to agricultural product prices in 1947 and 1948. We should use these two years to maintain and develop our markets to adapt to our tremendous productivity.</p>
<p>The purpose of these laws is to allow for an orderly adjustment from wartime to peacetime. The government's price support program is not intended to absorb the unlimited overproduction of a highly productive agriculture. We should not wait until the protection period expires; we should urgently lay the foundation for permanent rural welfare.</p>
<p>Farmers should have a fair income. We can often find ways for them to make good use of their new skills and better policies, so that they can expand their domestic and foreign markets and implement the goal of a balanced peacetime production, so that farmers and the government do not suffer unnecessary losses and expenses.</p>
<p>General Welfare</p>
<p>Among our national resources, none is more precious than the health of our people. A year ago, I expressed to Congress my views on a national health program. Congress has taken action on some of the proposals in this program, namely, proposals on mental health, maternal and child health, and hospital construction. I have asked Congress to complete the work it did last year and implement the most important recommendation in the program, which is to provide adequate medical treatment to all who need it. This supply is not charitable in nature, but is paid for from the funds obtained from the implementation of the program.</p>
<p>An administrative change will be of great help in further promoting our national programs for health, education, and welfare. I again recommend the establishment of a comprehensive welfare department.</p>
<p>Veterans</p>
<p>The fourteen million service members of World War II have now returned to civilian life. Most of them have settled down and are employed. The quick and successful completion of this adjustment has made a great contribution to both the service members and our economy.</p>
<p>With the assistance of the federal government, more than one million veterans have entered schools or acquired job skills. Thousands of injured and sick veterans receive daily medical and hospital treatment. The government has also guaranteed loans for about 500,000 veterans to purchase homes, farms, or start new businesses. Two million disabled or deceased veterans have received compensation. More than three million still hold government-issued life insurance policies. Seven million veterans have received unemployment benefits and other allowances.</p>
<p>In addition to severance pay, the implementation of the veteran program costs more than seven billion yuan each year, which is about one-fifth of our total federal budget. This is a veteran program that no country has ever had before and is far-reaching.</p>
<p>Except for a few minor adjustments, I believe that our veteran program is now complete. The success of this program will not be judged in the future by how many veterans have received financial assistance or by the amount of money we have spent. History will not judge us based on the amount of money we have spent, but on how well we have enabled our veterans to dedicate themselves to the greater contribution of the country. We should pay attention to this when considering any other legislative proposals.</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen many people in our country attack the individual constitutional rights of citizens, as a result of racial and religious prejudice. Many of our people are unable to enjoy the right to participate in elections for local and national civil servants. The freedom to participate in legal professions has been denied. The will to combat these evils should be in the heart of each of us.</p>
<p>As for the federal government, the Department of Justice is now carrying out this battle to the fullest extent. Although the Constitution prevents the federal government from maintaining peace in certain states, I do not believe that the current legislation reaches the limits of federal power to protect the public rights of the people. Therefore, I have established the President's Committee on Civil Rights by executive order to study and report on the entire issue of civil rights and to make recommendations to Congress. (End)</p>

<h3>Reducing Tax Rates on Entertainment, Banquets, and Hotels Approved After Review: Director of Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan Reports at Budget Meeting, Total Budget to Be Reduced by 30 Billion After Tax Cuts</h3>
<p>[Our report] The main task of the second meeting of the Municipal Council is to review the municipal government's budget for the 36th year. The council's budget committee felt that the previous general meeting was too rushed and the budget review was not detailed enough, so this time it has added a special emphasis on review. The review meeting was held all day yesterday, starting from 9:30 in the morning and ending at 9:00 in the evening. The regular and temporary income and expenditure budgets of the eight bureaus of the municipal government, as well as the general affairs office and the civil affairs office, were reviewed throughout the day. Relevant bureau chiefs attended to explain.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the budget meeting reviewed the budgets of various bureaus, special attention was paid to the administrative expenses of each bureau, in addition to investigating the number of employees, and inquiring in detail about the vehicles equipped by each bureau. The committee stated that it hoped that each bureau could reduce expenses as much as possible to reduce the burden on citizens.</p>
<p>[Another report] Gu Chunfan, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, attended the review meeting of the Budget Committee of the Municipal Council yesterday and reported that the city's hotel tax was originally levied at 20%, but now it has been reduced to 5% in accordance with central government regulations, which will reduce the originally budgeted 8.4 billion yuan for this year by 6.3 billion yuan. The entertainment tax, which was originally 40%, will also be reduced to 25%, which will reduce the originally budgeted 207 billion yuan by 70%. The drama tax is planned to be reduced to 15%, but it still needs to be submitted to the central government for approval. The starting point for the banquet tax was previously set at 3,000 yuan, but it has now been changed to 5,000 yuan, but both Chinese and Western cuisine are treated the same. Restaurants with music and dancing are levied at the entertainment tax rate of 25%, while others are divided into two grades, A and B, with grade A being levied at 20% and grade B at 10%. According to current tax collection, 60% of the banquet tax is collected from more than 70 restaurants, so there is no impact, but 40% is collected from small restaurants in grade B, so this will be reduced by half again, reducing 5 billion yuan. After the use of license tax is levied in accordance with central government regulations, it will be reduced by 2.6 billion yuan. After the reduction of the above tax collections, the total budget will be reduced by approximately 30 billion yuan. If the municipal government's newly listed labor substitute fee of 40 billion yuan cannot be approved by the general assembly, then the total budget for the 36th year will be reduced by at least 70 billion yuan, which accounts for about one-third of the total.</p>
<p>Director Gu also explained that the business tax is generally considered to be too low, but in reality, it cannot be increased any further. After the central government stipulated eight special commodity taxes, the business tax can no longer be collected. The Finance Bureau, based on the 5,000 households collected by the Direct Tax Bureau as a standard, found that 7,500 households should be collected, but only 42,000 households have declared. Most of these 7,500 households are vendors, and the Finance Bureau has not urged them to pay taxes out of consideration for the burden on small vendors. At the same time, the business tax is not entirely based on business income, but on commissions and capital, so although 28 billion yuan is included in the budget, it cannot actually be collected. Regarding the house tax, since the central government already has laws and regulations, this city can follow them, but the central government has previously been asked to approve the collection in accordance with the current method, but there has been no reply to date. The slaughter tax stipulates that the weight of each pig is uniformly calculated at 80 catties. The bureau has conducted a detailed investigation, and this standard is indeed reasonable. The budgeted income for the business license tax is 900 million yuan, which may be increased, but it is difficult to estimate and requires further study.</p>
<h3>Health Committee Review Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Health Committee held a review meeting at Xingzhong School yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss proposals related to health. The meeting was chaired by Chen Cunren. The results of the review were as follows: (1) The mayor submitted a proposal for the municipal government to organize health insurance for 100,000 workers. The resolution was passed in principle, but in order to suit the living habits of the workers, both Chinese and Western medicine should be adopted, and there should be no bias towards Western medicine.

(However, the Budget Committee's review results decided not to include it).</p>
<h3>Hotel Industry Representatives Petition</h3>
<p>[Our report] When the Finance Committee review meeting was in progress, five representatives from the Hotel Industry Association came to the meeting to petition, stating that the 20% hotel tax levied on room rates was unbearable and appealed to stop the collection to relieve the people's difficulties. The meeting sent Senators Lu Shidao and Wang Weiyin to meet with them. This case was listed on the agenda, so after a heated discussion, it was resolved to collect 5% of the special tax rate in accordance with central government regulations to live up to the people's expectations. In addition, the theater industry, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the wine and food industry, and other eight groups petitioned to reduce the banquet and entertainment tax, and the municipal government submitted a proposal for the central government to revise the new law on banquet and entertainment tax and propose supplementary measures for public discussion. Review opinions: (1) The entertainment tax should be levied at 25% in accordance with central government regulations, effective from February 1, 36th year. The Finance Bureau should consider reducing the drama tax rate to show promotion. (2) The starting point for the banquet tax should be changed to 5,000 yuan, and those with dancing equipment should be levied at 25%.

(2) In order to reduce the suffering of the people, the Municipal Council suggested to the central government to reduce taxes, and requested the central government to simplify the names of taxes and reduce various tax levies to repay the people and increase the amount of tax revenue.

<h3>Abolishing Cash Bail Passed in Principle</h3>

<h3>Housing Issues: Examination of Four Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Land Administration Committee reviewed four proposals related to land administration at its review meeting yesterday: (1) Request the Municipal Government to maintain the first resolution of the Municipal Council, explicitly ordering landlords throughout the city not to increase rents arbitrarily, in order to maintain the livelihood of ordinary people, and that landlords shall not refuse to deduct the housing donation portion, please make a public resolution and send it to the Municipal Government for effective implementation. The committee's opinion after review is that the rents in this city are still relatively low compared to other commodity prices. Although there is a difference in the rental of some houses compared to the original multiple regulations of the council, most landlords are still considerate of the burden of tenants and still charge according to the regulations. However, this matter is of great importance to the burden of tenants in the city, and the landlord's income is not enough to cover expenses, which is also a real situation. Because this case is of great importance, the council is not in a position to decide on its own, and requests the general meeting to discuss and decide on how to handle it.</p>
<h3>Extension of Unified Lease</h3>
<p>(2) Propose extending the unified lease method to prevent military, government, and educational personnel coming to Shanghai from becoming homeless. The review opinion is: the original residents of military, government, and educational personnel and cultural groups who have been legally allocated and have no deficiencies are still allowed to continue renting. Those who have not yet signed a lease agreement, the original owner shall not refuse to rent for any reason, and shall promptly sign the agreement. The two methods are passed, and the request to forward a letter to the court for adoption and implementation is reserved.</p>
<h3>Requesting Allocation of Court Housing</h3>
<p>(3) Request the Municipal Government to follow the resolution of the first general meeting of the council and allocate housing for the High Court and the District Court of this city on a deadline, so that they can relocate and work. The review opinion is to propose that the general meeting approve. (4) Request the Municipal Government authorities to stipulate the profit of the second landlord in intermediate leasing to reduce the burden on the third tenants. The review opinion is to send it to the Municipal Government for reference.</p>
<h3>Judge Housing Dispute: Involving Socialite</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The famous socialite Lan Ni and the exporter Li Shenyan once rented a bungalow at No. 11 Haiyuan, Haig Road, from Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the lease expired in July of the 31st year. It was found that the owner of the house is Dai Rongwu, a prosecutor of the High Court, who entrusted Zhejiang Industrial Bank to manage the rent. Recently, Dai, who originally lived at No. 4 Rose Villa, Baisezhong Road, had the owner, the socialite Lan, needed to take it back for her own use, and wanted to move back to No. 11 Haiyuan, but the lessee was unwilling to give it up, so she sued in court. Yesterday, the District Court held a hearing, and the defendant's lawyer, Zheng Lintong, argued that the owner should have a reason to take it back for his own use. Zheng originally had a place to live, so why did he have to move? Lan, the owner of the Rose Villa, also originally had a No. 2 residence, so there was no reason to take it back. The plaintiff's lawyer, E Senzhi's representative, lawyer Wang, said that the Rose Villa is the property of Director Sun, who entrusted Lan Ni to manage it on his behalf, and now Director Sun needs to take it back for his own use. He also presented a letter from Director Sun to lawyer Zheng as evidence. The debate ended at 3:00 PM, and the date for judgment was set.</p>

<h3>Our Captured Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai from Australia: Various Groups Welcome and Console: The Jiangwan Road is Endless</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] More than 300 of our officers and soldiers who were captured by the enemy during the War of Resistance and forced to work as coolies in Australia returned to China and arrived in Shanghai the night before. After landing yesterday, they were temporarily housed in the barracks next to the Jiangwan Conservatory of Music. Military and police agencies and civilian groups in the city went to express their welcome and condolences, and ten rounds of military trucks transporting supplies and food were endless on Jiangwan Road.</p>
<p>The officers and soldiers who arrived in Shanghai this time totaled 339, including 36 officers and 303 soldiers. Most of them belonged to the 16th Division, 67th Division, and 79th Division of the former 86th Army in Zhejiang, totaling 245 people. A part belonged to the Southern Jiangsu Guerrilla Force, including the Righteous National Salvation Army Security Team, totaling 60 people. There were also 34 soldiers from the Four Lines Regiment. The team leader was Wu, a former lieutenant colonel staff member of the Lanjia Division camp. The deputy team leader was Ge Xianxiong, a former lieutenant platoon leader of the Special Service Battalion of the 86th Army Headquarters. In the spring of the 31st year, the 86th Army defended Quzhou to the death, and more than 2,000 people were captured due to being outnumbered. In addition to deaths and disappearances, there were still more than 503 people, together with 1,000 people brought from Nanjing and 1,600 civilians from Liangguang, totaling more than 3,000 people, all of whom were taken to Australia. After arriving on Yabul Island, New Britain, Australia, they were isolated and used for their disposal. However, due to enemy treatment, deaths accumulated, so when they first arrived in Australia, the total number of soldiers and civilians was more than 3,100, while only 1,567 people were gathered for reporting after the victory, and the death rate was more than one-half.</p>
<p>When Australia was taken over by the British army, with the help of the British, all 1,500 people were able to concentrate in one place after many days of searching and trekking through mountains and rivers. Until last month, the first batch of 1,139 people first returned to China by ship, of which 799 civilians from Liangguang had landed in Hong Kong and returned to their homes. There are currently 11 civilians and 417 officers and soldiers from Guangdong remaining in Australia, led by Major Chen Guo, waiting for the ship to return north.</p>
<p>The disposal methods for all returning officers and soldiers have been printed by the First Supply District Headquarters as "Investigation Forms for Officers and Soldiers Remaining in Australia", which are distributed to the returning officers and soldiers to fill out within three days, so that they can be reported to the Ministry of National Defense for hearing and assignment.</p>

<p>The French Concession Tram is Practicing "Slow Work": Passengers at Each Station Stand and Wait, Crowded Beyond Belief (Photo by Our Newspaper Reporter)</p>
<h3>French Concession Tram: Snail's Pace: Management Denies It is a Year-End Bonus Issue: The Company Loses Tens of Millions Every Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Recently, due to labor disputes, the French Concession Tram has experienced a "slow work" phenomenon. On Xiafei Road, trams are connected end-to-end, moving at a snail's pace, and many passengers abandon the trams and walk. Reporters learned from the employees that this "slow work" is not due to disputes over year-end bonuses and wage increases, but due to dissatisfaction with the "Company Regulations" of the concessionaires. The company stipulates: (1) Must stop at every station, (2) Cannot stop if not at the station, (3) Cannot exceed the specified time, otherwise will be subject to suspension. Currently, three people, including No. 159, are still in the suspension period due to being punished for this reason. In order to make a strong resistance, the workers used the excuse of complying with the company regulations, implemented the rules of stopping at every station and not stopping if not at the station, and deliberately delayed the driving time, making it snail-paced. However, according to the management, the labor often does not comply with the company regulations, delays the payment time, and insults passengers, resulting in poor business conditions. After the recent "slow work" occurred, the company's losses have reached as high as 30 to 40 million yuan per day, so it is now applying to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau believes that this action by the employees is a small matter for the company's losses, but it has a profound impact on the city's traffic order, so he is prepared to mediate in person. It is heard that Director Wu will convene the responsible persons of the tram workers' union today to listen to the labor's opinions and order them not to take "slow work" action from today onwards, so as not to affect traffic order.</p>
<h3>Jiangning District Office: Housing Disputes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The house at No. 12 Zhonghua New Village, Xinzha Road, was originally the property of the traitor Zhou Bangshi. After the victory, it was sealed up by the Third Front Army. Later, because the Jiangning District Office had no place to work, it moved into the premises on February 28 of last year with the permission of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and separately submitted documents to the Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters for record.</p>
<h3>Measures to Suppress Hoarding and Speculation: Social Affairs Bureau Ordered to Continue Application</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau previously used the measures to suppress hoarding and speculation of important daily necessities during the emergency period. It is now asked whether to continue using it. It has been reported to the Municipal Government for requesting the Ministry of Economic Affairs to verify. It is learned that the Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to continue applying the measures, but it must be applied after designating the suppression area and goods according to Article 5 of the same measures and making a public announcement. The original application, except that rayon, velvet thread, soybean oil, and sugar are not included in the suppression, should be approved by law before being designated again. It has been legally designated Shanghai as a suppression area for the hoarding and speculation of clothing cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, fuel coal and charcoal, daily necessities paper, matches, vegetable oil, and pigments (including dyes), peanuts, and sesame oil. The implementation of the suppression of clothing cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth should be handled by the China Textile Professional Management Committee in coordination with the competent authorities. The implementation of the suppression of fuel coal and charcoal should be handled by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee in coordination with the competent authorities. Other items shall be executed by the competent authorities. The Central Trust Bureau has also entrusted to take care of the houses and found that after March and April, Zhang Yamin, an auxiliary police officer of the Garrison Headquarters, claimed to have occupied the premises as a residence through the relationship of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. After several negotiations with the district office, the lower level is still the office of the district office, and the upper level is used by Zhang Yamin as a residence. The phase has been going on for more than half a year, and disputes have arisen from time to time. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Zhang Yamin suddenly came downstairs and ordered the district office to move out immediately, and especially moved the documents, tables, chairs and other items out of the office and into the alley. After the district chief Hou Junren was informed, he immediately rushed to negotiate, and went to the Civil Affairs Office of the Municipal Government to report to Director Zhang Xiaosong, and asked to uphold justice. At 4:30 PM yesterday, he visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government. After Mayor Wu heard about the situation, he immediately expressed that he would definitely maintain it, and hand-wrote that the district would return to its original place and work as usual. It is heard that Mayor Wu has negotiated with the former destination.</p>

<h3>Hiding Gold in Bathtubs is All Fabrication: Personnel Friction in the Fisheries Management Office: Creates a Mystery on Fuxing Island: Prosecutor's Three Investigations Reveal the Inside Story: Hardened Cement Found to be Resources Intended for Illegal Sale</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The intricate and complex mystery of the Fuxing Island gold hiding case has been clarified by the prosecutor Gu Hongbiao of the District Procuratorate after more than a month of arduous investigation. At 9:00 AM yesterday, prosecutor Gu, accompanied by clerk Yang Naichang and member Yu Lexing of the Headquarters, made a third trip to Fuxing Island, and returned to Shanghai at around 4:00 PM. On the island, they interviewed all relevant staff members of the Fisheries Management Office of the Agricultural Committee of the Headquarters, such as technical committee member Wang Qianli, administrative section chief Li Yunpeng, and Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, Wang Yikang, Xu Fuqi, and others. After returning to the District Procuratorate, prosecutor Gu hurriedly interrogated Chen Jiahuo and Tan Xinmin, who were in custody, and cross-examined them on what they had learned during the day. Although the two still refused to tell the truth, prosecutor Gu finally confirmed that the informant "Yang Biheng" did exist, and that his real surname was indeed Yang.</p>
<p>The cause of this case was due to personnel friction in the Fisheries Management Office, so it was mixed with some elements of intrigue and framing. So far, it is known that the matter of the two bathtubs of gold bars is all fabricated.</p>
<p>Although there are traces of resource leakage, it is difficult to find evidence, and the number cannot be estimated. Prosecutor Gu is now dividing this headless case into three parts: (1) Yang Biheng or "Yang Bitang" falsely accusing Fisheries Management Office staff of concealing gold bars and resources; (2) "Bai Zhicai" accusing Li Yunpeng of corruption and counter-revolution, etc.; (3) Resources left by the former Japanese army, which were concealed and sold jointly by Fisheries Management Office staff and Niu Chunlin, the then platoon leader of the island's naval garrison (who has been sentenced by the Navy Military Law Office). The above three parts are roughly clear. First, "Yang Biheng," whose real surname is Yang, "Biheng" or "Bitang" is either his courtesy name or an alias. Yang was instructed by two high-ranking officials to report the matter. Although prosecutor Gu does not yet know his exact address, it is highly likely that he will find this mysterious figure in the short term. The section of the confidential report signed "Bai Zhicai" accusing Li Yunpeng of corruption, etc., has been found to be a false accusation. The instigator was Zheng Ziping, the confidential report was drafted by Zheng Guodong and Wang Jindong, and copied by Zheng Weixin. All four have been taken into custody in the detention center. They are all acting under the instructions of others. Yesterday, prosecutor Gu specially interviewed a certain lady on Fuxing Island who participated in instructing the writing of the confidential report, but the lady had already fled and disappeared. As for colluding with the navy to steal and sell resources left by the Japanese army, this is a very obvious fact. After the naval platoon leader Niu Chunlin was arrested, someone secretly reported that Li Yunpeng had given 30 taels of gold to Niu Chunlin's family. Yesterday, the prosecutor asked Li about the matter, although Li only admitted to having visited Niu's family. However, the prosecutor believes that Li is the administrative section chief, and all the workers are hired by him, and most of the workers were introduced by the island's navy, so Li Yunpeng's relationship with Niu seems to be an undeniable fact. As for the extent of Li's suspicion, it cannot be determined so far. Li has now been guaranteed by Commissioner Yu of the Headquarters that he will not escape. In addition, the hardened cement buried underground discovered by prosecutor Gu on his second trip to Fuxing Island on December 3 last year has now been found to be resources left by the Japanese army, which a certain senior official attempted to conceal and sell illegally. Later, because it could not be transported out, it was buried underground in an attempt to cover up the evidence.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when prosecutor Gu conducted his third investigation, Xu Fuqi, the director of the Fisheries Management Office, Wang Yikang, the deputy director, Li Jing, the administrative director, Li Yunpeng, the section chief, and Wang Qianli, the technical committee member who was initially responsible for the takeover work, were all present. After more than five hours of questioning, it was clear that the prosecutor knew the subtle personnel relationships involved. Prosecutor Gu will take a car to Beijing this morning, or will be delayed in Beijing for several days, so there is very little possibility of new developments in this case this week.</p>
<h3>Fire on Jiangning Road: Three Factories Suffer Great Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Longhua Cigarette Factory at No. 36, Lane 876, Jiangning Road, suddenly caught fire accidentally at 4:00 AM yesterday, affecting the two neighboring properties. After three hours of rescue, the fire was extinguished. In addition to the tin-wrapping room and machine room of the factory being completely destroyed, it also affected three factory buildings of the China Oak Factory at No. 828 and five factory buildings of the Xiangtai Coal Ball Factory at No. 822, causing huge losses.

<h3>Mutually Accused of Being Traitors: Questioning an Old Private Tutor</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the High Court heard a case in which both plaintiffs and defendants were suspected of being traitors. Gu Rufang was accused of assisting the enemy and puppets by serving as a puppet Baozhang (neighborhood head) and a clerk at the Yikang Lane No. 7 soil warehouse in Caojiadu, and implementing poisonous substances. The accuser, Chen Jigeng, worked at the enemy Zhenru Radio Station. Because he stole light bulbs and wires, he was seen by Gu Rufang. Later, he was fired from the radio station and suspected that Gu had reported him, so he resented him and accused Gu at the High Procuratorate. Gu also counter-accused Chen Jigeng of being a traitor, so they were both prosecuted. Yesterday, the High Court heard the case and summoned the witness Qiu Tingzhen. Qiu is an old private tutor who gave testimony favorable to Gu, saying that Gu's appointment as puppet Baozhang was elected by the people.</p>
<p>In the Ni Qianji traitor case, the High Court held a hearing yesterday to summon witnesses. Ni was accused of cooperating with Xu Nianyi, the puppet Zhejiang Security Office Director, to open banks, silk weaving factories, and ham stores, and weaving military silk for the enemy to kill aircraft. Yesterday, witnesses Zhang Jizhong, Wu Mansong, Luo Haixun, and Shi Jinrong testified in court, which was favorable to the defendant, saying that the Huajin crepe woven was ordinary commodity and not military use. The court ordered a later hearing. Wu Jianchong, once served as the captain of the 8th Detachment of the Righteous National Salvation Army and an action member of the Military Statistics Bureau Shanghai District. In the 28th year, he was arrested by the Japanese garrison in Songjiang. After being released, he was ordered by the Righteous National Salvation Army to participate in the puppet organization and served as the puppet police chief. Later, he was captured by the enemy Hunan Gendarmerie and finally defected to the enemy, served as a secret agent of the enemy gendarmerie, and reported the whereabouts of Wu Jie, the secretary general of our two-way special party department, to the enemy gendarmerie, causing Wu to be arrested by the enemy. He was previously sentenced to eight years in prison by the High Court. The defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. Yesterday, during the trial, the defendant tried his best to defend himself, still claiming to be doing underground work and not defecting. Wu Jie's arrest by the enemy was not reported by him. The court ordered the sentence to be pronounced on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<p>On October 20th of the 33rd year of the Republic, Li Hu joined the escort team of the enemy's Central China Fisheries Company, serving as an adjutant and acting as a deputy squadron leader. He was previously sentenced to two years and six months by the High Court. The defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial. Yesterday, during the trial, the defendant firmly denied the position he held. The court ordered the sentence to be pronounced on the morning of the 14th.</p>

<h3>Receipt Invoice Stamp Duty Measures Ministry of Finance Clarifies Doubts</h3>
<p>When industrial and commercial businesses sell goods, they often issue invoices. When payment is received, a separate receipt is issued. Although both invoices and receipts are required to affix stamp duty according to tax law, it seems redundant to affix stamp duty to both when they pertain to the same business. It is understood that the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau has submitted three measures to the Ministry of Finance for approval, as follows: (1) If sufficient stamp duty has been affixed to the receipt for the same transaction, the invoice or bill of sale may be exempt from stamp duty, but it must be attached to the receipt for inspection purposes. If the receipt is lost, the invoice or bill of sale will be treated as tax evasion. Therefore, the issuer of the document must ensure that it is attached to avoid punishment. At the same time, to prevent customers from tearing them apart, the issuer should add a stamp on the invoice or bill of sale stating "Stamp Duty Affixed to Receipt No. X," and add a stamp on the receipt stating "This is Receipt for Invoice or Bill of Sale No. X." In this way, the documents can be easily verified no matter how they are stored, and there is no need to worry about being penalized. (2) If an invoice for the same transaction is issued and stamped first, the receipt issued later should still be attached to the invoice by the issuer and stamped. In this case, it will be exempt from stamp duty; otherwise, stamp duty must be affixed separately. (3) If the price listed on the invoice and receipt do not match, stamp duty should be affixed according to the higher amount. The above measures have been forwarded by the bureau to the Chamber of Commerce and relevant industries for their information.</p>

A reporter visited the delegation representatives, who stated: The purpose of this trip was threefold: (1) to request the Ministry of Finance to grant a full exemption from business tax; (2) to request the Ministry of Communications to reduce postal rates; (3) to request loans from the Joint Treasury. On the day of arrival in Beijing, it was reported that state-approved textbooks could be fully exempted from tax, and other books would be taxed at half the rate. An inquiry was made to the Ministry of Finance for clarification. Li Tijun, the Director who received them, stated that the news circulating was unreliable, and the Ministry had not made a final decision on the tax exemption for the book industry, also stating that the book industry and the newspaper industry are both cultural undertakings. Therefore, the delegation earnestly requested the same treatment as the newspaper industry, with full exemption from business tax. Cui, the Deputy Director of the Direct Taxation Department, promised to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that, on the grounds of supporting culture, the newspaper industry has been granted a business tax exemption, and the book industry has reason to request the same treatment, otherwise it cannot be considered fair. Regarding reducing postal rates and improving delivery methods, Vice Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Communications and Deputy Director Huo of the Postal Administration, etc., solemnly stated that they would be happy to help with anything the Ministry of Communications could do. Regarding the loan issue, a request was made to the Joint Treasury. The focus of the problem was the collateral. Ordinary factories can use finished products, raw materials, or factory buildings as collateral, but banks have no precedent for using books as collateral. Therefore, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Vice Minister Li of the Ministry of Finance were asked for clarification. Both stated that books are also commodities and can be used as collateral for finished products, and expressed their willingness to help the loan succeed in order to save the book industry from its current crisis. It is heard that the delegation will soon send telegrams to colleagues across the country, urging them to work together to strive for this.</p>
<h3>Landlord Demands 2,000-Fold Increase in Rent for Dental College</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The District Court yesterday heard the case of Xie Zixian suing the Dental College founded by dentist Situ Bo, requesting a judgment ordering an increase in rent. The land on which the Dental College at the intersection of Lin Sen Middle Road and Ma Dang Road is located belongs to Xie Zixian and was originally rented to Xu Deji for a term of twenty-two years, expiring in 1952. In 1931, Xu Deji transferred the lease rights to Situ Bo, stipulating an annual rent of 560 yuan. Now Xie is demanding a 2,000-fold increase in payment. At yesterday's hearing, lawyer Zhao Zuwei appeared on behalf of Pan Gongzhan, the legal representative of the college, and submitted a statement of defense. He argued that the municipal government's regulations stipulated that the rent could only be increased by 144 times, and the college's current expenses already exceeded this amount. Moreover, upon expiration of the lease, all buildings on the land would belong to the owner, so his benefits were already substantial. The demand for a 2,000-fold increase has no basis, and he requested the court to reject it. The debate on the case concluded, and the court announced that a verdict would be delivered on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Bei Zuyi Returns from Hong Kong, Jokes with Reporters About the Weather</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In recent months, the situation of overseas remittances evading regulations and smuggling in Hong Kong seems to be getting more and more rampant. This has caused everyone to look south, hoping that the government will close this loophole sooner or later. Finally, four days before Christmas last year, Bei Zuyi, the Governor of the Central Bank, led Rogers, the British economic advisor of the Executive Yuan, and others, chartered a China National Aviation Corporation special plane and flew directly to Hong Kong. The day before Mr. Bei's departure, he also made a hurried trip to Nanjing. Therefore, everyone inevitably thought that Mr. Bei's trip was entrusted with a major economic mission. However, perhaps due to the influence of the weather, or other reasons, Shanghai newspapers published news of Mr. Bei's return to Shanghai as early as a week ago, but Mr. Bei never came. As a result of everyone's anticipation, Mr. Bei's special plane finally landed at the airport at 1:15 pm yesterday. Sensitive news colleagues, after 3 o'clock, went to the Central Bank to wait. President Bei was late in arriving, and after waiting for a long time, they had to leave one by one. After 5 o'clock, a second batch went to the Central Bank to wait. The hospitable ones handed their business cards to the tea servers to pass them in, and seeing that there was no sign of refusal, everyone sat down and waited with peace of mind. After a while, they were seen. Everyone scrambled for a piece of white paper, pen in hand, waiting for President Bei to announce the gains of this trip. President Bei said, "There is nothing to say..." Unable to withstand everyone's repeated questioning, he smiled and said, "There are two things that are worth saying. One is that the weather in Hong Kong is warmer than in Shanghai. Also, there are especially many Hong Kong mandarin oranges and apples. As for the rest... I'm sorry, I can only tell you after I go to Nanjing." Afterwards, everyone launched guerrilla-style questions, and President Bei said again, "Let the outside world speculate as they wish about the gains of this trip. I am working for the 400 million Chinese people, not for these speculators, so I am satisfied as long as I have a clear conscience." Disappointed, everyone had to leave with their still-empty journalistic appetites, dejectedly. (The above is a recent photo of Mr. Bei, taken by our newspaper reporter)</p>

<h3>Textile Control Commission Passes Detailed Rules for Yarn Purchase The priority for Yarn Factories is to sell Cotton Yarn; Cotton Cloth can be used as a Supplement when Cotton Yarn is Insufficient.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Control Commission held a routine meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Attending were Wu, the concurrent chairman, Li, the vice-chairman, and committee members Shu Zhenzhang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qizi, Tang Xinghuo, Guo Dihuo, Lin Fengbao, as well as Liu Wenteng, the director of the Commission's Business Department, and Wang Zijian, the director of the Secretariat. Fang Dong, the director of the Goods Tax Bureau, also attended. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM. During the discussion, the new agreed-upon prices for various types of cotton yarn were determined based on the standard of 1,975,000 yuan per piece for the highest-priced 20-count cotton yarn, taking into account the production costs of each type of yarn. At the same time, the Detailed Rules for Cotton Yarn Purchase, consisting of eight articles, were passed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) These detailed rules are formulated in accordance with Articles 1 and 5 of the Measures for Stabilizing Yarn Prices.</p>
<p>(2) The purchase of yarn and cloth from each factory will be tentatively determined once a week. Starting from January 1, 1947, the implementation will begin in the 36 private factories in Shanghai and the state-owned China Textile Construction Company. Subsequently, the implementation will be gradually expanded depending on the purchase of foreign cotton by yarn factories in various regions.</p>
<p>(3) Each factory should fill out and submit a daily yarn factory report and submit a weekly cotton yarn and cloth sales notice, listing half of the yarn and cloth produced in the previous week that should be purchased by the government, directly to the Commission for processing.</p>
<p>(4) The Commission will review the items listed in the weekly cotton yarn and cloth sales notices from each factory and fill out a commissioned (approved) cotton yarn and cloth purchase notice. The approved copy will be sent to the selling yarn factory, and two commissioned copies will be sent to the affiliated China Textile Construction Company to handle payment, warehousing, and sales.</p>
<p>(5) Each factory will receive payment from the Textile Construction Company based on the Commission's approved cotton yarn and cloth purchase notice, along with the warehouse receipt bearing the Commission's title, tax bill, and receipt of payment. For the convenience of allocation and distribution, the aforementioned warehouse receipt should be issued for each piece. Afterwards, when the Textile Construction Company sells the yarn and cloth, it will endorse the original warehouse receipt and give it to the customer for collection from the factories.</p>
<p>(6) The products sold by each factory to the government should primarily be cotton yarn. For any high-count yarns, half of their production should be sold. If cotton yarn is insufficient, it can be supplemented with grey cloth. If grey cloth is still insufficient, it can be supplemented with dyed cloth. The labor costs for grey cloth and dyed cloth will be added separately. However, if the weaving workshops attached to each factory require more cotton yarn than half of their cotton yarn production, all excess quantities may be purchased back from the Commission by the respective factories at the current market price.</p>
<p>(7) The yarn and cloth sold by each factory to the government should maintain its original quality and continue to use its original trademark, being completely identical to the products sold by the factories themselves.</p>
<p>(8) These detailed rules will be implemented from January 1, 1947.</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase matters, the Commission has already sent a notice to all yarn factories on the 2nd of this month, instructing them to reserve half of their products for purchase. The Commission has also drafted inspection regulations for the standards and grades of various types of cotton yarn. Once passed at the next routine meeting, they will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Rise; US Dollar Also Up by More Than 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Gold continued to trend upward yesterday, driven by strong buying pressure. The opening price was 3.66 million, and the buying demand intensified, soon surpassing the 3.7 million mark. With no supply sources available, it continued to rise. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 270 taels at a price of 3.73 million, but buyers were not discouraged. Only after rising to 3.765 million did the Central Bank exert pressure, causing it to fall back to around 3.75 million. When buyers surged again, with no supply sources available, it again approached the 3.8 million mark at noon. In the afternoon trading, it briefly rose to 3.85 million, forcing the Central Bank to sell heavily, which caused a small pullback to around 3.78 million. As a result, it closed up 90,000 yuan from the previous close. Gold jewelry rose to 400,000 yuan. Silver dollars rose again, and the black market rate was stable. Interest rates remained at around 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also saw steady gains yesterday. The black market rate for US dollars opened at 6,400 to 6,500 in the morning. Later, with the gold market rising, it climbed to around 6,700 at noon. In the afternoon, with gold prices rising, the trend continued upward, but not by much. As a result, it closed up more than 400 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars also saw significant activity, driven by the exchange rate, rising from around 1,200 yuan to over 1,300 yuan. As a result, it also rose 130 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 1,180 yuan to 1,200 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,440 yuan to 1,460 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,000 yuan to 19,200 yuan. Most of the trading was in Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Recover</h3>
<p>Government bonds saw stability yesterday. The C-type bond opened at 1,900 yuan in the morning, with sales from Runde and others. However, major players like Room 550 first sold and then bought, gradually pushing the price up to 2,300 yuan. Room 552 first bought and then sold, and by the close, it had pulled back to around 2,100 yuan. As a result, A, B, C, and D types were each up 150 yuan from the previous close, C-type bonds recovered 200 yuan, and E-type bonds rose 100 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 3 million yuan.</p>

Baiyuan rice was stable at high prices, while Yinyuan also softened. The oil market saw robust sales and purchases. Raw oil recovered after a period of weakness, first stabilizing and then rising, ultimately recovering over 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil remained strong. Suzhou oil saw brisk sales and purchases due to the aroma and dryness, continuing to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Clear oil was stable, and rapeseed oil was firm. The sales and purchase of Shantou soybean cake became more active than yesterday, rising slightly by 100 yuan. The situation for soybeans, in terms of both sales and purchases, did not appear robust and remained in a standstill. Red beans temporarily remained unchanged, while green beans from Nanyang were accumulated, keeping prices stable. Corn from Qingdao was scarce and in high demand. Red sorghum was being absorbed by distilleries, and the market trend was upward. Wheat was scarce and expensive, rising another 1,000 yuan, with demand still exceeding supply. Sesame was stable, but black sesame saw a surge of 10,000 yuan due to high sales volume in the market towards the end of the year.

<h3>Food Evaluation Committee Readjusts Rice Prices with Respective Increases over Original Prices</h3>
<p>The Food Management Section of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau convened a Food Evaluation Committee yesterday, which reset food rice prices as follows: (1) Changshu japonica rice at 69,000 yuan per dan (market transaction price, hereinafter referred to as "market price"), 76,000 yuan (door price); (2) Thin rice (market price) 65,000 yuan, (door price) 72,000 yuan; (3) Early rice (market price) 62,000 yuan, (door price) 68,000 yuan; (4) Pier indica rice (market price) 63,000 yuan, (door price) 70,000 yuan; (5) Milled indica rice (market price) 60,000 yuan, (door price) 66,000 yuan; (6) White indica rice (market price) 55,000 yuan, (door price) 61,000 yuan; (7) Mutton indica rice (market price) 65,000 yuan, (door price) 72,000 yuan. The above-mentioned evaluated new prices are slightly higher than the previously evaluated prices by 5 to 10 percent. After the meeting, Food Section Chief Shi Mingzhai stated: This rice price adjustment is not due to a lack of food or a cutoff in supply, but rather because the City Chamber of Commerce repeatedly requested that "the sales price of food should be reasonable and stable." After repeated consideration, it was decided to make a slight adjustment.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities such as Cotton Yarn, Cloth, and Coal are Subject to Crackdown on Hoarding and Profiteering.</h3>
<p>Ministry of Economic Affairs Responds to City Government Explanation</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau had previously planned to crack down on the hoarding and profiteering of daily necessities in order to suppress commodity prices. Because the Ministry of Economic Affairs' regulations on severely punishing hoarding and profiteering were very broad, all items except salt were not subject to the crackdown. This affected the implementation of the city's policy of stabilizing commodity prices. The City Government inquired with the Ministry of Economic Affairs for an explanation some days ago, and the response arrived yesterday. It stated that the item of salt, which was originally listed, had been designated in the past and should be addressed after consulting with the Ministry of Finance. As for the listed items of artificial silk, wool, sugar, and soybean oil, they were not originally on the list for a crackdown and should be designated after being approved by the Ministry. Shanghai is now designated as an area for cracking down on the hoarding and profiteering of essential daily necessities during the extraordinary period under Article 2 of the Measures, which includes: Clothing: cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth. Fuel: coal, firewood. Daily necessities: kerosene, vegetable oil, pigments (including dyes), peanuts, sesame oil. Furthermore, it is requested to announce this information to the public in accordance with Article 7 of the Measures. The enforcement of the crackdown on clothing items such as cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth should be carried out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Textile Industry Management Committee in conjunction with the competent authorities. The enforcement of the crackdown on fuel items such as coal and firewood should be carried out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee in conjunction with the competent authorities. The enforcement of the crackdown on other items will be carried out by the competent authorities.</p>
<h3>Although Sales to Customers are Sluggish, the Yarn Market Has Seen a Turnaround</h3>
<p>The yarn market saw a turnaround yesterday. The stubborn trend of the previous two days was swept away. The rising prices of cloth and gold have led to firmness in the yarn market, arousing the buying appetite of people in the industry. 20-count yarn rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, while 32-count single yarn and 42-count sewing thread saw buying interest, rising by 60,000 to 80,000 yuan. However, sales to customers remained sluggish, which was a drawback.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Tycoon Chen Zixin Talks About the Plight of Cotton Farmers in the Suburbs of Shanghai. The Income from Farming is Less Than Half the Cost; Cotton is Unsaleable and Cotton Factories Declare Bankruptcy; the First Step to Saving the Situation is to Improve the Varieties.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Chen Zixin, a cotton yarn industry tycoon from Pudong, to inquire about the truth of unsaleable mechanical-picked cotton flowers. He said: Jiangsu Province produces the most cotton in the country, and the counties near Shanghai, although the climate is relatively humid and the warm season is not long, are still excellent cotton-growing areas. 50 percent of farmland is used for cotton cultivation. Before the war, the annual output had reached 800,000 dan. However, due to the impact of the war, the original improved variety plan had to be suspended, leading to a gradual degradation of varieties. It is said that before the war, most of the mechanical-picked cotton flowers produced in Pudong were supplied to various yarn factories, while the rest were sold to Japan, India, and other places. After the war, with the opening of manual and power mechanisms, the cost of using mechanical-picked cotton flowers increased, and the products decreased significantly. Therefore, the path of mechanical-picked cotton flowers became narrow. However, according to what he knows, the cotton ginning factories purchased 20,000 dan of mechanical-picked cotton flowers last September. At that time, the purchase price was about 200,000 yuan per dan. Now, adding several months of interest, the cost has reached more than 300,000 yuan per dan. However, the current market price has fallen to about 170,000 yuan. As a result, some cotton ginning factories have declared bankruptcy. As for the cotton in the hands of cotton farmers, there are now also 300,000 dan. In terms of its production cost, if calculated on average in the eight counties near Shanghai, each mu produces 100 catties of seed cotton, which is one and a half gongs (i.e., one and a half bales), each gong of seed cotton weighing 67 catties on the market scale. When the new seed cotton came on the market at the end of September this year, the selling price per gong was 27,000 yuan, but now it has fallen to 27,000 yuan. The income of cotton farmers per mu is only 40,500 yuan. For those who cultivate on their own, calculating the cost of seeds, raw materials, labor, and paying taxes, each mu costs at least more than 100,000 yuan in legal tender. If they are tenant farmers, the cost will inevitably be heavier. According to the current price of cotton clothing, which is only 160,000 yuan per 100 catties (Sima scale), the hard-earned income of farmers at the end of the year, the value of each 100 catties of seed cotton, is less than half the cost. In other words, farmers must lose half the cost of each dan of seed cotton they harvest, even less than one-third of the cost. Therefore, the plight of farmers is very pitiful. The best temporary solution is to find a way to purchase cotton at cost. Otherwise, farmers will have no enthusiasm to plant again this spring. The fundamental solution is to start with improving the varieties. The main reason for the unsaleability of mechanical-picked cotton flowers is that they cannot be used to manufacture fine yarns. If the varieties can be improved so that they can be used to manufacture 20-count yarns, then the situation will improve. The relevant parties are now jointly formulating a method for improving varieties, based on the method of improving cotton seeds in the Yangsi District of Pudong before the war. They will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities to promote its implementation, in order to increase cotton production and solve farmers' livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Applies for Production Loans, Transferred to the Joint Treasury for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Electrical Silk Industry Guild reports that rumors of the Production Loan Provisional Review Committee denying loan applications from the industry at its routine meeting this past Wednesday have caused widespread anxiety. Starting at 10:00 AM yesterday, an emergency meeting was held, appointing Cai Tao, Liu Qingyi, and others as representatives to inquire about the truth from Li Fusun, Xu Jiguang, Qin Runqing, and Lin Fengbao, standing directors of the Production Loan Committee. It was learned that the matter was a misunderstanding, and the Wednesday meeting had resolved to transfer the industry's loan applications to the Joint Treasury Loan Subcommittee for review. Yesterday at around 5:00 PM, the representatives took the case to the Municipal Government, intending to ask Mayor Wu to arrange a meeting with Huo Yamin, chairman of the Production Loan Committee, to explain the industry's current dire situation and the urgent need for loans before the end of the year. It is said that the Joint Treasury Loan Subcommittee's loan terms are stricter, mostly requiring raw materials and finished products as collateral. As such, the assessed loan amount for the industry is currently no more than 5.5 billion yuan. The Production Loan Committee's loans allow for half the collateral to be in the form of machinery, enabling factories to utilize the funds received. Factories stated that if they obtain loans from the committee, they will immediately repay the loans approved by the Joint Treasury to be issued by the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Two-Thirds of the Bottled and Canned Food Industry Closed</h3>
<p>American bottled and canned food products have recently flooded the market in this city. The Shanghai Bottled and Canned Food Industry Guild, which originally had over 180 member companies, has seen an increasing number of businesses unable to operate and forced to close since the victory, due to the dumping of American canned food products in the market. To date, only about 50 companies remain.</p>
<h3>Major Off-Floor Investors Absorb Shares, Hua Shares See Tightening Liquidity, Fatigue Gradually Emerges After 1000</h3>
<p>Hua shares continued to rise yesterday, stimulated by the gold market and absorbed by powerful investors. However, they repeatedly advanced and retreated. Major investors off-floor absorbed substantial amounts, and the available spot supply became increasingly depleted. The market opened higher due to the lure of the gold market. Numbers 207, 47, 70, 155, and 186 came in to buy, with spot Yong yarn reaching 700 yuan, and forward Yong yarn reaching a high of 708 yuan. Numbers 14, 224, 76, and 83 sold, causing a retreat to 688 yuan. Numbers 198, 154, 180, and 197 came in to buy, and with the gold price rising, the market reached 716 yuan. Numbers 145 and 112 frequently supplied, and Number 173 also sold, causing the market to drop below 693 yuan. Number 97 bought from time to time, and Number 95 strongly bought spot Yong yarn. The gold market surged. After 11:30 AM, signs of fatigue suddenly emerged. Numbers 224, 145, and 78, among others, bought actively, and a certain powerful figure off-floor absorbed whole blocks of shares, leading to tight liquidity and a sudden rise to a high of 725 yuan for spot transactions and 732 yuan for forward transactions. After Numbers 89, 3, 198, 186, 171, 177, and 5, among others, disposed of their shares, a sharp decline was immediately seen. Forward transactions even broke the 710 yuan mark. However, the gold price closed exceptionally strong, and the noon close was still able to match the morning's level. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong yarn Hua shares rose by half a percent, while Xinhuo and Xinguang rose by slightly less than half a percent. Jingfu and Qinxing rose slightly, while Meiya fell slightly. Dormant shares such as Match, Commercial Press, Yonggong, Wuhe, and Jinglun each rose by a small amount, up to half a percent. The rest showed no improvement. In forward transactions, Yong yarn, Meiya, and Huafeng rose by half a percent, Xinhuo rose by slightly less than half a percent, and Qinxing rose by about 10%. In the afternoon, the market opened flat. At high prices, Numbers 112, 83, 174, 224, and 152 disposed of their shares. Although Number 198 made efforts to support the market from time to time, it still fluctuated downwards, with forward transactions retreating to 705 yuan. Numbers 155, 12, and 198 bought up to 717 yuan, while Numbers 186, 85, 154, 224, 147, 14, 180, and 70 sold actively. After 3:00 PM, the market gradually declined, falling below 700 yuan, and sentiment gradually weakened. Under Number 61's intentional suppression, supply was provided from time to time, and selling pressure suddenly increased. Spot transactions retreated to 676 yuan, and forward transactions to 677 yuan. However, the off-floor market appeared stable, and spot Yong yarn soon rose to around 685 yuan. At this point, however, forward transactions were still being suppressed by Number 61, but they were maintained by Numbers 198 and 152, and after their absorption, the market stabilized slightly near the close, rising slightly after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong yarn, Xinhuo, Jingfu, and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya and Xinguang each fell by half a percent, and Qinxing fell slightly. Dormant shares Match, Jinglun, and Yonggong rose by half a percent, Zhongsi, Lianan, and Wuhe rose slightly, Commercial Press was flat, and the rest fell slightly. In forward transactions, Yong yarn and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya rose by half a percent, Xinhuo fell slightly, Qinxing rose by slightly less than 20%, and Xinguang fell by slightly more than half a percent. Off-floor, all shares remained stable.</p>
<p>Foreign shares continued to rise yesterday. A certain account forcefully bought Yisha shares on behalf of the yarn industry and continued buying after the market closed, with transactions reaching 8700 yuan after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha shares rose by 15%, while British-American Tobacco, Yisha Beer, Wheelock Marden, Steel, Navigation, and Paper each rose by about half a percent. Ye Guang was flat.</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Advocates Revising Trade Policy Towards China, Reducing American Tariff Barriers, and Emphasizing Chinese Protectionism</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] Foye, President of the American Chamber of Commerce for the Far East, submitted a memorandum to the State Department's Exchange of Information Committee at the end of last month on behalf of 400 member companies regarding the trade agreement to be negotiated with China next spring. The memorandum advocated revising trade policies towards China and tariff values that hinder American exports to China, reducing American export tariffs, and reducing American tariff barriers on non-competitive Chinese goods. Although the companies had raised various tax reduction requests, the memorandum only addressed general trade policy. The Chamber urged the authorities to pay special attention to ensuring that the Chinese authorities adopt reasonable and consistent policies for the valuation of imported goods. The Chamber has received complaints from American exporters that Chinese authorities often estimate import duties based on black market prices in China, rather than on genuine wholesale market prices. This not only creates market chaos but also stimulates price increases. Another section of the memorandum pointed out the need to improve the procedures for the Chinese government to publish and implement trade regulations. Abruptly announcing new restrictions without early notification to importers, exporters, and relevant Chinese agents often creates unexpected difficulties for American businesses trading with China. Recognizing China's urgent need for various machinery, equipment, and foreign raw materials, the Chamber advocated reducing tariffs on a variety of American exports to China. This point is of particular significance in light of recent protectionist tariff proposals by the Chinese business community. Currently, there is a significant imbalance between China's imports and exports, with Chinese exports accounting for only a small portion of imports. Therefore, the Chamber recommends reducing tariffs on Chinese imports as much as possible. In fact, there are a limited number of goods imported from China to the United States that can have their tariffs reduced, so it is necessary to promote this policy. Before the war, goods from free trade countries, including important raw materials such as tung oil, raw silk, and raw hides, were mostly tax-free or taxed at a rate of two-thirds. However, the average tariff rate on taxable imports was over 55%. The Chamber believes that if these tariff rates can be effectively reduced, it will certainly stimulate Chinese imports and correct China's current import-export imbalance, which recently forced the city government to adopt an import licensing system. The memorandum further stated that the tariff rates should be reduced for various handicrafts and cottage industry products, such as carpets, lace, embroidery, hair nets, porcelain, bamboo ware, straw hats, etc. These goods do not compete with American products and had already established a firm position in the American market before the war. Due to inflation and economic collapse in China, which have caused high domestic living costs, the import taxes levied are often several times higher than before the war, greatly affecting sales. In order to promote sound reciprocal trade, these goods should not only be subject to tax reductions but should also be placed on the list of duty-free goods. The memorandum concluded that there is no way to improve China's export industry until the exchange rate is stabilized and the official value of the Chinese currency is consistent with its actual purchasing power. Therefore, the Chamber recommends that in addition to implementing tariff reductions, the Chinese government should also take measures to stabilize the currency system.</p>

<h3>Principles for Tuition Fees for Private Universities Next Semester Have Been Drafted by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] It was previously rumored that tuition fees for private universities would double starting next semester, causing great panic among students at private universities.

As for truly impoverished students, there is no reason to force them to drop out of school.

<h3>University Basketball Game Yesterday, Datong Wins Over Tongji After a Hard Battle, Hujiang Defeats Datong in the Women's Group</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Three university basketball friendship matches were held yesterday afternoon, all at the Municipal Gymnasium. There were over 2,000 spectators. When the Hujiang women's team played Datong, the cheering squad came to the stadium to cheer, and the momentum was very enthusiastic. Unfortunately, the audience's level was too low, and they didn't know what a cheering squad was, and responded with "soda sounds", which was really disappointing. The results of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>Specialist Group Xin Zhuan Wins Over Gong Zhuan</p>
<p>In the opening game between China Xin Zhuan and Gong Zhuan, the referee was Li Zhenzhong. Both sides lacked coordination, and the battle was quite dull and lacked excitement. Gong Zhuan took the lead with 8 to 6 in the first quarter, but trailed behind with 13 to 19 in the first half. In the second half, Xin Zhuan's Zhao Jian made a breakthrough on both sides, rising straight up, and finally won a big victory over Gong Zhuan with 42 to 29.</p>
<p>Hujiang Women's Team Defeats Datong</p>
<p>In the second women's group game, Hujiang played Datong, and the referee was Zhang Juefei. The Hujiang women's team, led by President Ling Xianyang himself, entered the stadium amidst the cheers of the cheering squad. As soon as the whistle sounded, Hujiang's Ding Fuheng set a record and connected with the team. Captain Wang Shan was unwilling to fall behind and made six shots, and Datong had almost no power to parry. Moreover, Hujiang's guards Hua Huizhen and Li Aixuan played skillfully and lively. Datong's pitcher Wu Ronglin was surrounded by "walls" on both sides and had no way to do anything. Hujiang led the first game with 17 to 5. At the beginning of the second game, Captain Wang Shan played even more vigorously, with the courage of being unstoppable. She made four consecutive goals. Datong saw that the situation was not good and called a timeout to avoid the sharp wind. At that time, the guards were strengthened, which proved to be effective. Wu Ronglin made two more throws and one penalty, and only then did they get through the difficulties. Hujiang took the advantage with 25 to 10 in the first half. In the second half, the two sides fell into a melee, and few points were scored. By the last quarter, all the warriors were soaked in sweat and exhausted. As a result, Hujiang defeated Datong by a large margin with 32 to 14.</p>
<p>Tongji Takes the Lead in the Finale</p>
<p>In the finale, Tongji played Datong, and the referees were Zhang Juefei and Li Zhenzhong. The Datong team had two veteran players, Xu Zhongji and Lin Weicong, who were members of the Shantou team. They were in front and back, and their momentum was awe-inspiring. Tongji's lineup was more balanced. Although there were more "skinny" players, the charging power was extremely fierce. At the beginning of the competition, Tongji's Xiao Cheng made a penalty and broke the egg. Datong's Wang Zhiping returned the favor and made a penalty to even the score. After a long time of melee, Datong's Xu Zhongji started on both sides, and Datong took the lead by one goal with 7 to 5 in the first quarter. At the beginning of the second quarter, Tongji's offensive was fierce, and Xiao Cheng and Jiang Shangqing threw and cast you, and they made a lot of achievements. Datong only had Xu Zhongji active, and finally fell behind by one goal with 18 to 20 in the first half.</p>
<p>Calm Response Datong Wins</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, the two sides fought for each other, and tied twice at 22 and 28. In the end, Datong's Xu Zhongji and Lin Weicong, the veteran players, were extraordinary and responded calmly, and finally surpassed with 32 to 28. In the last quarter, Datong rose to catch up, and Yang Qiankun made a lot of achievements with long-range shooting and close attacks. However, Datong's veteran Xu Zhongji was like a tiger entering a flock of sheep, and he was unparalleled, and finally won the game. As a result, Tongji lost to Datong by 3 points with 40 to 43. The scores of both sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>Datong Fouls Tongji Fouls</p>
<p>Xu Qunlei 00 Xiao Cheng 24</p>
<p>Wang Zhiping 23 Jiang Shangjing 33</p>
<p>Yan Dianhuan 12 Yang Qiankun 22</p>
<p>Lin Weicong 38 Zheng Zemin 35</p>

<h3>Qinghai in Struggle</h3>
<p>— Aerial Dispatch from Qinghai, January 2nd, Xu Tangying</p>
<p>Ten years ago, most Chinese people had a very vague concept of Qinghai. Even if they did, they would only say, "Qinghai, that's a desolate place." However, after nearly ten years of struggle, Qinghai has completely transformed itself today. It's like a four- or five-year-old girl who, after not being seen for a few years, emerges as a beautiful and talented young woman. So, people who have been to Qinghai before are invariably surprised by its progress when they visit it a second time.</p>
<p>Political Stability and Ethnic Unity are the Potential for Consolidating Border Defense</p>
<p>Qinghai was originally a virgin land, always filled with a tranquil and warm atmosphere. The snow on the Kunlun Mountains is still crystal clear, and the old peak of Gotasuchi still soars into the blue sky. The Yellow River and Yangtze River, which encircle the motherland, still flow eastward with surging momentum. What is different is that, thanks to political efforts, many bustling cities and large, close-knit organizations have suddenly emerged. Even in the newly established county bureaus today, such as Qisu, Chengdou, Angqian, and Xinghai, countless forces are being generated. These forces are guiding the pure Qinghai forward with courage, safeguarding the establishment of the southwest national defense of the Republic of China with their strong power. But in the past, who could guarantee that the current situation would exist? Because Qinghai has a long history of clan issues, which are complex and difficult to handle. The animosity between the Hui and Han during the Manchu Qing Dynasty is one example. Today, Qinghai includes clans such as Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, Kazakh, Sala, indigenous peoples, and Luòbā. In terms of lifestyle, some places already have cars, while others are still riding yaks. Some have built tall buildings, while others still live in yurts and Tibetan tents. There are differences in language and distinctions in belief. Some say that Xinjiang is an exhibition of ethnic groups, while Qinghai can be said to be a showroom of ethnic groups. But today, these many very different clans can live together in harmony, like family members, creating a miracle that is rare in all provinces of the country and even in the world. Even people who harbored clan prejudices and hatred during the Qing Dynasty can now forget their past grievances and reconcile as before. Today, the two million people of Qinghai can live peacefully, unaffected by any disturbances. This spirit of sincere unity is indeed the treasure of Qinghai. If this result were not derived from the political efforts of the past ten years, how could it be like this? Therefore, the security of Tibet today is closely related to this latent force in Qinghai and should not be underestimated. At the same time, because it is too harmonious, it is inevitable that it will be envied by others. In the middle of this, many people who specialize in nitpicking will naturally ignore the big picture and only seize on small points to spread rumors and cause trouble. Even so, the ethnic groups in Qinghai are like gold being refined, becoming brighter with each refinement. During the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once toured the Northwest. After Chairman Chiang arrived in Qinghai, he said, "Resistance relies on the Southeast, nation-building relies on the Northwest." Because the Northwest, in terms of location and resources, does have a worthy place for attention. Especially Qinghai, not only has endless grasslands for grazing millions of cattle and sheep, but also has abundant mineral mountains, excavating countless treasures. For example, Datong has coal mines that can produce tens of thousands of kilograms of coal daily and can continue to be mined for more than seventy years. The smokeless coal of Chashilang can serve as a strong backing for establishing factories, not only in large quantities but also with sufficient firepower. Recently, a large amount of oil has been discovered in Minhe. As long as there is machinery and talent, this "blood of the nation" is worth cherishing. In addition, endless fur, hides, horns, and bones are the treasures of Qinghai. At the foot of the Qilian Mountains, there are also many pottery clays and quartz, which are good materials for manufacturing furniture. All of these are what our country needs. But all of these require human harmony as a prerequisite. If the area does not have a stable force, then not only will there be no progress in political construction, but also the large and small problems between ethnic groups will cause suffering. Therefore, to observe Qinghai, we must think from the perspective of great achievements. If we abandon the overall situation and only look at one or two points of negligence, then we will fall into abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. Therefore, the stability of the southwest national defense today is due to the cultivation of this latent force in politics.</p>
<p>Military and Political Cooperation, Educational Progress, Forging a Path to Survival in Difficulty</p>
<p>The late Mr. Willkie visited Qinghai. He believed that Qinghai's politics and military were quite successful, especially the integration of politics and military, so the performance was even better. This judgment is indeed far-sighted and does not allow others to doubt it. Because since the reorganization of the Qinghai Provincial Government in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, politics and military have been closely coordinated, so the construction of highways, the reclamation of wastelands, the cultivation of forests and seedlings, and the revitalization of water conservancy are all the results of military-civilian cooperation. The Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which was built last year, and the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway, which was built this year, are both more than a thousand kilometers long. Along the way, there is dense smoke and rain, no water or grass, and poisonous mosquitoes and bees that prevent people from opening their eyes. Once opened, maggots can grow in the eyes, causing eye injuries. Although the obstacles of weather and terrain are like this, the people of Qinghai have mobilized without hesitation, and in fact, the number has reached tens of thousands of people. However, the problem is not so simple, because along the way there are also Salar bandits harassing and looting in groups. Therefore, the local security forces went to protect them, and most of the national army stationed in the province were mobilized to help the people work. This has produced a lot of effects on the road construction work. Originally, the people of Qinghai have always suffered, and because of the War of Resistance, life has become even more unbearable. However, as long as it is for public welfare, as long as it is national affairs, they will forget their own suffering and carry out their duties diligently and strive to achieve them. This is the lovableness of the people of Qinghai, and it is also the national spirit that China needs most at this stage. Because of this advantage, the Qinghai garrison assists the people, and the people respect the soldiers, thus forming a close emotional relationship of love and cooperation. I remember that last year and this year, when repairing the Qinghai-Tibet and Qinghai-Xinjiang roads, the military and civilians went far into the wilderness, and food was often cut off. Seeing that everyone had nothing to eat, they were worried. Who knew that the troops came up with a way to hunt some wild horses and wild sheep, and after hunting them back, they first distributed them to the starving people. From this point alone, we can understand the feelings between the Qinghai garrison and the local people. The national army stationed in Qinghai not only maintains deep-rooted friendship with the people, but also produces for the country. In the Qaidam Basin and on the shore of Qinghai Lake, wheat waves are swaying in the wind and the crops are abundant in the fields, all cultivated by them. The desolate plains of the past have become fertile fields today. The barren saline-alkali lands of the past may have abundant fruits and vegetables covering the fields today. The Gansu-Qinghai Highway also has their blood and sweat. The trees planted in Qinghai over the years have reached 20 million, and even half of them are their handiwork. Before the War of Resistance, they used inferior weapons and vigorous morale to strike at the bandits who fled from western Sichuan and intended to complete the Luo Ming line. They also annihilated the crowd of Xu Xiangqian's Third Army with a force of more than 10,000 people. Later, they established immortal war achievements in Hexi, Longdong, Hainan, and northern Hubei. They have made great contributions to laying the foundation for the peace of the Northwest. When the situation in Xinjiang was tense in the thirty-fourth year of the Republic, a part of the national army that built the Gansu-Qinghai Highway was trained in Qinghai for a year. The army was reorganized, and the soldiers were strong. Then they passed through Yumen Pass again and laid the cornerstone for pacification outside the Xingxing Gorge. During the War of Resistance, in Anhui and the Central Plains Plain, the Qinghai cavalry was famous throughout the country and established many glorious miracles. Even the stubborn Japanese could not but regard them as a strong enemy. So, if someone goes to Qinghai, you will hear the people praising the army everywhere. Currently, the garrison area of the Qinghai National Army is Lejiawan and Litang. In addition to the local security teams, the total number is about one division. This was formed by reducing the army in May of this year. The remaining officers and soldiers who were dismissed have all been well arranged. Later, the Ministry of National Defense and the Northwest Headquarters sent personnel to inspect successively, and they had a true and good appreciation for military discipline and military affairs. Therefore, this national force has a considerable glorious history in the Northwest and can be said to be the most elite component in the country. If we talk about Qinghai's politics, it can be said to be very simple. And because the Qinghai authorities can pay attention to efficiency in politics, so every policy implemented is successful. All of literacy, afforestation, organization of Baojia, and prohibition of opium are completed on time. Among them, what is especially commendable is that in the eight years of the War of Resistance, Qinghai did not have a single traitor, did not have a single gang of traitors, and had only a small number of local bandits and rampant thieves. This result is entirely due to politics. What the whole country needs now is to seek progress in stability, and Qinghai was the first to apply this rule, and the success was very rapid. This is a fact that everyone can see. Therefore, the progress of Qinghai, in fact, is entirely due to the existence of a sound government. Most of the public education staff have qualifications from secondary schools, but they can all work hard and conscientiously. The government is even more concerned about the lives of public education staff in every possible way. In addition to paying their salaries on a monthly basis in accordance with regulations, the government also finds ways to distribute winter and summer clothing materials and fur coal every year. The lives of general public education staff can still be maintained to a minimum. The number of schools in Qinghai is quite considerable. There are now six secondary schools and more than 800 primary schools. Compared with before, not only the number has increased, but also the quality has improved. Twenty years ago, there were only one or two people who went to schools in other provinces. Now, statistics show that there are no less than a hundred people in various universities in the country. From this example alone, we can calculate the degree of progress in Qinghai education. However, the general cultural level still needs to be actively improved. Ling Chunsheng, the director of the Border Education Department of the Ministry of Education, made a speech in Lanzhou after inspecting Qinghai education last month, believing that Qinghai education is extremely developed. Even Xining City has more than 10,000 students, and especially women's education is even more reasonable. In short, Ling himself believes that "the impression of the inspection is extremely good."</p>
<p>Economic Foundation, Central Guidance, Make Qinghai's Glory Multiply</p>
<p>Talking about the economic development of Qinghai, it was originally later than political construction, but because a strong economic foundation must be built on a solid political foundation, so after Qinghai politics has temporarily tended to be stable, the government has actively paid attention to the development of industry, agriculture, forestry, reclamation, and mining have all been started one after another. In terms of water conservancy, projects specifically for irrigation are also being planned. The Huanghui Canal, which has recently been completed. The water canal and water project have also been planned and laid by an American expert, Moriel, and construction will begin next year. In order to complete the above-mentioned work, the government has specially established the Industrial Bank, the Industrial Company, and the Seagull Factory of light industry to specifically take on the responsibility of developing Qinghai's industry and to establish an ideal economic foundation. However, the industrial development of Qinghai has many difficulties in fact, so the performance in this regard is still very naive and fragile. This is a general phenomenon in the border provinces, and Qinghai is naturally no exception. However, Qinghai itself has many excellent conditions. Therefore, we believe that as long as the central government helps him and guides him, then in today's stable situation, Qinghai is the easiest to embark on the road to industrialization. Up to today, many party departments have been established in the Mongolian and Tibetan regions. There are also more than 10,000 Mongolian and Tibetan party members. Many princes and Living Buddhas have quickly become loyal party members of the Kuomintang. This kind of centripetal force that maintains the nation and the controlling force that stabilizes the border defense are worth paying attention to. However, in the past, in terms of elections, they were always not popular. However, in recent years, this shortcoming has been completely filled. For example, in the recent re-election of the executive and supervisory committees of the Qinghai Provincial Party Department, the people involved included representatives of the Mongolian, factory, farmer, worker, and women. Therefore, in terms of nature, it is relatively complete. We should naturally regard this as a kind of progress.</p>
<p>We already know that the inside story of Qinghai today is in constant improvement and progress. However, the fact that Qinghai still cannot be self-sufficient and urgently needs external help is obvious. If someone ignores this issue, then many objective conditions will limit its development. At the same time, many issues related to the overall situation, if they cannot be thoroughly observed and only imitate the CCP spokesperson Fan Changjiang's unfounded provocation and slander, then they will have failed the hard work and efforts of those working hard to defend the border!</p>
<h3>"Science and Culture Month"—A Pleasant Gathering in Paris</h3>
<p>— Airmail dispatch from Paris, January 2nd. This dispatch was filed by our reporter, Paris-based Ren.</p>
<p>November and December of 1946 were proclaimed as "Science and Culture Month." The world-renowned city of Paris enjoyed nights filled with song and dance. The French authorities, as the host, seized the opportunity to showcase their organizational skills. From the perspective of China, the final few nights of the closing ceremony were particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>The personal art exhibition of Chang Yu-chun, a Sichuan native vigorously promoted by Ambassador Hsieh Shou-kang, was held at the Paris Women's Association (Ctlub Feminin de Paris), not far from the embassy. We specially set aside an evening to invite Chinese and foreign ladies, as well as prominent figures from society, to enjoy music and poetry readings. Chang Yu's works differ from other Chinese artists' who focus on Expressionism or Naturalism; he leans towards a new style of painting, Sur-impressionism. For example, a cat playing with a ball beside a flowerpot with a vermillion background, or white lilies in a glass vase with a black background, or a brown-skinned nude woman lying on a square mat resembling a primordial being molded from clay in ancient mythology. At first glance, they may seem rough and unrefined, but upon closer inspection, one must perceive the beauty of quiet observation within the colors.</p>
<p>Among those who signed the guest book were Zhao Songnan, the former Consul-General who married a young French woman at the age of seventy-seven, and former attaché Chen “Guang,” who gave up his official position to study singing. Also present were Ms. Huang Nutting, a socialite from Peking twenty years ago; Guo Youshou, the former Director of Education for Sichuan; Ms. Yuan Xingjie; Counselor Meng Juru; and Messrs. Yang Su, Wang Hui, Liu Hu, and Huang Qingcong. The event was presided over by the wife of Ambassador Qian Jieping, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Xiao Zisheng and Xiao Lingxiao, and Dr. Zhou Lin. After viewing the art exhibition, the guests gathered in the grand hall downstairs to listen to a piano solo by Ms. Li Xianmin. Ms. Li wore a dark green Chinese-style brocade jacket, draped over her shoulders without being buttoned. Its edges were adorned with golden sequins, which shimmered brightly. The openings and bottoms of the pockets were also encircled with sequins. Although her hair was cut short, it was parted in the middle and slightly swept back at the temples. Bejeweled earrings hung gracefully. The half-open brocade jacket revealed a honey-colored cheongsam underneath, with the lower part of the opening and the entire hem filled with golden sequins that reflected light, casting a beautiful shadow on the floor. The cuffs were also dazzlingly bright. Her fingers danced lightly and elegantly over the piano keys, displaying the skill and dexterity of the Chinese, a spectacle to behold. Looking down at her feet, she lightly pressed the pedals, alternating smoothly between them. Her fingers were used with agility in fast passages and composure in slow ones, like flower shadows in the wind or flowing waves under the moon, infinitely gentle and expressive. The piece she played, "Hommage a la Chine," contained a section that imitated the sound of the pipa. The sounds were like plucking pearls or playing with balls, clear and exquisite, evoking Bai Juyi's "Pipa Ballad" as a timeless masterpiece of realism. At times, she suddenly exerted great force, like a thousand troops and ten thousand horses, or like a magician performing amazing feats, washing away the sluggish and dull style often associated with the Chinese. Her agility was truly unmatched. The second half was low and harmonious, like slow-flowing water, sparse pulse beats, or the careful seasoning of a cauldron, with a relaxed and effortless touch, beautifully poetic. I record it as follows:</p>
<p>"The zither's melody shifts the clamorous hand, windblown blossoms rise and the moon flows. Shimmering light flies like scissors, nimble fingers quick as a shuttle. Exquisite artistry startles with its perceptiveness, complex harmonies respond with skill. For three days the echo wraps around the beam, in the western sea is there a Han E?"</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou Xiao skillfully blends Chinese songs with Western melodies, using great force to express them in one breath, with a vibrant tone that is entirely Western. However, when she sang Yunnan folk songs with Western notation, the Chinese flavor was particularly strong. Her voice was not overly passionate but rather gentle and refined, her demeanor graceful and elegant, like a willow tree in the wind. The audience, both Chinese and Western, was moved and praised her performance. Ms. Zhou, with her experienced demeanor, rested briefly after singing before returning to converse with the audience. Her long, floor-length black Western-style dress, covered with a Chinese-style brocade jacket with floral embroidery, immediately became the center of attention. The audience flocked forward to catch a glimpse, a display of social success rarely seen, showing a deep understanding of the Western psyche. I composed a five-character quatrain on the spot about her red brocade jacket:</p>
<p>"Beautiful quality surpasses the ordinary, preemptive voice seizes the myriad of fragrances, the wisdom pearl is happily grasped, the literary talent admires the Middle Kingdom."</p>
<p>Paris is the fashion capital of the world, where trends often originate. Now, two Chinese ladies' attire has conspicuously emerged at the French Women's Association, leading the way in this great fashion metropolis. Isn't this proof of the superior genius of the Chinese people?</p>

<h3>Coal Gas Poisoning</h3>
<p>— Zheng Weiru</p>
<p>Recently, local newspapers have reported on cases of coal gas poisoning. Regardless of the accuracy of these reports, during the harsh winter season, such unfortunate incidents always occur due to heating with fire. When entire families gather together, the tragedy is even more severe. Therefore, I will briefly describe the causes and prevention methods below, so that everyone can take precautions and avoid such disasters.</p>
<p>When coal or charcoal is heated, it undergoes combustion. The carbon content combines with oxygen in the air, and all the carbon is converted into carbon dioxide, releasing heat. We use this energy to power machines, cook food, and in winter, we rely on it for heating. If we use a stove for heating without chimney and close all the windows tightly, there is a risk of poisoning.</p>
<p>Carbon Monoxide</p>
<p>When coal or other carbon-containing fuels are burned with sufficient air supply, the carbon in the fuel combines with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide, which is harmless unless it reaches extremely high concentrations. However, when the air supply is insufficient, the carbon oxidation only reaches the level of carbon monoxide. At this time, if carbon monoxide accumulates indoors, it is harmful to the human body. If the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air reaches 0.06%, a person in it will become unconscious in two hours. If the concentration reaches 0.1%, a person will lose consciousness in one hour. Moreover, the length of time we spend in air containing this gas is closely related to the severity of the poisoning. Even if the concentration in the air is not high, if we stay in it for too long, we can still be severely poisoned. In fact, what poisons us is not the coal itself, but the incompletely oxidized carbon monoxide. Therefore, it should be named carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>Pathogen</p>
<p>The red blood cells in our body have the task of carrying oxygen from the lungs to various tissues. After delivering the oxygen to the tissues, they return to the lungs to pick up oxygen and transport it to the tissues. Therefore, the only task of red blood cells is to transport oxygen. Without this transporter or without oxygen, we cannot survive. Carbon monoxide gas is not needed by our body, but red blood cells have a 250 times greater affinity for it than for oxygen! Therefore, once carbon monoxide is present in the room, red blood cells will bind to it with a greater intimacy that is 250 times higher than for oxygen. So once they encounter each other, they will bind closely and form a difficult-to-separate carboxyhemoglobin, abandoning the task of transporting oxygen. If one-third of our red blood cells have combined with carbon monoxide, we will not feel much. If it reaches 50%, the symptoms will be more obvious. If it reaches 80%, even if it is detected, it will be impossible to save.</p>
<p>The harm we suffer from inhaling carbon monoxide is not due to the toxicity of carbon monoxide itself, but entirely because the red blood cells bind to it so closely, completely neglecting the task of transporting oxygen. Therefore, if most of the red blood cells combine with it, various parts of the body will not be able to get enough oxygen, resulting in a state of oxygen deprivation. This is the cause of death from carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>Improvement</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas, so even if it invades the room, we cannot predict it. It is lighter than air and not very soluble in water. Children are more susceptible to poisoning than adults, and birds are more susceptible than humans. Therefore, if a caged bird is kept in the room, the bird will die before the person. There are also other chemical methods to detect carbon monoxide, but they are not suitable for home use.</p>
<p>When we add coal to a burning fire, if the upper layer is well ventilated, we can see a beautiful blue flame rising, which is evidence of carbon monoxide being re-oxidized. In the lower layer of the stove, air enters through the grate, so the combustion of coal is complete, and the resulting carbon dioxide rises, encountering the carbon again and combining to form carbon monoxide. If the air in the upper layer of the stove is poor, the carbon monoxide will no longer burn. If there is a chimney, it will be sent out through the chimney. If the upper layer is well ventilated, the carbon monoxide will burn again, forming a blue flame. When starting a fire, the heat is not high enough to cause combustion, and the air circulation is not smooth, so it is easy to produce carbon monoxide. At this time, it is very likely that the harmful gas will fill the room.</p>
<p>The "Coal Gas Poisoning" Disease is not limited to small rooms.</p>
<p>If we are in a small room and close the doors and windows tightly, there is a great danger of poisoning if we light an oil lamp or burn charcoal for heating. The exhaust gas emitted after an internal combustion engine is started also contains carbon monoxide. If a 24-horsepower car is parked in a garage that can only hold one car in winter and the engine is started, the emitted gas can contain 7% carbon monoxide, which can poison the people in the garage in five minutes. In areas with tall buildings and narrow roads, the air in those areas can contain a high level of carbon monoxide due to traffic congestion and waiting vehicles. It is said that the Holland Tunnel under the Hudson River, in addition to the ventilation system, has an automatic signal that is released if the carbon monoxide in the air reaches a certain level as a warning. Household gas contains 6% to 16% carbon monoxide. If the gas pipe contains other odorous gases, we will notice abnormalities before being completely poisoned, unless we are asleep.</p>
<p>Symptoms - The earliest symptoms are fatigue in the limbs, heaviness in the head, dizziness, palpitations, nausea, and vomiting. Half of the blood has already been poisoned. In some cases, the onset is rapid, and the patient loses consciousness without realizing the problem, and dies weakly. The lips and nails of poisoned people are red.</p>
<p>Treatment and Prevention - If carbon monoxide poisoning is detected, the windows of the room containing the poisonous gas should be opened to allow indoor and outdoor air to circulate as much as possible. Or move the patient to a ventilated place and have them lie face down, and then perform artificial respiration, give them oxygen or a mixed gas of oxygen containing 7% carbon dioxide for inhalation, while keeping the patient warm. Before the poisoning becomes deep, they can still be saved. As for wearing a gas mask and risking going into a room containing carbon monoxide to rescue the patient, it is not necessary, because such climates cannot be attracted by ordinary gas masks containing charcoal!</p>
<p>If there is an electric stove or radiator in the room, there is no danger of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>If a stove is used, a chimney for exhausting gas must be installed. If a charcoal basin is used for heating, it is best to start the fire outside first. After the coal is red-hot, place it inside. The same is true when adding coal. It is also necessary to open the windows to allow air to escape. Be sure to extinguish the charcoal fire before going to sleep to avoid poisoning while sleeping.</p>
<h3>Special Device for Pregnant Paralyzed Patients</h3>
<h3>Pathogens of Fever</h3>
<p>— Wu Mao'e</p>
<p>Common sense that patients must know</p>
<p>Feverish diseases can be discussed in two aspects: One is entirely based on the cause of fever. (1) Physiological aspects of fever are mainly caused by the environment being too hot, or the body producing too much heat due to mechanical action, and not dissipating enough, such as heatstroke. (2) Chemical fever is caused by many chemical substances causing feverish reactions, such as sulfa drugs, caffeine, etc. (3) Fever caused by protein reactions: the addition of foreign substances can often cause feverish reactions, such as serum reactions. (4) Losing too much fluid can also cause high fever. (5) Increased metabolism in the body can also cause fever, such as leukemia and toxic goiter. (6) Infectious diseases: many infectious agents, such as filterable viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and rickettsiae, can cause feverish diseases. (7) High fever caused by nerve damage to the temperature-regulating center in the midbrain.</p>
<p>The above are the various causes of fever. Normal people do not have a fever. Having a fever means that a reaction is occurring in the body. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the reason for this reaction in order to treat the symptoms. Fever caused by physiological or mechanical reasons can be easily diagnosed once the patient's environment and activities are known. Fever caused by other chemical agents or drugs, excessive water loss, and high metabolism all have obvious backgrounds and are not difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>The second aspect is how to explore feverish diseases clinically! Fever caused by various infectious diseases is what we encounter most often clinically. There are the most types, the most changes, and we need to pay attention to them. Once the pathogen is found and a diagnosis is made, medication can be prescribed accordingly. Otherwise, in this scientific era with many drugs, it will often be laborious and ineffective, even harmful.</p>
<p>The following special points should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) The patient's age, place of origin, address, occupation, and the date of onset, as well as the epidemic diseases at that time. Certain diseases are limited to childhood, such as measles, chickenpox, mumps, pertussis, chickenpox, poliomyelitis, etc. Some diseases are limited to local areas, such as kala-azar, Japanese schistosomiasis, etc. Some diseases are prevalent in summer, such as cholera, etc., as well as the epidemic diseases at that time, such as influenza and plague. These conditions must all be known to avoid trivializing or overemphasizing them.</p>
<p>(2) The initial situation of the disease. Various infectious diseases have various typical disease courses. Although not always accurate, there is a general pattern to how the disease starts and progresses. There are about three ways of onset: (1) Gradual or slow onset, generally indicating a slow development of the disease, such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and kala-azar. The pathogens of this type of disease need a long time to reproduce after entering the body, and there will be a feeling of discomfort during this incubation period before slowly developing into the typical course of the disease. (2) Sudden onset, generally indicating that bacteria or a certain toxin suddenly enters the body, such as diseases caused by various septicemias or allergic toxins. (3) Acute infectious type, with very obvious signs, such as high fever, headache, and vomiting, indicating the start of an acute infectious process. Most common acute infectious diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis usually have this type of onset.</p>
<p>(3) Early important symptoms and signs: Early blood poisoning, exhaustion, headache, and systemic pain are particularly significant in the following diseases: typhus, relapsing fever, malignant malaria, epidemic diseases. If there is sudden bleeding, it can be seen in typhus, relapsing fever, and spotted fever. Severe headache and vomiting should suggest meningitis. If a rash is common in measles, meningitis, and pneumonia.</p>
<p>(4) Rashes: Feverish diseases with rashes can be classified separately. Attention should be paid to the date of onset of the rash, its characteristics, distribution, and evolution. Chickenpox, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles, typhus, and typhoid fever can all cause rashes, and the date of onset of the rash is generally as in the sequence listed above. The rash of chickenpox can be seen on the first day, and the rash of measles generally appears on the fourth day. Other diseases such as meningitis, relapsing fever, and dengue fever can also cause rashes. Furthermore, the rashes of these infectious diseases all have their specific current conditions and developments.</p>
<p>(5) Characteristics of body temperature: There are various levels of fever. Low fever, the temperature is between 99 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Moderate fever, the temperature is between 100 and 103 degrees Fahrenheit. High fever, the temperature is above 105 degrees Fahrenheit. There are different types of fever, and typical infectious diseases all have their regular patterns. Can be divided into three categories (1) Sustained fever, with daily changes that are minimal and imperceptible, not exceeding two degrees. Typhus, pneumonia, and scarlet fever all belong to this category. (2) Remittent fever, where the daily changes exceed two degrees, but the lowest temperature is still above normal. Typhoid fever is an example. (3) Intermittent fever, where the feverish period is the same as or sometimes below normal, and each period can last for several hours or days, interconnected. This type is seen in intermittent fever of malaria, relapsing fever, and undulant fever.</p>
<p>The course of body temperature: Each typical disease has its special heat cycle.</p>
<p>Short-term fever, subsiding within ten days. These diseases are self-limiting, such as dengue fever.</p>
<p>Long-term fever, the process is also prolonged, and it is most worthy of attention, as it easily weakens the patient's physical strength and leads to a poor constitution. There are at least three diseases that should be considered first: typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and septicemia. Other long-term fever diseases include: (1) Local diseases such as kala-azar, Japanese schistosomiasis, malaria, and undulant fever. (2) Hidden lesion infections such as appendicitis, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease in women, or subacute endocarditis. (3) Syphilis and other chronic diseases.</p>
<p>In short, to diagnose the source of a feverish disease, you must first carefully observe the natural process of the disease's fever and other special symptoms, and then add other collateral evidence before proceeding!</p>
<h3>Physiology and Pathology of Fever</h3>
<p>— Chen Yueshu</p>
<p>Temperature Regulation - We all know that humans are warm-blooded animals, capable of maintaining a body temperature of around 37 degrees Celsius in normal environments. This stable body temperature results from the delicate balance of two opposing actions. Daily food intake, stomach digestion, heartbeats, muscle exertion, and the metabolic combustion of various nutrients within the body all generate heat, raising body temperature. Conversely, blood continuously flows through subcutaneous capillaries, radiating and conducting body heat outwards. The lungs constantly inhale cool air and exhale warm air to dissipate body heat. If body heat is still excessive, sweat glands in the skin secrete sweat, which evaporates and absorbs a large amount of heat. These two processes—heat generation and heat dissipation—are balanced in a normal human body under the control of the nerve center in the hypothalamus of the diencephalon.</p>
<p>Mechanism of Fever - If this temperature-regulating mechanism is overwhelmed by excessively high external temperatures (such as heatstroke) or disrupted by other causes (such as bacterial infection), the patient develops a fever. During a fever, the patient experiences chills and shivering, with muscles contracting to increase body heat. Subcutaneous blood vessels constrict, and sweat disappears, minimizing heat dissipation. Therefore, when the patient feels cold and shivers, body temperature rises sharply. Both the increased heat generation and the reduced heat dissipation are part of the fever mechanism, but the latter is more important than the former. In normal individuals, heat production can increase by 200-300% during intense exercise without causing a fever. In contrast, heat production in a febrile patient increases by only 20-30%. After the temperature rises, it remains at an abnormally high level due to the action of the nerve center. This mechanism is similar to raising the temperature level inside a thermostat by turning a dial. When the patient's fever subsides, subcutaneous blood vessels dilate, and profuse sweating occurs, releasing a large amount of body heat. The nerve center also restores its function to maintain a normal temperature level.</p>
<p>Causes of Fever - There are many causes of fever. The most common is bacterial infection (such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, pneumonia, etc.), which is well known and does not require further elaboration. Let me briefly mention several less well-known causes of fever: (1) Brain damage - As mentioned earlier, body temperature is controlled by the nerve center, so damage to the brain, especially to the diencephalon and pons, can affect this nerve center and cause high fever. (2) If the mechanism for maintaining body temperature balance is overwhelmed by excessively high external temperatures, a person will develop a fever. This type of fever is seen in heatstroke and when using artificial hyperthermia devices. (3) Heterologous proteins (such as intravenous injections of milk or typhoid vaccine) entering the human body can cause high fever. Fever caused by malaria and post-transfusion reactions are also of this type. (4) Certain malignant tumors can often cause patients to develop a fever. The most common examples are adrenal gland tumors and Hodgkin's disease. (5) Certain drugs can also cause people to develop a fever. In summary, the causes of fever are numerous and complex. However, after careful consideration and research by scientists, it seems that there is a common pathway to be found, namely, that fever is often the human body's reaction to the invasion of heterologous proteins (these heterologous proteins may come from bacteria, protozoa, or altered products of malignant tumors, etc.).</p>
<p>Significance of Fever - What is the significance of fever? To date, a definite and satisfactory answer has not been found. In the eyes of ordinary people, fever is harmful and useless, which is very obvious and beyond doubt. Medical experts also acknowledge that excessively high fever (such as above 105 degrees Fahrenheit) is extremely harmful to patients and can lead to death. However, at lower levels of fever, the human body's resistance to bacteria seems to be more favorable than without fever. Two researchers, Lolle and Maijia, conducted animal experiments. They divided animals into two groups, one group was made to develop a fever through artificial heating, and the other group was not made to develop a fever. At the same time, small amounts of bacteria were successively injected into the bodies of the two groups of animals. The two researchers discovered that the animals that developed a fever survived for a longer period of time than those that did not develop a fever and were able to resist larger injections of bacteria. Generally, the mechanism by which the human body resists bacterial invasion can be divided into two parts: one is the phagocytosis of bacteria by white blood cells, and the other is the production of antibacterial immune bodies (such as antitoxins, agglutinins, bacteriolysins, etc.). Lolle and Maijia's further research found that in febrile animals, the production of agglutinins and bacteriolysins was both greater and faster than in those without fever. Therefore, from the above experimental results, we can speculate that fever seems to be a protective function of the human body against bacterial invasion, and not absolutely harmful and useless.</p>
<h3>New Medical Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin from New York</p>
<p>Surpassing DDT</p>
<p>The wonderful insecticidal properties of "DDT" are almost universally known. However, scientists are not satisfied with this. They replaced two "chlorine" atoms in the "DDT" molecule with two "fluorine" atoms, creating "DFDTDileuoro lipnenyl—trichloro— thane". According to a recent report by Professor H. L. Bradlow of the University of Kansas, "DFDTD" has stronger insecticidal properties than "DDT" and its effective period is longer, but its toxicity to warm-blooded animals is lower than that of "DDT". However, it shows no mercy to cold-blooded animals. Cold-blooded animals, your doomsday is coming soon!</p>
<p>Old Method, New Use</p>
<p>Using the "Methylene blue test" to detect the presence of bilirubin in urine is originally a simple and easy old method. However, only recently did someone think of using it to examine whether the livers of patients with amebic dysentery have been affected. There are many diseases like amebic liver abscess in China. It seems that there must be applications in clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Application of Atomic Physics in Medicine</p>
<p>Since the atomic bomb sounded like a thunderclap in Hiroshima, it was truly "earth-shattering" and "shocking to the world". In this atmosphere of peace, dimness, and dense clouds of doubt, some people inevitably curse the physicists who discovered atomic nuclear fission. In fact, the inventions of science, for good or for bad, are up to people. Scientists themselves should not be held responsible for their sinful behaviors. For example, the phenomenon of atomic nuclear fission can be used to kill people, but it can also be used to save people. Taking the current immature stage, there are at least two uses for medicine:</p>
<p>Almost all substances can be transformed into radioactive substances by bombarding the "neutrons" in the atomic nucleus with an atomic fission device. For example, ordinary phosphorus is not radioactive, but after a series of atomic nucleus bombardments, it can be transformed into radioactive phosphorus. If it is eaten by humans, then its whereabouts can be accurately measured, which will make a great contribution to the study of metabolism in physiology, and it can certainly be useful in the diagnosis of certain diseases.</p>
<p>Also, many diseases require radiotherapy. However, there are so few naturally radioactive substances that things are valued according to scarcity. Poor patients are cheap, and they are all irradiated from outside the body. The effect is weak, and there are many drawbacks. But the contribution of atomic physics is great. It can turn the substances we need into radioactive substances, which can be taken orally or by injection, so that the substance directly approaches the diseased area, which is convenient, effective, affordable, and safe - it can be said to have all four virtues.</p>
<h3>Latest Contributions of Pharmaceutical Chemistry - Artificial Penicillin</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Penicillin is one of the two major discoveries of this war, which is already well known. However, the real manufacturing work, before November of this year, was still being secretly carried out by "Ms. Penicillium" herself in her tiny cell factory, which no one could see. However, British and American scientists were not reconciled. With the organization and funding of the government, a total of thirty-seven research teams were established - twenty-six teams in the United States and eleven teams in the United Kingdom - to explore separately, to open the secrets of nature, and to compete with "Ms. Penicillium" for superiority.</p>
<p>"Where there is a will, there is a way"! Sure enough, on November 7th, the team led by Professor Vincent du Viganeaud of Cornell University in New York announced the successful artificial synthesis of penicillin! After countless failures, and bumping into who knows how many walls, they did not despair, did not lose heart, and did not blame heaven or others. Now they proudly look at the brown crystal, shining brightly, and they also show a victorious smile.</p>
<p>We know that there are at least four different types of penicillin today - type F, type G, type K, and type X. Types F and K penicillin are produced in small quantities and have little application; type K penicillin is rapidly destroyed in the human body (four times faster than type G), and the therapeutic effect is limited; the type circulating on the market is mostly type G penicillin.</p>
<p>The structure of type G penicillin is quite complex. The method carried out by Viganeaud is also similar to the ordinary artificial synthesis method. First, he tries to decompose it into simpler units, tries to imitate them, and then tries to synthesize these simpler units into a complex whole. Professor Viganeaud divided type G penicillin into two slightly simpler units, dextro—penicillamine hycrochlorice and 2—benzyl—4—inethoxymethyleoe—(4)—oxazolone, and then, after countless twists and turns, and unremitting efforts, he finally succeeded step by step.</p>
<p>The manufactured substance certainly has antibacterial properties, but there are many substances with antibacterial properties, which does not prove that it is she - type G penicillin.</p>
<p>"Not afraid of not knowing the goods, but afraid of comparing goods." Scientists know this truth well, so they used the principle of radioactivity to compare goods. It is so spectacular that there is no time to describe it in detail. Let me talk about their principle, which is to take radioactive sulfur (Raoloactiyegulphur) to combine into the molecules of this new drug, and then mix them with the G-type penicillin secreted by "Ms. Penicillium" in nature, recrystallize and recombine them into a compound. At this time, the radioactive sulfur contained in its molecules can be monitored with a "Geiger counter". If they run away on their own, then they are different from natural penicillin. However, they always followed faithfully during all the monitoring process. Thus, science confirmed that "two are one".</p>
<p>Secondly, how to refine this synthetic penicillin into a pure crystal? The method they used was to use two immiscible solvents, one of which has a greater solubility for penicillin, so penicillin gradually concentrates into this solvent. If this is repeated several times, finally, a small pinch of pure brown crystals - the first human-made penicillin - appears in the hands of scientists.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, can this artificial synthesis compete with nature? Not yet. However, all artificial synthesis methods, after commercial application, are always the most economical production methods, so in the near future, there may be cheap penicillin to save all living beings!</p>
<p>However, the reporter believes that what is especially important is that after the successful artificial synthesis of penicillin, it is possible to discover some useful derivatives in chemistry, just as Prontosil has several sulfonamide derivatives, which is also unknown. Professor Viganeaud smiled, the reporter smiled, and the readers will also laugh.</p>

<p>Anecdotes and Common Sense</p>
<h3>Mark Twain and "The Jumping Frog"</h3>
<p>— Dailing</p>
<p>If you have seen the film "The Humor Master", you will definitely feel infinitely interested in the scene of the "Jumping Frog Competition". Now I want to talk to you more about the story of the jumping frog.</p>
<p>Although Mark Twain only wrote the wonderfully interesting story of "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" in 1863, Americans did not truly value it until May 1928. From that time on, photos of big frogs were often published on the front page of Washington newspapers. The death of a famous frog even caused tens of thousands of people to mourn.</p>
<p>In May 1928, the people of Calaveras County organized the first "International Jumping Frog Competition", which is held annually. However, because Mark Twain did not describe the jumping frog rules in detail in his story, they had to formulate some rules themselves, which were surprisingly successful and have been used to this day. According to these rules, the frog must jump three consecutive times, and the farthest one is the champion. The total jumping time for each frog is ten seconds. Several circles are drawn on the ground, each circle being three to five feet apart, and the starting point is the center of the circle. (The reason for drawing circles is to make it easier for bystanders to calculate the distance of the frog jump.)</p>
<p>The frog owner can use a stick or other methods to stimulate the frog to move forward during the first jump, but during the second and third jumps, they must not do anything and must completely rely on the frog's own happiness to determine the outcome.</p>
<p>The Cleverness of the Frog Owner - In the eighteen years since the "Jumping Frog Competition" was held, frog owners have invented many mechanical objects. One person made an electric baton that would cause a vibration when touched to the frog's body. But this was of no use. After the frog shook for a while, it was unhappy and stopped jumping.</p>
<p>Some people tried using injections and pills, and although the purpose was to stimulate, it often made the frog extremely comfortable and fell asleep in the circle halfway.</p>
<p>Another person was very secretive beforehand. When it was his turn to jump, he insisted on keeping his frog in the box because it was trained to jump directly out of the box. He put the box in the circle, opened the lid, and his frog jumped out like a fly, jumping forty feet - almost breaking the record of three world champions combined. Everyone was very suspicious of this "super frog". Upon investigation, it was found that the bottom of the box was attached with a strong spring. As a result, the person was disqualified from the competition, and he made a fool of himself.</p>
<p>Does the Frog Need Training? - Many people eagerly discussed the issue of whether jumping frogs need training. Some winners said that without their care and training, they would definitely not have such good results. But some other people will tell you that they caught the frog from the bottom of the river and immediately rushed to participate in the competition. Although there was no training at all, they easily won the championship.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether training is effective or not, since jumping frogs became an organized sport, the jumping distance has indeed increased day by day. In the early competitions, the winning frogs only jumped three or four feet, but now it is necessary to jump ten to sixteen feet.</p>
<p>Last year, a frog called "Maki" jumped sixteen feet and two inches, setting a new world record. In 1937, someone fed a live bee to his frog, causing it to jump twenty-one feet and four inches. But he still did not win because the frog jumped backwards.</p>
<p>The day before a certain annual competition, a bamboo basket was received with a tag attached: "Handle with care: urgent. Jumping frogs en route to the 'Jumping Frog Competition'." The basket was full of Spanish soil, with two North Carolina frogs inside. They were transported by rail from the Washington Fire Department to participate in the competition.</p>
<p>Those Who Underestimate the Enemy Fail - Bing Crosby specially airlifted a frog to compete, but the frog was probably too arrogant and did not move an inch in ten seconds.</p>
<p>A Parisian carried his pair of French frogs, each weighing one and a half pounds, across the Atlantic Ocean, through the Panama Canal, and then up the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. When one of them "left the pet", it jumped into San Francisco Bay. The heartbroken owner described its jumping posture as "great". The other frog, having lost its companion, had no intention of training and ended up in complete defeat and returned in disgrace.</p>
<p>For eighteen years, Calaveras has become the center of the world's frogs. Thanks to Mark Twain's pen, he made it possible for this interesting "sport" to continue permanently, and also made it possible for some childlike innocence to remain in this noisy world.</p>

<h3>One Hurdle After Another</h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>It hasn't been long since the Gregorian New Year, and the Lunar New Year is coming soon.</p>
<p>Celebrating the new year twice in one year, this repetitive drama is everywhere in China, where new and old ideas are confused and conflicting. Is it just celebrating the new year?</p>
<p>Celebrating the new year twice in one year always feels a bit repetitive and troublesome in terms of emotions. It may not be impossible for rich people to celebrate the new year once more, to have a more lively scene, but for poor people it is not so simple. Celebrating the new year once more means passing one more difficult hurdle.</p>
<p>In one's life, I don't know how many difficult hurdles one has to go through. Since rushing out of the mother's womb and entering the world, it is followed by the school entrance hurdle, the exam hurdle, the graduation hurdle, the job application hurdle, and then running into walls everywhere in society, the layoff hurdle, and the unemployment hurdle come one after another, plus the love hurdle, the marriage hurdle, and the disease hurdle. Women also have an additional childbirth hurdle. Almost until old age and death, they still have to pass a ghostly hurdle. Now, out of thin air, two more New Year hurdles are added each year. The human body is made of flesh and blood, how can it withstand so many difficult hurdles?</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever I recite the sentence: "There is no calendar in the mountains, and one does not know the year when the cold is over," I am always fascinated by it.</p>
<h3>A Few Words from a Worldly Old Man</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiang</p>
<p>A worldly old man is a modern old man; the old man wears glasses on his nose, has a long beard on his cheeks, has a thin face, and is energetic. He looks similar to Santa Claus. He is over seventy years old, but he still walks briskly, walking through the streets and alleys every day, silently observing the current social situation, and likes to read newspapers. He subscribes to newspapers both domestically and internationally. With his unique and insightful ideas, he analyzes and argues, gains something every day, and carefully records it at night. Over the years, he has written thousands of books of talk, which are both humorous and witty. Excerpts of them are presented to the readers.</p>
<p>The old man read the newspaper and saw that the Kuomintang and Communist armies were fighting for the city of Lianshui. When the Communist army retreated and the Kuomintang army entered the city, there were only three old women left in the city. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration provided relief flour, but no one accepted it; the old man first sighed, and then happily said: "What is difficult for people is the liberation of death. Now that the results of liberation are like this, it is really a great good thing to relieve the suffering of the masses from freezing and starvation"!</p>
<p>The old man has several friends who work in educational institutions with very low salaries. His friends came to his residence to complain! The old man calmly said to them: "Salaries are originally only for purchasing salaries. Now that it lives up to its name, who says it is not appropriate."</p>
<p>A wife of a veteran of the War of Resistance complained to the old man that her husband was unfaithful. The old man said with emotion: "The War of Resistance was temporary, and now it is over. Madam can rest." The madam suddenly realized, was disappointed and left.</p>
<p>The old man read the Analects to the sentence "Ancient scholars studied for themselves, and modern scholars study for others" and said: "Which of today's scholars does not study for themselves, who says today's people are not as good as the ancients."</p>
<p>The old man walked on the street and met a county magistrate passing by. The entourage was noisy and pedestrians were prohibited from passing. The old man strode forward with his head held high and was arrested by ××. The old man scolded loudly and said: "The county magistrate is also a human being, and I am also a human being. Why should I fear him"! Before he finished writing, ×× arrested him and put him in prison. The old man began to regret greatly and said: "I regret not being a county magistrate, which led to this disaster"!</p>
<p>One day, a ×× rode a horse across the road and injured a rural woman. The woman cried in pain. The old man passed by and said to her: "This is a road for horses. You walked on the road and were injured by a horse. What is the fault of the horse"?</p>
<p>The old man saw that robbery cases were rampant, so he laughed and said to people: "This is because there are two classes of rich and poor in society. If everyone were poor thieves, then there would be no thieves."</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, the old man was walking in the street. He saw the national flag flying, the city was silent, and passers-by seemed not to know that it was New Year's Day. The old man said when he saw this situation: "The Gregorian calendar is easy to pass, but the Lunar calendar is hard to endure."</p>
<p>The old man saw newspaper advertisements with many marriage and divorce announcements. The content often said "We two are in love with each other and are willing to spend our lives together", "We two have disagreements and it is difficult to spend our lives together", and he often shook his head and sighed: "If I had known today, why did I do it in the first place"!</p>
<p>Public and educational personnel are paid meagerly and work hard to serve the public, never tired. Other workers' compensation is higher than everything else. If there is any disagreement, they will respond with a strike. As a result, it finally comes to their wishes. Someone asked the old man for a method to eliminate labor disputes. The old man dismissed the people around him and whispered: "Let the workers read a few more years of books, like public and educational personnel, and there will be no future troubles."</p>
<p>In a certain province, boys and girls attend the same school, and the old school faction disapproves of this. Therefore, an anonymous poster was made and posted on the gate of a certain school saying: "Wonderful, wonderful, this university is really effective. Before three years are up, it will turn into a Temple of the Child-Giving Goddess." The old man also echoed it in the original rhyme, and the last two sentences said: "Wonderful, you say that boys and girls cannot attend the same school, why are Arhats sculpted in the Guanyin Temple"?</p>
<p>One day, the old man was walking on the street with a Western friend. It was raining and the road was muddy. There was so much mud on the street that it looked like a rice field. The Western friend asked why the road administration did not repair it like this? The old man replied: "This year, the drought is severe and there is little rice. In the future, we will grow wheat and rice on the street." After a while, the Western friend pointed to the green worms hanging up and down the trees on the side of the road, and the spider webs in the air with surprised insects on the ground. What is the meaning? The old man replied again: "This is the silkworm rearing of the Insect Bureau, because foreigners are transporting silk to China, and in the future these natural silks will be used to resist it." The Western friend began to nod and praised: "China is worthy of being a country that pays attention to agriculture."</p>
<p>A friend of the old man plans to work in the post office and relief agency. The friend asked the old man which of the two is the least likely to lead to unemployment. The old man advised him to join the relief agency. The friend asked the reason, and the old man pointed to the street beggar and said: "This kind of work can never be finished."</p>
<p>The old man said: "In the city, if you want to judge a young man, you only need to let him manage money without checking his accounts, and at a certain time, you can put him to death"!</p>
<p>A certain county magistrate, A, wrote a couplet on his door that said: "Love the people like children, enforce the law like a mountain." The old man continued it with: "Love the people like children, cattle and sheep parents, granary parents, just perform their duties as children. Enforce the law like a mountain, hiding reality in it, accumulating wealth in it, is this the nature of a mountain?"</p>
<p>The old man and the leader of the troops were neighbors. The leader used a servant who was stupid and lazy. There was an old-fashioned teapot in the room, which the leader liked very much; one day he told the servant to carry the pot to make tea. After a long time, the servant brought a pot without a lid. The leader asked why he didn't put the lid on. The servant replied that he had broken it. The leader said angrily: "Why didn't you break the pot together." The servant immediately took the pot out and smashed it. The leader became even more angry and beat him and fired him. The old man heard about it and said: "How difficult it is to be absolutely obedient."</p>

<h3>Bean Paste Steamed Bun</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The mayor made a wonderful metaphor at the council meeting and said: "On the one hand, we must take into account the needs of the people, and on the other hand, we must take into account the burden of the people. The city government and the council are like sandwiches sandwiched in the middle."</p>
<p>The lives of Shanghai's four million citizens are all weakly and messily rolled together, surrounded on the one hand by the heavy burden of high prices, high interest rates, heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies, and on the other hand, they must take into account the international city scene. The citizens of Shanghai are like bean paste steamed buns wrapped in the middle.</p>
<h3>Ideals! Reality!</h3>

<p>Ideals and reality, may they one day walk the same path!</p>
<h3>National Essence</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>After Shanghai eliminated the "eating-corner tigers" (a type of gambling), fortune-telling stalls arose to replace them, and recently even the large and small thirty-six kinds of stalls have sprung up in response.</p>
<p>This is a new trend of the people transforming from being infatuated with Western ways to advocating for the national essence.</p>

<h3>Water Beggars (Part 1) – The Predecessors of Water Rats</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The "Water Rat" gang that runs rampant on the Huangpu River has a considerable background. They have deep-rooted historical origins, and are skilled in treading waves and stirring up water, and are active underwater. Stealing cargo from ships, breaking into cabins, cutting mooring lines, and other tricks are all commonplace for them. Although the police have been actively arresting them recently, it is difficult to completely eliminate them in the short term due to the gang's wide connections and numerous resourceful members. Upon investigation, the predecessors of this "Water Rat" gang were the "Wandering Five Lakes," "Playing Green Dragon," and "Water Comb Thoroughly" gangs that were active in the Three Xiang and Seven Lakes regions. During the Qing Dynasty, they already occupied an important position in the Jianghu gangs. In order to understand the predecessors of the "Water Rats," I will patiently and carefully describe what I have learned from inquiries.</p>
<p>Initially, the "Wandering Five Lakes" gang rowed a kind of small boat, specifically begging from "bottom-of-the-barrel" (boats too) docked at the shore. They were "water beggars" and originally belonged to the "Playing Green Dragon" gang. "Playing Green Dragon" was a type of gang that performed and sold their skills on the water, similar to the "Offering Celestial Spirits" gang that performed on land. They just branched out like the army and navy.</p>
<p>The small boats rowed by the "Playing Green Dragon" gang had small ends and a large, bulging middle, shaped like an olive or a large duck egg. They swayed on the turbulent Yangtze River, appearing very dangerous. An old man sat at the stern, holding a small paddle and rowing, while a child, about thirteen or fourteen years old, stood on the bow. Both boys and girls wore tight short shirts and pants, were barefoot, and had their hair tied into a small bun with two red and green flowers inserted in it. The old man whistled while slowly rowing the boat into the crowd. People on other boats would naturally peek out of their windows to watch. The old man would say a few "opening lines," and with a shout, the child would flip and turn on the small bow, which was only about two feet square, performing various tricks while the boat swayed dangerously. If someone threw money into the water, the child would immediately dive in to pick it up. During the Mid-Autumn Festival Stone Lake incense gathering in Wu County during the Qing Dynasty, "Playing Green Dragon" was the time to make money. Unexpectedly, one or two children always died each year. After Magistrate Zhu issued a ban, the "Playing Green Dragon" business suffered a blow and gradually declined. Those who remained dispersed to other places and no longer necessarily "went to the market." They usually just performed miscellaneous tricks at the boat docks to earn enough money to feed their families, a very pitiful situation. When the children turned sixteen, their bodies became stiff and they could no longer make a living in this way, so they had to switch to "Wandering Five Lakes," which was one of the reasons.</p>
<p>However, teaching children the skills of "Playing Green Dragon" was a very difficult task. Because they had to do "waist monkey," "somersaults," "inverted cauldron" (commonly known as hitting the...), "wind circle" (turning around in a circle) and other skills on a boat and a fragile wooden plank without falling, and then practice boat skills before not falling into the water. Only after they had mastered the skills would they practice their underwater abilities. They had to be able to open their eyes in the water and see things in the water so that they could "fish for needles" (pick up money). Only one or two out of ten children could succeed. Some died during practice!</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Growth of a Writer</h3>
<p>— Fu Jun</p>
<p>In the realm of literature, whether it is creation, criticism, or translation, if one wants to achieve a brilliant and immortal achievement, it is of course unavoidable that one must have several parts of talent and the influence of the literary environment out of ten. In addition, first of all, one must have a strong will. This is a great driving force that can promote the writer to embark on the road to growth. Literary critics and writers of ancient and modern China and foreign countries have all achieved amazing success because of their strong will. Those sacred masterpieces, even after hundreds of years, are still cherished by the public, regarded as treasures, and it can be said that they are all based on having a strong will. The great French writer Anatole France began his literary life when he was in his teens and continued until his death in Tours on October 12, 1924. He lived a long life of eighty years and devoted himself to literary work wholeheartedly and never slackened. This strong will is really worthy of imitation by today's literary workers. Mr. Lin Qinnan of our country, as an ancient prose writer who originally did not understand foreign languages, translated The Camellia Lady by the French writer Alexandre Dumas fils after accidentally hearing others' oral accounts, which was welcomed and praised by countless people. This aroused his interest in translation, and he successively translated more than 150 kinds of novels by famous European and American writers. The great works of famous writers from countries such as England, France, the United States, Russia, Greece, Norway, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, and Japan, such as Shakespeare, Dickens, Scott, Alexandre Dumas père, Alexandre Dumas fils, Washington Irving, Tolstoy, Aesop, Ibsen, Weiss, Cervantes, and Tokutomi Kenjiro, were all translated into Chinese by him and introduced to China. His strong will and his unwavering dedication to literature are truly admirable.</p>
<p>In addition to having a strong will, the growth of a writer requires rich life experience. Because literary creation is originally a reflection of various aspects of real life, if there is no rich and enthusiastic life experience, then this writer will not be successful. The famous Russian short story writer Chekhov once said in a letter to his friend Suvorin: "What I write is only my experience... The reason why you and I are outstanding is that you and I like to be close to ordinary people." Famous writers such as Dostoevsky were exiled to Siberia; Gorky used to be a rag picker, a mechanical pattern maker's apprentice, a cook's assistant on a steamer, a lawyer's clerk, and also wandered around. Zola went to the coal mine himself in order to write about the situation in the coal mine. Serafimovich, in his article How I Wrote "The Iron Flood," tells us how he obtained the material for the novel. He said: "I also found those comrades who had marched with him, and I interrogated them like a judge, asking them one after another; after listening to one person, I went to ask the second, the third, and even the tenth. Later, I got a diary - a diary kept by a worker during this march - and so, by referring to the statements of those who had personally participated in this march, I created a true scene of this movement. Sai · Telezhkov worked with Deng Xihua, the protagonist of the book, a journalist, for six months while writing "Deng Xihua." Pilek read more than 30 books on river and sea engineering in order to write a novel called "The Vova River Enters the Caspian Sea."... These facts can all illustrate that the growth of a writer, in addition to a strong will, must also have deep life experience, otherwise, his works will not be easy to achieve both form and content, and be popular with the people.</p>
<p>In the process of a writer's growth, since he has a strong will and rich life experience, he must also know how to "observe" and "imagine" at any time and in any place. Since the object depicted by literary creation is the reality of human life, then for the various postures and personalities of human beings, one must observe them carefully with keen eyes. Gorky said in his "My Creative Experience": "In order to accurately describe a portrait of a worker, a priest, or a small businessman, one must carefully look at his hundreds of priests, small businessmen, and workers." Dickens was most sensitive to "observation." No matter how bustling a street he walked through, he could tell the order of the shops on that street and the various details of how they were decorated. These are all examples of writers' "observation." But we know that observation belongs to the external world, and we must also examine our own inner world and taste the similarities between the personalities and behaviors of human beings, so as to describe the thoughts, feelings, and impulses of the characters. In this way, we must seek help from "imagination." One day, Tolstoy and Turgenev were walking in the wild and saw an old frightened horse passing by. Tolstoy was immediately infected by the horse's emotions and had a strong "imagination." He then vividly described his sad memories. For example, from other kinds of human actions, we can also use our "imagination" to achieve the purpose of deep description in literary works. Therefore, "observation" and "imagination" are indeed indispensable and important factors in the growth of a writer.</p>
<h3>Waterwheel (Oil Painting)</h3>

<h3>Remembering Yu Pingbo</h3>
<p>— Lin Hui</p>
<p>Every middle school student has probably read the two beautiful and lingering articles, "The Qinhuai River in the Sound of Oars and Lanterns." These were written by Zhu Ziqing and Yu Pingbo when they traveled together in Qinhuai, and they became a popular literary anecdote.</p>
<p>Zhu Ziqing has already returned to Beiping, and his recent mood can be seen from "Miscellaneous Notes on Returning." Yu Pingbo has been living in seclusion in the ancient city, so his news is relatively quiet. Although I have recently seen his two articles published in Ta Kung Pao, "Casual Remarks on Poetry" and "A Simple Explanation of Qingzhen Ci" in "The Analects," they are all critical works, and it is difficult to get a glimpse of his life and state of mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu is very short, wearing a pair of deeply nearsighted glasses. The snuff-colored old woolen hat is covered with dust, and the blue cloth gown has been washed countless times. Anyone who meets him for the first time will be surprised by his simplicity and lack of pretense. He is slightly hunchbacked, and his pace is neither fast nor slow, fully revealing a gentle and refined demeanor. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he has a very deep old literati atmosphere.</p>
<p>Whether he is speaking or lecturing, he often grabs the gray hair on his temples with his fingers, which has almost become his habit. And what can best convey his thoughts and wisdom is his bright and radiant eyes, which emit a rational and sincere brilliance. From this, one can understand his ethnic areas and silently read thoughts that are more beautiful than his writing can describe.</p>
<p>He is an introverted person who does not like to talk grandly. He is always immersed in thought. His silence often evokes a feeling of reverence, making one feel that all gorgeousness, exaggeration, and boasting are nothing but a pile of garbage and some burdens. At the same time, his fondness for silence also explains why his articles contain many profound philosophies.</p>
<p>He is a poet, an essayist. His poems are ethereal and natural; his essays are restrained and solemn, with a bit of astringency. If Zhu Ziqing is compared to Yuan Zhonglang of the Gong'an School, then Yu Pingbo is Zhong Xing and Tan Youxia. In any case, his early works, "Yan Zhi Cao" and "Miscellaneous Flavors," have to be said to be the most stylish works of modern prose. Half of the style is due to his talent, and half is due to the completion of his personality; this is why we always hope to see the person in person after reading someone's work. Sometimes, we can get more inspiration from observing his personality and life.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that Yu Pingbo left the position of new literature and moved towards the classics. So he made textual research on "The Analects," gave a simple explanation of Zhou Qingzhen's poems, and explored the musical theory and palace shang of the songs. New creations are rarely seen; this is Yu's loneliness, and it is also the loneliness of the literary world. If going into the classics was an unavoidable escape during the dark eight years, then it is now time to change course. In this turbulent era, the young group is so eager for some seniors to say a few sincere words as their spiritual pillar; they are so eagerly waiting for those who tend to the truth to shoot out a ray of light to pierce the vast darkness...</p>
<h3>Short Poems</h3>
<p>— Lan Ben</p>
<p>Insects</p>
<p>Use antennae as feelers</p>
<p>Use feelers to seek women</p>
<p>Use women to fill up with nectar</p>
<p>I am an insect</p>
<p>I live in the beehive of an urban apartment</p>
<p>Train</p>
<p>Departing from the station…</p>
<p>A giant with a blue, smoky pipe</p>
<p>Followed by</p>
<p>Air filled with the foul odor of nicotine</p>
<p>The noisy clamor of passengers</p>
<p>Departing from the station…</p>
<p>The newest, Dadaism,</p>
<p>A train full of the pain of the end of the century,</p>
<p>The train of life departs,</p>
<p>Spraying blue smoke from my hands…</p>
<h3>Fragments on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>Poetry is the sound of the human heart. When there were people on earth, there was also poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry was a popular art in ancient times, but later it was locked in a greenhouse by some literati and elegant scholars, and separated from the people of the earth. It seems that only they understand poetry, are worthy of talking about it, and are worthy of creating it. In fact, they have stained poetry and put heavy shackles on it.</p>
<p>At that time, when it was imprisoned by the literati, a huge voice rang out among the people, and that was folk songs.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 143</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>It is said that according to the traditional legend of the Black Dragon Society, when a member is dying, whether it is seppuku or suicide due to violating the law, they must shout the slogan "Kyo Kyu Kyu Kyo" (恐急糾舉) in order to be considered an eight-stringed, awe-inspiring, earth-shattering heroic act. Otherwise, they would be scolded as "killers" or "killing material," which would be cowardly and far removed from this official "sacred death" method.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another interpretation of these four words, that is, when high-ranking figures in the society have hardships, their subordinates, upon hearing this emergency command, must desperately move forward and sacrifice everything at all costs, only seeking to protect this high-ranking figure.</p>
<p>The above three interpretations cannot cover everything, but generally speaking, this underworld slang is somewhat of a bad thing, and seems to be closely related to the matter of "death."</p>
<p>So, which type of emergency command did Tsurumi receive? Was he told to quickly commit seppuku? Or was he told to commit suicide? Or was he told to desperately move forward to protect Konoe?</p>
<p>"Mr. Nishihara," Tsurumi stood up straight and struck a military at-attention pose, "I apologize for arriving in a hurry and not bringing my tools. I am empty-handed…"</p>
<p>Tsurumi certainly knew what this emergency command generally meant. However, in this sudden incident with rapidly changing events, it was impossible to be absolutely sure whether this "Kyo Kyu Kyu Kyo" was telling him to risk his life. In addition, that Nishihara was naturally a double-sided face (無表情) no matter what, with no expression on his face. Although he seemed to be in a hurry, he didn't seem to be bringing reinforcements. So he used the words "no tools" to test him and see how he would answer, so he could understand the intention clearly: if Tsurumi was to commit seppuku, then according to the rules, he would have to use his ancestral Japanese sword bestowed by our country; if he was told to commit suicide, he could sneer, "As you please." Apart from these two, no matter what tools he was told to use, pistols, school swords, Chinese swords, etc., he could be sure that he was being told to kill the enemy and achieve results.</p>
<p>"Tagusan, Tagusan!" This is the Japanese pronunciation, meaning "there are many"; that is, it means that Beppu's "tools" are of various kinds and have everything. "The enemy's challenge specifies judo or kendo. It is believed that there are excellent ancient swords here, and you can choose whatever you like."</p>
<p>Tsurumi completely understood this, not only understood, but also calmed down; because competing in judo and kendo was originally a smokescreen in Tsurumi's plan; it could be seen that Konoe had fallen for his trick; in other words, he had fallen into the trap. To go one step further, this meant that his subordinates had completed seven or eight tenths of the work of searching for the "Seven Secret Letters" according to plan. He had to personally take the stage for the remaining two or three tenths.</p>
