<h3>美國重視遠束局勢　派魏德邁特使來華　馬卿計劃將擴展至亞洲</h3>
<p>〔美国新聞處华盛顿十一日電〕白宮本日宣布稱：魏德邁（見圖）將軍即將前往中國及朝鮮，考察該區之一般悄形，魏氏此行任務為調查事質，隨行者將有專家數人，魏氏查望於六週內返美，向杜魯門總統提出考察報告，魏氏此次將以大使衙及杜魯門總統特別代表資格，率頒下列各隨員赴華，財政顧問，財政部遠東司之曾金斯氏，政治顧問，國務院遠東事務司之斯布雷斯氏，工程顧問，海軍部民用工程隊之特克塞爾海軍少將，經濟顧問，國務院經發灸展處之威爾克氏，對外聯絡在問，巴爾的摩太陽報之華生氏。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十一日電社魯門總統特派前中國區美軍司令魏德邁將軍為中國與朝鮮緊急事實調查國團長，率領政治與經濟顧問，前往研究將馬歇爾計劃擴展至中國與遠東一事之可能性。總統此項決議，殆為暗示將改變美國之對華政策，影響國內與中國方面之壓力，以支持蔣主席對共產黨之作戰。魏德邁將軍亦為軍人，適與馬歇爾國務卿相同，今比任此職，眾人咸認為其有重大意義，且聞魏氏對於國民政府與反共中張皆表同情。魏氏今以大使街出任總統之特使，共地位與馬歇爾一年前所担任者相同，但任務之目的則已有分別，馬歇爾以前乃係和平使者，負實調處中國之內戰，而魏氏今之任務則為通盤估計中國與朝鮮之局勢。</p>
<h3>主席及我政府歡迎魏氏來華　王外長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕魏德邁將軍受任為杜魯門總統大使衙特別代表，即將率專家來華。韓考察之消息，於涼雨爽風遍傳首都，朝野人士一致興奮，咸認此舉為美將加強援華之先　，並盼此中國至友，能再度與蔣主席合作，對遠東之安定有所貢獻。王世杰外長以前所未有之速度，代表蔣主席及我政府表示歡迎。王氏於十二日午發表談話稱：「魏德邁將軍被任為杜魯門總統赴華特別代表，蔣主席及中國政府，均表歡迎。魏將軍是中國之老友及摯友，　于戰爭後所在中國戰區服務時，彼對於中國戰區之加強暨中美間之合作，有甚大之貢獻，均為中國人民所深佩。本人深信魏將軍此行，　　增進美國民眾對中國情形之更深暸解，因而增進中美間之友誼與合作。此於逮東一般局勢　　，亦必有裨益」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞發表意見稱：「魏德邁氏熱悉遠東情形，茲奉派前在考察實況，余聞之甚為欣喜，此舉足見美國對遠東局勢之積極關切。遠東局勢，就其國際方面而論，實與全世界之和平，安全及經濟穩定，休戚相關」。</p>
<h3>協助我國政府促進經濟復興　魏德邁特使來華使命</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十二日電〕據此間獲悉：魏德邁將軍使團之赴華，第一目的在研究美國當如何幫助中國國民政府，而不致虛耗其金錢。</p>
<p>美決定派遣高級緊急使節團，乃由下列二原因所促成者：</p>
<p>（一）參院主席范登堡六個月來曾不斷促使美國將共政策重心移至中國。對於國民政府反抗通貨膨脹及共黨，予以協助。</p>
<p>（二）馬歇爾國務卿曾在中國居間調停一年餘，但仍感覺在決定美國應如何能以賓際援助予中國之事實尚不足夠。</p>
<p>美國所以選擇魏德邁任團長，乃因渠素來同情中國國民政府。魏德邁將為美國戰後之第二個駐華高級特使，若干觀察家對其成功之機會表永懷疑，撼悉：魏德邁加担任朝鮮部份之使命，將為次要者。芙官方雖堅稱白宮之聲明並無「隱義」，此團純為「覓取事實」之使團，但觀察家仍認為；此舉可能含有較遠之目的，包括下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）決定協助中國經濟復興之方法，其第一步可能為上週商務部長所暗永者，馬歇爾計劃將擴展至亞洲。</p>
<p>（二）決定美國在許多個月保守中立後，是否應以正義及物質之全力支持蔣主席，對中共作戰。</p>
<p>（三）分析美·蘇關於組織朝鮮臨時政府之談判情形，以決定美國將否在南韓單獨行動，猶如馬歇爾國務卿前在莫斯科外長會議時所已提出者。</p>
<p>（四）提供關於朝鮮軍事政府能否代以民政管埋，而交國務院接管之意見，二億美元之特別援助朝鮮計劃，現仍在研究中，尚未交與國會。</p>
<p>〔又電〕驗華公使銜參贊白德華，將於十四日向馬歇爾國務卿報告關於馬卿正月離華後中國局勞蠻化情形。傳白德華可能繼范宣德出任國務院遠東司司長。按范宣德曾被親南京人土斥為不同情中國國民政府者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕杜魯門總統與馬歇爾國務卿任命魏德邁為調查中國及朝鮮特使，首次使中·韓爾國聯在一起，指示美國現己認為兩國有一共同問題需要解決。外國曾屢傳韓共在東九省作戰，即為此項發展之一部份原因。惟美政府選派魏德邁至中國，表示其僅將在政府方面從事調查。此間觀察家認為：蘇聯未能將旅大行政權交還中國，將為魏氏調查中之要目。觀魏氏此次任命，預料美國在兩個月內將採取對華新政策。</p>
<h3>加強遠東政策調查中韓局勢</h3>
<p>民青兩黨歡迎魏氏</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕此間某權威人士稱，魏德邁將來華，韓「調查事實」一事，殆為美國加強遠東政策之開端。馬帥就任國務卿半載以來，其對遠東之政策，遠不若對歐積極，最近旅大問題，北塔山事件，漢城談判在在　示美國當局有重行考慮其遠東政策之必要。該權威人士並指出；魏氏之任命，適在美國撤消對華軍火禁運令之後，魏氏來華時期，又適在我國厲行全國總動員之際，其重要性自不待言。</p>
<p>〔又電〕青年黨府委余家菊，十二日就魏德邁將來華事語記者，魏使此行，對我國當前經濟方面，將有莫大助益，故對美國貸款更抱樂觀態度，惟渠認為：魏氏此行，在軍事方面不致有何作用。民社黨府委胡海門對記者表示，美總統能派特使來華，賓為吾人所極表歡迎者，同時，對中·美間之友誼，當更能有所增進</p>
<h3>紐約各報強調中美關係增進</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十一日電〕紐約各報雖未評論魏德邁之新任務，然各報之報導俱強調：「此乃反映馬歇爾對中國局勢之關切，以及其對此戰時駐華美軍總司令之信任者」。紐約時報之報導稱：「一般認為魏德邁之新任命，已使中國憂慮美國將　其不顧一點，為之冰釋。同時盛傳魏氏將織司徒當登任駐華大使一說，亦告澄清」。時戰稱：「傳魏氏對此一職他無興趣，然卒被勸服而擔任此次調套工作」。該報華盛頓記者稱：「吾人若欲預測此舉是否將造成杜魯門政策下所推行之經濟及其他援助或造成馬歇爾計劃之擴展至亞洲，則尚嫌過早。傳魏氏對此項政策，心中頗為暸然。渠之任務即在決定美國對促進中國復員一事，研能有何作為。一般認為魏氏對設法促成國共團結方面之興趣，遠不如其更深刻研究該國之各種困難方面之興趣」。</p>
<h3>中荷民航協定草案咋日簽署</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕中荷空運協定，經六次談判，即將草案究成，十二日上午十一時，我方主持談判之交通部顧問凌士芬，與荷方代表團團長杜森，在交部會議室簽署雙方初步商洽完成之草案，互賀談判之順利成功，協定草案之內容，大致依據芝加哥國際民航會議所擬之標準協定，刻雙方即將草案分別送呈兩方政府核准，然後由荷大使及中國外交部長代表兩國簽字。杜森等一行，定于十三日離華返國。</p>

<h3>中國人民的友人：魏德邁將軍</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>去年四月初，魏德邁將軍結束了中國戰區的美軍總部，功成返國，行前曾在上海舉行最後一次的記者招特會，席上中外記者代表先後致飼，對於魏將軍的品格與成就深致敬意，並且一致說，希望魏將軍他日能再　新命，重返中國，現在，這中國人民的友人，果然又以大使銜出任杜魯門總統的特別代表，準備再來中國了。</p>
<p>魏德邁將軍的名字是和中國的勝利聯在一起的，他在抗戰末期出任中國戰區的參謀長，幫助中國獲得了抗戰的勝利，又担負起了战后遺送日俘返國的艱钜上作。三十三年秋天，正是我國抗戰史上最黑暗的時期，常時日軍在中國大陸上傾巢進犯，想打通粵漢綫，西南重鎮的桂林城外正展開猛烈的戰鬥。就在道時候，魏將軍繼史迪成將軍之後，出仕中國戰區美軍總司令，兼中國戰區司令部的參謀長，輔佐蔣主席，訓練軍隊，補充裝備，抵禦住了敵人的進攻。在魏將軍就任後的一年中，中國戰區的局勢日見改觀，終於，到三十五年入月，日本屈膝投降了。</p>
<p>魏將軍是一位身經百戰的軍人，而且　富　略。第一次世界大戰結束前十日，他畢業於西點軍校，從來在參謀大學和德國柏林的陸軍大學中都研究過軍事。一九三〇年間，他曾被派到中國，在天津美軍中駐留過一個短時期。珍硃港事變後，他任職陸軍部的戰略委員會，對於盟國作戰方略的決定，曾有不少貢獻。一九四三年十月，他被派到東南亞盟軍總部任副參謀長，從此和亞洲的戰局發生了關係。由於他的勇敢，才智和敏達，不久即被任命為中國戰區的美軍總司令。</p>
<p>這位功勳彪炳的將軍從美國人的觀點說，實在還年輕得很。他生於一八九六年，算起來今年還只五十歲，他有著瘦瘦的身材，一個筆直的鼻子，淺灰色頭髮，一雙柔和的眸子裏閃耀著一稱嚴備的深遂的光芒。他不大會喝酒，但香烟却吸得不少，跟別人談話的時侯，他那種輕緩而沉著的聲音，常給人以十分深刻的印象。</p>
<p>魏將軍自己說：他愛中國，愛中國一切的人民。那年常他接任中國戰區的職務時，他說：「我愛他們，我來是為了想為他們服務」。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕政院預算審查委會，十二日晨九時舉行第二次臨時會議，五雲五主席，討諭主題為文武職人員同等待遇一案，內分（一）薪餉，（二）副食費，（三）馬乾薪餉問題，原則上與文職人員同等待遇，但以武職人員之階級與職務與文職人員有所不同，如武職科員有為少校或中校，亦有上校渚，如以將·校·尉與簡·荐·委相比，則與現職又有所差別，如以職務與文職官員相比，則與原有武聯階級又有差別，今日討論未獲結果，決交政院會計處會同國防部磋商後再議。副食費則己增為每人待月五萬元。馬乾依每匹卅萬元計算。關於準備第二綫兵力問題所需費用，會中亦提出討論。</p>

<h3>新疆北塔山正面外蒙軍趕築工事　軍方人士注意次一行動</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化十二日電〕頃由軍方獲悉，北塔山正面白揚溝口之蒙軍馬匹，已減少三分之二，　軍正趕築工事中，此間軍方人士對此極為重視。某軍事觀察家稱：自六月五日蒙軍入寇起，至令已三十餘日，每次蒙軍均　以優勢兵力進攻，而均為我擊退，總計一月以不，蒙軍進攻達十次以上，戰爭初起時，蒙軍在飛機掩護下血戰晝夜，終於損兵折將而回，想蒙方常已深悉我將士保衛國土之決心及作戰之英勇，為圖奪取此軍略要點之北塔山，勢非發動大規模之軍事行動不可。目前蒙軍之行動，當於下列途徑中選擇：（一）放棄搶佔北塔山之企圖，（二）轉移兵力於他處，以圖迂　我陣地後方。前者，就蒙軍之侵略野心及某方危害中國之意圖觀之，顯不可能，故吾人應特別注視蒙軍之次一行動，加緊戒備，以免遭暗算。又訊：北塔山守軍，聞悉中央頒布總動員令後，極為振奮。</p>

<h3>節約綱耍已擬定　即交全經委會大會討論　張嘉稱五億貸款有望</h3>
<p>〔本報　京十二日電〕張院長所提「厲行節約消費辦法」，全國經委會小組會十二日午後開會時，曾　進一步研計，並已擬定「厲行節約消費辦法綱要」，俟将文字整理后，即可于下星期四大會中提出。今日會議由王雲五召集，出席谷正綱·何浩若·黃元彬·樓桐蔣等，會中決定分由公務　　及一般社會兩方面同時進行節約，而對上海尤為重視，務期一切　費咸能節減。即如實　。汽油等，亦力求減省。又上次全體會時，有人建議實行生產合理化，今日會中討論時決另議辦法。</p>

<p>共黨摧殘東北經濟</p>
<p>〔聯合祇瀋陽十二日電〕東北經濟受內戰打擊與貿易條例束縛，正在　　中，東北處境之艱困，可以中紡公司為例，中紡公司雖有政府管理與專賣之一切便利，正陷於停頓狀態。十五萬錠子中，僅一萬至兩萬錠活動。錦州一廠一蹶不振，隨時可以停閉。共軍　　　力廠，乃為遼陽·營口各廠停工之主因。東北糧食案稱富饒，今年卻難有糧食運入關內或其他地點。東北所有出產，現須供當地軍民。</p>
<p>華北最近　荒，平津代表團曾來訂購糧食六萬噸，但因當地自給不足，終於取消合同。此種情形　日本佔領時代適成嚴酷之對照。日軍每年自東北運出高粱·大豆·小麥及小米約三百五十萬噸　其中兩百萬噸運往日本，其餘運往蘇聯與歐洲。近月來糧價高漲，碾　廠缺乏電力開工，為漲價原因之一。東北主要出產之大豆，去年輸出廿四萬噸，今年輸出尚不滿四萬八千噸。聞中共方面經由蘇聯轍出之大豆為數甚巨。政府方面稱，此可於倫敦豆價波動為證明。今年初倫敦豆價為每噸四十七鎊，後即跌至卅五磅。此種悄形，當非　府轄境大批出口致。</p>

<h3>共軍阻撓黃河復堤　水利發表經過　大汛即屆如有潰決共方應負責</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕水利部十二日發表共匪阻撓黃河復堤工程經過。於列舉事實後，指出共匪處心積慮，蓄意壞河工，所派代表建議商談，不過為其潛圖渡河竄擾南岸之烟幕。大汛即屆，將來河防苟有潰決，其責任應由共匪負之。該部對聯總以人力物力協助我搶修河防，表示感謝</p>
<p>四至六月修防工作</p>
<p>據水利部公布：本年四月至六月，冀境高村劉莊兩處險工，先後完成磚柳壩工廿一道，護岸工程一·五七〇公尺，後創堤身及堤頂土中土方工程九九·四〇〇公方，次險工程堵築蘭通，毛店，老君堂，堡城等處串溝平工堤段，塡築交通溝，修補水溝浪窩等殘缺工程二七·五〇〇公方，加培大堤土方工程完成百分之九十，共計一〇四萬餘公方，魯境朱口董莊兩處險工，及朱口至輩莊長廿五公里之堤埝，至六月底止，已將有名巨險之朱口大壩十一道，埽十四段，董莊大壩十二道，埽三十四段，及朱口至董莊一段土工究成。豫境內各工大堤亦在積極趕修，並堵復沁河總段之五車口東虹橋兩處決口。一一一省修防工作均預定於七月十日前完成，但因共匪突於六月卅日大舉渡河，工程悉受影響，而自四月十一日起，共方之協商建議亦證實其毫無誠意。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>歡迎魏德邁將軍來華！</h3>
<p>華盛頓白宮於十一日正式宣佈，杜魯門總統已任命魏德邁將軍爲特使，以大使銜率領由政治經濟問題專家所組織之事實調查團，前往遠東，調查中韓兩國的實際情勢，於六個星期內，完成報吿書，返國覆命。這一個重要的宣佈，不僅可以視爲美國擴大杜魯門主義及於遠東的表示，而且也是美國卽將改變其對華政策的開始。據美國合衆社的報道，魏德邁將軍奉命前來遠東實地調查的任務有四：（一）決定如何穩定中國之經濟，俾在亞洲亦能實施馬歇爾國務卿的援助計劃；（二）查明美國應否放棄其對中國內戰之中立地位，而以道義的物質的力量，支持中國國民政府；（三）分析美蘇談判組織朝鮮臨時政府陷於僵局的情形，以決定美國在朝鮮南部應否單獨行動；（四）考案朝鮮的軍事形勢，以決定朝鮮政府應否由美軍移交國務院管理。僅以此四點而論，也就可如魏德邁將軍東來任務的重大了。</p>
<p>每當中美關係遭遇嚴重老騐時，常常使我們想起魏德邁將軍。去年七八月間，馬歇爾元帥在華調處國共糾紛遭遇困難時，也曾一度盛傳魏德邁將軍或將來華，協助馬帥促成中國和平統一；今年六月底，因爲五億貸款的未能放出，使中美關係又遭遇一大考騐，於是魏德邁將軍來華的傳說，也就紛至沓來。到了現在，魏德邁將軍奉命來華的傳說，終於實現了。記得魏德邁將軍於一九四四年秋季來華就任中國戰區美軍總司令兼任　蔣委員長之參謀長時，正是中國抗戰最艱苦的時期，國軍不僅在戰塲上處處遭受挫折，而且在物質方面也感覺到非常的貧困；配備不全，營養不足，幾乎無法與事事均佔優勢的敵軍作戰。但魏德邁將軍來華之後，本着他「中美士兵應平等待退」的信念，加緊訓練中國軍隊，並予以美式配備，未及數月，不僅中美關係益見密切，中美士兵在中國戰塲上駢肩作戰，幾乎成爲生死相共的患難之交，而且中國也有了美式配備的軍隊三十九師之多，經鍋魏德邁將軍「金箴軍規」的訓練，均能友好而不附和，民主而不放縱，坦白而不抑制。從此，中國的戰塲日見改觀，一年之後，日本終於屈滕投降，中國艱苦抗戰了八年，也就獲得了最後勝利。魏德邁將軍的功績，在我們中國人的心版上，自然永遠不會磨滅的。魏德邁將軍淤去年四月初返國，先後在中國兩年之久，他不但是蔣主席的如己，深如　蔣主席的個性及其特長，曾讚美蔣主席是「一個眞正的基督敎徒，不知有己，但如援助人民，」而且也是我們中國人民之友。他最瞭解中國人的感情及其願望；故當他離滬返國時，不如有多少人爲其惜別，他也有不忍離去的辛酸，就是他回國以後，仍是念念不忘中國。現在魏德邁將軍隔了一年又三個月之後，舊地重遊，雖爲時甚暫，但一定倍覺親切。如我們所知，魏德邁將軍本已熟悉中國的政情，不待調查當可知其底蘊；惟我們仍要指出，在魏德邁將軍返國的一年又三個月期間，中國不論在政治上，經濟上，社會上，文化上，均已發生了多多少少的變化，司徒大使知之甚稔，魏德邁將軍來華後，除了實地　查而外，自然還須多多聽取司徒大使對於中國政治經濟的意見。</p>
<p>我們竭誠歡迎魏德邁將軍暨代表團諸君此番來華作深刻的調查。我們終覺得有若干美國人士對於中國的實際情形，因走馬看花關係，認識或尙嫌不够，尤其是少數作家，不免以耳爲目，回國後在報章雜誌上發表寫作，在美國讀者看來，以爲是他親身經歷的事實，信以爲眞，但在我們看來，實感詫異。例如美國女作家史特朗女士，於去年十月間到東北去了一次，到今年五月在亞美雜誌上發表一文，題爲一共產政體在東北」，可以說她完全受了中共的欺騙，只看到東北中共區的表面，而不知其實際上的運用，因此所有的報道，完全與事實不符。老實說，在今日中美兩國人民之間，還存在着若干本來不應有的誤解，所以我們最歡迎美國各界人士，尤其是洞明政治經濟而有實際經騐的專家，能到中國來看過明白。此番中國之友魏德邁將軍及其同行的政治經濟專家來華實地調查，我們所以必須竭誠歡迎者，其意義在此。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要向中國政府說幾句話：魏德邁將軍調查團此次來華，實地調查中國的政情，其意義重大，不僅有關中國，而且對遠東大局與整個世界的前途，也將有所貢獻。中國政府應將本國的內情，眞誠坦白的相吿。中國目前的弱點爲何？病根何在？都應該就其所知，逐一吿如魏德邁將軍，作爲他起草報吿書的參老。諱疾忌醫，病家所宜力戒。我們千萬不能在良醫診斷時，意圖有所隱瞞。國家大局太嚴重了！世界大局的演變也眞不可料了！我們總得立卽先自反省一下，凡是自己力能解決的問題，務須趕快自謀解決之道，切不可存心事事求助於也人。而且美國縱使存心援華，存心援助國民政府，也必須我們的政府先能做到極端淸廉而又富有工作效率，先能做到處處尊重人民的權益，顧念人民的福利，與人民眞正打成一片，名副其實的是一個「國民政府」，使司徒大使所稱「人民擁護的政府」實實在在爲魏德邁將軍調查團在中國所親眼見到，然後美國定必樂意盡力以援助此有新興氣象的中國。</p>

<p>歐洲經濟會議已於昨日在巴黎開幕，在歐洲所有廿七國之中，除英法兩邀請國而外，僅到義，奧，比，荷，希，士，瑞典等十四國代表，而蘇聯及其八個附庸國，均拒絕邀請不參加會議。據合衆社十一日報道，蘇聯將向巴黎會議發動反攻，組織中歐及東歐經濟集團，與之對抗。同時莫斯科電台，又有「莫洛托夫計劃」的宣佈，歐洲的分裂，殆成定局，似乎不可復「合」了。這實在是人類大悲劇的開始！</p>
<p>蘇聯懷疑馬歇爾計劃的用意，拒不參加巴黎會議，是蘇聯自己的事情，誰也不能勸阻，我們也沒有意見。但是在波蘭，阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞，芬蘭，匈牙利，捷克，南斯拉夫與羅馬尼亞八國，在大戰期間遭受砲火的摧毀，現在欲言復興繁榮，亟待外國的援助，爲什麼要拒不參加歐洲經濟會議呢？除了蘇聯的壓力而外，實在找不出別的理由可以解釋。尤其是捷克，早已表示願意參加巴黎會議，但是當捷克總理及外長一到了莫斯科，就中途變卦，向英法要求收回覆文，不願參加巴黎會議。小國外交的不能自主，强國的支配着小國，終不免做得太露骨了吧。</p>
<p>歐洲分裂了，强權政治復活了，使我們覺得眞正的和平，離開這個世界，也似乎更加遼遠了，更加渺茫了！</p>

<h3>英法外長出席歐洲會議　促歐陸經濟合作　仍盼東歐諸國改變初衷　實施馬卿計劃並非組織反蘇集團</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十二日廣播：討論馬歇爾援歐計劃之歐洲會議，今日在此揭幕，貝文與皮杜爾均出席致詞，否認此次會議係侵害歐洲各國之主權與獨立，並强調會議對於歐洲經濟復興之重要性。主席貝文在其演詞中，向蘇聯及其八附庸國聲明「會議之門，依然洞開」。任何國家如能改變態度，參加馬歇爾計劃，均所歡迎。貝文續稱：「蘇聯及若干歐洲國家未能參加，至以為　，但各該國內心中，亦必有遺憾。」貝文聲明：此次會議並不準備設立永久機構，與聯合國對抗，但為解決歐洲經濟問題，實有成立各該專門委員會之必要。皮杜爾致詞，略謂：「大會之召集，其目的不在成立反蘇集團，主要任務，乃在改善歐洲之紊亂經濟狀態」。今日會議，為時僅一小時，為歷來會議之最短促者。大會首先一致推選貝文為主席，解即進行討論組織程序，成立工作委員會，準備大會之程序，後由貝文宣佈延會，定星期日下午四時舉行第二次會議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十二日電〕歐洲會議之開幕式告成後，工作委員會立即開會，一致推舉法國外交部經濟可長亞爾芳為主席，法國外交部國際會議技術服務組長塞魯勒為秘書長。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十二日電〕西歐十六國代表今日齊集法外部大餐廳開始討論美國務卿馬歇爾援歐復興計劃。戰爭結束以來，蘇聯不參加歐洲重大會議，以此為　矢，足見東西歐分裂情形之嚴重。會議將先行組織若干委員會，分頭硏究歐洲各國自助，及需美國資助之程度，義大利以平等地位參加　大國際會譏，亦為戰後第一次。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十一日電〕外交部今日宣佈，皮杜爾外長將竭力主張巴黎經濟會議完全公開。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十二日廣播：莫斯科廣播電台今日聲稱，市歐各國不參加馬歇爾歐洲計劃會議，並非歧視馬歇爾計劃，主因在於各强國不　經過英法之手與美國商討。各該國願與美國直接交易。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十一日電〕莫斯科電台評述員稱：阿爾巴尼亞·保加利亞·捷克·芬蘭·匈牙利·波蘭·羅馬尼亞及南斯拉夫等八國拒絕參加巴黎會議，可覘知巴黎會議必將失敗。據云：八國之拒絕，已使英法之計劉大受影響，英法業已回復至慕尼黑之危險政策云。</p>
<h3>馬卿向參院外委會說明　美援歐計劃現狀　蘇聯拒不合作使東西裂痕益深</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕國務卿馬易爾十一日在參院外交委員會秘密會議中報吿稱：美國援助歐洲之努力，因蘇聯之拒絕參與歐洲復興計劃而遭受打擊，但不致因此而顚覆。在九十分鐘之秘密會議中，馬歇爾仍希望最後可使蘇聯參加歐洲經濟復興之長期計劃。傳馬氏曾吿該委員會稱：蘇聯目前雖拒絕合作，但渠希望經濟計劃仍可進行。渠認為目前殊無成立法案，以制定經濟復興計劃之必要，並暗示在明春之前，該計劃或不致提付國會討論。但此項行動如屬必要，則本年內亦有成立法案之可能。馬氏並謂：蘇聯之拒不參加巴黎會議，使歐洲分為東西陣綫之裂痕益趨擴大，而蘇聯復向捷克等國施加壓力，迫其不得參與巴黎會議，於是裂痕更深。傳馬歇爾復吿參議員稱：美國必須保持相當强大力量，足以應付任何事變。渠要求美國之經濟與軍事力量應有充分準備。在委員會質詢之下，傳馬氏答稱：關於蘇聯拒絕與美國及其他西方列强合作事，國務院尙不知蘇聯將進行到何等地步云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十二日電〕馬歇爾與參院外委會進行秘密會議後所透露之情報，證明美國以為門戶尙須開放，對歐洲整個復興計劃再作一度嘗試，以免西方國家與蘇聯永成分裂之局面。同時亦可由美國對於塔斯社所傳「莫洛托夫計劃「及蘇聯即將宣佈」復興東歐計劃」等消息拒不表示反應　一事，覘知其態度。</p>

<h3>蘇擬就莫洛托夫計劃　抵制美對外援助　謀組織中東歐經濟集團</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十一日電〕莫斯科廣播電台本日宣稱：蘇聯現已擬就共本身之復興計劃，其效力較之任何復興歐洲之外國援助為優，此項計劃稱之曰「莫洛托夫計劃」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十一日電〕此間及巴黎外交界人士在巴黎會議開幕之前夕，預測蘇聯即將對之發動反攻，組織中歐及東歐經濟集團。西歡十六個國家之代表團已在巴黎集中，定十二日召開關於美國經濟援助復興歐洲最後機會之會議，而蘇聯及其勢力範圍下之八個國家則已採取牴制行動，故外交家僉謂，莫斯科殆將迅速進行東歐之反攻計劃，俾可顧及不參加巴黎會議各國之利益，而蘇聯之主要困難並不在能招到東歐集團國家之多寡，而在蘇聯能否有充份物資援助諸國，俾與美國援助西歐國家者相頡頏。該方面又指出，蘇聯前曾要求馬歇爾計劃中百分之八十，供其復興之用，蓋蘇聯之原料及製成品本感缺乏，故蘇聯恐僅能以極少之資物供應附庸國，準此而論十二日之巴黎會議勢將形成歐洲之分裂局面。</p>
<p>東歐醞釀　互助制度</p>
<p>東歐國家現似已在蘇聯勢力範圍內形成一互相協助」之制度，捷克與波蘭政府聞將在數日內成立「兩國經濟合作委員會」，討論兩國工業生產合作。按捷波兩國於上週簽訂一商業條約。同時，捷克與波蘭曾宣稱，彼等即將與匃牙利開始長期商業協定之談判，捷克八月一日起將以焦煤，鐵，銅及　土礦石輸往匃牙利，協助其完成三年計劃，按捷匃臨時商約最近已吿成立，將於八月初在匃京開始另一談判，使臨時商約成為永久商約。匃牙利商務代表團將同時赴華沙與波蘭締結匃波商約，匃牙利政府並已命令主要重工業工廠以價値二千萬美元之工廠設備，機械及鐵路車輛輸往南斯拉夫，以協助完成南斯拉夫之五年計劃。同時，捷克對現在莫斯科舉行之蘇捷商業談判國，引為滿意，並稱，蘇捷邊境之開那城中已築有新棧房一所，以裝卸雙方之貨物。保加利亞現亦正與蘇聯舉行經濟談判，保國共產黨副總理科斯多夫半週已自莫斯科返保京，擴歸一協定，規定蘇聯以價值一千萬元之機械供給保國，助其實施兩年計劃，保國則以同樣價値之一烟葉運往蘇聯。保國資源部長薩　洛夫今仍留花莫斯科，俾便賡續談判。此外，蘇聯將派代表團至保京討論設立保蘇航空公司之細則，芬蘭與保加利亞相距雖遠，但亦在計劃增進兩國之經濟關係。保國外交部國外貿易司長所領導之商業代表團，現正在芬京談判芬保商業協定。</p>
<h3>美援土協定簽字　供給欵項用於充實國防</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十二日廣播；美土援助協定，今在土京簽署土方代表為土外長河加，美代表為美駐土大使威爾遜。簽字後土國外長謂此項協定，不特增進兩國友好關係，且將維特世界和平。該恊定第一條款，規定土耳其必須善為利用美方借款。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕美國與土耳其今日在安加拉簽訂一億元之軍事援助協定，以保證土耳其反抗蘇聯之壓力而取得「自由與獨立」。該協定係　於聯合國　章之議本主義及建樹美土兩國間之友善關係，於五月廿二日經美國會批准。</p>
<p>蘇聯之威脅並未在該約中正式述及，然戰後蘇聯在土東部邊境之威脅，已引起神經戰爭而使土全國軍隊動員。一億元借款將全部用於軍事之設備，訓練及其他項目，例如建設土國鐵路，加速軍隊及物資之運轍。此協定與希臘方案相反，希臘方案中一半供軍用，餘一半供民用。根據協定，在三種情形下，援助當予以停止：（一）若出於土耳其之要求；（二）若聯合國安理會或大會認為此協定「不需要或不相宜」；（三）若美總統為美國之利益而決定取消此協定。</p>

<h3>勾串圖利損害國庫　楊安仁詹蓮生判罪　金欵未收遽付黃金廿五億顯屬違法　林鳳苞尚無共同勾串證據宣告無罪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動全國之金潮案，自三月十四日地院審理以來，歷時四個月，昨晨宣判。在未開庭前，被吿前央行業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，（着漢灰色西裝）靜坐於刑八庭。至九時卅分汪家焯推事升座後，即提在押被吿金號業公會理事長詹蓮生，林楊亦隨之步入被吿欄內。楊居中立，林右詹左。詹蓮生着湖色綢抱。汪推事宣讀判決書主文：「楊安仁共同對於主管事務直接圖利，處有期徒刑七年，褫奪公權十年。詹蓮生，共同對主管事務直接圖利，處有期徒刑四年，褫奪公權五年。林鳳苞無罪。」在推事繼即坐下略述判決理由，幷曉諭，如不服所判，可向高院聲請覆判。此時林以右手支願靜聽，楊詹則聆判默然，并無表示。末庭諭詹蓮生還押，林鳳苞，楊安仁仍交原保。</p>
<h3>判決理由全文</h3>
<p>理由：一，關於楊安仁詹蓮生部份，按配售黃金政策，直接影響國民生計，間接關係國家命脈，執行此項職務者應如何警惕以收成效。中央銀行辦理黃金買賣由業務局副局長即被吿楊安仁專司其事。被吿楊安仁執行此項國策後，對於所配售之黃金，金款未收，黃金先付，配售黃金時，不憑傳票，更無原始憑證可查，並准以支票購金，發生退票流弊，致使國家黃金政策轉爲投機商人所操縱，手續上不能謂無錯誤。查央行配售黃金慣例，下午成交者因票據交換所停止交換關係，須次日交割，迭據被吿楊安仁供明在卷。核閱央行賬册，本年二月八日收同豐餘金號國幣二十五億零三百三十五萬元之票據，當日黃金已經付出，而此項票據未經交換及換取申請書，有央行本年六月廿七日送本院賬表備考欄內之批注可證。此項票據收入旣在票據交換所交換時間停止後，依上開慣例，即係下午成交，應俟次日交割之黃金。在本年二月初間，黃金市價高漲，一日數變。當此時期，以應於次日交割之黃金，提前</p>
<p>右起：詹述生，楊安仁，一日交付，而利用票據交換時間停止，遲一日轉賬，已難謂非勾結圖利。此觀本年五月十五日財部奉國府令派調查滬市金潮案報吿書稱：「查此類票據國行雖已收進，但並未入賬，即黃金業已付出，而僅收到一紙票據，類似賒賣黃金。目票據是否空頭，亦不無可慮。在表面上國行雖未予各行莊以透支或拆款之事，但其實已予各行莊以資金週轉之利」。及同日檢查央行稽核處央行監事會檢查央行業務局買賣黃金檢察官報吿書稱：「當日收款，自應當日轉賬，如當日票據存庫抵款，逐日遲延，無形中即有一部資金，爲市塲所套用」各等語，尤是揭發無遺。况二月八日係州政府對於金業配售黃金最後一日，依下午成交次日交割之慣例，次日即二月九日，係星期日十日即經停配，不得交割，被吿楊安仁明知配與同豐餘金號，依例須次日交割，而次日受停配影響，不得交割之黃金，提前於八日完成手續，非特與被吿詹運生勾結圖利，昭然若揭，且損害國庫，莫此爲甚。尤有進者，黃金之性質，類似貨幣，一經取得，即可獲利。今被吿楊安仁，米收金款，遞將大量黃金，給與被吿詹蓮生，俾串同圖利，屬實毫無疑義。（理由書全文未完，接下角）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國民政府林故主席遺囑，曾以所藏歷代名家　畫捐充尙幹林森職業學校基金。中委陳其采及吳市長，潘議長，杜月笙等，特遵遺囑與林故主席遺屬商妥後，定於本月十六日起至二十日止，在貴州路湖社舉行林故主席遺物展覽會。昨日下午四時舉行預展，此次展覽書畫精品共計三百餘件，均非常名貴，計有宋朝李迪秋蘆花豸圖，猿松圖，文徵明草書，袁枚行書，郞世寗人物中堂，元人洗象圖，朱熹及明方孝孺眞跡，黃塡草書，宋朝御窰蓬花碟，康熙瓷靑花大華筒，黃銅製三頭六臂，乾隆大吉瓷板等。展覽會負賣人並於昨晚七時邀請名書畫家吳湖帆，馬公愚，鄭午　，紅薇老人以及地方名流等會同評價，以作標售標準。據該會當局稱，此次標售價目並不昂貴，最低每件在數十萬左右，最高亦不超過二千萬元。林故主席遺物，一部分前曾在京展覽，當時前往欣賞及購置者甚衆。（附圖爲遺物書畫兩幅本報攝）</p>
<h3>外商公用事業　營業稅額驚人　市財政一筆龐大收入　請豁免認無充分理由　一旦通過照納三公司難免漲價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市外商公用事業，如美商電力公司，法商電燈電車公司，美商電話公司等，前以曾與英工部局訂有營業協定，已另繳納稅款，請予免征營業稅一案，經與直接稅局反復請駁，幷經數度呈由財政部解釋，迄成懸案，按自營業稅劃歸地方後，各該公司以從前契約關係，一再申請免繳營業稅，幷以參議會通過公用事業附加市政建設捐後，該公司等實不勝再加負擔，而美商電話公司復加行三十二年「中美條約」，以爲免稅口實。記者以本案關係外商今後在華之納稅義務，特分訪財政局及公用局負責人，詢問本案究應如何解釋，方爲合理。據稱：以前各外商公司與工部局所定契約，為一種「報酬金」，與應納營業稅根本爲兩事，至公用事　附加市政建設捐，則係用戶所負擔，公司不過代征性質，更無負擔可言。故外商之抗繳營業稅，實無充分理由。</p>
<p>估計年納二四零億</p>
<p>茲據記者探悉：本市美商電力公司六月份營業額為二四，九四四，四〇二，二六二元，法商電車公司爲四，一二一，七一二，二八〇元，美商電話公司爲四，四六二，五五〇，六一二元（此項營業額，係從六月份各該公司所繳附加市政建設捐百分之十所推算，即照捐額乘十所得之數字，即其每月營業收入）。倘照百分之一，五納營業稅，則美商電力公司每月應納營業稅三七四，一六六，〇三三元，法商電車公司每月應納六一，八二五，六八四元，美商電話公司每月應納六六，九三八，二五九元。三公司共計應繳營業稅五〇二，九二九，九七六元，以全年計算，應爲六，〇三五，一五九，七一二元。惟是上項營業額，均包括尙未實收之數字，加以本市公用事業，近來均已漲價若干倍，倘平均僅以四倍計算，則此三項公用事業，每年應納營業稅將達二百四十餘億之鉅。在各公用事業公司，雖屬重大負擔，但在市財政方面，則更屬鉅額收入，故市政府方面，恐難放棄。</p>
<p>搜集資料縝密研究</p>
<p>關於美商電話公司所加行之中美條約第七條中規定：「中華民國政府與美利堅合衆國，經一方面之請求，或現在抵抗敵國之戰事停止後，至遲六個月內進行談判，簽訂一現代廣泛之友好通商航海設領條約，此項條約，將以近代國際程序與中華民國政府及美利堅合衆國政府近來與他國政府所締結之近代條約中所表現之國際合法原則，與國際慣例爲根據」。惟是該項通商條約，雖已訂定，但關於收回租界後之權利義務，市政府尙未訂有具體辦法，則是本案仍難澈底解決，現市府方面，正向谷方搜尋此項資料，加以縝密研究。據一般觀察，一旦外商公司事業通過照納營業稅後，公司方面突然增加一筆負擔，其解救之道，難免漲價一途。</p>
<h3>經濟改革方案　商會請實施</h3>
<p>市商會頃電政府，要求從速實施經濟改革方案，並健全經濟政策督導機構，改組全國經濟委員會，延致工商團體代表，參加組織，以溝通意見，充實力量，而共同挽救當前之經濟危機。</p>

<h3>旣非舞女亦非法官　少婦芬白被控否認　盛裝到案　抱孩餵乳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕少婦祝黃芬白被控冒充女推事，妨害秩序一案，昨由地檢處方正檢察官首度傳祝偵訊。祝容顏娟秀，裝束入時，着銀灰色底紅花綢旗袍·白鹿皮高跟皮鞋，懷抱嬰孩，不時解衣餵乳。據渠供稱：住金陸中路吉祥里二八二號，夫名祝懷丕，經營商業，叔父黃炎，前曾在偽特區地院任首席檢察官，上月廿八日渠應友人之邀，晚九時許獨自在維納斯舞廳品茗，被舞客周家華施家平等疑爲縣女，發生衝突，將周施等扭送警局。矢口否認曾冒充推事情事。庭上對於祝是否有冒充公務員，假名招搖撞騙，或包攬詞訟情事，以尙須調查，論知交保，改期再訊。</p>
<h3>變賣台灣巨金案黃在義神通廣大　兩度漏網化名匿日本　其兄黃在榮返滬被擒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕因美軍中校艾文思呑沒台灣福字金幣三十公斤（價値美金十萬元）而牽涉之台灣人黃在義（見圖），經美國，上海，台灣，東京等地司法警務機關，四出偵尋，已成目前國際間之一謎。　此事經過，遠在剛勝利時。我國當局接收台灣，曾委託美駐台通絡官艾文思中校，代爲接收，歷年日人在台灣民間所搜括之黃金，金幣及金飾等，約重六十公斤。事後艾文思交與我國者，僅三十公斤，而此金幣三十公斤，則不知下洛。當時，我政府曾接獲情報，知艾文思將此金幣，自台空遝上海後，即托黃在義在上海市塲內全數出售。嗣後，經我當局嚴密偵查後，自各方收買者手中陸續追回大部。</p>
<p>嗣美政府經我國將經過情形通知後，遂於五月杪在洛杉磯將艾逮捕，開始偵查，並曾向本市司法當局請傳證人飛美應訊。六月六日在加利福尼亞州法庭正式起訴。　此案證人中，最重要者首推黃在義。本市地檢處曾於三月十五日一度傳訊，訊後由黃友人富華貿易公司經理程華楨保釋。後國防部接獲美國法庭之通知，要求傳訊黃在義赴美作證轉知本市當局，詎黃此時業已失踪。當時即向程華楨追素，程因此一度被扣，日前始准交五千萬書面保出外，限十五天內交出原人。</p>
<p>當地檢處偵查之際，同時曾通知台灣東京等地調查黃之行踪。迄至最近。尙無端倪。</p>
<p>本報記者以事出離奇，故單獨四出探詢黃之下落，據調查所得：黃於交保釋出後，即返南京西路九四一號寓所，拚檔一切，與其眷屬悄然離滬，搭輪返台。此後復曾易姓化名，與其兄黃在榮經營大規模之走私，以小船駁運物資，往返於台日之間，因事機不密，在日一度被捕，然終以神通廣大，旋被脫兎。在日釋出後，其兄黃在榮復又返滬，淞滬警備部當時風聞此事，即將黃在榮逮捕，刻仍在　押中。</p>
<p>至黃在義則據悉已再度化名，潛居日本，行動秘密，東京美軍當局至今尙在搜索中。</p>
<p>海黔輪由日抵滬我僑胞下輪時情形（本報攝）</p>
<h3>舞女切膚之痛　離婚未斷禍根</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大滬舞廳舞女金麗娜（原名杜菊英·見圖）年二十四，常州人，　舞歷有年所，今春三月間識一舞客名陸事芳者，年三十一，日久生情，過往頗密，後乃參加寗波同鄕會集團結婚，正式同居於龍宮飯店。</p>
<p>婚後，陸無正當職業，嗜賭，境遇復不佳。不久，陸續將女之私蓄，金飾錢鈔騙去化用殆盡，女以遇人不淑，竊　命薄而已。如是經過一相當時期，女以處境益形困難，協議離婚，終於六月廿七日由律師沈漢章正式辦理手續，當塲一次貼給男方四百三十萬元，言明斷絕關係。</p>
<p>仳離後，女以生活無依，重入大滬，再度下海，迄今已三月有餘。詎前夜陸亭芳忽往召女坐檯子，散塲後堅邀同出進食，女不能却，當同行街頭之際，陸又改變初衷，欲邀其至八仙橋，女不尤，測知陸此來必不懷好意，平存戒備之心。如是行行復行行，已至金陵中路，迨至久安坊前，女乘其不備，返身飛躍而入中央林記公寓，直奔樓上三〇三號，蓋此處爲其寄娘周陸氏所寄寓處也。陸睹女逃避入內，亦緊追而上，至房門口時，女已先一步將門反扣。不意陸心猶不甘，竟猛力破門而入，更自長衫袋中，掏出事前懷藏之鏹水一瓶，時周陸氏知生事變，但以爲當時陸所持者或爲刀槍凶器，故急上前搶奪，兩人略一糾縹，瓶塞鬆落，水遂汨汨而出，陸本人首先被濺及。因鏹水性烈，着物即冒白烟，周陸氏一時不知何物，意爲起火，遂在奔而出，大呼救火，一時隣居咸集，情形陷入混亂。時房內金女，逃避不及，急中生智，即將床上被褥，蒙蓋頭上，陸不肯放鬆，猶圖澆潑，幾經掙扎，致女頸部手部亦略受灼傷。至此，陸如癡如在，奪門而出，手持之鏹水瓶，猶到處亂洒，致將擁集門口之房客多人，均遭濺及。陸此際心慌意亂，不愼跌倒地下，因而鏹水盡傾其身，受有重傷。惟陸當時掙扎起身後，復在奔樓下，猶岡逃遁，但終爲房客多人合力擒住。經報吿嵩山警分局後，因其傷勢嚴重，先送警察醫院救治。而金麗娜至南洋醫院經包紮後，旋即出院。</p>
<p>此次慘劇之演變，雖傷人甚多，但幸無大碍，惟一不幸因灼傷而喪生者，僅樓上小貓一頭耳。</p>
<h3>楊詹等辯解三點　理由書逐點駁斥</h3>
<p>據被吿等所特爲辯解之理由，不外「（一）央行此種當日不能交換，以票據抵款者，非始於本年二月八日，以往有先例可援。（二）二月八日係星期六，央行前總裁貝祖詒在上午十一時三刻，始命令暗售，暗售時間雖過十二時　，但在央行未喫飯前仍應視爲上午，不受下午成交次日交割之限制。（三）央行十日奉令對於金業停止配金，被吿等不能於八日知悉」三點辯解。本院查央行所收票據，當日不能交換，以票據抵款情形，固非始於本年二月八日，然其以往之不法，業經前開財政部等之報吿書內闡明，惟數字不大，查係疏於注意，不及趕辦交換”尙難使免刑責。按二月八日暗售與同豐餘黃金，總數爲五百四十條，計售國幣二十九億五千三百三十五萬元，其中竟有二十五億零三百三十五萬元之票據不及交換，換言之，不啻同豐餘當日以四億五千萬元，購進價値二十九億零三百三十五萬元之黃金，以此龐大數字，不予過脹，謂非勾結圖利，其誰能信。此被吿等第一點辯解不足採信。</p>
<p>票據軋出應退黃金</p>
<p>至央行所謂下午成交，次日交割者，純係由於下午成交已過票據交換時間，而票據交換至下午二時停止，所有票據於下午一時半前送交換所，尙可交換，又造據被吿楊安仁證人王松濤供明，是其成交縱過中午十二時，亦非不能交換，且即如不能交換，所領之黃金，亦應退回，此觀本年一月十一日泰康潤領出黃金九十條，因繳款票據當日未能軋進，而退還黃金之事實，旣有黃金退回之先例，而同豐餘二十五億以上之黃金價款，竟以票據抵數，不退還黃金，是何厚於同豐餘，而薄於泰康。此被告等之第二點辯解不足採信。</p>
<p>避免停配倒塡日期</p>
<p>政府二月十日停配黃金之政策，固不能證明被吿等於二月八日即已得知，但同豐餘所付之票據，八日旣未轉賬，僅保存於出納科，而當時央行付金不憑傳票，又有上開證人王松　之證言可證，則在十日停配後，被吿詹蓮生使提出票據，兌取黃金，偽爲八日提出，以資彌補，非不可能。况央行買賣黃金，除明配及暗售中偶有一二當日交割淸楚外，其餘暗售，均有當日下午成交，隔日交割賬目，而二月八日之暗售獨無。此項賬目，查二月八日暗售成交黃金，共計八百條，分廿一次成交，均在上午（即被吿所稱央行飯前）當時交割淸楚，下午無成交條數，事實已不可能。况暗售之次數，係適應市面之需要，黃金狂漲之二月八日上午，有廿一次之成交，易言之，即市面上有廿一次之需要，而是日下午竟無一次之成交，豈是日下午市面竟無一次之需要。是被吿謂是日全係上午成交理論，尤不可通。執此與同豐餘提出票據，已過交換時間一點，互相觀　　則　吿楊安仁配售被吿詹蓮生所代表之同豐餘二十五億零三百三十五萬元，未付金款之黃金，顯係二月八日下午成交，應於十日交割。因避免十日停配，不能交割，而倒塡交割日期，以資彌補，尤屬灼然。此被吿第三點之辯解之不足採信。</p>
<p>年逾花甲酌予減刑</p>
<p>綜上說明，被吿楊安仁對於主管黃金事務與被告詹蓮生勾結圖利，罪證明顯，應依法論科。被吿詹蓮生代表同豐餘接洽領金，雖非公務員而與公務員共犯，同公務員身份而成立之罪，依刑法第卅一條第一項懲治貪汚條例第一條第一項後段，應以共同正犯論。惟該被吿年逾花甲，因一念之差，而蹈法網犯罪情狀，非不可憫，酌予减輕共刑，並分別褫奪公權，以昭烱戒。至本年一月廿七日央行售與同鑒餘暗售黃金一千八百二十條，而同豐餘當日賬上僅八百廿條，其餘一千條入次日賬，其不敷之一千條，據被吿等辯稱，係下午成交，次日交割，轉入次日賬。經本院調閱央行日記賬，尙馬相符，附以說明。</p>
<p>犯罪行為與林無關</p>
<p>二·關於林鳳苞部份，按林鳳苞雖係央行業務局長，對於被吿楊安仁詹蓮生勾結舞弊，事前未能防範未然，固難辭失察之咎，此係應否受行政處分之問題，至犯罪事實，須依證據認定，買賣黃金事務，旣係被告楊安仁專司其責，而本年二月八日在票據交換停止後，出納科收回同豐餘票據，係奉楊安仁之命令辦理，又據證人王松濤陳明，足微此項犯罪行爲，與被吿林鳳苞無關。此外又無其他積極證據足以證明該被吿有共同勾串行爲，當難以該被吿担任局長而遠於論罪，依法應爲諭知無罪之判決。</p>
<p>據上論結，應依特種刑事訴訟條例第一條第一項，第二項前段，第三條第二項，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，第二百九十三條第一項，懲治食汚條例第一條第一項後段，第三條第六款，第十三條，刑法第二十八條，第卅一條第一項，第五十九條，第七十三條，第六十四條第二項，第六十五條第二項，第六十六條前段，第三十七條第二項，第三項判決如主文。</p>
<h3>海黔輪載僑胞由日抵滬　陳國海一席話大堪注意　日野心依然旺熾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國營招商局「海黔」輪，載歸留日僑胞陳國海，張予鄉等四十一人，於昨午十二時牛抵滬，泊於該局第二碼頭，渠等即自行搬行李下船，分別離去，有關僑務機關，並未派人前往照料。記者昨晚走訪陳國海於客寓，承談甚詳，誌其大要如次：「渠等此行返國僑胞約四百餘人，於本月六日駛離日本佐世保，九日抵台，登岸台胞約三百餘人，內有日籍眷屬十二人，其另一日籍眷屬，携有子女四人，亦已入我國籍，昨日隨夫抵滬。該十三日籍眷屬，於船離佐世保時，其親友均至碼頭送行，相與泣別」。</p>
<p>氣概依然·不可一世</p>
<p>「一般日本人均不承認爲中國戰敗，其氣概仍不可一世，智識份子希望美蘇早日開戰，俾得從中取利，下焉者則望麥帥將台灣，朝鮮「退回」日本，故日本無論男女，均儘量討好美人，視麥帥爲第二天皇。其次關於日本武裝，雖經解除，其消防隊及警察組織，則極嚴密。首相片山宣佈自七月一日起，各國在”僑民，均須登記，否則查出後處以六月之拘禁。目前日本物資雖至缺乏，因其統制嚴密，其物價絕無上海物價暴漲之現象。自本月一日起，實行個人配給制度，且爲避免發生黑市交易，全國酒飯菜館，一律予以封閉，我國在日僑胞，十分之二以此爲業，因善於經營，獲利甚厚，頗遭日人　視，因此乃多作歸國之計。</p>
<p>蠻橫態度·令人髮質</p>
<p>「渠等於離日前，接華僑總會通知，每人可帶行李三件，共計一百五十公斤，各人携購用品甚夥，船離佐世保時，全爲日本稅關扣留，損失殊鉅，置我勝利國國際地位於不顧，其蠻橫態度，尤令人髮指。」最後渠稱：在日僑胞，均望我國佔領軍早日赴日，華僑生活始能獲得保障。</p>

<h3>星島南征觀感（三）</h3>
<p>綜觀四塲比賽的結果，我們感覺到在技術上星島仍然是比當地球隊的水準高。星島此次蒞臨，最低限度給予足球界兩點敎訓，第一是敎練的必需，第二是前鋒射門技術的重要，當地不乏可造之材，所久缺的就是集體訓練和專責的敎練人材，此地的球會並不如香港的那麼認眞，它們對於所屬球隊，沒有指定練習的時間，所以對於負責指導的敎練，也不予重視，今後如能效法香港的球會，放多一點錢和時間來訓練球員，將來的成就，恐怕還不止此。星島此次南遊，所遺留的印象，卻是因人而異，一般熱心體育的人士，多以他們缺乏「新血」爲憾，像馮景祥。黎兆榮。許竟成等蜚聲球界却在十年以上，不論他們技術怎樣湛深，總覺年事已高，氣力衰退，這是必然的趨勢，要非人力所能挽回，不論就體育界的前途，抑或星島的光榮着想，他們都深切的盼望新人輩出，表現新的氣勢，尤其是這次星島要到英倫觀摩，更應該讓年靑的球員，多獲借鏡的機會，像這一次的行列，不無令人有「老殘遊記」的哀思。</p>
<p>星島在此間雖未能以嶄新的姿態，滿足球迷的慾望，但此次適逢富地足球界以舉動粗野迭受惡評之際，能得星島充分表現淸爽的球藝，發揮高尙的運動道德，這正是星島的光榮的收獲。關於這一點，此問中西各報，均已一再推頌，我認爲星島雖不克全勝凱旋，但已載譽而歸，這種收穫相信比勝利還要名貴，我們預祝星島在英倫加倍發揮這種精神，博取更商的令譽，用虔誠之心，熟習人家的技藝，好待歸來訓練年靑的後進。（中央社記者余敬豪）</p>
<h3>塲地生疏　杭空軍受挫　仁餘四五比三九得勝</h3>

<p>比賽於七時半開始，仁餘隊長陳渭源特獻旗客隊，由空軍隊長許維垣抉受。該隊上塲陣錢爲應學文·游健行·孫煥庭。袁世銑。及許君。仁餘由吳新運·姚文彝·徐仲己·孫鸚舉·陳渭源五將應戰。裁判員陳賓琳。宣鶴皋。仁餘上塲，即得六分，客隊暫停，游健行首先命中，文彝鵬舉，追隨於後，又成十比二。空軍廖學文一鳴驚人，連中兩球，仲己新運相繼投出，成十四比八。廖君又見得手，孫煥庭罰中，空軍追成十四比十一，漸入佳境。仁餘李肇和易出陳消源，梁永佳調出吳新述。混戰凡五分鐘，各無建樹，空軍路靖替孫煥庭，上半時十八比十三，仁餘佔優勢。</p>

<h3>張煥章等招待各界　報告發起聯營經過　並縷述聯營公司之特徵及優點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口聯營公司籌備委員張煥章，黃元信，葉序盤等十一人，昨日下午四時許，聯名在海關俱樂部招待本市各界名流及新聞記者。　備主任張煥章，即席致詞。渠首述國際貿易衰落之原因，與公司創立之動機。繼即縷述公司之組織原則，及其特徵。</p>
<p>（一）聯營公司之特黴，有下列各項：</p>
<p>（一）聯營公司應爲進出口同業打開僵局，共謀福利而組織之企業，絕非獨佔國際貿易之托拉斯。</p>
<p>（二）聯營公司應爲公開並兼顧其他各業福利之組織，絕不應具有排外性與排他性。在此前提之下，尤其對於中國工農菜之要求，首予滿足。如爲中國工業品及農產品之外銷，尋求出路，爲建設與持續生產所需之機器原料等，增多進口供應，並以進口物資號召，吸收僑匯與國外存款。</p>
<p>（三）聯營公司應協助政府經濟政策之推行充裕國庫稅收，尤須擁護戰後經濟建設政策，培養國民經濟之基礎，絕非於國策之外另關蹊徑。</p>
<p>（四）聯營公司本協助進出口同業之旨，採相互委託聯營制，使與公司發生商業關係同業中之經營出口者，由公司負祖國際市塲價格變動之風險。在將其所得外匯結與　營公司之前提下，不可能之出口，成爲可能，幷獲得合理之利潤。經營進口者，亦可受公司之委託，經營輸入貿易，不使遭受國內市塲價格升降威脅，使易於進“，幷獲得合法之盈餘。</p>
<p>（二）聯營公司之優點如左：</p>
<p>（一）進出口貿易，在聯營公司通盤計劃下，可作適度之調節。公司所得外匯，雖得由公司運用，然仍開設專戶，存放中央銀行，受其監督，使外匯黑市，無法產生。資本逃亡，亦不可能。</p>
<p>（二）工業原料及生產器材，由聯營公司酌實際需要，統籌統訂，可以减少廠商原料進口價，促進增產，繁榮工農企業。</p>
<p>（三）國貨廠商製成品，可由聯營公司開拓國外市塲，盡量推銷於國外，換購所需原料，以資增加其生產能力。</p>
<p>（四）僑匯及國外在款，可由聯營公司以進口物資號召，予以吸收，免致逃避。</p>
<p>（五）聯營公司旣以其自身所得之出口外匯，經營進口業務，如能充分號展，則不僅不必仰求政府，供給外匯，反可山公司提出一部份外匯，貢獻政府。</p>
<p>（六）聯營公司業務發達，輸出入貿易繁榮，不特國際收支可漸趨平稀，而稅收激增，府庫充裕，國家預算亦可藉以平衡。</p>

<p>華股昨逢週六，人心得銀根鬆濫之助力，倍見興奮。證券帮各少壯份子，活動甚力，二三號八九號向永紗進取，一五二號讀納信和，一五七號則力襲美亞，三者生氣勃勃，景福新光追隨於後，亦步亦趨，五和織造，力爭上游，市價業已超越景福。業外游資未見參加，俏後略轉恍惚，漲停者有即交永紗及火柴兩種，趨勢業已轉堅。　晨初開出，即因隔前交換時國行差出頗巨，人心大振而見昻，尤以現景福開高最多。遞永紗開後二三一號一四八號一五二號一一六號二二四號均進，一四二號一六三號一四九號九四號則出，一七〇號等並拋現永紗，自一一一三〇元低至一〇九八〇元。信和遞交由六五號二一八號一八一號來進，一八五號一〇二號則出，高後亦有回跌，一五四號一一六號二〇七號一二九號一一九號二〇六號二二四號一八三號六九號均進，九九號四五號五六號納現永紗，而回升至遞永紗一一四〇〇元，現永紗一一〇五〇元左右，九一號一〇二號賣小至一一三〇〇元，一四號八九號一六三號一二六號一五七號來進，六九號並進現永紗，十時正，遞永紗升至一一五〇〇元。一〇二號一八〇號三六號一八六號二二號二三五號一五七號趁高了結，退至一一三七〇元。但遞信和經一〇四號之力吸，後漲到四七〇〇元外，人心尙俏，二三一號八九號三五號九九號再進，二三一號八九號尙進現永紗，於是即交永紗首先漲達限度，遞永紗亦步漲到一一六三〇元新高價矣。一〇五號一五四號八號一二號一〇四號一入〇號次第了結，一四七號二〇二號脫手現永紗，火柴雖由一五七號掛高至漲停板，遞永紗仍回跌至一一三五〇元。一〇四號八九號一七七號一四九號一一六號五四號趁低尙進，午收回升至一一五四〇元。收後五四號八九號尙納，農後喊價升至一一五七〇元左右，結果較前收計永紗漲停後有回，漲起一成不到，信和新光升半成，美亞永公漲一成，中法動興新華華豐微漲，火柴漲達限度，景綸跌半成，統益商務五和麗安水泥新亞各漲半成，餘股均吿微升。遞交計永紗信和美亞永公各漲一成弱，新光升半成，景福微升，華豐勤興微降。</p>
<h3>統債外股回漲</h3>

<p>外股昨稍回振，業廣鋼業繁植所升居多，餘股不過平穩而已。怡紗自七八〇〇〇元開後，升至八一五〇〇元而後稍平，證券帮先進後出，銀行帮及金號業雖出，洋商及廣帮有納。結果與前收相較，計紙業尙平，怡紗英聯會德豐怡啤航業微踏，業廣墾植鋼業各漲半成。</p>
<h3>紗花齊漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以銀根鬆弛，長江帮對二十支紗進胃更健，貨主居奇，市氣上騰。結果二十支特雙馬價高至二十三百萬元，雙馬紗亦漲至一千二百萬，比上日均步漲五十萬元。四二支藍鳳水月等細紗，竟冲出二千萬關外，爲二千零五六十萬元，比上日回騰七八十萬元。其餘卅二支廿支十六支及十支等粗細紗，一致軋升三五十萬至八九十萬。</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况交易甚旺，塲內以棉紗再起漲風，人心一致緊俏。惟以存底不多，到貨又少，故價格又較上日挺升。近來產地花價未見回小，販商無利可　，大都停辦。故在新棉未登塲前·來源旣不暢達，市價亦難面小，趨勢總在盤高局面。各檔做開送廠價計靈實二二〇萬，二二二于萬至二二五萬，漢細二〇七萬。又　交價計　實二一一萬，二一五萬，二一六萬至二二二萬。沙市二〇六萬至二一〇萬，漢細二〇〇萬至二〇七萬，彰德一九二萬，通州一七四萬至二〇一萬，冲沙市二〇五萬，火機一七二萬至一七九萬，靈實次貨一四〇萬。以上谷檔成交約一千餘件。又喊價而尙未成交者，計7/8米特林喊二三〇萬，靈實二二〇萬，南太一八五萬，火機一八〇萬。</p>
<h3>棉布明堅暗疲</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况呈明升暗降之局藍因廣東布價與滬市倒懸，辦胃呆頓，漢口市面與滬地相彷，故客路絕少去化，更兼龍頭細布塲內禁故，了結甚多，市上籌碼充沛，故結果藍鷄彩球陽鶴等細布，比上日回挫二千至四五千元。高檔土林及藍布元布漂布姊市仍穩固，紡建供售五福細布價爲四十二萬元，跳鯉農嘰四十五萬五千元，亦穩中帶軟之勢。</p>

<h3>恢復中日貿易　應當爭取出口</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕我國駐日代表團商務專門委員唐菊生氏，最近返國公幹。昨對記者談稱：日本全國上下現均束緊袴帶，以期恢復其戰前之貿易地位。日本人民中非無不能度其舒適之生活者，惟彼等寗刻苦自勵，犧牲小我，「饑餓出口」，決非宣傳，確係事實之表現。吾人對此，亟宜警惕猛省。渠繼指出對恢復中日貿易，國人所應注意者二點：（一）若干商人希望輸入廉價日貨，得取厚利。此項觀念，純屬錯誤，應知對日貿易，係以美元爲單位，輸入徒損外匯，且日本至今殊尠質地優良之貨物可購，故對日貿易吾人應着重爭取出口。若干日方所需要之出口貨，吾人迄未注意，如藥材是。至我國貿易政策，向不健全，希望政府從速改善，藉使出口商人獲得協助。（二）恢復通商之初，貿易數額不至過大，此時若任豪商插足壟斷，正當商人勢無經營之餘地。且「禁止輸入物品」之進口，將使正當商品之輸入爲之減少。渠表示代表團對恢復中日貿易，已作準備，不久並將設置商務官。至於日本與國外匯兌問題，屆時亦將獲得解決。渠又謂日本國內原料殊無缺乏，尤以煤鐵食糧爲甚，其工業尙未同復戰前水準，然貿易恢復後，工業之復興，即可加速進展。</p>

<h3>台北仲夏</h3>
<p>— 十日台北航訊　本報特派員　江暮雲</p>
<p>台北現在已入仲夏，白天火傘高張，人們都沿着享仔脚下走，慢條斯理的，準熱帶民族的性格。下午三四時，海面飄來一朶黑雲，隆隆的雷鳴，接着是一陣雨，台灣的風雨甚至雷聲，都是可怕的。但入晚却又顯得凉爽。天時和民族性，是個挺好的對照。馬路</p>
<p>馬路</p>
<p>上儘多是複販，翼軍服的，洋布的，雜貨的，香煙的，珊瑚的。警察們走過時，還是照常，二二八事件使治安當局對小本經紀者具有了戒心。但最應時的是冰攤，用各種不同的聲音，色調，方式向過路客兜生意，當局還沒考慮到有無妨礙衛生，要否取締。十日</p>
<p>十日</p>
<p>起，各機關雙恢復下午辦公制。這十天來，公務員最苦悶的是如何打發一個漫長的下午？台北畢竟可以消磨時間的地方太少了。奇蹟</p>
<p>奇跡</p>
<p>，出現在台灣。　台北和上海一樣，鬧着嚴重的房荒。佔的佔了，住的住了，在鬧市找一個舖面，可太不容易，在冷靜的郊區找一間破屋，委實困難。結果類乎條子的「權利金」大流行，二百五百萬儘喊，花樣時時翻新。</p>
<p>管理全省龐大日產的日產會，自己的房屋現在成了問題，屋主公路局要請他們搬四層「擱樓」上去住，這還沒解決。旅社</p>
<p>旅社</p>
<p>裏擁擠滿了上海生意人。什之八九是做枕木買賣的，他們明知沒大希望，總得千方百計的走門路，旅社房金每位自。百漲至五百元，不招待，也得討小賬，雖感太貴，但仍得挨下去。　枕木官價每枝五百五十元，交部規定法幣八萬餘元，比下來，還是有利可圖。只要想法到「派司」，獲得林管局的「期貨」。台灣有四大林塲，但鐵路委會要請求八十萬根，到現在連影子都沒有。火車在　枕木上滾，搖搖欲壓，各綫的管理人拍電報吿急，他們說出了岔子，工作人員不能負責。</p>
<p>但枕木仍能源源不斷地出港。過去</p>
<p>過去</p>
<p>的林務局，出了大亂子，這窟窿現在由新的林產管理局來塡補。　在德國研究林業的專家黃維炎現在下了獄，據說他是犯有濫伐和濫賣林木的嫌疑。過去深山積水，流注入海，需時三日，現在則縮短到三小時，林木的沒有保護和種植，苦了貧地的田家。先前日本人養鷄吃蛋，現在是養鷄吃鷄，直截了當。</p>
<p>有一個專員淸查前林務局業務的淸查團，由省府各關係機關，法院等七人準備在三週內做個總淸算。新局長唐扳緒則提出了六個方案，來治療舊病，免予復發。將官價關整到和黑市保持平衡，以及分配方法的再考慮，是主題之一。發電</p>
<p>發電</p>
<p>四十五萬Ｋ.W的大會水電發電總處派員勘測後，從速修復之議，又復活起來。但已完成百分之七十的土木工程，一年來頻遭破壞，旣成的積材，公開偷運，無法防遏。</p>
<p>這情形和緝私一樣，緝擭的大宗走私貨，不是空箱，就是劣貨</p>
<p>走私是絕大的冒險，台灣海面却是這批冒險家的樂屆。</p>
<p>但當局一再表明防止走私，是有決心和信心的。臨時</p>
<p>臨時</p>
<p>輸管委會的進口商登記，意外的本省申請者達八百餘家。商人們都在鵠候着，得能早日調查好，決定它能否經營進口貨的命運。可是看情形，還需要二三月。擄就，能邀批准的約八十家。特產</p>
<p>特產</p>
<p>：糖，草蓆，香蕉，西瓜，一提起就令人感嘆：產地價格，遠超過上海。　配給食糖，已聽見了足音，規定每斤台秈一百元，合法幣六千五，最普通的草蓆要七八千，香蕉因爲東京盟軍派專員檢查，需要量大增一支計台幣十元，西瓜則因爲一月餘的　雨在市而上久違了。</p>
<p>特產，在特產地就沒法享受特產品。</p>
<h3>西子苦熱</h3>
<p>— 杭州六日訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>七月開始以來，西子湖捲起了强烈的熱浪。太陽在早上六點鐘就外起來了，照到每一個尙在熟睡的人們，他們感着火辣般的不得不由床上起來，於是「熱」施着他的威風，每一個人匿居在屋的陰暗的角落，不停的揮着扇，汗還是無休止的淌着。他們只要門前有一顆樹，甚至是一顆小樹，也都認爲是逃避酷暑的勝地。所以馬路上除了有必要事情而定的人外，很少有人開散了，街是這樣冷淸淸的，僅是可以聽到一兩聲呌賣「貨金瓜」的聲音。中午以後，天氣更是熱得厲害，太陽眞像一柄火傘，路上都是沸熱的，柏油馬路雖然洒水車不斷的洒着水，但是柏油快要熔化了。</p>
<p>華氏寒署表，從早上八十八度昇起，看水銀逐漸的爬上去，九十度，九十二度，九三度……一直到九十六度，以後每一天的熱度有增無已。他已創造了九十八度的紀錄。</p>
<p>少婦風情</p>
<p>西子湖，在這熱浪的澎湃下，她已變爲三十以上少婦底風姿。那湖上樹木的葉子更形繁密而濃深，像是她披拂着的靑絲，從淸晨到傍晚，一眼就可以瞭見整個的湖面，不再半慚半羞的爲輕輕的簿霧所掩蔽。此刻，她並不是半推半就的溫柔，而是盡情而又熾烈的熱愛。雖然她美麗如昔，但是她濃　着脂粉，顯得蒼勁而有力。</p>
<p>西子湖，她確像是少婦的風情了。</p>
<p>晨問，如果駕一葉小舟，去到那荷葉深處，呌醒這朦朧中的荷叢，荷，才輕舒玉臂，吐出了芬芳，將疑這是在神仙的世界。或是駕船去到三潭印月，看小瀘洲上盛開的荷，像置身在香的水國中，將忘卻了庸俗的一切，從此，可以由清晨到深晩，留在這塊包圍荷花的堤上，讓湖上吹來的風，滌去胸中的辱暑。如是驅車去九溪，或是在龍井避去這熱浪，或是索興登烟霞洞，在那裏度過這炎夏。西子湖，誰敢說不是避暑的勝地？但是很多很各的人他們爲了自己的生活在奔忙，沒有這樣的閒情可以領略這大自然的賜予，於是他們只有在比較陰暗的角落裏依然工作着。</p>
<p>客店談月</p>
<p>冷飲店林立，走不上二十步就有一處，時賣捧冰的孩子們，揹着木箱，在盛暑下直着喉嚨喊着跑着。一些攤販，全家都在馬路的旁邊，大大小小整天在馬路上生活，他們已成立了兩路天的家庭。黃包車夫，揹負着重負，脚與滾燙的地拚着奔跑。這等等，也是與自然爭鬥的畫幅。另有許多為着大選而奔忙的人，他們先光後後的來杭州，也是不顧盛暑，不畏熱浪，在盛暑興熱浪下競賽着。</p>
<p>年年西子湖濱的夏，旅館總是到了淡月的時期，今年旅館的生意依然好，而且也漲了價，最上等旅館最上等的房間要十一萬五千元一天，而不畏盛署到杭州米玩的人到今未斷。有許多知名的人也正還在玩着呢！</p>
<p>湖濱紅燈</p>
<p>當夜幕拉起，太陽落山的時候，冷淸淸的街衢已顯出了熱鬧，所有逃避火傘的人都跑出了屋子，到那街道上來，每一條馬路，每一條街，爾旁都　滿了竹楊竹椅，靠椅之類，即是最繁盛新型的廷齡路也不能例外。很多人赤脚露臂躺在這機椅上面，揮　納凉，一直要到深晚二三時始搬回到屋裏去。</p>
<p>湖濱，更是熱鬧了，人推着人，人擠着人，賣永菓的，賣汽水水的，賣冷飲的都集中在湖濱的六個公園，第六公回裏到處是人，那草地上，坐着躺着的人眞多，第六公園的湖濱茶室更是擁擠不堪了。後去喝茶的人都要站在旁邊候補着。划子的生意，就在這個時候好起來，很多人都要下湖去，一個鐘點要一萬元，甚至有討價至一萬五千元的。有些人，帶着汽水水菓之類，又帶着音樂樂器之類，屜划子到湖心，就弄起器樂或是唱着歌曲，到是非常愉快的。</p>
<p>還有許多專門唱小調的姑娘，她們在湖中央的船上，當你的船划近去的時候，就有人向你兜唱，唱一隻，大概要五千元，甚至要一萬元的。</p>
<p>今年划子上都有一蓋紅燈籠，點點紅星佈滿在暗的夜晚。由湖心向湖濱瞭望，又是紅紅綠綠的霓虹燈，點綴得眩耀奪目，那露天電影塲，夜花園等都爭奇鬥妍的裝扮着。</p>
<h3>最經濟的空氣發動機　（下）</h3>
<p>— 程義坤</p>
<p>運用四汽缸活塞共四只</p>
<p>以前熱汽發動機上，都有兩個活塞，裝在同一汽缸內。事實上，一個產生動力，其他一個用來再生熱力。飛利浦經好多次的研究，發明了一四汽缸的空氣機，共用四隻活塞達成了一汽缸一活塞的目的。這種發明非但在製浩時可以省去許多材料和工程，同時使全機効力增高了許多。</p>
<p>上面已說過，老式熱氣發動機最大的缺點是：體積太大，重量太重，効率太底即以一千九百二十三年份，世界某大著名發動機製造廠所印的發動機程式說明書來看。我們知道，那年份所認爲最新式的熱氣發動機；它的全機得一千五百磅，體積約二十五立方公尺，所發原動力僅二匹馬力現在二匹馬力的飛利浦空氣機全重僅卅磅（比以前僅五十分之一）大小僅十分之二立方公尺（比以前僅一百廿五分之一）而效率則比以前高出二倍。如以飛利浦空氣機與同樣大小和重量的內燃機相比較，則其所發原動力和效率亦相差甚近。</p>
<p>極大的優點　燃料不固定</p>
<p>任何發動機，最大的消耗是燃料。依經濟原理而言，內燃機比蒸氣機經濟，內燃機中，則以柴汽機比汽油機經濟。飛利浦空氣機界乎柴油機與汽汕機之間。不過飛利浦空氣機在燃料方面，有一極大的優點，它不一定要用一種固定的燃料來發動它。柴油機一定要用柴油，汽油機一定要用汽油。飛利浦空氣機非但可以用柴油或汽油，即火油，植物油，酒精，煤氣，天然煤氣，木炭氣等一切可以燒熱空氣的燃料都可隨時換用。油料供給困難的地方，如我國內地，飛利浦空氣機最爲合用，長爲理想。</p>
<p>在經久耐用的方而來看，柴油機，汽油機和其他一切內燃機都沒有蒸汽機耐用。內燃機最容易損壞的地方是它的汽缸和活塞。這是因為油料和空氣混合後的燃料，經常在汽缸內爆炸燃燒，而事實上全部燒光絕不可能，一部份的熱油和熱氣，在被排出之前，就和汽缸和活塞本身的鋼料發生化學作用，逐漸使之消溶損壞，飛利浦空氣機的汽缸和活塞，經常所接觸的，除濾清的熱空氣之外，並無他物，而且這熱空氣除在汽缸內壓緊臌漲之外，並不在氣缸內爆炸或燃燒，所以它決無發生化學作川而被消镕的可能。因此飛利浦空氣機比任何其他發動機都經久耐用。</p>
<p>內燃機有一很顯注的缺點：它排出的廢氣，旣多且臭，而且含有大量的二養化淡等毒氣，汚汕，和煤烟等質素。飛利浦空氣機非常淸潔衛生；它所需用的熱空氣是在汽缸外而燒熱的，燃料可以全部燒光，熱氣可以濾淸後再輸入汽缸，氣缸中排出的廢氣，除稍有熱氣外，決無毒氣或臭氣存生之可能。</p>
<p>飛利浦空氣機並不像內燃機上用定時循環爆炸以產生動力，所以它開動時，聲音很小，不像內燃機那樣鬧聲震天，一部汽車用的十五匹馬力飛利浦空氣機車開動時，它所發的聲音，即不用隔音設備，也不過和我們普通家用的縫衣機縫衣時所發的聲音一樣大小。</p>
<p>空氣機不用爆炸生力，它根本不用火星塞，分電器，綫圈，電綫等電氣設備，所以它決無因電路障阻而停車的弊病。</p>
<p>此外，空氣發動機還有個極大的優點——它在開得極慢的時候，依然可以產生極大的動力。汽車上用飛利浦空氣發動機時，變速齒輪箱中，非但可以省去齒輪，即此變速設備亦可全部廢除。這在汽車製造時可以省去許多工程材料和成本，在駕駛時更將便利非凡。</p>
<p>飛利浦實騐室，經常在研究各種原理，往往在研究某一問題的時候，因欲精益求精，就連帶研究出許多新理論，新方法，和新東西。最後所得的結果，往往出乎意料的成功：造出了許多本來想都沒右想到的新東西。空氣發動機在開始研究時，也不過是想利用熱氣機的原利，造一只比較經濟而輕便的發動機而已。其後經十餘年不斷的研究，計算，改良和試騐而完成了許多完全不同的新配件，新的裝法和新的材料，最後完成了本文所介紹的這一種最經濟的空氣發動機。現在這種飛利浦空氣機自十分之一匹馬力至數百匹馬力，各種大小，各種形式，已應有盡有，它們可以用在汽車，火車，工廠，家庭，和其他一切需要原動力的地方。歐美各國，現已大批定購採用，在不久的將來，它當能在我國各地風行，以助建設。因為它有許多特點，適合我國需要，尤其是它的燃料供應問題，和經濟耐用兩點，最合我國理想，希望將來因此而原動力的成本可以减低，各種工業科學，均得賴以飛速進展。本報因篇幅關係，未能將詳情備述，讀者如有關於這種空氣機的疑問，可投函上海郵政局第九百念五號信箱與本人直接通信，當盡個人見問所及，勉爲解答一切。</p>
<h3>新發動機　原理圖解</h3>
<p>〔第一圖〕熱力發動機圖解：</p>
<p>已經壓緊的空氣在汽缸Ｖw內再經加熱器ＩＩ加熱，膨脹，推動活塞ＺＷ而產生動力。由飛輪作川，活塞ＺＷ在產生動力之後，又被推入汽缸，它即將ＶＷ中已經川過，逐漸冷下去而依然相當熱的空氣，經熱力再生器的隔離板Ｒ，冷却器Ｋ，而推入熱力再生汽缸ＶＫ。這冷下去的空氣，被熱力再生器的活塞ＺＫ受飛輪作用在ＶＫ中高牙緊壓而再生熱力。這再生的熱力經Ｋ和Ｒ再輸入至汽缸ＶＷ中再行產生動力。</p>
<p>加熱器Ｈ是由鍋爐Ｂ燒熱的。冷卻器Ｋ則是用水冷或風冷法使其冷卻。這是因為動力汽缸中所推出的熱氣，如不經冷卻即再壓緊，它的熱度將太高而爆炸。所以必須冷卻後方可使兩汽缸中得一適當的熱度。</p>
<p>熱氣發動機上，它二個活塞桿Ｄ在Ｃ１，及Ｃ２處中心活動釘住。然後接至地軸Ｓ（即飛輪的兩邊）在此飛輪上，產生動力汽缸的活塞桿裝在再生熱力活塞桿前面的九十度處，所以動力活塞的轉動比熱力再生器活塞超前九十度。</p>
<p>〔第二圖〕Ｖ式熱氣機圖解：</p>
<p>此機原理和第一圖完全相同，不過它在飛輪上加了一個均勻轉動用的重量Ｇ。此機因用Ｖ式裝製，故比第一圖所示者省去幾件傳力設備的零件；全機地位亦略有縮小，飛輪轉動均勻，所以震動亦減小了。</p>
<p>〔第三圖〕飛利浦四汽缸空氣發動機圖解：</p>
<p>此機每一汽缸頂上有一熱氣地位ＶＷ，同一汽缸的而就是冷氣地位ＶＫ。第一汽缸的熱氣部份ＶＷ利第二汽缸的冷氣部份ＶＫ相連，其中即裝加熱器Ｈ，再生熱力器Ｒ，冷卻器Ｋ。其他各汽缸亦以同樣方法裝置。各活塞接在同一　地軸上，第一活寒。至第四活塞Ｚ４各差九十度裝接着，所以第一活塞永遠第二活塞先動九十度，如此至第四活塞，成一三百六十度全圈轉動。</p>
<p>〔第四圖〕最老熱氣機圖解：</p>
<p>此機僅活塞Ｚ產生動力生，Ｐ是一冷熱氣交換活塞。Ｒ是爐子，它把ＶＷ中的冷氣燒熱，熱氣經Ｐ而傳至ＶＫ，同時以Ｒ壓緊之，使其膨漲而推動活塞Ｚ，用過後的冷氣，再經ＶＫ及Ｐ而回至ＶＷ，再由Ｂ燃熱，如此循環不息，產生動力。</p>
<p>〔第五圖〕依第四圖原理而製造的第一部熱氣機：圖右高大的汽缸，分成上下　部：下面是鍋爐（即第匹岡的Ｂ），上面是冷熱氣交換器（即第四圖的ＶＷ，Ｐ和Ｐ上面的ＶＫ部份）。圖中的小氣缸，內裝活塞（即第四圖的Ｚ和它下面ＶＫ）。圖左是飛輪。其他轉力設備在岡上可以看出。</p>

<h3>江載曦之畫</h3>
<p>— 玄暢</p>
<p>近世藝苑，作者輩出，藻采紛披，競相扇發。其間年少英多，沉潛於藝事，而勇猛精進者，以余所知，江子載曦其一也。載曦一字見　，，十年前卒業於蘇州藝專，稱高第弟子；爾時所作，已驚其長老。自日寇犯順，蜷伏海上，益肆意於六法。時蘇州藝專亦來遷於滬，君被聘為敎授，校藝燈窗，敲學相長。出則從諸勝流遊，切則不倦，藝乃大進。君之於畫，初以宋元人為法，寢　日久，盡悟其要；所作往往於工細中見渾穆之致。下逮明淸諸家，靡不心追而手撫之，可謂能博綜矣。是以於山水花鳥人物走歡，涉藝所至，咸有家數。比歲以來，愛寫蛺蝶，花間栩栩，神態欲仙；一時有江蝴蝶之目。余謂書畫不必泥古，然不可不自古人出；箏端在在有古人，斯着　處處有自己。所謂天分學歷，相濟而成！載曦可謂能得之矣。</p>
<p>載曦為余鄕里土，淵雅有才氣，書宗章艸，近日方以其平日所積得意之作，展覽於大新畫廳，用書吾說以張之。</p>
<h3>贈江載曦</h3>

<p>得徐皇神，後起才也。承貺一　，活禽生卉，淸</p>
<p>風在　，今江君方展其近作，賦此贈之。</p>
<p>後來應喜能居上，玄陽樓頭又見君，待挹濟風珍一扇，活禽生卉滿南雲！</p>
<h3>知覺的寫實性的繪畫</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>現代巴黎畫派中探求視覺的寫實的趨勢，前些時筆者已有所陳述了，這里我們再把其相對的，所謂重視「知覺」（Connaisan-ce）的傾向叙說一下。　　現代的藝術，一般說來，雖都具有重視「理性」（Intelligcnce）畫上却可看到想把知覺所感受的眞實性繪畫的加以表現的趨勢。我們指出現於巴黎　派的這種傾向，稱之為「知覺的寫實性」（R.ealite　de　Connaisance）</p>
<p>繪畫上的所謂知覺或理性，都是指一種感受性的形態而言、決不是所謂知覺或理性的概念。換句話講：繪畫上的知覺、是將感受性的中心認為理智的中心的塲合，或是那感受性具有知覺的方向的塲合所研討對象。這種傾向，不但是現代，即在法蘭西繪畫的傳統中，亦有幾分這樣的傾向，這是不可否認的。假如細察古典主義的達維（J.L.D.avid）和安格爾（Ingres）等的作品，都可以找出相當知覺性的氣氛。這種傳統的潛在物，可說在現代的法蘭西繪畫，尤其是巴黎畫派中，顯現得頗為濃厚。至少探求理智的感受性，是最現代的特色之一。像現代繪畫的那樣要求理性或知覺的傾向，就是要求「感受性」（Sensibilite）的一種趨勢，這樣的趨勢，可說是繪畫史上空前未見的現象。</p>
<p>以我們觀看物象的形態為例；如果觀看那完全依照自然的形態，那末，這就是純粹的自然主義；設使我們以繪畫的方向來視它，而以視覺的眞實為中心，那末，不得不說它是視覺的寫實性了。反之，知覺的方向，例如無論綫，無論面，都使之脫離自然而隨從繪畫的機械主義，而維持這樣的現狀而構成繪畫的形態。又如感受到物證所具有的物質的東西，那也將表現其知覺的物的眞實性。可脫就是作為機械式的粗描而處理，或是作為特寫而處理的。這在色彩的塲合，亦可認為是同樣的。因此，如果極端的傾向於知覺的方向，那就無異成為一種符號的東西，或者具有一種象徵的力量起來。譬如立體主　，便　　　　的　　，而　　是極端地推行構圖底形成。自此所出的許多　家，畫派，就是　於這　知覺的。如舉個更極端的實例，那就是達達主義（Dadaisme）。</p>
<p>達達主義離然是繪畫上的無政府主義，但並非是無理性的懷疑或否定，可說是絕對理智和知覺的生辣的綻露。</p>
<p>這樣的傾向，還是立體主義顯示得最適當。立體主義的繪畫，可說業已充分的超越着視覺的偽視法和透視法。假若探求視覺的眞實，則所謂偽觀法或透視法成了問題。但是依據理性和知覺的塲合，欲加以擺脫，便不如何困難。所以像立體主義者們，嘗想在一個畫面上，把四次元的時間的間隔或物體、用重疊與並存方式表現出來。立體主義者所感受的，旣非繪　的視覺，亦非繪畫的情操。完全是繪畫上的知覺的遵重，知覺的感受性的極端的驅使。一</p>
<p>從這樣的傾向的繪畫成長的一切「巴黎畫派」的畫家們，都正在强調着這所謂知覺的感受性的。如超現實主義（Surrealisme）縱無達達主義所具有的懷疑性與否定性，但可說正在　使着知覺的感受性，甚至把它視作一種符號的東西，或一種象徵的東西。超現實主義在觀物的塲台，顯著的重視想象，但其實不僅是重視想象，而且想把那想象的次元加以知覺的變形。（也並不是如立體主義那樣的變形描法）所以它之所謂重視想象者，應該是和知覺的感受性相反的，然其實也並無何等關聯。所謂用想象力而使物的知覺發生變形者，不外乎推行着知覺的寫實而已。因此繪畫上的達達主義的精神以及超現實主義的精神，都可說是探求繪畫上的知覺的寫實性的趨向。</p>
<p>這種趨向，在現代的巴黎畫派，以立體主義為　礎。而作畫的一切畫家中，都可看到。不論是喬琪·白拉克（George　Braoue　1882），不論是祁里珂（Chirico　1883），葛羅曼耳（M.Gromaire）等都共通的具有這樣的趨向。這其間，我們還可以區別出兩個知覺的傾向：</p>
<p>（一）雖在探求知覺的眞實，但是寫實主義的，即應該稱之為寫一實的寫實主義的眞實（Realiterealis　tique　de　Connaisance）。例如上述的喬琪·白拉克，　羅曼耳，祁里珂等均　之。</p>
<p>（二）雖稱正在探求知覺的眞實，但是機械性的，是另具一種機械的傾向的，即應該稱之為知覺的機械的眞實（Realite　Mechanique　de　Connaisance）。這可舉出一般稱為純粹主義（Purisme）的傾向許多作家們。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血341</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這雙夫妻之外，還有一名小伕子，名呌劉五，是劉氏的堂侄；這時是一個體强力大的十八歲小夥子；在「〇四」手下，出名的刁蛋，識得幾個字，跟着「〇四」學收發電報和日語。無奈「〇四」自己的日語，相當不高明，並且大舌頭帶口吃，所以劉五的日語，不僅學不好，這不好裏面，還期期艾艾，把口吃學到了家。</p>
<p>我們這一行五人，用「十五號」姿態，從北平跟着日倭軍　專車，一帆國順到了昌平。在客棧裏，不用自己舉火，所以我自己在棧裏司理電訊，把杜二夫妻，「〇四」和劉五，都派到外面，打聽當地倭軍動態和前進路綫的情形。</p>
<p>剛把這德式兩用電機裝上，就跟北平，群接了話綫　君吿訴我，在我離開北平的半小時後，就收到耀羣和虎城兩天以前發出的幾分報吿。</p>
<p>虎城的報吿，據說也是由昌平發出。這次情報，確是他自己親筆，遞送的方式，却是生面別開；也不知是他獨出心裁，還是從什麽地方學來，弄得很有機密意味，他把一分報吿，攔腰截成兩叚，用兩名急足，每人一毀，送到Ｗ君總部裏。</p>
<p>這件報吿，總共一百多個字，Ｗ君費了一個多小時，才把大意看得明白，簡直比透譯複式密碼，還要困難。根據報吿。知道他與耀羣雖未見面，已經得到下落。又就東北寨子的人，不知何故沒照預定計劃，在張北聚會，反而跑到昌平來，給日鬼捕捉了幾名。</p>
<p>這報告書又說「小老虎預計在一兩天內，準定可以見到耀羣。」</p>
<p>關於躍羣的報吿，Ｗ君說共收到兩件；一件是電報，採用明碼隱語式，十分簡短，僅提到工作複雜，及虎臣誤　　語，致行動不相符合。另一件是明信片，也是隱語式，說明津地工作，無法結束，只能暫時放任，希望總部派人趕速料理。她本人為了趕赴指定地點，與部下聯絡，已經尅期動身了。</p>
<p>據Ｗ君的意見，耀羣所謂「津地工作」，大概不是專指增强秘密組織一項而言，也許還有其他臨時發生的事情。這一電一片，暗註的號碼，並不相連，大約中間還有兩三件報吿，沒有遞到，或是遺失了。另據Ｗ君的推想，認為耀羣目下遠遠遛在晶平一帶。</p>
<p>我同Ｗ君談話結束之後，又忙着發出兩件祕訊，（一）到潘陽，（二）到東京；都是探詢鶴見行踪，報吿我進行的所在地，並規定收發報吿時間和波長等項。</p>
<h3>大千于劍華</h3>
<p>— 非素</p>
<p>兪劍華與張大千，是二十年前老友，民國十六年冬，善子大千兄弟將所藏明淸書畫展覽於西門路大風堂中，劍華冒雪往觀，流通坐臥不忍去，遂與訂交。其時劍華執敎新華藝專，所居相去不遠，故時相過從，劍舉每飯於大千家。劍華性不嗜辣，而大千川人，每菜必辣，劍華閉目强呑，汗輒涔涔下。十七年春，大千兄弟發起，邀皇賓虹，陳剛叔，熊松泉，馬企周，蔡逸民，俞劍華等八人，會於松隱廬，組織爛漫社，以賓虹年高德劭，共推為社長，大千年最少，劍華則長大千二齡。爛漫社組織之初，本有種種計劃，曾刋印爛漫畫集一冊，其後以人事滄　，社務無法進行。二十年來，剛叔，企周，逸民，善子先後去世，今所存者僅得其半，賓虹以八十高齡，肥遞北平，松泉在滬，劍華新由閩歸，大千由教煌倦遊歸來，班荊道故，緬懷往事，恍如夢寐。</p>
<p>社中八人各有專長，賓虹山水出入宋元，獨具面目，剛叔花卉，淸勁秀麗，在白陽新羅之間，企周觸類皆擅，好寫北派山水；逸民畫竹，有湖洲之風。松泉喜　走獸，獅子最工；善子雖擅山水人物，而畫虎最為人所　灸，故當時「熊腳子」「張老虎」幾成二人別號。其時大千醉心石濤八大，至劍華本擅山水，不名一家。善子以三百年來，　半千獨無繼響，逢勸劍華致力於襲，而劍華以齊魯雄健豪爽之氣，習渾厚茂密之畫，一拍即合，不久即可亂眞，劍華鐫印曰「半千之半」，實讓詞也。</p>
<p>民二十一年夏，大千劍華相約東渡扶桑，縱覽富士箱根熱海之勝。劍華並舉行畫展於大阪，極得彼邦藝術界之好評。此後劍華以師古人不如師造化，乃遍遊東南名山大川，「搜盡奇峯打草稿」，歸而與古代名家作品相印證，益信所見不謬。大千當是其雁蕩生紀遊冊云：</p>
<p>「昔聞雁山勝，十年未得遊。籠湫南北　，每向夢中求，俞子發淸興，登山雙足遒，千峯撐眼底，一一筆端收。百回看不厭，憐予願始酬。若敎起二石，拍　　　　。　　云：　　　　雁蕩歸來，示我小冊數事，其　景奇峭，固由天造，而運筆之妙，則由　　石溪石　得來，　　俚句博笑。大千張爰。</p>
<p>近十年來，大千已飲　藝　，世有定評。劍華且遊且畫，　日廣，而　益　，且劍華曾習西　，故於寫生，尤能形神　肖，所寫黃山白岳，　阜武夷，天會雁　，曾遊其地者，一見即可推　。而運筆用　，布局設色，在在　古法相合，但又不落古人　　。旣無新派習氣，又無臨仿之弊，所謂「外師造化，中得心源」者，豈劍華之謂歟？今劍華將出其所作以供衆賞·大千適以事返蓉，不克躬與其盛，今述彼二人之關係，為觀　者作一　引耳。</p>
<h3>記「覺悟」茶會</h3>
<p>— 蘇鴻烈</p>
<p>懷着一份年靑人深具的熱情，駿上大街，已是赤日炎炎的時候了</p>
<p>說來也是深深地感覺到十分地抱撳的，自從民國日報「覺悟」社在去年由徐蔚南先生發起組織，正式成立以來，事實上我可以說一點也沒有盡過我應盡的力，並且也沒有寄給他們一份他們所期待着的稿子。可是由於主持人的愛護社友，最近在萬忙中又很忻喜地接到他們所發來的一份請柬。</p>
<p>拿着它，我懷着忐忑怔忡的心，按着地址，因為塘沽路並不十分長，香關路弄的「文藝小憇」也很容易找到。</p>
<p>席間靑年居多，有右　，茅苓，朱倩萍小姐等，都是以前經常在民國日報執筆寫稿的青年作者。</p>
<p>徐蔚南先生在席間並講述了很多關於「覺悟社」以後的期望，語多勗勉。席罷並有餘興筋目。</p>
<p>年靑人都想有一個有趣的生活，希望這一種組織，能永遠地發出它的光輝和熱力來，可使一羣愛好文藝的靑年，時時有一個碰面團聚的機會。</p>
<h3>竹莊先生邀觀黃山大觀圖</h3>
<p>— 宋大仁</p>
<p>黃山別自有天地，寫入丹靑縈各殊；不識箇中眞面目，雲松雖妙總糢糊。</p>
<p>劍華遊跡遍天下，四幅圖成蔚大觀；嚴　縱橫雲幻滅，圖屛詎概百回看。</p>
<p>文院天都造化奇，松峯列顯雄姿；如橡筆寫如仙境，未許尋常藝史知。</p>
<p>我正搜奇恣壯進，披圖先向此中求；無端似聽山靈笑，笑爾渾疑孕索邱。</p>
<h3>觀黃山大觀以老丹詩意有　未盡輒用原句續貂</h3>
<p>— 濤盫</p>
<p>曾到黃山脚，未登天都峯；今觀劍華靈，始信入化工。千　競秀麗，萬峯刺天空，劍戟森羅列，怪石蹲虎熊；崎嶇上鳥道，蟠旋掛虬松；畫家師造化，兪子今稱雄；兩足踏　岱，一手攀華嵩；名山　遊遍，腰健不用笻。歸來爭揮洒，下筆如有風；雲烟隨變幻，邱　生心胸；黃山兩百里，盡納一幅中；抉去黃王絆，直搗董巨宮；愧余筆墨劣，　汗追高　；觀圖三嘆息，戰鼓正　　。</p>
<p>不見劍華三十年，相逢海上　毛斑；佳兒頭角崢嶸　，畫筆　　意象　；聞道天台成獨往、何時龍洞共追　，淞　小築同杯酒，已覺詩懷到　川。</p>
<h3>「飛盤」的眞相</h3>
<p>— 海風</p>
<p>七月五日以來，據說　賽各地天空，發現一種快速度的「飛盤」·「飛盤」的式樣，大小·與飛行時形陸變化的情形，都不一致；一位　森夫人說：「飛盤」如圖形洗衣盆，有五間　　那龐大，由天空跌落以後，即無影蹤。一位大學生說：「飛盤」作　圖形，　　藍光。而一個飛行員却說：牠像一珠灰色蚌蛤　之飛機，其頭都有網狀之圖頂，直徑約十五尺，厚約四尺</p>
<p>而有一位　於做廣吿的　術家，竟致電杜督門總統。他說滿天飛舞的「飛盤」，只是　　衛器械之一種，不過因為一時失去控制，以至飛至各地。</p>
<p>據上所述，可以知道美國各地是為着這神秘的「飛盤」，已經鬧　「滿城風雨」了。</p>
<p>究竟「飛盤」是怎樣一種東西呢？</p>
<p>我們且舉出幾個科學家的話，來看看所謂有如「火箭」的「飛盤」，在科學的　隊上，　們正確的意見如何：</p>
<p>（一）會主持比基尼原子炸彈試驗之布蘭蒂海軍上將諸人，　不相信有「飛盤」一物。</p>
<p>（二）發明飛機之賴特，說得更露骨，他說：「此事僅係一屬宣傳，以支持國務院目前之運動，「欲使吾人捲入另一戰渦之中，使人民自相驚擾，以為外國對吾人有所行動。」』</p>
<p>（三）另一位雪梨大學物理敎授柯登博士，以視覺證明「飛盤」之不可靠。柯登命全體學生向地平綫全神凝視，其中有廿二個學生稱看見「飛整」，柯氏解釋此即光學的幻覺。</p>
<p>（四）權威科學家愛因斯坦，對此更表冷淡，他僅稱：「絕無意見發表。」</p>
<p>直到七月八日為止，軍事方面或科學界，對傳說紛紛的「飛盤」，都還沒有下過確實的定論，最多，也只能如李梅准將所稱，僅係一種最普通的「測候儀氣。」</p>
<p>為什麽美國人會鬧得「滿天星斗」呢？我們以為「飛盤」應該不是科學上的名詞，牠只是人民恐怕受到戰爭的威脅，以致在光學的幻覺上，在脆弱的心理狀態上，看見了這個新武器的幻象。</p>
<p>或者也正如去年十月瑞典上空傳說發現「火箭」，於是有人說那是由蘇聯控制下的渡羅的</p>
<p>現在全世界都很緊張，這種幻覺上的「飛盤」，也許足以說明人類正患着極沉重的神經衰</p>

<p>有一個鋼鐵鐵廠中的工人，有一次和其他的許多工人們爭論了，那些其他的許多工人們不僅在言論中戰勝了他，並且還把他丟進了小河中去。那工人在小河中爬出來的時候，混身是汚水和泥土。正在這時候，廠長走過，便問他，以後，他打算怎麽去對付那些其他的許多工人們，他回答着說：「和他們大家笑笑好了！」</p>
<p>費爾柏敎授也寫過這樣的話，「當人們在憎恨你的時候，不必憤怒和感到痛苦的。你不妨以為那是非常有趣的事；因為你自已誠實地盡你的力量辦由人了。」</p>
<p>林肯，前美國大總統，的確能如此做的，有一次，約翰派爾馬將軍尋　地來對林肯說：「假使隨便任何人告訴我，在這個危機存亡之秋，人民竟從一個默默無聞的起碼小鎭中，去選出了一個默默無聞的起碼律師來做大總統，我　直不相信。」這時，林肯坐在剃頭店的椅子中，他用堅強的手臂，把剃頭師父推開了，把椅子旋轉過來，用手拍拍將軍的膝頭說：「和你一樣，我也簡直不相信呢！」於是，約翰·派爾馬竟無由尋　了。</p>
<p>美國的內戰，南北戰爭的緊張，可以使林肯為了憂愁，為了刺激，而以致於死亡的。但是，林肯常常在睡前閱讀着笑話和幽默故事，並且常常在談吐中，把所心愛的笑話說出來，以調和白宮中緊張的氣氛。那赫赫有名的解放奴隸的宜言，在公佈那天的會議中，林肯還是用一只笑話開始演講的。</p>
<p>無疑的，假使你在行將破產的時候，或是你在遇到胃癌的絕症的時候，在這種悽慘的情形下，那是簡直一些也笑不出來的。並且，我也不是說，在每一次我們被人家丟在河中時，我們就每一次的笑笑而已，不過，有許多時候，往往我們是自招其咎，罪有應得的，那麼便不妨自己作，自己受了。</p>
<p>更有時候，我們常被人家為了嫉妒而憎恨你，或是人家在語言中故意的中傷你，——以及這一類的事，我們惟有一笑以置之！</p>
<p>紐約的名播音家甜姆斯，泰勒，時常收到幾千幾萬封人家稱讚的信，同時他也偶然收到幾封人家攻擊他的信。他因此而憤怒嗎？不，他以為那些信非常的有趣，並且還在電台中，把那些駡他的信讀出來。他特別喜歡一封</p>
<p>一個女人給他的信，駡他是「說讀者，是奸賊，是毒蛇，是笨木頭。」泰勒先生平靜地說：「那位女士也許是說着玩玩的，在和我打情駡倘呢。」幾天之後，泰勒先生將那封把他自己駡得體無完膚的信在數百萬聽衆前再公開的讀出來——因為他收到了那位女士的零外的一封信，說她的意見是始終絲毫不改，泰勒先生說：</p>
<p>「所以，我依舊是一個說讀者，一個奸賊，一條毒蛇，以及，唉，天曉得！我依舊是一根笨木頭！」於是，我們一面和泰勒先生一同大笑着，一面佩服他的鎭靜，處置得妙，和他的幽默感</p>
<p>在美國的所有總統中，很少很少有受到　故總統，佛蘭克林，羅斯福那樣的被人家嚴厲的攻擊過，但是，他在任的這許多年中，他委實可以說沒有厲聲大駡，或是憤怒過。我怎麽知道的？每一個和他在白宮中住得長久的人，都會告訴你，這是確實的。</p>
<p>羅斯福收到許多攻擊他的惡毒的信——那些簡直不堪一讀的信，那些信任何人讀了一定暴跳如雷的。常常那些信甚至於信封上，也塗着侮辱的字句或漫畫。當羅斯福總統收到了那些信，他祗不過笑笑而已。他保存了那些信封，歸併在一起，取了一個標題呌「香氣襲人」（Bouquetsand　Brickbats）（原文意為香氣和武器）當羅斯福總統故世後，那些信封和他那些著名的集郵，一同拍賣，說來也許你不相信，出乎意料之外，那五十二隻充滿着侮辱的信封，竟被高抬至美金五　念五元現鈔的高價拍賣出去了。啊，這是事實！</p>
<p>唉，世事如浮雲，有許多事，我們何苦讓自己煩惱呢，不妨一笑置之！</p>
<h3>說鼓中三老</h3>
<p>— 鼓手</p>
<p>北人好聽載，除聽戲外，可以滿足視總之娛的，要算雜要塲，雜要塲中，變載法等類·名目繁多，最主要的，要算大肢，大鼓也是名目繁多，最主要的有三　：就是翠弦八角鼓，梅花大鼓，京韵大鼓。俗語設得好，行行出狀元，這三種大鼓，出了三個狀元，就是榮劍　·金萬昌，劉寳全。咱們如今且先說說金萬昌，</p>
<p>金萬昌是唱梅花大戴的，按文言說，梅花大鼓的詞兒，多一半是呢呢兒女　，如寳玉樣病，黨玉焚稿，王二姐思夫，彷彿柳屯田的詞是要二八女郞，</p>
<p>有人說金萬昌嗓子好，本錢足，其實他的鼓技，才出神入化。無論何種排子，各項絲弦，經他的鼓點指揮，忽然如金戈鐵馬，忽然如幽咽流果，忽然如暴風急雨，忽然如柳暗花明，沒有一樣不抑揚如意，高下從心，我們外行人聽，只覺得變化無窮，內行更一致推崇，說是無人能及。再加嗓昔寬亮，能够把兒女情腸，徹底描摹，字字送入人的耳鼓，句句挑動人的心弦，難道還不算梅花大鼓的狀元嗎？</p>
<p>咱們再說說榮劍　，他唱的是單弦八角鼓，這一種大鼓，名呌子弟書，本是八旗中有學問的人編出來與二三好友，唱着玩兒的。尤其是各種盆曲，如風雨歸舟等類，也有言情的，也有寫縈的，也有諷刺社會的，五花八門，很像短篇筆記小說，詞藻極美，意味甚深，未唱正曲，必拿盆曲引起，有點像大戲中念的引子，及定塲詩，又像小說中正文前，開首的詩詞。正曲唱的是水　，聊　，及其他筆記中故事。類如宋江殺媳，楊雄醉酒，水莽拿，社小雪，卓二娘勸夫等，是他常常彈唱的。</p>
<p>榮劍　眞能拿書中原文，詳詳細絀按北京普通語言，說得十分明白，能　呌婦　都個，就是原文言外之意，也能一一說得透澈，眞可以說是一個字都不放過，因為他宇眼深，肚子寬，硏究按紅牙板，淺斟低唱的。手裏的鼓，與單弦節奏相應和，不迂腐，不瑣碎，有一種說不出來的美妙，就是文墨極　的人，　了也不由得鼓掌呌好．想想自，已要是登台彈唱，決計不能到這種地步，也決不能有這樣成績。平津一戴，也有小姑娘唱這種大鼓，號稱某人傳投，可是陶無點雲，只曉得挿科打　，那就不登大雅之堂了。　識她的，除非是醉翁之意不在酒。就是何質臣，常　田，也是有名的　弦，可是字眼，籌究得不如劍　　，總免不了帶點俗氣。其中要算謝瑞芝，說唱都夠得上冷　兩　字，就是時髦文言的幽默，天津最吃香。要拿劍農的大鼓如初寫黃庭，恰到好處相比，尙不能說是在伯仲之間。南邊人有句口號，三年出一儸狀元，三十年出不了一個大面，我說劍臨　，是八角鼓伏元，不能說過譽吧。（上）</p>

<h3>春夢一般還鄉</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>褪了色的「春之夢」</p>
<p>一個村姑因為愛慕虛榮，她拋棄了變人　　，嫁給了一個關少爺，後來她深深地後悔了。但是青春不再，她終於在含恨中死去，——這樣一個題材，嚴格地講起來是屬於那些「禮拜六派」的作品，同時在這個劇本裏，你簡直嗅不到一點時代的氣息，有的只是陳舊的褪了色的故事。</p>
<p>編導者朱石麟自「同病不相憐」「各有千秋」至這次「春之夢」，依然沒有跳越過他那　舊的思想，他　每一個人相安於現實，即使是不對的，也應該忍受，忍受，第三個還是忍受。——你為一個時代敎育的武器（電影），我們是不能不指出這一點的。</p>
<p>胡　演的十八歲少女，看來極為不舒服，中年時尙見穩健，這裏胡　給人的印象畢竟是老了。陳娟娟的小鳳尙佳，白沉太過火了。舒適的丁其昌有着豐富的演技。</p>
<p>諷刺的「還鄉日記」</p>
<p>勝利了，多少人對還鄕優着一般的美麗，但是多少人在現實面前幻滅了這個還鄕的美夢。劇中迄一對小夫婦，在復員來到上海後的一段經歷，正說明了那醜惡的一面。編導者袁俊抓住了現實題材來闡發的，也是値得介紹的。但是在劇本的編寫上，許多人物的插入與故事的發展，都顯得生硬。而戲又顯然有被剪刪的痕跡，所以看起來覺得有斷續之感。</p>
<p>導演對戲的處理，基調沒有把握住，在緊張雜亂的塲面裏，缺少了適當的節奏，而鏡頭的運用，也缺少靈活與創迭，也許是導演對電影技衛尙缺乏熟練的經騐。</p>
<p>演員中以白楊最佳，呂恩次之，耿雲較呆板了些，陽華十分火氣。</p>
<p>技術上，攝影，錄　，置景均在水古以下。</p>
<p>輕鬆的喜劇「陌生夫妻」</p>
<p>「陌生夫妻」的題材是夠使人感到輕鬆　有趣的，片中故事的發展也安排得頗為合理，大概這是一張在戰時攝成的勞軍片。導演對戲的處理無獨創之處，成績也僅平庸而已。</p>
<p>充滿了人情味的「玉女神駒」</p>
<p>這是一張値得介紹的好片子，不論是編劇，導演，演員，攝影，無一不在水準之上。尤其是故事中充滿了人情味，使你對它發生了無限的喜愛。</p>
<p>說起來故事是極為簡單的，描寫了一個家庭裏的瑣碎事情，然而它使你感到親切，細膩。導演就是「人類的喜劇」的導演克萊倫斯勃朗，他為你帶來了一如「人類的喜劇」一般的優秀成績。</p>
<p>米　羅納雖然在本片中有着優秀的成績，但我們要推薦那位演玉女的小明星伊麗沙白泰勒，她那生動細膩而自然的演技，精湛純真的感情，在在都使你感到她的可愛。此外賈克瓊金斯也是可愛的小傢伙</p>
<p>傳記片「一代佳人」</p>
<p>「一代佳人」是描寫十八世紀末葉，美國總統哲斐遜當選前後，國務卿傑娛和他的政敵亞隆之間的一段角社蓮變愛史上反映了美國人民對於自由與獨栽之間的選擇，雖然這裏是「美國式」的自由，但是作者的正義感，依然是僅得嘉許的。</p>
<p>琴遂羅吉絲有着極為優秀的演出，雖不多全應只注重了她一個人的戲，大衛　文的亞慶太浮滑了，沒有致治家的風度。</p>
<p>大導演　才琪在這張片子中，只　　了清　　　而已。</p>

<h3>US Emphasizes the Situation in the Far East, Sends Special Envoy Wedemeyer to China; Marshall Plan Expected to Expand to Asia</h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, Washington, 11th] The White House announced today that General Wedemeyer (see picture) will soon travel to China and Korea to inspect the general situation in the region. Wedemeyer's mission is to investigate facts, and he will be accompanied by several experts. Wedemeyer is expected to return to the United States within six weeks to submit a report to President Truman. Wedemeyer will travel to China with the following staff members in the capacity of ambassador and special representative of President Truman: Finance Advisor, Mr. Jenkins of the Far Eastern Division of the Treasury Department; Political Advisor, Mr. Spress of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department; Engineering Advisor, Rear Admiral Texel of the Navy's Civil Engineering Corps; Economic Advisor, Mr. Wilkes of the State Department's Economic Development Office; Public Relations Advisor, Mr. Watson of the Baltimore Sun.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] President Truman has appointed former U.S. military commander in China, General Wedemeyer, as the head of an emergency fact-finding mission to China and Korea, leading political and economic advisors to study the possibility of extending the Marshall Plan to China and the Far East. The President's decision seems to indicate a change in U.S. policy towards China, influenced by domestic and Chinese pressures to support President Chiang's war against the Communists. General Wedemeyer, like Secretary of State Marshall, is a military man, and his appointment to this position is considered significant. It is said that Wedemeyer sympathizes with the National Government and its anti-communist stance. Wedemeyer's current position as a special envoy of the President is similar to that held by Marshall a year ago, but the purpose of the mission is different. Marshall was previously a peace envoy, responsible for mediating the Chinese civil war, while Wedemeyer's current mission is to comprehensively assess the situation in China and Korea.</p>
<h3>President and Our Government Welcome Wedemeyer's Visit to China; Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The news that General Wedemeyer has been appointed as a special representative of President Truman, with ambassadorial rank, and will soon lead experts to China and Korea for inspection, has spread throughout the capital, filling people with excitement. It is widely believed that this move indicates the United States will strengthen its aid to China, and it is hoped that this friend of China will once again cooperate with President Chiang to contribute to the stability of the Far East. Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh, with unprecedented speed, issued a statement on behalf of President Chiang and our government expressing welcome. Wang said on the afternoon of the 12th: "President Chiang and the Chinese government welcome the appointment of General Wedemeyer as President Truman's special representative to China. General Wedemeyer is an old and close friend of China. During his service in the China Theater after the war, he made significant contributions to strengthening the China Theater and promoting cooperation between China and the United States, for which the Chinese people deeply admire him. I firmly believe that General Wedemeyer's visit will enhance the American people's deeper understanding of the situation in China, thereby enhancing friendship and cooperation between China and the United States. This will also be beneficial to the general situation in the Far East."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, stated: "Mr. Wedemeyer is familiar with the situation in the Far East, and I am delighted to hear that he has been sent to investigate the actual situation. This shows the active concern of the United States for the situation in the Far East. The situation in the Far East, from an international perspective, is closely related to the peace, security, and economic stability of the entire world."</p>
<h3>Assisting Our Government in Promoting Economic Recovery: The Mission of Special Envoy Wedemeyer's Visit to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] It has been learned here that the primary objective of General Wedemeyer's mission to China is to study how the United States can help the Chinese National Government without wasting its money.</p>
<p>The U.S. decision to send a high-level emergency mission was prompted by the following two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Senate Chairman Vandenberg has been continuously urging the United States for six months to shift its policy focus to China, providing assistance to the National Government in resisting inflation and the Communists.</p>
<p>(2) Secretary of State Marshall, after mediating in China for over a year, still feels that there is insufficient information to determine how the United States should provide international assistance to China.</p>
<p>The United States chose Wedemeyer as the head of the mission because he has always been sympathetic to the Chinese National Government. Wedemeyer will be the second high-level special envoy to China after the war. Some observers express doubts about his chances of success. It is learned that Wedemeyer's additional mission to Korea will be secondary. Although officials insist that the White House's statement has no "hidden meaning" and that the mission is purely for "fact-finding," observers still believe that this move may have broader objectives, including the following:</p>
<p>(1) Determining how to assist China's economic recovery, the first step of which may be what the Secretary of Commerce hinted at last week: extending the Marshall Plan to Asia.</p>
<p>(2) Deciding whether the United States, after months of maintaining a neutral stance, should fully support President Chiang with justice and material resources in the war against the Communists.</p>
<p>(3) Analyzing the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding the establishment of a provisional government in Korea to determine whether the U.S. will act alone in South Korea, as Secretary of State Marshall previously proposed at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>(4) Providing opinions on whether the Korean military government can be replaced by civil administration and handed over to the State Department. A special aid plan for Korea worth $200 million is still under study and has not yet been submitted to Congress.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in China, Walter Bedell Smith, will report to Secretary of State Marshall on the 14th regarding the deteriorating situation in China since Marshall left China in January. It is rumored that Smith may succeed Vincent as the Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department. It is said that Vincent has been criticized by pro-Nanjing figures as being unsympathetic to the Chinese National Government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall's appointment of Wedemeyer as a special envoy to investigate China and Korea for the first time links China and Korea together, indicating that the United States now believes that the two countries have a common problem that needs to be solved. Foreign sources have repeatedly reported that the Korean Communists are fighting in the Three Eastern Provinces, which is one part of this development. However, the U.S. government's selection of Wedemeyer to go to China indicates that he will only conduct investigations on the government side. Observers here believe that the Soviet Union's failure to return administrative power over Dalian and Lushun to China will be a key focus of Wedemeyer's investigation. Considering Wedemeyer's current appointment, it is expected that the United States will adopt a new policy toward China within two months.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Far East Policy, Investigating the Situations in China and Korea</h3>
<p>Both the People's and Youth Parties Welcome Wedemeyer</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] An authoritative source here stated that Wedemeyer's visit to China and Korea to "investigate the facts" is likely the beginning of the United States strengthening its Far East policy. Since Marshall took office as Secretary of State half a year ago, his policy towards the Far East has not been as active as his policy towards Europe. The recent issues of Dalian and Lushun, the Beitashan Incident, and the Seoul negotiations all indicate that the U.S. authorities need to reconsider their Far East policy. The authoritative source also pointed out that Wedemeyer's appointment comes after the United States lifted the arms embargo on China, and Wedemeyer's visit to China coincides with our country's implementation of nationwide mobilization, so its importance is self-evident.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Yu Chia-chu of the Youth Party's Executive Committee told reporters on the 12th regarding Wedemeyer's visit to China that the envoy's trip will be of great benefit to our country's current economic situation, so he is more optimistic about U.S. loans. However, he believes that Wedemeyer's trip will not have any impact on the military aspect. Hu Hai-men of the Democratic Socialist Party's Executive Committee told reporters that it is extremely welcome that the U.S. President can send a special envoy to China, and at the same time, it will further enhance the friendship between China and the United States.</p>
<h3>New York Newspapers Emphasize the Increase in Sino-US Relations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 11th] Although New York newspapers did not comment on Wedemeyer's new mission, the reports of each newspaper emphasized: "This reflects Marshall's concern for the situation in China, as well as his trust in this wartime commander of the US military in China." The New York Times reported: "It is generally believed that Wedemeyer's new appointment has dispelled China's concerns that the United States will abandon it. At the same time, rumors that Wedemeyer will replace Stuart as the U.S. Ambassador to China have also been clarified." The Times stated: "It is reported that Wedemeyer was not interested in this position, but was finally persuaded to take on this investigation work." The newspaper's Washington correspondent stated: "It is too early to predict whether this move will lead to the implementation of economic and other assistance under Truman's policy or the expansion of the Marshall Plan to Asia. It is reported that Wedemeyer is quite clear about this policy in his mind. His mission is to determine what the United States can do to promote China's recovery. It is generally believed that Wedemeyer's interest in finding ways to promote the unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is far less than his interest in more deeply studying the country's various difficulties."</p>
<h3>Preliminary Draft of Sino-Dutch Civil Aviation Agreement Signed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Sino-Dutch Air Transport Agreement, after six rounds of negotiations, is about to be finalized. At 11:00 AM on the 12th, Ling Shih-fen, advisor to the Ministry of Transportation who presided over the negotiations on the Chinese side, and Duesen, the head of the Dutch delegation, signed the preliminary draft agreed upon by both parties in the Ministry of Transportation's conference room, congratulating each other on the smooth success of the negotiations. The content of the draft agreement is roughly based on the standard agreement drafted by the Chicago International Civil Aviation Conference. At the moment, both parties will submit the draft to their respective governments for approval, and then the Dutch Ambassador and the Chinese Foreign Minister will sign on behalf of the two countries. Duesen and his party are scheduled to leave China and return to their country on the 13th.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Ambassador Stuart is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 14th. He will return to Beiping in two weeks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] When asked about Wedemeyer's mission, Ambassador Stuart, who is currently in Beiping, replied that he had no comments.

<h3>Naming Principles for Warships Allotted to Our Country Decided; Commemorate Ancestors and Use Names of Heroes Who Expanded Territory</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The naming issue of the eight Japanese compensation warships allotted to our country is currently being solicited by Commander-in-Chief Kuei Yung-ching and is about to be finalized. The principle has been decided to use the names of famous generals and heroes in our country's history who expanded the territory, such as "Cheng Kung" and "Ting Yuan," to commemorate the ancestors and look forward to the future meritorious service of the warships themselves. Most of the warships' firearms and equipment have been dismantled. After the repairs and replacement are completed, they will be used as training ships, and the cadets and officers on these ships will be the future drivers of these ships.</p>
<h3>Friend of the Chinese People: General Wedemeyer</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Data Room</p>
<p>In early April of last year, General Wedemeyer ended the headquarters of the U.S. military in the China Theater and returned home successfully. Before his departure, he held a final press conference in Shanghai. Chinese and foreign reporters gave speeches one after another, expressing deep respect for General Wedemeyer's character and achievements, and unanimously said that they hoped General Wedemeyer would one day receive a new appointment and return to China. Now, this friend of the Chinese people has indeed been appointed as President Truman's special representative with the rank of ambassador and is preparing to come to China again.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer's name is linked to China's victory. He served as the Chief of Staff of the China Theater during the late stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, helping China win the victory, and also took on the arduous task of repatriating Japanese prisoners of war after the war. In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, it was the darkest period in the history of China's War of Resistance. At that time, the Japanese army launched an all-out invasion of the Chinese mainland, trying to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Fierce battles were taking place outside the city of Guilin, an important city in the southwest. It was at this time that General Wedemeyer succeeded General Stilwell as the Commander of the U.S. Military in the China Theater and the Chief of Staff of the China Theater Command, assisting President Chiang, training troops, replenishing equipment, and resisting the enemy's offensive. In the year after General Wedemeyer took office, the situation in the China Theater improved day by day. Finally, in August of the 35th year of the Republic of China, Japan surrendered.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer is a soldier who has experienced many battles and is very strategic. Ten days before the end of World War I, he graduated from West Point Military Academy. He has studied military affairs at the Staff College and the Army University in Berlin, Germany. In the 1930s, he was sent to China and stationed in the U.S. military in Tianjin for a short period of time. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, he served on the Strategic Committee of the Department of War, and made many contributions to the decision-making of the Allied war strategy. In October 1943, he was sent to the headquarters of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia as Deputy Chief of Staff, and since then he has been related to the war situation in Asia. Due to his bravery, wisdom and agility, he was soon appointed as the Commander of the U.S. Military in the China Theater.</p>
<p>From the American point of view, this distinguished general is still very young. He was born in 1896, and this year he is only fifty years old. He has a thin figure, a straight nose, light gray hair, and a pair of soft eyes shining with a solemn and profound light. He doesn't drink much alcohol, but he smokes a lot of cigarettes. When he talks to others, his slow and steady voice often gives people a very deep impression.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer himself said: He loves China and loves all the people of China. When he took over the duties of the China Theater that year, he said: "I love them, I am here to serve them."</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming on Inspection Tour</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] Taiwan Chairman Wei Daoming, accompanied by Acting Director of Civil Affairs Zhu Foding and Director of the Preparatory Department Niu Xianming, went on an inspection tour on the 12th. He will first go to the central and southern counties and cities of Taiwan Province for inspection, and is scheduled to return to Taipei in a week.</p>
<h3>Issue of Equal Treatment for Civilian and Military Personnel</h3>
<p>To Be Discussed by the Executive Yuan Budget Committee</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Executive Yuan Budget Review Committee held its second temporary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 12th. Wu Yunwu chaired the meeting. The main topic of discussion was the case of equal treatment for civilian and military personnel, which included (1) salaries, (2) non-staple food expenses, and (3) horse feed salary issues. The principle is to give them the same treatment as civilian personnel, but since the ranks and positions of military personnel are different from those of civilian personnel, for example, military staff members may be majors or lieutenant colonels, or even colonels. If generals, colonels, and lieutenants are compared with senior, recommended, and appointed grades, there will be differences from the current position. If the position is compared with civilian officials, there will be differences from the original military rank. No results were obtained in today's discussion, and it was decided to hand it over to the Accounting Department of the Executive Yuan to consult with the Ministry of National Defense for further discussion. The non-staple food expenses have been increased to 50,000 yuan per person per month. Horse feed is calculated at 300,000 yuan per horse. The expenses required to prepare for the second-line forces were also discussed at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Senior Representatives of the American Cotton Association Arrive in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Memphis, Tennessee, 12th] The National Cotton Council announced that ten senior American representatives will soon go to Shanghai to investigate the possibility of selling American cotton to the Chinese market next year.

The delegation includes Wilson, Director of the New York Cotton Exchange, Cleven of the Department of the Army, White of the Department of Agriculture, Evans of the Department of State, and Schneeis of the Department of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Colonial Bank Ordered to Suspend Business for Liquidation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] According to the Ministry of Finance, the Tianjin Colonial Bank was unable to circulate funds on June 26 and was suspended from exchange by the Central Bank. Upon receiving the report, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the bank to suspend business for liquidation.</p>
<h3>Northern Xinjiang Beitashan: Outer Mongolian Troops Hastily Building Fortifications; Military Personnel Concerned About Next Action</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Dihua via Central News Agency, 12th] It has been learned from military sources that the number of Mongolian army horses at Baiyanggou Pass on the Beitashan front has decreased by two-thirds. The military is currently hastily constructing fortifications, and military personnel here are paying close attention to this. One military observer stated: Since the Mongolian army's invasion began on June 5th, it has been over 30 days. Each time, the Mongolian army launched attacks with superior forces, but were repelled by our troops. In total, the Mongolian army has launched over ten attacks in less than a month. At the beginning of the war, the Mongolian army fought fiercely day and night under the cover of aircraft, but ultimately suffered losses and retreated. It is believed that the Mongolian side is now well aware of the determination of our soldiers to defend our territory and their bravery in combat. In order to seize Beitashan, a key military location, a large-scale military operation is inevitable. The current actions of the Mongolian army will likely be chosen from the following paths: (1) Abandoning the attempt to seize Beitashan; (2) Shifting troops to another location in an attempt to outflank our rear positions. The former is highly unlikely, considering the Mongolian army's aggressive ambitions and the intentions of a certain party to harm China. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the Mongolian army's next action and strengthen our defenses to avoid being caught off guard. Further news: The defending troops at Beitashan were greatly heartened upon hearing the central government's announcement of a general mobilization order.</p>
<h3>Two Mongolian Banner Institutions in Chahar Province Hold Symposium in Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Zhangjiakou via Central News Agency, 11th] The Chahar Provincial Mongolian Banner Special Envoy Office and the Mongolian Banner Cultural and Welfare Committee convened a symposium in Zhangjiakou on the 11th, inviting princes, heads, and party secretaries from various banners. During the discussion, the princes spoke enthusiastically, all agreeing that suppressing the rebellion was the most urgent task. They requested the government to quickly eliminate the bandits and restore order so that long-term construction could be undertaken.</p>
<h3>National Government Order</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing via Central News Agency, 12th] The National Government issued an order on the 13th: Appointing He Jian as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee.</p>
<h3>Frugality Guidelines Drafted; To Be Submitted to the Full Economic Commission Meeting for Discussion; Zhang Jia'ao Claims 500 Million Loan is Hopeful</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 12th] The "Measures for Implementing Frugality in Consumption" proposed by President Zhang were further studied at a meeting of the National Economic Commission's subcommittee on the afternoon of the 12th. A "Outline of Measures for Implementing Frugality in Consumption" has been drafted and will be submitted to the plenary session next Thursday after the wording is finalized. Today's meeting was convened by Wang Yunwu, and attended by Gu Zhenggang, He Haoruo, Huang Yuanbin, and Lou Tongjiang, among others. The meeting decided to promote frugality simultaneously in both the public and general social spheres, with particular emphasis on Shanghai, with the goal of reducing all expenses. Even essential supplies such as gasoline will be subject to reductions. Furthermore, a suggestion made at the previous plenary meeting regarding the implementation of production rationalization was discussed today, and it was decided that a separate plan would be formulated.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The subcommittee of the Economic Commission also reviewed the "Joint Export Sales" plan proposed by the Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Joint Management Company. The committee attached great importance to this plan. According to the plan, the government would provide loans to various manufacturers, who would then produce finished products and export them to Southeast Asia and other regions, earning foreign exchange for the country. This plan would greatly benefit the cotton textile industry's production and foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper in Beiping, 12th] Zhang Jia'ao arrived in Beiping by plane at 1:00 PM today. After inspecting the Central Bank's branch and general financial operations here, he will proceed to Tianjin for inspection. A decision on whether he will visit the Northeast has not yet been made. Zhang stated to reporters: (1) The US$500 million loan will not be revoked due to the June deadline. The government has already submitted transportation sector construction plans to Washington, and plans for other sectors' use of the loan are also being prepared. (2) The lifting of the gold ban is unlikely. Rumors that the government will allow private gold exchanges for foreign currency are a misunderstanding regarding public bonds that can be exchanged for US dollars. (3) Recent talk of currency system reforms is purely a rumor, and adjustments to foreign exchange rates are also inaccurate.</p>
<p>Communist Destruction of Northeast Economy</p>
<p>[Joint Dispatch from Shenyang, 12th] The Northeast economy is suffering from the blows of the civil war and the constraints of trade regulations. The difficult situation in the Northeast can be exemplified by the China Textile Corporation. Despite all the advantages of government management and monopoly, the company is on the verge of collapse. Only 10,000 to 20,000 of the 150,000 spindles are in operation. Jinzhou Factory No. 1 has suffered a major setback and may close down at any time. Communist sabotage of factories is the main reason for the shutdowns of factories in Liaoyang and Yingkou. Although the Northeast is supposedly rich in grain, it will be difficult to transport grain into the interior or to other locations this year. All of the Northeast's products must now be used to supply the local military and civilians.</p>
<p>Northern China is currently suffering from famine. A delegation from Beiping and Tianjin came to order 60,000 tons of grain, but the contract was ultimately canceled due to insufficient local supply. This situation stands in stark contrast to the period of Japanese occupation. The Japanese army transported approximately 3.5 million tons of sorghum, soybeans, wheat, and millet out of the Northeast each year, with 2 million tons going to Japan and the remainder going to the Soviet Union and Europe. The recent surge in grain prices is partly due to the lack of electricity for the mills to operate. Soybean, the Northeast's main product, saw exports of 240,000 tons last year, but less than 48,000 tons have been exported this year. It is rumored that the Chinese Communists are exporting large quantities of soybeans through the Soviet Union. The government claims this can be verified by fluctuations in London soybean prices. At the beginning of this year, London soybean prices were £47 per ton, but later fell to £35 per ton. This situation is unlikely to have been caused by large-scale exports from government-controlled areas.</p>

<p>[Report from Yanzhou via this Newspaper, 12th] The large-scale annihilation battle in the southern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains has come to an end. The main force of the Shandong Communist army has been dispersed and is fleeing in two directions, north and south. The National Army in the Tai'an, Dawenkou, and Jieshou areas, in order to concentrate its forces and avoid being surrounded by superior Communist forces, mostly made strategic withdrawals on their own initiative. After dispersing and depleting the Communist forces, they began a full-scale counterattack on the 11th. By the evening of the 12th, the National Army had advanced to the outskirts of Wande and Feicheng, and Feicheng will soon be recovered.</p>

<p>[Report from Xuzhou via this Newspaper, 12th] National Army reinforcements have been continuously arriving on both sides of the Lin-Zao and Lin-Yi Xin'anzhen highways. The remnants of the three columns, the 1st, 4th, and 5th, of the Communist forces, numbering over 10,000, who had infiltrated the Chu County, Zaozhuang, and Xiangcheng areas, have become turtles in a jar. It is no longer possible for them to flee to northern Jiangsu or cut off the Lin-Xin Highway. The war situation in southern Shandong will be clarified within days. On the evening of the 11th, the Communist forces in Yizao raided Heerzhuang, but were defeated by the defending forces and fled north.</p>
<p>[Report from Qingdao via this Newspaper, 12th] A major battle is brewing on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong. It is rumored that He Long's forces have infiltrated to aid western Shandong, joining forces with Liu Bocheng, and are attempting to cross the Longhai Railway from areas such as Caoxian to probe into Jiangsu Province. The National Army is deploying a large force eastward from Zhengzhou to provide reinforcements, and it is expected that the war situation will change as a result.</p>
<p>[Report from Xinpu via this Newspaper, 12th] Continuous heavy rains in the Yimeng Mountains of Shandong Province have caused mountain floods to flow southward, cutting off the bridges at the Caoqiao and Yunhe two stations on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. The military highway has also been submerged, and transportation between Xuzhou and Haizhou has been interrupted.</p>
<p>[Report from Yanzhou via this Newspaper, 12th] After Liu Bocheng's forces in western Shandong captured Yuncheng on the 7th, it is reported that their main force, three columns, joined with the Communist forces attacking Heze and attacked Dingtao. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, the National Army made a voluntary withdrawal on the evening of the 11th. The Communist forces continued to attack south from the 11th, seemingly resuming their attempt to cut off the Longhai Railway from the south. The National Army is currently blocking and attacking them.</p>
<p>[Report from Weixian via this Newspaper, 12th] It is reported that every week or ten days, a foreign warship fully loaded with ammunition and weapons arrives from Lushun and Dalian to unload in Yantai. It is also rumored that many Korean Communists were brought over on June 30th.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Obstructing Yellow River Embankment Restoration; Water Conservancy Department Releases Details; Communist Party Should Be Held Responsible If There Are Breaches When Flood Season Arrives</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing via this Newspaper, 12th] The Ministry of Water Conservancy released details on the Communist bandits' obstruction of the Yellow River embankment restoration project on the 12th. After listing the facts, it pointed out that the Communist bandits were deliberately trying to sabotage the river works. The representatives they sent to suggest negotiations were merely a smokescreen for their secret plan to cross the river and harass the southern bank. With the flood season approaching, the Communist bandits should be held responsible for any breaches in the river defenses in the future. The Ministry expressed gratitude to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for its human and material assistance in repairing our river defenses.</p>
<p>Repair Work from April to June</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Water Conservancy's announcement: From April to June this year, twenty-one brick and willow dams were completed at the dangerous worksites of Gao Village and Liu Village in Hebei Province, as well as 1,570 meters of bank protection work. Subsequently, 99,400 cubic meters of earthwork were used to create the embankment body and embankment top. Secondary dangerous worksites such as Lantong, Maodian, Laojuntang, and Baocheng were blocked and repaired, traffic ditches were filled, and defective projects such as gullies and wave nests were repaired with 27,500 cubic meters of earthwork. The earthwork project to reinforce the main embankment was 90 percent complete, totaling over 1.04 million cubic meters. At the dangerous worksites of Zhukou and Dongzhuang in Shandong Province, and the 25-kilometer-long embankment from Zhukou to Beizhuang, by the end of June, the Zhukou Dam (11 dikes and 14 weirs) and the Dongzhuang Dam (12 dikes and 34 weirs), as well as the earthwork section from Zhukou to Dongzhuang, had been completed. Active repairs were also underway on the main embankment at various worksites in Henan Province, and the breaches at Wuchekou and Donghongqiao in the main section of the Qin River were being blocked. The repair work in the three provinces was scheduled to be completed by July 10, but the Communist bandits' sudden large-scale crossing of the river on June 30 affected all projects. The Communist side's suggestions for consultation since April 11 also proved their lack of sincerity.</p>
<p>Facts of Communist Obstruction of River Works</p>
<p>Since the closing of the Huayuankou breach on March 15, the main facts of the Communist bandits' obstruction of the river works are as follows: On March 31, when the Hebei River Defense Office was repairing dangerous worksites at Liu Village in Dongming, the bandit army suddenly attacked, dispersing the workers and seizing two engineers. On April 28, the entire main embankment on the north bank of Hebei Province was occupied by the bandit army, and the whereabouts of some of the workers are unknown. On May 16, the bandit army suddenly attacked the Second Section of the First Main Section of the Wenxian Blocking Bureau. Clerk Cui Zhixin was killed in the line of duty, tools and vehicles were looted, and the remaining employees were detained in the puppet Public Security Bureau, where they were tortured. Five workers, including Zhao Yongsan, Chang Gong, and Liu Jinshan, were captured, and their whereabouts are unknown. On June 10, the Communist bandits opened fire on the workers at the Zhukou Longmenkou bank protection and stone dam construction site in Shandong Province from the north bank. On the afternoon of June 28, the Communist army on the opposite bank of the Liu Village Grand River in Hebei Province built several pillboxes on the north bank and fired at the south bank, obstructing the project. On the afternoon of June 30, bandit troops crossed the river from the north bank below Beikou on a large scale, a serious situation. Furthermore, bandit mobs forced the employees of the Shandong River Defense Office and the western Shandong Office in Linpu to evacuate this morning. Over 20,000 bandit troops from Heze have crossed the river, and the section east of Linpu has been occupied. According to a report from Ma Zhendong, Section Chief of the Shandong River Defense Office, over a dozen employees at the Zhonggudui construction site were captured, and the project has been completely suspended. On the afternoon of July 4, 200 to 300 Communist bandits were discovered destroying embankment structures in the Jia Village to Heling area in Heze County. After the local militia and the National Army joined forces to suppress them, the bandits fled east.</p>

After a short rest, the Volunteer Army soldiers were divided into batches and transported to Jiaotong University in 30 trucks for rest and meals. Members of various circles in the city distributed relief supplies. The Executive Headquarters issued travel expenses (24,000 yuan per person) and bread (10 pounds per person). The Volunteer Army soldiers boarded the Xiangxing wheel that night and set sail at 8:00 AM this morning. They are expected to arrive in Yingkou in three days.

<h3>MacArthur Issues Statement; Advocates Early Peace Treaty with Japan; Japan Will Never Be Able to Re-Arm in a Century</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Tokyo via Central News Agency, 12th] MacArthur issued a statement today, saying: Japan will not be able to re-arm and engage in modern warfare for a century, even without foreign control. Furthermore, the Allied nations should conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. MacArthur's statement today was commenting on the Far Eastern Commission's decision on the post-war disposition of Japan. MacArthur believes that the peace treaty with Japan should be a charter of human freedom, allowing the Japanese people to receive guidance and protection without causing them to feel ashamed and retreat. The peace treaty with Japan should avoid punitive, arbitrary, and impractical provisions, but fundamentally it must not lose its firmness. If so, the Taiwanese people in Japan will certainly obtain peace.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Foreign Minister Ashida Hitoshi commented on the Far Eastern Commission's new policy on Japanese reparations today, saying: Japan will certainly faithfully fulfill its reparations obligations in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration. However, Japan sincerely hopes that the Allied nations will consider that Japan's current economy has reached its lowest level when deciding on the issue of Japanese reparations. Continuing to increase its burden will inevitably delay Japan's economic recovery and its return to being a member of the world's peaceful economic society.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Moscow via Central News Agency, 11th] An observer for the Soviet Union's Izvestia criticized the current Allied occupation policy towards Japan today, saying that the result of this policy is that the Japanese militarists feel that Japan is not an aggressor but a victim of aggression, who urgently needs to be sympathized with. This situation recently caused Hitoshi Ashida to give a speech, while no one (whether Allied occupation authorities or the Japanese Diet) felt it necessary to refute it. This move further prompted Yukio Ozaki to suggest holding a plebiscite in the Northeast, Korea, and Taiwan to determine who these lands should belong to.</p>
<h3>Pigs and Cattle Drowned in Yuehan Railway Accident; Losses Amount to 300 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from Guangzhou via this Newspaper, 12th] After the tragic Yuehan Railway train accident, Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Yue Railway Bureau, personally led technicians and rescue personnel to continue the rescue efforts.

This is currently being investigated. (Above) Sun Qinglin (second from the left), leader of the Northeast Volunteer Army, poses with welcomers at the train station.

(3) Pang Bingxun, Zhao Dingxin, Shi Jiadong, and Huang Yaxiang will appeal to all circles for assistance.</p>

<h3>Welcome General Wedemeyer to China!</h3>
<p>The White House in Washington officially announced on the 11th that President Truman had appointed General Wedemeyer as a special envoy, with the rank of ambassador, to lead a fact-finding mission composed of political and economic experts to the Far East. The mission will investigate the actual situations in China and Korea, complete a report within six weeks, and return to the country to report on its mission. This important announcement can be seen not only as an indication of the United States extending the Truman Doctrine to the Far East, but also as the beginning of a change in US policy toward China. According to a report by the United Press, General Wedemeyer's mission to the Far East has four tasks: (1) to determine how to stabilize the Chinese economy so that Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan can be implemented in Asia as well; (2) to ascertain whether the United States should abandon its neutral stance in the Chinese civil war and support the Chinese National Government with moral and material strength; (3) to analyze the stalemate in US-Soviet negotiations to form a provisional Korean government in order to decide whether the United States should act alone in southern Korea; (4) to consider the military situation in Korea in order to decide whether the Korean government should be transferred from the US military to the State Department for management. Based on these four points alone, the importance of General Wedemeyer's mission to the East is evident.</p>
<p>Every time Sino-US relations encounter a serious test, we are often reminded of General Wedemeyer. Last July and August, when Marshal Marshall encountered difficulties in mediating the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists in China, there were rumors that General Wedemeyer might come to China to assist Marshal Marshall in promoting China's peaceful unification. At the end of June this year, the failure to release the 500 million loan put Sino-US relations to another major test, and the rumors of General Wedemeyer coming to China came one after another. Now, the rumor that General Wedemeyer has been ordered to come to China has finally come true. I remember that when General Wedemeyer came to China in the autumn of 1944 to take office as Commander of the US Forces in the China Theater and Chief of Staff to Chairman Chiang, it was the most difficult period of China's resistance against Japan. The National Army not only suffered setbacks on the battlefield, but also felt extremely poor in terms of material resources. Incomplete equipment and insufficient nutrition made it almost impossible to fight against the enemy forces, who had advantages in everything. However, after General Wedemeyer came to China, based on his belief that "American and Chinese soldiers should be treated equally," he intensified the training of Chinese troops and provided them with American equipment. Within a few months, not only did Sino-US relations become closer, and American and Chinese soldiers fighting side by side on the Chinese battlefield almost became friends in adversity who shared life and death, but China also had as many as 39 divisions of American-equipped troops. Trained by General Wedemeyer's "golden rules," they were all able to be friendly without being subservient, democratic without being indulgent, and frank without being restrained. From then on, the Chinese battlefield saw daily changes, and a year later, Japan finally surrendered unconditionally. China's arduous eight-year war of resistance also achieved final victory. General Wedemeyer's achievements will naturally never be erased from the minds of the Chinese people. General Wedemeyer returned to the United States in early April last year, having been in China for two years. He is not only Chairman Chiang's confidant, deeply aware of Chairman Chiang's personality and strengths, and praised Chairman Chiang as "a true Christian who is selfless and only wants to help the people," but also a friend of the Chinese people. He understands the feelings and aspirations of the Chinese people best; therefore, when he left Shanghai to return to the United States, so many people hated to see him go, and he also felt the pain of being reluctant to leave. Even after he returned to the country, he still never forgot China. Now, General Wedemeyer is revisiting the old place after a year and three months. Although the time is short, he will definitely feel doubly affectionate. As we know, General Wedemeyer is already familiar with the political situation in China, and he will know the inside story even without investigation. However, we still want to point out that in the year and three months since General Wedemeyer returned to the United States, China has undergone many changes in politics, economy, society, and culture. Ambassador Stuart knows this very well. After General Wedemeyer comes to China, in addition to conducting on-the-spot investigations, he must also listen to Ambassador Stuart's opinions on China's political economy.</p>
<p>We sincerely welcome General Wedemeyer and the members of the delegation to China for a thorough investigation. We always feel that some Americans do not have a sufficient understanding of the actual situation in China due to their cursory observations, especially a few writers who inevitably rely on hearsay. After returning to the country, they publish articles in newspapers and magazines, which American readers believe to be facts they have personally experienced, and take them as true, but we feel surprised when we read them. For example, the American female writer Anna Louise Strong went to the Northeast once in October last year, and in May this year, she published an article in the magazine Amerasia, entitled "A Communist Regime in the Northeast." It can be said that she was completely deceived by the Chinese Communists, only seeing the surface of the Communist-controlled areas in the Northeast, and not knowing its actual operation. Therefore, all the reports are completely inconsistent with the facts. To be honest, there are still some misunderstandings between the people of China and the United States today that should not exist. Therefore, we most welcome people from all walks of life in the United States, especially experts who understand politics and economics and have practical experience, to come to China to see things clearly. The significance of our sincere welcome to General Wedemeyer, a friend of China, and his accompanying political and economic experts to China for on-the-spot investigations lies in this.</p>
<p>Finally, we also have a few words to say to the Chinese government: General Wedemeyer's investigation team's visit to China to conduct on-the-spot investigations of China's political situation is of great significance. It is not only related to China, but will also contribute to the overall situation in the Far East and the future of the entire world. The Chinese government should sincerely and frankly tell the team about the country's internal affairs. What are China's current weaknesses? Where are the root causes of the problems? The government should, to the best of its knowledge, tell General Wedemeyer one by one, as reference for him to draft the report. Concealing illness from doctors is something that patients should try to avoid. We must never intend to conceal anything when a good doctor makes a diagnosis. The overall situation of the country is too serious! The evolution of the overall situation in the world is also truly unpredictable! We must immediately reflect on ourselves first. For problems that we can solve ourselves, we must quickly find solutions ourselves, and we must not intend to seek help from others in everything. Moreover, even if the United States intends to help China and intends to assist the National Government, our government must first be extremely honest and efficient, and must first respect the rights and interests of the people everywhere, care for the welfare of the people, and truly be one with the people, so that it is truly a "national government." Only then will the "government supported by the people" that Ambassador Stuart mentioned be truly seen by General Wedemeyer's investigation team in China, and then the United States will definitely be happy to do its best to help this newly emerging China.</p>
<h3>Europe is Divided!</h3>
<p>The European Economic Conference opened yesterday in Paris. Of all 27 countries in Europe, only representatives from 14 countries, including Italy, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland, and Sweden, attended, in addition to the two inviting countries, Britain and France. The Soviet Union and its eight satellite states refused the invitation and did not participate in the conference. According to a United Press report on the 11th, the Soviet Union will launch a counteroffensive against the Paris Conference, organizing a Central and Eastern European economic bloc to confront it. At the same time, Moscow Radio announced the "Molotov Plan." The division of Europe is almost a foregone conclusion, and it seems impossible to "unite" again. This is truly the beginning of a great human tragedy!</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's suspicion of the intentions of the Marshall Plan and its refusal to participate in the Paris Conference is the Soviet Union's own business, and no one can dissuade it. We have no objections. However, Poland, Albania, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania suffered destruction from artillery fire during the war. Now, if they want to talk about recovery and prosperity, they urgently need foreign aid. Why did they refuse to participate in the European Economic Conference? Apart from the pressure from the Soviet Union, there is really no other reason to explain it. In particular, Czechoslovakia had already expressed its willingness to participate in the Paris Conference, but as soon as the Czech Prime Minister and Foreign Minister arrived in Moscow, they changed their minds halfway and asked Britain and France to withdraw their replies, unwilling to participate in the Paris Conference. The lack of autonomy in the diplomacy of small countries and the control of small countries by powerful countries is ultimately too blatant.</p>
<p>Europe is divided, power politics is revived, and it makes us feel that true peace seems to be even more distant and even more elusive from this world!</p>

<h3>British and French Foreign Ministers Attend European Conference to Promote European Economic Cooperation, Still Hoping that Eastern European Countries Will Change Their Original Intentions, Implementing the Marshall Plan Is Not to Organize an Anti-Soviet Bloc</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 12th: The European Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe opened here today. Bevin and Bidault both attended and delivered speeches, denying that the conference was infringing upon the sovereignty and independence of European countries, and emphasized the importance of the conference for European economic recovery. Chairman Bevin, in his speech, declared to the Soviet Union and its eight satellite states that "the door of the conference is still wide open." Any country that can change its attitude and participate in the Marshall Plan is welcome. Bevin continued: "It is regrettable that the Soviet Union and some European countries have not been able to participate, but these countries must also have regrets in their hearts." Bevin stated: The conference is not preparing to establish a permanent organization to confront the United Nations, but in order to solve European economic problems, it is necessary to establish specialized committees. Bidault said in his speech: "The purpose of convening the conference is not to establish an anti-Soviet bloc. The main task is to improve the chaotic economic situation in Europe." Today's meeting lasted only one hour, making it the shortest meeting in history. The conference first unanimously elected Bevin as chairman, and then proceeded to discuss organizational procedures, establish working committees, and prepare the agenda for the conference. Later, Bevin announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was scheduled to hold its second meeting at 4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] After the opening ceremony of the European Conference, the working committee immediately held a meeting and unanimously elected Alphand, the economic director of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as chairman, and Sérurier, the director of the technical service of international conferences of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as secretary-general.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] Representatives of 16 Western European countries gathered in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to begin discussing Secretary of State Marshall's plan for aiding European recovery. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has not participated in major European conferences, which shows the seriousness of the division between Eastern and Western Europe. The conference will first organize several committees to study the degree of self-help in European countries and the amount of US assistance needed. Italy's participation in a major international conference on an equal footing is also the first time since the war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Foreign Minister Bidault will do his best to advocate that the Paris Economic Conference be completely open.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 12th: Moscow Radio claimed today that the reason why the European countries did not participate in the Marshall Plan conference was not to discriminate against the Marshall Plan, but mainly because the major powers did not discuss with the United States through Britain and France. These countries are willing to trade directly with the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] A commentator on Moscow Radio said: The refusal of eight countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia, to participate in the Paris Conference shows that the Paris Conference will inevitably fail. It is said that the refusal of the eight countries has greatly affected the plans of Britain and France, and Britain and France have returned to the dangerous policies of Munich.</p>
<h3>Marshall Explains the Current Situation of the US Aid to Europe Plan to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Soviet Union's Refusal to Cooperate Deepens the Rift Between East and West</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Secretary of State Marshall reported in a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 11th that the US efforts to aid Europe have been hit by the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the European Recovery Program, but will not be overturned as a result. In the 90-minute closed-door meeting, Marshall still hoped that he could eventually get the Soviet Union to participate in the long-term plan for European economic recovery. It is reported that Marshall told the committee that although the Soviet Union is currently refusing to cooperate, he hopes that the economic plan can still proceed. He believes that there is currently no need to establish a law to formulate an economic recovery plan, and implied that the plan may not be submitted to Congress for discussion until next spring. However, if this action is necessary, it is possible to establish a law within this year. Marshall also said: The Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Paris Conference has widened the rift between the Eastern and Western fronts in Europe, and the Soviet Union has exerted pressure on Czechoslovakia and other countries, forcing them not to participate in the Paris Conference, thus deepening the rift. It is reported that Marshall also told the senators that the State Department does not yet know to what extent the Soviet Union will proceed regarding the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with the United States and other Western powers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] The information revealed after Marshall's secret meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee proves that the United States believes that the door should still be open for another attempt at the entire European recovery plan, so as to avoid the permanent division between Western countries and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the attitude of the United States can be seen from its refusal to express any reaction to the "Molotov Plan" transmitted by TASS and the news that the Soviet Union will soon announce a "recovery plan for Eastern Europe."</p>
<h3>The Czech Cabinet Has a Uniform Opinion on Rejecting the British and French Invitations, There Were as Many as Five Breaks During the Meeting</h3>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 12th] Informed sources here today disclosed the inside story of the Czech Cabinet's change of mind regarding the Paris Economic Conference. It is said that after the Cabinet received a telephone call from Prime Minister Gottwald from Moscow yesterday, it convened an emergency meeting. Communist cabinet members debated with non-Communist cabinet members for six hours, and there were as many as five breaks in the middle. Finally, they accepted the proposal of the non-Communist cabinet members that the withdrawal statement must clearly state that this move was due to Soviet pressure. At that time, President Benes, who was non-partisan, said that he was powerless, and the opposition cabinet members gave up hope of participating in the meeting.</p>
<h3>Poland and Finland Still Hope to Obtain Foreign Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press, Warsaw, 11th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today: Poland deeply hopes that foreign capital will help its recovery, and it would be unfortunate if declining to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan creates an unfavorable impression in the United States. Although Poland's inability to obtain US aid will inevitably delay its recovery, Poland will still seek regeneration with the ability and enthusiasm of its own workers. Poland will apply to the World Bank for a loan of 600 million US dollars, hoping to approve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] Moscow Radio broadcast Finland's reply refusing to participate in the Paris Conference today, saying: "Finland's status has not yet been determined by the peace treaty. Since the Marshall Plan has caused serious disagreements between major countries, Finland is willing to stay out of world political conflicts and is unable to accept the invitation to participate in the Paris Conference, which is unfortunate. However, Finland is very willing to follow other countries in purely economic cooperation. For the sake of its own recovery, Finland also needs foreign assistance. The Finnish government is willing to provide information on the country's economy."</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia Established an Agreement to Expand Long-Term Trade, Soviet-Hungarian Negotiations Are Underway</h3>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 12th] According to reliable sources in Moscow: As a result of the talks between Czech Prime Minister Gottwald and the Soviet authorities in Moscow in recent days, the two sides have reached an agreement to expand long-term trade between the two countries as a condition for Czechoslovakia's withdrawal from the Paris Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The Hungarian Radio Station said: The Soviet-Hungarian negotiations in Moscow have agreed that Hungary will give half of the amount of compensation for the next year to the Soviet Union, which will greatly help alleviate the situation in Hungary and guarantee the supply of high-grade flour to Hungary. Also, negotiations on Hungary's purchase of 1,000 trucks from the Soviet Union are underway.</p>
<h3>The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Will Soon Loan to Britain</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] According to the "News Chronicle," the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development may grant Britain a loan of £75 million to renovate the industry in the Ruhr region of Germany. The loan agreement may be established in Washington soon.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Plans to Use the Molotov Plan to Resist US Foreign Aid and Seeks to Organize a Central and Eastern European Economic Bloc</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] Moscow Radio announced today: The Soviet Union has now drafted its own recovery plan, which is superior to any foreign aid to Europe. This plan is called the "Molotov Plan."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] On the eve of the opening of the Paris Conference, diplomatic circles here and in Paris predicted that the Soviet Union would launch a counteroffensive against it and organize a Central and Eastern European economic bloc. Representatives of 16 Western European countries have gathered in Paris and are scheduled to convene a meeting on the 12th on the last opportunity for US economic aid to revive Europe, while the Soviet Union and its eight countries in its sphere of influence have taken a resistant action. Therefore, diplomats said that Moscow will quickly carry out a counteroffensive plan in Eastern Europe so as to take into account the interests of countries that do not participate in the Paris Conference. The main difficulty for the Soviet Union is not how many countries it can recruit to the Eastern European bloc, but whether the Soviet Union can have sufficient materials to aid the countries so as to match the United States' aid to Western European countries. The side also pointed out that the Soviet Union had previously requested 80% of the Marshall Plan for its recovery. Because the Soviet Union lacks raw materials and manufactured goods, the Soviet Union is afraid that it can only supply a very small amount of materials to its vassal states. In this sense, the Paris Conference on the 12th will form a split in Europe.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe is brewing a mutual assistance system</p>
<p>Eastern European countries now seem to be forming a "mutual assistance" system within the Soviet sphere of influence. The Czech and Polish governments will reportedly establish a "Bilateral Economic Cooperation Committee" within a few days to discuss cooperation in industrial production between the two countries. According to reports, the Czech and Polish sides signed a commercial treaty last week. At the same time, Czechoslovakia and Poland have declared that they will soon begin negotiations with Hungary on a long-term commercial agreement. From August 1, Czechoslovakia will transport coking coal, iron, copper, and clay ore to Hungary to help it complete its three-year plan. According to reports, the Czech-Hungarian temporary commercial agreement has recently been established, and another negotiation will begin in Beijing in early August to make the temporary commercial agreement a permanent commercial agreement. A Hungarian business delegation will also go to Warsaw to conclude a Hungarian-Polish commercial agreement with Poland. The Hungarian government has also ordered major heavy industrial factories to transport factory equipment, machinery, and railway vehicles worth 20 million US dollars to Yugoslavia to help complete Yugoslavia's five-year plan. At the same time, Czechoslovakia is satisfied with the current Soviet-Czech commercial negotiations held in Moscow, and said that a new pier has been built in the city of Keno on the Soviet-Czech border to load and unload the goods of both sides. Bulgaria is currently holding economic negotiations with the Soviet Union. Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Kostov returned to Beijing from Moscow half a week ago, expanding an agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union will supply Bulgaria with machinery worth 10 million yuan to help it implement its two-year plan, while Bulgaria will transport a leaf of the same value to the Soviet Union. Bulgarian Minister of Resources Salov is still staying in Moscow to facilitate continued negotiations. In addition, the Soviet Union will send a delegation to Beijing to discuss the details of establishing a Bulgarian-Soviet airline. Although Finland and Bulgaria are far apart, they are also planning to increase economic relations between the two countries. A commercial delegation led by the Director of Foreign Trade of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently negotiating a Finnish-Bulgarian commercial agreement in Beijing.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Turkey Agreement Signed: Loan Funds to be Used to Strengthen National Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 12th (Broadcast); The U.S.-Turkey aid agreement was signed today in the Turkish capital. The Turkish representative was Foreign Minister Hejia, and the U.S. representative was U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Wilson. After the signing, the Turkish Foreign Minister stated that this agreement would not only enhance friendly relations between the two countries but also maintain world peace. The first clause of the agreement stipulates that Turkey must make good use of U.S. loans.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The United States and Turkey today signed a $100 million military aid agreement in Ankara to guarantee Turkey's resistance to Soviet pressure and to achieve "freedom and independence." The agreement is based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and aims to build friendly relations between the United States and Turkey. It was approved by the U.S. Congress on May 22.</p>
<p>The threat from the Soviet Union is not formally mentioned in the agreement, but the Soviet threat on Turkey's eastern border after the war has triggered a war of nerves, leading to the mobilization of the entire Turkish army. The $100 million loan will be used entirely for military equipment, training, and other projects, such as building Turkish railways to speed up the transport of troops and supplies. This agreement is the opposite of the Greek plan, where half is for military use and the other half for civilian use. According to the agreement, aid will be suspended in three situations: (1) if Turkey requests it; (2) if the UN Security Council or General Assembly deems the agreement "unnecessary or inappropriate"; (3) if the U.S. President decides to cancel the agreement for the benefit of the United States.</p>
<p>Allocation of Funds for Aid to Greece</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, Washington, 11th] The head of the U.S. delegation to Greece, Mr. Griswold, stated today that five major plans have been drawn up to complete the Aid to Greece Act, and $35 million worth of military supplies are awaiting shipment to Greece in various U.S. ports. The funds for the five major plans have been allocated as follows: $19 million for agricultural recovery, $48 million for construction, $35 million for civilian supplies, $3 million for public health, and $1.5 million for training administrative personnel. He will depart for Greece on the 13th and stated that $150 million will be used for military equipment for the Greek army, navy, and air force to suppress bandits. Military supplies include light mountain guns, animal feed, trucks, jeeps, and ammunition.</p>
<h3>Greek Communist Party: Conspiracy to Revolt</h3>
<p>Fortunately, Someone Informed, Preventing its Realization</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 11th] The Greek Minister of Public Security, Mr. Zilvas, spoke today about the communist conspiracy to overthrow the government, stating that the authorities had uncovered secret storage sites in Thessaloniki containing firearms, explosives, printing presses, and paper. The authorities also obtained a secret order from the Greek Communist Party to form a revolutionary army and launch an uprising. One person who received this secret order has also provided a confession. The secret order stipulates the following measures to be taken to carry out the orders of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party: (1) Greek Communist Party members should gather in Athens and other cities, posing as refugees; (2) Armories should be set up in Thessaloniki, Athens, Kavala, and other cities, and orders should be issued to equip Greek Communist guerrillas; (4) Orders should be issued to launch strikes and sabotage. Zilvas continued that an order issued by the guerrilla commander Markos was found in Thessaloniki, ordering the Communist Party to launch an armed uprising at 1:00 AM on the 10th. Fortunately, someone from within the Communist Party informed, preventing its success. In the secret Communist warehouse found in Nevara, there were Bulgarian typewriters, "Molotov cocktail" bombs, and automatic weapons. Secret armories were also uncovered in Athens and Thessaloniki. Zilvas promised to allow foreign journalists to inspect the secret documents obtained from various areas after the investigation is completed.</p>

Prime Minister Katayama not only did not refute the remarks of his subordinates but said that they had the right to express their personal views on foreign policy issues.

All of this is the result of the occupation authorities' connivance with Japanese militarists.</p>

<h3>Collusion for Self-Interest and Damage to the National Treasury: Yang Anren and Zhan Liansheng Convicted; Paying Out 2.5 Billion in Gold Before Receiving Funds is Clearly Illegal; Lin Fengbao Found Not Guilty Due to Lack of Evidence of Joint Collusion</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The "Gold Rush" case, which caused a national sensation, has been tried by the District Court since March 14, lasting four months, and was pronounced yesterday morning. Before the court session began, the defendants, former Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, and Deputy Director Yang Anren (wearing gray suits), sat quietly in the Eighth Criminal Court. At 9:30 AM, Judge Wang Jiachao ascended the bench, and the defendant in custody, Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Gold Industry Association, was brought in, followed by Lin and Yang, who stepped into the defendant's box. Yang stood in the middle, Lin on the right, and Zhan on the left. Zhan Liansheng wore a lake-colored silk robe. Judge Wang read out the main text of the judgment: "Yang Anren, jointly profiting directly from matters under his jurisdiction, is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for ten years. Zhan Liansheng, jointly profiting directly from matters under his jurisdiction, is sentenced to four years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for five years. Lin Fengbao is found not guilty." The judge then sat down and briefly stated the reasons for the judgment and advised that if they were not satisfied with the judgment, they could apply to the High Court for review. At this time, Lin listened quietly with his right hand supporting his chin, while Yang and Zhan remained silent and made no expression. At the end of the court session, Zhan Liansheng was ordered to be returned to custody, and Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren remained released on bail.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Reasoning for the Judgment</h3>
<p>Reasons: 1. Regarding the parts of Yang Anren and Zhan Liansheng, the policy of allocating gold directly affects the livelihood of the people and is indirectly related to the nation's lifeline. Those who perform this duty should be vigilant to achieve results. The Central Bank's handling of gold trading is exclusively under the charge of Yang Anren, the Deputy Director of the Business Bureau. After the defendant Yang Anren implemented this national policy, he paid out gold before receiving payment for it, and when allocating gold, he did not rely on vouchers and had no original documents to check. He also allowed the purchase of gold with checks, resulting in the malpractice of bounced checks, causing the national gold policy to be manipulated by speculators. The procedure cannot be said to be without error. It is verified that according to the Central Bank's practice of allocating gold, transactions concluded in the afternoon require settlement on the next day due to the suspension of exchange relations at the clearing house, as repeatedly confessed by the defendant Yang Anren in the record. Examining the Central Bank's books, the note for 2.5 billion and 335 yuan received from Tongfeng Yu Gold Firm on February 8 of this year was paid out on the same day, and this note was not exchanged or exchanged for an application, as evidenced by the annotation in the notes column of the Central Bank's account table sent to this court on June 27 of this year. Since this note was received after the closing time of the clearing house, according to the above practice, it was a transaction concluded in the afternoon and should have been settled on the next day. In early February of this year, the market price of gold soared, changing several times a day. During this period, the gold that should have been settled on the next day was advanced.</p>
<p>(Continued from the right: Zhan Shusheng, Yang Anren) It was delivered on the first day, and the transfer was delayed by one day by taking advantage of the suspension of the clearing house. It is difficult to say that this was not a collusion for self-interest. This can be seen from the report of the Ministry of Finance sent by the National Government on May 15 to investigate the Shanghai gold rush case, which stated: "It was found that although the national banks had received these notes, they had not been entered into the accounts, that is, the gold had already been paid out, but only a piece of paper was received, similar to selling gold on credit. It is also not unreasonable to worry about whether the notes are worthless. On the surface, the national banks have not provided overdrafts or loans to various banks and firms, but in fact, they have provided the convenience of capital turnover to various banks and firms." And on the same day, the inspection report of the Central Bank Audit Office and the Central Bank Supervisory Committee's inspection of the Central Bank Business Bureau's gold trading, stated: "Collection on the same day should be transferred on the same day. If the notes are deposited in the vault to offset the payment on the same day and delayed day by day, part of the funds is invisibly used by the market." The various words, etc., are even more revealing. Moreover, February 8 was the last day for the state government to allocate gold to the gold industry. According to the practice of settlement on the next day for transactions concluded in the afternoon, the next day, February 9, was a Sunday, and the 10th was a suspension of allocation and could not be settled. The defendant Yang Anren knew that the allocation to Tongfeng Yu Gold Firm had to be settled on the next day according to the regulations, and the gold that could not be settled on the next day due to the impact of the suspension of allocation was advanced to complete the procedures on the 8th. Not only did he collude with the defendant Zhan Yunsheng for self-interest, which is obvious, but also harmed the national treasury to the greatest extent. What is even more advanced is that the nature of gold is similar to currency. Once acquired, it can be profitable. Now the defendant Yang Anren, without receiving gold payment, handed over a large amount of gold to the defendant Zhan Liansheng, so that he colluded for self-interest, which is undoubtedly true.

<h3>Foreign-Owned Public Utilities: Astonishing Business Tax Amount; A Huge Revenue for the Municipal Finance Department; Request for Exemption Deemed to Lack Sufficient Grounds; Once Passed, the Three Companies Will Inevitably Raise Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Foreign-owned public utilities in this city, such as the U.S.-owned Electric Power Company, the French-owned Electric Light and Tram Company, and the U.S.-owned Telephone Company, etc., previously stated that they had signed a business agreement with the British Municipal Council and had already paid taxes, requesting exemption from business tax. This case has been repeatedly rejected by the Direct Tax Bureau and has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation, but it has remained unresolved. Since the business tax was assigned to the local government, the companies have repeatedly applied for exemption from business tax based on previous contractual relationships. They also argued that the company, etc., could not bear the additional burden after the Municipal Council passed the Public Utilities Additional Municipal Construction Donation. The U.S.-owned Telephone Company further added Article 32 of the "Sino-American Treaty" as an excuse for tax exemption. The reporter visited the persons in charge of the Finance Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau to inquire about how this case should be interpreted reasonably, as this case concerns the future tax obligations of foreign companies in China. It is said that the contracts previously signed by the various foreign companies with the Municipal Council were a kind of "remuneration" and were completely different from the business tax to be paid. As for the public utilities additional municipal construction donation, it is borne by the users, and the company is only acting as a collection agent and has no burden to bear. Therefore, there are no sufficient grounds for foreign companies to resist paying business tax.</p>
<p>Estimated Annual Payment of 24 Billion</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation, the business turnover of the U.S.-owned Electric Power Company in this city in June was 24,944,402,262 yuan, the French-owned Tram Company was 4,121,712,280 yuan, and the U.S.-owned Telephone Company was 4,462,550,612 yuan (this business turnover is calculated from the 10% additional municipal construction donation paid by each company in June, that is, the figure obtained by multiplying the donation amount by ten, which is its monthly business income). If the business tax is paid at 1.5%, the U.S.-owned Electric Power Company should pay 374,166,033 yuan per month, the French-owned Tram Company should pay 61,825,684 yuan per month, and the U.S.-owned Telephone Company should pay 66,938,259 yuan per month. The total business tax to be paid by the three companies is 502,929,976 yuan, which is 6,035,159,712 yuan per year. However, the above business turnover includes figures that have not yet been actually received. In addition, public utilities in this city have recently increased their prices several times. If we only calculate an average of four times, the annual business tax to be paid by these three public utilities will reach a huge 24 billion. Although it is a significant burden for each public utility company, it is an even larger revenue for the municipal finance department, so the municipal government is unlikely to give it up.</p>
<p>Collecting Information for Careful Research</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-American Treaty Article 7 added by the U.S.-owned Telephone Company, it stipulates: "The Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America shall, at the request of one party, or no later than six months after the cessation of hostilities with the enemy country, conduct negotiations and sign a modern, comprehensive treaty of friendship, commerce, navigation, and consular relations. This treaty will be based on modern international procedures and the principles of international law and international practice expressed in modern treaties recently concluded by the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America with other governments." However, although this treaty of commerce has been concluded, the municipal government has not yet formulated specific measures regarding the rights and obligations after the recovery of the concessions, so this case is still difficult to thoroughly resolve. The municipal government is currently searching for this information from the Valley to conduct careful research. According to general observation, once the foreign-owned companies are required to pay business tax, the company will suddenly increase its burden, and the way to solve it will inevitably be to raise prices.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Asks for Implementation of Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently sent a telegram to the government, requesting the speedy implementation of the economic reform plan and the strengthening of the supervisory agency for economic policy. It also requested the reorganization of the National Economic Committee and the invitation of representatives from industrial and commercial organizations to participate in the organization to communicate opinions, strengthen forces, and jointly save the current economic crisis.</p>

<h3>Local Autonomy Society Branch Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the China Local Autonomy Society held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Council yesterday at 4 PM. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the head of the preparatory committee, served as the chairman.

In recent years, it has made great contributions to promoting local autonomy and constitutional government work throughout China. The establishment of the Shanghai branch by Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and councilors is not only very necessary but also highly appropriate. I sincerely hope that people in Shanghai who are interested in the purpose of this branch will actively participate to facilitate its progress. The meeting resulted in the following decisions: (1) Ji Hao, Li Xuexun, and Zhang Xingmin were appointed to review the draft charter of the branch. (2) Methods for recruiting members will be sought. The recruitment group will send letters to each district office and district people's representative assembly to designate three to five people to be responsible, and the recruitment group will also contact other parties to proceed. (3) The establishment meeting will be held on August 17th. (4) The address of the society will temporarily be at the Municipal Council Building. (5) The expenses of the society will be initially advanced by the founders.</p>
<h3>Neither a Dancing Girl Nor a Judge: Young Woman Fenbai Denies Charges; Arrived in Full Dress, Breastfeeding Baby</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of young woman Zhu Huang Fenbai, who was accused of impersonating a female judge and disrupting order, was investigated for the first time yesterday by Prosecutor Fang Zheng of the District Procuratorate. Zhu was attractive and fashionably dressed, wearing a silver-gray, red-flowered silk cheongsam and white deerskin high-heeled shoes. She was holding a baby and occasionally uncovering her clothes to breastfeed. According to her testimony, she lives at No. 282, Jixiang Lane, Jinlu Middle Road. Her husband, Zhu Huaipi, is engaged in business. Her uncle, Huang Yan, previously served as the chief prosecutor in the puppet special district court. On the 28th of last month, she was invited by a friend to have tea at the Venus Dance Hall around 9 PM when she was mistaken for a county woman by dancers Zhou Jiahua, Shi Jiaping, and others, resulting in a conflict. She then took Zhou, Shi, and others to the police station. She firmly denied impersonating a judge. The court stated that it still needs to investigate whether Zhu impersonated a public official, used a false name for deception, or engaged in soliciting lawsuits. She was granted bail pending further questioning.</p>
<h3>Huang Zaiyi, Involved in Selling a Huge Sum of Gold from Taiwan, Is Remarkably Resourceful: Escaped the Net Twice, Hid in Japan Under an Assumed Name; His Brother Huang Zairong Was Captured Upon Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Huang Zaiyi (pictured), a Taiwanese man involved in the case of U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Evans embezzling 30 kilograms of "Fu" character gold coins from Taiwan (worth US$100,000), has become an international mystery, with judicial and police authorities in the United States, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Tokyo searching for him. The incident occurred shortly after the victory in the war. When our government took over Taiwan, it entrusted Lieutenant Colonel Evans, a U.S. liaison officer stationed in Taiwan, to receive approximately 60 kilograms of gold, gold coins, and gold ornaments that the Japanese had collected from the Taiwanese people over the years. Afterward, Evans handed over only 30 kilograms to our government, and the whereabouts of the remaining 30 kilograms of gold coins were unknown. At the time, our government received intelligence that Evans had smuggled the gold coins from Taiwan to Shanghai and entrusted Huang Zaiyi to sell them all in the Shanghai market. Subsequently, after a thorough investigation by our authorities, most of the gold coins were recovered from various buyers.</p>
<p>After the U.S. government was notified of the situation by our country, Evans was arrested in Los Angeles at the end of May and an investigation was initiated. The U.S. government also requested that the judicial authorities in Shanghai summon witnesses to testify in the United States. On June 6th, a formal lawsuit was filed in a California court. The most important witness in this case is Huang Zaiyi. The Shanghai District Procuratorate summoned him for questioning on March 15th, after which he was released on bail by Cheng Huazhen, the manager of Fuhua Trading Company, a friend of Huang's. Later, the Ministry of National Defense received a notice from the U.S. court requesting that Huang Zaiyi be summoned to the United States to testify, and this notice was forwarded to the Shanghai authorities. However, Huang had already disappeared at this time. Cheng was then questioned, and he was detained for a period before being released on bail of 50 million yuan, with a deadline of fifteen days to produce Huang.</p>
<p>While the District Procuratorate was investigating, it also notified Taiwan and Tokyo to investigate Huang's whereabouts. Until recently, there were no clues.</p>
<p>Our reporter, finding the incident bizarre, independently inquired about Huang's whereabouts. According to investigations: after being released on bail, Huang returned to his residence at No. 941, Nanjing West Road, packed everything, and quietly left Shanghai with his family to return to Taiwan. Later, he changed his surname and name and engaged in large-scale smuggling with his brother Huang Zairong, using small boats to transport goods between Taiwan and Japan. Due to insufficient secrecy, he was arrested once in Japan but eventually managed to escape due to his remarkable resourcefulness. After being released in Japan, his brother Huang Zairong returned to Shanghai. The Songhu Garrison Command heard about this and immediately arrested Huang Zairong, who is currently still in custody.</p>
<p>It is reported that Huang Zaiyi has once again changed his name and is secretly living in Japan. The U.S. military authorities in Tokyo are still searching for him.</p>

<h3>The Cutting Pain of a Dancing Girl: Divorce Did Not Sever the Root of Trouble</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Jin Lina (original name Du Juying, pictured), a 24-year-old dancing girl at the Da Hu Dance Hall from Changzhou, has been dancing for many years. In March of this year, she met a dance patron named Lu Shifang, 31 years old. Over time, they developed feelings for each other and became very close. Later, they participated in a group wedding organized by the Ningbo Fellow Association and officially lived together at the Longgong Hotel.</p>
<p>After the marriage, Lu had no legitimate job and was addicted to gambling. His circumstances were also not good. Before long, he gradually swindled the woman out of her savings, gold jewelry, and money, spending it all. The woman thought she had met the wrong person and that her fate was simply unfortunate. After a considerable period, the woman found her situation increasingly difficult and agreed to a divorce. On June 27th, a lawyer, Shen Hanzhang, officially handled the procedures, and she paid the man 4.3 million yuan in a lump sum, declaring a complete severance of relations.</p>
<p>After the divorce, the woman had no means of support and returned to the Da Hu Dance Hall, returning to the profession. It has been more than three months since then. However, the previous night, Lu Shifang suddenly went to call her to sit at a table. After the session, he insisted on inviting her out to eat. The woman could not refuse, so they went together. While walking on the street, Lu changed his mind again, wanting to invite her to the Eight Immortals Bridge. The woman did not suspect anything and remained vigilant, knowing that Lu's arrival must be ill-intentioned. They walked and walked until they reached Jinling Middle Road. When they reached the entrance of Jiu'an Lane, the woman took advantage of his carelessness and turned around and leaped into the Central Linji Apartment, heading straight to Room 303 upstairs, which was where her foster mother, Zhou Lu, lived. Lu saw the woman escape inside and chased after her, reaching the door, but the woman had already bolted the door. Unexpectedly, Lu was still unwilling to give up and forcefully broke the door open. He then pulled out a bottle of acid he had been carrying in his gown pocket. Zhou Lu knew that something was happening, but thinking that Lu was holding a knife or other weapon, she rushed forward to snatch it. As the two struggled, the bottle stopper came loose, and the acid began to leak out. Lu himself was the first to be splashed. Because acid is highly corrosive and immediately emits white smoke upon contact, Zhou Lu did not know what it was and thought it was a fire. She rushed out, shouting for help, and neighbors gathered, creating a chaotic scene. Jin, unable to escape, used her wits and covered her head with the bedding on the bed. Lu refused to let go and tried to pour the acid on her. After several struggles, the woman's neck and hands were slightly burned. At this point, Lu seemed dazed and rushed out the door, still scattering the bottle of acid everywhere, splashing many of the tenants who had gathered at the door. In his panic, Lu accidentally fell to the ground, causing the acid to pour over his body, resulting in serious injuries. However, after Lu struggled to his feet, he ran downstairs, still trying to escape, but he was eventually caught by several tenants working together. After reporting to the Songshan Police Station, he was sent to the Police Hospital for treatment due to the severity of his injuries. Jin Lina was treated at the Nanyang Hospital and was soon discharged.</p>
<p>Although the tragedy injured many people, fortunately, none were seriously injured. The only unfortunate death was a kitten upstairs that was burned.</p>
<h3>Yang, Zhan, et al. Defend Themselves on Three Points; The Statement of Reasons Refutes Each Point</h3>
<p>The reasons for defense specially made by the defendants are nothing more than "(1) The Central Bank's practice of accepting non-exchangeable promissory notes as payment on the same day did not begin on February 8th of this year; there are precedents that can be cited. (2) February 8th was a Saturday. The former Governor of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, only ordered the secret sale at 11:45 AM. Although the time of the secret sale exceeded 12:00 PM, it should still be considered morning before the Central Bank had lunch and is not subject to the restriction of settlement on the next day for transactions completed in the afternoon. (3) The Central Bank was ordered on the 10th to stop gold allocation to gold businesses; the defendants could not have known this on the 8th." After investigation, the court found that the Central Bank's receipt of non-exchangeable promissory notes as payment on the same day did not begin on February 8th of this year. However, its previous illegal acts have been clarified in the aforementioned report from the Ministry of Finance, etc. However, the amounts were not large, and the investigation revealed that it was due to a lack of attention and a failure to rush the exchange. This is still difficult to exempt them from criminal responsibility. On February 8th, the total number of gold bars secretly sold to Tongfengyu was 540, totaling 2.95335 billion National Currency. Among them, as much as 2.50335 billion yuan in promissory notes were not exchanged. In other words, Tongfengyu essentially purchased gold worth 2.90335 billion yuan for 450 million yuan on that day. With such a huge amount, it cannot be said that there was no collusion for profit. Who can believe it? The defendants' first point of defense is untenable.</p>
<p>Promissory Notes Cashed Out, Gold Should Be Returned</p>
<p>As for the Central Bank's so-called afternoon transaction and next-day settlement, it was purely because the afternoon transaction had passed the promissory note exchange time. The promissory note exchange stops at 2:00 PM, and all promissory notes sent to the exchange before 1:30 PM can still be exchanged. According to the testimony of defendant Yang Anren and witness Wang Songtao, even if the transaction exceeded 12:00 PM, it was not impossible to exchange. Moreover, even if it could not be exchanged, the received gold should be returned. This can be seen from the fact that on January 11th of this year, Taikangrun withdrew 90 gold bars, and because the payment promissory notes could not be cashed out on the same day, the gold was returned. Since there was a precedent for returning gold, the gold payment of over 2.5 billion yuan from Tongfengyu was settled with promissory notes, and the gold was not returned. Why was Tongfengyu treated so favorably compared to Taikang? The defendants' second point of defense is untenable.</p>
<p>Avoid Stopping Allocation, Backdate the Date</p>
<p>The government's policy of stopping gold allocation on February 10th cannot prove that the defendants knew about it on February 8th. However, the promissory notes paid by Tongfengyu were not transferred on the 8th and were only kept in the cashier's department. Moreover, the Central Bank's payment of gold did not require a requisition note, and the testimony of the aforementioned witness Wang Songtao can prove this. Therefore, after the allocation was stopped on the 10th, it was not impossible for defendant Zhan Liansheng to have the promissory notes presented to withdraw gold, pretending that they were presented on the 8th, to compensate for the loss. Moreover, the Central Bank's gold trading, except for occasional clear settlement on the same day in explicit allocation and secret sales, otherwise, secret sales all had accounts of afternoon transactions and next-day settlement. However, the secret sale on February 8th was unique in that it did not have such accounts. According to the investigation of these accounts, the secret sale on February 8th involved a total of 800 gold bars, divided into 21 transactions, all completed in the morning (i.e., before the Central Bank's lunch) and settled clearly at the time. There were no transactions in the afternoon, which is factually impossible. Moreover, the number of secret sales was to meet the needs of the market. On the morning of February 8th, when gold prices soared, there were 21 transactions, in other words, there were 21 market needs. But there was not a single transaction in the afternoon. Could it be that there was no need in the market that afternoon? Therefore, the defendant's theory that all transactions were completed in the morning is even more untenable. Combining this with the point that Tongfengyu presented promissory notes after the exchange time, it is clear that defendant Yang Anren allocated and sold 2.50335 billion yuan of gold without payment to Tongfengyu, represented by defendant Zhan Liansheng. This was clearly a transaction completed in the afternoon of February 8th and should have been settled on the 10th. To avoid the inability to settle due to the suspension of allocation on the 10th, the settlement date was backdated to compensate for the loss, which is especially obvious. The defendants' third point of defense is untenable.</p>
<p>Reduced Sentence for Those Over Sixty</p>
<p>In summary, the evidence clearly shows that defendant Yang Anren colluded with defendant Zhan Liansheng to seek illegal profits with respect to the gold affairs under his charge. He should be punished according to law. Although defendant Zhan Liansheng, representing Tongfengyu in contacting the withdrawal of gold, is not a public official but committed the crime jointly with a public official, the crime is established with the identity of a public official. According to Article 31, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 1, Paragraph 1, Second Section of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, he should be considered a joint principal offender. However, given that the defendant is over sixty years old and fell into the legal trap due to a moment of negligence, his criminal situation is not irredeemable. The sentence should be reduced accordingly, and their public rights should be deprived separately to serve as a warning. As for the Central Bank's secret sale of 1,820 gold bars to Tongjianyu on January 27th of this year, while Tongfengyu only had 820 bars in its account on that day, with the remaining 1,000 bars entered into the account on the next day, the defendants argued that the shortfall of 1,000 bars was due to the afternoon transaction and next-day settlement, which were transferred to the next day's account. After the court reviewed the Central Bank's journal account, it was found to be consistent and is included for explanation.</p>
<p>Criminal Conduct Is Unrelated to Lin</p>
<p>Regarding Lin Fengbao's part, although Lin Fengbao, as the Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, failed to prevent the collusion and fraud of defendants Yang Anren and Zhan Liansheng in advance, it is difficult to avoid the blame for negligence. This is a question of whether he should be subject to administrative punishment. As for the criminal facts, they must be determined based on evidence. The affairs of buying and selling gold were the sole responsibility of defendant Yang Anren. Moreover, after the promissory note exchange was stopped on February 8th of this year, the cashier's department received the promissory notes from Tongfengyu under the order of Yang Anren. Furthermore, the testimony of witness Wang Songtao is sufficient to show that this criminal conduct is unrelated to defendant Lin Fengbao. In addition, there is no other affirmative evidence sufficient to prove that the defendant had a common conspiracy. It is difficult to convict him simply because he was the bureau director. According to the law, he should be acquitted.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, the judgment should be made in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1, Second Section of the Special Criminal Procedure Regulations, Article 3, Paragraph 2, Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Second Section, Article 293, Paragraph 1, Article 1, Paragraph 1, Second Section of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, Article 3, Section 6, Article 13, Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 31, Paragraph 1, Article 59, Article 73, Article 64, Paragraph 2, Article 65, Paragraph 2, Article 66, First Section, Article 37, Paragraph 2, Paragraph 3, as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3>Haiqian Ship Arrives in Shanghai from Japan with Overseas Chinese; Mr. Chen Guohai's Remarks Are Worthy of Attention: Japan's Ambitions Remain Strong</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haiqian" ship, carrying overseas Chinese such as Chen Guohai and Zhang Yuxi, arrived in Shanghai at 12:30 PM yesterday and docked at the company's Second Wharf. They carried their luggage off the ship themselves and departed separately. Relevant overseas Chinese affairs agencies did not send anyone to take care of them. Last night, our reporter visited Chen Guohai at his residence, and he provided a detailed account, which is summarized as follows: "There were about 400 overseas Chinese returning home on this trip. We departed from Sasebo, Japan, on the 6th of this month and arrived in Taiwan on the 9th. About 300 Taiwanese people disembarked. Among them were 12 Japanese family members. Another Japanese family member, carrying four children, has also naturalized in our country and arrived in Shanghai with her husband yesterday. When the ship left Sasebo, the relatives and friends of these 13 Japanese family members all came to the pier to see them off, and they parted with tears."</p>
<p>Still Arrogant, Thinking They Are the Best in the World</p>
<p>"Generally, Japanese people do not admit that China won the war. They are still arrogant and think they are the best in the world. Intellectuals hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will start a war soon so that they can profit from it. Those of lower status hope that MacArthur will 'return' Taiwan and Korea to Japan. Therefore, Japanese people, both men and women, try their best to please the Americans and regard MacArthur as the second Emperor. Secondly, although the Japanese military has been disarmed, their fire brigade and police organization are extremely tight. Prime Minister Katayama announced that from July 1st, all 'overseas Chinese' in various countries must register, otherwise, they will be detained for six months if found. Currently, although Japan is extremely short of materials, due to strict control, there is no phenomenon of soaring prices like in Shanghai. From the first of this month, a personal rationing system has been implemented. To avoid black market transactions, all restaurants and food stalls across the country have been closed. 20% of our overseas Chinese in Japan were engaged in this business. Because they are good at managing, they have made huge profits, which has aroused jealousy among the Japanese. Therefore, many are planning to return home.</p>
<p>Arrogant Attitude, Hair-Raising</p>
<p>"Before we left Japan, we received a notice from the Overseas Chinese General Association that each person could bring three pieces of luggage, totaling 150 kilograms. Everyone carried a lot of purchased goods. When the ship left Sasebo, all of them were detained by the Japanese customs, resulting in huge losses. They disregard our victorious nation's international status. Their arrogant attitude is hair-raising." Finally, he said: Overseas Chinese in Japan all hope that our country will send an occupying army to Japan as soon as possible so that the lives of overseas Chinese can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>The "Grand Old Spendthrift" Looks Dejected: War Criminal Heisaburo Shibahara's Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 19th</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense tried the Japanese war criminal Heisaburo Shibahara, nicknamed "Grand Old Spendthrift." A preliminary hearing was held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, during which Military Judge Lu Qi summoned six witnesses, including Li Ziyu, Zeng Liangbing, Li Jue, Wu Dingyue, Jin Ruyun, and Gong Yueshui. The witnesses were all direct victims, and they tearfully recounted the crimes of the defendant. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, a collegiate court was convened, presided over by Chief Judge Li Liangting, to discuss the matter. The trial concluded at 5:00 PM, and the sentencing was scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 19th of this month. When Shibahara was brought to court, he was wearing a grass-green military uniform and looked dejected. The criminal is 47 years old, from Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. He lived in Northeast China as a child and is a "China expert," fluent in Chinese and the dialects of Shanghai and Hangzhou. During China's War of Resistance, he served as the intelligence director of the Japanese Army Hangzhou Special Affairs Agency, the branch chief of the Jinhua Special Affairs Agency, and the chief of the Security Section of the Ningbo Special Affairs Agency, specializing in intelligence gathering and controlling our country's materials. During the war, he also extensively recruited rogues as his henchmen to induce and coerce Chinese women, with hundreds of victims of his rape. He also repeatedly killed civilians and subjected non-military personnel to illegal torture. His heinous acts were widely known, and the people of Hangzhou and Ningbo all hated him with gnashing teeth.</p>

<h3>First Term Graduates of the China Youth Elementary Swimming Class</h3>

<h3>Impressions of the Singapore Tour (3)</h3>
<p>Looking at the results of the four games, we feel that Xingdao's skills are still higher than those of the local team. Xingdao's visit has at least given two lessons to the football world: the necessity of a coach and the importance of the forwards' shooting skills. There is no shortage of talent that can be created locally, but what is lacking is collective training and dedicated coaching talent. The local clubs are not as serious as those in Hong Kong. They do not have designated training times for their teams, so they do not pay attention to the coaches who are responsible for guiding them. In the future, if they can imitate the Hong Kong clubs and spend more money and time to train players, the future achievements may be more than this. The impressions left by Xingdao's tour of Singapore this time vary from person to person. Most sports enthusiasts regret their lack of "new blood." Players like Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, and Xu Jingcheng have been famous in the football world for more than ten years. No matter how deep their skills are, they always feel that they are old and their strength is declining, which is an inevitable trend. It is not something that human power can reverse. Considering the future of the sports world or the glory of Xingdao, they deeply hope that new people will emerge and show a new momentum. Especially since Xingdao is going to England to observe this time, young players should be given more opportunities to learn from it. The lineup this time cannot help but evoke the sadness of "Travels of Lao Ts'an."</p>
<p>Although Xingdao has failed to meet the desires of fans with a brand-new appearance here, it can get Xingdao to fully demonstrate refreshing football skills and develop noble sportsmanship at a time when the football world in this area has been repeatedly criticized for its rude behavior. This is exactly Xingdao's glorious harvest. Regarding this point, the Chinese and Western newspapers in this area have repeatedly praised it. I believe that although Xingdao cannot return in complete victory, it has returned with praise. This kind of harvest is believed to be more valuable than victory. We wish Xingdao to further develop this spirit in England and earn more fame, use a sincere heart to learn other people's skills, and wait for the return to train young people in the future.

<h3>Zhang Huanzhang and Others Hosted Figures from All Circles to Report on the Initiation of Joint Operations, Elaborating on the Characteristics and Advantages of the Joint Operating Company</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Zhang Huanzhang, Huang Yuanxin, Ye Xupan, and ten other members of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Import and Export Joint Operating Company hosted distinguished figures from all circles in the city and journalists at the Customs Club at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Huanzhang, director of the preparatory committee, delivered a speech on the spot. He first described the reasons for the decline of international trade and the motivation for the company's founding. He then elaborated on the company's organizational principles and characteristics.</p>
<p>(1) The characteristics of the Joint Operating Company are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Joint Operating Company should be an enterprise organized to break the deadlock for import and export colleagues and seek common welfare; it is by no means a trust monopolizing international trade.</p>
<p>(2) The Joint Operating Company should be an open organization that takes into account the welfare of other industries; it should not be exclusive or exclusionary. Under this premise, the demands of Chinese industry, agriculture, and vegetables should be given priority. For example, seeking outlets for the export of Chinese industrial products and agricultural products, increasing the import supply of machinery and raw materials needed for construction and sustained production, and using imported materials to attract overseas remittances and foreign deposits.</p>
<p>(3) The Joint Operating Company should assist the government in promoting economic policies and enriching the national treasury's tax revenue. In particular, it must support postwar economic construction policies and cultivate the foundation of the national economy; it is by no means seeking a separate path outside of national policy.</p>
<p>(4) The Joint Operating Company is based on assisting import and export colleagues and adopts a mutual entrustment joint operation system, so that those in the same industry who have commercial relations with the company and are engaged in exports are responsible for the risk of international market price fluctuations. On the premise of settling their foreign exchange earnings with the Joint Operating Company, impossible exports become possible, and reasonable profits are obtained. Those engaged in import can also be entrusted by the company to engage in import trade, without being threatened by domestic market price increases and decreases, making it easier to import and obtaining legal surplus.</p>
<p>(2) The advantages of the Joint Operating Company are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Under the overall planning of the Joint Operating Company, import and export trade can be appropriately adjusted. Although the foreign exchange obtained by the company can be used by the company, a special account is still opened and deposited in the Central Bank, subject to its supervision, so that a foreign exchange black market cannot be generated. Capital flight is also impossible.</p>
<p>(2) Industrial raw materials and production equipment are planned and ordered by the Joint Operating Company according to actual needs, which can reduce the import price of raw materials for manufacturers, promote increased production, and prosper industrial and agricultural enterprises.</p>
<p>(3) Finished products of domestic goods manufacturers can be developed by the Joint Operating Company in foreign markets and sold abroad as much as possible, exchanging them for the required raw materials to increase their production capacity.</p>
<p>(4) Overseas remittances and foreign deposits can be attracted by the Joint Operating Company with imported materials, avoiding evasion.</p>
<p>(5) Since the Joint Operating Company uses its own export foreign exchange earnings to operate import business, if it can be fully promoted, it will not only be unnecessary to rely on the government to supply foreign exchange, but the company can instead contribute a portion of its foreign exchange to the government.</p>
<p>(6) With the development of the Joint Operating Company's business and the prosperity of import and export trade, not only can the international balance of payments gradually become balanced, but tax revenue will increase sharply, the treasury will be enriched, and the national budget can also be balanced.</p>
<p>(3) The process of initiating the Joint Operating Company: After a long period of planning, the company convened a meeting of promoters on June 26, passed the company's initiation, articles of association, and prospectus, and appointed a preparatory committee to formally establish a preparatory office and submit a request to the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance for special permission to establish it. A first preparatory meeting was convened on July 8 to actively carry out preparatory work. It is hoped that distinguished figures from all circles, wishes, and leading opinions will not hesitate to advise and assist, so that the international trade of our country, which has a long history, can continue to develop, and the prospects of the national economy will truly depend on it. Outside the arena, the old stocks in Zhabei rose again by about half a percentage point, and the remaining stocks also rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Great Prosperity in the Shanghai Stock Market on the Weekend; Loose Monetary Policy and Active Young Factions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market met Saturday, and people were excited by the help of loose monetary policy. The young members of the securities firms were very active, aggressively pursuing No. 23, No. 89 towards Yong Yarn, No. 152 towards Dunasin and Harmony, and No. 157 vigorously attacking Mayer, all three full of vitality. Jingfu and Xingguang followed closely behind. Wuhe Weaving strived to move upstream, and the market price has already surpassed Jingfu. No outside speculative capital was seen participating, and the later market turned slightly dazed. The limit-up stocks were the immediate delivery of Yong Yarn and Matches.

However, after Sino-Russian was vigorously absorbed by No. 104, it later rose to over 4,700 yuan. People were still optimistic. Nos. 231, 89, 35, and 99 moved in again, and Nos. 231 and 89 still moved in the current Yong Yarn. As a result, the immediate delivery of Yong Yarn first rose to the limit, and the immediate delivery of Yong Yarn also rose to a new high price of 11,630 yuan. Nos. 105, 154, 8, 12, 104, and 10 closed successively. Nos. 147 and 202 unloaded the current Yong Yarn. Although Matches was raised by No. 157 to the limit-up board, the immediate delivery of Yong Yarn still fell back to 11,350 yuan. Nos. 104, 89, 177, 149, 116, and 54 moved in while it was low, and the noon collection recovered to 11,540 yuan. After the close, Nos. 54 and 89 still accepted.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw loose monetary policy. The Yangtze River gang was more healthy about eating 20-count yarn, and the goods owners were hoarding, and the market atmosphere was rising. As a result, the price of 20-count special Shuangma yarn rose to 23 million yuan, and Shuangma yarn also rose to 12 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan per step compared with the previous day. Fine yarns such as 42-count Lanfeng and Shuiyue actually rushed out of the 20 million mark, reaching 20,056,000 yuan, an increase of 780,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The remaining coarse and fine yarns such as 32-count, 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count all rose by 350,000 to 890,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was very active. The atmosphere in the market was unanimously tight due to the rise in cotton yarn. However, due to the small amount of inventory and the small amount of arrivals, prices rose again compared with the previous day. Recently, the flower prices in the producing areas have not fallen, and the merchants have no profit to see, and most of them have stopped. Therefore, before the new cotton is on the market, the source is not smooth, and the market price is also difficult to face small. The trend is always in a high market. The price of each grade for delivery to the factory was 2.2 million, 2.22 million to 2.25 million for Lingshi, and 2.07 million for Hanxi.

<h3>Cotton Cloth Overtly Firm but Covertly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market presented a situation of overt rise and covert decline. The Guangzhou cloth price was inverted with the Shanghai market, and the buying taste was sluggish. The Hankou market was similar to Shanghai, so the customer traffic was very small. In addition, the head cloth market banned the old, and there were many closings. The market had plenty of chips, so as a result, fine cloths such as Blue Chicken, Colorful Ball, and Yanghe fell by 2,000 to 45,000 yuan compared with the previous day. High-end soil forest, blue cloth, raw cloth, and bleached cloth sister city are still stable. The price of Fangjian's supply and sale of Wufu fine cloth is 420,000 yuan, and the jumping carp and agricultural machine is 455,000 yuan, which is also a stable but soft trend.</p>

<h3>Purchase Price of 35th Year Bud Tea Determined</h3>
<p>The tea purchase method determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Four Joint Offices has been determined, but the purchase price has not yet been announced. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Branch of the Four Joint Offices yesterday, the tea purchase for the 35th year has been determined to be 2.8 million yuan per box. This price gives merchants a lot of profit. After the tea merchants receive this amount, they will immediately return the deposit to the Farmers Bank.</p>
<p>Also息: In the midst of the preparations for the start of tea purchases by the China Trust Bureau, tea merchants have recently changed their sales methods again and have sold tea to foreign firm Wing Hing Yuen firm. It is heard that the transaction price is higher than that set by the China Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>Tea Market Buying Interest Not Lonely</p>
<p>Yesterday's domestic sales tea street shops and Beijing-Hangzhou roads continued to move, and the market was not lonely. The opening price continued to be high and stable. As for the foreign tea market, the sellers held on as before, so although the buying interest in the market gathered but did not disperse, they eventually searched for fish on trees, and the transaction was difficult to improve. The process became more and more difficult. The source of this year's buds was a large group, and each burden soared from 1 million yuan to 1.18 million yuan, and the rest saw light shining everywhere. According to people in the industry, the Zhen Jue green tea sold to French Africa has been booming since the Shanghai French Firm Wing Hing Yuen negotiated 900 tons with that place. The bank is accepting more and more eagerly, in order to hurry up and ship it for export.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Continue to Rise</h3>

<h3>Resuming Sino-Japanese Trade: Efforts Should Be Made to Increase Exports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Report] Mr. Tang Jiusheng, a business specialist from our country's delegation stationed in Japan, recently returned home on official business. Yesterday, he told reporters: "The entire Japanese nation is tightening its belts, hoping to restore its pre-war trade position. Among the Japanese people, it is not as if no one can live a comfortable life, but they would rather endure hardship and self-discipline, sacrificing individual comfort to 'export through hunger.' This is not mere propaganda, but a true reflection of the situation. We must be vigilant and deeply reflect on this." He further pointed out two points that the Chinese people should pay attention to in resuming Sino-Japanese trade: (1) Some merchants hope to import cheap Japanese goods to obtain huge profits. This idea is completely wrong. It should be known that trade with Japan is conducted in US dollars. Imports only deplete foreign exchange reserves, and there are very few Japanese goods of excellent quality that can be purchased today. Therefore, we should focus on striving to increase exports in trade with Japan. Some export goods that the Japanese side needs, such as medicinal materials, have not yet been noticed by us. As for our country's trade policy, it has always been unsound. It is hoped that the government will improve it as soon as possible so that export merchants can receive assistance. (2) At the beginning of the resumption of trade, the trade volume should not be too large. At this time, if powerful merchants are allowed to step in and monopolize, legitimate merchants will have no room to operate. Furthermore, the import of "prohibited items" will reduce the import of legitimate goods. He stated that the delegation has made preparations for the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade and will soon set up commercial offices. As for the issue of Japanese foreign exchange, it will also be resolved at that time. He also said that Japan has no shortage of raw materials, especially coal, iron, and food. Although its industry has not yet returned to its pre-war level, industrial recovery can be accelerated after trade resumes.</p>

<h3>Taipei in Midsummer</h3>
<p>— Taipei, 10th Telegram. Our Correspondent Jiang Muyun.</p>
<p>Taipei has now entered midsummer. During the day, the sun blazes fiercely. People walk along the covered walkways, slowly and deliberately, reflecting the characteristics of a subtropical people. In the afternoon, around three or four o'clock, a black cloud drifts in from the sea, accompanied by rumbling thunder, followed by a shower. The wind, rain, and even thunder in Taiwan are frightening. But the evening is cool and refreshing. The weather and the national character provide a good contrast.</p>
<p>Roads</p>
<p>Roads</p>
<p>are full of hawkers selling army surplus, foreign cloth, groceries, cigarettes, and coral. The police still pass by as usual. The 228 Incident has made the security authorities wary of small-scale traders. But the most timely are the ice vendors, using different sounds, tones, and methods to solicit business from passersby. The authorities have not yet considered whether this hinders sanitation or whether it should be banned.</p>
<p>From the 10th</p>
<p>From the 10th</p>
<p>, government agencies resumed afternoon office hours. What has plagued civil servants the most these past ten days is how to spend a long afternoon. After all, there are too few places in Taipei to kill time.</p>
<p>A miracle</p>
<p>A miracle</p>
<p>has occurred in Taiwan. Taipei, like Shanghai, is experiencing a serious housing shortage. Places have been occupied and lived in. Finding a storefront in the bustling city is too difficult, and finding a dilapidated house in the quiet suburbs is really difficult. As a result, "key money" similar to tickets is prevalent, with prices of two to five million being shouted out, with new tricks constantly emerging.</p>
<p>The Japanese Property Management Committee, which manages vast Japanese assets throughout the province, now has its own housing problem. The Highway Bureau, the owner of the building, wants them to move to a four-story "mezzanine," which has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Hotels</p>
<p>Hotels</p>
<p>are crowded with Shanghai businessmen. Eight or nine out of ten are doing business in railway sleepers. They know that there is not much hope, but they must try every means to get connections. Hotel room rates have risen from 100 to 500 yuan per person. Even if they are not accommodated, they still have to pay tips. Although they feel it is too expensive, they still have to endure it.</p>
<p>The official price of a railway sleeper is 550 yuan, but the Ministry stipulates a legal tender price of over 80,000 yuan, which is still profitable. As long as you can find a "permit" and obtain a "futures" contract from the Forestry Administration Bureau. Taiwan has four major forest areas, but the Railway Commission requires 800,000 sleepers, and there is not even a shadow of them yet. The trains roll on the sleepers, swaying and pressing down. The managers of each line are sending telegrams to report the emergency. They say that if something goes wrong, the staff cannot be responsible.</p>
<p>But sleepers continue to be shipped out of the port.</p>
<p>In the past</p>
<p>In the past, the Forestry Bureau had a major problem, and this hole is now being filled by the new Forestry Administration Bureau.</p>
<p>Huang Weiyan, an expert in forestry who studied in Germany, is now in prison, reportedly on suspicion of excessive logging and selling of timber. In the past, water accumulated in the deep mountains and flowed into the sea, taking three days. Now, it has been shortened to three hours. The lack of protection and planting of trees has caused suffering to the farmers in poor areas. Previously, the Japanese raised chickens for eggs, but now they raise chickens for meat, directly and simply.</p>
<p>A special investigation team from the provincial government and the courts, consisting of seven people, is preparing to conduct a comprehensive liquidation of the former Forestry Bureau's business within three weeks. The new Director Tang Banxu has proposed six plans to treat old diseases and prevent recurrence. Adjusting the official price to maintain balance with the black market and reconsidering the distribution method are among the main topics.</p>
<p>The proposal to expedite the restoration of the 450,000 KW Dahui Hydropower Plant, after a survey by personnel from the General Office of Hydropower Generation, has been revived. However, the civil engineering work, which is 70% complete, has been frequently damaged in the past year. The completed materials are openly stolen and transported away, which cannot be prevented.</p>
<p>This situation is similar to that of smuggling. The smuggled goods seized are either empty boxes or inferior goods.</p>
<p>Smuggling is a huge risk, but the waters around Taiwan are a paradise for these adventurers.</p>
<p>However, the authorities have repeatedly stated that they are determined and confident in preventing smuggling.</p>
<p>The registration of importers by the Provisional Import Control Committee unexpectedly saw over 800 applicants from the province. Merchants are waiting eagerly to see if they can be approved to operate the import business. But it seems that it will take another two or three months. It is estimated that about 80 will be approved.</p>
<p>Specialties</p>
<p>Specialties: Sugar, straw mats, bananas, watermelons. Just mentioning them makes people sigh: the prices at the place of origin are far higher than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The rationing of sugar has been heard, with a price of 100 Taiwan dollars per catty, equivalent to 6,500 legal tender. The most common straw mat costs 7,000 to 8,000. Bananas are in high demand because the Allied forces stationed in Tokyo send specialists to inspect them, with each one costing 10 Taiwan dollars. Watermelons have been absent from the market for over a month due to rain.</p>
<p>Specialties cannot be enjoyed in their place of origin.</p>
<h3>Bitter Heat in West Lake</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 6th Telegram. Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of July, West Lake has been enveloped by a strong heat wave. The sun rises as early as six o'clock in the morning, shining on everyone who is still asleep, making them feel a burning sensation and forcing them to get out of bed. Thus, "heat" exerts its power, and everyone hides in the dark corners of their houses, fanning themselves constantly. Sweat still flows without end. If there is a tree, even a small one, in front of their door, they consider it a haven from the heat. Therefore, apart from those who have essential business to attend to, few people venture out on the streets, which are so deserted that only the occasional cry of a vendor selling "golden pumpkins" can be heard. After noon, the weather becomes even hotter. The sun is truly like a fiery canopy, and the roads are boiling hot. Although water trucks constantly sprinkle water on the asphalt roads, the asphalt is about to melt.</p>
<p>The Fahrenheit thermometer rises from 88 degrees in the morning. Watching the mercury gradually climb up, 90 degrees, 92 degrees, 93 degrees... all the way to 96 degrees. The heat has increased every day since, setting a record of 98 degrees.</p>
<p>The Charm of a Young Woman</p>
<p>Under the surging heat wave, West Lake has transformed into the demeanor of a woman in her thirties. The leaves of the trees on the lake are even denser and deeper, like her flowing black hair. From dawn to dusk, the entire lake surface can be seen at a glance, no longer half-shyly obscured by a light mist. At this moment, she is not half-reluctant and gentle, but rather full of intense and passionate love. Although she is as beautiful as ever, she is heavily made up, appearing vigorous and powerful.</p>
<p>West Lake, she certainly resembles the charm of a young woman.</p>
<p>In the morning, if you take a small boat to the depths of the lotus leaves and awaken the lotus clusters in their hazy state, the lotus will gently extend its jade arms, exuding fragrance, making you wonder if you are in a world of immortals. Or, if you take a boat to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and see the lotus flowers blooming on Xiaoying Island, it is like being in a fragrant water kingdom, forgetting all the vulgarities. From then on, you can stay on this embankment surrounded by lotus flowers from morning till night, letting the wind blowing from the lake wash away the summer heat in your heart. If you drive to Jiuxi or Longjing to escape the heat wave, or climb to Yanxia Cave to spend this hot summer. West Lake, who dares to say it is not a summer resort? However, many people are busy with their lives and do not have the leisure to appreciate the gifts of nature. Therefore, they can only continue to work in relatively dark corners.</p>
<p>Moonlight over the Inns</p>
<p>Cold drink shops are lined up, with one every twenty steps. Children selling popsicles carry wooden boxes and run around in the heat, shouting at the top of their lungs. Some vendors, with their whole families, live next to the roads, big and small, living on the roads all day long. They have formed two-way families. Rickshaw pullers, carrying heavy burdens, run with their feet competing with the scalding ground. These scenes are also a picture of struggling against nature. There are also many people who are busy with the general election. They come to Hangzhou one after another, regardless of the heat and heat waves, competing under the heat and heat waves.</p>
<p>Every summer on the shores of West Lake, hotels always reach the off-season period. This year, the hotel business is still good, and prices have also risen. The best rooms in the best hotels cost 150,000 yuan a day. People who come to Hangzhou to play despite the heat have not stopped yet. Many well-known people are still playing!</p>
<p>Red Lights on the Lakefront</p>
<p>When night falls and the sun sets, the deserted streets become lively. Everyone who escaped the fiery canopy runs out of their houses to the streets. Every road and every street is filled with bamboo beds and chairs. Even the most prosperous and modern Tingling Road is no exception. Many people lie barefoot and with bare arms on these chairs, fanning themselves to cool off, and only move back into their houses late at night, around two or three o'clock.</p>
<p>The lakefront is even more lively, with people pushing and squeezing each other. Vendors selling Yongguo, soda water, and cold drinks are all concentrated in the six parks along the lakefront. The Sixth Park is full of people. The grass is full of people sitting and lying down. The Lakeside Tea House in the Sixth Park is even more crowded. People who go to drink tea later have to stand aside and wait. The boat business is booming at this time. Many people want to go out on the lake, which costs 10,000 yuan per hour, and some even bargain up to 15,000 yuan. Some people bring soda water, fruit, and musical instruments, row to the center of the lake, and play instruments or sing songs, which is very pleasant.</p>
<p>There are also many girls who specialize in singing ditties. They are on boats in the middle of the lake. When your boat approaches, someone will solicit you to hire them to sing. Singing one song costs about 5,000 yuan, or even 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>This year, all the boats have a red lantern. The twinkling red stars are spread across the dark night. Looking from the center of the lake to the lakefront, the red and green neon lights are dazzling and eye-catching. The open-air cinemas and night gardens are all competing to be beautifully decorated.</p>
<h3>The Most Economical Air Engine (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yikun</p>
<p>Utilizing Four Pistons in Four Cylinders</p>
<p>In previous hot air engines, there were two pistons installed in the same cylinder. In fact, one generates power and the other regenerates heat. After numerous studies, Philips invented a four-cylinder air engine that uses four pistons to achieve the goal of one piston per cylinder. This invention not only saves a lot of materials and engineering during manufacturing but also greatly increases the efficiency of the entire machine.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the biggest shortcomings of old-fashioned hot air engines are their large size, heavy weight, and low efficiency. According to the engine program manual printed in 1923 by a famous engine manufacturer in the world, the most advanced hot air engine at that time weighed 1,500 pounds, had a volume of approximately 25 cubic meters, and generated only two horsepower. Now, a two-horsepower Philips air engine weighs only 30 pounds (only 1/50th of the previous weight) and has a size of only 0.2 cubic meters (only 1/125th of the previous volume), while its efficiency is twice as high as before. If the Philips air engine is compared with an internal combustion engine of the same size and weight, the power and efficiency it generates are also very close.</p>
<p>Great Advantages: Fuel is Not Fixed</p>
<p>The biggest expense of any engine is fuel. According to economic principles, internal combustion engines are more economical than steam engines, and among internal combustion engines, diesel engines are more economical than gasoline engines. The Philips air engine is between a diesel engine and a gasoline engine. However, the Philips air engine has a great advantage in terms of fuel: it does not necessarily have to use a fixed fuel to start it. Diesel engines must use diesel, and gasoline engines must use gasoline. The Philips air engine can use not only diesel or gasoline but also kerosene, vegetable oil, alcohol, gas, natural gas, charcoal gas, and any other fuel that can heat air. In places where fuel supply is difficult, such as the interior of our country, the Philips air engine is the most suitable and ideal.</p>
<p>In terms of durability, diesel engines, gasoline engines, and all other internal combustion engines are not as durable as steam engines. The most vulnerable parts of an internal combustion engine are its cylinders and pistons. This is because the fuel after mixing oil and air constantly explodes and burns in the cylinder, and in fact, it is impossible to burn completely. A part of the hot oil and hot gas reacts chemically with the steel of the cylinder and piston itself before being discharged, gradually dissolving and damaging them. The cylinders and pistons of the Philips air engine are constantly in contact with only filtered hot air and nothing else. Moreover, this hot air is only compressed and expanded in the cylinder and does not explode or burn in the cylinder, so there is no possibility of it being chemically reacted and dissolved. Therefore, the Philips air engine is more durable than any other engine.</p>
<p>Internal combustion engines have a very obvious disadvantage: the exhaust gas they emit is abundant and smelly and contains a large amount of toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, as well as pollutants and soot. The Philips air engine is very clean and hygienic. The hot air it needs is heated outside the cylinder, the fuel can be completely burned, and the hot air can be filtered before being input into the cylinder. The exhaust gas discharged from the cylinder, in addition to a slight amount of hot air, has no possibility of containing toxic or odorous gases.</p>
<p>The Philips air engine does not use timed cyclic explosions to generate power like internal combustion engines, so it makes very little noise when it is running. Unlike internal combustion engines, which make a deafening noise, a 15-horsepower Philips air engine used in a car makes only as much noise as a regular household sewing machine when it is running, even without sound insulation equipment.</p>
<p>The air engine does not use explosions to generate power, so it does not need spark plugs, distributors, coils, wires, or other electrical equipment. Therefore, it will not stop due to electrical circuit problems.</p>
<p>In addition, air engines have another great advantage: they can still generate great power even when running very slowly. When using a Philips air engine in a car, not only can gears be saved in the gearbox, but the entire transmission equipment can also be eliminated. This can save a lot of engineering materials and costs in car manufacturing, and it will be extremely convenient when driving.</p>
<p>The Philips laboratory is constantly studying various principles. Often, when studying a certain problem, in order to improve, it also studies many new theories, new methods, and new things. The final results are often unexpectedly successful, creating many new things that were not originally thought of. When the air engine was first studied, it was only intended to use the principles of hot air engines to create a more economical and lightweight engine. After more than ten years of continuous research, calculation, improvement, and experimentation, many completely different new parts, new assembly methods, and new materials were completed. Finally, the most economical air engine introduced in this article was completed. Now, these Philips air engines, from 1/10 horsepower to hundreds of horsepower, in various sizes and forms, are readily available. They can be used in cars, trains, factories, homes, and any other place that needs power. European and American countries have already placed large orders and adopted them. In the near future, they should be popular throughout our country to help construction. Because it has many characteristics that are suitable for our needs, especially its fuel supply and economical durability, which are most in line with our country's ideals. It is hoped that in the future, the cost of power can be reduced as a result, and various industries and sciences can rely on it to advance rapidly. Due to space limitations, this newspaper was unable to provide a detailed description. If readers have any questions about this air engine, they can send a letter to P.O. Box 905, Shanghai Post Office, to communicate directly with me. I will do my best to answer everything I know.</p>
<h3>Diagram of New Engine Principle</h3>
<p>[Figure 1] Diagram of hot air engine:</p>
<p>The already compressed air is heated in the cylinder VW by the heater II, expands, and pushes the piston ZW to generate power. Driven by the flywheel, the piston ZW is pushed back into the cylinder after generating power. It pushes the air in VW, which has been used and is gradually cooling down but is still relatively hot, through the partition R of the heat regenerator and the cooler K, and into the heat regeneration cylinder VK. This cooled air is compressed and heated again in VK by the piston ZK under the action of the flywheel. This regenerated heat is then input into the cylinder VW through K and R to generate power again.</p>
<p>The heater H is heated by the boiler B. The cooler K is cooled by water or air. This is because if the hot air pushed out of the power cylinder is compressed again without cooling, its temperature will be too high and it will explode. Therefore, it must be cooled before the two cylinders can have a suitable temperature.</p>
<p>On the hot air engine, its two piston rods D are pinned in the center at C1 and C2. Then connect to the horizontal axis S (that is, both sides of the flywheel). On this flywheel, the piston rod of the power cylinder is installed 90 degrees in front of the piston rod of the heat regenerator, so the rotation of the power piston precedes the heat regenerator piston by 90 degrees.</p>
<p>[Figure 2] Diagram of V-type hot air engine:</p>
<p>The principle of this engine is exactly the same as that of Figure 1, but it adds a weight G to the flywheel for uniform rotation. Because this engine uses a V-type installation, it saves a few parts of the power transmission equipment compared to the one shown in Figure 1. The position of the entire machine is also slightly reduced, and the flywheel rotates evenly, so the vibration is also reduced.</p>
<p>[Figure 3] Diagram of Philips four-cylinder air engine:</p>
<p>This engine has a hot air position VW at the top of each cylinder, and a cold air position VK on the same cylinder. The hot air part VW of the first cylinder is connected to the cold air part VK of the second cylinder, with the heater H, heat regenerator R, and cooler K installed in between. The other cylinders are also installed in the same way. Each piston is connected to the same horizontal axis. The first cold piston is connected to the fourth piston Z4 at 90-degree intervals, so the first piston always moves 90 degrees before the second piston. This continues to the fourth piston, forming a 360-degree full circle rotation.</p>
<p>[Figure 4] Diagram of the oldest hot air engine:</p>
<p>This engine only has a piston Z to generate power, and P is a hot and cold air exchange piston. R is the furnace, which heats the cold air in VW, and the hot air is transmitted to VK through P, and at the same time, it is compressed by R, causing it to expand and push the piston Z. The used cold air returns to VW through VK and P, and is then heated by B, so the cycle continues and generates power.</p>
<p>[Figure 5] The first hot air engine manufactured according to the principle of Figure 4: The tall cylinder on the right is divided into upper and lower parts: the lower part is the boiler (i.e., B in Figure 4), and the upper part is the hot and cold air exchanger (i.e., VW, P, and the VK part above P in Figure 4). The small cylinder in the figure contains a piston (i.e., Z and VK below it in Figure 4). On the left of the figure is the flywheel. Other rotating equipment can be seen in the figure.</p>

<h3>Jiang Zaixi's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Xuan Chang</p>
<p>In recent art circles, many artists have emerged, with splendid talents and competing styles. Among them, there are many talented young people who are immersed in art and make courageous and diligent progress. Jiang Zaixi is one of them, as far as I know. Zaixi, with the courtesy name Jian, graduated from Suzhou Art College ten years ago, hailed as a top disciple. Even his early works amazed the elders. Since the Japanese invaders committed their rebellion, he has been confined to the sea, and has devoted himself even more intently to the Six Canons of Painting. At that time, Suzhou Art College also moved to Shanghai, and he was hired as a professor, where he taught and learned alongside his students. When he went out, he traveled with various prominent figures, and he never tired of learning. Thus, his art has greatly improved. In his painting, he initially took the Song and Yuan masters as his model, and over time, he fully understood their essence. His works often show a sense of rustic simplicity in their meticulous detail. Down to the Ming and Qing masters, he never failed to emulate them with his heart and hands. It can be said that he is able to comprehensively understand them. Therefore, in landscapes, flowers and birds, figures, and running animals, wherever his art extends, he has his own unique style. In recent years, he has loved to paint butterflies, lifelike among the flowers, with a divine and immortal appearance. For a time, he was known as "Jiang the Butterfly." I say that calligraphy and painting do not have to be rigidly bound to the past, but they must originate from the ancients. The essence lies in having the ancients within, so that every stroke has its own identity. What is called talent and learning complement each other to achieve success! Zaixi can be said to have attained this.</p>
<p>Zaixi is a fellow townsman of mine, elegant and talented, with calligraphy based on seal script. Recently, he has exhibited his best works, accumulated over time, at the Daxin Painting Hall. I use this article to promote him.</p>
<h3>Presented to Jiang Zaixi</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>I visited Yu Yi at Xuan Chang Lou, and met Jiang Jun Zaixi, who is good at painting.</p>
<p>He captured the spirit of Xu Huang, a rising talent. I was honored to receive a painting, with lively birds and plants, and a pure</p>
<p>wind within. Now Jiang Jun is exhibiting his recent works, and I offer this poem in tribute.</p>
<p>Later, you should be happy to reside at the top, I will see you again at Xuan Yang Lou, Waiting to receive a fan with treasures of Ji Style, Lively birds and plants fill the Southern Clouds!</p>
<h3>The Realism of Perception in Painting</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>I have previously discussed the trend in the modern Paris school of painting to explore visual realism. Here, I will describe the opposing trend, which emphasizes what is called "perception" (Connaissance). Generally speaking, although modern art emphasizes "reason" (Intelligence), one can still observe in painting a trend towards expressing the reality perceived through perception. We refer to this tendency within the Paris school as "realism of perception" (Realite de Connaissance).</p>
<p>The so-called perception or reason in painting refers to a form of sensibility, not the concepts of perception or reason. In other words, perception in painting is examined in situations where the center of sensibility is regarded as the center of intellect, or where that sensibility has a perceptive direction. This trend is not only present in modern art, but also to some extent in the tradition of French painting, which is undeniable. If one carefully examines the works of classical artists like J.L. David and Ingres, one can find a considerable perceptive atmosphere. This underlying traditional element can be said to be quite pronounced in modern French painting, especially in the Paris school. At the very least, the pursuit of intellectual sensibility is one of the most modern characteristics. The tendency to demand reason or perception as seen in modern painting is a trend that demands "sensibility" (Sensibilite), and this trend can be said to be unprecedented in the history of painting.</p>
<p>Taking the form of how we view objects as an example: If we view it completely according to its natural form, then it is pure naturalism. If we view it with the direction of painting in mind, with visual truth as the center, then it must be said to be visual realism. Conversely, in the direction of perception, whether it be lines or surfaces, they are detached from nature and follow the mechanism of painting, maintaining this state to construct the form of the painting. Furthermore, if one senses the material properties of an object, that will also express the perceived reality of the object. It can be handled as a mechanical sketch or as a close-up. The same can be said in the case of color. Therefore, if one extremely inclines towards the direction of perception, it becomes nothing more than a symbol, or it acquires a symbolic power. For example, Cubism, which extremely promotes the formation of composition. Many artists and schools that emerged from this are based on this perception. To give a more extreme example, there is Dadaism.</p>
<p>Although Dadaism is anarchism in painting, it is not irrational doubt or negation, but rather the raw exposure of absolute intellect and perception.</p>
<p>This tendency is most appropriately displayed by Cubism. It can be said that Cubist painting has fully surpassed visual perspective and foreshortening. If one pursues visual truth, then the so-called perspective or foreshortening becomes a problem. However, based on reason and perception, it is not difficult to get rid of them. Therefore, Cubists have tried to express the intervals of four-dimensional time or objects on a single canvas, using overlapping and juxtaposition. What Cubists perceive is neither visual pleasure of painting, nor the sentiment of painting. It is entirely respect for perception in painting, the extreme driving force of perceptive sensibility.</p>
<p>All the painters of the "Paris School" that have grown from this tendency in painting are emphasizing this so-called perceptive sensibility. For example, Surrealism, although it lacks the doubt and negation of Dadaism, can be said to be making use of perceptive sensibility, even viewing it as a kind of symbol or something symbolic. Surrealism noticeably emphasizes imagination in the process of observing objects, but in fact, it is not only about emphasizing imagination, but also about perceptually transforming the dimension of that imagination. (It is not a deformational depiction like Cubism.) Therefore, its emphasis on imagination should be the opposite of perceptive sensibility, but in fact, there is no relation. What is meant by using imagination to deform the perception of things is nothing more than promoting the realism of perception. Therefore, the spirit of Dadaism and the spirit of Surrealism in painting can both be said to be trends that explore the realism of perception in painting.</p>
<p>This trend can be seen in all painters who create based on Cubism in the modern Paris school. Whether it is George Braque (1882), Chirico (1883), or M. Gromaire, they all have this tendency in common. Among these, we can also distinguish two tendencies of perception:</p>
<p>(1) Although pursuing the truth of perception, it is realistic, that is, it should be called realistic realism of perception (Realite Realistique de Connaissance). For example, the aforementioned George Braque, Gromaire, Chirico, etc., all belong to this category.</p>
<p>(2) Although claiming to be pursuing the truth of perception, it is mechanical, possessing a mechanical tendency, that is, it should be called mechanical realism of perception (Realite Mechanique de Connaissance). Many writers with the general tendency known as Purism can be cited as examples.</p>
<h3>Inscription for Viewing Huangshan Masterpiece</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>The Creator displays divine skill, using the earth to fashion mountains. Day and night, nature rivals divine creation, conveying the sights of the world. In recent times, there were Ma Yuan and Xia Gui; in ancient times, Jing Hao and Guan Tong. Who does not emulate nature, with brilliant, dazzling carriages? Among the famous scholars of Jinan, Yu, Ma, and Ban are counted. He excels in three arts and loves traveling, experiencing countless changes. The Yellow Mountains are especially cherished, reaching the hidden peaks through arduous climbs; the eyes take in the scenery, the heart understands, and the brush captures its essence. The strange pines are especially peculiar, thirty-six in number, like beautiful women with dark eyebrows. In five days, a masterpiece is created, with the imposing force of an arrayed wall. Startling the creatures, a single brush stroke conveys the heart's pity.</p>
<h3>Viewing Yu Jianhua's Landscape Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Jianhua is a banished immortal, his talent shining brightly. Growing up near Mount Tai, he absorbed its beauty in childhood. Paintings fill his chest, inspiration always at his wrist. He tirelessly wanders great rivers and famous mountains. Since the chaos began, he has dwelt in a corner of the sea. Far from high carriages, he spends his years with a broken inkstone. His mind contains the clouds rising from the peaks, and the wild geese falling on the sandy shore. He kneads his thoughts to trace their origin, opening up his mind to explore their changes. One day, a grand spectacle arises, four walls filled with elegant appreciation. Half a thousand things delight his heart, seen in a dream of the Northern Garden. He paints a giant Yellow Mountain, piling up wonders in successive layers. From afar, one hears the roar of a tiger in the spring, and the tall pines become sights to be observed. The verdant peaks tower thousands of feet high, with a casual freedom surpassing all his peers. He only hates that the chaos has not ended, and his fleeting life has fallen into sorrow and worry. Reading the painting, let us set our minds free, discussing it together. Tomorrow, we will bring wine money, a hundred cups to toast and encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Yu Bingru's Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Liang</p>
<p>– Tune: Rume Ling –</p>
<p>Comrade Yu Bingru is holding an art exhibition at the girls' middle school located in the center of Garde Road. The pieces are dazzling and beautiful beyond compare. I would not be exaggerating to compare her to the Ming dynasty painter, Ms. Wu Juan. I offer this short verse as my congratulations.</p>
<p>Her brushwork naturally emulates creation, and her artistic conception is fascinatingly surprising.</p>
<p>See the elegance of the water and the heroism of the mountains. Such beautiful scenes are gracefully displayed by you.</p>
<p>Graceful, graceful—her elegance rivals Wu Juan's.</p>
<h3>Four Heroes Painting</h3>
<p>— Zheng Renshan</p>
<p>In the early days of victory in the thirty-fourth year, artist Zheng Renshan used a large piece of Jiangse paper to paint four British people, symbolizing the four allies, and to celebrate the victory. It is atmospheric and magnificent, and it is worth seeing. It was inscribed by Ma Gongyu. Recently, with the completion of the Capital's Jieshou Hall, Mr. Zheng generously donated it to show his respect. The meaning of the head of state. The right is a miniature of the painting. (Editor)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 341</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Besides this couple, there was also a young servant named Liu Wu, a cousin of Liu's. At this time, he was a strong and vigorous eighteen-year-old lad. Under "Zero Four," he was a well-known troublemaker who knew a few words and followed "Zero Four" to learn how to send and receive telegrams and Japanese. Unfortunately, "Zero Four's" own Japanese was not very good, and he had a stutter, so Liu Wu's Japanese not only didn't improve, but he also picked up the stutter.</p>
<p>Our group of five, posing as "Fifteen," followed the Japanese military train from Beiping smoothly to Changping. In the inn, we didn't have to cook our own meals, so I managed the communications in the inn, and sent Du Er and his wife, "Zero Four," and Liu Wu outside to find out about the local Japanese military's movements and routes of advance.</p>
<p>As soon as I installed this German-style dual-purpose generator, I connected with Beiping. Mr. W told me that half an hour after I left Beiping, he received several reports sent by Yaoqun and Hucheng two days earlier.</p>
<p>Hucheng's report was also said to have been sent from Changping. This time, the information was indeed written in his own hand, but the way it was delivered was quite novel. I don't know if it was his own idea or if he learned it from somewhere, but it had a very secretive flavor. He cut a report in half and sent it to Mr. W's headquarters with two messengers, each carrying one half.</p>
<p>The report was a total of more than a hundred words, and it took Mr. W more than an hour to understand the general idea, which was even more difficult than deciphering a complex code. According to the report, he had found Yaoqun's whereabouts, although they had not met. Also, the people from the Northeast Village, for some reason, did not gather in Zhangbei as planned, but instead ran to Changping and were captured by the Japanese.</p>
<p>The report also said, "Little Tiger expects to see Yaoqun within a day or two."</p>
<p>Regarding Yaoqun's report, Mr. W said he received two items: one was a telegram, using a simple coded language, which was very brief, only mentioning that the work was complicated and that Tiger Chen had misunderstood, leading to inconsistent actions. The other was a postcard, also in coded language, explaining that the work in Tianjin could not be finished and could only be temporarily left alone, hoping that headquarters would send someone to handle it quickly. She herself had already set out to the designated location to contact her subordinates.</p>
<p>According to Mr. W's opinion, Yaoqun's so-called "Tianjin work" probably did not only refer to strengthening the secret organization, but may also have included other temporary events. The numbers marked on this telegram and postcard were not consecutive, so there were probably two or three reports in between that were not delivered or were lost. Mr. W also speculated that Yaoqun was currently lingering in the Jingping area.</p>
<p>After I finished talking with Mr. W, I was busy sending out two secret messages, (1) to Panyang, and (2) to Tokyo, both inquiring about Tsurumi's whereabouts, reporting my current location, and specifying the time and wavelength for sending and receiving reports.</p>
<h3>Daqian and Jianhua</h3>
<p>— Fei Su</p>
<p>Yu Jianhua and Zhang Daqian are old friends of twenty years. In the winter of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Daqian brothers and Shanzi exhibited their collection of Ming and Qing paintings and calligraphy in the Dafengtang on Ximen Road. Jianhua braved the snow to see it, circling, sitting, and lying down, unwilling to leave. They then became friends. At that time, Jianhua taught at Xinhua Art Academy, and their residences were not far apart, so they often visited each other, and Jianhua often ate at Daqian's house. Jianhua did not like spicy food, but Daqian was from Sichuan, and every dish was spicy. Jianhua closed his eyes and forced it down, and his sweat dripped down. In the spring of the seventeenth year, the Daqian brothers initiated, inviting Huang Binhong, Chen Gangshu, Xiong Songquan, Ma Qizhou, Cai Yimin, Yu Jianhua, and other eight people to meet at Songyin Cottage to form the Lanman Society. Because Binhong was old and highly respected, they jointly elected him as president. Daqian was the youngest, and Jianhua was two years older than Daqian. At the beginning of the Lanman Society, there were various plans, and a volume of Lanman cartoon collections was published. Later, due to personnel changes, the society's affairs could not be carried out. In the past twenty years, Gangshu, Qizhou, Yimin, and Shanzi have passed away one after another. Only half of them remain today. Binhong, at the age of eighty, is traveling to Beiping. Songquan is in Shanghai. Jianhua has just returned from Fujian, and Daqian has returned from a tired tour of Dunhuang. Meeting and talking about the past, it is like a dream.</p>
<p>Each of the eight members of the society had their own expertise. Binhong's landscapes went in and out of the Song and Yuan Dynasties and had a unique appearance. Gangshu's flowers were refined and beautiful, between Bai Yang and Xin Luo. Qizhou was good at everything and liked to write Northern School landscapes. Yimin painted bamboo with the style of Huzhou. Songquan liked to paint animals, especially lions. Although Shanzi was good at landscapes and figures, his paintings of tigers were the most sought after, so at that time, "Xiong's Feet" and "Zhang's Tiger" became their nicknames. At that time, Daqian was fascinated by Shitao and Bada. Jianhua was originally good at landscapes, but he was not known as a family. Shanzi said that for three hundred years, there has been no successor to Bancan, and he often persuaded Jianhua to devote himself to this tradition. Jianhua, with the majestic and bold spirit of Qi and Lu, studied thick and dense paintings, hitting it off immediately, and soon he could even confuse the real with the fake. Jianhua engraved a seal that said "Half of Bancan," which was actually a humble saying.</p>
<p>In the summer of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, Daqian and Jianhua agreed to cross the East China Sea to Japan and take in the beauty of Mount Fuji, Hakone, and Atami. Jianhua also held an art exhibition in Osaka, which was highly praised by the art world there. Since then, Jianhua has believed that learning from nature is better than learning from the ancients. He traveled to famous mountains and rivers in the southeast, "exhausting the wonders of the peaks to draft his ideas." He returned and compared his impressions with the works of ancient masters, and he was even more convinced that what he saw was correct. Daqian wrote in his travelogue of Yandang Mountain:</p>
<p>"I heard of the beauty of Yandang Mountain a long time ago, but I haven't been able to travel there for ten years. The scenery of Longqiu north and south, I often seek in my dreams. Yu Zi has a clear interest, and his feet are strong when climbing mountains. Thousands of peaks support the bottom of my eyes, and each one is collected at the end of his brush. I can't get tired of seeing it hundreds of times, and I pity that my wish has just been fulfilled. If I were to raise Ershi, I would clap my hands in praise."</p>
<p>He also said: "After returning from Yandang, he showed me several things in a small booklet. The scenery is strange and precipitous, which is naturally created by nature, and the wonderful use of the brush is derived from Shixi and Shitao. I wrote a few vulgar sentences to make you laugh. Daqian Zhang Yuan."</p>
<p>In the past ten years, Daqian has been immersed in art and has a well-established reputation in the world. Jianhua traveled and painted, his scope of knowledge increased day by day, and his skills improved. Moreover, Jianhua had studied Western painting, so he was especially able to capture the likeness in his sketches. The Yellow Mountain and Baiyue Mountain, Mount Wuyi, and Yandang Mountain that he wrote, those who have traveled to the places, can recognize them at first sight. And the use of brushes, the layout, and the coloring are all in line with ancient methods, but they do not fall into the clichés of the ancients. There is neither the habit of the new school, nor the disadvantages of copying. Is it not Jianhua who is referred to when we say "learning from nature externally and obtaining the source of the heart internally"? Now Jianhua will show his works for the public to enjoy. Daqian happened to return to Chengdu for business and was unable to attend the event in person. Now, I will describe the relationship between the two as an introduction for the viewers.</p>
<h3>A Record of the "Awakening" Tea Party</h3>
<p>— Su Honglie</p>
<p>With the enthusiasm of a young person, I dashed onto the main street, already under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I also feel deeply apologetic. Since the "Awakening Society" of the Republican Daily was initiated and organized by Mr. Xu Weinan last year, I can say that I have not contributed my due effort, nor have I sent them a piece of writing that they were expecting. But thanks to the care of the host for the fellow members, I was very happy to receive an invitation recently in the midst of his busy schedule.</p>
<p>Holding it, with a hesitant and apprehensive heart, I followed the address. Since Tanggu Road is not very long, it was easy to find the "Literary Retreat" on Xiangguan Road Lane.</p>
<p>Most of the people present were young, including Right, Mao Ling, and Miss Zhu Qianping, who were all young writers who often contributed to the Republican Daily.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Weinan spoke at the meeting about his expectations for the "Awakening Society" in the future, with many words of encouragement. After the meeting, there were also some entertainment items.</p>
<p>Young people all want to have an interesting life, and I hope that this kind of organization can always emit its brilliance and warmth, so that a group of young people who love literature and art can always have the opportunity to meet and gather.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhuzhuang Invites Me to View the Huangshan Masterpiece</h3>
<p>— Song Daren</p>
<p>Huangshan has its own unique world, and writing it into a painting brings about various special effects. If you do not know the true face of it, even the beautiful clouds and pines will be blurred.</p>
<p>Jianhua has traveled all over the world, and the four paintings create a magnificent sight. The towering peaks are vertical and horizontal, and the clouds are changing and disappearing. How can a painted screen encompass the view of a hundred visits?</p>
<p>The peaks of the Literature Academy and Tiandu are wonderfully created by nature, and the pine peaks show their heroic posture. Like writing with a rubber pencil, it is like a fairyland, which is not allowed to be known by ordinary art history scholars.</p>
<p>I am searching for the strange and unrestrained advances, and I am seeking them in this painting first. For no reason, it seems that I hear the mountain spirit laughing, laughing at me for suspecting that I am pregnant with Suo Qiu.</p>
<h3>Viewing the Huangshan Masterpiece, Following the Poetic Intent of the Old Dan, with Ideas Not Fully Expressed, I Used the Original Sentence to Continue It</h3>
<p>— Tao An</p>
<p>I have been to the foot of Huangshan, but I have not climbed the peak of Tiandu. Now, viewing Jianhua's spirit, I begin to believe that it enters into the art of creation. Thousands of peaks compete to show their beauty, and ten thousand peaks pierce the sky. Swords and halberds are arranged in a dense array, and strange rocks squat like tigers and bears. The rugged bird path leads upwards, and winding dragons hang on the crooked pines. The painter imitates nature, and Yu Zi is now called a hero. Both feet tread Mount Tai, and one hand climbs Mount Hua Song. He has traveled all over the famous mountains, and his waist is strong without needing a staff. He returns and competes to wield his brush, and his strokes are as if with the wind. Clouds and smoke change with him, and the mounds and ravines are born in his chest. The two hundred li of Huangshan are all collected in one painting. Cutting off the Yellow King's fetters, he strikes directly at the palace of Dong Yuan and Ju Ran. Ashamed of my inferior brush and ink, I try hard to catch up with his height. Viewing the painting, I sigh three times, and the war drums are rumbling.</p>
<p>I have not seen Jianhua for thirty years, and when we meet on the sea, his hair is mottled. His good son's talent is outstanding, and his brush has a bold and unrestrained artistic conception. I heard that he went alone to Tiantai Mountain. When will we go to the Dragon Cave together? In the Songjiang small abode, we drink wine from the same cup, and I already feel that the poetic spirit has arrived in Yuchuan.</p>
<h3>The Truth About "Flying Saucers"</h3>
<p>— Haifeng</p>
<p>Since July 5th, it is said that a kind of fast-moving "flying saucer" has been spotted in the sky in various places. The shape and size of the "flying saucer" and the way it changes shape during flight are inconsistent. A Mrs. Ferson said that the "flying saucer" was like a circular washbasin, with five gaps, and was so large that after falling from the sky, it disappeared without a trace. A university student said that the "flying saucer" was shaped like a pie, with a blue glow. But a pilot said that it looked like a gray clam shell airplane, and the head had a mesh-like top, about fifteen feet in diameter and four feet thick.</p>
<p>And an artist who makes advertisements even called President Truman. He said that the "flying saucers" flying all over the sky are just one of the guided weapons, but because they temporarily lost control, they flew to various places.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it can be known that the various parts of the United States have been in an uproar over this mysterious "flying saucer."</p>
<p>What exactly is the "flying saucer?"</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what some scientists have to say to see what their correct opinions are on the scientific team of the so-called "flying saucer" like a "rocket":</p>
<p>(1) Admiral Brandi, who hosted the Bikini atomic bomb test, and others, do not believe in the existence of "flying saucers."</p>
<p>(2) Wright, the inventor of the airplane, said it more bluntly. He said, "This matter is just a kind of propaganda to support the State Department's current movement, 'to make us involved in another vortex of war, so that people are alarmed at each other, thinking that foreign countries are taking action against us.'"</p>
<p>(3) Another professor of physics at the University of Sydney, Dr. Gordon, used visual evidence to prove the unreliability of "flying saucers." Gordon ordered all students to stare intently at the horizon, and twenty-two students claimed to have seen "flying saucers." Dr. Gordon explained that this was an optical illusion.</p>
<p>(4) The authoritative scientist Einstein expressed even more indifference to this. He only said, "I have absolutely no opinion to express."</p>
<p>As of July 8, the military or scientific community had not made a definite conclusion on the widely rumored "flying saucers." At most, it could only be said to be a most ordinary "weather sounding instrument," as Brigadier General Lee May called it.</p>
<p>Why are Americans making such a "big fuss?" We believe that "flying saucer" should not be a scientific term. It is just that people are afraid of being threatened by war, so that in optical illusions, in a fragile psychological state, they see the phantom of this new weapon.</p>
<p>Or it is just like the "rockets" that were rumored to be discovered over Sweden last October, so some people said that they were controlled by the Soviet Union's Duro.</p>
<p>Now the whole world is very nervous. This illusionary "flying saucer" may be enough to show that humans are suffering from extremely serious neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>There was a worker in a steel factory who once argued with many other workers. Those other workers not only defeated him in their arguments but also threw him into a small river. When the worker crawled out of the river, he was covered in sewage and mud. Just then, the factory director walked by and asked him what he planned to do about those other workers in the future. He replied, "Just laugh it off with everyone!"</p>
<p>Professor Fairbrother also wrote something like this, "When people hate you, there is no need to be angry and feel pain. You might as well think it's very interesting; because you yourself have honestly done your best, let people do what they want."</p>
<p>Lincoln, the former President of the United States, was indeed able to do this. Once, General John Palmer came to Lincoln indignantly and said, "If anyone had told me that in this critical time of survival, the people would actually choose an unknown, ordinary lawyer from an unknown, ordinary small town to be the President, I would never have believed it." At this moment, Lincoln, sitting in the barber's chair, pushed the barber away with a strong arm, turned the chair around, patted the general's knee and said, "Like you, I simply don't believe it either!" So, John Palmer could find no reason to be indignant.</p>
<p>The tension of the American Civil War, the North-South war, could have caused Lincoln to die from worry and stimulation. However, Lincoln often read jokes and humorous stories before going to bed, and often told his favorite jokes in conversation to harmonize the tense atmosphere in the White House. The famous Emancipation Proclamation, at the meeting on the day it was announced, Lincoln still began his speech with a joke.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, if you are on the verge of bankruptcy, or if you are facing the terminal illness of stomach cancer, in such a miserable situation, it is simply impossible to laugh. Also, I am not saying that every time we are thrown into the river, we just laugh it off every time, but often, there are many times when we are the ones who bring it upon ourselves and deserve it, so we might as well do it ourselves and bear it ourselves.</p>
<p>Even more often, we are hated by others out of jealousy, or others deliberately slander us in words – and for things like this, we can only laugh it off!</p>
<p>New York's famous broadcaster, James Taylor, often receives thousands and thousands of letters praising him, but he also occasionally receives a few letters attacking him. Does he get angry because of this? No, he thinks those letters are very interesting, and he even reads the letters that scold him on the radio. He especially liked a letter</p>
<p>A woman sent him a letter scolding him as "a speaker, a traitor, a viper, and a stupid log." Mr. Taylor calmly said, "That lady may be joking and flirting with me." A few days later, Mr. Taylor publicly read that letter that scolded him to the point of being completely devastated in front of millions of listeners again – because he received another letter from that lady saying that her opinion was still unchanged at all. Mr. Taylor said:</p>
<p>"So, I am still a speaker, a traitor, a viper, and, alas, God knows! I am still a stupid log!" So, as we laughed along with Mr. Taylor, we admired his calmness, his wonderful handling, and his sense of humor.</p>
<p>Among all the presidents of the United States, very few have been subjected to such severe attacks as the late President Franklin Roosevelt, but during his many years in office, it can truly be said that he never scolded loudly or got angry. How do I know? Everyone who lived with him in the White House for a long time will tell you that this is true.</p>
<p>Roosevelt received many malicious letters attacking him – letters that were simply unreadable, letters that would make anyone burst into a rage after reading them. Often, those letters even had insulting words or cartoons painted on the envelopes. When President Roosevelt received those letters, he just laughed. He kept those envelopes, put them together, and gave them a title called "Bouquets and Brickbats" (the original meaning is fragrance and weapons). After President Roosevelt passed away, those envelopes, along with his famous stamp collection, were auctioned off. You may not believe it, but unexpectedly, those fifty-two envelopes filled with insults were auctioned off for a high price of five hundred and five yuan in cash. Ah, this is the truth!</p>
<p>Alas, the affairs of the world are like floating clouds, why should we bother ourselves with so many things? We might as well laugh it off!</p>
<h3>Three Old Masters of Storytelling with Drums</h3>
<p>— Drummer</p>
<p>Northerners like to listen to storytelling. In addition to listening to operas, what can satisfy the enjoyment of the senses is the variety show ground. Among the variety shows, there are many types of magic tricks, etc. The most important is storytelling with a big drum. There are also many types of storytelling with a big drum. The three main ones are: Cuixian Octagonal Drum, Meihua Big Drum, and Jingyun Big Drum. As the saying goes, every profession produces its best. These three types of big drum storytelling have produced three masters, namely Rong Jianyun, Jin Wanchang, and Liu Baoquan. Let's talk about Jin Wanchang first.</p>
<p>Jin Wanchang sings Meihua Big Drum. In literary terms, most of the lyrics of Meihua Big Drum are about romantic feelings, such as Baoyu's illness, Daiyu burning the manuscript, and Wang Erjie thinking of her husband, which is similar to Liu Yong's lyrics that require young women of eighteen.</p>
<p>Some people say that Jin Wanchang has a good voice and sufficient capital, but in fact, his drum skills are superb. No matter what kind of tune, all kinds of stringed instruments, under his drumbeat command, suddenly sound like golden spears and iron horses, suddenly like melancholic weeping, suddenly like a storm, suddenly like a glimmer of hope in the dark. There is nothing that is not melodious and free, high and low as desired. We laymen listen and only feel that the changes are infinite, and experts unanimously praise it, saying that no one can match him. In addition, his voice is broad and bright, able to thoroughly depict the feelings of men and women, sending every word into people's eardrums and stirring every sentence in people's hearts. Isn't he considered the best of Meihua Big Drum?</p>
<p>Let's talk about Rong Jianyun. He sings Shanxian Octagonal Drum. This type of big drum is called Zidishu. It was originally composed by learned people in the Eight Banners for their friends to sing for fun. Especially various pen tunes, such as Wind and Rain Returning Boat, etc., some are about love, some are about grievances, and some satirize society. They are diverse and very similar to short note novels, with extremely beautiful language and deep meaning. Before singing the main song, they must use the pen tune to arouse interest, which is a bit like the introduction recited in a big opera and the opening poem, and also like the poems and lyrics at the beginning of the main text in a novel. The main song sings stories from Shuihu, Liaozhai, and other notes. Such as Song Jiang killing his wife, Yang Xiong getting drunk, Shui Mang Capture, She Xiaoxue, Zhuo Erniang persuading her husband, etc., are what he often sings and plays.</p>
<p>Rong Jianyun can really take the original text from the book, explain it in detail in clear Beijing dialect, and explain it very clearly. He can even explain the implied meaning of the original text, not letting go of a single word. Because he has deep knowledge, a broad mind, and researches it while tapping on the red ivory clappers and singing softly. The drum in his hand corresponds to the rhythm of the Shanxian. It is not pedantic or trivial. There is an unspeakable beauty. Even the most literate people cannot help but applaud and cheer after listening to it. Thinking about it, if they were to go on stage to play and sing, they would definitely not be able to reach this level, and they would definitely not be able to achieve such results. In the Tianjin area, there are also young girls who sing this type of big drum, claiming to be passed down by someone, but they are clueless and only know how to be silly, which is not suitable for refined tastes. Those who appreciate her, unless their intention is not in the wine. Even He Zhichen, who often sings Tianjin drums, is also a famous Shanxian performer, but his knowledge and research are not as good as Jianyun, so he inevitably has a bit of vulgarity. Among them, Xie Ruizhi can be said to be both humorous in his singing and speaking, which is the trendy literary humor that is most popular in Tianjin. If Jianyun's big drum is compared to writing Huang Ting initially, which is just right, it cannot be said to be on par. There is a saying in the south, "A master is born every three years, but a great face is not born in thirty years." I say that Jianyun is the top scholar of the Octagonal Drum. It cannot be said to be an overstatement, right? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>News Clippings</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Xiaozhu</p>
<p>·Pigs are Fat, People are Thin·</p>
<p>The warden of the Jian'ou detention center in Fujian also runs a livestock business, owning seven white goats and thirteen pigs at home. Because the livestock have a huge appetite and the current grain prices are expensive, he simply detains the prisoners in the detention center and takes their food back to feed the pigs. The prisoners in the prison are miserable, but the warden's pigs are getting fatter and fatter.</p>
<p>·Waste Utilization·</p>
<p>The Suzhou Silk Weaving Volunteer Police Force</p>
<p>Regulations: Monks, nuns, and Taoists who are selected as qualified will all be appointed as volunteer police.</p>
<p>·Exquisite Article· A close aide to a female staff member issued an order, the original text of which reads: "General Decree No. 32. (The original text was not simplified.) Men and women are different, and their physiology is different. Women are endowed with menstruation, which has a regular order. The tide moistens the embankment and requires implements. Hygiene requires cotton wool. It has been found that female staff members of various bureaus and departments of this prefecture often use manuscript paper instead of cotton during menstruation. This is unhygienic and wasteful. Public affairs are limited and cannot bear this significant consumption. Therefore, a corresponding notice is hereby issued, hoping that the female colleagues under your jurisdiction will be informed to stop it immediately for the sake of public interest!"</p>
<h3>Returning Home Like a Spring Dream</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>A Faded "Spring Dream"</p>
<p>A village girl, because of her vanity, abandons her lover and marries a rich young master, but later she deeply regrets it. But youth is no more, and she finally dies in resentment – such a theme, strictly speaking, belongs to those "Saturday School" works. At the same time, in this script, you simply cannot smell a hint of the atmosphere of the times, only old, faded stories.</p>
<p>The screenwriter and director Zhu Shilin, from "Those Suffering from the Same Illness do not Sympathize with Each Other," "Each Has Its Own Merits," to this time's "Spring Dream," still has not jumped over his old ideas. He wants everyone to be at peace with reality, even if it is wrong, they should endure, endure, and endure a third time. – As a weapon (film) of the education of an era, we cannot but point this out.</p>
<p>Hu Die's performance as an eighteen-year-old girl looks extremely uncomfortable. Her performance in middle age is still steady, but here, Hu Die gives the impression of being old after all. Chen Juanjuan's Xiaofeng is still good, while Bai Chen is too exaggerated. Shu Shi's Ding Qichang has rich acting skills.</p>
<p>Satirical "Homecoming Diary"</p>
<p>Victory has been won, and many people have beautiful illusions about returning home, but how many people have had their beautiful dreams of returning home shattered in the face of reality? The experiences of a young couple in the play after returning to Shanghai after demobilization precisely illustrate that ugly side. The screenwriter and director Yuan Jun has captured a realistic theme to elaborate on, which is also worth introducing. However, in the writing of the script, the insertion of many characters and the development of the story seem stiff. And the play also obviously shows traces of being cut and deleted, so it feels discontinuous to watch.</p>
<p>The director's handling of the play failed to grasp the main theme. In the tense and chaotic scenes, there was a lack of appropriate rhythm, and the use of the camera also lacked flexibility and innovation. Perhaps the director still lacks skilled experience in film technology.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Bai Yang is the best, followed by Lü En, Geng Yun is a bit stiff, and Yang Hua is very fiery.</p>
<p>Technically, photography, recording, and set design are all below par.</p>
<p>Lighthearted Comedy "Stranger Couple"</p>
<p>The theme of "Stranger Couple" is enough to make people feel relaxed and interesting. The development of the story in the film is also arranged quite reasonably. It is probably a morale-boosting film made during the war. The director's handling of the play has no originality, and the results are only mediocre.</p>
<p>Human-like "National Velvet"</p>
<p>This is a good film that is worth introducing. Whether it is the screenwriter, director, actors, or photographer, none of them are below standard. In particular, the story is full of humanity, making you develop infinite love for it.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, the story is extremely simple, depicting trivial matters in a family, but it makes you feel intimate and delicate. The director is Clarence Brown, the director of "The Human Comedy." He brings you excellent results just like "The Human Comedy."</p>
<p>Although Mickey Rooney has an excellent performance in this film, we want to recommend the young star Elizabeth Taylor, who plays Velvet. Her vivid, delicate, and natural acting skills, superb and pure emotions, make you feel her cuteness. In addition, Jackie Jenkins is also a lovely little fellow.</p>
<p>Biographical Film "Magnificent Doll"</p>
<p>"Magnificent Doll" depicts a period of love history between the US Secretary of State Jefferson and his political enemy Aaron around the election of US President Jefferson at the end of the eighteenth century, reflecting the American people's choice between freedom and dictatorship. Although this is "American" freedom, the author's sense of justice is still commendable.</p>
<p>Ginger Rogers has an extremely excellent performance. Although not much attention should be paid to her alone, David Niven's Aaron is too frivolous and lacks the demeanor of a statesman.</p>
<p>The great director Frank Borzage only completed a simple task in this film.</p>
