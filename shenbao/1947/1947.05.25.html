<h3>參會截止收受提案　昨日德取農林軍交報告　林蔚出席說明軍事情形</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕參政會第七次會議，廿四日上午舉行，由農林部部長左舜生出席報吿農林部施政概況，此爲參加施政報吿中靑年黨部長之第一人。參政員均極表關切，計出席參政員一九四人，江庸主席，秘書處例行報告後，左氏自九時半開始報吿，至十時一刻止，歷時三刻鐘，內容避重就輕，頗得好評。報吿舉秘書處宣讀書面詢問五件，繼進行口頭詢問，共十五件，末由左氏逐項答覆，至十二時主席宣布散會。（左氏報吿見第二版）</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕參會第八次會，廿四日下午三時一刻舉行，江庸主席，出席參政員一九七人，首由主席報吿提案，請於廿四日晚八時前交到，繼聽取國防部林次長蔚軍事報吿，林氏分復員整軍及國防建設兩部，詳加分析，對當前軍事情況，亦有詳盡報道，報吿畢，各參政員提出書面及口頭詢問四十三件，大部集中軍事現況，軍風紀及兵役等問題，由林氏簡略答覆，至六時廿分許休息廿分後復會，由交長俞大維報吿，俞氏首就參會上次大會決議有關交通各案之執行情形，分別說明，其次分別說明鐵路，公路，航空，電信，郵政之改淮現況，歷時廿七分鐘，旋進行書面質詢，共廿五件，宣讀完畢，業已七時四十分，主席即時宣布散會，定廿五日上午九時繼續口頭質詢及俞交長之答覆。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕參會開會情形紫張，星期日上午決不休息，第九次會議定廿五日上午九時舉行，除由俞大維答覆參員對交部之詢問外，並由教長朱家驊作教育報吿，下午休會。四時政院茶會招待，七時由大會招待電影。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕參政會廿四日下午八時止，已停止收受提案，秘害處現已收到提案四百五十件，以經濟，財政提案爲最多。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕楊不平，何基鴻，張其朐，顧頡剛，王普涵等七十餘參政員，廿四日向大會提出臨時動議，請蔣主席出席臨時會一次，俾便躬親聽取參政員之陳述。該動議稱：「各參政員懇切陳詞，俱爲一語一淚，惜乎最高當局未能親聞，於國事殊鮮補益，用特審慎建議主席團，請用大會名義，謂蔣主席定期出席臨時大會一次，俾各參政員有一陳述之機會，藉明各地之眞相，是否有當，敬請公決」。惟此案廿四日尚未及提出討論。</p>
<h3>共軍分布狀況　八十萬人分成三部份　圖利用流竄擴充實力</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國防部次長林蔚，廿四日午後出席參會戰吿時，指出長春外圍現有激戰，然共軍包團太原企圖，由於糧糧原因，恐將放棄。魯境目前無激戰，共軍無力爭奪據點，僅能伺機出襲。陝北方面，最近無甚軍事行動，林氏說明共軍企圖在利用流竄制式，擴充實力。就軍力分布狀況而言，共軍總數共八十一萬二千人，在東北者共廿九萬人，由林彪指揮，以佳木斯爲大本營。在山東者其華東野戰軍共有兵刀十九萬人，由陳毅指揮。冀，豫，晉共軍十五萬二千人，由劉伯誠指揮。晉，冀，察共軍九萬五千八，歸聶榮臻統率。晉北及晉西北共軍三萬五午人，指揮者爲賀龍。陝，甘，寗共軍約五萬人。此八十餘萬共軍，約可分成三大部份，林彪指揮下之東北民主聯軍，獨立作戰。魯境共軍由陳毅指揮，其他聶榮臻，陳慶及賀龍之部屬，則由朱德指揮。就目前戰況言，東北共軍今年以來曾四次渡松花江來犯，最近又第五次進攻，戰事激烈。長春方面，來犯共軍共九萬人，該地外園激戰中。永吉方面，共軍亦出動四萬人進犯。此外，梅河口附近亦有五萬共軍，共軍以前迭攻據點，皆遭失敗，現乃以進攻交通續爲主。就整個東北戰局言，永吉，梅河口方面爲牽制，重心仍在瀋陽綫，該地將有激戰。山東方面，自津浦路中段打通後，陳毅與劉伯誠間即無法聯繫，陳毅殘部現轉入魯中山區，魯境現無激戰。共軍無力爭據點，僅能伺機出襲。晉陝方面，聶榮臻部圍石家莊不成，本月初以其四萬兵力向晉東進犯，圖與晉北，晉南共軍會師，共窺太原，然目前恐已放棄其包圍太原企圖。陝北延安克復後，一部共軍竄向晉西北，惟該地最近無甚戰事。</p>
<p>林氏報吿中，對軍政部份亦有詳細說明，關於部隊整編，軍事三人小組所擬定之整編統編方案規定第一期十二個月內，將二四二師整編爲九十師，第二期於六個月內，再由九十師縮爲五十師。國畢方面自去歲三月開始，至同年七月四個月中，已將五十七個軍編爲五十七個師，並由二四二師縮爲一五四師，人員由三百九十萬人減爲三百萬人，然共軍並未縮編，反而盡量擴充，不斷攻擊國軍。政府爲安全計，自去歲七月後，整編工作不能不暫時停止，至今年一月，當局爲充實部隊，樽節軍費，根據「充實前方緊縮後方」原則，再度整編。軍事人員逐漸減至二百八十萬，部隊亦由一五四師減至一三八師，惟此點不致影響部隊。此外，空軍方面保特十六萬人，海軍方面保持三萬人，此皆因限於國力，故未能予以擴充。</p>
<p>關於復員官兵處置，林民舉出具體數字報吿，在今年四月止，已予留用者四七四八〇人，待辦者一〇九八五人，已轉業者四六五五零人，待辦者一九四八二人，已退役者六五四零二人，待辦者五三一二二人。官兵待遇調整，自去年七月以來，共經三次調整，上將待遇已自十五萬增至五十萬，中將待遇已自十一萬增至四十五萬，上等兵由一萬元增至二萬五千，一等兵由八千增至二萬，二等兵由六千增至一萬五千，惟仍跟不上物價，五月起將作第四次調整。</p>
<p>軍事建設方面，一年來最重要措施，爲取消軍委會，改組成國防部，軍事教育亦極鬣視，今後將本旣定方針繼續努力，以求貫澈。</p>
<h3>改革幣制提案</h3>
<p>尹述賢等提交參政會</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕參政員尹述賢等，對於改革幣制之提案，業於廿四日送交大會，據尹氏稱：提案內容在主張改金本位制，並必須有百分之五十準備金，獨立發行，並確定與金鎊及美元之比價，至法幣仍然存在，惟改作輔幣。據尹氏稱：該案待研究討論者甚多，目前尚不能全部公布。</p>
<h3>參政員質詢軍事　盼早日結束戰局　對編餘軍官應適當安置</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕各參政員廿四日午後軍事質詢，對當前戰局極爲重視，一般咸認，戰事應早結束，若干參政員則盼當局對是和是戰能有一明確表云。</p>
<p>馬乘風首起發言，指出對　戰爭結束經已二載，由於一連串的錯誤，乃鑄成今日現象，實爲一種悲劇，而政府對和戰問題究採何態度，吾人未能看到。和就和，戰就戰，應說個明白，不然，不特民衆無明確觀念，即士氣亦將受其影響。</p>
<p>張登鰲謂：「共軍割據區人民希望和平，但對和談却懷恐懼心理」。</p>
<p>民社黨劉中一再度呼籲，指出此種局面全國人民不能忍受，我們要求和平，惟和平非一方面之事。陳廣雅希望戰事能早日結束，和平能早日實現，俾由內戰走上安定，再走上建設之路。靑年黨局謙沖謂：和平爲老百姓一致要求，認軍事至今日局面，不應歸咎和談。</p>
<p>北方參政員關懷長時戰局，認當局不應僅重視山東，山西，而忽略東北。王寒生盼當局勿過分顧慮國際形勢，並盼能堅強該地兵力，以拯救可悲可憐之東北人民於水深火熱之中。新自長春趕來之崔垂言垂淚而言，當局所採「挨打主義」，老百姓可受不了，共軍進攻長春，其主要企圖在造成東北之糧食恐慌，蓋松花江流域爲東北主要產糧區，此外，南方代表則以廣東近事相詢，何是帆指出，由於粵省國軍實力薄弱，致共黨勢力潛入，不可不爲之防。</p>
<p>軍風紀問題，亦爲質詢集中點，若干參政員盼軍民切實合作，詢問最烈者爲錢公來，渠對東北某大員貪污行爲，猛加抨擊。蔡芷生報吿隴海全綫強佔民房，包庇貪污實情。錢等談及此類情事時，憤慨見於辭色，聽者動容。</p>
<p>參政員對編餘軍官咸表同情，盼能予以適當安置，俾無負於此輩在抗戰時期曾作最大努力之將土。書面詢問廿五件中，半數以上曾提及此問題。口頭詢問時，潘朝英等亦認最近在首都發生之哭靈事件爲一種「奇聞」，實無以對諸將士。此外，榮軍問題，陣亡將士家屬撫卹問題，亦爲注意焦點。</p>
<p>兵役問題，亦曾於詢問時提出，蔡芷生詢問河南征兵額何以如此衆多，並報告公開買賣壯丁事。此外，辦理兵役人員，接收壯丁，往往故意挑剔或延遲不接，盼當局注意。詢問至下午六時一刻許始畢。</p>
<p>繼由林次長簡單答詞，略謂：各參政員所提質詢，謹接受在國防部本身範圍內者，經研討後，當盡可能照辦，至其涉及其他部院者，亦當由政府研究後予以辦理。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕民盟張瀾，章伯鈞，韓兆　，梁漱溟，黃炎培等五參政員，頃擬就和平方案，於廿四日上午提交參政會</p>
<h3>經他陳啓天視事　王雲五親往辦理交待　新部他表示用人惟賢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕陳啟天廿四日上午九時赴經濟部視事。隨陳氏同時接事者，有新任政次張子柱，代理常次劉泗英，主任秘書朱世龍，總務司長王嵐僧等。前部長王雲五親往辦理交代，並於陳氏訓話前，先對該部高級職員介紹新部長。王稱：「本人去年今日出長經濟部，今年今日交代，恰滿一年」。渠對該部同仁對彼一年來之協助表示謝意，並謂，本人前任部長爲一學者，後任部長亦爲一學者。王於介紹陳氏之後，要求該部同仁協助新部長，一如協助其本人。王氏並聲明，在其一年任中所辦接收敵偽物資達千餘單位而未出差錯，最爲可慰。此均賴各同仁認真辦事之助。渠繼指出，經濟部爲一工業行政部門，年來對協助民營工廠己立基礎，有關工業法規完成者亦多，惟其他計劃因環境時局所限尚未着手，盼陳部長繼續進行，當全力以助。陳氏訓話時指出，當前經濟問題已成爲極嚴重之問題，非經濟部一部所能完全解決。渠恐難副國人期望。渠繼說明三點：第一，本人以靑年黨員身份出長本部，但本部爲國家機關，部內及一切附屬機關人員，無論黨籍如何，皆不分彼此，一視同仁，希望現有人員安心供職，第二，今後當局盡力健全工商行政，扶助民營事業，以求有利於經濟建設。本人當一本成規，信任專家，使能隨時改進，確立經濟建設之科學藝礎，供應人民生活之必需物資。第三，整個經濟問題，須先由全國經濟委員會全盤商討，再經國府委會作最後決定。陳氏訓話舉即開始辦公。</p>
<h3>俞大維報告交通</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕交他俞犬維廿四日在參會之報告約分兩部份，一為辦理上次參會決議。有關交通各案之執行情形，一為交通現況。前者約為下列數點：（一）鐵路修築部份，有天蘭成渝及湘桂黔路之都簧段，即將興工者有勝康，閩贛，閩奧，桂南等綫。（二）實施兵工築路部份，預定在三年內完成。甲種國道棧可容納總餘官兵十五萬人。此計劃正與國防部商洽中。（三）優先搶修戰災特重區之鐵路，其中南潯段大部完工，下月底可全部搶修完成。（四）整理郵電業務吸提高郵電效率。（五）民用航空之發展。（六）扶植民營航業之賠償。戰時徵用公商軍輛間題，已訂辦法。（八）免費輸送難民一事，尚在進行中。去年一年中，各鐵路輸送十五萬人，按票價二五折　費，公路輸送十二萬，以票價對折收購。（九）器材及員工之儲備，交部隨時均能辦到。（十）減低各國營交通事業價格部份，交通在貼補辦法下可實行緊縮，惟物價高漲，對於國府支出不可不加以考慮。</p>
<p>關於交通現況：</p>
<p>（甲）鐵路分關內關外兩部份，關外者尚可滿意，關內分三區，華北爲搶修區，華南爲整修區，西南西北爲興建區，華北部份更分三直綫，三橫綫。各綫修復情形均極困難，華南部份分三個標準：（一）爲保持通軍，一爲恢復戰前交通標準，一爲超過戰前交通標準，西南西北重要幹綫六條：（二）廣州灣至柳州，（二）柳州至貴陽，（三）貴陽至隆昌，（四）隆昌至成都，（五）成都至天水，（六）天水至聞州。另台灣之台南鐵路正接收中</p>
<p>（乙）公路分三區，西南為修復區，東南為搶修區，東北為興建區。</p>
<p>（丙）航空發展，航空不在飛機之多寡，而在地面設備之齊全，如好的倉庫，機塲，修理塲等，去歲歲末飛機失事，本部在良心上不能不有所譴責。目前正盡全力調整人事與充實設備中。</p>
<p>（丁）電信電報無論軍用民用電，均已提早時間，有一小時許即可送達收報人者。郵政亦已儘量改善，並普遍以航空代替，「行動郵局」亦經試辦。</p>
<h3>俞鴻鈞財政報告（續昨）</h3>
<p>改進租稅制度</p>
<p>戰前國家收入，以關鹽統三稅爲大宗，抗戰時期，因直接稅逐漸成長，亦成爲稅入主幹。今中央稅則遂有關鹽直貨四大體系。最近數年，財部對各稅基本制度，已經按其性質分別改進，其目標有三：（一）簡化稅制，便利商民，（二）配合經濟，維護生產，（三）運用租稅政策，調節財富分配。上年度爲實行擴大徽收範圍，對現行稅制，曾作進一步改進，因在稅政與稅收兩方面，俱收相當成效　先就直接稅言，其重要目標，在樹立健全合理稅制，兼顧負祖公平與稅收增進原則。最近設施爲：（一）推行分類綜合所得稅制度，以分類所得爲基礎，然後對每一個人全部所得總額之超過若干數目者加課綜合所得稅。（二）舉辦特種過分利得稅，對金融，信託，製造，營造，代理及買賣等業過分利得，予以課稅，其稅率自百分之十至六十。（三）開徵證券交易稅，對交易所內所做證券交易課稅，由原經紀人代扣彙繳國庫。（四）因財政收支系統法之修正，將營業稅劃歸地方接辦，就全國性之營業，籌辦特種營業稅，以銀行，保險，信託，交易所，進口商，國際及省際之交通事業，國營或官商合辦營利事業爲課稅對象，現已完成立法程序，不久可開始徽收。（五）籌辦一次財產稅，舉辦一次財產稅，係去年二月間復員緊急揹施案內所決議。本部遵照原案積極籌劃，但徵收財產稅，旣以全國人民財富爲對象，如非有精密財產調查與健全戶籍行政爲基礎，則難期公平，而在執行過程亦必多窒礙。本部爲慎重執行決策，認爲在籌辦時，必須考慮周詳，技術上困難問題，必須解決，經縝密研究，擬具四種徵課方式，呈報政府核奪。嗣奉政院核定，先舉辦全國財產總登記，就登記資料整理課稅，飭由本部會同內政部辦理，經邀集有關機關商訂實施步驟，積極推行。最近爲配合經濟緊急措施方案，鑒於財產登記緩不濟急，爰將財產稅徽課方法，重加研究，擬定徵課對象，對人對物並用，先就重要而易於控制之數種財產（如土地房屋外匯等）徵課比例稅一次，再就個人及法人財產超過若干限度者加課累進稅，以符能力負祖之原則。此項方案，已呈報政府，核定後即可實施。</p>
<p>就關稅言，政府爲配合外匯管理及發展貿易政策，去年曾先後加以調整，最初係隨開放外匯市塲頒行進出口貿易暫行辦法，將進口物品，分爲自由進口，許可進口，禁止進口三大類，以調節輸入。同時規定除少數物品須經特許外，均准自由結匯出口，以促進輸出，嗣國貨比口，因價格關係，未能暢銷，復於八月間再雅調整外匯時取銷出口稅，以資鼓勵。其後因進口太多，入超甚鉅，又於十一月間修正進出口貿易暫行辦法，全面推行輸入許可制雅，國內生產事業必需物品或原料，以及其他有正當用途物資，均予優先進口權利，非必需物品，則分別禁止，或停止輸入。迭次調整之目的，均有限制進口，獎勵出口，以期平衡國際貿易，綜計去年一年中，商貨進口總值爲一萬五千零十二　，出口總值爲四千一百二十一億，入超一萬零九百九十億（約合美金三億二千五百萬）。此項入超數字，雖甚龐大，但就進口貨品加以分析，則以棉花，　　，汽油，車輛，鋼鐵機　　　具橡皮及紙張等爲大宗，其次爲電器材料，五金錠塊，化學藥品，以及皮革等均屬復員期內急待補充的物資。自推行鼓勵出口與全面輸入許可制度後，國際貿易按照政府經建，計劃實施，不必要物資大量減少。統計本年截至三月底止，進口商貨總值七千九百七十五億餘，出口總值爲二千七百五十二億餘，較全面轍入許可制度處行前，入超顯已減少，但管制進口終屬一時權宜之計，欲求平衡國際貿易收支，自當運用嚴密稅則，才是根本辦法。關於此事，本部曾經長時間研究準備，最近已奉頒進出口稅則立法原則，作爲修訂根據，將來進出口稅則，對國內未能製造遂供應不足之工業，農業設備，機器，儀器，工具配件，醫藥器材進口，將減免進收稅，對國內加工之手工業機器工業，其成品推銷國外者，就其輸入之原料或半製品，酌予退稅，對國內供應不足的民生需品，將徵較輕進口稅或退，進口物品與國內應行保護幼稚工業出品有競爭性者，則課較重進口稅，奢侈品採寓禁於徵進口稅。至出口方面，凡屬應行獎勵輸出，免徵或減徵出口稅率。此原則並參照我國在世界貿易實業會議所接受之義務妥訂稅則，付諸實行，將來進出口貿易，當可得適當調節。</p>
<p>就鹽稅言，目前食鹽，按照三十五年初「鹽政綱領」規定，係採民製，民運，民銷政策，自由銷政策，自由買賣，政府僅在產銷方面加以調節，現在鹽稅是適用等差稅率。按照全國各區生產成本分爲四級。此外鹽務方面，爲配合經濟生產政策，採取下列各項重要揹施：（一）對於接收之鹽田鹽廠，積極整理開工，充分利用。（二）注意生產工業化，改良鹽區，減輕成本。（三）工業用鹽不論民營國營全部免稅，漁業鹽採輕稅政策。（四）沿海積存鹽斤，輸往日本，易取建設物資，以發展經濟建設。</p>
<p>就貨物稅言，爲符合奢侈品重我原則，並酊合經濟建設需要，已將貨物稅稅率調整，其中奢侈品爲洋酒，啤酒，土酒，土菸等稅率，各提高百分　二十至四十，同時又訂定礦產稅條例，將煤鐵稅率由百分之五降爲百分之三，以減輕國防工業與民生日用之負担，將　磁土銅錫等工業主要原料稅率，則由百分之十減爲百分之五。此外對所有外銷統稅貨品更採出口退稅原則，藉以鼓勵輸出。上年爲增闢稅源起見，又舉辦麥粉，水泥，茶叶，皮毛，錫箔及迷信用紙，飲料品，化妝品七項統稅。詳察各種貨品性質與消費者負担能力分別訂定不同稅率，藉以增裕庫收，配令經濟政策推行。</p>
<p>財務行政，一年來亦加積極整頓，求與改進稅制工作相配合，其致力事項：（一）緊縮機構。關於此點，貴會上次即經決議，要求政府切實辦理，本部照案執行，一年中裁併所屬各稅局一百五十餘單位，裁減人員一六點九六五人。今後尚擬繼續調整。（二）懲辦貪污，關於查察所屬稅務人員之風紀問題，曾由本部分區派遣視察人員常川調查，考察所有貪污違法事件，無論是人民檢舉，抑或視察報吿，一經查實定予嚴究。自上年四月到現在，部屬機關運法人員，經撤職停職者，共達三百餘。（三）厲行考銓制度。會同考選委會，舉辦特種財務員考試，錄取各方優秀靑年，以充實稅務組織。過去一年中已舉行兩次，此後將垂爲定制，遂年選補，冀從嚴格考選，建提高素質，革新人事之目的。（未完）</p>

<h3>張羣報告全文　續完</h3>
<p>在經濟方面，治標方法，經濟緊急措施方案頒佈三個月來，業生相當效果，但這方案有一部尚未實行，有一部因情勢變遷，不能不加以補充修改。例如工人生活指數的調整，與食米限價的解除，都與原方案有所變通。這個方案，有人加以批評，或提供其他辦法，但任何辦法，細加討輪，都有其利弊得失。方案本身原不是一成不變的東西，當我們沒有發現更完善的辦法之前，我們只好採用這個辦法，用執行進程中的事實經騐，加以補充修改，使他切合實際城要。關於原方案中必須管制的六種日用必需品，中國的米，本來不夠自給，棉花紗布更是差的多，非向國外購入不可，煤的生產，大都在東北，華北，就是廣東的用煤，也不能不仰給於華北。現在國內的煤鑛，被共黨破壞很多，如能節省使用，還勉強可以敷衍，食油及其原料禁止出口後，供應現不感缺乏，至於鹽與糖兩項都沒有問題。以上所述的六種，都是生活的基本必須，在生產運輸供應議節上，都有合理的籌劃與管理，如果國內的生產不足，不得不求之於國外，以免有匱乏之處，但從另一方面看，中國在戰前，除了第一次歐戰期間曾有出超外，平時都是入超的，八年戰爭之後，我們的工業殘破，農產低減，本年度國際收支差額甚大，收入方面，將華僑匯款計算在內，也止能抵補支出的一半，這是國家一個甚危險的現象。我們爲了顧及人民最低生活的需要，不得不買洋米，洋麥，洋紗，洋布，但備如並非生活的必需，便不應浪費國家的外匯，因此政府在輸入方面，不得不加以限制，在輸出方面，儘量予以獎助，出口貨物有困難時，最好由政府予以收購，即虧本亦所不惜。現正打算用這種政策增加出口，一方面可以彌補支出。關於補貼政策，用意原在於避免減少物價的刺激，目前各方面對於這個政策的批評不一，共有三種主張，各有其理由，正考慮商討中，但僅上述的各種辦法，還是不夠國家的需要。凡是一個有爲的國家民族，要想從農業國家進爲工業國家，或在對外戰爭之後，企求從速復興，都是要由全國人民，節衣縮食，可以享受而咬着牙不享受，運到國外去換取生產工具，用這種刻苦精神，來積累賸餘財力，集中於建設。在近代國家中，我們可以找出很多的前例，我們從農業國家要轉變爲工業國家，從戰爭摧殘後，要重建一個新中國，眞是憑藉較別人差一半，工作比別人重一倍。我們刻苦節約精神，不能夠達到建國的目的，然而這種精神的養成，不能單靠法令制度的力量，所以除了政府朝着這個方向努力之外，還得要社會人士，共同創造出這種民族認識　　會風氣才有效力。經濟緊急措施方案大半是屬於治標，縱能有效實施，也只能緩和物價的上漲，想要將中國經濟根本改善，生產增加，必須要一方面扶植民營經濟事業，一方面歡迎外資。關於扶植民營方面，現在政府不但對旣有民營必要事業，予以扶助，即國營事業，亦儘量賣出，使變爲民營根據民生主義之精神及其社會化的原則，定今後處理一切經濟問題的方針，以國家資本爲中心，領導私人資本之活躍，以國營事業任其難，扶助民營事業任其易。在利用外資方面，一個國家在戰爭凋敝之際，想要迅速恢復建設，非歡迎外資不可，看一看並世其他戰勝國家，除了美國之外，如英蘇法，都不能不求助於國外。中國本來就貧乏，八年戰爭中，公私財產直接間接所受的損失，前面所列舉的數目，真是可驚。我們固然依賴外債以彌補國家預算的超支，但我們現有的廣大區域，需要立即開始經濟復員與建設工作，這種工作，所需要的費用，自然不是我們現有國家財力與社會能担負本於這種情形，則美國的借款自關重要。政府將照改組政府後之施政方針進行，即舉借外債，必須用於穩定並改善人民生活及生產建設之用。至於國家地方財政收支的平衡，仍須我們本着自力更生的信念，不斷努力。至於整個經濟改革問題，本院已擬有方案，正呈國府審議中。此方案將來如何計劃實施，已組全國經濟委會任其事，因經常行政組織都以各種專門行政業務或技術爲劃分標準，在政院各部會中，其職掌與經濟事項有關部會，有七八單位，如無一組織加強各部會間聯繫，其舉揩步調不易一致，結果會影響政策的執行。至促進生產建設，此種配合更爲重要，故在經濟問題極端嚴重的今日，必須結合社會中各有關業務或技術專家和政府中各主管機關，使其得在一個組織，一定政策及分工合作原則下，集思廣益，共同努力。此組織雖政府提出，但重心部在社會工商事業家和專門經濟人才，倘不如此，便難應付當前嚴重局面，更談不到有計劃的改革，目前敎育問題。</p>
<h3>敎育問題</h3>
<p>在抗日時期，後方教育政府雖從未懈弛，但因戰時財政困難，交通阻碍，學校岡書設備不完備，教師與學生心情也都不密靜，雖戰時學校與學生都加多，但教育水準實此戰前低落。這種精神上損失，此物質損失，影響還要永久，戰爭結束後，並無改善。本人素來參加教育事業，到院後會邀集京中各校校長，院長，教授茶會，聽取目前學校中所遭受的困難和教育改進的意見，政府決定教育政策的憑藉。不想近來京滬等地一郃份大學學生，因公費生副食費，學校行政與學制問題，聚衆請願，遊行示威，甚至奪佔車輛，阻碍交通，盤踞機關，妨害公務，許多輕躁侮辱態度，不忍詳述。建國必先建人，如靑年學生風氣如此壞下去，中國十年後，人才恐慌更要深刻普遍。這種隱憂眞不堪設想，推原總病根，乃曲解自由。關於這個間題須得特別注意現憲政凖備階段，應該儘量發揮憲法的精神，凡憲法中所賦與人民的自由，能提早給與人民，即提早給與；但從另一方面講，國家須要耙律社會須要秩序，故人民守法精神與對國家的責任感，也要與其所享受的自由得比例提高，然後自由與法治，才能相輔相成，成爲現代化的民主國家；而道種守法紀，重秩序，自尊愛國的品德，應是由智識靑年爲一般人民的領導，從學校中傳播到社會。加在校正受教育的靑年先己認識不清，放肆無度，何能夠期望一般國民風氣好轉？因此，政府須要充分保障人民應享的自由，但為維持社會安寗，萬不得已時，限制越軌行動，也是必須採取的措施。</p>
<p>今天在校靑年都是將來建國幹部，國家希望他們能具有高深智識，尤希望他們具有謹嚴操守，因此我們必須愛護今日在校青年，培養他們的知識德行，使能卓然自立，出校後担當得起建國使命。政府與學校師長，家庭父兄，應共間負此責任。</p>
<p>至加強學校設備，穩定教師生活，獎助民問教育事業，乃政府應採措施，各位參政員先生，如有意見，還請指敎。本人在這艱難時候，受任行政院長，自己審度才力，實在是戒愼惕懼，惟有鞠躬盡瘁，求於國事有所裨補。本人并非有甚麼天才，也不會創浩奇蹟，面對當前艱難局勢，如何才是最正確有效的方案，除政府自己殫精竭慮之外，還須要各位參政員先生共同籌劃，多多指教！（完）</p>
<h3>左舜生報告農林施政</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕左舜生在參政會上之報吿詞，內容多爲事實，未嘗涉及計劃政策方面。左氏首先聲明本人到任九天，過去報吿，已有周前部長之書而報吿，不再餐述。左氏旋即就農林部成立以來之歷史經費兩點稱：本部成立七年以來，部長、之調動，迄於本人，前後共六人，可謂人事調動頻繁，而農林部經費佔總預算亦僅及千分之五，故在人事及經費兩點觀之，在行政系統上，實未被重視。惟本人並不悲觀。其一，即因農部主管各事均與每一個人之衣食住行有關，，其次農部之組識業已具備，共計七司兩委會，尚有研究部份各種試騐所等，僅待將來充實，前途實有希望。</p>
<p>左氏繼稱：本人認爲：第一，學術機關技術性人村，決不予以更動，任何派系均以人才爲重，決不以靑年黨爲鬣。第二，爲研究工作應予加強，以求改進，同時與專門人才取得密切聯繫。左氏當提出一不完備之統計稱：全國有一萬五千人弱爲農業方面之專門人材，而目前用於本行者不足五午人，本人擬使此不獲機會之一萬人能各得其所，各盡所長，以有限經費交與最可靠人士去辦理，並發農農林事業。第三，希望全國人士能對農林部工作有所瞭解。未左氏提出該部幾件實例，盼各參政員能前往參觀：第一爲卅五年六月組成之中美農業技術合作團之工作，以美專家十人與我國所派十三位專家組成，經十一個星期，從事中國農林之考察，返京後根據所見，以五星期時間寫成報吿，該團所注意之目標有三：即（一）中國農林教育，（奪）中國農業生產遝銷，（三）生活水土之利用等，極合適用。第二，中央農事試騐听，內分十個系，以極少經費以進行工作，年僅十億元。第三，為農產改進處係本年一月始成立，其本年度之工作目標，第一步擬恢復戰前五千二百萬棉田，生產中美改良棉種一二五〇萬担，其中七二八萬担係供紡機者。第四，菸草改進所，本年菸貸一五六億，加工一二四億，此款分配大部份供給河南菸草改進，小部份供給安徽。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本政局動向</h3>
<p>日本吉田內閣於二十日辭職之後，繼任首相何人？乃爲世人注視的焦點，參衆兩院於二十三日選舉首相，結果社會黨領袖片山當選，且已於昨日就任首相之職，開始與自由黨，民主黨，暨國民協同黨領袖會晤，共商組織四黨聯合內閣事宜，預料新閣可望於下星期內組織成立。今後日本政局的動向，當然值得我們密切的注意。</p>
<p>日本的新憲法，已於五月三日起實施。新選的議會，於二十日召開，看幾天來選舉議長及內閣首相的情形，政局已日趨明朗化。依照新憲法而產生的議會，由參議院與衆議院構成，衆議院的地位較重要；而首相則由兩院共同選舉。新憲法首次參議院，於廿日開會，松平當選正議長，社會黨松平治一郎當選副議長。衆議院於廿一日開會，社會黨松岡駒吉當選正議長，民主黨田中萬逸當選副議長。由於社會黨在議會議長選舉的勝利，如片山當選首相，奠下了穩固的基礎。廿三日上議會繼續開會，衆議院以四二〇票對六票，衆議院以二〇五票對二票，社會黨片山哲當選內閣首相，獲到了壓倒的勝利。這是日本政局新的轉變，也是建立新日本的開始。</p>
<p>日本社會黨成立於一九四五年十一月二日，爲日本投降後首先成立的政黨。它標榜社會民主主義，有人誤稱爲「社會民主黨」，該黨歷史雖短，但它是戰前社會大衆黨與勞農黨的後身，社會主義者安部磯雄爲其靈魂。日本的社會主義，派系多，思想新，所以社會黨成立以來，內部有左右派的分野。大體言之，右派以西尾末廣，平野力三，松岡駒吉等爲中心：左派以水谷長三郎，加藤十，鈴木茂三郎爲中心。該黨綱領重要精神有三項：（一）爲勞動階級之結合體，其目的在於確保政治自由及民主主義體制；（二）排斥資本主義：實行社會主義，以期安定並提高國民生活；（三）反對一切軍國主義之思想及行動，與世界各國協力，實現永久和平。根據這綱要的精神，去年九月廿八日決定了十一項政策，其對政治經濟社會要求的制度，表現的思想，與英國工黨政策接近，方式是漸進的，手段是和平的，無共產黨之偏激，更無馬列主義之不斷鬥爭，所以民主主義批評它是社會民主主義，共產主義批評它爲改良社會主義，實則政策精神爲社會改良主義。當社會黨成立之初，片山哲爲該黨書記長，後任委員長，爲事實上的黨魁。他生於一八八七年的歌山縣，一九一二年畢業於東京帝大法科，曾主持「法律相談所」「法律新聞」，及勞動總同盟法律部。其後，他曾參加農民勞動黨，社會民衆黨，社會大衆院，並一度發起國民勤勞黨，旋即解散。一九四二年，東條內閣實行「翼贊政治會」，片山未獲推荐，致該屆競選衆院議員失敗。至於，渠於軍事法西斯的專制政治下，隱逸鄉野，潛心讀書，不問政治，到日本接受波茨坦宣言爲止。渠今年六十歲，在政治社會運動中，有三十六年歷史，從未入宦，或務工商，或執教大學，僅五次當選衆院議員。此次片山當選首相，可謂爲世界現政治之第二「平民首相」。</p>
<p>日本政治，自明治以來，係以資產階級貴族軍閥爲中心，往昔四十六屆的內閣，首相皆出身貴族大將或官僚，來自民間的「平民首相」，唯犬養毅一人。但犬養爲財閥代言人，其思想其抱負，如與今日的片山比較，犬養瞠乎其後矣。片山在日本社會運動及政治上，確爲非常人物，麥帥亦讚美渠爲理想的民主主義者。在日本投降一年又九個月的今天，社會黨飛躍的崛起，在國會中取得第一黨地位，在新閣取得「總揆百僚」的地位，斷非偶然。第一，年來自由黨執政，劣跡昭彰，怨聲載道，吉田逢迎麥帥成功了，但對社會經濟之複蘇，日本復興工作之進行，尚漫無頭緒。片山爲政治新人物，有毅力，有作爲，觀其當選首相後十分鐘，即發表談話：「本日國會中被全體議員一致推選爲首相，不勝感激。爲打開日本民族之危機，與建立新日本，本人當出至誠，全力以赴」。其語電心長，躍然紙上。第二，片山在議會兩院獲得完全的選票，實爲衆望所歸，片一山組閣協議，與民主黨國民協同黨，獲得妥協，祗自由黨立於反對立塲，但兩院自由黨議員投票，仍多支持片山，足徵日本黨派利益，儘管有異同，然面臨大難，則舉國一致。</p>
<p>據東京消息，片山組閣工作，將於廿六日開始，片山決以旣定之政策方針，組織四黨的聯合政府，至自由黨是否入閣，不無疑問。如片山完全失去保守勢力的合作，前途障礙必多。因爲今天的保守勢力，控制着社會經濟的重要部門，及地方行政與議會。不過，片山有魄力，有手腕，且有麥帥相當之支持，料片山必得人和渡此難關。總之，日本政局經月來之選舉及演變，已逐漸明朗，對美關係日愈圓滑，對外貿易亦將恢復，祗有對日和約的應付，尚待新政府的安排。</p>

<h3>英內閣舉行會議　批准印督計劃書　印度分治殆已無可避免　傳蒙巴頓將于下週四返印度任所</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕印督蒙巴頓與英內閣之談判已於今日結束，內閣會議業已批准印督擬於六月二日向印度領袖提出關於政權移轉程序之計劃書。印督並未參加內閣會議，但渠曾接見印度臨時政府商務部長，回教同盟之宗特里加及尼赫魯駐倫敦之私人代表梅農，聽取回印兩方之意見。艾德禮首相同時已將印督計劃之大概告知各反對黨領袖。邱吉爾及其他保守黨領袖之反響，一時尚無從探悉，惟自由黨領袖台維斯則已表示同意該項計劃。政府方面稱：國會已於今日起休會，印督計劃之內容須俟印督在德里會議中向印度領袖提出後，始能正式宣布。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿三日電〕據悉：蒙巴頓將於下週四返印度任所，行前當再與內閣會商一切。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿三日電〕英內閣雖已於今日批准印督蒙巴頓之計劃，但若干印度人士則料在明年六月即英國退出印度之限期以前，難望成立完全的解決辦法。印度制憲議會主席警拉　表示，回盟會長眞納要求在印度斯坦境內取得巴基斯坦東西兩部之走廓，乃不能接受的建議。本哲有·德里·聯合省·畢哈爾及孟加拉之一部勢必爲其切斷，其距離長達一千六百公里，所經者均為非回敎徒之區域。晉拉薩對於印度之分治，表示痛恨，但曰如決定實行分治，則國大黨將要求孟加拉及孟哲布兩省之分治。普氏復認印度實行分治以後，軍隊之劃分亦必不能避免。又印度最富有之巴賽族領袖莫第亦表示反對印度之分治，蓋分治以後巴基斯坦及印度斯坦之地位均將創弱，使印度減少在世界上之重要性。回盟連絡部今日宣布，已致電艾德禮首相，印度事務部大臣李斯托威爾及印督蒙巴頓，請彼等爲三千萬回教徒主持正義。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕一般人士皆料英政府雖將向印度領袖重提英內聞之印度聯邦計劃，然印度之實行分治已屬無法避免。彼等復相信分治如確屬無法避免，必須以民主的方法微求印度人民代表之意見，就國大黨·錫克族·印度基督徒及若干土邦而言，現有之制憲議會，已堪爲徵詢意見之機構。惟就回教徒言，則因回盟之抵制制憲議會，故必須另設回盟制憲議會。關於孟加拉及本哲布兩省之分治問題，似尚須舉行公民投票以資決定，而西北邊省之問題亦需要以特別方法加以決定。英方人士皆認時間爲印督程序計劃之主要因素，敌在全國舉行公民投票，殆已無此可能。英方人士復力言一切決議均將由印度領袖決定，若印度領袖同意印督所提之計劃，則今後之憲政決議亦當悉由印度領袖爲之。</p>
<h3>片山當選首相　麥帥備致揄揚　片山極表欣慰稱有裨組閣工作</h3>
<p>〔國際赴東京廿四日電〕片山於廿四日午後五時卅分驅車晉謁麥帥，作就任首相後之苜次拜訪。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿四日電〕日本社會黨領袖片出當選首相後，麥帥立即發表公報，謂片山以基督教領袖而領導全國，實爲日本歷史創舉，反映日本對於宗教之完全容忍，亞洲國家其他兩大領袖，即中國蔣主席與菲律濱羅哈斯總統，均爲基督教徒，片山之當選首相，證明日本人追隨非極端之政策，國際方面宣傳日本最近之選舉爲反動勢力的勝利之說，於此不攻而自破矣。片山哲對麥帥聲明甚表欣慰，渠稱：「如果其他各政黨之領袖等仔細研究麥帥之聲明，則余組織新閣之工作將較爲容易，余最初之願望即爲成立一個政府，對於世界之和平及日本之幸福皆能有所貢獻。余從無以不合理方法出任首相之願望。」</p>
<p>新舊首相昨日交接</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿四日電〕片山首相親任式於廿四日下午五時，在宮中舉行，本日上午十時及下午二時，吉田內閣曾兩度召開閣議，討論新舊首相交接問題，其後入江法制局長官又邀請社會黨代表商談，結果決定即時移交。下午四時吉田進宮，報吿議會指名片出任首相事，下午五時乃舉行片山新首相親任式。吉田前首相及松岡駒吉。松平恒雄兩院議長均參加典禮。</p>
<p>吉田稱病　拒絕會談</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿四日電〕片山首相原定廿五日與各黨總裁會談，以便懇請協力組閣工作，但因自由黨吉田總裁以身體不適爲理由，拒絕會談，以致預定會談之舉又須延期。自由黨大野幹事長於廿四日宣稱：「片山內閣並無邀請自由黨入閣之意，倘四黨幹事長會談所協定之政策付諸實施，則本黨將在閣外予以協力。」至於民主黨內部情形，亦殊複雜，其所以再三要求組織四黨聯合內閣者，傳係幣原派強欲置片山內閣於流產境地之一種手段，雖廿二日蘆田與西尾會談，對於三黨聯合組閣，已有相當諒解，然結果恐亦只能組成社會·國協兩黨及民主黨田派之二黨半聯合內閣，而民主黨內部勢將分裂。</p>
<h3>片山為人軟弱　日是皇頗表關切</h3>
<p>〔國際社東京廿四日電〕松岡衆議院議長，廿四日午後三時五十分　宮覲見日皇，奏吿衆院選舉首相人選經過情形時，曾與日皇問答如下：（日　）據報載片出爲人頗軟弱，議長意見如何？（松岡）所傳確屬事實，片出爲人如處於被攻擊地位，頗嫌軟弱，惟茍予正當護衛，則訂發揮意外之堅強作風。（日　）組閣工作宋完成前，僅由　　大臣獲理政務，片山一人能否勝任？（松岡）片出當在可能範圍內，儘速推選閣僚輔佐。（日學）組閣是否尙需二星期？（松岡）政局不容如是托延，當於數日內努力求其成立。</p>
<h3>印動亂不已　各地破壞慘重</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿三日電〕今日爲錫克族之偉大宗教節，本哲布省首邑拉　爾城戒備嚴密，以防發生事端。同詩在西北邊省境內，動亂仍繼續發生不已，該省馬爾丹城之回教同盟示威者，搗毀市政府，許多村莊之稅收　　，亦被破壞。西北邊省首邑貝夏華城回盟　員繼續遊行示威，以示反對該省之國大黨政府。彼轉一度華登監獄外牆，城外響水池被炸受輕微損失。拉霍爾城自五月十四日之暴動以來，　　　　百〇八人，財產損失估計　一百萬鎊，被焚房屋達一百五十所，內有印度教及錫克教寺院十餘座，以及本哲布省最大地主之住宅。今每日撤離拉霍爾城之印度教徒約五千人，印度教徒之商行銀行等均計劃遷至德里。錫克族之聖地阿姆里察城昨發生炸彈爆炸案。</p>
<h3>英艦隊將舉行　夏季大演習　參加軍艦六十餘艘</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社廿三日電〕海軍部本日宣佈：英國內艦隊定五月卅一日開始舉行夏季演習，參加演習之軍艦將共有六十餘艘，包括主力艦三艘·航空母艦二艘·巡洋艦五艘·驅逐艦卅艘·潛水艇廿艘及其他軍艦若干艘（其數目並未宣佈）。此等軍艦若干艘，將於六七八三個月內訪問英國及歐洲各國之港口，演習地點將在公海之上，由國內艦隊司令西佛萊特上將在旗艦「約克郡公爵」號上發號施令。</p>
<h3>義前總理雖斯貝利　再受命組織新閣　擬羅各派解除當前經濟危機</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教廿四日廣播：加斯貝利今日接受總統尼古拉之正式命令，繼任義大利聯合政府首揆，加氏爲基督教民主黨領袖，在正式受命組閣以前，早已與其他各鯊領袖開始談判。渠希望新閣內共黨及左翼社會當實力較五月十三日辭職之內閣爲削弱。據貝氏談稱：「關於余之施政方針，早爲國人所共知，即係　致各黨各派之誠意合作，克服經濟危機，解決當前之急切問題」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿三日電〕義大利八大政黨已於今日一致推舉加斯貝利領導新政府。關於加斯貝利欲逐出共黨一事之可能性，各政黨皆已拒絕，惟削弱共黨在政府內之勢力，則似己不可避免，蓋尼蒂與奧倫社組閣失敗後，已增強加斯貝利之地位故也。</p>
<h3>義法政情如出一轍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐〕義大利受杜魯門總統新外交政策之影響，繼法國之後，亦在轉趨右傾。義閣潮迄今已歷十日，各政治領袖組閣相繼失敗後，現復由加斯貝利策劃組閣擴大基礎，增加右翼保守派人員，以削弱共黨及左翼社會黨之勢力。加斯貝利之動機本欲義大利趨向右面，以取得美國之經濟援助，蓋杜魯門主義即爲對遏阻共產主義及對抗蘇聯侵略之外國，給予金元之援助故也。目前美國進出口銀行代表間即將與義官員談判貸予一億美元借款一事，同時美國會通過救濟外國之三億五千萬美元一項法案後，義大利亦可獲得一部份，故義大利今日之政治情形，實與法國相同。</p>
<h3>我駐法使館　歡宴衛立煌</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕中國駐法大使館於本日正午歡宴衛立煌將軍，新任法駐麽洛哥總監茹盎將軍暨法駐蘇大使賈德魯均在座作陪。衛將軍定於廿七日飛往喀沙城，參觀法空軍轟炸訓練學校，並將由法空軍參謀長范奧萊將軍招待，預料術將軍於本月杪訪晤法陸軍總監台拉特爾將軍之後，即離法返國。</p>
<h3>杜魯門咨請國　延長管制進出口</h3>
<p>〔路透社　盛　廿三日電〕杜魯門總統今日要求開會批准對戰時就若干種糧食肥料工　　備分　之管制，自六月三十日起展延一年，以維持國內生產支持美國之外交政策。渠請求屆會繼續對油脂，米類，產物之進口管制，予以批准，總統之咨文，復主張美國繼續參加國際緊急糧食委員會之分配制度，力言美國必須採取必要步驟，限制他國所缺之糧食輸入美國，以免增加他國之飢　恐慌。總統折出自大戰結束以來，美國農工業生產已建立新記錄，茍他國生產亦能保持類似高度，管制當無必要，惟以世界新後復興工作進展遲綏，使某種物品之管制有繼續保留之必要。美國本身因管制而受之影響，若與世界其他大部份國家今日所面臨之悲慘的生活條件相較，誠屬至微。該種生活條件對於政治社會均有鬣大影響云。</p>
<h3>蘇聯提建議　恢復對日貿易</h3>
<p>擬　日貨達數百萬美元</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿三日電〕今日據悉，麥帥總部正與蘇聯代表談判一宗貿易，涉及價值數百萬美元之日本貨。是爲戰後蘇聯初次踏進大規模對日貿易，過去則僅取得少數　子。聞此宗貿易中一部份純屬購買，一部份爲實物交換。盟國管制委員會蘇聯委員特勒維安基中將經濟顧問拉辛吿聯合社記者稱，蘇方建議業巳遞交麥帥總部對外貿易處，希望即可締結合同。據麥帥總部人士透露，蘇聯擬購漁船，車頭與鐵路配備，並願供給烟煤，焦煤，鋼製品及矽酸高鐵，以爲交換。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿三日電〕此間政界人士談稱：聯合國巴爾幹事實調查委員會以希臘北部之遊擊隊活動責諸南斯拉夫保加利亞與阿爾巴尼亞三國，此舉殆可視爲美國對地中海已定有新政策之明證。反之，關於美國對希臘政府之態度，例如白宮與國務院昨日最後討論援助希臘法案時所重申之立塲及聲明，美國希望希臘擴大政府頒佈特赦等情，雖美國對此不擬施以壓力使之實行，但又使此間若干無黨無派之希臘人士爲之迷惑不解。又據此間希臘人士談稱：希臘之將來，胥視迅速解決特赦問題而定，蓋其具有兩重作用故也。即（一）倘能誠意寶行特數，則擴大希臘政府即可易於實現，應否由聯合國中之觀察小組加以保障，亦可不成問題，且需要美國之軍火，亦可不必如目前之急迫，而國家經濟自可獲受其益。（二）倘不行特數，則征伐遊擊隊之戰事將無結束之期，徒耗可以充作其他用途之金錢而已。以言特數倘無充份之保陣，則亦不能敉平內亂。故希望美國先解決特數之重要間題云。</p>
<h3>國際銀行借款　法議會批准</h3>

<h3>美國決定經濟援希後　希臘復興的展望</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>美國以經濟援助給予希臘，同時須考慮到建設希臘復興希臘的問題。杜魯門總統要求以二億五千萬美元貸與希臘的目的，是要帮助該國恢復獨立自由國家的地位。在這一筆貸款的背後，還需要美國的縝密的計劃和指示，作爲覓求地中海和平的代價。</p>
<p>關於怎樣運用這筆貸款，已有人提出種種問題。美國的計劃尚待草擬，但根據調查所得，姑作如下的澦測。</p>
<p>從好的方面推想</p>
<p>在美國的協助下建立希臘經濟，統一希臘政治，改善希臘陸軍，不出數年希臘可能立定脚跟，回復到自給自足的境地。</p>
<p>在一九四七年中，希臘也許並不需要二億五千萬元全部貸款。在這一年中，希臘大約將支出三億五千萬元，包括穀類·煤·機器·織物和其他供應品二億元，建設費五千萬元，軍事設備一億元。同年的收入總額約一億三千萬元，包括出口業盈利約八千五百萬元，運輸業盈利九百萬元，美國的私人匯款三千六百萬元。</p>
<p>收支相抵不足之數二億二千萬元，大約將以下列各款抵補之；現尚存於進出口銀行的一千五百　元，聯總救濟物資一千二百萬元，　國對解放各國救濟金中希臘應得部分計五千萬元。其餘虧短之數計一億四千三百萬元，將以新借款抵補之。</p>
<p>一九四八年度希臘生產量及國外盈利可望增加，使虧短之數減至一億八千萬元，假定建設及發展費為一億元。其中大部分可以一九四七年餘款抵補，但至少可從美國獲得八千萬元新借款。</p>
<p>此後十年中，希臘每年需要建設費約七千萬元。至一九五八年時，美國可能在希臘投資十億元。但除非美國處置得當，希臘能和美國合作，同詩世界保持和平，否則以上種種預測是不會實現的。</p>
<p>從壞的方面推想</p>
<p>美國借給希臘的貸款可能用之於希臘人的自相殘殺，供希臘官塲的榨取或用之於與復興希臘無關的事項，萬一有此情形，美國或許不願以有用的金錢虛擲，而聽任希臘陷入混亂局面，讓希臘共產黨把希臘送入蘇聯的懷抱中去。</p>
<p>爲了避免這一種局面，希臘和美國當局必須善爲處置。</p>
<p>援希計劃的大綱</p>
<p>援助希臘的計劃尚在起草中但根據聯總·聯合國·聯合國糧食農業組識等機構在希臘研究所得，可得該計劃的梗概如下：</p>
<p>計畫的要點有三：一是國家的安全，在美國的指導下把希臘陸軍加以改組，使能負起堡衛國家的任務；二是政治的安定，勸導希臘各黨派實行合作，使政局趨於穩定；三是重新建立民衆的信心。</p>
<p>計劃的主要目的是要恢復希臘的生產力，使它能夠自給目足。</p>
<p>希臘的物價問題，不特阻碍國內貿易，同時亦威脅國外貿易。如欲開發貿易，必先抑平物價。在希臘國內，製造品價格高昂，而農產價格低廉。如欲加以調整，須把日用必需品稅取消，同時對農業合作社增加製造品的配給量。</p>
<p>希臘出口貨的價格遠較世界市塲的價格爲高。爲獎勵出口業起見，不妨以外匯來付給希臘出口商的一部份利潤。待信用恢復以後，可放置外匯基金，以穩定希臘幣制。但要改革幣制，必光核減政府支出。</p>
<p>其次，希臘的運輸業必須設法恢復。要使希臘鐵路全部復元，約需七千萬美元。戰前的鐵軌僅百分之五十九可供應用。自一九三九年以來，希臘共損失貨車百分之八十二，機關車百分之七十六。希臘的公路異常惡劣，貨車行駛速率僅每小時十一英里。全國貨軍一萬輛，目前雖已足敷應用，但大多數已經敝舊，不堪久用。</p>
<p>希臘無論何處離開海面沒有超過七十哩以上的，因此沿岸航業的發展對於希臘將有極大帮助。但運輸工具在戰時遭受極大損書，全部重建大約需款五千三百萬美元。沉沒在哥林斯運河中的船舶將設法打撈，以廢料出售與希臘的工塲。　希臘海運業不久務恢復至戰前狀態。希臘現有自由艇九十九艘，「C—一」型艇二艘，都是向美國賒買來的。故目前希臘的商船總計約一百七十萬噸，都是比較新式的艦船。</p>
<p>烟草是希臘的一份貴重資產，曾一度佔着希臘全部出口業的半數以上。如果價格和土耳其烟草不相上下，那麼美國準備向希臘購買更多烟草。美國捲烟的生產量較之一九三八年雖已增加了一倍，但所用東方烟草的比例已自百分之十一減至百分之五·七。假如東方烟草的比例增加到百分之八·五，希臘將以一萬四千噸烟草售與美國，賸下三萬二千噸將售與歐洲各國。</p>
<p>預備推銷到歐洲去的其他物產尚有葡萄酒，葡萄乾，無花果，硝皮藥水及松脂等。</p>
<p>治標治本的辦法</p>
<p>美國刻正搜求專家意見，作爲擬具希臘復興計劃的參考，同時取得希臘人的合作。英國及其他與國將藉發展貿易來協助希臘的復興。</p>
<p>短期的援助希腦，目的只在加強希臘陸軍和安定希臘通貨的貸款，只是治標的，一旦用完以後，却一無所有</p>
<p>要使希臘恢復昔日的繁榮，必須有長期的治本計劃。杜魯門總統說：美國準備援助希臘抵抗侵略勢力，使它變成一個「自立自尊的民主國家」。希臘，蘇聯以及世界各國均將拭目以待。（譯自「世界報吿」週刋）</p>

<p>市參議會財政委員會，前曾由二資助大會交議關於王維　等數十參議員提出之「建議中央及市府整理各種舊債，確定合理償還辦法」一案，擬具方案提出本次大會討論。茲悉各參議員對於一還一之原則，極端反對，蓋目前生活指數已達一萬八千倍以上，物價指數已超過三萬倍，即以最低之公敎人員薪奉加成數目計，亦合一千八百倍，故經財政委員會決定整理原則四項，提供本次大會，（一）一對一之償還，確屬過低，人民損失過鉅。（二）建議政府對銀行存款與公債之償還辦法同時解決。（三）政府應以全力維持債信。（四）以新憤換回舊債，以免通貨膨漲，但須視公債發行之性質與年份，確定合理償還辦法。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕市參議會彙集各參議員提案中，內有唐參議員世昌等對本市征兵事項提議，略謂：「當此人心浮動，社會不寗之秋，本市暫緩抽丁，則可避免刺激，减少誤會，消弭不必要之騷動。目前從事生產，不下於服兵役之重要，故持請市府轉呈中央，招募失業退伍等人服役」云。</p>

<h3>貧民配米月內實現　購米證已在印製　將交區公所轉發</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工廠學校配米，正由社會局審核中，至昨日爲止，已有一部份完竣，下星期即可先行配售，繳款地點已洽定市銀行。各工廠學校申請經社會局審核認可後，即以核准配米通知書交各單位，向指定銀行繳款換取提米證後，憑證轉向糧食部上海糧食總倉庫提米，手續極爲簡單</p>
<p>規定標準·防止舞弊</p>
<p>社會局長吳開先，昨語記者稱：貧民配米事，本月內當力促其實現。該項貧民標準，前經規定爲老弱寡孤殘廢無人供養以及月入三十萬元而有家庭負擔者，由各區區公所及警察局負責調查。現購米證已在印製，待印就後交各區公所轉發貧民，購米證上需塡註姓名，將來購米時，須出示國民身份證騐看，與購米證相符後方始售予，以防舞弊。該項貧民配米白米每石價十六萬八，秈米十四萬七。工廠代辦米日前糧食部曾來電提高至每石廿四萬元，現社會局已呈請市府向糧食部交涉，仍維持原價</p>
<p>調查手續·頗多困難</p>
<p>又貧戶配米辦法，社會局前建議由政府主辦，分別在各區成立公賣處或平糶站，但調查貧民手續頗爲困難，故市府參事葛克信提議貧民配米事宜，交由自治機構及慈善團體辦理，以其對貧民較爲接近且有經騐，但亦有其相當缺點，故昨日下午三時，市府召集商討貧民配米問題之會議，對此尙米決定採用何種辦法，留待吳局長及吳市長核定。</p>

<h3>長江流域今可轉晴</h3>
<p>近日天氣劇變，氣溫低减，茲據上海氣象台台長鄭子政昨晚解釋原因略稱：在廿日以後，我國西南部份暖氣團非常發展，因此翌日於湘贛附近形成低氣壓，至當晚整個長江流城包括上下游，被陰雨籠罩，其中心漸移至漢口東南區，前晨八時直至昨晨，發現聞歇性陣雨，至其原因，則係華中有冷空氣向東南推進所致，是以本市風力驟大，雨勢加緊，至目前爲止，華中高氣壓可能於當晚推至長江中游，預料今日長江一帶即可天氣晴朗，且大雨區域可轉移至東南沿海一帶，如廣州·溫州·福州等地。關於近日雨量，據鄭氏估計共爲四一·七耗等於一·六四英吋。至氣溫問題，按二十二日最高爲華氏七四度二，昨日最低爲五五度二，相差爲十九度。茲將該台天氣預測，誌之如下：</p>
<p>黃海：曇，晴，局部晨霧，中度北風，中浪。</p>
<p>華中：陰，局部雨或晨霧，中度北風至東風。</p>
<p>上海：陰，陣雨轉曇意，晨夕有霧，淸和風至北風。</p>

<h3>本市罷課各學校　日內可次第復課　內部衝突昨續有發生</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕本市若干學校罷課風潮，由於同學認識學潮內慕而警覺者日益增多，故復課護校已成各校之普遍呼聲，主張復課之多數同學，正積極展開爭取復課自由的奮鬥。「後援會」份子，雖仍力圖煽動，但爲各校大多數同學反對，已呈弩末之勢，預料多數罷課學校，均將於日內復課，惟一二學校之內部衝突，仍未戢止。中學方面，因受「後援會」份子之煽動，亦發生互毆之不幸事件，殊堪痛心。茲誌昨日各校情况如下：</p>
<p>復旦</p>
<p>復旦大學，昨日除少數學生未上課，及一小部份敎授未到外，大部份同學均仍照常上課。下午三時該校舉行校務會議，商討前日不幸事件之處理辦法，決定：鑒於目前形勢，本校應從速照常上課，幷請敎授多方勸導。</p>
<p>上法</p>
<p>上海法學院，昨日下午三時十五分，突有卡車載來校外學生三十餘人，該校散發傳單，張貼漫畫標語，幷召集學生開會，其時該校正在上課。多數同學均不願參加，以致空氣頓形緊張。四川北路警察分局得報後，由王股長率警前往，當警軍駛至該校門口時，校門業經關閉，校內並發出槍聲兩響，且有磚塊自校內拋出，當由王股長向該校諸代院長鳳儀詢問情形，經商討決定，即由校方派人檢查，有無校外學生仍留該校，經查悉所有校外學生，均於警軍趕到數分鐘前離去。警員亦即於四時廿五分離校返局。</p>
<p>交大</p>
<p>交大復課運動，經該校學生正義大同盟之努力，昨已積極展開，各系科致授，亦同時向學生勸導復課，該校吳校長，昨日下午發出佈吿，希望學生勿往他校開會宣傳，幷拒絕他校學生來校宣傳開會，並切望同學接受勸吿，自下星期一（二十六日）起復課。另悉，該校「系科代表大會」前爲聲援「南京事件」，決定於本星期日（二十五日）絕食一天，惟事前幷未徴求學生同意，致爲大部份學生所反對，經向膳團負責人偵詢後，自治會已宣佈，暫緩絕食」云。</p>
<p>大夏　據大夏大學息：昨日上午八時，有少數學生企圖煽動罷課，並封鎖敎室，割斷電話，主張上課之多數同學，咸表不滿，經組織「反罷課運動委員會』，貫澈上踝主張，至下午即繼續上課，秩序如常。</p>
<p>大同</p>
<p>大同大學學生，昨日已自支整理課桌，並撕去所有不必要之標語，準備明日復課，但仍堅決要求貫澈關於革新校政之八項要求，學生自治會同學，則仍留校辦公，全校敎授經同學分別訪謁，請求復課，多數均表接受。</p>
<p>光華</p>
<p>光華大學昨晨十時，突有校外學生，乘卡車兩輛前往張貼標語，散發傳單，宣傳罷課，並召集開會，其時該校同學正在上課，咸表示拒絕，該學生等即悻悻離去。</p>

<p>上海醫學院學生，昨日展開護校運動，宣傳復課，幷散發「告同學書」，及「告家長書」，多數同學，均表響應，該校可望於一二日內復課。</p>
<p>震旦</p>
<p>震旦大學，昨日上午有醫學院學生數十人，前往宣傳罷課，經開會討論後，大部份學生，對南京不幸事體，表示遺憾，但反對罷課，故該校昨仍上課如常。</p>
<p>法政</p>
<p>上海法政學院，昨亦照常上課，有少數學生發動嚮應「五·二〇慘案後援會」惟簽名者，爲數極少，該校自治會昨午三時，曾召集會議，商討維護本身學業，幷保持該校光榮，決不採取罷課行動，幷及對校外學生，前往該校宣傳，或用壓力威脅。</p>
<p>上商</p>
<p>上海商學院一部份學生，響應「五二。慘案後援會」，昨日强迫同學簽名罷課，結果簽名者僅有百餘人，按該校全部同學，約四百餘人，某報前日兼稱該校十餘學生開會響應罷課，實係誤傳，該校昨仍上課如常。</p>
<p>幼師</p>
<p>國產幼師，昨日復有中華職校，中華工專兩校學生卅餘人，至該校宣傳罷課，當時情形略有紛亂，致該校無形停課。</p>

<p>同德</p>
<p>同德醫學院反罷課委員會，今日發刋快報，由明某報昨登該校學生自治會消息，純屬虛揑，蓋該校素無自治會之組織。該校昨除少二三十同學缺課外，其餘照常上課。</p>
<p>中德</p>
<p>中德助產學校，今日全體復課。</p>
<p>華光</p>

<p>南通</p>

<h3>展開普及民衆敎育的突擊戰</h3>
<p>— 陳鶴琴</p>
<p>這個年頭，甚麼事情等不及你挨步就班的做了！</p>
<p>一切要快，要加緊去做，加速度完成它，用上一個鍾頭的工夫就要完成需要加倍時間的工作，這才是時間的經濟，人力的經濟，一切合乎經濟的原則。</p>
<p>本市這一次舉辦普及民衆敎育的工作，當局的意思就是想在一個相當時間內使全市民衆包括成人與兒童人人識字，這顯然是一個嘗試，我們不能否認，事實上亦無法否認這是一件比較艱鉅的工作。但，參加工作的同人大家都已經在做了，誰都很樂意的接受了這個「神聖而又偉大」的任務。</p>
<p>所謂要在一個相當時間內完成本市民衆人人識字工作的「相當時間」，毫無疑問的是指一個不很太長太久的時間，因爲，事實上我們已經沒有很多的時間，很多的人力物力財力來從事這樁工作。這意思就是說要我們在「一切經濟」的原則下加速度的展開這個普及民衆敎育的運動。</p>
<p>受敎育是每個國民應有的權利，同樣的，敎不識字的人亦是我們每個識字人應盡的義務。我很自信，而且我想大家都能自信，要不識字的人識字，敎不識字的人識字，一定是彼此樂意，相互歡喜，問題就在於怎樣才能快！快而有效！</p>
<p>這是方法問題，也就是關於技術上的問題，不過，這裏所謂「快」，並不是亂，而是一種有規律的合理的快。</p>
<p>就先從施敎方式說起：</p>
<p>第一，不拘形式，換句話說，舊的那一套並不是一定要用，像過去開辦班級的方式，或者設校制度，因爲這種固定的方式，容易使受敎人感到枯燥無味，以至興趣索然。</p>
<p>第二，方式要多，能隨機應變，時常變換，使學習與生活打成一片，担保至少可有七八成把握的成功。</p>
<p>第三，要儘量利用「即知即敎」的方法。</p>
<p>這裏我願意推荐「傳遞敎學法」，或者「識字連環」，這就是一種把敎育送上門去的方法，不僅可以避免「班級敎學」所發生的困難，而且可以擴大班級的敎學，使敎育連環或者傳遞的擴展開來，旣普遍而又深入。比方說我担任敎學四個民衆，那四個民衆把我所敎的再敎別人，這樣傳遞的敎授下去，不愁這種普及民衆敎育的工作沒有不完成的一天，不過使用這種方法有一些地方是需要注意的：</p>
<p>（一）第一批担任敎學者，一定要切實的了解所敎的東西。</p>
<p>（二）施敎人同受敎人，一定是彼此相互建立在感情上面的。</p>
<p>（三）要使這些施敎人同受敎人時常有機會集合在一起。</p>
<p>（四）要訂定考核的辦法，如何測量施敎人與受敎人</p>
<p>（五）課程，時間，方式，一切是好由施敎人與受敎人，共同訂定，共同遵守。</p>
<p>把敎育送上門去，確實是推行民衆敎育最確當有效的辦法。不怕不識字的人不要，只愁識字的人不做，希望這次發動全市知識份子（包括小學高年級以上學生，學校敎職員，商店店員，每戶識字朋友），參加工作，特別能注重寗願我們犧牲一點，把敎育送上門去，送到每一個不識字朋友的面前去。我們要把傳遞敎學的方式推行到全市每一個角落去。要完成密佈四處的識字網，沒有一個不識字的人能逃過這一陣。</p>
<p>如果爲鼓勵這種方式，我建議不妨化一點錢，做一些可以標識的紀念物，如徽章等，每一個參加工作的人無論是施敎人同受敎人，大家都有，或者以每敎一個民衆便有一種符號，學生愈多，身上的紀念東西也加多。</p>
<p>再講施敎內容同授課時間：</p>
<p>第一，當然先從識字敎育做起，過去那些民衆課本能用的就用，不適用的改了再用，最好編訂一套大概以日常應用到的一千個字爲範圍的課本，一面絨用，一面修改，科目不在乎多，唱歌却不可少。</p>
<p>第二，這次舉辦普及民衆敎育工作一定要顧到民衆的負祖，至少我們不能妨礎他的工作，所以授課時間必須斟酌情形，予以减少，在學期限亦可酌予縮短。比方說，平常一星期要上六個晚上的課，現在我們不妨試用，每星期上三個晚上的課，星期一二三，或者星期二四六，這樣成人與婦女可以輪流受敎，不僅經濟時間，而又經濟空間。</p>
<p>第三，儘量利用有敎育意義的活動，以增加學習興趣。</p>
<p>第四，單用課本一定不够，應當編印千字報紙一類的補充讀物，灌輸世界大事及日常生活知</p>
<p>關於組織機構方面，愈簡化愈好辦，由下而上容易收效，所以第一，一定要配合行政設施，透過行政組織，要加强展開這個運動。區公所同保甲組織，是最大最好的助力。第二，各推進區應該是主持推進策動的機構，如果單靠這個機構工作的確不大很够。最好能以保爲賞施單位，各保普遍成立保普及民衆敎育促進會一類組織，由保長保幹事及保內各學校校長，担任委員，負責籌劃執行，前者是個設計考核指導機構，而後者却是執行機構。</p>
<p>給從事這個神聖而又偉大的工作同人一種鼓勵，亦是必要的。我們果無法在物質方面提出怎麼樣的要求，但，精神上的鼓勵那是應該的，比方說，爲鼓勵學生參加，不妨請求各學校儘量設置免費額，或請社會熱心人士捐助獎學金，爲獎勵參加這個工作的教育界同人，由當局規定一種辦法，使凡是參加工作的，到相當時間就一律提高其薪額幾分之幾，或者舉辦集體旅行，或者分贈各大電影院戲券，或者在大日報公開宣揚，或者擇優由市長局長等長官，定期召見，這都是些辦法，一切可隨時決定。</p>
<p>參加這個工作就等於參加一次戰鬥！身爲一個戰鬥員，必須要有十二萬分的自信，十二萬分的勇氣，再加上十二萬分的毅力，才能把握着勝利。這次戰鬥只許勝利，不許失敗！我們應該把握住時機，加速度的展開普及民衆敎育的突擊戰！</p>
<h3>浙省各民衆團體　勸在學青年復課　並要求政府負責維持秩序</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州廿四日電〕浙省各民衆團體，頃發出吿各學校同學書，略謂：此次學潮起因，純係在學靑年，對於當前敎育設施之改進改善，有所請願與建議，動機純正，目標簡明，社會輿論，多寄同情。不料事態演變，趨於複雜而廣大，情感近於偏激，行動走向極端，遂陷於不可收拾地步，公共秩序，爲之解體，社會人心爲之動搖，各界人士往日所寄與之同情，將一變而爲今日之反感。此殆大多數純潔靑年始料之所不及，抑亦一般身爲學生家長者寤寐所不安。文中並要求政府負責維持秩序，確保治安之神聖責任，要求在學靑年，即日復課，加緊充實國家圖强之眞實學問，以建設社會，建設國家。</p>

<h3>巨人亦告敗北　征輪六戰六勝　四七比四十保持常勝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕洛陽遠征軍征輪籃球隊，繼續保持其勝利記錄，昨晚又擊敗西僑勁旅巨人隊，比數四十七比四十分，上半時征輪以廿三比十四佔先。征輪六戰六勝，市體育館。內並不因風雨交加减少興　，依然人氣狂熱，球迷約計二千，爲征　比賽初見盛况，門票計售出一千二百九十張，無票捧塲者亦不在少數，足見征輪今非昔比，號召力殊可觀也。賽前並有市長盃幼級組第一次決賽，中法後來居上，廿五比二十勝綠傑。</p>
<p>發揮神射</p>
<p>征輪昨晚仍發揮其神射，益以天賦獨厚，前鋒平均發展，雖傳遞聯絡，尙未登峯造極，但年來之苦練，已有相當之收獲，凶猛之互人，終於低首下心，再遭屈服。巨人浮尼克，征輪作戰，無塲不到，冷眼旁觀，但昨晚仍被征輪壓倒，從此西靑兄弟團均吿敗北，遠征，之雄風，不可一世。屠文龍於下半時方出手，于瑞章蔡忠强互相媲美，劉王把守稱職，巨人以浮尼克耶龍陶勃令基三人最凶，陣綫亦頻頻調動，下半時雖反攻猛烈，較征輪多二分，但無法挽救大局。</p>
<p>志在必得</p>
<p>巨人隊員分二批到塲，計時負的喇叭，七時一刻方嚮，裁判員瞿鴻律劉荷生，陶勃令基接蔡忠强征輪隊贈旗，雙方陣綫：巨人陶勃令基，强杜萊，浮尼克，耶龍，N沙司金，征輸仍以五虎先上塲，于瑞章，蔡忠强，屠文龍，劉政軍，王秉煥。N沙司金因于瑞章之犯規，上塲即罰中一分，耶龍王秉煥均罰球未中，於右角投入，四座球迷呌好不絕，屠文龍雖有浮尼克「板門」阻住，卒扔中籃，强社萊浮尼克支持局面，奈子瑞章蔡忠强之得手，十分鍾內，成十比五相差一倍。蔡與浮尼克前後媲美，屠文龍單臂又成得意劇作，十五比九時，旋捷密洛夫易出耶龍，征輪因志在必得，過份緊張，　　犯規，且又輒逢善射之浮尼克。十七比十四，耶龍調强杜萊，同時巨人作第三次暫停，于屠蔡各有建樹，回觀巨人則一籌漠展，上半時成廿三比十四，遠征軍以九分領前。</p>
<p>巨人低頭</p>
<p>十分鐘，休息再戰，凱捷密洛夫替浮尼克，于瑞章出人頭地，耶龍陶勃令基增三分，廿五比十七浮尼克强杜萊交替，陶及耶龍猛追成廿七比廿二，愈追愈近，浮尼克籃下摸索未得，于蔡頓添兩球，V開羅斯易旋捷密洛夫，與耶龍兩人屢獲空心球，安知屠文能亦爲順手，後因與浮尼克相爭，被罰離塲，時比數爲四十四比三十。最後四分鐘爲四十六比三十四，耶龍托進N沙司金「畢業」，强杜萊又下塲，兩軍相持更凶，四分鐘轉瞬完畢，四十七比四十，征輪又勝第六戰。正泰橡膠廠贈征輪全體隊員新球鞋各一雙，該隊稱昨晚得力不少。</p>

<h3>幼級盃決賽　中法勝綠傑</h3>
<p>幼級盃決賽第一戰，中法勝緣傑，第一節綠傑沈堯雍最靈活，獨進三球，綠傑以十一比七佔優勢。第二節雙方防綫鞏固，俱難突破，中法一分，綠傑三分，上半時綠傑十四，中法八分。第三節中法奮起，三擲一罰，綠隊僅賴史濟林得三分，惟絲傑仍以十七比十五領前，末節小將們咬緊牙關，中法費建星一球，反以十八比十七超出一分，史濟林二罰球中其一，成十八平手。中法吳正康又罰中，再度追出一分，中鋒李胥森截球探籃，連中二球，綠傑史一球，鍾解響處，中法吳正康遠中，以廿五比二十，經最後之努力，第一戰壓倒綠傑。</p>

<h3>論征輪勝巨區　動作快捷·投籃可靠</h3>
<p>以巨人昨夕上塲陣容，征輪應該輕易取勝；陷入苦戰，實出意外。</p>
<p>征輪制勝主要原因，在動作快捷，針對巨人的弱點所在，使對方祇有追隨之力。</p>
<p>論全隊默契工夫，互人超過征輪；且互人努力獲奪籃下球，賴浮尼克與陶勃林基之穩健，局面遂形均衡。下半時比數一度成爲二十八比二十四。</p>
<p>征輪防守嚴密，球一落入敵手，全隊立即回師退守，這種動作的敏捷，全滬無出其右。</p>
<p>屠文龍的神射，稍失常態，但于瑞章和蔡忠强則大顯身手。征輪有三個射手，一個失常，影響還不大，照幾塲比賽下來，征輪的射中率，可以說穩定在一個相當高的水準上，這扔然是克敵制勝的可靠條件。</p>
<p>征輪各人都有可驚的膂力，他們出手投籃所取地點，平均要比一般球隊爲遠，觀衆雖然看不慣，其實這正是他們佔便宜的地方，他們無須計誘突入敵方防綫，必要時就可在敵陣之外擲籃，初次觀戰，還當作他們在「碰運氣」，但是，他們的命中率，却吿訴你，不必懷疑。（昌年）</p>

<h3>華股人心堅穩　永紗趨勢挺秀</h3>
<p>華股昨人心因多空携手之訊，而吿堅穩。永紗屢次漲越八千元大關，但交易不多，俏後易回。雜牌股漲停者亦有，僅中法情况惡劣，由漲停退至跌停。華豐新股準下週一上塲，遞交須週四開做。</p>
<p>晨開人心頗好，均開高　，遞永紗開後，二二四號四五號一八三號一〇五號進胃尙殷，自七六五〇元升至七九五〇元，一〇四號一六號二〇七號二一八號四七號一九一號賣到七八〇〇元內，二二四號八九號九四號二一八號三五號二三五號九五號來進，中絲美亞景福中法漲停，永紗升為八千元，一四三號二二三號一一九號脫手，退為七八八〇元。二三五號八九號七七號二三七號二一九號來進，水泥大通漲停，永紗升至八〇三〇元左右，八五號二二四號七七號四八號來賣，中法在大衆見棄中，慘吿跌停。遞永紗亦退至七九〇〇元內，二三一號力購，檯面乾涸，遞永紗漲達八一〇〇元新高價。六一號六五號二二四號一九七號二二號脫手，近午跌至七八〇〇元，一三四號六二號七六號一五五號一九七號進至八千元外，一六號力售，午收又退至七九一〇元，收後喊高少許。結果較前收計永紗信和美亞景福新華各漲半成，新光永公勤興徽升，中法再跌半成强，大通漲一成强，中絲升一成不到，中紡國貨景綸平平，新亞微降，水泥榮豐火業各升半成迄一成弱不等，商務跌半成。遞交計永紗信和永公勤興各升半成弱，美亞漲半成强，新光景福微升，塲外各老股漲跌俱微。</p>
<h3>統債升沉微細</h3>
<p>公債昨十分平庸，漲跌更微。統內晨開一三八〇〇元，自一三六〇〇元起，盤高至一四一〇〇元，最後在一三九〇〇元左右　徊。四〇八室五五二室五五五室俱納，三六〇室則出，結果較前收計丙戊平平，甲乙丁各升二三百元，成交六百萬左右。</p>
<h3>外股市況平庸</h3>
<p>外股昨散買及證券幫受金價影響，而具買胃。北幫之供給有限，各股咸吿回漲，惟過程平庸，起仆有限。怡紗晨開七萬三。即吿盤好至七萬五，臨收稍盤，結果較前收計會德豐，怡啤，鋼業，電話，墾植，開平微升，業廣平平，怡啤，英聯，紙業，航業，各升半成。</p>
<h3>人絲堅俏　成交不多</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲又吿堅挺，一二〇號高山有光始終在一千八百萬元左右盤旋，最後仍　八百萬元收盤。下午喊週一期八百三十萬元，即期又比上日大二十萬元。七五號半光仍喊二千六百萬元，但乏人過問，並無做開。</p>
<p>昨市廠經較上日更寂，只做開C字等級價二千萬元，E字等級亦有五包交易，價做一千九百四十萬元，餘貨只有喊價，俱比上日稍短。干經另担次者討價一千四百五十萬元，殊乏成交。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨塲內傳來利買消息，故眞絲被面及格子璧縐皆告上升。美亞被面喊八百五十萬元，不過未曾做開。大誠格子　　，開市喊三萬一千元，最後升至一千五百元收市，比上日大起一千三百元。其餘各貨，類皆堅站未動。</p>
<h3>中蠶公司決定　部份讓與民營</h3>
<p>中國蠶絲公司，為經濟農林兩部所合辦農業性質兼工業性質之機構，讓歸民營，早經政院決定。茲悉：該公司業已奉到部令，開始籌辦讓與辦法，茲已原則決定。其農業部份，帶有推廣性之業務，如桑園·桑苗·製種等，仍歸國營。而絹紡廠製絲廠織綢廠等，有關工業之生產部門，　與民營。此項工業部門，平時已有盈餘，即其中百分之五十發行股票，百分之五十仍由國營。聞中蠶公司對發行股票辦法，業已擬定，呈部核示中。故中蠶公司前途，乃一官民合營之生產機構</p>
<h3>捲烟行行見好</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况稍形挺秀，客家略有拖進，兼聞烟稅於明（廿六日）起，有實施調整之說，廠盤恐將變更，是以塲中進取者頗衆，行情遂搏趨堅挺。</p>
<p>十支大英牌烟晨開價即好五萬元，為七百二十萬元，交易不弱，旋步升至卅二萬元間徘徊，午收時微回為卅萬元。</p>
<p>下午因週六關係，交易略懈。大信公司及上海烟行，又有託派捲烟之訊，人心趨軟，十支大英烟喊價比上午回小三萬元，最後為七百廿七萬元，較之上日軋升十二萬元。老刀則降一萬五千元，其餘華商條烟大多微升。</p>
<p>又訊：聽頭香烟上午市氣萎靡，同業進取式微，價鮮變化。午後塲中略有添補，市稍回挺。結果三五牌比上日軋升一千五百元，茄力克好一千元，小南米小三砲等，亦漲自五百元至一千元左右。</p>
<p>派烟消息</p>
<p>大信菸業俊司　託公會舉辦普派白馬立斯香烟，不論何等級別會員，每家各派廿支包裝之白馬立斯捲烟五條，價每條三萬五千元。規定會員繳款日期，於廿七日以前，須將領派貨款，送交本組組長處，彙繳公會核轉。各區組長繳款日期，定分區繳解，以免擁擠。定廿八日為一·二·三·四·區，各組長繳款日期，廿九日為五·六·七·八·區各組長繳款日期，由各組長將所收貨款及單表，彙繳聚興誠銀行。</p>
<p>上海菸行昨亦委託公會，辦理著派會員同行吉士牌香烟，聞每家得派五條，派價每條為三萬六千元，繳款日期與白馬立斯同。</p>
<h3>皂燭原料銷旺　月牌燒碱回升</h3>

<p>昨日用品中之肥皂市面亦趨挺秀，蓋因業中人不乏見低吸收，更以週六關係，做開有隔日票據之作用，賣戶吐售，而買戶方面亦不示弱，喊價乃呈堅昂之勢。下午最後固本皂每箱價為卅六萬八千元，箭刀皂為卅五萬七千元，均比上日軋升四千元，其他各牌平定。火柴美麗牌每籍軋升三萬元，為二百五十八萬元。鳳凰牌升二萬元，為二百六十萬元。金城升五千元，其餘南京老虎等牌，則鮮變化。</p>
<h3>國行否認發行　平行綫本票</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近市上盛傳中央銀行將發行所謂平行綫支票，或定額本票等說。據該行負責人談稱：外間所傳，絕無其事。惟最近政府辦理收購春繭貸款，為應農村需要，平價配售布疋，原擬如農民需要購布者得予以本票，憑以提貨。嗣為避免輾轉手續，仍決定逕發布疋提單，不用本票，外間誤傳，或係出此。</p>
<h3>食米漲勢未戢　市塲幾入停頓狀態　僅碾秈白元略有交晚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市因連日陰雨，到貨極稀，又以產區價格繼續上挺，致市塲無法決定價格，昨南北兩市塲幾全成停市狀態。南市堪到貨一九七九石，做碾秈白元兩檔略有交易。碾秈中貨喊價卅三萬元。白元中貨喊價卅九萬五千元。北市塲到貨一六〇三石五斗，交易亦甚稀少。白粳站穩卅八萬五千元，薄稻卅七萬五千元，早稻卅六萬元，羊秈卅五萬元，碾秈卅三萬元，埠秈卅四萬元</p>
<p>麵粉受米價刺激，亦見上挺。昨洋粉無市，本粉喊十二萬元，麩皮七萬一千元。食油價格亦大漲，較上日昇起數萬元。</p>
<p>麩皮狂漲五六千元，豆餅買氣濃旺，飛升四五千元。黃豆跟漲五六千至萬元不一。菉豆依然平疲，赤豆堅挺，苞米靑島納胃　懈，價形漲定，紅糧步挺三五千元，生仁芝蔴均見挺進萬元。　豆新貨將到，市形平正。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日米店雖照常開門，惟若干米店高白粳每擔竟喊達四十三萬，米櫃存米亦吿减少。警備司令部宣司令昨令各警察分局，轉各米號及米塲，勸吿米商顧及民食，抑平市價。</p>
<p>工廠配燮規定手續</p>
<p>社會局對配售工廠米糧規定領取手續如下：</p>
<p>（一）經社局審核以核准配量通知書，交各廠向指定銀行繳款，換取提米證。</p>
<p>（二）指定銀行為市銀行</p>
<p>（三）憑提米證向轉糧食部上海總倉庫提取。</p>
<p>（四）配價白粳每石廿四萬元，西貢十六萬八千元，下週二通知書開始發出。</p>
<p>據稱糧食部對本市配米，擬以半數或三分之一搭配碎米，配價將次於西貢米云。</p>
<p>又訊：市府昨日下午三時，召集有關各方，商討貧民配米辦法。據市府葛參事提議，平賣處可由民意機關會同慈善機關辦理，因直接由社局辦理，或有隔膜之處云。</p>
<h3>利買消息濃厚　紗價一致挺升　棉布客幫進意活躍</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因利買空氣濃厚，兼證劵止昂，人心頗堅。四二支藍鳳一千二百三十萬元喊開，津粵等幫實需開展，業外商人乘勢附和，塲中新買增多，致價步挺，至最後為一千二百五十萬元，比上日猛漲五十萬元。廿支特雙馬，由六百九十萬元做開，頻升至七百三十萬元，亦跟漲十五萬元。其餘各支扯升二三十萬元不等。</p>
<p>又訊：昨棉布開市，因平行綫本票發行謠傳，刺激人心，塲中賣戶踟蹰，客帮則進意活躍，本街亦有吸收，行情逐吿哄上。十二磅龍頭細布由卅萬零三千喊開，至最後為卅一萬元，比上日激升一萬二千元。五福藍鷄彩球等細布，亦漲自七八千元至一萬元左右。嗶嘰金蓮妙舞跳鯉及四君干，跟好八千元至一萬一千元。其他低檔士林布及藍布元布潔布斜紋等，一律上升四五千元至一二萬元不一。</p>
<p>紡建公司昨照例開售布疋，白坯龍頭細布掛牌為廿九萬八千元，漂布四君子卅一萬七千元，申請者甚為踴躍。聞龍頭細布准購單加價五千元，有人吸進。</p>
<p>紡建普查配紗單位</p>
<p>中國紡織建設公司，為明瞭最近工商業變動情形，舉行「普查」經常配紗之二千五百三十三單位營業近况，是否有無轉讓，甚至倒閉等事，以決定重新配紗之數量。聞是項普查工作，本月底即可正式吿一段落。</p>
<p>又外間盛傳中紡拒絕配紗予各新廠一事，據中紡施專員稱：並無其事，本公司日來因集中力量，忙於普查，故暫時停止新廠之登記，一俟普查完畢後，在下月一日，各新廠即可依照本公司辦法，請求配紗登記云。</p>
<h3>各地均告豐收　春繭估達九萬擔　蠶絲產銷協導會昨開會</h3>

<p>（甲）重要報吿：（一）核定貸款廠商六十六家，已送請中國農民銀行核貸繭款，尙有國華等五家，在趕補手續中。其經核定之收繭量，合乾繭五萬六千祖，連同合作社乾繭四千担，共為六萬担。</p>

<h3>香港頒怖　出口新辦法</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港廿四日電〕港政府鑒於出口商所得外匯，多不交政府核配，而以紐約銀行匯票在黑市出售，故於今日頒佈新辦法，規定出口商於聲請對美洲大陸及菲律賓之出口執照時，須簽字陳明其出口所得外匯，將交給在聲請書內所書明之某一銀行，否則出口執照將不予發給。據悉：港政府將向外匯銀行協會會員，提出下列建議：（一）向該銀行在貨物目的地之支行或代表先行付款，或於接獲自港啓運之運輸單後，即行付款。（二）以交貨國貨幣或英格蘭銀行註册英磅匯票支付。</p>
<h3>合作綢廠開工</h3>
<p>政府為安插後方工人，前曾讓渡敵偽之慶德，江商，久寳三綢廠，在社會局工商輔導處，及中蠶公司全國合作供銷處輔導之下，成立勞資織綢機構，定名合作綢廠，資本為一億元。中蠶撥提倡股三千萬元，合作供銷處提倡股兩千萬元，餘歸勞方，並於三月廿日舉行創立會，地址設虹口全家庵路。經修復後，擁有專織外銷綢緞機台一百座，原料則取自絲織品產銷聯營公司，中蠶名下台機一百座應得之數。原擬早日開廠製造，惟因接電費時，延至昨日始行開工。按目前每日九小時電力，僅足供三十台織造花色綢十五匹之需，與開支預算仍難抵償云。</p>
<h3>國家行局明日起　調整各地滙率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四行兩局一庫內匯業務第三十九次小組會，於昨日下午，在中央銀行業務局舉行，討論經過，決議自五月廿六日起，調整以下各地匯率：</p>

<p>又昨日各商業銀行內匯率，亦見下跌。重慶自五元至十五元，廣州自三〇元至九五元，厦門一百元，漢口三〇元至六〇元，西安二〇元，昆明二〇元至四〇元，長沙四〇元至六〇元。</p>
<h3>各地利率調查　杭州天津為最高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央銀行稽核處發表，全國各重要城市利率調查表，以下各城市，利率有如表示：（每千元）</p>
<h3>台糖存底充沛　食糖黑市漸消滅　大批砂糖即將由台運滬</h3>
<p>台糖公司成立迄今，始終遵守社會局限價配售食糖，據該公司負責人談稱：本市食糖黑市迄今已全部消滅，目前該公司配糖政策，盡可能提高配價，而將配額盡量加多。各糖商旣配得充分之食糖，毋庸再向黑市購買，黑市交易已逐漸消減。</p>
<p>現存糖在六十萬包以上，絕對充沛週前並已與招商局商妥，租用海平，海滬，海隴，三輪，專程駛基隆運糖。據估計該三艘巨輪，可載萬噸砂糖，及一千包冰糖，本月底即可運抵滬地。</p>
<p>此外該公司為擴充業務，下月起特關袋裝糖部份。該項袋裝糖分五磅及十磅二種，將委託各大百貨商店代為零售，其價格仍較市價為低云。</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平穩，上落互見。公會劃盤，秘魯砂初疲後緊，價為四十萬〇五千元至九千元，後為四十一萬二千元，好起四千元。二〇中砂白仍為三十七萬元，三半車白，號家開一百包，三十八萬元。提靑回籠貨劃二十六萬五千元至三千元，小五千元。順德靑開數十包，二十五萬五千元，降度相同。刁靑零星開二十四萬元，興化白三十八萬元，興赤二十八萬元，成交不上百件。</p>
<h3>被黜糖商獲准復配</h3>
<p>本市七十餘家糖商，自被台糖公司認為不合規定，取消配糖權利以後，當由該業公會，商准台糖公司，重予覆查，以恤商艱。茲聞此項工作，業於上週間宣吿完成，且經日來愼密審核結果，認為其中二十餘家，內部組織尙可，姑念商艱，先予恢復小額配糖資格，以觀後效。至於其餘五十餘家，為免遺珠起見，決於下週一日起再行第三次調查，以示慎重。</p>
<h3>茶商請求　收購茶葉</h3>
<p>國行轉請四聯總處核辦</p>
<p>茶商以茶葉外銷困難，特請中央銀行貸款收購，由中茶　營公司統一外銷，此項請求文件，昨已送到中央銀行。據中央銀行負責當局表示：對於茶商困難，極表同情，決予扶助，將來能否如茶商希望，則不得而知，因此事尙須經四聯總處會議核辦。</p>
<p>據悉：中央銀行本年初，以財部不能負担收購茶葉之盈虧，特與中國農民銀行洽商，允加做茶葉押款。當時預定以新茶押款價格八折為標準，祁紅為四十八萬，屯綠四十萬，平綠三十二萬，最近茶價變動，收購價格，茶商方面，希予提高，以上列價格，加上五月來之費用，作為極低之收購價，盈虧請政府負責，如未荷允准，將另謀補救辦法。</p>
<p>又訊：向受南北美洲垂靑之平水大帮，昨日市上，午昌茶葉公司對於三十五年度花色，雖有垂詢，但出價異常苛刻，每担堅持四十萬元左右，而貨方則因成本關係，不忍割愛，是以交易依然陷於停頓。其他各茶，仍無人問津，市勢遂猶沈靜，脚地虛浮如故。至於各種內銷茶，變動殊為微利，在有求必供中，人心至為穩定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕天祥洋行海門特號，今日離滬赴歐，裝茶葉六千六百箱運法，棉籽油二百七十桶遲西班牙，棉紗七十件運博賽，又棉紗二百件運哈定。</p>

<h3>惠州：革命的名城</h3>
<p>— 廣州廿一日航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>惠州——這個革命的名城，相信凡對近代史或者中國英侖史稍有研究的人，對她大致不會感到是個陌生的地方吧。大約自宋朝起，這地方便巳給人發現，因爲宋神宗時，以文章書晝名著天下的蘇私（東坡）學士，與王安石議論不合，就是被貶到這個惠州城來，他在這裏度過了一個時期，終日以詩酒自娛的逍遙歲月，曾創作了不少爲後人傳誦的不朽的詩篇，所以這地方也就因人的關係，而從此負了盛名。到了民國以後，由於山川靈秀所鑲，她更曾孕育了不少革侖的志士，先烈廖仲愷·鄧仲元·兩先生，便是誕生於此。尤其在民國十四年間，所謂黃埔學生軍東征之役，就是在這裏寫上革命史上光輝燦爛的一頁，而從此奠定了革命的基礎，所以這座曾經發射着革命光芒的名城，更成爲千秋百世後人所景仰的勝地了。</p>
<p>這次因爲馬鞍圍落成的機會，記者隨羅卓英主席和一班同業，隊了觀光馬鞍圍的偉大水利工程之外，還在這革命勝地作兩日之遊，可算是一件非常愉快的事。</p>
<p>飛鵝嶺天然屏障</p>
<p>我們自廣州乘火車出發，沿廣九鐵路走了約摸兩個鐘頭左右，在中站樟木頭下車，那裏有一條與火車站連接，由樟木頭至惠陽的樟惠公路；這公路續跨東莞惠陽兩縣，全長既十三公里，有公共汽車載客往來，收費也不算貴，全程每位祇收八千元；路面尙見平坦，沿途風景亦佳，田野山林，蒼翠悅目。我們車子行了個把鐘頭左右，便見前面巍然矗立着一座雄偉的高山，這就是史上著名的飛鵝嶺，她是惠州城西邊的天然屏障，形勢險要，歷來欲從陸路取惠州的軍隊，必須奪得此一據點，然後可居高臨下，控制全城，故所謂兵家必爭之地。我們從這飛鵝嶺山麓繞過，不數分鐘，便已抵達目的地，這座革命名城的外號，以及歷史上有名的惠州西湖全景，都已完全收進眼底了。</p>
<p>惠州城面江枕山</p>
<p>「惠州」，這僅是宋朝至淸朝時的府治名稱，民國後即劃入惠陽縣，所以惠州城也即是現在的惠陽城，不過因爲歷史的關係致一般人現在還呌她做惠州城吧了。我們翻開地圖來看，便知這惠陽是南中國一個濱海的縣份，位處粵省東江下游，面江枕山，形勢天成，一向是廣州外圍的重鎭，抗戰時日軍南侵，便首先在該縣的大亞灣登陸，藉此向廣州進迫，當地軍民，奮起抗敵，惠州城前後得失凡四次，這便可看到這地方的重要。到勝科後，粵省四區行政專員公暑，也乙設在這惠州城內，因爲在此可守望南海東江以保衛廣州，而現在城內的專員公署，也就是前淸廣東陸路提督府的故址，我們在專署的大禮堂屋頂一條正樑上，看到刻着有「大淸同治十年署廣東陸路提督軍門陽江總鎭府幹勇巴圖魯衛佐邦重修」等字樣，像這樣一個全省最高的軍事機關，當時不設在廣州而設惠州，也可見他並沒有忽略這地方的軍事價値了。</p>
<p>訪豐湖世外桃源</p>
<p>我們在這次旅行中，最使人依戀的就是惠州的西湖。她是本省著名的風景區之一。據史所載：她原名豐湖，因在郡西，人亦呼爲西湖，風景與武林相似。但是當地的人士都說：杭州西湖不過是人工裝飾之美，惠州西湖才特具天然之勝。這說法雖似近於自炫，但她畢竟不失爲一個遊玩的好所在。我們一葉扁舟，湖心泛棹，湖光山色，盡入眼簾。其中有「百花洲」，「芳草洲」，「留丹亭」，「孝子亨」，「玄妙觀」，以及「雁塔斜暉」，「紅棉水榭」等，都的確是別具天然風緻的名勝。記者在兩天內凡三訪西湖，有一次竟是在黃昏之後，這時萬籟俱寂，夜凉似水。我們仰臥舟中，遙觀星斗，靜聽虫鳴，更是別有一番滋味哩。</p>

<p>湖上有「蘇隄」，據說就是蘇東坡所建。當他被貶在惠州時，曾買此爲放生池，築隄障水，所以後人便名之曰「蘇隄」。以外，尙有一個是蘇東坡妾侍的「朝雲墓」，這也是一個著名的地方。墓地是淸嘉慶年間郡守伊秉綬重修，現在還不算十分陳舊，碑上刻有「蘇文忠公侍妾王氏朝雲之墓」等字樣，四園更有不少歷史名人所題的碑銘，墓門有兩對頗堪一誦的對聯，一是：「從南海來時，經卷藥爐，百尺江樓飛柳絮；自東坡去後，夜燈仙塔，一亭明月冷梅花」。是出自光緒時陳維的手筆。另一是光緒徐琪的；「香塚尙如生，尺地足爲山水重；玉脊淸不寐，半天時有珮環來。」讀後不禁使人對這位浪漫不羈的東坡學士發生艷羨，而對這位侖薄的朝雲女士，寄予無限的同情。</p>
<p>五眼橋革命史蹟</p>
<p>在湖的北端，有一道呌五眼橋，旁邊豎立一枝並不很高的紀念碑，這就是黃埔軍攻城的紀念碑。在這裏有着一段非常壯烈的革侖史蹟：綠民國十一年間，陳烱明在粵叛變，藉惠州作根據地，圖窺廣州；當時，國父曾遺兵征剿，惟屢攻不克。直至民國十四年，始由蔣主席（當時是參謀）親自指揮黃埔軍校的學生軍，苦戰一月，卒佔據了飛鵝嶺。但當時城內守軍實力尙强，據城頑抗，而該城四面皆水，與城接通的祗有一道五眼橋。守軍以重兵堅守此一通道，使攻城的黃埔革侖軍蒙了莫大的損失，團長劉耀宸即陣亡於此。後來　蔣主席下了最大決心，鼓起三軍餘勇，在澎湃的革命熱情驅使之下：不惜冒險犯難，勇敢犧牲，終於衝過了五眼橋，以人疊梯，爬上城墻，堅强的守軍，便一擊而散，從此國民革命軍便奠定了不拔的基礎，完成了歷史上偉大的任務。當地一位曾經參加過黃花崗之役的革侖老人梁鏡球先生，對我們縷述這一役革命軍攻城的情形，更說得有聲有色，他們那種偉大的犧牲精神，眞敎人無限敬佩。相信現在負着軍政重任的高級長官，不少是曾參加是役的，羅卓英將軍便是其中的一個，不過羅主席說：他當時才是一個下級的砲兵幹部哩</p>
<p>集散地商業鼎盛</p>
<p>我們在游湖興畫之餘，也曾對這名城的各方面作過簡略的訪問。她除了是一個歷史名勝和軍事重地之外，還有着相當的經濟價値，因她位於東江下游，當潮汕入省之衝，東江上游的貨物，都以此爲集散場所，商賈雲集，商業亦至茂感。城裏有旅館約二三十家，都幾乎經常給各地來採辦貨物的商人住滿，這裏市塲的熱鬧，便可想見。而且，該縣港灣極多，如能大量開發那裏的漁業監業，相信對粵省經濟發展更有不少的助力。當地敎育亦頗發達，全縣計有中學十間，小學三百八十六所，學生三萬七千餘人。至治安方面，這是當地一個嚴重的問題；因以前共軍的所謂東江縱隊，就是集結於該縣的坪山一帶，自從「北撤」以後，殘部以土匪面目，四出據人搶劫，爲害地方。最近該隊的頭目曾生潛返後，更作較有計劃的行動，破壞政令，阻撓糧政役政，搗亂市塲，騷擾佳村，百姓不勝其苦，雖然現在坐鎭那裏的四區行政專員黃錚將軍，他是一位當有軍事經騐的老將，在他撫勦兼施之下，較有組織的股匪多被解決，目前地方上大致也可以說得上較前寗靖，但零星敵匪，到處騷擾，還是時有發現，所以東江的治安問題，雖然不算十分嚴重，但也不能說是完全沒有問題吧。</p>

<h3>東北共軍實力幾保　妄向長春外圍發動全面攻勢</h3>
<p>— 長春十日航訊　本報記者趙展</p>
<p>共軍在東北蓄意下一注賭本，早已昭然若揭。今年春天，牠發動了四次大規模的南犯，犧牲十分慘重！據估計勤員廿萬人，損失約五萬人以上，其中有些是很精說的部隊。共軍雖屢遭失敗的打擊，但其心未死，在三月中至四月上旬，由　華特指揮的吉淸綫柳河等地之戰事，可說是共軍在春季試探性騷擾的尾聲，迄今仍有小規模的竄擾，不久或將發展出新攻勢，也說不定。</p>
<p>共軍是以面積遼闊地形複雜的「北滿」作基地，指揮司令合在哈爾濱，兵工廠在佳木斯。在吉林東部及安東北部，吉淸綫以東地區，共軍藉長白山脈爲掩護，時作牽制的擾亂，北面可以呼應松北，南面可以接通大連，西面直向國軍的鋒腰，地形頗爲優越，唯兵力脆弱。自吉林東面的老爺嶺起，沿第二松花江至農安西北的王府，國共南北隔江對峙。松花江開凍以後，共軍即無力再作正面南犯，因此共軍主力移至長春農安以西地區，在長洮路以西，由大賣扶餘而南，共軍集結於乾安，長嶺，遼源，爲數約七八個師。最近，並由哈埠運新兵至扶餘，搶修大　至王府之鐵道，有明顯之跡象可以判斷共軍將由西面向長春四平發動攻勢。</p>
<p>四平防守工作堅強</p>
<p>第五區綏靖司令官陳明仁說：「共軍將以四平爲目標。」並很坦白的說明，四平的防守工作已經做得很好。共軍在這方面的軍事負責人呂正操，由遼源沿新遼河的孤形綫西南至熱河的開魯，共軍以「東蒙」爲憑藉，亦時常出擾，國軍隨時能遭受蒙古騎兵的突擊，但其威脅並不大。</p>
<p>遼東半島南端的旅大，目前是很重要的一環。共軍集結在大連的部隊，約計五萬人以上，據悉是很精銳的隊伍。共軍之必欲以武力阻撓國軍接收大連，已無疑問。大連何以如此重要，這可以拿王耀武將軍的話來證明：「接收了大速，山東戰事可以提早六個月結束。」據說，中共視大連爲全「解放區」的門戶。由最近的情勢看，大連勢必接收，這遼東半島最後的一幕接收完成後，對於戰爭的視綫，便被吸引到松北。</p>
<p>九個軍區數字分析</p>
<p>東北共軍的實力幾何？根據最近正確的情報與數字判斷：東北共軍有九個軍區，十個師，七個獨立旅，一個縱隊，一個附屬軍，及一個韓共支隊。九個軍區的兵力約七萬人，計吉東軍區二萬人，吉北四千人，吉南二千人。遼吉軍區一萬一人。遼寗軍區一萬人。綏寗軍區六千人。吉黑軍區六千人。僞滿軍區八千人。松江軍區二千人。其中以吉東軍區兵力爲最大。松北共軍四次南犯之中，這個軍區的部隊即曾參加三次之多，陷其塔木，九台，攻德惠，都有這個這個軍區的部隊。只有在第四次攻勢之中，農安外圍的運動戰，這個軍區却按兵不動。傳說周保中與林彪之間，發生磨擦，原因即在此。十個師的兵力約六萬人：計第一師約四千五百人，駐哈爾濱。第二師約五千人，駐地不詳。第三師約四千五百人，駐岔路口一帶。第四師約四千人駐大賣，第五師四千人，駐陶賴昭附近。第六師五千人，駐五棵樹一帶。第七師兵力最龐大，轄三個旅，約二萬人。駐防五常舒蘭，白旗屯一帶。第八師約三千人，駐大荒溝。第九師約四千人，駐地不詳。獨二師約五千五百人，駐濛江地區。七個獨立旅的兵力，約三萬人，計廿四旅三千人，廿五旅三千人，駐樺甸以東地區。鐵道警二旅，約三千人，駐哈爾濱至雙城鐵路沿綫。獨立旅約七千五百人，駐吉林東部。三十八旅約五千人，四十七旅三千人，駐地均不辭。三百五十九旅約五千人，駐扶餘，是共軍最精銳的基幹。據說旅長由曹里懷兼任。由萬毅指揮的第七縱隊，乓力約三萬人，負野戰任務，流動性很大，目前可能駐長嶺一帶。附屬的民主同盟第一軍及韓共支隊，兵力約一萬五千人，駐地不詳。上列所列的部隊，綜計兵力約廿萬人。再加上大連的五萬人，及其他武工隊等，約計爲卅萬人，這是東北共軍的總兵力。（編者按：另據本報瀋陽廿日電：某軍事負責人表示，此次東北共軍攻勢，係全面的發動，兵力約五十萬，可見共軍又有新的調遣矣。）</p>
<p>東北共軍可以說是孤立的，與國內共軍不能取得密切聯絡，他們企圖打通內蒙走廊，以與晋北共軍取得聯繫，並且拚命地扼守大連，作爲通山東的灘頭陣地，可是這種企圖決不能實現。大連固不堪一擊，內蒙實亦不足恃。</p>

<h3>豫北難民流亡圖</h3>
<p>— 鄭州廿日航訊　本報駐鄭記者范世勤</p>
<p>據說：安陽城內外的四十萬難民，都是因爲怕共產黨的「鬥爭」逃出來的。我們且不管他們是否個個有被「鬥爭」的資格，可是他們眼前在共軍密密砲火圍攻之下，在事實上是被「鬥爭」了。</p>
<p>從安陽城裏逃出</p>
<p>一批一批的民衆代表，一到鄭州，號淘大哭，籲請軍事當局趕快援兵，請求各方趕運糧食，激起鄭州一般人士驚愕不置。這情形，正像一個人從其被一些强盜包圍的屋子的屋頂上跳出來，逃到大街裏，大喊救命，害得街上行人驚駭起來一樣。</p>
<p>眼前救濟安陽難民</p>
<p>只有一個辦法：派飛機去送糧。省府同一個航空公司接洽，公司提出條件：一架飛機來回送糧一次，價三千四百萬元；如果飛機遇難失事，賠美金外匯三萬元，現鈔美金五萬元。省府對這些條件，都一一答應下來。實在的，不是這樣一面素重價以救命，一面出重價以救命的話，那顯得侖的價値的重要呢！</p>
<p>事情雖然談妥，可是在安陽被圍十餘日後的十七日還沒有一架飛機派出去送糧。</p>
<p>新鄕一帶廿萬難民</p>
<p>據省府社會處處長李鴻音談，其中非救不活的至少有八萬餘人。豫北難民救濟委員會十日在新鄉成立，每天至少有二千難民來登記。豫北二十五個縣，目前都在辦難民登記。豫北局勢要是僵持下去，那末豫北的人民必定要成耶路撒冷的聖徒一樣出走了。</p>
<p>從新鄕拿了一萬五千元的救濟費的難民而到鄭州的，有二萬五千多人。住在鄭州有豫北親戚朋友的人家，近來頗感覺難以應付的痛苦。這些難親難友上門來，不招待吧，人情上說不過去；招待吧，物價這樣高，可吃不消。這二萬五千多難民，到粥廠去求食的，只有二千多人，其餘都是寄食在親友地方。這與研究中國社會問題的人，倒是個很好資料，來證明中國社會關係建築在那裏。那種悲慘的歡叙的情形，如果能够　到舞台上，也是一齣很好的滑稽的悲劇。</p>
<p>五千多個青年學生</p>
<p>在新鄕等地塡了願意到後方來上學的志願書，也南渡到了鄭州。初高中畢業班的學生，是上了學了；其他非畢業學生，有的回家，有的在鄭州參加了幾次球賽以後，興緻索然地又回到豫北起了。據說：有二分之一的學生，是倒流了。敎育部現在已經派人到鄭州來救濟這些靑年，可是那些被派來的人首先要被「救濟」，因爲他們到了幾天以後，還沒有找到房子，無法辦公。</p>
<p>鄭州的物價擠漲了</p>
<p>我問一個難民；『躱在家裏，不逃出來可行嗎？』那個難民回答：『我原不想逃，可是那天八路軍一個運長先到了我的家鄕，（湯陰鄕下）硬要我走。我說：「我今天出去，明天就得餓死，呌我到那裏去呢？」那個連長說：「就是你明天眞的要餓死，今天也得出去！」這是他一個人的好意，呌我們一鄕的人都走。』</p>
<p>現在鄭州成了</p>
<p>難民交織而來之地</p>
<p>大概東面來的是回黃泛區的難民，北面來的是從豫北被共軍逼迫出來的難民。每天各有一二千名，他們目前的境遇是兩樣的，可是他們能够互相體味到的痛苦是一樣的。現在買泛區裏也還有些共軍在竄擾，這些回黃泥區的難民，在心頭上添上的暗陰，惟有豫北的難民的淚眼看得出的；豫北難民開始的流浪的辛酸，也惟有這流徙異地十載的黃泛區的難民的心中體念得到的。</p>
<p>省府已經決定辦法</p>
<p>讓豫中襄，郊，酈，禹，葉，舞六縣來安頓豫北難民，鄭州預備收容一萬餘人。現在最成問題的是糧食，鄭州緊急救濟難民委員會想請求聯總撥些麵粉。現在聯總已有二千二百噸的麵粉放在鄭州，是預備救濟黃泛區的。可是目前黃泛區也在不安定之中，那大批的麵粉是沒有方法運過去發放，如果讓它靡爛在鄭，不如發給豫北難民吃。現在就是看聯總是否準備救活這些不幸的人羣了。</p>

<h3>現代法蘭西繪畫論　情緒的感受與與實</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>假使我們觀察萬物所具之形態，並不是以視覺底形式爲問題，所感受的是由於知覺底「綫」和「色」和「面」所維繫的形態。我們縱然感受到萬物所具有的物質底現象，但欲表現知覺底物的眞實性，在色彩的塲合亦同樣。所以，如果極端的傾向於知覺底眞實性，便具有一個符號或一種象徴那樣的力量。舉一實例以明之，達達主義的繪畫工作便是如此。</p>
<p>達達主義的工作，不消說是繪畫上的無政府主義，但這並不是由於無知所生的懷疑，亦非由於無知而出之否定，而是知覺的極端的伸展。</p>
<p>這樣的傾向，在立體主義畫法中表現得很濃厚。所謂立體畫法的繪畫，業已充分超越了所謂視覺的感覺，旣無視覺底僞視法，亦無須視覺底透視法的必要。可以說祗想把物質的面，藉知覺應用於一個畫面之上，立體畫法所感受的，已非是繪畫底視覺，更無感情可言，祗能說它是繪畫底Connaisauce的尊重，以及知覺底感受性的極端的驅使。</p>
<p>達達主義如是，立體主義亦復如是；從這樣傾向的繪畫長成的所有巴黎畫派的畫家們，大多都是强調着知覺底感受性的。例如超現實主義縱無達達主義所具有的懷疑性和否定性，但說他們把顯著的知覺底感受性極度驅使至於像一種符號或象徵，當無語病。超現實主義畫家視物的時候，對於Imagination（想像力）特別顯得重視，甚至嘗思使之發生變態。所以，所謂重視想象力者，似乎有與知覺底感受性背道而馳之嫌，其實並不矛盾。所謂使用想像力而使物的知覺發生變態者，無非是在推行知覺底眞實。因此，我們可以說；屬於繪畫的現實主義的精神，和超現實主義的精神，都是屬於繪畫的知覺的寫實性。</p>
<p>這種現象，從現代巴黎畫派中以立體畫法爲基礎而作畫的所有畫家，均可看到。例如葛洛梅爾（Marcel　Grommaire）是如此，祁利柯（Giorgio　de　Chirico）亦是如此，還有傅可尼（Eouconier）賴石FermardLeger）輩，亦莫不皆然。</p>
<p>我們可以針對着上述兩種繪畫底感受性，來考察第三種繪畫底態度。因爲畫家重視情緒的感受性，而想把由情緒所感受到的眞實性「繪畫底」的表現出來，所以，我們可稱之爲情緒的寫實性（Realite　de　Sentiment）。</p>
<p>這裏不妨說：自我們人類文化開創以來，沒有再比現代這樣的尊重人類情感的時代。所調原始人類，都是以這種情感為中心而作畫的。他們旣能把神感受爲一隻羔羊；也會用愛物的心情當作一位女神來感受。而且他們對於這種以情感爲中心的感受性，並不感到什麼新奇，同時也不須要此外任何一切。然而隨着人類文化的演進，想僅恃情緒以判斷或思考事物殆非可能。爲了那末悠長的傳統，幾已將這種重視畫上的情感一點，完全遺忘。可是到了現代，藝術家對於這種情感，又極度的重視起來了。</p>
<p>那是因爲現代的藝術家，已經悠到藝術的世界便是感性的世界之故；如果棄除這種感受性，是不能感受到所謂藝術之美的。是以畫家不信任一切視覺，亦不以探求知覺爲必要，唯專恃他天賦獨特的情感，作爲唯一的藝術底指南針。畫家的觀察自然和萬物，決非僅是機械底視覺的反映。至少可以說是反映於畫家的心坎的及爲畫家的情感所感受的自然或萬物。所以，縱令不能够逼眞自然或萬物，亦決不成爲繪畫底問題。所成爲問題的，倒是那個畫家的情感是不是屬於繪畫底？所謂屬於「繪畫底」者，就是說繪畫底被純粹化，被裁製。畫家的情感，實是天賦他們的一種素質，精神和心境。</p>
<p>假若畫家能表現其情感所感受到的眞實，那就是他最獨有的表現，也是最個性的表現。一切物象可爲畫家所觀察，所感受，但所謂畫家的情感，却是每一個畫家獨自所惑到的意境。由於情感所感受的眞實，眞正是個人底，獨自底。在想表現眞正個人底獨自底塲合，所謂情感的寫賞工作就値得研究了。</p>
<p>馬克，薛納爾，就想使從自然所感受到的一切變爲由情感所感受的，而就那末表現於畫面。倘使他感到一尾魚的美味，並性喜杯中物的話，他的思想一定會立刻飛翔於空問。這種情形，也許不能以視覺底觀察，或者知覺底着想，然而在情感上却可以明白而自由地感受。他想自由地眞實地依然不改原形的表現他的情感。因此，人們看他這種情形的時候，或許感覺得有點想象底和空想底，然而薛納爾却不喜歡人們說他的繪畫是奇想天外Fantustic。因爲他決不認爲是想象，相反地他認爲是眞實，且相信自己是一個寫實派畫家之故。</p>
<p>所謂關於繪畫上的情感的眞實，實含有畫家出自心坎的讚歌之意。畫家在歌頌其情感一點上，感到生命的喜悅。喬琪，盧奧（Gearge　Reault）把這種情感作爲宗敎的莊嚴的東西阿梅德，莫狄格里阿尼（Amedeo　Modigliani）則是在感能底愉快之中感覺此稱情感。由此種種證明，現代法蘭西的繪畫，旣非視覺，又非知覺，而祇是一種以情感爲中心的繪書底趨向。</p>
<h3>金松岑與「孽海花」</h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>『讀孽海花』的作者燕谷老人，琴川宿儒，姓張名鴻字隱南，近有人爲之記云：「有疑燕谷老人爲逝世不久之吳江老名士金松岑之化名者，則以『孽海花」正集之起首三回，本出金之手筆，其後方由東亞病夫續成。……」不錯，燕谷老人並不是金松岑，但金松岑對於『孽海花』初稿，所作實也不僅是起首三回。</p>
<p>不過今之「孽海花」小說，多是民國十六年的修改本，較之在那二十年以前的二十四同本，已大不相同，因而其中還存有金作幾許，就連東亞病夫曾孟樸自己，已經弄不淸楚了。不但此也，金旣是此書的造意人，則在當時擬定寫作的計劃，已有六十回全目，必定還有他的許多意見參預其中的。再看東亞病夫後於修改本的序內說：</p>
<p>「這書造意的動機，並不是我，是愛自由者。他非別人，就是吾友金君松岑，名天翮。他發起這書，曾做過四五回，我那時正創辦小說林書社，提倡譯著小說，他把稿子寄給我看，我看了，認是一個好題材。但是金君的原稿，過於注重主人公，不過描寫一個奇突的妓女，略映帶些相關的時事……在我的意思却不然，想借用主人公做全書的綫索，盡量容納近三十年來的歷史。……當時就把我的意見，告訴了金君。誰知金君竟順永推舟，把繼續這書的責任，全卸到我身上來。我也就老實不客氣的，把金君四五回的原稿，一面點竄塗改，一面進行不息，三個月工夫，一氣呵成了二十回。這二十回裏的前四回，雜揉着金君的原稿不少。即如第</p>
<p>一回的引首詞和一篇駢文，都是照着原稿，</p>
<p>一字未改。其餘部分，也是觸處都有，連我</p>
<p>自己也弄不淸楚誰是誰的。就是現在已修改</p>
<p>本裏，也還存着一半金君原稿的成分。」</p>
<p>有這一段話，可我以爲在「孽海花」書上，即使印上「愛自由者，東亞病夫合著」的字樣，似亦無不可。</p>
<p>再說這位吳江老名士金松岑，他在去今四十年以前，所以能爲這一部頗有革命思想的『孽海花』小說的造意人，亦不爲無因。我們要知道，在當時爲鼓吹革命最有力的鄒容烈士著的那本「革命軍」，爲之　資印刷者，也是有他一份的。他又名金一，茲據『晚淸小說史」內說：曾見其文集二種，又編譯『自由血」一種，係俄國虛無黨史。「三十三年落花夢」，亦係彼在晚淸所譯。」所以又如在『革命逸史』裏所述的金天翩，那時也常爲革命活動，且繼上海愛國女學之後而亦回鄕去辦那樣的女學。</p>
<p>又在『晚淸小說史」裏說，金松岑在那時亦爲文藝理論家，在「新小說」雜誌上曾導過一篇很重要的小說論，就是題爲『論寫情小說與新社會之關係」，由是闡明小說對於改革社會的價値。也曾提到他的那種傑作『女界鍾」，但未詳著者姓名，而在『中國婦女生活史』內却說是「愛自由者金一」著，遂把這個「謎」又褐穿了。這是一種鼓吹婦女從事革命的小册子，而其對於男女平櫂的主張，即在四十五年以後的今天看起來，也還是很値得我們的敬佩，若論其熱情則儘可說是「革命軍」的「姊妹篇」。</p>
<h3>治印</h3>
<p>— 錢君匋</p>
<h3>藝術放談——觀錢君徐菊庵書畫展後</h3>
<p>— 徐偉</p>
<p>藝術是一種官能的敎育。然而造形藝術的創作，却是可以不分國界，不分人種它可以超越任何的人爲和自然的限制，在地域和程度上，具有廣泛和深刻的流佈性。一幅中國木刻家的木刻，可以不加說明，在蘇聯展覽，而收獲到敎育和共鳴的效果。初民時代西班牙阿爾泰密拉洞壁上的圖畫，在現代人看來，也可以看出它的作用和意慾。這種文字語言的力量所不能到達的地方，造形藝術却可以很自然而且容易地到達。所以一個國家的文化水準愈高，它的造形藝術必愈發達。就以中國來說，中國已有五千年的歷史，這種歷史的智慧的累積，我們可以從中國的造形藝術上看得出來。這也就是說，我們只要一看到那種筆觸細緻，佈局深遠的中國畫，以及神韻蒼勁，變幻靈巧的中國字，我們便可以很明確地推斷出它的偉統的智慧。</p>
<p>這一次，在寗波同鄉會看了徐菊庵錢君甸二先生的「書畫篆刻展」以後，我便有了這樣的感覺。</p>
<p>和錢君甸先生認識，已經有了好幾年，然而我僅知道他是一個書面裝幀家，一個傾倒於表現主義的愛好的圖案畫者。及至幾天前到了錢先生的書店裏去談天，偶然間覺察到他忙於展覧會的準備工作，這才看到了大宗的錢先生的墨翰和金石的篆刻成績。今天，和錢先生的一次談話以後，我才知道他的書法的研究已近二十年，而金石的篆刻，在五六年前也已積極地加工。這次展覽的作品，總計字和篆刻有一百數十件。在書法方面，帶有金冬心的隸書和趙撝叔的魏書的氣息，看來洋洋乎不勝蒼勁豪爽的一覺。在篆刻方面，他初期學習吳昌碩的作風，此後則漸趨於趙撝叔的傾向。但亦僅僅只是「傾向」而已，通過學習時期不可避免的模擬階段，他却曾經而且不斷地正在努力於自我的創造。尤其是金石篆刻的自成一體，非常顯然。而石刻的「邊白」，也　用近代體的淺顯文字，例如「帮閒」一件，其「邊白」有云：「昔蔣山堂譏羅兩峯時與大人先生交往，實乃帮閒耳。今余雖未與大人先生交往，然酬應有閒階級之求書求畫，其帮閒則一，不免爲山堂之流竊笑，因刻。」於此，我們正可以淸晰地窺見一個藝術家的苦衷了，而錢先生的對於藝術的看法，也已經彰然道破於字裏行間。</p>
<p>和錢先生同鄕而又共同致力於造形藝術的國畫家徐菊庵先生，這次展覽的作品共有一百六十餘件。徐先生的從事國畫，完全出於自習。他自幼便歡喜圖畫，民國十六年後，到了上海，始與上海的若干國畫家往來，所以徐先生的從事國畫的經歷，差不多已有四十年的歷史。而徐先生在國實中僅致力於工筆的仕女人物畫，偶以山水作背景，但並不致力於純粹的山水畫，這種專一的方向，更使徐先生獲致超然的成就。在展覽的作品之中，「四紅圖」是一幅最爲優秀的作品，作者自己也是這樣的感覺。此外如「八仙圖」，作者在同一畫幅上，充分表達了八個人不同的個性，可見作者的繪畫的研究，不僅僅是表面的，而是心理的；不僅是色彩的配置，而還有意韻的表達。</p>
<p>綜觀徐先生的繪畫，使我們有輕雅秀麗的感觸；再看錢先生的書法和篆刻，使我們有蒼勁豪邁的感應；前者具有柔性的美，後者蘊蓄剛性的力，比觀並閱，各有千秋，而且似乎又恰到好處，這自然是此次展覽的可賀「收穫」。</p>
<p>但我在這裏，却應當有理由向兩位作者提出要求，就是：我希望徐先生的國畫，以後應多多採集能够發揮民族意識的歷史題材，使國畫不僅僅在平易的表現上盡職，而要洋溢着濃烈的戰鬥性，發揚更積極的時代義意。至於錢先生的字刻呢，我希望能够儘豈脫却古老的因襲的窠日，尤其是書法的取村，必要時用自創的造句或白話的體裁來表達作者的情和意，因爲嶄新的形式便可以裝嵌嶄新的內容。</p>
<p>藝術的生命是需要不斷地灌輸新的血液的！</p>

<h3>碧湘閣詞</h3>
<p>— 陳家慶</p>
<p>李洞庭君索題未晚樓面雲水故鄉好，千里洞庭湖；一片滄波浩蕩，有客探　珠。家住岳陽樓下，落日紅吞光射；拍案忽驚呼，攬　魯陽在，晞髮幾曾孤！　韶光　，人未老，景堪娛；君山如畫，笑看風物尙當初；留得桑園萬頃，待接淸芬世盛，如展輞川圖。我亦半天下，江海憶莼號。</p>
<p>鷓鴣天　元夕寄玉姊集白石道人句</p>
<p>春點疏梅雨後枝，剪燈心事峭寒時；而今正是歡游夕，惆悵歸來有月　。　花滿市，夜何其？人間久別不成悲，闌干表立蒼龍背，淝水東流無盡期！</p>
<h3>歌</h3>
<p>— 胡訥</p>
<p>歌，雄壯的，嘹亮的，燃起了我靑春的火花，使我不悲傷，不氣餒，增加了我苦幹和奮鬥的決心。</p>
<p>所以，我愛歌，因爲，雄壯敎昂的歌聲穿過了我的內心，沸騰着我的熱血；奮發嘹亮的歌聲穿過了我的內心，敎發起我的信心；我會在歌聲裘，抹去過去的創痛，遺棄頹廢的思念，生活在活躍的天地裏，爲工作而工作！</p>
<p>我記得：「馬賽進行曲」曾經拯救過失望的法闌西士兵；「義勇軍進行曲」永遠使東北的義勇軍堅持了十幾年抗日的信心。</p>
<p>多麼偉大的歌聲啊！它是我們生活的興奮劑；像雨露一樣，滋潤了人們的心田！</p>
<p>歌是生命的動力，是人們生活的光彩！</p>
<p>我愛歌，在歌聲里我要奮起，不絕地工作，留下一些可寳貴的跡痕。</p>
<p>我更需要歌聲來滋潤我的生命，充實我的生活；悲傷，頹廢，灰心……遠離着我，讓雄壯的，嘹亮的歌伴着我。因為我還年靑，我要工作。</p>
<h3>作曲家李滋</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>名作曲家李滋（Frank　Lizt）的性格原來是很溫和的，但有時也作出極不近人情的事。一天，一個少年作曲者把他認爲得意之作送給李滋指正，李滋便指出一節最糟的對他說：「這在音樂裏是不可能的。」</p>
<p>「可是，」這少年傲然說，「我却辦到了。」</p>
<p>李滋冷笑一聲，把鋼　醮了墨水就任意的向他的外衣上揮灑。「這也是辦得到的，」他說，「但這能成嗎？」</p>
<p>他說完便不響的跑出去給這個啼笑皆非的少年買一件新的外衣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血517</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「不知道。我剛到萬歲館灣了一灣，看了看您同中村小姐的房間，倒是沒有什麼，……無意聽到接値　的下女們，透出這個自殺的消息，可也沒有人說明那個下女自殺的原因……」。</p>
<p>「我倒知道」！守一聽正岩說到這裏，便插口了。</p>
<p>「您也聽到這事」？鶴見因想到守一，並沒到萬歲館云過，自己也沒對守一提起過這位韓人女子的事，覺得守一的話，有些突兀，所以這麼問着守一。</p>
<p>「我剛同那位韓人青年又見過面了；—就是下午上旅舍云過的那位青年—他告訴我，他又少了一個幫手了。問起什麼原因，他說起他的手下，在萬歲館方面，一工有兩人，拿下女職務作掩護，注意日人行動，其中一個，忽然自殺了；想必就是正岩說的這一位」。</p>
<p>「她自動自殺的—遺書上說她『因爲失職，自己處罰』！……我猜想就是爲了萍子小姐失踪的事」。……</p>
<p>「萍子失踪，怎麼算妙失職呢」？鶴見覺得這「失踪」與那韓女的自殺，沒有有聯緊。</p>
<p>「想必她認為她應當保護萍子小姐，在萍子小姐出外的時候，她沒有向總部報吿，所以總部沒有派人尾隨保護……」。</p>
<p>「我明白了」，鶴見似有所悟；「早晨那封信，想必是她的路綫，呌人投來的—就是韓人志士們約請萍子到外灘公園會而的那封信—她旣是接近萍子的人，照理，萍子的一舉一動，都應該隨時注意。沒有向總部報吿，也沒有隨手想辦法派人追隨保護，固然也算她失了職，可也不應當自殺哪」！</p>
<p>「他們的團規很嚴緊，我想。……韓人的脾氣，異常壯烈，尤其在日本小鬼屈壓之下。她是個女子，天然心眼窄狹，所以……」。</p>
<p>守一的議論尙未完畢，車子已經曳然停住。他們已到外灘公園約會的地點了。</p>
<p>「還是讓我去探探，那邊牆脚樹影下，好像有兩個人……」守一對鶴見和正岩說着，人已下了車，向公園矮牆走公，不到半分鐘，又折回頭來，冲着汽車招了招手，喊着正岩。正岩下車，迎着守一走去，二人一對面，就像工蟻專遞消息一般，只一接觸，雙方觸鬚一對，各自背道走開；正岩向牆脚人影走去，守一上車，替代正岩駕駛；鶴見這時却從後廂，跨過座背，翻到前廂，坐在守一身邊。車子飛也似的，向虹鎭方面駛去。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>某哲人謂：</p>
<p>「別離」給予我們死亡意味的預示；「會晤」則給予我們復活意味的預示示他鄕遇故知，誠然是人間一大樂事。即使是沒有什麼關係的人如果別離了數十年，突然一旦相晤，那種快樂也是不可言喩的。此無他，這完全是心理上感到復活意味的緣故。</p>
<p>有一個富翁破產了，見人輒大談其當年的富綽生活。他無時無刻不在記憶他的過去。</p>
<p>有一個窮人當了，他忘記了當年牛衣對泣的窘况，納上了三妻四妾。</p>
<p>這兩種情况，很平常地存在於我們的社會中。我覺得很奇怪，是不是「富貴」會阻礙人們的回憶呢？</p>
<p>我想起了一個故事：</p>
<p>一個富人去拜訪一位哲學家。</p>
<p>哲學家的家裏擺設得很簡單。靠　放着一面大鏡子，對着鏡子，便是玻璃窗，窗外可以看見來來往往的行人。</p>
<p>哲學家指着玻璃窗，間當翁道：「從這玻璃裏面可以看見什麼？」</p>
<p>「人羣。」富翁答運。</p>
<p>哲學家又指着鏡子說：「從這玻璃裏面可以看見什麼？」富翁望了望鏡子，自顧胖胖的腦袋。很簡單地回答道：「我！」</p>
<p>哲學家嘆了一口氣，感傷地說：</p>
<p>「同樣是一塊玻璃，只是這一塊多了一點銀子，你就只能看見有自己，而不知有人羣。」</p>

<h3>狗也瘋的多了</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>上海市衛生局昨日發表統計，據稱去年一年赴衛生局求醫的瘋犬病患者，有三千二百八十七人，不治斃命者有三十八人。今年一月至四月，赴局注射者有九百七十六人，死亡者已有十人。可知目前瘋犬的威脅，極爲嚴重。現在衛生局已經建議三項防止辦法，日內即將通過施行。我們希望這些辦法能够即日通過，即日施行，而且施行得澈底和有效</p>
<p>按瘋犬病一名恐水病，患者到了相當時期，見水恐懼，連聽見了水聲都害怕，故有此名，這是一種傳染性的疾病，由瘋犬傳染到人類身上，然而患此病者。並不限於狗類，其他動物如狐，狼，鼬鼠，以至於某種的羊，鳥等等，都能同樣染到。總而言之，凡是熱血動物，都有傳染的可能。一旦瘋了，它們祇要稍遇刺激，就會向對方突襲，多數是牙齒，然而也有用蹄，用角，以至用喙的，不過我們所見者多數是瘋犬，所以就將此病棰爲瘋犬病</p>
<p>一條狗瘋了以後，其症狀是逐漸演進的。它開始暴露不安的狀態，喜歡孤獨，搜集草類，繩索以及木片。用舌舐寒冷的東西，如鐵與石頭之類。性欲絕頂强烈，此後吞食皮毛，木頭以至於石頭和泥土，聲音嘶啞起來。最後四肢疲軟，行步蹣跚，頭尾下垂，張口吐舌。然後慢慢躱藏到冷僻的地方，自行死去。</p>
<p>瘋狗之令人害怕，因爲它要咬人，被咬的人也會發瘋，以至於因瘋而死。</p>
<p>然而更可怕的是，瘋狗雖瘋，並不咬它的主人。此惟感難加約束，稍一不愼。它就逃了出去，於是碰到什麼活的東西，它就要張口而噬。如果瘋狗要咬主人，受害的祇有一人，且可立即將它擊斃，基至在未咬以前，將它處死。現在它竟然還保存着這點「靈性」，就使它成爲眞正危險的東西。</p>
<p>瘋狗還有兩個特徴；第一，它咬人的時候，默不作聲，右時輕輕一咬，有時咬得牙齒咬斷，牙牀扭曲，可見其狠。第二，它如果不幸挨打，也確能「咬緊牙關」，默不作聲，不像一般的狗兒那樣要厲聲呌號；瘋狗即使被打得流血車傷，它也能默然忍受下去。這又是狠的表現。</p>
<p>瘋狗的災難，從去年起就有人大聲疾呼，要求防止的了，此禍於今爲烈，誠屬不幸。防止瘋犬，現在用的是檢騐和注射。可是還有一個更簡單的更原始的方法，我們希望當局採用：就是在有瘋犬病發現的期內，所有的狗都須戴上口罩。英國自一九〇二年以來，四十多年沒有瘋犬出現了。他們最有效的方法，就是讓狗戴口罩。在最後一條瘋犬發現的六個月之中，還不許除掉口罩。而且當時實施的範圍極廣，包括三島全部。這方法我們應該採用，解除瘋狗的武裝。</p>
<h3>奇怪的婚俗</h3>
<p>— 中立</p>
<p>蒙古人結婚，丈夫總要比妻子小五六歲，所以男子是很早就結婚的，他們結婚的時候，須先拜綿羊，後拜天地，喇嘛佛像，和父母親友。他們的初夜良宵，是不進新房，而是住在另外一個蒙古包，或草棚中度過。</p>
<p>馬來半島上有一部份土人，他們的婚姻，是交換式的，好比朋友交換妻子，以及將自己的姐妹，送與朋友爲妻等。</p>
<p>我國甘肅地方常有弟兄數人合娶一個妻子的，如果連合娶的力量也沒有，則可以向有妻子的人去租一個時期。</p>
<p>西伯利亞人，丈夫如果戴一頂破帽遮住了臉，這樣妻子就知道丈夫不要他，而進行離婚了。</p>
<h3>人人是個蠢才</h3>
<p>— 卓超譯</p>
<p>哈伯說過：「每人每天至少有五分鐘是個蠢才，聰明人也無法例外。」</p>
<p>因此，我經常備着一個記錄本，題爲「我所做的認事」。我時時翻看它，籍此帮助我解決最一大的處世問題。</p>
<p>前任財務部長H．P．豪威爾，起初只是個鄉村商店中的小書記，後來成爲卡納其鋼鐵公司的信用經理，有一次，他吿訴我他的一個成功之道：「不知有多少年」他說：「我經常帶着一本事務記錄册，册中記載着我的一切工作。每當星期六的晚上，我便翻閱着這本册子，同時對我的自星期一早晨以來所做的一切，加以嚴密的反省。我自問着：「做錯了什麼沒有？」應當怎標矯正做錯的事？」我如此的分析我自已，有時候覺得這種習慣很枯燥，不過除了這，我實在不曾嘗試過別的更有效的成功之道。」</p>
<p>顯然，豪威爾的這個成功之道是從富蘭克林那裏偸來的。每天晚上，富蘭克林例有一次嚴密的自省，結果發現了他自己有十三個大缺點，其中有三個是：浪費時間，致力瑣事，和人空辯。</p>
<p>每天，富蘭克林必向一個缺點宣戰，一直維持到滿一星期爲止，第二個星期，他又向另一個缺點宣戰。如此的繼續着二年，結果，他寫道：「世界上有三種最堅硬的東西：鋼，鑽石，認識自己。」</p>
<p>似如有人指斥你是個「該死的蠢才」，那你怎麼辦？這裏是林肯的辦法：有一次，林肯發下了個調動某軍隊的命令，當時陸軍統帥斯丹敦認爲這個命令錯誤之極，堅決不肯接受，並指斥林肯是個「該死的蠢才」。當林首間接得知斯丹敦的話時，他就說：「斯丹敎說得對，我應當自己反省反省。」不久，林肯居然收回了那個命令。</p>
<p>我們常人大都厭恨抨擊自己的人，其實這是不應該的，我們應當反過來去歡迎他，因爲事實上，我們在四次工作中，萬難有三次以上的工作做得很對。老羅斯福在白宮中特別喜歡和愛因期坦親近，因爲愛因斯坦能時常指斥他的工作有百分之九十九是「錯誤之至」。</p>
<p>羅雪夫考特說過：「敵人的對我們抨擊比我們的自評要正確得多。」</p>
<p>總之，人人是個蠢才，只有豪威爾，富闌克林，才能造出一個偉人。請問你是否和他們同一類的人物呢？</p>

<h3>先輩趣事</h3>
<p>— 雲間</p>
<p>朱似石先生諱運新，前淸進士，松郡西鄉人也。與余家爲世交。生前嘗吿余曰，令先曾祖軼才公，文才豪宕，沈思明辯。凡文章經義，一經指示，豁然貫通，余時往請益。一日淸晨，直達寢室，軼公猶未起，余執經問難，乃披衣起，並爲余反覆詳解，正滔滔不絕間，忽訝失一襪，余亦爲檢視，遍索不得，卒由令先曾祖母於箱筒中檢一襪與之。明晨謂余曰，昨晚就寢，以脫襪不得出，，累得一身大汗。問其詳，知昨晨方凝神講解，乃將兩襪同穿一足，於是一足乃無襪。。昔年襪以土布製，且雙層，益厚，長及膝蓋，晚寢遂不得脫焉。</p>
<p>尙有一趣事，似石先生一日來城會客，光往整容，方就剃，接踵而來者二三人，乃坐候，店主旣不識其爲何如人，見其衣服樸素，類似鄕曲，乃用業中暗語，俗所謂切口者，囑夥友日，此鄕曲可草草了事，似老心惡之，無何，剃頭梳辮竟，似老給以制錢一串，計七十文，俗謂一牛，當年成人剃頭制錢二十文，孩童十四人，非婚喪喜慶，無復增益一文者，今夥友以草率從事，忽膺重賞，驚訝不敢受。似老吿之曰，母驚訝，余某人也，受之可耳。店主方知其爲進士公，極道歉忱，旬日後，又往剃髮，店主招待殷勤，親自工作，前次剃頭，不足半小時，茲則費兩小時有餘，其奉承可知矣。而似老與以十四文，店主更驚訝，以爲前者草草則賞七十文，今殷勤若是，僅給十四文，何矛盾至此。似老乃吿之曰，母驚訝，蓋前者之錢，賞今日之勤，今日之錢，乃罰前日之草草耳。店主無以對，啼笑皆非。前輩之風趣有如是。</p>
<h3>「十人三飽」</h3>
<p>— 報童</p>
<p>聯合國機構情報處的主任克里斯丁遜，眞是忍心，他把一個慘之又慘的事情在這次國際糧食生產者大會中宣佈了，他說：這個世界，每十個人中只有三個人吃飽了肚皮。</p>
<p>還有七個人怎麼活下去的呢，克里斯丁遜沒有解釋，大槪是有些才吃飽了一半，有的在挖草根樹皮，有些消耗着自已的脂肪，有的從太陽中去獲取卡路里吧？求生之道，如是而已，所以克里斯丁遜就這樣不說下去了。</p>
<p>在我們，對這樣一個消息是最最理解其意義的，尤其在白米高竄四十萬的時候，我們挺知道餓火是那麼不諒解主人的。雖說亞當和夏姥在伊甸園還有禁果可吃，可是在我們這一個人間，每一枝菓子樹都有它所有權登記的呀。</p>
<p>自然，這樣一想，對那三個能够吃飽肚皮的人實在是羨慕之至了，祗是擔心他們有時是否也會吃得太飽，如果這三位先生用了十人的飯量，那眞是不敢想也不忍想開去的事情了。</p>
<p>蕭伯納如是說：「看到你，就像你是飢荒的原因。」願這是佻皮，不是見證。要我們知道有許多人飢餓，而也有人打着飽噎，這是令人十分不愉快也够殘忍的。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>小茶館老板娘熱心地拉出了一條木板來，讓他們給蘭舖下一些被褥，胡亂就在屋隅躺了下去。蘭自己仍維持着原有的鎭靜，除了呼吸急促之外，一些沒有普通女性倉卒病倒時的那種慌急悲愁的神氣；她並且謝絕了另一位女團員的建議，始終沒有把外衣脫除，那是由於她愛潔成癖的特性。</p>
<p>盧前找了一個機會，把老祝拉到茶館外面去。</p>
<p>「唉！」話不曾出口，他就先嘆氣。「老祝，我瞧胡太太的病很重！方才我量過她的熱度，你不是也瞧見的嗎，已經過四十度了！她的眼白也紅得很，光吃幾顆阿斯匹靈，怕沒有用。你得趕快給她想辦法才好！」</p>
<p>說話時他的兩條眉毛幾乎已連成一起了。</p>
<p>老祝用手亂抓自己的頭皮。</p>
<p>他們方才所搭的那輛車是講明搭到金城江爲止的，老祝原來的計劃是想在到達金城江之後，再換別的車上去，因爲他知道金城江這個地方太小，過去又燒過兩次大火，根本是無法可以找到屋子歇下來的。然而蘭突然病了，並且病得如此之兇，敎他怎麼再有勇氣帶她立刻上路呢？</p>
<p>「方才我聽茶館老板說，昨晚這兒又燒了一塲大火，是子彈車爆炸，所有的屋子全燒光了！唉·這個倒霉的地方！」廬跛子又報告了一個惡消息。</p>
<p>懷着滿腔不快的祝兆年更用力的抓着自己的頭皮；隔了好一會，他才瞅茄盧前搖搖頭，又像發牢騷又像跟他打趣地說：</p>
<p>「不，老盧，應該說倒霉的中國！」</p>
<p>「唉！」老盧沒有話，還是嘆氣。</p>
<p>祝兆年現在已改變了主意，他認爲要在金城江留宿顯然是絕對不可能的事，並且這小鎭上也決不會有適合的醫療設備，所以唯一的辦法，就是趕快找車，仍照原定計劃繼續前進。</p>
<p>他先上公路檢查站去等待了一個鍾頭模樣，和幾個有權力的人套了套交情，過路的車輛倒不少，據他們吿訴他，可是像這麼可以一下搭載三四十個人的空軍却就絕無僅有；除非他把全班人馬分做幾起，那末今天或許還有希望可以走掉半數。然而這一點却正是老祝所最不願考慮的，因爲不但經濟上不許可，而且他們這一羣流浪了六七年的窮藝人，從來不曾有過這樣搶前落後的習慣。</p>
<p>「你可以到鎭上去絨絨看。」有一位憲兵向他建議。</p>

<h3>Deadline for Submissions to the Council and Acceptance of Proposals; Yesterday the Deliberative Council Received Reports on Agriculture, Forestry, Military Affairs, and Transportation; Lin Wei Attended to Explain the Military Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The seventh session of the Deliberative Council was held on the morning of the 24th. The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng, attended to report on the general administrative situation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, making him the first youth party minister to participate in administrative reporting. The councilors expressed great concern. A total of 194 councilors attended, chaired by Jiang Yong. After the Secretariat's routine report, Zuo began his report at 9:30 a.m., ending at 10:15 a.m., lasting forty-five minutes. The content avoided the important and emphasized the trivial, which was quite well received. The Secretariat then read five written inquiries, followed by fifteen oral inquiries. Zuo then answered them one by one. The chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting at 12:00. (Zuo's report can be found on page 2)</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The eighth session of the Deliberative Council was held at 3:15 p.m. on the 24th, chaired by Jiang Yong. 197 councilors attended. First, the chairman reported on the proposals, requesting that they be submitted by 8:00 p.m. on the 24th. Then, Deputy Minister Lin Wei of the Ministry of National Defense gave a military report. Lin divided the report into two parts: demobilization and reorganization of the army, and national defense construction, providing detailed analysis. He also gave a detailed report on the current military situation. After the report, councilors raised 43 written and oral inquiries, mostly focusing on the current military situation, military discipline, and conscription issues. Lin gave brief answers. After a 20-minute break at approximately 6:20 p.m., the meeting resumed. Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei gave a report. Yu first explained the implementation of the resolutions related to transportation from the previous plenary session of the Deliberative Council. Then, he separately explained the current situation of railway, highway, aviation, telecommunications, and postal service reform. This lasted 27 minutes. Then, written inquiries were conducted, totaling 25. After they were read, it was already 7:40 p.m. The chairman immediately announced the adjournment of the meeting and scheduled a continuation of the oral inquiries and Minister Yu's answers for 9:00 a.m. on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to the Deliberative Council's meeting schedule, there will be no break on Sunday morning. The ninth session is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on the 25th. In addition to Yu Dawei answering councilors' inquiries about the Ministry of Transportation, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua will also give an education report. There will be a recess in the afternoon. At 4:00 p.m., the Executive Yuan will host a tea party, and at 7:00 p.m., the general assembly will host a movie.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Deliberative Council stopped accepting proposals at 8:00 p.m. on the 24th. The Secretariat has now received 450 proposals, with economic and financial proposals being the most numerous.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Yang Buping, He Jihong, Zhang Qiyu, Gu Jiegang, Wang Puhan, and more than 70 other councilors submitted an extraordinary motion to the general assembly on the 24th, requesting that Chairman Chiang attend a temporary session to personally hear the councilors' statements. The motion stated: "Each councilor's sincere words are accompanied by tears, but it is a pity that the highest authorities cannot hear them in person, which is of little benefit to national affairs. Therefore, we carefully suggest that the Presidium, in the name of the general assembly, invite Chairman Chiang to attend a temporary general assembly on a scheduled basis, so that each councilor has an opportunity to make a statement, so as to clarify the true situation in various places. We respectfully request a public decision on whether this is appropriate." However, this case was not discussed on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Situation of Communist Army Distribution: 800,000 People Divided into Three Parts; Attempting to Expand Strength Through Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Deputy Minister of National Defense Lin Wei pointed out during his war report to the Deliberative Council on the afternoon of the 24th that there is currently fierce fighting on the outskirts of Changchun. However, the Communist army's attempt to encircle Taiyuan will likely be abandoned due to food shortages. There is currently no fierce fighting in Shandong Province. The Communist army is unable to seize strongholds and can only attack by opportunity. In northern Shaanxi, there has been little military action recently. Lin explained that the Communist army is attempting to expand its strength through guerrilla warfare. In terms of military distribution, the total number of Communist troops is 812,000. 290,000 are in the Northeast, commanded by Lin Biao, with Jiamusi as the main base. In Shandong, the East China Field Army has 190,000 soldiers, commanded by Chen Yi. The Communist army in Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi has 152,000 soldiers, commanded by Liu Bocheng. The Communist army in Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar has 95,800 soldiers, commanded by Nie Rongzhen. The Communist army in northern and northwestern Shanxi has 35,000 soldiers, commanded by He Long. The Communist army in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia has about 50,000 soldiers. These more than 800,000 Communist troops can be roughly divided into three parts: the Northeast Democratic United Army under Lin Biao's command operates independently. The Communist army in Shandong is commanded by Chen Yi. The departments of Nie Rongzhen, Chen Geng, and He Long are commanded by Zhu De. Regarding the current war situation, the Communist army in the Northeast has crossed the Songhua River to invade four times this year, and recently launched a fifth attack, resulting in fierce fighting. In Changchun, 90,000 Communist troops have launched an attack, and fierce fighting is taking place on the outskirts. In Yongji, the Communist army has also dispatched 40,000 troops to invade. In addition, there are 50,000 Communist troops near Meihekou. In the past, the Communist army repeatedly failed to attack strongholds, and now focuses on attacking transportation lines. In the overall war situation in the Northeast, Yongji and Meihekou are used for containment, and the focus is still on the Shenyang line, where there will be fierce fighting. In Shandong, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng have been unable to communicate since the central section of the Jinpu Railway was opened. The remnants of Chen Yi's troops have now moved into the mountainous areas of central Shandong. There is currently no fierce fighting in Shandong Province. The Communist army is unable to seize strongholds and can only attack by opportunity. In Shanxi and Shaanxi, Nie Rongzhen's troops failed to besiege Shijiazhuang. At the beginning of this month, they sent 40,000 troops to invade eastern Shanxi, attempting to join forces with the Communist army in northern and southern Shanxi to spy on Taiyuan. However, they have likely abandoned their attempt to encircle Taiyuan. After the recovery of Yan'an in northern Shaanxi, a part of the Communist army fled to northwestern Shanxi, but there has been little fighting in that area recently.</p>
<p>In his report, Lin also gave detailed explanations on military administration. Regarding the reorganization of the troops, the reorganization and unified compilation plan formulated by the Military Three-Person Group stipulated that within the first 12 months, 242 divisions would be reorganized into 90 divisions, and in the second phase within 6 months, the 90 divisions would be reduced to 50 divisions. In terms of national defense, from March of last year to July of the same year, in 4 months, 57 armies were reorganized into 57 divisions, and 242 divisions were reduced to 154 divisions. The number of personnel was reduced from 3.9 million to 3 million. However, the Communist army did not reduce its size, but instead expanded as much as possible, constantly attacking the National Army. For safety reasons, the government had to temporarily suspend the reorganization work after July of last year. In January of this year, in order to strengthen the troops and conserve military spending, the authorities reorganized again according to the principle of "strengthening the front and tightening the rear." The number of military personnel was gradually reduced to 2.8 million, and the troops were reduced from 154 divisions to 138 divisions. However, this will not affect the troops. In addition, the Air Force maintains 160,000 people, and the Navy maintains 30,000 people. This is because they are limited by national strength, so they could not be expanded.</p>
<p>Regarding the disposal of demobilized officers and soldiers, Lin cited concrete figures in his report. As of April of this year, 47,480 people have been retained, 10,985 are pending, 46,550 have been transferred to other industries, 194,82 are pending, 65,402 have been retired, and 53,122 are pending. Adjustments to the treatment of officers and soldiers have been made three times since July of last year. The treatment of generals has increased from 150,000 to 500,000, the treatment of lieutenant generals has increased from 110,000 to 450,000, the treatment of privates first class has increased from 10,000 to 25,000, the treatment of privates second class has increased from 8,000 to 20,000, and the treatment of privates third class has increased from 6,000 to 15,000. However, this still cannot keep up with prices, and a fourth adjustment will be made starting in May.</p>
<p>In terms of military construction, the most important measure in the past year was the cancellation of the Military Affairs Commission and its reorganization into the Ministry of National Defense. Military education is also highly valued. In the future, efforts will continue to be made in accordance with the established policy to achieve thorough implementation.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Reform the Monetary System</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Deliberative Council by Yin Shuxian and others</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Councilor Yin Shuxian and others submitted a proposal to the general assembly on the 24th regarding the reform of the monetary system. According to Yin, the content of the proposal advocates changing to a gold standard, with a 50% reserve requirement and independent issuance. It also aims to determine the exchange rate with the gold pound and the US dollar. The legal tender will still exist, but it will be changed to subsidiary currency. According to Yin, there are many aspects of this case that need to be studied and discussed, and it cannot be fully disclosed at present.</p>
<h3>Councilors Question Military Affairs; Hoping for an Early End to the War; Proper Placement of Demobilized Officers Should Be Ensured</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] During the military questioning in the afternoon of the 24th, the councilors attached great importance to the current war situation. It was generally believed that the war should end as soon as possible, and some councilors hoped that the authorities would have a clear statement on whether to seek peace or continue the war.</p>
<p>Ma Chengfeng took the floor first, pointing out that two years have passed since the end of the War of Resistance, and a series of mistakes have led to the current situation, which is a tragedy. We have not seen what attitude the government has adopted on the issue of peace or war. It should be made clear whether to pursue peace or continue the war. Otherwise, not only will the public have no clear understanding, but morale will also be affected.</p>
<p>Zhang Deng'ao said: "The people in the Communist-controlled areas hope for peace, but they are afraid of peace talks."</p>
<p>Liu Zhongyi of the Democratic Socialist Party reiterated his appeal, pointing out that the people of the whole country cannot tolerate this situation. We demand peace, but peace is not a one-sided affair. Chen Guangya hoped that the war could end soon and that peace could be achieved, so that we can move from civil war to stability and then to construction. Ju Qianchong of the Youth Party said: Peace is the unanimous demand of the people. He believes that the current military situation should not be attributed to peace talks.</p>
<p>Northern councilor Guan Huai was concerned about the long-term war situation, believing that the authorities should not only focus on Shandong and Shanxi, but also ignore the Northeast. Wang Hansheng hoped that the authorities would not be overly concerned about the international situation, and hoped that they could strengthen the local military force to save the pitiful people of the Northeast from their suffering. Cui Chuiyan, who had just arrived from Changchun, said with tears in his eyes that the "beating-receiving doctrine" adopted by the authorities is unbearable for the people. The main attempt of the Communist army's attack on Changchun is to create a food panic in the Northeast, because the Songhua River basin is the main grain-producing area in the Northeast. In addition, the southern representatives inquired about recent events in Guangdong. He Shifan pointed out that due to the weak strength of the National Army in Guangdong Province, the Communist Party's forces have infiltrated, and this must be prevented.</p>
<p>The issue of military discipline was also a focus of questioning. Some councilors hoped for genuine cooperation between the military and the people. Qian Gonglai was the most vehement in his inquiry, fiercely criticizing the corruption of a certain senior official in the Northeast. Cai Zhisheng reported the reality of the forced occupation of civilian houses and the protection of corruption along the entire Longhai Line. When Qian and others talked about such incidents, their indignation was evident in their words, which moved the listeners.</p>
<p>The councilors expressed sympathy for the demobilized officers, hoping that they could be properly placed so that they would not be let down after having made their greatest efforts during the War of Resistance. More than half of the 25 written inquiries mentioned this issue. During the oral inquiries, Pan Chaoying and others also believed that the crying at a funeral event that recently occurred in the capital was a "wonder," which was truly unfair to the officers and soldiers. In addition, the issues of veterans and the compensation of families of fallen soldiers were also the focus of attention.</p>
<p>The issue of conscription was also raised during the questioning. Cai Zhisheng asked why the conscription quota in Henan was so high, and reported the public sale of recruits. In addition, personnel handling conscription and receiving recruits often deliberately nitpick or delay acceptance, and it is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this. The questioning ended at around 6:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Then, Deputy Minister Lin gave a brief reply, stating that he would accept the inquiries raised by the councilors. Those within the scope of the Ministry of National Defense itself would be studied and implemented as much as possible. Those involving other ministries and departments would also be studied and implemented by the government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Zhang Lan, Zhang Bojun, Han Zhaoquan, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, and other five councilors of the Democratic League recently drafted a peace plan and submitted it to the Deliberative Council on the morning of the 24th.</p>
<h3>Jing Taochen Qiutian Assumes Office; Wang Yunwu Personally Handles the Handover; The New Minister States That He Will Only Use Talent</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Chen Qitian went to the Ministry of Economic Affairs at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th to assume office. Those who took over at the same time as Chen included the newly appointed Political Vice Minister Zhang Zizhu, Acting Permanent Vice Minister Liu Siying, Chief Secretary Zhu Shilong, and Director of General Affairs Wang Lanseng. Former Minister Wang Yunwu personally went to handle the handover and introduced the new minister to the senior officials of the ministry before Chen's speech. Wang said: "I took over as Minister of Economic Affairs on this day last year, and I am handing over on this day this year, exactly one year." He expressed his gratitude to the colleagues of the ministry for their assistance to him over the past year, and said that his predecessor was a scholar, and the new minister is also a scholar. After introducing Chen, Wang asked the colleagues of the ministry to assist the new minister as they had assisted him. Wang also stated that he was most pleased that he had handled the takeover of enemy and puppet materials in over a thousand units during his year in office without any mistakes. This was all due to the diligent work of his colleagues. He went on to point out that the Ministry of Economic Affairs is an industrial administrative department, and that a foundation has been laid for assisting private factories in recent years, and that many industrial regulations have been completed. However, other plans have not yet been started due to environmental and situational limitations, and he hoped that Minister Chen would continue to carry them out and give his full assistance. In his speech, Chen pointed out that the current economic problems have become extremely serious problems that cannot be completely solved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs alone. He feared that he would be unable to live up to the expectations of the people of the country. He then explained three points: First, he is taking over the ministry as a member of the Youth Party, but the ministry is a national institution, and all personnel in the ministry and its affiliated institutions, regardless of their party affiliation, will be treated equally. He hoped that the current personnel would be assured of their positions. Second, in the future, the authorities will do their best to improve industrial and commercial administration and support private enterprises in order to benefit economic construction. He will follow the established rules and trust experts so that they can be improved at any time, establish a scientific foundation for economic construction, and supply the necessary materials for people's lives. Third, the entire economic problem must first be fully discussed by the National Economic Commission and then finally decided by the National Government Committee. Chen began work immediately after his speech.</p>
<h3>Yu Dawei Reports on Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Yu Dawei's report to the Deliberative Council on the 24th can be divided into two parts: one is the implementation of the transportation-related proposals of the previous Deliberative Council, and the other is the current state of transportation. The former includes the following points: (1) In the railway construction section, there is the Tianlan-Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Dushan section of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway. The Shengkang, Min-Gan, Min-Ao, and Gui-Nan lines will soon be under construction. (2) The implementation of military construction of roads is expected to be completed within three years. Class A national roads can accommodate a total of 150,000 surplus officers and soldiers. This plan is currently being discussed with the Ministry of National Defense. (3) Priority will be given to repairing railways in war-torn areas, with the Nanchang-Jiujiang section mostly completed and expected to be fully repaired by the end of next month. (4) Organize postal and telecommunications operations to improve postal and telecommunications efficiency. (5) Development of civil aviation. (6) Compensation for the support of private shipping companies. (7) The issue of wartime requisition of public and commercial military vehicles has been resolved. (8) The free transportation of refugees is still in progress. Last year, the railways transported 150,000 people, charging 25% of the ticket price. Highways transported 120,000 people, acquiring with 50% of ticket price. (9) The Ministry of Transportation can provide equipment and staff at any time. (10) Regarding the reduction of prices for various state-owned transportation enterprises, transportation can be implemented under subsidy measures, but high prices must be considered for national government expenditures.</p>
<p>Regarding the current state of transportation:</p>
<p>(A) Railways are divided into two parts: inside and outside the customs. Those outside the customs are still satisfactory. Those inside the customs are divided into three regions: North China is a repair region, South China is a renovation region, and Southwest and Northwest are construction regions. The North China section is further divided into three straight lines and three horizontal lines. The restoration of each line is extremely difficult. The South China section is divided into three standards: (1) maintaining military communications, (2) restoring pre-war transportation standards, and (3) exceeding pre-war transportation standards. There are six important trunk lines in the Southwest and Northwest: (1) Guangzhou Bay to Liuzhou, (2) Liuzhou to Guiyang, (3) Guiyang to Longchang, (4) Longchang to Chengdu, (5) Chengdu to Tianshui, and (6) Tianshui to Lanzhou. In addition, the Tainan Railway in Taiwan is being taken over.</p>
<p>(B) Highways are divided into three regions: the Southwest is a repair region, the Southeast is a renovation region, and the Northeast is a construction region.</p>
<p>(C) The development of aviation does not depend on the number of aircraft, but on the completeness of ground equipment, such as good warehouses, airports, and repair shops. The ministry cannot help but condemn the plane crash at the end of last year in good conscience. We are currently doing our best to adjust personnel and replenish equipment.</p>
<p>(D) Telecommunications and telegrams, whether military or civilian, have been expedited, and can be delivered to the recipient within about an hour. The postal service has also been improved as much as possible, and airmail is widely used. "Mobile post offices" have also been tested.</p>
<h3>Yu Hung-chun's Financial Report (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Improving the Tax System</p>
<p>Before the war, the national income mainly came from customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax. During the war, direct taxes gradually grew and became the main source of tax revenue. Now, the central tax system consists of four major systems: customs duties, salt tax, direct taxes, and commodity taxes. In recent years, the Ministry of Finance has improved the basic system of each tax according to its nature. The goals are three: (1) simplify the tax system and facilitate merchants and people; (2) cooperate with the economy and maintain production; (3) use tax policies to regulate the distribution of wealth. In the last fiscal year, in order to expand the scope of collection, further improvements were made to the current tax system, which has achieved considerable results in both tax administration and tax revenue. First, in terms of direct taxes, the important goal is to establish a sound and reasonable tax system that takes into account the principles of fairness in taxation and increased tax revenue. Recent measures include: (1) Implementing a categorized and comprehensive income tax system, based on categorized income, and then levying a comprehensive income tax on the total income of each individual that exceeds a certain amount. (2) Implementing a special excess profits tax, which taxes the excess profits of finance, trust, manufacturing, construction, agency, and trading industries. The tax rate ranges from 10% to 60%. (3) Imposing a securities transaction tax on securities transactions made within the exchange, which is withheld and remitted to the national treasury by the original brokers. (4) Due to the revision of the financial revenue and expenditure system law, the business tax was assigned to local authorities. A special business tax is being planned for national businesses, targeting banks, insurance, trusts, exchanges, importers, international and inter-provincial transportation businesses, and state-owned or joint state-private profit-making enterprises. The legislative process has been completed and collection will begin soon. (5) Planning for a one-time property tax, which was decided in the Emergency Restoration Measures Case in February last year. The Ministry has been actively planning in accordance with the original plan, but the collection of property tax is aimed at the wealth of the people across the country. Without a precise property survey and sound household administration as a foundation, it would be difficult to achieve fairness, and there would inevitably be many obstacles in the implementation process. In order to implement the decision carefully, the Ministry believes that thorough consideration must be given during the planning process, and technical difficulties must be resolved. After careful research, four collection methods were proposed and submitted to the government for approval. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan approved the implementation of a national property registration first, and then the taxation based on the registered data, ordered to be handled by the Ministry in conjunction with the Ministry of Interior. Relevant agencies were invited to discuss the implementation steps and actively promote it. Recently, in order to cooperate with the economic emergency measures plan, considering that property registration is too slow to solve the urgent need, the method of property tax collection has been re-examined, and a tax collection target has been formulated, using both individuals and objects, first levying a proportional tax once on several important and easily controlled properties (such as land, houses, foreign exchange, etc.), and then levying a progressive tax on the property of individuals and legal entities exceeding a certain limit, in order to comply with the principle of ability to pay. This plan has been submitted to the government and will be implemented after approval.</p>
<p>In terms of customs duties, the government has adjusted them several times last year in order to cooperate with foreign exchange management and the development of trade policy. Initially, the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade were promulgated with the opening of the foreign exchange market, dividing imported goods into three categories: free import, permitted import, and prohibited import, in order to regulate imports. At the same time, it was stipulated that, except for a few items that require special permission, all exports are allowed to be freely converted into foreign exchange to promote exports. Later, due to price reasons, domestic goods could not be sold smoothly, and in August, foreign exchange was re-adjusted to cancel export taxes to encourage exports. After that, due to too many imports and a large trade deficit, the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade were revised again in November, and a comprehensive import licensing system was implemented. Domestic production enterprises were given priority for the import of necessary goods or raw materials, as well as other materials with legitimate uses, and non-essential goods were either prohibited or suspended from import. The purpose of repeated adjustments is to restrict imports and encourage exports in order to balance international trade. In total, the total value of imported goods last year was 150.12 billion, and the total value of exports was 41.21 billion, with a trade deficit of 109.9 billion (approximately US$325 million). Although this trade deficit figure is very large, an analysis of imported goods shows that cotton, , gasoline, vehicles, steel machinery , rubber, and paper are the main items, followed by electrical materials, metal ingots, chemical drugs, and leather, which are all urgently needed materials during the restoration period. Since the implementation of the export promotion and comprehensive import licensing system, international trade has been implemented according to the government's economic construction plan, and unnecessary materials have been greatly reduced. Statistics show that as of the end of March this year, the total value of imported goods was more than 797.5 billion, and the total value of exports was more than 275.2 billion. The trade deficit has obviously decreased compared with before the implementation of the comprehensive import licensing system. However, import control is only a temporary expedient. To balance international trade and payments, a strict tariff is the fundamental solution. Regarding this matter, the Ministry has conducted long-term research and preparation, and recently the legislative principles for import and export tariffs have been promulgated as the basis for revision. In the future, import and export tariffs will reduce or exempt taxes on the import of industrial and agricultural equipment, machinery, instruments, tools, accessories, and medical equipment that cannot be manufactured domestically and whose supply is insufficient. For domestic processing of handicrafts and machinery industries, those whose finished products are sold abroad will be given a tax refund on the imported raw materials or semi-finished products. For people's livelihood necessities with insufficient domestic supply, a lighter import tax will be levied or refunded. For imported goods that compete with domestic infant industries that should be protected, a heavier import tax will be levied, and luxury goods will be subject to a prohibitive import tax. As for exports, export tax rates will be exempted or reduced for those that should be encouraged. These principles are also based on the obligations accepted by China at the World Trade Industry Conference to properly set tariffs and put them into practice. In the future, import and export trade can be properly adjusted.</p>
<p>In terms of salt tax, the current edible salt is produced, transported, and sold by the people in accordance with the "Salt Administration Outline" in early 1946, with free sales, free trade, and the government only adjusting production and sales. The current salt tax applies a differential tax rate, which is divided into four levels according to the production cost of each region in the country. In addition, in terms of salt affairs, the following important measures have been taken to cooperate with the economic production policy: (1) Actively organize and start work on the received salt fields and salt factories to make full use of them. (2) Pay attention to the industrialization of production, improve salt areas, and reduce costs. (3) Industrial salt, whether private or state-owned, is completely tax-free, and fishery salt adopts a light tax policy. (4) Accumulated salt along the coast is transported to Japan in exchange for construction materials to develop economic construction.</p>
<p>In terms of commodity tax, in order to comply with the principle of heavy taxation of luxury goods and to meet the needs of economic construction, the commodity tax rates have been adjusted. Among them, the tax rates for luxury goods such as foreign wine, beer, local wine, and local tobacco have been increased by 20% to 40% respectively. At the same time, the Mineral Resources Tax Regulations were formulated, and the tax rate for coal and iron was reduced from 5% to 3% to reduce the burden on national defense industry and daily life, while the tax rate for the main raw materials of porcelain clay, copper, tin, etc., was reduced from 10% to 5%. In addition, the principle of export tax refund is adopted for all export consolidated tax commodities to encourage exports. In order to increase tax revenue last year, seven consolidated taxes were implemented for wheat flour, cement, tea, fur, tin foil and superstitious paper, beverages, and cosmetics. Different tax rates are formulated separately by carefully examining the nature of various commodities and the affordability of consumers, in order to increase treasury revenue and promote the implementation of economic policies.</p>
<p>Financial administration has also been actively rectified in the past year, seeking to cooperate with the work of improving the tax system. The efforts are: (1) Streamlining the organization. Regarding this point, your council has already made a resolution in the last session, requesting the government to earnestly handle it. The Ministry has implemented it according to the plan, and has merged more than 150 tax bureaus and units under its jurisdiction in one year, reducing the number of personnel by 16,965. It is planned to continue the adjustment in the future. (2) Punishing corruption. Regarding the issue of investigating the discipline of tax officials under its jurisdiction, the Ministry has sent inspectors to various regions to conduct regular investigations and examine all corruption and illegal events. Whether it is people's complaints or inspection reports, once verified, they will be strictly investigated. From April last year to the present, more than 300 personnel of subordinate agencies have been dismissed or suspended. (3) Strictly implementing the examination system. In conjunction with the Examination Yuan, a special financial officer examination was held to recruit outstanding young people from all sides to enrich the tax organization. It has been held twice in the past year, and it will be established as a system from now on, and will be selected and supplemented year by year, in the hope of achieving the goal of strictly examining and selecting, improving quality, and reforming personnel.

<h3>Stability Around Changchun and Jilin; Communist Main Force Attacks Siping; Chen Mingren and Liu Donghan Vow to Defend to the Death</h3>
<p>[Report from Shenyang by this Newspaper on the 24th] Siping is in critical condition. The Communist troops are approaching the urban area. Fierce fighting broke out in the suburbs three miles away at dusk on the 24th, with continuous artillery fire. Chen Mingren and Liu Donghan jointly telegraphed various leaders in Nanjing and other places, vowing to defend the territory to the death.</p>
<p>[Report from Changchun by this Newspaper on the 24th] The main force of the Communist troops gathered west of the Changchun-Siping section of the China Chang Railway has now split into several routes to harass the area. The general outline of the unpredictable war situation has emerged. The three divisions, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, of the Communist First Column, and a part of the Second Column, have secretly crossed the Dongbian River and are moving south, attempting to attack Siping. More than 4,000 troops of the Communist Independent Second Division were attracted to the vicinity of Shuangyang in the southeast of Changchun by the National Army crossing the Dongliao River northward. Fierce fighting broke out in the suburbs of Shuangyang yesterday. The troops disturbing the outskirts of Changchun are only about 10,000, which is obviously a containment effort. About 4,000 troops in the northwest of Changchun, and about 5,000 troops between Gongzhuling and Fanjia Village on the China Chang Railway, are not worth worrying about. According to authoritative military sources, the Communist troops attacking Siping will definitely suffer a serious blow, and a major battle will unfold near Siping. As for the Communist troops harassing Shuangyang, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. There is no need to worry about the defense of Changchun City. Another telegram: The Dongliao River railway bridge, a vital transportation hub on the China Chang Railway between Siping and Gongzhuling, is still intact according to reliable information, and is being guarded by elite troops of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Report from Shenkai by this Newspaper on the 24th] The outskirts of Changchun and Jilin are stable, Siping is becoming tighter. Most of the Communist troops are approaching Siping from the vicinity of Guojiadian and Wushu. Dozens of Communist troops have also been found south and east of Siping, such as in Bakagou and Jiangshanzizi. It is heard that the Communist troops besieging Siping, in addition to those coming from the south of Gongzhuling, have also transferred five divisions from Changchun South Yitong and Fanjia Village to attempt to take Siping early, and then attack Changchun and Jilin.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Panjian section of the Beining Railway has been open since the 24th. The damaged sections near Suizhong have been repaired.</p>
<p>[Report from Changchun by Central News Agency on the 24th] The air passage here has been reopened today by the landing of several transport aircraft. All supplies no longer need to be delivered by difficult airdrops. Although the reopening of the air passage is not enough to indicate a thorough improvement in the war situation here, the depression of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians for the past ten days has been greatly relieved. At 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, hundreds of Communist troops sneaked into Daguyushu Village, eight miles southwest of Changchun. The National Army returned with fierce artillery fire, and the Communist troops retreated without support.</p>
<p>[Report from Jilin by Central News Agency on the 3rd] The defending troops of Laoye Ridge, which is isolated behind the Communist troops and 60 kilometers east of Jilin, were ordered to transfer their positions.</p>
<p>[Report from Fanyang by Central News Agency on the 23rd] About 5,000 to 6,000 Communist troops attacked the line from Lishu to Guojiadian (25 kilometers north of Siping) on the evening of the 22nd. About 800 troops broke into Lishu County, but were annihilated by the defending troops. Fierce fighting is currently taking place outside the city.</p>
<p>Communist Offensive Frustrated at Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>[Report from Beiping by this Newspaper on the 24th] The offensive of the Communist troops attacking the stations of Beidaihe, Nandasi, and Qinhuangdao on the Beining Line has been frustrated since the arrival of reinforcements from the National Army this afternoon. The two armies are now engaged in fierce fighting in Haiyang Town, Wangjiatun, and other places nearby. The rumor that the Communist troops landed in Beidaihe cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p>[Report from Tianjin by Central News Agency on the 24th] Qinhuangdao's outer defenses were suddenly attacked by Communist troops on the 22nd. The National Army, which went from Changli to reinforce, crossed Liushouying on the evening of the 23rd and launched a fierce counterattack against the Communist troops. The National Army in Changli and Qinhuangdao has now completed a pincer movement against the Communist troops and will be able to defeat them.</p>
<p>[Report from Baoding by Central News Agency on the 24th] More than 3,000 Communist troops sneaked into the area west of Linyu West Haiyang Town in eastern Hebei on the 22nd and attacked the strongholds of Qingshishan, Paotongshan, and Beidaihe in the early morning of the 23rd. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Report from United Press, Tianjin on the 24th] A U.S. Navy landing craft has arrived in Beidaihe today to evacuate the four American civilians living in the area. Approximately 200 Marines are currently stationed in Qinhuangdao, guarding naval property awaiting shipment.</p>
<h3>New Battles Brewing in Central Shandong; Communist Troops Retreat to Eastern Yimeng Mountain Area</h3>
<p>[Report from Xuzhou by this Newspaper on the 24th] A decisive battle between the main forces in central Shandong is actively brewing in the northern foothills of the Yimeng Mountain area. The Communist First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Columns, and a part of the Second Column, are now gathered in the southeast of Boshan and the east of Laiwu and Xintai, and are holding a military conference. Both sides are currently engaged in new deployments. It is expected that the scale of future battles may be larger than before, and the National Army will deal a decisive blow to the main forces of the Communist troops in central Shandong and on the Jiaoji Railway Line. In addition, the families and logistics of the Communist troops in central Shandong have been moving north of the Jiaoji Railway Line in recent days.</p>
<p>[Report from Jinan by this Newspaper on the 24th] The main force of the Lu Communist troops, which once fled north to Zibo, has now returned to the eastern Yimeng Mountain area. Its distribution area includes Yue Zhuang, the headquarters of the East China Field Army, and the vicinity of Yishui Northwest, where the First, Second, and Fifth Columns are stationed. The Fourth Column is stationed in Qingshanpu north of Yishui, the Eighth and Ninth Columns are stationed in Yishui, the Sixth Column is stationed in Tanbu, and the Third Column is stationed in Dazhangzhuang East Laiwu. The area north of Boshan and Tusikou is occupied by a part of the Tenth Column, while its main force is in Zouping.

<h3>Zhang Qun's Full Report - Continued</h3>
<p>In terms of the economy, as a temporary solution, the Economic Emergency Measures Program has yielded considerable results in the three months since its promulgation. However, some parts of this program have not yet been implemented, and others must be supplemented and revised due to changing circumstances. For example, adjustments to the cost of living index for workers and the lifting of rice price controls are both variations from the original plan. Some have criticized this plan or offered other solutions, but any solution, upon careful discussion, has its advantages and disadvantages. The plan itself was never meant to be immutable. Until we find a better solution, we can only adopt this one, supplementing and revising it with the experience gained during its implementation to make it fit the actual needs. Regarding the six essential daily necessities that must be controlled under the original plan, China's rice production has always been insufficient to meet its own needs, and cotton yarn and cloth are even more deficient, requiring imports. Coal production is mainly concentrated in the Northeast and North China; even Guangdong's coal consumption relies on North China. Currently, many of China's coal mines have been destroyed by the Communist Party. If we can conserve usage, we can barely manage. After prohibiting the export of cooking oil and its raw materials, the current supply does not seem to be lacking. As for salt and sugar, there are no problems with either. The above-mentioned six items are all basic necessities of life, and there are reasonable plans and management for their production, transportation, and supply. If domestic production is insufficient, we must seek it from abroad to avoid shortages. However, from another perspective, before the war, China had trade surpluses only during the First World War; otherwise, it consistently had trade deficits. After eight years of war, our industry is dilapidated, and agricultural production has decreased. This year's international balance of payments has a significant deficit. Even including remittances from overseas Chinese on the income side, we can only offset half of the expenditures. This is a very dangerous phenomenon for the nation. To ensure the basic living needs of the people, we must buy foreign rice, foreign wheat, foreign yarn, and foreign cloth. However, if items are not essential for life, we should not waste the nation's foreign exchange. Therefore, the government must restrict imports and provide as much assistance as possible to exports. If there are difficulties in exporting goods, it is best for the government to purchase them, even at a loss. We are currently planning to use this policy to increase exports, which can, on the one hand, compensate for expenditures. Regarding subsidy policies, the original intention was to avoid reducing the stimulus for prices. Currently, opinions on this policy vary, with three main arguments, each with its own justification, which are currently under consideration. However, the various methods mentioned above are still insufficient for the nation's needs. Any promising country or nation that wants to transition from an agricultural nation to an industrial nation, or seeks rapid recovery after a foreign war, must have its entire population tighten their belts, foregoing enjoyment that they could afford, and use it to acquire the means of production from abroad. With this spirit of austerity, they can accumulate surplus wealth and concentrate it on construction. We can find many precedents in modern nations. For us to transform from an agricultural nation to an industrial nation, and to rebuild a new China after the devastation of war, we truly rely on being half as capable as others, but working twice as hard. If our spirit of hard work and thrift cannot achieve the goal of national construction, then the cultivation of this spirit cannot rely solely on laws and regulations. Therefore, in addition to the government working towards this direction, social figures must also jointly create this kind of national awareness and atmosphere to be effective. The Economic Emergency Measures Program is mostly a temporary solution. Even if implemented effectively, it can only alleviate rising prices. To fundamentally improve China's economy and increase production, we must, on the one hand, support private economic enterprises, and on the other hand, welcome foreign investment. Regarding support for private enterprises, the government is now not only providing assistance to existing essential private enterprises but is also selling off state-owned enterprises as much as possible to transform them into private enterprises. Based on the principles of the People's Livelihood and its socialization, we will determine the future direction of handling all economic issues, with state capital as the center, leading the activity of private capital, assigning difficult tasks to state-owned enterprises and assisting private enterprises in easier tasks. In terms of utilizing foreign capital, a country that has been devastated by war and wants to quickly recover and rebuild must welcome foreign investment. Looking at other victorious countries in the world, except for the United States, countries like Britain, the Soviet Union, and France all have to seek assistance from abroad. China was originally poor, and the direct and indirect losses of public and private property during the eight years of war, as listed earlier, are truly shocking. We certainly rely on foreign debt to make up for the overspending in the national budget, but our vast territory needs to immediately begin economic recovery and construction work. The costs required for this work are naturally beyond our existing national financial resources and social capacity. Based on this situation, loans from the United States are of utmost importance. The government will proceed according to the policy direction after the reorganization of the government, that is, foreign debt must be used to stabilize and improve the people's lives and for productive construction. As for the balance of national and local fiscal revenues and expenditures, we must continue to strive based on our belief in self-reliance. As for the entire economic reform issue, our Yuan has drafted a plan, which is being submitted to the National Government for review. How this plan will be implemented in the future is up to the National Economic Commission, which has been established for this purpose. Because regular administrative organizations are divided based on various specialized administrative tasks or technologies, there are seven or eight departments in the various ministries of the Executive Yuan whose duties are related to economic matters. Without an organization to strengthen the connection between these departments, it would be difficult to maintain a consistent pace, which would affect policy implementation. Promoting production and construction requires even more coordination. Therefore, in today's extremely serious economic situation, it is necessary to combine relevant business or technical experts from society with the competent authorities in the government, so that they can gather their wisdom and work together under one organization, a specific policy, and the principle of division of labor and cooperation. Although this organization is proposed by the government, the focus is on social, industrial, and business leaders and specialized economic talents. Without this, it would be difficult to cope with the current serious situation, let alone planned reform. Currently, there are educational problems.</p>
<h3>Educational Problems</h3>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the government in the rear areas never slackened on education, but due to wartime financial difficulties, transportation obstacles, incomplete school facilities, and the lack of peace of mind for teachers and students, although the number of schools and students increased during the war, the level of education was actually lower than before the war. This spiritual loss has a more lasting impact than material losses, and there has been no improvement after the end of the war. I have always participated in educational undertakings. After arriving at the Yuan, I invited the presidents, deans, and professors of various schools in the capital to tea parties to listen to the difficulties currently faced by the schools and opinions on improving education, which serve as the basis for the government's educational policies. Unexpectedly, recently in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, some university students have gathered for petitions and demonstrations over issues such as subsidies for public-funded students, food costs, school administration, and the academic system, even seizing vehicles, obstructing traffic, occupying institutions, and hindering public affairs. Many of the frivolous and insulting attitudes are too unbearable to describe. To build a nation, we must first build the people. If the atmosphere among young students continues to deteriorate like this, the talent shortage in China will be even more profound and widespread ten years later. This hidden worry is truly unimaginable. Tracing the root cause, it is a misinterpretation of freedom. Special attention must be paid to this issue in the current constitutional preparation stage. We should exert the spirit of the Constitution as much as possible. Any freedom granted to the people in the Constitution should be granted to the people as early as possible. But on the other hand, the state needs laws, and society needs order. Therefore, the people's spirit of abiding by the law and their sense of responsibility to the country must also increase in proportion to the freedom they enjoy. Only then can freedom and the rule of law complement each other and become a modern democratic country. This kind of character of abiding by laws and discipline, valuing order, and being self-respecting and patriotic should be led by intellectual youths for the general public, spreading from schools to society. If the youths who are currently receiving education in schools do not have a clear understanding and are unrestrained, how can we expect the general public's atmosphere to improve? Therefore, the government must fully protect the freedoms that the people should enjoy, but to maintain social tranquility, it is necessary to take measures to restrict overstepping behavior when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Today's youths in school are all future nation-building cadres. The country hopes that they will have profound knowledge and, in particular, hopes that they will have rigorous integrity. Therefore, we must cherish today's youths in school, cultivate their knowledge and virtue, so that they can stand on their own feet and be able to shoulder the mission of nation-building after leaving school. The government, school teachers, and family elders should jointly bear this responsibility.</p>
<p>To strengthen school facilities, stabilize the lives of teachers, and reward and assist private educational undertakings are measures that the government should take. If you, the councilors, have any opinions, please provide guidance. I have been appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan during this difficult time, and I am truly cautious and apprehensive about my abilities. I can only do my best to seek some benefit for national affairs. I don't have any genius, and I won't create miracles. Faced with the current difficult situation, what is the most correct and effective solution? In addition to the government exhausting its efforts, we also need all of you, the councilors, to plan together and provide more guidance! (End)</p>
<h3>Zuo Shunsheng Reports on Agricultural and Forestry Administration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng's report at the Political Council was mostly factual, without involving plans or policies. Zuo first stated that he had only been in office for nine days, and the previous report had already been made by Minister Zhou Qian, so he would not elaborate further. Zuo then touched on the history and funding of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, stating: Since the establishment of the Ministry seven years ago, there have been a total of six ministers, including himself, which can be said to be frequent personnel changes. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's funding only accounts for five per thousand of the total budget, so from the perspective of personnel and funding, it has not been valued in the administrative system. However, I am not pessimistic. Firstly, because the various matters under the Ministry of Agriculture are related to everyone's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and secondly, the organization of the Ministry has already been established, with a total of seven departments and two committees, as well as various research institutes, etc., waiting to be filled in the future, so there is hope for the future.</p>
<p>Zuo continued: I believe that: Firstly, academic institutions and technical personnel in villages will not be changed. Any faction will value talent and will not favor the Youth Party. Secondly, research work should be strengthened to seek improvement and to establish close contact with specialized talents. Zuo then presented an incomplete statistic stating that there are approximately 15,000 specialized talents in agriculture nationwide, but currently, less than 5,000 are employed in this field. I intend to enable these 10,000 people who do not have opportunities to each find their place and make the best use of their talents, entrusting limited funding to the most reliable people to manage and develop agricultural and forestry undertakings. Thirdly, I hope that people nationwide can understand the work of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Zuo then presented several examples from the Ministry, hoping that the councilors could visit them: The first is the work of the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group, which was formed in June 1946, composed of ten American experts and thirteen Chinese experts. After eleven weeks of studying Chinese agriculture and forestry, they returned to Beijing and spent five weeks writing a report based on their findings. The group focused on three objectives: (1) Chinese agricultural and forestry education, (2) Chinese agricultural production and marketing, and (3) the utilization of living water and soil, which are extremely applicable. The second is the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, which is divided into ten departments and carries out work with extremely limited funding, only 1 billion yuan per year. The third is the Agricultural Production Improvement Office, which was established in January of this year. Its working goal for this year is to restore the 52 million mu of cotton fields that existed before the war and produce 12.5 million dan of improved Sino-American cotton seeds, of which 7.28 million dan are for spinning machines. The fourth is the Tobacco Improvement Institute, with a tobacco loan of 15.6 billion yuan and processing of 12.4 billion yuan this year. Most of this funding is provided to Henan for tobacco improvement, and a small portion is provided to Anhui.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Announces Limited Opening Hours for Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon and Responsible Compensation for Land Requisitioned in the Expansion Area</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 24th Dispatch] The Hong Kong government today announced new rules limiting the opening hours of Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon due to the current shortage of staff.

<h3>Provincial Orders for Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou to Quickly Implement Grain Storage and Price Stabilization, and a Rice-Snatching Riot Occurred Outside Zhenjiang's West Gate Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 24th Dispatch] From 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 24th, a rice-snatching riot occurred continuously outside Zhenjiang's West Gate, involving three stores: Yi Ming in Shanxiang Lane, Ying Yu in Xinma Road, and Fu Ming in Zeta Road. The loss of rice was about ten or more dan. The rice snatchers were all common people who lived by the dan and sheng, because the stores deliberately increased the selling price, which aroused public outrage. Fortunately, the military and police arrived to suppress the riot, and the rice-snatching crowd dispersed, restoring order. After the incident, the provincial and county authorities not only dispatched military and police to key locations to maintain order but also held separate meetings to discuss follow-up measures and decided to: (1) Issue a public notice to reassure the people, urging rice merchants to recognize the greater good and not to raise prices. (2) Organize price stabilization sales. (3) Make every effort to dredge the grain supply. (4) Order all rice stores to resume business on the 25th, with the price not to exceed 245,000 yuan per dan. Chairman Wang attached great importance to this and slowly patrolled the entire city for a week in a military vehicle. Also, He Yushu, Director of the Provincial Land and Food Administration, in order to ensure the safety of the people's livelihood, specially ordered the three counties of Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou to not only allocate a portion of their stored grain but also to quickly implement price stabilization sales of local grain. It is now decided that Zhenjiang will set up one price stabilization sales point in each of the east, south, west, north, and central areas starting from June 1, with each household limited to purchasing three sheng, and the selling price is stipulated to be 3% to 5% lower than the market price.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 24th Dispatch] Rice prices have soared in recent days, rising another 60,000 yuan today compared to yesterday, with a price of 382,500 yuan.

Also, the method of selling rice and flour at stabilized prices in this county has been decided to be based on household registration. Applications will be made to the township offices, and then purchases will be made to prevent scalping.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 24th Dispatch] Since the Central Government ordered the restoration of negotiated grain prices and abolished price limits, Suzhou's grain prices have risen from 140,000 yuan to 330,000 yuan in more than 20 days. The Suzhou County government has telegraphed the provincial government to request instructions from the Central Government on future measures.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Trends</h3>
<p>After the Yoshida Cabinet in Japan resigned on the 20th, who would succeed as Prime Minister became the focus of world attention. The House of Representatives and the House of Councillors elected a Prime Minister on the 23rd, and as a result, the leader of the Socialist Party, Katayama, was elected and took office as Prime Minister yesterday. He has begun meeting with the leaders of the Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, and the People's Cooperative Party to discuss the formation of a four-party coalition cabinet. It is expected that the new cabinet will be established within the next week. The future trends of Japanese politics are certainly worthy of our close attention.</p>
<p>Japan's new constitution has been in effect since May 3rd. The newly elected parliament convened on the 20th, and looking at the election of the speaker and the prime minister over the past few days, the political situation has become clearer. The parliament, established under the new constitution, consists of the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives, with the House of Representatives holding a more important position. The Prime Minister is jointly elected by both houses. The first session of the House of Councillors under the new constitution was held on the 20th, with Matsudaira elected as the President of the House and Socialist Party member Matsudaira Jiichirō elected as Vice President. The House of Representatives convened on the 21st, with Socialist Party member Matsuoka Komakichi elected as the President of the House and Democratic Party member Tanaka Man-itsu elected as Vice President. Due to the Socialist Party's victory in the parliamentary speaker elections, Katayama's election as Prime Minister laid a solid foundation. At the continued meeting of the upper house on the 23rd, Katayama Tetsu of the Socialist Party was elected Prime Minister with a landslide victory of 420 votes to 6 in the House of Representatives and 205 votes to 2 in the House of Councillors. This is a new turning point in Japanese politics and the beginning of building a new Japan.</p>
<p>The Socialist Party of Japan was founded on November 2, 1945, and was the first political party established after Japan's surrender. It advocates social democracy, and some mistakenly refer to it as the "Social Democratic Party." Although the party has a short history, it is the successor to the pre-war Social Masses Party and the Labor-Farmer Party, with socialist Isoo Abe as its guiding spirit. Japanese socialism has many factions and new ideas, so since the establishment of the Socialist Party, there has been a division between the left and right wings. Generally speaking, the right wing is centered on Suehiro Nishio, Rikizo Hirano, and Komakichi Matsuoka, while the left wing is centered on Chozaburo Mizutani, Ju Kato, and Mosaburo Suzuki. The important principles of the party platform are threefold: (1) to be a combination of the working class, with the aim of ensuring political freedom and a democratic system; (2) to reject capitalism, implement socialism, and strive to stabilize and improve the national livelihood; and (3) to oppose all militaristic ideas and actions, and cooperate with all countries in the world to achieve lasting peace. Based on the spirit of this platform, eleven policies were decided on September 28th of last year. The ideas expressed in its demands for political, economic, and social systems are close to the policies of the British Labour Party. The method is gradual, the means are peaceful, there is no extremism of the Communist Party, and there is no continuous struggle of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, democracy criticizes it as social democracy, and communism criticizes it as reformist socialism. In fact, the policy spirit is social reformism. When the Socialist Party was first established, Tetsu Katayama was the party's secretary-general and later became chairman, serving as the de facto party leader. He was born in Wakayama Prefecture in 1887 and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University in 1912. He has presided over the "Legal Consultation Office," "Legal Newspaper," and the legal department of the General Federation of Labor. After that, he participated in the Farmer-Labor Party, the Social Masses Party, and the Social Masses Academy, and once launched the National Labor Party, which was soon dissolved. In 1942, the Tojo Cabinet implemented the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association," and Katayama was not recommended, resulting in his failure to run for a seat in the House of Representatives in that election. As for his retreat to the countryside under the autocratic politics of military fascism, he devoted himself to reading and did not ask about politics until Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration. He is sixty years old this year and has thirty-six years of history in political and social movements. He has never entered officialdom, engaged in commerce or industry, or taught at a university, and has only been elected to the House of Representatives five times. Katayama's election as Prime Minister this time can be called the world's second "commoner prime minister."</p>
<p>Japanese politics, since the Meiji era, has been centered on the bourgeoisie, aristocrats, and military cliques. In the past forty-six cabinets, the prime ministers all came from the ranks of aristocrats, generals, or bureaucrats. The only "commoner prime minister" from the people was Inukai Tsuyoshi. However, Inukai was a spokesperson for the financial clique, and his ideas and ambitions cannot compare with those of Katayama today. Katayama is indeed an extraordinary figure in Japanese social movements and politics, and MacArthur has also praised him as an ideal democrat. In Japan, one year and nine months after the surrender, the Socialist Party's rapid rise, gaining the position of the first party in the Diet, and obtaining the position of "overseeing all officials" in the new cabinet is by no means accidental. First, the Liberal Party has been in power for years, and its misdeeds are obvious, and complaints are everywhere. Yoshida succeeded in courting MacArthur, but there is still no clue about the recovery of society and the economy and the progress of Japan's reconstruction work. Katayama is a new figure in politics, with perseverance and ability. Observing his remarks just ten minutes after being elected Prime Minister: "I am extremely grateful to be unanimously elected Prime Minister by all members of the Diet today. In order to overcome the crisis of the Japanese nation and build a new Japan, I will do my best with sincerity." His words are earnest and leap off the page. Second, Katayama's complete victory in both houses of the Diet is indeed what the people want. Katayama's agreement to form a cabinet with the Democratic Party and the People's Cooperative Party has been reached. Only the Liberal Party stands in opposition, but many Liberal Party members in both houses still voted to support Katayama, which shows that although there are differences in party interests in Japan, when facing great difficulties, the whole country is united.</p>
<p>According to sources in Tokyo, Katayama's cabinet formation work will begin on the 26th. Katayama is determined to form a coalition government of four parties based on established policies and guidelines. Whether the Liberal Party will join the cabinet is doubtful. If Katayama completely loses the cooperation of conservative forces, there will be many obstacles in the future. Because today's conservative forces control important sectors of society and the economy, as well as local administration and parliament. However, Katayama has the魄力 and has 手腕, and has considerable support from MacArthur. It is expected that Katayama will win the hearts of the people and overcome this difficulty. In short, the Japanese political situation has gradually become clear after months of elections and evolution. Relations with the United States are becoming more and more smooth, and foreign trade will also be restored. Only the response to the peace treaty with Japan remains to be arranged by the new government.</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Holds Meeting, Approves Indian Viceroy's Plan, Partition of India Seems Inevitable, Rumor Mountbatten to Return to India Next Thursday to Resume Post</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The negotiations between Indian Viceroy Mountbatten and the British Cabinet ended today. The Cabinet meeting has approved the Viceroy's plan to submit a document to Indian leaders on June 2 regarding the process of transferring political power. The Viceroy did not attend the Cabinet meeting, but he did meet with the Commerce Minister of the Indian Provisional Government, Zontrija of the Muslim League, and Nehru's personal representative in London, Menon, to listen to the opinions of both India and the Muslim League. At the same time, Prime Minister Attlee has informed the leaders of various opposition parties of the general outline of the Viceroy's plan. The reaction of Churchill and other Conservative Party leaders is not yet known, but Liberal Party leader Davis has expressed his agreement with the plan. The government stated that Parliament has adjourned today, and the content of the Viceroy's plan will be formally announced after the Viceroy presents it to Indian leaders at a meeting in Delhi.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] It is reported that Mountbatten will return to his post in India next Thursday and will consult with the Cabinet again before his departure.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] Although the British Cabinet has approved Viceroy Mountbatten's plan today, some Indian people expect that it will be difficult to establish a complete solution before June of next year, the deadline for Britain's withdrawal from India. The Chairman of the Indian Constituent Assembly, Chinglara, stated that the Muslim League Chairman Jinnah's request to obtain a corridor in Hindustan territory for the eastern and western parts of Pakistan is an unacceptable proposal. Benzheyou, Delhi, the United Provinces, Bihar, and part of Bengal will inevitably be cut off, with a distance of 1,600 kilometers, passing through areas that are all non-Muslim. Jinsalasa expressed his hatred for the partition of India, but said that if the decision is made to implement the partition, the Congress Party will demand the partition of the two provinces of Bengal and Benzhebu. Pu also recognized that after the partition of India, the division of the army would inevitably be unavoidable. In addition, Modi, the leader of India's wealthiest Parsee community, also expressed opposition to the partition of India, because after the partition, the status of both Pakistan and Hindustan would be weakened, reducing India's importance in the world. The Muslim League Liaison Department announced today that it has sent a telegram to Prime Minister Attlee, Indian Affairs Minister Listowel, and Viceroy Mountbatten, asking them to uphold justice for 30 million Muslims.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Generally speaking, it is expected that although the British government will re-submit the British internal Indian federal plan to Indian leaders, the partition of India is unavoidable. They also believe that if the partition is indeed unavoidable, the opinions of the representatives of the Indian people must be sought in a democratic way. As far as the Congress Party, the Sikhs, the Indian Christians, and some native states are concerned, the existing Constituent Assembly is sufficient as an institution for seeking opinions. However, as far as the Muslims are concerned, because the Muslim League boycotts the Constituent Assembly, another Muslim League Constituent Assembly must be established. Regarding the partition of the two provinces of Bengal and Benzhebu, it seems that a referendum must be held to decide, and the problem of the Northwest Frontier Province also needs to be decided by a special method. British officials all believe that time is the main factor in the Viceroy's procedural plan, and it is almost impossible to hold a referendum nationwide. British officials reiterated that all decisions will be made by Indian leaders. If Indian leaders agree with the plan proposed by the Viceroy, then future constitutional decisions should also be made by Indian leaders.</p>
<h3>Katayama Elected Prime Minister, MacArthur Highly Praises, Katayama Expresses Great Pleasure, Saying It Will Help Cabinet Formation</h3>
<p>[International Dispatch to Tokyo, 24th] Katayama drove to visit MacArthur at 5:30 p.m. on the 24th, making his first visit after taking office as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] After the leader of the Japanese Socialist Party, Katayama, was elected Prime Minister, MacArthur immediately issued a public statement, saying that Katayama leading the country as a Christian leader is a groundbreaking event in Japanese history, reflecting Japan's complete tolerance of religion. The other two major leaders in Asian countries, namely Chinese Chairman Chiang and Philippine President Roxas, are both Christians. Katayama's election as Prime Minister proves that the Japanese are pursuing non-extremist policies. The international propaganda that Japan's recent election was a victory for reactionary forces is self-defeating. Tetsu Katayama expressed great pleasure with MacArthur's statement. He said: "If the leaders of other political parties carefully study MacArthur's statement, then my work in forming a new cabinet will be easier. My initial wish is to establish a government that can contribute to world peace and Japanese happiness. I have never had the desire to become Prime Minister by unreasonable means."</p>
<p>Former and New Prime Ministers Hand Over Yesterday</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Prime Minister's appointment ceremony was held at the Imperial Palace at 5 p.m. on the 24th. The Yoshida Cabinet held two cabinet meetings at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. today to discuss the handover between the former and new Prime Ministers. After that, the Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, Irie, invited representatives from the Socialist Party to discuss. As a result, it was decided to hand over immediately. Yoshida entered the palace at 4 p.m. to report the Diet's appointment of Katayama as Prime Minister. The new Prime Minister's appointment ceremony was held at 5 p.m. Former Prime Minister Yoshida and the speakers of both houses, Komakichi Matsuoka and Tsuneo Matsudaira, attended the ceremony.</p>
<p>Yoshida Claims Illness, Refuses Meeting</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Prime Minister Katayama originally planned to meet with the presidents of various parties on the 25th to request their cooperation in cabinet formation work, but because Liberal Party President Yoshida refused to meet on the grounds of physical discomfort, the planned meeting had to be postponed again. The Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Ohno, declared on the 24th: "The Katayama Cabinet has no intention of inviting the Liberal Party to join the cabinet. If the policies agreed upon by the secretaries-general of the four parties are implemented, our party will cooperate outside the cabinet." As for the internal situation of the Democratic Party, it is also very complicated. The reason why it repeatedly demanded the formation of a four-party coalition cabinet is said to be a means by the Shidehara faction to put the Katayama Cabinet in a state of stillbirth. Although Ashida and Nishio had a meeting on the 22nd and had a considerable understanding of the formation of a three-party coalition cabinet, the result may only be the formation of a two-and-a-half-party coalition cabinet of the Socialist, National Cooperative, and the Tada faction of the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party will inevitably split internally.</p>
<h3>Katayama Weak, Emperor Greatly Concerned</h3>
<p>[International News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Speaker of the House of Representatives Matsuoka had an audience with the Emperor at 3:50 p.m. on the 24th and, when reporting on the process of the House of Representatives' election of the Prime Minister, had the following exchange with the Emperor: (Emperor) It is reported that Katayama is quite weak. What is the Speaker's opinion? (Matsuoka) What is said is indeed true. Katayama is quite weak when in a position of being attacked, but if given proper protection, he will develop an unexpectedly strong style. (Emperor) Before the cabinet formation work is completed, the political affairs will only be managed by the Minister of _____. Can Katayama handle it alone? (Matsuoka) Katayama should select cabinet members to assist him as soon as possible within the realm of possibility. (Emperor) Will it take two weeks to form a cabinet? (Matsuoka) The political situation does not allow such a delay. We should strive to achieve its establishment within a few days.</p>
<h3>Unrest Continues in India, Severe Damage in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] Today is the Sikh's great religious festival. The capital of Punjab Province, Lahore, is under strict guard to prevent incidents from occurring. In the Northwest Frontier Province, unrest continues to occur. Demonstrators from the Muslim League in Mardan, the capital of the province, destroyed the city hall. Many villages' tax offices were also destroyed. Members of the Muslim League in Peshawar, the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, continued to march and demonstrate to show their opposition to the province's Congress Party government. They once attacked the outer wall of Warden Prison, and Xiangshui Pond outside the city was bombed and suffered minor damage. Since the riots in Lahore on May 14th, ____108 people have been killed, and property losses are estimated at ____1 million pounds. 150 houses have been burned, including more than ten Hindu and Sikh temples, as well as the residence of the largest landlord in Punjab Province. About 5,000 Hindus are evacuating Lahore every day, and Hindu-owned businesses and banks are planning to relocate to Delhi. A bomb exploded in Amritsar, the holy city of the Sikhs, yesterday.</p>
<h3>British Fleet to Hold Summer Exercises, More Than 60 Warships to Participate</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, 23rd] The Admiralty announced today that the British Home Fleet is scheduled to begin its summer exercises on May 31. More than 60 warships will participate in the exercises, including 3 battleships, 2 aircraft carriers, 5 cruisers, 30 destroyers, 20 submarines, and several other warships (the number of which has not been announced). Some of these warships will visit ports in Britain and Europe in the next three months. The exercise will take place on the high seas, and Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, Admiral Sir Vian, will issue orders on the flagship HMS Duke of York.</p>
<h3>Former Italian Prime Minister Gasperi Reappointed to Form New Cabinet, Plans to Unite Various Factions to Resolve Current Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] London, 24th Radio: Gasperi accepted the official order from President Nicotra today to succeed as the Prime Minister of the Italian coalition government. Gasperi is the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, and he had already begun negotiations with the leaders of other parties before officially being ordered to form a cabinet. He hopes that the strength of the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party in the new cabinet will be weaker than the cabinet that resigned on May 13. Gasperi said: "Regarding my policy direction, the country has long been aware of it, that is, to sincerely cooperate with all parties and factions to overcome the economic crisis and solve the urgent problems of the moment."</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 23rd] The eight major political parties in Italy unanimously elected Gasperi today to lead the new government. The possibility of Gasperi wanting to expel the Communist Party has been rejected by various parties, but weakening the Communist Party's power in the government seems inevitable, as the failure of Nitti and Aurenshe to form a cabinet has strengthened Gasperi's position.</p>
<h3>Italian and French Political Situations are Strikingly Similar</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York] Under the influence of President Truman's new foreign policy, Italy, following France, is also turning to the right. The Italian cabinet crisis has lasted for ten days. After the successive failures of various political leaders to form a cabinet, Gasperi is now planning to form a cabinet to expand the base and increase the number of right-wing conservatives in order to weaken the power of the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party. Gasperi's motive is to move Italy to the right in order to obtain American economic assistance, as the Truman Doctrine is to provide financial assistance to countries that are curbing communism and resisting Soviet aggression. Currently, representatives from the US Export-Import Bank are about to negotiate with Italian officials for a $100 million loan. At the same time, after the US Congress passes a $350 million foreign aid bill, Italy will also receive a portion, so the political situation in Italy today is actually the same as in France.</p>
<h3>Our Embassy in France Hosts Wei Lihuang</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] The Chinese Embassy in France hosted General Wei Lihuang at noon today. The newly appointed French Resident-General in Morocco, General Juhan, and the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jadelu, were also present. General Wei is scheduled to fly to Casa on the 27th to visit the French Air Force bombing training school and will be hosted by the Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, General Van Oley. It is expected that General Yu will visit the Chief of Staff of the French Army, General Talatel, at the end of this month before leaving France to return home.</p>
<h3>Truman Urges Congress to Extend Import and Export Controls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] President Truman today asked the meeting to approve the extension of wartime controls on certain types of food, fertilizer, and industrial equipment from June 30 for another year in order to maintain domestic production and support American foreign policy. He requested the meeting to continue to approve import controls on fats, oils, rice, and produce. The President's message also advocated that the United States continue to participate in the International Emergency Food Committee's allocation system, emphasizing that the United States must take the necessary steps to limit the import of food that other countries lack into the United States in order to avoid increasing their hunger and panic. The President pointed out that since the end of the war, American agricultural and industrial production has established new records. If other countries' production can also maintain similar heights, controls will not be necessary. However, because the progress of the world's post-war reconstruction work is slow, it is necessary to continue to retain controls on certain items. The impact on the United States itself due to controls is minimal compared to the tragic living conditions faced by most other countries in the world today. Such living conditions have a major impact on politics and society.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Proposes Restoring Trade with Japan, Plans to Purchase Millions of Dollars Worth of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] It was learned today that MacArthur's headquarters is negotiating a trade with Soviet representatives involving millions of dollars worth of Japanese goods. This is the first time since the war that the Soviet Union has entered into large-scale trade with Japan, having previously only obtained a few ____ products. It is said that part of this trade is purely purchasing, and part is barter. The Soviet economic advisor to the Allied Control Council, Lieutenant General Teleuvianki, told a United Press reporter that the Soviet proposal has been submitted to the Foreign Trade Office of MacArthur's headquarters, and it is hoped that a contract can be concluded soon. According to people at MacArthur's headquarters, the Soviet Union plans to purchase fishing boats, locomotives, and railway equipment, and is willing to supply bituminous coal, coking coal, steel products, and ferrosilicon in exchange.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Amnesty: Related to Pacifying the Civil War</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Political figures here say that the United Nations Balkan Fact-Finding Committee's blaming Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania for guerrilla activities in northern Greece can be seen as clear evidence of a new U.S. policy toward the Mediterranean. Conversely, regarding the U.S. attitude toward the Greek government, such as the White House and State Department's reiterated stance and statements during yesterday's final discussions on the Greek aid bill, the U.S. hopes Greece will expand its government and grant amnesty. Although the U.S. does not intend to exert pressure to achieve this, it has puzzled some non-partisan Greek figures here. According to these Greek figures, Greece's future depends on a swift resolution of the amnesty issue, as it has a twofold effect. Namely, (1) if amnesty can be sincerely implemented, expanding the Greek government will be easier to achieve, whether it should be guaranteed by a United Nations observer group will not be a problem, and the need for U.S. munitions will not be as urgent as it is now, and the national economy will benefit from it. (2) If amnesty is not granted, the war against the guerrillas will have no end, wasting money that could be used for other purposes. Speaking of amnesty, without sufficient guarantees, the civil unrest cannot be quelled. Therefore, it is hoped that the United States will first resolve the important issue of amnesty.</p>
<h3>International Bank Loan: Approved by the French Parliament</h3>
<p>Entirely for Reconstruction Purposes</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The National Assembly today unanimously passed the bill for a $250 million loan from the International Bank. Previously, Communist Party leader Duclos had accused the International Bank of attempting to impose political conditions on France when granting the loan, as the clause that each payment must be approved by the lender could be used to suppress French politics and government. Duclos vehemently declared that France's internal affairs would not tolerate foreign advisors, which was met with cheers throughout the room. Finance Minister Schuman told Duclos that France's dignity and independence would not be affected by this loan. France can use this loan to freely purchase goods from any country, and the interest rate is the same as other loans on the international market. $165 million of the loan will be used to purchase raw materials needed to build France's production capacity, and the rest will be used to purchase machinery. In any case, this loan will not be used to offset the national budget deficit.</p>
<h3>British to Transfer Management of Ruhr Coal Mines to German Authorities</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Authoritative sources say that the plan for the British authorities to transfer the management of the Ruhr coal mines to German authorities is nearing completion, and the transfer will be implemented soon. This transfer was originally scheduled to take place on May 1st but was later announced to be postponed. Lord Pakenham, the British Cabinet Minister for the German Occupation Zone, arrived in Essen, the headquarters of the Northern German Coal Control, over the weekend, and may discuss this matter. London insists that this transfer does not involve the transfer of ownership, but only the transfer of administrative management. In other words, the British officials in the Production Department of the Northern German Coal Control Bureau will gradually decrease.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Letter to Korean Political Leaders: Asking Them to Remain Calm and Patient</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Regarding the joint letter from more than thirty Korean political leaders to U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall, requesting the cancellation of the demarcation line between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones in Korea, and requesting that U.S. Army Commander Hodge remain in office until the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea, Secretary of State Marshall has replied to the Korean political leaders, asking them to remain patient and calm during the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Gyeongseong.</p>
<h3>Announcement of U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission Communiqué Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinshan, 24th Broadcast: The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission for Korea was originally scheduled to issue a joint communiqué on Saturday, but because the representatives of both sides still need to consider the wording of the report, it has been postponed to Monday. According to the content of the communiqué, there is not much more information than what was informally released by the leader of the U.S. delegation, Blanc.]</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 24th] Father Flanagan, founder of Boys Town in Nebraska, USA, has been invited by U.S. Army Commander Hodge in Korea and is expected to depart from Japan at the end of the month to come here.</p>
<h3>Measuring Love: Invented an Instrument</h3>

<h3>Corfu Strait Mine Incident: Britain Appeals to International Court</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Lake Success, 23rd] According to an announcement by United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie: Britain has today filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice against Albania for laying mines in the Corfu Strait. The Registrar of the International Court of Justice has sent a copy of the British indictment to me. The United Nations Security Council previously discussed the Strait issue, but due to the Soviet representative Gromyko's use of the veto, an agreement could not be reached, so it was recommended that both Britain and Albania submit the case to the International Court of Justice.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Turkish Representatives Begin Talks: Discussing Practical Ways to Aid Turkey</h3>

<p>Thanking the United States for Assistance</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Ankara, 23rd] Turkish President İsmet İnönü gave a radio address this morning, saying: The U.S. aid plan for Greece and Turkey symbolizes the friendship of the United States toward Turkey, and also acknowledges the merits of the Turkish people during World War II. The difficulties encountered by Turkey due to the impact of the war can now be alleviated with the help of the United States. In short, this action by the United States is to fulfill its task of maintaining and strengthening world peace.</p>
<h3>Balkan Investigation Committee Report: To Be Reviewed by the Security Council / Investigation Committee Work Concluded</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] Today it was learned that after the Balkan Investigation Group completes its report in Geneva, the Security Council will begin debates around June 9. The Soviet Union may use its veto power on the section condemning the three Soviet satellite states for causing the disputes on Greece's northern border.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 23rd] The eleven members of the United Nations Balkan Committee today signed the report on the results of the investigation submitted to the Security Council, and the work of the committee is now concluded. At the last meeting, the Soviet representative raised objections to some of the conclusions reached by the committee, but he still expressed his acceptance of the report. The chairman of the committee delivered a closing speech, expressing the hope that the committee will help establish lasting peace in the Balkans.</p>
<h3>Greek Foreign Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 24th Broadcast: Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris recently declared that the United Nations Balkan Investigation Group has reached an agreement on Greece in Geneva. This agreement is a necessary condition for consolidating peace and a sign of promoting international understanding. Greece is extremely willing to make peace with its neighbors and hopes that the Security Council will pass a fair resolution based on the investigation group's report and recommendations to promote world peace.</p>
<h3>French Government Prevents Labor Strikes: Prepares to Take Over Gas and Electricity Plants / Will Deploy Troops to Maintain Order If Necessary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Less than half an hour after the French Gas and Electricity Workers' Union threatened to implement a work slowdown and follow it with a general strike, the Ramadier cabinet decided at midnight to take over the nation's gas and electricity plants and their employees. If necessary, troops will be deployed to maintain supply. The union's "Communique" declared that the nation's gas and electricity workers will soon implement a work slowdown, reducing the supply by 15 to 25 percent, and a full-scale strike will be implemented on Wednesday, supplying only a very small amount of necessary gas and electricity. The strike period will depend on the situation in other industries. The Minister of the Interior announced to the press after the cabinet meeting that the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were also present at the meeting. Union leaders stated that their actions would not change due to the cabinet's resolution. The union has issued orders to branches nationwide, with the launch date to be in 48 hours. This action by the gas and electricity union is the first major conflict over wages since the government announced its policy of maintaining its price and wage policy. The union is demanding a 15 percent wage increase, while the government says there is no room for consideration before December.

Some black market trading locations are close to U.S. military supply routes.</p>
<h3>Indonesian-Dutch Negotiations Difficult to Be Optimistic: Sjahrir Publishes the Course of Repeated Talks / Rumors that the Dutch Advocate Stopping Negotiations with Indonesia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 23rd] Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir said today that Dutch Prime Minister Beel and Overseas Minister Jonkman have taken a proposal for further political concessions from the Indonesian side back to the Netherlands for governance, so that an agreement can be reached. Indonesia is asking the Netherlands to reduce its troops stationed in the East Indies so that it will no longer be regarded as a force with real offensive power. Well-informed Dutch sources say that after Beel returns to The Hague, his policy of continuing negotiations with Indonesia will encounter major opposition. It is heard that the Dutch side is launching a bipartisan movement advocating stopping negotiations with Indonesia and making Indonesia choose one of "take it or leave it," and will not hesitate to use force as a backing if necessary. Sjahrir also said that he had met with Beel twice and with Jonkman three times, frankly informing them of Indonesia's attitude, and both sides are now very clear about the truth. The fundamental difficulty is that the Netherlands does not want Indonesia to have the freedom to handle its finances independently. We insist on managing import and export trade and foreign exchange ourselves, but the Netherlands itself also urgently needs foreign financial assistance and loans. In order to gain the trust of lenders, it has to insist on jointly managing Indonesia's exports and foreign exchange under Dutch leadership, in order to manipulate Indonesian finances.</p>
<h3>After the United States Decides to Provide Economic Aid to Greece: Prospects for Greek Reconstruction</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by Our Newspaper Editorial Department</p>
<p>The United States is giving economic aid to Greece, and at the same time, it must consider the issue of building Greece and revitalizing Greece. President Truman's purpose in requesting a $250 million loan to Greece is to help the country restore its status as an independent and free country. Behind this loan, there is also a need for the meticulous planning and guidance of the United States as a price for seeking peace in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>There have been various questions raised about how to use this loan. The U.S. plan is still being drafted, but based on investigations, a preliminary forecast is made as follows.</p>
<p>Thinking on the Bright Side</p>
<p>With the assistance of the United States to establish the Greek economy, unify Greek politics, and improve the Greek army, Greece may be able to stand on its own feet and return to self-sufficiency in a few years.</p>
<p>In 1947, Greece may not need the entire $250 million loan. In this year, Greece will spend approximately $350 million, including $200 million for grains, coal, machinery, fabrics and other supplies, $50 million for construction costs, and $100 million for military equipment. The total revenue for the same year is approximately $130 million, including approximately $85 million in export earnings, $9 million in transportation earnings, and $36 million in private remittances from the United States.</p>
<p>The shortfall is $220 million, which will be offset by the following: $15 million still existing in the Export-Import Bank, $12 million in UNRRA relief supplies, and $50 million in Greece's share of U.S. relief funds for liberated countries. The remaining deficit of $143 million will be offset by new loans.</p>
<p>In 1948, Greek production and foreign earnings are expected to increase, reducing the deficit to $180 million, assuming construction and development costs of $100 million. Most of this can be offset by the remaining funds from 1947, but at least $80 million in new loans can be obtained from the United States.</p>
<p>For the next ten years, Greece will need approximately $70 million in construction costs each year. By 1958, the United States may invest $1 billion in Greece. However, unless the United States handles it properly, Greece can cooperate with the United States, and the world remains at peace, the above predictions will not be realized.</p>
<p>Thinking on the Dark Side</p>
<p>The loan that the United States gives to Greece may be used for the Greeks to kill each other, for the exploitation of the Greek bureaucracy, or for matters unrelated to the revitalization of Greece. In the event of this situation, the United States may be unwilling to waste useful money and allow Greece to fall into chaos, allowing the Greek Communists to send Greece into the arms of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>To avoid this situation, the Greek and U.S. authorities must handle it well.</p>
<p>Outline of the Aid Greece Plan</p>
<p>The plan to aid Greece is still being drafted, but based on the research done in Greece by organizations such as UNRRA, the United Nations, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, a rough outline of the plan can be obtained as follows:</p>
<p>There are three key points to the plan: first, national security, reorganizing the Greek army under U.S. guidance so that it can assume the task of defending the country; second, political stability, persuading Greek parties to cooperate to stabilize the political situation; and third, rebuilding public confidence.</p>
<p>The main goal of the plan is to restore Greece's productivity and enable it to be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>The problem of prices in Greece not only hinders domestic trade but also threatens foreign trade. If you want to develop trade, you must first suppress prices. In Greece, the prices of manufactured goods are high, and the prices of agricultural products are low. If you want to adjust this, you must abolish the tax on daily necessities, and at the same time increase the allocation of manufactured goods to agricultural cooperatives.</p>
<p>The price of Greek exports is much higher than the price on the world market. In order to encourage the export industry, a portion of the profits can be paid to Greek exporters in foreign exchange. After credit is restored, a foreign exchange fund can be placed to stabilize the Greek monetary system. But to reform the monetary system, it is necessary to cut government spending.</p>
<p>Secondly, Greece's transportation industry must find ways to recover. It will cost about $70 million to fully restore the Greek railway. Only 59 percent of the pre-war tracks are available. Since 1939, Greece has lost 82 percent of its freight cars and 76 percent of its locomotives. Greece's highways are extremely poor, and the speed of trucks is only 11 miles per hour. There are 10,000 trucks in the country, which are currently sufficient for use, but most of them are old and will not last long.</p>
<p>Nowhere in Greece is more than 70 miles from the sea, so the development of coastal shipping will be of great help to Greece. However, transportation tools suffered great losses during the war, and the total cost of reconstruction is approximately $53 million. Ships sunk in the Corinth Canal will be salvaged and sold to Greek factories as waste materials. Greece's maritime industry will soon return to its pre-war state. Greece currently has 99 Liberty ships and 2 C-1 ships, all purchased from the United States on credit. Therefore, the current total of Greece's merchant ships is approximately 1.7 million tons, all of which are relatively new ships.</p>
<p>Tobacco is a valuable asset of Greece and once accounted for more than half of Greece's total exports. If the price is comparable to Turkish tobacco, then the United States is prepared to buy more tobacco from Greece. Although the production of American cigarettes has doubled compared to 1938, the proportion of oriental tobacco used has decreased from 11 percent to 5.7 percent. If the proportion of oriental tobacco increases to 8.5 percent, Greece will sell 14,000 tons of tobacco to the United States, and the remaining 32,000 tons will be sold to European countries.</p>
<p>Other products prepared for sale to Europe include wine, raisins, figs, tanning solutions, and rosin.</p>
<p>Stopgap and Fundamental Solutions</p>
<p>The United States is currently seeking expert advice as a reference for drafting a Greek revitalization plan, while also obtaining the cooperation of the Greeks. Britain and other allied countries will assist in the revitalization of Greece by developing trade.</p>
<p>Short-term aid to Greece, the purpose is only to strengthen the Greek army and stabilize the Greek currency loans, is only a stopgap measure. Once it is used up, nothing will be left.</p>
<p>To restore Greece's former prosperity, there must be a long-term fundamental plan. President Truman said: The United States is prepared to help Greece resist aggression and make it a "self-reliant and self-respecting democracy." Greece, the Soviet Union, and countries around the world will wait and see. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)</p>

<h3>The Third Session of the City Council Will Open Tomorrow Morning / Proposals Suggest Recruiting Soldiers from Conscripts / The Finance Committee Decides Four Principles for Organizing Old Debts / The Government Should Do Its Utmost to Maintain Creditworthiness</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The first third session of the City Council will begin at 9:00 AM tomorrow. As of yesterday, a total of 154 councilors have reported to the council, and 91 proposals have been received. Of these, 66 have been reviewed, and the rest will continue to be reviewed on the 29th and 30th, respectively. The city government's policy report was delivered to the council yesterday, but the mayor's motion has not yet been delivered. In addition, the City Council Secretariat has been extremely busy working these days. Although today is Sunday, it is still operating as usual.</p>
<p>The Finance Committee of the City Council had previously submitted a motion to the second session of the council regarding the "Proposal by Councilors Tang Shichang and others to suggest that the central and municipal governments organize various old debts and determine reasonable repayment methods." A plan was drafted and submitted for discussion at this session. It is learned that the councilors strongly oppose the principle of one-to-one repayment, because the current cost of living index has reached more than 18,000 times, and the price index has exceeded 30,000 times. Even based on the minimum salary multiplication of public and educational personnel, it is 1,800 times. Therefore, the Finance Committee decided on four organizational principles to provide for this session: (1) One-to-one repayment is indeed too low, and the people's losses are too great. (2) It is suggested that the government simultaneously resolve the repayment methods for bank deposits and public bonds. (3) The government should do its utmost to maintain creditworthiness. (4) Use new debt to exchange for old debt to avoid inflation, but the nature and year of public bond issuance must be considered to determine a reasonable repayment method.</p>
<p>[Also News] Among the proposals collected by the City Council from various councilors, Councilor Tang Shichang and others proposed the following regarding conscription in the city: "In this time of fluctuating public sentiment and social unrest, the city should temporarily postpone conscription to avoid stimulation, reduce misunderstandings, and eliminate unnecessary disturbances. Currently, engaging in production is no less important than serving in the military, so it is requested that the city government forward this to the central government, recruiting unemployed veterans and others for service."</p>
<h3>Speaker Pan Visits the Eighth District - Nanshi Hopes to Establish a Temporary Epidemic Hospital</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the eighth day of City Councilor Pan's visit to the various districts. Despite the rain, he, along with Secretary-General Xiang and representatives from the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Public Health, visited the four districts of Songshan, Luwan, Yimiao, and Penglai. Councilors and the chief and deputy district heads gathered to welcome them and raised issues concerning the reform of municipal administration, requesting the speaker to make suggestions on their behalf. These included: (1) Most Bao (neighborhood) offices do not have fixed premises. It is hoped that joint Bao offices can be organized, which would make it easier to solve the issues of housing and personnel. (2) The district people's representative council has too little funding and no full-time staff, making it impossible to carry out its work. (3) There are too many leaking manure carts, causing the area around Rue Pere Robert to be filled with foul odors whenever manure carts gather. It is hoped that this can be improved. (4) Ri Hui Port is a pier for both manure carts and firewood, and every morning it is extremely crowded and disorderly. It is hoped that the manure cart pier can be moved to Qu Zhenren Road, which would not only reduce congestion but also significantly improve the hygiene of the densely populated Ri Hui Port area. (5) The French Water and Electricity Company is again increasing security deposits, which causes significant losses to residents. It is hoped that this can be stopped. (6) The accumulated garbage in the Nanshi area, including broken bricks and tiles, totals 300,000 to 400,000 shi (a unit of dry measure). The district office has been ordered to clear it, but they feel powerless. The Civil Affairs Department's allocated cleanup fee of 1,500 yuan per shi, based on the fixed survey figures, is far from the actual cost. Regarding the Luwan district, where the amount is relatively small, when the district head raised this issue, Councilors Chen Linsheng and Ma Shaoquan each donated one million yuan on the spot, urging the district office to clear it as soon as possible and not to procrastinate, in order to emphasize public health for the citizens. (7) Nanshi has a dense population and many refugees. Summer is approaching soon. It is hoped that there can be a temporary epidemic hospital. (8) The Nanshi Eastern District Fire Brigade has been restored, and the organizers Huang Bingquan and Mao Zijian are enthusiastic and dedicated, serving as good role models. Recent fires have been frequent, and various districts and Baos have been requesting the establishment of volunteer fire brigades. It is hoped that the authorities can provide as much assistance as possible on this issue.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan will visit the four districts of Huangpu, Lao Zha, Jing'an, and Xincheng today.</p>

<h3>Urban Planning Committee - Joint Meeting of All Groups</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Urban Planning Committee held its third joint meeting of all groups at 9:00 AM yesterday in the conference room of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works.

<h3>Small Loan Lending - All Repaid by Due Date</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Winter Relief Committee previously allocated 100 million yuan to launch small-scale production loans. From April 20th to May 10th, a total of 62 million yuan was lent out. According to regulations, the monthly interest rate on these loans is 2%, and it was estimated that one-quarter of the principal could be repaid by May 10th. However, the reality was unexpected, and by the deadline, all of the loans had been repaid. The Social Affairs Bureau believes this is a very good sign. At the current session of the City Council, a councilor has proposed expanding the small-scale loans to 300 million yuan to alleviate the suffering of ordinary people under the pressure of high-interest loans.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Municipal Association - Board Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Public Works Department Works Through the Night - Battling Waterlogging Everywhere</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city has been experiencing torrential rain from last night to this morning. By 9:00 AM, the rainfall had reached 5.47 centimeters. The Ditch and Drainage Engineering Department of the Bureau of Public Works has been working through the night since midnight the day before yesterday. By yesterday afternoon, although there was waterlogging in areas such as Ri Sheng Lou and Yuyuan Road Difeng Road, it receded completely after the bureau actively dredged the area. The waterlogging at Thirteen-Story Building and east of Daxilu yesterday afternoon has also receded slightly. If the weather turns clear, it can be drained completely immediately. As for the section of Jiaozhou Road and Yejiatai Road, due to the installation of drainage pipes and pumping station projects under construction, the water problems north of Xinzha Road can be greatly reduced once the project is completed. The relocation of drainage pipes near Anle Factory along Haifang Road has caused a slight blockage. The low-lying areas of the northern section of Fanhuangdu Road and Jiangsu Road, where the pipe-laying project was completed a month ago, have not experienced any waterlogging yesterday or today.</p>
<h3>Important Meeting of the Garrison Headquarters - Three Newspapers to Cease Publication Starting Today</h3>

<h3>Rice Rationing for the Poor to be Implemented Within a Month - Purchase Certificates Already Being Printed - To be Distributed by District Offices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Rice rationing for factories and schools is currently being reviewed by the Social Affairs Bureau. As of yesterday, a portion has been completed, and distribution can begin next week. The payment location has been arranged with the City Bank. After the applications from various factories and schools have been reviewed and approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, each unit will be given a notice of approval for rice rationing, which will be used to pay at the designated bank in exchange for a rice collection certificate. The certificate can then be used to collect rice from the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. The procedure is extremely simple.</p>
<p>Standard Regulations - Preventing Fraud</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday: "We will do our best to implement rice rationing for the poor within this month." The criteria for the poor, previously defined as the elderly, weak, widowed, orphaned, disabled, and those with no one to support them, as well as those with a monthly income of 300,000 yuan and family burdens, will be investigated by the district offices and police stations. The rice purchase certificates are currently being printed. After printing, they will be distributed to the poor by the district offices. The purchase certificates will need to have the name filled in. In the future, when purchasing rice, a national identity card must be shown for verification. Only if it matches the rice purchase certificate will the rice be sold to prevent fraud. The price of white rice for the poor is 168,000 yuan per shi, and the price of indica rice is 147,000 yuan. The Ministry of Food recently sent a telegram increasing the price of rice for factory purchases to 240,000 yuan per shi. The Social Affairs Bureau has submitted a request to the city government to negotiate with the Ministry of Food to maintain the original price.</p>
<p>Investigation Procedures - Many Difficulties</p>
<p>Regarding the rice rationing method for poor households, the Social Affairs Bureau previously suggested that it be organized by the government, with public sales offices or price-stabilized grain stations established in each district. However, the procedures for investigating poor households are quite difficult. Therefore, City Government Advisor Ge Kexin suggested that the rice rationing for poor households be handled by autonomous organizations and charitable groups, as they are closer to the poor and have experience. However, this also has its own shortcomings. Therefore, a meeting was convened by the city government at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of rice rationing for poor households. No decision has been made on which method to adopt, and it will be left to Director Wu and Mayor Wu to approve.</p>
<h3>Establishing Workers' Transportation Cars</h3>
<p>Approved by the General Labor Union Council</p>

Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the union, presided over the meeting and reported on the recent petition to Beijing regarding the cost of living index and Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs' hope that the city's workers should have a spirit of patience. The council then discussed proposals from various unions and resolved to approve the proposal from Liuhe Company to establish workers' transportation cars. Detailed measures will be formulated by the union's welfare department in conjunction with the company in the near future and then implemented.</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Assessment Subcommittee - Discussing Detailed Rules for Unfreezing the Index</h3>
<p>Since the government passed the implementation of unfreezing the cost of living index for workers and promulgated the Shanghai Temporary Measures for Wage Adjustment, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has announced that it will unfreeze the index starting in May. Regarding the detailed rules for implementation, such as piecework, overtime, work stoppage, leave, and vacation, a subcommittee will be formed by the Labor-Management Assessment Committee to study them. The subcommittee met yesterday morning and formulated concrete measures for issues such as piecework after the cost of living index is unfrozen. They will be submitted to the standing committee meeting of the Assessment Committee next Wednesday for approval and then announced. Reporters from Dagong News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that the measures formulated by the subcommittee yesterday are roughly as follows: (1) "Piecework" wages will be calculated according to the cost of living index. The actual base salary received each month should be calculated and issued in accordance with the discount stipulated in item 4 of the adjustment measures. (2) In principle, "overtime" temporary overtime work, extra work, the overtime wage portion will not be discounted. (3) "Work stoppage" and "leave" will be calculated based on the worker's actual monthly base salary and issued with the prescribed discount. (4) "Vacation," such as national holidays and rest days stipulated by the Factory Law, if the employer obtains the worker's consent to work overtime, the overtime portion will be paid in full without discount. However, the above measures are subject to submission to the Standing Committee of the Assessment Committee for discussion and formal decision.</p>
<h3>Liji Company Vandalized - 37 People Arrested and Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Liji Industrial Company on Hong Kong Road, which owns the "Ligong" ship, previously allowed the Seamen's Union to place some unemployed seamen.

<h3>Dapulu Fire Case - Two Defendants Sentenced to One and a Half Years Each</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The fire case on Dapulu on April 10 was heard by Judge Ye Guiling in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday. The case involved a driver named Li Ada, who was driving truck number 36561, which was carrying nine barrels of film. When the truck passed the front of number 57 Dapulu, the worker on the truck, Lin Ruifu, carelessly threw a cigarette butt into one of the iron barrels that had a crack, causing it to ignite the celluloid film.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Desheng, the suspect in the instigation of the assassination of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Times Newspaper, was also reported to the National Defense Department by Chai Yonglie, a hardware merchant, and Ruan Teng, a firewood merchant, who claimed that Zheng had impersonated a major general advisor of the Military Affairs Commission during the early days of victory and unauthorizedly received a large batch of enemy property stored in the Anli Warehouse on North Zhejiang Road, Tiantong Road, and the Takei Foreign Firm Warehouse on West Nanjing Road, Chengdu Road, including more than one hundred tons of electrical materials, copper wire, and steel.

<h3>Selling Black Market Tickets - Impersonating Air Force</h3>
<p>Guo Yinan, 20 years old, from Fujian, was formerly a driver for the Supply General Office of the Air Force General Headquarters and was later dismissed for reasons. Unexpectedly, Guo had the far-fetched idea to illegally engrave the official seal of the Air Force Headquarters and still wear his uniform and swagger around outside. Recently, taking advantage of the convenience of his "military status," he sold black market tickets at the station. At around 8:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, Guo was selling black market tickets at the first-class ticket booth and was spotted by plainclothes officers from the Third Section of the Xihu Police Section of the Railway Bureau Police Department. He was immediately arrested and taken to the section, and three second-class tickets to Nanjing and a forged "Dachang Air Force Station Official Seal" were found on his person. Section Chief Liu Yao and Deputy Section Chief Zhang Hanying reported the facts to Director Wang Zhaohu, stating that the criminal not only impersonated a soldier to sell black market tickets, but also forged an official seal, harming the reputation of the military. It has been decided to transfer him to the Garrison Headquarters for severe punishment within days.</p>
<h3>Military Vehicles Transporting Commercial Goods - Intercepted at Tushanwan, Seven Arrested for Military Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On the 12th of this month, the Seventh Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters intercepted six military vehicles of the 14th Transportation Battalion, 2nd Company, at Tushanwan, carrying gauze from the Hezhong Company and stationery such as DDT from the Huixin Company, intending to drive to Hangzhou. The six military vehicle drivers and Huang Borong, the manager of the Hezhong Company, and employees Lu Lisheng, Cha Lizhi, and He Yousong of the Huixin Company were taken to the Garrison Headquarters along with the gauze and other goods. The case is now being tried by the Military Law Office. The intercepted 36 pieces of cotton yarn and 156 pieces of cotton cloth were sent to the Textile Control Commission yesterday for review. Huang Borong, the manager of the Hezhong Company, was detained along with the six drivers for colluding with military vehicles to transport goods for profit, while employee Lu Lisheng was released. Huixin Company's six pieces of miscellaneous goods were entrusted to Hezhong Company for transportation and were unaware of the collusion with military vehicles. The goods have been returned, and employees Cha Lizhi and He Yousong have also been released. Chen Jiansheng, a military technician, is still at large and is being wanted by the headquarters.</p>

<h3>Heavy Fog at Sea - Many Ships Obstructed</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recent continuous rain and heavy fog at sea have greatly affected ship navigation. Yesterday's import and export reports from the Jianghai Customs stated that only a few ships, such as Haixin, Xiangxing, Haijing, and Daxin, entered in the morning. In the afternoon, only the Jiangjing ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route entered. The Qiujin ship on the Shanghai-Tianjin route and the Haixuan ship on the Fuzhou route had not entered by the evening. The Haimente of the Tianxiang Foreign Firm, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Europe yesterday, was postponed to today due to slow loading caused by rain. The World Class mail ship of the American President Lines, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, was also postponed to tomorrow morning due to weather conditions. By 5:00 PM yesterday, none of the small Shanghai, Yangzhou, Tongzhou, Chongming, and Qidong ships had returned.</p>
<h3>Sunny Skies Expected in the Yangtze River Basin Today</h3>
<p>The weather has changed drastically in recent days, and the temperature has dropped. Zheng Zizheng, director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, explained the reasons last night, stating that after the 20th, the warm air mass in southwestern China developed greatly. As a result, a low-pressure system formed near Hunan and Jiangxi on the following day. By the evening, the entire Yangtze River basin, including the upper and lower reaches, was shrouded in overcast skies and rain. Its center gradually moved to the southeast of Hankou. From 8:00 AM the day before yesterday until yesterday morning, intermittent showers were observed. The reason was that cold air in Central China was pushing southeast, which caused the wind in the city to suddenly increase and the rain to intensify. As of now, the high-pressure system in Central China may push to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River tonight. Sunny weather is expected in the Yangtze River area today, and the heavy rain area may shift to the southeastern coastal areas, such as Guangzhou, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou. Regarding the recent rainfall, Zheng estimated that it totaled 41.7 millimeters, equal to 1.64 inches. As for the temperature, the highest on the 22nd was 74.2 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest yesterday was 55.2 degrees, a difference of 19 degrees. The observatory's weather forecast is as follows:</p>
<p>Yellow Sea: Cloudy, sunny, localized morning fog, moderate northerly wind, medium waves.</p>
<p>Central China: Overcast, localized rain or morning fog, moderate northerly to easterly wind.</p>
<p>Shanghai: Overcast, showers turning cloudy, fog in the morning and evening, gentle to northerly wind.</p>
<p>East China Sea: Overcast, rain along the coast, gentle northeasterly to southeasterly wind, large waves.</p>
<p>Temperature on the 24th: Highest 60.9 degrees, lowest 55.2 degrees.</p>
<h3>90 Graduates of the Water Transport Department - Assigned to the Shipping Industry for Employment</h3>

<h3>Foreign Cases Tried According to Law with Impartiality; Criticism of Prisons is an Exaggeration</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The "Millard's Review" published an article "Chinese Courts," criticizing Chinese courts and prisons. Initially, the president of the District Court issued a statement, followed by a lengthy article from the High Court's Secretariat titled "After Reading the 'Chinese Courts' Editorial by the Shanghai Millard's Review," with thousands of words, mainly stating: The "Zang Da Erzi case," the "Rogers case," the "Xi Zhi corruption case," and the "Foreign Tiger case" were all tried according to law without any partiality. Regarding the prison and detention center, it is true that heating is not provided in winter, due to the high cost of fuel in recent years. Even the court offices do not have heating. Although the facilities cannot be compared to those of wealthy countries, it is an exaggeration to say that prolonged detention leads to death. The equipment at Tilanqiao Prison is rarely seen even in Europe and America. Foreign detainees receive extra attention regarding their diet and living conditions due to their different habits. Regarding the claim of using tips to secure better prison cells, it was said that it is "occasionally heard of," and sincere and strict investigations have been conducted, with repeated announcements urging litigants and lawyers to cooperate with the court and not give tips to prevent corruption.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The "Millard's Review" of this city previously wrote an editorial titled "Chinese Courts" criticizing the Chinese judicial system, which attracted attention from all sides. Yesterday, the "Millard's Review" wrote another article to explain, stating that it did not despise the Chinese judicial system and expressed regret for the previous misunderstanding.</p>

<h3>Traveler at the Orient Hotel; Dispute Over a Sent Sum of Money</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Qing Ru Yi, a senior official of the National Defense Ministry's News Bureau, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 22nd and checked into room 218 of the Orient Hotel with Commissioner Liu. At the time, he had a suitcase containing 30 million yuan in public funds. He gave it to waiter Rong Desheng to take to the accounting room and deposit it with staff member Li Peiqing. Qing opened it for Li to see, indicating that it was all cash, and then sealed it with a paper strip. However, the next morning, when Qing and others went to withdraw money for shopping, they discovered that 2 million yuan was missing in legal tender. They reported this to the police station for investigation. Li Peiqing and Rong Desheng were summoned to the station. According to Li's statement: Although the suitcase was opened during the deposit, both parties did not count the money, and the seal was intact. Rong stated that he only helped carry the suitcase to the accounting room and knew nothing else. The branch bureau is currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>A Middle-Aged Woman; Plays the Pipa for Another</h3>
<p>Negotiations for Transfer Proceed as Desired</p>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Juzhen, a 43-year-old woman from Changzhou, lived in Wusong Town. Her husband, Chen Akang, divorced her five years ago due to unemployment. Subsequently, Juzhen lived with Chen Xingsheng (50 years old) at No. 9 Chenjiazhai in the town, and their relationship was good. However, a month ago, Juzhen came to Shanghai for something and met Hua Shiquan (43 years old from Wuxi, a postal worker) whom she knew before. They fell in love and she went to Hua's house at No. 13, Lane 648, Xikang Road, and did not return. On April 7th, they held an engagement ceremony somewhere and planned to hold the wedding on June 1st.

Subsequently, Hua Shiquan reported this to the Jiangning Police Branch Bureau, which sent police to investigate. They were found at Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai. At this time, they were negotiating. Chen insisted on 5 million yuan in legal tender before allowing her to leave.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Editor: We were shocked to see our school listed in a news item in your esteemed newspaper on the 24th regarding a strike. After investigation, our students' attitude is pure, their understanding clear, and classes are being held as usual. There is absolutely no strike happening. We sincerely hope you will correct this. Respectfully, Yangzheng Middle School.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Our school has always adhered to its educational position, cared for students, and never interfered in external affairs. Classes are held as usual every day, without any strikes or suspensions. We are writing to inform you of this and respectfully request that you investigate and correct the record. Respectfully, Jinguang Middle School.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Having read the news about our school in your esteemed newspaper on the 24th, there are some discrepancies from the facts, which we hereby clarify one by one. (1) Yesterday, our association held a literary evening, and in addition to various song and dance performances, we invited well-known figures from academic circles to give speeches. Your newspaper stated that we "invited a member of the Democratic League, Mr. Pingxin, to instigate a strike," which is surprising. Our association does not know whether Mr. Pingxin is a "member of the Democratic League" and cannot clarify this for him. Furthermore, the students' strike did not start yesterday, so the so-called "instigation" is unclear. (2) The cartoons produced by the support association were reviewed before being posted and did not contain the words "Who is the murderer? The government." All students in the school can testify to this and it is easy to verify. Moreover, Qin's tearing of the cartoon occurred at about 8 PM, and the security vehicle had already arrived at the school gate. It is clear that they did not "rush to the scene after hearing the news." Many students did not even know about this incident as the evening proceeded harmoniously. The claims of "interrogation and threats" and "chaos within the school" do not match the actual situation at all. Later, the police officers crossed the fence into the school and saw that it was calm as usual, so they retreated. (3) The representatives of the department student congress represent all students. The association is elected by all students and executes the resolutions of the department student congress. If students have any objections, they can notify their grade representatives or suggest them to the association. There is no need to establish another organization. Furthermore, the organization called the "Justice and Unity Alliance" has not been heard of until now, and whether it exists is still under investigation.</p>
<p>We hope you will investigate and correct the above points. National Chiao Tung University Student Association, May 24.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation; Legal Clarification</h3>
<p>Xu Yuefan asks: A married B and had sons C and D. Later, A passed away. C and D were still young. B remarried, raising C and D. Her husband was E. E had sons F and G, and E, F, and G still used A's surname. A, B, and E have now passed away, and they did not divide the inheritance before their deaths. I would like to ask: (1) What is E's legal position with respect to B, C, and D? (2) Do E's sons, F and G, have the right to inherit A's property under the law? (3) Do A's sons, C and D, have the right to inherit E's property?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers]: (1) Legally, E is B's spouse and the relative of C and D (see Article 969 of the Civil Code). (2) (3) According to the provisions of Article 1040 of the Civil Code, F and G have no right to inherit A's estate, and C and D have no right to inherit E's property.</p>
<p>(2) Refusal to Vacate</p>
<p>Wang Huimei asks: I previously allowed Tang to temporarily reside in a part of my house out of friendship, stating at the time that he could only stay for one month. Unexpectedly, after Tang moved in, he refused to move out. Now, Tang is adopting a tough attitude and not keeping his promise. I want to legally recover it for my own use. How should I proceed to be legal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] Since you did not express any intention to lease, it should be a lending nature. Even if you collect rent, its nature is only a reward for the lending of use. Since the lease relationship has not been established, you can sue for vacating. However, there should be solid proof to recover for personal use.</p>

<h3>Shanxi Authorities Hold Emergency Meeting; Discuss Urgent School Relief Issues; Invite Presidents and Students of Various Schools to Offer Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 24th] To discuss urgent school relief issues, the Shanxi authorities convened an emergency party, government, military, and group meeting yesterday, and invited the presidents and student representatives of various schools to attend and offer opinions. The presidents and student representatives raised nine urgent issues to be resolved: (1) The food allowance received by students on public funds is insufficient. It is hoped that the actual amount of food will be issued according to the standard of two dou and six sheng of millet, or that the price will be issued on time. (2) The treatment of teaching staff is insufficient to maintain the minimum standard of living, and it is hoped that this will be resolved in the short term. (3) Publicly funded students whose hometowns have fallen into enemy hands and whose support has been cut off are hoped to receive additional relief funds in addition to the 20,000 yuan of preferential grain and flower relief funds they receive. (4) The problem of public miscellaneous fees should be resolved quickly in light of soaring prices. (5) Students are malnourished and many are sick, so the medical care problem should be resolved. (6) Student food allowances should be allocated in advance. (7) Books and instruments should be replenished in various schools. (8) The treatment of normal school students should be increased. (9) The location problems of Taiyuan Middle School for Girls and Kezhong Midwifery School should be resolved.

If there is no reply in the short term, people can be sent to Beijing to petition.</p>
<h3>Strike at Various Schools in This City; Classes May Gradually Resume Within Days; Internal Conflicts Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Due to the increasing number of students in this city becoming aware of the inside story of the student movement, resuming classes and protecting the school has become a common call from various schools. The majority of students advocating for resumption of classes are actively engaged in a struggle to win back the freedom to resume classes. Although "support association" members are still trying to incite, they are opposed by the majority of students in various schools and are in a state of decline. It is expected that most of the striking schools will resume classes within days, but internal conflicts in one or two schools have not yet subsided. On the middle school side, unfortunately, mutual beatings have also occurred due to the incitement of "support association" members, which is regrettable. The situation in various schools yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Fudan</p>
<p>At Fudan University yesterday, most students still attended classes as usual, and most professors were present, except for a small number of students and a small number of professors who were absent. At 3 PM, the school held a school affairs meeting to discuss how to deal with the unfortunate incident of the previous day. It was decided that, in view of the current situation, the school should resume classes as soon as possible, and professors were asked to persuade students in various ways.</p>
<p>Shanghai Law</p>
<p>At Shanghai Law College, at 3:15 PM yesterday, a truck suddenly brought more than 30 students from outside the school, distributing leaflets, posting cartoons and slogans, and convening a student meeting. At that time, the school was in class. Most students were unwilling to participate, which made the atmosphere tense. After receiving the report, the North Sichuan Road Police Branch Bureau, led by Section Chief Wang, went to the scene. When the police army drove to the school gate, the school gate had been closed, two gunshots were fired from inside the school, and bricks were thrown from inside the school. Section Chief Wang asked Dean Feng Yi about the situation. After discussion, it was decided that the school would send someone to check whether there were any students from outside the school remaining in the school. It was found that all students from outside the school had left a few minutes before the police army arrived. The police officers left the school and returned to the bureau at 4:25.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University</p>
<p>The resumption of classes movement at Jiaotong University has been actively launched yesterday thanks to the efforts of the Justice and Unity Alliance of the school's students. The department heads were also simultaneously persuading students to return to class. Principal Wu of the school issued a notice yesterday afternoon, hoping that students would not go to other schools to hold meetings and propaganda, and refused students from other schools to come to the school to hold meetings and propaganda, and hoped that students would accept the advice and resume classes starting next Monday (the 26th). It was also learned that the school's "Department Representative Assembly" decided to go on a hunger strike for one day this Sunday (the 25th) to support the "Nanjing Incident", but the students were not consulted in advance, which was opposed by most students. After inquiring with the person in charge of the dining group, the student union announced that the hunger strike had been postponed."</p>
<p>Datung</p>
<p>According to the news of Datung University, at 8 AM yesterday, a few students tried to instigate a strike, and blocked the classrooms and cut the phone, the majority of students advocated for class expressed dissatisfaction. The "Anti-Strike Movement Committee" was organized, and the advocacy of upper legs was thoroughly implemented. The classes continued in the afternoon, and the order was as usual.</p>
<p>Great China</p>
<p>Students at Datong University sorted out their desks and chairs and tore off all unnecessary slogans yesterday in preparation for resuming classes tomorrow. However, they still firmly demanded that the eight demands for reforming school administration be implemented. The student union classmates remained at school to work. The whole school professors were visited by classmates and requested to resume classes, most of them accepted.</p>
<p>Aurora</p>
<p>At 10 AM yesterday, two trucks of students from outside the school suddenly arrived at Aurora University to post slogans, distribute leaflets, propagate strikes, and convened meetings. At that time, the students of the school were in class and expressed their refusal. The students left angrily.</p>
<p>Shanghai Medical</p>
<p>Students at Shanghai Medical College launched a school protection movement yesterday, propagating the resumption of classes, and distributed "Letter to Students" and "Letter to Parents". Most students expressed their response, and the school is expected to resume classes in one or two days.</p>
<p>Aurora</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, dozens of medical students from Aurora University went to propagate the strike. After discussion, most students expressed regret for the unfortunate events in Nanjing, but opposed the strike, so the school continued to hold classes as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Law and Politics</p>
<p>Shanghai Law and Politics College also held classes as usual yesterday. A few students launched a response to the "May 20th Massacre Support Association", but the number of signatories was very small. The student union held a meeting at 3 PM yesterday to discuss maintaining their own studies and maintaining the school's glory, and decided not to take strike action, and rejected students from outside the school to propagate at the school, or use pressure to threaten.</p>
<p>Shanghai Business</p>
<p>A part of the students of Shanghai Business College responded to the "May 20 Massacre Support Association". Yesterday, students were forced to sign a strike. As a result, only more than 100 people signed. According to the entire school, there are about 400 people. Some newspapers claimed that more than 10 students met to respond to the strike, which was a false rumor. The school was still in class as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Normal School for Young Children</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 30 students from the National Infant Normal School, the China Vocational School, and the China Institute of Technology went to the school to propagate the strike. At that time, the situation was slightly chaotic, causing the school to suspend classes invisibly.</p>
<p>Renyi</p>
<p>After the strike the day before yesterday, most of the students of Renyi Middle School launched an anti-strike yesterday and distributed leaflets. As a result, four classes were in session, and three classes were still not in session.</p>
<p>New Construction</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] At New Construction Middle School, "students who supported the strike" and "students who did not support the strike" had a mutual fight in the morning.</p>
<p>Tongde</p>
<p>The Anti-Strike Committee of Tongde Medical College issued a quick report today. The news of the student union of the school published in a certain newspaper yesterday was purely fictitious, because the school has no organization of student unions. The school held classes as usual yesterday, except for a few two or thirty students who were absent.</p>
<p>Chung Te</p>
<p>The Chung Te Midwifery School resumed full classes today.</p>
<p>Huaguang</p>

He was seen by the post police of the Songshan Road Police Branch Bureau and taken into the bureau. Later, his father, Yao Yinquan, was summoned and handed over to him for custody.</p>
<p>Nantung</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, while the Nantung Institute was in class, more than 10 students from Shanghai Medical College broke in and made noise, posted slogans everywhere, and incited strikes, occupying the school's auditorium to hold a meeting. A "Nantung Institute Nanjing Massacre Support Association" also appeared, but all the classmates achieved that the establishment of the "Support Association" was not through legal procedures, and it suddenly appeared, of course, it could not be recognized, and the behavior such as strikes was even more absurd for abandoning studies, and they rose up against it. The propaganda students from Shanghai Medical University saw that it could not take effect and left immediately.</p>

<h3>Launching a Blitzkrieg to Popularize Mass Education</h3>
<p>— Chen Heqin</p>
<p>In this day and age, you can't afford to do anything step by step!</p>
<p>Everything must be done quickly, intensified, and accelerated. Work that would normally take twice as long must be completed in one hour. This is the economy of time, the economy of manpower, and everything in accordance with the principles of economy.</p>
<p>The authorities' intention in launching this mass education campaign in this city is to enable all citizens, including adults and children, to become literate within a reasonable period. This is clearly an attempt, and we cannot deny, nor can we deny in fact, that this is a relatively arduous task. However, everyone participating in the work is already doing it, and everyone is happy to accept this "sacred and great" mission.</p>
<p>The "reasonable period" within which the work of making all citizens of this city literate is to be completed undoubtedly refers to a period that is not very long. This is because, in fact, we do not have much time, manpower, material resources, and financial resources to engage in this work. This means that we must accelerate the launch of this mass education movement under the principle of "all economy."</p>
<p>Education is a right that every citizen should have. Similarly, teaching illiterate people is a duty that every literate person should fulfill. I am confident, and I think everyone can be confident, that making illiterate people literate and teaching illiterate people to read will certainly be mutually agreeable and mutually pleasing. The question is how to do it quickly! Quickly and effectively!</p>
<p>This is a matter of method, that is, a technical matter. However, "quick" here does not mean chaotic, but rather a regulated and reasonable quickness.</p>
<p>Let's start with the teaching methods:</p>
<p>First, do not be constrained by form. In other words, the old methods do not necessarily have to be used, such as the way classes were organized in the past, or the school system, because these fixed methods can easily make learners feel bored and lose interest.</p>
<p>Second, the methods should be varied and adaptable, constantly changing to integrate learning with life, ensuring at least a 70-80% chance of success.</p>
<p>Third, make the most of the "teach as you know" method.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to recommend the "relay teaching method" or "literacy chain," which is a method of delivering education to people's doorsteps. It not only avoids the difficulties that arise in "classroom teaching," but also expands classroom teaching, allowing education to expand in a chain or relay, both universally and deeply. For example, if I teach four people, those four people can then teach others what I have taught them. By teaching in this relay, there is no worry that this mass education campaign will not be completed one day. However, there are some points that need to be noted when using this method:</p>
<p>(1) The first group of teachers must truly understand what they are teaching.</p>
<p>(2) The teachers and learners must be mutually established on the basis of affection.</p>
<p>(3) The teachers and learners should have frequent opportunities to gather together.</p>
<p>(4) A method of assessment should be established to measure the teachers and learners.</p>
<p>(5) The curriculum, time, and methods should all be determined and followed jointly by the teachers and learners.</p>
<p>Delivering education to people's doorsteps is indeed the most appropriate and effective way to promote mass education. The worry is not that illiterate people do not want to learn, but that literate people do not act. I hope that this time, the mobilization of all intellectuals in the city (including students in the upper grades of primary school and above, school staff, shop clerks, and literate friends in each household) to participate in the work will especially emphasize that we would rather sacrifice a little and deliver education to people's doorsteps, to the doorstep of every illiterate friend. We must promote the relay teaching method to every corner of the city. To complete a dense literacy network everywhere, no illiterate person can escape this campaign.</p>
<p>If we want to encourage this method, I suggest that we spend a little money to make some identifiable souvenirs, such as badges, etc., that everyone participating in the work, whether teachers or learners, can have, or use a symbol for each person taught, so that the more students one has, the more souvenirs one has.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the teaching content and class time:</p>
<p>First, of course, start with literacy education. Use the mass textbooks from the past if they are usable, and revise them if they are not suitable. It is best to compile a set of textbooks that cover about 1,000 commonly used characters. Use them while revising them. The number of subjects does not matter, but singing is essential.</p>
<p>Second, this mass education campaign must take into account the burdens of the people. At least, we cannot hinder their work. Therefore, the class time must be reduced according to the circumstances, and the length of the study period can also be shortened appropriately. For example, if classes are usually held six nights a week, we might try holding classes three nights a week, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. This way, adults and women can take turns receiving education, which is economical in terms of both time and space.</p>
<p>Third, make the most of activities with educational significance to increase interest in learning.</p>
<p>Fourth, textbooks alone are not enough. Supplementary reading materials such as thousand-character newspapers should be compiled and printed to instill knowledge of world events and daily life.</p>
<p>Regarding the organizational structure, the simpler the better. It is easier to achieve results from the bottom up. Therefore, first, we must cooperate with administrative facilities and strengthen the launch of this movement through administrative organizations. District offices and baojia organizations are the biggest and best help. Second, each promotion district should be the organization in charge of promotion and mobilization. If we rely solely on this organization, it is indeed not enough. It is best to establish organizations such as the Bao Mass Education Promotion Association in each bao, with the bao chief, bao secretary, and principals of schools in the bao serving as members, responsible for planning and implementing. The former is a design, assessment, and guidance organization, while the latter is an implementing organization.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to give those engaged in this sacred and great work some encouragement. If we cannot make any material demands, then spiritual encouragement is necessary. For example, to encourage students to participate, we might ask schools to set up as many free places as possible, or ask enthusiastic members of society to donate scholarships. To reward educators participating in this work, the authorities could stipulate a method whereby anyone participating in the work would have their salary increased by a certain percentage after a certain period of time, or organize group trips, or distribute movie tickets to major cinemas, or publicize them in major newspapers, or have the mayor, bureau director, and other officials regularly meet with outstanding individuals. These are all methods, and everything can be decided at any time.</p>
<p>Participating in this work is like participating in a battle! As a combatant, you must have 120,000 points of confidence, 120,000 points of courage, and 120,000 points of perseverance in order to grasp victory. This battle only allows for victory, not defeat! We should seize the opportunity and accelerate the launch of a blitzkrieg to popularize mass education!</p>
<h3>Various People's Organizations in Zhejiang Province Urge Students to Return to Classes and Demand that the Government Be Responsible for Maintaining Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hangzhou 24th] Various people's organizations in Zhejiang Province recently issued a letter to students of various schools, stating: The cause of this student unrest is purely that students have made petitions and suggestions for the improvement of current educational facilities. The motives are pure and the goals are clear, and public opinion is largely sympathetic. Unexpectedly, the situation has evolved and become complex and widespread, emotions have become nearly radical, actions have become extreme, and the situation has become unmanageable. Public order has disintegrated, and the hearts of the people have been shaken. The sympathy that people from all walks of life had in the past will turn into aversion today. This is probably something that most pure students did not expect, and it is also something that parents of students are uneasy about day and night. The letter also demands that the government be responsible for maintaining order and ensuring the sacred responsibility of public security. It also demands that students immediately return to classes and intensify their efforts to enrich the true knowledge of strengthening the country in order to build society and build the country.</p>

<h3>Even the Giants are Defeated: The Expedition Wheel Wins Six out of Six, Maintaining Victory at 47 to 40</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Luoyang Expeditionary Army's Expedition Wheel basketball team continued to maintain its winning record, defeating the Western Overseas Chinese powerhouse Giants last night by a score of 47 to 40. In the first half, Expedition Wheel took the lead with a score of 23 to 14. The Municipal Gymnasium did not see a decrease in excitement due to the wind and rain; the enthusiasm was still fervent, with an estimated 2,000 fans. This was the first time the Expedition team's games had seen such a grand occasion, with 1,290 tickets sold and many people attending without tickets. This shows that the Expedition team is no longer what it used to be, and its appeal is quite considerable. Before the game, there was also the first final of the Mayor's Cup junior group, where the China-France team came from behind to defeat the Green Heroes 25 to 20.</p>
<p>Demonstrating Sharpshooting</p>
<p>The Expedition Wheel team continued to demonstrate its sharpshooting last night, combined with its unique talent and even development among its forwards. Although its passing and connection have not yet reached their peak, the hard work it has put in over the years has yielded considerable results. The ferocious Giants finally bowed their heads and succumbed once again. Giant player Founique, who has been present at every Expedition Wheel game, observing from the sidelines, was still overwhelmed by the Expedition Wheel team last night. From then on, the Western Youth brotherhood all suffered defeat, and the Expedition team's heroic spirit is unparalleled. Tu Wenlong only started showing his skill in the second half, and Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqi rivaled each other. Liu Wang guarded his position responsibly. The Giants' most ferocious players were Founique, Yelong, and Taublingki. Their formation was also frequently adjusted. Although they launched a fierce counterattack in the second half, scoring two more points than the Expedition Wheel team, they were unable to salvage the situation.</p>
<p>Determined to Win</p>
<p>The Giant team members arrived at the stadium in two batches. The timer sounded the horn at 7:15. The referees were Qu Honglu and Liu Hesheng. Taublingki received a flag from Cai Zhongqi of the Expedition Wheel team. The starting lineups for both sides were: Giants - Taublingki, Qiang Dulai, Founique, Yelong, N. Sashkin; Expedition Wheel - Yu Ruizhang, Cai Zhongqi, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, Wang Binghuan. N. Sashkin scored one point from a free throw immediately after taking the court due to a foul by Yu Ruizhang. Yelong and Wang Binghuan both missed free throws. Yu made a shot from the right corner, and the crowd cheered enthusiastically. Although Founique, "The Board Door," blocked Tu Wenlong, he still managed to throw the ball into the basket. Qiang Dulai and Founique tried to support the situation, but Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqi's successes made the score 10 to 5, a difference of double within ten minutes. Cai and Founique rivaled each other, and Tu Wenlong's single-arm shot was another masterpiece. At 15 to 9, Xuan Jiemilov replaced Yelong. Because the Expedition Wheel team was determined to win, they were overly nervous and frequently committed fouls, and also often faced the sharpshooter Founique. At 17 to 14, Yelong was replaced by Qiang Dulai, and the Giants took their third timeout. Yu and Cai each made contributions, while the Giants seemed at a loss. The first half ended with the Expeditionary Army leading by nine points, 23 to 14.</p>
<p>Giants Bow Their Heads</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the battle resumed. Kaijiemilov replaced Founique. Yu Ruizhang stood out. Yelong and Taublingki added three points. At 25 to 17, Founique and Qiang Dulai alternated. Tao and Yelong chased fiercely, making the score 27 to 22, getting closer and closer. Founique groped unsuccessfully under the basket. Yu and Cai added two more balls. V. Kairos replaced Xuan Jiemilov, and he and Yelong repeatedly scored empty basket shots. Who knew that Tu Wenlong would also contribute a smooth shot? Later, because of a dispute with Founique, he was penalized and left the court, at which time the score was 44 to 30. The last four minutes were at 46 to 34. Yelong advanced and N. Sashkin "graduated." Qiang Dulai went down again. The two armies held each other even more fiercely. The four minutes passed in the blink of an eye. At 47 to 40, Expedition Wheel won its sixth battle. Zhengtai Rubber Factory presented each Expedition Wheel team member with a pair of new basketball shoes, which the team said contributed greatly to their success last night.</p>

<p>In the second Ping Pong League, the four teams of the Fourth Postal Department showed their prowess the night before last, winning 7-0 against Chunmao and 5-2 against Jingyi, creating a great achievement of six consecutive victories, dominating the department, and living up to their seeded status. In another match, the Huayuan women's team resisted the Green team. Each group fought with great intensity.

<h3>On the Expedition Wheel's Victory Over the Giants: Quick Movements, Reliable Shooting</h3>
<p>Given the Giants' lineup last night, the Expedition Wheel should have won easily. The fact that they were caught in a difficult fight was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>The main reason for the Expedition Wheel's victory was their quick movements, which targeted the Giants' weaknesses, forcing the opponent to simply follow them.</p>
<p>In terms of overall team chemistry, the Giants surpassed the Expedition Wheel, and the Giants' efforts to win the ball under the basket, relying on the steadiness of Founique and Taublingki, led to a balanced situation. At one point in the second half, the score became 28-24.</p>
<p>The Expedition Wheel's defense was tight. As soon as the ball fell into the hands of the enemy, the entire team immediately returned to the defense. This agility is unparalleled in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Tu Wenlong's sharpshooting was slightly off, but Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqi showed their skills to the fullest. The Expedition Wheel has three shooters. If one is off, the impact is not great. Based on several games, the Expedition Wheel's shooting percentage can be said to be consistently at a fairly high level, which is still a reliable condition for defeating the enemy.</p>
<p>The Expedition Wheel players all have amazing strength. The point at which they shoot the ball is, on average, farther than most teams. Although the audience may not be used to it, it is actually where they have an advantage. They do not need to deliberately break into the enemy's defense, and can shoot from outside the enemy's zone if necessary. First-time viewers may think they are "taking a chance," but their shooting percentage tells you not to doubt it. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>Allotment of Quota-Exceeding Foreign Cotton for May to July This Year is Completed - All Spinning Mills Should Expedite Ordering from Imported Cotton Merchants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Foreign Cotton Allotment Committee of the Transportation Management Committee has recently completed the allotment of quota-exceeding foreign cotton for May to July of this year based on the number of operating spindles of each spinning mill. According to an official from the committee, the points to note for this allotment of foreign cotton are three: (1) Principles for the distribution of quota-exceeding foreign cotton for the second quarter: (A) The standard is a quota of US$20 million, equivalent to 100,000 bales of foreign cotton. (B) Spinning mills with equipment of less than 3,000 spindles that do not spin 20-count cotton yarn or higher will not be allotted foreign cotton. However, the cotton yarn spun by these mills will also not be purchased. (2) Each spinning mill allotted foreign cotton is expected to quickly place orders with registered and qualified imported cotton merchants. The foreign cotton allotment certificates can be issued to each mill according to the number, in order to apply for import permits. (3) The US government currently stipulates that special subsidies will be given as an incentive for US cotton shipped before June 30 of this year. Shipments after that date will not only not receive subsidies but will also be fined, so it is hoped that ordering and shipping procedures will be carried out as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>National Bank Denies Issuance of Parallel Line Checks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Recently, it has been rumored in the market that the Central Bank will issue so-called parallel line checks or fixed-amount promissory notes, etc. According to the person in charge of the bank, the rumors are completely unfounded. However, recently, the government has been handling loans for the purchase of spring cocoons. In order to meet the needs of rural areas, the original plan was to issue promissory notes to farmers who needed to buy cloth, with which to pick up the goods. Later, in order to avoid complicated procedures, it was decided to issue cloth delivery notes directly, without using promissory notes. The misunderstanding in the market may have arisen from this.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise - The Market is Almost at a Standstill - Only Milled Indica Rice and White Rice Have Some Trading</h3>

<p>Another dispatch: The City Government yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm convened relevant parties to discuss the distribution of rice to the poor.

<h3>Hong Kong Promulgates New Export Methods</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong, 24th] The Hong Kong government, in view of the fact that most of the foreign exchange obtained by exporters is not handed over to the government for allocation, but is sold on the black market with New York bank drafts, promulgated new methods today, stipulating that exporters must sign a statement when applying for export licenses to the Americas and the Philippines, stating that the foreign exchange obtained from exports will be handed over to a certain bank stated in the application, otherwise the export license will not be issued. It is reported that the Hong Kong government will make the following recommendations to members of the Foreign Exchange Banks Association: (1) Pay in advance to the bank's branch or representative at the destination of the goods, or pay immediately after receiving the shipping document shipped from Hong Kong. (2) Pay in the currency of the country of delivery or in a Bank of England registered pound draft.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Silk Factory Opens</h3>
<p>In order to settle workers from the rear, the government previously transferred the Qinde, Jiangshang, and Jiubao three silk factories of the enemy and puppets. Under the guidance of the Industry and Commerce Counseling Office of the Social Bureau and the National Cooperative Supply and Sales Office of the China Sericulture Company, a labor-capital silk weaving institution was established, named Cooperative Silk Factory, with a capital of 100 million yuan. China Sericulture allocated a 30 million yuan initiation share, the Cooperative Supply and Sales Office allocated a 20 million yuan initiation share, and the remainder was allocated to the labor side. The founding meeting was held on March 20th, and the address was located on Quanjiaan Road, Hongkou. After repairs, it has 100 looms dedicated to weaving silk and satin for export, and the raw materials are taken from the Silk Fabric Production and Sales Joint Venture Company, which should receive 100 looms under the name of China Sericulture. It was originally planned to open the factory for manufacturing as soon as possible, but the opening was delayed until yesterday due to the time-consuming process of connecting electricity. According to the current 9-hour daily power supply, it is only enough to supply 30 looms for weaving 15 bolts of patterned silk, which is still difficult to offset with the expenditure budget.</p>

<h3>Interest Rate Survey in Various Places - Hangzhou and Tianjin are the Highest</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the interest rate survey table of major cities across the country published by the Audit Office of the Central Bank, the interest rates in the following cities are as shown: (per thousand yuan)</p>
<h3>Plentiful Taiwan Sugar Reserves Eliminate Sugar Black Market; Large Quantities of Granulated Sugar Soon to be Shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has consistently adhered to the Social Bureau's price-controlled rationing of sugar. According to a spokesperson for the company, the sugar black market in this city has now been completely eliminated. The company's current sugar rationing policy aims to increase the rationed price as much as possible, while maximizing the rationed quantity. With sugar merchants receiving ample sugar through rations, they no longer need to purchase from the black market, and black market transactions have gradually decreased.</p>
<p>Current sugar reserves exceed 600,000 bags, an absolutely plentiful amount. Agreements have already been reached with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to charter the "Haiping," "Haihu," and "Hailong" ships to transport sugar from Keelung. It is estimated that these three large ships can carry 10,000 tons of granulated sugar and 1,000 bags of crystal sugar, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to expand its business, the company will be specially launching packaged sugar next month. This packaged sugar will come in two sizes, five pounds and ten pounds, and will be retailed through major department stores, at prices still lower than market prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended steadily, with fluctuations. The Sugar Merchants' Association's open trading showed initial weakness followed by strength for Peruvian sugar, priced at 400,500 to 409,000 yuan, later reaching 412,000 yuan, a gain of 4,000 yuan. No. 20 medium white sugar remained at 370,000 yuan. Three and a half trucks of white sugar, with sellers offering 100 bags, were priced at 380,000 yuan. Recycled Qing sugar was trading at 265,000 to 263,000 yuan, a slight decrease of 5,000 yuan. Shun Tak Qing sugar, with sellers offering several dozen bags, was priced at 255,000 yuan, showing a similar decline. Scattered transactions of Diao Qing sugar were at 240,000 yuan, Xinghua white sugar at 380,000 yuan, and Xinghua red sugar at 280,000 yuan, with fewer than one hundred transactions.</p>
<h3>De-listed Sugar Merchants Allowed to Resume Rationing</h3>
<p>After over seventy sugar merchants in this city were deemed ineligible by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and had their sugar rationing rights revoked, the Sugar Merchants' Association consulted with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to conduct a re-examination in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It has been reported that this review was completed last week, and after careful review in recent days, it was determined that the internal organization of over twenty of these merchants was still acceptable. Considering their commercial difficulties, they were initially granted small-scale sugar rationing rights to observe their future performance. As for the remaining fifty-odd merchants, to avoid overlooking any deserving cases, a third investigation will be conducted starting next Monday to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Requesting Tea Leaf Purchases</h3>
<p>National Bank Requests Review from the Four Banks Joint Treasury</p>
<p>Tea merchants, facing difficulties in exporting tea leaves, have specially requested loans from the Central Bank for purchasing tea leaves, which will then be uniformly exported by the China Tea Corporation. These requests were sent to the Central Bank yesterday. According to responsible authorities at the Central Bank, they express deep sympathy for the tea merchants' difficulties and have decided to provide assistance. However, whether they can fulfill the tea merchants' hopes remains uncertain, as the matter still requires review by the Four Banks Joint Treasury.</p>
<p>It is understood that earlier this year, as the Ministry of Finance could not bear the profits and losses of purchasing tea leaves, the Central Bank consulted with the Farmers Bank of China, which agreed to increase tea leaf collateral loans. At that time, the standard predetermined loan amount was 80% of the new tea collateral price, with Qi Hong tea at 480,000 yuan, Tunlu tea at 400,000 yuan, and Pinglu tea at 320,000 yuan. Due to recent fluctuations in tea prices, the tea merchants hope to raise the purchase price, adding expenses since May to the above prices as the lowest possible purchase price, with the government responsible for the profits and losses. If this is not approved, they will seek alternative solutions.</p>
<p>In other news, concerning the Ping Shui tea that is typically favored by North and South America, the Wu Chang Tea Company inquired about the 1946 vintage yesterday. However, their prices were exceptionally harsh, insisting on around 400,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), while the sellers were reluctant to part with their goods due to cost considerations, resulting in a continued stalemate. Other teas remained unasked for, and the market remained quiet with a feeling of uncertainty. As for the various domestic teas, price changes were minimal, with a stable mentality focused on fulfilling any demand.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Tianxiang Trading Company's "Haimen Special" departed Shanghai for Europe today, carrying 6,600 boxes of tea leaves to France, 270 barrels of cottonseed oil to Spain, 70 bales of cotton yarn to Port Said, and 200 bales of cotton yarn to Harding.</p>

<h3>Huizhou: A Revolutionary City</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou, 21st via airmail; Reported by Liang Feng, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper</p>
<p>Huizhou – a revolutionary city; anyone with even a slight understanding of modern history or China's heroic history should not find it to be a foreign place. It was discovered around the Song Dynasty, because Su Shi (Dongpo), the scholar known throughout the land in the time of Emperor Shenzong of Song for his prose, calligraphy, and painting, was demoted to the city of Huizhou after disagreeing with Wang Anshi. He spent a period of time here, leading a carefree life filled with poetry and wine, creating many immortal poems that have been passed down through the ages. As such, this place gained its fame because of this individual. After the founding of the Republic, due to the beautiful mountains and rivers, it bred many revolutionary patriots. The two honored gentlemen, Liao Zhongkai and Deng Zhongyuan, were born here. In particular, during the Northern Expedition of the Whampoa Military Academy's student army in 1925, a glorious and splendid page in revolutionary history was written here, laying the foundation for the revolution. As such, this famous city, which once radiated the light of revolution, has become a scenic destination admired by future generations.</p>
<p>This time, because of the completion of the Ma'anwei, I, as a reporter, accompanied Chairman Luo Zhuoying and a group of colleagues, and in addition to viewing the great water conservancy project of the Ma'anwei, we also took a two-day tour of this revolutionary place, which can be considered a very pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Feie Ridge, a Natural Barrier</p>
<p>We departed from Guangzhou by train, taking the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for about two hours, and got off at the central station of Zhangmutou. There, a highway connects to the railway station, running from Zhangmutou to Huiyang. This highway spans the two counties of Dongguan and Huiyang, with a total length of thirteen kilometers. Public buses carry passengers back and forth, and the fares are not too expensive, costing only 8,000 yuan per person for the entire journey. The road surface is still relatively flat, and the scenery along the way is good, with fields and mountains that are green and pleasing to the eye. After driving for about an hour, we saw a majestic high mountain standing in front of us. This is the historically famous Feie Ridge, the natural barrier to the west of Huizhou city. The terrain is treacherous. Throughout history, armies attempting to take Huizhou by land had to seize this stronghold in order to control the entire city from a high vantage point. Hence, it is known as a strategically vital location. We bypassed the foot of Feie Ridge, and within a few minutes, we reached our destination. The entirety of this revolutionary city, and the panoramic view of the historically famous West Lake of Huizhou, was completely within our sight.</p>
<p>Huizhou City Faces the River and Rests Against the Mountains</p>
<p>"Huizhou" was simply the name of the prefecture government from the Song Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty. After the founding of the Republic, it was incorporated into Huiyang County, so Huizhou City is now Huiyang City. However, due to historical reasons, people still call it Huizhou City. If we look at the map, we can see that Huiyang is a coastal county in southern China, located in the lower reaches of the East River in Guangdong Province. Facing the river and resting against the mountains, its geographical features are naturally formed. It has always been an important outer stronghold of Guangzhou. During the War of Resistance, when the Japanese army invaded from the south, they first landed in Daya Bay in the county, using this as a base to advance towards Guangzhou. The local military and civilians rose up to resist the enemy, and Huizhou City was gained and lost four times. This shows the importance of this place. After the victory, the administrative commissioner's office of the Fourth Administrative Region of Guangdong Province was also established in Huizhou City, because it could guard the South China Sea and the East River to protect Guangzhou. The current commissioner's office within the city is the former site of the Guangdong Land Admiral's Office of the Qing Dynasty. On the central beam of the roof of the commissioner's large auditorium, we saw the inscription "Rebuilt in the tenth year of the Tongzhi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty by Wei Zuobang, the Gan Yong Baturu, General of the Yangjiang Prefecture and Commander of the Guangdong Land Forces." The fact that such a high-ranking military organization was not located in Guangzhou but in Huizhou shows that it did not ignore the military value of this place.</p>
<p>Visiting the Feng Lake, a Paradise on Earth</p>
<p>The most endearing aspect of our trip was the West Lake of Huizhou. It is one of the most famous scenic areas in the province. According to historical records, it was originally named Feng Lake. Because it was located west of the prefecture, people also called it West Lake. Its scenery is similar to that of West Lake in Hangzhou. However, locals say that West Lake in Hangzhou is merely an artificial beauty, while West Lake in Huizhou has a unique natural splendor. Although this statement may seem self-congratulatory, it is indeed a good place to visit. We drifted in a small boat on the lake, taking in the scenery. Among the sights were "Hundred Flower Island," "Fragrant Grass Island," "Liudan Pavilion," "Filial Son Xiang," "Xuanmiao Temple," as well as "Wild Goose Pagoda in the Evening Sun" and "Red Cotton Waterside Pavilion," all of which are indeed famous scenic spots with unique natural charm. I visited West Lake three times in two days, once even after dusk. At this time, everything was silent, and the night was cool as water. We lay on our backs in the boat, looking up at the stars and listening to the sounds of insects, which was an especially pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Dongpo's Concubine Chaoyun's Ancient Tomb</p>
<p>There is a "Su Causeway" on the lake, said to have been built by Su Dongpo. When he was demoted to Huizhou, he bought this area as a fish release pond and built a dam to hold back the water, so later generations named it "Su Causeway." In addition, there is also the "Tomb of Chaoyun," Su Dongpo's concubine, which is also a famous place. The tomb was rebuilt by Prefect Yi Bingshou during the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, and it is still not very old. The inscription on the tombstone reads "Tomb of Wang Chaoyun, concubine of Su Wenzhong Gong," and there are many inscriptions by famous historical figures in the surrounding area. There are two couplets at the tomb entrance that are worth reciting. The first is: "When coming from the South Sea, scripture scrolls and medicine furnace, a hundred-foot river tower flying willow catkins; after Dongpo left, night lamps and immortal pagoda, a pavilion of bright moon and cold plum blossoms," written by Chen Wei during the Guangxu reign. The other is by Xu Qi of the Guangxu reign: "The fragrant tomb still seems alive, a small plot of land is enough to make the mountains and rivers important; the jade ridge is clear and sleepless, sometimes the sound of jade pendants comes from the sky." After reading them, one cannot help but feel envy for the romantic and unrestrained scholar Dongpo, and extend infinite sympathy to the meager Chaoyun.</p>
<p>Five-Arch Bridge, Revolutionary Historical Site</p>
<p>At the northern end of the lake, there is a bridge called the Five-Arch Bridge, next to which stands a memorial碑 that is not very tall. This is the memorial碑 for the Whampoa Army's attack on the city. Here, there is a very heroic revolutionary historical site: In 1922, Chen Jiongming rebelled in Guangdong, using Huizhou as a base to attempt to capture Guangzhou. At that time, Sun Yat-sen sent troops to suppress the rebellion, but they were repeatedly unsuccessful. It was not until 1925 that Chiang Kai-shek (who was then a staff officer) personally commanded the student army of the Whampoa Military Academy, fighting hard for a month before finally occupying Feie Ridge. However, the defending army in the city was still strong, stubbornly resisting within the city. The city was surrounded by water, and the only connection to the city was the Five-Arch Bridge. The defending army heavily fortified this passage, causing great losses to the attacking Whampoa revolutionary army. Regiment Commander Liu Yaochen was killed in action here. Later, Chiang Kai-shek made the greatest determination, boosting the morale of the remaining troops, and under the drive of澎湃 revolutionary enthusiasm, they risked danger, bravely sacrificed themselves, and finally crossed the Five-Arch Bridge. Using people as ladders, they climbed up the city wall, and the staunch defending army was scattered at the first blow. From then on, the National Revolutionary Army laid an unshakable foundation and completed its great historical mission. Mr. Liang Jingqiu, a local revolutionary elder who had participated in the Huanghuagang Uprising, recounted the situation of the revolutionary army's attack on the city to us in a vivid and colorful way. Their great spirit of sacrifice is truly worthy of infinite admiration. Many of the high-ranking officials currently holding important military and political posts are believed to have participated in this battle. General Luo Zhuoying was one of them. However, Chairman Luo said that he was just a low-ranking artillery officer at the time.</p>
<p>Commercial Prosperity as a Distribution Center</p>
<p>In addition to enjoying the scenery of the lake, we also conducted brief visits to various aspects of this famous city. In addition to being a famous historical site and a military stronghold, it also has considerable economic value. Because it is located in the lower reaches of the East River, it is a thoroughfare for goods entering the province from Chaozhou and Shantou. Goods from the upper reaches of the East River are distributed here, and merchants gather in large numbers, making commerce prosperous. There are about twenty or thirty hotels in the city, which are almost always fully occupied by merchants from various places who come to purchase goods. The bustling atmosphere of the market here can be imagined. Moreover, the county has many harbors. If the fishing industry there can be greatly developed, it is believed that it will greatly contribute to the economic development of Guangdong Province. Local education is also quite developed. The county has ten middle schools, 386 primary schools, and more than 37,000 students. As for public security, this is a serious problem in the area. Previously, the communist army's so-called East River Column was concentrated in the Pingshan area of the county. Since the "Northern Withdrawal," the remnants, disguised as bandits, robbed and harmed the local population. Recently, the leader of the team, Zeng Sheng, secretly returned and has taken more organized actions, sabotaging government orders, obstructing grain and labor administration, disrupting the market, and harassing the villages, causing the people to suffer greatly. Although General Huang Zheng, the administrative commissioner of the Fourth Administrative Region stationed there, is an experienced old general, and many of the more organized bandits have been eliminated under his combination of suppression and pacification, the local area can generally be said to be more peaceful than before. However, sporadic bandits are still causing trouble everywhere, so the public security problem in the East River, although not very serious, cannot be said to be completely non-existent.</p>

<h3>Northeastern Communist Army Strength Still Largely Preserved, Recklessly Launches Full-Scale Offensive on the Periphery of Changchun</h3>
<p>— Changchun, 10th via airmail; Zhao Zhan, Reporter for this Newspaper</p>
<p>It has long been evident that the Communist army in the Northeast is intentionally making a high-stakes gamble. This spring, they launched four large-scale southward offenses, suffering extremely heavy losses! It is estimated that of the 200,000 soldiers, over 50,000 were lost, including some highly skilled units. Although the Communist army has suffered repeated defeats, their ambitions remain undeterred. The battles in the Liuhe area along the Jilin-Qingyuan line, directed by Hua Te from mid-March to early April, can be said to be the finale of the Communist army's tentative harassment in the spring. Small-scale incursions still occur from time to time, and it is possible that new offensives will develop soon.</p>
<p>The Communist army uses "North Manchuria," a vast and complex terrain, as its base, with its command headquarters in Harbin and its arsenals in Jiamusi. In eastern Jilin and northern Andong, east of the Jilin-Qingyuan line, the Communist army uses the Changbai Mountains as cover, engaging in disruptive harassment. It can echo Songbei to the north, connect to Dalian to the south, and directly target the waist of the Nationalist army in the west. The terrain is quite advantageous, but the troop strength is weak. From Laoye Ridge in eastern Jilin, along the Second Songhua River to Wangfu in northwestern Nong'an, the Nationalist and Communist forces face each other across the river. After the Songhua River thaws, the Communist army is unable to launch a frontal southward offensive. Therefore, the main force of the Communist army has moved to the area west of Changchun and Nong'an, west of the Changtao Road, from Damai Fuyu southward. The Communist army is concentrated in Qian'an, Changling, and Liaoyuan, numbering about seven or eight divisions. Recently, new recruits have been transported from Harbin to Fuyu, and the railway from Damao to Wangfu is being repaired, indicating that the Communist army will launch an offensive from the west towards Changchun and Siping.</p>
<p>Siping's Defense Work is Strong</p>
<p>Chen Mingren, the commander of the Fifth District Pacification Headquarters, said, "The Communist army will target Siping." He frankly stated that the defense work in Siping has been done very well. Lü Zhengcao, the military officer in charge of this operation for the Communist army, frequently harasses the area from Liaoyuan along the arc-shaped line of the Xinliao River southwest to Kailu in Jehol, relying on "East Mongolia" as a stronghold. The Nationalist army is always vulnerable to attacks from Mongolian cavalry, but the threat is not significant.</p>
<p>Dalian in the southern part of the Liaodong Peninsula is currently a crucial link. The Communist army has concentrated over 50,000 troops in Dalian, reportedly consisting of elite units. There is no doubt that the Communist army intends to use force to obstruct the Nationalist army from taking over Dalian. The importance of Dalian can be demonstrated by General Wang Yaowu's statement: "Receiving Dalian will allow the Shandong war to end six months earlier." It is said that the Chinese Communist Party considers Dalian to be the gateway to the entire "liberated zone." Judging from recent events, Dalian is bound to be taken over. After the final act of taking over the Liaodong Peninsula is completed, the focus of the war will be drawn to Songbei.</p>
<p>Analysis of the Nine Military Regions by Number</p>
<p>What is the strength of the Communist army in the Northeast? Based on the most recent accurate intelligence and numerical judgment: the Communist army in the Northeast has nine military regions, ten divisions, seven independent brigades, one column, one attached army, and one Korean Communist detachment. The strength of the nine military regions is about 70,000 people: the Jidong Military Region has 20,000 people, Jibei has 4,000 people, and Jinan has 2,000 people. The Liaoji Military Region has 11,000 people. The Liaoning Military Region has 10,000 people. The Suining Military Region has 6,000 people. The Jihei Military Region has 6,000 people. The Puppet Manchukuo Military Region has 8,000 people. The Songjiang Military Region has 2,000 people. The Jidong Military Region has the largest force. Of the four southward offenses by the Communist army in Songbei, the troops in this military region participated in three. The troops in this military region were involved in capturing Qitamu, Jiutai, and attacking Dehui. Only during the fourth offensive, the mobile warfare around Nong'an, did this military region remain inactive. It is rumored that there was friction between Zhou Baozhong and Lin Biao, and this was the reason. The ten divisions have a strength of about 60,000 people: the First Division has about 4,500 people and is stationed in Harbin. The Second Division has about 5,000 people and its location is unknown. The Third Division has about 4,500 people and is stationed in the Chalukou area. The Fourth Division has about 4,000 people and is stationed in Damai. The Fifth Division has 4,000 people and is stationed near Taolaizhao. The Sixth Division has 5,000 people and is stationed in the Wukeshu area. The Seventh Division is the largest, with three旅 under its command, totaling about 20,000 people. It is stationed in the areas of Wuchang, Shulan, and Baiqitun. The Eighth Division has about 3,000 people and is stationed in Dahuangou. The Ninth Division has about 4,000 people and its location is unknown. The Independent Second Division has about 5,500 people and is stationed in the Mengjiang area. The seven independent旅 have a strength of about 30,000 people: the 24th旅 has 3,000 people, the 25th旅 has 3,000 people, and they are stationed in the area east of Huadian. The Railway Police Second旅 has about 3,000 people and is stationed along the railway from Harbin to Shuangcheng. The Independent旅 has about 7,500 people and is stationed in eastern Jilin. The 38th旅 has about 5,000 people, the 47th旅 has 3,000 people, and their locations are not specified. The 359th旅 has about 5,000 people and is stationed in Fuyu. It is the Communist army's most elite backbone. It is said that the旅 Commander is concurrently held by Cao Lihuai. The Seventh Column, commanded by Wan Yi, has a strength of about 30,000 people and is responsible for field operations. Its mobility is very high and it is currently likely stationed in the Changling area. The attached First Army of the Democratic League and the Korean Communist detachment have a strength of about 15,000 people and their location is unknown. The total strength of the listed units is about 200,000 people. Adding the 50,000 people in Dalian and other armed work teams, the total strength of the Communist army in the Northeast is about 300,000 people. (Editor's note: According to a report from this newspaper in Shenyang on the 20th, a military official stated that the current offensive by the Communist army in the Northeast is a full-scale operation with a force of about 500,000, indicating that the Communist army has made new deployments.)</p>
<p>The Communist army in the Northeast can be said to be isolated, unable to establish close contact with the Communist army in the mainland. They are trying to open up the Inner Mongolia corridor to establish contact with the Communist army in northern Shanxi, and are desperately trying to hold Dalian as a beachhead to connect with Shandong. However, this attempt will not succeed. Dalian is indefensible, and Inner Mongolia is also unreliable.</p>

<h3>The Mourning of the Family of the Person Killed in a Car Accident</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>My husband, Zheng Yuelian, was 41 years old, a native of Ningbo, and resided at No. 6, Lao Xiu Lane, Baker Road. He worked at the Ma Le Shipyard in Pudong, leaving early and returning late, relying on this work to support the family. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, he set off as usual (he often took the No. 2 streetcar from Chengdu Road Station every morning), but he did not return home in the evening. The next afternoon, someone from the factory came to inquire, thinking he was missing, so they reported it to the Xin Cheng Police Station for investigation. Later, an plainclothes police officer from that branch came to notify us, saying that on the morning of the 2nd, someone was hit by a passing vehicle and injured on the road opposite the tram stop at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road. He was sent to Hongren Hospital by the police car for treatment, and they did not know if he was the missing person from our family. We rushed to visit him and found that it was indeed my husband. He had suffered a severe brain injury, his jaw was tightly clenched, and he could not speak. He died on the morning of the 5th. I inquired with the Xin Cheng Police Station about the circumstances of the accident, and the bureau replied that when he was found, the injured person was already lying on the ground and could not speak, and the vehicle that caused the accident had already fled. The bureau also did not know the true circumstances. Alas! What kind of vehicle hit him? I am sure there were eyewitnesses. I implore you to speak out righteously and send a detailed letter with the offending vehicle's details (especially the license plate number) and the circumstances of my husband's injury, so that we can pursue justice and prevent the wrong from sinking to the bottom of the sea. Both the living and the dead will be grateful! (Zheng Shiyun)</p>
<h3>Map of Henan Northern Refugees' Flight</h3>
<p>— Zhengzhou 20th Dispatch (Airmail) - Our Zhengzhou Correspondent Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>It is said that the 400,000 refugees inside and outside Anyang City all fled for fear of the Communist Party's "struggle." We shall leave aside whether or not they are all qualified to be "struggled" against, but in fact, under the dense artillery fire of the Communist army's siege, they are being "struggled" against.</p>
<p>Escaping from Anyang City</p>
<p>Groups of people's representatives, upon arriving in Zhengzhou, burst into tears, appealing to the military authorities to send reinforcements quickly and requesting all parties to rush grain supplies, shocking the general public in Zhengzhou. This situation is like a person jumping off the roof of a house surrounded by robbers, escaping to the street, and shouting for help, frightening passersby.</p>
<p>Immediately Rescuing Anyang Refugees</p>
<p>There is only one way: to send grain by plane. The provincial government contacted an airline, and the company proposed the following conditions: 34 million yuan for a round trip to deliver grain, and if the plane encounters an accident, compensation of US$30,000 in foreign exchange, and US$50,000 in cash. The provincial government agreed to all these conditions one by one. Indeed, if it were not for valuing life with heavy prices on the one hand and saving lives with heavy prices on the other, how would the importance of human value be demonstrated!</p>
<p>Although things were settled, not a single plane had been sent to deliver grain as of the 17th, more than ten days after Anyang was besieged.</p>
<p>200,000 Refugees Around Xinxiang</p>
<p>According to Li Hongyin, Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, at least 80,000 of them are in dire need of rescue. The Henan Northern Refugee Relief Committee was established in Xinxiang on the 10th, and at least 2,000 refugees register every day. Refugee registration is currently being conducted in 25 counties in northern Henan. If the situation in northern Henan stagnates, then the people of northern Henan will definitely have to flee like the saints of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>More than 25,000 refugees who took 15,000 yuan in relief funds from Xinxiang arrived in Zhengzhou. People in Zhengzhou who have relatives and friends from northern Henan have recently felt a difficult burden to bear. If they don't entertain these relatives and friends who come to their door, it is against human nature; if they do entertain them, prices are so high that they can't afford it. Of these more than 25,000 refugees, only more than 2,000 go to soup kitchens for food, and the rest live with relatives and friends. This is a good source of information for those who study Chinese social issues to prove where Chinese social relations are built. The tragic scene of joyful reunions, if it could be put on stage, would also be a very good tragicomedy.</p>
<p>More Than 5,000 Young Students</p>
<p>Filled out applications in Xinxiang and other places, expressing their willingness to come to the rear to study, and also crossed south to Zhengzhou. Students in the graduating classes of junior and senior high schools have started school; other non-graduating students, some went home, and some, after participating in several ball games in Zhengzhou, returned to northern Henan feeling bored. It is said that half of the students have flowed back. The Ministry of Education has now sent people to Zhengzhou to help these young people, but those who have been sent need to be "rescued" first, because they have not found a house after a few days and cannot work.</p>
<p>Prices in Zhengzhou Have Surged</p>
<p>I asked a refugee, "Is it okay to hide at home and not flee?" The refugee replied, "I didn't want to flee, but that day a company commander of the Eighth Route Army arrived in my hometown (countryside of Tangyin) and insisted that I leave. I said, 'If I go out today, I will starve to death tomorrow. Where can I go?' The company commander said, 'Even if you are really going to starve to death tomorrow, you have to go out today!' This was his good intention, telling all the people in our village to leave."</p>
<p>Now Zhengzhou Has Become</p>
<p>A Place Where Refugees Intertwine</p>
<p>Probably those coming from the east are refugees returning to the Yellow River Flood Area, and those coming from the north are refugees forced out of northern Henan by the Communist army. There are one or two thousand people each day. Their current situations are different, but the pain they can understand from each other is the same. Now there are still some Communist troops harassing the flood area, and the refugees returning to the mud area of the Yellow River Flood Area have added a shadow to their hearts that only the tearful eyes of the refugees in northern Henan can see; the hardships of the refugees in northern Henan starting their wandering can only be understood by the hearts of the refugees in the Yellow River Flood Area who have been displaced for ten years.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Has Decided on a Solution</p>
<p>Let the six counties of Yuzhong, Xiang, Jiao, Li, Yu, Ye, and Wu settle the refugees from northern Henan, and Zhengzhou is preparing to accommodate more than 10,000 people. The most problematic thing now is food. The Zhengzhou Emergency Refugee Relief Committee wants to request the United Relief Agency to allocate some flour. The United Relief Agency already has 2,200 tons of flour in Zhengzhou, which is prepared to help the Yellow River Flood Area. But at present, the Yellow River Flood Area is also unstable, and there is no way to transport and distribute the large amount of flour. If it is allowed to spoil in Zhengzhou, it is better to distribute it to the refugees in northern Henan. Now it depends on whether the United Relief Agency is prepared to save these unfortunate people.</p>

<h3>On Modern French Painting: The Feeling of Emotion and Reality</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>If we observe the forms of all things, not as a matter of visual form, but as the form sustained by the perceptual "lines," "colors," and "planes," we may also feel the material phenomena possessed by all things, but in order to express the reality of perceptual objects, the same is true in the realm of color. Therefore, if one tends to the extreme of perceptual reality, it possesses a power like a symbol or an emblem. To illustrate this with an example, the painting work of Dadaism is like this.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the work of Dadaism is anarchism in painting, but this is not a doubt born of ignorance, nor a negation born of ignorance, but an extreme extension of perception.</p>
<p>This tendency is expressed very strongly in the Cubist painting method. The so-called Cubist painting has fully transcended the so-called visual sensation, neither regarding visual pseudo-perspective nor requiring the necessity of visual perspective. It can be said that it only wants to apply the surface of matter to a picture through perception. What Cubism feels is no longer the visual sense of painting, and there is no emotion to speak of. It can only be said that it is a respect for the Connaisauce of painting, and an extreme drive of perceptual sensibility.</p>
<p>Dadaism is like this, and Cubism is also like this; most of the painters of the Paris School who grew up from such a tendency in painting emphasize perceptual sensibility. For example, even though Surrealism does not have the doubt and negativity of Dadaism, there is no problem saying that they drive the obvious perceptual sensibility to the extreme, so much so that it is like a symbol or an emblem. When Surrealist painters look at things, they pay special attention to Imagination, and even try to make it transform. Therefore, the so-called emphasis on imagination seems to be contrary to perceptual sensibility, but in fact it is not contradictory. The so-called use of imagination to transform the perception of things is nothing more than promoting perceptual reality. Therefore, we can say that the spirit of realism belonging to painting and the spirit of surrealism both belong to the perceptual realism of painting.</p>
<p>This phenomenon can be seen in all painters of the modern Paris School who paint based on Cubism. For example, Marcel Gromaire is like this, Giorgio de Chirico is also like this, and Eouconier and Fermard Leger are also like this.</p>
<p>We can examine the third type of painting attitude in response to the above two types of painting sensibility. Because the painter values the feeling of emotion and wants to express the reality felt by emotion in a "painting" way, we can call it the Realite de Sentiment.</p>
<p>It is worth saying here that since the creation of human culture, there has never been an era that respects human emotions as much as the modern era. The so-called primitive humans all painted with this emotion as the center. They could feel God as a lamb; they would also feel love for things as a goddess. Moreover, they did not feel anything new about this emotion-centered sensibility, nor did they need anything else besides it. However, with the evolution of human culture, it is almost impossible to judge or think about things solely based on emotions. Because of that long tradition, they have almost completely forgotten the point of emphasizing emotion in paintings. But in modern times, artists have once again placed great emphasis on this emotion.</p>
<p>That is because modern artists have realized that the world of art is a world of sensibility; if this sensibility is discarded, it is impossible to feel the so-called beauty of art. Therefore, painters do not trust all vision, nor do they consider it necessary to explore perception, but rely solely on their unique innate emotions as the only artistic compass. The painter's observation of nature and all things is by no means merely a mechanical reflection of vision. At the very least, it can be said that it is a reflection on the painter's heart and nature or all things felt by the painter's emotions. Therefore, even if it is not possible to truly resemble nature or all things, it will not become a painting problem. What becomes a problem is whether the painter's emotions belong to painting? The so-called "belonging to painting" means that painting is purified and tailored. The painter's emotions are in fact an innate quality, spirit, and state of mind.</p>
<p>If a painter can express the truth felt by his emotions, then that is his most unique expression and also his most personal expression. All objects can be observed and felt by the painter, but the so-called painter's emotions are the artistic conception that each painter uniquely senses. The truth felt by emotion is truly personal and unique. In the context of wanting to express the truly personal and unique, the work of emotional writing is worth studying.</p>
<p>Marc Chagall wants to transform everything felt from nature into what is felt by emotion, and then express it on the screen. If he feels the deliciousness of a fish and is fond of the contents of a cup, his thoughts will definitely fly into the air. This situation may not be able to be visually observed or perceptually conceived, but it can be clearly and freely felt emotionally. He wants to express his emotions freely and truthfully without changing the original shape. Therefore, when people see this situation, they may feel a bit imaginative and fanciful (Fantustic), but Chagall does not like people to say that his paintings are fantastic. Because he never thinks it is imagination, on the contrary, he thinks it is truth, and believes that he is a realist painter.</p>
<p>The so-called truth about painting's emotion actually contains the meaning of a painter's hymn from the heart. The painter feels the joy of life in praising his emotions. Gearge Reault regards this emotion as something religiously solemn, while Amedeo Modigliani feels this emotion in the pleasure of the senses. All of this proves that modern French painting is neither visual nor perceptual, but only a painting trend centered on emotion.</p>
<h3>Jin Songcen and "A Flower in a Sinful Sea"</h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>The author of "Reading A Flower in a Sinful Sea," Yan Gu Laoren, a learned scholar of Qinchuan, whose surname is Zhang, given name Hong, style Yin Nan, has recently been recorded as saying: "Some people suspect that Yan Gu Laoren is the pseudonym of Jin Songcen, a famous old gentleman from Wujiang who died not long ago, because the first three chapters of the first collection of 'A Flower in a Sinful Sea' were originally written by Jin, and later completed by the Sick Man of East Asia..." That's right, Yan Gu Laoren is not Jin Songcen, but Jin Songcen's contribution to the initial draft of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" was not limited to the first three chapters.</p>
<p>However, most of the current novels "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" are the revised editions of 1927, which are very different from the twenty-four editions before that twenty years ago, so even the Sick Man of East Asia, Zeng Mengpu himself, is no longer clear about how much of Jin's work still exists. Not only that, since Jin was the originator of this book, he must have had a full list of sixty chapters when he drafted the writing plan at that time, and he must have had many opinions participating in it. Looking at the preface to the revised edition written later by the Sick Man of East Asia:</p>
<p>"The motivation for the creation of this book was not me, but a lover of freedom. He is none other than my friend Jin Jun Songcen, named Tianhe. He initiated this book and had written four or five chapters. At that time, I was founding the Novel Forest Publishing House and advocating the translation and writing of novels. He sent me the manuscript to read. After reading it, I recognized it as a good subject matter. However, Jin Jun's original manuscript focused too much on the protagonist, only depicting a unique prostitute, with only a slight reflection of related current events... In my opinion, however, it was different. I wanted to use the protagonist as the thread of the whole book and accommodate the history of the past thirty years as much as possible... At that time, I told Jin Jun my opinion. Who knew that Jin Jun would go with the flow and unload the responsibility of continuing this book entirely on me. I was also honestly impolite. I dotted and altered Jin Jun's original manuscript of four or five chapters while proceeding non-stop. In three months, I completed twenty chapters in one go. In the first four chapters of these twenty chapters, there are quite a lot of Jin Jun's original manuscript mixed in. For example, the opening poem and a parallel prose are copied from the original manuscript without changing a word. The rest of the parts also have it everywhere, and even I myself cannot tell who is who. Even in the currently revised version, half of Jin Jun's original manuscript remains."</p>
<p>With this passage, it seems that it would not be impossible to print "Co-authored by a Lover of Freedom and the Sick Man of East Asia" on the book "A Flower in a Sinful Sea."</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a reason why this old gentleman from Wujiang, Jin Songcen, could be the originator of this novel "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" with quite revolutionary ideas forty years ago. We must know that at that time, he was one of the financiers who funded the printing of "The Revolutionary Army," a book written by Zou Rong, a martyr who was most effective in promoting revolution. He was also known as Jin Yi. According to "A History of Late Qing Novels," he had seen two of his collections of essays, and he also compiled and translated "Freedom Blood," a history of the Russian Nihilist Party. "Thirty-Three Years of Fallen Flowers Dream" was also translated by him in the late Qing Dynasty. Therefore, as described in "Anecdotes of the Revolution," Jin Tianbian also often engaged in revolutionary activities at that time, and after the Shanghai Patriotic Girls' School, he also returned to his hometown to run such a girls' school.</p>
<p>Also in "A History of Late Qing Novels," it is said that Jin Songcen was also a literary theorist at that time. He had guided a very important novel theory in the "New Novel" magazine, which was titled "On the Relationship between Love Novels and the New Society," thereby clarifying the value of novels for reforming society. He also mentioned his masterpiece "Women's Alarm Clock," but did not detail the author's name, while in "A History of Chinese Women's Life," it is said that it was written by "Jin Yi, a lover of freedom," thus revealing this "mystery." This is a booklet that promotes women's engagement in revolution, and its advocacy for equality between men and women is still very worthy of our admiration even today, forty-five years later. If one speaks of its enthusiasm, it can be said to be a "sister piece" of "The Revolutionary Army."</p>
<h3>Seal Carving</h3>
<p>— Qian Juntao</p>
<h3>Art Talks - After Viewing the Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition of Qian Jun and Xu Ju'an</h3>
<p>— Xu Wei</p>
<p>Art is a kind of sensory education. However, the creation of plastic arts can transcend any man-made and natural restrictions, regardless of national borders or race. It has a wide and profound distribution in terms of region and level. A woodcut by a Chinese woodcut artist can be exhibited in the Soviet Union without explanation, and reap the effect of education and resonance. The pictures on the walls of the Altamira Cave in Spain in the early days can also be seen to have its function and desire in the eyes of modern people. Where the power of this written language cannot reach, plastic arts can reach very naturally and easily. Therefore, the higher the cultural level of a country, the more developed its plastic arts must be. Taking China as an example, China has a history of five thousand years, and we can see the accumulation of this historical wisdom from China's plastic arts. That is to say, as long as we see the kind of delicate brushstrokes and far-reaching layout of Chinese paintings, as well as the vigorous charm and ingenious changes of Chinese characters, we can very clearly infer its great wisdom.</p>
<p>This time, after watching the "Calligraphy, Painting and Seal Carving Exhibition" of Mr. Xu Ju'an and Mr. Qian Juntian at the Ningbo Fellow Association, I had such a feeling.</p>
<p>I have known Mr. Qian Juntian for several years, but I only know that he is a book cover designer and a pattern painter who is devoted to Expressionism. It was not until a few days ago that I went to Mr. Qian's bookstore to chat, and accidentally noticed that he was busy preparing for the exhibition, that I saw a large amount of Mr. Qian's ink and seal carving achievements. Today, after a conversation with Mr. Qian, I learned that his study of calligraphy has been nearly twenty years, and his seal carving has also been actively processed in the past five or six years. A total of more than one hundred pieces of calligraphy and seal carving were exhibited this time. In terms of calligraphy, it has the aura of Jin Dongxin's official script and Zhao Zhishu's Wei script, which seems to be full of vigorous and heroic consciousness. In terms of seal carving, he initially learned Wu Changshuo's style, and later gradually tended to Zhao Zhishu's tendency. But it is only a "tendency." Through the inevitable simulation stage of the learning period, he has been and is constantly working hard to create himself. In particular, the self-contained seal carving is very obvious. And the "white edges" of the stone carvings are also used in modern and simple texts. For example, in the piece "Helping Leisure," its "white edges" say: "In the past, Jiang Shantang criticized Luo Liangfeng for interacting with adults and gentlemen, which was actually helping leisure. Today, although I have not interacted with adults and gentlemen, I still help leisure when responding to the requests for calligraphy and painting from people in the leisure class. It is inevitable that I will be laughed at by the likes of Shantang, so I carve this." From this, we can clearly see the artist's distress, and Mr. Qian's view on art has already been clearly stated between the lines.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Ju'an, a painter of traditional Chinese paintings who is from the same hometown as Mr. Qian and is also committed to plastic arts, exhibited a total of more than 160 pieces this time. Mr. Xu's engagement in traditional Chinese painting is entirely out of self-study. He has loved drawing since he was a child. After 1927, he went to Shanghai and began to associate with some traditional Chinese painters in Shanghai. Therefore, Mr. Xu's experience in engaging in traditional Chinese painting has been nearly forty years. And Mr. Xu only devoted himself to meticulous brushwork figure paintings in China, occasionally using landscapes as a background, but not devoted to pure landscape paintings. This focused direction has enabled Mr. Xu to achieve extraordinary achievements. Among the exhibited works, "Four Red Paintings" is the most outstanding work, and the author himself feels the same way. In addition, in "Eight Immortals Picture," the author fully expresses the different personalities of eight people on the same painting, which shows that the author's research on painting is not only superficial, but psychological; it is not only the configuration of colors, but also the expression of artistic conception.</p>
<p>Looking at Mr. Xu's paintings as a whole, we have a feeling of lightness and elegance; looking at Mr. Qian's calligraphy and seal carvings, we have a vigorous and heroic response; the former has a feminine beauty, and the latter contains a masculine strength. Comparing and reading them, each has its own merits, and it seems to be just right. This is naturally a congratulatory "harvest" of this exhibition.</p>
<p>But here, I should have reason to make a request to the two authors, that is: I hope that Mr. Xu's traditional Chinese paintings will collect more historical themes that can promote national consciousness in the future, so that traditional Chinese paintings will not only fulfill their duties in easy expression, but also be full of strong combativeness and promote more positive era significance. As for Mr. Qian's calligraphy, I hope to get rid of the old-fashioned inheritance as much as possible, especially the choice of calligraphy, and use self-created sentences or vernacular styles to express the author's emotions and intentions when necessary, because a brand-new form can be inlaid with brand-new content.</p>
<p>The life of art needs to be constantly infused with new blood!</p>

<h3>Bi Xiang Pavilion Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiaqing</p>
<p>Li Dongting asked me to inscribe on the Weiwanzai Building, saying that my hometown of clouds and water is good, thousands of miles of Dongting Lake; a vast expanse of blue waves, with guests exploring pearls. I live under Yueyang Tower, where the setting sun swallows the red light; I clapped my hands in surprise, embracing Lu Yang, how often have I dried my hair alone! Good times are passing, people are not old, the scenery is worth enjoying; Junshan is like a painting, smiling and looking at the scenery as it was in the beginning; leaving ten thousand acres of mulberry gardens, waiting to welcome the prosperity of the world, like unfolding the Wangchuan map. I am also half of the world, the rivers and seas remember water shields.</p>
<p>Partridge Sky: Lantern Festival to Sister Yu, Collecting Sentences from Baishi Daoren</p>
<p>Spring dots sparse plum branches after the rain, cutting lamp heart matters when it is chilly; now is the night for joyful travel, I am sad to return, there is moonlight left. Flowers fill the market, what a night! It has been a long time since the human world has been separated, and I am not sad. The railing stands on the back of the Azure Dragon, and the Feishui River flows eastward endlessly!</p>
<h3>Song</h3>
<p>— Hu Ne</p>
<p>Songs, majestic and sonorous, ignite the sparks of my youth, making me not sad, not discouraged, and increasing my determination to work hard and fight.</p>
<p>Therefore, I love songs, because the majestic and uplifting singing voice penetrates my heart and boils my blood; the inspiring and sonorous singing voice penetrates my heart and inspires my confidence; I will wipe away the past trauma and abandon the decadent thoughts in the song, live in an active world, and work for work!</p>
<p>I remember that "La Marseillaise" once saved the disappointed French soldiers; "The March of the Volunteers" will always make the volunteers in the Northeast persist in their determination to resist Japan for more than ten years.</p>
<p>What a great singing voice! It is our life's stimulant; like rain and dew, it nourishes people's hearts!</p>
<p>Song is the driving force of life, and it is the brilliance of people's lives!</p>
<p>I love songs. In the singing, I want to rise up, work tirelessly, and leave some precious traces.</p>
<p>I need singing even more to nourish my life and enrich my life; sadness, decadence, discouragement... stay away from me, let the majestic and sonorous singing accompany me. Because I am still young, I want to work.</p>
<h3>Composer Li Zi</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>The personality of the famous composer Li Zi (Frank Lizt) was originally very gentle, but sometimes he did very inhuman things. One day, a young composer sent him what he considered to be his masterpiece for Li Zi to correct, and Li Zi pointed out the worst section and said to him, "This is impossible in music."</p>
<p>"But," the young man said proudly, "I did it."</p>
<p>Li Zi sneered, dipped the steel nib in ink and arbitrarily sprinkled it on his coat. "This can also be done," he said, "but can this be done?"</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he ran out silently to buy the young man, who didn't know whether to laugh or cry, a new coat.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 517</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"I don't know. I just took a turn around the Wansui Hall and looked at your room with Miss Nakamura. There was nothing there... I inadvertently overheard the maids on duty revealing the news of the suicide, but no one explained the reason for the maid's suicide..."</p>
<p>"I do know!" Shouyi interjected when Zhengyan said this.</p>
<p>"You heard about it too?" He Jian, thinking that Shouyi hadn't been to Wansui Hall and that he hadn't mentioned the Korean woman to Shouyi, felt that Shouyi's words were somewhat abrupt, so he asked Shouyi this way.</p>
<p>"I just met that Korean youth again—the one who came to the hostel this afternoon—he told me that he had lost another helper. When I asked why, he said that he had two subordinates in the Wansui Hall, using the positions of maids as cover, paying attention to the Japanese movements, and one of them suddenly committed suicide; I guess that's the one Zhengyan is talking about."</p>
<p>"She committed suicide—the suicide note said she 'punished herself for dereliction of duty'! ...I guess it was because of Miss Pingzi's disappearance."...</p>
<p>"How is Pingzi's disappearance considered dereliction of duty?" He Jian felt that this "disappearance" had no connection with the Korean woman's suicide.</p>
<p>"Presumably, she thought she should have protected Miss Pingzi. When Miss Pingzi went out, she didn't report to headquarters, so headquarters didn't send anyone to follow and protect her..."</p>
<p>"I understand," He Jian seemed to realize something; "That letter in the morning must have been her route, sent by someone—the letter from the Korean patriots inviting Pingzi to meet at the Bund Park—since she was close to Pingzi, in principle, Pingzi's every move should have been watched at all times. Failing to report to headquarters, and failing to think of a way to send someone to follow and protect her, can indeed be considered dereliction of duty, but she shouldn't have committed suicide!"</p>
<p>"Their group rules are very strict, I think... Koreans have an unusually heroic temperament, especially under the oppression of the Japanese devils. She is a woman, naturally narrow-minded, so..."</p>
<p>Shouyi's argument was not yet finished when the car stopped abruptly. They had arrived at the meeting place in the Bund Park.</p>
<p>"Let me go and scout it out first, there seem to be two people under the shadows of the trees by the wall over there..." Shouyi said to He Jian and Zhengyan, and he got out of the car and walked towards the low wall of the park. In less than half a minute, he turned back and waved at the car, calling for Zhengyan. Zhengyan got out of the car and walked towards Shouyi. When the two faced each other, like worker ants delivering messages, they only touched once, their antennae touched, and they each walked away in opposite directions; Zhengyan walked towards the shadows by the wall, Shouyi got into the car and replaced Zhengyan as the driver; He Jian at this time crossed over the back of the seat from the back compartment to the front compartment, sitting next to Shouyi. The car sped off towards Hongzhen.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts While Moored</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>A certain philosopher said:</p>
<p>"Separation" gives us a foreshadowing of death; "Meeting" gives us a foreshadowing of resurrection. Meeting an old friend in a foreign land is indeed one of the great joys of life. Even if they are people who have no relationship, if they have been separated for decades, and suddenly meet, that kind of joy is indescribable. This is nothing else, it is entirely because of the psychological feeling of resurrection.</p>
<p>A rich man went bankrupt and talked about his rich life in the past whenever he saw people. He remembered his past at all times.</p>
<p>A poor man became wealthy, and he forgot the embarrassing situation of crying in a cowshed in the past, and took three wives and four concubines.</p>
<p>These two situations exist very commonly in our society. I find it very strange, does "wealth" hinder people's memories?</p>
<p>I thought of a story:</p>
<p>A rich man went to visit a philosopher.</p>
<p>The philosopher's house was very simply furnished. There was a large mirror leaning against the wall, facing the mirror was a glass window, and through the window, you could see pedestrians coming and going.</p>
<p>The philosopher pointed to the glass window and asked the rich man, "What can you see through this glass?"</p>
<p>"Crowds of people," the rich man replied.</p>
<p>The philosopher pointed to the mirror again and said, "What can you see through this glass?" The rich man looked at the mirror, at his own chubby head. He simply replied, "Me!"</p>
<p>The philosopher sighed and said sadly:</p>
<p>"It is the same piece of glass, but this one has a little more silver, so you can only see yourself, and you don't know that there are crowds of people."</p>

<h3>There are Too Many Mad Dogs</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau announced yesterday that, according to statistics, 3,287 rabies patients sought medical treatment from the Health Bureau last year, and 38 died from the disease. From January to April of this year, 976 people went to the bureau for injections, and 10 have already died. It can be seen that the threat of rabid dogs is extremely serious. The Health Bureau has now proposed three prevention methods, which will be approved and implemented in the coming days. We hope that these methods can be approved and implemented immediately, and that they will be implemented thoroughly and effectively.</p>
<p>Rabies is also known as hydrophobia. Patients become afraid of water when they reach a certain stage, and they are even afraid of hearing the sound of water. Hence the name. This is an infectious disease transmitted from rabid dogs to humans. However, those who suffer from this disease are not limited to dogs. Other animals such as foxes, wolves, weasels, and even certain sheep and birds can also be infected. In short, all warm-blooded animals have the possibility of being infected. Once they go mad, they will attack the other party as soon as they encounter stimulation, mostly with their teeth, but also with their hooves, horns, or even beaks. However, what we see most often are rabid dogs, so we call this disease rabies.</p>
<p>After a dog goes mad, its symptoms gradually evolve. It begins to show restlessness, likes to be alone, and collects grasses, ropes, and wood chips. It licks cold things such as iron and stones. Its sexual desire is extremely strong. After that, it swallows fur, wood, and even stones and soil, and its voice becomes hoarse. Finally, its limbs become weak, it staggers when walking, its head and tail droop, and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue. Then it slowly hides in a remote place and dies on its own.</p>
<p>Rabid dogs are scary because they bite people, and the people who are bitten will also go mad, and even die from madness.</p>
<p>However, what is even more terrifying is that even though the rabid dog is mad, it does not bite its owner. This is only because it is difficult to restrain it, and with a little carelessness, it will escape. Then, it will open its mouth and bite anything that is alive. If the rabid dog were to bite its owner, there would only be one victim, and it could be killed immediately, or even put to death before it bites. Now that it still retains this bit of "spirituality," it becomes a truly dangerous thing.</p>
<p>Rabid dogs also have two characteristics; first, they bite people silently, sometimes biting lightly, sometimes biting so hard that their teeth break and their gums twist, which shows their ferocity. Second, if they are unfortunately beaten, they can indeed "grit their teeth" and remain silent, unlike ordinary dogs that would scream loudly; even if a rabid dog is beaten until it bleeds and is injured, it can endure it silently. This is also a manifestation of ferocity.</p>
<p>The disaster of rabid dogs has been loudly called for prevention since last year, and it is unfortunate that this disaster is now rampant. The current methods used to prevent rabid dogs are inspection and injection. But there is also a simpler and more primitive method that we hope the authorities will adopt: during the period when rabies is discovered, all dogs must wear masks. Britain has not had rabies for more than 40 years since 1902. Their most effective method is to have dogs wear masks. The masks were not allowed to be removed for six months after the last rabid dog was discovered. Moreover, the scope of implementation at that time was extremely wide, including the entire three islands. We should adopt this method and disarm the rabid dogs.</p>
<h3>Strange Marriage Customs</h3>
<p>— Zhongli</p>
<p>When Mongolians marry, the husband is always five or six years younger than the wife, so men marry very early. When they marry, they must first worship sheep, then worship heaven and earth, Lama Buddha statues, and parents and relatives. On their wedding night, they do not enter the bridal chamber, but spend it in another Mongolian yurt or shed.</p>
<p>There are some aborigines on the Malay Peninsula whose marriages are in the form of exchange, such as friends exchanging wives, and sending their sisters to friends as wives.</p>
<p>In Gansu, China, it is common for several brothers to marry one wife together. If they do not have the strength to marry together, they can rent one for a period of time from someone who has a wife.</p>
<p>In Siberia, if a husband wears a torn hat covering his face, the wife knows that the husband does not want her and proceeds with the divorce.</p>
<h3>Everyone is a Fool</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhuo Chao</p>
<p>Hubbard said: "Everyone is a fool for at least five minutes a day, and even smart people are no exception."</p>
<p>Therefore, I always keep a notebook titled "The Silly Things I Did". I look at it from time to time to help me solve the biggest problems in life.</p>
<p>Former Minister of Finance H.P. Howell started as a small clerk in a rural store, and later became the credit manager of Carnegie Steel Company. Once, he told me one of his secrets to success: "For many years," he said, "I always carried a notebook in which I recorded all my work. Every Saturday night, I would look through this notebook and carefully reflect on everything I had done since Monday morning. I would ask myself, 'What did I do wrong?' How should I correct the things I did wrong?' I analyzed myself in this way. Sometimes I felt that this habit was very boring, but other than this, I have never tried any other more effective way to succeed."</p>
<p>Obviously, Howell's secret to success was stolen from Franklin. Every night, Franklin had a strict self-examination, which resulted in the discovery of thirteen major shortcomings, three of which were: wasting time, devoting himself to trivial matters, and arguing in vain with people.</p>
<p>Every day, Franklin would declare war on one shortcoming and maintain it for a full week. The second week, he would declare war on another shortcoming. Continuing like this for two years, he wrote: "There are three hardest things in the world: steel, diamonds, and knowing yourself."</p>
<p>What if someone accuses you of being a "damned fool"? Here's Lincoln's method: Once, Lincoln issued an order to transfer a certain army. At that time, Secretary of War Stanton believed that this order was extremely wrong, resolutely refused to accept it, and accused Lincoln of being a "damned fool". When Lincoln indirectly learned of Stanton's words, he said, "Stanton is right, I should reflect on myself." Soon, Lincoln actually withdrew the order.</p>
<p>Most of us ordinary people hate those who criticize us, but this is not right. We should welcome them instead, because in fact, we can hardly do more than three out of four jobs correctly. Old Roosevelt in the White House especially liked to be close to Einstein, because Einstein could often point out that 99% of his work was "completely wrong."</p>
<p>Rochefoucauld said: "The criticism of us by our enemies is much more accurate than our self-assessment."</p>
<p>In short, everyone is a fool. Only people like Howell and Franklin can create a great man. Are you the same kind of person as them?</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Our Predecessors</h3>
<p>— Yunjian</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Sishi, whose given name was Yunxin, was a Jinshi in the former Qing Dynasty, and was from the western countryside of Song County. He was a family friend of my family. He once told me before his death that his ancestor, Yicai, had bold literary talent and was thoughtful and discerning. Once pointed out, any article on scriptures and meanings would be instantly understood, so I often went to him for advice. One early morning, I went straight to his bedroom. Yicai had not yet gotten up, and I held the scriptures to ask him about difficulties. So he put on his clothes and got up, and explained it to me repeatedly and in detail. Just as he was talking eloquently, he suddenly wondered why he had lost a sock. I also inspected it for him, but could not find it anywhere. Finally, his grandmother found a sock for him in a box. The next morning, he said to me, "Last night when I went to bed, I couldn't get my sock off, which made me sweat a lot." When asked for details, he learned that he had been concentrating on explaining in the morning, so he had put both socks on one foot, so one foot had no sock. In the past, socks were made of earth cloth, and were double-layered, making them thicker and longer, reaching the knees, so he couldn't take them off when he went to bed.</p>
<p>There is another anecdote. One day, Mr. Sishi came to the city to meet guests. I went to tidy up my appearance. Just as I was getting a haircut, two or three people came one after another and sat waiting. The shop owner did not know what kind of person he was, and seeing that his clothes were plain, similar to those of a country person, he used a secret jargon in the industry, commonly known as "cut words," and instructed his partner, "This country person can be perfunctorily dealt with." Mr. Shi seemed to dislike it. Before long, the haircut and braid were finished. Mr. Shi gave him a string of copper coins, totaling seventy coins, commonly known as "one bull." In those days, an adult's haircut cost twenty copper coins, and a child's cost fourteen. No one would increase the price unless it was for a wedding or funeral. Now, the partner unexpectedly received a heavy reward for doing things perfunctorily, and was surprised and dared not accept it. Mr. Shi told him, "Don't be surprised, I am so-and-so, you can accept it." The shop owner then realized that he was Mr. Jinshi, and apologized sincerely. Ten days later, I went to get my hair cut again. The shop owner was very attentive and worked personally. The previous haircut took less than half an hour, but this time it took more than two hours, which shows his flattery. But Mr. Shi gave him fourteen coins, and the shop owner was even more surprised, thinking that if the previous perfunctory job was rewarded with seventy coins, why was he only given fourteen coins for being so attentive now? Mr. Shi then told him, "Don't be surprised, the money from before is a reward for today's diligence, and today's money is a penalty for yesterday's perfunctoriness." The shop owner had no way to respond, and didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The humor of the predecessors was like this.</p>
<h3>"Three Full Bellies Out of Ten People"</h3>
<p>— A Newsboy</p>
<p>Mr. Christensen, the director of the United Nations agency's information office, is truly heartless. He announced a tragic event at this International Food Producers Conference. He said: In this world, only three out of every ten people have full bellies.</p>
<p>How do the other seven people survive? Christensen did not explain. Probably some are only half full, some are digging up grass roots and bark, some are consuming their own fat, and some are obtaining calories from the sun? The way to survive is like this, so Christensen didn't say any more.</p>
<p>In our country, we understand the meaning of such news the most, especially when white rice prices are soaring to 400,000, we know that the fire of hunger is so unforgiving to its master. Although Adam and Eve had forbidden fruit to eat in the Garden of Eden, in this human world, every fruit tree has its ownership registered.</p>
<p>Naturally, when we think like this, we are extremely envious of the three people who can have full bellies. We are just worried that they may sometimes eat too much. If these three gentlemen use the food of ten people, then we really dare not think about it and cannot bear to think about it.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw said: "Seeing you is like seeing the cause of famine." We hope this is playful, not a testimony. It is very unpleasant and cruel for us to know that many people are hungry, while some are burping from being full.</p>
<h3>Turnip Silk Color Dress</h3>
<p>— Feng Qiuping</p>
<p>In recent years, short knitted garments have been popular in the market. Most of them have the same style, and it is rare to find something unique. The short spring dress in the picture is more beautiful and unique with a turnip silk wide border on the pointed heart-shaped collar.</p>
<p>Materials: Twelve strands of fine yarn, and two strands of dark color for edging.</p>
<p>Tools: A pair of single-pointed knitting needles, a pair of double-pointed knitting needles, a crochet hook, and an embroidery needle.</p>
<p>Starting: First, start from the back, one hundred and twenty stitches. Arrange the pattern of five rows of peach blossoms, sixteen stitches per flower, with nine stitches of plain knit in between. Knit one foot long in plain stitch. On both sides, increase one stitch every five rows, until it is four inches long. Increase one stitch every three rows, until it is five inches long. Open the armhole, the same as the ordinary method. The armhole is five and a half inches. The back width is one foot.</p>
<p>Front: The method of knitting the waist and the pattern is mostly the same as the back. Cast on sixty stitches on one side of the left flap, arrange two rows of peach blossoms, still with nine stitches of plain knit in between. Ten stitches on the edge, knit garter stitch. Decrease one stitch every inch at the collar, gradually decreasing to the armhole, which is five and a half inches. Sew it together with the back. The right flap is the same.</p>
<p>Sleeves: Cast on thirty-two stitches on the shoulder. First use two needles, knitting on both sides. Decrease one stitch every row, until it is five and a half inches to the armhole. Use four needles, join the circle and knit it, like an ordinary small sleeve. Knit garter stitch at the cuff, which is three inches long. Decrease the stitches to finish the cuff. The second sleeve is the same.</p>
<p>For the turnip silk, please refer to the 13th to 16th combined editions of Qiuping's Wool Embroidery Knitting Method, page 85, for the pattern and instructions. Knit a two-inch wide border and sew it on with an embroidery needle.</p>
<p>Use a crochet hook to knit fourteen rows of single crochet stitches at the waist, four inches long. Open three buttonholes in the front, and it becomes the latest type of knitted spring dress. (This picture shows Miss Yu Suqiu wearing this style of new dress)</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The small teahouse owner enthusiastically pulled out a wooden board for them to lay some bedding under the blue calico cloth, and they lay down randomly in the corner of the room. Lan herself still maintained her original calmness. Except for rapid breathing, she didn't show the kind of panicked and sorrowful expression that ordinary women have when they suddenly fall ill. She also declined the suggestion of another female troupe member and never took off her coat, which was due to her obsession with cleanliness.</p>
<p>Lu Qian found an opportunity to pull Lao Zhu outside the teahouse.</p>
<p>"Alas!" Before he could speak, he sighed first. "Lao Zhu, I think Mrs. Hu's illness is very serious! I just measured her temperature, didn't you see it too? It's already over forty degrees! The whites of her eyes are also very red. I'm afraid it's no use just taking a few aspirins. You have to quickly think of a way to help her!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, his eyebrows almost joined together.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu scratched his scalp wildly with his hand.</p>
<p>The bus they had taken earlier was clearly supposed to go to Jinchengjiang. Lao Zhu's original plan was to change to another bus after reaching Jinchengjiang, because he knew that Jinchengjiang was too small, and had been burned down twice in the past, so it was impossible to find a house to stay in. However, Lan suddenly fell ill, and so seriously, how could he have the courage to take her on the road again immediately?</p>
<p>"I just heard the teahouse owner say that there was another big fire here last night. A bullet car exploded, and all the houses were burned down! Alas, this unlucky place!" Crippled Lu reported another bad news.</p>
<p>Filled with unhappiness, Zhu Zhaonian scratched his scalp even harder; after a while, he looked at Lu Qian and shook his head, and said to him in a way that was both complaining and joking:</p>
<p>"No, Lao Lu, it should be said that China is unlucky!"</p>
<p>"Alas!" Lao Lu didn't say anything, but sighed again.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian had now changed his mind. He believed that it was obviously impossible to stay overnight in Jinchengjiang, and that there would definitely not be suitable medical facilities in this small town, so the only way was to quickly find a car and continue to move forward according to the original plan.</p>
<p>He first went to the highway checkpoint and waited for about an hour, making friends with a few people in power. There were quite a few passing vehicles, according to what they told him, but it was rare to find an air force bus that could carry thirty or forty people at once; unless he divided the entire group into several groups, then perhaps there was still hope that half of them could leave today. However, this was precisely what Lao Zhu was most unwilling to consider, because not only was it economically unaffordable, but also this group of poor artists who had been wandering for six or seven years had never had the habit of rushing ahead or falling behind.</p>
<p>"You can go to the town to search." A military policeman suggested to him.</p>
