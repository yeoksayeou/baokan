<h3>參會通過和平提案　交全體審查會討論　準備電促中共代表來京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕張羣定廿七日晚邀約章伯鈞，褚輔成，張難先，許德珩四氏，商談關於和平方案之如何進行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕參政會此次大會最大主題之呼籲和平間題，業於廿六日下午六時廿分在參會第十一次會議中提出，全塲空氣為之一振，各參政員爭相發言，造成大會開幕以來晨熱烈之一幕，揭破此一問題者為蕭一山之臨時緊急動議。該案連署人達九十九人之多，渠提出辦法三項：（一）迅即舉行全體審查會，討論和平問題，（二）組織特種委會，制訂具體方案。（三）由大會電吿中共參政員來京出席，共策國是，此項辦法，當經大會通過，並定廿八日上午舉行全體審查會，提出討論·該案由林虎主席宣布後，蕭氏即趨發言合，詳加說明，渠謂：目前致中共參政員電報無法拍出可利用廣播電台廣播。關於致電中共及和平問題之提案，大會秘書長邵力子即席報告，共收到十八件，連同本日收到孔庚等所提之臨時動議共十九件，主席團業經決定，將以上各案提付全體審查會審查。此一問題之提出，顯然引起各參政員之重視，起立發言參政員，計有孔庚·沙彥楷·羅夢舟·汪崇屏·江恒源·武肇煦等，僉認有迅速提付討論之必要，主席詢問有無異議後，當順利通過此案。至致中共之電文，主席亦宣布請秘書處代擬，提出廿七日上午第十二次會議中通過。</p>
<p>蕭一山等一百人所提之臨時緊急動議，全文如次：</p>
<p>和平為國人一致之要求，亦政府屢屢宣布之方針，本會為最高民意機關，對此攸關國運之大問題，實不容忽視，自集會以來，同人商討，各方呼籲，氣氛已瀰漫於全國，和戰仍繫於一綫，雖徵諸以往事實，前途未可樂觀，但知其不可為而為之，應為本會最後努力之方向，現會期有限，空談無補，擬請迅速舉行全體審查會議，詳加討論，再由主席團提出若干人，組織特種委員會，制訂具體方案，藉資進行，並即由大會電吿中共參政員來京出席，共策國是，放下武力，以解救民族之危機。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕參政員孔庚等四十餘人，於廿六日下午參政會十一次會中提出，並經決定交全體審查會審查之臨時動議，全文如次：「擬用大會名義，致電中國共產靠，請其迅即推派代表，並提出恢復和平方案，刻日來京，與本會所組織之團體進行商談，　則甘心危害民國，應由大會通電全國，籲請政府明令討伐，以維民命，而鞏固國家統一案。（理由）八年抗戰，國家元氣大傷，勝利後，應即共謀建國，不意共黨稱兵構亂，烽烟遍地，人民苦不堪言，雖經政府與之數度商談，迄不獲致協議，因之，人民之痛苦愈深，財政之危機益重，全國人民盼望和平如望歲，假若中共願和平，鐵路交通恢復，政府仍重申以政治方法解決中共問題之決心，本人以為：全國最高民意機關，似應代表全國人民致電中共，請其即推派負責代表，並提出恢復和平方案，刻日來京，與本會進行商談，以恢復全國和平，而拯人民於水火，鞏固國家之統一。（辦法）（一）由大會決議，用大會名義致電中共，請其迅派代表，並提出恢復和平方案，即日來京與本會進行商談。（二）由大會推定代表，組織一國體，與共黨進行談判，俟獲協議，再進而與政府商談決定。（三）如共黨仍無悔禍之意，拒絕推派代表及提出恢復和平方案，是甘心破壞民國，害國殃民，責任由共黨負之，應由大會通電全國，籲請政府明令討伐」。</p>
<h3>有關和談提案內容　邵從恩等建議組織和平促成會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕參政會廿六日第十一次會議中，通過交付全體審查會審查之有關中共問題和平談判之提案共十八件，案由如次：（一）李璜等十四人提，本會應請國共雙方停戰，以利和平建國，而蘇民困案。（二）楊毓滋等六人提，為籲請政府恢復和談案。（三）林虎等四十三人提，請中共放棄以武力奪取政權之政策，俾政府以政治方式解決中共問題之方針得以貫澈，而實現國家之和平統一案。（四）張瀾等五人提，政治解決黨爭，停止內戰，以恢復和平案。（五）江恒源等六人提，請迅速結束戰爭，恢復和平案。（六）桂芬等十人提，請決定國策，勿涉遊移，以奠國基案。（七）王孟鄰等十九人提，請以大會名義，闡明政府與全國人民對於和平統一之希望，電吿中共，勸其遵守民主案。（八）張金鑑等卅人提，擬請用大會名義籲求中國共產黨體恤民命，停止武裝鬥爭案。（九）陸宗騏等六人提，擬請本會重申和平救國要旨，以期减輕戰禍，保存國家元氣案。（十）何葆仁等十二人提，擬請本會迅速連絡全國民意機關及人民團體，發動和平統一運動，以維國本案。（十一）謝明霄等六人提，擬請轉請國府，對於擁兵叛國之共產黨，明令討伐，並由同人發動全國輿論，集中力量，為政府後援案。（十二）張登鰲等九人提，如何採取更為有效之方式，謀求實現永久性的眞正和平，以免誤國誤民案。（十三）邵從恩等十九人提，為促成和平，請由本會組識和平促成委員會案。（十四）王曉籟等七人提，請由本會呼籲並斡旋和平，以挽救國家危亡案。（十五）葉道淵等五人提，應請國共恢復和談，以維民生，而固國本案。（十六）陳賡雅等八人提，請政府迅採政治方法，促成和平統一，以利實行憲政，而固國本案。（十七）王國源等十一人提，請由大會籲請政府，一面致電共方立即停止戰爭，組開和平聯合大會，解決當前大難案。（十八）沈之敬等廿一人提，組織和平期成會，促成停戰，實現和平案。</p>
<h3>報告階段即冠成　參會明審查提案　昨日會中報告內政水利</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕參政會四屆三次會開幕以來，已歷七日，大會報吿階段即將完成，截至廿六日下午止，僅有地政·衞生·經濟·資委會及善後救濟四項尙未提出報吿。廿六日下午十一次會中，宋宜山等提出臨時動議謂：地政·衛生兩部成立未久，地政·衛生兩部之工作情形，業包括於行政院之書面工作報告中，為節省大會時間，改在審查會中舉行，當經大會通過。廿七日大會，將為經濟。資委會及善後救濟報吿，預料當日可以感事，廿八日起開始提案審查工作。</p>

<h3>敎長繼續答覆　各項口頭質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕參政會第十次會議廿六日上午九時廿分舉行，出席參政員二〇四人，李璜主席，繼續提出敎育報吿之口頭質詢計十二人，至十時卅分畢，旋由朱敎長答覆，達一小時之久，主席即宣佈休息。十一時三刻繼續開會，由水利部長薛篤弼報告水利工作，至十二時廿五分畢，當宣讀書面詢問廿件，口頭質詢有薛明劍等四氏發言，因時間過遲，續有口頭詢問均改作書面詢問。同時薛氏答覆亦改為書面答覆，下午一時散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕參會第十次會中張其昀等十二人所提出對敎育報吿之質詢，仍側重於學潮。張其昀認為和平。物價，興學潮均有連帶關係，盼能以此三項問題，聯合作一檢討，求得結論，再通過國務會議由政府付諸實施。黃宇人認為學潮之成因，一部份自係受不良份子之煽動，但大多數學生則由於不滿現狀，不滿政府之腐欺，王化民提出，敎育部所設公費生大部在京滬一帶學校，而此輩學子，其中甚多富家子弟，反之對東北無家流亡靑年則無公費，實不公允。韓春喧謂，東北靑年在受了十四年奴化敎育後，回到祖國懷抱來，尙不能安定讀書。要求敎部對東北敎育復員經費事予以澈查。于汝洲為東北學生學習英語之困難呼籲，同時提出邊疆敎育經費太少，應使邊敎得以普遍。李培國謂，熱河小學七千多，中學廿餘，免無一國立者。詢問完畢，朱部長於十時三十五分開始答覆。朱氏首對學潮問題表示不幸，其次分別說明各項問題：（一）會考總考制度，會考自民廿二年始舉行，從未停頓，惟卅四年時曾停一次，卅五年復因遷校又停一年，今年恢復舉行，現決今年仍暫停一年。總考前年即由各校斟酌辦經，去年即有若干校未辦者，今一仍然係斟酌辦理，且着重「斟酌一二字。（二）男女分校問題，此項制度尙係民十七年第一次全國敎育會議時所決定，今年僅重申前令而已，並未特別提出。參政員中有提出小學敎員以女子祖任為原則者，本部擬增設女子師範學校。（三）英士大學遷校問題，敎部曾鄭重考慮，原係二十四年敎育復員會議時決定同時經校方同意設金華者。（四）交大部份，在更名一點，實係誤傳，因當時有南北洋大學在中國敎育史上乃具有光榮紀錄者，南洋大學即交大前身，本人在談話時偶提及此事，但用交大之名已十餘載，自仍用交大名而不必變更。關於航海輪機兩系事，在光緒年間曾辦過航海科，至光緒末年成立上海吳淞商船學校，故原有航海科學生即移轉至商船學校，在商校畢業，交大即無航海系矣，抗戰伊始，商船學校被毀，敎部在渝復辦，惟該校幾度發生風潮，經予停辦，其遺留學生由敎部委託交大代辦，至是交大要求恢復航海系，敎部以兩系已撥商船學校，故准予以新生撥商船學校，舊生則留交大，惟現交大再請求恢復航海系，並致釀成學潮。關於工學院設輪機系，原不合理，但因校方要求而批准。（五）中正大學乃戰時成立，設備困難，敎授待遇低，致發生風潮，敎部曾派員前往會同校長解決風潮。（六）湖南大學改名嶽麓大學事，當時經湘省敎界人士表示贊同，湘主席王東原氏亦盼能早日改名，敎部即有改名之意，惟並未決定，現仍為湖大。（七）湖北師範學院問題，初因地址未定，復員經費又少，院長不願回院辦理，致成問題。（八）北平師範大學復校問題，按師大為一有歷史之學校，戰後遷至西安併入西北聯大復員後，因僅文理兩院，故即恢復北平師範學院，不能稱大學，將來當成立完全大學。（九）天津工商學院要成立文科，敎部覺得「工商」不能成立文科，該院復要求改為大學，敎部認為應辦改大學之手續。（十）敎育經費太少，正想辦法以謀解決，公費生問題則牽涉太大。（十一）學潮風氣問題，大部份學生確為純潔份子，政府此次命令，乃為普遍處理治安問題之辦法。朱氏答覆達一小時之久，至十一時卅五分始畢。</p>
<h3>蔣主席定期　邀宴參政員</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕蔣主席定廿七晚，邀宴國民黨參政員，廿八晚宴全體參政員。</p>
<h3>內政報告及質詢　參政員提請速澄清吏治</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕內長張厲生廿六日下午在參會第十一次會議席上作內政報吿，並答覆詢問。張氏報吿係就該部所轄各項業務，如地方行政，地方自治，選舉·警政·禁烟等項作詳盡之說明。渠談及出版法之修改問題時稱，滬文匯·聯合·新民三報之停刋，內部至今午止，尙朱接獲任何報吿，將來自當查明。最近見若干報紙刋載之消息與事實不符，實有擾亂社會秩序之情形，政府為維持社會之治安，自應加以取締，惟處置時復有若十困難。對於報紙，吾人希望能使言論走上正軌，故出版法業已修改完成，即可送立院。其中對於過去限制過嚴各點，均已予放寬。</p>
<p>秘處宣讀　　問廿一件後，開始口頭質詢，發言者咸着重於整頓吏治。馬乘風謂目前我國政治一大缺陷，即在中央集權，一切力量集中於中央，形成各地政府均無能力，省政府僅為承轉機關。關於大選之準備工作，馬氏認為在全國尙未和平統一以前，如不顧及實際軍事情勢，普選實難進行。沈之敬提出，保警工作不易做好，同時提出瓊崖吏治之腐敗，有「十殺」之條例，致人民無生路。范承樞提出四點：即機關太多，用人太濫，法令太籠統，人民負担太重，請內部注意。潘朝英亦提出，海南島捐稅太多，民不聊生，土匪逼地，請內部注意。江恒源提出，請注意保障人權，以慰人民。陳逸雲提出，地方基層政治缺點，粵東莫縣保安隊長係一有案可稽之漢奸，且為非作歹無人敢加干涉，請張部長嚴辦。陳賡雅對選舉問題，認為對候選人資格應予嚴查，報紙登載失實新聞應依法辦理，予以通知警吿。盧前首談社會風氣之轉移，認為上行下效，實有追究責任之必要。其次對於社會賢達之解釋，予以詢問。末認為省縣長之任期及地方自治經費，應予議定等等。朱益淸謂選舉問題過去幾為警察包辦，盼今後能注意改善。羅衡提出，各級民意機構之選舉，婦女名額應予規定，婦女職業應有保障。關於吏治問題，貪汚者不辦，吏治自無法整頓。</p>
<p>張氏對口頭質詢即席答覆，關於整頓吏治事，渠稱地方問題凡吿知者，一定予以處理。詞畢，金振玉提詢滬市立委名額問題，張答以本人無決定權。</p>
<h3>水利質詢</h3>
<p>重黃河堵口工程</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕參政會廿六日上午水利報吿後，秘書處即宣讀姚廷芳，伍智梅等參政員所提書面詞間二十餘件，繼有薛明劍，馬景常等參政員分別作口頭質詢，詢問中最多者當為堵口復堤一尋。彼等咸認為黃河堵口工程雖吿完成，黃河仍復故通，惟黃河下流復堤工程，則應加緊進行，而疏濬工作，亦須同時並進，滯則大汎來臨，又將造成新的泛區，如能與中隊配合保護，趕工防止共軍搗亂，尤所必需。關於此次堵口有功人員及專家，彼等認為政府應盡量延用，不可島盡弓藏。其次詢問中較重要之問題，則為全國之農田水利，尤應加緊興建。至如台灣原為產糧區，日人控制期間，即注重水利，今後尙有新的水利計劃，更為改進，則該省增產之食糧，當更可觀，同時內地亦可收到調劑之效。趙公魯並提保持水土培植水源之建議，馬景常盼調整水利機構，且應有專人負責，如揚子江水利委員會，導淮委員會等均應改為工程局，專負施工之責。至二部份行政設計，則由水利部主管，各參政員詢問畢，以時間不早，主席請薛部長均作書面答復。</p>
<h3>參政員臨時動議　請確保新聞自由</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕女參政員金振玉，廿六日向參政會提出臨時動議「請政府切實保護新聞自由及從業人員」，於下午十一次會議中提出討論，金氏並在發言臺上予以解釋，當經通過，提付審查。</p>
<h3>許孝炎氏提議　放寬報紙配額</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕許孝炎頃向參會提出有關新聞用紙一案。按目前政府對白報紙之外匯配額限定每三個月二百萬美元，許氏則請改為每月二百萬美元。</p>
<h3>主席派吳鼎昌　探問邵從恩病</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕邵從恩病勢，廿六日仍未見好轉，全日均在睡眠狀態中，下午注射「配尼西林」後，脈搏增至一百跳，體溫高至三十九度半，血壓低壓九十，高壓一百九十度，呼吸廿二次，據醫謂：低壓九十度為好現象，撿騐眼珠結果，發現並無溢血現象，過廿七日後，病勢若無變化，即可無虞。廿六日赴院探病者，有邵力子，盧前等，</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕蔣主席昨曾派文官長吳鼎昌代表，赴院探問邵從恩病。</p>
<h3>平津院校多復課　東大兩次爆炸幸未成災　筑渝各界擁護中樞法令</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕北大·淸華·燕京三校，廿六日已復課，情形良好，負有宣傳聯絡任務之學生，為「六二」仍積極工作中。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿六日電〕北洋平部·鐵院及朝陽三校，因各該校本身問題尙未解決，迄無復課表示，校方正在積極勸導中。</p>

<h3>上海市民的迫切呼號</h3>
<p>上海市參議會第一屆第三次大會於一昨開幕，本報著論，所以以「安定第一」的呼號相貢獻者，因為我們覺得在目今動盪的局面下，必先安定之後，始能言和平，言復興，言建設。國內的局勢如此，地方的局勢亦如此。上海為我國第一都會，出現在上海的局勢，從一個較廣的角度來看，是與整個國內局勢不可分的；然而上海一隅的局勢發展，又往往足以影響其它各地。上海市參議會為上海市民代議的機關，在從事於安定的努力上，自不能不從這兩方面分頭進行：其有屬於地方性者，市參議會固義不容辭，卽屬於全國性者，亦責無旁貸。</p>
<p>市參議會三次大會召開的第一日，我們看見在豫備會議中，急不暇待，就有臨時緊急動議案兩件，獲得大會的通過。第一件是徐寄廎等四十三人提「擬請本會勸告中共恢復和談，學生卽日複課，並擁謎政府維持秩序，促成永久和平，以求國家之統一，社會之安定案，」另一件為張中原等一百另二人提：「念電參政會及全國各省市參議會，向共產黨負責人諍吿，立卽派員恢復和談，化干戈為玉帛，拯人民於水火。」這兩案雖尙有待於今日第一次大會的追認，然昨固已經過熱烈討論。而獲得全塲一致的通過。其辦法要點為（一）通電全國各法團，一致電請國民政府及國民參歡會，主張由國民政府從速限定日期，令飭中國共產黨迅卽放下武器，停止叛亂，聽候統編，果能如期履行，自可視為政黨，仍予寬容，國軍亦卽就地停戰，不事追勦。倘再執迷不悟，弄兵如故，政府應卽集中全力，明令戡亂，並由該會聯合各省市民意機關，電達中共，致其最後之忠吿；（二）發表文吿，主張各黨派履行一律退出學校之成議，請罷課學生之家長，迅卽各自勸導子弟，尅日復課；（三）擁護國民政府頒布之維持社會秩序臨時辦法及上海當局所訂定之四項執行辦法。以上各項文吿，截至寫稿時止，我們雖還不曾讀到，但有此緊急臨時動譏的通過，已可知本市的參議會如何在謀安定的實現。全市人民自無不鼓起莫大的興奮，而寄予殷切的期望。</p>
<p>我們於讀到市參議會通過的這兩件提案後，首先感動欣慰的是此兩案的提出，實代表了上海市民一般的意向。在瘡痍遍地的戰後中國，我們所需要的是統一，安定，與和平。中國的人民，實在再也不能容忍現局　的長此拖延下去，我們立卽需要安定。惟有安定，我們纔可望休養生息。現局勢是一種極不合理的局面，雙方在用兵，在用兵之中，一方還要說和平之望未絕，而一方却更步步加緊其軍事攻勢與政治騷擾。在這一種局面下，和平旣不是事實，安定又不可能，而且在政府又彷彿是師出無名，以致社會益增其動盪，人民愈感其痛苦。在一切為着安定的努力，我們首先要致力於大局的安定，然後纔能獲得地方的安定。所以我們歡迎上海市參議會有此兩案的通過。</p>
<p>至於說到中共方面，我們旣曾再三著論，希望中共能以人民為重，立刻放下武器，與其它和平合法的政黨一樣，携手合作，來共謀中國之民主化和現代化早日實現，我們以為凡政黨必應有主義，主義可不同，但為增進人民福利和民族利益的目的，當無二致。在這一個共同的大前提下，各政黨自無不可以合作。我們深知中國共產黨是一個有主義的黨，但我們深信他們終究還應該具有增進人民福利和民族利益的目的。在這個大前提下，我們希望他們終當鑒於一般人民的迫切呼號，而毅然放下武器，使久在苦難下過日子的中國人民能够稍資喘息。上海市參議會旣有上項臨時動議的通過，我們希望全國民意機關一致起而饗應，喊出全國人民一致的呼號：救救我們在苦難下過日子的人民，我們要求局面的安定！</p>
<h3>學生確應懸崖勒馬了！</h3>
<p>上海學潮，今日殆將到了轉捩的關頭。平息嗎？擴大嗎？將至於不可收斂嗎？就要看青年學子如何運用其更行了。昨日吳市長招待記者，謂本市被捕學生，除有煽動罷工罷市嫌疑者外，已與宣司令商定，準由各該校條及家長領回，各校學生亦由其代表面允今日全部復課。宣司令亦有同樣談話，惟稱如學生仍繼續從事破壞秩序之煽動宣傳，則仍將予以拘捕。一時來勢汹汹的學潮，至此宜可望其平靖。安定第一旣為上海市民一致的呼號，我們無日不希望學潮得以早吿平息。如今吳市長旣宣布其與交大學生談話的結果，各校今日可全復課，此次風潮可謂已成過去。我們首先不得不稱頌吳市長舉措的賢明，與當局愛護青年的一番至意。學生都受相當的敎育，大學生知識水準尤高，祇要他們洋溢的感情遲早能為理智所克服，則以吳市長態度的誠懇和處置的合理，應該感動每個純潔的學生，使他們恢復上課的。</p>
<p>學生是知識人士的前衛，當血氣方剛之年，追求理想，不滿現實，因而有所謂學生運動，這原是可以了解的。倘使運動的目的純正，行動不越常軌，自必能博得社會一般的同情，達到預期的目的。卽使縱或因感情的一時不能自制，容或不免越軌，如果理智能够及時回復，行動納入正軌，亦未必不能為世人所諒。此次學潮如果得以漸歸平息，便由於更行的克服情感。可是據撰稿時所得消息，一部分學生於被捕學生釋放後，昨晚又復召集會議，深夜未散，似有堅持罷課之說。此一消息，固尙有待於今晨事態的證實，但我們希望大部學生仍能認淸事實，不再為少數別有懷抱者所利用，使此次的學潮能够就此平息下去。當今民族遭逢空前的危難，全國人民一致所要求的是安定，學生是知識份子，尤應深體時艱，先從安定自己勤求學問做起。若果不幸未能趨於平息，是其運動，顯將走入歧途，甚或不能再被看作一種學生運動，而破壞社會秩序，妨害公共安寗，豈非更將自蹈法網？我們以為學生們確已應該懸崖勒馬了！</p>

<h3>英工黨大會揭幕　主席諾爾貝克發表演說　力主促進國際合作關係</h3>
<p>〔聯合社英國地蓋特廿六日電〕英航空大臣即工黨執委會主席諾爾貝克，今日在工黨年會致開幕詞，號召英政府率先在世界各國人民間，樹立平等與信賴之新關係。據稱，「英舊內部困難問題，筍與世界所遇重大問題相較，實甚渺小。當前重大任務，乃在堅定基礎上建立和平·英政府亟應設法發農全世界各大陸在經濟上互相合作之新制度，其發展之高及期望之大，當為吾人前所未知。抑吾人首須消滅舊過失，樹立新關係，即西方歐洲美洲人民與世界其他人民間之平等與信賴關係。吾人須使聯合國機構成為左右國際事務之因素，如果予以時間，此世界和平機構必能完成其任務。任何人若以為聯合國機構業已經過試騐而失敗，適足表示其愚昩無智。但吾人仍須使盟邦蘇聯深信英國之眞正利益，與彼等之利益並不衝突，吾人更須使彼等確信各國社會制度雖然不同，仍能藉聯合國憲章而生活，共謀親睦和平。吾人若能終止戰爭恐懼，則殆無力量所不逮之事業，吾人能使中東已獲灌漑之區域，增加五或十倍，能導海入薩哈拉沙漠，改變半個大陸之氣溫，更能引水至南非洲卡拉哈利荒瘠區，使成一片新土地，供白人與黑人居住。中國有十餘河流須建水庫，請諸君聽信，以上種種工程較諸雷達與原子彈不啻兒戲。—吾人尙須記取英國之貿易糧食原料，進而至每一家庭之生活標準，乃依賴於各大陸，而非依賴一個大睦。」諾氏繼為工黨政府對內對外工作之成績熱烈辯護，號召全國擁護政府外交政策，並重申貝文外相近在下院所發之言，即英國仍視本身為一大强國是。據稱，「外國人切勿相信英國已沒落式微，英國之實力在其人民，在其對自治領之連繫，在其與過去曾共同維護正義各國之友誼。英國人民較前更為健全，敎育程度更高，更富創造力，不列顚共和國更趨團結，而英國對各大陸其他國家之友誼眞實而堅强。」</p>
<h3>對「叛黨」黨員　莫理遜發警告</h3>
<p>〔路透社瑪蓋特廿五日電〕樞密大臣莫理遜於工黨大会在此召開之前夕，發表對於工黨「叛黨」黨員之警吿，謂有時個人主義使用過度，形成混亂紛雜之局勢，對於國家實有損而無益。工黨雖承認议会制度所需要之適當自由，但亦盼望本萬黨員勿使船舶處於觸礁之危險。若工黨能保持優良形式，本於善良動機而活動，必能保持其權力。</p>
<h3>貝文定週四　為政策辯護</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社瑪蓋特城廿五日電〕工黨本日會議分二次同時舉行，其一在麗都戲院發言者除興威爾之外，尙有拉斯基敎授及樞密大臣莫里遜；另一在冬季花園舉行，發言者有財相達爾禮等。大會議程中議案原有六百件之多，但其中大半已被收回或合併。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瑪蓋特廿六日電〕工黨大會議程中，原有兩項動議案，（一）對政府之巴勒斯坦政策，影響「英國在海外之良好聲名」，表示惋惜。（一）為敦促政府將管理聖地責任，立即移交聯合國機構，現已一併删除，致大會有關巴勒斯坦之決議案僅餘一件，貝文外相定星期四在大會發表有關巴勒斯坦之文論。議程中關於外交之決議案，已减為十五件，內容對下列兩事表示扼腕：（一）英國對希臘政策，結果已使反動政府當權；（二）英國在安理會中，全力贊助美國對希土之行動。另一決議案承認「對美國須保持極密切關係，但對蘇聯獲得極密切之合作同樣重要」。其他決議案為贊同貝文之外交政策，及號召歐洲社會主議運動團結一致，加速歐洲經濟與政治復興。</p>
<h3>各國賠償代表　視察日兵工廠</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿六日電〕各國賠償代表本週及下週之視察程序，包括日本海軍兵工廠，陸軍兵工廠，飛機製造廠，及商辦之軍需廠各一所。按劃作賠償之飛機及軍火製造廠共六百五十九所，如包括官辦及商辦之工廠機器合計，則逾三萬件，彼等業已視察者，僅十三所。據我國代表稱，渠等所最注意者為工具，因其裝置較易，利用較速也。我國將來所獲賠償之機械工具，足供設立二十所機械工具廠之用。</p>
<h3>日紗上月產量　打破戰後記錄</h3>
<p>達三千四百八十萬磅</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿六日電〕日本棉紗生產，自去年十一月起，每月均大有增加，計去年十一月為二千三百六十萬磅，十二月為二千六百九十萬磅，本年一月為二千零六十八萬磅，本年一月為二千零十八萬磅，二月為三千零七十萬磅。四月份　量則打破戰後紀錄，達三千四百八十萬磅。</p>
<h3>對日和約地點　澳擁護美建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雪梨廿六日電〕此間「太陽報」載康白拉訪員來電稱：澳大利亞外長伊凡特當擁護之美國動議，將珍港定為解瘊對日和約之地點。</p>
<h3>蘇科學家採測　日本海漁業</h3>

<h3>日組閣工作仍少進展　片山作最後努力民主黨起草新折表衷方案</h3>
<p>〔新亞班東京廿六日電〕片山組織四黨聯合內閣之工作，至本日下午三時半所召開之片山·吉田·蘆田三黨首腦會談，似已接近最後努力之階段。自由黨總裁吉由今晨自熱海溫泉回東京後，即於十一時召開該黨幹部會議，會中再强調旣定方針。會畢大野通知西尾，謂自由黨仍拒絕入閣。同時，片山與吉田新舊兩首相辦理移交手續，手續完畢後，即邀請蘆田氏至首相官邸，舉行三黨首腦會談。討論中心仍為；（一）不洩漏閣議之秘密，及（二）避免惹起社會不安之言動。但以上兩項，在今日之會談中，仍未獲得結果，定明日再舉行三黨首關會談。是則組閣工作，又將拖延一日。在此種微妙之發展，組織聯合四黨內閣之成敗，頗難預料，據西尾於會後發表談話稱：「四黨聯合內閣之可能性，原只有百分之三十，今日三黨首會談後，已增至百分之五十。」</p>
<p>〔國際社東京六日電〕民主黨蘆田總裁吿記渚稱：「今日三黨首腦會談時，余與片山首相曾教請自由黨協力四黨組閣工作，吉田答以此事須與然內會商後作覆，綜觀會談經過，自由能度已轉軟化，民主黨且將提出信其可使雙方關係協調之折衷方案，故四黨組閣前途可望好轉。」</p>
<p>〔國際社東京廿日電〕民主黨夭野政調會長及小坂善太郞頃由黨內委為四黨新協定方案起草委員，根據廿六日三黨黨首會談結果，着手草擬各黨間之新折衷方案，並定廿七日午前十一時召開黨內幹部會議將其內容進行硏討，然後交由蘆田總裁在預定是日舉行之第二次三黨黨首會談時提出討論。</p>
<h3>麥帥發表佔領報告　檢討日本共黨實力</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿五日電〕麥帥頃發表佔領日本之報吿書稱：日本共產黨在勞工運動內之實力，殊難加以制定，因共黨常故意誇張其勢力故也。事實上共黨勢力所控制之組織參加全國工業聯合大會者甚衆，工業聯合大會之組織乃與美國工業組織大會相仿，與全國勞工聯合會同為日本二大勞工組織，會員共有一百三十萬人。日本目前勞工組織之實力，約有五百萬人，此外，日本農民組織，亦在發展之中，亦與共黨有關，農民聯合會於去年二月組織成立時，僅有會員二萬人，今已擴大至一百二十萬，其會員二萬人中，共產黨雖僅佔一千人，但因共黨紀律嚴密，行動一致，其勢力反較其所佔之人數為頸。就日本政員而發，共產黨分裂社會黨之努力，今已失敗，社會黨在最近大選中獨佔警劉，其主席片山哲現已被舉組織日本新閣。以曾日本之一般情形，則以經濟問題最為嚴重，政黨　　現正集中研究組遇通貨影攝及對付工會　力之措施，俾可穏定物價與工資之關係。</p>
<h3>帝大改名　尊稱廢止　日本之「民主」化</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿六日電〕久未召開之帝國大學總長會議，今日復在東京開會，決織：（一）在學士與博士中創設另一學位；（二）廢止「帝國」兩字，例如東京帝國大學稱東京大學。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿六日電〕片山首相於三黨會議完畢後，曾往訪松岡，松平衆參兩院議長。首相提議今後廢止「閣下」之稱呼，按此兩字向為高級軍官及政府實吏所襲用，至此遂隨新首相上臺而被慶止。</p>
<h3>飛機侵犯阿領空　希官方否認</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典廿五日電〕希臘宣傳部頃發表官報，否認阿爾巴尼亞所稱希臘侵入阿國領空及以機槍掃射人民一說。略謂，阿爾巴尼亞此種惡意宣傳，其目的殆欲轉移世人之注意，影響聯合國巴爾幹事實調查委會研究安全措施之工作，實則決無人受其愚云。</p>
<h3>埃總理半率代表團　出席安理會　為英埃爭議提申訴</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅廿五日電〕埃內閣於召開會議後宣布：埃總理諾　拉西將親率代表團赴美，向聯合國安理會陳訴埃及與英國就修改條約問題之爭執。代美團團員有敎育部長仁國利·工商部長希爾資·公共工程部長及參議員拉姆齋等，埃駐美大使哈森，駐聯合國機構永久代表福齋，亦將為代表之一。埃總理等啓程日期猶未定。</p>
<h3>韓北蘇佔區糧食奇缺　大批難民逃韓南　若干難民曾獲蘇聨當局准許</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城廿五日電〕美蘇混合委員會現正在此間舉行會議，俾決定朝鮮之前途，對於程序問題辯論不已。同時大批難民，則每晚越過美蘇佔領區之邊界，進入美國佔領區，希望尋覓工作與糧食。目前沿兩區之分界綫一帶，已建有臨時難民收容所七所，每日收留難民四千人，有時甚至六千人。法國新聞社記者本日訪問難民收容所，共有營帳八十個，十日來已收留難民一萬人，其中十分之三年均在十八至四十之間，多半來自期鮮北部，但亦有來自中國東北邊界者，因蘇聯佔領區糧食奇缺，故相率逃至美國佔領區。若干難民前來南部，曾獲得蘇聯當局之准許，但多數則係私越邊界。彼等均異口同聲謂：蘇聯哨兵絕少向難民開槍射擊，此等難民在臨時收容所停留二三日之後，即遺往其所選擇之地點，不取任何費用云。</p>
<h3>美蘇委會發表公報</h3>
<p>〔聨合社漢城廿六日電〕美蘇混合委員會討論朝鮮臨時政府問題今日發表公報稱：會議停頓一載，已於上週恢復，此後至少每星期可發表公報一次。是為與一年前啣接之第九次公報，內中詳述委員會之設立及其議定程序，並稱，委員會曾考查由新聞界報導會議進行之最佳方法問題。鑒於朝鮮及各國人民均有儘量獲悉混合委員會協助成立朝鮮臨時政府工作之權利，准於解決每一問題後聯合發表詳細公報，每星期至少一次。兩國代表團長並有權與新聞記者作非正式會晤，吿以可與公開之一切事實。美國代表團長上星期五曾招待記者，蘇聯代表亦表示日內將舉行記者招待會。</p>
<h3>英美談判已歷多時　擬提高德工業水準　外長會議失敗後之演變</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕關於蘇聯在莫斯科會議中拒不對德國間題成立協議一事，英美兩國已準備即予答覆，英美此舉將先合併德國西境，提高德國之工業水準，即增加其鋼鐵生產至二倍上為答覆。自莫斯科會議後，英美進行此項談判已歷多時，此舉殆亦為馬歇爾國務卿之初步行動，以警吿壓戰之世界不能再容德國問題僵持不決。英美當今之目的，惟在先行提高德國之生產，促進其輸出貿易，使之可以償付輸入貨物，進而先使英美佔領區可以自給自足。莫斯科會議時因蘇法二國反對德國統一經濟，故英美今已決定先在其佔領區內採取此行動，且事實上，德國鋼鐵生產及其他工業皆位於英美佔領區內，尤其是魯爾區，故英美今或使其鋼鐵每年之產量增至一千二百萬噸，確數尙待最後協議時再加以決定。</p>
<h3>蘇聨羅致六萬科學家　組織礦苗搜索隊　規模之大為近代國家所未有</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕美衆院戰爭調查委員會主席勃萊斯特廿五日警吿稱：渠自權威方面獲悉，蘇聯已在發動歷史上規模最大之礦苗搜索，參加此搜索之科學家工程師技師等達六萬名之多，搜索地區廣達卅八萬五千方哩。勃萊斯特函致公共土地小組委員會主席梅隆稱：蘇聯在十八個蘇維埃共和國內羅致科學人員，組成八百單位之地理探險隊，以搜尋油·鐵·螢石及其他礦苗。勃萊斯特警吿稱，夭然資源之缺乏，與否可能為引起戰爭之主要原因，幷謂，蘇聯之行動係對美國挑戰，其搜索之範圍及非任何其他國家所能望其項背。史達林之生產目標，計銑鐵五千萬噸·鋼六千萬噸·煤五億噸·油一億六千萬噸。蘇聯現正使用最新式之自動鑽孔機，其効率較各地听使用者大二倍云。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕共和黨參議員勃魯斯特今日稱，渠接獲蘇聯方面之準確可靠報吿，謂蘇聯政府及人民正組織大規模之鑛質搜索運動，規模之大為近代國家所未嘗有。該報吿並未說明所搜索者，是否為鈾或其他原子分解物質，據一前被蘇聯所俘現被引渡來美所供波斯頓某一叛國案審判中作證之德陸軍軍醫稱，蘇聯已獲有大致完備的原子能知識。蘇聯現在黑海某孤島派駐德國科學家多人從事研究，渠獲釋前，曾與此輩德國科學家晤談，彼此所知不謀而合。</p>
<h3>蘇聨捕鯨隊　自南極返國</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科廿五日合電〕蘇聯南極捕鯨隊，已開始返國，彼等在南極滯留五月，共獲鯨魚五百尾。</p>
<h3>威爾斯演說　暢論印度朝鮮問題　希望各該國領開合作</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕前副國務卿威爾斯今日發表每週廣播演說稱：印度與朝鮮不能眞正獨立，除非各該國領袖願意放棄目前之難　及自私的雄心，而加入促進全國福利之重大任務。朝鮮民主黨領袖李承晚反對朝鮮之託管制度，實為遺憾。李氏及其朝鮮南部之保守派要求立即獨立，事實上朝鮮南部目前僅可在託管協定下獲得獨立。再者朝鮮經日本多年控制及美蘇兩國佔領之結果，朝鮮人不立即擔負獨立之責任與義務，不遭政治與經濟混成及內戰之拖延。朝鮮各民主政黨大多數領袖均願為樹立託管制度而工作，相信此乃到達自由之唯一出路。馬歇爾國務卿已獲得蘇聯外長莫洛托夫之同意，恢復美蘇聯合委員會之談判。此乃積極的成就。此外，馬歇爾又表示政府將要求撥款七千八百萬美元，援助朝鮮南部人民。此項積極步驟，乃為朝鮮人民之眞正利益着想。至以印度之分治可能性而論，除非各黨能成立若干切實手法，使地方自治政府在外交，國防，財政與金融上與聯邦之管理一致，則新印度國家的觀念應予放棄云。</p>
<h3>義組閣工作　已遭遇重大困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：受命組閣之加斯貝利今日向義總統報告其兩日來進行組閣之情形，歷時九十分，事後對於渠已否接受閣挨命令，拒不透露。觀察家由此推測，認為加氏對于調和各黨意見組織全國統一內閣，必已遭遇重大困難。</p>
<h3>德境英美區　將發表重大聲明</h3>
<p>〔聯合社德國萊門廿五日電〕英國駐佔領區公使巴根漢今日宣佈，英美佔領區將於廿七日發表重大聲明，吾人可謂正臨歷史上新時代。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿五日電〕德境美國軍政府情報局長麥克魯爾將軍昨晚自德國返抵此間，頃向報界談稱：今日最大之問題乃在使德國人民學習如何與其他世界各國和平相處。惟德國人民刻正在飢餓綫上掙扎，且準備跳往任何能供應食物之四輪車，對於其政治領袖毫無信心，但轉向盟國，依賴其處理至其能自由行動而後已云。</p>
<h3>越盟總統拒絕　法方停戰建議</h3>
<p>〔法國新開社西貢廿六日鴛〕越盟電台今日宣布：胡志明總統已拒絕法國駐越專員彼拉特所提出之停戰要求。該電台廣播兩種呼籲，其一呼召越南革命軍抗戰到底，另一呼召法國人停止越南之流血。胡志明稱：法方之提案，碍難接受，且有侮辱性質，因其規定越盟軍隊需向法軍繳械，並准許法軍在越南全境自由行動及駐紥軍隊。</p>
<h3>聖地調查團開會　各代表於十日內飛巴勒斯坦</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿五日電〕聯合國將於廿六日開始硏究巴勒斯坦問題，此事雖有若干希望，但不能保證必可獲致為猶太人阿拉伯人及列强所均能接受之解決辦法。澳洲·加拿大·捷克·危地馬拉。印度。伊朗。荷蘭。秘魯。瑞典·烏拉圭及南斯拉夫所組成之十一國調查委員會負責調查此項世界上最困難之政治及社會問題。各代表刻已雲集於聯合國德部，等待調查會議開幕。調查二作定於九十八日內完成之。聯　秘書長賴伊深信調查巴勒斯坦之舉或可影饗聯合國之未來命運，將向十一國委員會發表簡潔之開幕辭。十一國委員會開幕後，各代表將選舉正副主席，及商討調查路程，調查地點為巴勒斯坦，可能包括倫敦，歐洲各地之難民營及阿拉伯同盟國家之各首都在內。調查委員會一行，除十一國代表之外，尙有各國專家及顧問等五十人，及聯合國人員五十名，將於十日之內乘飛機前往巴勒斯坦，十一國委員會在啓程之前，必有一番爭論，蓋猶太復國會發言人曾要求該委員會在調查過程中視察歐洲之流亡人民集中營一及猶太流亡人士，但阿拉伯諸領袖一方面又激烈反對研究移民問題。該委員會在決定應否赴奧國及德國一事以前，將聽取阿猶雙方之意見。該委員會對巴勒斯坦極端份子能否徇國之要求，在調查期內實行停戰一節，認為希望甚小。</p>
<h3>英對印度問題　十大結論</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教廿五日電〕政界人士相信印督蒙特巴頓勳爵與英英內閣之印度專家舉行迭次晤談後，已獲得十大結論：（一）一九四八年六月決為英國退出印度之限期；（二）政局之拖延，將使印度內政局勢更趨惡化，惟有兩大然之協定，始能阻止局勢之惡化；（三）在政治解決成立以前印度軍隊及公務機關之未來，不能獲得決定；（四）政治解決之拖延更將阻碍英國方面之移轉印度政權的立法程序，此項立法案不但具有英國對移交印政權之批准，亦具有整個不列顚共和邦對移交印度政權之批准英王於國會重開時之致　，必須提及印度法案，今距致辭之時，已僅五月；（五）英國決不提前退出印度或印度之一部，以防動亂危險；（六）英國必須向一個或數個負責當局移交印度政權；（七）所有今後一切憲政決議，應由印人自行為之，六月二日之德里會議，即在協助印度負責領袖決定統一式分治，使代表印度之一個或一個以上之當局得自英方接收政權；（八）現有之制憲議會可為國大黨，錫克族及君主土邦之代表機構，備印度領袖作民意表決，至於回敎同盟，以抵制此一制憲議會之故，勢須另設制憲議會；（九）印人自行迅速決定其地理上之疆界，對於惡化的局勢必有良好影響，當可使英印領袖集中力量於有關移交政權其他重大問題；（十）移轉政權工作之順利進行，可以增强英工黨政府之地位，蓋至今仍有一部份人反對工黨政府退出印度決策也。</p>
<h3>黑人慘遭虐殺　凶手竟判無罪　美報憤懣謂為全美之恥</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿五日電〕南卡羅里那州格林維爾城白稱人將黑種人維利愛爾私刑處死一案，被吿三十一人經當地法院宣判無罪開釋，美國南部各州白種人，雖多歡欣，但世界其他各地則均視為「狂暴海軍判」。此案被告之多與起訴速，在美國南部各州司法史上亦屬空前未見。被吿多為出租汽車司機，其中二十六人承認加入羣衆，將該黑人挾去痛毆，最後用槍擊斃。審訊後被吿三人立即論令開釋，其餘經陪審員會商五小時十五分鐘後釋放。倫敦每日快報稱，狂暴審判仍為美國南部之不成文法。惟遠在南部各州之報紙，對此亦多表示不滿。里區　時報稱，整個南部，整個國家，　將因此判決蒙羞。亞特倫達日報則稱此為政府之判決，法律已遭受私刑。梅菲斯商報稱，此為美國南部司法之悲慘日子。去年七月廿五日，將治亞州孟祿附近有黑人四名被白種暴徒二十名殺害，雖經懸賞三萬美元，兇手仍未有一人歸案。黑人犯罪者之命運則與此相反，上星期四喬治亞州薛爾伐尼亞地方法院審訊一黑人强奸白種婦女案，僅討論三分鐘，即判決被吿詹姆白朝處死刑，並將於六月十七日執行電刑。</p>

<h3>參議大會隆重開幕　議長祈求和平統一　欲謀全國安定應自上海開發始　市長請參議員共維地方治安</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第三次大會，於昨晨九時，在塘沽路參議會三樓大禮堂隆重開慕。出席議長潘公展，副議長徐寄廎，參議員一百五十人。吳市長曁各局局長處長及江蘇監察使嚴莊，市黨部主委方治等亦均列席。此次大會因適在社會被恐怖氣氛籠罩之下舉行，故會中情緒似較過去二次為緊張。潘議長，吳市長以及市參議員，咸表示吾人於目前最重要之工作及希望，乃求得社會安定，國家和平，參議會在此時此地，其責任將更為重大。</p>
<p>大會於昨晨九時半按新規定之開會儀式舉行開幕典禮。首由潘議長致開幕詞，略稱：今日為本會第三次大會開幕，適値國民參政會亦正開會。當此全國各地呼籲和平之時，各地共黨郤大加擾亂，破壞交通，致百業蕭條，民不聊生。學潮更此起彼伏，造成社會動盪，人心不安。上海之經濟文化地位，居全國首，欲求全國和平統一與社會安定，必先由上海開始。上海社會情勢與中國大局息息相關，故本會責任將更感重大。此次大會除討論通常議案，決定預算支出及檢討第一二次大會決議案之實施情形外，其尤重要者，為「如何求得國家大局眞正和平統一，如何求得上海社會安定。」否則，此種混亂局面如永遠任其繼續下去，一切希望將受阻碍，討論議案亦屬徒然。故吾人必須盡力解決此二大問題，然後始能「對得起上海數百萬市民，對得起自己良心！」</p>
<p>繼由吳市長致詞謂：本人於前二次大會中均提過三十六年為上海最困難時期，今殆不幸而言中。正如議長所說，目前第一大事乃安定社會。蓋此時上海之動盪局勢確已威脅到每一市民之安居樂業，市府雖已盡最大力量消滅不安定因素，但因能力精力均有限，不能不請參議會諸公指敎，提出大方針，使不安定成為安定，共同維持地方治安。　嗣奚玉書代表參議員致答詞，略謂：今日本會開幕，聞議長市長所言，有無限感觸。參議會在社會如此不安定情形下，責任實更重大。但安定責任並非在市長一人或軍警參議會身上，實乃全體市民之責任。參議會乃市民與市政當局間之橋樑，希望將此危險時期安然渡過。此外並有感想數點：（一）物價高漲至此程度，政府亦應負一部分責任，希望中央以後對決定方針，應注意到地方情形。（二）市府預算受物價影響，難以平衡，仍望今後對建設經費之審核，從寬籌劃。（三）近聞中央有發行短期高利庫券消息，此對工商業商業銀行將有莫大影響，亦盼同人能注意及之。</p>

<p>關於前項議案中並訂有辦法五項：（一）由本會首先通電全國各法團，並號召本市各人民團體，一致電請國民政府及國民參政會，主張由國民政府從速限定日期令飭中國共產黨迅即放下武器，停止叛亂，聽候統編。果能如期履行，自可視為政黨，仍予寬宥，國軍亦即就地停戰，不事追剿。倘再執迷不悟，弄兵如故，政府應即集中全力，明令戡亂，以期早日平定，結束軍事，促成國家之統一，奠定永久之和平。同時本會當聯合各省市民意機關，另電中共，懇切致其最後之忠吿。（二）由本會即日發表文吿，主張各黨派履行一律退出學校之成議，請罷課學生之家長，迅即各自勸導，並約束其子弟，尅日復課，不可再為奸徒所利用，自蹈法維。並請全市各學校校長，不問學生到校若干，一律即日宣布正式上課，以正視聽。其有學生正當要求，可以容納者，本會為重視敎育及愛護靑年計，應代為力請敎育行政機關及學校當局不可固執成見，自宜斟酌情理，予以接受，使奸徒無隙可乘，學潮即得平息。（三）由本會再行發表文吿，擁護國民政府頒佈之「維持社會秩序臨時辦法，」及　海市政府與警備司令部會同訂定公布之四項執行辦法，希望切實執行。（四）由本曾分函上海市政府及警備司令部對於令飭本市意圖鼓煽顚覆政府破壞公共秩序之報紙停刋一舉，表示擁護。並請禁止各該報紙之復刋。以後如有同樣紀載之報紙刋物，以圖顚復政府，擾亂社會為目的者，政府應一律予以同樣之處置，以求社會秩序之易於維持。（五）由本會將以上各點，即日電吿代表本市之參政員及居住本市而由國府遴聘之參政員，在國民參政曾中一致主張，以符人民之期望。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全國注視之金潮案，地院曾於上月四日傳被吿中央銀行前業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，及上海市金業公會理事長詹蓮生初審，昨日下午二時，地院復傳林，楊·詹三被吿，由推事汪家焯再度審訊。並傳到證人前金業公會理事長徐補孫，前央行業務局襄理兼出納主任王松濤，及倪祖光·謝秉泉·郞烈錦·股羅發·馮淸庵·陸安如·施和德·張丕鈞等十人。辯護律師有陳霆銳·端木愷·單毓華·兪鍾駱·方福樞等八人。旁聽席上人頭攢動，座無隙地。公案上堆積大小賬簿五紥，約九十餘册。審訊時間自下午二時起至五時止，達三小時之久。末庭諭改期再審，林·楊兩被吿交原保，詹仍還押。</p>
<p>林鳳苞供奉命行事</p>
<p>昨日開庭後，首由害記官馮端翔朗讀上次庭訊筆錄，嗣即個別訊問。第一被告林鳳苞供稱：金磚四百兩一塊，係由美國輸入，經業務局出納課提收後，交同豐餘熔化成條，然後交給央行，再由出納課配售於同豐餘·泰康源·大豐恒·方九霞·楊慶和五家。有時為節省手續起見，泰康源等四家直接向同豐餘領取配售金條，但當日須與央行交割清楚。配售分明配與暗售兩種，明配數目在上午十時許就知道，至暗售數目至晚間六七時結賬時方知。黃金買賣每日均向上面報吿，有庫存表可查。本行稽核處亦經常查賬及查庫存。對庭上詢問黃金買費，何等愼重，為何僅憑收條即交付黃金，不先將傳票做好？林答做傳票是內部手續問題，被吿無權過問，僅係奉貝總裁命令行事。至此，庭上傳證人王松濤訊問，王稱：「配售條係由楊副局長簽字，至晚上五六點鐘才能曉得配售數目，憑金業銀樓業的收據就付金條，這是楊副局長關照的。』</p>
<p>配金帳目相差極鉅</p>
<p>庭上再轉而訊問材鳳苞，以核對央行與同豐餘賬目結果，其中相差甚鉅，即央行賬面數額少，同豐餘賬面數額多。如一月四日相差五十八條，八日四十五條，九日一百十二條，十日一百十五條，十一日廿五條，十四日廿七條，十五日四十五條，十六日四十六條，十七日四十條，十八日八十七條，二十日一百廿條，廿一日一百四十六條，廿二日八十六條，廿三日九十五條，廿四日三百條，廿五日四百七十五條，其故何在？端木愷律師對此，請法院去函央行澈查，即可明眞相。庭上對於央行送來賬簿均係活頁，至為不滿。林亦覺潦草，惟稱央行會計課係由國府主計處派員駐行辦事，彼無權過問。</p>
<p>兩次證言前後不同</p>
<p>嗣傳第二被吿楊安仁供稱：金業與銀樓業的申請與領取均係分開，每日上午成交有一成交單，由金銀兩業理事長將應配的金條領取。旋又傳證人王松濤對質，因王前後二次證言不同，庭上頗為震怒，王迎忙認錯，稱未聽淸楚。庭上仍續訊楊，楊承認每日配金數目是由渠所關照。對於央行送至法院賬簿，稱係草賬，另有正式賬簿（庫存賬）在會計課，此種活頁賬是新式的。　繼傳第三被吿詹蓮生供稱：去年起至今年一月廿七日為止，是由同豐餘代為配售。一月廿七日以後是由央行直接配售，由同豐餘代為熔化。至於一月廿七日賬面上，央行記載一八二〇條，同豐餘僅記載八二〇條，相差一千條的原故，是因上下午關係，來不及交割，故將一千條轉至第二日付款。庭上訊以為何央行一月廿七日賬上記明錢貨收付消楚，詹則支吾其詞。至此，傳證人前金業公會理事長徐補孫證稱：本人於民國十六年起任公會會長，至卅四年勝利後改選，由詹蓮生繼任。去年前央行總裁貝祖貽找我，為配售黃金事請我帮忙，我答以不够資格了，後遂由詹蓮生與林鳳苞楊安仁接洽辦理此事。不是由我介紹的，僅不過貢獻一點意見而已。詹之為人沒有失過信用，其餘則不知道。昨日庭訊至此完畢’各被吿證人簽供後改期再　。</p>

<h3>吳市長調處學潮　被捕學生昨釋放　復旦等校敎授提出意見市長表示贊同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市交大學生，爲請求釋放被捕同學，昨日擬結隊向市政府請願，並先派代表訪吳市長。吳市長得訊後，於中午十二時一刻，親生徐家匯交通大學，聲明被捕學生可由校方或家長領回，至於上海法學院被拘之學生十一人，因有煽動罷工罷市之證據，必須靜候司法辦理，惟允於學生復課後三日內，代向法院及司法行政部交涉，依法律規定如所犯罪嫌在最高本刑爲有期徒刑五年以下者，可設法保釋。</p>
<p>市長允准五點</p>
<p>同時經學生之請求，吳市長即允准五點（一）連日所有被捕學生，於昨日（廿六日）五時前一律釋放。（二）受傷學生，由市府免費診治。（三）非得校方同意，軍警不得擅入學校。（四）學生在校內開會，經校方允許者，不得干涉。（五）嚴懲兇手（但必需有人證物證）。學生方面已允於今日復課。下午五時，吳市長於市府會議室，接見各報社記者，發表前往交大調處學潮情形如上。</p>
<p>敎授意見四點</p>
<p>又：復旦大學法學院院長張志讓，敎授邱漢生，顧仲彝，孫大雨，慮于追，交大敎授孫澤瀛，聖約翰大學敎授沈體蘭，上海法學院敎授焦桐，曁大敎授曹未風等九人，於昨日下午四時袂聯赴市政府訪吳市長，請求釋放各校被捕學生，當時吳市長表示，學生已允復課，被捕學生即可於五時左右釋放。各敎授均認爲滿意，惟向吳市長提出四點意見：（一）囑有關機關，以後各校之糾紛，應由校內解決。（二）地方機關避免過問，非與治安有關，且非經學校當局通知時，不得派軍警前往。（三）學校當局處理學潮，應注重勸導。（四）學生間之爭論，應取講理方法，而不用實力行動。吳市長表示贊同，並請各敎授勸吿學生，遵守諾言，於廿七日復課，各敎授於四時三刻始辭出</p>
<h3>全體學生分別保釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕後送至警備司令部收押之交大，同濟，復旦等校學生九十人，已於昨日陸續由學生家長及校長保釋，至下午六時四十分全部釋離警備司令部。上午由家長保釋者有新建中學學生兩人。下午五時許，交大校長吳保豐由市黨部書記長謝仁釗陪同至警備部，辦理保釋手續，同濟校長董洗凡，及市敎育局副局長李熙謀，亦先後趕至。交大學生初尙不肯出獄，因同被拘押者尙有新建中學學生兩人家長不在滬上，一時無人保釋，故堅持必須一同釋放。旋由吳校長謝書記長等奔走接治，警備部始允全部開釋。六時二十分，學生分兩批魚貫步出看守所，時警備部大門外已有交大及同濟校車各一輛，及同學數十人守候，被捕學生步出大門時，鞭砲大鳴，相互攘臂高呼，旋即登車，於六時四十分駛離警備司令部，沿路並高唱「就是力量」等歌曲。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕交大學生甫告釋離，警備司令部廣塲內又先後駛到警察局紅色警備車二輛，車內係當日江寗分局等逮捕之大同曁大兩校學生數十人，但警備部方面未予收押，由宣司令論知，仍駛回警察局自行處理。</p>
<h3>宣司令發表變話　盼保釋學生不再鬧事</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕警備部宣司令鐵吾，於昨日下午七時接見記者，對「學潮問題」，發表談話，略稱：（一）若干學校學生，因遠反戒嚴法令被捕，經各校校長分別要求保釋，被捕學生共九十人，已於七時前全部釋放同，計交通大學四十人，同濟大學卅九人，復旦大學五人，新建中學六人。各校長請求保釋時，申述此等學生回去後，即可恢復上課。而軍警當局拘捕此等煽動學潮學生之意，亦即希望彼等不再鬧事，回校讀書，故予應允。（二）如果此等學生回去後，學校秩序不能恢復，而且繼續到校外，從事破壞地方秩序之煽動宣傳，則仍將予以拘捕，彼時將不再輕易允准保釋。（三）昨天以前，被捕的學生中，有少數是陰謀的策動者，即係送法院詢辦者，大多數則否。（四）政治的問題很複雜，絕對不是鬧鬧呌呌可以解決的，更不是認識不够，經騐不够的人，所能用一種簡單的方法，立刻使之進步的，如果學生有興趣於政治，應該於此時多多硏究學問，庶幾將來從事政治時，可以認識淸楚，亦可以有更多的貢獻。（五）舉生們喊口號，貼標語，罷課遊行，爲的都是「反內戰」，誰應負內戰的責任，應該先弄淸楚，今天很明顯的事實，是共產黨在作亂，所以政府才戡亂，學生們反內戰，我很佩服，然而他們應該向共產黨（眞正的內戰負責者），去反內戰，才有效。（六）現在陰謀份子，還在準備策動「五卅」及「六二」總罷工，總罷市，總罷課運動，他們的企圖一定失敗，因爲今天上海的任何人，最需要的是安定和一個良好的社會秩序，決不會去同情這些蔭謀份子，來破壞秩序，而且一定表示堅決反對。（七）上海的整個治安，決無問題，必要時將宣佈無形戒嚴。</p>

<h3>平師院學生代表　決來滬轉京請願</h3>
<p>袁禮敦校長勸阻無效</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿六日電〕國立北平師範學院院長袁禮敦，廿五日對記者稱，師範敎育辦理之好壤，不在獨立學院與大學名稱之差別，而在努力辦學與否。據報告：學生要求「復大」者，將派代表五人赴京，向敎育部面述復大之理由，並要求參政會，促請政府實施三十四年該會恢復師大之議決案。本人一再勸阻無效。又該院「復大委員會」選派代表五人，赴京請願，其中三人，二十四日已赴津，餘二人二十五日晨赴津，即乘輪取道上海轉京。</p>
<h3>軍警阻止學生請願隊員頭部受傷流血　當塲逮捕為首學生廿餘人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕曁南，復旦，同濟，音專，及商船專校等校一部份學生約八百餘人，於昨日中午齊集寳山路曁南大學內，擬於午後向市政府請願，要求釋放連日來被捕之各校學生。本市靑年軍二〇二師第二旅，警察總局機動車大隊，及該管北站分局，事前奉命均派員前往該校勸阻學生請願。學生等在校內高唱歌曲呼口號，並有多人立於牆頭或窗前，對勸阻請願之軍警，肆意辱駡。各軍警極力忍耐，僵持至下午六時半，學生男女數十人領首，意欲衝出校門，軍警上前阻攔，未能生效，乃欲和緩情勢，稍向後退之際，校門內學生紛紛以磚塊雜物，對準軍警拋擲，當有稽査隊員王志誠頭部受傷流血，另有趙正啓，林維川，何震球等多人，亦受輕傷，至此軍警忍無可忍，乃將爲首學生葉大培等二十餘人，予以逮捕，轉送警備部訊究。其他學生逃散，或躱入校內寳山路一帶臨時戒嚴，禁止通行，各軍警於十一時撤退。昨晚曁南大學負責人與軍警當局，於新華別墅商討善後問題。</p>
<h3>北洋敎授會　反對平部遷津　說明四點理由</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿六日電〕國立北洋大學北平部敎授會，爲反對平部遷津，經全體會議議決特發表宣言，說明反對理由五點：（一）平部歸併津校，則北平僅淸華北大兩工學院，而天津巳有北洋南開工商河北四工學院，對於大舉平均分佈院系，合理發展原則，似有不合。（二）北平三工院學生，本部佔有百分之四十五强，其現有設備，本部因未受戰事影響，最爲整齊，若以歷史論，亦以本部最悠久，今若全部遷津，不啻將北平歷史最久設備最善人數最多之工院，宣吿結束。（三）去秋各校招考新生，報名人數，津校與平部爲三與廿二之比，即在平部報名者，六倍於津校，可見北平靑年對工科之興味。（四）平部遷津，其圖書儀器及工塲拆卸裝運，即以目前物價估計，已需百餘億元，以此鉅額款項發展工業敎育，或以充實津校，皆有可觀，今僅供遷移之用，似太浪費。（五）工業建設，乃欲使中國成爲現代化國家，至爲重要，原有各工校，自應維護擴充培植，建設幹部，平部併津，直與裁撤一已有歷史基礎之學校無異。</p>
<h3>同濟新生院　仍照常上課</h3>

<h3>民食調配委員會　昨舉行籌備會議　各首長交換意見具體辦法未決定</h3>
<p>吳市長爲使本市民食供應，迅連周密起見，建議於本市設立民食調配委員會，專負本市民食調劇配售事宜。自上週糧食部長來滬，與有關當局磋商後，已定週內成立。昨晨十時，假糧食部上海總倉庫召開籌備會議。出席糧食部龐次長·葉參事·總倉庫葉主任，社會局顧處長·吉科長·中央銀行任秘書等六人，會議至一時始畢。</p>
<p>會後據總倉庫葉主任稱：籌備會中對名稱職權，參加單位，配米數量等項，擬定辦法，須呈行政院張院長核示，今日當可決定。本市配米，總倉庫備有暹邏米供配，白粳及碎米不致搭配，價格外傳係十六萬八千元，惟此項暹邏米，於當地以黑市價格收進，故成本高昂，是否低價出售，有待吳市長·谷部長·張總裁·會商決定云。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日下午，張總裁等復在中行交換意見。入晚，吳市長，吳局長，亦參加商討。據悉：尙未商定具體辦法。糧食部擬將該項民食調配事宜，歸地方政府主持。</p>
<p>食米再漲出四五關</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市因天氣放晴，來貨較多。南北二市塲昨到貸六六九七石六斗。賣戶因產地漲風未戢，持貨扳倘，故市勢續往上挺，較上週六又升起二三萬元。白粳門售價已越四十五萬關，人心頗爲恐慌。</p>
<p>據悉：昨晨十時，無錫米價曾喊至四十四萬元，至中午則暴落至卅八九萬元，此種反常現像，全係底盤不穩之故。社會局畏吳開先昨語記者稱：渠已請糧食部勿再在產區採購，否則鄕村與都市米價皆無法抑平。目前惟有趕速裝運洋米，方能根本解決。</p>
<p>高貨白粳昨南市未有做開，中貨喊四十二萬五千元。北市高貨則做四十二萬二千元。薄稻喊價四十二萬二千至四十三萬元。</p>
<p>食油因內地價漲，以及其他雜糧無不暴升，亦猛烈再挺，創新高價。小簍生油五十八萬元，本廠豆油六十一萬元。</p>
<p>昨麩皮早市狂漲，收市回平，軋漲萬元。豆餅亦猛進疾退，盤漲四五千元。黄豆隨之暴漲萬元，菉豆高貨亦上漲萬元，中下銀起三五千元。赤豆無正式市價，飛奔二三萬元。苞米酒精廠動辦，讀漲萬元。紅糧酒坊亦貪，步挺一萬餘元。生仁洋莊本街互吸，奔騰二三萬元。芝蔴洋莊本街競購，劇漲二萬元。</p>
<p>配米價格昨經核定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕全市工廠學校配米價格，昨日上午由糧食部中信局社會局等有關機關，作最後商討，核定爲這米每石二十四萬元，碎米十六萬八千元。其第一批經社會局審核准予配購者，計學校二百二十單位，工廠一百五十餘單位。社會局定於今日發出通知書，各單位於明日繳款換取提米證，即可向糧食部上海糧食總倉庫提米。</p>
<p>又訊：招商局海辰輪已離加爾各答抵仰光，現正裝載中信局托運之秈米七千噸，一俟裝竣，即兼程返滬。海天輪於五月廿一日抵加爾各答，正裝載物資供應局托運之剩餘物資九千餘噸。又招商局海黄輪昨日由滬啓椗，駛秦皇島葫蘆島，海黔輪定今日由滬駛基隆轉汕頭。</p>
<p>核配洋米十五萬噸</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉世界糧食會議核配我國本年六七八九各月份之糧食，共計有洋米十五萬噸。分担供米區域，屬於六月份者，計緬甸三萬噸，暹羅二萬噸。屬於六七八月份者，美國四萬噸，南美某國一萬噸。屬於七八九月份者，緬甸暹羅共五萬噸。聞緬暹米價，每噸合美金一百元。美國米價，每噸合美金三百元。故估計全部核配糧食之價款，約需美金二千五百萬元。又聞我國刻正擬向美給購食米十萬噸，小麥二十萬噸，亦需價款約美金四千五百萬元。該項國外糧食之處理，聞均係委託中央信託局處理。所需鉅額外匯支出，可望不受限額輸入之支配，將由政府另行設法籌措。現緬暹方面之食米五萬噸，可望望於下月間首先抵滬云。</p>
<h3>麵粉業公會　辦理配售平價粉　每日約可配紛七千包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市平價麵粉之配售，糧食部已有公事送達市府，請中央信託局每星期供應利朋洋粉四萬包（每包七十磅），交由麵粉商業公會恢復配售。粉公會方面本預定於今日起，可恢復配售。惟以社會局公事尙未到會，故勢將延至明日開始配售。此後每週將配售六天，每天約可配大包七千包。聞此次配售對象，將限於製造品各業，包括麵包餅乾，大餅油條，及切麵三業。至酒業及糕糧點心兩業，因認爲係奢侈食品業，將暫停配售。至七十磅洋粉之配售價，依原定議價，廠價每包爲十萬〇五千七百元，另售價每包爲十一萬一千元，並不變更云。</p>
<p>又悉：中樞當局，以本市食用麵粉之市民，亦佔相當成數，正考慮擴充平價麵粉之配售額至每月五十萬小包。此項麵粉，除配售製成品各業外，尙將特約平價公賣店五十家，每日以平價麵粉供應門售，以便嘉惠直接消費者云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨日麵粉市况，以配粉迄未恢復，廠方又多執貨不售，加以米價高翔，價遂飛黄騰達。統粉達九萬三千元，兵船粉達十四萬五千元，大包麩皮八萬一千元，小包麩皮五萬四千元，價均較上週末好起不少云。</p>
<h3>銀根軋緊　布下挫</h3>
<p>昨日紗市客幫以銀根緊信，運銷又未見暢通，是以稍納即停，惟本街染織廠對四二支細紗，微有進意，故喊價得以站穩。做價四二支紗爲一千二百六十萬元，比上日軋升十萬元，但廿支特雙馬則回降五萬元，爲七百廿五萬元，其他各支紗價升降互見。</p>
<p>棉布市况，初開平穩，旋因銀根軋緊，實銷平靜。塲中多頭轉賣不寂，致價下挫。十二磅龍頭細布，因週六紡建挨號全配，籌碼甚充，行情步趨軟弱，最後做價為卅萬元，比上週六軋落一萬元。五福廿八萬四千元，回小一萬一千元，其餘各牌細布及藍布細斜嗶嘰漂布等，則跌多漲少。</p>
<h3>絲調平穏</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲一二〇號高山有光，一千八百萬元開盤，成交一二箱，即吿步升。最大到八百三十萬元，迄收盤喊二十萬元。下午因中信局繼續配售，人心不免稍餒，最後喊八百十萬元賣出。結果比上週六做即期價仍大十萬元，比週六做週一價短去廿萬元。</p>
<p>昨市廠絲稍有動情，做開B字等級二千一百萬元，C字等級成交價二千〇五十萬元，較上週六喊價均大五六十萬元。另祖交易甚少，喊價亦皆提高五十萬元之譜。干經仍無去路，另担價徘徊在一千四百五十萬至五百萬元之間。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨頗平穩，眞絲被面塲內喊價依舊未更，不過並無成交。大誠格子璧縐開市做開三萬一千五百元，最大喊到六七百元，後因賣多於買，即見疲軟。最後爲一千二百元，下午因絲價見高，喊價一千五百元賣出，結果與上週六平，羅紡因產地報大，昨申市做價提高五百元。</p>
<h3>銀樓請願代表返滬　財經兩部允商辦法</h3>
<p>本市銀樓業同業公會，於上週初推舉代表吳彭年等四人晋京請願，要求政府准予各銀樓自由買賣飾金，並請中央銀行配售條塊等情，先後歷十餘日之久，業於昨日返滬。據悉：此次晋京請願代表，包括新疆江西湖南及江浙兩省各地代表等數十餘人，曾分往國府參政會行政院經濟部財政部等機關請願，瀝陳該業困難情形。代表等並謂政府取締黄金買賣，意在抑平物價，實施迄今，已歷三月，惟物價仍然暴漲。政府此舉，徒使全國數十萬賴此爲生之銀樓職工生活瀕於絕　。結果財政經濟兩部允轉呈國府，於最短期內，決定具體改善辦法，當不致使全麗銀樓職工失望。聞如短期內政府仍無改善辦法，將軍度晋京作大規模之精願。</p>
<h3>本年春繭代款　所發僅五百億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中黨公司息：本年度春繭貸款二千億元，迄目前爲止，發放各地繭行之現款，僅及五百億元。而現値春忙時期，單以浙江省言，繭行一日所需款額即常在一百五十億至二百億元之間，故已請示左部長，設法加速發放貸款，並放寬貸額云。</p>
<p>又據中國農民銀行息：春兩貸款中，業已簽具合同之絲廠，刻已達卅九家，貸額約達六百億元云。</p>
<h3>遞交又有新傳說　華股大部起回風</h3>
<p>華股昨永紗忽起回風，棉花。糖，結款爲數頗鉅，且遞交前途，又有新傳說，人心不支。餘股亦感法疲，火柴榮豐中絲美亞大通均吿迫停。臨收前永紗亦吿跌停。但華　搪瓷新股屹立漲停，最爲生動。中國內衣增資完成，亦定今日恢復賣買，單位定一萬股云。</p>
<p>晨開尙堅，遞永紗開高至八〇五〇元，二一八號一〇五號二二三五號八九號三六號七六號一一二號一八六號紛售，聞結款甚巨，銀根必緊，步降至七六三〇元。華豐由一〇七號掛高至漲停，一九〇號一四三號趁低這高一百元。火柴跌停，一一七號一二五號一五四號二二三號賣到七四〇〇元。一五三號一八五號一四二號六一號趁低來進，回升至七五五〇元光景。二二三號六〇號一三三號八三號八五號一〇六號一九九號九九號四八號一六三號一六〇號八九號來售，遞交展期有衹准一月，及增加交易稅等謠言，人心不佳，榮豐美亞大通中絲紛紛跌停降爲七二五〇元。入後稍事掙扎，一五二號三二號曾進至七四〇〇元，一五五號一六二號八三號一八三號一四二號二　號七一號六五號一九〇號二二　號一一七號陸續脫售，臨收時終於跌停。九一號三二號九九號有所維持，收市稍穩。收後九九號仍納而稍昂，喊價迫近七二〇〇元。結果較上週六計華豐獨吿漲停，永紗美亞永公中法新華各跌一成左右，信和新光景福勤興各跌半成强，榮豐火柴跌至限度，大通中絲跌停有回，新亞水泥商務國貨麗安各跌半成至一成不等，統益跌落成半。遞交計永紗跌停後微回，美亞跌停，信和跌一成，永公降一成半，新光景福勤興各降半成强。塲外各老股計五洲升半成，華商南洋大生各跌半成，餘尙平疲。</p>
<h3>統債步降</h3>
<p>公債昨統丙開高至一六〇〇〇元。潤德有納，三六〇室進後即出。自一七〇〇〇元起，逐步下降。散戶爭售，良以幻想不敵現實。銀根緊迫，於是終吿不支而竭。步降至一四〇〇〇元而後稍定。甲乙亦自一一〇〇〇元回落至九千元。成交約五百餘萬。較上週六計丙漲四百元，統鼎平平，甲乙戊各跌二百元。</p>
<h3>外股劉跌</h3>
<p>外股昨洋行幫有納，證券帮雖吿先出後進，但以廣帮責胃仍濃，金市暗盤亦吿回低，怡紗自晨開七五〇〇〇元起，步降至六七〇〇〇元結束。較之上週六計開平電話微降，會德豐業廣鋼業　植跌半成，英聯怡紗紙業怡啤航業各降一成。</p>
<h3>白糖緊青糖平</h3>
<p>昨糖市白糖緊而靑糖平，公會劃盤秘魯砂初爲四十二萬元，旋升四十二萬二千元至六千元，前後升一萬四千元。二〇中砂白三十九萬二千元，升二萬餘元。三半草白四十四萬元，二四粗白四十六萬八千元，升度相仿。汕提靑號方雖呌升，但未成交，回籠貨曾有劃出二十六萬八千元，升三千元。刁靑二百餘包二十四萬元，朱見升色。又數十包二十四萬五千元。石門片靑另星開二十四萬元。興化白高貨升萬餘元，爲三十九萬五千元至三十九萬元。次之三十八萬元，高莊興赤二十九萬元，普通二十七萬五千元，計二百餘簍。</p>
<h3>上等煙煤續升　焦作白煤獨疲</h3>
<p>煤市上等烟煤層，供貨續缺，趨勢再見挺秀，尤以開平一號屑最爲俏俐，喊價已高達一百零五萬元。二號屑基隆屑漲勢較爲緩和，價亦需九十萬外。烟煤塊則隨之微升，低等烟煤屑除鄱樂較呈活躍，豐城等去路依然呆滯。焦作白煤前因到貨中綴，貨主居奇，最高價達二百餘萬元。昨因漢口客帮略有小額運到，行市已吿不支，每噸一百九十萬元有賣戶。然因與其他白煤行市相較，同業仍難出手，故受主頗缺，恐再有下跌可能。</p>
<h3>肥皂火柴挺秀</h3>
<p>日用品市况，肥皂火柴轉吿上升，門莊帮去化頗佳，執貨者居奇扳價。一二〇塊黄祥茂皂週六價在廿五萬九千元，昨市最高喊廿八萬元，嗣以見高有吐，結果爲廿七萬二千元，固本皂最後價爲四十萬零四千元，較星期日續漲一萬四千元。其餘光華亨利及日光皂等價亦一致挺俏。</p>
<p>火柴市面亦呈挺秀，美麗牌新貨最後為二百六十二萬元，軋升二萬元。鳳凰南京老虎等牌大都戰升二三萬至四五萬元不一。</p>
<h3>捲煙下午回疲</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市勢，以烟稅普加三成，廠盤或有盤動，故開市即挺俏，場內同業進取不寂，外埠同行拋貨亦减少，喊個遂吿穩秀。下午塲內聞永泰和有派烟之說，人心遂　疲軟，喊價亦吿平疲。大英牌烟最後價爲六百九十五萬，比上日每箱猛瀉二十四萬元，老刀六百四十五萬五千元，亦小八萬五千元，其二十支裝華商烟價，亦疲軟無神。</p>
<h3>工業原料騰踴</h3>
<p>工業原料，以百物齊升，又以銀根轉鬆，吸購紛起，市况至爲緊俏。燒碱又復回升，因液體燒碱純碱激漲，價與固體並出，市面看好。本來液體燒碱35婆梅每噸與一桶月牌相比，價在七至八浙左右，現以成本加高，已與月牌看齊。松香脚地頗堅，凡士林亦昂挺至甚，三壓美貨司的令，每担已做至三百六十萬元。中法貨每祖二百九十萬，較上年漲達二十倍。</p>
<h3>漢口桐油銳井　滬市突破五關</h3>
<p>漢口桐油市况，昨日下午本市行商接漢口電話，據曾做高至每担四十七萬五千元，較上週五四十萬幾狂騰三成。其原因爲華南桐油走私更具體化，組織化，故該帮競向市上收購，本市下午做價每祖爲五十四萬元，較上午喊升二萬，市况又轉緊俏。</p>
<h3>出口腸衣停頓　祇走私商可獲利</h3>
<p>腸衣輸出，國內成本過高，國外市塲價格仍無起色，亦陷於停頓狀態中。據悉：美國紐約市價，每副二角，每桶二千五百副，折合國幣六百萬，現產區價格，毛腸每副至少二千八百元，每桶約計七百萬，加工料每桶約九百萬以上，故實無法出口。歐洲市價每副爲一先令六便士，每桶約合國幣八百萬元左右，雖比美市塲爲好，但無銷路，目前衹有走私商可獲厚利。</p>
<h3>女色呢平疲</h3>
<p>各種五光十色之光毛女色呢，日來市塲上趨勢，俱見平疲，零躉成交無幾。因廠家產出較充，號方所存亦夥，實銷已達靑黄不接之時，售價已連漲不少買方均抱觀望態度。男色呢羢市况，秋貨花呢類均俏秀，夏令貨已漲至飽和點，人心見懈，買方均欲推銷前進存貨，致躉交續减，市氣有下墜可能。</p>
<h3>荷印新嘉坡　限制僑商滙欵</h3>
<p>僑匯走私曁出口外匯逃避問題，已引起各當局之密切注意。財部現已實施加强僑匯機構，簡化僑匯手續，曁放寬僑匯尺度等三點，以期增加僑匯及出口外匯頭寸。又據金融界透露，南洋有少數地方當局對於僑商匯款來華，常有限制或留難情事，如荷印政府限制每人匯款不得出三百盾，新加坡限制每月匯馬來幣八十五元，政府當局對此種事態，極爲注意，已分向各該國交涉中。</p>
<h3>平衡國際收支　準備改訂稅則</h3>
<p>自厲行許可輸入制度以來，入超雖逐漸减少，當局爲求國際收支平衡起見，更將運用嚴密稅則。財部方面已着手研究，進出口稅決予改訂，其原則爲（一）國內不能製造之工業機器，减免進口稅，（二）國內加工之工業成品推銷國外者，輸入原料或半製品，酌予退稅，（三）對國內供應不足之民生必需品，徵較輕進口稅，（四）進口物品與國內工業有競爭性者，課予重稅，（五）奢侈品寓禁於征，仍課重稅。至出口方面，則以免征或减征方式，以致鼓勵。</p>
<h3>本年華茶銷英　首季較前銳減</h3>
<p>據中國農民銀行發言人談：茶貸方案實施後，湖南及福建二省，已根據該行之規定自行購買毛茶，積極從事生產。祁門之紅茶商亦相繼在收購毛茶中。該行在該三處已貸出十八億元。至屯溪之茶商至今尙未開始從事生產，彼等仍盼政府能貸予鉅額貸款而再收購毛茶，不願自行墊本收購。農行方面對此點已一再表示，國家因整個經濟關係，無法大量貸予，盼各茶商能顧念國家艱難，而加强茶產。祁門本爲我國一主要茶產區，政府在本年度對該產區之企望頗殷。至各地茶產裝箱運滬農民銀行以六十萬一箱之價務收購，再運銷國外，對本年度之茶產外銷，必予加强，據有關方面統計，我國本年度運銷英國之茶葉量數，較前銳减，抗戰前一年首季一月至三月，運銷英國茶葉達一千六百六十三箱，而本年度首季一月至三月運銷英國僅二百八十三箱，前後相差殊鉅，其他各國亦均較前减少，本年度運銷國外，若設政府與人民不共同合作努力，則茶葉外銷之前途岌岌可危。</p>
<h3>押款陳茶先行評價</h3>
<p>上海茶葉輸出業同業公會會員，以去年度所押於中國農民銀行紅綠外銷箱茶計約十萬箱，合六萬擔。在要求政府收購前，爲明瞭其實際輸出究値若干，特開會決議，先請本市辦理茶葉出口洋商怡和，協和，永興各洋行代表，及著名茶葉專家李蔚靑，卓禧伯，盧家茂三人，先爲評級評價，簽具意見後，再呈請當局，以資有所根據。茲悉，已上六代表，已於昨日上午十時半逕赴福煦路中國茶葉聯營公司，先將全部茶樣，作初步標準資格之決定，今天起開始分別評價工作，預料賡續兩星期，方克吿竣云。</p>
<h3>杉木堅穏</h3>
<p>杉木因水脚漲價，又聞產地因裝船工資加價太鉅，閩莊有一致停裝消息，致滬市脚地頗穩。</p>
<h3>酒市狂騰</h3>
<p>近日紹酒，蘇酒，漲達五成，前途潛勢頗堅，燒酒漲風尤烈，較前月漲達一倍半。</p>

<h3>茶春時節在皖西</h3>
<p>— 合肥十二日快訊　本報記者寶白萍</p>
<p>記者此次巡遊皖西，正是最美麗的茶季，過了六安以西，春山如笑，遍山遍野，是一塊塊的茶園。鎭市，鄕村，山野，所有的人們，忙的是茶，談的是茶，買賣的是茶，肩挑車運的也是茶。一年茶春的好壞，對於整個皖西農村經濟，是有莫大的關係。</p>
<p>六安·立煌·岳西·霍山·舒城·都是皖西產茶之區，進入茶區，便是重重的山峯，據說山頭越高，够得着雲霧籠罩，又是烏沙土壤，則出產的茶，它的色·香·味·都能合上最高的評價，像六安齊頭山的瓜片，在「六安茶」中幾乎成了珍品，這在茶的典籍裏也可看到，六安州志載有黄曉「水晶菴記」，曾說「水晶菴在齊頭山下，疊嶂重蔭，溪聲如吼，山頂高二十里，出雲霧茶，六之異產。」齊頭山在麻埠東南十五里，記者在麻埠時，聽說現在的齊頭山上茶，最上品的茶只有幾棵，那是道地的雲霧茶，今年老早就有幾個帶槍的人在上面守候着採茶，雲霧茶確是不待品題，已是身價十倍了。</p>
<p>產茶地區，分爲「外山」·「內山」·「東山」·「西山」，所謂「外山」，是山頭低，黃泥土，茶的品質較差；「內山」是山頭高，烏沙土，茶的品質好些。如霍山的大化坪·諸佛庵·甘棠均·立煌的麻埠·流波　·古碑冲·稱爲「內山區」；霍山的東流河·淸潭溝·洛陽河·立煌的船板冲·八里灘·龔店·稱爲「外山區」。至於「東山」「西山」，是按地勢分的，自渒河霍山以東，呌做「東山」，以西呌做「西山」。就茶的品質說，「東山」不如「西山」。</p>
<p>云冬天賽　今春雨稀　產量少</p>
<p>靠山吃山，山岳地帶普通作物栽培不易，農民們便多賴茶葉收穫，換取糧食布疋，維持生活。</p>
<p>皖西茶的產量，在民國二十年以前，最多時年產一百萬簍（每簍十斤），不幸得很，民國二十年茶產中心地霍山立煌等縣，爲共軍盤據，茶葉產銷因而脫節，內山茶園，荒蕪很多，二十四年共軍敗退後，還未趕及恢復，二十六年抗戰軍興，茶區被日本軍隊封鎖了，於是產銷停滯，山價奇低，茶農所得，不敷成本，這一來，茶園遭遇到厄運，茶農們放棄茶園的經營，有些把茶樹剷掉，改種雜糧。據霍山茶葉改良塲三十一年調査估計，皖西茶產總量不過四十萬六千餘簍，比之民國廿年前，减少二分之一强，這筆慘巨的損失，茶農們該向誰討還呢？</p>
<p>茶產以六安最多，霍山次之，立煌又次之，岳西舒城最少，現將霍山茶葉改良塲二十七年和三十一年的統計列成下表：</p>
<p>（二十七年）</p>
<p>六安　二十三萬七千簍</p>
<p>霍山　二十萬簍</p>
<p>立焊　十萬二千簍</p>
<p>舒城　十萬簍</p>
<p>岳西　一萬七千簍</p>
<p>（三十一年）</p>
<p>六安　十六萬零九簍</p>
<p>霍山　十三萬六百簍</p>
<p>立煌　十二萬一百簍</p>
<p>舒城　二萬六百簍</p>
<p>岳西　一萬二千簍</p>
<p>勝利後皖西茶產並未增多，今年產量雖尙沒有數字，但一個茶農吿訴記者，茶山冬天凍不得，春天雨水缺不得，而去年冬天比前年冷，今年春雨比去年少，茶葉絕不會比去年出產多。如此，縱然和去年產量相等，也不過四五十萬簍，如何復興皖西茶園，如何增加皖西茶產，記者認爲這是皖西農村經濟一個重大的課題。我們不能把它看做是農民的副業而忽視它，假定今年茶產是五十萬簍，照記者在麻埠時的茶價，每斤一萬二千元計算，則總値有六百萬萬元，這筆錢對於皖西六十萬茶農是有相當價値的。</p>
<p>熱鬧部門　茶行之晨　揀茶葉</p>
<p>記者在獨山·麻埠·閒步街頭，不隔幾家便會看到一個茶行。茶行的設備是除了比較漂亮的房子外，還有許多揀茶的桌凳，烘茶的大小茶籃，土炕，秤篷子等等東西。</p>
<p>茶農或茶販子把茶葉送到茶行，除掉買賣手讀外，製茶的過程是：（一）摘茶草。（二）炒成潮茶。（三）烘成乾茶。（呌做拉火，一交火，二交火，拉老火）（四）揀茶（把老葉子老桿子除掉）。（五）裝簍（簍子用竹編成，里面舖放養葉和園竹葉，每個簍子，剛好裝進十斤凈茶。）</p>
<p>揀茶是茶行裏最熱鬧的一部門。淸晨，剛見陽光的時候，總是婦女佔絕對多數，老的，少的，都向茶行集中。</p>
<p>桌子上滿堆着乾茶，她們把老葉子老桿子揀出來，放在一個碗裏，揀過的乾茶便放進靠在桌邊的茶籃中。</p>
<p>她們坐了一天的板凳，所得工資也不過二三千元，還要回到自己家裏吃飯，這種勞力出售，算是最便宜了。</p>
<p>交通受阻　內銷困難　茶農苦</p>
<p>據熟悉茶的情形者吿訴記者：皖西茶葉一直是內銷的，在明代就已運銷華北，直至關外。淸未，霍山的「霧眉尖」，曾進貢到皇帝御前的。民國初年，不僅遠銷華北，也銷至蘇浙，只因皖西茶的製法與裝簍，墨守舊法，不知改良，原有蘇浙市塲，遂被浙江茶取而代之。卅年來，除掉在本省銷售外，大槪都是運銷山東，最遠則達到天津</p>
<p>戰前，六安的茶由淠河水運至蚌埠轉津浦路北上，至山東，每簍運費八角錢。立煌的茶水陸兩路都在正陽關集中，到蚌埠轉山東，每簍運費一元五角。霍山的茶也由淠河運蚌轉津浦路，每簍運費也是一元五角。岳西的茶從霍山石稽上　，到正陽關經蚌北運，每簍運費一元七角。舒城的茶從三口河運到浦口到山東，每簍運費八角。</p>
<p>抗戰當中，津浦路斷絕了，茶運停滯了一個很長時期。到廿九年，由六安，正陽，阜陽，原牆集，亳縣，歸德，到濟南。這條路運輸很困難，但利之所在，茶商們不惜冒險，聽說那時候獲利在一倍以上。</p>
<p>到今天，運輸更困難了，共軍的拿手好戲，就是破壞交通，戰前和戰時的那兩條路都不通，皖西的茶連內銷也無路可銷了！</p>
<p>今山東茶客，就極少有到皖西的，因此茶價低落。去年茶春時，茶農一斤茶可費得三千元，換來二斗米，今年此時，雖是茶價高至一萬元以上，但換不到一斗米，這是使茶農的生活更壓低了，爲茶農生活着想，爲皖西茶葉打開銷路着想，更爲恢復國內交通着想，記者希望津浦路能早日全綫暢通！</p>

<h3>香港洋行行界　買辦制度　宣告廢除</h3>
<p>— 香港十日航訊　本報特約記者子健</p>
<p>本港各大洋行和銀行，大半已廢除數十年來根深蒂固的買辦制度。洋行中，如太古，法甸，天祥，銀行中如匯豐，渣打，萬國，寳通，大通等，都已先後取消買辦制度。原有買辦制度下的辦房人員，現已不再自成體系而改爲受僱於洋行或銀行中的職員，買辦本人，則改稱經理或高級職員。這不能不說是香港的十里洋塲中的一個大革命！</p>
<p>香港的環境好像一個萬華鏡，我們要從許多角度去看牠，萬不能拿一面而槪括其餘。聯合社駐華主任漢浦森，由上海來香港後，對人說：由上海到香港，好像「監獄期滿出獄」。這句話不出奇，出奇的是漢淸森本人「出獄」了幾天，又自願回到「監獄」去！香港不需要無聊的歌頌，也不需要惡意的批評，却需要眞實的了解，那就對中英雙方都有禆益。</p>
<h3>臺灣的報和紙　百尺竿頭進一步</h3>
<p>— 臺北七日航訊　本報駐臺記者楊育</p>
<p>二，二八的暴風雨猛烈地拂吹過去了，台省新聞界遭到了空前未有的厄運，許多報紙的生命完　了。其他報紙，在事變的冲擊下，也顯得精疲力盡，沒有錢，沒有紙，再也沒法支持，於是停的停，關的關，最後盛極而衰的又循環到只剩下了中華新生兩家報紙。雖然現在的台省報壇有些靜極思動的樣子，可是直覺地使人知道的困難只是一個字！紙，解決了紙，就解決了一切。</p>
<p>機械設備遠東稀有</p>
<p>紙的生產與配銷在本省究竟是一種什麽狀况？紙業公司總經理謝惠博士給了記者如下一個答案。</p>
<p>台灣紙業，過去有着二十餘家大小造紙工廠，在規模，生產力以及機械設備各方面說，是一個在東亞很有地位的工業，年產紙張在十萬噸以上，日本有了台灣，單從文化角度言，確得到極大的帮助。光復後，就分別按照了工廠的性質，把這二十幾個單位分爲民營，省營與國省合營，國省合營的規模最大，在台灣紙業公司之下，一共有五個工廠。</p>
<p>台北廠在羅東區，原係台灣興業株式會社，設備新頴，有二部闊達一二〇吋的造紙機，三隻似七層樓高，可容十五噸原料的蒸煮鍋，多是東亞造紙界稀有的機械，戰爭中受損很大，接收後化費了所有的精力在機械廠房的修理上現在十之八九已經修竣，僅水泥一項就用去了四千多噸。這裏出品以印刷用紙爲主，其他有台道林，鈔票紙，香烟紙等，三月份產量達二八五公噸。紙廠最緊要的工具如銅絲布，毛布，已到了山窮水盡之境，還好得最近已買到一批美國貨，有了這些生力軍，台北紙廠很可能達日產五十噸的預定目標。</p>
<p>改製漿機造臺道林</p>
<p>臺北廠士林分廠，原係臺東製紙株式會社，專製各種硬紙板，如屋頂板，白紙板，黄紙板，火車票等，原料稻草不虞缺乏，每月產量在四百噸左右，已超過了日本時代，銷路很好，所以工廠雖小，但對公司的經濟却大有帮助。</p>
<p>台灣紙漿工業株式會社，現改爲台中紙廠，以往完全生產蔗渣紙漿，每日產量有五十噸，但目下蔗渣不易取得，停工又未免辜負了機械的能率，因此就將紙漿機改成了一部八十二吋寬的製紙機，拿竹，香水草，鬼萱草等作原料，專製水泥公司的紙袋，專賣局的香烟壳以及五十磅的台道林。三月份雖衹生產了一五〇噸的紙張，但事實上却還能爲公司增加收益。</p>
<p>原名東亞製紙工業株式會社的高雄廠，受轟炸損害最巨。民國三十三年年終建廠元成，每天生產牛皮紙與水泥袋在十噸左右，但接收後一直停頓，直至目前才算修整了一下，上月二十五日試車成績尙佳，預定本月十日就可以正式開工，但產量比以前總要打上一個七折。</p>
<p>臺北紙廠棋錯一着</p>
<p>在五個工廠中，最有希望的要算是台南廠了。在鹽水港紙漿工業株式會社時代，這裏每天有近一百噸的蔗渣紙漿生產。規模宏偉，可說是中國最大的一個紙漿工廠，內部設備就是和美國相比擬也並無遜色。因爲經費的不足，直到去年年底才開始修理被毁的廠房機械。上月廿五日與高雄廠同時試車，成績美滿，現定五月十五日開工，以三年前的蔗渣存貨作原料，預計每日可產紙漿三十噸。</p>
<p>謝總經理吿訴記者，所有台灣的製紙工廠廠基，多不合式，在遝輸上，原料的供應上以及接近市塲的幾點上說，多不是最新式，最科學化的地位，但他也指出它的原因，例如台北紙廠建在偏僻的羅東，當初日本人是計劃利用廠址附近山上的鬼萱草作製紙原料，質地極佳，只可惜日本人發現到這種草要兩年才能收割一次的時候，已經嫌遲了，最後不得已由總督府撥了花蓮港的林田山管理所來供應這裏的原料，才算渡過難關。</p>
<p>外銷初步希望無窮</p>
<p>買到了銅布，總算爲紙廠解決了一個最傷腦筋的問題，但是原料問題却成了紙廠一個新的困擾。台灣的木材雖多，可是大部份却是建築用村，製作紙張的木材，迄今還沒有一個不斷供應的來源。退而求其次，竹·蔗渣果能大量補充，似乎在目前還不會受到原料的威脅。</p>
<p>記業公司出品，過去完全在省內行銷，新聞紙一項，也完全通過了公署紙張配給委員會，實施配給，可是能够獲得這種權利的，也僅限台灣書店印刷課本與中華新生兩個報紙而已。目下捲筒紙的配給價每磅台幣四十八元，還打八折，比起上海的黑市價格要差得多，但在增產沒有能達到供應裕如的地步，　　制是無法取消的．最近紙業公司已將一百噸的台道林開始向上海試銷，這是台省紙張外銷的第一聲，我們希望它能獲得良好的反響。而更盼望與文化事業的配合上，紙業州公司再盡一分最大的努力，使得本省的文化事業能在百尺　頭，更進一步！</p>

<h3>論現階段我國保險業</h3>
<p>— 烏通元</p>
<p>晚近本市火災頻仍，吾人除積極方面應儘量改善防火設備外，更宜在消極方面向保險公司投保，以取得生命財產之保障，故於此時此地而就目前之保險業作一撿討，或亦有其價値。</p>
<p>夫保險之意義乃在分散個人或團體因不可避免或可能　生之災害而遭受之額外損失，此種額外損失由參加保險之個或團體共同負担之。現行辦法即以保險業爲媒介，而由各被保險人按時繳納一定之保險費，於災害發生時取得一定　補價，使其不致遭受意外打擊而致正常工作無法進行。故保險人不但在消極方面可保障個人或團體不致遭受意外打擊，積極方面更能集合大衆力量設法改善環境使災害之可能性逐漸减少，故其本身不僅爲一盈利事業而已，更具有服務人羣安定社會秩序之功能。晚近各國頗多以各種保險爲主要之社會政策而以法律強制推行者，於此足見保險事業之重要。我國保險事業雖已初具規模，但尙未爲社會各階層所認識，故如何配合當前經濟狀况，使保險業能爲社會各界人士服務，實有於保險業務上作一理論或實務上之檢討之必要。</p>
<p>吾人先就賠款而論，賠款行被保險人因災害之發生而遭受物質上之損失於保險人處取得的一種補償。此種損失之補要按理應能彌補所有被保險人物質上損害爲原原，但根據現行法則，賠款之計算根據投保時保險金額，結果在物價動盪時期，幣値跌落之損失全部由被保險人負祖，不但有失公平且亦違反保險之原意！試以火險爲例：假定根據歷年來之統計，堆存非危險品之頭等建築倉庫。每年之平均失火次數爲千分之四，故當時保險公會規定此種倉庫之保險費率爲千分之五，使保險費收入扣除賠款後亦有適當業務上收入，今假定有麵粉一千萬包，每包値價一萬元，平均分貯於一千家頭等建築之倉庫內，當時每家會庫投保麵粉火險國幣一億元，共納保險費國幣五億元，亦即一次預付保險費麵粉五萬包，其中一萬包爲保險人手續費，四萬包用作賠款之用。假定在此一年，物價高漲一倍，麵粉由每包一萬元漲達二萬元，在此時期被保險人因四家倉庫失火災毁麵粉四萬包，結果因保額僅四億元，使賠款所得僅能購回麵粉二萬包，無形中犧性麵粉二萬包。反之保險人取得五萬包保險費後，因投資營運價値不變，除去一萬包麵粉需爲開支盈餘外，其他四萬包麵粉作爲賠款之用，結果因幣値變動，僅需賠出麵粉二萬包，遵致意外盈餘麵粉二萬包，假定幣値跌落愈多則被保險人之損失愈大而保險人之不勞而獲愈多，或云在物價變動期間，被保險人可隨時提高平價，辦理加保手續，但實際上被保險人已預付一年保險費，此加保之保險費即爲其幣値跌落時之損失。即以壽險而論，不論其死之壽險或生存年金，其性質一似定期存款，不但壽險金之總値遠不如按時繳納之壽險費，且使保險原意全部喪失，蓋區區壽險金生不足以娛晚年，死不足以殮逝者，如此而欲發展壽險業務實無異緣木求魚。故賠款實爲當前保險業之主要中心，其措置能否得當可影響保險業之命運。近年來中信壽險處舉辦之指數壽險即用以糾正此種弊端，但亦僅限於人壽保險一端而已。根據同樣辦法產物保險亦應効法指數壽險以賠償實物爲原則，否則亦應根據重置價値（Rsplacement　valne）計算賠款金額。不過保險人是否有此種能力担負實物賠款亦値得吾人考慮，譬如所保產物其價格上漲程度超過物價指數，或因資金出路狹仄所得盈餘額不足抵償幣値之跌落，結果使五萬包麵粉之保險費僅餘四萬餘包，除去四萬包實物賠款後，餘數不足以爲業務上開支之用。自亦非保險業所能接受。不過根據現行辦法，全部幣値跌落之損失由被保險人負担，亦失之不公，折衷之道可採行分期繳納保險費辦法，藉以减輕被保險人之損失而不致使保險人有不勞而獲之嫌疑。其辦法如一年期保單之保險費，可分四期支付，若幣値變動甚大，可分十二期支付，若被保險人願一次繳納，可按照市塲利率根據年金現値法改按幾折實付，若中途發生賠款，未繳納之保險費可於賠款金內抵扣，此法雙方均能兼顧，當可爲保險當局作一參考。</p>
<p>次就保險費率而論，保險費率之釐訂其性質一似普通工商業規定商品之售價，合理正確之費率可使被保險人支付最低額保險費而保險人可取得相當的營業利潤。否則過高過低均有不及以致影響正當業務之推動。理論上之保險費率應根據各種災害發生之機率（Probatulity）加以業務上之開支及盈餘等因素而構成，故保險費率應根據各種統計資料始可求其正確，例如人壽保險之根據某一城市各種年齡之死亡率等；但此種費率非一成不變者，諸如因科學上之新成就，或各種環境之改善，均可使减少然害之發生，例如經過科學家不斷的研究改良，BCG能在醫藥上普遍使用，結果結核病患者大量减少，以致减低大都市之人口死亡率，如此則壽險費亦應相對减少，其性質一似工廠因實施科學管理而致產量激增成本减少而使售價降低一樣，但此種資料仍需依據日常之統計，故欲健全保險業務，必需舉辦各種統計工作以　得科學上之依據。就理論而言，統計數字根據之年代愈久或搜集之資料愈多則機誤（Probableerror）愈小，而所得之結論亦最爲正確，但在物價彼動期間，此種統計工作頗難進行，因每一時期之貨幣價値不同，以不同幣値之絕對數並列計算，其正確性殊令人懷疑，尤在幣値加速度跌落期間，後一階段所佔之權數（Weight）甚大，換言之此種結論完全根據最近幾月之數字而來，其機誤之大自不待言。此種弊端並非無可補救，吾人可以根據物價指數消除幣値跌落之因素，誠然此種繁瑣工作自非少數保險公司所能勝任，但可集合同業力量助成此舉，使保險業務能配合每一時代社會經濟環境以健全保險事業之基礎！</p>
<p>在物價波動期間，保險業自有其得天獨厚之處。假定業務不變。保險業之收入可隨時追隨物價指數，因保險費與投保額成一定比例，而保額隨時根據物價指數升降，故保險費收入亦與物價指數成比例　，而不必如其他各　因幣値之跌落需隨時調整其售價。故如何在此一時期力求改善以奠定保險業之基礎，實爲保險業最切要之課題。</p>

<h3>我最後的擊念</h3>
<p>— 菲列賓　李薩爾作　高朗譯</p>
<p>別了，我敬愛的國家；被太陽所愛的地方；東方海洋的眞珠；我們失落的依甸園！我快慰地獻給你我悲慘的生命，它曾經是多麽光明，多麽快樂，又是那麽壯健，為了你的緣故，我願意把生命奉獻給你。</p>
<p>沒有猶豫，也沒有遺憾的人們，在戰塲上瘋狂地戰鬥，將他們的生命奉獻給你，可是四週是些甚麽東西！是他們的松柏，月桂樹還是水他花，斷頭臺還是廣大的民族，反抗還是殘酷的殉難，反正，這全是一樣，當時是為了挽救國家和家庭。</p>
<p>當我死的時候，從那被黑色覆蓋的耶穌隆臨節那天，注視着飛翻的天空的宣言。它正需要紫色為它的黎明着色，這兒是我的鮮血；我快樂地為它傾流，只要它能够鍍上新生的光芒。</p>
<p>我的幻夢只不過是個孩子，當時是充滿活力的靑年，永遠地看望着你，東方海洋的珠寳，你黑色的眼睛乾了，你抬起了愉快的面孔，和你淸白無瑕的榮耀。</p>
<p>我生命的幻夢啊！我狂熱的憂慮啊！向我即將離別的靈魂呼呌，哦，歡呼！為了獻給你的前程這是光榮的死亡；為了獻給你的生命去死亡；在你的天空下死亡；在你慈愛的胸懷裏永久地眠躺。</p>
<p>多少日子以後，你將在我的墳墓上發現一朶孤獨低卑的花朶，感　在環密的葉子間，把它放在你的唇邊，吻着我的靈魂。讓我感覺到我的前額在淸凉的墓碑下和你和暖親切的呼吸。</p>
<p>讓溫柔寂靜的月光注視着我；讓黎明展開它燦爛的光輝；讓風兒悲嘆它莊重的怨語。讓烏兒飛下在我的十字架上休息，讓牠在上面宣佈和平的歌曲。</p>
<p>讓燒灼的太陽把露水融化，從我歌曲音符的空白處普照。讓友愛的人們悲痛我的夭折，在寗靜的黃昏作祈禱，哦，親愛的國，家啊！你也得同樣為我向上帝祈　。</p>
<p>為所有那些無名的犧牲者祈禱；為了他們遭受不平等的痛苦；為了我們憂愁困貧的母親們；為了寡婦們和孤兒們；為了受酷刑的罪犯；也為你自己可能獲得最後的贖身而祈禱。</p>
<p>當黑夜的陰影籠罩着墓地的時候，瞧着那些孤單單遺留的死者，並沒有擾亂地們的安息，也沒有擾亂他們的神秘。你們得師聽一種琴弦的音調，這就是我，深愛的國家呵，我為你而歌唱。</p>
<p>當我的墳墓全被遺忘了的時候，連十字架和石碑的標記都沒有，讓農夫在它的土墩上撒播；而我的屍灰在沒有化盡之前將成為你土地上的塵埃。</p>
<p>以後，假使你拋棄了我，遺忘了我，我也並不介意。我會從你的空氣間，空擋，山谷行過。我將在你的耳膜際響起一種震動，淸　的音符；芬芳，色澤，語言，歌曲，一聲嘆息，永恒重複我忠信的要素。</p>
<p>我崇拜的國家，我憂愁的憂愁喲！我敬愛的菲列賓！聽我最復的吿別。我離開了所有的他們和你；我的父老們和愛人們。我所　的地方沒有奴隸，沒有暴君，沒有　子手；那邊是忠信不是死亡；那邊是上帝統治的地方。</p>
<p>別了，父老們，弟兄們，我劃戲的　汾！失去家園的幼年的　好們，感謝你們，從那疲勞的日子我要安息了。別了，親善的異鄕人，我的朋友，我的愉快，別了，我所愛的人物。死亡就是安息。</p>

<h3>奧園的低潮</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>維也納紙張雖然缺乏，各種期刊却仍出版。各　封面的刋物，使人不知道買什　　。音樂，戲劇，文學，政治，時式，各種刋物不知道有多少。戰後奧國電影工業雖只出過一部電影，但電影刋物却出版了十本左右。</p>
<p>報紙上連載長篇小說，作家們盡量避免「戰爭」「法西斯蒂主議」「政治」等詞。他們寗取史特勞斯（JohannStrauss）舒適的日子和「愉快的舊日維也納」為背景。「說故事者」（Storyteller）週刋上每期所登的長篇連載，總有一段謀殺或通姦。低級的無意識，這是維也納小說的特徵，被民主的人們稱為「油煎小雞文學」（Brathuhn-iterature），因為這是訴之於胃，而不是訴之於心或頭腦的。</p>
<p>最近法西斯蒂阻止維也納學生的生長，奧國的民主派把宣傳的標語貼滿了全城。牆上　着一個希特勒式的兵—一個靑年只有屍首的空眼睚。上面寫着：「母親們，為反對那些要你們的孩子們學像他們的人而戰，」</p>
<p>這就是反對法西斯蒂的宣傳畫。現在，自然，他們是躱起來了，但他們被壓迫的，死滅的影響仍存於奧國的生活之中，他們的影子也掠過文學的上面。</p>
<p>維也納的法庭現在正審問着法西斯蒂作家吉路西克（Jeluslc）。下面坐着一個沒有表情的方驗。過去，吉路西克是「連路」（Anschluss）有力的支持者，並且是急進派的宣　者．他的小說把歷史加油加　地添上戀愛，該撒寫得活像希特勒。</p>
<p>無疑地，這人腐蝕了靑年的靈魂，也是國家的恥辱，但法官却想讓這位汚穢的客人復職。一位維也納的敎授對他的學生說：「不幸吉路西克的作品現在不能重新出版，但有一天歷史會判斷在這爭論中誰是對的。」</p>
<p>奧國的法西斯蒂現在不能公開地宣傳他們的思想。但他們總想盡力拉回沿着民主路上走去的奧國人民。</p>
<p>這是一個殘廢的世紀。十個兒童中，九個不知道托爾斯綦，傑克倫敦或羅曼羅蘭，甚至不知道李德（MoyneReid）或考貝（Fenimore　Cooper）。凡從民主國家來的作品都被禁止。從狄更司到馬克吐溫的兒童文學都被卡爾梅（Karl　May）無窮無盡的小說所代響，他是頒　德　殖民的。</p>
<p>書市上充滿了油煎小雞的文學，這意　不僅是商業的。人們現在不能公開地出版納粹文學，只好出些神秘故事和犯罪故事。他們希望這種精神食糧能防止危臉思想。他們對於普通犯罪感到興趣，就不再勞神於希特勒派的罪惡了。</p>
<p>美國犯罪影片也大量湧來。法國一九四〇年的秋季沙龍帶給維也納的仍舊是畢邊索，　蒂斯那些舊人。其中淡有一張法國人抵　德國血淚　　。除了由本和　　裝　以外，什麽也看不到。那些畫彷彿隨便畫在什麽時候都可以。</p>
<p>維也納大學有一個女生想研究左拉，也被禁止。據說左拉是德萊扶斯案件的支持者，他反對牧師，便是過激。許多名著，如莎士比亞，托爾斯泰，哥德，海湼，釋勒和哥郭里的作品，曾由一家書局出版過一套「永久的語言」（Evige　Wort），這樣的書書也被禁止了。</p>
<p>奧國也有頗有思想的作家，但這樣的作家實在太少了。下面且舉兩個人為例：</p>
<p>左科爾（Frank　Tsokor）最近寫了一首劇詩，名呌凱來潑梭（Calypso）。在希特勒時代，他移居到達爾瑪蒂亞（Dalmatia）。他用奧德賽古代神話來表現他的思想，說明詩人對於國家的責任。這是一種眞誠的工作，思想是時代的。但却少人注意，只有」層智識階級受點影響。他之受人漠視，是現代奧國普遍的現象。在法西斯蒂統治的年代，只有破壞天才的文化建造者。阪賣齷齪的商人如吉路西克，布了一個厚網，統制着整個奧國的精神生活。他們直到現在，仍舊恨天才和進步的一切。</p>
<p>白萊契斯特因耐爾（Bleichsteiner）在德國佔領時，不願編高加索辭典，以為希特勒軍隊之用。他被趕出大學，甚至現在他還不能任敎授之職。他是法西斯蒂的敵人，會經譯過不少蘇聯作家的作品。這就足够使得奧國人反對他了。白氏很不高興地說：「我非常愛我的國家，但今天這樣的氣氛，來研究文學是困難的。」他說得不錯。法西斯蒂主義在奧國雖已隱藏，但並不曾放下它的武器。在奧國，發展忠實的民主藝術和誠實的通俗文學，情形仍舊是十分困難的。</p>
<h3>「灼若芙藻出　波」</h3>
<p>— 進珊</p>
<h3>英遊偶炎</h3>
<p>— 胡叔異</p>
<p>我一到英倫，就想參觀聞名世界的大學城——牛津大學和劍橋大學。這種急切的情緒，彷彿像酒漢魯子深下了山，別的都沒見到，遠遠地早已望着「酒」字旗高掛的村莊，一樣地有興趣，有精神。何况正是中秋時期，我們選定這中國獨有的富有詩意的佳節，去遊名城；不能說是沒計劃的遊歷。我記得在一九四五年秋天的一個晚上，我們旅寓在倫敦一家公寓裏的幾位黃臉外賓，發現了，證實了後天就是中秋佳節。W兄提議，為什麼不到江南景色的劍橋去玩一次呢？於是馬上電話通知幾位同來的遊伴，約定明天乘上午第一班火車配定頓（Poddinton）地道車站集合，我們一行五人，堯師年齡最高，在旅途中詩興勃發與瑞兄唱和甚樂，承緒兄客英倫多年，當然是最合格的嚮導，臨時要我做會計，我就提議「不記帳的會計」的辦法，就是先請各位遊伴預付若干英鎊，我把它集中在一只鈔袋裏，算是「公用錢袋」，以後旅途一切開支，都在公用錢袋內取用，我每天晚上，把公用錢袋所有的錢檢點一下，發現不足，隨時請各位遊伴補充，每天如此連續下去，直到旅行完畢為止，再掏出公用錢袋裏剩下來的錢，平均發還。他們說我旅行不忘訓練，這是集團生活中的「信用」，相當Smart。其實我怕瑣層記賬，也可說是貪懶。</p>
<p>牛津大學在太晤士河上游的牛津市。有大學獨立學院三十餘個，每學院均有獨立之組織，各有敎室，宿舍，及偉大之敎室。我們去參觀那天，正是星期日，所以全市充滿了敎堂的鐘聲。各學院均有學院私路至牛津河。河邊都有小碼頭以供掉艇，而綠楊垂柳，風景之佳一如我國之西子湖濱。劍橋大學，有獨立學院二十餘，分佈於劍橋市，市橫跨在劍河的上面，所有橋樑與校舍，都是古色古香，各學院也都有通至劍河小碼頭的院路，被綠油地草地，擁抱着，不獨做了學生唯一的天然運動塲，實在是學術研究必要的自然環境，至於風景之秀麗，嫵媚，和牛津大學沒有分別，正可以互相輝映！</p>
<p>在倫敦很少見楊柳在小橋流水中縣蕩着，唯有牛津劍橋二個大學區的草地上，無數的垂楊，與一條細長的河流，深深地懷抱了一片油綠的草地，形成了男女靑年藏修息遊的理想環境。我們參觀了二大學的研究院，知道他們不採用美國的學分制，注重人格陶冶，先生的指導與發生的學習。都在個別的接觸與談話中進行，學生開始一種學術硏究，經常在各位敎授的談話中陸續計劃，逐步改進。因此學生的個性和人格，都給敎授洞燭無遺，如何推進學生的硏究一問題，必須在人格陶治過程中解決。這是牛津劍橋大學的特點，至於大學敎授，各學系都有定額，正敎授不出缺，副敎授永不能升為正敎授，很有若干鬚髪已白的老敎師，學術硏究已斐聲國內外，而名義上仍舊是講師或是副教授。就因為正敎授沒有出缺的綠故。我們在倫敦住上了二個多月，覺得大都會生活的煩擾，這次短短幾天的牛津劍橋之遊，因為牠擁有垂楊綠柳，芳草如茵，我們在這詩情畫意，晴雨相宜的環境裏，大家詩興勃發，瑞兄口占有：</p>
<p>「雨過長堤草色鮮，西風猶喜柳如烟，一聲款乃數行鷺，吩咐波光勿問年」。</p>
<p>讀了至今為之神往，世界馳名的大學城富有江南景色，所以能吸引着成千萬的靑年學子！</p>
<h3>流水</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>路途漫長，伴的是寂寞。</p>
<p>一塊石，一顆草，也許激起了漩渦，濺起了泡沬，但是，趕路呀，趕悠遠的生命的道路呀，漩渦滅了，泡沫隱了，是一條無垠的路，沒有盡，也沒有誰知道。</p>
<p>流水也許會　給你智慧，因為它希望你去啓發生命的謎底。</p>
<p>生命永遠是匆忙，也許詩人在頌讚，也許畫家在描繪，但是，誰又能知道它蘊積的憤怒？你看，嘩啦，流水怒了，流水笑了，雖然，它依然不能留戀這美的風景，依然得匆匆的去趕路。</p>
<p>沒有目標，也沒有好惡，只是隨着自然的力，努力的奔波，宇宙中，有此這更枯躁單調的生活麼？我也為流水憤怒，我也為流水不平；然而，除了同情，又何處去寄無窮無盡的話語？</p>
<p>流水，你終會有一天雄偉　起來，你的歷史就是無比的絢爛！流水！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血519</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「我們中國歷古以來，是個文化禮義之邦；就只可惜了一點　眞正的文化集團份子，老是被一些專制魔王，用盡了各種卑鄙手段，儘量摧殘，屈壓，呌他們無法進展；把整個的民族，為了他們一已之私，弄得腐化不堪。自從通了海禁以來，又被外來的壓力不斷地打擊着，以致沿着些西洋文化皮毛的，看不起我國舊有文化，頭腦舊些的，又說這羣毛頭小夥子，太洋化了，因而不肯改變自己的思想。這就是中國現階段的情形……</p>
<p>「然而中國民族人種的本質，畢竟並不像東西洋人宣傳的那般低劣；目前僅僅是站在新舊的交叉點上，徬徨躊踟，一時把國有的丟了，而新的又沒把眞的精髓抓住。然而也用不着悲觀；只要一下拔到了一條大道，進步起來，必定很快，必定可以很快地走到前頭，來領導這個時代。我們百忍莊的團體雖小，現在就是抱定了這個宗旨，看準了這個方向走着」。</p>
<p>『您身邊好像沒帶傢伙。」鶴見側過臉去，瞧着守一。</p>
<p>「我不大喜歡用那東西，除非事態過分嚴重，……」守一把住舵盤，注意路綫，笑着回答。</p>
<p>「萬一嚴重起來，臨時需要，又怎麽辦？』鶴見好奇地追問着。</p>
<p>「萬一嚴重，必是對方人多，傢伙也多；假如需要的話，我可以問他們借來一用了。」</p>
<p>『他們，』</p>
<p>『對方。』守一解釋着。</p>
<p>『冒着飛彈去搶？』鶴見回想到小老虎和子　奪槍的兩幕。</p>
<p>『不一定那麽拼命…』</p>
<p>『我認為總是很危險的事…練過中國拳術的高手，固然手疾眼快；可是，萬一碰到對方身手敏捷，射擊準確，雙方又隔相當距離，恐怕沒有那麼容易說話哪。』鶴見因想到虎城和子珊兩次套槍，都是表演性質，實地對敵，結果恐怕沒有那樣美滿。</p>
<p>『練過和沒有練過的人，動作的方式和速度，差得太遠。從練過的人眼中，看沒有練過的人舉動，就像平常人看科學影片裏的『减速遝動』一般…慢得難受。』</p>
<p>『萬一對方也是練過的，同時又是射擊的能手呢？』鶴見仍舊有些不信任。</p>
<p>『練過的人，程度高了，都不大喜歡帶武器；尤其是手槍一類的東西。敝莊現在都守着這條『道德，』就是奪到武器，除非對方是一個萬惡不赦的傢伙，也難得用武器傷人。』</p>
<h3>夜曲</h3>
<p>— 湯匡瀛</p>
<p>寂寞</p>
<p>酣酒倒入苦杯，茂草生於荒田，人們都用一串太息惋惜着它的遭遇。</p>
<p>一枝水仙花生在枯涸的小池邊，臨風招展，一個詩人漠然地走過他身前，停留在一株小桃樹下，用十分憐惜的心情，小心地折着一枝回去，把他供在書桌上的瓶膽中，他為了這小桃吟了很多悱惻的詩篇。</p>
<p>不久，小桃枯萎了，他又被那主人用憐借的心情丟在道路邊；回顧那小池邊的水仙，依然臨風招展。</p>
<p>誰說甜酒倒入苦杯足以惋惜，茂草生於荒田是寂寞。</p>
<p>夜雨</p>
<p>又是夜雨。</p>
<p>雨聲略停，不知誰在低聲的唱着悽惋的歌曲；望到窗外去，黑一片，不容你有一點寄託。</p>
<p>聽歌的人和唱歌的人，都透過枯索而寂寞的情懷，被夜雨惱着失眠了。</p>

<h3>英雄崇拜慾</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>—兼論慕尼黑人大發「希特勒財」—</p>
<p>但，明天，又誰來檢拾一個間沉重的故事呢？</p>
<p>西洋某哲學人說：「在侍僕面前，沒有英雄人物。」這話的含意是：侍僕和主人間的距離太小，主人在外而儘管氣熖囂張，不可一世，回到家裏，不免仍有頽然神傷，甚至對秋風而探淚的時候。有時。正人君子也不免在婢女面前顯出醜態，忘却了日間的岸然道貌了。也有時，一個慣以華麗的衣飾來裝扮自己的英雄，當脫去衣服，由侍僕服侍着沐浴之際，就不免顯出精瘦的形相，而失去了華麗的掩蔽。波蘭顯克微支筆下的羅馬皇帝尼羅，日本小說家筆下的拿破侖，在侍僕面前都顯得相當尷尬，這決不是文學家的幻想，而是可能有的事實。自然，唯有表裏如一的大哲人，大英雄，才不致以虛飾來掩護他的弱點。</p>
<p>果戈里在「死魂靈」中寫乞乞科夫攬鏡自照，做出種種嘴臉，以欣賞自已的「媚態」。這就是一節極妙的寫眞。從　匙孔里去看乞乞科夫的私生活，較之從大宴會中看乞乞科夫的像煞有介事的舉止，更能了解他的個性。鑰匙孔，是果戈里制服某種英雄人物的秘密武器，是他的偉大發明，其威力在善於裝腔作勢的「英雄」看來，也許不下於原子彈吧</p>
<p>英雄和凡人之間，有着相當遠的距離，由於這距離，就使一般人對英雄不易看得眞切。英國卡萊爾說：「英雄崇拜慾也是　類的蠻性的遺留。」這誠然是　針見血之談，可是我覺得還有補充的必要。英雄崇拜慾愈旺盛的民族，在我想來，也許是奴性最深的民族。一般人的知識水準不高，對自身沒有信心，或者慣於用幻想來安慰他自己，於是只好寄希望於神與英雄。歷史上有不少偉人，都被史家們塗抹了一臉的彩色，原因即在於史家們要想滿足他們自己的幻想，聊以自欺欺人。</p>
<p>說來奇怪，大英雄固然受人崇拜，元兇巨愁，也一樣為人們所另眼看待。正如所說，在一般人眼里，成則為王，敗則為寇，本無所謂善惡是非，只要「大」就好，正負在所不計。最近慕尼黑人的大發希特勒財，就是一個實例。</p>
<p>據聯合社報導，希特勒發跡處之慕尼黑，最近出現了不少偽造遺物，黑市中可以找到「希特勤親自應用之烟斗及其手錶。」最近至少有烟斗二十四隻和手錶九隻，被人願以每隻一千馬克之高價收買？美國人對希特勒似有極大興趣，時常胡亂購買，事實上，「殊不知希特勒生前從不抽烟，亦不愛手錶也。」</p>
<p>這還不够顯然麼？空間的距離加上時間的距離，使許多人對希特勒不免「另眼相看」，所以雖然是納粹魔王，但他畢竟殘殺了，數千萬無辜者，也就偉大得頗有價値了。這種英雄崇拜慾一作崇，美國人的荷包日淺，猶是小事；使一般人對納粹的暴行另作估價，甚至以為希特勒不失為一個「失敗了的英雄」，鼓勵德國靑年學他的榜樣，則其流毒就非常可怕了、</p>
<h3>禮物的「請專業課」</h3>
<p>— 山口</p>
<p>有一個愛爾蘭人邀請他的朋友參加他結婚周年紀念，他吿訴他的朋友如何在公寓內找到他所住的房間。他說：「到第七層，當你看見那一扇門上有D字字母的時候，就用你的肘部推動電鈕。當門開的時候，再用脚把它推開。」</p>
<p>「為甚麽要用我的肘和脚呢？」他朋友不解地問。</p>
<p>「啊，天哪！」這愛爾蘭人呌着說：「你當然是不會空着手來的，是不是？」</p>
<h3>撤樂在杭州</h3>
<p>— 𣏌人</p>
<p>杭州自二十一日起，所有娛樂塲所一律停業，因僑西湖影戲院兩次被軍人搗毁，美琪金城兩戲院亦先後被打，有的是損失慘重不能復業，有的也覺得營業太無保障，不願海開門了。同業為表示聲援起見，連京戲，越劇雜劇都一律停業。每家娛樂塲所門口寫着「遵奉同業公議自即日起一律停業」的牌子供着。</p>
<p>這事態眞是十分嚴重，記得在前淸時代，凡是一律撒樂的地方，這是表示地方上有降重的大喪禮在進行着，人民表示哀悼。否則，為什麼全市如樂塲所一律停止如樂呢？</p>
<p>偶得俚句二章，以為停止娛樂的杭州誌哀。</p>
<p>「戲院家家盡閉門，長街短巷議紛紛。</p>
<p>士兵一打安天下，撤樂沉哀欲斷魂。</p>
<p>如樂商人相對愁，西湖歌舞一時休。打風驅得閒人散，看戲如今不自由。」</p>
<h3>齊桓公的離婚</h3>
<p>— 心耳</p>
<p>俗語說：「夫妻吵架尋開心」，沒有什麼大不了的。夫妻之間，應該是尋尋開心，甚至吵架也算是尋開心的一種。論。然而天下事也不能一概而</p>
<p>韓非子說：</p>
<p>「蔡女為桓公妻。桓公與之乘舟，夫人蕩舟，桓公大懼，禁之不止，怒而出之。乃且復召之，因復更嫁之。桓公大怒，將伐蔡，仲父諫曰：夫寢席之戲，不足以伐人之國，功業不可冀也，請無以此為稽也」。</p>
<p>本來是太太尋丈夫開心，結果弄得離婚，其至要向她的娘家開火了。幸虧管仲勸住。說伐蔡以老婆尋開心為藉口，實在是不大高雅的。</p>
<p>由此可見戰端之啓，即是「寢席之戲」也可以造成。歷史上的戰爭，解釋起來，固有其原則上的必然性，可是諸如比類起因，橫起臉來就不認親，則是頗為有趣的。</p>
<p>韓非子寫得好，上節所引的短文中，寫桓公「大懼」，「怒而出之」，繼又「大怒」，層層次次，其態可掬。描出春秋一覇的活嘴臉。</p>
<p>這故事表現桓公與祭女都有些心理變態，以現在的術語來說，蔡女大約是有一點性變態的虐待狂成份，而桓公則神經質的支配慾，他的尊感國和權威感略受挫折，便要發怒了。</p>
<p>描寫這兩種性格都不很容易，藝術作品中見得少，有一篇舊俄小說，描寫一個性變態虐待狂的男人，在雪地裏呌一個妓女脫裸全身，痛加緶打，自然也付給她錢。後者以查理，卓別林描　希特勒，把握得最為獨到。</p>
<p>我常想：希特勒或墨沙里尼，對蒲羣衆圓睜雙眼，聳出了下巴演說時候的神情，總不至用於對付他的情婦吧。因為這是「人性」，觀齊桓公，就頗覺不能一槪而論了。然而這大約也是人性。</p>
<h3>怕洋人的故事</h3>
<p>— 雲間</p>
<p>前淸清光庚子之後，由排外一變而媚外。洋人敎會之勢，炙手可熱，該有「百姓怕官，官怕洋人」之謠。雲間耿公達，有機警，時任雲南迤西道，屬縣有莠民仗敎勢，强佔人田畝。縣府均不敢決，耿自鞫訊，而莠民有恃無恐，語侵官長，耿怒，將其收押。翌日，神父來函。語袒莠民，請保釋。耿復升堂，提莠民，示以神父函，拍案大駡曰：爾挾神父勢，余官可不做，爾不能不辦。乃將神父函，撕作片片舞，莠民仍還押。明晨神父乘肩輿夾署。請見，神父怒不可遏，大聲謂耿曰，余請保釋某敎民，旣不准，何又撕余函？此係侮辱。加無適當辦法，當轉呈領事嚴重交涉，耿乃曰：神父坐，何怒為？某敎民奸刁可恨，平日欺侮良民，無惡不作，即貴神父函，准否權操在我，何必撕函？余作官多年，安有為此輕舉妄動之事，復出神父原函示之。且曰，該敎民不特欺官應，並欺神父。使神父淸晨勞駕，深為不安，該敎民是不可不嚴　也。神父以為然乎？神父語塞，連聲唯唯。自該莠民嚴懲後，敎民均不敢橫行。實則耿所撕者，非神父函，乃實鼎耳</p>
<h3>美國平民　法律扶助會</h3>
<p>— 仁圻</p>
<p>報載：本市律師公會將組織一「平民法律扶助委員會」，為平民代理出庭或辯趣云云。按此種組織，在中國尙屬創舉，而在美國支加哥七年前即已設立，成績斐然。</p>
<p>一般人民，美國亦無例外，發生法律糾紛時，總是糊裏糊塗，聽任事勢發展，非至嚴重不可收拾，不願請敎律師。因為他們一方面不懂聘請律師的手續，另一方而又担心費用太巨，差不多有四分之三數的事務，都未取得法律忠吿而就加以解決，其中當然有許多人要蒙受損失。支加哥幾位熟心公益的律師有鑒於此，乃計劃組織一顧問律師會，請支加哥律師公會加以贊助，其目的在使需要法律顧問之平民，付極少費用，便能得到一位合格律師來受理他的案子。該會設幹事一人，常川駐會，為人解決問題或是介紹律師，其事務所經常擁擠不堪，每日總有四五十人登門求助，幹事本人即為律師，多數輸問由渠一言即吿解決，無需另外請敎其他律師，此種服務，並不收費，如遇需要律師承辦者，由該幹事就登記之律師中指定一位，當事人只須付談話費美金三元，即可與其商談一切；如　需其他服務，收費亦極低廉。該會有三百位律師登記，內中包括支加哥數位有名之大律師，他們按各人的專門知識分別承辦普通民事訴訟，刑事訴訟，賦稅訴訟次及勞工訴訟等。</p>
<p>自該會在支加哥成立後，費城，洛杉磯，星星那提，紐約等地相繼設立，預料不久將有全國性的組織成立。</p>
<p>有人杞人憂天，以為這種便利，將會養成人民好訟的習慣，但就支加哥的情形而論，這種顧慮，純屬多餘，求助的人數只需要一些勸吿和常識，根據了這些知識，他們可以避免法律訴訟的麻煩，而為非作歹的人，也可因人民法律知識的增進而歛跡，因此筆者衷心希望本市行將成立的一平民法律扶助委員會一也能盡量帮助平民，主持正義，喊少人民之損失，發揮律師　高之效能，則平民幸甚，社會幸甚，（本文取材自美國人雜誌芷月號）</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>

<p>打一堆刼灰裏緩緩地爬起了一個拱肩縮北的老人，從相距二三十碼之外，用一條頭抖的手，指定着老祝，他民的兩眼發直，一步一步的跫過來，腳底下顯得乏力，身子老是搖晃晃的。</p>
<p>無目的底咀咒竟引來了意外的麻煩，這倒使老祝覺得有一些　，並且十分詫</p>
<p>「不，老先生，我不是駡你！」</p>
<p>「啊！是小林嗎？是的！是你！」走近了，老祝才看出這個人並不老，只因臉上滿塗了塵汚，鬚髮篷亂，而精神又特別的衰菠，所以遠看就像個老人了。他的眼睛不僅發直，而且釭筋密佈，像喝醉了　一樣；他似乎沒有聽見老祝對他所作的解釋，突然變換了一種語調，同時張開　手，脚步跟蹌地直撲過來。</p>
<p>這時候，祝兆年已看淸楚他是一個　子了，可是並不害怕，仍然向他上上下下的打量着，因此他又發現這個人所穿的衣服，現在雖是這樣的骯　不潔，但它們的質料却全是最上等的，一雙沒有結好的黃皮鞋，　然還是上海的式樣。</p>
<p>「小林！你要金子嗎？說啊！說啊！一那瘋子漸漸地走近了，兩手同時抓住了老祝的肩膀，用力搖撼着。「別呑呑吐吐的，我知道，你們要的就是金子！」</p>
<p>「先生，你醒一醒！我不是小林，你先醒一醒！」祝兆年輕輕地移開了他的手，一面提高聲音向他喊，但和顏悅色的一些沒有生氣的樣子。，</p>
<p>那個瘋子忽然笑起來了，但笑得是那麽的慘，使老祝不忍卒視。</p>
<p>「小林，你是生氣了！是不是？」他用力拍着老祝的肩膀說：「不錯，是我對不起你！你問我借一兩金子我都不肯。然而，小林，我吿訴你！」他忽然壓低聲音，顯出了極機密的神氣。「金子眞是好東西，我們的身家性命都得靠它來保持；鈔票是不中用的，換了刺代就一文不鎭。金子可不一樣，亮晶晶的，沉甸甸的，中國人來値錢，東洋人來也値錢！哈哈哈！」接着他又狂笑起來。「有金子就可以逃命！對不對？小林。」</p>
<p>「那末，先生，你不是已逃到金城江了嗎？」老祝本不忍調侃他，但終於忍不住提出了這個反問。</p>

<h3>Passing of Peace Proposal at the Council; Submitted to Full Review Committee for Discussion; Preparing Telegram to Urge CCP Representatives to Come to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Zhang Qun is scheduled to invite Zhang Bojun, Chu Fucheng, Zhang Nanxian, and Xu Deheng on the evening of the 27th to discuss how to proceed with the peace plan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The biggest theme of this session of the Political Consultative Council, the appeal for peace, was proposed at 6:20 PM on the 26th during the 11th meeting of the Council. The entire atmosphere was invigorated, and the councilors vied to speak, creating the most enthusiastic scene since the opening of the conference. The one who brought up this issue was Xiao Yishan with an ad hoc emergency motion. The motion had as many as 99 co-signers. He proposed three measures: (1) Immediately hold a full review committee to discuss the peace issue; (2) Organize a special committee to formulate a concrete plan; (3) The Council should telegraph the CCP councilors to come to Beijing to attend and jointly plan national affairs. These measures were passed by the Council, and it was decided to hold a full review committee on the morning of the 28th to submit them for discussion. After Chairman Lin Hu announced the motion, Xiao immediately went forward to speak, explaining in detail. He said that since telegrams to the CCP councilors could not be sent out, they could use radio broadcasting. Regarding the proposal to telegraph the CCP and the peace issue, Secretary-General of the Council Shao Lizi immediately reported that a total of eighteen items had been received, plus the ad hoc motion proposed by Kong Geng and others received today, making a total of nineteen items. The presidium had already decided to submit all the above cases to the full review committee for review. The introduction of this issue obviously aroused the attention of the councilors. The councilors who stood up to speak included Kong Geng, Sha Yankai, Luo Mengzhou, Wang Chongping, Jiang Hengyuan, Wu Zhaoxu, etc., all of whom believed that it was necessary to submit it for discussion quickly. After the chairman asked if there were any objections, the motion was successfully passed. As for the telegram to the CCP, the chairman also announced that the secretariat would draft it and submit it for approval at the 12th meeting on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>The full text of the ad hoc emergency motion proposed by Xiao Yishan and others is as follows:</p>
<p>Peace is the unanimous demand of the people of the country and also the policy repeatedly announced by the government. This Council, as the highest organ of public opinion, cannot ignore this major issue that concerns the fate of the country. Since the assembly, colleagues have discussed and various parties have appealed, and the atmosphere has permeated the whole country. Peace and war are still on a knife edge. Although judging from past facts, the future is not optimistic, we know that it cannot be done, but doing it should be the final direction of this Council's efforts. Now that the session is limited, empty talk is of no help. We propose to hold a full review meeting quickly, discuss it in detail, and then ask the presidium to nominate several people to organize a special committee to formulate a concrete plan to facilitate progress, and immediately telegraph the CCP councilors to come to Beijing to attend and jointly plan national affairs, put down arms, in order to save the nation from crisis.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] More than forty councilors, including Kong Geng, proposed an ad hoc motion at the 11th meeting of the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 26th, which was decided to be submitted to the full review committee for review. The full text is as follows: "It is proposed to use the name of the Council to send a telegram to the Chinese Communist Party, asking it to quickly send representatives and propose a plan to restore peace, come to Beijing immediately, and conduct negotiations with the groups organized by this Council; then if they willingly endanger the Republic of China, the Council should send a telegram to the whole country, appealing to the government to issue a clear order to suppress them, in order to maintain the lives of the people and consolidate national unity. (Reason) After eight years of war against Japan, the country's vitality has been greatly damaged. After the victory, we should jointly plan the construction of the country. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party has started wars and caused chaos, and smoke of gunpowder is everywhere. The people suffer unspeakably. Although the government has negotiated with them several times, no agreement has been reached. As a result, the suffering of the people has deepened, and the financial crisis has become more serious. The people of the whole country are looking forward to peace as they are looking forward to a good harvest. If the CCP is willing to have peace, railway traffic will be restored, and the government will reiterate its determination to resolve the CCP issue through political means. I believe that the highest organ of public opinion in the country should represent the people of the whole country and send a telegram to the CCP, asking it to immediately send responsible representatives and propose a plan to restore peace, come to Beijing immediately, and conduct negotiations with this Council to restore peace throughout the country, save the people from fire and water, and consolidate the unity of the country. (Measures) (1) The Council shall resolve to use the name of the Council to send a telegram to the CCP, asking it to quickly send representatives and propose a plan to restore peace, come to Beijing immediately, and conduct negotiations with this Council. (2) The Council shall nominate representatives to organize a national body to negotiate with the Communist Party. After an agreement is reached, they will then negotiate with the government to make a decision. (3) If the Communist Party still has no intention of repenting and refuses to send representatives and propose a plan to restore peace, it is willingly destroying the Republic of China and harming the country and the people. The responsibility shall be borne by the Communist Party, and the Council shall send a telegram to the whole country, appealing to the government to issue a clear order to suppress them."</p>

<h3>Reporting Stage is About to be Completed; Council to Review Proposals Tomorrow; Internal Affairs and Water Conservancy Reported at Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Fourth Session of the Third Political Consultative Council has been open for seven days, and the reporting stage of the conference is about to be completed. As of the afternoon of the 26th, only the land administration, health, economy, Resources Commission, and post-war relief have not yet been submitted. At the 11th meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, Song Yishan and others proposed an ad hoc motion, saying that the land administration and health ministries had not been established for a long time, and the work of the land administration and health ministries had been included in the written work report of the Executive Yuan. To save time at the conference, it was changed to be held in the review committee, which was passed by the conference. The conference on the 27th will be a report on the economy, the Resources Commission, and post-war relief. It is expected that it can be completed on that day, and the review of proposals will begin on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Political Consultative Council held its 11th meeting at 3:30 PM on the 26th. 197 councilors attended, and Lin Hu chaired. Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng made a report on internal affairs and answered questions. After Zhang finished answering the questions, he rested and discussed five ad hoc motions proposed by Xiao Yishan, Kong Geng, Song Yishan, and Jin Zhenyu.</p>
<h3>Minister of Education Continues to Answer Oral Questions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The 10th meeting of the Political Consultative Council was held at 9:20 AM on the 26th. 204 councilors attended, and Li Huang chaired. Twelve people continued to raise oral questions on the education report until 10:30 AM. Then, Minister Zhu answered, lasting for an hour, and the chairman announced a break. The meeting continued at 11:15 AM, and Minister of Water Conservancy Xue Dubi reported on water conservancy work, which ended at 12:25 PM. Then, 20 written questions were read, and four people, including Xue Mingjian, spoke orally. Because the time was too late, the remaining oral questions were changed to written questions. At the same time, Xue's answer was also changed to a written answer, and the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The questions raised by Zhang Qiyun and 12 others on the education report at the 10th meeting of the Political Consultative Council still focused on the student movement. Zhang Qiyun believes that peace, prices, and the student movement are all related, and hopes to jointly review these three issues, seek a conclusion, and then pass it through the State Council and have the government implement it. Huang Yuren believes that part of the cause of the student movement is due to the instigation of bad elements, but most students are dissatisfied with the status quo and the corruption of the government. Wang Huamin pointed out that most of the publicly funded students established by the Ministry of Education are in schools in Beijing and Shanghai, and many of these students are from wealthy families. On the contrary, there is no public funding for homeless and exiled youth in the Northeast, which is unfair. Han Chunxuan said that Northeast youth who have received 14 years of enslaved education cannot settle down and study after returning to the embrace of the motherland. He asked the Ministry of Education to thoroughly investigate the funding for the restoration of education in the Northeast. Yu Ruzhou appealed for the difficulty of Northeast students learning English, and at the same time pointed out that the funding for border education is too small, and border education should be universal. Li Peiguo said that there are more than 7,000 elementary schools and more than 20 middle schools in Rehe, and there is not a single national one. After the questions were completed, Minister Zhu began to answer at 10:35 AM. Zhu first expressed his regret over the student movement, and then explained the various issues separately: (1) The system of general examinations and final examinations. The general examination has been held since 1933 and has never been interrupted, except for one suspension in 1945 and another suspension in 1946 due to the relocation of the school. It will be resumed this year, but it has been decided to suspend it for another year this year. The final examination was previously handled by each school at its discretion. Last year, some schools did not handle it, and it is still handled at the discretion of each school this year, emphasizing "discretion". (2) The issue of separate schools for men and women. This system was decided at the first National Education Conference in 1928, and this year only reaffirmed the previous order, and was not specifically proposed. Some councilors have proposed that female teachers should be the principal of elementary schools in principle, and this Ministry plans to establish more women's normal schools. (3) The issue of relocating Yingshi University. The Ministry of Education seriously considered that it was decided at the 1935 Education Restoration Conference and agreed by the school to establish JinHua. (4) As for Jiaotong University, the name change is actually a misunderstanding, because the Nanyang University in northern and southern China had a glorious record in the history of Chinese education, and the Nanyang University was the predecessor of Jiaotong University. I mentioned this matter occasionally in my speech, but the name of Jiaotong University has been used for more than ten years, so it is still used as the name of Jiaotong University without changing it. Regarding the nautical and marine engineering departments, nautical science was established during the Guangxu years. At the end of the Guangxu years, the Shanghai Wusong Merchant Marine School was established, so the original nautical science students were transferred to the Merchant Marine School. After graduating from the merchant school, Jiaotong University no longer had a nautical department. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the merchant marine school was destroyed, and the Ministry of Education reopened it in Chongqing. However, the school had several disturbances and was suspended. Its remaining students were entrusted by the Ministry of Education to Jiaotong University for management. As a result, Jiaotong University requested to restore the nautical department, and the Ministry of Education approved the new students to be transferred to the Merchant Marine School because the two departments had been allocated to the Merchant Marine School. However, Jiaotong University is now requesting to restore the nautical department and has caused a student movement. It is unreasonable to establish a marine engineering department in the College of Engineering, but it was approved because the school requested it. (5) Zhongzheng University was established during the war, and its equipment was difficult and the treatment of professors was low, which caused a disturbance. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to go to the school to solve the disturbance together with the principal. (6) The renaming of Hunan University to Yuelu University was approved by the educational community in Hunan Province, and the chairman of Hunan Province, Wang Dongyuan, also hoped that it could be renamed as soon as possible. The Ministry of Education had the intention of renaming it, but it has not been decided. It is still Hunan University. (7) Regarding the Hubei Normal College, the principal was unwilling to return to the college to handle matters because the address was not determined and the funding for restoration was too small, which caused a problem. (8) As for the restoration of Beiping Normal University, according to the school, the Normal University is a school with a history. After the war, it was moved to Xi'an and merged into the Northwest Associated University. After the restoration, because there were only two colleges of liberal arts, it was restored to Beiping Normal College and could not be called a university. In the future, it will be established as a complete university. (9) The Tianjin Institute of Technology and Commerce wants to establish a liberal arts department, and the Ministry of Education feels that "industry and commerce" cannot establish a liberal arts department. The college also requested to be changed to a university, and the Ministry of Education believes that the procedures for changing to a university should be handled. (10) The funding for education is too small, and we are trying to find ways to solve it. The issue of publicly funded students is too broad. (11) The atmosphere of the student movement. Most of the students are indeed pure elements. The government's order this time is a measure to deal with public security issues in general. Zhu's answer lasted for an hour, and he finished at 11:35 AM.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Scheduled to Invite Political Councilors to Dinner</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to invite Kuomintang political councilors to dinner on the evening of the 27th and all political councilors on the evening of the 28th.</p>
<h3>Internal Affairs Report and Questions; Political Councilors Request to Clarify Official Corruption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng made a report on internal affairs at the 11th meeting of the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 26th and answered questions. Zhang's report gave a detailed explanation of the various businesses under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, such as local administration, local autonomy, elections, police administration, and prohibition of smoking. When he talked about the revision of the Publication Law, he said that as of noon today, the Ministry has not received any reports on the suspension of publication of the Shanghai Wenhui, United, and Xinmin newspapers, and he will definitely investigate it in the future. Recently, news published in some newspapers does not conform to the facts, which has disrupted social order. The government should take measures to maintain social order, but there are many difficulties in handling it. We hope that the newspapers can put their remarks on the right track, so the Publication Law has been revised and can be sent to the Legislative Yuan. The excessively strict restrictions in the past have been relaxed.</p>
<p>After the secretariat read 21 questions, oral questions began, and the speakers focused on rectifying official corruption. Ma Chengfeng said that a major defect in China's current politics is the centralization of power, with all power concentrated in the central government, forming a situation in which local governments have no ability, and the provincial government is only a transfer mechanism. Regarding the preparatory work for the general election, Ma believes that before the country has not been peacefully unified, universal suffrage is difficult to proceed if the actual military situation is not taken into account. Shen Zhijing pointed out that the work of the public security police is not easy to do well, and at the same time pointed out the corruption of officialdom in Qiongya, with the "Ten Killings" rules, which made people have no way to survive. Fan Chengshu put forward four points: there are too many agencies, too much employment, too vague laws and regulations, and too heavy burdens on the people. He asked the Ministry of Interior to pay attention. Pan Chaoying also pointed out that there are too many donations and taxes in Hainan Island, and the people are unable to make a living, and bandits are forcing land. He asked the Ministry of Interior to pay attention. Jiang Hengyuan pointed out that attention should be paid to protecting human rights to comfort the people. Chen Yiyun pointed out the shortcomings of grassroots politics, and the captain of the security team in Moxian County, eastern Guangdong, is a proven traitor and no one dares to interfere with his wrongdoing. He asked Minister Zhang to deal with it severely. Chen Gengya believes that the qualifications of candidates should be strictly investigated in the election issue, and newspapers that publish false news should be dealt with according to law and notified with a warning. Lu Qian first talked about the change of social atmosphere, believing that there is a need to investigate the responsibility of superiors. Secondly, he asked for an explanation of the social elite. Finally, he believes that the term of office of the provincial and county governors and the funding for local autonomy should be agreed upon. Zhu Yiqing said that the election issue was almost handled by the police in the past, and he hopes that improvements can be made in the future. Luo Heng pointed out that the number of women should be specified in the elections of people's institutions at all levels, and women's occupations should be guaranteed. Regarding the issue of official corruption, if the corrupt are not prosecuted, official corruption cannot be rectified.</p>
<p>Zhang answered the oral questions on the spot. Regarding the issue of rectifying official corruption, he said that he would definitely deal with the local problems that were reported. After Zhang finished speaking, Jin Zhenyu raised questions about the number of seats for the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Zhang replied that he had no decision-making power.</p>
<h3>Water Conservancy Questions</h3>
<p>Emphasizing the Yellow River Blocking Project</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] After the water conservancy report at the Political Consultative Council on the morning of the 26th, the Secretariat read more than 20 written questions submitted by Yao Tingfang, Wu Zhimei, and other political councilors. Then, Xue Mingjian, Ma Jingchang, and other political councilors made oral questions. The most frequently asked question was about blocking and restoring the dikes. They all believed that although the Yellow River blocking project has been completed, the Yellow River has returned to its old course. The project of restoring the dikes in the lower reaches of the Yellow River should be accelerated, and dredging work must be carried out at the same time. If it is delayed, the large flood will come and create a new flooded area. It is especially necessary to cooperate with the Chinese team to protect the project, rush to prevent the Communist army from sabotage. Regarding the personnel and experts who have contributed to the blocking this time, they believe that the government should use them as much as possible, and should not discard them after use. Secondly, the more important issue in the inquiry is that agricultural water conservancy throughout the country should be accelerated. As for Taiwan, it was originally a grain-producing area. During the Japanese control period, it paid attention to water conservancy. In the future, there are new water conservancy plans for further improvement. The increased food production in the province will be even more considerable, and the mainland can also receive the effect of regulation. Zhao Gonglu also proposed the suggestion of maintaining soil and water and cultivating water sources. Ma Jingchang hoped to adjust the water conservancy institutions and that special personnel should be responsible. For example, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the Huai River Guidance Commission, etc. should be changed to engineering bureaus, which are solely responsible for construction. The administrative design of the two departments is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Water Conservancy. After the political councilors finished asking questions, because it was too late, the chairman asked Minister Xue to give written answers.</p>

<h3>Xu Xiaoyan's Proposal to Relax Newspaper Quotas</h3>

<h3>Zuo Shunsheng Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>Negotiating the Collection of Silk Cocoons and Purchase of American Fertilizer; Ministry of Agriculture Proceeds with Discussions</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister of Agriculture Zuo Shunsheng completed his official business in Shanghai and took the express train to Beijing last night. Before his departure, Zuo stated that he enjoyed his inspection in Shanghai very much and that all units of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Shanghai were working very diligently. However, due to the limited time, he did not have time to inspect some undertakings. If time permits, he will come to Shanghai again next Friday or Saturday. In addition to the general inspection, there are two major issues that need to be resolved immediately: one is the purchase of silk cocoons, and the other is the purchase of American fertilizer. Regarding the former, he has discussed with Ge Jingzhong, Li Shuming, and others, and because of the recent rise in rice prices, the original loan of 20 million yuan is considered insufficient and is planned to be increased to 30 million yuan, and it is planned to be purchased quickly to avoid losses to farmers; as for the purchase of American fertilizer, the total purchase requires more than 40 million US dollars. As far as our country is concerned, this amount is not needed. He has already sent a telegram to Chairman Wei of Taiwan Province to determine the purchase quantity based on Taiwan's needs. In addition, Minister Zuo also met with Mr. Clifflai, the new director of the UNRRA China Office, yesterday and exchanged views extensively. Mr. Clifflai expressed deep concern about the full utilization of UNRRA's agricultural materials shipped to China.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Zuo Shunsheng, the reorganization of local governments is also under negotiation, but because the country is facing difficulties and there are too many issues to be dealt with, no conclusion has been reached yet. He said that since taking office as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, only more than 20 members of the Youth Party have been employed, all in the secretarial and general affairs departments. These personnel are customarily those who advance and retreat with the minister; as for the technical personnel in the ministry, unless their performance is poor, he is unwilling to make any changes. Regarding the resumption of peace talks, Zuo pondered for a moment and replied: "In principle, everyone hopes for the resumption of peace talks, but there is no effective way."</p>
<p>The new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng, previously inspected the China Insecticide Manufacturing Plant, jointly operated by UNRRA and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and took a group photo with the plant director, Dr. Feng (left), and UNRRA's plant pest consultant, Dr. Dill (right), in the plant's laboratory.

<h3>Random Notes from the People's Political Council</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>The education report questioning on the morning of the 26th was unexpectedly calm. Some people think that off-site activities were successful; however, there were not many questions, but the answers were very long. Minister Zhu took a full hour to give a detailed answer, with reason and confidence, and seemed even more energetic than during yesterday's report.</p>
<p>Minister Zhang did not step onto the podium. First, he gave a 90-degree bow to the enthusiastic applause below, and greeted reporters in advance not to write about his frivolous remarks.</p>
<p>Minister Xue's report included quite a few "my brothers."</p>
<p>Fan Chengshu spoke symmetrically, "If the central government sets up a big engine, and the local government sets up a small agency, the central government has a big bureaucrat, and the local government has a small bureaucrat," which caused the audience to laugh. He also said that the people's burden was too heavy, truly "the Republic of China has ten thousand taxes."</p>
<p>Pan Chaoying said a few painful jokes, "Hainan Island taxes are levied on the living, and tomb donations are also levied after death." He also said that when asked, the people say everything is good, except for the lives of the common people.</p>
<p>Chen Yiyun boldly appealed to run the security brigade leader in the Northeast. Some people worried that she would not be able to "return" in the future. She said, "I am not afraid."</p>
<p>Foreign reporters specially looked for shots in the meeting place, sometimes squatting on the ground and sometimes jumping on the armrests of chairs, which annoyed their colleagues. After the meeting adjourned in the afternoon, the councilors went to the Central Hotel for a dinner party. More than a dozen news reporters "squatted" on the rostrum, scrambling to copy various motions and proposals. The "observers" were just like councilors.</p>
<p>Lu Qian's oral questioning was witty. He said that previously, the term "non-party leader" was used. Where did this non-party leader come from? Now, the term "social elites" is used. The combination of the two characters "elites" is still an original creation. May I ask Minister Zhang, where do social elites come from? How many elites are there in the country? The whole audience laughed.</p>
<p>Zhang Lisheng's oral answers to the questions were exceptionally sincere. Many questions were "answered responsibly," so the councilors were very satisfied. When he finished answering a question, applause rang out throughout the audience. Zhang was the only head of the Executive Yuan's ministries and commissions to receive the most applause in the People's Political Council report.</p>

<h3>The Battle Situation of the Outer Regiment in Changchun Improves; The Communist Army in Siping Street Collapses; The National Army Defending Jilin City Begins to Attack</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Changchun Dispatch, 26th] The Communist army that invaded Siping Street was completely defeated by the National Army on the afternoon of the 5th. The invading Communist army was composed of the First and Third Divisions. About 18,000 people were killed or wounded in this battle. The remnants fled to Shuangmiaozhi, attempting to sabotage the railway. The transportation authorities have ordered the urgent repair of transportation and communication equipment between Siping and Changchun. It is reported that the huge Dongliao River Railway Bridge was unfortunately destroyed by the Communist army after the defending army withdrew. In addition, more than 20,000 Communist troops north of Huaide retreated northeast through Fulong. The battle situation around Changchun has improved. The National Army launched a four-pronged attack this morning, advancing in a fan shape towards Chen'an, Shaoguodian, Fanjiatun in Huaide, and other areas west of Changchun, cutting off the Communist army's rear that had penetrated south into Siping, and intercepting its main force that was collapsing towards the north bank of the Songhua River.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Shenyang Dispatch, 26th] The National Army searched around Changchun and found no trace of the Communist army within 20 kilometers. The Difangshen Airport in the western suburbs of Changchun City was retaken by the National Army today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Changchun Dispatch, 26th] According to intelligence obtained from both land and air, the Communist army on all lines north of Siping is retreating to the northwest, with part of it retreating from Qian Gorlos Banner to the north of the Jiangbei area. Judging from this, the battle situation in southern Songhua is likely to take a sharp turn, and the Communist army seems to be in a general rout. The retreat routes of the Communist army are as follows: (1) Most of the Communist army on the south bank of the Dongliao River rushed across the north bank at Shijiazi, eight miles south of the city; (2) More than 10,000 people, including the Communist army's Independent First Division and other units near Gongzhuling, gathered north of Daling. The Communist army retreated from Huaide Fulongquan to Fuyu from yesterday afternoon. The road from Fulongquan to Wangfu was endlessly connected. The air force intercepted along the way and attacked the Communist army that was crossing the Dongliao River and Songhua River. However, the Communist army uses a lot of treacherous tactics. Whether it is really retreating or has other intentions, the authorities are closely guarding against it.</p>

<h3>600,000 People in Changchun Become an Unbreakable Combat Body</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency's Changchun Dispatch, 26th] The reporter went to the suburbs of the city today to inspect the city defense works and the situation of the citizens building outer trenches. The impression gained was that Changchun, with a population of 600,000, has now become an unbreakable combat body. Under any circumstances, it can support the Communist army's attack in any way for a long time. All parts of the city, from the edge to the core, are defended layer by layer, from individual strongholds to countless circular defense lines, and from these countless circular defense lines to a vast combat surface. All large and small buildings, as well as the hills, trenches, and roads on the ground, are adapted to the terrain for the best use, and the fire net formed by the warehouses, strongholds, and fortifications has made it impossible to take advantage of any angle. During the whole day of inspection, the reporter repeatedly visited the drills of various arms entering the position, and talked with the fully armed officers and soldiers from time to time. They were all very enthusiastic about their current operations and had a high degree of understanding of their tasks. When the reporter was inspecting the trench digging work, it happened to be when thousands of laborers were resting on the ground, each eating their own lunch. Among them were farmers, shop assistants, university professors, primary and secondary school teachers, civil servants, and students. During lunch, they sat in groups with acquaintances, exchanged food with each other. Soldiers on duty on the trenches were also invited to join the communal meal. The harmonious scene between the military and the people was very touching.</p>

<h3>Enemy and Puppet Supplies Discovered in Qingdao Refugee Camp - A Large Quantity of Machinery and Canned Goods Worth 2 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 26th] A large quantity of enemy and puppet supplies hidden in the Qingdao refugee camp has been discovered.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Urgent Cry of Shanghai Citizens</h3>
<p>The first session of the third Shanghai Municipal Council opened yesterday. This newspaper contributed the call for "Stability First" because we believe that in the current turbulent situation, stability must come first before we can speak of peace, restoration, and reconstruction. This is true for the domestic situation, as well as the local situation. Shanghai is the premier city in China, and the situation in Shanghai, from a broader perspective, is inseparable from the overall domestic situation. However, the development of the situation in Shanghai also often influences other areas. The Shanghai Municipal Council is the representative body of Shanghai citizens. In its efforts towards stability, it must proceed on both these fronts: matters of a local nature are the Council's undeniable responsibility, and matters of a national nature are also within its purview.</p>
<p>On the first day of the Council's third session, we saw that in the preparatory meeting, two emergency motions were eagerly proposed and passed by the general assembly. The first was proposed by Xu Jiqing and 42 others, "Requesting this Council to advise the CCP to resume peace talks, students to resume classes immediately, support the government in maintaining order, and promote permanent peace in order to achieve national unity and social stability." The second was proposed by Zhang Zhongyuan and 102 others: "Telegraphing the Political Consultative Council and the councils of all provinces and municipalities across the country, urging the responsible persons of the Communist Party to immediately send representatives to resume peace talks, turn swords into plowshares, and rescue the people from fire and water." Although these two proposals are still subject to ratification at today's first general assembly, they have already undergone heated discussion yesterday and passed unanimously. The key points of the measures are: (1) Telegraphing legal entities across the country, unanimously requesting the National Government and the National Political Consultative Council to advocate that the National Government promptly set a date and order the Chinese Communist Party to immediately lay down their arms, cease the rebellion, and submit to unified command. If they can fulfill this as scheduled, they can be regarded as a political party and still be treated with tolerance. The National Army will also cease fire on the spot and not pursue them. If they remain unrepentant and continue to use force, the government should immediately concentrate its efforts and issue a clear order to suppress the rebellion, and the Council should unite with public opinion organs in various provinces and cities to send a final warning to the CCP; (2) Issuing a declaration advocating that all parties implement the agreement to withdraw from schools uniformly, and requesting the parents of striking students to promptly advise their children to resume classes on a fixed date; (3) Supporting the National Government's promulgation of the temporary measures for maintaining social order and the four implementation measures formulated by the Shanghai authorities. Although we have not yet read the above declarations as of the time of writing, the passage of these emergency motions shows how the Municipal Council is working to achieve stability. The people of the entire city will undoubtedly be greatly encouraged and place high hopes on it.</p>
<p>What we are most moved and gratified by after reading these two proposals passed by the Municipal Council is that their submission truly represents the general will of the citizens of Shanghai. In post-war China, which is scarred by war, what we need is unity, stability, and peace. The people of China can no longer tolerate the current situation dragging on, and we immediately need stability. Only with stability can we hope to recuperate and rebuild. The current situation is extremely unreasonable, with both sides using force. While using force, one side still claims that the hope for peace is not extinguished, while the other is intensifying its military offensive and political disturbances. In this situation, peace is not a reality, stability is impossible, and the government seems to be acting without justification, which increases social unrest and makes the people feel more pain. In all efforts for stability, we must first strive for the stability of the overall situation, and then we can achieve local stability. Therefore, we welcome the passage of these two proposals by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>As for the CCP, we have repeatedly argued that they should prioritize the people, immediately lay down their arms, and work together with other peaceful and legal political parties to achieve the democratization and modernization of China as soon as possible. We believe that every political party should have an ideology, and while ideologies may differ, the goal of promoting the welfare of the people and the interests of the nation should be the same. Under this common premise, all political parties can cooperate. We know that the Chinese Communist Party is a party with an ideology, but we firmly believe that they should ultimately have the goal of promoting the welfare of the people and the interests of the nation. Under this premise, we hope that they will ultimately heed the urgent calls of the general public and resolutely lay down their arms, so that the Chinese people who have long suffered can have some respite. Now that the Shanghai Municipal Council has passed the above emergency motions, we hope that public opinion organs across the country will rise up in response and shout out the unanimous call of the people of the whole country: Save us, the people who are suffering! We demand stability!</p>
<h3>Students Should Indeed Rein in Their Horses at the Edge of the Cliff!</h3>
<p>The Shanghai student movement has almost reached a turning point today. Will it subside? Will it expand? Will it become uncontrollable? It depends on how the young students exercise their actions. Yesterday, Mayor Wu received reporters and said that the arrested students in the city, except for those suspected of inciting strikes and market shutdowns, had been agreed with Commander Xuan to be taken back by their respective schools and parents. Student representatives from various schools also agreed to resume classes in full today. The student movement, which had been surging, should now hopefully subside. Since "Stability First" is the unanimous call of Shanghai citizens, we hope that the student movement will end as soon as possible. Now that Mayor Wu has announced the results of his talks with Jiaotong University students, and all schools can resume classes today, this turmoil can be said to be over. First of all, we must commend Mayor Wu's wise actions and the authorities' sincere care for the youth. Students have received considerable education, and university students have particularly high levels of knowledge. As long as their overflowing emotions can eventually be overcome by reason, then with Mayor Wu's sincere attitude and reasonable handling, every pure student should be moved to resume classes.</p>
<p>Students are the vanguard of intellectuals. In their youthful years, they pursue ideals and are dissatisfied with reality, hence the so-called student movement. This is understandable. If the purpose of the movement is pure and the actions do not exceed the norm, it will naturally win the general sympathy of society and achieve the expected goals. Even if emotions sometimes cannot be controlled and actions may inevitably deviate from the norm, if reason can be restored in time and actions brought back on track, they may not necessarily be unforgiven by the world. If this student movement can gradually subside, it will be due to the action overcoming emotion. However, according to news received at the time of writing, some students convened a meeting again last night after the arrested students were released, which lasted late into the night, and it seems that they intend to persist in the strike. While this news still needs to be confirmed by the events of this morning, we hope that most students will still recognize the facts and no longer be exploited by a few who harbor ulterior motives, so that this student movement can subside here. At a time when the nation is facing unprecedented difficulties, what the people of the whole country unanimously demand is stability. Students are intellectuals and should deeply understand the difficulties of the times and start by stabilizing themselves and diligently pursuing their studies. If it unfortunately fails to subside, it is clear that their movement will go astray and may even no longer be regarded as a student movement, but as a destruction of social order and an obstruction of public safety, which would not be stepping into the legal net? We believe that students should indeed rein in their horses at the edge of the cliff!</p>
<h3>Correspondences from Various Places</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>He Yu, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Food and Grain Office, recently told reporters: "Currently, there is a lack of grain before the harvest, and rice shortages occur from time to time. This phenomenon is not due to a lack of food, but to artificial mismanagement. Although rice prices fluctuate, the counties of this province still have several hundred thousand shi of stored grain, so there is nothing to fear. We can hold price stabilization sales when necessary."</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Rice prices here have been rising again for days. At around 8:00 AM on the 25th, over a hundred residents from northern Jiangsu, carrying rice scoops and cloth bags, swarmed to Caishi Road, the north bank of the city moat, and the east gate area to rob rice from grain stores. The situation became chaotic, and over ten rice stores suffered significant losses. Afterwards, the police station arrested over twenty rice robbers for interrogation.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>The rice reserves here are constantly being exported, causing market prices to skyrocket and fall into chaos, approaching 400,000 yuan. Qu Zhenwu, chairman of the Grain Industry Association, suddenly submitted his resignation. The county government stopped issuing export permits from the 25th, monitoring market transactions to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Wujin</p>
<p>The black market price of grain in this county reached as high as 340,000 yuan per shi on the 24th. For the sake of the common people's food supply, the county government decided to implement price stabilization sales. The standard for price stabilization rice is ordinary and medium-grade hot rice. 170,000 units are to be sold starting from the 30th, in five locations.</p>
<p>Minhang</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received approval from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to issue 300 million yuan in local financial bonds. The denominations are divided into five types: 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, 400,000, and 800,000. They are to be subscribed by industries, businesses, and grain households throughout the county, and must be completed by the end of this month. These bonds can be used to offset this year's field taxes and levies.</p>
<p>Jinhua</p>
<p>In order to improve the conscription administration, the Zhejiang West Garrison Headquarters, commanded by Ou, specifically scheduled a military service conference for June 1st, to be attended by the commanders of all regiment management districts under its jurisdiction, chief staff officers, county magistrates, and military section chiefs.</p>
<p>Dongtai</p>
<p>This county has been suffering from a prolonged drought, and epidemics are rampant. Fortunately, heavy rain fell on the night of the 19th and lasted for two days and nights until the weather cleared on the 21st. Merchants and farmers throughout the county were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Haoxian</p>
<p>Zhang Shaowu, the chief of Jianqing Town in Hao County, was reported by all the representatives of the town council for falsely accusing Zhang Disheng, the chairman of the town council, of corruption and dereliction of duty.

<h3>British Labour Party Congress Opens - Chairman Noel-Baker Delivers Speech - Vigorously Advocates Promoting International Cooperative Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Margate, England, 26th] British Air Minister, also Chairman of the Labour Party Executive Committee, Noel-Baker, delivered the opening speech at the Labour Party annual congress today, calling on the British government to take the lead in establishing a new relationship of equality and trust among the peoples of the world. It is said that "Britain's internal difficulties are insignificant compared to the major problems the world faces. The major task now is to build peace on a solid foundation. The British government should try to develop a new system of economic cooperation between all continents of the world, whose development and expectations are greater than we have ever known. First, we must eliminate old mistakes and establish new relationships, that is, the relationship of equality and trust between the peoples of Western Europe, America, and the rest of the world. We must make the United Nations organization a factor in international affairs. If given time, this world peace organization will be able to complete its task. Anyone who thinks that the United Nations organization has been tested and failed only shows his ignorance and stupidity. But we must still convince our ally the Soviet Union that Britain's true interests do not conflict with theirs, and we must convince them that although the social systems of different countries are different, they can still live under the Charter of the United Nations and seek friendship and peace together. If we can end the fear of war, there is hardly any undertaking that we cannot accomplish. We can increase the irrigated area in the Middle East five or tenfold, lead the sea into the Sahara Desert, change the climate of half a continent, and bring water to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, making it a new land for whites and blacks to live in. China has more than ten rivers that need to be dammed. Believe me, the above projects are child's play compared to radar and atomic bombs. We must also remember that Britain's trade, food, raw materials, and even the living standards of every family depend on all continents, not just one." Noel-Baker then vigorously defended the Labour government's domestic and foreign work, calling on the country to support the government's foreign policy, and reiterated what Foreign Secretary Bevin recently said in the House of Commons, that Britain still sees itself as a great power. It is said that "Foreigners must not believe that Britain has declined and weakened. Britain's strength lies in its people, in its connection with the dominions, and in its friendship with countries that have jointly defended justice in the past. The British people are healthier, more educated, and more creative than before. The Commonwealth is becoming more united, and Britain's friendship with other countries on all continents is real and strong."</p>
<h3>Morrison Issues Warning to "Rebellious" Party Members</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Margate, 25th] Lord Privy Seal Morrison issued a warning to Labour Party "rebellious" party members on the eve of the Labour Party Congress held here, saying that sometimes individualism is used excessively, forming a chaotic situation, which is harmful to the country. Although the Labour Party recognizes the appropriate freedom required by the parliamentary system, it also hopes that all party members will not put the ship at risk of running aground. If the Labour Party can maintain its excellent form and act with good intentions, it will be able to maintain its power.</p>
<h3>Bevin to Defend Policy on Thursday</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Margate, 25th] The Labour Party meeting today was held simultaneously in two sessions. Speakers at the Lido Theatre included Irving, Professor Laski, and Lord Privy Seal Morrison; speakers at the Winter Garden included Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, etc. There were originally as many as 600 motions on the agenda of the Congress, but most of them have been withdrawn or merged.</p>
<p>[United Press, Margate, 26th] Two motions originally on the agenda of the Labour Party Congress, (1) expressing regret over the government's Palestine policy, which affects "Britain's good reputation overseas," and (1) urging the government to immediately transfer the responsibility for managing the Holy Land to the United Nations organization, have now been deleted together, leaving only one resolution on Palestine at the Congress. Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to deliver a paper on Palestine at the Congress on Thursday. The number of resolutions on diplomacy on the agenda has been reduced to fifteen, and the content expresses regret over the following two matters: (1) Britain's policy towards Greece has resulted in a reactionary government coming to power; (2) Britain fully supports the United States' actions towards Turkey and Greece in the Security Council. Another resolution recognizes that "it is necessary to maintain a very close relationship with the United States, but it is equally important to obtain very close cooperation with the Soviet Union." Other resolutions endorse Bevin's foreign policy and call on the European socialist movement to unite and accelerate European economic and political recovery.</p>
<h3>Compensation Representatives from Various Countries Inspect Japanese Armament Factories</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The inspection schedule for compensation representatives from various countries this week and next week includes one each of the Japanese Navy Armament Factory, the Army Armament Factory, the Aircraft Manufacturing Factory, and a merchant-run munitions factory. According to the plan, there are a total of 659 aircraft and munitions manufacturing plants to be used for compensation. Including the machinery in official and merchant-run factories, there are over 30,000 pieces. They have inspected only thirteen so far. According to our country's representative, they are most concerned about tools, because they are easier to install and faster to use. The machinery and tools that our country will receive as compensation in the future will be enough to establish twenty machine tool factories.</p>
<h3>Last Month's Japanese Yarn Production Breaks Post-War Record</h3>
<p>Reaching 34.8 Million Pounds</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese cotton yarn production has increased significantly every month since last November. It was 23.6 million pounds last November, 26.9 million pounds in December, 20.018 million pounds in January of this year, and 30.7 million pounds in February. April's production broke the post-war record, reaching 34.8 million pounds.</p>
<h3>Australia Supports US Proposal for Location of Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Sydney, 26th] This place, the "Sun" newspaper published a Canberra correspondent's wire, said that Australian Foreign Minister Evatt is supporting the US motion to set Zhengang as the location for disarming and reaching a peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<h3>Soviet Scientists Survey Japanese Sea Fisheries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] A Soviet scientific team that went to the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan to study fish resources departed from Leningrad for Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands today. They have four ships, and after arriving at their destination, they will be divided into fifteen groups to conduct research work in different areas.</p>
<h3>Little Progress in Japanese Cabinet Formation - Katayama Makes Last Effort, Democratic Party Drafts New Compromise Plan</h3>
<p>[New Asia, Tokyo, 26th] Katayama's work to form a four-party coalition cabinet, the Katayama, Yoshida, and Ashida three-party summit held at 3:30 PM today, seems to be nearing the final effort stage. Liberal Party President Yoshiyu returned to Tokyo from Atami Onsen this morning and convened a meeting of the party's executives at 11:00 AM, during which he re-emphasized the established policy. After the meeting, Ono notified Nishio that the Liberal Party still refused to join the cabinet. At the same time, Katayama and Yoshida went through the handover procedures for the old and new prime ministers. After the procedures were completed, he invited Mr. Ashida to the Prime Minister's official residence to hold a three-party summit. The focus of the discussion was still: (1) not to disclose the secrets of the cabinet meeting, and (2) to avoid words and deeds that would cause social unrest. However, these two items have not yet been resolved in today's meeting, and it is scheduled to hold a three-party summit again tomorrow. Then the cabinet formation work will be delayed by another day. In this subtle development, the success or failure of organizing the United Four-Party Cabinet is difficult to predict. According to Nishio's statement after the meeting: "The possibility of a United Four-Party Cabinet was originally only 30%, but after today's three-party summit, it has increased to 50%."</p>
<p>[International News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Democratic Party President Ashida told reporters: "During today's three-party summit, I and Prime Minister Katayama once taught the Liberal Party to cooperate in the four-party cabinet formation work. Yoshida replied that this matter must be discussed with the party before replying. Looking at the progress of the meeting, the Liberal Party's attitude has softened, and the Democratic Party will propose a compromise plan that can coordinate the relationship between the two parties, so the future of the four-party cabinet formation is expected to improve."</p>
<p>[International News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Democratic Party President Amano and Koasaka Zentaro were recently commissioned by the party to draft a new agreement plan for the four parties. Based on the results of the three-party party head talks on the 26th, they started drafting a new compromise plan between the parties, and scheduled a party cadre meeting at 11:00 AM on the 27th to discuss the content, and then submitted it to President Ashida for discussion at the second three-party party head talks scheduled for the day.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Releases Occupation Report - Reviews Strength of Japanese Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur recently released a report on the occupation of Japan, stating: "The strength of the Japanese Communist Party within the labor movement is difficult to determine, because the Communist Party often deliberately exaggerates its power. In fact, there are many organizations controlled by the Communist Party participating in the National Industrial Federation Congress. The National Industrial Federation Congress is organized similarly to the American Industrial Organizations Congress and is one of the two major labor organizations in Japan along with the National Labor Federation, with a total of 1.3 million members. The current strength of labor organizations in Japan is about 5 million people. In addition, Japanese farmers' organizations are also developing and are also related to the Communist Party. When the Farmers' Federation was organized in February last year, it only had 20,000 members, but now it has expanded to 1.2 million. Although the Communist Party only accounts for 1,000 of its 20,000 members, because the Communist Party has strict discipline and consistent action, its strength is greater than the number of people it occupies. In terms of Japanese politicians, the Communist Party's efforts to split the Socialist Party have now failed. The Socialist Party has exclusively dominated the police Liu in the recent general election, and its chairman Katayama Tetsuya has now been elected to organize the new Japanese cabinet. The general situation in Japan is most serious with economic problems, and political parties are now focusing on studying measures to encounter currency inflation and deal with the power of trade unions, so as to stabilize the relationship between prices and wages."</p>
<h3>Renaming the Imperial University, Abolishing Honorifics: Japan's "Democratization"</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The long-unconvened conference of presidents of Imperial Universities reconvened in Tokyo today and resolved: (1) to create another degree between Bachelor's and Doctoral degrees; (2) to abolish the word "Imperial" in university names, for example, changing Tokyo Imperial University to Tokyo University.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] After the meeting of the three parties, Prime Minister Katayama visited Speakers Matsuoka of the House of Representatives and Matsudaira of the House of Councillors. The Prime Minister proposed abolishing the title "Your Excellency." This term, traditionally used for high-ranking military officers and senior government officials, is thus being discontinued with the new Prime Minister's ascent to power.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Violates Albanian Airspace, Greek Officials Deny</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 25th] The Greek Ministry of Propaganda has issued an official statement denying Albania's claim that Greece violated Albanian airspace and strafed its people with machine guns. It stated that Albania's malicious propaganda aims to divert world attention and influence the work of the United Nations Balkans Fact-Finding Committee on security measures and that no one will be fooled by it.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Prime Minister Leads Delegation to Security Council to Appeal Anglo-Egyptian Dispute</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 25th] The Egyptian Cabinet announced after a meeting that Prime Minister Nokrashy Pasha will personally lead a delegation to the United States to present Egypt's dispute with Britain over treaty revisions to the United Nations Security Council. Members of the delegation include Minister of Education Naguib Hilali, Minister of Commerce and Industry Ismail Sidky, Minister of Public Works, and Senator Ramzi. Egyptian Ambassador to the United States Hassan and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Fawzi, will also be members of the delegation. The Prime Minister's departure date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Severe Food Shortages in Soviet-Occupied North Korea, Large Numbers of Refugees Flee to South Korea, Some Refugees Granted Permission by Soviet Authorities</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 25th] The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission is currently meeting here to decide the future of Korea, debating endlessly over procedural issues. Meanwhile, large numbers of refugees cross the border between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones every night, entering the American zone in search of work and food. Seven temporary refugee camps have been established along the dividing line between the two zones, accommodating 4,000 refugees daily, sometimes even 6,000. An Agence France-Presse reporter visited the refugee camps today, finding eighty tents sheltering 10,000 refugees over the past ten days. Three-tenths of these refugees are between the ages of eighteen and forty, mostly from northern Korea, but some are from the northeastern border of China. Due to severe food shortages in the Soviet occupation zone, they are fleeing to the American zone. Some refugees came to the south with the permission of the Soviet authorities, but most crossed the border illegally. They all unanimously stated that Soviet guards rarely shoot at refugees. These refugees stay in the temporary camps for two or three days before being sent to their chosen destinations without any charge.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Soviet Commission Issues Communiqué</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 26th] The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, discussing the issue of a Korean provisional government, issued a communiqué today stating that the meetings, which had been suspended for a year, resumed last week, and that communiqués will be issued at least once a week thereafter. This is the ninth communiqué, following up from a year ago, detailing the establishment of the commission and its agreed procedures. It also stated that the commission had examined the best way for the press to report on the progress of the meetings. Considering that the people of Korea and other countries have the right to be fully informed of the Joint Commission's work to establish a Korean provisional government, detailed joint communiqués will be issued at least once a week after each issue is resolved. The heads of both delegations also have the right to hold informal meetings with journalists to inform them of all facts that can be made public. The head of the U.S. delegation hosted reporters last Friday, and the Soviet representative also indicated that he would hold a press conference in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Negotiations Have Been Ongoing for Some Time, Planning to Raise German Industrial Standards, Developments After the Failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Regarding the Soviet Union's refusal to agree on the German question at the Moscow Conference, Britain and the United States are prepared to respond promptly. This Anglo-American move will first merge the western part of Germany and raise Germany's industrial standards, namely by increasing its steel production to double its current level. Anglo-American negotiations on this matter have been ongoing for some time since the Moscow Conference. This move is also likely to be Secretary of State Marshall's initial action, warning that the war-weary world can no longer tolerate the impasse on the German question. The current goal of Britain and the United States is to first increase Germany's production and promote its export trade so that it can pay for imported goods, thereby first enabling the Anglo-American occupation zones to be self-sufficient. Because the Soviet Union and France opposed German economic unification at the Moscow Conference, Britain and the United States have now decided to take this action within their occupation zones first. In fact, Germany's steel production and other industries are located in the Anglo-American occupation zones, especially the Ruhr region. Therefore, Britain and the United States may increase its annual steel production to 12 million tons. The exact number is still to be determined in the final agreement.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Recruits 60,000 Scientists to Organize Mineral Prospecting Teams, Scale Unprecedented in Modern Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Chairman of the House War Investigating Committee, Mr. Plumley, warned on the 25th that he had learned from authoritative sources that the Soviet Union had launched the largest mineral prospecting effort in history, involving as many as 60,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians, searching an area as large as 385,000 square miles. Plumley wrote to Mr. Millon, chairman of the Public Lands Subcommittee, that the Soviet Union had recruited scientific personnel in eighteen Soviet republics, forming eight hundred geographical exploration teams to search for oil, iron, fluorite, and other minerals. Plumley warned that the lack of natural resources may be the main cause of war and that the Soviet Union's actions are a challenge to the United States, with a scope of search that no other country can match. Stalin's production targets include 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 160 million tons of oil. The Soviet Union is currently using the latest automatic drilling machines, which are twice as efficient as those used elsewhere.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Republican Senator Brewster said today that he had received accurate and reliable reports from the Soviet Union that the Soviet government and people were organizing a large-scale mineral search, on a scale unprecedented in modern nations. The report did not specify whether they were searching for uranium or other atomic fission materials. According to a former German army doctor, captured by the Soviet Union and now extradited to the United States to testify in a treason trial in Boston, the Soviet Union has acquired largely complete knowledge of atomic energy. The Soviet Union has stationed many German scientists on a remote island in the Black Sea to conduct research. Before his release, he met with these German scientists, and their knowledge coincided.</p>
<h3>Soviet Whaling Fleet Returns from Antarctica</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 25th (Combined Dispatch)] The Soviet Antarctic whaling fleet has begun to return home. They stayed in Antarctica for five months and caught a total of 500 whales.</p>
<h3>Welles Delivers Speech, Discussing Indian and Korean Issues, Hoping Leaders of Each Country Will Cooperate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Former Undersecretary of State Welles delivered a weekly broadcast speech today stating that India and Korea cannot be truly independent unless the leaders of each country are willing to abandon their current difficulties and selfish ambitions and join the important task of promoting national welfare. It is regrettable that Rhee Syngman, the leader of the Korean Democratic Party, opposes the trusteeship system in Korea. Rhee and his conservative faction in southern Korea demand immediate independence. In fact, southern Korea can currently only achieve independence under a trusteeship agreement. Furthermore, after years of control by Japan and occupation by the United States and the Soviet Union, Koreans will not immediately assume the responsibilities and obligations of independence without facing political and economic chaos and prolonged civil war. Most leaders of Korean democratic parties are willing to work to establish a trusteeship system, believing that this is the only way to freedom. Secretary of State Marshall has obtained the agreement of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to resume negotiations by the U.S.-Soviet Joint Committee. This is a positive achievement. In addition, Marshall has indicated that the government will request an appropriation of $78 million to assist the people of southern Korea. This positive step is taken for the true benefit of the Korean people. As for the possibility of the division of India, unless all parties can establish practical methods to ensure that local self-governments are consistent with the management of the federation in terms of diplomacy, defense, finance, and banking, the concept of a new Indian nation should be abandoned.</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet Formation Encountering Major Difficulties</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] London, 26th (Broadcast): Gasperi, who was commissioned to form a cabinet, reported to the Italian President today on his progress in forming a cabinet over the past two days, lasting ninety minutes. Afterwards, he refused to reveal whether he had accepted the cabinet order. Observers speculate that Gasperi must have encountered major difficulties in reconciling the opinions of various parties to form a national unity cabinet.</p>
<h3>Major Announcement to Be Made in the British and American Zones of Germany</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rhein, Germany, 25th] British Minister in the Occupation Zone, Mr. Hangen, announced today that a major announcement will be made in the British and American occupation zones on the 27th. We can say that we are on the verge of a new era in history.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 25th] Major General McCloy, Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the U.S. Military Government in Germany, returned here last night from Germany and told reporters that the biggest problem today is to teach the German people how to live peacefully with other countries in the world. However, the German people are currently struggling on the brink of starvation and are ready to jump on any bandwagon that can provide food. They have no confidence in their political leaders but turn to the Allied countries, relying on them to handle the situation until they can act freely.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh President Rejects French Ceasefire Proposal</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 26th] The Viet Minh radio station announced today that President Ho Chi Minh has rejected the ceasefire demand put forward by French Commissioner in Vietnam, Mr. Billotte. The radio station broadcast two appeals: one calling on the Vietnamese revolutionary army to fight to the end, and the other calling on the French to stop the bloodshed in Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh said that the French proposal is difficult to accept and is insulting because it stipulates that the Viet Minh army must disarm to the French army and allow the French army to move freely and station troops throughout Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Holy Land Investigative Team Meets, Representatives to Fly to Palestine Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 25th] The United Nations will begin studying the Palestine issue on the 26th. Although there is some hope, there is no guarantee that a solution acceptable to the Jews, Arabs, and major powers will be achieved. The eleven-nation investigative committee consisting of Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, India, Iran, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia is responsible for investigating this most difficult political and social problem in the world. The representatives have gathered at the United Nations Headquarters, waiting for the opening of the investigation conference. The investigation is scheduled to be completed within ninety-eight days. United Nations Secretary-General Lie believes that the investigation of Palestine may affect the future fate of the United Nations and will deliver a brief opening address to the eleven-nation committee. After the opening of the eleven-nation committee, the representatives will elect the chairman and vice-chairman and discuss the investigation route. The investigation location will be Palestine, possibly including London, refugee camps throughout Europe, and the capitals of the Arab League countries. In addition to the eleven-nation representatives, the investigative committee will consist of fifty experts and consultants from various countries and fifty United Nations personnel, who will fly to Palestine within ten days. Before the departure of the eleven-nation committee, there will be a debate. The spokesperson for the Zionist Organization has requested that the committee visit the concentration camps for displaced people in Europe and Jewish exiles during the investigation, but the Arab leaders have vehemently opposed studying the immigration issue. The committee will hear the opinions of both the Arab and Jewish sides before deciding whether to go to Austria and Germany. The committee believes there is little hope that the Palestinian extremists will comply with the national request to implement a ceasefire during the investigation.</p>
<h3>Britain's Ten Conclusions on the Indian Question</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Political figures believe that after repeated meetings between Governor-General of India Lord Mountbatten and British cabinet experts on India, ten conclusions have been reached: (1) June 1948 is determined as the deadline for Britain to withdraw from India; (2) Delaying the political situation will further deteriorate the internal political situation in India. Only an agreement between the two major parties can prevent the deterioration of the situation; (3) The future of the Indian army and civil service cannot be determined until a political solution is reached; (4) Delaying the political solution will further hinder the legislative process of the British side to transfer power to India. This legislative bill not only has Britain's approval of the transfer of power to India but also has the approval of the entire British Commonwealth of the transfer of power to India. The King's address when Parliament reopens must mention the Indian Act. There are only five months left until the address; (5) Britain will never withdraw from India or part of India in advance to prevent the danger of turmoil; (6) Britain must transfer power to one or several responsible authorities in India; (7) All future constitutional resolutions should be made by the Indians themselves. The Delhi conference on June 2 is to assist Indian responsible leaders in deciding on a unified or divided approach so that one or more authorities representing India can receive power from the British side; (8) The existing constituent assembly can be a representative body for the Congress Party, the Sikh community, and the monarchial native states, providing a referendum for Indian leaders. As for the Muslim League, due to its boycott of this constituent assembly, it is bound to establish another constituent assembly; (9) The rapid decision by the Indians themselves on their geographical boundaries will have a positive impact on the deteriorating situation and will allow British and Indian leaders to concentrate their efforts on other major issues related to the transfer of power; (10) The smooth progress of the transfer of power can enhance the position of the British Labor government, because there are still some people who oppose the Labor government's decision to withdraw from India.</p>
<h3>Black Man Brutally Murdered, Murderer Acquitted, American Newspaper Angrily Calls It a Shame for the Entire United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 25th] In the case of the lynching of a black man, Willie Earle, by a white man in Greenville, South Carolina, the thirty-one defendants were acquitted by the local court. Although many white people in the southern states of the United States were happy, other parts of the world regarded it as a "mob trial." The number of defendants and the speed of the prosecution in this case are unprecedented in the judicial history of the southern states of the United States. Most of the defendants were taxi drivers, twenty-six of whom admitted to joining the crowd, kidnapping the black man, beating him severely, and finally shooting him to death. After the trial, three defendants were immediately ordered to be released, and the others were released after five hours and fifteen minutes of deliberation by the jury. The London Daily Express said that mob trials are still the unwritten law of the southern United States. However, newspapers far from the southern states also expressed dissatisfaction with this. The Richmond Times-Dispatch said that the entire South and the entire country will be disgraced by this verdict. The Atlanta Journal said that this is a government verdict and that the law has been lynched. The Memphis Commercial Appeal said that this is a tragic day for the justice of the American South. On July 25 last year, four black people were killed near Monroe, Georgia, by a mob of twenty white people. Although a reward of $30,000 was offered, none of the murderers have been brought to justice. The fate of black criminals is the opposite. Last Thursday, the local court in Sylvania, Georgia, tried a black man for raping a white woman. After only three minutes of discussion, the defendant, James white, was sentenced to death and will be executed by electric chair on June 17.</p>
<h3>French President and Prime Minister Appeal to the People, Coal and Electricity Strikes Still Deadlocked</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] French President Auriol inspected Bish, Upper Savoy, and returned to Beijing today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Annasi, France, 25th] French President Auriol, who is on a tour of the Alps, the former stronghold of French resistance, delivered a speech here today, accusing some people of trying to plunge France into turmoil and anarchy, and appealing to the people to maintain confidence and patience to assist the country's recovery.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Louhans, France, 25th] French Prime Minister Ramadier delivered a speech after arriving here today, appealing to the people to assist the government in carrying out France's reconstruction.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] The Electricity and Gas Workers' Union today defied government orders and announced a 24-hour strike on the 28th. Prime Minister Ramadier signed an order yesterday to requisition the state-owned gas and electricity industries to avoid the interruption of public utilities. Well-informed sources say that Ramadier is determined to ensure that this order does not become a dead letter.</p>
<h3>Japanese Also Conducted Research on Making Atomic Bombs</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 26th (Broadcast): Mr. Shirose, who is investigating the damage caused by the atomic bomb in Japan, wrote in a bulletin published by atomic scientists that, according to prominent Japanese scientists, after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Japanese tried their best to complete the atomic bomb experiment, but the result was a failure. Soon after the atomic bomb was dropped, the Japanese seemed to understand the nature of the atomic bomb and realized that they could not succeed in the experiment in the short term, so they abandoned all attempts.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 25th] The United States has agreed to grant Yemen a credit loan of one million U.S. dollars to purchase surplus U.S. military equipment. The loan is for a period of five years, repayable in installments.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] The first session of the third meeting of the Municipal Assembly was solemnly opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday in the main auditorium on the third floor of the Assembly Hall on Tanggu Road. Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Vice Speaker Xu Jilu, and 150 councilors attended. Mayor Wu, along with bureau chiefs and directors, Jiangsu Inspector Yan Zhuang, and Municipal Party Committee Chairman Fang Zhi, were also present. This meeting was held under a terrorist atmosphere in the society, so the mood in the meeting seemed more tense than the previous two meetings. Speaker Pan, Mayor Wu, and the councilors all expressed that the most important work and hope for us at present is to seek social stability and national peace. At this time and place, the responsibility of the Municipal Assembly will be even greater.</p>
<p>The meeting held the opening ceremony at 9:30 a.m. yesterday according to the newly-stipulated opening ceremony. First, Speaker Pan delivered the opening remarks, stating that today is the opening of the third meeting of this Assembly, coinciding with the National Political Council also holding a meeting. At a time when all parts of the country are calling for peace, the Communist Party is greatly disrupting and destroying transportation, causing economic depression and making people unable to live. Student movements have also sprung up one after another, causing social unrest and anxiety. Shanghai's economic and cultural position ranks first in the country. To seek national peace, unification, and social stability, it must first begin with Shanghai. Shanghai's social situation is closely related to the overall situation in China, so the responsibility of this Assembly will be even greater. In addition to discussing usual motions, deciding on budget expenditures, and reviewing the implementation of the resolutions of the first and second meetings, the most important thing in this meeting is "how to seek true peaceful unification of the national situation and how to seek social stability in Shanghai." Otherwise, if this chaotic situation is allowed to continue indefinitely, all hopes will be hindered, and discussing motions will be in vain. Therefore, we must do our best to solve these two major problems before we can "be worthy of the millions of citizens of Shanghai, be worthy of our own conscience!"</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying that he had mentioned in the previous two meetings that 1947 would be the most difficult period for Shanghai, and now it seems that he was unfortunately correct. As the speaker said, the most important thing at present is to stabilize the society. The current turbulent situation in Shanghai has indeed threatened the peaceful and prosperous life of every citizen. Although the municipal government has done its best to eliminate unstable factors, its capabilities and energy are limited, and it cannot but ask the councilors for guidance and to propose general guidelines to make instability become stability and jointly maintain local security. Subsequently, Xi Yushu delivered a response on behalf of the councilors, stating that now that this meeting is opened, he has infinite feelings upon hearing what the speaker and mayor have said. The responsibility of the Municipal Assembly is even greater under such an unstable social situation. However, the responsibility for stability is not only on the mayor alone or the military police council, but is the responsibility of all citizens. The Municipal Assembly is a bridge between the citizens and the municipal authorities. We hope to safely overcome this dangerous period. In addition, there are several points of reflection: (1) The government should also bear part of the responsibility for the high prices reaching this level. It is hoped that the central government will pay attention to local conditions when deciding on policies in the future; (2) The municipal government's budget is affected by prices and it is difficult to balance. It is still hoped that the review of construction funds will be planned leniently in the future; (3) It has recently been heard that the central government has issued short-term high-interest treasury bonds, which will have a great impact on industry, commerce, and commercial banks. It is also hoped that colleagues will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Advise the Chinese Communist Party to Resume Peace Talks, Urge Students to Resume Classes Immediately, Two Urgent Motions Expected to Be Passed at the Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>After the opening ceremony of the conference, there was a ten-minute break, and then the preparatory meeting was continued. First, the secretariat reported on the handling of various cases during the recess, and then six representatives, including Tang Shichang, were selected to draw the seat numbers of the councilors at the conference. Then, the discussion of two provisional motions began. (1) Vice Speaker Xu Jilu and 43 councilors, including Xi Yushu, proposed: "It is proposed that this Assembly advise the Chinese Communist Party to resume peace talks, students resume classes immediately, and support the government, maintain order, and promote permanent peace to seek national unification and social stability." (2) Councilors Zhang Zhongyuan, Tian Shujun, and 102 others proposed "Telegraph the Political Council and the municipal assemblies of provinces and cities to admonish the leaders of the Communist Party, immediately send personnel to Beijing to resume peace talks, turn hostility into friendship, and save the people from fire and water." Both cases were passed by the conference without objection, and it was decided that the secretariat of the municipal assembly would immediately prepare the text of the telegram to be reviewed and issued at today's conference.</p>
<h3>Five Measures</h3>
<p>Regarding the aforementioned proposal, five measures are stipulated: (1) This council shall first telegraph all legal entities nationwide and call upon all people's organizations in this city to jointly telegraph the National Government and the National Political Council, advocating that the National Government promptly set a deadline, ordering the Chinese Communist Party to immediately lay down their arms, cease their rebellion, and await unified integration. If they can fulfill this as scheduled, they can be considered a political party and still be granted leniency, with the National Army immediately ceasing hostilities on the spot and refraining from further pursuit and suppression. Should they persist in their delusion and continue to engage in military actions, the government should concentrate all its efforts and issue a clear order for suppression, aiming for an early pacification, ending military operations, promoting national unification, and establishing lasting peace. Simultaneously, this council should unite with the public opinion organs of various provinces and cities to send another telegram to the CCP, sincerely delivering its final admonition. (2) This council shall immediately issue a public announcement advocating that all parties fulfill the agreed-upon withdrawal from schools, requesting parents of striking students to promptly advise and restrain their children, urging them to resume classes on a set date and not be exploited by villains to fall into legal traps. Furthermore, all school principals in the city, regardless of the number of students attending, are requested to immediately announce the official commencement of classes to set things right. For legitimate student demands that can be accommodated, this council, valuing education and caring for youth, should strongly urge educational administrative authorities and school authorities not to stubbornly adhere to preconceived notions but to consider the situation rationally and accept them, so that villains have no opportunity to exploit, and the student unrest can be quelled. (3) This council shall issue another public announcement endorsing the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining Social Order" promulgated by the National Government and the four implementing measures jointly formulated and promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters, hoping for their effective implementation. (4) This council will send separate letters to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters, expressing its support for the order to suspend the publication of newspapers in the city that intend to incite subversion of the government and disrupt public order, and requesting a ban on the re-publication of these newspapers. In the future, if any newspapers or publications contain similar content with the aim of subverting the government and disturbing society, the government should apply the same measures to maintain social order more easily. (5) This council shall immediately telegraph the above points to the councilors representing this city and those residing in this city and appointed by the National Government, urging them to unanimously advocate for these points in the National Political Council to meet the expectations of the people.</p>
<h3>First Meeting Today to Hear Government Report</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The agenda for the third meeting of the City Council was approved yesterday as originally planned. There was no meeting yesterday afternoon. Meetings will be held from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM starting today. The first meeting will be a government report by the mayor, followed by questions and answers on civil affairs, police, social affairs, finance, and land administration. Regarding the review of the government report, it was decided that a comprehensive review committee will be jointly organized by the conveners of each committee, and the three conveners of the budget committee will be responsible for convening it.</p>
<h3>Feng Jie's Original Sentence Approved, Transferred to Shanghai Prison for Execution</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Feng Jie, who formerly served as the pseudo-Central Propaganda Minister and General Manager of the pseudo-China Film Company, was previously sentenced to six years of imprisonment by the High Court. The Supreme Court has now approved the original sentence, and he was transferred from the High Court Temporary Detention Center to Shanghai Prison for execution yesterday.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Minister Jiang Hongjie Escorted Back to Country for Prosecution</h3>
<p>Yao Minghui and Others Accused of Same Crime</p>
<p>Xu Chengen's Prosecution Dropped</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Jiang Hongjie, the former Minister of Transportation of the puppet Reformed Government, who had fled to Japan, was recently escorted back to the country. He is currently detained at the High Court Detention Center. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he has been prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. Wen Minghui, Tan Yunhua, Yan Ziheng, Ye Bingkui, Zhang Weizheng, and others suspected of being traitors have all been prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. Xu Chengen, who was accused of being a traitor, will not be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Owner of Minfeng Rice Shop Publicly Prosecuted for Hoarding Rice and Refusing to Sell</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Tang Qichang, the owner of Minfeng Rice Shop on Huangpi South Road, during the recent surge in rice prices, refused to sell fifty-two bags of rice stored in his shop, secretly transporting them to his residence at 153 Yanhai Road in the Nanshi area. Eighteen bags were hidden on the upper floor of the shop. After the local police station learned of this, Tang was arrested and handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, he was publicly prosecuted yesterday for violating the Food Management Regulations.</p>
<h3>Uniform Manufacturers Decide to Send Representatives to Petition, Requesting Winter Uniforms to Still Be Contracted to Businesses</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Eighty-five uniform manufacturing factories in the city, concerned that the United Logistics Headquarters Management Department will completely switch to having uniforms made by clothing factories, thereby endangering the jobs of over 20,000 workers, raised an urgent discussion on this matter at the second general meeting of the trade association yesterday. It was finally decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition, requesting that the work continue to be contracted to businesses.</p>
<h3>Student Unrest Unabated, Rice Crisis Rises Again, Mayor Frowns, Long Sigh</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mayor Wu received reporters at the Municipal Government at 5:30 PM yesterday to report on the handling of the student unrest. A reporter asked what the mayor's response was to the student unrest not abating while a rice crisis was also rising. Mayor Wu frowned and shook his head repeatedly upon hearing this, and sighed deeply, saying, "This is terrible." He continued, saying that he had been preoccupied with the student unrest for days, leaving him with no time to attend to the rice crisis. However, the Municipal Government had already decided on a countermeasure, namely, to have the Social Affairs Bureau thoroughly implement rice rationing. This month, 180,000 dan of rice will be rationed to schools, factories, government agencies, and organizations, and the number will gradually be increased to 300,000 dan per month. Although this amount is not enough to supply the entire city's population, it will be enough for agencies and organizations. As for the issue of rice rationing for the poor, it still requires a strict investigation by the authorities before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Prospects for Student Unrest Not Optimistic, Another Demonstration and Petition This Morning</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The student unrest in the city originally showed signs of improvement yesterday. When Mayor Wu went to Jiaotong University yesterday afternoon to respond to the demands of student representatives, the students guaranteed that as long as their demands (see Mayor Wu's report to reporters on page five) could be satisfactorily answered, all striking schools would resume classes tomorrow (i.e., today). The students expressed satisfaction with Mayor Wu's response. At the same time, all the students arrested by the Garrison Department the day before yesterday have been released. If the students can fulfill their promise, all striking schools should resume classes today. However, student representatives who insisted on striking held a meeting at Jiaotong University last night and still decided to hold a petition demonstration at 8:00 AM this morning. Therefore, although the government authorities are making every effort to show leniency to quell the student unrest, the prospects for the student unrest are still difficult to be optimistic due to the manipulation and instigation of a small number of students.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, Datong University encountered opposition from many Anhui students during a discussion on the issue of "flexible strikes," which led to a brawl and some injuries. The Jiangning Road Police Station dispatched police to the scene and took twelve students involved and injured to the station for questioning.</p>
<p>Moreover, after the arrested students of Fudan University were released and returned to school yesterday afternoon, the students who insisted on striking held a welcoming meeting and brutally beat many classmates who advocated for resuming classes, causing public outrage among the righteous students in the school.</p>
<h3>Passenger and Freight Rates on All Shipping Lines to Be Determined by Trade Association Negotiations, Council Held Emergency Joint Meeting, Representatives Sent to Beijing to Present Truth About Shipping Industry Crisis</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association, convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the China &amp; South Sea Bank yesterday afternoon to address the current shipping industry crisis. Secretary-General first reported that the shipping industry is currently facing difficulties due to low freight rates and rising shipping costs. The quota for ship fuel oil is also too small, making it impossible for more than half of the ships to obtain fuel. Various shipping companies are in critical condition. He requested a joint effort to find a solution to avoid the interruption of transportation. After a detailed review by the directors and supervisors, it was resolved that: (1) Starting from June 1, passenger and freight rates on all shipping lines will be determined through negotiations by trade associations. (2) Salaries for crew members in May will be calculated at 11,000 times the base wage, and salaries for technical workers will be calculated at 14,000 times the base wage. (3) The government is requested to relax the fuel oil quota for ships. The monthly quota for state-owned and private ships should be at least 30,000 tons. Representatives Hu Shiyuan, Zhong Shandao, and others will immediately go to Beijing to present the truth about the current shipping industry crisis and solutions to the government and the National Political Council. Subsequently, the discussion turned to the issue of the Water Transport Brigade's ships competing for cargo, which harms the domestic shipping industry. Director Liu Hongsheng, in his capacity as the Executive Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), briefly explained UNRRA's attitude towards the Water Transport Brigade. The establishment of the Water Transport Brigade was initially a last resort because domestic ships were insufficient to meet the demand and the transportation of relief supplies was difficult. In the past six months, the number of Chinese merchant ships has increased sharply, and cargo tonnage has exceeded demand. The transportation of commercial goods and relief supplies is very convenient and there are no obstacles. Since the situation has changed, the government does not want the relief work that benefits the country and the people to become an obstacle to the recovery and development of the domestic shipping industry. It is hoped that the shipping industry will recommend representatives to discuss the follow-up measures with UNRRA and the Water Transport Brigade. Representatives were then appointed to discuss the handling of the Water Transport Brigade's ships. Finally, regarding the government's fundraising for US dollar bonds, the directors and supervisors unanimously agreed that the shipping industry is already facing a serious crisis and is indeed unable to donate. However, because it concerns the national economy, they reluctantly agreed to subscribe for US$50,000 in US dollar bonds, equivalent to 600 million yuan in national currency, to show the shipping industry's patriotism.</p>
<h3>Private Electric Power Association Preparing to Hold Annual Meeting</h3>

It is reported that the number of representatives from provincial companies reporting and the number of cases received are both very high, and there are important and sincere suggestions on regulation, economics, business and other matters.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Sugar Rationing to Begin on June 1st</h3>

The Songshan District Fire Department dispatched vehicles to the scene and made every effort to extinguish the fire. Subsequently, the Central Fire Department also dispatched several vehicles. However, the buildings there were all made of flammable wood and plywood, with many shops inside selling food and celluloid toys, so once it caught fire, it could not be extinguished. At that time, most of the shopkeepers were asleep. Hearing the fire alarm, they hurriedly got up and fled for their lives, in a very chaotic situation. The Songshan Police Department dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order at the scene. The fire was extinguished after about an hour.

<h3>Automobiles Prohibited from Stopping Arbitrarily on Tracks Next to Tram Stops</h3>
<p>There are many automobiles on Nanjing East Road, from Zhongshan East Road to Xizang Road.

<h3>This Month's Index Strives for Rational Accuracy, No Rice for Employees, Based on Xian Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the calculation of this month's cost of living index: The types and weights of the items have not changed from before. The rice item in the workers' index is calculated based on a family of three. Recently, workers can get two buckets of rationed rice per month, so the basis for calculating the rice price is one-third of the rationed rice price, and the remaining two-thirds is the average price of Xian rice in the market. Since employees do not enjoy rationed rice, their index is based on the market price of Xian rice. The recently established Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee is scheduled to meet on the 30th. The May cost of living index will be announced after it has been reviewed and approved. The index will strive to be reasonable and accurate.</p>
<h3>Gold Rush Case Retrial: Central Bank Gold Allocation Accounts Inconsistent with Tong Feng Yu's</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Gold Rush case, watched nationwide, saw the court summon former Business Bureau Chief of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, Deputy Bureau Chief Yang Anren, and Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Industry Association, Zhan Liansheng, for a preliminary hearing on the 4th of last month. Yesterday at 2 PM, the court again summoned the three defendants, Lin, Yang, and Zhan, for a second hearing presided over by Judge Wang Jiachuo. Witnesses summoned included former Chairman of the Gold Industry Association Xu Busun, former Assistant Manager and Chief Teller of the Central Bank Business Bureau Wang Songtao, as well as Ni Zuguang, Xie Bingquan, Lang Liejin, Gu Luofa, Feng Qing'an, Lu Anru, Shi Hede, and Zhang Pijun, totaling ten people. Defense lawyers included Chen Tingrui, Duanmu Kai, Shan Yuhua, Yu Zhongluo, and Fang Fushu, totaling eight people. The public gallery was packed, with every seat filled. Five bundles of account books, large and small, were piled on the table, totaling over ninety volumes. The hearing lasted for three hours, from 2 PM to 5 PM. The court adjourned and rescheduled the retrial, with Lin and Yang released on their original bail, and Zhan remaining in custody.</p>
<p>Lin Fengbao Testifies He Was Acting Under Orders</p>
<p>After the court opened yesterday, court recorder Feng Duanxiang first read the record of the previous hearing, then proceeded to individual questioning. The first defendant, Lin Fengbao, testified that the 400-tael gold bricks were imported from the United States, received by the Teller Section of the Business Bureau, then delivered to Tong Feng Yu to be melted into bars, and then returned to the Central Bank, where the Teller Section allocated and sold them to Tong Feng Yu, Tai Kang Yuan, Da Feng Heng, Fang Jiuxia, and Yang Qinghe five firms. Sometimes, to save procedures, Tai Kang Yuan and the other four firms would directly receive the allocated gold bars from Tong Feng Yu, but they had to settle accounts with the Central Bank on the same day. There were two types of allocations: open allocations and concealed allocations. The amount of open allocations was known around 10 AM, while the amount of concealed allocations was not known until the books were closed at 6 or 7 PM in the evening. Gold transactions were reported to the superiors every day, and there were inventory lists available for inspection. The bank's audit department also regularly audited the accounts and checked the inventory. In response to the court's question about the importance of gold purchasing fees, and why gold was delivered based solely on receipts without first preparing the vouchers, Lin replied that preparing vouchers was an internal procedural matter that the defendant had no authority to interfere with, and that he was merely acting under the orders of President Bei. At this point, the court summoned witness Wang Songtao for questioning. Wang stated: "The allocation slips were signed by Deputy Director Yang. The allocation amount was not known until 5 or 6 PM. Gold bars were paid out based on the receipts from gold and silver shops. This was under the direction of Deputy Director Yang."</p>
<p>Significant Discrepancies in Gold Allocation Accounts</p>
<p>The court then turned to questioning Lin Fengbao, to verify the results of comparing the accounts of the Central Bank and Tong Feng Yu. The discrepancies were significant, with the Central Bank's accounts showing less and Tong Feng Yu's accounts showing more. For example, on January 4th, there was a difference of 58 bars, on the 8th, 45 bars, on the 9th, 112 bars, on the 10th, 115 bars, on the 11th, 25 bars, on the 14th, 27 bars, on the 15th, 45 bars, on the 16th, 46 bars, on the 17th, 40 bars, on the 18th, 87 bars, on the 20th, 120 bars, on the 21st, 146 bars, on the 22nd, 86 bars, on the 23rd, 95 bars, on the 24th, 300 bars, and on the 25th, 475 bars. What was the reason for this? Lawyer Duanmu Kai requested that the court send a letter to the Central Bank for a thorough investigation to reveal the truth. The court expressed dissatisfaction that the account books sent by the Central Bank were all loose-leaf pages. Lin also found them to be perfunctory, but stated that the Central Bank's accounting department was staffed by personnel dispatched by the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and that he had no authority to interfere.</p>
<p>Inconsistent Testimony in Two Instances</p>
<p>The second defendant, Yang Anren, was then summoned to testify. He stated that the applications and receipts from gold and silver shops were handled separately, and that there was a transaction slip for each day's transactions, with the chairmen of the gold and silver industries receiving the allocated gold bars. Witness Wang Songtao was then cross-examined, and because Wang's testimony was inconsistent in the two instances, the court was quite angry. Wang hurriedly admitted his mistake, saying that he had not heard clearly. The court continued to question Yang, who admitted that the daily allocation amounts were under his direction. Regarding the account books sent by the Central Bank to the court, he stated that they were draft accounts, and that there were official account books (inventory accounts) in the accounting department, and that these loose-leaf accounts were a new style. The third defendant, Zhan Liansheng, was then summoned to testify. He stated that from last year until January 27th of this year, Tong Feng Yu was responsible for the allocation and sale. After January 27th, the Central Bank was directly responsible for the allocation and sale, with Tong Feng Yu responsible for melting. As for the discrepancy on the January 27th account, where the Central Bank recorded 1820 bars and Tong Feng Yu only recorded 820 bars, a difference of 1000 bars, the reason was that due to the morning and afternoon relationship, there was not enough time to settle the accounts, so the 1000 bars were transferred to the next day for payment. The court questioned why the Central Bank's January 27th account clearly stated that the money and goods were received and paid clearly, Zhan stammered. At this point, witness Xu Busun, former Chairman of the Gold Industry Association, testified: "I served as chairman of the association from the 16th year of the Republic until the reorganization after the victory in the 34th year, when Zhan Liansheng succeeded me. Last year, Central Bank President Bei Zuyi approached me to ask for my help with the allocation and sale of gold. I replied that I was no longer qualified. Later, Zhan Liansheng contacted Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren to handle this matter. It was not introduced by me, I only offered a little advice. Zhan has never lost credit, the rest I do not know." The court hearing ended here. After the defendants and witnesses signed their statements, the retrial was rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Mediates Student Unrest: Arrested Students Released Yesterday; Professors from Fudan and Other Schools Offer Opinions, Mayor Expresses Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, students from Jiaotong University planned to march to the Municipal Government to request the release of their arrested classmates, and first sent representatives to visit Mayor Wu. Upon receiving the news, Mayor Wu went to Jiaotong University in Xujiahui at 12:15 PM, stating that the arrested students could be claimed by the school or their parents. As for the eleven students detained from Shanghai Law School, because there was evidence of inciting strikes and market closures, they must wait for judicial proceedings. However, he promised that within three days after the students resumed classes, he would negotiate with the court and the Ministry of Justice on their behalf, and according to legal provisions, if the crime was punishable by a maximum sentence of five years or less, he could find a way to release them on bail.</p>
<p>Mayor Approves Five Points</p>
<p>At the same time, at the request of the students, Mayor Wu immediately approved five points: (1) All students arrested in recent days will be released uniformly before 5:00 PM yesterday (the 26th). (2) Injured students will be treated free of charge by the Municipal Government. (3) The military and police shall not enter the school without the consent of the school. (4) Student meetings within the school shall not be interfered with if permitted by the school. (5) Severely punish the murderers (but there must be witnesses and physical evidence). The students have agreed to resume classes today. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Mayor Wu met with reporters from various newspapers in the Municipal Government conference room and announced the situation of mediating the student unrest at Jiaotong University as above.</p>
<p>Professors' Four Opinions</p>
<p>Also: Zhang Zhirang, Dean of the Law School of Fudan University, professors Qiu Hansheng, Gu Zhongyi, Sun Dayu, Lv Yuzhui, Sun Zeying of Jiaotong University, Shen Tilan of St. John's University, Jiao Tong of Shanghai Law School, and Cao Weifeng of Jinan University, and other nine people jointly visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon to request the release of the arrested students from various schools. At that time, Mayor Wu stated that the students had agreed to resume classes, and the arrested students could be released around 5:00 PM. The professors all felt satisfied, but put forward four opinions to Mayor Wu: (1) Instruct the relevant agencies that future disputes in various schools should be resolved within the school. (2) Local authorities should avoid intervening, and military and police should not be dispatched unless they are related to public security and without notification from the school authorities. (3) School authorities should focus on persuasion when dealing with student unrest. (4) Students should use reasoned methods for disputes and avoid using force. Mayor Wu expressed his agreement and asked the professors to advise the students to abide by their promises and resume classes on the 27th. The professors left at 4:45 PM.</p>
<h3>All Students Released on Bail Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Ninety students from Jiaotong, Tongji, Fudan, and other schools who were sent to the Garrison Headquarters for detention were gradually released on bail yesterday by their parents and principals. By 6:40 PM, all had been released from the Garrison Headquarters. In the morning, two students from New Construction Middle School were released on bail by their parents. Around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Jiaotong University President Wu Baofeng, accompanied by Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, went to the Garrison Headquarters to complete the bail procedures. Tongji University President Dong Xifan and Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, also rushed to the scene one after another. The Jiaotong University students were initially unwilling to leave prison because two students from New Construction Middle School who were also detained did not have parents in Shanghai and no one could bail them out for a while, so they insisted on being released together. President Wu and Secretary-General Xie and others rushed to arrange the matter, and the Garrison Headquarters finally agreed to release them all. At 6:20 PM, the students walked out of the detention center in two batches. At that time, there were two school buses each from Jiaotong University and Tongji University, and dozens of students waiting outside the gate of the Garrison Headquarters. When the arrested students walked out of the gate, firecrackers were set off loudly, and they embraced each other and shouted loudly, then boarded the bus and drove away from the Garrison Headquarters at 6:40 PM, singing songs such as "Unity is Strength" along the way.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Just as the Jiaotong University students were released, two red police vehicles of the Police Bureau drove into the square of the Garrison Headquarters one after another. The vehicles contained dozens of students from Datong and Jinan Universities arrested by the Jiangning Branch and other branches that day. However, the Garrison Headquarters did not detain them. After Commander Xuan discussed the matter, they were driven back to the Police Bureau for their own handling.</p>
<h3>Commander Xuan Issues Statement: Hopes Released Students Will Not Make Trouble Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with reporters and issued a statement on the "student unrest issue," stating in brief: (1) A number of school students were arrested for violating martial law. After the presidents of various schools requested bail separately, a total of 90 students were released before 7:00 PM, including 40 from Jiaotong University, 39 from Tongji University, 5 from Fudan University, and 6 from New Construction Middle School. When the presidents of various schools requested bail, they stated that these students could resume classes after returning. The military and police authorities detained these students who incited student unrest, also hoping that they would no longer make trouble and return to school to study, so they were agreed. (2) If these students cannot restore order to the school after returning, and continue to go outside the school to engage in incitement and propaganda that disrupts local order, they will still be arrested, and bail will no longer be easily granted at that time. (3) Before yesterday, a small number of the arrested students were conspiratorial instigators, who were sent to the court for questioning. Most were not. (4) Political issues are very complex and can never be resolved by making noise and shouting, let alone be immediately improved by people with insufficient knowledge and experience using a simple method. If students are interested in politics, they should study more at this time so that they can recognize clearly and make more contributions when they engage in politics in the future. (5) The students shouted slogans, posted slogans, and went on strike and demonstrations, all for the sake of "anti-civil war." Who should be responsible for the civil war should be clarified first. The obvious fact today is that the Communist Party is creating chaos, so the government is suppressing the chaos. I admire the students for opposing the civil war, but they should oppose the civil war with the Communist Party (the real responsible party for the civil war) to be effective. (6) Now conspirators are still preparing to incite the "May 30th" and "June 2nd" general strike, general market closure, and general strike movement. Their attempts will definitely fail because anyone in Shanghai today most needs stability and a good social order and will never sympathize with these conspirators to disrupt order, and will definitely express firm opposition. (7) There is absolutely no problem with the overall security of Shanghai. If necessary, unspoken martial law will be announced.</p>
<h3>China Problems Research Field</h3>

<h3>Student Representatives from Beijing Normal College Decide to Come to Shanghai and Transfer to Nanjing to Petition</h3>
<p>President Yuan Luidun's Attempts to Dissuade Were Ineffective</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] Yuan Luidun, President of National Beiping Normal College, told reporters on the 25th that the quality of normal education does not lie in the difference between independent colleges and university titles, but in whether they strive to run the school well. According to reports: Students who demand "restoration of the university" will send five representatives to Nanjing to personally state the reasons for the restoration of the university to the Ministry of Education and request the Political Participation Council to urge the government to implement the council's resolution in the 34th year to restore the normal university. My repeated attempts to dissuade them were ineffective. In addition, the "Restoration of the University Committee" of the college selected five representatives to go to Nanjing to petition. Three of them went to Tianjin on the 24th, and the remaining two went to Tianjin on the morning of the 25th, and took a ship to Shanghai and then transferred to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Military Police Prevent Student Petition: Team Member Injured in the Head and Bleeding; More Than 20 Leading Students Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday at noon, a group of students from Jinan, Fudan, Tongji, Music Academy, and Commercial Shipping College, totaling more than 800 people, gathered at Jinan University on Baoshan Road, intending to petition the Municipal Government in the afternoon, demanding the release of the students from various schools who had been arrested in recent days. The Second Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Qingnian Army in the city, the Mobile Vehicle Brigade of the Police Headquarters, and the North Station Branch in charge, were ordered to send personnel to the school to dissuade the students from petitioning. The students sang songs and shouted slogans in the school, and many people stood on the walls or in front of the windows, wantonly insulting the military and police who were dissuading them from petitioning. The military and police tried their best to endure, and after a stalemate until 6:30 PM, dozens of male and female students took the lead, intending to rush out of the school gate. The military and police stepped forward to stop them, but to no avail. They then tried to ease the situation and retreated slightly. At this time, the students in the school gate threw bricks and debris at the military and police. Wang Zhicheng, a member of the inspection team, was injured in the head and bleeding, and Zhao Zhengqi, Lin Weichuan, He Zhenqiu, and others were also slightly injured. At this point, the military and police could no longer bear it, and arrested more than 20 leading students, including Ye Dapei, and transferred them to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. Other students fled or hid in the school. The Baoshan Road area was temporarily under martial law, and passage was prohibited. The military and police withdrew at 11:00 PM. Last night, the person in charge of Jinan University and the military and police authorities discussed the aftermath at the Xinhua Villa.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Professors' Association Opposes Moving the Beiping Branch to Tianjin, Explaining Four Reasons</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 26th] The Professors' Association of the Beiping Branch of National Beiyang University, in order to oppose the relocation of the Beiping Branch to Tianjin, issued a declaration after a resolution by the plenary meeting, explaining five reasons for opposition: (1) If the Beiping Branch is merged into the Tianjin School, then Beiping will only have two engineering colleges, Tsinghua and Peking University, while Tianjin already has four engineering colleges, Beiyang, Nankai, Industry and Commerce, and Hebei. This seems inconsistent with the principle of large-scale balanced distribution of departments and reasonable development. (2) Students of the three engineering colleges in Beiping account for more than 45% of the Beiping Branch. The existing equipment of the Beiping Branch is the most complete because it has not been affected by the war. In terms of history, the Beiping Branch is also the oldest. If it is all moved to Tianjin, it is tantamount to announcing the end of the engineering college in Beiping with the longest history, the best equipment, and the largest number of people. (3) Last autumn, the number of applicants for new students in various schools was three to twenty-two in Tianjin and Beiping, that is, the number of applicants in Beiping was six times that of Tianjin, which shows the interest of Beiping youth in engineering. (4) The relocation of the Beiping Branch to Tianjin, its books, instruments, and factory dismantling and transportation, estimated at current prices, will require more than 10 billion yuan. It is considerable to use this huge amount of money to develop industrial education or to enrich Tianjin schools. It seems too wasteful to use it only for relocation. (5) Industrial construction is extremely important to make China a modern country. The original engineering schools should be maintained, expanded, cultivated, and built. Merging the Beiping Branch with Tianjin is tantamount to abolishing a school with a historical foundation.</p>
<h3>Tongji Freshman College Still Holds Classes as Usual</h3>
<p>The words "No Propaganda" are written on the door</p>
<p>Although National Tongji University has nominally been on strike for nearly a week, the freshman college still holds classes as usual, and the order is quite good. The Anti-Strike Committee of the college posted the four characters "No Propaganda" on the gate yesterday to resist strike propaganda teams from outside the school.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Will Discuss Exchange Settlement Methods for Self-Funded Overseas Studies This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th] The government attaches great importance to the issue of exchange settlement for self-funded overseas students and has decided to facilitate self-funded students within a possible scope. The exchange rate is urgently needed to be decided. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will convene the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance on the 30th of this month to discuss the method. Relevant sources revealed that the state's foreign exchange is extremely precious. It is impossible to settle exchanges at 3,350 yuan according to the request of self-funded students, but if foreign exchange is settled at the government official price of 1,200 yuan, most self-funded students will not be able to afford it, so it is possible to take a compromise number between these two numbers.</p>
<h3>Women's Supplementary School Celebration: Singing Competition to be Held</h3>

<h3>Giant Encas Organizes Allied Forces to Challenge the Chung Lun Team</h3>
<p>The Chung Lun basketball team's second eastern expedition has achieved great victories in six matches in Shanghai, making their record brilliant. Recently, as the team has not yet returned from their tour in Xiamen with the Hua Lun team, the visiting teams, in addition to practicing daily at the gymnasium, have mostly stayed indoors. It is reported that the Western youth team Giants and Encas, having suffered painful defeats at the hands of the Chung Lun team, are still unwilling to accept their losses. After consultations, they have decided to form a mixed allied force to challenge the Chung Lun team again before the Hua Lun team returns to Shanghai. Yesterday, according to Wu Jian, the leader of the Chung Lun team, the team is willing to accept the challenge from the foreign teams. However, the players have been too tired from the past six matches and need to rest. They will wait for the return of the maritime champions from Shanghai before deciding the outcome. Therefore, the match against the Western allied team will have to wait until after the match with the Hua Lun team. If time permits, they will decide whether to accept the game.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Shantou team, organized by the Shantou native association, also suffered a defeat to the visiting team and is quite unwilling to concede defeat. They are also planning to issue another challenge, but it is said that the Chung Lun team has been away from its base for too long and may not be able to make it in time.</p>
<h3>Hua Lun Continues to Report Good News in Xiamen</h3>
<p>[Guoguang News Agency, Xiamen, 25th] The Shanghai Hua Lun basketball team, in its second match today, faced the Filipino community team. The audience was even more crowded than before, with no space around the court. As a result, Hua Lun once again reported good news with a score of 28 to 19. The Filipino team has strong players such as Cai Wenzhang, Zhuang Yuxi, and Li Shiqiao, the best forward in the Philippines, but they were also defeated. Tomorrow (26th) is the third match against Tong Yu, and the fourth match on the 27th will be against the strongest champion in Xiamen, the "Seeing Stars" team. That team also has several players from the Philippines participating. The Hua Lun team is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Xiasheng Soccer Team to Fly to Xiamen Tomorrow for Charity Match</h3>
<p>Raising Funds for the Xiamen City Games</p>
<p>The Xiasheng soccer team, organized by the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Association and the Xiamen Shanghai Native Association, is invited to go to Xiamen for a charity match to raise funds for the Xiamen City Games, as the funding for the games is insufficient. A group of fourteen people, led by team leader Shen Kunnan, is scheduled to depart tomorrow morning, flying directly to Xiamen. They are scheduled to play four matches in Xiamen, first against Xiamen University, then against the Xiamen United team, the third match against Yinghua, and the final match against Baima.

<h3>Ping Pong League Match</h3>
<p>Lianxing Wins One Division Final Spot</p>
<p>The second Shanghai Ping Pong League match saw intense competition in each game last night. In the third division, Post Office B defeated strong rival Xinsheng Hong six to one, maintaining their undefeated record. Although the Hua Lun Women's team in the fourth division suffered consecutive defeats to Siming A and Qingdao, all the female players attended, demonstrating excellent sportsmanship. Lin Jinlan's smashes, Zhou Ruihua, Hu Jiahe's defensive chops, their techniques and postures are no less than those of their male counterparts. Another match was between Lianxing and Hangzhou Silk Industry in the first division. The meeting of two undefeated armies was exceptionally fierce. Lianxing's strength was affected by the absence of key players Hu Yiping and Wu Zuochang. Silk Industry seized the opportunity, fought desperately. Yang Changxi and Zhong Xianfang were especially brave. After fierce battles, the two teams tied at three apiece. In the final match, Lianxing's lucky star, Fan Liangji, relied on his steady attack and defeated opponent Lin Changxin three to one. Lianxing reversed the situation, won four to three, and won the finals spot. They will await the winner of the Shanghai Star vs. Silk Industry match to compete for the championship of that division. There will be two more matches tonight, with Taishan facing Zhao Yi in the third division, which will be a fierce battle.</p>

<h3>Carson in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>One Set Lost to Ye Guanxiong</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] Shanghai tennis star Carson showed his skills at the Cricket Ground the day before yesterday, meeting people from Hong Kong and China. Because his partner, Mr. Zhong, was not well-coordinated, they lost to the Xu brothers three sets to zero. At the same time, Carson's true skills could not be fully displayed. Yesterday, there was another singles match, Carson against this year's singles champion Ye Guanxiong. The game started at 5:15 PM and was still a best-of-five-sets system. Ye won the first set 7-5. At the beginning of the second set, the weather turned bad, and it rained non-stop, making the court slippery, forcing the game to stop. The performance of both sides was very exciting, and the battle was very intense. The unstable ground often caused mistakes. If the game had continued, it would have been impossible to predict who would win or lose. Carson was eager to return to Shanghai and did not have time to reschedule the match.</p>

<h3>Civil Food Allocation Committee Held Preparatory Meeting Yesterday; Leaders Exchanged Opinions, Concrete Measures Not Yet Decided</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, to ensure the speedy and thorough supply of food for the citizens, suggested establishing a Civil Food Allocation Committee in the city to be responsible for the city's food allocation and distribution. Since the Minister of Food came to Shanghai last week to discuss with relevant authorities, it has been decided to establish it within the week. At 10 AM yesterday, a preparatory meeting was held at the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. The attendees were Vice Minister Pang and Counselor Ye of the Ministry of Food, Director Ye of the General Warehouse, Director Gu and Section Chief Ji of the Social Affairs Bureau, Secretary Ren of the Central Bank, and six others. The meeting lasted until 1 PM.</p>
<p>After the meeting, according to Director Ye of the General Warehouse, the preparatory meeting formulated measures for the name, powers, participating units, and amount of rice to be allocated, which need to be submitted to President Zhang of the Executive Yuan for approval. A decision should be made today. The General Warehouse has Siamese rice for allocation in the city. White rice and broken rice will not be mixed. The rumored price is 168,000 yuan, but this Siamese rice was purchased at black market prices in the local area, so the cost is high. Whether to sell it at a lower price is subject to the decision of Mayor Wu, Minister Gu, and President Zhang.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday afternoon, President Zhang and others exchanged views again at the Central Bank. In the evening, Mayor Wu and Director Wu also participated in the discussion. It is reported that concrete measures have not yet been agreed upon. The Ministry of Food intends to hand over the civil food allocation affairs to the local government.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise Again by Four or Five Levels</p>
<p>[Our Report] Because the weather cleared up, there were more goods arriving in the rice market. Yesterday, the North and South markets received 6,697 shi and 6 dou. Sellers, because the rising winds in the producing areas had not subsided, held their goods at higher prices, so the market continued to rise, increasing by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. The selling price of high-quality white rice has exceeded 450,000 yuan, causing considerable panic among the people.</p>
<p>It is reported that at 10 AM yesterday, the price of rice in Wuxi was once quoted at 440,000 yuan, but by noon it had plummeted to 380,000 to 390,000 yuan. This abnormal phenomenon was entirely due to an unstable base. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that he had asked the Ministry of Food not to purchase in the producing areas anymore, otherwise the rice prices in both rural and urban areas would not be able to be suppressed. The only way to fundamentally solve the problem is to quickly ship in foreign rice.</p>
<p>High-quality white rice was not traded in the South Market yesterday, with a quoted price of 425,000 yuan. In the North Market, high-quality rice was traded at 422,000 yuan. Thin rice was quoted at 422,000 to 430,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the World Food Conference has approved the allocation of a total of 150,000 tons of foreign rice to our country for June, July, August, and September of this year.

The Flour Association originally planned to resume allocation starting today. However, since the official letter from the Social Affairs Bureau has not yet arrived, it will likely be delayed until tomorrow. From then on, allocation will be carried out for six days a week, with approximately 7,000 large bags allocated daily. It is understood that the target of this allocation will be limited to various manufacturing industries, including bread and biscuits, large cakes and fried dough sticks, and sliced noodles. The wine industry and the pastry and snack industries will be temporarily suspended from allocation as they are considered luxury food industries. The allocation price of 70-pound foreign flour, according to the original negotiated price, is 100,570 yuan per bag for the factory price and 111,000 yuan per bag for the retail price, which will not change.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the central authorities, considering that citizens who consume edible flour in the city also account for a considerable percentage, are considering expanding the allocation of discounted flour to 500,000 small bags per month. In addition to allocating to various manufacturing industries, 50 discounted public sales shops will also be specially contracted to supply discounted flour for retail sales every day to benefit direct consumers.</p>

<h3>Money Tightens, Cloth Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market experienced tight money, and distribution was not smooth, so it stopped after a slight increase. Only the dyeing and weaving factories on the street showed a slight interest in 42-count fine yarn, so the quoted price was able to stand firm. The trading price of 42-count yarn was 12.6 million yuan, a slight increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day, but 20-count special double horse yarn fell by 50,000 yuan to 7.25 million yuan, and the prices of other counts of yarn showed mixed increases and decreases.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was stable at the beginning, but then due to tight money, actual sales were quiet. Many bulls in the market turned to selling, causing prices to fall.

As a result, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy agreed to submit the report to the National Government and decide on concrete improvement measures in the shortest possible time, so as not to disappoint the jewelry workers across the country.

<h3>High-Grade Bituminous Coal Continues to Rise; Jiaozuo White Coal Alone Weak</h3>

<h3>Cigarettes Return to Weakness in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market trend was that with the universal increase of 30% in tobacco tax, the factory prices may have fluctuated, so the market opened strong.

The afternoon price in this city was 540,000 yuan per zu, an increase of 20,000 yuan compared to the morning, and the market has become tight again.</p>
<h3>Export Sausage Casings Halt; Only Smugglers Can Profit</h3>

The current price in the producing area is at least 2,800 yuan per pair of raw intestines, and about 7,000,000 per barrel. The processing fee is about 9,000,000 or more per barrel, so it is really impossible to export. The market price in Europe is 1 shilling and 6 pence per pair, about 8,000,000 national currency per barrel, although it is better than the US market, but there is no sales channel, and currently only smugglers can make huge profits.</p>
<h3>Women's Woolen Fabric Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>All kinds of colorful light wool women's woolen fabrics, the market trend in recent days, are flat and weak, with few retail and wholesale transactions.

The market situation of men's woolen fabric, autumn flower tweed is very popular, and summer goods have risen to the saturation point. People's hearts are tired, and buyers want to promote the forward inventory, resulting in continued reduction in wholesale, and the market atmosphere may decline.</p>
<h3>Dutch India and Singapore Restrict Overseas Chinese Remittances</h3>
<p>The issue of overseas Chinese remittances, smuggling, and export foreign exchange evasion has attracted close attention from various authorities. The Ministry of Finance has now implemented three measures to strengthen overseas Chinese remittance institutions, simplify overseas Chinese remittance procedures, and relax overseas Chinese remittance standards, in order to increase overseas Chinese remittances and export foreign exchange holdings. According to financial circles, some local authorities in Nanyang often restrict or hinder overseas Chinese merchants from remitting money to China. For example, the Dutch Indian government restricts each person from remitting no more than 300 guilders, and Singapore restricts 85 Malaysian dollars per month. The government authorities are paying close attention to this situation and are negotiating with the respective countries.</p>
<h3>Balancing International Payments; Preparing to Revise Tariff</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the import licensing system, the import surplus has gradually decreased. In order to balance international payments, the authorities will use strict tariffs. The Ministry of Finance has started research, and import and export taxes will be revised. The principles are: (1) Industrial machinery that cannot be manufactured domestically will be exempted from import duties. (2) For industrial finished products processed domestically and sold abroad, the imported raw materials or semi-finished products will be refunded appropriately. (3) For daily necessities that are insufficient in domestic supply, a lighter import tax will be levied. (4) Imported goods that compete with domestic industries will be subject to heavy taxes. (5) Luxury goods will be prohibited through taxation and will still be subject to heavy taxes. On the export side, tax exemption or reduction will be used to encourage exports.</p>
<h3>This Year's Chinese Tea Sales to the UK Significantly Reduced in the First Quarter</h3>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Farmers Bank of China: After the implementation of the tea loan program, Hunan and Fujian provinces have purchased raw tea according to the bank's regulations and are actively engaged in production. Qimen black tea merchants are also successively purchasing raw tea. The bank has lent 1.8 billion yuan in these three places. As for the tea merchants in Tunxi, they have not yet started production. They still hope that the government can lend huge amounts of loans and then purchase raw tea, and they are unwilling to advance their own capital for purchase. The Farmers Bank of China has repeatedly stated that the country cannot lend large amounts due to the overall economic relationship, and hopes that tea merchants can take into account the country's difficulties and strengthen tea production. Qimen is a major tea producing area in China, and the government has high expectations for this producing area this year. The Farmers Bank of China will purchase tea produced in various places, boxed and transported to Shanghai at a price of 600,000 per box, and then sell it abroad. It will strengthen the export of tea produced this year. According to statistics from relevant parties, the amount of tea shipped to the UK this year has been significantly reduced compared to before. In the first quarter of the year before the Anti-Japanese War, from January to March, 1,663 boxes of tea were shipped to the UK, while only 283 boxes were shipped to the UK in the first quarter of this year, from January to March. The difference is huge. Other countries have also decreased compared to before. If the government and the people do not cooperate and work hard together, the future of tea exports this year is in jeopardy.</p>
<h3>Evaluating Old Tea Pledged First</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association members, with about 100,000 boxes of red and green export box tea pledged to the China Farmers Bank last year, totaling 60,000 dan. In order to clarify its actual export value before requesting the government to purchase, a meeting was held to decide to first invite representatives from the foreign tea export companies Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, and Yongxing in this city, as well as well-known tea experts Li Weiqing, Zhuo Xibo, and Lu Jiamao, to first assess the grade and evaluate the value, sign their opinions, and then submit them to the authorities to provide a basis. It is learned that the above six representatives went to the China Tea Joint Company on Fuxu Road at 10:30 am yesterday to first determine the preliminary standard qualifications for all tea samples, and will start the evaluation work separately from today. It is expected that it will take two weeks to complete.</p>
<h3>Fir Wood Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Fir wood prices are quite stable in the Shanghai market because water freight has increased, and it is rumored that wages for loading ships in the producing areas have increased too much, and the Fujian Zhuang has a unanimous suspension of loading news.</p>
<h3>Wine Market Soars</h3>
<p>Recently, Shaoxing wine and Su wine have risen by 50%, and the potential trend is quite strong. Baijiu has risen even more sharply, increasing by 150% compared to the previous month.</p>

<h3>Tea Spring Season in Western Anhui</h3>
<p>— Hefei, 12th Rapid Dispatch, Our reporter Bao Baiping</p>
<p>This reporter's tour of western Anhui is during the most beautiful tea season. West of Lu'an, the spring mountains are smiling, and the hills and fields are covered with tea gardens. In towns, villages, and mountains, everyone is busy with tea, talking about tea, buying and selling tea, and carrying tea by shoulder and car. The quality of the tea spring in a year has a great impact on the entire rural economy of western Anhui.</p>
<p>Lu'an, Lihuang, Yuexi, Huoshan, and Shucheng are all tea-producing areas in western Anhui. Entering the tea area, there are layers of mountain peaks. It is said that the higher the mountain, the more it is covered by clouds and fog, and the more fertile the black sand soil, the higher the quality of the tea produced, including its color, aroma, and taste. Like the Lu'an Qitou Mountain Guapian, it has almost become a treasure in "Lu'an Tea." This can also be seen in tea books. The Lu'an Zhou Zhi records Huang Xiao's "Crystal Nunnery Record," which once said, "Crystal Nunnery is located at the foot of Qitou Mountain, with overlapping peaks and heavy shadows, and the sound of the stream is like a roar. The top of the mountain is twenty li high, producing cloud and mist tea, a unique product of Lu." Qitou Mountain is located fifteen li southeast of Mabao. When the reporter was in Mabao, I heard that the current Qitou Mountain tea, the best tea is only a few plants, which is authentic cloud and mist tea. Early this year, several people with guns were waiting on it to pick tea. Cloud and mist tea is indeed beyond praise and is already worth ten times its value.</p>
<p>The tea-producing areas are divided into "outer mountain," "inner mountain," "east mountain," and "west mountain." The so-called "outer mountain" is low mountain, yellow mud soil, and the quality of tea is poor; "inner mountain" is high mountain, black sand soil, and the quality of tea is better. For example, Dahua Ping, Zhufo Temple, and Gantang of Huoshan, and Mabao, Liubo 　, and Gubeichong of Lihuang are called "inner mountain areas"; Dongliu River, Qingtang Gou, and Luoyang River of Huoshan, and Chuanbanchong, Balitan, and Gongdian of Lihuang are called "outer mountain areas." As for "east mountain" and "west mountain," they are divided according to the terrain. East of the Pi River in Huoshan is called "east mountain," and west is called "west mountain." In terms of tea quality, "east mountain" is not as good as "west mountain."</p>
<p>Cloudy winter, dry spring, low yield</p>
<p>Relying on the mountain to eat the mountain, common crops are difficult to grow in mountainous areas, so farmers mostly rely on tea harvests to exchange for food and cloth to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>Before the 20th year of the Republic of China, the output of tea in western Anhui was the most, with an annual output of one million baskets (ten jin per basket). Unfortunately, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the tea production centers of Huoshan and Lihuang counties were occupied by the Communist army, and the production and sales of tea were disconnected. Many inner mountain tea gardens were barren. After the Communist army was defeated and retreated in the 24th year, it had not yet recovered, and in the 26th year, the War of Resistance broke out, and the tea area was blockaded by the Japanese army. As a result, production and sales stagnated, and mountain prices were extremely low. The income of tea farmers was not enough to cover the cost. As a result, tea gardens encountered misfortune. Tea farmers gave up the management of tea gardens, and some removed tea trees and planted miscellaneous grains. According to a survey by the Huoshan Tea Improvement Farm in the 31st year, the total output of tea in western Anhui was only 406,000 baskets, which was more than half less than before the 20th year of the Republic of China. Who should the tea farmers ask for this tragic loss?</p>
<p>Lu'an produces the most tea, followed by Huoshan, then Lihuang, and Yuexi and Shucheng the least. The statistics of the Huoshan Tea Improvement Farm in the 27th and 31st years are listed in the table below:</p>
<p>(27th year)</p>
<p>Lu'an　237,000 baskets</p>
<p>Huoshan　200,000 baskets</p>
<p>Lihuang　102,000 baskets</p>
<p>Shucheng　100,000 baskets</p>
<p>Yuexi　17,000 baskets</p>
<p>(31st year)</p>
<p>Lu'an　160,009 baskets</p>
<p>Huoshan　136,600 baskets</p>
<p>Lihuang　120,100 baskets</p>
<p>Shucheng　20,600 baskets</p>
<p>Yuexi　12,000 baskets</p>
<p>After the victory, the production of tea in western Anhui did not increase. Although there are no figures for this year's output, a tea farmer told the reporter that the tea mountain cannot be frozen in winter, and rain is indispensable in spring. Last winter was colder than the previous year, and this spring rain was less than last year, so tea production will definitely not be more than last year. In this way, even if the output is the same as last year, it will only be 400,000 to 500,000 baskets. How to revitalize the tea gardens in western Anhui, and how to increase the production of tea in western Anhui, the reporter believes that this is a major issue in the rural economy of western Anhui. We cannot regard it as a sideline of farmers and ignore it. Assuming that the tea output this year is 500,000 baskets, according to the tea price in Mabao, 12,000 yuan per jin, the total value is 600 million yuan, which is of considerable value to the 600,000 tea farmers in western Anhui.</p>
<p>Lively Department Morning of Tea House Picking Tea Leaves</p>
<p>Walking the streets of Dushan and Mabao, the reporter saw a tea house every few houses. The equipment of the tea house includes not only relatively beautiful houses, but also many tables and stools for picking tea, large and small tea baskets for baking tea, earthen beds, and weighing sheds.</p>
<p>Tea farmers or tea vendors send tea leaves to the tea house. In addition to the buying and selling procedures, the tea making process is: (1) picking tea grass. (2) Stir-frying into tidal tea. (3) Drying into dry tea. (Called drawing fire, one handover fire, two handover fire, drawing old fire) (4) Picking tea (removing old leaves and old stalks). (5) Loading into baskets (the baskets are woven from bamboo, lined with leaf raising and round bamboo leaves, and each basket can hold exactly ten jin of net tea.)</p>
<p>Picking tea is the liveliest department in the tea house. In the early morning, when the sun is just visible, women always account for the absolute majority, old and young, all gathering at the tea house.</p>
<p>The table is full of dry tea, and they pick out the old leaves and old stalks and put them in a bowl, and the picked dry tea is put into the tea basket leaning against the table.</p>
<p>They sit on the bench for a day, and the wages they earn are only two or three thousand yuan, and they have to go back to their own houses to eat. This kind of labor sale is the cheapest.</p>
<p>Transportation Blocked Domestic Sales Difficult Tea Farmers Suffer</p>
<p>According to people familiar with the tea situation, tea in western Anhui has always been sold domestically, and it has been transported to North China and even outside the Guan since the Ming Dynasty. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the "Mist Eyebrow Tip" of Huoshan was once offered to the emperor. In the early years of the Republic of China, it was not only sold to North China, but also to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but because the tea making and basket loading methods in western Anhui adhered to the old methods and did not know how to improve, the original Jiangsu and Zhejiang markets were replaced by Zhejiang tea. In the past 30 years, in addition to sales in this province, most of them have been transported to Shandong, and the farthest reaches Tianjin.</p>
<p>Before the war, the tea from Lu'an was transported by water from the Pi River to Bengbu and transferred to the Jinpu Road north to Shandong, and the freight was 8 jiao per basket. The tea from Lihuang was concentrated at Zhengyangguan by both land and water, and transferred to Shandong via Bengbu, and the freight was 1 yuan and 5 jiao per basket. The tea from Huoshan was also transported to Bengbu by the Pi River and transferred to the Jinpu Road, and the freight was also 1 yuan and 5 jiao per basket. The tea from Yuexi was transported from Huoshan Shiqi to 　, and transported to Shandong via Bengbu via Zhengyangguan, and the freight was 1 yuan and 7 jiao per basket. The tea from Shucheng was transported from Sankou River to Pukou to Shandong, and the freight was 8 jiao per basket.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the Jinpu Road was cut off, and tea transportation was stagnant for a long time. Until the 29th year, it was transported from Lu'an, Zhengyang, Fuyang, Yuanqiangji, Boxian, Guide to Jinan. This road was very difficult to transport, but because of the benefits, tea merchants did not hesitate to take risks, and it is said that the profit at that time was more than doubled.</p>
<p>Today, transportation is even more difficult. The Communist army's best trick is to destroy transportation. The two roads before and during the war are not open, and tea in western Anhui has no way to sell even domestically!</p>
<p>Today, there are very few Shandong tea merchants who come to western Anhui, so tea prices have fallen. During the tea spring last year, tea farmers could spend 3,000 yuan for one jin of tea and exchange it for two dou of rice. At this time this year, although the tea price is as high as 10,000 yuan or more, it cannot be exchanged for one dou of rice. This makes the lives of tea farmers even lower. For the lives of tea farmers, for opening up the sales of tea in western Anhui, and for restoring domestic transportation, the reporter hopes that the entire Jinpu Road can be fully opened as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Foreign Company Circles Abolish the Comprador System</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong, 10th Air Mail, Our Special Correspondent Zi Jian</p>
<p>Most of the major foreign companies and banks in Hong Kong have abolished the deep-rooted comprador system that has existed for decades. Among the foreign companies, such as Taikoo, Fatten, and Tiensheng, and among the banks, such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, Bank of America, and Baotong, have all abolished the comprador system one after another. The personnel in the comprador's office under the original comprador system are no longer independent and have been changed to employees of foreign companies or banks. The comprador himself has been renamed manager or senior staff. This cannot but be said to be a major revolution in Hong Kong's ten-mile foreign concession!</p>
<p>Hong Kong's environment is like a kaleidoscope. We must look at it from many angles and cannot take one side and generalize the rest. Han Puson, the director of the United Press in China, after coming to Hong Kong from Shanghai, said to people: Going from Shanghai to Hong Kong is like "being released from prison after serving a term." This sentence is not surprising. What is surprising is that Han Qingsen himself "was released" for a few days and then voluntarily returned to "prison"! Hong Kong does not need boring eulogies, nor does it need malicious criticism, but it needs a true understanding, which will benefit both China and the UK.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Newspapers and Paper: Taking Another Step Forward</h3>
<p>— Taipei, 7th (Airmail) — Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu</p>
<p>The violent storm of the February 28th Incident has fiercely swept across, and the journalistic circles of Taiwan Province have suffered unprecedented misfortune, with many newspapers ceasing publication. Other newspapers, under the impact of the incident, also appeared exhausted, lacking money and paper, unable to sustain themselves any longer. Consequently, some halted publication, others closed down, and the once-thriving newspaper industry was reduced to only the China Daily News and the Shin Sheng Daily News. Although the newspaper scene in Taiwan Province now seems to be stirring from stillness, one instinctively knows that the difficulty lies in a single word: paper. Solving the paper issue solves everything.</p>
<p>Rare Machinery and Equipment in the Far East</p>
<p>What is the situation of paper production and distribution in this province? Dr. Xie Hui, General Manager of the Taiwan Paper Corporation, gave the following answer to the reporter:</p>
<p>Taiwan's paper industry previously had over twenty large and small paper mills. In terms of scale, productivity, and machinery and equipment, it was an industry of significant standing in East Asia, with an annual paper production of over 100,000 tons. Japan, having Taiwan, truly benefited greatly from a cultural perspective alone. After the Retrocession, these twenty-odd units were divided into private, provincial, and jointly-operated by the national and provincial governments, according to the nature of the factories. The largest in scale was the jointly-operated by the national and provincial governments, under the Taiwan Paper Corporation, with a total of five factories.</p>
<p>The Taipei Factory, located in Luodong, was formerly the Taiwan Industrial Co., Ltd. It has modern equipment, including two 120-inch wide paper machines and three cooking pots resembling seven-story buildings, capable of holding fifteen tons of raw materials. These are mostly rare machines in the East Asian papermaking industry. It suffered significant damage during the war. After the takeover, all efforts were spent on repairing the machinery and factory buildings. Now, eighty or ninety percent of the repairs have been completed, with over 4,000 tons of cement used for the cement works alone. The factory primarily produces printing paper, as well as Taiwan Bond paper, banknote paper, cigarette paper, etc. The output in March reached 285 metric tons. The most critical tools for the paper mill, such as copper wire mesh and felt, were nearing depletion. Fortunately, a batch of American goods has recently been purchased. With these reinforcements, the Taipei Paper Factory is likely to achieve its target of 50 tons of daily output.</p>
<p>Converting Pulp Machines to Produce Taiwan Bond Paper</p>
<p>The Shilin Branch of the Taipei Factory, formerly the Taitung Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd., specializes in producing various hardboards, such as roofing boards, white cardboard, yellow cardboard, and train tickets. There is no shortage of raw material, rice straw, and the monthly output is around 400 tons, exceeding the Japanese era. Sales are excellent, so although the factory is small, it greatly helps the company's finances.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Pulp Industrial Co., Ltd., now renamed the Taichung Paper Factory, previously produced only bagasse pulp, with a daily output of 50 tons. However, bagasse is currently difficult to obtain, and suspending operations would waste the efficiency of the machinery. Therefore, the pulp machine was converted into an 82-inch wide paper machine, using bamboo, citronella, daylilies, and other materials to produce cement company paper bags, the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau's cigarette cartons, and 50-pound Taiwan Bond paper. Although only 150 tons of paper were produced in March, it still manages to increase revenue for the company.</p>
<p>The Kaohsiung Factory, formerly known as the East Asia Paper Industrial Co., Ltd., suffered the most damage from bombing. The factory was completed at the end of 1944, producing about 10 tons of kraft paper and cement bags per day. However, it remained idle after the takeover until recently, when it was repaired to some extent. The test run last month was successful, and it is scheduled to officially start operations on the 10th of this month, but the output will be about 70% of what it was before.</p>
<p>A Misstep by the Taipei Paper Factory</p>
<p>Among the five factories, the Tainan Factory is the most promising. During the era of the Yanshui Port Pulp Industrial Co., Ltd., it produced nearly 100 tons of bagasse pulp per day. It is a grand scale and could be said to be China's largest pulp factory, with internal equipment comparable to that of the United States. Due to insufficient funds, repairs to the damaged factory buildings and machinery only began at the end of last year. The test run was conducted simultaneously with the Kaohsiung Factory on the 25th of last month, and the results were satisfactory. It is now scheduled to start operations on May 15th, using the bagasse stockpiled from three years ago as raw material, with an estimated daily output of 30 tons of pulp.</p>
<p>General Manager Xie told the reporter that the factory bases of all Taiwan's paper mills are mostly unsuitable. In terms of transportation, raw material supply, and proximity to the market, they are not the most modern and scientific locations. However, he also pointed out the reasons for this. For example, the Taipei Paper Factory was built in remote Luodong because the Japanese initially planned to use daylilies from the mountains near the factory site as raw material for papermaking. The quality was excellent, but unfortunately, the Japanese realized that this grass could only be harvested once every two years, which they considered too late. Finally, the Governor-General's Office allocated the Lintianshan Management Office of Hualien Port to supply raw materials, which helped them overcome the difficulty.</p>
<p>Preliminary Hopes for Export are Limitless</p>
<p>Buying copper mesh finally solved the most troublesome problem for the paper mills, but the raw material issue has become a new challenge. Although Taiwan has a lot of timber, most of it is construction timber. To date, there is no continuous supply of timber for making paper. As a second option, if bamboo and bagasse can be supplied in large quantities, the threat to raw materials seems unlikely for the time being.</p>
<p>The company's products were previously sold entirely within the province, and newsprint was entirely distributed through the Public Office's Paper Allocation Committee. However, only Taiwan Bookstore's textbook printing department and the China Daily News and Shin Sheng Daily News were eligible for this right. Currently, the allocation price for roll paper is NT$48 per pound, with an 80% discount, which is much lower than the black market price in Shanghai. However, the rationing system cannot be abolished until the increase in production can meet demand. Recently, the paper company has begun to export 100 tons of Taiwan Bond paper to Shanghai on a trial basis. This is the first export of Taiwan-produced paper. We hope that it will receive a good response and further hope that in cooperation with cultural undertakings, the paper company will make its greatest effort to enable the cultural undertakings of this province to take another step forward on a high level!</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>On China's Insurance Industry in the Current Stage</h3>
<p>— Wu Tongyuan</p>
<p>Recently, fires have occurred frequently in our city. In addition to actively improving fire prevention equipment, we should also proactively purchase insurance from insurance companies to protect our lives and property. Therefore, a review of the current insurance industry at this time and place may also have its value.</p>
<p>The meaning of insurance lies in dispersing the additional losses suffered by individuals or groups due to unavoidable or possible disasters. These additional losses are jointly borne by individuals or groups participating in insurance. The current method is to use the insurance industry as an intermediary, whereby each insured person pays a certain amount of insurance premium on time, and receives a certain amount of compensation when a disaster occurs, so that they will not suffer unexpected blows that prevent them from carrying out normal work. Therefore, insurance companies can not only protect individuals or groups from unexpected blows in a negative way, but also actively gather the strength of the public to try to improve the environment and gradually reduce the possibility of disasters. Therefore, it is not only a profitable business, but also has the function of serving the people and stabilizing social order. In recent years, many countries have used various insurances as the main social policy and enforced them by law, which shows the importance of the insurance business. Although China's insurance business has initially taken shape, it has not yet been recognized by all sectors of society. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a theoretical or practical review of the insurance business to enable the insurance industry to serve people from all walks of life in accordance with the current economic situation.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss compensation. Compensation is a kind of compensation that the insured person obtains from the insurer for the material losses suffered due to the occurrence of a disaster. In principle, this compensation should be able to compensate for all the material damage suffered by the insured person. However, according to current laws, the calculation of compensation is based on the amount insured at the time of insurance. As a result, in times of volatile prices, the loss of currency depreciation is entirely borne by the insured person, which is not only unfair but also violates the original intention of insurance! Take fire insurance as an example: Assuming that according to statistics over the years, the average number of fires in first-class buildings of warehouses storing non-dangerous goods is four per thousand per year. Therefore, the insurance association stipulated at that time that the insurance rate for this type of warehouse was five per thousand, so that the insurance premium income would have appropriate business income after deducting compensation. Now suppose there are 10 million bags of flour, each worth 10,000 yuan, stored on average in 1,000 first-class buildings of warehouses. At that time, each warehouse insured 100 million yuan of flour fire insurance, and paid a total of 500 million yuan in insurance premiums, that is, a one-time advance payment of 50,000 bags of flour, of which 10,000 bags were the insurer's handling fee, and 40,000 bags were used for compensation. Assuming that during this year, prices have doubled and the price of flour has risen from 10,000 yuan per bag to 20,000 yuan. During this period, the insured suffered the destruction of 40,000 bags of flour due to a fire in four warehouses. As a result, because the insured amount was only 400 million yuan, the compensation received could only buy back 20,000 bags of flour, and 20,000 bags of flour were sacrificed invisibly. On the contrary, after the insurer obtained 50,000 bags of insurance premiums, the value of investment operations remained unchanged. After deducting 10,000 bags of flour for expenses and surplus, the remaining 40,000 bags of flour were used for compensation. As a result, due to currency changes, only 20,000 bags of flour needed to be compensated, resulting in an unexpected surplus of 20,000 bags of flour. Assuming that the more the currency depreciates, the greater the loss of the insured person and the more the insurer gains without labor, it is said that during the period of price changes, the insured person can increase the value at any time and go through the procedures for additional insurance, but in fact the insured person has already prepaid one year of insurance premium, and this additional insurance premium is the loss when the currency depreciates. Even with life insurance, whether it is life insurance for death or survival annuity, its nature is similar to a fixed deposit. Not only is the total value of the life insurance money far less than the life insurance premium paid on time, but also the original intention of insurance is completely lost, because the meager life insurance money is not enough to enjoy the old age when alive, and not enough to pay for the dead when dead. In this way, it is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish if you want to develop the life insurance business. Therefore, compensation is the main focus of the current insurance industry, and whether its measures are appropriate can affect the fate of the insurance industry. In recent years, the index life insurance held by the China Trust Life Insurance Office is used to correct this drawback, but it is only limited to the life insurance end. According to the same method, property insurance should also follow the example of index life insurance and take the principle of compensating for physical objects, otherwise the amount of compensation should also be calculated based on the replacement value. However, whether the insurer has the ability to bear the physical compensation is also worthy of our consideration. For example, the price of the insured property increases more than the price index, or the surplus obtained from narrow investment outlets is not enough to offset the depreciation of the currency, resulting in only a little more than 40,000 bags of insurance premiums for 50,000 bags of flour. After deducting 40,000 bags of physical compensation, the remainder is not enough for business expenses. Naturally, it is also not acceptable to the insurance industry. However, according to the current method, the loss of the entire currency depreciation is borne by the insured person, which is also unfair. A compromise can be to adopt the method of paying insurance premiums in installments, so as to reduce the loss of the insured person without causing the insurer to have the suspicion of gaining without labor. The method is that the insurance premium for a one-year policy can be paid in four installments. If the currency fluctuates greatly, it can be paid in twelve installments. If the insured person is willing to pay in one lump sum, it can be converted into several discounts based on the market interest rate according to the present value method of annuity. If compensation occurs midway, the unpaid insurance premium can be deducted from the compensation money. This method can take care of both parties and can be used as a reference for the insurance authorities.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of insurance premium rates, the formulation of insurance premium rates is similar in nature to the pricing of goods by ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises. Reasonable and correct premium rates can enable the insured to pay the lowest insurance premium and the insurer can obtain considerable business profits. Otherwise, too high or too low will affect the promotion of legitimate business. Theoretically, the insurance premium rate should be based on the probability of various disasters, plus business expenses and surplus factors. Therefore, the insurance premium rate should be based on various statistical data in order to seek its accuracy, such as life insurance based on the mortality rate of various ages in a certain city, etc. However, this premium rate is not immutable. For example, due to new achievements in science, or improvements in various environments, the occurrence of harm can be reduced. For example, after continuous research and improvement by scientists, BCG can be widely used in medicine, resulting in a large reduction in tuberculosis patients, so as to reduce the population mortality rate in large cities. In this way, the life insurance premium should also be reduced accordingly. Its nature is similar to that of a factory that greatly increases production and reduces costs due to the implementation of scientific management, which reduces the selling price. However, this kind of data still needs to be based on daily statistics. Therefore, if you want to improve the insurance business, you must carry out various statistical work to obtain scientific basis. Theoretically speaking, the longer the age of the statistical figures or the more data collected, the smaller the probable error and the more correct the conclusion. However, during the period of price fluctuations, this kind of statistical work is difficult to carry out, because the currency value of each period is different, and the correctness of calculating the absolute numbers of different currency values side by side is doubtful, especially during the period when the currency value is accelerating. The weight of the later stage is very large. In other words, this conclusion is entirely based on the figures of the last few months, and the large error is self-evident. This drawback is not irreparable. We can eliminate the factors of currency depreciation based on the price index. Of course, this cumbersome work is not something that a few insurance companies can handle, but we can gather the strength of the industry to help this effort, so that the insurance business can cooperate with the social and economic environment of each era to strengthen the foundation of the insurance business!</p>
<p>During the period of price fluctuations, the insurance industry has its own unique advantages. Assuming that the business remains unchanged, the income of the insurance industry can follow the price index at any time, because the insurance premium is proportional to the insured amount, and the insured amount rises and falls according to the price index at any time, so the insurance premium income is also proportional to the price index, and does not need to adjust its selling price at any time due to the depreciation of the currency as other industries do. Therefore, how to strive for improvement during this period to lay the foundation for the insurance industry is the most important task for the insurance industry.</p>

<h3>Joint Appeal from Tenants in Tangqi</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, The rent of houses in Tangqi Town has always been higher than in nearby areas. The reason for this is that most of the houses in the town are owned by a few large households, who arbitrarily manipulate the market. After the victory, the landlords discriminated against the legal tender and created the practice of paying rent in rice. Merchants were eager to make a living and initially endured the practice, but due to the impact of economic turbulence, the market plummeted, while rents increased year after year. Recently, rice prices have soared, and the daily business income of shops is not enough to pay the rent. All the merchants in the town have no means of livelihood, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and the society is in a state of unrest. Therefore, the merchants in the town were forced to save themselves and united to organize a Tenants' Association. The requirements are nothing more than (1) abolishing the evil practice of converting rent prices with rice (2) middlemen should not fuel the flames, and a notarization system should be implemented (3) following the Gregorian calendar, and abolishing the old practice of calculating rent with the lunar calendar, (4) reducing the deposit (5) the landlord should bear the cost of house repairs and taxes that the landlord should be responsible for, and should not force the tenants to bear them (6) the landlord should not arbitrarily terminate the lease by pretext of self-use if the tenant does not owe rent, etc. In addition to requesting the competent authorities to approve the filing of this organization, we also ask the county government to issue the Hangzhou County Store Renting Regulations to obtain a reasonable rental relationship. We hope that your newspaper will grant a small space for disclosure and seek the sympathy of all sectors. (Li Ahe)</p>
<h3>Reply Regarding Transportation Suggestions</h3>
<p>This newspaper forwarded reader Mr. Li Zuoyuan's letter suggesting improvement of traffic in this city to the Public Transportation Company of this city for verification. We now received a reply from the Transportation Company stating: "We have read Mr. Li's suggestions, and we deeply appreciate his profound insights and unique perspectives. In addition to sincerely adopting them and expressing our gratitude, we also have the following two statements: (1) The reason why the No. 9 and No. 7 buses do not extend into the central district is that there is no wide parking location in the central district, which prevents vehicles from turning around. Currently, the No. 3, No. 4, and No. 10 routes on the Bund of Beijing Road and the Bund of Nanjing Road all have stations, and it is also planned to set up a large-scale bus terminal on the Bund (including the No. 9 and No. 7 routes), which is being submitted to the Municipal Transportation Conference for approval. In addition, the No. 7 route has recently decided to expand from the Wusong Road intersection to the Bund of East Zhongzheng Road first, and connect with the lines in the central district, which will be implemented soon. (2) The reason why the driving time of drivers must be rigidly stipulated is that it is easy to cause disorder if the driving time is not stipulated. If drivers are allowed to adjust themselves, it is inevitable that there will be problems of speeding or slowing down. As for the driver arriving at the terminal, if there is time to spare, he can get off the bus to check the parts. The section of 6 or 7 vehicles gathering at the terminal that you mentioned is a temporary extra bus that is specially used to solve passenger congestion during daily office hours. There will not be this phenomenon at other times." This is recorded.</p>
<h3>Please Change the Time to Clear Garbage</h3>
<p>Outside my front door and front window, every night after 9 o'clock, a large amount of garbage is piled up by vehicles from the Baxianfang alley, and the stench is straight up, which greatly threatens hygiene and safety. I would like to ask the authorities to order the garbage trucks from that place to extend the time to after most people have gone to bed, and the large garbage trucks that carry them to the next morning should be brought forward, and I hope that the address where the garbage is piled will be set up far away from the windows, so as not to hinder the hygiene of the people in the alley and my family.

<h3>Unfair Distribution of Labor Services</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, It has been found that civil servants were allocated five zhang of bleached cloth and one zhang and five chi of khaki per person this month, while laborers were allocated only one zhang and five chi of bleached cloth per person. Laborers also have parents, families, and wives, so why are they only allocated so little? It seems unfair in terms of emotion and reason. The bleached cloth allocated to laborers is not suitable or economical, because most laborers do manual work and are very easily soiled. They need to use more soap every day to wash them. It is better to use khaki cloth. I hope that your newspaper will grant a small space for the authorities to allocate more khaki cloth and hope to improve the quantity. (A Laborer from Shanghai)</p>

<h3>My Last Thought</h3>
<p>— By Filipe P. Rizal, Translated by Gao Lang</p>
<p>Farewell, my beloved land; Land beloved by the sun; Pearl of the Eastern Sea; Our lost Eden! With joy I give you my sad life, Which was once so bright, so happy, and so strong, For your sake, I am willing to dedicate my life to you.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, without regret, Men fight madly on the battlefield, Dedicating their lives to you, but what is around them! Are they pine trees, laurel trees, or water lilies, Guillotines or vast nations, Resistance or cruel martyrdom, Anyway, it's all the same, It was to save the country and family.</p>
<p>When I die, From the day of the Advent of Jesus shrouded in black, Watch the declaration of the flying sky. It is in need of purple to color its dawn, Here is my blood; I happily shed it for it, As long as it can be plated with the light of rebirth.</p>
<p>My fantasy is just a child, At that time, it was a vibrant youth, Forever looking at you, Jewel of the Eastern Sea, Your black eyes are dry, You raised your happy face, And your pure and flawless glory.</p>
<p>My life's fantasy! My fervent worry! Calling to my departing soul, Oh, cheers! For the sake of dedicating to your future This is a glorious death; For the sake of dedicating your life to die; To die under your sky; To lie permanently in your loving embrace.</p>
<p>How many days later, you will find on my grave A lonely and humble flower, Touch it between the dense leaves, Put it on your lips, Kissing my soul. Let me feel my forehead Under the cool tombstone and your warm and cordial breath.</p>
<p>Let the gentle and quiet moonlight watch over me; Let the dawn unfold its brilliant splendor; Let the wind wail its solemn lament. Let the birds fly down to rest on my cross, Let it announce a song of peace on it.</p>
<p>Let the scorching sun melt the dew, Radiating from the blank space of the notes of my song. Let friendly people grieve my premature death, Praying in the tranquil twilight, Oh, dear country! You must also pray to God for me.</p>
<p>Pray for all those nameless victims; For the unequal suffering they endured; For our sad and impoverished mothers; For widows and orphans; For the tortured criminals; Also pray for yourself to possibly obtain final redemption.</p>
<p>When the shadows of night cover the cemetery, Look at those lonely dead left behind, Do not disturb their rest, Nor disturb their mystery. You must listen to a kind of string sound, This is me, beloved country, I sing for you.</p>
<p>When my grave is completely forgotten, There is no sign of the cross and the stele, Let the farmer sow on its mound; And my ashes will become the dust of your land before they are completely burned.</p>
<p>After that, if you abandon me, Forget me, I don't mind. I will pass through your air, gaps, and valleys. I will ring in your eardrum, A clear sound; Fragrant, color, language, song, A sigh, eternally repeating my faithful elements.</p>
<p>My worshipful country, My sorrowful sorrow! My beloved Filipinos! Listen to my most repeated farewell. I leave all of them and you; My fathers and lovers. The place I am going to has no slaves, no tyrants, no executioners; There is faith not death; There is the place where God reigns.</p>
<p>Farewell, fathers, brothers, I drew a line with the water of life! Childhood friends who lost their homes, Thank you, I am going to rest from that tiring day. Farewell, friendly strangers, my friends, my joy, Farewell, the people I love. Death is rest.</p>
<p>Note: Jose Rizal was the great national hero of the Philippines, physicist, scientist, economist, novelist, and poet. On December 30, 1896, he was executed by the Spanish authorities in Manila. And his death also triggered the Philippines to begin resisting Spain. This poem was written a few hours before he was executed.</p>
<h3>The Low Tide of Aoyuan</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Although paper is scarce in Vienna, various periodicals are still published. The publications with various covers make people not know what to buy. Music, drama, literature, politics, fashion, all kinds of publications are countless. Although Austria's film industry has only produced one film after the war, about ten film publications have been published.</p>
<p>Newspapers serialize long novels, and writers try their best to avoid words such as "war," "fascism," and "politics." They would rather take Johann Strauss's comfortable days and "pleasant old Vienna" as the background. The long serials published in each issue of the weekly "Storyteller" always have a murder or adultery. Low-level unconsciousness, which is the characteristic of Viennese novels, is called "fried chicken literature" (Brathuhn-iterature) by democratic people, because it appeals to the stomach, not to the heart or the brain.</p>
<p>Recently, fascists prevented the growth of Viennese students, and Austrian democrats plastered the city with propaganda slogans. On the wall was a Hitler-like soldier—a young man with only empty eye sockets of a corpse. It said: "Mothers, fight against those who want your children to learn to be like them."</p>
<p>This is a propaganda painting against fascism. Now, of course, they are hiding, but their oppressed and extinct influence still exists in Austrian life, and their shadows also sweep over literature.</p>
<p>The Vienna court is now trying the fascist writer Jeluslc. Sitting below is a blank face. In the past, Jeluslc was a strong supporter of the "Anschluss" and a radical propagandist. His novels add love to history, and Caesar is written to resemble Hitler.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this person corrupted the souls of young people and is also a national shame, but the judge wants to reinstate this filthy guest. A Viennese professor said to his students: "Unfortunately, Jeluslc's works cannot be republished now, but one day history will judge who is right in this dispute."</p>
<p>Austrian fascists cannot openly promote their ideas now. But they always try their best to pull back the Austrian people who are going along the road of democracy.</p>
<p>This is a disabled century. Nine out of ten children do not know Tolstoy, Jack London, or Romain Rolland, or even Moyne Reid or Fenimore Cooper. All works from democratic countries are prohibited. Children's literature from Dickens to Mark Twain has been replaced by Karl May's endless novels, who is a colonialist.</p>
<p>The book market is full of fried chicken literature, which means more than just business. People cannot openly publish Nazi literature now, so they have to publish mystery stories and crime stories. They hope that this kind of spiritual food can prevent dangerous thoughts. They are interested in ordinary crimes and no longer bother with the crimes of the Hitlerites.</p>
<p>A large number of American crime films also poured in. The French autumn salon of 1940 brought Vienna still Picasso, Matisse and those old people. Among them was a faint French resistance to German bloody tears. Besides being packed in wooden frames, nothing can be seen. The paintings seem to be painted casually at any time.</p>
<p>A female student at the University of Vienna wanted to study Zola, but was also prohibited. It is said that Zola was a supporter of the Dreyfus affair, and his opposition to the pastor was excessive. Many famous works, such as Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Goethe, Heine, Schiller, and Gogol's works, were published by a bookstore in a set of "Eternal Language" (Evige Wort), and such books were also prohibited.</p>
<p>There are also quite thoughtful writers in Austria, but there are too few such writers. Let's take two people as examples below:</p>
<p>Frank Tsokor recently wrote a dramatic poem called Calypso. During the Hitler era, he moved to Dalmatia. He used the ancient mythology of Odyssey to express his thoughts and illustrate the poet's responsibility to the country. This is a sincere work, and the idea is of the times. But few people pay attention, and only the intellectual class is slightly affected. His neglect is a common phenomenon in modern Austria. In the era of fascist rule, only culture builders who destroy genius exist. The merchants who sell filth, such as Jeluslc, laid a thick net, controlling the entire spiritual life of Austria. They still hate genius and everything progressive to this day.</p>
<p>Bleichsteiner refused to compile a Caucasus dictionary for the use of Hitler's army during the German occupation. He was expelled from the university, and even now he cannot hold a professorship. He is an enemy of the fascists and has translated many works by Soviet writers. This is enough for the Austrian people to oppose him. Mr. Bai said unhappily: "I love my country very much, but in today's atmosphere, it is difficult to study literature." He is right. Although fascism is hidden in Austria, it has not put down its weapons. In Austria, it is still very difficult to develop loyal democratic art and honest popular literature.</p>
<h3>"Bright as Lotus Emerging from Waves"</h3>
<p>— Jin Shan</p>
<h3>Casual Feelings of a Trip to England</h3>
<p>— Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived in England, I wanted to visit the world-famous university cities—Oxford University and Cambridge University. This eagerness was like the drunk Lu Zhishen going down the mountain, not seeing anything else, but already looking at the village with the "wine" flag hanging high, with the same interest and spirit. What's more, it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and we chose this uniquely Chinese poetic festival to visit famous cities; it can't be said that it was an unplanned trip. I remember one evening in the autumn of 1945, several yellow-faced foreign guests in a London apartment discovered and confirmed that the day after tomorrow was the Mid-Autumn Festival. Brother W suggested, why not go to Cambridge, which has the scenery of Jiangnan, for a trip? So he immediately called several travel companions who came with him, and agreed to meet at the Poddinton subway station on the first train tomorrow morning. Our group of five, with Master Yao being the oldest, was very happy to chant poems with Brother Rui during the journey. Brother Cheng, who had been in England for many years, was of course the most qualified guide. I was temporarily asked to be the accountant, so I proposed the method of "non-accounting accountant," which is to ask each travel companion to prepay a certain amount of pounds, and I would gather them in a money bag, which would be regarded as the "public money bag." All expenses during the journey would be taken from the public money bag. Every night, I would check all the money in the public money bag, and if I found it insufficient, I would ask each travel companion to replenish it at any time. This would continue every day until the end of the trip, and then I would take out the money left in the public money bag and distribute it evenly. They said that I didn't forget to train during the trip, which was the "credit" in group life, quite smart. In fact, I was afraid of trivial accounting, and it could also be said that I was lazy.</p>
<p>Oxford University is located in the city of Oxford on the upper reaches of the Thames River. There are more than thirty independent colleges in the university, each with its own independent organization, with classrooms, dormitories, and grand classrooms. The day we visited was a Sunday, so the whole city was filled with the sound of church bells. Each college has its own private road to the Oxford River. There are small docks by the river for boating, and the weeping willows are as beautiful as the West Lake in China. Cambridge University has more than twenty independent colleges, distributed in the city of Cambridge. The city straddles the Cam River, and all the bridges and school buildings are antique. Each college also has a courtyard road leading to the small dock on the Cam River, surrounded by green grass, which not only serves as the only natural sports field for students, but is actually the necessary natural environment for academic research. As for the beauty and charm of the scenery, there is no difference from Oxford University, and they can complement each other!</p>
<p>In London, it is rare to see willows hanging in small bridges and flowing water. Only in the two university districts of Oxford and Cambridge, countless weeping willows and a long, narrow river deeply embrace a green meadow, forming an ideal environment for young men and women to study and relax. We visited the research institutes of the two universities and learned that they do not adopt the American credit system, but focus on personality cultivation, and the guidance of teachers and the learning of students. They are conducted in individual contact and conversations. Students start an academic research, which is constantly planned and gradually improved in the conversations of various professors. Therefore, the student's personality and character are thoroughly understood by the professor, and how to promote the student's research must be solved in the process of personality cultivation. This is the characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. As for university professors, each department has a fixed number. If a full professor does not leave, an associate professor can never be promoted to a full professor. There are many old teachers with white hair and beards, whose academic research has been well-known at home and abroad, but nominally they are still lecturers or associate professors. Just because there is no vacancy for a full professor. We lived in London for more than two months and felt the trouble of metropolitan life. This short trip to Oxford and Cambridge, because it has weeping willows and green willows, and fragrant grass, in this poetic and picturesque environment with suitable sunny and rainy weather, everyone's poetic inspiration burst forth. Brother Rui improvised:</p>
<p>"The grass is fresh on the long embankment after the rain, the west wind still likes the willows like smoke, a sound of oars counts the rows of herons, instructing the waves not to ask the year."</p>
<p>After reading it, I still yearn for it. The world-famous university city with Jiangnan scenery can attract tens of millions of young students!</p>
<h3>Flowing Water</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>The journey is long, accompanied by loneliness.</p>
<p>A stone, a blade of grass, may have stirred up a whirlpool, splashed up foam, but hurry, hurry on the distant road of life, the whirlpool is gone, the foam is hidden, it is a boundless road, without end, and no one knows.</p>
<p>Flowing water may give you wisdom, because it hopes that you will enlighten the mystery of life.</p>
<p>Life is always in a hurry, maybe poets are praising, maybe painters are depicting, but who can know the anger it accumulates? Look, crash, the flowing water is angry, the flowing water is laughing, although it still can't linger on this beautiful scenery, it still has to hurry on its way.</p>
<p>Without a goal, without likes or dislikes, just following the power of nature, striving to run, in the universe, is there a more boring and monotonous life than this? I am also angry for the flowing water, I am also indignant for the flowing water; however, besides sympathy, where can I send endless words?</p>
<p>Flowing water, you will one day be magnificent, your history will be incomparably brilliant! Flowing water!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 519</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Our China has been a land of culture and etiquette since ancient times; it is a pity that only a group of truly cultured people have always been brutally suppressed and oppressed by some autocratic demon kings, who have used all kinds of despicable means to prevent them from developing; for their own selfish interests, they have made the entire nation corrupt. Since the opening of the sea ban, it has been constantly hit by external pressure, so that those who only have a superficial understanding of Western culture look down on our country's old culture, and those who are older in mind say that this group of young people are too Westernized, and therefore are unwilling to change their thinking. This is the situation in China at this stage..."</p>
<p>"However, the essence of the Chinese national race is not as inferior as the Westerners publicize; at present, it is only standing at the intersection of the new and the old, wandering and hesitating, losing the national heritage for a while, and failing to grasp the true essence of the new. However, there is no need to be pessimistic; as long as it is pulled onto a great road, it will progress quickly, and it will definitely be able to walk to the front and lead this era. Although our Bairenzhuang group is small, it is now determined to adhere to this purpose and is walking in this direction."</p>
<p>"You don't seem to be carrying any weapons." Hejian turned his face and looked at Shouyi.</p>
<p>"I don't like to use that thing very much, unless the situation is too serious..." Shouyi held the helm, paid attention to the route, and replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"What if it becomes serious and you need it temporarily?" Hejian asked curiously.</p>
<p>"If it is serious, there must be more people on the other side, and more weapons; if needed, I can borrow one from them."</p>
<p>"Them,"</p>
<p>"The other side." Shouyi explained.</p>
<p>"Risking flying bullets to grab it?" Hejian recalled the two scenes of Xiao Laohu and Zi Shan snatching guns.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily so desperately..."</p>
<p>"I think it's always a dangerous thing... Masters who have practiced Chinese boxing are certainly quick-handed and quick-eyed; however, if they encounter an agile opponent with accurate shooting, and the two sides are a considerable distance apart, I'm afraid it won't be so easy to talk." Hejian thought that the two times Hucheng and Zishan got guns were both performances, and the actual confrontation would probably not be so satisfactory.</p>
<p>"The way and speed of movement are too different between those who have practiced and those who have not. From the eyes of those who have practiced, the movements of those who have not practiced are like the 'slow motion' in scientific films... unbearably slow."</p>
<p>"What if the other party has also practiced, and is also a shooting expert?" Hejian was still a little distrustful.</p>
<p>"People who have practiced, and are highly skilled, don't like to carry weapons very much; especially things like pistols. Our Zhuang is now adhering to this 'morality,' that is, even if they seize a weapon, unless the other party is an utterly evil fellow, it is difficult to use the weapon to hurt people."</p>
<h3>Nocturne</h3>
<p>— Tang Kuangying</p>
<p>Loneliness</p>
<p>Pouring strong wine into a bitter cup, weeds grow in barren fields, and people sigh and regret its fate.</p>
<p>A daffodil grows by a dry pond, swaying in the wind. A poet walks past him indifferently, stopping under a small peach tree, carefully breaking off a branch with great pity, and offering it in a bottle on his desk. He wrote many touching poems for this little peach.</p>
<p>Soon, the little peach withered, and he was thrown on the side of the road by the owner with pity; looking back at the daffodil by the small pond, it was still swaying in the wind.</p>
<p>Who says that pouring sweet wine into a bitter cup is enough to regret, and that weeds growing in barren fields is loneliness.</p>
<p>Night Rain</p>
<p>It's night rain again.</p>
<p>The sound of rain stopped slightly, and I don't know who is singing a sad song in a low voice; looking out the window, it is all black, not allowing you to have a little hope.</p>
<p>The person listening to the song and the person singing the song are both annoyed by the night rain and sleepless through the dry and lonely feelings.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Hero Worship Desire</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>—Also on Munich People Making a "Hitler Fortune"—</p>
<p>But, tomorrow, who will pick up a heavy story?</p>
<p>A certain Western philosopher said: "There are no heroes in front of servants." The meaning of this sentence is: the distance between the servant and the master is too small. The master may be arrogant and invincible outside, but when he returns home, he will inevitably be decadent and sad, and even shed tears at the autumn wind. Sometimes, gentlemen may also show ugliness in front of maids, forgetting the solemn appearance during the day. Sometimes, a hero who is accustomed to dressing himself in gorgeous clothes, when he takes off his clothes and is served by servants for bathing, will inevitably show a thin shape and lose the cover of gorgeousness. The Roman Emperor Nero under the pen of the Polish Henryk Sienkiewicz, and Napoleon under the pen of Japanese novelists, both appear quite embarrassed in front of servants. This is definitely not the fantasy of writers, but a possible fact. Naturally, only great philosophers and great heroes who are consistent inside and outside will not cover up their weaknesses with hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Gogol wrote in "Dead Souls" that Chichikov looked in the mirror and made various faces to appreciate his "flattery." This is an excellent photograph. Looking at Chichikov's private life from the keyhole is more informative about his personality than seeing Chichikov's pretentious behavior at a grand banquet. The keyhole is Gogol's secret weapon to subdue certain heroes, his great invention, and its power is perhaps no less than the atomic bomb in the eyes of "heroes" who are good at posing.</p>
<p>There is a considerable distance between heroes and mortals. Because of this distance, it is difficult for ordinary people to see heroes clearly. The British Thomas Carlyle said: "The desire for hero worship is also a remnant of human barbarity." This is indeed a penetrating remark, but I feel there is a need for supplementation. In my opinion, the more vigorous the desire for hero worship, the deeper the servility of the nation may be. The general public has a low level of knowledge, no confidence in themselves, or is accustomed to comforting themselves with fantasies, so they can only place their hopes on gods and heroes. In history, many great men have been smeared with color by historians, the reason being that historians want to satisfy their own fantasies and deceive themselves.</p>
<p>Strangely, great heroes are certainly worshiped, but arch-criminals are also viewed differently by people. As the saying goes, in the eyes of ordinary people, success is king, failure is a bandit, there is no such thing as good or evil, as long as it is "big" is good, positive and negative are not counted. The recent Munich people's big Hitler fortune is an example.</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, Munich, where Hitler rose to prominence, has recently seen many forged relics. "Hitler's personally used pipe and watch" can be found on the black market. Recently, at least twenty-four pipes and nine watches have been bought at a high price of one thousand marks each? Americans seem to have a great interest in Hitler and often buy things randomly. In fact, "Hitler never smoked or loved watches during his lifetime."</p>
<p>Isn't this obvious enough? The distance in space plus the distance in time makes many people "look at Hitler differently," so although he is a Nazi demon king, he has after all massacred tens of millions of innocent people, and is also great and quite valuable. Once this desire for hero worship takes hold, it is a small matter that Americans' wallets are getting thinner; it is very terrible to make the general public re-evaluate the atrocities of the Nazis, and even think that Hitler is no less than a "failed hero," and encourage German youth to learn from his example.</p>
<h3>"Please Take Professional Course" of Gifts</h3>
<p>— Yamaguchi</p>
<p>An Irishman invited his friend to his wedding anniversary and told his friend how to find his room in the apartment. He said: "Go to the seventh floor, and when you see the door with the letter D, push the button with your elbow. When the door opens, push it open with your foot."</p>
<p>"Why do I have to use my elbow and foot?" his friend asked puzzled.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God!" the Irishman shouted: "Of course you won't come empty-handed, will you?"</p>
<h3>Che Le in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Suiren</p>
<p>Since the twenty-first, all entertainment venues in Hangzhou have been closed. Because the Qiaoxihu Movie Theater was destroyed by soldiers twice, and the Maggie and Jincheng theaters were also beaten one after another, some suffered heavy losses and could not resume business, and some felt that business was too insecure and were unwilling to open their doors. In order to express their support, even Peking opera, Yue opera, and miscellaneous operas were all closed. Each entertainment venue had a sign at the door that read "Following the consensus of the industry association, all businesses will be closed from today."</p>
<p>This situation is really very serious. I remember that in the former Qing Dynasty, wherever Che Le was unilaterally enforced, it meant that a major funeral was taking place in the area, and the people expressed their condolences. Otherwise, why would all entertainment venues in the city be closed?</p>
<p>I occasionally got two chapters of vulgar sentences, thinking to mourn for Hangzhou, which stopped entertainment.</p>
<p>"Theaters are closed door to door, and there is much discussion in long and short streets.</p>
<p>Soldiers strike to pacify the world, and Che Le's mourning is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Entertainment merchants are worried about each other, and the songs and dances of the West Lake are temporarily suspended. The wind drives away idlers, and watching operas is now not free."</p>
<h3>Duke Huan of Qi's Divorce</h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Couples quarrel to find happiness," there is nothing serious about it. Between husband and wife, there should be finding happiness, and even quarreling is a kind of finding happiness. However, the world cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Han Feizi said:</p>
<p>"The daughter of Cai was the wife of Duke Huan. Duke Huan rode in a boat with her, and the lady swayed the boat, Duke Huan was very afraid, forbade her but could not stop her, and angrily drove her out. Then he summoned her again, and then remarried her. Duke Huan was very angry and was about to attack Cai. Zhongfu advised him: 'The play on the bed is not enough to attack the country of others, and achievements cannot be expected. Please do not use this as a reason.'"</p>
<p>Originally, the wife was trying to find happiness for her husband, but as a result, they got divorced, and even had to fire at her family. Fortunately, Guan Zhong persuaded him to stop. It is not very elegant to say that attacking Cai is an excuse for his wife to find happiness.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the beginning of the war can also be caused by the "play on the bed." The wars in history, when explained, have their inevitable principles, but such causes, such as turning their faces and not recognizing relatives, are quite interesting.</p>
<p>Han Feizi wrote well. In the short passage quoted above, he wrote that Duke Huan was "very afraid," "angrily drove her out," and then "very angry," layer by layer, his attitude was vivid. He depicted the living face of the first hegemon of the Spring and Autumn Period.</p>
<p>This story shows that both Duke Huan and Lady Cai have some psychological abnormalities. In modern terms, Lady Cai probably has a bit of sadomasochistic tendency, while Duke Huan has a neurotic desire for control. His sense of dignity and authority is slightly frustrated, and he becomes angry.</p>
<p>It is not easy to describe these two kinds of personalities. They are rarely seen in works of art. There is an old Russian novel that describes a man with a sadomasochistic tendency who calls a prostitute to strip naked in the snow and beats her severely, naturally paying her money. The latter, with Charlie Chaplin's portrayal of Hitler, grasps it most uniquely.</p>
<p>I often think: Hitler or Mussolini, when addressing the crowd with wide eyes and sticking out his chin, would never use that expression to deal with his mistress, right? Because this is "human nature," looking at Duke Huan of Qi, I feel that it cannot be generalized. However, this is probably also human nature.</p>
<h3>Story of Fearing Foreigners</h3>
<p>— From Yunjian</p>
<p>After the Gengzi year (1900) of the late Qing dynasty, the policy changed from anti-foreign to pro-foreign. The power of foreign churches became extremely influential, leading to the saying, "The common people fear officials, and officials fear foreigners." During that time, Geng Gongda from Yunjian was intelligent and resourceful. He served as the Circuit Intendant of western Yunnan. In one of the subordinate counties, some unscrupulous people, relying on the power of the church, forcibly occupied people's land. The county government did not dare to make a decision. Geng personally interrogated them, but the unscrupulous people, feeling secure, insulted the official. Geng was enraged and had them detained. The next day, a letter arrived from a priest, siding with the unscrupulous people and requesting their release. Geng resumed the court session, brought in the unscrupulous people, showed them the priest's letter, slammed the table, and scolded loudly: "You rely on the power of the priest. I can give up my official position, but I cannot let you go unpunished!" He then tore the priest's letter into pieces and threw them into the air. The unscrupulous people were returned to custody. The next morning, the priest arrived at the office in a sedan chair, requesting an audience. The priest was furious and loudly said to Geng, "I requested the release of a church member, but you not only refused, but also tore my letter! This is an insult! If there is no appropriate solution, I will report this to the consul for serious negotiation." Geng then said, "Please sit down, Father, why are you angry? That church member is cunning and hateful, bullying good people on a daily basis and committing all kinds of evil. Even with your letter, the decision to approve or deny is in my hands. Why would I tear the letter? I have been an official for many years, how could I act rashly like this?" He then took out the original letter from the priest and showed it to him. He further said, "That church member is not only deceiving the officials, but also deceiving the priest, causing you to trouble yourself early in the morning. I feel very uneasy. That church member must be severely punished. Does the Father agree?" The priest was speechless and repeatedly said, "Yes, yes." After the unscrupulous people were severely punished, the church members no longer dared to act recklessly. In reality, what Geng tore was not the priest's letter, but a cover for a cooking pot.</p>
<h3>American Legal Aid Society for Common People</h3>
<p>— Renqi</p>
<p>According to a report: The local Bar Association will organize a "Legal Aid Committee for Common People" to represent common people in court or provide legal arguments, etc. It is said. This kind of organization is still a novelty in China, but it was established in Chicago, USA seven years ago, and the results have been remarkable.</p>
<p>Ordinary people, including those in America, are always confused when legal disputes arise and allow things to develop until they become serious and irreparable before seeking advice from a lawyer. This is because they do not understand the procedures for hiring a lawyer on the one hand, and they worry about the high costs on the other. Nearly three-quarters of matters are resolved without obtaining legal advice, and many people suffer losses as a result. Several lawyers in Chicago with a strong sense of public service, recognizing this, planned to organize an advisory lawyer association and asked the Chicago Bar Association to support it. The aim was to enable ordinary people in need of legal advice to obtain the services of a qualified lawyer to handle their cases at a very low cost. The association has one secretary who is permanently stationed in the association to solve problems or introduce lawyers. Its office is always crowded, with forty or fifty people visiting every day for help. The secretary himself is a lawyer, and most inquiries are resolved by him in a few words without the need to consult other lawyers. This service is free of charge. If a lawyer is needed to handle the case, the secretary will assign one from the registered lawyers. The client only needs to pay a consultation fee of three US dollars to discuss everything. If other services are needed, the fees are also very low. The association has three hundred registered lawyers, including several famous lawyers in Chicago, who handle ordinary civil lawsuits, criminal lawsuits, tax lawsuits, and labor lawsuits according to their respective expertise.</p>
<p>Since the association was established in Chicago, similar organizations have been established in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, New York, and other places. It is expected that a national organization will be established soon.</p>
<p>Some people worry that this convenience will cultivate the habit of litigation among the people, but based on the situation in Chicago, this concern is purely unnecessary. Most of those seeking help only need some advice and common sense. Based on this knowledge, they can avoid the trouble of legal disputes. People who do evil can also be deterred by the increase in people's legal knowledge. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Legal Aid Committee for Common People, which will be established in this city, can also help the common people as much as possible, uphold justice, reduce people's losses, and give full play to the lawyers' high efficiency. This would be fortunate for the common people and fortunate for society. (This article is taken from the American Magazine "Zhi Yue" Issue)</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>An old man with hunched shoulders slowly crawled out of a pile of rubble. From twenty or thirty yards away, he pointed at Lao Zhu with a trembling finger. His eyes were staring straight ahead, and he stumbled step by step, his feet seeming weak and his body constantly swaying.</p>
<p>The aimless cursing had unexpectedly caused trouble, which made Lao Zhu feel somewhat disturbed and very surprised.</p>
<p>"No, old man, I wasn't cursing you!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Is that Little Lin? Yes! It's you!" As he got closer, Lao Zhu realized that the person wasn't old. It was just that his face was covered in dust, his beard and hair were disheveled, and his spirit was particularly weak, so he looked like an old man from a distance. His eyes were not only staring straight ahead but also covered in bloodshot veins, as if he were drunk. He didn't seem to hear Lao Zhu's explanation and suddenly changed his tone, opening his arms and staggering straight towards him.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhu Zhaonian had clearly seen that he was a madman, but he wasn't afraid. He still looked him up and down, and he noticed that the clothes the man was wearing, although dirty now, were made of the finest materials, and his pair of unlaced yellow leather shoes were still in the Shanghai style.</p>
<p>"Little Lin! Do you want gold? Speak up! Speak up!" The madman gradually approached and grabbed Lao Zhu's shoulders with both hands, shaking him violently. "Don't hesitate, I know that what you want is gold!"</p>
<p>"Sir, wake up! I'm not Little Lin, you need to wake up!" Zhu Zhaonian gently moved his hands away, raising his voice to shout at him, but his face remained kind and lifeless.</p>
<p>The madman suddenly laughed, but he laughed so miserably that Lao Zhu couldn't bear to look at him.</p>
<p>"Little Lin, you're angry! Aren't you?" He patted Lao Zhu's shoulder forcefully and said, "That's right, I'm sorry for you! You asked to borrow an ounce of gold, and I wouldn't even give it to you. But, Little Lin, I'll tell you!" He suddenly lowered his voice, looking extremely secretive. "Gold is really a good thing, our lives depend on it to be preserved. Paper money is useless; when the dynasty changes, it's worthless. Gold is different, it's shiny, heavy, valuable to the Chinese, and valuable to the Japanese! Hahaha!" Then he burst into wild laughter again. "With gold, you can escape! Right? Little Lin."</p>
<p>"Then, sir, haven't you already escaped to Jinchengjiang?" Lao Zhu couldn't bear to tease him, but he finally couldn't help but ask this rhetorical question.</p>
<p>New Knowledge</p>
<h3>New Type of American Camera</h3>
<p>Ray, manager and head of the research department of Polaroid Corporation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has recently invented a new type of camera. After the shutter is pressed, the camera can complete the procedures of developing and fixing within fifty seconds, and print a perfect positive image photograph and a negative film. The camera is equipped with a roll of film and a roll of printing paper at both ends. When a certain scene is captured by the lens, rotating the film and printing paper in the camera will press them tightly together. At the same time, the chemical agent pod attached to the printing paper roll will break due to the pressure of the roll, causing the agent to spread on the printing paper and start developing and fixing. Then, the film and printing paper will go through the knife cutting process installed in the machine, and then be built into a combined piece of paper, which will slide out of the machine. After this combined piece of paper is separated, it will become a positive image photograph and a negative film.</p>
<p>The figure shows the inventor of the new camera, Mr. Schroeder, and his positive image and film. The image completes all photography procedures within fifty seconds. The attached diagram on the right shows the new camera and device, and explains how the various steps in photography can be completed quickly within fifty seconds. (US Information Agency)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Hirohito</h3>
<p>— Bosheng</p>
<p>The "Constitution of Japan" was implemented on May 3rd, with Article 1 stipulating that "the Emperor is the symbol of the State of Japan" rather than a special kind. MacArthur's intention is the same as the opinion of Japanese constitutional experts that this provision is in line with the people's livelihood. However, the Japanese people are becoming more and more respectful of this symbol!</p>
<p>Hirohito, learning "democracy", received Japanese reporters on May 2nd and made direct questions and answers. This is an unprecedented event. However, the questions asked by the Japanese reporters are of no great importance, and Hirohito's answers are certainly not about "military plans"!</p>
<p>April 29th was Hirohito's forty-sixth birthday, the so-called "Tencho-setsu" by the Japanese. This year, the symbolic birthday celebration means that everyone has a day off, but the newspapers did not publish a picture of the Emperor, which is slightly different from the scenes in previous years.</p>
<p>Hirohito's current life is simple and quiet, and he is trying his best to maintain his health. Except for Sundays, he starts working at 9 am every day. His weight is now 140 pounds. He has quit smoking and drinking, and rarely contacts women. His only hobby is still studying plants.</p>
<p>Please note that Hirohito is now living the life of Goujian, enduring hardship and biding his time. Deep in his heart, isn't he thinking of Wu Fuchai!</p>
