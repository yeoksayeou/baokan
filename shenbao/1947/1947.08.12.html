<h3>魏特使一行抵台北　今邀台當局開圓桌會議　在台任務傳係計蕈練兵</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十一日電〕魏德邁特使所乘C54式三星專機，今午十二時十三分自京飛抵台北。魏使着　灰西服，於樂聲中下機，台省主席魏道明趨前與魏使握手，以示歡迎。美國駐台領事步雷克亦在機塲迎　。魏使於檢閱儀隊後，即由魏主席陪同乘車馳赴鬨山招待所休息。魏道明氏前任駐美大使時，即與魏德邁氏交誼甚深，今日兩氏同車抵達園山招待所後，即在二樓聚談良久，無他人在座。據特使團新聞顧問華生在機塲稱，該團預定留台二日，是否前往台省南部一行，刻尙未定。隨行之專家將分組搜集有關台省財政，工業及工程方面之資料。</p>
<p>〔合衆社廣州十一日電〕據美國權威方面十一日透露稱，魏德邁將軍目前訪問台灣之主要目的之一，在尋覓一訓練中國新兵之地位。此項練兵計劃諒由美國軍官所主持，該方面又指出，現在中國之一百五十名至二百名美軍官，乃訓練中國士兵之核心，一俟杜魯門總統及國會批准後，立即能予以擴大。又訊，台灣因交通便利，故爲理想之訓練士兵墓地。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北十一日電〕魏德邁特使及其團負十一日下午一時三刻，在美國駐台領事館舉行非正式會議聽取美領事步雷克之報吿，並由步雷克提供各項資料，三時接見此間英商怡和公司經理巴爾頓，聯總海地篇農業專家辛博萊，加拿大牧師迭克森及美國佛拉薩公司經理斯姆金四人，並由上述四人提供若干情報。三時三刻魏德　特使偕美領事步雷克驅車至台北賓館，回拜台主席魏道明及秘書長徐道鄰，記者曾見四氏圍坐於一方形桌前，敍談歷五十分鐘，魏使聽魏主席之談話並親作頗爲詳細之筆錄。此次談話中，記者但聞魏主席發言，魏　使僅偶提出數項詢問。步雷克氏亦僅偶作補充意見，徐道鄰氏則談話最少。四時半魏使辭出後，據徐道鄰氏向記者透露稱，此次談話內容，偏重于台省之一般政治情况，並未涉及其他方而。五時至七時，　使於美領事館舉行鷄尾酒會，招待此間政黨軍各機關首長，工商界代表及美國僑民。據新聞顧問畢生於酒會中答復記者之詢問稱：該團在華之任務僅爲搜集一切可以帮助明瞭「事實」之炎料，最後之決策，則須返抵美國後始可決定。記者詢問：「貴國來台之特別任務爲何」，華生答稱：「台灣乃中國之一省，其財政及經濟諸方面，皆受中國內陸之影響，一如遠東之情况皆受世界局勢之影嚮然。此次來台僅爲調查中國全部事實中之一部分，並無任何其他特別任務」。記者又詢：「魏特使對台灣之印象如何」？華生答稱：「尙談不上印象，吾人淮知工作」。今晚八時魏主席假台北賓館設宴款待出使及其團員，並激美領事步雷克，副領事費福德，新聞處長嘉刷及伙方各界人士約五十人作陪。據美領館發表消息稱：「魏使及其團員，定于十二日上午九時假台北招待所與魏主席及台省府各廳處畏舉行圓桌會議，明下午日程未定」。該項消息又稱，魏使將于十二日飛滬，並于本週末飛赴廣州。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕盛傳魏德邁此來將以鉅款貸華助我建設交通及建設塘沽新港一節，記者十一日以此詢諸交通部顧問凌士芬，承談魏氏此來，主要任務在調查事實，交部雖曾有詳細表册交渠，然其中所敍述者大都爲交通概况及未來建設計劃，並無任何借款要求。至美國助我建塘沽新港事，魏氏此次在北方時對該港確極感興趣，與我方人員談話時，對工款如此之少而從事如此鉅大工程，表示驚奇。記者詢渠報戰美建議將浙閩建成模範省，加强各該省份鐵路，公路建築，此說確否？凌氏稱，此說不確，惟上述省份交通事業正努力興建中，君等一閱地圖，即知浙閩交通溝通後、對內地物資之外運，將有何種便利，惟此類建設，不一定完全依賴外力。</p>

<h3>現任官吏辭職競選　選舉總所解釋兩點</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕選舉總事務所前曾爲現任官吏任所所在地曁管　區，以及官吏辭職日期之起算，擬具釋明意見，並經國府備案，茲誌　明全文如次：（一）現任官吏任所所在地及管轄區之釋明：</p>
<p>依國民大會代表選舉罷免法第八條規定，現任官吏不得於其任所所在地之選舉區當選爲國民大會代表，除官吏之範圍已經本所函請司怯院解釋外，至所謂任所所在塊之選舉區，擬即釋明爲「官署所在地之選舉區」，例如鎭江縣爲江蘇省國大代表選舉區之一，同時亦爲省縣政府之所在地，則凡經解釋應受限制之官吏，即均不得在鎭江選舉區內常選爲國民大會代表，蓋各官署之所在地雖可能均在鎭江縣城以內，然鎭江縣城固亦包括於整個鎭江選舉區之內也。</p>
<p>依立法院立法委員選舉罷免法第十三條規定，現任文職或軍職之官吏，於其管轄區或任所所在地之選舉區為候選人者，應於選舉期前五個月辭職，此一規定，除官　問題巳經司怯院解釋，任所所在地問題已見前項釋明外，所謂管轄區之選舉區，擬即釋明爲凡管轄區之地域，無諭其局部或全部已包括於某一選舉區範圍之內者，均應依法辭職後，始可參加該選舉區之競　　荒任所所在地範圍較狹，大都包括於管　區及選舉區之內，而此次立委選舉之劃分，有合併數行政督察區爲一選舉區者，有一行政督察區分屬於數個選舉區者，關係錯綜，勢必以選舉區爲主體，方較合理，例如安徽第二行政督察區轄六安，，合肥等六縣，現合肥劃入第一選舉區，六安等五縣劃入第三選舉區，則此專署以內之官吏，凡經解釋應受限制者，在安徽第一，三兩選舉區內，倘欲從事競選，遂均非辭職不可，因此條之立法原意，在防止其利用職權操縱選舉，雖在第一選舉區內僅有合肥一縣爲其管轄區域，但立委選舉旣係以區爲單位，自未仲劃出某某一縣不任其從事活動，事實上亦不能認其在某某一縣所得之票皆爲利用權力操縱而來，遂均爲無效也，准此釋明”，其不分區之省市，凡應受限制之官吏，如欲在本省競選，亦必先期辭職。</p>
<p>（二）官吏辭職日期起算之釋明：</p>
<p>依立怯院立法委員選舉罷免法第十三條規定，現任文聯或軍職之官吏，於其管轄區域或其任所所在地之選舉區爲候選人者，應於選舉期前五個月辭職，此項辭職日期之起算原則，自應以核准之日爲準，惟本屆立法委員選舉，規定期限僅六個月，而選舉日期至遲須爲選務辦理完畢之前一個月，是在開始辦理選務之時即行辭職，其五個月之期間已不易扣足，若必待核准而後始予計算，則辭呈批答，公牘往還，累月經旬，均非意外，是此項辭職人員實已無參加競選之機會，似非立法之初意，爲顧全事實起見，在本屆選舉，對此問題，擬即釋明爲自辭呈提出之日起算，其提出辭職日期，並須由其主官官以機關名義電達主管選所，倘經慰留，應以再提辭呈之日計算，再提辭呈之日如距選舉日期己不足五個月時，其辭職應爲無效。</p>

<h3>我國鐵路建設五年計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報十一日南京航訊〕我國戰後第一期五年鐵路建設計劃，已經擬定。所有路綫之選擇，均着重於本部與邊區各省主要政治中心之連絡，軍事重鎭之鞏固，民主經濟之促進以及重工業區域之重之。至於有蘭國防之路綫中，海防鐵路與陸防鐵路並重，惟在不遠背國家安全之原則下，鐵路路綫均設法與重要海港取得聯繋。</p>
<p>關於鐵路路綫建築程序，在我國工業化未達預定目標以前，應先注重本部各省主要幹綫之完成，次及西北高原各次要路綫，最後始行加密各路聯絡綫。</p>
<p>我國現有鐵路，共爲二七·〇八四公里，其中東北佔一一·三三〇公里，關內佔一四·五五四公里。台灣佔一·二〇〇公里。故第一期五年建設內，不擬在東北及台灣加建鐵路，擬在內地各省新建鐵路一四·三三一公里。</p>
<p>擬建各綫，又可分爲西北·西南·東南三大系統：</p>
<p>西北系統</p>
<p>西北系統爲陝·甘寗·靑·新五省交通系統，將來可再由哈密展築至迪化·中　　樹展築至拉薩，此區交通在包頭及潼關　與比較工業化之華北銜接，以天津·靑　·海州·漢口爲其國際經濟吐納之門戶　南連富有工業化資格之四川，爲西北與西南物產交流之脈詻，又本系統之蘭州包頭綫，經過一千六百餘萬畝之河套灌溉區。</p>
<p>西南系統</p>
<p>本案統爲川·黔·滇·桂四省交通系統，以開發川西工業，貴州水城鐵礦及聯絡富有工業化資格之四川·湖南為特點。其國際經濟吐納門戶，除原有長江水通及滇越鐵路外，加關廣州灣，廣州及緬邊等處。至桂省與珠江流域之交通，則可由西江經梧州接三水，又可由柳州經賀縣至三水之綫聯接。又，現任參謀次長劉斐將軍曾主張由柳州至韶關建一直達綫，將來施工時，仍可研究決定。</p>
<p>東南系統</p>
<p>本系統爲浙。贛。閩三省及粵省東部交通系統。打通贛江，閩江·珠江·錢塘江四水系，以深水港之厦門爲其國際經濟主要吐納港，由南京經歙縣·貴溪·南平·漳平梅縣而至廣州，形成一沿海綫，實為此系統之脊椎，東南礦產雖少，而農產尙富，人口亦稠，此四水系位向相背，經濟交流最缺。茲從其分水背脊全行打通，對於東南經濟之發展，將有極大之促進力。</p>
<p>另有其他綫四條·其功用如下：</p>
<p>（一）開封濟南綫：此綫意義，在使華中區可與靑島直接聯繫。</p>
<p>（二）囊陽花園綫：此綫局部意義，雖爲漢水流域通外捷徑，但其延長綫，或由紫荊關入關中，或越大巴山入川，均有全局意義，惟延長綫尙待測定。</p>
<p>（三）長治淸化綫：經豐富煤區，並成晋省通南部捷徑，此爲現任資委會委員長翁文灝氏所提儀之綫。</p>
<p>（四）承德赤峯通遼綫：雖爲熱省內部綫，但為避開沿海而入東北之重要綫。</p>
<p>以上所選路綫，其優點為先求在地形上易通，且均以發達經濟促進工業化為第一義，同時並兼顯國防上需要。</p>
<p>邊疆五綫</p>
<p>在上述各綫中，有伸向邊疆之綫五條，其營業收入，一時頗難發達，當在意料中，但決不能因此不認爲其無建築之價值，此五綫共長三·六九二公里，計：</p>
<p>蘭州至哈密綫：一、六三六公里</p>
<p>蘭州至西賓綫：二五〇公里</p>
<p>西寗至玉樹綫：八〇〇公里</p>
<p>集山至康　綫：四〇六公里</p>
<p>承德至通　綫；六〇〇公里</p>
<p>五年程序</p>
<p>此五年建設計劃、預計每年完成之路綫如下：</p>
<p>第一年，開始建築六、二〇六公里。</p>
<p>第二年，開始建築三、三二六公里，建築中之里數自六、二〇六公里增加爲九、五三二公里，是年成二、八一二公里。</p>
<p>第三年，開始建築三、九一七公里，建築中之里數增加爲一〇、六三七公里，是年完成七七三公里。</p>
<p>第四年，開始建築八八二公里，建築中之里數增加爲一〇、七四六公里，是年完成之里數爲二、八六五公里。</p>
<p>第五年，完成七、八八一公里。即達到一四、三三一公里之目標。</p>
<p>工款估計</p>
<p>關於建築費之佔計，除已測量之綫，按其測量報吿內之工程數量，估計工款外，所有未測量之綫，則依其地形比照已測之綫，估計工款。</p>
<p>以戰前（即民國廿六年）物價標準計算，一四、三三一公里鐵路，共需國幣一十四億六千〇三十五萬六千元，合美金（美金折合國幣爲卅比一百）四億九千八百一十四萬七千元。</p>
<p>關於將綫建築時，所需職員及工人，計：</p>
<p>高中低三級技術人員，共二萬七千〇九十四人。</p>
<p>高中低三級管理人員共四萬八千六百二十四人。</p>
<p>技術工人九十四萬二千人。</p>
<p>普通工人四百七十二萬人。</p>

<h3>社論　英國危難的深刻化</h3>
<p>英首相艾德里於一昨向全國人民廣播，囑全國人民一體努力，以克服當前英國的危機；並謂目前的情形，可與一九四〇年英國單獨對德作戰時相比，籲請全國人民節衣縮食，一心一德，波此難關。此次廣播傳到英國人民的耳中，使久困於戰時統制下的英國人民，愈益感到局勢的嚴重；在無可如何的情勢下，自然只有加倍緊縮，別無它法。然而在他們嚴肅而沈重的心情後面，總不免有些太息傷撼。在經過了長期對德日作戰而贏得了勝利以後，英國的人民原期勝利來到，他們或可稍有喘息的機會；但他們所而對的現實，不是戰時管制的鬆弛，卻是管制的加緊，一步一步的加緊，其加緊的程度，且猶甚於戰時，此在英國人民雖明知局勢如此，無可挽救，但終不免多少有一種幻滅的悲凉之感。</p>
<p>艾德里的廣播是向全國人民的呼籲。原來英國的經濟局勢，最近數月來，每况愈下，去年自美國獲得的十億美元貸款，消耗甚速，據財相達爾頓的估計，截至本年十月止，此款將全部用罄，到了那個時候，英國經濟局勢的危殆，眞將不堪設想。目下美國務卿馬歇爾雖曾表示美國願對英再予增援，且英美雙方齣首長不久又將舉行商討，但英國爲本身着想，終究不能長此依恃美國的援助：且美國的援助，是否能如預期，也着實不無問題。美國的國會已爲共和黨所控制，他們是不能全力支持政府援英的政策，觀於晚近國會與總統間的關係未臻圓滿，亦頗可慮；更何况英國爲了自尊的關係，如果要搖尾乞憐，究屬於心不甘。因此，艾德里政府爲希望渡過目前的難關，就擬好了一種緊急怯案，由國會授權政府，便宜行事。此一法案的提出，曾引起反對黨魁邱吉爾猛力的抨擊，認爲此案若獲通過，無異是英國民主政治的喪鐘，集權政治的誕生。就是有工黨方面，意見亦復未能一致。右冀份子頗有持反對意見者，而左翼份子又以爲政府態度的不夠積極，亦表不滿。此案於上周在下院一讀通過時，政府所得的票數並不多：因而若干人士頗爲艾德里政府祖憂：現在此案將付二讀，尤爲一般人士視綫之所集。</p>
<p>依我們的觀察，目下工黨在英國會旣佔着絕對的多數，縱有少數不滿份子，對於此一緊急怯案的通過，當不致有若何影饗；說不定明天傳來的消息，此案已獲通過。但此案的獲得通過，是否就此能使英國的局勢轉危爲安，要亦不無疑問。第一，爲謀英國的自力更生，此案如獲通過後，艾德里政府除一面加緊消費管制外，更將積極實施它所懷抱的社會主義政策，如鋼業的社會化就是。但問題是：英國生產效率的低落，似乎不全是一個國家政策的問題，而是設備的問題。英國爲工業革命先進國，因爲它得風氣之先，所以它的工業設備多已陳舊不堪，實已不合現代生產的條件。所以就是工黨政府實施社會化的政策，亦無法彌補這先天的缺陷。只要看自工黨政府執政以來，厲行煤礦國營，但英國在去年卻遭遇了嚴重的煤荒；而且更值得我們注意的是在美國的貸款中，其中有一筆很大的數字，是用在媒的輸入上的。英國以產媒著名，而今郤要向國外大量輸入，英國工業的衰頹，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>第二，目前英國的危機旣這樣深刻，而艾德里政府却勇往直前，竭全力以應付危難，此其精神，自至可佩。但我們於此要指出的是：工黨在一九四五年中普選的大勝利，是英國人民受了長期戰　痛苦的一種反應，他們對於工黨執政後局勢的憧憬是否一如今日，要亦不無疑問。戰時所不曾實施的麵包定量分配，工黨執政後實施了，而且此後的定量重要减少。假使英國人民料到勝利後有這樣的一天，縱然他們厭惡執政已久以保守黨為中心的國民政府，是否對於工黨有在競選時那樣的熱誠支持，實為一種有趣的究詰。目下工黨政府雖因爲有國會的絕對控制權或可將此緊急法案通過，但此是否足此反映目前英國人民一般的意向，亦頗値得研究。</p>
<p>第三，由於英國當前的危機，政府考慮召回國外駐軍。這使我們回想到當年麥唐納執政時的措施，將英國的軍備大事裁减，終於引起了希特勒的興起和其後第二次世界大戰的爆發，第一次工黨政府的組織在第一次世界大戰之後，當時的麥唐納是一個理想家，致造成了不可收拾的禍根。如今當第二次世界大戰之後，英國工黨又起而掌握英國政權；但英國却面臨着空前的危難。我們顧艾德里政府不但能安然渡過此難關，且將爲英國的歷史寫下了光榮珍貴的一頁！</p>

<p>救人同時也是救已</p>
<p>首由方主委報告，謂首都文化界發起之戡亂建國大會，曾發表宣言，闡明救國之道，及吾人應循之路綫，上海交化界陣容，最爲售大，目應響應　都文化界，舉行議亂大會，藉以表示「救人同時也是救自己」所應遵循之路綫。政府戡亂，由於共匪猖獗，破壞國家復員與建設，文化界站立於各界最前綫，應爲社會領導，如以上海文化界筆鋒，發動全國戡亂總動員，必可奏效。吾人深知檢桿能消滅暴動，而筆桿則可揭破麻醉烟幕，其潛在力極大。戡亂建國之主旨，在於喚起國人覺悟，如此，方能以文化之力量，一面戡亂，一面建國，協助政府完成建國大業。</p>

<p>此外更獲得一重要之新發展，即在天花板內，搜獲手槍一支，口徑爲·三二，但本身已被拆成零件。美憲兵隊現已送交警局槍照股，一俟裝配完整後，即將檢察最近有否開槍之痕跡。據一般觀察，此槍在未騐明前，雖未敢斷言即爲槍殺余盛孝之凶器，但以情度之，或已什九不離矣。</p>
<p>美憲兵總部昨並派員往晤却利阿却，吿以馬萊日內即將審訊，屆時須要由渠出庭作證。同時並予以警吿稱：「渠若不出庭則全部罪行勢將由渠一人承担」。當時却利聞言，默然無語，若思良久，頻頻以中拭汗，似有不勝爲難之狀。但經美憲兵再三警吿，終以利害關係，始點首表示允應</p>
<p>刦利阿却原定昨日解送地院法辦，現因美軍事法庭需要却利作證之故，已決定暫緩移解。按却利於一九三八年，任職於工部局巡捕房時期，因詐欺竊盜，行爲不端，而遭開除。美兵馬萊則亦曾在芝加哥時犯有盜案，故兩人行爲相稱，可謂一丘之貉。</p>

<h3>湖匪廖炳南　竄聚平台山　勾結共匪薛永輝部</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫十日訊〕太湖股匪廖炳南，去歲九月間，由駐錫太湖招撫專織楊彥斌，派員　國榮，赴太湖平台山招撫，至十一月初招撫成熟，在吳縣胥口點編，歸淸剿部隊指揮訓練，太親治安得暫吿安寗，不料點編之後，廖部野性難馴，漸漸星散，仍入太湖爲匪，與未點編之匪衆，嘯聚一處，四出爲患。最近太湖沿綫，匪警時聞，加以金家讓一股，亦在湖中搶刦，京滬鐵路司令部，根據吳江方面消息：證實金家讓確係爲寇，並盛傳廖炳南與其部屬張寬等，已與共匪薛永輝部勾結作惡。詳情容探續誌。</p>
<p>查平台山，在無錫，吳縣，常州州，湖州四縣交界太湖中心，占地約十畝，山上有禹王廟一所，座北朝南，中有偶像、並有兩　額：一爲「天下第一山」，一爲「天上人間」，廟中無看守人，廟內外憂草　生。據悉廖部並非住在山上，均住在有七道篷，或十二道篷之大帆船中，船艙甚深。該山離錫境南門外吳塘門八十一里。</p>
<p>附近有一段神話，流傳甚廣，相傳湖中初無此山，某時有一大官府，船過該處，忽然狂風暴雨，危險異常，某官將衣帽擲置湖中，風雨仍未能息，後即　身跳入湖中，風雨遂停，得保全船人口性命。後來湖中即生出此小山，但地勢不高，儼如平台，故稱平台山。戰前昇平時代，廟中每歲有　塲，網船戶大都登山進香，盛極一時，現則落入匪區，荒草沒脛，渺無人烟矣。</p>
<h3>新舊開原　棺材店無生意老闆改業　「扒路」刦棺「修橋舖路」</h3>

<p>出了舊開原南關，渡淸河，坐「黃魚」車，行十公里，至新開原（車站），此地街道作輻射狀，外貌整齊，可見戰爭的遺跡，無聊的士兵，變成米糧販子，與糾查隊員們鬥智。扒手活躍異常，與交通　察逐角，車站上的秩序十分紊亂。有一位十六七歲的姑娘，她有活潑的大眼睛，高聳有彈性的乳房，不斷的與路　丟眉眼，她是一個米糧走私者，這實在是可恥可哀的鏡頭。</p>

<p>靈隆天竺香火繚繞</p>
<p>秋天氣，在杭州的第一個　汛，就是農曆六月十八日的觀音大士誕生之夜。凡是在杭州的人，都要到三天竺和靈隱去，至少也要擁到湖濱來。那一夜，所有的車輛都載着客人到北山進香，車接着車，絡繹不絕，呌不着車的，步行前往的也很多很多。由湖濱雇車到靈隱，三輪車的價格要六萬元，黃包車也要二三萬元，靈隱天竺等地的索食店素食　臨時搭凑而成的，數二三十，水菓攤，天竺特有的小豆腐干攤，　設得鱗次櫛比。靈隱寺裏，一聲聲宏亮的鐘聲叩入了每例人的心扉，大殿上香火繚嬈，一片「南無救苦救難觀世音菩薩」之聲，像是哀求着戰亂的早日終止。</p>
<p>蒲櫈籤筒不敷應用</p>
<p>三天竺，中天竺，上天竺也是香火鼎盛，叩頭的蒲橋不敷應用，有的人就跪在地上叩起頭來。「拆，拆，拆，」求籤的籤筒不敷應用，竟一排排的人候補着求籤。去上天竺的路上，有關帝廟等，也免不了沾光不少。這樣的燒香通宵達旦，裏西湖，白堤這兩條過道上，終夜人和人，肩摩踵接。黃包車夫鑒於公共汽車一車車的載滿了人，嫉妬之餘，搗毀了兩輛公共汽車。</p>

<p>第二香汛東獄進香</p>
<p>初秋的第一個香汛過去了，第二個香汛又要來了，第二個香汛是老東　進香。老東嶽是陰朝地府的塑像，那時不但捲起了杭州的市民的狂熱，而且也風魔了附近各縣的鄕民，其次，還有「雷公」「當母」的生日，要到城隍山進香去。</p>
<p>點綴在名勝地區的紅楓，又將是他的盛景時代了。也有很多人特地到九溪十八　去看楓葉，西溪去看蘆花。去年杭州菊汛不大佳，各個花圃在補植培養，希望今年菊花盛放，隨蟹肥時節而俱來！賞菊。</p>
<p>院長太太抽血救人</p>

<h3>星島球員六人　首批飛抵英倫　本月廿三日起開始作戰</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕星島足球會征英隊員首批六人，今日搭英國國外航空公司飛船抵達波爾水上機塲，其餘十三人，可望於本週內陸續抵此，星島會在英預定勾留兩月，業已約定英國第一流業餘球隊作九塲比賽。</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦十一日電〕全部由中國健兒組織之星島足球隊，已動身前來英倫，準備自本月廿三日起，與英倫蚤地球隊，作四星期之友誼比賽，以資觀擊。淸一色華人球隊，在英出現，以此爲　矢。茲悉其中六名隊員，已於昨日乘英國海外航空公司飛機飛抵此間，其餘球員，亦將於數日內陸續乘船抵此。此間人士對於星島隊與倫敦數大業餘球隊交鋒時，勝負誰屬，頗多揣測·</p>
<p>遠征雜碎</p>
<p>〔本報香港航訊　星島足球隊自敗於馬華隊後，舉行嚴厲的檢討會，除了速塲大戰致令兵疲馬乏，演出失常的原因之外，馮隊長景祥及胡好共同指出，□少數後起球員，不服當塲指導，以致軍心分散，是失敗的主因。這塲可作爲自高自大的球員作警惕！</p>
<p>這次星島遠遊，好的地方在管理良好，全隊採集體生活，未得特許，不能自由行動，極度着重規律，這是一枝勁旅的基本條件。</p>
<p>「小三子」秋亭，隨軍出發，但脚傷未愈，每塲只作「看客」，戰馬來亞聯隊時，看得着急，與「拼命三郎」張金海同撫痛脚共傷憐。</p>
<p>遠征戰果至現在，大少十數戰，只一敗一和，以有限的充補人力，得此成績，總算差强人意，計射球最多的是黎兆榮，表演最好的，前鋒是馮景祥，朱永强，後衛則許竟成，馮坤勝，劉松生都好，客串的高山龍也不弱。</p>
<p>在從星到仰光的海程上，他們趁的是頭等位，這裏紳士氣派濃厚，晚餐穿制服，行路踱方步，說話要扳面孔，這羣「波牛」活受罪，別有一番滋味在心頭。</p>
<p>在仰光作賽完畢後，虎隊蒞暹羅舉行義賽，七月十七日先戰該地元老隊易三倉隊，該隊人材濟濟，可惜老了，不中用，被星島痛擊，一隻復一隻，上半塲三球，下半塲七隻，十對零，虎隊奪得出征以來第一次大捷。</p>
<h3>乒乓總冠軍未產生　滬星昨撃退精武　二比五精武竟遭大敗　積分相等將擇期重決</h3>

<p>開賽後，精武楊開運首逢滬星黃志淞，楊開運按高一着，屢施抽削，以三比〇佔得先着。第二組張孚瑋相逢程愛心，此役較首組爲緊張，程愛心長力不濟，遂以一比三敗於張孚瑋。第三組水涵高與李宗沛登塲，賽前雖預測李可穩勝，但水之反抗，定亦銳利，接觸後，李宗沛抽短削，水涵高竟一無反抗之餘地，結果李宗沛以直落三輕取水涵高。第四組歐陽維與傳其芳，此組爲昨賽最緊張之一幕，開賽後雙方果然利害，至各二平手後，傅其芳賈其餘勇，屢施猛抽，歐陽維失手屢屢，結果傳其芳以三比二險勝歐陽維。至此滬星扳成各二平手。第五組薛緒初對陳曾亮，　成一面倒，結果薛緒初以三比〇輕取陳曾亮。第六組王昌厚相逢徐孫嘉，王係新病初愈，衆料徐可勝王，奈王昌厚沉着應戰，徐孫嘉無法進攻，反以〇比三遭王昌厚毒手。最後一組，與大局無關，滬星已奠定勝局，但兪　仍以三比一戰勝高宏興，總結五比二，滬星擊退精武。昨賽雙方積分錄後：</p>

<h3>票據當日抵用問題　銀行公會電財政部　建議變通辦法　行莊對信用良好之客戶可以通融仍於當日照付</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行商業同業公會，頃爲票據當日抵用問題，特　陳不能抵用後之弊害五端，並建議雙遞辦法，電呈財政部採納施行，茲探誌該呈文大要如次。</p>
<p>（一）現在各客戶中，一方收入票據款項，一方須於當日開發支票而爲付款者，以工廠及居間商人爲最多。工廠當日售出成品，往往須當日購入原料。因物價變動之難以預測，一賣一買，常須同日爲之。居間商如棉紗布商人及證券經紀人等，當日收入客戶支付價款之票據，同日必須開票支付自己應付價款。凡此兩款收付，爲數甚鉅。然均係基於實際的商業交易市面信用總量，並不因此項抵用，而有所擴張。如一律禁止，在工商業必將感受絕大不使。（二）於是大勢所趨，必將使工商業正當交易，改用現鈔。合法票據，失其流通效用，市面現鈔需要量激增（以現在情形言，金融業全體日常收付中現鈔約佔十分之一，如一般交易改用現鈔，則上述比例之增鉅何止倍蓰）。（三）由上原因，則中央銀行爲供應工商業實需起見，將不得不大量增發現鈔。此事是否適當，有無窒礙，關係　鉅。反之，若央行增發現鈔，不敷市面需要，則市面將立刻發生現鈔加水之情事。地下錢莊將乘時紛起，經營現鈔之買賣各種商品賣買，將有現鈔價格與票據價格之不同。在敵僞時期，因當日票據抵用被禁止而引起之各種紛擾，足爲殷鑒。（四）商業交易旣多用現鈔，凡現鈔之收付輸送勞費旣多，危險尤甚其流弊影響社會秩序。（五）同時且使工商業收入現鈔，爲避免勞費計，或將有一部份不再經過金融業，社會資金益將與銀行錢莊相隔絕。</p>
<p>總之，當日票據之抵用一層，在銀錢業方面，苞非爲顧全正當工商客戶之需要，增進自已之服務效率，幽何樂自負風險。特以事關工商業收付之便利，合法　據之流通，與自身業務之保持，故龜勉謹慎，選擇辦理，期不負金融業對於社會之使命。按諸過去事實，銀行莊之倒閉或停業，由於上述抵用之原因者，實屬無有。足見祇須行莊爲嚴格的審擇盡適當的注意，則此項有限制的通融，殊不失爲良好之一種。爰特　陳管見，擬請鈞部俯察商情，補充規定：</p>
<p>「凡行莊客戶解存黨日票據，當日另行開票支用者，如行莊對於廣發戶信用認爲良好，對於原票金額認爲當日可獲付款時，仍得通融當日照付。但此項通融，應由行莊審慎選擇，辦從嚴格。」</p>
<p>如此則同業業務處理可望普通穩慎，工商收付不致發生困難，伏乞　准施行，不勝切　之至。</p>
<p>再關於客戶開發存款不足或超越約定透支額之票據一節，前曾由屬會等訂定取締辦法，最近復由同業同討準備嚴格實行，俟實行之後，存款不足之退票，可望减少，即抵用之風險，亦益可减輕，其事爲治本之計，合爲一併陳明。</p>
<h3>了結交易居多　華股展開跌見</h3>
<p>華股昨疲莫能興，買戶業已覺悟，心理咸有轉變，了結者過衆，過程遂每况愈下，無法振作。除維牌中有統益紗廠，以增炎關係，利買傳說而獨俏，曾漲達漲停限度，熱股則在大衆放手下，求供相差懸殊。人心虛怯之外，更因物資之跌風加劇，更感難以應付。近午都現低價，永公現遞相繼跌停，滿塲愁雲籠罩，趨勢十分不利。</p>
<p>晨初開出即交永紗，在故意之做低下開小至二〇〇元大關，而遞永紗則反微升至二一二元。開後遞永紗二二三號一一二號賣到二〇八元，一一七號一四號六五號二〇〇號來進，九一號並進現永紗，曾回升至二一一元及二一四元高價。二二三號一一二號九七號二〇七號九四號脫手，退至二〇五元。九七號二三二號一七四號乘低維持，二二四號力購現永紗，回升至二一一元。入後八號三六號有供，九七號二一九號尙納。統益由二四號二三號等狂抬，傳增資有一變三十及發息二十元之佳訊，不時蠢動，統益漲達限度，一九〇號並進現永紗，尙呈穩定。終以次熱各股若美亞等十分鬆濫，每况愈下，人心終見不支。二二四號二二三號九四號一二號一七一號二一九號一五三號一〇三號二三五號連袂了結，一三二號並售現永紗，永公由二二號分別將現遞掛低至跌停限度，於十時二十分，現遞永紗同時破入二〇〇元大關內。一六〇號一二九號一四二號並將遞永紗迫低至一九六元。</p>
<p>十時三刻，三二號落手補空，曾回升少許，二一八號二三一號一七九號仍拋，一四七號力售現永鈔，而跌至一九一元及一九三元。十一時一刻，二二三號三二號一五三號一六三號四〇號趁低進至一九八元，一六九號一八〇號八三號拋賣，二二三號一六二號並賣現永紗，近午乃低至一九〇元及一九一元低價。七三號一三一號補進之下，午收即交以一九五號遞交一九八元結束。新光有七六號二〇四號吸收，回升較多。</p>
<p>收後遞永紗喊價平疲，結果較上週六，即交股計永紗美亞華豐新光動興各跌半成强，中法跌一成，新華跌落成半，永公跌停後有回，軋跌成半弱，景福僅降半成弱，統益漲停後有回，軋升半成，商務中絲國貨景綸內衣麗安跌半成，水泥大通新亞微挫，五和榮豐跌一成。遞交股計永紗美亞景福新光各低半成强至一成弱不等，華豐跌一成，永公跌停後有回，勤興微挫。塲外各老股計大生仍穩，餘股平平而已。</p>
<h3>統債回小　外股平定</h3>
<p>公債昨終吿回小，有利即撈，三六〇室雖進，五五五室五〇三室五五〇室俱有脫手，上升之勢遭阻而轉疲。統丙昨晨開一三一〇〇元，自二一三〇〇元起步降至一一七〇〇元左右收市，較上週六計甲乙跌一千元，統丙跌一千九，統丁挫一千四，統戊降一千三，成交約六百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股昨疲後有回，人心見低轉變。怡紗晨開七六〇〇〇元，自七五〇〇〇元起，拉上至七九〇〇〇元收市，金號業廣帮證券帮雖出，洋行帮及散戶俱進，一般心理對外股另有看法也。結果較上週六計電話航業尙平，餘股尙均微降。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美金債券募銷委員會第四次會議，已定於本日下午四時，假中國實業銀行信託部舉行。屆時將討論如何加強債券之募銷工作云。</p>
<h3>呢羢業反對日本貨　中信局保證不傾銷</h3>
<p>關係對日開放貿易，政府當局平已有原則之決定，即進口以原料爲主，禁止製成品之輸入。茲悉：最近有首批日本呢絨，計共三十萬碼，已於日前運抵上海，刻中信局正與海關辦理提貨手續中。本市呢羢業同業公會全體會員聞訊後，大爲震動。聞該業爲反對日本製成品輸入起見，將定于日內召開全體會員大會，商討對付辦法云。</p>
<p>又訊，本市毛紡織業公會爲中信局向日本定購三十萬碼呢絨事，於昨日推派代表至中信局易貨處詢問並交涉。由該處對日貨負賣人副理楊津生接談，各代表特面交申述毛紡業困難情形之公函一件，並建議將該項日貨運至國外推銷。楊氏當即表示該局爲避免與國貨競爭，早有出口之意，故保證決不摧殘民族工業，希望各毛紡同業放心，不日當再公開答覆云。</p>
<h3>財次徐柏園來滬視察　巡迴稽核團工作</h3>
<p>經過情形據稱頗爲良好</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部次長徐柏園，昨日接見本報記者，據談：此次來滬主要任務，係視察四聯總處巡迴稽核團工作情形，及財部會同國行稽楓人員，經常檢查各金融機構經過。渠稱：巡迴稽核團主要任務，係稽核國家行局放款情形，及各廠商獲得貸款後之運用情形。稽核經過，一般情形，堪稱良好。又稽核團將來工作，亦將推及於國行貼放委員會之放款工作。至財部會同　行稽核人員經常檢查各金融機構經過情形，亦稱良佳。最近上海巴川　和兩分行之停業，因該兩行業務範圍有限，兼以最近滬市銀根頗鬆，故於整個金融界無關。茲財部已決定吊銷該兩行上海分行執照。</p>
<p>記者復提問題若干，承分爲解答，效誌大要如次：（一）幣制改革問題，自魏德邁特使來華後，各界討論紛紜。惟渠稱：幣制改革，目前實爲一附帶之問題。主要仍須從整個經濟方案，逐步求其實現。如財政收支之漸趨平衡化，生產之合理化等等先決條件，須先求解決，則幣制改革問題，即能迎刃而解。（二）定貨貸款，四聯總處正在擬議祥細辦法中。惟過去政府已曾睦續舉辦，如本年之春兩貸款，即屬其一。關於中國植物油廠之定貨貸款一案，本週四四聯總處會議時，將有廣決定。總之，政府對定貨貸款，擬審愼辦理，當擇與國計民生息息相關者始行舉辦。（三）對上海證券經紀人方面擬請將遞交證據金改收三成一說，渠表示並無所聞。並稱：財部對此亦未準備考慮云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕財政部徐次長來滬後，曾於昨日下午四時，親自主特四聯總處巡迴稱核團會議，對該團稽核工作。頗多指示。徐氏在滬公畢，當於昨晚乘晚車返京云</p>
<h3>茶葉云化欠旺</h3>
<p>來茶葉市况過程並不活潑，良以各種內銷茶，際此炎夏，本街及客帮之去化，雖尙絡繹，但自買戶連綿進取以來，刻下需額漸足，因此無意暢收。至於外銷茶，上月法商永興洋行與非洲摩洛哥談妥之九百噸珍眉，聞本市承接之出口商，大都配備齊全，而目前咸在鵠候船期，是以對於任何花色，亦均抱袖手旁觀之態度。交易一致銳减，惟脚地仍以持貨者心思不餒，依然靜中帶穩。</p>
<h3>捲烟繼續上漲</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况續吿飛漲，市上以大英老刀兩牌買戶胃口尤健，拉提甚勁。華商烟美麗金鼠等亦跟蹤向上，蓋傳加稅勢必實行，本街存底甚枯，雖有外埠回籠貨抵滬，數量不多，各方需要孔殷，調劑籌碼仍感不敷，市勢在買氣籠罩下，行情扶搖直上。</p>
<p>昨十支大英烟又創高峯，爲一千零四十萬元，下午收盤爲一千零三十萬元，比週六猛漲三十八萬。老刀烟亦升十三萬，爲七百九十萬元。五華哈德門軋升三五萬元。華商條烟價亦一致跟升五六百至一千五百元，憔美貨條烟及聽頭烟平定。</p>
<h3>中信配售人造絲</h3>
<p>配價較上週減低三十萬元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局昨日第卅四次配售人造絲，配價除東洋大富貴爲二千二百四十萬元外，其他天橋高山金三馬等，均爲二千二百卅萬元，較上週配價低卅萬元。</p>
<p>據該局發言人談：該局對减低配價一事，在行政院賦予權力範圍之內，無不酌予考慮。（按政院曾規定：該局處理柏賣或標售政府物資，其價格以低於市價百分之廿爲原則。）如外界請求抑低配價已超出該局處理權力之外，則須待請示行政院後，方能決定云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕人造絲配售價雖已减低三十萬元，但絲織業尙在繼續進行請願中，故昨市各方仍抱觀望態度，市况極形呆疲。一二〇號金三馬有光，上午二千四百五十萬元至六十萬元之間盤旋。下午稱軟，比上午價又短十萬元，交易異常稀少。</p>
<p>廠經疲軟</p>
<p>廠經供多求少，市勢疲軟，各級高勻度喊價興上週末雖無更動，但買方還價甚低，殊乏成交，昨市D字貨討二千八百五十萬元，還價八百萬元，E字貨討價新絲八百萬元，陳貨七百五十萬元，還價只六百萬元，均未成交，高另担七天期二千八百萬元有成交，干經高檔貨銷呆，普通另担，稍有交易，價在一千六百萬元左右，中信局昨售出徽安小廠絲，價一千九百〇八萬五千元，市上售價，約在二千〇五十萬元之左。</p>
<p>綢銷清淡</p>
<p>綢貨眞絲被而因實銷淸淡，且廠方將有開售，故昨市異常疲軟，開市時大誠貨一千〇四十元萬元有人要，華強貨三十萬元有人要，一度到達三十三十萬元，後即下降，最後即期價二十六七萬元，隔日期做二十九萬至三十萬元，大誠貨即期三十六七萬元，隔日期四十萬元，格子璧縐交易雖稀，脚地甚硬，四千七百元有成交。</p>
<h3>食米堅疲不一　豆油上落狹隘</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧八千三百餘石，市况堅疲不一，新粳貨湧銷細，中次步跌三五千至萬元不一。粳米早薄稻提高殺次甚烈，天氣炎熱，宿次粳米竟少受主，白陰元似乎帶挺，秞米因產價堅挺，貨主甚堅，續加萬元。新埠秈則溧陽續有到申，趨勢平平</p>
<p>麵粉略有參差，廠粉先緊後懈，結果無甚波動，洋粉去胃活潑，猛漲萬元一雜牌粉零化亦殷，挺升二三千元。麩皮廠方不肯　售，執貨者心思仍　，回升千元。豆餅台潤去化廖寥，鄕莊銷令已過，逐步低落，再　二三千元，營口餅狂　六七千元。雜糧各路新貨來源不弱。</p>
<p>黃豆贛鄂到潦踵接，浙東源源而來，市化見淡，新陳黃豆一律回挫四五千元。蠶豆到銷兩平，價無變化，惟揀靑則消化香燥，大多炒貨去路微升三五千元，莞豆台灣續進，市形堅　。</p>
<p>豆陳貨胃呆　　，　定暗疲，新貨受主稀寥，再跌三五千元。元麥供求兩少，無所榮辱。紅糧見低二三千元，苞米狂漲暴跌，崇明新貨已到，人心虛軟，劇跌二萬元。生仁提高殺次，芝蔴彷彿</p>
<p>油市廣帮不動，生油初漲後回，結局平正。豆油暫無上落，菜油亦少變動，淸油帶軟，蔴油亦無軒輊。</p>
<h3>食糖漸趨穩秀</h3>
<p>昨糖市以去化漸動趨勢轉穩，公會劃盤，二〇中砂白回升萬餘元，爲五十六萬三千元至五十六萬元。四半白草包現貨七十二萬五千元，袋莊棧單七十萬〇五千元，二四粗白七十一萬元，台赤五十八萬元。汕提靑四十四萬元，升萬元，次四十一萬五千元，計二百餘包。與化白袋莊高貨六十一萬五千元至六十一萬元，簍莊五十八九萬元。興赤好貨五十一萬元至五十一萬二千元，次四十一二萬元，計二百數十件。刁靑好貨三十五萬元至三十五萬五千元，油次者三十三四萬元，成交二百餘包。</p>
<p>國藥轉堅</p>
<p>國藥市價入夏以後，萎疲不振，今屆秩令，稍形轉機。各路批發商略有添配，以川貝母，象貝，杏仁，防風，黃蓮厚樸，云化最多，市價由疲轉堅。近日以滬杭路之松江，嘉善，嘉興，硤石等，蘇北以黃橋，泰興一帶，較爲頻繁。然各路批發商之購買力，薄弱非常，均以拆零有進，原件整箱，幾絕受主。</p>
<p>杉木續疲</p>
<p>福州產價亦趨下游，若無其他變動，恐在中秩節前無振作希望。洋貨中柳安，因尙未到埠，市價尙好，惟成交數有限。</p>
<h3>利賣空氣籠罩下　棉紗布直綫下瀉　大部紗價跌入紡建議價之內</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，以紡建公司照例開售二十支粗紗，議價减低至九百五十萬元，然市上大部紗價，均已跌入議價以內，而本客實銷絕少開展，且利賣空氣籠罩，以致市勢直綫下瀉，迨至最後，二十支雙馬紗比週六猛跌七十萬，爲九百三十萬元。四十二支藍鳳跌六十萬，爲一千五百五十萬元，特雙馬爲一千二百二十萬元，亦降三十萬，其他各支粗細紗一致下降二十萬至六七萬元不一，</p>
<p>昨日棉布市勢再吿在瀉，傳香港方面某種高檔士林布，每疋僅售四十萬元，地龍牌細布三十四萬元，元嗶嘰及直貢呢三十二萬元，商人在滬聞已有拋售之說，本市人心因之又大起恐慌，塲上利賣空氣濃厚。買戶觀望，本客實需甚稀。更有業外囤戶，紛紛出籠，行情一路下降。</p>
<p>最後十二磅籠頭細布比上週六猛挫二萬，爲三十八萬九千元，五福藍鷄彩球陽鶴等，各檔細布，價幽狂瀉一萬五六千至三萬三千元，其餘漂布細斜粗布嗶嘰府周藍布士林布等一致下降五六于元至二三萬元不等。並聞塲外籠頭細布竟喊三十八萬六千元，有人肯脫手云。</p>

<p>編輯先生：鄙人兄弟三人，業已分居，余最幼，尙隨母度日，抗戰　發後，余即投軍。未幾次兄亡故，膝下無子，有一女尙未成年。　嫂不遵婦道，不顧家庭，與族叔私通，幷盜賣家產。余等因久居在外，亦未過問，近日又將祖遺屋基三問變賣。經家母勸誡無效，反謂家母無權干涉。長此以往，家產將被賣盡，請問：（一）無子之孀婦是否有權變賣祖產？（二）無子孀婦如盡祖產，再轉適他人，可否迫回產權？（三）已被變賣之祖產，是否可以回贖？（四）孀婦如揑造賣產爲　還其夫生前負債，或因無力瞻養女兒爲藉口，應如何處理？（五）日後　祭祖宗。或為次兄繼子立嗣，若無產業，則如何處理？鄭良楷謹上。</p>

<h3>房租一增再增</h3>
<p>房客盼　當局速予規定</p>
<p>編輯先生：我們接到房主通知書，自六月一日起，每月房租要四十五萬元，按本房租原照一百八十倍計算，應付三萬元，去年十二月份起，該房東以物價高　爲田‘忽增至十五萬元，已超過政府　定之議價六百餘倍之多。無奈我們爲互相體諒照付，但若按目下再增之數目，那麼，又遠在前政府之規定二千五百倍以上了，似此駭人聽聞，我們於無可奈何之時，唯深深盼望當局速予設法評定房租指數，使房客循規以行，庶免彼此有所議，有所　　。上海市一房客謹啓</p>

<h3>聲明</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>是前天下午，北方日報的唐國華先生來訪，一見面，他便吿訴我近來剛看完我做的一部小說，我問他是什麼名字，他說：『溫柔」。</p>
<p>「什麼」？</p>
<p>我非常驚訝，懷疑自己的耳朶聽錯了，或者是他說錯了，又重復地問了一聲：</p>
<p>「書名是什麼』？</p>
<p>『「溫—柔」　』唐先生加大了聲音，怕我還不懂，他又加以解釋：「溫是溫度的溫，柔是柔軟的柔」。</p>
<p>『沒有！沒有！像我這種硬性的人，怎麼會寫出「溫柔」的文章？你一定記錯了，請你趕快把這本書找來給我看看』。</p>
<p>『我看完之後，被一位朋友借去了，但我可以寫信叫他寄來」。</p>
<p>接着，我們談到幾個有關寫作方面的問題，但我的心裏老想着那本「溫柔」，不知究竟是什麼人情願埋沒自己的「文名」來「捧」我的塲，也許客人看出了我的不安，他沒有久談便吿辭了。半小時以後，忽然唐先生又轉來了，他手裹拿着一本「溫柔」，並且吿訴我：『這是在西單商塲的書攤上買的，去年很多，現在沒有幾本了，也許是因爲您花北平，所以不敢公開賣吧」？</p>
<p>說完，他流着滿頭大汗，又騎着自行車匆匆地去了，我要付給他書錢，却遭到了拒絕。</p>
<p>一看書名和畫着那幾筆醜陋難看的女人的臉相，就知道內容一定是描寫色情的。翻開目次一看，果然第一篇便是「初得到異性的溫柔」，內容敍述一個中學生調戲女招待，以及爭風吃醋的事情；第二篇「月」，更進一步無聊，居然調戲起女學生來了。最令人痛心的，裏面有好幾處提到北平求學，是「留學異國」，這呌我對於本書作者的國籍，不免起了懷疑，加之滿篇都是「協和語」，一看就令你感到又可恨，又可惜！</p>
<p>正在這個時候，我接到一封寄自太原的信，一看筆跡，就知道是陶小姐寫的，信的最後一段寫着：</p>
<p>「前天我在王太太那裏，借到了一本「溫柔」，一看是您的作品，我一連看了兩遍，可惜沒有出版地點和年月」。</p>
<p>後面那句話，顯然她也在懷疑。「一連看了兩遍」，如果是眞的她未免太上當了!</p>
<p>一個文人，各人有各人的風格，如果看慣了她的作品，即使換了好幾個筆名，也會知道這是誰的作品。正像冰心女士用「男士」的筆名出版了一本「關於女人」，大家都知道是她寫的，因爲她的名字雖然改了，但是她的風格並沒有改變。我生性憨硬，像這種「溫柔」的文章，今生恐怕永遠學不會也寫不出了。現在，所謂「上海華中出版社」也者，居然呌我「掠」人之「美」，實在於心不忍，於理也不合，不得不聲明一下。</p>
<p>「溫柔」的內容，實在無法用文學眼光來批評，寫的故事，除了第一篇發生在杭州外，其餘都是在北平發生的，這書的封面上印的是「一九四六上海華中出版社印行」，並沒有發行人的名字，也沒有發行所的地址，更沒有序言，這很顯明，是無聊的漢奸文人玩的把戲；尤其令人可疑的，文章後面都寫的一九二九於上海，按一九二九是民國十八年，北平是廿六年才淪陷的，而書中所寫的又是淪陷以後的事，眞是牛頭不對馬嘴。一九四六是去年，十八年前的作品。留到去年才出版，應該是一部轟動世界文壇的巨著，何至於無聊到只寫些男人玩女人，女人玩男人的下流文字，而且照文字的內容推算起來，在十八年前就有了「僞滿洲國」這又未免太拿讀者開玩笑了！</p>
<p>够了！够了！例子不必再舉下去，像這樣無聊的文人，寫出這種卑鄙下流的文章來毒害靑年，實在是罪不容誅！而假冒別人的名字出版，更是窮極無聊，死有餘辜！</p>
<p>朋友舞知道了這件事，看到了報上的消息，都非常氣憤，他們自動地願意替我偵查「華中出版社」的地址，還主張依法懲辦那位冒牌的「謝冰瑩」。但我覺得這三個字，我旣沒有呈請專利，又何必如此認眞，不過爲了不敢「掠」人之「美」，所以不得不鄭重聲明一下。</p>

<h3>海的招喚</h3>
<p>— 湯匡瀛</p>
<p>天是藍的，星也是藍的，海也是藍的。時候和今晚一樣：仲夏之夜。你輕盈而纖巧的衣角沙沙地拖過海邊的細石，發起和像音樂一樣曼麗的奏唱，悄悄地像一個憂鬱的修道女，白色的衣服掠過海邊矮矮的竹籬，讓月亮光把那些巧麗的野合花倩影撲上你衣角，你毫不理會地走了；也不回頭來瞧瞧那些躺在泥土裏失去了愛戀野合花的影子。</p>
<p>「配上這一點簫聲更有意思了」！</p>
<p>你頹然地在路邊的石塊上坐下來，你的眼珠老是望着海，望着天，望着會眨眼的星星。你是愛藍色的，但那晚你心裏並不一定夢着藍色；或許正在玄想明天遙遠的旅程。這今晚的星星，海色天空，明天用寂寞的旅懷去追念時，都是黯愁一的資料，你所以感到憂鬱了。</p>
<p>其實，數千年人類歷史過來，何處無月，何處無星，何處不見天空，又何處不見海色；上帝並不需要人類的眼淚與嘆息來茁壯這人間，而人間却正在濫用眼淚鼻涕嘆息去埋葬了人間的光亮。譬如今晚吧？多多少少征人在海邊納着凉，大家心裏都有一個世界：小孩子們發狂地想跨到海底去撈月來玩要時，大人心裏却湧起那些狂風驟雨中海航傾覆慘酷的故事；年靑男女看做星星是最好一對對情侶的象徴，而年紀大的人却去憂鬱起牛郎織女悽然別去的情景了。就說這一支悽惋的簫聲罷，你又能一定斷定吹的人是把自己埋葬一在憂鬱的包圍中麼？</p>
<p>不過，誠像你那晚所說：「我們是人，人只有人的理智與力量呀」！</p>
<p>多多少少的人向海邊靑靑的錄樹遠去而不見舊日的歸舟，多多少少的人嘶啞了喉嚨向海招喚着失去的靑春，又不知多少的人珍情着身邊的歡笑與眼淚化成一片模糊。但，這海邊，最知道這些的是沙灘邊的細石和竹籬上的野合花，但它們曾吿訴過些人類是什麼？</p>
<p>你說：『千古來海是一個埋葬人類愁苦最大的魔窟。」</p>
<p>『倘使人類的眼淚像海水一般地多，世界的眼淚會比水都不値錢呢？」</p>
<p>爲了我這句回答，於是更引起你那句：『所以，人有時實在太顯出渺小，但有時也像很偉大」。</p>
<p>這幾年來，我已像一隻失去航桅的破舟，風狂雨暴中我總放　俏悄停泊於竹籬茅舍之間，讓那些矯健的水手用力使帆向我面前駛過，而使他們投我以一百個鄙視，我自己打定主意不報以一個還眼。我只像一隻家鴿，躱在屋檐下整飭着自己被雨淋濕的羽毛，不想投身於四海蒼茫之中去做起一個斷肢折　的低能英雄，非以海天不够偉大，遠征不是宏圖，但我覺得有時一個跟着時代後面拚命追趕得汗出如注的人，還不及袖手旁觀者來得幸運。</p>
<p>在你離開海邊的一個時候，我也悄悄地像一個行脚僧似的掛單在這個離海要三四百里的小城，每夜數起這深夜街頭寂寞者的履聲，我忽然像全身沾滿了泥士的氣息。我不禁驚奇：『什麼時候起我被小城作了俘虜」？聽起每夜更聲，我記起海浪的聲音，還有藍的星，藍的海色，你飽含憂鬱藍色的眼，於是我打開小窗望着遠處，我說：我要向海招喚，讓裝滿淚水的破航，從我熟悉的地方駛來。</p>
<h3>夏蟲篇</h3>
<p>— 翟放</p>
<p>蟬</p>
<p>中午，火烈的太陽，毫無虛偽地，遮蔽地照射着大地，照射着溪邊，更照射着黃桷樹上的蟬。</p>
<p>天邊帶着一串白雲，樹上帶着一串蟬鳴。</p>
<p>蟬扯直了翅膀在叫。</p>
<p>那聲昔就像破裂了的簫，像一塊燒紅的鐵片放進水裏一樣：</p>
<p>於是，我厭惡蟬。更厭惡蟬鳴。</p>
<p>春天，百鳥的呌鳴是一首美好的詩，秋天的雁子的嘹亮，使人的發雜的情感會潤濕。冬天，蒼鷹在寒空高翔，人們知道春天不會太遠……</p>
<p>唯有夏天，蟬鳴攝服了一切的聲音。嘈雜，煩惱……</p>
<p>當梧桐葉落，蟬毫無蹤影地溜了。</p>
<p>蝙蝠</p>
<p>天邊抹上一片紅，歸林的鳥在急馳……</p>
<p>屋簷下，竄出了一隻，兩隻，三隻……黑色的蝙蝠，在穿梭，在裁跟斗，在滑翔……</p>
<p>就這樣，富着詩意的暮靄的黃昏給它帶走了。</p>
<p>於是：我感到了惶惑。</p>
<p>黑夜的幃幕輕輕地撤下來了。</p>
<p>於是：我厭惡上了蝙蝠的狡猾。</p>
<p>蛙聲</p>
<p>蕭洛霍夫說：「寂寞是無聲的音樂，慢慢地給人們奏着哀歌……』</p>
<p>但是：蝙蝠在天上飛，田埂上牆圍脚下……的蛙聲在此起彼應，，啯啯……地。</p>
<p>我會燃上一隻烟，不感到寂寞地遐想。</p>
<p>我更會趁這不寂寞的蛙聲的夏夜，用着不寂寞的心情和豐富的情感寫下一篇詩頁，訂在心愛的詩集裏。留着沒有蛙聲的寂寞的夜朗誦……</p>
<p>有了娃聲，我是永不會感到寂寞的。</p>
<p>螢火蟲</p>
<p>藍色的天，綠色的平原。</p>
<p>夏夜，天上有星：地上有螢火。</p>
<p>似夢非夢的黃金的童年在顯現。像一首詩，也像一角浸蝕着淚的衣襟。</p>
<p>童年，夏夜，抱着母親的膝　，聆聽着關於螢火蟲和螢火的故事：</p>
<p>「七巧的那一天夜晚，天上的銀河寬大着發亮，地上的螢火編織成了一串眞珠的光茫，就是牧牛郎當着這光亮走向銀河去和織女見面……」</p>
<p>這是一個愛情的故事，也是我失掉母愛的最後的一個故事。</p>
<p>一堆黃土，一片靑草掩埋了母親，掩埋了這些故事……</p>
<p>童年像一首小詩，像一角浸蝕着淚水的衣襟。呵！</p>
<p>螢火來了我底哀思和懷念</p>
<h3>百合花</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>在每年的夏季大街小巷，小販挑着一担担百合叫　着。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　370</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這個說法，好像有些過甚其詞似的，但如找到當日任何一位東北同胞問問，也許說得比這「過甚其詞」還要過甚些；而當日實際的種種無人性，無理由的演出，比這「過甚」尤要過甚。</p>
<p>別的不說，只憑一條無理由的理由，這旅舍就不能免除嫌疑：「這兩個『抗日份子」爲什麼不到別的旅舍去，偏要到你這裏來？」同樣的理由，可以問到奄不相千的旅客身上：「這裏許多旅舍，你爲什麼偏要住到這個『抗日」的旅舍裏來？」</p>
<p>况且還有一點：當日無論出關入關，那張「通行證」，必是保上加保，經過許多麻煩手續，方肯簽發，而沿路九關十八卡，幾乎大小車站，對於這張「通行證」都有記錄。試問如此嚴密的管制，一聲出事，縱令事主脫身走了，那受牽連的豈在</p>
<p>固然耀羣小老虎這張證書，是由軍部出面簽發，然而如要追索起來。尤其易於水落石出。所以說，當時那個乾癟的老傢伙，雖說神情可厭，面目憎人，却是動他不得，只能按捺着性子，有問必答，而且還要答得不及不離，句句都有根底。</p>
<p>就在那老傢伙這一問之後，耀羣還未開口應答之前，小老虎口裏剛剛喃着：「這老東西算咱們中國種嗎？」就在這句話裏，兩人身後轉過了那一位招待，插到二人前面，迸出了一股丹田底氣，提得高高的嗓子：</p>
<p>「我說侗二爺，這二位是咱們老掌櫃的舍親，剛從火車下來，只在這裏歇歇脚，並不住下……况且……」</p>
<p>招待員說到這裏，條地轉身瞧着我們放低了嗓子：「這傢伙耳朶有病，……快！……有證明身份字兒嗎？……準有……快給我……」</p>
<p>以上這兩個突出的小動作，充分說明了這個塲面的內容，也把那位招待員的心事，充分表現了出來。耀羣何等機警，一聽這話，立刻拿出那份軍部簽發的「許可證」，遞了過去。</p>
<p>「嘿……」那招待員一見這個特殊文件，立刻眼睛一亮，射出一股奇光，那木木毫無表情的一張大圓臉，本來绷得緊緊地，這時突然放鬆下來，掛着奇怪的笑容：</p>
<p>「我說侗二爺……」他嗓子放得更高，猛然把那份特殊文件，送到那乾　的老傢伙面前；」　，人家來頭可眞不小哪……您認識日本文兒嗎？……不會……！我知道您不會哪……瞧這顆印兒……瞧這官封……「大日本…」「許可…」這是咱們……咱們的字……眞不含糊……這就對，是這照片吧，可是他們二位本身？……　然沒有錯見，不是嗎？……我說侗二爺：…』（三六八）</p>

<h3>大學考生何處去？</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>全國及本市各大學這兩天正在本市舉行招考。這次各大學報名的考生，特別踴躍，有一家國立大學，報名學生已達七千數百人，其餘各校擁塞的情形，更可想而知。</p>
<p>但是各校收取的額制是多少呢？僅上面所舉的那家大學，雖有七千人投考，但只收四百人，它的比例是一千人中，只收五十餘人，其餘的六千六百人，要他們向何處去呢？</p>
<p>我們沒有統計數字，可以稽查來上海投考各大學的學生總數有多少，但是，僅以一家大學的投考學生的數字來窺測全滬的考生，它的總數一定是可驚的。</p>
<p>那麽，這些未被錄取的大學考生，他們今後應該向何處去呢？</p>
<p>據說，這次考生的原籍，以山東，河南佔了一大部份，他們家鄕正在烽火之中，他們的家庭經濟，一定不容易担負他們的學費，他們來投考大學，當然是想考「公費生」，但各校額制有限，那一大批未能錄取的靑年畢生，他們決沒有再回家鄕的打算，他們大部份都想留在京滬一帶，希望能够找個機會做做事，或是半工半讀，或是想想別的辦法。</p>
<p>但是，不景氣襲擊下的上海，用什麼方法來「款待」這批遠道跋涉的靑年學生呢？</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「法新社」的停閉</h3>
<p>— 艾夫比</p>
<p>編者按：法國新聞社自八月份起，上海社對外停止發稿了。這和中國新聞界有過一段悠久關係的外國通訊社的終止發稿，我們不能不表示惜別之意。茲特請艾夫比先生爲我們敍述一點該社停止發稿的內因，也算作爲一種惜別「致詞」吧！</p>
<p>一九四七年七月卅一日的上午，法國新聞社上海分社社長甘士波先生，以非常沉痛的語調，宣佈自八月一日起，停止發佈中英文稿子之後，自八月二日起，上海所有的中英文報紙，不再刊載法國新聞社所報道的消息了。一般讀者，對於法國新聞社悄然撤離上海，無不表示扼腕。從此上海關於國際新聞的報道，將爲美國通訊社一手包辦了。所以法國新聞社的停止發稿，在關心國際新聞的讀者，實在是一大損失</p>
<p>法國新聞社停止發稿的原因，說來實在非常簡單。戰後的法國，在表面上雖已恢復了她戰前的國際地位；但是按之實際，戰時受了德國的摧殘，元氣喪失殆盡，一時不能恢復，尤其在經濟上，美國雖曾以鉅款貸與法國，從事復興工作，但是所有的貸款，用到現在，快要用盡了；賴瑪迪挨內閣，現正爲着「美元恐慌」而發愁。因此凡是要用美元的事業，不得不特別注意，法國政府爲了節省美元起見，乃停止對於法國新聞社的津貼，而要求其經濟獨立，能够自給自足，不再仰賴政府用美元來津貼。法國新聞社巴黎總社，在這種情形之下，便不能不改組。新任社長視事之後，檢查各分社的收支情形，發現到中國分社的收支不能平衡，而且入不敷出，相差甚鉅，乃派遣了一位譚士谷先生前來遠東考察實際情形。從那時起，法國新聞社受了美元恐慌的影響，早就在風雨飄搖之中了。</p>
<p>譚士谷到了上海，又到東京去）次，發現一個奇蹟，就是東京分社，尙能自給自足；但是上海分社却不能不靠總社津貼；因此他決定自七月份起，增加各報的稿費。但是上海的報界，也正鬧着經濟困難，大家都抱着「節一個錢好一個錢」的態度。譚士谷與甘士波商量，又與中文部主任儲玉坤磋商。三人乃於一個非常燠熱的下午，同到大公報去拜訪李子寬先生，除了向中國報界辭行而外，並說明了來意；從李先生的談話裏立即發生一國不良的印像，使他相信法國新聞社要在上海能够自給自足，是一件不可能的事情，沉默寡言的甘士波很感慨地說：「法新社的情形，像今天天氣一樣的沉悶！」但是譚士谷却仍不失望，鼓了絕大的勇氣，再到申報去拜訪陳訓　先生，陳先生的態度，完全不同，不僅表示同情，而且答應增加稿費的要求，譚氏離開申報館時，滿面春風，在他的心裏，又引起了一綫希望。</p>
<p>譚甘儲三人回到分社之後，便共同起草要求增加稿費的信，要求各報同等待遇，結果是給上海報業公會否決了。</p>
<p>譚士谷回到了巴黎，總社看到上海不能自給自足；乃決定訓令上海分社停止發稿。甘士波在南京接到這個電話之後，立即趕來上海，召集全體員工卅餘人，除了宣佈解散加倍發給遺散費而外，並向全體員工表示謝意。法國新聞社上海分社的壽命，到比也就終了。</p>
<h3>名著介紹：「我選擇了自由」</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>聯合國在大戰期間，爲了消滅納粹勢力的威脅；雖會超脫了「思想的衝突」，結成同盟，駢肩作戰，爭取勝利，並相約在戰後共同締造世界和平；但是到了戰後，「思想的衝突」，死灰復燃，又成爲國際間隔閡的源淵了。不僅我們對於蘇聯國內的實際情形，無法洞悉其全貌；就是在蘇聯勢力控制的地區內，因爲有「鐵幕」的存在，也無從探悉其實際情形。這種國際上的隔閡，最容易引起國際間的誤會，猜疑，與衝突。美國有識人士在大戰期間，曾發起一種「國際新聞自由遝動」，欲藉此以維特仳界和平；但是蘇聯迄今尙未參加這個運動；換句話說，任何一國的記者，可以到任何一國去採訪新聞，不受任何限制；把採訪得來的消息，報導回去，也不受任何方式的檢查；報館接獲記者的報導之後，立即就可以刊載，也不受任何勢力的影響。但是今日各國的記者，却無法到蘇聯去首由採訪新聞，更不能自由報導新聞。</p>
<p>出版界所有關於蘇聯的著作，爲數雖多，但不是替蘇聯宣傳的，就是攻擊蘇聯的。對於蘇聯國內的實際情形，很少有翔實的報導。去年蘇聯作家克拉夫靑科，在美國出版了一本「我選擇了自由」，立即風行全國，成爲去年美國出版界銷路最大的一本鉅著。今春遝到中國，也受我國各界的重視，各方面紛紛找人　神出版，截止今日爲止，業已出版的，已有三種：（一）獨立出版社約譯本；（二）天地出版社的　本；（三）民治出版社約譯本。這三種不同的譯本，我都已看過。但終覺得民治出版社勤宣譯的，不僅譯筆流暢忠實。而且堪稱「信」。「　」。「雅」三者齊備。以我個人而論，對於翻譯，雖有十餘年的經騐，但終覺得中英文的結構不同，翻譯要能「信」·「達」·「雅」三者齊全，確是一件不容易的事情。我知道動宣先生翻譯之後，又曾經蔡正華先生的認眞校閱，所以我敢鄭重向讀者介紹民治的譯本。</p>
<p>至於我們爲什麼要介紹克拉夫靑科的著作呢？因爲作者克拉夫靑科是蘇聯的標準工人，曾受蘇聯共產黨的栽培，成爲蘇聯冶金工廠最著名的工程師；不僅有科學的頭腦，而且有其獨特的良知與智慧，所以當他一到了美國，好比置身於另一個世界，這兩個世界的一切的一切，都是截然不同的；使他感覺到：蘇聯雖然是社會主義的國家，但在僩人絕無自由可言；美國雖然是資本主義的國家，但是人人自由平等；經過他一再考慮的結果，他終於選擇了自由，除宣佈脫離蘇聯而外，並向美國要求取得美國國籍。最近據合衆社的報導，他不久就可以取得美國的國籍了。</p>
<p>他對於祖國，並無憎恨之意，只是覺得在共產黨統治之下，個人絕無自由可言；不能不脫離祖國；書中所報導蘇聯的實際情形，都是千眞萬確的事實，一言以蔽之，蘇聯是沒有自由的國家，「不自由母寗死」，這是每一個人良心上的要求；作者的寗願脫離祖國而選擇自由，是値得人人欽佩的。</p>

<h3>朱惺公之死</h3>
<p>— 西貽</p>
<p>——殉難報人介紹之二</p>
<p>上海新聞鬥士的殉難者之衆多，不惟超過全國各地的總和，亦且比所有文化工作人的死於抗戰者更多；這一點，已足充分證明上海新聞界如何出生入死以血肉之軀對敵僞作慘烈的搏鬥。就中對敵僞搏鬥最勇，死事最烈，而且正氣磅礴，罔計死生者，則不能不首推大美晚報附刊夜光編輯朱惺公先生，這以外，惺公先生又是上海新聞界第一個遭受敵僞有計劃的狙擊的人。</p>
<p>朱君名松廬，筆名惺公，江蘇丹陽呂城人。民國二十七年二月一日始入大美晚報館服務，主編附刊夜光。那時候正是上海國軍撤退不久，人心惶惶的時候，惺公先生每日揮其如橡之筆，發揚正義：擁護抗戰，尤其是對於一般奸僞冷諷熱嘲，不共戴天，以此博得了廣大上海市民的普遍同情，同時也喚起了隱藏在大衆內心的强烈敵愾。惺公舊文字的修養很深，筆鋒常挾情感，其每天一段的短評或雜感幾乎成了若干讀者飯後燈下經常必需的讀物。此外又不時出其餘緒，從事吟詠或其他種種文字遊戲，寄託遙深，技巧工緻，而且以擁護抗戰指斥奸僞爲指歸。汪逆兆銘發表　電，旋又遁出抗戰陣營，在敵人卵翼下危害祖國，上海各報均一致聲討，而允以朱先生所作諸文更痛切動人，以是乃益觸奸逆之忌。二十八年夏，僞特工總部　次投函恫嚇，朱氏屹不爲動，責斥奸僞益力。到六月中旬，朱氏大病甫愈，就接到僞中國國民黨剷共救國特工總指揮部投函恫嚇，謂夜光版如再發現反汪文字，「即將派員對其執行死刑」，朱氏得信，即草爲『將被「國法」宣判「死刑」者之自供』一文，發表於六月二十日的夜光版，洋洋灑灑數千言，以至大至剛的正氣，表明自已的堅定立塲，決不屈服亦不乞憐，抱定求仁得仁的決心，情願以身殉國家民族，而對汪逆則斥之益厲，謂其已由秦檜進而爲劉豫，中國如尙有一人存在，必將矢死以反對之。這一篇文字發表後，朱氏心地的光明純潔益爲國人所共見，而奸逆殺害朱氏的用心復亦因而決定。</p>
<p>當時朱氏住在公共租界北河南路九十四號，那地方與敵軍估領下的虹口閘北緊相毘連，原非安全地區，朱氏所以住在那裏，除了取其距離報館較近而外，主要還是爲了經濟的理由，他在大美晚報月薪不過百元—據說在他殉難以前不久的一塲傷寒病已使他負債纍纍—因此就不得不住在那並不安全但房租却比較便宜的地區，二十八年八月三十日那天下午四時朱氏循例由家中外出，步行到館工作，甫經走到北河南路天潼路河濱大厦附近，突有兇徒三人，由路旁疾趨而前，在朱氏身前及左右攔住去路，其中一人袖出手槍向朱君頭部轟擊，當時立即中槍倒地身死，及至崗警馳至，由捕房喚到救護車送往仁濟醫院，則已無法施治，至於行兇的暴徒，在朱氏倒地時早已分途遁去，在朱氏殉難前一天下午，尙曾接到僞中國國民黨靑年文化行動委員會的警告信，加以恫嚇，指其不利於「和平運動」云云。其爲漢奸方面僞特工所爲，自頂了無疑義。</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Wedemeyer Arrives in Taipei; Invited to Roundtable Conference with Taiwan Authorities Today; Mission in Taiwan Said to Involve Planning Troop Training</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 11th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer's C54-type Samsung special plane arrived in Taipei at 12:13 this afternoon from Beijing. Special Envoy Wedemeyer, wearing a grey suit, disembarked to the sound of music. Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming stepped forward to shake hands with the special envoy to express his welcome. US Consul to Taiwan, Blake, was also at the airport to greet him. After inspecting the honor guard, the special envoy was accompanied by Chairman Wei in a car to the Yuanshan Guest House to rest. Wei Daoming had a deep friendship with Wedemeyer when he was the former ambassador to the United States. Today, the two men arrived at the Yuanshan Guest House together and had a long discussion on the second floor, with no one else present. According to the special envoy's press advisor, Watson, at the airport, the group plans to stay in Taiwan for two days, and it is not yet decided whether to visit southern Taiwan. The accompanying experts will be divided into groups to collect information on Taiwan's finances, industry, and engineering.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 11th] According to authoritative American sources on the 11th, one of the main purposes of General Wedemeyer's current visit to Taiwan is to find a location to train new Chinese troops. This troop training plan is expected to be led by American officers. The source also pointed out that the current 150 to 200 American military officers in China are the core of training Chinese soldiers, and will be expanded immediately after approval by President Truman and Congress. Furthermore, Taiwan is an ideal training ground for soldiers due to its convenient transportation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 11th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his team held an informal meeting at the US Consulate in Taiwan at 1:15 PM to hear a report from US Consul Blake and to receive various information provided by Blake. At 3:00 PM, they met with Barton, the manager of Jardine Matheson, a British company, Simbolei, an agricultural expert from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Dickson, a Canadian pastor, and Smiggin, the manager of the American Fraser Company, and received some information from the aforementioned four individuals. At 3:30 PM, Special Envoy Wedemeyer, accompanied by US Consul Blake, drove to Taipei Guest House to return a visit to Taiwan Chairman Wei Daoming and Secretary-General Xu Daolin. Reporters saw the four men sitting around a square table, talking for fifty minutes. The special envoy listened to Chairman Wei's speech and took very detailed notes. During this conversation, reporters only heard Chairman Wei speak, while the special envoy only occasionally asked a few questions. Blake also only occasionally added supplementary comments, while Xu Daolin spoke the least. After the special envoy left at 4:30 PM, Xu Daolin revealed to reporters that the content of the conversation focused on the general political situation in Taiwan Province and did not involve other areas. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, the special envoy held a cocktail party at the US Consulate to entertain leaders of political parties, military and government agencies, representatives from the business community, and American expatriates. According to press advisor Bisson, in response to reporters' inquiries at the cocktail party, the team's mission in China is only to collect any information that can help clarify the "facts." The final decision will be made after returning to the United States. A reporter asked, "What is your country's special mission in Taiwan?" Watson replied, "Taiwan is a province of China, and its financial and economic aspects are affected by the Chinese mainland, just as the situation in the Far East is affected by the world situation. This visit to Taiwan is only to investigate a part of the overall situation in China and does not have any other special mission." The reporter also asked, "What is Special Envoy Wedemeyer's impression of Taiwan?" Watson replied, "It's too early to talk about impressions. We need to know the work." At 8:00 PM tonight, Chairman Wei hosted a banquet at the Taipei Guest House to entertain the envoy and his team, and invited US Consul Blake, Deputy Consul Faford, News Officer Jia Shu, and about 50 people from all walks of life to accompany them. According to a statement issued by the US Consulate, "Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his team are scheduled to hold a roundtable conference with Chairman Wei and the heads of various departments of the Taiwan Provincial Government at the Taipei Guest House at 9:00 AM on the 12th. The schedule for the afternoon of the 12th is yet to be determined." The statement also said that the special envoy will fly to Shanghai on the 12th and then to Guangzhou this weekend.</p>
<p>[Additional dispatch] It is reported that Special Envoy Wedemeyer may visit Keelung tomorrow afternoon and will stop in Kaohsiung for three hours on the 13th on his way to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Memorandum of the Political Council; Foreign Affairs Group of the Standing Committee to Hold Secret Discussion Today; Ministry of Communications Has Not Requested Any Loans from Special Envoy Wedemeyer</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Standing Committee of the Political Council will hold a secret meeting of the Foreign Affairs Group at 9:00 AM on the 12th to discuss the minutes of the symposium of council members on August 5th and the memorandum submitted to Special Envoy Wedemeyer, the contents of which are: (1) A critique of the US Far East policy. (2) The Political Council's representation of the people's position and hopes for American assistance.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] In response to widespread rumors that Wedemeyer's visit will involve a large loan to China to help build transportation infrastructure and the Tanggu New Port, the reporter inquired about this with Ling Shifen, an advisor to the Ministry of Communications, on the 11th. Ling said that Wedemeyer's main task on this trip is to investigate the facts. Although the Ministry of Communications has submitted a detailed list to him, it mainly describes the general situation of transportation and future construction plans, without any requests for loans. As for the US helping China build the Tanggu New Port, Wedemeyer was indeed very interested in the port during his visit to the north and expressed surprise during conversations with our personnel that such a large project was being undertaken with so little funding. The reporter asked if it was true that the US suggested building Zhejiang and Fujian into model provinces and strengthening railway and highway construction in those provinces. Ling said that this was not true. However, transportation projects in the aforementioned provinces are being actively developed, and a glance at the map will show the convenience of connecting transportation in Zhejiang and Fujian for the outward transport of goods from the interior. However, this type of construction does not necessarily rely entirely on external forces.</p>
<h3>The Resource Commission Takes Over; Situation of Industry and Mining in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Resource Commission has been successively taking over various important industrial and mining enterprises in Taiwan since May of last year. It will have been exactly one year by the end of June this year. The commission recently submitted a detailed report to the Executive Yuan on the progress of the past year. The key points of the report are as follows: The scale of the commission's operations in Taiwan is second only to the Northeast, divided into ten units. Among them, seven units are jointly operated with the Taiwan Provincial Government, including the Taiwan Power Company, Sugar Corporation, Salt Corporation, Paper Corporation, Cement Corporation, Fertilizer Corporation, Machinery Corporation, and Shipbuilding Company. Three units are operated independently, including petroleum, lead, and copper mining institutions. It is claimed that some of these units were severely damaged by strategic bombing by Allied aircraft during the war. After the takeover, they were fortunate enough to be able to repair the damage and gradually resume operations under difficult circumstances.</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense to Establish a Group; Studying the Personnel System</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Military News Agency reports: It is learned that in order to rapidly improve the personnel system, the Ministry of National Defense will establish a personnel system research group. The group will be composed of the director of the First Department of the Ministry, the chief adjutant (military position), the director of the Personnel Department (civilian position), and personnel officers from the general headquarters of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Combined Logistics. The scope of the research will include not only the personnel system but also the salary and compensation system and the pension system.</p>
<h3>Unified Training of Army, Navy, and Air Force Officers; New Army Headquarters Studying Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] According to the Military News Agency: The previously reported issue of difficulties in the unified training of Army, Navy, and Air Force officers, which is still under study, has attracted close attention from all parties. It is learned that the New Army Headquarters has specially organized a small committee to study the difficulties, advantages, and disadvantages in order to provide useful reference materials before a comprehensive and concrete decision is made on this new system. It is also learned that the committee has selected several experts to conduct detailed research from theoretical and factual perspectives and will publish a special article in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Gui Yongqing Reports on the General Situation of the Navy</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Kuomintang Central Committee's weekly memorial service for the late leader Sun Yat-sen was held at 9:00 AM on the 11th in the main auditorium of the committee. After Chairman Ju Zheng led the ceremony, Gui Yongqing, acting commander-in-chief of the Navy, reported on the general situation of the Chinese Navy.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Journalists' Delegation Visits Haikou; Most Residents Can Understand Mandarin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Haikou, 9th] The Beijing-Shanghai Journalists' Delegation arrived in Haikou City, the northernmost part of Hainan Island, at 11:50 AM on the 9th after a smooth two-hour flight. Shortly after taking off from Guangzhou, overlooking the Pearl River Delta, the land was submerged in water, the disaster having not yet subsided. Fertile fields were completely immersed, with only the crisscrossing paths vaguely visible. For 20 minutes, the view was obscured by heavy clouds. It only cleared up near Haian. The aircraft flew southwest along the coast at an altitude of 8,000 feet for about half an hour, crossing the sea to the south. All that was seen was blue water, blue sky, and white clouds. After a long time, land was sighted, which was Haikou City. We landed safely. Dozens of local colleagues gathered at the airport to welcome us and said, "Your visit is the first collective visit to Qiongzhou Island by the domestic press." The climate in the South China Sea is not as hot as imagined. Today, the indoor temperature here is still below 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The sea breeze is gentle, which is cooler than the capital when the reporters departed. After sunset, the heat gradually subsided, and the night was as cool as late autumn. Haikou, like other cities, does not have special tropical architecture. It is said that many of the famous coconut trees were cut down by the Japanese. The reporters only saw them once in the "Coconut Garden" where the commissioner's office is located. The Haikou dialect is similar to Chaoshan, but most residents can understand Mandarin and communicate with us in standard Mandarin without difficulty.</p>
<h3>Voter Registration Lists to Be Published Separately Before the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Voter registration lists for all constituencies nationwide will be completed by August 27th and published separately in each constituency by the 31st. It is learned that these lists will be used as the basis for issuing voting certificates for the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators. However, in the two months before the formal election of legislators, that is, the two months after the election of National Assembly representatives, if there are any increases or decreases in voters in each district due to changes in circumstances, they can apply to the competent election office for corrections so that the election can proceed accurately. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the General Election Office told reporters today that the election office is fully prepared for the steps to be taken to conduct elections in bandit-suppression areas and has ordered the competent election authorities in each area to compile a complete list of all voters as much as possible. If bandit-controlled areas are successively recovered, voter registration lists should continue to be created and reported so that voters in each area can exercise their due rights. As for areas with special circumstances, the election office has carefully considered measures to ensure that this election can be completed as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Nanjing to Recruit 1,000 Conscripts; Volunteers Begin to Register</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Nanjing's conscription quota for this year has been approved by the central government as 1,000, and volunteers can be recruited first to offset the quota. Volunteer registration began today and will end at the end of the month. Volunteers will receive a lump sum of 50,000 yuan and a family support allowance of 2.5 million yuan before entering the camp.</p>
<h3>Where is the CCP Headquarters?</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 11th] Fu Zuoyi stated that the CCP headquarters is now located in Suide on the border of Shanxi. Ma Hongda, chairman of Ningxia Province, stated during his recent visit to Beiping that, to his knowledge, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and other CCP leaders have established a headquarters somewhere east of the Yellow River north of Taiyuan, serving as the nerve center for the Communist army's operations in North China and the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Sichuan's Copper-Iron Sulfide Production Is the Highest in the Southwest; Provincial Government Plans to Build Ammonium Sulfide Plant</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chengdu, 11th] Hou Yuchi, director of the Sichuan factory of the Yongli Chemical Company, recently investigated mineral resources in western Sichuan with the technical staff of the Construction Department and learned in Peng County that the production of copper sulfide and iron sulfide in the area is abundant and the highest in the Southwest. On the 10th, he returned to Chengdu to consult with the provincial government to plan the construction of the largest ammonium sulfide factory in the country and to build the Chengpeng Railway to connect the Chengyu and Tiancheng railways for sales throughout the country. The budget for this project is US$5 million. According to Hou, if the provincial government is unable to operate the project, the Yongli Company can invest independently.

<h3>Interpretation of Two Points by the General Election Office on the Resignation of Incumbent Officials to Run for Election</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The General Election Office previously prepared explanatory opinions on the location of the offices and jurisdictions of incumbent officials, as well as the starting date of officials' resignations, and filed them with the National Government. The full text of the explanation is recorded below: (1) Explanation of the location of the offices and jurisdictions of incumbent officials:</p>
<p>According to Article 8 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law, incumbent officials may not be elected as National Assembly representatives in the electoral district where their office is located. In addition to the scope of officials that has been explained by this office to the Judicial Yuan, the so-called electoral district where the office is located is intended to be interpreted as "the electoral district where the government office is located." For example, Zhenjiang County is one of the electoral districts for National Assembly representatives in Jiangsu Province and is also the location of the provincial and county governments. Therefore, all officials who are subject to restrictions according to the explanation shall not be elected as National Assembly representatives in the Zhenjiang electoral district. Although the locations of all government offices may be within Zhenjiang County, Zhenjiang County is also included in the entire Zhenjiang electoral district.</p>
<p>According to Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Legislator Election and Recall Law, incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in the electoral district under their jurisdiction or where their office is located shall resign five months before the election period. In addition to the issue of officials that has been explained by the Judicial Yuan and the issue of the location of the office that has been explained above, the so-called electoral district under jurisdiction is intended to be interpreted as all areas of the jurisdiction, whether partially or wholly, included in the scope of an electoral district. They must resign in accordance with the law before participating in the competition in the electoral district. The scope of the location of the office is relatively narrow and is mostly included in the jurisdiction and electoral district. The division of this legislator election involves merging several administrative supervisory districts into one electoral district and dividing one administrative supervisory district into several electoral districts. The relationship is complex, and it is more reasonable to take the electoral district as the main body. For example, the Second Administrative Supervisory District of Anhui governs six counties, including Lu'an and Hefei. Now, Hefei is assigned to the First Electoral District, and Lu'an and other five counties are assigned to the Third Electoral District. Therefore, officials within this commissioner's office, who are subject to restrictions according to the explanation, must resign if they want to engage in competition in the First and Third Electoral Districts of Anhui. The original intention of this article is to prevent them from using their powers to manipulate the election. Although only Hefei County within the First Electoral District is within their jurisdiction, the legislator election is based on districts, so it is not appropriate to designate a certain county as not allowing them to engage in activities. In fact, it cannot be assumed that all the votes they obtain in a certain county are obtained by manipulating their powers and are therefore invalid. According to this explanation, for provinces and cities that are not divided into districts, all officials who are subject to restrictions must resign in advance if they want to compete in the province.</p>
<p>(2) Explanation of the starting date of officials' resignations:</p>
<p>According to Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Legislator Election and Recall Law, incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in the electoral district under their jurisdiction or where their office is located shall resign five months before the election period. The principle for calculating the starting date of this resignation should be based on the date of approval. However, the prescribed period for this legislator election is only six months, and the election date must be at least one month before the completion of election affairs. That is, resignation must be done when election affairs begin. The period of five months is not easy to be fulfilled. If it must be calculated after approval, the response to the resignation application and the exchange of official documents will take months and weeks, which is not unexpected. These resigned personnel have no opportunity to participate in the competition, which does not seem to be the original intention of the legislation. In order to take into account the facts, for this election, the explanation is intended to be the date the resignation application is submitted. The date of submitting the resignation application must be communicated to the competent election office by the head official in the name of the agency. If the resignation is retained, it should be calculated from the date of resubmitting the resignation application. If the date of resubmitting the resignation application is less than five months from the election date, the resignation shall be invalid.</p>

Ma Zhanshan stated that although he is old, he is willing to dedicate himself to the country and the nation until his death. He believes that there is a way to handle the affairs of the Northeast. The only problem is how to do it. Ma's 8,000 soldiers retreated into Xinjiang, and now 1,600 have returned. The Xing Yuan is trying to find a way to resettle them. The young and strong are enlisting in the army, preparing to fight back to their hometown in Songbei. The old will be allowed to live out their remaining years. Ma's troops established national defense in Xinjiang but were killed too much by Sheng Shicai.

Due to the wide range of import and export joint ventures, it was decided to consult with the Ministry of Finance before drafting. Restricting the import of unnecessary materials to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures is also being handled and does not require separate reporting.

<h3>Huang Shaohong Discusses Reforming Provincial Administration</h3>
<p>Believes Four Conditions Must Be Met</p>
<p>[This City News] Supervisory Yuan Vice President Huang Shaohong spoke freely to reporters yesterday about reforming local politics.

The above points were all mentioned at the recent symposium on reforming provincial administration held in Beijing. The government has paid close attention to them and is currently drafting a reform plan based on the above principles for implementation. Mr. Huang believes that in order to strengthen supervisory work and purify officialdom, the responsibilities of supervisory agencies should focus on reporting. In the past, the Supervisory Yuan has indeed seriously handled several cases, and the media has given strong support. However, it seems that the expected results have not been achieved, which makes people deeply feel that the supervisory and judicial aspects should be coordinated and given equal importance.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th] The Huiyang Ma'an Embankment, which was completed in May, encountered an unprecedented flood, and several sections of the embankment were destroyed. Various parties have criticized the project. Relevant authorities have organized a Ma'an Embankment Project Investigation Team, which departed on the morning of the 11th. After arriving in Huiyang, they decided to work with the Huiyang County Council of Representatives and the Chamber of Commerce to launch an investigation.</p>
<h3>Our National Railway Construction Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Air Dispatch, 11th] Our country's first five-year railway construction plan after the war has been formulated. The selection of all routes focuses on connecting the main political centers of the headquarters and the border provinces, consolidating military strongholds, promoting democratic economy, and emphasizing heavy industrial areas. As for the national defense routes, both coastal defense railways and land defense railways are given equal importance. However, under the principle of not violating national security, railway routes are designed to connect with important seaports.</p>
<p>Regarding the railway route construction procedure, before our country's industrialization reaches the planned goals, we should first focus on completing the main lines in the provinces of the headquarters, followed by the secondary lines in the northwest plateau, and finally encrypt the connecting lines of each line.</p>
<p>Our country currently has a total of 27,084 kilometers of railways, of which the Northeast accounts for 11,330 kilometers, the Interior accounts for 14,554 kilometers, and Taiwan accounts for 1,200 kilometers. Therefore, in the first five-year construction plan, it is not planned to build railways in the Northeast and Taiwan. It is planned to build 14,331 kilometers of new railways in the inland provinces.</p>
<p>The planned construction lines can be divided into three major systems: Northwest, Southwest, and Southeast:</p>
<p>Northwest System</p>
<p>The Northwest System is the transportation system of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. In the future, it can be extended from Hami to Dihua, and from Zhongwei to Lhasa. The traffic in this area is connected to the relatively industrialized North China in Baotou and Tongguan, with Tianjin, Qingdao, Haizhou, and Hankou as its international economic gateway, and it is connected to Sichuan, which is qualified for industrialization, to the south. It is the vein of material exchange between the Northwest and Southwest. Also, the Lanzhou-Baotou line of this system passes through the Hetao irrigation area of more than 16 million mu.</p>
<p>Southwest System</p>
<p>This case is the transportation system of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi, and is characterized by the development of western Sichuan industry, the Shuicheng iron mine in Guizhou, and the connection with Sichuan and Hunan, which are qualified for industrialization. In addition to the original Yangtze River water passage and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, its international economic gateways include Guangzhou Bay, Guangzhou, and the Burmese border. As for the traffic between Guangxi Province and the Pearl River Basin, it can be connected from the West River to Wuzhou and then to Sanshui, or from Liuzhou to He County to Sanshui. In addition, General Liu Fei, the current Deputy Chief of Staff, once advocated building a direct line from Liuzhou to Shaoguan. It can still be studied and decided during future construction.</p>
<p>Southeast System</p>
<p>This system is the traffic system in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and the eastern part of Guangdong Province. Open up the four water systems of the Gan River, Min River, Pearl River, and Qiantang River, with Xiamen, a deep-water port, as its main international economic gateway. From Nanjing via Shexian, Guixi, Nanping, Zhangping Meixian to Guangzhou, forming a coastal line, which is actually the spine of this system. Although there are few mineral products in the southeast, agricultural products are still rich and the population is dense. The four water systems are oriented in opposite directions, and economic exchanges are most lacking. Now that we are opening up from the watershed spine, it will greatly promote the economic development of the southeast.</p>
<p>There are four other lines, whose functions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Kaifeng-Jinan Line: The significance of this line is to enable the Central China region to directly connect with Qingdao.</p>
<p>(2) Nanyang-Huayuan Line: Although the local significance of this line is a shortcut for the Han River basin to connect with the outside world, its extension line, whether it enters Guanzhong through Zijingguan or enters Sichuan across the Daba Mountains, has global significance. However, the extension line remains to be determined.</p>
<p>(3) Changzhi-Qinghua Line: Passes through a rich coal area and becomes a shortcut for Jin Province to reach the south. This is the line proposed by Weng Wenhao, the current chairman of the National Resources Commission.</p>
<p>(4) Chengde-Chifeng-Tongliao Line: Although it is an internal line in the Rehe Province, it is an important line to enter the Northeast while avoiding the coast.</p>
<p>The advantages of the above selected routes are that they first seek easy passage in terms of topography, and all of them take the development of the economy to promote industrialization as the primary meaning, while also showing the needs of national defense.</p>
<p>Five Frontier Lines</p>
<p>Among the above lines, there are five lines extending to the frontier, and it is expected that their operating income will be difficult to develop for a while, but we must not therefore think that they have no value in construction. The total length of these five lines is 3,692 kilometers, namely:</p>
<p>Lanzhou-Hami Line: 1,636 kilometers</p>
<p>Lanzhou-Xining Line: 250 kilometers</p>
<p>Xining-Yushu Line: 800 kilometers</p>
<p>Jishan-Kangding Line: 406 kilometers</p>
<p>Chengde-Tongliao Line: 600 kilometers</p>
<p>Five-Year Program</p>
<p>The route expected to be completed each year in this five-year construction plan is as follows:</p>
<p>In the first year, construction of 6,206 kilometers will begin.</p>
<p>In the second year, construction of 3,326 kilometers will begin, and the number of kilometers under construction will increase from 6,206 kilometers to 9,532 kilometers. In this year, 2,812 kilometers will be completed.</p>
<p>In the third year, construction of 3,917 kilometers will begin, and the number of kilometers under construction will increase to 10,637 kilometers. In this year, 773 kilometers will be completed.</p>
<p>In the fourth year, construction of 882 kilometers will begin, and the number of kilometers under construction will increase to 10,746 kilometers. In this year, 2,865 kilometers will be completed.</p>
<p>In the fifth year, 7,881 kilometers will be completed, reaching the goal of 14,331 kilometers.</p>
<p>Construction Cost Estimate</p>
<p>Regarding the estimated construction costs, in addition to the measured lines, the construction costs are estimated according to the engineering quantities in the measurement report. For all unmeasured lines, the construction costs are estimated by comparing the topography with the measured lines.</p>
<p>Calculated according to the price standard before the war (ie, the 26th year of the Republic of China), 14,331 kilometers of railways will require a total of 1,460,035,600 national currency, equivalent to 498,147,000 US dollars (US dollars are converted to national currency at 30 to 100).</p>
<p>Regarding the staff and workers required for the construction of the line:</p>
<p>A total of 27,094 high, medium, and low-level technical personnel.</p>
<p>A total of 48,624 high, medium, and low-level management personnel.</p>
<p>942,000 skilled workers.</p>
<p>4,720,000 ordinary workers.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] A spokesperson for the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission stated: "Since the outbreak of the French-Vietnamese War, our government has been greatly concerned about the safety of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. The diplomatic authorities have lodged strong protests to both the French and Vietnamese sides, reiterating their determination to protect overseas Chinese. Negotiations have been conducted to designate areas where overseas Chinese are concentrated as neutral zones, prohibiting combat operations by either side within these zones, and demanding compensation for all losses suffered by overseas Chinese.

<h3>Teachers Fired by Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School Stage Hunger Strike at Education Bureau Director's Home</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] The dispute over the dismissal of teachers at Beiping Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School has been ongoing for over a week. Starting last night, five dismissed teachers went to the home of Wang Jigaog, the director of the Education Bureau, to petition. Wang avoided meeting them. These five individuals are still waiting at Wang's home on a hunger strike. Peng Huaju (wife of Councilor Huang Yu), the principal of No. 1 Girls' Middle School, previously dismissed 12 teachers, including Liang Yiqiu, on the grounds of "negligence of duty." Most of these 12 individuals have taught at the school for 15 or 20 years or more. Unwilling to leave silently, they appealed to society and the Education Bureau, claiming that their dismissal was due to Peng holding grudges and wanting to appoint her own people. They refused to leave the school and simultaneously outlined Peng's ten major offenses, including corruption and appointing her own people. Peng defended herself, claiming that her actions were due to Liang and others relying on their seniority and being disrespectful to their teaching positions. At the same time, the students were also divided into factions, each carrying out extensive propaganda. The education authorities found this matter extremely difficult to handle and have been slow to resolve it. During this stalemate, they went to Director Wang Jigaog's home to petition at 10 PM last night. Wang avoided meeting them upon hearing the news. Liang and others sat waiting, expressing that they would go on a hunger strike until they saw the director. Eventually, even Wang's wife left with her young child this morning. Director Wang did not go to the bureau to work all day, and Principal Peng received a written order from the Education Bureau this afternoon. As of 8 PM tonight, Liang and others were still waiting at Wang's residence. They have not eaten anything in these 22 hours. The reporter just inquired by phone, and Liang replied in a weak voice: "We will persevere to the end." Guo Dengao, chairman of the Beiping Education Association, has gone to Wang's residence to mediate. The Education Bureau wants to disperse Liang and others to serve in various elementary schools, but Liang and others have refused. How this will unfold remains to be seen.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Deepening of Britain's Crisis</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Attlee broadcasted to the nation yesterday, urging all the people to work together to overcome Britain's current crisis; and said that the current situation is comparable to 1940 when Britain was fighting Germany alone, appealing to the people to tighten their belts, work together with one heart, and overcome this difficulty. This broadcast, reaching the ears of the British people who have long been plagued by wartime control, made them feel the seriousness of the situation even more; under the circumstances, they naturally have no choice but to tighten their belts even more. However, behind their serious and heavy mood, they can't help but sigh and lament. After a long war against Germany and Japan and winning the victory, the British people originally expected that with the arrival of victory, they might have a chance to breathe; but the reality they faced was not the relaxation of wartime control, but the intensification of control, tightening step by step, and the degree of tightening was even greater than during the war. Although the British people know that the situation is like this and cannot be saved, they inevitably have a sense of disillusionment.</p>
<p>Attlee's broadcast was an appeal to the whole nation. Originally, Britain's economic situation has been deteriorating in recent months. The 1 billion US dollar loan obtained from the United States last year has been consumed very quickly. According to Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton's estimation, this amount will be used up by October of this year. At that time, the precariousness of Britain's economic situation will be unimaginable. Although US Secretary of State Marshall has expressed that the United States is willing to provide further assistance to Britain, and the heads of Britain and the United States will soon hold discussions, Britain, for its own sake, cannot rely on US assistance for a long time: and whether US assistance can be as expected is also questionable. The US Congress is now controlled by the Republican Party, and they cannot fully support the government's policy of aiding Britain. It is also worrying to see that the relationship between the Congress and the President has not been satisfactory recently; moreover, Britain is reluctant to beg for alms because of its dignity. Therefore, in order to overcome the current difficulties, the Attlee government has drafted an emergency plan, authorizing the government to act expediently. The introduction of this bill has aroused strong criticism from opposition leader Churchill, who believes that if the bill is passed, it will be the death knell of British democracy and the birth of centralized politics. Even within the Labour Party, opinions were not unanimous. The right-wing elements have dissenting opinions, while the left-wing elements are dissatisfied with the government's lack of active attitude. When the bill was passed for the first reading in the House of Commons last week, the government did not receive many votes: therefore, some people are quite worried about the Attlee government. Now that the bill will be put to a second reading, it is the focus of attention of the general public.</p>
<p>According to our observation, the Labour Party now occupies an absolute majority in the British Parliament, and even if there are a few dissatisfied elements, the passage of this emergency bill will not have any impact; maybe the news tomorrow will be that the bill has been passed. But whether the passage of this bill can turn Britain's situation from danger to safety is also questionable. First, in order to seek Britain's self-reliance, after the bill is passed, the Attlee government will not only intensify consumption control, but also actively implement its socialist policies, such as the socialization of the steel industry. But the problem is: the decline in Britain's production efficiency does not seem to be entirely a matter of national policy, but a matter of equipment. Britain is an advanced country in the industrial revolution, because it was the first to adopt the trend, so its industrial equipment is mostly old and unsuitable for modern production conditions. Therefore, even if the Labour government implements the policy of socialization, it cannot make up for this innate defect. Just look at the fact that since the Labour government came to power, it has vigorously implemented the nationalization of coal mines, but Britain encountered a serious coal shortage last year; and what is even more noteworthy is that in the US loan, a large sum of money was used to import coal. Britain is famous for producing coal, but now it has to import it from abroad in large quantities, and the decline of British industry can be imagined.</p>
<p>Second, the current crisis in Britain is so profound, but the Attlee government is going forward bravely and doing its best to cope with the difficulties. This spirit is admirable. But what we want to point out here is: the Labour Party's great victory in the general election in 1945 was a reaction to the long-term war suffering of the British people. Whether their vision of the situation after the Labour Party came to power is the same as today is also questionable. Bread rationing, which was not implemented during the war, was implemented after the Labour Party came to power, and the rationing was significantly reduced thereafter. If the British people had expected such a day after the victory, even if they disliked the National Government, which had been dominated by the Conservative Party for a long time, whether they would have the same enthusiastic support for the Labour Party in the election is an interesting question. Although the Labour government can pass this emergency bill because it has absolute control of the parliament, whether this fully reflects the general intention of the British people at present is also worthy of study.</p>
<p>Third, due to the current crisis in Britain, the government is considering recalling overseas troops. This reminds us of the measures taken by the MacDonald government in those years, which greatly reduced Britain's military equipment, which eventually led to the rise of Hitler and the subsequent outbreak of World War II. The first Labour government was organized after World War I. At that time, MacDonald was an idealist, which caused an irreparable disaster. Now, after the Second World War, the British Labour Party has risen again to seize British power; but Britain is facing an unprecedented crisis. We hope that the Attlee government can not only safely overcome this difficulty, but also write a glorious and valuable page for British history!</p>

During his stay, he listened to the opinions of several people and forwarded them to Washington. According to Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir, Indonesia is determined to compensate for the losses of all countries, but the losses of the enemy (referring to the Netherlands) are not included. All people residing in Indonesia, regardless of race, will be protected by law. As for the losses suffered by Chinese overseas, Indonesia will follow special clauses and compensate them. After Foote flew away from the Indonesian capital, the Indonesian cabinet immediately convened a meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 11th Broadcast: Indonesia issued a communique today, "saying that the US President's talk focused on US mediation." As for the results of the talk, there has been no announcement.</p>

Mr. Foote departed tonight with Indonesia's reply and set off to return to Batavia. According to Indonesian sources here, the Indonesian cabinet's acceptance of the US mediation proposal indicates that the United States will send a fact-finding mission to Indonesia in the near future. It is said that the position of head of the mission has been appointed by President Truman to Admiral Leehi, a confidant of former President Roosevelt. The Dutch side expressed its acceptance of this US proposal last week.

<h3>We Demand That Indonesia Make a Firm Guarantee to Protect the Safety of Overseas Chinese, Jiang Jiadong Transmits Letter to Indonesian President</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Batavia, 11th] Our Consul General in Batavia, Jiang Jiadong, took advantage of US Consul Foote's trip to Yogyakarta today and entrusted him with delivering an informal letter to Indonesian President Sukarno, requesting once again that he take effective measures to protect the safety of overseas Chinese in the mainland. Among them, it is stated that China's attitude towards the Indonesian independence movement will depend on how the Indonesian government treats the Chinese overseas. The two sides demanded that Sukarno immediately take the following steps: (1) Provide convenience to overseas Chinese, so that those who are forced to evacuate can return home, and return all property looted by the Indonesian side. (2) Punish the perpetrators. (3) Guarantee that there will be no more terrorist incidents against overseas Chinese in the Indonesian region. (4) Guarantee full compensation for the losses of overseas Chinese. It is understood that Mr. Jiang had requested Mr. Foote to provide a plane seat to go to Yogyakarta, but was refused because the small plane had too little capacity.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Batavia, 10th Associated Press] Indonesian Republic Deputy Prime Minister Gani said today: There has never been an attack on Chinese overseas within the territory of the true Indonesian Republic; what happened was only Dutch aggression. He also said that the situation seems more complicated than it appears at first glance, but this does not mean that Indonesia is shirking its responsibility. Mr. Gai said that Prime Minister Sjahrir has ordered the military police to take steps to protect the lives and property of Chinese overseas.</p>
<h3>Laiyi Issues United Nations Work Report</h3>

In his conclusion, Mr. Laiyi stated: It is obvious that the United Nations has made great efforts in the past year to enable international institutions to solve all the world's political, economic, and social problems. If the governments of all member states cooperate, the organization can assume responsibility for handling all major problems.</p>

According to an official announcement today, the first shipment is a new type of road building machine, worth about $553,000, which has been prepared. The next shipment is ammunition, aircraft, radar equipment and other arms, making up the majority of the $100 million loan to Turkey. US aid to Turkey lags behind the $300 million aid to Greece by several weeks because Turkey's needs are not as urgent as Greece's. The full-speed process was initiated after the delegation led by Major General Oliver returned home after inspecting Turkey for two months. According to official instructions, Oliver's detailed report on Turkey's needs is consistent with the following preliminary allocations: $51.75 million for light and heavy artillery, $22 million for machine tools and technical equipment, $12 million for the air force, $6.55 million for naval needs, $4 million for ports and highways, and $3.7 million for other needs.</p>

<h3>British Steel Nationalization Temporarily Postponed - Attlee's Situation Difficult</h3>

<h3>American Newspapers Highly Value British Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 10th] The British economic crisis continues to be highly valued by major American newspapers. The "New York Times" commented: The British crisis is enough to change the world situation, and this balance of power is the foundation for planning peace. The peace that we can accept must also be based on this. Therefore, the British crisis itself can be seen as an obstacle to peace. The remedy must be found in the economic stability outside the communist world. This can overthrow Marxism and shatter the Soviet Union's dream of the collapse of capitalism.</p>
<h3>Attlee's Broadcast Address Appeals to the Nation to Work Together to Overcome the Crisis</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 10th] Prime Minister Attlee broadcast to the British people tonight, using simple and straightforward language to urge the entire nation to work together to implement the government's broad plan to overcome the economic crisis. The Prime Minister stated that all the details of this plan could not be announced at once, but the people must have a spirit of willingness to sacrifice, extend working hours, bury themselves in hard work, and be prepared to learn new skills, become familiar with trade techniques, and perhaps temporarily refrain from demanding wage increases or improved working conditions. The Prime Minister's broadcast did not release any plans beyond those announced in the House of Commons last Wednesday, but only publicized the perilous state of the British economy to the people and informed them of their major responsibilities. He expressed confidence that victory could be achieved in this economic battle, and that Britain's natural resources and the industrial skills of its people could be fully utilized, providing a sufficient guarantee of this victory.</p>
<p>After pointing out that the crisis facing Britain today is no less serious than any serious situation in British history, the Prime Minister said that the British must intensify their labor to implement the following: (1) reduce foreign expenditure, even if every national suffers significant sacrifices; (2) increase domestic food production; (3) fully improve transport efficiency; (4) intensify production for export. He said: "During the war, we had to stop manufacturing other things in order to focus on manufacturing guns and other weapons. Today, we still need to concentrate all our efforts on producing what we need to achieve economic victory. I know that the implementation of this plan requires everyone to suffer hardships. The government has now decided on the outline of the plan, and its implementation requires the joint efforts of the whole country. The details of the plan cannot be determined at once, and must be decided for each industry as it develops. Therefore, every British person must be prepared to sacrifice their own interests to serve the interests of the whole, and the government should also distribute sacrifices equally as much as possible. For this reason, the government has already proposed a bill that, although it does not give the government greater powers than it had in 1945, will allow it to be applied to the current crisis. The government has made the greatest determination not to allow any obstacles to hinder our country's recovery. We now need the same personal effort as in wartime. We cannot only rely on the generous assistance of other members of our Commonwealth? Even if American friends have plans to aid Europe, we should still try to be self-reliant.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency Seoul, 11th] According to sources from the military government, residents of Dokdo Island in the eastern sea of ​​Korea recently requested the military government to investigate the issue of sovereignty over the island.

<h3>More Than 3,000 Bags of Ningbo Disaster Relief Rice Intercepted While Being Transported to Shanghai for Sale - Criminals Zhang Wensheng and Two Others Apprehended</h3>

<h3>Arousing Civic Awareness, Assisting in Suppressing the Rebellion and Building the Nation, Organizing a General Mobilization Assembly of the Cultural Sector, Preparatory Meeting Convened on the 15th</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee, and Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, in response to the general mobilization of the cultural sector in the capital to suppress the rebellion and build the nation, specially held a tea party at the New Lichadun Hotel yesterday afternoon at 2 PM to entertain the cultural sector and discuss matters related to the general mobilization of the cultural sector in this city to suppress the rebellion and build the nation. A total of 137 units from various cultural and academic organizations, as well as cultural figures, Wang Guanqing representing Mayor Wu, and Liu Haisu, Fang Qiugai, Su Xishi, Shen Sizhuang, Liu Shi, Hua Lin, Li Hao, Wu Siyuan, and others, more than 200 people, attended.</p>
<p>Saving Others is Also Saving Oneself</p>
<p>Chairman Fang first reported that the capital's cultural sector's general assembly to suppress the rebellion and build the nation had issued a declaration, clarifying the way to save the country and the path we should follow. The ranks of the Shanghai cultural sector are the largest. We should respond to the capital's cultural sector and hold a general assembly to suppress the rebellion, thereby expressing the path that should be followed in "saving others is also saving oneself." The government's suppression of the rebellion is due to the rampant communist bandits, who are destroying the country's recovery and construction. The cultural sector stands at the forefront of all sectors and should lead society. If we use the pens of the Shanghai cultural sector to launch a nationwide general mobilization to suppress the rebellion, it will surely be effective. We deeply know that guns can eliminate riots, while pens can expose anesthetizing smokescreens, and their potential power is extremely great. The main purpose of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation is to awaken the people's awareness. Only in this way can we use the power of culture to suppress the rebellion and build the nation on one hand, and assist the government in completing the great task of building the nation on the other.</p>
<p>Without Suppressing the Rebellion, There is No Building the Nation</p>
<p>Director Pan then reported that before the order of the country and society is stabilized, we should determine a goal: without suppressing the rebellion, there is no building the nation. Shanghai citizens are immersed in singing and dancing all day long. The cultural sector in this city has the responsibility to awaken the citizens. We must remind the citizens that the communist bandits are destroying transportation and coal mines everywhere. If they come to Shanghai one day, can all the tea houses, restaurants, dance halls, and companies still exist? Absolutely impossible. Cultural people are social mentors. For example, photography can expose their atrocities, and singers can turn their atrocities into songs and sing them all over the country. These are all achievements of the cultural sector's struggle. It is hoped that the Shanghai cultural sector will unite, determine goals, and uphold the principles of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation based on democracy. The cultural sector should show its conscience to the public and expose all the atrocities of the communist bandits that they know before the people. In short, today we want to build a new China, and a nationwide general mobilization to suppress the rebellion is indispensable.</p>
<p>Fifteen Units Recommended for Preparation</p>
<p>Then Wang Guanqing representing Mayor Wu, Liu Haisu, Su Xishi, Shen Sizhuang, and others spoke successively. It was resolved to establish a preparatory committee for the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Sector's General Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion and Build the Nation, and the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee, the Journalists Association, the Fine Arts Association, the Entertainment Association, the Literary Writers Association, the Drama and Film Association, the News Agency Association, the Publishing Industry Association, the Secondary School Federation, the Specialist and Higher Education Federation, the World Society, the Municipal Education Association, the Education Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and other fifteen units were recommended as preparatory members. It was decided to convene a preparatory meeting on the 15th, and the time and location will be determined separately.</p>

<h3>Important Developments in the Yu Sheng Case: Pistol Found in Malay's Dormitory, Shirt Stained with Blood, Queripel's Testimony Required, Extradition to the District Court Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The U.S. military police yesterday continued to search the dormitory of U.S. soldier Malay, who shot and killed Yu Shengxiao, who was engaged in black market gold speculation, and found a white summer shirt with blood stains on the cuffs. After鉴定, the blood type was the same as the blood stains left on the pantyhose a few days ago.</p>
<p>In addition, an important new development was obtained, that is, a pistol, caliber .32, was found in the ceiling, but it had been dismantled into parts. The U.S. military police have now sent it to the police station's gun registry. Once it is fully assembled, they will check for traces of recent firing. According to general observation, although it is not敢断言 that this gun is the murder weapon that shot and killed Yu Shengxiao before it is验明, it may already be very close to the truth.</p>
<p>The U.S. military police also sent personnel to meet with Queripel yesterday, telling him that Malay will be interrogated soon and that he will need to testify in court at that time. At the same time, he was warned: "If you do not appear in court, you will have to bear all the crimes alone." At that time, Queripel heard this, remained silent, thought for a long time, and frequently wiped sweat with a handkerchief, seemingly unable to overcome the difficulty. But after repeated warnings from the U.S. military police, he finally nodded in agreement due to the relationship of interests.</p>
<p>Queripel was originally scheduled to be extradited to the District Court for handling yesterday. Now, because the U.S. military court needs Queripel to testify, it has been decided to temporarily postpone the extradition. According to records, Queripel was fired from the工部局 patrol房 in 1938 due to fraud, theft, and misconduct. U.S. soldier Malay had also committed theft in Chicago, so the two people's actions were comparable and can be described as birds of a feather.</p>

Zheng's criminal situation is obviously pitiful, so he is given a reduction. (2) The defendant protected underground workers while serving in puppet posts.

<h3>Lake Bandit Liao Bingnan Gathers at Platform Mountain, Colluding with Communist Bandit Xue Yonghui's Troops</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 10th] Last September, Yang Yanbin, the special envoy stationed in Taihu for the purpose of pacification, dispatched Guo Rong to Platform Mountain in Taihu Lake to pacify the lake bandit Liao Bingnan. By early November, the pacification was successful, and the group was organized and trained in Xukou, Wuxian County, and placed under the command of the Suppression Force, bringing temporary peace to the Taihu region. Unexpectedly, after the organization, Liao's troops, with their untamed nature, gradually dispersed and returned to Taihu Lake to become bandits, gathering with the unorganized bandits and causing trouble everywhere. Recently, bandit alarms have been frequently heard along the Taihu Lake coastline. In addition, the Jin Jiarang gang is also robbing in the lake. The Jinghu Railway Command, according to information from Wujiang, has confirmed that Jin Jiarang is indeed a bandit, and it is widely rumored that Liao Bingnan and his subordinates, such as Zhang Kuan, have colluded with the Communist bandit Xue Yonghui's troops to commit evil deeds. Details will be explored in subsequent reports.</p>
<p>Platform Mountain is located in the center of Taihu Lake, at the intersection of Wuxi, Wuxian, Changzhou, and Huzhou counties, covering an area of approximately ten acres. There is a Yuwang Temple on the mountain, facing south, with idols inside and two plaques: one reads "The First Mountain in the World," and the other reads "Heaven on Earth." There are no caretakers in the temple, and the inside and outside of the temple are overgrown with weeds. It is reported that Liao's troops do not live on the mountain but live in large sailing ships with seven or twelve layers of awnings, and the cabins are very deep. The mountain is 81 li from Wutangmen outside the south gate of Xijing.</p>
<p>There is a widely circulated myth nearby. Legend has it that there was no mountain in the lake at first. At one time, a large official's boat passed by the area, and suddenly a violent storm arose, causing extreme danger. The official threw his hat and clothes into the lake, but the storm still did not subside. Later, he jumped into the lake, and the storm stopped, saving the lives of everyone on board. Later, a small mountain rose in the lake, but the terrain was not high, resembling a platform, hence the name Platform Mountain. Before the war, in peaceful times, there was a temple fair every year, and most of the netting boat households would climb the mountain to offer incense, which was extremely prosperous. Now, it has fallen into bandit territory, with weeds covering the ankles and no signs of human habitation.</p>
<h3>Coffin Shops in Old and New Kaiyuan Have No Business, Owners Change Professions, "Digging Roads" to Rob Coffins, "Repairing Bridges and Paving Roads"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Correspondent Zhao Zhan, Changchun, 6th] Kaiyuan left a vivid and profound impression on the reporter. Old Kaiyuan is located on the north bank of the Qinghe River, and the city walls still exist. I arrived at this crude ancient city at dusk, as if I had stepped into the pages of a history book. There are no modern hotels here. I stayed in a feather inn converted from a coffin shop and listened to the owner complain. He said he was very unlucky. Now the dead cannot afford coffins. When the "Eighth Route Army" came, they dismantled the coffins in his shop, saying they were going to "build bridges and pave roads."</p>
<p>Leaving the south gate of Old Kaiyuan, crossing the Qinghe River, and taking a "yellow fish" cart for ten kilometers, one arrives at New Kaiyuan (the station). The streets here radiate outwards, and the appearance is neat, showing traces of the war. Bored soldiers have become grain vendors, matching wits with the inspectors. Pickpockets are extremely active, chasing corners with traffic police. The order at the station is very chaotic. There is a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl with lively eyes and high, elastic breasts, constantly exchanging glances with passersby. She is a grain smuggler, which is truly a shameful and sad scene.</p>

<h3>Early Autumn in Paradise: Two Incense Seasons</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou, 9th] Several nights of wind and rain have cooled down the late summer heat over West Lake. The lush green willows and the French parasol trees that dance in the wind have a few scorched yellow leaves mixed among the piles of parasol leaves.</p>
<p>Lingyin and Tianzhu Temples Enshrouded in Incense Smoke</p>
<p>The first incense season of autumn in Hangzhou is the night of the Goddess of Mercy's birthday on the 18th day of the sixth lunar month. Everyone in Hangzhou goes to the Three Tianzhu Temples and Lingyin Temple, or at least crowds to the lakeside. That night, all vehicles were carrying guests to Beishan to offer incense. Cars followed cars in an endless stream. Many people who couldn't hire a car went on foot. Hiring a pedicab from the lakeside to Lingyin cost 60,000 yuan, and a rickshaw cost 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The simple vegetarian restaurants temporarily set up in Lingyin and Tianzhu numbered twenty or thirty. Fruit stalls and stalls selling small dried tofu, a specialty of Tianzhu, were arranged side by side. In Lingyin Temple, the loud sound of the bell struck the hearts of everyone. The main hall was filled with incense smoke, and the sound of "Namo Greatly Compassionate Guanshiyin Bodhisattva" echoed, as if begging for an early end to the war.</p>
<p>Cushions and Fortune-Telling Sticks Insufficient</p>
<p>The Upper Tianzhu Temple, Middle Tianzhu Temple, and Lower Tianzhu Temple were also flourishing with incense. The kneeling cushions for making obeisance were insufficient, so some people knelt on the ground and began to kowtow. "Remove, remove, remove!" The fortune-telling sticks were insufficient, and rows of people waited in line to draw lots. On the way to Upper Tianzhu Temple, the Temple of Guan Yu and others also inevitably benefited a lot. Such incense burning lasted all night. On the two thoroughfares of Inner West Lake and Bai Causeway, people rubbed shoulders all night long. The rickshaw pullers, seeing the public buses carrying people, became jealous and smashed two public buses.</p>
<p>Two Incidents of Vehicle Destruction</p>
<p>In the morning, travelers from Tianzhu and Lingyin wanted to return to the city. Rickshaw pullers and pedicab drivers bargained wildly, infuriating the travelers, who beat up several rickshaws and pedicabs. The rickshaws and pedicabs were frightened and fled one after another. This was an interesting episode, but not one to be emulated.</p>
<p>Boats and Drums, Lotus Lanterns on the Lake</p>
<p>The lakeside was truly packed on this evening. Boatmen knew that business would be booming that night, so they charged 250,000 yuan per night. Several companies and firms specially hired boats, decorated them with colorful lanterns, and beat gongs and drums inside the boats as they drifted back and forth on the lake. Some companies released lotus lanterns, with advertisements on them. As soon as the lanterns were placed in the water, people would rush to grab them. It is said that grabbing lotus lanterns is a custom on the lake, so people who came to the lakeside to watch the lanterns couldn't see them. According to the traffic authorities' statistics on that day, the income reached 395.5 million yuan. Other expenses were probably more than ten times that amount.</p>
<p>Second Incense Season: Pilgrimage to the Eastern Peak</p>
<p>The first incense season of early autumn has passed, and the second incense season is coming. The second incense season is the pilgrimage to the Old Eastern Peak Temple. The Old Eastern Peak is a statue in the underworld. At that time, it not only stirred up the enthusiasm of the citizens of Hangzhou, but also fascinated the villagers of nearby counties. Next, there are the birthdays of "Lord Thunder" and "Dangmu", for which people go to Chenghuang Mountain to offer incense.</p>
<p>The red maple leaves that dot the scenic spots will soon have their glorious season. Many people also go to Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies to see the maple leaves, and to Xixi to see the reed catkins. Last year's chrysanthemum season in Hangzhou was not very good. Various nurseries are replanting and cultivating, hoping that the chrysanthemums will bloom this year, coming together with the season of fat crabs! Chrysanthemum appreciation.</p>
<p>Hospital Director's Wife Donates Blood to Save Lives</p>
<p>Hangzhou has been experiencing an epidemic of encephalitis in recent days, and the mortality rate of this disease is as high as 70%. It is said that the Western director's wife of Guangji Hospital also suffered from this disease. After recovering, she is willing to donate blood to inject into patients for treatment. She also hopes that people who recover in the future will donate blood to save lives. We believe that other diseases may become epidemic in the autumn. Those who make money during the incense season should donate some to help the poor patients.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Explains Procedures for Raising and Lowering the National Flag and Playing the National Anthem: The National Anthem Should Be Sung Before Raising or Lowering the National Flag; The "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" Score Should Be Played While the Flag is Being Raised or Lowered.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Guizhou Normal School had previously asked whether the national anthem should still be played when raising or lowering the national flag and playing the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" score, and whether the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" score should be played before or after raising or lowering the national flag, or while the flag is being raised or lowered. The Ministry of Education requested that the competent authorities review and instruct the school. The Executive Yuan recently explained: "The 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth' score is the score played while the national flag is being raised or lowered. Singing the national anthem before raising or lowering the national flag is clearly stipulated in the flag-raising and lowering ceremony." Based on this explanation, the Ministry of Education has issued a special notice to all provinces and cities across the country.</p>

<h3>Six Players from the Singapore Island Football Team Arrive in England in the First Batch; To Begin Operations on the 23rd of This Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The first batch of six players from the Singapore Island Football Club's expedition to England arrived today on a British Overseas Airways Corporation flying boat at Pool Water Airport. The remaining thirteen players are expected to arrive here gradually within this week. Singapore Island will stay in England for two months and has already arranged nine matches against top British amateur teams.</p>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 11th] The Singapore Island Football Team, entirely composed of Chinese athletes, has departed for England to participate in a four-week friendly competition with British football teams, starting on the 23rd of this month, for observation. This is the first time a wholly Chinese team has appeared in England. It is learned that six of the team members arrived here yesterday on a British Overseas Airways Corporation plane, and the remaining players will arrive here by ship in the next few days. People here are speculating about who will win the match between the Singapore Island team and several major amateur teams in London.</p>
<p>Random Notes on the Expedition</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] After the Singapore Island Football Team lost to the Malayan Chinese Team, it held a strict review meeting. In addition to the reasons for the exhaustion of troops and horses due to the quick-battle, Captain Feng Jingxiang and Hu Hao jointly pointed out that the refusal of a small number of up-and-coming players to follow the on-the-spot guidance, resulting in a distraction of military morale, was the main reason for the failure. This game can serve as a warning to arrogant players!</p>
<p>The good thing about this Singapore Island tour is the good management. The whole team adopts a collective life. Without special permission, they cannot move freely and attach great importance to discipline. This is the basic condition for a strong team.</p>
<p>"Little Sanzi" Qiu Ting set off with the army, but his foot injury has not healed. He only acts as a "spectator" in each game. When fighting the Malayan Allied Team, he was anxious to see it. He and "Desperate Saburo" Zhang Jinhai both stroked their painful feet and shared their pity.</p>
<p>The results of the expedition to date are only one defeat and one draw in more than a dozen battles. With limited manpower replenishment, this result can be considered satisfactory. It is estimated that the most goals were scored by Li Zhaorong, and the best performances were by forwards Feng Jingxiang and Zhu Yongqiang. The defenders Xu Jingcheng, Feng Kunsheng, and Liu Songsheng are all good, and the guest player Gao Shanlong is not weak either.</p>
<p>On the sea voyage from Singapore to Yangon, they took first-class seats. Here, the gentlemanly style is strong, wearing uniforms for dinner, pacing slowly, and speaking with a serious face. This group of "ball hooligans" is suffering and has a special taste in their hearts.</p>
<p>After completing the game in Yangon, the Tiger Team went to Siam to hold a charity match. On July 17, they first fought against the local veterans team, the Assumption College Team. The team was full of talents, but unfortunately, they were old and useless. They were beaten badly by Singapore Island. One after another, three goals in the first half and seven in the second half, ten to zero. The Tiger Team won the first major victory since the expedition.</p>
<h3>The Table Tennis Championship Has Yet to Produce a Winner: Shanghai Stars Defeat Jingwu Yesterday; Jingwu Suffers a Crushing Defeat of 2-5; a Re-match Will Be Scheduled Due to Equal Points</h3>
<p>The second annual table tennis league organized by the Shanghai Municipal Sports Association Table Tennis Committee held its final match last night at 8:00 PM in the Shanghai Stadium's gym between the Shanghai Stars and Jingwu teams, after 27 rounds of intense competition. An estimated two thousand spectators gathered, suddenly enlivening the long-quiet Shanghai Stadium. The Shanghai Stars surprisingly prevailed, defeating Jingwu with a score of 5-2. As the teams are tied on points, the organizers have decided to hold a final rematch at a later date.</p>
<p>After the start of the match, Jingwu's Yang Kaiyun faced Shanghai Stars' Huang Zhisong. Yang Kaiyun played one level higher, repeatedly using chops and cuts, taking the lead with a score of 3-0. In the second match, Zhang Fuwei faced Cheng Aixin. This match was more intense than the first, and Cheng Aixin's stamina failed him, resulting in a 1-3 defeat to Zhang Fuwei. In the third match, Shui Hanga and Li Zongpei took to the stage. Before the match, it was predicted that Li would win easily, but Shui's resistance was expected to be sharp. After contact, Li Zongpei used short chops, leaving Shui Hanga with no room to resist. As a result, Li Zongpei easily defeated Shui Hanga in three straight games. The fourth match between Ouyang Wei and Fu Qifang was one of the most tense of the evening. From the start, both sides proved formidable. After a 2-2 tie, Fu Qifang exerted his remaining strength, repeatedly using fierce smashes, causing Ouyang Wei to make numerous errors. In the end, Fu Qifang narrowly defeated Ouyang Wei 3-2, tying the overall score at 2-2. In the fifth match, Xue Xuchu faced Chen Zengliang, resulting in a one-sided affair. Xue Xuchu easily defeated Chen Zengliang 3-0. In the sixth match, Wang Changhou faced Xu Sunjia. Wang was just recovering from an illness, and it was widely expected that Xu would win. However, Wang Changhou responded calmly, preventing Xu Sunjia from attacking and instead suffering a 0-3 defeat at the hands of Wang Changhou. The final match did not affect the overall outcome, as Shanghai Stars had already secured the victory. However, Yu Cheng still defeated Gao Hongxing 3-1, resulting in a final score of 5-2, with Shanghai Stars defeating Jingwu. The scores for yesterday's match are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Stars) (Jingwu) Score</p>
<p>Cheng Aixin Zhang Fuwei 1-3</p>
<p>Li Zongpei Shui Hanga 3-0</p>
<p>Fu Qifang Ouyang Wei 3-2</p>
<p>Xue Xuchu Chen Zengliang 3-0</p>
<p>Wang Changhou Xu Sunjia 3-0</p>
<p>Yu Cheng Gao Hongxing 3-1</p>

<h3>Demonstrating the Spirit of International Cooperation: Representatives from Forty Countries Attending Boy Scout Jamboree</h3>
<p>International Jamboree Held in France</p>
<p>[Reuters, Muya Song City, France, 10th] More than 40,000 Boy Scouts from forty countries are camping in a 20-acre forest here, fully demonstrating the spirit of international cooperation. After the opening ceremony of the Boy Scout Jamboree last night, Boy Scouts from various countries with different languages, races, and religions spontaneously engaged in activities, creating a very harmonious atmosphere. According to Jamboree Secretary-General Krieg, the Air Force is the only international organization that can unite the youth of allied and former enemy countries. We should educate children to love peace and international understanding, hoping that after they become adults, they can be politicians who do not fail their mission and demand and establish lasting peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Muya Song, 10th, United Press] This morning, over 35,000 Boy Scouts from more than forty countries, including 15,000 in Muya Song, west of Paris, held a Christian open-air service.

<h3>Issue of Negotiable Instruments Being Used on the Same Day: The Bankers' Association Sends a Telegram to the Ministry of Finance; Suggesting Alternative Measures; Banks Can Still Accommodate Customers with Good Credit and Pay on the Same Day</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Bankers' and Commercial Association recently submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance regarding the issue of negotiable instruments being used on the same day, outlining five drawbacks of not allowing same-day use and suggesting a two-pronged approach for implementation. The main points of the report are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Among current customers, those who receive payment for negotiable instruments on one hand and need to issue checks for payment on the same day are mostly factories and intermediary merchants. Factories often need to purchase raw materials on the same day they sell finished products. Because price fluctuations are difficult to predict, buying and selling often need to be done on the same day. Intermediary merchants, such as cotton yarn and cloth merchants and securities brokers, must issue checks to pay their own accounts payable on the same day they receive negotiable instruments from customers to pay for goods. Both of these types of receipts and payments involve a large amount of money. However, they are all based on actual commercial transactions in the market, and the total amount of credit in the market will not be expanded because of this same-day use. If it is completely prohibited, industry and commerce will definitely suffer greatly. (2) As a result of this trend, legitimate commercial transactions will inevitably switch to using cash. Legal negotiable instruments will lose their circulation effect, and the market's demand for cash will surge (in the current situation, cash accounts for about one-tenth of the daily receipts and payments of the entire financial industry; if general transactions switch to cash, the above ratio will increase by more than double). (3) For the above reasons, the Central Bank will have to issue a large amount of cash to meet the actual needs of industry and commerce. Whether this is appropriate and whether there are obstacles are matters of great importance. Conversely, if the Central Bank's increase in cash issuance is not enough to meet market demand, a cash shortage will immediately occur in the market. Underground money houses will take the opportunity to start up and engage in the buying and selling of cash. There will be different prices for cash and negotiable instruments for the sale of various commodities. The various disturbances caused by the ban on same-day use of negotiable instruments during the enemy puppet period serve as a warning. (4) If commercial transactions mostly use cash, the labor costs and risks involved in the receipt, payment, and transportation of cash will increase significantly, affecting social order. (5) At the same time, it will also cause industry and commerce to receive cash, and in order to avoid labor costs, some may no longer go through the financial industry, and social funds will become increasingly isolated from banks and money houses.</p>
<p>In short, the use of negotiable instruments on the same day is not for the sake of taking care of the needs of legitimate industrial and commercial customers and increasing their own service efficiency. Why would they willingly bear the risk themselves? Especially because it is related to the convenience of industrial and commercial receipts and payments, the circulation of legal negotiable instruments, and the maintenance of their own business, they are cautiously and carefully selecting methods to operate, so as not to fail the financial industry's mission to society. According to past facts, there are really no cases of bank closures or shutdowns due to the above reasons. It can be seen that as long as banks conduct strict screening and pay proper attention, this limited accommodation is still a good one. Therefore, we have carefully submitted our humble opinions, requesting that your department consider the commercial situation and supplement the regulations:</p>
<p>"If a bank customer deposits a negotiable instrument on the same day and issues another check for use on the same day, if the bank believes that the customer has good credit and that the amount of the original instrument can be paid on the same day, it may still be accommodated on the same day. However, this accommodation should be carefully selected by the bank and handled strictly."</p>
<p>In this way, it is hoped that the handling of business in the same industry can be ordinary and prudent, and that industrial and commercial receipts and payments will not have difficulties. We respectfully request your approval for implementation and cannot express our eagerness enough.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of customers issuing checks with insufficient deposits or exceeding agreed overdraft amounts, the association has previously formulated measures to crack down on them, and recently colleagues have discussed preparing to strictly implement them. After implementation, it is expected that the number of checks returned for insufficient funds will be reduced, and the risk of same-day use can also be reduced. This matter is a fundamental solution and should be clarified together.</p>
<h3>Mostly Closing Transactions: Shanghai Stocks Decline Across the Board</h3>
<p>Shanghai stocks were weak yesterday and could not rally. Buyers have already realized this, and their psychology has changed. Too many people are closing out positions, so the process has gotten worse and worse and cannot be revitalized. Except for Tongyi Yarn Factory in the Weipai sector, which was uniquely popular due to rumors of increased dividends, the most popular stocks were overwhelmingly sold off. In addition to the market's nervousness, the intensification of the decline in material prices made it even more difficult to cope with. Low prices appeared near noon, and Yonggong's stock fell to the limit one after another. A cloud of gloom enveloped the market, and the trend was very unfavorable.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, Yongsha stock was delivered for immediate settlement and purposely traded down to the 200 yuan mark, while Yongsha stock for forward delivery rose slightly to 212 yuan. After the opening, the 223, 112 contracts of Yongsha stock for forward delivery were sold at 208 yuan, and the 117, 14, 65, 200 contracts were bought. The 91 contract also bought Yongsha stock for immediate settlement and once rebounded to a high price of 211 yuan and 214 yuan. The 223, 112, 97, 207, 94 contracts were unloaded, retreating to 205 yuan. The 97, 232, 174 contracts were maintained at low prices, and the 224 contract vigorously bought Yongsha stock for immediate settlement, rising back to 211 yuan. After the entrance, the 8, 36 contracts were supplied, and the 97, 219 contracts were still accepted. The Tongyi stock was frantically raised by the 24, 23 and other contracts. There was good news that the capital increase would change from one to thirty and the interest payment would be 20 yuan. It was constantly stirring. The Tongyi stock rose to the limit. The 190 contract also bought Yongsha stock for immediate settlement and was still stable. In the end, the various popular stocks, such as Meiya, were very loose and flooded, and the situation got worse and worse. People's hearts were finally overwhelmed. The 224, 223, 94, 12, 171, 219, 153, 103, 235 contracts closed out their positions in unison, and the 132 contract also sold Yongsha stock for immediate settlement. The 22 contract of Yonggong stock respectively lowered the prices of immediate settlement and forward delivery stocks to the daily limit. At 10:20, Yongsha stocks for immediate settlement and forward delivery simultaneously broke into the 200 yuan mark. The 160, 129, 142 contracts forced Yongsha stock for forward delivery down to 196 yuan.</p>
<p>At 10:45, the 32 contract sold to cover short positions, and once rebounded a little. The 218, 231, 179 contracts were still sold, and the 147 contract vigorously sold Yongsha stock for immediate settlement, falling to 191 yuan and 193 yuan. At 11:15, the 223, 32, 153, 163, 40 contracts took advantage of the low price to buy up to 198 yuan, the 169, 180, 83 contracts were sold, and the 223, 162 contracts also sold Yongsha stock for immediate settlement, and near noon they fell to a low price of 190 yuan and 191 yuan. Under the supplementation of the 73, 131 contracts, the afternoon session ended with the 195 contract for delivery with the 198 yuan closure. The 76 and 204 contracts of Xinguang were absorbed, and there was a greater rebound.</p>
<p>After the close, the asking price of Yongsha stock for forward delivery was flat and weak. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongsha, Meiya, Huafeng, and Xinguang stocks for immediate delivery each fell by a little more than 5%, Zhongfa fell by 10%, Xinhua fell by a little more than 15%, Yonggong fell to the limit and then rebounded, and the price was reduced by a little less than 15%, Jingfu only fell by a little less than 5%, Tongyi rose to the limit and then rebounded, and the price increased by 5%, Shangwu, Zhongs, Guohuo, Jinglun, underwear, and Lian fell by 5%, cement, Datong, and Xinya slightly fell, and Wuhe and Rongfeng fell by 10%. Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang stocks for forward delivery each fell by a little more than 5% to a little less than 10%, Huafeng fell by 10%, Yonggong fell to the limit and then rebounded, and Qinxing slightly fell. As for the old stocks off the market, Dasheng was still stable, and the remaining stocks were just average.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Rebounded Slightly; Foreign Stocks Were Stable</h3>
<p>Government bonds finally rebounded slightly yesterday, and people bought when there was profit. Although Room 360 bought, Rooms 555, 503, and 550 all sold, and the upward trend was blocked and turned weak. The Tongbing opened at 13,100 yuan yesterday morning, and the closing price fell from 21,300 yuan to around 11,700 yuan. Compared with last Saturday, Jiayi and Yiyi fell by 1,000 yuan, Tongbing fell by 1,900, Tongding fell by 1,400, and Tongwu fell by 1,300, with a turnover of about 6 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks rebounded after yesterday's weakness, and people's hearts turned around when they saw low prices. Yisha opened at 76,000 yuan yesterday morning, and the closing price rose from 75,000 yuan to 79,000 yuan. Although the Jinhao, Yeguangbang, and Zhengquanbang sold, the foreign banks and retail investors all bought. People generally have a different view of foreign stocks. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the prices of telephone and shipping stocks were still flat, and the remaining stocks generally fell slightly.</p>
<h3>The Licenses of Bachuan and Zhenghe Were Revoked; Limited to the Shanghai Branches Only</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the suspension of business of Bachuan and Zhenghe banks, the National Bank dispatched two auditors, Hong Dashi and Yu Qian, yesterday to supervise the liquidation of the two banks. It is reported that the principle of liquidation is to urge the two banks to return ordinary deposits as soon as possible to protect the rights and interests of depositors.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the revocation of licenses by the Ministry of Finance is limited to the Shanghai branches only. The Bachuan headquarters in Tongling and the Zhenghe headquarters in Guangzhou, as well as the two banks' branches in other places, will not be affected for the time being.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Zhenghe Bank is well prepared and will pay in six installments starting on the 15th of this month. Customer deposits will be paid off by October 30, with a payment time of two and a half months. The amount of the deposit paid is divided into six types: 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, and 50 million. Depositors with 1 million yuan can be paid first starting on the 15th. Then, various types of clothing above 5 million will be paid in installments, and finally depositors with 50 million yuan will be paid. Bachuan is still preparing, and it is said that a method will be announced within Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The US Dollar Bond Solicitation Meeting Held its Fourth Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The fourth meeting of the US Dollar Bond Solicitation Committee has been scheduled for 4:00 PM today at the Trust Department of the China Industrial Bank. At that time, the meeting will discuss how to strengthen the work of soliciting bond sales.</p>
<h3>The Woolen Industry Opposes Japanese Goods; China Trust Bureau Guarantees Not to Dump Goods</h3>
<p>Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, the government authorities have already made a decision in principle, that is, imports should be mainly raw materials, and imports of manufactured goods should be prohibited. It is reported that recently the first batch of Japanese wool, totaling 300,000 yards, has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and the China Trust Bureau is currently going through customs procedures for picking up the goods. The entire membership of the Shanghai Woolen Industry Association was shocked after hearing the news. It is said that the industry will convene a general meeting of all members within a few days to discuss countermeasures in order to oppose the import of Japanese manufactured goods.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Shanghai Woolen Textile Industry Association sent representatives to the Foreign Trade Department of the China Trust Bureau yesterday to inquire and negotiate about the China Trust Bureau's order of 300,000 yards of wool from Japan. Yang Jinsheng, the deputy manager in charge of Japanese goods at the department, received them. The representatives specially handed over a letter stating the difficulties of the woolen textile industry and suggested that the Japanese goods be shipped abroad for sales. Yang immediately stated that the Bureau intended to export the goods early in order to avoid competition with domestic goods, so he guaranteed that he would never destroy the national industry and hoped that all woolen textile colleagues could rest assured that he would give a public reply in the near future.</p>
<h3>Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan Came to Shanghai to Inspect the Work of the Circulating Audit Team</h3>
<p>The Situation of the Inspection Was Said to Be Quite Good</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan met with reporters from this newspaper yesterday. According to him, the main task of this trip to Shanghai was to inspect the work of the Fourth Joint Treasury Circulating Audit Team and the regular inspections of financial institutions conducted by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank auditing staff. He said that the main task of the Circulating Audit Team was to audit the loan situation of national banks and bureaus and the use of funds by various manufacturers after obtaining loans. The general situation of the audit can be said to be good. In the future, the work of the audit team will also be extended to the loan work of the National Bank Discount Committee. The situation of the regular inspections of financial institutions conducted by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank auditing staff was also said to be good. The recent suspension of business of the Shanghai Bachuan and Zhenghe branches was not related to the entire financial community because the scope of business of the two banks was limited and the Shanghai money market was quite loose recently. The Ministry of Finance has now decided to revoke the licenses of the Shanghai branches of the two banks.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked some questions, which were answered separately. The main points are as follows: (1) The issue of monetary system reform has been widely discussed in all circles since the visit of Special Envoy Wedemeyer. However, he said that monetary system reform is currently a secondary issue. The main thing is to gradually seek its realization from the entire economic plan. If the prior conditions such as the gradual balancing of financial revenue and expenditure and the rationalization of production are resolved first, then the issue of monetary system reform can be solved easily. (2) The Fourth Joint Treasury is discussing the detailed measures for order loans. However, the government has continuously held them in the past, such as this year's spring grain loans. Regarding the order loan case of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, a broad decision will be made at the Fourth Joint Treasury meeting this Thursday. In short, the government intends to handle order loans carefully and will only hold those that are closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. (3) Regarding the proposal to change the delivery deposit evidence money collected from Shanghai securities brokers to 30%, he said that he had not heard of it. He also said that the Ministry of Finance has not prepared to consider this.</p>
<p>[Another News] After arriving in Shanghai, Finance Vice Minister Xu personally presided over a meeting of the Fourth Joint Treasury Circulating Audit Team at 4:00 PM yesterday to give many instructions on the audit work of the team. After completing his official duties in Shanghai, Xu returned to Beijing by late train last night.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales Are Not Active</h3>
<p>The tea market has not been very active, because various domestic sales teas, at this time of hot summer, are still selling steadily to local and visiting merchants, but since buyers have been continuously purchasing, the current demand has gradually been met, so they have no intention of buying eagerly. As for export teas, the French merchant Yongxing Foreign Company and Morocco agreed last month to sell 900 tons of Zhenmei tea. It is said that the export merchants in the city who accepted the order are mostly fully equipped, and they are all waiting for the ship schedule, so they are all taking a wait-and-see attitude towards any color. Transactions have decreased sharply, but the attitude of those who hold goods is still firm, remaining stable in the quiet.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market continued to soar. The appetite of buyers for the British Great Britain and Old Knife brands was particularly strong, and the price was pulled up sharply. The Chinese merchant cigarettes, such as Beauty and Golden Mouse, also followed suit and went up. It is said that the tax increase is bound to be implemented. The inventory in this street is very scarce. Although there are returned goods from other ports arriving in Shanghai, the quantity is small, and the needs of all parties are pressing. The adjustment of bargaining chips is still not enough, and the market is soaring under the shroud of buying interest.</p>
<p>Yesterday, ten Great Britain cigarettes hit a new high of 104 million yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 103 million yuan, a sharp increase of 3.8 million yuan compared with Saturday. Old Knife cigarettes also rose by 1.3 million yuan to 7.9 million yuan. Wuhua Hademan rose by 35,000 yuan. The price of Chinese merchant carton cigarettes also increased by 5,600 to 1,500 yuan across the board, and the price of American carton cigarettes and canned cigarettes was flat.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Allocates Rayon</h3>
<p>Allocation Price Lowered by 300,000 Yuan Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau yesterday conducted its 34th allocation of rayon. Except for Dongyang Dafugui (東洋大富貴), which was priced at 22.4 million yuan, other brands like Tianqiao (天橋), Gaoshan (高山), Jin San Ma (金三馬), etc., were all priced at 22.3 million yuan, 300,000 yuan lower than the allocation price of the previous week.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson from the bureau, the bureau has the authority granted by the Executive Yuan to consider lowering allocation prices. (Note: The Executive Yuan had previously stipulated that the bureau should handle the consignment sale or bidding of government materials with prices that are, in principle, 20% lower than market prices.) If external requests to lower the allocation price exceed the bureau's handling authority, then instructions must be sought from the Executive Yuan before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Although the rayon allocation price has been reduced by 300,000 yuan, the silk weaving industry is still continuing its petitioning efforts. Therefore, various parties in the market yesterday remained in a wait-and-see attitude, and the market situation was extremely sluggish. The 120 Jin San Ma (金三馬) with luster fluctuated between 24.5 million yuan and 24.6 million yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, it was described as soft, with prices falling another 100,000 yuan compared to the morning, and transactions were exceptionally rare.</p>
<p>Factory-Woven Fabrics Listless</p>
<p>With supply exceeding demand, the market trend for factory-woven fabrics was sluggish. Although asking prices for various grades of high evenness fabrics remained unchanged from last weekend, buyer bids were very low, resulting in a lack of transactions. Yesterday, D-grade goods were quoted at 28.5 million yuan, with bids at 8 million yuan. E-grade goods were quoted at 8 million yuan for new silk and 7.5 million yuan for old goods, with bids only at 6 million yuan. Neither transaction went through. High-grade goods on a seven-day credit term were traded at 28 million yuan. Sales of high-grade dry-processed silk were slow. Ordinary goods on credit saw slightly more transactions, priced around 16 million yuan. The Central Trust Bureau sold Huian (徽安) small factory silk yesterday at a price of 19.085 million yuan. The market selling price is approximately around 20.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabric Sales Weak</p>
<p>Due to sluggish actual sales of silk fabrics, and the anticipation of upcoming sales by factories, the market was exceptionally weak yesterday. At the opening, Dacheng (大誠) goods were offered at 1,040,000 yuan, and Huaqiang (華強) goods at 300,000 yuan. It once reached 330,000 yuan, but then declined. The final spot price was 267,000 yuan, and forward dating at 290,000-300,000 yuan. Dacheng (大誠) spot goods were at 367,000 yuan, and forward dating at 400,000 yuan. Although transactions of grid-patterned "bi zou" (格子璧縐) were rare, the floor price was quite firm, with transactions at 4,700 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Mixed, Some Firm and Some Weak; Soybean Oil Fluctuations Narrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 8,300 shih (石) of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. Market conditions were mixed, with some firm and some weak. New japonica rice was selling quickly, while medium and lower grades gradually fell by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. Early-season thin japonica rice and improved strains of early rice experienced fierce competition and price cuts. Due to the hot weather, old japonica rice was seldom accepted. White Yin Yuan (白陰元) seemed to be slightly firmer. Glutinous rice owners were very firm due to steady production prices, and prices increased by 10,000 yuan. As for Xinfu (新埠) indica rice, Liyang (溧陽) continued to have deliveries to Shanghai, and the trend was flat.</p>
<p>Flour showed slight variations. Factory flour was initially tight but then loosened, resulting in little fluctuation. Imported flour had a lively demand, surging by 10,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands also saw active demand, rising by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Factories were unwilling to sell wheat bran, and holders' sentiments remained unsettled, rebounding by 1,000 yuan. Taerun (台潤) soybean cake saw few sales, and the rural demand season had passed, gradually declining, dropping another 2,000-3,000 yuan, and Yingkou (營口) cake plummeted by 6,000-7,000 yuan. Various new supplies of miscellaneous grains were not weak.</p>
<p>Soybeans from Jiangxi (贛) and Hubei (鄂) arrived in rapid succession, and Zhejiang (浙) Eastern supplies were continuous. Market demand appeared light, and both new and old soybeans uniformly fell by 4,000-5,000 yuan. Broad beans had balanced arrivals and sales, with no price changes, but picked green beans saw active digestion and dryness, and most stir-fried goods saw slightly increased sales of 3,000-5,000 yuan. Continued imports of peas from Taiwan made the market appear firm.</p>
<p>Old soybean oil remained stagnant, its trend indefinite, with weak trading. New goods saw few buyers, dropping again by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Milled wheat had both low supply and demand, neither gaining nor losing. Red sorghum saw a decrease of 2,000-3,000 yuan, and corn experienced wild fluctuations, with newly arrived goods from Chongming (崇明). Public sentiment was soft, plummeting by 20,000 yuan. Raw kernels saw increasing price cuts, and sesame was hesitant.</p>
<p>The oil market in Guangdong (廣帮) remained unchanged, crude oil initially rose and then retreated, ending stable. Soybean oil saw no temporary gains or losses, and vegetable oil also saw little change. Clear oil was slightly soft, and sesame oil also saw no significant fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market showed a gradual trend towards stability as sales slowly increased. The association set prices, with No. 20 medium refined white sugar rebounding by over 10,000 yuan, to 563,000 yuan-560,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half refined white sugar in grass bags was at 725,000 yuan for spot goods, and 700,500 yuan for warehouse receipts. No. 24 coarse white sugar was at 710,000 yuan, and Taiwanese red sugar at 580,000 yuan. Shantou (汕) refined greenish sugar was at 440,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan, and lower grade at 415,000 yuan, totaling over 200 bags. Allied Chemical white sugar in bags was at 615,000 yuan-610,000 yuan, and in baskets at 589,000 yuan. Xing 赤 (Xing Chi) good grade sugar was at 510,000 yuan-512,000 yuan, and lower grade at 412,000 yuan, totaling two hundred-odd items. Diao 靑 (Diao Qing) good grade sugar was at 350,000 yuan-355,000 yuan, and oily lower grade at 334,000 yuan, with over 200 bags traded.</p>
<p>Traditional Medicine Turns Firmer</p>
<p>Since entering summer, the market prices of traditional Chinese medicine have been languid and stagnant. With the arrival of this term of order, the market has slightly turned around. Various wholesale merchants have slightly increased their purchases, with Sichuan fritillary bulbs (川貝母), elephant fritillary bulbs (象貝), apricot kernels (杏仁), saposhnikovia root (防風), coptis root (黃蓮), magnolia bark (厚樸), and Yunnan goods (云化) seeing the most activity. Market prices have shifted from weak to firm. Recently, Songjiang (松江), Jiashan (嘉善), Jiaxing (嘉興), and Xiashi (硤石) along the Shanghai-Hangzhou (滬杭) Railway, and Huangqiao (黃橋) and Taixing (泰興) in northern Jiangsu (蘇北), have been more active. However, the purchasing power of various wholesale merchants is extremely weak. Purchases are mostly in small quantities, and entire boxes are almost never accepted.</p>
<p>Fir Timber Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>Production prices in Fuzhou (福州) are also trending downwards. If there are no other changes, there is little hope for improvement before the Mid-Autumn Festival (中秩節). Among foreign goods, Liuan (柳安) is still doing well in price because it has not yet arrived in port, but the number of transactions is limited.</p>
<h3>Enveloped in a "Profit-Taking" Atmosphere, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Plummet in a Straight Line, Most Yarn Prices Falling Within the Spinning Industry's Suggested Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market saw the Spinning Construction Company (紡建公司) routinely selling 20-count coarse yarn, with negotiated prices reduced to 9.5 million yuan. However, most yarn prices in the market have already fallen within the negotiated price range, and actual sales to merchants have been minimal. With a "profit-taking" atmosphere prevailing, the market trend plummeted in a straight line. Towards the end of the day, 20-count Double Horse yarn (雙馬紗) fell sharply by 700,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 9.3 million yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix (藍鳳) fell by 600,000 yuan, to 15.5 million yuan. Special Double Horse (特雙馬) was at 12.2 million yuan, also down by 300,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn uniformly decreased by 200,000 to 600,000-700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market further declined. Rumors circulated that a certain high-grade Shilin (士林) cloth from Hong Kong was being sold for only 400,000 yuan per bolt, Dilong (地龍) brand fine cloth at 340,000 yuan, and Yuan Bi Ji (元嗶嘰) and Zhigong Ni (直貢呢) at 320,000 yuan. Merchants in Shanghai reportedly already spoke of selling off goods, causing greater panic in the local market and a strong "profit-taking" atmosphere. Buyers were in a wait-and-see mode, and actual merchant demand was extremely low. Furthermore, outside speculators flocked to sell, causing prices to decline all the way.</p>
<p>In the end, 12-pound Longtou (籠頭) fine cloth plummeted by 20,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, to 389,000 yuan. Various grades of fine cloth such as Five Blessings Blue Chicken (五福藍鷄), Rainbow Ball (彩球), and Yang He (陽鶴) saw prices plummet wildly by 15,000-16,000 to 33,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, "bi ji", "fu zhou" (府周), blue cloth, and Shilin cloth uniformly decreased by 5,000-6,000 to 20,000-30,000 yuan. It was also heard that Longtou fine cloth outside the market was quoted at 386,000 yuan, and someone was willing to sell.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation: A Widow's Immorality, Selling Ancestral Property and Engaging in Illicit Affairs with Her Uncle, an Unresolvable Family Tragedy</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have three brothers, and we have already separated our households. I am the youngest and still live with my mother. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I joined the army. Not long after, my second brother passed away, leaving no sons but a daughter who is not yet an adult. My sister-in-law does not abide by womanly virtues, disregards the family, engages in illicit affairs with a relative (uncle), and steals and sells family property. Because we have been away for a long time, we have not inquired. Recently, she also sold three "jian" of ancestral land. My mother's advice has been ineffective, and she even claims that my mother has no right to interfere. If this continues, the family property will be sold off entirely. I ask: (1) Does a childless widow have the right to sell ancestral property? (2) If a childless widow sells all the ancestral property and then remarries, can the property rights be forcibly reclaimed? (3) Can the ancestral property that has already been sold be redeemed? (4) If the widow fabricates that the sale of the property is to repay debts owed by her husband before his death, or uses the excuse of being unable to support her daughter, how should it be handled? (5) In the future, if we want to worship our ancestors or adopt an heir for my second brother, how will we do so without any property? Respectfully submitted, Zheng Liang-kai.</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuang-lin] (1) A widow's right to inherit property is equal to that of her daughter. Except for being able to dispose of her own inherited share, she may not dispose of her daughter's unique property. If she abuses her rights towards her children, the closest relatives or a family meeting may correct her. If the correction is ineffective, a request may be made to the court to declare a suspension of all or part of her rights. (2) If the ancestral property is jointly owned, she has no right to dispose of it. If she disposes of it without authorization, the co-owners may sue the court to have her disposal declared invalid. (3) Since there is no right to dispose of jointly owned ancestral property, a request to restore joint ownership can be made. If the court rules in favor, it can be recovered at the original price. (4) It depends on whether there is concrete evidence. Otherwise, a detailed list of the estate should be submitted to the court within three months of the commencement of the inheritance, ordering the creditors to declare their creditor's rights within a certain period. The debts should be repaid proportionally according to the amounts owed to each creditor, with the estate being used for repayment separately.</p>
<h3>Rent Increases Again and Again</h3>
<p>Tenants Hope the Authorities Will Quickly Establish Regulations</p>
<p>Dear Editor: We received a notice from the landlord stating that starting June 1, the monthly rent would be 450,000 yuan, calculated at 180 times the original rent. This translates to 30,000 yuan. From December of last year, the landlord suddenly increased it to 150,000 yuan due to high prices, which was already more than 600 times the government-set reference price. Helplessly, we paid it in consideration of mutual understanding. However, if we increase the amount again, it will be more than 2,500 times the regulations set by the previous government. In this alarming situation, we can only hope that the authorities will quickly find a way to assess a rent index so that tenants can follow the rules and avoid disputes and complaints. A Tenant in Shanghai, respectfully.</p>

<p>The World</p>
<h3>Statement</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying (謝冰瑩)</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Mr. Tang Guohua of the Northern Daily (北方日報) came to visit. As soon as he saw me, he told me that he had recently finished reading a novel I had written. I asked him what the name was, and he said, "Tenderness (溫柔)."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>I was very surprised and suspected that my ears had misheard, or that he had misspoken. I repeated the question:</p>
<p>"What is the title of the book?"</p>
<p>'"Ten-der-ness," Mr. Tang said louder, afraid that I still didn't understand. He explained further, "温 is the 温 in temperature, 柔 is the 柔 in softness."</p>
<p>"No! No! How could someone as rigid as me write an article on "Tenderness"? You must be mistaken. Please find this book and show it to me as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"After I finished reading it, I lent it to a friend, but I can write a letter asking him to send it back."</p>
<p>Next, we discussed several writing-related issues, but I kept thinking about that book "Tenderness" in my heart, wondering who would be willing to bury their own "literary reputation" to "support" my work. Perhaps the guest saw my unease, and he left without a long conversation. Half an hour later, Mr. Tang suddenly returned with a book called "Tenderness" in his hand, and he told me, "This was bought at a bookstall in Xidan Shopping Mall. There were many last year, but now there are only a few copies left. Maybe it's because you're living in Beiping, so they don't dare to sell it publicly?"</p>
<p>After saying that, he was dripping with sweat and rode off on his bicycle in a hurry. I wanted to pay him for the book, but he refused.</p>
<p>Looking at the title of the book and the ugly and unsightly faces of the women drawn, I knew that the content must be depicting eroticism. Upon opening the table of contents, the first article was indeed "First Taste of Tenderness from the Opposite Sex," which described a middle school student flirting with a waitress and fighting over jealousy; the second article, "Moon," was even more boring, actually flirting with female students. Most heartbreakingly, there were several places that mentioned studying in Beiping as "studying abroad," which made me doubt the nationality of the author of this book. In addition, the entire text was in "Kyowa language," which made you feel both hateful and pitiful at first sight!</p>
<p>At this moment, I received a letter from Taiyuan. I recognized the handwriting as belonging to Miss Tao. The last paragraph of the letter read:</p>
<p>"The day before yesterday, I borrowed a book called "Tenderness" from Mrs. Wang. When I saw that it was your work, I read it twice in a row. Unfortunately, there is no publication location or date."</p>
<p>The sentence "Unfortunately, there is no publication location or date," clearly indicated that she also had doubts. "Read it twice in a row," if that's true, she's been fooled too much!</p>
<p>Every writer has their own style. If you are used to her work, even if she changes several pen names, you will still know whose work it is. Just like Ms. Bing Xin (冰心) published a book called "About Women" under the pen name "Mr.," everyone knew that it was written by her because her style did not change even though her name had changed. I am naturally honest and unyielding. I am afraid I will never be able to learn or write this kind of "tender" article in this life. Now, the so-called "Shanghai Huazhong Publishing House" actually wants me to "steal" the "beauty" of others, which is really unbearable in my heart and unreasonable. I have to declare it.</p>
<p>The content of "Tenderness" is really impossible to criticize from a literary point of view. The stories written, except for the first one that took place in Hangzhou, all took place in Beiping. The cover of this book is printed with "Published by Shanghai Huazhong Publishing House in 1946," but there is no name of the publisher, no address of the publishing house, and no preface. This is very obvious, it is a trick played by boring traitorous literati; especially suspicious is that the articles all wrote that they were written in Shanghai in 1929. According to 1929, it was the 18th year of the Republic of China, and Beiping did not fall until the 26th year. What the book writes about is after the fall, which is really irrelevant. 1946 was last year, 18 years ago, so the works written should be a huge book that caused a sensation in the world, so how could it be so boring to only write about men playing with women, women playing with men's vulgar words, and judging from the content of the words, there was already a "Puppet Manchuria" 18 years ago, which is too much fun to take readers!</p>
<p>Enough! Enough! There is no need to cite any more examples. It is unforgivable for such boring literati to write this kind of despicable and obscene article to poison young people! And publishing it by impersonating someone else's name is extremely boring, and they deserve to die!</p>
<p>Friends who know about this incident and saw the news in the newspaper are very angry. They voluntarily offered to investigate the address of the "Huazhong Publishing House" for me and insisted on punishing the fake "Xie Bingying" according to law. But I think that since I have not applied for a patent for these three words, why be so serious? But in order not to "steal" the "beauty" of others, I have to make a serious statement.</p>
<p>(Written in Beiping on July 26, 36th year of the Republic of China. Author's note: This article is welcome to be reprinted.)</p>
<h3>The Call of the Sea</h3>
<p>— Tang Kuangying (湯匡瀛)</p>
<p>The sky is blue, the stars are blue, and the sea is blue. The time is the same as tonight: midsummer night. Your light and delicate hem rustles over the pebbles on the beach, making a musical and graceful tune, quietly like a melancholy nun. Your white dress sweeps past the low bamboo fences by the sea, letting the moonlight cast the beautiful shadows of the wildflowers on your hem. You walk on without paying attention, not even turning your head to look at the shadows of those wildflowers lying in the dirt, having lost their love.</p>
<p>"It would be even more interesting with a bit of flute music!"</p>
<p>You slumped down on a rock by the roadside, your eyes constantly looking at the sea, looking at the sky, looking at the twinkling stars. You love blue, but that night you weren't necessarily dreaming of blue in your heart; perhaps you were thinking about the distant journey tomorrow. These stars, sea, and sky tonight, when you recall them with a lonely traveler's heart tomorrow, will all be materials for a melancholy poem, which is why you felt melancholy.</p>
<p>In fact, in the thousands of years of human history, there is no place without the moon, no place without stars, no place without the sky, and no place without the sea. God does not need human tears and sighs to nurture this world, but the world is misusing tears, snot, and sighs to bury the light of the world. For example, tonight? Many soldiers are enjoying the cool breeze by the sea, and everyone has a world in their heart: when children frantically want to cross to the bottom of the sea to scoop up the moon to play with, adults' minds are filled with the tragic stories of shipwrecks in stormy seas; young men and women see the stars as the best symbols of loving couples, while older people worry about the sad separation of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl. Just take this poignant flute song, how can you be sure that the person playing it is burying himself in an enclosure of melancholy?</p>
<p>However, as you said that night, "We are human beings, and human beings only have human reason and strength!"</p>
<p>Many people have gone far away from the green trees by the sea, never to see the old returning boats, and many people have hoarsely called out to the sea for their lost youth, and I don't know how many people cherish the laughter and tears around them, turning them into a blur. But the seaside, the pebbles on the beach and the wildflowers on the bamboo fence know these things best, but have they ever told humans anything?</p>
<p>You said, "Throughout the ages, the sea has been the biggest demon cave for burying human sorrow."</p>
<p>"If human tears were as plentiful as seawater, wouldn't the tears of the world be worthless even compared to water?"</p>
<p>Because of my reply, you were even more inspired to say, "Therefore, people sometimes seem so small, but sometimes they seem very great."</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I have been like a broken boat that has lost its mast. In the midst of violent storms, I always quietly anchor between bamboo fences and thatched huts, letting those nimble sailors use all their strength to sail past me, and letting them cast a hundred contemptuous glances at me, and I am determined not to return a single one. I am only like a homing pigeon, hiding under the eaves of the house, tidying up my feathers that have been drenched by the rain. I do not want to throw myself into the vast sea to become a low-energy hero with broken limbs. It is not that the sea and sky are not great enough, and expeditions are not grand plans, but I feel that sometimes a person who is desperately chasing after the times with sweat pouring down his face is not as lucky as a bystander.</p>
<p>At the moment you left the seaside, I also quietly hung my hat like a traveling monk in this small city three or four hundred miles away from the sea, counting the footsteps of lonely people on the streets late at night. I suddenly felt as if my whole body was covered with the breath of mud. I couldn't help but wonder: "When did I become a prisoner of the small city?" Listening to the night watchman's chime every night, I remembered the sound of the sea waves, and the blue stars, the blue sea, and your blue eyes filled with melancholy. So I opened the small window and looked into the distance, and I said: I want to call out to the sea, and let the broken voyage filled with tears sail from the place I am familiar with.</p>
<h3>Summer Insects</h3>
<p>— Zhai Fang (翟放)</p>
<p>Cicada</p>
<p>At noon, the fiery sun, without any hypocrisy, shines down on the earth, shines on the stream, and shines on the cicadas on the banyan tree.</p>
<p>A string of white clouds in the sky, a string of cicada cries on the tree.</p>
<p>The cicada stretched its wings and cried.</p>
<p>The sound was like a broken flute, like a piece of red-hot iron thrown into water:</p>
<p>Therefore, I hate cicadas. Even more, I hate the sound of cicadas.</p>
<p>In spring, the chirping of hundreds of birds is a beautiful poem. In autumn, the bright cries of geese moisten people's complicated emotions. In winter, the eagles soar high in the cold sky, and people know that spring is not far away...</p>
<p>Only in summer, the cicada's cry subjugates all other sounds. Noisy, annoying...</p>
<p>When the leaves of the phoenix tree fall, the cicada slips away without a trace.</p>
<p>Bat</p>
<p>A streak of red is smeared on the horizon, and the birds returning to the forest are rushing...</p>
<p>Under the eaves of the house, one, two, three... black bats dart out, weaving, somersaulting, and gliding...</p>
<p>In this way, the poetic twilight of dusk is taken away by it.</p>
<p>Therefore: I feel confused.</p>
<p>The curtain of night is gently lowered.</p>
<p>Therefore: I hate the cunning of bats.</p>
<p>Frog Sound</p>
<p>Sholokhov said, "Loneliness is silent music, slowly playing elegies for people..."</p>
<p>But: bats are flying in the sky, and the sounds of frogs on the banks and at the base of the walls rise and fall in response, croaking...</p>
<p>I will light a cigarette and imagine without feeling lonely.</p>
<p>I will also take advantage of this not-lonely summer night with a not-lonely mood and rich emotions to write a page of poetry, which I will staple in my beloved collection of poems. Keep it for reciting on lonely nights without the sound of frogs...</p>
<p>With the sound of frogs, I will never feel lonely.</p>
<p>Firefly</p>
<p>Blue sky, green plains.</p>
<p>Summer night, stars in the sky: fireflies on the ground.</p>
<p>A dreamlike golden childhood is appearing. Like a poem, also like a corner of a tear-stained garment.</p>
<p>In childhood, on summer nights, sitting on my mother's lap, listening to stories about fireflies and fire:</p>
<p>"On the night of the Double Seventh Festival, the Milky Way in the sky is wide and bright, and the fireflies on the ground weave into a string of pearl lights, which is the light that the Cowherd uses to walk to the Milky Way to meet the Weaver Girl..."</p>
<p>This is a love story, and it is also the last story of my losing my mother's love.</p>
<p>A pile of yellow earth, a patch of green grass buried my mother, buried these stories...</p>
<p>Childhood is like a small poem, like a corner of a tear-stained garment. Ah!</p>
<p>The firefly brings my sorrow and remembrance.</p>
<h3>Lily</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Every year in the summer, vendors carry loads of lilies on shoulder poles, calling out in the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>According to the "Compendium of Materia Medica": The lily is also known as 　, Qiangzhai, Suannao 　, Chongxiang, Zhongfenghua, Chongmai, and Zhongting. It has a sweet taste, moistens the lungs, calms the heart, benefits qi, regulates the middle, stops nasal discharge, promotes diuresis and defecation, treats edema, abdominal distension, chills, fever, sores, breast carbuncles, and various typhoid diseases. The white flowers are used in medicine.</p>
<p>The "Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang" records: At the end of the Yuanhe era, Xiahou Yi's courtyard in Hailing grew lilies that were several times larger than usual. He was surprised and dug beneath them, finding thirteen layers of brick boxes. Each box contained one, and the seventh box was untarnished, reflecting sunlight in a halo of one zhang.</p>
<p>"Old Scholar's Notes": During the Meng regime in Shu, ten lily plants suddenly grew among the flowers, with hundreds of blossoms all paired on one stem. Their image was painted on the eastern wall of the gate tower of the Shengtao Temple, called the Auspicious Picture.</p>
<p>Lu Fangweng built a small mound of earth in front of his window to grow orchids and jade hairpins. Finally, he obtained fragrant lilies and planted them together, playfully composing a quatrain: "Moving fragrant orchids all over the middle forest, why not plant jade hairpins after clearing the land? And ask for two clumps of fragrant lilies, the old man at seventy still has a child's heart."</p>
<p>Lilies are planted during the Autumn Equinox. Take the petals and divide them for planting, one clump every five inches. Chicken manure is suitable, and frequent watering will cause the flowers to bloom luxuriantly, filling the courtyard with a pure fragrance. They should not be transplanted during the Spring Equinox, and divided every two years to avoid dying. Ming Dynasty poet Chen Chun wrote: "The fragrance fills the room late at night, one suspects it is when one wakes from wine."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 370</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This saying seems a bit exaggerated, but if you find any northeastern compatriots from that time and ask them, they might say it's even more "exaggerated" than that. The inhumanity and irrationality of the performances back then were even more "exaggerated" than that.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other things, just based on one unreasonable reason, this hostel could not escape suspicion: "Why did these two 'anti-Japanese elements' come to your hostel instead of going to another one?" The same reason could be asked of unrelated travelers: "There are so many hostels here, why did you have to stay in this 'anti-Japanese' hostel?"</p>
<p>Moreover, there's another point: Back then, whether entering or leaving Guandong, the "travel permit" had to be guaranteed multiple times and go through many troublesome procedures before it was issued. Along the way, at the numerous checkpoints, almost every major and minor station had records of this "travel permit." Given such strict control, once something happened, even if the perpetrator escaped, wouldn't those implicated be in trouble?</p>
<p>Of course, Yaoqun and Little Tiger's certificate was issued by the military, but if it were to be traced, it would be easy to uncover the truth. Therefore, although that withered old fellow looked repulsive and hateful, he couldn't be touched. He could only suppress his temper, answering every question truthfully, and every answer had to be based on something solid.</p>
<p>Just after that old fellow asked this question, before Yaoqun could answer, Little Tiger muttered: "Is this old thing even Chinese?" At that moment, the attendant behind them stepped forward and, with a burst of energy from his core, raised his voice and said:</p>
<p>"I say, Second Master Dong, these two are relatives of our old boss. They just got off the train and are only stopping here for a rest, not staying overnight... Besides..."</p>
<p>The attendant paused, turned to look at us, and lowered his voice: "This guy has ear problems... Quick!... Do you have proof of identity?... You must... Give it to me quickly..."</p>
<p>These two small but prominent actions fully demonstrated the content of the situation and the attendant's intentions. Yaoqun, being so alert, immediately took out the "permit" issued by the military and handed it over.</p>
<p>"Hey..." The attendant's eyes lit up as soon as he saw this special document, emitting a strange light. His large, round face, which was originally wooden and expressionless, suddenly relaxed, and he wore a strange smile:</p>
<p>"I say, Second Master Dong..." He raised his voice even higher, and suddenly presented the special document to the withered old fellow. ", Their background is really impressive... Do you recognize Japanese characters?... You don't!... I knew you wouldn't!... Look at this seal... Look at this official seal... 'Great Japan...' 'Permit...' This is... our writing... Absolutely certain... That's right, is this the photo, but are these two the people themselves?... Of course, there is no mistake, isn't it?... I say, Second Master Dong:..." (368)</p>

<h3>Where Do University Candidates Go?</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Universities across the country and in this city are holding entrance examinations these days. The number of candidates applying to universities this time is particularly high. One national university has already received over seven thousand applications, and the congestion at other schools can be imagined.</p>
<p>But what is the quota for each school? The university mentioned above, although it has seven thousand applicants, only accepts four hundred. That's a ratio of just over fifty out of a thousand. Where are the remaining six thousand six hundred to go?</p>
<p>We don't have statistics to check the total number of students coming to Shanghai to apply to universities, but just looking at the number of applicants to one university can give us an idea of the total number of candidates in Shanghai, which must be shockingly high.</p>
<p>So, where should these unaccepted university candidates go in the future?</p>
<p>It is said that the majority of the candidates this time are from Shandong and Henan, where their hometowns are in the midst of war. Their families' finances must not easily afford their tuition. They came to apply to universities, of course, hoping to be "publicly funded students," but the quotas of each school are limited. The large number of unaccepted young people definitely have no intention of returning to their hometowns. Most of them want to stay in the Beijing-Shanghai area, hoping to find an opportunity to work, either part-time or by thinking of other solutions.</p>
<p>However, under the impact of the depression, what method can Shanghai use to "entertain" these young students who have traveled from afar?</p>

<h3>The Closure of "Agence France-Presse"</h3>
<p>— Aifubi</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Agence France-Presse's Shanghai bureau has stopped publishing news externally since August. We cannot help but express our sadness at the cessation of news by a foreign news agency that has had a long-standing relationship with the Chinese press. We have specially invited Mr. Aifubi to describe the internal reasons for the bureau's closure, as a kind of farewell "address"!</p>
<p>On the morning of July 31, 1947, Mr. Ganshibo, the director of Agence France-Presse's Shanghai bureau, announced in a very sad tone that the agency would stop publishing its Chinese and English drafts from August 1. From August 2, all Chinese and English newspapers in Shanghai no longer carried news reported by Agence France-Presse. The general public all expressed their regret at Agence France-Presse's quiet departure from Shanghai. From then on, the reporting of international news in Shanghai would be monopolized by American news agencies. Therefore, the cessation of news by Agence France-Presse is a great loss to readers who care about international news.</p>
<p>The reason for Agence France-Presse's closure is actually very simple. Post-war France has superficially restored its pre-war international status; but in reality, it was devastated by Germany during the war, its vitality was almost exhausted, and it could not recover for a while. Especially in terms of economics, although the United States has lent France a huge amount of money to engage in reconstruction work, all the loans are about to be used up now; the Ramadier cabinet is currently worried about the "dollar panic." Therefore, special attention has to be paid to all undertakings that require the use of US dollars. In order to save US dollars, the French government stopped subsidizing Agence France-Presse and demanded that it be economically independent, self-sufficient, and no longer rely on the government to subsidize it with US dollars. Under these circumstances, Agence France-Presse's Paris headquarters had to be reorganized. After the new president took office, he examined the income and expenditure of each branch and found that the income and expenditure of the Chinese branch were not balanced, and the expenditure far exceeded the income. Therefore, he sent Mr. Tan Shigu to the Far East to investigate the actual situation. From that time on, Agence France-Presse was affected by the dollar panic and was already in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>Tan Shigu arrived in Shanghai and went to Tokyo (twice), discovering a miracle: the Tokyo branch was still able to be self-sufficient; but the Shanghai branch had to rely on subsidies from the headquarters. Therefore, he decided to increase the fees paid to newspapers for articles from July. However, the press in Shanghai was also experiencing economic difficulties, and everyone held the attitude of "saving every penny possible." Tan Shigu discussed with Ganshibo and consulted with Chu Yukun, the head of the Chinese department. The three of them visited Mr. Li Zikuan of Ta Kung Pao together on a very hot afternoon. In addition to bidding farewell to the Chinese press, they also explained their intentions; from Mr. Li's conversation, an unfavorable impression immediately arose, making him believe that it was impossible for Agence France-Presse to be self-sufficient in Shanghai. The taciturn Ganshibo said with great emotion: "The situation of Agence France-Presse is as depressing as the weather today!" But Tan Shigu was still not disappointed and mustered great courage to visit Mr. Chen Xunjing of Shen Bao. Mr. Chen's attitude was completely different, not only expressing sympathy, but also agreeing to the request to increase fees. When Mr. Tan left the Shen Bao, he was beaming with joy, and a glimmer of hope arose in his heart.</p>
<p>After Tan, Gan, and Chu returned to the branch, they jointly drafted a letter requesting an increase in fees, demanding equal treatment for all newspapers. As a result, it was rejected by the Shanghai Press Association.</p>
<p>Tan Shigu returned to Paris, and the headquarters, seeing that Shanghai could not be self-sufficient, decided to instruct the Shanghai branch to stop publishing news. Ganshibo immediately rushed to Shanghai after receiving this call in Nanjing, gathered all 30 employees, announced the dissolution, gave double severance pay, and expressed his gratitude to all employees. The life of Agence France-Presse's Shanghai branch came to an end.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Famous Works: "I Chose Freedom"</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>During the Great War, the United Nations, in order to eliminate the threat of Nazi forces, transcended "ideological conflicts," formed an alliance, fought side by side, strove for victory, and agreed to jointly create world peace after the war; but after the war, "ideological conflicts" revived and became the source of international divisions again. Not only can we not fully understand the actual situation in the Soviet Union, but also in the areas controlled by Soviet forces, because of the existence of the "Iron Curtain," it is impossible to explore the actual situation. This international division most easily leads to international misunderstandings, suspicions, and conflicts. During the Great War, knowledgeable people in the United States initiated an "International Freedom of Information Movement," wanting to maintain world peace through this; but the Soviet Union has not yet joined this movement; in other words, journalists from any country can go to any country to gather news, without any restrictions; the news gathered can be reported back without any form of censorship; after receiving the reporter's report, the newspaper can immediately publish it, without being affected by any forces. But today, reporters from various countries cannot freely go to the Soviet Union to gather news, let alone report news freely.</p>
<p>Although there are many books published about the Soviet Union, they are either promoting the Soviet Union or attacking it. There are very few detailed reports on the actual situation in the Soviet Union. Last year, Soviet writer Kravchenko published a book in the United States entitled "I Chose Freedom," which immediately swept the country and became the best-selling book in the American publishing industry last year. It arrived in China this spring and has also been valued by all sectors of our country. All parties have been looking for people to translate and publish it. As of today, three types have already been published: (1) The translated version by the Independent Publishing House; (2) The abbreviated version by the Tiandi Publishing House; (3) The abbreviated version by the Minzhi Publishing House. I have read all three of these different translated versions. But in the end, I feel that the translation by Qin Xuan of the Minzhi Publishing House is not only fluent and faithful, but also worthy of being called "truthful," "expressive," and "elegant." Personally, although I have more than ten years of experience in translation, I still feel that the structure of Chinese and English is different, and it is indeed not easy for translation to be complete in "truthfulness," "expressiveness," and "elegance." I know that after Mr. Qin Xuan translated it, it was carefully proofread by Mr. Cai Zhenghua, so I dare to solemnly recommend the translated version of Minzhi to readers.</p>
<p>As for why we want to introduce Kravchenko's work? Because the author, Kravchenko, is a standard Soviet worker, who was cultivated by the Soviet Communist Party and became the most famous engineer in the Soviet metallurgical factory; he not only has a scientific mind, but also has his own unique conscience and wisdom. Therefore, when he arrived in the United States, it was like being in another world. Everything in these two worlds is completely different; it made him feel that: although the Soviet Union is a socialist country, individuals have absolutely no freedom; although the United States is a capitalist country, everyone is free and equal. After his repeated consideration, he finally chose freedom, in addition to announcing his departure from the Soviet Union, he also asked the United States to obtain American citizenship. According to a recent report by the United Press, he will soon be able to obtain American citizenship.</p>
<p>He has no hatred for his motherland, but only feels that under the rule of the Communist Party, individuals have absolutely no freedom; he cannot but leave his motherland; the actual situation of the Soviet Union reported in the book is all true facts. In short, the Soviet Union is a country without freedom. "I would rather die than be unfree," this is the demand of everyone's conscience; the author's willingness to leave his motherland and choose freedom is worthy of everyone's admiration.</p>
<p>Announcement: Today's article "Ten Scenes of Travel in America" is suspended for one day due to excessive submissions. Hulu</p>
<h3>Missing the Good Time</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>United Press dispatch: The parish church of Paulston, England, recently stipulated penalties for brides who do not adhere to the time of the wedding. Those who are late by fifteen minutes will be fined five shillings; those who are late by more than twenty minutes will be held at the very end.</p>
<p>Strange to prescribe penalties for brides, missing the good time must be punished! Only strange why not punish the groom, what counts as a fair law?</p>
<p>Where is it difficult to go? The freest Republic of China, leisurely steps show dignity, ashamed to comply with the moment!</p>
<h3>The Death of Zhu Xinggong</h3>
<p>— Xiyi</p>
<p>——Introduction to Martyred Journalists II</p>
<p>The number of martyrs among Shanghai's news fighters not only exceeds the sum of all other places in the country, but also more than all cultural workers who died in the War of Resistance; this alone is sufficient to fully prove how Shanghai's press fought fiercely against the enemy and puppets with their flesh and blood, risking their lives. Among them, the one who fought the enemy and puppets most bravely, died most tragically, and possessed the most upright spirit, regardless of life and death, was undoubtedly Mr. Zhu Xinggong, editor of the supplement "Night Light" of the Damei Evening News. In addition, Mr. Xinggong was also the first person in Shanghai's press to be subjected to a planned assassination by the enemy and puppets.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's name was Songlu, and his pen name was Xinggong. He was from Lucheng, Danyang, Jiangsu Province. He began working at the Damei Evening News on February 1, 1938, and served as the editor of the supplement "Night Light." At that time, it was shortly after the withdrawal of the national army from Shanghai, and people were in a state of panic. Mr. Xinggong wielded his like a oak pen every day, promoting justice and supporting the War of Resistance, especially with regard to the general traitors, he made the general traitors object of his cold irony and sarcasm, incompatible with each other, thus winning the general sympathy of the broad masses of Shanghai citizens, and at the same time arousing the strong enemy resistance hidden in the hearts of the public. Mr. Xinggong's old writing style was very profound, and his pen often carried emotions. His daily short commentary or miscellaneous feelings almost became the daily necessary reading material for some readers after dinner under the lamp. In addition, he occasionally turned his spare time to engage in chanting or other kinds of writing games, entrusting remote depth, skilled craftsmanship, and aiming to support the War of Resistance and denounce traitors. When Wang Ni Zhaoming published a telegram and then fled from the War of Resistance camp, harming the motherland under the protection of the enemy, all Shanghai newspapers unanimously condemned him, and the articles written by Mr. Zhu were even more poignant and moving, which made him even more jealous of the traitors. In the summer of 1939, the puppet Secret Service Headquarters sent threatening letters for the first time, but Mr. Zhu remained unmoved and rebuked the traitors even more forcefully. In mid-June, Mr. Zhu had just recovered from a serious illness when he received a threatening letter from the Puppet Chinese Kuomintang Anti-Communist and National Salvation Secret Service Headquarters, stating that if any anti-Wang characters were found in the "Night Light" edition again, "personnel will be sent to execute him." Upon receiving the letter, Mr. Zhu immediately drafted an article titled "A Confession from Someone About to be Sentenced to 'Death' by 'National Law,'" which was published in the "Night Light" edition on June 20. In thousands of words, he expressed his firm position with the great and unyielding spirit, determined not to submit or beg for mercy, determined to seek benevolence and obtain benevolence, willing to sacrifice himself for the country and the nation, and rebuked Wang Ni even more severely, saying that he had gone from Qin Hui to Liu Yu, and that if there was still one person in China, he would die to oppose him. After this article was published, Mr. Zhu's bright and pure heart was even more seen by the people of the country, and the traitor's intention to kill Mr. Zhu was thus determined.</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Zhu lived at No. 94 North Henan Road in the Public Concession. That place was adjacent to Hongkou Zhabei, which was occupied by the enemy army, and it was not a safe area. The reason why Mr. Zhu lived there was mainly for economic reasons, in addition to taking it as a closer distance from the newspaper office. His monthly salary at the Damei Evening News was only one hundred yuan—it is said that a typhoid fever not long before his martyrdom had already left him heavily in debt—therefore, he had no choice but to live in that area, which was not safe but had relatively cheaper rent. On the afternoon of August 30, 1939, at 4 p.m., Mr. Zhu went out from his home as usual and walked to the museum to work. As soon as he walked to the vicinity of the Binjiang Building at North Henan Road and Tiantong Road, three thugs suddenly rushed forward from the roadside and blocked his way in front of and around Mr. Zhu. One of them took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired at Mr. Zhu's head. At that time, he was immediately shot and fell to the ground and died. When the police arrived and a ambulance was called by the police station to Renji Hospital, there was no way to treat him. As for the murderers, they had already fled in different directions when Mr. Zhu fell to the ground. On the afternoon of the day before Mr. Zhu's martyrdom, he had received a warning letter from the Puppet Chinese Kuomintang Youth Cultural Action Committee, threatening him and pointing out that he was unfavorable to the "peace movement." It was undoubtedly done by the pseudo-secret service of the Chinese traitor.</p>
