<p>抵美後將講解我國憲法</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨主席張君勵，定月中赴美，五日於晋京向蔣主席辭行返滬後接見記者謂，赴美係應華盛頓大學之邀，講解中國新憲法。渠稱：「美國人民極盼叫瞭我國向民主憲政行進之情况，吾人應即以各種客觀翔實之資料，供給彼等，藉以促進對我之瞭解。」記者詢渠是否有意訪晤美國政府當局，張氏謂：「如有需要，余自樂於與美國政府就一般問題交換意見。」關於行憲後之政制，渠表示，依照憲法規定，屆時政府組織將有鉅大變動。立法院之職　將大爲增強，同時行政院與立法院之關係將隨之益形密切。在責任內閣制之適當運用下，中國之政治無疑將進入一新的階段。張氏又謂新政府各部門之組織，目前大致均已擬妥，尙待解決者，則爲總統府之組織。撲之美法兩國，其總統府之組織均甚簡單，故我國總統府亦不宜作過於龐大之決定。張氏總分析三黨對立監委名單商談進展之情形，渠謂民靑兩當可各獲立委七十五名，此點國民黨已表同意。目前所商討者僅爲地區之配置問題。至於監委，已決定民靑兩黨在每一省區合佔一名，現民靑兩黨正就各省市應由何黨提名，交換意見。預料立監委名單之公布，即可實現。張氏幷謂國大不致延期，惟正式開會日期，需俟國代報到足法定人數後決定。</p>
<h3>美對外援助案</h3>
<p>共和黨一議員請求修正</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約五日廣播：華盛頓訊，美共和黨議員瓊克曼，今日吿衆院稱，渠將提出修正案，將對外緊急援助五億九千萬元削减二億九千億元，如此項修正案提出，則將成爲最大之削减。衆院撥款委員會主席共和黨議員寨勃，認爲五億九千萬元爲數過鉅，該委會將予削减。外交委員會卞席傑雜茨稱，緊急援助單獨不足以阻止共產主義，但此項法案如不通過，則今冬法義兩國將爲共產黨所掌握矣。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕衆院表決結果，五億九千萬之國外緊念救濟案辯論，以十二小時爲限，四日已獲其初步勝利。預料一般辯論五日夜將吿結束，在此以後，該案即將公開加以修正，至少有六位議員業已宣稱：渠等將提出修正案，負責將援華六千萬列入援外案內之共和黨衆議員周以德稱：中國如無美國援助，有完全受蘇聯控制可能。渠繼稱：如此事發生，蘇聯即能轉而征服世界。民主黨衆議員考克斯，亦力促通過該案，作爲美國爲其自身安全被迫從事之一項賭博。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕衆議院處理其對於中國，奧國，法國及義大利臨時援助法案問題，今日業近修正階段。代理國務卿洛維特吿參院撥款委會稱：假定獲得援助國家一旦置於共產黨控制之下，緊急援助必需停止。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約四日電〕紐約郵報今日載東京專電稱，某方已獲得秘密文件，藉悉日本當局準備利用未來對日和約，以消滅委師佔領政策所使日木實行之種種改革，並便日本現行民主機構支離破碎，至難以認識。此項秘密文件，係日本外交部所擬爲容暗示日本當局之野心，企圖阻止美國使其接受之種種改革，不致埀諸久遠，並擬保全其工業力量及收回已失各屬地</p>
<p>（聯合社東京五日電）日本方面對於未來和約已擬有數種秘密行動計劃。可　方面今日透露其一，據稱：日本擬發動一種要求最優待條件之運動。日本外交部現已擬就數種隨機應變之步驟。</p>
<h3>日首批賠償器材修理後防可應用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據目覩日本首批賠償物資之人士稱：「此批工業器材，本質不壞，但因盟總人員管理欠嚴。任其銹爛遺失，故將來運抵我國後，修理裝置費用，必然驚人，盼我公私各界預備利用此物資者，能有所準備。第二批物資以日本航空工業器材爲多，品質極佳，但何日能分配各國，尙　以估計。」</p>
<h3>日留華工業設備竟欲列爲賠償品</h3>
<p>盟總調查圖即來花</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：駐日盟軍總部，近爲調查日本賠償問題，即將委託一顧問專家性實之調查使節團，於本月十五日來華。該團一行十二人，由團長魏善（Wyeor）氏率領。聞調查團此行，使命有三：　調查日人原有在華財產數額。　中國獲得日本之賠償物資，有無吸收及利用之能力。</p>
<p>聞日人曾向盟軍總部解釋，日本可能列爲賠償之物資，國內國外各佔半數，故要求將日本原屬我國國內東北合灣及朝鮮等之工業設備，亦全部列入賠償物資之列。</p>
<p>關係方而昨爲此事，會向記者發表意見，認爲盟軍總部，果徇日木之請，則我國將來在對日和會中，勢將無法再分酣其餘賠償物資。實則日人此項建議，純屬荒謬。蓋：　日人對工業設備所打之折舊率，一般均在八年十年之間。留華工業設備，十九均已超過規定之折舊年限。　原有在華工業設備，例如沿海各省之紡織工業設備，現已極盡利用之能事。　日人留華工業設備，戰時破壞甚多，且多遭盟軍炸毀。現時之取備，大多爲我國自行修復已爲新添之設備。基於上述各點，日人建議將留華工業設備，移充賠償物資一點，理由當然不能成立云。</p>

<h3>歡迎新疆歌舞訪問團</h3>
<p>新疆歌舞訪問團一行，　於日前抵達上海。並定於今晚以箕歌舞技藝，首次與滬上人士相見。對於這一訪問團的蒞止，我們表示竭誠的歡迎。中國與新　之保有歷史關係者，自漢代以來，其間綿豆達爾千年。此兩千年來，中國內地與新疆時有接觸，然以交通梗阻，中國之內地與邊疆，迄未能達成文化交融之理想境界。我們對於新疆的認識，猶嫌未足；即邊疆之對於内地，亦不免輒有隔膜。為了民族的前途，這種彌可遺憾的現象，是應該及早予以消滅的。欲消除此種現象，其道雖不止一端，但莫要於增加彼此間的接觸，使相互間的了解能够增進。新疆歌舞訪問團的東來，就負有促進相互了解的使命。這是在這個意義下，我們歡迎新疆歌舞訪問團的東來。然而當我們看見這一歌舞訪問團從西北的邊疆，萬里東來，行抵上海，即將以其民族歌舞與上海人士相見的今天，除了表達我們衷誠的歡迎和祝頌他們旅居平安以外，願再申數言，期相共勉：第一，依照去歲國民大會所制定的憲法，中華民國為基於三民主義之民洽，民有，民享之民主共和國；三民主義，因之，實為吾國立國之基本準則。按三民主義之民族主義，有對外的與對內的兩面。在對外的一面，三民主義之民族主義在求中國民族之自由平等；在對內的一面，則在术構成中國民族之客宗族的自由平等。薪疆遠處邊疆，境内宗族不一，在新疆境內之各宗族，固應自由平等；即新疆境內與山中國境內之其它各宗族，亦應自由平等。中華民簇為一包有多種宗族的民族，各構成宗族在語言文化方面或未必畫同，但其同為中華民族構成份子則一。旣同為構成份子，就情同手足。我們今天歡迎新疆歌舞團的東來，就彷彿具有歡迎一個兄弟從遠處歸來那樣的心情。</p>
<p>第二，三民主義的民族政策是在扶殖邊地同胞的自我發展，而尤注意於他們固有文化的發育。中華民族的構成份子旣不單純，各搆成份子，又往往因其歷史地理的因素，凝成獨有的生活定型與文化特徵。三民主義中正和平的理想，便在維護邊地同胞固有文化生活的發育，中國國民黨於抗戰勝利後，召開二中全會會決議：「本黨之於邊疆同胞，向本扶助發展之旨，携手邁進，期共臻於富强康樂之境。」去歲七月，中央又秉旣定國策，對新疆省政府予以改組；所有省府委員十九人，分由漢。漢回，維吾爾，蒙旂，哈爾克，烏牧別克，柯爾吉斯各族人土充任。此後新疆局勢的發展，雖未能如預期；然以我政府所抱政策的開　，邃　　全國同胞，能共　中央的　　，加緊合作，內地邊疆，打成一片。</p>
<p>第三，就新疆一地而言，居民所　宗族雖不一，維吾爾族無疑地為新疆主要的宗族。關於此一宗族與中國的往還　在史乘，自唐代的回紇，歷元代的　吾兒，以迄近世，維吾爾文化所加於我漢族文化之影響，實至深且鉅。今日所謂的「國樂」，其中就具有不少維吾爾的成份。　舊胡琴之類，均是從西方來的，亦即是徑由新疆維吾爾族人手裏傳來的樂器當時與這樂器同時傳來的還有「西域」，亦即是新疆的樂</p>
<p>還有「西域」，亦即是新疆的樂　。現在藥調雖多巳失傳，而樂器却還依舊保有。今日新疆歌舞團的東來，重使我們回想到當年漢唐時代的盛况。願由於此一文化使節團的東來，能在我民族文化的發育上重新發生交互影響的作用，因而發出新的燦爛的光輝。</p>
<p>文化的交流，原是雙方的事。今日我們歡迎新疆歌舞團的東來，但願繼此歌舞團以後，新疆與內地的按觸，能够更趨頻繁。在歌舞訪問團以外，還能够有其它的考察訪問團相繼東來。在我們這一方面，亦應有各種團體的組織，前往新疆，以示答問。必這樣彼此的交往，纔能收增進相互了解，促進文化交流的實效。我們願由於此次新疆歌舞團東來所引起的對於邊疆的興趣，也能促成同樣訪問團的組織，前往新疆，使邊地人民益能增加他們對於内地的認識；達成相互交流的目的。</p>

<h3>四強外長將開始會商　德經濟統一問題　奧和約討論又陷於僵局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：馬歇爾國務　今日在外長會議中要求就德國基本問題加以討論，藉以結束德國目前之分裂狀態。渠謂，「余建議吾人應放　有關成立德國中央政府之一般性討論，而應就各國代表國之眞正意向加以坦白之說明。與會各國是否希望造成一種狀態，俾使德國在政治上與經濟上之統一成爲可能。吾人固希望臨時政府之　卑成立，但問題在於成立中央政府後是否能眞正解決目前之難題。吾人希望德國有眞正之政府，而不顧其僅爲一種自欺欺人之組織。」</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕外長會議今日討論奧國問題，由於莫洛托夫之拒絕發表關於蘇聯要求獲取奧境德資產之詳細聲明，馬歇爾乃建議暫時不談奧國問題，　行討論議程之下一事項，即德國宋來之經濟原則，後者將於明日開始討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕出席四國外長會議官員今日宣稱，美國務卿馬歇爾昨盟蘇聯外長黃洛托夫發生激烈口角，此在本屈會議尙屬初見，結果會議又陷僵局。先是，莫氏直接提及馬歇爾計劃，指摘美英利用援助措施企圖「奴化」奧國。馬氏聆言，甚爲憤慨，隨即宣稱，美國動機之被歪曲，屢有所聞，此等指摘實無根據。英外相貝文亦對莫濟托夫「奴化」一詞加以駁斥。馬歇爾，貝文及法外長皮杜爾並相繼質問莫氏蘇聯對於奧境德資產究欲要求若干。莫氏聆後答稱，「較吾人應得者尙少百分之十。」又間何者之百分之十？渠稱，「波茨坦會議所決定者。」馬氏則謂，美國無意拋棄波茨坦協定，但亦不允其被曲解，莫洛托夫蓋欲憑藉武力，强迫，及其他非法手段接收奧境德資產。最後，貝文要求莫洛托夫對於奧境資产捉出切實方案，以供外長會議賽查，但遭英氏拒絕。衆信馬氏即將建　撇銷目前德境之各國佔領區。</p>

<h3>比翼雙飛　半空裏結婚　飛機作禮堂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午十時，有一對新人在龍華機塲乘中央航空公司XTT39　號滬平綫客機在空中舉行婚禮，可以說是結婚儀式中別開生面的一頁。</p>
<p>新郎蔣仁山，浙江餘姚人，現年四十三歲，是前任行政院秘書長蔣夢麟的堂姪，江西路一二一號中泰紗號的經理。這一次結婚已是續弦了。新娘李淡如，江蘇丹徒人，現年二十六歲，以前是本市西門紅房子醫院附設協和護士學校畢業的護士。</p>
<p>XTT39各機飛行滬平綫，中途經過南京，本來應該在早晨六點多鐘就從龍華起飛，爲他們特地延遲了三小時，當天來不及從北平打來回了。這一架飛機並非他們的包機，他們也像普通旅客一樣的買票，另外請了十八位親友隨機同去，其中包括際婚人華茂行經理沈保年以及一位攝影師。</p>
<p>九點三刻的時候，一對新人就乘着汽車到了。新郞長袍馬褂，胸前佩綴一點鮮花。新娘白紗禮服，披了灰背大衣。兩人笑嘻嘻走進候機室時，吸引了許多人園渦來瞧然鬧。</p>
<p>中央航空公司的職員都顯得喜氣洋洋，上海站主任蔡之任指揮着替他們佈置，在機身中座位頂上紮了幾串柏枝鮮花，機門口也同样紥了，還在門旁貼一張红紙，用舉筆寫的「蔣李府喜莊」。活動梯踏脚下面地上舖了一方小小的紅氈，飛機芳邊另放一張舖有紅綢的方桌，桌上置兩籃淡紅的萬蘭花，此外導請人盡了一幅祝賀的紅綢，用美術字寫着「梵鳳和嗚」，預備請新郞新娘在上機時簽字。機中且特地裝了一架無綫電收音機。</p>
<p>十時正，播音機裏播送出「請新即新娘上機」的呼聲，接着又播出嬌禮進行曲來。一對新人就從候機室緩步走向機旁，在桌子的紅綢上簽了字，隨後站到活動梯上及機身門口攝影。空中小姐韋德廉嘻開嘴替他們權充嬪相，亦一起攝入鏡頭。接着在一片恭喜聲中，新郞通連拱手相謝。新娘則趕緊走進機艙，因爲她在這一段過程中已把大衣脫去，單薄的白紗禮服在十二月的室外冷空氣中想來是够她受的了。聽說昨夜她住在百樂門旅館，半夜三點鐘把紫羅蘭美容院的理髮師叫來做頭髮，到早晨七點鐘才做好的呢！</p>
<p>十時三十分，這一架「喜事機」腌空而去，他們將在空中舉行交換約指簽訂結婚證書等簡單儀式。中央航空公司的七位空中小姐還合送了一座蛋糕給他們在空中分贈貴客。</p>
<p>據新郞說，他們將在南京下機，以中央飯店爲臨時洞房，兩三天後返滬，還預備在百樂門設宴請客。這一次所以在飛機上結婚的原因，說是爲了「簡省」一些，佔計全部費川是三千于萬元。</p>
<p>中央航空公司的蔡主任在飛機飛出後笑着對記者說：「願意到飛機上來結婚的，我們非常歡迎！」準備結婚的情侶們，你們對這一種方式覺得如何呢？</p>

<p>我曾回讀去年十二月二十五日國民大會之中華民國憲法，覺得以上所指四項病根，其所注重者，僅及其半；換言之，即除對於人民之貧與愚二項，有比較正確之決策與條文之製定以外，對於病與弱二項，則皆語焉不詳，含混其詞，誠令人有尙欠週到之感。爰不揣冒昧，特行看重病弱二項，對於去年通過之中華民國憲法，略加補充，以就正於全國人民及政治專家，尙祈大雅不吝指敎。</p>
<p>中華民國憲法之緒論曰：「中華民國國民大會受全體國民之付託，依據孫中山先生創立中華民國之遺敎，爲鞏固國權，保障民權，奠定社會安寗，增進人民福利，制定本憲法，頭行全國，永矢咸遵。」我的意思，認爲在「增進人民福利」以下應加「確保民族健康」一句。因爲人民福利，固然亦可包括民族健康，但僅云增進人民福利，並不强調確保民族健康，即易使人忽略，而忘記了中國人民最大之病根在於多病與身體之孱弱，因而影響所及，引起人民死亡率之增高，平均壽命之縮短，於整個民族前途，損失至大且鉅；由此下去，更因死亡率之增高，因而影饗國民經濟之損失，又因平均壽命之縮短，因而影響許多社會事業及文化事業之建樹，使人民無永久奮鬥之精神。凡此所舉，皆爲各觀之事實，必然的推論，並不是故意危言聳聽之言詞。所以，確保民族健康，實爲建國最基本之原則，亦爲最基本國策之一種，我們在製定根本大法時，尤應特別注意。故我主張，在憲法之緒論中，應該加此一句。</p>
<p>第二章人民之權利與義務第十五條條文曰：「人民之生存權，工作權及財產權應卞保障。」吾意於「生存權」之下，應加「健康權」三字，因爲生存權一語，比較空泛。如說生存權已包括健康權在內，那末，工作權與財產權，又何一不可包括在生在　之中？今工作　與財產權，旣可於生存權以外，另立項目，則健康權一項，又何營不可再行添加，以示注意呢？</p>
<p>其次，第十章中央與地方權限，第一百零八條「左列事項，由中央立法並執行之，或交由省縣執行之」，應於十八項「公共衛生」，十九項「賑濟，撫卹及失業救濟」中間，加入十九「公醫制度」一項，而將原文十九改爲二十，以下類推。其一百零九條一左列事項，由省立法並執行之或交由縣執行之一下第一項「省敎育，衛生，實業及交通」，應於「衛生」二字下，加入「公醫」二字。第一百十條「左列事項，由縣立法並執行之」下第一項亦同。</p>
<p>第十三章基本國策，原分一，國防，二，外交，三，國民經濟，四，社會安全，五，敎育文化，及六，邊疆地區等六節，而關於民族健康一條，則隸屬於第四節社警安全之中，此亦爲不甚注重民族健康之表示。我意於第四節社會安全以下，應加第五節，即民族健康一節，而於原文第一百五十七條「國家爲增進民族健康，應普遍推行衛生保健事業及公醫制度」以外，另立一條，文曰「人民有疾病者，國家應予以適當治療機會。」以與第一百五十五條「人民之老弱殘　，無力生活，及受非常災害者，國家應子以適當之扶助與救濟」相對置。而且，只有加此一條，公醫制度四字，才有明確而充實之內容；而國家對於人民之疾病與健康，亦因有明確條文之訂定，才確認有此應負之責任。</p>
<p>以上爲我對於憲法條文之意見，特行提出，以備他日施行憲法及修改時之參考。或者有人說憲決第一百五十七條不已明明訂明「國家爲增進民族健康，應普遍推行衛生保健事業，及公醫制度」嗎？今所擬一切，原來就盡在此一條條文中，更何必多此一舉，老在條文上用功夫呢？我說不然。我以爲增進民族健康，及推行保健事業，公醫制度，只是一種政策，如果在人民之權利義務中沒有健康權之規定，則在法的基礎上，就失去根基，其基礎即不甚穩固。故我的意思，人民健康權之確立，實爲今後制憲不可或失的要點，此不僅在醫事政策——如保健事業及公醫制度之推行與否也。</p>
<p>或者又有人說，人民之健康，係人民個人之事，且疾病之來，半勝人爲半屬天然，而國家政治，亦從未有妨碍人民健康之法律，所謂　一健康權之確立，不亦有勉强拘牽之嫌否？我說不然。以前美國大總統羅斯福，曾提四大自由之口號，其一曰不虞匱乏之自由。夫不處匱乏，如果由個人主義之經濟學家說來，則個入之匱乏，完全繫於個人之動惰及儉約與否而定，於個家何關，更無所謂自由之權。如說此亦省自由之　，則世間之大，絕無一人能安於匱乏者也；更有何自由之可言？不知近代社會，個人之置之，實與社會制度有極大之關係，而國家之立法更不能步於此等處注意及之。由此言之，則羅斯福總統此一號召，實爲有遠見，且有深意存焉者。我今日主張在憲法中明確規定人民有健康之權一條，其用意亦即在此。良以今日科學進化。，社會雜複，非但大規模之醫學研究全國性的防疫工作，非出國家的力量，不能舉辦，即關於人民醫藥常識濯輸，以及普通醫療工作之設備，亦須由國家作整個之決策，再行分頭指導督促，方能底於完成。如果在憲法上確立人民有健康之權，則國家一切行政，隨時隨刻均應爲人民之健康設想，認爲確保人民之健康，爲國家行政最主要任務之一種，同時，又爲人民最基本權利一種，則理想政治與理想社會之實現，才能達到。昔日法儒提倡人權，謂人權天賦，一切都應自由平等，此語甚然。惟語焉不詳，於實施之時，尙有困難阻礙，無法達到理想。我總理中山先生，提創三民主義，於民權之外，再加民族，民生，良以民族壓迫不除，人民經濟不能平等，生活未能解決，即於基本人權，亦無法實現。我國素以貧弱著名，近雖對外擊敗强敵，然於國民之貧弱，尙未消除，則所謂基本民權，恐亦未能確立。何况我們對於救愚一點，已有敎育權之確立，對於救貧一點，已有財產權工作權之確立，而對於救病救弱兩點，又安得不有健康權之確立乎？</p>
<p>更有進者，近代國家之基本政策，一致的潮流，亦在求國家之富强。如果全國人民，均在貧病之中，試問此國家能富强，能達上現代化之道路否？我國過去之失敗，歷受列强帝國主義之壓迫，與東方病夫之惡諶法，實亦大有關係在焉。今日之謀國者，以及實施民主時代的人民，又何能不加極大之注意與警惕呢？</p>
<p>我平日是主張推行公醫制度的，但我近日覺到要推行公醫制度，要實施保健事業，却非從確立人民有健康權做起不可。因此，我提出人民健康權之確立的生張，希望全國人民及政治專家予以注意，更希望能在施憲行憲時能够被採納入憲法之中。</p>
<p>此外，我對憲法第一百六十七條「國家對於左列事業或個人，予以獎勵或補助」，「三，於學術及技術有發明者，」「四，從事敎育久於其職而成績優良者。」以下，擬添「五，從事醫藥事業久於其職而成續優良者」一條。因爲在公醫制度尙未實施，或尙未澈底實施之時，我們對於私人的努力，仍應予以提猖與獎勵。旣然如此，何以憲法上只注意於從事敎育事業及學術醫硏之成績，而忽略醫藥事業之努力與推行？但此己爲附帶一點意見。一幷附此，以供參　。</p>
<h3>旅行安全室</h3>
<p>— 諸民</p>
<p>本月八日，中央日報本市新聞欄內，載有京滬路前昨兩日，七十四次車，先後發生孕婦生產的事件。我讀後發生了幾個感想：一，火車中孕婦生產，急病，並沒有什麼希奇，雖則運上兩天，同一次列車，發生同樣的事情，是一件巧事·不是每天都有的；但是這稱事情的發生，照理，也是可以常有的！二，火車中不但有孕婦生產，比生產更危險的事也是可以隨時發生，如急性傳染病就是！道不但是發生急性病病人的個人生死，利害問題，更其是整個車廂中的傳染問題！三，這兩次的孕婦，都不能到達目的地，必須中途下車，據說大小均安。這是發新聞時的消息，現在是否健康呢？四，假定先有信件通知，而到時不見她們回去，恐怕家屬要着急了。所以，我爲了產婦的健康安全起見，建議給我們的交通部當局，對於鐵路，郵政，電報正在積極改良中，首先應增設旅安安全室，來解決念救和隔離的問題，這實在是一件急需的事！辦法，就是在列車的中部設置一安全室，有簡單而能减少震動的手術台，擔架，急救用具和藥品等，責由一位旣具助產識驗，又受過公共術生訓練的護士負責，在鐵路當局所費不多，但是在旅客方面，則得益無窮了！</p>
<h3>關於維他命（績完）</h3>
<p>— 尹集廷</p>
<p>一個值得起念的念頭是一九一三年。麥氏（McCollum）在一種脂肪中找到了促進發育不可缺少的維他命，於是維他命甲由此而問世了，維他命甲多含於脂肪　　質中，如奶油蛋黃之類，尤以　肝油中含量最多，人類的普通食物中，祇要不缺乏脂肪，很容易得到甲種維他命，用不着推崇價昂的魚肝油了，蔬菜中胡蘿卜萖菜，靑辣椒都含有這種維他命，缺乏維他命甲，發育便會受到阻滯，所以又各促進發育的維他命，還有一個特徵就是夜盲，一到晚上眼睛便糢糊不淸了，再重時可發生乾眼病及皮慮呈過度角化的現象，一九三五年美國生物學家外氏（Waid）更證明維他命甲與蛋白質形成眼球內視網膜上的紫色素，這稱紫色素是日光中視物的要素，這可知維他命甲與生命關係的重要了。</p>
<p>維他命乙是維他命中發現最早的，多含於穀類食物的芽苞內，如糙米，大麥小麥之類，花生米，肝和肉類含量最多，維他命乙的種類很多，缺乏第一種維他命乙（Thiamine）則得脚氣病，國內各地都有此病，米太細，麵太白，是原因之一，其次是吃肉太少，這種維他命有促進食慾的功效，用途確是很廣，發熱的病人，甲狀腺機能亢進的，醺酒的，以及勞力的人，需要較多的第一種維他命乙，第二種維他命乙（Niacin）是治療癲皮病的，除了這種病，其他可不必需要，</p>
<p>壞血病歐洲占時即有，戰地士兵，久航舟人，患者尤多，直至一九一二年郝氏（Holst）與胡氏（Frolich）以動物試騐，如知維他命的存在，以橋子　樣含量最鑒，蔬菜水果亦有不少，缺乏維他命丙，皮慮粘糢都容易出血，常有流血不止而危及生命的，這就是壞雪病，多吃靑菜是獲得維他命丙的簡便而良好的辦法。</p>
<p>鈣和燐是構成身體骨質的主要成份，維他命丁可以帮助身體鈣和燐質的吸收，兒童軟骨病就是兒童發育時期缺乏維他命丁的結果，軟骨病我國很多，且不限於貧家見童，維他命丁的來源與維他命甲相似，二者都是存在脂肪物質中，以鷄蛋黃魚肝油所含最多，人體直接經日光照射後，皮下組織有自製維他命丁的能力，以維持身體的需要，所以要時常多見日光。</p>
<p>近在絲色蔬菜及玉鐲黍小麥芽中發現了維他命戉，缺乏這種維他命風類不能生殖，人類多吃維他命戉，是否可增進生育，尙待證明。</p>
<p>維他命癸（ViamineKMenadione）之發現，在醫學上有重大之價値，對於初生兒的出血症及腸胃疾病的出血，具有遼效，無疑的：維他命的發現，對於疾病的預防，健康的增進，補益不少，實爲人類的福音，但是，維他命的用途是有一定的限量的，不問是否缺乏維他命，盲目的大量利用維他命，這不但是濫用，也實在是一種謂的浪費，現在社會中，維他命好像營養不良的唯一救星，和病人接觸的時候，他們都會這樣問：我是不是缺乏維他命？我該注射那種維他命？藥商們更利用人們崇拜維他命的心理，五花八門，巧立名目，冒名維他命的製品，稱補身聖藥，售諸於市，借肥私囊，因而濫耗的維他命，不知有多少？再看看我們的鄉村裏，脚氣病，軟骨病，夜盲症的發生，是多麼需要維他命救治，常因爲得不到維他命的補治，而致殘廢或危及生命的，不知凡幾？我國實非維他命的供給不足，而是浪費在少數人的身上過多，受益不均，多寡懸殊，實在是辜負了科學家們發明維他命的勞力，遠背了他們浩福人羣的本旨，這是他麼遺憾而急待醫界同仁改救的事實。</p>

<h3>英國足球的起源（上）</h3>
<p>[</p>
<p>— 樂秀榮</p>
<p>英國足球的起源，雖然有許多傳說，最爲可信的，現代英國足球是一種古代羅馬遊戲名爲Haroastum的流傳。這種古代羅馬遊戲，是選擇兩個實力相仿的隊伍，在每隊陣地的後面，劃一條錢，於是誰先把球帶入衝過對方這一條陣錢，就算勝了。這一種比賽，可能是由羅馬士兵傳到英國的。幾世紀之後，再由管理學校的僧侶介紹給學意。一一七五年，倫敦的學童，都玩足球，星期二特定爲足球日，全市的學童，在這一天都到郊外去玩這神聖的足球。倫敦三大敎堂附屬的學校，都備着自己的足球，公共政府機關則每年供給賽球，給一般兒童的娛樂。</p>
<p>在中世紀時代，足球賽受了個很大的打擊，當局制定好幾條法律，禁止玩足球，及其他相同的比賽。歷史家史德勃斯並抗議說：「足球比賽與其說是娛樂，實爲一種友誼式的鬥爭」？一到一六六六年，足球賽事實上已認爲是違背法律。雖然如此，並不能分離大衆對足球的普遍愛好。慢慢的發展到敎堂區與敎堂區間的比賽，城市和鄉間的比賽。在今日諾森堡與特倍夏的幾個村鎭裏，還有這種古代的遺風。</p>
<p>十八世紀的末葉，這種普遍性逐漸的消滅，直至一般公立學校把各種球類比賽，作爲體育娛樂，足球賽又見復活。一八六〇年，許多大的學校，都承認足球爲一種冬季的遊戲比賽。各校都自己規定比賽規則，於是大學裏也踢足球，各校的校友也組隊比賽。因爲各校的比賽規則不局，安排學校間的比賽，相當困難，於是劍橋大學足球會就開始把各種不同的規則集起來，草成一種包括各項要點的總則。同時，各地足球會風起雲湧，一種共同遵守的比賽規則，已顯然急迫的需要。一八六三年十月，主要各都市足球會的負責代表，和對足球有興趣的人，在倫敦大皇后街費禮曼遜飯店舉行會議，目的是在組織一個會，「來制定一種正式比賽的規則」。這個會大家很熱烈的參加，決定成立這歷史性的英國「足球會」。</p>

<h3>調整匯率與供應現鈔　國行須兼籌並顧　四聯將派員來滬交換意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國經委會四日決議，應由四聯總處，全綫籌　，减低內匯匯率，儘量做，並便利內匯，明關提高匯滬　匯率，並限制大款匯兌，同時由財部制定現鈔携運辦決，由國行供應內地現鈔，以資配合一案。記者昨曾往訪國行某關係當局，徽詢對此事之意見，據稱：國家行局庫內匯率，每週六均由各行局庫代表，召開小組會，就過去一週來匯率情形，酌定次一週之內匯率，並隨時視各地頭寸之流動　緊情形，而對匯有有彈性之伸　。渠認爲目前匯率之伸縮，純整於頭寸之供應問題。如頭寸充裕。　可大量供匯，匯率不抑自平。否則，徒然提高對某地之匯率，一方面對頭寸之移轉，固稍有限制。惟對某地之高匯率，勢將轉嫁於當地之物價，無形又提高谷地物價水準。故斃整匯率時，尤須注意於現鈔之携運，並須兼顧各種事實環境，統盤籌劃，方克有濟云。</p>

<h3>語言學與歷史</h3>
<p>— 季羡林</p>
<p>語言學同歷史學雖然都是獨立的科學，但有許多地方可以互相幫助。歷史學能幫助語言學，這是我們都知道的；因爲要硏究一種語言，第一步先要知道說這種語言的民族的歷史：這用不着我們再詳細去說。至於語言學能幫助歷史的研究，甚至有些歷史上的問題只有從語言上去解決，似乎還有特別提出來談一談的必要。我預備在下面舉兩個例證。</p>
<p>第一個例證我想舉印度歐羅巴民族原居地和以後遷移的情形的問題。這當然都是歷史的問題；但提出這問題而又把這問題解決了的却是語言學。要叙述這問題，我們應該先從比較語言學說起。十八世紀末葉，十九世紀初年歐洲學者纔開始接觸到梵文。不久他們就發現，梵文同希臘文，拉丁文相似的地方非常多。經過細密的研究，他們終於知道了，他們一向認爲是有色人種的印度人用的語言，原來同他們自己的古代語言竟是一系，皮膚黑色的印度人原來也同他們是一家。幾千年前分了家出走的一個兄弟，現在忽然又回來歸了宗。對白種的雅利安人這是多麼大的一件喜事。所以歐洲一位大學者說，Dyauspic（梵文）=Zcus-pater（希臘文）=Jupiter（拉丁文）這個公式的發現是十九世紀人類最博大的發現之一。他們旣然知道了梵文，希臘文，拉丁文和歐洲近代語言原來都是一個來源，於是他們就根據這綫索研究下去，終於把所謂原始印度歐羅巴語言　構出來。這種語言就是後來一切印度歐羅巴語言的祖先。在這語言裏有一各舌根音。這舌根音後來不知道爲了什麽原因分化起來。在印度語系的東支語言裏，他愛成摩察音；在西支語言裏，他變成了k　kh　g　gh。譬如說表示「狗」的字在希臘文裏是kuon，在拉丁文裏是Canis，這是西支。在反問裏是，Svan在立陶宛文裏是Szuo，這是東支。「百」字在拉丁文裏是Centum，在希臘文裏是Hekaton；在Avesta裹是Satem，在梵文裏是Sata，在立陶宛文裏是Szimtas，在古保加利亞文裏是Suto，在俄文裏是Sto。學著門平常就用Centum這個字來代表西支語言，用Satow來代表東支語言。這些語言雖然都是從原始印歐語裏演變成的，但却各有各的特點。間或也有兩種特別接近的，像古代彼斯的Avesta和梵文。以上這許多事實都是純粹由研究語言得來的。倘若把這研究語言得來的結果應用到歷史上，我們可以對印歐民族遷栘分化釣情形得一個淸晣的輪　：現在散佈在歐亞兩洲的白種人在紀元前幾千年的時候原來都是一家。他們定居在舊大陸的某一個地方，人口大概也不會太多。後來也許是因了宗敎意見的衝突，也許是因爲政治意見的衝突，終於分了家。一支往西走去，幾千年來，子孫蕃衍，形成了許多國家。一支往東北或東南走去。在向東南去的路商，他們停留在現在的伊朗地方，共同往了一個期間。大槪內部又起了衝突。於是一部分留在原地，一部分却越過高山，衝進了印度，成了現在印度雅利安人的祖先。看了我這簡短的叙述，誰也會知道這事實在世界歷史上有多麼大的意義；但在世界歷史上有這樣重大的意義的事實却不是歷史學吿訴我們的，而是語言學。</p>
<p>我上面說到原始印歐民於曾定居在舊大陸的某一個地方。倘若現在要問，究竟在什麼地方呢？這當然又是一個歷史上的重要問題。考古學，史前史，人類學都能帮忙解決這問題；但倘沒有語言學，其他科學都只能給我們一點零碎的知識。只有語言學能把這些零碎的知識貫通起來，給我們一個淸晣而具體的答案。所以我們仍然只有先從語言學下手。我們先看一看學者所稱擬成的原始印歐語言裏究竟有些什麼字，尤其是動物和植物的名詞。動物名詞有牛，馬，羊，狗，猪，熊等；但沒有虎，象，獅子，驢，駱駝。植物名詞有柳樹，樺樹，山毛櫸等。旣然沒有虎，象，獅子，可見原始印歐民族還沒見到這幾種動物；因而也就可以推論到，他們的原居地一定不會是熱帶，同時又因爲原始印歐語裏沒有表示「海」的字，足見他們住的地方也不近海。沒有「駱駝」，可見他們不是住在沙漢裏。但從這些字裹面，我們仍然不能確定的指出一個地方來。讓我們再看看植物名詞。在這些字裏面」最重要的是「山毛　」這個字；因爲據學者觀察和研究，倘若在歐洲北部從德國的大城KonigsbCrg起向南畫一條錢經過俄國的Kiew一直到黑海岸上的Odessa止，那麼只有在這條綫的西面纔有山毛櫸，東面沒有。所以原始印歐民族的老家一定是在這條錢的西面。把上面這些歸納起來，我們可以說，印歐民族的原居地大槪就在中歐至北歐一帶地方，而且還稍稍偏東。有了這語言學吿訴我們的知識作基礎，然後其他科學關於這方面的硏究纔有所依附，得到的結果纔不至茫無邊際。所以在硏究這個極重要的歷史的問題的時候，語言學爲主，其他如考古學，人類學都只能帮助語言學。原始印歐民族的原居地的問題是個極大的問題。我上面雖然說了許多，而且得到一個似乎梵結論的結果；但這問題並不像我上面說的那樣簡單，那結果也還不就是結論。將來的發展還有待於學者的努力。不過，將來無論硏究到什麼程度，那些由語言學觀察出來的結果却絕不會被推翻，學者們只能把這結果補充修正，使牠更接近眞理。</p>
<p>同這問題相連的還有一個問題，也是語言學提出來而現在還沒有解決的。我們上面說過印歐語系有東西兩支。在歐亞大陸西部的屬於西支，在歐亞大陸偏東部的屬於東支。這似乎非常自然，一點也沒有問題。在十九世紀比較語言學者所知道而加以研究的許多印歐語系的語言都合於這個區分，換句話說，就是牠們的文法現象和地理部位毫不衝突。但二十世紀初年學者們又在中亞發現了幾種新語言，上火羅文就是其中的一種。這些語言都毫無疑問的屢於印歐語系。按地理說，吐火羅文應該劇於東支，因爲吐火羅文淺卷都是在中國新疆發現的。但吐火羅文的文法却確實是屬於西支的。「百」字在吐火羅文裏是Kant這就足以說明吐火羅文是一個Centum語言，爲什麼在一羣印歐民族的東支的民族裏會有一個屬於西支的民族呢？目前我們還沒有方法解答這問題。但我們相信，倘若將來這問題一且解決了，我們對世界史，尤其是印歐民族遷移的歷史，一定有很深的了解。</p>
<p>另外一個問題也同印歐語言有點關聯，我們也在這裏提出來談一談。鋼和泰先生曾指出來，中國語言有幾個字似乎同印歐語言有點關係（見北京大學季刋第一卷第一期，　譯梵書與中國古音，胡適之先生譯）。譬如說，「犬」字似乎同希臘文的Kuon，拉丁文的Canis同源。倘若這種例子找多了，我們說不定就可以證明中文同印歐語系同出自一源，也許能把中國人同印歐民族拉成一家。我雖然不敢說，這一定可能；但也不敢說，一定不可能。我只能說，在目前還沒法證明。倘若認眞想解決這問題，我們只有效法歐洲學者的辦法，去硏究中國古音，把原始中國語言構擬出來，然後再同原始印歐語言去比較。這當然又是一個在歷史上非常重要的問題。在這裏，我們也只有先走一條路，就是語言學的路。</p>
<p>以上討論第一個例證。第二例證我想舉古代西域人種的問題。我們都知道，現在住在中亞和中國新疆一帶的是突厥種。但在突厥人到這裏以前是什麼人在這裹住呢？我們古代的歷史書雖然有一些對西域特別注意的，特別專寫一章論西城的事情；但從那些記載裏，我們很難窺測到這些所謂胡人都究竟屬於那個種族。對這些胡人的像貌，魏書西域傳干國國條算是給了一個比較具體的描寫：「自高昌以西，諸國人等，深目高鼻。唯此一國，貌不甚胡，頗類華夏。」但是只是「深目高鼻」四個字也只能吿訴我們，他們同「華夏」人不一樣。白種人固然是「深目高鼻」，突厥人又何嘗不這樣呢？我們仍然不能確定他們的種族。自從十九世紀末年二十世紀初年，中亞古器物文獻出土以後，我們研究的憑藉增加了。我們從壁畫上可以看到這些「胡」人的面貌；但給我們的印象仍然只是「深目高鼻」四個字。連從地裏掘出來的頭蓋骨也只能吿訴我們，在突　民族沒來到以前，中亞民族一定是屬於印歐民族的白人。我們仍然不能知道，究竟是白人的那一種。在這裏能帮助我們解答這問題的又只有語言學。</p>
<p>在中亞新發現的三種古代印歐語系的語言中，吐火羅文是獨立的一支。關於說這種話的民族的歸屬問題，學者們的意見還非常不一致，我們這裹不能詳細討論。其餘的兩種，干聞文和　利文都已經學者硏究認爲是屬於印歐語系伊蘭語系的。所以說這種話的人們大槪也就屬於伊蘭氏族。現在我們再回頭看我們上面提出的問題：在古代西域突厥人未到以前究竟住的是那一種人？我們就可以回答說：最少有一大部分是伊蘭民族。</p>
<p>以上討論第二個例證，可舉的例證當然還非常多；但只是這兩個也就足夠能表示出來，語言學是怎樣能幫助歷史的研究了。我上面說的有一些只是老生常談；但我爲什麼特別提出語言學同有許多科學都能作史學的輔助科學；但語言學似乎乎還沒被人持重視過。我特別提出來，只是想喚起大家的注意。此外我還覺得，有很多純粹的語言學者把研究的範圍死死的限制到語言方面，不向外走一步。這我也認爲很可惜。常然並不是每一個語言學研究的結論都可以應用到歷史上去；但最少有些是可以的，而且把語言學的結論結用到歷史上獲得的結果多半都非常可靠。爲了讓語言學家注意起見，我爲了這篇短文。（一九四七年十一月二十九日，北京大學）</p>

<p>石鼓是傳世金石裏最煊赫的一件古物，從隋發現以後，題訊，辯論，考釋，　刻，我所知道的，至少已有一千多事。單是它的時代，已是聚訟紛紜的一個題目。當初發見時，蘇勗作題記，大槪覺得它的文字有些像　文，就斷定它是史籀寫的，所以說：</p>
<p>「世咸言筆蹟存者，李斯最古，不知史籀之迹，近在關中。」</p>
<p>因爲史　據說是周宣王太史，石鼓文「　車旣工」的句法，又和三百篇裏號為宣王詩的車攻符合，所以唐時詩人像：韋匯物，韓愈等，書畫儀：李嗣眞徐浩等，都以爲是周王時做的。</p>
<p>歐陽修首光懷疑這一說，他說從共和元年到嘉祐八年，有一千九百十四年，鼓文細而刻淺，理豈得存。又說漢以來博古好奇之士，略而不道，隋世藏書最多，獨無石鼓。可是又說：『字畫非史　不能作，」這是因爲他不曉得石鼓就出在隋朝的緣故。董　廣川　跋，程大禺雍錄又都以爲是成王時作，他們的很據只是左傅昭公四年所說：「成有岐陽之蒐」的一點。</p>
<p>翟耆年　史說：</p>
<p>「篆　行筆當行於所當行，止於所當止，今位置窘澀，促長引短，務欲取稱，如柳帛君庶字是也。意已盡而筆尙行，如以可字是也。十鼓略相類，姑舉一隅。職者當自神悟。以器　惟字參鼓刻惟何惟鯉之惟，則曉然可見矣。　字畫無三代醇古之氣，吾是以云。……　於此書，直　非史　跡也。</p>
<p>翟氏用看　鼎的眼光來看石鼓，這議論是狠對的，但也沒有指出應當屬於什麼時代。</p>
<p>鄭樵才由文字來證明石鼓是秦篆，因銘中有『嗣王』，定爲惠文之後，始皇之前。　　大概不信閻王是秦王，所以定爲襄公後，獻公前。</p>
<p>但是從溫彥威傅來金人馬定國的意見，却以爲是後周文帝做的，這是因爲西魏文帝大統十一年有西狩歧陽的事。淸代學者大都用周宣王說，可也有人主張後周的。還有好奇的人，像武意說是漢時作的，王　運說是晋時作的，兪正變因李彪表有「禮田岐陽「的話。以爲是北魏太平眞君七年作，姚大榮因之說是崔浩作。</p>
<p>由文字的比較，近代學者大抵已經知道，它旣不會是西周，更絕對不會是漢以後，大家都相信是秦刻石了。可是時代先後，依然還有爭執。　樵的年代是錯的，鞏鹽的又拉得太長。震鈞羅振玉直定爲秦文公東獵時作。馬衡根據秦公　來推測，應在穆公時。郭沫若主張是襄公，馬叙倫還以爲是文公，兩人曾因此爭辯過。最近看到許莊所作石鼓文綴，也主張是秦文公。</p>
<p>除了鄭樵鞏豐外，近代學者所主張的是：　襄公，　文公，　穆公，時代都在春秋中葉以前，（穆公卒於西元前六二一）。我覺得遷都是錯的。</p>
<p>從文體來說，這十篇詩在三百篇裏毫無影響，「　車旣工」，顯然是抄襲詩經的「車攻」。從書法來說，這種方方正正的文字，規矩而局促，字又特別大，和一般的金文完全不同，更不能和秦公比。我應該同意翟耆年的說法，「無三代醇古之氣。從馬定國以下疑心它是漢以後的作品，主耍原因就是覺得它的不古，所以要把它放後些。這種直覺的說法，我們也應該考慮到的。</p>
<p>最重要的方法，是由它所用的文字來看它的時代，鄰樵旣由「殹」和「烝」兩字而知道這是秦刻石，馬衡又用十二種業文來證明它，這是類撲不破的了。但是，他們都沒有注意到它的時代性，鄭樵因爲「嗣王」兩字定爲惠文王以後，其實嗣王還是周天子，他的說法根本錯誤。近代各家定爲文公，襄公或穆公，却都完全沒有注意到下面這些文字上的間題。</p>
<p>秦公簋和秦公鐘　所用第一人稱代名詞，只有「朕」，和「余』，朕字用在領格，余字用在主格。</p>
<p>石鼓文有兩處用「余」，兩處用「我」字，十一處用「　」字，「　」字的用法，有主格，有領格，領格較多，沒有『朕」字。（下期續完）</p>
<h3>談「絕句」的一封信</h3>
<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>平伯兄：</p>
<p>謝謝你寄詩給我讀。</p>
<p>絕句最難作。但這個「小詩」體裁頗適於寫一個小題目，故我想這個方式在將來必定還有人繼續試用。但絕句本出於南方民歌，到了文人手裏，就往往陳腐化了。今後絕句若能保存，必須多多與民歌接近，一掃陳言套語，用最乾凈的話語表現一個新鮮的意用或印象，——這樣才可以有新的生命。</p>
<p>十多年前，廢名曾特別梅贊李義山這首絕句：</p>
<p>雲母屛風燭影深，長河漸落　是沉。常娥應悔偸並藥，碧海靑天夜夜心。</p>
<p>那天兪大　女士請我寫　十，也推荐這首小詩。我覺得這首詩不是頂好的絕句，有點小意思，說的不很淸楚。我請幾位朋友試把這首詩譯成英文看看，他們才說，開兩七個字就不好譯，因爲「燭影深」可以有許多種說法。至於末兩句，初讀似易解，細想才覺得很難翻譯成白話或外國文。</p>
<p>這樣的絕句巳是離開民歌很遠了</p>
<p>我所謂接近民歌的絕句，可舉一例：</p>
<p>楊柳靑靑江水平。聞郞江上唱歌聲。東邊日出西邊雨，道是無晴選有晴。</p>
<p>這是民歌，也許經過了劉夢得的小小修改，但民歌的風味究全存在。又舉一例：</p>
<p>遙知天上桂華孤，爲問常娥更要無。月宮幸有閑田地，何不中央種兩株？</p>
<p>香山此詩當然有寄託，但這種寫法，還很像民歌。我覺得道首絕句比養山那首高明的多了。（白香山自己也很喜歡這首詩，後來他有「聽唱桂華曲」的詩、可見此詩在當時頗流行，成爲歌曲。）</p>
<p>文人從民歌裏得了絕句體裁，加上新的見解，加上比較深刻的觀察，加上比較豐富的內容，所以詩人的絕句往往有新的境界，有民間歌唱不容易達到或不能達到的境界。老杜的漫興是最好的例子：</p>
<p>手種桃李非無主，野老牆低還是家。恰似春風相欺得，夜來吹折數枝花！</p>
<p>隔戶楊柳弱嫋嫋，恰似十五女兒腰。誰謂朝來不作意，狂風挽斷最長條！</p>
<p>這稱境界是民歌裏稀有或沒有的。但這裏的語言都還是最樸素，最乾凈的白話，不靠典故，不　詞藻。意境超出了民歌，而語言還是民歌的語言。</p>
<p>絕句的最上乘，前有老杜，後有楊誠斎。其次則王荆公，劉夢得，杜牧之。二十八個字的小詩，一千年來的作家寥寥如此！</p>
<p>十多年前，我曾想選一本一每天一首絕句」，想挑出三百六十五首絕句。此事至今擱置，只寫了一吉多首，以七絕爲絕大多數。將來我想從古民歌裏，如子夜歌等，選出五管的民歌；然後從近年出出的南方民歌裏選出一些七言的民歌。再加上一千多年中詩人做的五七言絕句，也許可以有三百六十五首。</p>
<p>詩人做的五言絕句，好的眞少。我最喜歡老杜的</p>
<p>漫道春來好。狂風好放類，吹花隨水去，翻却釣魚船。</p>
<p>我也喜歡　仝的一首：</p>
<p>村醉黃昏歸，健倒三四五。摩　靑莓苔，莫　驚著汝。放翁有一首，我也喜歡：</p>
<p>漲水入我廬，萍葉黏半扉。日出水返　。念汝何由歸。這種意境，都是民歌裏沒有的。你若記得有特別心愛的絕句，請寫一些給我。</p>

<h3>「先天道」</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>讀四日申報無錫通訊，無錫最近又破獲了所謂「先天道」的紐織，而且主犯經警察局逮捕審訊後，已「直認係先天道首腦不諱」。據警局所得的報告，主持這個組織的一個老道平時曾有「妖言惑衆，並有主使搶刼等不法行爲」。</p>
<p>誠然，我們也許可以用讀「火燒紅運寺」的眼光來讀這節新聞；但是，從另外一個角度來看，却實在不能不認爲這件事情是相當嚴重的。</p>
<p>第一，這種組織已經是三令五申的嚴禁過的了，何以竟仍舊能够秘密存在？所謂「妖言惑眾」也許就是「刀槍不入」這一套，無非是這稱組織的）種宣傳策略而已。眞正值得注意的，是維繫遣些徒眾的一種潛在的力量。以中國農民之萬事務求現實而論，還種潛在的力量是一定和他們的實生活發生了關係的。試看前文所引新聞原文中，除了「妖言惑眾」之外，不是還有更重要的「生使搶刼等不法行爲」麼！</p>
<p>所有「先天道」，「一貫道」，以及昔年的「白蓮敎」，和「義和團」等等，全都是在農村中擊長起來的。敎育不發達，於是一直到今天還到處有「愚夫愚婦」，小孩子着的方本小書裏多的是神仙妖道，戲院廣告中也常見到「僵尸拜月」。一般人的心理狀態似乎都祗保持着極脆弱的平衡，於是「妖言」興而「眾」遂「惑」了，甚至在全國最繁榮的京滬綫上的大都市無錫，竟也發生了「先天道」。胡適之先生在五四時代就要敦請賽德二先生到中國來，安知事隔三十餘年，「愚夫愚婦」之多如故！</p>
<p>不過，今日農村經濟的情形是否也間接刺激了這稱秘密親織的成長呢？誠知今人每日談治本者爲迂　，但是頭痛醫頭，脚痛　脚。雖於辦報銷時稱便，却究竟不是處理社會問題的辦法也。</p>
<h3>美國的雜誌</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>英美雖然是同文同種，但在一般文化的表現上却不盡相同，有時且相差得頭遠。例如就兩國的出版文化來者，不同之處是太多了。初期的美國文化當然是脫胎於其母國文化的，但隨着美國在生產經濟方面獨樹其領域，美國人民的生活文化也就逐漸別樹一格；美國建國的歷史雖然還短，可是我們今日已不能否認美國也有其獨特的民族文化了。</p>
<p>美國雜誌的風格和其特性，就是美國民族文化的一種獨特表現。</p>
<p>說起雜誌型的刊物，我們就不能不將其構成出版文化一大勢力的功績歸諸美國。雜誌型刋物的起源雖可追溯之於公報，　報，小册子，　集等古遠的出版方式，但其以簇新的姿熊與大量流行形式出現，還不過是二三十年間的事。而美國在第一次世界大戰後憑其雄厚的物力與財力，以及普及國民敎育的結果，大量的新型雜誌便應運而生。</p>
<p>今天說美國雜誌居世界出版界的皇座，恐怕並沒有禍份，而其對世界文化影響之大（好壞是另一個問題），也免不能否認的。讀美國小說，研究美國學術的人，雖不兌得如何多，然而能够閱讀英文而未曾君過一二美國雜誌的人，則恐怕是絕無僅有的了。</p>
<p>正惟因此，我們對於美國雜誌界的情形，不能不有一相當的瞭解。</p>
<p>美國是一個所謂美國式的民主國家，這反映於美國雜誌界的，便是思想的龐　。不過這裹僅想就其性質的分類介紹一下。</p>
<p>大概分別，美國的雜誌在性質上可以分成下面的幾類：</p>
<p>軟性雜誌（Pulp　magazines）——這類雜點佔美國雜誌的最大多數。內容主要是偵探小說，冒險故事，科學小說，戀愛故事，以及通俗的歷史演義等等，在戰時自然又添加了許多戰事小說或前綫趣味性的特寫。這類雜誌插圖豐富，定價却十分低廉，不過是說不上什麼文學水準的。</p>
<p>香艷雜誌（Slicks）——香艷不僅指其內容，也是指其裝幀圖畫而言。像「禮拜六週刊」（現在已略有變化）。「婦女家庭」，「美國雜誌」，「家庭之友」，以及較高級一些的「宇宙」等。此等雜誌印刷精良，每期登有許多長短篇小說，特寫等，是專供中等家庭主婦小姐們消遣的雜誌，而且有專門一派的作家執筆。在文學水準上，則是屬於二三流的。</p>
<p>以上兩類刊物，幾全部流銷國內，國外是不大多見的，因讀者多係美國人。</p>
<p>高級雜誌（Quality　magaznes）——這是泰牛屬於學術與文藝性的刊物。像「幸福」，「哈伴斯」，「耶魯評論」，「大西洋」，「文藝週評」，「論壇」等，此外更有地方性的刊物如「南方評論」（一九三五年創刊），New　Directions（一種專供少數高級讀者看的文學季刊）等。</p>
<p>綜合雜誌（Miscellany）——這類雜誌的特色，包括時事，政論，各色議論，書評，人物介紹，特寫等多角性的內容，像我們大家都知道的「時代」，「新聞週刊」，「民族」，「新共和」等。就是「生活」雜誌和「讀者文摘」，也不妨納入這一類。這類刊物是美國出版物中對國外影響最大的刊物。</p>
<p>貴族雜誌——貴族雜誌這名稱雖出自杜撰，但像「紳士」，「皇冕」，「小人國」等大小型的高級趣味雜誌，就其內容和精美的　圖言，實無以名之，衹好說是美國的貴族雜誌。其讀者羣恐怕也多半是中上階級的人物。</p>
<p>以上僅是一個槪略的介紹，此外汗牛充棟的電影，遊藝，滑稽連環圖畫，時裝，園藝等刊物，限於篇幅，衹好暫時從略了。</p>
<h3>怒髮衝冠</h3>
<p>— 李梨</p>
<p>在成語中，有「怒髮衝冠」一名，眞有這麼一回事嗎？我們的頭髮，眞的會豎起來嗎？</p>
<p>據生理學家的解釋是如此：因為極度緊張的戰　（高度的驚恐的憤怒，都會發生這種戰　），可以使緊接着皮　下面的細胞，頓然強烈地收縮起來，而連帶的使我們的頭髮，直綫地伸出去；每逢這種時候，我們的汗毛是直堅的，至於頭髪上的反應，雖然很弱，可是還能勉強說一下，來充分形容怒的程度之高。</p>
<p>其他，像兩隻雄雞在決鬥時，頸毛直豎；兩頭狗在廝打時，也頸毛直豎，也是由於憤怒。怒氣平息，則豎起的毛，也就恢復常態了。</p>
<h3>印章與署名</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>古人印章上所用字數之冗長者，除以七言詩句等製成不贅外，其在七字以上，今得數人：八字如淸楊鐵崖之「湖山風月福人之印」又明唐六如之「江南第一風流才子」，九字有明項孔彰之「我弗若人，人亦弗如我」，十字有元李仲實之「李　仲寶氏息齋道人印」，十二字有淸鄭板橋之「康熙秀才，雍正舉人，乾隆進土」，十四字有淸孫辰東之「其爲人也，爲寡髮，爲廣　，爲多白眼」，達十六字者有項孔彰之「點綴足神理，淋漓盡物情，項伯子自評爾」等。至其　名之最多者，得二人：一爲明人項聖謨，項字孔彰，號易庵，又號伯子，又大西，又古胥山人，共計六個。一爲淸人金農，金自　號日冬心先生，曰稽留山民，曰曲江外史，曰昔邪居士，曰籠　仙客，曰百二硯田富翁，曰心出家庵粥飯僧，共計八個。</p>
<h3>熱水瓶</h3>
<p>裹面是非常熱，外面卻是冰冷的，不表露出來，所以它的熱才能保持了。</p>
<p>它被無情的風吹落了，混和在泥土裏卻又供給了明春新葉發芽的養料。</p>
<h3>一笑集</h3>
<p>主婦：「你看架上的灰塵，至少已積了六個星期了。」</p>
<p>僕人：「那可與我不相干，我到這裏，還沒有到四星期。」</p>
<p>希臘某畫家畫了一價小孩子拿着一籃葡萄，栩栩如生，甚至於飛鳥會來啄那葡萄。大家同聲說好，而那畫家仍不滿意。他說：「小孩沒有提到鳥呢。」</p>
<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆　今猶未死之大阿哥</h3>
<p>— 禹壽</p>
<p>西太后以婦人而「雄猜」，視黜一皇帝立一皇帝如兒戲，心計之工，殆前賢雉墨所猶未能至也。彼與光緒之感情，在廣于拳變發生以前，已潰破至不可收抬。光緒二十六年一月，乃正式宣布以端郡王載漪之子溥　爲大阿哥，各曰承繼同治，實則儲以爲廢立光緒之備。</p>
<p>考之滿淸皇室宗牒，載漪爲　王奕　之第二子，惇王則先已出　於道光之第三弟，故就「皇統」之嚴格條件言之，載漪已不屬於道光之一支系。當西太后表示厭棄光緒，欲別爲同治立儲以後，皇室羣兒，　臂以爭者，實繁有從，據福　公「庚子國雙記」，以道光長房曾孫之溥倫溥侗二人，喧爭爲最烈，溥侗，即世所稱為紅豆館主，被目爲淸流，而一度以漢奸罪下獄者也。終以廢立大計，完全基於西太后個人之恩怨愛憎，此臨時方引載漪等以自重，卒不顧此種系統說，而決然選取溥儁爲大阿務。時爲公暦一八九九等，溥儁年裁十五，兇頑粗鹵，不曉人事。其被立後之第一事，爲派遣宮閣馳赴正陽門外為購一小馬歸。</p>
<p>舉變旣失敗，載漪所領導之暴力集團，完全崩潰，西太后時已挈光緒遠　西安，為求和計，載漪勢在必懲，而溥儁之大阿哥頭衙，亦遂同時以明詔廢去。禹壽今年赴北平，聞人言：溥儁今猶健在，已六十四歲，兩目悉育，生計窮　，惟寄食於什剎海畔某蒙古王府。客或與談五十年前事，輒引頸長號，謂太后待我恩如山岳重也。</p>
<p>滿淸所謂皇室近支，在民國之三十年動亂中，多已貧敗，蓋皆不事生產，而又揮霍無度也。元首戰後訪問舊都，欲得滿族人士賢者而用之，以示五族之勰調。醇王諸子，除載澧外，載洵載濤皆似未死，顧不脫紈袴惡習，猶強兀不受命焉。惟恭王之第二孫溥儒，得爲參政。懦字心畬，精繪事，與齊木匠白石齊名。</p>
<h3>識小祿</h3>
<p>— 延頤</p>
<p>燭</p>
<p>爲了使人家得到光明，不惜自己忍受最大的痛苦，直至力量　盡而後已。</p>
<h3>題梅的詩</h3>
<p>— 徐晋</p>
<p>舊暦的小春十月，快將過去，　起古人「十月先開　上梅」的詩句，我便聯想着張說詩裏「紫　」的村梅，社甫詩裏「江路香」的野梅，以及陸游詩裹「等閒開過」的園梅，上月間在復興公園那裹賞菊的雅興這時不期然而然的移轉到「冷香疑到骨」的梅花了。</p>
<p>恰巧一位多年不見的老友鄭重地拿了一面已繩寫好了字的扇面，要我隨便繪畫些花卉，不知自量的我就隨手提起筆來，盡上了梅花，在沒有卞筆以前，滿以爲這是雅興所至的應時作品；那知這扇面是古舊的，一經著筆，不管它淡墨或焦墨，全都起了分化作用，扇面上的梅花，浮現油光，形成了含有流動性原點滴模樣，怕誰也沒有雅興欣賞這一片模糊的扇頭梅花！</p>
<p>「這，怎麼辦？對於我那位久別重逢的鄭鄭重重請我繪畫的老友沒有交代了！」我這樣思索了一回，倒想出一個文過飾非的辦法來—抹去扇面左上角的油光，題上一首七絕詩；那詩是這樣的：</p>
<p>「禿筆浸　　扇頭，暗香浮動墨油油，且將晴雪融和意，付與梅枝點滴流。」</p>
<p>不一定詩中有畫或是畫中有詩，但是望文生義，還勉強可以自圓其說，無疑地這比較可以差強人意。</p>
<p>畫苑說梅有枯梅，新梅，繁梅，疏梅，山梅，野梅，江梅，園梅，宮梅，盤梅等十種，畫法各不相同，而且有首五絕詩說明：「十種梅花木，須憑墨色分，莫令無辨別，寫作一般春。」慚愧得很！我畫的那枝扇頭梅花並不在這十種梅花木之內。水墨油油色不分，雪梅混作一般春，那我只好說是一種別具風格的偶然的自我創作吧了。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第二章　娓娓淸談（六）</p>
<p>過了好一會，綺紈才由外面進來，蹙着肩頭道：「這時候還呌我去，眞是麻煩。」說着，坐在沙發上，仰着頭，兩眼看在屋內當中掛的那盞小小電燈只是出神。經過好一會，才決然喊王媽進來，吩咐道：「林局長再來電話，你告訴他，我上十八號看老太爺去了。」王媽笑着點頭出去。</p>
<p>渚齊正要問這位林局長是誰，綺紈卻笑道：「今夭難得你來，我只好對他說幾句假話，不去了。徐先生，你剛才不是問我學戲的過程嗎？我自十歲跟母鉀到上海，我母親在上海影片公司認得許多朋友，有時也在銀幕上客串一兩次，那時有個明明影片公司，附屬組織一個明明歌詠團，凡是電影界家屬，都可以參加學習跳舞和清唱。我那時已經會哼哼幾段小嗓，團裹各人都說我肯學戲，大概還有點出息，我母親便給我請一位呂桂與呂先生，夭天到我家裹，給我說戲。我學第一齣戲，是「宇宙鋒」，一齣戲連身段，帶唱腔，整整學了兩個月，先生才認爲沒有什麼不妥當的地方。以後呂先生又零七八碎給說了幾齣，上台客串了幾次，成績都不還不壞，我滿想去上海跟着母親，再學幾　舊戲，可是我父親一封信兩封信催我回去，我不得不回到北平。父親因爲是書香門第，不願意女兒出去學戲，我雖然和父親請求好幾次，父親只是不答應，後來我就在北平敎會學校上學了。一直到十六歲，父親因和上海戲院訂了合同，我才跟我父親到上海。那時和我父親合作的，有一位趙舜明先生，是我父親最要好的朋友，我父親平日最信任他。他見過我幾次，一力贊成我學戲，讓我自由發展，父親才動了心，說等回北平後，請位名師給我深造。等到我父親在戲院合同滿後，回到北平，老人家才允許我公開學戲，先跟名武旦　南峯先生學習幾個月，身上，唱上，才有點門徑，不幸閭先生病故了。因爲閻先生和朱蘭芬先生是親戚，閻先生死後，就由閻太太介紹，正式拜朱蘭芬先生門下，朱師　是　謹愼，最認眞的，他敎徒弟，一向決不肯馬馬虎虎的誤人。他第一齣敎我是「霸王別姬」，他因爲自已是武且的底子，雖然跟隨梅先生多年，對梅先生的身段當然是很淸楚，至於梅派腔調，還有不大了解的地方，他特爲我介紹一位徐桂芬先生，給我說戲。我父親因為朱徐兩位先生，對我都很熱心，特具帖請兩位先生在飯館裏，常面一再託付栽培，所以我學的第一齣梅派「霸五別姬」，並不困難，沒有多少天，全學會了。」</p>
<h3>「國瓷」與「舊京」</h3>
<p>勝利以後，聽說政府擬指令江西景德窰興辦紀念瓷器，名曰「勝利窰」，最近又聽說英國伊麗沙自公主婚禮，我國元首所贈精瓷一百七十五件，在禮堂展覽，各國代表同聲贊美，以爲得未曾有之美術。以上的消息，可使國人感到莫大之興味。</p>
<p>中國的名產，世界皆知以「絲，茶，瓷」爲三宗實，尤以瓷器爲中國工藝之代表。我國科學落伍，製造趕不上舶來物，以致向來人超甚大，惟瓷器一項，百餘年來领銷外洋，略可彌補。China一字，即含「中國」與「瓷」之兩義，關係詎不重哉。</p>
<p>全國瓷產，首推江西景德鎭，前淸以九江道台兼任　廠監督，提倡不遺餘力，因之該鎭各名廠產瓷大致分爲三級：　　瓷，　官瓷，　客貨。其進貫之瓷，有時是由北京內務府把宮內珍藏之寶石料及彩色頒發去做，做成之後，稍有不合款成或不甚精到者，飯令重做，故御用之　，精絕人寰。次則官窰亦以規矩嚴整爲特色，其客貨雖屬普通商品，亦較他處所造為優。</p>
<p>情代每一新君登極，必首先命辦紀元精瓷，而每次都能代表一代之作風。如康熙之三彩，雍正之靑華，乾隆之豆彩及　藍，嘉慶之五彩，道光之化島人物等等，皆有特徴。至老袁之「洪憲」皇帝雖只八十三天，然洪　瓷器乃將故宮御料發往精製者，故製造之精，幾與乾嘉同值。又因「袁皇」期短，出品無多，物稀爲貴，故瓷產雖在近代，而價值且超過咸同光而上之。老袁有此佳作，亦不負「九五」一塲了。</p>
<p>河北之瓷產甚多，有磁州產，有唐山產，稍細者無不標務江西。北平之瓷器舖各城皆有，最大者如前外大街之德泰，東四脾　之恒發，西四牌樓之德茂，皆規模宏敞，物品豐富，其貨物則有造貨與遊貨兩種，造貨係本地工匠承做，做法亦仿江西。辦貨則按時派人赴贛省採辦。</p>
<p>民國初年，「江西瓷業公司」在舊都開始營業，而一向標榜江西之本地店不免相形减色。「江西瓷業公司」一設於東安市塲之十字街口，一設於前門外之勸業塲樓上，出品之精，固屬冠絕此行，而售價之昂，亦令人咋舌。其產品大多是美術性，如盤盞碗壺之類，不等賣出，先自作木架錦匣，裝置玻璃窗中，竟是變相之「古玩舖」，以故廉價極高而離開大眾口常生活則愈遠。北政府時期，共銷路　為貴族家庭之陳設，　雅客之珍玩，　古玩舖購其仿之品，加以偽飾，當作古　販賣。</p>
<p>自民國十七年定都南京，北平改市，一般商業均見藉條，瓷業受影響尤巨，然而支持十年之久。直至二十六年倭難猝發，舊都淪陷，市况蕭沉爲從來所未見，東洋貨之仿古瓷又侵略此業，因之東城及前門外之兩個公司分店，先後關門，而本地之大瓷店恒發等亦相繼停業，所剩二三流之瓷鐵舖而已。</p>
<p>自此以至光復後的現在，市面所售瓷品至爲複雜，有大瓷廠所遺之江西瓷存貨，有日商日僑臨遺大批賣出之東洋瓷，有河北省附近出產之磁州瓷，唐山瓷，西山瓷。其中江西瓷之「公司出品」仍在古玩攤或高等百貨店陳設出傷。大瓷店　品售價略昂，商販投機，自造新聞，說江西瓷窰已被戰事破壞無餘，故存貨皆將成為珍品。</p>
<p>低讀南訊，知景德鎭窰廠雖受兵災，並未完全銷燬，令人心慰。至於如何振興，想南中賢哲及爲道諸公，當有良策。記者　地　聞，惟有佇盼好耳。</p>

The Sino-Dutch Civil Aviation Agreement is scheduled to be signed in Nanjing on the 6th.

<h3>The Need for U.S. Dollars for the Three Gorges Hydropower Project is Too Great</h3>
<p>Weng Wenhao States Work is Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] After reporting on the recent developments of the National Resources Commission, Weng Wenhao answered questions from the councilors, as summarized below:</p>
<p>Xue Mingjian raised three points:  The National Resources Commission's institutions can now manufacture locomotives themselves, but the Jinpu Railway still uses foreign locomotives and awaits the purchase of foreign goods to solve the problem. I asked the railway why they don't use domestically produced goods. The person in charge of the railway said: because the manufacturing plant is not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, they still have to buy foreign goods. Please inform me of the actual situation and why coordination is not being carried out.  How will the government seek remedial measures for the coal shortage problem?  Many machine factories have stopped work, reportedly because there is nothing to do. Can the National Resources Commission lead state-owned factories and design a project while also leading private factories to engage in production to reach pre-war production levels? Yin Shuxian asked why the Savage Three Gorges Hydropower Project has been suspended. Weng replied as follows:  The locomotives produced by the Shenyang Locomotive Manufacturing Plant use some foreign exchange for materials, so the price is slightly more expensive than foreign goods. However, the freight cars are entirely domestically produced, so they are much cheaper than foreign goods. The plant has already sold all of the more than 900 freight cars it has produced to the Ministry of Transportation.  Regarding the remedial measures for coal, there are currently several approaches: first, to strengthen the transportation capacity of northern coal to the south, and to increase the production and external transportation of several coal mines in Huainan, Hunan, Taiwan, and other places. The second is to replace it with diesel.  The machine factory has already manufactured spinning spindles (the factory is privately run and is the only large factory in the country). 4,000 spindles will be delivered by the end of the year, but concrete design and manufacturing are still difficult. Regarding the Savage Hydropower Project, because the need for U.S. dollars is too great and the U.S. loan to us cannot be used solely for this construction, the government has not abandoned this project, but due to the facts, it cannot but be temporarily suspended.</p>

After arriving in Japan, in addition to the mission to Japan being responsible for supplying non-staple food, the staple food will still be transported from the Shanghai Port Command. The new uniforms for the officers have already been made, made of Northwest wool, steel helmets, and white gloves, fully armed. Li is scheduled to go to Nanjing on the 7th to request instructions from the Military Police Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on everything.</p>

He said: "The American people are very eager to understand the progress of our country towards democratic constitutionalism. We should immediately provide them with various objective and accurate materials to promote their understanding of us." When asked by reporters whether he intended to visit the US government authorities, Zhang said: "If necessary, I would be happy to exchange views with the US government on general issues." Regarding the political system after the implementation of the constitution, he said that in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, there will be major changes in the organization of the government at that time. The functions of the Legislative Yuan will be greatly strengthened, and the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan will become closer. With the proper application of the responsible cabinet system, China's politics will undoubtedly enter a new stage. Zhang also said that the organization of various departments of the new government has been largely drafted, and the only thing that remains to be resolved is the organization of the Presidential Office. The Presidential Offices of the United States and France are very simple, so the decision should not be made to make our Presidential Office too large. Zhang analyzed the progress of the negotiations between the three parties on the list of candidates for legislators and supervisors. He said that the Democratic Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party can each obtain 75 legislative seats, which the Kuomintang has agreed to. What is currently being discussed is only the issue of regional allocation.

The Democratic Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party are currently exchanging views on which party should nominate candidates in each province and city. It is expected that the announcement of the list of legislators and supervisors can be realized soon. Zhang also said that the National Assembly will not be postponed, but the official opening date will be determined after a sufficient number of National Assembly representatives have registered.</p>
<h3>U.S. Foreign Aid Bill</h3>
<p>A Republican Congressman Requests Amendment</p>
<p>[News Report] New York, 5th Radio: Washington News, Republican Congressman Jonesman told the House today that he will propose an amendment to cut the $590 million in emergency foreign aid by $290 million. If this amendment is proposed, it will become the largest cut. Republican Congressman Zeb, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, believes that $590 million is too much and the committee will reduce it. Jackson, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that emergency aid alone is not enough to stop communism, but if this bill is not passed, France and Italy will be controlled by the Communist Party this winter.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] As a result of the House vote, the debate on the $590 million foreign emergency relief bill was limited to twelve hours, and the initial victory was won on the 4th. It is expected that the general debate will end on the night of the 5th. After that, the case will be publicly amended. At least six congressmen have already declared that they will propose amendments. Republican Congressman Jude, who is responsible for including $60 million in aid to China in the foreign aid bill, said that if China does not have US aid, it is completely subject to Soviet control may. He went on to say that if this happens, the Soviet Union will be able to turn around and conquer the world. Democratic Congressman Cox also urged the passage of the bill as a gamble that the United States is forced to undertake for its own security.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 4th] The House of Representatives' handling of its temporary assistance bill for China, Austria, France, and Italy has reached the amendment stage today. Acting Secretary of State Lovett told the Senate Appropriations Committee that if the aid-receiving country is once placed under the control of the Communist Party, emergency aid must be stopped.</p>
<h3>Date of Convening the National Assembly to be Determined by the Total Number of National Assembly Representatives Elected; Hong Lanyou Explains the Significance of Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] There are many rumors about whether the National Assembly will be held as scheduled. Chairman Chiang and Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election Commission, have repeatedly stated that it must be held as scheduled, but based on recent signs, it seems that it has to be postponed. According to Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Election Commission, the statement about the postponement of the National Assembly is actually based on the assumption that the National Assembly will be convened on December 25th. The implementation of the constitution and the convening of the National Assembly on December 25th cannot be confused. He said that the convening of the National Assembly will be determined by the number of representatives elected. If the number of elected representatives reaches two-thirds of the total, then an order can be issued to convene the meeting in accordance with the law. He further said that since the promulgation of the constitution on New Year's Day this year, our preparations for various constitutional governance, as well as the handling of general elections, can also be said to be constitutional governance. According to someone's conversation, it is clearly pointed out that the convening period of the National Assembly is not yet determined to be December 25th, so there is no so-called postponement.</p>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch, 5th] The ceremony for the election of supervisors of the Guangdong Province was held at 8:00 a.m. on the 5th, at the same time as the third regular meeting of the Provincial Council, but the election will be held pending notification from the Central Government.</p>
<h3>The Provisional Council Requests Personnel Adjustments; The Members of the Hebei Provincial Government Resign En Masse; Speaker Liu Yaozhang Speaks on This Matter</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] The Hebei Provincial Government's personnel issues have finally led to the heads of various departments and offices resigning for two reasons:  The Hebei Provisional Council has always been dissatisfied with the provincial government and has requested personnel adjustments. Last night, during a dinner with 29 councilors, one councilor made an informal survey, and the results showed that 19 councilors supported a partial reorganization of the provincial government, 8 supported a thorough reorganization, and 2 had no opinion. However, they all expressed their support for Chairman Sun. This result was presented to the General Assembly this morning for a resolution. Speaker Liu Yaozhang will first consult with Chairman Sun before making a concrete vote.  The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters is about to be established. In view of the necessity of future military-government cooperation, the Hebei Provincial Government has expressed its intention to resign to Chairman Chiang, who has not agreed. This method is now being proposed. It is reported that Sun Lianzhong's intention to resign is also firm.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] All members of the Hebei Provincial Government (concurrently Secretary-General) and the heads of various departments submitted their resignations to Chairman Sun Lianzhong in two memoranda today. The wording of the two memoranda is similar. The former reads as follows: Dear Sir, Ai Song (Secretary-General) and others were ordered by the Central Government to follow you, participate in provincial affairs, and serve the people of Hebei. We originally hoped to do our best to overcome difficulties together, but since taking office, we have found that our abilities are insufficient, and things have not gone as we wished. We have failed to meet your expectations and are filled with trepidation. Now, at the opportunity of the development of the overall situation in North China, it is an opportunity for the political renewal of our province. Ai Song and others followed you to rescue our hometown and relieve difficulties, and should now retire to promote the construction of our hometown. Our humble sincerity has been stated repeatedly in person. We now earnestly request that you immediately telegraph the Central Government to approve our resignations from our concurrent posts, and appoint other capable people to replace us. We are waiting anxiously for your special order.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] After learning that the heads of various departments and offices of the Hebei Provincial Government had resigned en masse, Liu Yaozhang, Speaker of the Hebei Provisional Council, invited reporters and said: This is expected. Many within and outside the Provisional Council believe that personnel adjustments are necessary. The question is how to adjust them. Vice-Speaker Hao Zhuo has been asked to meet with Chairman Sun to report the situation of the General Assembly. It is believed that Chairman Sun will adopt the opinions of the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Implement Secret Plan to Use the Peace Conference to Obtain Former Territories and Disintegrate Existing Democratic Institutions</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] The New York Post today published a Tokyo special dispatch saying that someone has obtained secret documents, learning that the Japanese authorities are preparing to use the future peace treaty with Japan to eliminate the various reforms implemented in Japan by the Allied occupation policy, and to shatter Japan's existing democratic institutions beyond recognition. This secret document was drafted by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a means of implying the ambitions of the Japanese authorities, attempting to prevent the various reforms that the United States has made it accept from being permanent, and to preserve its industrial strength and recover its lost territories.</p>
<p>(United Press, Tokyo, 5th) Japan has several secret action plans for the future peace treaty. One of them was revealed by insiders today. According to reports, Japan plans to launch a movement demanding the most favorable terms. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now drafted several contingency steps.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Compensation Equipment from Japan Can be Applied After Repair</h3>
<p>[News Report] According to people who have seen the first batch of compensation materials from Japan: "The essence of this batch of industrial equipment is not bad, but because the Allied personnel's management is not strict, allowing it to rust and be lost, the cost of repairing and installing it after it arrives in our country in the future will inevitably be astonishing. I hope that all sectors of our public and private sectors who are preparing to use this material can be prepared. The second batch of materials is mostly Japanese aviation industrial equipment, with excellent quality, but it is still difficult to estimate when it will be distributed to various countries."</p>
<h3>Japan Intends to List Industrial Equipment Left in China as Compensation Items</h3>
<p>Allied Headquarters Investigation Delegation to Come to China Soon</p>
<p>[News Report] It is reported that the Allied Headquarters in Japan will soon entrust a consultant expert-level investigation delegation to investigate the Japanese compensation issue. The delegation of twelve people, led by delegation leader Mr. Wyeor, will come to China on the 15th of this month. It is said that the delegation's mission has three purposes:  Investigate the amount of Japanese property originally in China.  Whether China has the ability to absorb and utilize the compensation materials obtained from Japan.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Japanese have explained to the Allied Headquarters that Japan may list half of the materials that can be listed as compensation from domestic and foreign sources, so they requested that all industrial equipment originally belonging to our country's Northeast, Taiwan, Korea, etc., also be included in the list of compensation materials.</p>
<p>Relevant parties expressed their opinions to reporters yesterday on this matter, believing that if the Allied Headquarters does follow Japan's request, our country will not be able to share the remaining compensation materials at the future peace conference with Japan. In fact, the Japanese proposal is purely absurd. Because:  The depreciation rate applied by the Japanese to industrial equipment is generally between eight and ten years. Most of the industrial equipment left in China has exceeded the prescribed depreciation period.  The original industrial equipment in China, such as the textile industrial equipment in the coastal provinces, is now being utilized to the fullest extent.  The industrial equipment left in China by the Japanese was greatly damaged during the war and was mostly bombed by the Allied forces. Most of the equipment that is now being taken is equipment that our country has repaired and re-added itself. Based on the above points, the Japanese proposal to transfer the industrial equipment left in China to compensation materials is of course untenable.</p>

<h3>Welcome to the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe</h3>
<p>The Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is scheduled to meet the people of Shanghai tonight for the first time with their singing and dancing skills. We express our sincere welcome to the arrival of this troupe. The historical relationship between China and Xinjiang has existed since the Han Dynasty, spanning thousands of years. Over these two thousand years, there has been contact between the Chinese interior and Xinjiang from time to time, but due to traffic obstructions, the Chinese interior and border regions have not been able to achieve the ideal state of cultural integration. Our understanding of Xinjiang is still insufficient; even the border regions inevitably have misunderstandings about the interior. For the sake of the nation's future, this regrettable phenomenon should be eliminated as soon as possible. Although there is more than one way to eliminate this phenomenon, nothing is more important than increasing contact between each other so that mutual understanding can be enhanced. The Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe's coming east has the mission of promoting mutual understanding. It is in this sense that we welcome the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe's coming east. However, as we see this song and dance troupe coming from the northwestern border, traveling thousands of miles east, arriving in Shanghai, and about to meet the people of Shanghai with their ethnic songs and dances today, in addition to expressing our sincere welcome and wishing them a safe journey, we would like to reiterate a few words, hoping to encourage each other: First, according to the Constitution formulated by the National Assembly last year, the Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, governed by the people, owned by the people, and enjoyed by the people; therefore, the Three Principles of the People are the basic guidelines for our country's establishment. According to the nationalism of the Three Principles of the People, there are two aspects: external and internal. On the external side, the nationalism of the Three Principles of the People seeks the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation; on the internal side, it seeks the freedom and equality of the various ethnic groups that make up the Chinese nation. Xinjiang is far from the border, and there are different ethnic groups within the territory. The various ethnic groups within Xinjiang should be free and equal; that is, the various ethnic groups within Xinjiang should also be free and equal with other ethnic groups within the Chinese territory. The Chinese nation is a nation that includes many ethnic groups. The various constituent ethnic groups may not necessarily be the same in terms of language and culture, but they are all constituent members of the Chinese nation. Since they are all constituent members, they are as close as brothers. Today, we welcome the coming east of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, as if we have the feeling of welcoming a brother returning from afar.</p>
<p>Second, the ethnic policy of the Three Principles of the People is to support the self-development of border compatriots, and especially to pay attention to the development of their inherent culture. The constituent members of the Chinese nation are not simple, and the various constituent members often form unique lifestyles and cultural characteristics due to their historical and geographical factors. The upright and peaceful ideals of the Three Principles of the People lie in maintaining the development of the inherent cultural life of border compatriots. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang convened the Second Plenary Session and resolved: "Our party's intention towards border compatriots has always been to help them develop, join hands and move forward, and strive to achieve a prosperous and happy situation together." In July last year, the central government adhered to the established national policy and reorganized the Xinjiang Provincial Government; all nineteen members of the provincial government were filled by people from the Han, Han-Hui, Uyghur, Mongol, Khalkh, Uzbek, and Kyrgyz ethnic groups. Although the development of the situation in Xinjiang after this has not been as expected, with the openness of the policies adopted by our government, we hope that all compatriots across the country can jointly support the central government's decisions, intensify cooperation, and unite the interior and border regions.</p>
<p>Third, as far as Xinjiang is concerned, although the ethnic groups inhabited by the residents are not the same, the Uyghur ethnic group is undoubtedly the main ethnic group in Xinjiang. Regarding the exchanges between this ethnic group and China, historical records show that since the Huihe of the Tang Dynasty, through the Uyghur of the Yuan Dynasty, to modern times, the influence of Uyghur culture on our Han culture has been profound and significant. The so-called "national music" today contains many Uyghur components. The old erhu and the like are all from the West, that is, musical instruments passed down directly from the hands of the Uyghur people of Xinjiang. At the same time as these musical instruments were passed down, there was also "Western Regions," that is, Xinjiang music.</p>
<p>There is also "Western Regions," that is, Xinjiang music. Although many of the musical scales have been lost, the musical instruments are still preserved. The coming east of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe today makes us recall the prosperity of the Han and Tang dynasties. May the coming east of this cultural mission be able to re-generate the interaction in the development of our national culture, thus emitting a new brilliant light.</p>
<p>Cultural exchange is originally a two-way matter. Today, we welcome the coming east of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe, and hope that after this song and dance troupe, the contact between Xinjiang and the interior can become more frequent. In addition to the song and dance troupe, there can also be other inspection and visiting groups coming east one after another. On our side, there should also be various organizations to go to Xinjiang in response. Only in this way can mutual exchanges achieve the practical effect of enhancing mutual understanding and promoting cultural exchange. We hope that the interest in the border regions caused by the coming east of the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe this time can also promote the organization of similar visiting groups to Xinjiang, so that the people of the border regions can further increase their understanding of the interior, and achieve the purpose of mutual exchange.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Provincial Assembly Closes, Preparing to Welcome Newly Selected Senators</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 5th] The Shaanxi Provincial Assembly opened this morning.

Shaanxi Provincial Chairman Zhu Shaoju said in his opening speech: Bandit alarms have occurred this autumn in northern Shaanxi, southern Shaanxi, Tongguan, Huanglong Mountain, and other places, causing heavy casualties. The magistrates of Jingbian and Shanyang counties died in the line of duty, and the magistrates of Jiaxian, Yanchuan, and Qingjian counties are missing. Due to the suppression of communist bandits, the burden on the people has not been reduced, and construction plans cannot be implemented step by step.

<h3>Zhejiang Administrative Conference, Policy Reports from Various Offices</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] At today's Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference, the directors of various offices reported on their respective policies and elaborated on the five central proposals put forward by Chairman Shen. First, Ruan reported on civil affairs, saying that the abolition of four special districts this year, the reduction of county government staffing, and the merger of townships were all inevitably biased towards financial purposes. However, the salaries of county-level personnel still failed to meet the central government's standards. Funding collected under the land tax was still far from the amount needed. The election was considered smooth because administrative personnel at all levels were fair, detached, and legal. No bloodshed or election lawsuits occurred throughout the province during this election. Efforts to ban opium still need to be strengthened. Next year, when the Constitution is implemented, provincial and county people's representative conferences will be convened to formulate provincial and county self-government laws and re-elect provincial and county councils. County and city mayors will be popularly elected, so efforts should be doubled to promote local self-government, and the organization of household registration and the improvement of township and baojia systems are especially important. Subsequently, the persons in charge of finance, education, construction, social affairs, land and grain, accounting, security, and the military control district headquarters respectively reported on their policies and reviewed various issues.</p>

<h3>The Four Foreign Ministers Will Begin Discussions on the Economic Unification of Germany, and Discussions on the Austrian Peace Treaty Have Again Reached a Stalemate</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall requested in the Foreign Ministers' meeting today that the fundamental issues of Germany be discussed, so as to end the current state of division in Germany. He said, "I suggest that we should abandon the general discussions on the establishment of a German central government, and should frankly explain the true intentions of the representatives of various countries. Do the participating countries hope to create a situation that makes the political and economic unification of Germany possible? We do hope that the provisional government can be established, but the question is whether the establishment of a central government can truly solve the current problems. We hope that Germany has a real government, and do not care if it is just a self-deceiving organization."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed the Austrian issue today. Due to Molotov's refusal to issue a detailed statement on the Soviet Union's request to acquire German assets in Austria, Marshall suggested that the Austrian issue be put aside for the time being, and that the next item on the agenda, the economic principles of Germany, be discussed instead. The latter will begin to be discussed tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] Officials attending the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting today declared that US Secretary of State Marshall had a fierce quarrel with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday. This was the first time in this meeting, and as a result, the meeting again reached a stalemate. First, Molotov directly mentioned the Marshall Plan, accusing the United States and Britain of attempting to "enslave" Austria through aid measures. Marshall was very indignant upon hearing this, and immediately declared that the distortion of the motives of the United States had been heard many times, and that such accusations were unfounded. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also refuted Molotov's word "enslavement". Marshall, Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault successively questioned Molotov about how much the Soviet Union wanted to claim for German assets in Austria. Molotov replied after listening, "10% less than what we deserve." When asked 10% of what? He said, "What was decided at the Potsdam Conference." Marshall said that the United States had no intention of abandoning the Potsdam Agreement, but it would not allow it to be misinterpreted. Molotov wanted to take over German assets in Austria by force, coercion, and other illegal means. Finally, Bevin asked Molotov to come up with a concrete plan for the assets in Austria for the Foreign Ministers' meeting to review, but Molotov refused. It is believed that Marshall is about to suggest dismantling the current occupation zones in Germany.</p>
<h3>Britain Presents Draft Four-Power Treaty to the United States to Guarantee the Disarmament of Germany for Fifty Years</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] It is reported that the British government has presented a detailed draft of the Four-Power Treaty to the US government to guarantee the disarmament and demilitarization of Germany. The drafting of the treaty began a considerable time ago and is only now being announced. However, officials still refuse to disclose its details. The Chicago Sun published the main points of the draft treaty today. The two most interesting points are: Britain suggests that the period for ensuring Germany's disarmament should be fifty years, which is ten years longer than the original US suggestion. The British suggestion does not give any of the four powers a veto power to oppose the enforcement of the disarmament of Germany. The consensus of three of the four powers is sufficient. The newspaper also said that Article 4 of the draft treaty proposed by Britain goes a step further than the original suggestion of former US Secretary of State Byrnes, and advocates extending the disarmament of Germany to the economic and political aspects.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Reiterates Territorial Claims Against Austria</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Yugoslav Ambassador to Britain, Leon Gerovski, declared in London on the 4th that the Yugoslav government has reiterated the Carinthia issue and has requested the Foreign Ministers' meeting to give it an opportunity to present its views when discussing the Austrian Treaty. Gerovski also said that the incorporation of Carinthia, a Yugoslav territory, into Yugoslavia is Yugoslavia's main demand. Other demands include compensation and restitution, resolving the problem of exiled people, extraditing war criminals, resolving the issue of enemy property in Yugoslavia, and protecting ethnic minorities in Austria. Gerovski also said that the previous rejections of Yugoslavia's demands were due to the attitude of the Western powers.</p>
<h3>Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber Meets with Molotov</h3>

<h3>Allied Control Council Approves Austrian Currency Reform</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 4th] After meeting here on the 4th, the Allied Control Council for Austria has approved the Austrian government's recently announced currency reform and resolved three items regarding the method of considering the placement of Austrian currency held by the Allied countries: The Austrian government will issue 11 million schillings (Austrian currency name) of new currency to each Allied High Commissioner and withdraw the equivalent amount of new currency for Allied personnel to exchange. The old Austrian currency held by the Allied forces will be exchanged according to the methods stipulated by their commanders-in-chief, without going through Austrian new currency exchange. Austria shall treat the bank deposits of each occupying country equally and shall not discriminate. The Soviet authorities also reached an agreement with the Austrian government that Austria would pay the Soviet Union 500 million schillings to redeem the deposits in the Soviet State Bank. In addition, it was stipulated that the Austrian debt of 600 million schillings to the Soviet Union would be settled to repay the German marks loaned by the Soviet authorities to the Austrian government in April 1945. The US representative to the Allied Control Council made a special statement that the United States' agreement to approve the Austrian currency reform did not mean that it also agreed with the agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and Austria. It is believed here that the United States is dissatisfied with the part of the agreement that resolves the debt.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Paris News, 10,000 French colonial troops are stationed at various strategic points in Marseille today to deal with strikers. The anti-strike bill has been submitted to the French Republic's upper house and is expected to be passed soon. The situation is tense throughout France, and clashes have occurred between strikers and the police in many areas.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] After the National Assembly passed the government's anti-strike bill by a vote of 413 to 183 in the early morning of the 4th, the bill is scheduled to be submitted to the Senate for discussion on Friday. The National Assembly will also discuss two other emergency measures starting on Friday to give the government greater power to maintain law and order: one is a bill to reorganize the Republican Security Corps, a semi-military police force formed shortly after the end of the war to absorb wartime postal teams, so many of its members are communists; another measure is to propose a supplementary budget to enable the government to subsidize local governments to strengthen the police force.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 5th] The strike of 1.2 million civil servants began to be implemented. In Paris, at 8 am on the 5th, due to the power plant being shut down, all factories and subways were completely shut down, and the lights were all out.

<p>[United Press, Paris, 5th] The three major associations organized by French government employees, the National Education Association, the General Economic Association, and the General Administrative Association, rejected the government's response of raising salaries and redistributing grades on the 5th, and ordered their members to immediately begin a five-day warning strike. Then government employees will join 2 million striking workers, and the national strike has lasted for three weeks, and violence and destruction are escalating.</p>
<p>European Countries Receiving US Aid Must Still Be Self-Reliant [Reuters, Hollywood, 4th] US Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Thawlby, gave a speech here to the Association of American Investment Bankers on the 4th, stating that under the Marshall Plan for European aid, the United States will be a "smart" banker, and will not only appear as a "rich" banker. Thawlby strongly stated that the sixteen European countries that have obtained US aid must not allow any "country" to have the impression that "because there is a rich uncle across the ocean, it is okay to reduce their own efforts." The main part of the economic effort must be undertaken by the European countries themselves. Thawlby continued that the experts from the sixteen European countries estimated in their research in Paris that the import surplus of these sixteen countries in trade with the rest of the world in 1948 was 8 billion yuan. Assuming that 1948 is the first year of implementing the Marshall Plan, the United States estimates that it should bear 6 billion yuan of this import surplus in the first fiscal year of implementing the European aid plan, which is about 10% of the US national income. The European recovery plan should be based on European efforts and its success should be transformed by the assistance of the United States and other countries, but Europeans must recognize that the United States will not donate a cent to Europe that does not care about self-reliance.</p>

<h3>The Independent State of Burma Will Be Born in Five Days, and the Communist Party Is Rampant in Central Burma</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Sources in this question claim that the Independent Sovereign Republic of Burma will be established next Wednesday. Britain is scheduled to officially hand over the government of Burma to Burma on January 4.

<h3>New Dispute Arises in the Widening of Tianmu Road; Xiang Sheng Company Voluntarily Demolishes Houses, Neighboring Residents Surround and Prevent It</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Another dispute suddenly arose yesterday regarding the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road. Previously, the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road had faced several twists and turns. Later, the Mayor personally went to the site for inspection. As a result, to consider the residents, apart from Xiechang Timber Company and Huizhong Tobacco Factory, which still had ample space after demolition and were required to demolish themselves before the end of this year, the remaining households were allowed to demolish after the old lunar new year. However, at 4:00 PM yesterday, Xiang Sheng Transportation Company's houses in the area began to be demolished voluntarily, which aroused dissatisfaction among nearby residents, who went to question and surrounded the area to prevent it. When reporters arrived, neighboring residents rushed to tell them that Xiang Sheng and the Public Works Bureau had privately negotiated, and the originally planned demolition area was very large. Later, after the Public Works Bureau sent people to inspect again, it agreed to relax the requirement to 8 meters. Xiang Sheng Company, in order to take advantage of this, proceeded with the voluntary demolition. However, according to the person in charge of Xiang Sheng, it was completely executing the orders of the Public Works Bureau. He also said that He Guanghan of the First District Public Works Management Office of the Public Works Bureau had visited twice yesterday morning at 10:00 AM and afternoon at 3:00 PM, ordering the demolition to be carried out immediately. The dispute had not been resolved until last night, and it is still waiting for the Public Works Bureau to send someone to negotiate and handle it today.</p>

After approval by the Municipal Council, it has been approved to reduce the demolition by 2 meters.</p>

<h3>Promote Culture and Enhance Art; Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe to Perform Starting Today; Grand Welcome Reception Held at the Lido Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] All circles in Shanghai held a grand tea party at the Lido Garden yesterday to welcome the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe. Those present included Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Director Fang, Yu Wen, Yang Hu, Stuart, Xu Jilou, Wang Yunsheng, Wu Yunxu, Zhou Xinfang, Jiu Ailian, Xie Renzhao, Liu Deming, and other representatives from all walks of life, about 500 people. Fu Wei Baoerhan and Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Northwest Headquarters, also attended the event. At 3:00 PM, the song and dance troupe arrived at the Lido, and the masses rushed to watch, in high spirits. Inside the venue, red silk banners were hung high, reading "Promote National Culture", "Connect National Feelings", "Enhance National Art", and "Unite National Spirit", creating a solemn and dignified atmosphere.</p>
<p>Outstanding People and Excellent Art</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying: "The birthplace of King Wu of Zhou is said to be the Queen Mother's Jade Pool in history, which is actually the northwest of our country today. It is said that the scenery there is more beautiful than any modernized scenery in the world. The land is blessed with outstanding people, so the Northwest nationalities not only have lofty achievements in art, but also make extremely important contributions to national defense. In the past, transportation was inconvenient, and there were fewer opportunities for contact between various nationalities in the country. Now, the whole country is one family, and I believe that cooperation and understanding between various nationalities will become closer in the future. This time, the song and dance troupe visited the inland, and I hope that we will not only achieve the exchange of art and culture, but also that Xinjiang compatriots and Southeast compatriots will take this opportunity to exchange views and fully express their fervent love for their compatriots."</p>
<p>Visiting from Afar; Extreme Gratification</p>
<p>Speaker Pan then delivered a welcoming speech, roughly dividing it into three points: China is composed of several major nationalities. Due to historical and cultural factors, although they are far apart from each other and there are differences in language and writing, they have always been harmonious for thousands of years. This time, the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe has come to Shanghai from afar. The citizens of Shanghai feel as if they are reuniting with family members who have been separated for a long time. In addition to gratification, they warmly welcome them. I hope that the song and dance troupe can take this feeling back and tell it to the compatriots in Xinjiang. When Wallace visited the Northwest during the Anti-Japanese War and returned to Chongqing, he said, "I come from China's door." The Northwest is China's land gate, and Shanghai is China's sea gate. They have the same importance in national defense. Now that the country is moving towards democratic construction, it is especially hoped that Northwest compatriots and Southeast compatriots will cooperate and share the arduous task. Shanghai is a gathering place for people from all walks of life. It is hoped that the song and dance troupe will introduce the living conditions of Northwest compatriots as much as possible, so that people from all walks of life can fully understand and promote genuine national unity.</p>
<p>Xinjiang Compatriots Have Awakened</p>
<p>Director Fang, Commander Xuan, Zhou Xinfang, Wang Yunsheng, Wu Yunxu, and others then delivered speeches in succession, expressing their welcome. Finally, Fu Wei Baoerhan, representing the song and dance troupe, delivered a reply, saying: "In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, Xinjiang was separated from the inland for a long time. Especially because we failed to receive cooperation and guidance from all parties, everything was regressing and lagging behind. In recent years, Xinjiang compatriots have awakened and launched anti-despotism movements several times. After General Zhang Zhizhong took charge of Xinjiang and resolutely implemented the principle of national equality, the people of Xinjiang finally regained their freedom. The song and dance troupe's visit to the inland this time was promoted by General Zhang. Although their artistic achievements are not deep, they can at least introduce the living conditions of the Xinjiang people to the Southeast compatriots. I can declare on behalf of the people of Xinjiang that Xinjiang will always be the territory of the Republic of China, and the people of Xinjiang will always be the people of the Republic of China. The entire people of Xinjiang have only one hope: to quickly establish a new democratic and independent China. I believe that starting from this visit of the song and dance troupe, everyone will be able to base themselves on this common understanding and work hard to build a new free China." Bao concluded by shouting "Long live the Republic of China" and "Eternal unity of the Chinese nation" several times in fluent Mandarin, his emotions overflowing, winning cheers from the audience. The Mayor rose to deliver a speech during the welcome meeting. (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Literary Evening Party to Host Guests</p>
<p>After the speeches, Xie Renzhao introduced all the members of the song and dance troupe to the guests. The youngest members of the troupe, Wuliya (10 years old) and Wuluhan (8 years old), also stood up and waved frequently to people from all walks of life, making them very cordial.</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM last night, all circles in Shanghai held a literary evening party at the Cultural Hall to entertain the troupe. Speaker Pan and Mu Hanmo De, Director of Construction of Xinjiang Province, also personally presided over the event. All members of the troupe were extremely interested in the performances of the Fuchen Dance and magic techniques, saying that this kind of pure Eastern-style performance was no different in Xinjiang and the inland, so they felt even more strongly that the unity between domestic nationalities would become closer in the future, in addition to being grateful for the enthusiasm of the Shanghai compatriots.</p>
<p>The troupe will officially perform at the Queen Theater starting at 9:00 PM tonight. Today is for guests from all circles in Shanghai to visit, and tomorrow tickets will be sold to the public for performances for a week.</p>
<p>Flower of the Uyghur; Invited to Cut the Ribbon</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Military Friends General Agency's new Military Friends Salon at No. 168 Haining Road is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at noon today, presided over by Commander Pan and Director Fang.

<h3>Flying Together; Getting Married in Mid-Air; Airplane as Wedding Hall</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At 10:00 AM yesterday, a couple took Central Airlines' XTT39 Shanghai-Peiping passenger plane from Longhua Airport to hold their wedding in the air, which can be said to be a unique page in the wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>The groom, Jiang Renshan, is from Yuyao, Zhejiang. He is 43 years old and the cousin of Jiang Menglin, the former Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and the manager of Zhongtai Yarn Store at No. 121 Jiangxi Road. This is his second marriage. The bride, Li Danru, is from Dantu, Jiangsu. She is 26 years old and a graduate of the Xiehe Nursing School affiliated with the Red House Hospital in Ximen, Shanghai.</p>
<p>The XTT39 planes fly the Shanghai-Peiping route, passing through Nanjing on the way. It should have taken off from Longhua at 6:00 AM, but it was specially delayed by three hours for them. There was not enough time to fly back and forth from Peiping that day. This plane was not their chartered plane. They bought tickets like ordinary passengers and invited 18 relatives and friends to go with them, including Hua Maohang manager Shen Baonian, who was the wedding emcee, and a photographer.</p>
<p>At 9:45, the couple arrived by car. The groom wore a long gown and mandarin jacket with a flower pinned to his chest. The bride wore a white纱 wedding dress with a gray coat. When the two walked into the waiting room with smiles, they attracted many people to watch the excitement.</p>
<p>The staff of Central Airlines looked beaming. Cai Zhiren, the station manager in Shanghai, directed the decorations, tying several strings of cypress branches and flowers on top of the seats in the fuselage. The entrance to the plane was decorated in the same way, and a red paper with "The House of Jiang and Li is Celebrating" written in brush was pasted next to the door. A small red carpet was laid on the ground below the steps of the mobile ladder. A square table covered with red silk was placed next to the plane, with two baskets of light red Wanlan flowers on the table. In addition, the guide presented a congratulatory red silk banner with "Phoenix and Minghe Harmonious" written in art characters, ready for the bride and groom to sign when boarding the plane. A radio was specially installed in the plane.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, the loudspeaker broadcasted "Please board the plane, bride and groom," followed by the Wedding March. The couple walked slowly from the waiting room to the side of the plane, signed the red silk on the table, and then stood on the ladder and at the plane door for photos. Air hostess Wei Delian smiled and served as their bridesmaid, also appearing in the photos. Then, amid congratulations, the groom clasped his hands in thanks. The bride hurriedly walked into the cabin, because she had taken off her coat during this process, and the thin white紗 wedding dress must have been cold enough for her in the cold outdoor air of December. It is said that she stayed at the Paramount Hotel last night and called a hairdresser from the Violet Beauty Salon at 3:00 AM to do her hair, which was not finished until 7:00 AM!</p>
<p>At 10:30, this "wedding plane" took off into the sky. They will hold a simple ceremony in the air to exchange rings and sign the marriage certificate. The seven air hostesses of Central Airlines also jointly presented a cake for them to distribute to the guests in the air.</p>
<p>According to the groom, they will get off the plane in Nanjing, use the Central Hotel as their temporary honeymoon suite, and return to Shanghai in two or three days, where they also plan to host a banquet at the Paramount to treat guests. The reason for getting married on the plane this time is said to be to "save" some money. The total cost is estimated to be 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>After the plane flew off, Central Airlines' Director Cai smiled and said to reporters, "We warmly welcome anyone who wants to get married on the plane!" Couples preparing to get married, what do you think of this method?</p>

<h3>Year-End Bonus for Employees Should in Principle Be One Month's Salary</h3>
<p>But Can Be Adjusted Based on the Prosperity and Decline of Various Industries</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau's Year-End Bonus Research Committee met at 3:00 PM yesterday. The committee members present were Lu Jingshi, Zhao Banfu, Shen Zhi, Li Kaidi, Fan Zhenbang, Wang Jiashu, Zhang Yongqin, Gu Zusheng, and others. During the meeting, the various opinions obtained from the previous symposium with representatives of the Industrial Association, the General Labor Union, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were summarized and discussed, and the following preliminary points were decided: The year-end bonus for this year will still be in principle one month's salary, but can be adjusted based on the prosperity and decline of various industries. Labor and management should negotiate on their own. If the negotiation fails, it will be sent to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau for processing. Everything should be processed as quickly as possible. Pieceworkers, except for temporary workers hired on an ad hoc basis who will be discussed separately, will still receive a year-end bonus. The year-end bonus method for temporary workers has not been determined. In addition, because the amount of funds required for the year-end bonus is huge, the sudden need for such a large amount of money in the market will inevitably affect the money supply, so it may be issued in installments. The above points are subject to Director Wu's return from Taiwan to Shanghai and approval by the Municipal Government with the approval of Mayor Wu before implementation.</p>

<h3>Magazine Publishers Gather to Discuss Forming an Association and Request Paper Allocation</h3>
<p>More than seventy magazine publishers in Shanghai, recognizing the past lack of connection and numerous business difficulties, and feeling increasingly burdened by the recent surge in prices, convened a meeting on the 5th. They advocated for the formation of an association, recognizing the immediate need for such an organization to achieve unified planning and cooperation for all aspects of publishing, advertising, printing, and binding, in order to facilitate the dissemination of culture. They also requested paper allocation, as the financial resources of the magazine industry are inherently weak, and without significant advertising revenue, they rely solely on distribution to make ends meet. Given the recent repeated surges in paper prices, while sales prices cannot be proportionally increased, they requested the government to promptly allocate official-price paper.</p>

<h3>Counties on the Border Between Jiangsu and Anhui Establish Joint Regional Defense</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 4th] Scattered bandits frequently disturb the border areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.

<h3>Large Number of Perpetrators Arrested in the Assassination of Li Xuelu</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Jintan, 4th] The assassination of Li Xuelu, the deputy speaker of the County Council, has caused a sensation throughout the county and has been taken very seriously by all parties. County Chief Chang has been actively investigating based on clues, and believes that Yuan Wenbin, a former member of the Provisional Council, is highly suspected. He was arrested on the 23rd in Zhixi Bridge (currently the director of the Zhixi Bridge Grain and Food Office). Subsequently, another suspect, Yang Zhengjun, was arrested, and accomplices Chen Juqing, the murderer Yuan Xiping, and another suspect, Chang Guoying, were apprehended. The murder weapon was recovered from the scene based on Yuan's confession. On the 25th, another suspect, Jing Demao (head of Shuibei Township), was arrested, and on the 26th, another suspect, Luo Zhannong (head of Shangxian District), was apprehended. County Chief Chang personally interrogated them. Except for the instigator, who vehemently denied the accusations, the other suspects confessed that Yuan Wenbin was indeed the instigator of the case. Thus, the facts of the case became clear. According to the investigation, Yuan Wenbin harbored resentment because he lost the election for County Councilor to Li Xuelu in July of this year. He used the opportunity of this general election to divert attention and frame others. Therefore, he secretly sent Yuan Xiping and Chen Yunbin to lie in wait near Li's residence that night. At approximately 9:00 PM, when Deputy Speaker Li and Instructor Tang Chengxiang returned home, the two murderers followed and opened fire, killing him instantly. Currently, the murderer Chen Yunbin is still at large. All the arrested criminals have been transferred to the court for trial. Meanwhile, the Party, government, and council are jointly organizing a funeral committee for Deputy Speaker Li to handle the aftermath.</p>

<h3>Wu Shaoyu and Others Accused of Corruption in Nantong</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nantong, 3rd] After the Yang case solved the nine-life murder case in Matang District of Rugao, it was learned that at about 7:00 PM on the 25th of last month, Wu Shaoyu, the civil affairs instructor of the district, and Cao Zhongfang, the finance instructor, committed a major corruption case. Deputy Brigade Commander Ma, the commander of the garrison in Rudong District, personally led a team to arrest them. The details of the case are as follows: A merchant named Gu from Nantong obtained a certificate of application from the county government last month and carried a large amount of money to Matang to transport more than forty fresh pigs and more than ten stones of leather flowers.

Wu Shaoyu, the civil affairs instructor, and Cao Zhongfang, the finance instructor, jointly dispatched a team to detain the people and materials separately. They tortured Gu in every possible way, forced him to confess, and ordered him to make a statement admitting that the materials belonged to bandits, and confiscated them before releasing him. Gu filed a complaint with the First District Command of the Pacification. After investigation, it was found to be true.

<h3>Explosive Detonates; Scavenger's Brain Explodes</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 4th] Chen Changfu, a 32-year-old man from Huaian who made a living by scavenging, residing at 98 Xijiawan, picked up an iron object in Qilidian the day before yesterday (30th). After returning home, he sharpened it at home on the morning of the 1st. Unexpectedly, he accidentally touched the handle, and with a loud bang, it suddenly exploded. Chen's head was blown open, his brains splattered, and both legs were severed. He died on the spot, and the five thatched houses he lived in were also destroyed. After the incident, the nearby police station sent police officers and firefighters to rescue. A neighboring woman, Wen Shen (a mute), was pressed under the house and was rescued and sent to the Christian Hospital for treatment. Her life is not in danger. According to the investigation, the exploding object was a shell, which Chen Changfu did not recognize, resulting in his tragic death. Also: On the morning of the 1st, railway police at the Zhenjiang West Station seized many boxes of matches from a soldier. Because they were contraband, the owner did not come forward to claim them. The station ordered the railway police to unload and confiscate them. Due to careless handling, the matches collided and caught fire instantly, burning the heads and limbs of railway policemen Ding Xuan, Huang Zixiang, and Teng Qixiong. They were rushed to the provincial hospital, and fortunately, they are out of danger. Because only the match heads were ignited, other places were not affected.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Flour Mill Discovers Fake Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 5th] The Suzhou Flour Mill, managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in this county, has recently been ordered to prepare for transfer to the China Grain Industry Corporation for operation. Unexpectedly, two fake warehouse receipts from the factory were suddenly discovered in the market on the 3rd. The printing was very realistic and difficult to distinguish, causing great panic among flour merchants, who rushed to send their warehouse receipts to the factory for identification. Trading that day was quiet. As of the 4th, eleven fake warehouse receipts, each for 50 bags of flour, had been discovered. It is still difficult to determine the exact number of fake receipts. To prevent the situation from escalating, the Flour Association is working with the factory to negotiate a solution, and is asking the police criminal investigation team to investigate the source of the fake receipts and strive to solve the case as soon as possible to reassure the public.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Suzhou City; One Bandit Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 5th] Since the start of winter defense in this county, it has been generally stable. Unexpectedly, a robbery occurred at Chen Zuyin's house, No. 1 Zilanzhi, in the city center this evening. Fortunately, military police patrols were tight, and one of the two bandits was arrested on the spot. A fake pistol, a pointed knife, and a small foreign knife were found on his person. Based on his confession, an informant was arrested. The police are still pursuing the remaining bandits. In addition: Banditry is rampant in the western countryside of Suzhou.

<h3>Wuxi Press Holds Public Memorial Service for Martyr Xu Yukang</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi, 4th] Xu Yukang, a reporter for the National Guidance News in this county, was excellent in character and learning and had served in the press for many years. When the Anti-Japanese War began in 1937, Wuxi fell, and Xu joined the guerrillas, fighting the enemy more than thirty times. On two special occasions, Xu was captured. On a night of wind and rain, he was tied to a tree and the enemy stabbed him in the chest and abdomen with a gun and he died. He was 26 years old. Two days later, his fellow villagers coffined him and temporarily buried him in the fields of Shitang. After the victory, Xu's friends, Xu Chizi and Li Gongwei, proposed to build a tomb. They raised funds and purchased a tomb in the Wuxi Public Cemetery in Qingshan Bay, Huishan, this spring, transported the loyal bones to the city for burial, and launched a public memorial service on the afternoon of the 4th, which was attended by more than one hundred people from the press and friends of Martyr Xu.

<h3>On the People's Right to Health: A Personal Opinion on the Constitution of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>In democratic countries, the people are the main body of the country. All constitution-making, establishment of basic policies, and various political facilities should be centered on the people, and seek welfare for the people. The biggest root cause of the Chinese people's problems is poverty, illness, ignorance, and weakness. Therefore, our constitution-making, the establishment of basic national policies, and various political facilities should be centered on these four factors.</p>
<p>I have reread the Constitution of the Republic of China of the National Assembly of December 25th last year, and I feel that of the four root causes mentioned above, only half of them are given due attention. In other words, except for relatively correct policies and clauses regarding the poverty and ignorance of the people, the articles about the diseases and weakness of the people are vague and unclear, which makes people feel that they are not comprehensive enough. Therefore, I venture to attach importance to the two items of disease and weakness, and make some supplements to the Constitution of the Republic of China passed last year, so as to solicit the opinions of the people and political experts across the country. I hope that the experts will not hesitate to give their advice.</p>
<p>The introduction to the Constitution of the Republic of China states: "The National Assembly of the Republic of China, entrusted by all the people, based on the teachings of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, in order to consolidate national sovereignty, protect civil rights, lay the foundation for social stability, and improve the welfare of the people, formulates this constitution, implements it throughout the country, and eternally follows it." My opinion is that the phrase "ensure national health" should be added after "improve the welfare of the people." Because people's welfare can certainly include national health, but merely saying "improve the welfare of the people" does not emphasize ensuring national health, which easily makes people overlook and forget that the greatest root cause of the Chinese people's problems lies in their sickness and physical weakness. The impact of this leads to an increase in the people's mortality rate and a shortening of their average lifespan, which is a great and significant loss to the future of the entire nation. If this continues, the increased mortality rate will lead to a loss in the national economy, and the shortened average lifespan will affect the establishment of many social and cultural undertakings, making the people lack the spirit of permanent struggle. All of the above are objective facts and inevitable inferences, not deliberate alarmist remarks. Therefore, ensuring national health is the most fundamental principle of nation-building and one of the most basic national policies. We should pay special attention to it when formulating the fundamental law. Therefore, I advocate that this sentence should be added to the introduction of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Article 15 of Chapter 2, "Rights and Obligations of the People," states: "The people's right to subsistence, right to work, and right to property shall be guaranteed." I believe that the three words "right to health" should be added after "right to subsistence," because the term "right to subsistence" is relatively vague. If it is said that the right to subsistence already includes the right to health, then why can't the right to work and the right to property be included in the right to subsistence? Now that the right to work and the right to property can be established as separate items outside of the right to subsistence, why can't the right to health be added again to show attention to it?</p>
<p>Secondly, in Chapter 10, "Powers of the Central and Local Governments," Article 108, "The following matters shall be legislated and executed by the Central Government, or delegated to the provinces and counties for execution," the item "Public Health" in item 18 and the item "Relief, Pensions, and Unemployment Relief" in item 19 should have item 19 "Public Medical System" added between them, and the original item 19 should be changed to 20, and so on. In Article 109, "The following matters shall be legislated and executed by the provinces, or delegated to the counties for execution," the words "public medical" should be added after the words "education, health, industry, and transportation" in the first item. The same applies to the first item in Article 110, "The following matters shall be legislated and executed by the counties."</p>
<p>Chapter 13, "Basic National Policies," is originally divided into six sections: 1. National Defense, 2. Diplomacy, 3. National Economy, 4. Social Security, 5. Education and Culture, and 6. Border Areas. The article on national health is under the fourth section, Social Security, which also shows a lack of emphasis on national health. I believe that a fifth section, namely the National Health section, should be added after the fourth section, Social Security. In addition to the original Article 157, "The State shall universally promote health care services and a public medical system to improve national health," another article should be established, stating "The State shall provide appropriate treatment opportunities for people with diseases," which is opposite to Article 155, "The State shall provide appropriate assistance and relief to the elderly, weak, disabled, and those unable to live, and those who have suffered extraordinary disasters." Moreover, only with the addition of this article can the four words "public medical system" have clear and substantial content; and the state can confirm its responsibility for the people's diseases and health because there are clear provisions in the law.</p>
<p>The above is my opinion on the provisions of the Constitution, which I hereby put forward for reference when the Constitution is implemented and amended in the future. Perhaps some people will say that Article 157 of the Constitution has already clearly stipulated that "The State shall universally promote health care services and a public medical system to improve national health." All that is proposed now is already included in this article, so why bother with so much effort and spend so much time on the articles? I say no. I believe that improving national health and promoting health care services and a public medical system are only policies. If there is no provision for the right to health in the people's rights and obligations, then the legal foundation will be lost, and the foundation will not be very solid. Therefore, my opinion is that the establishment of the people's right to health is an indispensable key point for future constitution-making, and this is not only in medical policy - such as whether to promote health care services and the public medical system.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say that the people's health is a matter for the individual, and that diseases are half man-made and half natural, and that state politics has never hindered the people's health. Isn't the so-called establishment of a right to health a forced and far-fetched argument? I say no. Previously, U.S. President Roosevelt proposed the slogan of the Four Freedoms, one of which was freedom from want. If freedom from want is to be said by individualistic economists, then the individual's want is entirely determined by the individual's diligence and frugality, and what does it have to do with the individual, let alone the right to freedom? If this is also a kind of freedom, then no one in the world can be at ease in want; what freedom is there to speak of? It is not known that in modern society, the individual's position is closely related to the social system, and the state's legislation cannot but pay attention to this. From this point of view, President Roosevelt's call was far-sighted and deeply meaningful. My intention today in advocating that the people's right to health be clearly stipulated in the Constitution is the same. Because today's science is advanced, and society is complex, not only large-scale medical research and nationwide epidemic prevention work cannot be carried out without the power of the state, but also the dissemination of people's medical knowledge and the equipment for ordinary medical work must be decided by the state as a whole, and then guided and supervised separately, so that it can be completed. If the people's right to health is established in the Constitution, then all state administration should at all times think about the health of the people, and consider ensuring the health of the people as one of the most important tasks of state administration, and at the same time, as one of the most basic rights of the people, then the realization of an ideal politics and an ideal society can be achieved. In the past, French Confucian scholars advocated human rights, saying that human rights are innate, and that everything should be free and equal, which is very true. However, it is vague, and in the implementation, there are still difficulties and obstacles, and it is impossible to achieve the ideal. Our Premier Sun Yat-sen created the Three Principles of the People, and added the principles of nationalism and people's livelihood to civil rights, because if national oppression is not eliminated, the people's economy cannot be equal, and if their lives cannot be solved, then basic human rights cannot be realized. Our country has always been known for its poverty and weakness. Although it has recently defeated powerful enemies externally, the poverty and weakness of the people have not yet been eliminated, and the so-called basic civil rights may not be established. Moreover, we have already established the right to education for saving the ignorant, and the right to property and the right to work for saving the poor. How can we not establish the right to health for saving the sick and the weak?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the basic policies of modern countries and the consistent trend are also to seek the wealth and power of the country. If the people of the whole country are all in poverty and illness, how can this country be wealthy and powerful, and reach the road to modernization? Our past failures, and the oppression of the great powers and imperialism, are also closely related to the bad reputation of the sick man of East Asia. How can the planners of the country today, and the people who implement the democratic era, not pay great attention and vigilance?</p>
<p>I usually advocate the promotion of a public medical system, but I have recently realized that to promote a public medical system and to implement health care undertakings, it must start with establishing the people's right to health. Therefore, I propose the establishment of the people's right to health, and I hope that the people and political experts across the country will pay attention to it, and I hope that it can be adopted into the Constitution when it is implemented.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to add "5. Those who have been engaged in medical and pharmaceutical undertakings for a long time and have achieved excellent results" to Article 167 of the Constitution, "The State shall reward or subsidize the following undertakings or individuals," "3. Those who have inventions in academic and technical fields," "4. Those who have been engaged in education for a long time and have achieved excellent results." Because before the public medical system has been implemented, or has not been thoroughly implemented, we should still encourage and reward private efforts. Since this is the case, why does the Constitution only pay attention to the achievements in education and academic medical research, and ignore the efforts and promotion of medical and pharmaceutical undertakings? But this is just an additional opinion. I also attach it here for reference.</p>
<h3>Travel Safety Room</h3>
<p>— Zhu Min</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, the local news column of the Central Daily News carried a report that pregnant women had given birth on the 74th train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway on the previous two days. After reading this, I had a few thoughts: 1. It is not uncommon for pregnant women to give birth or have sudden illnesses on trains. Although it is a coincidence that the same thing happened on the same train for two days, it is not something that happens every day; however, it is reasonable to say that such things can often happen! 2. Not only do pregnant women give birth on trains, but more dangerous things than childbirth can also happen at any time, such as acute infectious diseases! This is not only a matter of life and death for individuals who develop acute diseases, but also a matter of infection in the entire carriage! 3. Both of these pregnant women could not reach their destinations and had to get off the train midway. It is said that both mother and child are safe. This was the news at the time of the report. Are they healthy now? 4. Assuming that there was prior notice by letter, and they are not seen returning at the time, I am afraid that their families will be anxious. Therefore, for the sake of the health and safety of pregnant women, I suggest that our transportation department, which is actively improving railways, postal services, and telegrams, should first set up a travel safety room to solve the problems of first aid and isolation. This is really an urgent matter! The method is to set up a safety room in the middle of the train, with a simple surgical table that can reduce vibration, stretchers, first-aid equipment, and medicines, and to be responsible for a nurse who has both obstetrical knowledge and public health training. The railway authorities will not spend much, but the passengers will benefit greatly!</p>
<h3>About Vitamins (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yin Jiting</p>
<p>A noteworthy idea came in 1913. McCollum found a vitamin in a type of fat that was essential for promoting development. Thus, vitamin A came into being. Vitamin A is mostly found in fatty substances, such as cream and egg yolks. It is especially abundant in cod liver oil. In ordinary human food, as long as fat is not lacking, it is easy to obtain vitamin A, and there is no need to promote expensive cod liver oil. Vegetables such as carrots, spinach, and green peppers also contain this vitamin. A lack of vitamin A will hinder development, so it is also a vitamin that promotes development. Another characteristic is night blindness, where the eyes become blurry at night. In severe cases, dry eye disease and excessive keratinization of the skin can occur. In 1935, the American biologist Wald further proved that vitamin A and protein form the purple pigment on the retina of the eye. This purple pigment is an essential element for seeing in sunlight. This shows the importance of vitamin A to life.</p>
<p>Vitamin B was the earliest vitamin discovered. It is mostly found in the sprouts of grains, such as brown rice, barley, and wheat. Peanuts, liver, and meat have the highest content. There are many types of vitamin B. A lack of the first type of vitamin B (Thiamine) will result in beriberi. This disease is found throughout the country. Too much refining of rice and wheat flour is one of the reasons, and another is eating too little meat. This vitamin has the effect of promoting appetite, and its uses are indeed very broad. People with fever, hyperthyroidism, alcoholism, and those who do physical labor need more of the first type of vitamin B. The second type of vitamin B (Niacin) is for treating pellagra. Other than this disease, it is not necessary.</p>
<p>Scurvy has existed in Europe for a long time. Soldiers in battlefields and sailors on long voyages are particularly susceptible to it. It was not until 1912 that Holst and Frolich used animal experiments to learn about the existence of vitamins. Cabbage has the highest content, and there is also a lot in vegetables and fruits. A lack of vitamin C makes the skin and mucous membranes prone to bleeding, and there are often cases of continuous bleeding that endanger life. This is scurvy. Eating more vegetables is a simple and good way to obtain vitamin C.</p>
<p>Calcium and phosphorus are the main components that make up the bones of the body. Vitamin D can help the body absorb calcium and phosphorus. Rickets in children is the result of a lack of vitamin D during childhood development. Rickets is very common in our country and is not limited to children from poor families. The source of vitamin D is similar to that of vitamin A. Both exist in fatty substances, with egg yolk and cod liver oil containing the most. After the human body is directly exposed to sunlight, the subcutaneous tissue has the ability to self-produce vitamin D to maintain the needs of the body, so you should often see more sunlight.</p>
<p>Vitamin E has recently been discovered in silk-colored vegetables and wheat germ. A lack of this vitamin makes animals unable to reproduce. It remains to be proven whether humans can increase fertility by eating more vitamin E.</p>
<p>The discovery of vitamin K (ViamineKMenadione) has significant value in medicine. It has a curative effect on bleeding in newborns and bleeding in gastrointestinal diseases. Undoubtedly, the discovery of vitamins has brought a lot of benefits to disease prevention and health promotion, and is truly a gospel for mankind. However, the use of vitamins has a certain limit. Regardless of whether you are lacking vitamins or not, blindly using large amounts of vitamins is not only an abuse, but also a kind of so-called waste. In today's society, vitamins seem to be the only savior for malnutrition. When contacting patients, they will ask: Am I lacking vitamins? What kind of vitamin should I inject? Pharmacists are even using people's worship of vitamins to create a variety of products with clever names and false vitamin products, calling them tonic medicines, and selling them on the market to enrich their own pockets. Therefore, I don't know how many vitamins are being wasted. Look again at our villages, where beriberi, rickets, and night blindness occur, and how much vitamins are needed for treatment. It is not uncommon for people to become disabled or endanger their lives because they cannot get vitamin supplements. Our country is not really short of vitamin supply, but too much is wasted on a small number of people, and the benefits are uneven, with a huge disparity. This is really a disservice to the scientists' efforts in inventing vitamins, and is far from their original intention of benefiting the people. This is such a regrettable fact that urgently needs to be changed by our medical colleagues.</p>

<h3>The Origin of British Football (Part 1)</h3>
<p>[— Le Xiurong]</p>
<p>Although there are many legends about the origin of British football, the most credible one is that modern British football is a continuation of an ancient Roman game called Haroastum. This ancient Roman game involved selecting two teams of similar strength and drawing a line behind each team's territory. Whoever brought the ball into and crossed the opponent's line first would win. This type of competition may have been passed on to Britain by Roman soldiers. Centuries later, it was introduced to students by monks who managed schools. In 1175, schoolchildren in London played football. Tuesday was designated as Football Day, and schoolchildren all over the city went to the countryside to play this sacred football on this day. The schools attached to the three major churches in London all prepared their own footballs, and public government agencies provided balls for general children's entertainment every year.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, football matches suffered a major blow, and the authorities enacted several laws prohibiting football and other similar competitions. Historian Stubbs also protested, saying: "Football matches are more of a friendly struggle than entertainment?" By 1666, football matches were actually considered to be against the law. However, this could not separate the public's general love for football. It slowly developed into competitions between church districts and competitions between cities and villages. In several villages and towns in Northumberland and Thebeshire today, there are still such ancient customs.</p>
<p>At the end of the 18th century, this universality gradually disappeared until general public schools used various ball games as physical education entertainment, and football matches were revived. In 1860, many large schools recognized football as a winter game competition. Each school stipulated its own competition rules, so football was also played in universities, and alumni of each school also formed teams to compete. Because the competition rules of each school were inconsistent, it was quite difficult to arrange inter-school competitions, so the Cambridge University Football Club began to collect various different rules and draft a general rule that included various key points. At the same time, football clubs sprung up everywhere, and a common set of competition rules was clearly urgently needed. In October 1863, responsible representatives of major urban football clubs and people interested in football held a meeting at the Freemasons' Tavern on Great Queen Street in London. The purpose was to organize a society "to formulate a formal set of competition rules." Everyone enthusiastically participated in this meeting and decided to establish this historical British "Football Association".</p>

<h3>Adjusting Exchange Rates and Supplying Cash, the National Bank Must Plan for Both</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Economic Commission decided on the 4th that the Joint Treasury should fully plan to reduce the internal exchange rate as much as possible, facilitate internal exchange, clearly raise the Shanghai exchange rate, restrict large remittances, and the Ministry of Finance should formulate a resolution on the transportation of cash, and the National Bank should supply cash to the inland to cooperate with the case. Yesterday, the reporter visited a relevant authority of the National Bank to inquire about his opinion on this matter. It is said that the exchange rate of the National Bank's treasury is determined every Saturday by representatives of each bank's treasury at a small group meeting, based on the exchange rate situation of the past week, and the internal exchange rate of the next week is determined, and the elastic expansion of the exchange rate is made at any time according to the liquidity and tightness of funds in various places. He believes that the current expansion and contraction of the exchange rate is purely related to the supply of funds. If the funds are abundant, a large amount of exchange can be supplied, and the exchange rate will naturally be flat. Otherwise, simply raising the exchange rate to a certain place will slightly limit the transfer of funds on the one hand. However, the high exchange rate in a certain place will inevitably be passed on to the local prices, and the price level of the valley will be raised invisibly. Therefore, when adjusting the exchange rate, we must pay attention to the transportation of cash and take into account various factual environments and plan comprehensively in order to be effective.</p>

<h3>China Trust Bureau Purchases the Fourth Batch of Frozen Eggs</h3>
<p>The Export-Import Control Commission Entrusts the China Trust Bureau to Purchase a Large Batch of Frozen Eggs from Maochang Company</p>
<p>The Export-Import Control Commission has entrusted the China Trust Bureau to purchase a large batch of frozen eggs from Maochang Company for export.

The selling price in the United Kingdom is 210 pounds per ton, and the shortfall in national currency is paid by the national treasury in order to strive for exports and maintain the international market. According to Zheng Xuejun, the person in charge of Maochang, the cost is slightly insufficient due to the price index and the rise in raw materials. The raw materials for the first batch of frozen eggs were only 1.6 million yuan per market dan, but now it has reached 2 million yuan.

Regarding the allocation of American cotton to yarn factories with fewer than 3,000 spindles, the association drafted simplified rules and submitted them to the Textile Adjustment Committee for review. The Textile Adjustment Committee telegraphed back, approving the plan. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce responded to the association's statement regarding the difficulties in implementing the "method of affixing stamp tax tickets to invoices issued by manufacturers paying goods tax," stating that the matter has been forwarded to the ministry, and requesting that explicit supplementary measures be issued for cases where there is no sale, so that invoices for goods do not need to be created, in order to prevent disputes. The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee replied to the association's proposal to increase the allocation of American cotton by 611 bales, stating that the original ratio will be maintained, and all the remaining bales will be allocated to factories with fewer than 3,000 spindles, which has been requested to be handled by the head office. Important discussion items included: A telegram from the Textile Adjustment Committee instructed factories to submit daily yarn factory reports from December 1st. These reports were previously submitted daily during the cotton purchasing period for review by the association, but since cotton purchasing was suspended in April, the factories also stopped submitting the reports. The question now is how to handle this situation. It was decided that the association would wait for a form from the Textile Adjustment Committee with comprehensive content, then make modifications before sending it out to the factories for completion.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil and Bristles - Price Increases Make Export Prospects Unoptimistic</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The prices of tung oil and bristles have risen sharply in the producing areas. The costs for exporters have increased. Sellers are hesitant to sell. The loss on the bristle trade has reached as high as 30%. Unless immediate measures are taken, the export prospects are not optimistic.</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau's Barter Department released a market report for tung oil and bristles from November 24th to 29th, 1947, stating: Tung Oil: Domestic tung oil prices rose during this period due to the exchange rate changing from 64,500 to 73,000. The price increases were particularly sharp in Guangzhou and Wuzhou. The price in Chongqing was 1.4 million yuan per picul, 1.68 million yuan in Hankou, and 1.98 million yuan in Shanghai. Speculators advanced 1.86 million to a planting factory for dozens of tons, with a January shipping date, calculated at US$0.235 per pound F.O.B. Shanghai. The price would be adjusted according to the normal exchange rate. The price in Changsha was 1.7 million yuan, 1.5 million yuan in Wanxian, 2.23 million yuan in Wuzhou, and 2.336 million yuan in Guangzhou. The overseas price in New York for spot goods has been done at US$0.265 per pound. The trend is orderly. The price for shipping drum oil from overseas is US$0.26 per pound CSF. Due to increased domestic costs, the military is watching the situation. Exporting oil at the current Shanghai market price involves a loss of about 5%. Because overseas sales prices are stable, the exchange rate adjustment situation is slightly better. However, smuggling in South China is rampant, and it is hoped that the authorities will take measures to stop it. Bristles: Domestic bristle prices increased in all regions during this period. Small 55s were 51 million yuan per picul, and Chongqing black bristles were priced at 22 million, with no market. Overseas prices for Tianjin large 55s were US$6.10 per pound CSF. Small 55s were US$4, and US$3 on the 26th. The trend remains weak. Chongqing black bristles were US$1.90 or 14 shillings. Flower bristles were stable at US$1.60 or 11 shillings and 9 pence. Hankou bristles were US$2.80, with buyers hoping for a slight reduction. Shanghai bristles were US$1.70. However, these prices are about 30% below cost, and how to promote exports depends on the authorities taking measures.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of the second tranche of short-term treasury bills for 1947, a total of US$2,141,250 has been sold nationwide as of December 4th, of which US$1,324,450 was sold by national banks in this city.</p>
<p>The cigarette market was quiet yesterday, with prices falling. Ten-packs of Great Britain and Old Knife cigarettes each fell by 4-500,000 yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also fell by 500,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Daily necessities and soap prices declined yesterday. Sales were good at the shops. Fixed and Arrow soaps each dropped by around 10,000 yuan. Matches and candles were stable.</p>
<p>The fur market is active. New yellow weasel skins are selling for around 400,000 yuan per pair. Qingshan goat and sheep skins are selling for 130,000 yuan per pair. Leopard skins are 1.5 million, and cat skins are 70,000.</p>
<p>There has been a sudden increase in applications for the return and export of materials brought to the port with self-prepared foreign exchange. There are about 600 cases to date. Very few applications for purchase have been received. It is said that all plan to transfer them to imports from Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3>Linguistics and History</h3>
<p>— Ji Xianlin</p>
<p>Although linguistics and history are both independent sciences, they can help each other in many ways. We all know that history can help linguistics, because to study a language, the first step is to know the history of the people who speak that language: there is no need for us to elaborate on this. As for how linguistics can help historical research, and even solve some historical problems that can only be solved from a linguistic perspective, it seems necessary to discuss this in particular. I plan to give two examples below.</p>
<p>The first example I would like to cite is the problem of the original home of the Indo-European peoples and their subsequent migrations. These are certainly historical problems; but it was linguistics that raised and solved these problems. To describe this problem, we should first start with comparative linguistics. At the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, European scholars began to come into contact with Sanskrit. Soon they discovered that Sanskrit had many similarities with Greek and Latin. After careful research, they finally realized that the language used by the Indians, whom they had always considered to be a colored race, was originally related to their own ancient languages, and that the black-skinned Indians were originally one family with them. A brother who had separated and left thousands of years ago had now suddenly returned to the fold. This was such a great joy for the white Aryans. Therefore, a great European scholar said that the discovery of the formula Dyauspic (Sanskrit) = Zcus-pater (Greek) = Jupiter (Latin) was one of the most profound discoveries of mankind in the nineteenth century. Since they knew that Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and modern European languages all came from the same source, they continued their research based on this clue and finally reconstructed the so-called Proto-Indo-European language. This language is the ancestor of all later Indo-European languages. In this language, there is a series of velar consonants. For some unknown reason, these velar consonants later diverged. In the eastern branch of the Indo-European languages, they evolved into sibilant sounds; in the western branch, they became k kh g gh. For example, the word for "dog" is kuon in Greek and Canis in Latin, which is the western branch. In Sanskrit, it is Svan, and in Lithuanian, it is Szuo, which is the eastern branch. The word for "hundred" is Centum in Latin and Hekaton in Greek; in Avesta it is Satem, in Sanskrit it is Sata, in Lithuanian it is Szimtas, in Old Bulgarian it is Suto, and in Russian it is Sto. Scholars usually use the word Centum to represent the western branch of languages, and Satow to represent the eastern branch. Although these languages all evolved from Proto-Indo-European, they each have their own characteristics. Occasionally, there are two that are particularly close, such as the ancient Persian Avesta and Sanskrit. All of the above facts are purely derived from the study of languages. If we apply the results of this language study to history, we can get a clear picture of the migration and differentiation of the Indo-European peoples: the white people now scattered across Europe and Asia were originally one family thousands of years before Christ. They settled in a certain place on the Old World, and the population was probably not too large. Later, perhaps due to conflicts of religious opinion, or perhaps due to conflicts of political opinion, they finally separated. One branch went west, and over thousands of years, their descendants multiplied and formed many countries. One branch went northeast or southeast. On the way to the southeast, they stayed in what is now Iran for a period of time. Probably another internal conflict arose. So, one part stayed in place, and another part crossed the high mountains and rushed into India, becoming the ancestors of the present-day Indian Aryans. Anyone who reads my brief account will know how significant this fact is in world history; but this fact, which is so significant in world history, is not told to us by history, but by linguistics.</p>
<p>I mentioned above that the Proto-Indo-European people once settled in a certain place on the Old World. If we now ask, where exactly was that place? This is certainly another important historical question. Archeology, prehistory, and anthropology can all help to solve this problem; but without linguistics, other sciences can only give us a little fragmented knowledge. Only linguistics can connect these fragmented pieces of knowledge and give us a clear and concrete answer. So we still have to start with linguistics first. Let's first take a look at what words are in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language, especially the nouns for animals and plants. Animal nouns include cow, horse, sheep, dog, pig, bear, etc.; but there are no tiger, elephant, lion, donkey, or camel. Plant nouns include willow, birch, beech, etc. Since there are no tiger, elephant, or lion, it can be seen that the Proto-Indo-European people had not yet seen these animals; and thus, it can be inferred that their original home would not have been in the tropics. At the same time, because there is no word for "sea" in Proto-Indo-European, it is evident that they did not live near the sea. There is no "camel," so it can be seen that they did not live in the desert. But from these words, we still cannot pinpoint a location. Let's take another look at the plant nouns. Among these words, the most important is the word "beech"; because according to scholars' observations and research, if we draw a line from the large German city of KonigsbCrg in northern Europe southward through Kiew in Russia all the way to Odessa on the Black Sea coast, then only on the west side of this line will there be beech trees, and there will be none on the east side. So the Proto-Indo-European people's home must have been on the west side of this line. Putting all of the above together, we can say that the original home of the Indo-European people was probably in the central to northern European region, and also slightly to the east. With this knowledge given to us by linguistics as a foundation, then other scientific research in this area will have something to rely on, and the results obtained will not be boundless. So, when studying this extremely important historical problem, linguistics is the main focus, and other fields such as archeology and anthropology can only help linguistics. The problem of the original home of the Proto-Indo-European people is an extremely large problem. Although I have said a lot above, and have arrived at a seemingly definitive conclusion; but this problem is not as simple as I have said above, and that result is not yet a conclusion. Future developments still depend on the efforts of scholars. However, no matter how far the research progresses in the future, those results observed from a linguistic perspective will never be overturned, and scholars can only supplement and revise these results to bring them closer to the truth.</p>
<p>Connected to this problem is another problem, also raised by linguistics, that has not yet been solved. We mentioned above that the Indo-European language family has eastern and western branches. In the western part of the Eurasian continent, they belong to the western branch, and in the eastern part of the Eurasian continent, they belong to the eastern branch. This seems very natural and there is no problem at all. Many languages of the Indo-European language family that were known and studied by comparative linguists in the nineteenth century conformed to this division. In other words, their grammatical phenomena and geographical locations were not in conflict. But at the beginning of the twentieth century, scholars discovered several new languages in Central Asia, Tocharian was one of them. There is no doubt that these languages belong to the Indo-European language family. Geographically speaking, Tocharian should belong to the eastern branch, because the Tocharian texts were all discovered in Xinjiang, China. But the grammar of Tocharian does indeed belong to the western branch. The word for "hundred" in Tocharian is Kant, which is enough to show that Tocharian is a Centum language. Why is there a western branch of people among the eastern branch of Indo-European people? We currently have no way to answer this question. But we believe that if this problem is solved in the future, we will have a very deep understanding of world history, especially the history of the migration of the Indo-European people.</p>
<p>Another problem is also somewhat related to the Indo-European languages, and we will also discuss it here. Mr. Gang Hetai once pointed out that several words in the Chinese language seem to have some relationship with the Indo-European languages (see Mr. Hu Shih's translation of Sanskrit books and ancient Chinese sounds in the first issue of the Peking University Quarterly). For example, the word "dog" seems to be cognate with the Greek Kuon and the Latin Canis. If more of these examples are found, we might be able to prove that Chinese and the Indo-European languages come from the same source, and perhaps we can draw the Chinese and Indo-European people into one family. Although I dare not say that this is definitely possible; but I dare not say that it is definitely impossible either. I can only say that it is not possible to prove it at present. If we really want to solve this problem, we can only follow the methods of European scholars, study ancient Chinese sounds, reconstruct the Proto-Chinese language, and then compare it with the Proto-Indo-European language. This is certainly another historically very important problem. Here, we can only take one path first, which is the path of linguistics.</p>
<p>The above discusses the first example. For the second example, I would like to cite the problem of the ancient inhabitants of the Western Regions. We all know that the people who live in Central Asia and Xinjiang, China today are of Turkic origin. But who lived here before the Turkic people arrived? Although our ancient history books pay special attention to the Western Regions and devote a special chapter to the affairs of the Western Regions, it is difficult for us to get a glimpse of which race these so-called barbarians belonged to from those records. The Book of Wei's Biography of the Western Regions, under the section on the country of Gan, gave a relatively concrete description of the appearance of these barbarians: "West of Gaochang, the people of various countries all have deep eyes and high noses. Only this one country does not look very barbarian, and is quite similar to the Han Chinese." But only the four words "deep eyes and high noses" can only tell us that they are different from the "Han Chinese." White people certainly have "deep eyes and high noses," but don't the Turkic people also have them? We still cannot determine their race. Since the excavation of ancient artifacts and documents in Central Asia at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, our research basis has increased. We can see the faces of these "barbarians" in the murals; but the impression given to us is still only the four words "deep eyes and high noses." Even the skulls dug out of the ground can only tell us that before the Turkic people arrived, the people of Central Asia must have belonged to the white Indo-European people. We still cannot know which kind of white people they were. Here, only linguistics can help us answer this question.</p>
<p>Among the three newly discovered ancient Indo-European languages in Central Asia, Tocharian is an independent branch. Scholars' opinions on the question of the affiliation of the people who speak this language are still very inconsistent, and we cannot discuss it in detail here. The remaining two, Khotanese Saka and Tumshuqese, have been studied by scholars and recognized as belonging to the Iranian language family of the Indo-European language family. Therefore, the people who speak these languages probably also belong to the Iranian ethnic group. Now let's go back to the question we raised above: before the arrival of the Turkic people in the ancient Western Regions, what kind of people lived there? We can answer that at least a large part of them were Iranian people.</p>
<p>The above discusses the second example. Of course, there are many more examples that can be cited; but these two are enough to show how linguistics can help historical research. Some of what I said above is just old news; but why did I especially mention that linguistics and many sciences can serve as auxiliary sciences for history; but linguistics does not seem to have been valued enough. I especially bring it up just to call everyone's attention. In addition, I also feel that many purely linguistic scholars limit the scope of their research to language alone and do not take a step outward. I also think this is a pity. Of course, not every conclusion of linguistic research can be applied to history; but at least some can, and the results obtained by applying linguistic conclusions to history are mostly very reliable. In order to make linguists pay attention, I wrote this short article. (November 29, 1947, Peking University)</p>
<h3>A Study of the Stone Drum Inscriptions Carved in the Third Year of Duke Ling of Qin</h3>
<p>— Tang Lan</p>
<p>(The Stone Drum Inscriptions are a type of Qin stone carving. For convenience, the old name is temporarily retained.)</p>
<p>The Stone Drums are the most prominent ancient artifacts among extant bronze and stone inscriptions. Since their discovery in the Sui dynasty, there have been inscriptions, debates, textual criticisms, and rubbings, totaling at least more than a thousand instances that I am aware of. The era they belong to is itself a subject of much debate. Upon their initial discovery, Su Xu made an inscription, roughly surmising that the script resembled the Great Seal script, and thus concluded that it was written by Shi Zhou. He stated:</p>
<p>"The world generally believes that the earliest extant calligraphy is that of Li Si. Little do they know that the traces of Shi Zhou are close at hand in Guanzhong."</p>
<p>Because Shi Zhou was said to be the Grand Scribe of King Xuan of Zhou, and the syntax of the Stone Drum Inscription's phrase "My chariots are well-made" ("沔車旣工") matches the "Carriages of War" ("車攻") section in the Three Hundred Poems, which is attributed to King Xuan, poets like Wei Huaiwu and Han Yu, and calligraphers like Li Sizzhen and Xu Hao, all believed it was created during the reign of King Zhou.</p>
<p>Ouyang Xiu was the first to doubt this theory, saying that from the first year of the Gonghe Era to the eighth year of Jiayou, there were 1914 years. The drum inscriptions are fine and shallow, how could they have survived? He also noted that scholars with a fondness for antiquities since the Han dynasty had made no mention of them, and that the Sui dynasty had the largest collection of books, yet none contained the Stone Drums. However, he also said, "The calligraphy could not have been done by anyone other than Shi Zhou," because he was unaware that the Stone Drums were discovered during the Sui dynasty. Dong You's "Guangchuan Inscriptions," and Cheng Dayou's "Yonglu" also claimed that they were made during the reign of King Cheng, their only basis being the "Cheng had a hunt at Qiyang" mentioned in the fourth year of Duke Zhao in the "Zuo Zhuan."</p>
<p>Zhai Qinian in "Stone History" said:</p>
<p>"When writing seal script, the brush should proceed where it should proceed and stop where it should stop. Now, the positioning is cramped and awkward, with some strokes shortened and others lengthened in an effort to achieve balance, as with the characters 'Liu', 'Bo', 'Jun', and 'Shu'. The meaning is fully expressed, yet the brush continues, as with the character 'Ke'. The Ten Drums are roughly similar; I will give one example. Those responsible should understand this themselves. Compare the character 'Wei' on bronze vessels with the 'Wei' in 'He Wei Wei Li' on the Stone Drum inscription, and it will become clear. The calligraphy lacks the pure, ancient air of the Three Dynasties. That is why I say this… Regarding this script, I directly say it is not the work of Shi Zhou."</p>
<p>Zhai viewed the Stone Drums with the perspective of examining bronze tripods. This argument is very correct, but he did not point out what era they should belong to.</p>
<p>Zheng Qiao used the script to prove the Stone Drums were in Qin seal script. Because the inscription contains "Successor King" ('嗣王'), he placed it after Huiwen and before the First Emperor. He probably didn't believe that King Yan was a King of Qin, so he dated it after Duke Xiang and before Duke Xian.</p>
<p>However, based on the opinion of the Jin person Ma Dingguo as conveyed through Wen Yanwei's biography, it was believed to be the work of Emperor Wen of the Later Zhou Dynasty, because Emperor Wen of the Western Wei had a hunting excursion in Qiyang in the eleventh year of the Datong reign. Most Qing dynasty scholars used the King Xuan of Zhou theory, but some argued for the Later Zhou. There were also those who were curious, like Wu Yi, who said it was made during the Han Dynasty, and Wang Fuyun, who said it was made during the Jin Dynasty. Yu Zhengbian, because Li Biao's memorial contained the phrase "Sacrificial fields in Qiyang," believed it was made in the seventh year of the Taiping Zhenjun reign of the Northern Wei, and Yao Darong said it was made by Cui Hao.</p>
<p>Based on the comparison of scripts, modern scholars have generally realized that it could not have been from the Western Zhou, and definitely not after the Han Dynasty. Everyone believes it is a Qin stone carving. However, there are still disputes about the exact period. Zheng Qiao's date is wrong, and Gong Feng's is too long. Zhen Jun and Luo Zhenyu directly set it as the time when Duke Wen of Qin hunted in the east. Ma Heng, based on the Qin Gong Gui, speculated that it should be during the time of Duke Mu. Guo Moruo argued that it was Duke Xiang, and Ma Xulun still believed it was Duke Wen. The two had argued about this. Recently, having seen Xu Zhuang's "Stone Drum Inscription Compilation," he also advocated for Duke Wen of Qin.</p>
<p>Apart from Zheng Qiao and Gong Feng, modern scholars advocate: Duke Xiang, Duke Wen, and Duke Mu. These periods are all before the mid-Spring and Autumn period (Duke Mu died in 621 BC). I think the dating is wrong.</p>
<p>From the literary style, these ten poems had no influence on the Three Hundred Poems. "My chariots are well-made" is obviously copied from the "Carriages of War" section in the Book of Songs. From the calligraphy, this square, upright, and restrained script, with particularly large characters, is completely different from general bronze inscriptions, and even more different from the Qin Gong Gui. I should agree with Zhai Qinian's statement: "Lacking the pure, ancient air of the Three Dynasties." The main reason why Ma Dingguo and others suspected it was a work from after the Han Dynasty was that they felt it wasn't ancient enough, so they wanted to place it later. We should also consider this intuitive statement.</p>
<p>The most important method is to look at the script used to determine its era. Zheng Qiao knew it was a Qin stone carving because of the characters "Yi" (殹) and "Zheng" (烝). Ma Heng used twelve types of scripts to prove it. This is an unbreakable line of reasoning. However, neither of them paid attention to its historical era. Zheng Qiao determined that it was after King Huiwen because of the two characters "Successor King." In fact, the Successor King was still the Zhou Son of Heaven, so his statement is fundamentally flawed. Modern scholars place it in the era of Duke Wen, Duke Xiang, or Duke Mu, but they completely fail to pay attention to the following issues in the script.</p>
<p>The first-person pronouns used in the Qin Gong Gui and Qin Gong Zhong are only "Zhen" (朕) and "Yu" (余). The character "Zhen" is used in the possessive case, and the character "Yu" is used in the subjective case.</p>
<p>The Stone Drum Inscriptions use the character "Yu" in two places, the character "Wo" (我) in two places, and the character "Wu" (吾) in eleven places. The character "Wu" is used in both the subjective and possessive cases, with the possessive case being more common. There is no character "Zhen." (To be continued in the next issue)</p>
<h3>A Letter on "Jueju"</h3>
<p>— Hu Shi</p>
<p>Brother Pingbo:</p>
<p>Thank you for sending me your poems to read.</p>
<p>Jueju are the most difficult to write. But this "small poem" style is quite suitable for writing about a small topic, so I think this form will definitely continue to be used by people in the future. But jueju originally came from southern folk songs, and when they reach the hands of scholars, they often become stale. If jueju can be preserved in the future, it must be closer to folk songs, sweeping away clichés and expressing a fresh artistic conception or impression with the cleanest language - only in this way can it have new life.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Fei Ming especially praised this jueju by Li Yishan:</p>
<p>Candlelight deep behind the mica screen,</p>
<p>The Long River gradually sinking, stars submerged.</p>
<p>Chang'e must regret stealing the elixir,</p>
<p>Blue sea and sky, nightly heartache.</p>
<p>That day, Ms. Yu Dawei asked me to write a plaque and also recommended this poem. I feel that this poem is not a very good jueju; it has a bit of meaning, but it is not expressed very clearly. I asked several friends to try to translate this poem into English, and they said that the first seven characters are difficult to translate because "deep candlelight" can have many meanings. As for the last two lines, they seem easy to understand at first reading, but after careful thought, they are difficult to translate into colloquial or foreign languages.</p>
<p>Such jueju are already far removed from folk songs.</p>
<p>An example of what I mean by jueju close to folk songs:</p>
<p>Green willows, green, the river smooth and calm,</p>
<p>I hear my lover singing on the river.</p>
<p>The sun rises in the east, rain in the west,</p>
<p>They say there's no sunshine, but there is.</p>
<p>This is a folk song, perhaps slightly modified by Liu Mengde, but the flavor of folk songs is still completely present. Another example:</p>
<p>From afar, I know the osmanthus in heaven is lonely,</p>
<p>I ask Chang'e if she needs anything more.</p>
<p>Luckily, there's idle land in the moon palace,</p>
<p>Why not plant two trees in the center?</p>
<p>Of course, Xiangshan's poem has underlying meaning, but this style is still very much like a folk song. I think this jueju is much better than Xiangshan's. (Bai Xiangshan himself also liked this poem very much; later he had a poem "Listening to the Song of Osmanthus," indicating that this poem was quite popular at the time and became a song.)</p>
<p>Scholars obtained the jueju form from folk songs, added new insights, more profound observations, and richer content, so the jueju of poets often have new realms, realms that folk songs cannot easily reach or cannot reach. Du Fu's "Random Thoughts" is the best example:</p>
<p>The peaches and plums I planted are not masterless,</p>
<p>The old man's low wall is still home.</p>
<p>It seems that the spring wind is teasing us,</p>
<p>Last night, it blew down several branches of flowers!</p>
<p>The willows swaying gently outside the door,</p>
<p>Are like the waist of a fifteen-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Who says the morning breeze is unintentional?</p>
<p>The wild wind breaks the longest branch!</p>
<p>These are realms that are rare or absent in folk songs. But the language here is still the most simple and clean vernacular, not relying on allusions, not flaunting diction. The artistic conception surpasses folk songs, but the language is still the language of folk songs.</p>
<p>The best jueju masters are Du Fu in the past and Yang Chengzhai in the future. Next are Wang Jinggong, Liu Mengde, and Du Mu. Such a small poem of twenty-eight characters, with so few writers in a thousand years!</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, I wanted to select "One Jueju Poem a Day," to pick out 365 jueju poems. This matter is still shelved. I've only written a dozen or so, with seven-character jueju being the vast majority. In the future, I want to select some five-character folk songs from ancient folk songs, such as "Ziye Song," and then select some seven-character folk songs from the southern folk songs that have appeared in recent years. Added to the five and seven-character jueju written by poets over the past thousand years, perhaps there can be 365 poems.</p>
<p>There are very few truly good five-character jueju written by poets. I like Du Fu's the most:</p>
<p>Don't say that spring is good.</p>
<p>The mad wind is good at mischief,</p>
<p>Blowing flowers away with the water,</p>
<p>Overturning the fishing boat.</p>
<p>I also like Yuan Tong's poem:</p>
<p>Returning drunk from the village at dusk,</p>
<p>Stumbling three, four, five times.</p>
<p>Rubbing against the green moss,</p>
<p>Don't startle you.</p>
<p>I also like a poem by Fang Weng:</p>
<p>Rising water enters my hut,</p>
<p>Duckweed sticks to half the door.</p>
<p>The sun comes out and the water recedes,</p>
<p>I wonder how you will return.</p>
<p>These artistic conceptions are all absent from folk songs. If you remember any particularly beloved jueju, please write some to me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shizhi</p>

<h3>"The Way of Former Heaven"</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>Reading the Wuxi correspondence in the 4th of the month's Shen Bao, Wuxi recently uncovered the so-called "Way of Former Heaven" organization. The ringleader has been arrested and interrogated by the police and has "directly admitted to being the head of the Way of Former Heaven without demur." According to the report obtained by the police, the old Taoist who headed this organization usually engaged in "false and misleading statements to confuse the public, as well as instigating robbery and other illegal activities."</p>
<p>Of course, we may read this news with the same attitude as reading "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple"; however, from another perspective, it is impossible not to recognize that this matter is quite serious.</p>
<p>First, this type of organization has been strictly prohibited by repeated orders, so how can it still exist in secret? The so-called "false and misleading statements to confuse the public" may just be the "invulnerability to swords and spears" spiel, nothing more than a kind of propaganda strategy for this type of organization. What is truly worth noting is the latent power that maintains these followers. Given the practical nature of Chinese farmers in all matters, this latent power must be related to their real lives. Looking at the original news cited above, isn't there also the more important "instigating robbery and other illegal activities" in addition to "false and misleading statements to confuse the public"?</p>
<p>All of the "Way of Former Heaven," "Yiguandao," as well as the old "White Lotus Sect," and "Boxer Rebellion," etc., all grew up in rural areas. Education is undeveloped, so even today there are "ignorant men and women" everywhere. Children's elementary textbooks are full of gods and demons, and theater advertisements often show "zombies worshipping the moon." The general state of mind seems to maintain only an extremely fragile balance, so "false statements" arise and the "public" is "confused," even in Wuxi, a major city on the most prosperous Beijing-Shanghai line, the "Way of Former Heaven" has occurred. Mr. Hu Shi was already urging Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy to come to China during the May Fourth era. Who knew that after more than thirty years, there would still be so many "ignorant men and women"!</p>
<p>However, has the state of the rural economy today indirectly stimulated the growth of these secret organizations? It is true that those who talk about fundamental solutions every day are deemed pedantic; however, treating a headache when it hurts and treating a foot when it hurts, while convenient for newspaper report deadlines, is ultimately not a way to deal with social problems.</p>
<h3>American Magazines</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>Although England and America share the same language and similar origins, their expressions in general culture are not entirely the same, and sometimes differ greatly. For example, when it comes to the publishing culture of the two countries, there are too many differences. Early American culture was of course derived from its mother country's culture, but as America gradually established its own domain in production and economy, the living culture of the American people gradually became unique. Although the history of the founding of the United States is still short, we cannot deny today that the United States also has its own unique national culture.</p>
<p>The style and characteristics of American magazines are a unique expression of American national culture.</p>
<p>Speaking of magazine-type publications, we must attribute the credit for constituting a major force in publishing culture to the United States. Although the origins of magazine-type publications can be traced back to ancient publishing methods such as gazettes, newspapers, pamphlets, and collections, their appearance in a brand-new form and widespread popularity is only a matter of the last two or three decades. And after the First World War, with its strong material resources and financial resources, as well as the result of universal national education, a large number of new types of magazines emerged in the United States.</p>
<p>Today, there is probably no disaster in saying that American magazines occupy the throne of the world's publishing industry, and their great influence on world culture (whether good or bad is another matter) is also undeniable. Although the number of people who read American novels and study American academia may not be so high, there are probably very few who can read English and have not read one or two American magazines.</p>
<p>Precisely for this reason, we must have a considerable understanding of the situation in the American magazine world.</p>
<p>America is a so-called American-style democratic country, and this is reflected in the American magazine world in its broadness of thought. However, I only want to introduce its classification by nature here.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, American magazines can be divided into the following categories in terms of their nature:</p>
<p>Pulp magazines—This type of magazine accounts for the largest number of American magazines. The content is mainly detective novels, adventure stories, science fiction, love stories, and popular historical romances, etc. During wartime, many war novels or interesting front-line features are naturally added. These magazines have rich illustrations, but the price is very low, and there is nothing to say about literary standards.</p>
<p>Slicks—"Slick" refers not only to the content, but also to its binding and illustrations. Like "The Saturday Evening Post" (now slightly changed), "Women's Home Companion," "American Magazine," "The Family Friend," and the slightly higher-end "Cosmopolitan," etc. These magazines are finely printed, and each issue publishes many short and long stories, features, etc. They are magazines exclusively for middle-class housewives and young ladies to enjoy, and there are specialized writers for them. In terms of literary standards, they belong to the second and third rate.</p>
<p>Almost all of the above two types of publications are sold domestically, and they are not often seen abroad, because most of the readers are Americans.</p>
<p>Quality magazines—These are mostly academic and literary publications. Like "Fortune," "Harper's," "Yale Review," "Atlantic," "The Literary Review," "The Forum," etc. In addition, there are more local publications such as "The Southern Review" (founded in 1935), New Directions (a literary quarterly specially for a small number of high-end readers), etc.</p>
<p>Miscellany—The characteristics of this type of magazine include current affairs, political commentary, various opinions, book reviews, character introductions, features, and other multi-faceted content, such as "Time," "Newsweek," "The Nation," "The New Republic," etc., which we all know. Even "Life" magazine and "Reader's Digest" can be included in this category. This type of publication is the most influential American publication abroad.</p>
<p>Aristocratic magazines—Although the name "aristocratic magazine" is fictitious, magazines like "Esquire," "Coronet," and "Pic" are high-end, tasteful magazines, judging by their content and exquisite illustrations. There is really no other way to name them except to say that they are American aristocratic magazines. It is likely that most of their readers are middle- and upper-class people.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief introduction. In addition, there are countless magazines on film, entertainment, humorous comic strips, fashion, gardening, etc. Due to space limitations, I can only omit them for the time being.</p>
<h3>Hair Standing on End in Anger</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>In idioms, there is the phrase "hair standing on end in anger." Is there really such a thing? Can our hair really stand up?</p>
<p>According to the explanation of physiologists, it is like this: extreme states of intense emotion (high degrees of fear and anger can cause this type of state) can cause the cells directly under the skin to suddenly contract strongly, causing our hair to stretch out in a straight line. At these times, our sweat hairs stand up straight. As for the reaction in the hair, although it is very weak, it can still be barely said to fully describe the high degree of anger.</p>
<p>In other cases, like when two roosters are fighting, the neck feathers stand up straight; when two dogs are fighting, the neck hairs also stand up straight. This is also due to anger. When the anger subsides, the standing hairs will return to normal.</p>
<h3>Seals and Signatures</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Among the ancients, those who used a long number of characters on their seals, apart from using seven-character poetic lines, etc., had more than seven characters, and now there are several people: eight characters, such as Yang Tieya of the Qing Dynasty's "Lake, Mountain, Wind, and Moon, Seal of a Fortunate Person," and Tang Liuru of the Ming Dynasty's "First Romantic Talent South of the Yangtze River"; nine characters, such as Xiang Kongzhang of the Ming Dynasty's "I Am Not as Good as Others, Others Are Also Not as Good as Me"; ten characters, such as Li Zhongshi of the Yuan Dynasty's "Seal of Li Qi, Master of Zhongbao's Restful Studio"; twelve characters, such as Zheng Banqiao of the Qing Dynasty's "Kangxi Graduate, Yongzheng Graduate, Qianlong Jinshi"; fourteen characters, such as Sun Chendong of the Qing Dynasty's "As for His Person, Bald, Broad Forehead, Many White Eyes"; and Xiang Kongzhang had as many as sixteen characters: "Adorning is Sufficient for Divine Principles, Drenching Exhausts the Feelings of Things, Self-Evaluation of Xiang Bozi, etc." As for those with the most self-given names, there are two people: one is Xiang Shengmo of the Ming Dynasty, whose given name was Kongzhang, and style name was Yi'an, also known as Bozi, Daxi, and Old Man of Guxu Mountain, a total of six. One is Jin Nong of the Qing Dynasty, whose given name was Shou, who styled himself Mr. Dongxin, Min of Jiliu Mountain, Unofficial Historian of Qujiang, Resident of Xixie, Taoist Guest of Longdu, Wealthy Old Man of One Hundred Twenty Inkstones, and Monk of the Hut of the Heart Coming Home, a total of eight.</p>
<h3>Thermos</h3>
<p>The inside is very hot, but the outside is ice-cold, not expressing itself, so its heat can be maintained.</p>
<p>It was blown down by the ruthless wind, mixed in the soil, but it provides nutrients for the sprouting of new leaves in the coming spring.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Smiles</h3>
<p>Housewife: "Look at the dust on the shelf, it's been accumulating for at least six weeks."</p>
<p>Servant: "That has nothing to do with me, I haven't been here for four weeks yet."</p>
<p>A Greek painter painted a picture of a child holding a basket of grapes, so lifelike that even the birds would come to peck at the grapes. Everyone said it was good, but the painter was still not satisfied. He said: "The child didn't scare the birds away."</p>
<h3>Random Notes of Someone Peeping in the Pavilion With Rats: The Great Prince Who Is Still Not Dead</h3>
<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>The Western Empress Dowager, as a woman, was "bold and suspicious." She regarded deposing an emperor and establishing an emperor as child's play. Her scheming and planning were so skilled that even the writing of past worthies still cannot attain that level. Her relationship with Guangxu had already broken down beyond repair before the Boxer Rebellion. In January of the 26th year of Guangxu, she formally announced that Puyi, the son of Prince Duan, Zaiyi, would be the Great Prince, stating that he would succeed Tongzhi. In reality, she was storing him as a preparation to depose and replace Guangxu.</p>
<p>Examining the genealogies of the Manchu Qing imperial family, Zaiyi was the second son of Prince Gong Yixin. Prince Dun had previously been adopted out to the third younger brother of Daoguang. Therefore, in terms of the strict requirements of "imperial succession," Zaiyi already did not belong to the line of Daoguang. When the Western Empress Dowager expressed her dislike of Guangxu and wanted to establish another heir for Tongzhi, there were many imperial children who competed with each other with their arms. According to Duke Fu's "Double Record of the Gengzi Year," Puyi and Pudong, the great-grandsons of Daoguang's eldest son, were the most fiercely competitive. Pudong, that is, the Red Bean Hall Master, was regarded as a Qing luminary and was once imprisoned for treason. In the end, the plan to depose and establish an heir was completely based on the Western Empress Dowager's personal grievances and affections. Only then did she temporarily elevate Zaiyi and others to bolster her position. In the end, she disregarded this genealogical system and resolutely selected Pujun as the Great Prince. This occurred in 1899 AD, and Pujun was only fifteen years old, fierce, rude, and ignorant of human affairs. The first thing he did after being established was to send palace servants to the Zhengyang Gate to buy a pony to bring back.</p>
<p>When the uprising failed, the violent group led by Zaiyi completely collapsed. The Western Empress Dowager was already taking Guangxu far away to Xi'an. In order to seek peace, Zaiyi was bound to be punished, and Pujun's title of Great Prince was also revoked at the same time with a public edict. This year, Yu Shou went to Beiping and heard people say that Pujun is still alive, now 64 years old, with both eyes completely blind. His livelihood is impoverished, and he only lives by relying on a certain Mongolian prince's mansion on the edge of Shichahai. When guests talk to him about things from fifty years ago, he stretches his neck and cries out, saying that the Empress Dowager treated me with kindness as heavy as the mountains and peaks.</p>
<p>Most of the so-called close branches of the Manchu Qing imperial family have become impoverished and defeated in the turmoil of the 30 years of the Republic of China, because they do not engage in production and are extravagant. After the head of state visited the old capital after the war, he wanted to find virtuous Manchu people to employ, in order to show the harmony of the five races. Aside from Zai Feng, the other sons of Prince Chun, Zai Xun and Zai Tao, all seem to be still alive, but they have not shed their bad habits of being dissolute wastrels, and stubbornly refuse to accept orders. Only Pu Ru, the second grandson of Prince Gong, was able to become a senator. Ru's given name was Xinyu, and he was skilled in painting, and was as famous as the carpenter Bai Shi, Qi Baishi.</p>

<h3>Poems on Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>The Little Spring October of the old calendar is about to pass. Thinking of the ancient people's lines, "The plum blossoms open first in October," I was reminded of Zhang Shuo's "purple calyx" village plums, Du Fu's "fragrant road" wild plums, and Lu You's "casually opened" garden plums. The elegant mood of chrysanthemum viewing in Fuxing Park last month unconsciously turned to the plum blossoms with "cold fragrance suspected to be in the bones."</p>
<p>Coincidentally, an old friend whom I had not seen for many years solemnly brought a fan surface on which words had already been written, asking me to casually paint some flowers. Not knowing my limitations, I casually picked up a brush and drew plum blossoms. Before I applied the brush, I thought this was a seasonal work inspired by elegant sentiments. Who knew that this fan surface was old and dull. Once the brush touched it, whether it was light ink or burnt ink, it all produced a decomposition effect. The plum blossoms on the fan surface showed an oily sheen, forming fluid droplets. I'm afraid no one would be interested in appreciating this blurry fan of plum blossoms!</p>
<p>"What should I do? I have no explanation for my old friend whom I have not seen for a long time who solemnly asked me to paint!" I thought about it for a while and came up with a way to cover up my mistake—wipe off the oil sheen in the upper left corner of the fan and inscribe a seven-character quatrain. The poem is like this:</p>
<p>"Bald brush dipped in ink on the fan,</p>
<p>Subtle fragrance floats in oily ink,</p>
<p>And take the meaning of clear snow and harmony,</p>
<p>Entrust it to the plum branches, dotting and flowing."</p>
<p>It is not necessarily that there is painting in poetry or poetry in painting, but viewed literally, it can barely be self-justified. Undoubtedly, this is relatively more satisfactory.</p>
<p>The painting manuals say that there are ten types of plum blossoms: withered plum, new plum, luxuriant plum, sparse plum, mountain plum, wild plum, river plum, garden plum, palace plum, and coiled plum. The painting methods are different, and there is a five-character quatrain to explain: "Ten kinds of plum blossoms, must rely on the ink color to distinguish, do not let them be indistinguishable, write them as the same spring." I am ashamed! The plum blossoms I painted on the fan are not among these ten types of plum trees. The ink color is oily and indistinguishable, and the snow plums are mixed as the same spring. Then I can only say that it is an accidental self-creation with a unique style.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Two: A Gentle Chat (6)</p>
<p>After a good while, Qi Wan finally came in from outside, wrinkling her shoulders and saying, "Being called to go at this hour is such a bother." As she spoke, she sat on the sofa, tilted her head back, and stared blankly at the small electric light hanging in the middle of the room. After another moment, she resolutely called Wang Ma in and instructed, "If Director Lin calls again, tell him I've gone to see the old master at number eighteen." Wang Ma smiled and nodded, then left.</p>
<p>Zhu Qi was about to ask who this Director Lin was when Qi Wan chuckled and said, "It's rare you've come today, so I had to tell him a little white lie and not go. Mr. Xu, weren't you just asking about my learning opera? I followed my mother to Shanghai when I was ten. My mother knew many friends at the Shanghai Film Company and sometimes made guest appearances on the screen. At that time, there was a Mingming Film Company, which had an affiliated Mingming Singing Troupe. Any family members of people in the film industry could participate in learning to dance and sing. I could already hum a few tunes back then, and everyone in the troupe said I was willing to learn opera and probably had some potential, so my mother hired Mr. Lu Guiyu to come to our house every day to teach me opera. The first opera I learned was "The Universe Peak." The whole opera, including the gestures and singing, took me two full months to learn before the teacher thought there was nothing inappropriate. After that, Mr. Lu taught me a few other pieces, bit by bit, and I made a few guest appearances on stage. The results were not bad. I really wanted to stay in Shanghai with my mother and learn a few more old operas, but my father kept urging me to go back in letter after letter, so I had to return to Beiping. Because my father came from a scholarly family, he didn't want his daughter to learn opera. Although I begged my father several times, he just wouldn't agree. Later, I went to a missionary school in Beiping. It wasn't until I was sixteen that my father signed a contract with a Shanghai theater, and I went to Shanghai with him. At that time, my father was working with Mr. Zhao Shunming, who was my father's best friend, and whom he trusted the most. He had seen me a few times and strongly advocated that I learn opera, letting me develop freely. My father was finally moved and said that after returning to Beiping, he would hire a famous teacher to give me advanced training. After my father's contract with the theater expired, we returned to Beiping, and the old man finally allowed me to openly learn opera. First, I studied with the famous martial arts actress, Mr. Yan Nanfeng, for a few months. I finally got a grasp of the physical movements and singing, but unfortunately, Mr. Yan passed away. Because Mr. Yan and Mr. Zhu Lanfen were relatives, after Mr. Yan's death, Mrs. Yan introduced me to Mr. Zhu Lanfen, and I formally became his student. Teacher Zhu was very cautious and serious. When teaching students, he never allowed himself to be sloppy or misleading. The first opera he taught me was "Farewell My Concubine." Because he himself had a background in martial arts, although he had followed Mr. Mei for many years, he was very clear about Mr. Mei's movements. As for the Mei school's singing style, he still didn't quite understand it, so he specially introduced me to Mr. Xu Guifen to teach me opera. Because both Mr. Zhu and Mr. Xu were very enthusiastic about me, my father specially invited them to a restaurant and repeatedly entrusted them with my cultivation. That's why I didn't find it difficult to learn the first Mei school opera, "Farewell My Concubine," and I learned it all in just a few days."</p>
<h3>"National Porcelain" and "Old Capital"</h3>
<p>Since the victory, it is said that the government plans to order Jingdezhen, Jiangxi to set up commemorative porcelain, named "Victory Kiln." It was also heard that at the wedding of Princess Elizabeth of England, the 175 pieces of fine porcelain given by our head of state were exhibited in the hall, and representatives from various countries praised them in unison, regarding them as unprecedented works of art. The above news may give the people of the country a great deal of interest.</p>
<p>China's famous products, the world knows "silk, tea, porcelain" as the three major categories, especially porcelain as the representative of Chinese crafts. Our country's science lags behind, and manufacturing cannot catch up with imported goods, resulting in a very large trade deficit. Only in the porcelain industry has it been sold abroad for more than a hundred years, which can slightly make up for it. The word "China" contains both the meanings of "China" and "Porcelain," so how can the relationship not be important?</p>
<p>Jiangxi Jingdezhen is the most famous porcelain producer in the country. In the former Qing Dynasty, the Jiujiang Daotai concurrently served as the kiln supervisor, promoting it with all his might. Therefore, the porcelain produced by the famous kilns in the town can be roughly divided into three grades: imperial porcelain, official porcelain, and commercial goods. The imperial porcelain was sometimes made with precious stones and colors from the palace treasury, which were issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Beijing. After it was made, if it was slightly unsuitable or not very refined, it was ordered to be remade, so the imperial porcelain was exquisitely made. Next, the official kilns were also characterized by strict regulations, and the commercial goods, although they were ordinary commodities, were also superior to those made elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, every new emperor who ascended the throne would first order the production of era-specific fine porcelain, and each time it could represent the style of an era. Such as Kangxi's three-color, Yongzheng's blue and white, Qianlong's bean color and sacrificial blue, Jiaqing's five-color, Daoguang's painted figures, etc., all have characteristics. As for Lao Yuan's "Hongxian" emperor, although he only reigned for eighty-three days, the Hongxian porcelain was made with materials from the imperial palace, so the manufacturing was almost as fine as that of Qianlong and Jiaqing. Moreover, because the "Yuan Emperor" period was short and the output was small, rare things are precious, so although porcelain production was in modern times, its value even exceeded that of Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu. Lao Yuan had this masterpiece, which did not betray the "ninety-five" position.</p>
<p>There are many porcelain products in Hebei, including Cizhou products and Tangshan products. Those that are slightly finer invariably bear the mark of Jiangxi. There are porcelain shops in each city of Beiping, the largest of which are Detai on Qianwai Street, Hengfa on Dongsi Pailou, and Demao on Xisi Pailou, all of which are large in scale and rich in goods. Their goods are divided into two types: locally made goods and merchandise from other places. Locally made goods are made by local craftsmen, and the methods are also modeled after Jiangxi. For merchandise from other places, people are sent to Jiangxi Province on a regular basis to purchase them.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, "Jiangxi Porcelain Industry Company" began operations in the old capital, and the local stores that had always flaunted Jiangxi could not help but pale in comparison. "Jiangxi Porcelain Industry Company" was located at the intersection of Dong'an Market and on the upper floor of Qianmenwai's Quanye Market. The exquisite products were indeed the best in the industry, but the high prices were also staggering. Most of its products are artistic, such as plates, cups, bowls, and pots. Before they are sold, wooden frames and brocade boxes are made to install glass windows, which is actually a disguised "antique shop," so the prices are extremely high and they are becoming more and more distant from the daily lives of the public. During the Beiyang government period, its sales channels were mainly the decorations of aristocratic families, the treasures of elegant guests, and antique shops that purchased its imitation products, added forgeries, and sold them as antiques.</p>
<p>Since Nanjing was designated as the capital in the 17th year of the Republic of China, and Beiping was changed to a city, general commerce has seen a decline, and the porcelain industry has been particularly affected, but it has lasted for ten years. Until the sudden outbreak of the Japanese invasion in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the old capital fell, and the market conditions were unprecedentedly desolate. The antique porcelain imitated by Japanese goods also invaded this industry, so the two branch stores of the company in the East City and Qianmenwai closed one after another, and the local large porcelain shops such as Hengfa also closed down one after another, leaving only second- and third-rate porcelain and iron shops.</p>
<p>From then until the present after the recovery, the porcelain products sold on the market are extremely complex, including Jiangxi porcelain inventory left by large porcelain factories, Oriental porcelain sold in large quantities by Japanese merchants and Japanese residents before they left, and Cizhou porcelain, Tangshan porcelain, and Xishan porcelain produced near Hebei Province. Among them, Jiangxi porcelain "company products" are still displayed in antique stalls or high-end department stores. The prices of large porcelain shops are slightly higher, and merchants speculate, creating news, saying that the Jiangxi porcelain kilns have been completely destroyed by the war, so the inventory will all become treasures.</p>
<p>Reading the Nanjin news, it is heartening to know that the Jingdezhen kiln factory, although affected by the war, has not been completely destroyed. As for how to revitalize it, I think the sages and gentlemen in Nanzhong and the officials in power will have good strategies. The reporter is in a remote location, and can only wait and see.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Interpretation: Intention to Seize a New Contract, Old Contract, Brewing Disputes</h3>
<p>Wang Jingyan asked: A friend of mine mortgaged two shops to someone named Jia in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, with a term of seven years. In the nineteenth year, the house was destroyed by fire. Jia invested in rebuilding it. In addition to paying back 30% of the original mortgage price according to local custom, the construction cost was used as the mortgage price to re-establish the contract, and the mortgage was extended to the thirty-fourth year. The friend claimed the contract signed in the twelfth year was burned and did not care. When the term expired and he went to redeem it, Jia suddenly took out the new contract and claimed that the old contract from the twelfth year was invalid and that he should obtain ownership of the house. After a friend presented witness testimony and material evidence, he filed a lawsuit in court. Both the first and second trials were won, but Jia refused to accept the appeal to the Supreme Court. After more than a year of official documents going back and forth, the house is still occupied by Jia. May I ask what remedial measures can be taken to make him move out first? After the judgment is made in the future, should Jia compensate for all losses in addition to litigation costs?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied] After the lawsuit has been filed, you should wait quietly for the final judgment of the Supreme Court. If you want Jia to move out of the house first, you must determine whether the first and second trials have declared provisional execution. As for the aspect of damages, you should file a motion with the court for a ruling.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>(Shu Baohua of Hankou Road and Zhou Zhen of Guofu Men Road asked) It is extremely difficult to get through on local calls at noon. Is there any way to remedy this? (Answer) It is not difficult to communicate on calls within the jurisdiction of this bureau. However, when dialing users of the Shanghai Telephone Company, the number of relay lines between this bureau and the various bureaus of that company, including the north and south districts, is currently only 220 pairs. According to statistics, users of this bureau account for more than 90% at noon. Dialing the company's users must be connected through these relay lines, resulting in line congestion and difficulty in getting through. When making calls at noon, users are asked to avoid unnecessary socializing and conversations in order to achieve mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>(Zhao Shuchuan of Bingxing Road asked) What are the procedures and methods for sending and receiving telegrams by telephone? (Answer) In order to facilitate users with more telegrams, this bureau has opened a new method of "sending and receiving telegrams by telephone." Users can use the telephone to directly read the telegram to the telecommunications bureau, and can specify a code to avoid miscommunication. This service requires registration and is of a subscription nature. A monthly fee must be prepaid. The fee is divided into six levels, namely 1 million, 3 million, 5 million, 10 million, 15 million, and 20 million. For details, please contact the Business Section of this bureau at 70 Fuzhou Road or call 11490-52.</p>

<p>Lost Child: This afternoon, I encountered a child crying by the roadside near the Xihai Grand Theater on Xinzha Road. Knowing that he was lost, I stepped forward to inquire. He claimed to be named Zhang Zhongliang, eight years old. When asked about his home address, he was at a loss. The child was wearing a gray silk lined robe, a cotton robe made of woolen cloth, gray striped coarse cloth trousers, had a round face, several small scars on his forehead, his head slightly flat on the right side, spoke with a southern accent, and had a flat haircut. I immediately took him back to my team in the Jiangning Branch of Gorden Road and kept him for lodging and food. Please publish a notice in your newspaper to help find him. This is a request. Respectfully, Police Officer No. 1364, First Squadron, Mobile Unit, Shanghai Police Department</p>
