<h3>中國內政不容干涉反對列入會議議程　王外長對蘇京會議聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕外長王世杰，十一日對於莫斯科會議發表聲明如下：</p>
<p>外電所傳，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫建議，中國問題，列入莫斯科四國外長會議之議程中，由國政府尚未接到關於此事之任何正式通知，但關於此事，中國政府於前决照會四國外長時，業經剴切聲明，此次莫斯科會議之議程，應絕對限於討論德奧和約問題，任伺其他議題之增列，必須事前由五國外長協商決定，中國之此項立塲，曾經得到英·法·美三國政府之支持，蘇聯政府復本人之照會，對於此點，亦未表示異議。</p>
<p>查外長會議中，任何會員國之內政問題，決不在該一會議討諭之列，此種問題，並不得成爲其他會員國協議之對象，此乃不容忽視之要義。</p>
<p>不論在何種方式之下，中國政府，均不能同意將中國內政問題列於外長會讓之議程。　〔又電〕美大使司徒雷登，十一日午往訪王部長世杰，有所商洽。</p>
<p>〔社南京十一日電〕立法院長孫科博士，今日接見本社記者，認爲蘇外長莫洛托夫所提四強外長在莫斯科討論中國問題之建議，爲「不友善舉動，至少含有侮辱態度」。未經中國代表參加而討諭中國間題之建議，必遭中國之反對，中國堅決反對關於中國內政之任伺團際干涉，不諭其爲美國，蘇聯或任可其也國家。中國幷菲國際殖民也。美國務卿馬歌爾所稱，如無中國代表出席，不應討論中國問題之言，頗爲正確。記者問以莫氏出人意料之建議，是否表示蘇聯將公開支持中共之意，孫院長答稱：「或有此意，但無論如何，比頃建議乃干涉中國之內政」。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫提議討論中國問題　馬歇爾稱美不能贊同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十一日廣播：四國外長十一日上午八時（東方標準時間）召開第二次會議，對於中國應被邀參加會議一項建議，莫洛托夫表示拒絕，其理由爲中國未參與一九四五年莫斯科三强協定。在另一方面，莫氏堅決要求將中國問題列入議程。又蘇聯方面謂，馬歇爾原則上已同意外長會議討論中國問題，美方十一日予以否認。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日上午二時廣播：外長會議二次會中，莫浴托夫再度要求討論中國問題，據謂：此次外長會議必須論及遠東問題，以前協議各點，若能予以遵守，則不特裨益美，蘇關係，且將有助於中國內部和平之恢復。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十一日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日下午在此間招待記者稱：美國將反對在本屆外畏會議中不使中國參加即行由四强討論中國問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫，本日在四國外長會議開幕席上，投下一枚外交炸彈，提議將中國問題列入議程，美國務鄕馬歇爾在驚異神色之中，即行發表其意見，謂對此建議須至十一日始能表示態度，並謂：中國代表若不參加，則不能正當討論此一問題，莫洛托夫則認爲無需中國代表參加。繼主張可將中國事件列爲補充題目，加以討諭。當莫氏提出中國問題時，英外相貝文與法外長皮杜爾皆未發一言，嗣經馬歇爾建議，乃展至十一日再予討論。按中國爲波茨坦所定五强外長會議之一，而蘇聯今則堅持排斥中國參加任何國際大會，例如日本投降後，一九四五年九月在倫敦召開首屆四强會議時，蘇聯即首先拒絕中國參加，第二屆在莫斯科開會時，則使有英·美·蘇三國參加，第三屆在巴黎召開討論軸心附庸國之和的及在紐約召開第四屆會議時，中國皆未獲參加，以言法國，雖亦未參加一九四五年十二月之會議，但莫洛托夫今並無拒絕法代表參加討論中國間題之意。</p>
<p>提案全文</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十一日電〕莫洛托夫在四國外長會議第一次集會中所提，在議程中增加中國問題案之全文如下：</p>
<p>「蘇聯代表團對於會議之議程有一提講。」</p>
<p>「如所週知，在一九四五年之莫斯科會議中，英·美·蘇外長曾同意，中國有在國民政府領導之下，實行統一與民主化之必要，有停止內戰與在廣泛基礎上改組政府，使中國之民主政府之各組織中，應包括一切民主份子之必要」。</p>
<p>「各外長亦曾同意，遵守不干涉中國內政之原則。」</p>
<p>「關於在任務終了後，美·蘇駐華軍隊應在最短之可能時期內撤退事，美·蘇外長亦有詳細之協定。」</p>
<p>「然自一九四五年莫斯科三國外長會議以迄於今，中國之局勢未見改善，因此，蘇聯政府提議，外長會議應聽取前莫斯科中國協定參加者，如何執行其決議案之報告。」</p>
<p>該公報末稱：美國務卿馬歇爾己「同意將此問題列入議程中，」然渠要求勿立時加以討論，「俾研究討論此問題之程序。」</p>
<h3>瀋安路通車</h3>
<p>〔中央社安東十一日電〕潘安鐵路十日正式通車，恢復上月廿四日以前之狀態，上午八時及九時半，先後有客車二列，自安東車站開出，旅客甚夥，咸以極興奮之心情，登車西下，惟此次瀋安通車途中，仍需歷時二日，旅客難免於公原或本溪住宿一宵，直達車至遲於四月底必能實現。</p>
<h3>顧大使發表聲明　對蘇外長建議驚詫不置認此舉有違聯合國憲章</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕我國駐美大使顧維鈞，今日在其評論莫洛托夫建議將中國問題列入外長會議議程一事之正式聲明中稱：此事殊令人驚詫不置，因其建議事先並未就商中國。顧氏稱：不干涉一國之內政，乃國際公法旣經規定之原則，並經列入聯合國憲章中。顧氏繼稱：中國已不解何故在莫斯科會議中中國未能包括在內，因根據波茨坦協定，中國乃外長會議之一份子也，但就其本身問題而論，依照國際禮節與友誼，理應先就商中國，且在任何情况下，舉凡關於中國問題之任何討論，均應邀請中國參加。目前，莫斯科會議之參加國家政府，亦早知中國人民之對此强烈情緒，若會議對中國直接有關問題之任何討論無中國參加，而予進行，實爲不可思議。</p>
<h3>東北將領會議　定十四日在長春舉　魯東膠縣有激烈巷戰</h3>
<p>〔本報長春十一日電〕據悉：東北高級將領，定十四日在長舉行軍事會議，對綏區治安及松江兩岸軍事問題有所商討。</p>
<p>〔本報長春十一日電〕十日上午由五家站渡江南犯之共軍第一師及十六師一部，經新一軍迎頭痛擊，共軍死傷三百餘衆，潰逃江北，國軍虜獲步槍一百四十枝輕重機槍八挺。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十一日電〕廖耀湘在鞍山對本報記者談：東北共軍經入個月整訓，或使人增加對共軍有新的神秘之惑，但經此次共軍春季攻勢，缺　暴露無遺。缺點中如對松花江　頭堡未能攻下，對新武器不　使用等，都是很好的例證。國軍目前或不致攻取哈爾濱。</p>
<p>〔中央社吉林十一日電〕軍息：其塔木西北　花江南岸一帶，又有共軍出沒，國軍刻正沿江搜索。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日電〕膠濟東段膠東重站，十日晚一度被共軍突人，經國軍自東西兩面夾擊，十一日晨已收復。至膠縣方面，則正展開猛烈爭奪戰。濰縣及昌樂外圍，情况無變化。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島十一日電〕進犯膠縣藍村之共軍，十日晚十時又集中全力，附孢廿餘門，向膠縣再度猛攻，膠縣守軍血戰竟夜，迄十一晨三時，共軍集中生力，猛攻北門，戰况異常慘烈，至五時共軍三千餘人突破北門，刻已與我守軍展開激烈巷戰。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十一日電〕寗陽國軍十一日沿津浦路西側繼續向北推進，並收復寗陽城北十七公里之安莊，梁村，新集等據點，共軍向南驛潰退，國軍正追擊中。又兗州北上國軍，十一日收復梁家莊。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十一日電〕臨沂國軍爲策應津浦綫反繫作戰，十一日向費縣城郊掃蕩。順利收復陳莊堡子薛村等據點。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十日電〕魯境國軍各兵團，連日兼程堆進，極爲迅速，近日即可收復泰安。徐濟間津浦路短期內可望打通。</p>
<h3>陳總長飛濟視察</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州十一日電〕陳總長顧總司令，十一日上午十一時乘機飛濟南視察，下午四時許返徐。</p>
<h3>三中全會提案擬成　今交中常會討論　與會中委今日開始報到</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕三中全會提案，業經草擬完成，共五條：（一）經濟改革案，（二）政治改革案，（三）黨務改革案，（四）憲政案，（五）增加稅收案。交十二日晨舉行之中常會例會中討諭，然後交大會。總裁提案現尚未送達。對中共問題之議案，聞亦未作量後決定，故五案中尚未涉及。又中央黨部各部門之工作報告，早已編纂完成。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕三中全會中央委員報到，定十二日開始辦理。地點在中央黨部會客室，報到時並可領取新證章，交通工具，入塲證及住宿證等。</p>
<h3>美國權威輿論主張切實援華　盼我國消除和平障碍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕據外交界消息，近來美國權威輿論，對中國問題之態度，似有若千轉變例如：（一）紐約時報社評謂中國切需美方援助，美國之援助亦應以增加中國人民自給與生產力量爲鵠的。（二）洛杉磯時報指出中共祇能用兵力强迫推行共產主義，但其掠奪農產品及壓迫農民，實與其目的背道而馳。中國政府祗須實施憲法，進行改組，即無共黨參加，美國人亦信其必有進步，仍願予以援助。（三）芝加哥每日新聞社論，強調蔣主席必先努力統一中國，方能開始其建設工作，而美國對華政策，惟知以援助新中國之建設爲目的，不問遇何阻力，仍須始終堅持，以求專澈。就以上各報議論觀測，美國人殆已不耐煩中共之破壞中國和平，阻撓中國統一，間接妨碍國際貿易之發一展，其希望中國改組政府，完成統一之願，日益迫切。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十一日電〕可靠人土稱：美國對華政策協會今日上書杜魯門總統及其他要人，籲請美國政府重新考盧其以前之決定，准許中國政府購買價值七千五百萬美元之軍火與彈藥。該會指出美國在華調解失敗後，中國政府務須收復東北與台灣，故美國不應再拒絕給予軍事配備，此項配備乃恢復國內秩序及收復領土所必需，亦即故總統羅斯福依照開羅宣言向中國保證者也云。</p>
<h3>白部長赴台宣慰　府令權宜處理紛擾事件朱紹良昨抵京晉見主席</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕國府十二日令：特派國防部部長白崇禧前往台灣宣　，並着對於此次紛擾事件，查明實際情形，權宜處理，此令。　〔本報南京十一日電〕白崇禧奉派赴台宣慰，如無他故牽延，定十一日晨飛滬轉台。同行者有史料局長吳石，秘書楊受琼，參謀鍾長江等十餘人。白氏於十一日十時在該部接見由滬來京之「二二八」事件聯合後援會代表張邦傑，陳皓笙，楊肇嘉，王麗明，林松模等五人，相談約一小時。白氏盼該代表等轉告合胞，嚴守紀律，勿爲奸黨利用，並轉達主席對台灣事件實大之德意。</p>

<h3>金州大連接收期近　傳蘇聯駐軍定十五日撤退　徐箴等飛京請示接收機宜</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十一日電〕此間盛傳蘇方可能於十二日通知我方，蘇軍將遷出金州，大連。又聞大連蘇方曾對我同胞稱：本月十五日將大通及金州等地交還我方。</p>
<p>〔合眾社北平十一日電〕據瀋陽電訊：根據中國與旅順蘇軍當局之協議，中國政府定於三月十五日接收大連。聞第一批開入大連維持秩序者，乃已在瀋陽曾經數月特別訓練之特別警察隊，現尚待蘇方之最後通知。據此間軍界消息，現有若干跡象，表示共軍或將阻止國軍開入大連</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十一日電〕近期內旅大可能出現一新局面，因關係方面人士根據（一）旅大食糧行將告密，（二）某方搬運工作亦至相當程度，故有此論斷。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十一日電〕東北行轅參謀長董英斌，遼寗省主席徐箴，曁外交部東北特派員蘇劍非，十一日晨九時飛京。此行任務純係向最高當局請示關於接收大連等重要問題。王外長日前來瀋時，曾對東北全面接收事宜有所指示，並搜集有關資料董·徐·張三氏晉京，　有此類有關重要文件，向中央詳為請示機宜。</p>
<p>〔又電〕熊式輝曾於十日召趙家驤大連市府秘書長董光斗等，聞對接收大連事有關。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十一日電〕旅順大連，金州逃出之難胞，日來益多，民眾情緒似已不能再忍，此點頗値重視。鞍山粥廠，近有千餘人就食，為狀至慘，據對本報記者談：渠等至金州迤北不受限制，至右河後曾受蘇軍阻止，但終於黑夜爬越山嶺北來。</p>
<h3>立院會議通過建議案　財部不得發大鈔　貨物稅條例草案修正</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕立法院今上午例會時，於四十分鐘之熱烈討論激辯後，通過委員樓桐孫·譚惕吾·戴修駿·劉通等提議之建議國防最高委會，嚴令財部立即停止發行票面金額一萬元之券幣，並絕對不得再發票面金額一萬元以上之券幣案。其理由為：年來政府平抑物價，種種努力，迄今尚未收預期之效果，二百五十元及五百元新關鑫券發行未久，近又見有五千元及一萬元大額法幣之發行，對平抑物價之努力，自不免發生抵銷之作用，甚且仍足以刺激物價之上升，殊難貫澈經濟緊急措施方案之初衷，達成穩定物價安定市面之初步目的；為此，擬請建議國防最高委會嚴令財政部，立即停止發行票面金額一萬元以上之券幣，嗣後並絕對不發行票面金額一萬元以上之幣券，以期與救經濟危機，今日例會由孫院長主席，除上述一案外，並通過（一）法制委會報告審查革命抗戰功勛子女就學免費補助條例草案案，（二）法制委員會報告審查修正國府參軍處組織法第八條條文草案案，（三）經濟委會會同法制委會報告審查修正經濟部技工訓練處組織條例草案案，（四）財政委會會同經濟委會報告審查修正貨物稅條例各條文草案案，（五）財政委會會同法制委會報告審查財部　政局組織法草案案。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕修正貨物稅條例各條文草案，業於十一日晨立院三百十七次例會通過。此次最重要修正之點，為棉紗從價稅稅率由原來之百分之五，增至百分之七，財部原主將其增至百分之十，審查時各立委僉認棉線從價稅去年僅為百分之三點五，現為增裕稅收，酌予提高，然若將其提至百分之十，則未免過高，決議改為百分之七。今日會中討論時，于振瀛反對提高，最後決議照審查意見通過，新立委社會賢達劉友琛，認化裝品從價稅百分之四十五似嫌過低，主張提高，惟經討論後仍照原案通過。</p>
<h3>紡管委會成立　未經立法手續</h3>
<p>立院決向政院提諮詢</p>

<h3>反對干涉！抗議侮辱！</h3>
<p>莫斯科四國外長會議開幕的第一天。莫洛托夫卽要求將中國問題列入外長會議的議程內：蘇聯的用意何在？實在令人費解，不僅出於我們的意料之外，就是美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥，也未能料及，不得不表示詫異。所以莫洛托夫提出這個建議，不啻向外交界投一炸彈，震動了整個世界的平靜，匪特引起我國全國人民的憤慨，抑且也要使全世界正義感的人士表示不平。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫提出這個建議時，曾在外長會議中加以說明，其言有曰：『一九四五年莫斯科三國外長會議時，英美蘇三國外長曾一致同意，認為中國應在國民政府領導之下實行民主政治及保持統一，由全國所有民主份子廣大參加政府各機關，並應卽停止內亂；同時三國外長並言重聲明，遵守不干涉中國內政之政策。此外，美蘇兩國外長又成立一項協議，均願兩國軍隊，一俟其所負之義務與責任完成之後，卽自中國撤退，不稍遲延，惟自是迄今，中國局勢仍未見改善，因此蘇聯政府提議，凡參加莫斯科三國外長會議之各國代表，應向四國外長會議報告此項決議實施之結果。』</p>
<p>這種強辭奪理的論調，不論在法理上或道義上，都是不能成為理由的。誠如立法院長孫科氏對美國合眾社記者所稱，莫洛托夫的提議是『一種不好友的行動，否則祗少是一種侮辱中國的態度。』我們對於蘇聯的用意，姑置勿論，先就法理的觀點。陳述我們的幾項意見。</p>
<p>第一，在莫斯科四國外長會議的前夕，我國外交當局早已照會四國外長，表示希望此次莫斯科外長會議之議程，僅能以歐洲問題為限，對於中國或遠東，若欲成立任何協議，事前必須商得中國政府的同意。四國政府對此均未表示異議，當可視為默認。而今莫洛托夫突然要求將中國問題列入議程內，並堅決拒絕邀請中國代表參加，究有什麼理由可言呢？</p>
<p>第二，依照波茨坦協定的規定，所謂外長會議，係由中英美法蘇五國外長所組成，中國實有參加歷屆外長會議的資格，但截至目前為止，中國僅參加過一次倫敦五國外長會議，而這次會議，又因蘇聯反對中國參加討論歐洲問題，以致不歡而散，其後在莫斯科召開第二次外長會議，中國固未參加，就是第三次在巴黎第四次在紐約舉行，因蘇聯的反對，也沒有參加。去年十二月間，美國國務卿貝爾納斯主張邀請中國出席莫斯科外長會議，又因蘇聯表示異議而未能成為事實；今年二月間四國外次會議討論中國應否為對德和會召集一項問題時，蘇聯代表葛塞夫不顧英美法三國代表的反對，堅持其不承認中國為對德國和會之召集國的一貫主張。凡此種種，均可看出蘇聯對於中國的態度，不僅不惜違背波茨坦協定之規定，而且還要公然侮辱中國的國際地位，所以莫洛托夫的提議，是其故意侮辱中國的一種手法。</p>
<p>第三，這一次的莫斯科四國外長會議，和上一次的莫斯科三國外長會議的性質，是截然不同的。一九四五年莫斯科三國外長會議，係為倫敦五國外長會議不歡而散後所召開的，其目的在使三強對於一切國際問題謀得諒解協調，從而打開歐洲及遠東的僵尸：故其所討論的問題，非常廣泛，幾乎觸及戰後所有的一切問題。但是這次莫斯科四國外長會議的議程，去年紐約四國外長會議時，早已決定，以起草對德對奧和約為其唯一的課題。而今莫洛托夫突然提出中國問題，無異於捨本逐末，其影響所及不僅要引起中國人民的憤慨，而且也足以打破會議前夕國際間所有的和諧空氣，使這次外長會議更沒有成功的希望，實在不是一種賢明之舉。</p>
<p>由此說來，莫洛托夫提出這種建議，在法理上，毫無根據，自不待言。再從其所提建議的內容加以檢討，也可以看出莫洛托夫的強詞奪理。依照一九四五年莫斯科三國外長會議所發表的公報，關於中國問題的一部份，規定三點：（一）三國外長對於中國局勢交換意見，一致同意在國民政府領導之下，應有一民主的統一的中國，應由國內民主份子廣大參加政府各機關，同時應卽停止內戰；（二）三國外長重言聲明，遵守不干涉中國內政之下政策，（三）美蘇兩國外長同意，兩國在華軍隊，一俟其所負之義務與責任完成之後，卽自中國撤退，不稍遲延。</p>
<p>關於第一點，三國外長對於中國的共同意見，也正是我國朝野日夜所期望的。中國政府在一九四五年十二月三國外長會議之前，早已向着這個和平統一的目標邁進，且不惜委曲求全，與中共進行和談，力求循着政治的途徑，謀得和平統一的實現。但是和談一年餘來，卒因中共的堅持條件及其武力奪取政權的野心而陷於決裂；以致迄今未達到預定的目標；但是政府為表現盡其在我的精神計，不問中共的態度如何？依舊向着這個目標前進，現在除了中共及民盟而外，國內所有民主份子大半已參加政府，「由國內民主份子廣大參加政府各機關」，不久就可以完全實現了。</p>
<p>至於第二層，三國外長重言聲明遵守不干涉中國內政的政策，我們不得不指出，莫洛托夫提出這個建議，就是蘇聯未能履行這個諾言的明證。中國人對於中國問題自有其自謀解決之道，毋須莫洛托夫操心；至於我國請求美國的出面調處，係出於我國的自願，故歡迎迎美國來華斡旋；迨至其聲明放棄調處，我們也沒有強求；故不能視為美國干涉中國的內政；而今莫斯科外長會議，我國外交當局早已聲明，不願將中國問題列入議程，而蘇聯外長偏偏要提出來，而且堅決拒絕中國代表參加討論，這豈非干涉中國的內政？怎能與美國調處我國內爭混為一談呢？</p>
<p>關於最後一點，美國駐華軍隊，因其任務逐漸完成，早已分批陸續自中國撤退了；此在蘇聯軍隊呢？不僅其任務，早已完成，而且其自中國撤退，也早應實行。但是在旅順大連的蘇軍，依然按兵不動！所以我們不得不指出，違背莫斯科三國外長會議宣言的國家，並不是美國，而是蘇聯自己！</p>
<p>要之，蘇聯為什麼處處要反對我國參加國際會議？莫洛托夫又為什麼敢侮辱中國至此地步？這些問題固然値得我們痛切反省與警惕；但是蘇聯對於其昔日的盟邦竟一再橫加侮辱，決非我國全國人民所能容忍的；我們雖然非常珍惜中蘇兩國間的，但是我們決不能逆來順受。所以，我們不能不大聲疾呼：反對國際干涉，並抗議莫洛托夫的侮辱態度，務使蘇聯當局也能明暸，中國的民氣之不可侮！</p>

<h3>立院會議亦荘亦諧　停發大票案爭辯記　樓桐孫慷慨陳辭周一志大講笑話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕停發萬元大鈔案，十一日晨於立院例會提出時，引起饒有興趣之辯論，致使全塲於亦荘亦諧氣氛中，爭辯此關係民生殊鉅之要案。若干委員因彼此意見各異，竟怒目相向，均不相讓，最後賴原提案人樓桐孫，冷靜分析，慷慨陳詞，卒以多數通過。</p>
<p>此一要案係十二立委連署提出。該案提出後，即由原提案人樓桐孫說明，略謂：政府發行大鈔，固有其財政理由，然一部份原因，聞為千元二千元鈔票印刷成本過鉅，惟我人應指出一點，即國家為印行小額鈔票而蒙受之影響，若與國民經濟因大鈔發行而受之損失相較，則誠微不足道，人民應付經濟問題，往往僅憑直覺，大鈔足以刺激人心，故應隆重發行。樓氏並指出戴修駿等曾建議由立院制定一發行法，以限制法幣發行額。</p>
<p>繼由戴修駿致詞，說明政治上固有請求法治必要，經濟上亦不可無法治，若能制定一發行法，可起絕大安定作用。</p>
<p>至此，反對派即起反駁，王毓祥指出大鈔攜帶便利，印刷成本亦廉，在此惡性膨脹時代，發行大鈔並無大礙。</p>
<p>諶小岑認當前主要問題為如何平衡預算，不此之圖，而僅從停發大鈔着手，無異掩耳盜鈴。</p>
<p>周一志講「笑話，說明大鈔便利，據稱：上海近有四五人同至舞塲跳舞，預計非百萬元不足盡歡，深感攜帶不便，乃計劃裝在一小箱中，用汽車載往，待跳畢後，再由司機點鈔付帳，若有大鈔，當不致有此情事。</p>
<p>衛挺生亦認此案為「治標中之治標辦法」，無異於為恐刺激病人而將其牀頭寒暑表取去。</p>
<p>陳茹玄等不以為然，指出「若謂此舉係掩耳盜鈴，則發行無準備金之紙幣，豈不更為掩耳盜鈴之舉乎？」此一建議，若能為政府採納，定可收安定人心之效，遽加反對，實無理由。」</p>
<p>樓桐孫再起發言，駁斥一志等攜帶方便說法，指出不可貪圖個人便利而忽視其對國民經濟心理所起之不良影響；抗戰期間，發行五百元大鈔，影響人心，刺激物價之故事，當時身在後方者當能記得，即就近事而言，二百五十元五百元關金券一出。卒致掀起此次金鈔狂漲，此類悲慘教訓想不致為人遺忘，我人決不可因此案「善小而不為」，凡一切與日常經濟現象有補之事，我人皆應為之，何況此事又輕而易舉？</p>
<p>鐘天心舉汕頭，廣州情形為便，說明全國各地仍多用小鈔者，汕頭今日仍可以三千元租得洋房一幢，五千元一月僱一奶媽，我人眼光應遍及全國，偏僻地點亦須顧到，不應專注意於京滬兩地，應知大鈔發行後，對全國無數老百姓將起何種影響。</p>
<p>至此，各委員爭相分別發言，同時起立者有三五人，或瞪眼，或把拳。孫院長對此惟有微笑而已。</p>
<p>最後，樓桐孫提出其最有力之論據，說明國家信用，憑於通貨幣額，若時時變大，不特失卻穩定作用，抑且自毀國家信用。並謂：此一提案，消極中袢具積極意義，蓋政府若加採納，執政者當不致　費無度。</p>
<p>討論至此，時已十二時，院長乃宣付表決，結果以四十四票多數通過。</p>

<p>〔路透社莫期科十日電〕四國外長會議今日開暮，對於解散德軍國主義的搖籃普魯士邦一點，成立協議。蘇外長莫洛托夫旋乃首先提出中國問題，主張將其列入議程，（參看第一版）馬歇爾表示渠須於星期二始能有肯定答覆。馬谷爾嗣復建議在本屆會讓中，討論限制歐洲境內盟國佔領區數量之問題，莫洛托夫當表示馬歇爾對於中國問題旣須於廿四小時後始能肯定答覆，渠對限制佔領軍之建議，亦須於廿四小時後答覆之。開會時間計歷四十分鐘，四外長均同意採用紐約外長會議所決定之六項議程，即最先討諭者爲德境盟管會之報告書，最末討諭者爲奧國問題。四外長代表定星期二晨將先行討論審查盟管會報告書之最妥當方式，而外長會議則定每日標準時間下午一時（上海晚九時）召開。普魯土問題以及另一，早日討諭特里埃斯特自由區財政委員會報告書之建議，均係英國提出。</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫建議美官方表驚異　美議員楚德斥蘇越俎代謀</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕華盛頓官方人士今日認爲，莫洛托夫建議將中國局勢列入正式議程一事，誠可驚異。美衆議負楚德頃稱：彼反對將中國問題提交莫斯科會議，彼指出一九四五年莫斯科三强會議及雅爾達會議，對於中國曾有協議，但此種之協議，尤其大連案件均遭嚴甫破壞。楚氏稱：在莫斯科討論中國問題，實無理由，一切所需者，實爲蘇聯實行其前次協議耳。中國作戰多年，方克自主其外交，中國問題由四强討論，實屬離奇，若彼等眞實如此，則彼等不啻越俎代庖也。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十一日專電〕美國之無綫電廣播評論員，今日首先對莫洛托夫在莫斯科會讓中提出中國問題一事，予以評諭。渠認爲蘇外長此舉，旨在使其對手美國陷入窘境，從而增強蘇聯之「討價還價」地位。蓋莫氏在歐洲問題中，曾親身感受德國賠償問題裁减佔領軍問題等所予彼之窘迫，故渠今日乃提出中國問題，作爲「討價還價」之點。莫氏似亦在爭取時間，蓋渠先需要時間觀察美國政府及國會對地中海中東（尤其希臘及土耳其）之最後決定，及各國對美國所作決定之反響，然後決定蘇聯在對德奧和約中究應作何種要求或讓步。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十一日電〕法國電台評論員頃在此間分析莫洛托夫對中國問題提案之動機，認爲目標有三：使蘇聯在中國問題攤牌時，居於有利地位；（二）使美國承認在華調解之失敗；（三）準備圓桌會議之基礎，心冷　便解決此一問題。</p>
<h3>捷波簽訂互助約　規定有效期限三十年</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社底德律十日電〕美國務院帮辦希爾特林本日發表廣播演說稱，吾人在朝鮮美國佔領區內，將向朝鮮蘇聯及世界其他各國明白表示，美國之民主對於會受四十年奴役之國家，在經濟上政治上及社會上之復興，將有何種成就，美國以援助畀予希望眞正自由與獨立之民主人民，係出於至誠，此乃朝鮮人民所有目共睹者也。吾人在朝鮮所當應付之問題，對於美國實構成猛烈之挑釁，美國若忽視朝鮮之局勢，必將籌成大錯。爭取朝鮮之控制權，乃爲一八九四年中日戰爭與一九〇四年日俄戰爭之主要原因，日本因控制朝鮮而取得侵略東北之基地，節節前進，終至直搗珍珠港。爲欲防止朝鮮再度成爲今後侵略之基地起見，吾人必須使朝鮮成爲自由民主與自主之國家，此乃維持東方字定之因素。美國在朝鮮所擬實施之計劃，需要朝鮮人民之忍耐。美國必須覓致其與蘇聯諒解之新基地，要之美國之計劃，可綜合如下：即（一）復興朝鮮工業；（二）發展朝鮮之商業；（三）敎育朝鮮人民。</p>
<p>人造界綫必須打破</p>
<p>希爾特林續稱：一九四五年之莫斯科協定，規定將朝鮮分爲兩區，此種劃界綫，本爲臨時之計。殊知十個月後之今日，此一人造的與臨時的界綫仍然存在，宛如阻礙朝鮮統一之石牆。美蘇雙方對於朝鮮臨時政府之設立，意見亦大相出入，因雙方對「民主」一詞解釋不同。美國認為朝鮮各黨代表應與諮商，蘇聯則認為凡反對莫斯科協定之朝鮮人應加摒絕。惟是朝鮮之統一雖吿失敗，美國政府並未沮喪，仍保持堅決的樂觀態度。吾人將留居朝鮮，宜至摧毀猜忌之　垣，並使新朝鮮政治獨立經濟自足而後已</p>

<h3>美管制原子計劃　發還原子能委會討論　蘇修正案在安理會中遭否決</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約成功湖十日電〕聯合國安理會本日議決，調令原子能委員會從速草擬原子能管制計劃之細則，並限於九月十六日完成報告。蘇聯所提之修正案，已予否決。美有席代表奧斯汀興蘇聯外决葛羅米柯對於該訓令之字句曾爭論一小時之久，然後各代表投票一致通過，將此項困難問題發回原子能委員會。據原子能委員會主席葛羅米柯聲稱：渠在決定何時召集原子能委員會第一次會議之前，對此須從長考慮。先是奧斯汀曾發表二十分鐘之演說，指斥蘇聯之管制原子能建議將造成原十軍備之競爭，並將引起戰爭。奧斯汀改發其過去之樂觀態度，以抑鬱語氣談稱：蘇聯之原子能計劃必遭美國之反對蓋此項計劃在積極方面旣不能保障安全，在消極方面且足以引起互不信任及戰爭。蘇聯所提在組織國際調查機構以前即毀滅原子能武器之建議，決不能阻止原子武器之競爭。奧斯汀在要求安理會將聲個問題發還原子能委員會之時，方以樂觀語氣談稱：當該委員會完成技術上細則之時，若干意見上之嚴重衝突或可解決。奧氏並絕對否該美國有獨佔原子能之企圖。法代表巴羅迪抱怨葛羅米柯對美國計劃提出「例外」太多，故發生目前種種問題。巴氏並稱：葛氏不僅指責美國，而且指查該委員會以十對零通過美國建議之全體代表。安理會新理事比利時及哥倫比亞兩國本日亦發表首决談話稱：彼等均贊同美國之建議云。</p>

<h3>蘇國聯經費浩大　佔總預算三分之一</h3>
<p>〔聯台社華盛頓十日電〕此問軍事專家分折蘇聯本年度國防預算，以爲其實數將佔政府全部支出（合美金七百四十二億八千萬元）三分之一，而非如莫斯科電台所謂百分之十八，合美金一百三十四億元。分析蘇聯預算，必須注意兩項事實，即：（一）在美團預算中所應列入軍費之項目，在蘇聯則列入非軍費項目；（二）蘇聯因禱施統制經濟，致其預算經費之購買力，較其他政府爲高。尚有其他各點值得注意者：（一）一大部份國防軍精銳或將歸內政部管轄，其經費合美金二十八億三千萬元。（二）科學研究費中至少有合美金十三億元之經費用於軍事目標；（三）預算中除聯邦支出外，蘇聯每一共和邦均單獨規定軍費；（四）軍事發備之建集，聞歸內政部辦理，大規模徵用政治犯及俘虞之勞力，不給工資；（五）重工業預算包括軍火製造費在內；（六）工業支出中亦列入軍服及其他類似之軍需；（七）農業預算則包括一部份軍糧。</p>
<h3>杜魯門與國會領袖愼重商討中東局勢　將切實闡明美對希政策</h3>

<p>總統或將提讓於必要時，同樣貸款土耳其，據某議員稱：美國對於土耳其可能給予一億玉手萬元借款，其中一部份可用以購買美軍在歐洲之剩餘物資。若干議員並預料總統將要求國會准許在軍事上及財政上同樣援助義大利。國會方面對於總統建議如何決定，對於將來影響非常重大，其重要性或可與美國會於參戰前決定廢止中立法及通過軍備租借法不相上下。</p>

<p>又據警局方面稱，居倫原擬乘上週末總統在呂西納地方遊行演說時動手，後中途變計。警察並押居倫前往，出事地點重演犯罪經過，旋即帶渠面見羅哈斯。據悉羅氏曾問以何故出此，居倫答稱，渠認爲總統不能履　過去諾言，全國經濟腐敗情形顯由總統負責，此次夙願未遂，頗引以爲憾，如有機會，當圖再舉。居倫與菲律賓反對派問有無關係，現尚未悉。</p>

<h3>閘北廣大貧民窟火災　燬棚戶百六十間　建築簡陋消防員無能爲力慘死一孩數百人無家可歸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北寳昌路中興路及香山路一　，昨日下午為大火所籠罩，一百六十餘間棚戶，盡付一炬，災民五六百人，號啕街頭，景象殊慘。並有六歲孩童陳志勇一名，葬身火窟。此外又壓傷戴阿五一人，當時即送市立第四醫院，經包紮後即行出院。</p>
<p>該處棚戶屬於閘北第四十四保，被焚毀之民屋，共有四甲之多’火塲面積廣達八百平方尺，計西起寳昌路，東至賽通路，北達中興路，南迄香山路，此一廣大之平民窟，在不足二小時之時間內，盡成焦土。</p>
<p>查起火者，為寳昌路中興路轉角處之上海校具公司，時為下午二時五十分。因該處所有建築，多為木棚草舍，且有頗多木行等號家，雜於其間，故一經起火，瞬即四處延燒，撲救不易。當時雖經新閘·虹口·中央三消防處派車六架往救，但蒞塲時，卒因已成燎原之勢，故搶救已感不及，惟當時救火員均仍奮不顧身，深入火窟，四處灌救。奈火舌此起彼伏，令人捉換不定，故處境極為危險，消防員因過於深入之故，致有七條皮帶被壓入火塲之中，不及拉出。其火勢之猛烈，與延燒之迅速，由此可見一斑。</p>
<p>當起火之初，居民曾簽起自行撲救，但以機舍多為引火之物，故無效果。迨消防處瞭望台發覺時，業己大火成勢，不可收拾矣。</p>
<p>當時棚戶居民以火起倉卒，老弱婦孺皆慌作一團，搶救像俱與呼老喊幼，聲聞里外，其中更夾入一片號哭之聲，聞之令人心悸。</p>
<p>火熾時。中與里一號陳萬順木行六歲小主陳志勇，因為火所圍，無法衝出，事後在四十四號墻邊發現時，業已燒成烏焦一段，腹破腸流，慘不忍睹。</p>
<p>此次災戶中損失較大者，首推陳富記木行，除全部木材被焚外，尙有卡車一輛，亦以不及開出，焚毀其間，估計損失釣値一萬五千萬元。</p>
<p>北站分局曾派大隊警士與義警第三中隊，共同維持火塲秩序。同時察分局長何權與消防處處長周兆祥亦均親臨督察。迨查明火首為上海校具公司殷家聲時，殷早已畏罪潛逃矣。</p>
<p>大火至下午四時十分時，始因無可再燒，漸趨憶滅，惟婦孺號哭慘呼之聲，則依然未稍减也。</p>
<p>義警在火塲中檢獲二錢重之金戒一隻，上鐫「張順印」字。尙有手錶一隻，及自由車一輛，現均存放交通路二八號義警總隊部中，失主可前往與該隊隊長陸文龍接冶認領。（左圖為火塲全貌，本報攝）</p>

<p>遠在大戰期間，美國海陸軍中即已廣泛應用無綫電打字傳眞電報，凡裝有此項設備之兩地通訊，一方在打字機上打出，另一方打字機之鍵盤，由於電波之振盪，即同時同樣上落，因此瞬息之問，此方打字機上發出之電報已出現於彼方打字機之收電紙上矣。其優點固不僅迅速而已，且因其為機械作用，無需經過電碼翻譯之階段，故凖確性實足爲百分之一百。</p>
<p>大戰以後，美軍剩餘物資中包括此項設備售與我國政府，經交通部電訊局與美國無錢電交通公司合作。聘請該公司專家三人來滬指導裝配及訓練技術人員，業已完成。最近會先行試報，成績甚為優異。現僅待交通部批准後，短期內即可正式開始通報。</p>

<h3>恢復冠軍姿態　華聯勝仁餘　恩卡斯一分勝海陸青甲二晨友輕取鐵路滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕二屆籃球聯賽，昨晚華聯戰仁餘，體育館又有人滿之患。華聯大李未「下海」，據謂係病足，包松圓成了發號施令的代表，結果以五十一比三十六勝仁餘，上半時廿四比十四。另兩塲甲二晨友七十二比四十六勝鐵路滬，甲一恩卡斯最後三分鐘內反敗爲勝，四十五比四十四，最後一剎那僅贏一分。昨晚華聯老包爲理想人物，學祟相任國榮俱平均發展，吳成章良雄尚稱職。仁餘諸球員，靑年有爲，臨陣經騐缺乏，一上塲即露「彈昆琶」姿態。</p>
<p>晨友勝鐵路</p>
<p>晨友王蓉生王炳福連得六分後，鐵路滬張渠（邦綸）才擲中一球，蓉生與史久全獲分不絕增加，不久戰成十六比五，此際鐵路殊呈零落狀態，十分鐘時紀錄爲廿六比九，鐵路王坤錫入替張其昌，上塲立中一球，但對方聲威難於阻擋，十五分鐘時卅八比十三，四十比十三晨友暫停，鐵路張其昌再度參戰，王炳浩退出，上半時五十比十七。</p>
<p>下半時鐵路頃刻立就八分，晨友反難攻入，下半時上塲者爲凌鵬，黃存瑞，張啓臣，史久全，鮑道威五人，爲提起興趣，原非正式陣綫，最後四分鐘六十七比三十八，晨友方全部調入，結果七十五比四十六勝。</p>

<p>海陸青慘敗</p>
<p>恩卡斯與海陸靑一仗，無異美國南北戰爭，結棍的身材，粗暴的動作，頗不少力的表演。初恩卡斯領前，十分鐘後海陸靑以十九比十七超出，繼至各十九，肉搏愈凶，海陸靑以廿五分比廿一分結束上半時。下半時「比武式」的混戰了五分鐘，雙方開始掛分，比賽雖緊張，都是短兵相接的激戰。恩卡斯急追，忽見V開路司基打成卅九分平手，飽萊四十一超出二分，當時即報告四分鐘，葛朋罰出，海陸靑福魯却罰中，彼得瓊投入，成四十二追出恩卡斯一分。開路司基命中，恩卡斯又在上一分。勃魯哈傷脚腕，勃斯倍入替，恩卡斯買休海陸靑福魯却各中一球，四五比四四，恩卡斯多一分，海陸靑在最後呌暫停，不知當時祗有三秒鐘，開始後，鐘鳴在先，球中在後，應判球中無效，海陸靑不勝惋惜，觀衆亦深表同情，結果即爲四十五比四十四。</p>
<p>華聯勝仁餘</p>
<p>仁餘沈鵬舉華聯陳學崇先後罰球建樹首功，張良雄底角遠投三比一，華聯打氣，學崇又中，松圓學崇增至九分，仁餘暫停，老包罰球未中，反被對方吳新運單刀直入，任相成亦包圍投籃，十四比四時，仁餘再呌暫停，仁餘陳渭源入調吳新遝，形勢好轉，沈鵬舉打至九分，華聯老包觀衆呌好，相成常偷「冷飯」，上牟時甘四比十四，阿弟（吳成章）似失常態。</p>
<p>休息再戰，卓國權替張良雄，仁餘則吳新運替陳渭源，姚文彝兩以罰球代仁餘平添二分，吳成章「千呼萬喚，」此時剛成處女作，罰中一球，卓國榮的左手投籃，甚具把握，老包代大李發號施令，昨晚成了全隊柱石，最後四分鐘，四十九比三十，結果五十一比三十六仁餘不敵。</p>

<h3>鮑羅特拉老當益壯</h3>
<p>年將五十榮獲冠軍</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十日電〕里昂舉行國際室內網球比賽，上星期六決賽，法國網球老手鮑羅特拉獲得冠軍，殊出意料之外。按鮑氏現年將近五十，在十餘年前曾稱雄於一時，今老當益壯，殊非意料所及。此外，柯顯亦爲法國網球界之老將，現年四十四歲，曾在埃及獲得網球錦標，預料此二老將不久將作比賽，各靑年網球家均將側目而視。</p>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽，昨夕爆出一絕大冷門：海睦靑以一分之差，敗於恩卡斯，斷送錦標希望。</p>
<p>恩卡斯之勝乃戰略上的成功，並非倖致，格朋乞谷夫負責死守海陸靑長人中鋒福魯克，極爲稱職，切斷海陸靑攻守之聯緊，再以馬漢興奧柴遼兩員短小悍將，穿鑽奪球，運送近籃，派傳伺候兩側之鮑萊及E凱羅斯蓋獲分。</p>
<p>兩隊動作混亂，拖泥帶水，全賽絕少淸晰美妙之籃下球，雙方各賴中距離投射得分。上半時恩卡斯曾以十四比六領前，下半時海陸靑一度以三十五比廿七佔優，恩卡斯長力充沛，卒能反敗爲勝。</p>
<p>恩卡斯擊敗海陸靑，間接替華聯造機會。</p>
<p>另一幕華聯輕取仁餘，大李因傷未上塲，仁餘求勝心切，演出反常，爲該隊本季最劣的一塲表演，旣無進攻方法，守亦失於疏懈，射籃更嫌輕率，形成一團糟。</p>
<p>老包代大李任主將，攔，救，刦·射，精彩之至，惟下半時嫌過份賣弄。吳成章雖在塲，但不出力，任相成傳球昨晚殊多失誤，遠傳旣欠穩妥，豈宜濫用。卓國榮下半時上塲，興學崇有默契傳遞。</p>
<p>比數恒相差五球，下半時戰至四十五比廿八時，優　形勢已判，觀衆陸續離塲。（昌年）</p>

<h3>絲織業聯營公司不接受海外定貨</h3>
<p>絲織業聯營公司最近已有織成之外銷織　六百疋以上，惟過去印商所定貨品，因受政府整外踪影響而取消合同，或延不覆行貿易行爲者甚多。故今後該公司將與本地外商洽妥、以銷售現貨爲原則，對定貨暫不接收，以免將來因幣制問題而增加糾紛。</p>

<h3>紀念國父逝世　求取中國之自由平等</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>二十二年前的今日，國父因肝疾不治，逝世於北平鐵獅子胡同行臘，那時候中開的局面，是南方的國民革侖軍甫自廣東出激，沿途處處遭受軍閥的阻撓；北方和中原半壁，則完全在封建殘餘的軍人和政客手中，袁世凱時代以來黑暗的言僚政治，籠罩着大半個中國。國父那决所以不頸許多同志的諫阻，扶病從廣州到北方去，爲的也就是希望能說服這許多以私利爲重的政客軍閥，謀取中國的和平與統一。民國成立以後的十三年來，情形實在是太使國父痛心了。連年的軍閥戰亂，弄得滿目瘡痰，　困民貧，新生的國家非但無建設之望，甚且沒有過一刻喘息的機會，只靠了外債來飲　止渴，這種情形下，國家要想從决殯民地的地位下翻身起來，自然是絕不可能的。國父感覺革命要得到眞正的成功，第一必須有深入人心的革命思想，所以他手訂了三民主義；第二必須有立國的確定辦法，所以他寫下了建國大綱和家國方略；第三必須使人民能淸楚了解目前國家所處的境地，而深自警惕，所以他起草了第一次全國代表大會宣會。有了這種種，並且使全國人民能充分了解了它們的意義與價值，中國才能够慢慢建設起來，强大起來，達到這最後的目標：國家的自由與平等。</p>
<p>這就是民國十四年三月十二日國父責志病逝時的思想的黃景。在遺囑中，國父也以此諄諄囑告後人。遺囑的內容，現在當然是每個人都十分熟悉了，但也正因爲太熟悉了，所以反或容易忽略了其中所包括的重要意義。遺囑中有兩節是最最主要的，第一節就是「余致力國民革命，凡四十年，其目的在求中國之自由平等，」這是指國父一生革命的目標和理想；第二節就是「最近主張，開國民會議，及廢除不平等條的」，這是指達到道種理想的方法與步驟。</p>
<p>血肉換來的國際地位　別讓他一落千丈</p>
<p>這短短幾句話裏所包含的意義，在今日尤其值得我們深自反省。什麼呌做「中國之自由平等」呢？就對外的意義說，中國應該有其獨立自立的國際地位，不受任何片面不平等條約的拘束；在外交上有獨立行動的力量與勇氣，不致因利害關係的影響而屈服讓步，尤其是：中國獨立國家的國格，必須充分受到全世界國家的認識與尊重。就對內的意義說，則國內一切民族，一切地域，一切階層，俱有其爲國家法律所規定的自由與平等，並充分受到國家法律的尊重與保護。</p>
<p>就這個意義來說，我們今日的情形，距國父的理想實在是太遠了。在此我們必須注意：在抗戰勝利，侵略我們最久最很毒的敵人日本帝國主義者屈膝投降以後，我們原本極有機會，可以漸漸達成國父的這個理想。但不幸，這種機會稍縱即逝了，由於內亂的爆發，交通破壤，建設停滯，物價飛漲，民不聊生，政治和經濟上秩序的混亂，竟比抗戰之時更不如。於是，八年抗戰，千千萬萬人血肉所換來的一點國際地位，又告一落千丈。今日的中國，在國際上是不是已有眞正的自由平等？在此國父逝世二十二週年的今日，這是值得每個中國人慚愧警惕的第一點。</p>
<p>其次，國父在遺囑中說到，要達成國家自由平等的目標，第一必須召開國民會議，使內部能和平統一；第二必須廢除不平等條約，使中國能在國際上得到自主的地位。這兩點，在表面上看來，可以說都已成功了。去年十一月至十二月間所召開的國民大會，集全國碩彥於一堂，制定了國家根本的憲法，使中國更進一步，獲得了統一法治的雛形。這本是國父生前所股殷囑望，建國大綱中亦即以憲法頒布，憲政成功作爲立國程序的最終階段。這次所通過的憲法，本是根據政治協商會議中的修改原則，而重加改訂的，應該可得中共方面的滿意，但結果，他們却仍借籍別的理由，拒絕參加國民大會，甚至關閉了和談協商之門，使原來象徵國家民主統一的憲法，在實行上仍受到了武力的阻難。</p>
<p>不平等條約是廢除了　不平等地位未秘訣至於不平等條約，如滿淸時代所簽訂下來的領事截判權，駐兵權，租界地，內河航行權等等，是都已在抗戰接近勝利時候廢除了，代替的是互相平等的新的。本來，這許多不平等的條款，都是腐敗昏庸的滿淸政府所簽訂的，革命後的民國原可不必承認，不過，當時因爲革命的力量尚未十分團結穩固，爲了顧慮現實的困難，，不得不仍承認了這些不平等條約約有效。不過不平等條約的廢除，乃是國父至死未曾忘懷的一件事情，也是政府二十年來辛苦奮鬥竭力希望做到的事情。終於，因爲國家在抗戰中所表現的勇氣與力量，受到了盟邦的同情和尊敬，所以早在三十年五月閒，中美兩國便已有關於取銷不平等條約的初步商討了—至三十二年一月十一日，中美中英間的平等新約均告簽訂，法國及其他各國，亦皆先後聲明放棄在中國的一切特權，另訂新約。東縛中華民族達一百年的不平等條約，乃告廢除。</p>
<p>表面上的不平等條款，固然是廢除了，但事實上，中國在國際上的地位，是不是已經得到了平等呢？一個國家在國際上的能不能够得到平等地位主要地是看這個國家有沒有統一强大的力量，使人不敢輕侮。上年巴黎廿一國和會開會，商討對默和約之際，中國欲列入邀請國，亦竟爲人所反對。現在，莫斯科的外長會議亦已開幕了，在對德和約的商討中，以中國與德國經濟關係如此之深，竟不能有一插嘴的餘地。而且，據說此次會中或更將涉及中國內部問題。圓想舊金山會議迄今，曾幾何時，中國竟已從四强或五强之一，一降而爲被人在會議桌上討論的問題了，其地位己一如歐洲戰敗的附庸小國！不平等條約雖然是廢除了，但不平等的地位却依然存在。</p>
<p>運用時權云埋冰龍　　　必達到獨立自由</p>
<p>中國要怎樣才能眞正解除一切不平等條約的束總，而從一個决殖民地的國家蛻復而成爲眞正獨立自生的開家呢？很淸楚的，第一，國內必須和平統一使一切力量能够集中起　，一切破壞必須立即停止，一切紊亂必須立即改變，第二，利用這日本帝國主義者集巳戰敗，外來的阻書已經查除約有利環境。把一切力量用之於　內的建設。如此，眞正的自由平等才可能到來。</p>
<p>我們今日　到國父還囑中「求中國之自由平等」這句話，心中眞是無限感恢，無限慚愧。國父逝世巳經二十二年了，他所諄諄囑付我們的話，我們已做到了幾分？我們原可有機會達到道個理想的目標，但爲何又如此不爭氣，坐視這個機會輕輕溜過？今日深切想一想。國父已淸楚指示出了我們的路途，國父的繼承者蔣主席亦已　决告訴過我們：中國現在最最迫切需要的是：和平，民主，統一，建設。這是橫在我們前面的惟一的路徑，也是國父所遺留給我們的惟一的付託。</p>
<h3>推廣造林運動</h3>
<p>— 吳國楨</p>
<p>造林運動原是中央規定地方建設七項基本運動之一。溯自民國十七年軍閥敉平，全國統一，訓政建設工作，於焉開始。中央鑒於一切建設工作，須從地方基本實務着手，爰經規定造林，築路，衛生，保甲識字，合作，及國貨運動，爲七項地方業建設運動，領導全國一致推行。</p>
<p>造林運動旣爲七項基本建設運動之一，在抗戰以前已有十年推行的歷史，古人有調：「一年樹毅，十年樹木」，中央爲使此項運動能够歷久不輟，以收「十年樹木」這效，更規定每年三月十二日　國父逝世紀念日爲植樹節，年年此日，全國人民一面紀念國父一面遵依國父「地盡其利」的遺敎，擴大造林宣傳，舉行造林示範，以實踐遣敎的行動，來紀念國父，比較普通紀念儀式，更有意義，更加切實。</p>
<p>說到造林運動與中國的關係，由於我國農業發達甚早，原始森林，多已闢爲農田，用人造林運動，來補天然進化之不及，至爲需要。造林的功用，不生可以培植林木增加國富，同時可以調節水旱，預防災患。至於都市方面的造林，除了上述的功用之外，兼有下述兩大作用。</p>
<p>（一）增益衛生－因爲都市人口密集，工商薈萃，塵囂姻火之盛，遠過於鄕村。一般人民的住屋，大抵閭閻櫛比，叢沓湫隘。而平日工作之地、或工廠，或商店、工餘消遺之所，或戲院，或茶樓，大都羣居逼處，有損健康，欲補此種都市畸形的缺陷，惟有多植樹木，廣設園林，以增加新鮮空氣，裨</p>
<p>（二）美化風景－都市爲國家經濟文化的中心，或供國際觀光，或供國人遊覽，均宜有美化的設計，而天然風景的培植，實爲美化的必要條件，舉如園林的栽培，行道樹的種植等等，除了增益衛生外，均兼有美化的作用。</p>
<p>上海人口稠密，工商繁薈，爲全國都市之最，自經抗戰以來，敵偽八年之蹂躪，樹木多遺毀伐，國林幾淪荒廢；本年三月十二日，爲國府還都後首屆植樹節。尤宜乘此機會，推廣造林運動，除各種籌備事宜，已由社會，工務各局約集有關機關團體積極進行外，亟盼全體市民屆時踴躍參加，爲國家培植材用，爲本身增益衛生，以舉手投足之勞，收永久無窮之益。</p>
<h3>紀念植樹節</h3>
<p>— 吳開先</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以　，我們的任務，不僅要恢復戰前一切的建設，並且要超過戰前一切的建設。主席在經濟建設方案中，曾經昭示我們：最重要的，是工業建設，並且也把造林規定在這方案以內。</p>
<p>關於工業的建設的原料，最主要的當然是鋼鐵和木材，這是工業建成的源泉。所以，要考察一個國家的富力，就要估計他國內鋼鐵和木材的產量。</p>
<p>鋼鐵蘊藏在礦地裏，我國的產量，也能佔到世界上的第四位，我們祗要有技術去發掘他，這問題比較容易解決。</p>
<p>至於木材呢，我們必須要設法培植牠，才可以增加產量，才不致於匱乏。我國產木的地域，主要的是東九省，和西南幾省，以及贛·皖·閩·湘這些地方，其他的地方，大都童山濯濯，木材的產量很少。我們要求得木材產量的增加，提倡造林，實在是一件必要而且不可稍緩的事。</p>
<p>木材的用途很廣，屬於工業的，如房屋的器材，橋樑的器材，和鐵路的枕木等，其他如造紙的紙漿，桐油等，至如供食用的，如食用的菓木等。</p>
<p>照造林學家的分類，則有實用的林木，和風景用的林木，這有待於專家的叙述，我不必加以詳細的註釋。</p>
<p>諭到造林的效用呢，工業上的用途，已如上面所說，其他的效用，如培隄，防水，調節氣候，增加雨量，對於農業止，水利上，人體上的健康，都有很大的裨益，這也是大家常議上所知道的事。</p>
<p>造林在原則上，自然是宜山地，或者是曠野的平原，在上海地區？所要提倡造林的，在市區，是要栽植園林的風景樹木，這可使稠密的城市，添着許多綠的色素，增加市容的美麗，更可使稠密的城市，得着多的養氣的調劑，增加市民的健康。在郊區呢，多權些菓木，和一些賣用的樹木，並且利用上海人才的集中，多植些樹苗，改良些樹苗，供給全國各地的採購和播種。</p>
<p>今天是植樹節，也是國父的忌辰，中央規定這日子一方面是紀念國父，，一方面指示我們，植樹在這節氣裏，是最適宜的。植樹的遝動，政府是在努力地揭倡着，指導着，而這推行普遍的責任，還是要民衆自身負起來的。並且要造林專家，和從事林業的人多加努力的。更希望農民們多加注意和努力。上海是全國最大的都市，也是人才薈萃之區，我們在一切的設施，都應該樹立先聲，造林－權樹的工作，自然也不能例外。</p>
<h3>偉人小事</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>讀書　國父生性寗靜，平居沉默寡言，惟好讀書，遇有新出書籍，其較有價值者，無不設法覓購。購得後，即以紙加包書皮，以免損污，然後捧讀。架上書籍皆分類列置，絕不紊亂。國父所購書，以地理，歷史，經濟，政治，及軍事等方面爲多，中國古範决之，小說方面則爲數殊少。</p>
<p>棋術　國父對於音樂戲劇等娛樂，俱無所嗜，惟酷好象棋，行篋中除書籍文具外，象棋及棋盤常在其中。國父與人對奕，極認眞，恒至深夜方散，棋術亦頗情，惟與胡漢民氏對奕，則恒略遜一籌。</p>
<p>起居　國父起居有節，每日淸晨六七時即離床，帳褥被枕皆親自整理，從不假手傭僕。國父好潔，每日必沐浴，內衣日必一換。居南洋時，天氣酷熱異常，但國父從不隨俗脫云外前，留居室內時亦不跣足着拖鞋。</p>
<p>食物　國父於飲食方面頗爲注意，餐用筷著，不用刀又，平日喜食菜蔬。魚肉則所用極少。烟酒絕不沾唇，惟極喜啖水菓，尤嗜者爲香蕉及波蘿兩種，居上海莫利愛路時，恒囑僕役外出購食之。</p>
<p>用語　國父平時多操廣州方言，演講時則用國語，語調緩重有序，聽者無不動容。國父英語極流利，但談話及演講時，非必要時從不出口。國父性慈和，極少燥怒，居上海時，其僕曰陳和，頗愚蠢，遇不當意時，國父或斥之日「大泡和」，但亦極少聞。「大泡和」者，粵語謂「愚蠶」也。</p>
<p>肝症　國父於十三年十一月十三日，即生辰之决日，離廣州北上，謀於北方開國民會議，求取統一和平。十二月四日抵天津，因長途勞頓，復受感冒中，肝部不適，延單診治，至年終，病勢加劇。乃扶病入京，至協和醫院施行解剖手術，知全肝已堅硬如木，肝癌之症，已至末期矣。</p>
<p>逝世　十四年三月初，國父病勢越劇，脈搏加速，多至每分鐘一百五六十次，呼吸減少，有時只十七八决。三月十一日下午，由夫人扶持，於預擬之造囑上簽名。下午曾安眠數小時，至六時半蘇醒，手足漸冷，不能多盲，惟斷續謂「和平……奮鬥……救中國……」，至十二日上午九時三十分，此一代偉人，乃與世長辭。</p>
<p>殯儀　國父逝世後，全國人民無不痛悼，出殯之日，西直門外執紼者逾二十尤人，皆痛哭失聲。國父　留時，有遺囑二：一致黨內同志，一致家屬，次年，戴傳賢氏賂中央建議：茲後每次集會時應恭讀遺囑，以誌不忘，中央通過後，即令全國遵行，以迄於今。</p>

<h3>國父病危時的中醫藥方</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>國父孫中山先生，民十三年冬北上，因患肝癌最末期，在天津北平延請中外醫師醫治，延至十四年三月十二日在北平逝世。但據北平協和醫院院長劉瑞恒二月十七日致孔祥熙轉孫先生家族暨國民黨黨員之英文報告中說明：「孫先生入本院即發覺所患為肝癌最末期，乃不治之症，經於剖割及將癌之外皮用顯微鏡考察，證明診斷為確，病狀自不好而至極不好。余等以孫先生之生存為無希望矣。」因此第二天，孫先生便由協和醫院遷到鐵獅子胡同行館（顧宅）療治。那時張靜江胡適之等便舉存中醫陸仲安診視。陸醫先進黃芪黨參一兩劑後，脚腫盡消；二十日再診，湯藥煎飲，經克禮醫生檢騐報告血液循環，漸有進步，午餐飲食，已和沒有病時一樣，而且也能够安睡七八小時。可是因為病已日深，協和醫院的報告，亦已宣告絕望。但孫先生仍以大無畏精神和病魔搏鬥，所以能够延長時間二十多天，纔長辭人世。當時陸仲安的診治處方，是給一般人們所注意的，今把他所開脈案和藥方錄下：驚惶忿怒，都傷肝經，血沸氣滯，瘀濁閉塞，轉為肝硬，由硬而疽，日久成膿，升降之機失度，血氣因之大耗。是以神倦食少，足腫消瘦，舌乾苔脫，脈洪數，按之無根。內經以肝為將軍之官，相火內寄，得眞水以涵濡，眞氣以制伏，庶可奏效。謹擬方於後，候酌。</p>
<p>石環石斛三錢　野山人參三錢　山萸三錢</p>
<p>麥冬四錢　鮮生地四錢　沙苑子三錢</p>
<p>沙參三錢　甘草二錢</p>
<p>老實說，孫先生的病，若干名醫的療治，又用鐳錠醫治了四十多小時，還沒有效果，所謂醫束手，藥石無靈的了。陸仲安的藥万，也不過是盡了人事而已。現在事隔了廿二年，把他的脈案擬方錄山，也不過給中醫界留一個紀念而已。</p>
<h3>大派頭</h3>
<p>— 法·日耳韋司作李青厓譯</p>
<p>您對於我和妻子是十分認得淸楚的，決不至於把我們倆放到那些只想用銖積寸累的方法去節省銅子兒而不想舒服一下子之列所以您聽見了我的的瑟叔叔去世留下遺產給我的時候，一定不至於因為我們在生活上大起變更而以為希奇。當時在那些和我有關的事情上面，我第一個注意之點就是用一種確定的方法離開我在法布公司做了十五年的那個職務。哈，您不用擔憂，那件事我已經用最台道理的程序辦好了，並且在那個素符人望的總經理跟前極力道了歉。這個了不得的人，並且早已很知道這件事情，所以他向我說道：</p>
<p>「我全盤答應您，好朋友。」</p>
<p>請您注意喲，自從我成了家資百萬的人，他就用「好朋友」稱呼我了。以前呢，他只簡單地稱呼我做「朋友」而已。這都是一些兒過節兒，當然，不過這却使我快活，並且證明了你居然也在社會扶梯上面多多少少升了幾級兒。</p>
<p>另外許多變動都跟着來了。我們從前住的那層公寓，對於我們的新地位成了看着就生氣的了。於是找着另一層寬大些兒的，講究些兒的公寓就丟了牠。在搬家的那天，我妻子就對我說道：</p>
<p>「為我，事情眞太多了，這兒。並且，我也不再想和從前沒錢的時候一樣，來繼續來洗鍋子和給地板上蠟了。倘若你肯，我們就用一個女工」。</p>
<p>這幾句話，在我看來是完全合理的。於是我們走到了一個職業介紹所，我妻子說明了她的需要：一個正派的並且具有自動服務的經騐無需乎有人監督的人。</p>
<p>「我明白您的意思，」介紹所的經理說，「一個曾經在上等人家做過事的熟練女用人。我明天就派她到府上來。一</p>
<p>第二犬，我們看見她來了。她名呌克樂蒂德。那是一個中等身材的婦人，不老也不少，不酏也不美，但是那副可稱平凡的臉兒，却表示一種由長期服務所得而動機不明的輕視神氣。我的妻子並沒有存惡意地向她問：</p>
<p>「您是由介紹所送來的女用人嗎？」</p>
<p>她迎忙用修正的口吻答道：</p>
<p>「我是所裏的經理對馬丹說過的女管家！」</p>
<p>介紹所裏的人真沒有弄錯我們的意思。從來沒有，大概，甚麼用人能够拿得出同樣使人注意的參考資料。證件不多，但是全體都是措詞異常得體而且由幾個列入貴族的最大的人家簽了名。</p>
<p>「我素來在聖日耳曼區做事，」她對我們說。「不幸到今日，要在那一帶找一個位置却不容易！破壞得太厲害了，這幾年以來！」</p>
<p>在最初那一向，因為克樂蒂德，我們竟有些不自在了。那不免產生一種古怪的感覺，在我們初决有一個素不相識的人住在家襄的時候。並且我認為對於那個非在一家素不相識的人家家裏過活的人，這也應當同樣產生一種古怪的感覺。但是克樂蒂德，她却已經視為故常。在我們的屋瓦底下，她像是完全自在的，遠比我們對於那層感到的好得多，理由是我們還沒有得到時間來和新的公寓弄慣。</p>
<p>除此以外，我們的女用人人錯了，我們的女管家喲－是使我們完全滿意的正如我們這樣不大被人注意的東家所能判斷的一樣，她的服務狀况是完美的。她僅僅要求過我們為她添一個擦地板的人來保持樓板的淸潔和一個零做的女裁縫來應付種種補綴的事情，這類的要求出自一個如此出衆的女用人，眞是不能拒絕的！</p>
<p>所以，克樂蒂德是一顆珍珠了！給巧是我們這種初上台獲的人所不可少的。不滿意於以一種無可指摘的方式執行任務的她，倒像是自以為負着一種向我們宣布義務的義務了。唉！抱着許多臨機應變之才知深謀遠慮之思，並且以沒有隨意公開地表列一種批評或者指導。請您注意，這裏有一個從千百個例子之中我出來的例子：我們曾經買了一套摩登的家具，在飯廳裏，從前有過並且現在還在那裏的一張可以摺疊的桌子，很漂亮，我的天。在最初的那一間，我的妻子照着自己素來的辦法，在那上面舖了一舖毯子。誰知這舖毯子在漂亮的概念上打擊了克樂蒂德。不聲不響地，她揭掉了牠。我的妻子重新又把牠鋪起來，她又重新再揭掉一次。到末了，我的妻子明白了，於是收起了這舖毯子。</p>
<p>克樂蒂德到了和她的女東家了完了這件事之后，她居然願意對我留心了。最初，我覺得這倒不錯。我可以對您自白這件事嗎，在運氣剛剛來襲盤我們的時候可一直是還沒有着過燕尾大禮服和吸烟小禮服的。這就是克樂蒂德在時機到了的時候，用深思遠虛的方法來指導我應當穿這一種或者另一種。同樣她又知道使我留心糾正某些錯誤。某次傍晚，在我們將要出去的那一忽兒裏。我還聽見她向我說道：</p>
<p>「麥薛有點兒疎忽，今天傍晚！」</p>
<p>「為甚麽，這個，克樂蒂德？」我問。</p>
<p>「因為麥薛弄錯了。麥薛穿上了燕尾服，又緊上一個黑領結。」</p>
<p>這個小的過節兒，我本來還沒有探聽過：穿上燕尾服就得繫白領結！以后，克樂蒂德繼續她的工作，嚴格遵守一種穿用黃皮鞋和花襯衣的規章，而這些過節兒，正是我素來表現得最糟的。並且道還不是她知道在我個人的趣味上所加的唯一犧牲。我還得非屏除我那種依然過於傖俗的言語不可了，並且在忸怩態度之中，放棄了我那種把飯市角兒塞到坎肩兒口上的習慣了，丟開了烟斗來吸雪茄了，丟開了白浴特的紙牌玩法來鬥橋牌了。</p>
<p>我們豈止變更了家裏那種不合於這個忠心女用人意思的食譜。而且我告您，麥薛，我們還得常常跑到菜館子裏偷着去吃某些和我們新環境不相宜的菜：倒如酸燴小牛頭，伽恩州做法的臟腑，漁人式的新鮮淡菜之類。</p>
<p>這樣被我們那個出衆的女管家展開了的多方面的努力，並不是沒有效果的。慢慢地，但也是可以保證他，我們在舒服的生活之中有進步了，大概我們很可以終於化為一對最見得人的社會的人，倘若一種意料不到的變故不來陡然危害了我們的教育。</p>
<p>某一天早上，我們空費了時間來等候克爾蒂德來做事。於是我的妻子就走到這個模範女用人的臥房裏去看她，這一個竟不在臥房裏了。動了疑心，我們就在家裏各地方兜了一個圈子：發現了我們那顆珍珠同時和我們的銀台面連着幾件首飾和其他一些擺飾一齊失踪了。……</p>
<p>您問我是不是報了案？我的天，麥薛，我應當告訴您說是沒有！我們，我和我的妻子，當時因為那件落到我們身上的事，都是那樣滿意的。（譯自法文中國郵便週刊）</p>

<p>詩，好似甘露，滋潤着我們乾涸的人生。</p>
<p>脫離了現實，吟風弄月的詩；住在象牙塔裏的詩；外形漂亮，內容貧乏的詩；這時代已經不需要她了。</p>

<h3>唐代舞裝</h3>

<h3>題女明玉所畫唐代舞裝</h3>
<p>— 朱應鵬</p>
<p>舞樂之盛稱唐時，教坊曲部體制垂。中土西域衆態宜，分曹列隊如陳師。後世文教失典儀，明時氣象隨星移，燉煌窟晝留風規，一鳞一爪想見之。邇來學者紛神馳，不遠千里臨西陲，手摹力追忘勞疲，藝壇壁壘觀新旂。須知匠手本參差，考古訂俗功可資，取法要別醇與疵，降而剽竊徒自欺。爾今機杼出新思，依傍一空非肓隨，汲古推陳端在茲，九仭一簣功母虧。</p>
<h3>遙念</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>分離才能回味到歡聚的　意、有了分離，才更珍惜起聚首的時間來。命運是無常的，它是人生的捉弄者。千萬的情意，也只能憑着心靈的融會，默默地相互遙寄。</p>
<p>你說，周圍枯躁和寂寞，像一片無垠的沙漠，看不到一點錄洲的踪跡。但是，我，也只能在你的信裏，從前的話語裏，找到一點溫暖和安尉。氣候該一天天廻蕩着春天的暖意了，然而，幾時才能照射到我們的身旁呢？</p>
<p>這是一個磨折年輕人的時代，不，磨練年輕人的時代。敏感的思想的觸　，我們正渴望着向每一方向發展出去，却都不免反射回來了失望和悲觀！——我們記得曾經勇敢地互相慰勉，不要嘆氣，這也不過更明顯地表示出內心的空虛吧了。有什麽用呢？我有把握地料想你一定還是時常</p>
<p>我們憂生命，尊敬生命，生命是荘嚴的，為了它，我們忍受了一切的代價。即使感情的熬煎是痛苦的，但是，讓淚珠的品　裏照射出光輝來，我們把希望寄託在將來。</p>
<p>掠過了漫長的時間，遙遠的空間，在孤獨的氣氛裏，我們驕傲地畢竟還並沒有孤獨。天上的浮雲月亮，脚下的親切的泥土，我們隨時藕着它們遞着相同的關懷</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血196</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這一次，一聽耀羣剛要念出這道命令，我才發現大廳上的燈光，就像換電似的，忽然閃了兩閃，一會兒又閃了兩閃。這是一種報警信號。可是，設如沒有聽到耀羣把第一次警報念出，這第二次警報，我也決不會發現，因那燈光閃動的事，北平常見，道是北平發電機太舊，常有的毛病。燈光閃動之後，我看見耀羣的限睛連速映了兩下，正是第中目光的自然準備；這才證明她並未被人催眠，（因受術人的限睛，或是圓睜，或是　上，但決不會陝動。）同時見她雙睛正注視着我們距離不遠的地面上，神情十分緊張，於是也隨着她的眼光瞧去，這才發見那地面上的燈光，陰陽分影的所在，有一點極淡的影子在閃動着，閃動的間歇，略一細心辨視，方才知道是總部的電訊。</p>
<p>這種通訊方式，裝置得極其巧妙；只須用一隻小型電鍵板，一頭接通電表總錢，一頭接在一個變壓器上，當中裝置一個電報撳鈕來控制電流，觸動這撳鈕，全部电燈，就得閃動，一暗一明。</p>
<p>但這時大廳燈光，並沒有全部顯然閃動，僅僅只在大小各種不同光度映出的陰陽分影處，細心注視，才能略路看出閃動的動作。我想大廳許多燈光中，也許只有一盞小燈，通着一雙壓器，所以閃動時，令人絲毫不覺；否則像「金司令」這種狡猾的諜探，如要全部燈光，一齊閃動起來，還能逃出她的注意？但從這一點上，也可見得耀羣的機警，眞非常人可及。</p>
<p>這邊耀羣念着電訊命令的當口，鶴見那裏，情勢忽地又突然轉變。那女司令聽了鶴見說出身份，報了姓名，本來已經由强化改作軟化，不知怎麽一來，也許是鶴見又對她開了一兩句玩笑，那傢伙熊度，忽又强硬起來。我因聽着耀羣念出電訊，又在搜索燈光閃動的來源，沒有注意到鶴見那邊變化的因由；這時只聽見那所謂「金司令」，口口聲聲逼着鶴見要身份證明，否則就要照令施行全部搜查，而鶴見却仍舊嘻皮笑臉的說着不規則而生硬的日語：</p>
<p>「搜查麼，也應該搜查！可是今天我從松井那裏來，也沒有聽見有這個「衛戍司令部」，…這個部到底是哪一方面的；是日本的？還是中國的？還是兩方面合辦的？……」</p>
<p>鶴見說到這裏，我看見那位「金司令」臉上顏色變得難看極了，可見她已經氣到了分際，只差這麽稍稍觸動一下，準可爆炸起來。他們正鬧着當口，站在我身邊的耀羣，忽地輕輕告訴我和小老虎「咱們的人都下來了！」我略略側轉頭，對大廳那些飯座一瞧，只不知道什麽時候，十幾張桌子上，都有人圜座起來，有的桌上三四人，有的一二人，連我們的大傻子「〇四」，也同手下的人，擠在一張桌上。更呌我驚奇的，這些人中，却有一桌，端端正正坐着戴先生馬君和W君。好幾個跑堂的穿花蝴蝶一般，滑行翩躚，正忙着往來各桌上，端送茶點，咖啡冷飲等。至於他舞何時來的，我因全神貫注在鶴見那邊，簡直沒有知覺。</p>

<h3>「鷄和鷄蛋」</h3>
<p>— 楊治民</p>
<p>市參議會為討論解凍生活指數問題，曾引起一塲激癖。（詳情可見本報九日本市新阳欄。）</p>
<p>但大會中有兩位議員之大聲疾呼，實令吾人有再提之必要。</p>
<p>「鷄若完了，何來鷄蛋？」這一大問題，的確是値得政府考慮的。</p>
<p>職工是鷄。生活指數是鷄的侗料，但是處在這個經濟崩潰環境下，鷄本身並不希望有白米吃，所要求的僅僅有一點能延長生命的細糠就够了。鷄畢竟還曾生蛋的。</p>
<p>反之，政府祗盼鷄生蛋，不給他最低的飼料，那麽，「何來鷄蛋？」倘使鷄蛋眞的斷絕生產了，靠鷄生存的「蛋老闆」，有將如何？</p>

<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>據聯合社八日的報導：台灣發生示威運動，由日本及海南島遣回之台灣人領導，首次表現其政冶色彩，高呼口號，，……這是多麼觸目的新聞！</p>
<p>接收台灣時沒有「騷動」，騷動却起於距接收巳一年後的現在，這並不是件偶然的事。日本人留在那裏約有用之物不是沒有，但却沒有完全利用。而從祖國帶去的是什麽呢？大旱望雲霓，望到的是什麽呢？——殘酷的暴風雨！五十年不是個短時期呀！蔣主席帶去了祖國的溫暖，然而等主席一走，當前的現實又驅走了溫暖。內心的希望是希望，事實又是事實，誰不失望？</p>
<p>「勝利後一切都有辦法」！誰都有這樣的希望，然而這「辦法」給少數人佔有了，還有什麼辦法？</p>
<p>如今事件已具「政治色彩」了，而且「示威」運動是「由日本及海南島遣回之台灣人領導」的，這究竟是怎麽回事？仁者見仁，智者見智，値得我們深思。</p>
<h3>殺狐記</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>本報昨載：本市建國路慶鮮棉織廠，因狐仙作祟，於近三日來，發生奇怪火警，損失達一萬尤五千萬元之巨，街談巷議，莫不稱奇。</p>
<p>當此原子時代，狐祟之說，斷難成立。該廠怪火，與楊營長殺狐事實，如出一轍。茲追記於下，聊作該廠偵查之參考：</p>
<p>本市尙文門外，有寺一，名不甚著，相傳有狐仙居之，求財問病，素稱靈異。香火之盛，近集遠來。二十六年秋，抗日軍雲集滬南，苦乏駐所，某營楊營長見該寺地址合宜，且敷應用，因向寺僧乞居，僧言寺有狐仙，恐難下榻，楊營長不之信，嗤以為妄，親率數動務入寺，佈置一切，楊見禪堂中，供一神位，云即狐仙，上覆天花板。油漆一新。窗明几凈，鐘聲琤琮。楊即就禈堂中書一字條，命兵士貼諸門外，定為該營駐紮處。當時了無他異，翌日，兵士開至，詎行裝甫卸，相顧驚奇，蓋何來　汁，被毯上竟巳淋漓盡致矣。寺僧合掌，謂是必大仙惡作劇，故有此異，楊仍不置信。不料三日之間，號生怪火十餘次，不特燃燒被服，即桌上文件亦能自焚。楊營長疑訝交幷，乃焚香燃燭，拜於神位前，並戒士兵，不准擅入蟬堂，擾及大仙。同時忽有一黃紙，從犬花板中，冉冉而下，上書「請駐他處，否則莫怪」八字，楊營長靈機忽動，立拔手槍，向天花板連擊數響，頓覓有血鮮紅，點滴而下，康大譯，登閣騐之，一老僧蜷伏閣上，頭胸已中彈，血流如注，死矣。楊營長始知僧人故弄狡獪，假託狐仙，俾絕借屋，褊搜寺僧，得皮張二，玻瓶一，皮囊中貯糞汁，上裝銅管，管有未塞，可左右旋，右旋則孔現，左旋則孔閉，如滴瓶然，玻瓶中有憐塊數段，已用去其半，衆怒，擬殺之，後以某紳之說項，遂置不究。</p>

<h3>「爲民前鋒」——奸僞變臉小記</h3>
<p>— 長流</p>
<p>胡適對新聞記者說，現在學生因為國家頻年戰亂，不能怪他們對政治發生興趣。這個話似乎可以引用到奸偽問題上</p>
<p>奸爲問題，在某一個時期，也即是儲備票二百作一的時期，「風聲」的確相當「緊」過一時的，因為「種子得子」，「種瓜得瓜」，替敵偽効過「犬馬之勞」的「奸偽」，自然應當得到「懲罰」。</p>
<p>但是許多奸偽正如「儲備票」一樣，經過了「二百作一」這一「轉換」的階段，大大地轉變了面目。正有點像孫行者拔根身上的「汗毛」一樣，喝一聲：「變！」把臉一抹，「猴子精」可能馬上變成個妖妖嬈嬈的十八歲大姑娘，可能變成個經過什麽競選的民意代表，甚致變成一個穿戴整齊神武顯赫的什麼「長」之流。於是心底裏被人「鄙夷」的那些「犬馬忠臣」，也都毫不在乎，在「大會如儀」的面前高呼「……萬歲」；而且也以了「儀熊萬狀」裝成領導羣倫的領袖之一，在顯露着他們的風采了。</p>
<p>舉例來說。替「日本老子」作過什麽「大東亞進行曲」的什麼烏「作曲」的「家」之流，現在也居然為着祖國在大大呻吟着「苦難的抗戰多麼艱辛」之類歌頌的曲詞了。</p>
<p>他們臉上，照樣神采奕奕，抗着「為民前鋒」的大招牌。</p>
<p>——人材缺少的時候，漢奸也可以報國呵！</p>
<p>於是譯書呵，（已在獄中的）作曲呵，導演呵，演劇呵，正是「有力出力」，「有才出才」，（才者才華也）多方輝煌的貢獻呵！</p>
<p>但主要的，我們不能忘記胡適這一提詞，祖國頻年戰亂，大家束緊褲帶都來不及，誰還關心什麽倫常，什麽道德，什麼替「日本老子」做過亡八孫子等等的什麽「奸」什麽「偽」了！</p>
<p>吃飯要緊，大家自顧不暇，於是你有數，我有數，也只能付之低徊嘆息而已。</p>

<p>一個五十歲的中年人，在會計科服務了二十個年頭，他的一生中，沒有熱烈的愛情，沒有偉大的事業，自然也沒有可供揮霍的金錢，他只是勤勤懇懇，忠於職守，平平凡凡地活着。他真是十分滿足嗎？當然不，正像他所說：「在心的深處，始終梗着一些什麼」。他說不出那是什麼，日子太久了。在他的心裏潛藏了十年乃至二士年，有一天，它面一上的灰塵突然被一陣輕風吹散，於是它又顯明突出了，它是「愛」，是「慾」，多年深藏，一且出頭，它變得更强，更有力，中年人不很容易入迷，可是一旦迷戀，其程度一定比靑年人更深，也更勤自拔。</p>
<p>為了片中有偷竊殺人等塲面，傳說甚至弄在美國也曾一度禁映，但後來終於解禁。原因是電影的拍攝，應該能反映現實，當現實生活中偷盜殺人一天不曾絕滅時，也就無法不使銀幕上有類似鏡頭的出現。</p>
<p>「長恨天」由有倫盜殺人的塲面，但是我　覺得它給了我教訓，更何况在愛德華羅賓遜和瓊裴納合演之下，在藝術上有着極大的成就，當選為名片之一，自非倖致。</p>

<h3>China's Internal Affairs Not to be Interfered With, Opposes Inclusion in Meeting Agenda - Foreign Minister Wang's Statement on the Soviet Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the Moscow Conference on the 11th:</p>
<p>Foreign dispatches report that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has suggested that the China issue be included on the agenda of the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Chinese government has not yet received any official notification regarding this matter. However, regarding this issue, the Chinese government had previously made a sincere statement in its note to the four foreign ministers, stating that the agenda of the Moscow Conference should be strictly limited to discussing the German and Austrian peace treaty issues. Any addition of other topics must be decided upon in advance through consultation among the five foreign ministers. This position of China has received the support of the British, French, and American governments, and the Soviet government, in its own note, has not expressed any disagreement on this point.</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fundamental principle that the internal affairs of any member state are absolutely not to be discussed in a foreign ministers' conference, and such issues must not become the object of agreement among other member states.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances can the Chinese government agree to include China's internal affairs on the agenda of a foreign ministers' meeting. [Another dispatch] American Ambassador Stuart R. Smith called on Minister Wang Shijie on the 11th to discuss matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] President of the Legislative Yuan, Dr. Sun Ke, stated in an interview with our agency today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's suggestion that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers discuss the China issue in Moscow is an "unfriendly act, at the very least containing an insulting attitude." Any suggestion to discuss the China issue without the participation of Chinese representatives will certainly be opposed by China. China firmly opposes any international interference in China's internal affairs, be it by the United States, the Soviet Union, or any other country. China is not an international colony. US Secretary of State Marshall's statement that the China issue should not be discussed without the presence of Chinese representatives is quite correct. When asked whether Molotov's unexpected suggestion indicated that the Soviet Union would openly support the Chinese Communists, President Sun replied, "Perhaps that is the intention, but in any case, this suggestion constitutes interference in China's internal affairs."</p>
<h3>Molotov Proposes Discussing the China Issue - Marshall Says the US Cannot Agree</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 11th Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their second meeting at 8:00 AM (Eastern Standard Time) on the 11th. Molotov rejected the suggestion that China be invited to participate in the meeting, arguing that China did not participate in the 1945 Moscow Three-Power Agreement. On the other hand, Molotov firmly demanded that the China issue be included on the agenda. Furthermore, the Soviet side stated that Marshall had in principle agreed that the foreign ministers' conference could discuss the China issue, which the US side denied on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 12th, 2:00 AM Broadcast: At the second meeting of the foreign ministers' conference, Molotov again requested a discussion of the China issue. It is reported that this foreign ministers' conference must discuss the Far East issue. If the previously agreed points can be observed, it will not only benefit US-Soviet relations but also contribute to the restoration of internal peace in China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] Secretary of State Marshall told reporters here this afternoon that the United States would oppose the four powers discussing the China issue at this foreign ministers' conference without China's participation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 10th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov dropped a diplomatic bomb at the opening session of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference today, proposing that the China issue be included on the agenda. US Secretary of State Marshall, looking surprised, immediately stated his opinion, saying that he could not express his attitude on this suggestion until the 11th, and adding that this issue could not be properly discussed without the participation of Chinese representatives. Molotov, however, believed that the participation of Chinese representatives was unnecessary. He then argued that the China issue could be included as a supplementary topic for discussion. When Molotov raised the China issue, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault remained silent. Following Marshall's suggestion, it was decided to postpone further discussion until the 11th. It should be noted that China is one of the five powers in the Potsdam Foreign Ministers' Conference, yet the Soviet Union is now insisting on excluding China from participating in any international conferences. For example, after Japan's surrender, when the first four-power conference was convened in London in September 1945, the Soviet Union was the first to refuse China's participation. At the second meeting held in Moscow, only Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union participated. China did not participate in the third meeting held in Paris to discuss the peace treaty with the Axis satellite countries, nor in the fourth meeting held in New York. As for France, although it did not participate in the December 1945 meeting, Molotov has no intention of refusing French representatives from participating in discussions on the China issue.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Proposal</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] The full text of Molotov's proposal, made at the first meeting of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, to add the China issue to the agenda is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Soviet delegation has a proposal regarding the agenda of the conference."</p>
<p>"As is well known, at the 1945 Moscow Conference, the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union agreed on the necessity for China, under the leadership of the National Government, to implement unification and democratization, to cease the civil war, and to reorganize the government on a broad basis, so that all democratic elements should be included in the various organizations of the Chinese democratic government."</p>
<p>"The foreign ministers also agreed to adhere to the principle of non-interference in China's internal affairs."</p>
<p>"Regarding the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops stationed in China within the shortest possible time after the completion of their missions, the US and Soviet foreign ministers also reached detailed agreements."</p>
<p>"However, since the 1945 Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the situation in China has not improved. Therefore, the Soviet government proposes that the foreign ministers' conference should hear a report from the participants of the previous Moscow China agreement on how they have implemented their resolutions."</p>
<p>The communique concluded by stating that US Secretary of State Marshall had "agreed to include this issue on the agenda," but he requested that it not be discussed immediately, "in order to study the procedures for discussing this issue."</p>
<h3>Opening of the Shen'an Road</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Andong, 11th] The Pan'an Railway officially reopened on the 10th, restoring the state before the 24th of last month. At 8:00 AM and 9:30 AM, two passenger trains departed from Andong Station one after another, carrying many passengers who boarded with great excitement to head west. However, this time the Shen'an route still requires two days, and passengers will inevitably have to spend a night in Gongyuan or Benxi. Direct trains will definitely be realized by the end of April at the latest.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Issues Statement - Expresses Surprise at Soviet Foreign Minister's Suggestion, Believes This Action Violates the UN Charter</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun, in his formal statement today commenting on Molotov's suggestion to include the China issue on the agenda of the foreign ministers' conference, stated: This matter is quite surprising, as the suggestion was not discussed with China beforehand. Gu stated: Non-interference in the internal affairs of a country is a principle already stipulated by international law and included in the UN Charter. Gu continued: China already does not understand why China was not included in the Moscow conference, as according to the Potsdam Agreement, China is a member of the foreign ministers' conference. However, regarding its own issues, according to international etiquette and friendship, China should have been consulted first, and in any case, any discussion regarding China should invite China to participate. Currently, the governments of the participating countries of the Moscow conference are also well aware of the strong feelings of the Chinese people on this matter. It would be inconceivable for the conference to proceed with any discussions directly related to China without China's participation.</p>
<h3>Northeast Generals Conference - Scheduled to be Held in Changchun on the 14th - Fierce Street Fighting in Jiaoxian, Shandong</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Changchun, 11th] It is reported that high-ranking generals in the Northeast are scheduled to hold a military conference in Changchun on the 14th to discuss the security of the Sui District and military issues on both sides of the Songhua River.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Changchun, 11th] On the morning of the 10th, a part of the Communist First Division and Sixteenth Division, crossing the river south from Wujiadian, were severely attacked head-on by the New First Army. The Communists suffered over 300 casualties and fled north across the river. The National Army captured 140 rifles and 8 light and heavy machine guns.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Liao Yaoxiang told reporters from our newspaper in Anshan: The Communist troops in the Northeast have undergone a month of reorganization, which may increase people's new mysterious doubts about the Communist army. However, this spring offensive by the Communist army has revealed the shortfalls. Shortcomings include failing to capture Songhua River , head fort, and failure to use new weapons. These are good examples. The National Army may not attack Harbin at present.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 11th] Military News: Communist troops are again appearing in the area northwest of Qitamu, on the south bank of the Songhua River. The National Army is currently searching along the river.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Jinan, 11th] Jiaodong important station, in the eastern section of Jiaoji, was briefly attacked by Communist troops on the evening of the 10th. It was recovered by the National Army on the morning of the 11th through a pincer attack from the east and west. In Jiaoxian, a fierce battle is unfolding. There is no change in the situation around Weixian and Changle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 11th] The Communist troops attacking Jiaoxian, Lanchun, concentrated all their strength again at 10:00 PM on the 10th, launching a fierce attack on Jiaoxian with over 20 cannons. The Jiaoxian garrison fought bloodily all night. By 3:00 AM on the 11th, the Communist troops concentrated fresh troops and launched a fierce attack on the north gate. The battle was exceptionally fierce. At 5:00 AM, over 3,000 Communist troops broke through the north gate, and fierce street fighting has now broken out with our garrison.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 11th] On the 11th, the National Army in Ningyang continued to advance north along the west side of the Jinpu Railway and recovered Anzhuang, Liangcun, Xinji, and other strongholds 17 kilometers north of Ningyang City.

<h3>Authoritative American Public Opinion Advocates for Substantial Aid to China - Hopes Our Country Will Eliminate Obstacles to Peace</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] According to diplomatic sources, the attitude of authoritative American public opinion towards the China issue seems to have undergone some changes recently. For example: (1) The New York Times editorial stated that China urgently needs US assistance, and the purpose of US assistance should be to increase the self-sufficiency and productive capacity of the Chinese people. (2) The Los Angeles Times pointed out that the CCP can only forcibly promote communism through military force, but its plunder of agricultural products and oppression of farmers runs counter to its purpose. The Chinese government only needs to implement the constitution and carry out reorganization, even without the participation of the Communist Party, and Americans believe that it will definitely make progress and are still willing to provide assistance. (3) The Chicago Daily News editorial emphasized that Chairman Chiang must first strive to unify China before he can begin his construction work, and the US policy towards China should only know to aim at assisting the construction of a new China, regardless of what obstacles it encounters, it must always persist in order to achieve thoroughness. Judging from the discussions of the above newspapers, Americans have almost become impatient with the CCP's destruction of Chinese peace, obstruction of Chinese unification, and indirectly hindering the development of international trade. Their desire for China to reorganize its government and complete unification is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 11th] Reliable sources claim that the American Committee for a Free China has today submitted a letter to President Truman and other dignitaries, urging the US government to reconsider its previous decision and allow the Chinese government to purchase military supplies and ammunition worth $75 million. The committee pointed out that after the failure of US mediation in China, the Chinese government must recover the Northeast and Taiwan. Therefore, the United States should no longer refuse to provide military equipment, which is necessary to restore domestic order and recover territory, which is what the late President Roosevelt guaranteed to China according to the Cairo Declaration.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 11th] According to a Shenyang dispatch: According to the agreement between China and the Soviet military authorities in Lushun, the Chinese government is scheduled to take over Dalian on March 15.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] There may be a new situation in Dalian and Lushun in the near future, because people in relevant circles have this argument based on (1) the grain and food in Dalian and Lushun is about to run out, and (2) the moving work in a certain area has reached a considerable extent.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Northeast Headquarters Chief of Staff Dong Yingbin, Liaoning Province Chairman Xu Zhen, and Northeast Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Su Jianfei flew to Beijing at 9:00 AM on the 11th.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes Proposal - The Ministry of Finance May Not Issue Large Denomination Banknotes - Amendment to the Commodity Tax Regulations Draft</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] At the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting this morning, after 40 minutes of heated discussion and debate, it passed the proposal of members Lou Tongsun, Tan Tiwu, Dai Xiujun, Liu Tong, and others to suggest that the Supreme National Defense Council strictly order the Ministry of Finance to immediately stop issuing banknotes with a face value of 10,000 yuan and absolutely not issue banknotes with a face value of more than 10,000 yuan. The reason for this is that the government's various efforts to stabilize prices over the years have not yet achieved the expected results. The issuance of the new customs gold coupons of 250 yuan and 500 yuan has not been long, and recently the issuance of large denominations of 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan of legal tender has been seen. The efforts to stabilize prices cannot avoid having an offsetting effect, and may even be sufficient to stimulate price increases. It is difficult to implement the original intention of the economic emergency measures program and achieve the preliminary goal of stabilizing prices and securing the market. Therefore, it is proposed to suggest that the Supreme National Defense Council strictly order the Ministry of Finance to immediately stop issuing banknotes with a face value of more than 10,000 yuan, and absolutely not issue banknotes with a face value of more than 10,000 yuan thereafter, in order to save the economic crisis. At today's regular meeting, chaired by President Sun, in addition to the above case, (1) the report of the Legal System Committee on reviewing the draft regulations on free education subsidies for the children of revolutionary anti-war meritorious people, (2) the report of the Legal System Committee on reviewing the draft amendment to Article 8 of the Organizational Law of the National Government Military Participation Office, (3) the report of the Economic Committee and the Legal System Committee on reviewing the draft amendment to the Organizational Regulations of the Technical Workers Training Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, (4) the report of the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee on reviewing the draft amendment to the various articles of the Commodity Tax Regulations, (5) The Finance Committee and the Legal System Committee reported on reviewing the draft Organization Law of the Ministry of Finance .</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The draft amendment to the various articles of the Commodity Tax Regulations was passed at the 317th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 11th. The most important point of this amendment is that the ad valorem tax rate on cotton yarn has been increased from the original 5% to 7%. The Ministry of Finance originally wanted to increase it to 10%. During the review, the legislators agreed that the ad valorem tax rate on cotton yarn was only 3.5% last year. Now, in order to increase tax revenue, it should be appropriately increased, but if it is raised to 10%, it will be too high. The decision was made to change it to 7%. During the discussion at today's meeting, Yu Zhenying opposed the increase. Finally, it was decided to pass it according to the review opinion. Liu Youchen, a new legislator and social leader, believed that the ad valorem tax on cosmetics of 45% seemed too low and advocated raising it, but after discussion, it was still passed according to the original plan.</p>

<h3>Lei Zhen Stays in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Waiting for Jiang Yun's Telegram from Hong Kong</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Lei Zhen did not travel yesterday because he was waiting for a telegram from Jiang Yuntian, and he hoped that members Wu Xianzih and Li Daming could fly to Shanghai from Hong Kong. However, if there are no other important matters, he will decide to return to Beijing today. The sole mission of Lei's visit to Shanghai this time was to urge the Democratic Socialist Party to send someone to Hong Kong to invite Wu Xianzih to Shanghai to discuss matters. Because Wu's position is important, if he does not oppose joining the government, the Democratic Socialist Party can submit a list of participation in the National Government and the Executive Yuan in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party and Jianweichu Yi An, who was released, took a plane to Hong Kong at 10:00 AM yesterday to invite Wu Xianzih and Li Daming to Shanghai to discuss the major plan of joining the government.

According to relevant sources, Wu Xianzih may come to Shanghai this time, but he strongly advocates joining the local government at the same time, and believes that joining the central government alone is an "unwise" move.</p>

<h3>The Case of Principals of All Levels of Schools - Concurrently Serving as Public Opinion Representatives - Heated Debate Erupted During the Legislative Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] A heated debate arose during the Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of the 11th when discussing the case of principals of all levels of schools concurrently serving as public opinion representatives. Situ De and others believed that the atmosphere of officials should not invade the public opinion organs, and that principals of public schools should not concurrently serve as senators, etc. Chen Hong held a dissenting opinion, believing that there were not many intellectuals in various places, and those who held the position of principal must be enlightened and prestigious people. If they were asked to resign as principals and serve as representatives, their lives would become a problem. In fact, many university presidents have served as members of the National Political Council. Why be so generous here and stingy there? Jian Guansan also believed that if there were no such enlightened people participating in the public opinion organs, they would inevitably be completely controlled by local tyrants, and that this matter involved too much and should be delayed for discussion. The majority of the audience agreed and decided to delay the discussion of the case.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Oppose Interference! Protest Insults!</h3>
<p>On the first day of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Molotov requested that the China issue be included on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference. What is the Soviet Union's intention? It is truly perplexing, not only beyond our expectations but also unanticipated by US Secretary of State General Marshall, who had to express surprise. Molotov's proposal is tantamount to throwing a bomb into the diplomatic world, shaking the peace of the entire world, not only arousing the indignation of the people of our country but also causing righteous people around the world to feel injustice.</p>
<p>When Molotov made this proposal, he explained it at the Foreign Ministers Conference, saying: "At the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union unanimously agreed that China should implement democratic politics and maintain unity under the leadership of the National Government, with the broad participation of all democratic elements in the various government agencies, and should immediately stop the civil strife; at the same time, the three foreign ministers solemnly declared their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. In addition, the US and Soviet foreign ministers also established an agreement that both countries were willing to withdraw their troops from China as soon as their obligations and responsibilities were completed, without delay. However, since then, the situation in China has not improved. Therefore, the Soviet government proposes that the representatives of all countries participating in the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference should report to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the results of the implementation of this resolution."</p>
<p>This kind of specious argument cannot stand up to scrutiny, whether legally or morally. As Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke told a reporter from the Associated Press, Molotov's proposal was "an unfriendly act, or at least an attitude that insults China." Regarding the Soviet Union's intention, let us set it aside for now and state our views from a legal perspective.</p>
<p>First, on the eve of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, our foreign affairs authorities had already notified the four foreign ministers, expressing the hope that the agenda of this Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference would be limited to European issues, and that if any agreement on China or the Far East was to be established, the consent of the Chinese government must be obtained in advance. The four governments did not express any objection to this, which can be regarded as tacit consent. Now, Molotov suddenly demands that the China issue be included on the agenda and resolutely refuses to invite Chinese representatives to participate. What reason is there to speak of?</p>
<p>Second, according to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, the so-called Foreign Ministers Conference is composed of the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. China is qualified to participate in all previous Foreign Ministers Conferences. However, as of now, China has only participated in the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference once, and that conference ended unhappily due to the Soviet Union's opposition to China's participation in discussions on European issues. China did not participate in the subsequent Second Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow, nor did it participate in the Third in Paris and the Fourth in New York due to Soviet opposition. In December of last year, US Secretary of State Byrnes advocated inviting China to attend the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, but it failed to materialize due to the Soviet Union's objections. In February of this year, when the Four Foreign Vice Ministers Conference discussed whether China should convene a meeting on the German peace treaty, the Soviet representative Gusev, disregarding the opposition of the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, insisted on his consistent position of not recognizing China as the convener of the German peace conference. All of this shows that the Soviet Union's attitude towards China not only violates the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement but also openly insults China's international status. Therefore, Molotov's proposal is a deliberate tactic to insult China.</p>
<p>Third, this Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference is fundamentally different in nature from the previous Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference. The 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference was convened after the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference ended unhappily. Its purpose was to enable the three powers to reach an understanding and coordination on all international issues, thereby opening up the stalemate in Europe and the Far East. Therefore, the issues discussed were very broad, almost touching on all post-war issues. However, the agenda of this Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference had already been decided at the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference last year, with the drafting of peace treaties with Germany and Austria as its sole topic. Now, Molotov suddenly raises the China issue, which is tantamount to neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial. Its impact will not only arouse the indignation of the Chinese people but also break the harmonious atmosphere in the international community on the eve of the conference, making this Foreign Ministers Conference even less likely to succeed. It is certainly not a wise move.</p>
<p>From this perspective, Molotov's proposal has no basis in law, needless to say. Furthermore, examining the content of his proposal reveals Molotov's specious arguments. According to the communique issued by the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, the portion concerning the China issue stipulates three points: (1) The foreign ministers of the three countries exchanged views on the situation in China and unanimously agreed that there should be a democratic and unified China under the leadership of the National Government, with the broad participation of domestic democratic elements in the various government agencies, and civil war should be stopped immediately; (2) The foreign ministers of the three countries reiterated their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs; (3) The US and Soviet foreign ministers agreed that the troops of both countries in China should withdraw from China as soon as their obligations and responsibilities were completed, without delay.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the common opinion of the foreign ministers of the three countries on China is precisely what our government and people have been hoping for day and night. The Chinese government had already been moving towards this goal of peaceful unification before the December 1945 Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and it spared no effort to seek peace and compromise, conducting peace talks with the Chinese Communists in an effort to achieve peaceful unification through political means. However, after more than a year of peace talks, they ultimately broke down due to the Chinese Communists' insistence on conditions and their ambition to seize power by force. As a result, the intended goal has not yet been achieved. However, in order to demonstrate its spirit of doing its best, regardless of the attitude of the Chinese Communists, the government continues to move towards this goal. Now, apart from the Chinese Communists and the Democratic League, most of the domestic democratic elements have joined the government, and "the broad participation of domestic democratic elements in the various government agencies" will soon be fully realized.</p>
<p>As for the second level, the foreign ministers of the three countries solemnly declared their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. We must point out that Molotov's proposal is clear evidence that the Soviet Union has failed to fulfill this promise. The Chinese people have their own way of solving the China problem and do not need Molotov to worry about it. As for our country's request for the United States to mediate, it was out of our country's own free will, so we welcomed the United States to China to mediate. When it declared that it would give up mediation, we did not force it. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as the United States interfering in China's internal affairs. Now, at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, our foreign affairs authorities have already stated that they do not want the China issue to be included on the agenda, but the Soviet foreign minister insists on raising it and resolutely refuses to allow Chinese representatives to participate in the discussion. Is this not interfering in China's internal affairs? How can it be confused with the United States mediating in our domestic disputes?</p>
<p>Regarding the last point, the US troops stationed in China have gradually completed their mission and have already been withdrawing from China in batches. What about the Soviet troops? Not only has their mission long been completed, but their withdrawal from China should also have been implemented long ago. However, the Soviet troops in Lushun and Dalian remain stationed there! Therefore, we must point out that the country that has violated the declaration of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference is not the United States, but the Soviet Union itself!</p>
<p>In short, why does the Soviet Union want to oppose our country's participation in international conferences everywhere? Why does Molotov dare to insult China to this extent? These questions are certainly worth our deep reflection and vigilance. However, the Soviet Union's repeated insults to its former allies are absolutely intolerable to the people of our country. Although we cherish the friendship between China and the Soviet Union very much, we cannot accept insults submissively. Therefore, we must loudly call out: Oppose international interference and protest Molotov's insulting attitude, so that the Soviet authorities can also understand that the national spirit of China cannot be humiliated!</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Formulates Measures for the Disposal of Foreign Deposits, Encouraging Depositors to Report to the Government Voluntarily</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 11th] The issue of using private deposits abroad has been addressed by the Ministry of Finance, which has formulated measures and submitted them to the National Defense Supreme Committee. Once the National Defense Committee approves them, they will be promulgated and implemented. It is learned that the principle of these measures is to encourage depositors to voluntarily report to the government within three months after the measures are promulgated, then apply to foreign banks, and immediately deposit the original currency into the Central Bank of China domestically. If depositors have legitimate needs, such as purchasing production machinery, starting businesses, or for their children to study abroad and travel expenses, they can apply to the government for approval and withdrawal in accordance with legal procedures. At the same time, the measures also stipulate penalties for depositors who fail to report within the specified time limit. It is also learned that the total amount of our deposits abroad may exceed US$300 million, with the largest amounts in North and South America, followed by the United Kingdom, and then Switzerland and other countries.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting: Both Serious and Humorous - A Record of the Debate on the Suspension of Issuing Large Denomination Notes, Lou Tongsun's Impassioned Speech, Zhou Yizhi's Humorous Anecdotes</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 11th] The proposal to suspend the issuance of large denomination notes (10,000 yuan) was raised at the routine meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 11th, sparking an interesting debate that led the entire venue to argue over this important issue concerning people's livelihoods in an atmosphere that was both serious and humorous. Some members, due to differing opinions, glared at each other and refused to yield. Finally, thanks to the calm analysis and impassioned speech of Lou Tongsun, the original proposer, it was passed by a majority vote.</p>
<p>This important proposal was jointly submitted by twelve legislators. After the proposal was raised, Lou Tongsun, the original proposer, explained that the government's issuance of large denomination notes had its own financial reasons, but one of the reasons was that the printing cost of 1,000 and 2,000 yuan notes was too high. However, we should point out that the impact of the state's suffering for printing small denomination notes is insignificant compared to the economic losses suffered by the people due to the issuance of large denomination notes. People often rely on intuition to deal with economic problems, and large denomination notes are enough to stimulate people's minds, so they should be issued with caution. Lou also pointed out that Dai Xiujun and others had suggested that the Legislative Yuan formulate an issuance law to limit the amount of legal tender issued.</p>
<p>Dai Xiujun then spoke, explaining that while there is a need for the rule of law in politics, there should also be the rule of law in economics. If an issuance law can be formulated, it can have a great stabilizing effect.</p>
<p>At this point, the opposition faction rose to refute. Wang Yuxiang pointed out that large denomination notes are convenient to carry and the printing cost is also low. In this era of malignant inflation, the issuance of large denomination notes is not a major problem.</p>
<p>Chen Xiaocen believes that the main problem at present is how to balance the budget. Without this plan, simply starting with the suspension of issuing large denomination notes is tantamount to burying one's head in the sand.</p>
<p>Zhou Yizhi told a "joke" to illustrate the convenience of large denomination notes. He claimed that recently, four or five people went to a dance hall in Shanghai, expecting that less than one million yuan would not be enough to enjoy themselves. They felt it was inconvenient to carry, so they planned to pack it in a small box and carry it by car. After dancing, the driver would count the money and pay the bill. If there were large denomination notes, this would not happen.</p>
<p>Wei Tingsheng also believes that this proposal is a "stopgap measure among stopgap measures," tantamount to removing the patient's thermometer from the bedside for fear of stimulating the patient.</p>
<p>Chen Ruxuan and others disagreed, pointing out, "If it is said that this move is burying one's head in the sand, then issuing banknotes without reserves is not even more of a case of burying one's head in the sand?" If this proposal can be adopted by the government, it will surely have the effect of stabilizing people's minds. There is no reason to oppose it hastily."</p>
<p>Lou Tongsun rose again to speak, refuting Yizhi and others' argument about convenience of carrying, pointing out that one should not be greedy for personal convenience and ignore the adverse psychological impact it has on the national economy. During the War of Resistance, the story of the issuance of 500 yuan notes affecting people's minds and stimulating prices is something that those who were in the rear at the time should remember. Even in recent events, the issuance of 250 yuan and 500 yuan Customs Gold Units (關金券) ultimately led to the recent surge in gold prices. These tragic lessons should not be forgotten. We must not fail to do this just because it is "a small good thing." We should do everything that is beneficial to daily economic phenomena, let alone something that is so easy to do?</p>
<p>Zhong Tianxin cited the situation in Shantou and Guangzhou to explain that many places across the country still use small denomination notes. In Shantou today, you can still rent a foreign house for 3,000 yuan and hire a nanny for 5,000 yuan a month. Our vision should encompass the whole country, and remote locations should also be taken into account. We should not only pay attention to Beijing and Shanghai. We should know what kind of impact the issuance of large denomination notes will have on countless ordinary people across the country.</p>
<p>At this point, the members scrambled to speak, with three or five people standing up at the same time, either glaring or clenching their fists. President Sun could only smile at this.</p>
<p>Finally, Lou Tongsun put forward his most powerful argument, explaining that national credit depends on the amount of currency in circulation. If it is constantly increasing, it will not only lose its stabilizing effect but also destroy national credit itself. He also said that this proposal has positive significance in its negative aspects, because if the government adopts it, those in power will not spend extravagantly.</p>
<p>The discussion reached this point, and it was already twelve o'clock. The president then announced the vote, and the result was that it was passed by a majority of forty-four votes.</p>

<h3>Second Day of Foreign Ministers' Conference Reviews Allied Control Council Report; US Suggests Reducing European Occupation Forces</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] The four foreign ministers held their second day of meetings this afternoon and immediately reviewed the report submitted by the Allied Control Council for Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] The four deputy foreign ministers met at 10:00 AM (Moscow time) this morning to review the 700-page report of the Allied Control Council for Germany, in order to save the time of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. At Marshall's request, the deputy ministers will prepare a concise outline of the report for use in today's Foreign Ministers' Conference. The representatives present were Vyshinsky (Soviet Union), Murphy (United States), Strang (United Kingdom), and Couve de Murville (France). Meanwhile, the four foreign ministers' representatives also met today on the Austrian question, attended by Gusev (Soviet Union), Clark (United States), Baaris (France), and Hoot (United Kingdom).</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 10th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference opened today and reached an agreement on dissolving Prussia, the cradle of German militarism. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov then first raised the China issue, advocating its inclusion on the agenda (see page one). Marshall indicated that he would not be able to give a definite answer until Tuesday. Marshall later suggested that the conference should discuss the issue of limiting the number of Allied occupation zones in Europe. Molotov replied that since Marshall needed 24 hours to give a definite answer on the China issue, he would also need 24 hours to answer on the suggestion of limiting occupation forces. The meeting lasted 40 minutes, and the four foreign ministers agreed to adopt the six agenda items decided upon at the New York Foreign Ministers Conference. The first item to be discussed was the report of the Allied Control Council for Germany, and the last item was the Austrian question. The representatives of the four foreign ministers decided to discuss the most appropriate way to review the Allied Control Council report on Tuesday morning, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference was scheduled to convene every day at 1:00 PM standard time (9:00 PM Shanghai time). The issue of Prussia and another suggestion to discuss the report of the Trieste Free Territory Financial Committee at an early date were both proposed by the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The meeting place, the Aviation Club, is a white building located on a tree-lined avenue. Entering the building is a marble hall with ten giant pillars on both sides, followed by a lounge, and then the conference room. The seats of the representatives of each country at the conference table were arranged as follows: Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky; Foreign Minister Molotov; interpreter; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev; Dulles, advisor to the US delegation; Cohen, Counselor of the State Department; Marshall, Counselor of the State Department; Assistant Bohlen; US Ambassador Smith; Murphy, Political Advisor to the US Military Government in Germany; Alphand, Director of the External Economic Affairs of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Couve de Murville, Director of External Political Affairs; Foreign Minister Bidault; French Ambassador Jaddru; Haduven, Political Advisor to the French Military Government; British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson; Baquan, Director of External Economic Affairs; Foreign Secretary Bevin; interpreter; Bevin's private secretary Dixon; and Lord Hoot. More than 30 experts and staff members sat behind Molotov.</p>
<h3>Molotov's Proposal Surprises US Officials; US Congressman Judd Criticizes Soviet Overreach</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Washington officials today believe that Molotov's suggestion to include the situation in China on the formal agenda is indeed surprising. US Representative Judd stated that he opposes submitting the China issue to the Moscow conference. He pointed out that agreements on China were reached at the 1945 Moscow Three-Power Conference and the Yalta Conference, but these agreements, especially the Dalian case, have been severely violated. Judd stated that there is no reason to discuss the China issue in Moscow. All that is needed is for the Soviet Union to implement its previous agreements. China has fought for many years to achieve independence in its diplomacy. It is strange for the China issue to be discussed by the four powers. If they really do so, then they are overstepping their bounds.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 11th, Special Dispatch] American radio commentators today were the first to comment on Molotov's raising the China issue at the Moscow conference. They believe that the Soviet Foreign Minister's move is aimed at putting his opponent, the United States, in an awkward position, thereby enhancing the Soviet Union's "bargaining" position. In the European issue, Molotov personally felt the embarrassment caused by issues such as German reparations and reducing occupation forces. Therefore, he raised the China issue today as a "bargaining" chip. Molotov also seems to be buying time because he first needs time to observe the final decisions of the US government and Congress on the Mediterranean and the Middle East (especially Greece and Turkey), and the reactions of various countries to the decisions made by the United States, before deciding what kind of demands or concessions the Soviet Union should make in the peace treaties with Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] French radio commentators here recently analyzed Molotov's motives for the proposal on the China issue, believing that there are three goals: (1) to put the Soviet Union in a favorable position when the China issue is brought to a head; (2) to make the United States admit its failure in mediation in China; (3) to prepare the foundation for a round-table conference to solve this issue.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia and Poland Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty; Stipulating a Validity Period of Thirty Years</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Czech Capital, 10th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that Czechoslovakia and Poland signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries in Warsaw today. Its main purpose is to ensure the security and defense of the two countries against the threat of Germany. In addition to signing the treaty, the representatives of both sides also signed an appendix today, with three main points: (1) Both parties agree to resolve existing territorial disputes within two years; (2) The two countries will conclude economic and cultural agreements in the near future; (3) Both parties provide promises to ensure the rights and free development of the Czech minority in Poland and the Polish minority in the Czech Republic on a reciprocal basis. The treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries has a validity period of twenty years.</p>
<h3>Foreign Guests' Strange Costumes Arouse Great Interest from Russians; Used to Eating Rationed Food, They Now Dare to Feast</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] The British and French representatives at the Foreign Ministers' Conference are arousing interest among the Russians. British costumes are particularly striking in Moscow. They wear brown uniform coats, similar to those often worn by Soviet chauffeurs, with white fur hats, like shepherds from the Caucasus. In the eyes of the Russians, the British look like actors who have just come off stage from the opera house. Most Russians travel far to the city center just to see them. Fortunately, Bevin, the head of the British delegation, does not dress like his staff members. He wears a gray old coat and a narrow-brimmed, dented hat, which conforms to the image of a diplomat in the minds of ordinary Russians. Most members of the British delegation are used to eating rationed food at home. When they come to Moscow, they gorge themselves, attracting the attention of the restaurant waiters. A Moscow hotel waiter said, "The food shortage in Britain must be more severe than elsewhere. You can tell just by watching these people devour their food." What is noteworthy about the French delegation are the female staff members and stenographers. They wear wide trousers, leather jackets, and no hats, running across the cold streets. A Russian said: "If you combine these women with the British delegation, they become a perfect masquerade troupe."</p>
<h3>US Decides to Remain in Korea Until the Mission is Completed; State Department Assistant Clarifies Policy on Radio</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Detroit, 10th] Hiltring, Assistant Secretary of the US State Department, stated in a radio broadcast today that in the US-occupied zone in Korea, we will clearly show to North Korea, the Soviet Union, and other countries around the world what achievements the American democracy will have in the economic, political, and social reconstruction of a country that has suffered forty years of slavery. The United States is sincere in providing assistance to the democratic people who hope for true freedom and independence. This is obvious to all the Korean people. The problems that we must deal with in Korea constitute a fierce challenge to the United States. It would be a big mistake for the United States to ignore the situation in Korea. The struggle for control of Korea was the main cause of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. Japan gained a base to invade Northeast China by controlling Korea, and advanced step by step, eventually attacking Pearl Harbor. In order to prevent Korea from becoming a base for future aggression again, we must make Korea a free, democratic, and autonomous country. This is a factor in maintaining stability in the East. The plan that the United States intends to implement in Korea requires the patience of the Korean people. The United States must find a new basis for its understanding with the Soviet Union. In short, the US plan can be summarized as follows: (1) Reviving Korean industry; (2) Developing Korean commerce; (3) Educating the Korean people.</p>
<p>Artificial Boundaries Must Be Broken</p>
<p>Hiltring continued: The Moscow Agreement of 1945 stipulated that Korea be divided into two zones. This boundary was originally intended as a temporary measure. However, today, ten months later, this artificial and temporary boundary still exists, like a stone wall hindering the unification of Korea. The United States and the Soviet Union also have major differences of opinion on the establishment of a temporary government in Korea, because the two sides have different interpretations of the word "democracy". The United States believes that representatives of all Korean parties should be consulted, while the Soviet Union believes that all Koreans who oppose the Moscow Agreement should be excluded. However, although the unification of Korea has failed, the US government has not been discouraged and remains resolutely optimistic. We will remain in Korea until the walls of suspicion are destroyed and the new Korea is politically independent and economically self-sufficient.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Fu Bingchang Meets with Bidault and Smith</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 11th] Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Fu Bingchang, paid a visit to French Foreign Minister Bidault and US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith this morning. Each meeting lasted about half an hour.</p>
<h3>Palestine Issue</h3>
<p>British and American Foreign Ministers to Hold Consultations</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] Regarding the Palestine issue, officials have announced that the British Foreign Secretary intends to meet separately with US Secretary of State Marshall to discuss this issue. The British representative to the Security Council, Cadogan, will notify Foreign Secretary Bevin of any news related to the Palestine issue at any time.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 11th] UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie yesterday assigned the staff of the secretariat of the Palestine issue study committee. As for the organization of the committee itself, it is expected that Lie will propose that it be composed of the five permanent members of the Security Council, namely China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, and three non-permanent members, namely Brazil, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden.</p>
<h3>US Controls Atomic Program; Returned to Atomic Energy Commission for Discussion; Soviet Amendments Rejected in Security Council</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, New York, 10th] The United Nations Security Council decided today to order the Atomic Energy Commission to promptly draft detailed rules for the atomic energy control plan and to complete the report by September 16. The amendments proposed by the Soviet Union have been rejected. US Representative Austin and Soviet Representative Gromyko debated the wording of the instruction for an hour before the representatives voted unanimously to return this difficult issue to the Atomic Energy Commission. According to Gromyko, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, he needs to give this matter careful consideration before deciding when to convene the first meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission. Earlier, Austin gave a 20-minute speech, accusing the Soviet Union's proposal to control atomic energy would create a competition in atomic armaments and would cause war. Austin changed his past optimistic attitude and spoke in a depressed tone: The Soviet Union's atomic energy plan will inevitably be opposed by the United States because this plan cannot guarantee security in a positive sense, and it is sufficient to cause mutual distrust and war in a negative sense. The Soviet Union's suggestion to destroy atomic weapons before organizing an international investigation agency cannot prevent the competition of atomic weapons. Austin spoke in an optimistic tone when requesting the Security Council to return the entire issue to the Atomic Energy Commission: When the committee completes the technical details, some serious conflicts of opinion may be resolved. Austin absolutely denied that the United States had any intention of monopolizing atomic energy. French Representative Parodi complained that Gromyko raised too many "exceptions" to the US plan, which caused the current problems. Parodi also said that Gromyko not only criticized the United States, but also criticized all the representatives of the committee who passed the US proposal with a vote of ten to zero. The new council members of the Security Council, Belgium and Colombia, also made their first speeches today, stating that they both agreed with the US proposal.</p>
<p>Lilienthal to Head US Atomic Energy Commission</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] The Senate Atomic Energy Committee today approved the appointment of Lilienthal as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission by a vote of eight to one.</p>
<h3>Soviet National Defense Expenditure Huge; Accounts for One-Third of the Total Budget</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Military experts in this area analyzed the Soviet Union's national defense budget for this year, believing that the actual number will account for one-third of the government's total expenditure (equivalent to US$74.28 billion), rather than 18%, equivalent to US$13.4 billion, as claimed by Moscow Radio. To analyze the Soviet budget, it is necessary to pay attention to two facts: (1) Items that should be included in military expenditure in the US budget are included in non-military expenditure items in the Soviet Union; (2) Because the Soviet Union implements a controlled economy, the purchasing power of its budget expenditure is higher than that of other governments. There are other points worth noting: (1) A large part of the elite national defense forces may be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, with an expenditure of US$2.83 billion. (2) At least US$1.3 billion of the scientific research fund is used for military purposes; (3) In addition to federal expenditure in the budget, each republic of the Soviet Union stipulates military expenditure separately; (4) The construction of military facilities is said to be handled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and political prisoners and prisoners of war are conscripted on a large scale without paying wages; (5) The heavy industry budget includes the cost of manufacturing military weapons; (6) Military uniforms and other similar military supplies are also included in industrial expenditure; (7) The agricultural budget includes a portion of military rations.</p>
<h3>Truman and Congressional Leaders Carefully Discuss the Middle East Situation; Will Clearly Explain US Policy on Greece</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] President Truman is scheduled to deliver a speech at a joint session of the House and Senate tomorrow, in which he will clearly state the US attitude toward the entire Middle East region where communism is attempting to expand its influence, including the aid to Greece and aid to Turkey plans. Prior to this, the President consulted with key members of both major parties in Congress to seek their support. This speech by the President will be the first public statement since receiving the British note and Greece's emergency plea for help. It is expected that the President will propose to lend US$250 million to Greece to support its government and to transfer the surplus US military supplies in Germany to strengthen the Greek army to fight against the communist-trained guerrillas.</p>
<p>The President may also propose to lend Turkey the same amount of money when necessary. According to a member of Congress, the United States may give Turkey a loan of 150 million US dollars, part of which can be used to purchase the surplus US military supplies in Europe. Some members of Congress also expect that the President will ask Congress to allow the same military and financial assistance to Italy. The decision of Congress on the President's proposal will have a very significant impact on the future, and its importance may be comparable to the decision of the United States to abolish the Neutrality Act and pass the Lend-Lease Act before entering the war.</p>
<h3>Britain Cancels Greek Debt</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 11th] British Ambassador to Greece Norton informed the British government today, stating that Greece does not need to repay the value of 50 million pounds of food supplied to Greece by the British government through the British army.</p>
<h3>Bomb Thrown Immediately After Speech; Philippine President Narrowly Escapes Assassination; A Barber Arrested and Confesses to Assassination Attempt</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 11th] Philippine President Roxas delivered a speech in the central square of the city last night, approving the "Equal Treatment Amendment" when he was suddenly assassinated by someone throwing a grenade. Forty-five minutes after the incident, the police arrested a suspect, Quirino. The grenade landed next to the President's feet, but fortunately, other officials quickly kicked it three yards away. It exploded without injuring the President and others, but seven people, including the head of the guard, Colonel Tanto, were injured.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 11th] Hernandez, the acting chairman of the Philippine Labor Organization Congress and chief editor, was arrested today on suspicion of being involved in Quirino's assassination of President Roxas.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 11th] Quirino, the assassin who attempted to assassinate President Roxas, has fully confessed. Quirino, 50 years old, a barber, confessed in Bilibid Prison this morning that he was sitting under a palm tree about ten yards away from the podium. The grenade was hidden in a peanut bag. When the peanuts were finished, he decided to throw it, but unfortunately, his wrist trembled, and the target was not completely accurate. He originally bought an automatic pistol, but the pistol was stolen a few days ago, and then he obtained two grenades, the source of which is unknown.</p>
<p>According to the police, Quirino originally planned to act during the President's parade and speech in Lucena over the weekend, but later changed his plan midway. The police also escorted Quirino to the scene of the incident to reenact the crime, and then took him to meet Roxas. It is reported that Roxas asked why he did this, and Quirino replied that he believed that the President could not fulfill his past promises, and the country's economic corruption was obviously the responsibility of the President. He regretted that this wish was not fulfilled, and if he had the opportunity, he would try again. It is not yet known whether Quirino has any relationship with the Philippine opposition.</p>
<p>Roxas Talks About Assassination</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 11th] President Roxas said yesterday in a lighthearted tone that after the assassin pulled out the pin of the grenade, he waited for a short time and threw it out, causing it to not explode immediately upon landing. At that time, he was lighting a cigarette when he suddenly saw a smoking grenade thrown onto the podium, only a few feet away, and he knew he was in danger. The commander of the military police had jumped in front of him to protect him, and the Speaker of the Senate kicked the grenade off the stage and shouted "Get away!"</p>
<h3>Manila Voting Results Announced in Favor of Granting Equal Rights to the US</h3>

By a majority of three to one, they approved granting Americans equal rights for 27 years to engage in industrial and economic development in the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Responds to US Note</h3>
<p>Denies Soviet Interference in Hungarian Internal Affairs</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 11th, Broadcast: The US government recently sent a note to the Soviet Union, opposing Soviet interference in Hungarian internal affairs.

It is reported that the Soviet government believes that it was not the Soviet Union that interfered in Hungarian internal affairs, but the United States. The wording is very strong.</p>
<h3>US Navy Department Announces Start of Officer Reductions</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] The US Navy Department announced today that it has begun to eliminate 6,000 officers to reduce the number of naval officers to 46,000.

The Navy Department's announcement did not mention that Congress is currently considering the possible elimination of naval expenditures.</p>
<h3>Riots in Punjab Province Not Yet Over; Situation in India Remains Serious; Murder and Arson Cases Continue to Emerge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lahore, 10th] Riots have re-emerged in Punjab Province, with at least 550 people killed last week, a senior official said. The situation will be even more serious on the 12th, which is "Anti-Partition Day."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lahore, 10th] Near Amritsar, Punjab Province, Muslims and Hindus and Sikhs fought each other again. The army opened fire to suppress the fighting, killing four people.

<h3>Indonesian Army Breaks Dike; Area Around Surabaya Becomes a Marsh</h3>
<p>[Reuters] Tjirilen to Return to Batavia to Mediate</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 11th] According to news received from Batavia today, in the conflict between the Dutch army and the Indonesian army, the Indonesian army used the tactics of breaking the dikes and releasing water, forcing thousands of people to evacuate from the flooded area. A large area near Surabaya has been flooded, and 20,000 acres of rice have no hope of harvesting. According to a Dutch military spokesman, the Dutch are currently negotiating with the Indonesian authorities to stop part of the dike-breaking and water release in Semarang. In Surabaya, the native army, possessing machine guns and Japanese cannons, is said to have penetrated into the Dutch military area.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] According to reliable sources: British Special Envoy to Southeast Asia Gillean may return to Batavia to mediate the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia. Gillan will strive to reconcile the differences in interpretation of the terms of the Linggadjati Agreement between the two sides.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Begins Debate on Economic Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The House of Commons today began debating the economic plan. The Minister of Commerce, Cripps, spoke on behalf of the government, announcing two major changes in the design of the British industrial economy: first, to strengthen the staff of the economic design; and second, to ensure measures for industrial design cooperation. In the future, all government-related industrial matters will have a dedicated economic design department attached. In addition, a joint design department will be established to coordinate design agencies among various departments. The government will also suggest that labor and management organizations send delegations to meet with government design department officials. He also stated that the government currently has no intention of adopting a large-scale discounted regulatory plan to force exports to be dumped in stable markets, as long-term markets should not be abandoned. Similarly, exports from the Sterling Area will not be shifted to the Dollar Area. The chance of inflation is currently very high, so production must increase, and working hours must not be shortened or wages increased, otherwise the country's position will inevitably worsen. In short, adopting a democratic design to establish a solid foundation for industry and raise the living standards of the people is the nation's top priority.</p>
<p>Conservative Party Member and former Minister of Production in Churchill's cabinet, Lyttelton, criticized the government's controls for failing to be concise and effective, and also criticized the huge deficit in the budget. He finally predicted that national bankruptcy was not far off, and that the people's living standards might fall again by forty percent.</p>

<h3>Fire in the Vast Slums of Zhabei Destroys 160 Shanties, Simple Construction and Incompetent Firefighters, One Child Dies Tragically, Hundreds Homeless</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The area of Baochang Road, Zhongxing Road, and Xiangshan Road in Zhabei was engulfed in a major fire yesterday afternoon. More than 160 shanties were reduced to ashes, and 500 to 600 victims wailed in the streets, a truly tragic scene. A six-year-old child named Chen Zhiyong died in the fire. In addition, Dai Awu was injured and immediately sent to the Municipal Fourth Hospital, where he was bandaged and discharged.</p>
<p>The shanties belonged to the 44th Bao of Zhabei. The destroyed houses covered more than four jia. The fire area was as large as 800 square feet, stretching from Baochang Road in the west to Saitong Road in the east, Zhongxing Road in the north, and Xiangshan Road in the south. This vast slum was reduced to scorched earth in less than two hours.</p>
<p>The fire started at the Shanghai School Equipment Company at the corner of Baochang Road and Zhongxing Road at 2:50 PM. Because all the buildings there were mostly wooden sheds and grass huts, and there were many timber yards interspersed among them, once a fire broke out, it quickly spread everywhere and was difficult to put out. Although the Xinzha, Hongkou, and Central fire departments dispatched six fire engines to the scene, they were unable to do anything because the fire had already become a raging inferno. However, the firefighters still bravely went deep into the fire and poured water everywhere. However, the flames rose and fell unpredictably, making the situation extremely dangerous. Because the firefighters went too deep, seven leather belts were pressed into the fire and could not be pulled out. The intensity and speed of the fire's spread can be seen from this.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fire, residents tried to put it out themselves, but it was ineffective because the houses were mostly made of flammable materials. By the time the fire department's observation post discovered it, the fire had already become too large to control.</p>
<p>At that time, the residents of the shantytown were in chaos, with the elderly, weak, women, and children all panicked, shouting for help and crying. The sound was heart-wrenching.</p>
<p>During the fire, Chen Zhiyong, the six-year-old son of Chen Wanshun Timber Yard at No. 1 Zhongxing Lane, was trapped by the fire and unable to escape. When he was found near the wall of No. 44, he had already been burned to a crisp, his abdomen ruptured and intestines flowing out, a truly tragic sight.</p>
<p>Among the victims, the Chen Fugi Timber Yard suffered the greatest losses. In addition to all the timber being burned, there was also a truck that could not be driven out in time and was destroyed. The estimated loss was 150 million yuan.</p>
<p>The North Station Branch sent a large team of police officers and the 3rd Squadron of Volunteer Police to maintain order at the fire scene. At the same time, He Quan, the Director of the Cha Branch, and Zhou Zhaoxiang, the Director of the Fire Department, also personally supervised the scene. When it was determined that the fire was started by Yin Jiasheng of the Shanghai School Equipment Company, Yin had already fled in fear of punishment.</p>
<p>The fire gradually died down at 4:10 PM, as there was nothing left to burn, but the cries and wails of the women and children remained unabated.</p>
<p>The volunteer police found a gold ring weighing two qian in the fire, engraved with the words "Zhang Shunyin." There was also a watch and a bicycle. All of these are currently stored at the headquarters of the Volunteer Police at No. 28 Jiaotong Road. The owners can go to the team leader, Lu Wenlong, to claim them.

<p>Student Movement to Protect Rights Officially Issues Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>Since more than 50 professors from Fudan University and other universities in this city initiated the movement to protect rights, teachers and students from various schools have responded, and all sectors of society have unanimously supported it. It is reported that all middle and university students in Shanghai have officially organized the Shanghai Student Patriotic Movement to Protect Rights. This patriotic movement will expand even further, and the association has issued a declaration, which reads in part: "We cannot sit idly by while the loss of rights and national humiliation are repeatedly inflicted upon our motherland. We should not only demand that the Allied countries withdraw their troops stationed in China, return all sovereign territories, and return all plundered materials, but we should also prevent new imperialists from interfering in our internal affairs. We demand that the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference stop discussing Chinese issues and stop using various means to threaten and influence any party in our internal strife. China's internal affairs should be resolved by our own government. We oppose any international interference."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Has the Most Fires in the Country</h3>
<p>According to the fire statistics released by the Police Bureau's Fire Department, Shanghai has become the city with the most fires.

According to statistics, since the Fire Prevention Publicity Week from November 25th to 29th of last year, the total number of fires that have occurred in Shanghai up to yesterday is 47, an average of three fires per day, with each fire destroying anywhere from a few houses to hundreds of houses. The number of fires in the past year was 1,063, which seems slightly better than this year's situation.</p>

<h3>Improving the Fire Department Organization: Ten Key Points Formulated, Equipment worth 7 Billion Yuan to be Added, 1,000 Recruits to be Collected Within the Year</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang's statement to reporters yesterday, the plan to improve the city's fire department organization has been drafted and approved by Police Bureau Director Xuan Zhaowu, and is now being submitted to the Mayor for review. The improvement plan includes the following ten key points: (1) Reorganize the fire department, abolish the current fire department headquarters, and have the fire department directly responsible for fire rescue work from now on. (2) Improve the treatment of firefighters, requesting an average increase of 30 percent, with the length of service as the basis for salary. Drivers of fire trucks should be treated the same as drivers of the Public Utilities Bureau, with no discounts on their salaries and benefits. The municipal government should also consider subsidizing meal expenses. (3) Add fire-fighting equipment, hoping to have a budget of 7 billion yuan. The source of this money is currently uncertain, but if possible, it will be collected from citizens. (4) Plan to purchase 200 million yuan worth of spare parts for fire-fighting equipment. (5) The uniforms of each firefighter should be increased to four sets per person for replacement. (6) The monthly amount of gasoline for the fire department should be increased from 1,500 gallons to 2,500 gallons. (7) The city government should subsidize the cost of miscellaneous items such as soap and copper polish. (8) The cost of repairing the Taiping hydrants by the British Concession Water Company last year was approximately 100 million yuan, which the city government should repay as soon as possible to ensure future safety. (9) Increase the number of volunteer fire brigades. By the end of this year, it is planned to recruit 1,000 police fire brigade members, assisted by the Bao Ri Office, hoping that one person from each Jia can participate. (10) Provide spiritual training to the current officers of the fire department to enhance their spirit of service. It is also planned to recruit 200 new police officers in the near future to strengthen the fire department organization.</p>
<h3>Execution Ground Prepared, Awaiting Orders for Execution</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Chang Yuqing, the old-time traitor and head of the Huangdao Association, was previously sentenced to death by the High Court. Chang appealed to the Supreme Court for review, which has been rejected. According to Du Baoqi, the Chief Prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, yesterday, the order for Chang's execution is imminent. The High Court has prepared the execution ground in recent days. To avoid mentally stimulating Chen Chunpu, Fu Shishuo, and others who have already been sentenced to death, the execution will not be carried out in the tea garden behind the detention center, but in the open space on the east side of the prison. In addition, the prosecutor has completed the investigation of Chang's property, so Chang's final fate can be decided within days.</p>
<p>Chang Yuqing's death is approaching</p>
<h3>The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office Requests the Establishment of a Deputy Director</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Liu Gongyun, Director of the China Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office, also serves as the Vice President of the Central Bank and Director of the Bank's Business Bureau, making his official duties even busier and unable to attend to the affairs of the Clearance Office.

<h3>Chen Sancai Sacrifices Himself for Righteousness, Please Sentence Two White Russians to the Ultimate Penalty</h3>
<p>Qinghua Alumni Association Submits Letter of Grievance</p>
<p>Chen Sancai, the former General Manager of the Beiji Company, served as the President of the Shanghai Lianqing Society and the President of the Shanghai Qinghua Alumni Association during his lifetime. When Shanghai fell, Chen, driven by patriotic zeal, planned to assassinate the traitor Wang Jingwei. At that time, he conspired with the two White Russians Tao Juesha Gier and Tao Jue Bolisis brothers to carry out the plan, but he was betrayed by the two White Russians and immediately sacrificed himself.

The directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Tsinghua University Alumni Association and all members of the Shanghai Lianqing Society have submitted letters requesting the court to sentence the two White Russian criminals to the ultimate penalty to avenge the martyr Chen.</p>
<h3>Opium Smokers Who Served as Traitors to be Tried by the High Court</h3>
<p>Judicial Yuan Order Explanation</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of whether traitors who did not serve in the puppet army during the period of occupation, but who held military positions after the victory, should be treated as military traitors if discovered, the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation Order No. 3333 has provided an explanation, which states that it has been resolved by the Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference that the defendant in a traitor case was originally not a soldier and did not serve in the puppet army. Only after the victory did he serve in the army and obtain military status. If he is discovered to be a traitor when he is not in office or service, he should be tried by the High Court or its branch in accordance with Article 16 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>Article 16 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Procedure Law originally states: If a soldier commits a crime before taking office or service, and it is discovered while he is in office or service, he shall be tried by a joint military and judicial trial according to his rank. If the crime is committed while he is in office or service, and it is discovered after he has been dismissed or discharged, he shall be tried by the court, but this shall not apply to cases where the person has been deprived of his official position.</p>
<h3>Telegrams Between Shanghai and Taiwan Still Being Sent and Received as Usual</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It has been widely rumored that telegrams between Shanghai and Taiwan have been interrupted due to the expansion of the riots in Taiwan. Yesterday, the reporter visited Yu Bingjian, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, who said that this rumor is completely untrue. The Shanghai-Taiwan wireless circuit is still open. Currently, all telegrams to Taiwan from all over the country are transferred by the bureau, causing extreme congestion in the telegraph service. The transmissions are being sent in order, and there may be some delays. Furthermore, because the Taiwan Bureau is having difficulty delivering telegrams, it temporarily limited the acceptance of telegrams yesterday to avoid delays. However, telegrams for which the sender is willing to be responsible are still being accepted as usual, and there are no restrictions.</p>
<p>[Another report] Wireless telegrams between Shanghai and Taiwan Province were exchanged throughout the day yesterday, except for a brief interruption from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. However, there were very few incoming telegrams. Outgoing telegrams, except for urgent telegrams which were temporarily suspended, ordinary telegrams were accepted and sent as usual, but not as quickly as usual. The main reason is that many of the middle and lower-level staff of the Taiwan Provincial Telecommunications Department, such as telegraphers, were originally Taiwanese. After this incident occurred, they were somewhat affected, and their work was inevitably slackened.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships Safely Arrive in Keelung</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Shipping lines between Shanghai and Taiwan have been completely suspended due to the Taipei riots. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ma Chang, Hai Zhou, and Hai Chen freedom ships, and the Zhong Zi No. 102 and Zhong Zi No. 103 landing craft, which sailed to Keelung the other day, all arrived yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The Chunghsing Shipping Company's Chunghsing passenger ship arrived in Keelung on the morning of the 5th of this month and left Keelung at 2:30 PM on the 6th to sail to Shantou. It left Shantou again the day before yesterday at 3:30 PM to come to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port tomorrow morning, carrying 600 to 700 passengers from Taiwan and Shantou.</p>
<p>In addition, the French postal ship Félix Roussel, which departed from Marseille on the 15th of last month to come to China, will arrive in Xigong in a few days and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>A New Communication Method is Fast and Accurate</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A new wireless communication method will be launched between Shanghai and San Francisco in the near future, called wireless teleprinter facsimile telegraphy.</p>
<p>Wireless teleprinter facsimile telegraphy was widely used by the US Army and Navy during the war. When two locations are equipped with this equipment, one party types on a typewriter, and the keys on the other party's typewriter rise and fall simultaneously due to the oscillation of radio waves. Therefore, in an instant, the telegram sent from the typewriter on this side appears on the receiving paper of the typewriter on the other side. Its advantage is not only speed, but also because it is a mechanical action, it does not need to go through the stage of code translation, so the accuracy rate is indeed 100%.</p>
<p>After the war, surplus materials from the US military, including this equipment, were sold to the Chinese government. The Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Bureau cooperated with the American Wireless Traffic Company, hiring three experts from the company to come to Shanghai to guide the installation and training of technicians, which has been completed. A trial report was recently conducted, and the results were excellent. It is now awaiting approval from the Ministry of Communications and can be officially started in the near future.</p>
<h3>Wireless Teleprinter Facsimile Telegraphy to be Launched Between Shanghai and San Francisco Immediately, Head of the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Section Accused of Embezzling Bonuses, Trial Begins, Large Discrepancy Between Both Parties in Valuing Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of Feng Lianke, Head of the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Section, being accused of embezzling whistleblower bonuses, was tried in the District Court yesterday. According to the plaintiff, Song Ziling, on September 2nd of last year, due to his tip-off, Jianghai Customs seized 64 pieces of smuggled goods on the Hanyang ship, which he estimated to be worth 6 billion yuan. The next day, Feng only acknowledged two pieces of smuggled goods as having been tipped off by him, in an attempt to embezzle the whistleblower bonus, and said that according to the Customs' regulations on rewarding whistleblowers, he should receive 40% of the value of the smuggled goods, which is approximately 2.64 billion yuan in legal tender. However, according to the defendant's statement, Song's accusation is false and he has never engaged in corruption or bribery. The value of the smuggled goods, according to Customs' estimation, is only worth 88.8 million yuan. After questioning both parties in court, the case needs further investigation and the discussion was rescheduled for further deliberation.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute: Huanhua Dismisses Four Workers, Huacheng Raises the Issue</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Huanhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 85, Lane 98, Yude Road, Tushan Bay, previously had a dispute because the employer did not comply with the wage payment method for power outages as decided by the Labor-Management Arbitration Conference. After mediation by the Social Bureau, it was decided to pay two days' wages for four days of power outages. However, the employer did not comply and dismissed four worker representatives, including Fan Fahui.

Yesterday, the workers sent representatives to the Social Bureau for instructions and reported on the progress. It is understood that if the dispute cannot be resolved reasonably, the dyeing and weaving industry unions in the 2nd and 3rd districts will support them.</p>

<h3>Li Shiyu, Who Served in Puppet Positions and Participated in the Cleansing Campaign, Receives Initial Trial, Claims to Have Done Subversion Work</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Li Shiyu's case of suspected collaboration with the enemy was initially questioned in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Li is from Heilongjiang, forty-odd years old, and originally worked as a staff member of the Military Commission's International Affairs Research Office in Tianjin. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic of China, he defected and served as a standing committee member of the puppet Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and concurrently as the chief secretary of the puppet Hebei Higher Court. In the 29th year, through the introduction of Fu Shuangying, the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Political Training Department, he met Chen Gongbo, the President of the Puppet Legislative Yuan, and was assigned to be a legislator by Chen. In August of the 30th year, he was transferred to the Director of the Military Law Department of the Puppet Shanghai Security Command. In February of the 30th year, the puppet government began the cleansing campaign, and Chen Gongbo was appointed as the Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Cleansing Committee, and Li Shiyu was appointed as the Director of the Fourth Department of the Committee and concurrently as the Captain of the Enforcement Team. The enforcement team was stationed in all suburban areas of Shanghai, such as Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Beiqiao, Pudong, and Chongming. In the spring of the 32nd year, the enemy and puppet forces took over the concessions, and Li Shiyu was reassigned as the Director of the Judicial Department of the Puppet Shanghai First and Third Police Bureaus. Later, the First and Third Bureaus were merged into the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, and Li remained the Director of the Judicial Department. In July of the 34th year, our war situation improved and the enemy was on the verge of collapse. Li Shiyu took the opportunity to secretly present a subversion plan to the Central Government, hoping to cover up his past crimes. After the victory, he worked in the Military Statistics Bureau. Due to his serious past crimes, he was arrested by the Military Statistics Bureau and sent to the High Court for trial. According to Li Shiyu's defense yesterday, he participated in the Puppet Sixth National Congress and later participated in the puppet organization under the secret orders of the Central Government. From the winter of the 30th year, he participated in He Shizhen's underground work in Shanghai. He also did his best in other aspects, such as engaging in subversion work before the victory and arresting traitors after the victory. After the court hearing, it was decided to reschedule the hearing for further investigation of evidence, and the defendant was returned to the detention center.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Staff Savings - Many Problems Remain Regarding Repayment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of repayment of savings, retirement, and pension funds for Chinese staff of the former Public Works Bureau, the subcommittee of the Liquidation Committee has repeatedly held meetings for discussion. The date for calculation has been decided to be up to the time of the Japanese occupation of the concessions during the Pacific War, i.e., the end of December 1941. Matters after that date will be discussed in detail later. As for the calculation of multiples, it is proposed to repay based on the multiples of the current municipal government bureaus' civil servant grades. However, it has been decided that the repayment date should not be too far apart from the most recent date of adjustment in civil servant salaries. As for British and American personnel, the government is requested to repay at the foreign exchange rate. As for personnel from neutral countries, it was previously heard that the calculation period was shorter than that for British and Americans, and they are requesting the same treatment. When the subcommittee met on the 9th, they attended to state their reasons. The subcommittee will submit these opinions to the Liquidation Committee. It is understood that if the repayment is carried out according to the above method, the total amount will be 70 billion, which the municipal government is unable to pay. It should be requested to be allocated by the central government. As for Mayor Wu's telegram requesting assistance from officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, no one has come to Shanghai to date.</p>

Therefore, they jointly request the Chamber of Commerce to convene a temporary members' meeting to concentrate the opinions of various industries for joint discussion.</p>

Until this spring, Li worked at the Hexing Shoe Shop on Qipu Road, and his whereabouts gradually became sparse. Someone told Chen's parents that Fengxian was beautiful and should not marry this shoemaker. The mother was moved and persuaded Fengxian not to associate with Li. Li's business was suspended on the 27th of last month, and he was unemployed at home. At 4:30 a.m. three days ago, Li waited in Lane 210, Taikang Road, hoping to meet the girl. Before long, the girl went to the factory to work and was intercepted. He insisted on inviting her to Hangzhou. The girl refused, and Li immediately took out a book to threaten her. The girl was extremely frightened and shouted for help. Li then took out a leather knife from his sleeve and stabbed her throat three times in a row, causing unstoppable bleeding. The murderer saw the great disaster he had caused and fled. Afterward, the girl returned to her residence with the wound, accompanied by her mother to the hospital for treatment. The hospital reported to the Lujiawan Police Station, which dispatched police to arrest the suspect, but he was not found. Later, Director Li of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Hearing Bureau learned about it and immediately sent officers to investigate thoroughly. He summoned the deceased's father, Chen Jiliang, to the bureau and learned that the murderer had gone to Hangzhou to live with his brother's family. He then sent the handling police officer to Hangzhou to investigate. He first visited various shoe stores inside and outside the city. He was finally arrested at the Kaide Shoe Shop at 10:00 p.m. on the 9th. He was escorted to Shanghai the next morning. He will be transferred to the judicial authorities for trial after interrogation.</p>

The ticket collectors of the theater stopped them. The group refused and shouted and started to fight. The followers took out iron rods and other objects from their sleeves and started to commit violence. They smashed the windows, lights, teapots, and stools in the theater. The audience was frightened and scattered. Wu Qiliang, the stage inspector, stepped forward to stop them and was hit on the head and bled. The Songshan Branch received the alarm and immediately dispatched all officers to the scene. Only two of the followers, Li and Zhang, were apprehended and sent to the procuratorate for interrogation yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the leader, Du Xiaomao, dared to lead more than ten accomplices, each carrying weapons, to surround the residence of Kunqu performer Xiao Wenyan at 292 Xie Xu Road to make trouble.

<h3>Ministry of Education Stipulates Mandarin as the Language of Instruction - Implements Enhanced Speaking Instruction - Orders All Bookstores and Schools to Comply</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, March 11] In order to eliminate illiteracy and popularize Mandarin teaching, the Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued orders for compliance over the years. Recently, publishing houses, agencies, and schools have often failed to comply when printing reading materials for primary school students and the public. The curriculum standards stipulate that all subjects should be taught in Mandarin and should be divided into four items: "reading," "speaking," "writing," and "calligraphy." At present, general primary schools omit speaking or even do not teach phonetic symbols, and the language and pronunciation use dialects and dialect sounds, which are very inappropriate. An order has been issued to promulgate the "Measures for Promoting the Implementation of Phonetic Mandarin" and the "Measures for Promoting Phonetic Symbols in Various Provinces, Cities, and Counties," ordering the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to comply and instruct all publishing houses, national schools, primary schools, and public schools under their jurisdiction to comply, and to effectively strengthen "speaking" teaching, and to use Mandarin as the language of instruction for all subjects, and to use standard pronunciation for reading.</p>
<h3>Cheng Qibao Moves to Wangchenggang - Is Mediating the Zhengda University Student Strike</h3>
<p>The School Protection Association said: Zhengda was born with deficiencies and acquired maladjustments. Principal Xiao is a nursing mother without milk. They also compared Cheng to a doctor, and the students are welcoming the doctor to give Zhengda an injection to replenish it.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanchang, March 11] The student strike at Zhongzheng University is being mediated by Cheng Qibao, a specialist from the Ministry of Education. He promised to convey the students' legitimate demands in this student strike to the central government, but he hoped to restore order immediately. The students still insisted on their original position and would not resume classes until Principal Xiao resigned and was approved. Cheng, accompanied by Li Tao, Secretary of Zhengda, went to Qin City at 8:30 a.m. yesterday to listen to reports from both teachers and students about Zhengda. After Cheng's car arrived at the school, he first met with Principal Xiao and inspected the internal situation of the school. Students lined up on the side of the road in the student dormitory in the third district to welcome him and chanted slogans such as "We want the dean," "We want books," and "We want instruments." Cheng inspected the student dormitory toilets as the students sang the school protection song. He then convened a meeting with teachers and staff at Zheng She, which was presided over by Wang Yi, Director of the Department of Literature and History. The professors provided opinions on the inside story and process of the student strike. At 1:00 p.m., Cheng convened a meeting with 42 student representatives from various departments and grades to listen to their reports. The students firmly stated that they would not resume classes until Principal Xiao's resignation was approved and became a fact. All the students borrowed the library to welcome Cheng's instructions. A representative of the School Protection Association gave a speech, saying: Zhengda was born with deficiencies and acquired maladjustments. Principal Xiao is a nursing mother without milk. They also compared Cheng to a doctor, and the students are welcoming the doctor to give Zhengda an injection to replenish it. Cheng told the teachers and students that Zhengda was established during the war and has been relocated several times. Today, it still stands on the hill, which is extremely arduous. He specially conveyed Minister Zhu's condolences. The Ministry of Education is trying to improve the poor treatment and insecure life of teachers and staff. However, the influx of gold has had some impact. Chairman Jiang has attached more importance to this issue after becoming the head of the Executive Yuan. Cheng finally said: National Zhongzheng University is the youngest national university in the country, and all equipment cannot be quickly achieved by one or two people in a short time. It is hoped that everyone will work together and help each other to achieve the ideal. It is heard that the Zhengda University student strike is at a standstill. Cheng moved to Wangchenggang on campus today and is studying methods to mediate it.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanchang, March 11] Chairman Jiang is extremely concerned about the Zhengda University student strike.

If the situation becomes unmanageable, he will not tolerate it and will deal with it decisively.</p>

<h3>Restoring Championship Form, Hualian Defeats Renyu, Encas Wins Hailu Qing by One Point, Chenyou Easily Defeats Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the second basketball league, Hualian played Renyu last night, and the gymnasium was once again overcrowded. Hualian's Da Li did not "go to sea," reportedly due to a foot injury. Bao Songyuan became the representative to command the team, resulting in a 51-36 victory over Renyu, with the halftime score at 24-14. In the other two games, Chenyou II defeated Shanghai Railway 72-46, and Encas I reversed the defeat in the last three minutes, winning 45-44, by only one point in the final moment. Last night, Hualian's Lao Bao was an ideal figure, and Xue Chongxiang and Ren Guorong both developed evenly. Wu Chengzhang and Liang Xiong were also qualified. Renyu's players are young and promising, but lack on-field experience, revealing a "pipa playing" posture as soon as they took the court.</p>
<p>Chenyou Defeats Railway</p>
<p>After Chenyou's Wang Rongsheng and Wang Bingfu scored six consecutive points, Shanghai Railway's Zhang Qu (Banglun) finally made a shot. Rong Sheng and Shi Jiuquan continued to increase the score, and soon the score was 16-5. At this point, the Railway team was in a state of disarray. The score was recorded as 26-9 at ten minutes. Railway's Wang Kunxi replaced Zhang Qichang, and immediately scored a goal upon entering the court, but the opponent's momentum was difficult to stop. The score was 38-13 at fifteen minutes, and Chenyou paused at 40-13. Railway's Zhang Qichang re-entered the battle, and Wang Binghao exited. The halftime score was 50-17.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Railway team scored eight points instantly, and Chenyou found it difficult to score. The players who entered the second half were Ling Peng, Huang Cunrui, Zhang Qichen, Shi Jiuquan, and Bao Daowei. To arouse interest, this was not the official lineup. In the last four minutes, the score was 67-38, and Chenyou made a full adjustment, eventually winning 75-46.</p>
<p>Chenyou Scores</p>

<p>Hailu Qing Suffers Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>The battle between Encas and Hailu Qing was like the American Civil War, with strong bodies, rough movements, and quite a bit of forceful performance. Initially, Encas took the lead, but after ten minutes, Hailu Qing surpassed them with 19-17. Then, the score became tied at 19 each. The physical combat became more intense, and Hailu Qing ended the first half with 25 points to 21. In the second half, the "martial arts style" melee continued for five minutes, and the two sides began to score. Although the match was intense, it was a fierce battle at close quarters. Encas chased quickly, and suddenly V. Kailu Siji tied the score at 39. Bao Lai surpassed by two points at 41. At that time, four minutes were reported. Ge Peng was penalized, and Hailu Qing's Fulu Que made the free throw. Peter Jones scored, making the score 42, surpassing Encas by one point. Kailu Siji scored, and Encas was back up by one point. Boluha injured his ankle, and Bosbei replaced him. Encas bought a timeout, and Hailu Qing's Fulu Que each scored a goal, making the score 45-44, with Encas leading by one point. Hailu Qing called a timeout at the last moment, but at that time there were only three seconds left. After the start, the buzzer sounded first, and the ball went in later, so the goal should be ruled invalid. Hailu Qing was very regretful, and the audience also expressed deep sympathy. The final score was 45-44.</p>
<p>Hualian Defeats Renyu</p>
<p>Renyu's Shen Pengju and Hualian's Chen Xuechong successively made free throws to establish the first merit. Zhang Liangxiong's long-range shot from the baseline made the score 3-1, boosting Hualian's morale. Xuechong scored again, and Songyuan and Xuechong increased the score to nine points. Renyu called a timeout. Lao Bao missed a free throw, but was countered by Wu Xinyun of the opponent with a one-on-one fast break. Ren Xiangcheng also surrounded and shot, making the score 14-4 when Renyu called another timeout. Renyu's Chen Wei Yuan entered to replace Wu Xin, and the situation improved. Shen Pengju scored nine points, and Hualian's Lao Bao was cheered by the audience. Xiangcheng often stole "cold rice." At the time of the last half, the score was 24-14. Adi (Wu Chengzhang) seemed abnormal.</p>
<p>After the break, Zhuo Guoquan replaced Zhang Liangxiong, and Renyu replaced Chen Weiyuan with Wu Xinyun. Yao Wenyi used two free throws to add two points for Renyu. Wu Chengzhang "answered the call after a long wait," and at this time made his virgin work, making a free throw. Zhuo Guorong's left-handed shot was very confident. Lao Bao replaced Da Li to command the team and became the cornerstone of the entire team last night. In the last four minutes, the score was 49-30. As a result, Hualian defeated Renyu 51-36.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Football Replay Railway Team to Battle Qingbai Again This Afternoon at 3:30 PM at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>The Mayor's Cup football match will be replayed for the second time between the Railway and Qingbai teams at 3:30 PM this afternoon at Yiyuan.

<p>The outcome of today's battle is difficult to predict, because when they first met in the initial finals last week, they drew with two goals each. Meeting again today, both sides will definitely go all out. Qingbai's lineup today, except for Gao Baozheng and Fei Chunhua, who will not be able to play due to some reason, all other veterans such as Yan Shijin, Meng Yiliang, and Li Yichen will be on the field, so the strength is still very strong. The Railway lineup is the same as the first battle, and the lineup is quite flexible and tough. When they meet then, there will definitely be many highlights. Qingbai notified all players to gather at the Paramount this afternoon, wearing tooth-white and red striped jerseys and white shorts.</p>

<h3>Reestablishment of the City Athletic Federation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Sports Federation was formed in 1928 by schools such as Provincial Shanghai Middle School, Fudan, Fushi, Pudong, Minli, Guanghua, Daxia, Soochow, Jinan, Chizhi, Qixiu, Rongde, Aiguo, and Minli Girls' Middle School. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the schools moved inland and the federation's affairs were suspended. Now, the old members, except for Jinan, Chizhi, and Nanyang Vocational and Commercial School, which have not yet reopened, have all returned to their original locations. The federation's affairs cannot be delayed. Therefore, Chen De, Wu Lisheng, Zhang Yunzhong, and others held a reestablishment meeting at Fudan Middle School the other day. It was resolved that in addition to registering old members, new members would also be invited to join by letter.</p>

<h3>Borotra, Old But Strong</h3>
<p>Wins Championship at Nearly Fifty Years Old</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] At the Lyon International Indoor Tennis Tournament, French veteran tennis player Borotra unexpectedly won the championship in the final on Saturday. Borotra is almost fifty years old now, and he was once a champion more than ten years ago. It is unexpected that he is still so strong at his age. In addition, Kokin is also a veteran in the French tennis world, currently forty-four years old. He has won the tennis championship in Egypt. It is expected that these two veterans will compete soon, and all young tennis players will be watching closely.</p>

<h3>Scraps from the Sidelines</h3>
<p>A huge upset broke out in yesterday evening's basketball league: Hai Muqing lost to Encas by one point, ruining their hope of winning the championship.</p>
<p>Encas's victory was a strategic success, not a fluke. Ge Peng Qiguifu was responsible for closely guarding Hailuqing's tall center Fuluque, which was very effective in cutting off the connection between Hailuqing's offense and defense. Then, Ma Hanxing and Ao Chailiao, two short and fierce players, were used to break through and seize the ball, transport it near the basket, and pass it to Bao Lai and E. Kailuosigai on both sides to score.</p>
<p>The actions of both teams were chaotic and procrastinating, and there were very few clear and beautiful baskets in the entire game. Both sides relied on mid-range shooting to score points. In the first half, Encas once led by 14 to 6, and in the second half, Hailuqing once took the advantage with 35 to 27. Encas had plenty of stamina and was eventually able to reverse the defeat.</p>
<p>Encas's defeat of Hailuqing indirectly created an opportunity for Hualian.</p>
<p>In another game, Hualian easily defeated Renyu. Da Li did not play due to injury. Renyu was eager to win, but put on an abnormal performance. It was the team's worst performance of the season. They had no offensive methods, the defense was also lax, and the shooting was even more careless, forming a mess.</p>
<p>Lao Bao replaced Da Li as the main player. His blocks, saves, interceptions, and shots were excellent, but he showed off too much in the second half. Although Wu Chengzhang was on the court, he didn't put in much effort. Ren Xiangcheng made many mistakes in passing last night. Since long passes are not reliable, they should not be overused. Zhuo Guorong entered the game in the second half and had a tacit understanding with Xue Chong in passing.</p>
<p>The score was always five points apart. When the score was 45 to 28 in the second half, the advantage was already clear, and the audience left one after another. (Chang Nian)</p>

<h3>Garrison Command Accepts Stock Exchange Request</h3>
<p>Banning Black Market Transactions Outside the Exchange, Cutting Off Privately Installed Telephones for Collusion, Confiscating Telephone Sets, and Arresting Principals for Legal Prosecution.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Stock Exchange recently sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Command requesting the suppression of black market transactions outside the stock exchange, stating in brief: Since the promulgation of the emergency economic measures plan, floating capital will inevitably concentrate in the stock market in large quantities. If it is a legitimate transaction, the more floating capital enters the stock market, the more the pressure on prices will be reduced, so it should be actively encouraged. However, black market transactions have always existed in the stock market. The method is mainly collusion, and the nature is actually gambling. Unscrupulous firms use private telephones to engage in buying and selling between customers and firms, and between firms and firms. The amount of transactions is several times higher than legal transactions, often hundreds of thousands of shares each time. This type of collusion transaction never involves the delivery of physical goods or funds. The buyer pays interest on a daily basis, and the seller receives interest on a daily basis, which is contrary to the provisions of the Exchange Law. Moreover, the difference between the interest rate and the transaction price is huge, all decided by the black market operators according to their own interests, enriching themselves and manipulating the market. After the transaction is completed, the profit and loss are calculated according to the final price of the day, and the payment is cleared on the settlement date until the transaction is completed. This type of black market collusion and legitimate transactions are completely different matters for floating capital flowing into the stock market. If it is not eliminated, the harm will be extremely serious. The major drawbacks are: (1) When the market price fluctuates sharply, black market operators often cannot balance long and short positions, and cases of default and bankruptcy are endless. Many customers and firms suffer, which has an impact on social security and financial stability. (2) Black market operators use the rise and fall of interest rates to pressure long and short positions, thereby creating waves and hindering the interests of legitimate investors. (3) The government specially approves the establishment of a stock market, with the aim of guiding social floating capital to develop industrial and commercial enterprises. Because of the existence of black market collusion, it hinders the healthy development of the legitimate stock market. (4) The law stipulates that stock transactions must be subject to transaction tax collected by the exchange on behalf of the government. However, black market transactions outside the exchange are not taxed. Investors avoid taxes and do not go to the exchange but enter the black market, which affects national tax revenue. (5) Collusion is an illegal transaction, and privately installed telephones are sufficient to spread rumors and create disturbances, which hinders public order. The operators disregard the law and take it easy, which over time develops the habit of committing crimes in society, and the hidden worries are worth considering. Therefore, it is recommended to take decisive measures, cut off the privately installed telephone lines for collusion, confiscate the telephone sets, and arrest the principals for legal prosecution. It is now known that the Garrison Command has accepted the Stock Exchange's proposal and has notified the police department to start cracking down immediately.</p>
<h3>Yongsha Struggles and Wriggles, Cold Stocks Rise to Limit One After Another</h3>
<p>The short selling forces in the Chinese stock market suddenly strengthened yesterday. After a lot of struggle, the market finally fell sharply from a high point at noon. The situation eased in the afternoon and gradually softened. The banking sector provided some support, but the market ended at a low price at the close. However, if the long and short positions are adjusted and smoothed out, and based on the news that bank credit will be relaxed in the near future, the day when the next installment is delivered may once again unleash its aggressive buying momentum.</p>
<p>The market opened high in the morning. After the opening, Yongsha was sold from 180 to 177, 218, and 84, with small sellers pushing the price down to 3,340 yuan. Buyers came in from 185, 32, 133, and 14. Datong, China-France, Yonggong, New Asia, American Asia, Yongye, China Shipping, and Guohuo all rose to the limit one after another.

Sellers from 198 and 180 sold at high points and were seen on the market. 76, 141, 87, and 207 all sold, and the price fell back to 3,180 yuan. 152, 198, and 94 were still buying. Many stocks that had been stagnant and miscellaneous brands rose to the limit. The situation was mostly flat. Later, 207 repeatedly sold aggressively, gradually forming a sign of decline. Most scattered investors were uncertain. The market became more fearful at the close. 112 and 133 and others all closed their positions. The market closed at a low price of 3,150 yuan. After the close, offers of 3,140 yuan and 3,150 yuan were heard. As a result, Yongsha, Xinhuo, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by about half of their value.

<h3>Foreign Stocks Firm Before Retreating Slightly</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks did not break out of the flat market yesterday. After being firm, they retreated slightly. Among the small stocks, there was no lack of attractive ones. Yipi rose more, while Yisha started at 21,000 yuan and was closed out by Guang gangs and securities gangs at a low price. As a result, rubber stocks were stable, Yipi rose by less than 10%, and the rest rose and fell only slightly.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Government bonds rose and then consolidated yesterday, but interest among people in the industry continued to be high, and the process continued to be firm. Unified Bing opened at 11,000 yuan and rose to 12,800 yuan. Longs came out, and the price fell to 10,800 yuan. After that, the price hovered steadily.

<h3>Consultation Meeting to be Held Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Tea merchant representatives Shou Jingwei, Li Shan, Sun Xiaobang, Tao Zhensheng, and others visited Liu Gongyun, Vice President and Business Bureau Chief of the Central Bank, yesterday to discuss the purchase of export tea for 1946 and delivered the new plan proposed by the tea industry. Liu said that because he had only recently taken office, he did not have detailed knowledge of the handling and negotiation process of this matter. Therefore, he decided to convene a consultation meeting this afternoon at 3:00 PM with representatives from the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, tea merchants, and the original handlers of this case from the Central Bank to discuss the purchase method.</p>

<h3>Production Loan Inspection Team Increases Personnel and Hastens Completion of Work</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The work of inspecting the raw wax fee weaving industry has now been two-thirds completed. There are still 100 factories waiting to be inspected, and it is expected that all work will be completed before the middle of next month. In order to speed up the process, a new batch of personnel has recently been added, totaling 26 people, all of whom have been transferred from relevant departments. The inspection team itself is a temporary organization. Once the work is completed, it will be disbanded. The investigation report will be submitted to the Four Banks Joint Treasury, which will be used as the basis for handling this matter. Whether it will be released to the public is still unknown. As of now, the inspection work has not revealed other malpractices, except that some factories used the loans to purchase gold. As for the factories that purchased gold, they also used debt repayment as a reason. In the future, the Four Banks will consider the severity of the situation and recover the loans early from these factories. Most factories used production loans to repay high-interest loans. Although this does not comply with the loan regulations, it is still reasonable and will not be investigated in depth. Furthermore, the future report will analyze in detail the relationship between the loan and the factory's production and sales, whether the application of the loan is appropriate, and whether the distribution of the loan is accurate, as a reference for future government loans to private industries.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Requests Price Increase, Passengers and Cargo Rush to Load</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, there have been widespread rumors of fare increases, and various passengers have been purchasing goods and rushing to load them in order to pay less freight, especially for goods being transported to Tianjin. Yesterday, the ship from Hai Zhe sailed to Tianjin, carrying more than 7,200 bags of sugar, more than 300 pieces of cotton yarn, more than 1,700 pieces of textiles, and 2,000 boxes of cigarettes, fully loaded for Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Transactions Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of about 11,000 shi of rice and grain arrived in the northern and southern markets. The stores sold them all, but the market transactions were still stagnant, with no buyers. The situation of japonica rice is deteriorating daily, continuing to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, with middle rice falling by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Indica rice also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. White yuan goods are in short supply and stable, while yin yuan also has no fluctuations.</p>
<p>Flour is gradually declining and moving slowly, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Bran is rarely inquired about. Soybean cakes are still sluggish in customer sales, returning to a weary state with a slightly reduced market shape.</p>
<p>Soybeans are digesting poorly, with northeastern soybeans being clearly priced but secretly stagnant.

<h3>UNRRA Cotton Allocation Method: Handled According to Foreign Cotton Procurement Rules</h3>
<p>After consultations between the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) regarding the allocation of raw cotton supplied, the quota allocation, and the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee and the Executive Yuan, it was decided that the allocation would be handled by the Executive Yuan according to the principles stipulated in the "Foreign Cotton Procurement Rules." However, the quantity allocated to a certain yarn factory cannot exceed the difference between the four-month inventory and the three-month order requirement, minus the allocation limit. It is also heard that for factories that have not purchased cotton yarn through the Board of Trustees, if they need to purchase foreign cotton, the six district cotton spinning associations should first inspect the quality of the 20-count yarn spun by each factory. Only those that are rated as Grade D or above after inspection will be allowed to purchase foreign cotton. The current allocation of raw cotton is temporarily limited to 39 units (including Shanghai Municipal Factory No. 36, foreign companies Lundchang and Ewo, and the state-run Textile Construction Company) that have already received cotton yarn from the six cotton spinning associations. The following is the limit on the number of cotton bales that should be obtained based on the above principles.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Cables the Central Bank Auditing Office to Strengthen Supervision of Bank Operations</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the supervision of banks and improve business efficiency, the Ministry of Finance has formulated ten items for inspectors to supervise and correct when inspecting banks, and has specially cabled the Central Bank Auditing Office to implement them earnestly: (1) Technical errors in the application of accounting subjects, accounting procedures, and accounting procedures that do not involve malpractices; (2) The names and arrangements of accounting subjects and the format of accounting books do not comply with regulations; (3) Account names do not comply with the provisions of the "Name Usage Regulations"; (4) Temporary receipts and payments have been suspended for too long, and should be investigated and transferred without doubt; (5) Various loans have not been established or exceed the prescribed limits; (6) Overdue loans or collection items should be collected and settled; (7) Various depreciation and amortization have not been handled in accordance with regulations; (8) Withheld taxes have been delayed in being paid to the treasury; (9) Collateralized loans have not obtained the right of pledge; (10) Other technical oversights in business processing should be noted and improved.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Monthly Raw Material Needs of Rubber Factories in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to a survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: The monthly raw rubber material needs of the rubber industry in this city are 1,739.5 tons. The total monthly needs of other regions outside Shanghai are 1,605 tons. The details are as follows: 72 member companies in Shanghai need 1,739.5 tons per month. 4 member companies in Tianjin need 270 tons per month.

The northeastern provinces are estimated to need 120 tons per month. Guangzhou is estimated to need 300 tons per month. Therefore, the surveyed raw rubber demand in various regions of the country is 3,344.5 tons per month.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Material Prices Vary</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The industrial raw material market has been active in recent days. Caustic soda, with more goods being released, saw its market price rise and then fall again. Yesterday, the market price for Moon Brand caustic soda was 4.5 million yuan, pure soda Moon Brand was 280,000 yuan, Magari was 220,000 yuan, and Yongli was 180,000 to 200,000 yuan. Glycerin and stearic acid had no transactions. Ammonium sulfate and fat field powder were in demand by customers, and the market price rose sharply, reaching 4.5 million yuan per ton, which was very popular. Yellow and white petroleum jelly prices fell again. Original new barrels of yellow petroleum jelly were priced at 1,000 yuan per pound. It is heard that customers have been purchasing a lot recently, and the price is still rising sharply because the current market price is much lower than the order price. The estimated cost per pound for the order is 1,500 yuan. Zinc powder still stands at a high price of 10 million per ton.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Trade Difficult to Develop</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for English tea remained sluggish. Although buyers were still inquiring about the aged Qimen tea from the 34th year, the asking price was still tight, only about 500,000 yuan per dan. However, according to the sellers, the cost was high, and they were reluctant to sell for less than 570,000 yuan. As a result, there was no certainty in the negotiation, and transactions were difficult to expand. As for the variety of green tea, except for old goods that had been in stock for many years, which were difficult to sell, the rest were not stagnant, and the green tea from the 34th and 35th years was selling more smoothly. The market price was consistent with supply and demand, and there were no fluctuations. Domestic sales of red and green tea have been sluggish for a long time, and there is still little excitement to be seen. The market situation is still calm due to the inability of specialty goods to raise prices.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Product Association Handles Yarn Inventory Registration</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Eight units of the city's cotton yarn reproduction industry association held a joint meeting at the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm. Representatives from various industries, including Li Daofa, Ni Gengnian, Xu Zhaohou, and Yao Siwei, attended the meeting. The industry was ordered by the Shanghai Garrison Command's Cloth and Yarn Group to register the inventory of yarn among its members. Therefore, it was decided to handle the registration themselves and then report it. It was also decided to send representatives to the garrison department in the near future to inquire about the registration procedures.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Sales Sparse</h3>
<p>The yarn market was increasingly sluggish yesterday, with customer sales even sparser, and transactions on this street were particularly rare. The market was filled with sellers, but even at the limited price, it was not easy to find buyers. Therefore, yarns below 20 counts fell by 5%, and the black market disappeared invisibly. However, fine yarn and 42-count ply yarn, because there were not many in stock, fell only slightly. Even at the official price, it was still difficult to buy.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Prices Gradually Decrease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was not very active. The Textile Construction Company supplied and sold various types of cloth as usual. The 20-count cloth was lower than the previous period. Therefore, 12-count cloth was only 153,500 yuan, chicken cloth was 146,000 yuan, and sun cloth was 143,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 405 fine twill per bolt also fell sharply by 5,000 yuan to 213,500 yuan. Colored goods only rose by 5,000 yuan compared to the original tribute cloth. However, it is heard that the Tianjin group is slightly interested in summer cloth, so the white gray cloth market is still firm.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Allied Company Does Not Accept Overseas Orders</h3>
<p>The Silk Weaving Allied Company recently has more than 600 bolts of woven fabrics for export. However, many orders placed by Indian merchants in the past have been canceled or delayed due to the government's regulation of foreign exchange. Therefore, in the future, the company will negotiate with local foreign merchants to sell spot goods as a principle, and will not accept orders for the time being to avoid future disputes due to currency system issues.</p>
<h3>Hankou Tung Oil Arrives, Market Price Stable, Transactions Rare</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that a large number of tung oil from Hankou has been shipped to Shanghai in batches. The market price is stable. It is difficult for tung oil other than adequately-produced tung oil to improve in price, and transactions are also rare. Yesterday, the market price for adequate tung oil was 450,000 yuan including the barrel, and 430,000 yuan without the barrel. Domestic tung oil was 400,000 yuan, Fujian Xi Hong was 370,000 yuan per barrel, and Hongjiang was 250,000 yuan per barrel.</p>
<h3>Ramie Market Price Declines</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Half a month ago, ramie reached a high point. White ramie was priced at 500,000 yuan per shi dan, and the market was very firm. In recent days, sales have become sluggish, and the price in Hankou has frequently declined. Yesterday, white ramie was priced at 400,000 yuan per shi zu, green ramie was 330,000 yuan, yellow ramie was 200,000 yuan, yarn ramie was 200,000 yuan, thick ramie was 200,000 yuan, and Ting ramie was 381,000 yuan, all of which were much lower than before.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Death of the Father of the Nation, Seeking Freedom and Equality for China</h3>
<p>— From the Newspaper's Archives</p>
<p>Twenty-two years ago today, the Father of the Nation passed away in Beijing's Iron Lion Hutong due to liver disease. At that time, the situation in China was that the National Revolutionary Army in the south had just left Guangdong and was facing obstruction from warlords along the way. The north and central China were completely in the hands of feudal remnants of warlords and politicians. The dark official politics since the Yuan Shikai era loomed over most of China. Therefore, the Father of the Nation ignored the advice of many comrades and traveled from Guangzhou to the north despite his illness, hoping to persuade these politicians and warlords who were focused on their own interests to seek peace and unity for China. In the thirteen years since the founding of the Republic, the situation had been so heartbreaking for the Father of the Nation. Years of warlord wars had left the country full of devastation, with the people suffering and impoverished. The new nation not only had no hope of construction, but also had no chance to catch its breath. It relied solely on foreign debt to quench its thirst. Under such circumstances, it was naturally impossible for the country to rise from its semi-colonial status. The Father of the Nation felt that for the revolution to truly succeed, first, there must be revolutionary ideas that penetrate the hearts of the people, so he personally drafted the Three Principles of the People; second, there must be a definite way to build the country, so he wrote the Outline of National Construction and the National Strategy; third, the people must be able to clearly understand the current situation of the country and be deeply vigilant, so he drafted the First National Congress Declaration. With all of these, and with the people of the whole country fully understanding their meaning and value, China could slowly build itself up, become strong, and achieve the ultimate goal: the freedom and equality of the nation.</p>
<p>This was the ideological landscape of the Father of the Nation at the time of his death on March 12th of the 14th year of the Republic. In his will, the Father of the Nation also earnestly instructed future generations with this. The content of the will is now of course very familiar to everyone, but precisely because it is too familiar, it is easy to overlook the important meaning it contains. There are two sections in the will that are the most important. The first section is "I have devoted myself to the National Revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China." This refers to the goal and ideal of the Father of the Nation's lifelong revolution. The second section is "Recently advocating the convening of a National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties." This refers to the methods and steps to achieve this ideal.</p>
<p>The international status exchanged for blood and flesh - don't let it plummet</p>
<p>The meaning contained in these short sentences is especially worth reflecting on today. What is meant by "freedom and equality for China"? In terms of external meaning, China should have its independent and self-reliant international status, not be bound by any unilateral unequal treaties. It should have the power and courage to act independently in diplomacy, and not succumb to or compromise due to the influence of interests. In particular, the national dignity of China as an independent country must be fully recognized and respected by countries around the world. In terms of internal meaning, all ethnic groups, all regions, and all classes within the country should have the freedom and equality stipulated by national laws, and be fully respected and protected by national laws.</p>
<p>In this sense, our current situation is too far from the Father of the Nation's ideal. Here, we must note that after the victory in the Anti-Japanese War, when our longest and most vicious enemy, Japanese imperialism, surrendered, we originally had a great opportunity to gradually achieve this ideal of the Father of the Nation. Unfortunately, this opportunity was fleeting. Due to the outbreak of civil strife, destruction of transportation, stagnation of construction, soaring prices, and people's misery, the chaos in the political and economic order was even worse than during the Anti-Japanese War. As a result, the little international status that had been exchanged for the blood and flesh of millions of people in the eight-year Anti-Japanese War plummeted again. Does today's China have true freedom and equality in the international arena? On this day of the 22nd anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, this is the first point that every Chinese person should feel ashamed and vigilant about.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Father of the Nation said in his will that in order to achieve the goal of national freedom and equality, first, a National Assembly must be convened to achieve peaceful unification internally; second, unequal treaties must be abolished so that China can gain an autonomous position in the international arena. On the surface, it can be said that both of these have been successful. The National Assembly convened last November to December brought together national scholars to formulate the fundamental constitution of the country, allowing China to take a further step towards obtaining a unified rule of law. This was originally what the Father of the Nation had earnestly hoped for, and the Outline of National Construction also regarded the promulgation of the constitution and the success of constitutional government as the final stage of the nation-building process. The constitution that was passed this time was originally revised based on the principles of modification in the Political Consultative Conference, and should have satisfied the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). However, as a result, they still refused to participate in the National Assembly on the grounds of other reasons, and even closed the door to peace talks and consultations, making the constitution, which originally symbolized national democracy and unity, still hindered by force in its implementation.</p>
<p>Unequal treaties have been abolished, but unequal status has not been dispeled. As for unequal treaties, such as consular jurisdiction, stationing of troops, concession areas, and inland river navigation rights signed in the Manchu Qing Dynasty, have all been abolished near the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and replaced by new ones based on mutual equality. Originally, these unequal terms were all signed by the corrupt and incompetent Manchu Qing government, and the Republic after the revolution did not necessarily have to recognize them. However, at that time, because the power of the revolution was not yet fully united and stable, in order to take into account the practical difficulties, these unequal treaties had to be recognized as valid. However, the abolition of unequal treaties was something that the Father of the Nation never forgot until his death, and it was also something that the government has worked hard to achieve over the past twenty years. Finally, because of the courage and strength shown by the country in the Anti-Japanese War, it was sympathized and respected by the Allied countries. As early as May of the 30th year, China and the United States had preliminary discussions on abolishing unequal treaties. By January 11th of the 32nd year, the new treaties of equality between China and the United States and China and the United Kingdom had been signed. France and other countries also declared one after another that they would abandon all their privileges in China and sign new treaties. Unequal treaties that bound the Chinese nation for a hundred years were abolished.</p>
<p>The superficial unequal clauses have indeed been abolished, but in fact, has China's status in the international arena been truly equal? Whether a country can obtain equal status in the international arena mainly depends on whether the country has a unified and powerful force that makes people dare not despise it. At the Paris 21-nation peace conference last year, when discussing the Treaty of Peace with Germany, China's desire to be included in the invited countries was opposed. Now, the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference has also opened. In the discussion of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, China, with such deep economic relations with Germany, cannot even have a say. Moreover, it is said that this meeting may also involve China's internal affairs. How long has it been since the San Francisco Conference, China has fallen from one of the four or five powers to a problem to be discussed at the conference table, and its status is already like that of a small European country that was defeated in the war! Although unequal treaties have been abolished, unequal status still exists.</p>
<p>Using power to destroy the ice dragon will inevitably achieve independence and freedom</p>
<p>How can China truly lift the bonds of all unequal treaties and transform from a semi-colonial country into a truly independent and self-reliant country? Clearly, first, the country must be peacefully unified so that all forces can be concentrated, all destruction must be stopped immediately, and all chaos must be changed immediately. Second, take advantage of the favorable environment that the Japanese imperialists have been defeated and the external obstacles have been removed. Put all efforts into domestic construction. In this way, true freedom and equality can come.</p>
<p>Today, when we read the Father of the Nation's words "seek freedom and equality for China" in his will, our hearts are filled with infinite emotion and infinite shame. The Father of the Nation has been dead for twenty-two years, how much have we done of what he earnestly entrusted to us? We originally had the opportunity to achieve this ideal goal, but why are we so disappointing and sit idly by as this opportunity slips away? Think about it deeply today. The Father of the Nation has clearly pointed out our path, and Chairman Chiang, the successor of the Father of the Nation, has also repeatedly told us: what China needs most urgently now is: peace, democracy, unity, and construction. This is the only path ahead of us, and it is also the only entrustment that the Father of the Nation has left to us.</p>
<h3>Promote Afforestation Movement</h3>
<p>— Wu Guozhen</p>
<p>The afforestation movement was originally one of the seven basic movements for local construction stipulated by the central government. Tracing back to the 17th year of the Republic of China, when the warlords were pacified and the country was unified, the work of political tutelage and construction began. In view of the fact that all construction work must start from basic local affairs, the central government stipulated afforestation, road construction, sanitation, Baojia literacy, cooperation, and the promotion of domestic goods as seven basic local construction movements, leading the country to promote them consistently.</p>
<p>Since the afforestation movement is one of the seven basic construction movements, it has already had a history of ten years of promotion before the Anti-Japanese War. The ancients had a saying: "It takes one year to plant a tree, and ten years to grow timber." In order to enable this movement to continue for a long time, so as to achieve the effect of "ten years to grow timber," the central government further stipulated March 12th of each year, the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, as Arbor Day. Every year on this day, the people of the whole country commemorate the Father of the Nation on the one hand, and on the other hand, they follow the Father of the Nation's teaching of "making the best use of the land" and expand afforestation propaganda and hold afforestation demonstrations, using the action of practicing the legacy to commemorate the Father of the Nation, which is more meaningful and more practical than ordinary commemorative ceremonies.</p>
<p>Speaking of the relationship between the afforestation movement and China, since our country's agriculture developed very early, most of the primeval forests have been converted into farmland. It is very necessary to use the artificial afforestation movement to make up for the lack of natural evolution. The function of afforestation is not only to cultivate forests and increase national wealth, but also to regulate floods and droughts and prevent disasters. As for afforestation in cities, in addition to the above-mentioned functions, it also has the following two major functions.</p>
<p>(1) Improve hygiene - because cities have a dense population, industry and commerce gather, and the noise and smoke are far greater than in rural areas. The housing of ordinary people is mostly row upon row, crowded and narrow. Moreover, the places of work, whether factories or shops, and the places for leisure after work, whether theaters or tea houses, are mostly crowded together, which is detrimental to health. To make up for this kind of urban deformity, the only way is to plant more trees and establish more gardens to increase fresh air and benefit the population.</p>
<p>(2) Beautify the scenery - cities are the center of national economic culture, and should have beautified designs for international tourism and domestic sightseeing. The cultivation of natural scenery is a necessary condition for beautification. For example, the cultivation of gardens and the planting of roadside trees not only improve hygiene, but also have the function of beautifying.</p>
<p>Shanghai has a dense population and prosperous industry and commerce, and is the most urbanized city in the country. Since the Anti-Japanese War, after eight years of enemy puppet devastation, many trees have been destroyed and felled, and the forests and gardens have almost been abandoned. This year's March 12th is the first Arbor Day after the national government returned to the capital. It is especially appropriate to take this opportunity to promote the afforestation movement. In addition to various preparatory matters, which have been actively carried out by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Works Bureau in conjunction with relevant organizations and groups, it is hoped that all citizens will enthusiastically participate at that time to cultivate materials for the country and improve their own health, so as to receive permanent and endless benefits with the effort of raising a hand and a foot.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Arbor Day</h3>
<p>— Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, our task is not only to restore all pre-war construction, but also to surpass it. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his economic construction plan, once made it clear to us that the most important thing is industrial construction, and he also included afforestation in this plan.</p>
<p>Regarding the raw materials for industrial construction, the most important are of course steel and wood, which are the sources of industrial construction. Therefore, to assess the wealth of a country, one must estimate the domestic production of steel and wood.</p>
<p>Steel is stored in mineral lands. Our country's production can also rank fourth in the world. We only need the technology to mine it, and this problem is relatively easy to solve.</p>
<p>As for wood, we must find ways to cultivate it in order to increase production and avoid shortages. The main areas of wood production in our country are the three northeastern provinces, several southwestern provinces, and Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, and Hunan. Most other places are barren hills with very little wood production. If we want to increase wood production, promoting afforestation is indeed a necessary and urgent matter.</p>
<p>Wood has a wide range of uses. In industry, it is used for building materials, bridge materials, railway sleepers, and other materials such as paper pulp for papermaking and tung oil. As for edible uses, such as edible fruit trees, etc.</p>
<p>According to the classification of silviculturists, there are practical forest trees and landscape forest trees. This requires experts to describe, and I don't need to add detailed annotations.</p>
<p>Speaking of the benefits of afforestation, the industrial uses have been mentioned above. Other benefits include strengthening embankments, preventing floods, regulating climate, and increasing rainfall. It is also of great benefit to agriculture, water conservancy, and human health. This is also something that everyone often discusses and knows.</p>
<p>In principle, afforestation is naturally suitable for mountainous areas or open plains. In the Shanghai area, the afforestation to be promoted in urban areas is the planting of landscape trees in gardens. This can add a lot of green color to the dense city, increase the beauty of the cityscape, and also allow the dense city to obtain more air regulation and increase the health of citizens. In the suburbs, plant more fruit trees and some commercial trees, and take advantage of the concentration of talents in Shanghai to plant more seedlings, improve seedlings, and supply them to all parts of the country for purchase and planting.</p>
<p>Today is Arbor Day, also the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation. The central government stipulates this day, on the one hand, to commemorate the Father of the Nation, and on the other hand, to instruct us that tree planting is most suitable during this solar term. The tree-planting movement is being vigorously promoted and guided by the government, but the responsibility for widespread implementation still rests with the people themselves. And forestry experts and those engaged in forestry should also work harder. It is hoped that farmers will pay more attention and work harder. Shanghai is the largest city in the country and a hub of talent. We should set an example in all facilities, and afforestation and tree planting are naturally no exception.</p>
<h3>Small Matters of a Great Man</h3>
<p>— Compiled by this newspaper's data room</p>
<p>Reading: The Father of the Nation was naturally quiet and usually silent, but he loved to read. Whenever new books came out, he would try to find and buy those of more value. After buying them, he would wrap them in paper covers to avoid damage and dirt, and then read them carefully. The books on the shelf were all classified and placed in order, without any disorder. The Father of the Nation bought mostly books on geography, history, economics, politics, and military affairs, as well as ancient Chinese canonical books, but very few novels.</p>
<p>Chess Skills: The Father of the Nation had no interest in music, drama, or other entertainment, but he was very fond of Chinese chess. In his luggage, in addition to books and stationery, chess pieces and a chessboard were always included. The Father of the Nation was very serious when playing chess with others, and he would often play until late at night. His chess skills were also quite good, but he was always slightly inferior when playing against Hu Hanmin.</p>
<p>Daily Life: The Father of the Nation had a regular daily life. He would get out of bed at six or seven in the morning, and he would personally tidy up his bedclothes, quilts, and pillows, never relying on servants. The Father of the Nation loved cleanliness. He would take a bath every day, and he would change his underwear every day. When he lived in Nanyang, the weather was extremely hot, but the Father of the Nation never followed the local custom of taking off his hat and queue, and he never went barefoot or wore slippers when staying indoors.</p>
<p>Food: The Father of the Nation paid much attention to his diet. He used chopsticks for meals, not knives or forks, and he usually liked to eat vegetables. He ate very little fish and meat. He never touched alcohol or tobacco, but he was very fond of eating fruit, especially bananas and pineapples. When he lived on Rue Molière in Shanghai, he would always ask servants to go out and buy them for him.</p>
<p>Language: The Father of the Nation usually spoke the Guangzhou dialect, but he used Mandarin when giving speeches. His tone was slow, heavy, and orderly, and all who heard him were moved. The Father of the Nation spoke English fluently, but he never spoke it in conversation or speeches unless it was necessary. The Father of the Nation was kind and rarely angry. When he lived in Shanghai, his servant, Chen He, was quite foolish. When things did not go as he wished, the Father of the Nation would scold him, saying "Da Pao He," but this was rarely heard. "Da Pao He" is Cantonese for "foolish silkworm."</p>
<p>Liver Disease: On November 13 of the thirteenth year of the Republic, the Father of the Nation, on the day of his birthday, left Guangzhou for the north to seek a national conference in the north to seek unity and peace. On December 4, he arrived in Tianjin. Due to the long journey and fatigue, he caught a cold and felt unwell in his liver. He sought medical treatment, and by the end of the year, his illness had worsened. He went to Beijing while ill and underwent an autopsy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. He learned that his entire liver was as hard as wood and that his liver cancer was in its terminal stage.</p>
<p>Death: In early March of the fourteenth year of the Republic, the Father of the Nation's illness worsened, his pulse accelerated, reaching 150 to 160 beats per minute, and his breathing decreased, sometimes only 17 or 18 breaths. On the afternoon of March 11, he was supported by his wife to sign the pre-prepared will. He slept peacefully for several hours in the afternoon. He woke up at 6:30, his hands and feet gradually became cold, and he could not speak much. He only intermittently said "Peace... Struggle... Save China..." At 9:30 on the morning of March 12, this great man passed away.</p>
<p>Funeral: After the death of the Father of the Nation, the people of the whole country mourned him. On the day of the funeral, more than 20,000 people outside Xizhimen held ropes and cried bitterly. When the Father of the Nation passed away, he left two wills: one to his comrades in the party and one to his family. The following year, Dai Chuanxian suggested to the central government that the will should be read respectfully at every meeting to commemorate him and never forget him. After the central government approved it, it ordered the whole country to follow it, and it has been followed to this day.</p>

<h3>The Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription for the Father of the Nation When He Was Critically Ill</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, went north in the winter of the thirteenth year of the Republic. Because he suffered from terminal liver cancer, he consulted Chinese and foreign doctors in Tianjin and Beiping for treatment. He passed away in Beiping on March 12 of the fourteenth year of the Republic. However, according to an English report from Liu Ruiheng, the president of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, to Kong Xiangxi and forwarded to Mr. Sun's family and Kuomintang members on February 17, "Upon Mr. Sun's admission to our hospital, it was discovered that he was suffering from terminal liver cancer, which is an incurable disease. After dissection and microscopic examination of the outer skin of the cancer, the diagnosis was confirmed. The condition went from bad to extremely bad. We believe that there is no hope for Mr. Sun's survival." Therefore, the next day, Mr. Sun was moved from Peking Union Medical College Hospital to the Gu residence in Tieshizi Hutong for treatment. At that time, Zhang Jingjiang, Hu Shih, and others appointed traditional Chinese medicine doctor Lu Zhong'an to examine him. After Dr. Lu prescribed one dose of Astragalus and Codonopsis, the leg swelling completely disappeared. On the 20th, after another diagnosis, the soup and medicine were decocted and drunk. Dr. 克禮's examination report showed that blood circulation had gradually improved. Lunch and diet were the same as when he was not sick, and he was able to sleep peacefully for seven or eight hours. However, because the disease had become deep-rooted and the report from Peking Union Medical College Hospital had already declared that there was no hope, Mr. Sun still fought the disease with great fearlessness, so he was able to extend his time for more than 20 days before passing away. At that time, Lu Zhong'an's diagnosis and prescription were given general attention. Now, I will record the pulse case and prescription he prescribed: Fright, panic, and anger all injure the liver meridian. Blood boils and qi stagnates, causing congestion and blockage, which turns into liver hardening. Hardening leads to carbuncles, which fester over time. The mechanism of ascension and descension is lost, and blood and qi are greatly depleted. Therefore, the spirit is tired, appetite is poor, feet are swollen, the body is thin, the tongue is dry, the coating is peeled off, the pulse is strong and rapid, and it is rootless when pressed. The Inner Canon takes the liver as the general's office, and the ministerial fire is hidden within. If it is nourished by true water and subdued by true qi, it can be effective. I respectfully prescribe the following prescription for consideration.</p>
<p>3 mace of Dendrobium loddigesii Rolfe</p>
<p>3 mace of Wild Mountain Ginseng</p>
<p>3 mace of Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc.</p>
<p>4 mace of Ophiopogon japonicus (Linn. f.) Ker-Gawl.</p>
<p>4 mace of Fresh Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch.</p>
<p>3 mace of Astragalus complanatus R.Br.</p>
<p>3 mace of Adenophora stricta Miq.</p>
<p>2 mace of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.</p>
<p>To be honest, Mr. Sun's illness was treated by several famous doctors, and radium needles were used for more than 40 hours, but there was no effect. It was said that the doctors were helpless and the medicine was ineffective. Lu Zhong'an's medicine was nothing more than fulfilling human affairs. Now, after a lapse of twenty-two years, recording his pulse case and prescription is nothing more than leaving a memorial for the traditional Chinese medicine community.</p>
<h3>Big Style</h3>
<p>— By 法·日耳韋司, translated by 李青厓</p>
<p>You know my wife and me very well, and you certainly wouldn't put us in the category of those who only want to save pennies by accumulating small amounts and don't want to be comfortable for once. So when you heard that my uncle of 賽爾 passed away and left me an inheritance, you certainly wouldn't think it strange that we made a big change in our lives. At that time, in matters related to me, the first thing I paid attention to was leaving my position at the 法布 Company, where I had worked for fifteen years, in a definite way. Ha, don't worry, I have already handled that matter with the most reasonable procedure and apologized earnestly to the respected general manager. This amazing man, who had already known about this matter, said to me:</p>
<p>"I fully agree with you, my good friend."</p>
<p>Please note, since I became a millionaire, he has called me "good friend." Before, he simply called me "friend." These are just small things, of course, but they make me happy and prove that you have also climbed a few steps on the social ladder.</p>
<p>Many other changes followed. The apartment we used to live in became irritating to our new status. So we abandoned it and found another, larger and more sophisticated apartment. On the day of the move, my wife said to me:</p>
<p>"For me, there are too many things here. And I don't want to continue washing pots and waxing floors like I did when I was poor. If you agree, we'll hire a female worker."</p>
<p>These words seemed completely reasonable to me. So we went to a employment agency, and my wife explained her needs: an upright person with automatic service experience who doesn't need supervision.</p>
<p>"I understand what you mean," said the manager of the agency. "A skilled maid who has worked in upper-class families. I will send her to your house tomorrow."</p>
<p>The second day, we saw her arrive. Her name was 克樂蒂德. She was a woman of medium build, neither old nor young, neither ugly nor beautiful, but her ordinary face showed a kind of contempt of unknown origin gained from long service. My wife asked her without malice:</p>
<p>"Are you the maid sent by the agency?"</p>
<p>She hurriedly replied in a correcting tone:</p>
<p>"I am the housekeeper that the manager of the agency told Madame about!"</p>
<p>The people at the agency really didn't misunderstand us. Probably, no servant has ever been able to produce such noteworthy references. There were not many documents, but they were all worded extremely appropriately and signed by several of the most prominent aristocratic families.</p>
<p>"I have always worked in the Saint-Germain district," she said to us. "Unfortunately, it is not easy to find a position in that area today! There has been too much destruction in the past few years!"</p>
<p>In the beginning, we were a little uncomfortable because of 克樂蒂德. It inevitably produced a strange feeling when we first decided to have a stranger live in our home. And I think this should also produce a strange feeling for someone who doesn't live in a stranger's house. But 克樂蒂德, she had already taken it for granted. Under our roof, she seemed completely at ease, much more so than we felt about that level, because we hadn't had time to get used to the new apartment.</p>
<p>Apart from this, our maid - I mean, our housekeeper - was completely satisfactory to us, as could be judged by such unremarkable employers as we were. Her service was perfect. She only asked us to add a floor polisher to keep the floors clean and a part-time seamstress to handle various mending matters. Such requests from such an outstanding servant were truly irresistible!</p>
<p>So, 克樂蒂德 was a pearl! Indispensable for people like us who were just starting out. Not content with performing tasks in an impeccable manner, she seemed to assume an obligation to announce obligations to us. Alas! Holding many talents for improvising and thinking deeply, and without openly listing any criticisms or instructions. Please note, here is an example I have taken from thousands of examples: We bought a set of modern furniture in the dining room, with a folding table that used to be there and is still there, very beautiful, my goodness. In the beginning, my wife followed her usual practice and laid a carpet on it. Who knew that this carpet would strike at 克樂蒂德's concept of beauty. Silently, she removed it. My wife put it back on, and she removed it again. In the end, my wife understood and put the carpet away.</p>
<p>After 克樂蒂德 finished this matter with her female employer, she was even willing to pay attention to me. At first, I thought this was good. Can I confess this to you? When fortune first came upon us, I had never worn a swallowtail dress or a smoking jacket. That is why 克樂蒂德, when the time came, used thoughtful methods to guide me on which one to wear. Likewise, she knew how to make me pay attention to correcting certain mistakes. One evening, just as we were about to go out, I heard her say to me:</p>
<p>"麥薛 is a little careless this evening!"</p>
<p>"Why, 克樂蒂德?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Because 麥薛 made a mistake. 麥薛 put on a swallowtail coat and fastened a black bow tie."</p>
<p>I hadn't heard of this small detail: you have to wear a white bow tie with a swallowtail coat! Later, 克樂蒂德 continued her work, strictly adhering to a regulation of wearing yellow leather shoes and floral shirts, and these were the details that I had always performed the worst. And that wasn't the only sacrifice she knew to add to my personal tastes. I also had to eliminate my still too vulgar language, and in a twisted attitude, give up my habit of stuffing rice dumplings into the mouth of my vest, give up my pipe to smoke cigars, and give up playing 貝育特的 cards to play bridge.</p>
<p>We not only changed the menu at home to suit this loyal servant, but I tell you, 麥薛, we also had to often sneak into restaurants to eat certain dishes that were not suitable for our new environment: such as 酸燴小牛頭, 伽恩州做法的臟腑, fisherman-style fresh mussels, and the like.</p>
<p>Such multifaceted efforts unfolded by our outstanding housekeeper were not without effect. Slowly, but surely, we made progress in comfortable living. Perhaps we could finally transform into a pair of the most presentable social people if an unexpected change did not suddenly jeopardize our education.</p>
<p>One morning, we wasted time waiting for 克爾蒂德 to come to work. So my wife went to the bedroom of this model servant to see her, but she was not in the bedroom. Suspecting something, we made a circle around the house: we found that our pearl had disappeared along with our silver tabletop, some jewelry, and other decorations. ...</p>
<p>You ask if I reported it to the police? My goodness, 麥薛, I should tell you that we didn't! We, my wife and I, were so satisfied at the time with what had fallen upon us. (Translated from the French 中国邮报周刊)</p>
<h3>Snippets on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Hu Ne</p>
<p>Poetry is like sweet dew, nourishing our parched lives.</p>
<p>Poetry that is divorced from reality, that sings of the wind and moon; poetry that lives in an ivory tower; poetry that is beautiful in appearance but poor in content; this era no longer needs it.</p>
<p>We want the accusations of the masses, the grievances from the bottom of our hearts, the reflection of reality, poetry with flesh and blood!</p>
<h3>Tang Dynasty Dance Costume</h3>
<p>— Ming Yu</p>
<h3>On the Tang Dynasty Dance Costume Painted by Ms. Ming Yu</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>The prosperity of dance and music was praised in the Tang Dynasty, and the systems of the Jiaofang Bureau were passed down. The customs of the Central Plains and the Western Regions were all appropriate, and the teams were arranged like an army. Later generations of culture and education lost the etiquette, and the Ming Dynasty's atmosphere moved with the stars. The paintings in the Mogao Caves preserve the customs, and a glimpse can be seen. In recent years, scholars have been fascinated, traveling thousands of miles to the Western border, painstakingly copying and pursuing, forgetting their fatigue, and seeing a new banner in the art world. It must be known that the skills of craftsmen are uneven, and the merit of examining ancient customs can be used. In taking the law, it is necessary to distinguish between the pure and the flawed, and to plagiarize blindly is only to deceive oneself. Now, new ideas come out of the loom, and following blindly is not following the blind. Drawing from the past and promoting the new lies here, and lacking one basket of soil will ruin all the work.</p>
<h3>Distant Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Separation allows us to savor the meaning of reunion; with separation, we cherish the time of coming together even more. Fate is impermanent; it is the trickster of life. Countless emotions can only be conveyed silently and remotely through the merging of souls.</p>
<p>You say that the surroundings are dry and desolate, like an endless desert, with no trace of green oasis to be seen. But I, too, can only find a little warmth and comfort in your letters, in the words of the past. The climate should be echoing the warmth of spring day by day, but when will it shine on our side?</p>
<p>This is an era of tormenting young people, no, an era of training young people. The sensitive tentacles of thought - we are eager to develop in every direction, but we inevitably reflect back disappointment and pessimism! - We remember bravely encouraging each other not to sigh, which only more obviously reveals the emptiness of the heart, doesn't it. What's the use? I am sure that you are still often...</p>
<p>We worry about life and respect life. Life is solemn, and for its sake, we have endured all the costs. Even if the torment of emotions is painful, let the brilliance shine in the taste of tears, and we place our hopes on the future.</p>
<p>Sweeping across the long passage of time, the distant space, in an atmosphere of loneliness, we proudly are not lonely after all. The floating clouds in the sky, the moon, the familiar soil under our feet - we are always connecting them and delivering the same care.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 196</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This time, as soon as I heard Yaoqun about to read out the order, I noticed that the lights in the hall, as if changing bulbs, suddenly flickered twice, and then flickered twice again. This was a warning signal. However, if I hadn't heard Yaoqun read out the first alarm, I would never have noticed this second alarm, because the flickering of the lights was common in Beiping, saying that the Beiping generator was too old and often had problems. After the lights flickered, I saw Yaoqun's pupils quickly reflect twice, which was exactly the natural preparation of the pupils; this proved that she had not been hypnotized (because the eyes of the subject are either wide open or closed, but they will never flicker). At the same time, I saw her eyes focused on the ground not far from us, with a very nervous expression, so I followed her gaze, and only then did I discover that in the place where the lights on the ground cast yin and yang shadows, there was a very faint shadow flickering. After carefully identifying the intervals of the flickering, I realized that it was the telegram from the headquarters.</p>
<p>This communication method was installed extremely cleverly; it only required a small telegraph key panel, one end connected to the total money of the electric meter, and the other end connected to a transformer, with a telegraph button installed in the middle to control the current. Touching this button would cause all the electric lights to flicker, one dark and one bright.</p>
<p>But at this time, the lights in the hall did not all flicker obviously. Only by carefully watching the places where shadows of different sizes and light intensities were cast could one vaguely see the flickering action. I thought that perhaps only one small light in the many lights in the hall was connected to a transformer, so the flickering was imperceptible; otherwise, would a cunning spy like "Commander Jin" be able to escape her notice if all the lights were to flicker together? But from this point, it can also be seen that Yaoqun's alertness is truly beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p>
<p>While Yaoqun was reading the telegram order, the situation on Hejian's side suddenly changed again. After hearing Hejian announce his identity and name, the female commander had already changed from strengthening to softening. I don't know what happened, maybe Hejian made a joke or two to her, but the guy's attitude suddenly became tough again. Because I was listening to Yaoqun read out the telegram and searching for the source of the flickering lights, I didn't pay attention to the cause of the changes on Hejian's side; at this time, I only heard the so-called "Commander Jin" repeatedly pressing Hejian to provide proof of identity, otherwise, she would carry out a full search according to the order, but Hejian was still smiling and speaking irregular and stiff Japanese:</p>
<p>"Search, yes, search! But today I came from 松井, and I haven't heard of this "Garrison Command"... Which side is this department on; is it Japanese? Or Chinese? Or is it jointly run by both sides? ..."</p>
<p>As Hejian said this, I saw the color on the face of the so-called "Commander Jin" become extremely ugly, which showed that she had become extremely angry, and only a slight touch was needed to make her explode. While they were arguing, Yaoqun, who was standing beside me, suddenly gently told me and Little Tiger, "Our people are all down!" I slightly turned my head and glanced at the dining seats in the hall. I didn't know when, people had gathered around a dozen tables, some with three or four people at a table, some with one or two people, and even our big fool "〇四" was squeezing at a table with his men. What surprised me even more was that among these people, there was a table where Mr. Dai, Mr. Ma, and Mr. W were sitting upright. Several waiters, like colorful butterflies, were gliding and fluttering, busily coming and going between the tables, delivering tea, snacks, coffee, cold drinks, etc. As for when he came, because I was fully focused on Hejian's side, I simply had no awareness.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>"Chicken and Eggs"</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhimin</p>
<p>The City Council's discussion on unfreezing the cost of living index caused quite a stir. (Details can be found in the "New Sun" column of this newspaper on the 9th.)</p>
<p>However, the impassioned pleas of two councilors at the meeting are worth mentioning again.</p>
<p>"If the chicken is finished, where will the eggs come from?" This major question is indeed worth the government's consideration.</p>
<p>The workers are the chickens. The cost of living index is the chicken feed, but in this environment of economic collapse, the chickens themselves do not hope to eat white rice. All they ask for is a little bit of bran that can prolong their lives. After all, the chickens still have to lay eggs.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the government only hopes that the chickens lay eggs and does not give them the minimum feed, then, "Where will the eggs come from?" If the production of eggs is truly cut off, what will happen to the "egg bosses" who rely on the chickens for survival?</p>
<h3>Facing the Taiwan Incident Squarely</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>According to an Associated Press report on the 8th: Demonstration movements occurred in Taiwan, led by Taiwanese people repatriated from Japan and Hainan Island, showing their political colors for the first time, shouting slogans... This is such eye-catching news!</p>
<p>There was no "disturbance" when Taiwan was taken over, but the disturbance arose a year after the takeover. This is not an accidental event. The useful things left behind by the Japanese are not nonexistent, but they have not been fully utilized. And what was brought from the motherland? People longed for rain in a drought, but what did they get? — A cruel storm! Fifty years is not a short period! Chairman Chiang brought the warmth of the motherland, but as soon as the Chairman left, the current reality drove away the warmth. Inner hope is hope, but fact is fact. Who wouldn't be disappointed?</p>
<p>"Everything will be fine after the victory!" Everyone had such hope, but this "solution" was occupied by a few people. What other solution is there?</p>
<p>Now the incident has "political color," and the "demonstration" movement is "led by Taiwanese people repatriated from Japan and Hainan Island." What exactly is going on? The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. It is worth our deep thought.</p>
<h3>The Fox Killing Record</h3>
<p>— Jianhua</p>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday that the Qingxian Cotton Mill on Jianguo Road in this city has experienced strange fires in the past three days due to the haunting of a fox spirit, resulting in a loss of as much as 150 million yuan. The talk of the streets is full of wonder.</p>
<p>In this atomic age, the theory of fox hauntings is difficult to establish. The strange fires at the factory are exactly the same as the fact that Battalion Commander Yang killed a fox. I will record it below as a reference for the factory's investigation:</p>
<p>Outside Shangwen Gate in this city, there is a temple, not very famous, which is said to be inhabited by a fox spirit. It is known for its spiritual efficacy in seeking wealth and asking about illnesses. The incense is flourishing, attracting people from near and far. In the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], anti-Japanese troops gathered in southern Shanghai, suffering from a lack of accommodation. Battalion Commander Yang of a certain battalion saw that the location of the temple was suitable and sufficient for use, so he asked the monks of the temple for permission to reside there. The monk said that there was a fox spirit in the temple and feared that it would be difficult to settle down. Battalion Commander Yang did not believe him, scoffed at it as nonsense, and personally led several movements into the temple, arranging everything. Yang saw a spirit tablet in the meditation hall, said to be the fox spirit, covered with a ceiling. The paint was new, the windows were bright, and the tables were clean, and the sound of the bell was clear. Yang immediately wrote a note in the chanting hall and ordered the soldiers to post it outside the door, designating it as the camp's garrison. At that time, there was nothing different. The next day, the soldiers arrived, and just as they were unloading their luggage, they looked at each other in surprise. What was coming? The juice was all over the blankets. The monk folded his palms and said that it must be the work of the great immortal, so there was this anomaly. Yang still did not believe it. Unexpectedly, in three days, there were more than ten strange fires. Not only did they burn bedding, but even the documents on the table could spontaneously ignite. Battalion Commander Yang was filled with doubt and burned incense and lit candles to worship in front of the spirit tablet, and ordered the soldiers not to enter the meditation hall without permission, so as not to disturb the great immortal. At the same time, a yellow paper suddenly fell slowly from the dogwood ceiling, on which were written the words "Please stay elsewhere, or don't blame me." Battalion Commander Yang had a flash of inspiration and immediately pulled out his pistol and fired several shots at the ceiling. Immediately, he found fresh red blood dripping down. He was greatly surprised, and went to the pavilion to verify it. An old monk was curled up in the pavilion, his head and chest had been shot, and blood was flowing like a flood, he was dead. Battalion Commander Yang then knew that the monk was deliberately playing tricks, pretending to be a fox spirit, in order to prevent the borrowing of the house. He searched the monks of the temple and found two leather hides, a glass bottle, a leather bag containing dung juice, with a copper pipe installed on it, the pipe was not plugged, and could be rotated left and right. If it was rotated to the right, the hole would appear, and if it was rotated to the left, the hole would be closed, like a dripping bottle. There were several pieces of pity in the glass bottle, half of which had been used. The crowd was angry and wanted to kill him, but after a certain gentleman's plea, they let it go.</p>
<p>It is found that once the phosphorus is dissolved, it can catch fire. The strange fire in the cotton mill on Jianguo Road may also be caused by people.</p>
<h3>Words Still Ring in My Ears</h3>
<p>— Yu Wangwo (artist)</p>
<p>The team leaders' meeting decided not to discuss the China issue</p>
<h3>"Vanguard for the People" — A Short Record of a Traitor's Change of Face</h3>
<p>— Changliu</p>
<p>Hu Shih told reporters that students cannot be blamed for being interested in politics now because the country has been in turmoil for years. This statement seems applicable to the problem of traitors.</p>
<p>The traitor problem, in a certain period, that is, during the period when reserve notes were two hundred to one, the "wind" was indeed quite "tight" for a while, because "what you sow is what you reap." The "traitors" who had served the enemy puppets with "dog and horse labor" should naturally be "punished."</p>
<p>However, many traitors, like "reserve notes," have greatly changed their faces after the "two hundred to one" "conversion" stage. It's a bit like Sun Wukong plucking a "hair" from his body, shouting "Change!" and wiping his face, the "monkey spirit" may immediately turn into a charming eighteen-year-old girl, or a representative of public opinion who has gone through some kind of election, or even a neatly dressed and majestic "chief" or the like. Therefore, those "loyal dogs and horses" who were "despised" in their hearts also didn't care at all, shouting "Long live..." in front of the "meeting as usual"; and also posing as one of the leaders who lead the masses with "bear-like gestures", showing their style.</p>
<p>For example, those "musicians" who composed something like the "Greater East Asia March" for the "Japanese fathers" are now actually greatly moaning about "how difficult the arduous resistance against Japan" for the motherland in their song lyrics.</p>
<p>On their faces, they still look radiant, carrying the big sign of "Vanguard for the People."</p>
<p>——When there is a shortage of talent, traitors can also serve the country!</p>
<p>Therefore, translating books (those already in prison), composing music, directing movies, performing plays, is exactly "giving strength if you have strength" and "giving talent if you have talent" (talent meaning talent), making brilliant contributions in many ways!</p>
<p>But mainly, we cannot forget Hu Shih's phrase, the motherland has been in turmoil for years, everyone is tightening their belts and doesn't even have time, who still cares about ethics, morals, what about being a bastard for the "Japanese fathers" and so on, what "traitors" and what "puppets"!</p>
<p>Eating is important, everyone is too busy to take care of themselves, so you have your numbers, and I have my numbers, and we can only sigh with disappointment.</p>
<p>Edward Robinson and Joan Bennett in "Scarlet Street"</p>
<h3>Wangxian Gate</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>Foreign soldiers visited foreign prostitutes and fell into a soy sauce vat</p>
<p>— See the Beiping Correspondence of Ta Kung Pao</p>
<p>Foreign soldiers secretly visit foreign prostitutes, "Phoenix seeks the male"; foreign soldiers see military police and panic, wanting to escape!</p>
<p>Learning cleverly from "Zhang Junrui", they hurriedly jumped over the high wall, but accidentally fell into a soy sauce vat! Soy sauce vat, out crawled a big cockroach!</p>
<h3>Oscar Wilde and the Audience</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Once, the play of the aesthete Oscar Wilde was performed on stage and met with great failure. That night he went to the club. Someone asked him:</p>
<p>"Oscar (his name), how was your play performed tonight?"</p>
<p>"Oh," the writer replied proudly, "the play was a great success, but the audience was a great failure."</p>
<h3>Introducing "Scarlet Street"</h3>
<p>— Bicheng</p>
<p>"Scarlet Street" tells us a real story. It is not as heartbreaking as "The Constant Nymph." It is hot, it is bloody, but it is not unfamiliar.</p>
<p>A fifty-year-old middle-aged man, who has served in the accounting department for twenty years, has no passionate love, no great career, and naturally no money to spend lavishly in his life. He just lives diligently, loyally, and ordinarily. Is he really very satisfied? Of course not, just as he said: "In the depths of the heart, there is always something stuck." He can't say what it is, it's been too long. It has been hidden in his heart for ten or even twenty years. One day, the dust on its surface is suddenly blown away by a gentle breeze, so it becomes clear and prominent again. It is "love," it is "desire." After many years of deep hiding, once it comes out, it becomes stronger and more powerful. Middle-aged people are not easy to be infatuated, but once they are infatuated, the degree must be deeper and more difficult to extricate themselves than young people.</p>
<p>Because there were scenes of theft and murder in the film, it is said that it was even banned in the United States for a time, but it was finally lifted. The reason is that the filming of the film should be able to reflect reality. When theft and murder have not been eradicated in real life for a day, it is impossible not to have similar shots on the screen.</p>
<p>"Scarlet Street" has scenes of theft and murder, but I feel that it has given me a lesson. Moreover, under the joint performance of Edward Robinson and Joan Bennett, it has great artistic achievements. It was selected as one of the famous films, and it was not a fluke.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay! Stop talking! Okay?" Lao Zhu made a vomiting gesture. "I've heard enough of your high-sounding theories! In the mouths of you businessmen, materials are always the most important thing, with materials there is resistance against Japan, with materials there is a country. It's really brilliant! But only..."</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming interjected triumphantly, interrupting the other party's words.</p>
<p>"Of course! Isn't the war with foreign countries for the sake of fighting for materials?"</p>
<p>"Brilliant! Brilliant!" Zhu Zhaonian said with a hippie smile: "But there is one thing missing: if no one fights well on the front line, one day, your materials will have nowhere to be robbed, nowhere to be transported! Unless you transport them to the Himalayas!"</p>
<p>"But the soldiers on the front line also have to eat and dress. If there are no materials, what do you teach them to wear and eat?" Xu Shaoming wiped the sweat from his face with a snow-white handkerchief, while feeling justified.</p>
<p>"Are the materials you are robbing and transporting to supply the soldiers with food and clothing? Brother, don't deceive yourself!" Lao Zhu couldn't help but add a contemptuous sneer. "What kind of materials are you robbing and transporting? To be honest, the country doesn't need this kind of materials at all! Now that the resistance against Japan has reached this point, ladies should also suffer a little! What's the use of robbing and transporting these luxuries? If everyone only talks about robbing and transporting this kind of materials, brother, I'm not saying big words to scare you, maybe your materials haven't been transported to Chongqing yet, and the enemy is waiting for you there early in the morning!"</p>
<p>Fatty Xu seemed to be a little horrified by what he said; but these few words were certainly not enough to change his prejudice (11)</p>
