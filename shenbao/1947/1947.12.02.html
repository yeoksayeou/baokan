<p>〔本報南京一日電〕五院組織法正在立院法規委會小組會審查中。閣各院之組織將略有變更如立院將增衞生委會，監院之監察使署亦將鵝變動。一日小組會開會討論，尙未獲得結果。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國務會議前曾送交立院議案一件，請草擬條例。該案之提出，係由於我國政黨繁多惟究何者爲合法，則無明文規定，尤以參加大選時，對政黨提各有所出入，雖經國務會議非正式決定，以凡參加制憲之政黨爲合法，但究乏成規可循，因交立院草擬正式法規。立院一日召集小組會議，討論關於政治社團組織之原則，當以此項法規不僅我國史無前例，即歐西亦乏成規參考，旋決定移交將來民選立院辦理。　　〔又電〕政黨提名立委候選人之名額配合問題，前經國民黨分邀民靑兩黨舉行九人小組會討論，未獲解決。民社黨徐傳霖等已於卅日夜車赴滬，召集中常會討論。靑年黨在京商決後，即於一日以覆函一件送國民黨，表示原提名單已無法再予變動。因此，立委名單之配合，尙待研究。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市民社黨主委候選人，已內定爲張君勵。該黨昨日午後樂行中常會，洽商立委候選人之地區分配問題。會後某要員表示：「立委與國代不同，每一區平均可產生五人，多者至六人，立委七百餘人中，民靑兩黨僅各佔七十五人之少數，地區之分配一節，深信當局終有解決辦法，故今日黨內會商結果，不擬將原定計劃大加變更。關於國代選舉，因選舉結果尙未正式公吿，故暫保留討論。至於民靑兩黨黨員參加各地參議會比列之技術問題，現正由靑年黨與國民黨中央洽商中」。</p>

<h3>遠東共產情報局的設立</h3>
<p>共產國際繼歐洲情報局成立之後，又在遠東籌組情報局之　，我們早於上月中獲得新聞社的報導。據美國聯合社十一月十六日從香港傳來的消息，我們已知在遠東各地的共產黨，正預備從歐洲各國共產黨在南斯拉夫首都伯爾格來德成立情報局之後，在遠東組設情報局，並定於十一月二十日在哈爾濱召開會議，宣告成立，頒發宣言。到了上月廿九日，英國的路透社又傳來消息，謂遠東共產情報局已於十一月廿日在哈爾濱成立，參加成立會議者有蘇聯，外蒙，中國，朝鮮各地共黨代表，日本共黨代表則以不獲出境護照，未能出席；當經大會決議設立遠東共產情報局及遠東各國自治奮鬥中之密切合作，與共產革命之推進。據同日美國聯合社電訊。遠東共黨情報局決定設立於海參崴；該社同日從倫敦傳來的報導，亦已證實遠東各地共產黨有召開會議，成立情報局之計劃。至是，我們可知共產國際在遠東經已召開會議，設立情報局，並擬在遠東各地推進共產革命，加緊彼此合作。我們到現在雖還不曾有機會能够讀到此一會議所發表的宣言，但此一宣言，在實際上，並無多大意義。我們已經看見共產國際成立歐洲情報局的宣言；遠東共產情報局繼之而成立，其所發表宣言，與歐洲的這一個宣言，在本質上，是不致會有什麽岐異的，即有距離，似乎也相差不會過遠。我們現在之所以沒有讀到這一個宣言，也許共產國際要選擇一個他們所認爲適當的發表時機。</p>
<p>對於此一消息的傳來，我們並不感覺到驚奇。當十月間共產國際在歐洲成立情報局的時候，我們曾說，歐洲共產情報局的出現，不能說是國際上的一種新壁壘，而是共產國際的再出現。共產國際原是早已存在了的，它的出現在國際政治舞台不自今日始。一九四三年五月共產國際的宣告解散。爲的是要討好西方民主國家，特別是要獲得美國的大量租借法案物資，於是克拉姆宮便以一紙公告，將這在列甯時代便已成立了的共產國際宣布解散，無百是莫斯科所玩的一套手法，對於國際共產運動，世界革命運動初不因共產國際的宣告解散而蒙受影響。所以共產國際以歐洲共產情報局的姿態出現，決不是一種新壁壘的出現，而是一種已經成在的老壁壘，重新掛上了旗號，準備宣戰。既然如此，則共產國際之在遠東同以成立情報局的姿態出現，自在意中，不足驚奇。</p>
<p>由於遠東共產黨情報局的成立，我國認爲應該加以指出的，有下列的若干點：</p>
<p>第一，共產黨是一種國際的組織，各地的共產黨有「信仰」上的一致，中國的共產黨自然也不能例外。在過去有一個時候，中國共產黨竭力企圖拉攏英美，因而他們自己以爲祇是農民革新黨，與在別國的共產黨性質不同。這是他們爲掩飾自己而爲的歪曲的宣傳，乃不意竟有英美人士信以爲眞，代中國共產黨作了宣傳，更遺憾的是：竟也有高級外交人員，身膺大使之任的人，也這樣不加思慮地做了中國共產黨的應聲蟲。如今共產黨的眞面目，益爲世人所熟知，中國共產黨也參加了遠東情報局的組織，則其所謂農民革新運動，自不能再欺世人。我們於此要指出的是：中國共產黨是共產國際推進世界革命的一環，它原沒有獨立的存在。遠東共產情報局的成立，更證實了這一宗事實。我們要明告世人不要再中了共黨宣傳的毒。</p>
<p>第二，由於遠東情報局的成立，及哈爾濱會議所通過的決議，我們可以預料到此後共產黨在遠東各地的活躍，必將更趨積極。在中國的東北及華北各地，中國共產黨既蓄意破壞，我政府不能不動員戡亂。同樣的事態，也可能在遠東其它各地出現。在趙南，在非列賓，在緬甸，在馬來亞等地，都潛伏著大量的共黨份子，他們在各地區多已積極展開活動，也可能從日本軍隊方面接收了大量軍火。他們可以選擇一個時機，同樣在各地展開武裝鬥爭運動。中國二十多年來飽嘗了共產黨的災禍，我們對於共黨的技倆是熟知的。由於共產遠東情報局的成立，我們要提高世人對於共產黨的警覺。</p>
<p>第三，由於遠東共產情報局的成立，益暴露了共產國際對世界革命的眞面目。這使我們想起我國目前的戡亂，彷彿宛如當年我們的獨力抗日，然其艱苦卻更倍於當年。當年我們有一個明顯的外敵，如今我們的敵人，卻沒有當年日本軍閥那樣的明顯；但其爲患，因其具有國際的前景，卻遠較當年的日本軍閥爲甚。我們於此要提高國人對於當前我們的敵人的警覺，一致動員，參加戡亂；一面要促請世人的注意，在各地共產黨準備推進世界革命的今日，只有我們中國在獨力對著我們的敵人，實亦是世界的亂。我們願世界各國人士能正視我們動員戡亂所具的世界意義，進而對世界整個戡亂能有新的計劃和新的決策；必如此，世界的持久和平繼能確保。</p>

<h3>殷汝耕槍決經過</h3>
<p>（上接一版）一日晨十時一刻，監刑檢察官王文俊偕同典獄長徐崇文，書記官吳景新，於設在刑塲附近犯人工房開臨時法庭。十時廿分，殷逆提到，著深藍色綢面絲棉袍，領口敞開，下穿藍綢棉褲，黑使鞋，頭戴米色絨繩瓜皮帽，面甚豐腴，然警悸之狀見於言表，形色慘白，手足失措。　上訊其姓名年籍後，復依例部其所犯何罪？殷逆吶然不欲回答。迨庭上詢以是否漢奸罪案時，遲疑半日，始啞然稱：「大概是！」似不勝愧悔者。旋庭上宣稱：司法行政部執行令業經最高法院轉下，即刻執行。股逆乃就坐書貴書，於強作鎭定之神情中，首書金剛經四句偈云：「一切有爲法，如夢幻泡影，如霧亦如電，應作如是觀。」繼作書與史，弟，子，女，妻，妾及辯護律師章士釗與其車夫張脊根等，達七封，歷時逾半句鐘，盡祇方畢。至此，殷逆復請行刑者爽快將事，減少痛苦，並懇靜坐受刑，俾可念佛祈禱。至十一時，監刑官命押赴刑塲，殷逆又戀戀然求向觀刑者談話，以演說姿態，大講其漢奸哲學，謂：渠雖受國法制裁，然仍係爲國犧牲，外人不明，詬稱叛國實則不然云云。當爲監刑官制止，於轉身走向預置之坐櫈之際，一槍自後腦進左眼出，殷逆一躍而仆，並轉瑞向上，猶未氣絕，越四分鐘，行刑者再補一槍，始告畢命，時爲十一時十二分。此內亂外患罪行集於一身之老奸醜史乃告終止。</p>

<p>孫科訓詞　孫副主席繼致訓，略稱：鐵聯係根據今年五月新頒布之工會法所組成，工會法之宗旨，爲增進員工知識，改良技術，促進勞資協調，謀取員工福利，及提高工作效能，盼全體鐵路員工，配合國家動員政策，勞力維護交通，並謀取本身之進步，以促進社會之進步，使國家步入工業化之途徑。我國過去缺乏工會組織，尤無全國性之組織，今日全國性之鐵聯成立，實具有重大意義，亦爲新工會法之初步成功。國父建國方略中之六大計劃，其中四項爲交通，以鐵路爲主要目標，鐵路所負使命之重大，於此可見，盼能達成任務。</p>
<p>陳立夫詞　陳部長立夫至詞中，強調組織與團結之重要謂：組織本身之價值，即在於通過組織，健全每一份子，使在同一目標下，發生巨大力量。工人爲革命與建設之中心，歷史在在證明，希望鐵聯員工能力求本身之團結，在現階段中，通過鐵聯之機構，負起肅清反革命者之任務。</p>
<p>谷正綱詞　谷部長正綱勉勵員工努力參加戡亂工作，切實組織鐵路兩旁民衆，　清奸匪，保持一貫精神，盡力搶　被破壞之鐵路並勉鐵聯加強領導，參加實施憲政與路政之建設，培養新幹部，尤宜於工會組織中注重提高工作效能，使工會組織日益健全。</p>
<p>俞大維司　俞部長大維稱：今日之鐵路，遭遇若干困難，鐵路之必需器材，如鋼軌，枕木，通訊器材，均感缺乏，鐵路日遭破壞，人手不敷，整個鐵路開支亦相差甚巨，目前惟賴全體員工之勞力，始能挽回當前危機。去年一年中，各地員工均曾有良好之工作表現，願能保持此種精神，以個人之犧牲貢獻，爲四萬萬同胞謀福利。</p>
<p>馬趙俊詞　馬部長超俊敘述鐵路員工三址年來之奮鬥史，並稱：三址年之奮鬥，吾人已獲得憲法之保障，參政之自由，此種事實，當令共匪之誣賴宣傳，不攻自破，希望員工今後力求健全組織機構，培養服務觀念，使鐵聯工會在主管與工人之間，成爲眞正橋梁，負起排難解紛之責任，工人爲建國基礎，尤盼工人愛護自己，也能愛護他人，不辱本身地位　使命。</p>
<p>開幕禮於十二時禮成。今日參加曲禮之工會代表，共出席六十餘人，代表全國三十萬鐵路員工，全國鐵路工會之聯合會，於現今戡亂繫中。正式成立，在我國鐵路史上實屬創舉。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約三十一日電〕聯合國大會昨夜表決之分治計劃，將巴勒斯坦分爲三區，一部份劃。爲猶太國，一部份劃爲阿拉伯國，靠近中央之一小部份，包括耶路撒冷及伯利恒在內，劃爲國際區。在地岡上，巴勒斯坦形如鐮刀，刀尖向柬，其南部佔地約及全境三分之一，與埃及接壤，猶太人將獲得其內地之大部份土地，阿拉伯人則在海岸一帶獲得一條狹長土地。巴勒斯坦中部　臨死海與約但河，西瀕地中海，猶太人可獲其沿海狹長地帶，台拉維夫城與海法港亦在其丙。阿拉伯人則將獲得其他部份及耶法港。北部方面猶太人在東面獲得狹畏之一片土地，沿底培利亞斯海面至黎巴嫩邊界，即新約上所謂之加利。阿刺伯人獲得北端士地，耶穌降生地拿撒勒即在其內。</p>
<h3>阿人羣情激昂　中東局勢緊張　總罷工三日抗議分治</h3>
<p>〔聯合社開羅一日電〕阿刺伯高級執行委員會今日籲請聖地阿刺伯人自明日起實行總罷工三天，藉對聯合國大會決議巴勒斯坦分治一節表示抗議。該會並要求阿刺伯人加緊抵制猶太貨，凡與猶太人通商者槪以叛進論罪。同時巾東方面暴動程度益形激烈，大馬色叔利亞人民遊行示威，縱火焚燒美公使館。巴勒斯坦亦發生衝突，猶太人頗有死傷。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕聯大通過巴勒斯坦分治之消息傳至中東後，整個中東即進入緊張狀態之中巴勒斯坦傳已有猶太人十名被殺。在開羅之阿拉伯聯盟秘書長阿柴姆聲言，分治決議將燃起近東之火。黎巴嫩總理索爾在報達　表談話，謂阿拉伯聯盟已成立秘密決機，叔利亞黎巴嫩之陸軍業已待命出動。伊拉克總理賈布爾在報達記者招待會中聲言阿拉伯人之職責，在拯救巴勒斯坦。阿拉伯國保衛巴勒斯坦之執委會於召開秘密會議四小時後，表示目前已爲行動之期而非談話之時。在巴勒斯坦方面耶城英軍奉令留營，不得外出以防事端。台拉維夫猶人則狂權慶祝。猶太地下組織伊爾根團自其台拉維夫總部之秘密電台中發言，聲言在猶太國內，伊爾根將停止存在，但同時又曰「分治乃屬不法，猶太公會代表之簽字，不能使猶太人民受其束縛，解放整個巴勒斯坦之戰將繼續進行。」伊拉克內閣今日開會三小時，殆係討論即時執行一九四六年阿聯既在勃　丹決定之決議，據云其中包括阿拉伯人大批移入巴勒斯坦之計劃等。同時據悉，黎巴嫩總理等在報達與伊拉克領袖竟日晤談，而報達與開羅問之電話綫亦頓呈忙碌。埃及學生有罷課等示威，亞歷山大法魯克大學學生之千餘名並電阿拉伯高級執委會，表示願爲巴勒斯坦流血。</p>

<h3>義大利局勢不穩　總理請美軍暫時留駐　共黨二萬名舉行武裝示威</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬一日電〕政府方面一日透露：由於義大利國內局勢之不穩，美國已決定將駐軍留至對義和約所允許之最穢一小時，此訊與美地中海艦隊之抵達那不勒斯相胎合。一般觀察家相信，由於共黨行動嚴重之威脅，加斯貝利總理曾請求美軍駐留至十二月十四日即條約中所規定之最後期限。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬三十日電〕義共黨領袖陶格里亞蒂在黨報發表一文警吿政府，謂禁止共黨之種種企圖，可能引起內戰。同時，義共黨員二萬人今日在熱諾亞舉行軍事檢閱，此更加重陶氏警吿之意義。此次主持檢閱者爲共黨副領袖朗戈，義大利北部賴格洪與安　那等地之共黨控制下之勞工組織，於是但罷工，支持熱諾亞之武裝示威。在羅馬若干區域內之非共黨報館與工廠等，均遭暴徒刧奪毀壊。政治觀察家認爲共黨員之軍事示威，可能立即加速共黨左各地之破壞行動。</p>

<h3>外長會議進入第二週　美擬就對德方案　對奧條約最後障礙未除</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫數一日廣播：外長會議今日進入第二週，在會議開始前，法外長皮杜爾吿新聞記者稱，荀外長會議對德國之将來不能獲致協議，則德境法佔區可能與英美佔區合併，成立一西部聯合德國。此外，另據權咸方面消息，蘇聯已拒絕法國所提處置奧境德資產之辦法，按後者係完成對奧條約之最後障礙。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三十日電〕四外長會議今日進入業二週，法國代表團籲請英美加緊控制魯爾區域，俾在外交上抵消蘇聯在德國東部之地位。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦三十日合衆電〕馬卿擬於最近數日內，在四外長會議中發表對德問題之最軍團聲明，其巾將包括對德經濟統一，建立全國臨時玫府之意見。僉信馬卿聲明乃重申其在莫斯利四外長會議巾所會略述之美國外交政策。渠將呼籲消除使各佔領區分離之障礙，　德國及早獲致經濟之統一，然後再組織德國中央政府。據悉，馬歇爾聲明所以延遲發表之原因，係由於美代表團關於魯爾工業區意見分成兩派之故。一係杜勒斯派主張魯爾由國際共管，另一爲克萊派則認爲應允德人在盟方監視下參加魯爾管制，如此可以保持全德國防止　武主義之復活。據未證實之消息，馬歇爾似贊成社氐之意見，果爾則美國全部外交政策，俱將改變</p>
<h3>籲請四強外長避免分裂德國　國際社會黨決議草案</h3>

<h3>援助法義奧貸欵案　美參院可獲通過　衆院可能將援華案列入</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕美參院定於一日表示五億九千七百萬美元之援助法。義。奧案，共和黨領袖，除開對馬歇爾長期計劃開火外，現各項徵象，皆表示渠等將令此案通過。參院委員會中之多數議員，現正努力　援助三國基金中，企圖削去之一億零八百萬美元，使之恢復。據此間消息靈通人士之意見，雖則衆院外委員會所建議六千萬是否有改變，尙不可知，然衆院可能通過，將援華列入臨時援助案內。</p>
<p>衆院案原文，如照現起草者。最後加以通過後，則參衆兩院，必須召開聯席會議，以便解決其意見分歧之點，惟此案參院加以修改通過，極有可能，因衆議員孟德最近稱：衆院外委員會在該案中，所以插人援華案，係便於馬歇爾需在認爲有此需要時，可以動用基金用於中國，惟孟德稱：國務部如決定此項基金不能予中國，則自可自由用於歐洲。雖則兩院對緊急援助案，在本星期內似能採取最後行動，然大多數人所關切者仍爲馬歇爾長期計劃</p>

<h3>本屆聯大會工作總檢討　一般認美蘇裂痕擴大</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約弗魯辛三十日電〕許多聯大代表相信甫經結束之木屆聯合國大會，雖不失爲聯合國史上最有成就之一屆，然新的糾紛區域，却亦爲之建立。木屆聯大之主要成就，有　設立巴爾幹委員會，以　察希臘疆界；　設立朝鮮委員會，以監督朝鮮民主議會之　舉，　設立「小型六，會」，設討論可能妨礙世界和平之問題；　設立巴勒斯坦委員會，以監督猶太及阿拉伯獨立國之成立　　聯及東歐集團國家　日宣布　制小型大會，巴爾幹委員會　　朝　委員會，故本屆聯大最大的積極成就，僅為決定巴勒斯坦之分治。然若干代表則認該案表決之際，不無專前　商之嫌，對於聯合國機構之設　，並不能增加信任。今蘇聯已宣布衹制小型大　等若干機將，阿拉伯國則宣布參制巴勒斯坦委會，故聯合國高級官員成認本屆　大匪特未曾使美國蘇接近，反使裂痕廣大</p>
<h3>法工潮更形擴大　巴黎水電煤氣供應中斷　議會延期討論緊急方案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：巴黎訊，由共產黨控制之勞工聯合會今日發表公報，聲明如許曼之緊急權力法案在議會中成爲法律，則聯合會將永不與政府進行談判，以解決法國之工潮。但在該項公報上簽字者，僅以共產黨員爲限，其他份子並未簽字，由此可知勞工界木身亦已分裂。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎一日電〕法國民議會一日集議討論許曼總理緊急措置方案之剩餘部份時，巴黎水電煤氣供應又因新罷工而受阻，地下交通亦有停頓之虞。許曼所提之法案，幾全部爲防止共黨之控制工會以及利用罷工爲政治武器，其中規定阻擾工人上工者將處以六個月至五年之徒刑與巨大之罰款。怠工武裝破壊與襲擊非罷工工人之處罰均加重一倍，共黨報紙亦將受實際上之控制。</p>
<p>共黨管制下之勞工總協會決策局亦定於今日集會，最後決定是否向許曼屈服而命令二百萬罷工者復工，共黨勞工陣錢中似已見若干分裂，然認爲此將引起對共黨領導之背叛尙言之過早。巴黎地下交通工人在一日中午完全停止工作，公共汽車雖照常行駛，然不能應付地下鐵道每日經常四百萬之客人。常氣工人雖罷工，然巴黎電流百分之八十五由省區之電力站供給者，故巴黎不致成爲完全黑暗之城，然工業用電必致銳减也。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎卅日電〕國民議會已延期討論政府之取締罷工法。勞工部長馬以爾則已與全國總工會代表議判解決工潮之辦法，同時政府常局則已調集更多之軍警以齊戒備。國民議會在決定延期辯論前，以三九七對一入四票，否決共產黨所提以拖延取締罷工法通過之若干修正案。然後，又以四〇四對一八四票通過該法案第一條動員八萬後備兵以補充安全軍力之規定。法共領袖陶　士，已於昨日自莫斯科返抵巴黎，當進入國民議會時，共黨議員均向其歡呼。</p>

<h3>東歐聯邦計劃　遲早有實現可能　九國共產情報局將開會</h3>
<p>〔路透社索菲亞三十日電〕保京晚報載稱，保總理狄米特洛夫最近在蘇聯喬治亞之蘇溪。晤史達林元帥時，曾談及組織東歐共產國家聯邦之計劃。</p>
<p>〔路透社員爾格勒三十日電〕此間負責人士對於倫敦星期日報紙所傳史達林與保總理狄米特洛夫最近晤談時談及組織東歐聯邦之說，表示並無所知，某一南斯拉夫官員竟作爲無　之談。然此問任何人士均未否認遲早組織東歐聯邦之可能性，惟有資望之人士則不信此一聯邦得在最近期內實現。猶憶南總理狄托元帥上過訪問保國時，曾述及南保合組聊邦之事，惟日，目前尙不擬組織此種蘇邦，但又日渠與狄米特洛去樂行之談話，已佈下組成聯邦之基礎。</p>
<p>〔路透社員爾格勒三日電〕消息靈通方面聲稱，九國共產黨情報局第一次會議之代表，將於日內齊集貝爾格勒，惟開會確期則尙無從探悉。據悉義共將派阿格里亞蒂及朗戈等兩巨頭參加，法共代表將爲法共代理秘書長杜格洛及共黨議員法雄。</p>

<h3>日片山首相被控　支持法西斯</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京一日電〕片山首相繼平野前晨相西尾長官之後，亦被有一南川忠常者向東京地方檢察廳控吿，其理由爲片山曾於一九三七年三月號之中央公論上，發表解釋國家總動員法案之論文，而未在提交中央公職適否審查委員會之調查表上將其記入。論文內容爲完全支持國家總動員法之法西斯語調。按南川爲海置特攻隊生還之一靑年，頃檢察當局以總理大臣被吿，尙屬創樂，故採取極愼重之態度處理比案。</p>

<h3>選舉監委開始提名　未奉展期命令前仍按日程辦理　大會推定投票開票監察員</h3>
<p>〔本報訉〕上海市參議會監察院蓋察委員選舉大會，於昨日上午十時在市參議會大禮堂舉行隆重之開幕典禮。到吳市長，潘議長，徐副議長，國民黨市黨部方主委，民政，財政等各局長及市參議員共百餘人。行禮知儀後，首由選舉監督吳市長入席，旋由主席潘議長致詞略稱：中華民國憲法不久即將實施，按憲法規定監察委員應由省市參議會選舉。本市定為二名，依程序規定於十二月七日投票。緣篮察權在憲法上是一個很重要的部門，欲使監察權行使恰當，幫助行政效率提高，則監察委員之人選亦必須適當。在選舉監察委員前，中央將此重任付托與各省市民意機關，可見國民代表大會制定憲法時，對民意機關是何等的重視。</p>
<h3>鄭重考慮　確當人選</h3>
<p>潘氏影響喻謂立法委員乃以省市人口比例產生，此猶似國圆之下議院議員形式，而監察委員則以行政區城規定，每省產生五名，每市二名，但不開人口多少，此則似上議院議员之設立。總之，選舉監察委員乃一非常鄭重之事，故盼各位參議員亦能鄭重　慮各人心目中可能代表上海市民到中央去行使監察權之人選。</p>
<h3>選舉監督解釋法令</h3>
<p>選舉監督吳市長繼講解有關本市之選舉法令及手續，略稱：　凡本市居民依法有選舉權年滿三十五歲，得被選為監察委員。候選人之提出，應經選舉人五人以上之運署，　凡在本籍外之選舉區所屬縣市或同等區埠居住六個月以上或有住所違一年以上者，其本籍雖未變更，而在該選舉區內亦得被選為監察委員。　現任官吏之参加競選者，無須事先辭職。　選舉方式乃就候選人名單中以無記名單記法圈選一人·每一參議員僅可提名一次。　每省市參議會議員當選為監察委員者，以一名為限。　監察委員於當選後由選舉監督分别通知，於按到通知十日內以甚面表示願否應選，其逾期不為示者視為願意應選，如不願應選以得票次多數者當選。</p>
<h3>投票開票。七日完畢</h3>
<p>議長並報吿一日至四日每日上午九時至下午五時，為各參議員完成候選人提名程序。四日下午六時由選舉監督在市政府及市參議會同時公布候選人名單。七日上午九時至下午五時為投票，授票係絕對秘密。七日下午六至九時則舉行開票，投票及開票時，均各有監察員四名在旁監察各參議员領票及投票開票等手續。其人選出大會推請議長指定為：投票監察員童行白·王先靑·姜懷素·汪竹一四人，開票監察員徐永祚，瞿鉞，勞敬修，水祥雲四人，如此八人中有彼提名為候選人者，則另以他人代之。</p>
<h3>虎楊與川百陶　多最望希選當</h3>
<p>最後由吳市長補充報吿謂本市辦理選舉監察委員，至今尙未接獲中央命令展期，故仍依法開會。如中央命令展期，則一日至四日之提名日期仍不更改，即提名仍以四日為截止日期，七日之投票日期則將展期。〔又訊〕據記者近日自各參議員分別探詢結果：此次鹽察委員人選，大多參議員均擬推選陶百川，尙有一部份則擬摧選參議會外之楊虎云。</p>

<h3>牙刷業職工罷工</h3>
<p>〔本報訉〕牙刷業一部份廠家職工約一百餘人，於昨日罷工。據悉，其原因為抗議責方不遵守罐錄。社會局聞訊後派員調解，並由徐孟標兜攬定購，價格為每令二十萬四千元，先收貨款半數，　起交貨，原吿以其中央書店印書需紙正股，乃於八月二十日及二十五日兩次向其訂購紙張三千令，先後交付貨款半數計三億大百萬元，上項貨款均由平親送該公司，交朱親收，由祈簽立契約，出給收據為憑，詎到期無貨可交，迭經催緊無效，事後調查，始知該公司向蘇商務參贊所定之報紙，早於兜售前因未付定洋，巳取消契約，即輸管會亦始終未曾發給任何進口證，其所收各客戶半數貨款，全係以欺罔方法用失效定單反較低價絡為餌，使人誤信不疑，應依法共　刑事責任，且第一次定貨到期後，被吿等知無法交貨，依約結價一部，計三億五千九百六十六萬，當出給　興誠銀行九月廿三日支票二紙，乃到期往兌，亦因透支　額而遭退票，經屢次交涉，僅償還一部。計一億元，餘款及未結費價均置之不理，爱具狀請求依法懲辦，並令賠償損失廿六億九千六百萬元云。</p>

<h3>一紙名單引起反感　港滬新空綫開航招待港報界試飛</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕據香港新聞界來人談：香港英商組織之香港航空公司港滬綫，定二百正式通航。該公司準備邀請香港中西記者隨機試航，並觀光京滬各地。披邀請報社之名單，本包括國民日報，工商日報及中央通訊社港分社在內，詎談公司於十一月二十六日發出請柬時，祇有英文「南華早報」，「德臣西報」，及中文「華僑日報」，「星島日報」等四家，以此引起全港中國新聞界之不滿。因其所邀請之「華僑日報」，抗戰期間，曾公然附逆，其主持人岑維休，被我政府明令通緝在案，而該報近復袒護共匪，詆毀我政府，故該報現尙為我政府禁止入境才非法報紙，廣州行轅通令在案。今該公司竟正式邀請該非法報紙之代表，昂然入我國境，不獨對全港中國新聞界為一種侮辱，且亦對我國政府明令之一種諷刺。故香港新聞界擬聯銜通電　滬同業，一致予以抨擊，並請拒絕招待該項所謂「香港記者團」，以維民族正氣。該公司更令香港新聞界不满者，則共臨時取銷邀請之國民日報，工商日報及中央社分社，或為與我政府有密切關係之言論機關，或為擁護政府國策之報紙。該香港航空公司此舉，充分表現其對我國不友誼之態度，故香港新聞界羣起抨擊，繼請　滬同裝，對該項不能代表港埠中國新聞界之記者團，不予招待。</p>

<h3>對煤斤管制問題　燃管會發表聲明　損益均歸國庫並無利潤</h3>

<p>「張飛上推諸葛亮」　「英雄」橋上去來忙</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕活躍在蘇州河兩岸橋頭的「推車英雄」，事上海特有的社會現像之一，他們是在艱困的社會生存條件下，以流氓勢力為掩護的三百六十行以外的一行。</p>
<p>上海的市民大都有過與「推車英雄」按觸的經驗，不少人更深惡痛絕於他們的惡劣作風。這些「英雄」們往往不管坐車人的是否同意，而以「强制執行」的手段來帮助車夫把車推到橋頂，有　狡黠的則僅僅是抓住了車槓裝装樣子，實際上他們究竟出過多少力眞是天曉得！車子到得橋頂時他們就向乘客索取酬報，目前的時價為國幣一千元·大多數乘客都在一種厭惡與怕麻烦的情緒下取出鈔票來，也許認為這與打發一個乞丐差不了多少。如果碰巧身邊沒有零票，或者有些個性强烈的乘客，偏偏不願付給，這時候「英雄」們就會以許多惡毒的字眼來辱駡，玻則抓住車子向下坡路使勁一推。這樣，即使車子還不致於傾覆，乘客可要做嚇得一大跳了。</p>
<h3>爺教班子佔據地盤</h3>
<p>這「推車英雄」的幕後，都有其系統與地盤，每一座橋榤都有一個或兩個「爺叔班子」的老資格流氓坐鎭，推車的我們稱之為「英雄」，實際上都是「爺叔」門下的「小鬼」　了。「爺叔」佔據了橋樑的地盤，收機一班「小鬼」來做摧車的工作，每天收取他們一定數日「孝敬」，一個「爺叔」手下如果攤有二十個「小鬼」，以現在的市而估計，他每天坐享其成的收入約在卅萬元左右。因為利益如此優原。所以他們間的界限壁壘非常查嚴，所謂「河水不犯井水」，在甲橋的不能到乙橋去推，在橋這一端的也不能到橋那一端去推，稱外人則尤其节要想插足，如果有不懂上海世故的落魄者，也想來摧一下　　大餅錢，他們就會羣趄而攻之。這樣，大餅尙未有着落，一頓　打倒是够受的了。</p>
<p>質的方面漸有變化</p>
<p>他們帮中人稱這一行業有句「切口」，呌做「張飛上推藷葛亮」。他們把車上的乘客　諸坐孔明車的諸葛亮，較之乞丐盜匪得了钱财還把「顧客」作為「猪　」看待的作風，似乎好得多了，至於他們之以張飛自况，也許是受了三國演義中長阪坡張飛嚇退曹兵故事的影響。</p>
<p>最近、「橋頭英雄」在質的方面起了些變化。有許多戰區逃亡到上海的難民加入了這一陣營。記者昨天到橋頭觀察，發現有幾個推車的絲毫沒有流氓的氣息，一眼望去就可以看出他們乃是離開泥土没有多久奴　質的晨民。我試着　仕一個二十歲左右的靑年，他居然站定了恭恭敬敬的聽我問話。</p>
<p>每天可得四五萬元</p>
<p>他吿訴我說是從安　逃出來的難民，到上海後起先在市區內求乞、後來碰到了「老　」，（他這樣稱他的流氓「爺叔班子」），問他願不願意到橋上推車？他想：這可不是此「要飯」好一些嗎！這樣就開始了橋頭生涯。現在每天大約可以推到四五萬元，其中須「孝敬」老　一萬五千元。他一家四口，父親也在另一座橋上推車。</p>
<p>這是一個典型的中國大地上受難的農民。他誠誠懇懇陪我談話，費去了大約推一次車的時間，而從口袋裏摸出兩千元鈔票給他，他為這微薄的賜予再三道謝，然後微笑着奔去。</p>
<p>對於這些披戰事摧毁了才淪落到橋頭來的推車者，我想我們是不應該像對待其他的「推車英雄們」一般痛惡他們的！但是為币容和变通安全方面着想，我們仍希望市政當局能予取締如果不是正當局默認為正職業之一而故意縱容這一批「英雄」活躍在座橋樑上的話，似乎及早收容到難民收容所或敎養機關去，不是此較更妥善嗎</p>
<p>壁壘非常森嚴帮外休想插足　戰區逃亡難民頗多加入陣營</p>

<p>足球裁判會為該會會員於上週出塲執行職務時，無故突遭兇毆，為商討對策計，定今日下午六時，在復興中路東華體育會會所，召開臨時緊急全體會員會議，屆時該會全體會員，均將出席。</p>
<h3>兩淮秋運會盛況　淮海男女靑年興奮熱烈</h3>
<p>〔本報淮陰訊〕蘇北的體壇，向是落後的，何况中問更經過了十年的　亂。我們站在這個觀點上來看這次哄動了淮海間的兩淮秋運大會，當此　　未淸，烽煙遍地的今日的蘇北，僮覺得意味深長。</p>
<p>遠在今年夏間，淮海　靖區司令部辦理「靑年夏令營」之際，張雪中司令官就開始有了舉行一個運動會的動機。經過數月的籌備，這個富有意義的節目，在總理誕辰的那一天，在明朗的日光照糧下，更在千萬個淮海靑年的歡呼中揭幕了。</p>
<p>首先，我們應當了解，在種種條件的限制下，我們對於各項成績，是不必寄予太高的希望的。然而我們所應當注意的，是各個選手的與奮的情緒，有很多縣份的選乎，都是不　安通的困難和危險，趕來參加的。</p>
<p>在大會中，我們可以發現許優秀的選手，從他們的身上，我們可以設明蘇北的體育界，還是有它的前途的。淮陰縣中有一位十五歲的學生，他是中法的混血兒，他參加撑竿跳高，雖因體力不够而屈居第二，然而他的姿態，他的動作的正確和輕鬆。却是其他任何一位選手所不及的。此外省立淮安中學的趙驪和准陰承志巾學的崔揚兩位小姐，在跳高，跳遠。壘球。鐵餅……各項田徑賽中，都包辦了女生組大部份的錦標，而為全塲所　目的人物。</p>
<p>大會四天來，在千萬雙眼　的注視中，於十四日閉幕，四天來靑年們的歡呼，靑年們的跳躍，已經把淮海間千萬個健兒的心凝結在一赶了。</p>

<h3>經濟戡亂辦法即將實施　本巿物價普遍回跌　傳將指派幹員設置管制機構</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來頻傳中　當局有在年內實施經濟戡亂急要措施，並將在本巿設置管制金融物資機構，俾物價能獲長期之規定。風聞所至，昨晨本市一般物價，普遍展開跌風，結果約較上週末軋跌一成光景，下午因銀根　鬆，始略見回好。</p>
<p>以華股言，上午各股一度跌停板，永紗曾跌至三二二元，下午回好至三六二元廿一支變馬自三一三〇萬元跌至二七五〇萬元，下午回好百餘萬元。四十二支藍　自五〇五〇萬元跌至四六〇〇元，下午約好起二百餘萬元。各檔棉花，約軋跌一成。白粳軋小三萬元。麵粉下跌一萬至一萬五千元。生油豆油亦小廿萬至卅萬元。他如捲菸皂皂燭，亦均普過下降一成。</p>
<p>一般觀測，如當局能頒行經濟戡亂急要揹施，並設置管制機構，指派幹員，事責澈底執行，再配合國家行局放款及收縮銀根政策，則年內物價，可望不再發生波動云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕自政府在滬執行經濟戡亂急要措施方案井另設經濟戡亂機構消息揭佈後，昨日（一日）一股物價均呈全面下跌現象。中央社記者會走訪國行負責人探詢究竟，據稱：本行對以上方案，目前尙未接率任何命令。至另設機構一點，亦尙不得而知，張總裁現仍因公　京，今晚井無離京消息，一俟張氏返滬後，內容如何，即可分曉。該負責人織分析過去物價漲風及現在下跌之內在因素稱，最近物價波動，主要原因　爲金鈔紗布上漲之領導所致。此次下降，亦爲該項物品首當其衝，急切下挫所造成。據調查一日市價金鈔約下降百分之十，比之最高峯下降約百分之三十；紗布以紡調會宣布決於最短期間實施聯配制度，再以該會適應急要措施，委託紡建公司向市塲儘量拋售，市價亦下跌百分之十以上，比之最高峯跌去百分之二十。再按過去金鈔買賣，實際交易寥落，供求不均，造成畸形心理作用。此次下跌，乃心理循環之自然趨勢，上海本爲投機市塲，人心浮動，觀此可作投機者之當頭一棒。此外如國家行局及省市銀行停止放款，再如各地匯款限制來滬諸點，均爲收緊銀根之有效措施。且國行對檢查行莊，仍繼讀進行，關於票據當日不能抵用一節，在新辦法未曾頒佈以前，國行決遵照財政部前令，嚴格執行，當日絕對不能抵用。抽緊銀根，對抑平物價，旣已著效果，國行二日仍當繼續進行。該負責人對物價前途之穩定狀態，表絕對樂觀。渠繼稱：今後自備外匯到埠物資之處理，中美救濟物資之陸續運到，以及美貸將獲成功，政府掌握大批物資，種種因素，對物價前途，均有裨益，投機陰霾，更不難廓淸云。</p>
<h3>人心極度惶恐華股跌勢劇烈</h3>
<p>股昨變幻頗巨，初以人心極度不安，中途慘跌，永紗美亞信和跌達限度，有力集團在塲外乘低力補，國行又復差出，低後急切回昇。</p>
<p>初以經濟緊急戡亂方案之公布，及蔣經國氏有來滬主特訊，遭受當頭打聲，永紗開低至三六五元及三七〇元。一七九號乖均出遞交，三二號先慫後出，一六號等　即交，自三六五元及三七二元起，逐步下降。中泥由一七九號等掛跌停板，而退至二四七元及二五一元。場外息價開低至二角二分半及二角七，而後略盤。六七號等進即交，九一號等趁低吸納遞交，曾回升至三五〇元及三五七元。二二〇號等連袂拋售遞交，六七號等斬售即交不已，金融帮拆放不易，羣情惶恐，美亞由二一九號等分別將現　掛停板，永紗亦於十一時半，現遞同吿跌至限度，五四號等趁低維持，一一七號等進即交，會於臨收前回升至三三〇元及三三八元。九八號力售即交，一七三號等出遞交，午收仍退爲三二八元及三三三元。現遞信和亦跌停後稍回，結果較上週六計即交股永紗美亞信和跌停後徵回，與華新中紡榮豐統益中絲火柴五和永公內衣新華各跌一成左右，中泥跌停，景福中法華電新光各跌成半，閘北景繪大通跌半成。遞交股計永紗美亞信和跌停後有回，與華豐勤興同跌一成內外。新光景福跌成半。</p>
<p>後市上塲仍疲，遞美亞由二七號掛停，二二三號等賣遞交，二二六號等出即交，永紗亦吿跌至限度，現遞相差過度，套利者衆，遞交且有低於限度三三二元成交者。一五五號等紛補即交，六五號等進遞交。初傳國行交換僅差進一百餘億而升至三四四元及三五三元，八四號等出即交，一六〇號等賣遞交，降至三四〇元及三五五元，國行交換出一七〇億，四號等進胃又健，乃吿反動。塲外有京帮力購七億股之訊，人心大好，而漲到三五八元及三六五元高價。三二號等逢高尙售，收市爲三五六元及三六〇元。結果較晨收即交股計新光景福勤興漲一成，華新永紗榮豐信和統益中絲華豐中法升半成，餘均微升。遞交股華豐微升，永紗信和美亞勤興升半成强，新光景福漲一成弱，塲外各老股均吿回跌。</p>
<p>麗安百貨增資業已完成，新股定十二月四日週四前市起登塲，成交單位暫定爲十萬股。</p>
<h3>食米賡續下游　雜糧油巿再小</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩巿共到米糧三萬一千石左右，市况因各物俱下，到源湧旺，消化不振，賡讀下游。粳米續挫一二萬元，秈米再低萬餘元，白元中次亦跌一二萬元。麵粉變氣籠罩之下，繼續步跌萬餘元，麩皮亦少受主，再削萬餘元。豆餅客帮微動，貨主急脫，狂跌二萬元。內地出售路貨，猛挫三萬元。黃豆去化淸閒，續跌二三萬元，油廠不動。茶豆竟少問津，赤豆無人顧問，豇豆乏交，蠶豆零化亦懈，轉跌一二萬元。苞米北洋停辦，慘跌八九萬元。紅糧再低一二萬元，生仁廣　已淡，暴跌六七萬元。</p>
<p>油市急轉直下，一片賣出聲中，生油猛烈下降二十餘萬元，豆油劇跌二十萬元，菜蔴油相繼狂落十七八萬元。</p>
<h3>統債外股俱挫</h3>
<p>公債昨亦迫低，成交不過四百萬，統丙最開二三二〇〇元，低至二二二〇〇元，而後稍平。結果較上週六計甲乙跌一千元，丙種降一千七，丁種低八百三，統戊亦小一千二。</p>
<p>外股昨處各業疲境，亦吿回瀉，散戶稍買，銀行帮證券帮洋行帮俱供。怡紗最開三三〇〇〇〇元，曾低至二九八○〇〇元，後市又回漲至三二五〇〇〇元左右掙扎，港申電報長至三元九，結果較上週六計英聯會德機業廣怡啤航業鋼業各跌一成，祥泰慘降成半，怡紗紙版電話電車各跌半成。</p>
<p>呢羢穩定</p>
<p>毛織品呢羢，昨日頗形暢銷，花呢嗶發直貢，華達呢宣維，大衣呢平厚呢，麥而登制服呢等，零囊交易均極繁盛。湖北路林森路南京路男女服裝商店，現定衣生生意均好，協大正餘與棋　街帮，進出亦忙。長樂茶會上買多於賣，行情明雖尙穩穩定，暗中咸現俏漲</p>
<h3>國行嚴格限制票據當日抵用</h3>
<p>據悉：限制票據當日抵用，在新辦法未會頒佈之前。國行為澈底執行經濟　亂急要措施，決　照財部前令，嚴格執行，以消　興風作浪之投機商人，而安定金融，改善民生。</p>
<h3>美金庫劵配售額以上月餘額為準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三十六年美金短期庫劵，第二期自十月一日開始發售，截至十一月底止，全國共售出二，一一五，〇五〇美元，內三八〇美元。十二月分配售數額已由財政部規定，暫以十一月份配數尙未售　之餘額為準，以後再視募銷情形酌量調整。</p>
<h3>多頭傾吐交易淸稀　紗布一片喊賣聲　現棉價瀉有供無求</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因銀根　緊，更逢紡建開售，交易平常，多頭斬結甚夥，塲內一片喊賣聲，行情步步下瀉。迨至最後，四十二支藍風細紗跌進五千萬關，盤低至四千六百萬元，比週末收價每包疾瀉四百五十萬元。其餘粗細紗亦劇降二三百萬。</p>
<p>昨日棉布币况，以塲內種種不利買方之消息，大戶傾吐，市勢直綫下瀉。結果十二磅龍頭等各檔細布比上週六收價，一致劇跌十一二萬之多。嗶嘰斜紋府綢元直貢及元質緞均挫十萬左右，惟一九〇士林布及色布市氣尙堅。</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况因紗布疲軟，人心極虛，更以銀根緊急，有供無求，市價猛瀉，交易僵持，做開甚少，成交一五〇包。</p>
<p>管制紗布意見一斑</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨以當局有全面管制花紗布之傳聞，微詢六區棉紡公會理事長王啓宇氏意見。渠稱：如政府能顧到紗廠再生產成本，解決原料資金問題，勿使紗廠停工减工，則在當前國家多難之情形下，紗廠當應推誠合作。惟民營各紗廠業務方針，或各有不同，渠個人之意見，當未能代表全體民營紗廠之意見云。</p>
<h3>運輸困難成本增加　燃管會調整煤價　較十一月份約增四成弱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕燃管會負責人昨爲該會調整本月份配煤價格及配煤成本，發表談話如次：　按本會向各管制礦價購煤斤，其價格皆由經濟部核定，外加各項必要費用，配供各方需耍。其售價亦由部定，絕無利潤可言。</p>
<p>本會除管制開　華東淮南，及台灣各礦外，所有國內煤斤，概在准許廠商自行購運之列。而國內白煤，本會絕不管制，工商界儘可自由採遝。查國內煤斤之供不應求，最大原因，厥爲交通之不暢。關於此點，本會以數月來之努力，尙未能見有成效。例如焦作至新鄉段鐵路損毀，經與國防交通兩部再三磋商，搶修護路，至今仍無具體辦法。北寗路與津浦南段車輛不足，軍用頻繁，對於煤運之影響絕大。迄今開　礦區，已存煤達六十餘萬噸，淮南五六萬噸，華東三四萬噸，即令開放煤源，誠恐工業界亦無力運輸。故改良運輸，尤以鐵路運輸，實爲解決煤荒之關鍵云。</p>
<p>十二月份煤斤配售價目，經調整如次：甲。公用事業一五十萬元。乙，鐵路軍運海軍　浦一七三萬元。丙，外埠電廠輪船及本巿交通機構，分級計價，自一七三萬元起至二一二萬元止。丁，工廠及軍政機關分級計價，自二一七萬元起至二五九萬元止。戊，外國煤及白煤照十一月份配價，約增加四成弱。</p>
<h3>進口向輸管會申請收購及退貨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲探悉自十一月廿三日廿九日止進口商向向管會限額分配處聲請收購已核准者，計華學品一萬九千餘美元，橡膠一千餘美元，油脂臘一千餘美元，紙張木漿三萬八千餘美元，藥品八百美元，木材二萬三千餘美元共十二件，十一月十六日至廿二日聲請者則共爲十四萬八千餘一美元共十四件，至廿九日止向非限額分配處請求附表一項下之貨品許可證入口者共一百八十餘件，已准一百廿一件，迄廿九日止聲請收購附表三A項下貨品者計二件，至於要求退回原地重行出口者達五百十三件。</p>
<h3>銀根緊俏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀根，昨日上午奇緊，暗息一度痕遙二角五分關口，下午稍見回鬆，暗息亦回降至二角二分，華股貼息自二角三分至二角七分半。國家行局結果差出一七〇億元。預料今日銀根將見緊俏，因國家行局將有大批棉紗食糧結款。昨日銀錢業聯準庫抑出頭寸八九億之譜，銀錢同美中銀根尙　平穩。國家行局，中央差入四七四億元，中農出一七四億元，中信局出五七八億元，其他行局出入不大。此外大交換人八一九億元，外商入四三二億元，小交換出一〇八一億元。</p>
<h3>人造絲慘瀉</h3>
<p>比上週末低落約一千萬元人造絲昨市上午慘落，下午稍振，結果比上週末知去一千萬元之讀。一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤一億〇二百萬元，乏人過問，步步下降，最小到九千五百萬元，後首九千六百五十萬元，隔日期有成交。四A貨做九千一百萬元，下午人心稍好，升至九百萬元賣出價，最後一億〇一百萬元有成交。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>昨捲烟市面，最開成交頗多，以業外各物猛瀉而見挫。結果十支大英老刀兩烟較之上日續跌一百十五萬至九十萬元。</p>
<p>日用品市面，市勢下挫，固本剪刀二牌皂價繼降兩萬元，美麗鳳凰火柴軋小十餘萬元。火油洋燭仍堅穩。</p>
<p>昨木材市况，人心處軟，杉木由漲風中回下，洋松市價亦不支。</p>

<h3>發刊辭</h3>
<p>— 張其盷</p>
<p>學津周刊顧名思義，是學術津梁之意。本刊希望成爲一座溝通大學與社會的一座橋梁。本刊幾位編輯現在均在大學任敎，其學科包含人文學社會科學和自然科學諸方面。大致言之，人文學功用在於了解自己，社會科學在於了解他人，自然科學在於了解宇宙。合知己知人和知天三者，方能成爲心訓練。這原是現代大學敎育的通義，也可說是本刊的旨趣所在。</p>
<p>自由爲民治之基礎。人人有自由，非謂人人可自私自利。凡自由人應具有責任觀念，應該忠於眞理，忠於人羣，對於他人之觀點，應有虛懐審察的雅量。自由精神實際就是實事求是的科學精神，尙觀察，貴經驗，重事實，信證據，作系統少推理，爲客觀之論斷。此種心習的養成，實爲民治國家公民敎育的核心問題。「知寬容之要而不流於虛無，知信仰之要而不流於獨斷，知批評之要而不流於憤世嫉俗之犬儒主養」。自由社會所賴以成立者在此，今日我國建國的心理基礎，綜括要旨亦不外乎是。</p>
<p>今日是原子時代，日本廣島的火燄，永在人們心目中留下嚴肅的敎訓。現代各種問題均受科學與技術深遠的影響。科學之可貴在其方法，科學方法是克服成見消除誤會的工具。畏懼科學和崇拜科學，兩俱失之，目前所需要的是了解科學。我們應把科學知識上理論與實際，技術與觀念，融會貫通，並透過輿論，使一般公民都能了解，非如是不能使現代文化安全無恙。</p>
<p>但是，科學並不能代表全部學術，科學須與人文學相輔相成。人文學包括哲學史學文學藝術之類，其與科學之分野，在於科學只問原因，不問目的，只問部分，不問全體，人文學所以補科學之所未逮。科學的人文主義，在現代世界最爲需要。人文主義起原甚古，中國古代文化與希臘文化無不注重君子之風，視爲人文修養之準繩。惟現代人文主義者必須了解科學之方法與精神，與時偕進，故又稱科學的新人文主義。本刊茲以學津呼名，願爲科學人文化而努力。</p>
<h3>今古科學的分野</h3>
<p>— 陳立</p>
<p>從社會學的觀點看，科學是時代精神（Zeitgeist）的化身。科學旣不能超脫時代的背景，則現代科學與古代科學，便因爲時代的不同，不能不有一些觀點或旨趣的差別，更不必說及其成就的懸殊。本文在提綱挈領地提出這些差別中的重要幾點來。</p>
<p>第一，古代科學重視事物本體的究竟。中國的陰陽五行和古希臘的原子說，例如Smpectocles的水火土氣，都是用來說明萬物本體的究竟的。亞里士多得界說物理學爲「事物本性的研究」（Inquiry　into　the　nature　of）things），我們特別看重其中的本性一詞。本性顯然可以分析爲兩點：一爲本，即原始（Origin），一為性，即本（Essence）。希臘人正如秦漢諸子般，談自然便很容易牽涉到宇宙的起源。當我們讀到他們描寫太初混沌In　the　beginning　was　an　indefinite　incoherent　homogeneity諸如此類的一些話，我們自然拿聯想到我國諸子，例如淮南子的天文訓諸篇：</p>
<p>「天地未形，馮馮翼翼，洞洞　　，故曰太始。太始生虛　，虛　生宇宙，宇宙生元氣。元氣有涯垠，清陽者薄靡而爲天，重濁者凝滯而爲地。淸陽之合專易，重濁之凝竭難；故天先成而地後定。……」</p>
<p>我們或者因為這種演變的說法而對古代科學注重本質的意見感覺迷憫。本質的基本特徵為不變，那麼古代科學怎樣又會產生演化論？除非我們看淸這一點，我們難得知道古代科學與現代科學於演化見解的基本歧異。</p>
<p>即以上引的淮南子爲例。天地如何演化成？這由於氣有道有經，或有淸有濁。重濁下凝爲地，輕淸上浮爲天。演化的原因，在於事物的本質。不但演化的結果為事物的本質所決定，即變程的先後也如此。「淸陽之合專易，重濁之凝竭難；故天先成而地後定」。先後的次序，顯然也是物性決定的。因此，茍能了然物質的本性，天地間的現象便莫不易一按岡索驥」了。</p>
<p>旣然從事物的本性可以推論到一切現象的過程，所以演繹法在古代科學中便佔了極祟高的地位。柏拉岡將幾何推祟爲一切科學的皇后，便是因爲幾何是純粹演繹的。旣然「勢有必至，理有固然」則觀察不必要，至少是次要，實騐更不用談了。一切旣可推理得來，我們又何必斤斤乎眼前的根據？一耳目之知有限」，經騐便反變了「良知」的累贅。例如直綫，經騐中的直綫，旣不直又非錢，常成爲推論的障碳，幾何之被希臘人所推崇，另一原因，便是因爲他們以爲幾何的推論是不恃耳目之見的。這種不難觀察，不憑經騐，專恃良知，是古代科學與今日科學最不同的一點。因爲不必有經驗的根據，所以古代科學一開口便是「鴻濛初闢」時的狀態如何如何。現代人很好附會說這就是今日的演化論。其實，這與現代演化學說是風馬馬不相及的。何故？因爲這種演　完全是根據推理而來，而不是憑藉事實得來。紛紜萬象的世界，我們可以抽出若千相同的本質來，從道些本質，我們又可以抽出更原始的本質，所謂「推而別之，別則有別，至於無別，然後止」，（荀子正名篇）從殊相到共相，從共相推論到其背後的「無相」的原型（Formless,Prototype）或無極。這種從繁而簡的推論，可以原於純邏輯的推演，即內涵日縮，外延日廣，登峯造極，內涵逼近零，速form都沒有了，外延便無所不包。這產推論的結果，自然是越遠越簡單，形式上便和近代的演化論相似。但精神上，兩者完全背道而馳，決不可牽强附會爲一談的</p>
<p>近代科學的着眼點不是事物的本質，而是事物間的關係。這一點從伽里略的墜重實驗便可看個分明。亞里士多得的觀點是本質的，所以他說物有重輕，重的比輕的要下降得快些。但伽里略則認定下降速率的分別，與本質無關，不論輕重大小應該下降相同，所不同的，便是由於環境的關係。在現代科學敎育中，中學裏的物理實驗。用羽毛和一枚錢同在抽到眞空的玻璃管中墮下去，我們便看見它們雙雙同時降落。換言之，下降現象的遲速不同，不是由於本質有輕重，使「重者必速，輕者必遲」。而是由於環境的關係，由於空氣的阻力，羽毛與錢下降才呈不同的速度。</p>
<p>我們現在再掉轉頭來討論現代科學的演化論。達爾文的演化學說，不是以爲物種有不得不變的內在本質，而是由於適應環境的結果。所謂「物競天擇」，「物競」指生物與生物間的關係，「天擇」拽生物與自然環境的關係。總而言之，其重心是在關係上而不在本質上。這一重大觀點的轉變便在科學中掀起一個澈底的革命，即觀察與實驗代替形式的推理，由靜的邏輯而轉向於動的邏輯。</p>
<p>過去的科學旣着重在本質，所以分類學（Taxonomy）是學問的方法樞紐。因爲一個人如果知道某件東西屬於某一類或某一種族，我們便可以從其類別或種別的性質推諭其必有的屬性。祇要知道孔子是人的一類，就知道孔子必死，因為死是人的屬性。作者在上文雖然主張古科學是不靠觀察的，但古科學並不完全不用觀察。例如亞里士多得便做了一些觀察的工作。分類也常常需要觀察，但觀察祇到分類而止。其後的一切便在推演。所謂變化亦如此。古科學不是不講變化，但其所謂變化也祇是本質的開展（Unfolding），好像一軸畫的逐漸展開而達到一個完幅的境地般。例如小孩是人，有人的屬性，故必發展成人。他的發展便為本質所決定，我們祇要知道他是人而已。這一觀點，雖然並不排斥變的概念，但觀點是靜的。其將將的發展早已蘊藏在胚始的「幾」中。因此，古科學的演化論是保守的，先定的。</p>
<p>現代科學的演化論便完全不然。它不是趨向於預定的原型。事物間的相互關係決定它的命運途徑，因此，我們便不能專從本質來預測它的歸趣。我們得觀察，因為關係無窮，所以觀察無止境。例如二十六個字母（本質）儘管認識，但二十六個字母聯合變換（關係）便無止境，一個人決不能從二十六個字母而推論出二十六個字母拼出之字的意義。每一個拼法有一個新的意義，所以每一種關係都得去重新觀察。新科學的觀點是動的，變化無端的。正因其如此今科學便注重實騐。實騐的精髓就在改變條件（即環境與本質的相互關係）來觀察，即觀察其變，而不是觀察其常。實騐是觀察在某條件下如此，改一條件又如何，再改一下又如何？觀察是現代科學的中心，不比古科學之祗用它來決定前提的。今科學的結論仍得用觀察來證實，這一點或者是今古科學分野的最明顯界限。現代演化論如何努力尋求所謂「失去的連系」（Missing　Iink）顯然與古代演化論的完整系統完全不同。</p>
<p>除非了解實騐法在現代科學中的地位，我們決難體會今古科學的基本歧異。古科學有觀察而無實騐，因爲古科學看重本質，所以有時它也不得不憑藉觀察來作分類的根據。它全副精神都在本質上，所以用不著太多的觀察，更用不着改變條件的觀察，原因是它先天地認定條件是偶然的，不是現象的必然本質。其觀點是靜的，故其所謂演化仍不過是開展，現成的開展，而沒有新的創造。今科學的觀點是動的，其對象爲變，相互的關係爲其注意中心，所以條件是科學研究的直接對象，因此不但對現成的事物觀察，而且要改變條件來觀察。這樣，演化便不是消極的開展而是積極的適應。這一動一靜，是今古科學之精神不同處，恐亦是東西文明不同處。</p>
<h3>論學術的獨立</h3>
<p>— 謝佐禹</p>
<p>胡適之先生最近提出中國敎育十年計劃，主張我國在十年之內，集中力量，發展十間太學，使成爲足與歐美大學相抗衡的第一流大學。這樣以後，我國便不必再派留學生到外國去。爲爭取學術的獨立，我們的留學計劃是有終止的必要的。一國的學術，一國的敎育，決不能永遠依賴外國。</p>
<p>胡　計劃提出之後，頗引起國內學人的爭論。不過，這些爭論都不是志在否定胡氏的大前提。胡氏的大前提，或根本主張是，</p>
<p>「爭取學術的獨立」。這一大前提是任何人都不敢否認，也無法否認的。作者自然不想來否認這一大前提，不過作者認為「學術獨的目標，然如何達到這一個目標，却是問題。辦幾間良好的大學，是否即能達到「學術獨立」的目標呢？這是不一定的。這要看「良好」的程度如何而定。而且還有更根本的問題。這更根本的問題不解決，學術仍不會獨立的。</p>
<p>什麽是更根本的問題呢？這就是思想的自宇。所謂思想自主，即思想免除其自身的束縛，不爲傳統思想所囿，也不爲外來思想所侷。而有獨往獨來的自由之謂。民初有「思想解放運動」的提倡，這本來是很好的。可惜的是，這一遝動並不澈底，也沒有達到他們的目標。民初談思想解放的人，只知道擺脫傳統思想的束縛，只知道反對舊道德，舊禮敎，舊文學，舊制度，以爲只要把舊的打倒了，我們的思想便可以解放。他們對於舊的是不分皂白的加以排斥。同時，他們對於新的也不分皂白的加以歡迎。任何思想，只要是新奇的，他們便加以介紹，加以接納。今天一主義，明天一學說，五花八門，無奇不存。差不多西洋的一切都是好的，都是我們所當效法的。所以杜威來華，我們的思想界便跟杜威走。羅素來華，我們的思想界又跟羅素走。杜里舒及泰戈爾來華，我們的思想界復有一部分跟這兩人走。哲學如此，政治，敎育，文學等等，也如此。自民初以迄今茲，我們的思想界都在跟西洋人跑，都在西洋思想範園內兜圈子，都在作西洋思想家的留聲機。他們的思想，即令擺脫了傳統思想的束縛，却並沒有擺脫西洋思想的束縛。不願爲古人思想的奴隸的，却很願意爲今人，爲西人，思想的奴隸。他們解除了一種束縛，却又加上了另一種束縛。他們的思想，始終沒有解放。理由是，他們的思想並不自主，僅為「新奇」二字所歆動，而盲目的東撞西撞而巳。結果，我們的思想界便創始不出什麽新思想來。這樣，還能談什麽學術的獨立呢！</p>
<p>因此，作者認爲　爭取學術的獨立，先要爭取思想的自主。思想不自主，胸無定見，內失所持，唯盲目的仇舊，或盲目的趨新，由今之道，不變民初的作風，則這樣的態度，決不會促成學術的獨立。拿這樣的態度去辦大學，也不會把大學辦得好，最好不過是跟着西洋大學跑，盡模仿之能事，而無法超出之。這不算是學術獨立。學術獨立的根本，在思想自主，在思想的創新。</p>

<h3>現代思潮的動向</h3>
<p>— 謝幼偉</p>
<p>大戰之後，思想界必有一種改變，必有一種新的動向，這是大家期望着，而急欲知道的。思想的衝突，思想的矛盾，可促成人與人之間，民族與民族間的懐疑和誤解。戰爭的形成，與此有關，我們已深切的體驗到。我們決不希望思想的衝突和矛盾。然而擺在我們限前的事實，却似乎就是思想的衝突和矛盾。我們眼見美國和蘇聯兩大集團的對立，在外交上作殊死戰也眼見印度的分裂，以及巴勒斯坦回猶兩旅的對抗。在法國，在義國，在希臘，在中國，也各有其政治上的鬥爭。這些都涵蘊着思想的衝突，政治的或宗敎的。這些衝突又似很尖銳，很嚴重，而沒有調和或統一的可能。表面上，現代思潮呈露着一種分裂，矛盾，而複雜的狀態。這正是關心世界和平的人所引爲隱憂的。</p>
<p>不過當代思想的分裂，矛盾，而複雜的狀態，似乎只是表面的狀態。我們巳隱約着見一綫的曙光從這些狀態中透露出來。實際上當代思想已從分裂，矛盾，而複雜的方向，逐漸轉變到統一，調和，綜合的路上來。我們可以大胆的說，現代思潮的眞正動向，就是朝着統一，調和，及綜合之途而趨。這我們可從各方面來加以考察。</p>
<p>第一，從文化或哲學方而來說，過去我們總認爲東西文化或東西哲學是永無調和統一的可能的。英詩人克　令所謂：「東是東，西是西，東西永不相遇」的話，頗爲許多東西學人所承認。可是現在的一切，都和過去不同了。現在不惟東方人在努力理解西方，努力接受西方文化和哲學，即西方人也在努力理解東方，努力介紹東方文化和哲學。最近美國哲人諾索洛氏（F.S.C.　Northrop）寫了一本「東西相會」（The　Meeting　ofEast　and　West）一書，就是代表這種企圖的。他說：「東方和西方已在相會中，在結合中。克卜令氏所極適當描寫而又極錯誤預言時代已成過去。如我們想理解自身，則我們必須理解東方、如我們想避免另一悲劇，另一慘事，另一流血的發生，則我們必須學習怎樣結合東方和西方的價値，而這種時期已來臨了。」他認爲東西文化不惟有結合的可能，且有結合的必要。惟東西文化的結合，乃能表現事物的眞相，乃能符合科學最近的發現。此外，美哲摩耳氏（CharlesA.Moore）　等又共同編了一本「東西哲學」（Philosophy,East　andWest）一書，主張西方哲人應研究東方哲學。其中霍金敎授（Prof.W.E.Hocking）的一篇有云：「東方人是較聰明的，他的哲學常在實用中，他沒有不在運用中的哲學和宗敎。他的反省是常和他的行動在密切關聯中。我們須得從東方學習玄學的實際意義。會產生如此貧乏的思想體系，如邏輯實證論之宣佈玄學問題爲無意義的民族，其人民實有理由去靜靜領敎東方人的心靈·」由此，我們可以知道現代思想界的工作，確有東西文化和哲學的趨勢。</p>
<p>第二，從政治經濟方面來說，我們也總以為資本主義和共產主州是不兩立的，英美式的民產和蘇聯式的民主是永無結合調和的可能的。現在恐怕還有不少人是這樣相信　，因為當前的局勢所告拆我們的，就是如此。不過，當前的局勢仍是表明的，從當代思想家及政治家的實際工作看來，我們却有理由認為這種對立，這種衝突，是正在統一調和的途中。我們都知道英美方面代表的是資本主義，是政治的民產，可是英美方面的思想家和政治家也都知道這有修正和補充的必要。思想家如杜威，如羅素，如拉斯基，均一致對資本主義有攻擊，有批評。拉斯基氏近著：「信仰，理性，與文明」（Faith,　Reason,　andcivilization）一書，即宣稱今後世界新信仰的成立，不能不以蘇聯的理想爲指南。實際政治家，如前美總統羅斯福的新政，及現英首相艾德禮所執行的政策，都是想把蘇聯經濟民主的理想在英美政治制度之內來實施的，也就是想把經濟民產和政治民主的對立統一起來。他們的企圖，是否成功，雖有問題，至低限度，思想家和實際政治家確是在做這種統一的工作。即蘇聯方面，我們雖聽不到採取英美式的民產的呼聲，但把蘇聯初期的政治和蘇聯現階段的政治來比較，我們不能不承認，蘇聯也在向政治民主之途而趨，不渦進展稍緩而己。可見現代政治經濟的分裂，也有調和統一的趨勢。</p>
<p>第三，從宗敎方面來說，我們更認為這是最無調和統一的希望的。當前宗敎的複　和矛盾，這是政治家和宗敎家所最感覺頭痛的。要把世界的宗敎統一起來，恐怕沒有人敢作此想。不過，當前的宗敎雖這樣復雜而多衝突，然自宗敎演進的歷史言，我們却不能不承認，宗敎不敎也　和統一之途而趨。現代宗敎的複雜總比不上，古代宗敎的複雜。西洋的基督敎，印度的佛敎，以敎徒之衆，分佈之廣言，即做了不少統一的工作。而且當代著名的宗敎家，其思想，其主張，更多半是傾向宗敎之統一與調和。如印度哲人泰戈爾氏當著「人的宗敎」（The　Religion　of　Man）一書，主張以人性之崇拜代替神之崇拜，即有統一宗敎的用意。美哲霍金敎授著「現存宗敎與一種世界信仰」（LivingReligions　and　a　Ｗorld　Faith）一書，也志在綜合現存宗敎的要素以便成立一種世界式的信仰。基督敎的本身本來是派別很多的。除新敎和舊敎之別不論外，新敎本身復有許多派別。可是現在聽說新敎內的許多派別巳有統一結合的趨勢，在某某方面，他們已開始合作。這不能不算是宗敎由分而合的開端。</p>
<p>從上面幾點看來，現代思潮的動向，確是向着統一，調和及綜合之途而努力。他們的工作正在開始，所以他們的成績自不顯著。表面看來，世界思漸自五花八門，非常複雜；但我們　精細的加以探究，則復雜之中已有統一的徵象，衝突之中也有調和的狀態。我們似不必為表　所迷，而對世界思想的矛盾和衝突，過份焦慮，或對世界和平的前途表示絕望。黑暗中已　着一綫光明。我們當歡迎　　光明而盡我們思想界的責任。</p>

<h3>吳經熊語錄</h3>
<p>— 文介</p>
<p>李白用望遠鏡看大自然；杜甫以顯微鏡看大自然。</p>
<p>在李白看來，天上的星星只是螢火蟲；在杜甫看來，地上的螢火蟲直是天上的星星。</p>
<p>視死如歸難，過死一般的生活更難。</p>
<p>突然死去是唯一避免死亡的辦法；須知這樣的死法，在你知過死亡之前你早已死去了。</p>
<p>如果你說上帝只帮助那些帮助自己的人，那麼上帝簡直是像美國的孤立主義者了；我心目中的上帝是帮助那些帮助他人的人的。</p>
<p>要愛人如己，必先愛己如人。</p>
<p>人的偉大不偉大並不依靠外界的環境；對於眞　正偉大的人，逆境只是使他更偉大。</p>
<p>凡是超特的人，在一生中總得有一時期自入世變爲出世，然後再自出世轉爲更高度的入世。</p>
<p>我猜東方與西方之所以不能合流是固爲世間有所謂「偉人」的緣故；在世界上小民有心中東方與西方是從來不曾分裂過的。試讀各國的格言，我們便可知道自古迄今世間各地小民的哲學，是何等的相像。反之，如果你去讀當今「偉人」的政治演說，你便會驚異他們的見解是何等的分歧。</p>
<p>一九二二年的冬天，我到美京華盛頓去訪謁我的老友福爾摩斯（已故美國最高法院審判長）。他領我去參觀他的畫室。他把書架上書一本一本的抽出來，予每本書以近情的評述。最後他說：「我還沒有把這裏最好的書指給你看呢。」我說：「我很想參觀一下。」他說：「你看，那些最好的書都在那一個書架子上。」我的視綫跟隨了他的手指向室中的左角看去，落在一個空的書架子上。我承認簡直是被弄得莫名其妙了。我問主人這是什麽意思：他說道：「我並不是在說笑話。那些最好的書還得寫起來呢！」</p>
<h3>興致與情感</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>旅行的季節行將過去了，但據說每逢週末許多旅行社還是照常客滿，火車和長途汽車的票價雖一再加價，也阻止不了想暫時逃避一下都市　囂的人們的作樂慾。人壽幾何，何不及時行樂！這原是無可厚非的一種感情要求。</p>
<p>遊玩固無所謂目的，但也不是全無目的。你能說感官的享受要求本身不包含着目的嗎？可是預先安排好了的目的，却不一定能滿足我們的享樂要求。二三朋友今夜談得起勁，說是想喫無錫的肉骨頭與炒蟹粉，順便上元頭渚去望望太湖，於是約好明天就跑，這裘有目的，更重要的是有「興致」。</p>
<p>對了。眞正的感情發　是不能沒有興致這份心情的。發乎興致的遊樂和為了要找求一時刺激的遊樂，雖同是感情的流露，却有着眞與僞的重要分別。</p>
<p>就拿眼前一般人的旅行熱來說吧。祇要你有的是錢，一個電話就可以向一家旅行社登記你願往的目的地，車票，飲食，住宿，甚至游玩的節目，都不用你煩心，從你府上到目的地不要你跑多少路，而且最後仍將你送回府上。這是多麽省力便利。可是這樣雖滿足了你的旅行慾，但究竟滿足了你多少興致呢？</p>
<p>問題不在旅行社代你佈置得大週到了；即怕是當天來回的急行式的旅行，只要你是發乎眞情趣，就在走馬看花中，亦能滿足你的興致——發乎自然的感情。</p>
<p>這僅是一個淺薄的比喻。　是在眼前的生活環境中，使人能激發眞感情的事情確是千奇百怪的形式，炫耀與時髦成了生活的主要情調，叫囂的誇張的空氣掩蓋了一切。新聞標題窮思極想要找每天的Headline，文章要講究刺激，做人要有「　頭」，實色，黑色，白色，赤色甚至灰色的一切籠眾了人世。藝術和學術的空氣焉無存，嚴　的表　下是一片荒唐。</p>
<p>這並不是冷酷的犬儒主義式的見解。眼前的生活現象確是十分可怕。現在有些人在談挽救人心了。但在我個人看來，這還不是所謂世風日下的簡單問題。重振道德云云是無所謂的，問題是在於人的眞情在重重虛僞的形式下被壓制得快要全滅了。要洗滌這種風氣，不是一時一地所能辦到。此時重要的是讓每個人能在個別的生活圈子中去勉力保持地自己的一份引領興致，也就是保持他的一份眞情感。有人訾議玩物喪志，但在今天，祗要你還能保持着一份「玩」的興致，你正不愁會得因此而墮落。要知眞　正的嚴肅精神，不僅與眞的情感不相悖，而且後者還是促成前者的的一個重要動機。</p>

<h3>可怕的冷漠</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>南庫頁島一百多個男女老幼僑胞，在居留數十年之後，終於忍受不了新的佔領當局的壓迫，無可奈何地拋掉了僅剩下的一點基業，在凜冽的寒風中，回到了祖國。</p>
<p>然而，祖所給他們的是什麽呢？——竟是一片難堪的冷漠！運送他們回國的蘇聯當局和外交部駐滬辦事處商量，外交部駐滬辦事處却恐怕正是上海最窮的一個政府機關。找僑務委員會上海僑務處罷，也沒有錢。再找行總，行總說是救濟事宜早已結束。最後是吳市長總算答應了供給他們一個嚴期的給養。一星期是很快就會過去的，到過了之後他們的生活怎樣維持，就還在未定之天。如果讓我說得殘酷一點，也許，到那個時候，健忘的上海人，早就把他們忘掉了！</p>
<p>在荷印，無數僑胞遷徙流亡，橫遭劫掠殘殺，至今印尼當局賠償損失的諾言還祗是一句空話，至今他們的生命財產還是毫無安全的保障。在印度，新疆回胞朝聖團歷次爲戰亂所阻，中央社有一次報道說是衣食都發生了問題，之後，就不再聽見提起。在戰後的日本，也居然發生了所謂澀谷事件！</p>
<p>如果說國內的民衆們對僑胞是故意的不理睬，倒也並非如比。事實上是比「故意不理睬」還要可怕的，他們根本「忘記」了國外的僑胞原來也還是中國人！</p>
<h3>達夫二三事</h3>
<p>— 馬彬</p>
<p>識郁達夫先生，在十五年前那時達夫尙從事小說創作，惟作風已小異於創造社時，著名之「采石磯」與「碧浪湖的秋夜」，即此期作品；及其移家杭州，始多寫散文遊記之類，時滬報喜稱渠為「遊記作家」，郁亦自樂之。</p>
<p>在杭州，達夫的經濟情况雖不怎麼寬裕，但究竟是「太平盛世」，賣文買酒，綽有餘裕，生活情趣與亂離之世，不可同日而語。達夫嗜飲，以酒招，無有不往，其醉宿杏花村有句云：「十日秋陰水拍天，湖山雖好未容　；但憑極賤杭州酒，爛醉西泠岳墳前。」此情此景，今已不可追憶矣。</p>
<p>達夫在杭居，喜交遊，達官顯貴以至窮人學生，對之如一，邵力子係渠在滬舊識，宣鐵吾，周象賢，趙龍文等人與郁交誼俱深。憶渠酬趙龍文「茍活人間再十年」之句，湖山如昨，舊遊已不可回首。</p>
<p>達夫善自我陶醉，嘗市航空一一獎券，期以必中，並計派用途爲：一萬元匯富陽奉母，一萬五千元養杭州家，五千元送朋友，自留二萬金偕一妙女，同遊四海……吾　　　道之，即　後說居蘇門答臘，新婚之夜，亦寫。「何日西施隨范蠡，五湖煙水說恩仇」，達夫以此理想排遣中年，然終實志以歿，惜哉。</p>
<h3>外國人看京戲</h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>戲裏的女主角立在台的極前面，雙手按胸，用一種低沉的歌曲唱出了她的無法忍受的苦難。於是她背轉身，高高舉足，走了一步。樂隊立刻着力地演奏起來，饒跋的弦樂並作，意思是要呌聽衆知道：她已經投海自殺了。</p>
<p>看客們點頭贊許。樂隊　喧鬧之聲突變不一種緊張的急板，男主角跳到台上，雙腿僵直。他夵下了一根馬鞕，表示他業已下馬，然後用手向額前微微一遮，以避大海　劇烈的反光，一眼望見了那將要沉下去的少女，他就一步跨到了海裏（此時饒鈸之聲大作），把那少女救了起來。</p>
<p>看客們　然很表滿意，他們舒適地靠在椅背上看着。自有萬里長城以來，他們就是　歡這一套的。祇耍看他們克惠然肯來，就可知他們實在喜歡此道。須知一部京戲比連看兩塲電影所費的時候還要長久，普通的戲要以下午七點一直做到十一點，禮拜天的「好」戲更需要從七點一直做到一兩點鐘。</p>
<p>他們之所以喜歡京戲，一半也許是因爲這是一種演員和觀衆打成一片的戲劇。戲院裏的電燈是從來不熄滅的。台上的布景如果的劇情有合符之處，那不過是偶然的巧合，劇情究竟在何時發生，大部都需要觀衆自己想像。除了戲台比池座稍稍高了一點之外，演員和觀衆之間簡直就並無鴻溝。</p>
<p>賣報的，賣糖果的，賣水果和汽水的小阪們出出進進，川流不息，生意異隆。</p>
<p>台上仍舊正經地做戲。戲裏歹徒同時也是丑角，他伸出一只手指向鼻子下面一擦，觀衆就給哈大笑。後來他愈來愈刁惡，你可以看出觀衆對他是何等痛恨。等到最緊張的一幕到臨，他準備上吊自殺，不想繫繩的窗　忽然斷掉，他跌了一交，觀衆這一下可眞是笑得前仰後合了。……</p>
<p>譯者按：每有外國使節來華，或有什麽國際性的會議在華舉行，好像請他們看一次京戲已成為題中應有的文章。但是外國人眼中的京戲究竟如何呢？十一月十五日出版的Collier＇s雜誌有一短文，讀之啞然，合　譯出。</p>
<h3>氣節</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>柳南隨筆載有廬山僧幻住，哭其兄詩云：「身經刀過頭方貴，尸不封泥骨始香。」隨國詩話載一女子當國破時赴江死（惜忘其名），其途中口號云：「寄語路人休掩鼻，活人不及死人香！」兩人之詩，都是沈著痛快，一字一血，實足彪炳千秋。至如汪逆精衛獄中詩「引刀成一快，不負少年頭。」其豪爽之氣，亦虎虎逼人，使汪逆死於此時，自是大義凜然，萬世景仰，用不着後人「大風吹倒梧桐樹，自有旁人說短長」了。然此逆此時偏偏不死，而却死於作了巨奸之後，眞是好死不死，多吃飯米！太史公所謂死有泰山鴻毛之別，即此之謂乎！白樂天詩云：「周公恐懼流言日，王莾謙恭下士時；假使常年身便死，一生眞僞有誰知！」如果詩也可以移借的話，我爲之移來借咏其事。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第一章　喜得知音　（二）</p>
<p>說着，見渚齋直挺挺站在旁邊，便笑道：「我忘了給你們介紹，你二位都是梅派的信徒，彼此也該認識認識。」便指著渚齋對少女道：「他是我的內姪徐渚齋，」又指少女道：「她是大名鼎鼎的顧綺　顧老板，大槪我不介紹她，你也認得。」渚齋一見少女面貌，　就猜出是顧綺紈，現給肖柏一說，走近一步，微微一鞠躬，稱一聲顧老板。綺紈把頭一點，微微一笑，心裏却覺得這人長得太俊美，可稱得起很夠味兒的一個美男子，不禁又對他看了一看。渚齋却對肖柏說道：「我們到來今雨軒坐坐吧，這裏風太大，姑丈你身體不好，不要老站在這裏。」肖柏點點頭，領了諸人到來今雨軒，在茶座坐下。肖柏因早上沒吃東西，要了一杯鮮牛奶，渚齋和綺紈各要了一杯可可。肖柏一邊喝著牛奶，一邊對渚齋問道：「你近來常到這裏吊嗓呀？」渚齊很靦　道：「不，我因爲今晚廣播電臺允我淸唱，我怕臨時唱壊了，先來這裏吊吊嗓。」肖柏道：「你剛才唱玉堂春，學梅先生腔調很好，只有一二字字眼，咬的不大對，你不是丙行的，能有這種程度，已是很難得的了。」渚齋臉上微微一紅道：「姑丈你別稱讓，只說我那幾個字眼　的不對？」肖柏把玻璃杯裏最後一口牛奶喝乾，把杯放下，笑指着綺紈道：「她也是私淑梅先生的弟子，你只間他就知道了。」綺紈和渚齋是初次見面，明知他唱錯，那從便說出，只微微一笑道：「費老板別爲難我了，我那裏懂得！」肖柏道：「你們二人，都是梅門私淑弟子，都可以成名的。渚齋，你是偶爾游戲，唱得對唱得不對，原無所謂；綺紈那樣天賦好嗓子，必須親拜梅先生門下，得他的眞傳，不但耍學他行腔，就是他的姿熊台步等等，也都該硏究的。」綺紈道：「是的，我早蓄此志，只爲梅先生現遠在香港，我無從拜他門下。」肖柏道：「將來你總有拜師的機會呀！若論梅先生的道德，在現在梨園界裏，是首屈一指，稱得起是一位君子。就以我來說，所受梅先生提拔好處就不少。常年在上海演戲，因為譚老板沒趕到，請我頂替，我當時被邀，心裹非常害怕，深怕配不上，牽累了梅先生。在未演之先，我先到梅先生那裏請敎，梅先生極力鼓勵我說：只要細心體貼戲情，沒有配不上的，他又說我的戲，比別人來得細緻，能深懂得戲情，是書本有根底的。我聽這幾句話，眞是感激涕零，認為知己。到了上演那一晚，我提心吊胆，竭盡我的能力想討好，終因胆怯，在台上有幾次都露出弱點，梅先生都給我托過，不但沒當塲露醜，反博臺下采聲。」</p>

<p>華北軍事一張一弛，時急時緩，前此攻下煙台，人心振奮，最近失去石門，現象又見緊張。若論兩年來確保戰果，衆口交稱者，則推傳作　之收復張家口，不但把握「邊關重鎭」（張家口「大境門」內有此坊），而且控制中綏交通，靈活了西北脈絡，關係非輕。（由北平分張之三大幹綫平漢路之河北段久已被阻，平津路亦時遭破壊，惟平綏路　利穩要，傳部保衛之力。）又有餘力，援遼東，援河北，所到之處，先聲奪人，　然保障一方之中堅人物。</p>
<p>北方將領「忠義二將」，鼎鼎大名，無獨有偶。山西傳作「義」，山東子學「忠」，皆以孤軍奮鬥擅長。二十年前，「義將」以晋軍進　　州，「忠將」以魯軍獨守南陽，以　敵衆，不約而同，可稱奇蹟</p>
<p>抗戰期間，「義將」支柱西北，「忠將」轉戰魯南，並著勇名。而今「忠將」任職中權，固是軍機要務，而以其半生戎馬之　塲生活觀之，可謂「絢爛歸於平淡」；惟「義將」老當益壯，依然「馬上將軍」，且爲「常勝將軍」，前月　吉緊張，被邀出關參助，最近石莊警報，北平行轅亦約來　畫戎機（十八日與議，十九日返張），眞　將也。</p>
<p>提起十六年　州之役，聯想到張學良氏。當時張作霖自立軍政府於東北，山西圖錫山已參加北伐，而直　（今河北）全省在張掌握。傳承閻命率一旅由小道進而據　，距北平極近，其冒險精神，極似三國鄧艾之　陰平。時張學良率其三四方面大軍　　累月，屢攻不下，後由紳商奔走，以愛惜民命而開城。張學良欽其義勇，敬禮逾値。</p>
<p>次年六月北伐成功，學良先已傾城反正，勸父出關，自爲留後。其父被日人炸斃，學良繼長關東，解決張宗昌殘部，又不顧日人阻難，縣掛靑天白日旗，不失爲深明大義。後數年，在陝受人愚弄，陷於大錯，幸即悔悟，從此隱跡林泉，度安甜之生活，有紿有終，不失為聰明人，不負其名「學良」，其字「漢　」矣。</p>
<p>西漢之初，張良　佐漢高，為三傑之一，功成身退，辟穀學道，從赤松子游，以功名終。此張學良之所以「學張良」字「漢卿」。</p>
<p>東漢初，馮異將軍佐光武，討王莾，興漢室，性行謙退，每値諸將論功，異獨避於樹下，時稱「大樹將軍」，為雲　畫像功臣之一。現在美洲之馮將軍當初有功北伐，計年已近古稀，旣游新大陸，正好快樂餘年，而乃屢對外人批評國內，有類乎「吿洋狀」者，失態失詞，甚為可惜。彼若有歷史知識，當善學其宗先　馮異，庶不讓「學張良者」專美於前。</p>
<p>傅名作「義」·于日學「忠」張能學「良」·馮不學「異」</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] When Chairman Chiang dined with cultural and educational figures such as Hu Shi and Mei Yi-qi in Beiping, he talked about the U.S. occupation policy towards Japan. A certain participant told reporters that the Chairman said that some people in the country believe that the United States is supporting Japan and neglecting China, and therefore worry that Japan will once again form a force to invade China. This view is too extreme. The United States will never do this. The problem is that we must first strengthen ourselves and not fear the re-emergence of others. After the victory, China was generous to Japan. Today, talking about the policy towards Japan is still sincere, hoping that Japan will become a truly democratic country. The Chairman also hopes that Hu Shi and others will go to Japan for observation to help the people understand the Japan issue. Hu and others may go to Japan after the Spring Festival.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Statement on the Sino-Burmese Border Issue</h3>
<p>Will be Resolved Through Diplomatic Channels</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that due to inconsistent reports in Chinese and Burmese newspapers regarding the Sino-Burmese border demarcation issue, a statement clarifying the position of our government is made as follows: Regarding the Yunnan-Burma border, China and Britain concluded an agreement in March 1894. Except for the section south of Jian Gao Mountain, which has been jointly surveyed by China and Britain, the section north of Jian Gao Mountain is governed by Article 4 of the agreement: "The boundary line of the section north of 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude will be determined by the two countries after future investigation of the situation there." The section of the boundary line north of 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude referred to in the treaty text is the section north from Jian Gao Mountain. Although China and Britain have negotiated on this section of the boundary line, they have not reached an agreement. On August 18, 1941, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to the British Embassy in China to continue discussions on this undetermined boundary line in the spirit of friendship and harmony, so that this long-standing issue can be resolved. On November 17 of the same year, the British Embassy replied: It has been forwarded to the British government and the Burmese government for consideration, and will be forwarded as soon as a reply is received. Subsequently, the Pacific War broke out and Burma fell. The Chinese government did not receive any further replies from the British side regarding this matter. Now that Burma is about to become independent, the Chinese government and people are very gratified. Regarding this undetermined section of the Yunnan-Burma border, it is believed that China and independent Burma, in the spirit of friendship and harmony between the two peoples, and the existing provisions of the treaty, will not be difficult to seek a reasonable, legal, and satisfactory solution through proper diplomatic channels. At this time, any one-sided statements or actions cannot force the other party to consider them valid.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Council Opening Ceremony; Approves Provisional Motion Demanding the Return of Ryukyu</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] The fourth session of the Taiwan Provincial Council opened at 9 a.m. on the 1st.

He hoped that the people and the government would jointly prevent high prices and overcome difficulties, and emphasized that the income from Japanese assets should be allocated to repair Central Government projects in Taiwan. Chairman Wei still maintained an optimistic belief that he would overcome economic fluctuations with an unwavering mentality. During the ceremony, Qiu Nian-tai, Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Li Chong-li, a member of the Provincial Council, criticized the distorted reports from foreign newspapers. Councillor's provisional motion: Please request the Central Government to thoroughly negotiate so that Ryukyu is returned to our country. He said: The Ryukyu people's blood, language, culture, customs, and habits are completely different from those of the Japanese. Historically, they have only had relationships of enemies, and no friendly relationships. They were one with China 500 years ago. The King of Ryukyu was captured to Japan before being forcibly occupied. Ryukyu is the northern barrier of Taiwan, an important national defense center, and is closely related to us. It should be returned urgently. The motion was then implemented in enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. The handling of the Peace and Security Office was concentrated and trained, and the banditry was greatly reduced, and the security had been greatly improved. The conference will continue until the 13th.</p>

<h3>Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East; Rejects the Indonesian Observer Request; Chiang Tingfu May Arrive in Shanghai From the Philippines</h3>
<p>[United Press, Baguio Dispatch, 1st] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East rejected a motion by India, by a vote of five to four, to allow the Republic of Indonesia to send a delegation to attend the meeting as an observer without the right to speak or vote. India, the Soviet Union, the Philippines, and Pakistan voted in favor. The UK, US, France, the Netherlands, and Australia voted against it. China abstained. Chinese representative Chiang Tingfu strongly argued that the meeting should give secondary status to political issues. It is claimed that: If the current progress continues, the Chinese government will simply refuse to participate. Chiang also replied to reports that he would be appointed as the Chinese ambassador to the Philippines, stating: I have other work to do. The misunderstanding arose because I said that I would be honored if I could serve as ambassador to the Philippines. Chiang is now planning to take a Northwest Airlines plane back to Shanghai. If the weather is good, he will arrive at 3 p.m. on the 2nd. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>Election Results of All Provinces and Cities Must be Reported to the Election Headquarters by the 10th; List of Regional National Assembly Representatives Will be Publicly Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Occupational Women's Election Committee held its 13th meeting at 3 p.m. on the 1st, chaired by Gu Zhenggang. The following was passed: December 3 is the date for the public announcement of the list of elected regional National Assembly representatives and candidates. However, for national occupational women's organizations, the election headquarters will compile the results of the vote count from each county and city election office. The number of votes each candidate receives is reported to the provincial election office for compilation and forwarded to the national election headquarters for a total count to determine the elected and alternate candidates according to law. The deadline for the submission of the vote count results from all provinces and cities has been decided to be December 10. All provinces and cities must compile and report to the headquarters by that date. Failure to do so by the deadline, resulting in the inability to calculate the total, will be the responsibility of the provincial or city election office. The National Assembly election for national occupational women's organizations should be conducted in accordance with the Electoral Recall Law as specified in Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Election Supplementary Regulations. Any places that fail to hold elections on schedule will not be re-elected, so as not to affect the calculation of votes in other provinces and cities in the same area.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] A government spokesperson stated today that they are currently working hard to ensure that the National Assembly will open as scheduled on December 25. However, if the number of elected representatives from all regions received by the capital at that time is not full, a postponement is almost unavoidable. The Electoral Head Office remains tight-lipped as to when the results of last month's full ballot count will be released. According to well-informed sources, the election process was plagued by irregularities and complaints, resulting in a fairly chaotic situation.</p>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch, 1st] The election of regional and occupational group National Assembly representatives in Anhui Province, except for 18 counties where the elections will be held at a later date due to banditry, has been completed on schedule.

<h3>There Will Be Changes to the Organization of the Five Yuan; Legislative Yuan Discusses the Legality of Political Parties, Decides to Refer the Issue to the Next Elective Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The organizational laws of the Five Yuan are currently under review by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan. The organization of each Yuan will undergo slight changes, such as the addition of a Health Committee to the Legislative Yuan and changes to the Supervisory Envoy Office of the Control Yuan. The small group meeting held on the 1st has not yet yielded results.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The State Council previously submitted a proposal to the Legislative Yuan requesting the drafting of regulations. The reason for the proposal is that there are many political parties in our country, but there are no explicit provisions on which are legal. Especially during the general election, there are discrepancies in the nomination of candidates by political parties. Although the State Council made an informal decision that all political parties that participated in the constitution-making process are legal, there are no formal rules to follow. Therefore, the matter was referred to the Legislative Yuan to draft formal regulations. The Legislative Yuan convened a small group meeting on the 1st to discuss the principles of the organization of political groups. It was determined that this regulation is unprecedented in our country and lacks precedent in Europe and the West. It was then decided to refer the matter to the future elected Legislative Yuan for handling. [Another dispatch] The issue of coordinating the quota of legislative committee candidates nominated by political parties was previously discussed at a nine-person group meeting co-hosted by the Kuomintang and the Democratic Youth Party, but no solution was reached. Xu Chuanlin and others from the Democratic Socialist Party took a night train to Shanghai on the 30th to convene a central standing committee meeting for discussion. After deliberation in Beijing, the Youth Party sent a reply to the Kuomintang on the 1st, stating that the original nomination list could no longer be changed. Therefore, the coordination of the legislative committee list is still under study.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] It is reported that Zhang Junli has been internally designated as the head candidate for the Democratic Socialist Party in this city. The party held a central standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the regional distribution of legislative committee candidates. After the meeting, a certain official stated: "The legislative committee is different from the National Assembly. On average, five members can be produced in each district, and up to six in some cases. Among the more than 700 legislative committee members, the Democratic and Youth parties each account for only a small minority of 75. The authorities will eventually find a solution to the regional distribution issue. Therefore, the party's internal discussions today did not intend to make major changes to the original plan. As the results of the National Assembly elections have not yet been officially announced, discussion will be reserved for the time being. As for the technical issue of the proportion of Democratic and Youth Party members participating in the local council, the Youth Party is currently in talks with the Kuomintang Central Committee."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Far East Communist Information Bureau</h3>
<p>Following the establishment of the European Information Bureau, the Communist International is also planning to organize an information bureau in the Far East. We received a report from a news agency as early as the middle of last month. According to a United Press dispatch from Hong Kong on November 16th, we already knew that the Communist Parties in various parts of the Far East were preparing to establish an information bureau in the Far East after the European Communist Parties established an information bureau in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, and were scheduled to convene a meeting in Harbin on November 20th to announce its establishment and issue a declaration. On the 29th of last month, Reuters also reported that the Far East Communist Information Bureau was established in Harbin on November 20th. Representatives from the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, Outer Mongolia, China, and Korea participated in the establishment meeting. Representatives from the Japanese Communist Party were unable to attend because they did not obtain exit passports. The conference resolved to establish the Far East Communist Information Bureau and to closely cooperate in the struggle for autonomy in various Far Eastern countries, as well as to promote the Communist revolution. According to a United Press dispatch on the same day, the Far East Communist Information Bureau decided to be established in Vladivostok. A report from London on the same day also confirmed the plan of the Communist Parties in various parts of the Far East to convene a meeting to establish an information bureau. Thus, we can know that the Communist International has already convened a meeting in the Far East to establish an information bureau, and plans to promote the Communist revolution in various parts of the Far East and intensify mutual cooperation. Although we have not yet had the opportunity to read the declaration issued by this conference, this declaration is, in fact, not of much significance. We have already seen the declaration of the Communist International establishing the European Information Bureau; the Far East Communist Information Bureau was subsequently established, and the declaration it issued would not be substantially different from the European one. Even if there is a distance, it does not seem to be too far apart. The reason why we have not read this declaration now may be that the Communist International wants to choose a time they consider appropriate to publish it.</p>
<p>We are not surprised by the arrival of this news. When the Communist International established the European Information Bureau in Europe in October, we said that the emergence of the European Communist Information Bureau cannot be said to be a new wall in the international arena, but rather the reappearance of the Communist International. The Communist International has long existed, and its appearance on the international political stage did not begin today. The Communist International's declaration of dissolution in May 1943 was to please Western democratic countries, especially to obtain a large amount of Lend-Lease materials from the United States. Therefore, the Kremlin announced the dissolution of the Communist International, which had been established in the Lenin era, with a piece of announcement. It was nothing more than a set of methods played by Moscow. The international communist movement and the world revolution movement were not affected by the Communist International's declaration of dissolution. Therefore, the appearance of the Communist International in the form of the European Communist Information Bureau is by no means the emergence of a new wall, but an old wall that has already been built, re-hanging its banner and preparing to declare war. Since this is the case, then the fact that the Communist International also appears in the Far East in the form of an information bureau is natural and not surprising.</p>
<p>Due to the establishment of the Far East Communist Party Information Bureau, our country believes that the following points should be pointed out:</p>
<p>First, the Communist Party is an international organization, and the Communist Parties in various places have a consistency in "belief", and the Chinese Communist Party is naturally no exception. In the past, there was a time when the Chinese Communist Party tried its best to win over Britain and the United States, so they themselves thought that they were only a peasant revolutionary party, which was different in nature from the Communist Parties in other countries. This was a distorted propaganda made by them to cover themselves up, but unexpectedly some British and American people believed it to be true and acted as propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party. What is even more regrettable is that some senior diplomats, people who hold the position of ambassador, also echoed the Chinese Communist Party without thinking. Now that the true face of the Communist Party is becoming more and more known to the world, and the Chinese Communist Party has also joined the organization of the Far East Information Bureau, its so-called peasant revolutionary movement can no longer deceive the world. What we want to point out here is that the Chinese Communist Party is a link in the Communist International's promotion of world revolution, and it has no independent existence. The establishment of the Far East Communist Information Bureau further confirms this fact. We want to clearly tell the world not to be poisoned by the Communist Party's propaganda again.</p>
<p>Second, due to the establishment of the Far East Information Bureau and the resolutions passed at the Harbin meeting, we can foresee that the activities of the Communist Party in various parts of the Far East will become more active in the future. In Northeast and North China, the Chinese Communist Party is deliberately sabotaging, and our government cannot but mobilize to suppress the chaos. The same situation may also occur in other parts of the Far East. In Zhao Nan, in the Philippines, in Burma, in Malaya, etc., there are a large number of Communist Party members lurking, and they have actively launched activities in various regions, and may have received a large number of military supplies from the Japanese army. They can choose a time to launch armed struggles in various places in the same way. China has suffered from the disaster of the Communist Party for more than 20 years, and we are familiar with the tricks of the Communist Party. Due to the establishment of the Communist Far East Information Bureau, we must raise the world's vigilance against the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Third, due to the establishment of the Far East Communist Information Bureau, the true face of the Communist International's world revolution is further exposed. This reminds us of our current suppression of the chaos, which seems like our independent resistance against Japan back then, but its hardship is even greater than back then. Back then, we had an obvious foreign enemy, but now our enemy is not as obvious as the Japanese warlords back then; but its harm, because it has an international prospect, is far greater than the Japanese warlords back then. We must raise the awareness of the people of our country about our current enemy, mobilize together, and participate in the suppression of the chaos; on the one hand, we must urge the world to pay attention that in today's world when the Communist Parties in various places are preparing to promote world revolution, only our China is facing our enemy independently, which is also the chaos of the world. We hope that people from all over the world can face up to the world significance of our mobilization to suppress the chaos, and further have new plans and new decisions for the entire world's suppression of the chaos; only in this way can the world's lasting peace be guaranteed.</p>
<p>The execution of traitor Yin Rugeng by shooting. (Top) Traitor Yin ×, a few minutes before the execution, still published his fallacies to the audience who came to observe the execution. (Bottom) The remains of traitor Yin after the shooting. (Photo by Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Process of Yin Rugeng's Execution by Shooting</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) At 10:11 AM one morning, supervising prosecutor Wang Wenzhun, accompanied by warden Xu Chongwen and clerk Wu Jingxin, opened a temporary court in the prisoners' workshop near the execution ground. At 10:20 AM, traitor Yin was brought in, wearing a dark blue silk-faced cotton robe, the collar open, blue silk cotton pants, black satin shoes, and a beige velvet-cord melon-skin hat. His face was very plump, but his anxiety was evident in his expression, his complexion was pale, and he was at a loss. After the court inquired about his name, age, and place of origin, it asked him what crime he had committed as usual. Traitor Yin was reluctant to answer. When the court asked if it was the case of a traitor, he hesitated for a long time before saying in a hoarse voice: "Probably!" He seemed to be overwhelmed with shame and regret. Then the court announced: The execution order of the Ministry of Justice has been transferred by the Supreme Court and will be executed immediately. Traitor Yin then sat down to write, and in an attempt to appear calm, he first wrote four lines of the Diamond Sutra: "All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows, like dew and lightning; thus should you contemplate them." Then he wrote letters to his history teacher, brother, sons, daughters, wives, concubines, and defense lawyer Zhang Shizhao, and his driver Zhang Jigen, a total of seven letters, which took more than half an hour. At this point, traitor Yin asked the executioner to be quick and reduce his pain, and asked to sit quietly and accept the execution so that he could chant Buddhist prayers. At 11:00 AM, the supervising officer ordered him to be taken to the execution ground. Traitor Yin reluctantly asked to talk to the spectators, and in a lecturing manner, he talked about his traitorous philosophy, saying: Although he was sanctioned by national law, he was still sacrificing for the country. Outsiders did not understand and called him a traitor, but in fact, it was not the case. He was stopped by the supervising officer, and as he turned to walk to the prepared stool, a shot entered the back of his head and exited from his left eye. Traitor Yin jumped up and fell down, and turned upward, still not out of breath. After four minutes, the executioner fired another shot to end his life, at 11:12 AM. This old, ugly, and treacherous figure, who combined the crimes of internal rebellion and foreign aggression, came to an end.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Discusses Sino-Philippine Trade</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one)</p>
<p>"Central News Agency Baguio, a United Press dispatch of the 1st" Jiang Tingfu told a United Press reporter that the Philippines and China should establish mutually beneficial trade and economic agreements in accordance with the objectives of the Asian and Far Eastern Economic Commission. Jiang said that China needs Philippine materials, but can also sell more rice and oil to the Philippines. The Philippines may also purchase a large number of porcelain, tea, and raw silk from China. Regarding the resolutions of the Asian and Far Eastern Economic Conference, Jiang said: "The resolutions we passed here are not binding, but only suggestions for solving the economic problems of this region." He advocated that the conference location should be chosen in rotation, and he would like to see the next conference held in Burma or India, but he believed that the secretariat of the conference should be located in Shanghai. Jiang expressed regret over the conference's debate on political issues, because it was an unnecessary waste of time. The conference should deal with food, transportation, fuel, trade, and other similar issues.</p>
<p>"Another dispatch" The first and second groups of the Far East Economic Commission held a meeting on the morning of the 1st, which was still in progress after noon.

He was very confident about his illness, and said that this return to Sichuan was just in time for the Chengdu Flower Fair next year. When President Zhang went to the airport to see him off today, he was detained by the guards at the gate of the airport because he did not have an entry and exit permit in his car and did not carry a business card with him. After seven or eight minutes, an air force officer testified that he was indeed Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan before he was released and allowed to enter.</p>

As a result, many died due to the heat and hunger, and many were beaten to death.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Destroy Churches, Capture and Kill Priests and Parishioners</h3>

Furthermore, the North China General Seminary of the Catholic Church in Zhuangyuan Village outside the South Gate, which is presided over by the local priest Wen De'er, and another Belgian professor and priest Ge Mulin (Doctor of Philosophy from Belgium), who is skilled in medicine, are both being monitored by the bandits and subjected to humiliation, barely having enough to eat each day. In addition to the priests, the bandits are advocating "individual struggle to save the people," forcing people to renounce their faith. More than twenty parishioners in various places who remained loyal and unwilling to apostatize have been executed.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions Established, First Congress Inaugurated</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dispatch of the 1st" The National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions of the Republic of China, which has been in preparation for more than two years, has now been formally established. At 9:00 a.m. today, the opening ceremony of the first joint representative congress was held at the Nanjing Workers' Welfare Society. Vice Chairman Sun Ke, Minister Chen Chanfu, Minister Gu Zhenggang, Minister Yu Dawei, and Minister Ma Chaojun all attended. Liu Songshan, Chairman of the Congress, delivered an opening speech, stating: The preparation of the Railway Federation began in June of the 34th year (1945) and has taken two and a half years to formally establish. During the later stages of the War of Resistance, the Review Committee organized railway workers to cooperate in combat. After the capital was moved, it led the national employees to cooperate with the general mobilization order, focusing on preventing spies and assisting in suppressing the rebellion. Now that it has been formally established, its mission is even more significant.</p>
<p>Sun Ke's Address Vice Chairman Sun delivered an address, stating in brief: The Railway Federation is established based on the newly promulgated Trade Union Law of May this year. The purpose of the Trade Union Law is to enhance the knowledge of employees, improve technology, promote labor-management coordination, seek employee welfare, and improve work efficiency. He hoped that all railway employees would cooperate with the national mobilization policy, working hard to maintain transportation and seeking their own progress in order to promote social progress and lead the country onto the path of industrialization. In the past, our country lacked trade union organizations, especially national organizations. Today, the establishment of the national Railway Federation is of great significance and marks the initial success of the new Trade Union Law. Among the six major plans in Sun Yat-sen's The International Development of China, four are related to transportation, with railways as the main goal. The importance of the mission borne by the railways is evident here, and he hoped that the mission could be accomplished.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu's Address Minister Chen Lifu, in his address, emphasized the importance of organization and unity, saying: The value of the organization itself lies in strengthening each member through the organization, so that a huge force is generated under the same goal. Workers are the center of revolution and construction, as history has repeatedly proven. He hoped that the Railway Federation employees would strive for their own unity and, in the current stage, through the Railway Federation's organization, assume the task of eliminating counter-revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Gu Zhenggang's Address Minister Gu Zhenggang encouraged employees to actively participate in the work of suppressing the rebellion, earnestly organize the people along the railway, eliminate spies and bandits, maintain a consistent spirit, and do their best to repair the damaged railway. He also encouraged the Railway Federation to strengthen its leadership, participate in the implementation of constitutional government and railway construction, cultivate new cadres, and pay attention to improving work efficiency in trade union organizations, so that trade union organizations become increasingly sound.</p>
<p>Yu Dawei's Remarks Minister Yu Dawei stated: Today's railways are facing some difficulties. Essential railway materials, such as steel rails, sleepers, and communication equipment, are in short supply. The railways are being damaged daily, manpower is insufficient, and the overall railway expenditure is also significantly different. Currently, we can only rely on the hard work of all employees to save the current crisis. In the past year, employees in various regions have shown good performance. He hoped to maintain this spirit and contribute personal sacrifices to seek welfare for 400 million compatriots.</p>
<p>Ma Chaojun's Address Minister Ma Chaojun recounted the history of the railway employees' struggle over the past thirty years and stated: Through the struggle of the past thirty years, we have obtained constitutional guarantees and freedom of participation in government. This fact will defeat the communist bandits' slander and propaganda. He hoped that employees will strive to improve the organizational structure, cultivate a service concept, and make the Railway Federation a true bridge between management and workers, taking on the responsibility of resolving difficulties and disputes. Workers are the foundation of nation-building, and he especially hoped that workers would cherish themselves and others, and not disgrace their position and mission.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony concluded at 12:00 noon. More than 60 trade union representatives attended the ceremony, representing 300,000 railway employees across the country. The establishment of the National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions during the current suppression of the rebellion is truly unprecedented in the history of our country's railways.</p>
<p>"Another Dispatch" The National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions of the Republic of China will hold its first National Congress of Members' Representatives starting from the 1st, lasting for three days. The opening ceremony was held on the morning of the 1st, and proposals were reviewed in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Rich Gold Deposits in the Dang River Area, Report from the Qaidam Survey Team</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Lanzhou, Dispatch of the 1st" The area of more than a hundred li stretching across the Qilian Mountains from the Dang River to the Haer River is extremely rich in gold deposits. This is reported by the Qinghai-Xinjiang Border Region and Qaidam Industrial and Mining Resources Survey Team of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in a telegram from Dunhuang. According to the report, when the third group of the team was traveling in the Dang River area, a porter accidentally picked up a gold nugget weighing two qian. As a result, they stayed in the area for several months to conduct a survey and determined that large-scale mining was indeed necessary. A detailed report will be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review after returning to Lanzhou. After entering the mountains from Dunhuang, the first group of the team followed the established route through the Dangjin Pass, crossed the Arjin Mountains, and conducted a general survey northward from the western edge of Qaidam. They have now reached Tiebiao Daike and will proceed to Hongliugou before returning to Dunhuang. The work of the second group has reached Qieshi and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. After all three groups return to Dunhuang, the entire team will return to Lanzhou. The team was formed in January of this year and began its work. In July, it was obstructed by the Hami people and stayed in Dunhuang for more than a month before setting off again in late August.</p>
<h3>Dozens of Beggars in Kunming Become Guests at an Ice Cream Parlor, a Bad Joke Caused by Arrogant Service</h3>

Mr. Shi, in anger, hired dozens of beggars and brought them into the shop to feast on ice cream. The diners were in an uproar and rushed out. Tables and chairs inside the shop were in disarray, and cups and dishes were a mess. A large number of police officers were dispatched to suppress the situation, which was serious. Later, several military officers joined in to cheer on the beggars, almost leading to trouble. Fortunately, through persuasion, the shop owner apologized and the matter was settled.</p>

<h3>Britain Decides to Maintain a Neutral Stance on Palestine, Definite Date of Withdrawal from the Holy Land to Be Announced on Thursday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London Broadcast of the 1st: Sources at the British Foreign Office said today that Britain will defend the borders of Palestine to prevent illegal Jewish immigrants and Arabs from entering until it relinquishes its mandate next year. The date of handing over the mandate will most likely be announced by Cadogan at the United Nations on Wednesday or Thursday. It is generally believed that the mandate will end in January or February, but political circles believe it should be one to three months later. A Foreign Office spokesman denied that the mandate would end on May 1st.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Dispatch of the 1st] Sir Alexander Cadogan, the chief representative of the British mission to the United Nations, declared today: "I am scheduled to announce on Thursday the definite date of Britain's withdrawal from Palestine. The British Cabinet is currently debating the resolution on the partition of Palestine passed by the General Assembly, and the decision will be communicated to me within 24 hours. I will then formally announce the British government's position to the United Nations organization before Thursday. As far as I know, the withdrawal is scheduled to begin early next month, or about four weeks from now, and there may be no British soldier in Palestine before June 1948." Cadogan also reiterated that the destination of the British troops' withdrawal is Britain itself, not Jordan. He also reaffirmed that Britain will maintain its neutral stance on Palestine, asserting that Britain will not "lift a finger" to implement the partition plan, and that Britain will simply withdraw completely from Palestine. As for how to establish the new countries in the region, that is the business of the United Nations organization. When asked whether Britain would conclude a treaty with the new Jewish state, he replied "of course."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, Dispatch of the 31st] The partition plan voted on by the United Nations General Assembly last night divides Palestine into three areas: one part is designated as a Jewish state, one part is designated as an Arab state, and a small part near the center, including Jerusalem and Bethlehem, is designated as an international zone. Geographically, Palestine is shaped like a scimitar, with the tip of the blade pointing eastward. The southern part, which occupies about one-third of the entire territory and borders Egypt, will see the Jews gaining most of the inland areas, while the Arabs will gain a narrow strip of land along the coast. The central part of Palestine faces the Dead Sea and the Jordan River in the east, and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. The Jews will gain a narrow coastal strip, including the city of Tel Aviv and the port of Haifa. The Arabs will gain the other parts and the port of Jaffa. In the north, the Jews will gain a narrow strip of land in the east, along the Sea of Tiberias to the Lebanese border, the so-called Galilee in the New Testament. The Arabs will gain the northernmost land, including Nazareth, the birthplace of Jesus.</p>
<h3>Arab People Are Roused to Anger, Tensions Rise in the Middle East, Three-Day General Strike Protests Partition</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, Dispatch of the 1st] The Arab Higher Executive Committee today called on the Arabs of the Holy Land to implement a three-day general strike starting tomorrow to protest the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the partition of Palestine. The committee also demanded that the Arabs step up their boycott of Jewish goods, and that anyone who trades with Jews be considered a traitor. At the same time, the level of riots in the Middle East is intensifying. People in Damascus, Syria, marched in demonstrations and set fire to the U.S. embassy. Clashes also occurred in Palestine, with many Jewish casualties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, Dispatch of the 30th] After the news of the UN's passage of the Palestine partition plan spread to the Middle East, the entire Middle East entered a state of tension. It is reported that ten Jews have already been killed in Palestine. The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, in Cairo, stated that the partition resolution will ignite the fire in the Near East. Lebanese Prime Minister Solh said in a statement in Baghdad that the Arab League has established a secret decision-making body, and that the Syrian and Lebanese armies are on standby. Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr declared at a press conference in Baghdad that the responsibility of the Arabs lies in saving Palestine. The Arab Committee for the Defense of Palestine, after holding a secret meeting for four hours, stated that now is the time for action, not talk. In Palestine, British troops in Jerusalem have been ordered to remain in their barracks and not go out to prevent incidents. Jews in Tel Aviv, on the other hand, were celebrating wildly. The Irgun, a Jewish underground organization, spoke from its secret radio station in Tel Aviv, declaring that the Irgun would cease to exist within the Jewish state, but also said, "The partition is illegal, and the signature of the Jewish Agency representatives cannot bind the Jewish people. The war to liberate all of Palestine will continue." The Iraqi cabinet met for three hours today, mainly to discuss the immediate implementation of the resolution decided by the Arab League in Bode on 1946, which is said to include a plan for the mass immigration of Arabs into Palestine. At the same time, it is reported that the Lebanese Prime Minister and other leaders were meeting all day in Baghdad with Iraqi leaders, and the telephone lines between Baghdad and Cairo were also very busy. Egyptian students held strikes and other demonstrations, and more than a thousand students from Farouk University in Alexandria sent a telegram to the Arab Higher Executive Committee, expressing their willingness to shed blood for Palestine.</p>
<h3>The Arab Delegation Issues a Solemn Declaration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Dispatch of the 30th] After the UN General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan, the Arab delegation to the United Nations held a meeting on its own. Afterwards, it issued a statement, stating briefly that the Arab delegation has repeatedly denied that the United Nations General Assembly or any other organization has the right to partition Palestine. They believe that the partition of Palestine case passed by the UN majority has exceeded the power conferred on members of the United Nations by the charter. The Arab delegation solemnly declares that the vote on the case was produced under duress and of course cannot be considered valid.</p>
<h3>We Are Deeply Concerned About the Future Situation in the Middle East</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, Dispatch of the 1st] A certain government official stated today that the National Government is deeply concerned about the future of the Jewish state established by the United Nations General Assembly. Although China sympathizes with the Jews, it announced its abstention when voting on the partition of the Holy Land, because it felt that this plan would cause new riots in the Middle East.</p>
<h3>The Queen of the Netherlands Resumes State Affairs</h3>
<p>[United Nations, The Hague, Dispatch of the 1st] Queen Wilhelmina resumed her political affairs today after a six-week recess.</p>
<h3>Unstable Situation in Italy, Prime Minister Asks U.S. Troops to Stay Temporarily, 20,000 Communists Hold Armed Demonstration</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, Dispatch of the 1st] Government sources revealed on the 1st that due to the instability of the situation in Italy, the United States has decided to keep its troops stationed until the latest hour allowed by the Italian peace treaty. This news coincides with the arrival of the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet in Naples. Observers generally believe that due to the serious threat of communist action, Prime Minister De Gasperi has requested that U.S. troops remain until December 14, the final deadline stipulated in the treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, Dispatch of the 30th] Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti published an article in the party newspaper warning the government that any attempt to ban the Communist Party may lead to civil war. At the same time, 20,000 Italian Communist Party members held a military review in Genoa today, which further underscored the significance of Togliatti's warning. The review was presided over by Communist Party Deputy Leader Longo. Labor organizations under Communist Party control in Liguria and other places in northern Italy went on strike to support the armed demonstration in Genoa. In some areas of Rome, non-communist newspapers and factories were looted and destroyed by rioters. Political observers believe that the military demonstration by Communist Party members may immediately accelerate the destructive actions of the Communist Party in various places.</p>
<h3>Molotov Declines Marshall's Invitation to Dinner</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, Dispatch of the 30th] It was learned tonight that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, citing a prior engagement, declined Marshall's invitation to dinner on the 1st. Observers here believe that the significance of Molotov's response may be greater than it appears on the surface. They believe that Molotov's refusal to attend the dinner indicates that Molotov is not yet ready to bargain on the German issue.</p>
<h3>Britain Has No Intention of Suppressing the Activities of the Fascist League</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, Dispatch of the 30th] British Home Secretary Ede declared that the British government has no intention of suppressing the activities of Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Fascist League, and his allies.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Enters Its Second Week, the U.S. Plans to Issue a Statement on the German Plan, the Final Obstacles to the Austrian Treaty Have Not Been Removed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London Broadcast of the 1st: The Foreign Ministers' Conference entered its second week today. Before the start of the conference, French Foreign Minister Bidault told reporters that if the Foreign Ministers' Conference cannot reach an agreement on the future of Germany, then the French-occupied zone of Germany may be merged with the British and American-occupied zones to form a Western United Germany. In addition, according to sources, the Soviet Union has rejected the French proposal for the disposal of German assets in Austria, which is the last obstacle to completing the Austrian treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, Dispatch of the 30th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference entered its second week today. The French delegation called on Britain and the United States to strengthen control of the Ruhr area in order to diplomatically offset the Soviet Union's position in eastern Germany.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, United Press Dispatch of the 30th] Marshall plans to issue a most comprehensive statement on the German issue at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in the next few days, which will include opinions on German economic unification and the establishment of a national provisional government. It is believed that Marshall's statement will reiterate the American foreign policy that he briefly outlined at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. He will call for the elimination of obstacles that separate the occupied zones, for Germany to achieve economic unification as soon as possible, and then for the organization of a German central government. It is reported that the reason for the delay in Marshall's statement is that the U.S. delegation is divided on the Ruhr industrial area. One faction, led by Dulles, advocates international co-management of the Ruhr, while the other faction, led by Clay, believes that Germans should be allowed to participate in the control of the Ruhr under Allied supervision. This can preserve the prevention of the revival of militarism in all of Germany. According to unconfirmed reports, Marshall seems to agree with Clay's opinion. If so, all of America's foreign policy will change.</p>
<h3>A Draft Resolution from the International Socialist Party Calls on the Four Foreign Ministers to Avoid Splitting Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Antwerp, Dispatch of the 30th] The Political Committee of the International Socialist Party Conference recently unanimously passed a draft resolution calling on the four foreign ministers in London to avoid, at all costs, splitting Germany into east and west, so as not to cause a split in Europe and even the world. The resolution also advocated restoring Austria's sovereignty as soon as possible and ending the occupation of the country.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Senate May Pass Aid Bills to France, Italy, and Austria, the House May Include Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, Dispatch of the 30th] The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote on the $597 million aid bill to France, Italy, and Austria on the 1st. Republican leaders, in addition to launching attacks on Marshall's long-term plan, now all indications are that they will allow the bill to pass. The majority of senators on the Senate committee are now working to restore the $108 million that was attempted to be cut from the aid fund to the three countries. According to informed sources here, although it is not yet known whether the $60 million recommended by the House Foreign Affairs Committee will be changed, the House may pass a resolution to include aid to China in the interim aid bill.</p>
<p>If the original text of the House bill is passed as it is currently drafted, then the House and Senate must convene a joint conference to resolve their differences of opinion. However, it is very likely that the bill will be amended and passed by the Senate, because Congressman Mundt recently stated that the House Foreign Affairs Committee inserted the aid to China case in the bill in order to allow Marshall to use the fund for China if he deems it necessary. However, Mundt said that if the State Department decides that this fund cannot be given to China, then it can be freely used for Europe. Although the two houses seem to be able to take final action on the emergency aid bill this week, what most people are concerned about is still Marshall's long-term plan.</p>
<h3>The Dutch-Indonesian Political Negotiations Are About to Resume</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, Dispatch of the 1st] The U.S. transport ship "Renville," which was provided to the Netherlands and Indonesia for political negotiations, will arrive off the coast of Indonesia tomorrow. The negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia, which were interrupted in April, are expected to resume on the ship. The Chairman of the Security Council's Commission of Good Offices, Frank Graham, has issued an appeal to the governments and people of the Netherlands and Indonesia, requesting their sincere cooperation in order to quickly resolve the dispute, which has "strategic significance" in terms of time and space.</p>
<h3>Eleanor Roosevelt Arrives in Geneva</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, Dispatch of the 30th] Mrs. Roosevelt, who is going to Geneva to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights meeting, is scheduled to fly directly from Shannon Airport in Ireland to Geneva today.</p>
<h3>The U.S. State Department Issues a Draft Declaration of Human Rights, Guaranteeing Fundamental Human Freedoms</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, Dispatch of the 1st] The U.S. State Department announced that Mrs. Roosevelt, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, will submit a proposal to the committee, calling on all countries in the world to grant their people extensive freedom of work in the area of human rights, as well as new concepts such as health and social security, as well as the traditional American freedoms of speech, religion, petition, assembly, etc., and the safety of those accused of crimes. The State Department's press release stated, "Although everyone in the world cannot immediately obtain all of these rights, in principle these are the basic rights that everyone should have." Freedom of movement has been opposed by the Soviet Union. When the Geneva Sub-Commission on Racial Discrimination and Minorities voted that freedom of movement should be included in basic human rights, the Soviet Union stated that in the past, capitalist countries mostly used immigration to obtain labor to be exploited.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Concluding Review: Widespread Belief in Expanded US-Soviet Rift</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 30th] Many UN representatives believe that the recently concluded session of the United Nations General Assembly, while one of the most successful in the UN's history, has also established new areas of dispute. The main achievements of the session include: the establishment of the Balkan Committee to observe the Greek border; the establishment of the Korean Committee to supervise the democratic elections in Korea; the establishment of the "Small Six Committee" to discuss issues that may hinder world peace; and the establishment of the Palestine Committee to supervise the establishment of Jewish and Arab independent states. However, the Soviet and Eastern European bloc countries announced their rejection of the Small Assembly, the Balkan Committee, and the Korean Committee. Therefore, the biggest positive achievement of this General Assembly session is only the decision on the partition of Palestine. However, some representatives believe that there was suspicion of prior consultation during the vote on the plan, which does not increase confidence in the UN organization. Now that the Soviet Union has announced its rejection of the Small Assembly and other organizations, and the Arab countries have announced their rejection of the Palestine Committee, senior UN officials admit that this session of the General Assembly not only failed to bring the United States and the Soviet Union closer, but instead widened the rift.</p>
<h3>French Labor Unrest Escalates: Paris Water, Electricity, and Gas Supply Interrupted; Parliament Postpones Discussion of Emergency Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 1st Broadcast: Paris report, The Labor Confederation, controlled by the Communist Party, issued a statement today declaring that if the Schumann Emergency Powers Bill becomes law in Parliament, the Confederation will never negotiate with the government to resolve the French labor unrest. However, only Communist Party members signed the statement, and other members did not sign, indicating that the labor sector itself has already split.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 1st] As the French National Assembly convened on the 1st to discuss the remaining parts of Prime Minister Schumann's emergency measures plan, Paris's water, electricity, and gas supply were disrupted again due to new strikes, and underground transportation was also in danger of being suspended. Schumann's bill is almost entirely aimed at preventing the Communist Party from controlling trade unions and using strikes as political weapons. It stipulates that those who obstruct workers from going to work will be sentenced to six months to five years in prison and heavy fines. The penalties for sabotage, armed destruction, and attacks on non-striking workers are doubled, and Communist Party newspapers will also be subject to actual control.</p>
<p>The decision-making bureau of the Labor Confederation under Communist Party control is also scheduled to meet today to finally decide whether to yield to Schumann and order the two million strikers to return to work. Some splits seem to have appeared in the Communist labor front, but it is too early to say that this will lead to a betrayal of the Communist Party leadership. Paris underground transportation workers completely stopped working at noon on the 1st. Although buses are still running normally, they cannot cope with the daily flow of four million passengers on the subway. Although the gas workers are on strike, 85 percent of Paris's electricity is supplied by power plants in the provinces, so Paris will not become a completely dark city, but the electricity consumption for industrial use will be sharply reduced.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] The National Assembly has postponed discussions on the government's anti-strike law. Labor Minister Mayer has negotiated with representatives of the National Confederation of Labor Unions to resolve the labor unrest. At the same time, the government's standing committee has mobilized more troops and police to stand by. Before deciding to postpone the debate, the National Assembly rejected several amendments proposed by the Communist Party to delay the passage of the anti-strike law by a vote of 397 to 144. Then, by a vote of 404 to 184, it passed the first clause of the bill, which authorizes the mobilization of 80,000 reservists to supplement security forces. French Communist leader Thorez returned to Paris from Moscow yesterday. When he entered the National Assembly, Communist Party members cheered him.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Incidents of damaging railways in France are endless. On the Geneva-Paris line and the Versailles-Chartres line, damaged railway lines were discovered over the weekend. Fortunately, they were discovered early and no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Eastern European Federation Plan: Realization Possible Sooner or Later; Nine-Nation Communist Information Bureau to Meet</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Sofia, 30th] The evening newspaper "Bulgarian Capital" reported that Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov recently discussed the plan to organize a federation of Eastern European communist countries with Marshal Stalin in Sochi, Georgia, Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 30th] Responsible officials here stated that they knew nothing about the claim in the London Sunday newspaper that Stalin and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov discussed the organization of an Eastern European Federation during their recent meeting. One Yugoslav official even dismissed it as baseless talk. However, no one here denied the possibility of organizing an Eastern European Federation sooner or later, but well-informed people do not believe that this federation can be realized in the near future. It is recalled that when Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito visited Bulgaria, he mentioned the possibility of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria forming a confederation, but said that it was not planned to organize such a union at present. However, he also said that his and Dimitrov's pleasant conversation had laid the foundation for the formation of a federation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 3rd] Well-informed sources claim that representatives of the first meeting of the Communist Information Bureau of nine countries will gather in Belgrade within days, but the exact date of the meeting is still unknown. It is reported that the Italian Communist Party will send two giants, Agriati and Longo, to participate, and the French Communist Party's representatives will be Deputy Secretary-General of the French Communist Party Duclos and Communist Party member Faillon.</p>
<h3>Marshal Auchinleck: Relinquishes Post, Leaves India for Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] Marshal Auchinleck relinquished his position as Supreme Commander of India and Pakistan today and departed for Italy, where he is expected to reside. The British government announced two weeks ago that due to a lack of cooperation between India and Pakistan, Marshal Auchinleck and his staff would withdraw on November 30th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Katayama Accused of Supporting Fascism</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Following former Prime Minister Hiranuma and Minister Nishio, Prime Minister Katayama has also been accused by a person named Tadatsune Minamikawa to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office. The reason is that Katayama published an essay explaining the National Mobilization Law Bill in the March 1937 issue of "Chuo Koron," but failed to record it on the investigation form submitted to the Central Public Office Eligibility Review Committee. The content of the essay was completely supportive of the National Mobilization Law's fascist tone. Minamikawa is a young man who survived the Kaiten special attack force. Since it is the first time that a prime minister has been accused, the prosecution authorities are taking an extremely cautious attitude in handling the case.</p>
<h3>Japanese Transport Minister Tomabechi Resigns</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Katayama's Minister of Transport, Yoshizan Tomabechi, submitted his resignation this morning. It is generally believed that after Yoshizan Tomabechi resigns, he will succeed Giichi Takeda as Secretary-General of the Democratic Party.</p>

<h3>Election Supervisory Committee Begins Nominations; Proceeding According to Schedule Until Further Notice; General Assembly Appoints Ballot Counting and Voting Observers</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The inaugural ceremony of the election meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Supervisory Yuan was held solemnly in the auditorium of the Municipal Council at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and directors of the Civil Affairs and Finance Bureaus, as well as more than 100 municipal councilors, attended. After the ceremony, Election Supervisor Mayor Wu took his seat, followed by Speaker Pan, who delivered a speech stating that the Constitution of the Republic of China would soon be implemented. According to the Constitution, members of the Supervisory Committee should be elected by provincial and municipal councils. Two members have been designated for this city, and the vote is scheduled for December 7th according to procedure. He emphasized that supervisory power is a very important department in the Constitution, and in order to ensure that supervisory power is exercised appropriately and helps improve administrative efficiency, the selection of supervisory committee members must also be appropriate. Before the election of supervisory committee members, the central government entrusted this important task to the public opinion organs of various provinces and cities, which shows how much the National Assembly valued public opinion organs when it formulated the Constitution.</p>
<h3>Seriously Consider: Appropriate Candidates</h3>
<p>Pan metaphorically stated that legislative members are produced in proportion to the population of provinces and cities, which is similar to the form of members of the lower house of the parliament of a country, while supervisory committee members are regulated by administrative regions, with five members produced in each province and two members produced in each city, regardless of population size, which is similar to the establishment of members of the upper house. In short, the election of supervisory committee members is a very solemn matter, so he hoped that all councilors could seriously consider candidates in their minds who could represent the citizens of Shanghai to the central government to exercise supervisory power.</p>
<h3>Election Supervisor Explains Laws</h3>
<p>Election Supervisor Mayor Wu continued to explain the relevant election laws and procedures for the city, stating that:</p>
<p>1.  Any resident of the city who has the right to vote under the law and is 35 years of age or older may be elected as a supervisory committee member. The nomination of candidates shall be co-signed by five or more electors.</p>
<p>2.  Those who have resided in the county or city or equivalent district to which they belong outside their place of origin for more than six months or have a residence for more than one year may be elected as a supervisory committee member in the election district even if their place of origin has not changed.</p>
<p>3.  Incumbent officials who participate in the election do not need to resign in advance.</p>
<p>4.  The election method is to circle one person from the list of candidates using an anonymous ballot. Each councilor can only nominate once.</p>
<p>5.  Only one member from each provincial and municipal council can be elected as a supervisory committee member.</p>
<p>6.  After being elected, the supervisory committee members will be notified separately by the election supervisor. They shall indicate in writing within ten days of receiving the notification whether they are willing to be elected. Those who do not indicate within the time limit shall be deemed to be willing to be elected. If they are unwilling to be elected, the person with the next highest number of votes will be elected.</p>
<h3>Voting and Ballot Counting: Completed on the 7th</h3>
<p>The Speaker also reported that from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day from the 1st to the 4th, councilors will complete the candidate nomination process. At 6:00 p.m. on the 4th, the election supervisor will simultaneously announce the list of candidates at the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council. Voting will take place from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the 7th, and the ballot will be absolutely secret. Ballot counting will be held from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on the 7th. During voting and ballot counting, four observers each will be present to supervise the procedures for councilors to receive and vote ballots and count ballots. The candidates are nominated by the General Assembly to be designated by the Speaker as: Ballot Observers Tong Xingbai, Wang Xianqing, Jiang Huaisu, and Wang Zhuyi; Ballot Counting Observers Xu Yongzuo, Qu Yue, Lao Jingxiu, and Shui Xiangyun. If any of these eight people are nominated as candidates, they will be replaced by others.</p>
<h3>Hu Yang and Chuan Baitao: Most Hopeful for Election</h3>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu added that the city has not yet received an order from the central government to postpone the election of supervisory committee members, so it will still hold a meeting according to law. If the central government orders a postponement, the nomination dates from the 1st to the 4th will not be changed, that is, the nomination will still end on the 4th, and the voting date on the 7th will be postponed. [Another Report] According to inquiries from various councilors by reporters in recent days, most councilors intend to nominate Tao Baichuan as the candidate for the Supervisory Committee, while some intend to nominate Yang Huyu outside the council.</p>

<h3>Toothbrush Industry Workers Strike</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Approximately 100 workers from some toothbrush factories went on strike yesterday. It is understood that the reason was to protest against the party in charge for not complying with the recording. After hearing the news, the Social Bureau sent personnel to mediate, and Xu Mengbiao was responsible for soliciting orders, with the price set at 204,000 yuan per ream. Half of the payment was collected first, and the goods were delivered on [date not provided]. The plaintiff stated that the Central Bookstore needed paper for printing books and was a shareholder. Therefore, it ordered 3,000 reams of paper from the company twice on August 20th and 25th, and paid half of the payment in advance, totaling 300 million yuan. The above payment was personally delivered to the company by Ping, and Zhu personally received it, and Qi signed a contract and issued a receipt as proof. It was unexpectedly found that the goods could not be delivered on time. After repeated urging, it was ineffective. After investigation, it was learned that the newspaper ordered by the company from the Soviet Commercial Counselor had been canceled due to unpaid deposits before the sale, and the Transport Management Committee had never issued any import permits. The half of the payments received from various customers were all used to lure people with a low-priced offer with an invalid order by fraudulent means, causing people to misunderstand and believe. They should be jointly held criminally liable according to the law, and after the first order expired, the defendants knew that they could not deliver the goods. According to the agreement, they settled the price for one part, totaling 359.66 million yuan, and issued two checks from the Xingcheng Bank dated September 23rd, but when they were cashed upon maturity, they were rejected due to overdrafts. After repeated negotiations, only 100 million yuan was repaid. The balance and unsettled costs were ignored, so he filed a complaint requesting that they be punished according to law and ordered to compensate for the loss of 2.696 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>Financial Control Has Achieved Results; All Materials in Shanghai to Be Comprehensively Surveyed</h3>
<p>Commander Xuan compared the urgent measures to firefighting. Xuan Tiewu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, met with a Central News Agency reporter in the afternoon of the 1st to implement the "Economic Suppression of Chaos Urgent Measures" and made a statement, saying that the urgent measures are a "firefighting" effort to quickly clean up the current situation of rampant legal tender and soaring prices. Political power will be used to eradicate various artificial maladies and stabilize finances so that prices can be suppressed. The urgent measures are divided into two aspects: financial control and material control. Currently, the implementation is one part of financial control. This work is the responsibility of the Central Bank. The main measures are tightening credit and checking the account books of banks and merchants, which have achieved remarkable results in recent days, and prices have gradually fallen. However, Xuan believes that it has not yet been "100%" achieved. He hopes that the financial authorities will be determined to "sacrifice a few to complete the majority" at this time of "burning the boat". According to the reporter, the detailed measures for the material control part will be implemented after Zhang Jia'ao, president of the Central Bank, brings back some instructions from the highest authorities in Shanghai. The measures include strict government control of various important materials, and a thorough survey of all daily necessities in Shanghai to crack down on national accumulation. The survey work will be carried out by personnel from various agencies, as well as mobilizing military police and students from the city to participate in the form of household registration checks. A dedicated executive agency will be established jointly, and the agency will be given great power by the authorities.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The case of a large amount of drugs worth approximately 10 billion yuan being smuggled on a China National Aviation Corporation flight from Kunming to Shanghai is currently under investigation at the District Prosecutor's Office. Shi Qi, a key criminal mechanic in the case, was recently arrested in Chongming (see round). He was escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office by the police bureau yesterday.

Prosecutor Quan Tao led a group to Longhua Airport late at night on the 14th of last month to arrest the suspected criminals in the case. Four people were arrested at that time, and another key criminal mechanic, Shi Qi, escaped. When [the prosecutors] went to Lujia Yan near the airport to arrest him, Shi had already fled. Because Shi's original籍貫 (registered permanent residence) was Chongming, the District Prosecutor's Office sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau requesting that personnel be sent to Chongming to arrest him. It also sent a letter to China National Aviation Corporation, requesting that personnel be sent to the Chongming District Prosecutor's Office to face-to-face deliver an official letter to the chief prosecutor, requesting that personnel be dispatched to assist. As a result of cooperation between the two parties, Shi was finally arrested in the eastern head of Qiaozhen in Chongming.

<h3>A List Causes Resentment: Hong Kong-Shanghai New Air Route Inaugural Flight Invites Hong Kong Press for Test Flight</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] According to sources from Hong Kong news circles: The Hong Kong-Shanghai route of the Hong Kong Airlines, organized by British merchants in Hong Kong, is scheduled to officially commence on the 2nd. The company plans to invite Chinese and Western reporters from Hong Kong to accompany the flight for a test flight and to visit various places in Beijing and Shanghai. The list of invited newspapers originally included the Kuomintang Daily, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, and the Hong Kong branch of the Central News Agency. However, when the company issued invitations on November 26, there were only four: the English "South China Morning Post", "Hongkong Telegraph", and the Chinese "Wah Kiu Yat Po" and "Sing Tao Daily". This caused dissatisfaction among the entire Chinese press in Hong Kong. Because the invited "Wah Kiu Yat Po" openly collaborated with the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, and its host, Cen Weixiu, was explicitly wanted by our government. The newspaper has recently defended the communists and slandered our government, so it is still a prohibited illegal newspaper by our government, and the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters has issued an order in the case. Now, the company is formally inviting representatives of this illegal newspaper to enter our country in high spirits, which is not only an insult to the entire Chinese press in Hong Kong, but also a mockery of our government's explicit orders. Therefore, the Hong Kong press plans to jointly telegraph their counterparts in Shanghai to unanimously criticize them and refuse to host the so-called "Hong Kong Reporters Group" to maintain national integrity. What makes the Hong Kong press even more dissatisfied with the company is that it temporarily canceled the invitations of the Kuomintang Daily, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, and the Central News Agency branch, which are either opinion agencies closely related to our government or newspapers that support government policies. This action by Hong Kong Airlines fully demonstrates its unfriendly attitude towards our country, so the Hong Kong press has risen up to criticize it and has requested colleagues in Shanghai not to host this group of reporters who cannot represent the Chinese press in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Syndicate Officially Reopens</h3>

<h3>Striking Pilots: No Hope of Reinstatement: Foreign Ships Entering and Exiting the Port: Normalcy Resumed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The entry and exit of foreign ships in the city has returned to normal. The twenty-two striking pilots have had their licenses revoked by the customs, and it seems that there is no hope of reinstatement. Although the Chinese pilots of the Tongsha Public Association still refuse to work under the control of the customs, they can directly accept the invitation of shipping companies. The number of White Russian pilots temporarily hired by the customs has increased to ten. They are working very hard because each person must bear the burden of the work equivalent to that of two people before. The person in charge of the Customs Pilot Office told reporters yesterday that no ship that should be exported will not be able to export, and no ship that should be imported will not be able to import, so in fact, it has not been affected by the strike. Based on the general situation, it is speculated that there is only one month left until January 1 of next year, when the customs hands over the pilot management rights, and it is possible that the current situation will continue during this period, and there may be other changes after the Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications takes over.</p>

<h3>Statement by the Fuel Control Committee on the Coal Rationing Issue: Profits and Losses All Belong to the National Treasury, With No Profit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a written statement regarding the report that "coal is still insufficient, the industrial community suggests reducing the controlled area, and believes that the profit taken by the Fuel Management Committee in the middle is too much": According to the current method, the price of coal purchased by the committee from various controlled mines is approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, plus various necessary expenses. The selling price of the distribution to various parties in need is also approved by the Ministry. There is absolutely no profit during the period. Taking the main coal source of Kaiyuan as an example, the December price of the coal</p>
<p>(1) Qinhuangdao delivery price is 1,080,000 yuan per ton, (2) Ship costs: (A) Freight 347,000 yuan, (B) Late fee 40,100 yuan, (C) Pilotage and wharf fees 328,000 yuan, (D) Insurance fee 14,000 yuan, (E) Shortage (omission) 45,500 yuan, (3) Shanghai wharf fee (loading and unloading fee) 141,000 yuan, (4) Business fee: (A) Wharf equipment fee 12,000 yuan, (B) Management fee 11,000 yuan, The above cost per ton is approximately 1.73 million yuan, while the price for public utilities, the largest distribution target, is 1.49 million yuan, with a loss of 240,000 yuan per ton. The price for railways and out-of-town power plants is 1.73 million yuan, which is sold at cost. The price for factories and military agencies varies from 1.46 million yuan to 1.66 million yuan due to the different grades of coal required, which is used to compensate for the losses in public utilities. However, because the amount of coal required by public utilities is very large, the profits obtained from the coal used by factories and military agencies are often insufficient, and the previous government's subsidy system for public utilities and railways, and the current distribution of coal balls to public educators, industrial workers, and occupational workers, etc., cause even greater losses. Although the national treasury bears the burden, even if there is a surplus, it is returned to the national treasury, so the profits and losses all belong to the national treasury, and the committee has no profit to speak of. In addition to controlling Kaiyuan, Huainan in East China, and various mines in Taiwan, all domestic coal is allowed for manufacturers to purchase and transport on their own. The committee does not control domestic white coal, and industry and commerce can freely mine and transport it. The biggest reason for the supply of domestic coal falling short of demand is poor transportation. Regarding this point, the committee's efforts in recent months have not been effective, and the impact on the market is severe. To date, there are more than 600,000 tons of coal in the Kaiyuan area, 560,000 tons in Huainan, and 340,000 tons in East China. Even if coal transportation is opened, I am afraid that the industrial community will not be able to transport it. Therefore, improving transportation, especially railway transportation, is the key to solving the coal shortage.</p>

<p>"Zhang Fei Pushing Zhuge Liang" "Heroes" Busy Back and Forth on the Bridge</p>
<p>[Our Report] The "pushcart heroes" who are active on both sides of the bridges along the Suzhou Creek are one of Shanghai's unique social phenomena. They are a profession outside the three hundred and sixty professions that is protected by gangster forces under difficult social living conditions.</p>
<p>Most Shanghai citizens have had contact with "pushcart heroes," and many are disgusted with their bad behavior. These "heroes" often help the rickshaw pullers push their carts to the top of the bridge by means of "forced execution," regardless of whether the passengers agree or not. Some cunning people simply grab the cart handle and pretend to push, but only heaven knows how much effort they actually put in! When the cart reaches the top of the bridge, they ask the passengers for a reward. The current price is 1,000 national currency. Most passengers take out the money out of disgust and annoyance, perhaps thinking it's no different from getting rid of a beggar. If they happen to not have any small bills, or if some strong-willed passengers are unwilling to pay, the "heroes" will insult them with many vicious words, or grab the cart and push it hard down the slope. In this way, even if the cart does not overturn, the passengers will be scared out of their wits.</p>
<h3>Boss Groups Occupy Territory</h3>
<p>Behind these "pushcart heroes" are their systems and territories. Each bridge has one or two old-timer gangster bosses stationed there. We call the pushcart pullers "heroes," but in reality, they are all "minions" under the "bosses." The "bosses" occupy the territory of the bridge, recruit a group of "minions" to do the work of pushing the carts, and collect a fixed daily "tribute" from them. If a "boss" has 20 "minions" under his command, it is estimated that he can earn about 300,000 yuan a day without doing anything himself. Because the benefits are so lucrative, the boundaries between them are very strict. The so-called "river water does not interfere with well water," those on Bridge A cannot push carts on Bridge B, and those on this end of the bridge cannot push carts on the other end of the bridge. Strangers are especially not allowed to intervene. If there are destitute people who don't understand the ways of Shanghai and want to push a cart for some money to buy food, they will be attacked by the group. In this way, before the money for the bread is settled, they will have been beaten enough.</p>
<h3>Gradual Changes in Quality</h3>
<p>People in their circles have a "secret language" for this profession, called "Zhang Fei Pushing Zhuge Liang." They regard the passengers on the cart as Zhuge Liang riding in a Kongming cart. Compared with the beggars and bandits who take money and treat the "customers" as "pigs," their behavior seems much better. As for why they compare themselves to Zhang Fei, perhaps they are influenced by the story of Zhang Fei scaring away Cao Cao's soldiers at Changban Slope in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been some changes in the quality of the "bridgehead heroes." Many refugees who fled to Shanghai from the war zones have joined this camp. When reporters observed the bridgehead yesterday, they found that several pushers did not have the aura of gangsters at all. At a glance, it could be seen that they were peasants who had not left the soil for long. I tried to strike up a conversation with a young man in his twenties, and he actually stood still and listened to me respectfully.</p>
<h3>Can Earn 40,000-50,000 Yuan Per Day</h3>
<p>He told me that he was a refugee who fled from Anhui. After arriving in Shanghai, he first begged in the city, and then met "the boss" (as he called his gangster "boss gang"), who asked him if he was willing to push carts on the bridge. He thought: Isn't this better than "begging for food"! So he started his bridgehead career. Now he can push carts for about 40,000-50,000 yuan a day, of which he has to "pay tribute" to the boss 15,000 yuan. He has a family of four, and his father is also pushing carts on another bridge.</p>
<p>This is a typical farmer who suffered in China's great land. He sincerely accompanied me in the conversation, which took about the time it took to push a cart. He took out 2,000 yuan from his pocket and gave it to him. He thanked me repeatedly for this meager gift, and then ran away with a smile.</p>
<p>For these pushers who were destroyed by the war before falling to the bridgehead, I don't think we should hate them like we hate the other "pushcart heroes"! However, for the sake of appearance, harmony, and safety, we still hope that the municipal authorities can ban them. If it is not that the authorities tacitly approve of them as a legitimate profession and deliberately condone this group of "heroes" active on the bridges, it seems more appropriate to take them into refugee shelters or reformatories as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[United Press Mexico City 30th Dispatch] The second session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is expected to close on Wednesday. Some scientists from various countries have expressed dissatisfaction that the conference's purpose is to seek world peace, but it has failed to adopt a scientific attitude to discuss the issue of peace. Dr. Ge Staysen, the US representative, commented: "Science is not isolated. Science is not for inventing poisonous gas to create new weapons. Science is actually part of the trend of the times. If the trend of the times wants to use new inventions in science as weapons, science is really powerless to do anything about it."</p>

<h3>American Pathologist, Hou Baozhang, to Return to China</h3>
<p>[American News Washington 1st Dispatch] Dr. Hou Baozhang, professor and dean of the Department of Pathology at Cheeloo University in Jinan, will return to China on the General Meigs ship on December 6th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Dr. Hu Xiansu Arrives in Shanghai, Talks About the Miracle of Chinese Metasequoia, Proves the Ancient Eurasia Was Connected</h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News] Dr. Hu Xiansu, a famous Chinese biologist, came to Shanghai last week to raise temporary research funds for the Beiping Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute. According to what he told reporters: The miracle of Metasequoia, which had survived tens of millions of years ago, was discovered near Wanxian. Dr. Hu said: The true Sequoia, or Redwood, has only two surviving trees in the western United States, which are the tallest, largest, and oldest trees in the world. Chinese Metasequoia is a variant of it, discovered by Professor Wan Jun of the Forest Department of Central University and identified by himself. Paleobotanists have previously discovered fossils of this tree on Sakhalin Island, North America, and Europe, which have many similarities with the American Sequoia. Therefore, after the news of the discovery of Chinese Metasequoia in Wanxian spread, the world botanical community regarded it as the most interesting discovery of this century. Dr. R. Chaney, a professor of botany at the University of California, is very concerned about this. The results of his two exchanges with Dr. Hu prove that Metasequoia thrived extensively on both sides of the Pacific Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere in ancient times. The one discovered in Wanxian is 34 meters high and its circumference can be embraced by several people together. The locals regard it as the tree god and worship it, but its true historical interest lies in proving that the ancient Eurasia was originally related, and the relationship between the Chinese and American Metasequoia can further confirm this point. Later, dozens more trees were discovered in Metasequoia Gully in northern Hubei. The three trees produced in Wanxian have excellent wood quality. The Institute of Biology is currently collecting tree species and will widely plant them and exchange them with foreign countries. This tree is an extremely beautiful ornamental plant.</p>

<h3>Liao Education Director Bian Zongmeng Talks About Secondary Education in Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Pan Yang 1st Dispatch] Bian Zongmeng, Director of the Education Department of Liaoning Province, said that the current situation of secondary education in Northeast China is that the students in Northeast China have been ravaged by the enemy puppets for fourteen years, and their level is very low. In the past two years, through the arduous rescue of the education community, they have achieved significant results, and they have a correct understanding of the country and the nation, and their ambition to learn is also very high. Although the school buildings are still dilapidated, they are much improved compared to the ruined ruins when they were taken over.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Unified Review Committee: Yesterday's Standing Committee Decided that Application Forms Already Submitted by Various Schools are Limited to Submission of Various Rosters within Ten Days</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee held its third standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the conference room of this newspaper. The meeting was chaired by Vice Chairman Mr. Pan Gongzhan. The main points of the report were as follows:</p>
<p>The total amount pledged by various donor groups and organizations was 5,200,712,000 yuan, and the amount of scholarships already issued was 3,333,962,000 yuan. The number of students in colleges and universities who received scholarships this semester was 3,054, and the amount of scholarships already issued was 2,846,000,000 yuan. The number of students in public and private secondary schools who received scholarships this semester was 2,288, and the amount of scholarships already issued was 788,885,000 yuan. Due to the fact that various schools have already submitted application forms but have not submitted the roster of students on public funds or tuition waivers for this semester in accordance with the regulations, the scholarships that should have been issued but have not been issued amount to 462,220,000 yuan. The number of students in private primary schools who received scholarships this semester was 1,336, and the amount of scholarships already issued was 400,090,000 yuan. Due to the fact that various schools have already submitted application forms but have not submitted the roster of students on public funds or tuition waivers for this semester in accordance with the regulations, the scholarships that should have been issued but have not been issued amount to 26,650,000 yuan. After discussion, the following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>The municipal government will issue scholarships worth 700 million yuan, which the committee will try its best to raise funds to cover. If the funds raised are insufficient, the municipal government is requested to approve the change of the advance payment to a donation.</p>
<p>Since the Youth Corps and the Youth Association have already handled the pledged funds themselves, they should be requested to submit the roster of scholarship recipients to the committee for verification.</p>
<p>The scholarships that should have been issued but have not been issued for this semester should be issued immediately after receiving the donations from Mr. Mei Guohua and Mr. Zhou Xinfang. The remaining amount should be combined with the remaining funds from the former Student Loan Committee for Poor Students and included in the accounts of this committee for distribution.</p>
<p>Secondary and primary schools that have already submitted application forms but have not submitted the roster of students on public funds or tuition waivers for this semester should be requested to submit the roster to the committee before the 10th of this month. Otherwise, the application forms of their students will not be reviewed.</p>
<p>The roster of scholarship recipients for this semester will be temporarily postponed for printing, and a statistical table will be printed and distributed first.</p>
<p>It is decided to convene a joint celebration meeting for all college and university scholarship recipients at 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month at the Municipal Stadium. The Municipal Bureau of Education, the Municipal Stadium, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Da Gong Bao, the Municipal Cultural and Sports Committee, and this committee are requested to be responsible for the preparation. All standing committee members of this committee are requested to serve on the presidium.</p>
<p>Please ask Xinwen Bao to slightly modify the student aid methods.</p>
<p>Since the public-funded treatment of students at the Taxation Vocational School has been certified by letters from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education as being the same as that of other national vocational schools, their scholarships will still be approved and issued.</p>
<p>The application for scholarships from the New China College of Law and Commerce for this semester was overdue for too long, and it is difficult to approve and issue them. Please have them apply again next semester.</p>
<p>After the issuance of scholarships for this semester is completed, the committee should request an accountant to audit the accounts and announce the audit results to the public to show prudence. The list of schools that have not submitted the roster is as follows:</p>
<p>Secondary School Section: Qingxin, City West, Yucai, Minli Girls' High School, Weiqing, Jiaotong, Guangcheng, Yaolian, Lixing, Youth Association, Xingwu, Hujiang Girls' High School, Qiude Girls' High School, Chongde Girls' High School, Mingde Girls' High School, Xinmin, Zhongguang, Xingzhong, Boren, Wenhua, Jinye Vocational High School, Zhongguo, Gaohang Vocational High School, Senior Mechanical, Senior Obstetrics, Chengyi, Hongsha, Fenghua, Jianghuai, Zhirenyong Girls' High School, Ci, Lequn, St. John's Affiliated High School, Daren, Jingde, Guangshi, Shandao Girls' High School, Zhongzheng, etc.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Education Society to be Established on Schedule</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] More than 30 old members of the Chinese Education Society have registered in Shanghai. The preparatory committee of the Shanghai branch of the society held a meeting at the Zhonghua Book Company the day before yesterday. More than 10 people, including Zhang Yi, Ou Yuanhuai, and Shu Xincheng, attended. It was decided that the inaugural meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month at 404 Yuguo Road.</p>
<h3>This Week's Group A Soccer: Railway Meets White Eagle, Qingbai Meets Jewish on Sunday at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>The third soccer league will continue this week. The soccer committee issued Notification No. 8 last night, announcing that except for Saturday, when there will be no games, on Sunday, starting at 9:00 AM, there will be a total of 14 games in Groups A, B, and C, held at Yiyuan and Zhongzheng Stadiums respectively. The two Group A games will both be held at Yiyuan. At 10:00 AM, Qingbaibai meets Jewish, and starting at 2:30 PM, Railway meets White Eagle.</p>
<p>In the game between Qingbaibai and Jewish, the former is a newly promoted team from Group B. In the friendly match with the strong foreign team White Eagle earlier last month, they fully demonstrated their power. This is their first appearance in Group A, and they should have an even more exciting performance. Jewish has always been known as a dark horse. They easily defeated the Kang team 8-3 in their first battle last week, and their momentum is strong. When they compete with Qingbaibai, in addition to the small yellow-haired Robert Stoff, who is determined to play, the iron gate McNitty also hopes to rush back from Tianjin to participate. The tension is naturally expected.</p>
<p>In the game between Railway and White Eagle, Railway was the champion of the previous Junior Cup, and their strength is evident. However, since Gao Baozhi, Li Yao, Fei Chunhua, Zhang Linggen, Zhang Banglun, and others resigned and left the team, there is no doubt that it will be affected. Although they lost 4-6 to the Malayan Chinese team last month, they also inflicted heavy damage on the visiting team. This time, against the White Eagle, they will definitely try to excel. The full schedule for this week is as follows:</p>
<p>7th (Sunday)</p>
<p>Qingbaibai -- Jewish (Group A) 10:00 AM Yiyuan</p>
<p>Railway -- White Eagle (Group A) 2:30 PM Yiyuan</p>
<p>Gonghexing -- Yangzi (Group C4) 9:00 AM Zhong 1</p>
<p>Huafangji -- Bo Team (Group C1) 9:00 AM Zhong 2</p>
<p>Ji Team -- City Printing (Group C1) 9:00 AM Zhong 3</p>
<p>Railway -- China Airlines (Group B2) 10:30 AM Zhong 1</p>
<p>Kang -- Zhenru (Group B1) 10:30 AM Zhong 2</p>
<p>Beihua -- Silt River (Group C3) 10:30 AM Zhong 3</p>
<p>Far East -- Hongda (Group C2) 1:00 PM Zhong 1</p>
<p>Junior -- Xinshenghe (Group C2) 1:00 PM Zhong 2</p>
<p>Sheng -- Team (Group B1) 2:30 PM Zhong 1</p>
<p>Paramount Jingwu (Group B2) 2:30 PM Zhong 2</p>
<p>Lisen -- Baoxing (Group C4) 2:30 PM Zhong 2</p>

The Shantou team has famous players such as Cai Yanxiong, Ma Canxi, Chen Jijiang, Lin Weizhou, and He Lide, and their lineup is strong. There will be a fierce competition with the foreign generals.</p>
<h3>College Soccer Tournament: Fazen Loses to Tax School, Another Four College Teams Win</h3>

In the second half, Xiao Jing scored twice, and Shi Jingcheng followed suit. In the end, Fazen was defeated by Tax School 4-0. Hopes are extremely strong for that rough championship. The results of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>Daxia wins Jinan (University) 3-0</p>
<p>Fazen wins Tax School (Vocational School) 4-0</p>

<h3>Grand Occasion of the Lianghuai Autumn Games: Huaihai Men and Women Youth Excited and Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent in Huaiyin] The sports scene in northern Jiangsu has always been backward, not to mention that it has gone through ten years of chaos. We stand on this point of view to look at this Lianghuai Autumn Games, which caused a sensation in the Huaihai area. In today's northern Jiangsu, where the rebellion has not been quelled and the flames of war are everywhere, we feel that it is of profound significance.</p>
<p>As early as this summer, when the Huaihai Pacification Zone Headquarters was organizing the "Youth Summer Camp," Commander Zhang Xuezhong began to have the motivation to hold a sports meeting. After several months of preparation, this meaningful program was inaugurated on the birthday of the Premier, under the bright sunshine, and amidst the cheers of thousands of Huaihai youth.</p>
<p>First of all, we should understand that under the restrictions of various conditions, we do not need to place too high hopes on the results of various events. However, what we should pay attention to is the enthusiastic mood of the various athletes. Many athletes from the counties rushed to participate despite the difficulties and dangers of unsafe transportation.</p>
<p>In the conference, we can find many excellent athletes. From them, we can prove that the sports world in northern Jiangsu still has its future. There is a fifteen-year-old student in Huaiyin County. He is a mixed race of Chinese and French. He participated in the pole vault. Although he was ranked second due to lack of physical strength, his posture, his correct and relaxed movements, were unmatched by any other athlete. In addition, Miss Zhao Li of Jiangsu Provincial Huai'an Middle School and Miss Cui Yang of Zhicheng Girls' School in Zhunyin monopolized most of the championships in the girls' group in high jump, long jump, softball, discus... and other track and field events, and became the focus of attention of the entire venue.</p>
<p>The conference lasted for four days. Watched by thousands of pairs of eyes, it closed on the 14th. The cheers and jumps of the youth for four days have already solidified the hearts of thousands of athletes in Huaihai.</p>

<h3>Economic Suppression Measures to be Implemented Soon: Commodity Prices in this City Generally Decline: Rumor that Cadres will be Assigned to Establish Control Institutions</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] In recent days, there have been frequent rumors that the central authorities will implement urgent measures to suppress economic chaos within the year and will set up institutions to control finance and materials in this city, so that commodity prices can be regulated for a long time. As a result of the rumors, commodity prices in this city generally began to fall this morning, resulting in a drop of about 10% compared to the end of last week. In the afternoon, due to the easing of monetary policy, there was a slight recovery.</p>
<p>In terms of Hua shares, each share once fell to the daily limit in the morning. Yongsao once fell to 322 yuan. In the afternoon, it recovered to 362 yuan. Twenty-one Zhibian Mazis fell from 31.3 million yuan to 27.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, it recovered by more than one million yuan. Forty-two blue shares fell from 50.5 million yuan to 46 million yuan, and recovered by about two million yuan in the afternoon. Various grades of cotton fell by about 10%. White japonica rice fell by 30,000 yuan. Flour fell by 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. Crude oil and soybean oil also fell by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Other items such as cigarettes, soap, and candles also generally fell by 10%.</p>
<p>General observations are that if the authorities can issue urgent measures to suppress economic chaos and set up control institutions, assign cadres, and thoroughly implement the responsibilities, and cooperate with the national banking bureau's loan release and monetary policy contraction policies, commodity prices are expected to no longer fluctuate within the year.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Since the news that the government will implement urgent measures to suppress economic chaos in Shanghai and set up economic suppression institutions has been revealed, stock commodity prices showed an overall decline yesterday (1st). A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the person in charge of the national bank to inquire about the situation. According to the person, the bank has not yet received any orders for the above plan. As for setting up another institution, it is still unknown. President Zhang is still in Beijing on official business and there is no news of leaving Beijing tonight. Once Zhang returns to Shanghai, the content will be clear. The person in charge analyzed the past price surge and the internal factors of the current decline, saying that the recent price fluctuations were mainly caused by the rise in gold, banknotes, yarn, and cloth. This decline was also caused by the sharp drop in these items. According to the survey, the market price of gold and banknotes fell by about 10% on the 1st, which is about 30% lower than the peak; the Yarn and Cloth Association announced that it would decide to implement a joint distribution system in the shortest possible time, and the association entrusted the Textile Construction Company to sell as much as possible on the market in order to adapt to the urgent measures. Market prices also fell by more than 10%, which is 20% lower than the peak. Furthermore, according to past gold and banknote transactions, actual transactions were rare, and the supply and demand were uneven, creating an abnormal psychological effect. This decline is a natural trend of psychological circulation. Shanghai is a speculative market, and people's hearts are fluctuating. This can be used as a head-on blow to speculators. In addition, measures such as the National Banking Bureau and provincial and municipal banks stopping loans, and restrictions on remittances coming to Shanghai from various places are all effective measures to tighten monetary policy. Furthermore, the National Bank is still continuing to inspect bank holdings. Regarding the clause that bills cannot be used on the same day, before the new method is promulgated, the National Bank will strictly implement the previous order of the Ministry of Finance, and they must not be used on the same day. Tightening monetary policy has already had an effect on suppressing prices, and the National Bank will continue to carry out the policy on the 2nd. The person in charge expressed absolute optimism about the future stability of commodity prices. He continued to say that in the future, the handling of materials brought to port with self-provided foreign exchange, the successive arrival of Sino-American relief materials, and the success of American loans, the government's control of a large number of materials, and various factors will all be beneficial to the future of commodity prices. It will not be difficult to clear up the shadow of speculation.</p>
<h3>People are Extremely Panicked, Hua Shares Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's shares changed quite a bit. Initially, people were extremely uneasy and fell sharply in the middle of the day. Yongsao, Meiya, and Xinhuo fell to the limit. Powerful groups took advantage of the low prices to supplement their positions outside the market, and the National Bank stepped in again, and then rebounded sharply after falling.</p>
<p>Initially, the announcement of the emergency plan to suppress economic chaos and the news that Chiang Ching-kuo would come to Shanghai to take charge suffered a head-on blow. Yongsao opened low to 365 yuan and 370 yuan. No. 179 delivered in stages, No. 32 sold off, and No. 16 immediately delivered, gradually decreasing from 365 yuan and 372 yuan. China Mud fell to the daily limit and retreated to 247 yuan and 251 yuan. Outside the market, the interest rate opened low to 2.25 cents and 2.7 cents, and then leveled off slightly. No. 67 immediately delivered, and No. 91 took advantage of the low prices to absorb and deliver in stages, once rebounding to 350 yuan and 357 yuan. No. 220 and others sold off in stages and delivered immediately. Financial aid was not easy, and everyone was panicked. Meiya separately hung a limit order by No. 219 and others, and Yongsao also announced that it would fall to the limit at 11:30, and the current delivery would fall to the limit. No. 54 and others maintained it at low prices, and No. 117 and others immediately delivered. It rebounded to 330 yuan and 338 yuan near the closing. No. 98 sold off immediately, and No. 173 and others delivered in stages. The afternoon close still retreated to 328 yuan and 333 yuan. The spot delivery Xinhuo also fell to the limit and then recovered slightly. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the spot delivery shares Yongsao, Meiya, and Xinhuo fell to the limit and then recovered, and Huaxin, Zhongfang, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Zhongsi, Match, Wuhe, Yonggong Underwear, and Xinhua each fell by about 10%. China Mud fell to the limit, Jingfu, China-France, Huadian, and Xinguang each fell by 1.5%, and Zhabei Jinghui Datong fell by 0.5%. The deferred delivery shares included Yongsao, Meiya, and Xinhuo, which fell to the limit and then recovered, and Huafeng and Qinxing, which fell by about 10%. Xinguang Jingfu fell by 1.5%.</p>
<p>The market was still weak, and Meiya was placed on hold by No. 27. No. 223 and others sold for deferred delivery, and No. 226 and others sold for immediate delivery. Yongsao also announced that it would fall to the limit. The difference between the current delivery and the deferred delivery was too great, and there were many arbitrageurs, and the deferred delivery was even traded at 332 yuan, which was lower than the limit. No. 155 and others scrambled to make up for immediate delivery, and No. 65 and others immediately delivered. At first, it was rumored that the National Bank was only short of more than 10 billion and rose to 344 yuan and 353 yuan, and No. 84 and others sold immediately, and No. 160 and others sold for deferred delivery, falling to 340 yuan and 355 yuan. The National Bank issued 17 billion, No. 4 and others immediately rebounded, and then there was a rebound. It was rumored outside the market that the Beijing gang was buying 700 million shares, and people's hearts were greatly improved, and the price rose to a high price of 358 yuan and 365 yuan. No. 32 and others still sold at high prices, and the closing price was 356 yuan and 360 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning close, the spot delivery shares Xinguang and Jingfu rose by 10%, and Huaxin, Yongsao, Rongfeng, Xinhuo, Tongyi, Zhongsi, Huafeng, and China-France rose by 0.5%, and the rest rose slightly. Among the deferred delivery shares, Huafeng rose slightly, and Yongsao, Xinhuo, Meiya, and Qinxing rose by slightly more than 0.5%. Xinguang and Jingfu rose by slightly less than 10%. The old shares outside the market all fell back.</p>
<p>The capital increase of Lian An Department Store has been completed, and the new shares are scheduled to be listed before the market opens on Thursday, December 4th. The transaction unit is temporarily set at 100,000 shares.</p>
<h3>Rice Continues to Decline, Coarse Grains and Oil Market Weakens Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of about 31,000 piculs of rice and grains arrived in the north and south markets. Due to the decline in all commodities, the source of arrival was strong, and the digestion was weak, the market situation continued to decline. Japonica rice continued to fall by 120,000 yuan, indica rice fell by more than 10,000 yuan, and white yuan middle grade also fell by 120,000 yuan. Under the cloud of flour volatility, it continued to fall by more than 10,000 yuan, and bran was also less favored, falling by more than 10,000 yuan. The soybean cake was slightly moved by the guest gang, the cargo owners urgently sold, and it fell sharply by 20,000 yuan. Lu cargo sold inland fell sharply by 30,000 yuan. Yellow beans were quietly used and continued to fall by 230,000 yuan, and the oil mill was still. Tea beans were rarely asked about, red beans were unattended, cowpeas were scarce, and broad beans were also slow to move and turned down by 120,000 yuan. Corn was discontinued in the north and fell miserably by 890,000 yuan. Red sorghum fell again by 120,000 yuan, and raw peanuts were pale and fell sharply by 670,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market took a sharp turn for the worse. In the midst of a sell-off, crude oil fell sharply by more than 200,000 yuan, soybean oil fell sharply by 200,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil fell wildly by 178,000 yuan one after another.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds and Foreign Shares Fell</h3>
<p>Public bonds also fell yesterday, with a transaction volume of only 4 million. The unified C opened at 23,200 yuan, fell to 22,200 yuan, and then leveled off slightly. As a result, compared with last Saturday, A and B fell by 1,000 yuan, C fell by 1,700 yuan, D fell by 830 yuan, and the unified E also fell slightly by 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign shares were in a sluggish situation in various industries yesterday, and also fell back. Retail investors bought slightly, while bank gangs, securities gangs, and foreign firm gangs supplied. Yisha opened at 330,000 yuan, once fell to 298,000 yuan, and then struggled to rise back to around 325,000 yuan. Hong Kong Shen Electric Telegraph rose to 3.9 yuan. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the British Association, German Machinery, Guangye, Yipi, Shipping, and Steel Industries each fell by 10%, Xiangtai fell miserably by 1.5%, and Yisha paper, telephone, and tram each fell by 0.5%.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics are Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, woolen fabrics were quite popular. Floral wool, tweed, serge, Huarong ne Xuanwei, overcoat ne Pinghou ne, Mai Erden uniform ne, and other retail transactions were extremely prosperous. Men's and women's clothing stores on Hubei Road, Linsen Road, and Nanjing Road are now doing good business in clothes. The association with Qi Street gang is also busy. There are more buyers than sellers at the Changle Teahouse. Although the market is still stable tomorrow, it is secretly showing a slight increase.</p>
<h3>National Bank Strictly Restricts the Use of Bills on the Same Day</h3>
<p>It is reported that before the new method of restricting the use of bills on the same day has been promulgated, the National Bank will strictly implement the previous order of the Ministry of Finance in order to thoroughly implement urgent measures to suppress economic chaos, eliminate speculative merchants who are making waves, stabilize finance, and improve people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Bill Allocation is Based on Last Month's Balance</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The second phase of the US dollar short-term treasury bills for the 36th year began to be sold on October 1st. As of the end of November, a total of US$2,115,050 was sold nationwide, including US$380. The allocation amount for December has been stipulated by the Ministry of Finance. It is temporarily based on the balance of the November allocation that has not yet been sold, and will be adjusted appropriately later depending on the fundraising situation.</p>
<h3>Multiple Longs Express Scarcity of Transactions: Gauze and Cloth Sold Off Amidst Cries; Spot Cotton Prices Plunge Due to Supply Exceeding Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was sluggish due to tight credit and the concurrent opening sales of spinning mills under construction.  Many longs unwound their positions, leading to widespread sell-offs and a steady decline in prices.  Eventually, the 42-count Blue Wind fine yarn fell below the 50 million mark, reaching a low of 46 million yuan, a sharp drop of 4.5 million yuan per bale compared to the closing price of the weekend. Other yarns, both coarse and fine, also experienced significant declines of 2 to 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw major players offloading their holdings due to various factors unfavorable to buyers, causing a sharp decline in market prices. As a result, various grades of fine cloth, including 12-pound Dragon Head, experienced a uniform and drastic drop of 110,000 to 120,000 yuan compared to the closing price last Saturday.  Drill, twill, poplin, Yuan-chih tribute cloth, and Yuan-quality satin all fell by around 100,000 yuan. Only 190 Schappe cloth and colored cloth maintained a relatively firm market tone.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was weak due to the sluggish yarn and cloth markets, resulting in extremely low confidence. The tight credit situation further exacerbated the issue, leading to a supply exceeding demand. Prices plunged sharply, transactions stalled, and very little business was conducted, with only 150 bales changing hands.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Opinions on the Control of Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, a reporter briefly inquired about the rumored comprehensive control of cotton yarn and cloth by the authorities, consulting Mr. Wang Qiyu, the chairman of the Cotton Spinning Association in District Six. Mr. Wang stated that if the government could consider the production costs of spinning mills and resolve the issue of raw material funding, preventing mills from ceasing or reducing production, then the spinning mills should sincerely cooperate given the current national crisis. However, the business strategies of various private spinning mills may differ, and his personal opinion may not represent the views of all private spinning mills.</p>
<h3>Transportation Difficulties Increase Costs: Fuel Control Committee Adjusts Coal Prices; Roughly a 40% Increase Compared to November</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the person in charge of the Fuel Control Committee released a statement regarding the committee's adjustment of coal allocation prices and costs for the current month: The prices at which the committee purchases coal from various controlled mines are all approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the addition of various necessary expenses for allocation to various parties. The selling price is also set by the ministry, and there is absolutely no profit to be made.</p>
<p>Besides controlling the Kai-luan, Huainan in East China, and Taiwan mines, the committee allows manufacturers to purchase and transport all domestic coal on their own. The committee does not control domestic white coal at all, and businesses are free to procure it. The greatest reason for the supply of domestic coal not meeting demand is the lack of smooth transportation. Despite several months of effort, the committee has not yet seen results in this area. For example, the railway section from Jiaozuo to Xinxiang is damaged, and despite repeated consultations with the Ministries of National Defense and Communications to rush repairs, there is still no concrete solution. The shortage of vehicles on the Beining Railway and the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, coupled with frequent military use, has a significant impact on coal transportation. As of now, the Kai-luan mining area has a stockpile of over 600,000 tons of coal, Huainan has 50,000 to 60,000 tons, and East China has 30,000 to 40,000 tons. Even if the coal supply is opened up, it is feared that industry will not have the capacity to transport it. Therefore, improving transportation, especially railway transportation, is the key to resolving the coal shortage.</p>
<p>The adjusted prices for coal allocation in December are as follows: A. Public utilities: 1.5 million yuan. B. Railways, military transportation, and navy: 1.73 million yuan. C. Power plants, steamships, and transportation institutions in other cities: graded pricing, ranging from 1.73 million yuan to 2.12 million yuan. D. Factories and military/government agencies: graded pricing, ranging from 2.17 million yuan to 2.59 million yuan. E. The allocation price for foreign coal and white coal will be approximately 40% higher than the November allocation price.</p>
<h3>Applications to the Transport Control Committee for Acquisition and Return of Imports</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It has been learned that, from November 23rd to 29th, importers applied to the quota allocation office of the Transport Control Committee to have approved imports acquired. These included over US$19,000 worth of chemical products, over US$1,000 worth of rubber, over US$1,000 worth of oils and waxes, over US$38,000 worth of paper and wood pulp, US$800 worth of pharmaceuticals, and over US$23,000 worth of timber, totaling twelve applications. From November 16th to 22nd, there were fourteen applications totaling over US$148,100. As of the 29th, over 180 applications were made to the non-quota allocation office for import licenses for goods under Schedule One, with 121 applications approved. As of the 29th, there were two applications to acquire goods under Schedule Three A. As for requests to return goods to their origin for re-export, there were as many as 513 applications.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Credit in the city was extremely tight yesterday morning. The shadow interest rate briefly hovered around 2.5%, but eased slightly in the afternoon, with the shadow interest rate dropping back to 2.2%. Interest-bearing Huagu shares ranged from 2.3% to 2.75%. The net shortfall of national banks was 17 billion yuan. It is expected that credit will be tight today because national banks will have a large settlement of cotton yarn and food. Yesterday, the joint reserve of the silver dollar industry released about 8 to 900 million yuan of funds, and the silver dollar industry and the Sino-American Bank remained relatively stable. Among the national banks, the Central Bank had a shortfall of 47.4 billion yuan, the China Farmers Bank had a surplus of 17.4 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau had a surplus of 57.8 billion yuan, and other banks had no major inflows or outflows. In addition, major clearing houses had 81.9 billion yuan inflow, foreign banks had 43.2 billion yuan inflow, and small clearing houses had 108.1 billion yuan outflow.</p>
<h3>Rayon Plummets</h3>
<p>Rayon prices plummeted yesterday morning, falling approximately 10 million yuan lower than the previous weekend, and rebounded slightly in the afternoon, ultimately ending down 10 million yuan from the previous weekend's figure. 120-count Asahi glossy yarn opened at 102 million yuan, but attracted little interest, steadily declining to a low of 95 million yuan before recovering to 96.5 million yuan for spot transactions. 4A grade goods traded at 91 million yuan. Sentiment improved slightly in the afternoon, rising to a selling price of 90 million yuan, with final transactions occurring at 101 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The cigarette market yesterday saw a considerable number of transactions at the opening, but prices declined due to the sharp fall in various non-industry commodities. As a result, 10-pack Great Britain Old Knife brand and Liang cigarettes continued to drop 900,000 to 1.15 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>In the market for daily necessities, market sentiment declined. The prices of Solid Base and Scissor brand soaps continued to decrease by 20,000 yuan, while Beautiful Phoenix matches experienced a minor drop of over 10,000 yuan. Kerosene and candles remained firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday's timber market saw weak sentiment. Fir wood prices fell from the earlier price increase, and Western pine prices also became unsustainable.</p>

<p>Xuejin Weekly</p>
<h3>Inaugural Statement</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qixun</p>
<p>The name "Xuejin Weekly" (學津周刊) literally means "academic ferry." This publication hopes to serve as a bridge connecting universities and society. The editors of this publication are all currently teaching at universities, covering fields in humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Generally speaking, the humanities aim to understand oneself, the social sciences to understand others, and the natural sciences to understand the universe. Only by knowing oneself, others, and the universe can one achieve comprehensive self-cultivation. This is the common meaning of modern university education and also the purpose of this publication.</p>
<p>Freedom is the foundation of democracy. Everyone has freedom, but this does not mean that everyone can be selfish and self-serving. Every free person should have a sense of responsibility, be loyal to the truth and to the community, and be open-minded and discerning towards the views of others. The spirit of freedom is, in fact, the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, emphasizing observation, valuing experience, respecting facts, trusting evidence, making systematic rather than deductive reasoning, and forming objective judgments. Cultivating this kind of mental habit is the core issue of civic education in a democratic country. "Knowing the importance of tolerance without falling into nihilism, knowing the importance of faith without falling into dogmatism, knowing the importance of criticism without falling into cynical misanthropy." This is what a free society depends on. Today, the psychological basis of our national construction also encompasses these key points.</p>
<p>Today is the atomic age. The flames of Hiroshima, Japan, will forever leave a solemn lesson in people's minds. Modern problems are all deeply influenced by science and technology. The value of science lies in its method. The scientific method is a tool for overcoming prejudice and eliminating misunderstandings. Both fearing science and worshiping science are mistakes. What is needed now is to understand science. We should integrate theoretical and practical knowledge, technology, and concepts in science, and through public opinion, enable the general public to understand them. Only in this way can modern culture be safe and sound.</p>
<p>However, science cannot represent all academics. Science must be complemented by the humanities. The humanities include philosophy, history, literature, and art. Their difference from science lies in the fact that science only asks for causes, not purposes; only asks for parts, not the whole. The humanities compensate for what science cannot reach. Scientific humanism is most needed in the modern world. Humanism originated in ancient times. Ancient Chinese culture and Greek culture both emphasized the character of the gentleman and regarded it as the standard for humanistic cultivation. However, modern humanists must understand scientific methods and the scientific spirit and keep pace with the times. Therefore, it is also called scientific new humanism. This publication is named "Xuejin" (學津), hoping to work hard to culturalize science.</p>
<h3>The Division Between Ancient and Modern Science</h3>
<p>— Chen Li</p>
<p>From a sociological point of view, science is the embodiment of the spirit of the age (Zeitgeist). Since science cannot transcend the background of the times, modern science and ancient science must have some differences in viewpoints or purposes due to the different eras, not to mention the vast difference in their achievements. This article aims to outline some of the important differences.</p>
<p>First, ancient science emphasized the ultimate nature of things. Chinese Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory and the ancient Greek atomic theory, such as Empedocles' water, fire, earth, and air, were all used to explain the ultimate nature of all things. Aristotle defined physics as "the inquiry into the nature of things," and we especially value the term "nature." Nature can obviously be analyzed into two points: one is origin (Origin), and the other is essence (Essence). The Greeks, like the philosophers of the Qin and Han dynasties, easily involved the origin of the universe when discussing nature. When we read their descriptions of the initial chaos, "In the beginning was an indefinite incoherent homogeneity," we naturally associate them with the Chinese philosophers, such as the "Astronomical Training" chapter of the Huainanzi:</p>
<p>"Before heaven and earth took shape, there was a boundless and indistinct state, hence called Tai Shi (太始). Tai Shi produced emptiness (虛　), emptiness produced the universe, and the universe produced primordial Qi (元氣). Primordial Qi had boundaries. The clear and light (淸陽) dispersed and became heaven, while the heavy and turbid (重濁) congealed and became earth. The combination of the clear and light was easy, while the congealing of the heavy and turbid was difficult. Therefore, heaven was formed first and earth was established later..."</p>
<p>We may feel confused by this evolutionary view regarding the ancient science's emphasis on essence. The basic characteristic of essence is immutability, so how could ancient science produce the theory of evolution? Unless we see this point clearly, it is difficult for us to understand the fundamental differences between ancient and modern science in their views on evolution.</p>
<p>Take the above-quoted Huainanzi as an example. How did heaven and earth evolve? This is because Qi has principles and paths, and there are clear and turbid elements. The heavy and turbid congealed downwards to form the earth, while the light and clear floated upwards to form the heaven. The reason for evolution lies in the essence of things. Not only is the result of evolution determined by the essence of things, but also the order of the stages. "The combination of the clear and light was easy, while the congealing of the heavy and turbid was difficult. Therefore, heaven was formed first and earth was established later." The order of priority is obviously determined by the nature of things. Therefore, if one can understand the nature of matter, the phenomena between heaven and earth can be easily traced back like following a map.</p>
<p>Since the process of all phenomena can be deduced from the nature of things, deductive reasoning occupied an extremely high position in ancient science. Plato regarded geometry as the queen of all sciences because geometry is purely deductive. Since "the trend is inevitable and the principle is inherent," observation is unnecessary, or at least secondary, and experimentation is even less important. Since everything can be deduced, why should we be concerned with the evidence before our eyes? "The knowledge of the ears and eyes is limited," and experience becomes a burden to "innate knowledge." For example, a straight line, the straight line in experience, is neither straight nor a line, and often becomes an obstacle to reasoning. Another reason why geometry was admired by the Greeks was because they believed that geometric reasoning did not rely on the observations of the ears and eyes. This kind of not relying on observation, not relying on experience, and relying solely on innate knowledge is the most different point between ancient science and today's science. Because there is no need for empirical evidence, ancient science began by discussing the state of affairs at the time of "the opening of chaos." Modern people like to say that this is today's theory of evolution. In fact, this has nothing to do with the modern theory of evolution. Why? Because this kind of evolution is completely based on reasoning and not on facts. In the world of myriad phenomena, we can extract several identical essences. From these essences, we can extract more original essences, the so-called "to differentiate further, the more differentiated it becomes, until there is no differentiation, and then it stops" (Xunzi, "Rectification of Names"). From the particular to the general, from the general to the "formless" prototype or the infinite behind it. This kind of reasoning from complex to simple can originate from pure logical deduction, that is, the connotation shrinks day by day, the extension expands day by day, reaching the peak, the connotation approaches zero, even the forms are gone, and the extension encompasses everything. The result of this kind of reasoning is naturally simpler the further it goes, which is similar to the modern theory of evolution in form. But in spirit, the two are completely opposite and should not be forced into one discussion.</p>
<p>The focus of modern science is not the essence of things, but the relationship between things. This can be clearly seen from Galileo's experiment on falling weights. Aristotle's viewpoint is essential, so he said that objects have weight, and heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. But Galileo believed that the difference in falling speed has nothing to do with essence. Regardless of weight or size, objects should fall at the same speed. The difference is due to the environment. In modern science education, middle school physics experiments use a feather and a coin falling together in a vacuum glass tube, and we see that they both fall at the same time. In other words, the difference in the speed of the falling phenomenon is not due to the lightness or heaviness of the essence, making "the heavy must be fast, and the light must be slow." Rather, it is due to the relationship of the environment, the resistance of the air, that the feather and the coin show different speeds when falling.</p>
<p>Now let's turn back to discuss the theory of evolution in modern science. Darwin's theory of evolution does not assume that species have an internal essence that must change, but rather as a result of adapting to the environment. The so-called "survival of the fittest," "survival" refers to the relationship between organisms, and "fittest" refers to the relationship between organisms and the natural environment. In short, the focus is on relationship and not on essence. This major shift in perspective has sparked a thorough revolution in science, with observation and experiment replacing formal reasoning, and static logic turning to dynamic logic.</p>
<p>Since past science emphasized essence, taxonomy was the key to academic methods. Because if a person knows that something belongs to a certain category or race, we can infer its necessary attributes from the nature of its category or race. Just knowing that Confucius is a human being, we know that Confucius must die, because death is an attribute of human beings. Although the author argued above that ancient science did not rely on observation, ancient science did not completely abandon observation. For example, Aristotle did some observational work. Classification often requires observation, but observation only goes as far as classification. Everything after that is in deduction. The so-called change is also the same. Ancient science did not ignore change, but its so-called change was only the unfolding of essence, like the gradual unfolding of a painting to reach a complete state. For example, a child is a human being and has human attributes, so he must develop into an adult. His development is determined by his essence, we only need to know that he is a human being. Although this view does not reject the concept of change, the viewpoint is static. His coming development has long been hidden in the beginning's "clue." Therefore, the ancient science's theory of evolution is conservative and predetermined.</p>
<p>The modern science's theory of evolution is completely different. It does not tend to a predetermined prototype. The mutual relationship between things determines its destiny path. Therefore, we cannot predict its destination solely from its essence. We have to observe, because relationships are infinite, so observation is endless. For example, although 26 letters (essence) are known, the combination and transformation (relationship) of 26 letters is endless. One cannot infer the meaning of the word spelled out from 26 letters. Each spelling has a new meaning, so each relationship must be re-observed. The viewpoint of the new science is dynamic, and the change is endless. Because of this, the current science emphasizes experimentation. The essence of experimentation is to change conditions (that is, the mutual relationship between environment and essence) to observe, that is, to observe its changes, rather than to observe its constants. Experimentation is about observing how it is under certain conditions, how it changes under different conditions, and how it changes under other conditions. Observation is the center of modern science, unlike ancient science which only used it to determine the premise. The conclusions of the current science must still be confirmed by observation. This is perhaps the most obvious boundary between the current and ancient science. How modern evolutionary theory strives to find the so-called "Missing Link" is obviously completely different from the complete system of ancient evolutionary theory.</p>
<p>Unless we understand the position of the experimental method in modern science, it is difficult for us to appreciate the basic differences between ancient and modern science. Ancient science had observation but no experimentation, because ancient science valued essence, so sometimes it had to rely on observation to make the basis of classification. Its whole spirit was in essence, so it did not need too much observation, let alone changing conditions to observe, because it innately recognized that conditions were accidental and not the inevitable essence of the phenomenon. Its viewpoint is static, so its so-called evolution is still just unfolding, ready-made unfolding, without new creation. The current science's viewpoint is dynamic, its object is change, and its focus is on mutual relations, so conditions are the direct object of scientific research. Therefore, it not only observes existing things, but also changes conditions to observe. In this way, evolution is not a passive unfolding but an active adaptation. This one is moving and the other is static, this is the different spirit between the current and ancient science, and perhaps the different between Eastern and Western civilizations.</p>
<h3>On the Independence of Scholarship</h3>
<p>— Xie Zuoyu</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shih recently proposed a ten-year plan for Chinese education, advocating that our country should concentrate its efforts within ten years to develop ten top-tier universities that can compete with European and American universities. After that, our country will no longer need to send students to study abroad. In order to strive for the independence of scholarship, our study abroad plan must be terminated. The scholarship and education of a country cannot depend on foreign countries forever.</p>
<p>Hu's plan has aroused considerable debate among domestic scholars. However, these debates are not aimed at denying Hu's major premise. Hu's major premise, or fundamental argument, is:</p>
<p>"Striving for the independence of scholarship." No one dares to deny, and cannot deny, this major premise. The author naturally does not want to deny this major premise, but the author believes that although the goal of "scholarship independence" is clear, the question is how to achieve this goal. Can the goal of "scholarship independence" be achieved by running a few good universities? This is not certain. It depends on the degree of "goodness." And there is a more fundamental question. If this more fundamental question is not resolved, scholarship will still not be independent.</p>
<p>What is the more fundamental question? This is the freedom of thought. The so-called freedom of thought means that thought is free from its own shackles, not limited by traditional thought, nor limited by foreign thought, and has the freedom to come and go alone. There was an advocacy of the "thought liberation movement" in the early Republic of China, which was originally very good. Unfortunately, this movement was not thorough and did not achieve its goal. People who talked about thought liberation in the early Republic of China only knew how to get rid of the shackles of traditional thought, only knew how to oppose the old morality, old etiquette, old literature, and old system, believing that as long as the old was overthrown, our thought could be liberated. They indiscriminately rejected the old. At the same time, they indiscriminately welcomed the new. Any thought, as long as it was novel, they introduced and accepted. One doctrine today and one theory tomorrow, all kinds of things, nothing is not strange. Almost everything in the West is good and worthy of our imitation. So when Dewey came to China, our intellectual circles followed Dewey. When Russell came to China, our intellectual circles followed Russell again. When Durisch and Tagore came to China, a part of our intellectual circles followed these two people again. The same is true for philosophy, politics, education, literature, etc. From the early Republic of China to the present, our intellectual circles have been following Westerners, circling in the scope of Western thought, and acting as gramophones for Western thinkers. Even if their thoughts get rid of the shackles of traditional thought, they have not gotten rid of the shackles of Western thought. Those who are unwilling to be slaves to the thoughts of the ancients are very willing to be slaves to the thoughts of the present people, the Westerners. They removed one kind of shackle, but added another kind of shackle. Their thoughts have never been liberated. The reason is that their thoughts are not independent, only moved by the word "novelty," and blindly bumping around aimlessly. As a result, our intellectual circles have not created any new thoughts. In this way, how can we talk about the independence of scholarship!</p>
<p>Therefore, the author believes that in order to strive for the independence of scholarship, we must first strive for the independence of thought. If thought is not independent, one has no definite views, loses what one holds within, and only blindly hates the old or blindly follows the new. If the ways of today do not change the style of the early Republic of China, then such an attitude will never promote the independence of scholarship. Taking such an attitude to run a university will not run the university well, at best it will follow Western universities, doing its best to imitate, but unable to surpass them. This does not count as scholarship independence. The foundation of scholarship independence lies in the independence of thought and in the innovation of thought.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Thought and Times"</h3>

<h3>The Trend of Modern Thought</h3>
<p>— Xie Youwei</p>
<p>After the Great War, there was bound to be a change in the world of thought, a new trend, and this was what everyone expected and eagerly wanted to know. Conflicts and contradictions in thought can lead to suspicion and misunderstanding between people and between nations. We have deeply experienced that the formation of war is related to this. We never want conflicts and contradictions in thought. However, the reality before our eyes seems to be the conflict and contradiction of thought. We see the confrontation between the two major blocs, the United States and the Soviet Union, engaging in a life-and-death struggle in diplomacy. We also see the division of India and the antagonism between the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine. In France, Italy, Greece, and China, there are also their own political struggles. All of these contain ideological conflicts, political or religious. These conflicts also seem very sharp, very serious, and impossible to reconcile or unify. On the surface, modern thought presents a state of division, contradiction, and complexity. This is what those who care about world peace are concerned about.</p>
<p>However, the divided, contradictory, and complex state of contemporary thought seems to be only a superficial state. We have vaguely seen a glimmer of dawn emerging from these states. In fact, contemporary thought has gradually shifted from a divided, contradictory, and complex direction to a unified, harmonious, and integrated path. We can boldly say that the true trend of modern thought is to move towards unification, harmony, and integration. This can be examined from various aspects.</p>
<p>First, from a cultural or philosophical point of view, in the past, we always thought that Eastern and Western culture or philosophy could never be reconciled and unified. The words of the English poet Kipling, "East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet," were accepted by many Eastern and Western scholars. But everything is different now than it used to be. Now, not only are Easterners striving to understand the West and accept Western culture and philosophy, but Westerners are also striving to understand the East and introduce Eastern culture and philosophy. Recently, the American philosopher F.S.C. Northrop wrote a book entitled "The Meeting of East and West," which represents this attempt. He said: "East and West are meeting, are combining. The era so aptly described and so wrongly predicted by Kipling is past. If we want to understand ourselves, we must understand the East; if we want to avoid another tragedy, another catastrophe, another bloodshed, we must learn how to combine the values of East and West, and that time has come." He believes that not only is it possible to combine Eastern and Western cultures, but it is also necessary. Only the combination of Eastern and Western cultures can express the truth of things and conform to the latest scientific discoveries. In addition, the American philosopher Charles A. Moore and others jointly compiled a book entitled "Philosophy, East and West," advocating that Western philosophers should study Eastern philosophy. Among them, Professor W.E.Hocking wrote: "Easterners are smarter. Their philosophy is often in practical use. They have no philosophy and religion that are not in use. Their reflection is often closely related to their actions. We must learn from the East the practical significance of metaphysics. A nation that can produce such a poor system of thought, such as the logical positivists who declare metaphysical problems to be meaningless, has reason to quietly receive the spirit of the Easterners." From this, we can know that the work of the modern intellectual community does have a trend of Eastern and Western culture and philosophy.</p>
<p>Second, from a political and economic point of view, we also always thought that capitalism and communism were irreconcilable, and that Anglo-American democracy and Soviet democracy could never be combined and reconciled. I am afraid that there are still many people who believe this, because this is what the current situation tells us. However, the current situation is still superficial. From the actual work of contemporary thinkers and politicians, we have reason to believe that this opposition, this conflict, is on the road to unification and harmony. We all know that the United Kingdom and the United States represent capitalism and political democracy, but thinkers and politicians in the United Kingdom and the United States also know that this needs to be revised and supplemented. Thinkers such as Dewey, Russell, and Laski all unanimously attacked and criticized capitalism. Laski's recent book, "Faith, Reason, and Civilization," declares that the establishment of a new belief in the world in the future cannot but take the ideals of the Soviet Union as a guide. Practical politicians, such as President Roosevelt's New Deal and the policies implemented by British Prime Minister Attlee, want to implement the ideal of Soviet economic democracy within the Anglo-American political system, that is, to unify the opposition between economic democracy and political democracy. Whether their attempts are successful is questionable, but at the very least, thinkers and practical politicians are doing this work of unification. Even on the Soviet side, although we do not hear the call to adopt Anglo-American democracy, but comparing the early politics of the Soviet Union with the current stage of politics in the Soviet Union, we cannot but admit that the Soviet Union is also moving towards political democracy, but the progress is slightly slower. It can be seen that the division of modern political economy also has a trend of harmony and unification.</p>
<p>Third, from a religious point of view, we believe that this is the most hopeless for harmony and unification. The complexity and contradiction of current religions are the most headache for politicians and religious figures. I am afraid that no one dares to think of unifying the religions of the world. However, although the current religions are so complex and conflicting, from the history of religious evolution, we cannot but admit that religion is also moving towards harmony and unification. The complexity of modern religion is not as complex as that of ancient religion. Western Christianity and Indian Buddhism have done a lot of unifying work in terms of the number of believers and the breadth of distribution. Moreover, most of the contemporary famous religious figures tend to unify and harmonize religions in their thoughts and propositions. For example, the Indian philosopher Tagore's book "The Religion of Man" advocates replacing the worship of God with the worship of human nature, which has the intention of unifying religion. The American philosopher Professor Hocking's book "Living Religions and a World Faith" also aims to integrate the elements of existing religions in order to establish a world-style belief. Christianity itself has many factions. Apart from the difference between Protestantism and Catholicism, Protestantism itself has many factions. However, it is now heard that many factions within Protestantism have a tendency to unite and combine. In some aspects, they have begun to cooperate. This cannot but be regarded as the beginning of the union of religion from division.</p>
<p>From the above points, the trend of modern thought is indeed striving towards unification, harmony, and integration. Their work is just beginning, so their achievements are not obvious. On the surface, the world's thinking is diverse and very complicated; but if we carefully study it, there are signs of unity in the complexity, and there is a state of harmony in the conflict. We do not seem to need to be blinded by the surface and be overly anxious about the contradictions and conflicts of world thought, or express despair about the future of world peace. A glimmer of light has appeared in the darkness. We should welcome the light and fulfill our responsibility in the intellectual community.</p>

<h3>Wu Jingxiong's Quotations</h3>
<p>— Wen Jie</p>
<p>Li Bai looked at nature with a telescope; Du Fu looked at nature with a microscope.</p>
<p>In Li Bai's eyes, the stars in the sky are just fireflies; in Du Fu's eyes, the fireflies on the ground are the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>It is difficult to regard death as returning home, and it is even more difficult to live a life like death.</p>
<p>Sudden death is the only way to avoid death; know that such death means that you have died before you know you have died.</p>
<p>If you say that God only helps those who help themselves, then God is simply like American isolationists; the God in my heart is one who helps those who help others.</p>
<p>To love others as yourself, you must first love yourself as others.</p>
<p>Whether a person is great or not does not depend on the external environment; for a truly great person, adversity only makes him greater.</p>
<p>Anyone who is extraordinary must have a period in his life when he changes from being worldly to being detached from the world, and then from being detached from the world to being a higher level of worldly.</p>
<p>I guess the reason why the East and the West cannot merge is because there are so-called "great men" in the world; in the hearts of the small people in the world, the East and the West have never been divided. If you read the maxims of various countries, we can know how similar the philosophy of the small people in various parts of the world has been from ancient times to the present. On the contrary, if you read the political speeches of today's "great men," you will be surprised at how divergent their views are.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1922, I went to Washington, D.C. to visit my old friend Holmes (the late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States). He led me to visit his studio. He took out the books on the bookshelf one by one and gave each book a close and affectionate commentary. Finally, he said, "I haven't shown you the best books here yet." I said, "I would like to visit." He said, "Look, those best books are on that bookshelf." My gaze followed his hand to the left corner of the room and landed on an empty bookshelf. I admitted that I was simply confused. I asked the host what this meant: he said, "I'm not joking. Those best books have yet to be written!"</p>
<h3>Interest and Emotion</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>The travel season is coming to an end, but it is said that many travel agencies are still fully booked every weekend. Although train and long-distance bus fares have been increased again and again, they cannot stop the pleasure-seeking desires of people who want to temporarily escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Human life is only a few decades, so why not enjoy yourself in time! This is originally an emotional requirement that cannot be blamed.</p>
<p>Playing has no purpose, but it is not without purpose. Can you say that the desire for sensory enjoyment itself does not contain a purpose? However, a pre-arranged purpose may not necessarily satisfy our enjoyment requirements. Two or three friends were chatting enthusiastically tonight, saying that they wanted to eat Wuxi's pork ribs and stir-fried crab roe, and by the way, go to Yuantouzhu to see Taihu Lake, so they agreed to run tomorrow. This Qiu has a purpose, but more importantly, it has "interest."</p>
<p>That's right. True emotional expression cannot be without the mood of interest. The same as emotional expression, recreational activities based on interest and recreational activities for temporary stimulation have an important distinction between truth and falsehood.</p>
<p>Take the current travel fever of ordinary people as an example. As long as you have money, one phone call can register you with a travel agency for the destination you wish to go to. You don't have to worry about tickets, food, accommodation, or even entertainment programs. You don't have to run much from your house to your destination, and you will still be sent back to your house in the end. This is so labor-saving and convenient. However, although this satisfies your travel desire, how much interest does it satisfy?</p>
<p>The problem is not that the travel agency arranges everything for you so thoroughly; even if it is a round-trip express trip on the same day, as long as you are sincerely interested, you can satisfy your interest in a fleeting glance--an emotion based on nature.</p>
<p>This is just a superficial analogy. In the current living environment, things that can stimulate people's true emotions are indeed in strange forms. Flaunting and fashion have become the main emotional tones of life, and the atmosphere of shouting exaggeration covers everything. News headlines are racking their brains to find the daily Headline, articles must pay attention to stimulation, and people must have a "stand," true color, black, white, red, and even gray everything overwhelms the world. The air of art and academics is gone, and under the rigid surface is a scene of absurdity.</p>
<p>This is not a cold, cynical view. The current living phenomenon is indeed very terrible. Some people are now talking about saving people's hearts. But in my personal opinion, this is not just a simple problem of the world going downhill. Revitalizing morality and so on is meaningless, the problem is that people's true feelings are suppressed by layers of false forms and are about to be completely destroyed. To cleanse this atmosphere cannot be done in a short time and in one place. At this time, it is important to allow everyone to work hard in their individual circles of life to maintain their own share of leading interest, that is, to maintain their share of true emotion. Some people criticize playing with things and losing ambition, but today, as long as you can still maintain a share of "playing" interest, you will not worry about falling because of this. You must know that true seriousness not only does not contradict true emotions, but the latter is also an important motivation for the former.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of the World</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the most amazing figure in Wall Street in the United States was Fiske. He started out selling military blankets during the Civil War. By 1869, he was so rich that he could rival a country. He even joined forces with several like-minded partners to monopolize all the gold in the United States. As a result, hundreds of banks were forced into bankruptcy by them, and Fiske's ambitions were not realized in the end. This Mr. Fiske dropped out of school at an early age and was illiterate.</p>
<p>The latest invention of the American door lock is a button. You push open a piece of steel plate on the outside of the lock and you will see eight buttons. Then, according to the code you know, press three of the buttons in succession, and the door will naturally open. If you press the wrong button, the bell will ring loudly immediately inside.</p>
<p>An Australian pregnant woman, seven months pregnant, was suddenly hit in the abdomen by a stray bullet. Five days later, she gave birth to a child. However, although this child was born prematurely, his whole body, except for a bullet hole in one leg, was surprisingly healthy and without any damage.</p>

<h3>Terrible Indifference</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>More than a hundred men, women, and children of overseas Chinese on South Sakhalin Island, after living there for decades, finally couldn't bear the oppression of the new occupying authorities, and helplessly abandoned the little property they had left, and returned to their motherland in the cold wind.</p>
<p>However, what did the motherland give them?——It was a scene of embarrassing indifference! The Soviet authorities who transported them back to China discussed with the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was probably the poorest government agency in Shanghai. Looking for the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, they also had no money. Then looking for the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration said that the relief matters had already ended. In the end, Mayor Wu finally agreed to provide them with a strict period of supply. A week will pass quickly, and how they will maintain their lives after that is still uncertain. If I may say it cruelly, perhaps, by that time, the forgetful people of Shanghai will have forgotten them long ago!</p>
<p>In the Dutch East Indies, countless overseas Chinese were displaced and exiled, and were robbed and killed. To this day, the Indonesian authorities' promise to compensate for the losses is still just empty talk, and to this day their lives and property are still without any security. In India, the Xinjiang Hui Pilgrimage Delegation was repeatedly obstructed by the war. The Central News Agency once reported that there were problems with food and clothing, and after that, nothing more was heard about it. In post-war Japan, the so-called Shibuya Incident actually happened!</p>
<p>If it is said that the people in the country deliberately ignore the overseas Chinese, it is not necessarily so. In fact, it is more terrible than "deliberately ignoring" them. They have simply "forgotten" that the overseas Chinese are still Chinese!</p>
<h3>Two or Three Things About Dafu</h3>
<p>— Ma Bin</p>
<p>I knew Mr. Yu Dafu fifteen years ago. At that time, Dafu was still engaged in writing novels, but his style was slightly different from that of the Creation Society. The famous "Caishiji" and "Autumn Night on Bilang Lake" were works of this period; when he moved to Hangzhou, he began to write more essays and travel notes, and the Shanghai newspapers happily called him "travel writer," and Yu was also happy about it.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, although Dafu's financial situation was not very well-off, it was still a "peaceful and prosperous age." He sold his articles to buy wine and had more than enough to live on. His lifestyle was completely different from the chaotic times. Dafu loved to drink. Anyone who invited him with wine would come. He once got drunk in Apricot Blossom Village and wrote a sentence: "Ten days of autumn overcast, the water hits the sky, the lakes and mountains are good, but they are not allowed to be drunk; but with the extremely cheap Hangzhou wine, get drunk in front of Yue Fei's tomb in Xiling." This scene is now unforgettable.</p>
<p>Dafu lived in Hangzhou and liked to socialize. He treated officials, dignitaries, poor people, and students alike. Shao Lizi was an old acquaintance of his in Shanghai. Xuan Tiewu, Zhou Xiangxian, Zhao Longwen, and others had deep friendships with Yu. I remember his reply to Zhao Longwen's sentence "Live another ten years in the world." The lakes and mountains are still the same, but the old travels cannot be looked back on.</p>
<p>Dafu was good at self-intoxication. He once bought aviation lottery tickets, expecting that he would definitely win, and planned the uses as follows: 10,000 yuan remitted to Fuyang to support his mother, 15,000 yuan to support his family in Hangzhou, 5,000 yuan to send to friends, and 20,000 gold left for himself to travel around the world with a wonderful woman... I laughed at him, and immediately said that after living in Sumatra, on the wedding night, he also wrote: "When will Xi Shi follow Fan Li, and talk about the grudges in the misty waters of the Five Lakes." Dafu used this ideal to dispel his middle age, but he finally died for his ambition, alas.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Watching Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Ruyi</p>
<p>The heroine in the play stood at the very front of the stage, with her hands pressed against her chest, singing out her unbearable suffering in a low song. Then she turned her back, raised her feet high, and took a step. The orchestra immediately played hard, and the cymbals made a clanging sound, meaning to let the audience know that she had committed suicide by throwing herself into the sea.</p>
<p>The audience nodded in approval. The noisy sound of the orchestra suddenly changed to a tense allegro, and the hero jumped onto the stage, his legs stiff. He lowered a horse whip, indicating that he had dismounted, and then slightly covered his forehead with his hand to avoid the intense glare of the sea. He saw the girl who was about to sink, and he stepped into the sea (at this time, the sound of the cymbals was loud), and rescued the girl.</p>
<p>The audience was obviously very satisfied, and they comfortably leaned back in their chairs and watched. Ever since the Great Wall of China, they have liked this set. As long as they are willing to come, you can know that they really like it. You must know that a Peking Opera takes longer than watching two movies in a row. An ordinary play takes from 7:00 in the afternoon to 11:00, and a "good" play on Sunday takes from 7:00 to 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>The reason why they like Peking Opera may be partly because it is a drama in which the actors and the audience are integrated. The lights in the theater are never turned off. If the stage setting is in line with the plot, it is only a coincidence. The audience needs to imagine when the plot takes place. Except that the stage is slightly higher than the pool seats, there is simply no gap between the actors and the audience.</p>
<p>Newspaper vendors, candy vendors, and small vendors selling fruits and soda come and go, and their business is very prosperous.</p>
<p>The play is still being performed seriously on stage. The villain in the play is also a clown. He stretches out a hand and wipes it under his nose, and the audience laughs. Later, he became more and more cunning, and you can see how much the audience hates him. When the most tense scene came, he prepared to hang himself, but the window sill where he tied the rope suddenly broke, and he fell. The audience laughed so hard that they almost fell over. ...</p>
<p>Translator's note: Whenever there are foreign envoys coming to China, or there are international conferences held in China, it seems that inviting them to watch a Peking Opera has become an indispensable article. But what do foreigners think of Peking Opera? A short article in the November 15th issue of Collier's magazine made me smile after reading it, so I translated it together.</p>
<h3>Integrity</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Willow South Anecdotes records that the Lushan monk Huanzhu cried for his brother in a poem: "The head is only precious after being cut by a knife, and the bones only smell fragrant after the corpse is not sealed." Records of Poems of the Sui Dynasty records that a woman went to the river and died when the country was broken (unfortunately, I forgot her name). Her slogan on the way said: "Tell the passers-by not to cover their noses, the living are not as fragrant as the dead!" Both poems are calm and powerful, with every word a drop of blood, which is enough to be a model for thousands of years. As for Wang Jingwei's poem in prison, "Drawing a knife to become a fast, not living up to the head of a young man," his heroic spirit is also awe-inspiring. If Wang had died at this time, he would have been righteous and admired by the world, and there would be no need for future generations to say "When a strong wind blows down the parasol tree, others will have their say." But this traitor just happened not to die at this time, but died after becoming a great traitor. It was really good death not death, eating too much rice! This is what Taishigong meant by saying that there is a difference between Mount Tai and a feather in death! Bai Letian's poem says: "The Duke of Zhou was afraid of rumors, and Wang Mang was humble to the lower classes; if he had died in ordinary years, who would know the truth of his life!" If poetry can be borrowed, I will borrow it to chant his deeds.</p>
<h3>The Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter One: Joyfully Finding a Soulmate (2)</p>
<p>As he spoke, he saw Zhu Zhai standing stiffly beside him, and he smiled and said, "I forgot to introduce you. You two are both devotees of the Mei School and should get to know each other." He pointed at Zhu Zhai and said to the young lady, "This is my nephew Xu Zhu Zhai," and then pointed to the young lady, "This is the very famous Gu Qiwan, Boss Gu. I probably don't need to introduce her, you already know her." The moment Zhu Zhai saw the young lady's face, he guessed that she was Gu Qiwan. Now that Xiao Bai had confirmed it, he took a step closer, gave a slight bow, and called her Boss Gu. Qiwan nodded slightly and smiled. In her heart, she thought that this man was too handsome and could be considered a very flavorful handsome man, and she couldn't help but look at him again. Zhu Zhai turned to Xiao Bai and said, "Let's go sit in the Laijin Yuxuan pavilion. It's too windy here. Uncle, your health isn't good, don't stand here for too long." Xiao Bai nodded and led everyone to Laijin Yuxuan, where they sat down at a tea table. Xiao Bai hadn't eaten anything in the morning, so he ordered a glass of fresh milk. Zhu Zhai and Qiwan each ordered a glass of cocoa. While drinking his milk, Xiao Bai asked Zhu Zhai, "Have you been coming here often recently to practice your singing?" Zhu Zhai replied shyly, "No, it's because the radio station has allowed me to sing a cappella tonight. I'm afraid I'll ruin my voice at the last minute, so I came here to practice." Xiao Bai said, "Just now when you were singing *Yu Tang Chun*, you learned Mr. Mei's intonation very well. Only one or two words were not pronounced quite correctly. You are not from the professional performing industry, so to have achieved this level is already very rare." Zhu Zhai's face turned slightly red as he said, "Uncle, please don't be so complimentary. Just tell me which few words I mispronounced?" Xiao Bai finished the last mouthful of milk in his glass, put the glass down, and pointed at Qiwan with a smile, "She is also a self-taught student of Mr. Mei. You can just ask her and you'll know." Qiwan and Zhu Zhai were meeting for the first time. Even though she knew he had sung it wrong, how could she say it outright? She just smiled slightly and said, "Boss Fei, don't make things difficult for me. How would I know?" Xiao Bai said, "You two are both self-taught disciples of the Mei School and could both become famous. Zhu Zhai, you're just dabbling occasionally, so it doesn't matter if you sing it right or wrong. But Qiwan has such a good natural voice that she must formally become a disciple of Mr. Mei and receive his true teachings. She should not only learn his intonation, but also study his posture, stage presence, and so on." Qiwan said, "Yes, I've long harbored this ambition, but because Mr. Mei is currently far away in Hong Kong, I have no way to become his disciple." Xiao Bai said, "You will always have the opportunity to become his disciple in the future! As for Mr. Mei's morality, he is second to none in the current performing arts circle and can be considered a gentleman. Speaking for myself, I have benefited greatly from Mr. Mei's promotion. For many years, I performed in Shanghai. Because Boss Tan didn't arrive in time, I was asked to fill in. At the time, I was very afraid, fearing that I wouldn't be able to match up and would implicate Mr. Mei. Before the performance, I went to Mr. Mei for advice. Mr. Mei strongly encouraged me, saying, 'As long as you carefully understand the emotions of the play, you will be able to match up. Also your acting is more delicate than others and you understand the emotions of the play, because it's rooted in the script.' Hearing these words, I was truly grateful and considered him a true friend. On the night of the performance, I was very nervous and tried my best to please the audience, but because of my timidity, I showed some weaknesses on stage several times. Mr. Mei helped me through them, so not only was I not embarrassed in front of everyone, but I received applause from the audience."</p>
<h3>Gazing Idly at the Yuntai Pavilion, Counting the Stars of Generals</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The military situation in North China is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed. The capture of Yantai had boosted morale, but the recent loss of Shimen has made the situation tense again. As for the consolidation of war gains over the past two years, the widely praised achievement is General Chuan Zuozhi's recapture of Zhangjiakou. He not only secured this "important border town" (there is an archway with this inscription inside the "Dajingmen" gate of Zhangjiakou), but also controlled transportation between the central area and Suiyuan province, which invigorated the northwest region. Its importance is not minor. (Of the three major lines from Beiping to Zhangjiakou, the Hebei section of the Pinghan Railway has long been blocked, and the Pingjin Railway is also frequently damaged. Only the Pingsui Railway is relatively safe and secure, thanks to the protective efforts of General Chuan's forces.) He also has the strength to assist Liaodong and Hebei. Wherever he goes, he intimidates the enemy with his reputation, making him the mainstay for safeguarding the area.</p>
<p>In the northern army, there are two generals who are famously known as the "Generals of Loyalty and Righteousness," which is a rare occurrence. Chuan Zuozhi of Shanxi embodies "Righteousness," while Zixue of Shandong embodies "Loyalty." Both excel at fighting alone with their troops. Twenty years ago, the "General of Righteousness" led the Jin army into Zhangzhou, while the "General of Loyalty" defended Nanyang with the Shandong army alone. They fought against the odds in the same way, which is a remarkable coincidence.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the "General of Righteousness" supported the northwest region, while the "General of Loyalty" fought in southern Shandong, both earning reputations for bravery. Now, the "General of Loyalty" holds an important central position, which is certainly a crucial military assignment. However, considering his half-lifetime of military service, it can be said that he has "returned to simplicity after a splendid career." Meanwhile, the "General of Righteousness" is as vigorous as ever, still a "general on horseback" and a "victorious general." Last month, when Jidong was tense, he was invited to assist in the defense. Recently, due to the emergency in Shijiazhuang, the Beiping military headquarters also invited him to discuss military strategies (they met on the 18th and he returned to Zhangjiakou on the 19th). He is truly a general.</p>
<p>Recalling the Battle of Zhangzhou in 1926, it brings Zhang Xueliang to mind. At the time, Zhang Zuolin had established a military government in the Northeast, while Yan Xishan of Shanxi had joined the Northern Expedition. The entire province of Zhili (now Hebei) was under Zhang Zuolin's control. Chuan Zuozhi, under Yan Xishan's command, led a brigade to seize Zhangzhou through a small path, which was very close to Beiping. His daring spirit was similar to Deng Ai of the Three Kingdoms, who took Yinping by surprise. At the time, Zhang Xueliang led his 3rd and 4th Army Corps to attack for months, but could not capture the city. Later, through the efforts of local gentry and merchants, the city was opened to avoid civilian casualties. Zhang Xueliang admired his bravery and treated him with great respect.</p>
<p>In June of the following year, the Northern Expedition was successful. Zhang Xueliang had already surrendered and urged his father to leave the Northeast, remaining behind himself. His father was killed by the Japanese, and Zhang Xueliang succeeded him as the ruler of the Northeast. He eliminated the remnants of Zhang Zongchang's forces and, despite Japanese obstruction, raised the flag of the Republic of China, demonstrating a deep understanding of righteousness. Years later, he was deceived in Xi'an and made a great mistake. Fortunately, he immediately realized his error and has since retreated to the countryside, living a peaceful life from beginning to end. He is truly a wise man, living up to his name "Xueliang" (which means "learn from the good"), and his courtesy name "Hanqing" (which is associated with virtue).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Western Han Dynasty, Zhang Liang assisted Emperor Gaozu of Han and was one of the "Three Heroes." After achieving success, he retired, studied Taoism, and traveled with Chisongzi, living a life of accomplishment. This is why Zhang Xueliang "learned from Zhang Liang" and adopted the courtesy name "Hanqing."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Eastern Han Dynasty, General Feng Yi assisted Emperor Guangwu in defeating Wang Mang and restoring the Han Dynasty. He was humble and reserved. Whenever the generals discussed their merits, Feng Yi would always avoid them by sitting under a tree, earning him the nickname "General of the Big Tree." He was one of the meritorious officials depicted in the Yuntai Pavilion. General Feng, who is currently in the Americas, made contributions to the Northern Expedition. He is now nearly seventy years old. Having traveled to the New World, he should be enjoying his remaining years. However, he has repeatedly criticized the domestic situation to foreigners, which is similar to "suing to foreigners." His behavior and words are inappropriate and regrettable. If he had historical knowledge, he should learn from his ancestor Feng Yi, so as not to let "those who learn from Zhang Liang" surpass him in reputation.</p>
<p>Fu Ming made "Righteousness", Yu Zixue made "Loyalty", Zhang can learn from "Liang", Feng does not learn from "Yi".</p>

<h3>Reply to Mr. Qian Qingyun</h3>
<p>I have read your letter. I suggest you seek medical attention for a proper examination. Even if you describe your symptoms in detail in a letter, it is not as clear as seeing them in person. Moreover, inquiries by letter often lack clarity, making it difficult to provide an accurate response. Therefore, asking about illness through correspondence is not a proper method. I hope you will understand! (Editor)</p>
