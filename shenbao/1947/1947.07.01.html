<h3>最高檢署通緝毛澤東　係確定毛爲叛徒　美某大通訊社負責人發表談話</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞記者昨晤本市美國某大通訊社負責人，詢以對最高法院檢察署通緝毛澤東之感想，答謂：此舉之作用，在確定中共爲國家之敵人，毛澤東爲一叛徒，過去予中共之對等地位，因此舉而完全取消，自不失爲一重要之措置。至於直接之影響，則一爲和談之希望更形渺茫，二爲雙方軍事行動將更趨激烈。記者復詢以杜魯門主義是否已推行至我國，某氏答覆爲：截至此時爲止，美政府僅以有限之軍火，滿足中國之需要，故杜魯門主義尚未推行至中國。將來局勢演變，或有此種可能。據本人所知，國務院之對華政策，迄今尚未作最後之決定，對遠東共產主義之侵略亟謀防止，但不知應採取何種方法。以經濟援華而論，建設貸款之希望不大，因建設之收效需時，而中國之局勢則已迫不及待，惟防止通貨膨脹惡化之緊急貸款，則極有可能，但借款必附以監督用途之辦法。</p>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞商界人王曉籟氏對通緝毛澤東發表意見，略謂：通緝較下令討伐爲適宜，因下令討伐不重視中共有對等之地位，而通緝則視之如普通之匪徒。</p>
<h3>主席本週內赴平　張發奎今粵來滬轉京</h3>
<p>﹝本報北平卅日電﹞蔣主席確將於本週來平，約有一週停留。又北平行轅尚未奉關於今年夏都設北平之指示。</p>
<p>﹝聯合社南京卅日電﹞據接近政界方面者稱：預料蔣主席當於一日飛平，此後兩個月中，大部份時間將駐在北平區內，俾於戰事情形更爲密接，並可表示對於華北人民之幸福甚爲在意，惟此訊尚無從向官方證實。北平雖不正式成爲夏都，惟主席留平較久，政府要員之往竭者必衆。此間認爲，主席留駐華北之久暫，當視北平戰局形勢而定。據消息靈通方面稱：主席原擬早日飛平，因國民黨中常會·中政會於卅日下午開聯席會議，將由主席親自主持，決定國策，故展緩離京。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京卅日電﹞據此間關係方面獲悉，廣州行轅主任張發奎，定一日由穗飛滬轉京，晋謁蔣主席，有所請示。</p>
<h3>民盟討論時局　認和談已過去</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞民盟此次連續舉行中常會　次，對時局會慎車商討，但並無結論。對於最高法院通緝毛澤東之決定，亦認爲和解之路已絕，參政會時修改共同綱領以謀重開和談之事，已成過去。民盟過去之斡旋和談，原爲一種適應政治形勢之行動，今日客觀環境已變，當將工作重心置於發展盟務方面。</p>
<h3>緊縮糧政機構　今日政務會將加研討　修正遺產稅草案交財部再擬</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京卅日電﹞政務會議一日例會時，對本年度全國征糧總額將予討論，對緊縮糧政機構事，亦將研討，聞若干征法幣縣份之田糧機構，或將裁撤，東北若干省份田糧機構，或將暫緩設置。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京卅日電﹞修正遺產稅法草案，業經財部擬就，並已送政院核示，聞政院以三千萬元爲起稅點，仍失之過低，已將該草案交還財部再擬。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京卅日電﹞財部直接稅署，爲使加強稅務推行起見，卅日召開座談會，邀集專家及輿論界人士出席，此係因上海商家圖避免繳納所得稅，故召開座談會，出席劉振東·馬星野·簡貫三·陳耀東等廿餘人，王撫洲主席，經討論後，一致認爲滬外商已依法繳納所得稅，國人自更不應逃稅，故主應採查賬辦法，由直接稅署辦理。</p>
<h3>渝中共特務名單　警備部續有發表</h3>
<p>﹝中央社重慶卅日電﹞警備部發表，第四批有事證之中共特務及其同謀者，計鄉村建設學院學生八名，中央工校學生一名，鄉村建設學院係梁漱溟主辦。</p>
<h3>配合中美友好協定　美各州修改法規　規定外人有購置地產權</h3>

<h3>日本戰犯審訊應早結束</h3>
<p>遠東國際軍事法庭，進行中的日戰犯審判，自六月廿七日起，休庭六星期，至八月四日為止。我國法官梅汝嗷，檢察官向哲濬等，在此休庭期間，返國述職。據梅氏抵滬談：外界對遠東國際法庭之審判戰犯，因遲遲不決而感覺不耐，此亦情理之常。在審判過程中，各方面牽連之廣，證據收集之難，有若干出於法官意想之外，使審判情形，趨於複雜。又稱：離東京前，曾由法庭全體法官邀請全體被告律師，商討如領加速進行，庭長且表示年底給束，但能否如願，尙不可知。照梅氏的談話，和最近審判迂緩的情形看來，日戰犯審判，結束時間和宣判結果，都是難於逆料的事。我們關心這一　重大的事，自有再度表示意見的必要。</p>
<p>遠東國際軍事法庭。自開庭以來已有十四個月，甫經證人詰問階段，到現在的辯論階段。日本戰犯東條土肥原等，對受審的辯論，延請辯護日美律師多人，皆法侓權威，一時之選，在辯論中大肆雄辯，事事節外生枝，意圖拖延時間，刷洗暴行，卸去戰犯，實昭然如揭。據報載消息；本月十日，被告律師以「急需時間準備其餘抗辯部份」為理由，正式呈請國際法庭休止開庭六星期，庭長魏勃等受被告律師「疲勞轟炸」影響，早已感覺疲倦，故休北開庭之請提出，卽被庭長准許。很明顯的，被告律師當更乘此空隙，搜集新的抗辯材料，藉以推翻各國檢察官所提之「日本一級戰犯公訴書」，所以八月四日以後的審判，必有新的事態發生，今年能否結束，不僅中國法官梅汝璈難逆料，恐庭長魏勃亦難逆料。至於審判時間延緩，政治意義逐漸消失，將來宣判結果，能否收紐倫堡納粹戰犯結果，恐亦無人可以預測。像這種消失審判目的之審判，英蘇與論已表不滿，吾人素對日本軍閥罪行，觀察深切，亦抱極度的不安。我們認為有若干點，不得不提出來略加中述。。</p>
<p>（一）審判不應拖延，應於和會召集前結束。六月一日本報社論，要求東京法庭，將日本戰犯早日定讞，切不可緩。曾指出：東條·南次郎等之窮凶狡賴，土肥原·松井·梅津等之刁鑽陰狠，決難從審判中獲得徵信的材鷗。而且時間拖延愈對戰犯有利。在法理與事實上，遠東國際法庭的長期審訊，實爲一種不必要的辦法，應迅速修秘訣。現在，麥帥主張速開和會，訂立對日和約，為了消釋盟國不安的心理，增强盟國人士對和約的熱忱，我們希望明快的麥帥，曁魏勃庭長，於審判庭休假期滿後，迅速將審判結束，以便進行和會。如果日本軍閥的罪行，不能及早昭告於世界，任何對日容忍計劃，都難折服盟國人士。</p>
<p>（二）戰犯的定義不可變。去年十一月一日，紐倫堡國際法庭宣佈廿二名納粹重要戰犯的判決書，為國際法學上之重要文獻，具有劃期的學理價値。該項判決書，指控參加下列行為之陰謀，卽為應受絞殺之戰犯：（一）破壞和平之罪行：包括計劃·預備·發動·執行侵略戰爭；（二）戰爭罪行：選犯戰爭的法律或習慣；（三）違反人道之罪行：包括暗殺·屠殺·奴化·逐放國或在戰爭時期前及戰爭時期中，以不人道方法虐待平民；或在政治上宗敎上種族上的虐待。按此項定義，與一九四五年八月，美英蘇法四國共同宣言，決定戰犯定義，大致相同，東京法庭自應援用此「先例」，早日將日本一級戰犯定讞，他如「次級戰犯」違犯上列行為者，不僅要「整肅」，並且各國檢察官應提出公訴，或解送被害國家審判。要這樣，日本軍閥暴行纔能澈底消滅，人類正義公理纔能伸張，國際法「侵略戰爭是罪行」的原則，以及列國的戰犯定義，纔能維持不墜。</p>
<p>（三）侵略中國戰犯引渡中國審判。中國是受日本軍閥侵略危害之重要國家，南京的屠殺，重慶的轟炸，以及各城鎭的殺戮，慘無入道，非被害人直接指控，不能確定犯罪行為之眞實性。因此，我們要求引渡一級戰犯土肥原，梅津，松井等，及在逆顧問影佐一干人犯。我們作此主張，毫無報復心理，而係堅守國際法崇高的原則，及戰犯之正確定義。同時為减少東京法庭人力物力之消耗，這個意見，也值得關係人士參證。</p>
<p>戰爭是政治的延長和繼續，戰犯的定讞，戰罪的確定，纔是戰爭政治意義的告終，當紐倫堡審判納粹戰犯時美總統杜魯門氏宣稱：紐倫堡審判戰犯爲第二次世界大戰最大工作，爲一九四六年大事件之一。杜氏的見地是正確的，所以我們說：東京審判戰犯為一九四七年大事件之一，政治意義是重大的；審判戰犯的結束，纔是戰爭的完全結束，而贏得來的是和平的開始，正義的發展，人類社會安全繁榮的恢復。</p>

<h3>蘇政府訓令抵達巴黎　莫洛托夫提建議　蘇與英法意見背道而馳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎卅日廣播：三外長今日第三次開會，貝文眼皮杜爾站在一方面，莫洛托夫則在另一方面，已臨攤牌階段，若蘇聯堅持美國必須確定援助歐洲之範圍，則會議有破裂可能。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎卅日廣播：三外長今開會，據英廣播公司特派員稱，會講前途黯淡，蘇聯態度頑固，與英法背道而馳。莫洛托夫聲明英法計劃，將侵害歐洲各國利益。</p>
<p>〔路通社巴黎卅日電〕觀察家相信今日之三國外長會議，或將抵達轉捩點。據悉，星期日休會一天，意在使貝文及皮杜爾得有充分時間以研究莫洛托夫關於援歐計劃之建議。莫氏係於接奉本國政府之訓令後始提出此項建議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿九日電〕巴黎三國外長會議，討論馬歇爾之經濟援助計劃，今夜巳因蘇聯表示在美國保證不含有政治作用前，拒不加以贊同，而幾陷於僵局。現三國外長將於明日下午四時舉行第三次會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎卅日電〕英法蘇三國代表團之專家，曾於星期日研究三國外長兩次會談中所提出之各種建議。莫洛托夫想仍在向莫斯科請示中。在莫氏接獲其政府之訓令以前，預料當不能有任何肯定之進展。就最初兩日之會議觀，就政治立塲處理馬歇爾計劃，似尤有距離。但各人似均已準備對實際上之需要，作非政治性之研究。各方懷疑蘇聯代表團將阻礙馬歇爾計劃之恐懼今已消滅。莫洛托夫在週六之會議中曾提出相當具體之建議，使三國代表團在星期日得就三國所提出之建議，予以共同研討。據確息，莫洛托夫確已提出要求美國釋明其未來對歐洲之援助，並保證美國國會得以批准此等計劃之問題。然英法則反對於目前階段即向美國提出此等詢間，認為此舉將造成技巧上之錯誤，而妨最最後目標之完成。另一可能尙未在此次會議中提出之蘇聯　本原則，即為計劃援　之際應以各個國家之需要為基礎，而此等國家並應得在國家完整之主權之下自由處理此等援助。蘇聯在實際立塲上，並不在原則上反對研究歐洲經濟問題之特種狀態。三强會議之尙有成立迅速決議之希望者，即係以此為據。三國專家於研究三國之意見後，對於如何可以成立妥協以設立歐洲經濟設計委員會，大致已可明瞭，彼時貝文即當決定建議設立之機稱是否適應效能上及緊急性之需要。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕關於三國外長連日開會討論馬歇爾國務卿所提出之援歐計劃一事，據接近三國外長會議之人士談稱：巴黎會議雖已發展至因難階段，但英法蘇三國外長明日午後舉行會議時或將改變原來之決定，即不將會議情形保守秘密是也。按三國外長原已成立協議，不將會議之結果發表，但為蘇聯片而所破壞。蘇聯塔斯通訊社意將會議進展之情形予以發表，乃造成一種印像令人相信三國外長會議已陷於僵局。無論如何三國外長會議能獲致協議之希望甚為渺茫。蘇聯立在一方面，英法站在另一方面，英國代表團對於三國外長會議似極悲觀。據某代表談稱：『吾人已至危急階段，吾人之見解與蘇聯之見解截然不同，吾人誠不知三國外長會議將如何結束」。此在法國代表團亦不甚樂觀。按之英法兩國態度，認為德國之需要及其生產能力必須顧及，俾能應付馬歇爾國務卿所提出之建議云。</p>
<h3>對復興歐洲問題美蘇臨攤牌局面</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿九日電〕今日據悉，美國如果從事資助歐洲復興，以制止共產主義蔓延，殊聯顯將採取促使物價飛漲之路綫，以為抵制，此間有資格觀察家對於英法蘇三國外長秘密會議，一致認為根據莫斯科報告之解釋，蘇聯初步行動似在要求美國務卿馬歇爾攤牌，俾確知歐洲各隅擬訂向助計劃時美國究可供給幾許金元，且馬歇爾在美國人民及國會方面有何種後盾，是否僅係空言試探。蘇聯此舉將為國際撲克牌戲之開端，要求馬歇爾放下更多巨額籌碼，而以美蘇在歐洲之領袖地位作賭注。美國政府凖備支持馬氏建議之力量，可於此間籌備歡迎該政府要員二人一事見之。美商務部長哈里曼與農業部長安德森定於七月二日飛抵柏林，率領專家多人研究西歐經濟狀况。其行程包括荷蘭，比利時，法，英及德國。其中除荷比二國外，生活必需品均感奇缺。除荷蘭外，戰後均曾經騐多次政治混亂，今後料將變本加厲。共產主義之威脅濃密籠罩歐洲，蘇聯政治勢力已在車歐與巴爾幹半島邁步前進。</p>
<p>各國對外長會不敢過存奢望</p>
<p>聯合社調查關係各國對巴黎會議反響結果，顯示各該國正以冷淡及悲觀態度注視會議前途。其中德國人民對於馬歇爾計劃能否有具體結果，頗為憂慮。莫斯科會議旣告失敗，對於巴黎會議能否解決經濟問題中之　本歧點，自不能不表示冷淡。義大利人民亦同樣懷疑，據稱，各大國已往未能覓致合作基礎，對於美國此次建議，自亦不敢過存奢望。比利時一般人則信巴黎會議若不能與于蘇聯成立協議，全世界將趨向一次大災難。荷蘭不再需要糧食，但需要建築材料，紡織品及機器。英法二國則因需要工具以生產小麥，煤斤與電力，且需運輸工具，故對馬歇爾計劃均極關切。至於蘇聯，據在莫斯科居留五年之美國某記者宣稱，蘇聯代表參加巴黎會議之目的，無非欲要求蘇聯一向所要求之事物，即德國賠償及共管魯爾區。莫斯科會議對於蘇聯要求德國賠償一百億美元及四國共管魯爾工業區等節，充耳不聞，今將舊事重提。</p>
<h3>教宗贊同馬卿計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社梵蒂岡卅日電〕敎宗今日接見新任英國駐敎廷大使貝羅尼時稱：「應從速實行基於與以前敵人重新建立合作關係之歐洲復興計劃。如若再事拖廷，對於勝利者與被征服者均為不利。」此間人士均認為敎宗之言乃完成贊同馬歇爾計劃之謂也。</p>
<h3>希外長赴美</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿九日電〕聯合國安理會討論巴爾幹調查委會之報告時，希外長葬爾達理斯將親率代表團出席，蔡氏已於今日飛日內瓦轉往紐約。</p>
<h3>國際軍員額問題五強未獲致協議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖卅日電〕今日據悉：聯合國軍事參謀委會今晚可向安理會提出未來國際警備車員額初次正式估計，聞中美英法蘇五國委員未能獲致協議，衆信中美英三國主張國際　備軍員額慶在一百萬至三百萬名之間。蘇聯堅持不宜太多，且應保持各國嚴格均派原則。法國僅願供給步兵一師，據此國際警備軍約共七萬人。</p>
<h3>美加聯防　備凖北極演習</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕陸軍部權威方面頃宣稱：美國與加拿大即將宣佈冬季內聯合舉行北極演習之計劃，防範，可能來自極地方面之進攻，目前美加雙方已在軍事及外交方面實行合作，且自聯防計劃成立後，美國已有大量軍用物資以低價售予加拿大，包括飛行堡壘，坦克車，砲台，運輸交通，醫院等設備在內，美加聯防計有下述各項規定：</p>
<p>（一）互相交換專家，研究對方境內之防務特點。（二）研究共同之計劃，使軍器，設備，組織，訓練等統一化．（三）互惠使用對方境內之陸海空等軍事設備。（四）美國至阿拉斯加途中，開關航空基地，陸上交通及公路綱。</p>
<h3>美國進步公民社　號召組新黨</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿九日專電〕於去年成立而曾受華萊士祝福之「美國進步公民社」，頃要求美國所有獨立政治集團，在來年大　中，於　　進步之總統候選人方面表現合作精神，並「如必要時，當以新黨號召」。按「美國進少公民社」所提組織第三黨之威脅如付諸實施，勢將大形减少杜魯門於來年競選總統中當選之機會，蓋杜氏將因此失去自由左實方面之甚多選票也。</p>
<h3>義總理演說遭左派擾亂</h3>
<p>〔聯合社威尼斯廿九日電〕義大利總理加斯貝里今日在天主教民主黨戶外集會中發表演說，左派共產黨與社會黨羣衆擁人會塲，與警察發生衝突，警長一人與警員十人及示威者甚多因此受傷。加氏於紛擾中繼續演說半小時，向羣衆九千餘人一再　請遵守秩序兼批評共產社會兩黨之偏狹不能容人。及後因衝突無法制止，警察遂使用催淚彈，不意風向突然轉變，烟氣吹向民主黨員所在由警察隔開之聖馬克廣塲，會議始散。</p>
<h3>歐禮和總統　宴請英蘇外長</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕法國總統歐禮和本日在總統府宴請英國外相風文及蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，其他與會者有英國駐法大使特夫古柏，蘇聯駐法大使鮑哥莫洛夫，美國駐法大使喀佛萊，法國外長皮杜爾及法國要員多人。</p>
<h3>美國政府必須領導人民肖滅種族歧視加強民主　杜魯門發表演說強調此點</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕杜魯門總統今日在林肯紀念堂「有色人種福利促進會」第三十八屆年會閉幕會議中致詞稱：美國政府必須在國內領導消滅人民對於種族之偏見及歧視，以加强國外民主運動。州政府及地方政府固應切實保障民權，但全國人民不能再待最落後各州或最頑固社會之聞風而起，而當由聯邦政府為之倡導。美國人民中受侮辱受威脅者為數仍多。美國民族之良心及司法制度仍未能使每個人民取得免於恐懼之完全自由。</p>
<p>國外受兵　各國人民正在生死存亡之綫上掙扎，此等人民對於吾人繼續謀取和平解決世界問題上，關係重大，必須使之接受自由生活方式。欲向各國受苦難之人民敎導自由，良非易事。吾人如不能證明民主之僵越性，則此等人民飢不擇食，極易接受極權政體所引誘之虛偽安全。吾人所倡導之民主運動，必使十分堅强健全。此則須視吾人能先治其國提供切實證據，始克有濟。杜（曾門旋提出下列改善民權保障步驟：（一）去年十二月美國公民中五人所組織之顧問委員會定能為全體國人規定所當奉行之有力合理方案。（二）將請國會通過法案，使關島及蘇馬島人民取得基本民權，共享吾人自由及自治之理想。此舉以及此後一切法案足以示範他國，證明吾人信任全人類均有建設自由出體之能力。總統並稱：聯合國人權委員會愛好自由各國代表正在草擬「國際人權法規」。各國代表有羅斯福夫人等，均屬著名人物，其所擬訂之法規，必為人類爭取自由之長途中一大計程碑。羅斯福夫人總起致詞稱：美國對於黑種人濫用私刑之污點必須剷除，俾使民主得以健全推行。聯合國人民委員會抱定「全人類皆兄弟」之原則，欲建設一種世界，「使全人類皆能生存如兄弟」，則有賴美國之援助。</p>
<h3>聖地調查團　擬赴外約但訪問</h3>

<h3>法破獲政變陰謀　企圖進襲巴黎樹立獨裁政權　高級軍政官員多人被捕</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三十日〕電法國國家安全警察今晨宣布，業已破獲企圖於七月間傾覆法國政府，代以獨裁政權之大規模陰謀。高級軍政官員多人亦與此案有關，惟姓名則並未宣布。陰謀份子最活躍之區域，即勃里泰尼，以及朗員勒北岸等區，調查工作即將完成。此項宣示發表前十二小時，巴黎方面即盛傳將有驚人捕人，宣布戒嚴，及大批閣員辭職之事，據悉，陰謀份子首領之一，為一退伍軍官前貝當之部下，此外法政府官員六七人亦為積極參與此等陰謀者，聞大部份姓名　日即可宣布。據安全警察稱，陰謀者定於七月中旬發動政變，叛軍將自倫納及望納等中心閃電進攻巴黎，奪取各要點，若電話局電報局及弗萊斯納監獄等政治犯將予釋放，叛軍開入巴黎後將設立獨裁政府，並立即施行新法則。安全警察並已獲有代替賴瑪迪政府之叛亂政府之名單，聞此一陰謀係於法國警察於六月廿四日搜查「法國活動週刋」編輯伏爾班之寓所獲得許多陰謀文件後，始被發見，該伏爾班已被逮捕。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎三十日電〕被捕备犯均係右派人土，與戴高光將軍最近組織之法蘭西人民黨無涉。據勃里泰尼城消息，被捕者有退伍軍人國體領袖伏爾班等，黨魁係前貝當元帥友好，警察搜索勃里泰尼某私人住宅時，發現僑政府人名錄與法令及條例草案多種，僭用「五執政內閣」一名，按五執政內閣乃一七九五至九九年法國革命時代依照一七九五年之憲法而組織者。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三十日電〕此間觀察家稱，法國警察發現之推翻政府陰謀案，或有國際關係，並牽涉第一流人物。警察當局今”宣布捕獲前法國憲兵總監吉羅杜將軍，曾根少校，羅特神甫，神甫之住宅中藏有大批軍火。警察搜索此案，開始於六個月之前，至今日始行公佈。此一陰謀之破獲或將完全改變法國之政治局面，預料該案尙有重大發展。</p>

<h3>英商電車停頓半日　全體工人總請假請改善福利事業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商電車公司職工為要求職業保障及改善工人福利，於昨日全體總請假半日，各路有軌無軌電車均未出廠。晨八時並集合七百餘人向社會局請願，提出六點要求，經社會局答覆後，全體職工即於下午二時復工，各路電車恢復行駛。　此次風潮之　結，在於職業保障問題。早於去年八月廿七日，工會曾要求公司如　賣票或可機　　禍或遇有過失時，應仿照法商電車公司辦法，照常發給津貼。以維家屬生活。　交涉遷延至今迄未解決。本年五月二十六日，八路有軌電車駛經大名路時，輾斃行人一名，該車八三八號司機當為地檢處扣押偵查，迄今月餘，尙未釋放。其家屬四口無以為生，向公司交涉，終遭拒絕，繳起職工義憤，終於在臨時召集之緊急會議中，決定遊行請願。</p>
<p>向社局請願</p>
<p>昨晨八時，於赫德路車房集合七百餘人，以國旗及會旗前導，出發遊行請願。自赫德路經靜安寺路，同孚路，霞飛路至社會局。江寗分局派出警察六十名，紅色警備事及吉薈車各二輛維持秩序，並加勸阻。中途請願隊伍曾被衝散二次，但仍繼續前進。十時許隊伍進入社會局廣塲，隨行之紅色警備車亦欲入內，經職工臥地阻止。大隊進入社會後，即在四周張貼標語，並推派代表許士鑑等六人晋見，由勞工處調解科長樊振邦接見。</p>
<p>提六項要求</p>
<p>許代表等當提出六點要求：（一）外勤人員因公肇事，監禁期內工資照付。（二）從速建立勞工子弟學校。（三）員工發給業務上需要之長統靴。（四）飭令資方導照勞資評斷會規定之特別休假及婚喪假期辦法。（五）煤油配給，飭令資方按期配售。（六）復員職工要求恢復原薪及年資。樊科長對第一點要求認為合理，允由社會局向公司交涉。二三五各點為福利問題，允召集勞資商談。第四點為法令間題，由評斷會督促實現。第六點則無法商談。蓋彼輩皆為淪陷時期日人掌握公司時因病無弊，或其他種種過失而遭開革者。勝利後經社會局設法以新工人待遇恢復工作，因其會與敵人發生僱佣關係，過去年資自在不計。樊科長之答覆經工會代理理事長許士鑑轉告工人後，初尙表示不滿，要求取得保證後方肯離去，旋經樊科長及朱順浩等勸導，請願隊伍乃於十二時半離局。下午一時半自公司開出第一輛電車，至二時後各路電車乃全告恢復。</p>

<p>向衆布商，本年二月間在昆經友人介超得識退役空軍王子銘，一見如故，談及上海「土」價高貴，如能設法空運至滬，定能獲得鉅利。王因出身空軍，當即允諾由彼設法機位，於是二人合資六十萬元，在昆南門外民生巷十五號楊申知處，以每兩三萬元之代價，購就雅片廿兩</p>
<p>試行販運，結果頗爲順利，抵滬後張關室中正中路大滬飯店，王則寄居於江陰路九福里卅五號友人家。旋經人介紹得識徐世隆，後由徐介紹將上項雅片以每兩八萬元出售於婦人張林氏，得款一百六十萬元，事後二人平均分配。本年四月張復單獨赴昆販運一次，至上月十六日</p>

<h3>美琪大戲院股東會流會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美琪大戲院，係聯怡公司所經營。上月二十八日，該公司召開股東會，主席報告帳略時，其中會計師律師費用，計達美金二萬一千餘元之鉅，引起各股東責詢，查帳結果，發覺其中律師費一萬八千餘美金，係何挺然（在敵偽時期擅任中聯電影公司常務董事，勝利後被人檢舉）個人所支出費用之一部份。各股東以何化私爲公，擅用鉅款，堅持不允通過，股東會因此宣告流會。聞該公司股票，票面美金三十元，而去年每股僅分得國幣六千七百元以致引起糾紛云。</p>

<h3>處罰戰犯不在報復　國防部通電軍法庭禁槍決前遊行示衆　李良撤職說不確</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日戰犯「常熟之狼」米村春喜及「江陰之虎」下田次郎，於本月十七日槍決時，軍事法庭曾於刑前將兩犯遊街示衆，轟動全市。外傳當局對於此「狼虎遊街」之舉動，因受外文報紙攻擊，故深為不滿，而將該庭長李良撤職，另派南京軍事法庭庭長石美瑜調任，定於今日交替云云。茲悉撤職之說，並無其事，李良庭長自長軍事法庭以來，在經費拮据之艱困情形下，進行戰犯審判工作，成績斐然，現仍照常由持。惟最近國防部因鑒於處罰戰犯目的在於維護人道正義，保障國際法之尊嚴，而不在乎實行報復，故確曾通電全國各地軍事法庭，此後禁止將戰犯在槍決前遊行示衆，並不得在文告書類中引用報復性之語句，如「以快人心」等不當措施云。</p>

<h3>敵僞徵購圈購土地中央修正收回辦法　照百分比按估價償值</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕各地淪陷時期敵偽發價征購或圈購之私有土地，勝利後除政府確有需要得依法征用外，其餘可由原地主購回，其購回方式按照收復地區土地權利淸理辦法第六條之規定，由所有權人提出確切證件，以征收時所領價金按目前物價指數繳價領回。嗣後敵偽產業處理局請准中央，不以物價指數計算，改依金價比例價領回。最近中央對此又有修正，市政府已接獲行政院訓令，對敵人征購圈購之土地，如准由原業主備價領回時，應另按市價重行估定，即將當時業主所受價款算出佔該產業價値之百分比數，再按現時該產業之估價數，以所佔百分比數算出應付價款。例如有土地土塊，在當時估値為二十萬元，而敵偽征購圈購僅付款五萬元，佔百分之二十五。至今該土地估値二億元，以百分之二十五計算之，則原地主應付價款五千萬元，方得領回此地。</p>

<h3>國立中央圖書館積極辦理　出版品國際交換</h3>
<p>半年來國際文化交流日臻昌盛開成東亞溝通國際文化之樞紐</p>
<p>溝通國際學術，樹立文化建設，當以各國互換出版品爲急務。我國自經三十六年一月廿九日行政院核定國立中央圖書館辦理出版品國際交換事項辦法，又於同年四月十九日經行政院通令施行，交換出版品之工作，即逐漸展開，國際文化之交流乃日臻昌盛焉。茲將三十六年上半年度工作情形，摘述於左：</p>
<p>（一）國外出版品之輸入興分發：所有代表各國政府辦理出版品交換之機關，均經備的申請恢復交換關係，總計六十三單位。其中正式參與一八八六年布魯塞爾交換公約者，有比，美，義，葡，中國等共二十六國，非正式參與上項交換公約者，有墨西哥，古巴，俄國等二十三國，其餘未參與上項交換公約之國家，如英國，丹麥等十四國，亦經函請建立交換關係，以期國際文化壁　，得以普遍撤除。計本半年度共收到美國，丹麥，西漢，瑞典等交換處之圖書二〇六箱，五十五包·除新近由美國遝到之廿三箱外，餘均按照各交換處之來文，及包件上所開列我國收件機關，或收件人地址（兩共三二八單位），運送或郵寄，截至六月底止，計整箱運送者一三三箱，啓箱按件彙寄者一六〇一包。尙須整理彙寄者五〇五包。此外，尙有巴西，瑞士，南澳，荷蘭，埃及，薩爾瓦多等交換處寄來我國之大批圖書，頃獲悉已在運輸途中。</p>
<p>（二）國內出版品之徵集與分送：所有國內各級政府機關，及學術團體，均經函請檢寄出版品，並將行政院核定之交換事項辦法鉛印五·〇〇〇份，分送各機關，學校，社團，藉備參考。雖有以復員未了，或以經費困難，一時未能檢寄書刋，但本半年度仍能收到依法檢送之岡書一三二種，三·二八八册，合特約圖書共五八八種，七·一五一册。依法檢送之定期出版品三六九種，一·二五九一份，計檢送上項出版品者，政府機關佔二九九單位，敎育文化學術團體佔一〇一單位。以地域論，邊遠省份檢送出版品之機關，僅及總數五分之一。至於出版品到處經登錄後，即按各國交換單位，及其所需我國出版品之性質，分別列架。除包件按時郵寄各國外，几須裝箱運往國外者，至少每兩月一次。截至六月底止，運往國外之出版品，計三〇箱，（內有八箱正在向海關與中央銀行洽運中）。郵寄國外者，計七二七包。以國別計，運往美國者二四箱，遝往英國者三箱，澳洲一箱，蘇聯二箱。</p>
<p>（三）交換工作之展開：（1）凡國內外政府機關與學術團體之特殊申請事項，均為分別辦理。在國內方面，如經濟部商標局，國防部史料局，上海市財政局，浙江省銀行等，各以其出版品商由交換處代為向國外有關機關治商交換同性質之書刋。在國外方面，致函申請者較多。茲舉其重要者，有美國國務院索贈我國政府報告，統計，及各大學學報，及研究報告等出版品，自勝利復刋號起檢贈全份。一部份業已交由美國學術處設法空運美京。因是，中國官書，在美國將藏有二套，（另一套為美國國會圖書館所入藏）。巴塔維亞中央統計局索贈有關統計及社會經濟之岡書與期刋，匈牙利非郎荷甫東亞藝術博物院在此次大戰中受損甚鉅，特致函索贈中國藝術雜誌，藝術字典·藝術史，以及安陽發掘報告，及安陽文物圖錄等，均為分別辦理。（2）與國外各著名大學岡書館建立交換關　　例如與哥倫比亞大學，哈佛燕京學院，夏夷威大學，以及秘魯聖瑪珂大學等，均與中國交換處開始互換書刋。此外檢贈西澳大學四庫珍本一部，購贈英國劍橋大學晚晴　詩匯，平津館叢書等。頃又由斯蒂芬加爾敎授來函，獲悉有達佩斯大學之中國學院，在此次大戰中被毀，為恢復計，中國自當予以協助。</p>
<p>（四）譯輯新書書目與岡書摘要：（1）為使國外學術機關及學者個人，明暸中國出版情况及選購或交換中國圖書方便起見特譯輯新書選目，內分岡書與期刊兩部，均於譯名之後附英文解題及出版年，出版地，出版者，價格等項，按季刊於國立中央岡書館出版之英文期刋書林季刋。按該刋出版，不及一年，於國際學術方面，即形成一大貢獻，除紛紛函請交換與訂閱外，斯蒂芬加爾敎授特為向匈牙利新聞及匈牙利廣播電台報導，藉廣宣傳。（2）中國出版品，每以文字困難而使國外學人感覺不便，如伯敏罕公共岡書館，牛津大學圖書館，牛津大學植物園岡書館，皇家倫敦昆蟲學會等，均請於檢寄出版品時，附寄英文摘要一份，以期易於了解。</p>
<p>由上所述，國立中央岡書館出版品國際交換處，代表政府辦理出版品交換，而將形成東亞溝通國際文化樞紐之一，然以經費不裕，尙未能充份發展。</p>

<h3>防止套利及資金逃避　國行緊縮華南匯款　對於商業行莊每週限匯五千萬　中國銀行亦停止普通商業匯款</h3>
<p>華南以走私關係，內漲匯率，時起劇烈之波動，在中央銀行控制之下，會收平抑之效，惟華南終因情形特殊，內匯率之上漲，近益變本加厲。商業行莊之匯率，上過五每千即達二百八十元之高峯，而廣州等地之匯率，國家行局亦早已提至九十五元之記錄，已不能再事增高。此次匯率之波動，其最大原因，仍由走私及資金洮渡香港所致。因官府匯率與商業行莊匯率相差過鉅，已發生套利現象，如由國家行局匯至華南，每千萬元可獲利百　萬之利潤。中央銀行有鑒及此，昨日(卅日)起已規定各商業行莊匯往廣州福建兩省地區之款項，每過以五千萬為限。分次或一次匯出均可，超出五千萬以外，一概拒絕。國家行局庫，亦同時緊縮商業匯款。中國銀行方面，昨日（卅日）已停止普通商業匯款，抵制於匯作生活費用，至多以兩百萬為限。國家行局之此項措施，全為防止資金之逃避，及不含商人之套利。將來情況好轉，再恢復平時辦法。</p>
<p>又國家行局庫匯往各地匯率，已加修正，廣東區全為九十五元，福建區廈門已由八十元增為九十五元，福州已由五十元增為八十元，廣西區由六十元增為八十元，湖南區長沙衡陽兩地由四十元增為四十五元，江蘇區連雲港新浦東台等處，由二十元增為廿十五元，湖北區漢口武昌由卅五元增為四十元。沙市宜昌及其他各地，每千由四十元增為四十五元。山東區青島由五元增為廿元，其他各地由五元增為十元。其他各地由卅元減為廿元，陝西區由十元減為五元，其餘均無變動。</p>

<p>經紀人均表失望</p>
<p>證交經紀人方面，昨對財經兩部新批示，頗表失望，認為遞交新措施，將使正常交易減少，正當經紀人之業務，反無法開展。而黑市及場外交易，將鏡趨活躍。惟一般觀察，認為政府規定該項新措施，自亦有其不得已之苦衷，現經紀人首腦方面，正交換意見中，希望從合法之手緞，請求政府再予變通之考慮云。</p>

<h3>現棉交易清稀</h3>
<p>昨日現棉交易清稀，場內甚形沉寂，紗廠以棉紗議價恢復後，成本大受限制，吸冐甚微。賣戶鑒於現棉存底不多，不願曉售。同時六底結息關係，貨款不能立刻抵用，故成交甚少。午後做開漢口細絨機交價一八四萬，靈寶一九五萬至二〇五萬，周浦籽花每担二六萬五千至二八萬五千，又送廠價僅靈寶略有成交，價為二一二萬。</p>
<h3>茶葉成交不旺</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕中信局麵粉五千包，昨裝招商局海南輪，運往天津，近茲以來由滬運津之商貨，逐漸減少，大約因華北時局關係。</p>
<h3>呢羢價均堅俏</h3>
<p>毛織品呢羢行情，近因香港扯價報昂，轉運抵滬者稀，本廠貨則定價高於現貨之上，同時受物價紛漲影響，呢羢始終堅固，賣買雙方均看前途向榮。至銷路方面，迎來本客幇俱見稀微。</p>
<h3>棉紗議定新價後　紡建開始準備配紗　七月上半月預定配二萬件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會自昨日公布實施共同配銷制後，即由中國紡建公司辦理配紗手續，照新錢價配紗。（各支紗配價詳見下刊商情欄）。配紗對象，付款手續，均仍照紡建原定辦法辦理。昨日紡建掛牌，改稱為紡織事業調節委員會聯合配紗。昨日各複製業申購單共三〇七強，經核配各支紗共五三〇件。紡調會雖稱，昨已接到各民營廠繳紗共一千餘件，惟紡建公司尚未接到開紗機單，故昨日所核配之紗，仍全部係園紡建所售出。</p>
<p>聞紡調會此次舉辦共同配銷制，七月份上半個月，暫定配紗總額為二萬件，內國營民營紗廠各佔半數。按紡調會所公布制共同配銷制辦法規定，所有國營民營紗廠之產紗，應統歸紡調會掌握，共同議價，共同配銷。惟民營廠方面，則希望共同議價，個別配銷。荒民營廠仍斤斤於各廠自身之老戶頭，如產紗統歸共同配銷後，對民營廠營業之自由，不無影響。關於此點，刻紡調會與民營廠，仍　商辦法中。</p>
<p>昨據紡調會發言人談稱：在共同配銷制實施後，（一）此後國營民營紗廠之售紗交易，概須經紡調會核准。（二）配售對象，以實用戶為主。（三）此後國營民營紗廠之產紗，統歸紡調會掌握，由會委托紡建公司代為配銷。據告：前紡管會存紗一千二百餘件，業已移交本會接收。又民營各紗廠，於卅日已有各支紗一千餘件繳送到會，俾供共同配銷之需云。</p>
<h3>煤市緊俏</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤貨主依然觀望，市勢仍為緊俏。僅少數貨主因値六底，為銀根所迫，逢高略有脫出，白煤行市喊價紊亂，尤以高檔貨焦作節塊，供求均缺，成交價在二百十萬元至二百二十萬之譜。焦煤行市漲勢較緩，到貨亦多，銷路頗為活躍。煤球廠盤因工料日漲，各廠業已相繼調整售價，大廠每噸六十六萬元，小廠六十萬元，然因時値淡月，銷路故為清淡。柴碳步煤市後塵，行盤疾升。</p>
<h3>台灣碱業繁榮　產量冠於全國</h3>
<p>（中央社高雄卅日電）台灣碱業日趨繁榮，目前產量冠於全國。該公司總經理方以矩稱：該公司現擁有高雄台南安平三廠，主要產品為燒碱、鹽酸、漂白粉等，應用至廣。目前固體燒碱月產三百噸，鹽酸一百噸，漂白粉二百噸，其他各種用品，亦均較接管時期增加兩倍　。現國內各地需碱孔股，來台搜購。該公司出品，除部份供應當地肥皂紙業煉油製鋁各工廠外，自今年四月至今，湛颶配銷者，已達六百噸。以每噸台幣卅萬元計，即達一億八千萬元，但仍感供不應求。</p>
<p>方氏續稱：台省水電　產及石灰各項原料，既多且廣，發展碱業條件，最為優越。今後計劃厥為增產，該公司鹽田已修復者二千五百畝，在修復中者七千畝，年底將有一萬畝鹽田可供利用。又擬於高雄另行籌建新廠，向美訂購新式電機及工場機械，預計完工之日，每月可產固碱千噸，鹽酸六百噸，漂白粉五百噸。</p>
<h3>聯總運華棉花　廠商可以棉紗交換　二十支紗一件易棉花七六〇磅</h3>
<p>聯總配華棉花，截至本年六月十八日為止，已有一二七，八六八包運抵中國，其中六一，四八四包，業經行總按照前紡管會所規定分配額，分別以每担國幣七四五萬元之價格，配售與三十二家紡織工廠。現各倉庫尚存有棉花六六，三八四包，行總為繼續配售是項棉花，及避免因配棉價格增加而影響其他物價上騰起見，乃決定採取交換辦法，凡已獲得聯總棉花配額之廠商，得根據外棉七六〇磅交換重四〇〇磅之二十支棉紗一件比率，向行總申請訂購。該新辦法已呈請行政院及經濟部備案，行總並於本星期內通知各廠商，前往洽商簽訂合同。</p>
<h3>橫濱正金銀行　宣告閉門</h3>
<p>（合衆社東京三十日電）日本最著名之橫濱正金銀行，已於三十日宣告關門。該銀行於戰前為日本在海外金融之主要代表機關，已有六十八年歷史。自日本政府正式公佈重建日本金融　　之戰後措施後，該銀行實際已入關門狀態。</p>
<h3>五月份僑匯銳减　僅一百零五億元　較四月份少去百分之五十</h3>
<p>中國銀行經辦之僑匯，因官訂外匯匯率與黑市差額過大，已显每况愈下之勢。頃據該行發表五月份僑匯收入，美洲、歐洲、南洋等處之總額，僅為一百零五億三千六百六十六萬六千七百三十一元三角六分。四月份為二百零七億餘元，已减少百分之五十。僑匯逃避情形之嚴重，由此可知。</p>
<p>六月份據各方報告，又復大减，恐不及五月份之半數。南洋方面幾已絕跡，均逃避香港，僑匯匯往香港後，即將匯票帶至廣州出售，一般商人購進後，即再寄國外購買物資，此為已漸公開之事實。</p>
<p>至五月份收入之僑匯，仍以紐約為多，為七十七億九千五百四十一萬九千一百八十六元，其次為古巴之夏瀕拿，為十億零八千七百六十二萬八千七百元，其次為倫敦，計二億三千另四十八萬一千九百三十七元三角七。</p>
<p>其餘為數不大，澳洲之雪梨，計一億六千五百零八千四百四十九元。印度之加爾各答，為一億二千四百另八萬五千八百卅六元三角五。仰光為六千二百七十七萬六千元，新加坡為五百一十九萬元，吉隆坡為一百一十七萬三千六百元，檳榔嶼為五百卅七萬元。安南之西貢，計兩千另四十八萬二千五百另四元五角二，荷印之巴達維亞，為九億一千元。國外代理店為一億二千九百另五萬另五百十八元一角四。合計為一百零五萬億三千六百六十六萬六千七百卅一元三角云。</p>
<h3>台鳳梨外銷活潑　美商紛紛來訂貨</h3>
<p>台省特產鳳梨，又至夏季收獲時期。按本省鳳梨種植面積，最盛時超出一萬公噸，收獲生果十四五萬噸。其中百分之六十製成罐頭，外銷最高達一六〇萬箱。戰前出品與夏威夷新嘉坡齊名，而夏新兩地均受此次大戰影響，產量大减，供不應求。本省鳳梨公司最近曾迭據美國商人派員來台訂貨，該公司鳳梨罐頭外銷極見活潑。</p>
<h3>進口附加稅　繼續徵一年</h3>
<p>據江海關當局佈告：關於進口貨物，按海關稅徵收百分之五之附加稅，原定六月底停止徵收。茲經決定於本日（七月一日）起，繼續徵收一年云。</p>
<p>木材平穩</p>
<p>近日來木材尚稱平穩，洋杉昨有到埠，約計百餘萬尺，杉木價稍軟疲，洋松價八千元左右，杉木約三千元，若無意外愛動，市况恐將長期盤旋。</p>
<h3>本年五個月　行莊存款統計</h3>

<h3>陳茶收購問題　中信局在會商中</h3>
<p>收購卅五年度陳茶，當局雖一再表示決心辦理，惟迄今仍無下文。昨據關係方面消息，滬市各茶商　由中農介紹央行告貸之茶葉押款，已於本月三日滿期，然於茶葉普遍不景氣之今日，商民實無法歸還，故政府對於陳茶收購，勢在必行。聞中信局與中國聯營茶葉公司負責人，刻正在商討收購價格為祁紅每担七十二萬元，屯綠六十六萬元，平綠四十八萬元，茶商以此項價格，尚係數月以前確定，目前物價已高漲數倍，要求普遍增加百分之廿云。</p>

<h3>餘姚鹽場去來</h3>
<p>— 杭州六月廿七日快訊　本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>像一把扇面攤開在杭州灣的南岸，一片連接着海天的廣漠的平原，泥土終汎着白色，辦便是東南地歐　鹽最大的供應地——餘姚鹽塲·這佩地區以庵東爲中心，包括七個鄉鎮，有十萬人口，在行政上是勝於餘姚的，但由於過去幾百年來鑒政的專制，鹽民唯知有塲長而不知右縣長。最近，鹽民的戶口雖已向縣政府登記了，位仍不失其特殊的性質。記者爲了要明瞭這個浙東產豐區底現狀起見，到了餘姚之後，就由趙秘書等陪同前往豐塲參觀。</p>
<p>中心地帶庵東</p>
<p>從餘姚乘吉普車北行七十里，約四十分鐘，就到了鹽塲中心地——庵東。這裏有一條大街，和普通江南的市鎭一樣，是很窄的。除了固定的商店外，還有以攤販爲中心的市集，市面是很繁榮的。物價則較餘姚城裏貴。因爲生活程度的髙昂，工資也比別地大，據說在其他鄉鎮請老婆婆唸佛，每天供膳外，僅五百元，而在豐塲裏，却要三千元一工。</p>
<p>據餘姚豐塲的塲長在挺吿訴記者，鹽塲東西長七十里，南北廣十五里，因受杭州灣水流變遷的影響，逐漸北移，豐塲公署是民國五年北遷至庵東的。全區廣可九萬九千畝，戰前有鹽板七十三萬塊（其中官板五十五萬塊）年產食鹽四百八十萬担，佔浙江全省產量十分之六，和山東，兩淮，長蘆共稱四大　塲。民國卅年四月淪陷後，敵人築竹離包圍鹽區，統制食鹽，使自由浙江及贛東，皖南等地民食恐慌。一面更加緊剝削，那時鹽民終年無米可食，僅以蕃薯，雜糧爲爲餐。有些鹽戶，拿了床，桌等傢俱上城出賣後，繩些糙米回家煮粥，就以爲是最大的奢侈了！鹽民之苦，即此可見。勝利後，政府復員，始稍解鹽民的困苦。據統計，現有鹽戶五千八百廿二戶，共約六萬人，鹽工二萬一千人。共有鹽板五十三萬九千六百八十塊，較戰前少多，因此鹽產亦就說减，去年僅收二百萬担，今年可產二百十萬担。所產食鹽，供應本省卅一縣一市，每年約七十萬担，供銷江蘇者，每年六十萬担，供應贛東者，每年約二十萬担，供應皖南者，每年約十二萬祖。</p>
<p>鹽民財產鹽板</p>
<p>因爲杭州灣的海水比較淡，所以餘姚鹽塲的製鹽方法和兩淮，山東都不同。他們是利用土裏的鑒質製成鹽滷，然後再曉的，所以比起由海水直接晒製，成本是髙多了。鹽塲的土地，說起來都是公的，但實際上却有私機的存在。而這些地主是以鹽板的多　爲財產的，鹽民租地製鹽，也是以鹽板的數字來計算租價。普通一塊鹽板的租費，是年付七十斤到一百斤的食鹽。這和地主征收租穀一樣。所以鹽民的地位正和普通農村中的佃農一樣。而絕大部分民，都是這一類的一佃農」是租板晒緊的。鹽民租了鹽板後。就「靠天吃飯」，用「括，淋，攤，晒，」的程序，製成雪白的食鹽，去換取黄白色的穀米。他們的蕊本　備，是在白地（即鹽地）的一角，築一土堆，上扒一圓坑，下鋪穩草，名爲「漏碗」。這種涮碗的底部連一竹管通到旁邊把身體埋在泥中的木桶裏。製鹽時，須先把含立有鹽質的泥土括起來，然後扒集了倒在涮碗裏，再用海水灣　。一二小時後，泥土中的鹽質和海水相容就變成舟滷，通過竹管盛到太桶裏。滷的好壞（即所含碱性的濃淡），是用一種裝有三粒至五粒木蓮子底竹匙，和普通酒館油店裏量酒或汕用的差不多，祇是更組糙些。把這個匙裝滿滷，如果木蓮都浮起來，那便是最好的。然後，把滷運到晒塲上，倒在聯板上曝晒，讓水份蒸發。鹽板是長方形的，長約六，七尺，闊約三尺，四周釘上髙可二寸的木條，使水不外流。如果陽光强，三四小時候，便可看到鹽一板上已是一片雪白的鹽了。</p>
<p>每日產鹽萬担</p>
<p>鹽民是「靠天吃飯」的，因爲他們的生產是完全依賴自然，仰靠天時的。春，冬二季，（大約是十二月至次年的五六月間）鹽塲裏的泥土多潮濕，鹽分吸收的不多；而且陽光也比較弱，水分蒸發的時間增長，所以產量銳减，這個時期，鹽民呌淡產期。過了六月，就是旺產期了，夏秋二季白地較乾，易於吸收鹽分；而陽光强，晒製易，產量大增，記者去參觀的時候，已每天可產到一萬担了。但還未達到頂點，天愈熱，產量也愈多。普通一塊鹽板，平均每年可產三百斤，記者曾訪問一個鹽戶、六口之家，租六十塊鹽板，每年可獲鹽一萬八千斤；以每板七十斤的租費，須繳四千二百斤，剩下來的，以現價每担二萬九千元計算，則可獲四百萬零二千元；除了百分之二·五的福利捐（約十萬元）平均每月約三十萬元，雖還可勉强吃飯度日，但如果要修理或添置鑒具，那就得改吃一點雜糧了。至於　塲裏的地主們，則和農村裏的一樣，是很舒服的，他們不用製鹽而且很少住在鹽塲裏，每年住在城一裏專靠收鹽租過活。據說最大的地主擁有鹽板一萬塊以上，如果以較低的每板七十斤的租額計算，他每年可收鹽七十萬斤，即每年可獲二百億以上的鉅利（照現價）、這不是比別的大企業更易掙錢嗎？他祗要做變塊鹽板便好了，連生產工具都是鹽民自備的。</p>
<p>生產大受限制</p>
<p>那麽，爲什麽不多做些鹽板呢？這已是今日鹽民與鹽塲公署的重要爭論之一。抗戰以來，餘姚鹽塲損失鹽板十七萬塊，產量和戰前低落一半！而鹽民是有儘多的餘力來從事鹽產的，那末爲什麽驅塲公署不讓增加鹽板呢？據汪塲長說是爲了避免生產過剩，產量太多，無法運銷，全國可產鹽凡四千四百萬担，面僅銷三千四百萬担，餘姚鑒成本較大，幸已滯銷百萬担。但這個解釋，我們也難以滿意，因爲曉在工業和國防原料上，係佔極重要地位。我國工業雖落後，但如染色廠的定包，製皂廠的水離機，造冰廠的减低溫度，做硝皮，製乾電池，……等，無一不需要大量的鹽。戰前年產四百八十萬担，今年僅可產二百十萬担，爲什麽要限制生產呢？現在盥的從生產到消費的過程，雖已由「民製，官收，官運，官銷」改變到「民製，官收，商運，（或官託商運）商銷」，但如果放棄統制，再令改變到自由經銷的狀態，也許更有助於鹽產和鹽民的生活吧！</p>
<p>千鹽石米請願</p>
<p>不久以前鹽民曾向省，並晋京請願，要求「千鹽有米」（以一千斤員換一百五十斤米）的鹽價，這個問題，到現在尙未完全解決。復員初期，每担鹽價二百元，到去年底已達四千元。經請顧後，原則上答應要求，而由鹽民及工會議價後，每月經鹽塲公署核定。現在每担二萬九千元，而米價則僅廿三，四萬元，故已超出要求。有一個和男人一樣工作的鹽婦，指着鍋裏的熱飯，用一種非常自滿而喜悅的聲音，吿訴記者：「現在三餐都可以吃飯了」。我看了看，雖然是黄糙米，而且是很簡陋的小菜，但他已歡　得不得了，感激得不得了，鹽民的要求，本來是很低的，而且也很合理的。不過，現狀的滿意是暫時的，它可能隨着物價的變動而變動起來，汪塲長說：「根據政府油令，鹽必須由政府統制，鹽民必須將生產所得的鹽，繳給政府人倉，而由政府予以「生產貸款」。現在的生產貸款是照市價全數發給；但旺產期內，因貸款不敷，將先付數成。而且主張在淡產期，因鹽民生產少，應提髙鹽價爲「千鹽石米」；但在旺產期，則產量已足，應减爲「千鹽百米」。但據鹽業產業工會的書記韓師周說：「實際上鹽產和運銷的盛襄是相反的，淡產期即旺銷期；旺產期即淡銷期。所以鑒塲公署的核價標準是不合理的。而且鹽民不知有生產貸款，唯知有緊資。他們拿了鹽賣給政府，就得收回鹽資，回家買米來吃。所以公署如要尅扣鹽資，則於情於理，對鹽民都是說不過去的」。因此鹽價問題正潛伏着波浪，現在警民就是希望鹽塲公署取消核價政策，以免物價波動時受其約束，而被迫再吃山芋湯，沒有飯吃。</p>
<p>篷長改名倉長</p>
<p>鹽務行政機構方面，也頗値我們注意。從前篷長制度的時代，鹽民的經濟完全操在篷長的手裏。鹽民挑了鑒繳上去，明明是一百斤的，他秤過後說祇有八十斤，就是八十斤。如果他要說鹽是黑色的，鹽民也沒辦法，當付鹽資，（也就是說：放生產貸款）的時候，他把　資扣起來，祇發幾成，或竟緩浚；而自己拿去做生意，或轉手放髙利貸給鹽民，拿了鹽民的汗血錢去剝削鹽民，鑒民的痛苦，可想而知。然而鹽民是善良的，他們之中十分之九是紹典人，十分之一是餘姚本縣人，幾百年來，他們就負着生活的重担，苦苦地延續他們底生命。燕有民國十六年，累積了的重壓暴發了他們底無可容忍的憤怒，結果鹽警開槍，死傷數百人。勝利後經鹽民和產業州工會力爭，　務公署總算改善了不少，放棄工　長，改稱倉長，鹽民方面，聞已請求實行民主的「倉長民選」並且祇希望能有自已的代表監　也就滿意了。</p>
<p>築成七塘圍墾</p>
<p>餘姚鹽地由於海水潮流影響，逐漸北張，因此到某一時期原有白地，因離海更遠，鑒產銳减，所以就得築塘圍墾，種植棉或其他宜種之植物。大約經過一百年左右，就得就築一塘，現在已做到七塘，記者從餘姚驅車北行，歷經一塘二塘至新塘，塘與塘間，不是種稻，便已種棉植麥，一無鹽塲痕跡，滄海桑田，變遷殊大，茅屋土墳並列，不禁要嘆人生之無常了。七塘是去年十二月開工興築的，長達十五公里，計卅二萬土方，已完成百分之八十五，約六月底可完成。塘成後，塘內一二年後即不能出產鹽，所以如何去戲養淡是鹽民的急要任務。而鹽塲公署築塘後，遲遲未開洞，水不能出，以致鹹性不除，無法種植；而白地水積鹽水不能晒，塘內二萬五千畝地未受其益將蒙其災，故　民對記者談起塘的問題，莫不萬愁交集，一旦到了這二萬五千畝白地眞不能產鹽種棉的時難，鹽民將何以爲生呢？我希望鹽務當局能處處替鹽民們謀求目前和未來的福利才好，不要把他們推開了！</p>

<h3>中原碧血</h3>
<p>— 開封廿四日航讀　徐勁</p>
<p>中原是中國文化的馳濕地，但現在却成了一片角逐塲，不惟難以尋到文化的氣息，則使是一些自然的景物，也因砲火的震憾破滅改了期，我們不必遠　更長的　　，自民國二十七年敵人鐵歸路進河南，老百姓即沒有遇一天的安穩日子，黄河把豫東大部冲刷個乾凈，人民生命　產的　　，至今尙是一件難以統計的數字。民國三十一年的旱災，又　浦南遺成一個恐怖的局面，軍根，樹皮，島　，鹽　土，都成了人民主要的食料，甚至有些更懷慘更離奇的事，　平爲　　歷甚境者不敢相信。民國卅三年中原陷敵，河南幾怎一片乾凈土，老百姓在水深火然中過活，但他們毫無一點怨尤，惟一的希望是把鬼子趕出公能過平安的日子。</p>
<p>自中共開閉了和談之門以來，河南又陷入漫天烽火中。飽經憂患的人民，又怎能受得了這樣的折磨？政府負有保國衛民的責任，不能不管人民的死活，因此地方政府與共軍間，便發生尖銳的衝突，而演出種種悲壯的事蹟。元月卅一日的夜間劉伯誠部萬餘人由柘城竄向鹿邑，當時守城的團隊統共不過千餘人縣長孫敬軒接到報吿後，立即在城內部著並抱定與城共存亡的決心。其初尙以聞到稀落的槍聲，後來愈來愈密集，聲音也震耳欲聾，砲火在空中飛過，於星光下更顯得明亮。</p>
<p>一夜的時間渦去了。第二天的淸晨，共匪的砲火打的更激烈，然而遺我軍不斷的反擊，城外共匪遺屍遍野。雙方正在激烈戰鬥中，不幸的事就在這時發生。大王廟的守軍，突然全部叛變西關遂吿失守。過午以後共匪即由西關集中砲火猛攻西門在砲火猛烈的發繫下，西門全被摧毀，共軍也就乘隙蜂湧入城當與守城部隊發生巷戰，雙方反復肉搏了二小時，終因衆寡懸殊，守城部隊遂吿不支孫縣長就在彈盡援絕後被俘，同時被俘的尙有二區集訓總一隊長汲壽彭與縣自衛隊長王應亭。自此以後，孫縣長即開始絕食，並閉口不與共匪談話，共匪爲洩私忿，遂將孫縣長帶至城西南雙樓集殺害。聞孫縣長是商邱人，現年三十九歲。會在北京大學讀過書，在抗戰期間，曾任豫東游擊司令，抗敵肖衛司令，旅長，副師長等職。勝利後始任鹿邑縣長。</p>
<p>柘城縣在豫東也是共匪經常竄擾的縣份。路縣長傳芝在民權縣長任內。共匪圍攻縣城路縣長以少數國隊，與共匪萬餘苦鬥十六晝夜，卒將共匪擊退，因此造成豫東輝煌的戰績。三月六日，金紹山部千餘突向城郊襲擊，當時即發生激烈戰鬥，不過我方於新挫之餘，尙未補充齊全，又遭攻擊，實在感覺不支，於苦戰後，即突圍到達嶺子楊，（城東北）整頓部署。然而路縣長滿腔怒火，難以壓制，乃於當夜，復率隊攻入縣城，與奸匪混戰了一夜，將共匪殺傷甚多。路縣長爲减少犧牲，乃又突圍轉移至城東北鄢莊，準備待機反攻，不料喘息未定，共匪又追踪而至，將鄂莊團團包圍，路縣長即率殘部抵抗，終於彈舉援絕後壯烈殉職。</p>
<p>又一件不幸的事發生在睢縣，三月八日得到共匪攻城的消息。　　來犯共　　金紹由　及王其梅等部共約五千餘人而守城部隊僅有省保安第六縱險及縣自衛隊，兵力懸殊甚大。晚七時許，全城即爲共軍包圍，當夜一連七次猛攻縣城，賴殷縣長及楊總隊長分別督飭據守，卒未獲逞。十日晨砲火益爲激烈因天已亮，目標顯然；城內工事悉爲匪砲火摧毁，官兵亦大部傷亡，而彈藥本將吿罄；正當這個時候，共軍乘隙入城，團隊與共軍遂白刃相接，這時戰鬥的激烈，可謂已達頂點，我方園隊傷亡殆盡，縣城遂吿陷落，在混亂狀態中，殷縣長照楊總隊長均被俘。</p>
<p>共匪也知道殷縣長是一位强幹的人，所以就想盡方法誘他入夥，可是他們却不知道殷縣長堅貞不屈的精神，雖一再引誘，皆經嚴詞拒絕，不爲所動。後來就有數千民衆，向共軍請朮將殷縣長釋放，他們知難達到目的，乃於三月十六日，將殷縣長送交奸匪第一軍分區司令部，又勸他捐款獻田撫邱已死的奸匪家屬，但殷縣長仍不予接受，並要求速死，因而遇害。股縣長在睢縣很受人民愛戴，現在睢縣的父老們尙時時的含着淚，懷念着他。</p>
<p>最痛心的，莫過於寗陵縣長胡　的　。事賓發生於四月三日晚一時，共匪以五個團攻城，首光城西南發現塲聲，頃刻間，城周團槍聲響成一片。胡縣長能度鎭靜，一方從容指揮作戰，一方深沉的硏究對策。不過守城的武力，僅有國軍一營，及兩個自衛中隊，總共不過五百人，的確是一件艱鉅的任務。城外的會聲愈來愈緊急，胡縣長即親冒砲火指揮作戰，士氣極爲旺盛，經過澈夜的激戰，嚴斃奸匪無算，惟以彈　援絕，也漸漸的轉入頹勢。四日拂曉，情况益趨嚴重，槍聲亦較前更州爲激烈，城內各據點多被奸匪攻佔，負傷官兵亦陸續的抬下來，滿城已爲砲火籠罩。胡縣長爲求便於指揮，以策萬全，遂興楊總隊長移於寗陵縣長張議長宅中，這時共匪因佔有城內各據點，氣熖更爲髙漲。胡縣長知大勢已去，無法倖存，乃慷慨賦詩，書於張議長宅市肇上，其詞爲：</p>
<p>請君何必淚潸潸？</p>
<p>取義成仁在此關。</p>
<p>華表柱頭千載後，</p>
<p>忠魂依舊到民間。</p>
<p>胡縣長題完了詩，砲聲愈發密集，也正在這個時候，共匪如蜂湧般的攻進城來，巷戰了二小時，團隊死傷殆盡，楊總隊長旋被俘虜。　縣長憂心如焚，遂便服價入一屠戶家中，欲覓利刃自殺，可是遍覓不見，在萬分緊急中，忽然發現一隻紡棉花的鐵錠子，胡縣長就握緊這枝鐵錠，向着自己的頭部猛刺，當即昏絕於地。嗣即爲共匪發現，看見他還有些氣息，欲蔣他抬見照曾邀功。當抬到南門外的時候，奸匪業已出城他云，他們看見胡縣長頭破血流的樣子，不惟毫無同情，並且愈增忿恨，遂用槍對準頭部射擊，當即殞命。他們把屍身推到城河裏面，方才蜂　而去。事後民衆聞知，把屍身由城河中撈出來，並　資備棺，浮屠於寗陵城南門左側。</p>
<p>豫北在拉戰期間淪陷最早，八年來已爲敵人搞的不成樣子，現在自黄河改道後，共匪欲打淹所謂晋豫魯走廊，已成他們拼命力爭的地方。老百姓在他們看着不過是一種工具，地方受他們　災害，眞是一件難以形容的事　，現在豫北戰事猶在漫延着，老百姓渴望政府解救的心情，猶如大旱之望雲霓。</p>

<h3>追踪張季直先生的志業與精神</h3>
<p>— 張淵揚</p>
<p>南通張季直先生，是近代中國啓蒙運動中最偉大而有功績的事業家，其在事業上輝煌的成就，是淵源於其祟髙獨特的志業和精神的。我們要繼續並發楊南通先生的事業與精神，必先認識其志業與精神上特點之所在。茲特敬就管窺所及，折述南通先生的事業抱負及其精神表徵於次，以就教於多數景仰先賢的時賢。</p>
<p>一·南通先生的事業抱負</p>
<p>第一，南通先生的事業，是由私及公化私爲公的。他的事業進行，似乎總循着一定的綫索和進程。先實業，次敎育，再繼之以慈善·公益，以及軍事·政治。實業是私人經營的的事業，而敎育·慈善等等就是服務公衆的事業了。即以實業·敎育而論，開辦時是私家經營的，接着就做成公司或董事會的組織而奉獻大衆，公諸社會了。他無疑是中國哲學上的正統派，所以守着儒家「成功不必在我」以及「天下爲公」的原則。同時更具有道家「爲而不有」，「功成身退」的高風。這是現代事業家尤其是崇尙功利主義的現實家絕難能表現的一種美德。南通光生於此已躬行實踐，盡達其垂範後人的任務了。</p>
<p>第二，南通先生在辦事業時常常是盡其在己推己及人的。他創辦新事業的時期不如現在的便利。雖然條件不够，窒碍重重，但他以堅强的決心，百折不撓的毅力，勇往邁進，固守着盡其在己的忠誠懷抱，復滲透「我入地獄」的佛家精神信仰。等到事業稍露曙光，則趕快把它作爲模範，樹之風聲，使遠近各地，都來參觀學習。這並不是愛出風頭，或以之爲政治手段，辦實業如要以商業眼光來看，應該要闆獨佔專利，何須鼓勵大家都來競爭搶做呢？所以如此做法，無非要使各地方都一致做傚，走同的途徑，以福國利民。這就是一貫的愛國愛民推已及人的忠恕之道，在事業上的實際遝用。</p>
<p>第三，南通先生處處是以仁存心以事明心的。先生的心情，向來是以佛家的悲天憫之敎旨爲懷抱，以救世救人——爲目的。所以他辦生產事業在那個一無把握毫無憑籍的時期，自然不是爲賺錢而是爲的救國救民，一點一滴，總期有裨補於國計民生，眞可算是一位以仁存心而以大智大勇行大仁的人。同時，他認爲仁民必須以愛物爲根本，以生產爲手段，然後仁民方不落空。所以他把蘇北海邊數千萬畝赤鹵毛之地開墾出來，轉變爲膏腴的棉田以及大量製鹽的塲所，直接養活了幾千百萬人民，興起幾十百個市鎭，這不是他的大仁大智大勇所培植出來的果實嗎？在當時，他認爲國家正在危急存亡之秋，而他所辦的都是救國救民的實事，他要使外人知道，鄰邦承認，中國雖然不幸而亡，尙有這位其心不亡的人；中國雖亂，而尙有有心人在趕做謀長治久安的建國工作·這種有心人的懷抱，孤臣孽子的心情，何等可悲可感，動人心弦！</p>
<p>第四，南通先生是善於因事設教因敎成事的。先生創辦新敎育在中國敎育史上有其特殊的貢獻與地位。他專注重軍國民敎育，師範敎育及實科人才敎育，他是文學家，政治家而不辦文學法學敎育。他要辦事業，所以每項事業他都有一項敎育爲之配合，而創有「父實業，母敎育」之至理名言。於是南通與各種買業相配合的各式的敎育事業，應有儘有。敎育上之專業化，技藝化，社會化，軍事化，是他設敎的宗旨。這樣因事敷敎，才能有敎無類，敎不浪費。同時，有些事業、他也是借助敎育而促其興辦，成長與發展的。任何事業，如果不能學術化專門化，則不會有光明之前途與長足之進步的。先生犀銳的眼光，早見及此。他創辦中國的紡織業，同時即辦紡織敎育。紡織工廠營養了紡織敎育，而紡織敎育也源源供給了紡織界以專門性技術人才。此雖僅舉一例，但可槪括其餘一切事業與敎育的。</p>
<p>二·南通先生的精神表徵</p>
<p>第一，筆路襤褸創業垂統的精神。從先生所手創的事業來看，每種事業總是前無古古人，從無而變爲有的。總是以大刀闊斧，開闢天地的方式進行的，無論紡織，鹽墾，水利，交通，以至敎育等等，無不包括了創造精神在內。這實在業建國的大時代　所必需的精神，在當時有一派主張保存國粹的人說，「中學爲體，西學爲用」，似乎創造精神不甚需要，直到五十年後的今天，也還有部份保守派說國家事只需要按步就班做就得了，不需再採用如何劇烈的手段，仿彿說，在中國工業革命的階段，是可以豁兔的。這實在是似是而非的打盤建設心理的障應論，頗多和先生的創造精神衝突的，在當年以至目前，如果談建設，談工業化，或農業科學化而不其備此種創造精神和鋼鐵手腕，則障礦重重，使你寸步難行，談不到創業和興業，先生不但創業，而且要每一項事業，都能垂之久遠，成了一套的制度系統，行之全國而皆收效，這種創業垂統，傳之千秋萬世的精神，近古以來：唯南通先生一人具備而己。</p>
<p>第二，取人之長與人爲善的精神。先生是懦家正統派是國學根基最深的大師之一，但先生的人生哲學和治學態度是非常近代化科學化，而且能確實應用到一切濟世和創業上去，爲了研究中國的刺繡技術，不惜大胆破除舊禮敎之嫌，向一個女士報筆請敎，共同研究。爲了改良舊劇而獎勵斯舊戲劇界，精神技藝，使成大王，這是科學態度。至於敎育營業，一概捨己從人，步趨歐美成規，成立企業組織，旣不同步自封，亦不自私包辦、集合南北東西全國之人力物力，以共同發起經營，此種善與人同，取人之善，日新又新，力求精　的態度和精神，是永久値得後來者效法的。</p>
<p>第三，祟實黜華，去僞守拙的精神。先生辦敎育目　　子之要領，爲少議諭，多讀書，學寗靜，去浮動，先生爲各學校所題之校訓，有：「力求精進」，「忠實不欺」，「唯精唯一」，爲「勤苦儉樸」。先生所辦之敎育，爲農，爲紡，爲水利，爲葉醫，爲女工，爲盲啞，爲蠶絲，先生所倡辦之實業，亦如其所創辦之各項敎育事業，此種務實黜華的精神之提倡，僞崇拙華的風氣之轉移，於積弱亂久之國家社會，實爲是對症之良藥，可惜靠生一生在野時多而當路在勢時少，故胡適氏種之爲失敗的英雄。實則此種精神之感召鼓舞，歷久不衰，至今日南通之各項事業繼承人奉行不懈，又何嘗失收，又何嘗非更大更久的成功？</p>
<p>第四頭脚並重建鄉救精神。自來中國的愛國主義者，對國事常分抱兩種見解：一種是主張先乎從專政治建設，而再及於敎育經濟之建設；另一種是主張光從事於民生建設，以次漸進於政治上建設。南通先生對這兩稱見解，是不徧不倚的，他主張以民生建設爲主，但如在民生建設之途中有需要先走政治建設路綫者，則亦不妨先行試走。但是他又發現一條新的路綫，就是從建鄉以走到建國的一條路子，這條路後來走的人多起來了，南通先生是第一個發現的人。雖然畢竟以政治未入正軌，民生日趨凋敝，僅僅造出一個桃花泥，改變不了五　十六國的大局勢，故在表層上似乎未克多所成就，但像目前倒堅　塔，頭重脚輕的社會政治，無論如何是持不久，站不穩的，將來仍需走先生發現的路子，方可有前途，這又是可以斷言的。這建鄉建國的種子，已經先生於當年辛苦的播散下去了，早晚仍要開花結實於中國這塊肥美的土地上而爲同胞們所亨受的。</p>
<p>要之，今日之時代，從一面說，比先生所處之時期爲進步，從另一面說，其糟亂其危急之程度更甚於南通先生之當年，先生在當年已盡其在我知其不可而爲的在事業上作爲一番，太大影響於社會貢獻於時代造福於家邦了，假使繼承人們果能追蹤先生的事業和精神之軌轍前進，深信今日之時代和國家，仍大有英雄用武之餘地，中國這個地大物博人衆的國，處處皆可變成南通。所缺少而需要的只是南通光生的志業與精神。</p>

<h3>「怎樣寫作」？</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>常常有許多愛好文藝的靑年朋友來信，或者跑到我家裏來問我一個看來很麻煩，其實很簡單的問題：那就是「怎樣寫作」？</p>
<p>關於指導寫作方面的書籍。在書攤上已經有很多了，我不想再把別人說過的話又重複地說一遍，在這裏，我只想告訴年靑的朋友對於文藝習作，應該有幾點最基本的認識。</p>
<p>如果你老埋怨自己的文章寫不好，這是錯誤的，因為你一定沒有很理智地冷靜地問過自己：</p>
<p>（一）我有寫作的能力嗎？</p>
<p>（二）我知道自己的文章有什麽毛病嗎？</p>
<p>（三）我的文章寫不好，是天生的愚蠢吧？還是我唸的書太少？寫的的文章太少呢？</p>
<p>（四）我喜歡修改自己的文章嗎？</p>
<p>（五）我願意虛心接受別入的批評嗎？</p>
<p>（六）我假使投一篇稿給某報或某雜誌，不見發表出來，我是埋怨那個編憐，還是埋怨自己的文章呢？</p>
<p>（七）我在寫作之前，是費了很多時間思考的嗎？我是先把題材在腦海裏打好了腹稿才動筆寫的嗎？</p>
<p>（八）這個題材是我所最熟悉的嗎？</p>
<p>（九）寫這篇文章的動機，是為了投稿？還是為了練習自己的文字？或者是為了高興呢？</p>
<p>（十）如果我把一篇文章投給某個編輯，一速好幾次都不見發表，我是灰心呢？還是再接再厲地繼續寫下去？</p>
<p>靑年朋友，我知道，你會在這十個問題下面回答得很好，很懇切，你一定不承認沒有寫作的能力，也看不出文章的毛病在那裏，你也許不承認自己的文章寫不好，而懷疑這些編輯先生有偏見，不肯登載一個陌生的靑年投來的稿，其實，那種編輯，在現代，應該早就沒有了，如果有，他根本不配當編輯一篇作品沒有被刋出的原因，篇幅有限，不能每篇刋登是一個原因。次字不好，內容不合，又是一個原因。還有，當編輯的，各人有各人的性格，有的法重形式，有的注重內容：注重形式的，只要你的文字寫得很美，不管內容空洞不空洞，就可以發表，注重內容的，只要這篇小說，或者這首詩的題村好，故事動人，思想正確，文字方面即使差一點也不要緊。當你投稿的時候，如果遇到一個注重形式，而你又偏偏不講究形式的，那麽，自然他不會發表你的文章，你遇到那種事，你千萬不要生氣，要很謙虛地反省一下，究竟我這篇文章的毛病在那裏，我應該好好地車新細讀一遍，修改一遍。如果能把這篇文章送給老師或者幾位朋友看看，多聽取他們的批評，這對於你，比讀幾部什麽創作方法的書要實際有用多了。</p>
<p>在你寫作之前，你必須選擇一個你最熟悉的題材，把小說裏面的人物，先在你的腦海裏多溫習幾遍，你要使小說裏面的人物，一個個活現在你的眼前，不但要看淸他們的面貌，而且要聽熟他們的聲音。他們的性格，他們的思想，他們的生活習慣，你都要十分了解他們，至於他們與她們之間發生的關係或者糾葛，你更要好像親眼看到一般地替他們寫下米。不要寫的太誇張，不要寫的太過火，要順乎人情，要合乎道理，而且要使讀者看了這　小說感到真有其事，真有其人，即使你小說裏面的那個人物，完全是想像的，也要把他寫成眞有這麽一個人，而且這人是社會上的某一階層的典型人物，我們常常會在不知不覺之間遇到他們；但是並不知道他們生活的實際情形，也不知道他們的生活是這麼困難，他們的精神是這麽痛苦，你把他們寫的那麼活躍，那麽逼眞，你的文字的技巧，不用說，這時已經到了成熟的階段，但是要怎樣才能達到成熟的階段呢？那就全要靠自己的努力了，</p>
<p>一個畫家，不知道要經過多少次的修改，才能書成一張究美的畫。一個農夫，至少要經過好幾年的耕種經騐，才知道什麼時候應該下什麼種；付麼土壤，宜於栽種什麼東西。一個作曲家，不知要經過多少次的試唱，多少次的改正，才能做成一個成功的曲子。難道寫文章不經過多少次的修改，不經過長時間的學習；就可以一舉成名的嗎？即使是特別的天才，在學習過程中，他們是嚴　的，勤　的，他們沒有“』到會僥倖成名，但事實使他得到了意外的收穫許多人賜給他一個作家的美名。其實，作家有什麽稀奇？有付麼可　傲的呢？他不是和普通的一樣嗎？所不同的，是他的敏感特別來得快，他特別富於同情心，當於正義感，他的眼光比普通人人銳利，他的腦筋比普通一般人複雜，他要替那些不幸的人羣吶喊，替他們發洩心中的憂苦惱，悲慘，不幸；而這些憂愁，苦；悲慘，不幸，又都是許多人想寫而寫不出；許多人想要知道而又不知道的。于是我們的作家把這些完全寫出來了，他引出了讀者的眼淚，喚起了讀者的同情；他抓住了讀者，控制了讀者；能够使讀者哭，也能使讀者笑；能够使讀者失眠，也能使讀者興奮得跳起來，這就是文學的力量，也是作家的成功！　還有，可愛的靑年朋友，有耐心，有恒心，是使文學成功的要訣，如果你不多寫，多修改，你的文章永遠也寫不好的。如果你要問我：「要怎樣才能使文章寫得好呢」？我只有很簡單的一個回答：「多寫，多修改，多學習」！</p>
<p>關于這題目，還有要說的，以復有功夫再寫吧。</p>
<h3>「蒲風」與蒲風</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>前些日子，在報上看到一段新聞，大意是這一樣的：</p>
<p>有一位靑年某君（筆名蒲風），平日常常在中央日報及前錢日報副刋寫文章，因逼於生活之窮困，於某日携手槍一枝，在街頭實行搶刧，為警察所追捕，解送法院，供認不諱，乃由法院判處徒刑七年云云……</p>
<p>在此時此地，携槍行劫之類，實已近乎狗咬人，原算不得付麽「新聞」；然而，它終於引起了人們——至少是一部份人們的注意，那原因，大槪不外乎是由於一般人——尤其是文擊界的朋友及一般文藝靑年們，不禁因此而興「文人末路」之感吧？</p>
<p>至於我個人和一些寫詩的朋友舞呢。則除此之外，還不能不由於「蒲風」這個筆名而被引起特別的注意。</p>
<p>大槪對於抗戰前後——尤其是戰前——的詩增曾經多少留意過的人們都不至於不知道：在當年的新詩壇上曾經有過「蒲風」這位詩作者的存在吧？因為他不但在當時的各種文藝刋物上發表過許多詩作，而且還出過好幾本長短詩集，如「茫茫夜」「六月流火」「生活」「可憐虫」『在抗戰的旗下」……等等。</p>
<p>也就因為這個緣故，此類讀者看到這段消息的時候，一定多少不免懷着這麼一種疑問：這個「蒲風」難道就是那位寫詩的蒲風嗎？……</p>
<p>我之所以要寫這篇短文，其動機，也正是為着要解答這一疑團。</p>
<p>首先，我要確切地告訴諸位：這位「蒲風」，決不是詩人蒲風。</p>
<p>因為詩人蒲風早在抗戰期間在江南敵後病死了。一個死去了好幾年的人，怎麽會突然起死回生，持槍搶刧呢？</p>
<p>所以，顯然地，這位搶人的「蒲風」，雖同為寫文章的人，但却決不是當年的那位詩人蒲風。</p>
<p>筆者和故詩人蒲風有小同鄕之誼，而日後來又有許多時間常常在一塊，對於他的一切知較詳；所以，當自己看到了這段消息以後，就深覺有代死者加以更正的必要。因為在目前的社會情况下面，能够有勇氣去當强盜也許竟是一件値得羨慕的事情；可是，事情旣然不是亡友幹的，自未便「掠美」，祇好代為作個更正和聲明。</p>
<p>最後，筆者，還有一點感想，那就是：在文壇上，常常發現諸如此類的使用着同一筆名的人。而這種情形，又似乎可以分做有意與偶同兩種。要是由於偶同，自無可非議，但為彼此方便計，也還是以趕快改掉為妙，以免在種種塲合中演成使人啼笑皆非的雙包案。要是事出有意，則不管是由於何種動機，概屬不足爲訓！　如「魯迅」這一筆然，雖然據我所知，當日周樹人先生也幷未向內政部註册專利，但當杭州也發現一個靑年「魯迅」的時候，那我們却無論如何也不至於反而疑心周先生不免有「冒牌」之嫌吧？……</p>

<h3>片語　生活</h3>
<p>— 青果</p>
<p>一生活是一只眞實的歌，應該唱得又響又亮。</p>
<p>不要說它苦澀，不要說它憂傷；它本來就芬芳，就快活的。</p>
<p>春天了，山林綠透了，河水綠透了。而你的草綠色的童軍服呢？　了麼？</p>
<p>你看，陽光在笑了。讓陽光晒晒你霉了的草綠色的童軍服吧。</p>
<p>走出來啊，外邊多新鮮，多寬闊呀！你的歌一定可以唱得更好些的。</p>
<p>童年</p>
<p>是不是，童年就是金色的日子？</p>
<p>要愛惜它，要懂得怎樣去愛惜你從金色的日子裏成長起來的生命。</p>
<p>孩子的夢是最多的，願你的夢生着一雙透明的翹子，馱着生命，自由地飛翔在蔚藍的天空。</p>
<p>但不要跌落下來，不要像一隻在春天裏飄浮的風箏，貪戀東風，終於墜落在年青的樹枝或歡笑的河流上。</p>
<p>你是健康的。幸福永遠會指給你的方向。</p>
<p>夜</p>
<p>夜，白色的夜，像一片荒凉的白色沙漠的夜。</p>
<p>如今，我仍舊馱運着綠色的希冀；追踪着疏落而又糢糊的足印，跋踄於人間的茫茫的大漠。</p>
<p>然通，什麽時候呵，我才可以走到綠洲？</p>
<p>比駝鈴還要凄苦，我在不息地搖着我的鈴子。眞正寂寞呀，這瘦弱的飢渴的地方。……</p>
<p>歌</p>
<p>歌，紅色的歌，像一朶燃燒的紅色火熖的歌。</p>
<p>歌燒着我，燒着夜，燒着夜里的人舞。</p>
<p>然而，不久以後，歌聲便熄滅了。</p>
<p>我苦痛，默默地把生活譜在自己的心弦上。</p>
<p>還有誰能够聽取我一點聲音呢？……</p>
<p>願風砂厚重些吧！願歌就埋葬在裏面去吧！</p>

<p>目十七世紀開始，有一派畫家，其作品專以村舍內部爲對象，他們的畫多半是小型的，並且描寫着一段故事。「凱蒂的信」是這種畫的代表作。作者一八三一年生於巴巴都斯，一九〇四年逝世。幼年即至英倫進雷氏學校，一八五五年開始在皇家藝術學院展覽其作品。他一生的作品的畫面沒有超過箱子那樣大小的。（徐君默）</p>
<h3>題玉峯用孟郊韵</h3>
<p>— 顧一樵</p>
<p>人夜流星殞，行雲憇石牀；峯巍文筆立，湖翠野花香；獨鶴來天表，孤帆接水光；危亭憑弔處，忍說舊沙塲！</p>
<p>謁　亭林先生墓用張祜韵　顧一樵</p>
<p>十載長征後，三吳氣未吞；書遺黃石屐，山擁白雲根，秦塔峯頭樹，茜墩水上村；高風垂萬世，開繼大成門。</p>
<h3>前題</h3>
<p>— 顧一樵</p>
<p>越王締造中興業，吳相三分足古今；大禹世家原祖禹，東林學派又亭林；神州利病從何說？天下興亡欲廢吟！瞻拜茜墩遺履在，秦峰塔影柏森森！</p>
<p>用葛次仲亞卿集唐人句原　韵題馬鞍山　施卿鵬</p>
<p>我來自北溟，攬勝此山隅；畢竟江南好，容身在一壺；况乃林巒潔，深藏渾若虛；茅屋楸枰局，流水板橋居；洞幽伏猛虎，天低盡平蕪；靈境豁然開，更愛馬鞍廬；嶙峋多怪石，文筆點眉須；刧後大維殿，神呵力未圖；放瑪試春郊，嗟我日疇躇；陡地起雲屛，玉峯凝翠琚；咫尺桃源境，得與國人俱；流霞飛閣上，詩情出水　；題咏遍高齋，名山彩筆敷，泱泱湖水淸，澤及萬頃餘；舉目瞰四郊，梅老榴紅初；愛山不忍去，思鄉戀桑楡；安得黃粱熱？重溫老莊書；水淸溯泉源，借問出山無？人生原是客，到處襟懷抒；吾道儒釋門，濟世意未殊；槃礴欲解衣，撥墨不成珠；高風我仰止，浩歌發歸途。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血331</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>第一卷　七封秘緘　第九章　險巇的征途</p>
<p>前情節略</p>
<p>八年抗戰，我國千百萬英勇的愛國兒女，爲了守衛祖國，拿鮮紅的熱血，洒遍了每寸山河。我舞收集了這些悲壯的故實，來紀念恢復失土的艱苦。（但是，僅僅紀念是不够的！勝利以來，倐忽二載，舊癡累累，尙未及調治，而新創乃遂日頻增；所以我們紀念已經成仁的同志之外，還得徹底警覺，牢牢守住自己的崗位，認淸敵人，到了時候，不惜洒却最後一滴鮮血，誓與這更惡毒的</p>
<p>第一個故實一「七封秘緘」－紀載倭寇與希　等，訂定七紙秘密文件，準備掀起二次世界大戰。鶴見玉（古承志）不滿倭寇奸據燒殺及毒化政策，同時發見本人原為革命老同盟古繼漢志士後嗣，於是藉日倭參謀本部職位之掩蔽，微集同志，設十二座秘密電台，且涉險參加黑龍會，要把這「七封秘緘」揭露出來，企圖挽回人類的浩刧。</p>
<p>第一次搜索秘緘，未獲成功；邂逅神秘女諜中村萍子，二人相互合作，於四十八小時內，蹈險破壞戰魔之「八的　秘密」。惟鶴見的另一女性同志紀　羣　，未能參加此舉，感覺落漠，乃奮袂矍　起，親赴關外，糾集同志，另闢路綫，　追踪潛入西北之諜集團，予　打擊</p>
<p>八月一日，鶴見和萍子在滬把事情料理淸楚，萍子應召，搭乘海輪直接返國，鶴見亦因收到我的密電，匆匆趕到北平。</p>
<p>本來在一週之前，我們已經把移植總站問題，完全佈置妥當，只須由我率領部下，順平綏綫到大同，再轉太原，並無曲折。紀　羣的一部分，亦在鶴見動身赴滬的當日，決定回潘一行，擴增實力，隨後趕到太原。一切行動和供應等等瑣項一都計議明白。</p>
<p>可是就在泱定計劃的第二天，（七月三十一），平津局面變化太大，同時又收到東京「〇十二」，潘陽「〇二」緊急情報，知道了華北軍部，為了響應「八的秘密」大舉，也準備了驚人的演出，而松部土肥原，同時發動改組諜報網的運動。因有黑龍會執行幹部撑腰，土肥原居然大發在言：「無論上峯允許與否，寗可犧牲自已職權，也要達到目的」！這目的的主要着限，就在情報網的電訊門部上。換句話說，他要取消鶴見的職位了。</p>
<p>八月一二兩日，我和w君討論了許多方案，都無決議·三日四日，鶴見返平，也和我們訂細計議了幾個切實辦法；同時向「〇十二」和「〇二」發出幾種機密佈置訓令；只等覆訊一到，我們就要依照辦法，發動反攻。殊不知這兩處覆訊未到，近衛却有明電，由松井轉達鶴見，召他回國「受訓週」－w也收到「〇十二」，「〇二」，等轉達鶴見的緊急報告，「空氣惡劣，速返國佈置；前項訓令，雖遵辦，因有新突變，恐無實益」。</p>
<p>麻煩的事，要麼不來；一來總是接二連三。這也可以應到那句俗諺：「福無雙至，禍不單行」！</p>
<p>第二件驚人的消息，也由w君總部收到；「平轉，鶴見玉樣：玉兄－中村萍子，因支那滬案，突遭拘執，在軟禁中，俟玉兄返京證明，或能洗淸糾紛。柳詩急告</p>
<p>還有一件更惡劣的消息，由天津遞來，是一封告急秘電：－天津反謀組織秘密總站，被日特工擊破；重要人員，大半被捉。耀羣由瀋陽回平，路過津地，有營救同志嫌疑，聞亦遭日方拘禁。蕭虎城（小老虎）現雖走避，日方搜索甚急，津地偽警，指為「童妖」，正縣賞捉拿中。</p>
<p>啓　－本卷「七封秘緘」，尚餘第九十兩草，刊畢，即出單行本。第二卷一二號前哨」或可同時間世。承讀者諸君下詢，謹此奉告。……又者，兩週前家人數口，同罹險症，校中又屆學期終大考，身心交悴，無法校稿，致中輟兩週之久，現大考已結束，病者已脫險就愈，合向讀衆諸君致歉－筆者）</p>
<p>夢</p>
<p>夢，藍色的夢，像一個闊朗的藍色天空的夢。</p>
<p>藍色天空閃爍亮的星子。</p>
<p>聰明的人說：天上的星子就是地上的好人。</p>
<p>而當星子沉落得憶完的時候，黎明便近了。</p>
<p>但是，是不是當好人死得快完的時候，理想便近了呢？</p>
<p>今晚的星子好多啊，天空格外顯得藍。夜也　些。……</p>
<h3>讀詩偶記</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>自來評杜詩者多矣，而其指摘疵纇，最中肯棨者，莫鄭善夫若，善夫之言曰：「詩之佳處，正在不必說到盡，不必寫到眞，而其欲說欲寫者，自宛然可想，雖可想而又不可道，斯得風人之義。杜公往往要到真處盡處，所以失之』。又云：「長篇沈著頓挫，指事陳情，有根節骨格，此杜老獨擅之能，唐人皆出其下。然詩正不以此為貴，但可以為難而已。宋人學之，往往以文為詩，雅道大壞，由杜老起之也』。其持論精　如此！</p>
<h3>獨伯漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>世界上最不幸的，便是你所戀愛的對東，是一個濫用愛情者。濫愛者的愛情有如偽幣。不能濟受者的貧窮，以能使受者因自覺被欺騙而至於憤怒。</p>
<p>最近重讀了柏地耶（F．Bedier）的愁斯丹和綺瑟。從基督教傳到歐洲以後，這是第一篇熱烈沈痛的戀愛故事，正像朱孟實先生說的那樣，我們可以由牠看見中世紀的詩人們在怯懦的面孔後面藏着堅勇的決心，這故事所以贏得無數人們的限淚，因為這裏面所表規的不她濫愛——，專一的愛勝似黃金的價值。</p>
<p>如果不是侮辱，便是憤激。</p>
<p>SamuelFoote謂：「白馬與美婦相類，兩老都錶難管理的騷擾物。前者難保使之潔；後者雖保使之　。」</p>
<p>也許是有感而發吧！我想，這句話應用在寨西比用崔巾國較更（注意此「更」字）食適。這種易汚的美婦，絕不會有愛的感覺。她所謂的愛，也只是肉慾的訛解而已。</p>
<p>自私的庸俗的「愛情」，像狗一樣，被牠追逐，被牠所汚最甚者，乃是牠所最「愛情」的人誰說在自私的土壤會滋生眞正的愛呢？愛是給予，不是獲得；愛雞負累，不是發洩。</p>
<p>基督甘於背十字架，故能成就其偉大的愛。我們這功利的人吃人的社會上，太缺乏背十字架的愛情了。</p>
<p>妬嫉和自私是同胞姊妹。妬嫉自己愛人的幸福，便是恥辱。偷窺自已深愛的人去和一個比自己高賣的人接吻，而固執地自私地破壞對方的幸輻，那簡直他一種不可　兔的　辱。</p>

<h3>憶整編七十四師</h3>
<p>— 阿病</p>
<p>此次在沂蒙山區，全師壯烈殉難之整編第七十四師，其前身即為馳譽全國，轉輾湘鄂贛的七十四軍。憶自民國二十七年五月在湖南常德入伍時，所隸即該軍所屬第五十八師，時軍長為兪濟時將軍，副軍長即現任由東省主席王耀武將軍。五十八師師長為馮聖法將軍，旅長為勞冠英將軍，勞旅長在江西馬迴　一役，頗出風項。將來編篡戰史，恐亦少不了他的大名。</p>
<p>二十八年春天，我們由湖南沅陵赴湘陰，忽聞兪軍長即於次日來隊檢閱。於是我們奉命漏夜修剪頭髮。湘陰縣小，理髮店甚少，而我們丘八同志又多，因雨連店裏的小徒弟，亦祗好動員來替我們服務了個小徒弟，拿着一把鏡了的刺刀，剃顯與鉋葫蘆一樣，有的地方剩一塊，為的地方連皮也刮去了。未及把頭剃好，己血痕斑斑，其苦當非現在坐在頭等理髮店中的豪貴們所能想像。</p>
<p>二十八年冬天，兪軍長奉命調長八十六軍來浙，我們的師長馮聖法氏亦隨調來浙。于耀武將軍即於此時升任軍長，五十八師師長亦調奉化陳式正將軍繼任。惟任期僅五月，而在此五月中，正參與贛北會戰及第一次長沙會戰，故無一日空閑，陳將軍亦可謂苦命矣。陳卸任後即由副師長廖齡奇升任，廖為湖南祁陽人，軍校四期生，他雖武人，却是個腹便便的大胖，治軍亦嚴。尙有一特點，即其私人信件，多由他本人作覆，筆者時任職於副官處，常見其親筆信送總收發寄發故廖之部下，多甚愛戴，惜於民國三十年秋天第二次長沙會戰時，因貽誤軍機，在衡陽花園槍決。</p>
<p>繼廖而起者即此次殉職之張靈甫將軍。張將軍原為廖之副師長，長沙會職失利時，部隊失去運絡，紛紛向衡陽撤退，張將軍因收容退兵有功，故不但不受處分，反得升任，亦為初科所不及。又此次連同殉難之副師長蔡仁傑將軍，即那時纔任團長。直到卅四年上半年，王耀武將軍奉命升第四方面單司令官，軍長一職，才調五十七師師長施中誠將軍繼任，後施復他調，論功由張將軍繼任，整編後，復蟬聯改任師長，直至沂蒙山殉難，整七十四軍竟全軍壯烈殉難才宣告完結。</p>
<p>此後這個名譽的番號，又不知誰來領受？回憶七十四軍成立於抗戰初期，其嚴肅的軍紀，久為全國人士所稱道，其彪炳的戰績，將永　於史冊。我們在初成立時，即為其中的一員，登千山，涉萬水，　時三四年，而今聽得這個惡耗，不禁悲從中來，謹特虔誠地向七十四軍全軍官兵，及牧當時同學朋友們致最敬禮。</p>
<h3>暑期計劃</h3>
<p>— 謝章濤</p>
<p>暑假開始，一連串漫長的夏日等待過，也許不少人有成計劉，表格，擬訂好等特實現，但是因為一學期來刻板的生活和繁重的課程，使緊張，厭倦了的身心，一到了假期中鬆弛的空氣，會將這些計劃表格都拋向腦後；結果是畫睡，閒談，逛公園，盪馬路，糊塗的過了一夏。記得在公　救護隊舉辦的一個週六討論會上，我曾提出「如何消磨暑期」的題目，而且為了預備發言，有了下面的偏見，這偏見也許能得到一部份人的共嗚！</p>
<p>暑期中，應該學習一些生活上所必需之技術，如游泳，急救法（人工呼吸法，止血，句紮等），騎馬，爬樹（爬山，爬繩等），射擊，划船等，這些技術的學習，也許是很化錢的，也許在城布中不能學習，或者是要長期的時間，但是你化下的金錢，時間決不虛擲了，或是十倍，百倍的收穫，或竟是你最寶貴生命的拯救，也是學習這些最高的收穫。在你悠長的生活史上，在危難時，這些技術或有着決定生死區別的作用。就如游泳而論，最近海上航輪迭告失事，只見溺斃數十，數百的消息，而沒有像歐美那樣有在海上掙扎數小時，或抓攀浮物漂浮數十小時而獲救的例子，這就是我國人民未習游泳，忽略救生技術之明證。又如急救法，不論人工呼吸法，止血法，簡便包紮法，在危急時，能顯出莫大的效力，有時沒有初步別救護，雖得醫生的診療與手術，也難挽回。</p>
<p>一個人在生命過程中，不能絕對的能避免意外，危難的發生，學習這些必需的技術、實在是很好未雨綢繆的方法！</p>
<h3>色彩的——奇異作用</h3>
<p>— 郭永年</p>
<p>自從牛頓式以三稜鏡觀察發現七色光帶後，世人對於色彩的　本原理早已明瞭，在實用方面，向來只就美學的眼光去選用不同的色彩；用科學方法選擇色彩，以達到某種特殊的效果，還是數年來的事。下列諸事實，頗可作為我人參考：</p>
<p>美國支芝哥一乳酪煉製廠，，特將廠房的一大塊破璃窗漆以窗的外面沒有了蒼蠅的聚集，而其他的玻璃外面仍舊佈滿密集着很厚的蠅羣。所以藍色是却蠅的色彩。在美國另有深橘黃色的電燈專供驅蚊之用。</p>
<p>紐約一家淡綠色內壁的大飯店，生意很好，但經理嫌吃客在店內坐留時問過長，經色彩專家指示，牆壁改漆紅黃二色相間後，吃客的交換加速，營利增加百分之五十。</p>
<p>美國西部一工廠，廠房內溫度經常保　七十二度，女工們常向廠方訴稱，感覺寒冷。廠主命最近因欲遮蔽一部份陽光的直射藍色，無意中發現這塊改漆玻璃將全部藍綠色之牆壁，改漆珊瑚色後，即不聞工人肅冷之聲。</p>
<p>另一工廠之工人門搬運裝滿煙嘴之黑色金屬箱時，常稱背痛。後來將箱改漆淺綠色，反有工人稱箱比前輕多了。</p>
<p>利用白色皮射而黑色吸熱量的簡單原理者，有紐約的一打包公司。在春季將屋頂漆以白色，炎熟的夏天溫度竟低了好殘度，冬天再改漆黑色，以便吸熱。裝水汀的工匠曾發覺五檔　白色的水汀所產生的熱量與六檔鍍金屬色或黑色的水汀一樣。</p>
<p>色彩不調和的光綫能擭傷目力，因而發生疲倦及神經緊張的現象。茄羅林拿州一紡織廠專視察斜文布之布紋的女工們，因布是綠色又很快的在轉動着，時需抬頭　白墻以圖休息，此時白牆在眼中現成桃色，再　頭工作時，需候好幾秒鐘始能恢復視力，經廠方工程師之硏究將白牆改漆粉紅之桃色，工作効率大增。</p>
<p>司克立柏斯海洋學學院，發現大量附著于般身名斗「藤　」的海水小甲殼虫，牠們最喜歡深的色彩。如果水面下船身，改漆淺綠色或白色，則這類討厭的汚物，大可減少。這一簡單的發明，巳使全美國船運業每年節省下一億元美金的「掃除藤壺蟲」賬款！</p>
<p>美國工業界由於大戰期中所得經騐，知全部色彩化的工廠，龍增加百分之十五至三十的生　量，所以成千的廠家均採用了新的色彩方法。現今的標準鐵工廠內車床等機身，均漆以淺灰色，工作部份漆奶油色，使被機身　托出來；天花板刷白色；墻及　柱八呎下是灰綠色；地板用淡黃色或灰色；滅火設備紅色；念救用品綠色；危險物如低的橫樑，平臺的邊緣及低穴，起重機的吊鈞及載貨小車均漆成黑底黃色條子。這樣的色彩分配，看來很調和悅目，但與美術無關，完全在作用上設計的。據採用上述色彩之各廠報吿稱，廠房光度可增　一倍；工作正確度增四成；工人擅自離位減少六成；意外事件之發生減少二至四成；零件之被棄於地上損失之減少，積二個月之價值，即可抵全部油漆之條改費用。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 流行歌曲在美洲</p>
<p>「歌舞昇平」，祗有美洲配得上如此說，差不多每個有文藝興趣的人，都會胡　幾首詩，譜幾支歌曲，女製曲家多如過江之鯽。會參加曉市頓筆會和作家協會，每星期開會選的。如果材料新穎，市民愛唱，就行為流行歌曲Hit　p　　ade。每星期有許多流行歌曲出版，多數被影片公司採用，並灌成唱片。在五年前流行於美國的歌曲，現准紅遍上海各舞塲。美國的流行歌曲，壽命都很短促，平均不到一年就無人再唱了。有若干流行歌曲，實在粗俗不堪，像PistolPackingMamna之類，可說是一無是處，曾流行於南部各省，不但美國人唱，留美學生也在唱，美國南部的女子穿了牧童裝，皮背心，短流蘇　，闊邊帽，半高統靴，掛了手槍，那種打扮比十三妹還要英颯、我輩文弱書生見了，不免倒退三步。流行歌曲中並非沒有佳作，例如瓊立絲麗在好萊塢軍之友社HollgwoodCenteen（我不知道中文譯者）中所唱的就是空前住製，不過佳曲還得有佳人來唱。瓊立絲麗唱來多麼圓潤旖旎，換了一個人就興趣素然了，近來上海也有人效顰的，英文發香不準，腔調有些像申曲，不中不西、聽了皮膚起答，怪難受的。</p>
<h3>「芳名處處磚」</h3>
<p>— 馬高</p>
<p>這和作者其他改變劇本一樣，對白倘皮流暢，結構簡練淸明，人物節省，是所謂的喜劇，然而它們是一樣地不起我們的興趣，我總覺得這一類的作品空　其表，內容貧乏無力，給予觀眾什麽呢？除了一陣陣被逗出來的笑以外，就是一個空虛的感覺。</p>
<p>作為這個戲的主題，是肥皂業鉅子的「教子」，把一個紈絝子弟從遊蕩成性的惡習裏引到正路上來，那末他用的是什麽方法呢？他的兒子被激之後又走上怎麼樣一條路呢？這裏顯示給我們的是「惡性海派」的神通廣大，空頭騙術的僥倖成功，近乎流氓拆白的洋塲習癖。因此許多問題的解答太功台，使人不敢置信：試想一個祇把廣告滿天飛，辦公室表僅有四塊肥皂樣品的公司，如何能……總之，這表的疑問太多。</p>
<p>而且把工業家的塲面寫得太順利了，此刻正經實事生產的工業冢恐怕都在高利貸的壓榨下喘不過氣來，作者不用他的筆把實況描寫，令我們遺憾。</p>
<p>導演即是作者，輕車熟路自然方便，因此演出十分得體，處理氣氛節奏明快利落。</p>
<p>在話劇演出困難的今天，而有這個好的機會，能集中這麼多優秀的演員，爲什麽不選擇一個更具現實意義的戲來演呢而且僅僅費六天的工夫就把戲趕出來，簡直草率又浪費，從事撐持戲劇運動的朋友們，應該隨時警惕，不要讓商業利益過於滲進了我們的心，久而久之被群眾唾棄的厄運將不可避免的。</p>
<h3>談本市的國教班</h3>
<p>— 陳榮傑</p>
<p>國敎班是國民敎育班的簡稱，包括兒童成人兩部份，這個名稱開始被人發覺，還只是前年得事。換一句話說，國敎班推行到現在，還沒有二年，歷史是相當短促。</p>
<p>教育局辦理國敎班，可以說是煞費苦心，才想出這樣一個辦法。為了普及激育，市校一時又不可能容納這許多失學國民，所以才假借私校的教室，利用下午的空瑕時間和設備，創辦一些小規模的市立國民學校。我們不否認，也不抹殺，國敎班推行以來的成績，多少失學的流浪街頭的兒童，以及業餘的成人，都有一個入學的機會。然而，事有利則有弊，尤共是組織尚不十分健全的國敎班乏人照料的孤兒，它的成長，難免有許多缺點存在着。</p>
<p>稱國教班為「孤兒」並不過份，它是一直沒有被人督促照　照理，它是所謂小規模的國民學校，一切應由敎育局派員負責，但在事實上敎育局鞭長莫及。根本沒有辦法管理，私校校長對於這些又感到頭痛，不高興兼　。於是這些苦雞的「孤兒」，便無所管束地獨自生長，許多　病的發生，也就不能避免了。</p>
<p>眼見本期的國教班就要結束，下期的舉辦是無疑的，希　　育局能够有更究全的辦法，杜绝過去那些名額不足，時間不足，科目不足，訓練不足的流　，　正完成搶救的任務。</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>夢的科學　（二）</h3>
<p>— 顧均正</p>
<p>夢魘是怎樣一回事？</p>
<p>據調查，五人中必有一人有過夢魘，而三個夢中只有一個是完全愉快。許多權威者相信，夢魘是極嚴重的內心衝突的一種表現，並且是夢的最重要型式，因為牠刺激起睡眠中所能存在的最強烈的心理活動。據權威者的報告，有人曾經因夢魘而引起了高血壓或心藏病而死。</p>
<p>夢表示什麽意義嗎？</p>
<p>夢有很重要的意義。權威者曾經發現，夢不但顯示你日間的思想和行動，並且更能顯示你的人格。然而夢並不能如實地解釋。事實上所有的夢都是象徵的——牠們寶在的意義被隱藏在一個比喻或純粹的空想之中。</p>
<p>做意識的心不斷地檢查着下意識的心的時侯，下意識就把牠的實在情形偽裝為家徵的圖　來蒙蔽檢查者。檢查者的這一　備態度，多數權威者都以為是由於下列兩個原因：（一）人類對於朱知的事物，天賦蓋一種莫明其好的恐懼；（二）恐怕自己殲霤獨巒，有傷意淤自我的休嚴？</p>
<p>每個人做夢都用同樣的象徵嗎？</p>
<p>有些象徵完全得自過去的經騐。譬如一個小孩子曾經給汽車所撞傷，那末他夢見汽車就可象徵痛楚或身體上的創傷；如果這小孩子曾經在假日乘汽車出游，那末他夢見汽車就象徵自由或逃避日常生活的抑制。</p>
<p>然而有些象徵在每個人的夢裏屢屢出現，就有着基本的或一般的意義。屢見不鮮的是父親被象徵為國王，教師，上帝，或警察，母親被象徵為王后，土地，甚或別人的母親。逕些以及與此相同的基本象徵，都根深蒂固地潛伏在人類的下意識之中，可以一直追溯到初民的象徵的象形文字。然而，就是這些基本的象徵也常隨個人的經騐而變，沒有一種象徵對各人有同樣的意義。</p>

<h3>Central Government Holds Important Meeting Yesterday; President Chiang Kai-shek Earnestly Explains the Current Situation; Decides to Strengthen Military Suppression of the Communist Army and Handle Elections According to Established Procedures</h3>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) The leading figures of the Guomindang from various provinces held an important meeting in the capital on the 30th to discuss the current situation. This gathering took the form of a joint meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee. President Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting in person. All members of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee attended, with the exception of Committee Member Wu Jingheng, who was in Shanghai and unable to attend in person, but submitted his written opinions, entrusting Committee Member Pan Gongzhan to bring them to Nanjing for discussion at the joint meeting.

<p>(Our Changchun Dispatch, 30th) The National Army advancing from Changtu met with the Siping garrison at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 30th. The Communist army collapsed and retreated in two directions, east and west. The National Army advancing southward from Gongzhuling will soon join forces with the National Army advancing from the north. The Communist army on the north bank of the Liao River has been cleared, and the Communist army on the Jilin-Changchun line has retreated to the Jilin-Shenyang line.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th) The siege of Siping has been lifted. The National Army advancing from the north in thirty-six hours defeated the main force of the Second Column of the Communist army that was blocking them at Siping Nanfengmiaozi. Before dawn on the 30th, they met with the Siping garrison, which had fought bitterly for seventeen days and nights. The remnants of the Communist army collapsed and retreated towards Huoshiling and Bamiancheng, east and west of Siping. The battle of Siping has given the Communist army a major lesson. They colluded with the North Korean and Korean Communists, and used Japanese prisoners of war, to launch a fierce attack on Siping with tens of thousands of troops, ten times the size of the garrison, but failed to take it. Instead, they suffered a disastrous defeat and dispersal, with casualties reaching half of their force. The Communist army's attempt to rely on foreign forces to rebel and secede from the national territory should have caused them to reflect during the seventeen-day battle to besiege Siping.</p>
<p>(Our Changchun Dispatch, 30th) Now that the siege of Siping has been lifted, the Changchun-Shenyang advance forces are about to meet, and the situation in the Northeast has entered a new phase. The Communist army's so-called summer offensive has now come to an end. However, according to authoritative observers, the future situation in the Northeast depends entirely on the next seven to fourteen months. Recalling the situation in the past six months, the Communist army launched an offensive every two months. In order for the Northeast to achieve permanent stability in the future, it is necessary to change the previous approach and make necessary changes to all military and political facilities. Otherwise, after these four months, even if there is a desire to act, it will be difficult to do so due to the environment. Currently, Andong is still controlled by the Communist army, and it must be recovered, so that the Communist army in the Northeast has no way to connect in the north and south. The damage to the China Changchun Railway is too great, and repairs will not be completed in a short time. Currently, efforts are being made to repair the highway first, so that north-south passenger and freight transport can be interconnected. Cars have already been tested between Changchun and Gongzhuling yesterday.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th) Director Du recently told reporters that the victory at Siping is of great significance, relating to the entire war situation in the Northeast.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th) This afternoon, the citizens of Changchun listened to the news of the lifting of the siege of Siping and the collapse of the Communist army with extremely excited emotions. Several newspapers also published extra editions. Street corners are full of newspapers with this news. Now, the citizens of Changchun have shifted their focus from the battle situation in the Siping urban area to the results of the National Army's capture of the fleeing Communist army, as they deeply know that this is directly related to the long-term stability of Changchun in the future. Therefore, many people judge that the general prices in Changchun will soon fall.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Jilin, 30th) Our troops advancing westward along the Jilin-Changchun Railway launched a dawn attack on the morning of the 30th. After a brief battle with the Communist army at Huapichang, they entered the Huapichang railway station at 7:00 AM, and immediately continued to fight towards the Huapichang urban area (one kilometer south of the railway station). The Communist army struggled desperately, and the artillery fire was quite fierce. Our army charged repeatedly, and finally completely captured Huapichang at about 8:00 AM. The Communist army's 103rd Division, stationed in Huapichang, numbering about 1,500, was severely attacked by our army on the morning of the 30th. Their remnants fled from the mountainous area below Huapichang to Qitamu and Liangjiazi. The National Army is tracking and pursuing them.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Lushan Area Cut into Two Sections; Recover Zhangqiu City in Jiaodong; National Army in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway Carries Out Encirclement</h3>
<p>(Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 30th) The National Army's attack on the Yimeng Mountain area is progressing rapidly. It has reached the heart of the mountainous area, more than fifty kilometers from Xinhai and only ten kilometers from Donglidian, where the headquarters of the Communist Army's East China Field Army is located. After suffering heavy casualties, Chen Yi was forced to withdraw his headquarters to Qixiong. As of the evening of the 30th, eight columns of the Communist army in the mountainous area have been cut into two sections, making it easier to annihilate them separately.</p>
<p>(Our Jinan Dispatch, 30th) The Wang Yaowu Corps, attacking eastward along the Jiaoji Railway in response to the National Army in the Yimeng Mountain area, has made new progress. After recovering Mingshui on the 29th, the corps divided its troops into three routes. One route went north and recovered Zhangqiu City that evening. One route advanced east and reached near Puju on the evening of the 30th. One route went south along the Minglai Highway and recovered Wenzu Town that evening, and occupied Heiyuzhuang on the afternoon of the 30th. By evening, the advance force had occupied Ziyangguan. This is located at the border between Zi and Qi counties, with dangerous terrain, thirty-five kilometers north of Mingshui and less than thirty kilometers south of Laiwu. The meeting with Ou Zhen's troops in Laiwu is imminent.</p>
<p>(Our Lixian Dispatch, 30th) Wang Tiewu flew from Lixian back to Jinan at 10:00 AM on the 30th. He stayed in Lixian for one day and expressed satisfaction with the seamless cooperation between the military and political authorities in Lixian.</p>
<p>(Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 30th) Near Xihuanghe and Hebei Shore in counties of Fan, Xiao and surrounding area, recently it has been noted that Liu Bocheng's troops have a couple of columns with an attempt to cross the river and assist the Communist army in Yimeng Mountain area. The National Army has been prepared for it.</p>
<p>(Our Baoding Dispatch, 30th) The war situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has turned to a favorable situation for the National Army. The north and south National Army echo each other and adopt an encircling posture. The conservative army has begun to counterattack north along the railway last night and captured Caohe. Most of the Communist army in the suburbs of Baoding has gradually retreated, and some of the main force has moved west to Mancheng, Xushui, and Wanxian. The National Army is taking the opportunity to extend its offensive outwards, and many strongholds in the northeastern suburbs have been recovered. Morale is high, and prices in the city have also recovered. In addition, the Communist army that invaded Rongcheng has been repelled.</p>
<p>(Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th) Sun Lianzhong, Director of the Baosui Office, went to Zhuoxian yesterday to supervise the troops and returned to Beiping on the 30th. It is also learned that the Baoding Airport cannot yet land planes due to damaged artillery roads. The National Army's deployment is ready and can begin the counteroffensive. The two armies are still facing each other near Beihedian today. Last night, the railway south of Zhuoxian and near Nangangbian was damaged, and the southward army is still stopped at Changxindian. In addition, after the Communist army occupied Xushui and Gucheng, they launched a fierce attack on Bingshui and Yixian, and are currently fighting fiercely with the garrison. The troops in Ding and Yi are also under siege by more than fifty Communist troops coming from the east and west.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Remarks</h3>
<p>Agricultural Country's Economy Will Not Collapse</p>
<p>(Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th) After attending the weekly memorial service at the Beiping City Party Headquarters on the morning of the 30th, Kong Xiangxi met with our reporter and said that his trip was to understand the situation in the north and handle personal matters, and also to raise funds for Yanjing University and China University. He plans to go to Tianjin for a trip and then return to Jin to visit his sister who is ill, and then return to Beijing via Beiping. He believes that although China's current economic situation is chaotic, it will not collapse, because only industrial economies can collapse, while China is an agricultural country. He also said that the most important thing at present is to stabilize the currency system and restore currency credibility. As for repeated adjustments to foreign exchange rates, it will only encourage people to hoard gold and foreign currency, making the situation more chaotic. Regarding the 500 million loan, he said that the United States has reserved this fund for China and that the United States absolutely supports the National Government. Regarding domestic political issues, he said that maintaining social order and the government's suppression of bandits are its unavoidable responsibilities. Kong attended a banquet hosted by Sun Lianzhong on the 30th and met with the ambassador at Yanjing University in the afternoon. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Li Zongren at 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Peng Xuepei Arrives in Beijing</h3>
<p>Will Visit the Northwest in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 30th. According to what he told reporters, he has decided to visit the Northwest in the next few days, but the date of the trip has not yet been determined. This trip is a personal action and is not dispatched by the government. As for whether to go to Dihua, he will decide after arriving in Lanzhou.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th) A reporter visited Peng Xuepei and asked if he was dispatched to investigate the Beitashan incident. Peng replied that the local authorities have investigated clearly, and there is absolutely no need to send anyone else to investigate.</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) Deputy Minister of Propaganda Xu Xiaoyan returned to Beijing on the 30th. Xu departed to inspect North China for half a month before returning. The reporter interviewed him and asked about his impressions of inspecting North China. Xu said that the military situation in North China is generally stable, and the National Army is currently firmly defending its strongholds.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollar Black Market Rampant in Qingdao</h3>
<p>(Our Qingdao Dispatch, 30th) After the U.S. dollar was banned, Mayor Li Xianliang, according to the instructions of the Executive Yuan, requested that the U.S. military exchange U.S. dollars for legal tender at the official rate. Consultations with Admiral Cooke did not reach an agreement. Currently, the U.S. dollar black market in Qingdao is extremely rampant. The municipal government is again asking the Executive Yuan for instructions on how to crack down on it.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Seats for Representatives of Professional Groups</h3>
<p>Legislative Yuan's Legal Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) The Legislative Yuan's Legal Committee held a meeting on the 30th, chaired by Liu Ke, to discuss the allocation of seats after the increase in the number of representatives of professional groups. Among them, the number of seats for women's organizations was originally five, but has now been increased to eight. The number of seats for educational organizations has also been increased, and the rest will be increased according to this example. Secondly, the number of seats for women in the National Assembly was discussed. The result was a decision not to make specific provisions. The above decision will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 3rd for discussion.</p>
<h3>Summer Office Hours; No Changes Allowed This Year</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Issues Order to All Agencies</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) The season is approaching summer. Last year, the agencies in the city of Nanjing set summer office hours from July 1 to August 31, that is, from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day, with the afternoon off, adopting a half-day system. This year, after the Chairman ordered that agencies not be allowed to rest in the afternoon, the Executive Yuan issued an order to all agencies on the 30th to comply with.</p>
<h3>Supreme Procuratorate's Wanted Order for Mao Zedong; Confirms Mao as a Traitor; Head of a Major U.S. News Agency Issues Statement</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Yesterday, a reporter met with the head of a major U.S. news agency in this city and asked for his thoughts on the Supreme Court Procuratorate's wanted order for Mao Zedong. He replied that the effect of this move is to confirm that the Chinese Communists are enemies of the state and that Mao Zedong is a traitor. The previous equal status given to the Chinese Communists has been completely cancelled by this move, which is undoubtedly an important measure. As for the direct impact, one is that the hope of peace talks is even more dim, and the other is that military actions on both sides will become more intense. The reporter then asked if the Truman Doctrine has been implemented in China. The person replied that, as of this time, the U.S. government is only satisfying China's needs with a limited amount of military supplies, so the Truman Doctrine has not yet been implemented in China. Future developments may lead to this possibility. As far as I know, the State Department's policy toward China has not yet been finalized, and it is urgently seeking to prevent the aggression of communism in the Far East, but it does not know what method to take. In terms of economic aid to China, the hope of construction loans is not great, because the benefits of construction take time, while the situation in China is too pressing. However, emergency loans to prevent worsening inflation are very likely, but the loan must be attached with a method of supervising its use.</p>
<p>(Our Report) Businessman Wang Xiaolai issued his opinion on the wanted order for Mao Zedong, stating that a wanted order is more appropriate than ordering a general offensive, because ordering a general offensive does not give the Chinese Communists equal status, while a wanted order treats them as ordinary bandits.</p>
<h3>Chairman to Go to Beiping This Week; Zhang Fakui to Come to Shanghai from Guangdong Today and Transfer to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th) Chairman Chiang will definitely come to Beiping this week and stay for about a week. In addition, the Beiping Xingyuan has not yet received instructions regarding the establishment of a summer capital in Beiping this year.</p>
<p>(United Press, Nanjing, 30th) According to sources close to political circles, it is expected that Chairman Chiang will fly to Beiping on the 1st. For the next two months, he will spend most of his time in the Beiping area, so that he can be more closely connected to the war situation and can show that he is very concerned about the well-being of the people of North China. However, this news has not been officially confirmed. Although Beiping will not formally become the summer capital, the Chairman will stay in Beiping for a long time, and many important government officials will definitely go there. It is believed here that the length of the Chairman's stay in North China will depend on the war situation in Beiping. According to well-informed sources, the Chairman originally planned to fly to Beiping earlier, but because the Guomindang Central Standing Committee and Central Political Committee will hold a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 30th, which will be presided over by the Chairman himself to decide national policies, he delayed his departure from Beijing.</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) According to informed sources here, Zhang Fakui, Director of the Guangzhou Xingyuan, will fly from Guangzhou to Shanghai and transfer to Beijing on the 1st to meet with Chairman Chiang for instructions.</p>
<h3>Democratic League Discusses the Current Situation; Believes Peace Talks Are Over</h3>
<p>(Our Report) The Democratic League has held several consecutive Central Standing Committee meetings to carefully discuss the current situation, but has not reached a conclusion. Regarding the Supreme Court's decision to issue a wanted order for Mao Zedong, it is also believed that the road to reconciliation has been cut off, and that the matter of amending the Common Program during the Political Consultative Conference to seek to reopen peace talks is now a thing of the past. The Democratic League's past mediation of peace talks was originally an action to adapt to the political situation. Today, the objective environment has changed, and the focus of work should be placed on developing League affairs.</p>
<h3>Tightening of Grain Administration Agencies; Will Be Further Discussed at Today's Political Affairs Meeting; Revised Draft of Inheritance Tax Law Returned to Ministry of Finance for Revision</h3>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) At the regular meeting of the Political Affairs Conference on the 1st, the total amount of national grain collection for this year will be discussed, and the tightening of grain administration agencies will also be discussed. It is reported that the agricultural and grain agencies in some counties that collect legal tender may be abolished, and the agricultural and grain agencies in some provinces in the Northeast may be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) The revised draft of the Inheritance Tax Law has been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the Executive Yuan believes that the tax threshold of 30 million yuan is still too low and has returned the draft to the Ministry of Finance for revision.</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) In order to strengthen the promotion of taxation, the Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance held a symposium on the 30th, inviting experts and public opinion figures to attend. This was because Shanghai merchants were trying to avoid paying income tax, so the symposium was held. More than 20 people attended, including Liu Zhendong, Ma Xingye, Jian Guansan, and Chen Yaodong. Wang Fuzhou chaired the meeting. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that foreign merchants in Shanghai have paid income tax in accordance with the law, and the Chinese should not evade taxes, so it was advocated that an audit method should be adopted and handled by the Direct Tax Department.</p>
<h3>List of Communist Spies in Chongqing Continues to Be Released by the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th) The Garrison Headquarters announced the fourth batch of Communist spies and their accomplices for whom there is evidence, including eight students from the Rural Construction College and one student from the Central Industrial School. The Rural Construction College is run by Liang Shuming.</p>
<h3>In Coordination with the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, U.S. States Amend Laws; Stipulating That Foreigners Have the Right to Purchase Real Estate</h3>
<p>(U.S. Information Service, New York, 29th) According to the "Far Eastern Survey" biweekly bulletin of the Pacific Society: The states of Nevada and Oregon have amended their laws on land ownership by foreigners in order to implement the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. The treaty was signed in Nanjing last December and has been approved by the Chinese Executive Yuan, but the U.S. Senate has not taken action on it. It stipulates that the people and organizations of each state in the United States should recognize the land rights of Chinese people within that state, otherwise the people and organizations of that state will not be allowed to purchase real estate in China. In the remaining forty-six states, thirty states have already stipulated that foreigners have equal rights to purchase real estate in those states, so there is no conflict with this provision of the Sino-U.S. treaty.</p>
<h3>Howard's Remarks: The Crisis in China is Serious</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, San Francisco, 29th, United Press) Howard, publisher of the Scripps-Howard chain of nineteen newspapers, said here today that the civil war in China is the most serious crisis in the world, and clumsy policy has made it even worse. Howard said that the crisis in China will become more serious in the next six months, and he expressed doubt whether U.S. intervention can resolve the crisis in China. He said that the U.S. continues to misjudge the situation in China and pursue its foolish policy of mediation, and wants to create a miracle of reconciling communism and democracy, which are incompatible like water and oil. This matter cannot succeed in China, just as it cannot succeed in any region of the world. Howard was one of the reporters participating in Pan American Airways' first round-the-world flight. They left New York on the 17th of this month and flew a total of 19,000 miles, passing through Newfoundland, England, Turkey, India, Siam, the Philippines, China, Japan, Guam, Wake Island, Midway Island, and Hawaii. He arrived here today from Honolulu. Howard also said that during this trip, the reporters all believed that it was necessary for us to implement the Hoover Aid Plan and provide aid to the areas most in need. The people in all the places we passed through are asking for support, but they don't know that the U.S. warehouses also have a bottom. Conham, editor of the Boston Christian Science Monitor, also said that the world is not yet one family, and there are still worrying situations and serious problems in the international community, but in any case, some progress has been made. We have found that democracy may become a doctrine of external infusion, just like other philosophies. Today, a delegation of San Francisco civil officials, led by Acting Mayor Ke Hui, went to the airport to welcome the reporters. After a brief introduction, the reporters will go to several welcome receptions specially set up for them. The American-made Constellation aircraft in which they made the round-the-world flight is scheduled to leave here for Chicago at 1:30 AM on the 30th, and then transfer to New York.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Railway Protection Troops Stationed Along the Beining Line</h3>
<p>(Our Tianjin Dispatch, 30th) In order to ensure traffic on the Beining Railway, the authorities have successively sent a large number of railway protection troops, who will be stationed along the Beining Line and assist in the defense of Tianjin and Tanggu.</p>
<h3>Dutch Delegation Arrives in Beijing; Civil Aviation Agreement Negotiations to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) Negotiations on the Sino-Dutch Civil Aviation Agreement will begin soon in Beijing. The head of the Dutch delegation, Dusen, Sibon, Demina, Links, Xu'er, and five others, arrived in Beijing by special plane at 12:15 PM on the 30th. The Ministry of Communications sent Director Dai Anguo of the Civil Aviation Administration and advisor Ling Shifen to be responsible for liaison with them. According to Ling, this agreement will be similar in content to the agreements with the United States and the United Kingdom, with the only difference being the air routes listed in the annex. In addition, the purpose of increasing the Sino-Dutch Airlines routes is to benefit overseas Chinese, and to add routes to the Dutch East Indies and other places. The delegation is scheduled to stay in Beijing for ten days, and will leave after deciding on the basic principles. The delegation is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Wang on the 1st.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Cables Congratulations on Canada's National Day</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th) July 1 is Canada's National Day, and Chairman Chiang sent a congratulatory telegram on the 30th. The original telegram is as follows: "To His Excellency Governor General of Canada, Field Marshal Alexander: On the occasion of the Dominion of Canada's anniversary, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Your Excellency's government and people, and wish your people happiness and prosperity, Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<h3>Rehe Beipiao Coal Mine Repeatedly Besieged by Communist Army</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th) The Beipiao Coal Mine of the Resources Committee is located near Chaoyang, Rehe, and is often harassed by the Communist army. The mine originally had four mining plants, two of which were previously captured. The remaining Taihe and Guanshan mines have also been repeatedly besieged by the Communist army recently. The Taihe mine was again occupied by the Communist army on June 28. The Communist army is still attacking the Guanshan mine and fierce fighting is underway. In addition, the railway line from the mine to Yixian and Jinzhou, with Jinlingsi as the throat, is also under fierce fighting. All the employees of the mine are surrounded and urgently need reinforcements to rescue them.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui and Others Inspect Siping: Suburban Areas a Scene of Scorched Earth and Corpses, Except for Casualties, All Citizens Have Become Refugees</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Siping, 30th] After the great victory at Siping, when the National Army joined forces, Director Xiong Shihui, along with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuming and Chief of Staff Zhao Jiajun, flew to Siping at 5:00 PM on the 30th to inspect the area and express their appreciation to the hard-working military and civilians of the entire city. The reporter accompanied them. At 5:40 PM, they arrived in the skies above Siping. Looking down at the city, the area west of the railroad was a scene of scorched earth, devoid of human presence. Smoke billowed from the vicinity of the train station, and flames blazed. They landed at 5:45 PM, where they were greeted by General Chen Mingren and Chairman Liu Handong. Director Xiong conveyed his regards and expressed sincere concern. General Chen's face was covered in stubble, his temples graying, making him almost unrecognizable. Chairman Liu, known for his stoutness, had visibly slimmed down, but both men's eyes shone brightly, their martial bearing surpassing their former selves, inspiring awe and respect. They then took a car heading westward on the railroad into the city. After traveling only a few yards, the overwhelming stench assaulted them, and the entire group covered their noses with handkerchiefs as they proceeded. Along the way, sentries waved in greeting, their joy evident in their expressions. Upon reaching the outskirts of the city, all the civilian houses were reduced to ruins. Corpses lay everywhere inside and outside the city, a truly tragic sight. As the car passed through the trenches, the corpses piled up within, numbering in the tens of thousands. Witnessing this scene, everyone felt their hair stand on end. After entering the city, they saw dozens of sturdy fortresses stretching for ten miles, all destroyed by artillery fire, a testament to the ferocity of the battle. This was evident. Continuing along Yuanbei Jiyu Li, the Siping Municipal Government, the Liaobei Provincial Government, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the China Three Banks, the Youth Center, the Power Bureau, and other locations were inspected. All the buildings were reduced to rubble, riddled with bullet holes, appearing like tiled windows. Passing by the train station, they saw mountains of soybeans burning and exploding. The cruelty and ruthlessness of the Communist army were infuriating. Half of the houses east of the railroad were reduced to ruins, with only a corner of the headquarters and the provincial chairman's office remaining somewhat intact, but all the buildings were covered in scars. Only a few civilians could be seen on Tiexi Street, their faces haggard, wandering among the rubble as if searching for something. Several dozen civilians could be seen on Tiedong Street, but their faces were all dark and gaunt, clamoring for food. The once magnificent architecture of Siping had completely vanished. Out of the 100,000 residents who once lived comfortably, aside from those who perished or fled, the rest were reduced to refugees. This was truly a great human tragedy. On the way back, they saw 200 soldiers from the Catholic Church surrendering with their hands raised, appearing very disheveled. Among them were dozens of Korean Communists who still displayed an obstinate and ugly demeanor.</p>
<p>General Chen Mingren's Thoughts: Grieving for the People Who Died Unnaturally</p>
<p>When the reporter asked General Chen Mingren for his thoughts, Chen remained silent for a long time, saying, "I have been a soldier for twenty years, and I have never fought such a hard battle, nor have I ever been subjected to so much artillery fire. I can tell the people of the whole country and the world with dozens of captured testimonies that the person commanding the Communist army's siege of Siping this time is undoubtedly an Easterner. No wonder the tactics of the attack were so brilliant, and no wonder the 100,000 artillery shells were so accurate. At the same time, all the artillerymen in the Communist army were Korean Communists, but they still lost, and they lost terribly." When the reporter inquired about the strength of the Communist army's siege, Chen said: "There were the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd divisions of the 1st Column, the 6th division of the 2nd Column, the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 37th divisions of the 3rd Column, plus two security regiments, one independent division, and one or two independent divisions from Songjiang. Except for the entire 3rd Column, which retreated, the rest were annihilated in the Battle of Siping. On the 27th, the 7th Brigade came to reinforce, but within a day, almost half of them were killed or wounded. In total, the Communist army suffered more than 50,000 casualties, while the National Army suffered around 7,000 casualties. However, the National Army originally only had six regiments, so the casualties could only be so many." Chen concluded by saying that this time, the military and civilians of the entire city cooperated seamlessly, weathering the storm together. The affection and sincerity they showed were truly a great victory for the revolutionary spirit. However, many innocent people died unnaturally, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Chairman Liu Expresses His Views: Hopes to Promote the Revolutionary Spirit</p>
<p>The reporter then asked Chairman Liu for his opinion. Chairman Liu first said that this fierce battle was no small matter, and the survival of the Party and the country hinged on this battle. Civil officials have a duty to defend the land, and I dare not take credit, but combat must have the assistance of political forces. This time was the best test. I hope this revolutionary spirit can be carried forward and that no evil forces can hinder it. Now, out of the 100,000 solid citizens, apart from the casualties and those who have taken refuge, half of the rest are waiting to die. This is truly the most tragic event in the world. He immediately asked Director Xiong to provide emergency relief and a large amount of medicine and currency to help the military and civilians. Director Xiong immediately promised to deliver them by plane within a day. The group left Siping at 7:15 PM and returned to Shenyang.</p>

<h3>Graduation Ceremony for Two Classes at the Central Training Corps: Chairman Chiang Attends and Delivers Instructions, Offering "Diligent Practice" as a Parting Gift</h3>

After leading the ceremony, he gave an impromptu speech stating: "Agricultural reclamation and journalism are not only related to military construction, but also to national construction. To build a modern country, in addition to excellent military cadres, there must also be excellent cadres in transportation, agriculture, and industry. Reclamation work is the most important and fundamental of the five essential tasks of national construction. I have already mentioned this in the book 'China's Destiny.' I often think that being able to go to the border areas to be a reclamation worker should be the happiest thing in our lives, because reclamation directly contributes to the country and society. Comrades, from now on, you must concentrate on your work and strive for progress and development in your own work in order to achieve the goal of reclamation and agriculture. Comrades, transforming from military cadres to reclamation cadres is the most ideal national construction cadre, taking on the most important and glorious task. Comrades in the journalism class must understand the importance of their responsibilities. The only important task for journalists is to serve the soldiers, solve their difficulties in life and their spiritual suffering, and pay attention to promoting political education in the army, playing a leading role in thought. The so-called ideological leadership, in addition to theoretical leadership, especially in life and action, must lead by example, leading soldiers to gain the faith of officers and soldiers, and never just talk or write empty articles. Political work is not only theory, but more importantly, it is practice. Only through diligent practice can we succeed. This is true for both national construction and personal careers. I specifically offer the words 'diligent practice' as a parting gift, and I hope you will all strive for it." Everyone listened attentively and was greatly inspired. The ceremony ended at around 11:00 AM.</p>

Now, the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has shortened the five-year cotton production recovery plan to a three-year plan.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Trial of Japanese War Criminals Should End Soon</h3>
<p>The trial of Japanese war criminals at the Far East International Military Tribunal has been adjourned for six weeks, from June 27th to August 4th. Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao and Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun have returned to China to report on their duties during this adjournment. According to Mei, upon arriving in Shanghai: The outside world feels impatient with the Far East International Tribunal's trial of war criminals because it has been delayed for so long, which is understandable. During the trial process, the breadth of the connections involved and the difficulty of collecting evidence were somewhat beyond the expectations of the judges, making the trial situation complicated. He also said that before leaving Tokyo, all the judges of the court invited all the defense lawyers of the defendants to discuss how to speed up the process, and the presiding judge also indicated that it would be completed by the end of the year, but it is not yet known whether this will be achieved. Judging from Mei's remarks and the recent slow progress of the trial, the end time and the outcome of the Japanese war criminal trial are difficult to predict. We are concerned about this major event and feel the need to express our views again.</p>
<p>The Far East International Military Tribunal has been in session for fourteen months, moving from the witness questioning stage to the current debate stage. Japanese war criminals such as Tojo and Doihara have hired multiple Japanese and American lawyers, all legal authorities and the best of their time, to debate the charges. They are engaging in grand rhetoric, creating extraneous issues in everything, intending to delay the time, whitewash their atrocities, and absolve the war criminals. This is as clear as day. According to news reports, on the 10th of this month, the defense lawyers formally requested the International Tribunal to suspend the court for six weeks, citing "the urgent need for time to prepare the remaining defense parts." Presiding Judge Webb and others, affected by the defense lawyers' "fatigue bombing," were already feeling tired, so the request for a break was immediately granted by the presiding judge. Obviously, the defense lawyers will take advantage of this gap to collect new defense materials to overturn the "indictment of Japanese Class A war criminals" submitted by the prosecutors of various countries. Therefore, new developments will inevitably occur in the trial after August 4th, and it is difficult for not only Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao but also Presiding Judge Webb to predict whether it can be concluded this year. As for the delay in the trial time and the gradual disappearance of political significance, whether the final outcome can achieve the results of the Nuremberg Nazi war criminal trials, I am afraid no one can predict. Like this kind of trial that is losing its purpose, British and Soviet public opinion has already expressed dissatisfaction. We have a deep understanding of the crimes of Japanese militarists and are extremely uneasy. We believe that there are several points that must be raised for discussion.</p>
<p>(1) The trial should not be delayed and should be concluded before the peace conference is convened. The editorial of this newspaper on June 1st demanded that the Tokyo Tribunal promptly convict Japanese war criminals and not delay. It pointed out that the extreme cunning of Tojo and Minami Jiro and the cunning and viciousness of Doihara, Matsui, and Umezu make it impossible to obtain reliable materials from the trial. Moreover, the more the time is delayed, the more beneficial it is to the war criminals. In terms of both law and fact, the long-term trial of the Far East International Tribunal is an unnecessary method and should be quickly remedied. Now, MacArthur advocates opening the peace conference and concluding a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. In order to eliminate the uneasy psychology of the Allied countries and enhance the enthusiasm of the Allied people for the peace treaty, we hope that the bright MacArthur and Presiding Judge Webb will promptly conclude the trial after the end of the court adjournment period in order to proceed with the peace conference. If the crimes of Japanese militarists cannot be announced to the world as soon as possible, any plan to tolerate Japan will be difficult to convince the Allied people.</p>
<p>(2) The definition of war criminals cannot be changed. On November 1st last year, the Nuremberg International Tribunal announced the verdict of 22 important Nazi war criminals, which is an important document in international law and has epoch-making academic value. The indictment pointed out that conspiracy to participate in the following behaviors is a war crime that should be hanged: (1) Crimes against peace: including planning, preparing, launching, and executing aggressive wars; (2) War crimes: violating the laws or customs of war; (3) Crimes against humanity: including assassination, massacre, enslavement, expulsion, or inhumane treatment of civilians by inhumane methods before or during wartime, or in political, religious, or racial abuse. According to this definition, which is roughly the same as the joint declaration of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in August 1945, which determined the definition of war criminals, the Tokyo Tribunal should apply this "precedent" and promptly convict Japanese Class A war criminals. For "secondary war criminals" who violate the above-mentioned behaviors, not only should they be "purged," but also prosecutors from various countries should file public prosecutions or send them to the victimized countries for trial. Only in this way can the atrocities of Japanese militarists be completely eliminated, human justice and public reason be upheld, and the principles of international law "aggressive war is a crime" and the definition of war criminals in various countries be maintained.</p>
<p>(3) War criminals who invaded China should be extradited to China for trial. China is an important country that has suffered from the invasion and harm of Japanese militarists. The massacre in Nanjing, the bombing of Chongqing, and the killings in various cities and towns were inhumane. The authenticity of criminal acts cannot be determined without direct accusations from victims. Therefore, we demand the extradition of Class A war criminals such as Doihara, Umezu, Matsui, and a gang of criminals in the adverse consultant Kagesa. We make this claim without any desire for revenge, but to uphold the lofty principles of international law and the correct definition of war criminals. At the same time, in order to reduce the consumption of manpower and resources of the Tokyo Tribunal, this suggestion is also worth considering by those concerned.</p>
<p>War is the extension and continuation of politics. The conviction of war criminals and the determination of war crimes mark the end of the political significance of the war. When the Nuremberg Tribunal tried Nazi war criminals, US President Truman declared: The Nuremberg trial of war criminals was the greatest work of World War II and one of the biggest events of 1946. Truman's view is correct. Therefore, we say that the Tokyo trial of war criminals is one of the biggest events of 1947, and its political significance is significant. The end of the trial of war criminals is the complete end of the war, and what is won is the beginning of peace, the development of justice, and the restoration of the safety, prosperity, and development of human society.</p>

<h3>Soviet Government Instruction Arrives in Paris; Molotov Makes Suggestion; Soviet Union's Opinion Conflicts Sharply with that of Britain and France</h3>
<p>[News from our paper] Paris, 30th (Broadcast): The three foreign ministers held their third meeting today. Bevin and Bidault were on one side, while Molotov was on the other. They have reached the stage of a showdown. If the Soviet Union insists that the United States must determine the scope of assistance to Europe, the meeting may break down.</p>
<p>[News from our paper] Paris, 30th (Broadcast): The three foreign ministers held a meeting today. According to a special correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation, the future of the meeting is bleak. The Soviet Union's attitude is stubborn and runs counter to that of Britain and France. Molotov stated that the British and French plans would infringe upon the interests of European countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Observers believe that today's meeting of the three foreign ministers may reach a turning point. It is reported that the one-day break on Sunday is intended to allow Bevin and Bidault ample time to study Molotov's suggestions on the aid to Europe plan. Molotov made this suggestion after receiving instructions from his government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] The Paris meeting of the three foreign ministers, discussing Marshall's economic aid plan, almost reached a stalemate tonight because the Soviet Union refused to agree to it until the United States guaranteed that it would not have any political effects. The three foreign ministers will now hold their third meeting at 4 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Experts from the British, French, and Soviet delegations studied various proposals made in the two meetings of the three foreign ministers on Sunday. Molotov is still seeking instructions from Moscow. It is expected that no definite progress can be made until Molotov receives instructions from his government. Judging from the meetings of the first two days, there seems to be a distance between handling the Marshall Plan from a political standpoint. But everyone seems to be prepared to conduct non-political research on practical needs. The fear that the Soviet delegation would hinder the Marshall Plan has now been dispelled. Molotov made quite concrete suggestions at the meeting on Saturday, allowing the three delegations to jointly study the proposals made by the three countries on Sunday. According to reliable information, Molotov did ask the United States to clarify its future assistance to Europe and guarantee that the US Congress could approve such plans. However, Britain is opposed to asking the United States such questions at the current stage, believing that this will create technical errors and hinder the completion of the final goal. Another fundamental Soviet principle that has not yet been put forward at this meeting is that the plan should be based on the needs of individual countries, and these countries should be free to deal with such assistance under the sovereign integrity of the country. The Soviet Union, in a practical stance, does not oppose the study of the special state of European economic problems in principle. The hope that the three-power conference can reach a quick resolution is based on this. After studying the opinions of the three countries, the experts of the three countries can generally understand how to form a compromise to establish a European Economic Design Committee. At that time, Bevin will decide whether the proposed establishment of a mechanism is suitable for the needs of effectiveness and urgency.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 29th] Regarding the meeting of the three foreign ministers for several days to discuss the aid to Europe plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall, people close to the meeting of the three foreign ministers said: Although the Paris meeting has developed to a difficult stage, the three foreign ministers may change their original decision when they meet tomorrow afternoon, that is, not to keep the situation of the meeting secret. According to the agreement, the three foreign ministers had reached an agreement not to publish the results of the meeting, but it was broken by the Soviet side. The Soviet TASS News Agency intended to publish the progress of the meeting, creating an impression that the meeting of the three foreign ministers had reached a stalemate. In any case, the hope that the meeting of the three foreign ministers can reach an agreement is very slim. The Soviet Union stands on one side, while Britain and France stand on the other. The British delegation seems extremely pessimistic about the meeting of the three foreign ministers. According to a representative: "We have reached a critical stage. Our views are very different from those of the Soviet Union. We really don't know how the meeting of the three foreign ministers will end." The French delegation is also not very optimistic. According to the attitudes of Britain and France, it is believed that Germany's needs and its production capacity must be taken into account in order to cope with the suggestions put forward by Secretary of State Marshall.</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Union Face Off on the European Reconstruction Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 29th] It is learned today that if the United States undertakes to fund the reconstruction of Europe to stem the spread of communism, the Soviet Union will apparently adopt a policy of promoting soaring prices as a means of resistance. Qualified observers here unanimously believe that, based on the interpretation of the Moscow reports, the initial Soviet action seems to be asking US Secretary of State Marshall to lay his cards on the table to ascertain how much financial support the US can provide when various corners of Europe draft aid plans, and what kind of backing Marshall has from the American people and Congress, or whether it is just empty talk. This Soviet move will be the beginning of an international poker game, requiring Marshall to put down more huge chips, with the leadership position of the US and the Soviet Union in Europe as stakes. The strength of the US government's preparation to support Marshall's proposal can be seen in the arrangements for welcoming two important government officials here. US Secretary of Commerce Harriman and Secretary of Agriculture Anderson are scheduled to arrive in Berlin on July 2nd, leading a team of experts to study the economic situation in Western Europe. Their itinerary includes the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Among these, except for the Netherlands and Belgium, there is a severe shortage of essential goods. Except for the Netherlands, all have experienced multiple political disturbances since the war, and it is expected that they will intensify in the future. The threat of communism heavily looms over Europe, and Soviet political influence has been advancing in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Various Countries Dare Not Have High Hopes for the Foreign Ministers' Conference</p>
<p>A United Press survey of the reactions of various countries to the Paris Conference shows that these countries are watching the prospects of the conference with a cold and pessimistic attitude. Among them, the German people are quite worried about whether the Marshall Plan can have concrete results. Since the Moscow Conference ended in failure, they cannot help but express a cool attitude towards whether the Paris Conference can resolve the fundamental differences in economic issues. The Italian people are equally skeptical. It is said that the major powers have failed to find a basis for cooperation in the past, so they dare not have high hopes for this American proposal. The general public in Belgium believes that if the Paris Conference fails to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, the whole world will tend towards a major disaster. The Netherlands no longer needs food, but needs building materials, textiles, and machinery. The United Kingdom and France are extremely concerned about the Marshall Plan because they need tools to produce wheat, coal, and electricity, and also need transportation. As for the Soviet Union, according to an American reporter who has lived in Moscow for five years, the purpose of the Soviet representatives participating in the Paris Conference is nothing more than to demand what the Soviet Union has always demanded, namely German reparations and joint control of the Ruhr area. The Moscow Conference turned a deaf ear to the Soviet Union's request for $10 billion in reparations from Germany and joint control of the Ruhr industrial area by the four countries, and now they will bring up the old matter again.</p>
<h3>Pope Endorses Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press Vatican City, 30th] When the Pope received the new British Ambassador to the Holy See, Mr. Berowne, today, he said: "The European reconstruction plan based on re-establishing cooperative relations with former enemies should be implemented as soon as possible. Further delays will be detrimental to both the victors and the vanquished." People here believe that the Pope's words are a complete endorsement of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Greek Foreign Minister to the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters Athens, 29th] When the United Nations Security Council discusses the report of the Balkan Investigation Committee, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris will personally lead a delegation to attend. Mr. Tsai flew to Geneva today en route to New York.</p>
<h3>Five Powers Fail to Reach Agreement on the Issue of International Military Personnel</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 30th] It is learned today that the United Nations Military Staff Committee can submit to the Security Council tonight the first formal estimate of the number of future international peacekeeping vehicles. It is reported that the committee members of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union have failed to reach an agreement. It is widely believed that the United States, the United Kingdom, and China advocate that the number of international standby troops should be between one million and three million. The Soviet Union insists that it should not be too many and that the principle of strict equal distribution among countries should be maintained. France is only willing to provide one infantry division. Based on this, the international peacekeeping force will be about 70,000 people.</p>
<h3>US-Canada Joint Defense Prepares for Arctic Exercises</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th] Authoritative sources in the Department of the Army recently announced that the United States and Canada will soon announce plans for joint Arctic exercises in the winter to guard against possible attacks from the Arctic region. At present, the United States and Canada are cooperating in military and diplomatic aspects, and since the establishment of the joint defense plan, the United States has sold a large amount of military supplies to Canada at low prices, including Flying Fortresses, tanks, batteries, transportation, hospitals, and other equipment. The US-Canada joint defense has the following provisions:</p>
<p>(1) Exchange experts to study the defense characteristics within each other's territory. (2) Study common plans to unify military equipment, organization, training, etc. (3) Mutually benefit from the use of military equipment such as land, sea, and air within each other's territory. (4) Open aviation bases, land transportation, and highway networks on the way from the United States to Alaska.</p>
<h3>American Progressive Citizens' Society Calls for the Formation of a New Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 29th Special Dispatch] The "American Progressive Citizens' Society," established last year and blessed by Wallace, has recently requested all independent political groups in the United States to show a spirit of cooperation in the upcoming general election regarding progressive presidential candidates, and "if necessary, to call for it with a new party." If the threat of organizing a third party proposed by the "American Progressive Citizens' Society" is implemented, it will greatly reduce Truman's chances of being elected president in the coming year, as Mr. Du will therefore lose many votes from the free left.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Speech Disrupted by Leftists</h3>
<p>[United Press Venice, 29th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi gave a speech at an outdoor rally of the Catholic Democratic Party today. Left-wing Communist and Socialist masses poured into the venue and clashed with the police. One police chief, ten police officers, and many demonstrators were injured as a result. Amidst the turmoil, Mr. Jia continued his speech for half an hour, repeatedly asking the more than 9,000 people to observe order and criticizing the narrow-mindedness and intolerance of the Communist and Socialist parties. Later, because the conflict could not be stopped, the police used tear gas. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed, and the smoke blew towards the San Marco Square separated by the police where the Democratic Party members were located, and the meeting dispersed.</p>
<h3>President Auriol of Europe Fetes British and Soviet Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Paris, 29th] French President Auriol hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace today for British Foreign Secretary Bevan and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Other attendees included British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper, Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov, US Ambassador to France Caffery, French Foreign Minister Bidault, and many French dignitaries.</p>
<h3>The US Government Must Lead the People to Eliminate Racial Discrimination and Strengthen Democracy - Truman Emphasizes This Point in His Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th] President Truman said today at the closing meeting of the 38th Annual Conference of the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" at the Lincoln Memorial: The US government must lead the elimination of racial prejudice and discrimination among the people at home to strengthen the democratic movement abroad. State governments and local governments should indeed earnestly protect civil rights, but the people of the whole country can no longer wait for the most backward states or the most stubborn societies to follow suit, but should be advocated by the federal government. There are still many people in the United States who are insulted and threatened. The conscience and judicial system of the American nation have not yet enabled every person to obtain complete freedom from fear.</p>
<p>The people of various countries suffering from soldiers abroad are struggling on the line of life and death. These people are of great importance to our continued pursuit of a peaceful solution to world problems and must be made to accept a free way of life. It is not easy to teach freedom to the suffering people of all countries. If we cannot prove the rigidity of democracy, these people will be easily seduced by the false security of totalitarian regimes when they are hungry and do not choose their food. The democratic movement we advocate must be very strong and sound. This depends on whether we can first govern our country and provide concrete evidence before we can achieve success. Du (Zengmenxuan proposed the following steps to improve civil rights protection: (1) The advisory committee organized by five Americans last December will definitely formulate effective and reasonable plans for the entire country to follow. (2) A bill will be submitted to Congress to enable the people of Guam and Sorma Island to obtain basic civil rights and share our ideals of freedom and autonomy. This move and all subsequent laws are sufficient to demonstrate to other countries that we trust that all mankind has the ability to build a free entity. The President also said: Representatives of freedom-loving countries on the United Nations Human Rights Commission are drafting the "International Human Rights Code." The representatives of various countries, including Mrs. Roosevelt, are all famous figures, and the code they have drafted will be a major milestone in the long journey of mankind to fight for freedom. Mrs. Roosevelt concluded her speech by saying: The stain of lynching blacks in the United States must be eradicated so that democracy can be implemented soundly. The United Nations People's Committee adheres to the principle of "all mankind are brothers" and wants to build a world "where all mankind can live as brothers," which depends on the help of the United States.</p>
<h3>Holy Land Investigation Team Plans to Visit Transjordan</h3>
<p>British Troops Attacked by Jewish Terrorist Party</p>
<p>[French News Agency Jerusalem, 29th] Well-informed sources here recently said that the chairman of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, Swedish Judge Sandstrom, will visit Transjordan's Abdullah. At that time, he may contact him about the investigation committee's visit to the capital of Transjordan.</p>
<p>[United Press Jerusalem, 29th] It was officially announced that five British soldiers were sunbathing in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, when they were attacked by gunfire from Jewish underground members. Two officers were injured, one in the head, and two other soldiers, one seriously injured and one slightly injured. The rioters escaped under the cover of smoke bombs. Last night, four British soldiers were attacked by terrorist parties and were seriously injured and fatally wounded. This happened only eighteen hours apart. According to the terrorist party, this was in retaliation for the disappearance of a sixteen-year-old Jew named Lobowitz on May 6. The Palestinian authorities said that they had no way of finding out the whereabouts of this Jewish youth and that he was probably no longer alive.</p>
<h3>France Cracks Down on Coup Conspiracy Attempts to Attack Paris to Establish a Dictatorship Many Senior Military and Political Officials Arrested</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 30th] The French National Security Police announced this morning that they had uncovered a large-scale conspiracy to overthrow the French government in July and replace it with a dictatorship. Many senior military and political officials were also involved in the case, but their names were not announced. The most active areas of the conspirators were Brittany and the northern coast of Langyuan, and the investigation is about to be completed. Twelve hours before this announcement, rumors were rife in Paris that there would be shocking arrests, martial law would be declared, and a large number of cabinet members would resign. It is reported that one of the leaders of the conspirators was a retired officer, a former subordinate of Petain. In addition, six or seven French government officials were actively involved in these conspiracies. It is reported that most of their names will be announced on the same day. According to the security police, the conspirators planned to launch a coup in mid-July. The rebel army will launch a lightning attack on Paris from centers such as Rennes and Vannes to seize key points. Political prisoners such as the telephone bureau, telegraph bureau, and Fresnes prison will be released. After the rebel army enters Paris, it will establish a dictatorship and immediately implement new laws. The security police have also obtained a list of the rebel government to replace the Lamadie government. It is reported that this conspiracy was discovered after the French police searched the residence of Volban, the editor of "French Activities Weekly," on June 24 and obtained many conspiracy documents. Volban has been arrested.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 30th] The arrested suspects are all right-wing people and have nothing to do with General de Gaulle's recently organized French People's Party. According to news from the city of Brittany, those arrested include retired veterans and national leaders such as Volban. The party leader is a friend of former Marshal Petain. When the police searched a private residence in Brittany, they found many drafts of lists of foreign government personnel and decrees and regulations, usurping the name "Five Executive Cabinets." The Five Executive Cabinets were organized in accordance with the Constitution of 1795 during the French Revolution from 1795 to 1799.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Paris, 30th] Observers here said that the conspiracy to overthrow the government discovered by the French police may have international relations and involve first-class figures. The police authorities announced today that they have arrested General Girodaux, the former commander of the French Gendarmerie, Major Zenggen, and Father Rothe. A large number of weapons were hidden in the priest's residence. The police started searching this case six months ago and only announced it today. The cracking of this conspiracy may completely change the political situation in France, and it is expected that the case will still have major developments.</p>
<h3>Hiroshima Sings and Dances in Peace to Commemorate the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Tokyo, 30th] Hiroshima residents will hold a celebration ceremony on the second anniversary of the US bombing of Japan with the first atomic bomb, including dancing, singing, and fireworks. The celebration will last for three days, from August 5 to 7. The Mayor of Hiroshima and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce will personally ask Emperor Hirohito to attend the grand ceremony. The organizers also plan to invite American officials to participate.</p>
<h3>UNRRA's European Operations Were Declared Closed Yesterday Relief Supplies Worth a Total of US$300 Million</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Washington, 29th] UNRRA Director General General Rooks declared today that all hope for the relief of war-stricken countries now rests on the economic aid plan for Europe recently proposed by US Secretary of State Marshall and the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in Paris. After the end of the war, UNRRA distributed relief supplies to war-stricken countries and will now cease operations on June 30. Since the beginning of its work, UNRRA has distributed relief supplies worth US$300 million to European countries. Speaking of the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in Paris, the political differences between the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France constitute a serious obstacle to the economic progress of the world.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th] The work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Europe will end on June 30, but in the Pacific, relief will continue in China, Korea, and the Philippines to complete its plan, which is expected to take several months until late autumn. UNRRA's work has far exceeded its original budget, and the funds spent are no less than US$3.67 billion, of which US$530 million is designated for relief in China, which is the largest amount. In addition, the number in the Pacific is limited, totaling US$10.33 million for the Philippines and US$1 million for Korea. 75% of the relief plan for China has been completed, and the materials that have been shipped or are ready to be shipped account for about 83%. There are still more than 17% of the funds available.</p>
<h3>General Strike in Uruguay</h3>
<p>[Reuters Montevideo, 30th] Fifty-three trade union organizations in Uruguay have ordered their workers to implement a 24-hour general strike on Monday in protest against the recently passed anti-strike law. Emergency services will be maintained at that time, and the authorities have taken precautionary measures throughout the country upon receiving the news.</p>
<h3>Dutch Governor Reaffirms Policy to Promote the Establishment of the East Indies Federation Sokarno Appoints Shari as Advisor</h3>
<p>[Our report] London 30th Broadcast: The Indonesian military announced today that in the past two days, the Dutch army has been constantly shelling the positions of the Indonesian army 25 miles west of Surabaya. Also on June 25, the two armies exchanged fire for five hours.</p>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 30th] Dutch East Indies Governor Van Mook declared today that the Dutch government has clarified its policy towards the East Indies, with the aim of establishing the East Indies Federation and making it an independent country. Van Mook said at a press conference that the Netherlands believes that the Dutch proposal of May 27 is a "reasonable and possible solution to the Indonesian problem and facilitates the rapid and effective construction of a new country." He regretted that the final reply from Indonesia did not address several key points, including the future diplomatic relations of Indonesia. Van Mook also expressed his regret for the resignation of Indonesian Prime Minister Shari, who had "completed a very good task in the past," and he admitted that Mr. Sha's resignation "makes the event seem to be in a deadlock." Van Mook also said that the American note submitted by US Consul Fuder to Indonesian Education Minister Su Hongdi was a "timely and helpful" move, especially since this note was proposed by an important government of a third country. The American note strongly advocated a quick solution and allowed for economic assistance to the Dutch East Indies, "which is in line with the outline of our policy." Regarding Eastern Indonesia and Western Borneo, Van said: "We cannot avoid responsibility for these areas or avoid responsibility for the people living in the Republican government area who hope to compromise." He avoided answering whether the American note contained a time limit for reply. When asked if the situation would be more relaxed if Shari returned to office, he replied: It depends on what circumstances he returns to office. At the same time, the Dutch Anida News Agency said that President Sokarno has appointed Shari in Yogyakarta as a presidential advisor. Sokarno also sent letters to the leaders of the four major political parties, requesting them to organize a new cabinet at 6 pm on Tuesday. The letter was sent to Social Party leader Sharifuddin and Dr. Gani of the Nationalist Party, both of whom were cabinet members of the previous Shari cabinet. The other two party leaders are Dr. Masjumi (Muslim) and Dr. Setijito of the Labor Party. According to Indonesian sources, Sharifuddin is likely to be the new prime minister. Republican officials in Batavia told the Dutch news agency that Shari's appointment as presidential advisor shows that the president fully trusts Mr. Sha's policies and is willing to see them implemented.</p>
<p>[United Press Yogyakarta, 30th] Indonesian Republic President Sukarno issued a statement today calling on the four major political parties in the country to organize a joint cabinet by tomorrow night to cope with the current emergency situation. At the same time, Indonesian leaders continued to consider the American note. Some people expressed concern about the original text of the note, believing that it was very different from the telegram received yesterday, which stated: "The United States believes that it is urgently needed to establish an Indonesian provisional central government immediately based on the federal foundation proposed by the Dutch government and accepted in principle by the Indonesian Republic." However, the words "Dutch government" and "accepted in principle" were omitted from the telegram, becoming "based on the federal foundation proposed by the Indonesian Republic," which completely changed the meaning.</p>
<h3>North Korean Conference Opens</h3>
<p>Soviet Representative Accuses Reactionaries</p>
<p>[New Asia Agency Seoul, 30th] The joint meeting of the US-Soviet Joint Committee and the North Korean democratic political parties and social organizations was held at 2 pm on the 30th in the conference hall of the North Korean People's Committee. The flags of Korea and the Soviet Union were hung high in front of the venue. At 1:50 pm, Kim Doo-bong, Chairman of the People's Committee, arrived at the venue. At 2 pm, General Kim Il-sung, the supreme leader of North Korea, entered the venue, followed by General Morotkov, commander of the Soviet stationed army, and representatives from the US and Soviet sides. Morotkov said in his speech: "The Korean people have been under Japanese rule for more than 40 years. We should not only relieve their suffering, but also make them truly free and liberated." US representative Major General Brown said: "My expectations for the people of North Korea are higher than those for the people of South Korea. I believe that through the efforts of the gentlemen in North Korea, all problems can be expected to be resolved." Soviet representative Shitikov said: "Now some reactionaries are hindering the establishment of a provisional government, but the absolute majority of the people are looking forward to the establishment of a provisional government and hope to receive assistance from the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom."</p>
<h3>US Engineers to Study Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>Completing the Entire Project Will Take Two Years</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 30th] An independent US engineering survey committee is expected to arrive in Tokyo this month to conduct a "final" investigation of Japan's reparations issue. The committee includes private businessmen and technicians, and may also include members of the Schuler Committee, which inspected Japanese industry in February. Although the committee only has the right to make recommendations and no other powers, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces still strongly hopes to have the views of an independent group before dealing with 30% of the temporary compensation. According to well-informed sources, the committee will focus on the future of Japanese industry and, at the request of the Allied Headquarters, study the factories that should be used for reparations. Delegations from China, the Philippines, and other countries are extremely impatient to wait for compensation. The entire compensation plan will take about two years to complete.</p>
<h3>The Opposition Launches a Full-Scale Offensive: The Katayama Cabinet Faces a Test; Shigeru Yoshida to Grill on Anti-Communism</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The first session of the Japanese Diet will formally enter the deliberation stage on July 1st. After Prime Minister Katayama's policy speech, the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, Wada, will explain the emergency economic countermeasures, replacing the usual Minister of Finance's address, and a white paper will be used to explain the essence of the crisis. On July 2nd, each party will begin questioning the Prime Minister's speech, with the President of the Liberal Party, Shigeru Yoshida, the Socialist Party's Kanju Kato, the Democratic Party's Tokutaro Kitamura, the People's Cooperative Party's Kyoji Funada, the Farmers' Party's Masaoki Tsunashima, and the Communist Party's Kyuichi Tokuda taking the lead. According to well-informed sources, Yoshida will engage in hand-to-hand combat with the Social Democratic parties, directly raising anti-communist questions in an attempt to demonstrate the power of the opposition party. Kato, as a central figure of the Socialist Party's left wing, is expected to present his questions from the standpoint of a left-wing representative. Kitamura Tokutaro will raise questions about the state management of coal mines, and the government's response will affect the unity of the ruling parties. On the questioning session of July 3rd, the Chairman of the Liberal Party's General Affairs Committee, Jiro Hoshijima, is expected to raise questions on coal trade issues, among others. Finally, the Communist Party representative, Kyuichi Tokuda, will also use a unique strategy, from the pure standpoint of the opposition party, to challenge the Katayama cabinet as an anti-communist regime. In addition, each faction of the House of Councillors will nominate twelve representatives to ask questions, and if there is enough time, they may rise to ask questions immediately after the Prime Minister's speech on the 1st, and seem to be drastically different from the previous House of Peers, expressing their determination to break through the current situation.</p>
<p>Coal Mine Nationalization Issue Causes Intense Party Disputes</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The biggest difficulty for the Katayama Cabinet in the Diet lies in the Liberal Party's all-out attack, but there are also some disagreements between the government and the ruling parties on some minor issues. For example, regarding the coal mine issue, the Socialist Party advocates state management with nationalization as a premise, while the Democratic Party advocates state management with private ownership as a premise, and believes that state management is predicated on increased production. If there is no concrete assurance of increased production, state management should not be implemented immediately. If the resolution of this issue is flawed, it will create rifts in the three-party coalition cabinet.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Intensifies Efforts to Seize Economic Control in Hungary; Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés Delivers Campaign Speech</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 29th] As the approval period of the Hungarian peace treaty and the withdrawal period of the Soviet troops gradually approach, the Soviet Union's acquisition of economic control in Hungary has also intensified.

The Soviet Union obtains its economic control through the following methods: (1) through Hungarian-Soviet joint companies with Soviet personnel retaining control; (2) through German property in Hungary that should be confiscated under the Potsdam Agreement; (3) obtaining control of banks and insurance companies; (4) indirectly controlling Hungarian industry through Hungarian Communist Party cabinet members and other Communist Party officials. Through these methods, the Soviet Union has already gained strong control over Hungarian industry and intends to completely dominate Hungary's economy before the Soviet troops withdraw from Hungary.</p>

(2) Labor's Children school should be established as soon as possible. (3) Employees should be provided with boots needed for work. (4) The employer should be ordered to follow the special leave and bereavement leave methods stipulated by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee. (5) The employer should be ordered to allocate kerosene on a regular basis. (6) Returning employees should have their original salaries and seniority restored. Section Chief Fan considered the first demand reasonable and promised that the Social Affairs Bureau would negotiate with the company. Points two, three, and five were welfare issues and promised to convene labor-management discussions. The fourth point was a legal issue and would be supervised by the Evaluation Committee for implementation. The sixth point could not be discussed because these were all people who had been dismissed during the occupation by the Japanese, due to illness, fraud, or other negligence. After the victory, the Social Affairs Bureau found ways to restore their work with the treatment of new workers. Because they had an employment relationship with the enemy, past seniority was not counted. After the worker Union Acting Chairman Xu Shijian relayed Section Chief Fan's response to the workers, they initially expressed dissatisfaction and demanded that they be given a guarantee before they would leave. Then, after persuasion by Section Chief Fan and Zhu Shunhao, the petitioning team left the bureau at 12:30 PM. The first tramcar left the company at 1:30 PM, and tramcars on all routes fully resumed service after 2:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Another Case of Smuggling Yun Soil by Air - Drug Dealers Arrested at Hongqiao Airport - Five Accomplices Also Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At 6:00 PM on the 28th of last month, the Police Bureau's Detective Section arrested Zhang Dongchen (also known as Liu Wenhua), a drug dealer who had arrived in Shanghai from Kunming on a China National Aviation Corporation transport plane. Thirty-five taels of pure Yun soil were seized from his travel bag on the spot. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, five accomplices and suspects, Zi Ming (31 years old, from Fujian, graduated from the 5th class of the Air Force), Liu Shende, Xu Shilong, Liu Weimin, and Ling Yu氏, were arrested at No. 35, Jiufu Lane, Jiangyin Road, No. 6, Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road, and No. 9, Yukang Lane, Shouning Road. According to Zhang's confession, he is 35 years old and from Kunming.</p>
<p>He is a cloth merchant. In February of this year, he met Wang Ziming, a retired Air Force officer, through a friend in Kunming. They hit it off, and talked about the high price of "soil" in Shanghai. If they could find a way to smuggle it to Shanghai by air, they could make a huge profit. Because Wang was from the Air Force, he immediately promised to find a plane seat. So, the two of them jointly invested 600,000 yuan, and bought twenty taels of opium at a price of 30,000 yuan per tael from Yang Shenzhi at No. 15, Minsheng Lane, outside the South Gate of Kunming.</p>
<p>They tried smuggling it, and the result was quite successful. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhang stayed at the Dahu Hotel on Zhongzheng Road, and Wang stayed at his friend's house at No. 35, Jiufu Lane, Jiangyin Road. Later, they were introduced to Xu Shilong, and then Xu introduced them to Zhang Lin氏, a woman, to whom they sold the opium for 80,000 yuan per tael, earning 1.6 million yuan. The two of them split the money equally. In April of this year, Zhang went to Kunming alone to smuggle once. On the 16th of last month,</p>
<p>They cooperated again. Zhang flew to Kunming and bought forty taels of opium (35 taels net weight), and when he arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 28th, he was discovered by F俊厚, the chief of the Detective Section of the Police Bureau, who dispatched Feng Qishan, Zhang Changgui and other staff to wait at Hongqiao Airport to apprehend him. The investigation of all the perpetrators has now been completed, and they will be transferred to the District Court for interrogation today.</p>
<h3>Overseas Soviet Citizens in Shanghai Granted Permission to Return to Their Country - Provided with Travel Expenses, Employment Assistance, and Various Conveniences</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Russian-language newspaper in this city issued an extra edition at noon yesterday, carrying a notice from the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai stating that the Soviet government has decided to allow 3,000 overseas Soviet citizens in Shanghai and their families to return to their homeland within this year. All Soviet citizens returning to their country will immediately be given employment by the government according to their respective identities, provided with housing, food, and other necessities. Poor overseas citizens can also be granted loans to enable them to start a livelihood. All return expenses will be borne by the government, and the luggage and personal belongings of overseas citizens will be exempt from customs inspection upon entering the country. After learning of this news, Soviet citizens in this city held a grand gathering at the Soviet Overseas Chinese Association on Pershing Road at 8:00 PM last night to celebrate. According to the Russian-language newspaper, most Soviet citizens will take this opportunity to return to their country. According to the household registration statistics of the Police Bureau in this city, there are more than 7,000 Soviet citizens in the city. Now that the Soviet government has allowed 3,000 overseas citizens and their families to return to their country, it is tantamount to enabling all Soviet citizens in Shanghai to return to their country. In addition, the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai also announced yesterday that it will allow 150 White Russian orphans in Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin to be sent back to the Soviet Union within this year.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Factory Owner Tragically Shot Dead - First Interrogation of Gu Weijun - Defendant Denies Firing Gun, Claims Accidental Discharge - Prosecutor Ding to Inspect Scene of Incident This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At 0:30 AM on June 24th, a dispute occurred in front of the Hongqiao Grand Theater, followed by Gu Weijun, a volunteer policeman from the Xujiahui District, going to the home of Wang Wanshun, the old shopkeeper of the Shunxing Dyeing Factory (currently the director of the Hand-made Cotton Weaving Industry Union), and shooting Wang, injuring him. He was sent to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment, but died on the 28th due to excessive blood loss. The family of the victim filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office accusing the volunteer policeman of homicide. The defendant was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office by the police bureau for investigation. Wang was from Anhui. Yang Hu, Chairman of the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, and Fang Zhi, Director of the Municipal Party Department, sent official letters to the District Prosecutor's Office, stating that Gu's arbitrary shooting and killing was extremely illegal. In addition to Wang Zhenxiong, the son of the victim, publishing a statement in the newspaper to clarify the truth, they requested the court to handle the case strictly in accordance with the law. Prosecutor Ding Tongjun conducted the first interrogation of the case yesterday. In addition to questioning the defendant Gu Weijun, he also summoned Wang Zhenxiong, the son of the victim, and Zheng Zixin, Xu Shanggao, Sun Daonan, Sun Yougao and other employees of the factory who witnessed Gu shooting. According to the plaintiff's side, on the night of the 23rd, policemen from the Xujiahui Police Station knocked on the door, accusing Zheng Zhenxiong of causing trouble at the Hongqiao Grand Theater, and slapped him in the face. His father, Wang Wanshun, came to his rescue and argued with them. Unexpectedly, the policeman [blank space] fired a pistol, and the bullet entered Wang Wanshun's abdomen, fatally injuring him. The defendant Gu Weijun denied firing the gun, claiming that the pistol was accidentally discharged, and that the shooter was another policeman. Prosecutor Ding, believing that the defendant was highly suspected of committing a crime, ordered him to be detained. The witnesses were ordered to return. He scheduled to go to the scene of the incident this morning for inspection, and to summon the director of the Xujiahui Branch and other policemen who went to Wang's house with Gu at the same time, in order to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Cathay Theater Shareholders Meeting Fails</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Cathay Theater is operated by Lianyi Company. On the 28th of last month, the company held a shareholders' meeting. When the chairman reported on the accounts, the fees for accountants and lawyers reached a huge amount of more than US$21,000, which aroused inquiries from the shareholders. After checking the accounts, it was found that the lawyer's fees of more than US$18,000 were part of the expenses personally spent by He Tingran (who arbitrarily served as the managing director of the China United Film Company during the enemy and puppet period, and was reported by others after the victory). The shareholders believed that He was using public funds for private purposes and insisted on not approving it, so the shareholders' meeting was declared adjourned. It is said that the company's stock has a face value of US$30, but last year each share only received 6,700 yuan in national currency, which led to the dispute.</p>

<h3>Punishing War Criminals is Not Revenge - Ministry of National Defense Telegraphed to Military Tribunals Prohibiting Parade Before Execution - Rumor of Li Liang's Removal is Untrue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] When the Japanese war criminals "Wolf of Changshu" Mura Haruki and "Tiger of Jiangyin" Shimoda Jiro were executed on the 17th of this month, the military tribunal paraded the two criminals through the streets before the execution, causing a sensation throughout the city. It was rumored that the authorities were deeply dissatisfied with this "wolf and tiger parade" because it was attacked by foreign newspapers, so they removed the head of the tribunal, Li Liang, and appointed Shi Meiyu, the head of the Nanjing Military Tribunal, to replace him, scheduled to take over today. It is now learned that the rumor of the removal is untrue. Since Li Liang has been the head of the military tribunal, he has carried out the trial of war criminals in a difficult situation of tight funding, and his achievements have been outstanding. He is still holding the position as usual. However, recently, the Ministry of National Defense, considering that the purpose of punishing war criminals is to maintain humanitarian justice and protect the dignity of international law, and not to implement revenge, has indeed telegraphed all military tribunals across the country, prohibiting the parade of war criminals before execution and prohibiting the use of retaliatory words and sentences in official documents, such as inappropriate measures such as "to satisfy the people's hearts".</p>

<h3>Nighttime Knife Attack - Rickshaw Puller Killed by Robber</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhou Shengchang, 18 years old, unemployed, from Haimen, is temporarily residing with relatives at No. 3, Lane 199, Jinan Road, who run a rickshaw repair shop. On the 29th, he picked up a rusty butcher knife, about a foot long, near his residence, and took it to the Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 345, Shunchang Road to sharpen it. He hid it on his person, and went out for a stroll on the street after dinner that day. At around 3:00 AM the next morning, he suddenly encountered rickshaw puller Zhang Susheng (23 years old, from Nantong, residing at No. 48, Lanxin Lane, Ximen Road) at the intersection of Ximen Road and Jinan Road. Zhou immediately hired the rickshaw, stating that he would pay 11,000 yuan to go to Hefei Road. After arriving at the entrance of No. 568 on that road, Zhou suddenly pulled out the butcher knife and stabbed Zhang twice in the back, penetrating his chest. At that time, although Zhang was seriously injured, he shouted for help loudly. The murderer abandoned the knife and tried to escape. Dai Yifu, a police officer from the Sige Police Station in the nearby alley, heard the sound and rushed to the scene, immediately arresting Zhou and taking him to the Songshan Police Station. After receiving the report, Shen Zuoluo, the chief of the Criminal Division of the bureau, personally led the officers to investigate. Zhang Liansheng had already died, so the body car was sent to the autopsy station for examination. The murderer Zhou Shengchang confessed to the above process, admitting to killing Zhang, saying that the purpose was to rob the rickshaw he was driving.</p>

<h3>Shameless Woman Buried with Husband Under the Knife</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Fei Yinfeng, a woman from Ningbo, 40 years old, residing at No. 46, Huaanfang, Huaxing Road, Zhabei, married her fellow villager Dai Zhenbao (41 years old, a coppersmith) and had a daughter, Lin Xiang, 16 years old. During the Anti-Japanese War, Dai went to work in the interior, and there was no news of him for six or seven years. Fei had difficulty making a living, and lived with Gu Ajin. Soon after, she left and became acquainted with Zhang Shengcai (48 years old), a Ningbo chef. Last winter, Dai Zhenbao suddenly returned to Shanghai and worked for the water transport team of the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Yinfeng shuttled between the two, and still occasionally went to Zhang Shengcai's residence on the upper floor of the Luo Yi Coal Store at No. 514, Anqing Road, to spend the night.

<h3>Central Government Revises Method for Recovering Land Purchased by Enemy and Puppet Regimes - Compensation Based on Percentage and Estimated Value</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Private land purchased or acquired by enemy and puppet regimes in various occupied areas may be repurchased by the original landowners after the victory, unless the government has a definite need to use it legally. The method of repurchase is in accordance with Article 6 of the Regulations for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas, where the owners present valid documents to reclaim the land by paying back the price received at the time of collection based on the current price index. Later, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau requested and was approved by the central government to not calculate based on the price index, but to reclaim the land based on the gold price ratio. Recently, the central government has made another revision to this. The municipal government has received instructions from the Executive Yuan that when the land acquired by the enemy is approved to be reclaimed by the original owner, it should be re-estimated at the market price, that is, the percentage of the value of the property occupied by the price received by the owner at that time should be calculated, and then the amount payable should be calculated based on the estimated value of the property at the present time, using the occupied percentage. For example, if a plot of land was valued at 200,000 yuan at the time, and the enemy only paid 50,000 yuan for the purchase, accounting for 25 percent. If the land is now valued at 200 million yuan, the landowner should pay 50 million yuan, calculated at 25 percent, in order to reclaim the land.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation - Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>(1) Analysis of Family Property</p>
<p>Su Xingwu asks: A certain gentleman passed away in the 6th year of the Republic of China, leaving behind his wife and three children, A, B, and C. Later, the eldest son, A, married Bing and had a son. Two years later, A and his son passed away one after another. Since A's death, there has been discord between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Bing, knowing that it is difficult to stay for long, proposes to request an analysis of the family property. However, Bing is a weak woman and does not understand legal procedures, so please give your lawyer instructions, which would be most fortunate.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] Upon investigation, the deceased passed away before the implementation of the inheritance section of the current Civil Code. According to the old law, a widow who maintains her chastity, in addition to enjoying her own property, has no right of inheritance to her husband's estate, let alone the right to inherit the estate on behalf of her husband or his deceased son.</p>
<p>(2) Disturbing the Peace</p>
<p>Ge Shouyu asks: A friend of mine runs a rice mill with a 24-horsepower engine. It starts work every morning at 9:00 AM and stops at 6:00 PM in the evening. The machine vibrates slightly when it is running. After several reforms, it has been greatly improved. There are several legal questions, please answer: (1) If a neighbor believes that my friend is disturbing the peace, is my friend guilty? (2) Does my friend have an obligation to provide housing insurance for the neighbor? (3) If a neighbor prevents a friend from working, and my friend ignores it, is it illegal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) If the area is not restricted from setting up factories and the engine vibration is minimal during daytime work, there is no criminal offense. (2) There is no obligation to provide insurance, but if the vibration of the engine causes damage to the neighbor's house, then he is liable for compensation. (3) It is not illegal.</p>

<h3>The National Central Library Actively Handles International Exchange of Publications</h3>
<p>International Cultural Exchanges Have Become Increasingly Prosperous in the Past Six Months, Opening Up a Hub for East Asia to Communicate with International Culture</p>
<p>To communicate international academics and establish cultural construction, the mutual exchange of publications between countries is an urgent task. Since the Executive Yuan approved the National Central Library's Regulations on Handling International Exchange of Publications on January 29, 1936, and the Executive Yuan circulated it for implementation on April 19 of the same year, the work of exchanging publications has gradually unfolded, and international cultural exchanges have become increasingly prosperous. The work situation in the first half of 1936 is summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Import and Distribution of Foreign Publications: All agencies representing foreign governments in handling the exchange of publications have submitted applications to restore exchange relations, totaling 63 units. Among them, 26 countries, including Belgium, the United States, Italy, Portugal, and China, formally participated in the 1886 Brussels Exchange Convention. 23 countries, including Mexico, Cuba, and Russia, informally participated in the above-mentioned exchange convention. Other countries that have not participated in the above-mentioned exchange convention, such as the United Kingdom and Denmark, have also been contacted to establish exchange relations in order to universally remove international cultural barriers. A total of 206 boxes and 55 packages of books were received from the exchange offices of the United States, Denmark, West Germany, and Sweden in the first half of the year. Except for the 23 boxes recently arrived from the United States, the rest were transported or mailed according to the documents from the exchange offices and the addresses of the receiving agencies or recipients (totaling 328 units) listed on the packages. As of the end of June, a total of 133 boxes were transported in full, and 1,601 packages were collected and mailed by piece. 505 packages still need to be sorted and mailed. In addition, a large number of books sent to our country by exchange offices in Brazil, Switzerland, South Australia, the Netherlands, and Egypt are reported to be in transit.</p>
<p>(2) Collection and Distribution of Domestic Publications: All government agencies and academic groups at all levels in China have been contacted to send publications, and 5,000 copies of the exchange regulations approved by the Executive Yuan have been printed and distributed to various agencies, schools, and social groups for reference. Although some have not been able to send books and periodicals in a timely manner due to the unfinished restoration or financial difficulties, a total of 132 types and 3,288 volumes of books legally sent were still received in the first half of the year, totaling 588 types and 7,151 volumes including special books. 369 types and 1,259 copies of legally sent regular publications were received. Government agencies accounted for 299 units that sent the above publications, and educational, cultural, and academic groups accounted for 101 units. Geographically, the number of agencies in remote provinces that sent publications was only one-fifth of the total. After the publications arrive and are registered, they are sorted and shelved according to the exchange units of various countries and the nature of our country's publications they need. In addition to packages being mailed to various countries on time, those that need to be shipped abroad are done at least once every two months. As of the end of June, a total of 30 boxes of publications were transported abroad (including 8 boxes that are being negotiated with the Customs and the Central Bank). 727 packages were mailed abroad. By country, 24 boxes were shipped to the United States, 3 boxes to the United Kingdom, 1 box to Australia, and 2 boxes to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(3) Development of Exchange Work: (1) Special application matters from domestic and foreign government agencies and academic groups are handled separately. Domestically, the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Historical Materials Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank have all negotiated with relevant foreign agencies through the exchange office to exchange books and periodicals of the same nature. There are more letters from abroad requesting. The important ones include the US State Department requesting donations of Chinese government reports, statistics, and publications such as university journals and research reports, and donating the full set from the Victory Fukan issue. Part of it has been handed over to the US Academic Office for air transportation to Washington, DC. As a result, two sets of Chinese official books will be collected in the United States (the other set is collected by the US Library of Congress). The Central Bureau of Statistics of Batavia requested donations of books and periodicals related to statistics and socioeconomics. The Ferenc Hopp Museum of Eastern Asiatic Arts in Hungary suffered heavy damage in this war, and specially sent a letter requesting donations of Chinese art magazines, art dictionaries, art history, as well as Anyang excavation reports and Anyang cultural relic catalogs, all of which are handled separately. (2) Establish exchange relationships with famous university libraries abroad, such as Columbia University, Harvard Yenching Institute, University of Hawaii, and San Marcos University in Peru, all of which have begun to exchange books and periodicals with the Chinese Exchange Office. In addition, a copy of the Siku Zhenben was donated to the University of Western Australia, and the Collection of Late Qing Poetry and the Pingjin Museum Series were purchased and donated to the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Recently, a letter was received from Professor Stephen Gáll, who learned that the Chinese College of the University of Budapest was destroyed in this war. For the sake of restoration, China should provide assistance.</p>
<p>(4) Translation and Compilation of New Book Catalogs and Book Abstracts: (1) In order to make it convenient for foreign academic institutions and individual scholars to understand the Chinese publication situation and select and purchase or exchange Chinese books, a new book catalog has been translated and compiled, which is divided into two parts: books and periodicals. After the translated names, English annotations, publication year, publication place, publisher, price, etc. are attached, and published quarterly in the English journal "Book Forest Quarterly" published by the National Central Library. The publication of this journal for less than a year has made a great contribution to international academic circles. In addition to sending letters requesting exchanges and subscriptions, Professor Stephen Gáll specially reported to the Hungarian News and Hungarian Radio to promote it. (2) Chinese publications are often inconvenient for foreign scholars due to the difficulty of the text. The Birmingham Public Library, the Oxford University Library, the Oxford University Botanical Garden Library, and the Royal Entomological Society of London have all requested that a copy of the English abstract be attached when sending publications to make it easier to understand.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the National Central Library's International Exchange Office for Publications represents the government in handling the exchange of publications and will become one of the hubs for East Asia to communicate with international culture. However, due to insufficient funding, it has not been able to fully develop.</p>

<h3>To Prevent Arbitrage and Capital Flight: The National Bank Tightens Remittances to South China: Commercial Banks Limited to 50 Million Per Week: The Bank of China Also Stops Ordinary Commercial Remittances</h3>
<p>Due to smuggling, the exchange rate in South China has risen sharply, causing severe fluctuations. Under the control of the Central Bank, the exchange rate has been effectively stabilized, but the situation in South China is still special, and the rise in the domestic exchange rate has become even more severe recently. The exchange rate for commercial banks once exceeded 5 per thousand, reaching a peak of 280 yuan. The exchange rate in Guangzhou and other places has already been raised by national banks to a record of 95 yuan and cannot be increased any further. The biggest reason for this exchange rate fluctuation is still smuggling and capital flight to Hong Kong. Because the official exchange rate differs too much from the exchange rate for commercial banks, an arbitrage phenomenon has occurred. For example, if 10 million yuan is remitted from a national bank to South China, a profit of 1 million yuan can be made. In view of this, the Central Bank has stipulated starting yesterday (30th) that the amount of money remitted by each commercial bank to the provinces of Guangzhou and Fujian is limited to 50 million per week. Remittances can be made in installments or in one lump sum, but any amount exceeding 50 million will be rejected. At the same time, national banks are also tightening commercial remittances. The Bank of China has stopped ordinary commercial remittances yesterday (30th), limiting remittances for living expenses to a maximum of 2 million yuan. These measures by the national banks are all to prevent capital flight and arbitrage by unscrupulous merchants. When the situation improves, the normal practices will be restored.</p>
<p>In addition, the exchange rates for remittances from national banks to various regions have been revised. The rate for the Guangdong area is all 95 yuan. The rate for Xiamen in the Fujian area has been increased from 80 yuan to 95 yuan, and the rate for Fuzhou has been increased from 50 yuan to 80 yuan. The rate for the Guangxi area has been increased from 60 yuan to 80 yuan. The rate for Changsha and Hengyang in the Hunan area has been increased from 40 yuan to 45 yuan. The rate for Lianyungang, Xinpu, and Dongtai in the Jiangsu area has been increased from 20 yuan to 25 yuan. The rate for Hankou and Wuchang in the Hubei area has been increased from 35 yuan to 40 yuan. The rate for Shashi, Yichang, and other places has been increased from 40 yuan to 45 yuan per thousand. The rate for Qingdao in the Shandong area has been increased from 5 yuan to 20 yuan, and the rate for other places has been increased from 5 yuan to 10 yuan. The rate for other places has been decreased from 30 yuan to 20 yuan. The rate for the Shaanxi area has been decreased from 10 yuan to 5 yuan. All other rates remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Ministry Approves Three Measures for Deferred Trading: The Securities Exchange Formally Announces It Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have formally approved the continuation of deferred trading on the Securities Exchange and the payment of security deposits. The approval was issued on the 28th and brought to Shanghai by Gu Shanchang, the assistant manager of the Securities Exchange who had been sent to Nanjing for instructions. The Securities Exchange also announced the three measures approved by the Ministry yesterday: (1) Deferred trading will continue on a trial basis for three months. (2) The security deposit for deferred trading will be 50% of the transaction amount in cash. (3) 70% of the total security deposit should be deposited in the Central Bank. The above measures will take effect on July 1st.</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange held a meeting of the Standing Council at 10:00 AM yesterday. All members of the Standing Council attended on time, except for Wang Zhixin, who was absent due to a trip to Taiwan. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Du Yong. In addition to the report on the recent business situation by the Business Department, the new approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs regarding deferred trading was also reported. The meeting ended at 10:45 AM. The Securities Exchange immediately posted the three new approval measures in the market for public announcement.</p>
<p>Brokers Express Disappointment</p>
<p>Yesterday, brokers at the Securities Exchange expressed disappointment with the new approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, believing that the new measures for deferred trading will reduce normal trading and hinder the development of legitimate brokers' businesses. The black market and off-exchange trading will become more active. However, general observers believe that the government has its own unavoidable difficulties in implementing this new measure. Currently, the leaders of the brokers are exchanging opinions, hoping to request the government to reconsider through legal means.</p>
<p>Four Types of Stocks Approved for Listing (Report from this newspaper) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved four types of stocks for listing on the 28th: (1) Zhabei Water and Electricity, (2) Huaxin Cement, (3) Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, and (4) Hengfeng Yarn Factory. The above stocks can be listed for trading once the listing procedures have been completed with the Securities Exchange.</p>
<p>Yongan Yarn Factory Has Some Off-Exchange Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the holiday, trading inside the Shanghai stock exchange stopped, and only settlement was done. In the off-exchange black market, there were some transactions in Yongan Yarn Factory stocks, all at the current day's cash price. Initially, the price was 9,120 yuan, but later, due to tight credit conditions, sellers were eager to sell for cash, and the price was traded at 8,800 yuan around 12:00. Afterwards, there were no ten households interested. Even the market announced that settlement would be extended to the end of September. The crowd believed that such negative news had passed, and buyers switched to stocks. It was expected that the price would rebound, and the final price was 8,950 yuan. Red yarn was traded at around 9,500 yuan. There was no market for other stocks. The unified public price for Class C was called at over 8,200, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Off-Exchange Shanghai Stocks</p>
<p>Dasheng First Factory 7.4 million 7.5 million</p>
<p>Zhonghua Baoju 62,000 There were transactions</p>
<p>Huashang Electric 41,000 There were transactions</p>
<h3>The Committee of Discounted Loans Passes Public Loans of 7.3 Billion</h3>
<p>The National Bank Discount Loan Committee held its 14th meeting at 4:00 PM on the 30th. Qin Runqing, Chen Duoru, Lu Chen, Shen Rixin, Lin Chongyong, and more than ten other people attended. The meeting was chaired by Qin Runqing and approved 35 industrial loan cases and 2 export material loan cases, for a total of 37 cases, with an approved amount of 7.36 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Transactions Are Slow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton transactions were slow, and the market was very quiet. After yarn factories resumed negotiating cotton yarn prices, costs were greatly restricted, and the absorption of cotton was minimal. Sellers, in view of the small amount of spot cotton remaining, were unwilling to sell. At the same time, due to the June end interest settlement, payments could not be immediately used, so there were very few transactions. In the afternoon, the opening price for Hankou fine cotton was 1.84 million, Lingbao was 1.95 million to 2.05 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 265,000 to 285,000 per dan. Only Lingbao had some factory delivery transactions, with a price of 2.12 million.</p>
<h3>Tea Transactions Are Not Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm tea market: Due to the eve of the June end settlement of silver and money, credit on the market almost came to a standstill, so the Wuchang Tea Company still signed deals. It continued to absorb last year's famous Tunchi Dabang and Pingshui Dabang teas, and the rest remained in a wait-and-see attitude. In terms of prices, although sellers tried to push prices up, it was ultimately difficult to advance under these circumstances, and the results were mostly similar to last week.</p>
<p>Domestic sales of red and green tea in this street's shops and Suzhou gangs remained unabated, and the situation hovered as before. It is reported that the previously quiet Shangbai chrysanthemum suddenly revived due to the Guangdong gang's acceptance, and transactions suddenly opened up. Opening prices were also extremely profitable, reportedly reaching 3 million yuan per dan.</p>
<p>[Another report] The first batch of new Wenzhou red boxed tea this year was transported by Anhe Company's Ankang yesterday with 286 boxes, which were sold by Quantai Tea Company. Samples are currently being distributed.</p>
<h3>Soliciting One Million Citizens to Subscribe to US Treasury Bonds; Solicitation Committee Drafting Measures</h3>
<p>The US Dollar Bond Solicitation Committee held its third committee meeting yesterday at 4:00 PM, presided over by Qian Xinzhai, in the conference room on the third floor of the National Bank. Present were Du Yuesheng, Xu Qiguang, Song Hanwei, Shen Rixin, Qin Runqing, Li Shuming, Song Hongyuan, Pan Shihao, Hong Nianxing, Liu Jingzhuang, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Chen, Deputy Governor of the National Bank.</p>
<p>The meeting approved the principle of "Launching a Patriotic Movement to Solicit One Million Citizens to Subscribe to Short-Term Treasury Bonds." Detailed measures are being drafted, with the aim of starting no later than the 15th of this month and ending before the end of September. The primary subscribers will be citizens, particularly members of various social groups. The procedure will involve the association submitting the approved forms to various social groups, exchanging them for treasury bond subscription vouchers, thus eliminating the previous hassle of individual representatives engaging in buying and selling.</p>
<p>It was also learned that each person who subscribes to US$10 in bonds will receive an honorary certificate from the committee as a memento. Social groups and individuals who promote and subscribe the most will be rewarded separately by the Ministry of Finance. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. After the meeting, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, stated that the economic conditions for our treasury bonds are quite favorable, and he hoped everyone would purchase them promptly and not miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday, being the end of the month, bond sales were unusually active, with public bonds totaling US$155,050 and treasury bonds totaling US$824,180, breaking records.</p>
<h3>Simplified Import Procedures to be Implemented on the 16th of This Month</h3>
<p>To facilitate import merchants, the Import Management Committee has decided to simplify application procedures and formulate new simplified measures. It is understood that these new measures will be officially implemented on July 16. The committee will conduct a two-stage review for applications in Categories 1, 2, and 3 of the appendix. In the first stage, applicants fill out the application form and submit it to the committee for review, then request the issuance of a permit. As this procedure is cumbersome, it often delays the process. It is reported that under the new measures, the committee will review and issue both the application and the permit in one go, but all will be handled through designated banks. Applications submitted before the 15th will still be processed according to the old procedures. Applications submitted on the 16th will be reviewed according to the new procedures. The committee is currently printing the various forms.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Are Lackluster; Medium and Lower Grades of White Japonica Rice Continue to Fall; Mainland Wheat Prices Decline and Flour Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets collectively received over 7,200 piculs of rice. Sales in the South market were lackluster. High-grade Japonica rice was still considered average, but medium and lower grades continued to fall by 3000-5000 yuan. Indica rice was dull and fell by 10,000 yuan, while white round rice also fell by 10,000 yuan. The North market remained relatively stable with little fluctuation.</p>
<p>Flour sales weakened, mainland wheat prices fell, and both foreign and factory flour saw a decline of 1000-2000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour fell by 3000-4000 yuan. Dull sales have turned price increases into declines. Bran is scarce and firm, rising by 1000 yuan. Soybean cake sales are scattered and not strong, sellers remain firm, and prices continued to rise by 1000-2000 yuan. Yingkou cake remains unchanged. Yellow soybeans see average sales and a slight increase of 2000-3000 yuan. Black soybeans see active sales in Nanyang, with a sharp increase in prices and a particularly aggressive rise, with high grades skyrocketing by 30,000-40,000 yuan, bringing the average price up by 10,000 yuan, exceeding the 300,000 mark. Red beans are being purchased in South China, and popsicle sales in the city are still brisk, leading to a new high price, breaking the 300,000 mark, skyrocketing by 30,000-40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Kidney beans see movement in Shantou, rising by 4000-5000 yuan. Wheat arrivals are not abundant, gradually increasing by 4000-5000 yuan. Sesame is in short supply, with many inquiries, and the situation is tight. Raw peanuts are being heavily purchased by Guangdong merchants, and local shops are following suit, gradually increasing prices, adding another 10,000 yuan. Sorghum is firm, and there are slight inquiries about corn from the North, continuing to rise by 3000-5000 yuan.</p>
<p>It is heard that merchants from South China are still continuing to purchase oil, and local shops have strengthened their intake due to the two-day closure, with prices reaching new highs, skyrocketing by 50,000-60,000 yuan. The next two days are the bank's settlement period, and the market will be closed for two days.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] 5,000 bags of flour from the China Trust Bureau were loaded onto the China Merchants Bureau's Hainan轮 (Lún) yesterday and transported to Tianjin. Recently, the amount of commercial goods transported from Shanghai to Tianjin has gradually decreased, presumably due to the situation in North China.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Prices Are Firm and Strong</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market has recently seen rising prices in Hong Kong, resulting in fewer shipments arriving in Shanghai. Local factory goods are priced higher than current goods, and the overall price increase has kept woolen fabrics consistently strong. Both buyers and sellers see a bright future. As for sales, there are few domestic customers.</p>
<h3>After New Yarn Prices Are Agreed Upon, Textile Construction Begins Preparing for Yarn Allocation; 20,000 Pieces Are Scheduled to Be Allocated in the First Half of July</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] After the Textile Adjustment Committee announced the implementation of the joint allocation system yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company immediately began handling yarn allocation procedures, allocating yarn at the new price. (See the business news column below for the allocated price of each type of yarn). Payment procedures remain the same as originally stipulated by the Textile Construction Company. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company hung a sign, renaming itself the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee Joint Yarn Allocation. Yesterday, a total of 307 applications were received from various replicating industries, and 530 pieces of various types of yarn were approved for allocation. Although the Textile Adjustment Committee claimed that it had received over 1,000 pieces of yarn from various private factories yesterday, the Textile Construction Company had not yet received any opening yarn orders. Therefore, all the yarn allocated yesterday was still sold by the Textile Construction Company.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Textile Adjustment Committee's joint allocation system has tentatively set the total amount of yarn to be allocated in the first half of July at 20,000 pieces, with state-owned and private yarn factories each accounting for half. According to the joint allocation system regulations announced by the Textile Adjustment Committee, all yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories should be uniformly managed by the Textile Adjustment Committee for joint pricing and joint allocation. However, private factories hope for joint pricing and individual allocation. Private factories are still attached to their existing customer base. If yarn production is uniformly managed for joint allocation, it will inevitably affect the business freedom of private factories. The Textile Adjustment Committee and private factories are still discussing solutions on this point.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday, after the implementation of the joint allocation system: (1) All yarn sales transactions by state-owned and private yarn factories must be approved by the Textile Adjustment Committee from now on. (2) The allocation target is primarily end-users. (3) All yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories will be uniformly managed by the Textile Adjustment Committee, which will entrust the Textile Construction Company to allocate it on its behalf. It is reported that the more than 1,200 pieces of yarn previously stored by the Textile Management Committee have already been transferred to this committee for receipt. Furthermore, as of the 30th, private yarn factories had already delivered over 1,000 pieces of various types of yarn to the committee for joint allocation.</p>
<h3>Tight Coal Market</h3>
<p>In the coal market, bituminous coal sellers remain cautious, and the market remains tight. Only a few sellers, pressured by financial constraints at the end of the month, slightly sold at high prices. Anthracite prices are chaotic, especially high-grade Jiaozuo lump coal, where both supply and demand are lacking, with transaction prices in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 million yuan. Coking coal prices are rising more slowly, with more arrivals and active sales. Coal briquette factories have successively adjusted their selling prices due to rising labor and material costs, with large factories charging 660,000 yuan per ton and small factories charging 600,000 yuan. However, sales are sluggish due to the off-season. Firewood and charcoal follow the trend of the coal market, with prices rising rapidly.</p>
<h3>Flourishing Taiwanese Alkali Industry; Production Leads the Nation</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 30th) Taiwan's alkali industry is flourishing and its current production leads the nation. According to Fang Yiju, General Manager of the Taiwan Alkali Company, the company currently owns three factories in Kaohsiung, Tainan, and Anping. Its main products are caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and bleaching powder, which have a wide range of applications. Currently, the monthly production of solid caustic soda is 300 tons, hydrochloric acid is 100 tons, and bleaching powder is 200 tons. The production of other various products has also increased by more than double since the takeover period. Currently, demand for alkali is strong throughout the country, with people coming to Taiwan to purchase it. In addition to supplying local soap, paper, oil refining, and aluminum manufacturing factories, since April of this year, the company has allocated 600 tons. At a price of 300,000 Taiwan dollars per ton, this amounts to 180 million Taiwan dollars, but demand is still not being met.</p>
<p>Fang continued to say that Taiwan has abundant water, electricity, and raw materials such as lime, making it an ideal place to develop the alkali industry. The future plan is to increase production. The company has already restored 2,500 acres of salt fields, with 7,000 acres under restoration. By the end of the year, there will be 10,000 acres of salt fields available for use. It also plans to build a new factory in Kaohsiung and has ordered new-style electrical machinery and factory equipment from the United States. It is estimated that when the factory is completed, it will be able to produce 1,000 tons of solid alkali, 600 tons of hydrochloric acid, and 500 tons of bleaching powder per month.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Transporting Cotton to China; Manufacturers Can Exchange It for Cotton Yarn; One Piece of 20-Count Yarn Can Be Exchanged for 760 Pounds of Cotton</h3>
<p>As of June 18 of this year, 127,868 bales of UNRRA-allocated cotton have been transported to China. Among them, 61,484 bales have been distributed by the Executive Yuan at a price of 7.45 million national currency per picul to 32 textile factories according to the distribution quota stipulated by the former Textile Management Committee. Currently, there are still 66,384 bales of cotton in various warehouses. In order to continue distributing this cotton and avoid the increase in cotton prices affecting other commodity prices, the Executive Yuan has decided to adopt an exchange method. Manufacturers who have obtained UNRRA cotton allocation quotas can apply to the Executive Yuan to order cotton based on a ratio of 760 pounds of foreign cotton exchanged for one piece of 20-count cotton yarn weighing 400 pounds. The new method has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record-keeping. The Executive Yuan will notify manufacturers within this week to negotiate and sign contracts.</p>
<h3>Yokohama Specie Bank Declares Closure</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Tokyo, 30th) Japan's most famous Yokohama Specie Bank declared closure on the 30th. The bank was Japan's main representative in overseas finance before the war and has a history of 68 years. Since the Japanese government officially announced post-war measures to rebuild Japan's finances, the bank has actually been in a state of closure.</p>
<h3>Remittances from Overseas Chinese Sharply Decline in May; Only 10.5 Billion Yuan, a 50% Decrease Compared to April</h3>
<p>Remittances from overseas Chinese handled by the Bank of China have been steadily declining due to the large difference between the officially set foreign exchange rate and the black market rate. According to the bank's published figures for May, the total amount of remittances from the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia was only 10,536,666,731.36 yuan. This is a 50% decrease compared to the 20.7 billion yuan in April. The severity of the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Reports from various sources indicate a further significant decrease in June, possibly less than half of May. Remittances from Southeast Asia have almost disappeared and are being evaded through Hong Kong. After remittances are sent to Hong Kong, the remittance drafts are brought to Guangzhou for sale. General merchants purchase them and then send them abroad to purchase materials. This is a gradually public fact.</p>
<p>Of the remittances received in May, New York accounted for the largest share, at 7,795,419,186 yuan. Next was Havana, Cuba, at 1,008,762,870 yuan. Third was London, at 23,048,1937.37 yuan.</p>
<p>The remaining amounts were small. Sydney, Australia, accounted for 165,084,449 yuan. Calcutta, India, accounted for 124,085,836.35 yuan. Yangon accounted for 62,777,600 yuan, Singapore accounted for 5,190,000 yuan, Kuala Lumpur accounted for 1,173,600 yuan, and Penang accounted for 5,370,000 yuan. Saigon, Vietnam, accounted for 20,482,504.52 yuan, and Batavia, Dutch East Indies, accounted for 910 million yuan. Foreign agency stores accounted for 129,050,518.14 yuan. The total was 10,536,666,731.36 yuan.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Pineapple Exports Are Active; American Merchants Are Coming to Place Orders</h3>
<p>Taiwan's special product, pineapple, is again entering the summer harvest season. The planted area of pineapple in Taiwan was once over 10,000 hectares, with a harvest of 140,000 to 150,000 tons of fresh fruit. 60% of this is made into canned goods, with exports reaching a maximum of 1.6 million boxes. Before the war, its products were as famous as those from Hawaii and Singapore. However, both Hawaii and Singapore have been affected by the war, resulting in a sharp decrease in production and unmet demand. Recently, the Taiwan Pineapple Company has repeatedly received American merchants sending personnel to Taiwan to place orders. The company's canned pineapple exports are very active.</p>
<h3>Import Surcharge to Continue for Another Year</h3>
<p>According to an announcement by the Jianghai Customs authorities, the 5% surcharge on import goods based on customs duties, which was originally scheduled to stop at the end of June, has now been decided to continue for another year from today (July 1st).</p>
<p>Timber Market Stable</p>
<p>The timber market has been relatively stable recently. Foreign fir arrived yesterday, estimated at over one million feet. Fir prices are slightly soft and weak, with foreign pine priced around 8,000 yuan and fir around 3,000 yuan. If there are no unexpected movements, the market situation is likely to hover for a long time.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Deposits in Banks and Financial Institutions for the First Five Months of This Year</h3>

<h3>China Trust Bureau is in Discussions Regarding the Purchase of Stale Tea</h3>
<p>Although the authorities have repeatedly expressed their determination to handle the purchase of stale tea from 1946, there has been no follow-up to date. According to sources yesterday, the tea mortgage loans from the Central Bank introduced by the China National Agricultural Corporation for tea merchants in Shanghai expired on the 3rd of this month. However, given the widespread slump in tea prices today, merchants are unable to repay the loans. Therefore, government purchase of stale tea is imperative. It is heard that the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau and the China United Tea Corporation are currently discussing the purchase price: 720,000 yuan per picul for Keemun black tea, 660,000 yuan for Tunxi green tea, and 480,000 yuan for Ping green tea. Tea merchants claim that this price was set months ago, and prices have since risen several times, requesting a general increase of 20%.</p>

<h3>The Yuyao Salt Fields: A Visit</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou Dispatch, June 27th. Our reporter, Huang Xing Tian.</p>
<p>Like a fan spread out on the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay, a vast plain connecting the sea and sky, the soil always tinged with white, this is the largest salt supply area in southeastern China – the Yuyao Salt Fields. This area, centered on Andong, includes seven townships with a population of 100,000. Administratively, it surpasses Yuyao County, but due to the autocratic nature of salt administration over the past few centuries, salt farmers only knew the salt field director and not the county magistrate. Recently, the salt farmers' households have been registered with the county government, but the area still retains its special character. To understand the current situation of this abundant producing area of eastern Zhejiang, I, the reporter, after arriving in Yuyao, was accompanied by Secretary Zhao and others to visit the rich fields.</p>
<p>The Central Area of Andong</p>
<p>Traveling north from Yuyao by jeep for seventy *li* (approximately 35 kilometers), about forty minutes, one arrives at the center of the salt fields – Andong. Here, there is a main street, very narrow, like a typical Jiangnan market town. Besides the fixed shops, there is also a market centered on stalls. Business is thriving. Prices are higher than in Yuyao city. Because of the high cost of living, wages are also higher than elsewhere. It is said that in other towns, hiring an old woman to chant Buddhist scriptures costs only five hundred yuan per day, in addition to meals, while in the salt fields, it costs three thousand yuan.</p>
<p>According to the Yuyao Salt Field Director, Wang Ting, he told the reporter that the salt field is seventy *li* long from east to west and fifteen *li* wide from north to south. Due to the influence of changes in the currents of Hangzhou Bay, it is gradually shifting north. The Salt Field Office moved north to Andong in the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916). The total area is as large as 99,000 *mu* (approximately 6,600 hectares). Before the war, there were 730,000 salt pans (including 550,000 official pans), producing 4.8 million *dan* (approximately 240,000 metric tons) of salt annually, accounting for six-tenths of the total production of Zhejiang Province, and together with Shandong, Lianghuai, and Changlu, it was known as one of the four major salt fields. After being occupied by the enemy in April of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941), the enemy built bamboo fences to surround the salt area and control salt, causing food shortages in free Zhejiang, eastern Jiangxi, and southern Anhui. At the same time, they intensified their exploitation. At that time, the salt farmers had no rice to eat all year round and only used sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains as meals. Some salt farmers sold furniture such as beds and tables in the city, and then bought some coarse rice to cook porridge at home, which they considered the greatest luxury! The suffering of the salt farmers is evident from this. After the victory, the government復員 [restored public order], which slightly alleviated the plight of the salt farmers. According to statistics, there are currently 5,822 salt households, totaling about 60,000 people, and 21,000 salt workers. There are a total of 539,680 salt pans, which is much less than before the war. Therefore, salt production has also decreased. Last year, only 2 million *dan* were harvested, and this year it is estimated to be 2.1 million *dan*. The salt produced supplies 31 counties and one city in this province, about 700,000 *dan* annually, 600,000 *dan* to Jiangsu, about 200,000 *dan* to eastern Jiangxi, and about 120,000 *dan* to southern Anhui.</p>
<p>Salt Pans: Salt Farmers' Property</p>
<p>Because the seawater in Hangzhou Bay is relatively less salty, the salt-making methods in the Yuyao Salt Fields are different from those in Lianghuai and Shandong. They use the alkaline properties in the soil to make brine, and then dry it in the sun, so the cost is much higher than directly drying salt from seawater. The land in the salt fields is said to be public, but in reality, there is private ownership. These landowners consider the number of salt pans to be their property. Salt farmers rent land to make salt, and the rental price is also calculated based on the number of salt pans. The usual rent for a salt pan is seventy to one hundred *jin* (approximately 35 to 50 kilograms) of salt per year. This is the same as landlords collecting rent in grain. Therefore, the status of salt farmers is the same as that of tenant farmers in ordinary villages. And the vast majority of farmers are tenant farmers who rent salt pans to dry salt. After renting the salt pans, the salt farmers "rely on the heavens" and use the processes of "scooping, leaching, spreading, and drying" to make snow-white salt to exchange for yellow and white grains of rice. Their simple equipment consists of a pile of earth built in a corner of the white land (i.e., salt land), with a round pit dug on top and lined with straw, called a "leach bowl." The bottom of this bowl is connected to a bamboo pipe that leads to a wooden bucket buried in the mud nearby. When making salt, one must first scoop up the soil containing salt, then gather it and pour it into the leaching bowl, then fill it with seawater. After one or two hours, the salt in the soil mixes with the seawater and becomes brine, which is then poured into the bucket through the bamboo pipe. The quality of the brine (i.e., the concentration of alkalinity) is measured using a bamboo spoon with three to five *mukouzi* [wood lotus seeds] at the bottom, similar to the ones used in ordinary wine shops or oil shops to measure wine or oil, but cruder. When this spoon is filled with brine, if all the wood lotus seeds float, then it is the best. Then, the brine is transported to the drying field and poured onto the salt pans to evaporate the water. The salt pans are rectangular, about six or seven *chi* (approximately 2 to 2.3 meters) long and about three *chi* (approximately 1 meter) wide, with wooden strips about two *cun* (approximately 6.7 centimeters) high nailed around the edges to prevent the water from flowing out. If the sun is strong, after three or four hours, one can see a patch of snow-white salt on the salt pan.</p>
<p>10,000 *Dan* of Salt Produced Daily</p>
<p>Salt farmers "rely on the heavens" because their production depends entirely on nature and the weather. In spring and winter (approximately from December to May or June of the following year), the soil in the salt fields is mostly wet, and not much salt is absorbed; moreover, the sunshine is also relatively weak, and the time for water evaporation increases, so production is sharply reduced. This period is called the off-season by salt farmers. After June, it is the peak season. In summer and autumn, the white land is drier and easier to absorb salt; and the sunshine is strong, making drying easier, and production increases greatly. When the reporter visited, it could produce 10,000 *dan* per day. But it has not yet reached its peak. The hotter the weather, the more the production. On average, a salt pan can produce 300 *jin* per year. The reporter interviewed a salt farmer with a family of six, who rented sixty salt pans and could obtain 18,000 *jin* of salt per year. With a rent of 70 *jin* per pan, they had to pay 4,200 *jin*. The remaining, calculated at the current price of 29,000 yuan per *dan*, could earn 4.02 million yuan. After deducting 2.5% for welfare donations (about 100,000 yuan), they had an average of about 300,000 yuan per month, which was barely enough to eat and live on. But if they needed to repair or replace salt-making equipment, they would have to switch to eating some miscellaneous grains. As for the landlords in the salt fields, they are very comfortable, like those in the countryside. They do not have to make salt and rarely live in the salt fields. They live in the city all year round, relying on collecting salt rent. It is said that the largest landlord owns more than 10,000 salt pans. If calculated at the lower rent of 70 *jin* per pan, he can collect 700,000 *jin* of salt per year, which means he can earn more than 20 billion yuan in huge profits (at the current price). Isn't it easier to make money than other large enterprises? All he has to do is own some salt pans, and even the production tools are provided by the salt farmers themselves.</p>
<p>Production Greatly Restricted</p>
<p>So, why not make more salt pans? This is already one of the important disputes between the salt farmers and the Salt Field Office today. Since the War of Resistance, the Yuyao Salt Fields have lost 170,000 salt pans, and production has fallen to half of what it was before the war! And the salt farmers have plenty of extra labor to engage in salt production, so why doesn't the Salt Field Office allow them to increase the number of salt pans? According to Director Wang, it is to avoid overproduction. If production is too high, it cannot be transported and sold. The total salt production in the country can reach 44 million *dan*, but only 34 million *dan* can be sold. The cost of salt production in Yuyao is relatively high, and fortunately, 1 million *dan* have already been overstocked. But we are also not satisfied with this explanation, because brine is of extreme importance in industrial and national defense materials. Although China's industry is backward, a large amount of salt is needed for dyeing plants for sizing, for soap factories for liquid separation, for ice-making factories to reduce the temperature, for making tanned leather, for making dry batteries, etc. Before the war, 4.8 million *dan* were produced annually, but this year only 2.1 million *dan* can be produced. Why restrict production? Now, the process from salt production to consumption, although it has changed from "produced by the people, collected by the government, transported by the government, and sold by the government" to "produced by the people, collected by the government, transported by merchants (or entrusted to merchants by the government), and sold by merchants," perhaps it would be more helpful to salt production and the lives of salt farmers if the state monopoly was abandoned and it was changed to a state of free sales.</p>
<p>Petition for 1000 Salt per Stone of Rice</p>
<p>Not long ago, salt farmers petitioned the province and went to the capital, demanding a salt price of "one thousand salt for rice" (exchanging one thousand *jin* of salt for one hundred and fifty *jin* of rice). This issue has not been fully resolved to this day. In the early days of復員 [restoring public order], the price of salt was 200 yuan per *dan*, but by the end of last year, it had reached 4,000 yuan. After the petition, it was agreed in principle, and the price was negotiated by the salt farmers and the labor union and then approved by the Salt Field Office every month. The current price is 29,000 yuan per *dan*, while the price of rice is only 230,000 to 40,000 yuan, so it has exceeded the request. A salt woman who works like a man, pointing to the hot rice in the pot, told the reporter in a very satisfied and happy voice, "Now we can eat rice for three meals a day." I looked at it. Although it was yellow coarse rice, and it was very simple side dishes, she was so happy and grateful. The demands of the salt farmers were originally very low and very reasonable. However, the satisfaction with the current situation is temporary, and it may change with changes in prices. Director Wang said: "According to government orders, salt must be controlled by the government, and salt farmers must hand over the salt they produce to the government warehouse, and the government will grant them 'production loans.' The current production loans are issued at the full market price; but during the peak production season, due to insufficient loans, only a few parts of it will be paid first. He also advocated that the salt price should be raised to 'one thousand salt for a stone of rice' during the off-season, because salt farmers produce less; but during the peak production season, when production is sufficient, it should be reduced to 'one thousand salt for one hundred *jin* of rice.'" But according to Han Shizhou, the secretary of the Salt Industry Labor Union, "In fact, the prosperity of salt production and sales is the opposite. The off-season is the peak sales season, and the peak production season is the off-sales season. Therefore, the pricing standard of the Salt Field Office is unreasonable. Moreover, the salt farmers do not know about production loans, but only know about salt funds. They take the salt to sell to the government, and they have to recover the salt funds and go home to buy rice to eat. Therefore, if the office wants to withhold salt funds, it is unreasonable and unjustifiable to the salt farmers." Therefore, the salt price issue is lurking with waves. Now, the police and the people just hope that the Salt Field Office will abolish the pricing policy to avoid being restricted by price fluctuations and being forced to eat sweet potato soup again without rice to eat.</p>
<p>Pengl Chief Changed to Warehouse Chief</p>
<p>The salt affairs administrative structure is also worth our attention. In the era of the *pengl* chief system, the economic affairs of the salt farmers were entirely in the hands of the *pengl* chief. When the salt farmers carried the salt to hand over, even if it was clearly 100 *jin*, he would weigh it and say it was only 80 *jin*, and it would be 80 *jin*. If he wanted to say that the salt was black, the salt farmers had no way to argue. When paying the salt funds (that is, issuing production loans), he would deduct the funds and only issue a few parts, or even delay payment; and he would take the money to do business himself or resell it to lend to the salt farmers at high interest rates, taking the salt farmers' hard-earned money to exploit them. The suffering of the salt farmers can be imagined. However, the salt farmers are kind. Nine-tenths of them are Shaoxing people, and one-tenth are local Yuyao people. For hundreds of years, they have been bearing the burden of life and struggling to continue their lives. Until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), the accumulated heavy pressure erupted in their intolerable anger, resulting in salt police firing, killing and injuring hundreds of people. After the victory, through the efforts of the salt farmers and the industry labor union, the Salt Affairs Office finally improved a lot. They abandoned the *pengl* chief and changed it to warehouse chief. The salt farmers have reportedly requested the implementation of democratic "warehouse chief elections" and would be satisfied if they could only have their own representatives to supervise.</p>
<p>Building Seven Dikes for Reclamation</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the sea tides, the salt land in Yuyao gradually expanded north. Therefore, after a certain period, the original white land, because it was further away from the sea, the salt production was sharply reduced, so it was necessary to build dikes for reclamation and plant cotton or other suitable plants. After about a hundred years, a dike must be built. Now, seven dikes have been built. The reporter drove north from Yuyao, passing through the first, second, and new dikes. Between the dikes, rice is planted, or cotton and wheat are planted. There is no trace of the salt fields. The changes of the sea are great. Thatched houses and earthen graves stand side by side. One cannot help but sigh at the impermanence of life. The seventh dike started construction last December. It is 15 kilometers long, involves 320,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and is 85% complete. It is expected to be completed by the end of June. After the dike is completed, salt cannot be produced inside the dike in one or two years, so how to desalinate the soil is the urgent task of the salt farmers. However, after the Salt Field Office built the dike, it has been slow to open the holes, and the water cannot get out, so the salinity cannot be removed, and planting is impossible. The 25,000 *mu* of land inside the dike will not benefit from it and will suffer from it. Therefore, when the salt farmers talked to the reporter about the dike issue, they were all filled with sorrow. Once this 25,000 *mu* of white land really cannot produce salt or grow cotton, how will the salt farmers make a living? I hope that the salt affairs authorities can seek the current and future welfare of the salt farmers in every way, and don't push them away!</p>

<h3>Crimson Blood in the Central Plains</h3>
<p>— Special dispatch from Kaifeng, 24th. Xu Jin</p>
<p>The Central Plains are the fertile land of Chinese culture, but now they have become a battlefield. Not only is it difficult to find the breath of culture, but even some natural landscapes have been shattered and changed by the shock of artillery fire. We don't need to talk about anything too distant. Ever since the enemy invaded Henan by railway in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China (1938), the common people have not had a single day of peace. The Yellow River washed away most of eastern Henan, and the figures for people's lives and property are still difficult to count. The drought in the thirty-first year of the Republic of China (1942) created a terrifying situation in southern Puyang. Roots, bark, grass, salted earth, all became the main food of the people, and even some more tragic and bizarre things happened that those who had not experienced the situation personally could not believe. When the Central Plains fell to the enemy in the thirty-third year of the Republic of China (1944), almost no part of Henan was free of the enemy, and the common people lived in deep water and hot fire, but they had no complaints. Their only hope was to drive the Japanese devils out so they could live a peaceful life.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Communists closed the door to peace talks, Henan has fallen into a new round of war. How can the people who have suffered so much bear such torment? The government has the responsibility to protect the country and the people and cannot ignore their life and death. Therefore, sharp conflicts have occurred between the local government and the Communist army, and all kinds of tragic events have been staged. On the night of January 31, more than 10,000 troops under Liu Bocheng sneaked from Zhecheng to Luyi. At that time, the team guarding the city had only a little over a thousand people. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Sun Jingxuan immediately deployed defenses inside the city and was determined to coexist with the city. At first, only scattered gunshots could be heard, but later they became more and more dense, and the sound became deafening. The artillery fire flew through the air, appearing even brighter under the starlight.</p>
<p>One night passed. The next morning, the Communist bandits' artillery fire became even more intense, but our army continued to fight back, and the Communist bandits' corpses were strewn across the city. While the two sides were fighting fiercely, an unfortunate thing happened at this time. The troops guarding the Dawang Temple suddenly all defected, and the West Gate was lost. After noon, the Communist bandits concentrated their artillery fire on the West Gate. Under the fierce artillery fire, the West Gate was completely destroyed, and the Communist army poured into the city, engaging in street fighting with the defending troops. The two sides fought repeatedly in hand-to-hand combat for two hours. In the end, due to the disparity in numbers, the defending troops were defeated, and County Magistrate Sun was captured after running out of ammunition and reinforcements. Also captured were Ji Shoupeng, the leader of the Second District Training Team, and Wang Yingtang, the head of the county self-defense force. From then on, County Magistrate Sun began a hunger strike and refused to talk to the Communist bandits. To vent their anger, the Communist bandits took County Magistrate Sun to Shuanglouji in the southwest of the city and killed him. It is said that County Magistrate Sun was from Shangqiu and was 39 years old. He studied at Peking University and served as the commander of the East Henan Guerrilla, the commander of the Anti-Enemy Self-Defense, brigade commander, and deputy division commander during the War of Resistance. After the victory, he became the magistrate of Luyi County.</p>
<p>Zhecheng County in eastern Henan is also a county frequently harassed by the Communist bandits. When County Magistrate Lu Chuanzhi was the magistrate of Minquan County, the Communist bandits besieged the county seat. County Magistrate Lu fought hard against the Communist bandits with a small number of national troops for sixteen days and nights and finally repelled the Communist bandits, thus creating a brilliant record in eastern Henan. On March 6, more than a thousand troops under Jin Shaoshan suddenly attacked the suburbs of the city, and a fierce battle broke out. However, our side had not yet been fully replenished after the new setback and was attacked again, which felt really unsustainable. After a bitter fight, they broke through and reached Lingziyang (northeast of the city) to reorganize and deploy. However, County Magistrate Lu, filled with anger, was difficult to suppress, so he led his team back into the county seat that night and fought with the bandits all night, killing and wounding many of the Communist bandits. In order to reduce casualties, County Magistrate Lu broke through again and moved to Yanzhuang in the northeast of the city, preparing to wait for an opportunity to counterattack. Unexpectedly, before he could catch his breath, the Communist bandits chased him and surrounded Yanzhuang. County Magistrate Lu led the remnants of his troops to resist, and finally died heroically after running out of ammunition and reinforcements.</p>
<p>Another unfortunate thing happened in Sui County. On March 8, news was received that the Communist bandits were attacking the city. The Communist bandits who came to attack were troops under Jin Shaoshan and Wang Qimei, totaling about 5,000 people, while the defending troops only had the Sixth Column of the Provincial Security and the County Self-Defense Force. The disparity in strength was very large. At about 7 p.m., the entire city was surrounded by the Communist army. That night, they launched seven fierce attacks on the county seat in a row. Thanks to County Magistrate Yin and Commander Yang personally supervising the defense, they were not successful. On the morning of the 10th, the artillery fire became more intense because it was already daylight and the targets were obvious. The fortifications inside the city were destroyed by the bandits' artillery fire, and most of the officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and the ammunition was about to run out. Just at this moment, the Communist army took the opportunity to enter the city, and the team engaged in bayonet fighting with the Communist army. At this time, the intensity of the fighting can be said to have reached its peak. Our garden team was almost completely killed or wounded, and the county seat fell. In the chaotic situation, County Magistrate Yin and Commander Yang were both captured.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits also knew that County Magistrate Yin was a capable person, so they tried every means to lure him to join them, but they did not know County Magistrate Yin's firm and unyielding spirit. Although they tried to induce him repeatedly, he refused with harsh words and was unmoved. Later, thousands of people asked the Communist army to release County Magistrate Yin. They knew that it was difficult to achieve their goal, so on March 16, they sent County Magistrate Yin to the headquarters of the First Military Sub-district of the traitorous bandits and advised him to donate money and land to comfort the families of the traitorous bandits who had died, but County Magistrate Yin still refused to accept it and asked to die quickly, so he was killed. County Magistrate Yin was very loved by the people in Sui County, and now the elders of Sui County still remember him with tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>The most painful thing was the death of Hu, the magistrate of Ningling County. The incident occurred at 1 a.m. on April 3, when the Communist bandits attacked the city with five regiments. The first sound was heard in the southwest of the city. In an instant, the sound of guns around the city became a chorus. County Magistrate Hu was able to remain calm, calmly directing the battle on the one hand and deeply studying countermeasures on the other. However, the armed forces defending the city had only one battalion of the National Army and two self-defense companies, totaling only 500 people, which was indeed an arduous task. The battle cry outside the city became more and more urgent, and County Magistrate Hu personally braved artillery fire to direct the battle, and the morale was extremely high. After a fierce battle all night, countless bandits were killed, but due to the exhaustion of ammunition and reinforcements, they also gradually turned to decline. At dawn on the 4th, the situation became more serious, and the gunfire was more intense than before. Many strongholds in the city were occupied by the bandits, and the wounded officers and soldiers were carried down one after another, and the entire city was shrouded in artillery fire. In order to facilitate command and ensure complete security, County Magistrate Hu and Commander Yang moved to the residence of Zhang, the speaker of the Ningling County Council. At this time, the Communist bandits were even more arrogant because they had occupied the strongholds in the city. County Magistrate Hu knew that the situation was gone and there was no way to survive, so he wrote a poem with emotion and wrote it on the wall of Speaker Zhang's residence. The words were:</p>
<p>Why do you have to shed tears?</p>
<p>Taking righteousness and becoming benevolent is in this moment.</p>
<p>After thousands of years on the Huabiao pillar,</p>
<p>The loyal soul will still reach the people.</p>
<p>After County Magistrate Hu finished writing the poem, the sound of artillery became more and more dense, and it was at this moment that the Communist bandits poured into the city like bees. After two hours of street fighting, the team was almost completely killed or wounded, and Commander Yang was captured. County Magistrate Hu was worried and anxious, so he put on casual clothes and entered a butcher's house, wanting to find a sharp blade to commit suicide, but he could not find it anywhere. In the midst of extreme urgency, he suddenly found an iron spindle for spinning cotton. County Magistrate Hu grasped this iron spindle tightly and stabbed his head fiercely, immediately fainting to the ground. Later, he was discovered by the Communist bandits, who saw that he still had some breath and wanted to carry him to Zhao Zeng to claim credit. When they carried him to the outside of the South Gate, the traitorous bandits had already left the city. When they saw County Magistrate Hu's head covered in blood, they not only had no sympathy, but also increased their anger, so they used their guns to shoot at his head, and he died immediately. They pushed his body into the moat before leaving in a swarm. Afterwards, when the people heard about it, they retrieved the body from the moat and prepared a coffin at their own expense, and had it cremated on the left side of the South Gate of Ningling City.</p>
<p>Northern Henan fell earliest during the War of Resistance, and has been ravaged by the enemy for the past eight years. Now, after the Yellow River changed its course, the Communist bandits want to seize what they call the Jin-Yu-Lu corridor, which has become a place they are desperately fighting for. The common people are just tools in their eyes. The disaster that the local area has suffered from them is truly indescribable. Now, the war in northern Henan is still spreading, and the people's desire for the government to rescue them is like a severe drought hoping for clouds.</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Tracing Mr. Zhang Jian's Aspirations and Spirit</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuanyang</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong was the greatest and most accomplished entrepreneur in the modern Chinese enlightenment movement. His brilliant achievements in his career stemmed from his lofty and unique aspirations and spirit. To continue and promote Mr. Nantong's cause and spirit, we must first understand the characteristics of his aspirations and spirit. Here, I respectfully present my humble observations, elucidating Mr. Nantong's career aspirations and spiritual manifestations, for the consideration of contemporary scholars who admire this virtuous predecessor.</p>
<p>One. Mr. Nantong's Career Aspirations</p>
<p>First, Mr. Nantong's career progressed from private to public, transforming private interests into public benefit. His career development seemed to follow a certain thread and process: first industry, then education, followed by charity and public welfare, and then military and political affairs. Industry was a privately run enterprise, while education and charity were services for the public. Even in terms of industry and education, they were initially privately operated, but then transformed into company or board organizations to serve the public and contribute to society. He was undoubtedly an orthodox figure in Chinese philosophy, adhering to the Confucian principles of "success need not be mine" and "the world belongs to all." At the same time, he also possessed the Taoist virtues of "acting without possessing" and "retiring after success." This is a virtue that modern entrepreneurs, especially those who value utilitarianism, can hardly demonstrate. Mr. Nantong was born into this, practiced it personally, and fulfilled his task of setting an example for future generations.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Nantong often exhausted his own efforts and extended them to others when running his businesses. The period in which he started new businesses was not as convenient as it is now. Although conditions were inadequate and obstacles were numerous, he advanced with a strong determination, indomitable perseverance, and a steadfast commitment to exhausting his own efforts, infused with the Buddhist spirit of "I will enter hell." Once the business showed a glimmer of hope, he quickly turned it into a model, creating a reputation for it, so that people from near and far would come to visit and learn. This was not to show off or use it as a political means. If one were to look at running a business from a commercial perspective, one should seek exclusive patents. Why encourage everyone to compete and rush to do the same thing? Therefore, this approach was solely to enable all localities to follow suit, taking the same path, to benefit the country and the people. This is the consistent principle of patriotism and love for the people, extending oneself to others with loyalty and empathy, practically applied in business.</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Nantong always maintained benevolence in his heart and clarity in his actions. Mr. Zhang's sentiment always embraced the Buddhist teachings of compassion for all beings, aiming to save the world and its people. Therefore, when he started his production business in an era of uncertainty and lack of resources, it was naturally not for making money but for saving the country and its people. Every bit of effort was aimed at benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood. He can truly be considered a person who maintained benevolence in his heart and practiced great benevolence with great wisdom and courage. At the same time, he believed that to be benevolent to the people, one must start with cherishing things and using production as a means, so that benevolence to the people would not be empty. Therefore, he reclaimed tens of millions of acres of barren saline land on the coast of northern Jiangsu, transforming it into fertile cotton fields and large-scale salt production sites, directly supporting millions of people and creating dozens of towns. Isn't this the fruit of his great benevolence, wisdom, and courage? At that time, he believed that the country was in a critical and precarious state, and what he was doing were practical things to save the country and its people. He wanted foreigners to know, and neighboring countries to acknowledge, that even if China were to unfortunately perish, there was still someone whose heart would not perish; even if China were in chaos, there were still people with a vision working to build a country for lasting peace and stability. This kind of vision and the sentiment of a loyal minister in troubled times are truly sad and touching, stirring the heart!</p>
<p>Fourth, Mr. Nantong was good at establishing education based on affairs and achieving success through education. Mr. Zhang's establishment of new education had a special contribution and status in the history of Chinese education. He focused on military and national education, normal school education, and practical talent education. He was a writer and a politician but did not run literature or law education. He wanted to run businesses, so he had an education to match each business, creating the profound saying "Father industry, mother education." Therefore, Nantong had all kinds of educational undertakings to match various businesses. Specialization, technicalization, socialization, and militarization in education were his educational goals. Establishing education based on affairs in this way can ensure education for all without waste. At the same time, he also used education to promote the establishment, growth, and development of some businesses. Any business that cannot be academic and specialized will not have a bright future and long-term progress. Mr. Zhang's sharp eyes saw this early on. When he founded China's textile industry, he also founded textile education at the same time. Textile factories nourished textile education, and textile education provided the textile industry with specialized technical talents. Although this is only one example, it can encompass all other businesses and education.</p>
<p>Two. Mr. Nantong's Spiritual Manifestations</p>
<p>First, the spirit of pioneering and establishing traditions despite humble beginnings. Looking at the businesses personally founded by Mr. Zhang, each business was unprecedented, transforming from nothing to something. They were always carried out in a bold and pioneering manner. Whether it was textiles, salt reclamation, water conservancy, transportation, or even education, all included a spirit of creation. This is truly the spirit necessary for the great era of building an industry and a country. At that time, there was a group of people who advocated preserving the national essence, saying "Chinese learning for substance, Western learning for application." It seemed that the spirit of creation was not very necessary. Even today, fifty years later, there are still some conservatives who say that national affairs only need to be done step by step, without the need for any drastic measures, as if saying that the stage of China's industrial revolution can be bypassed. This is really a seemingly correct but actually misleading obstacle to construction, conflicting with Mr. Zhang's creative spirit. In the past and even now, if we talk about construction, industrialization, or agricultural scientification without this creative spirit and iron hand, then there will be numerous obstacles, making it impossible to move forward and making it impossible to talk about starting and developing a business. Mr. Zhang not only started businesses, but also wanted each business to last for a long time, becoming a set of systems and being effective when implemented throughout the country. This spirit of pioneering and establishing traditions, passing it on for thousands of years, has been possessed by Mr. Nantong alone in modern times.</p>
<p>Second, the spirit of learning from others' strengths and doing good to others. Mr. Zhang was an orthodox figure in Confucianism and one of the masters with the deepest foundation in Chinese learning, but Mr. Zhang's philosophy of life and attitude towards learning were very modern and scientific, and could be effectively applied to all matters of helping the world and starting businesses. In order to study Chinese embroidery techniques, he boldly broke through the old etiquette and sought advice from a female newspaper writer, conducting joint research. In order to improve the old opera, he rewarded the old opera industry, spiritual skills, and made it a great success. This is a scientific attitude. As for education and business, he always put others first, followed European and American norms, and established corporate organizations. He did not act independently or selfishly monopolize, but gathered human and material resources from all over the country to jointly initiate and operate. This attitude and spirit of being kind to others, learning from others' strengths, constantly innovating, and striving for excellence is forever worthy of emulation by future generations.</p>
<p>Third, the spirit of valuing substance and rejecting extravagance, discarding falsehood and upholding simplicity. Mr. Zhang's main points for running education were to discuss less, read more, learn to be quiet, and remove agitation. The school mottoes he wrote for various schools were: "Strive for excellence," "Be loyal and honest," "Be focused and dedicated," and "Be diligent, thrifty, and simple." The education Mr. Zhang ran was for agriculture, textiles, water conservancy, veterinary medicine, female workers, the blind and deaf, and sericulture. The industries Mr. Zhang advocated were also like the various educational undertakings he founded. The promotion of this spirit of valuing substance and rejecting extravagance, and the transformation of the atmosphere of discarding falsehood and upholding simplicity, were truly a good medicine for a country and society that had been weak and chaotic for a long time. It is a pity that he spent more time as a private citizen and less time in power, so Hu Shi called him a failed hero. In fact, the inspiration and encouragement of this spirit has not declined for a long time. To this day, the successors of various businesses in Nantong have adhered to it unremittingly. How can it be said that it has not been successful, and how can it be said that it is not a greater and longer success?</p>
<p>Fourth, building the foundation and saving the countryside at the same time. Since ancient times, Chinese patriots have often held two different views on national affairs: one is to advocate first focusing on political construction, and then on education and economic construction; the other is to advocate only engaging in people's livelihood construction, gradually progressing to political construction. Mr. Nantong did not lean towards either of these two views. He advocated focusing on people's livelihood construction, but if there was a need to take the path of political construction first in the course of people's livelihood construction, then it would be okay to try it first. However, he also discovered a new path, which is to build the country from the construction of the countryside. Many people have followed this path later, and Mr. Nantong was the first to discover it. Although the political system was not on the right track and people's livelihood became increasingly dilapidated, merely creating a "Peach Blossom Spring" could not change the overall situation of the Five Dynasties and Sixteen Kingdoms. Therefore, on the surface, it seems that he did not achieve much. However, a society and politics that is like an inverted pagoda, top-heavy, cannot last or stand firm no matter what. In the future, we still need to follow the path discovered by Mr. Zhang in order to have a future. This is another conclusion that can be drawn. The seeds of building the countryside and the country have already been painstakingly sown by Mr. Zhang in those years, and sooner or later they will blossom and bear fruit on this fertile land of China for the enjoyment of our compatriots.</p>
<p>In short, the present era, on the one hand, is more advanced than the period in which Mr. Zhang lived, but on the other hand, its chaos and urgency are even greater than in Mr. Nantong's time. Mr. Zhang in his time had already done his best in his career, knowing that it was impossible but still doing it, greatly influencing society, contributing to the era, and benefiting the country. If successors can truly follow Mr. Zhang's career and spiritual path forward, I firmly believe that the present era and country still have plenty of room for heroes to use their abilities, and every place in China, a country with vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population, can become Nantong. What is lacking and needed is only Mr. Nantong's aspirations and spirit.</p>

<h3>"How to Write"?</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>Often many young friends who love literature and art write to me, or run to my home to ask me a question that seems very troublesome, but is actually very simple: that is, "How to write"?</p>
<p>There are already many books on the subject of writing guidance on the book stalls. I don't want to repeat what others have said again. Here, I just want to tell young friends that there are a few basic understandings that should be had for literary writing.</p>
<p>If you always complain that your writing is not good, this is wrong, because you must not have asked yourself very rationally and calmly:</p>
<p>(1) Do I have the ability to write?</p>
<p>(2) Do I know what's wrong with my writing?</p>
<p>(3) Is my writing bad because of innate stupidity? Or is it because I haven't read enough books? Have I written too few articles?</p>
<p>(4) Do I like to revise my articles?</p>
<p>(5) Am I willing to humbly accept criticism from others?</p>
<p>(6) If I submit an article to a certain newspaper or magazine and it is not published, do I complain about the editor, or do I complain about my own article?</p>
<p>(7) Before I write, do I spend a lot of time thinking? Do I first prepare the subject matter in my mind before writing?</p>
<p>(8) Is this subject matter the one I am most familiar with?</p>
<p>(9) Is the motivation for writing this article for submission? Or to practice my writing? Or is it for pleasure?</p>
<p>(10) If I submit an article to an editor, and it is not published several times, am I discouraged? Or do I continue to write with perseverance?</p>
<p>Young friends, I know, you will answer these ten questions well and sincerely. You certainly do not admit that you do not have the ability to write, nor can you see the faults in your articles. Perhaps you do not admit that your articles are bad, and suspect that these editors are prejudiced and unwilling to publish articles submitted by an unfamiliar young person. In fact, that kind of editor should no longer exist in modern times. If there is one, he is simply not worthy of being an editor. The reason why a work is not published is that limited space means that not every article can be published. Poor writing and unsuitable content are also reasons. Also, editors have their own personalities. Some value form, and some value content. Those who value form will publish your article as long as your writing is beautiful, regardless of whether the content is empty or not. Those who value content will publish your article as long as the subject matter of this novel or poem is good, the story is touching, and the ideas are correct, even if the writing is a little lacking. When you submit an article, if you encounter someone who values form, and you happen not to pay attention to form, then naturally he will not publish your article. When you encounter that kind of thing, you must not be angry, but humbly reflect on what is wrong with my article. I should carefully reread and revise it. If you can send this article to a teacher or a few friends to see and listen to their criticisms, this will be more practical and useful to you than reading several books on creative methods.</p>
<p>Before you write, you must choose a subject matter that you are most familiar with, and review the characters in the novel in your mind several times. You must make the characters in the novel come alive before your eyes, not only to see their faces clearly, but also to hear their voices clearly. You must fully understand their personalities, their thoughts, and their living habits. As for the relationships or entanglements between them, you should write them down as if you saw them with your own eyes. Do not write too exaggeratedly, do not write too excessively, but follow human nature and be reasonable, and make the reader feel that the novel is real, and that the people are real. Even if the characters in your novel are completely imaginary, you must write them as if they really exist, and that this person is a typical figure of a certain class in society. We often encounter them unknowingly; but we do not know their actual living conditions, nor do we know that their lives are so difficult, and their spirits are so painful. You write them so vividly and so realistically, and your writing skills, needless to say, have already reached a mature stage at this time. But how can you reach a mature stage? That all depends on your own efforts.</p>
<p>A painter does not know how many revisions it takes to write a beautiful picture. A farmer must have at least several years of farming experience to know when to plant what kind of seeds; what kind of soil is suitable for planting what. A composer does not know how many times he has to try to sing, how many times he has to correct, to make a successful song. Can writing an article become famous without many revisions and without a long period of learning? Even if they are special geniuses, they are strict and diligent in the learning process. They did not expect to become famous by chance, but the facts made him get unexpected rewards. Many people gave him the beautiful name of a writer. In fact, what is so rare about a writer? What is so proud about? Isn't he the same as an ordinary person? The difference is that his sensitivity is especially fast, he is especially rich in sympathy, justice, his vision is sharper than ordinary people, and his mind is more complex than ordinary people. He wants to shout for those unfortunate people, to vent their sorrows, troubles, miseries, and misfortunes; and these sorrows, sufferings, miseries, and misfortunes, are what many people want to write but cannot write; what many people want to know but do not know. So our writer writes all these things completely. He brings out the reader's tears, awakens the reader's sympathy; he grabs the reader, controls the reader; he can make the reader cry, and he can also make the reader laugh; he can make the reader sleepless, and he can also make the reader jump up with excitement. This is the power of literature, and also the success of the writer! Also, dear young friends, patience and perseverance are the keys to literary success. If you don't write more and revise more, your articles will never be good. If you want to ask me: "How can I make my articles good"? I only have a very simple answer: "Write more, revise more, and learn more"!</p>
<p>There is still more to say about this topic, I will write about it again when I have time.</p>
<h3>"Pu Feng" and Pu Feng</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw a piece of news in the newspaper, the general idea of which is this:</p>
<p>A certain young man (pen name Pu Feng), who usually writes articles for the Central Daily News and the former Qianjiang Daily News supplements, because of the poverty of his life, carried a pistol one day and carried out a robbery on the street. He was arrested by the police and sent to the court. He confessed without denial, and was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the court, etc....</p>
<p>At this time and place, things like carrying a gun and robbing people are already close to dog bites, and they are not considered "news"; however, it finally attracted people's attention--at least the attention of some people. The reason is probably due to the general people--especially friends in the literary world and general literary youth--cannot help but feel the feeling of "the end of the literati"?</p>
<p>As for me and some friends who write poetry, in addition to this, we cannot help but be attracted by the pen name "Pu Feng".</p>
<p>Probably people who have paid some attention to the poetry of the Anti-Japanese War and before--especially before the war--will not fail to know that there was a poet "Pu Feng" in the new poetry world of those years, right? Because he not only published many poems in various literary and artistic publications at that time, but also published several collections of long and short poems, such as "Vast Night", "June Fiery Fire", "Life", "Poor Bug", "Under the Banner of the Anti-Japanese War"...etc.</p>
<p>Because of this reason, readers of this kind must inevitably have such a question when they see this news: Is this "Pu Feng" the same Pu Feng who wrote poetry?…</p>
<p>The motive for me to write this short article is precisely to answer this question.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to tell you exactly: This "Pu Feng" is definitely not the poet Pu Feng.</p>
<p>Because the poet Pu Feng died of illness in the enemy's rear in Jiangnan during the Anti-Japanese War. How can a person who has been dead for several years suddenly come back to life and carry out a robbery?</p>
<p>Therefore, obviously, this "Pu Feng" who robs people, although he is also a person who writes articles, is definitely not the poet Pu Feng of those years.</p>
<p>The author and the late poet Pu Feng have a small hometown friendship, and later there were many times when they were often together, so they know everything about him in more detail; therefore, after seeing this news, I deeply feel that it is necessary to correct it on behalf of the dead. Because in the current social situation, being able to have the courage to be a robber may even be something to be envied; however, since the matter was not done by a deceased friend, it is not convenient to "take credit", so I have to make a correction and statement on his behalf.</p>
<p>Finally, I, the author, also have a point of feeling, that is: in the literary world, people using the same pen name are often found. And this situation seems to be divided into intentional and accidental. If it is due to accidental coincidence, there is nothing to criticize, but for the convenience of each other, it is still best to change it as soon as possible, so as not to develop into a double-bag case that makes people laugh and cry in various situations. If the matter is intentional, then no matter what the motive, it is not worth emulating! Such as the pen name "Lu Xun", although as far as I know, Mr. Zhou Shuren did not register a patent with the Ministry of the Interior that day, but when a young man "Lu Xun" was also discovered in Hangzhou, then no matter what, we would not suspect that Mr. Zhou was "fake", right?…</p>

<h3>Fragments of Words Life</h3>
<p>— Qingguo</p>
<p>Life is a real song, it should be sung loudly and brightly.</p>
<p>Don't say it's bitter, don't say it's sad; it's originally fragrant and happy.</p>
<p>It's spring, the mountains and forests are green, and the river is green. And your grass-green scout uniform? Are you going out?</p>
<p>Look, the sun is smiling. Let the sun shine on your moldy grass-green scout uniform.</p>
<p>Come out, it's so fresh and wide outside! Your song can definitely be sung better.</p>
<p>Childhood</p>
<p>Is it true that childhood is golden days?</p>
<p>Cherish it, know how to cherish the life you grew up from golden days.</p>
<p>Children have the most dreams, may your dreams have a pair of transparent翹, carrying life, flying freely in the blue sky.</p>
<p>But don't fall down, don't be like a kite floating in the spring, greedy for the east wind, and finally falling on the young branches or the laughing river.</p>
<p>You are healthy. Happiness will always point you in the direction.</p>
<p>Night</p>
<p>Night, white night, like a desolate white desert night.</p>
<p>Now, I am still carrying green hopes; tracking sparse and blurred footprints, trekking in the vast desert of the world.</p>
<p>When, oh when, can I get to the oasis?</p>
<p>More miserable than camel bells, I am constantly shaking my bells. Really lonely, this thin and thirsty place. …</p>
<p>Song</p>
<p>Song, red song, like a burning red flame song.</p>
<p>The song burns me, burns the night, burns the dancers in the night.</p>
<p>However, not long after, the singing stopped.</p>
<p>I painfully and silently put life on my own heartstrings.</p>
<p>Who else can listen to a little bit of my voice?…</p>
<p>May the wind and sand be thicker! May the song be buried inside!</p>
<h3>Katie's Letter</h3>
<p>— Haynes King</p>
<p>Since the seventeenth century, there has been a school of painters whose works are exclusively focused on the interior of village houses. Their paintings are mostly small and depict a story. "Katie's Letter" is a representative work of this kind of painting. The author was born in Barbados in 1831 and died in 1904. He went to Lei's School in England at a young age, and began to exhibit his works at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1855. The size of the screens of his lifetime works did not exceed the size of a box.

<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 331</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Volume One: Seven Secret Letters, Chapter Nine: Perilous Journey</p>
<p>Summary of Previous Events</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, millions of brave and patriotic sons and daughters of China shed their bright red blood across every inch of our land to defend the motherland. I am collecting these tragic stories to commemorate the arduous task of recovering lost territories. (However, mere commemoration is not enough! Only two years have passed since the victory, old wounds remain untreated, and new ones increase daily; therefore, besides commemorating our comrades who have sacrificed themselves, we must also be thoroughly vigilant, firmly guard our positions, recognize the enemy, and when the time comes, be prepared to shed our last drop of blood, vowing to fight this even more poisonous enemy.)</p>
<p>First Story: "Seven Secret Letters" - Records the agreement between Japanese pirates and the leaders of other countries to prepare for the outbreak of World War II. Tsurumi Tama (Gu Cheng Zhi) was dissatisfied with the Japanese pirates' burning, killing, looting, and poisoning policies. At the same time, he discovered that he was originally a descendant of the old revolutionary Gu Ji Han, so he used his position in the Japanese Imperial Army General Staff as cover, gathered comrades in secret, set up twelve secret radio stations, and risked his life to participate in the Black Dragon Society, wanting to expose these "Seven Secret Letters" and attempt to save humanity from the great calamity.</p>
<p>The first search for the secret letters was unsuccessful; He encountered the mysterious female spy Nakamura Heiko, and the two cooperated, risking their lives to destroy the war demon's "Eight Secrets" within forty-eight hours. However, another female comrade of Tsurumi's, Ji Qun, was unable to participate in this action, feeling lonely, so she bravely set out, went to Guanwai, gathered comrades, and opened up another route to track down the spy group that had infiltrated the Northwest, giving them a blow.</p>
<p>On August 1st, Tsurumi and Heiko settled things in Shanghai. Heiko answered a summons, boarded a ship and returned directly to her country, and Tsurumi also rushed to Beiping after receiving my secret telegram.</p>
<p>Originally, a week ago, we had completely arranged the problem of the transplant station, and I only needed to lead my subordinates along the Ping Sui Line to Datong, and then transfer to Taiyuan, without any twists and turns. Part of Ji Qun's group also decided to return to Pan Yi's group on the day Tsurumi set off for Shanghai, to increase their strength and then rush to Taiyuan. All actions and supply items were planned in detail.</p>
<p>However, on the second day of finalizing the plan (July 31st), the situation in Pingjin changed too much. At the same time, we received urgent intelligence from Tokyo "012" and Panyang "02", knowing that the North China Army Department, in order to respond to the "Eight Secrets" campaign, was also preparing for a shocking performance, and Songbu Doihara simultaneously launched a movement to reorganize the intelligence network. Because of the support of the Black Dragon Society's executive cadres, Doihara actually declared arrogantly: "Regardless of whether the superiors allow it or not, I would rather sacrifice my own authority to achieve my goal!" The main focus of this goal is on the communications department of the intelligence network. In other words, he wants to cancel Tsurumi's position.</p>
<p>On August 1st and 2nd, I and Mr. W discussed many plans, but none were decided. On the 3rd and 4th, Tsurumi returned to Beiping and also discussed several practical methods with us in detail; At the same time, he issued several confidential deployment instructions to "012" and "02"; waiting for a reply, we would launch a counterattack according to the plan. Little did we know that before these two replies arrived, Konoe had a clear telegram, conveyed by Matsui to Tsurumi, summoning him back to the country for "training for a week" - W also received urgent reports from "012", "02", etc., conveyed by Tsurumi, "The atmosphere is bad, return to the country quickly to make arrangements; Although the previous instructions were followed, due to new sudden changes, I am afraid there will be no practical benefit."</p>
<p>Troubles, either don't come; when they come, they always come one after another. This can also be applied to the old saying: "Good fortune never comes in pairs, misfortune never comes singly!"</p>
<p>The second shocking news was also received by Mr. W's headquarters; "Ping Zhuan, Tsurumi Tama Sama: Brother Tama - Nakamura Heiko, was suddenly detained due to the Shanghai case in China, and is under house arrest, waiting for Brother Tama to return to Kyoto to prove her innocence, or she may be able to clear up the dispute. Liu Shi urgently reports."</p>
<p>There was also an even more terrible message, delivered from Tianjin, which was a secret distress telegram: - The secret general station of the anti-conspiracy organization in Tianjin was broken by Japanese secret agents; Most of the important personnel were captured. Yaoqun returned to Ping from Shenyang, passing through Tianjin, and is suspected of rescuing comrades, and is said to have been detained by the Japanese. Xiao Hucheng (Little Tiger) has now fled, the Japanese are searching very urgently, and the Tianjin puppet police are identifying him as a "child demon" and are offering a reward for his capture.</p>
<p>Announcement - The remaining two drafts of this volume, "Seven Secret Letters", will be published, and a separate edition will be published immediately. Volume Two, "Outpost No. 12" may also be published at the same time. Thank you to the readers for your inquiries, this is to inform you... Also, a few weeks ago, several family members suffered from dangerous illnesses, and the school was also holding final exams at the end of the semester. My body and mind were exhausted, and I was unable to proofread, resulting in an interruption of two weeks. Now that the final exams are over and the sick have escaped danger and are recovering, I sincerely apologize to all the readers - the author)</p>
<p>Dream</p>
<p>Dream, a blue dream, like a dream of a vast blue sky.</p>
<p>Bright stars twinkling in the blue sky.</p>
<p>Smart people say: The stars in the sky are the good people on earth.</p>
<p>And when the stars have fallen completely, dawn is near.</p>
<p>But, is it true that when the good people have almost all died, the ideal is near?</p>
<p>There are so many stars tonight, the sky seems extra blue. The night is also very deep...</p>
<h3>Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>There have been many commentators on Du Fu's poetry since ancient times, but Zheng Shanfu is the most pertinent in pointing out the flaws and shortcomings. Shanfu said: "The beauty of poetry lies in not having to say everything, not having to write everything as true, and what one wants to say and write is naturally conceivable, although it is conceivable but cannot be expressed, this is how one obtains the meaning of Feng Ren. Du Fu often goes to the point of truth and completeness, so he loses it." He also said: "Long poems are profound and eloquent, describing events and expressing emotions, with roots, joints, and bones. This is Du Fu's unique ability, and all the Tang people are inferior to him. However, poetry is not valued for this, but it can only be considered difficult. The Song people learned from him, often turning prose into poetry, and the elegant way was greatly damaged, starting from Du Fu." His arguments are so precise!</p>
<h3>Random Chat by Du Bo</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>The most unfortunate thing in the world is that the object of your love is an abuser of love. An abuser's love is like counterfeit money. It cannot alleviate the poverty of the recipient, but it can make the recipient angry because he feels cheated.</p>
<p>Recently, I reread Bedier's Tristan and Isolde. Since Christianity spread to Europe, this is the first passionate and poignant love story. Just as Mr. Zhu Mengshi said, we can see from it that the poets of the Middle Ages hid their firm courage behind their cowardly faces. This story has won countless people's tears because what it expresses is not abuse of love - single-minded love is more valuable than gold.</p>
<p>If not insult, then indignation.</p>
<p>Samuel Foote said: "White horses and beautiful women are similar, both old ones are difficult-to-manage troublesome things. The former is difficult to keep clean; the latter, although kept clean."</p>
<p>Perhaps he said this with feeling! I think this sentence should be applied to the Mississippian who uses Cui towel countries to eat appropriately. This kind of easily soiled beautiful woman will never have a feeling of love. What she calls love is just a misinterpretation of carnal desire.</p>
<p>Selfish and vulgar "love" is like a dog. What it chases, and what it soils the most, is the person it "loves" the most. Who says that true love can grow in selfish soil? Love is giving, not getting; love is a burden, not a venting.</p>
<p>Christ was willing to carry the cross, so he could achieve his great love. We are too lacking in love that carries the cross in this utilitarian, dog-eat-dog society.</p>
<p>Jealousy and selfishness are sisters. Being jealous of the happiness of the person you love is a shame. Secretly watching the person you deeply love go and kiss someone who is more expensive than you, and stubbornly and selfishly destroying the other person's happiness, is simply an unavoidable insult.</p>

<h3>Remembering the 74th Reorganized Division</h3>
<p>— A Bing</p>
<p>The 74th Reorganized Division, which was gloriously martyred in the Yimeng Mountain area this time, was formerly the 74th Army, which was famous throughout the country and transferred to Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. I remember when I joined the army in Changde, Hunan, in May of the 27th year of the Republic, I was assigned to the 58th Division under that army. At that time, the army commander was General Yu Jishi, and the deputy army commander was General Wang Yaowu, the current chairman of the Shandong Province. The commander of the 58th Division was General Feng Shengfa, and the brigade commander was General Lao Guanying. Brigade Commander Lao distinguished himself in the Battle of Mahui in Jiangxi. In the future, when compiling the history of the war, I am afraid his name will be indispensable.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 28th year, we went from Yuanling, Hunan, to Xiangyin. Suddenly, we heard that Commander Yu would come to inspect the team the next day. So we were ordered to cut our hair overnight. Xiangyin County is small, there are very few barbershops, and we soldiers have many comrades. Even the small apprentices in the barbershop had to be mobilized to serve us. The small apprentice held a mirror-like bayonet, shaving us like planing a gourd. Some places were left with a piece, and some places were scraped off the skin. The suffering was definitely not something that the wealthy and noble people sitting in first-class barbershops today could imagine.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 28th year, Commander Yu was ordered to transfer to the 86th Army in Zhejiang. Our division commander, Feng Shengfa, was also transferred to Zhejiang. General Yu Yaowu was promoted to army commander at this time, and General Chen Shizheng was transferred from Fenghua to succeed him as the commander of the 58th Division. However, his term of office was only five months, and during these five months, he participated in the Battle of Northern Jiangxi and the First Battle of Changsha, so there was no day of leisure. General Chen can also be said to have had a hard life. After Chen was dismissed, Deputy Division Commander Liao Lingqi was promoted to the position. Liao was from Qiyang, Hunan, a fourth-term student of the military academy. Although he was a military man, he was a big, fat man with a big belly, and he was also strict in governing the army. There was also a special feature, that is, his personal letters were mostly replied to by himself. I was working in the adjutant's office at the time, and I often saw his handwritten letters sent to the general post office for mailing, so Liao's subordinates were very fond of him. Unfortunately, during the Second Battle of Changsha in the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic, he was executed by firing squad in the Hengyang Garden for delaying military affairs.</p>
<p>The one who succeeded Liao was General Zhang Lingfu, who was martyred this time. General Zhang was originally Liao's deputy division commander. When the Battle of Changsha was lost, the troops lost contact and retreated to Hengyang. General Zhang was promoted for his meritorious service in accommodating the retreating soldiers, so he was not only not punished, but also promoted. This was also unexpected at first. Also, General Cai Renjie, the deputy division commander who was martyred this time, was only a regimental commander at that time. It was not until the first half of the 34th year that General Wang Yaowu was ordered to be promoted to the commander of the Fourth Front Army, and General Shi Zhongcheng, the commander of the 57th Division, was transferred to succeed him as the army commander. Later, Shi was transferred again. According to his merits, General Zhang succeeded him. After the reorganization, he was re-elected as the division commander until his martyrdom in Yimeng Mountain. The entire 74th Reorganized Army was gloriously martyred before the end was announced.</p>
<p>After this, I don't know who will receive this honorary designation? Recalling that the 74th Army was established in the early days of the War of Resistance, its strict military discipline has long been praised by people all over the country, and its glorious achievements will be eternally recorded in history books. We were one of its members when it was first established, climbing thousands of mountains and wading through thousands of rivers for three or four years. Now, hearing this bad news, I cannot help but feel sad. I would like to sincerely pay my respects to all the officers and soldiers of the 74th Army, and to my classmates and friends at that time.</p>
<h3>Summer Vacation Plan</h3>
<p>— Xie Zhangtao</p>
<p>The summer vacation has begun, and a series of long summer days are waiting to be spent. Perhaps many people have plans and have formulated forms, etc., waiting to be realized. However, because of the monotonous life and heavy courses of the past semester, the tense and tired bodies and minds will throw these planned forms to the back of their minds when they get into the relaxed atmosphere of the vacation; The result is sleeping, chatting, strolling in the park, wandering on the road, and spending the summer in a daze. I remember at a Saturday discussion held by the public rescue team, I proposed the topic of "How to Spend the Summer Vacation", and in order to prepare for my speech, I had the following prejudices, which may resonate with some people!</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, one should learn some life-necessary skills, such as swimming, first aid (artificial respiration, hemostasis, simple bandaging, etc.), horseback riding, tree climbing (mountain climbing, rope climbing, etc.), shooting, rowing, etc. Learning these skills may be very expensive, or you may not be able to learn them in the city, or it may take a long time, but the money and time you spend will never be wasted, or you will get ten times or a hundred times the return, or even save your most precious life, which is also the highest return for learning these skills. In your long life history, these skills may have a decisive role in distinguishing between life and death in times of crisis. Taking swimming as an example, recently there have been repeated reports of maritime shipping accidents, only to see dozens or hundreds of people drowning, but there have been no examples like in Europe and the United States of people struggling in the sea for several hours, or grabbing onto floating objects and floating for dozens of hours and being rescued. This is clear evidence that the people of our country have not learned to swim and have neglected life-saving techniques. Also, with first aid methods, whether it is artificial respiration, hemostasis, or simple bandaging, they can show great effectiveness in times of crisis. Sometimes, without preliminary first aid, even with a doctor's diagnosis and treatment and surgery, it is difficult to save the situation.</p>
<p>In the process of one's life, one cannot absolutely avoid the occurrence of accidents and crises. Learning these necessary skills is really a good way to prepare for a rainy day!</p>
<h3>The Strange Effect of Color</h3>
<p>— Guo Yongnian</p>
<p>Since Newton discovered the seven-color light band by observing with a prism, the world has long understood the basic principles of color. In practical applications, people have always only used different colors from an aesthetic point of view; Selecting colors using scientific methods to achieve certain special effects has only been a matter of recent years. The following facts may be used as a reference for us:</p>
<p>An American Chicago cheese factory specially painted a large piece of glass window in the factory building blue. The outside of the window was no longer crowded with flies, while the outside of the other glass was still densely covered with thick swarms of flies. So blue is the color to repel flies. In the United States, there are also deep orange-yellow electric lights specially used to repel mosquitoes.</p>
<p>A large hotel in New York with light green interior walls had good business, but the manager complained that customers stayed in the store for too long. After being instructed by a color expert, the walls were repainted with alternating red and yellow colors, and the turnover of customers accelerated, increasing profits by 50%.</p>
<p>In a factory in the western United States, the temperature inside the factory building was constantly maintained at 72 degrees, but the female workers often complained to the factory that they felt cold. The factory owner ordered that a part of the sunlight be blocked with a blue glass recently. Inadvertently, he discovered that repainting the entire blue-green wall coral-colored would eliminate the workers' complaints of coldness.</p>
<p>When the workers in another factory were carrying black metal boxes filled with cigarette holders, they often complained of back pain. Later, when the boxes were repainted light green, some workers claimed that the boxes were much lighter than before.</p>
<p>Using the simple principle that white leather reflects heat and black absorbs heat, a packing company in New York painted its roof white in the spring, and the temperature in the hot summer was several degrees lower. In the winter, it was repainted black to absorb heat. The craftsmen who installed the water radiators discovered that the heat generated by the fifth gear of a white water radiator was the same as the sixth gear of a gilded or black water radiator.</p>
<p>Uncoordinated colors can injure the eyes, causing fatigue and nervous tension. In a textile factory in Caroline, female workers who specialized in inspecting the weave of twill fabrics often had to look up at the white walls to rest because the fabric was green and rotating very quickly. At this time, the white wall appeared peach-colored in their eyes. When they lowered their heads to work again, it took several seconds to recover their vision. After research by the factory's engineers, the white walls were repainted pinkish-peach, and the working efficiency was greatly increased.</p>
<p>The Scripps Institution of Oceanography has discovered that a large number of small crustaceans attached to the hulls of ships and called "barnacles" like dark colors the most. If the underwater hull is repainted light green or white, this type of annoying dirt can be greatly reduced. This simple invention has already saved the US shipping industry $100 million annually in "barnacle removal" costs!</p>
<p>Due to the experience gained during the war, the American industry knows that fully colorized factories can increase production by 15% to 30%, so thousands of factories have adopted new color methods. Nowadays, the machine bodies of standard iron factories are painted light gray, and the working parts are painted cream-colored, making them stand out from the machine body; the ceilings are painted white; the walls and pillars are painted gray-green below eight feet; the floors are painted light yellow or gray; the fire-fighting equipment is red; the rescue supplies are green; dangerous objects such as low beams, edges of platforms and low holes, crane hooks and cargo cars are painted with yellow stripes on a black background. Such color distribution looks very harmonious and pleasing to the eye, but it has nothing to do with art, and is completely designed for function. According to reports from various factories that have adopted the above colors, the brightness of the factory building can be increased by one time; the accuracy of work can be increased by 40%; workers' unauthorized absence from their posts can be reduced by 60%; the occurrence of accidents can be reduced by 20% to 40%; the value of the reduction in the loss of parts discarded on the ground can offset all the paint modification costs in two months.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Popular Songs in America</p>
<p>"Singing and dancing in peace and prosperity" - only America deserves to be described in this way. Almost everyone who has an interest in literature and art can casually write a few poems and compose a few songs. Female composers are as numerous as carps crossing the river. They participate in the Xiaoshi Dun Pen Club and the Writers Association, which hold weekly meetings to select songs. If the material is novel and the citizens like to sing it, it becomes a popular song Hit parade. Many popular songs are published every week, most of which are adopted by film companies and recorded. Songs that were popular in the United States five years ago are now popular in Shanghai dance halls. The lifespan of popular songs in the United States is very short, and on average, no one sings them after less than a year. Some popular songs are really vulgar and unbearable, like Pistol Packing Mama, which can be said to be worthless. It was popular in the southern provinces. Not only Americans sing it, but also students studying in the United States. The women in the southern United States wear cowboy clothes, leather vests, short tassel skirts, wide-brimmed hats, and half-high boots, and carry guns. That kind of dress is more heroic than the Thirteenth Sister. We weak scholars cannot help but take three steps back when we see them. There are good works in popular songs, for example, the one sung by Joan Leslie at the Hollywood Center (I don't know the Chinese translation) is unprecedented. However, a good song still needs a beautiful woman to sing it. Joan Leslie sings it so round and graceful, but if you change to another person, it will be boring. Recently, some people in Shanghai have followed suit, but their English pronunciation is inaccurate and the tune is a bit like Shanghai Opera. It's neither Chinese nor Western, and it makes my skin crawl. It's really uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>"Fragrant Name Everywhere in Bricks"</h3>
<p>— Ma Gao</p>
<p>Like the author's other adapted plays, the dialogue is smooth and fluent, the structure is concise and clear, and the characters are economical. It is a so-called comedy, but they are equally uninteresting to us. I always feel that this type of work is empty on the surface and lacks content, giving the audience what? Besides a burst of laughter, there is a feeling of emptiness.</p>
<p>As the theme of this play, the "teaching" of a soap industry tycoon, leading a纨绔子弟 from a wandering and dissipated habit to the right path, then what method does he use? What path does his son take after being stimulated? What is shown here is the vast magical power of the "bad Shanghai School", the fluke success of empty-handed scams, and the Yangchang habits that are close to hooliganism. Therefore, the answers to many questions are too skillful, making people dare not believe them: just imagine a company that only has advertisements flying all over the sky and only four soap samples in the office, how can it... In short, there are too many doubts in this play.</p>
<p>Moreover, the industrialist's scene is written too smoothly. At this moment, serious industrialists who are engaged in real production are probably unable to breathe under the squeeze of high interest rates. It is a pity that the author does not use his pen to describe the real situation.</p>
<p>The director is also the author, so it is naturally convenient to be familiar with the road. Therefore, the performance is very appropriate, and the handling of the atmosphere and rhythm is fast and neat.</p>
<p>Today, when it is difficult to perform dramas, and there is this good opportunity to gather so many excellent actors, why not choose a play with more realistic significance to perform? And it only takes six days to rush out the play, which is simply sloppy and wasteful. Friends who are engaged in supporting the drama movement should always be vigilant and not let commercial interests infiltrate our hearts too much. Over time, the misfortune of being spurned by the masses will be inevitable.</p>
<h3>On the National Education Classes in This City</h3>
<p>— Chen Rongjie</p>
<p>"National Education Class" is an abbreviation for "National Education Training Class," encompassing both children and adults. This name only began to be noticed around two years ago. In other words, the National Education Class has been implemented for less than two years; its history is quite short.</p>
<p>The Education Bureau has put in a lot of effort to organize the National Education Classes, finally coming up with this approach. To promote universal education, the city schools could not temporarily accommodate so many out-of-school citizens, so they borrowed classrooms from private schools, using the spare time and facilities in the afternoon to establish some small-scale municipal national schools. We do not deny, nor do we erase, the achievements of the National Education Classes since their implementation. Many out-of-school children wandering the streets, as well as amateur adults, have the opportunity to enroll. However, with advantages come disadvantages, especially for the National Education Classes, which are not yet fully organized and are like orphans without anyone to care for them. Their growth inevitably has many shortcomings.</p>
<p>Calling the National Education Classes "orphans" is not an overstatement. They have never been urged or cared for. In theory, they are so-called small-scale national schools, and everything should be the responsibility of the Education Bureau, but in reality, the Education Bureau's reach is insufficient. There is simply no way to manage them. The principals of private schools also feel a headache about these and are unwilling to take on the extra duties. Thus, these miserable "orphans" grow on their own without any supervision, and many problems inevitably arise.</p>
<p>Seeing that this term's National Education Classes are coming to an end, the next term's implementation is undoubtedly certain. It is hoped that the Education Bureau can have more comprehensive measures to eliminate the past flaws of insufficient enrollment, insufficient time, insufficient subjects, and insufficient training, and truly complete the rescue mission.</p>

<h3>The Science of Dreams (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Gu Junzheng</p>
<p>What is a Nightmare?</p>
<p>According to surveys, one in five people has experienced a nightmare, and only one in three dreams is entirely pleasant. Many authorities believe that nightmares are a manifestation of a very serious inner conflict and are the most important form of dreams because they stimulate the most intense psychological activity that can exist during sleep. According to reports from authorities, some people have died from nightmares due to high blood pressure or heart disease.</p>
<p>Do Dreams Have Any Meaning?</p>
<p>Dreams have very important meanings. Authorities have found that dreams not only show your daytime thoughts and actions but also reveal your personality. However, dreams cannot be interpreted literally. In fact, all dreams are symbolic—their true meaning is hidden in a metaphor or pure fantasy.</p>
<p>When the conscious mind constantly examines the subconscious mind, the subconscious disguises its true state as symbolic images to deceive the examiner. Most authorities believe that the examiner's cautious attitude is due to the following two reasons: (1) Humanity has an innate and inexplicable fear of the unknown; (2) Fear of revealing secrets, which would damage the dignity of the self?</p>
<p>Do Everyone Use the Same Symbols in Dreams?</p>
<p>Some symbols come entirely from past experiences. For example, if a child has been injured by a car, then dreaming of a car may symbolize pain or physical trauma; if the child has traveled in a car on holiday, then dreaming of a car may symbolize freedom or escape from the constraints of daily life.</p>
<p>However, some symbols appear repeatedly in everyone's dreams and have a basic or general meaning. It is common for the father to be symbolized as a king, teacher, God, or police officer, and the mother to be symbolized as a queen, land, or even someone else's mother. These and similar basic symbols are deeply rooted in the human subconscious and can be traced back to the symbolic hieroglyphs of primitive people. However, even these basic symbols often change with individual experiences, and no symbol has the same meaning for everyone.</p>
