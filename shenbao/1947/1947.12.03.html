<h3>對日和約初步程序　英美正進行商討　蘇聯所提建議將遭反對</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：據英國外交部方面消息，英美兩國在過去數日中會就對日和約之初步程序進行商討。權威方面人士相信，此係表示在討論對日和約時，英美將採取共同立塲，反對中蘇兩關所提成立大國否決權之建議。蘇聯昭會中主張四強外長於明年一月問在中國召開會議討論對日和約問題，英外交部刻正予以審愼考慮中。英外交部方面人士預料，英國將反對蘇方所提建議，理由爲外長會議之或立，乃在處理歐洲間題，美國大致將採取類似立塲。英國將支持美國主張，即初步考慮對日和約，應由遠東十一個會員國會同商討，（如將巴基斯坦與緬甸包括在內，應爲十一國。）所有法議，應由大多數表決，不得使用否決權。澳洲對否決權反對尤烈，主張遠東各國應有平等發言權。外交觀察家相信蘇方所以提出此項建　，乃在討論對德和約時一種討價還價之張本，但英美在倫敦外長會議結束前，顯不願提及日本問題。</p>

<h3>安定民生的第一步！</h3>
<p>行政院昨日擧行政務會議，討論經濟　亂急要措施方案；並爲穩定金融抑平物價以安定民生起見，通過財政部所擬在滬·津·漢·穗四大城市設立金融管理局之提案。當此民生憔悴感受「年終漲風」威脅之際，我上海市民聞及中樞採取此種賢明的措施，自無不竭誠擁議，並願該局平日在滬成立，澈底執行其時賢所謂「經濟戡亂」的任務。金融管理局之組織規程，截至執華時爲止，尙未在報端發表全文，但已悉該局將秉承財政部之命，辦理各地金融機構之檢査，監督，以及檢擧等事項，其聯掌約有下列八項：　審査及檢擧國家行局庫及其信託部之放款，投資，以及其他交易；　審在及檢舉省市銀行，中外商經營銀綫行莊，信託公司，保險公司，信用合作社及其附屬機構或其他經營金融業務之放款，匯款，投資以及其他交易；　督導及檢舉銀錢業聯合準備委員會及票據交換所；　檢擧及取締國營事業機關遠背公款承匯辦法；　檢舉及取締非法金融機構；　檢擧及取締黃金外幣外匯之非法買賣；　調査及報吿金融市塲之勸態；　美他財政部命令託辦及中央銀行委辦事項。</p>
<p>由此可知，金融管理局所負的使命，實在非常重大，尤其在金融市塲動盪不定的上海，對於管理金融機構之設立，此時格外覺得有其需要。我國艱苦抗戰了八年，在經濟上因遭敵僞的摧殘與蹂躪所受的損失，較乙任何一盟國爲慘重，故戰後的國計民生，可謂幾已到了民窮豺盡的困境。本來可望大職之後，休養生息，但是不幸得很，勝利沒有帶來和平，反而見到共匪的稱兵作亂，他們不是破壞國內的交通，就是摧毀工農生產，致使全國交通阻塞，生產停頓，民不聊生，飢寒交迫，究其長終目的，無非想藉此促成全國的經濟崩潰，而便利共匪的攫取政權。共匪懐有此種險謀詭計，不特爲全國朝野所共知，就是友邦人土也何嘗不洞燭其奸？目下正在軍事戡亂期問，軍事的與玫治的戡亂，固然最爲重要，但是共匪的作亂是無孔不入的，除了在軍事上政治上公然叛亂而外，並在經濟上階中擾亂市塲，企圖以經濟的紊亂與民生的不安，增强其在軍事上政治上的力量。所以我們要戡亂，一定要正本淸源，査明亂源。然後再對症發藥，始能奏戡亂之效。「經濟戡亂」的呼聲，所以由言綸而見諸事實者以此。今番金融管理局的設立，就負着這種神聖的任務。全國上下對於這個新機關的成立，應無不抱着極大的期望。茲就我們的觀感所及，略述一二，以供當局的考慮。第一，金融管理局的設立，旨在戲亂，而決非在造亂。故經濟界有亂象，須求其安定，而絕不增加其亂象。該局職掌，旣如上述八項，一望而知，純屬金融的管理。金融市塲的波動，物價必然隨其波動，原是最能影響及國計民生的。我們若要安定民生，誠然首應穩定金融，使其步入正常的職道。但是如何穩定上海的金緻市塲使其風平浪靜呢？不論在方法上，步驟上，都有縝密研究的必要；尤其不要忘記，金融政策必須配合國家的經濟政策。換言之，必須一方面穩定金融，而另一方面不致扼殺工商，否則無異於捨本逐末，表面上似乎一時可以抑平物價，而過了某一階段。生產更形萎縮，物資更見短少，其結果所屆，工商固不免有扼殺之痛，小民又何嘗有來蘇之感？關於這一點，我们不能不請財政常局在設置此新機構時，特別注意其所執行之政策是否與獎進生產玫策相符。</p>
<p>第二，未來的金融管理局，當爲依照昨日政務會議所通過的組織規程而設立的管理金融的地方機構。雖在四大都市同時設立，但上海是全國金融的中心，一波一浪，都要影響到全國的金融，所以上海的金融管理局在名義上是中央駐在地方的管理金融的機構，但在實際上無異具有全國性的。我們希望行將成立的上海金融管理局的一擧一動，都要能够合理合法；　句話說，就是要在國家生產政策之下，合法範圍之內，執行其戰務，完成其使命。負此使命的人，斷不可不明國家大局之所趨，社會人心之所向，而一味輕舉妄動，好大喜功，以致安定之效禾見’而社會已皇皇不可終日。</p>
<p>第三，依照組織規程的規定，金融管理局執行其職務時，當地政府及軍　機關，均應切實協助；如有發現應檢査事項時，當得隨時通知警局辦理。由此我們可以明瞭，至上海金融管理局正式成立之後，所右管理金融市塲的賣任，將完全由上海金融管理局負之，亦即完全由財政部負之，屆時不僅責任分明，而且事權也歸於統一了。今日談行政效率者，無不主張責任分明與事權統一，否則互相推諉，百事無成，所以市府當局與軍警機關至上海金融管理局成立之後，也就只負有「協助」其執行職務之資了。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要建議豺政當局，管制金融，僅是穩定金融的第一步，僅靠這一步驟，金融市塲能否平穩？民生能否安定？還是一個極嚴重的問題。上面已經說過，金融政策應配合經濟政策，單靠管理金融，是絕對不够的；而最實要的，乃在民生必需品的實行管制，取締投機囤積牟利，使其價格不致常常發生波動，這樣民生始稍趨安定。所以我們烯望中樞能繼金融管理局設立之後，再次第實行民生必需品的管理辦法，尤其是紗布食糧之類，首應實行合理的管制政策。英國自大戰爆發後，民生日用品就實行配給政策，迄至勝利二年後的今日，全國仍實行配給制度，一如戰時，實在是我國的一個好榜樣，値得我們的學習，惟回憶我國在抗戰期間，政府在重慶時代，對於民生日用品，亦曾設立管理局，如花紗布管制局之類，似乎都沒有什麼成績可言；但今日在戡亂期間設立各種管理局，切不可重蹈過去的覆轍，再暴露出政治人員的低能與無效率。所以我們主張，除非不再設立什麽管理局，否則就要講究行政效率，務使其貫澈任務，眞能達到安定民生的目的。</p>

<h3>聯合國勸募救濟兒童基金會　遠東區代表何慈柏發表聲明　在京與社部洽商成立中國委員會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕聯合國勸募救濟兒童基金委會遠軍區勸募代表伺慈柏，日前自美來華二日，由滬抵京與我社會部長谷正綱晤談後，下午三時半經政院新聞局介紹，舉行記者招待會，發表聲明稱：</p>
<p>「聯合國勸募救濟兒童工作，乃一自動捐輸援助舉世貧苦兒黨之全球性運動，此項動募運動，業經聯合國大會及經社理事會核准，並將在聯合國通　主持下，由每一國家爲響應動募而自動組織廣泛代表人民本身之勸募委會，負責推進，因此，聯合國勸募救濟兒童，乃爲國際間組織工作之一種獨特發展，各種國　之個人，均可藉此直接參與國際間之一項正式計劃，間爲歷史上之創擧，個人對於聯合國勸募救濟兒童工作損輸款項或貢獻善意，即與聯合國樹立私人關係，而個人此項行動，乃爲應付世界所遭遇之最緊念與根本之問題，即下一代之福祉，實際上亦即下一代之生存是。</p>
<p>就另一方面言，聯合國勸募救濟兒童工作，亦爲團結人羣之偉大行動，各國人民不論捐款多寡，均爲平等之參加者，若干國家本身需求殷切，其人民自不能如目今處境較佳諸國人民捐輸之多，事頗明顯，然聯合國勸募救濟兕實工作，在捐輪者與受捐輪者之間，決無區分，全體人民均認議其對下一代之責任，故請彼等各盡所能，慷慨解囊，募得基金，然後根據需求，如何于以分配。</p>
<p>余自成功湖聯合國機構前來，將在派設立聯合國勸募救濟兒童基金委會遠東區總辦事處，俾代表成功湖總會，與中國，邊羅，印度，巴華斯坦，菲律實，澳大利亞，與紐西閘各國響應勸募之委會取得聯絡，此次余來南京之任務，即在籌劃此項勸募救濟兒童工作之中國委會之設立。」</p>
<p>何氏希望以「貢獻一日」方式，推動勸募運動，人人貢獻一日所得之金綫，或所有之勞力與時間，聚腋成裘，收效必宏。渠解釋仍在中印等貧窮國家進行動募工作之原因，乃爲使各國仍有餘力之個人，各盡其能，而後合理分配，以示負擔公平，並強調此項勸募運動及救濟工作之推行，可因兒童之廣泛受益，促使聯合國織構爲衆所週知，且發生感情，進而熱烈支持永久之世界和平，乃可有望。</p>
<p>何氏午後曾與社會部谷部長及其他高級官員晤談，彼等均願全力支持協助純民間團體組成中國委會，渠並於會末報吿聯合國國際兒童緊急救濟基金早於前年設立，然因款額數少，工作開展不易，故發勸此次全球性之普遍勸募，募得款項雖由總會分配，但經募各國於繳款時，得聲明保留優先配得權利，一包括美金三百五十萬元之對華兒童緊急救濟計劃，已在討論之中；救濟物品大部爲食物，以奶粉及魚肝油爲主。</p>

<h3>賡續討論對德和約程序　四强意見漸接近　馬卿週五應蘇外長邀宴</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦一日電〕四外長今晚之第六次會議，討論對德和約之程序問題，已在其三點中獲得較莫斯科會議中更爲按近之協議，但並非實際之決議。今晚所討論之問題，係涉及　和會中之表決程序；　和約將如何簽訂，並將由何國簽訂；　和約與德國憲法間之關係。會議係由蘇外長莫洛托夫主席。關於第一點，馬歇爾建議四外長草擬對德和約最後內容之時，應根據「在和會中經三分之二多數所支持之建議」，並應對在和會經普通多數所支持之建織加以考慮。皮杜爾在原則上接受馬卿之建議，但須視和會實際組成方面之協議而定。莫洛托夫在附加修正條件下，亦表示接受，其條件係爲和約最後內容不應體格根據「在和會中經三分之二多數所支持之建議」。貝文則表示保留熊度，此問題將於明日再度討論。關於訂立對德和約問題，英蘇兩外長提出聯合建議，主張「對德和約應由適宜於接受和約之德國政府簽署。」馬歇爾表示接受，但皮杜爾則保留態度。關於對德和約是否應列入將來德國憲法內一問題，美英法一方與蘇聯意見有甚大之差異。爲歇爾及皮杜爾提出聯合建議，主張「德國憲法中應包有一條款，規定在憲法下所有之權力，應根據及依從各盟國間所經同意之和平解決方案」。此建議獲得員文之接受，但遭莫洛托夫之強力反對。莫氏稱，此項條款如列入德國憲法中，似將有使德國變爲殖民地之危險。渠稱，如有任何一勝利國宣稱德國違犯憲法，該國即可利用此藉口以破壞德國憲法。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾今日接受蘇聯外長莫洛托夫之邀請，將在五日同進午餐，是爲今春莫斯科外長會議以來兩氏直接磋商美蘇問題之初次機會。馬氏希望自宴談獲得何種結果，美代表團方面未予說明。同時，外長會議今晚再度開會，係繼續討論起草對德和約之最佳方法。</p>

<p>阻止各地游資作崇　國行嚴格控制匯款　國家行局庫每週五百億　各商業行莊限匯五千萬　　此次當局為遏止物價漲風，對於金融已有　萬之　置。中央銀行對於匯款，亦已絕對實施控制。據悉：　國家行局庫之匯款，每週　　款項，其總額爲五百億。中國銀行一百二十億，交通一百億，農民八十億，中信，郵匯兩局各七十億，合作金庫六十億。至華北匯款，各行局一庫每週則以二十億為限。　同業匯款，各商業行莊，每週限　五千萬元。此種限制，全在阻止各地游實　集滬上一隅，連動市塲。華北游資，過去多流往華南，但必經滬轉匯。其　至華南以後之作用，即爲　貨物走私，　僑匯逃避。今茲不但商業行莊，予以限制，國家行局庫，亦同時加以規定，整個頭寸之調度上，當蒙受極大不便。頭寸調度既受限制，各地匯款常然減少，商業行莊雖有種種辦法，而其力量終不如國家行局之大。故此次中央銀行此項辦法實行後，匯款已大為減少云。華股起伏靡定臨收買風稍盛　　華股昨以交換情形，國行差進甚微，銀根不若預想之緊，臨收前買風稍盛，由低而回，但中途情况　忽，業中人及有力集團出入互見，有以致之。晨開時形勢平淡，某錢兌業有倒閉訊，開低者多，永紗以即交三五三元，遞交三六〇元開後，八五號等賣出，遞交永紗先低至三五八元，二三五號等來進，回漲到即交三六二元，　交三六六元高價。一三〇號等力售，九八號出即交，逐步下游，中途由一四號等略加吸收而微　，塲外息價開二角二分半及二角七，銀根奇緊，一一七號等賣遞交，九八號等出即交，乃跌至即交三二五元，遞交三四一元低價。外股甚堅，買風易被掀動，經一〇五號等進至三五〇元及三五四元，一四八號等仍拋即交七九號售遞交，午收退爲三四六元及三五一元，除美亞內衣微穩外，餘股咸感疲軟。結果較前收即交股計信和華新閘北新光動興各跌半成，美亞內衣微升，華豐火柴國貨尙平，新華跌一成弱，餘均少挫。遞交股計華豐尙平，永紗信和美亞微降，新光景福勤興各跌半成。　後市夜報載有政會通過管理金融案，但開出却見小穩，七六號等進永紗至三五二元及三五七元，一四八號力售即交，六五號等亦售遞交，而又回小。中途六五號等有納，而有掙扎。一五二號等。再賣而跌至即交三四五元，遞交三四六元，後以國行交換差進甚少，人心一振，八九號等均進遞交，八四號等進即交，逐漸回上至即交三六三元，遞交三六六元。一一七號等脫售，而後以三五二元及三五六元收市，餘股均見穩健，尤以小型熱股所升更多。結果較晨收即交股計景福動興新華景綸升半成，榮豐中紡火柴均平，餘均微升。遞交股一致回漲少許，塲外各老股華成仍堅，舊證交漲一成，餘股榮　咸微統債略見回升　外股止跌轉漲　　公債昨回升少許，惟成交仍僅四百萬，以致市況冷落，起仆有限。統丙晨開一三六〇〇元，高價僅二三〇〇〇元，最後仍在晨初價徘徊，結果較前收計甲乙丁戊各升四〇〇元，統丙漲三〇〇元，五〇〇室有資，五五二室大成興均加吸收。　　外股昨以籌碼乾涸，止跌轉漲，港申電亦退至三元九，買戶漸起活動。怡紗晨開三四〇〇〇〇元，市况在此價內外廣有進退。結果較前收計紙版　業起一成，會德豐業廣英聯各好半成，餘亦微升。食米銷滯趨疲　油市升沉不一　　昨日南北兩市共到米糧二萬零六百餘石，市銷不爽，賡讀趨疲。白粳及早薄稻均見步跌一二萬元，社秈羊秈續挫萬元，客秈平正之狀。白陰元亦挫萬元。麵粉初開尙平，臨收時因北方微有染指，頓形上升，軋挺六七千元。麩皮亦然見升一二千元，豆餅客方有動，形勢站立。黃豆客銷平常，油廠揀短拾取，本街仍淡，客旦略見挫落萬元，杜黃猛削二萬元。　　茶豆交易仍少，尙少正式市價。赤豆豇豆依然乏交，仍未做開。蠶豆零化閒散，步跌萬元。生仁平平，芝蔴油廠　殺，天津停辦，狂跌三五萬元，黑蔴亦挫三四萬元。紅糧一　不振，再低萬元。苞米續見回挫萬元。　　油市升沉不一，豆油挺立，菜油略挺三四萬元，淸油亦無榮辱，生蔴油挺升三五萬元。生油回高三五萬元，吉桶生油午時因甬方問津，猛漲六七萬元，惟小車　油去胃不爽，挫跌三五萬元，大車油彷彿。　　〔本報訊〕據悉：糊食部委托中信局購買之　羅米，現有二干三百噸廿九日遝出。南昌輪二千四百噸亦已裝船，至昌輸興六千二百噸及馬來亞輸四千噸，均將陸續裝載來滬。對日易貨照常進行　出口仍以餘鹽為主　　〔本報訊〕中央信託局易貨處副理楊津生最近在日本接洽中日易貨公畢，已於日前返滬。頃吿記者稱：中日易貨仍係照常進行，關於明年輸日貨品種類，除擬仍以餘　爲主要品外，其他貨物有待隨時商定。進口方面，本局仍本政府方針以輸入工鑛交通急需器材爲主。如本年職入之　木，約計達三百五六十萬根，對於煤電之供應及價格之維持，不無貢獻，其裨益經濟生活之價値，當遠在業務利益之上。關於商品原料，如人造絲仍將繼讀運來，數量多　未克事先預吿，無論供應情形如何，本人希望我廠商多織本國生絲品，關於食糖，台灣產量日增，本年因價格問題，遲遲未獲解決，最近當有解決可能，即可輸出約二萬五千噸，惟係美金現款交易，大荳亦復同此情形售現，鐵砂原擬輸日，現已由　委會另行逕辦，所謂易貨，即係物物交換，不有出口即無進口，倘欲爭取日本出品有益於我工　者，自必須設法將相當之貨品運出，明在易貨之前途要視對日出口之多　，但出口不純為易貨，且有覓取市塲之意義云。食糖升降互見　　迎日糖市因銀根關係，曾步時十餘萬元，昨市稍見回好，但漲跌互見，上落在二三萬元之　。　　買戶活動見低有吸　棉紗布價回升　現棉人心轉穩供求正常　　昨日棉紗市况，因隔日猛跌過鉅，多頭斬殺殆盡，故初開即有見價低收吸，胃口轉健。並聞銀根趨鬆，塲內買戶活躍，貨主扳持，不願出售，中途互有起仆。迨至最後，四十二支藍鳳細紗做高至四千八百萬元，比上日回漲三百萬，其他廿支十六支及卅二·四十支等粗細紗，亦均軋升一百三，四十萬至二百四，五十萬不等。　　昨日棉在市况，最開即有浮空抵補甚殷，市勢盤據，詎至十時半後，聞錢業方面有倒閉之訊，人心又見　怯，交易平庸，行情趨軟。迨至收時，乖低吸收者又起，價再回上。結里十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，比上日回漲自二三萬至六萬五千元，嗶　直貢及漂布，因走勢較健，價亦回秀三四五萬，其餘各布脚地亦已轉堅硬公會劃盤，現貨二四組白一百十七萬元，棧　初爲一百十七萬，後為十五萬五干元·二〇中砂白一百〇九萬元，比前日升一二十萬元，土糖反見　軟，汕靑爲八十八萬元至八十六萬兀，計三百餘包。興化白貨一百十三萬元，　莊一百十萬元。典化赤一百萬元至九十九萬元，計六百餘件。刁靑初為八十萬元，後為八十二萬元，計四百餘件。國家行局停止貸放　機聯會為工廠呼籲　　〔本報訊〕最近政府當局爲遏止物價漲風，飭令國家行問暨省市銀行一律暫停放款。本市機聯會以工貸及承兌押匯，關係國貨生產，特代常國民政府，行政院，經濟部，財政部，中央銀行等有關當局，請早繼續舉辦，原呈略謂：「國家行局暨省市銀行均奉命一律暫行停止放款，實施以來，物價低落，成效漸著，惟工貸爲國家扶植民族工業之主力，使國貨工廠過轉圓滑，增加生產，裨益匪鮮，與一般商人利用貸款從事投機囤積，截然不同。一旦停止貼放，則國貨工廠將無以爲機，崩潰可待矣。又承兌押匯均有利於生產事業，足使原料製品交通流暢，都市農村，經濟流轉，倘若不顧實際，遞予停止，則生產劇减，不但影響工人生活又將刺激物價，實與政府安定物價政策背道而馳，馬會爲擁護國策維持工業起見，敢請鈞座俯察下情，迅即將有關生產之工貸以及承兌押匯早日繼續舉辦，必有助於社會經濟之安定云。買戶活動見低有吸　棉紗布價回升　現棉人心轉穩供求正常　　昨日現棉市况，廠方微有納　，同業逢低有吸，人心轉穩，交易轉入正常，供求尙平，成交一千包左右，又一百担。送廠價做開　　四五四萬七千，沙市四四六萬四千，冲沙四三四萬八千，成交三百包。棧交價做開靈實四四六萬四千，海提尖三五五萬五千，沙市四五八萬八千，漢細四三八萬，順德四二九萬九千，成交七百包，一百担，周浦籽花八六萬。紡建售布　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售布一一九七〇疋，被單一六〇〇條。申購單二八六張，內廠商一四張，購布一一二○疋。布號二七二張，購布一〇八五○疋，被單一六〇〇條。棉紡公會推定小組　研究聯合配銷辦法　　〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會昨下午三時召開臨時會員大會，到代表七十餘人，主席王啓宇，討綸棉紗聯合配銷問題，迄五時散會，各代表發言甚多，綜合各方面意見，計：　棉紗定價，顧及再生產成本，應速硏定物資計算公式，俾生產得以維特。　代紡棉紗，應包括配銷之內，俾得稍能發揮力量。　原棉供應及費金轉週，應予確實保障，以免生產中斷。　全國舉辦，中外廠應一律辦理。上述四點，務求達到目的。最後決講，推定小組，硏究聯合配銷之合理辦法，並準備調査手續，及物資定價公式。人造絲疲弱　交易極淸閒　　人造絲昨呈疲弱，因總廠幫　皆等候配絲，大都在觀望中，以致交易極　。一二〇號一A旭字有光，上午開　喊九千七百萬元，中午降至五百萬元，下牛最後升至七百萬元賣出價，比上日軋小三百萬兀。四A東洋在九千二百萬元左右。　　廠經　　昨市尙稱平穩，交易極為零碎，有單子貨均無做開，喊價　上日相仿。開口貨五担頭八千二百五十萬元有或交，高另担仍喊八千三百萬元，即期價八千萬元有做開。老虎灶絲做價七干九百萬元有期頭。干經普通另擔六千一百萬元有一担交易，特上貨喊價並無變化。　　綢貨　　昨市稍堅，大誠與華強貨眞絲被面。上午開市八百六十萬元有人要，最大到九百〇五萬元，頗有交易，旋略退降。收市做八百八十萬元，下午最大　九百五十萬元，最後做九百十萬元有成交。大誠格子繼縐喊價十二萬元，但乏做開。其他各貨，比上日上午行情，稍形堅硬。　　茶市岑靜　　昨日洋莊茶市，向銷非洲之綠茶，仍因吐納相互擯持，交易　若晨星，市氣則　續站住。他若英商需求不戢之本年度祁門紅茶，晨初猶以執主一味堅特，情勢岑靜如故，迨復一部份散戶　來吐售，乃　有相　做開，惟價格　乏變化，至於內　花色，脫手迄未滯化，致全日經過活絡狀態，多與上日相仿。美國滑物油及鋼軌　取消對華出口限制　　〔本報華盛頓航州訊〕美國自今年第四季起，對於石油產品及多種　　製品，重行實施分國輸出配額制度。據美國官方表示：因該　此等物品供給有限或需要增加，故採用此報辦法，以　量應付木國之需要，同時使各國得到相當之輸入。至於決定此等物品輸出配　之辦法，先由美商部函請各國駐美商務參事填送表格，然後斟酌分配·因此，無論何國，雖有充分之美匯，而其採購數量，須以美國所定之配額爲限。此種物品多與經濟建設有關，我國向須由美輸入，故我政府對此事甚為重視。經濟部已將我國對此兩類物品之需要量訓令駐美商務參事處轉知美商部，唯聞美商部所擬定之配額皆較各國所要求之數量爲少，我國亦復如此。我駐美商務參事劉大鈞與美商部力爭，對於滑物油已取消其配額，而不加限制。金鐵製品中，我國所最需要之鋼軌，亦不在限制之列。美國所定配額暫以今年第四季爲限，聞經濟部正在搜集資料爲要求美方增加明年配額之根據云。自備外匯到埠貨品　審委會擬一律收購　收購價格原則已呈候核定　　〔本報訊〕中信局處理無證自備外匯到埠物品審議委員會，昨午三時舉行第四次會議。由吳局長主席，討諭觀售價格優先承購等事項。茲悉配售價格審議小組由兪經理汝鑫召集將於星期四開會，研究配售價格照起岸價如何加成問題，再交由星期六大會決定。聞紙張，鋼鐵，五金等貨品將被首先決定。該會昨並通過對自備外匯到埠貨品有若干性質特殊物資，仍依照規定，由政府收購。緣若干物品如記賬機等性質特殊係用戶有專門用途向進口商訂購者，銷路甚狹，設此進口商向中售局由請收購而原定戶則因需付二批資金不願購買時甚難應付云。　　又訊，該會昨日討論收購價格及收購後出售等按術間題。決定對進日商申請收購之物資，不間收購後量否有人承購，均予一律收購。其收購價格，昨日亦經商討，聞已原則決定，建議政府，按照市價六折或七折收購，俟政府核定後即可實行。電業法（上接第五版）　　第一百零七條竊盜或毁壊電桿電織變壓器成其他供電設備者，依刑法之規定從重處斷　　第一百零八條有左列行爲之一者，處五年以下有期徒刑拘役或五百元以下罰金：　　　未經　業允許供電而在其供電綫路上私接電綫者。　　　　越所裝電度表或其他計電器私接電綫者。　　　損壊或改變電度表或其他計電器之構造，或用其他方法致電度表及其他計電器失效或不準確者。　　　在電價較低之綫機路上

<p>文學周刊冬晶的鴛鴦菊  朱自淸譯　　代創刊辭　　簇着，小小的髣髴一口氣，不是棵花兒，倒是一羣人；好，像在用心頭較熱的方造他們心頭自己的氣溫，他們活着：不怨　他們的地土，也不怨他們的出世。他們跟大地最是親近的，他們懂得大地怎麼回　；這兒冬天用枯枝的指頭將我們拘入我們的門檻，他們却承受一年最冷流建筑他們的家園在中間。　　編者按：右詩原載倫敦出版之英國現代詩選"Fear　no　more"，未註作者姓名，頗足代表近年英國詩　作風。朱先生譯稿，尤能保持原詩風格音節。今以代作本刋創刋辭，附此誌謝。願望之自滿  王夢鷗　　文學作品是實生活底反映：這句話　看會使人聯想到文學家像攝影鏡箱文學作品如同晒印出來的照像。這種機械的看法，前人說詩，正是如此。自樂記詩序以下，前人叙說詩的由來，總離不了有感於中而形於外，或「氣之動物，物之感人，搖蕩心情，形諸舞詠」等等。其實古人寫文章，多數像店家記流水帳，第一要求通順適口，故極力避免文句上底　扭和思緒上底枝節，縱使說理不淸，也祇好「滑」着下土。而過去的欣賞家們亦多以妙悟爲宗，甚至於說出詩文本有可解的，有不可解的，不可解而强解之，不如不求甚解，於是作者和讀者都在尊重這個「滑」的習慣下，把一句說得不甚淸楚的話語滑來滑去地使用。至於事實如何　　感於中而形於外，這個道理，倘若騐以前人詩作，祇可說是以想像得之。在實際上往往是詩人所形於外的未必即是所感於中的。大抵一種世相映入詩人眼簾，其「中」要經過極複雜而微妙的作用，才開始考慮選取一種以形於外的方式。並且，這作用過程，沒有空間和時間的限量，也可說是物質世界中最神奇的超時空超經騐的作用。因此不但詩人所形於外的未必即是所感於中的，甚至於詩人所感於中的是甲，而形於外的却是乙了。　　不過，在詩作中是否用直接再現的方式，這在前人曾分別詩的賦比興等問題，把這問題說得較為價滿的，如曰：「叙物以言情謂之賦，情物盡也，索物以言情謂之比，情附物也；觸物以起情謂之興，物動情也」。雖然這裏把主觀和客觀兩面說得斜繞不淸，但在詩中以情物並言，即是說無論以任何方式表現的詩，其中不單是物底再現，而是與物相伴存底情的表現，却說得很好。　　在玄學上所謂「情」底含　很廣泛，但大體上可設想爲一種屬於個人的願望底活動。人生於世，關於物質的和非物質底願望，種類甚　；不過就其感動上看，則又似乎不出願望之滿足的感受與願望之　礙的感受二方面。願望滿足的感受之見於詩中者，如感恩頌德之類皆屬之。然而這些作品終敵不過願望受　　而來的作品之多。如生存，健康，溫飽，戀愛，這種種願望受到　礙而需要用聲詩來表　時，除了直接表現爲感舊，悼亡，愁　衰老，和廣泛的戀歌之外，而有時又會轉化成爲另一願望形式，如旅人的鄉愁，遊仙的夢想，事物的寄　等等。構成這種詩作底願再現其所感受底局部事物。如此，與其說這些詩是由感於中而形於外的東西，不如說是受窒礙的願望之自我底解放。前人說悲歌可以當哭，遠望可以當　，主要「哭」底願望，要「歸」底願望之不得遂行而轉化爲悲歌望遠，這倒是這些詩作生成底確解。因願望受窒礙而作自我解放，自我解放不是事實底解放，所以一切都在「當作如此」的情態下表現着。我們看見許多詩人在作品中把自我表現得很崇高，其實就是因他在社會上的地位不及其願望所致。這一點，若使讀他底詩，更騐以其生平事蹟，便發覺相去不遠。前人說：詩，窮而後工；工與不工，是另一問題，但所謂「窮」，亦即個人願望的窒礙，而表現於詩則是可能很多的。若使更由這方面引申之，則又可謂世愈窮而詩作愈富；雖然這些詩作不一定全是愁嘆的篇章，但推其用『情」，考騐其願望背景，可以領會。文學作品反映實生活的意義，似乎可在這裏探究。上工去（木刻）  克萍一寸山河一寸血  葉勁風　　「可是，」年勤務繼續說，他們的手下，都是無風生浪的傢伙們，隨時隨地，都有些亂來，並且一天比一天厲害；暗殺，激鬥，一天要發生幾次；所以……」　　「沒有關係。」鶴見一揮手，把那勤務的話又剪斷了。照鶴見的原意，本是要試試，軍部對他看管的程度，是深還是淺；所以拿步行看夜景的話來探測一下。同時在看夜景的經過上，還想辦一兩件事，打一兩個電話。因這辦招待所和那邊新綠大慶，從鶴見看，都在某種份子監視之下，其中多少有些洩　機　的危險。　　雖知一發見這個靑年勤務乃是「自已人」，那當然用不着再探測下去了。但一聽這靑年提到保護的話，却又把　見的執拗脾氣觸犯了，「爲什麽這等膿包？……走兩步路還需要保護？」所以對這靑年說「沒有關係」。　　「主任，部下沒有接受第二個命令！」靑年說着，又行了一個舉手禮，好像哀求　見依照『〇十二』的佈置辦，又因只接到了這個命令，所以表示堅持地要履得他的職務。礙難通融。　　「沒有關係！」鶴見又重複了一句；「我想你參加『公務』沒有多少時候吧？……可是術語倒是運用得很熟，很够聰明咧。」鶴見一面說着，一面把衣服領結整理了一下，拔步就走。他們談話，字句中都滲用着秘密的術語。　　「部下是新進，三等一級，……」勤務官跟在鶴見身後，邊說邊走：「可是……可是部下沒有接到過別的命令，請…請首長原諒部下！」　　「沒有關係……！」鶴見頭也不回，朝招待所門外跨了出去；「你要是得使，可以打電話吿訴「〇十二」一聲：……再見了！」　　「雒？……　！……」鶴見一到門外，就看見路邊停着一部華麗的路車，車門邊站着一個體裁健壯的小夥十，穿的陸軍服裝，神采飛越，一見鶴見走出，先「閣」的一碰軍靴後跟，冲着鶴見，舉手行軍　，又趕緊一伸手把車門打開了。「嗐，……可不又是「〇八」「野猪」嗎」？鶴見有些又驚又喜似的喃着。因他並沒想到自己的手下，佈置得這般迅速週到。　　可是更奇怪的，是那跑車尾部的座門，己經拉開；似乎除了鶴見和野猪之外，還有第三者同乘似的。　　確然是有一位「第三者」。誰呢？車蓬太低，看不見車中有人。　　還未走近車邊，鶴見早從遮陽玻璃的返影上，瞥見了一變整齊的小腿，一雙豐而不肥，楚楚有緻的足髁，脚上是」雙玄色　面的高跟鞋。歐美化得厲害；普通的日本女性，大概無法辦到道一點。　　「野豬，你把車子開到上野公園門口去等我罷……我想躍　下，散散筋骨」。鶴見搗鬼了。他乍一看見野猪，當然跟看見了親人一般，一肚子的話，和一大綑問題，都預備耍和野猪淸理一下，話個明白。當然把散步的計劃改變了。可是一時發見了那雙歐化的足髁，他猜到那　腿的主人是誰，所以搗鬼了。　　「主任」！野猪滿臉的歡笑，認爲　見眞的不知車中還有一位第三者，正預備像回子獻實似的，把車中有人的話，宣佈出來，好　鶴見吃上一驚，再加上一喜。誰知剛喊得一聲「主任」，下面的話，早被鶴見的警報手式，給攔頭一壓，壓回　子裏去了；連帶那嘻嘻的笑容，都壓的來不及收回；因此變成了一付尷尬面孔，笑意裏面，滲上了幾分牙疼神情。在鄕間  陳家驊　　我們的馮鄉長確乎有點像鄉長的樣子的，突出的前額，掛着一副黑色玳　邊的眼鏡，臉是死板的，沒有笑容，同人家談話時，老是彈着烟灰，低低的回答着「好好」或「是是」。　　馮鄉長的頭髮花白了，　有髭異常長，四十上下的馮鄉長，對這頭髮的變白，却是一種　傲，因而他常常這樣的向人家誇　的：「嘿嘿，麻煩還是其次，自辦理征兵以來，頭髪都弄白了』，自然他還計算着頭髮變白的時間，譬如「本來是一頭黑髮，光澤得很，大約半月以前，接到征兵令後，雙重心事夾攻之下，便全白了。嘿嘿！」　　據說馮鄉長的手段異常圓滑，什麽事請求他，在他均是回答得一定使你滿意的，特別是他的口才，不過事情的結果是否圓滿，那是另一回事。　　我同馮鄉長本來不打什麽交這的、自家多年在外，下鄉去的機會並不多，即是請假回去，也難得有絞長的休息機會。然而這次，因為一家　居的親戚趙老頭再三的拜託，甚至說：『先生，我給你叩頭』這樣的懇求之下，我才同馮鄕長見了兩次面。　　馮鄉長見了我竟異常和氣，從見面起以至我辭退，「先生」「先生」的足足給嚷了五十次以上，眞使我有些不好意思。　　當我提到趙老頭的七百萬罰金似乎過大時，馮鄉長死板的　這才露着一　笑容，他回書齋去拿來一面大算盤，的得的得的算賬給我瞧，自然不外乎因趙老頭的兒子年歲從三十三歲　驅為三十七歲的在鄉公所的一切損失費用。『這是沒有話說的，誰呌騙？，鄉裏有賬，淸淸楚楚，明明白白』。這是馮鄉長對我們爲趙老頭求情的答復。他還說『七日　數目並不大，七百斤花而已」，趙老頭——嘿嘿，三萬斤花儲藏着」。　　對馮鄕長的回答，我早想拆穿他，他的話無理之極，特別是「鄉公所一切損失費用」，更呌可笑，然我忍受着，沒有發作，在鄉間，鄕長就是皇帝，他的話就是法律，對就是對，不對也是對，絕無變更餘地，你只有順從，只有允許，否則麻煩會找上門來，不痛快是不必說的。　　可是自家究在外面跑跑的緣故，不自一般鄉民之馴善，終於我發言了：　　『三萬斤花同騙年歲是兩回事，不能連在一串的，假定他是窮人，議　年歲也得懲罰的』。　　『是呀！先生眞是通明達理，』馮鄉長回答說：『七百斤數目並不大，在鄰鄉動不動就是千萬，絕不短少。』　　『我的意思是罰款須有個標準，不能二百萬三百萬以至七百萬的如此隨便……』緊緊的頂住了他。　　「沒有這回事」馮鄉長急急的回答着：「七百萬數目鐵定的，萬無更動。」　　於是我指出罰三百萬人家的姓氏來了，我說『我不是干涉鄉政，這是鄉公所罰金漫無目標的一個說明·』　　馮鄉長這才無話可說，漲紅了臉。　　我堅特七百萬的數目過大，必須减低一點，我的理由是兵役法規定，非壯丁騙年歲是究辦，三十三歲已非甲級壯丁？，「究辦」，譬如判徒刑一年，以千元折合罰金，也不過三十餘萬，　　但馮鄉長什麼也不依，因爲在他覺得趙老頭是塊肥肉。　　我們正在僵持着的時候，鄉長師母，一個四十上下的大肚子的中年婦人出來了，一個招呼，　　常馮鄉長重回會客室來的時候，已滿臉笑容，剛才的那種緊張的險，完全改變了，他有先說了些抱歉的話，以後便說：『我向他們商量商量，或許有挽救辦法」，這裏的他們，大概指鄉公所裏的職員而言。　　於是我出來了。　　當第二次復去時，馮鄉長允許我減三百萬，他說：『這是先生特別面子，不能公開』，又說：『款得當天繳付，不能再拖』。　　四百萬雖還是個可觀的數目多拿出點寃枉錢。在趙老頭因爲已减少了三百萬，所以當天便賣去了四百斤花皮，把罰金交付付。　　但在我心裏還是覺得很不舒服，因爲法令只規定「究辦」，並沒規定非四百萬不可。　　第二天，我上城，臨行看到趙老頭對我過分感激的樣子，心裏倒也覺得快慰了許多。　　可是等我一回到工作的所在，弟弟的快信也跟着來了，還是的來信：　　『大哥：　　你走後的第二天，馮鄉長派人來找趙老頭，說「上頭」無法通過，四百萬不能了結，須再付三百萬。如延不照付，便得「送志願兵」。大哥的意思怎樣…………？』春天，是永遠的  施濟美　　冬來了，這晦暗寒苦的日子，予人以多少暗然和陰沉；有人將霉萊的名詩來排解這一份憂傷：「冬天來了，春天還會遠嗎？」但是，你不見，那枯枝殘葉，被霜打風吹，那一片灰沉沉的天，接着山，山連着平原，灰沉沉的一片染染得人心也灰沉沉的了。春天，在那兒呢？，　　一個漫遊過南國的朋友，眉目間含了得意的笑容，帶點炫耀的樣子，用那春天似的美而且濃的聲音向我這：『你曾看見過一個永遠的春天麽？』　　一個永遠的春天，我沒有度過，在我過去的歲月裏。但是我却朝她倔强的點了點頭，沒有說什麽，心裏在想一些別的事情。　　她頗有一點兒　　沉靜的思索，大概在想着我並沒有去過四季長春的檀香山，或是熱艷的南洋，暖和溫馨的香島，也許她還稀稀記得我是生長在有風沙大雪的古城，何來一個永遠的春天呢？她準在疑心我撒謊了，我知道。　　然而，我確是看見過的，一個永遠的春天，我眞正的看見——玫瑰終年的開着，在多刺的荆棘叢裏，蜜蜂永遠唱着工作的詩，催耕鳥聲和着晨人的栽秧號，北極星的監絲而穩定的光芒，陌頭的楊枊色，　山不改，絲水長流……　　你不曾因此而動心麼？並且還不單是一個永遠的春天，還是一個最美的春天，因為一切的最眞，最善，就是最美。　　我們該到什麽地方去找尋呢？這一個永遠的春天，「上　碧落下黃泉，兩處茫茫皆不見」，讓我吿訴你——不在地角天涯，不在萬水千山的遠處，只在一念之間，那兒像一個夢的王國，又似躑秘的仙境，有一個從「永無島」來的永不長大的仙童潘彼得，用他的　笛，吹着「春天，是永遠的」曲

<p>自由談顧樹森之畫  趙淸閣　　近來畫展之舉行，幾乎無日間斷。據我所看到的，截至今日止，能超逸不俗者，當推諸抱石與顧樹森兩先生之畫展耳。　　也許這是個人嗜好問題，而不足爲準的淺見，我總覺得繪畫固不可缺彩色，但純粹水墨丹靑，却也別具其典雅的風格，我常這樣想：彩色所表現的境界，意味；是限於浮面的；單調的；不若水墨所表現的境界，意味；無涯；深遠；淸雋；昇華！所以我對水墨丹靑特別偏愛一些。　　樹森先生生專門畫竹積數十年之經驗，有現代鄭板橋之譽。十五年前曾參加歡州巾國畫展。卅二年在重慶舉行過一次個人畫展，頗得好評。勝利後，先生居滬　首作畫，取其精品今日公諸世人，展覽於南京路國貨公司中國藝苑。作品除多數畫竹之外，亦有松。梅，山水。　　先生早年畫竹氣韵磅磗，這次睹其竹輻，宜見剛勁，尤覺淸秀，高逸。無論風竹，晴竹，雨竹，朱竹，均各呈其應有景象，意境。四幅仿元人筆意山水，烟雲生動，意味深厚。用筆之細膩，着墨之暈韵，非常人能及。全部作品除兩輻朱竹外，皆成于水墨，一股幽然氣氛，置吾人於淸雅之鄉，昇華之境。　　先生未嘗習西畫，故其作品爲純粹中國情調，正如其人，只嗜黃龍，不飲白關地然！（卅六年十一月廿八日）我做道士  廣覺　　前幾天上梅的白雲觀三茅宮玉皇山等道院裏的道士，爲了爭經愷收人，在「罷唸」，看了這條新聞，我忽然記起！我也做過幾天小道士的。　　紹興的道士有兩種，一種是職業性的，給人發檄，招魂，拜　，放焰口，還有一種是業餘的好白相性質的；前者都是農民，後者則是老爺，少爺阿宮。他們有點像唱戲的票友，自己置行頭，買樂器，朝夕訓練彈唱做工，每年從九月初一到初九，設壇拜斗；平常也給人家拜斗放焰口，要用禮聘，不收報酬，我家就請敎過他們一次。他們當中，多半是我的父輩，也有我的表兄和畫房裏的同學。　　九天的『斗市』，在鎭上是一年一度的盛事，善男信女從四鄉趕來朝九天玄女娘娘，把他們的寶貝兒子「寄名」給她，同時欣賞那班莊嚴而漂亮的道士。他們所以那樣興高彩烈，至今想不出有什麼經濟作用，我也不相信他們自身對一尊白面唇紅細眉細眼然而泥塑木雕的九天玄女娘娘有多少虔誠的信仰，或者倒正是為了斗　之外明眸金齒如　的游女吧？　　我參加見習的那一年，却還只有十一二歲，並不出於別人的指使，義勇効勞，可以說是純正的「爲藝術而　術」。全身道裝，手秋長柄香爐，　然進壇，把玉皇大天尊元　高上帝有板有眼地高唱着，現在想想滑稽，當時却的確是一本正經十分得意的。　　此外讀書，年復一年，鄉下的「斗市」，似乎不及我少時的熱烈了，打了八年仗，一直不曾回去，回去時才知道設斗　的大寺已經被「日佬」，「和佬」，「游佬」幾次三番燒成了白地，玄女娘娘大概已上了九天，此後再沒有這個感念了。先前那班高雅的道士呢，有的死了，有的生活不如當初的優裕，失去了重揚法器的興致。還有一部份，其中也有我的同窗，則說來大出意表，竟靠這一門，　杭州　　正式做　道士來了。這事情使一位年老的「法師」對我噓唏不已。我想，王孫末路，這倒也是生面別開的。我現在如果失了業，也可以到杭州找他們一同做呆道士去。不要看鐘  孫嘉麟　　課堂裏的學生和寫字間裏的職員常有幾次三番的去看鐘，嫌這針動得擾，出去的時候爲什麽還不到。這是要不得的習慣。　　科學家愛迪生究成許多的大發明都是由辛苦硏究而得，廢寢忘食是常事。有一次有一個剛出學校初進社會的靑年前去請敎他的心得，愛迪生指着掛在硏究室壁上的大時鐘說：「決不看鐘，這是我的忠吿，靑年須第一記着」。　　「不看鐘」誠然是希望成功者應該服　的金言！施蟄存之無相  呂白華　　靑氈故物坐將破，黃絹新編看未灰；繙遍西化轉無相，微吟抗手耐庵來！　　很早在和「文學」他對壨的「現代」月刋主編施蟄存，他的文名確轟動過一時的，直到三年前，我才和他相識。他不但是我理想中的文學家，他那時還編着純翻譯的一種雜誌，但他第一封寫給我的信，却屬於古色有鐘鼎畫的宣紙，一筆銀鈎般的字，六朝畫札式的句子。以後，我就常到他那「暨大宿舍」的高樓，細讀他充滿田園氣息與大自然襟懐的舊體詩，一張張，狹長的詩箋，旁邊印着「無相庵詩箋」五個字。這些詩頗有郁達夫的作風。他對我說有兩重不同的思想，在鄉村裹願意研討古文學之類，而在都市，却一貫的從事於翻譯生活。我兀自神往着「無相庵」的題名，無相是出世的，然而眞出世又豈容易！他看透了多變的世事，還是做着坐破靑氈的老敎授。有鼠來窺閣雜筆記老恭王  禹壽　　楊村彬所作「淸宮外史」劇本，爲對於治史學者之一大揶揄，蓋强引人物以近故事，絕不考證年代，於舊朝體制，更　然無所知，視陽翰笙之「天國春秋」，尤胆大也。　　其中寫恭王奕訢處，最怪謬不經。甲午中日戰事發生以前，即「淸宮外史」上部所指向之故事年代，假定爲光緒十九年，其年，西太后五十九歲，恭王畏其三齡，爲六十二歲。滿淸皇室，視全國爲私產，財富集中一姓，恭王時雖被謫，而私居葆養，非民間衰病之翁所可比。故翁常熟光緒十六年日記，尙有「恭邸神氣淸健，　微自」語，何至如「淸宮外史」所寫之傴僂厥躬，風帽加首，一步一嗽，有如八十以上人乎？　　此猶非極謬，其最荒謬可笑者，則極度誇狀恭王在政寫上之發言權，隱然推爲正義派之領袖。不知恭王自光緒十年被西太后貶斥後，連續十年不能得一差使，此亦可引翁常熟日記爲證。光緒十年九月翁記：「聞醇邸懇請准恭邸豫祝嘏班，太后已允，次日乃傳旨申斥。次年，請派隨扈東陵，亦未許。」十七年十一月記云：「祝恭邸六十　，邀至花園聽戲，一主六客而已。」十八年十一月記云：「奉諭恭親王福字撤下，毋庸黨給。」二十年八月記云：「與李公合請派恭親王差使，太后執意不回，雖不甚怒，而詞氣決絕。」吾人可想象，在甲午戰事將發生時，此翁方憂　畏譏，有如待決之囚，鼠伏描狀之抵厲朝廊，高睨大談，至使權嫗西太后亦爲之變色却步者乎？　　據王湘綺「祺禪故事」：在同治旣立，肅順甫誅之際，恭王以議政王總攬朝事，東西兩太后皆頗信任之。後以創爲「王府門包」，公開受賄，西后反濤焉無所得潤，遂牴牾，時慈安已死，西后乃以懿旨黜之，旨稿有「噯昧不明，實難深述」之語，實則括以四字：「分　不勻」而已。淸社　後，諸王公貴胃，皆漸貧薄，獨恭王一支（歸於其孫溥偉，時號小恭王者也），擁產不變，且加獲焉。溥偉諸子，如毓　毓瞻毓　輩，至今尙爲大　靑島諸地之大地主。而近世談晚淸史事者，猶目爲「賢王」，可發一笑也。逍遙花  陳慎言　　第一章　喜得知音（三）　　肖柏接着這：「到後台御裝的時候，他才慢慢告訴我，「肖柏，某處你是不對路，某處太鬆，我都給你遮掩過去。」我那時不知怎樣感激。梅先生又說：「你第一次和我配戲，關係很大，我在台上，稍爲差一點，人家不注意，你若錯了，便受人批評。我約你配戲，寗願我受點委曲，增加你的身分，所以唱到某處某句，我都給你托過去。」梅先生這種舍己從人，培育後輩的精劉，眞是可敬。我和梅先生合作三天戲，可說一帆風順，天天得了好評，純是梅先生暗巾提携之力。我今天有這一點徵名，全出梅先生之腸！綺紈，你的資質太好，學梅先生的腔調，也很神似，你必須拜他為師，以求眞實工夫。」綺紈連連應道：「是的，是的。」　　肖柏又對梨園界的同業，某人是如何妬忌，某人是如何愛討便宣，某人是如何鄙吝，沒有一人能趕得上梅先生人格，滔滔發了一大篇議論之後，一看腕上手錶，業已十點多鐘，站起來道：「我得回去休息休息。」消齋忙會過茶鈔，和綺紈跟了出去。送到長廊上分手，消齋問綺紈是否回去，綺紈道：「我還得找我妹子呢。」消齋道：「我陪您去找，可以嗎？」綺紈微徽一笑道：「有什麽不可以的！徐先生，你今晚幾點鐘在廣播電台淸唱？」消齋道：「八點鐘。」綺紈道：「我一定要聽的，徐先生住在那裏？」渚齋道：「我離這裏可不近，在後門鼓樓呢。」綺紈道：「我也不算近，在實武門外。校塲二條。」渚齋道：比起來彼此路程差不多遠，一個在北城，一個在南城。」綺紈道：『來這裏不算遠，假如我到徐先生那裏，或是徐先生到我那裏，可够遠了。」說着，向渚齋　了一眼，微微一笑。渚齋道：「就是遠，我也要到府上請敎的。」綺紈道：「請敎不敢當，你能來我却非常歡迎，我們可以對梅先生的咬字工夫，硏究硏究，因爲有許多地方，我也不大明白。」　　渚齋見綺紈說話，竟稱起「我們」，語意十分親密，不由心中狂喜，正要和她多說幾句話，突地由山石後，跑出一個女孩子，喊：「姊姊，我在這裏呢，回去嗎？」接着又走出一個小大姐，渚齋一看二人，便是早上在山坡吊嗓的時候，所見的。那女孩子嘴快，見綺紈和渚齋一塊走，說道：「姊姊，你認得這位先生，又叫我們去俞看，幹什麽？」綺紈不由臉上一紅，輕輕駡道：「別胡說了。」那女孩子道：「可不是嗎？」說着，又往前蹦去，那小大姐也向　齋看了一眼，抿嘴一笑，也追上那女孩子，一同走了。綺紈只在後面喊道，「別走遠，我要回去了。」渚齋問道：「他是你的令妹嗎」綺紈道：「太淘氣了。」渚齋道：「很聰明的，你一門風雅，令兄在梨園界是有名的，您也有名的，將來這位小妹妹也一定是有名了。」二人在長廊上，邊說邊走，到了　門口，渚齋看綺紈各人，上車走了，自己也騎着脚踏車，到國高銀行上班。外國人眼中的中國人  則隱　　一八四六年時，有一個做律師的英國人名（Henry　CharlesSirr者，動手著China　and　Chinese:their　Religion,Chara-cter,Customs,and　Manufactures:the　Evils　arising　fromthe　Opium　Trade　一書，於一八四九年出版問世。據他所說—　　中國民族性特有優點，是做父母的深於情愛，做兒女孝順父母，尊重學問，敬老服治，股勤待人，富於忍耐，勤　逾常。其中孝養父母一點尤見特色。無論貴賤，不問貧富，人人服　孝道。就是為父母賣身的的奴婢，也很多立志積蓄錢以其親。　　照中國法律，親犯國法時子得代受刑罰。法官提不到有罪的人子時，就拘禁其親，以待犯人聞訊之後前來自首。　　無論什麽中國人都　忌不孝，不孝之罪須受嚴刑法峻不過所以如此，或有政治上動機在：深怕不敬生身父母的人民，對於爲民父母的也要藐視。　　說孝的聖賢格言遍貼各處，惟恐孝心之須臾或離。　　倘能一一　奉古聖賢之訓，中國將爲最善之國了。　　然返觀中國國民性之裏面，則中國人實在並不如此。利益是中國人大欲之極點，思考，言語，行爲均無誠意可言，爲得財富，不擇手段。以猜疑之眼看一切，狡猾嫉妬，不知有底。對優於我者態度卑鄙如奴隸然，對不及我者則　暴不遜。無公正施行法律的法官，訴訟人倘非富戶，事件又非須上呈京師俟天子親裁的大案，就無機會受理，得到公正的處置。　　人人沈缅於暦博，話詐乃家常便飯。中國人因雅片而生的罪惡，更不待言。　　　像重慶評話之一「帽兒頭」及其他　白蕪文　高龍生畫　　「過了峽，人說蚊子大如　，過了河，人說蚊子大如鵝！」這四川的　語，猶云以耳代目之不可信。您要是專聽說呀，準保做買賣——年頭舉例當然舉最紅的事，蝕脫「血本」之外，碰巧饒上太太，孩子。　　例如吧，誰都說下遊物價比重慶高、。高多少呢？有的說四五倍，有的說一兩倍，看紙上的「指數」，越看越胡塗，以洋貨——工業品論，百分之九十自下游來，　　不論地位如何，一切中國人都有三個願心：第一，是名埀後世有祭祀不絕的男系子孫；第二是來的錢財為孫子　所享受。是即福祿壽是也。　　中國人這為宿命論者，比土耳其人尤甚。有一個廣東商人某天訪問一個英人，正在吸烟之際，忽報他那滿貯貴重商品的倉庫失火，這個廣東人却泰然自若，燒的讓他燒去，不該燒的還不是不會燒。」這樣的例子不在少數片戰爭之際，英國將士常常目擊，從容赴死者不一。　　不過一方面雖多不可思議的輕生捨身之人，一方面也有但求一命之徒。英軍之侵入都邑者，常見不少人家，大　下列文字：「願獻一切財寶，但求饒命！」繡像重慶評話之一　「帽兒頭」及其他  白蕪文　高龍生畫　　「過了峽，人說蚊子大如　，過了河，人說蚊子大如　！」這四川的　語，猶云以耳代目之不可信。您要是專聽說呀，準保做買賣——頭舉例當然舉最紅的事，　脫「血本」之外，碰巧　上太太，孩子。　　例如吧，　都說下游物價比重慶高，高多少呢？有的說四五倍，有的說一兩倍，看紙上的「指數」，越看越糊塗，以洋貨——工業品論，百分之九十自下游來，運費，拆息，加上利潤，難道也和公用事業似的個個商人獲得有補貼？要不他就眞是有「犧牲血本大减價」救濟川民的　。否則決不會千里辦來的貨賣得比來處還低。　　那末，農產品，土貨總該比下游低了。四川，產米區，今年，四川豐收年，而且爲二十年來所未有；然而米價如何呢？一個月前的重慶，已經每市石三十五萬，或者略低於上海吧，至少和南京報載價格無疑是看齊了。　　四川米價的上漲，決無經濟學上的理路可循。一個研究指數的專家的預測，遠不如我家　人李嫂預言準確：「太太」，她鄭重地表示她的預感，「有票子偕是多印兩斗呦，莫又喊漲　惱火！」她的直覺的警覺性，經驗吿訴我是屢試不爽的，一不聽警吿，不出旬日有「　臍毋及」之悔的。　　然則，米哪里去了呢？根據物以稀爲貴的常識，於是有一個新聞——不是什麽內慕新聞——來說的：重慶第一塊老牌報紙「國民公報」發表的成都通訊：已故某軍閥之夫人，昨午獨赴省府門前，痛駡某要人達半小時之久，謂：「水晶猴子（某綽號），你太不講交情，不看活人面子，難道不看死人面子。你風得幾千噸穀子，我就囤不得！老子絕（駡也）死你　兒子！」以純粹大邑縣的『口語』作三十分鐘「開花」抗議，結果白賠汽油，以二十部十輪卡將抄獲的囤糧還給「該太婆」了事。時在成都搶米風潮不久之後。　　於是，吾儕文化人只好吃「帽兒頭」了；「帽兒頭」者，買不起的「升斗」以下之「小民」，什麼時候弄到錢，立刻到飯舖裏去買回來的熟白飯，兩碗併作一碗，頂平，厥狀略如戴了大禮帽之頭。卑賤的人們常常會爲自己的生活實况找一點小趣味的象徵，北方窮人吃窩頭，美其名曰「手托黃金塔」，上海窮人挨了窩心脚，不也大抵自嘲曰：「吃着一隻外國火腿」麽？社會服務申報主辦晴霞救濟金　　第十七次核准十人十八次即日开始申请　　申报主办之晴　孤寡貧病救濟金，第十七次申請者共十九人其中除手續　合者五人，居住外埠者四人，暫緩辦理處，經調查屬實應即核準者十人，除專函通知外，並列名單如后，希各申請人於接到通知函及所附之收據，仍蓋原有圖章後來館領取。　　姓名　核准金額　姓名　核准金額　　徐金　　五十萬元　　蔡周氏　四十萬元五　　　　　四十萬元　　熊　　　三十萬元　　金泰氏　四十萬元　　徐沈氏　四十萬元　　張子才　三十萬元　　汪金氏　三十萬元讀者信箱　　李卿若君　：尊函恙應請醫師詳加檢　，對症治療，方能　到病除。　　沈　華君　：體重日益减輕，宜就醫檢査，以防肺癆潛伏。鷄蛋營養價値甚高，但生吃亦非甚宜。　　南通溫火盛君　：承詢黃　病愈後如何預防復發一節，經轉詢儲　　醫師，承答如下：「有許多病，能發生　　「病」症狀，請就近向爲你治療的醫院詢問，究竟是那一個病，（參考黃　病文內所舉的病名！）便你發生黃膽症狀，病原確定後，方能談如何預防復發。」　　湖北路二〇三弄全全體居戶　：來函已轉請上海巿選舉事務所核辦。</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Resolves to Prevent Speculation; Four Cities to Establish Financial Management Bureaus; National Economic Council Simultaneously Establishes Supervisory Body</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] After the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau, a financial control supervisory body will be established under the National Economic Council to supervise and assess financial control matters. This decision-making body will increase its mobility in supervisory powers. It is rumored that this body may be headed by He Hao Ruo.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The establishment of the Financial Management Bureau is to meet current needs and is also a decision made by Chairman Chiang after learning of reports from various parties. The case passed by the Executive Yuan today was handled by the Chairman's order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Executive Yuan held its 32nd meeting at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, chaired by President Zhang. The meeting received a report on the refugee relief measures drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs, followed by discussions on proposals, and passed the following two important cases: The Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent speculation and illegal activities by financial institutions in various regions and to stabilize the market, will establish Financial Management Bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou. Its organizational regulations were also passed by the Executive Yuan and will be promulgated and implemented immediately. The regulations for the selection and supplementation of councilors for provincial, municipal, and county councils or temporary councils, and the list of selected councilors to participate in provincial and municipal councils, were passed at today's Executive Yuan meeting and will be submitted to the National Government for promulgation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] In order to prevent the speculative activities of financial institutions in various regions and stabilize the market, the Ministry of Finance's proposal to establish Financial Management Bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou was passed by the Executive Yuan. This new contribution to financial control is indeed an important active measure taken by the government after the economic reform plan. All parties place high hopes on its good results. This reporter recently interviewed Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, to ask for his opinion on this measure. Mr. Xu said: "This type of control method is indeed superior to the previous control methods, because the past controls were only limited to the four banks and two bureaus, or only to the control of the market, with inconsistent steps. This method can achieve the benefit of unification." At the same time, Mr. Xu believes that he has confidence in this and that it will definitely achieve good results, because he has always advocated adopting this method. (News about the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau in Shanghai will be published on page 4)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Arrives in Guangzhou by Plane; Delivers Important Speech; China and Hong Kong to Sign Customs Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 2nd] British Ambassador Sir Sterndale Bennett arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Shantou this morning. He received reporters at 4:00 PM and delivered an important speech, stating briefly: "This trip has taken me through Southern China, Taiwan, Xiamen, and Shantou, and the impressions are excellent, especially the great potential of Taiwan, which is most admirable. Although this trip is a routine matter, it is to promote future trade between China and Britain, so I have paid close attention to the above-mentioned places." Regarding the financial agreement between China and Hong Kong, Ambassador Bennett said: "The China-Hong Kong agreement was already concluded, but it was temporarily postponed due to changes in China's economic measures last month. The Governor of Hong Kong went to Beijing some time ago and reached a satisfactory result with the Chinese financial authorities. In fact, the China-Hong Kong agreement has already been partially implemented. Another customs agreement concerning the fight against smuggling between China and Hong Kong is also being negotiated, but because Hong Kong is a tax-free port, difficulties have arisen during the discussions, so another China-Hong Kong agreement is being drafted to make up for the deficiencies. The customs agreement has now been fully negotiated and will soon be formally signed and announced by myself and the Chinese government. The content is difficult to disclose at this time." (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>Xu Baiyuan Returns to Nanjing; Talks About China-Hong Kong Agreement; Implementation Date Still Pending</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, has recently returned to Nanjing from his inspection of South China.

<p>[Another Dispatch] "The China-Hong Kong Economic Agreement has been signed by both China and Hong Kong." This is what Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, who had just returned to Nanjing from Hong Kong, told reporters. He further stated that the main purpose of this agreement is to attract overseas remittances and eliminate smuggling. As for the principle of the circulation of materials: all our export goods must be imported by the Hong Kong authorities with our export permit, and the goods shipped from Hong Kong to our country must also comply with our country's import regulations. The implementation period of this agreement will be when the black market and official exchange rates of overseas remittances are close.</p>
<h3>Regulations for the Organization of the Materials Supply Bureau Are Formulated</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] The Ministry of National Defense sent a telegram to Beiping yesterday, ordering the Bandit Suppression Headquarters to be established as soon as possible. Fu Zuoyi originally planned to return to Zhang after the Chairman returned to Nanjing, but this did not happen. The Zhangyuan Pacification Headquarters has been closed, and senior cadres have come to Beiping one after another. They are currently looking for a preparation location. The headquarters has decided to set up in the Xincheng District in the western suburbs of Beiping, to be isolated from the bustling city. Fu has ordered that "entry into the city is absolutely forbidden except for official business." Two regiments from Zhangyuan have arrived in Beiping and are going to the Xincheng District to repair the houses themselves. Fu Zuoyi has been in frequent contact with Li Zongren, Xiong Shihui, Sun Tongzhong, and others. Today, he continued to meet with various parties. Li Zongren hosted a banquet at his official residence, inviting Xiong, Fu, and Sun. Xiong Shihui will return to Nanjing in three or two days to report after the Bandit Suppression Headquarters has been established. It is also reported that the "Yanbei Military Region Headquarters" will be established in northern Shanxi, and it is internally decided that Yu Zhenhe, a famous general from Shanxi, will serve as the commander and will still be under the command of Fu Zuoyi nearby. Yu is from Hunyuan. Northern Shanxi is close to the border of Hebei and Chahar. He came to Beiping to pay his respects to Li Zongren and Fu Zuoyi for instructions, and will fly to Datong tomorrow to take office.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Security and Police Affairs Departments of the Hebei Provincial Government will also be merged. All security teams and people's self-defense forces in Hebei Province will be under the unified command of the Security Command.

<p>Government to Make New Decisions on the Control of Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The government will make new decisions on the control of yarn and cloth. The control principles have recently been determined, and the detailed measures will be submitted for approval after being drafted by Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Spinning and Textile Adjustment Committee. The main points of its principles and measures are as follows: (A) The control principle is to thoroughly implement代纺代织(spinning on behalf and weaving on behalf) to achieve the goal of unified sales and unified purchase. (B) Measures: The government will adopt full spinning on behalf to control yarn prices; In order to grasp sufficient raw materials, the government will採(collect) as much as possible domestically and also import 외면(foreign cotton) through the총행(General Administration?) and procurement, and export a part of the yarn of appropriate composition to exchange for foreign cotton. (C) Weaving on behalf will be based on the principle of urgently needed goods. The two major targets for yarn allocation are standard fabrics for daily use by the people and cotton textiles suitable for export. The former is for self-use, and the latter is for earning foreign exchange. The Spinning and Textile Adjustment Committee will strengthen the strict implementation of these measures to achieve the goal.</p>

<h3>The War Situation in Hubei and Anhui Takes a Sharp Turn for the Better; National Army Continues to Recover Luotian; Situation in Anhui Enters Pacification Phase</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 2nd] The situation on the Anhui-Hubei border has taken a sharp turn for the better. After the National Army in the northern sector recovered Lihuang, they continued to recover Sengta Temple and then divided their forces, one route pursuing and suppressing the bandits north towards the Xi River area, and the other route advancing south to recover Luotian on the afternoon of the 2nd. The National Army in the southern sector is also expected to enter Yingshan on the evening of the 2nd. The remnant bandits are fleeing into the mountains in disarray, with some joining the bandits from Fupu and causing disturbances in the Huang'an area. The National Army in Huangpi is currently advancing north to intercept them.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Hankou, 2nd] Military News: More than 10,000 bandit troops gathered and stirred to action in the area north of Huang'an on the 1st, with unclear intentions. The National Army is closely monitoring them. In addition, the 8th Brigade of bandits fleeing southwest from Luotian reached the area south of Macheng on the 1st. Another 3,000-plus scattered bandits fled from south of Huang'an to the mountains near Wangjia River, north of Huangpi, on the 1st.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Army in northern Anhui crossed Niqiuji on the 2nd in pursuit.

The National Army is dividing its forces to encircle them.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Bengbu, 2nd] The military operations to suppress bandits in northern Anhui have entered the pacification phase. A portion of Zhao Huichuan's troops, who withdrew from Sixian, fled to the Fengmiao area north of Lingbi. The pursuing troops and a certain regiment of the National Army from Suining are adopting a strategy of converging attacks. The bandits near Boxian have been cleared. County Magistrate Cao Pushan was dismissed by the Anhui Provincial Government because the Communist bandits impersonated the 57th Division and entered the city last month, and he was unaware that the division's designation had been stolen. The vanguard of the advancing troops in the Taihe area crossed the Sha River and engaged the main force of the Chen bandits between Shenqiu and Linquan.

<h3>Preliminary Procedures for Peace Treaty with Japan; Britain and the United States Are Conducting Discussions; Soviet Proposals Will Be Opposed</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] London, 2nd (Broadcast): According to sources in the British Foreign Office, the United Kingdom and the United States have been discussing the preliminary procedures for a peace treaty with Japan in the past few days. Authoritative sources believe that this indicates that the UK and the US will take a common stance in the discussion of the peace treaty with Japan, opposing the establishment of a veto power for major powers proposed by China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has proposed that the foreign ministers of the four powers convene a meeting in China in January next year to discuss the peace treaty with Japan. The British Foreign Office is currently considering this carefully. Sources in the British Foreign Office predict that the UK will oppose the Soviet proposal, arguing that the purpose of establishing a foreign ministers' meeting is to deal with European issues, and the US will likely take a similar stance. The UK will support the US proposal that the initial consideration of the peace treaty with Japan should be discussed jointly by the eleven member states of the Far East (if Pakistan and Myanmar are included, it should be eleven countries). All legal proposals should be decided by a majority vote, and no veto power should be used. Australia is particularly opposed to the veto power, arguing that all countries in the Far East should have equal speaking rights. Diplomatic observers believe that the Soviet Union's proposal is a bargaining chip in the discussion of the peace treaty with Germany, but the UK and the US are clearly unwilling to mention the Japanese issue before the end of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The First Step to Stabilizing People's Livelihood!</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan held an administrative meeting yesterday to discuss urgent measures to deal with economic chaos. To stabilize finances, suppress prices, and stabilize people's livelihood, it approved the Ministry of Finance's proposal to establish financial management bureaus in the four major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. At a time when people's livelihood is withering and threatened by the "end-of-year price surge," the citizens of Shanghai, upon hearing that the central government has taken such wise measures, will undoubtedly wholeheartedly support and welcome them, and hope that the bureau will be established in Shanghai as soon as possible and thoroughly implement the task of what is currently called "economic suppression of chaos." The organizational regulations of the Financial Management Bureau have not yet been published in full in the newspapers as of the time of writing, but it is understood that the bureau will, under the direction of the Ministry of Finance, handle the inspection, supervision, and reporting of financial institutions in various places. Its responsibilities roughly include the following eight items: Examining and reporting on the lending, investment, and other transactions of national banks, bureaus, treasuries, and their trust departments; Examining and reporting on the lending, remittance, investment, and other transactions of provincial and municipal banks, Chinese and foreign commercial banks, trust companies, insurance companies, credit cooperatives, and their affiliated institutions or other institutions engaged in financial business; Supervising and reporting on the joint reserve committees of the banking industry and clearing houses; Reporting and cracking down on state-owned enterprises that violate the regulations on accepting remittances of public funds; Reporting and cracking down on illegal financial institutions; Reporting and cracking down on the illegal buying and selling of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange; Investigating and reporting on the trends of the financial market; and Other matters entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the mission of the Financial Management Bureau is extremely important, especially in Shanghai, where the financial market is volatile, and the establishment of financial institutions at this time is particularly needed. Our country has endured eight years of arduous resistance against the war, and the economic losses suffered due to the destruction and ravages of the enemy and puppets are more severe than those of any other allied country. Therefore, the national economy and people's livelihood after the war can be said to have reached a state of poverty and exhaustion. Originally, it was hoped that after the great war, there would be a period of rest and recuperation. However, unfortunately, victory did not bring peace. Instead, we saw the Communist bandits raising troops and causing chaos. They either destroy domestic transportation or destroy industrial and agricultural production, causing nationwide transportation blockages, production stagnation, and people unable to make a living, suffering from hunger and cold. Their ultimate goal is nothing more than to use this to promote the economic collapse of the country and facilitate the Communist bandits' seizure of power. The Communist bandits harbor such sinister schemes and tricks, which are not only known to the entire country, but also to the friendly foreign people. At present, during the period of military suppression of chaos, military and political suppression of chaos are certainly the most important. However, the Communist bandits' chaos is ubiquitous. In addition to openly rebelling in the military and political spheres, they also disrupt the market in the economic sphere, attempting to use economic disorder and popular anxiety to enhance their military and political power. Therefore, if we want to suppress chaos, we must get to the root of the problem, find out the source of the chaos, and then prescribe the right medicine to achieve the effect of suppressing the chaos. This is why the call for "economic suppression of chaos" has moved from rhetoric to reality. The establishment of the Financial Management Bureau this time is shouldering this sacred mission. The whole country should have great expectations for the establishment of this new organization. Here are a few of our observations for the authorities to consider. First, the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau aims to suppress chaos, not to create it. Therefore, if there is chaos in the economic sphere, it must be stabilized, and its chaos must never be increased. The bureau's responsibilities, as mentioned above, are purely financial management. Fluctuations in the financial market will inevitably cause prices to fluctuate, which has the greatest impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. If we want to stabilize people's livelihood, we must first stabilize finances and bring them back to normal. But how can we stabilize Shanghai's financial market and calm the storm? Whether in terms of methods or steps, there is a need for careful research. In particular, we must not forget that financial policy must be coordinated with national economic policy. In other words, we must stabilize finances on the one hand, and not stifle industry and commerce on the other. Otherwise, it would be tantamount to abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial. On the surface, it may seem that prices can be suppressed temporarily, but after a certain stage, production will shrink further, and materials will become even scarcer. As a result, industry and commerce will inevitably suffer, and the common people will not feel any relief. On this point, we must ask the Ministry of Finance to pay special attention to whether the policies it implements are in line with the policies of promoting production when setting up this new agency.</p>
<p>Second, the future Financial Management Bureau should be a local financial management agency established in accordance with the organizational regulations passed by yesterday's administrative meeting. Although it is established in four major cities simultaneously, Shanghai is the financial center of the country. Every ripple and wave will affect the country's finances. Therefore, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau is nominally a central agency stationed in the local area to manage finances, but in reality, it has a national character. We hope that every action of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, which is about to be established, can be reasonable and legal. In other words, it must carry out its duties and accomplish its mission within the scope of the law under the national production policy. Those who bear this mission must not be ignorant of the trend of the national situation and the aspirations of the people, and blindly act rashly and seek quick success, so that the effect of stability cannot be seen and the society is already in a state of anxiety.</p>
<p>Third, according to the provisions of the organizational regulations, when the Financial Management Bureau performs its duties, the local government and military agencies should provide practical assistance. If any matters requiring inspection are discovered, the police bureau should be notified at any time. From this, we can understand that after the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau is officially established, the responsibility for managing the financial market will be entirely borne by the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, that is, entirely by the Ministry of Finance. At that time, not only will the responsibilities be clear, but also the powers will be unified. Today, those who talk about administrative efficiency all advocate clear responsibilities and unified powers. Otherwise, they will shirk each other's responsibilities, and nothing will be accomplished. Therefore, after the establishment of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, the municipal government authorities and military and police agencies will only be responsible for "assisting" it in performing its duties.</p>
<p>Finally, we would also like to suggest to the financial authorities that controlling finance is only the first step in stabilizing finance. Can the financial market be stable and can people's livelihood be stable with just this step? This is still a very serious question. As mentioned above, financial policy should be coordinated with economic policy. It is absolutely not enough to rely solely on financial management. The most practical thing is to implement controls on essential goods for people's livelihood and crack down on speculation and hoarding for profit, so that their prices do not fluctuate frequently. In this way, people's livelihood will gradually become stable. Therefore, we hope that the central government can implement management measures for essential goods for people's livelihood after the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau, especially for goods such as yarn and cloth, and food. A reasonable control policy should be implemented first. Since the outbreak of the war, the United Kingdom has implemented a rationing policy for daily necessities, and even today, two years after the victory, the country still implements a rationing system, just like during the war. This is a good example for our country and worth learning from. However, recalling that during the Anti-Japanese War, the government in Chongqing also established management bureaus for daily necessities, such as the Flower Yarn and Cloth Control Bureau, but it seems that they did not achieve any results. However, various management bureaus established during the period of suppressing chaos today must not repeat the mistakes of the past and expose the incompetence and inefficiency of political personnel. Therefore, we advocate that unless we no longer establish any management bureaus, we must pay attention to administrative efficiency and ensure that it carries out its tasks and truly achieves the goal of stabilizing people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Regarding the issue of increasing Sino-British trade, the biggest difficulties at present are the currency system and import issues. Therefore, there has been no progress in Sino-British trade after the war, which he deeply regrets. However, he is optimistic and believes that it will definitely be improved in the future. In the spring of last year, the British government proposed to China to conclude a commercial treaty. In September of the same year, China submitted a corresponding proposal to Britain. The British Embassy forwarded it to the British Ministry of Commerce. However, because Britain was busy negotiating commercial treaties with Western Europe at that time, it was unable to consider and respond immediately. The British side has recently begun to study this, but he could not say when a response could be given. Regarding the issue of inland navigation rights, Ambassador Stevenson denied that he had requested China to open up the proposal. He believes that China's protected navigation rights are a legitimate move, but he believes that in order to increase imports and exports and make profits, China urgently needs to increase free ports in places such as Nanjing and Hankou to facilitate the import of ocean-going ships, communicate the products of central China and the industrial products of foreign countries, and cited the difficulties of exporting eggs from central China and importing gasoline from British merchants as examples to emphasize the necessity of opening up ports. Regarding the issue of British merchants investing in China, according to Stevenson, it is unlikely in the near future before the British economy improves. Regarding the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, he believes that the sooner the better, and believes that the Japanese can only be given a low standard of living to reduce the burden on the Allied countries. When asked about the British attitude towards the Soviet proposal to hold a four-foreign ministers meeting in Beijing, he said that he knew nothing about it. Ambassador Stevenson will stay in Guangzhou for three days before transferring to Hong Kong, and will return to Beijing next Monday. He will give a speech to students in the city tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Stuart Appears Discussing "Freedom"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] US Ambassador Stuart delivered a speech at the alumni association of Yenching University here last night at 8:00 pm, stating that today's world is divided into two fronts, each with its own "ideals", but it can be said to be a distinction between "freedom" and "no freedom." The Ambassador warned that unless the rulers work for the welfare of the people and give them "freedom from want" and "freedom from fear," revolutions will inevitably arise, and such revolutions will only lead to a world without freedom, forming a "dictatorship" or "police state." Stuart said that self-reliance is the key to democracy, and freedom of thought is especially important. Freedom is based on truth. One of today's crises is the concealment of truth and its use for political propaganda. The misuse of propaganda is extremely harmful. It is reported that Stuart is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 23rd for Christmas.</p>
<h3>Iron Sulfide Mine Discovered in Tu Tuo, Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 2nd] Iron sulfide has been discovered in the Huoli Township area of Dangtu County, Anhui Province, for the purpose of smelting sulfur. The Huazhong Mining Bureau of the Resources Commission has begun operations and will supply the sulfur ore to the Yongli Ammonium Fertilizer Plant in Xiejiadian, Liuhe County, to be used as raw material for the manufacture of sulfuric acid. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has designated the iron sulfide mine as a state-owned area and entrusted the Resources Commission to exploit it.</p>
<h3>Anshan Steel Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 2nd] Twenty-five trains of finished and semi-finished steel products from the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, totaling 1,500 tons, were transported from Pan to Huludao and loaded onto ships for sale in Shanghai. This is the first batch of exports after the bandits' sixth offensive.</p>
<h3>Fuxin Coal Storage Transported to Dictionaries; Fushun Coal Production Depressed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Fanyang, 2nd] After the Fuxin-Jinzhou Railway was connected on the 25th, 2,000 tons of stored coal have been shipped out. However, the increase in Fuxin coal production depends on the solution of problems such as power supply, materials, and funds. In addition, the Fushun Coal Mine only produced 30,000 tons of coal in November, with an income of 2.3 billion yuan and an expenditure of 5 billion yuan. Due to the lack of electricity, the water in the mine is getting deeper and deeper, which can be described as full of worries.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 2nd] It is reported that the National Army plans to recover the Yingchengzi Coal Mine within days to supply coal to Jilin and Changchun. The Resources Commission has made preparations for receiving and resuming production.</p>
<h3>Severe Power Shortage in Northeast; Changchun Experiences Another Power Outage</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 2nd] The power shortage in the Northeast is still serious. The newspapers in Fanyang were published at noon yesterday due to power relations. The No. 5 motor in Fushun will not be repaired until the middle of the month, which can increase power generation by 15,000 kilowatts, and the power supply situation can be improved. Changchun experienced another power outage on the 29th. The Changfa Power Plant needs 100 tons of coal per day, and it is impossible to replace coal with bean cakes. According to Guo Keti, director of the Northeast Power Bureau, the current situation cannot be maintained unless measures are taken to increase the power supply. He is trying to install thermal power generation equipment, but the fundamental solution is to open up the hydropower source. It is especially necessary to open up the route between Jilin and Changchun. It is also reported that the authorities have decided to do their best to save electricity in order to maintain power for production.

<h3>Three Resources Committee Paper Mills Actively Planning to Increase Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The government believes that paper is a daily necessity, and its relationship with the development of news and cultural undertakings is particularly important, and is now strengthening the increase in paper production. It is reported that the three paper mills in the Northeast, North China, and Taiwan taken over by the Resources Committee after the victory have been actively resuming work and production in order to gradually supply domestic needs, but because the required foreign raw materials and materials are not easy to purchase, production has not been able to increase rapidly and in large quantities. In view of the urgent need for paper in the country and the urgent expectations of the news and cultural circles, the Resources Committee convened the responsible persons of the Liaoning, Taiwan, and Tianjin paper mills in Beijing in the middle of last month to review the production plan for the 37th year and plan how to increase production. Now this method has been generally decided. If the necessary foreign exchange can be obtained as soon as possible, the paper mills under the Resources Committee can increase the production of various types of paper by 20,000 metric tons in the 37th year, plus the original production of 11,000 metric tons, for a total of 31,000 metric tons, which is worth approximately US$11 million, of which approximately 24% must be used to purchase foreign materials, so the actual savings can be more than US$9 million.</p>

<h3>Representative of the United Nations Appeal for Children Fund for the Far East, Mr. He Cibo, Issues Statement, Negotiating Establishment of Chinese Committee in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 2nd] Mr. He Cibo, the representative of the United Nations Appeal for Children Fund (UNACF) for the Far East, arrived in China from the United States a few days ago. On the 2nd, he arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai and met with Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs. In the afternoon, he held a press conference introduced by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan. He issued a statement saying:</p>
<p>"The United Nations Appeal for Children work is a global movement for automatic donations to help the world's poor children. This fundraising movement has been approved by the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. Under the leadership of the United Nations, each country will automatically organize a fundraising committee representing the people themselves to promote fundraising. Therefore, the United Nations Appeal for Children is a unique development of international organizational work. Individuals from all countries can directly participate in a formal international plan through this, which is a historical initiative. Personal donations or goodwill contributions to the United Nations Appeal for Children establish a private relationship with the United Nations, and this personal action is to address the most pressing and fundamental problems the world is facing, namely the welfare of the next generation, which is actually the survival of the next generation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the United Nations Appeal for Children's work is also a great action to unite people. People from all countries, regardless of the amount of donations, are equal participants. It is quite obvious that the people of some countries with urgent needs themselves cannot donate as much as the people of countries with better circumstances. However, the United Nations Appeal for Children's relief work does not differentiate between donors and recipients. All people recognize their responsibility to the next generation, so please do your best to contribute generously. The funds raised will then be distributed according to needs.</p>
<p>I came from the UN headquarters at Success Lake and will set up a regional office for the UN Appeal for Children Fund in the Far East to represent the headquarters at Success Lake and liaise with the appeal committees in China, Siam, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. My mission to Nanjing this time is to plan the establishment of the Chinese Committee for this fundraising and relief effort."</p>
<p>Mr. He hopes to promote the fundraising movement by contributing "one day," where everyone contributes one day's income or all their labor and time. Accumulating little by little will surely have a significant effect. He explained the reason for conducting fundraising work in poor countries such as China and India is to enable individuals who still have surplus capacity in various countries to do their best and then distribute it reasonably, to show fairness in the burden. He also emphasized that the promotion of this fundraising movement and relief work can promote the United Nations organization to be well-known and generate feelings because of the widespread benefits to children, and then enthusiastically support permanent world peace, which is promising.</p>
<p>Mr. He met with Minister Gu and other senior officials of the Ministry of Social Affairs in the afternoon. They are all willing to fully support and assist the establishment of a Chinese committee by purely non-governmental organizations. He also reported at the end of the meeting that the United Nations International Children's Emergency Relief Fund was established as early as the year before last, but because the amount of funds was small, it was difficult to develop the work, so this global appeal was launched. Although the funds raised are distributed by the headquarters, each fundraising country can declare its right to retain priority distribution when paying the funds, including a US$3.5 million emergency relief plan for Chinese children, which is under discussion; most of the relief items are food, mainly milk powder and cod liver oil.</p>

<h3>Continuing Discussion on Procedures for Treaty with Germany; Four Powers' Opinions Gradually Converging; Mr. Marshall Invited to Dinner by Soviet Foreign Minister on Friday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 1st] The sixth meeting of the four foreign ministers tonight discussed the procedures for the Treaty with Germany, and has reached closer agreement on three of its points than at the Moscow Conference, but not an actual resolution. The issues discussed tonight involved: 1. Voting procedures at the peace conference; 2. How the treaty will be signed and by which country; 3. The relationship between the treaty and the German constitution. The meeting was chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Regarding the first point, Marshall suggested that when the four foreign ministers draft the final content of the Treaty with Germany, it should be based on "recommendations supported by a two-thirds majority at the peace conference," and consideration should be given to suggestions supported by a simple majority at the peace conference. Bidault accepted Marshall's suggestion in principle, but subject to agreement on the actual composition of the peace conference. Molotov also expressed acceptance with additional amendments, on the condition that the final content of the treaty should not be based on "recommendations supported by a two-thirds majority at the peace conference." Bevin expressed reservations and the issue will be discussed again tomorrow. Regarding the issue of concluding the Treaty with Germany, the British and Soviet foreign ministers jointly proposed that "the Treaty with Germany should be signed by a German government suitable for accepting the treaty." Marshall expressed acceptance, but Bidault reserved his attitude. Regarding the question of whether the Treaty with Germany should be included in the future German constitution, there is a great difference in opinion between the US, UK, and French sides and the Soviet Union. Marshall and Bidault jointly proposed that "the German constitution should include a clause stipulating that all powers under the constitution should be based on and in accordance with the peaceful settlement agreed upon between the allied countries." This suggestion was accepted by Bevin, but strongly opposed by Molotov. Molotov said that if this clause is included in the German constitution, it seems that there will be a risk of turning Germany into a colony. He said that if any victorious country claims that Germany has violated the constitution, that country can use this as an excuse to undermine the German constitution.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] US Secretary of State Marshall accepted an invitation from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today and will have lunch together on the 5th, which is the first opportunity for the two to directly discuss US-Soviet issues since the Moscow foreign ministers' conference this spring. The US delegation did not specify what kind of results Marshall hopes to obtain from the banquet. At the same time, the foreign ministers' meeting will reconvene tonight to continue discussing the best way to draft the Treaty with Germany.</p>
<h3>US Senate Smoothly Passes Emergency Loan Bill for Aid to France, Italy, and Austria; House to Bring Up for Discussion Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 2nd, Radio: Washington dispatch, it is reported that the House is expected to discuss the foreign emergency aid bill passed by the Senate on Thursday, but most Republican members believe the amount is too large.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The Senate passed the $597 million emergency aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria on the 1st by a vote of 83 to 6. Before the vote, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg called for the speedy passage of the bill to inspire the people of Western Europe. The passage of the bill in the Senate marks exactly two weeks since the special session of Congress was convened, and three weeks since Secretary of State Marshall personally presented the winter aid plan to the foreign affairs committees of both houses. Vandenberg's appeal stated: "The value of fire fighting lies in speed. The significance of this bill is not only in dollar aid, but also in the freedom of Western Europe. These countries are struggling to resist fierce pressure, and the maintenance of their morale depends on US aid."</p>
<h3>$60 Million in Aid to China Still Awaiting House Vote</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] The Senate today approved a $597 million emergency aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria by a vote of 83 to 6. It is not yet known how the House will vote on the bill stipulating $60 million in aid to China. The total amount of the emergency foreign aid bill passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee is $590 million. In addition to the $60 million in aid to China, there is a remaining $530 million in aid to France, Italy, and Austria, a reduction of $67 million from what President Truman requested in his message. The President's message did not advocate aiding China at this time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted today to restore $38 million of the $180 million previously decided to reduce in the emergency foreign aid bill, specifying that the entire amount should be used to purchase wheat to help Italy. The $60 million in aid to China in the emergency foreign aid bill remains unchanged, so the amount of the emergency aid bill approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee is $587 million, of which $527 million is for aid to France, Italy, and Austria (a reduction of $70 million from President Truman's original proposal) and $60 million for aid to China. The State Department originally hoped that emergency aid to Europe would be passed by Congress on the 1st, but based on the current situation, it seems that it will have to wait at least a week before it can be fully passed by Congress. House Speaker Martin said today after attending a meeting of House Republican leaders that the emergency aid bill could be approved by the President by the end of next week. The House is expected to begin debating this week and complete action on the bill in the middle of next week. Martin also said: "The Republican leadership meeting did not reach a resolution on the details of the bill, and decided to leave it to the House Foreign Affairs Committee to decide."</p>
<h3>Britain Sells Gold; Domestic Capital Allocation Also Reduced</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The British Treasury recently announced that total gold sales in November amounted to £48 million, and that it purchased $60 million from the International Monetary Fund in the same month.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] The government released a white paper today announcing emergency measures to reduce national investment over the next six months. The most affected areas are the construction of new factories, roads, and airfields. The government's aim is to reduce planned investment by £180 million, so as to transfer manpower and financial resources to other important export industries. Chancellor Cripps originally announced in September this year that the reduction in investment would be £200 million, but it was changed to the previous amount, presumably to take into account the continued construction of houses.</p>
<h3>US Commerce Secretary Harriman Emphasizes Price Controls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Commerce Secretary Harriman told the House Banking and Currency Committee, which is reviewing Truman's anti-inflation bill, that if the United States does not obtain the enforcement control powers requested in the bill, it may later lead to the danger of adopting swift action to universally freeze prices and wages. Harriman also clearly stated that the Truman administration does not intend to restore a large-scale control system and opposes the adoption of any extensive controls unless absolutely necessary. He said: "I believe that at present, only limited controls should be implemented on items that affect the livelihood of ordinary families, such as housing, fuel, food, and clothing, as well as important industrial products." Members of Congress have not yet expressed a reaction to Harriman's warning. They have not shown support for Truman's radical suggestions.</p>
<h3>Human Rights Commission Opens in Geneva</h3>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 2nd] The United Nations Human Rights Commission opened here on the 2nd. US representative Mrs. Roosevelt delivered the opening speech, elaborating on the Declaration of Human Rights of the World, drafted based on the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution. The Philippine delegation was led by Romulo.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Reconvenes to Discuss Anti-Strike Bill; Communist Party Members Obstructing Meeting Have Been Expelled from the Venue</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] The first part of Prime Minister Schuman's anti-strike legislation, which requires authorizing the government to call up 80,000 reservists and, if necessary, serve as police force, was published in the Official Gazette this morning and has become law. The bill authorizes the Minister of the Army to command the reservists, but the first order to use the army should be issued by the Minister of the Interior.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] After sitting in the National Assembly all night, the Communist Party members were no longer present in the venue on the 2nd. Speaker Herriot resolutely ordered helmeted, green-clad guards to clear the council chamber. When the guards first tried to enter the chamber, Communist Party member Gu Dangsha, who was also responsible for administrative affairs of the council, came out to prevent them from entering, saying that this action violated the constitution. The guards re-entered the chamber under orders, broke up the encirclement of the Communist Party member Galat, and carried him out. Communist Party leader Ducos then ordered the remaining Communist Party members to line up and leave the venue behind the guards, thus ending the Communist Party's sit-down strike to prevent the anti-strike bill from passing. The National Assembly reconvened at 3 p.m. to discuss the anti-strike plan. Communist Party members have delayed the meeting for 30 hours in the past two days. They firmly declared on the 2nd that they will continue to prevent the passage of Prime Minister Schuman's plan.</p>
<h3>Two Incidents of Disturbances</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The French National Assembly met for nine hours today, with two incidents of disturbances, but failed to discuss the first article of the government's proposed anti-sabotage bill. During the debate, Pensions Minister Mitterrand shouted to Communist Party leader Thorez: "Enough talk, Thorez, you just returned from vacation, but we haven't had a vacation." Thorez had just returned from travels to Moscow, Warsaw, and Berlin. Communist Party members were furious at Mitterrand's words, pounded the tables, and shouted, forcing the meeting to be interrupted.</p>
<h3>Members of Parliament Brawling with Each Other</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] When the French Senate discussed the bill passed by the National Assembly authorizing the government to call up 80,000 reservists on the 1st, Socialist members and Communist members had a dispute, even brawling with each other. After two hours of heated debate, Communist members accused Prime Minister Schuman (who was also present) of serving as a German officer in 1944 and betraying the Republic. Socialist member Dassault and Communist member Gouyvet even started fighting each other. Members of both parties joined the battle, which was only quelled by police officers after a few minutes.</p>
<h3>Strikes Have Reached a Climax</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] The number of union strikes increased on the 1st, reaching a climax. The Paris subway system was completely shut down due to an electricity strike. Troops in Nancy used tear gas to disperse a demonstration of thousands of striking workers from the Joseph Steel Plant, because they wanted to force the workers of the plant to leave the factory.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Returns Home; Mauville Temporarily Replaces Him During His Absence</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Authoritative sources declared on the 2nd that French Foreign Minister Bidault's hasty departure from the Foreign Ministers' Conference and rush back to Paris was mainly due to de Gaulle's threat that if he was not satisfied with Bidaulte's actions on Germany, he would veto them. Bidault rushed back to his country to find out where he stands. French Foreign Minister Mauville is temporarily taking over Bidault's position at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. No decisions can be reached by the other three foreign ministers during Bidault's absence. Bidault arrived in Le Havre on the morning of the 2nd and immediately returned to Paris by special trip, planning to stay in the French capital for a day. It is reported that de Gaulle plans to publicly criticize and veto any decisions made by Bidault at the London Conference that he cannot agree to. De Gaulle advocates weakening Germany and separating the Ruhr and Rhine regions from Germany.</p>
<h3>US Prepares to Send Military Advisors to Italy, Using Aid to Greece and Turkey as Example; Left-Wing Mayor of Milan to Be Replaced</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Reliable government sources report that the US military authorities have drafted a plan to provide military guidance and assistance to Italy. If the Italian government submits a request and it is approved by the US Congress and the State Department, it can be implemented. Authoritative sources pointed out that there is no legal way to prevent the Italian government from requesting the United States to send a military mission similar to that in Greece and Turkey to serve as advisors to the Italian General Staff. However, the plan to withdraw about 1,000 US military technicians and staff from Italy in mid-December is still underway.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] The Italian government carried out its order to transfer the left-wing mayor of Milan on the 2nd and strengthened security forces. The streets leading to the city hall were reinforced with electric fences to prevent the Communist Party from occupying the city hall for the second time. Milan Communist Party leader Bachida immediately convened an emergency meeting of the Northern Italy Touring Team on the afternoon of the 2nd to decide on "appropriate" steps to oppose the government's decision.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 2nd] The national strike of Italian municipal employees, originally scheduled to begin on the morning of the 2nd, has been canceled because the government agreed to allocate funds to the city government to implement pay increases. The extensive unrest caused by the dismissal of the left-wing mayor in Milan last Friday and this Monday has also been resolved. According to an announcement made by Interior Minister Silva on the night of the 1st, an agreement has been reached with the left-wing mayor Trollo. Trollo agreed to resign on Thursday and be temporarily replaced by the current mayor of Padua, Siloona, until the originally elected mayor, Dora, returns from vacation.</p>
<h3>United Nations to Organize Palestine Committee as Soon as Possible; Plan to Control Jerusalem Under Drafting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 1st] According to a senior United Nations official close to Lie, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations Hu Shize, although scheduled to preside over the secretariat of the Korean Committee, may be reassigned to the more important Palestine Secretariat.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 1st] Opposition to the partition of Palestine and the Middle East countries has led the United Nations organization to step up the establishment of agencies to implement the partition plan. United Nations Secretary-General Lie and other senior officials are scheduled to meet today to select all members and staff of the Palestine Committee, about 60 people.</p>
<p>Of the five countries participating in the committee, only the Czech Republic has nominated Mr. Lisicky as the Czech member of the committee. Lisicky previously served as a member of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine. The United Nations authorities have urged the other four countries, Panama, the Philippines, Denmark, and Bolivia, to nominate candidates as soon as possible. Lie will also consult with the Security Council and the Trusteeship Council on the border issues between the Jewish and Arab states. The headquarters of the Palestine Committee is expected to be located in Jerusalem, which will become an international zone.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 1st] The Trusteeship Council quickly completed its plan for the control of Jerusalem under the United Nations Palestine Partition Plan on the 1st. The Trusteeship Council established a committee to draft the plan in detail. The administration of the city will be under the Trusteeship Council of twelve countries, rather than under the Jewish or Arab state after partition. Iraq may withdraw from the meeting, as it, like other Arab countries, has allowed the boycott of all United Nations processes on Palestine.</p>
<h3>Our Representative Liu Kai Attends Trusteeship Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 2nd] The United Nations Trusteeship Council decided yesterday to notify the South African government of the date on which the Council will review the report on Southwest Africa submitted by the South African government, and welcomed the South African government to send a representative to participate in the review. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Cyr pointed out that Southwest Africa is not a trust territory, so although the General Assembly has authorized the Council to review the report on Southwest Africa, it is questionable whether the South African government can be invited to send a representative to attend the review in accordance with the procedures for trust territories. Chinese representative Liu Kai advocated inviting the South African government to send a representative to attend the review in accordance with the procedures for trust territories. After the deliberation, Liu's proposal was eventually passed.</p>

<h3>Intense Arab Resentment: Holy Land Experiences Major Riots; Crowds Strike, Demonstrate, and Protest Partition</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Jerusalem, December 2nd] Arabs throughout Palestine began a three-day strike today to protest the partition. A large-scale riot erupted here today, with several thousand Arabs firing shots in the city, burning shops, overturning cars, and throwing stones at buses. Both Arabs and Jews suffered casualties, but the exact numbers are not yet known. British troops and Palestinian police arrived at the scene in armored vehicles and trucks, quickly set up barricades, and tried to stop the rioters from advancing. Jewish self-defense forces were also mobilized to protect the lives and property of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>According to police estimates, no fewer than five thousand Arabs rushed out of the old city and poured into the Jewish residential area. Encountering military barricades, they turned to Saint Julian Street, one hundred yards from the King David Hotel, and began smashing windows along the way. At least six shops and two Jewish-owned cars were set on fire. Firefighters rushed to put out the flames, while police drove armored vehicles into the crowd and opened fire. A group of Arabs shouted "Despicable Americans" and threw stones at the car carrying the United Press International reporter, but luckily missed.</p>

<p>Cairo</p>
<p>The seven-member Arab League Council is scheduled to meet in Cairo on December 12th to discuss the partition of Palestine. Before officially announcing this, League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha had telephone conversations with the Prime Ministers of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Egypt. Meanwhile, Egyptian students continued to protest and demonstrate. Students from Cairo University marched through the streets under police escort, shouting slogans such as "Down with the United Nations," but no incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Beirut</p>
<p>Ten thousand Lebanese students, carrying Arab flags and banners, demonstrated in front of the United States Information Service and the French embassy, throwing stones at the latter and shouting anti-American slogans.</p>
<p>Amman</p>

<h3>British Army to Retain Gurkha Troops</h3>

<h3>Katayama and Cabinet Members Accused of Complicity in Black Market Activities</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd] On November 29th, Hara Izuru, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Labor-Farmer Party, filed a complaint with the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office, accusing Prime Minister Katayama and seventeen other cabinet members, as well as forty-six prefectural governors, including Tokyo Governor Yasui, of complicity in black market activities. The content of the complaint is as follows: The government's published estimate of actual rice production is far less than the actual harvest. The government knowingly ignored this inaccuracy, which constitutes suspicion of complicity in fraud. Secondly, the government's action is equivalent to tacitly approving farmers' sales on the black market and complicity in violations of the Food Control Law.</p>
<h3>Internal Division in Socialist and Democratic Parties Causes Political Instability in Japan; Difficulty in Selecting Minister of Agriculture; Kitamura Continues as Minister of Transportation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 1st] Tokyo Shimbun stated in an editorial today that the coexistence of the left and right wings within the Socialist Party is the fundamental reason for the current confusion and instability in the Japanese political arena. The newspaper believes that unless a way is found to eliminate the division between the left and right factions within the Socialist Party, the Katayama Cabinet will remain in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>The issues of coal mine nationalization and the appointment of the Minister of Agriculture are merely the initial signs of the crisis caused by the Socialist Party's misguided policy of accommodating the left wing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 1st] Well-informed sources told the Central News Agency reporter this afternoon that the resignation of Japanese Minister of Transportation Komiyaji Gizan was due to an emergency recall by the Democratic Party to strengthen the party's unstable organization. Komiyaji possesses financial and political power within the Democratic Party, sufficient to restrain the party's volatile members.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd] The Cabinet has approved the appointments of Kitamura, recommended by the Democratic Party, as the new Minister of Transportation, and Takeda as Minister of State today. The formal appointment ceremony will be held after the Emperor returns to Tokyo from his inspection tour. It is said that Kitamura Tokutaro is known as the "Minister of Political Connections" in the Socialist Party, originally belonging to the faction of Inukai Ken, and is also very friendly with Suzuki Mosaburo of the left wing. Takeda Gi is a descendant of a wealthy landlord family, but Takeda himself is known as a "people pleaser."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd] The left wing of the Socialist Party held a plenary meeting today, resolving that: "If Prime Minister Katayama's so-called government truly intends to implement socialist policies starting next year, then it is even more necessary for Nomizo to become Minister of Agriculture. Therefore, Nomizo should still be recommended as Minister of Agriculture." With this, the possibility of the left wing compromising on the issue of the Minister of Agriculture is almost hopeless. At the same time, both the Democratic and National Cooperative Parties still insist on disagreeing with Nomizo's appointment as Minister of Agriculture.</p>
<h3>Japan to Increase Trade Ports from Next Year</h3>

<h3>Financial Management Bureau to be Established; Li Lixia Concurrently Appointed as Shanghai Director; National Bank President Returns to Shanghai After Consulting in Beijing; Further Actions to be Discussed Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, December 2nd] The Executive Yuan approved the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau on the 2nd. The appointment of the Shanghai Director was announced by the Ministry of Finance at the same time, with Li Lixia, Director of the Auditing Department of the National Bank, concurrently appointed. Bi Delin, Assistant to the Minister of Finance, will serve as Deputy Director. The Ministry of Finance immediately telegraphed Shanghai, urging Li to take office and quickly establish the bureau.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local Report] President of the Central Bank, Zhang Jia'ao, went to Beijing to consult on the "Emergency Measures for Economic Suppression of Chaos" and other issues. In Beijing, he met with Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and was summoned by Chairman Chiang for detailed instructions. President Zhang returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to Zhang's interview with reporters, the government is determined to curb prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. In the future, more forceful measures will be taken. The detailed methods are still being finalized. The organization, powers, and other details of the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau will be officially announced by the government, he said. Furthermore, Mayor Wu Guozhen and Chief Commander Guan Sitiewu have not yet met with Zhang as of the 2nd. It is rumored that Zhang, Wu, and Guan will meet on the 3rd to discuss further actions. In addition, the Central Bank continued to tighten credit on the 2nd, and prices continued to decline.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Guozhen told reporters yesterday that he had recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, instructing him to inform Chief Commander Guan and President Zhang to immediately discuss all possible measures to rescue the current financial and price crisis. After receiving the order, he prepared a plan, which President Zhang took to Beijing for approval. Because he is only a local leader, and the handling of finance and prices affects the entire country, it must be handled directly by the relevant central government agencies. For example, the handling of gold and US dollars is the responsibility of the two ministries. He is only in an assisting role. Now that the Central Government has decided to establish the Financial Management Bureau, the Municipal Government should do its best to assist in its implementation. As for the Economic Inspection Conference held in this city, because it is to review the effectiveness of implementation and establish detailed rules for implementation, it will continue to be convened according to actual needs in the future, he said. According to a Huadong News Agency report, the Financial Management Bureau could be established within this week.</p>

Yesterday morning, the section announced the following: Since Guohua, Dahua, Dafeng, Tangyiji, and other four cutting paper mills are engaged in the business of cutting paper, they should not store large quantities of paper. They should immediately be ordered to submit detailed reports of the names, occupations, and addresses of their paper storage clients.

Furthermore, Dahua Paper Mill claimed that the stored paper was produced by the factory, and should be exempted from prosecution. Other paper stores such as Yiji Xin, Yichang, Yuanji, and Qianghua have little paper stored and no evidence of hoarding, and should be exempted from prosecution, and their accounts should be returned. Regarding the crackdown on hoarding paper and eliminating the "paper tiger," the section has drafted two measures: The Social Affairs Bureau shall review and approve the restrictions on the quantity of paper stored by paper stores and the registration procedures. Anyone with factual evidence of hoarding paper will be strictly dealt with in accordance with the "Emergency Measures for Combating Hoarding and Speculation of Essential Daily Goods."</p>

<h3>Chang Yarn Factory Workers Implement Slowdown</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central-made winding machines of the Lun Chang Yarn Factory in this city before the war were seized by the Japanese during the war. The machines currently in use are made in Japan, and their production efficiency is much lower than that of British-made machines. Most of the factory's workers are paid by piecework. As a result, working hours are longer than before, while the proportion of wage income is actually lower than before. They demanded that the factory add machines, increase wages, and reduce working hours. Because this was not accepted by the factory, they started implementing a slowdown a few days ago, which is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<h3>Guohua Tobacco Factory Employees Slow Down Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] More than 600 employees of the Guohua Tobacco Factory in West Shanghai have been slowing down work since last Saturday.

The committee also has the power to urgently recommend the convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to consider new developments. China has rarely had close ties with European politics, but after this war, Europe, America, and Asia stand as three pillars, the world is one family, and China is one of the permanent members of the Security Council, so it attaches great importance to the establishment of this committee. The success or failure of the committee is a touchstone for the United Nations' guarantee of collective security, he said. It is heard that the committee has already gathered in Athens. The initial work will be to set up monitoring posts along the border areas of the countries involved, and each country will send observers to patrol the border security at any time. The United States has sent Ambassador-at-large Kirk, a naval admiral, as its representative, and the United Kingdom has also sent former Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, as its representative. Other countries have also sent important envoys to participate. The international community's attention to the future development of the committee is evident.</p>

<h3>Our Delegation to the United Nations Educational Conference Received Courteous Treatment in Mexico; Mexico City Schools Respectfully Name a School "China School"; Hang Liwu Issues a Statement on the Election of the Executive Committee [Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, December 2nd] According to news from the Ministry of Education: Our delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conference in Mexico received courteous treatment from the local government in Mexico City. The Mexico City government, in order to respect China and express its respect, named a school in Mexico City "China School." This type of respect is a first outside of the United States. Our delegation's Secretary-General Ju Nong and Ambassador Feng visited the school, and the staff, students, and locals set off firecrackers and competed to present agricultural products. Also, on Mexico's Revolution Day, the Mexico City government specially awarded medals and certificates to the chief representatives of the countries attending the conference. Secretary-General Qu was also invited to speak to teachers in Mexico City during the conference.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Mexico City, December 1st, Special Dispatch] Hang Liwu, at the United Nations Educational Conference this morning, representing our side, issued a statement expressing great regret regarding the results of the Executive Committee election on November 19, because the Philippine representative nominated by our country, Dr. Alzuona, was not elected as an Executive Committee member. Mr. Hang expressed great admiration for the spirit of the Philippines in accepting the conference resolution. He said: The Philippines is a young country that is enthusiastic and willing to contribute to international understanding and cooperation. We believe that it will be happy to assume its responsibilities. Our chief representative Hang Liwu also stated: He deeply hopes that countries in the Far East will soon obtain more appropriate seats on the Executive Committee, and that women can also participate in the senior committees of UNESCO. Afterwards, representatives from the United States, Brazil, and Uruguay also spoke in succession, all expressing their support for our country's statement.</p>
<h3>Matters to Note for Self-Funded Students Exchanging Foreign Currency [Central News Agency] Before October 29, because the Central Bank had not yet received the "Regulations for Foreign Exchange Settlement for Publicly Funded Self-Funded Students" promulgated by the Executive Yuan on October 24, in order to prevent applicants from suffering losses due to fluctuations in foreign exchange prices, it had notified designated banks that any requests for foreign exchange settlement could first be accommodated according to the approved amount and settled at the market price, and then adjusted after the measures were announced. Since October 29, when the Central Bank received the regulations, it has prepared detailed procedures in accordance with the regulations on self-funded students and notified designated banks to handle them. However, there are several points that relatives of self-funded students or other applicants must pay attention to:</h3>
<p>1. Students who passed the first and second examinations, because the Central Bank has received the list sent by the Ministry of Education, only need to state to the designated bank and ask them to notify the Central Bank of their name and application number, etc., so that they can immediately check and reply directly, without having to ask people to inquire and expedite.</p>
<p>2. Scholarship students approved to study abroad by the Ministry of Education, because the Central Bank has not yet received this list and cannot verify it, must quickly obtain certificates from the Ministry of Education, not only proving that they are self-funded students approved to study abroad, but also proving that they are scholarship students. Without this certificate, even if they ask for help from others, it will not be possible to handle it.</p>
<p>3. According to Article 9 of the regulations, self-funded students who are already abroad, regardless of whether they have passed the examination, must obtain certificates from the school and the consulate, not only proving that they are indeed studying at the school, but also proving whether they have a scholarship and the amount. The Central Bank is deeply concerned that those who have applied several months ago will have to submit them again for review at this time, then the applicant must apply for them from abroad again, which will take months. In order to respond to the urgent needs of students abroad and to avoid losses due to exchange rate fluctuations for some applicants, it has notified the designated banks to first settle the foreign exchange according to the approved amount, but instructed the applicants to submit the above-mentioned certificates. From January next year, all applications must be accompanied by the above-mentioned certificates, otherwise they will not be processed. Therefore, applicants must pay attention to cooperating with the Central Bank, otherwise, difficulties will inevitably arise in the future.</p>

Even with a factor of 5,000, except for Jiangsu, where the culture expenditure reaches more than 18%, the remaining provinces are only less than 10%. According to the constitutional provisions at the time of the implementation of the constitution, the county culture expenditure must reach 35%, which is far from the standard. Therefore, there have been calls from various places to rescue national education.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Winter Relief Association Fund-Raising Committee, to solicit a large amount of donations, previously suggested to the Relief Association to innovatively issue charitable lottery tickets to build one hundred or two hundred houses. After deducting the cost of land and construction, the remaining funds would be used for winter relief. It is proposed that the total value of the lottery tickets issued be NT$100 billion or NT$150 billion, with NT$50 billion allocated for winter relief. The Relief Association has agreed to this proposal in principle and is actively planning its implementation.</p>
<p>Some of the building sites are public land, while others will be provided by real estate developers, purchased by the Relief Association at an agreed price. To this end, real estate developers held a meeting on the 1st, with the Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, also attending. Once the building sites are determined, bank loans will be secured for construction. The lottery tickets will be sold in two types: Type A, priced at NT$200,000 per ticket, and Type B, priced at NT$100,000 per ticket. In the future, the lottery drawing will award winners of Type A tickets a two-story house with a double frontage, valued at NT$1 billion, while winners of Type B tickets will receive a two-story house with a single frontage, valued at NT$500 million. The houses will be fully equipped with modern sanitary facilities and will be exquisitely designed. Mayor Wu stated yesterday that the city government strongly supports this plan, as it can raise funds and solve the housing shortage, a win-win situation. Therefore, the city government will actively pursue it.</p>
<p>Charitable Horse Racing Highly Possible</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of holding charitable horse races, Mayor Wu stated yesterday that it is highly possible. The Jockey Club has expressed its willingness to cooperate, but a considerable amount of preparation time is required, as horses need to be selected and trained before racing. The racecourse currently has some existing racetracks, some of which were leased to the U.S. military. Efforts are underway to reclaim them, and after training, horse racing can be realized. Regarding rumors that the Jockey Club has told the city government that it must agree to long-term horse racing before it will cooperate, Mayor Wu denied this yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaker Donates to Lead the Way</p>
<p>City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, in response to the Winter Relief Fund-Raising campaign, generously donated NT$5 million to show his support. The council has recently received relatively few donations from the press, totaling NT$20 million from the Xinwen Daily, NT$5 million from the Xinye Daily, and NT$4 million from the Fei Bao, all of which have been collected by the collecting bank. The committee chairman, Du Yuesheng, expressed his gratitude for the enthusiastic publicity and donations from the press and will recommend that Mayor Wu present them with certificates of appreciation.</p>
<h3>Guang Xue Hui 60th Anniversary Celebration Scheduled for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Association was established in the fourteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1887), when the Chinese court and people had not yet embraced Western culture. The Association's first General Secretary, Williamson, and his successor, Dr. Timothy Richard, believing that the key to China's strength lay in instilling new ideas, translated, wrote, and published various new books and newspapers in Shanghai. Dr. Richard's "A Comprehensive History of the New West," an eight-volume work, was reprinted many times and remained popular for twenty-five years. The president of the University of Nanking, Dr. Bu Fangji, wrote "A Record of Christ's Life," published in 1896, and reprinted twenty-three times, making it the best-selling biography of Christ in China. In 1892, the Association took over the "Wan Guo Gong Bao," edited by Dr. Allen, changing it from a weekly to a monthly publication. The 24-page newspaper was exquisitely printed, with each issue containing seventy-five pages of commentary, editorials, and introductions to other Western works and historical materials. It was a must-read monthly publication for people at the time. Even the scholars of the Hanlin Academy extracted the essence of the newspaper to compile publications of the Hanlin Academy.</p>
<p>Later, with the successive establishment of publishing houses such as the Commercial Press, the Guang Xue Hui focused on introducing Christian cultural works, such as the Bible Dictionary, the Four Gospels Dictionary, and commentaries on the Old and New Testaments, which were essential reference books for various churches. The Association also collaborated with Nanjing Jinling Theological Seminary and the University of Nanking to publish dozens of books on society, geography, science, biography, stories, music, plays, and children's books, totaling hundreds of publications.</p>
<p>Among the magazines that continued to be published after the war were "Nü Sheng," "Fu You Bao," and "Tong Sheng." "Nü Sheng," founded in the early years of the Republic, was a publication for housewives. "Fu You Bao" was a children's publication, founded in 1915, and has never been suspended, with current sales of over 13,000 copies nationwide. "Tong Sheng" is a quarterly publication that church workers need to consult. In addition, there are plans to revive "Min Xing," a publication for the general public, using a dual-column format of phonetic symbols and Chinese characters, which is very helpful for people who already know basic vocabulary. These publications have excellent editing and are very popular with readers.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the Association moved west with the government, continuing to publish newspapers in Hengyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu, and selling them to the rear to meet the urgent needs of readers. After the victory, it returned to Shanghai for reorganization. Besides the lack of talent and economic resources, it is gradually restoring the work of editing and printing new books. To reach a wider audience, it has established a membership system. Anyone who agrees with the Association's mission can become a member. Starting next year, members who pay a small annual fee of NT$10,000 will receive three major magazines published by the Association and all new books published throughout the year, approximately dozens of volumes, which is a rare opportunity for the reading community. Those who wish to join can write to the Association at 128 Huchiu Road for more information.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Association has published no fewer than a thousand books, making great efforts to introduce the newest ideas and Christian culture. In the future, it will continue to dedicate itself to new books in various disciplines to contribute to the spiritual construction of our country. The Association will hold a celebration for its 60th anniversary at the New Tian'an Church on Suzhou Road at 4:00 PM on Thursday, the 4th of this month.</p>

<h3>Beauty Returns After the War, Seeking to Reclaim Her House; Lawsuit Against Manager of China Textile Company for Rental Dispute Adjourned, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The case in which American beauty, Ms. Xue Fo, sued Wang Tongyuan, manager of China Textile Company, and his brother, Wang Lianyuan (supervisor of China Textile), seeking a judgment to compel them to vacate a garden house at 4, Lane 506, Jianguo Middle Road, was heard in the Civil Division of the District Court yesterday. Judge Lu Pingru adjourned the trial, setting a date for the verdict. The house originally belonged to Ms. Xue Fo. When the Pacific War escalated in September 1942, Ms. Xue was sent to Chongqing to assist the Chinese government in the war effort. She rented the house to Wang Tongtian for a period of one year, expiring on August 31, 1943. Wang requested an extension for two years, which Xue agreed to. At the end of that term in 1945, Wang requested a further six-month extension. Ms. Xue stipulated a new lease was required, but Wang refused.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ms. Xue learned that the U.S. military authorities needed to use the house, so she sent a letter on September 21 of last year urging Wang to vacate the premises, but to no avail. Later, Ms. Xue was ordered to return to the United States to relinquish her military position. During this time, Wang sublet the house to his brother Wang Lianyuan for use. Now, Ms. Xue has returned to China and intends to reclaim the house for her own use. She is suing in court, stating that she served China at the risk of her life, as evidenced by a letter from Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, and requesting the court to order the first defendant, Wang Tongyuan, and the second defendant, Wang Lianyuan, to vacate the premises. She also requests that the defendants bear the costs of the lawsuit and that provisional execution be granted. During the trial yesterday, the defendant Wang Tongyuan was absent, represented by a lawyer. The lawyer denied that Wang had sublet the house, stating that Wang Lianyuan is his younger brother, and he is currently in Hongqiao for medical treatment, so he entrusted his brother with the management of the house. Ms. Xue presented her case and submitted Mr. Wu Tiecheng's letter for review. After arguments by both sides' lawyers, the court set the verdict for the 6th.</p>
<h3>Further Interrogation of Multiple People in UNRRA Case Regarding Flour Milling and Allegations of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The District Attorney's Office yesterday continued its investigation into the case of senior UNRRA officials accused of corruption, interrogating Xi Debing, General Manager of the Flour Company, and Ying Yuanlong, former Chief of the Welfare Section of the General Affairs Department of UNRRA, regarding the milling of wheat and the distribution of items within UNRRA, examining possible fraudulent activities in great detail. The interrogation lasted from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, after which both were ordered to remain on bail. Yesterday, several other important witnesses were also summoned, but all failed to appear, citing various excuses.</p>
<h3>Decided on Detailed Regulations for Transportation of Reparation Goods; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Dispatch Two Ships for Transport</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The meeting of the Committee for Supervising the Transportation of Japanese Reparations and Restitution Goods continued yesterday afternoon from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM. During the meeting, very detailed decisions were made regarding the transportation regulations for the goods. Attendees believed that this point was extremely important, as a breakdown in one area could affect the entire transportation process. The meeting also decided that representatives from relevant agencies would form a liaison committee that would meet weekly, with the first meeting scheduled for next Thursday. Hu Shiyuan, Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, will serve as the Shanghai representative of the Reparations Committee, and Zhou Maobai will serve as the Shanghai representative of the delegation in Japan.</p>
<p>Qin Fen Returns to Nanjing Today After Completing His Official Duties</p>
<p>Qin Fen, Chairman of the Allocation and Transportation Committee, told reporters after the meeting that although the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is scheduled to dispatch the "Haizhe" and "Haikang" vessels to Japan on the 10th of this month to transport goods, due to the lack of trade relations between China and Japan, everything still depends on the Allied Headquarters. It is necessary to wait for their reply telegram before determining the exact date. The first batch of goods to be transported to China will be shipped back after being distributed in Japan. The quality of the machinery is excellent. The warehouses prepared by various agencies in Shanghai were inspected yesterday and are still able to meet the needs, which is extremely important. Otherwise, if the warehouses are unable to accommodate the goods, they will pile up at the docks, which will not only hinder the transportation plan but also damage China's image.</p>
<p>Regulations Established for Preferential Treatment of Manufacturers</p>
<p>Regarding the request from private manufacturers for preferential treatment in the allocation of reparations goods, Mr. Qin stated that the government has now established preferential repayment methods. However, after eight years of bitter war, the people who have suffered losses are not only those in the industrial sector. Reparations goods are the only compensation that Japan can provide to China, so the government must consider the interests of the entire nation when utilizing these goods.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Shanghai Port Improvement Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Port Improvement Committee will hold a meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 AM today.

The meeting will be chaired by Wu Guozhen, concurrent Chairman of the Committee.</p>
<h3>Sentencing in the Qingpu County Fifteen-Life Case, Families Still Dissatisfied</h3>
<p>Zou Baoxian, who served as the head of a township in Qingpu County during the enemy-puppet period, relied on his power to kill fifteen local men and women. After the victory, the families of the deceased sued him in the Shanghai High Court for treason and murder. The High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment. The families of the victims believed that the sentence was too light and that there was no provision for compensation to the families. They repeatedly protested to the District Court, the District Attorney's Office, and the High Court, but to no avail. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, five women and children from the families of the victims, carrying infants, broke into the main traffic artery of the District Court, lying on the ground and wailing loudly. Despite the bailiffs' attempts to intervene, they were ineffective and blocked all vehicles from entering and exiting the District Court until around 12:00 PM, when the bailiffs finally persuaded them to stand up. It is understood that their goal is to obtain compensation to maintain their livelihoods. However, according to the law, the property of traitors must be confiscated, and there is no explicit provision for compensation.</p>
<h3>Deadly Herbal Remedy; Four Temple Clerks Transferred to the District Attorney's Office</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Hou Guoxing, a 46-year-old man from northern Jiangsu, recently fled with his family from the bandit-controlled area of his hometown to Shanghai, settling in a shack on Xietu Road in the Nanshi district. Hou suffered from a cold during the journey, so shortly after arriving in Shanghai, he fell ill with damp fever and typhoid, but had no money to seek medical treatment or take medicine. The day before yesterday, he was introduced by a neighbor to the Tianwang Dashuai Temple on Kangqu Bridge to seek a divine prescription, obtaining ten ingredients, including red [unclear] , raw [unclear] , Longjing tea leaves, poppy flowers, and Buddha's hand citrus. On the way home, he obtained the "divine medicine" from the Liu Yang He Tang Pharmacy, returned home, and took the decoction. By 6:00 PM, he had been summoned to the underworld by "Marshal Wang." The family, believing that the temple clerks had prescribed the medicine recklessly and disregarded human life, reported the matter to the Changshu Police Sub-Bureau for investigation. The police officers were dispatched to the temple for investigation, and immediately detained Zhou Wenlong and Miao Shifa, who were making a living by extorting money, but had no medical knowledge. Liu Shaozhu, the owner of the Liu Yang He Tang Pharmacy, and his partner Shen Dezhen were also arrested for prescribing folk remedies without authorization. The police bureau has charged Zhou and Miao with murder, and Liu and Shen with negligent manslaughter, and transferred them to the District Attorney's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Mishandling of Found Artillery Shell Leads to Explosion, Injuring Six</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Six civilians injured in an explosion were sent to the Dagong Hospital at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Jiangning Road yesterday afternoon. The incident occurred when Ji Yonglin, an eight-year-old child living at 15, Lane 31, Wuding Road, found a small artillery shell, shaped like a water caltrop, in a pile of garbage on Xinza Road and Tokyo Road three days ago. After playing with it for several days, he became curious when returning home yesterday afternoon and used his father's bamboo-weaving knife to forcefully break it open. Unexpectedly, there was a loud explosion, and shrapnel flew in all directions, injuring his father, Ji Rongsheng, his mother, Madam Shao, his neighbors Ji [unclear], Chen [unclear], Ji Zhengzhi, and Ji Yonglin himself, in various parts of their bodies. They were rushed to the hospital by ambulance.</p>
<h3>Fire on Fan Yu Road Destroys Five Straw Sheds</h3>
<p>At 9:50 AM yesterday morning, a large fire broke out in the straw sheds on the vacant lot at the intersection of Fanyu Road and Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai. The fire started when a resident of the vacant lot, where many poor citizens lived in straw sheds, was careless, and the fire spread to neighboring homes. A strong north wind was blowing at the time, quickly turning the fire into a conflagration. The Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade and the Huashan Road Fahua Fire Brigade dispatched vehicles to jointly extinguish the fire. After an hour of burning, the fire was finally extinguished, resulting in the destruction of five straw sheds. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the police bureau.</p>
<h3>Theft at Jiading County Court; No Fingerprints Found on Suitcase, but Slight Mouse Footprints Present</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Jiang Shanchu, the President of the Jiading County District Court, came to Shanghai yesterday afternoon with two empty suitcases to request the City Police Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division to check for fingerprints. He stated that on the evening of the 1st of this month, a judge in the court had 法幣700,000 and a gold watch, which were stored in the suitcase, stolen. Afterwards, the judge suspected two workers in the court of being responsible but did not investigate them. Therefore, he placed the suitcase behind another large suitcase and requested the President to bring it to Shanghai and ask the City Police Bureau to check for fingerprints. At the same time, he attached copies of the fingerprints of all ten fingers of the two suspected workers so that the police bureau could check and compare them after obtaining the fingerprints. However, the results were unexpected. In addition to some slight mouse footprints, no traces were found on the suitcase. After completing the examination of the entire suitcase, President Jiang had no choice but to return with the empty suitcase.</p>
