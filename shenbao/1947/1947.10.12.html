<p>（本報南京十一日電）公敎人員調整待遇辦法，經立院·監院及北平大學敎授分別提出具體意見後，政院以三月一調整之期已屆，頃正就三辦法綜合硏討中。政院會計長陳克文十一日語記者：按照生活指數調整之辦法，自甚合宜，惟在實行時之拔術上，或有所困難，因生活指數不僅各地不同，且一地之月初月終亦不同，故如按半月調整辦法，勢所不能，如是則仍當以分區制行之，且以指數之平均數爲準，此法與現行三月一調整分區辦理悄形，相差不多，政院正就三項辦法詳硏一合理之辦法，俾易實行。又立院提出之調整辦法，於九日已送國府，若干人士均對此有好評·某某監委等認爲此項辦法甚合理，低級公敎人員所加尙不及一倍，高級職員則更少。社部最近亦訂有辦法，與立院之辦法略同，惟基數爲四十元。另悉：政院將提出基數八十四萬及三千倍之加　辦法，且可能於下週二之政務會議中討論，因十一月始必須實行調整也。</p>
<h3>我實際應償付外債　總額近二億　美元美租借物資賬目淸算中</h3>

<p>（聯合社南京十日電）蒲立特主張大規模援助中國，此間政界領袖一致表示歡迎。行政院新聞局長董　光稱；蒲氏之文，極合時宜，且頗具刺激性，必能協助澄淸關於中國之種稱誤解。</p>
<p>（合衆社南京十一日電）國民黨秘書長吳鐵城稱：「所有中國人均歡迎蒲立特有力與深入之建議，如麥克阿瑟將軍能任中國之軍事顧問，則不僅中國·整個遠東均能蒙受其利也。」</p>
<p>（聯合社東京十日電）蒲立特發起，且經國會軍事考察團長柯爾附議，推選麥帥主管十三億五千萬美元援助中國計劃一節，麥帥本人保守絨默，麥帥總部亦無反響。彼二人均會與麥帥長談，但其　果並未宣布。</p>
<p>（合衆社紐約十日電）霍華德系報十日評蒲立特緊急援華之建議稱：「中國爲我人在亞洲最老，最密切與最可靠之朋友，爲此，今日中國已成爲蘇聯之目標，猶如以前之成爲日本之目標，援華之責任與厲害與利害已十分　然，所　者恐將失之過晚耳。」</p>

<h3>政府充份供應物資　挽救物價狂瀾　切盼國民協助共渡經濟難關</h3>
<p>（本報訊）兩週來滬市經濟金融情况，呈空前劇烈之波動全國各重要都市，亦莫不受其影響，國計民生，咸陣嚴重之威脅。記者爲特往訪經濟金融界某首腦，詢以中樞當局，爲應付目前經濟異動，是否將另有新措施？承吿：最近物價之波動，　結在囤購物資心理之普遍形成，故目前救急之計，不尙空言，而在以充份之物資，作週密之供應，以實際工作，打破不信幣制之心理，始可挽救物價之狂瀾。所謂實際工作，即在加緊協助各方面，增加物資之供應。例如食米在此靑黃不接之期，除職業工人之配米外，業與糧部洽撥一部份食米，配售予一般平民。紗布方面，亦已洽定由聯總供花廿萬担，以補原料之不足。凡此種種，咸表示常局正切實工作，步步增加物資之供應，對正常需要，實毋　匱乏。某首腦繼對最近經濟異動之原因加以分析，並謂：今後數月中，我國經濟上或仍不無難關，惟甚望一般國民能開　協助政府，則難關不難沒過。當局目前對已「發財」之企業，決不再錦上添花，而當前主要經濟對策，國仍在如何减輕一般國民所受高物價之痛苦云。</p>

<h3>中共戰略演變的分析</h3>
<p>— 余心</p>
<p>自抗戰勝利迄今，中共軍事戰略的演變，筆者站在一個研究軍事學的觀點來看，認爲可分成三個大的階段：而這三個階段，實在是每下愈况的戰略。在關內，前兩個階段已吿結束。第三個階段則正開始。</p>
<p>從三十四年八月十日，敵人投降的消息傳播出來以後，約莫有三個月的時間，是中共戰略的第一個階段。此一階段的總目標是『抓住突變機會，』『爭取勝利果實，』和『平分天下。』中共此時對自己的力量估計頗高；敵人的驟然投降，又給他精神上以莫大的鼓勵。於是要在受降的過程中。完成華北的全面控制，更進而以華中軍區和華東軍區的力量、威脅武漢和京滬。因此，在戰略上採取全面進攻與局部防守的方式，以圖略取黃河以北的重要戰略據點。第一個目樑是橫亘在晋蒙之問的歸綏；而太行山以東的力量，也都同時對平，津，濟，保四大據點作戰略的調動。所以這時中共向　幹部提出的口號是『勇敢，勇敢，再勇敢！』『前進，前進，再前進！』意思是在政治上要急轉直下；在軍事上耍之氣呵成。</p>
<p>但這一戰略，要以『能攻』爲其先決條件。所以毛澤東一離開重慶，綏包之戰，便大規模的展開，而對平，津，濟，保的包圍，也都同時開始。可是在中共看來，不幸的是：此一戰略的第一個測騐，却無情的失敗了·連接的一貫事實，證明中共的軍力，不僅不能正面進攻，並且因盲攻的重火犧牲，和調動的錯誤，而使全面的軍事部署脫節。於是中共在政治協商邊談邊打的拖延政策掩護之下，來準備他第二階段的戰略。</p>
<p>從三十五年七月起，到今年七月止，是中共戰略的第二個階段。此一階段的總目標是：『守住旣得的地位，』『確立持久戰爭。』並提出『準備十五年長期戰爭』的口號，以穩定內部，等候國際上的大變化。因此，在戰略上便採取局部進攻與全面防守的方式，以圖守住他在勝利時所奪到的一大片地面。再以此爲基點，相機發展。所以這時他向幹部提出的口號是：『反對山頭主義，』『肅淸流寇思想！』意思是上山頭，當流寇，乃不得已的辦法。軍事力量，一定要在若干安穩的空問要，始能發榮滋長。空間的喪失或動搖，歸根結底，也就是戰力的喪失和動搖。這是中共由江西時代所總結的經騐敎訓。</p>
<p>但這一戰略，又要以『能守』爲共先決條件。可是從國軍收複延安，張家口，沂蒙山區，以至蘇北和膠東半島的一述貫事實，蹬明中共並不能守。</p>
<p>中共不僅在軍事上旣進不能攻，復退不能守，且卽在國軍未到之處，如冀中，晋西北，晋東南各他，因中共軍事的過分壓榨，以致社會生產停滯，物資枯竭，人民怨憤動搖，更形成政治上也退無可守的形勢。於是中共便不得不開始他第三階段的戰略。</p>
<p>中共第三階段的戰略，是從今年七月間毛澤東喊出『只有打出去才是辦法』的口號時開始。此一戰略，乃以「流竄」代替攻守的戰略。這是歷史上流寇所走的老路！他的目標是希望以流竄逃避決戰，保存若干實力：同時以流竄破壞社會，從破壞的混亂中，維　自己的生存。現時劉伯承，陳賡，陳毅等部之相繼波河而南，卽係此一戰略的演進。但此一戰略，含有四個矛盾，無法解決。第一，在流竄中，不能對社會完成組織的控制，因之不能培養出新的戰力。第二，拿破崙『軍事的勝利在脚』，但他的『失敗也在脚』；因爲由過度機動而來的兵力消耗，常大於戰鬥的消耗。所以流竄不易保持原有的戰力。第三，以遊擊戰而論，主要依存於民衆組織。中共過去在若干戰鬥中，得到局部便宜的根本原因，或亦卽在此。但在流竄中郤失去了這種條件。第四，由流竄破壞的結果，必激起民衆史大的怨憤，和堅强的自衛力量。闖賊李自成終被殲於少數鄉民之手，乃流寇必然的結果。所以這決不是毛澤東初志所願走的道路，而客觀條件，却不能不逼着他走這條老道路。這條道路，就是他自己所反對的山頭主義流寇思想的道路。只要他在某一地區，自己認爲力量足够時，便會立刻放棄這最後的道路。所以現在關外中共的第六次攻勢，又是他希望在國際支援之下，局部的來恢復第一階段的戰略。因爲毛澤東想到他若全面逼着走第三階段的戰略時，那才是他一個最大的悲劇！</p>

<h3>蒲立特訪華觀感</h3>
<p>— 全文</p>
<p>防止任一國家統治中國而動員其四億五千萬人民來對抗我們，這是最關美國切身利益的事情。</p>
<p>有統治中國之威脅者，祇有日俄兩國。在這二者之中，當任一國家成爲更具危險性的侵略者的時候，美國都曾反對過。目前日本已不成爲强國。但是那繼承着帝俄帝國主義的蘇維埃帝國主義者，利用中共爲蘇維埃强權政治的工其，意欲把中國淪爲蘇聯的附　，不僅中國的領土主權，甚至它的獨立也在危殆之中。爲了美國的自衛，我們必須</p>
<p>採取行動</p>
<p>以防止蘇俄統治中國而動員其人力來對抗我們。</p>
<p>可使中國不讓史太林染指嗎。當然可以的。中國獨立，對於美國有莫大的利益，這種利益，若與我們爲了維持它獨立而所付的代價比較起來，所付的代價實在渺乎其小。</p>
<p>用什麽方法呢？在答復這個間題之前，讓我們先來檢討一下過去二十年的歷史，以及目前的若干情勢，這將有助於我們的答覆上述問題。</p>
<p>蔣主席於一九二八年北伐成功，國民政府的權成遍及全國。自一九二八至一九三七年，其間雖有一九三一年日本的刦奪東北，共黨的擾亂，然而那是進步很大的一個時期。到一九三七年，中國稅收較前增至三倍，國庫收支幾達平衡。落主席發起的新生活遝動，給許多中國人民，尤其是靑年，濯輸了新鮮血富有創造性的理想。共黨　處於　　的陝西，似已毫無力量，許多人認爲中國雖失去了東北，但很快即能恢復國力，臻於經濟健全之境。</p>
<p>蔣主席是睿智的。一九三四年秋，羅斯福總統曾派作者訪問中國，訪問後的報吿，在羅斯福總統的私人檔卷中，至今有案可稽。在疊次長時間的談話之中，蔣主席對於中國及遠東的前途，有所推論，其遠見與睿智，爲歷來政治家所不可及。他</p>
<p>斷言日本</p>
<p>必不讓中國恢復國力，而將再度進攻中國，因爲中國的復與，進行得太順利，太迅速，即可趕上日本。他說日本至遲於一九三七年發動侵華戰事。戰事果於一九三七年爆發。他說戰事將發端於平津之間的眾外小事件。後來果然發生於北平附近的　溝　。他說他將在華北抵抗，然後放棄，他將保衛長江流域，而後放棄，將在滬京漢作戰，而後放棄，結果將首都設於四川的重慶，當時他已投資一億元，在四川的重慶成都等地建立小型兵工廠，他說日本人永遠不能踏進四川，他說他有生之日決不與日本媾和，結果日本必敗。這眞是一九三七至一九四五年的全部歷史。</p>
<p>當時他並且預言日本戰敗之後，如果他還健在，將要面臨畢生最大的困難，國家殘破，人民疲竭，領導中國和平地建設民主的政治，以及把中國古舊文化使之現代化，這是他的志願，然而他覺得比戰敗日本更要困難。</p>
<p>這也是他預見得非常明白的。法國一句諺語說得好：「爲政貴遠見」！蔣主席是有遠見的。</p>
<p>一九四三年十一月，蔣主席會晤羅斯福總統與邱吉爾首相於開羅，會畢發表下列的共同宣言：</p>
<p>「開羅宣言。一九四三年十二月一日。羅斯福總統，與蔣委員長，贊邱吉爾首相。」</p>
<p>「三國之宗旨，在剝奪日本自一九一四年第一次世界大戰開始後，在太平洋上所奪得戰佔領之一切島與，在使日本所竊取於中國之領土，例如東北，台灣，澎湖羣烏等，歸還中</p>
<p>可是十四個月之後，一九四五年二月十一日，羅斯福總統與太林委員長，邱吉爾首相，背了中國，於雅爾達簽訂</p>
<p>秘密協定</p>
<p>這個協定，八東北數省的中國主權，犧牲於蘇維埃帝國主義。美國總統所簽訂的條約，沒有比這個協定更爲不必要，更爲有失體面，更爲貽害的了。因爲常時世界上決無任何因素，足以阻止史太林於最後時機對日宜戰，而我們爲欲使其參戰，使我們盟邦中受了大犧牲，所以此是不必要的。因爲世界上任何巧辯的言飼，都不足以說服頭腦淸醒的人，使他相信我們沒有違背開羅對華的諾言，所以是有失體面的。因爲我們給史太林以統治中國的最有效武器、給遠東未來戰爭開關路途，所以是貽害無窮的。（下接第五版）</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦分治基本原則　美表示決予支持　願於過渡期間協助維持該地區治安　我國盼聯大會審愼處理</h3>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖十一日電〕中國代表蔣廷敝今日宣稱，巾國對於支持巴勒斯坦劃分爲阿猶兩國一節，頗感躊躇。此種舉動在歷史法律及公道方面，殊難證明其爲正當，或將引起武裝衝突。委員會應另行設法覓致爭執兩造，均可接受之解決方案。</p>

<h3>糧食開徵收營業稅加重負担惟市民　商聯等兩團體今日舉行會議　發動全國糧商再請免徵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧食營業稅前經糧商請求免征，中央准予豁免一年，至本年九月底爲止，自十月一日起開征，稅率千分之十五。江，浙，皖，贛四省及京滬二市糧商，為此於七月間會聯　向中央請願免征，爲財政部批駁不准，中華民國商會聯合及中華民國糧食商業同業公會聯合會籌備處，定於今日下午二時，假民國路三七七號開會，商討發動全國各省市商會及糧商推派代表再向中央請顧要求免征。全國商會及糧商商業同業公會聯合會籌備處，於昨晚招待新聞界，報告要求免征糧食營業稅之經過。據上海市米糧同業公會常務理事振華稱：糧食向不抽稅，此在各國皆然，海外運糧來華，進口稅等皆予豁免，尤其在此米價波動糧食問照嚴重時際，抽稅更將發生嚴重影響。目前上海每日食米消耗量爲一萬五千石，如以市價每石八十萬計算，每石抽稅一萬二千元，一天共需納稅一億八千萬元。雜糧每日消耗六千担，以市價每担四十萬計，每担抽稅六元，一天共需納稅三千六百萬元。麫粉每日消耗量爲一萬二千包，出廠時已納貨物稅，如再須繳納糧食營業稅，以市價每袋二十四萬計，每袋抽稅三十六百元，一天共納稅四千三百二十萬元。以上共計二億五千九百二十萬元，即爲上海市每日所應納之糧貧營業稅，此在糧商本身利益無影響，加重負擔者爲升斗市民。且米糧自產地經碾米商，批發商，販運商，經售商，銷地批發商及零售商，輾轉經手，共須繳納六次營業稅，最後均將加於購食之市民，其負担之重，不言可　。目前中央認爲不能豁免之原因有二：　如糧食營業稅可免，其他日用品商亦將繼起請求援例。　糧食營業稅爲地方稅，豁免後影響地方財政。但第一點各業業性質不同，當不致發生援例，可請政府不必顧慮。第二點因地方政府之財政預算，本未將糧食營業稅列入，故豁免後自亦並無影響云云。</p>
<h3>汽油漲價二重原因　最近外匯提高兼又徵收關稅輸管會負責人解釋</h3>
<p>關於汽油加價事，據輸管會汽柴油分配委員會負責人談！油料全係國外輸入，在外匯匯率變更時，勢將隨之變更，否則油公司成本不敷，必致减少供應，前在八月十八日結匯辦法變更後，汽油因需外匯，照市價結匯，其成本約較原定官價，增漲三倍，本會一再與油公司商量，勸其不可增加太驟，各油公司爲顧全油價安定起見，均允不照比例增加。</p>
<p>最近匯率提高，油料輸入成本，確見增高，加以自本月一日起，財政部公布汽油轍入徵收關稅百分之五十，因此二種原因，油公司一再申請加價，本會當考査其實際成本，核實規定，至關稅一項，係屬國家稅收，在戰前本有此項關稅，現收稅率與戰前相埒，而戰前汽油售價，每加侖爲九角至一元，現售二萬五千五百元，以視其他物價，當屬較低。惟汽油輸入消耗國家外匯，最近英國减少汽車，限制個人用油，實爲節省國家外匯不得已之舉，吾國處此艱困之際，深望國人以英國爲法，儘量節用汽油，以减少國家外匯之支出，至調整汽油價格，係輸出入管理委員會職權範圍，與中央銀行無涉。</p>

<h3>加新任大使在滬昨首次招待記者　暢論兩國友好關係</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕加拿大新任駐華大使戴爲世於五月前來華，最近由京初次到滬，昨日上午十一時在華懋飯店首次正式招待記者，發表談話，略謂：「本人在此時担任加駐華大使之職，深感光榮，並亦覺得責任重大。因余認爲此數年乃中國歷史上最重要之一頁。中加兩國相同之處極多，數年來始終友好。此次大戰因中國之英勇抗戰，得以縮短戰爭之時間，而拯救許多同盟國家人民之生命，余深信一切盟國均必感激中國。但吾人對於中國完成抗戰後又遇國內糾紛表示不幸。余希望中國能早日結束戰事，向復典及建國大道邁進。</p>
<p>中加兩國開始貿易還在五十年以前。加拿大之白報紙供給中國者在百分之五十以上。加本國雖生產减少，但仍將供給其他各國市場者减低，而多供應中國。同時對於鐵路枕木，麵粉，木材，開礦工具等，均爲中加貿易要品。而在加拿大物價管制之下，其價格較戰事結柬時所漲甚微。在中國方而，加拿大則需要中國之羊毛以製地毯，　錫以作鋼鐵，猪　以作毛刷，以及胡桃，花生，手工藝出品等。因此余深信兩國互相貿易，其將來貿易當更可增進。</p>
<p>關於對日和約，本國亦極注意，吾人極欲確知日本將永不再施用其侵略政策。</p>
<p>渠並報告，加拿大在戰時，對於亞洲之貢獻，雖未如對歐洲者爲大，但加拿大海軍曾協助美軍在遠東作戰，犧牲亦頗重大。在雖時，加拿大並捐輸盟國物資達二十五億美元，其中供給中國者爲四千萬元，皆由加人民捐稅中抽取。另由加拿大衆辦中國戰時救濟基金委員會，每年捐贈中國現款及物資達數百萬美元。現戰事雖已結束，此委員會則易名「加拿大援華委員會」繼續助華工作。</p>
<p>此外，在聯總方面，加拿大對中國之貢獻列入第三多數。戰爭結束後，加拿大以六千萬美元借款助華復興。加拿大人口僅一千二百萬人，故每一人民均對其捐輸助華引以爲榮。華僑在加拿大現約有四萬人，彼等均勤於工作，並甚節儉，與加人民極爲友善。</p>
<p>戴氏定在滬勾留一週後返京，在滬期間並擬參觀聯總，並與聯總署長魯克斯將軍商討聯總結束後之　。</p>

<h3>蒲立特訪華觀感（上文接第二版）</h3>
<p>雅爾達協定的內容如次：</p>
<p>『對日本所獲之協議：，』蘇美英三國同意在德國投降及歐洲戰事結束兩個月或三個月內，蘇聯當加人盟國方面，共同對日作戰，條件如下：</p>
<p>『　外蒙古應保持其蒙古人民共和國之現狀。</p>
<p>『　日本在一九〇四年所破壞之蘇聯權利，應予恢復：甲，庫頁島南部及其附近各島應歸還蘇聯。乙，大連應闢爲國際商港，保障蘇聯在該地之優越利益，恢復旅順之租貸欋，成爲蘇聯之海軍基地。丙，中東鐵路及南滿鐵道，爲赴大連之交通要道，應建立中蘇合營之公司，由中蘇爾國共管之，並經諒解，蘇聯之優越利益，須予保障，而中國則保持其在東北之全部主權。</p>
<p>『　千島羣島應交給蘇聯。</p>
<p>『關於外蒙古，大連及鐵路等項之協議，當須徵得蔣主席之認可。美總統對此當接受史太林委員長之意見，設法徵得同意。</p>
<p>『强領袖同意蘇方之要求，待擊敗日本後，必須無問題的予以履行。蘇聯對此即希望能與中國國民政府簽訂中蘇友好同盟協定，俾以軍隊援助中國，以解放其受日本之侵佔。一九四五年二月十一日史　林，羅斯福，邱吉爾簽訂於蘇聯之雅爾達。』</p>
<p>協定中之第一條，意即爲謂蘇聯在中國外蒙古地方所建立之</p>
<p>共產國家</p>
<p>將永遠脫中國。</p>
<p>第二條，即係對於一九〇〇年拳亂以後，俄國用殘暴武力在東北所獲之「權利」，加以承認。美國政府一向否認其有效性而爲我「門戶開放政策」所排斥的所謂「權利」，由是變成合法，這蔑葉了海約翰及老羅斯福的政策。</p>
<p>第二條的乙丙二項，不僅使蘇聯在東北重要港口大連獲得『優越權利』，及完全控制旅順的海軍根據地，且將自蘇聯通達大連的鐵路，給其以優越權利，將東北省西北面到南面劃成兩半。</p>
<p>此舉有如美國的盟邦，秘密與蘇聯成立協定，使蘇聯在紐約城獲得「優越權利」，完全控制保衛該城的軍港，且將大湖區通至紐約城之中央鐵路的「優越權利」也給了它。在這種情形之下，雖有人一本正經地吿訴我們，我們在紐約州仍有完全主權，但是我們一定奇怪履行這諾言的方法，實在有些不可思議。在紅軍</p>
<p>刦奪東北</p>
<p>約值二十億美元工業設備而飽載以去之前，東北的工業，占全中國的百分之七十。其對中國之重要性，不下於紐約州之對於美國。中國人覺得，我們履行開羅諾言的方法，實在太奇怪了。</p>
<p>而第二條以後的兩節文字，更是含有惡毒的矛盾，在前一節中，羅斯福總統對於蘇聯之欲染指於東北心臟，同意設法徵得蔣主席之認可，而在第二節中，三強同意蘇方之耍求，『必須無問題的予以履行』，易言之，不論中國之同意與否，皆須執行，這種條款，直接損害了目一九三七年肌開始抗日的忠賞盟邦中國，其可笑與卑鄙爲美國外交史上空前所未有。</p>
<p>凡是美國人都知道，我們參加第二次世界大戰之後，羅斯福總統的外交政策，及其實現世界和平的期望，建基於一種空想，　以爲他能使史太林的蘇維埃帝國主義轉變爲民主合作。羅總統雖於一九四〇年二月十日會經過：「凡是有勇氣面對實施的人，都知道蘇聯是在</p>
<p>獨裁統治</p>
<p>之下，其絕對性，無殊於世「界上任無獨裁國家」，然而他在國際正式的交往上，却把蘇聯視爲「愛好和平的民主國家」，好像稱老虎爲羔羊，老虎就爲變成羔羊似的。老虎並沒有變成羔羊，它侵吞了半僩歐洲，且向中國及朝鮮伸爪。在一九四七年二月十二日杜魯門總統發表其演說之前，美國政府一直採取着可笑態度，把蘇聯視爲愛好和平的民主國家，而中國共產黨，祇是土地改革者，並不聽命於莫斯科。這個觀點，造成了我們在遠東的一連串怪異行動。（明日發刋）</p>

<h3>八個研究所·十八年工作　平研院紀念會報告</h3>
<p>— 李書華</p>
<p>今天本院舉行十八週年紀念會。我們不願擴大舉行，不敢勞動各方面，所以事先沒有通知各方面。本來本院十八週年紀念日是本年九月九日，當時因爲來不及，泆定延期一個月舉行。今天是十月九日，是國慶日的先一天。所以今天舉行十八週年紀念會，同時也有預行慶祝國慶的意義。</p>
<p>本院是民國十七年十一月開始籌備，民國十八年九月九日正式成立，戰至本年九月九日已滿十八週年了。本院現設有總辦事處及物理學，　學，化學，藥物，生理學，動物學，植物學，史學八個硏究所。又本院與國立西北盤學院合組中國西北植物調査所。在抗戰前本院設有地質學硏究所，係與實業部地質調査所合作全由翁詠霓先生主持。抗戰軍興，本院經費困難，翁先生主張：「經費暫停，關係仍舊。」技師地質學研究經費暫停，但是發調查所得關係仍舊。</p>
<p>從安定　到動盪</p>
<p>從民國十八年本院成</p>
<p>從民國十八年本院成立到民國二十六年是安定時期，本院各研究所在這個時期完全注重研究　的硏究工作，雖然時常在野外調査，採集，或發掘，然而總是爲研究室的工作找材料。在這個時期本院同人在學術方面</p>
<p>從民國二十六年到現在，這十年的工作，是遷移工作，抗戰時期的工作，復員工作，同復員後恢復原有的工作。七七事變以前本院先將　學藥物兩硏究所遷往上海，植物學硏究所遷往陝西武功。遷出各部分仍照常工作。平津淪陷以後，本院在北平的各項工作停頓。本院總辦事處及物理，化學，生理，動物，史學各研究所遷往昆明。並將重要的圖書儀器藥品，在北平淪陷以後，由北平搶運出去，經過天津上海香港海防遝到昆明。我們在昆能够工作八年多，全是靠着這批搶運的圖書儀器藥品。這種搶運實在是一種奇蹟！稍遲在上海的鐳學與藥物兩研究所亦遷往昆明。植物學硏究所也有一部分遷昆。本院抗戰時期的工作，除了研究室的工作以外，特別注重應用方面的研究，同時注意有學術性質或有經濟價値的調査與研究。</p>
<p>從勝利　到復員</p>
<p>日本投降以後，本院派錢臨照及蘇秉琦兩先生到北平接受。本院各部分於三十五年陸續復員。本院在北年原有房屋曾爲敵偽佔據，接收時損壞甚多，經已陸續修復。本院留平圖書儀器傢具損壞及遺失甚多。所幸第一批圖書儀器二百四十七箱由昆明經長沙，漢口，上海，天津於三十六年一月二十七日運抵北平，各研究所得以恢復大部分工作。現在第二批圖　儀器藥品一百六千二箱已經由昆明運到上海，不久便可運回北平。此外存在西北的圖書標本，存在上海的圖書儀器，還有約六七百箱之多，一時無力全部遝回。復員時本院購買民房兩所，用作職員宿舍。購置此項宿舍，蘇乘琦先生出力最多。（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市雖有存紗登記之利　消息，而行情依然瘋狂疾升，蓋因外埠紗價報高，津漢等帮進意濃郁，本街染織廠以布價高翔，添辦原料，胃口甚健。兼以新買參加，市勢力飛黃騰達。最後四二支紗比假前劇漲五百四十萬元之鉅。又創二千五百萬之新高峯，廿支特變馬上翔二百二十萬，輕變馬漲二百廿四萬，十六支光明升二百廿六萬，其他各支粗細紗價亦一致翔翔二百餘萬至二百萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉布市况：初開明平暗堅，旋因各地實銷甚暢，更以業外進提，紡建以低檔細布開售，且掛牌價格提高甚鉅，而種類不多。十二磅龍頭細布久未供應，民營染廠及布廠因工料加貴，開售亦稀，致各布行情一致疾升。最後結果，各檔細布比假前上升三五六萬元，嗶嘰猛漲六七萬至十五萬五千，士林布亦升十萬至十五萬，其餘漂粗布及色布一致均創新高峯。</p>

<p>現棉上漲</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况堅挺，價格再趨上揚，同業以紗布劇漲，人心高昂，吸胃濃厚，紗廠因花價過高，進意淡薄，故交易不旺，且成交頗多零星。靈實最高價爲四四六萬，較前日升十五萬，火機挺二〇萬，其餘各檔亦跟升十萬左右。棧交價做開靈實四三五萬至四四六萬，漢細三六〇萬至三八七萬，火機三三五萬至三五〇萬，通州三七〇萬，白洛去四一九萬，周浦籽花六五萬，成交九百六十包。</p>

<h3>內銷茶活躍</h3>
<p>本街及蘇錫等地久吸不戢之內銷茶，昨授受依然活躍，致人心益見堅俏，賣戶喊價一味步昂，價格續再上升，他若外銷花色，出口商雖有問津，但因受國外茶價低平之影響，出價亦未鬆弛。而持者售意多趨堅化，情况頗呈吐納相持之局，交易仍陷疲境。市氣則不耐靜伏，一致高漲，惟祁門紅茶，供應尙寬，形勢獨吿盤旋。</p>
<p>湘茶外銷</p>
<p>〔本報長沙十日電〕茶葉爲湘出口貨之一，以安化臨湘等地產量最多，抗戰以來，銷路銳减。勝利後，各茶葉公司紛紛成立，品種日有改進，如安化紅茶已可媲美祁門，惟產品尙難一致爲憾。湘茶公司巳運出數萬担經滬，即可出國，預料今後後銷量可增。</p>

<p>火柴老牌鳳凰美麗走銷較旺，價回升十萬，其他新牌貨，亦好三五萬元。</p>
<h3>人心活潑向榮華股易漲難跌</h3>
<p>華股昨受金鈔黑市上漲之刺激，呈易漲雖跌之象，且商務閘北水泥各有大量買戶，宣吿漲停，尤以閘北水電得銀行帮之支助，更見俏利。永紗等漲後有回，雜股之趨勢，仍難普遍見好。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>見秀，開後一一六號買進，九四號一三〇號分別了結現遞永紗，曾自三〇八元及三六元，盤低至即交三〇八元，遞交三一六元低價。金鈔黑市奇俏，人心欲罷不能，閘北在一八〇號等吸收下，十分堅俏。一四號等進現永紗，三二號等進遞永紗，商務由二三一號，閘北由一五二號，水泥由一四九號，分別掛高至漲停板。場外息價亦低至一角九分半及二角四。十時半，會漲到即交三二六元，遞交三三〇元高價。十時四十分後，又有貸款消息，八五號等紛紛脫手，開始回跌，更經二四號脫手現永紗，二一八號了結遞交，散多亦出，近午曾迫低至三一五元及三一九元。四五號等紛買，而後以三一九元及三二三元之價收市。閘北仍由一五二號一八〇號吸收而站漲停，內衣所升亦多，結果較上週六即交股計閘北漲停，商務水泥漲達限度有回，軋升一成左右。內衣漲一成，華　景綸好半成，新華中絲微挫，恒應平平，餘均微升。　交股計美亞漲半成不到，餘均微升。塲外各老股除大生等尙平外，餘均趨秀。</p>
<h3>外銷漸有起色　我生絲前途樂觀　三年內可望增高五萬祖</h3>

<p>目前如照黑市計算，我生絲可全部出口，即照市價計算，亦與實際成本已漸接近，故生絲前途，頗爲樂觀。如今後仍能貫激絲織協導計劃，三年內決能增五萬担，五年即可恢復戰前之十萬担數量。現內銷亦逐漸增加，不但可織絲綢及襪子，蠢繭並可作絲被及棉袍，用途極廣，一般顧慮，決無問題。</p>

<p>公債昨略向榮　統丙晨開一五二〇〇元，五五二室及大成興進至一五九〇〇元，三六〇室五五五室脫手，降至一五一〇〇元而後銷盤，結果較國慶前，計甲乙升二〇〇元，丙丁微升一〇〇元，統戊漲起五〇〇元，威交約五百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨又受金鈔刺激而復昂，怡紗晨開一八〇〇〇〇元，高價達一九〇〇〇〇元，而後在一八三〇〇〇元左右掙扎。銀行幫及散戶股手，廣幫北幫洋行幫買進，結果較國慶前，計會德豐　植漲起一成，業廣紙業銅業各好半成，怡啤航業平平，餘均微升。</p>
<h3>行局差出銀根續鬆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨在票據交換所繼續差出二〇四億元，銀根繼續，暗息仍　二角一分，華股場外多方貼息二角四分。昨日中央入二三九德元，大交換入一六一億元，外商入三八四億元，小交換出三四一億元。其他行局，除中國出七五一億元外，大多均屬差入。</p>
<h3>本年浙江棉蔴約可收足八九成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司副總經理吳味經，近自浙江棉蔴產區視察歸來，據談：本年浙江棉蔴產區，因氣候較爲乾燥，故預計約可收足八九成。本年全省棉花產量，約可達卅五萬祖左右。其中德氏棉佔一萬餘担，脫棉佔四萬餘担，其餘均爲土種棉　　前市價，大多以米價計算，計德氏棉每斤合米十斤，脫氏棉每斤合米七斤半，土種棉每斤合米六斤。最近產棉區米價，每斤約合三千五百元。爲明年積極推擴，產棉可達八十萬担。蔴產方面，本年原定卅萬担，現大致可收穫廿萬担。比較印度及台灣蔴種，最受歡迎。現一担蔴，約合　　斗半云。</p>
<h3>農行本年度農貨計貨出九千餘億</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行定下月二日，在京舉行股東大會，除報吿業務及決算情形外，並決定盈餘之分配</p>
<p>又悉：據該行協理薛油　談，本年度農貸，共貸出九千餘億，以蠢貸最多。春秋兩季貸出四千餘億，其次爲棉貸，貸出一千三百餘億，普通農貸，貸出一千億，茶貸八百餘億，菸葉二百八十億，加以黃泛區各項復興貸款，總計九千餘億。</p>
<p>今後業務，仍推行國策，以生產爲主要貸款對象，因我國今日唯一急務，厥爲增加生產。糧食增產所需要之肥料，將予特別之重視。</p>
<p>至明年度晨貸計劃，正着手草擬中，即送四聯總處作最後核定，原則決無變更，僅技術問題，及農貸數額，有所增减。惟本行資金有限，目前實難滿足各方之需要，但於整個國策，已充分盡其職責。</p>

<h3>「洛神賦」的人像描寫</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>當我在學校裹講授辭賦的時候，常常感覺到一種幾乎是各處皆同的一般現象，屈原的「離騷」自不必說，就不如他的「九歌」那樣容易被學生們接受，就連辭賦之大成者庚子山，他底「哀江南賦」和「小園賦」，也不大受學生的歡迎；當時還在抗戰，流離的景象在「哀江南賦」裹，可以說是寫得淋瀝盡致的了，然而學生們不喜歡。也許是理解力不够，或者是親身經歷得太少的緣故，我當時想。</p>
<p>可是，每當我講到曹子建的「洛神賦」時，出奇的，一向都很普遍地得到學生們的歡迎，這自然不是我講洛神賦有什麽獨到的見地，而學生們也不是頑石，對於一篇描繪得神化了的文章，自然也比一些太莊嚴了的和太抽象的文章來得容易了解；因此，也就啓迪了我對於洛神賦的人像描繪的注意和硏究興趣，由於這種注意（我一向老是好讀書不求甚解的囫圇吞棗），才發現這位「天下文章一石，子建獨得八斗」的陳思王，使他聲名藉甚的洛神賦，不過是東拾西掇而來的一段錦繍文章，但是，他也有一個好處，就是對於人物的白描和羣像，都寫得那末栩栩如生，理路分明，只是道一點，在行文的章法和人像的描繪上，也該居於第一流的。</p>
<p>這裹，爲着節省篇幅起見，我先談談他對於人像描寫的好處，然後再來舉幾個例于，看看這種句法的組織安排和形容辭的所自來處，以備有興緻硏究「洛神賦」的博雅君子，做爲引玉之磚：</p>
<p>洛神賦的一開頭，和魏晋時的風氣並無二致，我們可以不必加以注意，那不過說他如何過洛水因感甄而賦的小引，但是在這短短的四十一個字裹，却明明白白地吿訴我們、只不過是：「感宋玉對楚王神女之事，遂作斯賦。」，可見一切都是白日的夢藝，其所見所聞，全屬十虛烏有，這是當時辭賦的濫觴，不足引以爲據的。</p>
<p>最先，曹子建顯示給我們的，是一號仕女圖，從遠而近，層次分明；他在「余吿之日」以下，先是一個輪廓畫的白描，及至「邊纖得衷」以下，便是工筆畫。其：「翩若驚鴻，婉若游龍；」兩句，是寫宓妃在遠觀時的「動」態，「榮耀秋菊，華茂春松。」兩句，是寫宓妃靜時之儀態；接着兩句：「彷彿兮，若輕雲之敝月；飄飄兮，若流風之廻雪。」也是前者寫靜而後者寫動的。在這種大貌的描繪旣盡，他又用兩句來特別顯示宓妃的遠觀與近視的艷麗：「遠而望之，晈若太陽升朝霞；迫而察之，灼若芙　出絲波。」這種白描人像，可謂至矣盡矣了。</p>
<p>接着，曹子建就用仇十洲工笨仕女的描繪方法，來精工雕塑出一具洛神的造像，先從體態寫到面部，然後又復歸於衣著，眞是古典主義精微的描寫，我們試看：</p>
<p>得衷修短合度，肩若削成，腰若約素；（寫體態）延頸秀項，皓質呈露，芳澤無加，鉛華弗御。（寫自然風韻）雲替峨峨，修眉聯娟，丹唇外朗，皓齒內鮮；明眸善睞，　輔承權。（寫面貌美）環姿艷逸，儀靜體閒，柔情綽態，媚於語言。（寫姿態美）……披羅衣之　粲兮，珥瑤碧之華琚，戴金翠之首飾，綴明珠以耀　；踐遠遊之文　，曳霧稍之　裾。（寫服飾美）……」</p>
<p>這一華都是刻意寫出洛神的「靜」的美，以下就寫她底「動」和儀仗之關：</p>
<p>「忽焉縱體，以邀以嬉；（動如脫兎）左倚采旄，右蔭掛旗。（儀仗）……」</p>
<p>緊跟着他又寫出自己「悅其淑美」的心情，和「托微波而通辭」的舉動，於是兩心相印，若即若離，寫得恍恍惚惚，迷迷濛濛：</p>
<p>「於是洛靈感焉，徙倚徬徨，神光離合，乍陰乍陽；（洛神內心矛盾表現於外在之形象）竦輕軀以鶴立，若將飛而未翔。（不安的動搖心理之表現）」</p>
<p>寫到這裹，曹子建突然以神來之筆，靜中轉動；寫到洛靈感而無主，繼之以長吟表示永慕，或將就決於姊妹行也；這稱女兒態寫得微妙至極。於是，八斗文思似乎如泉湧至，突然兎起　落，筆若游龍的朗朗然直洩無遺地寫了下去。這種從一個人的描繪，突然轉入羣像的描寫，旁枝細葉，無不觸及的筆調，真是不可追及：</p>
<p>「　　　　　　，命　　倡；（相招引也）威戲清流，可　　清，或採明珠，或拾　羽·（寫羣神動態——組　）……體迅飛鳥，　忽若神，陵彼微步，羅模生慶；動無常則，若危若安，滋止難期，若往若還。（寫羣像之動——細寫，極盡　渺恍惚之能事；前面的四個「或」字，和後面的四個「若」字，前後呼應，正因爲是在假想，故用這種游疑不定之辭，愈更增加其矇朧美。）含辭未吐，氣若幽蘭，華容婀娜，令我忘飱……（寫目迷五色之態。）」</p>
<p>從上述的幾段裹，我們很可以看出曹子建怎樣利用了叙事詩的形式，（我總愛把賦比做叙事詩的，自然，在過去賦裏的抒情的成份還是很重，也許由於中國這個民族，一向重於純抒情的形式罷？）</p>
<p>就在這幾段裹，我們無疑的可以看出他很著重於人像的描寫；（當然在「高唐賦」，「登徒子好色賦」，「神女賦」裏也是這樣寫法的，這自然不是創始於曹子建；關於這方面，下面再略爲硏討。）最先，他寫出洛神的遠觀近貌，再寫輪廓，再予着色，再次由靜寫動，而後寫羣像……這樣條理分明的描寫，實在値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>關於「洛神賦」得益於前人的，那眞是罄竹難書，這裹我只舉於幾個要點，略一引證，讀者有心，按圖索驥，自不難領會於其字句之出處也。</p>
<p>首先，曹子建的一段設辭，擬於洛水之濱與御者的應對，可以說究全套用「高唐」，「神女」等賦的舊章，試看</p>
<p>「忽焉思散，俯則未察，仰以殊觀，覩一麗人，于　之畔，迺援御者而吿之曰：「爾有觀於彼者乎，彼何人斯，若此之蜚也？」御者對曰：「臣聞　河洛之神，名日宓妃；然則君王所見，無迺是乎？其狀若何，臣願聞之」……」（洛神賦）</p>
<p>「昔者，楚襄王與宋玉遊於雲夢之台……王曰：「昔者先王，　遊高唐，怠而畫寢，」王曰：「試爲寡人賦之」……」。（高唐賦）</p>
<p>「楚襄王與宋玉遊於雲夢之浦……其夜王寢，果夢與神女遇，其狀甚麗，王異之，明日以白玉，王曰；「其夢若何？」……。」（神女賦）</p>
<p>這裏，我們可以看出高唐·神女兩賦所說的同是楚襄王與宋玉遊於雲夢的故事，其設辭可以說是完全相像，也許是一事被衍爲二。致於浴神賦，則借重於前者的不外兩點：（一）用兩人對語，繼之而賦女人之美，（二）用神女以寄幽思，在叙事方面，還有不出多大的影響來。可是在後面，却有許多地方足以看出曹子建襲用前人的描寫方法了：</p>
<p>「遠而聽之，若　鳳和鳴戲雲中；迫而察之，若衆葩數榮矅春風……」（琴賦）</p>
<p>「遠而望之，皎若太陽升朝霞；迫而察之，灼若芙　出錄波……」（洛神賦）「其始來也：耀乎若白日初出照屋樑；其少進也，皎若明月舒其光……」（神女賦）</p>
<p>「其始出也：　兮若松榯，其少進也，晣今若姣姬，揚袂障日而望所思。」（高唐賦）</p>
<p>這上面舉的，是四篇賦裏對於神女的粗略描寫（琴賦寫聲韻之美），下面我們再來看他們的工筆畫：</p>
<p>「……壞姿瑋態，不可勝贊……其盛飾也：則羅執綺繢盛文章，極服妙采照萬方；振　衣，被桂裳，禮不短，纖不長，步裔裔兮曜殿堂；忽兮改容，婉若遊龍乘雲翔……骨法多奇，應君之相……溫潤之玉顏……眉　娟以蛾揚兮、朱脣灼其若丹；素質幹之　實兮，志解泰而體閑……」（神女賦）</p>
<p>「……臣柬家之子，增之一分則太長，减之一分則太短；著粉則太白，施朱則太赤。眉如翠羽，肌如白雪；腰如束素，齒如含貝……」（登徒子好色賦）</p>
<p>「禯纖得衷，修短合度，肩若削成，腰若約素；延頸秀項，皓質呈露。芳澤無加，鉛筆弗御……修眉聯娟，丹　外朗，皓齒內鮮……」（洛神賦）</p>
<p>致於寫兩情相眷的筆調，也頗有相似之處，試看：</p>
<p>「賽余幃而請御兮，願盡心之惓惓……陳嘉辭而云對兮，吐芬芳其若蘭。精交接以來往兮，心凱康以樂歡；神獨享而朱結兮，魂焭焭以無端。」（神女賦）</p>
<p>「動朱唇以徐言，陳交接之大綱……抗羅袂以掩涕兮，淚流襟之浪浪……」（洛神賦）</p>
<p>這些，當然不是把曹子建當做文抄公來看的，因爲在漢魏以來，相引以徵確實成了風氣，如古詩十九首中的「靑靑河畔草」，「靑靑河邊草」，「靑靑陵上拍」……「中有尺素書」，「努力加飧飯」等，則可知一人不能轉移風氣之漸了。</p>
<p>洛神賦得力的當然不止這幾篇，詩經裹的「碩人三章」，楚辭的「山鬼」等篇，以及嘯賦，琴賦·笙賦……裏都可以找到蛛絲馬跡，我們不應該以此來蜚短流長於曹子建，正因爲這樣，才知道如何呌做「集大成」！</p>
<p>總之，洛神賦在藝術上的完整性是無缺的，尤其以短短的一　賦來描繪人像，不特可以看出功力甚深，而且也可以看出神來之筆呢！此外，洛神賦的長處，是曹子建在裏面注入了眞實的情感，因此，文章寫得悱惻動人，情思繼綿，也是浮辭虛誇的魏晋文學所不及的。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle in Jiaodong, National Army Achieves a Great Victory, Situation in Northeast Becomes Increasingly Clear, Tensions on Beining Road, Zheng Dongguo Flies to Jinzhou</h3>
<p>(Report from Qingdao, this newspaper, 11th) After eight days and nights of fierce fighting on the borders of Gaomi, Changyi, and Weixian, the National Army has achieved an unprecedented victory in the Jiaodong battlefield. Li Jianji, commander of the bandit's Second Column, was killed, and over 25,000 bandit troops were annihilated, with a large amount of military supplies captured. This battle, which began on October 3rd, saw the remnants of the bandits gather approximately 100,000 troops from various main forces in eastern Shandong and southern Shandong to concentrate their attack on the Fanjiaji position. The defending troops of Huang Guo's division, with only four regiments, held their ground against more than ten times their number of bandits, awaiting reinforcements. Thanks to our large air force providing assistance day and night, and reinforcements from various locations advancing non-stop, by the morning of the 9th, our troops had completed the encirclement on all sides. With the assistance of the air force, we launched a general offensive against the bandits. The defending troops at Fanjiaji also took the opportunity to counterattack bravely. By nightfall, the bandits had suffered heavy casualties and were on the verge of collapse. By the morning of the 10th, the remnants of the bandits were forced to flee in three directions. Their Ninth Column fled north, seemingly returning to the Dazeshan area, while the Second and Seventh Columns fled southwest towards Zhuyang and Jingzhi. The siege of Fanjiaji was lifted, and this battle concluded victoriously. The Jiaodong campaign is expected to be completed smoothly.</p>
<p>(Report from Jinan, this newspaper, 11th) The National Army, coming from Pingdu to reinforce Taitou, eliminated communist resistance along the way and joined forces with Wang Lingyun's National Army in Taitou on the 11th.</p>
<p>(Report from Changchun, this newspaper, 11th) The situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly clear. The battle between Tieling and Kaiyuan is the biggest key to the change in the war situation. Currently, reinforcements from within the pass are pouring into the Northeast, so the communist bandit's fate will be determined within a week. The communist bandits in Songbei seem to have new actions. They have been mobilizing on a large scale near the Songhua River, leveling all the trenches they had previously dug to prevent the National Army from advancing.</p>
<p>(Report from Shenyang, this newspaper, 11th) The weather is cold and rainy, and the war has not stopped. The bandits have no power to capture major strongholds on the front lines and are now harassing weaker areas, seemingly considering new strategies. On the northern front, the bandits are focusing on Tieling, gathering forces to besiege it, and also using scattered units to launch sneak attacks on the railway connecting Tieling and Shenyang. The Dalongfu Bridge, north of Wenguantun Station, eight kilometers north of Shenyang, was suddenly attacked by over a thousand bandits at 11 PM on the 10th. The traffic police resisted forcefully. After about an hour of fighting, the National Army rushed to reinforce and drove the bandits back. On the western front, the bandits intensified their attack on Xinlitun. The National Army's forces were weaker, and Xinlitun was captured by the bandits before noon on the 9th. Xinlitun is a key point connecting Jinzhou, Dahushan, Jincheng, Beining, and Tongliao. Fuxin coal production is also transported through here to Shenyang. The Hongluoxian highway station, about sixty kilometers southwest of Jinzhou, was captured by a part of the bandit's Twelfth Brigade on the 10th.</p>
<p>(Another Telegram) Zheng Dongguo, accompanied by Shu Shicun, commander of a certain army corps, flew to Jinzhou on the 11th to take command. The fighting on the Beining Road has become tense again.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shenyang, 11th) After the elite army arrived in Yingkou, the morale of the people was greatly boosted, and the fighting around Yingkou subsided.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th) The National Army in Jilin and Changchun has effectively controlled the entire area south of the Songhua River in the Jilin-Changchun area. The National Army in eastern Jilin still controls major strongholds such as Wulajie, Longtanshan, and Dafengman. There are no large bandit traces within fifty kilometers along the Jilin-Changchun line. The National Army in Changchun tightly controls the two major strongholds of Nong'an and Dehui within a hundred kilometers to the northwest.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Begins on the Outskirts of Luoyang, Songbu and Huang'an Captured in Eastern Hubei</h3>
<p>(Report from Kaifeng, this newspaper, 11th) Military news: A part of the bandits besieging Luoyang, about a brigade in strength, attacked the area around the West Gate bus station last night under the planned enticement of the National Army. The National Army dispatched a large number of tanks from the West Gate, using intense firepower to attack the bandits. At the same time, the reserve forces ambushed at Guandizhong also joined the annihilation battle with great speed. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered over three thousand casualties and collapsed. Another bandit force of unknown size is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in the area east of Luoyang.</p>
<p>(Report from Zhengzhou, this newspaper, 11th) The true face of the communist bandits attacking Luoyang has been revealed. There are 20,000 bandits near the West Palace, engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. Gunfire is also very intense near the West Gate.</p>
<p>(Report from Hankou, this newspaper, 11th) The National Army's elite troops captured the two towns of Songbu and Huang'an on the 10th, and also recovered Tuanfeng. They also defeated the bandits east of Yangluo, and the remnants are fleeing to Cangzibu. The situation in Wuhan is becoming more stable. The bandits harassing Lijiaji (south of Qiting) are currently being encircled and annihilated by our army.</p>
<p>Train on Pingbao Line Hits Landmine Again</p>
<p>(Report from Baoding, this newspaper, 10th) After the Pingbao line was opened to traffic, it was sabotaged for the first time on the 10th. At 8 AM, an engineering train departed from Baoding North. At 10 AM, it hit a landmine ten kilometers between Xushui and Gucheng, causing four carriages to overturn.</p>
<p>Chairman Receives Minister Bai</p>
<p>(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) Chairman Jiang summoned Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi at his official residence at 10 AM on the 11th for about half an hour. The Chairman gave Minister Bai important instructions. In the afternoon at 3:30 PM, Mr. Bai met with all members of the Taipei City Council's Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Municipal Inspection Group and inquired in detail about the recent situation in Taipei.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Captured in Beiping</h3>
<p>Confessed to Being Important Members, Case to be Announced Soon</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Beiping, 11th) This city recently cracked down on an important communist bandit organization, including Meng Xian Gong and Li Gongyi, students of Peking University, and Tian Cong, a teacher at Beiming Girls' High School, who participated in communist bandit activities. After being arrested and interrogated, all confessed to being important members of the communist bandits, responsible for stealing information from military and government agencies and carrying out sabotage. The evidence is solid, and they have written confessions detailing their involvement in the Communist Party and their tasks. At this critical moment of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, the Chang Bureau attaches great importance to this case and will severely punish them according to law. The details of the case will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Central Government Makes New Arrangements for Military Operations to Suppress Bandits in the Northwest</p>
<p>(Report from Beiping, this newspaper, 11th) The central government has made new arrangements for military operations to suppress bandits in the Northwest. Sources say that Ma Hongbin has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, responsible for military affairs in eastern Longdong. Ma Hongkui will be responsible for suppressing bandits along the Sanbian line. The duties of Hu Zongnan and Deng Bingcan will remain largely the same.</p>

<p>(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) The British Parliamentary Delegation arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 9th and immediately paid respects to Chairman Jiang and his wife, and dined with them. At 10 AM on the 10th, a special press conference was held at the British Ambassador's residence. Ambassador Stevenson introduced the delegation members to the reporters present one by one. The delegation leader, Lord Ammon, said in his speech: the delegation is extremely happy to meet with members of the press, so they held this meeting as soon as possible, hoping that the reporters can convey their joyful mood of coming to China during the Double Tenth Festival and the British people's earnest concern for China to the Chinese people. He then answered reporters' questions, saying: they are very concerned about the current situation in China. The general British public cannot understand why China has not yet achieved stability after winning the War of Resistance. China's war has greatly hindered Sino-British trade. British newspapers cannot publish as much news about China due to space limitations, but this does not mean that they are not concerned about China. They hope that this situation can be improved when the British economic situation improves. The general economic situation in the UK is very difficult, but now the whole country, regardless of party affiliation, is working together to increase the development of import and export trade. They believe that overcoming difficulties cannot rely on foreign aid; the UK must rely on its own efforts. As for the delay of the Sino-British trade agreement, he believes that it is a mistake in official correspondence. The vast majority of British people are willing to re-establish Sino-British business relations and strengthen Sino-British trade. If sufficient transportation and a safe environment can be obtained, there is still much that can be done. At 11:30 AM, accompanied by Ambassador Stevenson, the delegation went to the National Government to sign the congratulatory book. At noon, they visited Mayor Shen Yi at his official residence on Beiping Road and attended a banquet. In the afternoon at 3 PM, they went to the National Assembly Hall to attend the group wedding ceremony of 253 couples as honored guests. They were all very interested in this new social cause of frugality. They then visited the Xiaguan Capital Power Plant and the workers' welfare society. Dr. O'Malley, who is a doctor, was particularly interested. At 5 PM, they went to the International Friendship Association and attended a grand cocktail party invited by Vice Minister Liu Shishun. In the evening, they visited Vice Chairman Sun and stayed for a banquet at his residence. At 11 AM, they visited President Zhang Qun and Vice President Wang Yunwu, and then went to the Senate to visit Secretary-General Shao Lizi. They all still remembered the friendship of the Senate's visit to the UK during the war and deeply admired the contributions of the Senate. They visited Central University, Ginling Women's University, and Jinling University. At noon, they were treated to a lunch by Chen Yuguang (principal of Jinling University), chairman of the Nanjing City Council. In the afternoon, they visited the Central Hospital and the Children's Welfare Society. Dr. O'Malley, being a doctor, was particularly interested. At 5 PM, they attended a cocktail party hosted by Secretary-General Hang Liwu of the Central Culture Association, which was attended by 200 people. The music group of the Central Broadcasting Station performed wonderful entertainment programs such as Chinese music "Spring River Flower Moon Night," "Ambush from All Sides," and "New China Overture." Delegation leader Sir Ammon gave an impromptu speech, praising Chinese music greatly and expressing his admiration for the association's work in promoting Sino-British cultural exchange. In the evening at 8 PM, the entire delegation attended a banquet hosted by President Zhang Qun. The 12th was the delegation's third day in Nanjing. In the morning, they visited the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and had a lunch there. In the afternoon, they visited the Sun Yat-Sen Mausoleum and toured scenic spots such as Tanmu, Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, and Xuanwu Lake. In the evening, they were treated to a banquet by Ambassador Stevenson and his wife.</p>

<p>(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) The US House Military Expenditure Audit Committee delegation, including Congressman Cole and six others, flew to Nanjing from Qingdao by special plane at 11:30 AM on the 10th.

<h3>Adjusting the Salary of Public School Staff, Executive Yuan is Synthetically Discussing, Difficult to Implement According to the Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) After the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and professors from Peking University separately proposed specific opinions on the method of adjusting the salary of public school staff, the Executive Yuan is now comprehensively studying the three methods, since the deadline for the March 1st adjustment has arrived. Chen Kewen, Accountant General of the Executive Yuan, told reporters on the 11th: the method of adjusting according to the cost of living index is very appropriate, but there may be some difficulties in the implementation. Because the cost of living index not only differs from place to place, but also differs at the beginning and end of the month in one place, it is impossible to adjust every half month. If so, it should still be implemented by district, and the average of the index should be used as the standard. This method is not much different from the current method of adjusting by district on March 1st. The Executive Yuan is carefully studying a reasonable method that is easy to implement. Also, the adjustment method proposed by the Legislative Yuan was sent to the National Government on the 9th, and some people praised it. Some members of the Control Yuan believe that this method is very reasonable. The increase for low-level public school staff is less than double, and the increase for senior staff is even less. The Ministry of Social Affairs has also recently formulated a method, which is slightly the same as the method of the Legislative Yuan, but the base number is 40 yuan. It is also learned that the Executive Yuan will propose a method of adding a base number of 840,000 and 3,000 times, and it may be discussed at the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting next Tuesday, because the adjustment must be implemented starting in November.</p>
<h3>Actual Foreign Debt Payable by Our Country Totals Nearly 200 Million US Dollars, Accounts of US Lend-Lease Materials Being Cleared</h3>
<p>(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan issued a reliable message on the 11th, stating that our "Wartime Government Foreign Credit Loans," "Wartime Financial Assistance Loans," and "Post-War Government Loans" total over US$734 million in government foreign debt. If the unused portion and the "Financial Loans" that have not yet been repaid are removed, the government's actual foreign debt payable is approximately US$194 million. The total amount of principal and interest to be repaid this year is over US$37 million (of which US$20 million is to be repaid with agricultural and mineral products). As for the US Lend-Lease materials, President Truman reported to Congress on December 27 last year that the portion lent to our country was over US$1.55 billion. However, the US military used a lot of it themselves. According to unofficial estimates by the Ministry of National Defense, the actual amount received by our country is only worth over US$900 million. This is currently being cleared by both China and the United States in Washington. It cannot be included in the current debt amount until an agreement is reached. An editorial in a Shanghai newspaper on the 22nd of last month, entitled "Our Foreign Debt," stated that "the total amount of wartime foreign debt is approximately US$3.2 billion. After the war, to purchase civilian Lend-Lease materials, an agreement was signed with the United States for long-term repayment over 30 years, totaling US$58.9 million. This huge debt amount, compared to the average national income of the five years before the war, accounts for approximately 45% of it." This is inconsistent with the facts, and the figures are even more different.</p>

<h3>Bullitt's Emergency Aid to China Proposal, Chinese and American Public Opinion Attaches Great Importance, We Welcome MacArthur as Military Advisor</h3>
<p>(Report from Nanjing, this newspaper, 11th) A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: After the important essay by former US Ambassador to France and the Soviet Union, Bullitt, was published, various parties believed that Bullitt had a deep understanding of the current situation in China. The essay has attracted the attention of Chinese and American public opinion. It is believed that its results will be of great benefit to enhancing understanding and friendship between China and the United States. (For the full text of Bullitt's essay, see page 2)</p>
<p>(United Press, Nanjing, 10th) Political leaders here unanimously welcomed Bullitt's proposal for large-scale aid to China. Dong Xian Guang, director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, said: Bullitt's article is very timely and stimulating and will definitely help clarify some misunderstandings about China.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Nanjing, 11th) Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang, said: "All Chinese people welcome Bullitt's powerful and insightful suggestions. If General MacArthur can serve as China's military advisor, not only China but the entire Far East will benefit from it."</p>
<p>(United Press, Tokyo, 10th) Regarding Bullitt's proposal, which was seconded by Congressman Cole, head of the Congressional Military Inspection Group, to appoint MacArthur to oversee the $1.35 billion aid to China plan, MacArthur himself remained silent, and MacArthur's headquarters had no response. Both of them had long talks with MacArthur, but the results were not announced.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, New York, 10th) Howard Newspaper commented on Bullitt's emergency aid to China proposal on the 10th, saying: "China is our oldest, closest, and most reliable friend in Asia. Therefore, today China has become the target of the Soviet Union, just as it was the target of Japan before. The responsibility and benefits of aiding China are very clear. The only thing is that we may be too late."</p>
<h3>Marshall Writes to Various Organizations to Promote Good Relations Between China and the United States</h3>

Marshall's letter reiterated the traditional friendship between China and the United States and was a powerful boost to the appeals of American civil organizations. According to a survey of editorials in American national newspapers, in the week ending on the 4th, comments on the situation in China still expressed concern about China's internal difficulties, and direct support for the Chinese government has increased compared to before.</p>
<h3>The Government Fully Supplies Materials to Save the Price Surge, Sincerely Hopes that the People Can Help to Overcome the Economic Difficulties Together</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The economic and financial situation in Shanghai over the past two weeks has shown unprecedentedly drastic fluctuations, and all major cities in the country have been affected by it. The national economy and the people's livelihood are facing a serious threat. The reporter specially visited a leader in the economic and financial circles to inquire whether the central authorities will have new measures to deal with the current economic changes. I was informed: the recent price fluctuations are due to the widespread formation of the psychology of hoarding materials. Therefore, the current emergency plan is not just empty talk, but to make a careful supply of sufficient materials. Actual work is used to break the psychology of distrust of the monetary system, so as to save the price surge. The so-called actual work is to step up assistance in various aspects and increase the supply of materials. For example, in this period of scarcity of rice, in addition to the rice allocated to professional workers, we have also negotiated with the Ministry of Food to allocate a part of the rice to be sold to the general public. In terms of cloth, it has also been agreed that UNRRA will supply 200,000 dan of cotton to make up for the shortage of raw materials. All of this shows that the Chang Bureau is earnestly working to increase the supply of materials step by step, so there is no need to worry about the lack of normal needs. The leader then analyzed the causes of the recent economic changes and said: in the next few months, our country's economy may still have difficulties, but I hope that the general public can actively assist the government, then the difficulties can be overcome. The authorities will no longer add icing on the cake for enterprises that have already "made a fortune," and the current main economic strategy of the country is still on how to reduce the suffering of the general public from high prices.</p>

<h3>Analysis of the CCP's Strategic Evolution</h3>
<p>— Yu Xin</p>
<p>From the victory of the Anti-Japanese War to the present, from the perspective of a military science researcher, I believe that the evolution of the CCP's military strategy can be divided into three major stages: and these three stages are actually strategies that are getting worse and worse. In Guan Nei (inside the passes, referring to inland China), the first two stages have come to an end. The third stage is just beginning.</p>
<p>From August 10, 1945, when the news of the enemy's surrender spread, for about three months, it was the first stage of the CCP's strategy. The general objectives of this stage were "seizing opportunities created by sudden changes," "striving for the fruits of victory," and "sharing the world equally." At this time, the CCP overestimated its own strength; the sudden surrender of the enemy gave it tremendous spiritual encouragement. Therefore, it wanted to complete the overall control of North China in the process of accepting the surrender, and further use the strength of the Central China Military Region and the East China Military Region to threaten Wuhan and Shanghai. Therefore, strategically, it adopted the method of comprehensive offensive and partial defense, in order to seize important strategic strongholds north of the Yellow River. The first target was Gui Sui, which straddled Shanxi and Mongolia; and the forces east of the Taihang Mountains were also strategically mobilized against the four major strongholds of Ping, Jin, Ji, and Bao at the same time. Therefore, the slogan that the CCP put forward to its cadres at this time was "Be brave, be brave, and be brave again!" "Advance, advance, advance again!" The meaning was that politically, it wanted a sharp turn; militarily, it wanted to accomplish everything in one go.</p>
<p>However, this strategy required "being able to attack" as its prerequisite. Therefore, as soon as Mao Zedong left Chongqing, the battle of Suiyuan-Baotou was launched on a large scale, and the encirclement of Ping, Jin, Ji, and Bao also began at the same time. However, unfortunately for the CCP, the first test of this strategy ended in a ruthless failure. The consistent facts proved that the CCP's military strength could not only not launch a frontal attack, but also caused the overall military deployment to be disjointed due to blind attacks, heavy casualties, and errors in deployment. Therefore, under the cover of the CCP's delaying policy of negotiating while fighting in political consultations, it prepared for its second stage of strategy.</p>
<p>From July 1946 to July of this year, it was the second stage of the CCP's strategy. The general objectives of this stage were: "defend the acquired positions" and "establish a protracted war." And it put forward the slogan of "preparing for a fifteen-year long-term war" to stabilize the internal situation and wait for major international changes. Therefore, strategically, it adopted the method of partial offensive and comprehensive defense, in order to defend the large area of land that it had seized during its victory. Then, taking this as a base, it would develop as opportunities arose. Therefore, the slogans it put forward to its cadres at this time were: "Oppose mountain-stronghold mentality" and "eliminate bandit ideology!" The meaning was that going up the mountain and becoming a bandit was a last resort. Military power must be able to flourish in several stable spaces. The loss or shake of space, in the final analysis, is also the loss and shake of combat power. This is the experience and lesson that the CCP summarized from the Jiangxi era.</p>
<p>However, this strategy also required "being able to defend" as its prerequisite. However, from the National Army's recapture of Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, the Yimeng Mountains, and even a series of facts in northern Jiangsu and the Jiaodong Peninsula, it proved that the CCP could not defend.</p>
<p>The CCP not only could not attack when advancing and could not defend when retreating militarily, but also, even in places where the National Army had not yet arrived, such as central Hebei, northwestern Shanxi, and southeastern Shanxi, social production stagnated, materials were exhausted, and the people's resentment was shaken due to the CCP's excessive military exploitation, forming a situation where there was no defense to retreat to politically. Therefore, the CCP had to start its third stage of strategy.</p>
<p>The CCP's third stage of strategy began in July of this year when Mao Zedong shouted the slogan "The only way is to fight out." This strategy replaces the strategy of offense and defense with "roaming." This is the old road taken by bandits in history! Its goal is to avoid decisive battles by roaming and preserve some strength: at the same time, it destroys society by roaming, and maintains its own survival from the chaos of destruction. The successive southward crossings of the Yellow River by Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Chen Yi and other units are evolutions of this strategy. However, this strategy contains four contradictions that cannot be resolved. First, in the roaming, it cannot complete the organizational control of society, and therefore cannot cultivate new combat power. Second, Napoleon said that "military victory lies in the feet," but his "failure also lies in the feet"; because the consumption of troops from excessive maneuver is often greater than the consumption of combat. Therefore, it is not easy to maintain the original combat power by roaming. Third, in terms of guerrilla warfare, it mainly depends on the organization of the masses. The fundamental reason why the CCP has gained local advantages in some battles in the past may also lie in this. But this condition is lost in the roaming. Fourth, the result of destruction by roaming will inevitably arouse great resentment from the people and strong self-defense forces. The bandit Li Zicheng was eventually annihilated by a small number of villagers, which is the inevitable result of roaming bandits. Therefore, this is definitely not the road that Mao Zedong originally wanted to take, but objective conditions cannot but force him to take this old road. This road is the road of mountain-stronghold mentality and bandit ideology that he himself opposed. As long as he believes that his strength is sufficient in a certain area, he will immediately abandon this last road. Therefore, the CCP's sixth offensive in Guanwai (outside the passes, referring to Manchuria) is again his hope to partially restore the strategy of the first stage under international support. Because Mao Zedong thought that if he was fully forced to take the third stage of strategy, that would be his greatest tragedy!</p>

<h3>Bullitt's Impressions of Visiting China</h3>
<p>— Full Text</p>
<p>Preventing any one country from dominating China and mobilizing its 450 million people to oppose us is a matter of the utmost importance to the United States.</p>
<p>Only Japan and Russia threaten to dominate China. The United States has opposed either of these two countries when they became more dangerous aggressors. Japan is no longer a strong country. But the Soviet imperialists, who inherited the imperialism of Tsarist Russia and use the CCP as a tool of Soviet power politics, intend to turn China into an appendage of the Soviet Union. Not only China's territorial sovereignty but even its independence is in danger. For the sake of American self-defense, we must</p>
<p>Take Action</p>
<p>to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating China and mobilizing its manpower to oppose us.</p>
<p>Can China be kept out of Stalin's reach? Of course, it can. China's independence is of great interest to the United States. Compared with the price we pay to maintain its independence, the price we pay is really insignificant.</p>
<p>What method? Before answering this question, let us first review the history of the past 20 years and some current situations, which will help us answer the above question.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek succeeded in the Northern Expedition in 1928, and the power of the National Government spread throughout the country. From 1928 to 1937, although there was the Japanese seizure of the Northeast in 1931 and the communist disturbances, it was a period of great progress. By 1937, China's tax revenue had tripled compared to before, and the state treasury's revenue and expenditure were almost balanced. The New Life Movement launched by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek infused fresh blood and creative ideals into many Chinese people, especially young people. The communists were in Shaanxi, in a desperate situation, and seemed to have no power at all. Many people believed that although China had lost the Northeast, it would soon be able to restore its national strength and achieve economic soundness.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is wise. In the autumn of 1934, President Roosevelt sent the author to visit China. The report after the visit is still on file in President Roosevelt's private files. In several long conversations, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made inferences about the future of China and the Far East. His vision and wisdom were unmatched by any previous politician. He</p>
<p>Asserted that Japan</p>
<p>would not allow China to restore its national strength and would attack China again because China's restoration was proceeding too smoothly and too quickly, and it could catch up with Japan. He said that Japan would launch a war of aggression against China at the latest in 1937. The war broke out in 1937. He said that the war would start with some minor incidents between Peiping and Tianjin. Later, it did happen near Beiping at the Marco Polo Bridge. He said that he would resist in North China and then give up. He would defend the Yangtze River basin and then give up. He would fight in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan and then give up. As a result, he would establish the capital in Chongqing, Sichuan. At that time, he had invested 100 million yuan to build small-scale arsenals in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places in Sichuan. He said that the Japanese would never be able to set foot in Sichuan. He said that he would never make peace with Japan as long as he was alive. As a result, Japan would definitely be defeated. This is the entire history of 1937 to 1945.</p>
<p>At that time, he also predicted that after Japan's defeat, if he was still alive, he would face the greatest difficulty in his life. The country was devastated, the people were exhausted, and leading China to peacefully build a democratic government and modernize China's ancient culture was his wish, but he felt that it was more difficult than defeating Japan.</p>
<p>He also foresaw this very clearly. A French proverb says it well: "Foresight is important in politics!" Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has foresight.</p>
<p>In November 1943, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in Cairo. After the meeting, the following joint declaration was issued:</p>
<p>"Cairo Declaration. December 1, 1943. President Roosevelt, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill."</p>
<p>"The purpose of the three countries is to deprive Japan of all the islands it has seized and occupied in the Pacific since the beginning of World War I in 1914, and to return to China the territories that Japan has stolen from China, such as the Northeast, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands."</p>
<p>However, fourteen months later, on February 11, 1945, President Roosevelt, Chairman Stalin, and Prime Minister Churchill betrayed China and signed the</p>
<p>Secret Agreement</p>
<p>This agreement sacrificed China's sovereignty over the northeastern provinces to Soviet imperialism. No treaty signed by an American president has been more unnecessary, more shameful, or more harmful than this agreement. Because there was absolutely no factor in the world at that time that could prevent Stalin from declaring war on Japan at the last moment, and we wanted to make him participate in the war, so our allies made great sacrifices, so this was unnecessary. Because no sophistry in the world can convince a sober-minded person that we have not violated our promise to China in Cairo, so it is shameful. Because we gave Stalin the most effective weapon to dominate China and opened the road to future wars in the Far East, it is infinitely harmful. (Continued on page 5)</p>
<h3>Basic Principles of the Partition of Palestine: US Expresses Support, Willing to Assist in Maintaining Security in the Region During the Transition Period. China Hopes the UN General Assembly Will Handle With Caution.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine is meeting today. The debate is expected to be so fierce that it will overshadow the intense verbal sparring between the US and the Soviet Union over the Balkans issue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 11th] The United States today formally proposed support for the plan to partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, but with "some amendments and supplements." US Representative Johnson told the Special Committee on Palestine, "The United States is willing to participate in a viable political solution for the establishment of a UN in Palestine. The US delegation supports the basic principles of the partition and immigration plan unanimously recommended by various countries. However, to make the plan more effective, it is willing to propose some amendments and supplements. The US delegation firmly believes that there must be some geographical corrections, such as Jaffa, which is clearly an Arab city and should therefore be included in the Arab state. The US delegation recommends that the United Nations should ensure that all residents of Palestine, regardless of region or nationality, can enjoy access to ports, waterways, and electricity without discrimination, and that Arabs and Jews should have equal economic opportunities." Johnson continued, "The United States will assist in maintaining law and order in Palestine during the transition period, and US troops may also be available if obligatory police forces are needed later. However, it is hoped that the formation and abolition of such forces must be in accordance with caution." Johnson stated, "According to the final analysis, the ultimate solution to this issue depends on the Palestinian people themselves. If a new political structure is to last, the people themselves must be able to bear the responsibility of maintaining domestic order. For many years, Palestine has consistently experienced violence against the authorities and opponents, and now, due to the failure to resolve this complex issue, the trend of violence is even worse." Johnson concluded, "The reason why this issue has not been resolved to this day is that the countries concerned have failed to reach a basis for agreement. To seek a fundamental solution to the problem, the opinions of the world should be listened to most carefully."</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu declared today that China is quite hesitant to support the division of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. Such a move is difficult to justify in terms of history, law, and justice, and may lead to armed conflict. The committee should find other ways to seek a solution acceptable to both parties in the dispute.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th] As the Palestine case heats up, Britain suddenly makes a surprising move, suggesting on the evening of the 10th that all 57 members of the United Nations should take "emergency measures" to fairly absorb a portion of the displaced people around the world. Britain made this suggestion to the United Nations Palestine Committee on the eve of the United States issuing a major policy statement on the Holy Land.</p>
<h3>Palestine in a State of Alarm: Arab Armies Deploy on the Border; Jewish Underground Army Prepares to Take Self-Defense Measures</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 11th] Although news of Arab armies gathering on the border has spread, the overall situation in the Holy Land remains stable.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beirut, 10th] The armies of five Arab countries began to take action today, implementing the Arab League's resolution last night calling on all Arab peoples to defend Palestine with manpower and financial resources and to oppose the Zionist movement. Spokesmen for the Lebanese and Syrian armies said that the armies of the two countries bordering Palestine began moving at midnight yesterday, transferring to the vicinity of the border to guard against terrorist acts and Jewish conspiracies.</p>
<p>The Transjordanian army, known as the largest and best-equipped in the Middle East, has also begun to concentrate along the banks of the Jordan River at six floating camps. In addition, Egyptian troops are preparing to enter the Sinai Desert, and Saudi Arabian cavalry have, at the request of the Egyptian government, crossed the border into Egypt to participate in the iron ring blockade of Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The Palestinian Jewish Council has issued a statement declaring that if the Arabs attempt to seize Palestine by force, the Jews will engage in self-defense.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 11th] Authoritative sources in Damascus and Beirut said on the 11th that the so-called gathering of large armies in various Arab regions bordering the Holy Land was a "wonderful fantasy." They pointed out that the Arabs do not intend to launch a decisive military action before the United Nations makes a decision on Palestine. Grand Mufti al-Husseini and Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy Pasha went to Damascus to meet with Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli.</p>
<h3>Arab League Conference Moves to Amman</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beirut, 10th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha said that King Abdullah of Transjordan fully agreed with the Arab League Council's decision that when Britain withdraws from Palestine, neighboring Arab countries should provide the Arabs of the Holy Land with military, moral, and economic assistance. The Arab League's "war preparation" secret talks will move from Lebanon to the Transjordanian capital of Amman on the 12th, where the chief representatives of the seven members of the League, namely Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, will secretly discuss with the King of Transjordan detailed measures to assist the Arabs of the Holy Land.</p>
<h3>Lebanon Receives Husseini, Britain Protests</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government has protested to the Lebanese Foreign Office through its Middle East representative Evans regarding the fact that the Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, flew from Egypt to Beirut, Lebanon, and informed them that the Lebanese government's decision to receive Husseini had created an unfortunate impression in Britain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain would probably not protest to Egypt about Husseini's flight to Beirut to attend the meeting, as Egypt had guaranteed last year that Husseini would not engage in political activities in Egypt, which did not include prohibiting him from leaving Egypt.</p>
<h3>Britain Pays Close Attention to the Situation in the Holy Land: If Armed Conflict Occurs Between the Arab and Jewish Peoples, It Will Consider Revising Treaties with Egypt and Two Other Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] A Foreign Office spokesman said, "Rumors that Egyptian, Syrian, and Lebanese troops are advancing towards the Palestinian border do not affect Britain's decision to withdraw from Palestine if a solution without Arab-Jewish agreement is not reached. We sincerely hope that the Jews and Arabs can reach an agreement to avoid bloodshed."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 11th] A British Foreign Office spokesman recently stated that if the trend of armed conflict develops near the Holy Land, Britain will consider revising its treaties with Egypt, Iraq, and Transjordan, which include clauses regarding the supply of British weapons to these three countries. However, the spokesman declared that Britain does not believe in the possibility of armed conflict, and if Britain believes that there is a threat of war between the Arabs and Jews, it will submit the matter to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>US Mediterranean Fleet to Visit Greece</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 9th] The US Embassy announced that the US aircraft carrier "Leyte" will lead the 6,000-ton cruiser "Juneau" and the 2,000-ton destroyer "Massey" to visit Athens within two weeks.</p>
<h3>Kurdish Riots on the Turkish Border</h3>
<p>Communists Support Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 9th] Ali reported that a major riot by the Kurdish tribes in the Cizre district near the Turkish-Syrian border, where the Turkish and Iraqi railways connect, was launched by a Kurdish chieftain, intending to declare an independent Kurdish state. Communists support this independence movement. After the failed uprising of the Kurds in Iraqi territory in 1945, their leader Barzani led his troops to flee into Iran. Tonight, they were severely suppressed by Iranian troops. At the same time, some chieftains who supported the Kurdish independence movement have surrendered to the Iraqi government.</p>
<h3>Balkan Monitoring Committee: 11 Countries Including China and the Soviet Union Elected, Headquarters Located in Thessaloniki</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th] Disregarding the prior opposition of the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries, the United Nations Political Committee voted 32 to 1 to elect 11 countries, including China, the Soviet Union, Poland, the United States, Britain, France, Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, Australia, and Pakistan, to the Balkan Special "Monitoring" Committee. Twelve countries abstained, and twelve other countries did not participate in the vote. It was also resolved that the headquarters would be located in Thessaloniki, and work would begin 30 days after the UN General Assembly approved the case.</p>

<h3>Truman Clarifies Position: The United States Has No Intention of Dominating Any Country, Currently Rushing to Raise US Dollars to Intensify Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] President Truman, when hosting the press today, responded to the Soviet Union's most recent accusations of "US imperialism," saying that the United States has no intention of economically dominating any country or any continent. The government is currently rushing to raise US dollars for emergency aid to Europe.</p>
<p>No Way to Allocate Assistance to France for the Time Being</p>
<p>As far as France is concerned, there is no way to allocate funds to provide assistance for the time being. When the President spoke of the establishment of the new Communist International, he said that Under Secretary of State Lovett had fully expressed his views on this matter, and that he believed that what the United States had always hoped for was lasting peace and prosperity throughout the world for the benefit of all countries.</p>
<h3>US Food Conservation Movement Faces Possible Total Failure</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] US officials expressed serious concern that President Truman's voluntary food conservation movement may face total failure. To date, restaurants across the country have failed to comply with the President's call to set aside meat-free, egg-free, and poultry-free days each week.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Returns Home, Claims US Has Guaranteed Assistance</h3>
<p>French Prime Minister's New Measures Meet with Poor Response</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] French Foreign Minister Bidault, after returning from the United States, told the French people who were protesting Prime Minister Ramadier's "saving the franc" austerity plan that the United States had morally guaranteed to provide France with transitional assistance. He said at the airport, "I am very pleased with what Washington has done or is preparing to do." Bidault is expected to announce the details of the US aid plan for France over the weekend. French newspapers unanimously condemned Ramadier's remarks yesterday that "national spending must be reduced by 23 percent, and we must implement quotas and levy heavy taxes on scarce goods."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 11th] The drivers' union suddenly went on strike on the 11th, allowing only a few lines to run one car per hour, leaving millions of people unable to move. A large number of police officers have rushed to the station to maintain order.</p>
<h3>French-Vietnamese War Intensifies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hanoi, 10th] Semi-official French sources said that the large-scale military operation recently launched by the French army in the Tokyo region against the Viet Minh forces has made smooth progress on all fronts. In addition to announcing the occupation of Son Tay in the northwest, the French army communique also announced the occupation of Thong An and another important city, Hue Binh. The French forces in Hanoi and Hue Binh have joined forces. The French army's actions are mainly carried out by paratroopers. According to unconfirmed reports, Viet Minh Finance Minister Ly Van Huu has been captured by the French army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, West German, 10th] Agence France-Presse said that former Annam King Bao Dai will soon meet with senior French officials in Vietnam to discuss the Vietnamese political situation. The meeting will take place on a neutral ship.</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia Announces Decision to Sever Diplomatic Relations with Chile: Soviet Ambassador to Chile Attacked But Unharmed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Yugoslav Capital, 11th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a formal statement today announcing Yugoslavia's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Chile. It is said that the Chilean government accused the secretary of the Yugoslav embassy in the capital of Argentina, Gaska, and the chargé d'affaires in the capital of Chile, Konga, of being diplomats from a "Moscow satellite state," colluding with the Chilean Communist Party to disrupt Chile, and expelled them from the country. This constitutes "an extremely arrogant defamatory act" against the Yugoslav government and "violates the basic principles of international relations," and is clearly part of "a planned act."</p>
<p>[United Press, Chilean Capital, 11th] President Videla today reiterated his unwavering belief in eliminating the Communist Party's control over the working class and ordered the strict implementation of coal rationing and the storage of fuel for military use. It is said that the current coal mine strike was instigated by the Communist Party at the instigation of foreign countries, with the aim of undermining Chile's security in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chilean Capital, 10th] Soviet Ambassador to Chile, Tsukov, was shot at here on the 10th. The assailant drove a very fast car and fired eleven shots at the ambassador, who was fortunately unharmed. The Chilean government immediately apologized to the Soviet Embassy.</p>
<h3>Deadlock in Tariff Negotiations Expected to Be Broken: Britain Reportedly Making Concessions to the US, British-US Trade Agreement to Be Signed Soon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] British officials here said that a British-US trade agreement could be reached soon. British Ambassador Lord Inverchapel visited Secretary of State Marshall in New York. Responsible parties believe that the British ambassador intends to inform Marshall of Britain's new recommendations on reducing US tariffs and British imperial trade preferential tariffs in order to reach an agreement with the US.</p>
<p>State Department officials also revealed that when US Under Secretary of State Clayton visited London, he told Cripps that after Britain refused to make concessions, the US Congress and government would be negatively affected by the aid to Europe plan. It is generally believed that the breaking of the deadlock in British-US tariff negotiations is mostly due to Clayton's warning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Authoritative sources said that the United States has put forward new recommendations that are expected to break the deadlock in tariff negotiations. It is reported that the new US recommendations are particularly favorable to British shipping merchants. The United States can therefore expect the UK and Commonwealth countries to reduce, or in some cases completely abolish, trade preferential limits, so as to be closer to the original US recommendations.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Fiercely Criticizes US Foreign Economic Policy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th] Soviet Representative Arutiunian delivered a lengthy speech in the United Nations Economic and Financial Committee on the 10th, condemning the United States' foreign economic policy. The Soviet Union accused the US "ruling class" of promoting "the Marshall Plan in Europe and the MacArthur Plan in Japan," which are actually two parts of completing the world's sole plan. The United States attempts to rebuild Germany's war potential, rebuild Greece as a base for US expansion in Europe and the Middle East, and "restore Japan's imperialism." Arutiunian severely criticized the British-US decision to raise the industrial standards of western Germany, saying that this move directly violates the Potsdam Agreement and aims to rebuild the Ruhr region as a base for the US expansion plan in Europe. Arutiunian also blamed the United States for Britain's economic situation. The United States often attaches "intolerable conditions" to its aid to other countries. The United States is using Britain's current financial difficulties to force Britain to adopt policies that are harmful to its interests in the name of aid.</p>

<h3>Imposing Business Tax on Food Will Increase the Burden Only on Citizens. Two Groups, the Commerce Association and Others, Will Hold a Meeting Today to Launch a Nationwide Appeal by Grain Merchants for Exemption from Taxation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Grain merchants previously requested exemption from business tax on food, and the central government approved a one-year exemption, which expires at the end of September this year. Taxation will begin from October 1st, with a tax rate of 15 per mille. Grain merchants from the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, jointly appealed to the central government in July for exemption from taxation. The Ministry of Finance rejected the appeal. The preparatory offices of the Republic of China General Chamber of Commerce and the Republic of China Grain Business Association Federation are scheduled to hold a meeting at 2:00 PM today at 377 Minguo Road to discuss launching representatives from chambers of commerce and grain merchants in various provinces and cities across the country to appeal to the central government again for exemption. The preparatory offices of the National Chamber of Commerce and the Grain Merchants Business Association Federation hosted the press last night to report on the process of requesting exemption from the business tax on food. According to Zhen Hua, executive director of the Shanghai Rice and Grain Association, food has never been taxed, as is the case in various countries. Overseas grain shipments to China are exempt from import taxes, etc. Especially at a time when rice prices are fluctuating and food is severely in short supply, taxation will have a serious impact. At present, Shanghai's daily consumption of rice is 15,000 shi. If the market price is 800,000 per shi, the tax per shi is 12,000 yuan, totaling 180 million yuan per day. The daily consumption of miscellaneous grains is 6,000 dan. If the market price is 400,000 per dan, the tax per dan is 6 yuan, totaling 36 million yuan per day. The daily consumption of flour is 12,000 bags. Cargo tax has already been paid when it leaves the factory. If food business tax is also required, with a market price of 240,000 per bag, the tax per bag is 3,600 yuan, totaling 43.2 million yuan per day. The total tax revenue is 259.2 million yuan, which is the food business tax that Shanghai should pay every day. This does not affect the interests of the grain merchants themselves, but increases the burden on ordinary citizens. Moreover, rice and grain go through rice milling merchants, wholesalers, transporters, distributors, sales area wholesalers, and retailers from the place of origin, totaling six times of business tax to be paid, which will eventually be added to the citizens who buy food. The heaviness of the burden is self-evident. At present, the central government believes that there are two reasons why exemptions cannot be granted: If food business tax can be exempted, other daily necessities merchants will follow suit and request exemptions as precedents. Food business tax is a local tax, and exemption will affect local finances. However, in the first point, the nature of each industry is different, and there will be no precedent. The government does not need to worry about this. In the second point, the local government's financial budget has not included food business tax, so exemption will not affect it.</p>
<h3>Two Reasons for Gasoline Price Increase: Recent Increase in Foreign Exchange Rate and Collection of Tariffs, Explanation from Person in Charge of the Transportation and Management Committee</h3>
<p>Regarding the increase in gasoline prices, according to the person in charge of the Gasoline and Diesel Allocation Committee of the Transportation and Management Committee! All fuel is imported from abroad, and when the foreign exchange rate changes, it will inevitably change accordingly. Otherwise, the cost of the oil company will not be enough, which will inevitably lead to a reduction in supply. After the exchange settlement method was changed on August 18, gasoline needed foreign exchange, and the exchange settlement was based on the market price. Its cost was about three times higher than the original official price. The Committee repeatedly negotiated with the oil companies and advised them not to increase prices too drastically. In order to maintain stable oil prices, the oil companies agreed not to increase prices in proportion.</p>
<p>Recently, the increase in the exchange rate has indeed increased the cost of importing fuel. In addition, starting from the first day of this month, the Ministry of Finance announced that a tariff of 50% would be collected on gasoline imports. Due to these two reasons, the oil companies have repeatedly applied for price increases. The Committee will investigate its actual costs and verify the regulations. As for tariffs, it is a national tax revenue. There was this tariff before the war, and the current tax rate is the same as before the war. Before the war, the selling price of gasoline was nine cents to one yuan per gallon. The current selling price is 25,500 yuan. Compared to other commodity prices, it is relatively low. However, gasoline imports consume national foreign exchange. Recently, the United Kingdom has reduced the number of automobiles and restricted personal oil use, which is a last resort to save national foreign exchange. At this difficult time in our country, we sincerely hope that the people of the country will follow the example of the United Kingdom and save as much gasoline as possible to reduce the expenditure of national foreign exchange. The adjustment of gasoline prices is within the scope of the authority of the Import and Export Management Committee and has nothing to do with the Central Bank.</p>

<h3>New Canadian Ambassador to Shanghai Holds First Reception for Reporters Yesterday, Discussing Friendly Relations between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The new Canadian Ambassador to China, Dai Weishi, arrived in China in May. He recently arrived in Shanghai for the first time from Beijing. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, he formally hosted reporters at the Cathay Hotel for the first time and made a statement, saying: "I feel deeply honored and also feel a great responsibility to assume the position of Canadian Ambassador to China at this time. Because I believe that these years are one of the most important pages in Chinese history. China and Canada have many things in common, and have always been friendly over the years. This war shortened the war and saved the lives of many people in allied countries because of China's heroic resistance. I believe that all allied countries must be grateful to China. But we express our regret for the domestic disputes that China encountered after completing the war of resistance. I hope that China can end the war as soon as possible and move towards the road of restoration and national construction.</p>
<p>Trade between China and Canada began more than fifty years ago. Canada supplies more than 50% of China's newsprint. Although Canada's own production has decreased, it will still reduce supplies to other markets and supply more to China. At the same time, railway sleepers, flour, timber, mining tools, etc. are all important commodities for trade between China and Canada. And under Canada's price control, its prices have risen very slightly compared with the end of the war. On the Chinese side, Canada needs Chinese wool to make carpets, [missing character] tin to make steel, pig [missing character] to make brushes, as well as walnuts, peanuts, handicrafts, etc. Therefore, I firmly believe that mutual trade between the two countries will increase in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the peace treaty with Japan, our country is also paying close attention. We are very eager to know that Japan will never use its aggression policy again.</p>
<p>He also reported that although Canada's contribution to Asia during the war was not as great as that to Europe, the Canadian Navy assisted the US military in fighting in the Far East, and the sacrifices were also quite significant. During the war, Canada donated US$2.5 billion in supplies to the Allied countries, of which 40 million yuan was supplied to China, all drawn from Canadian people's taxes. In addition, the Canadian China Wartime Relief Fund Committee donates millions of US dollars in cash and materials to China every year. Now that the war has ended, this committee has been renamed the "Canadian Aid to China Committee" to continue its work in assisting China.</p>
<p>In addition, in the United Nations, Canada's contribution to China ranks third in the majority. After the war ended, Canada loaned US$60 million to help China's reconstruction. Canada has a population of only 12 million people, so every person is proud of their donations to help China. There are currently about 40,000 overseas Chinese in Canada. They are diligent in their work, very frugal, and very friendly to the Canadian people.</p>
<p>Dai is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to Beijing. During his stay in Shanghai, he also plans to visit the United Nations and discuss the [missing character] after the end of the United Nations with UNRRA Director General Rooks.</p>

<h3>Observations of Mr. Bullitt's Visit to China (Continued from Page Two)</h3>
<p>The contents of the Yalta Agreement are as follows:</p>
<p>"Agreement Regarding Japan:" The United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain agree that within two or three months after Germany's surrender and the end of the war in Europe, the Soviet Union will join the Allied side in the war against Japan, under the following conditions:</p>
<p>" Outer Mongolia shall maintain its current status as the Mongolian People's Republic.</p>
<p>" The rights of the Soviet Union violated by Japan in 1904 shall be restored: a) The southern part of Sakhalin Island and its adjacent islands shall be returned to the Soviet Union. b) Dalian shall be opened as an international commercial port, guaranteeing the Soviet Union's preferential interests in the area, and the lease of Lushun shall be restored as a Soviet naval base. c) The China Eastern Railway and the South Manchuria Railway, which are vital transportation routes to Dalian, shall be established as a joint Sino-Soviet company, jointly managed by the two countries, and it is understood that the Soviet Union's preferential interests must be guaranteed, while China retains its full sovereignty in Northeast China.</p>
<p>" The Kuril Islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"The agreements concerning Outer Mongolia, Dalian, and railways shall be subject to the approval of Chairman Chiang. The US President shall accept Chairman Stalin's opinion on this and seek to obtain his consent.</p>
<p>" The leading powers agree that the Soviet Union's demands must be fulfilled unconditionally after Japan is defeated. The Soviet Union hopes to sign the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Chinese Nationalist Government to provide military assistance to China to liberate it from Japanese occupation. Signed in Yalta, Soviet Union, on February 11, 1945, by Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill."</p>
<p>The first clause in the agreement means that the</p>
<p>Communist country</p>
<p>established by the Soviet Union in the Outer Mongolia region of China will forever be separated from China.</p>
<p>The second clause recognizes the "rights" that Russia obtained in Northeast China after the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 through brutal force. The so-called "rights" that the US government has always denied its validity and rejected by our "Open Door Policy" have thereby become legal, which tramples on the policies of John Hay and Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The second clause's b and c sections not only give the Soviet Union "preferential rights" in Dalian, an important port in Northeast China, and complete control over the Lushun naval base, but also give it preferential rights over the railways connecting the Soviet Union to Dalian, dividing the northwestern and southern parts of the Northeast provinces in half.</p>
<p>This is as if the United States' allies secretly reached an agreement with the Soviet Union, allowing the Soviet Union to obtain "preferential rights" in New York City, completely control the naval port defending the city, and also give it the "preferential rights" over the central railway connecting the Great Lakes region to New York City. Under such circumstances, even if someone seriously tells us that we still have full sovereignty in New York State, we must wonder how to fulfill this promise, which is really a bit incredible. Before the Red Army</p>
<p>looted Northeast China</p>
<p>of industrial equipment worth about two billion US dollars and loaded it away, Northeast China's industry accounted for 70% of the entire China. Its importance to China is no less than that of New York State to the United States. The Chinese feel that our way of fulfilling the Cairo promise is really too strange.</p>
<p>The two paragraphs after the second clause contain even more vicious contradictions. In the previous paragraph, President Roosevelt agreed to seek Chairman Chiang's approval for the Soviet Union's desire to encroach on the heart of Northeast China, while in the second paragraph, the three powers agreed that the Soviet Union's demands "must be fulfilled unconditionally." In other words, regardless of China's consent or not, it must be implemented. This kind of clause directly harms China, a loyal ally who began to resist Japan in 1937, and its ridiculousness and baseness are unprecedented in American diplomatic history.</p>
<p>All Americans know that after we joined World War II, President Roosevelt's foreign policy and his hope for the realization of world peace were based on a fantasy that he could transform Stalin's Soviet imperialism into democratic cooperation. Although President Roosevelt had said on February 10, 1940: "Anyone who has the courage to face the implementation knows that the Soviet Union is under</p>
<p>dictatorial rule</p>
<p>, its absolute nature is no different from any dictatorial country in the world," yet in formal international exchanges, he regarded the Soviet Union as a "peace-loving democratic country," as if calling a tiger a lamb would turn the tiger into a lamb. The tiger did not turn into a lamb; it swallowed half of Europe and extended its claws to China and Korea. Before President Truman delivered his speech on February 12, 1947, the US government had always adopted a ridiculous attitude, regarding the Soviet Union as a peace-loving democratic country, and the Chinese Communist Party as merely land reformers who did not obey Moscow. This point of view has created a series of bizarre actions for us in the Far East. (To be published tomorrow)</p>
<h3>A Shangri-La Discovered in the Old Guangshan Mountains of Peng County</h3>

<h3>Eight Institutes, Eighteen Years of Work: Report from the Academia Sinica Memorial Meeting</h3>
<p>— Li Shuhua</p>
<p>Today, our institute is holding its 18th anniversary celebration. We did not want to hold a large celebration, and we did not dare to trouble all parties, so we did not notify all parties in advance. Originally, the 18th anniversary of our institute was September 9th of this year. At that time, it was too late, so it was decided to postpone it for one month. Today is October 9th, the day before National Day. Therefore, holding the 18th anniversary celebration today also has the significance of celebrating National Day in advance.</p>
<p>Our institute began preparations in November of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928) and was officially established on September 9th of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929). As of September 9th of this year, it has been a full 18 years. Our institute currently has a general office and eight research institutes: Physics, Chemistry, Pharmacology, Physiology, Zoology, Botany, and History. Our institute and the National Northwest United College jointly established the China Northwest Botanical Survey Institute. Before the War of Resistance, our institute had a Geology Research Institute, which was a collaboration with the Geological Survey Institute of the Ministry of Industry and was entirely led by Mr. Weng Wenhao. When the War of Resistance broke out, our institute faced financial difficulties, and Mr. Weng advocated: "Funding is temporarily suspended, but the relationship remains." The funding for the Geology Research Institute was temporarily suspended, but the relationship of investigation and research remained the same.</p>
<p>From Stability to Turbulence</p>
<p>From the 18th year of the Republic of China, our institute was established.</p>
<p>From the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929) when our institute was established to the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) was a period of stability. During this period, the research institutes of our institute completely focused on pure research work. Although they often conducted field surveys, collections, or excavations, they were always looking for materials for research in the laboratory. During this period, our colleagues at the institute made significant contributions in the academic field.</p>
<p>From the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) to the present, the past ten years of work have involved relocation, work during the War of Resistance, restoration, and the restoration of original work after the war. Before the July 7th Incident, our institute first moved the Physics and Pharmacology Research Institutes to Shanghai, and the Botany Research Institute to Wugong, Shaanxi. The relocated departments continued to work as usual. After the fall of Beiping and Tianjin, the work of our institute in Beiping came to a standstill. The general office of our institute and the Physics, Chemistry, Physiology, Zoology, and History Research Institutes moved to Kunming. Important books, instruments, and medicines were salvaged from Beiping after its fall, passing through Tianjin, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Haiphong to reach Kunming. We were able to work in Kunming for more than eight years, entirely relying on these salvaged books, instruments, and medicines. This salvage was truly a miracle! Later, the Radium and Pharmacology Research Institutes in Shanghai also moved to Kunming. A portion of the Botany Research Institute also moved to Kunming. During the War of Resistance, our institute, in addition to laboratory work, especially focused on applied research, while also paying attention to investigations and research with academic or economic value.</p>
<p>From Victory to Restoration</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, our institute sent Mr. Qian Linzhao and Mr. Su Bingqi to Beiping to take over. The departments of our institute gradually returned to their original locations in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946). The original buildings of our institute in Beiping had been occupied by the enemy and puppets, and were heavily damaged during the takeover, but have been gradually repaired. The books, instruments, and furniture left by our institute in Beiping were heavily damaged and lost. Fortunately, the first batch of 247 boxes of books and instruments arrived in Beiping from Kunming via Changsha, Hankou, Shanghai, and Tianjin on January 27th of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), allowing the research institutes to resume most of their work. Currently, the second batch of 162 boxes of books, instruments, and medicines has been transported from Kunming to Shanghai, and will soon be transported back to Beiping. In addition, there are about six or seven hundred more boxes of books and specimens in the Northwest, and books and instruments in Shanghai, which we cannot afford to transport back all at once. During the restoration, our institute purchased two private houses to use as staff dormitories. Mr. Su Chengqi contributed the most to the purchase of these dormitories. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Prices Soar in Other Ports, Buying Interest is Strong: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Reach New Peaks, Rayon Up 15 Million Compared to Before the Holiday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, although there was the news that yarn registration was beneficial to the yarn market, the market still rose frantically, because yarn prices in other ports were high, and Jinhan and other gangs had a strong intention to import. Local dyeing and weaving factories added raw materials due to the high price of cloth, and their appetite was very strong. Combined with new buyers participating, the market momentum was soaring. In the end, 42-count yarn rose by a huge 5.4 million yuan compared to before the holiday. It also created a new peak of 25 million yuan. 20-count special changes immediately rose by 2.2 million yuan, light changes immediately rose by 2.24 million yuan, 16-count Guangming rose by 2.26 million yuan, and the prices of other counts of thick and thin yarns also rose in unison by more than 2 million yuan to 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's cotton cloth market: The opening was flat and the undertone was firm, but because actual sales were very smooth in various places, and there were also outside parties coming in to purchase, Fang Jian sold low-end fine cloths, and the listed prices were greatly increased, but there were not many varieties. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth has not been supplied for a long time. Private dyeing factories and cloth factories have also reduced sales due to increased labor and material costs, resulting in a consistent rise in the prices of all cloths. In the end, all grades of fine cloth rose by 356,000 yuan compared to before the holiday, serge surged by 67,000 to 155,000 yuan, Shilin cloth also rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, and other bleached coarse cloths and colored cloths all reached new peaks.</p>

<p>Rayon has been hovering for several days, and it rose madly again yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand shiny 3A goods were only 61 million yuan at the opening, and 1A goods were 68 million yuan, but because news of favorable purchases from all parties frequently came, the rise continued. By the close of the midday market, the spot price had reached as high as 73 million yuan, and the afternoon price was sold at 76 million yuan, an increase of 15 million yuan compared to Thursday.</p>
<p>The factory quoted a retail price of 57.8 million yuan yesterday morning, but because rayon rose madly, people's hearts were prosperous, and everyone raised prices in unison.

<p>Spot Cotton Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was firm and prices rose again. Because yarn and cloth rose sharply, people's hearts were high, and there was a strong desire to absorb. Because flower prices were too high, yarn factories were reluctant to import, so transactions were not prosperous, and most transactions were sporadic. The highest price for Lingshi was 4.46 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Huoji rose by 200,000 yuan, and other grades also followed up by about 100,000 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 19,800 stones of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The market situation was very chaotic due to the rise in prices in the mainland and fluctuations in prices outside the market. Japonica and indica rice rose in unison by 450,000 yuan, and high-quality japonica has exceeded the 700,000 yuan mark. The allocation of flour is still only No. 3 flour, and the price remains the same, but there are many buyers in the market, and few suppliers, so the price has risen wildly by more than 10,000 yuan. The bran owners are also firm, with prices rising sharply by more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cakes are not left behind, and also follow the rise by 10,000 yuan. The stock of soybeans is low, and buyers are firm, continuing to rise by 230,000 yuan.

<h3>Active Domestic Tea Sales</h3>
<p>Domestic tea, which has been in high demand in this city and the Suzhou-Wuxi area for a long time, continued to be actively traded yesterday, further boosting confidence. Sellers are consistently raising prices, leading to a continued price increase. Although there have been inquiries about export varieties from exporters, prices have not been relaxed due to the impact of low overseas tea prices. Holders are increasingly firm in their willingness to sell, creating a situation of standoff between supply and demand, and transactions remain sluggish. Market sentiment is resistant to inactivity, with a general upward trend, but Keemun black tea, with ample supply, is in a holding pattern.</p>
<p>Hunan Tea Exports</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 10th] Tea is one of Hunan's export goods, with Anhua and Linxiang having the largest production. Since the war, sales have sharply decreased. After the victory, many tea companies were established, and the varieties have been improved daily. For example, Anhua black tea can already rival Keemun, but it is a pity that the products are not consistent. The Hunan Tea Company has already shipped tens of thousands of dan through Shanghai, which can be exported abroad. It is expected that sales can increase in the future.</p>
<h3>Inconsistent Rise and Fall of Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the buying interest in cigarettes remained strong, and the market sentiment was still good. In the end, each carton of ten British cigarettes rose by 50,000 yuan, while "Old Knife" cigarettes fell back. Chinese cigarettes and American 50-stick carton cigarettes all continued to rise by 2,000 to over 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Rise</h3>
<p>The soap market was quiet due to the silence of factory distribution news. The shop assistants inside the market are quite healthy, and with external pulling, the "Guben" brand rose another 30,000 yuan, "Arrow Knife" soap rose 25,000 yuan, and "Huang Xiangguanghua" and "Cow Brand" soaps also rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Old-brand Phoenix and Beauty matches sold well and the price rose back by 100,000 yuan, and other new brand goods also rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Sentiment Is Lively, and Ronghua Stocks Are Easy to Rise but Difficult to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, stimulated by the rise in gold, banknotes, and the black market, Chinese stocks showed a trend of being easy to rise but difficult to fall. Both China Merchants and Zhabei Cement had a large number of buyers, announcing a price ceiling, especially with the support of bank assistance for Zhabei Water and Electricity, which was even more profitable. Yongsha and other stocks retreated after rising, and it is still difficult for the trend of miscellaneous stocks to be universally good.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>Showing promise, No. 116 bought after the opening, and No. 94 and No. 130 respectively closed out spot and forward Yongsha. The price once fell from 308 yuan and 316 yuan to a low of 308 yuan for spot and 316 yuan for forward delivery. The black market for gold and banknotes was surprisingly hot, and the market sentiment was unstoppable. Under the absorption of No. 180 and others in Zhabei, it was very strong. No. 14 and others bought spot Yongsha, No. 32 and others bought forward Yongsha. China Merchants, Zhabei, and Cement were raised by No. 231, No. 152, and No. 149, respectively, to the price ceiling. The off-site interest rate also fell to 1.95 and 2.4. At 10:30, it rose to a high price of 326 yuan for spot and 330 yuan for forward delivery. After 10:40, there was news of loans again, and No. 85 and others sold off one after another, and began to fall back. Spot Yongsha was sold by No. 24, and forward delivery was closed by No. 218. Many retail investors also sold, and near noon, it fell to a low of 315 yuan and 319 yuan. No. 45 and others bought one after another, and then closed at prices of 319 yuan and 323 yuan. Zhabei was still absorbed by No. 152 and No. 180 and stood at the price ceiling. The rise in underclothing stocks was also high. As a result, compared with the spot stocks last Saturday, Zhabei rose to the price ceiling, and China Merchants Cement rose to the limit and then retreated, squeezing up by about 10%. Underclothing rose by 10%, Huajing Lunhao by 50%, Xinhua China Silk slightly fell, Hengying was flat, and the rest were slightly up. In terms of spot stocks, Meiya rose by less than 50%, and the rest were slightly up. The old stocks in the off-site market, except for Dasheng and others, were still flat, and the rest were trending upwards.</p>
<h3>Gradual Improvement in Exports: Optimistic Prospects for Our Raw Silk; Expected to Increase by 50,000 Dan Within Three Years</h3>
<p>For this year's raw silk, the government has already started purchasing and is finding ways to sell it to various countries. According to Mr. Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Silk Company: There is no problem with this year's raw silk exports. Spring silk can collect 15,000 dan, and autumn silk was originally planned to be 5,000 dan, but due to price reasons, only 30% was collected, about 1,500 dan, totaling only over 16,000 dan. An American silk merchant alone purchases 500 dan of our raw silk every month. The United States currently has 60,000 bales of Japanese silk in stock, but still orders from us, which proves that our raw silk is still needed by Americans. The reason for this need is that our quality is higher than that of Japan. Our raw silk has its place in the international market.</p>
<p>At present, calculated according to the black market, our raw silk can be fully exported. Even calculated according to the market price, it is gradually approaching the actual cost, so the prospects for raw silk are quite optimistic. If we can continue to implement the silk weaving guidance plan, we will definitely be able to increase by 50,000 dan within three years, and can restore the pre-war quantity of 100,000 dan in five years. Domestic sales are also gradually increasing. Not only can silk and socks be woven, but silkworm cocoons can also be used for silk quilts and cotton robes, with a wide range of uses. General concerns are not a problem.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Slightly Rise, Foreign Stocks Rebound</h3>
<p>Public bonds rose slightly yesterday. The unified bond C opened at 15,200 yuan in the morning. 552 and Dachengxing advanced to 15,900 yuan. 360 and 555 sold off, falling to 15,100 yuan and then selling. As a result, compared with before National Day, Class A and B bonds rose by 200 yuan, Class C and D bonds rose slightly by 100 yuan, and the unified bond E rose by 500 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 5 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks rebounded again yesterday due to the stimulation of gold and banknotes. Yisha opened at 180,000 yuan in the morning, reaching a high price of 190,000 yuan, and then struggled around 183,000 yuan. Bank assistance and retail investors bought in large numbers. As a result, compared with before National Day, Jardine Matheson and Swire rose by 10%, Yeguang Paper Industry and Copper Industry each rose by 50%, Yibier and Shipping were flat, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Banks and Bureaus Continued to Ease Credit</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] National banks and bureaus continued to issue 20.4 billion yuan at the bill exchange yesterday, and credit continued to ease.

Yesterday, the Central Bank put in 23.9 billion yuan, the large exchange put in 16.1 billion yuan, and foreign merchants put in 38.4 billion yuan.

<h3>This Year's Zhejiang Cotton and Linen Can Be Expected to Collect 80-90%</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, recently returned from inspecting the cotton and linen production areas in Zhejiang. According to him, this year's Zhejiang cotton and linen production area is drier, so it is expected that about 80-90% can be collected. This year's cotton production in the province is expected to reach about 350,000 dan. Among them, Dex cotton accounts for more than 10,000 dan, Tuo cotton accounts for more than 40,000 dan, and the rest are local cotton. The previous market price was mostly calculated based on the rice price, with Dex cotton at 10 jin of rice per jin, Tuo cotton at 7.5 jin of rice per jin, and local cotton at 6 jin of rice per jin. Recently, the rice price in the cotton production area is about 3,500 yuan per jin. In order to actively promote and expand next year, cotton production can reach 800,000 dan. In terms of linen production, the original target for this year was 300,000 dan, and now about 200,000 dan can be harvested. Compared with Indian and Taiwanese linen varieties, it is the most popular. Currently, one dan of linen is about half a dou.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank's Agricultural Loans for This Year Total Over 900 Billion</h3>
<p>The Agricultural Bank of China is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting in Beijing on the second of next month. In addition to reporting on business and financial results, it will also decide on the distribution of profits.</p>
<p>It is also learned that, according to Mr. Xue You, Assistant Manager of the Bank, agricultural loans totaled over 900 billion this year, with silkworm loans being the most. Loans for spring and autumn totaled over 400 billion, followed by cotton loans, which totaled over 130 billion. Ordinary agricultural loans totaled 100 billion, tea loans over 80 billion, tobacco loans 28 billion, plus various reconstruction loans in the Yellow River flood area, totaling over 900 billion.</p>
<p>Future business will continue to promote national policy, with production as the main loan target, because the only urgent task for our country today is to increase production. Fertilizers needed for grain production will be given special attention.</p>
<p>The morning loan plan for next year is being drafted and will be sent to the Four Banks Joint Office for final approval. The principles will not change, only technical issues and the amount of agricultural loans will be increased or decreased. However, the bank's funds are limited, and it is currently difficult to meet the needs of all parties, but it has fully fulfilled its responsibilities in the overall national policy.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Shipped to the Soviet Union for Barter</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau is actively preparing to ship barter goods to the Soviet Union since the contract was signed. It is reported that tung oil is the main barter material from the Bureau to the Soviet Union. One thousand tons of tung oil in barrels were shipped from Shanghai the day before yesterday, and another 500 tons can be shipped by the end of this month. There are also 3,500 tons of tung oil in bulk, which the Bureau is purchasing from Sichuan and other places, totaling 5,000 tons. After this batch of tung oil is shipped, other materials will be shipped.</p>
<h3>National Grain Merchant Representatives Petition the Central Government Again</h3>
<p>The initiators' meeting of the National Federation of Grain Trade Associations was held at 2:00 p.m. on the 10th at the South Rice Market. Grain associations from all over the country sent representatives to Shanghai to participate, with a total of more than 60 representatives. As a result, Huang Tongsheng, Chuan Changyu, Wan Molin, Wang Xingpu, Chen Jiali, Cai Yushu, Zhang Chao, Zhang Jingwei, Qu Zhenhua, and other twenty-one people were appointed as preparatory commissioners to organize the preparatory committee and promote all preparatory affairs. The discussion on continuing to request the government to exempt grain business tax lasted for a long time. It was unanimously believed that this was not a matter of grain alone, and directly and indirectly affected people's livelihood greatly. When a bag of rice is transshipped and sold, its business tax can be levied as many as three or four times, which is also one of the reasons for the rise in rice prices. Wang, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, is scheduled to convene representatives from chambers of commerce and grain associations from all over the country at 2:00 p.m. today to hold a joint meeting to discuss the matter in detail, and will send several representatives to Beijing again on behalf of merchants from all over the country to petition the government, requesting the government to immediately order the exemption of grain business tax in order to stabilize the people's food and the people's hearts.</p>

<h3>Character Depiction in "Ode to the Luo River Goddess"</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>When I lecture on fu (rhapsody) in school, I often feel a common phenomenon that is almost the same everywhere. Needless to say, Qu Yuan's "Li Sao" is not as easily accepted by students as his "Nine Songs." Even Geng Zishan, the great master of fu, his "Lament for Jiangnan" and "Small Garden Fu" are not very popular with students. At that time, we were still fighting the war of resistance, and the scenes of displacement in "Lament for Jiangnan" can be said to be vividly written, but the students did not like it. Maybe it was because their understanding was not enough, or they had too little personal experience, I thought at the time.</p>
<p>However, whenever I talked about Cao Zijian's "Ode to the Luo River Goddess," surprisingly, it was always very popular with students. This is naturally not because I have any unique insights into the Ode, and the students are not stubborn stones either. They naturally find it easier to understand a divinely depicted article than some overly solemn and abstract articles. Therefore, it also enlightened my attention to and research interest in the depiction of figures in the Ode to the Luo River Goddess. Because of this attention (I have always been good at reading books without seeking thorough understanding), I realized that this Prince Chen Si, of whom people said, "The world's literature is one stone, and Zijian alone gets eight dou," made his name famous with the Ode, but it was just a piece of brocade assembled from various sources. However, he also has one advantage, that is, his plain sketches and group portraits of characters are all written so vividly and logically clear. Only this point, in terms of the composition of the writing and the depiction of figures, should be in the first class.</p>
<p>Here, for the sake of saving space, I will first talk about the advantages of his depiction of figures, and then give a few examples to see the organization and arrangement of this kind of sentence structure and the origin of the adjectives, so as to be used as a brick to attract jade for the erudite gentlemen who are interested in studying the "Ode to the Luo River Goddess":</p>
<p>The beginning of the Ode to the Luo River Goddess is no different from the atmosphere of the Wei and Jin Dynasties, so we don't have to pay attention to it. It is just a brief introduction saying how he passed the Luo River and wrote the fu because of his feelings for Zhen. However, in these short forty-one characters, it clearly tells us that it is just: "Feeling for Song Yu's story of the goddess of King Chu, I then wrote this fu." It can be seen that everything is a dream art of the daytime, and what he sees and hears are all completely fictitious. This was the beginning of the abuse of fu at that time, and it is not enough to be used as a basis.</p>
<p>First of all, what Cao Zijian showed us was a number of portraits of beauties, from far to near, with clear layers. In the section "Yu gao zhi ri" (On the day I told him) below, first is a plain sketch of an outline, and from "bian xian de zhong" (her proportions were well-balanced) onward, it is meticulous brushwork. The two sentences "Pian ruo jing hong, wan ruo you long" (Light as a startled swan, graceful as a swimming dragon) describe the "dynamic" state of the goddess when viewed from a distance. The two sentences "Rong yao qiu ju, hua mao chun song" (Radiant as autumn chrysanthemums, flourishing as spring pines) describe her static state. The following two sentences, "Fang fo xi, ruo qing yun zhi bi yue; piao piao xi, ruo liu feng zhi hui xue" (Seeming to float like light clouds veiling the moon; drifting like swirling snow in a flowing wind) also describe the former in a static state and the latter in a dynamic state. After this general description is finished, he uses two sentences to especially show the goddess's beauty when viewed from afar and up close: "Yuan er wang zhi, jiao ruo tai yang sheng zhao xia; po er cha zhi, zhuo ruo fu qu chu lu bo" (Viewed from afar, she is as radiant as the morning sun rising from the rosy clouds; observed from close up, she is as dazzling as a lotus flower emerging from rippling water). This kind of plain sketch of a figure can be said to be perfect.</p>
<p>Next, Cao Zijian used the meticulous painting method of Qiu Shizhou's meticulous beauties to meticulously sculpt a statue of the goddess of the Luo River, first writing from the figure to the face, and then returning to the clothing. It is truly a subtle description of classicism. Let's try to see:</p>
<p>"De zhong xiu duan he du, jian ruo xue cheng, yao ruo yue su" (Her height and shortness were well-proportioned, her shoulders like they were carved, her waist like tied silk); (describing the figure) "Yan jing xiu xiang, hao zhi cheng lu, fang ze wu jia, qian hua fu yu" (Her slender neck and fair nape were exposed, no fragrance was added, no powder was applied); (describing natural charm) "Yun ti e e, xiu mei lian juan, dan chun wai lang, hao chi nei xian; ming mou shan lai, fu cheng quan" (Her cloud-like hair was high, her slender eyebrows were connected, her red lips were bright, her white teeth were fresh; her bright eyes were good at glancing, her cheekbones supported her cheeks); (describing facial beauty) "Huan zi yan yi, yi jing ti xian, rou qing chuo tai, mei yu yu yan" (Her ringed posture was beautiful, her demeanor was quiet and her body leisurely, her soft emotions were graceful, charming beyond words); (describing beauty of demeanor) "Pi luo yi zhi chan xi, er yao bi zhi hua ju, dai jin cui zhi shou shi, zhui ming zhu yi yao ya; jian yuan you zhi wen qun, ye wu shao zhi chang ju" (She wore a silk robe of bright colors, earrings of jade and jasper, headdress of gold and kingfisher feathers, adorned with bright pearls to illuminate the belt; she walked on patterned shoes, trailing a mist-like skirt); (describing beauty of clothing)…"</p>
<p>This whole section is deliberately writing out the "static" beauty of the goddess of the Luo River, and below it describes her "dynamic" state and the relationship of the honor guard:</p>
<p>"Hu yan zong ti, yi yao yi xi" (Suddenly she gives way to her body, to invite and frolic); (moving like a fleeing rabbit) "Zuo yi cai mao, you yin gua qi" (Leaning on a colorful staff on the left, shielding with a hanging banner on the right); (honor guard)…"</p>
<p>Following closely, he also writes out his own feelings of "delighting in her beauty" and the action of "entrusting words through subtle waves," so the two hearts are in tune, close yet distant, written as if in a daze, hazy:</p>
<p>"Yu shi luo ling gan yan, xi yi pang huang, shen guang li he, zha yin zha yang" (Therefore the goddess of the Luo River was moved, drifting and hesitating, her divine light separated and converged, sometimes dark and sometimes bright); (the goddess's inner contradiction is manifested in her external image) "Song qing qu yi he li, ruo jiang fei er wei xiang" (Raising her light body like a crane standing, as if about to fly but not yet flying); (manifestation of an uneasy wavering psychology)"</p>
<p>Having written to this point, Cao Zijian suddenly writes with divine brushstrokes, turning movement from stillness. Having written that the goddess of the Luo River is moved and without a master, he continues with a long sigh to express eternal longing, or to decide on the company of her sisters; this is the most subtle way to write about a daughter's attitude. Therefore, it seems that eight dou of literary thoughts gush forth like a spring, suddenly rising and falling like a rabbit, and the pen like a swimming dragon directly pours out without reservation. This kind of pen that suddenly turns from the depiction of one person to the depiction of a group portrait, touching upon every branch and leaf, is truly impossible to catch up with:</p>
<p>"　　　　　　, ming　　chang" (summoning each other); "wei xi qing liu, ke　　qing, huo cai ming zhu, huo shi　yu" (Playing and laughing in the clear stream, they are admirable, some picking bright pearls, some picking jade feathers); (describing the dynamic state of the gods - group) "Ti xun fei niao, hu hu ruo shen, ling bi wei bu, luo mo sheng qing; dong wu chang ze, ruo wei ruo an, zi zhi nan qi, ruo wang ruo huan" (Their bodies are as swift as flying birds, and their movements are as sudden as gods, crossing over with subtle steps, their gauze skirts produce joy; their movements have no constant rules, sometimes dangerous and sometimes safe, their stopping is difficult to predict, sometimes going and sometimes returning); (describing the movement of the group - detailed writing, exhausting the ability to be boundless and hazy; the four "or" words in front, and the four "ruo" words in the back, echo each other, precisely because it is in conjecture, so using this kind of hesitant words, all the more increases its hazy beauty) "Han ci wei tu, qi ruo you lan, hua rong e nuo, ling wo wang sun" (Holding words yet unspoken, their breath is like a secluded orchid, their beautiful faces are graceful, causing me to forget my meals…); (describing a state of dazzling colors)."</p>
<p>From the above paragraphs, we can clearly see how Cao Zijian used the form of a narrative poem (I always like to compare fu to narrative poems, of course, in the past, the lyrical component in fu was still very heavy, perhaps because the Chinese nation has always valued the purely lyrical form?)</p>
<p>In these paragraphs, we can undoubtedly see that he focused on the depiction of figures; (of course, in "Gao Tang Fu," "Deng Tuzi's Love of Beauty Fu," and "Goddess Fu," they are also written in this way, which was naturally not created by Cao Zijian; regarding this aspect, we will briefly discuss it below) First of all, he writes out the distant and close appearance of the goddess of the Luo River, then writes the outline, then adds color, then writes from static to dynamic, and then writes the group portrait… Such a well-organized description is really worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Regarding the benefits that the "Ode to the Luo River Goddess" gained from its predecessors, there are truly too many to count. Here I will only list a few key points and briefly cite them. If the reader has a mind to do so, it will not be difficult to understand the source of the words and sentences.</p>
<p>First of all, Cao Zijian's section of setting up the conversation, simulating the response between the edge of the Luo River and the driver, can be said to be completely using the old rules of "Gao Tang" and "Goddess" fu. Try to see:</p>
<p>"Hu yan si san, fu ze wei cha, yang yi shu guan, du yi li ren, yu qi zhi pan, nai yuan yu zhe er gao zhi yue: 'Er you guan yu bi zhe hu, bi he ren si, ruo ci zhi fei ye?' Yu zhe dui yue: 'Chen wen qiao he luo zhi shen, ming ri Mi Fei; ran ze jun wang suo jian, wu nai shi hu? Qi zhuang ruo he, chen yuan wen zhi'…" (Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River)</p>
<p>"Xi zhe, Chu Xiang Wang yu Song Yu you yu Yunmeng zhi tai… Wang yue: 'Xi zhe xian wang, zeng you Gao Tang, dai er hua qin,' Wang yue: 'Shi wei gua ren fu zhi'…" (Gao Tang Fu)</p>
<p>"Chu Xiang Wang yu Song Yu you yu Yunmeng zhi pu… Qi ye wang qin, guo meng yu shen nv yu, qi zhuang shen li, wang yi zhi, ming ri yi bai yu, Wang yue: 'Qi meng ruo he?'…" (Goddess Fu)</p>
<p>Here, we can see that the "Gao Tang" and "Goddess" fu both say the same story of King Xiang of Chu and Song Yu traveling in Yunmeng. The settings can be said to be completely similar, perhaps one thing was derived into two. As for the bathing goddess fu, it borrows no more than two points from the former: (1) using the dialogue between two people, followed by a fu on the beauty of a woman, (2) using the goddess to express secluded thoughts. In terms of narration, there is not much influence. But in the back, there are many places enough to see that Cao Zijian used the descriptive methods of his predecessors:</p>
<p>"Yuan er ting zhi, ruo zao feng he ming xi yun zhong; po er cha zhi, ruo zhong pa shu rong yao chun feng" (Listened to from afar, it is like a phoenix and a lark harmonizing and playing in the clouds; observed from close up, it is like many flowers blooming and illuminating the spring breeze)…" (Qin Fu)</p>
<p>"Yuan er wang zhi, jiao ruo tai yang sheng zhao xia; po er cha zhi, zhuo ruo fu qu chu lu bo" (Viewed from afar, she is as radiant as the morning sun rising from the rosy clouds; observed from close up, she is as dazzling as a lotus flower emerging from rippling water)…" (Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River) "Qi shi lai ye: Yao hu ruo bai ri chu chu zhao wu liang; qi shao jin ye, jiao ruo ming yue shu qi guang" (When she first comes, she shines like the white sun initially coming out to illuminate the house beams; when she advances slightly, she is as bright as the bright moon spreading its light)…" (Goddess Fu)</p>
<p>"Qi shi chu ye: Mang xi ruo song zhi, qi shao jin ye, zhe jin ruo jiao ji, yang mei zhang ri er wang suo si" (When she first emerges, she is blurred like a pine branch; when she advances slightly, she is as clear as a beautiful woman, raising her sleeves to block the sun and look at what she thinks of)…" (Gao Tang Fu)</p>
<p>The above are rough descriptions of the goddess in four fu (Qin fu describes the beauty of sound), and below we will look at their meticulous paintings:</p>
<p>"……Huai zi wei tai, bu ke sheng zan……Qi sheng shi ye: Ze luo zhi qi hui sheng wen zhang, ji fu miao cai zhao wan fang; zhen zhi yi, bei gui chang, li bu duan, xian bu chang, bu yi yi xi yao dian tang; hu xi gai rong, wan ruo you long cheng yun xiang……Gu fa duo qi, ying jun zhi xiang……Wen run zhi yu yan……Mei juan juan yi e yang xi, zhu chun zhuo qi ruo dan; su zhi gan zhi zhi shi xi, zhi jie tai er ti xian……" (Goddess Fu)</p>
<p>"……Chen jian jia zhi zi, zeng zhi yi fen ze tai chang, jian zhi yi fen ze tai duan; zhuo fen ze tai bai, shi zhu ze tai chi. Mei ru cui yu, ji ru bai xue; yao ru shu su, chi ru han bei……" (Deng Tuzi's Love of Beauty Fu)</p>
<p>"Nong xian de zhong, xiu duan he du, jian ruo xue cheng, yao ruo yue su; yan jing xiu xiang, hao zhi cheng lu. Fang ze wu jia, qian bi fu yu……Xiu mei lian juan, dan chun wai lang, hao chi nei xian……" (Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River)</p>
<p>As for the pen that writes about the mutual affection of the two, there are also quite a few similarities. Try to see:</p>
<p>"Sai yu wei er qing yu xi, yuan jin xin zhi juan juan……Chen jia ci er yun dui xi, tu fen fang qi ruo lan. Jing jiao jie yi lai wang xi, xin kai kang yi le huan; shen du xiang er zhu jie xi, hun qiong qiong yi wu duan." (Goddess Fu)</p>
<p>"Dong zhu chun yi xu yan, chen jiao jie zhi da gang……Kang luo mei yi yan ti xi, lei liu jin zhi lang lang……" (Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River)</p>
<p>Of course, these are not treating Cao Zijian as a literary plagiarist, because since the Han and Wei dynasties, it has indeed become a fashion to quote each other to prove one's point. For example, in the nineteen ancient poems, "Qing Qing He Pan Cao," "Qing Qing He Bian Cao," "Qing Qing Ling Shang Bo"… "Zhong You Chi Su Shu," "Nu Li Jia Sun Fan," etc., then it can be known that one person cannot shift the trend of the times.</p>
<p>The Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River naturally benefited from more than just these few articles. Traces can be found in the "Shuo Ren San Zhang" in the Book of Songs, the "Mountain Spirit" in the Chu Ci, as well as the Xiao Fu, Qin Fu, and Sheng Fu… We should not use this to spread rumors about Cao Zijian. It is precisely because of this that we know what is called "integration"!</p>
<p>In short, the artistic integrity of the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River is flawless, especially in using such a short fu to depict the image of a person. It not only shows that the skill is very deep, but also that the writing comes from divine inspiration! In addition, the strength of the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River is that Cao Zijian injected true emotions into it. Therefore, the article is written with poignant emotion and continuous thoughts, which is also beyond the reach of the superficial and exaggerated literature of the Wei and Jin dynasties.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Notes from the Listening Frog Pavilion</p>
<p>The wild recluse Zai Shu says: "Du Fu's poems often did not conform to the rules, so matters that did not conform to the rules were called 'du zhuan' (杜撰, fabricated). However, looking at the popular expressions 'du tian' (杜田, fake field) and 'du guo' (杜國, fake country), the 'du' here means 'false.' For example, saying 'du jiu' (杜酒, fake wine) of one's own weak wine. This is the same meaning as 'du zhuan'."</p>
<p>Note: The characters 杜 (du) and 土 (tu) were commonly used interchangeably in ancient times. The Poetry Classic's "Xiao Yue" (鴞) says, "Che bi sang tu" (徹彼桑土, tear up that mulberry land); Guo Pu's annotation in the Fang Yan (方言, Regional Words) quotes it as "Che bi sang du" (徹彼桑杜). Also, the Poetry Classic's "Da Ya Mian" (大雅綿) says, "Zi tu ju qi" (自土沮漆, from the soil of Ju and Qi); Yan Shigu's annotation in the Hanshu (漢書, Book of Han) says that the Qi version of the poem says, "Zi du ju qi" (自杜沮漆). Also, "xiang tu" (相土, inspect the soil) is also written as "cheng du" (乘杜), and Yang Liang's annotation in the Xunzi (荀子) says, "Du is the same as tu." The Qing Teng Shan Ren's Lu Shi (路史) says, "Du, ben tu pu. Sang tu guo tu, bing yin qu sheng, gu xiang yan she tu er zhi yong du." (杜本土普。桑土國土，並音去聲，故相沿捨土而直用杜, Du originally means earth. Sang tu and guo tu are both pronounced in the falling tone, so people followed the custom of abandoning tu and directly using du.) The modern scholar Zhu Qifeng's Ci Tong (辭通) Volume 13 says, "Du cong tu sheng, gu yu yi tong tu, zuo yi tu you zuo yun du ye." (杜從土聲，故宇亦通土，作義土又作雲杜也, Du takes its sound from tu, so the word is also interchangeable with tu, meaning earth and also cloud du.)</p>
<p>Thus, what the world calls "du zhuan" is like saying "tu zao" (土造, made of earth), meaning it has no basis in the classics and comes from one's own private ideas. Homemade wine is called "du jiu," and creating words out of thin air is called "du zhuan," both meaning that they have no basis. Therefore, one should not simply say that it means "fake wine" or "fake creation."</p>
<p>Also, "Xiang Shan Ye Lu (湘山野錄) records that when Sheng Wenpiegong wrote the Shen Dao Stele for Wen Jie, Shi Canzheng Zhongli urgently asked, 'Who wrote it?' Sheng passed away and said, 'Du zhuan' (度撰, guessed). The whole hall burst into laughter. Since Wen Su was before Du Mo, he knew that the saying 'du zhuan' had existed for a long time."</p>
<p>Note: The response in the document is extremely clear. The so-called "du zhuan" means "zi zhuan" (自撰, self-composed). Later generations, not understanding that du and tu were interchangeable, seeing the words "du zhuan," insisted on dragging out a person named Du, such as Du Mo, to fabricate historical events, creating wild and distorted interpretations. The eras are inconsistent and impassable, thus causing the doubts of the Xiang Shan Ye Lu.</p>
<p>Creating a historical event about Du Mo as the root of the term "du zhuan," which is impassable, and then dragging out the affair of Du Tingguang, saying, "The Taoist canon has 5,000 volumes, but only the two volumes of the Tao Te Ching are genuine, and the rest were all composed by the Shu Taoist Du Tingguang, hence the term 'du zhuan'" (see Xiang Shan Ye Lu), is also uninformed.</p>
<h3>Poetic Aphorisms</h3>
<p>My poems are all impromptu, inspired by reality, and based on reality as a solid foundation. — Goethe.</p>
<p>Poetry is the truth, transferred by the power of passion and vitality like the earth, to the hearts of others. — Wordsworth.</p>
<p>No poet can write about something he has never experienced. — Ibsen. Xian Song</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, I've seen a lot of people like those two kinds. It's possible to find one or two people as beautiful as you and as capable as that young comrade in those packs of foxes and dogs. But they can't be as upright and steady as you two. Those guys, more or less, carry five parts wickedness and five parts baseness…"</p>
<p>This guy suddenly coughed violently, probably because he spoke too quickly and choked on his trachea. He hurriedly helped himself, grabbed the teapot and teacup on the table, waited on himself, and swallowed a big cup.</p>
<p>"…Later, when I got to the restaurant on Nanma Road, I inquired about the three kinds of dim sum you two ordered. Although they were quite substantial, including the small account, they only cost one yuan and twenty-three cents, which made my previous assumptions even clearer. But I still couldn't grasp what you two were. When I got to Bridge No. 2, you two parted ways, which then confirmed two points. You're either secret agents working for the Japanese or Chinese secret agents. But the former is just a reference. Like I said, with your two's mettle, you absolutely can't work as running dogs for the Japanese. Those things, ten out of ten, are all crooked-eyed and have the bones of a dog… So you two must be on the side of the Chinese…"</p>
<p>"That young comrade is really amazing. His legs can truly be called flying legs! I was riding my bicycle and almost ran out of breath. I caught up in front and followed you for about two miles before I was sure of your actions. That young master is overly alert, and even with someone as experienced as me, dodging here and there, I still couldn't escape his attention. On the one hand, I was still worried about this end, so I hurried back…" Speaking of which, this guy cracked open his purplish-green thick lips again, and slanted his two sunken eyes, giggling:…</p>
